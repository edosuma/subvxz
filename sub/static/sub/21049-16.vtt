WEBVTT

00:07.132 --> 00:08.883
[Joanne moans and chuckles]

00:12.220 --> 00:13.721
Okay. [clears throat]

00:14.764 --> 00:16.724
Okay, not that I...

00:16.808 --> 00:20.062
I don't like what's happening,
but what's happening?

00:21.229 --> 00:23.148
I'm sorry. That was forward.

00:23.231 --> 00:24.857
[chuckles]

00:24.941 --> 00:27.610
But when I'm with you,
I couldn't be happier.

00:27.694 --> 00:30.113
And when I'm not,
I can't wait for you to come back.

00:31.406 --> 00:33.741
-You're like hunting season.
-[chuckles]

00:34.617 --> 00:37.954
Well, right now I think you're...
you're hunting without a permit.

00:39.414 --> 00:41.541
Um, what about you and Brenda?

00:41.624 --> 00:45.087
Brenda's a great woman, but she's not you.

00:46.213 --> 00:47.839
So you ended things with her?

00:47.922 --> 00:49.341
No, not yet.

00:50.717 --> 00:53.095
I didn't have much of a plan
beyond coming here.

00:54.262 --> 00:55.680
-Just had to see you.
-[chuckles]

00:55.763 --> 00:58.433
I'll go see Brenda tomorrow at the salon.

00:59.101 --> 01:03.230
Wouldn't be right for us to start anything
without talking to her first.

01:04.021 --> 01:06.483
Yeah, that's the right thing to do.

01:06.566 --> 01:10.027
Roger was too much of a coward to tell me
that he wanted to be with someone else.

01:10.112 --> 01:12.864
So I came home one day,
thinking he was on a plane to Seattle.

01:12.947 --> 01:15.408
But instead, he was on a flight attendant
in our living room.

01:15.492 --> 01:17.327
[Joanne chuckles]

01:17.410 --> 01:20.122
That was the first time
that I got to show a flight attendant

01:20.205 --> 01:21.706
where the exit was.

01:23.625 --> 01:27.712
Hard to blame him, if the only
other choice was going to Seattle.

01:27.795 --> 01:29.256
[chuckles]

01:30.132 --> 01:33.343
So, uh, after you talk to Brenda,
shall we have dinner?

01:33.426 --> 01:35.970
Sure. How about Saturday night?

01:36.929 --> 01:38.265
I'll cook for you.

01:38.348 --> 01:40.225
Only if you're cooking steak.

01:40.933 --> 01:42.727
You really are the one.

01:47.357 --> 01:51.361
[Reagan over speakers]  Mr. Gorbachev,
tear down this wall.

01:53.613 --> 01:56.199
I'm gonna go out on a limb
and guess that's your phone, Dad.

01:59.286 --> 02:00.912
Brenda. You don't wanna answer it?

02:01.621 --> 02:03.498
I don't wanna talk to her right now.

02:04.791 --> 02:06.751
You want me to talk to her?
I'll talk to her.

02:06.834 --> 02:09.962
You touch that phone, and you're gonna
pull back a fuckin' stump.

02:11.798 --> 02:15.092
What's going on?
Got a little trouble in paradise?

02:15.843 --> 02:18.138
This have anything to do
with Joanne coming back to town?

02:18.221 --> 02:21.433
[chuckles] Juggling two women, huh?

02:21.516 --> 02:22.892
Your life is like a soap opera.

02:22.975 --> 02:26.229
You know, now'd be a good time
to explain to Colt he was adopted.

02:28.105 --> 02:31.401
Why would I be the adopted one?
You're like 5'3".

02:31.484 --> 02:33.153
[both chuckle]

02:33.236 --> 02:35.363
With that beard,
you look like a fuckin' leprechaun.

02:35.447 --> 02:36.948
[Rooster chuckles]

02:38.283 --> 02:40.702
Hey, there's a car coming up the drive.

02:40.785 --> 02:43.037
Good, maybe they'll run me over.

02:45.415 --> 02:48.042
-[Rooster] Oh!
-Holy shit!

02:48.125 --> 02:50.920
-[Rooster] Hey!
-There's my three favorite guys!

02:51.003 --> 02:52.505
Oh, Colt! [grunts]

02:52.589 --> 02:55.383
-[Rooster] What's up, Mom?
-Hey, Rooster. [grunts]

02:55.467 --> 02:58.135
And Drake... Aw, you...

02:58.845 --> 03:00.555
Hey, Beau. [chuckles]

03:00.638 --> 03:02.849
Hi, Mags. What are you doing here?

03:02.932 --> 03:05.059
What do you mean? I missed you guys.

03:05.142 --> 03:06.311
Hey, what happened to your Jeep?

03:06.394 --> 03:08.813
Oh, I donated it. Yeah...

03:08.896 --> 03:12.567
It's now a bookmobile for some
underprivileged kids in Appalachia.

03:12.650 --> 03:15.695
Mostly, because it broke down
in Appalachia.

03:16.529 --> 03:18.155
-[grunts]
-Bookmobile.

03:18.240 --> 03:21.659
That's like what Batman would drive
if he was a fuckin' nerd. [chuckles]

03:23.370 --> 03:24.621
Sit down. What you been up to?

03:25.288 --> 03:27.249
Oh, let's see.

03:27.332 --> 03:30.585
Well, last week,
I was hiking in the Grand Canyon.

03:30.668 --> 03:32.504
That sounds like something I'd like to do.

03:32.587 --> 03:34.797
Yeah. I also did a sweat lodge.

03:34.881 --> 03:37.800
Just 40 women
in a small yurt for five hours,

03:37.884 --> 03:40.136
sweating and searching
for their inner truth.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.471
I'm out.

03:43.598 --> 03:48.353
I met this woman named Carol, and we went
and checked out Montezuma's Castle.

03:48.436 --> 03:50.313
It's from the Hopi tribe.

03:50.397 --> 03:53.525
And when you go in,
there's a mural on the wall,

03:53.608 --> 03:55.277
with a mother talking to her sons,

03:55.360 --> 03:58.195
and they're both on their phones,
clearly not paying attention.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.033
-That sounds awesome.
-That sounds good.

04:03.285 --> 04:05.662
All right, enough about me.
Colt, how's Abby?

04:05.745 --> 04:07.705
[scoffs] She's great.

04:07.789 --> 04:09.791
Uh, lost her job.
She's living in the house now.

04:09.874 --> 04:11.125
How's she great?

04:11.208 --> 04:13.336
It's... it's what people say, Mom.

04:14.128 --> 04:17.590
Uh, actually, she's at an interview
right now for a teacher job.

04:17.674 --> 04:20.009
Hope she gets it.
She's been smoking, like, a pack a day

04:20.092 --> 04:21.428
and crying herself to sleep.

04:22.178 --> 04:23.388
She's great.

04:25.682 --> 04:28.100
Hey, I saw some stakes out
on the property line.

04:28.184 --> 04:31.103
What are you putting in,
land mines or a moat?

04:32.021 --> 04:33.856
They're surveying the ranch.

04:33.940 --> 04:36.568
Rocky Mountain Energy
wants to put a pipeline in.

04:36.651 --> 04:40.112
What'd you say?
"No" or "Fuck, no"? [chuckles]

04:40.947 --> 04:44.534
Actually, I'm considering it.
The company's got a good track record.

04:45.785 --> 04:49.289
Oh, okay.
One of those nice oil companies.

04:49.372 --> 04:51.708
Yeah, I'm sure nothing will go wrong.

04:51.791 --> 04:55.878
When you take your cattle to market,
you can sell 'em leaded or unleaded.

04:58.089 --> 05:01.718
Maggie, you've been home for five minutes.
You really wanna do this now?

05:01.801 --> 05:06.055
You're right. I'm sorry.
I'm just glad the family's all together.

05:08.057 --> 05:10.017
-Oh, yeah, sounds great.
-Sounds awesome.

05:13.270 --> 05:15.272
[theme song playing]

06:16.959 --> 06:19.211
-[video game music playing]
-Aw, come on.

06:20.337 --> 06:21.423
[grunts]

06:21.506 --> 06:23.508
-[Colt] Hi, babe.
-Hey.

06:23.591 --> 06:24.926
All right, let me ask you something.

06:25.677 --> 06:29.472
You ever think that, uh, Super Mario
looks like a young version of my dad?

06:32.058 --> 06:34.143
[imitating Super Mario] It's me,
Beau Bennett!

06:35.853 --> 06:38.022
Why you no close the gate?

06:38.940 --> 06:41.776
-[normal] Ah.
-Yeah, that's cute.

06:42.777 --> 06:44.028
What's the matter?

06:45.738 --> 06:47.281
Ah, shit.

06:48.199 --> 06:49.325
Interview didn't go well?

06:49.408 --> 06:52.328
No, it was great.
Thirty people with master's degrees,

06:52.411 --> 06:56.583
all competing to be a seventh grade
home ec teacher slash field hockey coach.

06:58.460 --> 07:01.212
By the way, if anyone asks,
I went to the Cordon Bleu cooking school

07:01.295 --> 07:02.630
on a field hockey scholarship.

07:05.633 --> 07:07.134
Yeah, no problem.

07:07.218 --> 07:10.930
[stammers] And if anyone asks you,
I finished my community service.

07:13.766 --> 07:14.809
What's this?

07:14.892 --> 07:18.145
And to top it off, I grab this box
out of my truck and the bottom fell out.

07:18.229 --> 07:20.356
-Shit went everywhere.
-[Colt chuckles]

07:20.440 --> 07:21.983
I broke my Denver Broncos snow globe.

07:22.066 --> 07:25.277
I saved Terrell Davis,
but John Elway went down the storm drain.

07:27.154 --> 07:28.573
Don't you worry about John.

07:28.656 --> 07:29.991
I'm sure he's in the sewer right now,

07:30.074 --> 07:32.577
leading a team of rats
to a game-winning touchdown.

07:34.203 --> 07:38.500
Fuck-a-dee-doo-dah,
that's a fucking Pixar movie right there.

07:48.092 --> 07:49.844
-Gracias.
-That's not all.

07:49.927 --> 07:53.097
You know, I went to my dad's office,
he offered me a job at the dealership.

07:53.180 --> 07:54.223
Oh.

07:55.349 --> 07:56.518
Is it something you wanna do?

07:57.434 --> 07:59.646
Well, what I wanna do is be a teacher.

07:59.729 --> 08:02.439
But it would be a steady income,
and it could help pay for the wedding.

08:02.524 --> 08:03.733
It would relieve some of this stress.

08:03.816 --> 08:07.153
Plus, I look fucking great
in John Deere green.

08:09.238 --> 08:11.533
Okay. So, like, how would this work?

08:11.616 --> 08:13.450
There's still a couple months
left in the school year, right?

08:13.535 --> 08:17.079
[stammers] I mean, I honestly don't know
'cause I was always in summer school.

08:18.581 --> 08:20.792
Well... I don't know.

08:20.875 --> 08:22.459
I thought I'd try it out
for a couple weekends,

08:22.544 --> 08:24.378
and if I like it,
then I'd start in the summer.

08:24.461 --> 08:27.840
By fall, I'll either be a manager
or lose my arm in a hay baler.

08:30.092 --> 08:31.636
Either way, I'll have great medical.

08:32.887 --> 08:34.722
So, what do you think?

08:34.806 --> 08:37.684
First of all,
I think you'd look hot with a hook.

08:39.644 --> 08:40.687
[chuckles]

08:40.770 --> 08:44.148
But, you know what?
If this is something you wanna do,

08:44.231 --> 08:46.317
-I'm a 100% behind you.
-[chuckles]

08:46.400 --> 08:47.610
-I tell you one thing.
-Mmm.

08:47.694 --> 08:50.613
If I came in there to buy somethin',
I saw you there?

08:50.697 --> 08:53.282
I'd spend a lot more than I could afford
just to impress you. [chuckles]

08:53.365 --> 08:54.617
Aw.

08:55.492 --> 08:58.412
Holy shit, I think I just figured out
what's wrong with America.

09:02.584 --> 09:07.171
Hey, bro. Guess who hooked up
with Engineer Jen last night?

09:07.254 --> 09:08.297
Fuck you.

09:08.380 --> 09:11.676
[laughs] Dude, I am serious.

09:12.343 --> 09:15.805
We did it Lionel Richie-style.
All night long.

09:17.682 --> 09:20.602
Okay. Well, I hooked up
with, uh, Danica Patrick

09:20.685 --> 09:22.729
on the hood of her GoDaddy car, so...

09:23.813 --> 09:27.108
-No, dummy. I'm not kidding.
-Yeah, neither am I.

09:29.235 --> 09:31.988
Wait, are you kidding?
'Cause I'm really not kidding.

09:33.447 --> 09:35.700
-Oh, I'm telling the truth.
-So am I.

09:35.783 --> 09:37.744
Okay, so you hooked up with Engineer Jen,

09:37.827 --> 09:40.537
and I hooked up
with NASCAR driver Danica Patrick.

09:42.832 --> 09:45.960
See, when you say it like that,
I go back to not believing you.

09:51.132 --> 09:54.301
Hey, we have to take down
these bikini posters.

09:54.385 --> 09:56.012
What, are you kidding, Mom?

09:56.846 --> 09:59.556
That's a beautiful woman
wearing a stars and stripes bikini.

09:59.641 --> 10:01.893
That's not a poster, that's America!

10:03.477 --> 10:05.813
You take that down,
you're desecrating the flag.

10:07.774 --> 10:10.943
Pretty sure she desecrated it
when she made it into a thong.

10:12.486 --> 10:14.864
Nikki, what do you think of this?

10:16.616 --> 10:19.035
I'd pledge allegiance to that ass.

10:20.745 --> 10:22.997
This is who I burned my bra for. [sighs]

10:23.873 --> 10:26.167
Did... did you drop a cigarette
down your top?

10:26.250 --> 10:28.335
[chuckles] 'Cause I've done that before.

10:31.172 --> 10:34.759
It's sad how some people make it
through this world just on their looks.

10:36.969 --> 10:40.514
Hey, I was going through the books
and, well, I found this reminder,

10:40.597 --> 10:42.725
"Call Blonde Hair, Red Bra,
Annoying Laugh."

10:43.434 --> 10:44.852
Mmm!

10:44.936 --> 10:47.271
-Oh, yeah! I forgot about Annoying Laugh.
-[chuckles]

10:47.354 --> 10:49.982
[both imitating nasal laughter]

10:50.066 --> 10:52.735
Oh, man. She was hot.

10:53.653 --> 10:55.154
Fuckin' annoying laugh, though.

10:56.488 --> 10:58.490
Yeah, well, it also says on this napkin

10:58.574 --> 11:02.161
that you owe Walt Hansen $185
for fixing the dishwasher.

11:02.244 --> 11:04.205
Oh, yeah, you can forget about that.

11:04.288 --> 11:06.498
No, I gave Walt two kegs
for his birthday party.

11:06.582 --> 11:07.875
He called it even.

11:09.126 --> 11:11.295
Really, I came out ahead
because, you know,

11:11.378 --> 11:14.256
I went to that party and drank
at least 200 bucks worth of beer.

11:16.300 --> 11:17.844
Did you at least get a receipt?

11:21.973 --> 11:25.059
I got a picture of him pumping the keg
like he's jerkin off.

11:30.189 --> 11:31.398
[bell rings]

11:32.149 --> 11:33.901
[Brenda crying]

11:35.987 --> 11:37.404
Hey, Brenda.

11:37.488 --> 11:38.823
Hey, Beau.

11:39.824 --> 11:41.450
Wow, what... what you doing here?

11:43.035 --> 11:46.330
-You all right?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

11:48.540 --> 11:50.126
-You sure?
-[continues crying]

11:51.127 --> 11:54.964
I'm used to dealing with tears.
I raised Colt.

11:55.047 --> 11:56.298
[chuckles]

11:57.341 --> 11:58.509
What's wrong?

11:59.718 --> 12:01.512
It's the anniversary of Jim's death.

12:03.555 --> 12:07.101
I know it's been years,
but it just feels like yesterday.

12:08.895 --> 12:11.981
'Course. I'm sorry.

12:13.816 --> 12:16.402
It's all right,
but I have been like this all day.

12:16.485 --> 12:17.569
[sighs]

12:17.653 --> 12:20.907
I cried through Amber Martin's perm
and Kim Dunbar's highlights,

12:20.990 --> 12:23.159
a little boy's first haircut.

12:23.242 --> 12:26.703
But he was crying, too, so we got
through that one together. [chuckles]

12:28.372 --> 12:29.791
Well, that's understandable.

12:31.125 --> 12:33.544
I'll tell you the same thing
I told you back then.

12:34.461 --> 12:36.088
It's all right to be sad.

12:37.298 --> 12:38.465
It's okay to miss Jim.

12:39.758 --> 12:41.844
And what'd he do with his Broncos tickets?

12:41.928 --> 12:43.220
[chuckles]

12:44.430 --> 12:47.058
Oh, thank you
for cheering me up. [chuckles]

12:47.141 --> 12:50.519
[sniffles] Mmm. I'm lucky to have you.

12:54.941 --> 12:56.025
What brings you by?

12:56.984 --> 12:58.069
Oh, right.

12:58.986 --> 13:01.322
Well, I stopped by to talk to you about...

13:03.782 --> 13:06.368
getting some shampoo for Colt.

13:07.536 --> 13:09.788
Wow, so soon? [chuckles]

13:09.872 --> 13:14.793
Good grief, is he one of those idiots
that actually rinse and repeats?

13:14.877 --> 13:17.546
Here you go. This is what he uses.

13:20.632 --> 13:23.469
$18? What the hell is in this?

13:23.552 --> 13:26.138
Shea butter, lemongrass and milk thistle.

13:26.222 --> 13:28.224
I think I'll just pick up
some dog shampoo.

13:28.307 --> 13:30.059
[laughs]

13:35.689 --> 13:36.732
What's all that?

13:36.815 --> 13:39.276
Oh, I just stopped by my house
and picked up some mail.

13:40.069 --> 13:43.322
Are those bills? You don't live there
anymore, you ain't gotta pay those.

13:45.950 --> 13:48.870
I'm terrified of the day
when we have to check your credit score.

13:48.953 --> 13:52.539
[chuckles] All right, sell me a tractor.

13:52.623 --> 13:54.333
No, Colt. I'm not in the mood.

13:54.416 --> 13:57.628
-What? No. I'm not Colt, I'm Ted.
-Oh, God.

13:58.629 --> 14:01.673
Ted... Tractor Buyer.

14:04.176 --> 14:06.512
You see?
This is why we don't role play in bed.

14:06.595 --> 14:08.847
Last week you were Ted Sex Haver.

14:11.808 --> 14:13.519
-It's like...
-[chuckles]

14:13.602 --> 14:15.187
Oh, my God.

14:16.063 --> 14:19.025
-What?
-Oh, it's just a card from my students.

14:19.775 --> 14:22.444
They found out that they're
changing schools, I'm not going with them.

14:22.528 --> 14:24.696
"Dear Miss Phillips, I'm gonna miss you."

14:24.780 --> 14:28.200
-"Miss Phillips, you made history fun."
-Hmm.

14:28.284 --> 14:30.577
"Miss Phillips, I have to take this class
again next year.

14:30.661 --> 14:33.122
It's gonna suck not getting
to look at your boobs."

14:36.250 --> 14:37.501
What the fuck?

14:37.584 --> 14:40.212
[scoffs] It's just Lucas.
He's looking for attention.

14:40.296 --> 14:41.630
Yeah, well, he got it!

14:43.090 --> 14:46.052
"Miss Phillips, I love you so much.

14:46.135 --> 14:48.888
If you weren't there for me
when my mom got sick..."

14:49.680 --> 14:50.890
[sighs]

14:53.434 --> 14:54.435
[sighs]

14:56.228 --> 14:59.315
-"I don't know what I would have done."
-[chuckles]

15:00.149 --> 15:01.943
"You're an inspiration to me."

15:02.026 --> 15:03.945
Yeah, well,
I don't feel like an inspiration.

15:04.736 --> 15:06.613
I feel like a fucking failure.

15:08.615 --> 15:10.034
[scoffs]

15:10.952 --> 15:14.288
I just wish I could go back a year,
when things were so much easier.

15:15.622 --> 15:18.960
Okay, let's think about this differently.

15:19.043 --> 15:22.004
Now, a year ago,
you didn't have all of this.

15:25.882 --> 15:26.926
Yeah, but...

15:27.468 --> 15:32.306
you know, I had a future, and a house,
and a wedding I could afford.

15:32.389 --> 15:34.976
I wasn't always fighting
with my parents all the time.

15:37.353 --> 15:38.687
So, what are you saying?

15:39.563 --> 15:41.565
Your life was better before I come back?

15:41.648 --> 15:44.235
No, I'm not saying that. It's... But...

15:44.318 --> 15:45.945
Ugh, it doesn't matter.

15:46.653 --> 15:48.072
Yeah, well, it matters to me.

15:50.992 --> 15:53.535
I'm pretty sure I didn't have nothing
to do with Garrison closing down.

15:53.619 --> 15:55.246
I'm... I'm pretty sure
I didn't have nothing to do

15:55.329 --> 15:57.539
with you losing your job or your house.

15:57.623 --> 16:00.334
-Colt, I'm not blaming you.
-No, you're not blaming me.

16:00.417 --> 16:04.171
You're just saying you wanna go back
to a life where I wasn't in it.

16:04.255 --> 16:06.340
Okay, great. Yeah, everything is great.

16:06.423 --> 16:08.009
I'm a 34-year-old woman,

16:08.092 --> 16:10.469
living in my boyfriend's
childhood bedroom.

16:10.552 --> 16:13.680
I haven't even been here a week,
and I've already, three different times,

16:13.764 --> 16:17.268
walked in on your dad while he was
cleaning a gun in his underwear.

16:20.437 --> 16:22.023
So that's the way it's gonna be?

16:23.357 --> 16:24.400
What does that mean?

16:24.483 --> 16:29.196
It means if you're so miserable
not teaching, then go on and teach.

16:29.280 --> 16:31.740
What? Why didn't I think of that?

16:32.866 --> 16:34.160
I should just teach.

16:34.243 --> 16:37.246
Oh, wait, that's right, I tried.
There's nothing out there.

16:37.329 --> 16:42.959
Abby... I played football for 15 years.

16:43.627 --> 16:46.005
I played for 23 different teams,

16:46.088 --> 16:48.549
and that ain't including the ones
I didn't make.

16:48.632 --> 16:51.135
You went on one job interview,

16:51.218 --> 16:53.470
and you're gonna... you're gonna give up,
you're gonna quit?

16:53.554 --> 16:54.555
That's fuckin' pathetic.

16:54.638 --> 16:56.598
Oh, so now I'm pathetic? Okay. Great.

16:56.682 --> 16:58.350
Thank you for all of your help.

16:58.434 --> 17:00.644
Oh, oh, there you go,
there you go, just give up.

17:00.727 --> 17:04.898
Yeah. Is that the advice
that you give to... to Erin or Lucy or...

17:05.691 --> 17:08.277
Did fucking Lucas draw boobs?

17:11.780 --> 17:13.199
[sighs]

17:13.324 --> 17:16.743
Hey, Rooster, I'm heading out.
Can I get an advance for next week?

17:17.828 --> 17:19.038
Uh, yeah, sure.

17:19.121 --> 17:21.748
Can I get an advance for my next beer?

17:25.336 --> 17:26.545
All right. [sighs]

17:26.628 --> 17:29.673
Thanks. See you. Bye, Mrs. Rooster.

17:29.756 --> 17:30.882
It's Maggie.

17:31.925 --> 17:33.719
And it's on the sign!

17:34.845 --> 17:36.805
What... Do you always pay her in cash?

17:36.888 --> 17:38.765
Huh? Oh, no, not always.

17:38.849 --> 17:40.892
Last week,
I had 200 bucks on a scratch-off,

17:40.976 --> 17:42.269
so I just gave her that.

17:43.479 --> 17:44.855
What if she gets audited?

17:44.938 --> 17:48.109
How's she gonna explain all those
deposits into her bank account?

17:48.192 --> 17:49.901
Mom, that's crazy.

17:49.985 --> 17:51.778
Nikki doesn't have a bank account.

17:54.156 --> 17:57.784
You can't pay employees
under the table, you know?

17:57.868 --> 18:00.579
If you don't pay taxes,
they can't get health insurance.

18:00.662 --> 18:03.957
And judging from how she dresses,
she's gonna get a few colds.

18:05.792 --> 18:08.170
It's just not ethical
to do business this way.

18:08.254 --> 18:10.589
Yeah, well,
is it ethical I tell people that

18:10.672 --> 18:12.841
Carrie Underwood might show up here
for karaoke night?

18:14.718 --> 18:16.553
No, but it's good for business.

18:16.637 --> 18:17.888
Last week, we were so packed,

18:17.971 --> 18:19.890
they had to take down
the fire capacity sign.

18:21.683 --> 18:23.269
Not just about making money.

18:23.352 --> 18:25.562
I mean, you gotta do things the right way.

18:25.646 --> 18:30.025
For instance, there's three whole days
where there's absolutely no receipts.

18:30.109 --> 18:31.152
Right. [sighs]

18:31.235 --> 18:34.405
Well, those are the three nights
we got shut down.

18:34.488 --> 18:36.198
What do you mean, "shut down"?

18:36.282 --> 18:38.284
Look, it was a bullshit trap, okay?

18:38.367 --> 18:40.661
They sent in this hot girl
to come in here and flirt with me.

18:40.744 --> 18:43.164
So we're flirting,
I end up giving her a beer.

18:44.080 --> 18:45.207
Turns out she's underage.

18:45.291 --> 18:48.084
Oh, you got a citation
for serving a minor?

18:48.169 --> 18:50.254
How is this the first time
I'm hearing about this?

18:50.337 --> 18:52.088
Because I took care of everything.

18:52.173 --> 18:53.799
And it ended up
not being that big of a deal.

18:53.882 --> 18:57.803
No, I'm the judge of what's a big deal.
And guess what? It's a big fucking deal!

18:58.929 --> 19:00.847
I'm gonna go sit over there.

19:04.518 --> 19:07.688
This place is important
to a lot of people in this town.

19:07.771 --> 19:08.939
Especially me.

19:09.022 --> 19:11.817
All I asked you to do
was take care of it while I was gone.

19:11.900 --> 19:14.320
Yeah, and I've done that.

19:14.403 --> 19:17.406
And by the way, you didn't ask me, okay?
I volunteered to help.

19:17.489 --> 19:18.657
Yeah, well, you wanna help?

19:18.740 --> 19:20.992
Stop fucking around
before we get shut down.

19:22.203 --> 19:24.621
You know what?
You don't like the way I do things?

19:24.705 --> 19:26.790
Fine. Do it yourself, Dad!

19:37.718 --> 19:38.844
Hey, Joanne.

19:38.927 --> 19:41.430
Hey, Beau. Brought you a present.

19:42.806 --> 19:44.183
Four Roses.

19:45.226 --> 19:47.769
-That's what I brought you.
-It's the same bottle.

19:47.853 --> 19:49.355
[both chuckle]

19:49.438 --> 19:52.107
I never got the chance to open it
before I left for Phoenix.

19:52.858 --> 19:56.653
And you don't wanna take whiskey
when you go visit your daughter in rehab.

19:58.655 --> 19:59.906
I know.

19:59.990 --> 20:02.868
I gotta keep booze away from my kids, too.

20:02.951 --> 20:05.246
They're like fucking truffle pigs for it.

20:08.290 --> 20:12.961
So, listen. I was gonna call you,
but I wanted to tell you this in person.

20:13.920 --> 20:15.381
This doesn't sound good.

20:16.215 --> 20:18.800
-I didn't end it with Brenda.
-What?

20:18.884 --> 20:21.845
It was the anniversary
of her husband's death.

20:21.928 --> 20:24.598
Oh. I'm... I'm so sorry.

20:24.681 --> 20:26.683
-Yeah.
-[sighs]

20:26.767 --> 20:28.101
She was pretty upset.

20:28.977 --> 20:30.396
I'll go talk to her tomorrow.

20:31.730 --> 20:35.526
Delaying the cow to slaughter
doesn't make it any easier on the cow.

20:35.609 --> 20:37.861
[chuckles] Okay,
maybe I should talk to her.

20:39.363 --> 20:44.701
I was gonna talk to her today,
but I wanted to give her some time.

20:46.036 --> 20:47.788
Well, you're a good man, Beau.

20:49.540 --> 20:52.709
-I should probably head out though.
-Yeah, maybe you're right.

20:54.420 --> 20:56.255
Is it bad if I want you to stay?

20:56.880 --> 20:58.424
You want me to stay or the whiskey?

20:59.258 --> 21:00.801
Is it bad if it's both?

21:00.884 --> 21:02.135
[clears throat]

21:02.218 --> 21:03.720
If the whiskey stays, I stay.

21:03.804 --> 21:05.306
-Good.
-[chuckles]

21:06.348 --> 21:10.101
So, how was your day?
What's new at the Cracker Barrel?

21:10.185 --> 21:14.147
Well, 29 days ago,
a customer left the cutest sweater.

21:14.230 --> 21:16.608
So in two days, that baby's mine.

21:16.692 --> 21:18.109
[knocking on door]

21:24.115 --> 21:25.701
-Brenda.
-Hey, Beau.

21:25.784 --> 21:26.952
Hey...

21:27.035 --> 21:28.620
Oh, hey, Joanne.

21:28.704 --> 21:32.123
-Hey, Brenda. It's been a while.
-Yeah, it has.

21:34.918 --> 21:38.464
Uh, I wanted to thank you
for coming by the other day,

21:38.547 --> 21:40.507
but I didn't know that you two
were getting together.

21:40.591 --> 21:43.051
Oh, she just stopped by. We were, uh...

21:44.803 --> 21:48.014
just talking about
the dangers of alcoholism.

21:49.891 --> 21:52.268
I'm sorry, I'm being rude.
Can I get you a drink?

21:54.270 --> 21:57.649
Uh, no, I don't want to interrupt,
so I'm... I'm just gonna get going.

21:57.733 --> 21:59.651
No, no. I'm... I'm gonna go.

21:59.735 --> 22:01.862
Beau and I can catch up another time.

22:01.945 --> 22:05.407
-It was nice to see you again.
-Yeah. You, too.

22:12.581 --> 22:15.417
So, what? [chuckles]

22:15.501 --> 22:19.838
Just another friendly dinner with Joanne?
What is going on?

22:21.131 --> 22:22.341
I'm so sorry.

22:24.801 --> 22:28.930
I stopped by the salon yesterday
to talk to you.

22:31.392 --> 22:35.186
But... it was pretty clear
it was the wrong time.

22:38.690 --> 22:39.816
Oh...

22:41.610 --> 22:42.986
Wow.

22:43.069 --> 22:48.033
You didn't break up with me
while I was crying over my dead husband.

22:49.493 --> 22:50.702
What a gentleman.

22:51.578 --> 22:53.705
This isn't what I intended.

22:53.789 --> 22:55.499
None of it is.

22:56.625 --> 22:57.834
Brenda, wait a minute.

22:57.918 --> 23:00.629
When I said I was...
Things were done with Joanne,

23:00.712 --> 23:02.923
I... I thought they were.

23:04.508 --> 23:06.009
I never wanted to hurt you.

23:06.092 --> 23:09.262
Guess I'm just gonna have to
take your word for it.

23:10.431 --> 23:12.516
Wonder why
I'm having such trouble doing that.

23:21.442 --> 23:23.193
Yeah, hey, is this Lucas?

23:25.278 --> 23:28.490
What do you mean, "Who's this?"
It's your worst fuckin' nightmare.

23:30.659 --> 23:33.244
Hey, I'll call you back. Hey, babe.

23:33.328 --> 23:34.538
Hey.

23:34.621 --> 23:37.248
Hey, uh, listen.

23:38.291 --> 23:40.877
I want to apologize. I, uh...

23:42.128 --> 23:45.799
I... I went off on you, and I just...

23:45.882 --> 23:49.177
I wanna be the person that
you can count on when things get crazy,

23:49.260 --> 23:51.680
not the person who makes it worse.

23:53.389 --> 23:55.433
No, I should apologize.

23:55.517 --> 23:59.104
I never wanna go back to a time
where you're not in my life. [chuckles]

23:59.187 --> 24:01.439
-I knew you didn't mean it.
-[both chuckle]

24:01.523 --> 24:02.941
-I mean, how could you?
-Well.

24:03.734 --> 24:06.444
But you were right,
I needed a kick in the ass.

24:06.528 --> 24:09.531
Wait. Oh, so yelling at you was good?

24:09.615 --> 24:13.201
Like, my dad's been right all along?
Like, screaming at people helps?

24:13.284 --> 24:16.287
[chuckles] I spent the whole day
sending out e-mails to a ton of schools,

24:16.371 --> 24:18.373
and getting in touch with every teacher
I've ever worked with.

24:18.456 --> 24:19.833
I did everything I could think of.

24:19.916 --> 24:22.210
You know those e-mails that say,
"Come back to LinkedIn"?

24:22.293 --> 24:23.837
Well, I did. I came back!

24:25.296 --> 24:27.173
I am not gonna give up that easily.

24:27.257 --> 24:31.177
[chuckles] Yeah! That's...
Babe, that is so great.

24:31.261 --> 24:33.429
I'm gonna yell at you all the time,
you crazy bitch!

24:38.184 --> 24:42.063
-Colt, what the fuck? No.
-I'm sorry. I was just trying it out. I...

24:43.023 --> 24:45.651
All right, I'm gonna go get changed,
and then we can grab some dinner.

24:45.734 --> 24:47.819
Okay. [chuckles]
Applebee's?

24:47.903 --> 24:49.571
No, you fucking asshole.

25:07.088 --> 25:12.010
Uh-oh. You're fixing the chair.
What's wrong?

25:12.093 --> 25:14.930
Nothing. It was wobbly.

25:15.013 --> 25:19.059
Ah, no. We were married for 40 years.

25:19.142 --> 25:22.938
Whenever stuff goes wrong in your life,
you start fixing things.

25:24.522 --> 25:27.609
The drought of '72,
you fixed all the hinges in the barn.

25:29.444 --> 25:32.363
Let's see. When your mom died,
you replaced the engine in the truck.

25:32.447 --> 25:36.618
And we never would have had new cabinets
if Reagan hadn't been shot.

25:39.621 --> 25:40.622
[tool clatters]

25:41.247 --> 25:44.375
After you left, I started dating Brenda.

25:45.752 --> 25:48.171
Well, all right.

25:48.254 --> 25:50.882
Well, look, I know I had issues
with her in the past,

25:50.966 --> 25:54.469
but I've made peace with that.
So, I'm happy for you both.

25:54.552 --> 25:56.471
And then I kissed Joanne.

25:56.554 --> 25:58.431
Ha, ha! Fuck you, Brenda!

26:03.561 --> 26:06.064
I'm glad one of us is enjoying this.

26:07.691 --> 26:09.651
Look, if it makes you feel any better,

26:09.735 --> 26:12.779
it hasn't been
all sunshine and roses for me, either.

26:12.863 --> 26:16.324
-Clint and I broke up.
-Ha, ha! Fuck you, Clint!

26:19.703 --> 26:22.873
What happened? The other night,
you said everything was great.

26:22.956 --> 26:26.752
Oh, I didn't wanna talk about my love life
in front of the boys.

26:27.628 --> 26:29.713
That's why we had two of 'em, Maggie.

26:29.796 --> 26:32.716
So they'd leave us alone
and talk to each other.

26:34.801 --> 26:38.013
Hey, do you know what's going on
with Rooster over at the bar?

26:38.096 --> 26:41.016
I know he lied to me
about meeting Carrie Underwood.

26:43.351 --> 26:45.520
He had the place shut down for three days.

26:45.603 --> 26:47.856
And when I got pissed off,
he didn't take responsibility.

26:47.939 --> 26:50.025
He just said I was acting like you.

26:50.108 --> 26:53.403
What, that you were hardworking
and handsome?

26:54.988 --> 26:59.325
If Rooster doesn't want me yelling at him,
he shouldn't keep fuckin' up.

26:59.409 --> 27:02.453
That definitely sounds like
something I'd say.

27:03.997 --> 27:05.707
You know, when it came to the ranch,

27:05.791 --> 27:07.751
I always thought
you were a little tough on the guys.

27:07.834 --> 27:09.085
But now I get it.

27:09.169 --> 27:12.505
I mean, you were just protecting
something that you built.

27:12.588 --> 27:16.134
Listen, Rooster screwed up,
but he handled it.

27:16.217 --> 27:17.969
He's always been this way.

27:19.095 --> 27:21.765
He may be the guy
that set the bar on fire,

27:21.848 --> 27:24.600
but he's also the guy
that would run in to save everybody.

27:25.977 --> 27:29.731
And then he'd come running out
with his fuckin' leprechaun hair on fire.

27:36.446 --> 27:37.447
Hey.

27:38.406 --> 27:39.407
Hey.

27:41.117 --> 27:42.744
I thought you'd be here.

27:43.661 --> 27:45.914
Yeah, well,
bar ain't gonna fuck itself up.

27:47.582 --> 27:50.668
Look, Rooster, I'm sorry about last night.

27:50.752 --> 27:54.172
If it weren't for you, I never would've
been able to leave Garrison.

27:54.255 --> 27:56.424
I had great experiences.

27:56.507 --> 27:58.134
I made a difference.

27:58.218 --> 28:00.887
I saved those baby turtles
in North Carolina

28:00.971 --> 28:04.640
and I went skinny-dipping
in the Gulf of Mexico. [chuckles]

28:04.725 --> 28:07.685
-Mom.
-Oh, grow up. You came out of me.

28:08.812 --> 28:13.441
Look, I had the best three months
of my life, and I owe it all to you.

28:15.736 --> 28:18.613
Well, I was happy to do it.

28:19.447 --> 28:21.699
And, you know, it's like the Bible says...

28:21.783 --> 28:24.995
"Providing for your family,
the most badass fucking thing you can do."

28:25.078 --> 28:26.079
[chuckles]

28:26.997 --> 28:31.376
Well, thank you. And I love you.
And you're fired.

28:36.882 --> 28:38.925
-Hey, babe.
-Hey! Guess what?

28:39.009 --> 28:41.762
I just got an e-mail. I got an interview.

28:42.678 --> 28:44.222
-That's amazing!
-Yeah!

28:44.305 --> 28:47.308
All right, what college did you go to,
and what sport do you gotta learn?

28:47.392 --> 28:49.978
[chuckles] No,
it's a history teaching job.

28:50.061 --> 28:51.897
-And I don't have to lie at all.
-Oh!

28:51.980 --> 28:54.399
But, um, you might.

28:54.482 --> 28:57.318
'Cause I put you down
as my ex-principal. [chuckles]

28:58.862 --> 29:03.283
If they ask, I am a conscientious
and exemplary educator.

29:03.366 --> 29:05.911
-[chuckles]
-I'll write it down.

29:06.787 --> 29:07.788
Oh, no, I got this.

29:07.871 --> 29:11.082
Oh, by the way, I came up with the title
for that John Elway rat movie.

29:11.166 --> 29:12.918
Sewer Bowl Champions.

29:15.879 --> 29:17.130
Yeah, I'll write it down.

29:18.173 --> 29:20.466
Listen, um, there's just one catch.

29:21.217 --> 29:23.344
Oh, my God. Is fucking Lucas going there?

29:23.428 --> 29:25.806
[chuckles] No.

29:26.681 --> 29:27.891
The job is in Denver.

29:29.184 --> 29:33.063
-Denver...
-Yeah. I'd have to move there.

29:34.272 --> 29:37.442
-Where in the hell is the solvent?
-[Abby clears throat]

29:45.241 --> 29:47.243
