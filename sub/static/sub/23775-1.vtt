00:42.823 --> 00:45.290
Booyah!

00:45.292 --> 00:47.195
<i>Half man, half machine.</i>

00:47.762 --> 00:49.560
All awesome.

00:49.562 --> 00:51.397
I'm like a ninja
meets an acrobat.

00:51.399 --> 00:52.630
I'm a ninjabat!

00:52.632 --> 00:54.199
Maybe I'm in the bat family.

00:54.201 --> 00:55.967
Dreams do come true.

00:55.969 --> 00:57.202
I am so...

01:02.009 --> 01:03.311
Amazing.

01:06.580 --> 01:07.582
Huh?

01:22.496 --> 01:24.196
Couldn't let me have it,
could you?

01:24.198 --> 01:27.464
And your tour of the Hall
of Justice concludes here.

01:27.466 --> 01:28.899
In our specially designed

01:28.901 --> 01:31.170
state-of-the-art
training facility.

01:31.172 --> 01:32.971
Atom, meet Cyborg.

01:32.973 --> 01:34.640
Cyber mechanical specialist

01:34.642 --> 01:37.509
and the League's
little ray of sunshine.

01:37.511 --> 01:39.310
Hey, Atom.

01:39.312 --> 01:41.747
Ah, <i>Canis lupus familiaris.</i>

01:41.749 --> 01:45.349
It's a common hypothesis
that dog is man's best friend.

01:46.619 --> 01:48.990
But, uh... Not mine.

01:49.990 --> 01:52.390
Whoa, cool! Oh...

01:52.392 --> 01:55.961
"The Atom."
I see what you did there

01:55.963 --> 01:58.896
<i>with your name and you shrinking
down all tiny and stuff.</i>

01:58.898 --> 02:00.265
Relax, Atom.

02:00.267 --> 02:02.232
This is Ace, the Bat-Hound.

02:02.234 --> 02:04.836
He's just evaluating you.

02:04.838 --> 02:07.604
Well, in my
scientific evaluation,

02:07.606 --> 02:09.875
Ace is very intimidating.

02:09.877 --> 02:10.877
Tell me about it.

02:13.347 --> 02:15.180
Lesson one with animals.

02:15.182 --> 02:17.482
Never show weakness.

02:17.484 --> 02:20.418
Man, I think I need
an oil change.

02:20.420 --> 02:23.155
Batman, I didn't know
you had a...

02:23.157 --> 02:24.722
Uh... Super-Pet.

02:24.724 --> 02:27.692
Ace the Bat-Hound
is more than a pet.

02:27.694 --> 02:28.859
He's the best sidekick

02:28.861 --> 02:31.096
a caped crusader
could ever have.

02:31.098 --> 02:33.063
What about Robin?

02:33.065 --> 02:36.535
Aren't you the best sidekick?
Yes, you are, yes you are.

02:36.537 --> 02:39.103
Aw, I want a Bat belly rub.

02:39.105 --> 02:40.672
So, Atom.

02:40.674 --> 02:43.508
Now that you've seen
the Hall of Justice...

02:43.510 --> 02:45.244
What do you think?

02:45.246 --> 02:47.578
Would you like to become a
member of the Justice League?

02:47.580 --> 02:50.049
I...

02:50.051 --> 02:51.448
Hold your diminutive answer.

02:51.450 --> 02:52.787
Follow me.

02:53.986 --> 02:56.454
Come on, Plas,
it's the trouble alert.

02:56.456 --> 02:58.823
But I'm starving.
I need a pick-me-up.

02:58.825 --> 03:00.959
How's this for a pick-me-up?

03:00.961 --> 03:04.896
One order of fast food to give you a boost.

03:04.898 --> 03:06.998
Huh? What? Hey!

03:08.669 --> 03:11.105
Way to be
a team motivator, Firestorm.

03:15.609 --> 03:18.143
Let's see
who needs our help today.

03:18.145 --> 03:20.545
<i>This is Lois Lane
with</i> Breaking News.

03:20.547 --> 03:22.180
Gotham City's
clown prince of crime,

03:22.182 --> 03:24.884
the Joker, has invaded our beloved city.

03:25.885 --> 03:27.686
Ah.

03:27.688 --> 03:29.520
Sunny Metropolis.

03:29.522 --> 03:33.157
The perfect getaway
from Gotham's Dark Knight.

03:33.159 --> 03:35.227
Nothing like a little vacation

03:35.229 --> 03:37.929
to put the pep
back in my step.

03:54.414 --> 03:55.513
<i>Oh, my!</i>

03:55.515 --> 03:57.715
<i>The Joker's gassing the city.</i>

03:57.717 --> 04:01.620
<i>Who can
stop this ruinous jester?</i>

04:01.622 --> 04:05.123
<i>Help us!
Justice League, Superman.</i>

04:05.125 --> 04:06.323
<i>Save us!</i>

04:09.462 --> 04:12.030
Great Scott!
Lois is in trouble.

04:12.032 --> 04:13.131
Again.

04:13.133 --> 04:16.434
All right, team,
gear up and let's go.

04:16.435 --> 04:17.902
Atom, this is your chance

04:17.904 --> 04:19.803
to join
the Justice League in action.

04:19.805 --> 04:21.873
- Are you ready?
- I, uh...

04:21.875 --> 04:23.006
No pressure.

04:23.008 --> 04:24.475
We know you're new
at being a superhero.

04:24.477 --> 04:25.777
If you want, you can stay here

04:25.779 --> 04:27.212
and hang out
with Ace and Krypto.

04:27.214 --> 04:28.481
Krypto?

04:30.116 --> 04:31.950
Another Super-Pet?

04:31.952 --> 04:34.652
Yeah, I'll take
the clown over the canine.

04:34.654 --> 04:36.957
The sooner, the better.

04:43.897 --> 04:47.198
Ooh, the <i>Daily Planet</i>
news building.

04:47.200 --> 04:49.600
<i>Hmm, the visitors'
guide calls it</i>

04:49.602 --> 04:52.672
"The jewel
of the Metropolis skyline."

04:53.440 --> 04:55.573
Meh. Kinda boring.

04:55.575 --> 04:57.575
Let's renovate!

05:02.549 --> 05:04.515
<i>The nerve of that clown.</i>

05:04.517 --> 05:08.419
He's tromping all over the jewel
of the Metropolis skyline.

05:08.421 --> 05:10.087
And he's jaywalking.

05:10.089 --> 05:11.789
Let's take him down.

05:15.594 --> 05:17.862
The welcoming committee.
For me?

05:17.864 --> 05:19.797
Good thing I brought pastry.

05:24.904 --> 05:26.537
Ooh, is that coconut cream?

05:26.539 --> 05:27.972
Lemon meringue.

05:27.974 --> 05:29.243
<i>With a bang.</i>

05:30.878 --> 05:34.214
Brace for impact!

05:37.150 --> 05:40.753
What a beautiful, perfectly
safe day at the park.

05:48.496 --> 05:50.929
- I should've taken my jet.
- Ooh. Ooh.

05:50.931 --> 05:52.664
I'm holding it together.

05:52.666 --> 05:54.568
I'm holding it together.

05:55.769 --> 05:57.535
Oh, this is embarrassing.

06:00.007 --> 06:03.008
It's not that funny.
A little consideration here.

06:03.010 --> 06:04.042
Lois, Cyborg.

06:04.044 --> 06:07.177
Try to stay calm!

06:07.179 --> 06:10.583
I can still hear you.

06:14.354 --> 06:16.054
Is this normally how it goes?

06:16.056 --> 06:18.823
Yeah, but usually with
a little less laughter.

06:18.825 --> 06:20.525
That laughter is dangerous.

06:20.527 --> 06:21.825
We've gotta
help these people

06:21.827 --> 06:23.426
before they laugh
themselves to death.

06:23.428 --> 06:26.530
And stop the Joker before
he endangers anyone else.

06:26.532 --> 06:28.032
Then let's divide and conquer.

06:28.034 --> 06:30.936
Yup, we'll have this mess
cleaned up in a flash.

06:30.938 --> 06:33.071
Speaking of,
where is the Flash?

06:33.073 --> 06:35.407
I sent out the Justice alert
minutes ago.

06:35.409 --> 06:36.808
Priority one.

06:36.810 --> 06:40.147
Barry knows
how I feel about tardiness.

06:47.654 --> 06:49.554
Come on, Barry. Get up.

06:51.291 --> 06:53.323
And one...

06:53.325 --> 06:55.626
And 2,000.

06:55.628 --> 06:56.794
Okay, I'm up.

06:56.796 --> 06:58.362
Shower time.

07:00.500 --> 07:03.660
Whoa, I have got to remember to wait for
the water to warm up before jumping in.

07:05.438 --> 07:07.873
Nice.

07:07.875 --> 07:11.245
All right, Central City,
let's get this party started.

07:13.046 --> 07:14.912
Hey, hey, hey, you hit my car!

07:14.914 --> 07:17.515
- Who's gonna take care of this?
- Me? You hit me.

07:17.517 --> 07:20.320
I'm gonna sue you
for every brick you've got.

07:21.955 --> 07:23.321
Thanks, Flash!

07:23.323 --> 07:24.856
That guy's Flash.

07:24.858 --> 07:27.292
Hidey ho, birdies.

07:27.294 --> 07:29.861
<i>Ooh, watch your step.
Good morning, Troop 52.</i>

07:29.863 --> 07:31.630
<i>Hello, hot dog.</i>

07:31.632 --> 07:34.799
- No school.
- No way. No school?

07:34.801 --> 07:36.868
Whoa! Thanks, Flash!

07:36.870 --> 07:38.770
Thanks, Flash.

07:38.772 --> 07:40.272
<i>- Thanks, Flash!
- Thanks, Flash!</i>

07:40.274 --> 07:42.340
<i>- Thanks, Flash!
- Thanks, Flash!</i>

07:45.546 --> 07:47.811
Whoa!

07:47.813 --> 07:49.746
Thanks, Flash!

07:49.748 --> 07:51.015
Five minutes out of bed

07:51.017 --> 07:52.583
and look at all
the good I've done.

07:52.585 --> 07:54.219
Time to get to Metropolis

07:54.221 --> 07:55.352
to meet up with the Justice...

07:55.354 --> 07:56.453
Oh, I know that grumble.

07:56.455 --> 07:58.623
And it's saying,
"Donuts, now!"

07:58.625 --> 08:00.659
And where are the best donuts?

08:00.661 --> 08:01.962
Gotham City.

08:06.700 --> 08:09.400
All the victims
are safely evacuated.

08:11.537 --> 08:12.770
Plastic Man,

08:12.772 --> 08:14.506
were you infected
by Joker's gas?

08:14.508 --> 08:17.710
No, it's all this laughing.
It's hilarious.

08:20.246 --> 08:21.612
Help me!

08:23.916 --> 08:25.282
Plas, get serious,

08:25.284 --> 08:27.451
we have to find a cure
for these civilians.

08:27.453 --> 08:30.922
I wonder if I can alter the
molecular structure of Joker's gas

08:30.924 --> 08:32.023
to create a cure.

08:32.025 --> 08:33.660
- How?
- Wait here.

08:34.794 --> 08:36.096
Okay.

08:40.732 --> 08:42.265
Hypothesis.

08:42.268 --> 08:44.335
At this size I should be able
to find trace elements

08:44.337 --> 08:47.537
of Joker's gas still wafting
around the area.

08:47.539 --> 08:49.040
Aha!

08:49.042 --> 08:51.109
A Joker gas molecule.

08:51.111 --> 08:53.177
There's nothing funny
about this.

08:53.179 --> 08:55.381
Now for a little experiment.

08:58.419 --> 09:01.018
- There he is.
- I've got this clown.

09:01.020 --> 09:03.653
Never underestimate
the Joker, Firestorm.

09:03.655 --> 09:06.090
I'll fly around behind him
and then we'll take him by...

09:06.092 --> 09:07.425
Huh?

09:07.427 --> 09:08.462
Surprise?

09:12.899 --> 09:14.532
Not cool, man.

09:14.534 --> 09:18.268
Batman will never
let me live this down.

09:18.270 --> 09:22.572
Whoo hoos always bring a smile to my face.

09:24.510 --> 09:26.811
You've got to be
faster than that

09:26.813 --> 09:29.082
to sneak up on the Joker.

09:31.584 --> 09:33.786
Where is Flash?

09:39.092 --> 09:40.825
It's the Flash!

09:40.827 --> 09:43.130
Best donut ever.

09:45.131 --> 09:46.696
Saved the donut.

09:46.698 --> 09:49.401
But who's gonna save you?

09:49.403 --> 09:50.801
<i>Captain Cold?</i>

09:50.803 --> 09:53.805
The only frosting I'm interested
in today is on this donut.

09:53.807 --> 09:55.005
Give up now
and we'll chalk it up

09:55.007 --> 09:57.240
to hysteria
over global warming.

09:58.477 --> 10:01.948
Instead, let's chalk it up
to global freezing.

10:03.283 --> 10:06.216
"Global freezing"?
That doesn't even make sense.

10:06.218 --> 10:09.019
Come on, Cold, you got
better material than that.

10:09.021 --> 10:12.225
How about, "Chances of that
are below zero?"

10:13.058 --> 10:15.359
Ah, never mind.

10:15.361 --> 10:17.896
I can see
my puns leave you cold.

10:17.898 --> 10:19.696
Cold.

10:19.698 --> 10:20.898
He's all yours, Officer.

10:20.900 --> 10:22.899
Now it's off to Metropolis.

10:22.901 --> 10:24.335
Thanks, Flash!

10:24.337 --> 10:25.936
Hey, you know what goes good
with those donuts?

10:25.938 --> 10:27.171
You ever been to that

10:27.173 --> 10:29.273
Lampert's Milkshakes
in Star City?

10:29.275 --> 10:31.209
No.

10:35.848 --> 10:38.017
Ready, aim...

10:38.651 --> 10:40.052
Fire!

10:44.091 --> 10:45.790
These roboclowns are quick.

10:47.827 --> 10:49.893
Whenever I visit the city,

10:49.895 --> 10:53.230
I just love
to take in a good show.

10:53.232 --> 10:55.832
Then you're gonna
love my performance as

10:55.834 --> 10:57.534
a helicopter.

11:04.977 --> 11:06.545
Well done, Plas.

11:06.547 --> 11:09.946
Bravo! Wonderful performances.

11:09.948 --> 11:12.417
I laughed, I cried.

11:12.419 --> 11:15.452
My roboclowns died.

11:17.558 --> 11:20.524
Photo for your biggest fan?

11:20.526 --> 11:22.560
Say, "Cheese."

11:22.562 --> 11:23.597
Plas, no!

11:27.833 --> 11:31.235
That was the oldest trick
in the book, wasn't it?

11:31.237 --> 11:34.140
You are so
gonna get it later.

11:35.674 --> 11:39.643
I love it when they fall
for the classics.

11:40.847 --> 11:42.479
Oh, Plastic Man!

11:42.481 --> 11:45.618
Always clever,
but never too quick.

11:47.688 --> 11:49.222
Flash.

11:54.494 --> 11:55.593
Wow.

11:55.595 --> 11:58.662
I mean, really, wow.

12:00.098 --> 12:02.401
Batman is gonna be so mad.
He hates tardiness.

12:07.005 --> 12:09.409
Ooh, a chase scene.
I love chase scenes.

12:14.481 --> 12:15.747
<i>Captain Boomerang.</i>

12:15.749 --> 12:18.014
You know, you're the second
captain wearing blue

12:18.016 --> 12:19.417
that I've run into today.

12:19.419 --> 12:20.985
You guys have a club
or something?

12:20.987 --> 12:24.388
Yeah, it's the
"Let's destroy Flash" club.

12:24.390 --> 12:25.525
Uh-oh.

12:26.659 --> 12:28.558
And another, and another.

12:28.560 --> 12:29.962
<i>And another.</i>

12:32.064 --> 12:33.632
Ha! Missed me!

12:33.634 --> 12:35.669
- Oh, did I?
- Yeah, you did.

12:36.336 --> 12:37.534
Crikey!

12:43.342 --> 12:46.143
Well, that puts the boom
in Boomerang.

12:46.145 --> 12:47.912
Huh?

12:47.914 --> 12:49.747
I missed
the trouble alert.

12:49.749 --> 12:51.349
My bad, had it on vibrate.

12:51.351 --> 12:53.520
Batman is gonna be so mad.

12:55.053 --> 12:56.689
Blimey! Good shake.

13:02.562 --> 13:06.196
<i>Attention,
Metropolis Board of Tourism,</i>

13:06.198 --> 13:09.233
<i>I'm bored with your tourism.</i>

13:09.235 --> 13:11.469
<i>Where's the whimsy,
where's the fun?</i>

13:11.471 --> 13:14.271
<i>Well, I'm gonna give it to ya</i>

13:14.273 --> 13:17.074
<i>with my Fun Cannon.</i>

13:20.947 --> 13:22.245
At last,

13:22.247 --> 13:24.514
my greatest foe
plays his final card.

13:24.516 --> 13:26.884
And it's up to me alone
to stop him.

13:26.886 --> 13:29.320
This could be our end game.

13:29.322 --> 13:31.555
<i>The last battle in a long...</i>

13:31.557 --> 13:33.623
<i>Impressive, his weapon
charged so quickly.</i>

13:33.625 --> 13:36.730
He's going for the trigger. No time.
Have to strike now, go!

13:43.502 --> 13:47.372
Batsy, how I've missed you
in Gotham City.

13:47.374 --> 13:50.807
You're always off to play
with your superfriends now.

13:50.809 --> 13:54.845
So I came all the way to
Metropolis to join the fun.

13:54.847 --> 13:56.580
Fun's over, Joker.

13:56.582 --> 13:58.516
I foiled your plan.

13:58.518 --> 14:00.518
What? Oh.

14:00.520 --> 14:04.422
You thought your Batarang
defeated my Fun Cannon?

14:06.025 --> 14:08.460
Wait, then
what's that button for?

14:08.462 --> 14:09.627
This button?

14:09.629 --> 14:12.129
It turns on
the air conditioner.

14:12.131 --> 14:15.398
This button
fires my Fun Cannon.

14:16.669 --> 14:18.069
No!

14:18.071 --> 14:20.340
Too slow, Batsy.

14:33.119 --> 14:35.119
This does not look good.

14:35.121 --> 14:36.653
You're right.

14:36.655 --> 14:38.391
It looks hilarious.

14:40.393 --> 14:42.726
Thank you, thank you.
I'll be here all week.

14:42.728 --> 14:46.529
In fact, I think
I'll stay here forever!

14:51.837 --> 14:54.872
Now, if I just add this atom

14:54.874 --> 14:56.440
on to this molecule,

14:56.442 --> 14:58.645
it should make the gas inert.

14:59.678 --> 15:02.479
Eureka!
I've discovered the cure.

15:02.481 --> 15:05.084
Now, to synthesize a vaccine.

15:18.264 --> 15:20.267
Ta-da!

15:21.132 --> 15:22.932
I said...

15:25.270 --> 15:26.472
Ta-da.

15:34.612 --> 15:37.548
Batclown?

15:37.550 --> 15:40.619
Well, my work is done here.

15:47.726 --> 15:49.428
Huh?

15:51.898 --> 15:53.696
Sorry I'm late.

15:53.698 --> 15:55.365
He took down the Joker! Thank you!

15:57.770 --> 15:59.836
What?

15:59.838 --> 16:01.505
Thank you, thank you.

16:01.507 --> 16:03.240
You know,
it's all in a day's work.

16:03.242 --> 16:05.343
Whoa! What happened to you?

16:05.345 --> 16:08.912
This is what happens
when you're late!

16:08.914 --> 16:10.513
I know, I am so sorry.

16:10.515 --> 16:12.483
I had my League alert
on vibrate.

16:12.485 --> 16:15.052
And then a really busy morning with
Captain Cold and Captain Boomerang.

16:15.054 --> 16:16.387
But, hey,
the Joker is captured

16:16.389 --> 16:18.690
and everyone seems
no worse for wear.

16:18.692 --> 16:21.258
- Well, mostly...
- And the <i>Daily Planet?</i>

16:21.260 --> 16:22.692
What?

16:22.694 --> 16:26.465
Extreme building makeover
in three, two, one!

16:32.706 --> 16:33.874
Ta-da!

16:35.107 --> 16:38.008
- Hurray!
- Flash is the best.

16:38.010 --> 16:40.911
Super speed fixes everything.
Just like new.

16:40.913 --> 16:42.412
You want me
to fix you up, too, Batman?

16:42.414 --> 16:44.916
Not everything
can be fixed with speed.

16:44.918 --> 16:47.450
Flash, what Batman
is trying to say,

16:47.452 --> 16:49.186
is that we're you're friends.

16:49.188 --> 16:50.687
That's not what I said.

16:50.689 --> 16:54.157
And we want you to be
the best hero you can be.

16:54.159 --> 16:56.226
Sometimes that means
slowing down.

16:56.228 --> 16:58.295
Being aware
of your surroundings.

16:58.297 --> 17:01.201
And always having a plan.

17:02.168 --> 17:04.367
- Flash?
- Slow down.

17:04.369 --> 17:06.404
Surroundings and plan, got it.

17:06.406 --> 17:08.171
- Hashtag proactive.
<i>- Flash?</i>

17:08.173 --> 17:10.308
Updating my
Hero Hotline, Herogram.

17:10.310 --> 17:12.376
I-Hero, Herotopia and MyHero

17:12.377 --> 17:14.978
with my takedown
of the Joker.

17:14.980 --> 17:17.414
Oh, thank you, Justice League.

17:17.415 --> 17:19.983
We don't know
what we'd do without you.

17:19.986 --> 17:22.618
- Well...
- Well, Mayor, as long as I'm the fastest man alive,

17:22.621 --> 17:24.222
you'll never
have to worry about it.

17:24.223 --> 17:27.992
But you aren't
the fastest man alive.

17:27.993 --> 17:29.326
<i>You're a fraud,</i>

17:29.328 --> 17:30.961
just like the rest
of the Justice League.

17:30.963 --> 17:34.935
Something the world will see
soon enough.

17:38.137 --> 17:40.436
- Who was that?
- No clue.

17:40.438 --> 17:42.439
But I'm gonna find out.

17:42.441 --> 17:43.676
Flash, wait.

17:50.315 --> 17:52.552
Huh? This guy
is seriously fast.

17:55.054 --> 17:57.053
Are you wearing iron boots?

17:57.055 --> 17:58.356
I knew you would be slow,

17:58.358 --> 18:00.694
but I didn't know
you'd be this slow.

18:01.560 --> 18:03.961
No way you're beating me.

18:14.439 --> 18:16.709
Whoa! That's new.

18:23.815 --> 18:25.215
Wow!

18:25.217 --> 18:26.516
<i>Where am I?</i>

18:26.518 --> 18:29.153
Don't worry,
you'll see it again.

18:29.155 --> 18:30.457
Soon.

18:38.197 --> 18:40.500
Deja vu. Bah.

18:42.802 --> 18:44.303
You'd think I'd learn by now.

18:46.038 --> 18:47.039
Nice.

18:48.140 --> 18:50.607
Oh, yeah. It's go time!

18:50.609 --> 18:53.880
- Hey, you hit my car!
- What? That ain't my fault, look at my car.

18:55.148 --> 18:56.647
Guys, we did this yesterday,

18:56.649 --> 18:58.948
you really gotta watch
where you're going.

18:58.950 --> 19:00.517
Thanks, Flash.

19:00.519 --> 19:03.389
- No school.
- No way. No school?

19:04.590 --> 19:06.189
Two blowouts in a row?

19:06.191 --> 19:08.425
Listen, here's the card for a
tire shop I know across town.

19:08.427 --> 19:11.294
They'll give you a great deal on
new tires if you mention my name.

19:11.296 --> 19:13.030
- See ya.
- Uh...

19:13.032 --> 19:14.432
Thanks, Flash?

19:14.434 --> 19:16.032
Thanks, Flash.

19:19.304 --> 19:20.870
Whoa!

19:20.872 --> 19:23.006
Ha! You know, I like this one
even better than the one

19:23.008 --> 19:24.044
we put up yesterday.

19:24.877 --> 19:25.912
Thanks, Flash!

19:27.080 --> 19:28.512
Triple deja vu.

19:28.514 --> 19:29.813
Oh, hungry.

19:29.815 --> 19:31.514
You know what would make
my tummy feel better?

19:31.516 --> 19:33.516
Another round
of donuts at Fox's

19:33.518 --> 19:34.984
and this time I won't have
to worry about

19:34.986 --> 19:37.821
Captain Cold
interrupting my chowtime.

19:37.823 --> 19:39.223
- It's the Flash.
- Ooh!

19:39.926 --> 19:41.593
Best donut ever...

19:42.928 --> 19:44.227
Ugh. Seriously?

19:44.229 --> 19:45.862
There's no way
this is happening again.

19:45.864 --> 19:48.764
Chalk it up
to global freezing!

19:48.766 --> 19:51.167
- Well, now you're just repeating yourself.
- No, I'm not!

19:51.169 --> 19:54.071
Yeah, you said the same
thing to me yesterday.

19:54.073 --> 19:55.473
Yesterday?

19:55.475 --> 19:57.608
Yesterday I was
at home planning this heist.

19:57.610 --> 20:02.349
It looks like you might be suffering
from some brain freeze.

20:03.082 --> 20:04.381
I...

20:04.383 --> 20:05.616
I don't even have
a comeback for this,

20:05.618 --> 20:07.551
this is just too weird.

20:07.553 --> 20:09.485
Okay, one more time,
like this.

20:09.487 --> 20:10.955
Put that there,
you go over here.

20:10.957 --> 20:12.825
And I step out of the way.

20:15.494 --> 20:16.961
He's all yours, Officers.

20:16.963 --> 20:19.128
This time, try to keep him
in prison, would you?

20:19.130 --> 20:21.764
Hey, Flash, you know what
goes good with those donuts?

20:21.766 --> 20:23.367
Lampert's Milkshakes
in Star City?

20:23.369 --> 20:25.371
Oh, you've been there?

20:26.572 --> 20:28.105
Yeah, pretty sure.

20:32.378 --> 20:34.211
That's the same car.

20:34.213 --> 20:36.546
Something seriously
strange is going on.

20:36.548 --> 20:39.149
I have gotta get
to Metropolis.

20:42.088 --> 20:43.123
Hold this for me.

20:44.756 --> 20:45.792
Huh?

20:52.630 --> 20:54.098
Thanks, Flash.

20:54.100 --> 20:55.565
What a day.

20:55.567 --> 20:59.169
Fun's over,
I foiled your plan.

20:59.171 --> 21:00.737
What?

21:00.739 --> 21:05.274
Oh, you thought your Batarang
defeated my Fun Cannon?

21:06.678 --> 21:09.446
Wait, then what's
that button for?

21:09.448 --> 21:10.747
This button?

21:10.749 --> 21:12.949
It turns on
the air conditioner.

21:12.951 --> 21:16.887
This button
fires my Fun Cannon.

21:18.690 --> 21:20.959
- Huh?
- Looking for this?

21:25.698 --> 21:27.900
Ow, that looked painful.

21:30.969 --> 21:32.837
You're late.

21:32.839 --> 21:35.642
I was hoping for a,
"Thanks, Flash."

21:37.377 --> 21:39.377
Vacation's over.

21:39.379 --> 21:42.146
And I didn't even get a tan.

21:44.216 --> 21:46.817
Oh, man, guys, I have had
the weirdest day.

21:46.819 --> 21:48.852
It's like everything I did
yesterday is repeating itself.

21:48.854 --> 21:50.888
Except right now, because
when I got here yesterday,

21:50.890 --> 21:52.590
the <i>Daily Planet</i>
had been Joker-fied

21:52.592 --> 21:54.058
and Batman was
dressed like a clown.

21:54.060 --> 21:55.392
Highly unlikely.

21:55.394 --> 21:56.894
Flash, your tardiness today

21:56.896 --> 21:59.329
endangered this city
and the League. You need to...

21:59.331 --> 22:01.598
Slow down, be aware of my
surroundings and have a plan.

22:01.600 --> 22:04.135
Exact... Wait a minute.
Have I...

22:04.137 --> 22:06.469
Given the speech before?
Yes, yesterday.

22:06.471 --> 22:09.541
- Which feels like...
- Deja vu?

22:11.276 --> 22:13.144
You! You did this!

22:13.146 --> 22:16.379
I'm not sure what you did,
but I know it's your fault.

22:18.917 --> 22:20.884
- Who was that?
- No clue.

22:20.886 --> 22:23.955
- But I'm gonna find out.
- Flash, wait!

22:31.897 --> 22:33.563
Still not fast enough.

22:33.565 --> 22:35.499
You are not
getting away this time.

22:35.501 --> 22:37.099
You can't catch me.

22:37.101 --> 22:39.772
Maybe you'll have
better luck yesterday.

22:46.445 --> 22:47.511
Oh, man.

22:47.513 --> 22:49.115
My deja vu is having deja vu.

23:03.028 --> 23:04.029
Thanks, Flash!

23:05.296 --> 23:06.298
Thanks, Flash.

23:07.666 --> 23:09.367
Thanks, Flash.

23:09.369 --> 23:10.602
What a day.

23:12.871 --> 23:14.571
It's the trouble alert!

23:14.573 --> 23:16.840
Let's see
who needs our help today.

23:16.842 --> 23:19.176
This is Lois Lane
with <i>Breaking News.</i>

23:19.178 --> 23:21.911
Gotham City's clown prince
of crime, the Joker,

23:21.913 --> 23:23.880
was invading our beloved city,

23:23.882 --> 23:26.050
- but he suddenly vanished.
- Huh?

23:26.052 --> 23:29.320
Is your trouble alert always
this not troubling?

23:29.322 --> 23:30.620
Guys!

23:30.622 --> 23:32.054
Look, I stopped the Joker,
but listen.

23:32.056 --> 23:33.357
I've got an even
bigger problem.

23:33.359 --> 23:36.694
Great Scott, you're right.
Your pants!

23:36.696 --> 23:38.128
- <i>They're gone.</i>
- Huh?

23:38.130 --> 23:40.696
Looks like
you ran out of pants.

23:43.569 --> 23:45.735
So is Flash
actually in the League,

23:45.737 --> 23:48.571
or just, like,
an honorary member?

23:48.573 --> 23:51.574
Well, that explains the draft.

23:51.576 --> 23:53.244
Listen, I was
in a hurry and...

23:53.246 --> 23:55.978
<i>They'll never
believe you, Flash.</i>

23:55.980 --> 23:58.850
This will be
our little secret.

23:59.718 --> 24:01.819
- Who's that?
- Get back here!

24:01.821 --> 24:03.454
Flash, wait.

24:10.394 --> 24:11.761
Still not fast enough.

24:11.763 --> 24:13.332
Try harder next time.

24:15.767 --> 24:18.968
That's it!
This is the last time.

24:52.537 --> 24:53.739
Flash, wait.

24:54.474 --> 24:55.675
Flash, wait.

24:56.742 --> 24:58.241
Flash, wait.

24:58.243 --> 24:59.245
Batman.

25:02.915 --> 25:05.049
Aren't you the best sidekick ever?

25:05.051 --> 25:07.551
Yes, you are. Yes, you are.

25:07.553 --> 25:09.686
Aw, I want a Bat belly rub.

25:09.688 --> 25:11.687
Batman, I just...
Don't worry.

25:11.689 --> 25:15.324
I took care of Captain Cold,
Captain Boomerang and the Joker.

25:15.326 --> 25:16.961
Thank you?

25:16.963 --> 25:18.794
And I only have a few minutes
before it starts all over again.

25:18.796 --> 25:20.597
Before what
starts all over again?

25:20.599 --> 25:24.201
Referencing events yet to happen?
An agitated emotional state?

25:24.203 --> 25:25.168
Time loop.

25:25.170 --> 25:27.705
- Yes, that's it.
- Impossible.

25:27.707 --> 25:29.473
This isn't
our first tangle with time.

25:29.475 --> 25:31.440
Happens a lot
in the superhero business.

25:31.442 --> 25:33.711
I keep living the same day
over and over again.

25:33.713 --> 25:35.344
I feel like
I've hit a dead end.

25:35.346 --> 25:36.914
Fun fact.

25:36.916 --> 25:39.849
At the subatomic level, dead ends
aren't really dead ends at all.

25:39.851 --> 25:42.418
There is always space
between the molecules

25:42.420 --> 25:45.057
that allow atoms
to move between them and...

25:46.425 --> 25:48.024
And you don't care.

25:48.026 --> 25:50.494
So, Batman, what should I do?

25:50.496 --> 25:54.598
Hmm, it's theoretically possible
to break out of a time loop.

25:54.600 --> 25:57.333
But frankly, I don't think
you're fast enough.

25:57.335 --> 25:58.667
Not fast enough?

25:58.669 --> 26:01.171
I thought you would
have the answer, Batman.

26:01.173 --> 26:02.174
I was wrong.

26:03.809 --> 26:06.909
Nice reverse
psychology, Batman.

26:06.911 --> 26:08.911
That's just what
he needed to hear.

26:08.913 --> 26:10.446
Now where's he going?

26:10.448 --> 26:12.851
Not where. When.

26:15.387 --> 26:17.521
You still can't
seem to catch me.

26:31.736 --> 26:33.102
Why won't it fly, Dad?

26:33.104 --> 26:34.870
There needs to be a wind.

26:34.872 --> 26:36.473
- Whoa!
- Son!

26:36.475 --> 26:40.042
This is amazing!

26:43.582 --> 26:46.084
Just a little faster, Flash.

26:46.985 --> 26:49.552
Not today or again or...

26:49.554 --> 26:50.957
Whatever!

26:57.897 --> 27:01.400
Everything is
going perfectly to plan.

27:06.605 --> 27:09.072
Whoa.

27:09.074 --> 27:11.375
Well, at least
I'm not in bed again.

27:11.377 --> 27:13.044
But where am I?

27:14.446 --> 27:16.178
We hate you, Flash.

27:16.180 --> 27:18.482
You're horrible. You're awful.

27:18.484 --> 27:20.884
Boo!

27:20.886 --> 27:23.453
What a phenomenal
disappointment.

27:23.455 --> 27:25.021
What was that about?

27:25.023 --> 27:27.490
Everyone loves the Flash.

27:27.492 --> 27:29.295
At least they used to.

27:31.496 --> 27:33.865
Okay, this is crazy, I need
to get back to the League.

27:35.501 --> 27:36.666
That's weird.

27:36.668 --> 27:38.534
Let's try that again.

27:38.536 --> 27:40.736
My powers.

27:40.738 --> 27:41.972
They're gone.

27:41.974 --> 27:44.010
I've gotta get to the Hall!

27:46.911 --> 27:48.177
Oh, man.

27:48.179 --> 27:51.883
I can see
why people hate to run.

27:53.886 --> 27:56.022
Maybe Cyborg can fix my...

27:56.955 --> 27:59.025
- Hmm.
- Hmph.

28:01.360 --> 28:03.959
Uh, hey, guys,
why the mean faces?

28:03.961 --> 28:05.529
You starched my cape.

28:05.531 --> 28:08.965
You switched my shampoo
with fire extinguishing cream!

28:08.967 --> 28:11.001
You painted my invisible jet.

28:11.003 --> 28:12.101
Now it's just...

28:12.103 --> 28:14.003
Just visible!

28:14.005 --> 28:16.372
You replaced my arm
with an egg beater.

28:16.374 --> 28:18.108
Sure the eggs are amazing,
but still.

28:18.110 --> 28:19.709
And you decided
it would be fun

28:19.711 --> 28:22.478
to mix up the pouches
on my utility belt.

28:22.480 --> 28:23.612
What?

28:23.614 --> 28:25.180
No, no, I didn't do
any of those things,

28:25.182 --> 28:26.782
you don't understand.

28:26.784 --> 28:29.119
There was this blurry guy
and we started running and...

28:29.121 --> 28:30.821
We don't wanna hear it, Flash.

28:30.823 --> 28:33.223
You've pulled at least 52
pranks on the Justice League

28:33.225 --> 28:35.591
in the five days since
I've joined.

28:35.593 --> 28:36.693
Five days?

28:36.695 --> 28:38.329
You just joined this morning.

28:38.331 --> 28:40.030
I'm outta here.

28:40.032 --> 28:41.398
Atom's right.

28:41.400 --> 28:44.767
Flash, your pranks
require punishment.

28:44.769 --> 28:46.469
You're fired.

28:46.471 --> 28:48.273
Uh... Uh...

29:07.525 --> 29:08.625
Oh.

29:08.627 --> 29:10.463
No power, no League.

29:11.095 --> 29:12.696
What do I do now?

29:12.698 --> 29:14.633
Fade into obscurity I hope.

29:15.766 --> 29:18.134
Hey, that's my costume.

29:18.136 --> 29:20.172
Is it? I hadn't noticed.

29:22.873 --> 29:23.939
You!

29:23.941 --> 29:25.809
The pranks, the time loop.

29:25.811 --> 29:27.042
It was all you.

29:27.044 --> 29:28.978
You messed
with the wrong hero,

29:28.980 --> 29:32.448
yellow blur guy.

29:32.450 --> 29:35.851
Uh-uh-uh. Don't blame me for
the time loop, Barry.

29:35.853 --> 29:39.455
You were the fool that had to prove
you were the fastest man alive.

29:39.457 --> 29:42.859
<i>But you didn't know about
the Speed Force, did you?</i>

29:42.861 --> 29:46.163
<i>A force that runs through
all of space and time.</i>

29:46.165 --> 29:48.130
<i>Every time you chased me
into the Speedway,</i>

29:48.132 --> 29:52.135
<i>I led you backwards in time to
relive the same day over and over.</i>

29:52.137 --> 29:54.003
<i>And while you were
stuck in your time loop,</i>

29:54.005 --> 29:55.671
<i>I turned everyone against you,</i>

29:55.673 --> 29:58.576
<i>and then tricked you into
severing your Speed Force power.</i>

30:01.413 --> 30:03.847
But why? What did
I ever do to you?

30:03.849 --> 30:05.051
What did you...

30:06.184 --> 30:08.252
What didn't you do?

30:08.254 --> 30:10.986
The Flash, according
to future history books,

30:10.988 --> 30:12.754
the world's favorite hero.

30:12.756 --> 30:14.890
So funny, so perfect.

30:14.892 --> 30:16.994
So fast!

30:16.996 --> 30:18.895
But I'm faster.

30:18.897 --> 30:23.867
Yet, nobody will recognize my greatness
while I live in your shadow.

30:23.869 --> 30:25.569
That is why I,

30:25.571 --> 30:27.270
the Reverse-Flash,

30:27.272 --> 30:31.774
have traveled back in time
to ruin you.

30:31.776 --> 30:34.177
So, you're from the future

30:34.179 --> 30:36.346
and you call yourself
Reverse-Flash?

30:36.348 --> 30:37.848
Ugh. Really? I mean...

30:37.850 --> 30:39.983
- Do you run backwards or something?
- No.

30:39.985 --> 30:42.119
- Are you super slow?
- No.

30:42.121 --> 30:43.820
I'm just the reverse of you.

30:43.822 --> 30:45.455
You're good and I'm bad.

30:45.457 --> 30:47.657
Then wouldn't you be called
Evil Flash

30:47.659 --> 30:48.824
or Bad Flash?

30:48.826 --> 30:51.561
I'm just Reverse-Flash, okay?

30:51.563 --> 30:52.564
Okay.

30:53.264 --> 30:56.131
That's enough of that.

30:58.536 --> 31:01.838
Please, Barry.
You know how it is.

31:01.840 --> 31:03.106
Me, fast,

31:03.108 --> 31:05.375
you, slow.

31:05.377 --> 31:07.176
<i>Now that you've been beaten,</i>

31:07.178 --> 31:08.779
it's time for
the world to know

31:08.781 --> 31:12.648
who is truly the greatest
speedster of all time.

31:12.650 --> 31:15.651
My friends in the Justice
League will stop you.

31:15.653 --> 31:17.119
Your friends?

31:17.121 --> 31:19.689
You mean the people that just
kicked you out of their club?

31:19.691 --> 31:22.492
Well, I'll tell you
what, Barry.

31:22.494 --> 31:26.228
Since you care
for them so much

31:26.230 --> 31:29.898
I'm going to
take care of them next.

31:40.678 --> 31:42.744
Looks like Flash
was telling the truth.

31:42.746 --> 31:45.247
This Reverse-Flash character
kept him in a time loop

31:45.249 --> 31:47.183
while he ruined
his reputation.

31:47.185 --> 31:49.121
That rotten rascal.

31:51.791 --> 31:53.023
Whoa.

31:53.025 --> 31:54.824
- I broke 'em.
- Don't worry, Flash.

31:54.826 --> 31:57.526
Once I enlarge, we'll inform
the Justice League together

31:57.528 --> 31:59.929
and stop this
fast-paced villain. Hmm?

31:59.931 --> 32:02.499
Oh, this isn't good.
This isn't good at all.

32:02.501 --> 32:06.570
My white dwarf shrinking belt must've shorted
out when those shackles stunned Flash,

32:06.572 --> 32:09.238
along with my
communication systems.

32:09.240 --> 32:10.940
Flash! Can you hear me?

32:10.942 --> 32:13.676
- Flash! Flash, over here, Flash.
- Great.

32:13.678 --> 32:15.811
What do I do now?
I'm powerless.

32:15.813 --> 32:18.715
My friends, if you can call them
that, kicked me out of the League.

32:18.717 --> 32:21.851
Oh, this can't be
happening to me.

32:21.853 --> 32:23.218
You think you have problems?

32:23.220 --> 32:25.088
I'm too small
to be seen or heard.

32:25.090 --> 32:27.690
At least you can pick up
the phone and talk to some...

32:27.692 --> 32:28.827
Wait a second.

32:32.697 --> 32:35.064
I can't give Flash
his powers back.

32:35.066 --> 32:36.899
But I know someone who might.

32:36.901 --> 32:40.270
And the only thing that stands
between me and helping the Flash...

32:40.272 --> 32:42.237
Is fruit salad.

32:42.239 --> 32:43.476
How hard can this be?

32:44.876 --> 32:47.480
Whoa!

32:53.953 --> 32:56.355
Yes!

33:04.795 --> 33:05.797
Ha!

33:06.665 --> 33:09.131
Huh? Oh.

33:14.738 --> 33:16.673
That's weird,
usually when I butt-dial,

33:16.675 --> 33:18.140
my butt is actually
near the phone.

33:18.142 --> 33:20.278
Uh-oh.

33:26.083 --> 33:30.253
<i>Welcome to
Doctor Fate's magic helpline.</i>

33:30.255 --> 33:33.924
<i>Do you feel like the world's
turned against you?</i>

33:33.926 --> 33:35.692
Yes, yes, I do.

33:35.694 --> 33:39.295
<i>Do you feel like you've lost
that pep in your step?</i>

33:39.297 --> 33:41.898
Oh, wow. Yeah,
I've lost all my pep.

33:41.900 --> 33:45.068
<i>Do you feel like someone is trying
to take your place in life?</i>

33:45.070 --> 33:49.105
<i>Maybe kick you out of a club?
Or League?</i>

33:49.107 --> 33:52.675
I don't know who this guy is,
but he is good.

33:52.677 --> 33:54.811
<i>Well, if any of that
applies to you,</i>

33:54.813 --> 33:58.414
<i>do yourself a solid
and press one, now.</i>

33:58.416 --> 34:01.684
Well, Barry,
let's hope this helps.

34:03.721 --> 34:04.955
Huh?

34:04.957 --> 34:07.090
Wait, wait, wait!

34:07.092 --> 34:09.326
I'm going with you.

34:09.328 --> 34:12.963
It looks like I'm going
to have to do this the hard way.

34:12.965 --> 34:14.862
I'll just have to
get to Metropolis

34:14.864 --> 34:16.666
and tell the Justice League
everything that's happened.

34:16.668 --> 34:18.467
It shouldn't be that hard.

34:18.469 --> 34:21.774
I'll just slip under Flash's
front door, hop on a bus and...

34:22.639 --> 34:23.641
Oh, no.

34:29.947 --> 34:31.481
Now that the Flash is gone,

34:31.483 --> 34:33.949
we'll need someone else
to take the minutes.

34:33.952 --> 34:36.554
Oh! Me! Me! Me!

34:38.023 --> 34:39.489
- Cyborg?
- Yes.

34:44.563 --> 34:47.295
It looks like trouble
is springing up all over the map.

34:47.297 --> 34:50.300
All right, team, split up and
let's take care of business.

34:50.302 --> 34:51.934
Cyborg, read that back to me.

34:51.936 --> 34:54.803
"All right, team, split up and
let's take care of business.

34:54.804 --> 34:56.571
"Cyborg, read that
back to me."

34:56.572 --> 34:58.707
Good job, let's move.

34:58.709 --> 35:00.242
"Good job.

35:00.244 --> 35:02.714
"Let's M-O-V-E."

35:06.651 --> 35:10.053
Too long have humans gorged
themselves at the salad bar.

35:10.055 --> 35:14.256
Now it's time for the plants
to gorge at the human bar.

35:16.294 --> 35:18.028
Stop.

35:18.030 --> 35:21.463
I'm the Mayor,
I command you to stop.

35:25.537 --> 35:28.637
Sorry, Poison Ivy.

35:28.639 --> 35:29.905
I heard someone screaming.

35:29.907 --> 35:31.740
And you know,
"I scream, you scream,

35:31.742 --> 35:33.544
"we all scream for ice cream."

35:34.278 --> 35:35.481
Get him.

35:41.619 --> 35:44.153
Oh, man.

35:44.155 --> 35:46.891
- Plants should be seen, not heard.
- Huh?

35:49.695 --> 35:52.428
"Wimbley for Mayor"?

35:52.430 --> 35:54.696
A mayoral float! Oh!

35:54.698 --> 35:57.733
- Thank you, Mr...
- Reverse-Flash is my name

35:57.735 --> 36:00.535
and helping people out
is my game.

36:00.537 --> 36:02.472
Now, I must be away.

36:02.474 --> 36:06.276
There are other citizens
that need my help.

36:09.213 --> 36:11.180
Signal watch. Signal watch.

36:11.182 --> 36:12.948
Come on, Superman.

36:12.950 --> 36:17.519
This will teach Olsen not to
take a photo of my bad side.

36:17.521 --> 36:18.954
I'm sorry, Mr. Croc.

36:18.956 --> 36:22.057
It's just, with you
every side is a bad side.

36:22.059 --> 36:23.325
<i>Killer Croc!</i>

36:23.327 --> 36:26.129
Unhand Superman's pal,
Jimmy Olsen.

36:26.131 --> 36:27.399
Never!

36:30.468 --> 36:32.804
I've got this, Plas.

36:34.606 --> 36:36.874
I can cut logs, too, Supes,
check it out.

36:46.751 --> 36:47.820
Plas!

36:51.189 --> 36:53.559
Uh-oh.

36:54.626 --> 36:57.660
How did you do that?

36:57.662 --> 37:01.363
Child's play
for Reverse-Flash.

37:01.365 --> 37:04.702
Say, I don't suppose you have
a signal watch, do you?

37:06.371 --> 37:07.671
Deathstroke!

37:07.673 --> 37:09.875
He's stealing
our shipment of gold!

37:12.077 --> 37:14.309
Gold is a great
investment in your future.

37:14.311 --> 37:18.280
But the only future
you've got is behind bars.

37:34.865 --> 37:37.200
All in a day's work for...

37:37.202 --> 37:39.505
Reverse-Flash.

37:41.305 --> 37:43.138
Reverse-Flash is the best!

37:43.140 --> 37:44.874
Reverse-Flash, you did it.

37:44.876 --> 37:46.142
Trouble at sea?

37:46.144 --> 37:48.343
Aquaman is in.

37:48.345 --> 37:50.412
Reverse-Flash took care of it.

37:50.414 --> 37:52.182
Aquaman is out.

37:54.285 --> 37:55.617
I'm embarrassed.

37:55.619 --> 37:57.188
But I'm also
a little impressed.

38:03.093 --> 38:05.729
All right, Penguin,
drop your weapon.

38:05.731 --> 38:08.097
Yeah. I'll drop my weapon,
all right.

38:08.099 --> 38:10.435
On you!

38:15.173 --> 38:18.110
Not before
I get the drop on you.

38:22.447 --> 38:23.782
Uh-oh.

38:27.452 --> 38:29.718
Batman just
launched the missile.

38:29.720 --> 38:31.187
We're doomed!

38:31.189 --> 38:34.693
Don't worry. Reverse-Flash
will take care of it.

38:38.095 --> 38:39.097
What?

38:52.276 --> 38:53.542
Hurray!

38:53.544 --> 38:55.211
He built
a perfectly safe playground

38:55.213 --> 38:59.149
- out of explosive missile parts.
- Amazing.

38:59.151 --> 39:01.483
Courtesy of the...

39:01.485 --> 39:03.688
Reverse-Flash.

39:06.291 --> 39:09.559
Yeah. Let's hear it
for Reverse-Flash.

39:09.561 --> 39:12.128
Reverse-Flash, huh?

39:12.130 --> 39:13.164
Hmm.

39:17.702 --> 39:18.934
That was weird.

39:18.936 --> 39:20.705
But not like
floating castle weird.

39:23.608 --> 39:26.541
Wow. Magical stairs.

39:26.543 --> 39:28.112
I wish there was
a magic escalator.

39:35.954 --> 39:37.720
Huh?

39:43.128 --> 39:44.660
Yeah, um...

39:44.662 --> 39:47.396
I'm talking backwards.

39:47.398 --> 39:49.131
Just come in, okay?

39:49.133 --> 39:50.635
Okay, sure.

40:10.555 --> 40:13.222
Wow. You guys
really like stairs.

40:13.224 --> 40:15.425
<i>Flash, come forward.</i>

40:15.427 --> 40:20.296
<i>The Doctor is in
and your fate awaits.</i>

40:20.298 --> 40:21.731
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

40:21.733 --> 40:23.133
<i>Zatanna.</i>

40:24.669 --> 40:28.838
I can't believe backwards talking
101 is a magic requirement.

40:28.840 --> 40:33.776
<i>- Zatanna!</i>
- Sorry! Uh, I mean, "Yrros."

40:33.778 --> 40:36.582
Yeah, that's
not strange at all.

40:49.626 --> 40:52.827
Huh? Whoa!

40:52.829 --> 40:56.233
This is the second weirdest
room I've ever been in.

40:59.671 --> 41:02.674
- Don't be afraid. Come closer.
- Huh?

41:03.474 --> 41:06.075
Welcome to my sanctum.

41:06.077 --> 41:08.445
- I'm the...
- Flash, I know.

41:08.447 --> 41:10.412
I'm Doctor Fate.

41:10.414 --> 41:12.448
It's nice to finally meet you.

41:12.450 --> 41:18.320
Please tell me your blues, and
we'll, uh, sort it out.

41:18.322 --> 41:19.722
My blues?

41:19.724 --> 41:23.093
Well, a couple of days ago,
I was stuck in a time loop.

41:24.162 --> 41:27.564
Okay, uh,
does she always do that?

41:27.566 --> 41:30.131
It's magic, man! Keep going.

41:30.133 --> 41:31.800
Um, okay.

Magic.

43:07.532 --> 43:10.666
Anyway, can your magic tell me
why I've lost my powers?

43:10.668 --> 43:12.938
Hmm.

43:15.807 --> 43:20.111
It looks like your connection
to the Speed Force is broken.

43:20.744 --> 43:22.077
Speed Force?

43:22.079 --> 43:23.680
Reverse-Flash
said something about that.

43:23.682 --> 43:25.548
But I have no idea
what he meant.

43:25.550 --> 43:26.916
What's the Speed Force?

43:26.918 --> 43:28.249
A mysterious energy

43:28.251 --> 43:31.854
that grants the ability
to move at super speed.

43:31.856 --> 43:34.756
Oh. The day I got my powers?

43:34.758 --> 43:36.791
That was a total fluke.

43:36.793 --> 43:38.894
You see, there was this lightning and
then these chemicals spilled on me...

43:38.896 --> 43:40.662
That's what you thought.

43:40.664 --> 43:44.399
The reality is that you were
chosen to be the Flash.

43:44.401 --> 43:47.470
These powers
are a gift given to you

43:47.472 --> 43:49.972
<i>from the Speed Force.</i>

43:49.974 --> 43:52.675
But your connection to it
was broken.

43:52.677 --> 43:54.642
So, what now? Can you fix it?

43:54.644 --> 43:56.144
No.

43:56.146 --> 43:59.414
But I can take you to where
the Speed Force lives.

43:59.416 --> 44:01.716
- Where it lives?
- Yes.

44:01.718 --> 44:03.419
We're going to

44:03.421 --> 44:05.588
the Speed Force Zone.

44:05.590 --> 44:08.524
The Speed Force Zone. That
sounds awesome.

44:08.526 --> 44:09.892
Step back.

44:09.894 --> 44:12.461
It's magic time.

44:12.463 --> 44:16.566
With the force of fate
and wits unified,

44:16.568 --> 44:20.238
take us away on a groovy ride.

44:27.811 --> 44:30.946
- Whoo-hoo! Field trip!
- Zatanna?

44:30.948 --> 44:33.818
Yrros.

44:37.220 --> 44:41.090
That's... That's the place I saw when I
was running after the Reverse-Flash.

44:41.092 --> 44:43.492
It's called the Speedway.

44:43.494 --> 44:46.964
Our gateway to
the Speed Force Zone.

44:53.903 --> 44:55.370
<i>Journal entry 13.</i>

44:55.372 --> 44:58.774
<i>Things have not gone
as planned.</i>

44:58.776 --> 45:01.042
<i>Unable to grow
to my normal size,</i>

45:01.044 --> 45:05.316
<i>the world around me has become more
dangerous than you can possibly imagine.</i>

45:06.249 --> 45:08.850
<i>Every car, a cataclysm.</i>

45:08.852 --> 45:10.954
<i>Every mouse, a monster.</i>

45:12.990 --> 45:15.758
<i>Every meter, a marathon.</i>

45:21.064 --> 45:24.733
<i>Experiments always start with a question.
Here's mine.</i>

45:24.735 --> 45:26.702
<i>How am I going to survive?</i>

45:31.876 --> 45:33.910
<i>That was the scene today,</i>

45:33.912 --> 45:37.812
<i>as the Reverse-Flash continues his
unprecedented streak of heroism.</i>

45:37.814 --> 45:41.117
<i>It would seem that the Reverse-Flash
is the only superhero</i>

45:41.119 --> 45:43.753
<i>the world will ever need.</i>

45:45.023 --> 45:47.023
Just look at that
trouble alert map.

45:47.025 --> 45:49.665
Reverse-Flash is so fast, he's
stopping crime before we can even...

45:50.660 --> 45:51.894
Finally an emergency.

45:51.896 --> 45:54.162
Aw, yeah!

45:54.164 --> 45:56.532
He got there first.

45:56.534 --> 45:59.468
That's 22 emergencies
he's fixed today.

45:59.470 --> 46:03.375
And he's just passed me
in friends on Herobook.

46:06.977 --> 46:10.646
Well, it's a good thing things
like this aren't important at all

46:10.648 --> 46:13.715
to the Man of Steel.

46:13.717 --> 46:15.450
<i>It seems that
the Reverse-Flash</i>

46:15.452 --> 46:18.720
<i>has agreed to sit down
for a chat with the Mayor.</i>

46:18.722 --> 46:20.289
<i>Stay tuned for live coverage</i>

46:20.291 --> 46:23.325
<i>of our beloved
heroic speedster.</i>

46:23.327 --> 46:26.896
I think it's about time
we had a word with this

46:26.898 --> 46:29.898
beloved speedster.

46:29.900 --> 46:34.503
Whoo-hoo! I'm gonna get my powers back!
I'm gonna get my powers back!

46:34.505 --> 46:36.372
Oh.

46:36.374 --> 46:39.774
But, uh, first,
I might need a snack.

46:42.046 --> 46:43.479
Thank you.

46:43.481 --> 46:45.814
Shouldn't you be driving?

46:45.816 --> 46:47.483
Don't worry.

46:47.485 --> 46:50.084
The Doc just gave me my magician's
permit for hands-free driving.

46:50.086 --> 46:52.187
- Zatanna.
- Yrros.

46:52.189 --> 46:55.124
Now listen, when you arrive
at the Speed Force Zone,

46:55.126 --> 46:57.059
you'll go through
a series of tests

46:57.061 --> 47:00.195
to make sure you're worthy.

47:00.197 --> 47:01.430
Worthy of what?

47:01.432 --> 47:04.233
That's what
you need to find out.

47:04.235 --> 47:06.202
That's the mystery.

47:06.204 --> 47:09.037
That's the magic.

47:09.039 --> 47:12.140
Yeah. Yeah. But you'll be
there to help me, right?

47:12.142 --> 47:13.441
I'm sorry.

47:13.443 --> 47:15.244
The Speed Force Zone
is only accessible

47:15.246 --> 47:17.245
to those with speed powers.

47:17.247 --> 47:21.950
Or in your case,
former speed powers.

47:21.952 --> 47:23.885
Well, this is it.

47:23.887 --> 47:25.954
- Any parting words?
- Yeah.

47:25.956 --> 47:28.624
Tuck and roll, baby.

47:28.626 --> 47:30.191
Tuck and roll?

47:30.193 --> 47:32.063
- What is that...
- Yrros.

47:40.470 --> 47:41.738
Oh.

47:41.740 --> 47:43.004
Whoa.

47:43.006 --> 47:45.006
Wow. Would you look at that?

47:45.008 --> 47:49.111
It's some sort of Speed
Force Zone temple thingy.

47:49.113 --> 47:52.615
And it almost feels like the temple
is giving off some sort of energy.

47:52.617 --> 47:54.716
The Speed Force!

47:54.718 --> 47:56.218
If that's where
the Speed Force is,

47:56.220 --> 47:59.490
that's where I need to be,
and fast.

48:04.861 --> 48:08.463
All right. These must be the tests
Doctor Fate was talking about.

48:08.465 --> 48:12.300
<i>Bricks moving superfast,
vibrating through solid matter.</i>

48:12.302 --> 48:15.137
And I just have to make it
to the other side.

48:15.139 --> 48:17.742
Well, this shouldn't be
too hard.

48:23.146 --> 48:25.048
Those speed bricks
really pack a wallop,

48:25.050 --> 48:27.619
but if at first
you don't succeed...

48:37.428 --> 48:41.363
Okay.
This is not working.

48:41.365 --> 48:43.532
There has to be a trick.

48:43.534 --> 48:47.970
We want you to be the best
hero you can be.

48:47.972 --> 48:52.744
Sometimes that means
slowing down.

48:54.778 --> 48:57.912
Mmm. Slow down.

48:57.914 --> 48:59.548
Yeah, thanks, Supe.

48:59.550 --> 49:03.188
Well, going fast didn't work,
and Fate said I'd be tested.

49:11.361 --> 49:14.629
How is this working?

49:14.631 --> 49:19.104
I really, really, really
hate going slow.

49:21.204 --> 49:22.537
Holy moly.

49:22.539 --> 49:24.939
It actually worked!
I did it!

49:24.941 --> 49:26.242
Piece of cake.

49:30.314 --> 49:31.646
<i>Journal entry 14.</i>

49:31.648 --> 49:34.551
<i>The situation
has grown sticky.</i>

49:37.053 --> 49:38.787
<i>But I must keep my wits
about me.</i>

49:38.789 --> 49:41.990
<i>I must use everything
at my disposal to survive.</i>

49:41.992 --> 49:44.729
<i>I must use science!</i>

49:46.530 --> 49:48.763
<i>A little known hypothesis
about arachnids</i>

49:48.765 --> 49:52.133
<i>is that they can be hypnotized
by flashing lights.</i>

49:52.135 --> 49:54.135
<i>Time to test that theory.</i>

49:54.137 --> 49:56.004
<i>Can science prevail?</i>

49:56.006 --> 49:57.840
<i>Will the spider be hypnotized?</i>

49:57.842 --> 50:02.180
<i>Will I learn about spider
digestion from the inside?</i>

50:04.747 --> 50:05.948
Eureka!

50:10.153 --> 50:11.852
Aha!

50:11.854 --> 50:13.988
<i>Studies have shown tha
some birds can be tamed</i>

<i>by applying gentle pressure to
a special nerve on the back.</i>

50:17.762 --> 50:21.832
<i>This</i> Columba livia domestica
<i>proves those studies correct.</i>

<i>I have this game on my phone.</i>

50:45.789 --> 50:48.057
All I have to do
is ride these to the top.

50:49.325 --> 50:50.859
Ow! Whoa. That hurt.

50:50.861 --> 50:53.428
Maybe this is some sort of
endurance test.

50:53.430 --> 50:55.963
I just have to show
I can take it.

50:58.501 --> 51:00.837
I can't take it!

51:18.889 --> 51:23.392
Be aware
of your surroundings.

51:23.394 --> 51:25.830
My surroundings?

51:30.468 --> 51:32.501
Huh?

51:32.503 --> 51:34.606
I never noticed
those platforms before.

51:37.640 --> 51:41.809
Wow, the path to the door
was there the whole time.

51:45.615 --> 51:47.515
Ha! Easy-peasy, lemon...

51:47.517 --> 51:49.954
Still hurts. Still hurts.

51:56.392 --> 52:00.128
Thank you for joining us,
Reverse-Flash.

52:00.130 --> 52:01.629
It's my pleasure, Mayor.

52:01.631 --> 52:03.865
I serve with the pleasure

52:03.867 --> 52:07.836
You won't see me in some
private island clubhouse, no.

52:07.838 --> 52:12.006
I love being
the servant of the people.

52:12.008 --> 52:13.742

52:17.347 --> 52:19.448
Why are
we sneaking around?

52:19.450 --> 52:21.783
You know this is how
Batman does things.

52:21.785 --> 52:23.584
We're spying on Reverse-Flash,

52:23.586 --> 52:25.687
because Batman thinks
he'll eventually trip up

52:25.689 --> 52:28.323
and reveal
his true evil intentions.

52:28.325 --> 52:29.624
Correct, Cyborg.

52:29.626 --> 52:31.160
This is a covert op.

52:31.162 --> 52:34.729
We'll spy from the shadows,
move in the shadows,

52:34.731 --> 52:35.930
be the...

52:35.932 --> 52:37.966

<i>Never. He's not wearing any.</i>

Shh.

53:02.727 --> 53:05.093
As I'm sure
everyone at home would agree,

53:05.095 --> 53:10.097
you have made Metropolis
and the world a safer place.

53:10.099 --> 53:13.102
You're a hero
that never asks for accolades

53:13.104 --> 53:16.470
or wears something
as gaudy as a cape.

53:16.472 --> 53:18.039
- Gaudy?
- Gaudy?

53:18.041 --> 53:19.474
And for that,

53:19.476 --> 53:21.809
we'd like to honor you

53:21.811 --> 53:23.778
with the key to the city.

53:23.780 --> 53:26.715
Thank you,
fine citizens of Metropolis.

53:26.717 --> 53:30.218
I accept your paltry...
I mean, precious gift.

53:31.856 --> 53:34.088
Soon the world will realize
what you have already learned.

53:34.090 --> 53:36.791
That I, Reverse-Flash,

53:36.793 --> 53:40.664
am the only hero
you will ever need.

53:42.099 --> 53:43.532
No, Plastic Man.

53:43.534 --> 53:44.633
<i>You're putting too much weight
on the support beam.</i>

53:44.635 --> 53:46.571
You need to...

53:48.905 --> 53:52.841
This is why
the Batman works alone.

53:52.843 --> 53:54.142
Oh, look!

53:54.144 --> 53:56.044
It's the Justice League.

53:56.046 --> 53:59.347
Or should I say
the Jobless League.

54:03.119 --> 54:05.553
Sadly, I agree.

54:05.555 --> 54:08.756
- Huh?
- This can only mean one thing.

54:08.758 --> 54:12.593
The Justice League
is now retired.

54:22.139 --> 54:23.405
Whoo-hoo!

54:23.407 --> 54:25.410
Whoa! Huh?

54:26.443 --> 54:29.510
Whoa!

54:29.512 --> 54:31.546
<i>A maze?
Well, I love mazes!</i>

54:31.548 --> 54:34.517
They're amazing.

54:34.519 --> 54:37.921
I'm almost there. I can
feel my powers coming back.

54:41.758 --> 54:44.628
Hey, look at that.
Almost back to full speed.

54:46.329 --> 54:48.565
Yeah! Oh, no. Huh?

55:01.043 --> 55:03.412
So all I have to do is get
through the maze in the dark.

55:03.414 --> 55:06.580
With my super speed back,
that shouldn't be a problem.

55:06.582 --> 55:09.119
<i>Ow, ow, ow!</i>

55:11.220 --> 55:13.588
Okay. It's a problem!

55:13.590 --> 55:16.992
What is it with this place
trying to hurt me?

55:16.994 --> 55:18.894
What was it Batman said?

55:18.896 --> 55:20.629
- Always have a plan.
- Always have a plan.

55:20.631 --> 55:23.000
Okay, so, Flash,
what's your plan?

55:26.003 --> 55:28.303
Oh! I can make a plan
from up here.

55:28.305 --> 55:30.238
Okay. Now let's see.

55:30.240 --> 55:33.075
<i>Left, right, right, right.
Wait, no, no, no, no.</i>

55:33.077 --> 55:36.477
<i>Okay. Left, right, right,
right, left...</i>

55:36.479 --> 55:38.946
<i>Okay. Left, right, left,</i>

55:38.948 --> 55:41.216
left, right, left, right,
left, left,

55:41.218 --> 55:44.251
right, right, left, left.
Perfect.

55:44.253 --> 55:45.755
Okay, I got it. I got it.

55:51.028 --> 55:52.359
Whoo-hoo!

55:52.361 --> 55:53.865
The final door.

55:57.034 --> 56:00.269
Aw, come on! How can I get
through this solid door?

56:00.271 --> 56:01.639
It's a dead end!

56:02.238 --> 56:03.338
Fun fact.

56:03.340 --> 56:04.638
At the subatomic level,

56:04.640 --> 56:06.908
dead ends aren't really
dead ends at all.

56:06.910 --> 56:09.176
There is always space
between the molecules

56:09.178 --> 56:11.782
that allow atoms
to move between them.

56:13.550 --> 56:14.850
If the Atom is right,

56:14.852 --> 56:17.184
and there is space
between everything,

56:17.186 --> 56:19.722
I just have to do
what the speed bricks did

56:19.724 --> 56:22.825
and vibrate my molecules
to fit between them.

56:22.827 --> 56:26.130
Well, here goes everything.

56:29.765 --> 56:32.035
Whoa! Whoo!

56:34.872 --> 56:37.207
I just vibrated
through that wall.

56:38.342 --> 56:40.010
I can do anything!

56:40.644 --> 56:41.977
That's it.

56:41.979 --> 56:45.015
I can feel it
radiating the Speed Force.

56:52.021 --> 56:53.387
Wow!

56:53.389 --> 56:55.892
It's some kind of nexus.

57:00.430 --> 57:01.796
It's amazing!

57:01.798 --> 57:04.298
I've finally done it!

57:04.300 --> 57:06.068
Nothing can stop...

57:06.070 --> 57:08.068
Whoa!

57:08.070 --> 57:09.105
Huh?

57:09.907 --> 57:11.439
At last!

57:11.441 --> 57:12.975
<i>Reverse-Flash?</i>

57:12.977 --> 57:15.644
- But how?
- Still too slow, aren't you?

57:15.646 --> 57:17.111
The time loop.

57:17.113 --> 57:20.015
You breaking your connection
to the Speed Force,

57:20.017 --> 57:22.283
I knew it would all
lead you here,

57:22.285 --> 57:24.017
to the Speed Force nexus.

57:24.019 --> 57:27.021
And also, through that
ridiculous obstacle course...

57:27.023 --> 57:29.158
I mean, are you kidding me?

57:29.160 --> 57:30.490
<i>Dangerous!</i>

57:30.492 --> 57:34.662
So I duped you into opening
the three doors for me.

57:34.664 --> 57:37.399
Congratulations, loser!

57:37.401 --> 57:38.633
And now,

57:38.635 --> 57:40.736
with the power of the nexus,

57:40.738 --> 57:43.006
nothing can stand in my way.

57:49.613 --> 57:51.012
The power!

57:51.014 --> 57:55.651
It's... It's like
drinking 52 milkshakes

57:55.653 --> 57:58.419
and eating
a bag of jelly beans!

57:58.421 --> 58:01.289
Invigorating!

58:01.291 --> 58:04.225
The nexus is mine!
I earned it!

58:04.227 --> 58:05.459
Ooh.

58:05.461 --> 58:07.998
Good luck being trapped here
for all eternity.

58:19.776 --> 58:22.142
I can't believe
that we're retiring.

58:22.144 --> 58:24.178
I mean,
where do we go from here?

58:24.180 --> 58:26.481
Heroes, Cyborg,
never give up hope.

58:26.483 --> 58:30.385
And I haven't given up
investigating Reverse-Flash.

58:30.387 --> 58:33.521
<i>Oh, how the mighty
have fallen.</i>

58:33.523 --> 58:35.756
<i>The once great Justice League</i>

58:35.758 --> 58:38.727
<i>forced into retirement.</i>

58:38.729 --> 58:41.028
<i>Face it, super zeroes,</i>

58:41.030 --> 58:42.631
<i>you're yesterday's news!</i>

58:42.633 --> 58:47.167
<i>Today's fast-paced world
needs a hero like yours truly.</i>

58:47.169 --> 58:50.405
<i>And thanks
to your old pal, Flash,</i>

58:50.407 --> 58:53.908
<i>future history books
will know only me</i>

58:53.910 --> 58:56.144
<i>as Earth's greatest champion.</i>

58:56.146 --> 58:57.214
<i>Watch.</i>

58:57.780 --> 58:59.683
Look, outside!

59:13.563 --> 59:14.762
What is he doing?

59:14.764 --> 59:16.430
He's walling us in.

59:16.432 --> 59:18.966
He must not be aware
of my super strength.

59:18.968 --> 59:21.204
Or my ability
to transform matter.

59:25.376 --> 59:26.477
Uh-oh.

59:30.546 --> 59:31.815
I'm too late!

59:35.651 --> 59:37.584
What kind of material is that?

59:37.586 --> 59:39.320
Not the normal kind.

59:39.322 --> 59:42.758
My scanners indicate these bricks
are moving at an incredible speed.

59:42.760 --> 59:44.024
The kinetic energy
they're putting off

59:44.026 --> 59:46.461
is enough to counteract
any of our powers.

59:46.463 --> 59:49.030
<i>Right you are, Cybore.</i>

59:49.032 --> 59:53.135
<i>Those are speed bricks
from the Speed Force Zone.</i>

59:53.137 --> 59:55.135
Does that sound made-up
to anyone else?

59:55.137 --> 59:57.137
<i>Enjoy the rest of your days</i>

59:57.139 --> 59:59.807
<i>trapped inside
your little clubhouse.</i>

59:59.809 --> 01:00:01.542
<i>Oh, one more thing.</i>

01:00:01.544 --> 01:00:04.345
<i>I've activated your Hall of
Justice security systems</i>

01:00:04.347 --> 01:00:06.146
<i>and equipped them
with countermeasures</i>

01:00:06.148 --> 01:00:08.483
<i>for each of your powers.</i>

01:00:08.485 --> 01:00:12.488
<i>So you might wanna
be careful in there.</i>

01:00:12.490 --> 01:00:15.490
<i>Destroy. Destroy.</i>

01:00:15.492 --> 01:00:17.658
Not my cybots!

01:00:17.660 --> 01:00:18.859
You monster.

01:00:18.861 --> 01:00:20.428
What do we do?

01:00:20.430 --> 01:00:22.999
Against the most powerful security
system I've ever devised?

01:00:23.566 --> 01:00:24.899
We run.

01:00:28.238 --> 01:00:30.604
<i>How could I have bee
so stupid?</i>

01:00:30.606 --> 01:00:34.475
At every step, I've played
into the Reverse-Flash's hand.

01:00:34.477 --> 01:00:35.809
He took away my powers.

01:00:35.811 --> 01:00:37.945
He took away my friends.

01:00:37.947 --> 01:00:41.417
Oh, I just
wanna go home.

01:00:48.090 --> 01:00:50.191
It's vibrating, like...

01:00:50.193 --> 01:00:52.829
Like they have the Speed Force
inside of them.

01:00:53.396 --> 01:00:54.398
I have a plan.

01:00:57.566 --> 01:00:58.700
Not bad.

01:00:58.702 --> 01:01:00.434
Not bad at all.

01:01:00.436 --> 01:01:02.806
Now let's see what
these speed bricks can do.

01:01:03.706 --> 01:01:05.375
Whoa!

01:01:22.059 --> 01:01:23.390
All my hard work,

01:01:23.392 --> 01:01:25.892
all the trials
and tribulations,

01:01:25.894 --> 01:01:28.363
for nothing.

01:01:28.365 --> 01:01:29.963
Huh?

01:01:32.102 --> 01:01:35.035
The Super-Pets! Huh.

01:01:35.037 --> 01:01:37.037
All this trouble
with Reverse-Flash

01:01:37.039 --> 01:01:40.008
and they're just
digging a hole!

01:01:40.010 --> 01:01:41.675
Under the wall.

01:01:41.677 --> 01:01:43.678
Of course! Brilliant!

01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:46.383
Hey, guys, wait for me!

01:01:50.486 --> 01:01:51.921
Cyborg's laboratory.

01:01:52.588 --> 01:01:54.189
Great job, gang.

01:01:54.191 --> 01:01:57.124
Now I can use Cyborg's tools
to repair my shrinking belt

01:01:57.126 --> 01:01:59.193
and return to normal size.

01:01:59.195 --> 01:02:02.363
Hey.

01:02:02.365 --> 01:02:04.131
Well, I've collected
enough data.

01:02:04.133 --> 01:02:06.001
You guys
aren't so bad after all.

01:02:06.003 --> 01:02:07.267
<i>Alert! Alert!</i>

01:02:07.269 --> 01:02:09.206
<i>You must be eliminated.</i>

01:02:15.746 --> 01:02:17.512
Fascinating.

01:02:17.514 --> 01:02:18.912
Green Lantern has a pet,

01:02:18.914 --> 01:02:21.249
and he's a ring-wielding
squirrel?

01:02:21.251 --> 01:02:23.617
Hey! Who you calling pet,
short stack?

01:02:23.619 --> 01:02:24.885
You can talk?

01:02:24.887 --> 01:02:27.356
Yeah, because
I ain't no squirrel.

01:02:27.358 --> 01:02:28.590
Name's B'dg.

01:02:28.592 --> 01:02:30.158
I'm from another planet

01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:33.861
of people that happen to loosely
resemble your squirrels.

01:02:33.863 --> 01:02:36.798
I see. Well, that
makes perfect sense.

01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:39.233
Oh, I'm so glad
you approve.

01:02:39.235 --> 01:02:41.468
My buddy Ace here
sent down an alert.

01:02:41.470 --> 01:02:42.470
Let me guess,

01:02:42.472 --> 01:02:44.571
the Justice League
is in trouble?

01:02:44.573 --> 01:02:45.939
Bark.

01:02:45.941 --> 01:02:47.242
As per usual.

01:02:47.244 --> 01:02:50.979
Well, let's go
rescue them, again.

01:02:50.981 --> 01:02:52.446
Can someone explain

01:02:52.448 --> 01:02:55.149
how Reverse-Flash
can turn my cybots against us?

01:02:55.151 --> 01:02:57.619
Somehow his speed power's
been supercharged.

01:02:57.621 --> 01:03:00.021
Time to fall back
and form a plan.

01:03:00.023 --> 01:03:03.124
By the toenails of Tartarus,
I wish that Flash was here.

01:03:04.660 --> 01:03:07.061
Hey, guys, over here!

01:03:07.063 --> 01:03:10.164
<i>Eliminate. Eliminate.</i>

01:03:10.166 --> 01:03:11.966
Thanks for
the quick save, gang.

01:03:13.936 --> 01:03:15.303
I can't hold them off forever.

01:03:15.305 --> 01:03:17.037
We need to find a way
out of here.

01:03:17.039 --> 01:03:18.872
And leave this paradise?

01:03:18.874 --> 01:03:20.274
Who knew Aquaman's bedroom

01:03:20.276 --> 01:03:22.776
was like the best day spa
in the planet?

01:03:22.778 --> 01:03:24.812
Ooh, ha!

01:03:24.814 --> 01:03:27.282
Of course, the king of
the sea has a waterbed.

01:03:27.284 --> 01:03:29.249
- Plas!
- Guys?

01:03:29.251 --> 01:03:32.620
Hang in there, Superman.
The Super-Pets have a plan.

01:03:32.622 --> 01:03:33.921
Not a pet.

01:03:37.894 --> 01:03:40.528
I believe
they're calling someone.

01:03:40.530 --> 01:03:41.995
You speak dog now?

01:03:41.997 --> 01:03:45.168
No, I just understand
my friends.

01:03:49.972 --> 01:03:51.104
A seahorse?

01:03:51.106 --> 01:03:53.274
Yet another Super-Pet?

01:03:53.276 --> 01:03:55.242
Again, not a pet.

01:03:55.244 --> 01:03:56.544
This is Storm.

01:03:56.546 --> 01:03:58.412
He's fought
alongside Aquaman before,

01:03:58.414 --> 01:04:01.048
so he's always ready
to lend a hand.

01:04:01.050 --> 01:04:03.218
Or a fin. Huh?

01:04:03.220 --> 01:04:05.119
Guys?

01:04:05.121 --> 01:04:07.354
Superman, stay super.

01:04:07.356 --> 01:04:09.457
Storm, we'll need you
to lead us out to sea

01:04:09.459 --> 01:04:11.693
through the ocean tunnel you came from.

01:04:11.695 --> 01:04:13.762
But first,
we'll need a vehicle.

01:04:13.764 --> 01:04:15.662
How about a sub?

01:04:15.664 --> 01:04:18.999
Get it?
A submarine sandwich.

01:04:19.001 --> 01:04:21.070
- Sorry...
- That'll work.

01:04:21.738 --> 01:04:23.474
Aw! Not again.

01:04:32.483 --> 01:04:35.416
One supersized sub
ready for action.

01:04:35.418 --> 01:04:37.318
- Guys!
- Let's go, Superman.

01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:38.687
Yeah, what's the hold-up?

01:04:38.689 --> 01:04:42.557
<i>Eliminate. Eliminate.</i>

01:04:42.559 --> 01:04:46.196
<i>Eliminate...
Oh, my, what a lovely room.</i>

01:04:47.063 --> 01:04:50.099
Storm, to the Batcave.

01:04:54.403 --> 01:04:56.570
The <i>Daily Planet,</i>

01:04:56.572 --> 01:05:01.175
soon to be renamed the
<i>Reverse-Flash Planet.</i>

01:05:01.177 --> 01:05:02.943
And the perfect antenna

01:05:02.945 --> 01:05:06.582
<i>to broadcast my manifesto
across the world!</i>

01:05:07.450 --> 01:05:09.383
<i>Hello, planet Earth!</i>

01:05:09.385 --> 01:05:13.921
<i>It's me, the most beloved
superhero of all time,</i>

01:05:13.923 --> 01:05:15.490
<i>Reverse-Flash.</i>

01:05:15.492 --> 01:05:16.624
Ooh!

01:05:16.626 --> 01:05:19.894
The Reverse-Flash.
I love him.

01:05:19.896 --> 01:05:22.463
<i>Now that
I've rid the world of crime,</i>

01:05:22.465 --> 01:05:26.332
<i>I think it's time for you
to repay old R.F.</i>

01:05:26.334 --> 01:05:28.436
<i>for his kind generosity.</i>

01:05:28.438 --> 01:05:32.205
That's why I'm ordering
everyone to report

01:05:32.207 --> 01:05:34.541
<i>to my Reverse-Flash
command centers.</i>

01:05:34.543 --> 01:05:38.945
<i>There, you'll be given orders
on what I, your new ruler,</i>

01:05:38.947 --> 01:05:42.115
<i>would like you to do.
Doesn't that sound wonderful?</i>

01:05:42.117 --> 01:05:45.887
Cheeky monkey, I always knew he was rotten.

01:05:45.889 --> 01:05:47.421
<i>Now hurry!</i>

01:05:47.423 --> 01:05:50.024
<i>You don't want what I did
to the Justice League</i>

01:05:50.026 --> 01:05:54.162
<i>to happen to you.</i>

01:05:54.164 --> 01:05:57.834
With his increased powers, none
of us are any match for him.

01:06:01.003 --> 01:06:04.070
Ah! I've been looking everywhere
for you guys. Now listen,

01:06:04.072 --> 01:06:06.541
I know you're probably still
mad at me for those pranks,

01:06:06.543 --> 01:06:08.675
but the thing is,
it wasn't me.

01:06:08.677 --> 01:06:10.544
It was this cheating,
evil, dirty,

01:06:10.546 --> 01:06:13.080
doofus-faced imposter
from the future named...

01:06:13.082 --> 01:06:15.182
Reverse-Flash.

01:06:15.184 --> 01:06:17.686
Wait. You knew
he was impersonating me?

01:06:17.688 --> 01:06:21.055
No, we didn't.
Not at first.

01:06:21.057 --> 01:06:22.823
But there were three clues.

01:06:22.825 --> 01:06:24.992
<i>Your mysterious
time loop trouble.</i>

01:06:24.994 --> 01:06:27.595
<i>Your sudden interest
in childish pranks.</i>

01:06:27.597 --> 01:06:31.365
<i>A sudden denial of said pranks
and loss of powers.</i>

01:06:31.367 --> 01:06:34.535
Your unusual behavior patterns
led me to believe that somehow,

01:06:34.537 --> 01:06:36.671
some way, someone,
somewhere,

01:06:36.673 --> 01:06:39.441
was framing you
for some unknown purpose.

01:06:39.443 --> 01:06:43.211
So, you fired me to flush out
the Reverse-Flash?

01:06:43.213 --> 01:06:45.178
Exactly.
Batman knew that

01:06:45.180 --> 01:06:46.914
once he accomplished
his evil goals

01:06:46.916 --> 01:06:48.416
<i>he'd reveal himself to you.</i>

01:06:48.418 --> 01:06:50.785
<i>That's why I was
gonna be there when he did.</i>

01:06:50.787 --> 01:06:52.486
<i>I shrunk down
onto your shoulder</i>

01:06:52.488 --> 01:06:54.189
<i>and was going to report back
to the League</i>

01:06:54.191 --> 01:06:56.957
<i>until Reverse-Flash's shackle
shorted out my circuits,</i>

01:06:56.959 --> 01:06:59.626
<i>which kept me
stuck in shrink mode.</i>

01:06:59.628 --> 01:07:02.430
Then that means you guys
never really gave up on me.

01:07:02.432 --> 01:07:03.930
Of course not.

01:07:03.932 --> 01:07:05.533
We're superfriends, man.

01:07:05.535 --> 01:07:07.568
We were sorry
to deceive you, Flash.

01:07:07.570 --> 01:07:10.004
It was our only play
to get you out of trouble.

01:07:10.006 --> 01:07:12.338
Thank you, everyone.

01:07:12.340 --> 01:07:14.175
Yeah, yeah,
real heartwarming.

01:07:14.177 --> 01:07:16.845
And now, it's my turn
to get us all out of trouble.

01:07:16.847 --> 01:07:19.379
We can stop the Reverse-Flash
with these.

01:07:19.381 --> 01:07:20.849
Speed Force bricks.

01:07:20.851 --> 01:07:22.582
And we can use the bricks
from my speed machine

01:07:22.584 --> 01:07:24.285
to superpower
our other vehicles.

01:07:24.287 --> 01:07:27.588
Giving us all enough speed
to keep up with Reverse-Flash.

01:07:27.590 --> 01:07:30.258
Well, I don't have my speed
powers back yet, Wonder Woman,

01:07:30.260 --> 01:07:32.325
but I have something better.

01:07:32.327 --> 01:07:33.930
I have a plan.

01:07:36.066 --> 01:07:38.666
<i>Tell them all, the landmarks
you build today</i>

01:07:38.668 --> 01:07:42.669
<i>will glorify my name tomorrow
and for all eternity.</i>

01:07:42.671 --> 01:07:44.372
Look, it's the Justice League!

01:07:44.374 --> 01:07:47.975
History will know the fastest
man alive was always...

01:07:47.977 --> 01:07:49.213
Huh?

01:07:59.122 --> 01:08:00.488
Hurray!

01:08:00.490 --> 01:08:03.224
Hey, everybody!
We're not retired anymore!

01:08:03.226 --> 01:08:04.792
The Justice League is back.

01:08:04.794 --> 01:08:07.861
- And the Dark Knight returns.
- Bark.

01:08:07.863 --> 01:08:10.999
So you've
escaped the Hall of Justice

01:08:11.001 --> 01:08:14.334
with help from your pets,
no doubt.

01:08:14.336 --> 01:08:17.037
I hope you enjoyed
your freedom,

01:08:17.038 --> 01:08:20.506
because it will be
the last thing you ever see.

01:08:20.509 --> 01:08:22.577
Powering on the speed bricks.

01:08:25.380 --> 01:08:27.617
Tickles!

01:08:32.388 --> 01:08:34.154
Whoa! Look at that!

01:08:34.156 --> 01:08:36.657
It looks like
everything just stopped.

01:08:36.658 --> 01:08:39.760
No wonder the Flash
is always moving so fast.

01:08:39.761 --> 01:08:42.729
It must be boring to live
in a world going so slow.

01:08:42.732 --> 01:08:44.731
If we'd known
it was like this,

01:08:44.733 --> 01:08:46.667
we might have been
more patient with him.

01:08:46.669 --> 01:08:49.169
Lesson learned, team.
Look alive.

01:08:49.171 --> 01:08:53.408
Somehow you've gained
the power of the Speed Force.

01:08:53.410 --> 01:08:56.843
No matter. I'm still
faster than all of you.

01:08:56.845 --> 01:08:59.348
Evasive maneuvers.
Split up.

01:09:02.618 --> 01:09:05.319
You're still no match
for the nexus.

01:09:05.321 --> 01:09:07.520
I can move so fast
I can seem to be

01:09:07.522 --> 01:09:09.356
in five different places
at the same time.

01:09:09.358 --> 01:09:11.995
And I can take care of all
of you, once and for all!

01:09:17.767 --> 01:09:19.970
- Ready, B'dg?
- You bet.

01:09:24.107 --> 01:09:27.444
<i>My bricks are
returning to the Speed Force Zone!</i>

01:09:28.176 --> 01:09:30.410
No!

01:09:30.412 --> 01:09:31.877
Looks like
the Flash was right.

01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:33.747
The speed bricks
have given our vehicles

01:09:33.750 --> 01:09:36.149
the ability
to destroy those statues.

01:09:36.152 --> 01:09:37.520
Go get 'em, gang!

01:09:48.130 --> 01:09:50.462
- Target locked.
- Fire!

01:09:50.465 --> 01:09:52.102
<i>It's away!</i>

01:10:11.353 --> 01:10:13.721
No!

01:10:13.723 --> 01:10:15.989
I don't know
how you got those speed bricks

01:10:15.991 --> 01:10:17.490
but your plan failed.

01:10:17.492 --> 01:10:19.025
I'm powerful enough

01:10:19.027 --> 01:10:21.294
to beat the Justice League,
no matter where you are!

01:10:21.296 --> 01:10:22.896
We weren't trying to beat you.

01:10:22.898 --> 01:10:24.966
We were trying
to distract you.

01:10:24.968 --> 01:10:26.103
What?

01:10:43.119 --> 01:10:44.918
Impossible. How did you...

01:10:44.920 --> 01:10:46.520
The trials
in the Speed Force Zone

01:10:46.522 --> 01:10:48.189
weren't just there
to see if I was worthy,

01:10:48.191 --> 01:10:50.356
they were there
to teach me something.

01:10:50.358 --> 01:10:53.328
Something you would have known if you
took the time to go through them.

01:10:53.330 --> 01:10:54.694
Enough of this!

01:10:54.696 --> 01:10:56.797
I still have enough
of the nexus energy

01:10:56.799 --> 01:10:58.999
to defeat the likes of you.

01:11:13.249 --> 01:11:16.182
So much power!

01:11:16.184 --> 01:11:19.087
Which is rightfully mine!

01:11:19.089 --> 01:11:22.457
You didn't even know what the Speed
Force was until I showed up.

01:11:22.459 --> 01:11:25.860
What makes you think you know
enough about it now to defeat me?

01:11:25.862 --> 01:11:28.361
Only one way to find out.

01:11:29.832 --> 01:11:31.835
You'll never beat me, Flash.

01:11:33.568 --> 01:11:36.002
I'm the master
of the Speed Force!

01:11:36.004 --> 01:11:38.271
Really? Wouldn't a master
have a plan

01:11:38.273 --> 01:11:40.039
so he doesn't get tripped up?

01:11:41.378 --> 01:11:42.778
<i>Guess not.</i>

01:11:46.549 --> 01:11:49.484
You're looking tired.
Maybe you should slow down.

01:11:49.486 --> 01:11:51.418
- No!
- Okay.

01:11:51.420 --> 01:11:53.052
What?

01:11:56.326 --> 01:11:58.092
- Hurts, doesn't it?
- Huh?

01:11:58.094 --> 01:12:00.560
Way to be aware of your
surroundings, Speed Force master.

01:12:00.562 --> 01:12:03.297
You may have won today,

01:12:03.299 --> 01:12:04.864
but I'll travel back in time

01:12:04.866 --> 01:12:07.036
and stop you
from getting the nexus.

01:12:08.537 --> 01:12:10.136
I don't think you have
enough steam, R.F.

01:12:10.138 --> 01:12:12.873
It looks like the last
of the nexus energy is gone.

01:12:12.875 --> 01:12:15.943
Without it,
you're just not fast enough.

01:12:15.945 --> 01:12:19.314
Fast enough?
I'm the fastest man alive!

01:12:19.316 --> 01:12:20.648
I am!

01:12:20.650 --> 01:12:21.918
Prove it.

01:12:28.558 --> 01:12:29.923
- Come on, R.F.
- Huh?

01:12:29.925 --> 01:12:33.427
You can go faster than that.

01:12:33.429 --> 01:12:36.032
Really? That's all you've got?

01:12:44.307 --> 01:12:45.509
What?

01:12:49.277 --> 01:12:51.511
Handcuffs can't hold me.

01:12:51.513 --> 01:12:53.646
All I have to do is...

01:12:53.648 --> 01:12:56.585
Huh? What?

01:12:57.253 --> 01:12:59.186
My powers.

01:12:59.188 --> 01:13:01.989
Uh-uh-uh. Looks like someone broke
his connection to the Speed Force.

01:13:01.991 --> 01:13:03.291
<i>Tsk, tsk.</i>

01:13:03.293 --> 01:13:05.258
You should have slowed down.

01:13:05.260 --> 01:13:08.595
You! You tricked me!

01:13:08.597 --> 01:13:11.364
No, no.
I just executed my plan.

01:13:11.366 --> 01:13:13.066
You won't get away with this!

01:13:13.068 --> 01:13:14.502
I'll come back!

01:13:14.504 --> 01:13:17.573
Sorry. I... I can't understand
when you're talking so slow.

01:13:28.550 --> 01:13:29.919
Mummy.

01:13:32.955 --> 01:13:34.454
Well, we won't have
any trouble

01:13:34.456 --> 01:13:35.955
from Reverse-Flash
for a while.

01:13:35.957 --> 01:13:38.659
- What about the nexus thingy?
- What about it?

01:13:38.661 --> 01:13:40.028
With power like that,

01:13:40.030 --> 01:13:43.230
you could do
the job of every hero forever.

01:13:43.232 --> 01:13:46.035
Looks like the Justice League
is still retired.

01:13:47.303 --> 01:13:48.569
No.

01:13:48.571 --> 01:13:50.436
No one should have
this much power.

01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:05.086
You...

01:14:05.088 --> 01:14:07.189
You gave up all that speed.

01:14:07.589 --> 01:14:08.855
But why?

01:14:08.857 --> 01:14:11.057
Well, it turns out
that slowing down

01:14:11.059 --> 01:14:13.159
was the best way
to defeat Reverse-Flash.

01:14:13.161 --> 01:14:15.730
The nexus power had him
so distracted,

01:14:15.732 --> 01:14:18.132
he was totally unaware
of his surroundings.

01:14:18.134 --> 01:14:20.168
No way would I ever
let that happen to me.

01:14:20.170 --> 01:14:23.671
Returning the nexus was
always a part of my... plan,

01:14:23.673 --> 01:14:27.744
and these were all the things you
guys were trying to teach me.

01:14:28.344 --> 01:14:30.177
Thank you.

01:14:30.179 --> 01:14:32.879
Without friends like you, I would
have lost my powers forever.

01:14:32.881 --> 01:14:35.283
And we would have been
retired forever.

01:14:35.285 --> 01:14:36.484
That reminds me,

01:14:36.486 --> 01:14:38.552
is there a Justice League
pension plan or...

01:14:38.554 --> 01:14:40.753
It's good
to have you back, Flash.

01:14:40.755 --> 01:14:43.056
And with newfound wisdom
to guide you.

01:14:43.058 --> 01:14:45.359
That may be true,
Wonder Woman,

01:14:45.361 --> 01:14:46.828
but Flash has only proven

01:14:46.830 --> 01:14:48.995
he's ready for the next
level of training.

01:14:48.997 --> 01:14:50.797
Now begins the true test

01:14:50.799 --> 01:14:53.767
of Flash's mental acuity
and fortitude.

01:14:53.769 --> 01:14:55.869
The training crucible
I have prepared

01:14:55.871 --> 01:14:57.671
will destroy hidden weakness

01:14:57.673 --> 01:15:00.474
and forge the inner strength required to...

01:15:00.476 --> 01:15:02.075
Hmm. It sounds great, Batman.

01:15:02.077 --> 01:15:03.778
Let's get started on that.

01:15:03.780 --> 01:15:06.279
Right after a little snack.

01:15:06.281 --> 01:15:09.816
The nexus has been
returned to the Speed Force.

01:15:09.818 --> 01:15:13.352
And order has been restored
to the universe.

01:15:13.354 --> 01:15:15.055
And all it took was...

01:15:15.057 --> 01:15:18.057
