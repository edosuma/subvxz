WEBVTT

00:18.150 --> 00:20.152
(ringtone playing)

00:27.993 --> 00:31.030
*

00:35.568 --> 00:37.370
(whistling breath)

00:38.404 --> 00:40.039
"George Bernard Shaw."

00:40.072 --> 00:43.075
* Let me see the future

00:43.108 --> 00:44.410
(sighs)

00:44.444 --> 00:49.415
* Before I'm gone,
oh, oh, oh, oh *

00:49.449 --> 00:54.220
* Let my friends all die

00:54.254 --> 00:58.190
* Before I go,
oh, oh, oh, oh *

00:58.224 --> 01:00.092
(gagging)

01:02.528 --> 01:07.967
* 'Cause I'm too old
to die young *

01:10.202 --> 01:15.875
* I can't even
remember being young *

01:15.908 --> 01:19.545
* I can't even remember
being young. *

01:19.579 --> 01:22.114
Oh!

01:22.147 --> 01:24.250
Jimbo, you made me
breakfast in bed?

01:24.284 --> 01:27.353
Yeah, right. What have you
done to merit breakfast?

01:27.387 --> 01:29.188
Well, at least
you brought me a mimosa.

01:29.221 --> 01:31.691
Uh, no, that's my
backup. It's stronger.

01:31.724 --> 01:33.259
You might observe,

01:33.293 --> 01:35.695
"Jimmy, how zoetic and
vital you seem today."

01:35.728 --> 01:38.030
"How observant, G-dog,"

01:38.063 --> 01:39.465
I might respond.

01:39.499 --> 01:41.367
For today, I build
my tree house!

01:41.401 --> 01:43.102
You see, during
Vernon's podcast...

01:43.135 --> 01:44.370
During what now?

01:44.404 --> 01:45.738
I learned that my father's voice

01:45.771 --> 01:47.540
has been in my head
my entire life.

01:47.573 --> 01:49.241
Dude, I have the same thing,
but with my mom's voice.

01:49.275 --> 01:50.543
It's like she's constant...

01:50.576 --> 01:51.711
Yeah, as I was
saying about myself,

01:51.744 --> 01:53.746
ever since the funeral,
that voice has been

01:53.779 --> 01:55.080
slowly subsiding.

01:55.114 --> 01:57.617
It is my hope
that the final nail

01:57.650 --> 02:00.219
in that tree house will be
the final nail in the coffin

02:00.252 --> 02:02.655
that is my father's influence.

02:02.688 --> 02:03.923
R.I.P., dickhead.

02:03.956 --> 02:05.224
I'm telling you, Gretchen,

02:05.257 --> 02:07.226
now that I have
been de-fathered,

02:07.259 --> 02:10.630
my world is positively
pregnant with possibilities.

02:10.663 --> 02:12.965
Great, but isn't it your job
to finish your book?

02:12.998 --> 02:13.966
Is it?

02:13.999 --> 02:15.501
I don't know anymore.

02:15.535 --> 02:17.637
Oy.

02:17.670 --> 02:19.104
I guess I can't talk.

02:19.138 --> 02:21.307
I'm reading goddamn self-help.

02:21.341 --> 02:25.177
Oh, yes, that's sure to
solve your myriad problems.

02:25.210 --> 02:27.413
My therapist recommended it.

02:27.447 --> 02:28.981
It's about mindfulness,

02:29.014 --> 02:30.916
which is about
being completely--
No!

02:30.950 --> 02:32.284
I think you'd actually
like therapy.

02:32.318 --> 02:34.086
It's really helpful
to look at your life

02:34.119 --> 02:35.755
from a different perspective.

02:35.788 --> 02:38.791
Like when they stood on the
desks in Dead Poets Society.

02:38.824 --> 02:40.526
Didn't that one kid
shoot himself?

02:40.560 --> 02:42.194
Like I'm learning
how because of my mom's

02:42.227 --> 02:45.431
impossibly high expectations,
I can never turn my brain off.

02:45.465 --> 02:48.801
I am really opening the trunk
and seeing what's inside.

02:48.834 --> 02:50.470
Don't you mean the hood?

02:50.503 --> 02:52.872
Your trunk's just cartons
of Mexican cigarettes,

02:52.905 --> 02:54.640
old Halloween wigs

02:54.674 --> 02:57.777
and five bags of clothes
you never donated to Goodwill.

02:57.810 --> 03:00.312
I really need to get a handle
on this mindfulness shit.

03:00.346 --> 03:02.482
I am doing the work.

03:02.515 --> 03:04.183
I'm evolving, Jimmy.

03:04.216 --> 03:06.318
I just don't want you
to get left behind.

03:06.352 --> 03:07.787
I think I'll manage.

03:07.820 --> 03:09.789
Anyway, look.

03:09.822 --> 03:11.056
(sing-songy):
Blueprints!

03:11.090 --> 03:13.125
Do not touch
with your syrup

03:13.158 --> 03:15.828
and-God-knows-what-else-since
you-don't-wash-your-legs hands.

03:15.861 --> 03:17.863
Look at us!

03:17.897 --> 03:20.666
You're changing careers
to building tree houses.

03:20.700 --> 03:23.503
I'm exploring the roots
of my mental illness.

03:23.536 --> 03:27.039
Hey, before we change too much,
you want to knock one out?

03:27.072 --> 03:29.442
Sure.

03:33.546 --> 03:36.449
Eh, you can start.
I'll catch up.

03:41.020 --> 03:44.256
(moaning)

03:49.194 --> 03:51.997
* I'm gonna leave you anyway

03:52.031 --> 03:54.734
* I'm gonna leave you
anyway *

03:54.767 --> 03:58.070
* Gonna leave you anyway.

04:01.974 --> 04:04.944
(muffled moaning and thumping)

04:08.047 --> 04:10.416
Let's do this.

04:12.452 --> 04:14.219
(phone buzzing)
Nothing can slow me down,

04:14.253 --> 04:16.355
but who says that
eating on the run...

04:16.387 --> 04:17.757
What is going on?

04:17.790 --> 04:20.125
You have been blowing
up all morning.

04:20.159 --> 04:22.094
High Times tweeted
my Dr. Weed video,

04:22.127 --> 04:25.698
and now I'm getting all these
annoying tweets from stoners.

04:25.731 --> 04:28.100
I don't want to be a pot person.

04:28.133 --> 04:30.870
You make videos with a
character called "Dr. Weed,"

04:30.903 --> 04:33.372
and you smoke all
day, every day.

04:33.405 --> 04:37.209
Listen, Dorothy,

04:37.242 --> 04:39.378
I stopped taking my meds.

04:39.411 --> 04:42.214
What? You went off your meds
and you didn't tell me?
Yeah.

04:42.247 --> 04:44.249
I didn't want to, you know,
declare anything

04:44.283 --> 04:46.786
until I saw how it worked,
and listen,

04:46.819 --> 04:50.255
a lot of vets are using weed
to help with their PTSD.

04:50.289 --> 04:52.825
I mean, sure, I might take a
little longer to do some things.

04:52.858 --> 04:54.727
Like this morning,
I laughed for 15 minutes

04:54.760 --> 04:56.996
because the bathroom faucet
kind of looks like a face.

04:57.029 --> 04:57.963
(laughter)

04:57.997 --> 05:00.332
But I feel...

05:00.365 --> 05:02.401
really good.

05:02.434 --> 05:05.304
Better than I have in...

05:05.337 --> 05:07.607
forever.

05:07.640 --> 05:09.408
Okay, well, then good.

05:09.441 --> 05:11.811
I am so glad that you finally
found something that works.

05:11.844 --> 05:14.246
And if you do turn
into a lazy pothead,

05:14.279 --> 05:15.815
then you can always
be my house husband.

05:15.848 --> 05:18.951
Speaking of which,
let's do this.

05:20.385 --> 05:22.755
Nothing can slow me down,

05:22.788 --> 05:25.424
but who says that eating
on the run has to be boring?

05:25.457 --> 05:27.426
With Snack Hacker
snacker boxes,

05:27.459 --> 05:29.394
I get my daily recommended
allowance of fun.

05:35.467 --> 05:38.638
*

05:38.671 --> 05:40.239
(birds singing)

05:46.078 --> 05:50.683
* A wintery evening and vein 33
takes me back to the heart *

05:50.716 --> 05:53.853
(indistinct voice on video)
* The show's going to start!

05:53.886 --> 05:57.456
* Dodging the crux
of a highway stampede *

05:57.489 --> 06:00.159
* I make a break
for Liver Street *

06:00.192 --> 06:02.127
* Soon I'll be out
of the noose *

06:02.161 --> 06:06.465
* And forgetting
the life I lead *

06:06.498 --> 06:08.568
* Honey, I'm home,
hug applied, kisses blown *

06:08.601 --> 06:11.070
* And I conquer the den

06:11.103 --> 06:13.138
* Mine to defend

06:13.172 --> 06:16.742
* Traces of happier days
in the air *

06:16.776 --> 06:19.378
* A photograph,
a maiden fair *

06:19.411 --> 06:22.247
* Reach for the button
and nothing *

06:22.281 --> 06:23.983
* But memories disappear
(gasps)

06:24.016 --> 06:26.118
(whimpers)

06:28.721 --> 06:31.824
(grunting)

06:31.857 --> 06:33.458
(sighs)

06:41.567 --> 06:44.970
*

06:54.313 --> 06:56.749
(humming)

06:56.782 --> 07:01.587
* Ah, ah, ah, ah.

07:01.621 --> 07:03.122
(munching food)

07:03.155 --> 07:08.527
Mmm! Mm-hmm.

07:08.560 --> 07:11.063
Mmm!

07:11.096 --> 07:14.066
Mmm!
Will you knock it off

07:14.099 --> 07:17.069
and eat your goddamn
nachos like a person!

07:17.102 --> 07:18.437
What's wrong with you?

07:18.470 --> 07:19.772
My therapist said

07:19.805 --> 07:21.273
I have to practice mindfulness,

07:21.306 --> 07:24.376
so I am focusing
on the flavor of the food,

07:24.409 --> 07:28.648
the mouth feel, the swallowing,

07:28.681 --> 07:32.551
the reflecting...
on my swallowing.

07:32.584 --> 07:35.621
Jesus Christ, it's like
trying to eat an area rug.

07:35.655 --> 07:37.256
Eating slow?

07:37.289 --> 07:39.625
But less food in mouth.

07:39.659 --> 07:41.460
Did you know
that things your parents did

07:41.493 --> 07:44.730
when you were a kid
can affect you as an adult?

07:44.764 --> 07:47.266
What?! You mean time travel?

07:47.299 --> 07:49.134
Everything was a competition
with my mom--

07:49.168 --> 07:53.072
grades, tennis, who had a
lower BMI, even television.

07:53.105 --> 07:55.274
During Wheel,
she'd make me solve the puzzle

07:55.307 --> 07:56.976
before the contestants.

07:57.009 --> 08:00.145
All this time, I thought
my mom was scary but dope.

08:00.179 --> 08:01.847
Turns out
she wasn't dope at all.

08:01.881 --> 08:04.016
So she's not dope.
This morning

08:04.049 --> 08:05.851
I realized my entire life,

08:05.885 --> 08:07.820
I've had my mom's
judgey voice in my head.

08:07.853 --> 08:09.354
If I don't learn to replace it

08:09.388 --> 08:11.857
with something else mo' better,
I am screwed.

08:14.960 --> 08:16.628
(groans)
Oh!

08:16.662 --> 08:18.430
Hot! Hot!

08:18.463 --> 08:19.431
(softly):
Hot.

08:19.464 --> 08:20.432
(blows)

08:20.465 --> 08:21.433
Wait.

08:21.466 --> 08:23.769
No, no, no, no!

08:23.803 --> 08:27.106
That's what you get
for disrespecting nachos.

08:27.139 --> 08:29.008
Okay, so here's your pie flight,

08:29.041 --> 08:32.977
double cream lemon, KahlÃºa cream
cheese and chocolate satin.

08:33.011 --> 08:36.515
Aw, I'm eating for two
for the last time.

08:36.548 --> 08:38.717
Well, you had a good run.

08:38.751 --> 08:40.852
You ready, lady?
Yup.

08:40.885 --> 08:44.356
Let's go get this abobo.

08:44.389 --> 08:47.492
*

08:47.526 --> 08:49.528
(breathing heavily)

08:57.236 --> 08:59.671
Dad?

09:02.274 --> 09:04.276
Dad?

09:10.282 --> 09:13.318
(whispers):
He's gone.

09:13.352 --> 09:15.187
Yes!

09:16.221 --> 09:18.758
A toast to my triumph,

09:18.791 --> 09:22.762
my creation completed after
an honest day of manual labor,

09:22.795 --> 09:24.764
like the people.

09:24.797 --> 09:26.866
Like men.

09:29.434 --> 09:31.771
Thank you Herr Hammer.

09:31.804 --> 09:33.572
I could not have done it
without you.

09:33.605 --> 09:36.408
I'll meet you below for
a celebratory Pilsner shortly.

09:40.612 --> 09:42.414
Madame Level,

09:42.447 --> 09:44.349
you have been integral
to my success,

09:44.383 --> 09:47.219
from your green liquid
to your bubble.

09:47.252 --> 09:48.687
A bientot.

09:48.720 --> 09:51.623
(level clatters on ground)

09:51.656 --> 09:54.860
SeÃ±or... Drilly.

09:54.894 --> 09:57.629
(chuckles)
I counted on you most of all.

09:57.662 --> 09:58.898
Go.

09:58.931 --> 10:01.100
Enjoy a Campari on me.

10:01.133 --> 10:03.368
Ciao, amigo.

10:03.402 --> 10:04.603
(screams)

10:04.636 --> 10:06.605
(yells)

10:09.909 --> 10:14.579
(indistinct conversations)

10:14.613 --> 10:17.282
Oh, man, so many of the girls
that I coach are here.

10:17.316 --> 10:18.650
It's like if you dig
the student, you're really

10:18.683 --> 10:20.219
gonna love the master, right?

10:20.252 --> 10:22.387
You're gonna kill it.

10:22.421 --> 10:23.255
Hey, Dorothy.
Oh, hey.

10:23.288 --> 10:24.589
(quietly):
Hi.

10:24.623 --> 10:26.258
You signed in for
"Cute Yoga Girl,"

10:26.291 --> 10:28.460
but I think we got our wires
crossed with your agent.

10:28.493 --> 10:30.762
We were actually excited to
see you for "Overworked Mom."

10:30.796 --> 10:33.165
Oh, okay.
Great.

10:33.198 --> 10:35.500
Awesome. We have a bathrobe
you can just put on.

10:35.534 --> 10:36.802
Yeah.
Excellent.

10:38.470 --> 10:39.671
Uh...

10:39.704 --> 10:40.840
Hey, are you sure this is okay?

10:40.873 --> 10:42.441
You practiced the other one.

10:42.474 --> 10:44.109
Edgar, this kind of stuff
happens all the time.

10:44.143 --> 10:45.344
It's part of the biz.

10:45.377 --> 10:46.846
Okay, I'm gonna go
in the bathroom

10:46.879 --> 10:48.280
and rub off some of this
under eye concealer

10:48.313 --> 10:50.315
so I look super beat.

10:55.855 --> 10:57.656
MAN:
Hey.

10:57.689 --> 10:59.758
Do you need more weed?

10:59.791 --> 11:01.193
You're Dr. Weed, right?
Yeah.

11:01.226 --> 11:02.627
I'm Doug Benson.

11:02.661 --> 11:05.664
Oh, yeah, the, uh...
the pot comedy guy.

11:05.697 --> 11:07.833
Among other things,
but sure, that's the brand.

11:07.867 --> 11:09.034
Edgar Quintero.

11:09.068 --> 11:10.635
Super funny vids, man.

11:10.669 --> 11:11.837
Hey, you should swing by

11:11.871 --> 11:13.638
my "office" sometime.

11:13.672 --> 11:15.707
I've got a project I think
you might be interested in.

11:15.740 --> 11:17.542
Wow, uh, yeah.

11:17.576 --> 11:20.512
That... that would be great.

11:20.545 --> 11:22.514
So, what are you
auditioning for?

11:22.547 --> 11:25.817
Oh, I just nailed
the role of "Sleepy Dad."

11:25.851 --> 11:27.652
Hey, do you have a
diagnosis for my character?

11:27.686 --> 11:30.789
(Dr. Weed voice):
Hmm, my diagnosis is...

11:30.822 --> 11:34.659
you need more sleep.

11:34.693 --> 11:35.961
Just kidding.

11:35.995 --> 11:37.796
You need more weed!

11:37.829 --> 11:41.733
(laughs) Yeah, I thought that
was going to be the diagnosis.

11:50.175 --> 11:52.811
Why do cats get to have
all the good tongues?

11:52.844 --> 11:55.147
You sure you're okay
if I don't go in with you?

11:55.180 --> 11:57.416
I really have to do this
mediation app.
Sure.

11:57.449 --> 11:58.817
I'll go in alone.
They know me.

11:58.850 --> 12:00.185
Great, so, you'll be out in

12:00.219 --> 12:01.586
40, 45 minutes.
40, 45 minutes.

12:06.191 --> 12:07.426
(phone dings)

12:12.231 --> 12:13.465
(phone dings)

12:21.907 --> 12:24.776
(phone continues dinging)

12:24.809 --> 12:26.946
(chuckles)

12:39.624 --> 12:41.726
PAUL'S BOSS: And another thing,
Jillian, you are--

12:41.760 --> 12:43.762
Who are you texting?
PAUL: Can you hear him?

12:43.795 --> 12:45.897
He's yelling at me right now.

12:45.931 --> 12:49.468
Why can't I stop texting?
I guess I just miss you so much.

12:49.501 --> 12:50.769
Bye!
Give me that phone. Give...

12:50.802 --> 12:53.738
(recording stops)

12:58.910 --> 13:01.313
Difficult decision, huh?

13:02.681 --> 13:04.116
Yeah.

13:04.149 --> 13:05.817
Would you like to chat?

13:05.850 --> 13:08.220
Maybe I can help you figure
out some of your troubles.

13:08.253 --> 13:10.522
Thanks.

13:12.992 --> 13:15.727
So, what's bothering you?

13:15.760 --> 13:18.063
LINDSAY:
Well...

13:18.097 --> 13:19.498
it started when...

13:19.531 --> 13:21.433
All right.

13:21.466 --> 13:23.935
Let's do this shit.
(soothing music plays)

13:23.969 --> 13:26.571
WOMAN (soothing voice):
During this mediation

13:26.605 --> 13:28.273
we will focus on being...

13:28.307 --> 13:29.108
Mindful.

13:29.141 --> 13:30.142
...mindful,

13:30.175 --> 13:33.312
where you are not in the past,

13:33.345 --> 13:34.846
not in the future,

13:34.879 --> 13:36.281
but in...
Present.

13:36.315 --> 13:37.249
...the present.

13:37.282 --> 13:38.483
Easy. Next.

13:38.517 --> 13:41.020
Clear your mind
and focus on your...

13:41.053 --> 13:42.687
Breathing.

13:42.721 --> 13:43.655
Surroundings.

13:43.688 --> 13:44.523
Shit.

13:44.556 --> 13:46.158
And your breathing.

13:46.191 --> 13:47.426
Yes!
Suck it, lady.

13:47.459 --> 13:51.696
(slowly):
Notice the rise and fall

13:51.730 --> 13:54.633
of your chest.

13:54.666 --> 13:56.968
Notice the rise...

13:57.002 --> 14:00.805
Oh, God, so boring,
I want to kill myself.

14:00.839 --> 14:03.208
Eject, eject, eject.
(recording stops)

14:09.748 --> 14:11.416
(seductive music plays,
woman moaning)

14:14.886 --> 14:16.155
(buzzing)

14:16.188 --> 14:17.389
Edgar?

14:17.422 --> 14:18.657
Edgar!

14:18.690 --> 14:19.891
Where the hell is he?

14:19.924 --> 14:21.660
Sure, when I'm trying
to have sex

14:21.693 --> 14:24.229
in my kitchen, he's constantly
underfoot, but now...

14:28.100 --> 14:29.368
Trees.

14:31.103 --> 14:32.671
Trees.

14:32.704 --> 14:34.739
What if Pauline Two...

14:34.773 --> 14:36.641
no, I am not writing today.

14:36.675 --> 14:37.909
No, no, Malcolm!

14:37.942 --> 14:39.311
Shut up!

14:39.344 --> 14:41.446
Characters,
stop speaking through me.

14:45.850 --> 14:47.886
Oh, my God, chapter 12.
I could have Simon

14:47.919 --> 14:50.655
jump up on the speakers
at the Oasis set at Glastonbury.

14:50.689 --> 14:52.957
No, I am.... not-not doing this!

15:08.039 --> 15:13.078
Oh, Simon, you brilliant,
horny bastard.

15:13.112 --> 15:17.382
Suck it, Dad,
I'm still a writer.

15:17.416 --> 15:19.184
(buzzing)

15:19.218 --> 15:20.919
(buzzing stops)

15:22.787 --> 15:25.590
(sighs)

15:28.727 --> 15:31.296
Oh, no, not today.

15:31.330 --> 15:33.898
So then I heated up
the condom in the microwave

15:33.932 --> 15:36.601
and I got a turkey baster.
Wait, I need you to back up.

15:36.635 --> 15:39.037
Okay, so I wanted a popsicle...

15:39.070 --> 15:41.440
Lindsay, do not let those
pro-life assholes

15:41.473 --> 15:42.874
talk you out of
your legal right!

15:42.907 --> 15:44.109
It's okay.

15:44.143 --> 15:45.977
I was already having
second thoughts

15:46.010 --> 15:48.079
before this nice lady came over.

15:48.113 --> 15:49.080
What, why?

15:49.114 --> 15:50.982
If Paul and I get divorced,

15:51.015 --> 15:54.052
I'm not gonna have
a family anymore.

15:54.085 --> 15:55.454
Family.

15:55.487 --> 15:57.589
Name one family
that's just one person.

15:57.622 --> 15:59.591
Suddenly Susan.

15:59.624 --> 16:02.261
Listen, I know

16:02.294 --> 16:06.665
that becoming a real human being
is a scary thing,

16:06.698 --> 16:09.734
but I'll help you.

16:09.768 --> 16:12.304
I got your back always.

16:12.337 --> 16:14.773
Thanks, Gretch.

16:14.806 --> 16:16.107
All right.

16:17.142 --> 16:21.313
I'm ready.

16:21.346 --> 16:23.848
Bam, nice try, terrorists.

16:23.882 --> 16:25.950
Another victory
for women's rights.

16:27.118 --> 16:29.087
Actually, I was gonna
tell her to do it.

16:29.120 --> 16:31.490
In my book, there are
extenuating circumstances--

16:31.523 --> 16:33.692
rape, incest and...

16:33.725 --> 16:34.959
whatever this is.

16:43.134 --> 16:45.136
(indistinct chatter)

16:53.245 --> 16:55.880
Mr. Benson will see you now.

16:58.717 --> 17:01.152
No, no.

17:01.186 --> 17:03.121
Uh-uh. No.

17:03.154 --> 17:04.689
I'm walking away
from the table.

17:04.723 --> 17:06.958
I'll call you
from the chopper.

17:06.991 --> 17:08.292
Sorry, I had to handle that

17:08.327 --> 17:10.127
before the European
markets closed.

17:10.161 --> 17:12.631
This, um-- this place isn't
what I was expecting.

17:12.664 --> 17:14.866
Listen, I was looking at my
third quarter staffing budget

17:14.898 --> 17:16.501
and I'd like to offer you

17:16.535 --> 17:18.903
a few days punch up on a
show I'm doing for Waze.

17:18.936 --> 17:20.739
The GPS app?
Isn't that dangerous?

17:20.771 --> 17:22.173
You'd think so,

17:22.207 --> 17:23.474
but no, the show's
only gonna play

17:23.508 --> 17:25.076
at stop lights
and in traffic.

17:25.108 --> 17:27.311
So, what do you think
you should be paid?

17:27.346 --> 17:29.348
Uh...

17:31.082 --> 17:32.251
$300?

17:33.285 --> 17:34.986
Done.
Yes!

17:35.019 --> 17:35.987
(softly):
Yes.

17:36.020 --> 17:37.422
Hey, you want to, uh...

17:39.458 --> 17:41.326
light up and celebrate?

17:41.360 --> 17:43.462
Edgar, this is
a place of business.

17:45.597 --> 17:47.232
Thank you.

17:58.977 --> 18:01.112
You okay?

18:01.145 --> 18:02.347
What are you thinking about?

18:02.381 --> 18:03.882
Pie.

18:03.915 --> 18:06.084
You're thinking about

18:06.117 --> 18:07.352
what you're eating right now?

18:07.386 --> 18:09.220
Of course. If I'm eating pie,

18:09.254 --> 18:10.221
I'm thinking pie.

18:10.255 --> 18:11.723
If I have a fork in my mouth,

18:11.756 --> 18:13.592
I'm thinking fork.

18:13.625 --> 18:15.594
You just had an abortion,

18:15.627 --> 18:17.095
you're divorcing your husband,

18:17.128 --> 18:18.797
and you're literally
only thinking about

18:18.830 --> 18:20.064
what's happening in this moment?

18:20.098 --> 18:21.400
Guess so.

18:22.667 --> 18:23.802
Strawtini.

18:23.835 --> 18:25.103
You might be some kind of

18:25.136 --> 18:27.939
secret mindfulness guru.

18:27.972 --> 18:29.374
I'm gonna take notes.

18:29.408 --> 18:31.576
Just, uh,
speak your thoughts out, okay?

18:31.610 --> 18:34.279
Strawtini.

18:35.914 --> 18:37.482
Chew, chew,

18:37.516 --> 18:38.417
chew,

18:38.450 --> 18:39.250
little fart.

18:39.284 --> 18:41.085
Waitress is coming over.

18:41.119 --> 18:42.887
Here she is. Hi.

18:42.921 --> 18:44.323
Can I get you anything else?
Talking to me.

18:44.356 --> 18:45.256
Talking to me.

18:45.290 --> 18:46.591
My turn to talk.

18:46.625 --> 18:47.426
Neck mole,

18:47.459 --> 18:50.261
boobs.

18:50.295 --> 18:51.963
Bye, waitress.

18:51.996 --> 18:53.965
I miss her.

18:53.998 --> 18:55.266
Gretchen's still here.

18:55.300 --> 18:56.234
Hi, Gretchen.

18:56.267 --> 18:57.068
(chuckles)

18:57.101 --> 18:58.069
Baby ears.

18:58.102 --> 18:59.338
Ooh,

18:59.371 --> 19:01.473
a hang nail.

19:01.506 --> 19:03.141
Pie again.

19:07.979 --> 19:10.682
(laughing)

19:10.715 --> 19:12.617
Oh!

19:12.651 --> 19:15.019
Sto...
Hey.

19:15.053 --> 19:16.588
I had such a productive day.

19:16.621 --> 19:18.457
I just made $80 cleaning out

19:18.490 --> 19:20.992
this rich old lady's closet
in Beverly Hills.

19:21.025 --> 19:22.293
Awesome.
It is.

19:22.327 --> 19:23.762
I have good news, too.

19:23.795 --> 19:25.930
Ooh, did Jimmy make
you buy more of those

19:25.964 --> 19:27.165
disgusting candies
that I like?

19:27.198 --> 19:29.033
Rum Christophers?
(groans)

19:29.067 --> 19:30.502
No.

19:30.535 --> 19:32.637
I got offered a job,

19:32.671 --> 19:35.940
writing for
Doug Benson's new show.

19:35.974 --> 19:37.442
Wait, what?

19:37.476 --> 19:38.877
Really?
Yeah.

19:38.910 --> 19:41.145
You got a job writing comedy
for a TV show?

19:41.179 --> 19:43.181
Yeah. I mean,
it's a short-term gig

19:43.214 --> 19:44.983
a-and there are a ton of
liability waivers

19:45.016 --> 19:46.618
I have to sign, but still.

19:46.651 --> 19:48.186
Wow, wow.

19:48.219 --> 19:50.555
That's-- you know that
I know Doug, right?

19:50.589 --> 19:51.856
Did you tell him
that we're dating?

19:51.890 --> 19:53.458
No, I didn't know you knew him.

19:53.492 --> 19:55.727
Oh, yeah, for years.

19:55.760 --> 19:57.396
Like, way back when he was
doing his show at the theater,

19:57.429 --> 19:58.730
I used to bring him waters.

19:58.763 --> 20:00.198
I can't believe that
you didn't know

20:00.231 --> 20:01.299
that I know Doug.

20:01.332 --> 20:02.501
You totally should've told him.

20:02.534 --> 20:04.536
He would have lost his mind.

20:04.569 --> 20:06.571
Anyway, congratulations.

20:06.605 --> 20:08.973
That is so cool

20:09.007 --> 20:10.742
that he's giving you
this opportunity.

20:10.775 --> 20:12.477
I... I mean,

20:12.511 --> 20:13.712
I thought you didn't
want to be a pot guy.

20:13.745 --> 20:14.713
I don't.

20:14.746 --> 20:16.147
But now I'm a pot guy

20:16.180 --> 20:17.982
with a J-O-B.

20:18.016 --> 20:19.884
Can you believe it?

20:19.918 --> 20:21.753
I'm a comedy writer!

20:22.787 --> 20:24.556
I totally can't.
And...

20:24.589 --> 20:26.357
I couldn't...

20:26.391 --> 20:28.560
have ever done it...

20:28.593 --> 20:30.429
without you, teach.

20:30.462 --> 20:33.331
How about I go upstairs

20:33.364 --> 20:35.734
and I... (kisses)

20:35.767 --> 20:40.171
whip us up some of my famous
breakfast soup dumplings?

20:40.204 --> 20:43.074
Ooh, I love that.

20:43.107 --> 20:45.810
Ah!
I'll be right up.

20:54.052 --> 20:56.455
*

21:10.502 --> 21:12.937
*

21:26.685 --> 21:28.687
(sighs)

21:32.791 --> 21:36.127
Everything looks so different
from up here.

21:43.502 --> 21:45.870
(dog panting)

21:55.547 --> 21:57.148
(crickets chirping)

22:02.887 --> 22:05.824
*

22:28.713 --> 22:30.481
Walk.

22:30.515 --> 22:32.884
(exhales)

22:32.917 --> 22:35.053
Couch.

22:40.058 --> 22:41.526
Remote.

22:42.527 --> 22:43.895
PAT SAJAK:
Uh-huh, there is a "J."

22:43.928 --> 22:45.063
If you can solve the puzzle
right now...

22:45.096 --> 22:46.164
Wheel.

22:46.197 --> 22:48.700
...there is a jackpot
of nearly $10,000

22:48.733 --> 22:49.834
in addition to
the money you have.

22:49.868 --> 22:51.135
If not, you have to either

22:51.169 --> 22:52.704
buy a vowel or spin the wheel.

22:52.737 --> 22:53.838
I'll solve the puzzle.
Go ahead.

22:53.872 --> 22:56.140
"I Have The Wine"
by Johnny Cash.

22:56.174 --> 22:57.976
Oh, my God, you are so...

22:58.009 --> 22:59.043
That is not correct.
(buzzer sounds)

22:59.077 --> 23:01.580
Nope, just watch.

23:01.613 --> 23:03.481
Jason.

23:03.514 --> 23:05.483
Wheel. B.
(wheel spinning)

23:05.516 --> 23:07.919
Breathe.

23:07.952 --> 23:10.855
(applause)
JASON: "L," please.

23:10.889 --> 23:12.490
SAJAK: Yes, two "L's."
(ding)

23:12.523 --> 23:14.626
Pick up that gift tag...

23:17.629 --> 23:20.064
CALM FEMALE VOICE:
Notice...

23:20.098 --> 23:22.867
the rise...

23:22.901 --> 23:27.572
and fall of your chest.

23:27.606 --> 23:28.573
(door opens)

23:28.607 --> 23:31.242
Hey.

23:31.275 --> 23:32.510
Good news.

23:32.543 --> 23:33.978
I'm hella mindful now.

23:35.313 --> 23:36.881
Why are you covered in yard?

23:36.915 --> 23:39.383
I did what you said.

23:39.417 --> 23:42.353
I looked at my life from
an outside perspective.

23:42.386 --> 23:43.354
Yeah.

23:43.387 --> 23:44.422
Doesn't it feel great?

23:44.455 --> 23:46.958
No, it was terrifying.

23:46.991 --> 23:48.760
I didn't recognize any of it.

23:48.793 --> 23:49.794
What?

23:49.828 --> 23:52.030
I don't recognize my life.

23:52.063 --> 23:55.566
I don't know whether I made
any of the right decisions.

23:57.969 --> 24:01.305
Everything could be wrong.

24:01.339 --> 24:02.573
Everything?

24:05.810 --> 24:08.012
Everything.

24:19.423 --> 24:21.259
(applause)
(wheel spinning)

24:21.292 --> 24:25.263
It's "I Walk the Line."

24:25.296 --> 24:26.497
SAJAK:
What do you want to do?

24:26.530 --> 24:29.567
* All I want is

24:29.600 --> 24:33.437
* A pair of wings to fly

24:33.471 --> 24:36.107
* Into the blue of

24:36.140 --> 24:39.243
* The wide open sky

24:39.277 --> 24:43.314
* Show me your scars

24:43.347 --> 24:46.317
* I'll show you mine

24:46.350 --> 24:48.753
* Perched out of the city

24:48.787 --> 24:53.658
* On a pair of power lines

24:53.692 --> 24:58.229
* On clouds I'll sing
and dance... *

24:59.497 --> 25:02.466
(dog barks)

25:05.503 --> 25:08.406
