LORNE: A mystical pregnancy
right under my beak?

00:31.093 --> 00:34.881
Having two part-demon parents
might explain the "whoosh" factor.

00:35.053 --> 00:39.922
Connor, before our baby comes, I might
ask you to do some things for us.

00:40.093 --> 00:43.563

All this time...

01:01.973 --> 01:04.407
...it was you, wasn't it?

01:04.572 --> 01:08.248
Took you long enough to figure it out.
But nice turn with the Lorne bait.

01:08.533 --> 01:10.922
There was a time
I would have seen that one coming...

01:11.093 --> 01:13.891
...eons before it ever crossed
your tiny little mind.

01:14.053 --> 01:18.171
- Because you're so clever.
- On a scale of you to me? Pretty damn.

01:18.773 --> 01:22.004
- Until now.
- All good things.

01:30.653 --> 01:32.848
...my sweet baby.

01:33.133 --> 01:34.486
"My sweet."

01:34.653 --> 01:36.848
Same phrase the Beastmaster
kept using...

01:37.013 --> 01:39.288
...when he was whispering
in Angelus' head.

01:40.053 --> 01:42.806

her friends like this.

- Beastmaster.

- You think she's working for him?
- She is the master.

...confused. Again.

Now we know what she's been doing
all this time. She was grooming him.

04:27.813 --> 04:29.087
As her champion.

04:29.813 --> 04:32.930
She's the evil genius that's been
two-stepping all over us.

04:33.093 --> 04:34.970
How? And when?

04:35.453 --> 04:37.011
And give me a sip of that.

04:37.173 --> 04:40.722
Has she been like this since she
got back from that higher wherever?

04:40.893 --> 04:42.485
And what about that amnesia thing?

04:42.653 --> 04:44.962
- Was that a fake out?
- Or a side effect.

04:45.133 --> 04:48.125
Descending to a lower dimension
was probably disorienting.

04:48.293 --> 04:53.686
Maybe this thing was curled deep inside
for the trip on some kind of autopilot.

04:53.853 --> 04:57.562
All we know for sure is the real damage
didn't start until after Lorne's spell.

05:02.253 --> 05:03.652
Oh, my God.

sucked out of my noodle.

have done, it was this thing.

<i>snuck into the vault, killed Manny.</i>

07:13.893 --> 07:15.770
I didn't know where you were.

07:15.933 --> 07:19.608
I thought something bad might have
happened. I followed your scent.

07:19.773 --> 07:21.923
But I never thought...

07:22.613 --> 07:23.966
How could he do that?

07:25.093 --> 07:26.970
Because he hates you.

07:30.053 --> 07:32.521
I didn't want to believe it...

07:33.173 --> 07:34.765
...but he does.

07:35.733 --> 07:39.487
He hates you for being with me.

07:41.413 --> 07:44.803
He can't stand the fact that he lost.

07:45.653 --> 07:48.565
That he'll never know the feel
of my touch...

07:49.733 --> 07:52.167
...or the warmth of my lips.

08:02.573 --> 08:04.643
You were right about Angel.

08:06.053 --> 08:07.805
He's an animal.

08:09.253 --> 08:11.813
And he's turned everyone against us.

08:20.013 --> 08:22.891

08:29.933 --> 08:31.764
I swept the area until daybreak.

08:31.933 --> 08:34.493
Checked the sewer tunnels
in case they went underground.

08:34.653 --> 08:37.008
Picked up their scent
half a dozen times, but...

08:37.173 --> 08:40.006
If Connor doesn't wanna be found,
he won't.

08:40.732 --> 08:42.371
Wasting your time.

08:42.732 --> 08:45.042
I'm getting good at that.

08:46.893 --> 08:48.770
It was all there.

08:49.053 --> 08:51.089
Right in front of me.

08:51.613 --> 08:53.012
And I couldn't see it.

08:53.613 --> 08:57.128
- The thought of losing her to Connor...
- Did exactly what it was supposed to.

08:57.693 --> 09:01.208
Play on your emotions
to cloud your judgment.

09:01.373 --> 09:07.687
Draw your attention away so this thing
could continue to murder anyone.

09:09.573 --> 09:12.451
At least you had a reason
for letting it happen.

09:13.773 --> 09:15.411
Wes.

09:16.253 --> 09:19.609
- Lilah and I weren't exactly friends...
- You were mortal enemies.

09:20.573 --> 09:22.484
Why should you care
what happened to her?

09:23.253 --> 09:24.971
Because you did.

09:31.293 --> 09:33.204
There's nothing here.

09:33.373 --> 09:37.082
If this thing could obliterate
all references to the Beast...

09:37.253 --> 09:40.165
...it's very unlikely it would
leave its own bio laying about.

09:40.333 --> 09:42.893
What about pan-dimensional texts,
like the one Lilah...

09:46.493 --> 09:49.769
I have Lorne reaching out to
the black markets, but it'll take time.

09:49.933 --> 09:52.003
Great. Another thing we don't have.

09:52.173 --> 09:53.925
Then let's go to the source.

09:54.093 --> 09:55.572
Whatever happened to Cordelia...

09:55.733 --> 09:58.327
...took place after her ascension
to the higher planes.

09:58.493 --> 10:01.485
- Maybe the Powers might...
- Last couple of times I asked them...

10:01.653 --> 10:04.804
...for help, they made it damn clear
they weren't in the business.

10:04.973 --> 10:07.203
At least one of those
was to save Darla's life...

10:07.373 --> 10:13.164
...a mass-murdering, ex-vampire dying
of syphilis. A strong "no" is not a shock.

10:13.333 --> 10:16.564
You think the Powers couldn't see
this thing was masquerading as Cordy?

10:16.733 --> 10:18.325
What it was doing to us?

10:18.653 --> 10:21.850
They didn't stop it, because they
didn't wanna get their hands dirty.

10:25.293 --> 10:26.965
What we need...

10:27.133 --> 10:29.408
...is somebody who does.

10:29.573 --> 10:32.246
Somebody right in the middle
of all this.

10:36.413 --> 10:38.290

More hooks.

10:38.453 --> 10:39.727
Great.

10:40.293 --> 10:43.649
- We could try to find someplace else.
- No.

10:43.853 --> 10:45.366
This will do for now.

Hey, it's okay.
We're gonna be all right.

10:50.773 --> 10:53.082
I know. I just...

10:54.013 --> 10:56.573
I can't believe he tried to kill you.

10:58.733 --> 11:00.485
Maybe it wasn't really Angel.

11:00.653 --> 11:02.689
- Connor.
- Angelus could've tricked us again.

11:02.853 --> 11:06.402
It was Angel. You know it was.

11:09.453 --> 11:11.523
Everything he said.

11:12.493 --> 11:16.452
About how I could help
make the world a better place.

11:18.413 --> 11:20.688
About being a champion.

11:32.893 --> 11:35.691
...Gunn, Wesley, even Lorne.

11:35.853 --> 11:37.730
I thought they were...

11:39.693 --> 11:42.491
...good.
- What does that mean?

11:42.653 --> 11:47.408
Really. Being good,
doing the right thing?

11:48.013 --> 11:49.412
By whose judgment?

11:52.013 --> 11:54.573
Good. Evil.

11:54.733 --> 11:56.928
They're just words, Connor.

11:57.973 --> 12:01.852
Concepts of morality
they've forced around your neck...

12:02.013 --> 12:04.322
...to yank you wherever they please.

12:05.453 --> 12:07.603
You're with me now.

12:07.853 --> 12:10.162
You don't have to live by their rules.

12:11.533 --> 12:13.569
You remember why?

12:15.973 --> 12:19.045
- Because we're special.
- That's right.

12:19.293 --> 12:21.204
We're special.

12:21.693 --> 12:23.604

12:23.933 --> 12:26.322

A bunch of candles, a couple
of broken pieces of the Muo-ping...

12:32.493 --> 12:36.725
...and some toiletries that smell
way too pretty to be evil.

12:37.573 --> 12:42.647
Not much to go on. As insidious liars
go, it kept Cordy's room nice and tidy.

12:42.813 --> 12:45.373
- It even vacuumed.
- Keep working on locating this thing.

12:45.533 --> 12:49.128
- Lf I'm not back in a couple of hours...
- You're dead, we're screwed, world ends.

Here's nice.

- She told me you were her guide...

to become half-demon.

has ascended to a higher plane.

- Back?

- Wait. No one comes back from paradise.

Oh, it was beautiful.

27:19.253 --> 27:22.609
...to make one possible.
- That's what the kid was designed for.

27:22.773 --> 27:24.968
- To sleep with Mother Love?
- To create a vessel.

Look out, the monkey's thinking again.

27:27.293 --> 27:30.842
Being in a human makes it vulnerable.
That's why it had to stay hidden.

stronger to pour itself into.

SKIP: Sure.

- Couple of pokes in the...
- A way that won't kill her in the process.

27:56.173 --> 27:59.449
Takes a whole lot of cramming to get
that much sweetness into a human.

27:59.653 --> 28:03.202
It's in every hair, every cell,
every molecule of Cordelia's body.

28:03.373 --> 28:06.126
And it ain't letting go until
it got a brand-new bag.

28:06.293 --> 28:08.045
What happens to Cordy then?

28:08.253 --> 28:12.087
Drained of her life force during labor.
Those contractions are a real bitch.

- How?
- Well, I'd go with the Bu'shundi Ritual...

28:30.653 --> 28:33.645
...but you're gonna need
a sacred Hutamin paw for that.

28:33.813 --> 28:35.531
- Got it!
- What?

28:35.693 --> 28:38.253
Cordy, the real Cordy,
kept one in her desk drawer.

28:38.413 --> 28:41.723
Probably a knockoff. It's not some
trinket you throw in a desk drawer.
