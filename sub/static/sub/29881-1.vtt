I'm like Grandpa, not for me.

11:47.207 --> 11:48.206
DODGE: Yeah.

11:48.208 --> 11:49.441
That's 'cause she
listens to you.

11:49.443 --> 11:50.241
Hey.

11:50.243 --> 11:51.376
JACKIE: Wait.

11:51.378 --> 11:53.378
My love, my baby,
how was therapy?

11:53.380 --> 11:55.413
Did you talk about me?

11:55.415 --> 11:57.182
You want to check this out?

11:57.184 --> 12:00.251
I think this is a little
more what you were going for.

12:00.253 --> 12:03.088
You obviously will be tweaking
it at The Fellowship, but just,

12:03.090 --> 12:05.290
you know, for the purposes
of getting it in today--

12:08.261 --> 12:10.662
I don't want a bunch of
hacks changing my work.

12:15.368 --> 12:17.402
They're just
giving you feedback.

12:17.404 --> 12:20.605
I don't want
any more feedback.

12:20.607 --> 12:22.540
Can you focus on the
fact that this gives you

12:22.542 --> 12:27.879
a guaranteed premiere and a
real run at their theater?

12:27.881 --> 12:32.650
I have a theater,
an incredible theater.

12:32.652 --> 12:34.452
Tennessee Williams
sat on my stage.

12:34.454 --> 12:36.054
RACHEL: Yeah.

12:36.056 --> 12:40.391
The Montgomery has a built-in
audience, that's all this is.

12:40.393 --> 12:43.628
You've written a
really good play, Dad.

12:43.630 --> 12:45.029
People deserve to see your play.

12:51.471 --> 12:53.271
And they want you to
say something tonight

12:53.273 --> 12:54.038
about your work.

12:56.810 --> 12:58.009
They do?

12:58.011 --> 12:59.043
RACHEL: Yeah.

13:13.794 --> 13:15.660
Here.

13:15.662 --> 13:16.427
You work on that.

13:20.000 --> 13:24.169
Am I good to type this
up and turn it in?

13:24.171 --> 13:25.003
Yeah, yeah.

13:25.005 --> 13:26.538
It's fine.

13:26.540 --> 13:27.338
OK.

13:30.177 --> 13:31.609
[music playing]

13:31.611 --> 13:33.978
JACKIE: Here we are at the
world's greatest theater.

13:33.980 --> 13:37.215
And here we are with the
world's greatest playwright.

13:37.217 --> 13:38.850
He's walking up the stairs.

13:38.852 --> 13:40.151
He's loving his life.

13:40.153 --> 13:41.219
He's doing-- oh, my god.

13:41.221 --> 13:42.053
Dad.
MEL: Woo!

13:42.055 --> 13:42.887
JACKIE: Dad!
- Whoa!

13:42.889 --> 13:43.721
JACKIE: Dad!
- Dad!

13:43.723 --> 13:44.522
Help me!

13:44.524 --> 13:46.524
Help me sir, please.

13:46.526 --> 13:48.226
Help me.
- Oh, I don't know this man.

13:48.228 --> 13:49.327
I'm so sorry.
MEL: My god.

13:49.329 --> 13:50.295
I'm sorry.
He's fine.

13:50.297 --> 13:51.062
I'm so sorry.

13:51.064 --> 13:52.363
MEL: Have you no feelings?

13:52.365 --> 13:53.131
Let's do that again.

13:56.870 --> 13:58.203
What, do I got dandruff?

13:58.205 --> 13:59.037
No.

13:59.039 --> 14:00.038
You just have some fuzz.

14:00.040 --> 14:01.873
I got to go over my speech.

14:01.875 --> 14:03.374
How long is it?

14:03.376 --> 14:08.680
Just-- just out of curiosity.

14:08.682 --> 14:10.014
Do you want to read it?

14:10.016 --> 14:11.182
Do you want me to read it?

14:11.184 --> 14:12.817
Mel Gurner.

14:12.819 --> 14:16.020
I am such a fan of
"The Way I See It."

14:16.022 --> 14:17.889
Such elegant writing.

14:17.891 --> 14:19.324
(SINGING) There
is an open bar.

14:19.326 --> 14:20.258
Two for you.
Hi.

14:20.260 --> 14:21.659
Two for you.

14:21.661 --> 14:22.527
Going to get me one.

14:22.529 --> 14:23.561
These are my daughters.

14:23.563 --> 14:24.662
No, Jackie.

14:24.664 --> 14:25.997
WOMAN: A-ha.

14:25.999 --> 14:29.067
I knew there was a reason
you wrote women so well.

14:29.069 --> 14:30.568
Have you met everyone?

14:30.570 --> 14:31.936
No.

14:31.938 --> 14:33.605
WOMAN: We are so happy
you're bringing a little age

14:33.607 --> 14:36.207
diversity into the group.

14:36.209 --> 14:39.410
We, the
underrepresented majority,

14:39.412 --> 14:42.580
will no longer be
pushed to the margins.

14:42.582 --> 14:45.383
Because we are the
future of theater.

14:45.385 --> 14:48.319
[applause]

14:57.797 --> 15:01.432
You may know, our next
fellow from his groundbreaking

15:01.434 --> 15:06.938
performance in the 1971 Broadway
production of "A Doll's House."

15:06.940 --> 15:12.076
But tonight we're celebrating
his more recent accomplishment

15:12.078 --> 15:14.112
as a playwright.

15:14.114 --> 15:17.882
Please welcome Mel Gurner.

15:17.884 --> 15:20.785
[applause]

15:42.008 --> 15:44.275
(SINGING) Gee, I'm great.

15:44.277 --> 15:46.477
Gee, I'm grand.

15:46.479 --> 15:49.881
Pat me on the back
and shake my hand.

[sparse applause]

16:19.312 --> 16:22.180

16:23.683 --> 16:25.683
RACHEL: It reflects
really badly on me.

16:25.685 --> 16:26.818
JACKIE: Yeah, I get that.

16:26.820 --> 16:29.020
But I really think
you're overreacting.

16:29.022 --> 16:30.688
Who the fuck does
he think he is?

16:30.690 --> 16:32.824
My recent accomplishment
as a playwright?

16:32.826 --> 16:34.459
How about mentioning
the other 50 plays

16:34.461 --> 16:35.660
I wrote and produced myself.

16:35.662 --> 16:37.328
Which nobody saw
or cares about.

16:37.330 --> 16:39.397
Me thinks I have [inaudible]
Coward, you coward.

16:39.399 --> 16:41.199
DODGE: I'm a coward.
MEL: You're a coward?

16:41.201 --> 16:42.567
- I'm a coward!
- You're a coward?

16:42.569 --> 16:43.401
I'm a coward!

16:43.403 --> 16:44.635
You're a coward?

16:44.637 --> 16:49.474
Oh, my beauty, they're
bound to recast you.

16:49.476 --> 16:50.842
You don't know that.

16:50.844 --> 16:52.577
MEL: We don't need the
circle jerk players theater.

16:52.579 --> 16:53.544
We own a theater.

16:53.546 --> 16:54.979
That we need to
be renting out.

16:54.981 --> 16:56.748
MEL: I'm sick of
pimping this place out.

16:56.750 --> 16:58.216
It's my play.

16:58.218 --> 17:00.084
We're doing it at my theater.

17:00.086 --> 17:03.087
With what money?

17:03.089 --> 17:06.223
Have a little imagination,
Rachel, for Christ's sake.

17:06.226 --> 17:09.027
Imagination's not
really Rachel's thing.

17:09.029 --> 17:10.828
Rachel is more of
a logic guy, dad.

17:10.829 --> 17:12.497
Can we not fight please?

17:12.499 --> 17:14.898
This was actually
almost something real.

17:14.901 --> 17:16.768
MEL: (SINGING) It's my play.

17:16.770 --> 17:18.569
It's my play.

17:18.570 --> 17:20.104
Don't rewrite a word I say.
OK?

17:20.106 --> 17:21.105
OK.
OK?

17:21.107 --> 17:21.906
OK.
OK.

17:21.907 --> 17:23.508
OK.
OK.

17:23.510 --> 17:24.709
OK.

17:24.711 --> 17:25.510
OK.

17:25.512 --> 17:26.344
OK.

17:26.346 --> 17:27.412
OK.

17:27.414 --> 17:28.146
OK.

17:35.021 --> 17:36.921
Why do you care so much?

17:36.923 --> 17:38.389
I don't know.

17:38.391 --> 17:39.557
Huh?

17:39.559 --> 17:40.324
I don't know.

17:45.098 --> 17:46.364
It's my play.

17:51.304 --> 17:52.520
It's my play.

17:52.521 --> 17:53.737
I should be able to do
whatever I want with it.

17:53.740 --> 17:54.539
Right?

17:54.541 --> 17:56.841
[music playing]

18:02.382 --> 18:03.314
You disagree?

18:10.457 --> 18:12.223
Inserting yourself
into the process

18:12.225 --> 18:13.858
does not make you a playwright.

18:16.729 --> 18:19.230
You're very good stage manager.

18:19.232 --> 18:20.298
Be happy about that.

18:25.805 --> 18:28.773
I don't really care about
your stupid fucking play.

18:28.775 --> 18:31.409
I just need you to have a life
so that I can finally have one.

18:38.751 --> 18:42.220
I didn't realize
this wasn't a life.

18:49.329 --> 18:51.996
We're doing the show here.

18:51.998 --> 18:53.598

be a part of it.

rehearse right now?

where I put in the knife.

- Get up now, Daddy.

It's OK, baby.

Don't touch him, baby.

- Dad, get up.

Rachel, help me get him up.

I don't think he's breathing.
He just slumped over.

I don't know what happened.
Help me get him up!

Cool.

You can get him set up and

Hi, lovely to meet you.

We're a little too far.
It's a little awkward.

- Not a problem.
- Right?

21:33.259 --> 21:34.325
Let's admit it.

closing on a new car.

Super fast.

I hope you don't mind me showing
up instead of my old man.

You see, you probably weren't
expecting such a young guy.

This is the will?

What co-owner?

22:25.178 --> 22:26.377
Yeah, what?

22:26.379 --> 22:28.079
Our dad is the sole
owner of our building.

22:28.081 --> 22:28.913
No.

Co-owner was Sharon Gurner.

She's dead.

22:44.063 --> 22:44.995
Yeah.

22:44.997 --> 22:48.199
Sherrell Gerhart
is the co-owner.

22:48.201 --> 22:49.367
OK.

22:49.369 --> 22:51.102
MICHAEL: Sounds French,
Sherrell Gerhart.

22:51.104 --> 22:52.069
Excuse me.

22:52.071 --> 22:53.471
OK, taking charge.

22:58.010 --> 23:00.511
Why is a soap actress
listed as the co-owner

23:00.513 --> 23:01.412
of our building?

23:04.217 --> 23:07.151
[music playing]

23:11.224 --> 23:12.223
JACKIE: Let me do it.

23:12.225 --> 23:13.157
Let me do it.

23:18.231 --> 23:20.931
Please, god, let him live.

23:20.933 --> 23:22.700
JACKIE: [chuckle] Oh, my god.

23:22.702 --> 23:24.769
You know who she
kind of looks like?

23:24.771 --> 23:26.103
Looks a lot like you.

23:26.105 --> 23:28.105
We should go.
We'll get to the bottom of this.

23:28.107 --> 23:29.106
Thank you.
JACKIE: Wait.

23:29.108 --> 23:30.408
Why would Dad--
RACHEL: Jackie.

23:30.410 --> 23:32.443
--co-own a building
with this woman?

23:32.445 --> 23:35.212
[music playing]

23:44.757 --> 23:46.390
RACHEL: Why don't you
remember anything?

23:46.392 --> 23:47.391
I was four, Rach.

23:47.393 --> 23:48.426
We had a funeral.

23:48.428 --> 23:49.727
Was I suppose to
know that was fake?

23:49.729 --> 23:50.728
You mean this?

23:50.729 --> 23:51.728
You mean us dressed in
black at Coney Island?

23:51.731 --> 23:53.164
- OK, whatever.
- Where are you going?

23:53.166 --> 23:54.465
We're this way.

23:54.466 --> 23:55.765
No. Those soap citiers
are on the West Side.

23:55.768 --> 23:58.135
You want to meet
her right now?

23:58.137 --> 23:59.136
- Yes.
- No.

23:59.138 --> 24:00.004
We're not doing that.

24:00.006 --> 24:01.071
- I'm doing that.
- Nope.

24:01.073 --> 24:01.972
We are not.
- Ow.

24:01.974 --> 24:02.807
Stay.

24:02.809 --> 24:04.775
Come on.

24:04.777 --> 24:05.676
Look at me.

24:08.981 --> 24:10.915
She owns our building.

24:10.917 --> 24:13.150
I know.

24:13.152 --> 24:16.320
As far as we know, she doesn't
know that Dad's dead yet.

24:16.322 --> 24:19.323
We don't know what she'll do.

24:19.325 --> 24:21.692
She might want to sell it.

24:21.694 --> 24:24.161
She might want us out of there.

24:24.163 --> 24:26.997
We don't know her.

24:26.999 --> 24:27.898
She's our mother.

24:31.204 --> 24:33.437
Don't you think if she
thought of herself that way,

24:33.439 --> 24:34.572
we would have met her by now?

24:38.344 --> 24:39.276
I don't know.

24:43.716 --> 24:44.682
Let's get a drink.

24:44.684 --> 24:45.416
You want a drink?

24:48.621 --> 24:49.620
Yeah.

24:49.622 --> 24:50.554
Do you want one?

24:50.556 --> 24:51.689
Yeah.

24:51.691 --> 24:54.391
[music playing]

24:55.361 --> 24:56.327
We got to tell Dodge.

24:56.329 --> 24:57.495
No.

24:57.497 --> 24:59.230
Please promise me we won't
tell Dodge about this.

24:59.232 --> 25:00.664
[sigh]

25:00.666 --> 25:02.933
Promise me.

25:02.935 --> 25:05.269
I take it you
didn't like the will?

25:05.271 --> 25:06.770
You have a grandmother.

25:06.772 --> 25:08.005
The will was fine.

25:08.007 --> 25:10.374
Should we watch a
movie or something?

25:10.376 --> 25:11.175
Yeah, sure.

25:11.177 --> 25:12.243
OK.

25:12.245 --> 25:13.577
Why don't you set
up the projector?

25:13.579 --> 25:14.512
OK.

25:14.514 --> 25:15.279
Great.

25:30.763 --> 25:32.162
This was grandpa's
favorite part.

25:35.701 --> 25:36.901
What?

25:36.903 --> 25:37.635
Nothing.

Hey, this is Charles.

26:45.037 --> 26:45.836
Are you here?

26:45.838 --> 26:47.171
Yes.

26:47.173 --> 26:48.005
Yeah, I'm coming.

26:48.007 --> 26:49.173
I'm on my way out.

26:49.175 --> 26:50.541
Thanks.

26:50.543 --> 26:51.609
Dodge, you got to get up.

26:51.611 --> 26:53.177
The new accountant's here.

26:53.179 --> 26:54.678
Baby, you got to wake up.

26:54.680 --> 26:55.479
I'm so sorry.

26:55.481 --> 26:56.780
Come on.
I know.

26:56.782 --> 26:57.681
I know.

26:57.683 --> 26:58.482
OK.

26:58.484 --> 27:01.552
I'll get your pants.

27:01.554 --> 27:03.387
Can you hold these
for me, please?

I'm Rachel.

Hi.

27:09.562 --> 27:11.028
Nice to meet you.

27:11.030 --> 27:13.063
Dodge, Charles is helping
us out with some accounting

27:13.065 --> 27:15.299
to figure out how we can
afford to do Grandpa's play.

27:15.301 --> 27:16.634
I left my dad's
financials in the office.

27:16.636 --> 27:18.202
If you can't find
anything, just ask her.

27:18.204 --> 27:18.836
She grew up here.

27:18.838 --> 27:20.404
I'll be back in a bit.

27:23.042 --> 27:25.676
Cool.

27:25.678 --> 27:26.443
Cool.

27:37.256 --> 27:40.391
Uh, it's locked.

27:40.393 --> 27:41.392
Um--

27:41.394 --> 27:42.192
Seriously?

27:42.194 --> 27:44.395
I don't have my--

27:44.397 --> 27:46.263
ooh, my key.

27:46.265 --> 27:49.133
Uh, we could try breaking in.

27:51.904 --> 27:52.770
No, no, no, no, no.

27:52.772 --> 27:54.705

I see you.

28:22.234 --> 28:23.734
Jackie!

28:23.736 --> 28:25.803
You do not want to
meet this woman.

28:25.805 --> 28:27.371
If you tell them
you are, you're just

28:27.373 --> 28:29.406
going to sound like a crazy fan.

28:29.408 --> 28:30.207
I know!

28:30.209 --> 28:31.442
I'm not crazy!

28:31.444 --> 28:33.110
You're jeopardizing our
home and our business.

28:33.112 --> 28:34.912
Hi.
We need to be closing right now.

28:34.914 --> 28:36.080
Do not go in there.
Jackie!

28:36.082 --> 28:36.980
Yeah.

I've got RKO banging
down my door.

Well, if she's on uppers,
then put her on some downers.

- You know what I mean?

28:41.887 --> 28:42.886
I'm a producer.

- Who do I have to t--

28:47.727 --> 28:48.492
It's OK.

28:48.494 --> 28:51.729
We're leaving right now.

28:51.731 --> 28:53.163
I'll call you back.

28:57.136 --> 28:58.635
OK.

28:58.637 --> 29:01.638
What is your name, ma'am?

How is it pronounced?

I'm sorry.

Thank you.

29:12.351 --> 29:14.785
Where's is your metro card?

29:14.787 --> 29:17.087
Well, I'd say we could
just flirt our way in,

29:17.089 --> 29:19.790
but you decided to dress like
a Mennonite caterer today.

29:19.792 --> 29:22.526
And that's not going
to work, is it?

29:22.528 --> 29:27.131
Buddy, I know that you're
processing a lot right now.

29:27.133 --> 29:28.265
Yes.

I just don't want
you to get arrested.

Well, then help me.

I'm trying.

29:33.272 --> 29:35.773
I promise you if after
talking about this

29:35.775 --> 29:37.941
and getting a little more
information you still want

29:37.943 --> 29:39.710
to meet her, I will help you.

29:42.848 --> 29:43.881
I just want to see her.

29:43.883 --> 29:45.883
I totally get that.

29:45.885 --> 29:48.018
I mean, it's not like
I'm going to tell about Dad

29:48.020 --> 29:49.453
or tell her who
we are or anything

29:49.455 --> 29:51.522
if I think she's a dick.

29:51.524 --> 29:52.523
OK.

Well, let's talk
about it at home.

31:11.604 --> 31:14.905
No, you're not.

my life trying to figure out

grab my daughter.

Not grab her, but--

it's a lot weirder for

I don't care how many of you
have done extra work before.

33:33.946 --> 33:35.579
No eating from crafty.

33:35.581 --> 33:37.614
Who here knows what
I'm talking about?

33:37.616 --> 33:41.251
Do not, I repeat, do not
speak to the principals.

33:41.253 --> 33:42.853
You may think whatever
you have to say

33:42.855 --> 33:44.121
is interesting and funny.

33:44.123 --> 33:46.256
I promise you, it isn't.

33:46.258 --> 33:47.591
No looking at the camera.

33:47.593 --> 33:49.259
No getting involved
in the scene.

33:49.261 --> 33:51.762
It's called background
work for a reason.

33:51.764 --> 33:52.562
Let's go!

33:52.564 --> 33:53.363
Move!

33:53.365 --> 33:55.532
No.

33:55.534 --> 33:58.468
Rachel, I just want
to see her one time.

33:58.470 --> 33:59.469
Please?

33:59.471 --> 34:01.038
What is the hold up?

34:01.040 --> 34:02.939
I need this.

34:02.941 --> 34:05.275
I won't fuck it up.

34:05.277 --> 34:07.944
I'm begging you.

34:07.946 --> 34:08.879
Please?

34:08.880 --> 34:09.880
CASTING DIRECTOR: Come on.

34:12.418 --> 34:15.217
We're not talking to her.

34:15.219 --> 34:17.454
We're just going to look at her.

34:17.456 --> 34:18.822
OK.

34:18.824 --> 34:20.623
CASTING DIRECTOR: Don't
make me physically move you.

34:22.460 --> 34:23.293
Here we come.

34:23.295 --> 34:24.293
And we're coming.

34:24.295 --> 34:26.663
Let's go.

34:26.665 --> 34:27.464
Faster.

34:27.466 --> 34:28.231
Come on.

34:32.804 --> 34:34.271
She's [inaudible]

34:34.273 --> 34:35.438
MALE ACTOR: You got a knot.

34:35.440 --> 34:36.973
FEMALE ACTOR: You'd
better get it out.

34:36.975 --> 34:39.009
MALE ACTOR: You need some
deep tissue right here.

34:39.011 --> 34:39.810
[chatter]

34:39.812 --> 34:40.744
No.

34:40.746 --> 34:42.112
Excuse me?
Sorry.

34:42.114 --> 34:43.647
Hi.

34:43.649 --> 34:45.282
I just wanted to say, really
creative choices in the Roger

34:45.284 --> 34:46.483
funeral scene, the second one.

34:46.485 --> 34:47.818
Because I'm a
theater actor, so I

34:47.820 --> 34:49.619
can really tell when
somebody's drop dead.

34:49.621 --> 34:51.353
Honestly, it was like
watching Shakespeare.

34:51.356 --> 34:52.621
So good job.

34:52.623 --> 34:53.489
OK.
[bell ringing]

34:53.492 --> 34:54.291
DIRECTOR: Great.

34:54.293 --> 34:55.125
Here we go.

34:55.127 --> 34:56.159
Camera speed.

34:56.161 --> 34:57.461
Sound speed.

34:57.463 --> 34:58.728
And action.

35:04.203 --> 35:05.502
FEMALE ACTOR: Sorry I'm late.

35:05.504 --> 35:07.637
MALE ACTOR: Better
late than never.

35:07.639 --> 35:09.873
FEMALE ACTOR: Mom would kill
me if she knew I was here.

35:09.875 --> 35:11.675
MALE ACTOR: Not if
I kill her first.

35:11.677 --> 35:12.976
FEMALE ACTOR: Oh, you are bad.

35:12.978 --> 35:14.511
MALE ACTOR: Did you
bring the money?

35:14.513 --> 35:17.013
FEMALE ACTOR: They'd only let
me take out $10,000 in cash.

35:17.015 --> 35:19.015
MALE ACTOR: We need more.

35:19.017 --> 35:22.319
SHERRELL: What are
you doing here?

35:22.321 --> 35:23.353
FEMALE ACTOR: Mom?

35:23.355 --> 35:24.688
SHERRELL: You think
you could just

35:24.690 --> 35:28.725
show up like this out of
nowhere, with no warning?

35:31.630 --> 35:37.300
You took everything I had--

35:37.302 --> 35:41.238
my inheritance, my dignity.

35:41.240 --> 35:44.307
And now you want my daughter?

35:44.309 --> 35:45.142
DIRECTOR: Cut.

35:45.144 --> 35:45.909
Oh, I'm sorry.

35:45.911 --> 35:46.977
I'm sorry.

35:46.979 --> 35:48.044
I just-- I-- Ronnie,
I mean Rick--

35:48.046 --> 35:49.179
MALE ACTOR: Jesus
Christ, Sherrell.

35:49.181 --> 35:49.980
Sherell!
[chatter]

35:49.982 --> 35:51.047
Before you say anything--

35:51.049 --> 35:52.649
MALE ACTOR: Come on.

35:52.651 --> 35:54.317
SHERRELL: --I thought Miranda
is not going to be intimidated

35:54.319 --> 35:56.086
by this guy--
DIRECTOR: Right.

35:56.088 --> 35:57.587
SHERRELL: --or anybody.
DIRECTOR: Right.

35:57.589 --> 35:59.156
SHERRELL: So I just thought,
I really just think that--

35:59.158 --> 36:00.323
So this is the line I wrote.

36:00.325 --> 36:01.491
I know what you wrote.

36:01.493 --> 36:02.526
So just say that.

36:02.528 --> 36:03.493
I just--

36:03.495 --> 36:05.061
I don't want to say that.
- Just say that.

36:05.063 --> 36:06.062
I feel something diff--

36:06.064 --> 36:08.031
And don't hit him.

36:08.033 --> 36:08.999
Fuck.

36:09.001 --> 36:11.935
[chatter]

36:13.438 --> 36:14.938
SHERRELL: What do I know?

36:14.940 --> 36:18.508
I've just been living with
this woman for 30 years.

36:18.510 --> 36:19.509
Let's get out of here.

36:19.511 --> 36:20.277
No.

36:20.279 --> 36:22.879
We shouldn't be here.

36:22.881 --> 36:24.347
CASTING DIRECTOR: You, out.

36:24.349 --> 36:25.615
You looked right into camera.

36:25.617 --> 36:26.516
No, I didn't.

36:26.518 --> 36:27.751
She looked right into camera.

36:27.753 --> 36:28.752
The take's no good.

36:28.754 --> 36:29.586
It's OK, because
we're leaving.

36:29.588 --> 36:30.587
No, I'm staying.

36:30.589 --> 36:31.755
Jackie, they
asked us to leave.

36:31.757 --> 36:32.889
Let's go.
- I want to talk to [inaudible].

36:32.891 --> 36:33.723
SECURITY GUARD: Let's go.
JACKIE: No.

36:33.725 --> 36:34.791
That is really unnecessary.

36:34.793 --> 36:36.193
CASTING DIRECTOR:
What is going on?

36:36.195 --> 36:38.028
I'm Sharon Gurner's
daughter, and so is she.

36:41.934 --> 36:42.766
That's not my name.

36:53.212 --> 36:54.177
That's me.

37:00.118 --> 37:01.985
RACHEL: We didn't want
to bother you at work.

37:01.987 --> 37:03.220
We--
- Yeah.

37:03.222 --> 37:04.688
We just didn't know
where else to find you.

37:10.629 --> 37:12.128
[bell ringing]

37:12.130 --> 37:13.763
DIRECTOR: Well, we're not
going to get another shot in,

37:13.765 --> 37:15.265
so that's lunch.

37:15.267 --> 37:16.766
We're eating outside today.

37:16.768 --> 37:17.567
Happy anniversary.

37:17.569 --> 37:18.335
[chatter]

37:18.337 --> 37:19.903
Come on, guys.

37:19.905 --> 37:21.671
That's it for now.

37:21.673 --> 37:23.306
Time for lunch.

37:23.308 --> 37:26.176
[chatter]

37:31.149 --> 37:34.017
[music playing]

37:38.824 --> 37:42.926
Would you like to
join me for lunch?

37:45.797 --> 37:46.596
100%

37:46.598 --> 37:49.566
[music playing]

39:16.455 --> 39:18.588
SHERRELL: Let's take this
back to my dressing room.

39:18.590 --> 39:19.956
JACKIE: OK.

39:19.958 --> 39:21.424
RACHEL: OK.

39:21.426 --> 39:22.926
[speaking russian]

39:22.928 --> 39:24.561
SHERRELL: Oh, do you
do speak Russian?

39:24.563 --> 39:25.795
No.

39:25.797 --> 39:28.932
That's the only thing
in Russian that I know.

39:28.934 --> 39:30.033
Yup.

39:30.035 --> 39:31.568
Can I just say also
that I just love

39:31.570 --> 39:32.769
how you've decorated in here?

39:32.771 --> 39:33.803
Thank you.

39:33.805 --> 39:35.372
This stuff, the
pink, it's really--

39:35.374 --> 39:37.907
SHERRELL: Do you two do
a lot of background work?

39:37.909 --> 39:39.142
Oh, no.
No, no.

39:39.144 --> 39:41.378
I'm-- I'm an actress,
actress, mostly theater.

39:41.380 --> 39:43.279
And she is my producer.

39:43.281 --> 39:44.781
The stage manager.

39:44.783 --> 39:46.449
SHERRELL: Well, that's
where I started,

39:46.451 --> 39:51.454
which is why I have such a
low tolerance for bad writing.

39:51.456 --> 39:55.125
They bring in these young kids
who know nothing about drama.

39:55.127 --> 39:56.626
JACKIE: Probably
like that little guy

39:56.628 --> 39:58.461
that was trying to tell
you what to do, huh?

39:58.463 --> 39:59.896
SHERRELL: Yes.

39:59.898 --> 40:03.800
I also have a very low
tolerance for controlling men.

40:03.802 --> 40:07.971
[chuckles] I run screaming
in the other direction of I

40:07.973 --> 40:10.440
have a sense that someone
is trying to box me in.

40:10.442 --> 40:11.508
Excuse me.

40:11.510 --> 40:13.109
Ain't that just the way?

40:13.111 --> 40:16.446
Because honestly, I'm the exact
same way with controlling men.

40:16.448 --> 40:19.315
[music playing]

40:28.326 --> 40:30.360
JACKIE: Dad, sit up!
Help me get his head, Rachel.

40:30.362 --> 40:31.828
He can't breathe.
Dodge, call 911.

40:31.830 --> 40:32.996
DODGE: OK.
JACKIE: Call 911.

40:32.998 --> 40:34.497
Tell them the address.
Hold his head.

40:34.499 --> 40:35.832
Hold his head.
He can't get air.

40:35.834 --> 40:36.933
Dad?

40:36.935 --> 40:38.501
He wasn't like, a
bad guy, bad guy--

40:38.503 --> 40:40.036
SHERRELL: Uh-huh.

40:40.038 --> 40:41.204
Like, the kind of guy that
you, like, head for the hills

40:41.206 --> 40:42.472
because of.
SHERRELL: Oh.

40:42.474 --> 40:43.706
He was just the kind
of guy that could only

40:43.708 --> 40:45.442
really hold a conversation
for 30 seconds

40:45.444 --> 40:46.309
before he wanted to--

40:46.311 --> 40:47.977
Jackie, let's go.

40:47.979 --> 40:50.180
I'm not leaving.

40:50.182 --> 40:52.215
RACHEL: We have that
thing we have to do.

40:52.217 --> 40:53.016
JACKIE: Malarkey.

40:53.018 --> 40:53.783
What thing?

40:56.354 --> 40:58.021
You know what I was
going to say before

40:58.023 --> 41:00.323
and it totally
skipped my mind is

41:00.325 --> 41:01.858
that I can run lines with you.

41:01.860 --> 41:03.326
Really?
JACKIE: Yeah.

41:03.328 --> 41:05.028
I'm actually one of those
actors that likes doing it.

41:05.030 --> 41:07.197
And we have a space we can
use because our dad used

41:07.199 --> 41:08.298
to run a theater company.

41:08.300 --> 41:09.666
So we-- and--

41:09.668 --> 41:13.536
well, he did-- it doesn't--

41:13.538 --> 41:14.537
sorry.

41:14.539 --> 41:15.538
I forgot I was--

41:15.540 --> 41:17.140
what was I saying?

41:17.142 --> 41:20.677
(SINGING) Sometimes the words
come out of my mouth and I'm--

41:20.679 --> 41:22.712
what were you saying before,
though, right before?

41:22.714 --> 41:26.216
It's nice to meet you.

41:26.218 --> 41:27.817
It was nice to meet you, too.

41:27.819 --> 41:30.153
JACKIE: Actually, can I-- um,
I'm going to give you my cell

41:30.155 --> 41:31.921
just because I think--
SHERRELL: Wonderful.

41:31.923 --> 41:33.890
In case you want
to get a hold of us.

41:33.892 --> 41:36.993
I tend to be the one doing
the secretarial duties.

41:36.995 --> 41:41.564
[chuckle] OK.

41:41.566 --> 41:44.234
My sevens look like nines,
so just be cognizant of that.

41:44.236 --> 41:46.269
Um-- it's--

41:46.271 --> 41:50.440
it's great, um, thank--

41:50.442 --> 41:52.008
thank you.

41:52.010 --> 41:53.676
Thank you.

41:53.678 --> 41:56.112
JACKIE: I'm pretty free.

41:56.114 --> 41:57.113
Good-- good to know.

41:57.115 --> 41:58.014
Jackie.

41:58.016 --> 41:59.115
JACKIE: You're a good hugger.

41:59.117 --> 42:00.450
OK.

42:00.452 --> 42:01.251
Bye.

42:01.253 --> 42:02.018
Bye.

42:07.425 --> 42:08.691
Yeah.

42:08.693 --> 42:10.260
She was going to find
out eventually anyway.

42:10.262 --> 42:11.528
Yeah.
No shit.

42:11.530 --> 42:13.530
But I'd like to at least get
through the play, our father's

42:13.532 --> 42:16.933
literally dying wish, before
we get kicked to the curb.

42:16.935 --> 42:18.568
Oh, that's what
you think this is?

42:18.570 --> 42:20.270
That woman's not going
to screw us over.

42:20.272 --> 42:21.204
She was so sweet.

42:21.206 --> 42:22.071
Oh, my god.

42:22.073 --> 42:23.206
She wanted to love us.

42:23.208 --> 42:24.974
Jackie, we don't know her.

42:24.976 --> 42:26.476
Well, I want to
get to know her.

42:26.478 --> 42:27.544
Yeah.

42:27.546 --> 42:29.445
I think I have a pretty
good idea of who she is.

42:29.447 --> 42:30.246
Oh, my god.

42:30.248 --> 42:31.447
What?
What?

42:31.449 --> 42:32.582
Who is that?
- Nobody.

42:32.584 --> 42:33.449
What are you doing?

42:33.451 --> 42:34.250
Nobody.

42:34.252 --> 42:35.585
Stop it.

42:35.587 --> 42:37.387
I'm going to go over and
I'm running lines with her

42:37.389 --> 42:38.187
at her house tonight.

42:40.792 --> 42:41.624
What?

42:41.626 --> 42:44.327
[music playing]

42:47.732 --> 42:48.798
CHARLES: I'm not an idiot.

42:48.800 --> 42:49.966
I know what pot smells like.

42:49.968 --> 42:51.568
All right?
- It's not even that bad.

42:51.570 --> 42:52.635
OK?
- Take your shoes off.

42:52.637 --> 42:54.170
Kendra does it
with her family.

42:54.172 --> 42:55.572
Kendra?
What kind of shit?

42:55.574 --> 42:57.774
I don't give a shit what
Kendra does with her family.

42:57.776 --> 42:58.608
All right?

42:58.610 --> 43:00.109
She's 16, and you're my kid.

43:00.111 --> 43:01.978
I don't have to listen to what
Kendra does with her family.

43:01.980 --> 43:03.196
Nonsense.

43:03.197 --> 43:04.413
OLIVIA: It's not like I'm
becoming a hooker or anything.

43:04.416 --> 43:05.582
Hooker?
Who says hooker anymore?

43:05.584 --> 43:07.116
It's sex worker.

43:07.118 --> 43:09.652
I've worked so hard to make
sure that you can just be a kid.

43:09.654 --> 43:10.920
Just enjoy it.

43:10.922 --> 43:12.488
I don't want to be a kid.

43:12.490 --> 43:13.356
Well, I'm sorry.

43:13.358 --> 43:14.190
You are a kid.

43:14.192 --> 43:16.326
Um, where's your bathroom?

43:16.328 --> 43:18.328
Upstairs.

43:18.330 --> 43:20.797
CHARLES: You got it from
that kid your age [inaudible]

43:20.799 --> 43:21.798
OLIVIA: Oh, my god.

43:21.800 --> 43:22.599
Relax.

43:22.601 --> 43:25.234
[muffled arguing]

43:31.676 --> 43:34.577
[music playing]

43:54.566 --> 43:55.365
Hi!

43:55.367 --> 43:57.367
Come on.

43:57.369 --> 43:59.502
Oh, you're here, too.

43:59.504 --> 44:01.170
Yes.

44:01.172 --> 44:03.840
A decorator helped
me with most of it.

44:03.842 --> 44:04.841
- Wow.
- Yeah, I know.

44:04.843 --> 44:06.075
It's beautiful.

44:06.077 --> 44:07.677
It's sort of a little
bit of the Hall of Fame.

44:07.679 --> 44:08.878
And I--
- Oh, it's you.

44:08.880 --> 44:09.679
Yes.

44:09.681 --> 44:11.681
And I-- I love pink roses.

44:11.683 --> 44:14.017
I don't know if either
of you gals like--

44:14.019 --> 44:14.817
oh.

44:14.819 --> 44:17.253
[laughs] This is for you.

44:17.255 --> 44:18.054
This is for me?

44:18.056 --> 44:18.888
Yes.

44:18.890 --> 44:19.822
I know it's silly.

44:19.824 --> 44:22.225
But I realized that I had them.

44:22.227 --> 44:24.894
I hung onto them.

44:24.896 --> 44:26.596
For 28 years?

44:26.598 --> 44:28.031
JACKIE: I love presents!

44:28.033 --> 44:29.165
You can ask Rachel.

44:29.167 --> 44:30.266
I flip out.

44:30.268 --> 44:32.101
Oh, my g-- oh, my
god, every birthday.

44:36.908 --> 44:40.543
[gasp] Oh, my god.

44:40.545 --> 44:41.544
So sweet, right?

44:41.546 --> 44:42.879
You can feed them.
JACKIE: I know.

44:42.881 --> 44:43.913
And they poop.

44:43.915 --> 44:45.415
That's amazing.
Rachel, open yours.

44:45.417 --> 44:46.282
Here's a script.

44:46.284 --> 44:49.218
Didn't you want to run lines?

44:49.220 --> 44:52.255
If you don't turn off
the path of destruction

44:52.257 --> 44:54.590
you're headed down,
I'm going to have

44:54.592 --> 44:56.426
to cut you off at the pass.

44:56.428 --> 45:00.196
And there's bound
to be a collision.

45:00.198 --> 45:04.100
I don't want us to both go
down in flames for this, Carl.

45:04.102 --> 45:05.435
Isn't that awful?

45:05.437 --> 45:06.302
JACKIE: Yeah.

45:06.304 --> 45:09.072
Because it said down in flames.

45:09.074 --> 45:09.939
It's barely English.

45:09.941 --> 45:11.974
It's up in flames.

45:11.976 --> 45:13.643
You can't go down in flames.

45:13.645 --> 45:15.244
RACHEL: No.

45:15.246 --> 45:18.147
It's a really convoluted way of
saying if you keep doing this,

45:18.149 --> 45:21.217
there will be consequences
for both of us.

45:21.219 --> 45:22.285
SHERRELL: Exactly.

45:22.287 --> 45:23.453
That-- that's right.

45:23.455 --> 45:25.788
That's-- that's perfect,
and this is awful.

45:25.790 --> 45:27.790
I actually don't
think it's that awful.

45:27.792 --> 45:33.329
Um, if you tried, like,
if you don't turn off

45:33.331 --> 45:36.799
the path of destruction
you're headed down,

45:36.801 --> 45:40.002
I'm going to have to
cut you off at the pass.

45:40.004 --> 45:43.573
And there's bound
to be a collision.

45:43.575 --> 45:46.075
I don't want us to both go
down in flames for this, Carl.

45:54.686 --> 45:57.153
What did you just say before?

45:57.155 --> 45:58.521
Um--

45:58.523 --> 46:04.293
If you can do that for
all these garbage lines,

46:04.295 --> 46:06.596
I would give you my first born.

46:09.167 --> 46:09.999
Oh, that's you.

46:10.001 --> 46:10.833
JACKIE: Yeah.

46:10.835 --> 46:12.168
[laughs] Whoops.

46:12.170 --> 46:13.002
Don't give me away.

46:13.004 --> 46:14.670
[laughs]

46:14.672 --> 46:15.571
Do you have a pen?

46:19.010 --> 46:20.510
JACKIE: Great.

46:20.512 --> 46:22.512
Then you can do that, and
then I can run lines with you.

46:22.514 --> 46:25.181
So you've got-- it's
a two member team.

46:25.183 --> 46:28.117
[music playing]

46:33.158 --> 46:37.293
SHERRELL: Oh, you're just
making Miranda human again.

46:37.295 --> 46:39.862
You really tapped into the fact
that she's a wounded woman.

46:39.864 --> 46:43.499
And-- and-- and I-- and I think
the jealousy with Chloe comes

46:43.501 --> 46:44.667
from the fact that--

46:44.669 --> 46:46.135
that Miranda never
really wanted children.

46:52.710 --> 46:58.848
She was running away from
abusive parents and, um,

46:58.850 --> 47:01.484
a series of abusive boyfriends.

47:01.486 --> 47:07.824
And, uh, when she
met Chloe's father,

47:07.826 --> 47:10.927
thought that because
somebody loved her and wasn't

47:10.929 --> 47:14.063
beating her up that she
owed them something.

47:14.065 --> 47:19.936
And he wanted a family,
but she never wanted one.

47:29.914 --> 47:31.314
Oh, open your present.

47:50.935 --> 47:54.570
You-- you used to squat like
that when you were a baby.

47:54.572 --> 48:01.177
It was so-- [laughs] It was
so funny and so strange.

48:04.883 --> 48:07.717
Jackie, get up.

48:07.719 --> 48:08.484
Get up.

48:08.486 --> 48:09.285
We're going.

48:11.789 --> 48:13.623
JACKIE: What?

48:13.625 --> 48:14.457
RACHEL: Come on.

48:14.459 --> 48:15.591
It's time to go.

48:15.593 --> 48:16.959
JACKIE: Thank you.
- Sure.

48:16.961 --> 48:17.693
JACKIE: Bye.

48:20.798 --> 48:23.466
RACHEL: We have
squatter's rights.

48:23.468 --> 48:26.802
She can't do shit
for like, six months.

48:26.804 --> 48:31.841
If we start casting now, that's
two weeks, a month to rehearse.

48:31.843 --> 48:35.278
We want at least
a two month run.

48:35.280 --> 48:37.980
That's fine.

48:37.982 --> 48:40.016
She was so sweet, though.

48:40.018 --> 48:42.418
No.

48:42.420 --> 48:43.286
No, Jackie.

48:43.288 --> 48:44.654
She abandoned her children.

48:44.656 --> 48:46.355
She's not s--

48:46.357 --> 48:47.156
Dodge.

48:47.158 --> 48:47.924
Dodge.

49:32.303 --> 49:35.237
[footsteps]

49:39.210 --> 49:41.544
OLIVIA: I made you
a vision board.

49:41.546 --> 49:43.879
It's my vision for you look
because if you could actually

49:43.881 --> 49:44.647
be very pretty.

49:48.820 --> 49:50.353
It's my girl, Queen of Hearts.

49:50.355 --> 49:52.655
Don't touch that.

49:52.657 --> 49:54.223
Those were my grandfather's.

49:57.996 --> 49:59.095
Where are you from?

49:59.097 --> 50:01.063
The Village.

50:01.065 --> 50:02.064
No.

50:02.066 --> 50:04.834
My ancestors are French-Hatian.

50:04.836 --> 50:05.601
Your dad's Asian.

50:05.603 --> 50:06.602
Right?

50:06.604 --> 50:08.537
Yeah.

50:08.539 --> 50:10.206
Why don't you know your roots?

50:10.208 --> 50:11.907
Because I don't know my dad.

50:11.909 --> 50:14.243
That's why you're acting
all intense about your grandpa

50:14.245 --> 50:15.845
being dead.

50:15.847 --> 50:17.913
And you miss your mom, which
is why you hang out with girls

50:17.915 --> 50:21.083
were lame enough to
get a 12-year-old high.

50:21.085 --> 50:22.918
I'm 13.

50:22.920 --> 50:23.686
Cool.

50:32.063 --> 50:33.362
OLIVIA: What are
you looking for?

50:41.606 --> 50:44.140
Here.

50:44.142 --> 50:46.308
These ones are a
little harder to use,

50:46.310 --> 50:49.145
but they're better
for the environment.

50:52.283 --> 50:55.451
Do you have a pad?

50:55.453 --> 50:56.652
Ew, no.

50:56.654 --> 50:59.121
Those things are like diapers.

50:59.123 --> 51:02.124
You've never used a
tampon before, have you?

51:02.126 --> 51:04.560
Um--

51:04.562 --> 51:06.028
It will change your life.

51:11.002 --> 51:11.333
Here.

51:14.806 --> 51:15.738
Take off the plastic.

51:15.740 --> 51:16.639
Come on, do it.

51:19.777 --> 51:22.812
Here, on three.

51:22.814 --> 51:23.913
Uh, I've got it.

51:23.915 --> 51:25.648
Thanks.

51:25.650 --> 51:26.715
OK, Miss Modesty.

51:29.687 --> 51:30.486
Good luck.

51:46.504 --> 51:49.004
On three.

51:49.006 --> 51:54.076
One, two, shoot it up there.

52:00.184 --> 52:01.083
Did you get it?

52:10.294 --> 52:12.161
Yeah.

52:12.163 --> 52:13.129
Great.

52:13.131 --> 52:14.797
Now wash your hands.

52:14.799 --> 52:17.733
[music playing]

52:23.674 --> 52:25.574
CHARLES: Hey Dodge,
your mom's on her way!

52:25.576 --> 52:28.544
[music playing]

52:45.997 --> 52:50.933
The wiser I become,
the more debased.

52:50.935 --> 52:53.402
"De-based", debased?

52:53.404 --> 52:56.338
[crying]

52:59.911 --> 53:01.377
OK.

53:01.379 --> 53:02.178
That was great.

53:02.180 --> 53:03.112
Thanks, Rodney.

53:03.114 --> 53:03.913
Good job.

53:07.552 --> 53:08.884
Yes.

53:08.886 --> 53:11.887
We'll be in touch.

53:11.889 --> 53:13.055
Does the scene feel weird?

53:13.057 --> 53:14.089
No.

53:14.091 --> 53:15.357
It's not the scene,
it's the actors.

53:15.359 --> 53:16.926
Dad could pull it off.

53:16.928 --> 53:19.428
But it's just a little intense
to do it over and over again.

53:19.430 --> 53:20.262
Woo!

53:20.264 --> 53:21.363
So hot.

53:21.365 --> 53:24.099
Hey, you got a sec?

53:24.101 --> 53:25.034
Yes, hi.

53:25.036 --> 53:26.235
I'm so sorry.

53:26.237 --> 53:27.736
I wanted to apologize
for the other night.

53:27.738 --> 53:31.207
Jackie gave me a Starbucks
gift card to apologize,

53:31.209 --> 53:33.209
and explained to
me about your dad.

53:33.211 --> 53:33.976
I get it.

53:33.978 --> 53:34.877
Thanks.

53:34.879 --> 53:36.445
Were normally very on top of it.

53:36.447 --> 53:37.947
Totally.

53:37.949 --> 53:39.715
Listen, can I talk to you
about this credit card stuff?

53:39.717 --> 53:40.549
[phone ringing]

53:40.551 --> 53:42.218
I'm actually the executor.

53:42.220 --> 53:43.152
Oh, shit.

53:43.154 --> 53:43.953
It's the morgue.

53:43.955 --> 53:44.787
Sorry.

53:44.789 --> 53:45.588
I'll take it.

53:45.590 --> 53:47.957
I got it.

53:47.959 --> 53:49.792
This is Jacqueline Gurner.

53:49.794 --> 53:50.960
Go ahead.

53:50.962 --> 53:53.329
So you-- you know
about this debt, yeah?

53:53.331 --> 53:56.131
Because you and your sister's
names are also on the account.

53:56.133 --> 53:56.966
Yeah.

53:56.968 --> 53:57.967
That's the company card.

53:57.969 --> 53:59.401
It's not that much, right?

53:59.403 --> 54:02.638
Um, maybe we're talking
about a different company card.

54:02.640 --> 54:04.473
I don't think your
support group rentals are

54:04.475 --> 54:06.275
paying all the bills.

54:06.277 --> 54:09.278
Listen, this-- this can
be put on a payment plan.

54:09.280 --> 54:11.480
So just take a deep breath, OK?

54:11.482 --> 54:13.315
But there is one other thing.

54:13.317 --> 54:15.184
Um, it's not a big deal.

54:15.186 --> 54:18.988
But the theater's license
has expired by two years.

54:18.990 --> 54:20.856
Look, look, it's an
easy thing to fix.

54:20.858 --> 54:22.424
OK?

54:22.426 --> 54:24.159
So I already printed out the
forms for you and your sister.

54:24.161 --> 54:27.162
I just need your
signatures right there.

54:27.164 --> 54:29.965
You need the owner of
the building's signature.

54:29.967 --> 54:31.934
Only if you want
an audience in here.

54:31.936 --> 54:32.701
OK.

54:32.703 --> 54:34.203
Cremation's scheduled.

54:34.205 --> 54:37.473
Jackie, I need you to
text Sherrell and tell her

54:37.475 --> 54:38.807
that we want to hang out.

54:38.809 --> 54:39.608
OK.

54:39.610 --> 54:40.509
Thank you.

54:40.511 --> 54:41.343
Finally.

54:41.345 --> 54:43.112
Grab that folder.

54:43.114 --> 54:45.314
Oh, by the way, I'm
doing taco night tonight.

54:45.316 --> 54:46.682
And Olivia wanted to--
- Amazing.

54:46.684 --> 54:48.117
--invite Dodge.

54:48.119 --> 54:48.884
Oh, great.

54:48.886 --> 54:50.119
That works out perfectly.

54:50.121 --> 54:51.487
I have plans.

54:51.489 --> 54:53.022
And yeah, that-- I think
she would really like that.

54:53.024 --> 54:54.690
She's allergic to
dairy, and she doesn't

54:54.692 --> 54:56.058
like things that are green.
But--

54:56.060 --> 54:57.192
RACHEL: Jackie!
- Got it.

54:57.194 --> 54:58.794
Cool.

54:58.796 --> 55:01.330
Coming!

55:01.332 --> 55:02.131
Bye.

55:02.133 --> 55:02.898
All right.

55:05.303 --> 55:07.469
If there's any way you
guys can come back tomorrow

55:07.471 --> 55:08.837
same time, that
would be amazing.

55:08.839 --> 55:10.072
Thank you so much.
- Oh, sure.

55:10.074 --> 55:11.307
Ooh.

55:11.309 --> 55:13.208
I hope you guys can do something
nice for yourselves today.

55:13.210 --> 55:14.009
Thanks.

55:14.011 --> 55:16.612
[music playing]

55:24.422 --> 55:30.426
Well-- um, welcome.

55:30.428 --> 55:31.760
Is everything all right?
- Yeah.

55:31.762 --> 55:33.028
Yeah.

55:33.030 --> 55:34.530
Just wanted to see how
those scenes were going.

55:34.532 --> 55:36.365
Good, thank you.

55:36.367 --> 55:37.900
This is so fun.

55:37.902 --> 55:40.235
It's so fun, all of us
together just hanging out,

55:40.237 --> 55:41.570
Three Musketeers.

55:41.572 --> 55:43.739
Oh, I already got you, so
I might as well get you.

55:43.741 --> 55:45.174
Woo!

55:45.176 --> 55:47.076
MAN: Sherrell, could
I invite you to set?

55:47.078 --> 55:48.410
SHERRELL: Oh.
- Is that you?

55:48.412 --> 55:49.178
Let's go.

55:51.749 --> 55:54.283
JACKIE: Um, will I
miss anything if I pee?

55:54.285 --> 55:56.685
[scream] No!

55:56.687 --> 55:57.619
No!

55:57.621 --> 55:58.420
No!

55:58.422 --> 56:00.289
My baby!

56:00.291 --> 56:01.190
Mom!

56:01.192 --> 56:01.957
Mom!

56:06.731 --> 56:10.199
Who would do this?

56:10.201 --> 56:12.134
Everything's OK, baby.

56:12.136 --> 56:13.902
Everything's fine.

56:13.904 --> 56:19.608
I'm sure-- I'm sure she
just got hit by a car

56:19.610 --> 56:22.878
and crawled into
the garden to die.

56:25.449 --> 56:26.782
DIRECTOR: Cut!
[bell ringing]

56:26.784 --> 56:28.050
OK.

56:28.052 --> 56:30.052
So that's not what we
talked about, but fine.

56:30.054 --> 56:30.986
WRITER: No, no, no, no.

56:30.988 --> 56:32.054
It's not fine.

56:32.056 --> 56:33.622
She completely
rewrote that scene.

56:33.624 --> 56:36.291
SHERRELL: It didn't mess
up any of the plot points.

56:36.293 --> 56:37.493
And we felt that Miranda--

56:37.495 --> 56:38.761
DIRECTOR: We?

56:38.763 --> 56:40.062
SHERRELL: --would want
to protect her daughter.

56:40.064 --> 56:41.063
DIRECTOR: Who's we?
- Wait.

56:41.065 --> 56:42.264
I'm sorry.

56:42.266 --> 56:43.399
Who are you?
MALE ACTOR: Morning, everyone.

56:43.401 --> 56:44.600
Whoa.
No, no, no, no, no.

56:44.602 --> 56:46.101
This-- this woman is
actually a safety issue.

56:46.103 --> 56:48.103
- Oh, I'm a safety issue?
- You darling, are a psychopath.

56:48.105 --> 56:50.239
I don't know if you
remember what happened, but--

56:50.241 --> 56:52.508
OK, listen, haircut.
You do not talk to her that way.

56:52.510 --> 56:53.809
SHERRELL: Yeah.
- How dare you?

56:53.811 --> 56:54.810
This is a woman.
- OK.

56:54.812 --> 56:56.812
How dare you talk
to her that way?

56:56.814 --> 56:59.348
She is the smartest
person I know.

56:59.350 --> 57:02.951
She has more talent
in her little finger

57:02.953 --> 57:06.422
than you have in
your entire body.

57:06.424 --> 57:08.824
I am so appalled with
the way they treated you

57:08.826 --> 57:11.326
after you saved that scene.

57:11.328 --> 57:13.162
Little window into my life.

57:13.164 --> 57:13.962
Yeah.

57:13.964 --> 57:16.765
[knock on door]

57:17.835 --> 57:19.835
I'm so sorry to bother you.

57:19.837 --> 57:23.839
But I have Michael here for you.

57:23.841 --> 57:24.706
Hi.

57:24.708 --> 57:27.476
Can we talk out in the hallway?

57:27.478 --> 57:28.811
I am not reshooting this.

57:28.813 --> 57:31.713
Rachel, I really feel
like we should be focused

57:31.715 --> 57:33.282
on Dad's cremation right now.

57:33.284 --> 57:35.717
I can't leave.

57:35.719 --> 57:37.286
[sigh] What are
we even doing here?

57:37.288 --> 57:38.353
You don't even like her.

57:38.355 --> 57:39.521
You think she's a B-I-T-C-H.

57:39.523 --> 57:41.023
Who said that?

57:59.009 --> 57:59.775
Hm.

58:03.747 --> 58:05.781
They're putting me in a coma.

58:08.419 --> 58:09.551
What does that mean?

58:09.553 --> 58:11.353
SHERRELL: They say
it's only temporary,

58:11.355 --> 58:16.291
but that's the way
they kill people off.

58:20.397 --> 58:23.165
I don't want you to think
that this is your fault.

58:23.167 --> 58:25.667
It's not your fault.
They're trying

58:25.669 --> 58:27.736
to appeal to a younger audience.

58:27.738 --> 58:31.073
But that's bullshit.

58:31.075 --> 58:33.275
It's that little shit, Damien.

58:33.277 --> 58:35.377
I mean, you
rewrote that scene.

58:35.379 --> 58:37.746
He would rather kill
Miranda off then come up

58:37.748 --> 58:41.250
with a good storyline
for her because he can.

58:41.252 --> 58:42.851
I can come up with
a good storyline.

58:42.853 --> 58:44.219
I-- I can do that.

58:44.221 --> 58:46.121
We can come up with something
that's very current.

58:46.123 --> 58:48.557
And then if they say no to
it, you just call them out

58:48.559 --> 58:49.892
for age discrimination.

58:49.894 --> 58:51.059
They can't fire you.

58:51.061 --> 58:52.594
Oh, that's perfect!

58:52.596 --> 58:54.930
And we can pitch it at the
anniversary party tonight.

58:54.932 --> 58:55.797
Perfect.

58:55.799 --> 58:57.199
Well, we have plans tonight.

58:57.201 --> 58:59.968
So--

58:59.970 --> 59:02.571
Oh.

59:02.573 --> 59:03.438
Oh, my god.

59:03.440 --> 59:05.107
You saved my life.

59:05.109 --> 59:07.743
You are the best.

59:07.745 --> 59:11.246
Oh, and if your plans change,
you could join us later,

59:11.248 --> 59:12.781
sweetheart.

59:12.783 --> 59:13.582
All right.

59:13.584 --> 59:14.449
So let's think.

59:14.451 --> 59:16.051
Let's put on our thinking caps.

59:16.053 --> 59:18.287
Oh, what-- what if we do
a denying the gay character

59:18.289 --> 59:20.122
a wedding cake storyline?
- I'm going to go.

59:20.124 --> 59:22.624
RACHEL: Miranda we're out of
her coma and suddenly she's--

59:22.626 --> 59:24.927
she's a conservative baker.

59:24.929 --> 59:28.297
And she is not going to
give that guy his cake.

59:28.299 --> 59:30.766
And he's played by a younger
character, than that involves

59:30.768 --> 59:32.134
the younger characters and it--

59:32.136 --> 59:33.669
it's very current-ish.

59:33.671 --> 59:35.804
Oh, oh, oh, that's--

59:35.806 --> 59:37.472
that's interesting.

59:37.474 --> 59:41.476
But a baker-- they just wouldn't
want me to be unattractive.

59:44.949 --> 59:46.481
OK.

59:46.483 --> 59:47.916
Just keep thinking.

59:47.918 --> 59:49.318
Keep thinking.

59:49.320 --> 59:50.519
We're on to something.

59:50.521 --> 59:51.353
Yes.

59:51.355 --> 59:52.154
OK.

59:53.824 --> 59:56.024
SHERRELL: And I'll get rid
of the rest of this blood.

59:56.026 --> 59:58.927
[music playing]

01:00:10.274 --> 01:00:11.707
Where have you been?

01:00:15.646 --> 01:00:18.113
You look really good.

01:00:18.115 --> 01:00:19.047
You look good.

01:00:19.049 --> 01:00:20.048
And.

01:00:20.050 --> 01:00:23.352
Here you go It's a Pino.

01:00:23.354 --> 01:00:24.720
I'm sorry, it's
just all we have.

01:00:24.722 --> 01:00:25.520
I love Pinos.

01:00:25.522 --> 01:00:26.955
Oh, good.

01:00:26.957 --> 01:00:30.292
So what did you want
to, uh, talk to me about?

01:00:30.294 --> 01:00:32.027
Her daughter, Dodge,
is a patient of mine.

01:00:32.029 --> 01:00:33.228
- Oh, of course.
- Yes.

01:00:33.230 --> 01:00:34.630
She's really been missing you.

01:00:34.632 --> 01:00:38.634
It's been a very hard
week for her, very hard.

01:00:38.636 --> 01:00:40.869
But we are seeing each
other on Thursday, aren't we?

01:00:40.871 --> 01:00:42.070
Mm-hmm.

01:00:42.072 --> 01:00:44.339
She respects that you
have other clients,

01:00:44.341 --> 01:00:46.208
but she's just still
needs to feel like she's

01:00:46.210 --> 01:00:48.810
a priority in your life.

01:00:48.812 --> 01:00:49.678
Miss Gaynor--

01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:50.912
Gurner.

01:00:50.914 --> 01:00:53.315
Uh, I'm not at liberty
to discuss my patients

01:00:53.317 --> 01:00:56.351
in front of my wife.

01:00:56.353 --> 01:00:58.220
We can go in another room.

01:00:58.222 --> 01:01:02.691
[laughs] How old
is your daughter?

01:01:02.693 --> 01:01:03.859
She's 12.

01:01:03.861 --> 01:01:05.360
Oh, what a tough age.
Huh?

01:01:05.362 --> 01:01:06.495
Mm-hmm.

01:01:06.497 --> 01:01:07.729
We don't have kids
of our own, but we

01:01:07.731 --> 01:01:09.731
do have two nephews
who live in Tucson

01:01:09.733 --> 01:01:11.333
that we don't see
near enough of.

01:01:11.335 --> 01:01:12.868
I keep telling him.

01:01:12.870 --> 01:01:15.671
And just every time that my
sister posts a picture of them,

01:01:15.673 --> 01:01:17.606
I literally melt. Get this.

01:01:17.608 --> 01:01:20.842
OK, so they love Batman
more than anything else

01:01:20.844 --> 01:01:22.044
in the world.

01:01:22.046 --> 01:01:23.412
But they're not old
enough to pronounce it.

01:01:23.414 --> 01:01:25.614
And so they say Bahma.

01:01:25.616 --> 01:01:27.382
[laughs]

01:01:27.384 --> 01:01:28.150
That's funny.

01:01:31.689 --> 01:01:33.755
Uh, it's not
uncommon for children

01:01:33.757 --> 01:01:36.091
to develop an attachment
to their therapist.

01:01:36.093 --> 01:01:38.593
And I take responsibility for
thinking that you could handle

01:01:38.595 --> 01:01:39.928
a more casual rapport with me.

01:01:39.930 --> 01:01:42.364
But I do think it's in
her interest at this point

01:01:42.366 --> 01:01:43.899
to find another therapist.

01:01:43.901 --> 01:01:46.101
I'm really glad that you were
picking up on those signals.

01:01:46.103 --> 01:01:48.270
Because that's actually
why I came over here,

01:01:48.272 --> 01:01:50.906
was just to tell you that
you are unfortunately fired.

01:01:50.908 --> 01:01:52.974
So we won't be needing
your services anymore.

01:01:52.976 --> 01:01:55.811
And, um, thank you for that.

01:01:55.813 --> 01:01:56.812
Thank you for your time.

01:01:56.814 --> 01:01:58.880
And you are very pretty.

01:01:58.882 --> 01:01:59.981
You're pretty.

01:01:59.983 --> 01:02:00.782
Thank you.

01:02:05.255 --> 01:02:09.891
What did I tell you about
fucking your clients' parents?

01:02:09.893 --> 01:02:10.759
It's pedestrian.

01:02:10.761 --> 01:02:11.560
Right.

01:02:11.562 --> 01:02:14.196

01:02:26.143 --> 01:02:29.578
[cell phone buzzing]

01:02:34.118 --> 01:02:35.584
Hey, Jackie.
What's up?

01:02:35.586 --> 01:02:36.818
JACKIE (ON PHONE): Hey, Chuck.

01:02:36.820 --> 01:02:38.487
Does anyone call you chuck?

01:02:38.489 --> 01:02:39.488
No.

01:02:39.490 --> 01:02:40.455
Well, they should.

01:02:40.457 --> 01:02:41.590
What's-- how's my kiddo?

01:02:41.592 --> 01:02:42.991
CHARLES (ON PHONE):
She's doing great.

01:02:42.993 --> 01:02:46.595
She's out there kicking
Olivia's butt at, uh, cards.

01:02:46.597 --> 01:02:48.330
You want me to have
her call you later?

01:02:48.332 --> 01:02:50.532
Well, I was actually
wondering what you were doing.

01:02:50.534 --> 01:02:52.434
And I was wondering
if you wanted to get

01:02:52.436 --> 01:02:53.935
a glass of wine or something.

01:02:57.841 --> 01:02:59.274
CHARLES (ON PHONE):
Listen, uh, I'm

01:02:59.276 --> 01:03:03.712
just going to hang
here with the girls.

01:03:03.714 --> 01:03:05.514
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:03:05.516 --> 01:03:06.982
No, actually-- you know what?

01:03:06.984 --> 01:03:09.184
When I think of it, today is
actually not great for me,

01:03:09.186 --> 01:03:10.185
either.

01:03:10.187 --> 01:03:11.686
Because I've got
to get a massage.

01:03:11.688 --> 01:03:12.721
So I--

01:03:12.723 --> 01:03:13.355
CHARLES (ON PHONE):
Check in later.

01:03:13.357 --> 01:03:14.189
Yeah.

01:03:14.191 --> 01:03:15.357
Why don't I check in later?

01:03:15.359 --> 01:03:16.458
And you guys have fun.

01:03:16.460 --> 01:03:18.026
CHARLES (ON PHONE): Um--
- Yeah.

01:03:18.028 --> 01:03:20.195
CHARLES (ON PHONE): Maybe all
four of us could do something.

01:03:20.197 --> 01:03:21.963
Awesome.
CHARLES (ON PHONE): Sounds good.

01:03:21.965 --> 01:03:22.964
OK.
Thanks, Chuck.

01:03:22.966 --> 01:03:24.199
CHARLES (ON PHONE): Yeah.
- Sorry.

01:03:24.201 --> 01:03:25.367
Thanks, Charles.
CHARLES (ON PHONE): For sure.

01:03:25.369 --> 01:03:26.368
Sure.
- OK.

01:03:26.370 --> 01:03:27.536
CHARLES (ON PHONE): OK.
- Bye-bye.

01:03:27.538 --> 01:03:28.537

Miranda's family history?

01:03:38.215 --> 01:03:41.416
Just that she was left on
the doorstep of a nunnery.

01:03:43.220 --> 01:03:44.686
Where's the network now?

01:03:44.688 --> 01:03:46.354
I have young fans.

grandmother, Ruth.

01:04:04.908 --> 01:04:06.174
Right?

01:04:06.176 --> 01:04:08.043
Miranda can die or stay
in a coma or whatever.

01:04:08.045 --> 01:04:10.712
But you come back as her
super with-it evil twin.

01:04:10.714 --> 01:04:12.080
Who orchestrated
the whole thing.

01:04:12.082 --> 01:04:13.582
You were the reason
she's in the coma

01:04:13.584 --> 01:04:15.517
because you were always
jealous of your sister.

01:04:15.519 --> 01:04:16.685
[gasp]

01:04:16.687 --> 01:04:18.086
And now is your chance
to have everything

01:04:18.088 --> 01:04:20.255
she always had that you
always felt like you deserved.

01:04:20.257 --> 01:04:21.456
This is brilliant!

01:04:21.458 --> 01:04:23.959
I've always wanted
to play a bad guy.

01:04:23.961 --> 01:04:25.527
Fuck your grandmother.

01:04:25.529 --> 01:04:27.762
Just getting into character.

01:04:27.764 --> 01:04:30.765
Oh, you can't wear that tonight.

01:04:30.767 --> 01:04:31.566
That's good.

01:04:31.568 --> 01:04:33.435
No, that's me.

01:04:33.437 --> 01:04:34.369
Hm.

01:04:34.371 --> 01:04:35.270
Hm?

01:04:35.272 --> 01:04:36.638
Hm?

01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:40.275
I feel like what
I'm wearing is fine.

01:04:40.277 --> 01:04:41.543
It is fine.

01:04:41.545 --> 01:04:46.248
But why have fine when
you can have fabulous?

01:04:46.250 --> 01:04:47.449
OK.

01:04:47.451 --> 01:04:51.353
Pick out anything,
anything you want.

01:04:55.926 --> 01:04:56.691
This?

01:04:59.963 --> 01:05:01.062
OK, honey.

01:05:01.064 --> 01:05:04.599
Um, I see that
you're a lot like me.

01:05:04.601 --> 01:05:05.834
You're in control.

01:05:05.836 --> 01:05:07.602
You know what you want.

01:05:07.604 --> 01:05:09.504
You're ambitious.

01:05:09.506 --> 01:05:13.108
I'd love to see you in something
that shows a little bit more

01:05:13.110 --> 01:05:14.409
of that power.

01:05:14.411 --> 01:05:15.310
Take off your clothes.

01:05:15.312 --> 01:05:18.246
[music playing]

01:05:28.258 --> 01:05:29.157
You have no taste.

01:05:34.097 --> 01:05:37.032
[music playing]

01:05:51.815 --> 01:05:52.781
Wow.

01:05:52.783 --> 01:05:54.716
Mm-hmm.

01:05:54.718 --> 01:05:56.551
You sure about this?

01:05:56.553 --> 01:05:57.519
Mm-hmm.

01:05:57.521 --> 01:05:59.020
Yes.

01:05:59.022 --> 01:06:03.024
You look fabulous.

01:06:03.026 --> 01:06:04.092
We look fabulous.

01:06:07.564 --> 01:06:10.532
[music playing]

01:06:22.913 --> 01:06:24.512
Oh.

01:06:24.514 --> 01:06:27.682
CHARLES: Dodge, it's your call
if you want to invite your mom

01:06:27.684 --> 01:06:28.483
or not.

01:06:28.485 --> 01:06:30.151
No.

01:06:30.153 --> 01:06:32.754
No.

01:06:32.756 --> 01:06:34.322
Absolutely not.

01:06:34.324 --> 01:06:36.558
OK, hang on.

01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:40.729
If our parents liked each
other we could be sisters.

01:06:40.731 --> 01:06:43.932
You do not want
my mom as your mom.

01:06:43.934 --> 01:06:47.268
What do you like about her?

01:06:47.270 --> 01:06:50.872
Is she nice?

01:06:50.874 --> 01:06:53.008
Too nice to the wrong people.

01:06:53.010 --> 01:06:53.975
So she has a big heart.

01:06:56.713 --> 01:07:00.415
Is there anything you like
about yourself that you

01:07:00.417 --> 01:07:01.850
think you got from her?

01:07:01.852 --> 01:07:04.953
Loyalty, I guess.

01:07:04.955 --> 01:07:06.588
Is she funny?

01:07:06.590 --> 01:07:08.923
Not on purpose.

01:07:08.925 --> 01:07:11.426
As someone who didn't
understand how cool their mom

01:07:11.428 --> 01:07:17.098
was until she was gone, I think
you're being a little harsh.

01:07:17.100 --> 01:07:21.169
Can I ask what
happened to her?

01:07:26.743 --> 01:07:29.244
[cell phone buzzing]

01:07:29.246 --> 01:07:31.179
My love, my
heart, my princess.

01:07:35.419 --> 01:07:36.184
No.

01:07:39.222 --> 01:07:44.392
Uh, you know, I have
one other thing earlier.

01:07:44.394 --> 01:07:46.294
But I'm-- what time is it?

01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:51.166
I'm going to make it work.

01:07:51.168 --> 01:07:52.667
So my mom's coming
from an event,

01:07:52.669 --> 01:07:57.772
which means she'll be dressed
in a very intense outfit.

01:07:57.774 --> 01:08:00.408
She has a great singing voice.

01:08:00.410 --> 01:08:01.810
My dad knows how
to play guitar.

01:08:01.812 --> 01:08:03.278
They'll totally fall in love.

01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:04.446
To our potential sisterhood.

01:08:04.448 --> 01:08:05.246
Yeah

01:08:05.248 --> 01:08:06.014
Oh.

01:08:06.016 --> 01:08:08.650
[music playing]

01:08:11.121 --> 01:08:11.986
[chatter]

01:08:11.988 --> 01:08:13.121
PHOTOGRAPHER: This is boring.

01:08:13.123 --> 01:08:14.422
Let's get a kiss.

01:08:14.424 --> 01:08:15.757
Yeah.

01:08:15.759 --> 01:08:17.325
Don't they play father
and daughter on the show?

01:08:17.327 --> 01:08:20.694
Some people will do
anything for attention.

01:08:20.697 --> 01:08:23.331
OK, it's our turn.

01:08:23.332 --> 01:08:24.131
Oh, no.

01:08:24.134 --> 01:08:25.500
No, no.

01:08:25.502 --> 01:08:26.301
Come on.

01:08:26.303 --> 01:08:28.169
Come up and smile.

01:08:28.171 --> 01:08:30.604
PHOTOGRAPHER: Sherrell,
who's your friend?

01:08:30.607 --> 01:08:33.975
Let's get another one like that.

01:08:33.977 --> 01:08:35.542
Sherell, is that your sister?

01:08:35.545 --> 01:08:37.812
SHERRELL: Oh, I don't think so.
PHOTOGRAPHER: Oh, I don't know.

01:08:37.814 --> 01:08:39.013
SHERRELL: Well, ma-- maybe.

01:08:39.015 --> 01:08:40.648
Oh, we miss you already.

01:08:40.649 --> 01:08:41.783
This is red carpet only.

01:08:41.785 --> 01:08:42.550
Oh, no.

01:08:42.551 --> 01:08:43.350
No.

01:08:43.353 --> 01:08:44.285
I'm with them.

01:08:44.287 --> 01:08:45.153
That's my--

01:08:45.154 --> 01:08:46.520
Oh, so great to see you again.

01:08:46.523 --> 01:08:47.689
You look amazing.

01:08:47.691 --> 01:08:48.555
That's my mom.

01:08:48.558 --> 01:08:49.390
Sherrell is my mom.

01:08:49.392 --> 01:08:50.191
All right, ma'am.

01:08:50.193 --> 01:08:51.493
I'm Jackie.

01:08:51.495 --> 01:08:53.060
The regulations entrance
is right over there.

01:08:53.063 --> 01:08:54.629
She's-- can I get in that way?

01:08:54.631 --> 01:08:56.131
These are twins
I just met in line.

01:09:00.203 --> 01:09:02.170
Hello.

01:09:02.171 --> 01:09:04.171
Hi.

01:09:04.174 --> 01:09:06.808
Did you get me one of those?

01:09:06.810 --> 01:09:07.742
This?

01:09:07.743 --> 01:09:08.710
Yeah.

01:09:08.712 --> 01:09:10.211
No, they only gave us two.

01:09:10.212 --> 01:09:11.379
But I don't want it.

01:09:11.381 --> 01:09:12.180
It's fine.

01:09:12.182 --> 01:09:12.981
I don't need it.

01:09:12.983 --> 01:09:14.215
What are you wearing?

01:09:14.216 --> 01:09:15.316
Oh, you made it.

01:09:15.318 --> 01:09:16.084
Hi.

01:09:16.086 --> 01:09:17.318
Hi.

01:09:17.319 --> 01:09:18.987
So this is the one I
was telling you about.

01:09:18.988 --> 01:09:20.688
She is totally brilliant.

01:09:20.689 --> 01:09:22.223
You kneed Brant in the gonads.

01:09:22.225 --> 01:09:24.325
She can be a little intense.

01:09:24.327 --> 01:09:26.895
Intense can be a good thing.

01:09:26.897 --> 01:09:30.198
Why don't you grab us a couple
of whatever the cocktail is?

01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:33.234
So anyway, what I was telling
you is that she [inaudible]..

01:09:33.236 --> 01:09:34.002
Really?

01:09:38.408 --> 01:09:39.407
Party on.

01:09:39.408 --> 01:09:42.310
[music playing]

01:09:49.085 --> 01:09:51.452
[party chatter]

01:09:51.453 --> 01:09:53.787
RACHEL: You don't have to
kill off your older characters

01:09:53.790 --> 01:09:55.190
to keep your show current.

01:09:55.192 --> 01:09:57.692
You just need to be reflecting
the current reality.

01:09:57.694 --> 01:09:59.260
You're smart.

01:09:59.262 --> 01:10:01.029
Isn't she great?

01:10:01.031 --> 01:10:02.430
Because the
younger generations,

01:10:02.432 --> 01:10:03.865
they want to see dynamic women.

01:10:03.867 --> 01:10:05.233
And they want to
see older women.

01:10:05.235 --> 01:10:06.734
Well, not older, older.

01:10:06.736 --> 01:10:08.770
RACHEL: But the point
is, Miranda is someone

01:10:08.772 --> 01:10:12.373
we only know as a mother,
and as somebody's ex.

01:10:12.375 --> 01:10:13.875
Right?
We know nothing about her.

01:10:13.877 --> 01:10:15.276
But with the evil
twin character,

01:10:15.278 --> 01:10:19.080
you have a real opportunity
to flesh out this three

01:10:19.082 --> 01:10:20.782
dimensional, deeply flawed--

01:10:20.784 --> 01:10:22.550
But in a sexy way.

01:10:22.552 --> 01:10:23.318
I like that.

01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:24.219
JACKIE: Good evening.

01:10:24.221 --> 01:10:25.053
Good evening.

01:10:25.055 --> 01:10:26.287
Here are your drinks.

01:10:26.289 --> 01:10:29.123
The bartender is a
B-I-T-C-H, for the record.

01:10:29.125 --> 01:10:31.559
Where did you go
to school, Rachel?

01:10:31.561 --> 01:10:33.294
I got into the
University of Chicago.

01:10:33.296 --> 01:10:35.463
RACHEL: Yeah, but you didn't go.

01:10:35.465 --> 01:10:37.632
Was unable to attend.

01:10:37.634 --> 01:10:40.134
Have you ever
considered acting?

01:10:40.136 --> 01:10:42.770
You really have a
face for television.

01:10:42.772 --> 01:10:44.272
Oh.

01:10:44.274 --> 01:10:47.408
Maybe the evil twin has a
daughter, like actor, writer,

01:10:47.410 --> 01:10:49.811
mother, daughter duo.

01:10:49.813 --> 01:10:50.979
That's good.

01:10:50.981 --> 01:10:53.248
Then you guys can
start an evil empire.

01:10:53.250 --> 01:10:54.449
Cool.

01:10:54.451 --> 01:10:57.151
Jackie seems to be
enjoying the open bar.

01:10:57.153 --> 01:10:58.019
Where were we?

01:10:58.021 --> 01:11:00.321
Oh, right.

01:11:00.323 --> 01:11:01.322
Girl power.

01:11:05.161 --> 01:11:07.795
I just think you should have
a female character on your show

01:11:07.797 --> 01:11:09.330
who isn't perfect.

01:11:09.332 --> 01:11:12.500
But in an appealing way.

01:11:12.502 --> 01:11:13.835
Sexy works.

01:11:13.837 --> 01:11:15.436
Sexy is important.

01:11:15.438 --> 01:11:17.171
DODGE: Now you want
to hear all the things

01:11:17.173 --> 01:11:19.941
I don't like about my mom?

01:11:19.943 --> 01:11:21.442
She's always late.

01:11:21.444 --> 01:11:23.811
I'm pretty sure she
can't tell time.

01:11:23.813 --> 01:11:26.347
She's overly
emotional and needy.

01:11:26.349 --> 01:11:27.982
She pretends to have
hobbies, but never

01:11:27.984 --> 01:11:29.450
actually learns to do anything.

01:11:29.452 --> 01:11:31.019
She wants to be
part of everything

01:11:31.021 --> 01:11:32.520
until she has
something better to do.

01:11:32.522 --> 01:11:33.855
And then she's like, oh, sorry.

01:11:33.857 --> 01:11:35.023
I forgot.

01:11:35.025 --> 01:11:36.291
CHARLES: You ever
thought about talking

01:11:36.293 --> 01:11:38.059
to your mom about
how annoying she is?

01:11:38.061 --> 01:11:38.860
No.

01:11:38.862 --> 01:11:41.296
No, I can't.

01:11:41.298 --> 01:11:42.497
You sure?

01:11:42.499 --> 01:11:45.400
You keep pressing this
kind of stuff down,

01:11:45.402 --> 01:11:48.036
it festers and it grows.

01:11:48.038 --> 01:11:51.472
And before you know
it, you are doing

01:11:51.474 --> 01:11:53.808
something you really regret.

01:11:53.810 --> 01:11:54.575
Like what?

01:11:58.715 --> 01:11:59.547
CHARLES: Take a look.

01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:07.055
Stronger on my knees.

01:12:07.057 --> 01:12:07.889
Oh.

01:12:07.891 --> 01:12:08.723
[laughs]

01:12:08.725 --> 01:12:11.659
That's kind of homoerotic.

01:12:11.661 --> 01:12:15.563
Try play intramural basketball
with that shit in your back.

01:12:15.565 --> 01:12:17.732
Yeah, that's what I did
instead of talking to my dad.

01:12:17.734 --> 01:12:19.233
Are you going to
get a face tattoo

01:12:19.235 --> 01:12:20.468
instead of talking about mom?

01:12:32.382 --> 01:12:33.815
Are you going to go?

01:12:36.786 --> 01:12:37.785
[door slams]

01:12:37.787 --> 01:12:38.653
I'll go.

01:12:53.703 --> 01:12:56.637
[party chatter]

inherited a bunch of debt.

01:14:42.412 --> 01:14:43.711

If you see a person repeatedly
walking into traffic,

I'm a blind person?

01:15:51.180 --> 01:15:54.815

and I know that I'm not

all the people around me

feel OK in the world.

01:16:08.831 --> 01:16:11.165

that's what you do.

Michael is very into our pitch.

01:16:45.335 --> 01:16:48.035
He wants us to come back to
his place and keep talking.

01:16:48.037 --> 01:16:49.704

you about something.

It's a permit for the theater.

Oh, thank god.

01:17:16.399 --> 01:17:18.733
I switched business managers,
and I was so worried

01:17:18.735 --> 01:17:21.602
that there would be a problem
with the payment or something.

01:17:21.604 --> 01:17:23.604
Easy, peasy.

01:17:23.606 --> 01:17:25.072
What payment?

01:17:25.074 --> 01:17:28.776
Well, the mortgage,
the property taxes,

01:17:28.778 --> 01:17:30.578
the expenses on the building.

01:17:30.580 --> 01:17:32.713

01:17:32.715 --> 01:17:36.083

those payments?

Well, I wouldn't expect
your father to make them.

01:17:42.291 --> 01:17:45.860
He was so committed to his
starving artist persona.

01:17:45.862 --> 01:17:49.964

leave you high and dry.

Can we not talk about
this right here, right now?

Do you know how any idea how
fucked up I am because of you?

have two parents because I

01:27:10.960 --> 01:27:13.260
So I did some thinking, and
I figured out a way for us

01:27:13.262 --> 01:27:17.097
to keep the theater for
the play if we rent out

01:27:17.099 --> 01:27:19.633
a couple of rooms, we
set up a payment plan.

01:27:19.635 --> 01:27:21.602
We'll have enough money
to get through casting,

01:27:21.604 --> 01:27:23.637
and then assuming the
play's a huge hit,

01:27:23.639 --> 01:27:26.974
you, me, and Dodge
will find a new place.

01:27:26.976 --> 01:27:28.609
