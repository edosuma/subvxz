A NETFLIX SERIES

00:13.583 --> 00:16.041
So what do you guys think?

00:16.125 --> 00:17.416
It's looking great.

00:17.500 --> 00:19.041
-Beautiful.
-It's awesome.

00:19.125 --> 00:22.041
We're wrapping up
with the painting tomorrow,

00:22.125 --> 00:23.375
and it'll be ready.

00:23.458 --> 00:24.666
Remember that game

00:24.750 --> 00:27.291
of popping a balloon and reading a verse?

00:27.375 --> 00:30.375
Yeah! I've got many memories
from that time.

00:30.875 --> 00:33.041
Bible study, music classes.

00:33.125 --> 00:35.083
-Do you remember, Nando?
-Sure do.

00:35.666 --> 00:42.416
PENTECOSTAL CHURCH
MINISTRY OF GRACE AND WORSHIP

00:50.583 --> 00:51.541
Check this out.

00:53.500 --> 00:56.958
God is among us

00:57.041 --> 00:58.666
Hallelujah

00:58.750 --> 01:03.291
As much as the air I breathe

01:04.000 --> 01:09.291
As much as the sun is rising tomorrow

01:09.375 --> 01:14.833
As much as I speak and you hear me

01:14.916 --> 01:18.083
God is among us

01:18.166 --> 01:19.791
Hallelujah

01:19.875 --> 01:24.458
As much as the air I breathe

01:24.958 --> 01:29.541
As much as the sun is rising tomorrow

01:29.625 --> 01:34.625
As much as I speak and you hear me

01:35.125 --> 01:37.750
As much as I speak

01:37.833 --> 01:40.583
As much as I speak

01:40.666 --> 01:43.000
As much as I speak

01:43.083 --> 01:45.583
And you hear me

01:52.333 --> 01:53.958
BASED ON THE ORIGINAL IDEA
BY KONDZILLA

01:54.041 --> 01:56.583
Uncle Chico once told me that I was strong

01:56.666 --> 01:58.125
but had to find my path.

01:58.791 --> 02:01.750
-The old man was the shit.
-Yeah, he was.

02:02.916 --> 02:05.916
I prayed so much to God. I begged him.

02:06.000 --> 02:10.166
And he used Pastor Sueli,
Josué, Levi, and this church

02:10.250 --> 02:13.041
to show me
I don't have to be like my father.

02:13.125 --> 02:15.958
Enough of that Ritinha.
I have a purpose now.

02:16.458 --> 02:19.958
I want to bring more souls to Jesus
because he trusted me.

02:20.041 --> 02:21.583
You're right.

02:22.375 --> 02:25.000
-I have your cash here.
-Yeah, right.

02:25.500 --> 02:28.083
-Three hundred?
-Yes. Thanks, brother.

02:28.166 --> 02:31.458
No worries. Let me know
if you need anything else.

02:31.541 --> 02:33.500
-Always.
-Is everything set?

02:33.583 --> 02:36.625
Yes. I'm organizing the concert.

02:36.708 --> 02:39.208
Levi got the band. Now we need the singer.

02:39.291 --> 02:40.458
You two are coming, right?

02:40.958 --> 02:43.416
Yeah. What if I sing at the opening?

02:44.083 --> 02:45.583
No funk, just gospel.

02:46.375 --> 02:47.708
You won't blow me off?

02:47.791 --> 02:48.750
-No.
-I hope not.

02:48.833 --> 02:50.000
SAME TIME AND PLACE

02:50.083 --> 02:51.541
-Trust me.
-Alright.

02:51.625 --> 02:52.500
Guys,

02:53.208 --> 02:54.083
I gotta go.

02:54.166 --> 02:56.375
-Tomorrow, right?
-The day after.

02:56.958 --> 02:58.833
-The day after tomorrow.
-Deal.

02:58.916 --> 03:01.000
Listen, every time I'm scared

03:01.083 --> 03:03.625
and I look at you,
I know it's gonna be okay.

03:05.041 --> 03:06.541
I need this to go well.

03:09.083 --> 03:10.916
It's my chance, brother.

03:14.583 --> 03:15.458
It will go well.

03:16.416 --> 03:18.416
-I'll be here, okay?
-Okay.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.041
-See you, bro.
-Later, man.

03:25.625 --> 03:28.250
-Just one funk song?
-I'll rip you to pieces!

03:46.333 --> 03:47.291
What's up?

03:49.083 --> 03:50.458
Hey, partner. All good?

03:50.541 --> 03:52.416
-Yeah. You?
-Here.

03:53.791 --> 03:57.000
These guys have been doing this
for some time.

03:58.375 --> 04:01.333
They make money and hurt the competition.

04:02.041 --> 04:03.625
I know this motherfucker.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.958
-Anyone else know about this?
-No.

04:10.041 --> 04:11.166
That's all I know.

04:12.166 --> 04:15.125
-That's fucked up.
-Fucking Lindão.

04:15.208 --> 04:18.291
You take it from here.
This is family business.

04:18.375 --> 04:19.750
My family or yours?

04:26.166 --> 04:27.833
BRO, WE'RE FUCKED

04:29.833 --> 04:31.875
MEET ME AT THE GARAGE

04:31.958 --> 04:33.833
Hey, listen up.

04:33.916 --> 04:36.833
Don't go looking for trouble
with those guys.

04:37.416 --> 04:39.666
They are psychos, man.

04:40.250 --> 04:42.000
They're well connected.

04:42.083 --> 04:44.333
If you go after them, you're fucked.

04:44.416 --> 04:45.708
I'll be fucked too.

04:55.125 --> 04:56.125
I've warned you.

04:59.750 --> 05:02.875
Doni, you caught us by surprise.
A church event?

05:02.958 --> 05:06.416
We already have two gigs
booked for the day.

05:06.500 --> 05:09.500
One is in São José dos Campos.
How far is that?

05:09.583 --> 05:11.666
It's about two hours away.

05:11.750 --> 05:14.875
The booker is that guy
who calls a ten-minute delay

05:14.958 --> 05:16.208
a breach of contract.

05:16.291 --> 05:19.041
It won't be long.
It's just a few hymns, right?

05:19.125 --> 05:22.041
But we don't know
what kind of structure they got.

05:23.375 --> 05:25.416
But we can make it work.

05:25.958 --> 05:27.625
The organizer is my sister.

05:27.708 --> 05:29.625
Marcão can send you her number.

05:29.708 --> 05:31.375
Nothing will go wrong.

05:31.458 --> 05:34.083
Doni, we're not trying to hold you back.

05:34.166 --> 05:36.416
But we agreed you'd do a collab first.

05:36.500 --> 05:40.333
You can do a nice church gig
down the road, okay?

05:40.416 --> 05:42.250
I know you're in a hurry, Luan.

05:42.333 --> 05:45.291
But I started singing in the church.

05:45.375 --> 05:47.583
There were many talented kids there.

05:47.666 --> 05:50.041
But not everyone gets a chance.

05:50.541 --> 05:53.708
It's not just a church gig.
It means a lot to me.

05:55.458 --> 05:57.000
Okay, let's make it work.

05:57.083 --> 05:59.416
But we can't miss the other two gigs.

05:59.500 --> 06:01.250
Be good to Marcão, Doni.

06:01.333 --> 06:04.416
There's a line of artists
dying to work with him.

06:05.041 --> 06:07.458
And get your vocal cords ready.

06:07.541 --> 06:10.833
Gospel music requires a lot of voice.

06:24.333 --> 06:26.791
Son of a bitch. Look.

06:30.041 --> 06:31.833
-Scumbag.
-What's this, man?

06:32.833 --> 06:34.708
What's up? I don't get it.

06:34.791 --> 06:35.833
That's right.

06:36.333 --> 06:39.791
Lindão's got to explain to the family
what is going on.

06:39.875 --> 06:43.833
To hell with talking to this guy.
What else is there to know?

06:44.458 --> 06:47.416
This piece of shit fucked us over.

06:47.500 --> 06:49.208
You know what to do.

06:49.291 --> 06:51.625
The pictures alone aren't enough.

06:51.708 --> 06:53.875
If we call him, he'll run away.

06:53.958 --> 06:56.500
We kidnap him and take care of it.

06:56.583 --> 06:58.208
Off him if we have to.

06:58.291 --> 06:59.791
I'm with Messinho.

06:59.875 --> 07:03.666
We should smoke everyone
involved in this shit.

07:03.750 --> 07:05.000
They deserve it.

07:05.083 --> 07:06.333
Slow down.

07:06.416 --> 07:08.541
We gotta think this through.

07:08.625 --> 07:11.125
The cops are in it with them.

07:11.208 --> 07:13.416
We gotta be careful or it'll backfire.

07:13.500 --> 07:15.500
You think that piece of shit

07:15.583 --> 07:18.000
stole the drugs to supply his shop?

07:18.083 --> 07:21.083
There's more people involved.
Not just the cops.

07:21.166 --> 07:22.833
We're in the right, brother.

07:22.916 --> 07:25.333
Get ready. They're gonna come after us.

07:25.416 --> 07:28.791
The evidence is here.
We deal with him. If someone asks,

07:28.875 --> 07:30.375
we show the evidence.

07:30.958 --> 07:31.916
No chit-chat.

07:55.041 --> 07:56.375
Your head is smoking.

07:58.458 --> 08:00.083
I didn't see you there.

08:04.041 --> 08:05.625
I wanted to ask you…

08:06.416 --> 08:09.125
How are your parents? Are they mad at me?

08:09.208 --> 08:10.875
-No.
-Are you sure, Levi?

08:10.958 --> 08:13.208
-It's fine, Rita.
-I was so worried!

08:13.750 --> 08:16.041
I wouldn't be able
to look them in the eye.

08:16.625 --> 08:20.458
They were mad we just vanished.
I had to tell them.

08:22.166 --> 08:24.166
Auntie Lu felt sick.

08:24.250 --> 08:27.208
We got worried and left in a hurry.

08:27.875 --> 08:31.125
Thank God we took her to the ER in time.

08:31.208 --> 08:34.333
High blood pressure is a serious thing.

08:34.416 --> 08:36.041
Is it, Levi?

08:37.583 --> 08:39.041
MOM
MESSAGE RECEIVED

08:39.125 --> 08:40.125
Look.

08:41.041 --> 08:43.208
She's asking what time I'm coming,

08:43.291 --> 08:46.250
if I need the driver,
if I think people will come.

08:46.333 --> 08:48.125
-She runs a tight ship.
-Yep.

08:49.041 --> 08:51.583
With Doni playing,
we'll have a full house.

08:52.166 --> 08:53.291
Speaking of which,

08:53.958 --> 08:56.916
I gotta rent a more powerful sound system.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.083
How much would it be?

08:58.166 --> 09:00.791
No idea, but I know someone who can help.

09:01.291 --> 09:03.791
-Miro, ever heard of him?
-Oh, Miro!

09:03.875 --> 09:06.291
-I've heard of him.
-He's a great guy.

09:07.125 --> 09:09.833
-Give me his number, then.
-You got it.

09:13.958 --> 09:17.375
And that question you asked God
about the right person?

09:19.875 --> 09:21.750
Come look, Rita.

09:22.250 --> 09:24.166
It's getting beautiful.

09:24.250 --> 09:26.416
-I'll be right there.
-Looking great!

09:27.625 --> 09:31.583
JOHN 8:32

09:47.583 --> 09:51.583
Receive the cure

09:52.375 --> 09:55.833
Receive the anointing

09:58.000 --> 10:01.458
Anointing of boldness

10:01.541 --> 10:04.250
Anointing of victory

10:04.750 --> 10:08.000
Anointing of multiplication

10:08.083 --> 10:11.166
It sounds so beautiful, son!

10:11.250 --> 10:13.458
That was your dad's favorite hymn.

10:13.541 --> 10:16.250
-It's really beautiful. Go on.
-Have faith.

10:16.333 --> 10:20.125
Auntie, sure you don't need
any help at the store?

10:20.208 --> 10:21.750
Rivaldo can help you.

10:21.833 --> 10:24.500
Yeah, I can spend the day with you there.

10:24.583 --> 10:27.250
Thank you, boys. But it's not necessary.

10:28.083 --> 10:30.666
You're role models to the kids out there.

10:30.750 --> 10:32.541
You made it doing the right thing.

10:33.541 --> 10:35.041
Is Luiz Fernando going?

10:35.541 --> 10:37.791
He said he would, but you never know.

10:39.333 --> 10:40.500
Won't you eat?

10:41.250 --> 10:42.708
I gotta rehearse.

10:42.791 --> 10:45.541
I'll change the song tone to fit my range.

10:45.625 --> 10:48.291
-Can't wait for the singing lessons.
-Relax.

10:48.375 --> 10:49.708
You'll do great.

10:50.958 --> 10:52.125
Hey.

10:52.208 --> 10:54.833
Look who's messaging me
and commenting on my photos.

10:54.916 --> 10:55.916
Tally.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.375
THOSE TEETH ARE CUTE

10:57.458 --> 10:59.083
She's so cute.

10:59.166 --> 11:01.500
She's been ghosting me.

11:01.583 --> 11:04.375
That girl who was here the other morning?

11:04.458 --> 11:05.791
Yeah, Auntie.

11:05.875 --> 11:08.500
It's the girl who Doni's got a crush on.

11:10.666 --> 11:13.000
Invite her over for lunch.

11:13.083 --> 11:16.125
I've been sending emojis,
but she doesn't reply.

11:16.208 --> 11:17.625
Maybe she's not into me.

11:18.291 --> 11:19.500
Emoji?

11:19.583 --> 11:21.833
Yeah, Auntie. The smileys on WhatsApp.

11:21.916 --> 11:24.708
Doni keeps texting her
with a bunch of these.

11:25.291 --> 11:27.291
All they do is crash the phone.

11:27.375 --> 11:28.625
Enough, Jaspion.

11:28.708 --> 11:31.125
Son, boys like these things.

11:31.208 --> 11:32.541
Girls are not like that.

11:33.291 --> 11:35.541
Call her, open your heart,

11:35.625 --> 11:37.333
tell her how you feel.

11:37.416 --> 11:40.375
I bet Rose tells you boys
the same thing, right?

11:49.291 --> 11:52.541
-Nice to see you.
-My pleasure.

11:52.625 --> 11:53.500
All good?

12:00.625 --> 12:01.458
Yo, family.

12:01.541 --> 12:03.291
Hey, Badá. Greetings, bro.

12:03.375 --> 12:04.833
Awesome, family.

12:04.916 --> 12:08.541
Firstly, I'd like to salute everyone.

12:08.625 --> 12:10.000
-Greetings.
-Thanks.

12:10.583 --> 12:12.541
So Lindão is quick?

12:12.625 --> 12:16.125
But he knows.
We're gonna get to him at the right time.

12:16.208 --> 12:18.625
But we gotta make a move now.

12:18.708 --> 12:21.375
We don't know who's siding with him.

12:21.458 --> 12:24.333
Nowadays, you can't trust anyone.

12:24.416 --> 12:26.375
We're deliberating about his life

12:26.458 --> 12:29.083
because we know
what it's like to take one.

12:29.166 --> 12:32.000
But that's it. We do what's right.

12:32.083 --> 12:34.833
My boy is right, got it?

12:34.916 --> 12:38.750
No matter who it is,
you betray the family, you die.

12:38.833 --> 12:40.333
We take our rifles, right?

12:41.166 --> 12:43.625
So we don't waste our time
if the car is armored.

12:43.708 --> 12:46.708
I need your help
with a ride and two rifles.

12:46.791 --> 12:49.083
My guy tails them on a bike.

12:49.166 --> 12:51.541
-It's checkmate for him then.
-Let's roll.

12:56.291 --> 12:59.958
It looks great! I really like it.

13:00.041 --> 13:01.750
That's great, Josué!

13:01.833 --> 13:05.125
It reminds me of the church
where I met my wife 30 years ago.

13:06.250 --> 13:08.250
Back when life was simpler.

13:08.833 --> 13:10.208
Good times.

13:10.750 --> 13:13.291
That's when I met your father.
Did you know?

13:13.375 --> 13:15.000
I've heard that one before.

13:15.666 --> 13:18.125
As agreed, here's the last check.

13:18.708 --> 13:19.583
Thank you.

13:19.666 --> 13:21.166
Look who's coming!

13:22.416 --> 13:25.458
Pastor Sueli, Rita,
this is my goddaughter Laura.

13:25.541 --> 13:27.333
-God be with you.
-Amen.

13:27.416 --> 13:28.666
Amen.

13:28.750 --> 13:30.875
-I know this one.
-Hi, Laura.

13:31.708 --> 13:32.708
Hi.

13:33.208 --> 13:36.541
See what a divine work
they did in this church?

13:36.625 --> 13:38.333
-It's true.
-Beautiful, right?

13:38.833 --> 13:40.291
RECEIPT

13:57.166 --> 13:59.541
Don't you want to do this some other time?

13:59.625 --> 14:03.041
I'll help you with the books
after the opening.

14:03.125 --> 14:05.041
We have a long day tomorrow.

14:05.125 --> 14:08.166
Just a few more minutes.
You can go. I'll lock up.

14:09.708 --> 14:12.416
If your mother were here,
she'd be happy to see

14:12.500 --> 14:14.083
the woman you've become.

14:17.125 --> 14:18.750
What's bugging you, child?

14:20.208 --> 14:23.291
I can't make a mistake.
Everything's gotta be right.

14:23.375 --> 14:25.708
-Rita, you're not your father.
-I know.

14:26.375 --> 14:29.750
-What if people think I am?
-There's no reason to.

14:29.833 --> 14:31.375
If they do, I'll have your back.

14:32.458 --> 14:35.500
God knows your heart better.
That's what matters.

14:36.833 --> 14:39.208
-Don't stay too late.
-I won't.

14:39.291 --> 14:40.875
-Get some rest.
-Will do.

14:48.958 --> 14:51.750
MESSAGE RECEIVED

14:51.833 --> 14:55.208
MY DAD JUST SAID HE'S GOING
WITH THE MANAGING PASTORS.

14:55.291 --> 14:59.875

15:07.833 --> 15:10.916
Hello. This is Rita, from the church.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.541
I called yesterday.

15:12.625 --> 15:13.708
Right.

15:14.750 --> 15:16.250
I've changed my mind.

15:16.958 --> 15:19.875
I want to rent
the more powerful equipment.

15:19.958 --> 15:21.375
One thousand, right?

15:26.750 --> 15:28.833
If they tried

15:28.916 --> 15:31.833
To kill your dreams

15:32.333 --> 15:37.041
By suffocating your heart

15:37.583 --> 15:42.625
If they threw you in a grave

15:42.708 --> 15:47.416
And hurt, you lost your sight

15:47.500 --> 15:49.791
-Let's try a little vibrato.
-Okay.

15:49.875 --> 15:53.833
And hurt, you lost your sight

15:53.916 --> 15:54.958
Great.

15:55.041 --> 16:00.250
And hurt, you lost your sight

16:00.333 --> 16:01.375
Yeah!

16:01.458 --> 16:05.875
-Don't give up
-Don't stop believing

16:05.958 --> 16:11.666
God's dreams will never wither

16:11.750 --> 16:16.375
Don't give up
Don't stop fighting

16:16.458 --> 16:19.833
Don't stop praising

16:20.416 --> 16:23.583
Look up and see

16:23.666 --> 16:24.958
That God is…

16:25.041 --> 16:29.750
That God is restoring your dreams

16:29.833 --> 16:31.500
And your sight. Vibrato.

16:31.583 --> 16:36.416
And your sight

16:38.291 --> 16:40.791
-I go high now?
-Yes. Receive…

16:41.583 --> 16:46.458

Anointing of boldness.

17:22.541 --> 17:24.666
Anointing of boldness

17:24.750 --> 17:27.250
Anointing of victory

17:27.333 --> 17:30.416
Anointing of multiplication

17:30.500 --> 17:32.416
Last one to close it out.

17:32.500 --> 17:34.833
Anointing of boldness

17:35.333 --> 17:37.916
Anointing of victory

17:38.000 --> 17:42.416

17:44.291 --> 17:46.583
Yeah! Well done!

17:46.666 --> 17:50.041
Man, your voice has a great rasp to it.

17:50.125 --> 17:51.416
-It's dope.
-Thanks.

17:51.500 --> 17:54.375
You gotta explore that, man.
It's fantastic.

17:54.458 --> 17:57.166
By the way,
what you're doing is beautiful.

17:57.250 --> 18:01.041
An artist of your stature
making time to sing in church.

18:01.125 --> 18:02.875
Songs for God. It's great.

18:02.958 --> 18:05.083
Do you know what would be cool?

18:05.166 --> 18:06.125
What?

18:07.375 --> 18:09.625
Maybe you'd like to sing with me?

18:09.708 --> 18:10.875
In the hood?

18:10.958 --> 18:12.333
-Are you down?
-Totally!

18:12.416 --> 18:13.583
-Really?
-Super!

18:13.666 --> 18:16.750
-Alright, then.
-Yeah, I better get prepared.

18:16.833 --> 18:20.666
Receive the cure

18:23.083 --> 18:25.166
Let's sing another one?

18:26.833 --> 18:29.166
-Let's sing, honey?
-Sing for us.

18:29.250 --> 18:34.625
The itsy-bitsy spider
Climbed up the water spout

18:34.708 --> 18:37.708
-Tired of playing, honey?
-I'm sleepy, Daddy.

18:38.291 --> 18:41.041
-She's tired.
-Come to bed.

18:41.125 --> 18:42.500
I'll take her.

18:43.750 --> 18:44.625
Come.

18:49.958 --> 18:51.375
Did she fall asleep?

18:51.458 --> 18:52.458
Yep.

18:54.375 --> 18:55.500
In a heartbeat.

18:56.000 --> 18:56.875
Great.

18:57.375 --> 18:58.208
Tired?

18:59.541 --> 19:01.250
Playing games is exhausting.

19:02.416 --> 19:05.083
We could get some rest too.

19:09.416 --> 19:11.250
Where are your thoughts?

19:12.208 --> 19:13.333
Far ahead.

19:14.083 --> 19:17.000
There's no need.
We have everything we need here.

19:18.291 --> 19:19.416
And here.

19:20.875 --> 19:22.333
What will he grow up to be?

19:22.833 --> 19:23.833
Whatever he wants.

19:26.375 --> 19:29.583
I've got some stuff to settle,
but I'll soon drop out of this.

19:30.916 --> 19:33.125
I'll invest in something for our future.

19:35.875 --> 19:36.875
He's big, huh?

19:38.208 --> 19:41.083
The belly grows faster
after the first baby.

19:42.833 --> 19:43.916
Soccer player.

19:48.208 --> 19:50.041
Did you give it a look?

19:50.125 --> 19:51.875
Did you see who bought a lot?

19:51.958 --> 19:53.666
-Nando?
-Yeah.

19:54.291 --> 19:55.625
I'm so happy, sis.

19:56.208 --> 19:59.250
Bro, did you notice how happy Ritinha is?

19:59.333 --> 20:00.875
Me too. I'm nervous.

20:00.958 --> 20:03.500
This church makes me feel up in heaven.

20:03.583 --> 20:05.875
And I'm in the clouds!

20:06.625 --> 20:07.541
Hey!

20:07.625 --> 20:09.958
Jaspion, can you test the mic for me?

20:10.041 --> 20:11.708
Right away, Ritinha.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.541
Sound. Testing. It's perfect.

20:15.625 --> 20:19.166
Is it? Let's take a selfie
to mark this moment.

20:20.291 --> 20:21.458
Beautiful!

20:23.166 --> 20:24.958
Nice job with the balloons.

20:25.458 --> 20:26.666
Ritinha deserves it.

20:26.750 --> 20:28.458
WHAT TIME ARE YOU COMING?

20:28.541 --> 20:30.583
She does. Do you need help?

20:30.666 --> 20:33.083
We're just trying to take this back.

20:35.791 --> 20:39.333
I'M COMING WITH MY PARENTS
AND WITH JOSUÉ'S FAMILY

20:39.416 --> 20:41.625
SEE YOU LATER

20:50.583 --> 20:52.041
Another broadcast?

20:52.125 --> 20:54.833
I have a photo shoot.
I'm in the dressing room.

20:55.583 --> 20:56.583
Where are you?

20:56.666 --> 20:58.583
Where I was born. Look.

20:59.083 --> 21:02.000
Back there is the grocery shop
my mom runs.

21:02.583 --> 21:04.083
I wrote my songs here.

21:04.166 --> 21:07.458
I didn't picture it like this.
Looks like a small town.

21:08.875 --> 21:10.166
I wanna see you, Tally.

21:10.750 --> 21:12.666
There's a party tomorrow

21:12.750 --> 21:15.416
after my friend's fashion show.
Wanna come?

21:15.500 --> 21:17.541
How about something more intimate?

21:17.625 --> 21:20.375
Maybe get some dinner. What do you think?

21:21.916 --> 21:23.250
I'm free after this.

21:23.791 --> 21:25.166
I'm kinda busy tonight.

21:25.250 --> 21:27.875
I'm singing hymns at the church.

21:28.625 --> 21:31.333
Wow, Doni! I didn't know that side of you.

21:31.833 --> 21:32.750
Cute.

21:33.250 --> 21:35.125
And I like that you called me.

21:35.625 --> 21:38.541
I'll call every day, then.
Until we meet again.

21:39.125 --> 21:41.458
Really? I'll be waiting.

21:43.333 --> 21:44.291
Deal.

22:00.041 --> 22:01.041
Come on.

22:03.875 --> 22:05.541
Be on alert, brother.

22:05.625 --> 22:07.458
Jump out on my mark.

22:10.583 --> 22:12.625
Caneta will get you out.

22:14.416 --> 22:15.750
We've only got one chance.

22:16.583 --> 22:19.125
Light them up, step out, and shoot again.

22:20.083 --> 22:23.083
Mourners will have to cry
over a closed casket.

22:23.916 --> 22:24.791
Right on.

22:39.375 --> 22:45.125
PENTECOSTAL CHURCH
MINISTRY OF GRACE AND WORSHIP

22:45.208 --> 22:47.958

22:48.041 --> 22:51.166
-Full house, what a blessing.
-Tell me about it.

22:51.250 --> 22:54.875
I feel that God is going to do
great things in this place.

22:54.958 --> 22:57.166
-Amen.
-Great work.

22:57.250 --> 23:01.458

23:01.541 --> 23:04.083
-Well done, Rita.
-Congratulations.

23:04.166 --> 23:05.166
You were of great help.

23:09.708 --> 23:12.041
I'll be right back. Thanks for coming.

23:13.541 --> 23:15.333
I'm so happy you guys came, Nando.

23:17.375 --> 23:19.000
-How are you?
-Very excited.

23:19.083 --> 23:20.916
-Hey, Scheyla.
-Hi, Ritinha.

23:21.625 --> 23:23.375
I saved you a seat.

23:23.458 --> 23:24.916
-Let's go. Thank you.
-Alright.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.625
-It's Auntie!
-Fernando!

23:27.708 --> 23:29.458
Hey. I'm glad you came.

23:29.541 --> 23:31.958
How could I not? I'll sit right here.

23:32.041 --> 23:33.666
-Sure. Go ahead.
-Thanks.

23:33.750 --> 23:36.541
-I'll take care of her.
-Go with the other kids.

23:36.625 --> 23:37.708
Go, honey.

23:39.500 --> 23:42.291
We have candy. You're gonna love it.

23:46.250 --> 23:49.208
-It's looking great, right?
-Yes, it's beautiful.

23:49.291 --> 23:50.666
-Congrats.
-Thanks.

23:50.750 --> 23:53.083
I'll let you know before the last hymn.

23:53.166 --> 23:54.375
Okay. Is Ton here?

23:54.458 --> 23:56.375
Yeah, he's changing.

23:56.458 --> 23:58.875
Listen, the van is gonna be waiting.

23:58.958 --> 24:01.416
Don't be late. Luan's in our hair.

24:01.500 --> 24:02.958
-Alright.
-Cool.

24:03.041 --> 24:04.458
-Marcão!
-Shoot.

24:04.541 --> 24:06.833
-You forgot something.
-What, man?

24:07.416 --> 24:08.916
Where's that great smile?

24:10.750 --> 24:11.625
Alright.

24:12.333 --> 24:13.333
You clown.

24:15.625 --> 24:16.541
Hi, Son.

24:17.750 --> 24:19.916
Just wanted to kiss you good luck.

24:20.458 --> 24:21.708
You're looking great.

24:22.500 --> 24:23.416
You know,

24:24.083 --> 24:27.750
sometimes we mothers
love our kids so much,

24:28.541 --> 24:30.916
we forget to tell them.

24:34.500 --> 24:35.708
My baby boy,

24:36.958 --> 24:38.708
I'm so proud of you.

24:40.125 --> 24:41.291
So proud!

24:41.375 --> 24:42.875
Stop it.

24:46.166 --> 24:49.666
-Do I look okay?
-You look great. So handsome.

24:51.541 --> 24:56.375
My dear and beloved brothers and sisters,

24:56.458 --> 24:58.041
may the Lord be with you.

24:58.125 --> 24:59.208
Amen!

24:59.291 --> 25:00.541
Let us pray.

25:01.541 --> 25:02.541
Dear Lord,

25:03.375 --> 25:08.666
we are now gathered to glorify
your holy presence

25:08.750 --> 25:12.750
and thank you for this new temple

25:12.833 --> 25:14.333
you have given us.

25:15.416 --> 25:17.708
To thank you, in the name of Jesus,

25:17.791 --> 25:20.083
for the opportunity you give us

25:20.708 --> 25:22.416
to carry out your work.

25:23.291 --> 25:24.416
To believe,

25:26.333 --> 25:28.083
to work,

25:28.583 --> 25:30.500
to have courage.

25:31.041 --> 25:32.791
May you let us, Lord,

25:33.291 --> 25:35.416
grow your flock.

25:35.500 --> 25:37.333
Hallelujah.

25:37.416 --> 25:39.250
May we bring

25:39.333 --> 25:42.916
new brothers and sisters in Christ.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.291
Hallelujah.

25:44.916 --> 25:46.958
And when our brethren

25:47.041 --> 25:49.625
walk through that door,

25:49.708 --> 25:54.500
may they be transformed
by the power of your glory!

25:54.583 --> 25:55.708
Glory be to God!

25:59.541 --> 26:01.333
Amen, brethren!

26:01.416 --> 26:02.375
Amen!

26:03.500 --> 26:04.875
Amen, brethren.

26:08.416 --> 26:10.833
-May the Lord be with you.
-Amen.

26:10.916 --> 26:14.666
Brothers, sisters, friends.

26:14.750 --> 26:17.625
We are opening a home

26:17.708 --> 26:20.125
built by the hands of many.

26:20.208 --> 26:23.791
I can see so many people
that have helped me build this.

26:23.875 --> 26:27.000
So many well-intentioned hearts,

26:27.833 --> 26:30.666
guided and blessed by our Lord.

26:30.750 --> 26:34.541
Hey, Tally. I'm at the church.
Slightly different outfit tonight.

26:34.625 --> 26:36.291
Do you like it? All the way up.

26:36.791 --> 26:39.125
…the joy of being in the Lord's home.

26:39.208 --> 26:41.166
Here, brethren…

26:41.250 --> 26:45.291
WHERE IS THE CHURCH
I WANT TO VISIT

26:45.375 --> 26:49.541
So if you left your home
a bit discouraged,

26:49.625 --> 26:53.583
if you woke up feeling down,
a bit lethargic,

26:53.666 --> 26:56.583
angry, nagging,

26:56.666 --> 27:00.000
tonight, you will cheer up!

27:00.083 --> 27:01.708
Amen.

27:01.791 --> 27:03.666
In this house, in God's house…

27:03.750 --> 27:05.958
PULGA'S GOT THE RAT IN SIGHT

27:06.041 --> 27:09.291
…you will always be protected.

27:09.375 --> 27:10.708
Glory be to God!

27:11.416 --> 27:14.208
Those who already attended our church…

27:18.041 --> 27:20.833
Those exercises really help.

27:20.916 --> 27:24.666
Yeah, the singing lessons
make a huge difference.

27:24.750 --> 27:26.625
Guys, it's time. Let's go?

27:26.708 --> 27:28.166
-Sure.
-Let's go.

27:28.666 --> 27:33.333
I'd like to invite brother Donizete,
so we can together…

27:33.416 --> 27:36.333
Hey. What happened here?

27:41.333 --> 27:45.083
Lord have mercy.
Something happened with the microphone.

27:45.166 --> 27:46.833
But it's okay.

27:46.916 --> 27:50.333
Because first I wanted to tell you

27:50.833 --> 27:54.541
that I asked God to guide me

27:54.625 --> 27:58.125
on how to carry out today's service.

27:58.208 --> 28:00.208
-There's no other way?
-It's fried.

28:00.708 --> 28:03.333
Without power,
we can't use any instruments.

28:03.416 --> 28:05.208
Where can we find another one?

28:06.125 --> 28:09.041
I have a friend nearby,
but it won't be for free.

28:12.541 --> 28:13.958
The clock is ticking.

28:14.458 --> 28:15.500
How much?

28:16.083 --> 28:19.458
We march on
Your army

28:19.541 --> 28:21.291
Is powerful

28:21.375 --> 28:23.583
Your glory will be seen…

28:23.666 --> 28:27.750
HE'S CLOSE. WAIT FOR ME OUTSIDE

28:28.250 --> 28:29.875
-Let us sing
-What?

28:29.958 --> 28:32.541
-The victory chant
-Glory be to God!

28:32.625 --> 28:34.916
-We have to go.
-Wait, Nando.

28:35.000 --> 28:36.333
Let's go, Scheyla.

28:36.958 --> 28:38.708
We have to go get Bruninha.

28:41.041 --> 28:42.375
Why?

28:42.458 --> 28:45.416
Jesus Christ is our general

28:45.500 --> 28:48.916
We follow in his footsteps

28:49.000 --> 28:54.375
No enemy shall resist us

28:54.458 --> 28:56.208
One more time!

28:56.291 --> 28:58.916
Jesus Christ is our general…

29:07.708 --> 29:11.000
-Rita, what's going on?
-The equipment is busted.

29:11.083 --> 29:13.791
Something to do with power.
They can't perform.

29:13.875 --> 29:16.333
-I'm going to fix it.
-Lord have mercy.

29:16.416 --> 29:19.458
Shouldn't we send someone
who knows this stuff?

29:19.541 --> 29:21.500
If I don't do it, no one will.

29:22.000 --> 29:22.958
Be right back.

29:24.291 --> 29:25.791
-Let's go, Marcão?
-Yep.

29:29.500 --> 29:31.916
Do what you gotta do, but come back.

29:33.375 --> 29:34.916
For me and for our kids.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.041
Look at me.

29:38.875 --> 29:41.125
Don't forget what you promised us.

29:47.416 --> 29:48.666
Bye, sweetheart.

29:50.083 --> 29:51.291
Daddy loves you.

29:55.416 --> 29:58.625
BROTHER, WE'RE HERE,
BUT IT'S GONNA TAKE A WHILE

30:08.833 --> 30:11.708
Sup, fucker? Step on it, man. Step on it!

30:17.583 --> 30:19.916
"Every gun pointed at us shall perish."

30:21.500 --> 30:22.333
Amen.

30:24.250 --> 30:27.875
Bro, it's time to fuck that rat up.

30:34.916 --> 30:41.000
LOOK, I FOUND YOUR GIRL HERE

30:42.458 --> 30:44.958
Doni, since we're out of juice,

30:45.041 --> 30:46.833
how about we go unplugged?

30:47.333 --> 30:50.250
I'm down. Let's see what Ton thinks.

30:52.041 --> 30:53.416
Hallelujah!

30:59.916 --> 31:01.541
Pulga, are you on his tail?

31:01.625 --> 31:03.333
I'm on his ass, brother.

31:13.166 --> 31:14.375
Let's do it?

31:18.250 --> 31:23.625
If they tried to kill your dreams

31:23.708 --> 31:27.333
By suffocating your heart

31:27.416 --> 31:28.416
Sing, brethren!

31:28.500 --> 31:32.333
If they threw you in a grave

31:32.416 --> 31:34.833
I'm behind them. Here's the location.

31:34.916 --> 31:35.916
We got him.

31:36.000 --> 31:37.541
Let's jump him.

31:38.875 --> 31:40.000
Hit the gas.

31:40.083 --> 31:43.333
Kill your dreams

31:43.416 --> 31:48.041
By suffocating your heart

31:48.625 --> 31:53.125
If they threw you in a grave

31:53.208 --> 31:58.208
And hurt, you lost your sight

31:58.291 --> 32:02.625
Don't give up
Don't stop believing

32:02.708 --> 32:07.583
God's dreams will never wither

32:08.625 --> 32:12.708
Don't give up
Don't stop fighting

32:12.791 --> 32:15.500
Don't stop praising

32:16.000 --> 32:19.958
Look up and see

32:20.541 --> 32:26.541
That God is restoring your dreams

32:27.208 --> 32:31.875
And your sight

32:34.458 --> 32:39.125
Receive the cure

32:39.208 --> 32:43.833
Receive the anointing

32:43.916 --> 32:46.208
Anointing of boldness

32:46.291 --> 32:48.791
Anointing of victory

32:48.875 --> 32:53.375
Anointing of multiplication

32:55.625 --> 32:56.791
Yeah…

32:56.875 --> 32:59.875
When the kids only cared about
getting new shoes,

32:59.958 --> 33:01.791
I was already in the business.

33:02.625 --> 33:05.583
When I was 12, I got me a shiny piece.

33:06.166 --> 33:08.000
Hard chrome finish.

33:08.750 --> 33:11.041
I was the talk of the hood.

33:11.125 --> 33:13.916
What about you, Nando?
What did you want to be?

33:18.958 --> 33:20.500
I wanted to be a businessman.

33:22.291 --> 33:23.500
And a singer.

33:23.583 --> 33:25.000
Anointing of boldness

33:25.083 --> 33:27.583
Anointing of victory

33:27.666 --> 33:32.291
Anointing of multiplication

33:32.375 --> 33:34.791
Anointing of boldness

33:34.875 --> 33:36.916
Anointing of victory

33:37.500 --> 33:41.416
Anointing of multiplication

33:42.375 --> 33:44.625
Anointing of boldness

33:55.333 --> 33:56.541
Bad news, brother.

33:56.625 --> 33:59.416
I have him,
but he's with that fucking cop.

34:01.458 --> 34:02.791
He's with the cop.

34:03.666 --> 34:04.875
Call Messinho.

34:11.083 --> 34:14.250
God, protect me along my path.

34:15.083 --> 34:16.750
I put my life in your hands.

34:17.708 --> 34:18.916
Amen.

34:19.000 --> 34:20.541
-Glory to God!
-Hallelujah!

34:21.541 --> 34:23.083
Thank you, brethren!

34:28.500 --> 34:29.416
There they are.

34:31.083 --> 34:32.375
Hurry up, Formiga!

34:32.458 --> 34:34.333
-I'm trying, bro.
-Step on it.

34:34.416 --> 34:37.333
You can get out, Pulga.
We're right behind them.

34:39.416 --> 34:40.625
It's time, man.

34:40.708 --> 34:42.541
Come on, bro! Don't lose them!

34:44.250 --> 34:45.416
I got him.

34:46.500 --> 34:48.541
Caneta, keep calling Messinho.

34:48.625 --> 34:50.333
I'm trying. Don't worry.

34:50.416 --> 34:53.458
Stop, man. They're pulling over.

34:53.541 --> 34:54.875
Pull over, Formiga!

34:54.958 --> 34:58.291
Messinho, the cop's with him.
Do we off them both?

35:01.875 --> 35:04.083
Messinho just gave us the go-ahead.

35:04.166 --> 35:06.958
Let's fry this fucker. Split him in half.

35:07.041 --> 35:08.041
Let's do it.

35:08.541 --> 35:10.375
You know the law of the hood.

35:10.958 --> 35:14.083
-You either roll with us…
-Or get rolled over.

35:14.625 --> 35:15.458
Let's go.

35:20.000 --> 35:21.000
Let's get him.

35:41.166 --> 35:42.583
Let's double-check.

35:48.000 --> 35:49.166
Light them up.

39:42.125 --> 39:46.041
