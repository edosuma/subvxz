[man]<i> Axl?</i>

07:06.926 --> 07:09.093

<i> -</i> [man]<i> No.</i>
-Seriously, and we're just
finding out about this now?

07:19.173 --> 07:22.874
The concert is this
fucking weekend and
I'm fucking pissed

07:22.876 --> 07:25.777
because I am not fucking
driving four fucking hours

07:25.779 --> 07:28.213
not to fucking see him
do the fucking snake dance.

07:28.215 --> 07:31.049
That's fucking bullshit!

[man]<i> Are you okay? Why</i>

<i>Even guys like that have those.</i>

07:33.887 --> 07:35.887
No, no.

07:35.889 --> 07:38.490
No. I've just been
bed garbage all day.

07:38.492 --> 07:39.858
[man]<i> All day?</i>

07:39.860 --> 07:42.727

07:43.030 --> 07:44.663
[man]<i> Yelling at the moment.</i>

07:44.665 --> 07:52.170
No, it's just I'm driving
alone to a Guns N' Roses
concert, like a loser,

07:52.172 --> 07:55.640
and I couldn't even give
away free tickets on the
internet to strangers.

No, I'm definitely
going to die alone

08:02.015 --> 08:04.249

and no one is going
to come get my body.

[man]<i> Girl, that's</i>
<i> not gonna happen.</i>

08:06.753 --> 08:09.254
No, no, I've worked in nursing
homes and that totally happens.

08:09.256 --> 08:13.124
No one visits you, and then no
one comes and picks up the body.

08:13.126 --> 08:15.093
And then you're
buried by strangers.

08:16.163 --> 08:17.996
[man]<i> Boo, get it together.</i>

08:18.632 --> 08:21.199
I'm just going to give up and
become a burden on the state.

You can live in hospitals
for free if you want to,
you can just show up,

08:25.506 --> 08:29.007
be a lazy piece of shit,
people are obligated
to take care of you.

13:22.302 --> 13:24.402
No, it's just-- you know,
you can travel

13:24.404 --> 13:28.406
and I thought there's
nothing happening in L.A.
except for my gays.

13:29.176 --> 13:33.011
And I figured, you
know, I could just
spend like a year

13:33.013 --> 13:35.880
like just kicking it around,
like, West Coast.

13:35.882 --> 13:40.018

-I like--

26:36.149 --> 26:38.661
Did you ever think about getting
an Aphrodite-type hairdo where
you look like a goddess?

26:38.664 --> 26:40.748
No, Pete, I haven't
thought about that.

26:40.749 --> 26:42.833
Why don't you drink some of
this water? Drink this water.

26:42.835 --> 26:44.335
Okay, does it have vodka in it?

26:44.337 --> 26:46.670
No, absolutely not.

26:46.672 --> 26:50.975
Oh, honey! Who put water-
who put water in there?

26:50.977 --> 26:52.209
Me, I put water in that.

27:06.258 --> 27:08.025
[coughing]

27:08.861 --> 27:09.994
[farting]

27:18.170 --> 27:19.336
Ugh.

28:39.819 --> 28:41.752
[crowd cheering]

29:10.282 --> 29:12.149
Wow, she's a lady.

29:12.151 --> 29:13.784
Yeah.

29:13.786 --> 29:16.053
Nice shirt!

29:17.056 --> 29:18.021
What are you drinking?

29:18.023 --> 29:19.022
Still beer.

29:19.024 --> 29:20.541
Ah, yeah, me, too.

29:20.542 --> 29:22.059
-Uh, if you need one take one.
-Oh, it's okay.

29:22.061 --> 29:23.460
No really, I'm here by myself.

29:23.462 --> 29:24.862
I don't need to
drink all of this.

29:24.864 --> 29:27.498
Shut up! I'm here by myself!

29:27.500 --> 29:31.001
I was just telling my friends
that I would be the only
loser here alone but...

29:32.471 --> 29:33.370
So where do you live?

29:33.372 --> 29:34.438
Santa Clarita.

29:35.074 --> 29:36.373
I live in L.A.!

29:36.375 --> 29:38.075
-Crazy!
-Yeah, that's super close.

29:38.077 --> 29:44.782
You know I wanna say, uh,
I'm not a loser, I just couldn't
find anyone to come with me.

29:45.117 --> 29:48.185
Seriously? Did I hurt
your feelings?

29:48.187 --> 29:49.119
No.

29:51.557 --> 29:53.257
You couldn't get your
wife to come with you?

29:53.259 --> 29:54.491
I don't have a wife.

29:55.060 --> 29:56.927
You-- you look like
you would have a wife.

29:56.929 --> 29:57.995
Nope.

29:59.999 --> 30:01.331
I did.

30:01.901 --> 30:03.801
Did she divorce you
for wearing that shirt?

30:03.803 --> 30:05.803
You are being sarcastic.

30:06.272 --> 30:07.938
You're about to feel really bad.

30:08.808 --> 30:09.540
She's dead.

30:09.542 --> 30:11.241
Oh, fuck, I'm sorry.

30:11.243 --> 30:12.876
Eh, it's alright.

30:12.878 --> 30:15.345
It happened like two and
a half years ago, it's fine.

30:21.487 --> 30:23.353
So, you like Guns N' Roses.

30:23.355 --> 30:26.356
Yeah, fuck, yeah.
I mean I grew up with them.

30:26.358 --> 30:29.393
I fucking love them.
Axl is a God.

30:30.095 --> 30:33.597
I'm not a gay but he is the
sexiest lead singer out of
any of those fucking bands.

30:33.599 --> 30:36.083
No, totally.

30:36.084 --> 30:38.568
I've been in love with him
since I saw him on MTV
when I was like nine.

30:38.571 --> 30:40.537
He's legit the first man
I ever masturbated to.

30:40.539 --> 30:41.939
Sexy guy.

30:41.941 --> 30:43.240
Did you do the same thing?

30:43.242 --> 30:44.341
No, I did not.

30:44.343 --> 30:45.843
So you're- you're not gay.

30:45.845 --> 30:47.277
No, I just told you
I had a wife.

30:47.279 --> 30:50.914
A lot of gay guys have wives.

30:50.915 --> 30:54.550
And also, we just bonded over
how sexy Axl is, and if someone
says aloud that they're not gay

30:54.553 --> 30:55.986
it's usually because
they're gay.

30:55.988 --> 31:01.058
It's just all my friends are
gay and I just instantly
lose attraction for someone

31:01.060 --> 31:03.894
if I get the slightest inkling
that they're even a little
bit into dudes.

31:03.896 --> 31:06.263
Well, I'm not. I don't
have a problem with it.

31:06.265 --> 31:08.298
So you've never had
a guy, like, suck your
dick or anything.

31:12.404 --> 31:13.387
Not even once.

31:13.388 --> 31:14.371
-I'm sorry- I'm
sorry- I'm sorry!
-[Dustin laughing]

31:14.373 --> 31:18.108
I have trust issues! I've-- It's
just-- then it's something that

31:18.110 --> 31:21.078
you can just never satisfy
in another person
and it's just, like,

31:21.080 --> 31:24.147
I'm never gonna have
a dick, I'm so sorry.

31:30.956 --> 31:33.390
-So what do-- what do you do?
-Oh, I hate that question.

31:33.392 --> 31:35.492
Sorry.

31:35.493 --> 31:37.593
No it's fine, I just-- I hate
people's reaction to my answer.

31:38.197 --> 31:42.900
-What, do you work for
the IRS or something?
-No- uh, I'm a funeral director.

31:42.902 --> 31:44.234
-Oh shit, fuck!
-See!

31:45.404 --> 31:48.455
I mean I'm a travel nurse.

31:48.456 --> 31:51.507
So I spend most of my days
like up to my balls in blood,
and shit and bedpans.

31:51.510 --> 31:54.077
Well, we have that in common
except for the bedpans.

31:54.079 --> 31:56.146
Yeah, the shit just runs
right down the drain.

31:56.148 --> 31:57.898
Yeah we put everything
down there.

31:57.899 --> 31:59.649
It's really no different
than what someone
would flush down a toilet.

31:59.652 --> 32:02.503
-Oh, sick.
-[chuckles]

32:02.504 --> 32:05.355
I'm probably gonna wander into
the desert one day never to be
seen or heard from again.

32:05.357 --> 32:07.691
What do you mean the desert?

32:07.692 --> 32:10.026
Well, I'd rather be, like,
pecked by vultures or something

32:10.029 --> 32:12.529
rather than die in some
nightmare nursing home.

32:12.531 --> 32:14.498
I've- I've pretty much accepted

32:14.499 --> 32:16.466
that I'm just gonna
live the rest of my life
a lonely old lady.

32:16.468 --> 32:19.169
Like a old cat woman?

32:19.171 --> 32:22.039
No, not a cat lady because
I fucking hate animals.

32:22.041 --> 32:26.476
All they do is they piss
and shit in your house,
and they wanna be on you,

32:26.478 --> 32:30.180
and they cost you
money, it's just, no, I'm
gonna be like an old hag.

32:30.182 --> 32:32.566
Like a fag hag.

32:32.567 --> 32:34.951
Like, literally, all my friends
are giant 'mos, I'm telling you!

32:34.954 --> 32:38.588
Why do you think you're going
to spend the rest of your life
alone? You're a woman.

32:38.590 --> 32:41.525
You could just find some
random guy to be with
if you really wanted to.

32:41.527 --> 32:45.963
What do you think I spend
all of my time doing?
I can't find anybody.

32:45.965 --> 32:48.231
I guarantee you there are guys
out there that would be with you

32:48.233 --> 32:51.034
based off of just the fact
that you are any woman.

32:51.036 --> 32:53.704
Well, if there are,
I can't find them.

32:54.206 --> 32:56.707
I'm constantly being
rejected by women.

32:56.709 --> 33:00.677
Yeah, probably because you're
always going after the super
hot ones, like all men.

33:01.680 --> 33:05.415
I'll never understand why
these hideous man-beasts
are chasing after model-types,

33:05.417 --> 33:06.450
like that's delusional.

33:06.452 --> 33:09.052
I don't go after
women like that.

33:09.054 --> 33:10.654
I go for women like you.

33:14.093 --> 33:15.325
A woman like me.

33:15.694 --> 33:17.094
Meaning what?

33:17.096 --> 33:21.231
Okay, let's not pretend
like you didn't just call me
a hideous man-beast.

33:21.233 --> 33:22.499
I was not talking about you!

33:22.501 --> 33:24.601
Well, I wasn't
talking about you!

33:26.138 --> 33:28.438
You said women like
me like not models.

33:28.440 --> 33:30.974
Neither one of us
is a model, all right?

33:30.975 --> 33:33.509
So, let's not pretend like
either of us has anything
over on the other one.

33:33.512 --> 33:35.479
Marilyn Monroe was a size 16!

33:35.481 --> 33:36.546
[chuckling] Okay...

33:38.584 --> 33:39.716
Fuck off.

33:45.524 --> 33:47.491
Oh, my god.

33:49.762 --> 33:52.362
Oh! You're such a pussy!

34:05.477 --> 34:07.244
[laughing]

35:12.111 --> 35:14.711
Text Dustin, "Are
you in your room?"

35:18.150 --> 35:19.416
[sending text]

35:40.639 --> 35:42.472
[phone ringing]

35:47.880 --> 35:49.579
<i> Hey, it's Dustin.</i>

35:49.581 --> 35:50.714
<i> Leave a message.</i>

35:56.622 --> 35:58.321
[phone ringing]

36:08.300 --> 36:10.800
<i> -Hey, it's Dustin.</i>
<i> Leave a message.</i>
-What the fuck?

36:27.819 --> 36:30.420
Shit, shit.

36:52.711 --> 36:54.377
[phone ringing]

36:55.480 --> 36:56.713
<i> Hey, it's Dustin.</i>

36:56.715 --> 36:57.781
<i> Leave a message.</i>

36:59.918 --> 37:04.821
Hey, um, so, um, I'm calling
just 'cause I'm here.

37:04.823 --> 37:13.763
Um, yeah, I- I was gonna drop
this stuff off so, hopefully,
you will feel better um,

37:14.766 --> 37:18.468
so, yeah, I just- I- I figured
I would drop them by, um,

37:18.470 --> 37:20.737
I'm not going
to stay or anything.

37:21.240 --> 37:26.710
Uh, so, um, I'm gonna
hang out around my room
so just give me a call

37:26.712 --> 37:30.647
and I can drop this stuff by
and if you're feeling better

37:30.649 --> 37:37.554
you know maybe we can hang,
or not, whatever is cool
with me--either is fine.

37:37.956 --> 37:40.523
Okay--talk soon!

37:42.561 --> 37:45.962
Whoa! Okay, I don't
know what that was.

37:45.964 --> 37:50.667
Okay, um, okay b--
uh, okay-- okay, bye.

37:59.344 --> 38:00.443
Fuck!

38:29.608 --> 38:30.874
[switching channels]

38:35.314 --> 38:36.313
[turning off TV]

38:52.097 --> 38:53.530
[text alert]

39:00.105 --> 39:03.573
Fucking text threads!
I don't care!

39:05.677 --> 39:08.044
[text alerts]

39:28.900 --> 39:30.567
Oh, wow!

39:31.636 --> 39:34.120
Is this a suite?

39:34.121 --> 39:36.605
Yeah, I'm treating myself,
no kids, no corpses.

39:37.542 --> 39:38.742
You have kids?

39:38.744 --> 39:39.943
Yeah, three.

39:39.945 --> 39:43.813
Kaylee is 8, Davis
is 11 and Jay is 16.

39:43.815 --> 39:45.615
That explains the shirt, Dad.

39:45.617 --> 39:46.816
Would you stop it
with the shirt?

39:46.818 --> 39:48.885
It's really bad.
I'm trying to help you.

39:48.887 --> 39:50.053
You want me to take it off?

39:51.490 --> 39:51.988
There.

39:51.990 --> 39:53.356
Oh.

39:53.357 --> 39:54.723
Now you don't have
to see it anymore.

39:57.796 --> 39:58.862
-Just...
-Help!

39:58.864 --> 40:00.663
Okay--Jesus. Slow down.

40:00.665 --> 40:03.833
-Shut up and show
me your thick rod!
-[Dustin chuckles]

40:36.902 --> 40:38.568
Oh.

40:39.838 --> 40:41.905
I have no blood.

40:43.742 --> 40:45.141
I need water.

41:22.681 --> 41:24.214
Oh, are we not doing that?

41:24.816 --> 41:26.216
[Dustin] Uh, what?

41:26.918 --> 41:28.685
[Jodie] Cuddling.
You don't want to spoon?

41:28.687 --> 41:31.654
[Dustin] Oh-- oh,
God, I feel like shit.

41:32.858 --> 41:34.824
Oh, god, my stomach.

41:35.827 --> 41:37.060
Are you okay?

41:37.996 --> 41:40.313
[vomiting]

41:40.314 --> 41:42.631
Oh, my, God! Here, let
me-- let me help you!

41:42.634 --> 41:44.200
No, I'm okay!

41:44.202 --> 41:46.736
No, seriously,
I'm an actual nurse.
Are you clammy?

41:46.738 --> 41:48.571
No seriously, I'm fine.

41:48.573 --> 41:50.507
Do you normally
get this hung over?

41:51.243 --> 41:53.110
No.

41:53.111 --> 41:54.978
Well, then maybe you
have a bug- or you're
probably dehydrated.

41:54.980 --> 41:57.080
I'm gonna be okay,
you should just go.

41:57.082 --> 41:58.114
I just need to feel sick.

41:58.116 --> 41:59.716
Okay, well let me just look--

41:59.718 --> 42:02.051
Oh, God-- really--
seriously-- no thanks.

42:02.053 --> 42:04.888
Sorry. Okay, well,
I could get you some
Pepto, or a sports drink,

42:04.890 --> 42:06.022
some electrolytes?

42:06.024 --> 42:07.924
Seriously, just go.

42:07.926 --> 42:10.760
I could drive you back
to L.A. if you don't feel
like you can--

42:10.762 --> 42:11.895
I flew.

42:11.897 --> 42:13.541
Ok.

42:13.542 --> 42:15.186
Well, I'm gonna go get
some supplies and
then I'll be right back.

42:15.187 --> 42:16.831
Honestly, I just need
to be by myself.

42:16.835 --> 42:18.902
No, I'm gonna be right back.

42:43.828 --> 42:45.962
[beeping]

42:58.910 --> 43:00.243
[phone ringing]

43:04.683 --> 43:05.982
Hey, Sis, what's up?

43:05.984 --> 43:08.084
[Christy speaking]

43:08.086 --> 43:08.985
Yeah.

43:08.987 --> 43:13.156
No it's in the mail and
there's a card in there
for mom too so sign it.

43:15.694 --> 43:19.662
I'm good! I went to Guns
N' Roses last night.

43:19.664 --> 43:20.597
[Christy]<i> Oh, how was it?</i>

43:20.599 --> 43:21.764
Amazing.

43:21.766 --> 43:22.999
[Christy]<i> Aw.</i>

43:23.001 --> 43:25.201
Axl was so, so good.

43:25.203 --> 43:26.869
[Christy speaking]

43:26.871 --> 43:27.971
Yeah.

43:27.973 --> 43:29.205
[Christy speaking]

43:29.207 --> 43:30.006
Yeah.

43:30.008 --> 43:31.908
No it-- it was awesome.

43:31.910 --> 43:33.810
[Christy]<i> Oh, good, good.</i>

43:33.812 --> 43:36.179
So, guess what?

43:36.181 --> 43:37.347
[Christy]<i> What?</i>

43:37.849 --> 43:39.716
I met a boy.

43:39.718 --> 43:40.750
[Christy]<i> You met a boy?</i>

43:40.752 --> 43:42.118
Yeah, at the concert.

43:42.120 --> 43:44.253
[Christy]<i> Oh, Lord.</i>
<i> I don't know about it.</i>

43:44.255 --> 43:45.505
Oh, shut up!

43:45.506 --> 43:46.756
[Christy]<i> You met him</i>
<i> at the concert?</i>

43:46.758 --> 43:48.425
Well, so what?

43:48.426 --> 43:50.093
[Christy]<i> I hope he's</i>
<i> not wild and crazy.</i>

43:50.095 --> 43:54.030
No! No, he is nice!
He's a funeral director.

43:54.032 --> 43:55.765
[Christy laughing]

43:56.301 --> 43:57.667
Christy?

43:58.236 --> 43:59.802
Christy-- why is that funny?

43:59.804 --> 44:01.804
[Christy]<i> Oh, my God.</i>
<i> That is ridiculous.</i>

44:01.806 --> 44:03.139
-No!
-[Christy]<i> Does he have a wife?</i>

44:03.141 --> 44:04.874
No! He doesn't have a wife.

44:04.876 --> 44:08.077
And you're about to feel
really bad because she's dead.

44:08.079 --> 44:09.746
-[Christy]<i> Oh.</i>
-Yeah, a lot of people

44:09.748 --> 44:12.115
don't find true love
until their second
marriages anyway.

44:13.385 --> 44:17.120
[Christy]<i> Did you</i>
<i> say that to him?</i>

44:17.121 --> 44:20.856
No, I did not say that to him,
I just met him last night.

44:20.859 --> 44:23.660
[Christy]<i> Well, don't</i>
<i> come out so drunk.</i>
<i> You're doing that thing.</i>

44:23.662 --> 44:25.862
-I am not!
-[Christy]<i> Jodie, come on.</i>

44:25.864 --> 44:27.830
<i> -You know how you get.</i>
-I am not!

44:27.832 --> 44:30.133
[Christy]<i> You're</i>
<i> getting intense.</i>

44:30.134 --> 44:32.435
You know I guess I thought
you'd be fucking excited for me

44:32.437 --> 44:36.305
because you're always
crawling up my fucking ass
about meeting someone.

44:36.307 --> 44:39.842
But I guess that's too much
to ask from my bitch sister.

44:39.844 --> 44:41.344
[Christy]<i> Oh, fuck you, Jodie.</i>

44:41.346 --> 44:43.346
No, fuck you!

44:43.347 --> 44:45.347
-Fuck you! You-- go
fold the fucking shirt!
-<i> You need to...</i>

44:46.885 --> 44:48.051
Fucking cunt.

45:25.323 --> 45:27.323
Hey, Dustin! Hey.

45:28.259 --> 45:31.227
I know you're in there!
Seriously, what the fuck?

45:31.763 --> 45:35.364
I brought you this stuff,
I just-- I want you to
feel better. I'm not crazy.

45:35.366 --> 45:36.899
Seriously, fuck!

45:37.936 --> 45:40.269
-Hey!
-Hey, I'm sorry,
uh, I have to go.

45:40.271 --> 45:41.871
Do you want me to drive
you to the airport?

45:41.873 --> 45:42.805
No, I have my car.

45:42.807 --> 45:44.373
Um, sorry-- family emergency.

45:44.375 --> 45:46.409
-You said you flew.
-Oh, weird.

45:46.411 --> 45:48.211
Well, do you want your bandana?

45:48.213 --> 45:50.480
You know what? You keep it.

45:50.481 --> 45:52.748
Keep it? What about
this stuff? Do you--
do you feel better?

45:52.751 --> 45:55.084
Uh, no, I'm good.
I hope everything
works out for you.

45:55.086 --> 45:58.154
You hope everything works
out for me? What the fuck
is that supposed to mean?

45:58.156 --> 46:00.190
Look, I don't know,
I'm just saying things.

46:00.191 --> 46:02.225
Alright? I-- I feel like shit,
my son broke his arm,

46:02.227 --> 46:04.393
I don't want your stuff,
I really have to go.

46:04.395 --> 46:06.929
Okay, well, why didn't you
just text me that? Like,
you could've just said,

46:06.931 --> 46:08.865
"Jodie, hey, great
time last night.

46:08.867 --> 46:10.833
My kid broke his arm.
Call me sometime."

46:10.835 --> 46:12.869
-That's not that hard!
-Cause I don't want
to do that, alright?

46:12.871 --> 46:14.170
I-- I don't want to get
into anything with you.

46:14.172 --> 46:16.339
Not right now, not for
the foreseeable future.

46:16.341 --> 46:20.209
Well, why didn't you just tell
me that instead of making up
some lie about your kid?

46:20.211 --> 46:21.544
-It's not a lie.
-Okay.

46:21.546 --> 46:24.046
It's not! Here... Fuck.

46:24.048 --> 46:25.782
There, my son broke
his arm, okay?

46:25.784 --> 46:27.416
-Okay, well, I believed you.
-Okay!

46:28.052 --> 46:29.218
Bye, Jode.

46:29.220 --> 46:32.555
You do not get to call me Jode.

46:32.557 --> 46:34.090
Bye, Ghost.

46:34.092 --> 46:37.360
Bye, Ghost! I didn't even
like you that much.

46:37.362 --> 46:40.196
I hope your son feels better
but not for you, for him!

46:40.198 --> 46:42.431
I hope that he feels better
and you feel bad.

46:42.433 --> 46:43.966
You fucking ghost!

46:43.968 --> 46:45.868
I'm, literally alive
and right here.

46:45.870 --> 46:48.404
You fucking banshee! Be gone!

46:48.406 --> 46:49.839
[Dustin] Jesus Christ.

46:52.577 --> 46:53.876
Ugh!

46:57.882 --> 46:59.282
[grunting]

47:09.561 --> 47:12.094
[breathing heavily]

49:06.244 --> 49:07.576
Oh, fuck!

49:50.621 --> 49:52.621
¶¶¶

50:41.305 --> 50:42.304
[turns off car]

51:41.699 --> 51:43.499
[screams]

52:15.299 --> 52:16.198
Do you smoke?

52:16.701 --> 52:18.400
Sometimes, sure, I'm down.

52:18.402 --> 52:19.268
Cool.

52:19.570 --> 52:21.437
Hey, can I borrow that?

52:22.440 --> 52:25.341
Yes, but that is a very
special bandana.

52:25.343 --> 52:25.908
Why?

52:25.910 --> 52:30.846
I bought that for my first
Guns N' Roses concert when
I was thirteen in Chicago.

52:31.449 --> 52:34.150
My dad drove me down from--
We lived in Milwaukee-

52:34.152 --> 52:36.519
and he drove me all the way
down just to take me.

52:36.521 --> 52:39.655
He didn't even go, he just
dropped my off and hung
out at a Denny's.

52:39.657 --> 52:40.789
Sweet.

52:41.325 --> 52:42.691
Do you like being a dad?

52:42.693 --> 52:45.895
Of course. It's like the most
fulfilling thing in my life.

52:45.897 --> 52:47.363
I want to be a mom.

52:47.365 --> 52:51.267
Don't worry. I didn't poke holes
in the condom or anything.

52:51.269 --> 52:53.602
I did tie it off and put it in
the mini-fridge though.

52:53.604 --> 52:56.405
-What?
-I'm kidding! I'm not crazy.

52:57.341 --> 53:00.409
Sometimes I do worry
my uterus is just going to rot

53:00.411 --> 53:02.244
out before I find someone
to have kids with.

53:03.447 --> 53:06.815
Having kids either
makes you more selfish
or completely selfless.

53:06.817 --> 53:07.917
Which one are you?

53:07.919 --> 53:11.520
Uh, fuck, I guess that's
not entirely accurate.

53:11.522 --> 53:13.455
I guess sometimes
you feel both.

53:13.457 --> 53:16.692
You know sometimes
you lie so you can smoke
a joint and jerk off

53:16.694 --> 53:19.395
instead of going to your
daughter's softball game,

53:19.397 --> 53:21.530
other times you take
a bullet for them.

53:23.267 --> 53:24.700
Maybe it's a sliding scale.

53:25.870 --> 53:27.803
I think I'd be more selfless.

53:29.207 --> 53:31.707
I feel less anxious when
I'm thinking about things
that aren't myself.

53:31.709 --> 53:33.776
What's that called?
Externa-- externalizing.

53:35.413 --> 53:37.379
What about your wife?
What was she?

53:40.751 --> 53:42.851
Oh, bad question.

53:42.853 --> 53:44.820
It's fine, we don't
have to talk about.

53:44.822 --> 53:45.754
No, it's fine.

53:45.756 --> 53:48.958
Um, yeah, she was more selfish.

53:48.960 --> 53:50.726
You know, she'd like disappear.

53:50.728 --> 53:53.495
Drinking and sleeping basically.

53:53.497 --> 53:55.664
-Was she an alcoholic?
-Yeah, big time.

53:55.666 --> 53:57.733
-I'm sorry.
-Eh, was what it was.

53:57.735 --> 53:59.368
Nothing to do about it now.

54:03.608 --> 54:05.708
Do you mind if I ask
how she happened?

54:05.710 --> 54:08.244
How she happened?
Like how she died?

54:08.246 --> 54:09.778
Oh, yeah.
Sorry, I'm stoned.

54:09.780 --> 54:12.381
Uh, yeah, she killed herself.

54:12.383 --> 54:13.616
Fuck.

54:13.618 --> 54:15.651
But I don't think
she actually meant to.

54:18.656 --> 54:22.074
Excuse me?

54:22.075 --> 54:25.493
-You want the story, huh?
-I mean, no, we don't have to
talk about it, but, yeah, kinda.

54:25.496 --> 54:26.695
Alright.

54:26.697 --> 54:32.334
Uh, so I came home from work,
I was working on this girl who
had been in an accident and-

54:32.336 --> 54:33.535
uh, it was bad.

54:33.537 --> 54:34.470
How bad?

54:34.472 --> 54:37.540
Like, really bad.

54:37.541 --> 54:40.609
Jay was thirteen at the time,
I come in, "Where's mom?"
"Oh, she's taking a bath."

54:41.345 --> 54:44.480
Go up to check on her,
figuring I'm gonna
find her plastered

54:44.482 --> 54:46.715
and then an argument
is gonna ensue.

54:47.318 --> 54:51.553
I go in, she's laying in
the bath, candles
all over the bathroom.

54:52.890 --> 54:55.391
She drank six bottles of wine.

54:56.927 --> 55:01.330
She passed out, slipped
under the water. It was red.

55:01.632 --> 55:03.632
I thought she had
slit her wrists.

55:03.634 --> 55:07.936
It was wine, one of those giant
glasses, you know, that
fits the whole bottle?

55:10.708 --> 55:14.810
Candles were so close to the
curtains, anything could have
just caught them on fire,

55:14.812 --> 55:16.545
set the whole house on fire.

55:16.547 --> 55:18.347
She could've killed the kids.

55:18.683 --> 55:20.416
It's heavy.

55:20.985 --> 55:22.351
Was she depressed?

55:22.353 --> 55:24.820
Fuck, yeah, she was depressed.

55:30.561 --> 55:33.729
Have you been in a
relationship since then?

55:33.731 --> 55:36.065
No but it doesn't mean
I haven't dealt with it.

55:36.067 --> 55:37.733
No, of course.

55:39.537 --> 55:40.602
What about you?

55:40.938 --> 55:42.571
-A relationship?
-Yeah.

55:43.674 --> 55:44.840
Nursing school.

55:44.842 --> 55:49.611
But really that was more of
a setup where we slept in the
same bed and we had sex...

55:50.614 --> 55:53.165
He sounded like a frog.

55:53.166 --> 55:55.717
He was like [with funny
voice] "Jodie, you need to
pay this month's rent.

55:55.720 --> 55:58.621
Please write a check."

55:58.622 --> 56:01.523
-What frog sounds like that?
-No, I don't know, but it
was-- that was close.

56:03.627 --> 56:06.595
And now it's like the only men
who can stand me are gay.

56:06.597 --> 56:10.766
Sometimes I think I should
just transition into being
a bear but it's like,

56:10.768 --> 56:14.436
that's not now trans
works and also I'm not
attracted to gay men so.

56:14.438 --> 56:15.571
What's a bear?

56:15.873 --> 56:17.573
It's a big hairy gay man.

56:17.575 --> 56:18.841
Would I be a bear?

56:18.843 --> 56:20.542
-Absolutely.
-Huh.

56:21.879 --> 56:23.729
And I don't know why
I am so worried about it.

56:23.730 --> 56:25.580
My sisters are married and
they're fucking miserable.

56:25.583 --> 56:26.749
Why?

56:26.751 --> 56:30.219
Well, one of them
lives in Michigan.

56:30.220 --> 56:33.688
And her husband expects her to
just sit at home, and cook, and
clean, and have sex with him,

56:33.691 --> 56:35.891
even though he's
gotten really fat

56:35.892 --> 56:38.092
and he doesn't do
anything to try to look
like a decent human being.

56:38.095 --> 56:41.830
And she, like, lives for
this middle-school drama.

56:41.832 --> 56:45.401
Shoot me if that is ever
the highlight of my life.

56:46.137 --> 56:51.940
And the other one is engaged
to this man whose only
passion is hunting arrowheads,

56:51.942 --> 56:56.145
and also, he calls
watching their children
alone babysitting.

56:58.482 --> 57:00.582
It's like some men
are such man-babies.

57:00.584 --> 57:04.052
Like they're completely
incapable of taking
care of themselves,

57:04.054 --> 57:06.989
and they expect just
because they make just
a little bit of money

57:06.991 --> 57:09.758
that they should just
act like an invalid

57:09.760 --> 57:13.595
who needs to be waited on,
hand and foot, whenever
they're not at work

57:13.597 --> 57:17.166
and that none of their
decisions or opinions
are to be challenged.

57:17.168 --> 57:20.553
And it's just, like, wake up!

57:20.554 --> 57:23.939
And, honestly, I haven't met
a straight man lately who's
not a complete dick...

57:24.842 --> 57:26.708
A guy called me pig hag!

57:26.710 --> 57:29.378
Pig hag?

57:29.379 --> 57:32.047
Yeah! Because we were supposed
to go bowling together
and I slept through my alarm

57:32.049 --> 57:35.651
because I'd had three
all-night shifts in a row.

57:35.653 --> 57:38.187
But then it's like he goes
completely bonkers on me!

57:38.189 --> 57:43.091
And then, suddenly
I am the bipolar,
lonely, pig hag cunt,

57:43.093 --> 57:45.561
and I need to go hang
out with my gays.

57:45.563 --> 57:46.962
I had to block him.

57:46.964 --> 57:48.730
Jesus, that's terrible.

57:48.732 --> 57:50.032
Yeah, I'm almost out of blocks.

57:50.034 --> 57:51.500
You can run out of blocks?

57:51.502 --> 57:52.801
Yeah, it's fucked!

57:57.541 --> 57:58.841
Pig hag?

58:00.678 --> 58:02.110
-[Dustin laughing]
-Stop.

58:02.112 --> 58:05.614
-Stop!
-I'm sorry that that
happened to you!

58:05.616 --> 58:08.050
-No, it's cool.
-No! It's not, men can be awful.

58:08.919 --> 58:10.719
I'm sure I've been awful.

58:10.721 --> 58:11.854
Probably.

58:11.856 --> 58:13.789
Probably will be awful again.

58:14.758 --> 58:17.226
Well, don't be awful to me.

58:18.162 --> 58:20.496
If I'm bad you can
always block me.

58:20.498 --> 58:24.766
I'm-- I'm almost out
of blocks, that's a ter--
That's a terrible idea.

58:54.932 --> 58:56.732

1:02:40.257 --> 1:02:42.007
[man speaking]

1:02:42.008 --> 1:02:43.758
-Yeah, I'm fine. I--
<i> -</i> [man]<i> What's wrong?</i>

1:02:43.761 --> 1:02:44.960
Um-- no, I'm fine.

1:02:44.962 --> 1:02:49.197
I've just been really busy
working and hermiting.

1:02:49.199 --> 1:02:53.401
[man speaking]

1:02:53.403 --> 1:02:56.538
Yeah, you-- you--
Yeah, you can come over.

1:02:56.540 --> 1:03:00.008
-Yeah, come over.
Come over.
<i> -</i> [man]<i> Okay. Thanks.</i>

1:03:18.896 --> 1:03:20.195
Oh, look, she's alive.

1:03:20.196 --> 1:03:21.495
We seriously thought
you were dead, bitch.

1:03:21.498 --> 1:03:24.900
-I'm not.
-Honey, why does it
smell like this in here?

1:03:24.902 --> 1:03:26.101
Rotisserie chicken.

1:03:26.103 --> 1:03:27.970
Okay, Brittany Murphy.

1:03:27.971 --> 1:03:29.838
What is going on?
Did something happen
with the Guns N' Roses guy?

1:03:29.840 --> 1:03:32.073
You haven't answered
any of the threads
or a single phone call.

1:03:32.075 --> 1:03:34.176
You haven't posted about
it on Facebook either.

1:03:34.178 --> 1:03:36.278
Yeah, cut this shit.
What happened?

1:03:36.280 --> 1:03:37.379
Regale us.

1:03:37.381 --> 1:03:42.951
Okay, so, basically,
I met this guy after the
Guns N' Roses concert,

1:03:42.953 --> 1:03:46.021
and he just comes up
to me and he starts talking
to me about my outfit

1:03:46.023 --> 1:03:48.323
because we're wearing
matching bandanas or whatever.

1:03:48.325 --> 1:03:50.559
But then he ends up
being like really nice.

1:03:50.561 --> 1:03:52.360
We spend the whole
night together.

1:03:52.362 --> 1:03:53.495
He's a funeral director.

1:03:53.497 --> 1:03:55.898
That's so hot.

1:03:55.899 --> 1:03:58.300
So we meet, we hang around,
and then we end up
going back to his hotel room,

1:03:58.302 --> 1:04:01.403
where we bang,
but then he tells me
all about his dead wife.

1:04:01.405 --> 1:04:04.372
-Oh, fuck!
-Yeah, apparently, she
was like a huge alcoholic.

1:04:04.374 --> 1:04:08.443
She like, drowned
in the bathtub and she
lit the house on fire

1:04:08.445 --> 1:04:10.245
-while their kids
were inside of it.
-What?

1:04:10.247 --> 1:04:12.959
Yeah, I don't remember
all of the details

1:04:12.960 --> 1:04:15.672
because I was a little stoned
when he was explaining it.

1:04:15.673 --> 1:04:18.385
But then, I end up comforting
him, and then we bang again!
And I kissed him.

1:04:18.388 --> 1:04:19.487
You kissed him?

1:04:19.489 --> 1:04:21.923
Yeah, I ended up sleeping there.

1:04:21.925 --> 1:04:25.327
And the next morning I was
like cuddling with him, like
I'm-- like I'm spooning him,

1:04:25.329 --> 1:04:27.629
and he's like, "No, no,
don't touch me I'm sick."

1:04:27.631 --> 1:04:30.065
Well, was he actually sick?

1:04:30.067 --> 1:04:31.667
Well, I did watch him throw up.

1:04:31.668 --> 1:04:33.268
[Pete] Well maybe he
was legitimately sick, girl.

1:04:33.270 --> 1:04:36.605
Okay, well, I offered
to take care of him like
hello I'm a fucking nurse!

1:04:36.607 --> 1:04:38.440
But he was like,
"No, no, I'm good."

1:04:38.442 --> 1:04:41.142
Like he, basically, yelled
and screamed at me to go.

1:04:41.144 --> 1:04:45.513
And then, I'm like, "I can
drive you back to L.A. if
you're sick," but he ghosted.

1:04:45.515 --> 1:04:50.018
Like, I called him, and I texted
him, and I called him again,
but it went to voicemail.

1:04:50.020 --> 1:04:51.453
I didn't leave a voicemail.

1:04:51.455 --> 1:04:52.988
It's just, he never responded.

1:04:52.990 --> 1:04:55.490
-Okay.
-Well, that's the problem.

1:04:55.492 --> 1:04:57.158
[Jodie] What?
What's the problem?

1:04:57.160 --> 1:04:58.526
You cared, honey.

1:04:58.528 --> 1:05:00.712
[Jodie] I cared?

1:05:00.713 --> 1:05:02.897
Yeah, you freaked him
out, you were willing
to do too much too fast.

1:05:02.900 --> 1:05:07.002
Okay, basically, the way
relationships work now is that
whoever cares more loses

1:05:07.004 --> 1:05:08.303
and becomes unattractive
to the other party.

1:05:08.305 --> 1:05:10.105
Okay, well, that makes
zero fucking sense.

1:05:10.107 --> 1:05:12.240
Yeah, well, that's why you're
not supposed to respond

1:05:12.242 --> 1:05:13.942
to guy's texts that
you like right away.

1:05:13.944 --> 1:05:16.678
If I'm interested, why
would I wait? That's stupid.

1:05:16.680 --> 1:05:21.283
No, girl. Now I start any
conversation with a man
by saying I'm not interested,

1:05:21.285 --> 1:05:24.486
and I have never pulled in
more solid sevens in my life.

1:05:24.488 --> 1:05:26.922
Hot men. Fresh men.

1:05:26.924 --> 1:05:28.690
That's bullshit. I was
just trying to be nice.

1:05:28.692 --> 1:05:31.159
We had sex, we talked
about personal stuff.

1:05:31.161 --> 1:05:32.661
I don't want to marry
him or something.

1:05:32.663 --> 1:05:35.030
-But don't you?
-No! I barely know him.

1:05:35.032 --> 1:05:37.532
Well, did you talk to him
about being alone
for the rest of your life?

1:05:37.534 --> 1:05:39.067
I mean we got pretty deep.

1:05:39.069 --> 1:05:40.969
He was telling me
about his dead wife.

1:05:40.971 --> 1:05:42.321
That's a lot.

1:05:42.322 --> 1:05:43.672
He sensed that you
were getting too invested.

1:05:43.674 --> 1:05:45.240
Like, you were too
eager to be a thing.

1:05:45.242 --> 1:05:47.943
Well, he could've just told
me that! He ghosted.

1:05:47.945 --> 1:05:49.377
I felt like a fucking idiot.

1:05:49.379 --> 1:05:52.314
I spent all day wondering
what the fuck went wrong.

1:05:52.316 --> 1:05:55.417
And the really fucked up
thing is I really liked him.

1:05:55.419 --> 1:05:57.552
He was funny, and we got along.

1:05:57.554 --> 1:06:02.691
We had shit in common,
like, literally shit and feces
and he had a thick rod,

1:06:02.693 --> 1:06:04.459
and I didn't hate kissing him.

1:06:04.461 --> 1:06:08.596
So, yeah, maybe I did want
to see him again, so what?

1:06:08.598 --> 1:06:12.100
When people like each
other, don't they wanna
see each other again?

1:06:12.102 --> 1:06:15.337
Like, why can't
I say what I feel?

1:06:15.338 --> 1:06:18.573
Why can't I say "I like you"
without, apparently, being
some fucking crazy person?

1:06:19.609 --> 1:06:22.544
Because straight men are
fucking garbage! That's why.

1:06:22.546 --> 1:06:26.614
They can't express their
feelings, or have anyone else
express feelings at them,

1:06:26.616 --> 1:06:29.050
let alone giving
a fuck about them!

1:06:29.720 --> 1:06:35.090
You've ruined me! My gays
have ruined me! I'm ruined!

1:06:35.092 --> 1:06:38.493
-Hush your mouth.
-No, I'm too used to men
expressing their feelings

1:06:38.495 --> 1:06:42.063
and caring about my opinions
and then letting me speak!

1:06:42.065 --> 1:06:45.567
On a date, I can't get
out a sentence without
being interrupted!

1:06:45.569 --> 1:06:48.603
I mean what the fuck?

1:06:48.604 --> 1:06:51.638
Honey! You don't think
from time to time we've been
reckless with men's hearts?

1:06:52.175 --> 1:06:54.342
We treat you with respect
because you're our friend

1:06:54.344 --> 1:06:55.677
and that's what friends
do for each other.

1:06:55.679 --> 1:06:57.445
A guy called me pig hag.

1:06:57.447 --> 1:06:58.646
-Uh...
-What?

1:06:58.648 --> 1:07:02.784
Do you guys walk around
just calling people pig hag?

1:07:03.286 --> 1:07:05.253
Pig hag?

1:07:05.255 --> 1:07:06.454
No.

1:07:06.456 --> 1:07:10.375
Not unless someone wants me to.

1:07:10.376 --> 1:07:14.295
Yeah, and fat, and lonely,
and bipolar, and cunt, because
I slept through a fucking date.

1:07:14.297 --> 1:07:15.463
That's crazy.

1:07:15.465 --> 1:07:17.332
Yeah, and the really
fucked up part is

1:07:17.334 --> 1:07:21.069
is after he spends like three
days textually harassing me

1:07:21.071 --> 1:07:25.073
he sends me a message
like, "Hey, let's start
over and hang out."

1:07:25.075 --> 1:07:28.109
Like, motherfucker, I am
about to file a police report!

1:07:28.111 --> 1:07:30.145
First of all, that's terrible,
block his number immediately.

1:07:30.147 --> 1:07:31.579
I'm almost out of blocks!

1:07:32.082 --> 1:07:34.315
Okay, look at me, listen to me.

1:07:34.317 --> 1:07:38.787
This man, this Guns N' Roses
man, funeral director,
he is not the end-all be-all.

1:07:38.789 --> 1:07:40.622
Yeah, you've got
to pump the brakes.

1:07:40.624 --> 1:07:43.324
I mean this is exciting
but it's sad, too.

1:07:43.326 --> 1:07:45.593
I think you might be setting the
stakes a little bit too high up.

1:07:45.595 --> 1:07:49.264
I mean, just cause it might not
work out with this guy doesn't
mean you're gonna end alone.

1:07:49.266 --> 1:07:52.233
It's not that serious. There's
other fish in the sea, girl.

1:07:52.235 --> 1:07:57.072
It's-- I'm just-- I'm fucking
lonely! You know dating
is really fucking hard.

1:07:57.074 --> 1:08:01.509
I'm thirty-six! I'm like
five years away from
being someone's weird aunt.

1:08:01.511 --> 1:08:04.846
And I just-- I'm not
ready to be that person
at family gatherings

1:08:04.848 --> 1:08:08.450
that everybody feels sorry
for because they know I don't
have anywhere else to go.

1:08:08.452 --> 1:08:10.636
Girl, we are all lonely.

1:08:10.637 --> 1:08:12.821
Don't try to be in a
relationship just to
be in a relationship.

1:08:12.823 --> 1:08:15.190
Not a one of us has a
significant other right now.

1:08:15.192 --> 1:08:17.492
No, it's a different
for you, you're gay.

1:08:17.494 --> 1:08:22.297
And also, lies! I see you
all on your phones
with boys all the time.

1:08:22.299 --> 1:08:24.449
Not really,
it's all an illusion.

1:08:24.450 --> 1:08:26.600
Just because we're texting
men all the time and
getting loads up the ass

1:08:26.603 --> 1:08:28.269
doesn't mean
we're not lonely.

1:08:28.271 --> 1:08:30.255
Okay, well,
I would settle for that.

1:08:30.256 --> 1:08:32.240
So you guys have to help me
take sexy pics for my profile.

1:08:32.242 --> 1:08:34.459
Girl, no.

1:08:34.460 --> 1:08:36.677
Yes! Come on! I want
to do revolving dick door.

1:08:36.680 --> 1:08:38.746
It's not fair, you get to do it.

1:08:38.748 --> 1:08:42.650
I have not played ass up
door open in a long time,
for your information.

1:08:42.652 --> 1:08:45.887
And I don't really think
that this is the answer.

1:08:45.888 --> 1:08:49.123
I mean, you love to travel!
You were in Morocco and
Spain last year alone, bitch.

1:08:49.126 --> 1:08:51.343
What about the RV?

1:08:51.344 --> 1:08:53.561
No, my sister was right,
that's fucking stupid, and
I don't wanna talk about it!

1:08:53.563 --> 1:08:55.530
Seriously dude,
this is not the answer.

1:08:55.532 --> 1:08:57.499
If you think revolving
dick door is gonna
make you feel better

1:08:57.500 --> 1:08:59.467
-you're out of your
fucking mind.
-Oh, shut up, Nate.

1:08:59.469 --> 1:09:02.537
Why are you talking like
you have any fucking
moral high ground?

1:09:02.539 --> 1:09:05.273
You get your asshole blown
out every fucking weekend

1:09:05.275 --> 1:09:06.708
because you're
shit-house wasted.

1:09:06.710 --> 1:09:08.376
Accurate, but unacceptable.

1:09:09.446 --> 1:09:10.678
Take pics now.

1:09:10.680 --> 1:09:13.948
Oh, my God.

1:09:13.949 --> 1:09:17.217
I'm gonna say,
"Thirty-six, fat ass, ass up,
door open, Buzz 585."

1:09:17.220 --> 1:09:20.555
-Maxwell, how should I be?
-Um, I don't know,
I would just do like,

1:09:20.557 --> 1:09:22.490
whatever you wanna be
serving when they get here.

1:09:22.492 --> 1:09:23.458
-Maxwell!
-What?

1:09:23.460 --> 1:09:24.559
Shut up, Nate!

1:09:26.296 --> 1:09:28.696
Yeah, so like, I don't
know, just like, bend over,

1:09:28.698 --> 1:09:32.167
tooch your ass up,
and just, like work, bitch.

1:09:32.702 --> 1:09:35.203
-That's how we're working it?
-Yeah, don't show my face.

1:09:35.205 --> 1:09:36.304
Kay.

1:09:41.311 --> 1:09:43.178
[taking picture]

1:09:43.179 --> 1:09:45.046
I don't think I like
what I'm seeing.

1:09:45.047 --> 1:09:46.914
Yeah, as a former face-down
ass-up queen I do
not condone this.

1:09:46.917 --> 1:09:49.751
This is a micro solution
to a macro problem.

1:09:49.753 --> 1:09:52.253
You cannot fill the void
in your life with dicks.

1:09:52.255 --> 1:09:55.073
We've tried!

1:09:55.074 --> 1:09:57.892
And you cannot fill it with
someone meaningful until
you yourself feel meaningful.

1:09:57.894 --> 1:09:59.661
Yeah, Jodie, you can't
go walking down the street

1:09:59.663 --> 1:10:02.263
requiring every man you see
to validate your parking.

1:10:02.265 --> 1:10:04.199
You need to validate
your own parking, okay?

1:10:04.201 --> 1:10:07.502
Having ten dicks inside
of you is guaranteed to
not make you feel better.

1:10:09.406 --> 1:10:10.471
Are you listening?

1:10:10.473 --> 1:10:12.740
Yes, ten dicks. Got it.

1:10:12.742 --> 1:10:14.576
-I got it.
-Great.

1:10:15.445 --> 1:10:17.378
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, guys.

1:10:17.380 --> 1:10:19.781
I'm sorry, Nate, for
what I said before.

1:10:19.783 --> 1:10:21.749
I get it, I do, I get it.

1:10:21.751 --> 1:10:24.519
I don't need a man, but I just-

1:10:24.521 --> 1:10:27.322
I feel like I will feel better
if I get fucked right now.

1:10:27.324 --> 1:10:30.625
And I just-- I need you
guys to just not judge me.

1:10:30.627 --> 1:10:31.960
Alright girl, live your truth.

1:10:31.962 --> 1:10:36.297
Just keep your phone near you
and text us if things get weird.

1:10:52.315 --> 1:10:53.748
[knocking on door]

1:11:17.407 --> 1:11:18.573
Come in!

1:11:20.644 --> 1:11:22.310
[opening door]

1:11:23.480 --> 1:11:24.712
[closing door]

1:12:43.827 --> 1:12:45.126
[man] Thanks.

1:12:51.534 --> 1:12:53.000
[Jodie] You're welcome.

1:12:59.976 --> 1:13:01.709
[knocking on door]

1:13:06.649 --> 1:13:09.550
[opening and closing door]

1:13:49.692 --> 1:13:51.459
[flipping a condom]

1:13:54.998 --> 1:13:56.464
[moaning]

1:14:17.987 --> 1:14:20.588
[panting]

1:14:26.896 --> 1:14:28.796
[taking off condom]

1:14:49.619 --> 1:14:51.252
[knocking on door]

1:14:54.858 --> 1:14:56.557
[opening door]

1:15:06.769 --> 1:15:08.703
[man] You've got a great ass.

1:15:09.005 --> 1:15:09.904
[Jodie] Thanks.

1:15:09.906 --> 1:15:13.140
-[man] Are you ready?
Can I just...
-[Jodie] Yeah.

1:15:21.851 --> 1:15:23.551
[man] Is it okay if
I turn on the light?

1:15:24.554 --> 1:15:25.520
[Jodie] Yeah.

1:15:31.561 --> 1:15:32.860
So, I'm just gonna...

1:15:32.862 --> 1:15:34.228
-Yep.
-Mm-hm.

1:15:34.731 --> 1:15:36.130
[taking condom]

1:15:36.833 --> 1:15:38.266
Okay, I'm just gonna...

1:15:42.572 --> 1:15:43.704
Ahh.

1:15:44.040 --> 1:15:45.907
Ah, yeah.

1:15:49.012 --> 1:15:50.778
Is that okay? Does it feel good?

1:15:50.780 --> 1:15:51.646
Mm-hm.

1:15:51.648 --> 1:15:52.680
Okay, good.

1:15:52.682 --> 1:15:54.181
I want you to feel good.

1:15:57.120 --> 1:16:00.655
Ah-- ah yeah, uh-- Can I, uh...

1:16:01.190 --> 1:16:02.690
Can I ask you a weird question?

1:16:03.960 --> 1:16:05.059
Mm-Hm?

1:16:05.061 --> 1:16:06.994
Can... can I see your face?

1:16:09.299 --> 1:16:11.599
-Will you turn over?
-Yeah, sure. Sure.

1:16:15.004 --> 1:16:16.237
Oh.

1:16:21.711 --> 1:16:22.743
Wow.

1:16:23.713 --> 1:16:25.112
You're beautiful.

1:16:25.982 --> 1:16:27.148
Thanks.

1:16:27.650 --> 1:16:28.983
Ah, yeah.

1:16:29.586 --> 1:16:31.686
Oh, ah.

1:16:32.021 --> 1:16:33.688
Oh, ah.

1:16:33.690 --> 1:16:34.989
Oh, yeah.

1:16:34.991 --> 1:16:36.591
Okay.
