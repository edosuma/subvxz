00:05.700 --> 00:09.150
Let me out of here, po-pos!
You don't know who you're dealing with.

00:18.770 --> 00:21.300
Give Senator Kelly a little
message from the Brotherhood.

00:21.500 --> 00:23.600
There's no stopping the mutants.

00:23.900 --> 00:26.100
And we're coming for him next.

00:27.200 --> 00:30.000
The Brotherhood is now threatening me.

00:30.300 --> 00:32.500
Am I scared? Yes!

00:33.000 --> 00:37.700
As you should be, because
mutants are a danger to us all!

00:38.000 --> 00:42.200
Despite the protection of these
fine officers from the MRD.

00:43.200 --> 00:47.000
They're waging war on us, people.
It's time we fight back!

00:47.500 --> 00:50.200
With this. The Sentinel Prowler.

00:56.300 --> 01:00.550
We're not the ones who picked this fight, Rogue.
We're just standing up for ourselves.

01:00.850 --> 01:04.550
And now they want us to register.
Come on, what's next? Locking us up?

01:04.900 --> 01:07.450
They're going to hit Senator Kelly
at the press conference.

01:07.750 --> 01:10.400
-How do you wanna handle this?
-We stop 'em.

01:11.600 --> 01:13.000
We're too late. It's happening.

01:13.200 --> 01:15.200
Shadowcat, phase us in!

01:16.750 --> 01:18.000
They're not here.

01:20.200 --> 01:21.500
We were set up.

01:21.750 --> 01:26.900
I've been assured by the President that the
Mutant Registration Act will be signed tomorrow.

01:27.200 --> 01:32.000
So the Brotherhood, X-Men,
your days are numbered.

02:40.500 --> 02:41.500
No!

02:42.650 --> 02:45.000
No! No!

03:23.800 --> 03:25.000
That's it.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.800
That's what I want.

03:31.100 --> 03:33.600
A collar? What's it supposed to do?

03:33.900 --> 03:35.000
This.

03:42.150 --> 03:43.000
How--

03:44.900 --> 03:45.700
How--

03:47.200 --> 03:49.300
It shuts down mutant powers.

03:50.600 --> 03:54.600
Oh, and you want us to take it from the X-Men.

04:00.400 --> 04:02.800
Oh, yeah. Well, uh, good luck with that, lady.

04:03.700 --> 04:04.800
I'm sorry.

04:05.200 --> 04:09.300
I was under the impression the Thieves'
Guild actually had thieves in it.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
I'll steal it for you, chere.

04:12.800 --> 04:16.000
Question is: can you afford me?

05:13.000 --> 05:15.750
Well, I guess this is goodbye.

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
You don't have to go back to Brasil, you know.
We got plenty of room at the Institute.

05:20.200 --> 05:21.300
Amara!

05:22.700 --> 05:24.200
I can't.

05:24.450 --> 05:27.850
If you ever change your mind,
it's a standing invitation.

05:28.300 --> 05:31.100
Thank you. Goodbye.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.200
Uh, Amara. I have to take the collar back.

05:35.500 --> 05:38.050
-Please, let me keep it.
-I would.

05:38.350 --> 05:41.400
But unfortunately it ain't
healthy to wear it too long.

05:42.450 --> 05:43.450
Okay.

06:09.750 --> 06:12.100
So how did it work?
It did work, right?

06:12.450 --> 06:15.000
-Were her powers successfully inhabited?
-Oh, yeah.

06:15.300 --> 06:19.200
-Just in time to save a building full of people.
-You don't sound happy.

06:19.500 --> 06:23.100
The MRD chased that poor
girl into a populated area.

06:23.400 --> 06:24.700
Why?

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
Oh, so everyone could see a mutant
putting the public in danger.

06:29.450 --> 06:33.300
Senator Kelly's way of excusing his crusade.

06:33.850 --> 06:38.000
But you did good, Forge.
Just make it safer for long-term use.

06:38.650 --> 06:40.100
We'll be needing it.

06:40.900 --> 06:43.000
Yeah. See you in the morning.

07:25.650 --> 07:28.700
I'm doing my best here, Charles. I really am.

07:30.100 --> 07:33.600
But there are kids out there who
are struggling with their powers.

07:33.950 --> 07:36.800
And I just can't help 'em like you could.

07:40.300 --> 07:42.000
Well, 'night, Chuck.

08:50.500 --> 08:53.200
The collar. As promised.

08:54.500 --> 08:57.000
Your fee. As promised.

08:57.300 --> 08:59.300
-And a bonus.
-For?

08:59.700 --> 09:03.300
Your silence. This transaction never happened.

09:06.700 --> 09:08.300
They never do.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.800
Phase one complete.
We have the collar.

09:15.100 --> 09:17.000
Thank you, Miss Zane.

09:17.900 --> 09:20.800
You may proceed as planned.

09:45.200 --> 09:46.300
Ah.

09:51.600 --> 09:54.700
I sense someone is angry, yeah?

09:55.400 --> 09:56.000
Yes.

09:56.400 --> 09:58.200
The collar, bub. Now!

09:58.800 --> 10:02.600
Too late, my friend. It has
already been converted into cash.

10:04.500 --> 10:06.300
So who has it?

10:06.600 --> 10:08.700
I didn't get her name,

10:09.100 --> 10:11.700
but she may have given me her card.

10:12.500 --> 10:14.000
Ah, yes.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.200
Oh. No, sorry. It's one of mine.

10:27.350 --> 10:28.500
Mon Dieu!

10:34.700 --> 10:36.600
I trust you have had enough.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.500
Oh, I'm just getting started.

10:47.700 --> 10:49.300
C'est la vie.

10:50.550 --> 10:52.950
Let's try us a new deal.

11:11.500 --> 11:13.700
You didn't let me cut the deck.

11:14.200 --> 11:17.300
Now, who'd you sell the collar to?

11:18.100 --> 11:21.900
Rule number one of the Thieves' Guild:
never reveal a client.

11:23.300 --> 11:27.400
That collar, it'll be used against mutants.

11:27.700 --> 11:30.600
-You knew that, right?
-Yes, I knew that.

11:31.000 --> 11:34.300
And you still sold out
your kind for a little cash.

11:34.600 --> 11:39.000
Absolutement non! I sold out my
kind for a large amount of cash.

11:39.650 --> 11:41.000
There is a difference.

11:45.300 --> 11:48.000
-This cash?
-Exactly.

11:48.500 --> 11:49.800
No!

11:54.700 --> 11:56.700
-Are you insane?!
-Probably.

11:57.400 --> 11:59.100
'Cause I'm gonna hire you.

11:59.400 --> 12:02.400
Just lead me to your buyer,
and I'll pay you double.

12:02.700 --> 12:05.600
You're somehow under the
impression I know where she is.

12:06.200 --> 12:10.800
Rule number two of the Thieves' Guild:
always know your customers.

12:58.250 --> 13:02.950
I've warned you before, Miss Zane.
You cannot simply drive a vehicle into the main lab.

13:03.190 --> 13:05.700
The exhaust fumes will
contaminate the work environment.

13:06.600 --> 13:09.100
Begin reverse engineering
this device immediately.

13:09.400 --> 13:11.300
-You actually got it?
-Of course.

13:11.600 --> 13:13.800
And I want to be updated on your progress.

13:14.100 --> 13:18.300
In the meantime, I'll be checking
the status of your other projects.

13:18.600 --> 13:21.250
Why? Dosen't the Senator trust me?

13:21.550 --> 13:25.800
After your fiasco with the Prowler,
you're lucky to still have a job.

13:36.350 --> 13:38.500
Incredible.

13:39.000 --> 13:44.000
It appears the mutant fight
has just shifted in our favor.

13:55.100 --> 13:57.600
-What is this place?
-Don't know.

13:57.900 --> 14:00.250
But my client come here quite often.

14:01.600 --> 14:07.000
-Nitrous oxide residue. And high-octane fuel.
-She do like to drive fast.

14:07.370 --> 14:11.700
Well, if she's into living
dangerously, this is her lucky day.

14:12.350 --> 14:14.250
What? Excuse me!

14:22.200 --> 14:23.700
Where do you think you're going?

14:27.300 --> 14:28.300
In there.

14:29.800 --> 14:33.650
You hired me for my skills, huh?
Then allow me to use them.

14:34.000 --> 14:39.300
Don't see what's wrong with just slashing my way in there,
kicking everybody through a wall and taking the collar back.

14:40.650 --> 14:42.700
An excellent plan B.

14:43.100 --> 14:46.900
But let's start with a little
more subtle approach, shall we?

15:02.400 --> 15:04.650
So now what? Air ducts?

15:05.600 --> 15:09.600
Only in the world of cinema.
In real life, they never hold.

15:33.300 --> 15:34.700
Are you always this much help?

15:35.300 --> 15:36.500
Yep.

15:51.300 --> 15:55.350
That's my client. Sybil Zane.
Beautiful, huh?

15:56.200 --> 15:59.600
If not for rule number three,
which sadly prevents me and her from--

15:59.900 --> 16:02.300
Yeah. Spare me the details.

16:06.400 --> 16:09.500
That scoundrel, however, I do not know.

16:12.400 --> 16:16.300
Name's Bolivar Trask.
He's the gadget man behind the MRD,

16:16.600 --> 16:19.650
which means it's Senator Kelly
who wanted the collar.

16:20.550 --> 16:24.700
Well, for an added fee, I can devise
a strategy for stealing the collar back,

16:24.950 --> 16:26.700
-then you--
-Let's just go with mine.

16:26.950 --> 16:29.250
-Which is?
-Plan B.

16:45.900 --> 16:47.270
Bad move.

16:56.600 --> 16:58.300
I don't think so, chere.

16:58.800 --> 17:00.250
Now hand over that collar.

17:00.600 --> 17:03.800
-We had a deal!
-And now we have a new one.

17:04.099 --> 17:08.200
You give me the collar, and I convince
my friend to leave you in one piece.

17:15.599 --> 17:19.050
-Get away from my car!
-As you wish.

17:30.300 --> 17:33.500
And once again, the prize is mine.

17:34.950 --> 17:38.700
This seem like a good time to
renegotiate our agreement, no?

17:39.600 --> 17:41.500
I don't recommend it.

17:42.200 --> 17:48.200
Sorry, but double pay is just not enough,
especially putting up with you.

20:37.750 --> 20:40.100
The Prowlers are running wild! Go!

21:01.300 --> 21:03.850
What are you waiting for?!
Drop that thing!

21:04.150 --> 21:06.700
No problem. Just give me the collar.

21:07.450 --> 21:10.000
What? Are you out of your mind?!

21:11.200 --> 21:12.450
The collar, please.

21:15.350 --> 21:17.500
All right. Here.

21:19.500 --> 21:20.900
So long, Wolverine.

21:43.750 --> 21:45.400
That swine!

22:02.400 --> 22:04.300
We need better locks.
