WEBVTT

00:09.266 --> 00:11.541
Half-caf latte, please.

00:13.353 --> 00:16.709
- I like this new system. It's lively.
- What can I get for you?

00:17.024 --> 00:19.697
I'll have a double short,
low-fat, no-foam latte.

00:19.985 --> 00:24.501
- Double short, low-fat, no-foam latte.
- Double short, non-fat, low-foam latte.

00:24.865 --> 00:29.017
I think there was a problem.
The middle person reversed part of it.

00:29.369 --> 00:32.042
She said double short, non-fat,
low-foam latte.

00:32.331 --> 00:36.768
- Double short, non-fat, low-foam latte.
- Double short, non-fat, low-foam latte.

00:37.127 --> 00:39.641
No, you did it again.
That's not what I want.

00:39.921 --> 00:42.276
You can just tell her yourself.

00:42.549 --> 00:44.824
A double short, low-fat, no-foam latte.

00:45.093 --> 00:47.846
Double short, low-fat, no-foam latte.

00:48.138 --> 00:49.127
- Nutmeg?
- Nutmeg?

00:49.348 --> 00:51.816
No, thanks.
It inflames my stomach lining.

00:52.100 --> 00:54.978
Inflames his stomach lining.

00:55.270 --> 00:57.420
Stop that.

00:57.689 --> 00:59.839
- Hello, Niles.
- Welcome back.

01:00.108 --> 01:02.668
I trust you and Samantha
had a pleasant weekend?

01:02.944 --> 01:06.619
It was fabulous. We stayed at this
gorgeous cabin just outside Aspen,

01:06.948 --> 01:10.463
took a chopper every day up
the mountain. I didn't want it to end.

01:10.786 --> 01:15.018
Is that why you're still wearing
that jacket in an overheated cafe?

01:15.374 --> 01:18.889
In Aspen we all wear them indoors.
The funniest thing happened.

01:19.211 --> 01:21.202
Jack Nicholson and Tom Brokaw

01:21.463 --> 01:24.375
were wearing the same jacket,
so they staged a fight.

01:24.675 --> 01:26.506
Donna Karan flew in to referee.

01:26.760 --> 01:30.799
I laughed so hard I nearly spilled my
toddy on someone named Boof Daddy.

01:31.139 --> 01:33.369
Can I get anything else?

01:33.642 --> 01:36.759
A dustpan and broom to sweep up
some of these names.

01:38.647 --> 01:40.126
Cappuccino, please.

01:40.357 --> 01:43.508
- Niles, did we have plans for tonight?
- Yes, why?

01:43.819 --> 01:49.098
It's my one-month anniversary with Sam.
I'd like to take her to L'Escalier.

01:49.491 --> 01:51.766
I understand. One month is a milestone.

01:52.035 --> 01:55.152
Thanks for the reminder.
I need to change my water filter.

01:56.623 --> 01:58.375
They put nutmeg on this.

01:58.625 --> 02:01.059
Meg Ryan told me
about the practical joke

02:01.336 --> 02:04.408
Tony Hopkins played on Jodie
at the wrap party for <i>Lambs.</i>

02:04.715 --> 02:08.071
My stomach lining is just not going
to get a break today, is it?

02:13.765 --> 02:16.643
- Sorry I was late.
- That's all right.

02:16.935 --> 02:19.529
I ordered us
the "Taste of Monaco" dinner.

02:19.813 --> 02:21.451
Good choice.

02:21.690 --> 02:24.523
That's what you ordered
on our first date.

02:24.818 --> 02:27.890
Of course, it wasn't food
you were craving that night.

02:28.196 --> 02:33.111
You whisked me away back to my place
before the crab cakes could even arrive.

02:33.493 --> 02:36.451
There's no better way
to celebrate an anniversary

02:36.747 --> 02:39.261
than with an historical re-enactment.

02:39.541 --> 02:41.736
I've got my costume on underneath.

02:42.002 --> 02:44.835
I'm really looking forward
to those crab cakes.

02:45.130 --> 02:49.009
Great. Well, yes, I suppose
we should try the food here once.

02:49.343 --> 02:54.736
But leave some room. You'll find
a Frasier mint on your pillow later.

02:55.140 --> 02:58.416
By the way,
thanks again for this weekend.

02:58.727 --> 03:00.558
You're welcome.

03:00.812 --> 03:05.681
I think it was a turning point for us.
Well, for me. See, I was so relaxed.

03:06.068 --> 03:08.787
I'm usually very tentative.

03:09.071 --> 03:12.427
I have this dark fear
that I'm about to be cut loose.

03:12.741 --> 03:15.778
- Frasier?
- I'm just being so insecure.

03:16.078 --> 03:18.717
It's nice to know I'm on solid ground.

03:18.997 --> 03:22.990
- Frasier...
- I'm standing on quicksand, aren't I?

03:24.086 --> 03:26.964
I didn't want to talk about this
until later. It's...

03:27.881 --> 03:30.349
It's just not working out
between the two of us.

03:30.634 --> 03:35.105
No, it's not you. It's me. I just don't
feel the same way about us anymore.

03:35.472 --> 03:38.430
But things were going so well.
What happened?

03:38.725 --> 03:41.717
Nothing happened.
We've had a wonderful time together.

03:42.020 --> 03:44.170
It's just run its course.

03:45.774 --> 03:47.127
I'm sorry.

03:50.237 --> 03:51.955
I'm sorry, too.

03:52.197 --> 03:56.270
- I hope we can still be friends.
- Yes, I'd like that, too.

03:57.119 --> 03:59.269
Seeing as how we're friends and all,

03:59.538 --> 04:03.417
there's no reason we shouldn't
enjoy what's sure to be a splendid meal.

04:03.750 --> 04:06.344
- Absolutely.
- Great. OK.

04:10.424 --> 04:13.063
- Your first course.
- Thank you.

04:14.886 --> 04:17.639
- How many more courses are there?
- Six, sir.

04:17.930 --> 04:20.365
Could you bring those all at once?

04:26.064 --> 04:28.862
Good Lord. Look at this headline.

04:31.153 --> 04:33.713
"Martin Crane Dead".

04:33.989 --> 04:36.025
You don't need much coffee after that.

04:37.200 --> 04:39.873
58. Poor guy. Hardly had a life.

04:40.162 --> 04:42.960
- Handsome fellow.
- Yeah. Multi-millionaire.

04:43.248 --> 04:48.561
Decorated war hero. Wrote a spy novel.
"Survived by his wife Florence,

04:48.962 --> 04:53.240
a former Miss Washington and
two sons, Joe, a Marine Corps colonel,

04:53.592 --> 04:56.584
and professional baseball player
Mickey Crane".

04:58.722 --> 05:02.431
Nothing like starting the day off
jealous of a dead guy.

05:04.853 --> 05:07.287
- Hello, all.
- Morning, Dr Crane.

05:07.564 --> 05:11.398
- You were up and out early today.
- I felt like taking a walk.

05:11.735 --> 05:14.169
Got a lot on my mind.
Picked up some pastries.

05:14.446 --> 05:18.837
Whatever it is, you'll cheer up when you
see these photos from your ski weekend.

05:19.993 --> 05:24.509
I admit, I took a peek. I must say,
this Sam of yours is quite a catch.

05:24.873 --> 05:27.706
She's gorgeous, smart, stylish...

05:28.001 --> 05:30.640
- We broke up last night.
- Orange juice, anyone?

05:32.089 --> 05:36.162
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- It was a mutual decision.

05:36.510 --> 05:39.980
A little more mutual
on her part than mine.

05:40.305 --> 05:42.944
Once she dumped me,
I jumped right on board.

05:44.142 --> 05:47.418
- Anyway, I'll be fine, Dad.
- Just put it all behind you.

05:47.729 --> 05:51.927
Exactly. I must admit, I'm having
a little difficulty achieving closure.

05:52.275 --> 05:55.426
Sam said that her feelings changed
for no reason.

05:55.737 --> 05:59.332
I think it might have been
something specific about me.

05:59.658 --> 06:02.934
- Don't make this your fault.
- She's probably telling the truth.

06:03.245 --> 06:07.397
If she's trying to spare your feelings,
it'll be "It's not you, it's me".

06:08.875 --> 06:12.231
- That's exactly what she said.
- Waffles, anyone?

06:12.546 --> 06:16.505
You always look for explanations
but sometimes there isn't one.

06:16.842 --> 06:20.676
I know, Dad.
It's going to drive me crazy.

06:21.346 --> 06:24.895
Until I know why it ended,
I'll assume it was any number of things.

06:25.225 --> 06:28.774
- My self-confidence will be shattered.
- You got two choices.

06:29.104 --> 06:31.459
You can spend days
trying to figure it out.

06:31.732 --> 06:34.565
Or you can make a clean break,
never talk to her again,

06:34.860 --> 06:36.851
and get on with your life.

06:40.407 --> 06:43.558
That's exactly what I should do.
Thank you.

06:43.869 --> 06:47.418
- No problem.
- Sometimes you're very insightful.

06:47.748 --> 06:49.864
I've been around the block a few times.

06:52.252 --> 06:56.006
- So when are you going to talk to her?
- Right after my waffles.

06:58.000 --> 07:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:06.266 --> 07:11.386
Sam! What are the chances?
You've found my thinking place.

07:11.772 --> 07:15.287
Frasier, listen,
I'm ten minutes late for a deposition.

07:15.609 --> 07:18.442
- We can walk and talk.
- All right.

07:19.696 --> 07:23.894
I love our new arrangement. This being
friends thing's going to work out great.

07:24.242 --> 07:27.632
Could you pick up the pace a little?

07:27.954 --> 07:30.388
- How have you been?
- I just saw you last night.

07:30.666 --> 07:32.657
Now that you bring up last night...

07:32.918 --> 07:37.434
You do walk fast.
I was hoping for a little clarification.

07:37.798 --> 07:39.868
This has nothing to do with you.

07:40.133 --> 07:43.967
Yes, but it seems highly unlikely
that such a sudden change

07:44.304 --> 07:46.864
could have nothing to do with me.

07:47.140 --> 07:50.450
Maybe it was something
that I did unintentionally.

07:50.769 --> 07:53.203
I'm not sure. Sorry. My fault.

07:53.480 --> 07:56.631
Something this weekend maybe?
I played the piano too long,

07:56.942 --> 07:59.820
but who knew General Schwarzkopf
loved show tunes?

08:00.112 --> 08:03.070
All right.
There's nothing I'm not telling you.

08:03.365 --> 08:07.199
Sometimes things just end.
Please try not to take it so personally.

08:08.620 --> 08:10.656
- All right.
- Look, I really am late.

08:10.914 --> 08:12.950
I'll talk to you soon, OK?

08:14.251 --> 08:16.162
Take care.

08:21.258 --> 08:23.249
What's the matter with you?

08:23.510 --> 08:25.501
That's just it.

08:25.762 --> 08:27.753
I don't know.

08:32.436 --> 08:35.951
Where is Frasier? He knows we have
reservations at Bavetta's.

08:36.273 --> 08:40.630
If you're late, they make you sit
in the kitchen with the owner's mother.

08:42.779 --> 08:46.567
What did I do with that remote?
Daph, are you sure you haven't seen it?

08:46.908 --> 08:51.026
- Positive.
- They ought to make one with a sensor.

08:51.371 --> 08:54.329
20 feet from the TV and it beeps.

08:54.624 --> 08:59.573
Or for a deaf person, they could make
one with purple smoke coming out of it

08:59.963 --> 09:02.602
like some kind
of flare system or something.

09:02.883 --> 09:05.397
Please!
You've got to get out of the house more.

09:09.264 --> 09:12.017
Hello, all.
Niles, what a pleasant surprise.

09:12.309 --> 09:15.346
Just what Mama Bavetta will say
when we pull up a chair.

09:15.646 --> 09:17.955
Dinner. I completely forgot.

09:18.231 --> 09:21.064
I took a long walk after work.
I'm sorry, Niles.

09:21.360 --> 09:23.510
It must have slipped my mind.

09:23.779 --> 09:26.657
You're still consumed
with the Sam situation?

09:26.948 --> 09:30.463
- Trying to figure out what happened.
- The relationship ended.

09:30.786 --> 09:33.141
- There's got to be a reason.
- You're fixated.

09:33.413 --> 09:36.883
I am not. That is fixated.
Dad, what are you doing?

09:38.085 --> 09:42.317
This is stupid. Maybe if I stick
together about ten chopsticks,

09:42.673 --> 09:44.868
put a rubber tip on the end
for gripping.

09:49.680 --> 09:51.671
- Hello.
- Be ready in a sec, Roz.

09:51.932 --> 09:55.561
- The movie doesn't start till eight.
- I forgot you two had plans.

09:55.894 --> 09:57.885
I was wondering...

09:58.146 --> 10:00.376
No, I don't know
why Sam broke up with you.

10:00.649 --> 10:03.846
Just like I didn't know two hours ago.
Just like Gil, Bulldog

10:04.152 --> 10:08.668
and Miss Judy from
the Arts and Crafts Hour didn't know.

10:09.032 --> 10:12.547
Never hurts to ask.
Miss Judy had some real insights

10:12.869 --> 10:15.702
before she had to make her
Popsicle stick run.

10:15.998 --> 10:21.948
- I'm going to watch the game at Duke's.
- Wait. I'd like to ask a favour.

10:22.379 --> 10:24.415
In the spirit of self-improvement,

10:24.673 --> 10:27.745
I'd like you to tell me
in your own words

10:28.051 --> 10:31.646
what about me you find unlovable.

10:34.641 --> 10:39.920
Please, honestly, for the sake
of my future relationships.

10:40.314 --> 10:42.703
I know you're afraid
to hurt my feelings,

10:42.983 --> 10:45.895
but I can stand
a little constructive criticism.

10:46.194 --> 10:49.072
Tell me, what do you
think are my main faults?

10:49.364 --> 10:52.481
Let's start with this.
You analyse everything to death.

10:52.784 --> 10:56.413
Sam said it wasn't your fault,
but you keep digging around

10:56.747 --> 10:58.738
until you drive everybody nuts.

10:58.999 --> 11:01.911
Dad thinks I am over-analytical.

11:02.210 --> 11:04.440
That's great.
OK, who's next? Niles?

11:04.713 --> 11:07.432
I'm not sure
how useful this exercise is.

11:07.716 --> 11:10.071
- You're going to participate.
- Pushy.

11:10.344 --> 11:13.495
Yes, if that's what it takes to...
Oh, thank you.

11:15.974 --> 11:18.488
Daphne, it's your turn. Don't be shy.

11:18.769 --> 11:23.126
Well, if I had to choose,
I'd say you are a bit of a fussbudget.

11:23.482 --> 11:28.078
If you don't mind this substitution,
"demanding" is more <i>le motjuste.</i>

11:28.445 --> 11:31.562
- Pretentious.
- Right. Now see, this is very good.

11:31.865 --> 11:33.184
Roz?

11:33.408 --> 11:38.084
- You're a little full of yourself.
- Great. OK. Pompous.

11:38.455 --> 11:40.810
And you do tend to ramble on
with the callers.

11:41.083 --> 11:43.438
- Tad loquacious.
- Pretentious.

11:43.710 --> 11:46.941
- Dad, I already wrote that down.
- Underline it.

11:54.179 --> 11:56.693
- Snippy.
- Sarcastic.

11:56.974 --> 11:58.327
- Bossy.
- Huffy.

11:58.558 --> 12:00.310
- Vain.
- That's a good one.

12:02.396 --> 12:07.675
How nice. We finally found an activity
we can all enjoy together.

12:08.068 --> 12:10.138
Why don't you
admit what you're doing?

12:10.404 --> 12:12.918
This isn't a
"help me be a better person" thing.

12:13.198 --> 12:15.507
You're trying to win Sam back.

12:15.784 --> 12:19.094
- That's preposterous.
- Look who you're talking to.

12:19.413 --> 12:22.962
I've been down this road so many times
they call it the Roz Expressway.

12:23.291 --> 12:27.330
I've heard that phrase before,
but in a slightly different context.

12:32.134 --> 12:35.922
Maybe there is some truth
in what you say.

12:36.263 --> 12:40.142
I mean, after all,
Sam is really quite a catch.

12:40.475 --> 12:42.466
Why wouldn't I want to get her back?

12:42.728 --> 12:46.721
But you shouldn't change yourself
just to please her. It's not healthy,

12:47.065 --> 12:50.455
and it doesn't work. If it did,
Steve Wilson would be my husband

12:50.777 --> 12:54.770
and not just some name
tattooed on my butt.

12:55.115 --> 12:57.834
The best thing you can do is nothing.

12:58.118 --> 13:00.348
Let her think about what she's missing.

13:00.620 --> 13:04.932
I totally agree. No candy. No flowers.
And whatever you do, don't call.

13:05.917 --> 13:09.193
Nothing wrong with
keeping the lines of communication open.

13:09.504 --> 13:13.816
- You called, didn't you?
- I left a carefully worded message.

13:14.176 --> 13:17.009
You never call.
It makes you look desperate.

13:17.304 --> 13:20.694
I didn't have any choice.
She wouldn't return any of my pages.

13:25.646 --> 13:29.480
- I've blown it, haven't I?
- What did you say on your message?

13:29.816 --> 13:33.172
Nothing undignified. Of course,
tone of voice is everything.

13:33.487 --> 13:35.125
I should play them for you.

13:35.364 --> 13:38.276
- You have her access code?
- Yes, I set it up with her.

13:38.575 --> 13:41.328
I gave her an easy to remember code.
My birthday.

13:41.620 --> 13:43.895
What's so easy about May 7th?

13:44.164 --> 13:46.883
I wouldn't know, Dad.
My birthday's in March.

13:48.293 --> 13:51.251
That's right. The 7th.
That's Eddie's.

13:52.923 --> 13:57.474
Here we go. All right, now, listen and
tell me if you think I sound desperate.

13:59.096 --> 14:02.293
<i>Hi, Sam. Two quick things:
dinner at L'Escalier is now at 8.30</i>

14:02.599 --> 14:06.478
<i>and the judge needs to see you at nine
tomorrow morning, not ten. Bye.</i>

14:06.812 --> 14:09.849
- Not desperate, feminine.
- Shut up, Niles.

14:11.441 --> 14:15.116
<i>Hello, Sam. It's Frasier.
Give me a call if you get a chance. Bye.</i>

14:15.445 --> 14:17.834
You don't sound desperate at all.

14:18.115 --> 14:22.711
<i>Hi, Sam. I'll be at the office.
Call me. It's Frasier.</i>

14:23.620 --> 14:26.054
Maybe just a whiff of desperation.

14:27.457 --> 14:30.369
<i>Hi, I'm at the office now.</i>

14:30.669 --> 14:32.899
<i>Still at the office.</i>

14:33.171 --> 14:36.800
<i>I stepped out to the coffee machine.
Thought I might have missed you.</i>

14:37.134 --> 14:39.568
How quickly a whiff becomes a stench.

14:40.429 --> 14:42.420
They just get worse after that.

14:42.723 --> 14:45.237
- There's more?
- Yes, not any more, though.

14:45.517 --> 14:49.146
- There. Messages erased.
- Your messages weren't the only ones.

14:49.479 --> 14:52.516
What about the one
about the meeting with the judge?

14:52.816 --> 14:56.855
- You're right.
- What are you going to do about it?

14:57.195 --> 14:59.425
I could call saying
I erased that message

14:59.698 --> 15:01.689
while erasing messages I left earlier.

15:02.034 --> 15:06.869
- With her secret access code.
- Oh, God, this is humiliating.

15:07.247 --> 15:11.206
I hate to appear unsupportive, but
I've got to get to Duke's for the game.

15:11.543 --> 15:15.456
- And we'll be late for that movie.
- Wait. I forgot my purse.

15:15.797 --> 15:19.676
Don't worry about it, Frasier.
You'll be fine. You'll bounce back.

15:20.010 --> 15:22.126
- You're tough.
- And resourceful.

15:22.387 --> 15:24.105
- Resilient.
- Optimistic.

15:24.348 --> 15:25.986
- Tenacious.
- Conceited.

15:26.224 --> 15:28.021
Different list, Daph.

15:29.186 --> 15:31.859
See you all.

15:32.147 --> 15:36.106
Hard to believe this picture was taken
only three days ago.

15:37.694 --> 15:40.254
Look at us. How happy I was.

15:41.198 --> 15:43.189
Now I'll never see her again.

15:43.450 --> 15:46.681
Aren't you over-dramatising?
You're bound to run into her.

15:46.995 --> 15:50.510
No, I was talking about
me and Lesley Stahl.

15:50.832 --> 15:53.300
Looking at these photos,
I can't help noticing

15:53.585 --> 15:55.894
there are very few
of you and Sam together.

15:56.171 --> 15:59.049
- What are you getting at?
- I'm just wondering how much

15:59.341 --> 16:03.539
- you really feel for this woman.
- I haven't felt this way in ages.

16:03.887 --> 16:06.321
I'm sorry. Guess I was wrong.
It's love then.

16:07.683 --> 16:13.474
I don't know about love. I mean, we've
only been seeing each other for a month.

16:13.897 --> 16:16.092
But you could fall in love with her.

16:16.358 --> 16:17.632
Possibly.

16:17.859 --> 16:20.692
- Sometime down the line.
- Yes. Perhaps.

16:20.988 --> 16:22.979
Well, no wonder you're heartbroken.

16:23.240 --> 16:26.312
You've just lost the only woman
you could even possibly,

16:26.618 --> 16:30.691
sometime down the line,
perhaps fall in love with.

16:31.039 --> 16:35.078
I'm surprised the country music people
haven't jumped all over this one.

16:41.425 --> 16:44.098
So I don't rhapsodise about her.

16:44.386 --> 16:47.219
You did rhapsodise
when she took you to Cigare Volant

16:47.514 --> 16:50.950
and you were seated in a secret
VIP room we never knew existed.

16:51.268 --> 16:55.022
Are you suggesting I'm so shallow
I was with her for her connections?

16:55.355 --> 16:59.587
Let's face it, you've always had
a yearning to run with the cool kids,

16:59.943 --> 17:03.982
and it's never worked out for you.
Your one day on the football team.

17:05.824 --> 17:08.736
The summer you bought a motorcycle.
Although...

17:09.036 --> 17:12.028
It's only a moped if you pedal it,
and I never pedalled.

17:14.540 --> 17:17.977
I just wonder if what you're mourning
isn't so much the loss of Sam

17:18.295 --> 17:21.252
as the loss of her celebrity lifestyle.

17:21.548 --> 17:25.063
I must admit things never
did seem quite right between us.

17:25.385 --> 17:29.503
If it hadn't been for her friends, l
probably would've broken it off myself.

17:29.848 --> 17:33.045
- Shame on me.
- Don't punish yourself, Frasier.

17:33.352 --> 17:36.389
At least you're deep enough
to realise you're shallow.

17:40.108 --> 17:42.099
- Dinner?
- Let's.

17:42.611 --> 17:45.728
Although I've still
got to phone her about that message.

17:46.031 --> 17:50.070
Why don't we stop by L'Escalier
on our way? You can tell her in person.

17:50.410 --> 17:53.925
Even better. Niles, I can't tell
you how helpful this has been.

17:54.247 --> 17:56.238
How can I ever repay you?

17:56.500 --> 17:59.173
You can get me
into that VIP room at Cigare Volant.

17:59.461 --> 18:02.339
Where is the entrance?
Behind the cigarette machine?

18:02.631 --> 18:06.021
No, that's just a decoy. It's through
the dry-cleaner next door.

18:13.892 --> 18:15.883
- Hello, Sam.
- Frasier.

18:16.144 --> 18:18.897
- I know you didn't expect to see me.
- No.

18:19.189 --> 18:22.306
Of course, after those messages,
I can't say I'm surprised.

18:22.609 --> 18:24.281
You heard them?

18:24.528 --> 18:27.725
I checked my machine.
Frasier, we really need to talk.

18:28.031 --> 18:32.661
No, we don't. I promise you,
I will never call you again.

18:33.036 --> 18:35.948
I've thought about it and
you made the right decision.

18:36.248 --> 18:39.206
- No, I didn't.
- Excuse me?

18:39.501 --> 18:43.699
Please, sit down. I was going
to call you later anyway.

18:44.047 --> 18:48.563
You see, I think I figured out
what happened between the two of us.

18:48.927 --> 18:51.725
I panicked.
I was starting to really care about you,

18:52.014 --> 18:56.007
thought we might have a future even
and, well, it scared me.

18:56.351 --> 18:59.423
But the way you've pursued me,
showing up at the courthouse,

18:59.730 --> 19:03.359
and leaving all of those messages.
Well, and now you're here.

19:03.692 --> 19:08.129
Obviously you feel just as strongly
as I do. It's funny really.

19:08.488 --> 19:12.447
Both of us falling in love and not
realising the other felt the same way.

19:12.784 --> 19:14.012
We should be laughing.

19:24.296 --> 19:25.445
Listen, Sam...

19:25.672 --> 19:29.028
No. I'm going to tell you what
we'll be doing this weekend.

19:29.343 --> 19:33.973
We are taking the Concorde to London
for a party at Alec Guinness' place.

19:34.348 --> 19:37.226
Well, I'm not so sure...
Sir Alec Guinness?

19:37.517 --> 19:41.112
I know it's a long way to go,
but Stephen is going to be there

19:41.438 --> 19:43.827
and he'll play some songs
from the new one.

19:44.107 --> 19:46.621
I don't know if...
Stephen Sondheim?

19:46.902 --> 19:50.861
- Guess who's singing with him.
- No, please, don't tell me. Please.

19:51.198 --> 19:54.554
Frasier, what is it?
You seem upset.

19:57.663 --> 19:59.813
Sam, I can't see you anymore.

20:00.082 --> 20:01.197
What?

20:01.416 --> 20:07.048
You're an incredible woman,
but I've come to a realisation about us.

20:07.464 --> 20:11.537
Well, about me.
And I just don't see any future for us.

20:11.885 --> 20:15.082
I know it sounds strange
after the way I was pursuing you,

20:15.389 --> 20:18.745
but I've been in it
for all the wrong reasons.

20:19.059 --> 20:23.849
- Like what?
- I'm not very proud of this but

20:24.231 --> 20:28.270
maybe I was a little dazzled
by the circle you travel in.

20:28.610 --> 20:32.125
So you were with me just so you could be
around some famous people?

20:32.447 --> 20:35.917
- I was fond of you as well.
- Fond of me? Thank you very much.

20:36.243 --> 20:39.121
I understand you're upset
and I'm going to go.

20:39.413 --> 20:41.290
I don't believe this. My friends.

20:41.540 --> 20:46.409
Look, I know it's shallow and it's
something I'm going to have to work on.

20:46.795 --> 20:50.470
- Hi, Sam. How are you?
- Lesley. Hello.

20:50.799 --> 20:53.267
It's Frasier Crane. We met this weekend.

20:53.552 --> 20:57.943
- How are you?
- What kind of sick bastard are you?

20:59.182 --> 21:01.537
You're right.
We're having a bit of a spat,

21:01.810 --> 21:05.883
but of course I don't need to tell you
being the ace reporter that you are.

21:06.231 --> 21:08.791
Just get out of here right now.

21:09.067 --> 21:12.264
- Maybe we could have lunch.
- Get out.

21:12.571 --> 21:15.324
What's the matter with me?

21:15.615 --> 21:17.367
Lesley...
