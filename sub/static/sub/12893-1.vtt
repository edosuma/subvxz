00:58.407 --> 01:02.002
You've got spunk, Wolfhouse.
I'll give you that.

01:02.177 --> 01:04.611
I don't got room in my
pocket for more of your money.

01:05.180 --> 01:07.614
I got a little spunk for you.

01:12.855 --> 01:17.451
You couldn't hit your own ball bag
with your own wrinkled cock.

01:20.295 --> 01:21.284
Chance.

01:22.998 --> 01:26.900
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
You play rim rules?

01:27.069 --> 01:28.263
Doesn't everybody?

01:28.437 --> 01:30.928
Yeah, the shit-stabbers like you.

01:31.573 --> 01:32.767
Hold on there, girlfriend.

01:35.210 --> 01:36.438
You're gonna chance...

01:38.213 --> 01:40.681
...you're gonna have to earn it.

01:42.618 --> 01:44.313
Oh, no. No way.

01:44.953 --> 01:48.184
Forget about it.
I'm out of here. Where's my--?

01:49.091 --> 01:53.960
Hey. You said you wanted to chance,
now take a chance.

01:55.230 --> 01:57.061
All right, all right.

02:02.938 --> 02:03.996
Son of a bitch!

02:04.173 --> 02:05.299
Up yours, Johnny Cash.

02:05.474 --> 02:07.601
Okay. Grab him, boys.

02:09.144 --> 02:11.977
You weren't trying to play me for
a fool, were you, Wolfhouse?

02:12.147 --> 02:13.136
Beginner's luck.

02:13.315 --> 02:16.751
You don't come into my place of business
and take my money like that.

02:16.919 --> 02:20.320
Now, what I should do is
beat seven shades of shit out of you.

02:20.489 --> 02:23.322
- But I'll teach you something somebody--
- Hey!

02:23.826 --> 02:25.157
What's going on down here?

02:25.327 --> 02:27.124
Todd, welcome home!

02:27.296 --> 02:30.163
I'm just having some fun with your
younger, dumber brother.

02:30.332 --> 02:32.596
Might not be the best time.
Everyone's waiting.

02:32.768 --> 02:33.826
Oh, of course.

02:39.775 --> 02:40.764
Padre?

02:51.386 --> 02:52.978
I'll come back for the rest.

03:10.706 --> 03:13.197
Great Gam Gam. I'm so sorry.

03:14.610 --> 03:16.237
My friends...

03:16.411 --> 03:20.905
...as we gather today to mourn
the passing of Johan Wolfhouse...

03:21.850 --> 03:26.685
...what can I say that
Johan can't say for himself?

03:28.357 --> 03:30.086
<i>Hello, all.</i>

03:31.360 --> 03:36.388
<i>If you are watching this,
then I have croaked.</i>

03:36.798 --> 03:42.168
<i>Now I will never know what happens on
The Young and the Restless.</i>

03:42.838 --> 03:46.205
<i>-He loved that show.
- But seriously, I wanted to thank you all...</i>

03:46.375 --> 03:51.108
<i>...for what you have added to
my long and happy life.</i>

03:51.280 --> 03:54.044
<i>Most of all, my mother.</i>

03:54.650 --> 03:58.746
<i>Mother, I always knew
you would outlive me.</i>

03:58.921 --> 04:00.616
<i>I loved you.</i>

04:01.823 --> 04:02.847
<i>Prosit.</i>

04:17.039 --> 04:22.136
<i>Todd, Jan,
my smart and talented grandsons...</i>

04:22.311 --> 04:25.906
<i>...take good care of the restaurant.</i>

04:26.081 --> 04:28.743
<i>It is the last piece of your heritage.</i>

04:28.917 --> 04:34.150
<i>And don't worry,
someone will be watching over you.</i>

04:36.925 --> 04:37.914
<i>Popo!</i>

04:38.660 --> 04:41.993
<i>-Hey. It's Popo.
- Popo was given to me...</i>

04:42.531 --> 04:45.830
<i>...by my father on his deathbed.</i>

04:46.268 --> 04:47.257
<i>Prosit!</i>

04:57.746 --> 05:00.840
<i>And finally, to me.</i>

05:01.383 --> 05:02.907
<i>Looking good down there.</i>

05:18.900 --> 05:21.391
<i>Say good night, Popo.</i>

05:21.636 --> 05:23.968
<i>Good night, Popo.</i>

05:30.579 --> 05:34.345
For hundreds of years,
it has been a Wolfhouse tradition...

05:34.516 --> 05:37.713
...to spread the ashes of
our loved ones in Munich.

05:37.886 --> 05:40.719
I am too old.
I want you boys to go to Germany...

05:40.889 --> 05:43.517
...and carry out this tradition
for your grandfather.

05:43.959 --> 05:46.655
Sure, it would be an honor for us,
Great Gam Gam. When?

05:46.828 --> 05:50.286
Well, you must leave immediately.

05:50.465 --> 05:53.366
The tradition is to spread the ashes...

05:53.535 --> 05:55.696
...during the festival
on the Theresienwiese.

05:55.871 --> 05:58.396
There you will meet
a Mr. Schniedelwichsen.

05:58.573 --> 06:01.235
He will take you to
the family resting place.

06:01.410 --> 06:04.140
The festival begins this week.

06:04.312 --> 06:05.745
The festival of the what-what?

06:05.914 --> 06:10.010
Oh, boys, you know this festival
as Oktoberfest.

06:10.185 --> 06:11.709
We're in.

07:17.719 --> 07:21.052
We really gotta find this Schniedelwichsen
and spread Grandpa's ashes.

07:21.223 --> 07:22.747
He's supposed to meet us here.

07:22.924 --> 07:26.155
So there's nothing we can do
but hang out and wait. Right, Grandpa?

07:45.680 --> 07:47.307
Come on, guys.

07:58.593 --> 08:00.424
Are you making fun of us, mate?

08:00.762 --> 08:01.751
What? No.

08:01.930 --> 08:04.626
We're singing the beloved
drinking songs of our country...

08:04.799 --> 08:06.790
...and you sing us
that bloody jingo jango?

08:07.769 --> 08:10.829
I reckon you're taking
the piss out of Oktoberfest.

08:11.006 --> 08:11.995
We're just singing.

08:12.174 --> 08:13.471
What do you think, mate?

08:13.642 --> 08:15.633
I think we should fucking brain them.

08:17.012 --> 08:18.172
Hey, we love Oktober--

08:36.664 --> 08:38.394
Hot cheese soup!

08:38.732 --> 08:40.030
Hot cheese so--!

08:52.714 --> 08:54.682
<i>Come on.
This is the Fr√§uleins Gone Wild!</i>

08:54.849 --> 08:57.317
<i>Just kiss each other, ja?</i>

09:18.006 --> 09:20.736
Helmut, my God, are you okay?

09:24.179 --> 09:26.374
Oh, strewth. They hit the little kid!

09:34.689 --> 09:36.122
Let's get the bastards!

09:55.577 --> 09:57.306
So this is Oktoberfest.

09:57.479 --> 09:58.639
Wolfhouse?

10:00.915 --> 10:01.904
Yeah.

10:04.753 --> 10:06.482
I am Mr. Schniedelwichsen.

10:07.255 --> 10:08.813
- Hi!
- Let's go.

10:08.990 --> 10:12.050
Gam Gam said you'd meet us here.
There's some crazy--

10:13.762 --> 10:15.286
- Gotcha.
- Hey!

10:15.463 --> 10:17.055
- He's got me!
- He's gone crazy dingo.

10:19.801 --> 10:21.826
Make fast! Make very fast!

10:22.003 --> 10:22.992
Split! Split!

10:33.381 --> 10:35.315
Where are we going,
Mr. Spiedelspackel?

10:35.483 --> 10:37.781
Schniedelwichsen. Come.

10:37.952 --> 10:40.079
Halt. See, we're here.

10:44.225 --> 10:45.385
Johan?

10:45.560 --> 10:47.687
The ashes.
We left them back at that tent.

10:47.862 --> 10:49.830
We gotta go get our grandfather's ashes.

10:53.768 --> 10:55.929
Come. Come now.

11:20.895 --> 11:22.362
We in the right neighborhood?

11:28.503 --> 11:30.869
Oh, hello, blondie.

11:31.039 --> 11:32.506
You care for a dance?

11:33.308 --> 11:35.401
Jan? Jan?

11:36.277 --> 11:38.507
Leave my brother alone.

11:40.181 --> 11:41.671
I miss you!

11:54.262 --> 11:55.524
The password!

12:50.418 --> 12:52.613
<i>Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink!</i>

13:02.964 --> 13:05.057
They're playing Quarters!

13:06.334 --> 13:07.323
Hey, Beer Pong!

13:09.637 --> 13:12.071
Upside-down Chugs!

13:12.941 --> 13:15.375
Come! Come in here.

13:22.350 --> 13:26.150
I'd bugger her
for a game of soldiers, huh?

13:27.288 --> 13:31.281
Hello. Pim Scutney.
This here's me mate, Rog Gobshire.

13:31.459 --> 13:32.619
Team England.

13:32.794 --> 13:36.025
I am Jan Wolfhouse and
this is my brother, Todd Wolfhouse.

13:36.197 --> 13:38.825
And what is this?

13:39.000 --> 13:42.458
Beerfest, innit!

13:42.704 --> 13:44.137
Is this part of Oktoberfest?

13:44.305 --> 13:47.763
Oktoberfest is for tossers and
sheep-shaggers.

13:47.942 --> 13:49.876
Beerfest is our lives.

13:50.044 --> 13:54.276
The ultimate test of
a beer-gamer's mettle!

13:54.516 --> 13:55.983
- Where's the American team?
- Yeah.

13:57.852 --> 13:59.786
- That's worth a squirt, innit?
- What?

14:03.525 --> 14:04.514
Excuse me, guys.

14:04.692 --> 14:08.219
Please vomit in proper receptacles!

14:08.396 --> 14:11.490
Wait a second.
Look at those urns over there.

14:11.666 --> 14:13.133
They look just like Grandpa's.

14:13.902 --> 14:16.530
That's why Schniedelwasher
brought us here.

14:16.704 --> 14:19.264
We're supposed to put Grandpa's urn
up there with those.

14:19.440 --> 14:20.998
We gotta go back and get it.

14:21.175 --> 14:23.575
You go. I'm never leaving this place.

14:23.745 --> 14:28.512
<i>Das Boot! Das Boot! Das Boot! Das Boot!</i>

14:33.855 --> 14:35.015
Hello, guvnor!

14:35.189 --> 14:36.986
We got ourselves a tie.

14:37.158 --> 14:38.819
You see them blokes in the knickers?

14:38.993 --> 14:41.052
That's the German team, the champs.

14:41.229 --> 14:44.562
Their family owns
the oldest brewery in Bavaria.

14:44.732 --> 14:47.166
They're regular diamond geezers,
they are, right?

14:47.335 --> 14:49.997
Why does the last guy
chug out of a shoe?

14:50.171 --> 14:52.401
That's no shoe!

14:52.574 --> 14:55.407
That's Das Boot!

14:56.377 --> 14:58.868
And she's a cruel old mistress, she is.

15:04.886 --> 15:06.683
Drink up, Hansel!

15:08.890 --> 15:10.517
Wow, they're fast!

15:15.363 --> 15:16.352
Das Boot!

15:22.203 --> 15:24.262
<i>Das Boot! Das Boot!</i>

15:43.291 --> 15:44.553
Schniedelspanker!

15:58.573 --> 16:01.804
Von Wolfhausen. Wolfhouse.

16:02.410 --> 16:04.401
Your last name's von Wolfhausen?

16:05.446 --> 16:08.176
Get the fuck out of here. So is ours!
Wolfhouse.

16:10.251 --> 16:13.277
We're cousins?
Oh, this just gets better and better!

16:13.888 --> 16:17.324
We must be related through
our grandfather, Johan von Wolfhausen.

16:31.072 --> 16:33.040
Why are you taking him?
Where's he going?

16:33.207 --> 16:35.903
We kind of need to stick close.

16:36.978 --> 16:41.881
- He is of no concern to you.
- But he was just walking us through. He--

16:42.850 --> 16:46.581
You do not speak of Beerfest
outside of Beerfest!

16:47.055 --> 16:49.046
You do not bring outsiders to Beerfest.

16:49.223 --> 16:51.350
But our grandfather
was Johan von Wolf--

16:52.093 --> 16:53.993
Your grandfather
was no von Wolfhausen.

16:54.162 --> 16:57.325
Your grandfather was a thieving
bastard stable boy.

16:58.032 --> 17:00.660
- What did you say?
- Baron Ludwig von Wolfhausen...

17:00.835 --> 17:04.703
<i>...our great-grandfather, the most
legendary brewmeister in all Deutschland.</i>

17:04.872 --> 17:07.363
He perfected the von Wolfhausen
beer recipe.

17:07.541 --> 17:11.342
It was the greatest beer in all the world.

17:11.913 --> 17:15.609
When Ludwig died, your grandfather stole
the only copy of the recipe created.

17:15.782 --> 17:18.479
Hold on a second.
Our grandfather didn't brew beer.

17:18.653 --> 17:21.451
He had this little sausage house
in Colorado. He couldn't--

17:21.622 --> 17:23.089
<i>He could und he did.</i>

17:23.424 --> 17:27.484
<i>He stole our recipe und fled Germany
with his mother...</i>

17:27.662 --> 17:30.426
...a common Bavarian....

17:31.432 --> 17:35.061
What's the English word I'm looking for?

17:35.236 --> 17:36.225
Whore.

17:36.804 --> 17:38.669
Gam Gam a whore?

17:39.006 --> 17:41.099
Obviously there's
a translation problem here.

17:41.275 --> 17:43.243
Hooker. Prostitute. Slut for money.

17:43.411 --> 17:46.869
- Now you're crossing the line.
- No, you are crossing the line! He stole it!

17:47.048 --> 17:51.382
<i>Und now, instead of having Deutschland's
greatest beer, we merely have fourth-best.</i>

17:59.127 --> 18:01.357
<i>Ja, we are not your cousins.</i>

18:01.529 --> 18:05.522
You are the offspring of the bastard son
of some whore!

18:08.269 --> 18:10.999
- Don't call Gam Gam a whore! She's not!
- Punch me! Do it!

18:11.172 --> 18:13.538
<i>Ja, you big tough guy.
Kill me, come on.</i>

18:13.708 --> 18:16.541
Do it now! Kill me.
What are you waiting for?

18:17.111 --> 18:21.309
Typical Americans. This is why
we don't allow you in our Beerfest.

18:21.482 --> 18:24.315
<i>You get a few drinks in you
und you become the Dirty Harry.</i>

18:24.485 --> 18:28.080
You should go back to your strip malls
and drink your Zimas and Smirnoff Ices.

18:28.256 --> 18:30.884
<i>Und then you can punch each other silly.</i>

18:32.059 --> 18:34.084
Okay. Okay.

18:34.262 --> 18:37.789
Okay. Sounds like you guys
fancy yourselves drinkers, huh?

18:38.232 --> 18:40.996
<i>Ja, maybe a little.
I think we just beat the Irish, so....</i>

18:41.169 --> 18:44.536
- Oh, that's good. The champions. What?
- Well, I'll tell you what.

18:44.705 --> 18:48.505
Why don't you pick your best two?
Because you just opened up a can of corn.

18:49.243 --> 18:50.540
Corn.

18:51.546 --> 18:54.538
We are laughing.
We are laughing at you.

18:54.715 --> 18:57.206
- Our best two? You want our best two?
- The corn.

18:57.385 --> 19:00.752
How about our worst two, right?
Hammacher! Schlemmer!

19:22.443 --> 19:25.173
You take the big guy.
I'll get the little one.

19:26.380 --> 19:28.974
<i>You ready, du kleiner Hosenschei√üer?</i>

19:30.718 --> 19:34.620
Everyone at once.
First team to finish wins. On my word.

19:34.789 --> 19:37.587
<i>-Let's do this.
- Ja, do it.</i>

19:46.400 --> 19:50.962
Hey, boys, why don't you let us
put a nipple on that for you?

19:52.506 --> 19:54.940
I remember my first beer.

19:56.644 --> 19:57.770
Prosit.

20:44.725 --> 20:47.660
Allow me to introduce our grandfather:

20:47.828 --> 20:50.592
Wolfgang von Wolfhausen.

20:50.765 --> 20:52.357
Take a good look...

20:52.533 --> 20:55.730
...for this is a real von Wolfhausen.

20:55.903 --> 20:57.666
Grandpapa.

21:02.443 --> 21:03.637
Oh, shit.

21:05.379 --> 21:08.871
So you are the progeny of Johan.

21:09.650 --> 21:13.746
I am guessing that he is the one
who taught you how to drink beer.

21:15.022 --> 21:16.683
Now...

21:17.558 --> 21:19.788
...where is our recipe?

21:20.261 --> 21:23.162
What fucking recipe?

21:33.541 --> 21:34.940
Friends...

21:35.910 --> 21:39.869
...this is all that remains
of a thieving stable boy...

21:40.047 --> 21:44.177
...who ran away to America
with his whore mother!

21:55.296 --> 21:59.323
I'm a sucker for family reunions.

22:01.869 --> 22:03.359
Here are a couple of euros.

22:04.005 --> 22:09.238
Go back and get a BJ
from your great-grandma, on me.

22:09.944 --> 22:11.741
Now get out of here.

22:11.912 --> 22:15.177
<i>BJ! BJ! BJ! BJ! BJ! BJ!</i>

22:43.844 --> 22:46.312
They called Grandpa a thief
and Gam Gam a whore!

22:46.480 --> 22:49.472
We gotta go back.
We gotta go back and beat those guys.

22:49.650 --> 22:53.381
- Oh, come on, man, that's crazy.
- Is it? We can do this.

22:53.554 --> 22:55.215
We can do what?

22:55.389 --> 22:56.583
Great Gam Gam.

22:56.757 --> 22:59.157
<i>Mein boys. Oh, willkommen.</i>

23:03.097 --> 23:04.928
Honey, what happened to your eye?

23:05.666 --> 23:08.692
I accidentally walked into a wall.
Yeah, the Berlin Wall.

23:08.869 --> 23:11.099
I'll tell Tippy to get
some cold pig stomach.

23:11.272 --> 23:12.671
We put that on Janny's eye.

23:13.240 --> 23:17.643
So tell me,
was the ceremony beautiful?

23:18.646 --> 23:23.174
Yeah. Very beautiful. I mean, gorgeous.

23:23.350 --> 23:25.341
Was it a peaceful resting place?

23:26.487 --> 23:28.921
Have you ever been
to the family resting place?

23:29.090 --> 23:32.457
No, but I've been told it is wonderful.

23:32.793 --> 23:34.761
- Quiet, lovely.
- Yeah.

23:35.396 --> 23:37.159
And how is Herr Schniedelwichsen?

23:37.731 --> 23:39.665
- Oh, he's fine. Great guy.
- Yeah. Good.

23:39.834 --> 23:41.301
He says hi.

23:43.237 --> 23:47.003
Oh, you boys have done a great thing.

23:47.174 --> 23:50.701
Now your grandpapa can rest in peace.

23:56.383 --> 23:57.907
She couldn't be more not a whore.

23:58.085 --> 23:59.450
We're gonna defend her honor.

23:59.620 --> 24:01.212
We're gonna defend Grandpa's honor!

24:01.388 --> 24:03.788
- We're gonna put together our own team!
- Yes.

24:03.958 --> 24:07.359
We'll get the biggest drinkers, the best
beer-gamers, the fastest chuggers.

24:07.661 --> 24:10.528
Then we're gonna go back
and kick the tar out of those Krauts!

24:10.698 --> 24:13.292
That's my brother!
God, I missed you.

24:13.467 --> 24:14.900
Beerfest it is.

24:15.569 --> 24:16.558
They want a war?

24:16.737 --> 24:18.728
We'll give them a war
they won't believe.

24:25.446 --> 24:26.674
So how'd you find him?

24:26.847 --> 24:29.372
Some dude, used to work
with him at the brewery.

24:29.550 --> 24:31.541
Haven't seen him since
Hands Across America.

24:31.719 --> 24:32.879
Oh, that's right.

24:33.053 --> 24:37.490
I heard that when the brewery gave
him his pink slip, he killed a guy.

24:37.658 --> 24:39.489
I heard that too.

24:40.728 --> 24:41.752
There he is.

24:43.831 --> 24:46.561
You got nothing, baby.
I got everything!

24:47.935 --> 24:50.495
You got nothing! You got nothing!

25:04.418 --> 25:05.851
We're gonna win this thing.

25:09.590 --> 25:11.182
Can I have your autograph?

25:11.358 --> 25:12.450
Oh, no autographs, kids.

25:12.626 --> 25:14.719
No, no, no. Thanks anyway.
Get you next time.

25:14.895 --> 25:18.228
Hey, guys. Good job out there, Naka.

25:20.768 --> 25:23.293
Hey, Landfill! Hey, big guy!

25:23.470 --> 25:25.802
Hey, look what the cat dragged in!

25:25.973 --> 25:28.601
I haven't seen you guys since....
Hands Across America?

25:28.776 --> 25:29.936
We were just saying that.

25:30.110 --> 25:33.045
We almost made it.
Couple breaks in the chain, right?

25:36.784 --> 25:38.877
What's going on?
You disappeared for a while.

25:39.053 --> 25:40.953
We heard you got fired from the brewery.

25:43.857 --> 25:46.155
Goddamn brewery!

25:48.162 --> 25:49.959
They brew 10,000 bottles of beer a day.

25:50.130 --> 25:52.963
I drink 45 off the assembly line,
and I'm the asshole.

25:53.133 --> 25:55.624
Jim Tobleson said they called in
a hostage negotiator.

25:55.803 --> 25:57.737
Jim Tobleson's a fucking Chatty Cathy.

25:58.572 --> 26:00.540
I did my three years up at the county pen.

26:00.708 --> 26:04.269
Made some friends, went Muslim.
Now I'm out, praise Allah.

26:04.645 --> 26:07.637
I heard that someone died that day.

26:08.515 --> 26:10.642
Yeah, somebody did die that day.

26:12.953 --> 26:14.580
Me.

26:14.888 --> 26:19.154
I had the greatest job in the world,
brewing cold, fresh joy for thousands.

26:19.326 --> 26:21.920
Not to mention all the beer
you could drink, right?

26:22.730 --> 26:24.755
They took it away from me.

26:25.032 --> 26:28.058
Yep, I'd trade all this in if I could get
that feeling back again.

26:30.037 --> 26:31.629
What?

26:38.012 --> 26:39.001
There he is.

26:39.179 --> 26:40.703
Nathan Cornwell has discovered...

26:40.881 --> 26:43.941
...pneumono-ultra-microscopic-
silico-volcano-canaisis.

26:44.118 --> 26:45.517
Big round of applause, people.

26:47.621 --> 26:48.781
You want that geek?

26:49.623 --> 26:52.091
What's he gonna do, check my urine?

26:53.494 --> 26:55.462
I met Finkelstein back in college.

26:55.629 --> 26:57.358
He was a real brainiac, that nerd.

26:57.965 --> 27:00.456
Studied everything about everything.
Including beer.

27:00.768 --> 27:02.258
So shut the fuck up.

27:02.436 --> 27:04.529
What are you doing?
Put the frog on the table.

27:04.705 --> 27:07.037
Clean out the floxinator
or something, all right?

27:07.207 --> 27:10.142
People, listen up. Use your thumbs.

27:10.311 --> 27:14.179
Locate the seminal vesicle here,
the ejaculatory ducts here.

27:14.348 --> 27:17.579
Then stroke it.
Stroke it. Stroke it hard.

27:17.751 --> 27:20.015
Cup the gonads.
If you don't cup the gonads....

27:20.187 --> 27:21.381
Finky!

27:21.555 --> 27:24.524
Jan? Todd?
What are you guys doing here?

27:24.692 --> 27:27.422
- Hey, smart coat.
- Oh, thank you. It's rayon.

27:30.331 --> 27:31.923
What are you doing?

27:32.099 --> 27:34.465
We're extracting frog gamete
for cloning trials.

27:34.802 --> 27:36.326
You're jerking him off.

27:37.071 --> 27:38.732
- Who's the hippo?
- Phil Krundel.

27:39.206 --> 27:40.571
The name's Landfill.

27:41.108 --> 27:43.508
Listen, Fink.
We're putting together a drinking team.

27:43.677 --> 27:46.168
There's a competition
and we want you to be part of it.

27:48.015 --> 27:50.108
- Come on. I'm really busy.
- We're serious.

27:50.751 --> 27:54.187
You don't understand. I'm a respected
member of the scientific community.

27:55.289 --> 27:56.278
Sorry.

27:56.457 --> 27:59.255
- We can't do it without you, Fink.
- No chance. I have a job.

27:59.426 --> 28:02.827
I've got a house with a pool
and a two-car garage. I got three Ph.D.s.

28:02.996 --> 28:04.657
Hey! Don't do that!

28:04.832 --> 28:06.800
- I'm published in four journals.
- What?

28:06.967 --> 28:07.956
<i>Toad Load Weekly?</i>

28:08.135 --> 28:11.627
We need you, Fink.
America needs you.

28:11.805 --> 28:13.796
That sounds a little dramatic.

28:13.974 --> 28:17.501
That's the part we haven't told you.
We're competing against the Germans.

28:22.082 --> 28:23.344
Germans?

28:23.517 --> 28:26.975
Yeah. Big, blond, asshole Germans.

28:33.193 --> 28:34.785
You got 15 minutes to tell me more.

28:40.667 --> 28:43.966
- Can you move over, please?
- I like to sit in the middle.

28:44.138 --> 28:45.571
What am I supposed to do?

28:45.739 --> 28:47.536
You have room. You're little.

28:47.708 --> 28:50.302
- You wanna sit on this side?
- Fuck you.

28:52.246 --> 28:53.873
Jan, who are we meeting out here?

28:56.250 --> 28:59.811
- Jan, who are we meeting out here?
- Barry Badrinath.

29:00.821 --> 29:03.415
- What? No.
- Who's Barry Badrinath?

29:03.590 --> 29:05.387
- I'm putting a team together.
- Turn around.

29:05.559 --> 29:07.151
- Who's Barry?
- Don't worry.

29:07.327 --> 29:09.727
Who's Barry Badrinath?
Who's Barry Badrinath?

29:09.897 --> 29:12.229
Will you shut the hell up? Shut up.

29:12.399 --> 29:14.594
Barry Badrinath was the
best beer-gamer ever.

29:14.768 --> 29:16.998
Best at Quarters, at Pong,
best at everything.

29:19.406 --> 29:20.930
We should put him on our team.

29:21.308 --> 29:23.708
Well, actually, Barry and Todd
had a falling-out.

29:23.877 --> 29:26.243
- See, Barry doinked Todd's girlfriend.
- Yahtzee.

29:26.413 --> 29:27.437
- Zip it, Fink.
- Sorry.

29:27.614 --> 29:29.878
Just think about Gam Gam
for a minute, all right?

29:30.684 --> 29:33.585
- Is this guy really that good?
- Yeah.

29:33.854 --> 29:35.583
He's the best.

29:37.024 --> 29:38.889
We should put him on our team, then.

29:44.531 --> 29:47.398
- There he is.
- Where?

29:47.568 --> 29:48.762
Right there.

29:48.936 --> 29:49.925
Oh, my God.

29:50.103 --> 29:51.434
What happened to him?

29:51.939 --> 29:55.204
All right. It's a regular
hot-dog cart in here, huh?

29:56.276 --> 29:57.709
All right, here's how it works.

29:57.878 --> 30:00.540
One dollar to look at it.
Two dollars to touch it.

30:00.714 --> 30:03.012
Three dollars to watch me touch it.

30:03.183 --> 30:04.844
That's lots of nice-looking manhood.

30:05.018 --> 30:06.576
Back the fuck up, Antonio!

30:06.753 --> 30:08.414
My dick!

30:09.289 --> 30:10.756
My apologies.

30:10.924 --> 30:12.892
Five to touch it
while I touch my toes.

30:13.060 --> 30:15.824
Six dollars to touch it
while I touch your toe--

30:17.231 --> 30:20.223
Oh, hey, Jan. How are you?

30:24.738 --> 30:27.730
Todd. And Fink.

30:27.908 --> 30:30.138
- Hey, looking good, Finky.
- You too, Barry.

30:30.310 --> 30:33.973
I wish I could give you a deal here,
but my pimp's a real ball ache, you know?

30:34.915 --> 30:39.579
So it's $10 for a BJ,
$12 for an HJ, $15 for a ZJ.

30:39.753 --> 30:40.845
What's a ZJ?

30:41.021 --> 30:43.785
If you have to ask, big man,
you can't afford it.

30:43.957 --> 30:45.857
I got $4.

30:46.026 --> 30:48.756
Barry, we didn't come here for a BJ...

30:48.929 --> 30:52.262
...or a ZJ or any kind of a J.

30:53.834 --> 30:55.631
Move along, then.
I got a mouth to feed.

30:56.470 --> 30:57.494
Barry, wait.

30:58.372 --> 31:00.306
Jan, hold on.
That's not such a good idea.

31:00.474 --> 31:01.839
Barry!

31:02.276 --> 31:04.369
There's this big beer-games competition.

31:04.545 --> 31:05.944
We're putting a team together.

31:06.813 --> 31:08.781
- We want you.
- Twenty-five bucks.

31:08.949 --> 31:12.385
No, no, no. You'd be training
with us over the next year.

31:13.020 --> 31:15.716
- Thirty bucks?
- Jan, forget it.

31:15.889 --> 31:19.723
No, just show us some of
the old coin tricks. Come on.

31:22.362 --> 31:24.523
Oh, please, Jan, let's get out of here.

31:24.698 --> 31:26.222
- No. Wait.
- No?

31:26.633 --> 31:28.362
Clearly, you've fallen on hard times.

31:28.535 --> 31:31.197
This would be a chance
to get back to the glory days.

31:31.371 --> 31:34.363
It's a chance to show you still got it.
You still got it, right?

31:36.743 --> 31:38.142
You bet your ass I do.

31:38.312 --> 31:39.643
Show them.

31:42.382 --> 31:43.849
Watch and learn, baby diapers.

31:44.017 --> 31:45.348
Just like college.

31:57.698 --> 32:00.861
It's nothing to worry about.
He's shaking the cobwebs off.

32:01.034 --> 32:02.968
I got it. I got it.

32:03.837 --> 32:05.566
All right, here we go.

32:05.739 --> 32:07.536
- A little sticky on the:
- Yeah.

32:08.875 --> 32:10.843
- This guy blows.
- Come on. You can do it.

32:11.945 --> 32:13.378
Glasses, maybe. I....

32:19.820 --> 32:20.912
What are you looking at?

32:21.288 --> 32:22.619
Barry, what happened to you?

32:25.626 --> 32:27.389
Get out of here! Get out of here!

32:28.929 --> 32:30.590
- Get out of here!
- Barry, Barry--

32:31.665 --> 32:33.860
- Get out of here!
- Help! Help!

32:35.869 --> 32:38.337
So, what about
Dan "The Magic Man" Dunchkowski?

32:38.505 --> 32:40.268
He'd down a beer ball
with every meal.

32:40.440 --> 32:42.908
He's no good.
He had that Al Roker surgery.

32:43.076 --> 32:44.168
He went black?

32:44.344 --> 32:46.539
Don't be a moron.
He got his stomach stapled.

32:46.713 --> 32:49.443
Most he can fit are two Triscuits
and a glass of water.

32:49.616 --> 32:50.981
Really?

32:52.386 --> 32:53.546
Oh, boy.

32:54.755 --> 32:56.985
Wolfhouses, I want on the team.

32:57.157 --> 33:00.320
Forget about it. You're done.
You don't have any more, Badrinath.

33:00.494 --> 33:02.018
Oh, yeah?

33:14.675 --> 33:16.142
He's got a gun!

33:32.793 --> 33:33.987
Unbelievable!

33:34.361 --> 33:35.521
That's incredible.

33:36.496 --> 33:37.861
I'm better when I'm drunk.

33:38.031 --> 33:40.261
- I'll say.
- Of course. So is everybody.

33:41.902 --> 33:44.598
Hey. Looks like we got ourselves a team!

33:44.771 --> 33:47.035
- Get them in there.
- All right!

33:50.510 --> 33:53.536
Well, boys, if we're gonna train...

33:53.980 --> 33:57.472
...we're gonna need a training facility!

34:01.655 --> 34:03.850
It's perfect!

34:04.491 --> 34:05.822
It's amazing!

34:05.992 --> 34:08.960
Look at the size of this
graduated cylinder: 2000 milliliters!

34:09.129 --> 34:10.527
A direct-draw beer dispenser.

34:11.531 --> 34:14.193
Half-barrel capacity,
with an anti-foaming mechanism.

34:14.367 --> 34:15.697
These are really the coins?

34:16.036 --> 34:19.972
Hey. I think I found us
a creepy new mascot.

34:22.842 --> 34:24.811
Yeah, fuck it.
Yeah, give it a rim job.

34:24.978 --> 34:26.809
Don't. That belonged to our grandpa.

34:28.614 --> 34:30.206
Sorry.

34:31.717 --> 34:32.810
Listen up, fellas.

34:33.420 --> 34:35.388
The next 11 months
are gonna be tough.

34:35.554 --> 34:37.716
As tough as anything you've ever done.

34:37.891 --> 34:41.520
We're gonna drink beer.
And a lot of it.

34:42.529 --> 34:44.053
If anybody here isn't up to it...

34:44.231 --> 34:47.098
...l'm gonna give you one last chance
to walk out that door.

34:50.737 --> 34:53.864
- That's a good one, Todd.
- Good. That's what I wanted to hear.

34:54.040 --> 34:58.636
Because in this silver slice of
heaven here are 1984 ounces of beer.

34:58.812 --> 35:00.245
Golden, delicious beer.

35:00.413 --> 35:03.541
And no one leaves here until we finish
every single last drop.

35:03.717 --> 35:05.617
All right, let's have the keys.

35:07.721 --> 35:10.519
- All you guys. You too, big boy.
- Don't lose these.

35:11.224 --> 35:13.215
All right, Fink, hit me.

35:14.094 --> 35:15.857
Sorry. I'm a mathlete, not an athlete.

35:16.897 --> 35:20.389
Hey, Barry, how about
a little warm-up match?

35:21.802 --> 35:24.532
Good one. But I'll leave
the practicing to the amateurs.

35:28.842 --> 35:32.369
All right, guys, let's focus, huh?
Huddle up.

35:32.546 --> 35:34.070
All right!

35:35.549 --> 35:38.211
Guys, those Germans
are incredible drinkers.

35:38.618 --> 35:40.643
Better than anything I've ever seen.

35:40.821 --> 35:43.449
Now, Fink, they've got
this thing called The Boot.

35:43.623 --> 35:46.319
There's a secret way to drink it.
I don't know what it is.

35:46.493 --> 35:49.462
- You'll have to figure that out for us.
- You got it, Hot Toddy.

35:49.629 --> 35:52.029
One more thing,
I cannot stress this enough, people.

35:52.199 --> 35:56.727
This is a super-secret competition.
You cannot tell anybody about this.

35:56.903 --> 35:58.063
Or else what?

35:58.238 --> 36:00.638
The guy that brought us there,
they killed him.

36:04.377 --> 36:07.505
But let's not worry about that now.

36:09.282 --> 36:11.216
- Let's drink some beer!
- Yeah!

36:11.384 --> 36:14.080
- All right!
- Yeah, cheers!

36:20.994 --> 36:22.188
Ice cold.

36:22.362 --> 36:23.795
- Anyone else's cold?
- Really cold.

36:23.964 --> 36:27.525
Drinking and dancing at the same time.
That's what's making it tough.

36:27.701 --> 36:29.794
Thought there might be a bug in there.

36:29.970 --> 36:33.167
My teeth hurt, it's so cold.
That's what makes me have to stop a bit.

36:33.340 --> 36:35.808
- How many beers in this thing?
- About 125 beers, yeah.

36:35.976 --> 36:37.671
A hundred and twenty-five?

36:37.844 --> 36:39.675
Might have a cavity here.

36:41.114 --> 36:43.446
- You're dead, bitch.
- Oh, yeah?

36:44.618 --> 36:47.781
Remember we made Fudgsicles out
of shit and Mark DeFanti ate one?

36:50.190 --> 36:51.179
Eight points.

36:54.327 --> 36:56.693
These big ones have
a different flight pattern.

36:57.530 --> 36:59.464
Nobody said it was gonna be easy.

37:00.300 --> 37:02.200
That shiner's sure starting to fade, huh?

37:02.369 --> 37:04.030
Yeah, I kind of wish it wouldn't.

37:04.204 --> 37:06.638
It's great motivation.
A reminder of the humiliation.

37:06.806 --> 37:08.831
I wouldn't mind having it
while training.

37:09.876 --> 37:11.537
Okay.

37:19.152 --> 37:21.177
You are a good friend.

37:21.354 --> 37:23.754
All right, here we go.

37:27.193 --> 37:28.820
Oh, yeah.

37:28.995 --> 37:30.929
I know you love it, Muscle Lips.
Let's go.

37:31.097 --> 37:33.258
Lap it up, you hungry son of a bitch.

37:34.200 --> 37:35.258
Sorry.

37:35.602 --> 37:37.900
Get a handle on your Frisbee, college boy.

37:38.071 --> 37:41.563
<i>Don't go there. You do not sully a yarmulke,
you goyim schmendrik miskayt.</i>

37:41.741 --> 37:44.073
I don't know why you're here.
You can't drink beer.

37:44.244 --> 37:46.405
I'll show you how to drink
a beer, motherfucker.

37:46.579 --> 37:47.603
Fucking man cow.

37:52.252 --> 37:54.516
Hey, I think somebody's trying
to chug in my face!

37:54.688 --> 37:55.746
Look out, Germans!

37:55.922 --> 37:57.287
<i>You got chutzpah, Fuckelstein.</i>

38:02.128 --> 38:04.153
- That's great.
- Hey, Todd.

38:04.331 --> 38:07.596
About the old girlfriend thing.
Can we bury the hatchet, buddy?

38:08.935 --> 38:11.733
- I don't know.
- It was just a one-night stand, right?

38:12.372 --> 38:14.966
Wasn't even that good-looking.
Real dead fish, right?

38:15.976 --> 38:20.345
I mean, she just laid there, taking it
like a plastic fuck doll, am I right?

38:22.315 --> 38:25.079
I happen to have married
that plastic fuck doll!

38:25.251 --> 38:26.582
Todd, no!

38:27.454 --> 38:29.854
Hey! Get off him!

38:32.692 --> 38:34.319
Someone's chewing my leg!

38:49.175 --> 38:51.735
I hate you, Badrinath!

39:02.522 --> 39:06.891
Oh, my God. Phil. Phil, honey.

39:07.060 --> 39:08.925
Oh, my God.

39:10.563 --> 39:11.655
Hello? Yes.

39:11.831 --> 39:14.959
We need an ambulance immediately
at 622 Francis Drive.

39:17.337 --> 39:19.430
Come on, Phil.
Stay with me, honey.

39:25.311 --> 39:27.711
Oh, my God, what is that?

39:27.881 --> 39:29.473
Ham.

39:30.216 --> 39:31.205
Phil?

39:52.238 --> 39:54.604
Not again.

40:21.701 --> 40:22.690
How'd we do?

40:25.371 --> 40:26.599
Not good.

40:29.576 --> 40:34.104
If we're gonna drink like the Germans,
I think we're gonna need a little help.

40:34.581 --> 40:36.071
You don't have to yell.

40:37.584 --> 40:40.451
Don't say anything to Great Gam Gam
about the competition.

40:40.887 --> 40:42.479
Don't talk about her being a whore.

40:42.655 --> 40:44.418
- She's a whore?
- No, she's not a whore.

40:44.591 --> 40:46.786
- So what if she was a whore?
- She's not.

40:46.960 --> 40:49.394
I'm just saying, some of
my best friends are whores.

40:49.562 --> 40:50.756
Yeah, we know.

40:52.532 --> 40:55.092
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Wolfhouse.

40:56.569 --> 40:58.434
- Can I help you?
- Who are you?

40:58.738 --> 40:59.932
My name's Cherry.

41:00.106 --> 41:02.802
- Is everything okay?
- Everything is fine.

41:02.976 --> 41:04.637
Great Gam Gam.

41:04.811 --> 41:09.305
Cherry is here to help me
now that my Johan is gone.

41:10.783 --> 41:13.149
<i>Mein darling great-grandboys...</i>

41:13.319 --> 41:15.879
<i>...und their delicious-looking friends.</i>

41:16.055 --> 41:18.023
Come in.

41:22.595 --> 41:24.995
And summer sausage.

41:25.165 --> 41:27.065
Just came out of the refrigerator.

41:27.233 --> 41:31.226
Here, try this. Oh, no, wait.
Here, let me warm it up for you.

41:43.283 --> 41:44.580
No, that's fine. We're okay.

41:44.751 --> 41:49.085
When we were at Oktoberfest, we noticed
that the Germans were excellent drinkers.

41:49.255 --> 41:52.486
- Oh, yeah, that is true. That is a true thing.
- How do they get good?

41:52.659 --> 41:54.957
Well, from the time
that they are little kids...

41:55.128 --> 41:57.756
...Germans are raised
to be excellent beer drinkers.

41:57.931 --> 42:00.365
- How?
- Well, for one thing...

42:00.533 --> 42:03.001
...they train high up in the Alps.

42:03.169 --> 42:07.572
Interesting. High-altitude training.
Similar to the Kenyan marathon runners.

42:07.740 --> 42:11.369
They are also taught to relax
the muscles of the throat.

42:11.544 --> 42:14.012
Germans can pretty much
stick anything down there.

42:14.180 --> 42:18.810
I myself can probably fit in at least....
Oh, at least nine inches.

42:19.285 --> 42:22.777
- Here, let me show you.
- No. You don't have to demonstrate.

42:22.956 --> 42:24.389
What else do the Germans do?

42:24.557 --> 42:28.516
They also practice by drinking
the urine of a ram.

42:29.028 --> 42:31.019
- The what?
- They drink ram's piss.

42:31.197 --> 42:33.062
- Because of the pH balance?
- No.

42:33.233 --> 42:38.193
Because if you can drink ram's piss,
fuck, you can drink almost anything.

42:39.272 --> 42:42.207
- She said "fuck."
- Gam, who's drinking piss, honey?

42:42.375 --> 42:46.004
No, I was saying it was a tradition
back in the old country.

42:46.312 --> 42:49.179
Damn, that's nasty. The old country
must have been fucked up.

42:49.349 --> 42:51.317
Now, come on, baby,
it's time for your nap.

42:51.484 --> 42:53.452
- Come on.
- Okay. Well....

42:53.620 --> 42:55.053
See you boys later.

42:56.289 --> 43:00.282
I always sleep better
when I have a little sausage in me.

43:07.033 --> 43:08.660
Look, if you ask me...

43:08.835 --> 43:11.929
...l'd have to say the whole whore thing
is a real possibility.

43:12.105 --> 43:16.041
Bavarians have been warming
sausages like that for hundreds of years.

43:16.209 --> 43:18.336
Would you say
it's their oldest profession?

43:18.511 --> 43:19.535
Shut up, Landfill.

43:19.712 --> 43:22.647
All right, but more importantly,
where are we gonna find a ram?

43:38.498 --> 43:40.625
I'm gonna fucking puke.

43:41.801 --> 43:44.292
That's the most
disgusting thing I've ever drank.

43:44.470 --> 43:45.801
I doubt that, playboy.

43:48.341 --> 43:50.070
Oh, God, is there anything better?

43:50.376 --> 43:51.502
Not right now.

43:54.314 --> 43:57.078
You know, fellas,
maybe training alone on a rooftop...

43:57.250 --> 43:59.741
...drinking ram piss isn't the way to go.

43:59.919 --> 44:03.514
Maybe we should get out there and
mix it up with some randoms, you know?

44:03.690 --> 44:06.090
- Smart idea, college boy.
- Go test our mettle.

44:06.259 --> 44:08.591
Yeah, challenge somebody.
Challenge ourselves.

44:08.795 --> 44:09.989
Let's get bombed!

44:10.163 --> 44:11.755
Yeah!

44:35.555 --> 44:38.991
<i>Hey. Who ordered
the Queer Eye makeover?</i>

44:55.541 --> 44:57.736
We're the party brigade.

44:57.910 --> 45:00.037
We're here to play
some drinking games.

45:06.185 --> 45:07.982
Drink. You're rowing on the wrong side.

45:08.154 --> 45:09.314
You've gotta drink.

45:09.522 --> 45:10.819
I've got one.

45:10.990 --> 45:13.049
I never made out with Tommy Mullarky.

45:18.097 --> 45:21.430
My turn. I never fooled around
with Coach Gerber.

45:32.178 --> 45:34.078
This one's called the Strikeout.

45:34.247 --> 45:36.477
What you're gonna do is take a hit...

45:36.649 --> 45:39.777
...chug your beer, do a shot,
then blow out the smoke.

45:39.952 --> 45:41.783
Here goes nothing.

45:45.758 --> 45:48.192
Careful, dude. It's gonna fuck you up.

46:06.279 --> 46:09.373
That's not bad at all.

46:10.616 --> 46:11.640
"Strikeout," right?

46:13.820 --> 46:15.412
That's nothing.

46:16.389 --> 46:17.856
Don't...

46:18.658 --> 46:21.183
...really, however, see what...

46:21.461 --> 46:22.689
...all the...

46:23.029 --> 46:24.496
...fuss is about.

46:25.698 --> 46:29.156
- Oh, yeah. Way to go Dr. Finklestein.
- Do I know you?

46:29.335 --> 46:32.065
- Yeah. It's me, Jerry, your paperboy.
- Hey, Jerry.

46:33.206 --> 46:38.041
While I have you here, you forgot
my Sunday supplement last week.

47:11.511 --> 47:14.344
Wake up, Finky. Wake up.

47:15.281 --> 47:17.579
Cops, cops, cops!

47:30.029 --> 47:32.463
Dude, aren't you like 40?

47:36.068 --> 47:37.695
I'm 33.

47:45.478 --> 47:47.309
Hey, what the hell?

47:47.813 --> 47:48.802
Help!

47:50.983 --> 47:53.349
What a great morning.

48:11.637 --> 48:12.626
Night, ladies.

48:12.805 --> 48:14.136
- Night, Todd.
- Bye, Todd.

48:14.540 --> 48:15.973
Say hi to the missus.

48:16.142 --> 48:17.507
All right, guys, come on.

48:17.677 --> 48:20.009
- One, two, three.
- Go.

48:21.414 --> 48:23.211
My glasses!

48:25.618 --> 48:27.051
Two, three, go.

48:31.924 --> 48:33.721
Maybe we'll move to mugs tomorrow.

48:33.893 --> 48:35.155
He's so strict.

48:35.328 --> 48:36.454
Hey, Finky...

48:36.629 --> 48:38.995
- ...how you doing with The Boot?
- Not there yet.

48:39.165 --> 48:42.328
I have figured out the problem,
I just don't know the solution yet.

48:42.501 --> 48:43.661
Check this out.

48:43.836 --> 48:46.828
Hey, fellas, gather up.

48:51.010 --> 48:52.034
Here's the thing.

48:52.211 --> 48:57.148
When you drink, the shape of the boot
causes an air bubble to form in the toe.

48:57.316 --> 48:58.305
The bubble.

48:58.484 --> 49:00.475
This air bubble
shoots around the heel...

49:00.653 --> 49:03.121
...and explodes towards your face
while drinking.

49:03.289 --> 49:05.723
In your face, it explodes.

49:05.891 --> 49:08.655
- It's impossible to handle.
- It's impossible to handle.

49:08.828 --> 49:10.887
It's unavoidable.
The Germans know how.

49:11.063 --> 49:14.191
I find the whole thing frustrating
because I can't figure it out.

49:14.367 --> 49:16.096
It's frustrating.

49:16.268 --> 49:17.735
It's frustrating.

49:17.903 --> 49:19.598
It's frustrating.

49:19.772 --> 49:22.104
It's frustrating. It's frustrat--

49:22.274 --> 49:23.866
Can you get the puppet off of me?!

49:24.343 --> 49:26.937
- Hey, it's Popo.
- Sorry.

49:27.113 --> 49:28.341
You knocked his head off.

49:28.514 --> 49:30.448
Wait, wait. There's something in there.

49:31.150 --> 49:32.549
Hey, what is that?

49:34.520 --> 49:36.818
- Looks like it's German.
- Aren't you guys German?

49:37.323 --> 49:38.722
- Yeah, so?
- Give me that.

49:39.325 --> 49:42.021
I used to work
on a German cruise ship.

49:47.033 --> 49:48.330
Yeah, it's a beer recipe.

49:48.501 --> 49:50.662
- Really?
- What recipe?

49:51.337 --> 49:52.998
Must be the old German beer recipe.

49:53.172 --> 49:56.664
Those Germans said our grandfather
stole their family recipe.

49:56.842 --> 49:59.310
- lf he had it, why didn't he brew it?
- Hebrew?

49:59.478 --> 50:02.345
- Maybe he didn't know it was in here.
- It supposed to be good?

50:02.515 --> 50:06.611
If this is the recipe, this used to be
Germany's greatest beer.

50:09.622 --> 50:11.214
Okay, we want three cups.

50:11.390 --> 50:12.448
That's right. Good.

50:12.625 --> 50:14.616
Pour it on in, pour it on in.

50:14.794 --> 50:16.625
Okay, good. Let's have a little....

50:36.682 --> 50:38.673
- How is it, Jan?
- Tell us.

50:38.851 --> 50:39.943
It's....

50:40.119 --> 50:41.950
It's beautiful.

50:49.028 --> 50:50.791
- It's magical.
- It's laughing at me.

50:50.963 --> 50:52.760
I wish I could brush my teeth with it.

50:52.932 --> 50:55.162
- I wanna put my dick in it.
- I want it to put its dick in me.

50:55.334 --> 50:58.303
I wish it were winter, we could
make it into ice and skate on it.

50:58.471 --> 51:00.564
Then melt it in the springtime
and drink it.

51:02.875 --> 51:04.900
Hey, what's the matter, Jan?

51:08.147 --> 51:10.877
This means Gam Gam
really was a whore.

51:23.295 --> 51:24.455
It is good, it is good.

51:28.267 --> 51:30.098
I can't serve it fast enough.

51:30.269 --> 51:33.102
- Hey, buddy.
- Go with God.

51:33.272 --> 51:35.638
Hey, Wolfie. Give me a Schnitz.

51:37.610 --> 51:39.544
- Nice bottle.
- Hey, Landfill.

51:42.448 --> 51:44.439
Look at this guy! He's getting better.

51:46.552 --> 51:48.679
Dude, you want a Schnitz?

51:49.355 --> 51:51.482
Do you want a tip with that?

51:52.758 --> 51:53.918
Yeah.

51:54.226 --> 51:55.250
Good one.

51:55.528 --> 51:57.758
- Give me six Schnitzes.
- What the doctor ordered.

52:04.870 --> 52:06.735
Drink, drink, drink!

52:17.950 --> 52:19.884
Good, good, good.

52:23.289 --> 52:24.449
Special delivery!

52:25.291 --> 52:27.486
I have this special delivery
for Herr Baron.

52:27.660 --> 52:29.150
Can't you see we are training?

52:29.595 --> 52:32.860
<i>I am so sorry, but this package
comes all the way from America, ja...</i>

52:33.032 --> 52:35.865
...and look, it is marked:
"Most urgent."

52:56.989 --> 52:58.081
What is it, Grandpapa?

53:03.162 --> 53:04.561
They have the recipe.

53:06.866 --> 53:09.334
- Who else knows of this package?
- Absolutely no one.

53:09.501 --> 53:10.661
Only me. It's just me.

53:10.836 --> 53:12.360
- Dispose of him.
- Wait!

53:12.705 --> 53:15.367
No, no, no! What about
"Don't shoot the messenger," right?

53:15.541 --> 53:17.372
We're not going to shoot you.

53:17.543 --> 53:20.011
Boys, prepare your things.

53:20.212 --> 53:21.338
We are going to America.

53:23.782 --> 53:26.910
To get our recipe!

53:27.920 --> 53:31.321
<i>Hasta la vista, messenger boy.</i>

53:34.059 --> 53:36.254
<i>Up your nose mit the rubber hose!</i>

53:41.667 --> 53:45.728
I don't really have a move
except this one.

53:45.905 --> 53:47.463
Are you out?

53:47.640 --> 53:48.937
Finish your beer, asshole.

53:50.576 --> 53:51.565
<i>Asshole!</i>

53:51.744 --> 53:53.439
<i>Asshole! Asshole! Asshole!</i>

53:56.615 --> 53:58.480
Eat that tomato in one bite, asshole.

53:59.251 --> 54:02.652
<i>Asshole! Asshole! Asshole!</i>

54:05.557 --> 54:07.457
- Good job, asshole.
- Oh, no.

54:07.626 --> 54:09.059
- Where you going?
- Get out of here.

54:09.611 --> 54:11.545
Watch out. He's coming your way.

54:11.713 --> 54:13.772
See you later, asshole.

54:14.282 --> 54:15.271
Hey, Jan.

54:17.519 --> 54:20.079
- You all right?
- That's a good shot.

54:20.588 --> 54:22.112
Like the love.

54:30.231 --> 54:31.858
Yeah.

54:40.675 --> 54:42.643
Looking good, Barry.

54:44.012 --> 54:47.470
Looking good,
you handsome motherfucker.

55:03.598 --> 55:06.761
We gotta get you out of those
wet clothes and into a dry martini.

55:06.935 --> 55:09.699
- What?
- I said, "Out of the martini?"

55:09.871 --> 55:12.772
- Get away from me.
- All right.

55:43.304 --> 55:44.999
Two shots, please.

55:45.173 --> 55:47.607
How about a little Sex on the Beach?

55:48.076 --> 55:50.101
I think my place is closer.

55:52.147 --> 55:55.446
- You wanna get out of here?
- You looking for a little slap and tickle?

55:55.617 --> 55:57.744
Oh, yeah. Something like that.

56:00.555 --> 56:02.352
I'm gonna go grab a taxi, baby.

56:02.524 --> 56:04.116
Okay.

56:06.227 --> 56:08.491
- Yeah?
- Barry, what are you doing?

56:08.663 --> 56:10.893
You kidding me? She's hot as hell.

56:11.065 --> 56:13.226
I'm looking for
a little slap and pickle.

56:13.401 --> 56:15.266
You sure you wanna do this?
You're drunk.

56:15.437 --> 56:19.806
I'm drunk. You're drunk.
Everybody's drunk!

56:24.179 --> 56:25.510
Hi, Daddy.

56:25.680 --> 56:27.307
Hey, Mama.

56:31.986 --> 56:34.454
Damn, that's nasty.

56:38.827 --> 56:40.124
Come here.

56:41.663 --> 56:43.858
I'm gonna butter your bread, baby.

56:44.032 --> 56:46.762
Nice and toasty, please.

57:19.534 --> 57:23.698
- You wanna get out of here?
- Looking for a little slap and tickle?

57:23.938 --> 57:24.962
Something like that.

57:30.445 --> 57:32.675
I think I dropped my monkey.

57:37.519 --> 57:41.216
How many licks does it take
to get to the center.

57:42.023 --> 57:45.151
I'm gonna rock your world.

57:45.360 --> 57:47.453
I am going to break your dick off.

57:48.196 --> 57:50.061
Suck them.

57:50.431 --> 57:52.399
Lick them clean, Daddy.

57:52.567 --> 57:53.829
Suck them. Suck them.

57:54.002 --> 57:55.936
Lick them clean. Yes!

57:56.104 --> 57:57.628
Suck them! Suck them!

57:58.339 --> 58:00.136
Now, don't peek.

58:02.210 --> 58:03.199
Quit squirming!

58:08.917 --> 58:10.851
Oh, Daddy.

58:11.019 --> 58:14.819
Oh, you dirty motherfucker, right there.

58:25.797 --> 58:26.991
Come on.

58:27.165 --> 58:29.827
I knew it the whole time.

58:47.118 --> 58:49.018
I'm better than you!

59:04.368 --> 59:06.165
Somebody had the pig snouts over here?

59:06.337 --> 59:08.498
Who ordered the pig snouts?

59:28.359 --> 59:29.690
Gentlemen...

59:30.027 --> 59:33.622
...it appears it is time to initiate
Operation Recipe Retrieve.

59:39.237 --> 59:40.864
Is that the title we all agreed on?

59:41.038 --> 59:44.235
I kind of like Operation Stein Grab.

59:44.408 --> 59:46.273
Or what about Brauheist 2006?

59:46.444 --> 59:48.469
- Oh, that's a good one.
- It's kind of spunky.

59:48.646 --> 59:50.944
<i>-Ja, it's fun.
- One second.</i>

59:51.115 --> 59:55.711
<i>-What if it takes longer than a year?
- Ja, I was hoping to be done by 2007.</i>

59:55.887 --> 59:57.718
That's true. I have big plans for 2007.

59:57.889 --> 01:00:01.882
<i>Ja, we should take a vote, because
I never liked Recipe Retrieve either.</i>

01:00:03.161 --> 01:00:04.253
This is not a democracy.

01:00:05.196 --> 01:00:07.528
We always waste so much time
arguing about names.

01:00:07.698 --> 01:00:09.131
I'm sick of it.

01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:12.736
I came up with Operation Recipe Retrieve,
and that's the name!

01:00:12.904 --> 01:00:15.634
- Okay, fine.
- I like it now.

01:00:17.175 --> 01:00:18.938
I'm sorry.

01:00:19.544 --> 01:00:22.638
It's just that I start to feel
so cooped up in these U-boats.

01:00:22.813 --> 01:00:24.280
I had a bad experience once.

01:00:26.117 --> 01:00:27.345
Thank you.

01:00:27.885 --> 01:00:30.479
Now, let's go get what belongs to us.

01:00:32.323 --> 01:00:33.585
Battle stations.

01:00:38.696 --> 01:00:41.665
<i>Landfill! Landfill! Landfill!</i>

01:00:41.832 --> 01:00:44.096
Watch out. Okay, here comes
the bubble. Get ready.

01:00:46.971 --> 01:00:48.802
Damn it! It's the bubble!

01:00:48.973 --> 01:00:51.237
I know. No, it's a bitch.
Don't worry. Come on.

01:00:51.409 --> 01:00:53.001
You're getting better. Next time.

01:00:53.177 --> 01:00:54.166
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Krista.

01:00:54.345 --> 01:00:56.336
- Can I try that?
- Honey, we're practicing.

01:00:56.514 --> 01:00:58.709
- Hey, fill her up, okay?
- Practicing for what?

01:01:00.551 --> 01:01:01.745
- Nothing.
- No, seriously.

01:01:01.919 --> 01:01:04.513
You said you were practicing.
Practicing for what?

01:01:07.391 --> 01:01:11.157
Hey, honey, let's go take a look
at the glockenspiels.

01:01:11.329 --> 01:01:14.389
No, I don't wanna look
at the goddamn glockenspiels.

01:01:14.565 --> 01:01:16.795
- They're really shiny. Come on.
- I don't wanna.

01:01:18.336 --> 01:01:21.237
Well, hello, Dirty Harrys!

01:01:21.405 --> 01:01:23.134
Holy cameltoe.

01:01:23.307 --> 01:01:24.899
<i>Ja, the last time we saw you...</i>

01:01:25.076 --> 01:01:28.443
...you were wearing
your grandfather's ashes as a hat.

01:01:29.146 --> 01:01:31.341
You have one minute
to march out that door.

01:01:31.515 --> 01:01:33.210
We have come for our recipe.

01:01:33.384 --> 01:01:34.646
That's our recipe.

01:01:34.819 --> 01:01:36.548
We figured you would say that.

01:01:38.122 --> 01:01:42.525
Despite your thievery, we are prepared
to buy it from you, right now...

01:01:42.727 --> 01:01:44.092
...in cash.

01:01:44.262 --> 01:01:47.231
Big deal.
A suitcase full of Monopoly money?

01:01:47.398 --> 01:01:48.797
Come on, those are euros.

01:01:48.966 --> 01:01:52.129
What's that, like pesos?
Yeah! Come on.

01:01:52.303 --> 01:01:54.032
That is legal European tender.

01:01:54.205 --> 01:01:56.105
We should have brought deutsche marks!

01:01:56.274 --> 01:01:58.333
- But they are so hard to find!
- They're not!

01:01:58.509 --> 01:02:00.477
No, there's five ATMs.

01:02:00.645 --> 01:02:03.113
No, there's a Quickie Mart
right around the corner.

01:02:08.085 --> 01:02:09.109
Enough!

01:02:12.757 --> 01:02:16.955
Here is 500,000 American dollars.

01:02:17.128 --> 01:02:18.425
It's not for sale.

01:02:20.364 --> 01:02:24.198
Well, why don't we make it interesting?

01:02:24.368 --> 01:02:27.531
You seem like sporting fellows, no?

01:02:34.512 --> 01:02:37.276
I am so sorry. I'm really sorry.

01:02:37.448 --> 01:02:39.473
How about a match?

01:02:39.650 --> 01:02:43.416
<i>You win, you keep the recipe
und the money.</i>

01:02:43.954 --> 01:02:45.478
We win...

01:02:45.656 --> 01:02:47.749
- ...the recipe is ours.
- Give me that thing.

01:02:48.993 --> 01:02:51.826
All right, Barry. It's showtime.

01:02:51.996 --> 01:02:56.228
Yeah, there's something
I haven't quite told you yet.

01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:57.765
I don't play Pong anymore.

01:02:58.069 --> 01:03:02.005
What are you talking about, man?
You're the best. Here, let's go.

01:03:05.176 --> 01:03:08.168
- Come on. Let's go kick their ass.
- I don't fucking play Pong!

01:03:08.346 --> 01:03:10.041
Jesus, calm down.

01:03:10.214 --> 01:03:12.614
Pull it together.
You're acting a little crazy here.

01:03:12.783 --> 01:03:16.719
Your wife didn't think I was crazy when
I double-teamed her with "Silo" Johnson.

01:03:16.921 --> 01:03:18.411
- The double-team.
- The double-team.

01:03:18.589 --> 01:03:21.524
Yeah, that's right.
Never knew it was a three-way, did you?

01:03:21.692 --> 01:03:24.217
- With the Silo?
- Yeah.

01:03:24.428 --> 01:03:25.759
Let me tell you something:

01:03:25.930 --> 01:03:28.490
- He wasn't storing corn in that thing.
- Son of a bitch!

01:03:30.267 --> 01:03:32.531
Fuck it! I quit.

01:03:32.703 --> 01:03:34.762
What? Barry!

01:03:37.975 --> 01:03:39.306
The fuck is that?

01:03:40.144 --> 01:03:41.304
Are we playing or not?

01:03:41.479 --> 01:03:43.504
<i>Time to schei√üe or get off the crapper.</i>

01:03:43.681 --> 01:03:46.514
Get bent, umlaut. We're gonna sell
the shit out of this beer.

01:03:46.684 --> 01:03:51.018
You are making a big mistake, cowboy.

01:03:51.222 --> 01:03:54.885
Don't think you have seen the last of us.

01:04:00.798 --> 01:04:01.856
Oh, I forgot the money.

01:04:06.604 --> 01:04:08.834
You should get a pinball machine
that works.

01:04:09.006 --> 01:04:10.371
That machine works just fine.

01:04:10.541 --> 01:04:12.304
Does it?

01:04:26.557 --> 01:04:28.354
Folks, I'm sorry. Finish your meals.

01:04:28.526 --> 01:04:31.222
Enjoy. Let's-- Come on,
let's have some polka, all right?

01:04:36.267 --> 01:04:39.498
- Fuck.
- Hey.

01:04:41.972 --> 01:04:46.568
- You know we should have played them.
- I wasn't about to give them that recipe.

01:04:47.244 --> 01:04:49.769
- What do you wanna do about Barry?
- We don't need him.

01:04:49.947 --> 01:04:51.505
We can get someone else.

01:04:52.683 --> 01:04:54.310
What's that?

01:04:55.186 --> 01:04:56.744
<i>Local family restaurant...</i>

01:04:56.921 --> 01:05:00.118
<i>-That's us.
- ...or disease-infested rat hole?</i>

01:05:00.291 --> 01:05:04.625
<i>Expos√© Colorado has this exclusive
interview with former kitchen workers...</i>

01:05:04.795 --> 01:05:08.196
<i>...who will tell a story that will curdle
your strudel.</i>

01:05:08.365 --> 01:05:09.457
What the fuck?

01:05:09.633 --> 01:05:14.900
<i>We were undocumented aliens smuggled off
in a cargo container to work in the kitchen.</i>

01:05:15.072 --> 01:05:17.006
You gotta be kidding me.

01:05:17.174 --> 01:05:20.337
<i>It's very common for German restaurants
to use immigrant labor.</i>

01:05:20.511 --> 01:05:21.910
<i>It's true, Sandy.</i>

01:05:22.079 --> 01:05:23.706
<i>Tell us about the work conditions.</i>

01:05:23.881 --> 01:05:26.645
<i>The biggest surprise,
other than the oppressive hours...</i>

01:05:26.817 --> 01:05:28.409
<i>...was the unsanitary conditions.</i>

01:05:28.586 --> 01:05:31.453
<i>Yeah. Last month my finger was cut off
with the cake mixer.</i>

01:05:31.622 --> 01:05:34.557
<i>When my finger fell into the cake batter,
they didn't even stop.</i>

01:05:34.725 --> 01:05:37.285
<i>-They just kept making the cupcakes.
- Dear Lord.</i>

01:05:37.461 --> 01:05:41.557
<i>And the rats-- Just yesterday I opened up
a bottle of Schnitzelgeigerbr√§u...</i>

01:05:41.732 --> 01:05:45.395
<i>...and guess what I found?
A rat fetus inside.</i>

01:05:46.403 --> 01:05:48.166
<i>-It's true, Sandy.
- Rat fetus?</i>

01:05:48.339 --> 01:05:50.239
<i>-Oh, my God.
- Goddamn it!</i>

01:05:50.407 --> 01:05:52.272
Now we really gotta kick
those guys' asses.

01:05:52.443 --> 01:05:54.172
Absolutely.

01:05:54.345 --> 01:05:56.040
Schnitzengiggle Tavern.

01:05:56.514 --> 01:05:58.914
No, no. It was totally false.
It was a joke.

01:06:01.085 --> 01:06:02.882
Yeah, I understand.

01:06:04.455 --> 01:06:06.548
Canceled reservation.

01:06:07.525 --> 01:06:09.083
Schnitzengiggle.

01:06:09.693 --> 01:06:11.957
No, no, no. No rats. No rats at all.

01:06:12.129 --> 01:06:14.290
We've been rat-free since 1976.

01:06:16.367 --> 01:06:17.766
I promise--

01:06:18.802 --> 01:06:20.326
All right, no problem.

01:06:20.504 --> 01:06:21.801
- Another one?
- Yeah.

01:06:22.973 --> 01:06:24.440
Schnitzengiggle.

01:06:25.509 --> 01:06:27.807
No, I'm very happy
with my long-distance service.

01:06:29.113 --> 01:06:31.581
Yes. This is a really bad time. Thanks.

01:06:31.749 --> 01:06:34.217
God. Solicitors.

01:06:35.052 --> 01:06:36.883
Take this one.

01:06:38.188 --> 01:06:40.122
Schnitzengiggle Tavern.

01:06:40.724 --> 01:06:43.090
- It's the health board.
- Hang up. Hang up.

01:06:44.061 --> 01:06:46.586
- Give me this.
- Put that in the cooler.

01:06:51.702 --> 01:06:52.999
Guys...

01:06:53.170 --> 01:06:55.297
...l'm really sorry...

01:06:55.472 --> 01:06:58.236
- ...but I gotta quit the team.
- What are you talking about?

01:06:58.409 --> 01:07:01.071
I got fired from the lab
due to slipping performance.

01:07:01.245 --> 01:07:03.770
So a couple of frogs didn't get
their around-the-world.

01:07:03.948 --> 01:07:05.609
No, you don't understand.

01:07:05.783 --> 01:07:07.978
I don't know how it happened,
but somehow...

01:07:08.152 --> 01:07:11.417
...I cloned a batch of monkey-frogs.

01:07:11.589 --> 01:07:13.921
Don't they hand out
Nobel Prizes for that?

01:07:14.091 --> 01:07:15.251
Let me see that.

01:07:15.593 --> 01:07:17.527
Let me see you little....

01:07:17.695 --> 01:07:20.129
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God!

01:07:20.297 --> 01:07:21.628
What have you done?

01:07:26.437 --> 01:07:27.426
Landfill?

01:07:34.278 --> 01:07:35.540
What's wrong?

01:07:35.713 --> 01:07:39.911
Krista said she couldn't handle
all the lies and the drinking anymore.

01:07:40.084 --> 01:07:41.642
She took the kids and left.

01:07:41.819 --> 01:07:43.309
Oh, my God.

01:07:43.487 --> 01:07:45.114
You've got kids?

01:07:48.592 --> 01:07:51.220
It's okay. It's okay. I'm okay.

01:07:51.395 --> 01:07:53.693
I just need some time.

01:07:53.931 --> 01:07:56.456
- Maybe a beer.
- Get him a beer.

01:07:57.868 --> 01:07:59.495
Thank you.

01:08:04.408 --> 01:08:05.739
Did you know he had kids?

01:08:37.508 --> 01:08:40.477
Schwarzemaiden to Iron Eagle.
Come in, Iron Eagle.

01:08:40.644 --> 01:08:42.202
Iron Eagle, are you there?

01:08:42.379 --> 01:08:44.370
Mission accomplished.

01:08:44.814 --> 01:08:47.682
Mission accomplished. I got it.

01:08:47.850 --> 01:08:49.910
I got it.

01:08:53.957 --> 01:08:55.424
Cherry?

01:08:56.827 --> 01:08:58.920
Hey. Okay, now.

01:08:59.363 --> 01:09:02.093
- Don't be rash, Phillip.
- How did they get to you?

01:09:02.265 --> 01:09:06.497
I was in the employ of the von Wolfhausen
family long before I came to this stinkhole.

01:09:06.670 --> 01:09:09.434
And now that I have
your precious beer recipe, I can go.

01:09:09.606 --> 01:09:12.904
Well, you're gonna have to
get through me first.

01:09:23.087 --> 01:09:24.076
What?

01:09:57.755 --> 01:09:59.347
Yeah, girlfriend!

01:10:02.760 --> 01:10:03.784
Come on!

01:10:08.732 --> 01:10:10.996
Yeah!

01:10:24.681 --> 01:10:28.777
Feel that pulling you down?
That's the yeast, baby.

01:10:30.287 --> 01:10:31.879
It's like quicksand.

01:10:32.055 --> 01:10:34.148
Say goodbye.

01:11:08.759 --> 01:11:10.454
Love you.

01:11:12.396 --> 01:11:14.489
Hey, Landfill, where are you, buddy?

01:11:14.665 --> 01:11:16.758
Why don't we have a beer
and talk about it?

01:11:16.934 --> 01:11:18.367
Lan--

01:11:25.509 --> 01:11:27.602
No!

01:11:47.564 --> 01:11:51.000
That's it. We're packing it in.

01:11:51.168 --> 01:11:52.692
What, the team?

01:11:52.870 --> 01:11:55.304
The team, the beer, the restaurant.
All of it.

01:11:55.472 --> 01:12:00.102
- What? No, you're crazy--
- Jan. Let it go.

01:12:00.410 --> 01:12:02.571
Our friend is dead.

01:12:03.313 --> 01:12:05.178
It's over.

01:12:47.891 --> 01:12:51.486
Landfill could eat a ton.

01:12:52.696 --> 01:12:56.689
But he could also love a ton.

01:12:59.569 --> 01:13:03.505
He had this habit
of swallowing his food whole.

01:13:04.274 --> 01:13:06.435
I called him "The Tiger Shark."

01:13:06.610 --> 01:13:09.909
I used to joke
that if you cut open his belly...

01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:14.813
...you would find a license plate
and a tire and half of an 8-year-old boy.

01:13:16.653 --> 01:13:20.817
One time, he farted an entire plum.

01:13:25.829 --> 01:13:28.627
I was plumb surprised.

01:13:30.133 --> 01:13:33.500
I always told him
to try to chew his food better...

01:13:33.971 --> 01:13:36.337
...but he never listened to me.

01:13:38.008 --> 01:13:40.340
But that was Landfill.

01:13:40.510 --> 01:13:42.375
He was a fat asshole.

01:13:45.449 --> 01:13:47.144
But...

01:13:49.486 --> 01:13:52.512
...he was my fat asshole.

01:14:27.391 --> 01:14:30.519
- Hello.
- Hey, Laurie. How are you?

01:14:30.694 --> 01:14:33.356
- God, you're looking good.
- Thanks, Barry.

01:14:33.530 --> 01:14:36.465
Wow, what have you been up to?

01:14:37.467 --> 01:14:38.957
Me, l--

01:14:39.336 --> 01:14:44.364
- Working on bridges. Under bridges.
- Like an architect?

01:14:44.541 --> 01:14:46.338
Yeah. Yeah.

01:14:46.943 --> 01:14:51.573
- Still in contact with the Silo?
- The Silo.

01:14:56.586 --> 01:14:59.020
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

01:15:00.057 --> 01:15:01.285
Sorry. Hi.

01:15:01.892 --> 01:15:03.519
Good to see you.

01:15:04.528 --> 01:15:07.292
- Krista, I'm so sorry.
- Thank you. Thank you for coming.

01:15:07.464 --> 01:15:08.863
I appreciate it. Thank you.

01:15:09.032 --> 01:15:13.935
- Krista, I can't begin to tell you how sorry--
- You should be ashamed of yourself.

01:15:20.143 --> 01:15:21.474
Oh, my God.

01:15:22.879 --> 01:15:24.244
Oh, my God!

01:15:51.775 --> 01:15:54.335
Great Gam Gam.
What are you doing here?

01:15:54.511 --> 01:15:57.912
I too came to pay my respects
to a good man.

01:15:58.315 --> 01:16:02.877
But unlike you, I am not weeping.

01:16:03.053 --> 01:16:06.454
We're not weeping. We're mourning.
Our friend just committed suicide.

01:16:06.623 --> 01:16:08.921
- When were you going to tell me?
- Tell you what?

01:16:09.092 --> 01:16:11.526
That you are not competing in Beerfest.

01:16:13.130 --> 01:16:15.792
- How did you know about that?
- One death.

01:16:18.869 --> 01:16:21.770
- We should see if they got crab cakes left.
- Oh, great idea.

01:16:21.938 --> 01:16:23.371
Stay put, you.

01:16:24.474 --> 01:16:26.999
I want you all to hear the true story...

01:16:27.177 --> 01:16:30.476
...of the Baron Ludwig von Wolfhausen,
who fell in love...

01:16:30.647 --> 01:16:36.586
...with a beautiful young Bavarian whore.

01:16:36.753 --> 01:16:38.914
So you really were a whore?

01:16:39.089 --> 01:16:40.579
What do you think this is?

01:16:40.757 --> 01:16:43.419
You said you got kicked
in the face by a Clydesdale.

01:16:43.593 --> 01:16:45.458
This is the mark of the whore.

01:16:48.999 --> 01:16:52.560
<i>It was a simple time, a beautiful time.</i>

01:16:53.036 --> 01:16:57.905
<i>You see, the Baron Ludwig
and I were in love.</i>

01:17:02.846 --> 01:17:06.577
But we had to keep our love secret...

01:17:06.750 --> 01:17:10.811
...because he was married
to a young baroness.

01:17:10.987 --> 01:17:14.081
<i>We also had to keep
your grandfather's birth a secret...</i>

01:17:14.257 --> 01:17:17.249
<i>...because he was
the baron's first-born son.</i>

01:17:17.427 --> 01:17:19.987
<i>Wait, Grandpa was the first-born?</i>

01:17:20.163 --> 01:17:21.528
<i>Yes.</i>

01:17:21.698 --> 01:17:24.531
<i>But the baroness found out about it,
me and my young Johan...</i>

01:17:24.701 --> 01:17:28.637
<i>...and had us tarred and feathered
and run out of town.</i>

01:17:30.106 --> 01:17:33.507
You two are the rightful heirs
to the von Wolfhausen brewery.

01:17:33.677 --> 01:17:37.010
You should have the balls
to take back what is yours.

01:17:37.214 --> 01:17:38.772
Wow, you even talk like a whore.

01:17:39.616 --> 01:17:43.848
We are all whores in some way,
Mr. Finkelstein.

01:17:44.754 --> 01:17:45.846
She's right.

01:17:46.022 --> 01:17:49.549
<i>You boys are a team, und a good one.</i>

01:17:50.060 --> 01:17:54.759
If you can't do it for your grandfather
or your country or your dead friend...

01:17:55.031 --> 01:17:57.329
...do it for yourselves.

01:17:58.001 --> 01:17:59.662
- I'm in.
- Me too.

01:17:59.836 --> 01:18:01.701
- Hell, yeah! I'm in.
- Yeah!

01:18:01.871 --> 01:18:04.704
- Yeah!
- I can't do it.

01:18:06.476 --> 01:18:08.774
I can't play Pong.

01:18:10.847 --> 01:18:13.475
It happened a couple years after college.

01:18:14.484 --> 01:18:18.011
I was in Thailand,
playing Ping-Pong in Ding Dang.

01:18:19.990 --> 01:18:23.221
I was in a real high-stakes game
in some opium den.

01:18:24.027 --> 01:18:27.554
Turned out the guys I was playing
aren't the kind of guys who like to lose.

01:18:28.431 --> 01:18:30.399
After I beat them...

01:18:30.834 --> 01:18:32.768
...they beat me.

01:18:34.371 --> 01:18:36.805
Worked me over pretty good.

01:18:38.375 --> 01:18:41.503
And this is hard to say...

01:18:42.946 --> 01:18:45.039
...but they held me down...

01:18:46.983 --> 01:18:49.281
...and they shoved
a Ping-Pong paddle up my ass.

01:18:53.790 --> 01:18:56.054
It's never been the same.

01:18:57.394 --> 01:18:59.225
I'm damaged goods.

01:18:59.396 --> 01:19:00.727
Gosh, Barry, I'm so sorry.

01:19:00.897 --> 01:19:04.424
I don't know what I would do if somebody
shoved a paddle handle up my ass.

01:19:06.136 --> 01:19:07.433
Wasn't the handle.

01:19:10.874 --> 01:19:12.967
I've been shitting pancakes ever since.

01:19:15.445 --> 01:19:17.538
Mr. Badrinath...

01:19:17.981 --> 01:19:21.041
...we are not so different, you and I.

01:19:22.752 --> 01:19:25.152
I've had all kinds of things
shoved up my ass.

01:19:27.457 --> 01:19:29.755
I got over it.

01:19:30.060 --> 01:19:32.585
You will too.

01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:39.668
You will too.

01:19:49.579 --> 01:19:51.638
- So much to digest in there.
- Yeah.

01:19:51.815 --> 01:19:53.248
Calgon, take me away.

01:19:55.485 --> 01:19:57.612
You guys are my family.

01:19:57.987 --> 01:19:59.284
Without you, I got nothing.

01:20:03.593 --> 01:20:04.924
Let's do this for Landfill...

01:20:05.695 --> 01:20:07.390
...and for Johan...

01:20:07.564 --> 01:20:09.395
...and for Great Gam Gam.

01:20:17.273 --> 01:20:18.501
One question.

01:20:18.675 --> 01:20:20.973
Who we gonna get to replace Landfill?

01:20:22.612 --> 01:20:25.740
Now, this is the party
I was hoping to find.

01:20:26.683 --> 01:20:29.652
Landfill? You're alive?

01:20:31.321 --> 01:20:34.620
No, I'm not Landfill.

01:20:34.958 --> 01:20:38.325
I'm Landfill's twin brother, Gil.

01:20:38.495 --> 01:20:39.723
- Gil?
- Gil?

01:20:39.896 --> 01:20:43.332
I taught Landfill
everything he knew about drinking beer.

01:20:43.500 --> 01:20:46.492
I wanna fulfill his legacy
by taking his place on your team.

01:20:48.171 --> 01:20:50.731
- You must be Fink.
- How'd you know?

01:20:50.907 --> 01:20:52.704
Landfill told me everything about you.

01:20:52.876 --> 01:20:54.707
I feel like I know all you guys.

01:20:54.878 --> 01:20:57.608
So we won't have that awkward
get-to-know-each-other stage.

01:20:57.781 --> 01:21:00.306
- Perfect.
- And if I could just ask one favor.

01:21:00.483 --> 01:21:03.850
- Name it.
- lf it wouldn't be too uncomfortable...

01:21:04.020 --> 01:21:08.354
...I was hoping maybe you guys
could call me Landfill, in honor of him.

01:21:08.525 --> 01:21:10.152
- Yeah, sure, sure.
- Sure.

01:21:10.326 --> 01:21:12.055
It'd be like we never lost Landfill.

01:21:13.196 --> 01:21:14.788
Landfill...

01:21:14.964 --> 01:21:18.024
...it would be an honor
if you would join us.

01:21:23.506 --> 01:21:25.235
Cheers.

01:21:27.243 --> 01:21:29.302
Oh, my God, he's faster than Landfill.

01:21:44.661 --> 01:21:46.720
Oh, my God, what is that, bratwurst?

01:21:47.397 --> 01:21:51.060
- He even smells like Landfill.
- God, someone open a window, fast.

01:21:51.468 --> 01:21:52.730
Wait!

01:21:52.902 --> 01:21:57.430
- I wanna bask in it.
- Yeah, yeah. Just let it be.

01:21:58.575 --> 01:22:01.066
Welcome back, Landfill.

01:22:02.712 --> 01:22:05.374
Hey, let's go get sour on some Krauts.

01:22:05.548 --> 01:22:06.810
Yeah!

01:22:06.983 --> 01:22:09.543
- Yeah!
- Come on!

01:22:09.719 --> 01:22:11.778
Yeah!

01:22:58.501 --> 01:23:02.062
Landfill Two,
you are twice the man Landfill One was.

01:23:02.238 --> 01:23:04.433
Well, thank you, little lady.

01:23:05.375 --> 01:23:06.672
Yeah!

01:23:34.404 --> 01:23:35.701
Are we lost?

01:23:36.873 --> 01:23:40.274
The thing about it is, you know,
we were shit-faced when he took us there.

01:23:40.443 --> 01:23:42.377
- What?
- Really drunk.

01:23:42.545 --> 01:23:45.776
We been training for an entire year,
lost our jobs and our family...

01:23:45.949 --> 01:23:48.918
- ...and you don't know where this is?
- You haven't been training.

01:23:49.085 --> 01:23:51.553
- Can it, college boy!
- "College boy"? I thought you--

01:23:51.721 --> 01:23:56.215
- Hey, guys. Please, give it a rest.
- You know what? I got an idea.

01:23:56.392 --> 01:23:58.451
It might work. I did this study in college:

01:23:58.628 --> 01:24:01.688
Finkelstein's Theory on Effects of Alcohol
on the Temporal Lobes.

01:24:01.864 --> 01:24:03.695
- English.
- Drunken recall.

01:24:03.866 --> 01:24:08.064
I made people drink massive quantities, then
taught things while they were blacked out.

01:24:08.237 --> 01:24:10.637
Now, in the morning,
they had no recollection of it.

01:24:10.807 --> 01:24:13.332
But when I got them drunk again,
they remembered.

01:24:14.510 --> 01:24:16.273
- Bullshit.
- Now you're coming after me?

01:24:16.446 --> 01:24:19.210
Cowboy on one side,
Indian on the other. It's the Wild West.

01:24:19.716 --> 01:24:21.149
- I got it published.
- Where?

01:24:21.317 --> 01:24:25.344
<i>Maxim magazine, under the title
"E Equals MC Hammered."</i>

01:24:25.755 --> 01:24:28.747
- All right, let's do this.
- Which one of you two was more wasted?

01:24:28.925 --> 01:24:30.825
- He was.
- He was.

01:24:30.994 --> 01:24:34.088
All right, okay, I was.
I actually hadn't eaten much that day.

01:24:42.105 --> 01:24:43.163
Anything?

01:24:43.339 --> 01:24:46.274
Sorry. But I have been training
for a beer-drinking competition.

01:24:48.645 --> 01:24:50.340
Drink.

01:24:59.389 --> 01:25:02.552
- Sober as a bird.
- All right. Enough fucking around.

01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:06.094
Here. Try this.

01:25:37.694 --> 01:25:39.423
The password!

01:25:50.540 --> 01:25:54.271
- That was great.
- That was last year's password!

01:25:54.444 --> 01:25:55.433
Oh, come on.

01:25:55.611 --> 01:25:57.977
- That's cheap.
- Shit.

01:25:59.882 --> 01:26:01.907
I got an idea.

01:26:05.388 --> 01:26:06.878
The pa--!

01:26:50.066 --> 01:26:51.226
Silence.

01:26:54.937 --> 01:26:57.497
The old Trojan keg.

01:26:58.007 --> 01:26:59.907
Very clever for Americans.

01:27:00.243 --> 01:27:03.269
- Now get them out of here.
- Hang on, hang on, hang on.

01:27:04.680 --> 01:27:07.877
We're here to honor our grandfather,
Johan von Wolfhausen.

01:27:08.050 --> 01:27:10.177
The stableboy thief?

01:27:10.353 --> 01:27:12.082
No. Your half-brother.

01:27:12.455 --> 01:27:16.892
Your older half-brother and rightful heir
to the von Wolfhausen brewery.

01:27:17.059 --> 01:27:18.390
Oh, please.

01:27:18.561 --> 01:27:20.529
Johan wasn't even Ludwig's
true offspring.

01:27:20.696 --> 01:27:22.857
No?

01:27:25.668 --> 01:27:27.067
Look at the portrait.

01:27:28.437 --> 01:27:30.769
Not a true offspring?

01:27:30.940 --> 01:27:32.931
I'd say it looks pretty close to me, eh?

01:27:33.109 --> 01:27:35.441
You know the von Wolfhausen brewery
is our brewery.

01:27:35.611 --> 01:27:40.548
Even if your silly fairy tale was true,
we have a little saying in M√ºnchen.

01:27:40.716 --> 01:27:42.707
Get the fuck out of here.

01:27:42.885 --> 01:27:45.012
- Guards.
- Wait, wait!

01:27:45.621 --> 01:27:47.088
We came here to drink some beer.

01:27:47.523 --> 01:27:51.152
Are you gonna let us do that, or are you
afraid of getting your asses stomped?

01:27:51.994 --> 01:27:53.461
Let them drink!

01:27:53.629 --> 01:27:55.995
Yeah! Let them compete!

01:27:56.165 --> 01:27:57.757
<i>Let them drink!</i>

01:27:57.934 --> 01:27:59.094
<i>Let them drink!</i>

01:27:59.268 --> 01:28:00.496
<i>Let them drink!</i>

01:28:00.670 --> 01:28:01.762
<i>Let them drink!</i>

01:28:01.938 --> 01:28:04.133
Grandpapa, we've crushed them once.

01:28:04.307 --> 01:28:05.740
Let us do it again, huh?

01:28:05.908 --> 01:28:08.172
Let us humiliate them.

01:28:08.344 --> 01:28:09.777
Please, Opy, we can do this.

01:28:09.946 --> 01:28:11.743
- We can do it.
- Yeah.

01:28:11.914 --> 01:28:13.506
Okay.

01:28:13.683 --> 01:28:15.150
Why not? For shits and giggle.

01:28:15.318 --> 01:28:16.410
Let them drink!

01:29:05.968 --> 01:29:07.299
Beer drinkers...

01:29:07.970 --> 01:29:09.267
...welcome to Beerfest.

01:29:11.340 --> 01:29:13.968
- Yeah!
- Come on!

01:29:14.377 --> 01:29:16.641
You are the privileged few.

01:29:17.546 --> 01:29:19.241
We got the Brits in Round One.

01:29:20.583 --> 01:29:23.051
We already kicked their asses in WWll.

01:29:23.219 --> 01:29:25.210
Cheerio, let's do it again.

01:29:25.388 --> 01:29:28.050
Drink well. Drink with honor.

01:29:28.224 --> 01:29:29.851
Let the games begin.

01:29:32.662 --> 01:29:37.497
<i>Beerfest! Beerfest! Beerfest!</i>

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:41.401
First round is best of five.

01:29:41.570 --> 01:29:45.563
U.S.A. versus England.

01:29:45.741 --> 01:29:48.710
You're all fur coat
and no trousers, you are.

01:29:48.878 --> 01:29:51.039
- I'm sorry. One more time?
- Shove off!

01:29:51.213 --> 01:29:55.172
We're gonna put the skitters
in your Alan Whickers, you plonker!

01:29:55.651 --> 01:29:59.917
- Do you know what he's saying?
- Volume Chug!

01:30:01.357 --> 01:30:04.383
Come on, big boy.
What, are you gonna fucking cry?

01:30:04.560 --> 01:30:07.188
That's all you, Landfill. All you.

01:30:07.930 --> 01:30:09.488
Come on!

01:30:12.435 --> 01:30:15.666
Come on, motherfucker! It's time!

01:30:15.838 --> 01:30:20.002
Come on, baby. It's all you, buddy.
Drink it down.

01:31:44.493 --> 01:31:48.520
How about this? How about that?
How about:

01:31:48.697 --> 01:31:52.497
Now, how do I say this? The Mexican.

01:32:46.355 --> 01:32:50.815
Championship round,
Germany versus U.S.A.

01:33:01.036 --> 01:33:04.028
All right. This is what we came for,
the Germans!

01:33:04.206 --> 01:33:06.504
Yeah, the Germans!

01:33:09.278 --> 01:33:10.438
Oh, that's good.

01:33:10.613 --> 01:33:13.081
Oh, my God.

01:33:13.249 --> 01:33:15.046
Oh, my God.

01:33:15.217 --> 01:33:16.377
Oh, my God!

01:33:16.552 --> 01:33:17.541
What's up, Finky?

01:33:17.720 --> 01:33:20.188
I got it. Beating the boot.
It's so simple.

01:33:20.789 --> 01:33:25.317
It's all about fluid dynamics
and quantum bubblenautics. Follow?

01:33:25.895 --> 01:33:28.955
I missed that first part
when he said something.

01:33:29.131 --> 01:33:32.726
Pay attention. I'm only doing this once,
okay? Excuse me!

01:33:33.869 --> 01:33:35.302
Do me a favor, top me off.

01:33:36.472 --> 01:33:39.464
Thank you. Okay.

01:33:39.642 --> 01:33:42.543
Now, look. The bubble is essentially
a high-pressure vacuum...

01:33:42.711 --> 01:33:45.111
...that grows and grows
until it gets to the heel...

01:33:45.281 --> 01:33:47.681
...then it pops and explodes
out of the boot. Okay?

01:33:47.850 --> 01:33:50.478
So, what you wanna do
is create a spiral effect...

01:33:50.653 --> 01:33:52.780
...by spinning the boot
and making a whirlpool.

01:33:52.955 --> 01:33:55.617
When the bubble hits the corner,
gravity will take over...

01:33:55.791 --> 01:33:57.452
...and shoot beer down your throats.

01:33:57.626 --> 01:33:59.992
So, what you're saying is,
when the bubble comes...

01:34:00.162 --> 01:34:01.527
...just turn the boot.

01:34:01.697 --> 01:34:05.292
If we find ourselves in a
boot challenge, we can beat these guys.

01:34:06.168 --> 01:34:08.193
Way to go, Finky.

01:34:08.370 --> 01:34:11.635
All right.
Let's light this Kraut candle.

01:34:11.807 --> 01:34:13.638
Yeah!

01:34:15.311 --> 01:34:17.677
I'm still peeing! I'm still going!

01:34:22.518 --> 01:34:25.180
<i>We're gonna wipe our schwanz on you.</i>

01:34:25.354 --> 01:34:27.618
<i>Bring it on, meine bitch.</i>

01:34:27.790 --> 01:34:31.089
Championship round is best of seven.

01:34:31.260 --> 01:34:32.750
<i>Und jetzt...</i>

01:34:32.928 --> 01:34:38.059
...for the ultimate battle!

01:34:41.837 --> 01:34:45.830
<i>First up, long-distance kr√ºgerbounce.</i>

01:34:46.008 --> 01:34:49.967
Distance, 10 meters.

01:34:50.913 --> 01:34:52.437
What do you say, Barr?

01:34:52.615 --> 01:34:54.549
Watch and learn.

01:34:59.989 --> 01:35:02.787
Shaking your butt.

01:35:02.958 --> 01:35:06.359
Move the bucket 20 meters.

01:35:08.330 --> 01:35:09.319
Twenty meters!

01:35:09.498 --> 01:35:11.864
Twenty meters.
You're never gonna make it.

01:35:12.034 --> 01:35:13.160
Oh, yeah?

01:35:13.335 --> 01:35:15.496
Thirty meters.

01:35:15.671 --> 01:35:17.366
Thirty meters.

01:35:17.539 --> 01:35:20.064
Okay. Let's see it.

01:35:27.149 --> 01:35:28.138
Yeah!

01:35:40.896 --> 01:35:43.831
Germany, the winner!

01:35:45.034 --> 01:35:46.262
It's okay. It's okay.

01:36:01.016 --> 01:36:02.984
Yes!

01:36:06.388 --> 01:36:07.480
<i>U.S.A. sucks!</i>

01:36:07.790 --> 01:36:10.190
Germany, three.

01:36:10.359 --> 01:36:13.328
U.S.A., zero.

01:36:13.495 --> 01:36:18.728
If Germany wins, they are the champions!

01:36:23.072 --> 01:36:26.132
Hold. Hold on. Wait a minute.
Hold the phones.

01:36:26.308 --> 01:36:27.605
Herr Referee...

01:36:27.776 --> 01:36:30.836
...there is an American player
who has not competed in any event.

01:36:31.013 --> 01:36:33.880
And the rule says every competitor
must compete, otherwise...

01:36:34.049 --> 01:36:35.482
...disqualification.

01:36:35.651 --> 01:36:36.743
Hold on there, Hansel.

01:36:36.919 --> 01:36:38.614
That is the rule.

01:36:38.787 --> 01:36:41.017
Your fifth teammate must compete now.

01:36:41.190 --> 01:36:43.522
Are you talking about me?

01:36:49.765 --> 01:36:53.565
Jan, if we let him play, we're gonna
get slaughtered and it's over, kaput.

01:36:53.736 --> 01:36:55.465
You heard the guy.

01:36:55.637 --> 01:36:57.366
I'll play with him.

01:37:01.243 --> 01:37:02.267
Barry, are you sure?

01:37:03.045 --> 01:37:04.103
Sure as schnitzel.

01:37:11.487 --> 01:37:13.546
Hey, Barr-zo, I'm proud of you.

01:37:13.722 --> 01:37:15.349
Hey, thanks.

01:37:15.991 --> 01:37:19.984
Hey, Comrades, how about loser
takes a paddle up the ass?

01:37:21.029 --> 01:37:22.087
I like that.

01:37:23.799 --> 01:37:24.857
Volley for serve.

01:37:26.802 --> 01:37:29.293
You know you have to hit the ball.

01:37:33.008 --> 01:37:34.873
What do you think about that, fuckhead?

01:37:35.043 --> 01:37:37.534
Yeah, Barry, you got him. He's yours.

01:37:43.385 --> 01:37:46.479
What do you think about that, headfuck?

01:38:17.453 --> 01:38:19.011
Match point!

01:38:19.188 --> 01:38:20.780
Come on, we gotta win this one.

01:38:20.956 --> 01:38:23.550
You got nothing. Bring it.

01:38:25.894 --> 01:38:27.555
Jiminy.

01:38:29.665 --> 01:38:30.859
Come on, Barry.

01:38:57.192 --> 01:38:58.420
Wow, what a shot!

01:38:58.594 --> 01:39:02.030
Hey, Todd,
sorry about porking your wife, man.

01:39:02.197 --> 01:39:05.462
Hey, Barry,
you can pork my wife anytime.

01:39:10.405 --> 01:39:11.895
What's the name of the game?

01:39:12.074 --> 01:39:13.063
Thumper!

01:39:13.242 --> 01:39:14.732
And why do we play it?

01:39:14.910 --> 01:39:16.241
To get fucked up!

01:39:26.555 --> 01:39:28.489
No! No!

01:39:28.657 --> 01:39:32.320
No, I didn't! No, I did this!
No, I didn't! No, I didn't!

01:39:32.494 --> 01:39:34.394
Bullshit! I did the--

01:39:34.563 --> 01:39:37.623
Look at the scoreboard! Scoreboard!

01:39:49.511 --> 01:39:50.500
I'm burying you.

01:39:50.679 --> 01:39:52.169
You're not even close, girlie.

01:39:52.381 --> 01:39:53.575
Halt!

01:39:55.784 --> 01:39:58.617
You're worried now.
You're worried now, aren't you?

01:40:04.293 --> 01:40:06.989
Take that. Moment of truth.

01:40:07.162 --> 01:40:10.495
Germany, 224.

01:40:11.533 --> 01:40:13.023
That's good, that's good.

01:40:13.201 --> 01:40:14.930
U.S.A...

01:40:15.938 --> 01:40:18.805
...228.

01:40:27.549 --> 01:40:30.313
All tied up. Sudden death.

01:40:30.485 --> 01:40:33.283
You know what that means.

01:40:33.455 --> 01:40:36.447
Das Boot!

01:40:39.895 --> 01:40:41.226
<i>Das Boot! Das Boot!</i>

01:40:41.396 --> 01:40:43.660
<i>Das Boot! Das Boot! Das Boot!</i>

01:40:44.499 --> 01:40:46.797
Hey, guys, this is that moment.

01:40:46.969 --> 01:40:49.062
The moment that only exists in sports.

01:40:49.237 --> 01:40:51.637
The moment where the good guys
take on the bad guys.

01:40:51.807 --> 01:40:54.139
The moment that,
if this was a speech in a movie...

01:40:54.309 --> 01:40:56.436
...this would be shown
up on the humongotron...

01:40:56.612 --> 01:40:59.513
...to get the home-team fans
fired up, huh? Right?

01:40:59.681 --> 01:41:01.046
Us versus them!

01:41:01.216 --> 01:41:03.309
We're the bad guys
and they're the good guys.

01:41:03.485 --> 01:41:06.511
And I'll be damned
if we're gonna let the good guys win!

01:41:06.688 --> 01:41:11.819
Yeah, we're actually the good guys
and they're the bad guys, so....

01:41:11.994 --> 01:41:14.519
Right. Let me start that again,
guys, huh?

01:41:14.696 --> 01:41:16.186
Hey, guys, this is that moment--

01:41:16.365 --> 01:41:17.354
Fellas. Fellas.

01:41:17.532 --> 01:41:20.831
I just wanna say
thanks for the greatest year of my life.

01:41:21.003 --> 01:41:23.403
All right? And no matter what happens,
win or lose...

01:41:23.572 --> 01:41:26.473
...drinking beer with you guys
is just plain old-fashioned fun.

01:41:26.642 --> 01:41:28.303
Yeah. Yeah.

01:41:28.477 --> 01:41:31.776
Hey, let's do this
for Grandpa Wolfhouse.

01:41:31.947 --> 01:41:33.539
And for Landfill.

01:41:33.715 --> 01:41:34.909
And Gam Gam?

01:41:35.083 --> 01:41:37.916
And America. On three. One, two, three:

01:41:38.086 --> 01:41:41.249
Grandpa Wolfhouse, Landfill
and Gam Gam and America!

01:41:42.190 --> 01:41:43.589
Go, go, go!

01:41:45.694 --> 01:41:50.393
Line Chug. Germany versus U.S.A.

01:41:50.565 --> 01:41:52.795
Winner is champion...

01:41:52.968 --> 01:41:57.200
...of Beerfest!

01:41:57.372 --> 01:41:59.272
<i>Das Boot! Das Boot! Das Boot!</i>

01:42:00.575 --> 01:42:02.736
Yeah, you can suck your own dick.

01:42:04.479 --> 01:42:06.140
We're gonna take you all the way--

01:42:07.983 --> 01:42:10.577
- Cherry?
- Our finest secret agent.

01:42:10.752 --> 01:42:12.913
We sent her to keep an eye on you.

01:42:18.293 --> 01:42:19.658
Oh, hit that, Grandpapa.

01:42:19.828 --> 01:42:22.023
Take what's yours, Grandpapa.

01:42:22.197 --> 01:42:23.789
Damn, that's nasty.

01:42:23.965 --> 01:42:26.627
Always bet on black. Yeah.

01:42:26.802 --> 01:42:29.362
Yeah, always bet on black.
That's a great quote.

01:42:29.538 --> 01:42:32.974
Game on. Not a drop can be spilled.

01:42:36.244 --> 01:42:38.041
Shake it off.

01:43:22.290 --> 01:43:25.020
Hey, fatass, when I dropped
your brother in that vat...

01:43:25.193 --> 01:43:26.888
...he squealed like a stuffed pig.

01:43:33.401 --> 01:43:35.460
Germany!

01:43:36.071 --> 01:43:37.470
Did you hear what she said?

01:43:42.410 --> 01:43:44.537
Get out of here. Get out!

01:43:44.713 --> 01:43:47.181
No, no. Hey, ump. Do something, ump.

01:43:47.349 --> 01:43:48.543
Losers.

01:43:50.652 --> 01:43:52.779
See you later, stableboy.

01:43:52.954 --> 01:43:54.945
Say hello to the family whore.

01:43:55.123 --> 01:43:59.719
<i>U.S.A. sucks! U.S.A. sucks!
U.S.A. sucks!</i>

01:44:05.233 --> 01:44:06.598
Double or nothing.

01:44:06.768 --> 01:44:08.633
On what, huh?

01:44:08.804 --> 01:44:12.740
The von Wolfhausen family recipe.

01:44:13.508 --> 01:44:15.772
You win, you get to keep it.

01:44:16.611 --> 01:44:19.774
We win, we get your brewery.

01:44:19.948 --> 01:44:22.007
Or should I say our brewery?

01:44:22.184 --> 01:44:25.449
But we already have the recipe.

01:44:27.055 --> 01:44:29.148
I got it off of the nerd's computer.

01:44:30.525 --> 01:44:32.686
- You're fucked.
- Yeah, he's fucked.

01:44:36.164 --> 01:44:38.325
- That's rich, Baron.
- What's so funny?

01:44:38.500 --> 01:44:40.434
I didn't put that recipe on my computer.

01:44:41.236 --> 01:44:46.037
However, you are holding the recipe
for a low-carb strawberry beer.

01:44:46.641 --> 01:44:49.132
We call it She-Wolf. It's okay.

01:44:49.311 --> 01:44:51.472
Strawberry?

01:44:53.014 --> 01:44:54.982
No. No. You know how
you like strawberries?

01:44:55.150 --> 01:44:57.618
You want me to lose weight,
so that was the low-carb--

01:44:57.786 --> 01:45:00.584
Wait a minute, we like strawberry--
Get your damn hands off--

01:45:00.755 --> 01:45:03.747
You're trying to see my panties.
Goddamn it, put me down, please!

01:45:03.925 --> 01:45:08.692
Where are the Africans?
Can the Africans come help me? Jesus!

01:45:11.766 --> 01:45:14.257
So are we gonna play for the recipe...

01:45:14.436 --> 01:45:17.599
...or should I just roll it up
and eat it? I'm hungry.

01:45:17.772 --> 01:45:20.707
Wait, wait. Wait. Wait!

01:45:20.876 --> 01:45:22.468
Put your money where your mouth is.

01:45:22.644 --> 01:45:26.944
Us against you. Ten boots.
Five against five.

01:45:27.115 --> 01:45:30.744
You couldn't even do one boot.
You can barely stand!

01:45:33.121 --> 01:45:34.110
Grandpapa?

01:45:34.756 --> 01:45:37.850
Take the bet, you fucking pussy.

01:45:42.230 --> 01:45:44.858
Okay. Crush the bastards.

01:45:45.967 --> 01:45:48.527
And then I want spectator number one
killed.

01:45:48.703 --> 01:45:52.195
Yeah, this is going to be like taking
black walnut candy from the baby.

01:45:52.374 --> 01:45:55.537
<i>That's very funny, Deutschbag.
Only thing is:</i>

01:45:55.710 --> 01:46:00.409
One, we're not babies, and two--

01:46:00.582 --> 01:46:02.777
We're not that drunk.

01:46:04.686 --> 01:46:08.144
They're not that drunk. Cheeky bastards.

01:46:08.323 --> 01:46:12.089
<i>They're not that drunk!
They're not that drunk!</i>

01:46:12.260 --> 01:46:15.423
<i>They're not that drunk!
They're not that drunk!</i>

01:46:15.597 --> 01:46:17.360
<i>They're not that drunk!</i>

01:46:17.532 --> 01:46:19.329
Five boots? Are you fucking mental?

01:46:19.501 --> 01:46:20.968
Trust me, we can do this.

01:46:21.136 --> 01:46:23.229
Just spin the boot
when the bubble comes.

01:46:23.405 --> 01:46:24.872
Trust me, this will work.

01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:27.440
Gentlemen. Ready?

01:46:27.609 --> 01:46:30.237
Good luck. You're going to need it.

01:46:31.846 --> 01:46:35.247
<i>Das Boot!</i>

01:46:35.417 --> 01:46:37.578
<i>Das Boot! Das Boot! Das Boot!</i>

01:47:01.743 --> 01:47:03.608
<i>Deutschland, you're floored!</i>

01:47:05.680 --> 01:47:08.808
Look, the little one looks like he has
pubic hair all over his head.

01:47:08.984 --> 01:47:11.953
It's okay, it works.
Yeah, because you have a dickface.

01:47:12.120 --> 01:47:14.111
You son of a bitch!

01:47:15.090 --> 01:47:17.081
Yeah.

01:47:17.258 --> 01:47:20.489
I accidentally pushed his thingy off.

01:47:22.063 --> 01:47:24.554
That's a great one. Dickface.

01:47:27.669 --> 01:47:29.034
Fink's got the eye of the Jew.

01:47:29.204 --> 01:47:32.298
He's got the eye of the Jew.
Fink's our anchorman.

01:47:32.474 --> 01:47:35.773
Come on. Trust me. Trust me.

01:47:37.379 --> 01:47:39.210
You just blew it, Friedrich.

01:47:46.921 --> 01:47:48.582
Spin it.

01:47:48.757 --> 01:47:49.781
Come on.

01:47:56.831 --> 01:47:58.765
Spin it.

01:48:07.442 --> 01:48:08.636
Spin it.

01:48:34.035 --> 01:48:37.232
Drink, Fink. Drink, Fink. Drink, Fink.

01:48:37.405 --> 01:48:42.001
<i>Drink, Fink, drink! Drink, Fink, drink!
Drink, Fink, drink!</i>

01:49:16.444 --> 01:49:18.105
U.S.A.

01:49:38.533 --> 01:49:42.401
<i>U.S.A. U.S.A. U.S.A.</i>

01:50:17.739 --> 01:50:20.765
A little R and R in Amsterdam.
Just what the doctor ordered.

01:50:20.942 --> 01:50:24.400
You know, I came to a conference
here once. Hookerthon 2002.

01:50:24.579 --> 01:50:25.978
Fantastic seminars.

01:50:26.147 --> 01:50:27.307
Sounds fun.

01:50:27.482 --> 01:50:30.849
Nothing but the best for the executives
of von Wolfhausen brewery, right?

01:50:31.019 --> 01:50:32.179
That's right.

01:50:32.353 --> 01:50:35.652
Hey, guys, where are we?

01:50:35.823 --> 01:50:40.192
I think the hotel is this way?

01:50:40.361 --> 01:50:41.453
You gotta be kidding me.

01:50:41.629 --> 01:50:43.392
Hold on. Let me check.

01:50:44.632 --> 01:50:46.361
No, I think it's that way.

01:50:51.606 --> 01:50:53.267
Hey.

01:50:53.441 --> 01:50:55.841
- Holy crap, Willie Nelson.
- What are you doing here?

01:50:56.010 --> 01:50:58.137
It's a funny story.
I was invited over here...

01:50:58.313 --> 01:51:01.339
...for this big, secret, international,
pot-smoking competition.

01:51:03.151 --> 01:51:05.551
My teammates, Cheech and Chong,
chickened out on me.

01:51:05.720 --> 01:51:07.779
They wouldn't fly
in my biodiesel airplane...

01:51:07.956 --> 01:51:11.483
...and the smoke-out's in 30 minutes
and I don't wanna get disqualified.

01:51:11.659 --> 01:51:14.628
Now, you guys don't wanna
be my teammates, do you?

01:51:14.796 --> 01:51:16.787
Yeah!

01:51:18.433 --> 01:51:21.266
Let's do it. Did you hear one
about the guy that told his son:

01:51:21.436 --> 01:51:23.427
"If you don't quit masturbating,
you'll go blind."

01:51:23.605 --> 01:51:25.300
He said, "Dad, I'm over here."

01:51:46.861 --> 01:51:48.886
Oh, you guys fancy yourselves
drinkers, huh?

01:51:49.063 --> 01:51:51.827
Yeah, maybe a little bit.
I think we just won the--

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.730
Yeah, I think we just--
Yeah, I think we just--

01:51:54.902 --> 01:51:56.995
What the hell is going on? Yeah.

01:52:02.076 --> 01:52:05.409
- Bastards.
- I was playing Ping-Pong in Ding Dang.

01:52:06.080 --> 01:52:07.411
I was-- I saw that.

01:52:07.582 --> 01:52:10.915
Turned out, the guys I was playing--
The guys-- Okay.

01:52:11.085 --> 01:52:13.610
I was playing Ping-Pong in Ding Dang.

01:52:15.590 --> 01:52:17.353
I mean, come on. Cut it.

01:52:17.525 --> 01:52:19.720
This sweet nectar was my lifeblood.

01:52:20.461 --> 01:52:22.588
Oh, yeah, Landfill.
Go for it, my friend.

01:52:22.764 --> 01:52:24.197
He's got it going on, this guy.

01:52:24.365 --> 01:52:25.627
Are we playing or not?

01:52:25.800 --> 01:52:28.098
<i>Time to schei√üe off the--</i>

01:52:28.636 --> 01:52:29.796
Are we playing or not?

01:52:29.971 --> 01:52:32.030
<i>Time to schei√üe on our--</i>

01:52:32.206 --> 01:52:33.764
Are we playing or not?

01:52:33.941 --> 01:52:36.569
<i>Time to schei√üe or get off the crap.</i>

01:52:36.744 --> 01:52:38.371
Crapper.

01:52:44.352 --> 01:52:45.876
Okay, come back in, do it again.

01:52:46.054 --> 01:52:47.385
All right.

01:52:48.189 --> 01:52:49.918
Everybody's drunk.

01:52:56.631 --> 01:52:59.156
And cut it. Cut.

01:53:08.242 --> 01:53:11.109
One question. Who are we gonna get--?

01:53:13.648 --> 01:53:15.081
Do I know you?

01:53:15.983 --> 01:53:18.076
Me? No. No, I don't think so.

01:53:18.252 --> 01:53:21.744
Well, you look familiar.
Didn't I pay you a dollar for something?

01:53:22.523 --> 01:53:24.548
No, no. Wasn't me, no.

01:53:24.726 --> 01:53:27.752
I remember now. I paid you a dollar
to touch your toes...

01:53:27.929 --> 01:53:29.590
...and then touch your dick.

01:53:31.566 --> 01:53:33.397
Yeah, that could have been me.

01:53:34.602 --> 01:53:36.160
Good to see you again.

01:53:37.605 --> 01:53:41.006
I wish it were winter. We could make it
into ice blocks and skate on it...

01:53:41.175 --> 01:53:43.575
...and then melt it in the springtime
and drink it.

01:53:50.351 --> 01:53:51.340
All right, cut it.

01:53:51.519 --> 01:53:53.111
Cut.
