09:23.160 --> 09:25.325

with some friends for book club.

18:53.576 --> 18:54.784
Hey.

18:54.785 --> 18:55.867
Should I kick him?

18:55.868 --> 18:57.075
Ahem. here.

18:57.076 --> 18:58.700
I drew this for you.

18:58.701 --> 19:01.409
It's a memorial for your
parents who passed away.

19:01.410 --> 19:02.950
I figured, I don't know,

19:02.951 --> 19:04.992
maybe you don't have anything
to remember them by,

19:04.993 --> 19:07.867
and you probably lost all your
photos when the tree fell over.

19:07.868 --> 19:10.211
And maybe, just maybe,

19:10.335 --> 19:14.159
seeing this photo of them will give
you peace in the days to come.

19:14.160 --> 19:15.450
Yeah, right.

19:15.451 --> 19:18.159
(voice breaking) This
is, like, so poorly drawn.

19:18.160 --> 19:19.700
It doesn't even...

19:19.701 --> 19:21.325
- (sobbing)
- I thought it'd be a nice thing to do.

19:21.326 --> 19:22.200
- There you go.
- It's really hitting him now, I think.

19:22.201 --> 19:24.659
Yeah. (crying)

19:24.660 --> 19:26.367
Jesus. Okay, he's full
on crying at this point.

19:26.368 --> 19:29.534
- Nice going, dude, with the picture.
- I'm sorry.

19:29.535 --> 19:30.909
You know what, Dennis, process it, dude.

19:30.910 --> 19:32.409
This is good, man.

19:32.410 --> 19:33.534
(sighs)

19:33.535 --> 19:34.575
You.

19:34.576 --> 19:36.075
You, little dude.

19:36.076 --> 19:39.034
You are a brave and beautiful soul.

19:39.035 --> 19:42.117
Thank you for this gift that
I will cherish forever.

19:42.118 --> 19:42.784
Thank you, Dennis.

19:42.785 --> 19:44.867
You guys go free.

19:44.868 --> 19:45.942
We're gonna stay here and keep an e

19:45.967 --> 19:47.284
ye on the old tree
for as long as she lasts.

19:47.285 --> 19:49.571
Plus, we're gonna ding-dong-ditch

19:49.596 --> 19:51.117
Mrs. Garducci's place.

19:51.118 --> 19:53.729
She doesn't even know what's
coming to her, right?

19:53.730 --> 19:54.617
- Ha! I love that.
- Dennis is back!

19:54.618 --> 19:55.992
(laughing)

19:55.993 --> 19:57.409
Actually, man, you
might wanna probably avoid...

19:57.410 --> 19:58.617
Don't. Just let them go.

19:58.618 --> 19:59.858
Oh, right, right, right, right.

20:01.618 --> 20:02.909
Look, there's the exit!

20:02.910 --> 20:04.534
I see sunlight, we're gonna get out!

20:04.535 --> 20:05.617
That's the roof
opening. Come on, let's go.

20:05.618 --> 20:07.784
- We made it.
- We did it.

20:07.785 --> 20:09.659
Uh, Phil.

20:09.660 --> 20:11.784
Hey, what's up? You're sort
of, like, stopping the momentum.

20:11.785 --> 20:13.950
Before we go out there, I
just have something to say.

20:13.951 --> 20:15.325
Okay.

20:15.326 --> 20:16.992
Things are gonna be
different from now on.

20:16.993 --> 20:18.867
You're not my baby brother.

20:18.868 --> 20:19.950
You're my brother.

20:19.951 --> 20:21.409
My equal.

20:21.410 --> 20:24.284
And I'm sorry for not
seeing that before.

20:24.285 --> 20:25.325
I don't know what to say.

20:25.326 --> 20:26.909
You don't have to say anything...

20:26.910 --> 20:28.867
- Dear Mike, you're my big bro...
- Okay.

20:28.868 --> 20:32.075
A bond that will tie us
together for a lifetime.

20:32.076 --> 20:35.034
Webster's dictionary
defines bro as "an abbreviation

20:35.035 --> 20:36.200
or informal use of brother.

20:36.201 --> 20:38.950
Please see brother for full definition.

20:38.951 --> 20:41.700
- Webster's defines brother as..."
- Okay, maybe just get to it,

20:41.701 --> 20:43.287
just 'cause we're kind
of running out of time.

20:43.412 --> 20:44.575
Okay. Sorry, sorry.

20:44.576 --> 20:46.159
All in all, I'll always look up to you

20:46.160 --> 20:48.075
and turn to you to teach me stuff.

20:48.076 --> 20:52.034
Maybe you can start with
how to ask out a girl?

20:52.035 --> 20:53.868
Come on, what are you waiting for?

20:57.660 --> 20:59.200
Go get 'em, tiger.

20:59.201 --> 21:00.743
(no audible dialogue)

21:08.868 --> 21:10.450
Ahem, how's it going over there,

21:10.451 --> 21:12.659
you love squirrels?

21:12.660 --> 21:15.742
So, do I hear wedding bells?

21:15.743 --> 21:16.992
- She said no.
- What?

21:16.993 --> 21:18.742
- She said no?
- Yes, dude, she said no.

21:18.743 --> 21:20.062
Okay? It's not gonna happen.

21:20.197 --> 21:21.284
Wow, dude.

21:21.285 --> 21:22.492
I'm surprised, to be honest with you.

21:22.493 --> 21:24.534
'Cause I saw the
chemistry between you guys.

21:24.535 --> 21:25.534
That's exactly what I was saying.

21:25.535 --> 21:26.575
I thought the whole time was like...

21:26.576 --> 21:28.534
You want me to go talk to her?

21:28.535 --> 21:30.159
You don't need to go talk to
her. No. I'm gonna go over there.

21:30.160 --> 21:32.200
- I'm going. Just give me a sec.
- Give me a second.

21:34.160 --> 21:37.450
Mike, it's not gonna work
out. I get what she's saying.

21:37.451 --> 21:39.159
She's really busy.

21:39.160 --> 21:41.677
She's not looking for
anything substantial right now,

21:41.795 --> 21:43.659
at least from you specifically.

21:43.660 --> 21:45.517
We're just gonna keep
going though, come on.

21:45.639 --> 21:46.575
We can all be friends.

21:46.576 --> 21:47.376
Don't make it weird.

21:53.701 --> 21:54.992
Dad!

21:54.993 --> 21:56.367
(applause)

21:56.368 --> 21:57.409
Phil: Mommy!

21:57.410 --> 21:58.450
Oh, my God!

21:58.451 --> 21:59.450
Mom!

21:59.451 --> 22:00.450
You're okay!

22:00.451 --> 22:02.242
I thought I lost you.

22:02.243 --> 22:04.200
Mom, I don't want to be left
alone in the apartment again.

22:04.201 --> 22:05.534
I will never leave you alone ever again.

22:05.535 --> 22:07.617
Mom, I don't want to say
this was all Mike's fault,

22:07.618 --> 22:09.534
- but if you notice,
- What the fuck, dude?

22:09.535 --> 22:11.575
It's not my fault. you put him
in charge, and the tree fell over.

22:11.576 --> 22:12.992
- He just cursed, too.
- Phil, are you tattling?

22:12.993 --> 22:14.909
I think that was the
definition of a tattle.

22:14.910 --> 22:16.575
All right, you know
what, from here on out,

22:16.576 --> 22:19.450
Mrs. Garducci's gonna watch you guys.

22:19.451 --> 22:21.034
- That's...
- That's fine.

22:21.035 --> 22:22.166
- That works.
- We can work with that.

22:22.191 --> 22:22.909
I can work with that.

22:22.910 --> 22:24.659
From the looks of what we have here,

22:24.660 --> 22:27.075
we're just hoping to
excavate any remaining survivors.

22:27.076 --> 22:29.034
Excuse me, sir, sorry to interrupt.

22:29.035 --> 22:30.450
Um, maybe this will help?

22:30.451 --> 22:31.909
What is it? Is this a map of the tree?

22:31.910 --> 22:35.034
Yeah. Just roughly
drew some of my surroundings

22:35.035 --> 22:36.117
and where the remaining survivors are.

22:36.118 --> 22:38.742
So, that's singer-songwriter Kurt Vile,

22:38.743 --> 22:40.784
and that's Dennis and
his gang, and that's Old Ben.

22:40.785 --> 22:42.950
Oh, and that's that old
psychic lady who's like, kinda spooky,

22:42.951 --> 22:44.575
but also kinda cool.

22:44.576 --> 22:46.200
And now you can probably
find them all pretty easy.

22:46.201 --> 22:49.284
Oh, and you wanna avoid
that or else you'll get termites.

22:49.285 --> 22:52.867
This is fantastic. I mean, this
is gonna help us save other lives,

22:52.868 --> 22:54.200
it's gonna save firefighters' lives,

22:54.201 --> 22:57.575
and time, which is gonna
save taxpayer money.

22:57.576 --> 22:59.892
The initiative it took to
do something like this.

23:00.029 --> 23:01.700
God, we got a little leader right here.

23:01.701 --> 23:02.659
This is great.

23:02.660 --> 23:04.497
If I had some sort of medal...

23:04.610 --> 23:05.784
What about your hat?

23:05.785 --> 23:06.867
- Well...
- What about your big firefighter hat?

23:06.868 --> 23:08.534
- Can I have it?
- Okay.

23:08.535 --> 23:09.722
Well, I'll let you
put in on for a second.

23:09.747 --> 23:10.118
On TV?

23:10.119 --> 23:11.534
This firefighters' giving
me his hat, everybody.

23:11.535 --> 23:13.450
- Thank you, sir.
- Not gonna... I can't give it to you

23:13.451 --> 23:15.117
- because I do need it.
- It's really heavy.

23:15.118 --> 23:16.742
- Is this super cute?
- Look at this. It is so cute.

23:16.743 --> 23:17.967
If we lose our hat, it's like 100 bucks.

23:17.992 --> 23:18.534
I'll just keep it.

23:18.535 --> 23:20.617
It's fun.

23:20.618 --> 23:22.450
<i>Old Ben: Phil was stabbed
trying to break up a robbery</i>

23:22.451 --> 23:24.534
<i>in a McDonald's dumpster.</i>

23:24.535 --> 23:27.450
<i>Mike and April got
married and had three kids.</i>

23:27.451 --> 23:29.284
<i>They named the firstborn Phil.</i>

23:29.285 --> 23:30.575
<i>He likes to draw,</i>

23:30.576 --> 23:32.367
<i>just like his uncle.</i>

23:32.368 --> 23:34.700
<i>And Dennis and the gang eventually
straightened out,</i>

23:34.701 --> 23:37.409
<i>opened up a home for wayward boys.</i>

23:37.410 --> 23:39.742
<i>And as for Old Ben, well...</i>

23:39.743 --> 23:41.399
Excuse me, who are you?

23:41.534 --> 23:42.450
Hmm? What?

23:42.451 --> 23:43.659
- Oh, you heard...
- Yeah, what...

23:43.660 --> 23:45.284
- Heard me talking to myself?
- What was that?

23:45.285 --> 23:47.117
I was just pretending, you
know, what would happen

23:47.118 --> 23:48.242
in the future to everybody,

23:48.243 --> 23:50.867
and then narrating it like a movie.

23:50.868 --> 23:53.909
- Why'd I have to die, Old Ben?
- I thought we were friends, man?

23:53.910 --> 23:54.825
It's just my imagination.

23:54.826 --> 23:56.659
Phil, how do you know this guy?

23:56.660 --> 23:58.534
This is Old Ben. He like, found me

23:58.535 --> 24:00.242
when we were walking around

24:00.243 --> 24:01.784
and then we hung out in
his apartment for a while.

24:01.785 --> 24:04.909
What?! You had my
child in your apartment?

24:04.910 --> 24:08.033
He was outside my place lost.

24:08.034 --> 24:08.992
It was me and him by himself.

24:08.993 --> 24:10.492
He could have done anything to me.

24:10.493 --> 24:12.808
He came into my... What are you, nuts?

24:12.809 --> 24:13.742
He broke my pencil, Mom.

24:13.743 --> 24:15.242
- He snapped it in two.
- Yeah, that's true.

24:15.243 --> 24:16.575
And then I gave him a new pen.

24:16.576 --> 24:19.034
You little shit. Did you
tell your mother that?

24:19.035 --> 24:21.284
You stay away from my kids.

24:21.285 --> 24:23.117
Keep your kid away from me.

24:23.118 --> 24:25.575
Maybe you should be
arrested for child abandonment?

24:25.576 --> 24:27.700
Where were you tonight, madam?

24:27.701 --> 24:30.575
In a bar, getting drunk like a whore,

24:30.576 --> 24:32.200
whoring around in a bar?

24:32.201 --> 24:35.367
(hawks, spits)

24:35.368 --> 24:37.450
I'll fucking rip your head off!

24:37.451 --> 24:40.118
(piano playing simple melody)
