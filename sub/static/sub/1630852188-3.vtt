Guys, do you remember how,
like, five seconds ago,

01:53.530 --> 01:54.656
we were in a desert?

01:54.739 --> 01:57.450
What the heck is this place?

No, it can't be.

02:05.667 --> 02:08.878

I'd say that feels like a…

02:49.586 --> 02:51.838
Does every island have dinosaurs now?

02:52.547 --> 02:54.090
Let's ask her.

03:02.098 --> 03:03.266
Who's that?

03:09.022 --> 03:11.482
You're trespassing. What are you up to?
[gasps]

03:11.566 --> 03:12.817
Are you here to spy?

03:12.901 --> 03:16.362
Yeah. We're an elite band
of teenage secret agents.

03:16.446 --> 03:17.947
[whispering]
Are you crazy?

03:18.031 --> 03:20.658
You're eating a sandwich
in the middle of a T. rex fight?

03:20.742 --> 03:22.952
First of all, they're not fighting.
They're pla--

03:23.036 --> 03:24.287
Playing!

03:25.747 --> 03:28.541
Cranio-facial biting! It's true!

03:28.625 --> 03:32.086
Uh, yes. Don't change the subject!

03:32.170 --> 03:34.005
Lady, we don't wanna be here, either.

03:34.505 --> 03:35.924
We just wanna go home.

03:36.674 --> 03:40.053
Oh, yeah, we'll see about that. Follow me.

03:42.305 --> 03:45.225
You really expect me to believe
that children survived alone

03:45.308 --> 03:47.977
on Isla Nublar for six entire months?

03:48.061 --> 03:51.272
Trust me.
It's hard for us to believe, too.

03:51.356 --> 03:52.857
Mm-hm.

03:54.025 --> 03:55.860
I suppose you must be telling the truth,

03:55.944 --> 03:59.030
because who would make up
such a crazy story if they didn't have to.

03:59.113 --> 04:03.117
Not saying that you don't have to,
or that you're crazy, but who knows?

04:03.201 --> 04:05.870
I don't know you,
you don't know me for that matter.

04:06.621 --> 04:09.666
Am I yammering on? I've been out here
for the better part of a month

04:09.749 --> 04:12.877
with no one to talk to, and I guess
I had more to say than I realized.

04:13.544 --> 04:15.338
You look so familiar.

04:15.421 --> 04:16.881
-[dinosaur roars]
-[Darius gasps]

04:18.258 --> 04:21.177
Don't worry. They're almost tuckered out.
They won't bother us.

04:21.261 --> 04:22.428
How could you know that?

04:22.512 --> 04:24.806
I study dinosaur brains.
[chuckles]

04:24.889 --> 04:27.308
Behavioral paleoneurobiologist.
I'm Mae Turner--

04:27.392 --> 04:29.727
Turner! That's it! You're Dr. Mae Turner!

04:29.811 --> 04:31.771
It's an honor to meet you.
I read your book.

04:31.854 --> 04:33.940
<i>A Theoretical Emotional Journey
with Theropods.</i>

04:34.023 --> 04:36.192
Ah, you were the one!
[chuckles]

04:36.818 --> 04:39.654
If you could just point us to a phone,
we'll be on our way.

04:39.737 --> 04:42.282
Yeah. Slight problem with that.

04:42.365 --> 04:44.409
This island is completely shut
off the grid.

04:44.492 --> 04:45.910
No communications in or out.

04:45.994 --> 04:47.328
-Are you kidding?
-Why?

04:47.412 --> 04:49.205
Wait, you can't use that to call out?

04:49.289 --> 04:51.207
Sorry. Closed circuit.

04:51.291 --> 04:54.085
Mainly I use this to connect
to a doodad in their brains… Oh!

04:54.168 --> 04:56.879
Can't tell you, actually.
Proprietary research.

04:56.963 --> 04:59.632
So, there's no way home.

05:01.509 --> 05:03.928
Don't lose faith.
You can all rest up with me

05:04.012 --> 05:06.180
until we figure out
how to get you out of here.

05:07.807 --> 05:09.309
Do we trust her?

05:10.643 --> 05:12.603
[laughs]
I'll take that as a no.

05:12.687 --> 05:13.646
[chuckles]

05:17.900 --> 05:20.486
So, the saber-toothed tiger
and the T. rexes,

05:20.570 --> 05:23.031
your bosses are making
prehistoric creatures?

05:23.114 --> 05:25.783
Some. Although they got the T. rexes
from Isla Sorna.

05:25.867 --> 05:28.244
Not that I should be
telling you any of this.

05:28.328 --> 05:31.497
-Why?
-Hold up. Important announcement time.

05:34.417 --> 05:39.005
Whatever you do, do not go down there.

05:41.257 --> 05:42.717
Super dangerous.

05:43.968 --> 05:45.386
All right, off we pop.

05:50.099 --> 05:51.267
We're here.

06:08.367 --> 06:09.660
[Brooklynn] Oh.

06:09.744 --> 06:14.165
Wow. As far as caves go,
this one's pretty swank.

06:14.665 --> 06:15.917
You live here?

06:16.000 --> 06:20.004
Live, work, play surprisingly competitive
games of poker with myself.

06:20.088 --> 06:22.048
I usually win.
[laughs]

06:22.131 --> 06:25.009
[breathy laugh]
Ah!

06:25.593 --> 06:28.012
All right, I'm gonna go whip up
some sandwiches.

06:29.722 --> 06:32.391
[humming]

06:40.399 --> 06:41.609
What are you doing?

06:41.692 --> 06:44.153
We're not gonna just take her word for it,
there's no phone here.

06:44.237 --> 06:47.532
Yeah, dude. Did you learn nothing
from Mitch and Tiff?

06:49.784 --> 06:52.120
I guess it doesn't hurt to look around.

06:52.203 --> 06:54.330
[Dr. Turner continues humming]

06:59.544 --> 07:01.587
[Dr. Turner]
Are you guys all right out there?

07:01.671 --> 07:04.173
Yeah. Uh, no problems over here!

07:08.594 --> 07:09.720
[sighs]

07:09.804 --> 07:12.265
No phone. I think she's telling the truth.

07:13.224 --> 07:16.185
[Dr. Turner continues humming]

07:19.063 --> 07:20.690
[Brooklynn] We got nothing.

07:20.773 --> 07:21.899
Us too.

07:21.983 --> 07:22.900
[Sammy gasps]

07:25.319 --> 07:26.737
Mantah Corp.

07:26.821 --> 07:28.614
-[both gasp]
-[all gasp]

07:28.698 --> 07:31.409
If Mae works for Mantah Corp,
then we gotta get out of here.

07:31.492 --> 07:33.077
-Who wants a sandwich?
-[gasps]

07:35.413 --> 07:36.414
Mmm.

07:38.040 --> 07:40.001
This is really good.

07:46.841 --> 07:48.092
Something wrong?

07:48.176 --> 07:52.013
-Yes. We wanna ask you about--
-Something to drink?

07:52.096 --> 07:54.140
[gasps]
Of course! Silly me.

07:54.223 --> 07:55.975
You need cocoa.

07:57.226 --> 07:59.312
-We need to go.
-Maybe not.

07:59.395 --> 08:02.231
But Mae works for the company
that blackmailed your family.

08:02.815 --> 08:04.692
Yeah. And I did, too.

08:04.775 --> 08:08.696
Sometimes, good people can be made
to do bad things by bad people.

08:08.779 --> 08:11.574
Let's at least check out
that dangerous area.

08:11.657 --> 08:13.326
What if there's a phone
or a way off the island,

08:13.409 --> 08:14.952
and she's just trying
to keep us away from it?

08:15.036 --> 08:17.288
-Why would she do that?
-So we can't tell anyone

08:17.371 --> 08:19.999
about whatever shady stuff
Mantah Corp is doing here.

08:20.082 --> 08:22.418
Okay. I'll keep her busy
while you check it out.

08:22.502 --> 08:23.461
I'll stay, too.

08:23.544 --> 08:25.630
Maybe we'll get some answers
while we're at it.

08:25.713 --> 08:29.133
So, it's settled. Kenji and Brooklynn
will go check it out.

08:30.676 --> 08:33.429
You and Ben should come too.
We don't know what's out there.

08:34.805 --> 08:36.057
[door opens]

08:42.480 --> 08:44.106
Bad news. I only have two cups.

08:44.190 --> 08:47.235
Good news, with the right attitude,
a bowl can be a cup!

08:47.318 --> 08:48.653
[chuckles]

08:48.736 --> 08:52.031
-Wait, where did everyone go?
-Taking a nap.

08:52.573 --> 08:55.368
Oh. I'll go see
if they need extra blankets.

08:56.869 --> 08:58.621
I should have some in the back closet.

08:58.704 --> 08:59.830
[Darius] Dr. Turner!

09:00.414 --> 09:03.960
You figured out how to tell
what a dinosaur is… feeling?

09:04.043 --> 09:05.253
That's amazing!

09:05.336 --> 09:08.089
Once I made sure the behaviors
the dinosaurs exhibited

09:08.172 --> 09:09.924
matched the cortical activity,

09:10.007 --> 09:13.177
it was only a matter of time
before I could anticipate their needs.

09:13.678 --> 09:15.429
Who did you say you worked for?

09:15.513 --> 09:16.597
I didn't. What--

09:16.681 --> 09:19.934
This could change everything
we know about dinosaurs.

09:20.017 --> 09:22.019
Hypothetically, mm-hm.

09:32.196 --> 09:33.197
[metal clanks]

09:33.281 --> 09:35.908
Another metal rectangle,
like the one we saw in the desert.

09:35.992 --> 09:38.744
Bones. It's a feeding platform.

09:38.828 --> 09:41.914
Which means we should probably
get outta here before mealtime.

09:51.841 --> 09:53.342
[Ben grunts]

09:54.093 --> 09:55.094
Ben.

09:56.554 --> 10:01.601
I am curious. Uh, who ate grubs first?
You or Bumpy?

10:01.684 --> 10:03.394
On purpose? Me.

10:03.477 --> 10:06.856
What? That sounds like a story.
[laughs]

10:07.857 --> 10:11.861
So, hypothetically,
this is the coolest thing ever!

10:11.944 --> 10:15.489
I know! We can anticipate their needs
instead of just guessing,

10:15.573 --> 10:19.076
and I really have to shush up because
I'm not supposed to be telling you this!

10:19.160 --> 10:22.371
-Okay. So, that's what you're doin'.
-[Dr. Turner] Hmm.

10:22.455 --> 10:26.042
Don't know what you're talking about.
These are just random hypotheticals.

10:26.125 --> 10:31.631
So, hypothetically, what do your bosses
plan to do with your research?

10:31.714 --> 10:33.174
I can't say exactly.

10:33.257 --> 10:36.636
But it's safe to assume that once
this research facility is up and running,

10:36.719 --> 10:39.889
we'll be making scientific breakthroughs
left and right!

10:41.307 --> 10:42.558
I hope you're right.

10:43.851 --> 10:47.730
So, I said, "That's what you get for
walking with your mouth open, Bumpster."

10:47.813 --> 10:49.940
[Ben] But when there were
no digestive issues,

10:50.024 --> 10:52.318
I figured,
"Eh, anything can be food once."

10:54.195 --> 10:56.906
Wow. No one has ever smiled
at the end of that story.

10:57.490 --> 10:59.408
Well, it's the way you tell it.

[screeching]

11:18.761 --> 11:22.306

all the way from the boat?

Hmm. That's a new sound.

12:01.429 --> 12:04.557
I don't think she has any idea
Mantah Corp is bad news,

12:04.640 --> 12:07.226
which makes them double evil lying liars!

12:07.309 --> 12:10.479
"Unauthorized life form detected

12:10.563 --> 12:14.233

Oh, that sounds extreme.

Never do that again for starters.

13:14.001 --> 13:16.545
You killed a Compsognathus
I could have studied!

13:16.629 --> 13:19.465
We don't have any here on the island.
Why would you do that?

One of the BRADs.
Bio Robotic Assistance Droids.

13:54.458 --> 13:57.962
They care for the island,
but I had no idea they did that!

13:58.045 --> 13:59.672
You mean killing?

13:59.755 --> 14:01.298
Back to the cave.

14:01.382 --> 14:04.343
The BRADs aren't authorized to go
in there, you'll be safe inside.

14:04.426 --> 14:07.346
And then, you can explain
why you lied to me,

14:07.429 --> 14:09.682
and why you were out here
in the first place!

14:12.518 --> 14:15.354
After everything Mantah Corp said
they'd do to my family,

14:15.938 --> 14:17.731
can you blame us for not trusting you?

14:17.815 --> 14:19.483
No, I suppose not.

14:19.984 --> 14:24.029
But the work I'm doing is good.
How could understanding dinosaurs be bad?

14:24.655 --> 14:26.574
Yeah, well, until five minutes ago,

14:26.657 --> 14:29.076
you thought those BRADs
were just friendly assistants.

14:29.159 --> 14:32.037
Okay, the BRADs were programmed
to protect the biomes.

14:32.121 --> 14:35.583
I don't think anyone anticipated six kids
and a Compy showing up unannounced.

14:35.666 --> 14:38.127
-[beeps]
-Drat. It's almost dinner time.

14:38.210 --> 14:42.214
-What, you getting takeout?
-Dinner time for the T. rexes.

14:42.298 --> 14:45.718
I get the rare opportunity to observe
mother-daughter eating habits.

14:46.510 --> 14:48.554
It's actually surprisingly sweet.

14:49.305 --> 14:53.309
Until I can figure out how to ensure
your safety, you all remain here.

14:53.392 --> 14:55.686
Stay away from killer robots
and dinosaurs?

14:55.769 --> 14:57.646
Yeah, no problem.

15:07.114 --> 15:10.784
Odd. The BRADs usually steer clear
when it's feeding time.

15:11.410 --> 15:12.453
-So…
-[gasps]

15:12.536 --> 15:13.996
Do you ring a dinner bell or…

15:14.079 --> 15:15.831
Goodness. What are you do…

15:16.332 --> 15:17.583
Go back right now!

15:17.666 --> 15:20.544
That'd probably be more dangerous, since…

15:20.628 --> 15:22.963
[robot whirring]

15:27.259 --> 15:28.844
-Shh.
-[rumbling]

15:45.235 --> 15:46.111
[sighs]

15:46.695 --> 15:48.697
Hey, Ben, how about a game?

15:48.781 --> 15:50.366
Not much of a card person.

15:50.449 --> 15:53.160
Cool. Yeah, cool. Uh…

15:53.243 --> 15:57.414
Then, uh, wanna help me
make some snacks in the kitchen?

16:01.043 --> 16:03.671
-Uh…
-I do, Yaz.

16:10.594 --> 16:12.388
Dude! What's up with you?

16:12.471 --> 16:15.683
Nothing. Just being a good wingman.

16:15.766 --> 16:18.477
You totally have a crush on Brooklynn.

16:18.560 --> 16:19.687
No, I don't.

16:23.399 --> 16:27.861
Okay, fine. But even if I do,
you're being super weird.

16:27.945 --> 16:29.655
Uh, she's gonna know something's up.

16:29.738 --> 16:31.031
[chuckles]

16:31.115 --> 16:34.368
-Go make your move, stud.
-Stud?

16:34.451 --> 16:40.749
Yaz, until I'm ready,
can you just… chill? Please?

16:43.335 --> 16:44.545
-[door beeps]

16:53.220 --> 16:56.640
[robot approaching]

16:57.433 --> 16:59.643
-[gasps]
-She said they weren't allowed in here!

16:59.727 --> 17:00.602
Hide!

17:03.731 --> 17:06.108
[ominous music]

[both gasp]

17:46.065 --> 17:47.816
[Dr. Turner] Aw.

17:47.900 --> 17:48.984
Aren't they cute?

17:49.777 --> 17:53.155
You know, Big Eatie
always lets Little Eatie eat first.

17:53.238 --> 17:55.324
[whispering]
I can't believe this is your job!

17:55.407 --> 17:56.867
Not helping.

17:59.536 --> 18:01.330
[munching]

18:05.167 --> 18:09.838
See, Sammy? How could any of this
possibly be a bad thing?

18:18.722 --> 18:20.849
-[roaring]
-[all gasp]

18:21.767 --> 18:23.018
-Mae?
-Huh?

18:24.103 --> 18:26.021
Their aggression levels
are off the charts.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.481
I've never seen this before!

18:29.233 --> 18:32.778
[both growling]

18:34.113 --> 18:36.156
[gasps]
No, they're hurting each other.

18:41.286 --> 18:44.581
[Dr. Turner] Her pain receptors are dark.

18:47.709 --> 18:48.752
What is happening?

18:49.711 --> 18:51.130
Mantah Corp.

18:53.382 --> 18:56.677
I have to call a BRAD to tranquilize them
before they hurt each other.

18:59.805 --> 19:01.306

No, thank you.

20:40.906 --> 20:43.408
Come on. Let's go.

20:43.492 --> 20:44.993
[Sammy] Dr. Turner!

20:50.332 --> 20:52.084
Is this normally in their food?

20:56.713 --> 20:58.382
-[relieved sighs]
-Oh!

20:58.465 --> 21:00.592
Did you see that swing?

21:00.676 --> 21:02.511
Oh, it was perfect!

21:02.594 --> 21:03.553
[chuckles]

21:05.847 --> 21:08.850
Hey, guys.
Could you give me and Yaz a second?

21:09.518 --> 21:10.811
Uh… sure.

21:13.355 --> 21:15.857
Yaz, listen. Um…

21:15.941 --> 21:18.944
You're a great girl, and I like you.

21:19.027 --> 21:22.656
But I just don't like like you.

21:22.739 --> 21:24.157
-What?
-[Ben] Don't be upset.

21:24.241 --> 21:27.619
It's just that I'm just now
starting to find myself,

21:27.703 --> 21:30.706
and I gotta work on me
before I can think about someone else.

21:31.290 --> 21:32.165
Ben!

21:35.335 --> 21:38.297
I totally understand. Thanks.

21:42.718 --> 21:43.969
[door beeps, buzzes]

21:50.642 --> 21:52.519
What happened here?

21:52.602 --> 21:54.730
Uh, it came in a few minutes
after you left.

21:54.813 --> 21:56.481
It was scanning all over the place.

21:57.065 --> 22:00.027
There goes the one place
we were supposed to be safe.

22:00.110 --> 22:01.903
[sighs]
Apologies, Sammy.

22:01.987 --> 22:04.364
Seems you were right
to be suspicious of Mantah Corp.

22:08.535 --> 22:11.121
Time to find out
what they're doing to my dinosaurs.

-[shatters]

22:29.014 --> 22:31.099
[Kash] Are you kidding me?

22:31.183 --> 22:34.102
Stupid dinosaurs
destroyed one of my BRADs?
