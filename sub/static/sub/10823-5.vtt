WEBVTT

00:00.022 --> 00:00.707
Previously on Ravenswood.

00:00.729 --> 00:03.167
I'm looking for Mr. Rivers.
I think we're family.

00:03.169 --> 00:05.336
He never signed it.
He lost the battle.

00:05.338 --> 00:06.307
Who? Who are you talking about?

00:06.318 --> 00:09.541
You must know what you're up against, boy.
It's your turn now.

00:09.543 --> 00:10.642
These keys are official.

00:10.644 --> 00:12.076
There's a county stamp on them.

00:12.078 --> 00:13.144
It's faded but it's there.

00:13.146 --> 00:15.011
So you think that
one of these keys

00:15.013 --> 00:16.547
fits into a door
in your school?

00:16.549 --> 00:18.148
Miranda,
what are you looking for?

00:18.150 --> 00:19.817
That.

00:19.819 --> 00:21.217
He doesn't wanna come near me
when I'm alive

00:21.219 --> 00:23.386
but thinks he can
keep some of me when I'm dead?!

00:23.388 --> 00:25.155
Why are you keeping pieces
of her in this room?

00:25.157 --> 00:26.356
What are you talking about?

00:26.358 --> 00:28.391
You know
what I'm talking about!

00:28.393 --> 00:29.559
We are on to you.

00:29.561 --> 00:30.760
So is Miranda.

00:30.762 --> 00:33.563
I kissed Tess today.

00:33.565 --> 00:34.597
What?

00:34.599 --> 00:35.965
Mom?

00:38.435 --> 00:39.836

00:53.148 --> 00:54.549
Mom?

00:59.254 --> 01:01.755
Is this heaven?

01:03.257 --> 01:05.425
It's where
you're supposed to be.

01:05.427 --> 01:07.828
Hey, sleepyhead.

01:09.564 --> 01:11.031
Dad?

01:11.033 --> 01:12.933
You hungry?

01:12.935 --> 01:15.402
I made you
chocolate chip pancakes.

01:15.404 --> 01:17.737
They used to be your favorite.

01:17.739 --> 01:21.040
(Chuckles)

01:21.042 --> 01:22.642
(Sighs)

01:25.479 --> 01:27.647
I can stay, right?

01:27.649 --> 01:30.149
I don't have to leave?

01:30.151 --> 01:32.051
We're your family, Miranda.

01:32.053 --> 01:34.019
Where else would you go?

01:36.756 --> 01:40.325
I feel so normal here.

01:40.327 --> 01:41.927
That's because you're home.

01:48.234 --> 01:51.235
If there's anything else
you need, just let us know.

01:51.237 --> 01:53.103
All that's for me?

01:53.105 --> 01:55.706
I've never had more
than a few outfits before.

02:03.515 --> 02:08.184
You'd be surprised at how many looks you
can create out of a ten-piece wardrobe.

02:10.854 --> 02:12.923
We didn't want to leave you.

02:12.925 --> 02:15.358
I know, mom.

02:22.498 --> 02:24.700
Miranda?

02:26.703 --> 02:27.970
What is that?

02:36.112 --> 02:38.345
Max likes to play
hide and seek.

02:38.347 --> 02:40.481
Is she my sister?

02:40.483 --> 02:42.116
We found her
playing in the yard.

02:42.118 --> 02:45.753
We don't know how she got here,
but we're taking care of her.

02:45.755 --> 02:49.958
Hi. I'm Miranda.

02:51.326 --> 02:52.994
Max doesn't talk.

02:52.996 --> 02:54.595
But she will soon.

02:55.964 --> 02:57.898
Hope you girls are hungry.

02:59.567 --> 03:01.468
I love you.

03:01.470 --> 03:04.437
I love you, too.
I really do.

03:30.162 --> 03:32.097

03:42.607 --> 03:45.743
Miranda thinks she's safe.

03:45.745 --> 03:47.344
But she isn't.

03:47.346 --> 03:49.279
That little girl
wants to hurt her.

03:49.281 --> 03:51.581
Are you sure that's not
just what it sounds like...

03:51.583 --> 03:53.017
a bad dream?

03:53.019 --> 03:54.618
You don't have to be here
if you don't want to, Luke.

03:54.620 --> 03:55.820
I called your sister, not you.

04:01.125 --> 04:03.026
This happened once before.

04:03.028 --> 04:06.029
Miranda came to me to show
me that thing on the bridge,

04:06.031 --> 04:07.864
and this felt as real as that.

04:07.866 --> 04:09.699
You said she was
with her parents.

04:09.701 --> 04:11.233
They must be in a safe place.

04:11.235 --> 04:13.636
I don't think that they know
what this little girl is.

04:13.638 --> 04:14.970
And what is she?

04:14.972 --> 04:16.103
I'm not sure.

04:18.841 --> 04:22.077
So all of this stuff
was in Henry's box?

04:23.813 --> 04:25.947
Who's "S. L."?

04:25.949 --> 04:27.783
It's who drew the map in 1918,

04:27.785 --> 04:29.450
signed his initials
next to the date.

04:29.452 --> 04:30.584
Who is he?

04:30.586 --> 04:32.486
That's the year
Caleb and Miranda died.

04:32.488 --> 04:36.090
The original Caleb and Miranda.

04:36.092 --> 04:39.894
How's this stuff supposed to help
us know what we're up against?

04:39.896 --> 04:41.962
Hey...

04:41.964 --> 04:44.298
Henry said he never signed it,

04:44.300 --> 04:46.299
and I think he's talking
about this letter.

04:46.301 --> 04:48.768
I think it's from Caleb
to Miranda.

04:48.770 --> 04:50.570
The original Caleb and Miranda.

04:50.572 --> 04:53.272
I don't think they ever gave it to her.
It's not even finished.

04:53.274 --> 04:54.674
What does it say?

04:57.611 --> 04:59.813
Everyone says we're too young
to know what we want,

04:59.815 --> 05:02.380
but I've known
since I first saw you.

05:06.186 --> 05:08.987
When we're not together,

05:08.989 --> 05:11.056
I feel like I'm missing
a part of me.

05:14.160 --> 05:16.428
I'm worthless without you.

05:16.430 --> 05:20.198
I breathe, but...
I don't exist.

05:23.802 --> 05:25.436
Miranda.

05:34.378 --> 05:37.513
I don't know if hearing
that makes me happy or sad.

05:37.515 --> 05:40.117
Was Caleb writing Miranda to
see if she felt the same way?

05:40.119 --> 05:41.484
Maybe it didn't matter.

05:46.690 --> 05:49.392
Is this a map of Ravenswood?

05:49.394 --> 05:51.693
Or I thought a plot
of land somewhere.

05:51.695 --> 05:55.131
It's a box of questions,
not answers.

05:59.502 --> 06:00.803
This is where she is.

06:02.739 --> 06:04.573
That's Miranda's room
from my dream.

06:07.843 --> 06:09.110
Are you sure?

06:09.112 --> 06:10.645
Yes, that's her bed

06:10.647 --> 06:13.481
and... and
the same wallpaper.

06:13.483 --> 06:17.051
Henry would know where this is.

06:17.053 --> 06:19.954
(Message indicator blinks)

06:21.423 --> 06:22.623
Collins needs me at the house.

06:26.861 --> 06:29.496
So, I'm thinking that we should
all meet in a few hours.

06:29.498 --> 06:31.265
We can all take a drive
to the nursing home.

06:31.267 --> 06:32.933
Um...

06:32.935 --> 06:34.902
All four of us
in a car together?

06:34.904 --> 06:37.037
We can't avoid it forever, Liv.

06:37.039 --> 06:40.740
You know what? I don't think I'm
gonna take this to the house.

06:40.742 --> 06:43.109
I'll keep it safe.

06:47.515 --> 06:49.382
All right, I'll see
you guys later.

06:55.087 --> 06:56.755
Listen, I know you
have to get to work,

06:56.757 --> 06:58.691
but can we talk for a minute?

06:58.693 --> 07:00.292
My dad needs me to call him. I'm
supposed to be working right now.

07:00.294 --> 07:02.227
Okay.

07:04.096 --> 07:05.497
You coming?

07:29.721 --> 07:32.922
Is this about Dillon
or the curse?

07:32.924 --> 07:36.159
It's about I'm in the mood
for some snicker doodles.

07:36.161 --> 07:37.561
For breakfast?

07:37.563 --> 07:38.795
Brunch.

07:38.797 --> 07:42.232
Live, I gained 10 pounds
after dad died.

07:42.234 --> 07:45.934
If you're starting another
baking bender, I'm out.

07:45.936 --> 07:47.603
You say that now.

07:55.412 --> 07:57.179
Do you want to talk about it?

07:57.181 --> 07:59.113
It's my fault.

07:59.115 --> 08:00.314
Not hers.

08:00.316 --> 08:02.650
What'd you do?

08:02.652 --> 08:03.985
I was honest about something

08:03.987 --> 08:06.220
that I should have
kept to myself.

08:07.590 --> 08:09.524
Something you screwed up?

08:09.526 --> 08:12.293
Yeah.
I definitely screwed up.

08:12.295 --> 08:14.862
You didn't get a few points
for telling Remy about it?

08:14.864 --> 08:17.531
I'm starting to think
the truth's overrated.

08:17.533 --> 08:19.533
You're lucky you can be honest.

08:19.535 --> 08:21.702
Some of us don't have
that luxury.

08:21.704 --> 08:24.438
Dillon thinks you're trading
him in for your new friends.

08:29.010 --> 08:31.176
Did he tell you that?

08:31.178 --> 08:33.613
Well, no, but you can see
how it looks to him.

08:33.615 --> 08:35.715
You're always blowing Dillon
off for Caleb and Remy.

08:35.717 --> 08:38.784
I'm not blowing him off.
I'm protecting him.

08:38.787 --> 08:40.652
Dad found out about the pact,

08:40.654 --> 08:42.453
and it got him killed.

08:44.991 --> 08:47.059
You and Remy might be
going through something,

08:47.061 --> 08:49.395
but at least you're
in this together.

08:49.397 --> 08:51.397
Liv.

08:51.399 --> 08:54.066
You've always been
the optimist.

08:54.068 --> 08:58.202
If I've got to be the one to
start cheering people up,

08:58.204 --> 09:00.871
it's gonna get
pretty dire around here.

09:00.873 --> 09:02.974
(Chuckles)

09:02.976 --> 09:06.544
We're all handling it
the way we need to.

09:06.546 --> 09:11.849
(Sighs) Yeah, well, you're
handling it by not handling it.

09:11.851 --> 09:15.752
There's nothing wrong
with wanting to feel normal.

09:15.754 --> 09:18.355
I don't even know
what that means anymore.

09:31.601 --> 09:32.701
No.

09:33.870 --> 09:35.438
No, no, no.

09:41.878 --> 09:43.379
I'm sorry for your loss.

09:46.782 --> 09:48.783
He looks terrified.

09:50.086 --> 09:51.786
I'm sure he was.

09:54.523 --> 09:56.157
What did you say?

09:56.159 --> 09:59.627
I've seen it before.
He was scared to death.

10:07.253 --> 10:08.853
Remy, I've never seen
anything like it.

10:09.786 --> 10:11.852
How can we find out
what happened?

10:11.854 --> 10:13.153
<i>Do you think Collins knows?</i>

10:13.155 --> 10:15.589
When he said he was scared
to death, he meant it.

10:20.662 --> 10:22.662
Hey, let me call you back.

10:22.664 --> 10:24.631
Okay.

10:37.644 --> 10:39.077
(Knock at door)

10:45.151 --> 10:48.654
Mr. Collins is working
through lunch,

10:48.656 --> 10:51.590
and I presumed that you
would take yours here.

10:53.992 --> 10:57.762
I'm not a guest anymore.
I work here.

10:57.764 --> 10:59.497
You don't need
to bring me my lunch.

10:59.499 --> 11:04.168
I like taking care of people.
I hope you enjoy it.

11:04.170 --> 11:05.102
Hmm...

11:09.007 --> 11:11.341
Do you recognize that place?

11:11.343 --> 11:12.676
No.

11:12.678 --> 11:14.944
Should I?

11:20.351 --> 11:22.686
You're looking for Miranda,
aren't you?

11:27.858 --> 11:31.527
You should think of
what she wanted the most.

11:31.529 --> 11:33.128
That was to be with her family.

11:33.130 --> 11:36.465
Then Miranda may have
found her way to their home.

11:36.467 --> 11:39.234
Wasn't that the Collins house?

11:39.236 --> 11:44.739
No. Miranda's father
was a teacher.

11:44.741 --> 11:48.610
And after the wedding, they
moved closer to the college.

11:48.612 --> 11:53.615
I'm sure we still
have the address.

11:53.617 --> 11:56.484
If you're interested.

11:56.486 --> 11:58.218
I'm interested.

11:58.220 --> 12:00.654
I'll get it for you.

12:10.498 --> 12:15.301
â™ª One wall at a time â™ª

12:15.303 --> 12:16.736
â™ª you never cry â™ª

12:16.738 --> 12:18.438
(knock at door)

12:20.073 --> 12:23.676
â™ª All those tears were mine â™ª

12:26.413 --> 12:30.916
â™ª would you
stay around this time? â™ª

12:30.918 --> 12:34.185
- Hey.
- Hi.

12:34.187 --> 12:36.187
I've been calling you
all morning.

12:36.189 --> 12:38.790
Can we not start like this?
Please.

12:41.594 --> 12:44.262
You're right. I'm sorry.

12:44.264 --> 12:47.264
I worry, that's all.

12:47.266 --> 12:49.767
With everything
that's happened.

12:51.937 --> 12:55.673
I know I haven't been around as
much lately, but I'm fine. Really.

12:55.675 --> 12:57.407
I miss you, Liv.

12:59.611 --> 13:01.711
I miss you, too.

13:04.949 --> 13:06.616
What's in the box?

13:06.618 --> 13:08.818
It's just some old stuff.

13:08.820 --> 13:12.054
Whose old stuff?

13:12.056 --> 13:15.124
It's Caleb's.

13:15.126 --> 13:18.126
Why am I not surprised?
All roads lead back to Caleb.

13:18.128 --> 13:19.661
It's not like that, Dillon.

13:19.663 --> 13:21.396
You don't have to be jealous.

13:21.398 --> 13:23.131
Then what is it like?

13:23.133 --> 13:24.733
He's alone, okay?
He doesn't have anybody.

13:24.735 --> 13:25.901
He seems to have you.

13:25.903 --> 13:28.637
That doesn't mean you don't.

13:28.639 --> 13:30.739
So why do you have it?

13:30.741 --> 13:33.141
It belonged to
a relative of his.

13:33.143 --> 13:34.809
He passed away this morning.

13:34.811 --> 13:36.811
He really wanted
Caleb to have it.

13:36.813 --> 13:39.313
He's trying to figure out why.

13:39.315 --> 13:44.919
â™ª Would you
stay with us tonight? â™ª

13:44.921 --> 13:47.421
Maybe I can help.

13:47.423 --> 13:50.657
Let's look through it together.

13:50.659 --> 13:53.994
Do you want something to eat?

13:53.996 --> 13:56.195
Yeah.

13:58.666 --> 14:03.637
â™ª 'Cause I'm yours to keep
if you want â™ª

14:05.205 --> 14:07.105
â™ª

14:11.044 --> 14:13.378
Hey.

14:13.380 --> 14:16.348
I'm not stalking you,
I promise.

14:16.350 --> 14:19.351
But I really do wanna finish
what we started last night.

14:19.353 --> 14:22.186
You were pretty clear.
I don't need to hear anymore.

14:22.188 --> 14:25.456
I didn't mean to take any of it out on you.
I really didn't.

14:25.458 --> 14:28.526
(Phone rings)

14:31.430 --> 14:32.897
Stop trying, okay?

14:32.899 --> 14:34.398
If you want to help us
with what we were

14:34.400 --> 14:36.067
talking about this morning,
I'm fine with that.

14:36.069 --> 14:39.369
But I am not
your girlfriend anymore.

14:39.371 --> 14:40.971
Cashier: Next in line.

15:08.565 --> 15:11.566
Great, an empty lot.

15:16.405 --> 15:19.340
It's a shame
he had to go like that.

15:19.342 --> 15:21.910
He knew it was coming.

15:21.912 --> 15:24.646
Caleb is looking for Miranda.

15:24.648 --> 15:28.882
You need to do it tonight.

15:32.845 --> 15:34.294
(Phone rings)

15:37.502 --> 15:42.171
(Beeps)

15:42.173 --> 15:44.240
Hey.

15:44.242 --> 15:47.476
How can you be so close
yet so far away?

15:47.478 --> 15:48.877
What do you mean?

15:48.879 --> 15:53.915
I mean, we talk, but you don't
really say anything.

15:53.917 --> 15:58.420
Um, there's not much to say.

15:58.422 --> 16:00.755
Miranda's Uncle's a jerk,

16:00.757 --> 16:03.090
<i>and I'm trying to help her</i>
<i>get out of Ravenswood.</i>

16:03.092 --> 16:05.593
Are you bringing
her home with you?

16:05.595 --> 16:08.295
<i>I don't think so.</i>

16:08.297 --> 16:10.765
Well, I can't say
I'm happy about it.

16:10.767 --> 16:12.767
I mean, she's nice
and everything but...

16:12.769 --> 16:14.035
<i>Hanna...</i>

16:14.037 --> 16:17.371
I love you.

16:19.607 --> 16:21.742
Now you don't seem so far away.

16:24.111 --> 16:26.780
I don't think this is a map.

16:26.782 --> 16:30.283
You remember that drafting class
I took at Cicero college?

16:30.285 --> 16:33.453
Yeah, I hardly saw you
last summer because of it.

16:33.455 --> 16:35.655
See these numbers?

16:35.657 --> 16:37.122
It's a scale factor.

16:37.124 --> 16:40.826
One inch on the page equals
ten feet of actual space.

16:40.828 --> 16:43.029
So this is a blueprint?

16:43.031 --> 16:47.366
And this note at the top,
negative elevation.

16:47.368 --> 16:49.401
It's a basement somewhere.

16:54.406 --> 16:58.677
Maybe SL was the architect.

17:02.514 --> 17:03.782
No results.

17:06.818 --> 17:09.653
You said Remy's been
helping you with this, right?

17:09.655 --> 17:11.821
Yeah, it's too late
to call her, though.

17:11.824 --> 17:16.060
I can try tomorrow, see if she
can find anything at the paper.

17:16.061 --> 17:19.063
I'd like to talk to her, too.

17:19.065 --> 17:20.430
Would you be okay with that?

17:26.536 --> 17:27.804
Was that a yes?

17:29.673 --> 17:31.608
I think I need
to hear it again.

17:36.847 --> 17:40.782
You know, I was gonna
surprise you, but I know you...

17:40.784 --> 17:42.417
hate surprises.

17:42.419 --> 17:44.786
I made a reservation
this weekend

17:44.788 --> 17:46.021
for Ravenswood Inn.

17:46.023 --> 17:47.522
For who?

17:47.524 --> 17:49.190
<i>For me and you.</i>

17:49.192 --> 17:51.526
You know, I thought that
if things are so complicated

17:51.528 --> 17:54.228
<i>with Miranda that you</i>
<i>can't come see me, then...</i>

17:54.230 --> 17:56.063
I'll just come to you.

17:56.065 --> 17:59.066
That's a long drive for a meal.

17:59.068 --> 18:01.401
I'm not going
for the food, Caleb.

18:01.403 --> 18:03.237
I'm coming to see you.

18:03.239 --> 18:05.539
Hey, you know what?

18:05.541 --> 18:07.875
I have a better idea.

18:07.877 --> 18:10.777
Why don't you make a rez
at the Apple Rose Grill?

18:10.779 --> 18:13.212
Really?

18:13.214 --> 18:14.547
I'm coming home.

18:14.549 --> 18:16.482
You promise?

18:16.484 --> 18:17.717
I promise.

18:17.719 --> 18:19.619
<i>Well, do you wanna bail</i>
<i>on the restaurant</i>

18:19.621 --> 18:21.955
and just eat take-out
and cuddle?

18:21.957 --> 18:24.958
Like Teddy bears?

18:24.960 --> 18:26.959
<i>(Laughs)</i>

18:26.961 --> 18:28.794
What is so funny?

18:28.796 --> 18:30.829
Nothing.
You saying "Teddy bears."

18:30.831 --> 18:32.798
It just makes me laugh.

18:32.800 --> 18:33.966
<i>Say it again.</i>

18:33.968 --> 18:35.801
No, that's not gonna happen.

18:35.803 --> 18:37.970
Come on, just one more time.

18:37.972 --> 18:39.437
No.

18:39.439 --> 18:41.906
I promise that I won't laugh.

18:41.908 --> 18:43.908
(Sighs)

18:43.910 --> 18:45.143
Teddy bears.

18:45.145 --> 18:46.844
(Laughs)

18:46.846 --> 18:49.781
Okay, I'm hanging up now.

18:49.783 --> 18:52.616
Caleb...

18:52.618 --> 18:54.118
I love you.

18:54.120 --> 18:56.353
I love you, too.

19:18.609 --> 19:20.042
<i>Caleb.</i>

19:22.846 --> 19:24.380
<i>Caleb.</i>

19:24.382 --> 19:29.151
You're in danger. That little
girl Max, she wants to hurt you.

19:29.153 --> 19:31.820
What? No, she's just
a lost little girl.

19:31.822 --> 19:35.023
Miranda, this is a dream.

19:35.025 --> 19:37.459
Okay, like this room
isn't even real.

19:37.461 --> 19:39.094
(Loud banging)

19:55.210 --> 19:56.777
Max?

20:15.429 --> 20:16.529
Miranda...

20:16.531 --> 20:18.364
You can leave here.

20:18.366 --> 20:22.568
This is the way out.

20:28.007 --> 20:30.276
Are you okay, Max?

20:32.178 --> 20:33.679
(Sighs)

20:33.681 --> 20:36.213
I'm where I want to be.

20:36.215 --> 20:38.816
And you can go now.

20:41.219 --> 20:42.353
Miranda.

20:42.355 --> 20:45.356
Do you want to sleep
in here with me?

20:45.358 --> 20:46.291
Okay.

21:00.137 --> 21:01.538
Miranda.

21:05.042 --> 21:06.975
(Rustling)

21:20.890 --> 21:22.924
(Gasps)

22:35.524 --> 22:37.759
So you've been sleepwalking
since the accident

22:37.761 --> 22:39.094
and you didn't think
you should tell me this?

22:39.096 --> 22:40.595
You can't handle
your own truth.

22:40.597 --> 22:42.530
Why would I think
you could handle mine?

22:42.532 --> 22:45.866
I've always been there
for you, Remy.

22:45.868 --> 22:47.534
Were you there for me
when you were kissing Tess?

22:47.536 --> 22:48.869
You kissed Tess?

22:48.871 --> 22:50.370
Liv, please.

22:50.372 --> 22:53.207
Look, whatever you guys
are dealing with,

22:53.209 --> 22:54.708
you're gonna have
to get over it.

22:54.710 --> 22:57.278
'Cause whether you like it
or not, we're in this together.

22:57.280 --> 22:59.946
All of us.

22:59.948 --> 23:01.981
So if you guys wanna try
to find a way to beat this,

23:01.983 --> 23:04.083
we need all hands on deck.

23:04.085 --> 23:07.053
Okay. Remind me
what happened.

23:07.055 --> 23:09.722
Okay, so when
I woke up down here,

23:09.724 --> 23:11.724
I felt like I was standing
in the right place.

23:11.726 --> 23:13.927
Like someone had led me
here for a reason.

23:13.929 --> 23:17.629
Miranda visits Caleb.
Maybe she's in your dreams, too.

23:19.265 --> 23:21.233
Uh, maybe we should
just look around.

23:31.110 --> 23:32.944
We know Joe's vault
used to be the bank, right?

23:32.946 --> 23:35.746
Yeah, it was
the Ravenswood savings & loan.

23:35.748 --> 23:38.916
It was the first bank
on main street, built in 1918.

23:38.918 --> 23:41.585
How do you guys
know these things?

23:41.587 --> 23:43.687
It was relocated to
the first mall in Ravenswood.

23:43.689 --> 23:46.924
I wrote a paper about it when the
new mall became the old mall.

23:46.926 --> 23:51.828
Once again we're talking about the year
original Miranda and original Caleb died.

23:51.830 --> 23:53.730
You mean the year
they were murdered.

23:58.102 --> 23:59.269
So you believe it now?

23:59.271 --> 24:01.271
That they died
because of the curse?

24:02.806 --> 24:06.175
I can't make it go away
unless I accept that it's real.

24:06.177 --> 24:09.644
So welcome to the new normal.

24:09.646 --> 24:11.981
Check this out.

24:14.217 --> 24:15.817
The drawing
that was in the box,

24:15.819 --> 24:18.387
it's not a map,
it's a blueprint.

24:18.389 --> 24:20.922
And it wasn't <i>signed</i> by S & L.

24:20.924 --> 24:23.457
It's the floor plan
<i>of</i> the S & L.

24:23.459 --> 24:25.994
We're standing in the basement
of the old savings and loan.

24:25.996 --> 24:27.628
I think you're right.

24:27.630 --> 24:29.797
(Chuckles)

24:33.235 --> 24:35.569
What?

24:35.571 --> 24:38.571
Are you surprised
to know where we are?

24:38.573 --> 24:40.507
Or that I figured it out?

24:40.509 --> 24:42.509
I think a little of both.

24:42.511 --> 24:44.811
I read more than
just style magazines.

24:46.381 --> 24:50.384
All right, so we're in
an old bank, but why?

24:50.386 --> 24:52.651
It's just a moldy old room.

24:52.653 --> 24:56.488
Yeah, but in the drawing
there were two rooms, not one.

24:57.991 --> 25:00.092
This was a doorway, not a wall.

25:00.094 --> 25:02.594
Guys, there's another room
behind here.

25:30.521 --> 25:32.489
You have to hurry.

25:46.203 --> 25:47.136
(Snips)

25:52.943 --> 25:53.691
Oh, my God.

26:20.216 --> 26:22.516
This wall was built
from the inside.

26:25.220 --> 26:27.288
They did this to themselves.

26:31.159 --> 26:34.829
It doesn't look like they brought
any food or water down here.

26:34.831 --> 26:38.264
It's because they didn't want to linger.
They came here to die.

26:42.669 --> 26:44.838
(Screams)

26:44.840 --> 26:45.838
A big hairy spider!

26:45.840 --> 26:47.840
It was crawling up my arm! Ugh!

26:47.842 --> 26:51.243
We're in a room with two skeletons
and that is what freaked you out?

26:51.245 --> 26:53.312
I hate spiders.

27:25.142 --> 27:28.011
This ring's identical to the one
that we found in Henry's box.

27:32.384 --> 27:35.251
I think this is a letter
from Miranda to Caleb.

27:35.253 --> 27:37.587
"My dearest Caleb..."

27:37.589 --> 27:40.990
It was only the day we met that I
understood the meaning of eternity.

27:44.728 --> 27:49.231
So on this day,
with our friends as witness,

27:49.233 --> 27:55.169
I promise to love,
honor, and cherish you.

27:56.739 --> 28:00.108
But not until death do us part.

28:00.110 --> 28:02.176
For eternity.

28:17.091 --> 28:20.193
I don't think these are letters.

28:20.195 --> 28:22.229
They're wedding vows.

28:27.635 --> 28:30.070
Caleb and Miranda were
married by a ship's Captain.

28:34.142 --> 28:36.109
Original Caleb
and original Miranda

28:36.111 --> 28:39.111
were killed
in a boating accident.

28:39.113 --> 28:40.479
With three of their friends.

28:42.950 --> 28:44.984
They died on their wedding day.

28:49.256 --> 28:51.257
Guys...

28:51.259 --> 28:53.059
There's stuff in here
about the curse.

28:56.495 --> 29:00.498
Their names
are Thomas and Esther.

29:00.500 --> 29:02.000
They thought if they
sacrificed themselves,

29:02.002 --> 29:03.969
they could bring Caleb
and Miranda back.

29:05.471 --> 29:07.805
And that Caleb and Miranda
could reverse the curse.

29:09.308 --> 29:11.741
You mean back to life?

29:11.743 --> 29:13.077
That's crazy.

29:13.079 --> 29:15.779
Is it possible it worked?
Their sacrifice?

29:18.416 --> 29:20.985
I don't think it's a coincidence
anymore that both you and Miranda

29:20.987 --> 29:25.356
look exactly like
your long lost relatives.

29:25.358 --> 29:26.655
Whoa, guys.

29:26.657 --> 29:28.424
I am not original Caleb.

29:28.426 --> 29:30.259
I'm me.

29:30.261 --> 29:33.329
Maybe you were original Caleb
and now you're back.

29:34.498 --> 29:37.000
Okay, I see where
you're going with this,

29:37.002 --> 29:38.601
but I'm not that guy.

29:38.603 --> 29:40.269
And Miranda is not that girl.

29:40.271 --> 29:42.637
When I met her on the bus,
my heart didn't go pitter-pat.

29:44.173 --> 29:48.343
I have a girlfriend
and I love her.

29:48.345 --> 29:50.345
Caleb, I don't know if I
believe in any of this stuff.

29:50.347 --> 29:52.680
But if these people were willing
to do this to themselves,

29:52.682 --> 29:55.717
they must have had some insight
into something we don't know.

29:55.719 --> 29:59.720
I mean, what if it's true?
What if you did know each other?

29:59.722 --> 30:02.223
Maybe then
we all don't have to die.

30:02.225 --> 30:04.725
Luke said they
brought them back

30:04.727 --> 30:07.395
so that they could
break the curse.

30:07.397 --> 30:10.197
Look, I am in this with you.

30:10.199 --> 30:12.366
And I want every one of us
to live through it.

30:12.368 --> 30:16.269
But I don't think that Miranda
and I are the chosen ones.

30:16.271 --> 30:17.370
Okay?

30:19.773 --> 30:21.741
She's just a girl that I met
on the bus a week ago.

30:21.743 --> 30:23.243
And now she's dead.

30:23.245 --> 30:24.777
Well, maybe that's part of it.

30:24.779 --> 30:27.347
Maybe we just found out
why she can't move on.

30:29.216 --> 30:31.816
(Sighs)

30:38.191 --> 30:40.025
This must be
original Miranda's house.

30:42.562 --> 30:44.229
Grunwald said she might be
looking for her family home.

30:44.231 --> 30:45.597
Maybe that's what she found.

30:45.599 --> 30:48.433
Isn't that the creepy
old house on saw mill road?

30:48.435 --> 30:50.101
The one we used to run by
when we were kids.

30:50.103 --> 30:51.536
We thought it was haunted.

30:55.574 --> 30:57.041
Who's driving?

31:17.095 --> 31:18.694
Okay, that's weird.

32:04.305 --> 32:06.305
Is it me or did it just drop,
like, 20 degrees in here?

32:06.307 --> 32:08.508
It's freezing in here.

32:08.510 --> 32:11.511
Looks like
they left hundred years ago

32:11.513 --> 32:12.811
in a hurry and never came back.

32:17.317 --> 32:19.018
How is this thing
still ticking?

32:19.020 --> 32:21.787
Don't you have to wind these?

32:24.257 --> 32:25.657
(Clock chiming)

32:25.659 --> 32:26.991
Okay, there's creepy,

32:26.993 --> 32:28.360
then there's if I pee my pants

32:28.362 --> 32:29.761
no one's allowed
to make fun of me.

32:29.763 --> 32:31.996
(Clock chiming)

32:41.439 --> 32:47.144
Miranda? Miranda!

32:50.515 --> 32:52.316
She didn't bring you here.

32:54.418 --> 32:55.652
I did.

32:58.021 --> 33:00.190
Do you know where Miranda is?

33:00.192 --> 33:02.659
She's waiting for you.

33:04.228 --> 33:06.563
(Deep voice) In hell.

33:06.565 --> 33:10.732
(Wind howls)

33:10.734 --> 33:13.502
(Laughs)

33:20.992 --> 33:23.392
It won't open! It's locked!

33:25.529 --> 33:26.729
Where did she go?

33:26.731 --> 33:27.997
I don't know what
that little girl is,

33:27.999 --> 33:30.533
but I know what she isn't,
and that is a human.

33:30.535 --> 33:32.935
Miranda!

33:32.937 --> 33:35.104
This is some kind of trap. Miranda
didn't bring us here. It did.

33:35.106 --> 33:36.672
We need to find a way out
before it comes back.

33:36.674 --> 33:39.207
I'm not leaving here
until we look for Miranda.

33:39.209 --> 33:41.176
You heard what Luke said.
This was a trap.

33:41.178 --> 33:42.277
Like I said...

33:45.714 --> 33:47.516
Everybody's sticking together.

33:47.518 --> 33:53.854
â™ª Ring around the Rosie â™ª

33:53.856 --> 33:59.593
â™ª pocket full of posies â™ª

33:59.595 --> 34:05.898
â™ª ashes, ashes â™ª

34:05.900 --> 34:10.036
â™ª we all fall down â™ª

34:11.871 --> 34:13.639
- Wanna play?
- (Gasps)

34:13.641 --> 34:15.141
(Laughs)

34:37.795 --> 34:39.797
Miranda!

34:39.799 --> 34:42.065
How are all of you here?

34:43.635 --> 34:45.436
Are you dead?

34:45.438 --> 34:47.103
Miranda, this is not heaven.

34:47.106 --> 34:49.138
They hijacked your thoughts
or something.

34:49.139 --> 34:51.940
You are seeing what you want to
see, not the truth of this place.

34:51.943 --> 34:54.844
What? No, Caleb,
my parents are here.

34:54.846 --> 34:57.681
They'll be right back.
You'll see them.

34:57.683 --> 34:59.015
She's coming!

35:00.718 --> 35:02.652
Miranda, how do we
get out of here?!

35:02.654 --> 35:05.020
(Loud banging)

35:05.022 --> 35:07.122
(Screams)

35:07.124 --> 35:09.858
(Rumbling)

35:09.860 --> 35:14.830
(Wind howls)

35:14.832 --> 35:16.565
You know how this is gonna end.

35:19.836 --> 35:21.469
What was that?

35:21.471 --> 35:23.070
((Groans)

35:23.072 --> 35:25.373
We gotta get out of here.

35:25.375 --> 35:27.775
(Screams)

35:27.777 --> 35:28.909
We gotta get out of here!

35:31.146 --> 35:33.948
In my dream, there was
a door in this closet.

35:35.217 --> 35:36.450
I think it's the way out.

35:43.291 --> 35:44.891
It's a pretty far drop.

35:44.893 --> 35:46.993
But if I go first,
I can help you guys.

35:48.730 --> 35:51.131
(Grunts)

35:51.133 --> 35:52.598
Come on.

35:53.800 --> 35:55.801
Remy, come on.

35:58.071 --> 36:00.706
Miranda, come on.
Let's go.

36:00.708 --> 36:02.742
I... I can't.

36:02.744 --> 36:06.211
Yes, you can.
Trust me. Please.

36:07.514 --> 36:09.414
This whole thing
was a trap, Miranda.

36:09.416 --> 36:11.383
Those things
are not your parents.

36:11.385 --> 36:13.485
They're like that thing
that you saw on the bridge.

36:13.487 --> 36:14.519
Olivia: Come on!
Hurry!

36:21.894 --> 36:24.195
You have to come with me,
Miranda.

36:24.197 --> 36:26.930
If we don't leave now, we can
never be together again.

36:32.437 --> 36:34.338
You see her, right?

36:34.340 --> 36:37.007
You see my mom?

36:40.711 --> 36:41.944
No.

36:50.187 --> 36:53.189
When I was three,

36:53.191 --> 36:56.425
you taught me
how to ride a bike.

36:56.427 --> 36:58.460
Do you remember that?

36:58.462 --> 37:02.197
Of course. It was such
a big moment for you.

37:09.138 --> 37:12.140
I never learned
how to ride a bike.

37:12.142 --> 37:15.242
My parents died
before they could teach me.

37:18.780 --> 37:21.549
It doesn't have to be real
for you to be happy.

37:21.551 --> 37:25.486
(Crying)

37:25.488 --> 37:26.987
Yes, it does.

37:26.989 --> 37:30.423
(Glass clinking)

37:30.425 --> 37:31.958
(Rumbling)

37:31.960 --> 37:34.160
(Wind howling)

38:02.755 --> 38:03.721
Come on, man. Come on.

38:06.192 --> 38:08.026
(Gasps)

38:09.328 --> 38:10.762
Caleb?

38:10.764 --> 38:12.764
Hey. Come on.

38:24.876 --> 38:26.777
I can feel you.

38:29.047 --> 38:31.648
How did we bring you back?

38:31.650 --> 38:35.084
You didn't.
You're with me now.

38:36.987 --> 38:38.221
I'm dead?

38:40.291 --> 38:43.159
I think there's still time
for you to go back.

38:47.965 --> 38:51.466
No, really, Caleb,
if you don't go back now...

38:51.468 --> 38:53.168
it's okay.

38:53.170 --> 38:54.469
I can't explain it,

38:54.471 --> 38:58.473
but it feels right
being here with you.

39:05.080 --> 39:07.748
It's not right yet,

39:07.750 --> 39:10.784
but I know it will be.

39:16.825 --> 39:18.125
(Sighs)

39:20.662 --> 39:22.829
(Flatline)

39:22.831 --> 39:23.830
(Beeping)

39:23.832 --> 39:25.365
Doctor: We have a heartbeat.

39:30.071 --> 39:31.904
Well, his vitals
are stabilizing,

39:31.906 --> 39:35.508
and he doesn't seem to have
any permanent injuries.

39:35.510 --> 39:37.270
It's a miracle after
taking a fall like that.

39:47.587 --> 39:49.554
I'm glad you called me.

39:53.026 --> 39:54.526
Will you stay
until he comes to?

39:56.729 --> 39:57.796
(Sighs)

40:11.376 --> 40:13.043
Well?

40:13.045 --> 40:15.513
They're still alive.

40:38.836 --> 40:42.004
Hey, how about some coffees
for everybody?

40:42.006 --> 40:44.205
That would be great.
Thanks, Dillon.

40:45.307 --> 40:46.474
I'll be right back.

40:46.476 --> 40:47.409
Okay.

41:37.791 --> 41:40.259
After all we did
to get them in that house.

41:42.996 --> 41:44.630
How did this happen?

41:44.632 --> 41:47.765
(Deep voice) Their connection
is stronger than I thought.

41:49.368 --> 41:51.603
He's gonna be very unhappy.

42:20.275 --> 42:25.444
