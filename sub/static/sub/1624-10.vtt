WEBVTT

00:01.333 --> 00:03.677
Oh, you look pretty sharp tonight, Earl.

00:03.797 --> 00:04.922
Going somewhere special?

00:05.042 --> 00:06.987
Max, I am free, black, and 75.

00:07.107 --> 00:09.067
Who knows what the night will bring?

00:10.737 --> 00:12.100
Well, here's a twenty.

00:12.220 --> 00:14.106
Can you break this the way
you just broke my heart?

00:14.643 --> 00:16.341
Pop-pop.

00:18.173 --> 00:19.374
Look at all this.

00:19.494 --> 00:21.015
People really tipped us well tonight.

00:21.135 --> 00:22.406
Yeah, well, don't get used to it.

00:22.526 --> 00:24.755
Thanksgiving is almost here,
and as soon as people realize

00:24.875 --> 00:25.795
how much money they have to spend

00:25.797 --> 00:28.081
on holiday gifts, their
wallets snap tighter

00:28.083 --> 00:32.469
than Kim Kardashian's legs after
the wedding check cleared.

00:32.470 --> 00:34.420
I've always loved this time of year...

00:34.422 --> 00:38.191
spiced pumpkin lattes,
bringing my winter furs out,

00:38.193 --> 00:39.526
then bringing my winter furs

00:39.528 --> 00:41.945
to the dry cleaner's to get
the red peta paint out.

00:41.947 --> 00:45.598
For me, it was jumping
into a pile of leaves

00:45.600 --> 00:49.536
and finding a used condom.

00:50.772 --> 00:53.156
What's up, children of the corn?

00:53.158 --> 00:56.543
I will stay tonight and decorate diner

00:56.545 --> 00:58.995
for American holiday of Thanksgiving.

00:58.997 --> 01:02.082
Wow. I'm surprised you got the
right holiday decorations.

01:02.084 --> 01:04.950
Last month, you put out Easter
bunnies for Yom Kippur.

01:04.953 --> 01:08.838
So many Jewish holidays, I
cannot Wikipedia them all.

01:08.840 --> 01:12.309
What, like I don't got a life?

01:12.311 --> 01:14.761
â™ª Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh â™ª

01:22.320 --> 01:24.237
My father and I had a very special

01:24.239 --> 01:25.488
Thanksgiving tradition every year.

01:25.490 --> 01:26.823
Oh, let me guess.

01:26.825 --> 01:29.409
You'd fly someplace like the
Bahamas, lay by the pool,

01:29.411 --> 01:32.112
and he'd light other people's
stolen money on fire?

01:32.114 --> 01:34.781
No. We'd rent out the
Waldorf Astoria ballrooms

01:34.783 --> 01:36.082
and feed the homeless.

01:36.084 --> 01:38.985
Don't look at me right now.

01:38.987 --> 01:41.171
And after, we'd fly down
to our home in St. Barts

01:41.173 --> 01:42.155
for two weeks.

01:42.157 --> 01:43.790
Okay, you can look at me again.

01:43.792 --> 01:47.127
I stayed at the Waldorf Astoria once...

01:47.129 --> 01:48.595
beautiful hotel.

01:48.597 --> 01:50.463
$50 for a hamburger?

01:50.465 --> 01:53.216
For that money, it should eat me first.

01:53.218 --> 01:57.637
Okay, ready to go?

01:57.639 --> 01:59.556
Han, if you'd really like to
do something in the diner

01:59.558 --> 02:01.274
to honor the spirit of Thanksgiving,

02:01.276 --> 02:02.859
you can open your doors
and feed the homeless.

02:02.861 --> 02:05.312
Yeah, put your money
where your cornstalk is.

02:06.097 --> 02:07.847
Caroline and I will work for free.

02:07.849 --> 02:10.233
Isn't it enough that when
I see them on the street,

02:10.235 --> 02:13.019
I smile and pretend
to fumble for change?

02:13.021 --> 02:15.322
No, it isn't.

02:15.324 --> 02:17.690
You can afford to open
the diner for one night.

02:17.692 --> 02:20.243
You can't put a price tag on
those kind of emotional rewards.

02:20.245 --> 02:23.363
Yes, I can. $18 for 16-pound turkey,

02:23.365 --> 02:25.215
and I will need many of them.

02:25.217 --> 02:27.050
There...price tag.

02:27.052 --> 02:30.420
Here, I will pay for turkeys.

02:30.422 --> 02:31.871
Jeez, dude, where'd you get that?

02:31.873 --> 02:33.706
I sell cigarettes from New Hampshire

02:33.708 --> 02:35.842
to schoolkids in New York.

02:35.844 --> 02:38.228
It is a good profit and beautiful drive.

02:38.230 --> 02:40.397
I love the leaves.

02:40.399 --> 02:42.182
All right.

02:42.184 --> 02:45.769
I'm feeling y'all. I'll bring the pie.

02:45.771 --> 02:48.021
My mother used to make
the best chocolate pie.

02:48.023 --> 02:49.322
I remember one time she got so mad

02:49.324 --> 02:50.690
at this white woman she worked for,

02:50.692 --> 02:52.942
she took this chocolate
pie into the bathroom...

02:52.944 --> 02:55.678
<i>No, hold up. That was from the help.</i>

02:59.367 --> 03:02.452
I know it's not Burberry
like we're used to,

03:02.454 --> 03:04.788
but I'm telling you,
used moving blankets

03:04.790 --> 03:06.256
are gonna be in this year.

03:06.258 --> 03:08.541
Who's a trendsetter?

03:08.543 --> 03:11.661
We're really lucky November is so warm.

03:11.663 --> 03:14.097
Another thing I'm giving thanks
for this Thanksgiving...

03:14.099 --> 03:15.598
global warming.

03:15.600 --> 03:19.803
I think the three remaining
polar bears would disagree.

03:19.805 --> 03:22.272
Max, it's time to teach me how to bake.

03:22.274 --> 03:23.523
Okay, well, if we're doing that,

03:23.525 --> 03:25.141
first I have to go get baked.

03:25.143 --> 03:27.093
I'm serious.

03:27.095 --> 03:28.761
It's the beginning of
the holiday season,

03:28.763 --> 03:30.780
and with all the potential
Christmas cupcakes

03:30.782 --> 03:32.148
and festive gift baskets,

03:32.150 --> 03:33.983
you're gonna need as much
help as you can get.

03:33.985 --> 03:36.602
Festive holiday gift baskets?

03:36.604 --> 03:37.570
No way.

03:37.572 --> 03:38.822
I'm not into all that crap.

03:38.824 --> 03:40.440
Oh, no. Are you gonna be one of those,

03:40.442 --> 03:42.492
"I am too cool to believe in
the wonders of Christmas"

03:42.494 --> 03:44.127
type of bitches?

03:44.129 --> 03:47.613
I am so many types of bitches,

03:47.615 --> 03:48.882
I've lost count.

03:48.884 --> 03:53.002
And the only wonder of
Christmas I'm aware of is...

03:53.004 --> 03:55.138
I wonder how you're gonna
keep up that attitude

03:55.140 --> 03:56.473
through Christmas this year.

03:56.475 --> 03:59.142
Why, because this is my first
holiday without any money?

03:59.144 --> 04:01.511
Uh, yeah.

04:01.513 --> 04:02.679
Money isn't what makes

04:02.681 --> 04:05.081
the holidays special, Max.

04:05.083 --> 04:06.816
Uh, yeah.

04:06.818 --> 04:09.135
The holidays are totally about money.

04:09.137 --> 04:10.803
It's about spending money to buy things

04:10.805 --> 04:13.273
to stuff into the giant
black sucking hole

04:13.275 --> 04:14.941
in the center of each
of us that reminds us

04:14.943 --> 04:18.111
life is hard and then we die.

04:18.113 --> 04:20.697
And that's my Christmas card.

04:20.699 --> 04:23.950
Max, I'm aware this holiday
season will be challenging,

04:23.952 --> 04:25.651
will I miss my 20-foot Christmas tree

04:25.653 --> 04:28.154
decorated by ten gay men? Yes.

04:28.156 --> 04:29.923
Will I miss those ten gay men

04:29.925 --> 04:33.826
outing my cousin Steven
before he was ready? No.

04:33.828 --> 04:35.712
My holiday spirit is
bigger than my money.

04:35.714 --> 04:37.096
So come on, teach me how to bake.

04:37.098 --> 04:38.264
We only have a couple weeks.

04:38.266 --> 04:41.100
Fine. Pour a cup of milk into the mixer.

04:41.102 --> 04:42.452
This will be fun.

04:42.454 --> 04:44.888
When I was little, I used
to make my father cakes

04:44.890 --> 04:46.756
in my easy-bake oven.

04:46.758 --> 04:49.859
My easy-bake oven was repossessed.

04:49.861 --> 04:54.197
So, um, speaking of your
father, are you doing okay?

04:54.199 --> 04:55.448
I mean, this is a hard time of year

04:55.450 --> 04:57.484
for people who have
feelings, and just...

04:57.486 --> 05:00.119
With your father in prison,
how are you doing?

05:00.121 --> 05:01.538
I'm doing great.

05:01.540 --> 05:03.623
I actually just found out
that since it's Thanksgiving,

05:03.625 --> 05:05.792
they're allowing me to come
see him for the first time.

05:05.794 --> 05:07.844
Well, that excitement
will probably taper off

05:07.846 --> 05:10.246
after the full-body cavity search.

05:10.248 --> 05:11.915
I don't know. I might like it.

05:11.917 --> 05:15.218
It's been a while since I've
had any cavities searched.

05:15.220 --> 05:18.704
All right. Pour the milk, slut.

05:21.058 --> 05:23.092
One cup milk.

05:23.094 --> 05:24.143
There, how's that?

05:24.145 --> 05:25.094
Good.

05:25.096 --> 05:29.382
Now into the mixer.

05:29.384 --> 05:30.716
There, how was that?

05:30.718 --> 05:32.519
Uh-uh. We're not playing

05:32.521 --> 05:35.822
"Rich girl gets a trophy every
time she does something normal"

05:35.824 --> 05:37.440
Just cover the bowl with the towel

05:37.442 --> 05:39.325
so it doesn't splash
out, and turn it on.

05:41.028 --> 05:42.161
Oh, it's not plugged in.

05:42.163 --> 05:44.948
Oh. Right.

05:44.950 --> 05:47.884
No, not without the towel!

05:50.738 --> 05:54.424
Christmas comes but once a year,

05:54.426 --> 05:57.377
and I think it just did.

06:02.600 --> 06:05.502
Wow. These high-end mixers
are a lot of money.

06:05.504 --> 06:07.254
I thought if we came to
a big department store,

06:07.256 --> 06:09.172
there'd be a lot of them, and
the prices would be better.

06:09.174 --> 06:10.207
We can't afford these.

06:10.209 --> 06:12.042
How much did you think they'd be?

06:12.044 --> 06:13.426
I don't know.

06:13.428 --> 06:15.428
I guess I'm not used
to looking at prices.

06:15.430 --> 06:18.815
I usually just point,
pout, and it's purchased.

06:18.817 --> 06:21.268
Yeah, I had a version of
that, only it was more like,

06:21.270 --> 06:22.936
point, and when they look the other way,

06:22.938 --> 06:25.438
stuff steaks down your pants and run.

06:25.440 --> 06:28.057
Come on, there has to be a
mixer here we can afford.

06:28.059 --> 06:30.860
There is.

06:30.862 --> 06:32.562
Here.

06:32.564 --> 06:35.582
A $5 spoon? That's what we can afford?

06:35.584 --> 06:38.952
Yeah, if we put it on layaway,
work hard for a few years.

06:38.954 --> 06:40.837
I'm used to being poor
around your stuff,

06:40.839 --> 06:43.173
but not around stuff that I want.

06:43.175 --> 06:45.375
What happened to all your
"money's not important"

06:45.377 --> 06:46.543
holiday spirit now?

06:46.545 --> 06:48.211
Max, it feels like you want me

06:48.213 --> 06:49.912
to be depressed about the holidays.

06:49.914 --> 06:52.098
No, no. I'm just saying
that it's okay for you

06:52.100 --> 06:53.516
not to be all up and
everything around me

06:53.518 --> 06:54.684
if you're not feeling it.

06:54.686 --> 06:56.469
It's all right to let
your dark side out.

06:56.471 --> 06:58.855
Come to the dark side.

06:58.857 --> 07:00.607
Oh, my God.

07:00.609 --> 07:02.425
Look, they're hiring elves.

07:02.427 --> 07:03.760
Why would I go to the dark side

07:03.762 --> 07:05.895
when I could go to Santaworld?

07:05.897 --> 07:08.448
Let's go get in line.
I've always loved Santaworld.

07:08.450 --> 07:10.600
Me too, as a David Sedaris story,

07:10.602 --> 07:12.068
not as an actual real-life option.

07:12.070 --> 07:13.320
Come on.

07:13.322 --> 07:15.438
If we get hired, we could
use our employee discount

07:15.440 --> 07:17.958
to get one of the really
good cake mixers.

07:17.960 --> 07:20.076
And then it'd be like
it came from Santa!

07:20.078 --> 07:22.945
Come on, Max, we'd be great elves.

07:22.947 --> 07:25.465
I have the holiday spirit.
You're great with kids.

07:25.467 --> 07:27.417
And we're both so desperate for money,

07:27.419 --> 07:29.952
we'll wear other people's tights.

07:29.954 --> 07:32.138
Max, I've been coming to
this store at Christmastime

07:32.140 --> 07:33.923
with my father since I was little.

07:33.925 --> 07:36.593
I'd get all dressed up in my
fanciest winter coat and hat

07:36.595 --> 07:38.728
and then stand in line to see Santa

07:38.730 --> 07:41.097
with my hands in my muff.

07:46.103 --> 07:50.106
And they didn't throw you out?

07:50.108 --> 07:53.243
There is nothing Christmas-y
about this hallway.

07:53.245 --> 07:55.445
It looks like the place Santa
sends promiscuous elves

07:55.447 --> 07:58.365
to get the results of their S.T.D. test.

07:58.367 --> 08:00.500
Okay, that's the kind of comment

08:00.502 --> 08:02.452
that almost got us knocked
out of the first round.

08:02.454 --> 08:04.371
You're lucky I edited your application.

08:04.373 --> 08:05.789
Why, what was so bad?

08:05.791 --> 08:09.492
You requested to work in
Santa's sex toy shop.

08:09.494 --> 08:10.877
Max, that's not even a thing.

08:10.879 --> 08:14.097
Tell that to my
candy-cane-shaped vibrator.

08:14.099 --> 08:16.883
Max!

08:16.885 --> 08:21.003
I call it "Santa's big helper."

08:21.005 --> 08:23.606
Please try and get into
the holiday spirit.

08:23.608 --> 08:24.974
I know. If we get hired,

08:24.976 --> 08:27.694
<i>we'll go right home and watch
Miracle on 34th Street.</i>

08:27.696 --> 08:29.813
It'll be a miracle on 34th Street

08:29.815 --> 08:32.014
if we make it out of the
bottom of this slave ship

08:32.015 --> 08:34.234
without elf scurvy.

08:34.236 --> 08:35.902
Hi.

08:35.904 --> 08:39.289
<i>I couldn't help but overhear you
mention Miracle on 34th Street.</i>

08:39.291 --> 08:41.457
That's my absolute
favorite Christmas movie.

08:41.460 --> 08:42.708
Mine too!

08:42.711 --> 08:44.911
<i>My second favorite is
It's A Wonderful Life.</i>

08:44.913 --> 08:46.162
Mine too!

08:46.164 --> 08:49.198
<i>I've got Schindler's List on Blu-Ray.</i>

08:52.086 --> 08:55.004
- Hi. I'm Mary.
- I'm Caroline.

08:55.006 --> 08:56.389
Hi. I'm Mary.

08:56.391 --> 08:58.641
It's cool. We don't need to talk.

08:58.643 --> 09:00.977
That's Max. She's kind of
a Grinch about Christmas.

09:00.979 --> 09:02.929
Oh, like my brother Patrick...

09:02.931 --> 09:05.432
He's always teasing me
about loving Christmas.

09:05.434 --> 09:08.568
He calls me "Mary Christmas."

09:08.570 --> 09:10.520
Get it?

09:10.522 --> 09:13.156
It's 'cause my name is Mary.

09:13.158 --> 09:14.891
I can't help it.

09:14.893 --> 09:16.860
It's my favorite time of year.

09:16.862 --> 09:18.778
- Mine too.
- Yo.

09:18.780 --> 09:21.414
Disconnect before it's too late.

09:21.416 --> 09:23.783
Don't be so cynical.

09:23.785 --> 09:25.085
Especially Christmas Eve.

09:25.087 --> 09:27.403
It's an O'Brien family tradition.

09:27.405 --> 09:29.005
All seven of my sisters and brothers...

09:29.007 --> 09:32.008
we line up on the staircase in
our brand-new Christmas PJ's

09:32.010 --> 09:33.176
and have our picture taken.

09:33.178 --> 09:36.513
Bitch is 30.

09:39.851 --> 09:41.918
It's my father.

09:41.920 --> 09:44.420
Hi, Daddy. You'll never guess
where I am right now...

09:44.422 --> 09:47.307
applying for a job at Santaworld.

09:47.309 --> 09:49.309
No, it's not depressing at all.

09:49.311 --> 09:53.363
The man's in prison, and he
thinks this is depressing.

09:53.365 --> 09:56.282
Oh. Are you sure?

09:56.284 --> 09:59.786
It's really not that far.

09:59.788 --> 10:02.956
Okay. If that's what you want.

10:02.958 --> 10:06.609
Call me on Thanksgiving. Love you.

10:06.611 --> 10:08.545
He thought about it and
doesn't want me to come.

10:08.547 --> 10:10.797
He said he can't face
having me see him in there.

10:10.799 --> 10:13.883
- You okay?
- Fine.

10:13.885 --> 10:16.285
Quiet, please, people.
I have an announcement.

10:16.287 --> 10:19.839
Everyone in this corridor has
been chosen to be an elf.

10:19.841 --> 10:21.174
<i>Mazel.</i>

10:21.176 --> 10:23.292
Yay, we're elves.

10:23.294 --> 10:26.062
Report to work at 3:00 A.M.
the morning of Black Friday.

10:28.232 --> 10:29.315
Ooh!

10:29.317 --> 10:31.100
This is so exciting!

10:31.102 --> 10:33.570
â™ª Fa-la-la-la-la la-la-la-la â™ª

10:33.572 --> 10:34.904
Okay, well...

10:34.906 --> 10:37.023
- I'll see you both then.
- Okay, Mary.

10:37.025 --> 10:39.492
Great, 3:00 A.M...

10:39.494 --> 10:43.580
you, me, and definitely-a-Virgin-Mary.

10:50.219 --> 10:52.353
Good night. Get home safely.

10:52.355 --> 10:56.107
Ooh. Maybe I should not
have said that to homeless.

10:56.109 --> 10:57.358
That is it.

10:57.360 --> 10:59.477
2:00 A.M... Freebie Thanksgiving dinner

10:59.479 --> 11:00.945
is now officially over.

11:00.947 --> 11:02.446
According to my calculations,

11:02.448 --> 11:04.749
we served over 300 turkey dinners

11:04.751 --> 11:06.651
and only had two knife fights.

11:06.653 --> 11:08.736
Thank you, Caroline.

11:08.738 --> 11:11.122
This experience taught
me that rich or poor,

11:11.124 --> 11:14.659
home or homeless, we are all the same.

11:14.661 --> 11:16.544
Wait. Where's my wallet?

11:16.546 --> 11:19.330
They took my wallet,
those dirty sons of...

11:19.332 --> 11:21.799
Oh, here it is.

11:21.801 --> 11:24.802
Yes, we are all the same.

11:24.804 --> 11:27.972
Well, I have two things to say.

11:27.974 --> 11:30.391
First of all, I'm incredibly proud of us

11:30.393 --> 11:32.143
for spreading the spirit
of Thanksgiving together.

11:32.145 --> 11:35.629
And secondly, someone left an
adult diaper in this booth,

11:35.631 --> 11:38.816
and I am not dealing with that.

11:40.519 --> 11:42.136
What's with the sad face?

11:42.138 --> 11:43.637
You saw the bathroom?

11:43.639 --> 11:46.140
It's just...
even though we fed the homeless,

11:46.142 --> 11:47.975
it doesn't feel like
Thanksgiving without my father.

11:47.977 --> 11:50.161
But you made a lot of
people happy here tonight,

11:50.163 --> 11:51.696
and you should feel
pretty good about that.

11:51.698 --> 11:54.448
- Yes, I do.
- Come on, elf.

11:54.450 --> 11:55.616
We better clear these tables.

11:55.618 --> 11:57.168
We have to be at Santaland in an hour.

11:57.170 --> 11:59.670
Why you have to be there in
the middle of the night?

11:59.672 --> 12:02.006
Because it's Black Friday, and
the doors open at 5:00 A.M.

12:02.008 --> 12:03.791
Yeah, we want to be there right on time

12:03.793 --> 12:06.427
to see the first person
trampled to death by UGGs.

12:06.429 --> 12:07.845
We have to work

12:07.847 --> 12:09.764
all night and then all day tomorrow.

12:09.766 --> 12:12.934
- How are we gonna do this?
- I got the answer right here.

12:12.936 --> 12:15.002
Max, I'm not doing cocaine.

12:15.004 --> 12:18.973
If we could afford cocaine,
we could afford a mixer.

12:18.975 --> 12:23.010
Nine-hour energy shots, aka elf juice.

12:23.012 --> 12:24.695
I've never done these. Do they work?

12:24.697 --> 12:26.447
Millions of wired-off-their-asses

12:26.449 --> 12:28.199
college students can't be wrong.

12:28.201 --> 12:31.369
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

12:31.371 --> 12:33.354
Did you just drink that whole thing?

12:33.356 --> 12:34.455
Yeah, why?

12:34.457 --> 12:36.457
Nothing.

12:36.459 --> 12:37.691
I'm sure it's not too much.

12:37.693 --> 12:40.294
They suggest sipping it, but...

12:40.296 --> 12:41.379
Who are they?

12:41.381 --> 12:42.880
All right, we'd better go.

12:42.882 --> 12:45.967
We got to go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go, go.

12:45.969 --> 12:49.203
Oh, you should've sipped it.

12:49.205 --> 12:50.554
How do I look?

12:50.556 --> 12:53.958
Because I kind of feel like I
look like a North Pole dancer.

12:53.960 --> 12:55.726
You actually look cute.
You look good in red...

12:55.728 --> 12:57.044
And green... red and green together.

12:57.046 --> 12:58.879
You can pull off anything.
You're so beautiful.

12:58.881 --> 13:01.399
- I don't tell you that enough.
- Whoa!

13:01.401 --> 13:03.484
Whoa, slow down, speed racer.

13:03.486 --> 13:04.885
I know. I can't stop talking.

13:04.887 --> 13:06.237
What was in that stuff you gave me?

13:06.239 --> 13:09.323
I don't know.
The ingredients are in Spanish.

13:09.325 --> 13:13.227
<i>Well, my corazon is beating muy rapido.</i>

13:13.229 --> 13:15.562
Okay, and why aren't you
in your elf costume yet?

13:15.564 --> 13:17.281
Because I was talking to
those people over there,

13:17.283 --> 13:19.166
and there's a chance...
a slight chance, but a chance...

13:19.168 --> 13:20.918
I could get moved to the
strolling Christmas carolers.

13:20.920 --> 13:22.837
I overheard their ethnic mix
is short a token blond.

13:22.839 --> 13:25.456
And I'm blond, baby!

13:25.458 --> 13:30.077
Forget it. You got me into the
underbelly of the elf beast,

13:30.079 --> 13:31.262
and you are not bailing on me.

13:31.264 --> 13:33.547
But those period costumes
are so much prettier.

13:33.549 --> 13:34.632
I will knock you from here

13:34.634 --> 13:36.550
to Rudolph's house if you abandon me.

13:36.552 --> 13:38.252
We are in this together.
Now go get your bells on.

13:38.254 --> 13:39.720
Okay, I didn't want to tell you this

13:39.722 --> 13:41.806
because it's, well,
gross, but the last elf

13:41.808 --> 13:43.691
who had the tights they gave
me, well, let's just say

13:43.693 --> 13:47.228
her little lady elf friend
visited unexpectedly.

13:47.230 --> 13:50.865
Ew. Talk about a period costume.

13:50.867 --> 13:53.901
You're right. It's disgusting.

13:53.903 --> 13:55.236
I can't do this anymore.

13:55.238 --> 13:57.321
I'm leaving.
I don't want to do this anymore.

13:57.323 --> 14:00.041
I feel tired and wired at the same time.

14:00.043 --> 14:03.377
This was an awful, awful,
awful, awful, awful idea!

14:03.379 --> 14:04.545
All right, calm down!

14:04.547 --> 14:07.882
Jeez, you're like a
Christmas crack monkey.

14:07.884 --> 14:10.051
Look, we are not going anywhere, okay?

14:10.053 --> 14:12.586
You got me all elfed up, and
now we need these jobs.

14:12.588 --> 14:13.888
So just go talk to someone

14:13.890 --> 14:15.639
and tell them why you need
a new pair of tights.

14:15.641 --> 14:17.641
I can't. It's embarrassing.

14:17.643 --> 14:20.895
Look, either you ask her,
or you rip out the crotch

14:20.897 --> 14:24.065
and risk showing six-year-olds
your winter wonderland.

14:24.067 --> 14:26.767
Now I'm sad.

14:26.769 --> 14:28.302
You, the one with the dark hair,

14:28.304 --> 14:29.820
- I need you to come with me.
- Where?

14:29.822 --> 14:32.023
And is there a drug test involved?

14:32.025 --> 14:35.142
Change of plans.
I need for you to be Mrs. Claus.

14:35.144 --> 14:37.945
The other one had to leave...
blamed menopause.

14:37.947 --> 14:39.663
Menopause, please.

14:39.665 --> 14:42.533
I had my uterus yanked
out on my lunch hour,

14:42.535 --> 14:45.753
and I was back at my desk by 2:00.

14:46.872 --> 14:48.155
Follow me...

14:48.157 --> 14:51.092
Unless, uh, you don't want
that extra $2 an hour.

14:51.094 --> 14:53.544
Oh, no.
You are not leaving me here alone

14:53.546 --> 14:55.179
when I'm crashing on elf juice.

14:55.181 --> 14:56.797
If I can't be an old-timey singer,

14:56.799 --> 14:58.049
you can't be Mrs. Claus.

14:58.051 --> 14:59.934
Well, I'm sorry, but I'm throwing you

14:59.936 --> 15:02.002
under the sled, sister.

15:02.004 --> 15:04.004
That extra $2 an hour
will bring us closer

15:04.006 --> 15:05.356
to the really good mixer.

15:05.358 --> 15:07.691
And the way my life is going,
this might be my only chance

15:07.693 --> 15:10.010
to be married to a rich guy.

15:11.813 --> 15:16.117
I'd double-check those
tights if I were you.

15:24.039 --> 15:25.907
Ugh.

15:25.909 --> 15:28.910
These tights suck.

15:28.912 --> 15:31.546
Hi. Hi, Elf.

15:31.548 --> 15:33.548
I just got assigned to the
front of the line with you.

15:33.550 --> 15:35.783
Oh, crap.

15:35.785 --> 15:37.468
It's me, Mary.

15:37.470 --> 15:40.889
"Mary Christmas." You know, like...

15:40.891 --> 15:43.207
- My brother Patrick always says.
- Yeah, you said that.

15:43.209 --> 15:46.094
Look at how cute we look...Jingles!

15:46.096 --> 15:48.847
I just named you Jingles.

15:48.849 --> 15:50.815
Get it? 'Cause of all your bells.

15:50.817 --> 15:52.267
Oh, listen...

15:52.269 --> 15:56.187
Ah, this is my number-one
favorite Christmas song.

15:56.189 --> 15:57.939
Ooh! What's your
favorite Christmas song?

15:57.941 --> 16:02.059
<i>Silent Night. Get it?
'Cause I want you to be silent.</i>

16:02.061 --> 16:04.395
What's the matter with you?

16:04.397 --> 16:08.065
You're acting like an elfhole.

16:08.067 --> 16:11.235
Oh, hello, children!

16:11.237 --> 16:13.338
Who's next to see my husband, Santa?

16:13.340 --> 16:15.290
I am so mad at you right now.

16:15.292 --> 16:17.091
Oh-ho-ho!

16:17.093 --> 16:18.960
Uh, hold on, children.

16:18.962 --> 16:21.078
Mrs. Claus is just having an issue

16:21.080 --> 16:22.714
with one of her elf employees.

16:22.716 --> 16:24.465
What are you doing?
What's wrong with you?

16:24.467 --> 16:25.884
You abandon me on Christmas

16:25.886 --> 16:28.770
the day after my father
abandons me on Thanksgiving?

16:28.772 --> 16:29.854
You have balls.

16:29.856 --> 16:32.106
Christmas balls...

16:32.108 --> 16:34.225
Like on Santa's tree...

16:34.227 --> 16:36.477
Or a Hanukkah bush.

16:36.479 --> 16:38.730
Look, I've got my own problems, okay?

16:38.732 --> 16:40.932
Santa is kind of hands-y.

16:40.934 --> 16:43.484
And you leave me here with this one

16:43.486 --> 16:44.986
when I'm coming down the bad side

16:44.988 --> 16:46.604
of nine-hour energy mountain?

16:46.606 --> 16:48.206
I don't know what's at
the bottom, but so far,

16:48.208 --> 16:50.408
not the miracle on 34th
Street I was hoping for.

16:50.410 --> 16:52.627
- Well, elf...
- Her name is Jingles.

16:52.629 --> 16:56.381
One more word, Mary, seriously.

16:56.383 --> 16:59.601
Listen, Bi-polar Express,

16:59.603 --> 17:01.552
you need to jingle all the
way up that mountain,

17:01.554 --> 17:04.722
because all these kids
are looking at us.

17:04.723 --> 17:07.141
Hello!

17:07.143 --> 17:09.928
- You got your list for Santa?
- Yep. Got it right here.

17:09.930 --> 17:11.913
Well, he's waiting for you,
so go right ahead in.

17:11.915 --> 17:14.816
- Yay, let's go!
- Hi.

17:14.818 --> 17:17.234
Oh, you look so pretty in
your hat and your coat.

17:17.237 --> 17:18.636
Thank you very much.

17:18.637 --> 17:20.905
I used to have a coat like that.

17:20.906 --> 17:25.359
But she gave it to a reindeer
because he was very cold.

17:25.362 --> 17:27.744
Oh, you have your list for Santa?

17:27.747 --> 17:28.830
Let's see what you want.

17:28.832 --> 17:31.749
- Ooh, a pretty doll...
- Had it.

17:31.751 --> 17:34.485
- An easy-bake oven...
- Had it.

17:34.487 --> 17:36.454
- A Barbie dream house.
- Oh, had that, too.

17:36.456 --> 17:39.490
Had all those things, and
now I have nothing...

17:39.492 --> 17:42.159
- nothing to stick in my big hole.
- Okay.

17:42.161 --> 17:45.546
- Jingles, what are you doing?
- Tell them, Max.

17:45.548 --> 17:48.933
No, no. I'm not Max. I'm Mrs. Claus...

17:48.935 --> 17:52.587
Mrs. Beyonce Claus...

17:52.589 --> 17:54.472
and I'm married to Santa.

17:54.474 --> 17:56.891
No, tell them what you told me...

17:56.893 --> 18:00.111
that it's all just stuff we buy
to stick in our big holes.

18:00.113 --> 18:02.447
I've been married for 50 years.

18:02.449 --> 18:04.515
I don't even think about holes anymore.

18:04.517 --> 18:07.685
Why is she talking to
children about holes?

18:07.687 --> 18:09.520
- I'll get her.
- Okay.

18:09.522 --> 18:12.023
- Caroline...
- No, Max, you were right.

18:12.025 --> 18:13.324
They should know the truth.

18:13.326 --> 18:16.244
Mrs. Claus, have a
little, uh, elf control.

18:16.246 --> 18:18.663
Jingles, come into my little house.

18:18.665 --> 18:21.449
No, Max. They should know.

18:21.451 --> 18:23.701
There is no miracle on 34th Street,

18:23.703 --> 18:25.503
and it's not such a wonderful life.

18:25.505 --> 18:27.088
If it were, I wouldn't be standing here

18:27.090 --> 18:29.557
in crotchless tights in
the middle of Santaland,

18:29.559 --> 18:32.176
with a father in prison,
too broke to buy a mixer.

18:32.178 --> 18:33.761
Stop it, you're gonna ruin Christmas.

18:33.763 --> 18:35.963
Christmas is all about money.

18:35.965 --> 18:38.016
If you want stuff from
Santa, you got to buy it,

18:38.018 --> 18:41.719
because there is no...

18:45.908 --> 18:48.776
Merry Christmas!

18:50.245 --> 18:52.747
Get her out of here now.

18:52.749 --> 18:55.867
And you, put your knees together!

18:59.621 --> 19:01.072
I hope I didn't ruin Christmas

19:01.074 --> 19:03.658
- for all those sweet children.
- No, you didn't.

19:03.660 --> 19:06.511
All they saw was a
crotchless elf freaking out.

19:06.513 --> 19:10.431
But "Mary Christmas" will never recover.

19:11.583 --> 19:13.634
They'll find her in her
studio apartment in two weeks

19:13.636 --> 19:16.137
hung from the chimney with care.

19:16.139 --> 19:18.356
Well, this is all kind of your fault.

19:18.358 --> 19:20.108
You told me to come to the dark side.

19:20.110 --> 19:22.143
I just told you to get in
touch with your feelings.

19:22.145 --> 19:24.729
I didn't think you'd turn
into Darth Caroline.

19:24.731 --> 19:26.614
Once I went there, I couldn't get back.

19:26.616 --> 19:29.233
Yeah, and chugging that
elf juice didn't help.

19:29.235 --> 19:30.434
It wasn't just the drink.

19:30.436 --> 19:32.570
Before those presents
came crashing down on me,

19:32.572 --> 19:33.571
reality did.

19:33.573 --> 19:35.957
I have no money and a father in prison

19:35.959 --> 19:37.992
who didn't even want to
see me on Thanksgiving.

19:37.994 --> 19:41.129
Yeah, well, there are a lot of
people way worse off than you.

19:41.131 --> 19:42.446
Yes, your father's in prison,

19:42.448 --> 19:45.433
but at least you have one
and you know where he is.

19:45.435 --> 19:47.785
And you have a home and a job.

19:47.787 --> 19:51.372
And you have a freaking horse.

19:52.474 --> 19:54.392
So...

19:54.394 --> 19:57.795
Happy holidays. It is a wonderful life.

19:57.797 --> 20:00.815
You're right. I am so lucky.

20:00.817 --> 20:04.352
Well, since right now is the
closest to the Christmas spirit

20:04.354 --> 20:05.770
we're probably gonna get,

20:05.772 --> 20:08.439
Santa wanted me to give you
your Christmas present now.

20:08.441 --> 20:11.242
It's our new mixer.

20:11.244 --> 20:13.995
We're gonna old-school it.

20:13.997 --> 20:17.365
Aw, you spooned me.

20:17.367 --> 20:19.617
I feel bad. I didn't get you anything.

20:19.619 --> 20:22.587
Max, you got me everything.

20:22.589 --> 20:25.489
Before you, I was living on
a subway, and now look...

20:25.491 --> 20:27.708
I'm living near a subway.

20:27.710 --> 20:29.260
So did you buy this?

20:29.262 --> 20:31.379
No, it's from Santa.

20:31.381 --> 20:34.882
Jingles, did you steal this?

20:34.884 --> 20:36.751
Yeah.

20:36.753 --> 20:39.020
I grabbed it when they
were throwing us out.

20:39.022 --> 20:40.521
Wow, Caroline Channing.

20:40.523 --> 20:42.673
You keep this up, and you
won't have to ask permission

20:42.675 --> 20:44.892
to visit your father in prison.

20:44.894 --> 20:47.228
But I did give $2 of
our cupcake-fund money

20:47.230 --> 20:49.013
to the Salvation Army Santa.

20:49.015 --> 20:52.366
So God bless us, everyone!
It's a wonderful life!

20:52.368 --> 20:55.653
It's times like this I
really miss Darth Caroline.
