00:01.914 --> 00:02.915
[instrumental music]

00:04.308 --> 00:06.528
[Jane]
Oh, it's lovely.

00:06.615 --> 00:07.920
[Lisbon]
It's a crime scene.

00:08.008 --> 00:09.661
[Patrick]
It's a lovely crime scene.

00:09.748 --> 00:11.489
[Rigsby]
Hey, couple joggers
found our John Doe

00:11.576 --> 00:12.534
on their morning run.

00:12.621 --> 00:13.839
Body's still pretty fresh.

00:13.926 --> 00:15.189
It must have happened
last night.

00:15.276 --> 00:17.365
No signs of an entry
or exit wound.

00:17.452 --> 00:19.410
It means cause was probably a
blunt force trauma to the head.

00:19.497 --> 00:21.064
And they brought
in the grown-ups

00:21.151 --> 00:22.805
because they couldn't
decide whose sandbox it was?

00:22.892 --> 00:24.546
Right, body's right
on the city line.

00:24.633 --> 00:26.069
'The only thing
they canagree on'

00:26.156 --> 00:28.028
'is that it was a carjacking
gone wrong.'

00:28.115 --> 00:29.899
Wallet, watch, wedding band,
everything gone.

00:32.162 --> 00:34.121
Oh, not everything.

00:34.208 --> 00:35.774
Killer would have been
very frustrated

00:35.861 --> 00:37.167
'to not be able to take this.'

00:37.254 --> 00:38.690
It looks like a wheel.

00:38.777 --> 00:40.214
Motorcycle wheel.

00:40.301 --> 00:42.129
I don't buy it as a carjacking.

00:42.216 --> 00:44.087
'Maybe the murderer
was covering it up as one'

00:44.174 --> 00:46.350
but if you're after someone's
car and valuables

00:46.437 --> 00:47.743
you grab and bolt.

00:47.830 --> 00:49.397
'You don't waste time
taking off a cufflink.'

00:49.484 --> 00:51.964
Right, carjacking,
a gunshot or a stab wound

00:52.052 --> 00:53.183
is more likely than a beating.

00:53.270 --> 00:54.967
Beating like this
takes time.

00:55.055 --> 00:56.230
The murder was personal.

00:56.317 --> 00:57.448
No surprise there.

00:57.535 --> 00:58.971
The haircut,
the suit, the cologne.

00:59.059 --> 01:00.321
This man had enemies.

01:00.408 --> 01:01.757
His cologne tells you
he had enemies?

01:01.844 --> 01:04.803
Sure.
Okay, confrontational.

01:04.890 --> 01:06.936
Finishing touch
on a wardrobe that says

01:07.023 --> 01:09.591
"Pay attention.
Show respect."

01:09.678 --> 01:11.984
This was an extrovert,
tough guy, a professional.

01:12.072 --> 01:14.683
A backroom politician
or a lawyer, a fixer.

01:14.770 --> 01:16.511
'The type that's good
with people.'

01:16.598 --> 01:19.688
Makin' people do things
they maybe don't wanna do.

01:19.775 --> 01:22.343
Uh, what he is, is useless
until we know whohe is.

01:23.866 --> 01:25.128
Well, I can do that too.

01:27.478 --> 01:29.524
Oh, no, Jane. I, uh, I checked.
The phone's not on him--

01:29.611 --> 01:31.395
The signal light's still on.
Phone's in range.

01:31.482 --> 01:33.354
His assailant probably
threw it in the trees.

01:35.530 --> 01:36.792
What are you doing?

01:36.879 --> 01:38.228
I'm makin' a call.

01:38.315 --> 01:39.795
But you don't have
the phone.

01:39.882 --> 01:41.971
- I have my voice.
- You still need the phone.

01:42.058 --> 01:44.408
Wanna use the voice activation?
You need its names and numbers.

01:44.495 --> 01:46.802
There is one name
programmed into every phone

01:46.889 --> 01:49.500
particularly into one
belonging to a middle-aged man

01:49.587 --> 01:50.980
that was wearing
a wedding band.

01:52.808 --> 01:53.939
Home.

01:56.072 --> 01:57.856
[phone ringing]

02:00.381 --> 02:01.512
[female #1]
'Hello?'

02:01.599 --> 02:03.297
Hello,
this is Patrick Jane

02:03.384 --> 02:04.863
from the California Bureau
of Investigation.

02:04.950 --> 02:07.823
I was wondering if you knew
a man six feet tall, mid 40s

02:07.910 --> 02:11.174
salt and pepper hair,
gray custom-made suit

02:11.261 --> 02:14.003
weighing about 192,
give or take?

02:14.090 --> 02:15.700
[female #1]
'That's my husband
Gordon Hodge.'

02:15.787 --> 02:18.703
- Gordon Hodge?
- 'You said you're from CBI?'

02:18.790 --> 02:20.270
'Is something wrong?'

02:20.357 --> 02:22.054
Uh, just a sec.

02:22.142 --> 02:23.360
It's for you.

02:30.106 --> 02:31.151
Hello?

02:32.195 --> 02:34.589
[theme music]

02:43.337 --> 02:45.730
[instrumental music]

03:00.832 --> 03:03.139
[doorbell ringing]

03:03.226 --> 03:06.229
[Mrs. Hodge]
I knew that something like this
would happen sooner or later.

03:06.316 --> 03:09.928
[Lisbon]
Well, was your husband having
some sort of trouble lately?

03:10.015 --> 03:13.976
Gordon was a criminal attorney
with a very special practice.

03:14.063 --> 03:17.849
He had only one client,
the Sinner Saints.

03:17.936 --> 03:19.677
- Bikers, are they?
- Yeah.

03:19.764 --> 03:22.332
They're one of the top
biker gangs in the state.

03:22.419 --> 03:24.160
They run some legit businesses,
but mostly

03:24.247 --> 03:26.423
they're into drugs
and prostitution

03:26.510 --> 03:29.948
'low-rent protection rackets,
that kind of thing.'

03:30.035 --> 03:31.820
[Mrs. Hodge]
'For years, I begged
him to get out'

03:31.907 --> 03:34.257
'but Gordon said that'

03:34.344 --> 03:36.564
'a lawyer never abandons
his client.'

03:36.651 --> 03:39.044
It's unethical.

03:39.131 --> 03:40.263
It's what he always
called them.

03:40.350 --> 03:43.484
Never the gang,
always the client.

03:43.571 --> 03:45.921
When was the last time
you saw him?

03:46.008 --> 03:48.663
[Mrs. Hodge]
'Yesterday morning,
before work.'

03:48.750 --> 03:50.665
Gordon used to meet
these people at all hours.

03:50.752 --> 03:51.796
That's how they are.

03:51.883 --> 03:53.624
So, we didn't get worried

03:53.711 --> 03:55.887
'when he didn't come home
last night.'

03:55.974 --> 03:57.846
Had he been acting
differently lately?

03:57.933 --> 04:00.762
He'd been more on edge
the last week or so.

04:00.849 --> 04:03.155
I think something happened
at work, but I'm not sure what.

04:04.548 --> 04:05.854
Did you ask him
about it?

04:05.941 --> 04:09.727
No, never.
Work was off limits.

04:12.252 --> 04:13.644
He said it was boring.

04:13.731 --> 04:14.819
What was the real reason?

04:16.821 --> 04:18.997
Do you think he was ashamed,
or he sensed your shame?

04:20.782 --> 04:22.087
He wanted to protect us.

04:25.047 --> 04:26.831
Would his colleagues
at the office

04:26.918 --> 04:28.093
have known
what was going on?

04:28.180 --> 04:29.530
No, he was a one-man shop.

04:29.617 --> 04:31.662
Didn't even have a secretary.

04:31.749 --> 04:35.057
'Gordon didn't trust anyone
with his business.'

04:35.144 --> 04:37.886
[Lisbon]
'Any idea who might
have wanted to kill him?'

04:37.973 --> 04:40.802
Well, you might wanna
ask his client.

04:40.889 --> 04:43.195
He knew all their secrets.

04:43.283 --> 04:45.546
He probably learned something
that he shouldn't have.

04:45.633 --> 04:48.418
Either of you ever meet
any of those scumbags?

04:48.505 --> 04:49.593
No.

04:50.986 --> 04:52.727
You two must be very torn.

04:52.814 --> 04:54.555
Living in such a beautiful home.

04:54.642 --> 04:57.297
'Driving nice cars,
going to good schools.'

04:57.384 --> 04:59.211
All paid for
by dangerous criminals

04:59.299 --> 05:03.607
or, uh, scumbags,
as my colleague says.

05:03.694 --> 05:07.394
Do I wish that Gordon would have
defended civil rights leaders?

05:07.481 --> 05:09.221
Yes, of course!

05:09.309 --> 05:11.746
'But he believed that everyone
had a constitutional right'

05:11.833 --> 05:15.271
to have a good defense.
He had his principles.

05:19.754 --> 05:21.146
Thank you for your time.

05:26.151 --> 05:28.458
Did you go to some interview
school I've never heard of?

05:28.545 --> 05:30.504
Next time, get the facts,
save the editorial.

05:30.591 --> 05:32.419
Yes, ma'am.

05:32.506 --> 05:34.812
I know,Jane did it too.
He's not a CBI agent.

05:34.899 --> 05:36.640
From you, I expect
professional standards.

05:36.727 --> 05:38.076
Yes, boss.

05:38.163 --> 05:39.513
That was the captain
of the local CHIPS.

05:39.600 --> 05:40.992
Hodge's car was just
fished out of a lake

05:41.079 --> 05:42.342
about a mile
from the murder scene.

05:42.429 --> 05:43.517
No good for prints.

05:43.604 --> 05:44.822
'He said that two weeks back'

05:44.909 --> 05:46.563
'they busted Hodge
at a highway rest stop'

05:46.650 --> 05:48.304
walkin' to his car
with two ounces of coke

05:48.391 --> 05:49.958
and two ounces
of meth in his pockets.

05:50.045 --> 05:51.133
Nailed him
with felony possession.

05:51.220 --> 05:52.264
Nice.

05:52.352 --> 05:54.310
Only the DA dropped the charges.

05:54.397 --> 05:56.007
'There was some
unlawful search technicality.'

05:56.094 --> 05:57.618
[Lisbon]
'Either Hodge
is a great lawyer..'

05:57.705 --> 05:59.141
Or the DA turned him
in exchange for dropping

05:59.228 --> 06:01.317
the charges, planned to
use him as an informant.

06:01.404 --> 06:03.232
- Well if the Saints found out--
- Yeah, they'd kill him.

06:03.319 --> 06:04.581
They didknow about the charges.

06:04.668 --> 06:06.322
Their boss, Von McBride,
posted Hodge's bail.

06:06.409 --> 06:07.584
[Lisbon]
'Well, talk to your friends
at the DA.'

06:07.671 --> 06:09.151
Find out what
the story is there.

06:09.238 --> 06:10.892
Jane and I'll go talk
to the Sinner Saints.

06:10.979 --> 06:12.894
- Okay, be careful.
- Want me to come for backup?

06:12.981 --> 06:15.984
Uh, no. Talk to forensics
about the car.

06:16.071 --> 06:18.029
Jane, let's go.

06:18.116 --> 06:19.596
Now, please?

06:19.683 --> 06:20.815
Come on.

06:25.297 --> 06:27.778
[instrumental music]

06:40.225 --> 06:42.619
[music continues]

06:47.798 --> 06:50.235
- Beautiful, huh?
- No, not really.

06:50.322 --> 06:51.759
I fail to see the charm.

06:51.846 --> 06:53.500
It's the glamour
of mobility.

06:53.587 --> 06:55.589
That's why the girls
went for Cain, and not Abel.

06:55.676 --> 06:57.808
- Is that right?
- Yeah, nomads.

06:57.895 --> 06:59.375
Sexier than farmers.

06:59.462 --> 07:01.116
They have romance.

07:01.203 --> 07:03.597
[cell phone ringing]

07:04.336 --> 07:05.729
Lisbon.

07:05.816 --> 07:07.035
I spoke to my friend
in the DA's office.

07:07.122 --> 07:08.689
They didn't make
a deal with Hodge.

07:08.776 --> 07:10.517
'They let him go because
the case was less than ironclad'

07:10.604 --> 07:12.606
and they've already lost too
many to Hodge and the Saints.

07:12.693 --> 07:14.869
Last ten years, they've beaten
the rap in over 50 cases.

07:14.956 --> 07:17.306
Murder, rape, drug trafficking.
They're bulletproof.

07:17.393 --> 07:19.221
Nobody's bulletproof.

07:19.308 --> 07:22.137
Well, the DA says
to stay away from them.

07:22.224 --> 07:23.443
'They're bad news.'

07:23.530 --> 07:25.357
Good, sound lawyerly advice.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.316
I'll take that
under advisement.

07:29.405 --> 07:30.798
- You ready?
- Whoo.

07:34.236 --> 07:37.021
[heavy metal music]

07:42.462 --> 07:44.202
There's romance for you.

07:47.684 --> 07:49.077
We're with the CBI.

07:49.164 --> 07:51.688
We're looking
for Von McBride.

07:51.775 --> 07:54.648
Not here, which is where
you need to be.

07:54.735 --> 07:56.606
Well, can you tell us
where he is?

07:58.390 --> 07:59.696
No, I cannot.

08:02.525 --> 08:04.571
[Lisbon]
Listen, we're here
for information.

08:04.658 --> 08:06.224
'Not trouble, guys.'

08:06.311 --> 08:09.576
[male #1]
'Well, we've got nothing
to say.'

08:09.663 --> 08:11.273
[Lisbon]
'I can take you in
if you want me to.'

08:11.360 --> 08:12.709
'I prefer to talk here.'

08:12.796 --> 08:14.015
[male #1]
'Like I said'

08:14.102 --> 08:15.843
'we've got nothin'
to talk about.'

08:15.930 --> 08:17.584
'We're not doing
anythin' illegal.'

08:17.671 --> 08:19.455
Mr. McBride?

08:19.542 --> 08:21.631
Your focus
on this pressing matter

08:21.718 --> 08:23.415
suggests you're the man
in charge here.

08:23.503 --> 08:25.983
Yeah, well,
keep on walking, blondie.

08:26.070 --> 08:28.464
We just have a few questions
for you. It won't take long.

08:28.551 --> 08:31.989
Yeah, well, I'm sorry, I don't,
uh, talk to police officers

08:32.076 --> 08:33.513
on the advice of my lawyer.

08:34.818 --> 08:36.298
Your lawyer's dead.

08:36.385 --> 08:37.952
Yeah, I heard that.

08:38.039 --> 08:40.171
But his advice is still good.

08:40.258 --> 08:42.739
Means your business here
is done.

08:42.826 --> 08:45.525
Oh, you don't wanna know
who the informant is then?

08:47.135 --> 08:48.353
What informant?

08:48.440 --> 08:49.616
Oh, I'm sorry.
Forget I spoke.

08:49.703 --> 08:51.661
I'm so sorry.

08:51.748 --> 08:52.923
You messin' with me?

08:53.010 --> 08:53.968
Yeah, I'm messing with you.

08:54.055 --> 08:55.230
There's no informant.

08:56.797 --> 08:58.886
Come here.

08:58.973 --> 09:00.365
You touch him,
and I'll arrest you.

09:02.193 --> 09:04.369
I would loveto see you
try and do that.

09:04.456 --> 09:06.502
What's your name?

09:06.589 --> 09:08.809
- Xander.
- Xander.

09:08.896 --> 09:11.551
Your threats are empty.
She's a state agent.

09:11.638 --> 09:12.943
You're not gonna lay
a finger on her

09:13.030 --> 09:15.206
'and you know that,
so why play tough?'

09:15.293 --> 09:18.296
W-where's that come from?
This need to intimidate?

09:18.383 --> 09:20.690
I'm a sadist,
and I bore easily.

09:20.777 --> 09:23.954
Oh, me, I see
a difficult childhood.

09:24.041 --> 09:26.261
Bad parenting,
a lot of torment.

09:26.348 --> 09:29.873
But I also see how
that suffering gave you

09:29.960 --> 09:31.788
great powers of empathy
and a strong creative side.

09:31.875 --> 09:33.181
And those are the qualities

09:33.268 --> 09:35.052
you should try
and nurture in yourself.

09:35.139 --> 09:37.489
Not this brutish character
you try to hide behind.

09:39.579 --> 09:40.928
Oh, that's Xander, alright.

09:42.930 --> 09:44.061
Full of empathy.

09:48.065 --> 09:49.153
You guys want a drink?

09:50.677 --> 09:52.504
Sure.

09:52.592 --> 09:55.682
So what's this crap
about an informant?

09:55.769 --> 09:58.336
How long have you known about
Hodge's taste for coke and meth?

09:59.816 --> 10:01.383
Couple of years.

10:01.470 --> 10:04.865
Guy liked to party,
but he could still do his job.

10:04.952 --> 10:07.998
[Jane]
Couldn't have been too thrilled
when he got busted.

10:08.085 --> 10:09.434
Case got dropped.

10:09.521 --> 10:11.872
Must have wondered why.

10:11.959 --> 10:13.308
Illegal search.

10:13.395 --> 10:14.875
Yeah.

10:14.962 --> 10:18.269
Either that or Hodge,
uh, flipped on you.

10:18.356 --> 10:20.315
- That son of a--
- Hold on a second, Diamond.

10:20.402 --> 10:21.533
He didn't flip.

10:22.796 --> 10:23.971
There is no informant.

10:25.581 --> 10:26.626
Where were you last night?

10:26.713 --> 10:28.584
Right here.

10:28.671 --> 10:29.977
And I got 30 other brothers

10:30.064 --> 10:31.413
who will vouch for me
and each other.

10:31.500 --> 10:35.591
Look, man,
none of my guys did this.

10:35.678 --> 10:38.594
We loved Gordon, man. He was
like a member of the club.

10:38.681 --> 10:40.248
Yeah, he couldn't ride
worth a damn.

10:40.335 --> 10:41.597
No, he couldn't, huh?

10:41.684 --> 10:43.817
He tried though.

10:43.904 --> 10:45.166
Then, who killed him?

10:45.253 --> 10:46.776
[McBride]
'My guess?'

10:46.863 --> 10:48.517
Probably some other
motorcycle club

10:48.604 --> 10:50.867
looking to put us
out of business.

10:50.954 --> 10:52.042
Chaos Brigade.

10:54.349 --> 10:55.655
Bolos Plata.

10:55.742 --> 10:57.657
[female #2]
'Get your hands
off of me.'

10:57.744 --> 10:59.659
'Get off me.'

10:59.746 --> 11:02.923
Help! Get your hands
off of me.

11:03.010 --> 11:04.968
Get off of me.

11:05.055 --> 11:06.143
Get off of me.

11:06.230 --> 11:07.928
Let her go,
and back away!

11:08.015 --> 11:10.017
- Back away now!
- Get your hands off me.

11:12.497 --> 11:14.151
You're murderers.

11:14.238 --> 11:15.805
All of you.

11:15.892 --> 11:18.199
Ma'am, take it easy.
I'm CBI.

11:18.286 --> 11:19.243
Ma'am!

11:19.330 --> 11:20.984
Police. Stop!

11:21.071 --> 11:22.420
Out of the way.
Ma'am!

11:23.378 --> 11:25.772
[dramatic music]

11:30.907 --> 11:33.344
Who was that?
Is she a friend of yours?

11:33.431 --> 11:35.477
Never seen her before.

11:35.564 --> 11:38.654
Mentally deranged,
seems like. Poor thing.

11:38.741 --> 11:41.265
You know,
you're a very good liar.

11:41.352 --> 11:43.572
Most people subconsciously
signal dishonesty

11:43.659 --> 11:46.053
but you, there's nothing.
No inner conflict.

11:46.140 --> 11:47.358
Usually, that's the mark

11:47.445 --> 11:50.797
of what shrinks
like to call a sociopath.

11:50.884 --> 11:53.582
Well, if by sociopath,
you mean that if you cross me

11:53.669 --> 11:56.498
I would enjoy watching you
suffer pain before I kill you..

11:58.500 --> 12:00.197
...then, yeah,
I'm a sociopath.

12:01.721 --> 12:02.852
See ya.

12:05.507 --> 12:06.682
Bye.

12:15.909 --> 12:17.562
[Rigsby]
So, we talked
to the gang unit.

12:17.649 --> 12:19.739
There's no other biker gang
that would cross the Saints

12:19.826 --> 12:21.784
and run the risk of starting
a war that they couldn't win.

12:21.871 --> 12:23.525
[Jane]
This is incredible.
You should see this.

12:23.612 --> 12:25.440
Hold on. Anything on
the woman in the parking lot?

12:25.527 --> 12:27.181
Sinner Saints
have their own website.

12:27.268 --> 12:29.226
- Really?
- Yeah.

12:29.313 --> 12:31.272
We cross-checked registrations
of the truck model and color

12:31.359 --> 12:33.100
with driver's license photos
fitting her description.

12:33.187 --> 12:35.319
No hits, truck must be
registered to her husband

12:35.406 --> 12:36.538
or other family member.

12:36.625 --> 12:37.887
McBride's clamming up about her

12:37.974 --> 12:38.932
means he's hiding something.

12:39.019 --> 12:40.194
He's merged two other gangs

12:40.281 --> 12:41.761
into the Saints
in the last five years.

12:41.848 --> 12:43.937
It's the fastest growing gang
in the nation.

12:44.024 --> 12:45.634
Go to Hodge's office,
see if you can find

12:45.721 --> 12:47.723
anything on the gang's
operation that pops.

12:47.810 --> 12:49.725
And have the Deerfield PD
issue a BOLO

12:49.812 --> 12:51.205
on the woman's pickup truck.

12:51.292 --> 12:53.250
- Right.
- You can buy logo merchandise.

12:53.337 --> 12:57.341
Sinner Saints coffee mugs,
decals, beach towels. Whoa!

12:57.428 --> 13:00.170
And some various other
interesting little knick-knacks.

13:00.257 --> 13:01.998
- Nice.
- Yeah.

13:02.085 --> 13:03.478
Well, if they do it,
we should do it.

13:03.565 --> 13:06.002
A range of casual wear, maybe?

13:06.089 --> 13:07.308
Sensible shoes?

13:09.266 --> 13:10.746
I'll get right on that.

13:12.356 --> 13:14.097
Lisbon loafers.

13:14.184 --> 13:15.316
Found something, boss.

13:16.883 --> 13:18.623
These are Gordon Hodge's
cell phone calls

13:18.710 --> 13:20.103
from the night
of the murder.

13:20.190 --> 13:21.844
All were routine business calls

13:21.931 --> 13:24.499
Von McBride, other lawyers,
court officials.

13:24.586 --> 13:27.676
'But it's the last call
that bumps.'

13:27.763 --> 13:30.592
"7:23, incoming
from a Constance Hoyt.

13:30.679 --> 13:31.898
Current address unknown."

13:31.985 --> 13:33.464
Must not want people
finding her.

13:33.551 --> 13:34.814
Well, I went back
three months.

13:34.901 --> 13:36.859
A lot of calls
between her and Hodge.

13:36.946 --> 13:38.469
- Did you try the number?
- Twice.

13:38.556 --> 13:40.558
Got one of those
computer voicemail messages.

13:40.645 --> 13:42.212
Plus, I ran her name
through the DMV

13:42.299 --> 13:43.823
for registration
of a black pickup truck.

13:43.910 --> 13:45.215
She's not
your parking lot woman.

13:45.302 --> 13:47.130
Check Von McBride's
cell phone records.

13:47.217 --> 13:49.829
See if he had any contact
with this Constance Hoyt.

13:53.876 --> 13:56.400
Bingo.
Couple of chatty Cathys.

13:56.487 --> 13:58.620
Talking three
or four times a day.

13:58.707 --> 13:59.708
Either she's his mom, or..

13:59.795 --> 14:01.057
His girlfriend.

14:04.104 --> 14:06.497
[heavy metal music]

14:18.988 --> 14:21.425
Constance?

14:21.512 --> 14:23.558
We just have a couple
questions for you.

14:23.645 --> 14:24.994
[motorcycle whirring]

14:25.081 --> 14:27.344
Constance.

14:27.431 --> 14:28.824
- I'll drive.
- No time!

14:28.911 --> 14:30.478
[dramatic music]

14:31.958 --> 14:33.263
- Boss, seat belt.
- Go!

14:36.092 --> 14:38.486
[music continues]

14:44.753 --> 14:45.841
[tires screeching]

14:49.671 --> 14:51.934
[music continues]

14:59.072 --> 15:00.725
Bike's got too much muscle.
You're gonna have to..

15:03.728 --> 15:06.122
[music continues]

15:30.016 --> 15:31.321
[grunting]

15:32.975 --> 15:34.585
[Van Pelt]
'Don't move.'

15:34.672 --> 15:35.978
[Lisbon]
'Keep your hands
where I can see 'em.'

15:36.065 --> 15:39.068
Do not even think
of moving.

15:39.155 --> 15:40.504
I gotta get you
out of the office more.

15:44.334 --> 15:45.379
You're under arrest.

15:50.688 --> 15:51.820
You got Hodge's office key?

15:53.300 --> 15:55.171
So what's your problem
with bikers?

15:55.258 --> 15:57.957
- I hate bikers.
- Why's that?

15:58.044 --> 16:00.394
- My dad was a biker.
- Really?

16:00.481 --> 16:02.613
I didn't know that.

16:02.700 --> 16:05.442
No? Well, I thought
you read my file.

16:05.529 --> 16:06.748
Well, it says
he was a big-time criminal.

16:06.835 --> 16:08.184
Didn't specify
any affiliations.

16:11.492 --> 16:13.581
Jimmy marks on the doorknob.

16:13.668 --> 16:15.496
I doubt that was part
of the original decor.

16:15.583 --> 16:17.977
[dramatic music]

16:27.334 --> 16:28.726
- Door's clear.
- Clear.

16:30.250 --> 16:31.294
The desk's clear.

16:35.385 --> 16:36.647
[sighs]

16:38.475 --> 16:40.260
Cracks are on the outside
of the window.

16:40.347 --> 16:42.001
It means a previous
break-in attempt.

16:42.088 --> 16:43.263
'I think they were looking
for something'

16:43.350 --> 16:44.742
or just trying
to send a message?

16:47.049 --> 16:48.398
Message was definitely
a part of it.

16:56.580 --> 16:58.713
Do you prefer Constance,
or Diamond?

17:00.280 --> 17:02.586
I prefer to get
the hell out of here.

17:02.673 --> 17:03.892
You ran from the police.

17:03.979 --> 17:06.025
Endangered the lives
of two agents.

17:06.112 --> 17:07.809
You could be here
a couple of days.

17:07.896 --> 17:10.072
- I don't think that's right.
- Why did you run?

17:10.159 --> 17:13.293
I ran because I'm deadif
anyone sees me talking to cops.

17:13.380 --> 17:15.425
The Saints are all paranoid
about informants now

17:15.512 --> 17:16.992
which is why
I'm not saying a word.

17:17.079 --> 17:19.081
Tell us about your affair
with Gordon Hodge.

17:22.128 --> 17:23.607
[scoffs]

17:23.694 --> 17:25.131
I wasn't sleeping with Gordon.

17:27.394 --> 17:28.569
Oh!

17:32.747 --> 17:35.010
Uh, yes, you were.

17:42.887 --> 17:45.238
It was only a few months.
We were just having fun.

17:45.325 --> 17:47.588
It's not like Von doesn't
sleep around on me and..

17:49.198 --> 17:50.504
Gordon treated me nice.

17:50.591 --> 17:52.201
You had genuine feelings
for him.

17:52.288 --> 17:54.203
He was decent.

17:54.290 --> 17:55.552
He never looked down
on you.

17:57.641 --> 18:00.122
He just got sucked in
too deep with the Saints.

18:00.209 --> 18:02.864
Did you know
he was arrested for possession?

18:02.951 --> 18:05.345
Told him a hundred times
to be careful..

18:05.432 --> 18:07.129
...but he got dumb
about it.

18:07.216 --> 18:09.653
Ah, well, drugs simply
make people careless.

18:09.740 --> 18:12.439
You had to be a little concerned
about McBride finding out.

18:12.526 --> 18:14.528
It would have made things
complicated.

18:14.615 --> 18:16.704
Complicated is one way
to put it.

18:16.791 --> 18:19.315
So you called him that night.
Then what happened?

18:19.402 --> 18:22.144
- Did you go and see him?
- No!

18:22.231 --> 18:24.190
No.

18:24.277 --> 18:26.714
I called to break it off.
I heard him answer the phone.

18:26.801 --> 18:30.848
And I'd tried to talk to him,
but the line went dead.

18:30.935 --> 18:32.372
What about the woman
in the parking lot?

18:32.459 --> 18:33.764
I don't know.

18:33.851 --> 18:35.418
Von doesn't talk
gang business with me.

18:35.505 --> 18:36.941
Had you seen her before?

18:37.028 --> 18:38.813
She's come around
a few times

18:38.900 --> 18:40.380
the last couple of weeks,
same thing.

18:40.467 --> 18:42.947
Lots of crazy yelling,
then taking off.

18:43.034 --> 18:44.166
Look..

18:45.124 --> 18:46.734
You, um..

18:46.821 --> 18:48.301
You gotta promise

18:48.388 --> 18:51.086
that Von doesn't find out
about me and Gordon.

18:51.173 --> 18:53.480
He keeps his cards close.

18:53.567 --> 18:55.177
He could already know.

18:55.264 --> 18:57.527
'Killed Hodge
out of jealousy.'

18:57.614 --> 18:59.703
Trust me.

18:59.790 --> 19:01.444
If Von knew..

19:01.531 --> 19:03.446
...Gordon's wouldn't be
the only dead body.

19:05.405 --> 19:06.841
Only one other person knew.

19:09.017 --> 19:10.627
And that was bad enough.

19:10.714 --> 19:12.020
Who was that other person?

19:15.545 --> 19:17.330
We have information
that suggests

19:17.417 --> 19:19.723
you knew about Gordon
and another woman.

19:22.857 --> 19:24.946
Yes, I did.

19:25.033 --> 19:27.427
How?

19:27.514 --> 19:30.560
About four months ago,
I found a valet stub

19:30.647 --> 19:33.868
on the driveway
from the Deerfield Inn.

19:33.955 --> 19:35.609
So one night,
I followed him

19:35.696 --> 19:39.090
and saw him go in
with that biker girl.

19:39.178 --> 19:41.354
Did you confront him?

19:41.441 --> 19:43.138
More like yell and hit him.

19:44.661 --> 19:46.794
He promised
he'd stop seeing her.

19:46.881 --> 19:48.187
I took him at his word

19:48.274 --> 19:50.319
and I never asked him
about it again.

19:50.406 --> 19:52.539
Why not?

19:52.626 --> 19:54.062
Because I didn't wanna
hear him lie to me.

19:55.672 --> 19:57.457
Mrs. Hodge..

19:57.544 --> 19:59.763
...if you picked up
on your husband's affair

19:59.850 --> 20:03.071
you must have suspected about
his other illicit activities.

20:03.158 --> 20:06.379
I knew about the drugs
and the partying.

20:06.466 --> 20:08.598
He was surrounded by it.

20:08.685 --> 20:10.948
Why didn't you tell us
about this earlier?

20:11.035 --> 20:12.820
Because Gordon is dead.

20:12.907 --> 20:15.736
Anything that I said or did
would not bring him back.

20:15.823 --> 20:19.043
My son draws stares
and whispers

20:19.130 --> 20:21.437
'because of his father,
Agent Lisbon.'

20:21.524 --> 20:24.527
Both of us,
we deserve to grieve

20:24.614 --> 20:26.790
without shame and scandal,
don't we?

20:28.052 --> 20:29.967
Yes, you do.

20:30.054 --> 20:31.839
And if she'd followed
her husband once before

20:31.926 --> 20:33.536
she could have tailed him again
and killed him.

20:33.623 --> 20:35.538
No, she didn't do it.
She loved him.

20:35.625 --> 20:37.671
She was a prisoner
of her husband's life.

20:37.758 --> 20:39.673
She gets rid of him,
gets a fresh start.

20:39.760 --> 20:41.718
People trapped
in miserable lives

20:41.805 --> 20:42.850
always talk about escaping.

20:42.937 --> 20:44.330
Few actually do it.

20:44.417 --> 20:45.853
It's easier just
to close your eyes

20:45.940 --> 20:47.637
and pretend the misery
doesn't exist.

20:47.724 --> 20:48.769
[knocking]

20:48.856 --> 20:50.553
Boss, you might wanna see this.

20:54.078 --> 20:55.776
[Cho]
This is from a security camera
across the street.

20:55.863 --> 20:57.995
It was the third incident
in two weeks.

20:58.082 --> 21:00.171
Building owner said Hodge didn't
wanna report the earlier ones

21:00.259 --> 21:02.086
'because he didn't want
Deerfield PD combing through'

21:02.173 --> 21:03.784
his office and accidentally
finding something

21:03.871 --> 21:05.220
in his Sinner Saints file.

21:05.307 --> 21:06.961
There.

21:07.048 --> 21:08.223
Magnify.

21:10.660 --> 21:11.879
'The woman
from the parking lot?'

21:13.968 --> 21:15.970
She certainly gets around.

21:16.057 --> 21:18.277
[instrumental music]

21:22.193 --> 21:23.891
[indistinct chatter]

21:23.978 --> 21:25.893
[McBride]
'Chaos Brigade
controls distribution'

21:25.980 --> 21:28.461
over in Rancho Rosa,
but I figure if we move

21:28.548 --> 21:30.158
'right now, we can
move into Stratton--'

21:30.245 --> 21:31.681
What's up, my brothers?

21:31.768 --> 21:32.943
[clears throat]

21:35.206 --> 21:37.383
We just have one quick
follow-up question for you.

21:39.646 --> 21:43.389
I've exceeded my quota
of answering cops' questions.

21:43.476 --> 21:44.694
And my quota of crazy.

21:46.522 --> 21:48.176
The woman,
in the parking lot.

21:50.918 --> 21:52.441
Uh, like I said,
she must have mistaken me--

21:52.528 --> 21:54.835
She was seen vandalizing
Hodge's office.

21:58.839 --> 22:00.710
She find anything
she shouldn't have?

22:00.797 --> 22:04.061
His files were intact.
She got nothing.

22:04.148 --> 22:05.933
We have nothing further
to talk about, then.

22:06.020 --> 22:08.762
The sooner this case is closed,
the sooner we're gone

22:08.849 --> 22:10.677
and you're back
to business as usual.

22:10.764 --> 22:13.157
[instrumental music]

22:18.206 --> 22:20.556
Last name is Guthrie.

22:20.643 --> 22:24.647
She's the sister of a gentleman
I was accused of killing.

22:24.734 --> 22:26.519
Falsely, of course.

22:26.606 --> 22:28.216
'Trial was a couple
of weeks ago.'

22:29.783 --> 22:32.438
Gordon hit a home run.
Got me off.

22:32.525 --> 22:33.961
And you weren't eager
to ID her

22:34.048 --> 22:36.137
because you didn't want us
poking around your case?

22:36.224 --> 22:38.531
Hey, all I know is
that she's been coming around

22:38.618 --> 22:42.273
from time to time, saying
some very offensive things.

22:43.884 --> 22:45.102
Thanks for your cooperation.

22:46.756 --> 22:48.192
You think she killed Gordon?

22:49.585 --> 22:52.414
Like I said,
thanks for your cooperation.

22:54.329 --> 22:56.679
I've got one last question.

22:56.766 --> 22:59.813
If Hodge wasn't the informant
in your gang..

22:59.900 --> 23:01.075
...who do you think it is?

23:01.162 --> 23:02.555
I mean,
I tried asking the DA

23:02.642 --> 23:04.383
but he's kind of
a secretive bastard, huh?

23:05.993 --> 23:07.124
What do you think?

23:09.300 --> 23:11.738
Mr. Jane,
we're a motorcycle club.

23:11.825 --> 23:13.740
Not a gang.

23:13.827 --> 23:16.699
And I can assure you
there is no informant.

23:16.786 --> 23:18.962
Well, you'd know best.

23:26.013 --> 23:27.754
Why does he keep going on
about this informant?

23:29.538 --> 23:31.627
He's just talking.

23:31.714 --> 23:33.499
Let's get down to business.

23:36.893 --> 23:38.329
So, Miss Guthrie?

23:38.417 --> 23:41.724
Von McBride should be
sitting here, not me.

23:41.811 --> 23:43.944
Court docs say your brother,
Rick was an auto mechanic.

23:44.031 --> 23:45.989
McBride blamed him
for screwing up a repair

23:46.076 --> 23:47.861
and your brother
refused to redo it.

23:47.948 --> 23:49.689
McBride allegedly got angry
and killed him.

23:49.776 --> 23:52.213
Not allegedly.
He killed him.

23:53.997 --> 23:56.347
He beat him to death
with a crowbar.

23:56.435 --> 23:58.437
- He murdered him.
- And the jury disagreed.

24:00.003 --> 24:02.049
McBride acted
in self-defense, right?

24:02.136 --> 24:03.659
That's because
that lawyer, Hodge

24:03.746 --> 24:06.488
made it look like
it was my brother's fault.

24:06.575 --> 24:08.969
He started throwing around
all these lies about my brother.

24:09.056 --> 24:11.058
Saying that my brother
was a druggie.

24:11.145 --> 24:14.235
That he was aggressive.
That he was mentally unstable.

24:14.322 --> 24:16.498
So you get all worked up,
harass the gang

24:16.585 --> 24:17.804
trash Hodge's office,
right?

24:19.196 --> 24:21.808
You wanna arrest me
for that. Go ahead.

24:21.895 --> 24:23.810
I'm not gonna fight you.
I'm too tired.

24:23.897 --> 24:25.115
You ever try Hodge's home?

24:26.247 --> 24:27.683
Once.

24:27.770 --> 24:28.945
But his kid came outside.

24:30.077 --> 24:32.079
I don't have a beef with him.

24:32.166 --> 24:34.211
So I took off
before I could do anything.

24:34.298 --> 24:35.778
And what were you gonna do?

24:35.865 --> 24:36.953
I don't know.

24:37.040 --> 24:38.215
I was..

24:41.392 --> 24:42.524
I don't know.

24:44.613 --> 24:46.354
I wanted Hodge
to understand

24:46.441 --> 24:48.530
what he had done to me
and to my family.

24:48.617 --> 24:50.010
And when was this?

24:52.447 --> 24:54.754
- Two days ago.
- The day of the murder.

24:54.841 --> 24:56.582
- Where were you that night?
- Home.

24:56.669 --> 24:58.061
Can anyone verify it?

24:58.148 --> 25:00.107
I live alone,
but I didn't--

25:00.194 --> 25:01.412
Now, six months ago

25:01.500 --> 25:03.937
you were arrested
in a road rage incident.

25:04.024 --> 25:05.634
Got out of your car
at a red light.

25:05.721 --> 25:07.201
Attacked a man
in an SUV.

25:07.288 --> 25:08.942
What does this have
to do with anything?

25:09.029 --> 25:11.292
You're an angry person
and you express it physically.

25:13.250 --> 25:16.036
I'm not angry.
I am sad.

25:16.123 --> 25:18.038
My brother was a good man.

25:21.781 --> 25:23.043
The only crime he committed

25:23.130 --> 25:25.349
was standing up
to that bastard, McBride.

25:25.436 --> 25:27.264
Hodge blackens the name
of your dead brother

25:27.351 --> 25:29.049
and gets Von McBride off.

25:29.136 --> 25:30.441
'Now maybe trashing his office'

25:30.529 --> 25:32.008
'didn't give you
enough satisfaction.'

25:32.095 --> 25:34.576
Perfectly understandable
if your frustration boils over.

25:34.663 --> 25:35.751
And you can't touch Von McBride.

25:35.838 --> 25:36.796
He's got 20 bikers around him

25:36.883 --> 25:38.362
all the time.

25:38.449 --> 25:39.712
So maybe you go
for the easier target.

25:41.975 --> 25:44.107
I didn't kill Gordon Hodge.

25:44.194 --> 25:46.588
But I'm sure as hell
glad that he's dead.

25:49.852 --> 25:51.332
[Cho]
She'd been to his house
that day.

25:51.419 --> 25:53.639
Could have laid in wait
and followed him later.

25:53.726 --> 25:55.641
Plus, she was out for revenge,
no more powerful motive.

25:55.728 --> 25:57.773
We don't have nearly enough
to charge her.

25:57.860 --> 25:59.601
I say we hold her
on the vandalism.

25:59.688 --> 26:01.734
Try to dig up something that
puts her at the murder scene.

26:01.821 --> 26:04.258
Or you could release her.

26:04.345 --> 26:06.303
She's obviously impulsive
and sloppy enough

26:06.390 --> 26:08.349
'to get caught on camera.'

26:08.436 --> 26:10.612
She'll think
she's bought herself some time.

26:10.699 --> 26:12.353
And she'd try something
to cover her tracks

26:12.440 --> 26:13.615
and implicate herself.

26:16.444 --> 26:18.272
Cut her loose,
then let's shadow her.

26:18.359 --> 26:19.534
Yes, boss.

26:20.970 --> 26:22.145
[sighs]

26:22.232 --> 26:24.234
Where are you going?

26:24.321 --> 26:26.323
Fresh air.

26:26.410 --> 26:27.586
All this murder talk..

26:27.673 --> 26:30.893
"...is rank.
It stinks to heaven.

26:30.980 --> 26:33.722
It hath the primal
eldest curse upon 't."

26:35.332 --> 26:36.507
Shakespeare.

26:38.814 --> 26:41.469
[instrumental music]

26:55.526 --> 26:57.920
[tires screeching]

27:00.662 --> 27:02.185
Little less pressure
on the brake pedal.

27:03.839 --> 27:05.449
Is your mom here?

27:05.536 --> 27:07.887
Market. That's why
I'm confined to the driveway.

27:07.974 --> 27:09.192
Ah!

27:09.279 --> 27:11.194
You want me
to have her call you?

27:11.281 --> 27:13.719
We know Felicia Guthrie
trespassed on the property

27:13.806 --> 27:15.068
the day your dad was killed.

27:15.155 --> 27:17.897
I-I just need to hear
what happened.

27:17.984 --> 27:20.813
Uh, I was leaving for school.

27:20.900 --> 27:22.771
I saw her hop the gate and come
running up the driveway.

27:22.858 --> 27:24.991
So I ran out
to try to stop her.

27:25.078 --> 27:27.167
And she was yelling
all this stuff about my dad

27:27.254 --> 27:30.605
lying about her brother
and getting Von McBride off.

27:30.692 --> 27:33.608
- Then she just ran away.
- Did your parents see her?

27:33.695 --> 27:36.698
No. Dad was already at work,
and mom was in the shower.

27:36.785 --> 27:39.353
Huh. Any reason you didn't
bring this up earlier?

27:41.094 --> 27:43.792
I don't know. I felt
bad for her, I guess.

27:43.879 --> 27:45.489
Didn't want her
to get in trouble.

27:45.576 --> 27:48.710
Well, just needed
to confirm. Thanks.

27:48.797 --> 27:50.625
[engine grinds]

27:50.712 --> 27:51.844
Whoa!

27:51.931 --> 27:53.236
God!

27:53.323 --> 27:55.238
You need to relax.

27:55.325 --> 27:57.588
It's not gonna help. I'm never
gonna get the hang of this.

27:57.676 --> 28:00.200
That's an easy fix.
You need the right instructor.

28:00.287 --> 28:02.245
Alright, so now you can
speed up a little.

28:04.552 --> 28:07.294
'Excellent. I like how
you're keeping your distance.'

28:07.381 --> 28:09.252
Just trust your instincts.
They're always right.

28:11.124 --> 28:12.647
You're a good instructor.

28:12.734 --> 28:14.997
Yeah, I am,
probably because I have

28:15.084 --> 28:18.174
zero emotional investment
in how you do.

28:18.261 --> 28:20.046
Unlike your father
who I'm guessing

28:20.133 --> 28:22.265
got annoyed
with every mistake you made.

28:22.352 --> 28:24.180
He wasn't the most patient guy.

28:24.267 --> 28:26.313
Probably didn't help that
he was always on his cell phone.

28:28.097 --> 28:29.969
I've been living with his job
my whole life.

28:30.056 --> 28:31.187
You get used to it.

28:33.450 --> 28:34.843
You also get used to the drugs

28:34.930 --> 28:36.279
and the cheating
on your mother?

28:38.107 --> 28:39.543
He promised he'd stop.

28:39.630 --> 28:41.458
Yeah.

28:41.545 --> 28:43.156
Can't be easy
going through life

28:43.243 --> 28:45.680
being labeled
the gang lawyer's son.

28:45.767 --> 28:47.247
It wasn't really that bad.

28:47.334 --> 28:49.249
I mean, girls would come
up to me all the time.

28:49.336 --> 28:52.208
Talk to me about dad
and the gang, like I'm cool.

28:52.295 --> 28:55.211
Instead of a geek,
which I basically am.

28:55.298 --> 28:56.430
Everybody is.

28:58.780 --> 28:59.912
I am.

29:02.305 --> 29:05.482
If he was my father,
I tell ya, I-I..

29:05.569 --> 29:06.875
...I'd be mad at him.

29:08.572 --> 29:10.226
Dad didn't mean
to hurt anyone.

29:10.313 --> 29:13.186
- He was just doing his job.
- Right.

29:13.273 --> 29:16.667
Well, I guess I'd still
love him if he was my father.

29:16.755 --> 29:18.365
Can't say I'd cut him
the same kind of slack

29:18.452 --> 29:20.628
if I was married to him.

29:20.715 --> 29:22.978
Are you trying
to blame my mom?

29:23.065 --> 29:26.329
- 'Cause if you are..
- What?

29:26.416 --> 29:27.983
You're wrong, that's all.

29:28.070 --> 29:30.507
She loved him too.

29:30.594 --> 29:32.553
Well, that brings us
back to Felicia Guthrie

29:32.640 --> 29:33.554
who didn't love him at all.

29:33.641 --> 29:34.729
What exactly did she say

29:34.816 --> 29:36.252
to you when you saw her?

29:36.339 --> 29:37.601
It was hard to tell.

29:37.688 --> 29:40.039
She was just, you know,
ranting, basically.

29:41.301 --> 29:42.476
Didn't make much sense.

29:54.967 --> 29:57.143
Very nicely done.

29:57.230 --> 30:00.363
You'll be out cruising
on Saturday nights in no time.

30:00.450 --> 30:03.192
Just remember,
trust your instincts.

30:03.279 --> 30:04.367
They're always right.

30:04.454 --> 30:05.804
Thank you.

30:05.891 --> 30:06.935
And thanks for
the driving lesson.

30:07.022 --> 30:08.154
Yeah.

30:10.721 --> 30:13.115
[dogs barking]

30:14.464 --> 30:16.075
Still no movement.

30:16.162 --> 30:17.990
Looks like Miss Guthrie's
in for the night.

30:21.384 --> 30:22.690
Talk to Van Pelt recently?

30:22.777 --> 30:23.909
Yep.

30:25.867 --> 30:27.086
- Any progress?
- Nope.

30:29.566 --> 30:30.567
[engine rumbling in distance]

30:30.654 --> 30:32.918
You hear that?

30:33.005 --> 30:34.484
Yeah.

30:34.571 --> 30:36.965
[dramatic music]

30:46.888 --> 30:48.107
They're gonna go
after Felicia.

30:49.891 --> 30:51.284
McBride thinks
she killed Hodge.

30:51.371 --> 30:52.676
He wants payback.

30:52.763 --> 30:54.635
Officers on Hampton,
North of Lexington

30:54.722 --> 30:56.115
request
immediate assistance.

30:58.117 --> 31:00.510
[music continues]

31:04.123 --> 31:05.820
What the hell's going on?

31:05.907 --> 31:07.691
Go back in your house
and stay down.

31:10.564 --> 31:12.871
[music continues]

31:28.234 --> 31:32.064
Do the smart thing
and get out of here right now.

31:32.151 --> 31:34.240
We're not doing
anything illegal.

31:34.327 --> 31:36.198
Disorderly conduct

31:36.285 --> 31:39.723
concealed weapons,
blown exhaust pipes

31:39.810 --> 31:43.379
probably a couple of
outstanding warrants in there.

31:43.466 --> 31:46.643
- 'Screw you, pig!'
- 'No, screw you!'

31:46.730 --> 31:48.863
We could bust
half you clowns right now.

31:52.301 --> 31:53.737
So what's it gonna be?

31:54.913 --> 31:57.306
[music continues]

32:04.270 --> 32:05.619
We'll be seeing you around.

32:12.626 --> 32:14.584
[engines revving]

32:14.671 --> 32:16.369
[indistinct yelling]

32:18.501 --> 32:20.416
Scumbag!

32:20.503 --> 32:21.896
[laughing]

32:28.250 --> 32:29.469
You really don't like bikers.

32:38.826 --> 32:41.481
[Felicia]
'If they think they can
intimidate me, they're wrong.'

32:41.568 --> 32:43.874
Felicia, temperatures
are running hot

32:43.962 --> 32:46.529
so I need you to stay away
from the gang's bar from now on.

32:46.616 --> 32:49.576
[Felicia]
'Yeah. I'll stay away
when you arrest Von McBride.'

32:49.663 --> 32:51.273
And what were you people
doing out here, anyway?

32:51.360 --> 32:53.406
Oh, we think you killed,
uh, Gordon Hodge

32:53.493 --> 32:56.887
so Agent Cho and Rigsby
have been watching you.

32:59.281 --> 33:01.370
Oh, come on,
she was never gonna buy

33:01.457 --> 33:03.677
"We just happened to be
in the neighborhood."

33:03.764 --> 33:06.375
I told you I had nothing
to do with that.

33:06.462 --> 33:08.595
And who told you
that you could go in my house?

33:08.682 --> 33:11.467
Oh, this? I just needed
some tea. Cut through the chill.

33:11.554 --> 33:14.209
Chill, my ass.
You were looking for evidence.

33:14.296 --> 33:16.777
- Felicia, take it easy.
- Don't tell me to take it easy.

33:16.864 --> 33:18.953
When this guy's rifling
through my underwear drawer

33:19.040 --> 33:20.650
looking for a weapon.

33:20.737 --> 33:21.956
It was your closet, actually,
I was looking

33:22.043 --> 33:24.002
for blood-splattered shoes.

33:24.089 --> 33:25.916
- Get off my property.
- You're very touchy.

33:26.004 --> 33:27.135
Go.

33:31.879 --> 33:33.011
You really looked
through her closet?

33:33.098 --> 33:34.186
Laundry, too.

33:34.273 --> 33:35.274
She's been angry and emotional

33:35.361 --> 33:37.319
about her brother.

33:37.406 --> 33:38.929
Which means
that she was sloppy

33:39.017 --> 33:40.583
about Hodge's murder.

33:40.670 --> 33:42.237
Dragged evidence
home with her.

33:42.324 --> 33:43.847
It's just not inside.

33:43.934 --> 33:45.501
Well, there's no garage
or toolshed.

33:45.588 --> 33:47.242
Well, I looked everywhere.

33:47.329 --> 33:49.810
Well, everywhere
except the...garbage.

33:49.897 --> 33:51.812
Why not?

33:51.899 --> 33:53.074
Well, it's garbage.

33:54.597 --> 33:56.382
- Are you done with that?
- Almost.

34:02.431 --> 34:04.651
Yes, the case
is still ongoing

34:04.738 --> 34:06.740
and you are
a person of interest.

34:06.827 --> 34:08.394
'I'd advise you
not to leave town.'

34:10.352 --> 34:11.397
Boss?

34:11.484 --> 34:12.615
Excuse me.

34:14.965 --> 34:16.010
Do you see that?

34:18.230 --> 34:19.318
What's goin' on?

34:19.405 --> 34:20.797
Stay there. Don't move.

34:25.150 --> 34:26.934
[Rigsby]
It's the victim's
missing cufflink.

34:32.244 --> 34:33.767
I didn't do anything wrong.

34:33.854 --> 34:35.638
McBride must have set me up.

34:35.725 --> 34:37.205
Rigsby, put her
in interview one.

34:37.292 --> 34:39.251
Boss, Nina and Lucas Hodge
are here to see you.

34:39.338 --> 34:41.122
- Did she say why?
- 'Cause I asked them down here.

34:41.209 --> 34:42.776
Rigsby, could you bring her
through here, please?

34:42.863 --> 34:44.082
It will just take a minute.

34:45.474 --> 34:46.867
Thank you.

34:46.954 --> 34:48.303
Are you gonna tell me
what this is about?

34:48.390 --> 34:49.696
I'm just closing
your case.

34:53.395 --> 34:55.484
Thanks for coming down,
Mrs. Hodge.

34:55.571 --> 34:58.183
This woman's name
is Felicia Guthrie.

34:58.270 --> 35:00.315
She murdered your husband
out of revenge for getting

35:00.402 --> 35:02.839
Von McBride off a charge
for killing her brother.

35:02.926 --> 35:04.754
- Oh, my God!
- No, I did not kill anyone--

35:04.841 --> 35:06.365
Uh, we have evidence.

35:09.194 --> 35:10.543
We just need
your permission for, uh..

35:10.630 --> 35:12.371
...Lucas to make a formal
statement, saying that

35:12.458 --> 35:14.460
he saw her at your house
the day of the murder.

35:14.547 --> 35:16.810
- You saw her?
- He can fill you in later.

35:16.897 --> 35:19.682
His statement will give us
a better chance at a conviction.

35:19.769 --> 35:22.468
- Absolutely. Anything you need.
- Great. Thank you.

35:22.555 --> 35:25.993
Lucas, if you can confirm
that this is who you saw

35:26.080 --> 35:27.255
then you'll be on your way.

35:29.170 --> 35:30.737
What's gonna happen to her?

35:30.824 --> 35:32.608
Well, probably life in prison.

35:32.695 --> 35:35.742
Uh, if she's lucky, she might
get paroled in 25 years.

35:35.829 --> 35:38.614
No! I swear, I didn't..

35:38.701 --> 35:40.312
- I didn't touch him--
- 'Shut up!'

35:40.399 --> 35:42.009
You took everything from us.

35:42.096 --> 35:44.968
Lucas, we need to book her now,
so could you identify her?

35:45.055 --> 35:47.406
No, she wasn't the one.

35:47.493 --> 35:48.581
I mean, yeah,
she came to the house--

35:48.668 --> 35:50.278
Great. Thanks.
That's all we need.

35:50.365 --> 35:51.932
- Take her away, guys.
- 'No, I didn't do anything.'

35:52.019 --> 35:53.412
- Thank you.
- 'I didn't do anything wrong.'

35:53.499 --> 35:55.370
Trust your instincts, Lucas.
They're always right.

35:55.457 --> 35:56.676
[Felicia]
'I'm telling the truth!'

35:57.720 --> 35:59.896
Let's go.

35:59.983 --> 36:02.290
- She couldn't have done it.
- What makes you say that?

36:02.377 --> 36:03.944
- I just know.
- 'Lucas, they have evidence.'

36:04.031 --> 36:05.946
- This bitch killed your--
- Don't call her that.

36:06.033 --> 36:07.861
It wasn't her.

36:07.948 --> 36:09.210
The only way we can know

36:09.297 --> 36:10.994
for certain is if
you tell us who did it.

36:11.081 --> 36:12.866
Okay, stop talking to my son.

36:12.953 --> 36:14.911
You've got your statement.
Lucas, let's go.

36:14.998 --> 36:16.522
- 'Come on. Let's go.'
- No.

36:16.609 --> 36:18.045
- Lucas--
- Stop.

36:26.880 --> 36:28.055
It was me.

36:30.666 --> 36:32.146
We were out
for a driving lesson.

36:33.756 --> 36:36.542
I was driving badly
that night.

36:36.629 --> 36:38.239
My dad was on the phone
the whole time

36:38.326 --> 36:40.937
like he always was.

36:41.024 --> 36:43.505
He'd get mad every time
I'd make a mistake but..

36:43.592 --> 36:45.377
...I just couldn't seem
to concentrate.

36:45.464 --> 36:47.292
Because of your run-in
with Felicia Guthrie that day?

36:49.424 --> 36:51.731
You didn't talk about her
until I asked

36:51.818 --> 36:53.994
'cause you felt sorry for her.

36:54.081 --> 36:56.431
You didn't wanna draw
suspicion to her

36:56.518 --> 36:58.259
because you knew
she didn't do it.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.045
You were trying to do
the right thing.

37:02.132 --> 37:04.570
I just kept seeing her
in the driveway.

37:04.657 --> 37:08.704
Crying, yelling about how
my dad lied about her brother.

37:10.228 --> 37:12.099
His phone just kept ringing.

37:12.186 --> 37:14.928
And he'd get mad at me
and I'd screw up worse.

37:15.015 --> 37:16.625
And I just..

37:16.712 --> 37:18.801
I couldn't take it anymore.

37:18.888 --> 37:20.716
Next time, his phone rang..

37:20.803 --> 37:23.589
...I grabbed it from him.
I heard her voice.

37:23.676 --> 37:27.941
[Constance]
Hey, Gordon, baby,
it's me. Can you talk?

37:28.028 --> 37:30.987
That biker bitch,
Diamond.

37:31.074 --> 37:32.511
'She kept calling him
Gordon, baby.'

37:32.598 --> 37:34.687
'Said she really
wanted to see him.'

37:34.774 --> 37:37.646
Felicia Guthrie was right.
He was a liar.

37:41.781 --> 37:43.609
I threw the phone into the
woods, and he got really mad.

37:45.263 --> 37:48.004
He promised me he'd stop.

37:48.091 --> 37:49.789
Doing drugs
and cheating on my mom.

37:51.443 --> 37:53.140
Like an idiot,
I believed him.

37:53.967 --> 37:55.490
[grunting]

38:04.847 --> 38:06.675
I called my mom.

38:06.762 --> 38:08.721
She told me what to do.

38:08.808 --> 38:10.853
'I took all the stuff
to make it look like a robbery'

38:10.940 --> 38:12.899
but I couldn't get
that damn cufflink out.

38:14.640 --> 38:16.859
'So I ditched his car
in the lake.'

38:16.946 --> 38:18.470
She drove me home.

38:18.557 --> 38:20.167
The lie gets heavy fast,
doesn't it?

38:23.126 --> 38:24.432
I expect after a while

38:24.519 --> 38:25.651
you wanted to go to the police

38:25.738 --> 38:26.869
and tell them the truth.

38:28.131 --> 38:29.742
Sometimes I wanted to.

38:29.829 --> 38:31.047
Mom said no.

38:32.875 --> 38:34.355
She promised
it would be okay.

38:36.096 --> 38:37.880
Well, it might be..

38:37.967 --> 38:39.142
...someday.

38:44.322 --> 38:45.453
Let's go.

38:47.890 --> 38:49.414
Put your hand out.

38:54.984 --> 38:56.682
I'm sorry, mom.

38:56.769 --> 38:58.771
[Van Pelt]
'Mrs. Hodge,
we need to talk now.'

39:02.427 --> 39:03.558
[instrumental music]

39:05.604 --> 39:08.650
You know, I have to wonder
how that cufflink Rigsby found

39:08.737 --> 39:10.652
made its way
to Felicia Guthrie's house.

39:10.739 --> 39:11.827
That is a conundrum.

39:11.914 --> 39:13.438
Because I'll bet
a year's salary

39:13.525 --> 39:15.527
that if I look
in the evidence locker

39:15.614 --> 39:18.573
the cufflink we found on Hodge
will have mysteriously vanished.

39:20.575 --> 39:22.751
Okay.

39:22.838 --> 39:24.884
I needed Lucas to see
Felicia get arrested.

39:24.971 --> 39:27.147
You needed hard evidence
to charge Felicia.

39:27.234 --> 39:28.366
So..

39:30.411 --> 39:31.760
...I made it happen.

39:31.847 --> 39:33.109
By making
an innocent woman think

39:33.196 --> 39:34.850
she was gonna go
to prison?

39:34.937 --> 39:36.852
As if her life wasn't
hard enough already.

39:36.939 --> 39:40.029
Yes, you're right.
She doesdeserve some justice.

39:40.116 --> 39:42.118
It's good to see
you care.

39:42.205 --> 39:44.904
You know, sarcasm
is the lowest form of wit?

39:50.518 --> 39:53.173
[heavy metal music]

39:53.260 --> 39:55.480
...next Tuesday,
we need about..

39:55.567 --> 39:56.829
...about six, ten bikes.

39:56.916 --> 39:58.657
- So be here--
- Yeah.

39:58.744 --> 40:00.485
[phone ringing]
This will be our real gig.
Hold on.

40:05.620 --> 40:06.752
Yeah?

40:10.973 --> 40:12.366
Alright.

40:12.453 --> 40:13.411
I'll be back in a minute.

40:22.985 --> 40:24.987
[Jane]
'Hey, psst.'

40:26.119 --> 40:27.294
'Over here.'

40:39.088 --> 40:40.307
What's up?

40:42.309 --> 40:43.528
Uh, I just thought
you might wanna know

40:43.615 --> 40:45.007
we caught
Gordon Hodge's killer.

40:46.095 --> 40:48.010
It was his son.

40:48.097 --> 40:49.925
Lot of issues between 'em.

40:50.012 --> 40:53.146
And you felt the need to tell
me this from the shadows

40:53.233 --> 40:54.626
dressed in this get-up?

40:54.713 --> 40:56.845
Self-preservation.

40:56.932 --> 40:59.239
I figured I've worn out
my welcome with your friends.

41:00.196 --> 41:01.763
That's it?

41:01.850 --> 41:02.982
This is what
you had to tell me?

41:03.069 --> 41:06.333
Well, no.
There's, uh, another reason.

41:09.728 --> 41:10.990
You open that envelope..

41:12.513 --> 41:14.776
...and the rat in your gang
will be revealed.

41:14.863 --> 41:17.126
Oh, the rat.

41:17.213 --> 41:19.825
[door opening]

41:19.912 --> 41:21.783
Now turn around and try
not to look too guilty.

41:28.311 --> 41:29.748
What was that about?

41:29.835 --> 41:31.532
What, this?
This is, uh..

41:31.619 --> 41:34.100
[chuckles]
It's kind of funny,
actually.

41:34.187 --> 41:35.275
Funny?

41:35.362 --> 41:37.059
[dramatic music]

41:39.105 --> 41:40.410
Selling us out is funny?

41:42.021 --> 41:44.371
- Hey! Hey!
- Come on, get him inside.

41:44.458 --> 41:47.287
[McBride]
'Hey! Let go, man!'

41:47.374 --> 41:49.768
[instrumental music]

41:51.334 --> 41:52.640
I was set up!

41:56.775 --> 41:59.168
[music continues]

42:10.615 --> 42:12.878
[Jane]
Stay tuned for scenes
from our next episode.

42:16.229 --> 42:17.491
