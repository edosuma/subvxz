00:02.800 --> 00:04.461
(knocking)

00:05.470 --> 00:07.290
(knocking)

00:12.810 --> 00:15.005
The door's open.

00:26.220 --> 00:29.189
(rock music playing
in distance)

00:29.230 --> 00:31.687
(door creaks quietly)

00:38.800 --> 00:41.189
How you doing?

00:42.610 --> 00:44.703
It's, uh, it's dark in here.

00:44.740 --> 00:47.129
No.

00:47.180 --> 00:48.704
Now, don't be that way.

00:50.210 --> 00:52.212
He misses you.

00:52.250 --> 00:53.274
(scoffs)

00:53.320 --> 00:56.380
It's not just
the money.

00:56.420 --> 00:58.479
He wants you back.

00:58.520 --> 01:00.852
Where is he?
Home.

01:00.890 --> 01:02.084
He sent me here to...

01:02.130 --> 01:04.155
Don't, Bill.

01:04.190 --> 01:06.658
It's a phone.
I'm just getting you...
You pull it out,

01:06.700 --> 01:08.327
and I'll shoot your hand off.

01:09.370 --> 01:11.759
Get down
on your knees.

01:13.440 --> 01:15.635
And keep your hand
where it is.

01:15.670 --> 01:18.798
(rock music continues
in distance)

01:26.880 --> 01:28.814
Who called my work?

01:28.850 --> 01:31.114
Who? Y-Your
lawyer called us.

01:31.150 --> 01:32.412
(nervous chuckle)

01:32.460 --> 01:34.781
We returned.

01:34.820 --> 01:37.186
Phone,huh?

01:38.830 --> 01:41.298
Who called her at home?
Your lawyer?

01:41.330 --> 01:42.729
Uh, I did. Why?

01:42.770 --> 01:44.169
Ow!

01:45.200 --> 01:46.337
(groans)

01:46.370 --> 01:47.769
What was that for?!

01:47.800 --> 01:50.337
(phone ringing)

01:50.370 --> 01:53.203
He'll get angry
if I don't answer.

01:55.510 --> 01:57.501
(both grunting)

02:01.850 --> 02:04.341
(yelling)

02:04.390 --> 02:07.655
Aah, you bitch!
You stupid bitch!

02:07.690 --> 02:09.226
(Bill yells)

02:09.260 --> 02:10.682
(Bill groans loudly)

02:13.360 --> 02:14.827
You bitch!

02:14.860 --> 02:15.827
Quiet, Bill.

02:15.860 --> 02:17.828
(phone ringing)

02:21.370 --> 02:22.530
Go to hell.

02:22.570 --> 02:23.832
Just go to hell.
Hi, honey.

02:23.870 --> 02:26.771
Bill's here.
You want to talk to him?

02:29.480 --> 02:30.947
(sobbin :
OWN?)

02:30.980 --> 02:32.470
Just so you know,

02:32.520 --> 02:35.478
the money is mine--
community property.

02:35.520 --> 02:40.787
I don't want any trouble, but I
am staying put and it's over.

02:40.820 --> 02:43.880
I've moved on.
You should, too.

02:43.930 --> 02:45.249
(line clicks)

02:45.290 --> 02:46.791
You run again,

02:46.830 --> 02:48.320
he'll find you.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.468
(loud thud)
(yelling)

02:54.000 --> 02:57.834
("Mucka Blucka"
playing on radio)

03:05.280 --> 03:07.419
(siren whoops)

03:07.450 --> 03:09.441
("Mucka Blucka" continues)

03:12.390 --> 03:14.210
What's going on?

03:14.260 --> 03:16.956
Nothing. I don't know.
GRACE:
Is that for us?

03:16.990 --> 03:19.823
What'd we do?
Okay, uh, Zach,
put your signal on.

03:19.860 --> 03:21.919
Grace, turn the radio down.

03:21.960 --> 03:23.860
(music stops)
I shouldn't have fallen asleep.

03:31.040 --> 03:33.702
OFFICER:
Hi there. How's it going?
ZACH: It's good.

03:33.740 --> 03:35.628
Can I see your driver's license,
registration

03:35.680 --> 03:37.545
and proof of insurance?
Sure.

03:37.580 --> 03:39.514
What'd we do wrong?
ALICIA:
Grace.

03:40.650 --> 03:41.810
Where you all headed?

03:41.850 --> 03:43.841
Uh, home. Chicago.
Highland Park.

03:43.890 --> 03:45.642
And where you
coming from?

03:45.690 --> 03:46.884
Washington University.

03:46.920 --> 03:48.615
We were checking
out colleges.

03:48.660 --> 03:51.754
Ah. Sorry, I can't really hear
very well here.

03:51.790 --> 03:55.453
Could you step back with me,
I'll tell you why I stopped you?
Sure.

04:00.940 --> 04:02.908
ALICIA:
How fast were we going?

04:02.940 --> 04:04.669
GRACE:
I don't know.

04:04.710 --> 04:06.871
Not that fast.

04:06.910 --> 04:09.401
Maybe it's
Uncle Owen's car?

04:09.450 --> 04:11.645
Maybe he has tickets
or something.

04:13.380 --> 04:14.938
Wait here.

04:14.980 --> 04:17.949
Tell him we
just bought it.

04:22.020 --> 04:23.749
ALICIA: Everything
all right, Officer?

04:23.790 --> 04:25.724
Yes, ma'am. Why don't
you stay right there,

04:25.760 --> 04:26.988
and I'll be
right with you.

04:28.030 --> 04:30.794
OFFICER:
So there's nothing wrong?

04:30.830 --> 04:33.367
Thank you, son.

04:33.400 --> 04:36.460
As I was just telling
your son, about a
half mile back

04:36.510 --> 04:40.037
I saw him hit the brake
lights when he saw me
and then speed up again.

04:40.080 --> 04:43.049
I thought maybe he was
having some trouble. Was he?
Having some trouble?

04:43.080 --> 04:44.001
No.

04:44.050 --> 04:46.041
He said you were asleep, so...

04:47.650 --> 04:50.915
Just so you know, Officer,
my son just bought this car...

04:50.950 --> 04:52.508
Here's the thing.

04:52.560 --> 04:53.879
Your son seemed a bit worried

04:53.920 --> 04:55.785
when I was talking
to him just now,

04:55.820 --> 04:57.856
and this roadway
is a major conduit

04:57.890 --> 04:59.528
for drugs, money, weapons...

04:59.560 --> 05:01.926
He's 17 years old, being
questioned by a police officer.

05:01.960 --> 05:03.791
That's probably why.
You're probably
right, but, if you

05:03.830 --> 05:05.764
don't mind,
I have my K-9 in my car here.

05:05.800 --> 05:06.937
I'd like to just

05:06.970 --> 05:08.631
run him around
your vehlcle,

05:08.670 --> 05:10.934
just to be on
the safe side.

05:12.680 --> 05:14.898
Officer, are we
being profiled here?

05:14.940 --> 05:18.103
I... How do you mean, ma'am?
Well, I was asleep
in the backseat,

05:18.150 --> 05:22.416
and you saw two kids driving
at 8:00 in the morning.

05:22.450 --> 05:23.815
You thought maybe drugs?

05:23.850 --> 05:25.738
No.

05:25.790 --> 05:28.350
But if you don't mind,
ma'am, I'd really like

05:28.390 --> 05:31.029
to run my dog around your car,
and you'll be on your way.

05:31.060 --> 05:33.949
And if I do mind?

05:36.000 --> 05:37.968
(dog panting)

05:38.000 --> 05:40.139
GRACE:
It's like a police state.

05:40.170 --> 05:42.934
You should just
use Dad's name.
What?

05:42.970 --> 05:44.608
Why?
He'll stop
hassling us if he

05:44.640 --> 05:45.937
knows you're connected with
the state's attorney.

05:45.970 --> 05:49.076
That's Cook County.
This is Madison County,
and we don't do that.

05:49.110 --> 05:51.999
We don't use Dad's name;
we use the law.

05:53.620 --> 05:55.110
You use Dad's name?

05:55.150 --> 05:57.448
How do we use the law?

06:04.490 --> 06:06.993
Hey, Cary, it's Alicia.

06:07.030 --> 06:09.089
Do you know anyone
in Madison County's

06:09.130 --> 06:10.165
state's attorney's office?

06:10.200 --> 06:12.395
We've just been
pulled over

06:12.440 --> 06:15.762
on Interstate 55, and I think
it's a result of profiling.

06:15.800 --> 06:18.928
So I need to get
the, uh, patrol car's
dashboard camera.

06:18.970 --> 06:20.733
(giggles)
Go, Mom.
Yeah. Get him fired.

06:20.780 --> 06:22.031
You should call
his captain.

06:22.080 --> 06:23.149
CARY:
Sure. I'll see what

06:23.180 --> 06:24.579
I can do.
You got the car number?

06:24.610 --> 06:25.975
Yes. It is...

06:26.010 --> 06:29.047
4-1-9. It's an Officer Robb
and it's K-9 unit.

06:29.080 --> 06:30.047
No problem.

06:30.090 --> 06:32.411
Oh, yeah, and Eli called.

06:32.460 --> 06:33.984
Something about the interview.
Immw.

06:34.020 --> 06:36.557
Thanks, I'll call him.

06:36.590 --> 06:38.581
DAVID:
I'm not upset.
Do I sound upset?

06:38.630 --> 06:40.052
You just threatened
to sue us.

06:40.100 --> 06:42.125
No, I said I was
going to sue you.

06:42.160 --> 06:43.627
That's not a threat;
that's a fact.

06:43.670 --> 06:45.661
I'm packing up
and filing a suit.
David,

06:45.700 --> 06:46.632
this balloon payment came due

06:46.670 --> 06:48.991
at the exact moment
we lost our top cllent.

06:49.040 --> 06:51.031
We are suffering through
the worst recession...
Okay,

06:51.070 --> 06:52.139
at a certain
pomt, you have

06:52.170 --> 06:53.831
to stop with the recession talk

06:53.880 --> 06:55.836
and own this bankruptcy.

06:55.880 --> 06:58.804
WILL: Look, we definitely
have some issues to work
out internally,

06:58.850 --> 07:00.841
but if you leave now
and file suit...

07:05.220 --> 07:09.657
(heavy sigh)
Yep, always in time
for the Fall of Saigon.

07:09.690 --> 07:12.022
(car door closes)
Uh, h-hold on, Eli.

07:12.060 --> 07:13.652
Okay, here's
the thing.

07:13.700 --> 07:17.090
I run my dog around your car,
and on the passenger side,

07:17.130 --> 07:18.324
he starts scratching
and barking.

07:18.370 --> 07:22.602
I now have probable
cause to search in
the state of Illinois.

07:22.640 --> 07:24.505
But I want to give your
son one last chance,

07:24.540 --> 07:27.634
so if he has any small
personal amount of marijuana,

07:27.680 --> 07:30.103
I need to know.

07:30.150 --> 07:32.209
Search if you're
gonna search.

07:36.890 --> 07:39.916
(sighing):
Sorry, Eli.
Actually, I'm gonna be late.

07:39.960 --> 07:42.087
What? Why?
We arranged this weeks ago.

07:42.120 --> 07:44.224
Well, circumstances
are beyond my control.

07:44.260 --> 07:46.228
This is a national
sit-down, Alicia.

07:46.260 --> 07:48.148
You've got to get it
under control.

07:48.200 --> 07:49.224
Okay, got to go.

07:49.260 --> 07:51.194
Peggy.

07:51.230 --> 07:53.198
I'm just showing Peter
a campaign ad, Eli.

07:53.240 --> 07:55.060
That's all.
It's not an ambush.

07:55.100 --> 07:57.807
MIKE (on computer):
Let me just say this to Jax,
who is watching

07:57.840 --> 08:00.206
on TV right now and has been

08:00.240 --> 08:04.142
an inspiration to me
every single day of my life.

08:04.180 --> 08:07.638
My dad asked me if it was
all right if he runs,

08:07.680 --> 08:10.979
and I said yeah, 'cause
he does a really good job

08:11.020 --> 08:13.887
of taking care of me, and I
think he'd do a really good job

08:13.920 --> 08:15.080
of taking care of everyone.

08:15.120 --> 08:19.159
I am running for governor
of the great state of Illinois.

08:19.190 --> 08:21.920
So, Kresteva is making the
campaign about family values?

08:21.960 --> 08:24.190
Look, I think the
campaign's about
a lot of things:

08:24.230 --> 08:25.788
our bankrupt state,

08:25.830 --> 08:27.695
drugs coming across
the border, education...

08:27.740 --> 08:29.799
But Kresteva is
defining himself

08:29.840 --> 08:31.137
as a good father and husband,

08:31.170 --> 08:33.138
and you, in a recent deposition,

08:33.180 --> 08:35.205
are admitting that you are
separated from your wife.

08:35.240 --> 08:36.309
ELI:
Separated but working

08:36.340 --> 08:38.240
to mend fences.
Look, Peggy,

08:38.280 --> 08:39.975
this is gonna be
a long campaign.

08:40.020 --> 08:41.669
Kresteva is the
Republlcan candldate

08:41.720 --> 08:43.938
I will be facing
in four months.

08:43.990 --> 08:47.016
My goal now is to win the
Democratic nomination.

08:47.060 --> 08:48.584
The Democratic Committee
stands beside you,

08:48.620 --> 08:50.224
so isn't that a_
foregone conclu5lon?

08:50.260 --> 08:53.058
In politics, nothing is
a foregone conclusion.

08:53.100 --> 08:54.749
I win the nomination,
you can ask me

08:54.800 --> 08:58.588
all you want about Kresteva
and his attempts to, uh...

08:58.630 --> 09:00.860
redefine himself
as a family man.

09:00.900 --> 09:03.733
His "attempts"? Do I
detect a hint of sarcasm?

09:03.770 --> 09:07.331
In four months you can
detect a hint of sarcasm.

09:07.380 --> 09:11.601
ROBB:
Okay, I didn't find any drugs
at this time in your vehicle,

09:11.650 --> 09:13.345
but I did find shake,
marijuana shake,

09:13.380 --> 09:15.075
under your
front seat.
What?!

09:15.120 --> 09:17.213
My guess is this
is what my dog
was signaling.

09:17.250 --> 09:20.253
Mom, that's...
Shh, shh. Okay, um,
thank you, Officer.

09:20.290 --> 09:22.929
So, I'm gonna
give you a ticket
and a warning

09:22.960 --> 09:25.178
at this time
and let you go.

09:25.230 --> 09:27.255
So, if there's
nothing, uh...

09:30.370 --> 09:31.769
Son, raise your hand.

09:34.400 --> 09:36.163
Son, I said raise your hand.

09:36.200 --> 09:38.304
Is_ that a _
recordlng deVIce?

09:38.340 --> 09:40.137
It's-it's an iPhone.

09:40.180 --> 09:41.704
An iPhone set to record?

09:42.880 --> 09:44.609
Yes.

09:44.650 --> 09:48.177
Recording an officer
is a crime, son.

09:48.220 --> 09:49.812
Under Article 14 of the
Illinois Criminal Code,

09:49.850 --> 09:51.249
it's a Class 1 felony.
ALICIA: Actually, that

09:51.290 --> 09:53.281
was overturned in
the Seventh Circuit.
No, it wasn't.

09:53.320 --> 09:55.811
Two-party consent is still
on the books. And I ask you

09:55.860 --> 09:57.885
to erase that
recordlng rlght now.
GRACE: Wait, so it's

09:57.930 --> 09:59.329
illegal to record you
doing something illegal?

09:59.360 --> 10:01.294
I'm not doing
anything illegal,

10:01.330 --> 10:02.661
and either you
erase the recording

10:02.700 --> 10:05.191
or I'll impound the phone.

10:05.230 --> 10:06.367
Mom?

10:06.400 --> 10:07.230
Just do it, Zach.

10:07.270 --> 10:09.909
This is so wrong.
I know. Just do it.

10:09.940 --> 10:12.773
ROBB:
I need you to erase
the recording, son.

10:12.810 --> 10:14.732
Now.

10:17.050 --> 10:18.904
(iPhone whooshes)

10:21.850 --> 10:24.239
Did you just e-mail it?
ALICIA: Okay.

10:24.290 --> 10:27.088
Everyone, let's just
take a breath.
Son, did you just

10:27.120 --> 10:29.384
e-mail that recording?
It was a mistake.

10:29.420 --> 10:31.320
I did.

10:31.360 --> 10:32.998
Put your hands
behind your back.

10:48.440 --> 10:53.013
We are $60 million in debt,
Your Honor.

10:54.180 --> 10:58.139
This is mostly due to
unforeseen circumstances:

10:58.190 --> 10:59.088
the loss of a major client,

10:59.120 --> 11:01.213
late receivables
and an...

11:01.260 --> 11:04.252
exponential increase
in our lease.

11:04.290 --> 11:05.985
We believe if we are given

11:06.030 --> 11:08.123
immediate relief from
our credltors, we WIII need

11:08.160 --> 11:10.219
five months to satisfy
this debt.

11:10.270 --> 11:12.932
My son has
a felony notice to appear.

11:12.970 --> 11:14.198
He what?

11:14.240 --> 11:15.764
Why?

11:15.800 --> 11:18.268
The cop said there
was marijuana shake in the car,

11:18.310 --> 11:20.107
but that's not why.
Yeah,

11:20.140 --> 11:21.869
shake is what they say when
they don't find anything.

11:21.910 --> 11:23.901
What is this, eavesdropping?

11:23.950 --> 11:25.804
Four to 15 years.

11:25.850 --> 11:28.114
Zach was holding a cell phone
in his hand.

11:28.150 --> 11:30.118
He... Where is Zach?

11:30.150 --> 11:32.118
He's at home.

11:32.150 --> 11:34.289
But we have to appear tomorrow
for the preliminary hearing.

11:34.320 --> 11:35.753
JUDGE:
And why is Mr. Gardner

11:35.790 --> 11:37.223
not standing with you?

11:37.260 --> 11:39.797
I was suspended from the law
for six months, Your Honor.

11:39.830 --> 11:41.252
That suspension ends this week,

11:41.300 --> 11:42.449
Then I'll be fighting alongside
Miss Lockhart

11:42.500 --> 11:44.092
to restore our firm
to Its former glory.

11:44.130 --> 11:46.428
Could you talk to your friend
at Madison County,

11:46.470 --> 11:48.961
get this cop's record, see if
there's any disciplinary action.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.900
They're not gonna
pursue this, Alicia.

11:50.940 --> 11:52.202
Okay? Don't worry.

11:52.240 --> 11:54.037
The cop just wanted
to make a point.

11:54.080 --> 11:55.775
It's on Zach's record.

11:55.810 --> 11:57.903
He's looking at colleges.
Okay.

11:57.950 --> 11:59.247
I'll give my friend a call.

11:59.280 --> 12:00.816
Thank you.
JUDGE:
No, Mr. Gardner,

12:00.850 --> 12:03.819
if this were before the
Dewey & LeBoeuf bankruptcy,

12:03.850 --> 12:05.249
I'd probably approve this plan,

12:05.290 --> 12:07.155
but I see the same
management problems here

12:07.190 --> 12:09.055
of excessive debt
and compensatlon.

12:09.090 --> 12:11.923
Your Honor, no one wins
if you liquidate us.
I would agree,

12:14.400 --> 12:15.355
But we're management.

12:19.400 --> 12:21.163
WILL:
Why are we being punished

12:21.200 --> 12:22.758
for Dewey & LeBoeuf?

12:22.810 --> 12:24.334
We have to get the
partners together.

12:24.370 --> 12:25.769
Oh, no.

12:25.810 --> 12:27.107
WILL:
A new client, I forgot.

12:27.140 --> 12:29.335
We can't be turning
down new business.

12:29.380 --> 12:31.905
Cary and Alicia, we need
you to take this meeting.

12:31.950 --> 12:33.110
What is it?

12:33.150 --> 12:35.175
It's not one

12:35.220 --> 12:38.246
of_o_ur most
prestlglous cases.

12:38.290 --> 12:40.952
I own a tow truck company.

12:42.890 --> 12:45.222
Okay, and, uh,
how may we help you

12:45.260 --> 12:47.228
with that, Mr. Saverese?

12:47.260 --> 12:48.488
Nick.

12:48.530 --> 12:50.327
So what, I don't get
the partners anymore?

12:50.370 --> 12:51.428
Oh, no,

12:51.470 --> 12:55.190
uh, Diane and Will just asked us
to get some detail.

12:55.240 --> 12:56.298
Detail, sure.

12:56.340 --> 12:59.104
Okay, well,
I got a lot of detail.

12:59.140 --> 13:01.279
I'm new to town,

13:01.310 --> 13:03.141
and the government
is putting out an RFP

13:03.180 --> 13:05.239
_ to outsource _
lts tow truck serwce,

13:05.280 --> 13:06.577
but they won't let me bid.

13:06.610 --> 13:07.417
Why not?

13:07.450 --> 13:09.042
Well,

13:09.080 --> 13:11.810
I've had a bit of a problem
in my past.

13:11.850 --> 13:13.249
It's nothing big, you know,

13:13.290 --> 13:14.552
it's just, uh, just an arrest.

13:14.590 --> 13:16.182
Nick, let me stop you
right there.

13:16.220 --> 13:18.029
You don't want
to tell us anythlng

13:18.060 --> 13:19.994
that might preclude us

13:20.030 --> 13:21.327
from working on your case.

13:21.360 --> 13:22.520
(knocking on glass)

13:26.300 --> 13:28.461
Do you need to go?
No.

13:28.500 --> 13:31.003
I'm fine.
Well, here's the thing.

13:31.040 --> 13:33.975
I have two businessmen who want
to partner with me on this bid.

13:34.010 --> 13:36.899
I supply the service,
they act as middlemen.

13:36.950 --> 13:40.818
So, I need your firm to vet them
and help me choose one.

13:42.180 --> 13:43.886
Alicia?

13:43.920 --> 13:45.319
Alicia.

13:45.350 --> 13:47.318
So, how is that legal?

13:47.360 --> 13:49.453
How is... _
He wants to partner WIth
someone who doesn't have

13:49.490 --> 13:51.321
an arrest record _
so he can make a bld

13:51.360 --> 13:53.294
on a governmental contract.
Yes, and as long

13:53.330 --> 13:55.890
as we keep the bid
at arm's length, we're fine.

13:55.930 --> 13:56.999
Look,

13:57.030 --> 13:58.566
if we weren't
in such bad straights,

13:58.600 --> 14:00.295
we'd probably cut
this one loose, but...

14:00.340 --> 14:01.967
No, I get it.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.230
I just, uh, I still have one leg
in the SA's office.

14:04.270 --> 14:06.238
PEGGY:
And how long

14:06.270 --> 14:07.908
have you and your husband
been separated?

14:07.940 --> 14:08.907
ALICIA:
About a year.

14:08.940 --> 14:10.976
So, you were separated
when you stood beside him

14:11.010 --> 14:12.568
for his gubernatorial
announcement?

14:12.610 --> 14:13.975
Yes.

14:14.020 --> 14:15.476
And you didn't find
this hypocritical?

14:15.520 --> 14:17.181
No.

14:17.220 --> 14:20.656
(chuckles)
You seem to prefer
one-word answers.

14:20.690 --> 14:22.612
Yes.

14:24.230 --> 14:27.199
Your husband said that you
are working on mending fences.

14:27.230 --> 14:28.322
Is that true?

14:28.360 --> 14:29.395
It is.

14:29.430 --> 14:32.297
Can you expand on that?

14:32.330 --> 14:35.390
(sighs)

14:35.440 --> 14:38.364
My husband slept
with prostitutes.

14:38.410 --> 14:40.935
That made our
marriage difficult.

14:40.980 --> 14:42.470
But we have
children together,

14:42.510 --> 14:45.104
and my husband apologized,

14:45.150 --> 14:48.142
and I needed time to consider
whether to accept that apology.

14:48.180 --> 14:50.978
During that time, we separated.

14:51.020 --> 14:52.419
But now you're together?

14:52.450 --> 14:54.589
We're mending fences.

14:57.030 --> 14:58.327
Do you live in his house?

14:58.360 --> 15:00.396
I have my own apartment,

15:00.430 --> 15:02.421
but I also sometimes stay
at his house.

15:02.460 --> 15:03.529
In the same room?

15:04.570 --> 15:06.390
That's none of your business.

15:06.430 --> 15:08.261
Why not?

15:08.300 --> 15:10.234
Because my life is mine.

15:10.270 --> 15:11.464
But you've made
your life public,

15:11.510 --> 15:13.273
haven't you?
No.

15:13.310 --> 15:14.504
My husband has.

15:18.280 --> 15:20.111
(chuckles)

15:21.150 --> 15:22.515
So, I'd like to ask you this,

15:22.550 --> 15:25.246
ALICIA: Why do you stay
with your husband?

15:25.290 --> 15:27.451
Why not divorce?

15:27.490 --> 15:31.153
Other wives who've been betrayed
like you have divorced.

15:31.190 --> 15:32.487
Because I don't want to.

15:32.530 --> 15:34.589
Isn't that setting a bad
example to women everywhere

15:34.630 --> 15:37.098
to be such a doormat?

15:37.130 --> 15:38.097
Peggy.

15:38.130 --> 15:39.199
I like my husband.

15:39.230 --> 15:40.162
I respect him.

15:40.200 --> 15:44.500
He's flawed,
but I've grown to accept that.

15:44.540 --> 15:47.373
And I committed to a marriage.

15:47.410 --> 15:49.970
I don't like
breaking commitments.

15:50.010 --> 15:51.705
Isn't that dragging
women back to the '505?

15:51.750 --> 15:54.071
Women have all the obligation,

15:54.120 --> 15:55.269
men have all the freedom.

15:55.320 --> 15:56.548
I don't know.

15:56.580 --> 15:58.514
This isn't about women
or the '505.

15:58.550 --> 16:00.552
This is about me.

16:03.590 --> 16:05.319
Hey, there.
How's it going?

16:05.360 --> 16:06.486
ZACH:
Good.

16:06.530 --> 16:08.418
ROBB:
Can I see your driver's license,
registration...

16:11.570 --> 16:13.037
Come on, Drey.

16:13.070 --> 16:14.162
Here you go.

16:14.200 --> 16:16.191
Get it, boy.
There you go. Get it, boy.

16:16.240 --> 16:17.366
(barking)
Dig for it.

16:17.410 --> 16:18.365
What do you got, Drey?

16:18.410 --> 16:19.399
ELI:
Okay,

16:19.440 --> 16:21.271
you know how
you're not supposed

16:21.310 --> 16:23.278
to shop when
you're hungry, hmm?

16:23.310 --> 16:25.505
Well, it's just as important
not to do interviews

16:25.550 --> 16:26.471
when you're pissed.

16:26.510 --> 16:28.273
I wasn't pissed, Eli.

16:28.320 --> 16:30.242
And if you don't want me
doing interviews...
What I want

16:30.290 --> 16:32.110
is for you to stay on message.

16:32.150 --> 16:34.516
Kresteva is making this
all about family.

16:34.560 --> 16:36.414
And what's the message
about our separation?

16:38.730 --> 16:40.550
You're right, you're right.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.693
I'll set up a meeting
to discuss it.

16:42.730 --> 16:45.369
Oh, and I need you to talk

16:45.400 --> 16:48.267
to the CWA next Thursday.
I work, Eli.

16:48.300 --> 16:50.131
I'll talk to Will and Diane.
No.

16:50.170 --> 16:51.262
I want to work, Eli.

16:51.310 --> 16:52.436
Peter's free
tomorrow nlght.

16:52.470 --> 16:54.404
We'll discuss it then.

16:54.440 --> 16:56.533
ROBB:
What's that?

16:56.580 --> 16:57.672
(barking)
Good boy.

16:57.710 --> 16:59.439
What's that? Get that.
Get it, boy.

16:59.480 --> 17:00.777
Dig for it.

17:00.820 --> 17:02.310
What do you got, Drey?

17:02.350 --> 17:04.511
ALICIA:
Oh, hey, Kalinda,

17:04.550 --> 17:06.484
you have a friend
who trains canines, don't you?

17:06.520 --> 17:07.589
Yeah, why?

17:07.620 --> 17:08.814
I think I was subject

17:08.860 --> 17:10.282
to a bogus search.

17:10.330 --> 17:11.456
Can I talk to him?

17:11.490 --> 17:12.821
Her. Sure.
MAN:
What about our bonuses?

17:12.860 --> 17:14.521
(angry clamoring)

17:14.560 --> 17:16.391
The judge approved
the plan.

17:16.430 --> 17:18.466
That's the important thing;
we avoided liquidation.

17:18.500 --> 17:19.819
But...
I thought you
were leaving us,

17:19.870 --> 17:21.394
David.
And miss this?

17:21.440 --> 17:22.498
Are you kidding?

17:22.540 --> 17:25.532
DIANE:
We avoided liquidation,
but the judge assigned

17:25.570 --> 17:27.709
a trustee to supervise
our decisions.

17:27.740 --> 17:29.298
(overlapping talking)
Wait, wait.

17:29.340 --> 17:32.207
Everybody will
still get paid.

17:32.250 --> 17:34.218
Everybody will still work
on cases,

17:34.250 --> 17:37.481
but new cases will be vetted
by this trustee.

17:37.520 --> 17:39.181
Meaning he can veto you.
DIANE: In theory,

17:39.220 --> 17:40.585
but he hasn't been assigned
to us yet,

17:40.620 --> 17:41.484
so we don't know.

17:41.520 --> 17:43.624
Excuse me.
Our hope is that
this trustee

17:43.660 --> 17:45.651
will work closely with us
and that he or she

17:45.690 --> 17:48.818
will have as much invested
In our success as we do.

17:48.860 --> 17:50.396
MAN:
Excuse me?

17:50.430 --> 17:52.261
I'm Clarke Hayden.

17:52.300 --> 17:53.335
Yes?

17:53.370 --> 17:54.792
The trustee.

17:54.840 --> 17:56.660
(others muttering)

17:56.700 --> 17:58.839
And the paintings,

17:58.870 --> 18:01.270
are they leased?

18:01.310 --> 18:02.800
No, we own them.

18:03.780 --> 18:05.441
But the office
furniture is leased?

18:05.480 --> 18:06.504
Yes.

18:06.550 --> 18:08.279
Mr. Hayden,

18:08.320 --> 18:10.811
ifI could be so bold.

18:10.850 --> 18:13.114
We have a fairly
refined clientele,

18:13.160 --> 18:15.253
and if we start _
dressmg down the ofﬁce,

18:15.290 --> 18:16.552
they'll notice and leave us.

18:32.710 --> 18:34.439
I think that's enough for today.

18:34.480 --> 18:36.209
What I thought
I would do is meet

18:36.240 --> 18:37.468
with you both separately

18:37.510 --> 18:39.501
to discuss the current
stafflng Sltuatlon.

18:39.550 --> 18:42.678
Uh, what current
staffing situation?

18:42.720 --> 18:44.142
Reduction.

18:49.690 --> 18:51.282
That's from _
my personal collectlon.

18:51.330 --> 18:53.525
It's pretty.

18:53.560 --> 18:55.289
Thanks.

18:58.670 --> 19:01.230
Do you think
we've hit bottom yet?

19:01.270 --> 19:03.329
Nope.

19:05.770 --> 19:08.603
*

19:26.890 --> 19:29.791
(door closes)
ZACH:
Hey, Mom, did you know

19:29.830 --> 19:32.663
you can videotape a cop,
you just can't audiotape them?

19:32.700 --> 19:33.735
Did they teach that at school?

19:33.770 --> 19:37.604
No, it's an old law based
on taping phone calls.

19:37.640 --> 19:39.767
You had to have both parties
agree to record a call.

19:39.810 --> 19:41.778
What are you reading?
Oh, it's a Web site

19:41.810 --> 19:42.970
about my rights.

19:43.010 --> 19:44.671
It's actually pretty cool.
Yeah.

19:44.710 --> 19:45.779
Looks like
some pretty cool stuff.

19:45.810 --> 19:47.368
I'm not looking at that.

19:47.420 --> 19:48.569
Here, look.

19:48.620 --> 19:50.815
This is the e-mail
that I sent myself.

19:50.850 --> 19:52.317
I had my phone set to Bluetooth

19:52.350 --> 19:53.783
so I could play music
in the car,

19:53.820 --> 19:54.957
and I never switched it back.

19:54.990 --> 19:56.753
Okay.

19:56.790 --> 19:57.779
Well, look.

19:57.830 --> 20:00.799
This is what I shot.

20:01.660 --> 20:03.298
But listen.

20:03.330 --> 20:05.366
("Mucka Blucka" plays)

20:11.470 --> 20:13.472
(music continues)

20:18.680 --> 20:20.375
(music continues)

20:21.850 --> 20:22.839
It's a lovely song.

20:22.880 --> 20:23.915
Can we stop it now?

20:23.950 --> 20:25.781
(music stops)
Yes, Your Honor.

20:25.820 --> 20:27.959
My son never recorded audio,

20:27.990 --> 20:29.617
and there can be
no Article 14 violation

20:29.660 --> 20:32.458
without audio.

20:32.490 --> 20:34.424
Therefore, we ask this court
to enter a finding

20:34.460 --> 20:35.552
of no probable cause.

20:35.600 --> 20:37.568
That sounds right to me,
ASA Williams.

20:37.600 --> 20:38.726
MAN:
Your Honor,

20:38.770 --> 20:40.635
sorry to take over here.
ASA Altman.

20:40.670 --> 20:43.264
Uh, we would argue
that the problem here

20:43.310 --> 20:45.904
was never Article 14,
it was obstruction of justice.

20:45.940 --> 20:48.773
Excuse me, Your Honor,
but that wasn't the charge.

20:48.810 --> 20:49.834
Yes, but we would ask

20:49.880 --> 20:52.701
leave of the court
to file an additional charge.

20:52.750 --> 20:54.047
Your Honor, this is outrageous.

20:54.080 --> 20:55.718
The only one
obstructing justice

20:55.750 --> 20:57.308
is Officer Robb
with his illegal traffic stop.

20:57.350 --> 20:58.817
Your Honor,
I know Mrs. Florrick

20:58.850 --> 21:01.751
isn't from this county,
but we take unfounded charges

21:01.790 --> 21:02.882
like that very seriously.

21:02.920 --> 21:04.057
JUDGE:
Yes, we do.

21:04.090 --> 21:06.320
Do you have any evidence
to that effect,

21:06.360 --> 21:07.554
Mrs. Florrick?
I can gather it.

21:07.600 --> 21:08.692
Then gather it.

21:08.730 --> 21:11.824
And before I hear on the
obstruction of justice charge,

21:11.870 --> 21:13.758
I will hear on the legality
of the traffic stop.

21:13.800 --> 21:15.495
(gavelbangs)

21:18.110 --> 21:19.805
This is about my husband,
isn't it?

21:19.840 --> 21:22.400
Excuse me?
You want to embarrass my husband

21:22.440 --> 21:24.305
by going after my son?

21:24.350 --> 21:25.669
Mrs. Florrick,
I don't think we've met.

21:25.710 --> 21:28.508
I'm the state's attorney
for Madison County, Phil Tapia.

21:28.550 --> 21:30.609
I don't go after people.

21:30.650 --> 21:31.844
My son is 17 years old.

21:31.890 --> 21:33.755
He has nothing to do
with politics.

21:33.790 --> 21:35.485
You want to hurt Peter,

21:35.520 --> 21:36.851
I'll give you his number.

21:36.890 --> 21:38.687
Maybe you can do me the honor,
Mrs. Florrick,

21:38.730 --> 21:41.358
of talking to me like I'm not
some small-town hood.

21:41.400 --> 21:42.822
My son did nothing wrong.
He obstructed justice.

21:42.860 --> 21:45.328
After an illegal traffic stop.

21:45.370 --> 21:46.689
Well, that will be
a hard one to prove.

21:46.730 --> 21:47.765
I have to go now.

21:49.540 --> 21:51.007
And you might tell
your husband...

21:52.140 --> 21:53.835
...police love their pensions.

21:59.910 --> 22:03.641
So, am I in trouble?

22:03.690 --> 22:05.487
Not ifI can help it.

22:05.520 --> 22:06.748
Come on.

22:14.130 --> 22:16.098
WOMAN :
Petey?

22:16.130 --> 22:20.066
So the issue isn't the dog,
and it's not the trainer.

22:20.100 --> 22:21.761
The issue is the handler.

22:21.800 --> 22:24.405
So, the handler can force
a false positive?

22:24.440 --> 22:26.965
The point is, Petey doesn't
need to be encouraged.

22:27.010 --> 22:27.977
_ He'll alert_
WIthout promptlng.

22:28.010 --> 22:30.376
Now, if I wanted to create
a false positive....

22:30.410 --> 22:31.741
Let's go.

22:31.780 --> 22:32.906
Find it.
Where is it?

22:32.950 --> 22:34.440
Where is it?

22:34.480 --> 22:35.913
Where is it?
(soft bark)

22:35.950 --> 22:37.781
Find it.
What's in there, Petey?
(Petey whines)

22:37.820 --> 22:39.742
What's in there? See?
(growling)

22:39.790 --> 22:41.018
I just found probable

22:41.060 --> 22:43.426
cause to search
through your ﬁle box.

22:43.460 --> 22:44.859
ROBB:
Get it, boy. Dig for it.
(barking)

22:44.890 --> 22:46.824
What do you got, Drey? What's
in there? What's in there?

22:46.860 --> 22:47.997
That's right.

22:48.030 --> 22:50.055
That's a manufactured
false p05ltlve.

22:50.100 --> 22:51.465
Thank you very much.
Yeah.

22:51.500 --> 22:52.489
ALICIA:
Excuse me.

22:52.530 --> 22:54.361
Mm-hmm.

22:55.170 --> 22:56.990
You see, I'm a good person.

22:57.040 --> 22:59.838
I never said
you weren't.
My dogs miss you.

22:59.870 --> 23:02.737
You know, I never liked
the way they looked at me.
Oh.

23:02.780 --> 23:04.771
There was always
something a little bit...

23:07.080 --> 23:09.048
What?

23:09.080 --> 23:10.911
What is it?

23:15.860 --> 23:17.589
So...

23:17.630 --> 23:19.029
both_ are stable
busmessmen.

23:19.060 --> 23:21.449
No liens on credit,
financially secure.

23:21.500 --> 23:23.798
But due to preferential hiring

23:23.830 --> 23:25.422
in government bids,
we would suggest

23:25.470 --> 23:26.926
partnering with Mr. Wells.

23:26.970 --> 23:28.096
'Cause he's black?

23:28.140 --> 23:29.562
Yes.

23:30.610 --> 23:32.760
And who did the vetting for you?

23:32.810 --> 23:34.539
Who? Our investigator.

23:34.580 --> 23:35.831
Can I talk to him?

23:35.880 --> 23:37.575
I got a few questions.
Just details.

23:37.610 --> 23:39.578
Her, and... sure, yeah.

23:42.220 --> 23:44.415
She just took off.

23:45.690 --> 23:47.851
Um, actually, she stepped out
for the moment,

23:47.890 --> 23:50.211
but I'm sure_ we can answer
any questlons you have.

23:50.260 --> 23:53.149
No. I like to hear
from the horse's mouth.

23:53.190 --> 23:54.726
When will she be back?

23:54.760 --> 23:56.728
I don't know. Soon.
Well,

23:56.760 --> 23:58.489
let's set another appointment.

23:58.530 --> 24:02.034
It's just a few more
billable hours, right?

24:02.070 --> 24:04.061
(elevator bell dings)

24:16.180 --> 24:18.717
So?

24:21.260 --> 24:23.114
(grunting)

24:24.260 --> 24:26.558
(groans, panting)

24:26.590 --> 24:28.057
(grunting)

24:28.100 --> 24:30.694
(loud grunting)

24:30.730 --> 24:31.924
(yells)

24:31.970 --> 24:33.119
(both panting)
You like that, huh?

24:33.170 --> 24:34.592
(elevator bell dings)

24:34.640 --> 24:36.164
(Nick groans loudly)

24:36.200 --> 24:39.067
(panﬁng)

24:39.110 --> 24:40.600
(yelling)

24:40.640 --> 24:41.208
(sighs)

24:41.240 --> 24:44.004
(panﬁng)
Hmm.

24:44.050 --> 24:46.006
Hmm.

24:48.950 --> 24:51.680
(Nick grunts)

24:51.720 --> 24:52.914
(grunting)

24:52.950 --> 24:54.713
(Kalinda yells)

24:54.760 --> 24:57.149
(Nick grunts,
Kalinda yells)

24:57.190 --> 25:00.227
(panﬁng)

25:03.030 --> 25:04.998
(sighs)

25:14.180 --> 25:16.671
(Clarke taps on notebook)

25:16.710 --> 25:18.678
What does Will bring
to the table?

25:18.710 --> 25:20.177
What does Will, my partner?

25:20.210 --> 25:22.041
Yes.

25:22.080 --> 25:23.547
Everything.

25:24.920 --> 25:26.785
I guess
I don't understand the question.

25:26.820 --> 25:27.752
I'm starting at the top

25:27.790 --> 25:28.711
with these interviews
and contlnumg down.

25:28.760 --> 25:31.058
I want to get a sense
of how things work.

25:31.090 --> 25:34.196
Well, Will is the heart
and soul of litigation.

25:34.230 --> 25:36.152
Not for the last six months.
Yes. He's been

25:36.200 --> 25:38.998
suspended, which is one of the
reasons we're struggling now.

25:39.030 --> 25:40.736
You talk about him like he's
a trlal lavwer, not a partner.

25:40.770 --> 25:41.964
Just so we know here.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.900
Will's partnership is essential
to this firm.

25:43.940 --> 25:45.134
Wouldn't it be better

25:45.170 --> 25:47.206
if only one person was deciding?

25:48.240 --> 25:49.275
No. Don't answer yet.

25:49.310 --> 25:51.107
I want you
to think about it.

25:51.150 --> 25:54.916
A lot of my staffing decisions
will depend on it.

25:54.950 --> 25:56.975
ALICIA:
You guys ready

25:57.020 --> 25:58.840
to go to Dad's?
GRACE:
Yup.

25:58.890 --> 26:00.881
Um, I'm just taking this
'cause it's easier,

26:00.920 --> 26:02.751
and my room's empty at
Dad's house anyway, so...

26:02.790 --> 26:05.054
ZACH:
Mom, did you get the names
of the other people pulled over

26:05.090 --> 26:06.785
by that cop?
Not yet. I think

26:06.830 --> 26:09.151
the SA's office
is freezing us out. Why?

26:09.200 --> 26:10.895
I got a few names.
Really?

26:13.270 --> 26:14.828
Where did you find them?
Online.

26:14.870 --> 26:15.859
There's a Web site

26:15.900 --> 26:17.709
where people share stories
about police abuse,

26:17.740 --> 26:19.139
and I asked if anyone
had difficulties

26:19.170 --> 26:21.138
with an Officer Robb
on Interstate 55,

26:21.180 --> 26:23.239
and three people
responded.

26:23.280 --> 26:24.679
Here's their numbers.

26:24.710 --> 26:28.271
Zach, I'm...
I'm really impressed.

26:28.320 --> 26:30.686
I will call these tomorrow.

26:30.720 --> 26:32.244
Actually, I...

26:32.290 --> 26:33.917
You already called them?

26:33.960 --> 26:35.211
Slqped them.

26:35.260 --> 26:37.080
This one guy had
his car impounded

26:37.120 --> 26:39.384
for having a single joint
in his ashtray.

26:39.430 --> 26:41.125
And someone else

26:41.160 --> 26:42.252
had $10,000 taken.

26:42.300 --> 26:43.790
Money for a down payment,

26:43.830 --> 26:46.128
but Officer Robb suspected
it of being drug money.

26:46.170 --> 26:47.296
It's a forfeiture corridor.

26:47.330 --> 26:49.890
The police department makes
money off of drug forfeitures.

26:49.940 --> 26:52.204
They stop out-of-town cars,
check for drugs,

26:52.240 --> 26:54.299
and then impound them
if they find anything.

26:54.340 --> 26:56.137
GRACE:
Mom, Dad's here.

26:58.180 --> 27:01.308
Zach, I... I think
I have to say this again.

27:01.350 --> 27:03.318
I'm really impressed.

27:03.350 --> 27:06.319
Wow.

27:11.230 --> 27:13.858
Eli, can we have
a minute alone?

27:13.900 --> 27:16.323
Oh. Uh, don't you think we
should do this together?

27:16.360 --> 27:17.429
No, no, it's okay.

27:17.460 --> 27:19.428
But I need to know what
events you'll do together,

27:19.470 --> 27:21.131
or they're gonna ask
whether you live together...

27:21.170 --> 27:23.229
No. Just...
just a minute alone.
I really... I...

27:23.270 --> 27:24.259
(door closes)

27:24.310 --> 27:26.198
Sorry about that.

27:26.240 --> 27:28.333
Life under the microscope.

27:28.380 --> 27:30.871
I don't want the kids
doing events, Peter.

27:30.910 --> 27:32.707
I know.
Ell IS g0lng
to insist.

27:32.750 --> 27:34.377
Kresteva is putting his son
front and center.

27:34.420 --> 27:35.739
I know.

27:35.780 --> 27:37.179
No kids.

27:37.220 --> 27:39.188
Good.

27:39.220 --> 27:41.211
Thanks.

27:43.930 --> 27:45.921
So do we?

27:48.060 --> 27:49.220
Live together.

27:49.260 --> 27:51.228
(laughs)

27:51.270 --> 27:53.090
What did you tell the reporter?

27:53.130 --> 27:55.132
"None of your business."

27:56.740 --> 27:58.708
I think we should probably say

27:58.740 --> 28:01.277
that we're working on it.

28:02.380 --> 28:04.348
Are we?

28:04.380 --> 28:06.268
Well, in the sense
that nothing's

28:06.310 --> 28:08.073
definitive, yes.

28:08.120 --> 28:09.769
Why?

28:09.820 --> 28:12.380
Just helps to know the truth.

28:12.420 --> 28:13.819
Ah.

28:15.390 --> 28:17.358
Um...

28:17.390 --> 28:19.358
I need _
to tell you somethlng,

28:19.390 --> 28:21.449
_ because I think
It lnvolves you now.

28:26.300 --> 28:28.393
I want to help out
with the campaign.

28:28.440 --> 28:30.431
No.

28:32.310 --> 28:33.777
He said what?

28:33.810 --> 28:35.402
He said, "The police
like their pensions."

28:35.440 --> 28:38.443
And I told him that if he
wanted to come after you,

28:38.480 --> 28:40.744
he should leave
our son alone.

28:40.780 --> 28:42.316
Peter, I'm handling it.

28:42.350 --> 28:45.410
I don't want to make
thlngs worse, okay?

28:45.450 --> 28:47.441
Don't do anything.

28:56.200 --> 28:58.191
You met with the trustee?

28:59.230 --> 29:01.334
What did he say?

29:02.570 --> 29:05.960
He wanted to know my thoughts
on how to reduce staff.

29:06.010 --> 29:07.363
That's it?

29:07.410 --> 29:09.833
No. He...

29:15.350 --> 29:18.410
He asked whether to drop you
as a name partner.

29:18.450 --> 29:22.853
He wondered whether you were
more important as a litigator,

29:22.890 --> 29:25.324
and whether I should make
all the decisions.

29:25.360 --> 29:28.420
Yeah, he said
the same thing to me.

29:28.460 --> 29:30.826
What?
Our friend Clarke

29:30.870 --> 29:33.191
_ seems to have_ learned
hls management skllls from Mao.

29:33.230 --> 29:34.390
What did he say?

29:34.440 --> 29:36.169
I'm the true litigator.
The firm has

29:36.200 --> 29:38.839
suffered through your leadership
over the last six months.

29:38.870 --> 29:41.031
Now it needs a man at the top.

29:41.080 --> 29:43.878
He didn't say, "a man."
No.

29:43.910 --> 29:46.105
I added that to piss you off.

29:47.210 --> 29:48.438
We need to get out
from under this.

29:48.480 --> 29:51.517
But we need_ to make
$60 mllllon In ﬁve months.

29:51.550 --> 29:53.518
Which we can't do.

29:53.550 --> 29:54.983
(sighs)

29:55.020 --> 29:57.011
Not without David Lee.

30:01.100 --> 30:03.819
You have a problem with my stand
on pensions, you come to me.

30:03.870 --> 30:05.497
PHIL:
Your son was pulled over.

30:05.530 --> 30:07.464
That's all.
I'm following the law.

30:07.500 --> 30:09.832
That's right.
Same way I will with your son

30:09.870 --> 30:11.508
at the University of Chicago.

30:15.040 --> 30:17.031
So we're threatening
each other now?

30:17.080 --> 30:19.503
No. I'm threatening you.

30:19.550 --> 30:22.018
And here's a handy
little cheat sheet

30:22.050 --> 30:23.369
for the next time
you forget.

30:23.420 --> 30:25.411
I'm the state's attorney
of a county

30:25.450 --> 30:28.180
that actually matters, jackass!

30:29.220 --> 30:31.222
What do you want?

30:31.260 --> 30:32.887
Three things.

30:32.930 --> 30:35.194
Drop the case,
expunge the arrest,

30:35.230 --> 30:38.461
and tell that stupid
son-of—a-bitch of a traffic cop

30:38.500 --> 30:41.492
to call my son and apologize.

30:44.010 --> 30:45.966
Give me a day.

30:46.010 --> 30:47.637
(beep)

30:47.670 --> 30:51.606
(sighs)

30:51.650 --> 30:53.538
I did it. It's done.

30:53.580 --> 30:55.571
I don't want
to hear about it.

31:10.400 --> 31:13.028
(woman panting)

31:13.070 --> 31:15.061
(quiet sigh)

31:19.070 --> 31:21.209
You miss this.

31:21.240 --> 31:23.435
(sighs)

31:25.550 --> 31:28.212
Don't flatter yourself.

31:32.120 --> 31:34.111
(door closes)

31:35.120 --> 31:37.213
(water running)

31:41.730 --> 31:43.925
(glass clinking)

31:45.700 --> 31:47.167
Why were you
at my work?

31:47.200 --> 31:48.565
(sighs)

31:48.600 --> 31:50.158
Business.

31:50.200 --> 31:52.339
What business?

31:52.370 --> 31:54.975
Oh, you know, expanding.

31:55.010 --> 31:57.137
Becoming the tycoon.

31:57.180 --> 31:59.171
Ha!

32:04.990 --> 32:06.946
Were you robbed?

32:06.990 --> 32:09.481
I knew you were coming, so I
put everything into storage.

32:09.520 --> 32:11.681
(sighs)

32:11.730 --> 32:13.994
What? My money, too?

32:19.230 --> 32:21.539
(sighs)

32:21.570 --> 32:24.300
So you don't
love me anymore.

32:24.340 --> 32:27.264
I want you gone.

32:34.480 --> 32:37.040
What about dinner tomorrow?

32:37.080 --> 32:39.685
Nick... I want you gone.

32:41.290 --> 32:43.281
From Chicago forever.

32:43.320 --> 32:44.548
Yeah, with you.

32:44.590 --> 32:46.387
You're coming home.

32:46.430 --> 32:48.227
No, I'm not
coming.

32:48.260 --> 32:50.353
I forgive you, okay?

32:50.400 --> 32:52.493
I just can't stay angry at you.

32:52.530 --> 32:54.430
Well, things have changed.

32:54.470 --> 32:56.688
You see this?

32:56.740 --> 32:59.334
It's my new tattoo.

32:59.370 --> 33:01.235
That is the midnight sun,

33:01.280 --> 33:03.271
and I got it for you.

33:04.350 --> 33:06.341
Means "new beginning."

33:06.380 --> 33:08.268
It's over.

33:08.320 --> 33:11.414
You know why
it's not over.

33:11.450 --> 33:13.111
You could've run.

33:13.150 --> 33:15.118
You knew I was coming...

33:15.160 --> 33:18.152
(zips zipper)
but you stayed.

33:29.340 --> 33:31.262
(door opens)

33:31.310 --> 33:33.631
ALICIA:
Will. Hi. Is everything okay?

33:33.670 --> 33:36.434
Yeah. How you doing?
Good.

33:36.480 --> 33:37.538
I've just been...

33:37.580 --> 33:41.141
well, we've been running around
in separate worlds.

33:41.180 --> 33:43.569
We have.
Well, if there's
anything I can do...

33:48.720 --> 33:51.587
You were interviewed by
a reporter a few days ago?

33:51.630 --> 33:53.655
Yes. Peggy Byrne.

33:53.690 --> 33:57.353
Right. Is there anything
I should know about that?

33:58.530 --> 34:01.465
About my interview? No.

34:01.500 --> 34:02.728
She wants to talk to me.

34:02.770 --> 34:04.203
To you?

34:04.240 --> 34:06.538
She wants to know how we...

34:06.570 --> 34:08.401
work together.

34:09.810 --> 34:12.608
Well, she... I don't think...

34:12.650 --> 34:15.574
She probably just wants
a fuller picture.
Yes.

34:15.620 --> 34:17.747
I suggested she talk
to Diane, but...

34:17.780 --> 34:19.384
she said she wanted me.

34:19.420 --> 34:21.752
Well, I don't think that she...

34:21.790 --> 34:23.417
Knows about us?
Yes.

34:25.590 --> 34:27.558
We were... pretty careful.

34:27.590 --> 34:29.558
It's probably nothing.

34:38.640 --> 34:41.473
Did you have
a dog here yesterday?

34:41.510 --> 34:44.274
Yes. Long story.

34:44.310 --> 34:46.471
Hey, your suspension
ends tonight,

34:46.510 --> 34:47.738
doesn't it?
It does.

34:47.780 --> 34:48.747
Welcome back.

34:48.780 --> 34:49.872
Thanks.

34:49.920 --> 34:51.547
Uh, Will?

34:51.590 --> 34:54.411
I wonder if you
shouldn't talk to her.

34:54.460 --> 34:56.655
The reporter?
I was gonna
blow her off.

34:56.690 --> 34:57.782
Too busy.

34:57.820 --> 34:59.481
(softly):
Probably best.

34:59.530 --> 35:01.259
Don't worry.

35:01.300 --> 35:02.449
I got it.

35:05.730 --> 35:07.595
DAVID:
I'm out the door.

35:07.630 --> 35:09.734
I know.
So this interview is

35:09.770 --> 35:11.909
a bit pointless,
unless you want me
to tell you

35:11.940 --> 35:14.773
where all the bodies
are buried. (chuckles)

35:16.280 --> 35:17.736
So, what do you want?

35:17.780 --> 35:19.771
You're one of our creditors now.

35:19.810 --> 35:21.641
Your creditor?
I like to identify

35:21.680 --> 35:23.147
with the firm.

35:23.180 --> 35:26.616
Well, then yes,
I am owed $1 million

35:26.650 --> 35:28.254
for my capital contribution,

35:28.290 --> 35:30.588
my yearly draw is five percent,

35:30.620 --> 35:33.521
and so I am owed
approximately $3 million.

35:33.560 --> 35:36.654
Hm. It's good that
you're leaving, then.

35:36.700 --> 35:38.668
"It's good."
What do you mean?

35:38.700 --> 35:40.793
It's less of a burden.
Five cents on the dollar

35:40.830 --> 35:42.798
makes it $150,000.
No.

35:42.840 --> 35:46.708
I was a partner-- first money in
is first money out.

35:46.740 --> 35:49.800
Mm-hmm, for partners--
but you'll be a creditor.

35:49.840 --> 35:51.341
So thank you.

35:51.380 --> 35:52.574
Wait a minute.

35:52.610 --> 35:54.475
I'll be a creditor
ln name only.

35:54.520 --> 35:56.670
I put up
the capital contribution.

35:56.720 --> 35:59.188
Yes, and thank you.
Good luck.

35:59.220 --> 36:00.881
Wait.

36:02.260 --> 36:04.319
80 cents on the dollar.

36:04.360 --> 36:05.759
Mr. Lee, you misunderstand me.

36:05.790 --> 36:07.485
I'm not negotiating.

36:07.530 --> 36:09.225
You'll get five cents
on the dollar,

36:09.260 --> 36:11.728
and you'll get it last--
after we pay off the lease,

36:11.770 --> 36:13.567
the furniture,
the bottled water delivery,

36:13.600 --> 36:15.295
then we'll get to you.

36:15.340 --> 36:17.296
Why?

36:17.340 --> 36:19.467
I don't like people who quit.

36:31.620 --> 36:32.882
What do you got, Drey?
What's in there?

36:32.920 --> 36:34.785
What's in there?
Good, boy.

36:34.820 --> 36:37.357
Your Honor, Officer Robb creates
false positives in order

36:37.390 --> 36:39.654
to search cars for drugs...
ALTMAN:
What does this have to do

36:39.690 --> 36:40.588
with obstruction of justice,
Your Honor?

36:40.630 --> 36:41.858
There was no obstruction,
there was only

36:41.900 --> 36:44.391
an illegal impounding
of my son's cell phone.
Oh, come on.

36:44.430 --> 36:47.422
This section of
the interstate is a
forfeiture corridor,

36:47.470 --> 36:49.791
a place where the police and the
state's attorney, Phil Tapia,

36:49.840 --> 36:52.707
make their money from
the war on drugs by
illegally impounding cars

36:52.740 --> 36:54.059
and cash.

36:54.110 --> 36:56.829
We have witnesses
who haven't received
their cars and cash back

36:56.880 --> 37:00.270
after stops by Ofﬁcer Robb.
Maybe it's
not a problem

37:00.310 --> 37:02.949
in Mrs. Florrick's county,
but we have a drug problem
in Madison County.

37:02.980 --> 37:04.584
Then why are
all these stops

37:04.620 --> 37:06.918
being made on
the north-running side?

37:06.950 --> 37:09.612
My son checked
these traffic stops

37:09.660 --> 37:11.628
resulting in
drug searches.

37:11.660 --> 37:13.628
Over the last
SIX months,

37:13.660 --> 37:16.527
90% of them were made
on the north-running side

37:16.560 --> 37:18.699
of the highway.
Why is that important?

37:18.730 --> 37:20.869
Because all the drugs
are coming from the
Canadian border

37:20.900 --> 37:22.993
down the south-running side.

37:23.040 --> 37:26.362
And all the money made
from these drug sales
heads up the north.

37:26.410 --> 37:28.435
They're not trying
to stop drugs.

37:28.480 --> 37:29.799
They're trying to confiscate

37:29.840 --> 37:31.603
the money made
from these drug sales.

37:31.650 --> 37:33.003
That is an outrageous lie,
Your Honor.

37:33.050 --> 37:33.903
Mr. State's Attorney...

37:33.950 --> 37:35.269
Your Honor, these are

37:35.320 --> 37:36.810
very serious allegations.

37:36.850 --> 37:37.669
That's putting it lightly.

37:37.720 --> 37:40.018
And we intend to refute them.
We ask for

37:40.050 --> 37:42.052
a trial date to give us
time to prepare.

37:42.090 --> 37:43.853
For what? For the obstruction
of justlce charge,

37:43.890 --> 37:45.050
or for the impounding?

37:45.090 --> 37:47.388
The obstruction charge,
of course.

37:51.600 --> 37:52.897
*
We can do this.

37:52.930 --> 37:54.466
Together we can do it.

37:54.500 --> 37:56.798
Thank you for coming out.

37:56.840 --> 37:59.559
PHIL:
You send your wife against me?

37:59.610 --> 38:00.907
What?
You think

38:00.940 --> 38:02.635
Cook County is
above our problems?

38:02.680 --> 38:03.931
Get off my bus.
You came after

38:03.980 --> 38:05.504
my forfeiture corridor.
I don't know what

38:05.550 --> 38:06.801
you're talking about.
We are coming after

38:06.850 --> 38:09.375
your son to the fullest extent
of the law.

38:09.420 --> 38:11.945
You want to come
after my corrldor,
I'll come after yours.

38:11.990 --> 38:15.414
My guess is your haul on I-94
is ten times what mine is.

38:15.460 --> 38:17.348
And_I'm not the one
runnlng for governor.

38:17.390 --> 38:19.381
*

38:29.640 --> 38:32.529
I just want to say
I decided to stay.

38:32.570 --> 38:35.539
You've shown me loyalty; I want
to show you the same in return.

38:35.580 --> 38:36.933
Can't wait to get started.

38:42.050 --> 38:44.348
Just wanted to tell you,

38:44.390 --> 38:46.813
I'm staying.
Talk to you later.

38:52.460 --> 38:53.950
Did you...?

38:53.990 --> 38:56.322
Yes. What happened?

38:57.160 --> 38:59.060
What?

38:59.100 --> 39:01.864
WILL:
I don't know.

39:01.900 --> 39:04.630
Maybe Mao's not so bad
if he works for you.

39:14.480 --> 39:17.415
(Kalinda gasping)

39:17.450 --> 39:18.519
KaHnda.
Hmm?

39:18.550 --> 39:20.415
You okay?

39:20.450 --> 39:21.883
Yeah. Good.

39:21.920 --> 39:23.911
We have another meeting
with that new client.

39:23.960 --> 39:26.554
Um, could you sit in?
He's got some questions

39:26.590 --> 39:28.592
about the vetting.
The new client?

39:28.630 --> 39:30.393
Mr. Tow Truck.
Saverese.

39:30.430 --> 39:32.421
He asked for you yesterday,
but you stepped out.

39:32.470 --> 39:34.358
He'll be in in an hour.

39:35.470 --> 39:38.906
Wow, you are really
somewhere else today.

39:38.940 --> 39:41.135
(sighs):
Yeah.

39:41.170 --> 39:42.774
Yeah, I'll-I'll sit in.

39:42.810 --> 39:44.778
Okay, good.
Hey.

39:44.810 --> 39:46.505
Good job with the video.

39:46.550 --> 39:47.608
I would have
never thought of that.

39:47.650 --> 39:50.175
What? What video?
The one online

39:50.220 --> 39:52.541
about your traffic stop.

39:52.590 --> 39:54.512
Smart, like
"Breakfast in Collinsville."

39:56.760 --> 39:59.649
...a ticket and a warning
at this time and let you go.

39:59.690 --> 40:01.021
So, if there's nothing...

40:02.830 --> 40:04.559
ZACH:
Meet Officer Robb.

40:04.600 --> 40:05.862
a four-year veteran

40:05.900 --> 40:07.868
of the Madison County
Police Department,

40:07.900 --> 40:09.162
and a real putz.

40:09.200 --> 40:11.134
(horror movie music plays)

40:11.170 --> 40:12.159
(woman screams)

40:12.210 --> 40:14.201
ROBB:
Could I see

40:14.240 --> 40:16.435
your driver's license,
registration, proof
of insurance?

40:16.480 --> 40:17.469
GRACE:
What'd we do wrong?

40:17.510 --> 40:19.978
ZACH: It turns out
we did nothing wrong--

40:20.010 --> 40:21.910
except get stopped
by Officer Robb.

40:21.950 --> 40:23.941
*

40:35.800 --> 40:38.689
*

40:38.730 --> 40:42.939
* Good morning,
here's the news *

40:42.970 --> 40:45.165
* And all of it is good

40:45.210 --> 40:47.929
* And the weather's good!
(phone ringing)

40:52.210 --> 40:53.245
Hello?

40:53.280 --> 40:55.248
This is Officer Curtis Robb.

40:55.280 --> 40:57.475
Is this Zachary Florrick?

41:00.050 --> 41:01.859
Yes.

41:03.890 --> 41:05.881
I wanted to say...

41:05.930 --> 41:07.784
I'm sorry...

41:07.830 --> 41:09.855
about pulling you over.

41:09.900 --> 41:11.527
I was wrong.

41:13.070 --> 41:14.537
Really?

41:14.570 --> 41:16.697
Yeah, I think
we're dropping the case,

41:16.740 --> 41:18.560
and expunging your arrest.

41:18.610 --> 41:21.170
And... that's it.

41:21.210 --> 41:22.837
Okay?

41:22.880 --> 41:24.131
Okay.

41:24.180 --> 41:25.545
Great.

41:25.580 --> 41:27.673
I'm going now.

41:27.710 --> 41:29.473
(line clicks)

41:33.250 --> 41:36.253
500,000 views? Really?

41:36.290 --> 41:38.588
Kids.

41:38.630 --> 41:40.621

41:50.100 --> 41:53.729
WOMAN:
Hi. I'm Kitty,
and I'm ready-- to talk...

41:53.770 --> 41:57.035
I've, uh, given it
some thought.

41:57.080 --> 41:58.570
I need Will.

41:58.610 --> 42:01.078
_ It can't be
just one partner.

42:01.110 --> 42:03.146
Lockhart & Associates?

42:03.180 --> 42:04.272
No.

42:04.320 --> 42:06.288
We're a team.

42:06.320 --> 42:07.810
All right.

42:07.850 --> 42:09.818
Then come tomorrow
ready to work.

42:09.860 --> 42:12.681
We have to cut 30%
from the staff.

42:15.330 --> 42:17.150
Oh.

42:17.200 --> 42:19.794
*

42:19.830 --> 42:21.832
Ready?

42:23.000 --> 42:24.729
Five, four,

42:24.770 --> 42:26.931
three, two, one.

42:31.680 --> 42:33.671
You're a lavwer again.

42:33.710 --> 42:35.075
(sighs)

42:36.880 --> 42:38.586
Just like that.

42:42.960 --> 42:44.757
An odd year, huh?

42:44.790 --> 42:47.327
I think we're heading
towards an even odder one.

42:50.300 --> 42:52.097
(footsteps approaching)

42:52.130 --> 42:54.121
