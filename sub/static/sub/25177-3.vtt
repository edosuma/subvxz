<i>Previously, on </i> Cloak & Dagger...

00:08.790 --> 00:10.039
<i>Tandy, focus.</i>

00:10.040 --> 00:11.829
Research and Development, please.

00:12.880 --> 00:14.879
Daddy!

00:14.880 --> 00:17.379
<i>You said you were scared,
so I thought I'd do it for you.</i>

00:17.380 --> 00:18.829
Look, man, we're gonna
go take this back.

00:20.080 --> 00:21.120
Billy!

00:27.961 --> 00:30.669
- What did you do to me?
- What did I do? What was that?

00:30.670 --> 00:33.380
Things must be getting tough
because Tandy's gonna run away.

00:35.620 --> 00:38.540
<i>If you give me a chance,
I'll love you, always.</i>

00:40.420 --> 00:41.903
Tandy, are you okay?

00:41.960 --> 00:43.356
All this anger inside of me.

00:43.380 --> 00:45.245
What if I could find
the person who caused it?

00:45.270 --> 00:47.128
It's not anger, it's poison,

00:47.210 --> 00:49.651
<i>coursing through your veins every day.</i>

00:50.170 --> 00:51.619
<i>And when that bottle gets shook up...</i>

01:56.930 --> 01:59.696
Probably
have a concussion or something...

01:59.758 --> 02:01.032
Calm down, all right? I'm not trying...

02:01.057 --> 02:02.830
Are you trying to kill me?

02:03.653 --> 02:05.442
No, why would you ask that?

02:05.647 --> 02:07.857
'Cause you have a gun in your hand.

02:10.827 --> 02:13.395
Wait. You're that kid.

02:13.960 --> 02:16.000
From the party.

02:17.120 --> 02:20.580
The graveyard. The beach.

02:22.170 --> 02:24.249
- You shot at me.
- That wasn't meant for you.

02:24.250 --> 02:26.080
Then who was it meant for?

02:26.920 --> 02:28.999
You know what? Don't tell me.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.846
Look, I don't even know how to ex...

02:32.096 --> 02:34.355
One second I was in the city,
the next I was here...

02:34.380 --> 02:35.737
in the middle of nowhere,

02:35.830 --> 02:39.922
and a car... your car... was headed...

02:39.960 --> 02:42.602
Wait. What are you doin'?

02:42.655 --> 02:44.133
Getting the hell out of here.

02:44.180 --> 02:45.999
You can't drive.
Who knows what injuries...

02:48.469 --> 02:50.756
Oh my God. Is that...?

02:50.790 --> 02:53.092
Yeah.

02:54.120 --> 02:57.232
Don't take this personally, but...

02:57.700 --> 03:00.474
I hope I never see you again.

03:45.960 --> 03:48.398
Is, uh, now a bad time, Mr. Cotton?

03:48.500 --> 03:50.608
Detective O'Reilly, right?

03:50.741 --> 03:52.669
My uncle works
for the Police Foundation.

03:52.670 --> 03:55.519
He told me you're trying
to find whoever did this.

03:55.713 --> 03:57.513
Can I ask you some questions
about the attack?

03:58.540 --> 04:00.079
Anything to catch the bad guy.

04:00.080 --> 04:02.089
Guy. So you saw him?

04:02.292 --> 04:04.459
I'm embarrassed to say that I didn't.

04:04.460 --> 04:06.914
Uh, me and my boys
had gone out pretty hard,

04:06.992 --> 04:10.055
and the whole night's, uh...
I don't know, kind of fuzzy.

04:10.203 --> 04:12.960
You, uh, you got some cuts on your face.

04:14.710 --> 04:16.249
How'd you get those?

04:16.250 --> 04:17.844
Happened when I fell.

04:18.452 --> 04:20.709
They look like fingernail scratches.

04:22.380 --> 04:23.669
Fingernail scratches?

04:23.670 --> 04:25.750
We call them "defensive wounds."

04:27.080 --> 04:28.880
Why were your pants unbuckled?

04:30.210 --> 04:31.669
I'm sorry. What?

04:31.670 --> 04:32.879
The paramedics on duty that night,

04:32.880 --> 04:34.468
they told me your pants were unbuckled.

04:34.790 --> 04:36.830
Are you serious?

04:41.710 --> 04:43.531
You know what?

04:43.750 --> 04:45.570
I should probably get some rest.

04:45.684 --> 04:47.513
I'm in a lot of pain.

04:47.710 --> 04:49.614
We don't want that.

04:49.750 --> 04:51.290
I'll see you soon.

05:39.210 --> 05:40.829
Tandy, you okay?

05:40.939 --> 05:41.975
Yeah.

05:42.080 --> 05:44.829
- I'm fine.
- What are you doing here?

05:44.936 --> 05:46.290
What?

05:47.380 --> 05:49.679
I mean, credit where credit is due.

05:49.830 --> 05:52.039
You have some nerve coming back here,

05:52.078 --> 05:53.344
after that riot act you read me.

05:53.399 --> 05:55.602
Mom, can we please
not do this right now?

05:55.657 --> 05:58.040
Oh, is now not a good time for you?

05:59.040 --> 06:01.415
Sorry to interrupt your busy...

06:01.474 --> 06:03.014
What?

06:03.670 --> 06:05.999
- Mom. Mom, it's...
- My God, you're bleeding.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.033
- Again?
- It's nothing. I'm fine.

06:08.080 --> 06:09.322
- What is going on?
- Mom.

06:09.361 --> 06:11.033
New Orleans Police.

06:11.106 --> 06:12.475
Ms. Bowen, are you home?

06:12.687 --> 06:14.687
What are the police doing here?

06:17.920 --> 06:19.660
What have you done?

06:19.750 --> 06:21.119
Mom.

06:26.830 --> 06:28.511
Ms. Bowen?

06:28.620 --> 06:30.183
What can I do for you, Officer?

06:30.250 --> 06:32.503
Detective. O'Reilly.

06:32.620 --> 06:34.269
I'm looking for your daughter, Tandy?

06:34.330 --> 06:35.830
Is she around?

06:40.330 --> 06:42.447
I haven't seen her in weeks.

06:42.596 --> 06:44.502
Months, maybe.

06:44.750 --> 06:47.540
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely positive.

06:49.380 --> 06:51.055
Do you mind if I come inside?

06:51.094 --> 06:54.251
- You want to come inside?
- If you don't mind.

06:54.580 --> 06:56.500
Warrant.

06:57.960 --> 06:59.710
I'm sorry?

07:00.880 --> 07:03.460
You can't come in here
without a warrant.

07:04.460 --> 07:05.789
And who's that?

07:05.790 --> 07:06.879
It's my lawyer.

07:06.880 --> 07:08.499
Technically, I'm just representing her

07:08.500 --> 07:10.079
in a posthumous wrongful termination,

07:10.080 --> 07:12.579
but this is pretty basic lawyer crap.

07:12.652 --> 07:15.169
I'm not here to arrest
your daughter, Ms. Bowen.

07:15.238 --> 07:17.606
I'm here because I think she's a victim.

07:17.710 --> 07:19.356
Of what?

07:19.436 --> 07:21.783
The best I can tell,
she's been mixed up in an assault.

07:21.884 --> 07:25.431
I want to protect her,
I can promise you that.

07:25.710 --> 07:28.837
But in order for me to do
that, I need to talk to her.

07:29.040 --> 07:30.749
Here's the thing about Tandy:

07:30.835 --> 07:33.897
If there's any heat on her,
she's probably already run away.

07:33.967 --> 07:36.624
Well, if you happen to see her again,

07:36.670 --> 07:38.330
here's my card.

07:39.580 --> 07:40.880
You have a nice morning.

07:50.710 --> 07:51.999
She's gone.

07:52.273 --> 07:53.893
You can come out.

07:56.620 --> 07:57.920
Tandy?

Hey. Hey, listen.
Don't... Don't move. Okay?

11:35.802 --> 11:37.919
You probably have a concussion
or somethin' like that.

11:37.920 --> 11:40.412
Hey. Calm down.

11:40.540 --> 11:43.412
- All right? I'm not gonna...
- Are you tryin' to kill me?

11:43.500 --> 11:45.250
No. Why would you ask that?

11:47.716 --> 11:49.790

11:54.122 --> 11:56.357
Wait. You're that kid.

11:56.756 --> 11:58.052
From the party.

11:59.436 --> 12:02.726
The graveyard. The beach.

12:04.820 --> 12:06.739
- You shot at me.
- That wasn't meant for you.

12:06.792 --> 12:08.252
Who was it meant for?

12:09.412 --> 12:10.991
You know what? Don't tell me.

12:10.992 --> 12:12.952
Look. I don't even...

12:14.848 --> 12:16.267
One second I was in the city,

12:16.292 --> 12:18.051
the next, I was here
in the middle of nowhere,

12:18.076 --> 12:21.622
then a car... your car... was headed...

12:21.752 --> 12:24.041
- What are you doin'?
- Getting the hell out of here.

12:24.138 --> 12:26.372
Look, you can't drive.
Who knows what injuries...

12:29.598 --> 12:30.723
Oh my God. Is that...?

12:30.770 --> 12:32.791
Yeah.

12:32.792 --> 12:35.202
Don't take this the wrong way, but...

12:35.702 --> 12:37.655
I hope I never see you again.

13:00.042 --> 13:01.162
Hello?

13:10.492 --> 13:12.292
Are you in here, Father?

13:32.542 --> 13:33.992
So, uh...

13:36.292 --> 13:37.872
Not sure if you can hear me.

13:39.551 --> 13:42.091
I could just be talkin' to nothin'.

13:44.662 --> 13:46.492
What's happenin' to me?

13:47.702 --> 13:49.495
Are you doin' this?

13:49.752 --> 13:51.252
Because...

13:53.752 --> 13:56.096
I... don't understand.

13:56.332 --> 13:58.702
And... I... I can't control it.

13:59.832 --> 14:01.252
And...

14:02.872 --> 14:04.702
I can't control myself.

14:08.702 --> 14:10.542
You always had the answers.

14:12.615 --> 14:13.745
Knew what to do.

14:18.832 --> 14:20.622
What should I do?

14:22.943 --> 14:25.323
Tell me, and... and I'll do it.

14:29.081 --> 14:31.001
I miss you so much, Billy.

14:34.952 --> 14:38.332
I'm... I'm trying to be like you, but...

14:40.542 --> 14:42.847
I'm failing.

14:43.252 --> 14:47.662
And... and I'm... I'm flailing.

14:51.582 --> 14:53.813
And I'm cursed.

14:54.019 --> 14:56.774
Hi. Sorry.

14:56.805 --> 15:00.000
I didn't mean to interrupt or anything.
I was just looking for you,

15:00.031 --> 15:02.938
and I thought you...
You know, I'm just gonna stop,

15:02.985 --> 15:05.655
before I sound like I was
stalking you, which I wasn't.

15:06.155 --> 15:07.621
So...

15:07.756 --> 15:09.319
It's all right.

15:09.542 --> 15:11.042
How much did you hear?

15:12.372 --> 15:14.332
Do you really think you're cursed?

15:16.832 --> 15:19.436
I know... it sounds stupid.

15:19.542 --> 15:21.475
Not to me.

15:21.582 --> 15:24.122
In fact, there's someone I know
who might be able to help.

15:26.122 --> 15:28.415
What are you doing after school?

16:00.074 --> 16:01.613
There he is!

16:01.661 --> 16:03.153
Our last straggler.

16:03.198 --> 16:04.858
We'd almost given up hope.

16:06.081 --> 16:08.865
Welcome, true believers
and skeptics alike,

16:08.890 --> 16:10.404
to the Damballah Voodoo Tour.

16:10.459 --> 16:14.658
This is Congo Square, one of the
birthplaces of New Orleans voodoo.

16:14.771 --> 16:17.475
On Sundays, in the 18th
and 19th centuries,

16:17.539 --> 16:20.920
this was the only place the enslaved
were allowed to congregate.

16:21.039 --> 16:24.079
So they came here
to play music and dance...

16:25.201 --> 16:27.552
and practice sacred voodoo rituals,

16:27.631 --> 16:30.718
that protect, guide and cleanse.

16:30.869 --> 16:32.659
Some even remove curses.

16:34.079 --> 16:35.779
Now during its heyday, New Orleans

16:35.803 --> 16:37.803
was the dueling capital of the world.

16:38.119 --> 16:40.695
The last duel ever to be held
in the city of New Orleans

16:40.758 --> 16:45.211
was right here by, famously,
the brothers Wilson, in 1793.

16:45.369 --> 16:47.718
It's unknown the exact
reason why they drew weapons

16:47.773 --> 16:49.321
against each other,

16:49.381 --> 16:52.077
but we do know it happened
in the middle of a hurricane.

16:53.119 --> 16:56.658
But it's said that when one
fired, and the other didn't,

16:56.728 --> 16:58.803
sacrificing his life for his brother...

17:00.337 --> 17:02.509
...the hurricane ended in an instant.

17:04.237 --> 17:06.782
The history of St. Theresa's Church,
over yonder,

17:06.829 --> 17:08.650
is the history of New Orleans.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.936
It's been destroyed and rebuilt,

17:10.962 --> 17:12.157
destroyed and rebuilt.

17:12.159 --> 17:14.742
So you see, there are some places,
just like there are some people,

17:14.767 --> 17:16.626
that will always stand back up.

17:16.709 --> 17:19.383
And that church is the very church

17:19.454 --> 17:23.438
that the most famous of all
voodoo priestesses worshiped at.

17:24.209 --> 17:25.867
Now most people are surprised

17:25.892 --> 17:28.258
when they learn that
Marie Leveau was Catholic.

17:28.329 --> 17:31.439
But, you see, voodoo isn't
necessarily its own religion.

17:31.499 --> 17:32.918
That's a common misconception.

17:33.064 --> 17:35.924
Voodoo is, at its core,

17:36.322 --> 17:39.875
a diverse collection
of religious and cultural traditions

17:39.938 --> 17:43.485
that can either stand alone
or be added to your faith.

17:44.369 --> 17:47.297
Just as it was for Ms. Laveau.

17:47.619 --> 17:50.798
You may be wondering why there are
so many markings on her tomb.

17:50.919 --> 17:53.150
It's said that,
even from beyond the veil,

17:53.212 --> 17:54.955
she grants wishes.

17:55.001 --> 17:57.081
Now, can I get a volunteer?

17:59.983 --> 18:01.063
You there.

18:02.369 --> 18:04.464
Step on up.

18:04.619 --> 18:06.499
Come on, don't be shy.

18:08.539 --> 18:11.829
First, an "X" is made
on the wall of the tomb.

18:21.619 --> 18:25.323
Now, turn around three times.

18:35.419 --> 18:37.030
Take a deep breath.

18:37.119 --> 18:38.498
Make your wish.

18:38.561 --> 18:40.358
And clap your hands once,

18:40.872 --> 18:42.282
and only once.

18:58.420 --> 18:59.919
All right, right in here, guys.

18:59.959 --> 19:01.119
Okay.

19:03.225 --> 19:06.242
So this is your, um, family business?

19:06.281 --> 19:08.461
It pays that tuition of ours.

19:08.563 --> 19:09.579
It's cool.

19:10.765 --> 19:12.625
Do you believe in it?

19:13.249 --> 19:16.810
As much as I believe in the stories
we hear in chapel, I suppose.

19:16.841 --> 19:18.365
But the good news is, you don't actually

19:18.390 --> 19:20.310
have to believe in it for it to work.

19:22.419 --> 19:25.249
Come on. There's someone
I want you to meet.

19:26.546 --> 19:27.579
Come on.

19:29.369 --> 19:31.241
Auntie?

19:31.834 --> 19:33.833
This is the boy I was telling you about.

19:33.928 --> 19:36.004
Tyrone, this is my auntie.

19:36.730 --> 19:40.002
These damn little pirate birds are
stealin' my frozen watermelons.

19:40.027 --> 19:41.887
Ma'am?

19:41.934 --> 19:44.434
Ah. Heh-heh-heh.

19:44.474 --> 19:46.757
Gotcha. Aww.

19:46.834 --> 19:47.902
Gotcha.

19:47.935 --> 19:48.974
Bam.

19:50.344 --> 19:51.514
Gotcha.

19:52.819 --> 19:53.899
Don't touch.

19:55.085 --> 19:57.344
Some of those are as old as the city.

19:59.844 --> 20:01.974
Come here, boy, and lemme look at you.

20:05.349 --> 20:06.349
Mm.

20:08.753 --> 20:10.792
I don't know about this one, Evita.

20:10.856 --> 20:12.395
Why not?

20:12.541 --> 20:14.885
He doesn't think he deserves help.

20:14.976 --> 20:16.714
What? This...

20:16.865 --> 20:20.802
<i>Notre Père, qui es aux cieux,</i>

20:20.936 --> 20:23.873
<i>Que ton nom soit sanctifié...</i>

20:25.085 --> 20:26.965
<i>Que ton règne vienne.</i>

20:29.856 --> 20:30.896
Hm.

20:32.766 --> 20:34.494
The joker.

20:34.646 --> 20:37.025
Both the hopes and the fears position.

20:37.146 --> 20:38.572
Which one is it?

20:38.646 --> 20:39.741
Hopes or fears?

20:39.766 --> 20:41.915
Some would say they're the same.

20:42.056 --> 20:43.699
What does that mean?

20:43.936 --> 20:45.476
You need a bath.

20:47.896 --> 20:49.699
Did I just...?

20:49.766 --> 20:51.418
It's like a cleansing bath, all right?

20:51.464 --> 20:53.355
It's a Voudon tradition.

20:53.356 --> 20:55.243
Cleanse away any evil spirits.

20:55.936 --> 20:57.907
Okay, a bath.

20:58.261 --> 21:00.563
Isn't there something else we could do?

21:00.691 --> 21:03.757
I could hit you over the
head, give you a concussion.

21:04.096 --> 21:06.095
Both open up the mind
past the conscious,

21:06.120 --> 21:08.300
so you can walk in the Land of the Loa.

21:08.436 --> 21:11.476
Clears the spiritual sinuses,
so to speak.

21:12.896 --> 21:14.816
I prefer the bath.

21:18.726 --> 21:21.305
Milk, lavender, anise,

21:21.436 --> 21:23.188
white yarrow.

21:23.316 --> 21:25.723
What, are we gonna forage
into the woods or something?

21:25.766 --> 21:28.895
Hm. There's a place you can go
to get all these things.

21:28.936 --> 21:30.516
And where is that?

21:39.356 --> 21:41.055
It doesn't matter how
many leaves you turn over

21:41.056 --> 21:43.015
if the other side is oily.
It's about optics,

21:43.016 --> 21:45.386
and this commercial
is a great opportunity...

21:47.976 --> 21:50.815
Right. But you need real people,
who really work at the company

21:50.816 --> 21:53.219
and are sympathetic,
like, uh, single moms

21:53.244 --> 21:55.619
or veterans or nature lovers or...

21:55.686 --> 21:58.016
What's the name of that scientist?

22:02.396 --> 22:03.816
Come on.

22:13.856 --> 22:15.359
So now what?

22:15.766 --> 22:17.356
Now you get naked.

22:37.856 --> 22:39.976
Uh, totally naked.

22:55.896 --> 22:57.632
Is this it?

22:57.726 --> 22:59.178
You gotta relax.

22:59.266 --> 23:00.686
Close your eyes.

23:04.606 --> 23:06.556
They're not closed, are they?

23:14.356 --> 23:18.632
Okay, now... deep breaths.

23:19.016 --> 23:21.851
Let your thoughts blow
through your mind, like...

23:22.843 --> 23:25.266
fallen leaves on the wind.

24:09.766 --> 24:11.226
Ma?

24:14.356 --> 24:15.646
Dad?

25:14.016 --> 25:16.327
Hey, do you have any idea
what's going on?

25:16.476 --> 25:18.016
Where is everybody?

25:21.140 --> 25:22.935
- Tyrone, is that you?
- Hey.

25:23.427 --> 25:25.911
Hey. Hey, do you have
any idea what's going on?

25:25.950 --> 25:28.075
So what? You think you can ball now?

25:28.169 --> 25:30.288
Better than you, and I'm half your size.

25:30.341 --> 25:32.146
Let's see what you got.

25:32.185 --> 25:34.397
- What are we spellin'?
- Loser.

25:34.476 --> 25:38.912
A word to the wise. You come at
the king, you best not miss.

25:41.266 --> 25:44.265
All right, maybe you got some skills.

25:44.368 --> 25:46.259
Yo, Billy.

25:46.436 --> 25:48.315
- What up, man?
- Found him.

25:48.571 --> 25:50.471
- Who?
- That asshole that stiffed us.

25:50.516 --> 25:52.735
- Come on, man. Language.
- Sorry.

25:52.816 --> 25:54.996
We found his car and we're
gonna take back our radio.

25:55.044 --> 25:56.254
You comin'?

26:02.856 --> 26:05.760
Nah, man. I'm gonna
stay with my brother.

26:17.516 --> 26:18.646
This is for you.

26:38.734 --> 26:40.484
What the hell is going on?

26:52.329 --> 26:54.999
Tyrone? Tyrone, can you hear me?

27:02.857 --> 27:04.317
What is this?

27:05.827 --> 27:07.139

29:36.986 --> 29:38.229
Watch out for the water!

30:06.690 --> 30:08.560
Who is that?

30:10.650 --> 30:12.150
What is this?

30:18.956 --> 30:20.244
Hey.

Tandy!

30:36.862 --> 30:38.652

30:52.440 --> 30:54.809
Tandy. Where do you think you're goin'?

30:56.503 --> 30:58.745
What do you think is on the other side?

31:00.648 --> 31:01.986

Tandy, why aren't you helping me?

31:14.560 --> 31:17.079
Tandy! Stop!

31:20.262 --> 31:21.762
Please.

31:22.785 --> 31:23.995
Please, stop running.

32:36.463 --> 32:40.633
Hey. Don't cry. It's gonna be okay.

32:41.956 --> 32:45.578

O'Reilly, right?

35:09.025 --> 35:10.179
That's right.

35:11.201 --> 35:13.048
Connors. Vice.

35:13.111 --> 35:14.781
Got a present for you.

35:16.991 --> 35:18.865
You can buy me a beer later.

35:18.955 --> 35:20.529
What's this?

35:22.170 --> 35:24.539
Thought the NYPD only hired
the best and brightest.

35:24.607 --> 35:27.245
This is... How did you get this?

35:27.311 --> 35:30.702
Found on a junkie DOA earlier today.

35:30.771 --> 35:33.504
Someone claims they found this
on a dead drug addict?

35:33.561 --> 35:36.366
Not someone. Me.

35:36.523 --> 35:38.602
Took it off the stiff myself.

35:38.721 --> 35:40.702
During a Vice raid.

35:40.851 --> 35:43.971
Seems your case was just
a mugging gone wrong.

35:44.907 --> 35:47.254
Vic's lawyers corroborated the story.

35:47.381 --> 35:48.723
None of that fits the evidence.

35:48.756 --> 35:50.716
So what? The case is closed.

35:51.931 --> 35:54.410
I'm sorry, did you say
the case is closed?

35:54.471 --> 35:56.471
Check with your LT
if you don't believe me.

35:58.324 --> 35:59.971
And, O'Reilly...

36:01.092 --> 36:04.347
That beer, the one you owe me,

36:05.773 --> 36:08.853
make sure it's none of that
hipster Brooklyn shit, all right?

36:20.063 --> 36:21.812
Detective O'Reilly.

36:21.868 --> 36:24.121
<i>Hi, Detective. It's Tandy Bowen.</i>

36:24.192 --> 36:26.340
<i>My mom gave me your card.</i>

36:28.022 --> 36:30.142
If you're serious about what you said...

36:33.642 --> 36:35.692
I'm willing to stay and face this.

36:41.748 --> 36:45.618
You know I should...
should thank you, for today.

36:45.892 --> 36:47.360
You feel better?

36:48.562 --> 36:49.812
You look better.

36:51.170 --> 36:55.927
Mm, after all that... initial
whatever it was wore off,

36:56.028 --> 36:58.568
yeah... I do.

37:01.562 --> 37:02.812
Did you get your wish?

37:04.392 --> 37:06.411
The answers you were looking for?

37:07.402 --> 37:10.739
Uh... honestly, no.

37:12.232 --> 37:15.772
No, but I... think I know how I can.

37:18.566 --> 37:20.186
What exactly did you see?

37:23.396 --> 37:26.146
I... I don't... I don't think
I should say.

37:27.142 --> 37:29.062
I don't think it was my journey.

37:31.772 --> 37:33.869
Oh, I made a wish too.

37:33.932 --> 37:35.232
At the tomb.

37:36.732 --> 37:38.314
You did?

37:38.392 --> 37:39.852
Couple days ago.

37:57.812 --> 37:59.482
So that's it?

38:01.932 --> 38:03.482
That's it.

38:07.352 --> 38:09.242
For what it's worth...
