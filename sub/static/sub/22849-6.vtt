00:24.291 --> 00:25.958
This isn't funny anymore.

00:29.208 --> 00:30.208
Katharina?

00:32.875 --> 00:33.833
Ulrich?

00:37.250 --> 00:38.625
This isn't funny anymore.

00:55.666 --> 00:56.958
Help!

00:57.750 --> 00:59.041
Help!

01:00.666 --> 01:01.833
Help!

01:23.791 --> 01:24.958
It was just a nightmare.

01:26.916 --> 01:28.541
Tell me everything's all right.

01:33.125 --> 01:34.375
Everything is all right.

03:16.791 --> 03:17.875
One dead boy...

03:17.958 --> 03:18.791
MISSING

03:18.875 --> 03:20.500
...three missing children.

03:20.583 --> 03:23.791
We're widening the search.
I want you to knock on every door.

03:24.416 --> 03:29.291
Start with the residential areas close
to where the children were last seen.

03:29.375 --> 03:32.125
I want you to question everyone. Everyone.

03:32.208 --> 03:34.500
Someone must have seen something.

03:34.583 --> 03:36.916
Coordinate with other departments
in the district.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.416
I also want you to search the archives

03:39.500 --> 03:42.625
for similar cases in and around Winden
over the last 50 years.

03:43.166 --> 03:46.708
Even if a child went missing
for just 24 hours, I want to know.

03:47.666 --> 03:51.583
I want you all working double shifts.
Leave no stone left unturned in this town.

03:51.958 --> 03:54.041
Search every single basement.

03:54.125 --> 03:56.666
Everyone leaves
some kind of trace somewhere.

03:57.333 --> 03:58.750
We just have to find it.

04:00.500 --> 04:02.916
How did you and Dad meet?

04:12.041 --> 04:13.541
In the hospital.

04:15.625 --> 04:17.208
I was 14.

04:18.791 --> 04:20.916
Your father had a broken leg.

04:26.166 --> 04:27.875
And I was in a bad mood.

04:29.083 --> 04:30.666
What was he like?

04:32.041 --> 04:33.208
Earlier.

04:34.583 --> 04:36.125
Before he got sick.

04:38.208 --> 04:39.375
He was...

04:41.541 --> 04:42.708
different.

04:47.708 --> 04:50.958
You never knew
if he meant something seriously or not.

04:57.500 --> 04:58.625
Mom...

05:01.666 --> 05:02.500
Yes?

05:11.166 --> 05:12.458
Nothing.

WINDEN BOY (12) VANISHES

05:34.250 --> 05:35.166
MADS NIELSEN MISSING

05:43.291 --> 05:45.541
When does he normally come home?

05:46.541 --> 05:48.625
He goes to fencing classes on Thursdays.

05:49.333 --> 05:51.125
And he gets home just after six.

05:52.875 --> 05:56.583
When he wasn't home by seven,
I knew something was wrong.

05:57.375 --> 05:59.041
And your husband?

05:59.125 --> 06:00.791
Where was he?

06:00.875 --> 06:02.916
He was home. With us, he...

06:04.125 --> 06:09.375
The three of us were waiting for Mads.
Tronte, Ulrich and I.

06:26.333 --> 06:27.833
Where are you going?

06:28.666 --> 06:29.583
School.

06:32.541 --> 06:34.541
No, you aren't going anywhere.

06:34.625 --> 06:36.333
Is this supposed to go on forever?

06:36.875 --> 06:38.333
Keeping us locked up here?

06:38.416 --> 06:40.041
Locked up?

06:40.791 --> 06:43.416
Your brother
has only been missing four days.

06:43.500 --> 06:46.750
He's not going to come back
just because we're sitting around.

06:46.833 --> 06:49.000
Come back here and talk to me!

06:52.875 --> 06:55.250
I can't let the others down.
They need me.

06:55.625 --> 06:56.833
Who needs you?

06:57.666 --> 06:58.750
The play...

06:59.916 --> 07:01.458
I thought it was cancelled.

07:01.541 --> 07:04.750
No! Mr. Meinel said it'd be better
to give people a break,

07:04.833 --> 07:06.666
so they can think about something else.

07:07.666 --> 07:09.083
Great.

07:09.791 --> 07:12.208
So everyone
is just thinking of themselves.

07:12.291 --> 07:14.083
You're no different!

07:14.166 --> 07:16.625
Did you once think about us
these last few days?

07:16.708 --> 07:18.125
That's enough!

07:18.916 --> 07:21.958
And how many more of these
damned things will you put up?

07:22.083 --> 07:25.333
-She didn't mean it like that.
-Yes, I did! I meant it like that.

07:25.416 --> 07:27.000
This is so fucked up!

07:27.083 --> 07:31.208
Everyone's waiting for Mikkel to come back
through that door, as if nothing happened.

07:31.291 --> 07:33.041
Dad doesn't even dare
come home anymore!

07:33.541 --> 07:36.625
-And no one gives a shit about us.
-That's not true.

07:36.708 --> 07:39.375
But for once,
this isn't about you, Martha.

07:40.583 --> 07:42.041
You're so blind.

07:42.500 --> 07:45.458
Everyone's thinking it,
but no one dares say it.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
Mikkel is dead!

07:59.916 --> 08:01.250
Oh, shit.

FOLLOW THE SIGNAL!

10:26.833 --> 10:27.833
Ulrich.

10:46.166 --> 10:47.958
How are you all holding up?

10:48.666 --> 10:50.375
Katharina, the children?

10:56.000 --> 10:57.458
Where's Mom?

10:57.541 --> 10:58.666
Sleeping.

10:59.458 --> 11:01.000
She's taking pills.

11:04.916 --> 11:06.625
When Mads disappeared back then,

11:06.708 --> 11:08.291
was there ever a suspect?

11:08.375 --> 11:10.333
Did Egon have anything?

11:10.458 --> 11:11.291
Egon?

11:11.625 --> 11:13.375
Egon was an idiot.

11:13.458 --> 11:16.083
He just wanted to retire,
that was all he wanted.

11:17.166 --> 11:19.458
That dead boy we found in the forest...

11:21.708 --> 11:23.583
He was dressed like in the '80s.

11:24.375 --> 11:27.541
Maybe all this has something
to do with what happened back then.

11:27.625 --> 11:29.125
Maybe it's all happening again.

11:29.208 --> 11:30.958
Maybe it's the same perpetrator.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.041
Where were you
the night Mads disappeared?

11:36.375 --> 11:39.083
Mom said you were home.
But I remember, you weren't.

11:39.625 --> 11:41.333
You weren't there for dinner.

11:42.333 --> 11:44.291
You didn't come home
until late that night.

11:49.166 --> 11:51.583
Mom was staring at the clock
the whole time.

11:52.166 --> 11:53.125
Then at some point...

11:54.750 --> 11:56.250
she started to pray.

11:57.416 --> 11:58.666
Very softly.

11:59.458 --> 12:01.208
And you weren't there.

12:01.291 --> 12:02.458
Where were you?

12:07.916 --> 12:10.041
Do you suspect me now?

12:11.333 --> 12:13.416
I've made a lot of mistakes,

12:13.500 --> 12:15.958
but that you could even
think such a thing...

12:18.333 --> 12:22.000
Where were you five days ago,
when Mikkel disappeared?

12:22.083 --> 12:23.375
He was here.

12:24.875 --> 12:27.000
Where else would he have been?

12:54.833 --> 12:57.166
How you two fought over these figures!

12:58.833 --> 13:00.583
It was Christmas.

13:01.583 --> 13:03.083
1985.

13:03.791 --> 13:07.041
You ended up going at each other
like two boxers.

13:08.416 --> 13:11.416
Mads smashed into the glass table
in the living room.

13:11.500 --> 13:14.458
There was so much blood,
like in a horror movie.

13:14.541 --> 13:16.041
But in the end...

13:16.583 --> 13:18.541
it turned out to be just a small cut.

13:19.375 --> 13:21.000
On his chin.

13:21.083 --> 13:23.416
You both laughed yourselves silly.

13:23.500 --> 13:25.125
That's how you were.

13:25.708 --> 13:28.333
One minute you hated each other's guts,

13:28.416 --> 13:30.291
the next minute you were best friends.

13:31.291 --> 13:32.708
Mom, why did you lie?

13:34.083 --> 13:36.166
Dad wasn't home that evening.

13:36.250 --> 13:38.416
You told Egon back then
that Dad was with us.

13:38.500 --> 13:41.125
I listened to the recording.
So why did you lie?

13:48.333 --> 13:50.750
Did you know
that I wanted to leave your father?

13:52.791 --> 13:54.583
Before it all happened.

13:55.291 --> 13:56.875
He was having an affair.

13:58.083 --> 13:59.750
It wasn't the first one.

14:01.000 --> 14:04.041
And the night Mads disappeared...

14:04.916 --> 14:06.500
he was with her.

14:07.666 --> 14:11.375
While your brother disappeared,
he was sleeping with another woman.

14:15.958 --> 14:17.791
Do you know who she was?

14:21.083 --> 14:22.500
Claudia.

14:25.458 --> 14:27.250
Claudia Tiedemann.

14:28.458 --> 14:31.041
Who was the last person
to see Mads that evening?

14:32.750 --> 14:34.416
It was Regina.

14:34.500 --> 14:36.166
Regina Tiedemann.

14:36.250 --> 14:37.833
Claudia's daughter.

15:04.500 --> 15:06.541
You've reached Aleksander Tiedemann.

15:06.625 --> 15:08.875
Please leave a message after the signal.

17:04.291 --> 17:05.125
Hey.

17:05.791 --> 17:06.625
Hey.

17:13.375 --> 17:14.791
How are you?

17:15.500 --> 17:16.500
Good.

17:24.875 --> 17:26.583
You didn't call me back.

17:27.500 --> 17:29.000
I was getting worried.

17:31.041 --> 17:31.875
I...

17:33.500 --> 17:35.208
I'm so sorry about everything.

17:35.875 --> 17:37.458
It's all my fault.

17:38.375 --> 17:41.291
I shouldn't have had
that stupid idea with the caves.

17:45.166 --> 17:46.000
Hey.

17:46.416 --> 17:47.875
Say something.

17:49.666 --> 17:51.375
Are you angry with me?

17:53.541 --> 17:54.625
No.

17:55.333 --> 17:57.000
Why should I be angry?

18:02.666 --> 18:04.666
I can't do this right now.

18:11.458 --> 18:13.000
Do you want to leave?

18:13.541 --> 18:14.666
I'll run away with you.

18:15.833 --> 18:16.750
Honestly.

18:17.375 --> 18:19.083
The play is about to start.

18:26.500 --> 18:28.208
Have you seen Jonas?

18:29.875 --> 18:31.041
Why?

18:31.583 --> 18:34.791
No reason.
The jerk stood me up yesterday.

18:34.875 --> 18:36.666
But... whatever.

18:37.500 --> 18:38.958
I'm sure he'll come later.

18:46.625 --> 18:50.458
NO ENTRY!

RECIPIENT MR. ULRICH NIELSEN

20:40.500 --> 20:41.708
Hello?

20:44.958 --> 20:46.250
Ulrich?

21:38.125 --> 21:39.791
What are you doing here?

21:43.083 --> 21:44.333
1986.

21:45.416 --> 21:47.375
The night my brother went missing.

21:47.833 --> 21:49.041
What really happened?

21:50.208 --> 21:51.833
That was over 30 years ago.

21:51.916 --> 21:53.750
You were the last one
to see him that night.

21:54.083 --> 21:56.250
Did you notice
anything unusual that day?

21:56.333 --> 21:59.291
Did he say something?
Something strange? Anything at all?

22:05.458 --> 22:07.541
Did you know they were having an affair?

22:09.458 --> 22:10.833
Your mother and my father.

22:19.708 --> 22:23.583
Mads was the only person I knew
who never said a bad word about anyone.

22:26.458 --> 22:28.625
I've always asked myself,
why him, of all people?

22:31.541 --> 22:35.333
I always thought it should have
happened to you instead of him.

22:36.041 --> 22:37.958
But there's no justice in this world.

22:38.416 --> 22:40.291
And the absurd thing is...

22:40.375 --> 22:44.541
had it not been for you and Katharina,
maybe Mads wouldn't have disappeared.

22:44.625 --> 22:48.416
Mads knew I was afraid to walk home alone
because of you two.

22:48.500 --> 22:50.500
Because of what you did to me.

22:51.333 --> 22:54.666
Otherwise, he wouldn't have gone with me
and returned through the forest.

22:55.500 --> 22:58.458
And the whole thing
would have never happened.

22:58.541 --> 23:00.666
What happened in the forest back then...

23:01.125 --> 23:04.166
It was a game. We were children.
We all made mistakes back then.

23:04.250 --> 23:06.375
And still you never apologized for it.

23:06.500 --> 23:08.625
So this is about an apology for you?

23:08.708 --> 23:12.250
So that's how you see yourself.
A victim. Poor, innocent Regina.

23:12.666 --> 23:14.750
You're so fake it makes me sick!

23:15.375 --> 23:19.458
You told your drunken, good-for-nothing
grandpa that I raped Katharina.

23:22.166 --> 23:24.125
That's what you thought?

23:30.916 --> 23:32.708
Hannah saw you back then.

23:33.750 --> 23:34.875
At the police station.

23:35.791 --> 23:36.791
Hannah?

23:37.416 --> 23:40.041
The same Hannah
who at 14 was so in love with you

23:40.125 --> 23:42.458
that she would have done anything
to have you?

23:43.833 --> 23:45.875
But I guess
that hasn't really changed.

23:47.916 --> 23:51.041
So that's what you thought
all these years? That I spread that story?

23:53.291 --> 23:54.958
Why would I do something like that?

23:56.666 --> 23:58.958
I'm not half as bad as you are.

24:12.833 --> 24:16.458
MISSING

24:18.250 --> 24:22.666
Winden police confirmed yesterday
that the body of a child has been found.

24:22.750 --> 24:26.333
It is not the body of one
of the three children currently missing.

24:26.791 --> 24:30.083
Have the police failed us?
Are our children safe?

24:30.166 --> 24:32.625
We'd like to hear from you about this.

24:32.708 --> 24:37.416

I'm the mother of Mikkel Nielsen,
one of the children...

24:49.500 --> 24:50.625
That's right.

24:52.208 --> 24:53.500
Okay, I'll wait.

24:56.166 --> 24:58.416
We have someone on the line now.

24:58.500 --> 25:02.000
Mrs. Nielsen, mother
of one of Winden's missing children.

25:02.083 --> 25:06.291
She'd like to talk with us about
the tragic events of the last few days.

25:06.375 --> 25:07.333
Mrs. Nielsen?

25:07.416 --> 25:10.500
I want people to finally understand
what's really going on here.

25:11.875 --> 25:13.458
We're all so blind.

25:15.458 --> 25:17.166
There's a murderer among us.

25:19.375 --> 25:21.291
No one actually dares to say it.

25:22.375 --> 25:23.875
But it's the truth.

25:25.750 --> 25:28.833
We cling to the hope
that it won't happen here.

25:30.708 --> 25:32.083
We all know one another.

And behind one of those doors...

25:52.125 --> 25:53.333
is my son.

25:55.458 --> 25:57.500
It could be anyone's door.

25:57.625 --> 25:59.750
The man behind the cash register.

25:59.833 --> 26:04.125
Someone we invited for cake on a Sunday,
who plays with our children.

26:09.333 --> 26:11.125
I don't want to look away anymore.

26:11.208 --> 26:13.500
And you shouldn't either.

26:14.375 --> 26:16.208
This city is sick.

26:17.541 --> 26:19.416
Winden is like a festering wound.

26:19.500 --> 26:21.416
And we're all part of it.

26:36.375 --> 26:37.916
Mammography Center.

26:38.041 --> 26:39.916
Hello. Tiedemann speaking.

26:40.041 --> 26:44.250
My wife had a cancer examination
at your center on October 27th.

26:44.875 --> 26:47.208
We still don't have the results.

26:47.291 --> 26:48.750
What was her name again?

26:48.833 --> 26:50.791
Tiedemann. Regina Tiedemann.

26:52.541 --> 26:56.250
That's odd. The results were sent out
the day before yesterday.

26:56.333 --> 27:00.333
We detected invasive carcinomas
a few weeks ago.

27:00.416 --> 27:03.208
The latest results
show that they have metastasized.

27:03.291 --> 27:07.291
Your wife should make an appointment
to see Dr. Urman as soon as possible.

27:08.041 --> 27:09.208
Hello?

27:10.208 --> 27:11.500
Mr. Tiedemann?

28:17.208 --> 28:18.041
Ulrich!

28:19.166 --> 28:22.416
-What are you doing here, I thought...
-What do you want from me?

28:23.333 --> 28:25.500
-What?
-What do you want from me?

28:30.375 --> 28:31.958
It was you in 1986.

28:32.541 --> 28:35.166
You gave a statement against me
in the rape case.

28:37.500 --> 28:38.916
How sick are you?

28:40.291 --> 28:41.833
You're hurting me!

28:42.875 --> 28:44.500
Are you trying to ruin me?

28:45.625 --> 28:48.500
Do you want to destroy my family?
Is that what you want?

28:50.833 --> 28:52.250
What do you want?

28:54.583 --> 28:55.416
You.

29:04.416 --> 29:06.208
You know what? You're poison.

29:06.291 --> 29:09.416
You snuggle up close, like you're honey.
But it's just poison.

29:11.291 --> 29:13.583
How did your husband
put up with you for so long?

29:13.666 --> 29:16.250
No wonder
he couldn't take it anymore, in the end.

29:26.125 --> 29:27.708
I thought I knew you.

29:30.375 --> 29:32.666
How easily one can be deceived by people.

29:41.625 --> 29:45.458
Now you have heard her,
the daughter of Minos.

29:46.833 --> 29:48.250
You think you know her.

29:48.333 --> 29:51.458
Is she not beautiful and good?

29:52.375 --> 29:54.666
You have let yourself be enchanted.

29:55.333 --> 29:56.875
By her words.

29:57.000 --> 29:58.583
By her pretty gaze.

29:59.750 --> 30:01.375
But believe me.

30:01.458 --> 30:04.500
Everyone,
whether the daughter of a king or not,

30:04.583 --> 30:06.875
has one foot in the shadow

30:08.041 --> 30:09.791
and only the other in the light.

30:27.791 --> 30:29.750
Only 19 minutes to go till 9:17.

30:38.708 --> 30:40.208
What is it?

30:42.458 --> 30:44.041
When are you coming home?

30:46.000 --> 30:48.500
Soon.
I'm just picking up Bartosz from school.

30:48.583 --> 30:50.833
He insisted on going to this play.

30:56.583 --> 30:58.541
I'm here for you. You know that.

31:00.166 --> 31:01.791
No matter what.

31:05.875 --> 31:07.458
Don't be late.

31:09.833 --> 31:10.666
Okay.

31:13.041 --> 31:14.208
Regina...

31:15.708 --> 31:17.208
I love you.

31:20.916 --> 31:22.416
I love you too.

31:25.458 --> 31:26.291
Take this.

31:27.375 --> 31:29.125
It will guide you.

31:29.208 --> 31:34.000
You have to go deep inside, to the center.
He is waiting there in the shadows.

31:34.833 --> 31:37.500
Half human, half beast.

31:39.458 --> 31:42.125
You must be quick.
Aim straight for the heart.

31:43.625 --> 31:45.500
But is he not your brother?

31:46.916 --> 31:48.500
It is all the same to me.

31:51.208 --> 31:52.875
This bond we tie now,

31:52.958 --> 31:55.125
promise me you will never sever it.

31:56.500 --> 31:57.625
I promise.

32:21.791 --> 32:25.541
FOLLOW THE SIGNAL!

33:28.666 --> 33:30.708
Nothing but darkness surrounds me.

33:32.416 --> 33:34.250
Eternally lurking shadows.

33:36.541 --> 33:38.333
I have not eaten in days.

33:39.791 --> 33:41.375
My eyes are turning black.

33:42.625 --> 33:43.833
The end is nearing.

33:48.666 --> 33:51.041
Just as he once descended into the maze,

33:53.500 --> 33:55.208
I now descend into mine.

34:36.500 --> 34:37.750
Now I stand before you.

34:39.583 --> 34:41.083
No king's daughter.

34:44.000 --> 34:45.333
No man's wife.

34:48.416 --> 34:49.833
No brother's sister.

34:55.333 --> 34:57.583
A loose end in time.

35:06.541 --> 35:08.375
And so we all die alike.

35:11.625 --> 35:13.458
No matter into which house we are born.

35:15.291 --> 35:16.625
No matter which gown.

35:20.666 --> 35:22.041
Whether we grace the earth briefly

35:24.416 --> 35:25.583
or for a long time.

35:29.583 --> 35:31.416
I alone tie my bonds.

35:33.458 --> 35:35.083
Whether I have extended hands

35:37.791 --> 35:39.041
or slapped them.

35:41.750 --> 35:43.500
We all face the same end.

35:46.166 --> 35:48.083
Those above have long forgotten us.

35:52.000 --> 35:53.708
They do not judge us.

36:00.000 --> 36:01.916
In death, I am all alone.

36:05.833 --> 36:07.500
And my only judge...

36:09.875 --> 36:10.708
is me.

36:36.083 --> 36:38.541
Everything's okay. I'm here.

37:17.375 --> 37:19.250
WINDEN MIDDLE SCHOOL
THROUGH THE YEARS

37:19.333 --> 37:21.416
CLASS 6B 1987

38:06.125 --> 38:08.958
9:17 PM

38:21.000 --> 38:22.333
You did great tonight.

38:25.208 --> 38:27.083
Is the play over?

38:27.708 --> 38:29.708
Or did you drag your daughter off stage

38:29.791 --> 38:32.708
to save her
from the sick people in this town?

38:33.625 --> 38:35.750
If you can't stand living here...

38:36.416 --> 38:38.416
why don't you just leave?

40:23.125 --> 40:24.125
Did you see that?

40:24.875 --> 40:26.791
That is who your mother really is.

40:28.666 --> 40:30.250
You and Ulrich,

40:30.666 --> 40:32.500
you truly deserve each other.

40:33.583 --> 40:34.833
Let me go.

40:35.208 --> 40:37.291
Tell them what happened back then!

40:39.333 --> 40:41.458
Tell them who their mother really is.

40:48.333 --> 40:49.208
Let's go.

43:52.875 --> 43:54.625
I can't sleep.

43:56.125 --> 43:57.291
Go away.

44:00.083 --> 44:01.416
Can we talk?

44:06.166 --> 44:07.000
Yes.

44:26.333 --> 44:29.291
What the fuck was all that back at school?

44:32.125 --> 44:33.625
No idea.

44:42.333 --> 44:44.916
Do you think
things will ever be the same again?

44:53.625 --> 44:55.375
You know what I find weird?

44:58.500 --> 45:01.041
You don't actually know your parents,
do you?

45:02.875 --> 45:06.875
What they were like as kids or teenagers.

45:11.750 --> 45:15.125
You're a family, but you don't really know
anything about each other.

45:21.083 --> 45:22.750
Can I sleep here tonight?

45:26.416 --> 45:29.375
Okay, but keep
those cold feet of yours on your side.

45:57.750 --> 46:00.250
MISSING

46:11.916 --> 46:13.625
Can we give you a lift?

46:13.708 --> 46:15.708
A bit late to be walking around alone.

46:17.416 --> 46:19.750
You shouldn't stay out
in the rain so long.

46:21.333 --> 46:22.541
Why not?

46:22.625 --> 46:24.458
Because it's acid.

46:25.375 --> 46:26.416
Chernobyl.

46:26.833 --> 46:30.000
People say it's not in the rain anymore,
but I don't believe it.

46:30.083 --> 46:32.916
Hannah, move over. Come on, hop in.
I'll drive you home.

46:33.416 --> 46:34.250
Hannah?

46:43.375 --> 46:45.041
Thanks, I'm okay.

46:46.750 --> 46:48.125
Close the door.

46:49.333 --> 46:51.291
-What was up with him?
-Forget it.

46:52.458 --> 46:57.333
MISSING

47:28.916 --> 47:32.041
Mads crashed into the glass table
in the living room.

47:32.666 --> 47:35.208
There was so much blood,
like in a horror movie.

47:35.875 --> 47:38.416
But in the end,
it turned out to be just a small cut.

47:39.500 --> 47:40.625
On his chin.

47:42.166 --> 47:43.583
That's how you were.

47:44.041 --> 47:46.333
One minute you hated each other's guts.

47:46.416 --> 47:48.416
The next minute you were best friends.

50:34.166 --> 50:38.166
