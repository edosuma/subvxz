WEBVTT

00:00.701 --> 00:02.403
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.403 --> 00:05.476
I LOVE THIS JOB.
 TOM'S CAREER TOOK OFF.

00:05.476 --> 00:08.179
AND YOU GAVE ME THE CONFIDENCE
TO JUMP AT IT.

00:08.179 --> 00:11.382
I COULD KILL YOU RIGHT NOW,
OR I COULD DO THIS.

00:11.382 --> 00:14.185
FELICIA MADE PEACE WITH PAUL...

00:14.185 --> 00:16.187
AND DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT PAUL.

00:16.187 --> 00:17.488
OR SO HE THOUGHT.

00:17.488 --> 00:19.520
I'LL MAKE HIM PAY
FOR WHAT HE DID TO YOU.

00:19.520 --> 00:22.153
LOOK, I'M YOUR LANDLORD.
I HAVE A RIGHT TO COME IN.

00:22.153 --> 00:24.625
BUT IT WAS SUSAN
WHO GAVE HIM HOPE.

00:24.625 --> 00:27.428
I REMEMBER A GUY THAT USED
TO LIVE ON THIS STREET.

00:27.428 --> 00:30.661
HE HAD A LAUGH YOU COULD HEAR
THREE HOUSES AWAY.
 I'M NOT THAT MAN ANYMORE.

00:30.661 --> 00:33.264
I THINK YOU CAN BE.

00:33.264 --> 00:36.607
WHO DO YOU WANT IN YOUR LIFE--
ME OR BREE? CHOOSE.

00:36.607 --> 00:39.270
AND GABY MADE A DECISION.

00:39.270 --> 00:41.472
CAN I STAY WITH YOU
FOR A WHILE?
 OF COURSE.

00:41.472 --> 00:45.446
GIRLS, COME ON. GO ON IN.

00:45.446 --> 00:47.178
(sighs)

00:53.084 --> 00:56.227
(Mary Alice) BREE VAN DE KAMP
HAD OCCASIONALLY FOUND HER HOME

00:56.227 --> 00:59.230
INVADED BY HOUSEHOLD PESTS.

00:59.230 --> 01:03.394
AND HER MANNER OF DEALING
WITH THEM WAS RUTHLESS.

01:03.394 --> 01:06.066
SHE SMASHED THEM.

01:06.066 --> 01:08.569
SHE POISONED THEM.
 (hisses)

01:08.569 --> 01:11.071
SHE EXECUTED THEM.

01:11.071 --> 01:12.443
(gun cocks, fires)

01:12.443 --> 01:16.147
BUT WHEN IT CAME
TO THE LATEST PESTS

01:16.147 --> 01:17.848
WHO HAD INVADED BREE'S HOME...

01:20.080 --> 01:23.514
EXTERMINATION
WAS NOT AN OPTION.

01:23.514 --> 01:27.358
GIRLS! THERE'S MUD ON
YOUR SHOES! MUD ON YOUR SHOES!

01:27.358 --> 01:29.360
GIRLS! WE ARE GUESTS HERE!

01:29.360 --> 01:31.792
WHAT HAVE I SAID
ABOUT WIPING YOUR FEET?
 (sighs)

01:31.792 --> 01:34.365
SORRY.

01:34.365 --> 01:36.096
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!
NO, NO, NO!

01:36.096 --> 01:40.831
JUST--UH, UH, NEVER MIND.

01:40.831 --> 01:43.804
IT HASN'T RAINED IN THREE WEEKS.
WHERE DID THEY FIND MUD?

01:43.804 --> 01:46.377
HONEY, THEY DON'T FIND MUD.
MUD FINDS THEM.

01:46.377 --> 01:50.711
SO, UM, SPEAKING OF
THE FUN WE'VE BEEN HAVING,

01:50.711 --> 01:53.714
HOW LONG DO YOU THINK IT'LL BE
BEFORE YOU AND CARLOS MAKE UP

01:53.714 --> 01:55.716
AND YOU CAN ALL...
GO BACK HOME?

01:55.716 --> 01:58.789
EH, A FEW DAYS. HE'LL BE
SITTING ALONE IN THAT HOUSE,

01:58.789 --> 02:02.153
REALIZING HOW BIG IT IS,
HOW QUIET IT IS...

02:02.153 --> 02:05.626
HOW CLEAN IT IS.
 THEN HE'LL SHOW UP HERE WITH
THAT HANGDOG LOOK ON HIS FACE,

02:05.626 --> 02:07.127
BEGGING US TO COME BACK.

02:07.127 --> 02:10.231
(Juanita)
OW! MOM! CELIA HIT ME!

02:10.231 --> 02:13.304
THEN HIT HER BACK!
 GABY, DON'T TELL HER
TO DO THAT.

02:13.304 --> 02:15.536
I'D RATHER THEY SETTLE IT.
OTHERWISE,

02:15.536 --> 02:19.170
I HAVE TO GO IN THERE.
 THAT'S WHAT A MOTHER DOES.
COME ON.

02:19.170 --> 02:20.911
GIRLS, IF YOU STOP FIGHTING,

02:20.911 --> 02:24.144
THEN I'LL LET YOU HAVE
SOME FRESH BAKED... COOKIES?!

02:24.144 --> 02:26.447
(stammers)

02:26.447 --> 02:29.280
THERE WERE TWO DOZEN COOKIES
ON THAT PLATE.

02:29.280 --> 02:31.282
YEAH, YOU CAN'T LEAVE
FOOD OUT.

02:31.282 --> 02:33.824
THEY'RE LIKE BEARS.
YOU GOTTA TIE IT UP IN A TREE.

02:33.824 --> 02:36.857
UH, GABY, WHILE YOU'RE HERE,
THIS MIGHT BE A GOOD TIME

02:36.857 --> 02:38.859
TO TEACH THEM
A LITTLE... DISCIPLINE.

02:38.859 --> 02:40.861
DISCIPLINE?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

02:40.861 --> 02:43.894
IT'S NOT LIKE
THE PLATE'S BROKEN.
 (loud shatter)

02:43.894 --> 02:45.636
OH, BOY.

02:45.636 --> 02:50.471
YES, BREE VAN DE KAMP
HAD FINALLY MET TWO PESTS

02:50.471 --> 02:54.174
SHE COULDN'T
SMASH, POISON, OR SHOOT.

02:54.174 --> 02:56.176
OKAY, I'M GONNA NEED
A GARBAGE BAG.

02:56.176 --> 02:59.650
UNLESS IT WAS AN ANTIQUE.
THEN I NEED GLUE.

02:59.650 --> 03:16.797
THAT'S NOT TO SAY
SHE WASN'T SORELY TEMPTED.

03:16.797 --> 03:22.403
GOOD DEEDS AREN'T ALWAYS DONE
FOR THE PUREST OF REASONS.

03:22.403 --> 03:25.276
WE MAY BE TRYING TO IMPRESS.

03:25.276 --> 03:32.243
WE MAY BE ACTING OUT OF GUILT.

03:32.243 --> 03:37.888
WE MAY BE EXPECTING
SOMETHING IN RETURN.

03:37.888 --> 03:40.321
BUT OCCASIONALLY,

03:40.321 --> 03:44.224
A GOOD DEED
COMES STRAIGHT FROM THE HEART.

03:44.224 --> 03:45.956
WOW. WHAT'S THIS?

03:45.956 --> 03:48.629
YOUR LUNCH.
I GOT HAM, HAM AND CHEESE,

03:48.629 --> 03:50.961
AND THAT ONE'S HAM AND GRAVEL.
I DROPPED IT.

03:50.961 --> 03:52.963
SUSAN, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO KEEP DOING THIS.

03:52.963 --> 03:55.466
I WANT TO.
YOU'RE MY NEW PROJECT, MISTER.

03:55.466 --> 03:56.967
YOUR PROJECT?

03:56.967 --> 03:59.510
YES. PAUL YOUNG, PHASE TWO--

03:59.510 --> 04:02.673
WHERE WE FIGURE OUT WHAT
YOU ARE DOING WITH YOUR LIFE,

04:02.673 --> 04:05.776
SET SOME NEW GOALS.

04:05.776 --> 04:08.819
NOW... YOU TRIED DESTROYING
THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

04:08.819 --> 04:10.821
THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT.
WHAT'S NEXT?

04:10.821 --> 04:12.823
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I WANNA DO.

04:12.823 --> 04:15.025
I'VE MADE SUCH A MESS
OF EVERYTHING SO FAR.

04:15.025 --> 04:19.660
NO, NO. PHASE TWO IS ABOUT
THE FUTURE, NOT THE PAST.

04:19.660 --> 04:23.263
SO FROM NOW ON,
WE ARE ONLY LOOKING FORWARD.

04:23.263 --> 04:25.736
OH, MY GOD!
LOOK BEHIND YOU!

04:25.736 --> 04:27.398
HELLO, SUSAN.

04:27.398 --> 04:30.040
OH. HEY, FELICIA.

04:30.040 --> 04:32.042
"HEY, FELICIA"?!

04:32.042 --> 04:34.044
YOU KNEW SHE WAS
IN YOUR HOUSE?

04:34.044 --> 04:36.847
I-I THOUGHT YOU WERE
IN PRISON.

04:36.847 --> 04:39.850
OH, I'VE BEEN OUT FOR WEEKS.
WHAT NICE SANDWICHES.
 MM.

04:39.850 --> 04:42.383
ARE YOU COOKING FOR PAUL NOW?

04:42.383 --> 04:45.285
YEAH, FOR PAUL...

04:45.285 --> 04:48.719
THE GUY THAT YOU CUT OFF
YOUR FINGERS TO FRAME.

04:48.719 --> 04:50.020
IT'S ALL RIGHT, SUSAN.

04:50.020 --> 04:53.023
FELICIA AND I
HAVE REACHED AN UNDERSTANDING.

04:53.023 --> 04:54.995
(chuckles) WE CAN HARDLY
KEEP SQUABBLING,

04:54.995 --> 04:57.297
NOW THAT WE'RE GOING
TO BE NEIGHBORS AGAIN.

04:57.297 --> 05:00.371
WAIT. YOU'RE LIVING HERE?

05:00.371 --> 05:01.872
RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET.

05:01.872 --> 05:04.875
I JUST CAME BY TO PICK UP
SOME OF BETH'S THINGS.

05:04.875 --> 05:09.079
ALTHOUGH I THINK YOU SHOULD KEEP
THAT PRETTY OIL PAINTING

05:09.079 --> 05:11.081
SHE MADE FOR YOU.
 MM.

05:11.081 --> 05:12.913
HANG ON.
YOU--YOU KNEW BETH?

05:12.913 --> 05:14.915
YOU DIDN'T TELL HER.

05:14.915 --> 05:17.388
THE TOPIC DOESN'T EXACTLY
INTRODUCE ITSELF.

05:19.019 --> 05:22.553
BETH WAS FELICIA'S DAUGHTER.

05:24.655 --> 05:25.956
WHAT?

05:28.729 --> 05:31.362
SO YOU'RE BETH'S...

05:31.362 --> 05:34.104
AND YOU KNEW...

05:34.104 --> 05:37.408
AND YOU'RE LIVING...

05:37.408 --> 05:39.810
I NEED TO SIT DOWN.

05:47.077 --> 05:50.781
WE'RE GONNA GET
A LOT OF THIS.

05:53.053 --> 05:56.957
SO FELICIA TILLMAN
WAS BETH'S MOTHER?

05:56.957 --> 05:58.959
"SNIP-SNIP" TILLMAN?
YOU SURE?

05:58.959 --> 06:01.962
YEP.
 AND PEOPLE SAY
THE SUBURBS ARE BORING?

06:01.962 --> 06:06.036
GREAT. NOW WE'VE GOT ANOTHER
NUT JOB LIVING ON THE STREET.
 ACTUALLY...

06:06.036 --> 06:08.999
PAUL IS NOT SO BAD.
 YEAH, WHAT WERE YOU DOING
OVER THERE?

06:08.999 --> 06:11.442
BRINGING HIM FOOD.
UH, CHECKING UP ON HIM.

06:11.442 --> 06:13.043
MAKING SURE HE'S OKAY.

06:13.043 --> 06:14.144
WHY?

06:14.144 --> 06:16.707
'CAUSE I FEEL BAD FOR HIM.

06:16.707 --> 06:19.650
THE POOR GUY HAS HAD TWO WIVES
KILL THEMSELVES.

06:19.650 --> 06:23.083
AND HERE I WAS CONCENTRATING
ALL MY PITY ON THE DEAD PEOPLE.

06:23.083 --> 06:24.515
(Renee) SUSAN, BE CAREFUL.

06:24.515 --> 06:27.017
YEAH, WE UNDERSTAND
BETH GAVE YOU A KIDNEY,

06:27.017 --> 06:28.659
BUT YOU DON'T OWE
PAUL ANYTHING.

06:28.659 --> 06:30.621
I KNOW I DON'T.

06:30.621 --> 06:32.963
BUT THAT KIDNEY GAVE ME
A SECOND CHANCE IN LIFE,

06:32.963 --> 06:37.768
AND I'M SORRY. I FEEL THAT
PAUL DESERVES THE SAME THING.

06:40.701 --> 06:44.775
TO US, OUR DECORATING FIRM,
AND OUR LATEST TRIUMPH,

06:44.775 --> 06:46.036
THE DELANEY BATHROOM.

06:46.036 --> 06:48.038
TODAY, SUBWAY TILE
AND A LOW-FLOW TOILET.

06:48.038 --> 06:50.841
TOMORROW, NOT WALKING IN
ON MR. DELANEY

06:50.841 --> 06:52.713
ON THE LOW-FLOW TOILET.

06:52.713 --> 06:53.984
(inhales sharply)

06:53.984 --> 06:56.046
(cork pops, clatter)

06:56.046 --> 06:59.049
YOU BOUGHT THIS
AT A DRUGSTORE, DIDN'T YOU?

06:59.049 --> 07:02.022
COME ON. "DAN PERRIGNON."
IT'S CUTE.

07:02.022 --> 07:04.124
A LITTLE TIP--
WHEN PICKING CHAMPAGNE,

07:04.124 --> 07:06.997
WORDPLAY USUALLY ISN'T
A SELLING POINT.

07:08.499 --> 07:10.801
HEY. YOU'RE HOME EARLY.

07:10.801 --> 07:12.603
NO, JUST FORGOT SOME FILES.

07:12.603 --> 07:14.635
HEADED STRAIGHT BACK
TO THE OFFICE.

07:14.635 --> 07:18.739
OOH! DAN PERRIGNON!
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS CELEBRATING?

07:18.739 --> 07:21.041
RENEE AND I FINISHED
A DESIGN JOB TODAY.

07:21.041 --> 07:24.444
YEAH.
WE ACTUALLY CLEARED $293.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.446
WELL,
$290 AFTER THIS CHAMPAGNE.

07:26.446 --> 07:28.448
HEY, WE'RE A SMALL COMPANY.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.751
WHY IS THE GLASS
ALWAYS HALF EMPTY WITH YOU?

07:30.751 --> 07:33.724
HEY, I DON'T KNOW WHY I DIDN'T
THINK OF THIS SOONER.

07:33.724 --> 07:35.726
I JUST GOT MY BUDGET.

07:35.726 --> 07:38.058
THERE'S SOME MONEY IN THERE
TO REDECORATE MY OFFICE.

07:38.058 --> 07:40.060
HOW ABOUT YOU GUYS DO IT?

07:40.060 --> 07:42.462
UH, WELL,
WE'RE A LITTLE BUSY.

07:42.462 --> 07:43.594
IT'S 20 GRAND.

07:43.594 --> 07:45.636
BUSY THANKING YOU.

07:45.636 --> 07:47.638
YOU'D LET US DO THAT?
YOU'RE AMAZING!

07:47.638 --> 07:49.640
THAT WOULD BE HUGE
FOR OUR COMPANY. MWAH.

07:49.640 --> 07:52.643
LOOK, I KNOW THIS NEW JOB'S
PUT A BIT OF A STRAIN ON US.

07:52.643 --> 07:54.645
THIS MIGHT BE A GOOD WAY
TO SNEAK IN

07:54.645 --> 07:57.477
A LITTLE EXTRA TIME TOGETHER.

07:57.477 --> 08:01.552
SO YOU THINK YOU CAN DO
SOMETHING FOR 20 GRAND?
 THIS MAY BE
THE DOG SHAMPOO TALKING,

08:01.552 --> 08:04.054
BUT FOR 20 GRAND, WE WILL
DECORATE YOUR OFFICE...

08:04.054 --> 08:06.056
AND WHACK AN EMPLOYEE
OF YOUR CHOOSING.

08:06.056 --> 08:07.518
(laughs)

08:07.518 --> 08:08.959
(clink)

08:11.061 --> 08:14.124
HEY, ROOMIE!

08:14.124 --> 08:16.727
HELLO... ROOMIE.

08:16.727 --> 08:18.829
THOSE ARE BEAUTIFUL.

08:18.829 --> 08:21.031
THEY'RE FOR YOU
FROM THE GIRLS.

08:21.031 --> 08:23.073
THEY FELT TERRIBLE
ABOUT BREAKING YOUR MIRROR.

08:23.073 --> 08:24.735
OH. YOU MEAN
MY SERVING DISH.

08:24.735 --> 08:27.107
OH, YOU HAVEN'T BEEN
UPSTAIRS YET.

08:27.107 --> 08:29.079
(whispers) GABY!

08:29.079 --> 08:30.981
BUT LOOK HOW BEAUTIFUL.

08:30.981 --> 08:33.183
(normal voice)
I'M GOING TO CHURCH.

08:33.183 --> 08:35.015
WEREN'T YOU JUST THERE?

08:35.015 --> 08:39.690
I NEED TO DO SOME MORE PRAYING.
APPARENTLY, IT'S NOT WORKING.

08:39.690 --> 08:42.152
(door opens and closes)

08:42.152 --> 08:44.795
(sighs)

08:48.528 --> 08:49.800
(sighs)

08:50.861 --> 08:52.232
(sighs)

08:52.232 --> 08:54.004
(exhales deeply)

08:56.306 --> 08:58.969
(bicycle clatters)

09:00.771 --> 09:03.313
(sighs)

09:12.082 --> 09:17.688
(horn honking)

09:17.688 --> 09:20.931
IF YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR THE OWNER, THAT'S ME.

09:22.092 --> 09:24.564
ARE YOU AWARE THAT
YOU'RE BLOCKING MY DRIVEWAY?

09:24.564 --> 09:27.097
YEAH. ARE YOU AWARE THAT YOU
ILLEGALLY ENTERED MY VEHICLE?

09:27.097 --> 09:29.900
WELL, I NEEDED
TO GET YOUR ATTENTION.
 DOESN'T MAKE IT LEGAL.

09:29.900 --> 09:31.902
OH, DON'T TRY
TO MAKE THIS MY FAULT.

09:31.902 --> 09:34.775
BLOCKING MY DRIVEWAY
IS ILLEGAL.
 YES, BUT BREAKING INTO MY CAR
IS CRIMINAL.

09:34.775 --> 09:36.076
REALLY? LET'S CALL 9-1-1.

09:36.076 --> 09:38.578
I'D LOVE TO GET
A POLICEMAN'S OPINION ON THAT.

09:38.578 --> 09:40.781
YOU JUST DID.

09:40.781 --> 09:43.654
OH, MY.
YOU ARE A POLICEMAN.

09:43.654 --> 09:45.956
DETECTIVE CHUCK VANCE,
FAIRVIEW P.D.

09:45.956 --> 09:48.158
YOUR NEIGHBOR MRS. TILLMAN'S
A PAROLEE.

09:48.158 --> 09:50.661
I WAS PAYING A ROUTINE CALL.
BUT NOW IT APPEARS

09:50.661 --> 09:53.293
THAT SHE'S NOT THE ONLY
DANGEROUS WOMAN ON THE STREET.

09:53.293 --> 09:56.126
LOOK, I-I DON'T KNOW WHAT LAWS
I MAY HAVE BROKEN, BUT--

09:56.126 --> 09:59.029
UNLAWFUL TRESPASS,
TAMPERING WITH A POLICE VEHICLE,

09:59.029 --> 10:00.801
MALICIOUS MISCHIEF...

10:00.801 --> 10:03.333
OKAY, OKAY. I'M SORRY.
I'M JUST SO FRAZZLED TODAY.

10:03.333 --> 10:05.706
A FRIEND OF MINE
IS STAYING WITH ME,

10:05.706 --> 10:07.708
AND HER TWO GIRLS
ARE ABSOLUTE MONSTERS.

10:07.708 --> 10:10.681
IN FACT, I DON'T SUPPOSE
I COULD BORROW YOUR GUN?

10:10.681 --> 10:12.843
TO SHOOT THE CHILDREN?

10:12.843 --> 10:15.115
I WAS JOKING.

10:15.115 --> 10:16.616
SO WAS I.

10:16.616 --> 10:19.850
I'M SORRY
I BLOCKED YOUR CAR.

10:19.850 --> 10:22.192
UH, WELL, UM...

10:22.192 --> 10:25.125
I-I'M SORRY THAT, UM,
I GOT INTO YOURS.

10:25.125 --> 10:27.127
I'LL TELL THAT
TO THE JUDGE.

10:27.127 --> 10:30.100
I'M SURE YOU'LL GET OFF
WITH COMMUNITY SERVICE.

10:30.100 --> 10:31.802
WAIT.

10:31.802 --> 10:33.103
(door closes)

10:33.103 --> 10:34.334
(engine starts)
 WHAT?

10:34.334 --> 10:36.807
STILL JOKING.

10:53.153 --> 10:55.055
(Juanita) I'M GONNA GET YOU!
YOU COME BACK HERE!
 (Celia) NO! NO! NO!

10:55.055 --> 10:57.027
(sighs)
 (girls yelling indistinctly)

10:57.027 --> 10:59.830
GABY?

10:59.830 --> 11:02.192
OH. RIGHT.
GIRLS! NO RUNNING!

11:02.192 --> 11:04.865
IS THAT ALL YOU'RE GONNA DO?

11:04.865 --> 11:07.197
OF COURSE NOT. NEXT TIME
I'LL TRIP ONE OF THEM.

11:07.197 --> 11:10.070
OR PERHAPS YOU COULD TRY
TAKING A FIRMER HAND.

11:10.070 --> 11:12.773
OH, PLEASE.
I'VE TRIED EVERYTHING.

11:12.773 --> 11:15.776
I EVEN BOUGHT THEM A PUPPY JUST
SO I COULD THREATEN TO KILL IT.

11:15.776 --> 11:17.377
THEY ASKED
IF THEY COULD WATCH.

11:17.377 --> 11:19.379
WELL,
I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.

11:19.379 --> 11:21.381
WOULD YOU MIND
IF I TALKED TO THEM?

11:21.381 --> 11:24.114
PERHAPS HEARING IT
FROM SOMEBODY ELSE

11:24.114 --> 11:25.685
WOULD MAKE THE DIFFERENCE.

11:25.685 --> 11:27.687
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING, BREE?

11:27.687 --> 11:30.090
YOU THINK YOU'RE
A BETTER MOTHER THAN ME?

11:30.090 --> 11:33.123
WELL, NOT TO CAST ASPERSIONS
ON TRIPPING AND KILLING PUPPIES,

11:33.123 --> 11:34.224
BUT THERE ARE
 OTHER APPROACHES.

11:34.224 --> 11:37.127
OKAY, MOTHER SUPERIOR.

11:37.127 --> 11:41.171
YOU THINK YOU CAN GET THOSE
GIRLS TO BEHAVE? BE MY GUEST.

11:45.135 --> 11:47.237
OH, AND IF THE LITTLE ONE
CHARGES, MOVE.

11:47.237 --> 11:49.239
IT'S LIKE SOMEONE DROPPING
A SACK OF FLOUR

11:49.239 --> 11:51.411
OFF THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING.

11:51.411 --> 11:53.944
(screams)
 GIRLS, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

11:53.944 --> 11:57.948
NOT NOW.
WE'RE PLAYING DEATH MATCH.
 WE DO NOT FIGHT IN THIS HOUSE

11:57.948 --> 11:59.419
WITH PILLOWS
MADE OF HAND-DYED SILK.

11:59.419 --> 12:03.053
NOW I AM GONNA
COUNT TO THREE. ONE...

12:03.053 --> 12:04.124
TWO...

12:04.124 --> 12:06.797
DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS
AFTER THREE?

12:06.797 --> 12:08.128
FOUR?

12:08.128 --> 12:09.800
PUT THE PILLOWS DOWN.

12:12.132 --> 12:15.165
NOW, I AM SURE
YOU'VE HEARD THE EXPRESSION,

12:15.165 --> 12:16.466
"MY HOUSE, MY RULES."

12:16.466 --> 12:17.968
NO.

12:17.968 --> 12:20.140
WELL, THERE IS AN EXPRESSION--
"MY HOUSE, MY RULES."

12:20.140 --> 12:22.873
AND AS LONG AS YOU ARE
STAYING HERE WITH ME,

12:22.873 --> 12:25.175
YOU WILL BEHAVE PROPERLY.
YOU WILL MIND YOUR MANNERS,

12:25.175 --> 12:28.348
YOU WILL DO YOUR CHORES.
YOU WILL LISTEN WHEN SPOKEN TO.

12:28.348 --> 12:31.852
AND--
WHERE ARE THEY GOING?

12:31.852 --> 12:35.085
HMM? I WASN'T PAYING ATTENTION.
WHAT WERE YOU TELLING 'EM?

12:35.085 --> 12:39.189
GIRLS, GET BACK HERE!

12:41.261 --> 12:44.835
DON'T SMIRK. THE KEY
TO DISCIPLINE IS CONSISTENCY.

12:44.835 --> 12:48.198
AND I WILL NOT GIVE UP.

12:48.198 --> 12:50.770
NEITHER WILL THEY, BREE.

12:50.770 --> 12:53.874
NEITHER WILL THEY.

12:53.874 --> 12:57.808
(telephone ringing,
indistinct conversations,

12:57.808 --> 13:00.951
WOW, IF I KNEW TOM WAS WORKING
WITH SO MANY HANDSOME RICH MEN,

13:00.951 --> 13:02.953
I WOULD HAVE WORN
A LOWER TOP.

13:02.953 --> 13:05.986
LOWER? I THINK YOU WOULD
CALL THAT A BELT.

13:05.986 --> 13:09.319
WILL YOU LOOK AT THIS?
HE'S KEPT US WAITING 45 MINUTES.

13:09.319 --> 13:12.823
GOOD TO SEE BEING MARRIED TO
THE BOSS GAVE US THE LEG UP.

13:12.823 --> 13:14.825
AH. IF HE KEEPS US
WAITING ANY LONGER,

13:14.825 --> 13:17.898
I KNOW TWO LEGS
THAT WON'T BE GOING UP.

13:17.898 --> 13:19.529
(sighs) SORRY ABOUT THE WAIT.

13:19.529 --> 13:21.571
I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE
WITH LONDON.

13:21.571 --> 13:25.035
CLOSED A DEAL WORTH $10 MILLION.
PHYLLIS?

13:25.035 --> 13:27.577
(chuckles) OKAY, LADIES,
I HAVE 15 MINUTES,

13:27.577 --> 13:31.281
AND THEY ARE ALL YOURS.
 THAT IS ALL WE NEED.

13:33.083 --> 13:37.087
THE OVERALL LOOK WE'RE GOING FOR
IS VERY WARM AND INVITING.

13:37.087 --> 13:41.421
WE'RE THINKING SOFT WOOD,
AN OVERSTUFFED LINEN SOFA,

13:41.421 --> 13:45.195
THAT SOUNDS GREAT,
BUT I ALREADY KNOW WHAT I WANT.

13:45.195 --> 13:48.198
RIPPED THAT OUT OF A MAGAZINE.

13:48.198 --> 13:51.862
(laughs)
THIS IS DONALD TRUMP'S OFFICE.

13:51.862 --> 13:53.163
ISN'T IT COOL?

13:53.163 --> 13:56.136
I-I LOVE THAT DESK--
BLACK MARBLE AND CHROME.

13:56.136 --> 14:01.111
A-AND LOOK AT THAT SAMURAI SWORD
AND THOSE DRAGON LAMPS.

14:01.111 --> 14:04.114
I'M SORRY. ARE YOU PLANNING
TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD

14:04.114 --> 14:05.275
WITH YOUR DEATH RAY?

14:05.275 --> 14:08.218
I THINK THIS IS IMPRESSIVE.

14:08.218 --> 14:09.980
BUT... IT'S NOT YOU.

14:09.980 --> 14:12.983
YOU'D NEED A TELEPHONE BOOK
TO SIT BEHIND THAT DESK.

14:12.983 --> 14:15.455
LYNETTE, IF THIS IS WHAT
OUR CLIENT WANTS...

14:15.455 --> 14:17.857
THANK YOU, RENEE.

14:17.857 --> 14:19.859
YOU KNOW, WHEN DOUG PLAYED
FOR THE YANKEES,

14:19.859 --> 14:22.162
"THE DONALD" INVITED US
ON HIS YACHT ALL THE TIME.

14:22.162 --> 14:24.134
I'LL JUST CALL HIS ASSISTANT

14:24.134 --> 14:26.136
AND FIND OUT
WHERE THEY GOT THE DESK.

14:26.136 --> 14:28.168
"THE DONALD."

14:28.168 --> 14:31.241
YOU'RE WONDERING IF YOU CAN
PULL OFF "THE TOM," AREN'T YOU?

14:31.241 --> 14:32.602
NO.

14:32.602 --> 14:36.406
GOOD, BECAUSE THE IDEA OF YOU
IN AN OFFICE LIKE THIS--

14:36.406 --> 14:38.078
IS TOTALLY WORKABLE.

14:38.078 --> 14:40.650
WHY DON'T WE GET SOME PIECES
IN HERE OVER THE WEEKEND?

14:40.650 --> 14:45.185
AND YOU CAN TAKE A LOOK
ON MONDAY.
 NOW THAT IS THE ATTITUDE
I LIKE--CAN-DO.

14:45.185 --> 14:49.889
I HAVE A MEETING.
GREAT WORK, EVERYONE. MM.

14:49.889 --> 14:52.422
SEE PHYLLIS ON THE WAY OUT.
SHE'LL VALIDATE YOUR PARKING.

14:52.422 --> 14:55.425
WOW, THAT WAS EASY.
I KNOW A PLACE THAT HAS

14:55.425 --> 14:58.468
THESE FABULOUS
CHROME AND STEEL PIECES.
 WE'RE NOT DOING THAT.

14:58.468 --> 15:01.271
WHY NOT?
 BECAUSE THAT'S NOT TOM.

15:01.271 --> 15:04.404
HE'S DEFINITELY
A SOFT WOOD KIND OF GUY.

15:04.404 --> 15:06.506
OKAY, LESSON ONE--
TOM IS THE CLIENT.

15:06.506 --> 15:10.180
IF HE WANTS A BIG SHOT OFFICE,
HE GETS IT.
 UGH!

15:10.180 --> 15:13.113
AND LESSON TWO--
NO MAN WANTS TO BE REFERRED TO

15:13.113 --> 15:15.515
AS "SOFT WOOD."

15:15.515 --> 15:19.249
(sighs) FELICIA.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

15:19.249 --> 15:21.251
I'M SORRY TO DROP BY
WITHOUT CALLING.

15:21.251 --> 15:23.693
IS THIS A BAD TIME?

15:23.693 --> 15:26.526
YEAH, IT IS. UH, I'M IN
THE MIDDLE OF COOKING DINNER.

15:26.526 --> 15:28.228
OF COURSE.

15:28.228 --> 15:29.529
I-I JUST...

15:29.529 --> 15:33.333
I WAS MISSING BETH SO MUCH,
AND...

15:33.333 --> 15:38.138
THEN I REMEMBERED THAT PART OF
HER WAS STILL ALIVE SOMEWHERE.

15:38.138 --> 15:40.140
COULD YOU SPARE
A FEW MINUTES

15:40.140 --> 15:42.242
FOR A WOMAN WHO LOST
HER ONLY CHILD?

15:42.242 --> 15:46.176
SURE. COME IN.

15:48.248 --> 15:50.150
SMELLS GOOD.

15:50.150 --> 15:53.323
OH, IT'S FOR PAUL.
CHICKEN POT PIE.

15:53.323 --> 15:56.556
RIGHT. YOU SAID
YOU WERE COOKING FOR HIM.

15:56.556 --> 15:58.558
THAT'S SO THOUGHTFUL.

15:58.558 --> 16:01.591
WELL, JUST TRYING
TO BE A GOOD FRIEND.

16:01.591 --> 16:04.164
I HOPE THAT WE
CAN BE FRIENDS, TOO.

16:04.164 --> 16:05.465
YOU DO?

16:05.465 --> 16:08.168
YOU AND ME? FRIENDS?

16:08.168 --> 16:11.601
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.
WHAT I DID TO PAUL WAS HORRIBLE,

16:11.601 --> 16:13.703
BUT THANK GOD,
HE'S FORGIVEN ME,

16:13.703 --> 16:16.546
AND NOW I JUST WANT THINGS
BACK TO NORMAL.

16:16.546 --> 16:20.710
I EVEN GOT THIS GLOVE SO PEOPLE
WOULDN'T BE PUT OFF BY ME.

16:20.710 --> 16:24.184
WHAT, YOU--YOU MEAN
THE FINGER THING?

16:24.184 --> 16:27.317
OH, PEOPLE HARDLY NOTICE IT.
BUT THE GLOVE IS GOOD.

16:29.759 --> 16:31.221
OH...

16:31.221 --> 16:32.522
WHAT'S WRONG?

16:32.522 --> 16:35.425
I... GET THESE MIGRAINES.

16:35.425 --> 16:37.997
COULD I TROUBLE YOU
FOR SOME ASPIRIN?

16:37.997 --> 16:40.730
SURE. HANG ON.

16:45.305 --> 16:47.777
MMM.

16:47.777 --> 16:51.481
THIS SMELLS WONDERFUL.

16:52.782 --> 16:56.516
I WOULDN'T BEGIN TO KNOW HOW
TO MAKE A POT PIE.

16:56.516 --> 16:59.489
WELL, THE CRUST
IS STORE-BOUGHT.

16:59.489 --> 17:01.621
BUT DON'T TELL PAUL,
OKAY?

17:01.621 --> 17:03.723
DON'T YOU WORRY.

17:03.723 --> 17:06.356
I KNOW HOW
TO KEEP A SECRET.

17:18.407 --> 17:20.410
"WITH REPEATED SMALL DOSES
OF THE TOXIN,

17:20.410 --> 17:24.144
DEATH IS BOTH SLOW
AND AGONIZING."

17:24.144 --> 17:27.777
WHAT DID I TELL YOU, DEAR? IT'S
SO MUCH BETTER THAN A BULLET.

17:27.777 --> 17:32.051
"INITIAL SYMPTOMS
INCLUDE NAUSEA AND VOMITING.

17:32.051 --> 17:35.385
"THESE ARE FOLLOWED
BY METABOLIC ACIDOSIS

17:35.385 --> 17:38.228
AND CARDIOVASCULAR DYSFUNCTION."

17:38.228 --> 17:40.560
HE'LL THINK IT'S HIS HEART.

17:40.560 --> 17:43.593
AS IF HE HAD ONE.

17:43.593 --> 17:49.569
"AND FINALLY,
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE AND...

17:49.569 --> 17:52.442
DEATH."

17:52.442 --> 17:55.375
AND YOU KNOW THE BEST PART?

17:55.375 --> 17:59.709
I COULDN'T GET NEAR PAUL'S FOOD
IF IT WEREN'T FOR YOU...

17:59.709 --> 18:02.782
OR AT LEAST
THAT LAST LITTLE PIECE OF YOU

18:02.782 --> 18:05.685
THAT'S STILL ALIVE IN SUSAN.

18:05.685 --> 18:09.789
IT JUST GOES TO SHOW...

18:09.789 --> 18:12.662
YOU MAY BE GONE...

18:12.662 --> 18:14.294
(cap clatters)

18:14.294 --> 18:18.328
BUT WE'RE STILL
ONE HECK OF A TEAM.

18:26.336 --> 18:29.339
♪♪♪

19:01.271 --> 19:04.414
SUSAN, HOW'S HE DOING?

19:04.414 --> 19:07.417
I DON'T GET IT. HE JUST KEEPS
GETTING WORSE AND WORSE.

19:07.417 --> 19:10.350
I THINK I'M GONNA HAVE TO START
BRINGING HIM BREAKFAST, TOO.

19:10.350 --> 19:13.883
YOU'RE A GOOD FRIEND.

19:18.858 --> 19:22.232
DADDY! I MISSED YOU SO MUCH!

19:22.232 --> 19:24.234
OH, I MISSED YOU, TOO.
HO-HO-HO!

19:24.234 --> 19:28.268
WHY DON'T YOU GUYS
GO WASH UP FOR DINNER? GO ON.

19:28.268 --> 19:32.372
SO TOMORROW AFTER SCHOOL,
THEY COME BACK TO ME, RIGHT?

19:32.372 --> 19:34.544
RIGHT.

19:37.577 --> 19:42.412
(sighs) CARLOS,
HOW DID WE GET HERE?

19:42.412 --> 19:45.415
WE'RE TALKING
LIKE A DIVORCED COUPLE.

19:45.415 --> 19:47.717
(sighs)
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY?

19:47.717 --> 19:50.920
JUST TELL ME HOW LONG
THIS IS GONNA GO ON.

19:50.920 --> 19:54.264
HOW LONG ARE YOU GONNA
BE FRIENDS WITH BREE?

19:54.264 --> 19:55.625
CARLOS--

19:55.625 --> 19:58.398
'CAUSE THAT IS HOW LONG
IT'S GONNA GO ON.

20:01.731 --> 20:04.404
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

20:04.404 --> 20:06.406
GIVING MY PLANT A DRINK.

20:09.379 --> 20:11.381
WHY DO YOU HATE MOMMY
SO MUCH?

20:13.413 --> 20:17.247
I DON'T HATE MOMMY.
I JUST...

20:17.247 --> 20:19.349
I'M MAD AT SOMETHING
BREE DID.

20:19.349 --> 20:20.720
WHAT DID SHE DO?

20:20.720 --> 20:24.294
WELL... IT'S KIND OF
A GROWN-UP THING, HONEY.

20:24.294 --> 20:26.296
YOU GUYS SAY THAT
ABOUT EVERYTHING

20:26.296 --> 20:28.298
YOU DON'T WANNA TALK ABOUT.

20:30.430 --> 20:32.402
YOU'RE RIGHT.

20:32.402 --> 20:34.904
SIT.

20:38.308 --> 20:42.412
(clears throat)

20:42.412 --> 20:44.243
YOU KNOW GRANDMA DIED.

20:46.276 --> 20:51.281
BUT YOU NEVER HEARD THE STORY
OF HOW IT HAPPENED.

20:51.281 --> 20:54.984
HEY, HAVE YOU SEEN
OUR BANK STATEMENT?

20:54.984 --> 20:57.487
I'M IN THE MIDDLE
OF A QUIZ.

20:57.487 --> 21:00.560
WELL, I THINK YOU MIGHT
LIKE THIS A LOT BETTER THAN...

21:00.560 --> 21:02.492
"ARE YOU HAVING
ENOUGH ORGASMS?"

21:04.564 --> 21:07.697
OH! (sighs)
I JUST HAD ONE.

21:07.697 --> 21:10.570
WE ACTUALLY HAVE MONEY!

21:10.570 --> 21:14.574
WE PAID ALL OF OUR BILLS,
AND WE HAVE MONEY LEFT OVER.

21:14.574 --> 21:17.276
WELL, THE INSURANCE
IS COVERING YOUR SURGERY 100%,

21:17.276 --> 21:19.809
AND ADD THAT TO THE MONEY YOU
WON PLAYING POKER--BY THE WAY,

21:19.809 --> 21:23.353
DON'T DO THAT AGAIN--AND WE'RE
FINALLY OUT OF THE HOLE.

21:23.353 --> 21:26.756
IN FACT, WE CAN AFFORD
TO MOVE BACK INTO OUR OLD HOUSE.

21:26.756 --> 21:28.758
OH, THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

21:28.758 --> 21:31.861
BUT WE CAN'T
UNTIL PAUL'S READY TO LEAVE.

21:31.861 --> 21:34.424
WELL, HE MIGHT BE READY
A LITTLE SOONER

21:34.424 --> 21:36.426
IF HIS NEW BEST BUDDY
ASKED HIM.

21:36.426 --> 21:40.570
MIKE... I'M NOT GONNA
DO THAT TO PAUL.

21:40.570 --> 21:43.533
THINK OF WHAT HE'S BEEN THROUGH.
HE'S A WRECK.

21:43.533 --> 21:45.535
WELL, MAYBE MOVING OUT
OF A HOUSE

21:45.535 --> 21:48.738
FILLED WITH MEMORIES OF BETH
WOULD BE GOOD FOR HIM.

21:48.738 --> 21:50.740
AM I SUPPOSED TO BELIEVE

21:50.740 --> 21:54.984
THAT YOU ARE SUDDENLY INTERESTED
IN PAUL'S WELL-BEING?

21:54.984 --> 21:57.487
LOOK, I DON'T LIKE THE GUY.
I NEVER WILL.

21:57.487 --> 21:59.989
BUT AS LONG AS YOU'RE
TAKING HIM UNDER YOUR WING,

21:59.989 --> 22:02.622
WHY CAN'T WE GET
SOMETHING OUT OF IT?

22:06.626 --> 22:08.327
SO...

22:08.327 --> 22:12.562
NOW DO YOU UNDERSTAND
WHY I'M SO UPSET?

22:12.562 --> 22:15.565
I KNOW IT'S A COMPLICATED STORY.
YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS?

22:15.565 --> 22:17.066
NO, DADDY.

22:17.066 --> 22:18.568
OKAY.

22:18.568 --> 22:23.613
I'M GONNA GO GRAB MY WALLET,
AND WE ARE GONNA GO GET PIZZA.

22:26.776 --> 22:29.479
CELIA, COME HERE.

22:29.479 --> 22:34.053
YOU KNOW WHAT DADDY
JUST TOLD ME?

22:34.053 --> 22:37.427
BREE KILLED GRANDMA.

22:50.740 --> 22:53.372
(footsteps approach)

22:56.676 --> 22:58.848
HELLO, GIRLS.

22:58.848 --> 23:01.911
DID YOU HAVE A NICE TIME
AT YOUR FATHER'S LAST NIGHT?

23:01.911 --> 23:04.414
UH-HUH.

23:04.414 --> 23:06.616
WELL, NOW THAT
YOU'RE BACK AT MY HOUSE,

23:06.616 --> 23:09.619
I'D LIKE TO TRY ONCE AGAIN TO
DISCUSS MY RULES. THAT BE OKAY?

23:12.462 --> 23:15.124
YES, MRS. VAN DE KAMP.

23:25.004 --> 23:26.936
OH, HELLO, GABY.

23:26.936 --> 23:28.838
WHAT IS THIS?

23:28.838 --> 23:31.180
JUANITA'S HELPING ME
MAKE DINNER. GOOD JOB.

23:31.180 --> 23:33.883
NOW AFTER YOU'RE DONE
WASHING THE BRUSSELS SPROUTS,

23:33.883 --> 23:35.885
YOU CAN HELP ME SET THE TABLE.

23:35.885 --> 23:37.687
YES, MRS. VAN DE KAMP.

23:43.493 --> 23:45.424
BRUSSELS SPROUTS?

23:45.424 --> 23:47.727
YOU DO KNOW THE GIRLS
ARE EATING HERE TONIGHT?

23:47.727 --> 23:49.999
YES. DON'T THEY LIKE
BRUSSELS SPROUTS?

23:49.999 --> 23:53.432
SURE... AS PROJECTILES.

23:53.432 --> 23:57.436
WELL, THEY'LL EAT THEM
TONIGHT, OR NO CUPCAKES.

23:57.436 --> 23:59.739
YOU ACTUALLY LEFT THOSE OUT
IN PLAIN SIGHT?

23:59.739 --> 24:02.141
HAVE YOU LEARNED NOTHING?
YOU COULD LOSE THE SIDEBOARD.

24:02.141 --> 24:05.815
OH, THEY WON'T TOUCH THEM,
NOT TILL I TELL THEM THEY CAN.

24:08.818 --> 24:11.521
THANK YOU
FOR STRAIGHTENING UP, CELIA.

24:11.521 --> 24:14.754
NOW WOULD YOU PLEASE HELP
YOUR SISTER IN THE KITCHEN?

24:16.656 --> 24:19.158
OKAY. WHAT THE HELL
DID YOU DO TO THEM?

24:19.158 --> 24:21.460
OH, I SIMPLY SAT THEM DOWN
AND EXPLAINED

24:21.460 --> 24:23.933
WHAT I EXPECTED OF THEM
WHILE THEY'RE STAYING HERE.

24:23.933 --> 24:25.735
OH, CUT THE CRAP,
VAN DE KAMP.

24:25.735 --> 24:27.567
DID YOU GIVE 'EM DRUGS?
THREATEN 'EM?

24:27.567 --> 24:29.198
CHILDREN DON'T
RESPOND TO THREATS.

24:29.198 --> 24:31.901
THEY RESPOND TO STRUCTURE
PROVIDED WITH A FIRM HAND.

24:31.901 --> 24:33.603
SO YOU HIT THEM.

24:33.603 --> 24:35.605
IF YOU STICK TO MY SYSTEM,

24:35.605 --> 24:38.107
BY THE TIME YOU TAKE
THESE GIRLS BACK TO CARLOS,

24:38.107 --> 24:40.109
THEY'LL BE PERFECTLY BEHAVED.
YOU'RE WELCOME.

24:48.918 --> 24:50.660
HEY, SWEETIE.

24:50.660 --> 24:52.992
YOU CAN RELAX.
SHE WENT UPSTAIRS.

24:52.992 --> 24:55.094
NO, I HAVE TO GET THIS DONE.

24:56.596 --> 24:58.127
(sets down dish)

25:01.901 --> 25:04.203
DO YOU WANT A CUPCAKE?

25:04.203 --> 25:08.878
MRS. VAN DE KAMP SAYS
THOSE ARE FOR AFTER DINNER.

25:08.878 --> 25:12.912
WELL, MRS. VAN DE KAMP
ISN'T HERE.

25:12.912 --> 25:15.114
MMM.

25:15.114 --> 25:18.217
I'M NOT SAYING I LOVE THIS
MORE THAN YOU AND CELIA,

25:18.217 --> 25:20.720
BUT IF THE THREE OF YOU
FELL IN A POOL,

25:20.720 --> 25:22.722
AND I COULD ONLY SAVE TWO,

25:22.722 --> 25:26.155
ONE OF YOU WOULD FINALLY
GET HER OWN ROOM.

25:26.155 --> 25:29.859
HERE. SNEAK THIS UPSTAIRS.
EAT IT LATER.

25:29.859 --> 25:34.564
NO, THANKS.
I'LL HAVE AN APPLE.

25:34.564 --> 25:36.205
(footsteps retreat)

25:36.205 --> 25:39.639
WHAT DID SHE DO TO YOU?!
HOW DID SHE BREAK YOU?!

25:39.639 --> 25:41.210
(sighs)

25:47.176 --> 25:49.679
OKAY, THOSE GO RIGHT
IN FRONT OF THE DESK.

25:49.679 --> 25:51.220
YES, MA'AM.

25:51.220 --> 25:53.623
AND WATCH THE... YEAH.
THANK YOU.

25:53.623 --> 25:57.787
UH, WHAT'S GOING ON? I TOLD
THE MOVERS TO BE HERE AT 11:00.

25:57.787 --> 25:59.759
YEAH. I MADE A TEENSY CHANGE.

25:59.759 --> 26:03.833
AND THIS IS NOT
THE FURNITURE I ORDERED.

26:03.833 --> 26:06.596
AGAIN, TEENSY CHANGE.

26:16.646 --> 26:18.207
(scoffs) OH, MY GOD.

26:18.207 --> 26:21.280
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU DID THIS BEHIND MY BACK.

26:21.280 --> 26:23.983
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE A TEAM.
I ALMOST BOUGHT YOU

26:23.983 --> 26:27.316
A COFFEE THIS MORNING
WITHOUT YOU EVEN ASKING.
 BUT YOU DIDN'T.

26:27.316 --> 26:29.358
YEAH, AND I FELT BAD
ABOUT IT...

26:29.358 --> 26:32.361
TILL NOW. (sighs) I'VE GOT
TWO DRAGON LAMPS IN MY CAR.

26:32.361 --> 26:34.864
WHAT THE HELL AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO WITH THOSE?

26:34.864 --> 26:37.897
I'M SORRY, BUT TRUST ME,
I'M SAVING US TIME.

26:37.897 --> 26:40.269
HOW?
TOM SAID WHAT HE WANTS.

26:40.269 --> 26:42.772
TOM SAID
WHAT HE THINKS HE WANTS.

26:42.772 --> 26:46.105
I KNOW WHAT HE REALLY WANTS.
AND YOU HAVE TO ADMIT,

26:46.105 --> 26:49.939
LOOKS PRETTY GOOD, DOESN'T IT?
ALL COMFY AND COZY...

26:49.939 --> 26:51.941
YEAH, LYNETTE,
YOU DID A GREAT JOB

26:51.941 --> 26:53.943
IGNORING WHAT HE ASKED FOR.

26:53.943 --> 26:55.985
ALL THAT'S MISSING
IS AN ANTIQUE JAR

26:55.985 --> 26:59.318
FOR TOM TO PUT
HIS TESTICLES IN.

27:16.105 --> 27:17.737
(inhales sharply)

27:17.737 --> 27:20.009
AAH! AAH!

27:20.009 --> 27:22.011
JUANITA, WHAT IS IT?

27:22.011 --> 27:23.312
GET AWAY! GET AWAY! (screams)

27:23.312 --> 27:24.774
AAH!

27:24.774 --> 27:26.245
YOU'RE JUST HAVING
A NIGHTMARE!

27:26.245 --> 27:28.247
HONEST,
EVERYTHING IS OKAY!

27:28.247 --> 27:30.249
(continues screaming)

27:33.252 --> 27:36.085
THEY WON'T COME OUT.

27:36.085 --> 27:39.028
NOT EVEN FOR YOU?
 NOPE. THAT'S HOW SCARED
YOU GOT THEM.

27:39.028 --> 27:41.030
I SWEAR,
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

27:41.030 --> 27:44.033
I WENT IN TO CHECK ON THEM,
AND THEY GOT HYSTERICAL.

27:44.033 --> 27:46.035
CARLOS, IT'S ME.
WHERE ARE YOU?

27:46.035 --> 27:49.038
THE GIRLS WON'T COME OUT
FOR ANYONE EXCEPT THEIR DADDY.

27:49.038 --> 27:50.339
(doorbell rings)

27:50.339 --> 27:53.242
IT'S ABOUT TIME!

27:53.242 --> 27:56.105
OKAY, CARLOS...
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

27:56.105 --> 27:59.048
DETECTIVE VANCE,
FAIRVIEW P.D.

27:59.048 --> 28:01.811
WE GOT A 9-1-1 CALL
FROM 2 GIRLS

28:01.811 --> 28:05.314
WHO SAY THAT THEIR MOM'S CRAZY
FRIEND IS TRYING TO KILL THEM.

28:05.314 --> 28:06.455
WHAT?

28:06.455 --> 28:08.157
HELLO AGAIN.

28:08.157 --> 28:11.390
I GUESS YOU FOUND SOMEONE
TO LOAN YOU THAT GUN.

28:24.333 --> 28:26.335
OKAY.

28:26.335 --> 28:29.038
I SPOKE WITH THE GIRLS.
THEY'RE PRETTY SURE

28:29.038 --> 28:32.311
THAT MRS. VAN DE KAMP HERE
WAS TRYING TO MURDER THEM.

28:32.311 --> 28:35.344
(scoffs)
WELL, THAT'S PREPOSTEROUS.

28:35.344 --> 28:37.346
WHY WOULD THEY SAY
SUCH A THING?

28:37.346 --> 28:39.248
WELL, THAT'S NOT
ALL THEY SAID.

28:39.248 --> 28:40.489
(knock on door)

28:40.489 --> 28:43.993
GABY? WHAT'S WITH
THE PANICKED PHONE CALLS?
 IT'S NOTHING.

28:43.993 --> 28:47.126
THE GIRLS GOT ALL FREAKED OUT
AND CALLED THE POLICE.

28:47.126 --> 28:48.858
FREAKED OUT ABOUT WHAT?

28:48.858 --> 28:51.460
ARE YOU THE FATHER?
 YEAH. CARLOS SOLIS.

28:51.460 --> 28:54.163
DETECTIVE VANCE. MR. SOLIS,
DID YOU TELL YOUR DAUGHTER

28:54.163 --> 28:56.335
THAT MRS. VAN DE KAMP
KILLED YOUR MOTHER?

29:03.072 --> 29:04.844
DID YOU TELL HER THAT, SIR?

29:09.278 --> 29:12.421
I THINK I KNOW WHAT THIS IS.

29:12.421 --> 29:15.855
ME AND THE GIRLS WERE TALKING
ABOUT MY MOTHER'S DEATH,

29:15.855 --> 29:20.759
AND I SAID BEING APART FROM
THEIR MOM FELT ALMOST AS BAD,

29:20.759 --> 29:25.764
AND I SAID
THAT I BLAMED BREE FOR THAT.

29:25.764 --> 29:27.496
THEY MUST HAVE
GOTTEN CONFUSED.

29:27.496 --> 29:30.769
YEAH, WELL,
DON'T BE MAD AT THEM.

29:30.769 --> 29:33.442
IT'S HARD ON KIDS
WHEN THEIR PARENTS ARE APART.

29:33.442 --> 29:36.876
IT'S ACTUALLY KIND OF FUNNY
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT.

29:36.876 --> 29:38.377
(chuckles)

29:38.377 --> 29:43.012
I MEAN, NOT "FUNNY" FUNNY,
BUT SAD... FUNNY.

29:43.012 --> 29:44.013
DADDY!

29:44.013 --> 29:45.314
HEY, GIRLS...

29:45.314 --> 29:49.058
SO SORRY TO HAVE DRAGGED YOU OUT
HERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

29:49.058 --> 29:52.521
NO PROBLEM. I HOPE EVERYTHING...
YOU KNOW, WORKS OUT.

29:52.521 --> 29:55.394
LET ME WALK YOU TO YOUR CAR.

29:55.394 --> 29:58.928
LET'S GO PACK YOUR STUFF.
I'M TAKING YOU HOME.

29:58.928 --> 30:01.000
(footsteps retreat upstairs)

30:03.472 --> 30:05.234
(door closes)

30:05.234 --> 30:07.236
I'M GLAD YOU DIDN'T
KILL SOMEONE.

30:07.236 --> 30:09.238
I'D HAVE FELT PRETTY DUMB

30:09.238 --> 30:11.540
FOR NOT ARRESTING YOU
WHEN I HAD THE CHANCE.

30:11.540 --> 30:14.543
UH, TELL ME SOMETHING.
WHEN SOMEONE CALLS 9-1-1,

30:14.543 --> 30:17.416
DON'T THEY USUALLY
JUST SEND A PATROLMAN?

30:17.416 --> 30:20.349
I WAS AT DISPATCH
WHEN THE CALL CAME THROUGH.

30:20.349 --> 30:23.352
WHEN I HEARD THE ADDRESS,
I SAID, "I'LL TAKE IT."

30:25.424 --> 30:28.097
I WANTED TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

30:28.097 --> 30:29.398
REALLY?

30:29.398 --> 30:31.931
ABOUT WHAT?

30:31.931 --> 30:35.404
YOUR NEIGHBOR, MRS. TILLMAN.
HERE'S MY CARD.

30:35.404 --> 30:38.407
IF YOU SEE ANYTHING SUSPICIOUS,
I WANT YOU TO CALL ME.

30:38.407 --> 30:39.268
OKAY.

30:39.268 --> 30:43.312
OR EVEN IF YOU DON'T.

30:43.312 --> 30:45.214
WHAT IS IT ABOUT YOU?

30:45.214 --> 30:47.516
I NEVER HAVE A CLUE
WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.

30:47.516 --> 30:52.421
I'M A DETECTIVE.
I FIND CLUES. I DON'T GIVE THEM.

30:52.421 --> 30:55.424
GOOD NIGHT, CITIZEN.

30:55.424 --> 30:58.327
GOOD NIGHT, DETECTIVE.

31:00.960 --> 31:03.392
(car door opens and closes)

31:03.392 --> 31:05.464
(engine starts)

31:05.464 --> 31:08.467
THEY ARE ALMOST
DONE PACKING.

31:08.467 --> 31:10.199
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU TOLD THEM.

31:10.199 --> 31:12.201
JUANITA WANTED TO KNOW
WHY WE WERE FIGHTING.

31:12.201 --> 31:14.203
I TOLD HER THE TRUTH.

31:14.203 --> 31:16.505
GREAT. SO NOW THEY THINK
MOMMY WALKED OUT ON DADDY

31:16.505 --> 31:19.348
TO LIVE WITH THE LADY
THAT KILLED GRANDMA?

31:19.348 --> 31:22.351
WELL, THAT IS KIND OF
WHAT YOU DID. AND I NEVER SAID

31:22.351 --> 31:25.054
THAT BREE KILLED THEIR GRANDMA.
I SAID THAT SHE HELPED

31:25.054 --> 31:27.886
THE PERSON WHO DID KILL HER
GET AWAY WITH IT.

31:27.886 --> 31:29.588
YES.
SHE WAS PROTECTING HER CHILD,

31:29.588 --> 31:32.421
WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT WE'D DO
IF IT WAS OUR KID IN TROUBLE.

31:32.421 --> 31:34.123
FAMILIES STICK TOGETHER.

31:34.123 --> 31:35.965
THEN WHY ARE YOU
LIVING HERE?

31:35.965 --> 31:39.298
WHY DID YOU PICK BREE
OVER ME?

31:39.298 --> 31:42.371
(door opens and closes)

31:42.371 --> 31:43.672
CARLOS, THANK YOU

31:43.672 --> 31:47.306
FOR NOT SAYING ANYTHING
IN FRONT OF THAT POLICEMAN.

31:47.306 --> 31:49.478
YOU THINK I DID THIS
FOR YOU?

31:49.478 --> 31:52.181
WELL, I JUST ASSUMED--
 THAT WAS FOR ANDREW.

31:52.181 --> 31:55.344
HE WAS A KID WHEN ALL
THIS HAPPENED. YOU WEREN'T.

31:55.344 --> 31:57.616
OKAY, LAY OFF HER, CARLOS. SHE'S
APOLOGIZED AGAIN AND AGAIN.

31:57.616 --> 32:00.319
WELL, I DON'T FORGIVE HER,
AND AS LONG AS

32:00.319 --> 32:04.253
YOU'RE TAKING HER SIDE,
I DON'T FORGIVE YOU, EITHER.

32:04.253 --> 32:06.125
WE'RE READY, DADDY.

32:06.125 --> 32:07.426
LET'S GO HOME.

32:12.401 --> 32:13.702
(door closes)

32:13.702 --> 32:17.466
I'M SORRY. I JUST KEEP WAITING
FOR THIS TO BLOW OVER.

32:17.466 --> 32:21.240
WE HAVE TO FACE IT, GABY.
THIS IS NEVER GONNA BLOW OVER.

32:21.240 --> 32:24.543
SO WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

32:24.543 --> 32:27.446
YOU'RE GONNA GO HOME
TO YOUR HUSBAND.

32:27.446 --> 32:30.379
I FEEL GUILTY ENOUGH
ABOUT CARLOS LOSING HIS MOTHER.

32:30.379 --> 32:35.384
I WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE
FOR HIM LOSING HIS WIFE.

32:38.187 --> 32:41.460
THAT MEANS YOU AND ME...

32:41.460 --> 32:43.562
YEAH.

32:43.562 --> 32:46.195
I KNOW.

32:52.101 --> 32:53.702
I'LL CALL YOU, OKAY?

32:53.702 --> 32:55.404
PLEASE...

32:55.404 --> 32:57.506
DON'T.

33:04.183 --> 33:08.357
THESE LOOK DELICIOUS.
NICELY DONE.

33:08.357 --> 33:10.459
WELL, I HAD HELP.

33:10.459 --> 33:12.491
I JUST STIRRED THE BATTER.

33:12.491 --> 33:16.995
A VERY IMPORTANT JOB,
SO YOU GET TO TRY THE FIRST ONE.

33:16.995 --> 33:19.498
NO.

33:19.498 --> 33:22.371
I DON'T WANT TO
SPOIL MY DINNER.

33:22.371 --> 33:24.373
PLEASE? I WANT TO KNOW

33:24.373 --> 33:26.705
THAT THEY TASTE GOOD,
AND I'M ALLERGIC TO NUTS.

33:30.139 --> 33:36.145
WELL, I... I GUESS THAT
MAKES ME THE... GUINEA PIG.

33:36.145 --> 33:38.387
(chuckles)

33:41.150 --> 33:44.093
BEST I'VE EVER TASTED.

33:47.356 --> 33:52.061
BUT... NOT GOOD ENOUGH
TO FINISH?

33:52.061 --> 33:53.362
THEY'RE TERRIBLE,
AREN'T THEY?

33:53.362 --> 33:56.535
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M GONNA
TOSS THESE AND START AGAIN.

33:56.535 --> 33:58.767
NO. YOU CAN'T. I...

33:58.767 --> 34:02.171
I JUST DIDN'T WANT
TO BREAK MY DIET...

34:02.171 --> 34:03.172
(laughs)

34:03.172 --> 34:06.445
BUT WHO CAN RESIST
WITH THESE?

34:08.577 --> 34:10.518
THEY'RE REALLY GOOD?

34:10.518 --> 34:15.784
LIKE NOTHING
I HAVE EVER EATEN.

34:15.784 --> 34:18.786
I'M GONNA GET YOU SOME MILK
TO WASH THAT DOWN.

34:18.786 --> 34:20.359
NO, I CAN'T STAY.

34:20.359 --> 34:22.791
I, UH...

34:22.791 --> 34:25.534
NEED TO GO BUY
A NEW HANDBAG.

34:25.534 --> 34:28.337
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT ONE?

34:28.337 --> 34:30.599
(gags)

34:38.746 --> 34:41.409
MY KEYS...

34:51.690 --> 34:55.194
(indistinct conversations,
telephone rings)

34:55.194 --> 34:57.466
YOU'RE NOT STILL
MAD AT ME, ARE YOU?

34:57.466 --> 34:59.398
NO. I'M GOOD.

34:59.398 --> 35:01.130
BECAUSE I THINK

35:01.130 --> 35:04.133
WE'RE GONNA SEE A HAPPY CLIENT
WALK OUT OF HIS NEW OFFICE.

35:04.133 --> 35:05.804
(sighs)

35:05.804 --> 35:10.108
ANY SECOND NOW.

35:13.812 --> 35:16.645
YOU TWO... (sighs)
 (door closes)

35:16.645 --> 35:19.518
(telephone ringing)

35:19.518 --> 35:22.491
I LOVE IT!

35:22.491 --> 35:24.893
YOU DO?
 LOVE IT!

35:24.893 --> 35:26.395
YOU DO! HEY...

35:26.395 --> 35:27.896
MWAH.

35:27.896 --> 35:30.399
WELL, YOU LIVE WITH SOMEONE
FOR 25 YEARS,

35:30.399 --> 35:33.402
YOU MIGHT KNOW A THING OR TWO
ABOUT A THING OR TWO.

35:33.402 --> 35:35.464
COME ON.

35:44.543 --> 35:46.515
BUT... THAT'S NOT...

35:46.515 --> 35:49.578
WHERE WE TOLD THEM
TO PUT THE DESK.

35:49.578 --> 35:52.421
YOU'RE RIGHT, LYNETTE.

35:52.421 --> 35:54.683
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
IT'S PERFECT RIGHT HERE.

35:54.683 --> 35:57.386
I MEAN, LOOK AT THIS!
THE ONLY WAY

35:57.386 --> 36:01.890
IT COULD BE MORE INTIMIDATING
IS IF FLAMES SHOT OUT OF IT.

36:01.890 --> 36:04.393
IS THERE ANY WAY
THAT WE COULD...

36:04.393 --> 36:06.895
NAH! FORGET IT.

36:06.895 --> 36:09.538
AND WHAT IS IT ABOUT LEATHER
THAT JUST SAYS,

36:09.538 --> 36:11.640
"I OWN YOUR ASS."

36:11.640 --> 36:14.803
OH, I'M OUT OF ORDER?
NO, YOU'RE OUT OF ORDER.

36:14.803 --> 36:18.247
GET OUT! (laughs)

36:18.247 --> 36:20.178
SO YOU REALLY LIKE THIS?

36:20.178 --> 36:23.181
I LOVE IT. YOU KNOW,
I WAS A LITTLE WORRIED ABOUT

36:23.181 --> 36:25.714
HOW THIS WAS GONNA WORK OUT,
BUT YOU CAME THROUGH.

36:25.714 --> 36:27.716
I MEAN, YOU CAPTURED IT.
IT'S AMAZING.

36:27.716 --> 36:29.418
I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT'S AMAZING--

36:29.418 --> 36:32.421
THE RUG THAT WE HAVEN'T PUT DOWN
YET. LET'S GET TO THAT SHOWROOM,

36:32.421 --> 36:34.563
LYNETTE, BEFORE SOME
OTHER HOTSHOT TAKES IT.

36:34.563 --> 36:36.465
THANKS AGAIN.

36:36.465 --> 36:38.427
HEY...

36:38.427 --> 36:40.729
HOW COULD YOU DO THAT?

36:40.729 --> 36:42.671
DO WHAT?
MAKE OUR CUSTOMER HAPPY?

36:42.671 --> 36:44.373
OH, HE'S KIDDING HIMSELF.

36:44.373 --> 36:46.805
THAT TESTOSTERONE TRAP
IS NOT TOM.

36:46.805 --> 36:49.478
MAYBE IT'S NOT THE TOM
WHO'S BEEN PITCHING IN

36:49.478 --> 36:52.481
WITH CARPOOL THE PAST FEW YEARS,
BUT THE TOM WHO'S RUNNING

36:52.481 --> 36:55.414
THIS COMPANY? YEAH, IT IS,
AND YOU NEED TO ACCEPT THAT.

36:57.416 --> 36:59.248
YOU'RE NOT GONNA ACCEPT THAT.

36:59.248 --> 37:00.819
NO.

37:05.824 --> 37:07.496
YOU CANNOT BE SERIOUS.

37:07.496 --> 37:10.259
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

37:10.259 --> 37:15.604
THIS. THIS WHOLE MASTER
OF THE UNIVERSE PLAYROOM.

37:15.604 --> 37:17.706
I-I THOUGHT YOU LIKED IT.

37:17.706 --> 37:21.009
(chuckles) I... HATE IT.

37:21.009 --> 37:24.413
THEN WHY DID YOU
DO IT THIS WAY?

37:24.413 --> 37:27.015
I DIDN'T! I HAD
A WHOLE OTHER OFFICE IN HERE!

37:27.015 --> 37:29.017
THEN RENEE
CAME AND CHANGED IT.

37:29.017 --> 37:33.352
THEN GOOD FOR RENEE.
AT LEAST ONE OF YOU GETS ME.

37:33.352 --> 37:34.353
TOM...

37:34.353 --> 37:35.354
(sighs)

37:35.354 --> 37:37.656
THIS OFFICE
IS NOT WHO YOU ARE.

37:37.656 --> 37:40.329
YOU'RE A GREAT,
DOWN-TO-EARTH GUY,

37:40.329 --> 37:44.733
NOT SOME JERK THAT HAS TO
SHOW PEOPLE HOW POWERFUL HE IS.

37:44.733 --> 37:46.895
I AM POWERFUL...

37:46.895 --> 37:49.598
AND I DO NEED TO SHOW IT.

37:49.598 --> 37:53.472
I AM SURROUNDED BY GUNSLINGER
KIDS WHO'D STEAL THIS JOB

37:53.472 --> 37:56.545
IN A HEARTBEAT IF THEY WEREN'T
A LITTLE SCARED OF ME.

37:56.545 --> 37:59.007
I HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY,

37:59.007 --> 38:01.450
AND I PLAY IT DAMN WELL,

38:01.450 --> 38:04.813
AND I'M SORRY
IF THAT THREATENS YOU.

38:04.813 --> 38:06.515
IT DOESN'T THREATEN ME.

38:06.515 --> 38:09.458
I JUST DON'T WANT TO
LOSE THE GUY I MARRIED.

38:09.458 --> 38:10.989
OH,
YOU MEAN TOM THE SCREWUP?

38:10.989 --> 38:13.992
THE ONE WHO COULDN'T MAKE A "GO"
OF THE PIZZA PARLOR? THE ONE

38:13.992 --> 38:16.995
YOU COULD ALWAYS PUT YOUR ARM
AROUND AT THE END OF THE DAY,

38:16.995 --> 38:19.498
AND SAY, "IT'S OKAY, HONEY.
I'LL GET US THROUGH"?

38:19.498 --> 38:22.431
DON'T MAKE IT SOUND LIKE
I'M NOT GLAD YOU'RE SUCCEEDING,

38:22.431 --> 38:25.734
'CAUSE I AM.
 YOU SAY THAT.
YOU SAY THAT ALL THE TIME,

38:25.734 --> 38:29.508
BUT I AM WAITING FOR A SIGN TO
SEE THAT YOU ACTUALLY MEAN IT.

38:29.508 --> 38:32.381
AND I THOUGHT THIS OFFICE
WAS THAT SIGN.

38:32.381 --> 38:34.643
I MEAN, I WALKED IN HERE
AND I THOUGHT,

38:34.643 --> 38:41.590
"HOW GREAT IS THIS? SHE GETS IT.
SHE'S HAPPY. SHE'S PROUD OF ME."

38:41.590 --> 38:43.792
MY MISTAKE.

38:43.792 --> 38:46.024
(intercom beeps)

38:48.497 --> 38:49.798
(click)

38:49.798 --> 38:51.500
YEAH?

38:51.500 --> 38:53.532
(Phyllis) Ed Nicks. You in?

38:56.004 --> 38:57.506
YES.

38:57.506 --> 39:00.709
W-WE CAN'T END
THE CONVERSATION LIKE THIS.

39:00.709 --> 39:04.813
(lowered voice)
I HAVE TO TAKE THIS CALL.

39:07.976 --> 39:10.819
(normal voice)
HEY, EDDIE, HOW ARE YA?

39:10.819 --> 39:12.651
WHAT, ARE YOU KIDDING?

39:12.651 --> 39:16.655
THE CHANCE TO KICK YOUR ASS
AT GOLF AND TAKE YOUR MONEY?

39:16.655 --> 39:19.428
YOU DON'T HAVE TO ASK ME TWICE.

39:19.428 --> 39:20.729
TUESDAY WORKS.

39:20.729 --> 39:23.732
YEAH, I'LL LET YOU HIT
FROM THE LADIES' TEES.

39:23.732 --> 39:26.395
(chuckles)

39:33.442 --> 39:34.743
(sighs)

39:34.743 --> 39:36.445
(thud, dish clatters)

39:36.445 --> 39:37.746
NO GOOD, HUH?

39:37.746 --> 39:40.849
NO, I'M JUST NOT
VERY HUNGRY THESE DAYS.

39:40.849 --> 39:43.381
ARE YOU OKAY?

39:43.381 --> 39:44.853
A LITTLE DIZZY.

39:44.853 --> 39:47.416
SIT. I'LL CLEAN UP.

39:51.790 --> 39:55.594
OH, UM, YOU TOOK DOWN
BETH'S PAINTING?

39:55.594 --> 39:59.828
YEAH. SOME DAYS IT'S NICE TO BE
REMINDED OF HER, BUT OTHERS...

39:59.828 --> 40:01.870
IT'S TOO MANY MEMORIES.

40:03.932 --> 40:07.536
HEY, UM... DID YOU EVER THINK
LIVING IN THIS HOUSE

40:07.536 --> 40:10.539
MIGHT BE ONE OF THE REASONS
YOU FEEL SO BAD?

40:10.539 --> 40:14.483
MAYBE YOU COULD USE
A CHANGE OF SCENERY?

40:14.483 --> 40:16.515
YOU MEAN LEAVE FAIRVIEW?

40:16.515 --> 40:19.017
NO, NO, NO, JUST THIS HOUSE.

40:19.017 --> 40:23.091
I COULDN'T DO THAT TO YOU. WHERE
YOU GONNA FIND ANOTHER TENANT?

40:23.091 --> 40:26.495
WELL, THAT'S THE GREAT PART.
MIKE AND I HAVE BEEN SAVING UP,

40:26.495 --> 40:29.658
AND NOW WE'RE READY
TO MOVE BACK IN.

40:33.632 --> 40:36.104
I'M AN IDIOT.

40:36.104 --> 40:38.767
WHAT?

40:38.767 --> 40:40.639
VERY IMPRESSIVE, SUSAN.

40:40.639 --> 40:43.572
I ACTUALLY THOUGHT
YOU GAVE A DAMN ABOUT ME.

40:43.572 --> 40:45.774
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
OF COURSE I DO.

40:45.774 --> 40:48.477
BRINGING ME FOOD,
CHECKING IN ON ME--

40:48.477 --> 40:50.479
IT WAS
A MASTERFUL PERFORMANCE.

40:50.479 --> 40:53.021
MUST HAVE BEEN HARD
BEING PATIENT, THOUGH--

40:53.021 --> 40:55.684
NOT SHOW YOUR HAND TOO SOON.

40:55.684 --> 40:59.858
YOU DON'T GIVE A CRAP ABOUT ME.
IT'S THIS HOUSE YOU WANTED.

40:59.858 --> 41:01.830
(dish clatters)
 NO, PAUL, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

41:01.830 --> 41:03.832
I SWEAR,
MIKE SUGGESTED IT, AND--

41:03.832 --> 41:06.535
MIKE.
OF COURSE HE'S IN ON IT.

41:06.535 --> 41:09.668
I BET YOU HAD A HELL OF A TIME
PLANNING OUT THE WHOLE THING.

41:09.668 --> 41:11.970
I KNEW NOBODY ON THIS STREET
CARED ABOUT ME,

41:11.970 --> 41:14.943
BUT FOR YOU TO PRETEND YOU DID
JUST TO GET SOMETHING OUT OF ME,

41:14.943 --> 41:17.646
THAT MAKES YOU
THE WORST ONE OF ALL!

41:17.646 --> 41:19.147
PAUL, PLEASE. OH! AAH!

41:19.147 --> 41:23.081
LEAVE ME ALONE!
AND THIS TIME, I MEAN IT.

41:29.988 --> 41:35.493
PEOPLE DO GOOD DEEDS
FOR MANY REASONS,

41:35.493 --> 41:41.530
BUT SOMETIMES GOOD DEEDS
HAVE BAD CONSEQUENCES.

41:43.602 --> 41:47.576
CORRECTING A COLLEAGUE'S
MISTAKE COULD BREED RESENTMENT.

41:49.578 --> 41:52.881
OPENING ONE'S HOME TO A FRIEND

41:52.881 --> 41:57.015
CAN DAMAGE THAT FRIENDSHIP.

41:59.087 --> 42:01.650
TRYING TO BRING A SPOUSE CLOSER

42:01.650 --> 42:04.893
MIGHT PUSH HER FURTHER AWAY.

42:06.524 --> 42:08.026
THAT'S WHY

42:08.026 --> 42:12.100
THERE'S AN OLD EXPRESSION
ABOUT HELPING PEOPLE--

42:12.100 --> 42:15.704
NO GOOD DEED...

42:17.706 --> 42:20.939
GOES UNPUNISHED.

42:20.939 --> 42:22.941
(pants)

42:22.941 --> 42:24.943
(gasps)

42:24.943 --> 42:26.645
(pants)

42:26.645 --> 42:29.648
(gasps)

42:29.648 --> 42:32.651
(pants)
