Right here.
What? No...

01:12:22.972 --> 01:12:25.642
The Vatican has been used
as a papal residence

01:12:25.675 --> 01:12:27.944
ever since the time of
Emperor Constantine
the Great

Scusate.

01:12:59.242 --> 01:13:02.579
One of our English-speaking

has called in sick.

01:13:02.612 --> 01:13:03.980
Could you please take
these peoples also?

01:13:07.884 --> 01:13:09.352
How big is Vatican City?

01:13:09.385 --> 01:13:10.820
.5 square kilometers.

01:13:11.488 --> 01:13:12.989
Who built the colonnades?

01:13:13.022 --> 01:13:15.925
Gianlorenzo Bernini, 1656.

01:13:15.959 --> 01:13:17.026
Where are the bathrooms?

01:13:17.060 --> 01:13:18.962
Floors 2, 6 and 7.

01:13:18.995 --> 01:13:22.265
Next I'll take you to where
the College of Cardinals
elects a new pope.

01:13:22.298 --> 01:13:25.735
When this happens, white smoke
is sent up from the Vatican.
Here's a fun fact...

01:13:25.769 --> 01:13:27.070
Mieke's gotta be
around here somewhere.

01:13:42.852 --> 01:13:44.020
We're obviously
not permitted.

Excuse me, miss.
What is this?

01:13:48.692 --> 01:13:50.594
That is the bell
of San Marco.

01:13:50.627 --> 01:13:52.996
When the Pope dies,
the Cardinal Vicar of Rome

01:13:53.029 --> 01:13:55.765
rings this bell to notify
the people of Rome.

01:13:55.799 --> 01:13:58.434
Next we will view
the Sistine Chapel.
Follow me, please.

01:14:02.271 --> 01:14:03.907

01:14:03.940 --> 01:14:06.275

Which way did they go?

01:14:06.309 --> 01:14:08.512
That way. I'd stake
my reputation on it.

01:14:08.545 --> 01:14:10.013
Good enough for me.

Hey, check it out!
I wonder what this does.

01:14:14.984 --> 01:14:17.153

it's a rope.

an open-field tackle.

Touchdown, Pope!

01:15:17.647 --> 01:15:19.415

a two-point conversion.
