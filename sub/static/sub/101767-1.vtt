01:18.967 --> 01:21.759
How long
will it still take, Daddy?

01:24.467 --> 01:27.467
Only a couple of hours,
sweetie.

01:38.550 --> 01:42.842
I'm bored...
Are we there yet?

01:47.800 --> 01:49.050
Look...

01:50.050 --> 01:53.842
We are still over the Atlantic.

01:54.383 --> 01:57.425
With that in mind you can
very well tell

01:57.508 --> 01:59.008
how long it will take.

02:00.425 --> 02:05.425
You see...
Take a look outside the window,

02:05.675 --> 02:10.425
and check out which animals
you see in the clouds.

03:40.217 --> 03:42.091
...And
forgive us our trespasses...

03:42.175 --> 03:43.717
Chill a while, sister.

03:44.966 --> 03:46.300
You shouldn't worry.

03:47.008 --> 03:48.091
We're in God's hands.

03:49.217 --> 03:52.717
Oh father.
I'm such a nervous flyer.

03:54.925 --> 03:56.717
Have faith, sister.

03:58.050 --> 04:01.175
I suppose they told you the
story when I came a priest?

04:01.258 --> 04:02.800
Or how I became a priest.

04:02.883 --> 04:07.133
Oh. Well I heard it was
a miraculous conversion.

04:07.217 --> 04:10.342
That you were one of those
awful L.A. gang members.

04:10.425 --> 04:13.383
You'd let Satan into your soul.

04:14.383 --> 04:16.300
More than that, sister.

04:18.216 --> 04:20.800
Satan had parked his car

04:20.882 --> 04:22.882
right outside the house
of my soul.

04:22.966 --> 04:24.049
Oh.

04:24.133 --> 04:25.759
He busted the locks

04:25.841 --> 04:28.216
and was squatting his slimy self
right in there.

04:29.217 --> 04:31.759
He was taking a dump
in my toilet

04:31.841 --> 04:33.300
and kicking back on the couch.

04:33.383 --> 04:35.634
Dialing himself a pizza.

04:35.717 --> 04:37.717
With the intention
of staying for good.

04:38.175 --> 04:39.717
Satan eats pizza?

04:39.800 --> 04:40.841
It's a metaphor.

04:40.925 --> 04:42.133
There I was...

04:43.883 --> 04:46.217
locked up in my cell
in Pelican Bay.

04:48.008 --> 04:49.383
In Satan's grasp.

04:52.258 --> 04:55.883
And Jesus came to me.
In a bright light.

04:55.966 --> 04:58.008
Told me to be his warrior.

04:58.092 --> 05:00.800
Now I fight for Jesus.

05:00.883 --> 05:03.425
Amen, father!
Amen!

05:03.509 --> 05:04.800
And you know
that's the winning team.

05:04.883 --> 05:06.133
We're gonna whip
Satan's ass.

05:06.217 --> 05:09.383
Oh, father, really.
Mind your words.

05:10.133 --> 05:11.883
<i>I apologize for the cussing.</i>

05:12.758 --> 05:14.966
But we will whip his ass
on that judgement day.

05:15.050 --> 05:16.175
Hey!

05:16.258 --> 05:18.717
Can I get me a refill, here?

05:21.425 --> 05:23.800
Bah-da-bing...
Bah-da-bing!

05:23.883 --> 05:26.675
Is the freaking bar closed,
or what!

05:32.050 --> 05:33.300
Yes, sir?

05:34.883 --> 05:37.092
Oh, jee...

05:38.717 --> 05:42.133
I was hoping for
that lovely lady,

05:42.217 --> 05:44.883
who brought dinner,
you know?

05:45.966 --> 05:48.008
The one who's experienced.

05:48.966 --> 05:51.008
Just the way I like it.

05:51.092 --> 05:53.133
Stewardess uniform...

05:54.175 --> 05:58.675
Well, sir,
we all have uniforms.

05:59.050 --> 06:03.800
Yeah, but hers fit just right,
just the way I like it,

06:03.883 --> 06:05.217
if you know what I mean.

06:12.050 --> 06:13.800
I guess not.

06:40.841 --> 06:42.634
What can I get you, sir?

06:45.217 --> 06:46.217
Well...

06:46.300 --> 06:51.050
If you could get Tinker Bell
to give me a refill,

06:51.133 --> 06:52.966
before he flitters
his way back up

06:53.050 --> 06:55.258
the top of that Christmas tree.

06:55.342 --> 06:56.634
Ok.

06:56.716 --> 06:58.217
One more.

06:59.300 --> 07:02.133
And then perhaps we should think
about getting some sleep?

07:04.092 --> 07:06.300
Oh, well...

07:06.716 --> 07:08.967
Blankets and some pillows and...

07:10.716 --> 07:11.925
I've heard it all before, sir.

07:12.008 --> 07:13.758
- How about if we...
- Mmm!

07:13.841 --> 07:16.384
- What if I...
- I've heard that before, too.

07:18.092 --> 07:19.217
Now...

07:19.300 --> 07:20.758
You drink your drink,

07:21.384 --> 07:25.384
and be nice, quiet little
frequent flyer,

07:25.467 --> 07:28.967
or I'll have to spank
your bottom

07:29.050 --> 07:31.675
and throw you outside
to play with the naughty boys.

07:31.758 --> 07:34.133
And it's minus thirty
outside today.

07:34.425 --> 07:35.716
Ok?

07:42.384 --> 07:44.217
Yeah, she likes me.

07:54.384 --> 07:56.217
There's something
on the radar.

08:26.342 --> 08:29.841
Daddy! I saw
a shark between the clouds!

08:30.259 --> 08:31.217
That's great!

08:32.092 --> 08:35.259
No! A real shark,
right there!

08:36.092 --> 08:37.967
How is that possible?

08:38.841 --> 08:41.841
How could a shark fly?
He clearly is a sea creature.

09:08.758 --> 09:10.050
Wait!

09:10.259 --> 09:11.384
{\an8}Several readings.

09:39.967 --> 09:40.800
Closing!

10:34.050 --> 10:35.217
Holy shit!

10:40.384 --> 10:42.342
Look into the light,
spawn of Satan!

11:52.050 --> 11:53.342
Fuck!

13:09.259 --> 13:11.633
<i>We interrupt our program
for an important message.</i>

13:11.717 --> 13:14.633
<i>News just came in
that flight NHL 234,</i>

13:14.717 --> 13:16.217

13:17.883 --> 13:19.758

13:21.800 --> 13:23.925

13:24.009 --> 13:26.717
<i>This was Jason Konrad

15:40.383 --> 15:44.092
<i>Plane recorded video footage
from passenger seat 270.</i>

15:51.884 --> 15:52.925
Yeah.

15:53.383 --> 15:54.842
It's bad.

15:55.758 --> 15:56.967
Could be a whole bunch
of things.

15:57.050 --> 15:58.758
Pilot error.
Terrorists...

15:59.216 --> 16:01.050
But this is why the Civil
Aviation Authority

16:01.133 --> 16:03.175
will take care of it,
and not our division.

16:07.133 --> 16:08.800
Recording from case 234.

16:08.884 --> 16:12.050
Present: CPT Brent Tyler

16:12.467 --> 16:14.925
<i>We took the lead 36 hours ago.</i>

16:15.009 --> 16:17.383
<i>Plane crash occurred

16:20.175 --> 16:22.300
<i>Flight NHL 234...</i>

16:22.383 --> 16:25.800
<i>was on its way from Vancouver

16:25.884 --> 16:27.717
<i>With a stopover in Iceland.</i>

16:27.800 --> 16:28.800

16:32.925 --> 16:35.842
<i>The documents reveal

16:41.717 --> 16:44.633
<i>The immediately initiated search

16:47.258 --> 16:49.009
<i>Eight bodies have been
found so far.</i>

16:49.091 --> 16:51.300
<i>Once we know more,
I'll report back.</i>

16:55.800 --> 16:58.009
You think this and the plane
attack are linked?

17:01.050 --> 17:02.884
Now I know it.

17:10.758 --> 17:12.382
You sent her to the arctic?

17:14.300 --> 17:17.133
She will be pissed.
She hates the cold.

17:17.215 --> 17:19.383
Let's hope your sister
gets there in time.

17:33.466 --> 17:35.800
<i>It's just a few kilometers
from here.</i>

17:35.884 --> 17:38.050
Our research team
is already at the site.

17:39.091 --> 17:41.050
They are currently scanning
the object.

17:47.175 --> 17:50.133
We've been busy tracking
the retreat of the glacier.

17:50.216 --> 17:52.258
Since the effects of global
warming have greatly

17:52.342 --> 17:54.717
accelerated the thawing process.

17:56.216 --> 17:58.258
Right now,
I wish it would get warmer.

18:01.717 --> 18:03.008
Look at the size
of that thing.

18:06.216 --> 18:08.800
<i>This craft looks like
some kind of warship.</i>

18:08.884 --> 18:10.717
<i>But I've never seen
a design like this.</i>

18:11.300 --> 18:12.300
Me neither.

18:13.050 --> 18:14.717
<i>That's why I called in Richter.</i>

18:15.133 --> 18:18.133
<i>That's why we've sent in an
advance party to check it out.</i>

18:18.717 --> 18:20.216
We don't know
what the hell is in there.

18:20.467 --> 18:22.300
This is out finest team.

18:22.884 --> 18:24.300
Highly motivated.

18:25.717 --> 18:27.717
Their dedication is faultless.

18:28.383 --> 18:29.966
I think they can handle this.

18:31.508 --> 18:33.717
You'll see more details
from the helmet cams.

18:33.800 --> 18:35.008
It's a live feed.

18:55.717 --> 18:57.884
That's Maynard's camera.

19:52.966 --> 19:53.800
Fuck!

19:53.883 --> 19:55.091
We need to get her
out of there.

20:00.258 --> 20:01.133
Get help.

20:03.050 --> 20:04.759
Get! Help!

21:25.342 --> 21:26.883
<i>We need help.</i>

21:26.966 --> 21:28.383
Send help now.

21:29.217 --> 21:30.300
<i>That... that seems...</i>

22:24.133 --> 22:26.008
They captured
one of the scientists.

22:26.342 --> 22:28.384
It's her camera's signal
we're watching.

22:28.800 --> 22:29.634
No.

22:29.716 --> 22:31.634
It's too late.
You can't save her!

22:31.716 --> 22:33.217
Just get the hell
out of there!

22:37.425 --> 22:38.966
She might be alive.

22:57.217 --> 22:58.800
Oh my god!

24:14.883 --> 24:15.883
<i>Did you see all that?</i>

24:16.967 --> 24:17.800
Yes.

24:17.883 --> 24:19.967
My past is finally
catching up with me.

24:20.050 --> 24:22.800
<i>But... you have to get
out of there now!</i>

24:38.092 --> 24:39.384
I'm trying.

24:42.259 --> 24:44.425
Why does she never
listen to me?

24:44.509 --> 24:46.050
What's happening there?

24:47.217 --> 24:48.925
It's worse than I feared...

27:38.008 --> 27:41.050
<i>A nation built on
the foundations of freedom.</i>

27:41.134 --> 27:43.758

<i>A population without hunger.</i>

28:02.050 --> 28:03.883
{\an8}<i>A planet without fear.</i>

28:39.217 --> 28:40.967
Never do this again,
please.

28:41.883 --> 28:43.425
I was really worried this time.

28:47.217 --> 28:48.050

28:49.009 --> 28:51.134
I've never seen anything
like this before.

28:53.050 --> 28:56.009
Did you forget to tell us
that you might know something?

28:58.425 --> 29:00.009
Don't tell me...

29:21.217 --> 29:23.383
Come on,
Diabla has to rest.

29:23.967 --> 29:25.341

That's all. Thank you.

32:47.967 --> 32:50.050
Project "Himmelsfaust"
was the brainchild

32:50.133 --> 32:53.133
of the brilliant Nazi scientist
Dr. Hans Kammler.

32:55.009 --> 32:58.009
Pioneer of genetic
mutation surgery.

32:59.425 --> 33:02.300
By 1944, the Nazis
were desperate

33:02.383 --> 33:04.216
for effective "super weapons."

33:05.300 --> 33:07.675
And Kammler thought
he had them in spades.

33:26.842 --> 33:27.925
Are you ready, Martha?

33:28.009 --> 33:30.050
Yes, General Major. Now.

33:31.175 --> 33:32.425
Esteemed...

33:34.717 --> 33:36.884
SS-Reichsführer
Heinrich Himmler.

33:37.800 --> 33:39.341
As a party comrade...

33:40.550 --> 33:41.842
I take the liberty to...

33:43.842 --> 33:45.258
sincerely propound...

33:46.009 --> 33:47.341
the following statement...

33:49.009 --> 33:52.592
regarding special building
project S3.

34:15.175 --> 34:16.632
Our engineers...

34:17.800 --> 34:19.007
were able...

34:20.842 --> 34:23.007
to successfully...

34:24.132 --> 34:25.967
execute anti-gravity tests...

34:27.007 --> 34:30.507
Anti-gravity tests?
Or test?

34:32.675 --> 34:34.090
Tests.

35:01.634 --> 35:04.884
We have to start all over.
We forgot secret project "Bell."

35:07.133 --> 35:08.342
{\an8}<i>Swing dancing forbidden</i>

35:18.258 --> 35:20.759
Doctor Kammler?
Your visitor has arrived.

35:20.842 --> 35:21.717
Tell him to wait

35:21.800 --> 35:23.508
until we have finished
our building application.

35:23.759 --> 35:24.759
Yes.

35:31.675 --> 35:32.508
Herr Reichsmarschall,

35:32.592 --> 35:34.258
please be patient
for one more minute.

35:34.342 --> 35:36.342
Doctor Kammler will soon
be ready for you.

35:36.425 --> 35:38.342
What impertinence!

35:57.342 --> 35:58.550
Hermann?

36:37.008 --> 36:38.800
My dear Kammler!

36:40.300 --> 36:41.759
You've got to help me.

36:43.759 --> 36:45.467
Good evening, dear Hermann.

36:45.550 --> 36:47.634
- Brandy?
- Double.

36:49.925 --> 36:51.383
Listen, Kammler.

36:57.091 --> 37:02.008
My whole squadron was wiped out
by British wannabe-pilots

37:02.091 --> 37:06.759
in a caitiff and dishonorable
ambush.

37:08.050 --> 37:09.883
Makes me look like
a total fool

37:09.966 --> 37:11.883
who doesn't know
where he belongs.

37:12.717 --> 37:16.050
Tell me you have a solution
to my problem!

37:23.300 --> 37:24.759
To final victory.

37:25.425 --> 37:27.925
My team has been doing research
for quite some time,

37:28.008 --> 37:30.634
aside from the dynamic
aeronautics program, on a...

37:30.717 --> 37:34.467
genetically manipulated
serum called K7B.

37:34.550 --> 37:36.592
I already know about that,
I know that.

37:36.841 --> 37:39.091
So what does it do,
this K7C?

37:39.342 --> 37:40.634
K7B.

37:40.925 --> 37:42.091
Hermann.

37:42.675 --> 37:44.008
Hermann, the bowl.

37:44.091 --> 37:45.091
Hogwash.

37:48.800 --> 37:50.258
Believe me, dear Hermann,

37:51.383 --> 37:54.759
the project I'm going
to show you now

37:56.008 --> 37:58.258
is able to turn the tide
in our favor.

37:58.342 --> 38:00.342
It will enable our ability

38:00.425 --> 38:03.050
to reconquer control
of the sky.

38:03.383 --> 38:06.883
What a venturous statement,
Kammler.

38:06.966 --> 38:10.800
I'm all ears. Impress me.

38:18.342 --> 38:19.925
I present to you:

38:20.008 --> 38:22.841
"Project Himmelsfaust."

38:34.008 --> 38:36.050
{\an8}<i>Secret Command Document</i>

38:36.550 --> 38:39.175
<i>This is the call
to the German nation!</i>

38:39.258 --> 38:42.717
<i>Everyone has his task
clearly in mind.</i>

38:43.634 --> 38:45.509
<i>Every citizen is aware
of the seriousness</i>

38:45.592 --> 38:49.133
<i>and overall situation
of our beloved Reich!</i>

38:50.383 --> 38:51.925
<i>Millions of loyal comrades</i>

38:52.008 --> 38:55.050
<i>have died a hero's death
for our country</i>

38:55.133 --> 38:58.758
<i>fighting against the enemy's
fetters.</i>

39:00.925 --> 39:03.592
<i>Until now, we have faced our
enemy's superior strength</i>

39:03.675 --> 39:06.592
<i>only with courage, honor
and determination.</i>

39:06.841 --> 39:09.092
<i>But there is hope!</i>

39:10.425 --> 39:12.217
<i>Thanks to German engineering</i>

39:12.300 --> 39:14.384
<i>and the genius of
Dr. Ing. Hans Kammler,</i>

39:14.467 --> 39:18.342
<i>we were able to develop
the retaliatory weapon K7B.</i>

39:18.675 --> 39:21.092
<i>Under the command of
Dr. Klaus Richter,</i>

39:21.175 --> 39:24.966
<i>the warfare agent is now
ready to defy the enemy!</i>

39:25.425 --> 39:27.883
<i>Applied to men,
the serum has a regenerating,</i>

39:27.966 --> 39:29.841
<i>tissue-building effect
and makes</i>

39:29.925 --> 39:32.758
<i>our brave soldiers
invulnerable.</i>

39:33.092 --> 39:36.634
<i>The research, which could not be
fully completed so far,</i>

39:36.716 --> 39:41.092
<i>prompts that K7B could prolong
a healthy person's life.</i>

39:42.133 --> 39:44.175
<i>Under his leadership,</i>

39:44.258 --> 39:47.092
<i>the 1000 Year Reich could
persist forever.</i>

39:48.592 --> 39:51.217
<i>Used on women,
the combat substance leads</i>

39:51.300 --> 39:53.966
<i>to zombification,
due to female cell structure.</i>

39:54.300 --> 39:56.883
<i>The external changes
and aggressive behavior</i>

39:56.966 --> 39:58.342
<i>seem strange,</i>

39:58.425 --> 40:00.758
<i>but Dr. Kammler sees
quite desirable,</i>

40:00.841 --> 40:02.467
<i>positive effects.</i>

40:03.092 --> 40:07.258
<i>Women become stronger,
more enduring and more decisive.</i>

40:07.342 --> 40:09.425
<i>Thus, the female
national comrade</i>

40:09.509 --> 40:11.675
<i>can also fill the ranks
of our front.</i>

40:12.133 --> 40:14.966
<i>Created in our labs,</i>

40:15.050 --> 40:17.841
<i>K7B has finally passed
its test phase</i>

40:17.925 --> 40:21.425
<i>and is now ready
to start its triumph.</i>

40:22.008 --> 40:24.092
<i>Over the battlefields
in the East,</i>

40:24.175 --> 40:27.675
<i>the dusty deserts of Africa
and renegade nations,</i>

40:27.925 --> 40:30.967
<i>the banner of victory
will be blowing soon.</i>

40:31.217 --> 40:36.384
<i>K7B will finally turn fate's
tide in our favor.</i>

40:36.925 --> 40:40.675
<i>Through the tactical use of
airplanes and sprayed as a gas,</i>

40:40.758 --> 40:43.800
<i>our dead soldiers
will become millions</i>

40:43.883 --> 40:45.883
<i>of undead super-soldiers.</i>

40:46.258 --> 40:48.050
<i>Like the phoenix
from the ashes,</i>

40:48.133 --> 40:50.550
<i>they will rise from the fields
of death</i>

40:50.633 --> 40:54.467
<i>to be reborn and serve
our German fatherland.</i>

40:54.716 --> 40:58.592
<i>Through K7B,
our nation's dead heroes</i>

40:58.675 --> 41:01.841
<i>become the shepherds
of a new era.</i>

41:01.925 --> 41:04.509
<i>Wakened by the call
of patriotism,</i>

41:04.758 --> 41:07.591
<i>Final Victory is the
preordainment.</i>

41:08.675 --> 41:13.841
<i>Indestructible and unstoppable,
one division after another</i>

41:13.925 --> 41:18.133
<i>will rise to march in rank
and file to the arm's factories.</i>

41:18.967 --> 41:22.550
<i>Each of them will board
his flying machine:</i>

41:22.883 --> 41:25.050
<i>The Reich's flying sharks.</i>

41:26.133 --> 41:28.800
<i>Combined with the
super soldiers,</i>

41:28.883 --> 41:31.300
<i>these marvels
of construction art,</i>

41:31.384 --> 41:34.133
<i>are the ultimate V-weapons.</i>

41:39.300 --> 41:41.967
<i>Equipped with jet engines,
machine guns,</i>

41:42.050 --> 41:44.425
<i>and the shark's aeronautical
concept</i>

41:44.509 --> 41:46.758
<i>they'll ascend into the sky.</i>

41:46.841 --> 41:50.050
<i>United by the iron
will to win!</i>

41:53.175 --> 41:55.300
<i>That's the order of the day.</i>

41:55.633 --> 41:59.509
<i>Now, soldier, rise up
and let the storm break loose!</i>

42:00.800 --> 42:01.841
<i>Victory!</i>

42:01.925 --> 42:04.259
<i>Research institute,
Dr. Kammler</i>

42:15.841 --> 42:18.967
Prepare a presentation
for the Führer.

42:19.050 --> 42:22.467
I can guarantee he will
be pleased.

42:24.217 --> 42:26.342
Thank you very much, Kammler.

42:26.425 --> 42:27.842
I'm in your debt.

42:28.425 --> 42:31.508
We should go hunting
once in a while.

42:32.008 --> 42:34.467
I just had a charming little
hunting lodge

42:34.550 --> 42:36.467
built in Brunswick.

42:37.508 --> 42:38.967
As soon as my research
allows it,

42:39.050 --> 42:40.883
I'll refer to your offer
with great pleasure.

42:41.217 --> 42:43.050
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.

42:44.092 --> 42:47.675
The
Himmelsfaust was the central facility.

42:47.758 --> 42:50.800
It belonged to the SS Parachute
Battalion 500.

42:50.883 --> 42:52.633
Thus it was...

42:52.716 --> 42:55.259
directly supervised
by Goering himself.

42:56.425 --> 42:58.842
That was exactly the crux
of the matter.

43:01.133 --> 43:04.300
After the Stalingrad fiasco
and in the following months,

43:04.384 --> 43:09.217
Goering realized that their
1000-year reich

43:09.300 --> 43:11.217
would not even turn
10 years old.

43:12.217 --> 43:15.050
But he saw the potential
behind Kammler's idea.

43:16.758 --> 43:19.800
So we got everything we wanted!
And we took our chances.

43:20.842 --> 43:22.883
The Horton Brothers
built the engine.

43:22.967 --> 43:25.134
Henkel took care of the
steering column construction.

43:25.217 --> 43:27.758
And the doctor and I
synthesized K7B.

43:28.550 --> 43:30.050
How could you?

43:31.800 --> 43:33.217
You have played God.

43:35.050 --> 43:36.259
No.

43:36.883 --> 43:38.217
We did not play God.

43:39.050 --> 43:40.425
We were Gods.

43:43.967 --> 43:46.134
How do you think
I got this position?

43:46.883 --> 43:50.092
And who do you think you
worked for the last 20 years?

43:51.300 --> 43:53.217
Let me summarize.

43:53.300 --> 43:56.134
Once these predators
are in the air,

43:56.217 --> 43:58.466
nothing and now one is safe.

43:59.259 --> 44:01.008
And they can play invisible!

44:01.550 --> 44:02.883
That's a disaster.

44:04.758 --> 44:08.466
So that's what's in those water
tanks at the Himmelsfaust?

44:09.384 --> 44:12.259
Genetically mutated
flying Nazi sharks?

44:12.342 --> 44:14.175
The Sky Sharks
are much more than just

44:14.259 --> 44:16.675
genetically manipulated animals.

44:16.758 --> 44:19.425
They're perfect weapon systems.

44:19.508 --> 44:21.675
They're lurking in the clouds.

44:21.758 --> 44:24.300
Watching and preying
mercilessly.

44:26.050 --> 44:30.717
There's 20 hunting sharks
model RFH 3.

44:30.800 --> 44:33.675
More couldn't spawn.
But believe me:

44:33.758 --> 44:36.717
20 of them are enough
to destroy whole cities.

45:14.675 --> 45:15.842
Secure the area!

45:20.217 --> 45:21.925
Don't you realize
the situation?

45:22.009 --> 45:24.217
Christ! The Russians
will be here soon!

45:24.300 --> 45:25.800
We have to fight!

45:29.675 --> 45:31.175
We will not!

45:31.508 --> 45:33.425
We will take your K7B

45:33.508 --> 45:37.175
and the last available
seats to Argentina!

45:37.591 --> 45:39.425
That is treason!

45:52.675 --> 45:54.383
Look around, Klaus!

45:55.675 --> 45:57.550
This is over!

45:58.758 --> 46:00.925
The Himmelsfaust
has disappeared!

46:01.009 --> 46:03.175
The experiment has failed!

46:03.717 --> 46:06.591
We will not run away!
I will not allow that!

46:06.675 --> 46:07.591
Klaus!

46:07.675 --> 46:10.050
I will never accept
that we run away!

47:15.383 --> 47:17.050
To the Fatherland!

47:51.258 --> 47:53.300
But you came to the West
after the war

47:53.383 --> 47:55.425
and worked for
the military here.

47:55.508 --> 47:57.092
How is that possible?

47:57.842 --> 47:59.717
I owe it to Paperclip!

47:59.800 --> 48:01.134
Paperclip?

48:01.842 --> 48:03.800
You were one
of the Paperclip Boys?

48:03.884 --> 48:05.717
What is Paperclip?

48:06.300 --> 48:09.800
Project Paperclip originated
from Operation Overcast.

48:09.884 --> 48:11.717
We tried to acquire
the best scientists

48:11.800 --> 48:13.425
of the German army's
research institute

48:13.508 --> 48:15.216
behind the back of our allies.

48:17.009 --> 48:19.134
<i>Jet propulsion
and rocket engineering...</i>

48:21.216 --> 48:22.383
<i>Stealth technology...</i>

48:24.425 --> 48:26.842
<i>We found ourselves in the
world's biggest toy store.</i>

48:26.925 --> 48:28.842
<i>And under no circumstances
did our forces</i>

48:28.925 --> 48:30.758
<i>want to share it
with the Russians.</i>

48:31.050 --> 48:32.717
<i>So we snatched conspicuous
Nazi scientists</i>

48:32.800 --> 48:34.341
<i>and made them our
Paperclip Boys.</i>

48:35.425 --> 48:37.967
<i>Overnight Wernher Von Braun
became America's</i>

48:38.050 --> 48:39.258
<i>greatest rocket scientist.</i>

48:39.341 --> 48:42.050
<i>Without anyone ever asking
any questions about his past.</i>

48:43.341 --> 48:45.050
<i>I told them all I knew.</i>

48:45.967 --> 48:48.425
<i>They found it hard
to believe at first.</i>

48:48.508 --> 48:50.925
<i>The scope of the
"Himmelsfaust" project.</i>

48:51.884 --> 48:54.175
<i>I told them
I'd lead them to Kammler.</i>

48:54.258 --> 48:56.383
<i>Then they'd have all the
evidence they needed.</i>

48:58.383 --> 49:02.300
<i>I'd had enough of Kammler's
special brand of madness.</i>

49:03.133 --> 49:05.717
<i>He was going to drag us
all down with him.</i>

49:06.967 --> 49:09.383
<i>I'd signed up to build
a stronger Germany.</i>

49:10.050 --> 49:11.383
<i>Not destroy it.</i>

49:14.383 --> 49:18.092
I really want
to start all over.

49:18.175 --> 49:21.216
But you have to trust me!

49:21.300 --> 49:23.759
Give us a reason
why we should.

49:25.050 --> 49:28.050
Because only I
can save the world.

49:29.258 --> 49:31.800
But more than a thousand
of us came to the US.

49:33.091 --> 49:36.133
And you just switched sides.
Just like that?

49:39.175 --> 49:41.175
All is fair in love and war.

49:52.884 --> 49:54.133
And then...

49:54.216 --> 49:57.133
You just stopped,
founded a family and...

49:57.216 --> 49:58.884
played Mr. Nice Guy?

50:00.759 --> 50:03.175
How are we supposed
to ever trust you again?

50:03.258 --> 50:05.717
After you lied to us
all these years?

50:12.216 --> 50:13.800
<i>Hello, this is
Natalie Rochefort</i>

50:13.884 --> 50:15.759
<i>from MTP news.</i>

50:16.050 --> 50:17.967
We've gotten word
of several terrorist attacks

50:18.050 --> 50:19.800
taking place throughout Europe.

50:19.884 --> 50:21.717
It seems London
is under attack.

50:22.467 --> 50:24.425
Several... Sky Sharks!

50:24.967 --> 50:26.050
Oh my god!

50:26.133 --> 50:28.050
They're tearing people apart!

50:31.842 --> 50:34.884
{\an8}<i>I'm standing here
on the burning rooftops of Barcelona.</i>

50:35.258 --> 50:37.467
{\an8}<i>The horrifying scenes
have moved thousands.</i>

50:37.550 --> 50:40.884
{\an8}<i>People flee in terror.
The outer roads are crowded.</i>

51:14.967 --> 51:16.258
What have you done?

51:23.133 --> 51:24.717
How much time do we have?

51:25.216 --> 51:26.717
A week, max.

51:28.342 --> 51:30.383
I'll call a NSC War Council
meeting.

51:31.425 --> 51:32.884
Time to strike back.

51:32.966 --> 51:34.800
<i>Security level 7.</i>

51:37.050 --> 51:38.925
<i>Authorization granted.</i>

51:41.966 --> 51:43.383
Angelique, I need you
to get me the head

51:43.467 --> 51:45.091
of the German Intelligence.

51:45.175 --> 51:49.800
<i>And see... if you can reach
our French friend Colbert.</i>

51:50.050 --> 51:51.091
And we need the...

51:51.175 --> 51:54.383
the Japanese shark expert,
Dr. Katsube.

51:55.091 --> 51:59.300
But we can't do without that
weird CIA guy Martin Keele.

51:59.383 --> 52:01.966
He might be in Venezuela
for all I know.

52:02.050 --> 52:04.383
But... we need... oh...

52:06.550 --> 52:08.925
That fucking arrogant guy
from London.

52:09.008 --> 52:10.175
Whatever his name is.

52:10.258 --> 52:13.008
And my friend Frost of course.

52:13.216 --> 52:14.925
<i>Sorry.
I'm a little late.</i>

52:15.008 --> 52:16.133
<i>Gentlemen.</i>

52:16.216 --> 52:17.800
Ladies.

52:17.884 --> 52:19.175
Hello, Klaus.

52:19.508 --> 52:20.966
How are things?

52:21.966 --> 52:23.216
No bad, Mitch, not bad.

52:23.300 --> 52:24.800
How's Marjorie?

52:24.884 --> 52:25.925
Oh, fine.

52:26.008 --> 52:28.800
You know, she still makes
the worst corn bread ever.

52:30.008 --> 52:33.175
My research indicated
that the Himmelsfaust Project

52:33.258 --> 52:34.175
was destroyed.

52:34.258 --> 52:35.425
Program neutralized.

52:37.342 --> 52:38.425
But I was wrong.

52:39.550 --> 52:43.050
What I'm sad to say, I helped
to create 70 years ago,

52:43.133 --> 52:44.759
has been dormant.

52:45.342 --> 52:47.300
Waiting for the opportunity
to strike.

52:47.383 --> 52:50.383
Well, no use crying over spilt
milk, Dr. Richter.

52:52.008 --> 52:54.717
I mean, that is, if you can call
400 airline passengers

52:54.800 --> 52:57.342
chopped up like beef jerky
in a span of 24 hours,

52:57.425 --> 52:58.550
"spilt milk."

52:58.634 --> 53:02.050
The reality is, we have to
destroy these abominations.

53:02.508 --> 53:04.467
Or no aircraft
in the air is safe.

53:04.550 --> 53:06.008
Gentlemen!

53:06.091 --> 53:07.133
Dr. Richter!

53:07.217 --> 53:08.883
These are sharks?

53:08.966 --> 53:11.217
But they can fly,
you say?

53:11.425 --> 53:12.383
Yes.

53:12.467 --> 53:14.133
They've been frozen
in the ice of the Arctic.

53:14.217 --> 53:16.800
Look, this is a clear and
present threat, senator.

53:17.008 --> 53:20.842
We have an elite commando
in the French air force.

53:22.050 --> 53:24.008
We will make them available.

53:25.050 --> 53:26.300
I will arrange it.

53:26.383 --> 53:27.300
Yeah?

53:27.383 --> 53:30.133
Oh, we happen to have
one or two good pilots

53:30.217 --> 53:32.175
in the US Air Force too,
my friend.

53:32.258 --> 53:34.717
Pah!
Your Top Guns?

53:35.383 --> 53:37.966
Our French Elite
can out fly them!

53:38.050 --> 53:39.133
Yeah?

53:39.217 --> 53:40.841
Don't forget.

53:40.925 --> 53:42.966
If you ever want to get in
a pissing contest,

53:43.050 --> 53:44.925
anytime, Colbert!

53:46.175 --> 53:49.966
I can send a couple of my
carriers down the river Seine

53:50.050 --> 53:53.175
and blow some wind up your
skirt, my French friend.

53:53.759 --> 53:55.425
But if the Sky Sharks
can re-establish

53:55.509 --> 53:56.634
their breeding program

53:56.717 --> 53:59.383
who knows how many of these
things could be unleashed.

53:59.883 --> 54:01.925
What? There's more of these
things in the pipeline?

54:02.008 --> 54:04.467
They have a breeding program?

54:05.925 --> 54:07.258
So how many of these
things are there, huh?

54:07.342 --> 54:09.717
A squadron?
A flock? What?

54:09.925 --> 54:10.883
It's inevitable.

54:11.759 --> 54:13.883
This is how the project
was conceived.

54:13.966 --> 54:15.258
World domination!

54:15.342 --> 54:16.175
You sure did a great job

54:16.258 --> 54:18.467
when you cooked up this one,
Dr. Richter.

54:19.342 --> 54:21.425
Jesus, talk about
a ticking time bomb.

54:21.509 --> 54:24.133
It's like a goddamned
Nazi reunion tour.

54:24.217 --> 54:28.091
"Well, you missed in 1945?
Guess what? We're back?"

54:28.175 --> 54:29.258
Believe me,

54:30.883 --> 54:32.883
no one regrets this
more than me.

54:33.258 --> 54:36.717
If they mutate,
which they most likely will,

54:36.800 --> 54:39.133
They won't be as easy to hunt
as regular sharks.

54:39.217 --> 54:41.425
Dr. Katsube has studied
the data.

54:41.509 --> 54:43.342
She thinks there could
be a solution.

54:54.383 --> 54:58.133
Yes. From the initial data,
it seems the Sky Sharks

54:58.217 --> 55:01.300
have developed a form of
genetic stealth camouflage.

55:01.383 --> 55:02.258
What?!

55:02.342 --> 55:04.717
It's that...
if you can't see the target,

55:06.008 --> 55:09.300
doesn't matter
how many missiles you have.

55:11.258 --> 55:13.467
Their cloaking defense
will make this difficult.

55:13.550 --> 55:17.175
Exactly. More research.

55:17.258 --> 55:20.966
I feel we should
appoint a subcommittee

55:21.050 --> 55:23.300
to report on this evidence.

55:34.383 --> 55:36.883
By inverting the natural
sonar sensing glands

55:36.966 --> 55:39.384
in the Sky Sharks skin,

55:39.467 --> 55:42.841
they're able to deflect
standard radar pulses.

55:44.883 --> 55:47.925
The Sky Sharks sonar
impulses can be disrupted

55:48.008 --> 55:49.716
with a counter sonar signal.

55:49.966 --> 55:53.092
This will render the Sky Sharks'
invisibility cloak defective.

55:53.175 --> 55:55.050
Do we have equipment
to do this?

55:55.841 --> 55:57.966
If we can get a military
transport close enough

55:58.050 --> 56:00.300
with a device that emits
a sonar pulse,

56:00.384 --> 56:01.966
then we have a shot.

56:03.925 --> 56:07.008
The UK needs to take
a leading role in this action.

56:07.800 --> 56:09.925
Military action is not cheap.

56:10.008 --> 56:12.467
We have to consider
the Federal budget.

56:12.550 --> 56:16.133
The time for talk
and bullshit is over?

56:16.883 --> 56:19.467
We will have to get
the president

56:19.550 --> 56:21.883
and Congress to approve this.

56:22.217 --> 56:26.384
We have to get all civilian
traffic out of the sky.

56:26.467 --> 56:30.092
We need to create
a no-fly zone.

56:30.758 --> 56:32.883
Put the skies under martial law.

56:32.966 --> 56:34.883
It's the only way
that we can be safe.

56:34.966 --> 56:36.342
Make sure its implemented.

56:36.425 --> 56:37.800
Dr. Richter,

56:37.883 --> 56:39.925
continue to work
on the solution.

56:41.300 --> 56:44.008
Senator, Richter's team
are right.

56:44.092 --> 56:45.425
We have to strike fast.

56:45.509 --> 56:47.050
You got your orders ratified!

56:47.133 --> 56:48.300
Get to work!

56:48.384 --> 56:50.758
Hit these freaks
with our sonar!

56:50.841 --> 56:52.467
And then our fighters
can blow them apart!

56:52.550 --> 56:54.800
I wanna see them dropping
to the ground

56:54.883 --> 56:56.883
like hooker's panties
at Mardi Gras!

56:58.133 --> 56:59.925
What he's saying is
fuck Congress,

57:00.008 --> 57:02.217
fuck the president
and let's just do it.

57:03.217 --> 57:05.384
Man, I love living in
a democracy.

57:15.342 --> 57:17.841
Hello, this is Harold Everton
from the New York City News

57:17.925 --> 57:19.384
with a special report.

57:20.175 --> 57:22.342
I'm in front of the New York
financial headquarters

57:22.425 --> 57:24.092
right now.

57:25.384 --> 57:27.967
The worldwide no-fly zone
is a disaster.

57:28.050 --> 57:30.133
Our economy is on the brink
of financial collapse.

57:30.217 --> 57:32.925
And Wall Street has not
opened today.

57:33.384 --> 57:36.008
Is this another Friday
the 13th?

57:37.258 --> 57:39.384
Can the government really
keep us here in the country?

57:39.467 --> 57:40.300
It appears so.

57:40.384 --> 57:42.384
All flights are cancelled
nation wide.

57:42.467 --> 57:45.300
And nobody can leave America.

57:45.384 --> 57:46.425
What's going on?

57:46.509 --> 57:47.633
Why are they holding us here?

57:47.716 --> 57:51.384
How long will the continue
and are we under martial law?

57:52.300 --> 57:53.967
The President needs
to give us answers.

57:54.050 --> 57:55.175
Please God help us!

57:55.259 --> 57:57.883
And save our great country.

57:59.133 --> 58:01.841
I'm Harold Everton
in New York City signing out.

58:01.925 --> 58:03.217
Back to the studio.

58:26.467 --> 58:27.800
<i>All flights are cancelled.</i>

58:27.883 --> 58:30.217
<i>I repeat,
all flights are cancelled.</i>

58:30.841 --> 58:32.300
<i>All flights are cancelled.</i>

58:32.384 --> 58:35.300
<i>I repeat,
all flights are cancelled.</i>

58:46.050 --> 58:47.384
KAI.

58:47.883 --> 58:50.425
Please stop playing
with this stupid ball,

58:50.509 --> 58:52.467
for God's sake.

58:56.384 --> 58:58.300
Where do these flying sharks
come from?

58:58.384 --> 59:00.342
Who are these strange men
riding them?

59:00.425 --> 59:01.467
But most of all,
what is their goa...?

59:17.842 --> 59:18.883
<i>Hello, Tyler.</i>

59:18.967 --> 59:20.467
<i>We have the sonar
impulse ready.</i>

59:21.800 --> 59:23.050
<i>Yes, we did it.</i>

59:27.050 --> 59:29.800
<i>You will now receive a suitcase
with the antidote.</i>

59:33.092 --> 59:34.925
And you know
what do do with it.

59:38.217 --> 59:39.384
<i>Ugh.</i>

59:39.967 --> 59:42.217
<i>Now the Eiffel Tower is gone,
too!</i>

59:44.175 --> 59:46.716
<i>I just want to get out of here.
Damn. Shit.</i>

59:46.800 --> 59:48.134
I'm quite with you.

59:49.008 --> 59:51.342
For 5 days I've been
crouching here.

59:51.425 --> 59:53.259
Witnessing how Europe
is transformed

59:53.342 --> 59:55.384
into something uglier
than it's been already.

59:56.967 --> 59:59.300
This no-fly zone
needs to be lifted.

59:59.384 --> 01:00:03.217
Then off, across the pond,
and welcome back USA.

01:00:04.342 --> 01:00:06.342
What happens if
they attack us?

01:00:09.008 --> 01:00:12.300
I'm the best Air Marshal
between Paris and New York.

01:00:12.384 --> 01:00:15.925
No flying fish stands between me
and my passengers.

01:00:35.384 --> 01:00:38.175
Never thought I'd go hunting
sharks in a plane.

01:00:40.550 --> 01:00:41.425
You okay?

01:00:41.508 --> 01:00:42.883
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:00:46.425 --> 01:00:47.466
You sick or something?

01:00:47.550 --> 01:00:50.050
We can get one of Tyler's medics
to give you a shot.

01:00:50.134 --> 01:00:51.134
No!

01:00:52.217 --> 01:00:55.466
No. I'll be fine.
It's just some stupid flu bug.

01:00:56.466 --> 01:00:57.466
Okay...

01:00:57.550 --> 01:00:59.092
If you say so.

01:01:01.925 --> 01:01:03.217
Let's go.

01:01:27.342 --> 01:01:29.383
I never thought
I would see you again,

01:01:30.134 --> 01:01:31.883
after the mess you left for me.

01:01:35.425 --> 01:01:36.717
Come here.

01:01:37.175 --> 01:01:38.758
- Good to see you.
- Oh, yeah.

01:01:41.342 --> 01:01:42.383
You must be Angelique.

01:01:49.508 --> 01:01:50.717
Hey. Hey.

01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:51.633
What?

01:01:51.717 --> 01:01:53.383
- Look at this.
- What...?

01:01:53.466 --> 01:01:55.134
Our flight is cleared.

01:01:55.217 --> 01:01:56.842
- What? Where?
- There.

01:01:58.383 --> 01:01:59.883
You're right.

01:02:02.217 --> 01:02:03.800
<i>We're going home!</i>

01:02:05.925 --> 01:02:07.967
<i>When energy
becomes a weapon...</i>

01:02:08.050 --> 01:02:10.425
<i>When the last remaining
oil reserves</i>

01:02:10.508 --> 01:02:13.050
<i>rest in the hands
of fanatics...</i>

01:02:13.134 --> 01:02:16.134
<i>If our idea of freedom
is threatened,</i>

01:02:16.217 --> 01:02:18.009
<i>we must act!</i>

01:02:18.259 --> 01:02:21.842
<i>War and terrorism must never
be tolerated again.</i>

01:02:21.925 --> 01:02:23.967
<i>Setting out your challenge!</i>

01:02:24.050 --> 01:02:27.009
<i>Fighting at the
Dead Flesh Forces.</i>

01:02:27.092 --> 01:02:29.466
<i>Whoever occupies foreign
countries nowadays</i>

01:02:29.550 --> 01:02:32.092
<i>no longer needs to be ashamed.</i>

01:02:32.175 --> 01:02:35.967
<i>On today's battlefield
no one has to die.</i>

01:02:36.883 --> 01:02:39.842
<i>Your avatar,
your willingness to trade</i>

01:02:39.925 --> 01:02:43.341
<i>and our knowledge ensures
the safety of your family.</i>

01:02:43.425 --> 01:02:45.300
<i>The Dead Flesh Forces.</i>

01:02:45.383 --> 01:02:47.758
<i>Our sword of justice.</i>

01:02:47.842 --> 01:02:50.175
<i>We stand between good
and evil.</i>

01:02:50.259 --> 01:02:54.217
<i>Where in justice becomes law,
resistance becomes a duty.</i>

01:02:55.175 --> 01:02:57.800
<i>We are Richter Technology.</i>

01:02:57.883 --> 01:03:00.341
<i>And our future is today.</i>

01:03:04.050 --> 01:03:06.883
<i>This is the final call
for NY 7887.</i>

01:03:07.050 --> 01:03:09.466
<i>Boarding is already in progress
at gate 84.</i>

01:03:09.550 --> 01:03:14.300
<i>Repeat. All passengers
for flight NY 7887</i>

01:03:14.383 --> 01:03:16.300
<i>from Nice to New York
are requested</i>

01:03:16.383 --> 01:03:18.258
<i>to immediately proceed
to Gate 84.</i>

01:03:20.550 --> 01:03:21.383
Alright.

01:03:22.383 --> 01:03:23.800
Strange.

01:03:23.883 --> 01:03:25.466
My office tells me
that all Americans

01:03:25.550 --> 01:03:26.967
are allowed to fly out.

01:03:28.883 --> 01:03:30.967
But I only see
our small group.

01:03:31.050 --> 01:03:32.842
I couldn't care less.

01:03:32.925 --> 01:03:35.092
The important thing
is I am getting out.

01:03:56.050 --> 01:03:57.258
<i>Stealth Mode</i>

01:04:16.550 --> 01:04:17.800
Green light!

01:04:17.884 --> 01:04:20.508
Launch the attack
on that Nazi carrier!

01:04:40.175 --> 01:04:41.383
<i>Here's your captain speaking.</i>

01:04:41.466 --> 01:04:43.216
<i>The vessel will arrive in a bit</i>

01:04:43.300 --> 01:04:45.050
<i>ECA 73</i>

01:04:45.216 --> 01:04:47.383
<i>1100, expect some turbulences.</i>

01:04:48.383 --> 01:04:50.050
<i>Switch your body cameras on.</i>

01:04:55.383 --> 01:04:56.383
<i>Oh, Jasmine.</i>

01:04:56.466 --> 01:04:57.341
I don't know why you bother.

01:04:57.425 --> 01:04:59.550
You're pretty enough
for that mess out there.

01:04:59.633 --> 01:05:01.134
It's a part of our job.

01:05:01.925 --> 01:05:02.884
You'll learn.

01:05:16.050 --> 01:05:17.425
Excuse me, stewardess.

01:05:18.383 --> 01:05:20.467
The stupid plane
is going really slow.

01:05:20.550 --> 01:05:22.884
Can't you tell that...
that pilot of yours

01:05:22.967 --> 01:05:24.341
to speed it up a bit?

01:05:24.550 --> 01:05:26.884
I really gotta be somewhere.

01:05:26.967 --> 01:05:29.175
Hmm. Don't we all?

01:05:29.258 --> 01:05:30.175
You know what?

01:05:30.258 --> 01:05:32.175
Why don't I ask the captain

01:05:32.258 --> 01:05:34.258
if we can throw out some
of the more pesky passengers

01:05:34.341 --> 01:05:35.175
from the economy class.

01:05:35.258 --> 01:05:37.425
I did see some fatties
back there.

01:05:37.508 --> 01:05:38.967
Oh, you might wanna
spare the kids.

01:05:39.050 --> 01:05:39.925
What do you think?

01:05:41.216 --> 01:05:43.175
This will have consequences.

01:05:44.050 --> 01:05:45.133
Okay.

01:05:53.383 --> 01:05:54.800
What kind of game is this?

01:05:54.884 --> 01:05:55.884
Let me see.

01:05:56.842 --> 01:05:58.800
This is the coolest game
in the world.

01:05:58.884 --> 01:06:00.967
Does the female lead
at least get clothes

01:06:01.050 --> 01:06:02.884
when you reach the next level?

01:06:06.133 --> 01:06:07.383
Enjoy.

01:06:16.383 --> 01:06:17.592
<i>Ladies and gentlemen.</i>

01:06:17.675 --> 01:06:21.091
<i>This is your captain speaking
with a short status update.</i>

01:06:21.175 --> 01:06:23.258
<i>We have just passed
Faröer Islands</i>

01:06:23.341 --> 01:06:26.925
<i>and will be committed to the
care of American Air Monitoring</i>

01:06:27.009 --> 01:06:28.258
<i>in about an hour.</i>

01:06:28.341 --> 01:06:30.842
<i>In another 3 1/2 hours
we will be landing</i>

01:06:30.925 --> 01:06:32.425
<i>at JFK airport.</i>

01:06:32.508 --> 01:06:34.383
<i>So enjoy your flight.</i>

01:06:43.341 --> 01:06:44.842
What did you expect?

01:06:45.216 --> 01:06:47.133
They just visited Europe.

01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:50.009
They should be happy
we could leave it behind.

01:06:50.091 --> 01:06:51.425
You're damn right.

01:07:13.050 --> 01:07:14.258
You all right?

01:07:16.050 --> 01:07:17.425
Some headache.

01:07:48.884 --> 01:07:49.842
Guys!

01:07:49.925 --> 01:07:52.467
There's fucking something
outside the plane!

01:07:52.550 --> 01:07:53.550
- What?!
- What?

01:08:04.884 --> 01:08:06.884
Everybody calm down!

01:08:10.050 --> 01:08:11.300
I'll be right back!

01:09:23.506 --> 01:09:25.133
Oh, fuck!

01:09:40.216 --> 01:09:42.008
Fuck...

01:11:09.342 --> 01:11:10.800
<i>05/01.</i>

01:11:10.883 --> 01:11:12.883
<i>We're approaching object
in 40 seconds.</i>

01:11:49.300 --> 01:11:50.342
Multiple readings

01:11:50.841 --> 01:11:52.050
<i>Approaching target.</i>

01:11:52.217 --> 01:11:53.467
Prepare the pulse device!

01:11:54.550 --> 01:11:56.175
<i>Get ready for pulse device.</i>

01:11:56.258 --> 01:11:57.800
<i>I'm ready to shoot.</i>

01:11:57.883 --> 01:11:59.425
- Get ready, boys!
- <i>Yeah!</i>

01:12:00.092 --> 01:12:01.133
Do it.

01:12:01.592 --> 01:12:03.008
Fire pulse!

01:12:31.133 --> 01:12:32.841
Thank you.
We made it.

01:12:37.300 --> 01:12:39.384
They're genetically mutating
to defend themselves!

01:12:39.467 --> 01:12:40.841
Shit!

01:12:43.175 --> 01:12:44.300
Ok...

01:12:44.384 --> 01:12:46.300
Listen, we better
close in now.

01:12:46.384 --> 01:12:47.467
Your father had a premonition

01:12:47.550 --> 01:12:49.342
that something like this
might happen.

01:12:49.425 --> 01:12:50.883
He gave me this.

01:12:52.217 --> 01:12:54.050
The K7B connects all together.

01:12:54.883 --> 01:12:56.300
This is the antidote
that keeps your sister

01:12:56.384 --> 01:12:58.050
from falling pray to evil.

01:12:59.008 --> 01:13:01.258
If she turns,
you give her a fucking shot.

01:13:38.133 --> 01:13:39.217
Hi, Dad.

01:13:39.883 --> 01:13:41.550
We're in a pretty bad
situation in here.

01:13:42.050 --> 01:13:44.800
Do you know what's going
to happen here tonight,

01:13:44.883 --> 01:13:46.217
never was my intention.

01:13:46.300 --> 01:13:47.758
You have to believe me.

01:13:49.300 --> 01:13:50.467
Could it get any worse?

01:13:50.550 --> 01:13:53.258
We were using innocent people
as live bait.

01:13:54.050 --> 01:13:58.133
I swear, I'll retire from
everything once this is over.

01:13:59.092 --> 01:14:00.342
Anyway...

01:14:01.883 --> 01:14:02.967
How is Diabla?

01:14:04.300 --> 01:14:06.467
She claims it is a flu,
but we both know better.

01:14:07.384 --> 01:14:08.217
Listen...

01:14:08.300 --> 01:14:10.925
There's one thing
you need to understand.

01:14:12.467 --> 01:14:14.467
Everything is connected
with everything.

01:14:14.550 --> 01:14:17.925
They can feel Diabla's presence
and they want her.

01:14:19.342 --> 01:14:21.175
Are you out of your mind?

01:14:21.259 --> 01:14:23.384
Are we really just
guinea pigs to you?

01:14:23.841 --> 01:14:27.008
No no no. Don't worry.
They won't harm her.

01:14:27.259 --> 01:14:29.300
They see her
as one of their own.

01:14:29.384 --> 01:14:30.800
But...

01:14:30.883 --> 01:14:32.925
Just look after her,
will you?

01:14:33.841 --> 01:14:35.425
Is that the reason
why I am here alone?

01:14:35.967 --> 01:14:37.841
No, you're not alone.

01:14:38.217 --> 01:14:40.883
But I'm too old
for the battlefield.

01:14:42.175 --> 01:14:43.967
I can be of more help
from here.

01:15:31.092 --> 01:15:34.217
A US Navy patrol ship
sent this shot 30 minutes ago.

01:15:35.425 --> 01:15:36.841
The pulse didn't work.

01:15:36.925 --> 01:15:38.467
The Sky Sharks are stronger.

01:15:38.550 --> 01:15:41.342
They keep mutating
to defend themselves.

01:15:41.425 --> 01:15:43.509
I believe the Himmelsfaust
and the Sky Sharks

01:15:43.591 --> 01:15:44.967
may be heading here.

01:15:45.050 --> 01:15:45.967
To New York.

01:15:46.050 --> 01:15:48.925
What do they want
on the Eastern Seaboard?

01:15:49.550 --> 01:15:52.259
I've got a daughter
going to Columbia College.

01:15:54.217 --> 01:15:55.883
Why are they coming near land?

01:15:57.550 --> 01:15:59.508
I believe they want to kill
their maker.

01:16:00.925 --> 01:16:03.425
I'm the only one who
can create an antidote

01:16:03.508 --> 01:16:04.633
and reverse their programming.

01:16:05.342 --> 01:16:09.133
They must know I've been working
on a way to neutralize them.

01:16:10.133 --> 01:16:11.300
Mein Gott!

01:16:11.384 --> 01:16:13.300
They will destroy New York.

01:16:13.967 --> 01:16:15.384
This...

01:16:15.467 --> 01:16:16.842
Is why...

01:16:16.925 --> 01:16:19.133
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:16:21.092 --> 01:16:24.217
the only option left is to let
the genie out of the bottle

01:16:26.092 --> 01:16:28.175
Project Dead Flesh.

01:16:32.175 --> 01:16:34.134
Project Dead Flesh...

01:16:36.050 --> 01:16:38.259
May God have mercy.

01:16:39.550 --> 01:16:41.259
I thought that was just some
story they told

01:16:41.342 --> 01:16:42.800
in the corporation.

01:16:42.883 --> 01:16:44.967
Like something for the agents
to tell their kids

01:16:45.050 --> 01:16:46.508
at night to scare them.

01:16:48.925 --> 01:16:52.050
So you're telling me there
really is a project Dead Flesh?

01:16:52.842 --> 01:16:55.050
What is project Dead Flesh?

01:16:56.134 --> 01:17:00.217
<i>Well it all started with the
US losing in Korea and Vietnam.</i>

01:17:02.384 --> 01:17:04.800
<i>I had to come over in '46
from Germany</i>

01:17:04.883 --> 01:17:07.050
<i>with the help
of Project Paperclip.</i>

01:17:08.466 --> 01:17:10.466
<i>For a few years I was
nothing but a sidekick</i>

01:17:10.550 --> 01:17:11.591
<i>to the US generals.</i>

01:17:11.675 --> 01:17:15.800
<i>But in March '68,
after the massacre of My Lai,</i>

01:17:15.883 --> 01:17:17.217
<i>I came into the picture.</i>

01:17:18.217 --> 01:17:21.092
<i>That's when Project Dead Flesh
was born.</i>

01:17:24.008 --> 01:17:28.134
<i>All of a sudden I got all the
funding and support I asked for</i>

01:17:28.217 --> 01:17:30.384
<i>and nobody was asking
any questions.</i>

01:17:31.175 --> 01:17:34.092
<i>My team and I moved the lab
over to Fort Hammerhead</i>

01:17:34.175 --> 01:17:35.384
<i>at Da Nang border.</i>

01:17:38.883 --> 01:17:42.967
<i>Project Dead Flesh was about
creating the perfect soldier.</i>

01:17:43.050 --> 01:17:46.342
<i>Resilient, indestructible
and unstoppable.</i>

01:17:47.217 --> 01:17:48.800
<i>We called him Damian.</i>

01:17:49.591 --> 01:17:52.134
<i>My team implanted
a neuro-receiver</i>

01:17:52.217 --> 01:17:54.508
<i>into the brains
of fallen soldiers</i>

01:17:54.883 --> 01:17:56.217
<i>so we could control them.</i>

01:17:57.050 --> 01:17:59.383
<i>Microwaves in the lower
beta-range allowed</i>

01:17:59.466 --> 01:18:02.425
<i>to send impulses
from one brain to another.</i>

01:18:03.342 --> 01:18:06.800
<i>I wanted full control
over my super-soldier.</i>

01:18:07.925 --> 01:18:10.425
<i>My technology had always
worked in the lab.</i>

01:18:10.508 --> 01:18:13.383
<i>But now we had a chance
to test it in the field.</i>

01:18:14.633 --> 01:18:17.008
<i>We got permission to use
an imprisoned Charlie-unit</i>

01:18:17.092 --> 01:18:18.217
<i>as guinea pigs.</i>

01:18:18.883 --> 01:18:22.425
<i>My special unit
infected them with K7B</i>

01:18:22.508 --> 01:18:25.967
<i>and my team and I
documented their morphing</i>

01:18:26.050 --> 01:18:28.883
<i>into blood-thirsty
Vietcong zombies</i>

01:18:28.967 --> 01:18:31.842
<i>who were supposed to attack
camp Hammerhead.</i>

01:18:33.883 --> 01:18:38.259
<i>We knew the US unit would lose
against Charlie's army of dead,</i>

01:18:38.341 --> 01:18:40.883
<i>but we had an ace
up our sleeve.</i>

01:18:41.508 --> 01:18:44.466
<i>We flew in
my super-soldier Damian,</i>

01:18:44.550 --> 01:18:48.300
<i>a Green Beret trained to operat
behind the enemy lines.</i>

01:18:48.967 --> 01:18:52.259
<i>What other called "Hell",
he called his "Home."</i>

01:18:54.508 --> 01:18:57.300
<i>He was in action
from '67 to '69</i>

01:18:57.383 --> 01:19:00.341
<i>until a bullet killed him
in the field.</i>

01:19:01.175 --> 01:19:05.383
<i>His body responded to K7B
in an unprecedented way.</i>

01:19:08.550 --> 01:19:10.466
<i>The good soldiers
from Camp Hammerhead</i>

01:19:10.550 --> 01:19:13.009
<i>had just come back
from a regular mission</i>

01:19:13.092 --> 01:19:15.425
<i>and did not know
what was coming at them.</i>

01:19:16.092 --> 01:19:18.050
<i>They expected to have
a quiet night</i>

01:19:18.134 --> 01:19:20.259
<i>and some good rest
after a few drinks.</i>

01:19:22.550 --> 01:19:24.466
<i>Damian was in sleep mode.</i>

01:19:24.883 --> 01:19:26.050
<i>We connected his brain</i>

01:19:26.134 --> 01:19:28.466
<i>to that of my assistant,
Dr. Greene,</i>

01:19:28.550 --> 01:19:31.550
<i>in order to control
his thoughts and movement.</i>

01:19:32.550 --> 01:19:33.842
<i>We woke Damian up</i>

01:19:33.925 --> 01:19:36.050
<i>and got him ready
for his mission.</i>

01:20:00.175 --> 01:20:02.217
Everything exactly as planned.

01:20:03.300 --> 01:20:04.800
Open the gates.

01:21:42.175 --> 01:21:45.050
<i>The Vietcong zombies attacked
camp Hammerhead.</i>

01:21:45.383 --> 01:21:46.383
<i>All hell broke loose</i>

01:21:46.466 --> 01:21:50.009
<i>and Dr. Greene started
to remote-control Damian</i>

01:21:50.092 --> 01:21:51.550
<i>through the wire connection.</i>

01:21:52.258 --> 01:21:55.300
<i>Everything unfolded
precisely as planned.</i>

01:22:01.009 --> 01:22:02.550
<i>It was a full success.</i>

01:22:03.092 --> 01:22:04.925
<i>Damian was unstoppable.</i>

01:22:08.425 --> 01:22:10.383
<i>But there was one flaw.</i>

01:22:11.050 --> 01:22:12.300
<i>Dr. Greene.</i>

01:22:13.550 --> 01:22:15.967
<i>Unfortunately the secreted
adrenaline in Greene's blood</i>

01:22:16.050 --> 01:22:18.175
<i>circulation disturbed
the transmission.</i>

01:22:18.258 --> 01:22:21.092
<i>First he got cramps,
then he twitched.</i>

01:22:22.550 --> 01:22:24.550
<i>Damian tore the receiver
from his head</i>

01:22:24.633 --> 01:22:27.383
<i>and fell into an unprecedented
blood lust.</i>

01:22:28.092 --> 01:22:29.216
<i>We lost control.</i>

01:22:30.383 --> 01:22:33.800
<i>He was unable to distinguish
between friend or foe.</i>

01:22:36.383 --> 01:22:37.550
<i>The experiment failed.</i>

01:22:40.092 --> 01:22:42.258
<i>I stood there,
could only watch,</i>

01:22:43.258 --> 01:22:45.508
<i>could only wait until
the smoke had cleared.</i>

01:22:47.258 --> 01:22:50.425
<i>Until the K7B
was broken down in Damian.</i>

01:22:51.550 --> 01:22:53.175
<i>Considering it was a disaster,</i>

01:22:53.258 --> 01:22:55.884
<i>still something amazing
came out of it.</i>

01:22:57.300 --> 01:22:59.467
<i>I had finally found the error
in the system.</i>

01:23:01.133 --> 01:23:03.216
<i>You can't break
a dead person's will!</i>

01:23:04.383 --> 01:23:08.467
