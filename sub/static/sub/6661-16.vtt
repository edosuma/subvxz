19:35.845 --> 19:37.176
SAM...

19:37.176 --> 19:39.409
I HAVE TO
BREAK UP WITH YOU.

19:39.409 --> 19:40.710
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

19:40.710 --> 19:43.713
JUST I CARE
ABOUT YOU SO MUCH.

19:43.713 --> 19:45.285
IT'S NOT YOU, SAM.
I-IT'S ME.

19:45.285 --> 19:46.886
NO, IT'S NOT, ANDI.
IT'S GREG.

19:46.886 --> 19:49.419
HE SOLD HIS SOUL
TO THE DEVIL.

19:49.419 --> 19:52.822
WHAT? NO, THAT'S--
THAT'S CRAZY.

19:52.822 --> 19:54.624
I KNOW, GREG.
I TALKED TO HIM, OK?

19:54.624 --> 19:56.396
ONLY A JERK
LIKE YOU WOULD MAKE
A DEAL WITH HIM.

19:56.396 --> 19:58.928
HE'S GOT SOME WEIRD
MIND-CONTROL THING
OVER YOU.

19:58.928 --> 20:01.501
HE'S MAKING YOU
LIKE HIM.

20:02.232 --> 20:03.973
IS THIS TRUE?

20:06.736 --> 20:08.408
IT DOESN'T MATTER, ANDI.

20:08.408 --> 20:11.241
ALL YOU CARE ABOUT
IS ME.

20:40.440 --> 20:42.572
THAT'S HOW HE'S MAKING
ANDI GO OUT WITH HIM.

20:42.572 --> 20:44.944
WOW. WHO KNEW?

I DON'T CARE WHAT YOUR
STUPID CLIPBOARD SAYS, OK?

21:15.905 --> 21:18.348

21:43.433 --> 21:45.835
OK, NOW, BY "CAT,"
DO YOU MEAN CAT,

A GUY WHO MIGHT
BE ABLE TO HELP.

22:02.352 --> 22:04.394

22:04.394 --> 22:05.955
THIS IS A PORTAL TO HELL.

22:05.955 --> 22:07.697

22:20.870 --> 22:22.942
LET ME DO THE TALKING.

22:25.875 --> 22:28.878

NO, NO. I DON'T NEED YOU
TO GET INVOLVED.

A VESSEL TO CAPTURE A SOUL

ON WORKIN' THE SYSTEM.

23:13.993 --> 23:15.895
IF THERE'S A LOOPHOLE,
HE'LL FIND IT.

YOU GOT ANY WAY
TO MAKE SAM'S GIRLFRIEND
STOP DATING HER EX?

23:20.069 --> 23:20.900
I DON'T FOLLOW.

23:20.900 --> 23:23.733
FORGET IT. IT'S JUST
THE DEVIL BOUGHT
THIS GUY'S SOUL,

23:23.733 --> 23:25.675
AND NOW HE'S MAKING
MY GIRLFRIEND LOVE HIM.

23:25.675 --> 23:28.538

INTO ANYTHING,

23:35.885 --> 23:39.949
BUT HE'S GOT NO DOMINION
OVER THE HUMAN HEART, BRO.

23:39.949 --> 23:42.892

40:10.178 --> 40:12.741
LOOKS LIKE YOUR LIFE'S
STILL IN THE CRAPPER.

40:12.741 --> 40:13.011
AH, THAT SO?

40:13.011 --> 40:16.014
GREG IS ONE SELF-LOATHING
HISSY FIT AWAY

40:16.014 --> 40:17.846
FROM ANOTHER
CHAIN SAW MASSACRE.

40:17.846 --> 40:18.987
YOUR GAL'S IN DANGER.

40:18.987 --> 40:19.918
YOU YOUSELF ARE IN DANGER.

40:19.918 --> 40:23.121
IT'S WHAT
WE CALL IN THE BUSINESS
A CLASSIC CLUSTER "F."

40:23.121 --> 40:24.122
PRETTY PROUD
OF YOURSELF.

40:24.122 --> 40:27.425
HEH HEH. PRIDE IS
MY FAVORITE CARDINAL SIN.

40:27.425 --> 40:28.897
YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO.

40:28.897 --> 40:29.758
KILL GREG.

40:29.758 --> 40:30.899
YEAH. OOH,
SAY THAT AGAIN.

40:30.899 --> 40:33.602
ONLY, THIS TIME,
USE A RUSSIAN ACCENT.

40:33.602 --> 40:34.863
I DON'T THINK SO.

40:34.863 --> 40:36.865
PLEASE.

40:37.506 --> 40:41.039
WELL, I'VE BEEN WONDERING
WHEN I'D SEE THAT AGAIN.

40:41.039 --> 40:44.613
WELL, IT'S NICE TO PUT
A GIFT TO GOOD USE.

40:44.613 --> 40:48.016
IT'S NOT FOR ME.
IT'S FOR GREG.

40:48.847 --> 40:49.217
COME AGAIN.

40:49.217 --> 40:50.879
I'M CANCELING
YOUR DEAL WITH GREG.

40:50.879 --> 40:53.952
HE WON'T GO TO HELL,
HE WON'T HAVE POWER
OVER ANDI,

40:53.952 --> 40:55.584
AND THE CHAIN SAW MANIAC
GOES AWAY.

40:55.584 --> 40:56.925
EVERYTHING
GOES BACK TO NORMAL.

40:56.925 --> 40:57.756
TELL ME I'M WRONG.

40:57.756 --> 41:01.930
YOU SURE YOU DON'T
WANNA USE THIS CARD
FOR YOURSELF, SAM,

41:01.930 --> 41:03.892
GET BACK TO
YOUR REGULAR LIFE?

41:03.892 --> 41:05.994
IT'S A LOT TO GIVE UP.

41:05.994 --> 41:06.635
NO, IT'S NOT.

41:06.635 --> 41:08.066
BECAUSE IT WOULDN'T
WORK FOR ME.

41:08.066 --> 41:09.097
THERE'S ALWAYS
A CATCH, RIGHT?

41:09.097 --> 41:12.901
YOU'D FIND
SOME OTHER WAY
TO SCREW ME OVER.

41:13.542 --> 41:14.943
YOU'RE WISIN' UP, PAL.

41:14.943 --> 41:17.045
MY LITTLE BOY'S
BECOMING A MAN.

41:17.045 --> 41:17.876
SO I'M GIVING IT
TO GREG,

41:17.876 --> 41:21.249
AND I'M BETTING
EVEN YOU CAN'T
GET OUT OF THIS ONE.

41:21.249 --> 41:22.981
OH?

41:22.981 --> 41:25.013
HEH HEH HEH.

41:25.253 --> 41:26.615
CONGRATS, BUDDY.

41:26.615 --> 41:30.118
YOU JUST GAVE UP ETERNITY
FOR A WORKPLACE CRUSH.

41:30.118 --> 41:30.989
WHAT A SUCKER.

41:30.989 --> 41:32.160
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

41:32.160 --> 41:34.563
THERE'S STILL
PLENTY OF TIME.

41:34.563 --> 41:35.894
MAYBE.

41:35.894 --> 41:36.965
MAYBE NOT.

41:36.965 --> 41:39.798
I'LL TAKE MY CHANCES.

41:50.639 --> 41:52.741
WHAT ARE YOU
THINKING ABOUT?

41:52.741 --> 41:54.042
GREG.

41:55.243 --> 41:57.045
I MEAN, NO,
DON'T GET ME WRONG.

41:57.045 --> 42:01.049
HE'S A TOOL, AND
HE ALWAYS WILL BE,
BUT STILL.

42:01.890 --> 42:02.791
BUT WHAT?

42:02.791 --> 42:05.293
I MEAN, HE TRADED
HIS SOUL FOR ME.

42:05.293 --> 42:08.056
IT'S FLATTERING,
BUT CRAZY.

42:08.056 --> 42:11.199
KIND OF ROMANTIC
IN A WAY.

42:11.199 --> 42:15.934
NO, JUST CRAZY.

42:18.607 --> 42:21.710
LOOK, SHOOTING STAR.
