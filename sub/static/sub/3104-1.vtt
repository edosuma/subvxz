<i>This is Zero One Alpha.</i>

01:41.586 --> 01:46.219
<i>We have secured Falcon.
I say again, we have secured Falcon.</i>

01:47.040 --> 01:48.220
By the time I count to ten...

01:48.320 --> 01:50.900
you will have told me exactly
what I need to know.

01:51.000 --> 01:56.047
If not the number ten will be
the last thing you will ever hear.

01:56.240 --> 01:57.943
One, two,

01:58.360 --> 02:00.308
three, four,

02:00.720 --> 02:02.682
five, six,

02:02.880 --> 02:04.463
seven, eight...

02:04.740 --> 02:07.078
Grenade! Sir, get back!

02:20.890 --> 02:22.730
Shit.

02:22.830 --> 02:24.260
Fucking missed it.

02:24.773 --> 02:27.263
How did I fucking miss it?

02:28.528 --> 02:29.955
Merlin...

02:30.055 --> 02:32.839
I apologize for putting you
in this position.

02:32.939 --> 02:34.370
You trained him well.

02:35.468 --> 02:36.940
James...

02:37.835 --> 02:41.141
training is over.

02:42.578 --> 02:44.414
Welcome to Kingsman...

02:45.073 --> 02:47.381
- Lancelot.
- Sir.

02:50.819 --> 02:54.781
I'll deal with this mess... personally.

02:59.646 --> 03:02.899
<i>I very much regret that your husband's
bravery can't be publicly celebrated.</i>

03:03.299 --> 03:04.400
I hope you understand.

03:04.500 --> 03:08.804
How can I understand?
He won't tell me anything.

03:08.904 --> 03:11.852
I didn't even know
he wasn't with his squad.

03:11.952 --> 03:14.665
I'm so sorry, I can't say more.

03:14.777 --> 03:18.013
But I would like to present you
with this Medal of Valor.

03:18.113 --> 03:20.950
And if you look closely
on the back, there's a number.

03:21.450 --> 03:26.325
As a more concrete gesture
of our gratitude, we'd like to offer you...

03:27.433 --> 03:28.524
Let's call it a favor.

03:28.624 --> 03:31.661
The nature of it is your choice.
Just tell the operator,

03:32.161 --> 03:35.496
"Oxfords not brogues,"
and then I'll know it's you.

03:36.966 --> 03:39.619
I don't want your help.

03:39.719 --> 03:42.970
I want my husband back.

03:50.030 --> 03:52.582
- What's your name, young man?
- Eggsy.

03:52.882 --> 03:55.066
Hello, Eggsy.

03:55.184 --> 03:57.240
Can I see that?

04:03.292 --> 04:06.229
You take care of this, Eggsy.

04:06.329 --> 04:08.162
All right?

04:11.749 --> 04:14.412
And take care of your mum, too.

04:54.209 --> 04:57.613
So sorry, Professor Arnold.
Just a tiny bit more.

04:57.713 --> 05:00.550
Oh, for God's sakes, just rip it off.

05:00.650 --> 05:04.387
I'm under very strict instructions
not to hurt you.

05:04.487 --> 05:08.290
Look, you've made a mistake.
I'm a university lecturer.

05:08.390 --> 05:11.027
- I've got no money.
- This isn't about money.

05:11.227 --> 05:15.298
- Our boss just wants to talk to you.
- Am I meant to find that reassuring?

05:15.398 --> 05:18.649
He'll be here soon. He'll explain.

05:18.749 --> 05:23.704
Do you like whiskey?
Red, get the '62 Dalmore.

05:25.041 --> 05:28.111
Honestly, this whiskey, it's amazing.

05:28.511 --> 05:30.516
You will shit.

05:49.870 --> 05:52.900
I suppose asking to borrow
a cup of sugar is a step too far.

06:15.958 --> 06:19.727
Professor Arnold...
I'm here to take you home.

06:30.683 --> 06:32.936
1962 Dalmore.

06:33.036 --> 06:35.449
It'd be a sin to spill any.

06:35.549 --> 06:37.625
Don't you think?

07:17.838 --> 07:20.947
Can you hold these? Please?

07:34.003 --> 07:36.042
Thank you.

07:41.644 --> 07:43.538
Everything is clean.

07:49.451 --> 07:52.452
My kind of welcome.

07:59.528 --> 08:02.428
No stomach for violence.
I mean, literally.

08:02.528 --> 08:05.785
I see one drop of blood,
that is me done.

08:05.885 --> 08:08.596
I'm like... projectile.

08:08.696 --> 08:14.243
Listen, I'm so sorry you had
to witness all this unpleasantness,

08:14.343 --> 08:16.509
due to our uninvited guest.

08:16.609 --> 08:20.917
But I promise you, by the time
I've found out who he works for,

08:21.017 --> 08:26.086
<i>you and I will be the best of friends.</i>

08:31.961 --> 08:34.128
To the shop, please.

08:57.373 --> 08:59.832
Arthur's in the dining room, sir.

09:09.098 --> 09:11.809
- Arthur.
- Galahad.

09:11.909 --> 09:16.570
The others were beginning to wonder
if we were going to have a double toast.

09:19.054 --> 09:22.440
Gentlemen, I'm thankful to say
it's been 17 years

09:22.540 --> 09:25.515
since we last had occasion
to use this decanter.

09:26.595 --> 09:30.952
Lancelot... was an outstanding agent
and a true Kingsman.

09:31.052 --> 09:33.589
He will be sorely missed.

09:33.889 --> 09:35.758
To Lancelot.

09:35.858 --> 09:37.991
To Lancelot.

09:41.531 --> 09:46.803
I intend to start the selection process
for Lancelot's replacement tomorrow.

09:46.903 --> 09:51.674
I want each of you to propose a candidate
and have them report to UKHQ

09:51.974 --> 09:55.476
no later than 9:00 p.m. GMT. Thank you.

09:58.386 --> 10:01.551
Merlin. Come in.

10:02.051 --> 10:04.787
Lancelot was investigating
a group of mercenaries

10:04.887 --> 10:07.490
who were experimenting
with biological weaponry.

10:07.590 --> 10:09.839
Glasses, gentlemen, please.

10:11.360 --> 10:15.347
Uganda, 2012. Synthetic cathinones.

10:15.447 --> 10:18.302
They put it in the water supply
of a guerilla army base...

10:18.402 --> 10:23.080
rage, cannibalism, multiple fatalities.

10:23.705 --> 10:27.243
Chechnya, 2013.
Insurgents turned on one another.

10:27.343 --> 10:30.980
Indisputably, the work of our mercenaries,
but no trace of any chemicals of any kind.

10:31.280 --> 10:33.243
So what happened to Lancelot?

10:33.343 --> 10:36.285
He tracked them to this property
in Argentina.

10:36.585 --> 10:38.601
While he had them under surveillance,
he became aware

10:38.701 --> 10:40.662
they'd effected a kidnapping.

10:40.762 --> 10:44.861
So he executed a solo rescue mission,
which failed.

10:45.661 --> 10:48.194
This is his last transmission.

10:48.931 --> 10:51.567
- Who is he?
- Some climate-change doomsayer,

10:51.667 --> 10:55.304
expounds something called Gaia theory
about the world healing itself or some such.

10:55.404 --> 10:59.208
But what's curious
is he's not actually missing.

10:59.711 --> 11:02.347
This is Professor Arnold...

11:02.447 --> 11:04.203
at Imperial College this morning.

11:05.381 --> 11:07.039
It's all yours.

11:07.339 --> 11:09.679
And don't forget
your membership proposal.

11:09.779 --> 11:12.722
Try picking a more suitable
candidate this time.

11:12.922 --> 11:14.503
17 years,

11:14.603 --> 11:18.544
and still evolving with the times remains
an entirely foreign concept to you.

11:18.644 --> 11:22.031
Need I remind you I wouldn't be here
if it weren't for that young man?

11:22.131 --> 11:26.101
He was as much Kingsman material
as any of them. More so.

11:26.201 --> 11:29.171
But he wasn't exactly one of us, was he?

11:29.982 --> 11:33.507
Let's face it, Galahad,
your little experiment failed.

11:34.977 --> 11:37.813
With respect, Arthur, you're a snob.

11:37.913 --> 11:39.048
With respect?

11:40.214 --> 11:42.564
The world is changing.

11:42.664 --> 11:46.519
There's a reason why aristocrats
developed weak chins.

12:05.425 --> 12:07.277
Eggsy?

12:08.711 --> 12:11.305
Eggsy, come here.

12:13.415 --> 12:15.201
- Got any Rizla, babe?
- No.

12:15.301 --> 12:17.586
Why don't you do your mum a favor,
go down to the shop and get some?

12:17.686 --> 12:18.888
- Get them yourself.
- Oi.

12:18.988 --> 12:21.857
What have I said to you
about speaking to Dean like that?

12:22.057 --> 12:25.506
Three's a crowd, isn't it?
Why don't Dean's poodle go?

12:25.606 --> 12:29.031
I'll tell you what. Why don't you take this,
go and get some Rizlas,

12:29.131 --> 12:31.957
get yourself some sweets...
and while you're gone,

12:32.057 --> 12:34.988
we'll show your mother
how three can be good company.

12:37.739 --> 12:39.603
Thanks, babe.

12:40.476 --> 12:42.109
Come here.

12:46.346 --> 12:48.368
There we go.

12:49.068 --> 12:50.150
Is that better?

13:05.166 --> 13:07.469
If Dean treats your mum so bad,
why don't she leave him?

13:07.569 --> 13:09.638
Low self-esteem, that's her problem.

13:09.738 --> 13:13.645
Fuck off. Why would she have
low self-esteem? Eggsy's mum is well fit.

13:13.745 --> 13:16.388
- No offense, bruv.
- It's all right.

13:16.994 --> 13:19.281
One of these days,
I'm gonna smash his face in.

13:19.381 --> 13:20.956
Are you mental, cuz?

13:21.056 --> 13:25.046
He'd just get that lot to do you
and then pretend he knew nothing...

13:25.846 --> 13:26.651
about it.

13:26.751 --> 13:29.795
Oi! You think you can chat shit
about us and we won't do nothing

13:29.895 --> 13:32.294
just 'cause our guvnor's
banging Eggsy's mum?

13:32.394 --> 13:34.244
Pretty much, yeah.

13:34.344 --> 13:37.482
Bruv, just leave it. Let's just go, man.
It's not worth it.

13:37.582 --> 13:40.169
You boys have outstayed your welcome.

13:40.669 --> 13:42.679
Leave.

13:43.452 --> 13:45.090
What?

13:45.190 --> 13:47.507
I'm sorry about that, bruv.

13:50.212 --> 13:52.915
Yeah. Mug.

13:54.324 --> 13:57.022
They weren't fucking worth it, boys.

13:57.719 --> 14:01.056
It's freezing. Why are we walking?

14:01.156 --> 14:05.694
- You jacked his fucking car keys, bruv?
- Yeah. Now we're gonna nick his car.

14:05.794 --> 14:08.862
- Fucking...
- Shit. Move, bruv!

14:13.370 --> 14:15.643
Hold on, boys.

14:17.339 --> 14:20.743
Hey, that's my fucking car! Hey! Hey!

14:20.843 --> 14:23.895
Eggsy, I swear,
you want to fucking stop it!

14:23.995 --> 14:26.413
You're a fucking dead man! Stop it!

14:29.283 --> 14:31.477
I'm gonna fuckin' have ya!

14:33.402 --> 14:35.244
Come on.

14:35.557 --> 14:37.925
Floor it, Eggsy! Floor it!

14:39.061 --> 14:41.128
Wanker!

14:42.031 --> 14:45.834
Yeah, yeah, Dean, look, it's me.
Eggsy just stole my fucking car, yeah.

14:45.934 --> 14:47.953
Yeah, I've come out the pub,
he's done about 15 doughnuts

14:48.053 --> 14:50.466
in my fucking face, and he's drove off.

14:50.566 --> 14:55.255
No, I can't have it! He's disrespecting me,
and that means he's disrespecting you.

14:55.355 --> 14:57.876
Oh, hold up! What the...

15:13.829 --> 15:15.195
Come on, Eggsy!

15:39.059 --> 15:40.447
Dickhead.

15:41.924 --> 15:45.460
Foxes are vermin, cuz.
Should've driven it over.

15:45.560 --> 15:49.164
Should've done a lot of things.
I'll sort this. Get out of the car.

15:49.964 --> 15:51.898
I said, get out of the fucking car!

16:00.542 --> 16:03.879
Eggsy, there is no such thing
as honor amongst thieves.

16:04.944 --> 16:09.184
Now, you can start giving me some names
of the boys you were with,

16:09.284 --> 16:12.721
or you go down. It's up to you.

16:13.998 --> 16:16.861
I want to exercise my right
to a phone call.

16:18.460 --> 16:21.976
Well... I hope it's to your mum,

16:22.076 --> 16:25.581
to tell her you're gonna be
18 months late for your dinner.

16:56.331 --> 16:59.267
<i>Customer Complaints, how may I help you?</i>

16:59.698 --> 17:03.438
My name's Eggsy Unwin.
Sorry, Gary Unwin.

17:03.538 --> 17:05.807
And... I'm up shit creek.

17:05.906 --> 17:08.609
I'm in Holborn police station,
and my mum said to call this number

17:08.710 --> 17:11.880
- if ever I needed help and...
- <i>I'm sorry, sir. Wrong number.</i>

17:11.980 --> 17:14.250
Wait! Wait!

17:14.950 --> 17:17.483
Oxfords not brogues?

17:19.005 --> 17:20.689
<i>Your complaint has been duly noted,</i>

17:20.789 --> 17:24.327
<i>and we hope that we have not
lost you as a loyal customer.</i>

17:35.103 --> 17:37.106
Yeah.

17:37.706 --> 17:39.708
You what?

17:40.508 --> 17:43.545
I... Yeah.

17:43.645 --> 17:46.646
Yes, I totally understand.

18:05.714 --> 18:07.841
Eggsy.

18:07.941 --> 18:09.735
Would you like a lift home?

18:09.835 --> 18:12.424
- Who are you?
- The man who got you released.

18:12.524 --> 18:16.845
- That ain't an answer.
- A little gratitude would be nice.

18:17.445 --> 18:20.847
My name is Harry Hart,
and I gave you that medal.

18:22.484 --> 18:25.051
Your father saved my life.

18:27.724 --> 18:29.891
So before you was a tailor,
was you in the army?

18:30.443 --> 18:33.428
- Like an officer?
- Not quite.

18:33.528 --> 18:35.397
So where was you posted,
Iraq or something?

18:35.497 --> 18:38.271
Sorry, Eggsy, classified.

18:38.871 --> 18:41.415
But my dad saved your life, yeah?

18:41.515 --> 18:45.806
The day your father died,
I missed something.

18:46.108 --> 18:48.507
And if it weren't for his courage,
my mistake would've cost the lives

18:48.607 --> 18:50.287
of every man present.

18:51.286 --> 18:53.342
So I owe him.

18:53.915 --> 18:56.485
Your father was a brave man.

18:57.185 --> 18:59.137
A good man.

18:59.237 --> 19:01.690
And having read your files,
I think he'd be bitterly disappointed

19:01.790 --> 19:04.159
- in the choices you've made.
- You can't talk to me like that.

19:04.259 --> 19:08.012
Huge IQ, great performance
at primary school...

19:08.112 --> 19:12.301
and it all went tits up.
Drugs, petty crime, never had a job.

19:12.401 --> 19:14.236
Oh, you think there's a lot of jobs
going around here, do you?

19:14.336 --> 19:15.904
Doesn't explain why
you gave up your hobbies.

19:16.004 --> 19:20.142
First prize, regional Under-10s
gymnastics two years in a row.

19:20.242 --> 19:22.411
Your coach had you pegged
as Olympic team material.

19:22.511 --> 19:24.313
Yeah, well, when you grow up
around someone like my stepdad,

19:24.413 --> 19:27.583
- you pick up new hobbies pretty quick.
- Of course. Always someone else's fault.

19:29.430 --> 19:31.153
Who's to blame for you
quitting the Marines?

19:31.253 --> 19:33.588
You were halfway through training,
doing brilliantly, but you gave up.

19:33.688 --> 19:35.824
Because my mum went mental.

19:35.924 --> 19:38.827
Banging on about losing me
as well as my dad.

19:38.927 --> 19:41.380
Didn't want me being cannon fodder
for snobs like you!

19:41.480 --> 19:42.624
Judging people like me

19:42.724 --> 19:46.201
from your ivory towers with no thought
about why we do what we do.

19:46.701 --> 19:49.738
We ain't got much choice. You get me?

19:49.838 --> 19:52.307
And if we was born with the same
silver spoon up our arses,

19:52.407 --> 19:55.327
we'd do just as well as you...
if not better.

19:55.427 --> 19:58.144
What the fuck you doing here?
You taking the piss?

19:59.948 --> 20:02.934
Some more examples of young men
who simply need a silver suppository?

20:03.034 --> 20:06.255
- No, they're exceptions. Come on.
- Nonsense. We haven't finished our drinks.

20:06.355 --> 20:08.991
After you nicked his car,
Dean says you're fair game.

20:09.091 --> 20:12.025
- He don't give a shit what your mum says.
- Listen, boys...

20:13.595 --> 20:15.530
I've had a rather emotional day,

20:15.630 --> 20:19.901
so whatever your beef with Eggsy is,
and I'm sure it's well-founded,

20:20.401 --> 20:23.672
I'd appreciate it enormously
if you could just leave us in peace

20:23.772 --> 20:26.676
until I finish this lovely pint
of Guinness.

20:29.815 --> 20:32.514
You should get out of the way, Granddad,
or you'll get hurt and all.

20:32.614 --> 20:35.433
He ain't joking. You should go.

20:40.922 --> 20:43.458
Excuse me. Excuse me.

20:43.858 --> 20:46.593
If you're looking for another rent boy,
they're on the corner of Smith Street.

20:52.537 --> 20:53.784
Manners...

20:55.003 --> 20:56.283
maketh...

20:59.148 --> 21:00.616
man.

21:08.083 --> 21:10.349
Do you know what that means?

21:11.886 --> 21:13.887
Then let me teach you a lesson.

21:22.707 --> 21:26.589
Are we going to stand around here
all day, or are we going to fight?

22:10.562 --> 22:13.546
You fucking dirty, fucking dirty...

22:54.889 --> 22:59.094
Sorry about that.
Needed to let off a little steam.

22:59.194 --> 23:02.397
I heard yesterday a friend of mine died.

23:03.110 --> 23:05.031
He knew your father, too, actually.

23:07.614 --> 23:09.778
Now, I do apologize, Eggsy.

23:09.878 --> 23:12.097
I shouldn't have done this
in front of you.

23:12.197 --> 23:15.028
No, please, I won't say nothing. I swear.
If there's one thing I can do,

23:15.128 --> 23:16.587
- it's keep my mouth shut.
- You won't tell a soul?

23:16.687 --> 23:18.392
Ask the Feds.
I've never grassed anyone up.

23:18.492 --> 23:21.247
- Is that a promise?
- On my life!

23:24.986 --> 23:26.822
Much appreciated, Eggsy.

23:27.022 --> 23:31.192
You're right about the snobs.
But there, too, there are exceptions.

23:32.192 --> 23:34.399
Best of luck with everything.

23:48.343 --> 23:52.480
<i>In celebrity news, the Richmond Valentine
movie premiered in Hollywood last night.</i>

23:52.580 --> 23:55.483
<i>The story of the Internet billionaire's
rise to power</i>

23:55.583 --> 23:58.353
<i>is expected to be
this award season's hot ticket.</i>

23:58.453 --> 24:01.804
<i>One notable absence
from the red carpet was Iggy Azalea,</i>

24:01.904 --> 24:05.260
<i>still missing three days after she failed
to appear at her Oakland concert.</i>

24:05.360 --> 24:06.978
<i>No ransom has been demanded.</i>

24:07.078 --> 24:09.582
Eggsy, just go, please,
because he's gonna...

24:10.265 --> 24:11.841
No, please, don't hurt him!

24:11.941 --> 24:15.046
Fuck off! Get the fuck away with you!
Shut the fuck up!

24:15.146 --> 24:17.266
Who was with you in that fucking pub?

24:17.366 --> 24:19.708
I want to know the name
of the geezer you was with!

24:19.808 --> 24:21.643
- I wasn't with no one!
- Who was it?

24:21.743 --> 24:23.211
- I don't know what you're on about.
- Who was it?

24:23.311 --> 24:25.747
- I don't know who you're fucking on about!
- Fucking tell me his name!

24:25.847 --> 24:28.860
I don't know
who you're fucking on about!

24:30.919 --> 24:33.554
<i>You... listen to me!</i>

24:33.654 --> 24:35.691
<i>I want to know who you was with
in that pub. Do you understand?</i>

24:35.791 --> 24:37.630
<i>I want to know his fucking name!</i>

24:37.730 --> 24:40.846
<i>Because, I swear,
I'll rip your head off.</i>

24:40.946 --> 24:42.764
- <i>Tell me!</i>
- <i>I don't know what you're fucking on about!</i>

24:42.864 --> 24:44.065
<i>Tell me!</i>

24:44.165 --> 24:47.295
- Just tell him, Eggsy!
- Fuck off! Fuck off, Michelle!

24:47.395 --> 24:51.439
I could kill you right now,
and no one in the whole world will notice!

24:51.539 --> 24:53.228
<i>But I would.</i>

24:53.368 --> 24:56.200
I have enough evidence on your activities
to have you locked up

24:56.300 --> 24:58.974
for the rest of your life,
Mr. Dean Anthony Baker.

24:59.074 --> 25:01.285
- What the fuck?!
- <i>So I suggest you leave the boy alone,</i>

25:01.385 --> 25:05.219
<i>or I shall be forced to deliver it
to the appropriate authorities.</i>

25:06.041 --> 25:08.846
<i>Eggsy, meet me at the tailor
I told you about.</i>

25:08.946 --> 25:11.960
What the fuck's going on here?

25:13.417 --> 25:16.231
Eggsy, you fucking maggot!
Hey, we got a racer!

25:16.331 --> 25:17.632
Hey!

25:18.332 --> 25:21.422
Eggsy, you fucking... Come here, son!

25:33.414 --> 25:37.216
You wanker! I'll have you, son!

26:01.710 --> 26:05.712
I've never met a tailor before,
but I know you ain't one.

26:09.878 --> 26:11.350
Come with me.

26:20.078 --> 26:22.095
Come on in.

26:27.049 --> 26:28.057
What do you see?

26:28.357 --> 26:32.239
Someone who wants to know
what the fuck is going on.

26:33.374 --> 26:36.411
I see a young man with potential.

26:37.111 --> 26:39.856
A young man who is loyal,

26:39.956 --> 26:41.809
who can do as he's asked,

26:41.909 --> 26:45.286
and who wants to do
something good with his life.

26:46.144 --> 26:48.794
Did you see the film Trading Places?

26:48.894 --> 26:50.545
No.

26:50.645 --> 26:52.754
How about Nikita?

26:53.227 --> 26:55.533
Pretty Woman?

26:55.633 --> 26:58.500
All right. My point is,
that the lack of a silver spoon

26:58.600 --> 27:01.970
has set you on a certain path,
but you needn't stay on it.

27:02.070 --> 27:05.264
If you're prepared to adapt and learn,

27:05.364 --> 27:07.026
you can transform.

27:07.126 --> 27:09.955
Oh, like in My Fair Lady.

27:10.445 --> 27:12.578
Well, you're full of surprises.

27:12.678 --> 27:16.050
Yes, like My Fair Lady.

27:16.365 --> 27:19.621
Only, in this case, I'm offering you
the opportunity to become a Kingsman.

27:20.421 --> 27:23.358
- A tailor?
- A Kingsman agent.

27:25.028 --> 27:27.589
- Like a spy?
- Of sorts.

27:29.630 --> 27:33.154
- Interested?
- You think I've got anything to lose?

27:40.741 --> 27:46.347
Since 1849, Kingsman tailors have clothed
the world's most powerful individuals.

27:46.447 --> 27:51.719
By 1919, a great number of them
had lost their heirs to World War I.

27:51.819 --> 27:55.385
That meant a lot of money
going uninherited,

27:55.485 --> 27:59.260
and a lot of powerful men with a desire
to preserve peace and protect life.

27:59.560 --> 28:02.529
Our founders realized that they could
channel that wealth and influence

28:02.629 --> 28:04.399
for the greater good.

28:04.499 --> 28:08.082
And so began our other venture.

28:08.582 --> 28:10.839
An independent, international
intelligence agency

28:10.939 --> 28:14.959
operating at the highest level
of discretion.

28:15.059 --> 28:17.946
Above the politics and bureaucracy
that undermine the integrity

28:18.046 --> 28:21.649
of government-run spy organizations.

28:21.749 --> 28:24.916
The suit is a modern gentleman's armor,

28:25.016 --> 28:27.916
and the Kingsman agents
are the new knights.

28:29.139 --> 28:31.824
- How deep does this fucking thing go?
- Deep enough.

29:16.537 --> 29:18.804
Shit, we're late.

29:42.890 --> 29:46.097
Your father had the same look
on his face.

29:47.168 --> 29:49.235
As did I.

29:50.171 --> 29:52.038
Come on.

29:53.941 --> 29:56.277
- Galahad.
- My code name.

29:56.377 --> 29:58.271
Late again, sir.

29:58.371 --> 29:59.932
Good luck.

30:00.032 --> 30:02.047
In you go.

30:12.693 --> 30:14.923
Fall in.

30:16.196 --> 30:19.133
Ladies and gentlemen, my name is Merlin.

30:19.233 --> 30:20.254
You are about to embark

30:20.354 --> 30:23.831
on what is probably the most dangerous
job interview in the world.

30:23.931 --> 30:29.143
One of you, and only one of you,
will become the next Lancelot.

30:29.543 --> 30:32.747
Can anybody tell me what this is?

30:33.855 --> 30:35.250
- Yes?
- Body bag, sir.

30:35.350 --> 30:38.820
- Correct. Charlie, isn't it?
- Yes, sir.

30:38.920 --> 30:42.290
Good. In a moment,
you will each collect a body bag.

30:42.390 --> 30:44.259
You will write your name on that bag.

30:44.559 --> 30:47.929
You will write the details
of your next of kin on that bag.

30:48.029 --> 30:51.599
This represents your acknowledgment
of the risks that you're about to face

30:51.699 --> 30:54.636
as well as your agreement
to strict confidentiality.

30:54.736 --> 30:59.608
Which, incidentally, if you break,
will result in you and your next of kin

30:59.708 --> 31:02.569
being in that bag.

31:04.345 --> 31:06.915
Is that understood?

31:07.215 --> 31:10.282
Excellent. Fall out.

31:17.541 --> 31:19.928
Roxanne. But call me Roxy.

31:20.728 --> 31:22.197
- I'm Eggsy.
- "Eggy"?

31:22.297 --> 31:26.167
- No, "Eggsy."
- Eggy? And where did they dig you up?

31:26.267 --> 31:28.483
You know we're not allowed to discuss
who proposed us.

31:28.583 --> 31:32.821
No need to bite his head off. Charlie's
only making conversation, right, Charlie?

31:32.921 --> 31:35.944
- I'm Digby.
- Digby.

31:36.044 --> 31:40.078
Eggy, this is Rufus. Rufus, Eggy.

31:41.649 --> 31:45.520
- So, Eggy, are you Oxford or Cambridge?
- Neither.

31:45.620 --> 31:47.055
- Saint Andrews?
- Durham?

31:47.155 --> 31:49.123
No, wait, I think we may have met.

31:49.223 --> 31:53.027
Did you serve me at the McDonald's
in Winchester service station?

31:53.127 --> 31:56.673
- No.
- It's definitely Saint Andrews.

31:57.601 --> 31:59.937
- Just ignore them.
- You need a pen?

32:00.037 --> 32:02.462
- Cheers.
- Amelia, isn't it?

32:02.562 --> 32:05.209
- Amelia, Eggsy.
- Hi, Eggsy.

32:05.659 --> 32:09.128
- Don't take any notice of those guys.
- That's what I told him.

32:11.338 --> 32:14.535
It's just scare tactics.
Classic Army technique.

32:14.935 --> 32:17.074
No one's gonna die.

32:20.089 --> 32:22.212
Shame.

32:23.356 --> 32:29.078
Great. You don't know, the CIA don't know.
Nobody knows who this guy is?

32:29.178 --> 32:31.719
Fine. Seriously, it's fine.

32:31.819 --> 32:35.856
Well, it's not really fine,
but it's not why I'm here.

32:35.956 --> 32:39.360
Hell, man, you know me.
Money's not my issue.

32:39.460 --> 32:41.188
I could've retired straight out of MIT,

32:41.360 --> 32:43.864
fucked off to some island,
let the business run itself.

32:43.964 --> 32:48.602
Nobody told me to try
and save the planet. I wanted to.

32:48.702 --> 32:52.440
Climate change research, lobbying,
years of study, billions of dollars,

32:52.540 --> 32:54.710
and you know why I quit?

32:54.810 --> 32:59.880
Because the last time I checked,
the planet was still fucked.

32:59.980 --> 33:02.450
Hence, my epiphany.

33:02.550 --> 33:05.586
Money won't solve this.

33:05.686 --> 33:09.823
Those idiots who call themselves politicians
have buried their heads in the sand

33:09.923 --> 33:13.026
and stood for nothing but reelection.

33:13.126 --> 33:18.032
So I spent the last two years
trying to find a real solution.

33:18.132 --> 33:21.068
And I found it.

33:21.168 --> 33:24.338
Now, if you really want to make
the world a better place,

33:24.438 --> 33:29.022
I suggest you open your fucking ears,
because I'm about to tell it to you.

33:29.122 --> 33:33.266
Go on, Mr. Valentine.
I'm still listening.

33:33.366 --> 33:37.581
As long as you agree to all my terms.

34:20.092 --> 34:22.413
- The fuck is this?
- What's going on?

34:23.764 --> 34:25.266
Oh, shit. Jesus!

34:25.366 --> 34:26.967
All right, no one panic. Listen to me.

34:27.067 --> 34:29.768
- Stay calm.
- Fuck.

34:32.139 --> 34:33.674
Loo snorkels, loo snorkels!

34:33.774 --> 34:36.879
- Loo snorkels?
- Showerheads!

34:36.978 --> 34:40.331
- Showerheads?!
- She's right. Go! Fucking go!

34:41.315 --> 34:43.782
Hey, hang about,
what's wrong with the fucking door?

36:07.568 --> 36:10.237
Congratulations on completing
your first task.

36:10.637 --> 36:13.107
Charlie, Roxy, well done.

36:13.207 --> 36:15.299
For those of you who are still confused,

36:15.399 --> 36:17.618
if you can get a breathing tube
around a U-bend of a toilet,

36:17.718 --> 36:22.149
you have an unlimited air supply.
Simple physics, worth remembering.

36:22.249 --> 36:25.546
Eggsy, well done for spotting
that was a two-way mirror.

36:25.646 --> 36:26.821
He's probably seen enough of them.

36:26.921 --> 36:29.890
Yeah, you can all wipe
those smirks off your faces.

36:29.990 --> 36:33.794
Because as far as I'm concerned,
every single one of you has failed.

36:34.294 --> 36:37.198
You all forgot the most
important thing...

36:38.198 --> 36:40.149
teamwork.

36:53.880 --> 36:56.881
So much for classic Army technique.

36:59.452 --> 37:00.788
Thirty-five.

37:01.499 --> 37:03.509
One-oh-five.

37:03.609 --> 37:05.824
That's it. That's it.

37:10.500 --> 37:12.969
Hello. Can I help you?

37:13.069 --> 37:16.503
Yes. I have a question
about anthropogenic force.

37:18.109 --> 37:21.072
Really? Well, it's actually
quite fascinating.

37:23.009 --> 37:26.413
My colleague died trying to rescue you,
and I'm sure you saw how well trained he was,

37:26.513 --> 37:29.422
so I suggest you tell me who kidnapped you
and why they let you go.

37:29.522 --> 37:31.469
I have no idea what you're talking...

37:31.569 --> 37:34.435
I'm not supposed to say it,
but it was...

37:34.535 --> 37:36.257
Oh, for God's sake,
I've barely touched you.

37:36.357 --> 37:38.423
Oh, man up!

37:58.578 --> 38:00.502
Fuck that guy, whoever he is.
I'm gonna...

38:02.126 --> 38:05.718
He made me kill Professor Arnold.
I goddamn loved Professor Arnold.

38:05.818 --> 38:08.749
The good news is we know the emergency
and surveillance system work.

38:08.849 --> 38:10.890
You know what's not good news?

38:10.990 --> 38:14.361
"My colleague died!"
That's what he said!

38:14.461 --> 38:17.831
This is an organization, and they're
all over us. Whoever you spoke to...

38:17.931 --> 38:22.803
I told you, I made contact
with the KGB, MI6, Mossad and Beijing.

38:22.903 --> 38:26.239
- They all insist he wasn't one of theirs.
- Beijing.

38:26.339 --> 38:30.811
So freaky how there's no recognizable
name for the Chinese secret service.

38:30.911 --> 38:33.013
Now, that's what you call
a secret, right?

38:34.113 --> 38:35.816
You know what? Fuck it.

38:36.316 --> 38:39.453
We need to speed things up.
Bring the product release forward.

38:39.553 --> 38:42.923
We're only halfway into production,
and speeding it will cost a fortune.

38:43.223 --> 38:46.525
I look like I give a fuck?
Just get it done.

38:49.195 --> 38:52.733
As some of you will have learned
last night,

38:53.133 --> 38:56.037
teamwork is paramount here at Kingsman.

38:56.137 --> 39:00.240
We're here to enhance your skills,
test you to the limit.

39:00.340 --> 39:04.044
Which is why you're gonna pick a puppy.

39:04.144 --> 39:08.215
Wherever you go, your dog goes.
You will care for it, you will teach it,

39:08.315 --> 39:11.618
and by the time it's fully trained,
so will you be.

39:11.718 --> 39:14.054
Those of you who are
still here, that is.

39:14.254 --> 39:16.123
Do you understand?

39:16.423 --> 39:18.485
Choose your puppy.

39:20.963 --> 39:23.063
- A poodle?
- What?

39:23.463 --> 39:25.098
They're gun dogs.

39:25.198 --> 39:28.533
Oldest working breed. Easy to train.

39:29.736 --> 39:31.338
A pug?

39:32.338 --> 39:34.664
It's a bulldog, innit?

39:36.476 --> 39:39.514
It'll get bigger though, won't it?

39:41.648 --> 39:43.709
Shit.

39:45.819 --> 39:49.356
His MRI shows no signs of concussion.

39:49.456 --> 39:52.626
No direct brain trauma at all.

39:52.726 --> 39:56.063
- How much longer can he be out?
- That's the million-dollar question.

39:56.163 --> 39:58.165
We don't know what he was
exposed to in there.

39:58.265 --> 40:01.533
What about Harry's footage?
It didn't stream to his home terminal.

40:01.633 --> 40:04.883
Encrypted and uncrackable.

40:04.983 --> 40:07.011
If and when he comes around,
you might want to have a word with him

40:07.111 --> 40:10.513
- about sharing his password.
- Is he gonna be all right?

40:11.889 --> 40:15.215
We need to have patience, Eggsy.
But there's hope, okay?

40:15.715 --> 40:17.551
If I were you, I'd concentrate
on your training.

40:17.651 --> 40:19.784
Make it through the tests.
Make him proud.

40:26.726 --> 40:29.162
Fuck! Come on, come on, come on!

40:29.262 --> 40:31.554
J.B., come on! Come on!

40:34.400 --> 40:36.753
I'm not coming last 'cause of you.

40:37.253 --> 40:39.573
J.B., I'll shoot you!
Goddamn you, I'll fucking shoot you!

40:40.973 --> 40:43.985
Merlin said
we're not allowed to hold you.

40:44.911 --> 40:46.177
Bollocks.

41:28.789 --> 41:30.482
Water!

41:32.993 --> 41:34.528
- Come on, then!
- Eggsy, forget it!

41:34.628 --> 41:36.229
Oh, what's wrong, mate?
You can't take a joke?

41:36.329 --> 41:38.599
Seriously, you'll get thrown out,
and it's just not worth it.

41:38.699 --> 41:40.200
Maybe I don't give a fuck
if I get kicked out!

41:40.300 --> 41:43.203
- Do it. Come on, you pleb.
- Charlie, fuck off!

41:45.438 --> 41:47.786
Yeah, go on, walk away.

41:47.886 --> 41:49.625
Dickhead.

41:49.725 --> 41:51.977
Come on, J.B. Come on, good boy.

42:05.897 --> 42:09.961
You have exactly one hour
to complete the test, starting now.

42:12.032 --> 42:13.767
New target, 800 meters.

42:13.867 --> 42:15.636
You know, it's unbelievable.
You're still here,

42:15.736 --> 42:19.290
lingering like some big steaming shit
that just won't flush.

42:19.390 --> 42:23.143
Roger that. Target identified.
And how about you shut the fuck up?

42:23.243 --> 42:26.073
Positive discrimination,
that's what it is.

42:26.173 --> 42:29.487
It's like those fucking state school kids
who get into Oxford on "C" grades

42:29.587 --> 42:32.836
- 'cause their mum is a one-legged lesbian.
- You don't know fuck all about my grades.

42:32.936 --> 42:36.364
Oh, forgive me, I'm sure you're highly
educated. Fire when ready.

42:38.591 --> 42:40.492
How's that for positive discrimination?

42:53.373 --> 42:54.978
I want to thank you both for listening,

42:55.078 --> 42:59.479
and I really, really appreciate you
traveling all this way, Your Royal Highness.

42:59.779 --> 43:01.448
And you, too, Prime Minister.

43:01.548 --> 43:04.551
I think this is quite brilliant.

43:05.051 --> 43:07.966
It's absolutely brilliant.

43:08.388 --> 43:12.969
You are completely crazy.

43:13.200 --> 43:14.770
And as for you, Prime Minister

43:14.880 --> 43:17.087
I'm speechless you'd even consider this.

43:22.469 --> 43:25.455
- Don't touch...
- Sorry, Your Royal Highness.

43:25.555 --> 43:29.276
But you've got a big role to play in getting
the Scandinavian region back on track.

43:29.676 --> 43:33.580
You're popular, inspirational, and you have
the power to galvanize the people.

43:33.780 --> 43:36.783
Now, whether you're on board or not,

43:36.883 --> 43:41.388
I'm going to have to insist on getting you
somewhere I can ensure your safety.

43:41.988 --> 43:44.124
How about you, Prime Minister?
You in or out?

43:45.217 --> 43:49.863
Well, I think it's about time
that a politician did something that...

43:49.963 --> 43:52.007
actually made a difference.

43:52.107 --> 43:53.734
Too true.

43:54.034 --> 43:56.895
- What...?
- Take her away.

44:00.006 --> 44:03.341
- Drink?
- Why not?

44:05.200 --> 44:07.168
Guards! Help!

44:07.280 --> 44:09.650
Don't worry. No harm
will come to the princess.

44:10.150 --> 44:14.219
Well, I'm a republican anyway,
so it... it really doesn't matter.

44:15.789 --> 44:17.220
Release the princess!

44:50.657 --> 44:53.977
Okay, you're done. Not so bad, right?

44:54.077 --> 44:55.929
Hardly felt a thing.

44:56.029 --> 44:57.998
Welcome aboard.

44:58.098 --> 45:00.331
Pleasure is all mine.

45:06.341 --> 45:08.313
Ever heard of knocking?

45:08.413 --> 45:11.189
Only when I'm casing a place to rob.

45:11.289 --> 45:13.499
Merlin said you wanted to see me.

45:13.699 --> 45:15.976
I hope J.B.'s training is going
as well as yours is.

45:16.076 --> 45:17.944
Sit.

45:19.046 --> 45:22.609
Congratulations on making it
to the final six candidates.

45:22.709 --> 45:25.089
Your test results were even better
than I could've hoped.

45:27.760 --> 45:29.681
Come in.

45:33.166 --> 45:36.870
Eggsy, I need to have a private
conversation. You're dismissed.

45:36.970 --> 45:41.041
Nonsense. Let him observe.
Might learn a thing or two.

45:41.141 --> 45:43.344
As you wish. Take a look at this.

45:43.444 --> 45:46.046
<i>Oh, for God's sake, I've barely
touched you. Oh, man up!</i>

45:46.621 --> 45:51.184
Fucking hell! That is rank, Harry.

45:51.284 --> 45:54.487
You blew up his head?
It's a bit much, innit?

45:54.587 --> 45:58.024
Actually, the explosion was caused
by an implant in his neck.

45:58.324 --> 46:00.126
Here, under the scar.

46:00.226 --> 46:02.579
Did my hardware pick up
the signal that triggered it?

46:02.679 --> 46:04.631
Fortunately, yes.

46:04.731 --> 46:08.968
Unfortunately, the IP address I traced it to
is registered to the Valentine Corporation.

46:09.068 --> 46:12.038
That's not much of a lead.
He has millions of employees worldwide.

46:12.138 --> 46:14.172
That Richmond Valentine is a genius.

46:17.977 --> 46:20.881
Did you not see his announcement today?

46:20.981 --> 46:22.810
No.

46:25.971 --> 46:31.658
<i>We each spend on average $2,000 a year
on cell phone and Internet usage.</i>

46:31.858 --> 46:35.095
It gives me great pleasure to announce

46:35.195 --> 46:37.530
those days are over.

46:37.730 --> 46:42.986
As of tomorrow, every man, woman
and child can claim a free SIM card,

46:43.086 --> 46:46.774
compatible with any cell phone,
any computer,

46:46.897 --> 46:51.561
<i>and utilize my communications
network for free.</i>

46:51.661 --> 46:57.049
Free calls, free Internet for everyone.

46:57.441 --> 46:59.403
Forever.

47:14.534 --> 47:17.103
Valentine's assistant
has the same implant scar.

47:17.703 --> 47:20.338
I think Mr. Valentine and I
should have a tête-à-tête.

47:23.910 --> 47:26.489
He's having a gala dinner next week.

47:26.589 --> 47:29.282
I'll get you an invitation.
You need to be careful, though.

47:29.382 --> 47:31.551
Since you've been out,
hundreds of VIPs have gone missing.

47:31.651 --> 47:34.020
No ransom notes,
exactly like Professor Arnold.

47:34.320 --> 47:38.288
Then I suggest you make my alias
somebody worth kidnapping.

47:49.802 --> 47:52.272
Fuck, fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck.

47:52.372 --> 47:54.507
- What, don't like heights?
- Yeah, it's okay.

47:54.807 --> 47:58.276
I've done it before, which is...
probably why, come to think of it.

47:59.746 --> 48:03.114
Hey, it's gonna be all right.
You're top of the class.

48:05.251 --> 48:09.419
<i>Listen up. Your mission is to land in the
target withou the radar detecting you.</i>

48:09.519 --> 48:13.598
If I read you on the radar
or you miss the target, you go home.

48:13.698 --> 48:15.719
Is that understood?

48:18.348 --> 48:20.765
<i>Drop zone coming up, 20 seconds.</i>

48:22.268 --> 48:23.601
We got to go.

48:32.912 --> 48:34.881
Eggsy, I really don't
think I can do this.

48:34.981 --> 48:38.812
Of course you can't. Head to the back
and I'll show you how, yeah?

48:44.384 --> 48:45.859
Come on!

48:45.959 --> 48:49.004
Eggsy! Eggsy, wait! Hang on!

48:49.104 --> 48:51.958
Roxy, just stop fucking about!

48:52.165 --> 48:53.896
Follow me, yeah?

49:07.113 --> 49:09.461
Come on!

49:10.316 --> 49:12.248
<i>Roxy, it's now or never.</i>

49:13.627 --> 49:15.605
<i>Jump!</i>

49:33.373 --> 49:36.443
Good girl, Rox, I'm glad you made it!

49:43.883 --> 49:45.716
Yeah!

49:49.389 --> 49:50.991
Yeah!

49:51.691 --> 49:52.557
Come on!

49:55.261 --> 49:57.382
My, my, you're all very cheerful.

49:57.482 --> 49:59.699
Did you really think it was
gonna be that straightforward?

49:59.799 --> 50:02.135
Any idiot can read a heads-up display.

50:02.235 --> 50:06.439
A Kingsman agent needs to be able
to solve problems under pressure.

50:06.539 --> 50:09.941
Like what to do when one
of your group has no parachute.

50:11.384 --> 50:13.013
- What? No parachute?!
- Shit!

50:13.413 --> 50:15.515
- Who?!
- Fuck!

50:15.915 --> 50:18.318
- Which one?
- What do we do?!

50:18.418 --> 50:21.337
<i>I told you. Aim for the target.
Come in under the radar.</i>

50:21.437 --> 50:23.389
And I hope not to be
scraping one of you up.

50:23.889 --> 50:27.290
But if I do have to,
and you're inside the target,

50:27.390 --> 50:29.029
please know I'll be very impressed.

50:29.129 --> 50:30.912
- Fuck!
- Oh, shit!

50:34.467 --> 50:36.715
Everybody listen, I've got a plan!

50:37.570 --> 50:40.638
Pair off!
Grab the closest person to them.

50:43.409 --> 50:45.612
- Rufus, come on!
- Oh, fuck!

50:46.723 --> 50:49.655
- Rufus!
- Oh, shit! I can't!

50:53.119 --> 50:54.612
Fuck!

50:55.012 --> 50:56.139
Oh, thank God.

50:56.239 --> 50:57.989
<i>Rufus, you wanker!</i>

50:59.392 --> 51:01.469
Shit, we're an odd number now!

51:01.569 --> 51:05.429
- Quick, make a circle!
- Fuck, he's right! Boys, let's do it.

51:09.535 --> 51:11.504
We pull our cords one by one!

51:11.704 --> 51:15.273
When we know who's fucked,
the person on their right grabs them.

51:16.276 --> 51:17.877
Okay, Eggsy.

51:17.977 --> 51:21.214
Good plan, Eggsy. You have 30 seconds.
Come on now, hurry.

51:21.314 --> 51:22.413
Me first!

51:24.517 --> 51:27.251
Oh, fuck! Yes!

51:29.322 --> 51:31.656
Okay, me next.

51:33.621 --> 51:35.293
See you on the ground, boys.

51:39.165 --> 51:41.107
Now me.

51:44.020 --> 51:45.685
Fuck!

51:49.409 --> 51:52.797
Roxy, no matter what happens now,
I've got you, all right?

51:56.011 --> 51:57.198
Okay, Eggsy.

51:57.298 --> 51:59.695
- Yours first, okay?
- Yep.

52:11.338 --> 52:12.597
Oh, shit!

52:20.373 --> 52:21.605
Shit!

52:23.848 --> 52:25.198
Shit!

52:26.498 --> 52:28.079
Rox!

52:30.883 --> 52:32.016
Fuck.

52:48.434 --> 52:50.803
Hugo, Digby.

52:50.903 --> 52:53.773
You don't land in the K,
you're not in the K.

52:53.873 --> 52:57.644
Rufus, you opened too soon.
You were all over the radar.

52:57.744 --> 52:59.543
All three of you,
pack your bags, go home.

53:01.714 --> 53:05.885
Eggsy, Roxy, congratulations.
You set a new record.

53:05.985 --> 53:10.459
Opening at 300 feet, that's pretty ballsy.
Well done for completing another task.

53:10.559 --> 53:12.163
Fall out.

53:12.263 --> 53:15.128
Sorry, sir. But why the fuck
did you choose me as the gimp?

53:15.228 --> 53:19.226
- Am I the expendable candidate?
- No, no, no. You don't talk to me like that.

53:19.326 --> 53:23.165
You have a complaint, you come here
and you whisper it in my ear.

53:28.508 --> 53:31.539
You need to take that chip
off your shoulder.

54:02.125 --> 54:04.610
Mr. DeVere. It's a pleasure to meet you.

54:05.210 --> 54:07.847
I'm awfully sorry.
I seem to have my dates muddled up.

54:07.947 --> 54:10.983
Oh, no, no, no.
I canceled the gala because of you.

54:11.333 --> 54:14.948
Anybody willing to donate that much
deserves their own dinner.

54:15.048 --> 54:16.862
Come in.

54:16.962 --> 54:17.987
Thank you.

54:19.892 --> 54:22.643
Gotta admit, I was
really intrigued to meet you.

54:22.743 --> 54:24.379
There aren't many billionaires
I don't know.

54:24.479 --> 54:25.532
I don't doubt it.

54:25.632 --> 54:28.968
And, obviously, I had my people
look into your affairs,

54:29.068 --> 54:31.984
and that's some pretty old money
you're from. How'd your folks make it?

54:32.084 --> 54:35.405
Property, mostly.
Property and the markets.

54:35.505 --> 54:37.543
Nothing questionable,
if that's your concern.

54:37.643 --> 54:40.729
Look, I'm just into finding out
what caliber person you are.

54:40.829 --> 54:43.115
- I'm sure you understand that.
- I most certainly do.

54:43.215 --> 54:44.911
- Hope you're hungry.
- I'm famished.

54:45.011 --> 54:47.751
Good. Grab a seat.

55:08.806 --> 55:11.310
- I'll have the Big Mac, please.
- Great choice!

55:11.410 --> 55:14.817
But nothing beats two cheeseburgers
with secret sauce.

55:14.917 --> 55:17.863
- Goes great with this '45 Lafite.
- A classic pairing.

55:18.163 --> 55:22.109
And may I suggest Twinkies and a 1937
Château d'Yquem for pudding?

55:22.209 --> 55:24.717
I like it. So...

55:24.817 --> 55:27.993
you want to donate to my foundation.

55:28.093 --> 55:31.544
You are aware that I wound things down
in that area, right?

55:31.644 --> 55:34.633
Climate change is a threat
which affects us all, Mr. Valentine.

55:34.733 --> 55:37.820
And you're one of the few powerful men
who seems to share my concerns.

55:37.920 --> 55:40.739
No, I shut things down
because I wasn't getting anywhere.

55:40.839 --> 55:43.693
Every bit of research kept pointing
to the same thing.

55:43.793 --> 55:46.863
That carbon emissions are a red herring
and that we're past the point of no return,

55:46.963 --> 55:50.900
- no matter what remedial actions we take.
- Oh, you know your shit.

55:51.000 --> 55:56.839
I sometimes envy the blissful ignorance
of those less well-versed in the... shit.

55:57.532 --> 55:59.575
As Professor Arnold always said,

55:59.675 --> 56:02.185
"Humankind is the only virus
cursed to live

56:02.285 --> 56:05.485
with the horrifying knowledge
of its host's fragile mortality."

56:06.854 --> 56:09.250
You know, not a lot of people
knew about him.

56:12.021 --> 56:14.322
You like spy movies, Mr. DeVere?

56:18.063 --> 56:21.347
Nowadays they're all a little
serious for my taste.

56:21.447 --> 56:24.233
But the old ones... marvelous.

56:24.433 --> 56:26.869
Give me a far-fetched
theatrical plot any day.

56:26.969 --> 56:30.072
The old Bond movies! Oh, man!

56:30.172 --> 56:34.792
Oh, when I was a kid,
that was my dream job:

56:34.892 --> 56:36.927
gentleman spy.

56:37.027 --> 56:40.149
I always felt the old Bond films
were only as good as the villain.

56:40.549 --> 56:44.685
As a child, I rather fancied a future
as a colorful megalomaniac.

56:46.588 --> 56:49.823
What a shame we both had to grow up.

56:54.519 --> 56:55.606
Bon appétit.

56:58.292 --> 57:01.380
Just give me a couple of days
to think over your proposal.

57:01.480 --> 57:04.887
I'll have my people get in touch
with yours, and it's all good.

57:04.987 --> 57:09.202
And thank you for such a... happy meal.

57:13.715 --> 57:16.627
- Well, want me to follow him?
- Nah.

57:16.727 --> 57:19.339
I put a nano tracker gel in the wine.

57:19.439 --> 57:22.458
We'll know his every move
for the next 24 hours.

57:22.558 --> 57:25.161
Finally find out who he works for.

57:26.661 --> 57:28.809
Valentine didn't let me
out of his sight.

57:28.909 --> 57:32.185
All I got was this on the way in.

57:35.504 --> 57:39.288
South Glade Mission Church
is a hate group based in Kentucky.

57:39.388 --> 57:42.859
- FBI have been monitoring them for years.
- But you think Valentine is a supporter?

57:42.959 --> 57:46.416
No evidence yet of a direct connection,
but I'll keep looking.

57:47.216 --> 57:48.481
Oh, by the way,

57:48.581 --> 57:54.256
our ever-growing list of missing persons
now includes Scandinavian royalty.

57:54.356 --> 57:57.201
Royal Crown Princess Tilde.

57:58.943 --> 58:01.890
Just let me out, you psycho!

58:01.990 --> 58:04.999
I told you, you're free to go
any time you want,

58:05.099 --> 58:07.445
as long as you agree to my conditions.

58:07.545 --> 58:12.141
I don't agree, and I am never,
ever going to agree!

58:12.341 --> 58:13.576
Tough shit.

58:14.132 --> 58:15.978
Bitch.

58:16.979 --> 58:19.515
I want to speak to the British consul!

58:19.615 --> 58:21.908
<i>The list of missing celebrities
and dignitaries</i>

58:22.008 --> 58:23.786
<i>has continued to grow in recent weeks,</i>

58:23.886 --> 58:28.024
<i>and world leaders are coming under
increasing pressure to provide answers.</i>

58:28.124 --> 58:31.994
We are doing everything in our power
to find Princess Tilde.

58:32.094 --> 58:35.431
You know, governments
and security forces worldwide

58:35.531 --> 58:39.085
are working together to find the person
behind these abductions.

58:39.235 --> 58:42.663
<i>In other news, people all over the world
continue to wait in line</i>

58:42.763 --> 58:45.707
<i>day and night
to get their free SIM cards.</i>

58:45.807 --> 58:48.104
Mrs. P. You get one?

58:48.444 --> 58:50.997
Yeah. Yeah, I been queuing up all day.

58:51.097 --> 58:55.419
<i>This unprecedented giveaway
by the philanthropist Richmond Valentine</i>

58:55.649 --> 58:58.575
<i>has already seen
over a billion cards distributed.</i>

58:58.675 --> 58:59.620
At ease.

59:01.857 --> 59:04.160
So you thought we were done for the day?

59:05.060 --> 59:07.096
Well, we're not.

59:08.021 --> 59:11.250
- A party?
- Tonight, in London.

59:11.698 --> 59:13.229
- Who's this?
- Your target.

59:13.329 --> 59:16.261
Your mission is to use your NLP training

59:16.361 --> 59:18.808
to win over the individual
in the photograph in your envelope.

59:18.908 --> 59:22.378
And when I say "win over,"
I do mean in the biblical sense.

59:22.478 --> 59:23.579
Easy.

59:24.666 --> 59:26.723
Posh girls love a bit of rough.

59:26.823 --> 59:28.706
We'll see about that, yeah?

59:28.806 --> 59:31.110
We certainly will.

59:35.691 --> 59:40.306
Hi. Sorry, I just had to come over
and say, amazing eyes.

59:40.406 --> 59:42.899
- Are you wearing color contacts?
- No!

59:42.999 --> 59:45.584
- You so are.
- Oh, my God, negging!

59:45.684 --> 59:48.804
That's hilarious. I haven't heard anyone
try that since the noughties.

59:48.904 --> 59:51.097
- Excuse me?
- Negging.

59:51.197 --> 59:55.054
Saying something negative to a pretty girl
in order to undermine her social value.

59:55.444 --> 59:57.825
It's supposed to make you
want to win his approval.

59:57.925 --> 01:00:00.967
Absurdly basic, neuro-linguistic
programming technique.

01:00:01.067 --> 01:00:03.192
Is it just me, or does this champagne
taste a little bit funny?

01:00:03.292 --> 01:00:05.325
- It's an acquired taste, mate.
- I think it's just cheap.

01:00:05.425 --> 01:00:07.256
Get one of these instead.
They're delicious.

01:00:07.356 --> 01:00:10.311
You know, if you're into
seduction techniques, this guy is textbook.

01:00:10.411 --> 01:00:12.561
See what he just did?
It's called an opinion opener.

01:00:12.661 --> 01:00:14.505
He got you talking
with a neutral question,

01:00:14.605 --> 01:00:18.566
got all of us involved in the conversation,
so that you craved individual attention.

01:00:18.666 --> 01:00:20.370
No, I'm just saying
the champagne tastes rank.

01:00:20.470 --> 01:00:24.030
Lady Sophie Montague-Herring,
phone call for you at reception.

01:00:24.130 --> 01:00:25.763
- Be right back.
- We'll see you in a bit, yeah?

01:00:25.963 --> 01:00:27.359
See you in a bit.

01:00:27.459 --> 01:00:29.478
Budge up, Rox. I'm feeling a bit rough.

01:00:29.578 --> 01:00:31.046
- Are you all right?
- No.

01:00:31.146 --> 01:00:32.256
Sorry to eavesdrop, but, you know,

01:00:32.356 --> 01:00:35.885
there's a much easier way to guarantee
getting someone home.

01:00:36.185 --> 01:00:38.320
Rohypnol.

01:00:39.925 --> 01:00:42.992
Or even something stronger.

01:00:59.074 --> 01:01:00.810
Who the fuck are you?

01:01:01.448 --> 01:01:03.510
Where am I?

01:01:05.346 --> 01:01:08.582
This knife... can save your life.

01:01:13.018 --> 01:01:14.210
Fuck!

01:01:14.310 --> 01:01:17.126
My employer's got
two questions for you, Eggsy:

01:01:17.226 --> 01:01:21.096
What the fuck is Kingsman,
and who's Harry Hart?

01:01:21.196 --> 01:01:24.085
I don't know who the fuck that is! Shit!

01:01:24.185 --> 01:01:28.505
Eggsy, I just killed two of your friends
for giving me the same bullshit answer!

01:01:28.605 --> 01:01:32.274
Fuck! Just cut
the fucking ropes, please!

01:01:32.374 --> 01:01:35.044
Hey, Eggsy! Is Kingsman worth dying for?

01:01:35.644 --> 01:01:36.679
F...

01:01:37.179 --> 01:01:38.612
Fuck you!

01:01:53.056 --> 01:01:55.629
Congratulations. Bloody well done.

01:01:57.999 --> 01:01:59.817
How'd the others do?

01:01:59.917 --> 01:02:04.271
Roxy passed with flying colors.
Charlie's up next. Want to watch?

01:02:05.708 --> 01:02:07.740
Yeah, all right.

01:02:08.510 --> 01:02:09.679
Oh, fuck.

01:02:09.779 --> 01:02:11.747
Is Kingsman really worth dying for?

01:02:11.847 --> 01:02:15.417
No, it fucking isn't! Shit,
I'll tell you what you want. Please!

01:02:15.517 --> 01:02:16.937
Chester King is Arthur.

01:02:17.037 --> 01:02:19.635
Arthur's head of a spy agency...
it's called Kingsman. Get me out of here!

01:02:19.735 --> 01:02:22.488
Thank you, Charlie. Much appreciated.

01:02:22.588 --> 01:02:25.213
Come on! That wasn't the fucking deal!

01:02:25.313 --> 01:02:27.168
Fuck!

01:02:27.268 --> 01:02:28.662
Oh, fuck!

01:02:34.659 --> 01:02:39.225
I had such high hopes for you.
You're a bloody disgrace.

01:02:39.325 --> 01:02:42.228
Arthur, I'm sorry. At least untie me.

01:02:42.678 --> 01:02:43.944
Untie yourself.

01:02:45.681 --> 01:02:47.717
Arthur... Arthur, please.

01:02:49.088 --> 01:02:51.887
<i>I'm the fucking son of the... shit!</i>

01:02:51.987 --> 01:02:54.473
<i>Anyone? Hello?</i>

01:02:54.573 --> 01:02:57.026
Galahad, Percival, congratulations.

01:02:57.326 --> 01:03:00.262
Your candidates have reached
the final stage of the testing process.

01:03:00.362 --> 01:03:04.554
As tradition allows, you now have
24 hours to spend with them.

01:03:04.654 --> 01:03:08.351
Eggsy... you should know
your father reached this point.

01:03:08.451 --> 01:03:12.511
From now on, there are no
safety nets, understood?

01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:17.744
Good. Dismissed.

01:03:20.119 --> 01:03:22.284
Charlie, time to go home.

01:03:22.384 --> 01:03:24.320
Fuck you!

01:03:24.420 --> 01:03:26.470
Fucking Dad's gonna hear about this!

01:03:28.716 --> 01:03:30.693
"To pee or not to pee?"

01:03:30.793 --> 01:03:35.601
That was the headline the day after
I defused a dirty bomb in Paris.

01:03:36.036 --> 01:03:39.099
- "Germany - 1, England - 5."
- Missed that game.

01:03:39.199 --> 01:03:42.569
I was breaking up an undercover
spy ring at the Pentagon.

01:03:47.609 --> 01:03:51.947
My first mission. Foiled the assassination
of Margaret Thatcher.

01:03:52.047 --> 01:03:53.682
Not everybody'd thank you for that one.

01:03:53.782 --> 01:03:57.130
The point is, Eggsy,
nobody thanked me for any of them.

01:03:57.230 --> 01:04:00.946
Front page news on all these occasions
was celebrity nonsense.

01:04:01.046 --> 01:04:04.883
Because it's the nature of Kingsman
that our achievements remain secret.

01:04:04.983 --> 01:04:08.440
A gentleman's name should
appear in the newspaper only three times:

01:04:08.540 --> 01:04:10.961
when he's born, when he marries,
and when he dies.

01:04:11.061 --> 01:04:14.136
And we are,
first and foremost, gentlemen.

01:04:14.515 --> 01:04:16.782
That's me fucked, then.

01:04:16.882 --> 01:04:18.845
Well, it's like Charlie said...
I'm just a pleb.

01:04:18.945 --> 01:04:22.478
Nonsense. Being a gentleman has nothing
to do with the circumstances of one's birth.

01:04:23.587 --> 01:04:25.983
Being a gentleman
is something one learns.

01:04:26.083 --> 01:04:27.914
Yeah, but how?

01:04:28.932 --> 01:04:33.572
All right, first lesson. You should have
asked me before you took a seat.

01:04:33.672 --> 01:04:37.057
Second lesson.
How to make a proper martini.

01:04:38.027 --> 01:04:40.060
Yes, Harry.

01:04:42.764 --> 01:04:46.296
Goddamn it! This fucking hurts!

01:04:46.396 --> 01:04:48.737
You're the one who asked
for a biometric security system.

01:04:48.837 --> 01:04:51.203
- What's wrong with a simple switch?
- A simple switch?!

01:04:51.303 --> 01:04:55.248
This is an extremely dangerous machine.

01:04:55.348 --> 01:05:00.081
It should only be operated by someone
as responsible and sane as me.

01:05:00.181 --> 01:05:03.785
Bad shit can happen if this falls
into the wrong hands.

01:05:04.262 --> 01:05:07.189
Whoa! We done here? Shit!

01:05:07.289 --> 01:05:11.160
No. Now this one.
For the test at the church.

01:05:11.260 --> 01:05:14.828
This one just has a short range.
A simple switch will do.

01:05:20.902 --> 01:05:23.876
So are you gonna teach me
how to talk proper, like in My Fair Lady?

01:05:23.976 --> 01:05:28.113
Don't be absurd. Being a gentleman
has nothing to do with one's accent.

01:05:28.213 --> 01:05:30.712
It's about being at ease
in one's own skin.

01:05:30.812 --> 01:05:35.302
As Hemingway said, "There is nothing noble
in being superior to your fellow man.

01:05:35.402 --> 01:05:39.185
True nobility is being superior
to your former self."

01:05:42.672 --> 01:05:45.894
Now... first thing every gentleman
needs is a good suit.

01:05:46.094 --> 01:05:49.231
By which I mean, a bespoke suit.
Never off the peg.

01:05:49.331 --> 01:05:52.027
And Kingsman suits
are always bulletproof.

01:05:52.127 --> 01:05:54.696
So let's get you measured, and then,
whether you get the job or not,

01:05:54.796 --> 01:05:59.408
you'll have a lasting and... useful
memento of your time at Kingsman.

01:05:59.508 --> 01:06:03.312
I'm so sorry, sir, but a gentleman
is completing his fitting.

01:06:03.412 --> 01:06:05.581
Fitting room two is available.

01:06:05.681 --> 01:06:10.585
One does not use fitting room two
when one is popping one's cherry.

01:06:10.904 --> 01:06:15.293
Perhaps I'll show you
fitting room three while we wait.

01:06:24.041 --> 01:06:27.202
- So we going up or down?
- Neither.

01:06:27.891 --> 01:06:28.895
This it?

01:06:28.995 --> 01:06:31.899
Of course not.
Pull the hook on your left.

01:06:39.407 --> 01:06:42.616
Oh, yes. Very, very nice.

01:06:45.787 --> 01:06:48.457
Now, you're going to need a pair
of shoes to go with your suit.

01:06:48.557 --> 01:06:52.528
An Oxford is any formal shoe
with open lacing.

01:06:52.628 --> 01:06:55.864
This additional decorative piece
is called broguing.

01:06:56.064 --> 01:06:58.934
- "Oxfords, not brogues."
- Words to live by, Eggsy.

01:06:59.312 --> 01:07:01.837
Words to live by. Try a pair.

01:07:02.751 --> 01:07:05.241
Your weapon scores are excellent,
by the way.

01:07:05.341 --> 01:07:08.744
These you're familiar with.
And this is our standard-issue pistol.

01:07:08.944 --> 01:07:11.814
It's quite unique. As you'll see,
it also fires a shotgun cartridge

01:07:11.914 --> 01:07:14.116
for use in messy close-range situations.

01:07:14.416 --> 01:07:15.818
- How do they feel?
- Yeah, good.

01:07:15.918 --> 01:07:20.493
Now do your very best impersonation
of a German aristocrat's formal greeting.

01:07:22.743 --> 01:07:24.834
No, Eggsy.

01:07:27.863 --> 01:07:29.090
That is sick.

01:07:30.165 --> 01:07:32.289
In the old days, they had a phone
in the heel, as well.

01:07:32.389 --> 01:07:33.426
How do I get it back in?

01:07:33.526 --> 01:07:35.898
Well, it's coated in one
of the fastest-acting neurotoxins

01:07:35.998 --> 01:07:39.072
known to man, so... very carefully.

01:07:41.076 --> 01:07:42.293
Now...

01:07:42.393 --> 01:07:44.860
I've had a lot of fun with this.

01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:48.094
One of our finest examples
of chemical engineering.

01:07:48.194 --> 01:07:50.399
A poison... harmless when ingested,

01:07:50.499 --> 01:07:53.988
but at a time convenient to you,
can be...

01:07:54.088 --> 01:07:56.723
remotely activated. Primed.

01:07:58.537 --> 01:08:00.197
Lethal.

01:08:00.497 --> 01:08:02.524
And what about these? What do these do?

01:08:03.124 --> 01:08:04.917
- Electrocute you?
- Don't be ridiculous.

01:08:05.017 --> 01:08:06.702
- It's a hand grenade.
- Shut up.

01:08:06.802 --> 01:08:09.138
You want to electrocute someone,
you'll need a signet ring.

01:08:09.238 --> 01:08:11.540
A gentleman traditionally wears
the signet on his left hand,

01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:14.793
but a Kingsman wears it on whichever hand
happens to be dominant.

01:08:14.893 --> 01:08:17.510
Touch the contact behind the ring,
it delivers 50,000 volts.

01:08:19.180 --> 01:08:22.089
And what about them?
What makes them so special?

01:08:22.189 --> 01:08:25.953
Nothing. That technology's
caught up with the spy world.

01:08:27.104 --> 01:08:29.089
Put it back, Eggsy.

01:08:31.848 --> 01:08:35.162
Perfect timing.
Gentleman's just finished.

01:08:39.886 --> 01:08:42.500
Mr. DeVere!

01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:44.906
What a coincidence!

01:08:45.006 --> 01:08:47.776
You are totally the reason I am here.

01:08:48.076 --> 01:08:53.015
When you left my house, I was thirsting for
that dope-ass smoking jacket you had on,

01:08:53.115 --> 01:08:54.783
and since I'm going to Royal Ascot,

01:08:54.883 --> 01:08:56.970
and apparently you need one
of these penguin suits...

01:08:57.569 --> 01:09:00.255
here I am. What are you doing here?

01:09:00.555 --> 01:09:03.058
What's up, man? Richmond Valentine.

01:09:03.457 --> 01:09:06.428
This is my new valet.
I was just introducing him to my tailor.

01:09:06.528 --> 01:09:09.533
Another coincidence. So am I.

01:09:09.964 --> 01:09:12.090
Have you had any chance
to think further on my proposal?

01:09:12.189 --> 01:09:16.496
Most definitely. My people will be
getting in touch with you very soon.

01:09:16.595 --> 01:09:18.721
I guarantee it.

01:09:18.822 --> 01:09:19.975
A word of advice:

01:09:20.375 --> 01:09:22.678
Ascot requires top hat.

01:09:23.689 --> 01:09:26.715
I might suggest Lock & Co. Hatters.

01:09:27.612 --> 01:09:30.218
- St. James's.
- "Lox," as in smoked fish?

01:09:30.318 --> 01:09:32.736
As in "locked up."

01:09:35.957 --> 01:09:39.421
I have trouble understanding
you people sometimes.

01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:41.361
You all talk so funny.

01:09:48.482 --> 01:09:51.540
Gentlemen, would you look
after him, please?

01:10:04.252 --> 01:10:08.121
Now, this... is a dope-ass top hat.

01:10:09.290 --> 01:10:12.797
Gazelle! Let's go ascoting.

01:10:13.879 --> 01:10:18.733
<i>Your hat looks fine, Gazelle. Come on,
don't make me late for the queen.</i>

01:10:19.065 --> 01:10:21.736
<i>Come on, Gazelle, we're gonna be late.</i>

01:10:21.836 --> 01:10:24.838
<i>How far is Ascot? How far?</i>

01:10:28.937 --> 01:10:32.212
- Merlin said you wanted to see me, sir?
- Sit down.

01:10:37.418 --> 01:10:38.589
Pretty dog.

01:10:39.230 --> 01:10:41.523
- What's his name?
- J.B.

01:10:41.623 --> 01:10:43.925
- As in James Bond?
- No.

01:10:44.125 --> 01:10:47.763
- Jason Bourne?
- No. Jack Bauer.

01:10:49.931 --> 01:10:51.499
Bravo.

01:10:51.599 --> 01:10:53.095
It pains me to admit it, Eggsy,

01:10:53.195 --> 01:10:57.904
but I think that one day you might
be as good a spy as any of them.

01:11:04.677 --> 01:11:06.497
Take it.

01:11:12.985 --> 01:11:14.120
Shoot the dog.

01:11:21.029 --> 01:11:23.558
This weapon is live.

01:11:25.634 --> 01:11:28.110
Shoot the dog.

01:12:05.211 --> 01:12:07.589
Give me the gun.

01:12:17.501 --> 01:12:20.537
At least the girl's got balls.

01:12:23.010 --> 01:12:26.459
Get out. I knew you couldn't make it.

01:12:29.831 --> 01:12:31.877
Go home.

01:12:32.877 --> 01:12:35.402
Merlin, send in Roxy, please.

01:12:59.342 --> 01:13:03.363
Welcome... to Kingsman...

01:13:03.463 --> 01:13:05.348
Lancelot.

01:13:27.751 --> 01:13:30.225
- Mom?
- Eggsy!

01:13:30.425 --> 01:13:34.360
Oh, God, where have you been?
I've been so worried about you.

01:13:35.864 --> 01:13:39.103
Oh, my days, look how big you've grown.

01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:45.741
Where is he?

01:13:45.841 --> 01:13:48.655
I'm fine. Eggsy, please, please,
just don't get involved.

01:13:48.755 --> 01:13:50.812
Ma, I should never
have left you on your own.

01:13:50.912 --> 01:13:53.341
This stops right now.

01:13:53.441 --> 01:13:56.091
- I'll be right back.
- Eggsy...

01:13:58.715 --> 01:13:59.888
Oi! Dean!

01:14:00.788 --> 01:14:02.757
Oh, Mugsy. So you're back.

01:14:02.857 --> 01:14:04.823
What, you gone and nicked
a fucking taxi now?

01:14:04.923 --> 01:14:08.829
Yeah. Can I have a word
about my mum's black eye?

01:14:09.787 --> 01:14:11.513
You want to have a word with me?
You get out of that cab,

01:14:11.613 --> 01:14:14.623
I'll knock you straight
back down on your fucking arse.

01:14:15.436 --> 01:14:18.499
Tell your muppets to go inside,
then I'll get out.

01:14:19.799 --> 01:14:21.743
Go on, lads. There'll be two hits:

01:14:21.843 --> 01:14:23.812
me hitting him; him hitting the floor.

01:14:24.312 --> 01:14:27.652
Come on, then, you prick,
let's see what you got.

01:14:27.752 --> 01:14:29.463
Want a bit of me? What are you doing?

01:14:29.563 --> 01:14:31.853
- What the fuck? No, no! Come on!
- Get out of the fucking car!

01:14:31.953 --> 01:14:33.788
What are you doing?
What are you doing, you mug!

01:14:33.888 --> 01:14:35.156
Go on! You got no bollocks!

01:14:36.003 --> 01:14:37.959
Come on, bruv, he hit my fucking mum!

01:14:38.059 --> 01:14:40.460
Come back when you've grown
a pair! Mugsy!

01:15:03.580 --> 01:15:06.721
You throw away your biggest opportunity

01:15:06.821 --> 01:15:09.197
over a fucking dog.

01:15:09.750 --> 01:15:11.860
And then you humiliate me
by stealing my boss's car.

01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:14.229
You shot a dog
just to get a fucking job.

01:15:14.329 --> 01:15:16.413
Yes, I did.

01:15:18.825 --> 01:15:22.535
And Mr. Pickle here reminds me of that
every time I take a shit.

01:15:24.172 --> 01:15:28.176
You shot your dog and had it stuffed?
You fucking freak.

01:15:28.276 --> 01:15:31.504
No, I shot my dog, and then I brought him
home and continued to care for him

01:15:31.604 --> 01:15:34.705
for the next 11 years
until he died of pancreatitis.

01:15:34.805 --> 01:15:38.219
- What?!
- It was a blank, Eggsy.

01:15:38.619 --> 01:15:40.889
It was a fucking blank.

01:15:40.989 --> 01:15:43.191
- Remember Amelia?
- Yeah.

01:15:43.291 --> 01:15:44.496
She didn't drown.

01:15:44.596 --> 01:15:48.921
She works in our tech department in Berlin;
she's fine. Limits must be tested.

01:15:49.021 --> 01:15:51.666
A Kingsman only condones the risking
of a life to save another.

01:15:51.766 --> 01:15:54.969
Like my dad saved your life
even though your fuck-up cost his.

01:15:55.069 --> 01:15:56.586
Or have you got him
stuffed here and all?

01:15:58.778 --> 01:16:01.724
Can't you see that everything I've done
has been about trying to repay him?

01:16:07.609 --> 01:16:11.019
Harry, listen to this. Valentine's
at last saying something of note.

01:16:11.581 --> 01:16:13.822
<i>Know what I love about pen and paper?</i>

01:16:14.272 --> 01:16:16.691
Nobody can hack into this shit.

01:16:17.191 --> 01:16:20.661
Our worldwide tour
was a complete success.

01:16:20.761 --> 01:16:23.298
We... have total coverall.

01:16:23.398 --> 01:16:26.479
Like when all your numbers
in bingo are crossed out.

01:16:26.579 --> 01:16:29.739
- Bingo?
- Bingo. The game.

01:16:29.839 --> 01:16:33.351
- You have played bingo, right?
- Do I look like I play bingo?

01:16:35.743 --> 01:16:37.306
Point is...

01:16:37.406 --> 01:16:39.714
if our tests go well
at the church tomorrow,

01:16:39.814 --> 01:16:41.916
<i>we are good to go.</i>

01:16:42.016 --> 01:16:44.886
South Glade Mission Church.

01:16:45.486 --> 01:16:47.617
- Merlin, get the plane ready.
- <i>Will do.</i>

01:16:47.717 --> 01:16:50.507
- Harry, I'm so sorry. I'm gonna do ev...
- You should be.

01:16:50.607 --> 01:16:53.092
You just stay right there.
I'll sort this mess out when I get back.

01:16:59.659 --> 01:17:02.740
And I say to you, bear witness!

01:17:02.840 --> 01:17:07.423
Watch the news. Watch the news... AIDS!

01:17:07.523 --> 01:17:10.645
Floods! The blood
of the innocent spilled!

01:17:10.745 --> 01:17:16.615
And yet, there are those who doubt
this is the wrath of God.

01:17:17.652 --> 01:17:21.289
Our filthy government condones sodomy,

01:17:21.389 --> 01:17:24.359
divorce, abortion...

01:17:24.459 --> 01:17:27.153
and yet, some still doubt

01:17:27.253 --> 01:17:31.110
this is the work of the Antichrist!

01:17:31.210 --> 01:17:34.602
You do not have to be a Jew,
a nigger, a whore,

01:17:34.702 --> 01:17:38.940
Or a atheistic,
science-lovin' evolution spouter...

01:17:39.240 --> 01:17:40.775
<i>Charming sermon.</i>

01:17:41.075 --> 01:17:42.644
Can you see Valentine anywhere?

01:17:42.744 --> 01:17:45.747
So, my friends,
although he is a just God,

01:17:45.847 --> 01:17:48.649
he is justly a vengeful one,

01:17:48.749 --> 01:17:52.387
and there can be no turning back
from the Almighty...

01:17:52.487 --> 01:17:53.922
You sure we're out of range?

01:17:54.222 --> 01:17:55.724
We're over a thousand feet away.
What's wrong?

01:17:55.824 --> 01:17:58.891
- What if the calculations are wrong?
- You just have to trust me.

01:17:59.728 --> 01:18:02.756
...Jew, nigger, fag-lovers,

01:18:02.856 --> 01:18:06.388
and the Devil is burning them
for all eternity!

01:18:06.488 --> 01:18:08.392
Would you excuse me?

01:18:08.492 --> 01:18:11.740
Where are you going?
Hey. What's your problem?

01:18:13.465 --> 01:18:15.032
I'm a Catholic whore

01:18:15.132 --> 01:18:18.713
currently enjoying congress out of wedlock
with my black, Jewish boyfriend

01:18:18.813 --> 01:18:21.322
who works in a military abortion clinic.

01:18:21.913 --> 01:18:25.320
So, hail Satan, and have
a lovely afternoon, madam.

01:18:25.420 --> 01:18:27.889
...he may, in fact, use us...

01:18:28.832 --> 01:18:31.860
Oh, shit. He's leaving.
I'm starting the test now.

01:18:32.360 --> 01:18:34.460
Let's hope enough of these freaks
have our SIM cards.

01:18:37.750 --> 01:18:41.439
- Might I ask you to sit down, my friend!
- Just leave this church!

01:18:41.539 --> 01:18:43.903
You just leave this church
like the infidel you are!

01:18:46.457 --> 01:18:49.811
Satan cannot save you now!
You will eat your babies!

01:18:49.911 --> 01:18:53.516
You will drown in the blood of the Lord!

01:18:53.616 --> 01:18:56.919
He will not save you!

01:19:01.289 --> 01:19:03.556
Holy fuck!

01:19:03.891 --> 01:19:06.092
Shit, I can't watch this. Get over here.

01:19:48.236 --> 01:19:50.071
Geez! Fuck.

01:19:50.971 --> 01:19:53.024
<i>Galahad, can you hear me?</i>

01:19:53.674 --> 01:19:57.212
Harry! Harry, what the heck is going on?

01:19:58.512 --> 01:20:01.179
Could you turn the volume down, please?

01:20:01.279 --> 01:20:04.385
- I didn't expect it to be that effective.
- What kind of response are we talking?

01:20:05.485 --> 01:20:07.337
A hundred percent.

01:20:07.437 --> 01:20:10.391
So everyone's been affected,
whether they have a SIM card or not.

01:20:10.991 --> 01:20:13.761
And we get the added benefit
of wiping out the Kingsman.

01:20:13.861 --> 01:20:15.528
Not yet.

01:21:09.250 --> 01:21:10.285
Fuck!

01:21:10.485 --> 01:21:13.063
Oh, you need to see this.

01:23:08.954 --> 01:23:10.605
What did you do to me?

01:23:11.100 --> 01:23:13.207
I had no control.

01:23:14.067 --> 01:23:16.966
I killed all those people.

01:23:17.425 --> 01:23:19.747
- I wanted to.
- Clever, isn't it?

01:23:20.114 --> 01:23:22.901
In simple terms,
it's a neurological wave

01:23:23.001 --> 01:23:26.521
that triggers the centers of aggression
and switches off inhibitors.

01:23:26.621 --> 01:23:29.755
Transmitted through your nasty,
free SIM cards, I assume.

01:23:33.133 --> 01:23:35.205
Do you know what this is like?

01:23:35.305 --> 01:23:38.516
It's like those old movies we both love.

01:23:38.616 --> 01:23:40.837
Now I'm gonna tell you my whole plan,

01:23:40.937 --> 01:23:44.906
and then I'm gonna come up with some
absurd and convoluted way to kill you,

01:23:45.006 --> 01:23:47.942
and you'll find an equally
convoluted way to escape.

01:23:48.906 --> 01:23:50.378
Sounds good to me.

01:23:51.161 --> 01:23:53.870
Well, this ain't that kind of movie.

01:23:56.936 --> 01:23:59.359
No!

01:24:07.628 --> 01:24:09.393
Is he dead?

01:24:09.493 --> 01:24:11.866
That tends to happen
when you shoot someone in the head.

01:24:12.166 --> 01:24:13.362
It feels good, right?

01:24:13.462 --> 01:24:15.745
No, no, it does not feel good.
It feels fucking awful.

01:24:15.845 --> 01:24:19.280
What?! You just killed how many people
in that church? This is one guy.

01:24:19.380 --> 01:24:22.410
No, no, no, they killed each other.

01:24:24.448 --> 01:24:29.115
Okay, send out the countdown clock.
This party starts... tomorrow.

01:25:04.018 --> 01:25:06.033
Arthur?

01:25:07.441 --> 01:25:09.196
Are you there?

01:25:09.296 --> 01:25:11.292
<i>Sadly, I am.</i>

01:25:11.592 --> 01:25:15.059
Assemble the Kingsmen.

01:25:19.233 --> 01:25:23.436
<i>Can't you see that everything I've done
has been about trying to repay him?</i>

01:25:43.661 --> 01:25:45.860
<i>I see a young man with potential,</i>

01:25:46.722 --> 01:25:49.594
<i>who wants to do something good
with his life.</i>

01:26:06.097 --> 01:26:09.033
Arthur, Harry's dead.

01:26:09.133 --> 01:26:11.542
Galahad is dead.

01:26:11.642 --> 01:26:14.585
Hence, we have just drunk
a toast to him.

01:26:14.685 --> 01:26:17.364
Well, then you know
what that psycho's doing.

01:26:17.464 --> 01:26:20.176
How many people around the world
have got those SIM cards?

01:26:20.276 --> 01:26:22.764
Valentine can send his signal
to any of them, all of them.

01:26:22.864 --> 01:26:24.701
If they all go homicidal
at the same time, then...

01:26:24.801 --> 01:26:27.235
Indeed. And thanks
to Galahad's recordings,

01:26:27.335 --> 01:26:30.068
we have Valentine's confession.

01:26:30.168 --> 01:26:33.741
The intelligence has been passed on
to the relevant authorities.

01:26:33.841 --> 01:26:35.042
Our work is complete,

01:26:35.142 --> 01:26:40.180
and a most distinguished legacy
for our fallen friend, it is, too.

01:26:40.667 --> 01:26:42.929
And that's it?

01:26:43.029 --> 01:26:45.322
Come and sit down, boy.

01:26:47.371 --> 01:26:49.023
This...

01:26:49.123 --> 01:26:53.480
is an 1815 Napoleonic brandy,

01:26:53.580 --> 01:26:57.334
and we only drink it
when we lose a Kingsman.

01:26:57.434 --> 01:27:00.382
Galahad was very fond of you.

01:27:02.553 --> 01:27:07.518
And on this occasion,
I think it's acceptable for us...

01:27:07.618 --> 01:27:10.081
to bend the rules a little.

01:27:10.811 --> 01:27:14.915
- Are these all Kingsmen?
- Yes, they're... founder members.

01:27:16.015 --> 01:27:18.016
I want you to join me in a toast.

01:27:20.454 --> 01:27:22.156
To Galahad.

01:27:23.256 --> 01:27:25.139
To Galahad.

01:27:29.406 --> 01:27:32.460
Harry says you don't like
to break rules, Arthur.

01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:34.935
- Why now?
- You're very good, Eggsy.

01:27:35.035 --> 01:27:39.504
Perhaps I will make you my proposal
for Galahad's position.

01:27:39.604 --> 01:27:42.442
Provided, of course,
that we can see eye to eye

01:27:42.542 --> 01:27:45.652
on certain political matters.

01:27:47.534 --> 01:27:49.551
Can you guess...

01:27:50.150 --> 01:27:51.918
what this is?

01:27:52.018 --> 01:27:55.355
I don't have to; Harry showed me.
You click it, I die.

01:27:55.455 --> 01:27:58.638
I thought that brandy tasted a bit shit.

01:27:59.159 --> 01:28:00.474
Bravo.

01:28:00.574 --> 01:28:03.698
Valentine won you over... somehow.

01:28:03.798 --> 01:28:06.842
Once he explained, I understood.

01:28:06.942 --> 01:28:09.703
When you get a virus, you get a fever.

01:28:09.803 --> 01:28:13.874
That's the human body raising
its core temperature to kill the virus.

01:28:13.974 --> 01:28:16.310
Planet Earth works the same way.

01:28:16.410 --> 01:28:21.315
Global warming is the fever.
Mankind is the virus.

01:28:21.415 --> 01:28:26.687
We're making our planet sick.
A cull is our only hope.

01:28:26.787 --> 01:28:29.055
If we don't reduce
our population ourselves,

01:28:29.155 --> 01:28:31.825
there's only one of two ways
this can go.

01:28:31.925 --> 01:28:33.865
The host kills the virus,

01:28:33.965 --> 01:28:37.370
or the virus kills the host.
Either way...

01:28:37.470 --> 01:28:39.946
The result is the same.

01:28:40.046 --> 01:28:41.635
The virus dies.

01:28:42.735 --> 01:28:46.306
So Valentine's gonna take care
of the population problem himself.

01:28:46.406 --> 01:28:48.893
Well, if we don't do something,
nature will.

01:28:48.993 --> 01:28:54.081
Sometimes a culling is the only way
to ensure that this species survives.

01:28:54.181 --> 01:28:56.401
And history will see Valentine

01:28:56.501 --> 01:28:59.067
as the man who saved humanity
from extinction.

01:28:59.167 --> 01:29:02.589
And he gets to pick and choose
who gets culled, does he?

01:29:02.689 --> 01:29:05.459
All his rich mates, they get to live,
and anyone he thinks is worth saving,

01:29:05.559 --> 01:29:08.762
he's keeping them safe,
whether they agree with him or not.

01:29:08.862 --> 01:29:11.031
And you... Eggsy.

01:29:11.631 --> 01:29:13.734
In Harry's honor,

01:29:13.834 --> 01:29:18.703
I am inviting you
to be part of a new world.

01:29:20.626 --> 01:29:22.641
It's time to make your decision.

01:29:29.815 --> 01:29:33.105
I'd rather be with Harry. Thanks.

01:29:33.968 --> 01:29:35.925
So be it.

01:29:51.608 --> 01:29:54.909
The problem with us common types is...

01:29:55.009 --> 01:29:57.848
that we're light-fingered.

01:29:57.948 --> 01:30:00.915
Kingsman's taught me a lot, but...
sleight of hand...

01:30:01.568 --> 01:30:03.282
<i>Yes, they're... founder members.</i>

01:30:06.083 --> 01:30:08.586
...I had that down already.

01:30:09.747 --> 01:30:15.368
You dirty little fucking prick.

01:30:49.214 --> 01:30:51.920
It's okay, Lancelot. Put it down.

01:30:52.020 --> 01:30:54.326
It's verified.

01:30:55.918 --> 01:30:58.705
Arthur's phone is receiving update texts
about getting to safety...

01:30:58.805 --> 01:31:00.341
- we don't have a lot of time.
- What are you gonna do?

01:31:00.541 --> 01:31:02.861
Question is, what are we gonna do?

01:31:02.961 --> 01:31:06.207
God knows who's in
Valentine's pocket and who's not.

01:31:06.307 --> 01:31:08.819
We have no choice.

01:31:08.919 --> 01:31:10.882
We're gonna have to deal
with this ourselves.

01:31:14.354 --> 01:31:15.629
Follow me.

01:31:34.579 --> 01:31:38.345
- What the fuck is this?
- I have no idea.

01:31:39.030 --> 01:31:42.980
What you're playing with is a prototype
personal trans-atmospheric vehicle.

01:31:43.080 --> 01:31:45.419
It was developed as part of Reagan's
Star Wars project.

01:31:45.519 --> 01:31:48.489
It's pretty basic, but...
it should still work.

01:31:48.689 --> 01:31:50.991
We're gonna take out
one of Valentine's satellites.

01:31:51.491 --> 01:31:54.078
We're gonna break the chain,
stop the signal.

01:31:54.178 --> 01:31:56.329
It'll take him a couple of hours
to reroute it,

01:31:56.429 --> 01:32:00.327
which buys us enough time for you
to get me into Valentine's mainframe

01:32:00.427 --> 01:32:02.934
so I can shut it down.

01:32:03.034 --> 01:32:07.342
Lancelot, you're gonna be using it.
Get into your halo suit.

01:32:19.386 --> 01:32:22.392
<i>Swedish Prime Minister,
requesting permission to land.</i>

01:32:27.127 --> 01:32:29.073
<i>Permission granted.</i>

01:32:32.699 --> 01:32:35.035
- Please.
- Thank you.

01:32:35.135 --> 01:32:38.706
- So, how many more are we expecting?
- Not many. Most have their own bunkers.

01:32:39.006 --> 01:32:42.142
I figure we're just getting
the really nervous ones.

01:32:42.542 --> 01:32:45.078
Welcome, Prime Minister.

01:32:45.878 --> 01:32:49.182
It seems the implant can emit
some kind of counter signal

01:32:49.282 --> 01:32:52.777
to ensure the wearer remains unaffected
by the waves from the SIM cards.

01:32:52.877 --> 01:32:54.939
The waves that turn everyone
into a psycho killer.

01:32:55.039 --> 01:32:57.598
Quite. But what he probably
didn't tell anyone

01:32:57.698 --> 01:33:02.063
is it can also super-heat
their soft tissue at his command.

01:33:02.163 --> 01:33:06.626
Valentine selected his chosen few
to get the countdown warning,

01:33:06.726 --> 01:33:09.329
but he had to be sure they didn't blab
to the wrong people beforehand.

01:33:09.429 --> 01:33:12.200
How does this help us right now?

01:33:12.300 --> 01:33:14.900
It doesn't. Roxy! Here we go!

01:33:27.954 --> 01:33:31.458
The higher you go,
the more the balloons expand.

01:33:31.558 --> 01:33:35.746
When you reach the edge
of the atmosphere, they'll explode.

01:33:35.846 --> 01:33:38.029
You'll need to deploy your missile
just before that, okay?

01:33:38.129 --> 01:33:39.533
The edge of the atmosphere.

01:33:39.633 --> 01:33:42.770
Once you've deployed,
you'll need to release for descent fast.

01:33:43.870 --> 01:33:45.768
Good luck.

01:33:47.507 --> 01:33:49.376
- You can do this, okay?
- Yeah.

01:33:49.476 --> 01:33:52.277
Eggsy, come on! Time is not our friend.

01:34:15.082 --> 01:34:18.188
You're getting in on Arthur's invitation.
You're gonna need to blend in.

01:34:18.288 --> 01:34:22.145
- I'm supposed to be Arthur?
- His invitation's in his phone.

01:34:22.245 --> 01:34:24.971
Give them this.
Give his real name, Chester King.

01:34:25.071 --> 01:34:26.914
- What about you?
- I'm your pilot... I'm gonna stay here.

01:34:28.193 --> 01:34:31.785
- Is that gonna fit me?
- A bespoke suit... always fits.

01:34:32.185 --> 01:34:35.723
Just be grateful Harry
had it made for you. Get dressed.

01:34:37.343 --> 01:34:39.226
- What the fuck's wrong with them?
- I don't know.

01:34:39.326 --> 01:34:41.295
Could have something to do
with the mass genocide.

01:34:41.508 --> 01:34:43.598
Give me the mic.

01:34:45.232 --> 01:34:47.000
Hey-oh!

01:34:47.100 --> 01:34:50.103
Everybody, listen up! Hello, hello!

01:34:50.203 --> 01:34:52.239
What the fuck is wrong with you people?

01:34:52.539 --> 01:34:57.945
I just want to remind you
that today is a day of celebration.

01:34:58.962 --> 01:35:04.251
We must put aside all thoughts
of death and focus on birth.

01:35:05.451 --> 01:35:07.855
The birth of a new age.

01:35:09.129 --> 01:35:14.194
<i>We mustn't mourn those
who give their lives today.</i>

01:35:14.294 --> 01:35:16.163
<i>We should honor their sacrifice...</i>

01:35:16.263 --> 01:35:18.299
Has she got my number to call me back?
I got a new phone.

01:35:18.499 --> 01:35:22.614
<i>...and their roles
in saving the human race.</i>

01:35:24.071 --> 01:35:28.772
<i>We must put aside doubt and guilt.</i>

01:35:29.142 --> 01:35:33.981
You are the chosen people.

01:35:34.281 --> 01:35:37.017
When folks tell their kids
the story of Noah's Ark

01:35:37.117 --> 01:35:39.687
- is Noah the bad guy?
- No!

01:35:39.787 --> 01:35:42.756
- Is God the bad guy?
- No!

01:35:42.856 --> 01:35:45.508
How about the animals
marching two by two?

01:35:45.608 --> 01:35:48.352
- No!
- Of course not!

01:35:48.452 --> 01:35:53.934
Yeah, that's it! Let's turn
those frowns upside down.

01:35:54.034 --> 01:35:57.490
Eat, drink and party!

01:36:00.607 --> 01:36:04.637
And I will see you all in the new age.

01:36:28.601 --> 01:36:32.270
<i>Rox, it's me. How's the view?</i>

01:36:35.042 --> 01:36:37.227
- Hideous.
- <i>Mine's pretty sweet.</i>

01:36:37.427 --> 01:36:40.307
- They made you one of these suits yet?
- <i>No, not yet.</i>

01:36:40.407 --> 01:36:42.916
<i>You've got something
to look forward to then.</i>

01:36:43.016 --> 01:36:46.535
<i>We're coming up on Valentine's base.
Gotta go.</i>

01:36:47.087 --> 01:36:49.054
<i>Good luck.</i>

01:36:56.116 --> 01:36:58.737
Looking good, Eggsy.

01:36:59.610 --> 01:37:02.317
Feeling good, Merlin.

01:37:07.774 --> 01:37:12.076
This is November-2-4-7-Charlie-Kilo,
requesting permission to land.

01:37:14.847 --> 01:37:17.348
<i>Permission is granted.</i>

01:37:21.354 --> 01:37:23.777
Fuck me.

01:37:50.136 --> 01:37:52.417
Eggsy, we're on.

01:38:07.514 --> 01:38:09.282
Chester King.

01:38:09.382 --> 01:38:11.138
Mr. King, welcome.

01:38:11.638 --> 01:38:14.818
I'm sure you've adhered to Valentine's
strict no-weapons policy,

01:38:14.918 --> 01:38:16.844
- but if you don't object...
- Of course.

01:38:16.944 --> 01:38:18.777
Thank you.

01:38:18.877 --> 01:38:21.248
Do you have any luggage?

01:38:21.986 --> 01:38:25.859
Congratulations, Mycroft, you just
graduated from my pilot to my valet.

01:38:25.959 --> 01:38:28.288
- You cheeky...
- Understood?

01:38:28.688 --> 01:38:29.756
Good.

01:38:31.134 --> 01:38:32.986
Thank you.

01:38:58.151 --> 01:39:01.995
<i>Eggsy, find a laptop, get me online.</i>

01:39:02.095 --> 01:39:03.641
<i>The clock is ticking.</i>

01:39:03.741 --> 01:39:06.578
<i>And remember, try to blend in.</i>

01:39:06.678 --> 01:39:09.229
Would sir care for a drink?

01:39:09.329 --> 01:39:13.099
Martini. Gin, not vodka, obviously.

01:39:13.199 --> 01:39:17.213
Stirred for ten seconds while glancing
at an unopened bottle of vermouth.

01:39:17.313 --> 01:39:19.342
Thank you.

01:39:21.308 --> 01:39:23.076
Merlin, are you clocking this?

01:39:23.276 --> 01:39:25.879
Yes, I am. Stay focused.

01:39:25.979 --> 01:39:28.148
Lancelot, you're doing great.
Not much further to go.

01:39:28.848 --> 01:39:29.883
<i>Yes, Merlin.</i>

01:39:31.509 --> 01:39:33.720
<i>Eggsy, get me online now.</i>

01:39:34.777 --> 01:39:36.756
Yep, I'm on it.

01:39:36.856 --> 01:39:39.295
Lancelot, you're approaching
your altitude limit.

01:39:39.395 --> 01:39:41.992
<i>Those balloons won't last much longer.</i>

01:39:42.092 --> 01:39:44.305
<i>Prepare to engage missile.</i>

01:39:59.401 --> 01:40:03.339
Society's dead. Long live society.

01:40:03.950 --> 01:40:06.072
Amen to that.

01:40:06.654 --> 01:40:08.622
- I'm Morten Lindstrom.
- Chester King.

01:40:09.022 --> 01:40:10.457
How'd you get online? I couldn't.

01:40:10.557 --> 01:40:14.092
It's a closed network, you see.
Pre-authorized connections only.

01:40:17.821 --> 01:40:19.166
<i>I've got a fix on the satellite.</i>

01:40:19.266 --> 01:40:21.945
Do you have the correct time?
I think I'm still in my last time zone.

01:40:22.045 --> 01:40:24.627
Oh, yeah, yeah. Let's see now.

01:40:37.485 --> 01:40:39.753
Eggsy, I'm in. Get your arse
back to the plane, now.

01:40:39.853 --> 01:40:41.628
- <i>On my way.</i>
- Lancelot, good luck!

01:40:41.728 --> 01:40:43.821
Firing in three, two...

01:40:51.264 --> 01:40:53.733
- Nice and slow.
- Fuck are you doing here?

01:40:53.833 --> 01:40:57.804
Well, my family were invited, obviously.
Now, get the fuck up. Slowly.

01:40:58.604 --> 01:41:02.716
Oh, shit. Lancelot, hurry up and fire!
That other balloon is gonna blow!

01:41:02.816 --> 01:41:05.777
Yes, Merlin. I've nearly got it.
Give me a second!

01:41:07.847 --> 01:41:10.684
Valentine! I've caught a fucking spy!

01:41:11.416 --> 01:41:15.520
V-Glass, zoom.
Oh, fuck! It's that young valet.

01:41:18.751 --> 01:41:20.600
Son of a bitch.

01:41:20.700 --> 01:41:21.711
<i>Got it!</i>

01:41:31.879 --> 01:41:34.005
Oh, shit. Sound the alarm!

01:41:35.342 --> 01:41:36.780
I'm not taking any chances.

01:41:36.880 --> 01:41:39.718
Okay, you send out the two-minute warning.
I'm starting the override.

01:41:39.818 --> 01:41:41.052
All right, let's do this.

01:41:42.482 --> 01:41:44.990
<i>Countdown initiated.</i>

01:41:53.827 --> 01:41:55.426
- You see him?
- Right here.

01:42:04.371 --> 01:42:07.238
Eggsy, take a left.
Two guards, up ahead.

01:42:19.719 --> 01:42:22.009
Lancelot, release now!

01:42:31.998 --> 01:42:35.133
<i>Eggsy, straight ahead, then right.
There's two more.</i>

01:42:38.838 --> 01:42:42.289
All right, everybody on your feet!
Countdown to V-day!

01:42:42.389 --> 01:42:44.008
Welcome in the new age!

01:42:52.619 --> 01:42:54.706
Flat spin!

01:43:08.645 --> 01:43:11.398
<i>Eggsy, next left,
down the narrow tunnel!</i>

01:43:20.297 --> 01:43:21.358
Here we go!

01:43:21.458 --> 01:43:22.515
Ten,

01:43:23.215 --> 01:43:24.794
nine,

01:43:24.894 --> 01:43:26.718
eight,

01:43:26.818 --> 01:43:28.429
seven,

01:43:28.529 --> 01:43:30.073
six,

01:43:30.173 --> 01:43:31.658
five,

01:43:32.058 --> 01:43:34.894
four, three,

01:43:35.094 --> 01:43:36.630
two,

01:43:36.730 --> 01:43:38.153
one!

01:43:43.711 --> 01:43:45.472
Nice! Well done, both of you.

01:43:46.272 --> 01:43:50.074
It's not working! It's supposed
to be working! What the fuck?

01:43:56.363 --> 01:43:58.383
Yes! Well done, Rox. Good girl.

01:44:01.855 --> 01:44:04.403
We've lost one of our satellites.

01:44:14.033 --> 01:44:17.668
Oh, no, no. There's no way
I can hack past that.

01:44:23.447 --> 01:44:25.632
What's going on?

01:44:25.732 --> 01:44:27.616
Is there a problem?

01:44:27.716 --> 01:44:30.581
Come on, there's no need for guns.
I'm just a pilot.

01:44:33.584 --> 01:44:35.119
Fuck. Merlin!

01:44:37.483 --> 01:44:38.986
Get in here!

01:44:43.303 --> 01:44:45.430
Come on!

01:44:48.033 --> 01:44:50.453
- Let's get the fuck out of here!
- We can't.

01:44:50.553 --> 01:44:53.807
I can't get into Valentine's machine.
He's got biometric security.

01:44:55.394 --> 01:44:58.044
You're gonna have to get in there and make
sure his hand never touches that desk.

01:44:58.957 --> 01:45:01.813
- Are you taking the fucking piss?
- I'm afraid not.

01:45:05.408 --> 01:45:07.660
Let's have that then.

01:45:07.760 --> 01:45:11.300
This is mine. I'll show you yours.

01:45:28.980 --> 01:45:31.068
Good choice.

01:45:32.415 --> 01:45:35.315
- How long to re-link the satellite chain?
- It'll take an hour, maybe two.

01:45:35.415 --> 01:45:37.750
Bullshit! Just bring
these two closer together.

01:45:37.850 --> 01:45:40.594
But that's not yours.

01:45:44.792 --> 01:45:47.360
V-Glass, call E-man.

01:45:47.460 --> 01:45:48.647
E, it's V.

01:45:48.847 --> 01:45:51.965
Listen, man, I got a little hiccup
on this end. I need to piggyback.

01:45:52.165 --> 01:45:56.227
One of my satellites just went down,
but it's right next to one of yours.

01:45:56.790 --> 01:46:00.405
You read my mind. How long
before you make that happen?

01:46:03.543 --> 01:46:05.042
Go.

01:46:08.781 --> 01:46:10.681
All right, we should be
coming back online.

01:46:13.686 --> 01:46:15.727
Ten percent.

01:46:17.405 --> 01:46:21.168
Oh, shit! Eggsy, Valentine's using
someone else's satellite.

01:46:21.268 --> 01:46:24.697
<i>He's going to reconnect the chain.
It's going to take him no time at all.</i>

01:46:24.797 --> 01:46:27.350
It's at 20 percent.

01:46:44.308 --> 01:46:46.519
Eggsy, it seems Valentine's got
a present for you.

01:46:46.619 --> 01:46:48.611
<i>Get a move on!</i>

01:47:21.054 --> 01:47:24.223
- Is that Kingsman kid dead yet?
- Not yet, but he will be soon.

01:47:24.323 --> 01:47:26.090
Good.

01:47:38.991 --> 01:47:41.258
Merlin, I'm fucked.

01:47:53.169 --> 01:47:54.153
As am I.

01:47:54.253 --> 01:47:57.189
They're coming at me from both sides.
I'm out of options.

01:47:57.289 --> 01:48:00.089
Rox, Rox, I need a favor.

01:48:00.189 --> 01:48:02.929
Call my mum. Tell her
to lock herself away from Dean.

01:48:03.783 --> 01:48:07.131
And the baby, and...
tell her I love her.

01:48:15.409 --> 01:48:17.358
Oh, for fuck's sake.

01:48:21.880 --> 01:48:24.915
Merlin, remember those implants
you said were of no use to us?

01:48:26.819 --> 01:48:28.983
Any chance you can turn them on?

01:48:31.792 --> 01:48:34.899
All right. My turn to play, Valentine.

01:48:43.603 --> 01:48:46.205
Oh, oh, no!
No, no, what the fuck is he...

01:48:46.580 --> 01:48:48.711
I can't stop this.

01:49:00.886 --> 01:49:02.559
Yes, please.

01:49:05.425 --> 01:49:06.599
No!

01:50:03.515 --> 01:50:07.587
Oh, my God! That is fucking spectacular!

01:50:07.787 --> 01:50:10.723
Merlin, you're a fucking genius!

01:50:10.823 --> 01:50:14.103
What the fuck is happening out there?

01:50:18.354 --> 01:50:21.229
- Aren't you that princess who went missing?
- Can you get me out?

01:50:21.329 --> 01:50:24.792
If I do, will you give me a kiss?
I've always wanted to kiss a princess.

01:50:24.892 --> 01:50:27.974
If you get me out right now,
I'll give you more than just a kiss.

01:50:29.234 --> 01:50:32.489
<i>You motherfucker. Did you
really think I was stupid enough</i>

01:50:32.589 --> 01:50:34.808
<i>to implant one of those things
in my own head?</i>

01:50:35.208 --> 01:50:36.816
<i>What are you, fucking crazy?</i>

01:50:37.863 --> 01:50:41.016
All those innocent people killed,
and for what?

01:50:41.116 --> 01:50:44.578
You didn't stop shit!

01:50:45.218 --> 01:50:47.247
Yeah, fine, I've locked the door.
What do you want me to do now?

01:50:47.347 --> 01:50:50.163
As I said, put your daughter
in the bathroom and throw away the key.

01:50:50.984 --> 01:50:53.399
It's still happening!

01:50:53.499 --> 01:50:55.933
- You're fucking insane.
- <i>Just do it.</i>

01:51:23.095 --> 01:51:24.681
Eggsy, the signal's started!

01:51:24.781 --> 01:51:28.119
Get Valentine's hand
off that bloody desk now!

01:51:28.219 --> 01:51:30.533
Sorry, love. Gotta save the world.

01:51:31.958 --> 01:51:33.726
I'll be right back.

01:51:35.127 --> 01:51:36.119
Good luck!

01:51:42.902 --> 01:51:44.792
London.

01:52:12.377 --> 01:52:14.233
Rio!

01:52:29.717 --> 01:52:31.747
Get down!

01:52:32.351 --> 01:52:34.455
You did it!

01:52:42.569 --> 01:52:44.662
The glass is not gonna hold long.

01:52:46.298 --> 01:52:48.363
You stay here.

01:52:50.357 --> 01:52:51.671
Merlin, quickly, how do I get up there?

01:52:51.771 --> 01:52:53.604
- Keep shooting. I'll find a route.
- Understood.

01:53:10.239 --> 01:53:12.605
Holy fuck!

01:53:29.809 --> 01:53:31.043
We're back up!

01:53:32.064 --> 01:53:33.425
We're back up!

01:53:40.283 --> 01:53:41.952
This is great!

01:53:50.267 --> 01:53:54.432
- Eggsy! Fuckin' get on with it!
- Kick his ass, Gazy!

01:54:00.773 --> 01:54:03.541
Seoul, Caracas, Mumbai!

01:54:11.868 --> 01:54:14.318
Kill that motherfucker!
He killed all our friends!

01:54:31.207 --> 01:54:33.717
Eggsy... the world is going to shit!

01:54:43.115 --> 01:54:45.117
- Is he dead yet?!
- Not yet!

01:54:45.417 --> 01:54:48.873
Stop playing with your food! Kill him!

01:56:06.699 --> 01:56:08.800
Gazelle!

01:56:10.002 --> 01:56:11.813
Gazelle!

01:56:20.846 --> 01:56:23.601
Come on, come on!

01:56:25.481 --> 01:56:27.420
Kill him!

01:56:39.965 --> 01:56:42.010
Gazelle...!

01:56:43.772 --> 01:56:45.817
Hey-hey!

01:57:09.652 --> 01:57:10.961
<i>Well done, son!</i>

01:57:12.398 --> 01:57:14.700
Yes! Yes, Eggsy!

01:57:14.800 --> 01:57:18.005
Well done, Eggsy. And you, Lancelot.

01:57:20.606 --> 01:57:23.968
I'm so sorry.
Mummy would never hurt you.

01:57:24.068 --> 01:57:27.663
Mummy would never hurt you.
I'm so sorry.

01:57:29.879 --> 01:57:31.854
You okay?

01:57:34.420 --> 01:57:37.428
Harry would be proud of you, Eggsy.

01:57:37.528 --> 01:57:38.622
He was right.

01:57:54.073 --> 01:57:55.745
What's up, man?

01:57:55.845 --> 01:57:59.042
Is this the part where you say
some... really bad pun?

01:58:00.682 --> 01:58:02.546
Well, it's like you said to Harry.

01:58:05.851 --> 01:58:08.049
This ain't that kind of movie, bruv.

01:58:09.622 --> 01:58:11.721
Perfect.

01:58:31.918 --> 01:58:33.045
Eggsy, where are you going?

01:58:33.145 --> 01:58:35.279
There's no need for champagne.
We got loads in the plane.

01:58:42.688 --> 01:58:45.689
- Did you save the world?
- Yes, I did.

01:58:47.059 --> 01:58:49.762
So... you gonna come in?

01:58:50.727 --> 01:58:51.995
Yes, I am.

01:58:57.637 --> 01:58:59.469
Merlin, the cell's locked...
how do I get in?

01:59:01.873 --> 01:59:04.707
Twenty-six, twenty-five.

01:59:07.774 --> 01:59:10.914
Merlin... you're the guv'nor.

01:59:12.535 --> 01:59:15.048
<i>You owe me, Eggsy.</i>

01:59:20.460 --> 01:59:21.391
Eggsy?

01:59:27.566 --> 01:59:29.818
Oh, my word.

01:59:32.130 --> 01:59:35.306
<i>The storm is breaking</i>

01:59:35.581 --> 01:59:38.358
<i>Or so it seems</i>

01:59:38.727 --> 01:59:41.545
<i>We're too young to reason</i>

01:59:41.645 --> 01:59:44.605
<i>Too grown up to dream</i>

01:59:45.136 --> 01:59:48.815
<i>Now spring is turning</i>

01:59:48.915 --> 01:59:51.518
<i>Your face to mine</i>

01:59:51.618 --> 01:59:54.657
<i>I can hear your laughter</i>

01:59:54.757 --> 01:59:58.595
<i>I can see your smile
Slave to love</i>

02:00:02.625 --> 02:00:04.624
<i>Slave to love</i>

02:00:04.724 --> 02:00:07.689
<i>And I can't escape</i>

02:00:07.789 --> 02:00:11.753
<i>I'm a slave to love
Slave to love...</i>

02:00:16.582 --> 02:00:19.595
Michelle, turn that shit off.
It's doing my nuts in.

02:00:20.405 --> 02:00:24.121
I rather like that song.
Leave it on, Mum.

02:00:27.651 --> 02:00:29.570
Mugsy's back.

02:00:29.670 --> 02:00:32.386
You finally come to have that word
with me, have you, son?

02:00:32.486 --> 02:00:35.491
Or are you gonna run away again and pretend
you're going to court dressed like that?

02:00:35.901 --> 02:00:37.197
Oh, you mean this.

02:00:38.937 --> 02:00:40.786
No.

02:00:40.886 --> 02:00:43.976
I know this bloke who's just taken over
a tailor's shop on Savile Row.

02:00:45.030 --> 02:00:47.011
He's given me a job, Mum.

02:00:47.480 --> 02:00:50.024
Comes with a lot of perks.

02:00:50.149 --> 02:00:52.722
Including a house.

02:00:52.822 --> 02:00:55.387
Come and live with me there, Mum.
Come on.

02:00:56.249 --> 02:00:58.290
Sit down, you.

02:00:58.390 --> 02:01:01.084
Only place she'll be visiting is you
in fucking hospital. Do you hear?

02:01:01.184 --> 02:01:04.888
Just leave him alone, Dean!
Eggsy, go. Please, just go, babe.

02:01:06.565 --> 02:01:09.558
- All right.
- Yes, do as Mummy says.

02:01:09.658 --> 02:01:12.354
Why don't you ask that tailor friend of
yours to knock up a nice chicken costume...

02:01:12.454 --> 02:01:14.969
it'd suit you, you mug.

02:01:16.520 --> 02:01:18.944
As a good friend once said...

02:01:20.182 --> 02:01:21.378
"Manners...

02:01:23.482 --> 02:01:25.451
"maketh...

02:01:27.046 --> 02:01:28.632
man."

02:01:28.832 --> 02:01:31.040
- Hey...
- Shut the fuck up.

02:01:31.290 --> 02:01:35.324
Eggsy, I'm gonna shove
your manners up your fuck...

02:01:39.659 --> 02:01:43.102
So... are we gonna stand
around here all day,

02:01:43.202 --> 02:01:45.406
or are we gonna fight?

02:01:56.518 --> 02:01:59.251
<i>Get ready for it</i>

02:02:10.653 --> 02:02:13.918
<i>You said whatever you put out there</i>

02:02:14.018 --> 02:02:18.658
<i>Whatever you put out there
is gonna come back</i>

02:02:18.758 --> 02:02:22.065
<i>You said whenever you are ready</i>

02:02:22.165 --> 02:02:26.744
<i>Whenever you are ready
just let it all out</i>

02:02:26.844 --> 02:02:30.263
<i>And I know 'cause the enemy inside me</i>

02:02:30.363 --> 02:02:34.925
<i>'Cause the enemy inside me
is holding me back</i>

02:02:35.025 --> 02:02:38.557
<i>But we know
there's something in the silence</i>

02:02:38.657 --> 02:02:41.556
<i>There's something in the silence</i>

02:02:41.656 --> 02:02:44.170
<i>Get ready for it</i>

02:02:49.897 --> 02:02:52.436
<i>Get ready for it</i>

02:02:58.055 --> 02:03:02.095
<i>You said there's only one place
left to find</i>

02:03:02.195 --> 02:03:06.298
<i>Together we can save the world tonight</i>

02:03:06.398 --> 02:03:08.076
<i>Get ready for it</i>

02:03:08.176 --> 02:03:11.329
<i>You said every life is a lesson</i>

02:03:11.429 --> 02:03:13.429
<i>Are you a fool or a Kingsman?</i>

02:03:13.529 --> 02:03:16.239
<i>'Cause only you know</i>

02:03:16.339 --> 02:03:19.595
<i>Hold on 'cause the volume is rising</i>

02:03:19.695 --> 02:03:24.242
<i>Yeah, the volume is rising
so you better hold on</i>

02:03:24.878 --> 02:03:26.850
<i>The night is young</i>

02:03:26.950 --> 02:03:30.912
<i>Until it's over, until it's over</i>

02:03:31.012 --> 02:03:32.922
<i>The night is young</i>

02:03:33.022 --> 02:03:35.030
<i>The night is ours</i>

02:03:35.130 --> 02:03:39.105
<i>Until tomorrow, until tomorrow</i>

02:03:39.205 --> 02:03:41.758
<i>Get ready for it</i>

02:03:46.944 --> 02:03:49.905
<i>Yeah, get ready for it</i>

02:03:55.549 --> 02:03:59.599
<i>You said there's only one place
left to find</i>

02:03:59.699 --> 02:04:03.793
<i>Together we can save the world tonight</i>
