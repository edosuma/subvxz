WEBVTT

00:16.280 --> 00:18.960
We will see
if the Gods chose right.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
The Veran got his witch back.

00:22.520 --> 00:24.080
This is for you.

00:24.120 --> 00:25.800
Then there's my girl.

00:25.840 --> 00:28.720
If she keeps it up...
...We're in.

00:28.760 --> 00:30.120
The Chosen One.

00:30.160 --> 00:32.880
Veran doesn't think she's got this.

00:34.560 --> 00:36.800
Our prophecies
are made for this.

00:36.840 --> 00:40.560
They're coming in ways
we cannot see. They've got us.

00:41.400 --> 00:43.240
You want
that spear so badly,

00:43.280 --> 00:46.320
it makes you do diabolical things.

00:46.360 --> 00:47.960
She won't take you again.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.080
I'm not just yours...

00:50.120 --> 00:52.480
I belong to her now.

00:52.520 --> 00:54.400
If we fail, that's the end.

01:00.360 --> 01:01.560
What?

01:01.600 --> 01:02.920
It's a trap.

01:02.960 --> 01:04.800
Get her!

01:10.680 --> 01:13.720
Come on. I've got you.

01:51.440 --> 01:54.000
Surrender to Lokka.

01:54.040 --> 01:56.600
You haven't got a chance...

01:56.640 --> 01:58.840
Ania.

02:01.640 --> 02:03.720
Oh, no.

The General?

04:26.720 --> 04:28.800
You've got blood in your hair.

04:55.400 --> 04:57.360
I know who you saw.

05:13.880 --> 05:15.560
Follow the coaches.

05:16.920 --> 05:18.560
Open the gates.

05:21.760 --> 05:23.400
Legionaries!

05:29.880 --> 05:31.680
Halt!

05:41.480 --> 05:43.320
Perfect.

05:57.120 --> 05:58.520
You went against the plan!

05:58.560 --> 06:00.680
Deny it. All along
you've had your own agenda.

06:00.720 --> 06:04.000
I gave you my bow! To save her! You
tried to kill their general instead!

06:04.040 --> 06:05.880
Oh, bullshit.
Yeah. This is them.

06:05.920 --> 06:08.120
This is the Regni all over.
You fucking saw nothing.

06:08.160 --> 06:10.080
You were too busy
falling off a fucking wagon.

06:10.120 --> 06:12.320
We've had three centuries of this.
And I did save her.

06:12.360 --> 06:14.600
Oh, really? Anyone else see that?

06:14.640 --> 06:16.280
Dad, I forgive you for everything!

06:17.360 --> 06:19.080
At least now we know
why you're here.

06:20.240 --> 06:24.480
You have no idea why I'm here,
you zealous little shitbag.

06:24.520 --> 06:27.560
Your pathetic plan
and your piss-poor prophecy.

06:27.600 --> 06:31.080
I'm bored now. I don't need this.

06:31.120 --> 06:35.880
You can shove your spear
up your shitter. Sideways.

06:35.920 --> 06:37.400
I'm out.

06:37.440 --> 06:39.560
Out of my way. Nipple!

06:41.240 --> 06:43.360
Where's she going?

06:43.400 --> 06:46.440
What happened?
Let her go. She had no faith!

06:48.840 --> 06:50.640
So where's the girl?

06:50.680 --> 06:52.320
She was here just after dawn.

07:00.960 --> 07:03.480
You're certain?
It's her.

07:03.520 --> 07:05.640
What's up with you?
I can't see it.

07:05.680 --> 07:09.120
I should be able to see the signs
and find the signs...

07:16.160 --> 07:17.360
Who's she with?

07:18.240 --> 07:20.120
Ania.

07:22.360 --> 07:23.920
Well, you better tell him.

07:25.600 --> 07:27.800
Yep. Yep, OK. There's, there's...

07:27.840 --> 07:29.840
..something I should
probably have mentioned.

07:29.880 --> 07:33.000
Oh, I don't like this.
Uh, I know Ania pretty well...

07:33.040 --> 07:34.800
Actually, I don't, but I did.

07:34.840 --> 07:36.880
To be fair, even then
I didn't know her that well.

07:36.920 --> 07:38.880
I knew she was
a fucking basket-case.

07:38.920 --> 07:41.160
Stick to the point, Kwunt.
Yeah.

07:41.200 --> 07:43.640
I've looked into her eyes a lot.

07:43.680 --> 07:46.320
We had a baby together.
So I know her pretty well.

07:46.360 --> 07:48.320
But when I looked
into her eyes last night,

07:48.360 --> 07:51.920
it was like... she wasn't there.

07:51.960 --> 07:54.400
What do you mean?
Something else was.

07:54.440 --> 07:56.640
Something else was what?
In her.

07:56.680 --> 08:00.680
In her?
Like... controlling her.

08:02.120 --> 08:04.160
And you didn't think
you'd mention that?

08:04.200 --> 08:07.160
You didn't think that,
on this mission, this,

08:07.200 --> 08:10.640
the most sacred of sacred tasks
in recorded time, you'd...

08:10.680 --> 08:13.520
-Yeah.
-Thanks for bringing
that one to the team.

08:13.560 --> 08:17.920
Thanks for sharing that absolutely
fucking crucial input.

08:20.520 --> 08:25.480
But, as usual, my dim, ginger
penance-for-I-know-not-what,

08:25.520 --> 08:27.520
I'm way ahead of you.

08:27.560 --> 08:30.600
Ania's a rat. She's the traitor.

08:35.040 --> 08:36.800
Drella's dead.

08:36.840 --> 08:39.120
Oh.
She fell off the viaduct, splat.

08:39.160 --> 08:40.360
Awful.

08:47.200 --> 08:50.000
This way?

09:13.080 --> 09:15.320
For four moons
the Cimbri pinned us down.

09:15.360 --> 09:18.520
We toiled day and night to
dig a tunnel to the treeline.

09:18.560 --> 09:22.840
Two hundred passed through it, to
rise unseen behind their siege line.

09:22.880 --> 09:24.840
The Cimbri charged.

09:24.880 --> 09:28.880
Dozens on both sides were slain.
By dawn, but 20 were standing.

09:28.920 --> 09:31.080
We captured their Chieftain.
Igborn the Dread.

09:31.120 --> 09:33.240
It's Ogborn, you cunt!

09:33.280 --> 09:37.200
Well, it sounds like,
um, quite a dust up.

09:38.040 --> 09:40.520
The, er, Cimbri will be back,
but with reinforcements...

09:40.560 --> 09:41.800
Can I stop you there?

09:41.840 --> 09:44.440
On behalf of the Emperor,
I command your valiant efforts.

09:44.480 --> 09:46.280
But this is what's
gonna happen, OK?

09:46.320 --> 09:48.160
You're gonna tell... Ogborn?

09:48.200 --> 09:50.040
You're gonna tell
our friend there,

09:50.080 --> 09:54.680
that if he accepts a truce,
pulls back, cools off his boots,

09:54.720 --> 09:58.560
then, by the next New Moon,
this entire valley will be his.

09:59.600 --> 10:01.520
What?
What the fuck?

10:01.560 --> 10:03.560
You fought like lions!

10:03.600 --> 10:06.160
But the battle, my friends...

10:07.440 --> 10:09.640
..is not the war.

10:40.320 --> 10:42.000
Hold that thought.

10:55.520 --> 10:58.200
It's not what I'm used to,
but I suppose it'll do.

10:58.240 --> 10:59.840
My apologies, General.

10:59.880 --> 11:02.840
It's an honour to cede my quarters
to General Aulus Plautius...

11:02.880 --> 11:05.240
Yes. Well, that will be
all for now. Thank you.

11:07.120 --> 11:08.760
And Centurion...
Aye, General.

11:08.800 --> 11:11.600
Tell them to keep a lid on it out
there, will you, that's a good man.

11:11.640 --> 11:13.200
Aye, General.

11:21.120 --> 11:23.400
So, what's the plan, Father?

11:25.040 --> 11:27.600
I think we're beyond that now,
don't you?

11:28.960 --> 11:31.360
What do you mean?
Why do you call me Father?

11:31.400 --> 11:33.400
I'm not your father.

11:33.440 --> 11:37.800
My boy is dead, and I watched him
die. So come on...

11:38.800 --> 11:40.600
Who are you?

11:41.800 --> 11:43.720
When did you guess?

11:47.040 --> 11:48.640
I'm right, aren't I?

11:50.120 --> 11:52.840
Well, you always were a clever one.

11:54.920 --> 11:58.040
At the heart of the madness,
he comes...

12:03.480 --> 12:05.480
Mighty Lokka.

12:07.080 --> 12:09.040
My Master.

12:40.600 --> 12:43.040
If you ask me,
it just doesn't add up.

12:43.080 --> 12:45.800
Ania's devout. She's the best
novice I've ever met.

12:45.840 --> 12:47.600
No offence.
None taken.

12:47.640 --> 12:49.320
I know it's her.
How?

12:49.360 --> 12:52.040
Because she tried to hex me.
When?

12:52.080 --> 12:55.000
A few days back.
Ania tried to hex you?

12:55.040 --> 12:58.600
Alright, I tried to hex her.
But it didn't work and then...

12:58.640 --> 13:00.120
..she hexed me.
Oh!

13:01.840 --> 13:04.240
I was tired! I had a lot on my mind.

13:04.280 --> 13:07.480
The fact remains, she hexed me
and she took Big Pebble.

13:07.520 --> 13:11.560
Fuck! You lost Big Pebble?
Yes, I...

13:13.880 --> 13:16.920
If I had Big Pebble,
we wouldn't be in this mess.

13:18.280 --> 13:21.600
Cait's my responsibility.
From the beginning.

13:21.640 --> 13:25.040
I found her. I schooled her
on the path to righteousness.

13:25.080 --> 13:27.800
Nobody acknowledges that.
Nobody comes up to me and says,

13:27.840 --> 13:32.120
"Hey, Divis! Hey... Arrow..."

13:34.000 --> 13:35.920
Now she's gone.

13:35.960 --> 13:38.360
And right when I need
Big Pebble the most.

13:38.400 --> 13:41.520
I could ask Danu, Aarogh,

13:41.560 --> 13:43.120
Morrigan.

13:43.160 --> 13:45.120
I could move
the fucking stars around.

13:45.160 --> 13:47.200
She was stronger. Ania.

13:48.880 --> 13:51.360
She was stronger than Big Pebble.

13:52.520 --> 13:54.360
She was stronger than you.

13:59.760 --> 14:00.960
Fuck.

14:15.320 --> 14:17.640
Where are we going?

14:18.800 --> 14:21.560
No idea.

14:21.600 --> 14:23.160
Oh!

14:28.960 --> 14:30.280
Oh!

14:44.600 --> 14:46.960
How's that?

14:47.000 --> 14:49.960
Feels good being here.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.200
With you.

14:52.240 --> 14:54.080
Same here.

15:01.080 --> 15:03.720
Hello. What's this?

15:03.760 --> 15:05.560
Where's the road?

15:05.600 --> 15:07.960
I guess this is as far
as the Romans have got.

15:12.200 --> 15:13.560
Who's that?

15:19.440 --> 15:21.360
Afternoon.

15:24.920 --> 15:27.920
Who are you?

15:27.960 --> 15:30.600
I asked first.
We're Druids.

15:30.640 --> 15:32.840
We're Druids. He's...

15:35.040 --> 15:37.760
None of you are Druids!

15:37.800 --> 15:41.000
This road slays the trees,

15:41.040 --> 15:44.040
cleaves the fields,
murders the meadow flowers -

15:44.080 --> 15:48.520
no true Druid would walk
the Path of The Demons.

15:48.560 --> 15:50.400
Well, he's got a point there.

15:50.440 --> 15:53.120
It's quite handy though.
Straightest line between two points.

15:54.720 --> 15:56.640
Stay here. I'll look for tracks.

15:59.320 --> 16:01.040
Why are you tied to that chair?

16:01.080 --> 16:03.840
I have been chosen.

16:05.320 --> 16:09.560
To be sacrificed to Cernunnos,

16:09.600 --> 16:11.880
The Hornèd One.

16:11.920 --> 16:15.600
I shall drink from the Cup of Light,

16:15.640 --> 16:18.320
be split from neck to naval,

16:18.360 --> 16:20.240
my offal strewn to the wind,

16:20.280 --> 16:23.680
whereupon Cernunnos
shall descend from the heavens,

16:23.720 --> 16:29.200
rip up the Demon Path, gather up
the stones, and drive the invaders

16:29.240 --> 16:32.680
back, back, back into the sea.

16:34.480 --> 16:38.480
Sounds unmissable.
To be chosen for sacrifice

16:38.520 --> 16:41.240
is the highest honour in my tribe.
Mm.

16:41.280 --> 16:44.680
My three wives each get a goat.

16:44.720 --> 16:46.280
Couldn't be happier for you.

16:47.280 --> 16:49.400
Look, you don't wanna do this.

16:49.440 --> 16:50.800
No, no, don't, don't untie me!

16:50.840 --> 16:53.520
They're gonna spilt you
from your neck to your waist!

16:53.560 --> 16:55.440
Do not untie me! Do not untie me!
No. No!

16:55.480 --> 16:58.600
Hey, hey, hey.

17:01.200 --> 17:03.360
Shut up. Calm down. Calm down.

17:03.400 --> 17:05.040
Calm down. You can't stay here.

17:05.080 --> 17:06.480
What is it?

17:06.520 --> 17:08.920
Let's get out of here.

17:26.160 --> 17:29.000
We told you 10 fucking times.
We're Druids!

17:29.040 --> 17:32.040
They were on the Path of the Demons!

17:32.080 --> 17:34.080
We were looking for someone.
We're in a hurry.

17:34.120 --> 17:38.520
The straightest line between two...
If you are a Druid...

17:41.720 --> 17:43.600
What is this?

17:43.640 --> 17:45.880
That's easy...
Not you.

17:48.080 --> 17:49.560
Him.

17:49.600 --> 17:51.040
Oh shit.

17:51.880 --> 17:54.240
Sorry, guys.
We're on a sacred mission!

17:54.280 --> 17:57.040
Look. We know who built the road.
We hate the road.

17:57.080 --> 18:00.840
If you hate the road, then prove it.

18:00.880 --> 18:03.800
As a Druid, you will know how.

18:06.600 --> 18:08.960
Oh no.

18:13.200 --> 18:14.400
Wooo!

18:20.080 --> 18:22.440
Woooo!

18:27.600 --> 18:31.360
Oh, Daddy!

18:31.400 --> 18:35.320
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah!

18:35.360 --> 18:37.040
How are we doing?

18:37.080 --> 18:38.480
I can't feel my legs.

18:39.600 --> 18:43.080
I can't feel anything
south of my tits.

18:43.120 --> 18:45.520
Oh, Daddy!

18:45.560 --> 18:47.400
It's, uh, pretty strong.

18:47.440 --> 18:49.240
Call yourself a Druid?

18:49.280 --> 18:51.400
Obviously it's strong!

18:51.440 --> 18:54.200
The secret is to control it.

18:54.240 --> 18:56.240
Get up on top of it.

18:56.280 --> 18:58.440
And pause it!

18:59.480 --> 19:02.520
Boss the stone. Boss the stone.
Oh, Daddy!

19:02.560 --> 19:05.400
Ignore the giant bats.

19:05.440 --> 19:07.160
This is why I'm here.

19:07.200 --> 19:09.840
This is my calling.

19:09.880 --> 19:11.360
You know what, chum?

19:13.480 --> 19:16.520
It probably is.

19:51.840 --> 19:53.680
No.

19:59.280 --> 20:00.480
No.

20:01.880 --> 20:04.000
No. No.

20:07.680 --> 20:08.880
No.

20:13.240 --> 20:20.760
Stop the road!

20:23.640 --> 20:26.800
Stop the road!

20:27.840 --> 20:30.040
Yay!

20:30.080 --> 20:32.880
Me next. It's me next.

20:32.920 --> 20:35.720
Oh! Yes, please.

20:35.760 --> 20:38.080
Oh, this is it. This is it.

20:38.120 --> 20:39.400
This is it!

20:39.440 --> 20:42.960
Your blood shall be the road!

20:43.000 --> 20:47.400
Where it flows, the Gods walk!

21:15.280 --> 21:18.440
Which way did the Romans go?

21:18.480 --> 21:20.960
There's a valley. Ten miles west.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.320
It's Cimbri land.

21:23.360 --> 21:26.320
There's a Roman fort. It's...

21:34.800 --> 21:36.920
Leave me for the crows, eh?

22:06.760 --> 22:08.800
Hang on.

22:08.840 --> 22:11.720
I know who this is.
Who is it?

22:11.760 --> 22:14.920
"My name's Veran.

22:14.960 --> 22:17.920
"You are the Chosen One."

22:17.960 --> 22:21.600
"You will do as I say!"

22:23.120 --> 22:25.120
"I want your child."

22:25.160 --> 22:28.720
You want my only child? Here.

22:28.760 --> 22:30.160
Take him!

22:34.480 --> 22:37.000
I've given him my whole life.

22:37.040 --> 22:38.680
My soul.

22:39.840 --> 22:41.520
It's alright. It's alright.

22:41.560 --> 22:45.280
But this journey
has made me feel like...

22:46.080 --> 22:47.880
I'm wrong again.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.800
There's another power.

22:53.840 --> 22:57.280
Power much stronger.

22:58.800 --> 23:00.960
Fiercer.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.200
More wholly,

23:03.240 --> 23:05.520
wholly pure.

23:19.480 --> 23:21.960
Do you love me?
Oh, to the moon and back.

23:22.000 --> 23:26.040
Will you never leave me?
Never. Come. Dance with me.

23:26.080 --> 23:28.920
Whoo!

23:28.960 --> 23:30.880
Yes!

23:34.160 --> 23:35.360
Yeah.

23:42.560 --> 23:44.320
Everybody. Everybody, come on.

23:44.360 --> 23:47.000
Come on. Come on!

23:51.720 --> 23:55.120
Come on. One, two, three.

23:55.160 --> 23:59.880
Die!

24:02.680 --> 24:06.040
Well, die. Die - lie down.

24:07.200 --> 24:09.200
Come on.

24:10.200 --> 24:13.000
Aah! Yes. Ha ha!

24:13.040 --> 24:14.840
Come on. Let's go.

24:14.880 --> 24:16.400
Oh, yeah. Let's go.

24:17.880 --> 24:19.640
Come on.

24:35.920 --> 24:39.040
The time has come.

24:52.120 --> 24:54.800
You see, that's how it works.

24:55.600 --> 24:58.520
We take your fear and, and your loss,

24:58.560 --> 25:01.000
and we turn it up
until it's pure madness.

25:01.040 --> 25:03.720
Pushes you and pushes you...

25:03.760 --> 25:06.560
..until you lose yourself,

25:06.600 --> 25:08.000
and eventually you go pop.

25:09.680 --> 25:11.280
And there...

25:11.320 --> 25:15.000
..in the clear, pure pop
of insanity, you find it.

25:16.600 --> 25:18.800
Then you're ready.

25:20.440 --> 25:22.320
Sacrifice.

25:23.440 --> 25:25.960
It's the gift that keeps on giving.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.280
Hem, what was your sacrifice?

25:29.360 --> 25:31.480
Who says I've made one yet?

25:44.200 --> 25:46.480
He's downstairs.

26:08.360 --> 26:11.160
Hmm.

26:12.160 --> 26:13.800
Hmm.

26:15.040 --> 26:17.040
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

26:17.080 --> 26:19.680
Oh!

26:19.720 --> 26:21.480
There!

26:21.520 --> 26:23.120
Hmm.

26:27.560 --> 26:29.800
Shall we?

26:40.840 --> 26:43.520
Here! Up the hill!

27:08.760 --> 27:11.000
Fuck off.

27:15.560 --> 27:17.840
Perhaps I should've asked...

27:18.880 --> 27:20.920
..Where's the spear?

27:20.960 --> 27:22.160
Hmm?

27:26.960 --> 27:29.240
So...

27:29.280 --> 27:30.480
Lucius Validus.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
Lucius the Strong.

27:35.040 --> 27:36.880
Lucius the Worthy.

27:38.760 --> 27:41.320
When do the ghosts come for you?

27:43.600 --> 27:46.320
The baby you speared in its cot.

27:47.320 --> 27:52.040
The mother who begged you
to rape her to spare her daughter.

27:53.360 --> 27:55.960
The boys you tore limb from limb

27:56.000 --> 27:59.440
so their father would know
the might of Rome.

28:02.560 --> 28:05.920
So much blood...

28:05.960 --> 28:08.640
..so much horror...

28:08.680 --> 28:12.520
..so much to try and forget.

28:12.560 --> 28:16.160
Who wouldn't crave
a way out from under?

28:16.200 --> 28:19.000
And you found it, didn't you?

28:20.560 --> 28:25.120
You saw your chance and you took it.

28:25.160 --> 28:27.480
All that horror wasn't your fault.

28:27.520 --> 28:29.080
It was your divine destiny.

28:30.360 --> 28:32.480
Had to be.

28:32.520 --> 28:34.720
You're a saved soul.

28:35.640 --> 28:37.520
And the ghost thing,
they disappear.

28:37.560 --> 28:39.840
Stop!

28:39.880 --> 28:41.520
Please.

28:43.520 --> 28:45.560
You're right.

28:46.520 --> 28:49.480
I'm a coward. A monster.

28:52.200 --> 28:55.280
I escaped by killing a man.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.440
Like hundreds before him.

29:01.520 --> 29:03.480
Except...

29:05.840 --> 29:08.200
..he wasn't a man.

29:12.160 --> 29:14.280
And when he came to me again...

29:16.720 --> 29:19.960
..He had a promise in his eyes.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.480
A light.

29:22.520 --> 29:27.480
Something I wanted so badly.

29:30.200 --> 29:32.960
Something you...

29:33.000 --> 29:35.880
..will never understand.

30:09.880 --> 30:12.000
Forgiveness.

30:29.000 --> 30:33.440
Being a girl
is the best thing in the world.

30:33.480 --> 30:36.960
Woo!

30:43.360 --> 30:45.440
Don't be scared.

30:45.480 --> 30:47.440
You have wings.

30:47.480 --> 30:49.880
CYRUS,
One of them will betray you.

31:01.000 --> 31:03.160
Are you there, Lokka?

31:04.840 --> 31:07.360
Mighty Lokka!

31:07.400 --> 31:09.640
Are you there?

31:09.680 --> 31:12.160
I am here.

31:12.200 --> 31:14.960
Your journey is complete.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.680
I am within you.

31:20.520 --> 31:23.200
Let go now. Peace awaits.

31:36.000 --> 31:37.840
No!

31:45.560 --> 31:48.040
No, no, no!

31:51.600 --> 31:54.000
You are strong, sister.

31:54.040 --> 31:57.200
The legions of the dead
are behind you.

31:57.240 --> 31:59.680
They are chanting your name.

31:59.720 --> 32:02.360
Your move, Cait.

32:15.600 --> 32:16.800
No!

32:24.160 --> 32:26.880
Nooo!

32:54.960 --> 32:57.320
-Where you going?
-To see
an old friend, chop off his head.

32:57.360 --> 32:59.120
Oh, no, you don't.
Oh, yes, I do. Look,

32:59.160 --> 33:01.720
she doesn't win, we don't win.
So let's call it a draw.

33:01.760 --> 33:05.360
You really don't get this, do you?
This is exactly what he wants.

33:05.400 --> 33:07.800
This is his sacrifice.
Just like his master.

33:09.240 --> 33:12.040
She thinks she's got us.

33:12.080 --> 33:14.680
Oh!

33:14.720 --> 33:17.280
Let her come.

33:19.680 --> 33:21.680
One of them will betray you.

33:22.520 --> 33:27.400
Oh, my master.

33:28.480 --> 33:30.520
My master.

33:46.480 --> 33:47.960
Wait for me.

33:50.400 --> 33:52.400
It is the Gods' will.

34:05.360 --> 34:08.000
What now? What happens next?

34:08.040 --> 34:10.280
The girl must die.

34:10.320 --> 34:12.360
So the world can live.

34:12.400 --> 34:16.320
The prophecy...
The Chosen One is returned!

34:16.360 --> 34:19.440
I see...
It is her.

34:19.480 --> 34:21.240
I took his spear.
The prophecy...

34:25.680 --> 34:28.320
You are the one. It's you.

34:46.640 --> 34:48.400
Welcome.

34:53.040 --> 34:54.560
Take her!

34:56.760 --> 34:58.480
Epona.

34:58.520 --> 35:00.880
Taranais.

35:00.920 --> 35:02.320
Sulis.

35:02.360 --> 35:05.400
Morrigan. Maddoch.

35:05.440 --> 35:08.720
In the name of all the Gods
who stand behind me...

35:08.760 --> 35:12.160
..I command you to kneel.

35:12.200 --> 35:14.320
Beautiful.
Enough!

35:14.360 --> 35:16.120
Take her now!

35:16.160 --> 35:17.680
Kneel!

35:26.000 --> 35:28.040
Fire!
Oof!

35:35.800 --> 35:40.200
Fire!

35:40.240 --> 35:42.720
Get to the ramparts!

35:48.000 --> 35:49.200
Find her!

35:53.520 --> 35:56.360
Wait! Step back!

36:04.160 --> 36:06.560
Return fire! Return...

36:40.720 --> 36:42.120
Wait!

36:45.880 --> 36:47.800
My queen.

37:11.640 --> 37:13.440
Are you sure that you want to know?

37:22.120 --> 37:24.600
Find it. It's yours.

37:24.640 --> 37:27.080
Carry it forward. Go.

37:28.320 --> 37:30.000
Now.

37:30.040 --> 37:31.840
Turn around, little bird.

37:32.840 --> 37:34.040
Go!

37:34.080 --> 37:35.440
Aah.

37:35.480 --> 37:39.280
The power you carry
will light the world.

37:42.600 --> 37:46.800
Oh, come, come!

37:46.840 --> 37:50.280
Don't be shy. Don't be afraid.

37:56.320 --> 37:58.880
Come.

37:58.920 --> 38:00.680
Find the girl!

38:02.080 --> 38:03.760
Come on!

38:06.320 --> 38:08.720
Aah!

38:45.400 --> 38:47.280
This way. Hurry.

39:03.800 --> 39:06.560
The counter-attack was
final. The enemy are routed.

39:06.600 --> 39:08.720
They're fleeing, sir.

39:08.760 --> 39:10.600
General.

39:16.520 --> 39:18.160
Whoa, there.

39:25.160 --> 39:27.000
It's too late.

39:31.320 --> 39:33.880
It's too late.

39:38.320 --> 39:42.560
