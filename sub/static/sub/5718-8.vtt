WEBVTT

00:04.672 --> 00:06.840
Hey, what you
filming there, D-Rex?

00:06.907 --> 00:08.376
I have to do
a video project

00:08.442 --> 00:10.411
on our family's
Thanksgiving traditions.

00:10.478 --> 00:11.612
So, what are they?

00:11.679 --> 00:13.514
Thanksgiving's in two days.

00:13.581 --> 00:15.383
Weren't you gonna
talk to him about
not procrastinating?

00:15.449 --> 00:16.750
Yeah, yeah.
I'll get to it.

00:18.886 --> 00:21.289
Well, Dave,
this is the
first Thanksgiving

00:21.355 --> 00:24.325
we're having at our house
with all your grandparents,

00:24.392 --> 00:26.026
so everything's
gonna be new.

00:26.094 --> 00:27.828
It was supposed to be
about traditions.

00:27.895 --> 00:29.263
That doesn't help me
at all.

00:29.330 --> 00:31.532
Forget it. I'll just
deal with this tomorrow.

00:31.599 --> 00:32.800
Hey, Dave.

00:32.866 --> 00:34.135
When you put things off
till the last minute,

00:34.202 --> 00:36.504
you get such
an adrenaline rush.

00:40.974 --> 00:42.276
Okay, do you have
the list I gave you

00:42.343 --> 00:43.644
to pick up the stuff
for the dinner?

00:43.711 --> 00:45.413
Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:45.479 --> 00:47.481
Got it right here.

00:47.548 --> 00:50.484
Is that a blank piece
of paper because
you lost the list?

00:50.551 --> 00:52.286
Nope, not blank,
I wrote some
scribbles on it

00:52.353 --> 00:54.355
to make it look like words
from a distance.

00:55.389 --> 00:57.191
MOLLY: Dave!

00:57.258 --> 00:58.426
What happened?

00:58.492 --> 01:00.361
I walked in
on Molly getting dressed.

01:00.428 --> 01:01.862
(SIGHS)

01:01.929 --> 01:04.165
Dave, when a girl...
I got this.

01:05.899 --> 01:08.902
Dave, when a girl
is blossoming
into womanhood,

01:08.969 --> 01:10.571
never look at her.

01:10.638 --> 01:12.273
It's gross.

01:13.307 --> 01:14.975
I didn't see her naked.

01:15.042 --> 01:17.311
Then what's wrong?
Molly has a tattoo.

01:17.378 --> 01:18.812
What?

01:18.879 --> 01:21.882
And not
that anyone's asking me,
but, man, is it tacky.

01:28.489 --> 01:30.891
It's the Japanese symbol
for "wisdom."

01:33.026 --> 01:36.264
Molly, we always say
we want you to learn
by making your own mistakes.

01:36.330 --> 01:39.066
But we don't mean it.
(SIGHS) Exactly.

01:39.133 --> 01:41.535
It's just a hollow
parenting expression.

01:41.602 --> 01:43.837
Like "we're not angry.
We're just disappointed."

01:43.904 --> 01:47.275
Yeah,
we're always angry.

01:47.341 --> 01:50.611
It's not a big deal.
A lot of my friends
have gotten tattoos.

01:50.678 --> 01:53.414
Oh, really? Have a lot
of your friends jumped
off the Brooklyn Bridge?

01:55.115 --> 01:56.517
No.

01:59.853 --> 02:00.988
Good.

02:03.757 --> 02:06.059
Look, I'm really sorry,
okay?

02:06.126 --> 02:07.928
(SIGHS) Mol,
an apology is not enough.

02:07.995 --> 02:10.764
There's a permission issue
here, and you
didn't have ours.

02:10.831 --> 02:12.233
(SIGHS)

02:12.300 --> 02:14.835
No screens for a month.
No laptop, no TV,
no phone.

02:14.902 --> 02:17.271
So you're cutting me off
from my friends?

02:17.338 --> 02:19.307
This month,
you have one friend.

02:19.373 --> 02:21.108
His name is Dave Park,

02:21.175 --> 02:23.644
which brings
his friend total
to one, as well.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.048
A tattoo?
Are you kidding me?

02:28.115 --> 02:30.117
That's
a gateway rebellion.

02:30.184 --> 02:31.885
I mean, soon, she'll have
face piercings,

02:31.952 --> 02:34.188
those things
that stretch out
your earlobes,

02:35.256 --> 02:36.657
ties to the underworld.

02:36.724 --> 02:37.958
What underworld?

02:38.025 --> 02:39.627
Oh, like she's gonna
tell us.

02:41.395 --> 02:43.964
Why would she choose a tattoo
of a Japanese character?

02:44.031 --> 02:45.599
(SCOFFS)

02:45.666 --> 02:48.836
Wait. Is your issue
the tattoo or the fact
that it's Japanese?

02:48.902 --> 02:50.338
Both.

02:50.404 --> 02:52.373
But I think we know
who to blame
for the Japanese part.

02:53.641 --> 02:55.609
What?
Oh, come, now.

02:55.676 --> 02:58.246
You've always pushed
your Japanese agenda

02:58.312 --> 03:00.248
onto the kids, huh?

03:00.314 --> 03:01.849
Trying to "Japanify" them

03:01.915 --> 03:04.718
with your field trips to
Little Tokyo and your edamame.

03:04.785 --> 03:05.919
You even rented Godzilla.

03:05.986 --> 03:07.120
You told me to!

03:07.187 --> 03:08.722
You said you wanted
to see San Francisco

03:08.789 --> 03:10.824
"get what it deserves."

03:10.891 --> 03:13.627
Well, what about
those Hello Kitty
folders, huh?

03:13.694 --> 03:15.296
Dave likes Hello Kitty.

03:15.363 --> 03:16.764
I'm not gonna apologize

03:16.830 --> 03:19.199
that our kids identify
with their
Japanese background.

03:19.267 --> 03:21.769
Maybe you've forgotten,
but our kids
are half-Korean, too.

03:21.835 --> 03:24.104
And you could have taught them
about their Korean heritage,

03:24.171 --> 03:25.973
but it wasn't
important to you.

03:26.039 --> 03:27.174
You're a lapsed Korean.

03:27.241 --> 03:28.742
(GASPS)

03:30.811 --> 03:32.946
Lapsed Korean?

03:33.013 --> 03:34.815
Let's face it. Culturally,
you have more in common

03:34.882 --> 03:37.551
with the white teenage girls
at the mall.

03:37.618 --> 03:39.152
Hey, I shop at Forever 21

03:39.219 --> 03:42.155
because their men's
extra-small fits me perfectly.

03:42.222 --> 03:43.857
Okay.

03:43.924 --> 03:45.559
Forgot my edamame.

03:47.728 --> 03:49.029
Bye, Dave.

03:49.096 --> 03:50.264
(SPEAKING KOREAN)

03:55.369 --> 03:56.937
(SPEAKING KOREAN)

03:57.004 --> 03:59.507
Uh, yeah.
That's Korean
for "goodbye."

03:59.573 --> 04:01.742
Actually,
that's Korean for "hello."

04:01.809 --> 04:03.677
Oh, good for you.
Congratulations.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.779
Great. Great.
Whoo-hoo!

04:08.882 --> 04:11.485
Then she had the nerve
to tell me
I'm a lapsed Korean.

04:11.552 --> 04:12.820
Can you believe that?

04:12.886 --> 04:15.889
Hell yeah. I have a VCR
that's more Korean than you.

04:16.990 --> 04:18.359
Clark,
you've known me forever.

04:18.426 --> 04:20.528
How Korean
would you say I am?

04:20.594 --> 04:23.997
Well, you know,
I'm post-racial
and colorblind

04:24.064 --> 04:27.067
and also confused
by the question.

04:27.134 --> 04:30.070
But if you whisper
to me the answer
you are looking for,

04:30.137 --> 04:32.139
you shall get it, sir.

04:32.205 --> 04:33.874
I am super-Korean.

04:33.941 --> 04:36.410
Yes, you are.

04:36.477 --> 04:38.879
I am! Look, my parents
moved here from Korea.

04:38.946 --> 04:40.648
My dad started
a Korean school,

04:40.714 --> 04:41.949
where I learned
about my culture

04:42.015 --> 04:43.717
and how
not to control my temper!

04:44.785 --> 04:46.420
Ah. Small talk.

04:46.487 --> 04:47.788
Uh, let's see.
Let's see.

04:47.855 --> 04:50.958
Ooh! I saw Natalie Merchant
at a Panda Express
last night.

04:51.024 --> 04:53.761
(CHUCKLES)
Your turn.

04:53.827 --> 04:56.564
Oh, we were talking about
how Korean Dr. Ken is.

04:56.630 --> 04:59.099
Whoa, whoa.
A little sensitivity.

04:59.166 --> 05:00.834
Dr. Ken is Chinese.

05:02.135 --> 05:03.871
I'm Korean!

05:03.937 --> 05:06.674
That's the spirit.

05:06.740 --> 05:09.777
Well, due to
unforeseen circumstances

05:09.843 --> 05:11.111
with my boyfriend,
Topher...

05:11.178 --> 05:12.713
Whoa, wait.
I thought that was over.

05:12.780 --> 05:14.648
Oh, no.
We were on again.

05:14.715 --> 05:16.016
But then
he broke up with me

05:16.083 --> 05:18.151
because he said
I lacked self-confidence.

05:18.218 --> 05:21.121
Like this is really
gonna help.
(CHUCKLES)

05:21.188 --> 05:23.824
Anyway, I would love
to invite all of you

05:23.891 --> 05:26.326
to my Thanksgiving day
orphans dinner.

05:26.394 --> 05:29.397
I know it's really
last-minute, but I hope
that you can come.

05:29.463 --> 05:33.467
It's gonna be
the party of the year!
(CRYING)

05:33.534 --> 05:34.802
Oh, sorry.

05:34.868 --> 05:37.137
Uh, we're having family over,
so I can't make it.

05:37.204 --> 05:40.508
But I want you to know,
if that wasn't the case,

05:40.574 --> 05:44.011
my mind would be racing
to come up
with any other excuse.

05:47.247 --> 05:50.217
Pat? I know
you're also newly single.

05:50.283 --> 05:51.985
Indeed I am.

05:52.052 --> 05:56.089
And I'll be spending
my first solo turkey day
at the sportsmen's lodge.

05:56.156 --> 05:59.560
Yeah, that place
is gonna be lousy
with drunken, needy women.

05:59.627 --> 06:00.828
(CHUCKLES)

06:00.894 --> 06:02.930
Let's just say there'll be
two kinds of stuffing.

06:04.465 --> 06:06.500
That was a double entendre.
I'm not sure if it landed.

06:06.567 --> 06:09.369
But the important thing is,
I'm hoping to have sex.

06:09.437 --> 06:10.738
(CHUCKLES)

06:12.406 --> 06:13.507
Guys?

06:14.708 --> 06:16.209
Oh.
We'll be there.

06:16.276 --> 06:17.445
Oh! Yay!

06:17.511 --> 06:18.812
BOTH: Yay!

06:18.879 --> 06:20.448
Hope no one's
allergic to fun!

06:20.514 --> 06:21.582
BOTH: No.

06:22.416 --> 06:24.184
Oh-ho.

06:24.251 --> 06:25.453
"We'll be there?"

06:25.519 --> 06:27.455
I felt bad.
We'll just stop by.
(SIGHS)

06:27.521 --> 06:29.457
Okay, but I'm supposed
to be with my family.

06:29.523 --> 06:31.992
This is the first Thanksgiving
since my grandma passed.

06:32.059 --> 06:33.360
Oh. When did she die?

06:33.427 --> 06:35.663
No. She's alive.
She just passed
on the invite,

06:35.729 --> 06:37.798
so it actually might be fun
this year.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.769
Okay, so just go after.
I have plans, too.

06:41.835 --> 06:44.071
My friends and I have
this whole turkey
trot thing.

06:44.137 --> 06:45.506
You're doing a run?

06:45.573 --> 06:48.308
Oh, no, no, no.
It's a dance party
at a bar in west Hollywood.

06:48.375 --> 06:50.310
Then there's an after-party
which goes until 2:00,

06:50.377 --> 06:51.812
and then an
after-after party, which...

06:51.879 --> 06:54.448
Okay, Clark. I get it.
It's fun to be gay.

06:54.515 --> 06:56.183
Okay, remember
when you were a kid

06:56.249 --> 06:57.651
and you were so excited
to go to Disneyland?

06:57.718 --> 07:00.187
It's like that for me
every day, but gay.

07:07.995 --> 07:09.497
Oh, my God.

07:09.563 --> 07:12.065
There's a Hells Angel
mixer in our living room!

07:12.132 --> 07:14.101
Oh. It's just
our tattooed daughter.

07:15.503 --> 07:16.970
What are you doing?

07:17.037 --> 07:18.906
Since you and mom
took away all my screens,

07:18.972 --> 07:20.474
I'm faxting with Tammy.

07:20.541 --> 07:22.776
Faxting?
Texting
with Mom's fax machine.

07:41.795 --> 07:44.297

to find a loophole.

07:44.364 --> 07:45.899
She's faxting.

07:45.966 --> 07:47.801
Well, as long as
she's not fexting.

07:47.868 --> 07:49.002
Is that sex faxing?

07:49.069 --> 07:50.971
Yeah. Apparently,
it's a real problem
in Russia.

07:51.038 --> 07:52.640
Oh.

07:52.706 --> 07:53.941
What's all this?

07:54.007 --> 07:56.109
Well, we're establishing
new traditions this year,

07:56.176 --> 07:58.879
so I felt some of them
should be Korean.

07:58.946 --> 08:01.314
So, you bought
4 pounds of bulgogi

08:01.381 --> 08:03.216
and eight jars
of kimchi?

08:03.283 --> 08:04.852
Hearing it out loud,
I know what you're thinking.

08:04.918 --> 08:06.353
Needs more bulgogi.
I'll be right back.

08:06.419 --> 08:07.921
Ken, Ken, Ken, Ken!

08:07.988 --> 08:10.123
Where's all the stuff
I actually asked you to buy?

08:10.190 --> 08:11.825
Oh, it all felt
too American.

08:12.560 --> 08:13.894
Dave, kill the camera.

08:13.961 --> 08:16.296
You're not putting me
in a position to succeed.

08:18.599 --> 08:20.768
So, this is
some big-baby-ish reaction

08:20.834 --> 08:22.770
to me claiming your heritage
isn't important to you?

08:22.836 --> 08:26.607
Oh, no. I'm simply sharing
my culture with my family.

08:26.674 --> 08:28.576
Why?
Does that bother you?

08:28.642 --> 08:30.477
Yeah. It does.

08:30.544 --> 08:33.413
Our kids are half-Japanese,
my parents are
also coming over,

08:33.480 --> 08:35.215
and you're hijacking
Thanksgiving.

08:35.282 --> 08:38.652
How you feel if I made
tempura and soba noodles?

08:38.719 --> 08:41.922
Like someone
who actually supports
his spouse's heritage.

08:41.989 --> 08:43.456
Really?

08:43.523 --> 08:45.626
Good. Then that's
what I'm gonna do.

in the house, by the way,

I give a crap about
where I come from. (CHUCKLES)

what that is.

09:49.790 --> 09:51.224
Why are you wearing
my wedding hanbok?

09:51.291 --> 09:52.459
Wait. This is Dad's.

09:53.861 --> 09:55.996
Oh, God.

09:56.063 --> 09:58.866
You make
beautiful bride.
Okay. All right.

09:58.932 --> 10:02.102
Whoa!
Looking very cool, Ken.

10:02.169 --> 10:04.471
Thank you, Jerry,
for embracing my heritage.

10:04.537 --> 10:07.808
Means a lot in light
of some recent persecution.

10:07.875 --> 10:09.843

Just shut up.

10:11.679 --> 10:14.247
Is everything okay?
(SIGHS) yes.

10:14.314 --> 10:16.183
Yeah, Dave is doing
a school project,

10:16.249 --> 10:19.286
so we're pinning down
a few traditions.

10:19.352 --> 10:21.722
Otherwise,
it's just a totally
normal Thanksgiving.

10:22.990 --> 10:25.558
Happy Thanksgiving!

10:25.625 --> 10:28.095
Or, as turkeys call it,
the reckoning.

10:30.330 --> 10:31.498
What are you
doing here?

10:31.564 --> 10:32.700
Oh, hey, Ke...
Oh. Sorry, ken.

10:32.766 --> 10:34.434
I didn't realize
the dress was...

10:34.501 --> 10:36.103
Third-century Asian pimp?

10:37.838 --> 10:39.639
I thought you went
to the sportsmen's lodge.

10:39.707 --> 10:41.408
I did,
but that was a bust.

10:41.474 --> 10:44.011
Hundreds of drunk divorcees,
and only two of them
were ladies.

10:44.077 --> 10:45.679
(SIGHS)

10:45.746 --> 10:47.480
It was
quite a sausage fest.

10:47.547 --> 10:49.216
Ironically,
they ran out of sausage.

10:50.517 --> 10:52.686
So I figured I'd take
you up on your invite.

10:52.753 --> 10:54.722
I didn't invite you.
Julie did.

10:54.788 --> 10:56.356
I know,
but her thing
sounded lame.

10:59.426 --> 11:01.494
Oh.
We brought you this.

11:01.929 --> 11:03.130
Oh!

11:03.196 --> 11:05.598
Look, Allison. Sake.
(CHUCKLES)

11:05.665 --> 11:08.769
Your parents brought
even more Japanese
culture into own home.

11:08.836 --> 11:10.838
Actually,
it's just chardonnay.

11:10.904 --> 11:14.474
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
We had this at brunch.
Yeah. Very oaky.

11:14.541 --> 11:18.311
Maybe next time,
read the label before
you open your cry hole.

11:18.378 --> 11:21.448
Oh. We brought this
for the kids.
Aw!

11:21.514 --> 11:25.485

Thanksgiving, no gift.

11:25.552 --> 11:26.754

a little something.

11:43.370 --> 11:44.537
That's from both of us.

11:44.604 --> 11:45.906
Not till you pay me,
it's not.

11:47.374 --> 11:49.176
Please. Come in.

11:49.242 --> 11:52.612
I was just finishing
cheesing some crackers.

11:52.679 --> 11:54.882
I am just so happy
that you guys came.

11:54.948 --> 11:57.350
Well, it's great
to be here.
DAMONA: Oh! (CHUCKLES)

11:57.417 --> 11:58.986
All right.

11:59.052 --> 12:00.653
Ooh! This is bad, Clark.
This is really bad.

12:00.720 --> 12:03.356
I know!
She's pre-cheesing
the crackers,

12:03.423 --> 12:06.259
and she doesn't know
how much cheese I like.

12:06.326 --> 12:08.461
No! Look.
There's nobody here.

12:08.528 --> 12:10.530
She said
it was a party.
Oh!

12:10.597 --> 12:11.832
How the hell are we gonna
get out of this?

12:11.899 --> 12:13.100
My cousins
are waiting on me!

12:13.166 --> 12:14.935
I know. And I got to get
to my turkey trot thing.

12:15.002 --> 12:16.870
If you don't get
there on time,
you get there late,

12:16.937 --> 12:19.807
which means
you've missed part of it.

12:19.873 --> 12:22.609
Thanks for explaining
how time works.

12:22.675 --> 12:25.745
Look, we're just
gonna tell her
we're just stopping by,

12:25.813 --> 12:27.547
we have other plans.
She'll understand.

Right. Good.

Where are you?

on your way
somewhere else?

Oh, no. Don't bother.

"stops by on their way

my friend! That's who!

That is
just the right amount.

Mmm, damn!
This bulgogi's tight!

So, Jerry,
how flight?

13:11.892 --> 13:14.227
Oh, fine.
We were a little late
taking off because...

13:14.294 --> 13:16.563
Too much.
Just small talk.

13:18.098 --> 13:19.967
Got it.

13:20.033 --> 13:22.169
Soba noodles
really good.

you like them.

what's even better?
Kimchi.

Mmm-hmm.

Mmm-hmm.

This cabbage
fermented up real nice.

13:36.016 --> 13:38.185
I got to say,
if I were coleslaw,

13:38.251 --> 13:39.652
I'd be looking over
my shoulder right now,

13:39.719 --> 13:41.554
'cause kimchi's
coming up fast, yo.

13:45.525 --> 13:46.994
You know,
you guys really got

13:47.060 --> 13:49.396
an interesting take
on Thanksgiving here, yeah?

13:49.462 --> 13:52.199
Yeah, it's cool
to celebrate
both cultures.

13:52.265 --> 13:54.467
It's important to keep
in touch with our roots.

13:54.534 --> 13:56.069
Where turkey?

13:57.570 --> 13:59.839
I'm with chuckles
here.

13:59.907 --> 14:02.175
I would kill a man
for some mashed potatoes.

14:03.376 --> 14:05.278
Are, are you using
that fork?

14:05.345 --> 14:06.613
Thanks.

14:10.717 --> 14:14.387
Okay, I'm gonna need
to get everyone saying
what they're thankful for.

14:14.454 --> 14:15.622
Now is not
a good time, Dave.

14:15.688 --> 14:16.856
Really?

14:16.924 --> 14:18.358
Thanksgiving's
not a good time

14:18.425 --> 14:20.727
to go around the table
and say what
we're thankful for?

14:26.133 --> 14:27.400
All right.
I'll go first.

14:29.569 --> 14:31.438

so awkward,

is the last one
in the driveway.

Oh, I'm sorry.
He's kind of weird.

He's weird?
You're wearing your
mother's wedding dress.

14:46.219 --> 14:47.820
Fits you good,
though.

14:49.189 --> 14:51.091
Okay, then.
I'll go first.

14:51.158 --> 14:53.626
I'm thankful
for the Korean traditions

14:53.693 --> 14:56.663
we're establishing
here today.

14:56.729 --> 14:59.566
I'm thankful for my husband,
who's not at all stubborn

14:59.632 --> 15:02.702
and picks the absolute
best time to make a point.

15:02.769 --> 15:06.606
I'm thankful
for my wife's ability
to convey sarcasm.

15:06.673 --> 15:10.543
And for her ability
to brainwash our kids
with Japanese propaganda.

15:10.610 --> 15:12.312
No offense,
Jerry and Pam.

15:12.379 --> 15:13.513
Offense, Allison.

15:14.481 --> 15:16.083
You are such a child.

15:16.149 --> 15:18.318
And you know if Molly
had gotten a Korean tattoo,

15:18.385 --> 15:20.687
we'd all happily
be sitting here
eating turkey!

15:20.753 --> 15:22.055
Molly got tattoo?

15:22.122 --> 15:23.690
Turkey? Where turkey?

15:33.633 --> 15:35.502
Damona?
Do you want to guess?

15:37.570 --> 15:38.838
Corn and cider?

15:39.639 --> 15:41.208
Nope. Clark?

15:41.908 --> 15:43.910
Gunpowder and wool?

15:43.977 --> 15:45.645
Nope.

15:45.712 --> 15:49.416
The two most lasting gifts
that the pilgrims gave
the native Americans

15:49.482 --> 15:52.419
were smallpox
and gonorrhea.

15:53.920 --> 15:56.990
I just love
Thanksgiving trivia!

15:57.757 --> 15:59.059

15:59.626 --> 16:01.528

it's time for dessert.

16:03.430 --> 16:05.198
I'm just gonna go
put the pies in.

16:06.566 --> 16:09.569
Yo!
The pie's not even in!

16:09.636 --> 16:12.939
Okay, this has become
a hostage situation.

16:14.341 --> 16:16.409
You know what?
I got this.

16:16.476 --> 16:17.710
What are you gonna do?

16:17.777 --> 16:19.712
I'm gonna make this go
a little bit faster.

16:19.779 --> 16:21.414
Okay, that is
not going to work,

16:21.481 --> 16:22.982
because A,
she has a cellphone,

16:23.050 --> 16:25.752
and B, we are not
in a Bugs Bunny cartoon.

16:27.187 --> 16:30.423
In go the pies,
out come the photo albums!

from under the bus.

both of you guys.

on this night
that I have been dreading.

to kick you out,

you know?

17:03.356 --> 17:05.592
It's past my bedtime,
and I got to clean up.

17:05.658 --> 17:07.460
What about the pies?
Which...
(STOMPS)

17:08.595 --> 17:11.698
You should bring
to work tomorrow.

17:11.764 --> 17:13.633

the pie for? Get on out!

17:13.700 --> 17:15.302

Bye!

Girl, bye!
Bye!

17:23.243 --> 17:25.912
What wrong with you?

17:25.978 --> 17:29.015
Allison called me out
for being a lapsed Korean,
and I lost it.

17:29.082 --> 17:31.418
Oh, yeah.
You whitest guy I know.

17:33.086 --> 17:35.788
You cried
when the R.E.M.
broke up.

17:35.855 --> 17:38.158
You must be
so disappointed.

17:38.225 --> 17:41.294
You started a Korean school.
You go to a Korean church.

17:41.361 --> 17:44.597
I mean, you go
to the driving range
when most people are working.

17:45.432 --> 17:46.733
I let you down.

17:46.799 --> 17:49.369
Son...

17:49.436 --> 17:51.504
You don't have to prove
you're Korean.

17:51.571 --> 17:55.242
The most important thing
is to be good father
and good husband,

17:55.308 --> 17:56.743
which you are.

17:56.809 --> 17:59.011
Well, not so much today.

18:01.348 --> 18:03.616
Besides, being Korean

18:03.683 --> 18:05.885
is not what you wear
or what you eat.

18:06.786 --> 18:08.421
Korean in here.

18:10.190 --> 18:12.592
Trust me.
You plenty Korean.

18:14.461 --> 18:17.230
Now go fix
Thanksgiving.

18:17.297 --> 18:19.866
Because this,
hot mess.

18:22.435 --> 18:23.770
Thanks, Dad.

18:26.806 --> 18:29.342
Besides, uh,
you're not true Korean

18:29.409 --> 18:31.878

of golf ball

18:31.944 --> 18:33.613

the weirdest
Thanksgiving ever.

Don't spread this
at the office,

that around the house,

Ken likes
to wear a dress.

19:04.411 --> 19:07.380
I, I made a mistake.
I should have come
to your thing, and...

It was very nice of you
to invite me.

That's odd.

must have stopped
at some point.

Huh.

Well, at least that means
Thanksgiving's over,
thank God.

19:26.666 --> 19:28.000

on Monday.

20:22.522 --> 20:25.392
Eh, you know,
I don't think we need
to do that, you know.

20:25.458 --> 20:27.960
I mean, my dad said
being Korean's in here.

20:28.027 --> 20:30.196
Plus, it's Black Friday.
We should hit the mall.

20:30.263 --> 20:31.831
(CHUCKLES)

20:31.898 --> 20:34.967
Forever 21 is
practically giving away
summer tanks.

20:40.707 --> 20:42.275
(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)

20:46.045 --> 20:48.047
DAVE:
In search of wisdom

20:51.183 --> 20:53.553
two cultures come together
as one.

20:57.724 --> 21:00.360
Old-fashioned methods
are kept alive,

21:01.861 --> 21:03.963
and new ideas
are embraced.

21:07.099 --> 21:09.336
But the most important
tradition of all

21:09.402 --> 21:12.104
is how now,
just like back then,

21:12.171 --> 21:14.040
everyone bands together

21:15.241 --> 21:16.776
when the
white man invades.

21:22.615 --> 21:24.584
What? I didn't have a lot
to work with.
