WEBVTT

00:14.600 --> 00:16.520
Don't move.
I'm not going to hurt you.

00:16.720 --> 00:18.080
I swear. Take it easy.

00:23.000 --> 00:25.800
-Who are you?
-I was attacked, I'm injured...

00:25.960 --> 00:28.640
-I decided to take refuge here.
-Don't you have a home?

00:28.840 --> 00:31.040
-I live on the streets.
-I recognize you.

00:32.600 --> 00:34.000
I've seen you somewhere.

00:35.240 --> 00:36.880
I have one of those faces.

00:38.320 --> 00:39.320
I know who you are.

00:40.480 --> 00:42.440
You're one
of the Parot doctrine ex-cons.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.120
I was attacked...

00:45.000 --> 00:46.840
by a guy in a monkey mask and...

00:47.520 --> 00:50.000
I'm hurt,
I won't make it very far.

00:50.240 --> 00:52.040
I'm just asking you
for a few hours.

00:58.600 --> 01:02.080
OFFICER ISABEL MORA ON THE RUN

01:52.200 --> 01:54.000
Think, Nieto, think.

02:37.920 --> 02:40.480
Do you have hydrogen peroxide
or anything to disinfect this?

02:40.640 --> 02:42.320
-No, there's nothing here.
-Right.

02:43.600 --> 02:44.960
It doesn't look good.

02:47.160 --> 02:48.200
There's no gangrene.

02:48.360 --> 02:50.400
-How do you know?
-It doesn't smell rotten.

02:50.520 --> 02:52.520
You can smell
dead flesh quickly.

02:58.160 --> 02:59.040
I'll go.

03:06.240 --> 03:08.840
I don't know if you like tuna.
I hate it.

03:09.440 --> 03:11.120
Yes, that's great. Thanks.

03:11.600 --> 03:12.840
It's yesterday's bread.

03:13.720 --> 03:16.160
It doesn't matter. Did you tell
anyone you saw me here?

03:16.600 --> 03:18.720
No. I can keep a secret.

03:20.320 --> 03:21.320
...in the morning.

03:22.040 --> 03:24.480
The Cabinet
is assessing a new system

03:24.600 --> 03:26.720
for fixing electricity prices.

03:26.920 --> 03:30.080
The CPI has dropped 0.2%...

03:30.080 --> 03:31.640
I brought you gum, too.

03:31.800 --> 03:34.600
Isabel Mora, the cop
who killed a man last night,

03:34.760 --> 03:36.120
remains at large.

03:36.280 --> 03:37.280
Roberto Plaza,

03:37.400 --> 03:39.880
the ex-con identified
as the masked killer,

03:40.040 --> 03:41.520
is still on the run.

03:41.640 --> 03:43.320
The police warn
he is dangerous

03:43.440 --> 03:44.640
and injured.

03:44.840 --> 03:46.040
As we mentioned,

03:46.160 --> 03:48.320
the Cabinet is
analyzing today the order

03:48.440 --> 03:50.720
that will set
a new system for...

03:50.920 --> 03:52.160
Get out of here.

03:56.440 --> 03:58.000
I brought something to eat.

03:58.480 --> 04:00.160
Or you can go find your own.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.840
Want help slicing the bread,
Plaza?

04:15.440 --> 04:17.040
You shouldn't have the radio on.

04:17.160 --> 04:18.280
I like to stay informed.

04:21.400 --> 04:22.760
I won't let you arrest me.

04:22.920 --> 04:23.960
Isabel Mora...

04:24.120 --> 04:25.640
You're a murderer, I'm a cop.

04:25.760 --> 04:27.960
...fled from the scene
of the crime last night,

04:28.120 --> 04:31.000
having been stopped
after shooting

04:31.000 --> 04:32.920
a middle-aged man
with a firearm.

04:34.280 --> 04:36.320
Looks like I'm not
the only one who's screwed.

04:38.040 --> 04:40.120
-I'm not a murderer.
-I didn't say you were.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.800
The radio did.
We're one and the same.

04:43.400 --> 04:44.640
You and I are not the same.

04:45.080 --> 04:47.880
...the alleged Ex-Con Killer
in the Parot case.

04:48.160 --> 04:49.920
Plaza took off after...

04:50.280 --> 04:52.200
If you arrest me,
you're screwed too.

05:01.480 --> 05:02.480
How are you?

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
What are you doing here?

05:09.120 --> 05:11.920
Well, a father worries
about his daughter.

05:16.520 --> 05:17.480
Of course.

05:18.120 --> 05:19.600
You never had a father.

05:19.800 --> 05:20.840
No.

05:22.120 --> 05:23.680
I always wanted to know
who he was.

05:24.720 --> 05:26.840
You don't need to worry
about that anymore.

05:27.840 --> 05:29.720
Whatever happens,
I'll be here for you.

05:34.520 --> 05:36.240
Why would she do
something like this?

05:41.600 --> 05:42.600
Well...

05:43.440 --> 05:44.880
I was sick, Sol.

05:46.080 --> 05:48.520
And when people aren't well,
they do unforgivable things.

05:51.120 --> 05:53.640
But in the end, we all have
to pay for our actions.

05:56.080 --> 05:57.120
Can I ask you a favor?

05:58.160 --> 05:59.160
Yeah?

06:01.960 --> 06:04.520
All parents have a photo
of their daughter, you know?

06:05.800 --> 06:08.160
And I don't have
too many things to be proud of.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.080
Would you?

06:14.120 --> 06:15.120
Great.

06:15.640 --> 06:16.720
Okay.

06:19.080 --> 06:20.080
Hang on.

06:23.320 --> 06:24.320
Smile.

06:26.320 --> 06:27.320
Thank you.

06:28.080 --> 06:30.120
-No worries.
-This is very important to me.

06:30.400 --> 06:31.400
Very.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
Well, I'll be going.

06:34.360 --> 06:35.360
-Okay.
-We'll talk?

06:35.480 --> 06:36.640
Yeah.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.240
I have something to tell you.

08:13.440 --> 08:14.640
She was right.

08:22.680 --> 08:24.080
That son of a...

08:27.080 --> 08:28.800
This is the CCTV
from the parking lot

08:28.960 --> 08:30.520
where Nieto leaves his car.

08:32.080 --> 08:33.560
He helped her escape.

08:33.880 --> 08:35.680
This morning,
I followed him from his place

08:35.840 --> 08:37.640
and he went straight
to Isabel's house.

08:37.800 --> 08:39.800
I know him well,
he's been my boss for years,

08:39.920 --> 08:42.600
and something's not right.
That's why I followed him...

08:47.480 --> 08:50.120
Isabel was hiding at his place
before she took off.

08:50.120 --> 08:50.160
Isabel was hiding at his place
before she took off.
I didn't say anything...
out of respect.

08:50.160 --> 08:52.320
I didn't say anything...
out of respect.

08:52.480 --> 08:55.480
I don't want to hear it.
You know what you have to do.

09:04.320 --> 09:06.720
How much longer are you thinking
of hiding out here?

09:08.120 --> 09:09.120
As long as it takes.

09:10.080 --> 09:11.080
You won't escape.

09:12.720 --> 09:14.880
I can't leave, but you're
not going anywhere either.

09:16.880 --> 09:18.000
I was imposing justice.

09:18.800 --> 09:21.960
Justice for those they raped,
killed and butchered.

09:22.120 --> 09:24.160
And yes, I'm one of them
but thanks...

09:26.040 --> 09:27.200
thanks to what I've done,

09:27.320 --> 09:29.800
I've gone some way
to repaying my debt.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.120
What are you talking about,
repaying a debt?

09:34.000 --> 09:36.040
There's never
a justification for murder.

09:36.240 --> 09:37.240
-Isn't there?
-No.

09:37.360 --> 09:39.520
I had to do
what the police failed to do.

09:39.640 --> 09:41.000
And who asked you to?

09:42.040 --> 09:45.080
"Time served." Some tagline.
Where'd you get it?

09:45.560 --> 09:47.080
You think yourself a hero,
right?

09:47.080 --> 09:47.120
You think yourself a hero,
right?
I seem to be for some people.
You should be one of them.

09:47.120 --> 09:49.600
I seem to be for some people.
You should be one of them.

09:51.200 --> 09:54.240
I know your suffering.
I tried to kill your rapist.

09:54.400 --> 09:56.400
It was what I wanted most
and I think you did too.

09:56.520 --> 09:57.520
No.

10:00.240 --> 10:01.800
"It was what I wanted most..."

10:05.320 --> 10:06.320
Why would you say that?

10:10.240 --> 10:12.240
Why was it what you wanted most?

10:13.640 --> 10:16.120
Because you're the real reason
I started all this.

10:20.920 --> 10:22.560
What do I have to do
with you, Plaza?

10:23.800 --> 10:25.120
And why are you in my house?

10:31.760 --> 10:33.480
-Nieto.
-What is it?

10:33.640 --> 10:35.280
-You have to come with us.
-Why?

10:36.240 --> 10:37.960
You're under arrest
for harboring

10:38.120 --> 10:39.480
and aiding a murder suspect.

10:39.640 --> 10:41.320
Let's go speak
to the Commissioner first.

10:41.480 --> 10:44.040
I want to speak...
Take me to the Commissioner.

10:44.040 --> 10:47.680
Sol, the radiant sunbeam
who has lit up my life.

10:49.160 --> 10:50.520
So I can publish this, right?

10:52.640 --> 10:54.880
Isabel will lose her shit
when she sees this.

10:55.320 --> 10:58.360
Perhaps it will help her come to
her senses and turn herself in.

10:59.160 --> 11:02.120
You know we have to pixelate
the kid's face, she's a minor.

11:03.080 --> 11:05.200
It's a shame. We look great...

11:07.640 --> 11:09.160
I'm going to file for custody.

11:10.480 --> 11:11.840
She'd live like a princess.

11:13.600 --> 11:15.120
A nice fairy tale
for your viewers.

11:18.040 --> 11:19.800
Your show today will be a hit.

11:37.480 --> 11:39.360
-What's that?
-Nothing.

11:39.520 --> 11:41.920
-What are you doing?
-Checking the hens.

11:52.160 --> 11:53.000
Why did you take this?

11:54.600 --> 11:55.600
Answer me.

12:01.720 --> 12:02.840
Goddammit.

12:03.400 --> 12:06.040
-About time. Listen to me.
-Where's Isabel?

12:06.240 --> 12:08.400
No idea, but I can prove

12:08.520 --> 12:10.360
-she's the victim here.
-I have proof

12:10.520 --> 12:12.440
that you helped her escape
in your car.

12:12.560 --> 12:15.080
-That doesn't matter.
-You'll get three years

12:15.080 --> 12:15.160
-That doesn't matter.
-You'll get three years
for harboring a criminal,
and 13 out of the police force.

12:15.160 --> 12:18.200
for harboring a criminal,
and 13 out of the police force.

12:18.360 --> 12:20.800
-You've screwed your life up.
-I need my phone.

12:20.960 --> 12:23.280
Yes, so you can warn her that
we know about the car.

12:23.480 --> 12:26.840
No. It's to show you
that Julián López de Haro

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
-is responsible for everything.
-Enough crap. Where is Isabel?

12:30.000 --> 12:30.040
-is responsible for everything.
-Enough crap. Where is Isabel?
Haro has an apartment
with monitors

12:30.040 --> 12:32.040
Haro has an apartment
with monitors

12:32.160 --> 12:34.360
where he watches and records
everything at her place.

12:34.520 --> 12:36.560
I saw him put something
in her milk...

12:36.680 --> 12:38.680
He planted
the newspaper clippings.

12:38.840 --> 12:40.960
Look at my phone,
I took photos of what I found.

12:41.120 --> 12:42.120
If Isabel were innocent,

12:42.120 --> 12:42.160
If Isabel were innocent,
you wouldn't have had
to help her escape.

12:42.160 --> 12:43.720
you wouldn't have had
to help her escape.

12:43.880 --> 12:45.720
I didn't have the evidence
I have now.

12:45.880 --> 12:48.040
Get my phone, dammit,
have them bring it.

12:48.200 --> 12:50.360
-Where is Isabel?
-I don't know!

12:53.440 --> 12:56.320
Commissioner, Plaza was spotted
near a village in the mountains.

12:56.760 --> 12:58.280
-Reliable?
-One hundred percent.

13:03.880 --> 13:04.880
Commissioner.

13:08.440 --> 13:10.120
If we go much longer
without water,

13:10.240 --> 13:12.680
they'll find a couple of dead
bodies when they show up.

13:13.840 --> 13:14.840
Shut it.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.440
How long since
you drank something?

13:17.880 --> 13:20.760
-I told you to shut it, please.
-There's your answer.

13:21.400 --> 13:23.200
No time
when you're on the run, right?

13:27.600 --> 13:28.720
The lake.

13:29.440 --> 13:30.600
If you leave, I can run.

13:31.880 --> 13:33.480
I'm not going. You are.

13:38.800 --> 13:40.280
Aren't you worried
I might escape?

13:40.440 --> 13:42.120
I've got great aim,
it's up to you.

14:11.120 --> 14:12.320
Civil Guard, freeze!

14:13.120 --> 14:14.400
Civil Guard, freeze!

14:15.120 --> 14:16.160
Stop!

14:16.440 --> 14:18.120
Freeze! Don't move!

14:55.800 --> 14:57.120
Bring me Nieto's phone.

15:44.640 --> 15:45.760
Thanks, bye.

15:48.280 --> 15:49.600
Did you get the parcel back?

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
I'll come home now.

16:11.800 --> 16:13.360
Come on, Nieto, pick up.

16:19.680 --> 16:21.160
...we have another exclusive.

16:21.520 --> 16:24.040
The rape of Isabel Mora,
16 years ago,

16:24.160 --> 16:26.320
bore fruit with the birth
of a little girl.

16:26.800 --> 16:28.960
In light of her mother's
sudden disappearance,

16:29.120 --> 16:31.000
this program
can exclusively reveal

16:31.000 --> 16:31.040
this program
can exclusively reveal
Julián López de Haro
will file for joint custody

16:31.040 --> 16:33.160
Julián López de Haro
will file for joint custody

16:33.280 --> 16:34.520
of his daughter.

17:12.760 --> 17:13.920
Don't move.

17:40.120 --> 17:42.000
I couldn't wake you up.

17:42.680 --> 17:44.720
You son of a bitch!

17:51.320 --> 17:52.800
Those are your first words?

17:53.960 --> 17:55.160
It was all you.

17:56.160 --> 17:57.160
I was good, wasn't I?

18:00.640 --> 18:02.560
-Just to get revenge?
-Well...

18:03.480 --> 18:04.840
Don't play it down.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.720
I could have killed you
when I got out.

18:08.120 --> 18:10.160
But you would have
suffered too little.

18:11.160 --> 18:12.720
Destroying
everything someone has

18:12.880 --> 18:14.160
is far more satisfying.

18:14.800 --> 18:16.160
Isn't that right, Isabel?

18:16.880 --> 18:17.880
It's not the same.

18:19.320 --> 18:20.440
You raped me.

18:21.480 --> 18:23.040
That's a matter of perspective.

18:24.160 --> 18:26.400
That of the rapist
and the victim.

18:27.120 --> 18:29.400
Do you know
what they do to rapists in jail?

18:31.000 --> 18:32.080
I don't feel sorry for you.

18:32.800 --> 18:33.800
It's mutual.

18:37.280 --> 18:40.840
They say the love for a child
weakens us, blinds us.

18:41.880 --> 18:43.080
I don't get it.

18:44.920 --> 18:47.160
You could have fled,
forgotten about the kid.

18:47.520 --> 18:50.160
But you didn't.
So predictable, Isabel.

18:51.880 --> 18:53.640
-What do you want to do with me?
-Nothing.

18:55.120 --> 18:56.120
You'll die here.

18:57.760 --> 18:58.760
-No.
-Yes.

19:01.120 --> 19:03.120
-No.
-It's rough, huh?

19:05.600 --> 19:06.600
Real rough.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
Abaño.

19:36.640 --> 19:38.440
I need to get out
of here somehow.

19:44.080 --> 19:45.120
Open, I'm taking him.

20:15.880 --> 20:17.080
You seem calm.

20:17.400 --> 20:19.120
You're right,
I can't get out of here.

20:19.920 --> 20:21.320
Is the fight gone out of you?

20:24.080 --> 20:25.640
I'm more worried
about other things.

20:28.960 --> 20:29.960
Like what?

20:33.000 --> 20:34.760
The pain of those left behind.

20:37.720 --> 20:38.760
I don't follow.

20:40.880 --> 20:41.920
Look, you're smart.

20:44.160 --> 20:45.240
Let's strike a deal.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.800
You think you're
in a position to negotiate?

20:52.400 --> 20:54.080
Send my daughter
a farewell message,

20:54.240 --> 20:55.600
and you can rape me again.

21:00.760 --> 21:02.120
I just want to tell her
I'm okay.

21:03.040 --> 21:05.400
Not to worry,
that I'm in a safe place,

21:05.520 --> 21:07.000
and I managed
to get out of Spain.

21:08.880 --> 21:11.000
I don't want her living
with the agony of not knowing,

21:11.560 --> 21:13.160
always looking for me.

21:14.040 --> 21:15.720
That destroys you, it kills you.

21:16.600 --> 21:18.000
I've seen it
in so many families.

21:19.720 --> 21:22.160
I want her to live believing
we'll see each other again.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.280
To have a happy life,
not like mine.

21:29.880 --> 21:31.640
Do this one, tiny, thing and

21:32.160 --> 21:34.440
you can have your way
with me again?

21:38.640 --> 21:39.640
I accept the deal.

21:45.040 --> 21:46.760
Tell me what to write
and I'll get it to her.

21:46.960 --> 21:48.440
-The message comes first.
-Okay.

21:49.040 --> 21:50.320
Business then pleasure.

21:53.040 --> 21:55.080
By the way,
this phone is a burner.

21:55.960 --> 21:57.560
In case
you were planning anything.

21:57.720 --> 21:59.520
I just want to send a message
to my daughter.

21:59.720 --> 22:00.840
Number?

22:01.400 --> 22:05.120
Four, three, two,
eight, nine, nine.

22:05.440 --> 22:07.160
Correct, our daughter's number.

22:08.920 --> 22:10.360
Now, the tear-jerking text.

22:20.920 --> 22:22.480
HONEY. I LOVE YOU, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT ME I'M IN A SAFE PLACE

22:22.600 --> 22:24.040
I GOT OUT OF THE COUNTRY.
TELL GRANDMA

22:24.040 --> 22:24.080
I GOT OUT OF THE COUNTRY.
TELL GRANDMA
I'LL ALWAYS REMEMBER
OUR TIME TOGETHER IN ROME

22:24.080 --> 22:25.480
I'LL ALWAYS REMEMBER
OUR TIME TOGETHER IN ROME

22:44.160 --> 22:45.160
Sol, honey.

22:47.600 --> 22:48.960
What's wrong, sweety?

22:51.760 --> 22:52.760
She's gone.

22:53.440 --> 22:54.440
What?

22:55.240 --> 22:56.520
I won't see her ever again.

22:58.920 --> 23:02.520
-She'd never leave without you.
-She has, she's gone.

23:05.120 --> 23:07.600
"Tell Grandma
I'll always remember Rome.

23:08.440 --> 23:10.360
Our time together in Rome

23:11.400 --> 23:12.600
when I was a girl."

23:13.840 --> 23:15.160
What happened in Rome?

23:16.280 --> 23:17.640
We never went to Rome.

23:19.160 --> 23:20.960
Why would she say that, then?

23:22.120 --> 23:23.040
Grandma?

23:24.800 --> 23:25.800
Grandma.

23:26.360 --> 23:28.800
What's wrong?
You're scaring me.

23:32.600 --> 23:35.560
When your mom was a little girl
she loved playing detective.

23:36.120 --> 23:37.640
She'd always leave me notes

23:38.000 --> 23:41.680
written in code she'd invented,
and I've still got it.

23:43.360 --> 23:45.680
-Here. Find a pen and paper.
-Okay.

23:46.600 --> 23:48.240
-The 'R' is 'H'.
-Okay.

23:49.320 --> 23:50.560
'O' is 'A'.

23:51.720 --> 23:53.000
'M' is 'R'.

23:58.160 --> 23:59.160
It's Haro.

24:16.360 --> 24:17.800
Let's set the mood, shall we?

24:19.640 --> 24:21.400
There's nothing romantic
about this.

24:21.520 --> 24:22.920
Smile a bit, won't you?

24:23.520 --> 24:24.920
It'll be over
before you know it.

24:25.640 --> 24:26.720
I'm not going to smile.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.160
I said smile, dammit.

24:30.160 --> 24:31.160
I'm not an animal.

24:32.520 --> 24:34.000
They ignored that fact
at my trial.

24:37.840 --> 24:40.240
You think it's different
if you don't use violence?

24:41.800 --> 24:44.560
-You're a monster.
-Don't call me that.

24:46.680 --> 24:47.880
Put the damn dress on.

25:45.880 --> 25:47.960
Despite it all,
you're still gorgeous.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.640
-Save the compliments.
-Very well.

25:56.680 --> 25:57.920
Let's get to it.

26:04.800 --> 26:05.800
Drink.

26:39.920 --> 26:40.920
All of it.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.640
Better asleep than awake, right?

27:08.520 --> 27:10.320
Lie down, I don't want you
to crack your skull.

27:41.160 --> 27:43.120
You won't remember any of it
when you're dead.

27:49.160 --> 27:50.080
A bit of music?

28:31.120 --> 28:33.080
Who'd have thought
we'd end up together?

28:34.640 --> 28:35.880
Life's a funny thing.

28:45.120 --> 28:46.920
No!

28:50.960 --> 28:52.000
Isabel.

28:52.000 --> 28:53.520
I'm here, honey, it's over.

28:53.720 --> 28:55.480
I'm here, my love, I'm here.

28:57.760 --> 28:59.520
Come with me, come on.

28:59.720 --> 29:01.800
-Call for help.
-Try and get up.

29:07.960 --> 29:09.880
Wait.

29:18.960 --> 29:20.400
It's okay, honey, it's over.

30:00.040 --> 30:01.160
Nieto, over here.

30:06.560 --> 30:07.560
What the hell's this?

30:08.800 --> 30:09.800
Shit.

30:31.320 --> 30:32.280
Clear.

30:36.680 --> 30:37.680
He's taken her.

30:38.360 --> 30:40.000
-He's taken her!
-Where?

30:40.160 --> 30:43.280
-I don't know.
-Take it easy, we're here now.

31:01.960 --> 31:04.200
See what you get
for playing me.

31:22.120 --> 31:23.120
No!

31:23.320 --> 31:25.000
No, please!

31:25.600 --> 31:26.600
No!

31:28.920 --> 31:29.920
No!

31:31.080 --> 31:32.080
No.

31:32.640 --> 31:34.440
You son of a bitch!

31:34.720 --> 31:35.720
Go ahead, scream.

31:36.200 --> 31:37.640
Who's going to hear you?

31:38.120 --> 31:39.120
Right...

31:41.080 --> 31:42.400
This is
the end of the road for us.

31:52.960 --> 31:54.080
Now we're even.

32:03.720 --> 32:04.720
Shit.

32:05.600 --> 32:08.280
It's impossible to comb
every blade of grass.

32:09.240 --> 32:11.240
Even if we had the entire force
at our disposal,

32:11.400 --> 32:12.400
it's impossible.

32:12.520 --> 32:16.160
I need Julián López de Haro's
vehicle license plate.

32:26.640 --> 32:28.240
They can't locate Haro's car.

32:41.040 --> 32:42.360
No!

32:45.080 --> 32:48.000
Would you risk burying her
in the forest in broad daylight?

32:48.160 --> 32:50.280
Anyone could see him
and alert us.

32:51.040 --> 32:53.240
-Say that again.
-Anyone could see him.

32:54.000 --> 32:55.960
No, Haro is meticulous.
He'd never do that.

32:59.360 --> 33:00.920
Haro is an aristocrat.

33:02.800 --> 33:04.080
He must have land.

33:05.440 --> 33:06.840
He must have private land.

33:08.920 --> 33:10.000
Quick, call his father.

34:58.040 --> 34:59.000
Come on, quick.

35:01.080 --> 35:02.080
Let's split up.

35:02.520 --> 35:03.560
Come on, men.

35:07.120 --> 35:09.160
This side,
let's head down here, too.

35:10.000 --> 35:11.000
Quickly.

35:27.600 --> 35:29.520
Over here!

35:38.280 --> 35:39.800
-Bring the shovels!
-Isabel!

35:41.080 --> 35:42.120
Isabel!

35:42.120 --> 35:42.160
Isabel!
Get a crowbar, quickly!

35:42.160 --> 35:43.800
Get a crowbar, quickly!

35:44.000 --> 35:45.000
-Isabel!
-Careful.

35:45.120 --> 35:46.120
Isabel!

35:46.480 --> 35:47.960
Bring be a crowbar, run!

35:56.880 --> 35:57.920
Isabel.

36:04.000 --> 36:05.760
Here, lay her here.

36:08.160 --> 36:09.080
-Put her here.
-Come on.

36:09.080 --> 36:09.160
-Put her here.
-Come on.
Here.

36:09.160 --> 36:10.080
Here.

36:10.240 --> 36:11.240
-Just here.
-Careful.

36:11.800 --> 36:12.800
Isabel.

36:13.400 --> 36:15.520
Call an ambulance, now!

36:19.360 --> 36:20.400
Shit.

36:25.600 --> 36:27.240
Breathe. I'm here.

36:28.240 --> 36:29.320
I'm here, it's okay.

36:54.160 --> 37:00.040
British Airways flight 7110

37:00.160 --> 37:02.200
to La Coruña.

37:03.120 --> 37:05.120
Boarding is now open

37:05.240 --> 37:08.560
at gate D58.

37:17.120 --> 37:19.080
Don't move, you son of a bitch.

37:31.000 --> 37:32.080
I'll be out in ten years.

37:42.880 --> 37:43.880
Isabel.

37:45.800 --> 37:47.640
Please, don't do it.

37:52.000 --> 37:53.480
Put the gun down, please.

38:40.200 --> 38:41.200
How are you? Better?

38:42.080 --> 38:43.160
Yes.

38:45.720 --> 38:46.720
How are you?

38:47.200 --> 38:48.640
-Fine.
-Really?

38:49.160 --> 38:50.200
-Yes.
-Okay.

38:53.560 --> 38:55.080
You're not like other moms,
you know?

38:55.680 --> 38:56.680
I know.

38:57.800 --> 38:59.120
You deserve better, right?

39:02.000 --> 39:03.000
I don't know.

39:04.160 --> 39:06.640
I'd take you over anyone else
a thousand times.

39:09.840 --> 39:10.840
Just the way you are.

39:12.040 --> 39:13.920
At least life's never boring
with you, right?

39:15.880 --> 39:16.920
You're silly.

39:18.880 --> 39:19.920
Silly girl.

39:24.880 --> 39:26.320
Do you want pizza or a burger?

39:28.080 --> 39:30.040
I have to go to the station
for a while.

39:32.720 --> 39:34.080
Pizza it is, then.

39:40.120 --> 39:41.120
I love you so much.

39:45.040 --> 39:46.040
Yeah.

39:46.680 --> 39:47.680
Love you, too.

40:03.120 --> 40:04.120
Little one.

40:48.960 --> 40:50.960
YOU GAVE ME A REASON TO LIVE
I LOVE YOU

41:29.400 --> 41:30.400
Okay.

41:32.040 --> 41:33.040
Alright.

41:33.160 --> 41:34.160
Okay.

41:34.960 --> 41:35.960
Thank you.

41:36.600 --> 41:37.720
Goddammit, Haro.

41:38.840 --> 41:40.160
He's brain dead.

41:40.280 --> 41:41.920
The devil takes care of his own.

41:42.400 --> 41:43.440
The devil...

41:48.240 --> 41:50.240
Nieto, you coming to celebrate?

41:50.800 --> 41:52.560
No. I have too much to do here.

41:53.800 --> 41:54.800
Okay.

41:56.960 --> 41:59.480
-Who's that?
-What are you doing here?

42:01.120 --> 42:02.320
You should be resting.

42:02.880 --> 42:04.080
No, not yet.

42:06.360 --> 42:08.400
I'll rest when I have
all the answers,

42:08.520 --> 42:09.920
and I haven't found them yet.

42:12.080 --> 42:13.160
Roberto Plaza...

42:13.680 --> 42:14.960
has just slit his wrists.

42:17.000 --> 42:18.120
We found this.

42:21.440 --> 42:24.240
"You gave me a reason to live.
I love you."

42:28.120 --> 42:30.560
But... Plaza had no family.

42:31.360 --> 42:33.600
Well, this points to
a personal relationship.

42:35.800 --> 42:38.080
He told me he'd started
all this because of me.

42:39.920 --> 42:41.360
You were with him?

42:41.960 --> 42:42.960
Yes, at the lake house.

42:43.320 --> 42:45.000
At first, I thought
it was coincidence.

42:45.000 --> 42:45.080
At first, I thought
it was coincidence.
He said he'd ended up
holed up there at random

42:45.080 --> 42:47.520
He said he'd ended up
holed up there at random

42:47.680 --> 42:48.760
and it seemed strange.

42:49.960 --> 42:50.960
What?

42:52.280 --> 42:54.960
A few days ago,
there was a noise complaint

42:55.120 --> 42:56.520
at a boarding house downtown.

42:57.040 --> 42:58.000
Your mother was there.

42:59.520 --> 43:00.800
At the boarding house?

43:03.120 --> 43:04.320
A noise complaint?

43:05.760 --> 43:06.840
She was with a man.

43:07.840 --> 43:08.920
They didn't find out who.

43:09.680 --> 43:11.200
But it was where
Plaza was staying.

43:16.920 --> 43:19.800
PAROT CASE KILLER
TAKES HIS OWN LIFE

43:22.040 --> 43:23.120
Hi.

43:31.000 --> 43:32.000
How are you?

43:44.600 --> 43:45.800
I don't know where to start.

43:50.160 --> 43:52.560
Were you in love with him
or was it purely physical?

43:55.480 --> 43:56.720
No, we weren't lovers.

44:00.560 --> 44:03.240
I know you met up
at a boarding house in the city.

44:04.600 --> 44:06.600
Where we bumped into
each other that morning.

44:13.000 --> 44:14.600
Once, when I was very young,

44:16.160 --> 44:18.560
I read a line in a book.

44:20.160 --> 44:22.720
"If justice doesn't exist,
you have to make your own."

44:25.520 --> 44:29.040
I thought it was nonsense,
an awful thing to say.

44:32.040 --> 44:33.280
Then I had you,

44:35.000 --> 44:36.000
I raised you,

44:37.200 --> 44:38.280
helped you grow...

44:40.560 --> 44:42.240
You'd spend all day laughing

44:42.840 --> 44:44.600
and I couldn't wait to get home
from work

44:44.760 --> 44:46.280
just to hear your laughter.

44:48.920 --> 44:49.920
Until that day,

44:52.640 --> 44:54.560
when I found you
in the bathroom,

44:55.480 --> 44:57.080
after what he did to you.

45:01.440 --> 45:04.440
I seriously considered
killing him.

45:07.120 --> 45:08.640
But that makes us animals.

45:09.040 --> 45:11.400
The system is good,
it works.

45:24.720 --> 45:26.120
Mom, what are you saying?

45:29.480 --> 45:30.960
When the man who raped you

45:32.440 --> 45:35.280
was released
without serving his time...

45:35.520 --> 45:37.720
-Yes?
-...when a court decided

45:37.880 --> 45:39.840
that was alright,
that it was fair,

45:41.240 --> 45:43.760
that sentence
I'd read all those years ago...

45:44.480 --> 45:47.000
-Yes.
-...began to make sense to me.

45:49.320 --> 45:50.320
If justice...

45:51.520 --> 45:52.520
does not exist...

45:54.080 --> 45:55.440
you have to make your own.

45:59.480 --> 46:01.680
I've been working
with victims for years.

46:02.920 --> 46:04.000
I've seen their suffering.

46:05.240 --> 46:06.440
I've listened to them.

46:08.280 --> 46:12.000
I know the void, the devastation
left behind after...

46:12.280 --> 46:15.560
a murder, a rape or...
a massacre.

46:17.800 --> 46:19.320
You didn't know
he was the killer,

46:20.560 --> 46:21.560
right?

46:23.160 --> 46:25.080
Tell me you didn't know
he was the monkey.

46:28.120 --> 46:29.480
I told him to do it.

46:31.080 --> 46:32.080
I'm the criminal.

46:33.880 --> 46:35.920
The person responsible
for ending the lives

46:36.080 --> 46:38.040
of all those men... is me.

46:43.880 --> 46:45.720
No, no, no...

46:46.360 --> 46:47.360
No.

46:48.080 --> 46:49.440
He asked for my help

46:50.680 --> 46:51.680
and I used him.

46:54.960 --> 46:56.080
I gave him the mask,

46:57.120 --> 46:58.120
the targets...

47:01.520 --> 47:05.160
and...
the cards with the tagline.

47:06.320 --> 47:09.160
TIME SERVED

47:29.200 --> 47:30.680
-You have to arrest me.
-No.

47:31.120 --> 47:32.320
-You have to.
-No.

47:34.440 --> 47:36.480
I won't
and you can't ask me to do that.

47:43.880 --> 47:45.200
Because it's my fault.

47:46.120 --> 47:47.520
No.

47:48.240 --> 47:49.880
Don't you ever think that.

47:50.880 --> 47:51.880
You are...

47:52.320 --> 47:53.480
You're my life.

47:54.360 --> 47:56.040
The thing I love most
in the world.

47:56.800 --> 47:58.280
My girl, my love.

48:00.000 --> 48:01.080
But I did this.

48:04.400 --> 48:05.640
I don't want to lose you.

48:06.440 --> 48:07.920
No, you won't lose me.

48:08.160 --> 48:09.880
I don't want to lose you.

48:12.000 --> 48:14.640
Think of all
the good times we've had.

48:17.200 --> 48:19.000
Nobody can take that
away from us.

48:21.040 --> 48:22.040
Come here.

48:25.560 --> 48:26.560
That's it.

48:27.240 --> 48:29.240
Everything will turn out fine,
you'll see.

48:29.400 --> 48:30.760
Okay.

48:36.440 --> 48:37.520
I love you.

48:41.840 --> 48:43.120
I love you too, honey.

48:43.360 --> 48:44.360
I love you.

48:53.960 --> 48:56.320
-Have you seen the file on...?
-Yes, check...

49:15.040 --> 49:16.040
Mom?

49:22.040 --> 49:23.040
Mom?

49:33.080 --> 49:34.080
Excuse me.

49:35.040 --> 49:36.040
Hello.

49:40.040 --> 49:41.560
Do you remember
when you asked me

49:41.680 --> 49:44.320
how you could justify murder
and live with it?

49:46.400 --> 49:47.440
You can't.

51:21.080 --> 51:22.080
He's nothing now.

51:25.120 --> 51:26.240
-It's all over.
-No.

51:27.080 --> 51:28.080
He's still alive.

51:29.160 --> 51:30.600
This isn't living.

51:36.040 --> 51:37.080
I could disconnect him.

51:38.120 --> 51:39.120
You could.

51:40.400 --> 51:41.520
-But you won't.
-No.

51:44.840 --> 51:47.440
One member of the family in jail
is more than enough.

51:50.200 --> 51:52.200
Yes, more than enough.

51:53.560 --> 51:54.600
Someone has to be free,

51:54.760 --> 51:56.520
to take your mom
her key lime pie.

51:59.840 --> 52:02.080
You think this is a good time
to make jokes?

52:02.880 --> 52:03.880
Absolutely.

52:08.200 --> 52:09.200
And now what?

52:12.400 --> 52:13.400
Now?

52:19.240 --> 52:21.560
It might not be the best time
for what I'm thinking.

52:21.720 --> 52:22.720
Say it.

52:27.480 --> 52:28.960
How about dinner at my place?

52:30.120 --> 52:31.480
That's what you wanted to say?

52:33.000 --> 52:34.000
No.

52:35.760 --> 52:38.800
That would be the most surreal
declaration of love I've heard.

52:41.080 --> 52:44.440
The setting and the beeping
don't help but...

52:45.720 --> 52:46.920
-life isn't perfect.
-No.

52:48.120 --> 52:49.760
And if you have to wait
for it to be,

52:50.520 --> 52:52.200
you end up with nothing,
it passes you by.

52:53.000 --> 52:54.240
My mom used to tell me that.

52:58.920 --> 52:59.920
-Shall we go?
-No.

53:02.400 --> 53:04.040
Wait outside a second.
I'll be right out.

53:29.720 --> 53:30.720
I won.

53:36.280 --> 53:39.120
I'm going to be happy.
