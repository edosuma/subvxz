WEBVTT

00:03.162 --> 00:04.890
Morgan, Morgan!

00:05.023 --> 00:07.514
Oh, Colette, where is Morgan
with my breakfast gordita?

00:07.515 --> 00:09.560
I had my doughnut hours ago.

00:09.585 --> 00:10.997
I can feel my blood sugar plummeting.

00:11.022 --> 00:13.581
Check Phlebotomy.
He and Tamra are canoodling.

00:13.606 --> 00:15.234
It's so unprofessional.

00:15.259 --> 00:17.325
I'm having to clean my cleats out here.

00:20.834 --> 00:22.670
Aw, ooh,
themed ideas... is it too late...

00:22.671 --> 00:24.799
There you are. Morgan, what the hell?

00:24.800 --> 00:27.621
Where's my breakfast?
I'm feeling extremely faint.

00:27.646 --> 00:29.649
If I fall asleep on a patient,
that's on you.

00:29.650 --> 00:32.113
Ooh, sorry, Dr. L. He's really busy.

00:32.113 --> 00:34.826
We're planning our wedding on
interracialweddingplanner.com.

00:34.827 --> 00:36.455
Black and white cookies!

00:36.456 --> 00:38.208
- Yes, yes!
- That's a good idea.

00:38.209 --> 00:40.212
I'm so sorry.
It's just, when you're staring

00:40.213 --> 00:43.343
into your beloved's eyes,
time just melts away.

00:43.344 --> 00:46.183
So am I supposed to eat
your love for my breakfast?

00:46.184 --> 00:49.898
Beverly's got a bag of really
wet carrots in the fridge.

00:49.899 --> 00:51.485
She said, "Have at it."

00:51.486 --> 00:53.739
I don't think they're wet from water.

00:55.577 --> 00:56.996
- Hi.
- Oh, my God, did you see

00:56.997 --> 00:58.582
"The Bachelorette" last night?

00:58.583 --> 01:00.294
I'm sure she's gonna pick
Chris Harrison.

01:00.295 --> 01:02.757
I'm afraid I'm a bit behind
on my "Bach."

01:02.758 --> 01:05.471
Anna and I will start
a conversation about Magritte.

01:05.471 --> 01:07.308
Before we know it, it's the dawn.

01:07.309 --> 01:09.479
Why is everyone so in love
and not their normal,

01:09.480 --> 01:11.149
dorky selves where
they were desperate enough

01:11.150 --> 01:12.860
- to hang out with me?
- Why don't you come over

01:12.861 --> 01:15.282
to mine and Anna's?
We could play charades.

01:15.283 --> 01:17.161
You don't have a partner. Wait.

01:17.162 --> 01:19.082
You could be partners with Roger.

01:19.083 --> 01:21.878
I am not going to be partners
with your stupid bird.

01:21.879 --> 01:24.634
Mindy, since you are alone,
maybe you should

01:24.635 --> 01:26.513
consider getting a bird.

01:26.514 --> 01:29.143
You can teach it to peck 9-1-1
if you start to choke.

01:29.144 --> 01:31.565
- Please, leave.
- Yes, understandable.

01:38.956 --> 01:42.878
Oh, hey, Pepe. It's so great to see you.

01:42.879 --> 01:44.799
It's hard when
all of your friends pair up

01:44.800 --> 01:46.052
and don't have time for you anymore.

01:47.139 --> 01:49.350
Thanks, I needed that.

01:49.351 --> 01:50.686
I know, at least, you'll never leave me.

01:51.856 --> 01:53.775
Aah, who the hell is this?

01:53.776 --> 01:55.404
Pepe, she's so basic.

01:55.405 --> 01:57.825
Hey, Dr. L, oh, hey, Pepe, hey, Doreen.

01:57.826 --> 02:00.372
- Aren't they such a cute couple?
- I think he can do better.

02:00.373 --> 02:02.835
- What's up?
- I have exciting news.

02:02.836 --> 02:06.301
Shine your sunglasses...
you're going on vacation.

02:06.302 --> 02:08.138
- Vacation?
- I just got an email

02:08.139 --> 02:10.684
from hotdeals.darkweb.com...
that's where

02:10.685 --> 02:12.855
your ex-husband Ben
booked your honeymoon.

02:12.856 --> 02:15.110
- The trip's next week.
- My honeymoon?

02:15.111 --> 02:16.946
Ben didn't cancel it?

02:16.947 --> 02:18.993
Sure was fast to take me off
his Postmates account.

02:18.994 --> 02:20.329
No, just get a refund. I'm not going.

02:20.330 --> 02:22.833
Mm, it's non-refundable.

02:22.834 --> 02:25.297
You know, if Ben's not going,
maybe you could take

02:25.298 --> 02:27.551
your favorite receptionist.

02:27.552 --> 02:30.432
I am not taking you
on my honeymoon with me.

02:30.433 --> 02:32.019
And I am not going on a honeymoon alone.

02:32.020 --> 02:33.897
That's not the kind of pitiful I am.

02:33.898 --> 02:36.653
I guess I'll unpack my bags
and just give up my dream

02:36.654 --> 02:38.323
of flying on a plane!

02:45.088 --> 02:46.631
Oh, hey, Graciela.

02:46.632 --> 02:48.635
Miss Mindy, I have exciting news.

02:48.636 --> 02:50.931
Is it another Jesus pamphlet?
I read it already.

02:50.932 --> 02:52.643
I thought it was unrealistic.

02:52.644 --> 02:57.319
No, little Leo has his first girlfriend.

02:57.320 --> 02:58.739
What? Even my son

02:58.740 --> 03:00.242
is in a relationship?

03:00.243 --> 03:02.079
I mean, I shouldn't be surprised,

03:02.080 --> 03:04.459
with those dreamy eyes
and caramel skin, but still.

03:04.460 --> 03:06.379
When did I become such a loser?

03:06.380 --> 03:08.968
If I don't find someone,
I'm gonna be alone forever.

03:08.969 --> 03:10.804
Okay, you know what, Graciela?

03:10.805 --> 03:12.933
Tomorrow, I want to drop
Leo off at his father's house.

03:12.934 --> 03:15.564
I am going on my honeymoon by myself.

03:15.565 --> 03:17.818
I don't even know where it is,
but I'm gonna tear

03:17.819 --> 03:22.578
that ish up and find me a man.
#One-ymoon.

03:22.579 --> 03:26.127
Starring Melissa McCarthy, this summer,

03:26.128 --> 03:28.966
one is the horniest number.

03:37.275 --> 03:39.195
Ah, a window seat,

03:39.196 --> 03:41.366
a ticket for Boise, Idaho,

03:41.367 --> 03:45.123
and I beat my two seat mates
so I can steal their pillows.

03:45.124 --> 03:47.294
Hey, are you stealing my pillow?

03:47.295 --> 03:50.717
No, no, I was fluffing it for you.

03:50.718 --> 03:53.598
Oh, nice try, though
I would've tried to steal yours

03:53.599 --> 03:54.600
if I'd gotten here first.

03:56.730 --> 03:59.652
Oh, typical, I got the broken one.

03:59.653 --> 04:02.324
Would it be okay
if I watched yours with you?

04:02.325 --> 04:04.120
As long as you don't mind
watching "Boss Baby."

04:04.121 --> 04:05.789
Mind? It is my favorite movie.

04:05.790 --> 04:07.293
I have it memorized.

04:07.294 --> 04:09.213
- Hey, I'm...
- Excuse me, excuse me.

04:09.214 --> 04:11.551
Hello, looks like I'm in the middle.

04:11.552 --> 04:13.054
Uh, you know what?

04:13.055 --> 04:14.599
I don't mind sitting in the middle.

04:14.600 --> 04:16.310
Oh, nah, I don't like getting bumped

04:16.312 --> 04:17.438
by the drink cart,
and looking out the window

04:17.439 --> 04:19.024
makes me dizzy.

04:19.026 --> 04:20.902
Oh, I'm Martha, by the way.

04:20.903 --> 04:23.450
He's handsome, isn't he?

04:23.451 --> 04:25.078
Little too young for us though.

04:26.874 --> 04:28.418
I feel like I'm getting
a little bit of a cold.

04:34.974 --> 04:37.853
What is this show about, do you think?

04:37.854 --> 04:39.941
I bet it'd be easy to tell
if you put your headphones on.

04:39.942 --> 04:42.404
Nah, it's more fun to guess.

04:42.405 --> 04:45.035
What are you reading?
Is it the new James Patterson?

04:45.036 --> 04:47.373
No one does violence
against women like him.

04:47.374 --> 04:49.835
It's called "Wild."
It's by Reese Witherspoon.

04:49.836 --> 04:51.506
I've only read the table of contents,

04:51.507 --> 04:54.095
but I think it's about
a hot woman going on

04:54.096 --> 04:56.224
an outdoorsy vacation
and having a sexy adventure,

04:56.225 --> 04:57.685
which is kind of what I'm about to do.

04:57.686 --> 04:59.313
Mm-hmm, but does she solve crimes?

04:59.314 --> 05:01.734
I like it when they solve crimes.

05:01.735 --> 05:05.242
You know what?
I'm gonna put on my headphones.

05:08.791 --> 05:11.379
They're not plugged into anything.

05:14.803 --> 05:17.641
Oh, thank God, I was on the worst flight

05:17.642 --> 05:19.770
with the chattiest, most annoying woman.

05:19.771 --> 05:22.234
Two Turtles, Two Turtles!

05:22.235 --> 05:24.905
Ah! what are the chances?

05:24.906 --> 05:26.075
You're also going to Two Turtles?

05:26.076 --> 05:27.911
- Mm-hmm.
- You know what?

05:27.912 --> 05:29.457
I'm gonna catch the next van.
I really want to try

05:29.458 --> 05:31.502
- the Togo's here.
- This is the only van,

05:31.503 --> 05:33.506
and this neighborhood gets real
James Patterson-y at night,

05:33.507 --> 05:35.802
- if you know what I mean.
- I do.

05:35.803 --> 05:37.806
Come on, I'll save you a seat
right next to me.

05:39.000 --> 05:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:49.039 --> 05:51.209
Wow, it's so beautiful.

05:51.210 --> 05:53.088
I feel like I'm in a screensaver.

05:53.089 --> 05:55.425
Or the background of karaoke lyrics.

05:55.426 --> 05:57.429
I had to go through hell
to get to heaven,

05:57.430 --> 05:59.100
but, man, was it worth it.

05:59.101 --> 06:01.312
Two Turtles resort, do your thing.

06:02.941 --> 06:04.902
Oh, my God, you stepped on Victor!

06:04.903 --> 06:06.405
Victor? Who Victor?

06:06.406 --> 06:08.034
He's the turtle you almost just crushed!

06:08.035 --> 06:09.870
He's one of the eponymous turtles

06:09.871 --> 06:11.624
of the Two Turtles Resort
and Healthy Living Retreat.

06:11.625 --> 06:13.253
Oh, my God, I thought
he was a hockey puck.

06:13.254 --> 06:15.048
His shell cracked, oh, God!

06:15.049 --> 06:16.801
He was run over by a truck
and it stayed intact.

06:16.802 --> 06:19.014
- What did you do?
- I barely even saw him.

06:19.015 --> 06:21.310
He's so tiny and quiet.

06:21.311 --> 06:23.273
Medic, I need a medic!

06:23.274 --> 06:24.985
Oh, thank God, all right,
patch up his shell

06:24.986 --> 06:26.445
and calm him down,
but do not let Victoria

06:26.446 --> 06:27.906
see him like this, okay?

06:27.907 --> 06:29.285
The other turtle will be very upset.

06:29.286 --> 06:30.453
Just put a Valium in her lettuce

06:30.454 --> 06:32.250
and bring one to me.

06:33.794 --> 06:35.589
We got off on a rocky start,

06:35.590 --> 06:39.430
but my name's Mindy, and
I am here for my one-ymoon,

06:39.431 --> 06:41.350
- which is kind of my way to...
- Look, you know what?

06:41.351 --> 06:42.979
I'm gonna stop you right there.
I really can't process

06:42.980 --> 06:44.523
whatever it is you're talking about

06:44.524 --> 06:46.235
because I'm still PTSDing from when you

06:46.236 --> 06:48.656
- almost crushed Victor.
- Can I go to my room?

06:48.657 --> 06:50.577
Best if I take you there.

06:50.578 --> 06:52.414
You have to be very careful
where you step, all right?

06:52.415 --> 06:55.170
We got a lot of wildlife,
and you have a heavy tread.

06:55.171 --> 06:56.965
- Follow me.
- Thank you.

06:59.972 --> 07:02.142
And here we are.

07:02.143 --> 07:04.855
Oh, hey, Brett, I can't use a twin bed.

07:04.856 --> 07:06.233
I'm planning on having company. Wink.

07:07.695 --> 07:09.490
Who are we having over, roomie?

07:09.491 --> 07:11.577
What? I'm sharing a room with Martha?

07:11.578 --> 07:13.456
Well, your receptionist
sent us a long note saying

07:13.457 --> 07:14.833
you were gonna come here
all alone, so we put you

07:14.834 --> 07:16.420
in a double room.

07:16.421 --> 07:18.007
It's peak season for us,
so we need to keep

07:18.008 --> 07:19.510
the king beds open
for people in committed,

07:19.511 --> 07:20.845
romantic, fulfilling relationships.

07:20.846 --> 07:22.432
- Okay.
- That seems fair.

07:22.433 --> 07:23.935
Yeah, but don't even worry about it.

07:23.936 --> 07:25.772
We're barely gonna be in the room.

07:25.773 --> 07:27.442
We're gonna be out hiking,
doing yoga, spelunking,

07:27.443 --> 07:28.861
- climbing Mount Diablo.
- Okay, yeah, Brett,

07:28.862 --> 07:31.075
I ain't climbing no Mount Diablo.

07:31.076 --> 07:33.538
No, this is my one-ymoon,
so I'm mostly gonna be

07:33.539 --> 07:35.750
staying here, watching TV,
surfing the Internet...

07:35.751 --> 07:37.754
Oof, hate to break it to you,
but we do not have

07:37.755 --> 07:39.133
Internet or TV.

07:39.134 --> 07:40.970
I find the chaos of the campfire

07:40.971 --> 07:42.681
infinitely more interesting
than any television show.

07:42.682 --> 07:43.933
I'll see you guys
at the smoothie social.

07:43.934 --> 07:45.437
I hope you like bitter greens.

07:45.438 --> 07:47.691
- Bye, Brett.
- Oh, come on.

07:47.692 --> 07:49.361
Okay, you know what, Martha?

07:49.362 --> 07:51.449
I'm just gonna stay here
and play on my phone.

07:51.450 --> 07:53.244
- Oh.
- What?

07:53.245 --> 07:55.540
I'm out of data? Oh, what the hell?

07:55.541 --> 07:57.461
Ugh, I wish I knew how to close my apps.

07:57.462 --> 07:59.548
Here, I have Sprint Unlimited.

07:59.549 --> 08:00.842
- Oh, works for me.
- Mm-hmm.

08:00.843 --> 08:02.554
Oh, sweet data. Thank you.

08:02.555 --> 08:03.723
I'm just gonna hold on
to this phone for as long

08:03.724 --> 08:05.351
as I possibly can.

08:05.352 --> 08:06.980
- Mm...
- Why would my ex-husband think

08:06.981 --> 08:08.649
I would even like this place?

08:08.650 --> 08:10.612
Well, maybe that's why
he's your ex-husband.

08:10.613 --> 08:12.407
You know what, Martha?

08:12.408 --> 08:13.952
I don't need your incisive
commentary right now.

08:13.953 --> 08:16.332
I just wish I was on vacation, you know?

08:16.333 --> 08:17.793
I wanted a mani-pedi,

08:17.794 --> 08:19.671
I wanted to pass out at the pool bar,

08:19.672 --> 08:21.550
maybe get talked into trying cocaine.

08:21.551 --> 08:23.429
Yeah, I call dibs on that bed.

08:23.430 --> 08:24.890
Martha, you're gonna be
in the other bed,

08:24.891 --> 08:27.104
because it's closer to the bathroom.

08:27.105 --> 08:28.982
Mm. Smells weird.

08:28.983 --> 08:30.318
It seems like you're already using it.

08:30.319 --> 08:31.737
True.

08:33.200 --> 08:34.493
Whoa. There are actually

08:34.494 --> 08:36.038
some hot guys here,

08:36.039 --> 08:38.961
in an outdoorsy,
UVA sex scandal-type way.

08:38.962 --> 08:40.922
Hmm, I guess even at a health retreat

08:40.923 --> 08:44.388
you can still have a romantic awakening.

08:44.389 --> 08:46.559
Damn it, everybody's coupled up.

08:46.560 --> 08:49.064
Wife, wife, boyfriend, wife.

08:49.065 --> 08:51.652
Excuse me, crazy woman
talking to herself.

08:51.653 --> 08:53.364
- Casey?
- Brought you a smoothie.

08:53.365 --> 08:54.783
Thank you. What are you doing here?

08:54.784 --> 08:56.620
What am I doing here?

08:56.621 --> 08:58.332
Uh, I like this kind of stuff.
What are you doing here?

08:58.333 --> 08:59.877
I remember one time, in bed, you told me

08:59.878 --> 09:01.547
- you were scared of trees.
- Oh, no, no, no.

09:01.548 --> 09:03.801
I'm not scared of trees.
I hate trees, and I think

09:03.802 --> 09:05.638
they should be turned into tables.

09:05.639 --> 09:07.350
I'm having trouble
concentrating on your hot take

09:07.351 --> 09:09.396
on trees because you got
a little smoothie mustache

09:09.397 --> 09:11.108
right there. I got it.

09:17.705 --> 09:19.291
You know, Casey,
why don't we go to your room

09:19.292 --> 09:20.543
- and catch up a little?
- Hey, sweetie.

09:20.544 --> 09:22.339
Hey, Babe.

09:22.340 --> 09:25.136
Mindy, this is my wife,
Babe Chen-Peerson.

09:25.137 --> 09:28.226
- Your actual name is Babe?
- Yeah, so my parents

09:28.227 --> 09:29.853
named me after
their favorite movie, "Babe,"

09:29.854 --> 09:32.692
because we were released
the same year, 1995.

09:32.693 --> 09:34.446
- Yeah.
- You're 22 years old,

09:34.447 --> 09:36.575
and you're married?
I hadn't even kissed a guy

09:36.576 --> 09:38.412
at that age.

09:38.413 --> 09:40.166
Isn't she hilarious? This is the woman

09:40.167 --> 09:42.254
I was telling you about.
We were actually engaged

09:42.255 --> 09:43.881
- about five years ago.
- Oh, when I was

09:43.882 --> 09:46.136
- in high school.
- Yeah, yeah, but Mindy's

09:46.137 --> 09:48.099
- married too, right?
- Yeah, you know, I left him

09:48.100 --> 09:50.895
- in New York, but, um...
- They got divorced.

09:50.896 --> 09:52.774
Gorp? I ate all the chocolate chips,

09:52.775 --> 09:54.778
- so it's mostly filberts.
- It's okay.

09:54.779 --> 09:56.448
Mindy, I'm real sorry
to hear about that,

09:56.449 --> 09:57.826
but it looks like
you've rebounded nicely.

09:57.827 --> 09:59.329
You guys are a cute couple.

09:59.330 --> 10:02.127
No, no, I'm not... I'm not with her.

10:02.128 --> 10:03.796
You know what? I'm tired.

10:03.797 --> 10:05.800
I'm gonna go back to my room,
hit the hay,

10:05.801 --> 10:07.804
maybe check for flights out
of here, slit my wrists, so...

10:07.805 --> 10:08.889
- Okay.
- Oh,

10:08.890 --> 10:09.976
sorry about your divorce.

10:09.977 --> 10:10.979
Thank you.

10:15.209 --> 10:17.393
Yeah, this is a red oak,
and this is a white oak.

10:17.418 --> 10:18.558
- You can tell by the leaves.
- Oh.

10:18.583 --> 10:20.815
- You see that?
- It's not red or white though.

10:20.840 --> 10:22.678
Exactly, yeah, they're green.

10:22.703 --> 10:24.630
- Hey, Brett?
- Oh, yeah?

10:24.631 --> 10:25.784
When is the hike over?

10:25.809 --> 10:27.268
Over? This is the trailhead.

10:27.293 --> 10:29.212
- We're just starting.
- Wait, then what did we just do?

10:29.237 --> 10:31.602
The very short walk
from the parking lot?

10:31.603 --> 10:33.189
I lost a toe nail!

10:35.110 --> 10:38.032
Psst, here, bought 'em
off a cleaning lady.

10:38.033 --> 10:39.910
$10 a pop, so...

10:39.911 --> 10:42.040
Thank you so much. I'm starving.

10:42.041 --> 10:44.294
- Yeah.
- Wow.

10:44.295 --> 10:45.755
Just one?

10:45.756 --> 10:47.676
No, that's great. I love it.

10:47.702 --> 10:49.447
Oh, yours has peanut better
chips in it, huh?

10:49.472 --> 10:51.308
No, this is so generous. I love it.

10:51.309 --> 10:52.769
- Thank you, thank you so much.
- You're welcome, great.

10:52.770 --> 10:54.564
- Yeah.
- Okay, everybody,

10:54.565 --> 10:57.946
we're gonna get started before
the rattlesnakes wake up.

10:57.947 --> 10:59.199
You know what?
I should not have shouted that.

10:59.200 --> 11:00.227
They are now awake.

11:00.252 --> 11:01.955
Let's go, let's go. Come on.

11:01.956 --> 11:05.963
Let's hop to it. Keep your feet high.

11:05.964 --> 11:09.136
Oh, right there we got
some mule deer droppings.

11:09.137 --> 11:11.181
- That's nice.
- I was ovulating last night,

11:11.182 --> 11:12.977
and yet, when I came back
from brushing my teeth,

11:12.978 --> 11:14.855
- you were snoring your head off.
- Okay, I'm sorry.

11:14.856 --> 11:16.400
I was tired. You had to watch

11:16.401 --> 11:18.112
another episode of "House of Cards."

11:18.113 --> 11:20.032
You're always tired.
I guess that's what I get

11:20.033 --> 11:22.495
- for marrying a much older guy.
- Okay, you know what?

11:22.496 --> 11:25.209
We talked about this.
Age is different for men.

11:25.210 --> 11:27.046
Yes, you are 15 years
younger than me, but

11:27.047 --> 11:29.468
in the eyes of society,
I'm younger than you.

11:29.469 --> 11:30.971
Whatever. You know what?

11:30.972 --> 11:32.932
Since I'm not tired, I'm gonna hike up

11:32.933 --> 11:34.603
to that South American couple
because I bet they had sex

11:34.604 --> 11:36.815
- last night.
- Every South American couple

11:36.816 --> 11:40.531
has sex every night. You can't compare.

11:40.532 --> 11:43.788
Martha, Martha, Martha,
trouble in paradise.

11:43.789 --> 11:45.458
I guess they're not having sex.

11:45.459 --> 11:47.545
He never had that problem
when he was with me.

11:47.546 --> 11:49.967
Is Casey the guy or the girl?

11:49.968 --> 11:51.971
And yet you can tell birds apart?

11:51.972 --> 11:54.267
He's the guy. Ugh, Martha.

11:54.268 --> 11:56.897
Kind of girl's name, Mindy.

11:56.898 --> 11:58.484
If we're lucky, we'll see a bear.

11:58.485 --> 12:00.196
- If we're lucky.
- Oh, good.

12:00.197 --> 12:02.826
Okay, guys, the straggler caught up.

12:02.827 --> 12:04.704
We can go now. Break's over.

12:04.705 --> 12:06.875
No, no, no, I need a break,
more than these people

12:06.876 --> 12:08.838
- 'cause I'm the worst one.
- Yeah, but we've been here

12:08.839 --> 12:10.716
for seven or eight minutes,
and if we wait any longer,

12:10.717 --> 12:12.387
we're gonna cramp up.
I can already feel that

12:12.388 --> 12:14.307
lactic acid building
in my calves, come on.

12:14.308 --> 12:15.978
You know what?

12:15.979 --> 12:17.772
I don't mind hanging back,
Brett... in fact,

12:17.773 --> 12:19.401
I've got some experience
tricking Mindy into moving.

12:19.402 --> 12:21.280
I'll just tell her that Oscar Isaac's

12:21.281 --> 12:23.242
- on top of the mountain.
- What? Oscar Isaac's here?

12:23.243 --> 12:24.954
- Where?
- See?

12:24.955 --> 12:26.582
Sorry, guys, I can't let you do that.

12:26.583 --> 12:28.252
It's a big part of Two Turtles resort

12:28.253 --> 12:29.796
to leave the weakest behind,

12:29.797 --> 12:30.882
see if they can fend for themselves.

12:30.883 --> 12:32.385
- Really?
- Yeah.

12:32.386 --> 12:34.014
The resort was founded by Ayn Rand.

12:34.015 --> 12:35.182
Look, all you have to do
is follow the trail

12:35.183 --> 12:37.061
to the waterfall, okay?

12:37.062 --> 12:38.939
It's the easiest thing
I've ever asked anybody to do.

12:38.940 --> 12:40.860
Yeah, but what if I see a rattlesnake?

12:40.861 --> 12:43.198
Well, you won't see them
as much as you'll hear them,

12:43.199 --> 12:45.077
but by then it's too late.

12:45.078 --> 12:46.663
Okay, folks, as I was saying,

12:46.664 --> 12:48.500
this area is called Rattlesnake Gulch.

12:56.935 --> 12:59.940
Oh, great. A fork in the road?

12:59.941 --> 13:01.693
Ugh, no signal.

13:01.694 --> 13:03.447
Okay, Mindy, left or right?

13:03.448 --> 13:05.910
I know I'm looking for a waterfall.

13:05.911 --> 13:08.874
"Don't go chasing waterfalls," TLC.

13:08.875 --> 13:12.173
Lisa "Left Eye" Lopes, left.

13:12.174 --> 13:14.386
I could be a trail guide.

13:18.269 --> 13:21.817
I've been walking for hours,
and no sign of any waterfall.

13:21.818 --> 13:24.489
It's so hot. I'm so thirsty.

13:24.490 --> 13:26.576
Should I drink my own pee?

13:26.577 --> 13:28.622
Ooh, a cave. Maybe I can cool off

13:28.623 --> 13:30.584
and come up with a plan,
or a bear will share

13:30.585 --> 13:31.920
its honey with me.

13:31.921 --> 13:35.678
Ah... aah!

13:42.986 --> 13:46.450
Oh, God, my ponytail's stuck.

13:46.451 --> 13:49.080
Help, help!

13:49.081 --> 13:51.376
Somebody help me!

13:53.006 --> 13:55.426
Oh, God, I must be getting delirious.

13:55.427 --> 13:58.515
I'm starting to question some of
the choices I've made in my life.

13:58.516 --> 14:00.144
Hey, it's your girl, Mindy.

14:00.145 --> 14:03.233
Coming to you live
from a cave I fell into.

14:03.234 --> 14:05.821
I can't get any Internet,
so whoever finds me

14:05.822 --> 14:08.118
and my phone,
you'll have to upload it later.

14:08.119 --> 14:11.416
And if I die, tell Leo I love him.

14:11.417 --> 14:13.754
And tell Morgan to clear
my search history.

14:13.755 --> 14:14.756
Hey!

14:14.757 --> 14:15.883
Who's there?

14:15.884 --> 14:17.345
Snap out of it!

14:17.346 --> 14:20.768
Oh, my God, Reese Witherspoon?

14:20.769 --> 14:22.563
What are you doing here
in the middle of the woods?

14:22.564 --> 14:24.734
Oh, no, you're in rehab.

14:24.735 --> 14:26.446
I knew it. You know what?

14:26.447 --> 14:28.116
If you can help me out of here,
I will write you

14:28.117 --> 14:30.079
a prescription for whatever you want.

14:30.080 --> 14:32.750
No, I am here to teach you
some hard truths, dummy.

14:32.751 --> 14:35.214
Hard truths? No, no, pass.

14:35.215 --> 14:39.013
I choose dare. I dare you to kiss me.

14:39.014 --> 14:40.516
You're my celebrity hall pass.

14:40.517 --> 14:41.768
Oh, that's so weird 'cause you're

14:41.769 --> 14:43.355
my non-celebrity hall pass.

14:43.356 --> 14:45.442
- Really?
- No, that's not a thing.

14:45.443 --> 14:47.655
And besides, why do you need
a celebrity hall pass?

14:47.656 --> 14:49.075
You're not even dating anybody.

14:49.076 --> 14:50.828
You're divorced and single.

14:50.829 --> 14:53.000
Damn, Reese Witherspoon,
that's cold as hell.

14:53.001 --> 14:54.878
I thought you were supposed
to be America's sweetheart.

14:54.879 --> 14:56.923
I thought you were supposed
to give me advice like,

14:56.924 --> 14:59.929
"I will find my one true love
if I give up my big city ways

14:59.930 --> 15:01.725
and go back to my down home roots."

15:01.726 --> 15:03.520
Is that the plot
of "Sweet Home Alabama"?

15:03.521 --> 15:05.357
- Yeah.
- That is a movie.

15:05.358 --> 15:08.030
- Movies aren't real, Mindy.
- Okay, well, if movies

15:08.031 --> 15:09.908
aren't real, what about this one?

15:09.909 --> 15:11.786
It's called "Wild."
It says it's based on

15:11.787 --> 15:13.373
- a true story.
- Mm-hmm.

15:13.374 --> 15:15.461
- Did you ready it?
- No, I bought it because

15:15.462 --> 15:16.922
you were on the cover, and I really like

15:16.923 --> 15:18.592
this bob hairstyle on you.

15:18.593 --> 15:20.512
If you had read it or watched the movie,

15:20.513 --> 15:22.683
you would know that life
isn't about finding a man.

15:22.684 --> 15:24.312
It's about finding yourself.

15:24.313 --> 15:25.689
Why would I need to find myself?

15:25.690 --> 15:28.528
I know where I am... Idaho. Iowa?

15:28.529 --> 15:30.240
- Ohio?
- Life is not like

15:30.241 --> 15:32.620
the movies, Mindy.
You can't get into Harvard

15:32.621 --> 15:34.916
Law School by submitting
a video tape of yourself

15:34.917 --> 15:37.088
in a bikini. They also don't shut down

15:37.089 --> 15:39.384
all of Tiffany's
for one wedding proposal.

15:39.385 --> 15:41.763
And sometimes life
doesn't have a happy ending.

15:41.764 --> 15:43.684
How dare you?

15:43.685 --> 15:47.733
Your movies are a bunch of
lies, and I demand a refund

15:47.734 --> 15:49.445
for every ticket that I've ever bought

15:49.446 --> 15:51.658
to your films...
and for "Failure to Launch,"

15:51.659 --> 15:53.245
which you weren't even in.

15:53.246 --> 15:55.207
You know what?
I am gonna leave you here.

15:55.208 --> 15:56.876
You clearly have a lot
of thinking to do.

15:56.877 --> 15:58.839
You've already done a lot of farting.

15:58.840 --> 16:00.759
No, that's sulfur... I think
it's sulfur from the ground.

16:00.760 --> 16:02.930
- It's disgusting.
- You know what, Reese?

16:02.931 --> 16:04.767
If you can't help me, can you at least

16:04.768 --> 16:06.354
run back to the resort
and grab me a soda, not diet?

16:06.355 --> 16:08.316
I'm sorry, Mindy... I'm an apparition.

16:08.317 --> 16:10.070
The real Reese Witherspoon
is wandering around

16:10.071 --> 16:11.906
Brentwood Country Mart
trying to remember

16:11.907 --> 16:13.577
where she parked her car.

16:13.578 --> 16:15.497
You're gonna have to
save yourself, Mindy.

16:15.498 --> 16:16.499
Good-bye.

16:16.500 --> 16:18.086
Reese, no!

16:18.087 --> 16:20.299
What a bad celebrity hallucination.

16:20.300 --> 16:21.760
At least she looked hot.

16:21.761 --> 16:24.849
Damn it, my hair's really stuck.

16:24.850 --> 16:27.480
Okay, there's gotta be
something in my bag

16:27.481 --> 16:29.776
that can chip away at this rock.

16:29.777 --> 16:31.946
Fidget spinner, fidget spinner.

16:33.743 --> 16:36.039
Toe nail clipper.

16:47.585 --> 16:49.914
I hope everyone's
enjoying the classy wine mixer

16:49.939 --> 16:52.029
while this woman of color
was left for dead.

16:52.030 --> 16:54.534
Oh, hey, Martha, great to see you.

16:54.535 --> 16:56.079
What the hell? You're my roommate.

16:56.080 --> 16:57.373
You didn't try to come find me?

16:57.374 --> 16:59.502
I am so sorry. For a while,

16:59.503 --> 17:01.923
I thought I heard you behind
me, but it turned out to be

17:01.924 --> 17:03.760
a weasel with indigestion.

17:03.761 --> 17:06.015
Well, I almost died alone
in the wilderness, so...

17:06.016 --> 17:08.019
Hey, you made it. Cool haircut.

17:08.020 --> 17:09.730
I really thought you were
gonna be a statistic.

17:09.731 --> 17:11.358
Wow, you did miss the s'mores though.

17:11.359 --> 17:12.819
I'm sorry.

17:12.820 --> 17:14.323
We have one graham cracker left.

17:14.324 --> 17:15.576
No marshmallow or chocolate though.

17:15.577 --> 17:16.786
I should not have come here.

17:16.787 --> 17:18.248
Reese Witherspoon was right.

17:18.249 --> 17:20.210
There is no happy ending
for a single mom

17:20.211 --> 17:21.964
in her 30s looking for love.

17:21.964 --> 17:24.510
The world belongs to
20-somethings and turtles.

17:24.511 --> 17:26.388
Peace.

17:33.362 --> 17:35.407
Hi, sir, do you mind
putting this in the trunk?

17:35.408 --> 17:37.036
We're not supposed to do that.

17:37.037 --> 17:39.207
I could hurt my back
and sue the company.

17:39.208 --> 17:40.417
Can't your husband do it?

17:45.637 --> 17:47.681
Babe, you're reading
way too much into this.

17:47.682 --> 17:49.894
Well, I'm done ovulating,
and we've missed another month.

17:49.895 --> 17:52.149
Now our baby's gonna have
a summer birthday.

17:52.150 --> 17:54.028
He won't get cupcakes at school.

17:54.029 --> 17:55.489
You know what? It's the altitude.

17:55.490 --> 17:57.243
It's gotta be. I'm drained,

17:57.244 --> 17:58.745
and do you ever hear
about people making babies

17:58.746 --> 18:00.791
on top of Mount Everest? No, you don't.

18:00.792 --> 18:03.004
You think you're so smart
just because you're a pastor

18:03.005 --> 18:06.010
and I'm just an inner thigh
model for American Apparel.

18:06.011 --> 18:07.805
Oh, my God... Babe.

18:07.806 --> 18:10.979
Hello, why isn't
your suitcase in the trunk?

18:10.980 --> 18:12.731
I'm beginning to think
you don't have a husband.

18:12.732 --> 18:14.569
Just give me a second, okay?

18:16.907 --> 18:19.955
- Hey, Casey.
- Hey... whoa.

18:19.956 --> 18:21.416
That doesn't look good.

18:21.417 --> 18:23.003
Well, if my chic bob is uncool,

18:23.004 --> 18:25.215
then Katy Perry's haircut
is also uncool.

18:25.216 --> 18:27.761
No, no, she pulls it off
'cause she's got, like,

18:27.762 --> 18:29.724
big blue eyes and massive boobs

18:29.725 --> 18:31.644
to kind of help pull it all together.

18:31.645 --> 18:34.191
Okay, fine, listen,
I was eavesdropping on you two.

18:34.192 --> 18:37.156
- You're lying to your wife.
- I'm not lying to my wife.

18:37.157 --> 18:39.827
I know for a fact that you
can have sex at high altitudes.

18:39.828 --> 18:41.456
Remember, we did it
on the plane to Haiti.

18:41.457 --> 18:43.668
- We broke a toilet.
- No, you broke a toilet,

18:43.669 --> 18:45.422
- then we had sex.
- All right, let's just agree

18:45.423 --> 18:47.301
that the toilet was broken
before we got there.

18:47.302 --> 18:49.347
The point is, I work with women
every day who are trying

18:49.348 --> 18:51.142
to get pregnant.

18:51.143 --> 18:53.146
Do you know how devastating
it can be for a woman

18:53.147 --> 18:55.275
who wants to have a baby and can't?

18:55.276 --> 18:58.573
Yeah, yes, look, I don't know, I...

18:58.574 --> 19:00.452
It's just, we got married,
and I don't know if I'm ready

19:00.453 --> 19:01.955
to have kids yet.

19:01.956 --> 19:04.585
I'm only 38. It just feels like babies

19:04.586 --> 19:06.965
- making babies.
- Casey, you have lived

19:06.966 --> 19:09.637
more lives than any person
I have ever met, okay?

19:09.638 --> 19:12.142
You're a pastor, you're a DJ,
you're a shoe mogul.

19:12.143 --> 19:14.480
I had a cold-pressed
juice store in Boulder,

19:14.481 --> 19:17.111
but I got ran out of town by the weed.

19:17.112 --> 19:19.865
See? It's time for you to be a dad.

19:19.866 --> 19:21.244
You know, I forgot how much you know me.

19:21.245 --> 19:22.788
Hm.

19:25.211 --> 19:28.007
- Thanks, babe.
- Are you kidding me?

19:28.008 --> 19:30.512
I came back here because you
were supposed to run after me,

19:30.513 --> 19:32.307
but instead you're here talking to her?

19:32.308 --> 19:34.270
Babe, this isn't what
it looks like, Babe, okay?

19:34.271 --> 19:36.774
She means nothing to me.
She's basically like

19:36.775 --> 19:39.029
an older sister-type something.

19:39.030 --> 19:40.407
If you had sex with your older sister,

19:40.408 --> 19:42.286
like, a million times, but okay.

19:42.287 --> 19:44.248
Wait, wait, is this why
you're not having sex with me?

19:44.249 --> 19:46.377
Because you wanna rekindle
your thing with this old woman

19:46.378 --> 19:49.091
- and her terrible haircut?
- Okay, well, if my haircut

19:49.092 --> 19:51.721
is terrible, then I guess Katy... oh!

19:51.722 --> 19:53.558
I think it looks bad on both of you!

19:53.559 --> 19:55.812
I am the only one that can
pull off short hair.

19:55.813 --> 19:57.441
Oh, Babe, hey.

19:57.442 --> 20:00.071
This happens to me too much.

20:01.492 --> 20:05.123
Whoa, you look bad.

20:05.124 --> 20:06.834
Is it my hair or my face?

20:06.835 --> 20:08.296
Not helping each other.

20:08.297 --> 20:10.467
- Ugh.
- Here.

20:10.468 --> 20:12.638
- I got you a treat.
- What?

20:12.639 --> 20:14.642
Martha, where did you get these?

20:14.643 --> 20:16.312
I stole it from Brett. He keeps them

20:16.313 --> 20:18.149
in a shame locker.

20:18.150 --> 20:20.654
There's also an old "Maxim"
magazine with Megan Fox.

20:20.655 --> 20:23.409
- Do you want it?
- Oh, my God, I love her.

20:23.410 --> 20:26.123
"Megan Fox, Hollywood's funniest woman."

20:26.124 --> 20:28.419
Thank you... I can't believe you
stole these.

20:28.420 --> 20:30.257
I had to.

20:30.258 --> 20:32.511
By day two at two turtles,
my husband, Bill,

20:32.512 --> 20:34.598
used to sneak me a bag of candy because

20:34.599 --> 20:36.727
I just couldn't take it anymore.

20:36.728 --> 20:39.733
Wow. You have a husband.

20:39.734 --> 20:41.946
Huh, so he's at home
taking care of your,

20:41.947 --> 20:43.491
I wanna say, like, eight cats?

20:43.492 --> 20:48.084
No, actually, he died in February.

20:48.085 --> 20:49.963
You're right about the cats.

20:49.964 --> 20:52.593
Bill and I used to come here
every year for 15 years.

20:52.594 --> 20:54.973
Wow, February.

20:54.974 --> 20:57.102
Martha, that's so recent.

20:57.103 --> 20:59.148
Doesn't it make you sad
to come here without him?

20:59.149 --> 21:01.235
Look, I met you. I'd never met

21:01.236 --> 21:04.867
an Indian person before.
I think I like them.

21:04.868 --> 21:07.539
The thing I learned is that
anything or anybody

21:07.540 --> 21:10.128
can get taken from you at any time.

21:10.129 --> 21:12.257
The only vacation partner
you know will always

21:12.258 --> 21:15.722
be around is you, so you better like

21:15.723 --> 21:17.392
spending time with them.

21:17.393 --> 21:20.315
Martha, that was hella reassuring.

21:20.316 --> 21:22.152
Wait, you're not, like,
a spirit that haunts

21:22.153 --> 21:24.073
this resort and gives out
good advice, are you?

21:24.074 --> 21:26.285
No.

21:26.286 --> 21:27.287
Ow!

21:27.288 --> 21:28.915
Okay.

21:28.916 --> 21:30.710
I guess Reese Witherspoon was right.

21:30.711 --> 21:31.921
And so was Martha.

21:31.922 --> 21:33.091
I didn't need to meet a man

21:33.092 --> 21:34.760
to have a great vacation.

21:34.761 --> 21:37.516
I needed to meet myself,
and, as it turns out,

21:37.517 --> 21:39.061
I'm pretty cool.

21:39.062 --> 21:42.401
Hey, Mindy, thanks for all your help.

21:42.402 --> 21:44.029
Babe and I had sex.

21:44.030 --> 21:47.536
- Casey!
- Good to know.

21:47.537 --> 21:49.289
You used to be engaged to that guy?

21:49.290 --> 21:51.794
I was. He's actually a great guy.

21:51.795 --> 21:54.842
He just... he wasn't my Bill.

21:54.843 --> 21:57.974
Yeah, well, they can't all be.

21:57.975 --> 22:02.858
You know, I see you
with someone sharper, feistier.

22:02.859 --> 22:05.030
Someone who can keep up with you.

22:05.031 --> 22:07.701
Someone who can tell you
to shut up when you're being

22:07.702 --> 22:09.329
a bit much.

22:11.793 --> 22:13.921
I actually know someone like that,

22:13.922 --> 22:17.054
but that didn't work out either.

22:17.055 --> 22:20.101
Well, life is long.
