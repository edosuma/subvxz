WEBVTT

00:00.901 --> 00:04.895
Next up, secretary Schrute will read
the minutes from Sunday's meeting.

00:07.975 --> 00:10.809
"Minutes from previous meeting,
of Knights of the Night."

00:11.645 --> 00:12.669
No! Jim, hey.

00:12.746 --> 00:13.770
Oh.

00:13.847 --> 00:15.372
This meeting is for
Knights of the Night only.

00:15.449 --> 00:17.714
Knights of the Night are
volunteer crime patrollers.

00:17.784 --> 00:19.275
We're often compared
to the Guardian Angels,

00:19.353 --> 00:20.912
but we could not be more
different from them.

00:21.555 --> 00:24.855
Seriously, we are nothing
like the Guardian Angels.

00:24.925 --> 00:27.520
I mean,
broad strokes purposes, sure.

00:27.594 --> 00:28.823
Think Guardian Angels.

00:28.896 --> 00:30.660
One of our many
recent good deeds,

00:30.797 --> 00:32.595
we set out to capture
the Scranton Strangler.

00:33.567 --> 00:35.365
Mission accomplished.

00:35.435 --> 00:36.767
Not by us.

00:36.904 --> 00:39.339
I'm actually just looking for
my BlackBerry, so carry on.

00:39.406 --> 00:41.534
No, no, no, no, no.
I see how this movie ends.

00:41.608 --> 00:43.440
You make fun of me,
everyone laughs.

00:43.577 --> 00:44.704
Ha, ha, ha.

00:44.778 --> 00:45.768
Screw you.

00:46.046 --> 00:48.777
Dwight, don't be bothered
by your friend's presence.

00:49.583 --> 00:50.607
What are you gonna do now?

00:50.684 --> 00:52.744
You gonna make fun of our
leader's weird voice, huh?

00:52.819 --> 00:55.414
"Dwight, don't be bothered..."

00:55.722 --> 00:56.781
Over the line, Jim.

00:56.990 --> 00:59.391
I'm just looking for my phone,
so pretend I'm not here.

00:59.459 --> 01:02.725
Fine. "Minutes from previous
meeting of Knights of the Night."

01:03.463 --> 01:04.522
It's our official name, Jim.

01:04.665 --> 01:05.724
Sounds good.

01:05.799 --> 01:08.428
"Reflective strips
were glued to patrol jackets.

01:08.502 --> 01:11.199
"Knights went outside with
flashlights to test them."

01:11.271 --> 01:12.364
Smart.

01:12.439 --> 01:14.738
And the rest was just boiler
plate stuff, that's...

01:14.808 --> 01:16.174
Go ahead and read it,
some people weren't here.

01:16.243 --> 01:17.267
Okay.

01:17.344 --> 01:20.041
Knights stayed outside
to play flashlight tag.

01:20.113 --> 01:22.048
Oh, come on.
That sounds awesome.

01:22.416 --> 01:23.645
It was pretty cool.
Was it?

01:23.717 --> 01:24.844
It was fun.

01:24.985 --> 01:26.146
It was...
It was pretty awesome.

01:30.223 --> 01:32.749
Hey, yeah. No, I got it.

01:33.293 --> 01:34.625
Just leaving now.

01:56.883 --> 01:59.079
January 3, 2011.

01:59.386 --> 02:01.787
A day which will
live infamously.

02:02.556 --> 02:06.084
Holly Partridge Flax,
otherwise known as Holly,

02:06.159 --> 02:09.357
otherwise otherwise known
as a living, breathing angel,

02:09.429 --> 02:11.261
is engaged to another man.

02:11.932 --> 02:13.924
This is freaking me out. I...

02:15.202 --> 02:17.501
Okay, let's just switch
to the happy video, okay?

02:17.571 --> 02:19.870
No, no, no, no. Let's push through.
We'll do this.

02:19.940 --> 02:22.034
Today will either be the best
or the worst day of my life.

02:23.377 --> 02:24.902
Holly gave A.J. an ultimatum.

02:24.978 --> 02:27.470
He either proposes by New
Year's or they break up.

02:27.547 --> 02:29.539
Now if she's engaged,
I'm gonna go crazy.

02:29.683 --> 02:31.709
And I'm gonna
start attacking people.

02:31.785 --> 02:34.118
If she's not engaged,
in all honesty,

02:34.187 --> 02:35.246
I may just burn
this whole place

02:35.389 --> 02:36.482
to the ground
out of happiness.

02:36.556 --> 02:39.958
Either way, I am going to need
some talking down.

02:40.027 --> 02:43.486
And nobody talks me down like
myself in a video talking me down.

02:43.730 --> 02:45.323
Michael,
I know what you're thinking.

02:45.399 --> 02:47.698
Holly is engaged to somebody else
and you want to kill yourself.

02:47.768 --> 02:49.794
That may seem like
a good idea, but it's not.

02:51.071 --> 02:52.061
Snot.

02:52.906 --> 02:55.740
Sorry, it sounded like you said,
"It's snot." I'm so sorry.

02:56.109 --> 02:58.203
Okay, so killing yourself...

03:00.347 --> 03:01.838
I was just
thinking about snot.

03:05.752 --> 03:06.845
Good morning.

03:06.920 --> 03:08.786
Hey, guys. Uh, fun thing.

03:08.855 --> 03:11.484
The index cards on your desk
are resolution cards.

03:11.825 --> 03:13.487
You write your New Year's
resolution on them,

03:13.860 --> 03:17.228
I'll collect them, and then
display the cards on...

03:19.966 --> 03:21.901
This. Resolution board.

03:22.436 --> 03:24.132
Wow, did your baby draw that?

03:24.738 --> 03:26.366
The glitter is blinding.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.975
I think it's good.
It's gonna be fun.

03:29.409 --> 03:30.570
I recently met Sue,

03:31.011 --> 03:33.571
the office administrator
at Vance Refrigeration.

03:33.647 --> 03:36.310
She has this awesome wall
full of fun initiatives

03:36.383 --> 03:38.079
and morale boosters and stuff.

03:38.251 --> 03:41.085
Sue just goes for it.
She's awesome.

03:41.855 --> 03:44.290
I know Sue,
she's not that great.

03:44.458 --> 03:46.984
And you know her husband's
in a wheelchair, right?

03:47.160 --> 03:49.129
Okay, champagne.
Happy.

03:51.098 --> 03:52.191
Sponge.
Sad.

03:52.332 --> 03:53.425
To soak up my tears.

03:55.335 --> 03:57.133
Gummy bears and gummy worms.

03:57.437 --> 03:59.406
Bears sad, worms happy.
Come on, Erin.

04:01.108 --> 04:02.269
Ukuleles. Happy?

04:02.409 --> 04:03.604
Sad. Something to break.

04:06.046 --> 04:07.571
Chocolates.
For you, job well done.

04:08.048 --> 04:09.380
Thank you.

04:09.816 --> 04:11.148
And two bottles of scotch.

04:11.218 --> 04:12.277
Both sad.

04:13.153 --> 04:14.485
And did you get the tickets?

04:14.554 --> 04:16.579
I did, I did indeed.

04:16.656 --> 04:19.490
Two front row center to Paula
Poundstone, live in Poughkeepsie.

04:19.559 --> 04:20.788
Holly's favorite.

04:20.927 --> 04:22.691
I hope she doesn't call us up
on stage, that would suck.

04:23.530 --> 04:26.125
"Hey, you think you could do my
job better?" "I don't know."

04:26.199 --> 04:28.191
"What's your name?" "Michael."

04:29.703 --> 04:31.797
I'm really excited
for Michael either way.

04:31.872 --> 04:36.435
Because if Holly chooses to be
with him, he will be so, so happy.

04:36.643 --> 04:40.478
And if not, he'll be avoiding the
biggest mistake of his life.

04:41.481 --> 04:43.347
Oh, hey, guys.
I'd like to introduce you

04:43.483 --> 04:45.384
to a new little
friend of mine.

04:45.485 --> 04:47.613
His name is New
Year's Resolution Board.

04:47.854 --> 04:51.256
Shut up. Hello.

04:51.858 --> 04:53.349
What happened?
Is there a ring?

04:53.426 --> 04:55.418
So, high five me. We're back.

04:55.495 --> 04:56.588
To a happy...

04:57.364 --> 04:59.993
Woo! Look at those.
Mittens. Those a present?

05:00.066 --> 05:01.534
Come on.
They're warm.

05:01.601 --> 05:03.502
Those are so fuzzy and warm.

05:03.904 --> 05:05.395
Let me feel those.
Let me feel that.

05:05.806 --> 05:07.240
Put her there.
Give me a good firm one.

05:07.307 --> 05:08.331
Ooh, that's a good,
firm handshake.

05:08.475 --> 05:09.534
You're hired.

05:09.643 --> 05:12.238
Yes, well let's get right into
the Anderson account, shall we?

05:12.312 --> 05:14.042
Okay.
Yes, yes, right away.

05:14.114 --> 05:15.810
Yes, yes. Right away.

05:15.882 --> 05:16.941
Okay.

05:17.017 --> 05:19.486
Hey, hey, hey. Want me to
crank the thermostat to 90?

05:19.553 --> 05:21.488
Smoke her out? She can't keep
those mittens on forever.

05:21.555 --> 05:23.854
Yes. No, what? Stop. Yes.

05:27.994 --> 05:29.087
Congrat...

05:29.229 --> 05:30.356
Wow.
Oh.

05:30.430 --> 05:32.729
Oh, my God.
That's it, that's it.

05:34.167 --> 05:37.194
Oh, I get it. Everybody
knows about the ultimatum.

05:37.270 --> 05:38.602
Yes, I told everyone.

05:39.172 --> 05:40.936
Ha, ha!

05:41.007 --> 05:44.239
Hey, right back at you, bitch.

05:45.779 --> 05:48.044
Happy, happy, happy, happy!

05:53.053 --> 05:54.783
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

05:54.855 --> 05:57.484
Okay, calm down! Breathe.

05:57.557 --> 05:58.650
I'm trying.

05:58.725 --> 06:00.023
I said breathe.

06:00.093 --> 06:01.186
I'm trying.

06:01.261 --> 06:03.856
Wait a second.
Are you listening to music?

06:03.930 --> 06:04.954
What?

06:05.031 --> 06:06.431
Shut that off.

06:06.499 --> 06:08.229
I'm not
listening to the music.

06:08.301 --> 06:10.566
Fine, just go crazy
for a little while.

06:13.139 --> 06:15.074
Looking good.
You're looking good.

06:18.111 --> 06:19.977
I gotcha, I gotcha!

06:20.647 --> 06:22.115
I'm pulling you back!

06:23.583 --> 06:25.279
Michael dance-off!

06:26.553 --> 06:27.612
That's nice. That's nice.

06:27.687 --> 06:28.746
Go!

06:28.889 --> 06:29.948
Me, okay!

06:30.023 --> 06:31.582
Go!
Oh, yeah!

06:31.658 --> 06:33.286
Nice!
We're gonna calm down later.

06:33.760 --> 06:34.887
I'm doing it.
Oh, yeah!

06:34.961 --> 06:38.398
Oh, yeah!
Right there, right there!

06:38.465 --> 06:39.956
Oh, yeah!

06:43.403 --> 06:45.065
Hey, Dwight. I'm
collecting resolution cards.

06:45.138 --> 06:46.128
Not doing that.

06:46.206 --> 06:47.196
Why not?

06:47.340 --> 06:49.969
I've achieved plenty, and there's
no better than the best.

06:50.043 --> 06:51.136
Drink less caffeine.

06:51.211 --> 06:53.237
That's a good one, Pam.
Here's mine.

06:55.081 --> 06:56.344
"Learn to cook for one."

06:56.416 --> 06:58.078
Yeah, I love cooking.

06:58.151 --> 07:00.882
But I always find myself throwing
out half the food that I prepare.

07:00.954 --> 07:03.981
So I figured it's time to just start
preparing the right amount of food

07:04.057 --> 07:06.424
for the right number
of people, which is one.

07:06.626 --> 07:07.685
Well,
maybe you'll meet someone.

07:07.961 --> 07:09.930
No, some people just
don't meet someone.

07:09.996 --> 07:11.931
I'm fine with it. Really.

07:11.998 --> 07:13.466
This is not a pity party.

07:13.533 --> 07:15.502
It's not a party at all.
It's just sad.

07:16.970 --> 07:18.302
Angela.
Yes.

07:19.139 --> 07:20.869
"Make time for romance."

07:21.274 --> 07:23.209
Who's the senator?
My boyfriend.

07:23.944 --> 07:25.071
Oh, you mean
the state senator.

07:25.478 --> 07:28.471
I'm sorry, I was confused 'cause you
accidentally wrote "The senator."

07:29.149 --> 07:31.050
Wait, wait, wait.
It's that easy?

07:31.418 --> 07:33.819
That's not a resolution. That's
just something I wanna do.

07:33.887 --> 07:36.152
Okay, fine. I can do that.

07:41.394 --> 07:43.659
My resolution is
"Meet a loose woman."

07:43.730 --> 07:44.754
Oh, God.

07:45.932 --> 07:46.956
That's a good one.
Yeah?

07:47.033 --> 07:48.228
You know what?
That's my new one.

07:48.301 --> 07:49.428
I'm taking that one, too.

07:49.569 --> 07:50.730
Awesome.

07:50.804 --> 07:52.500
You know what
you guys should do?

07:52.572 --> 07:53.801
Go to the book store at lunch.

07:54.407 --> 07:56.706
There's tons of cuties
and it's easy to talk to them.

07:57.210 --> 07:58.769
"Hey, what book is that?"

07:58.845 --> 08:00.370
"Cool,
let's hang out tonight."

08:00.447 --> 08:01.779
"Sex already? Whoa."

08:02.415 --> 08:04.043
The book store?
It's that easy?

08:04.117 --> 08:05.380
I'll come with you,
show you how it's done.

08:05.452 --> 08:06.681
Okay.
I'll drive.

08:06.753 --> 08:08.722
My resolution is to read more.

08:08.788 --> 08:10.848
And if someone else is driving
me to the book store,

08:10.924 --> 08:13.519
I can eat my PB
and J in the car.

08:14.160 --> 08:17.096
2011 is coming up all Darryl.

08:18.598 --> 08:21.466
Hello.
Somebody's got a new phone.

08:21.534 --> 08:23.162
Yeah.
That is neat.

08:23.236 --> 08:25.865
I got it for Christmas.
I'm so out of my league here.

08:26.206 --> 08:28.334
E.T. phone Holly.

08:28.708 --> 08:30.074
Holly like phone?

08:30.310 --> 08:33.041
Holly misses old phone.

08:33.113 --> 08:34.172
Why?

08:34.246 --> 08:37.706
New phone is confusing,
gets bad reception.

08:37.851 --> 08:39.011
Oh, bummer.

08:39.152 --> 08:40.347
Bummer.

08:40.419 --> 08:41.649
Reese's pieces.

08:41.788 --> 08:43.017
Reese's pieces?

08:43.089 --> 08:44.455
Oh, God. Please stop.

08:45.425 --> 08:48.589
I still have my old phone.
This thing, indestructible.

08:53.733 --> 08:55.031
Oh, I should get this.

08:57.003 --> 08:58.062
Hey.

08:59.072 --> 09:01.837
No. Don't go see that one.
I want to see that together.

09:02.342 --> 09:04.038
Yeah, go see that action one.

09:04.978 --> 09:06.071
Okay.

09:06.679 --> 09:08.272
I love you, too.

09:10.517 --> 09:11.849
All right.

09:14.487 --> 09:16.649
Holly doesn't
seem to be engaged,

09:16.790 --> 09:18.986
but she's talking to A.J.
like she is.

09:19.059 --> 09:20.288
I can't figure it out.

09:20.794 --> 09:22.695
Do you think she's already
dating a different A.J.?

09:22.996 --> 09:24.089
I don't think so.

09:24.164 --> 09:26.724
When you broke it off with Roy did
you still tell him you loved him?

09:27.467 --> 09:29.060
No.
But you did still love him.

09:29.135 --> 09:30.626
I'm not gonna have...
Do you love him now?

09:30.703 --> 09:32.035
No!

09:32.505 --> 09:33.564
Just talk to her.

09:33.640 --> 09:35.040
No, she'd just resent me.

09:35.108 --> 09:37.373
Or worse, she would think
of me as her friend.

09:37.444 --> 09:39.174
"Oh, hi, friend."

09:39.479 --> 09:40.811
I'll talk to her, Michael.

09:40.880 --> 09:42.075
You think she'd talk to you?

09:42.148 --> 09:43.207
Why wouldn't she?

09:43.283 --> 09:45.514
That's true, she's really nice.
She'd talk to anybody.

09:47.187 --> 09:48.849
Why don't you bring
Erin to balance you out?

09:49.823 --> 09:50.950
There's a plan.

09:52.392 --> 09:54.258
All right, we should
divide up by section.

09:54.394 --> 09:56.295
I will take
Romance and Travel.

09:56.362 --> 09:58.126
I'll take the entirety
of the second floor.

09:58.264 --> 10:00.130
I got that cutie
behind the counter.

10:06.339 --> 10:09.002
Well, if you read a lot you
should check out our e-readers.

10:09.075 --> 10:10.566
They're really neat.

10:10.710 --> 10:12.201
Oh, I work at a paper company.

10:12.312 --> 10:13.974
Those things terrify me.

10:14.047 --> 10:15.879
They could put us out
of business, you know?

10:15.949 --> 10:17.577
Heard those machines
hold, like, 10 books at once.

10:17.817 --> 10:19.217
Actually, it's 10,000.

10:19.452 --> 10:20.886
Holy . What?

10:21.121 --> 10:22.555
Let me see that.

10:22.922 --> 10:25.448
So light. Like a croissant.

10:25.992 --> 10:27.187
Hi.
Hi.

10:27.694 --> 10:28.889
Welcome.

10:29.395 --> 10:30.522
Let us know if
you need anything.

10:31.131 --> 10:32.292
Thanks.

10:33.933 --> 10:35.492
Why did we pretend
like we work here?

10:35.835 --> 10:36.928
Is that what we were doing?

10:37.070 --> 10:38.197
I don't know...

10:38.505 --> 10:39.495
Hey, how'd you do?

10:39.572 --> 10:41.598
Good. Yeah.
Good, real good. Yeah.

10:41.674 --> 10:43.267
I think we kind of nailed it.
Yeah, pretty much.

10:43.343 --> 10:45.744
But, you know, this place is kind
of tapped out, so let's roll.

10:46.179 --> 10:47.477
Cool.
Okay.

10:47.547 --> 10:48.742
What'd you get?

10:48.882 --> 10:50.077
A book about oceans.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.345
Oh, really?
What else? Let me see.

10:51.417 --> 10:53.010
That's porn.

10:53.653 --> 10:56.088
Pornography.
Old lady. Nasty porn.

10:59.659 --> 11:01.184
Follow my lead.

11:01.261 --> 11:02.354
Hey, want some company?

11:02.495 --> 11:03.588
Want some company?

11:03.796 --> 11:05.128
Oh, sure. Have a seat.

11:07.100 --> 11:08.227
How were your breaks?

11:08.301 --> 11:09.769
Oh, really good.
I went to Portugal.

11:09.836 --> 11:10.860
I went to Portugal.

11:10.970 --> 11:12.836
Oh, wow. You went together?

11:13.439 --> 11:14.532
No.
No.

11:15.275 --> 11:17.801
So, I just gotta know. What's
going on with you and A.J.?

11:18.077 --> 11:19.101
Nothing really happened.

11:19.445 --> 11:21.073
I mean,
I know I made a big deal

11:21.214 --> 11:22.842
about this whole
New Year's deadline,

11:22.916 --> 11:25.215
but, it came and went
and we're still together.

11:25.518 --> 11:26.679
You didn't break up
with A.J. at all?

11:26.753 --> 11:29.018
I mean, not even for a week
to make him buy you a present?

11:29.088 --> 11:32.217
It just wasn't fair of me to give him
an ultimatum in the first place.

11:32.292 --> 11:34.318
The whole thing is
totally my fault.

11:34.394 --> 11:37.057
But we're gonna be just fine.
Just fine.

11:37.130 --> 11:38.154
Hmm.

11:44.537 --> 11:46.005
Whoa!
Hold on.

11:46.072 --> 11:48.234
I am not going back
until I fulfill my resolution.

11:48.308 --> 11:50.038
Oh, no, no, no. Uh-uh.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.269
Come on, why not?

11:52.912 --> 11:53.971
I've never been in one before.

11:54.047 --> 11:56.448
I'm tired of being Mr. Perfect
Role Model all the time.

11:56.883 --> 11:58.010
I'm telling you, don't do it.

11:58.651 --> 12:00.176
I got nothing
against strip clubs,

12:00.253 --> 12:03.246
but I do have something against
them at noon on a Monday.

12:03.489 --> 12:05.458
The day shift at a strip club?

12:06.059 --> 12:07.425
You can't un-see that.

12:07.660 --> 12:09.891
Well, we can't just go back. I
mean, we came out to meet women.

12:10.196 --> 12:12.256
Hey, there's a roller
rink across the street.

12:12.498 --> 12:13.557
There's always
chicks at the rink.

12:14.701 --> 12:15.862
What kind of chicks
are you gonna meet there?

12:15.935 --> 12:18.131
I don't know. Single
moms at a skating party?

12:19.038 --> 12:21.405
Sweet 16, 10-year
reunion parties.

12:21.474 --> 12:23.443
Chicks fall down,
need help getting back up.

12:23.509 --> 12:25.444
Roller derby practice.

12:27.413 --> 12:28.437
We're going skating.

12:40.193 --> 12:41.456
The goal of this
meeting is to get

12:41.527 --> 12:43.359
everybody excited
about their resolutions.

12:44.597 --> 12:46.589
Who's been good
about their resolution so far?

12:48.101 --> 12:49.330
Erin, tell us about it.

12:49.402 --> 12:52.668
Well, my goal was to learn a
new word every single day.

12:52.805 --> 12:55.900
And I must say that
it is going immensely.

12:56.209 --> 12:57.404
Cool.

12:57.477 --> 13:01.175
Here's a little "way
to go" gift from Sabre.

13:01.848 --> 13:03.146
Intercepted.
Hey... Gabe.

13:03.216 --> 13:04.240
Oops-e-doops.

13:04.317 --> 13:07.014
Creed, I notice you don't have
a resolution on the board.

13:07.086 --> 13:08.247
What's yours?

13:08.321 --> 13:09.584
I want to do a cartwheel.

13:09.656 --> 13:10.919
But real casual, like.

13:10.990 --> 13:12.856
Not make a big deal out of it.

13:12.925 --> 13:16.657
But I know everybody saw it, just
one stunning, gorgeous cartwheel.

13:16.729 --> 13:17.822
How's it going?

13:17.897 --> 13:19.866
I'm having a little
trouble motivating.

13:19.932 --> 13:23.369
One of the hardest parts about
making resolutions is keeping them.

13:23.736 --> 13:26.763
In fact, most resolutions
are abandoned by February.

13:26.973 --> 13:28.566
Or sooner.
Yeah.

13:28.641 --> 13:30.507
It's not a joke.
But that's okay.

13:30.610 --> 13:33.045
Because it's not about being
perfect, it's about trying.

13:33.513 --> 13:36.244
In fact, why don't we go around
and confess some of the ways

13:36.316 --> 13:37.978
that we've already fudged
on our resolutions?

13:38.151 --> 13:42.384
Well, I said that I would eat more
vegetables, and I haven't yet.

13:42.455 --> 13:44.583
But it's okay.
I still have time.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.523
Since last year I ate none.

13:46.693 --> 13:50.528
Okay, well, my confession is that
today I had a sip of coffee.

13:50.630 --> 13:51.996
But that's fine.
Is it?

13:52.065 --> 13:54.899
Yes, because with
all of your support,

13:54.967 --> 13:58.870
by this time next year maybe I'll be
down to one glass of iced tea a week.

13:58.938 --> 14:01.430
Next year? Come on.
I mean, what is the point?

14:01.507 --> 14:02.770
What is the point of that?

14:02.942 --> 14:05.537
I made a resolution to floss.
And I did it.

14:05.878 --> 14:07.346
12:01, January 1st.

14:07.647 --> 14:08.910
Bam! Blood everywhere.

14:09.248 --> 14:11.240
Not all of us are
Michael "Freaking" Scott.

14:11.317 --> 14:13.912
What is wrong with you people?
Can't you stick to anything?

14:14.587 --> 14:17.421
Erin, I want you to go to the
kitchen and get me some vegetables.

14:17.990 --> 14:20.585
Creed, you say you want to do a cartwheel?
Nothing's stopping you.

14:20.827 --> 14:22.523
Come on, old man.
Do a cartwheel!

14:22.595 --> 14:23.927
Well, I can't.
I don't know how.

14:23.996 --> 14:26.465
You're just going to somersault
around for the rest of your life.

14:26.532 --> 14:29.058
And you know what's gonna be
on your tombstone? "Loser."

14:29.402 --> 14:30.870
My tombstone's
already made, thank you.

14:30.937 --> 14:32.098
Just do a cartwheel!

14:32.238 --> 14:33.433
This is all I could find.

14:35.608 --> 14:36.632
Eat it.

14:37.110 --> 14:38.738
You don't have
to do that, Kevin.

14:38.811 --> 14:40.677
Oh, no.
I'm glad this is happening.

14:41.347 --> 14:42.906
Thank you, Michael.

14:43.216 --> 14:44.582
Why are you eating stem first?

14:44.717 --> 14:47.312
This is a new food for me.
How else should I eat it?

14:48.054 --> 14:49.386
The other way.

14:51.290 --> 14:53.953
Can I get some Cheez Whiz?
Or Hollandaise?

14:54.026 --> 14:55.654
No, no. No Cheez Whiz,
no Hollandaise,

14:55.795 --> 14:57.388
no chocolate sauce,
just eat it.

14:57.463 --> 14:59.159
Come on, here comes the airplane.
There you go.

14:59.232 --> 15:01.394
Open, open, into the hangar,
there you go.

15:01.467 --> 15:03.129
Oh, Michael.
Yeah, eat it.

15:03.870 --> 15:04.997
Put it in your mouth,
and just eat it.

15:05.138 --> 15:06.265
God, I hate it.

15:06.339 --> 15:07.967
I don't care whether you hate
it, you said you'd do it!

15:08.040 --> 15:09.030
Michael, Michael.
All right.

15:09.108 --> 15:11.077
Eat it, eat it!
Oh, my God.

15:11.144 --> 15:12.305
You're killing him, Michael.

15:12.578 --> 15:14.547
All right, all right, all right!
Shh! Michael!

15:15.248 --> 15:17.877
Okay, I ate the fluffy part.
Can I be done?

15:18.217 --> 15:20.015
Let me see if you swallowed it.
Open your mouth.

15:21.287 --> 15:23.483
Under your tongue. Oh, God!

15:24.557 --> 15:26.651
You guys are pathetic.

15:31.497 --> 15:32.760
Can I get some
candy or something?

15:32.832 --> 15:34.801
No, you can't have any candy!
I'll get him water.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.425
Okay, Michael.
Just settle down.

15:37.270 --> 15:38.363
Um...

15:41.974 --> 15:43.067
Oh, God!

15:46.546 --> 15:48.481
Holly Flax.

15:48.548 --> 15:49.880
Yes, Michael?

15:49.949 --> 15:52.248
Not Michael, E.T.

15:52.351 --> 15:53.683
What's up?

15:55.221 --> 15:57.486
Well, I just want to talk
about what happened in there.

15:57.957 --> 16:00.256
Oh, no, Michael. I don't want
to talk about it with you.

16:00.326 --> 16:02.955
And I'm fine, I just...
I don't want to talk about it.

16:03.029 --> 16:04.122
Okay.

16:34.460 --> 16:36.019
Holly, come on in.
Thanks for coming.

16:36.095 --> 16:39.395
I thought there should be
an HR rep here for this.

16:40.900 --> 16:42.926
So Kevin and Creed,

16:43.002 --> 16:44.834
things got a little bit intense
in the conference room.

16:44.904 --> 16:46.031
You think?

16:46.172 --> 16:47.333
And I wanted to apologize.

16:47.406 --> 16:49.602
These resolutions
should be about you,

16:49.675 --> 16:51.769
and I made it about me.

16:51.844 --> 16:53.039
And it was none of my beeswax.

16:53.112 --> 16:54.239
You were super mean.

16:54.514 --> 16:56.210
It was insensitive
and I am sorry.

16:56.549 --> 16:58.745
It was traumatizing, Michael.

16:58.818 --> 17:01.982
I wouldn't be surprised if I
never ate a vegetable again.

17:02.321 --> 17:06.588
I really wanted you to follow
through on your resolutions.

17:06.893 --> 17:08.521
The cartwheel, the veggies.

17:08.794 --> 17:12.390
I...
I care about you. Very much.

17:13.366 --> 17:16.233
And you loom so
large in my heart

17:16.702 --> 17:18.671
that I crossed the line.

17:19.672 --> 17:21.698
Okay, Michael, no offense.

17:22.074 --> 17:24.134
But you need to
get your own life.

17:24.410 --> 17:25.877
You're right.

17:26.378 --> 17:30.214
And I hope that we
can still be friends.

17:30.750 --> 17:33.185
I don't think I'm
there yet, boss.

17:33.986 --> 17:35.614
Well, I am.
Okay.

17:37.056 --> 17:38.115
All right.

17:38.190 --> 17:39.488
I'm gonna help you.

17:39.625 --> 17:40.957
Okay, okay.

17:44.463 --> 17:47.695
Hey, it's just you.
Anything you want to hear?

17:48.834 --> 17:49.927
Um...

17:50.670 --> 17:52.571
Dave Matthews Band.

17:52.638 --> 17:54.197
No hits, deep tracks only.

17:54.607 --> 17:55.700
Okay.

17:55.942 --> 17:58.411
I said, no hits.

18:10.723 --> 18:13.989
I just feel blocked.
I feel like I'm living...

18:14.060 --> 18:15.426
Hey, Ryan.
Yeah.

18:15.494 --> 18:17.554
How's your fart
project coming?

18:17.630 --> 18:19.064
That's real,
real classy, Kevin.

18:19.131 --> 18:20.497
Hey, was it me or
you that just shoved

18:20.633 --> 18:22.033
the butt end of
a pound of broccoli

18:22.101 --> 18:24.093
into my mouth
because Michael told me to?

18:24.203 --> 18:25.262
Me.

18:25.404 --> 18:26.463
Kevin, don't.

18:28.107 --> 18:29.473
Come on.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.009
Oh, Pam? Soda. Caffeine.

18:31.777 --> 18:34.337
Yeah, just a little. I have
a lot to deal with today.

18:34.413 --> 18:36.279
Well, if you don't
have to do them...

18:36.949 --> 18:38.679
Meredith, what are you doing?
I could be pregnant.

18:38.751 --> 18:39.878
Okay, no.

18:40.152 --> 18:42.553
Oh, my resolution was to
get more attention.

18:42.622 --> 18:43.851
Nope, she's lying.

18:43.923 --> 18:45.619
Hey, Ryan.

18:49.061 --> 18:51.030
One, two, three.

18:52.832 --> 18:54.130
I did it. I did a cartwheel.

18:54.266 --> 18:55.700
You!

18:55.768 --> 18:56.792
Oh, God!

18:56.869 --> 18:57.859
Okay, that's it.

18:57.937 --> 18:58.927
God!

19:06.278 --> 19:07.803
Lesson learned.

19:11.050 --> 19:12.450
What's up?

19:12.585 --> 19:14.019
Hey, where'd you go?

19:14.253 --> 19:16.222
To the arcade.
Oh, cool.

19:16.922 --> 19:18.220
Why, did you meet someone?

19:18.290 --> 19:19.690
Yeah. I did, actually.

19:20.559 --> 19:21.857
His name is Andy.

19:21.927 --> 19:24.362
And he roller skates like a Greek God.
And you know what?

19:24.430 --> 19:26.524
I kind of like
hanging out with him.

19:26.599 --> 19:28.192
Right on, son.

19:29.368 --> 19:30.836
Gentlemen.

19:30.903 --> 19:32.804
And where did you go?

19:32.872 --> 19:33.999
Strip club.

19:34.073 --> 19:36.565
I was looking at the strippers
at the strip club.

19:36.909 --> 19:38.844
Right.
So that's it, guys?

19:39.011 --> 19:40.877
If you want I can
put on the strobe.

19:45.518 --> 19:46.986
Yeah!

20:01.367 --> 20:02.426
Do you want to keep this?

20:02.568 --> 20:03.627
No.

20:04.870 --> 20:05.929
Do you want to keep this?

20:06.072 --> 20:07.165
Yeah.

20:09.375 --> 20:10.570
Do you wanna keep this?

20:10.710 --> 20:11.905
No, you can toss them.

20:14.547 --> 20:17.881
My resolution? I never want
to make Holly cry again.

20:18.751 --> 20:21.243
Unless it's from
laughing too hard.

20:22.054 --> 20:24.353
Or making love
too beautifully.

20:28.561 --> 20:30.496
We're gonna be just fine.

20:33.165 --> 20:34.895
You know how you say
something over and over

20:34.967 --> 20:37.459
and the words
start to sound weird?

20:37.703 --> 20:39.433
Going to be just fine.

20:39.505 --> 20:42.771
Just fine, just fine, just fine.

20:44.443 --> 20:47.436
I just think we need to cool
things down for a while.

20:48.781 --> 20:50.477
Yeah, a break.

20:51.150 --> 20:53.346
At least until I
get back to Nashua.

20:54.420 --> 20:55.945
Yeah, I'm sure.

20:58.691 --> 21:01.820
Look at where you're going
to be doing the cartwheel.

21:01.894 --> 21:03.453
So look where you're going
to be placing your hand.

21:03.529 --> 21:05.054
So pick a spot.
Mmm-hmm.

21:05.498 --> 21:06.864
You ready to do this?
Yes, sir.

21:06.932 --> 21:08.992
You know what? I'm gonna stay
here as long as it takes.

21:09.068 --> 21:10.627
I really appreciate it.
I'm gonna spot you.

21:10.703 --> 21:12.001
Spot you.

21:12.772 --> 21:13.831
Go.

21:15.508 --> 21:16.737
I did it!

21:17.510 --> 21:18.500
You did?

21:18.577 --> 21:19.567
A perfect cartwheel.

21:20.713 --> 21:21.806
Okay, good!

21:22.214 --> 21:24.376
What a rush! That's
all I had to do all year.

21:24.450 --> 21:26.078
Congratulations.

21:26.485 --> 21:29.421
All right. Well, all
right, see you tomorrow.
