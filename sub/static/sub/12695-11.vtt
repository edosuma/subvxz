WEBVTT

00:07.433 --> 00:09.033
- Hey, Max, we just got
invited--

00:09.133 --> 00:11.200
- To Winnie Lee's party.
I know.

00:11.300 --> 00:14.800
- Oh, and hey--
- My band's playing. I know.

00:14.900 --> 00:16.700
- Oh, but wait--
- Her parents won't be there.

00:16.800 --> 00:18.167
I know.

00:18.267 --> 00:21.133
- Will you please stop
knowing things.

00:21.233 --> 00:23.267
- It's annoying.
I know.

00:25.167 --> 00:27.967
- This stinks--
Mom and Dad will never

00:28.067 --> 00:29.200
let us go to a party
without parents.

00:29.300 --> 00:31.967
- Phoebe, once again,
I'm way ahead of you.

00:32.067 --> 00:34.067
Follow my lead.

00:34.167 --> 00:36.733
Mom, Dad, Phoebe and I
got invited

00:36.833 --> 00:39.267
to Winnie Lee's party tonight,
and before you ask,

00:39.367 --> 00:41.100
yes, her parents
will be there.

00:41.200 --> 00:44.433
- Yep, a couple of parents,
there all night,

00:44.533 --> 00:46.100
bein' parents.
[laughs]

00:46.200 --> 00:49.700
- In fact, why don't you
give 'em a call?

00:49.800 --> 00:51.833
- Yep, we're callin'
her parents.

00:51.933 --> 00:54.900
For some reason,
we're calling her parents.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
- [cell phone ringing]

00:56.100 --> 00:59.300
- VOICE ON PHONE:
Hello, Mr. Lee here.

00:59.400 --> 01:01.500
- Hi, this is Hank
and Barb Thunderman.

01:01.600 --> 01:04.267
We understand Winnie's
throwing a party tonight?

01:04.367 --> 01:06.267
- Yeah, will you be
there to supervise?

01:06.367 --> 01:07.733
- Of course, I will.

01:07.833 --> 01:10.067
Because that's what
real dads do.

01:12.333 --> 01:15.633
I'll be watching those
children like a hawk.

01:15.733 --> 01:19.200
Caw! Caw!

01:19.300 --> 01:22.300
Caw....call ya later.

01:22.400 --> 01:24.800
Hello, gang, what's up?

01:24.900 --> 01:29.133
- What, Colosso,
you're Winnie's dad?

01:29.233 --> 01:32.767
- Walk away, Max,
just walk away.

01:34.067 --> 01:36.067
- *

01:36.133 --> 01:37.467
* What you see

01:37.567 --> 01:38.567
* Is not what you get

01:38.667 --> 01:42.133
* Livin' our lives
with a secret *

01:42.233 --> 01:43.600
* We fit right in

01:43.700 --> 01:45.367
* Bet you'd never guessed

01:45.467 --> 01:46.267
* 'Cause we're
livin' our lives *

01:46.367 --> 01:48.700
* Just like all the rest

01:48.800 --> 01:50.400
* A picture
perfect family *

01:50.500 --> 01:52.233
* Is what we try to be

01:52.333 --> 01:53.633
* Look closer,
you might see *

01:53.733 --> 01:55.633
* The crazy things we do

01:55.733 --> 01:57.067
* This isn't
make believe *

01:57.133 --> 01:58.667
* It's our reality

01:58.767 --> 02:00.067
* Just your average family

02:00.100 --> 02:03.600
* Trying to be normal
and stay out of trouble *

02:03.700 --> 02:06.633
* Livin' a double life

02:12.867 --> 02:14.700
We shouldn't be going to a party
without adult supervision.

02:14.800 --> 02:16.300
- Yes, so instead, we're gonna
spend the whole evening

02:16.400 --> 02:20.600
studying at the library.
- HANK: Hold it!

02:20.700 --> 02:23.667
- [velcro ripping]
- MAX: Oh.

02:25.667 --> 02:27.533
- Max, were you gonna ditch
me to go to the party?

02:27.633 --> 02:28.633
Can you--

02:34.700 --> 02:35.167
- Would you believe

02:35.167 --> 02:36.533
this is "library casual"?

02:37.267 --> 02:41.633
- Yeah, now it's
"busted casual."

02:41.733 --> 02:43.300
- Come on, Mom, Oyster and I
are the party band.

02:43.400 --> 02:45.900
You could be killing
our careers here.

02:46.067 --> 02:48.067
- Yeah, and Winnie Lee is
the most popular girl in school.

02:48.133 --> 02:50.433
If you turn down one of her
parties, you're done.

02:50.533 --> 02:52.733
Kelly Franklin did that once and
you know what happened to her?

02:52.833 --> 02:56.700
- No.
- Exactly, 'cause she's done!

02:56.800 --> 02:58.733
- Sorry, our decision
is final.

02:58.833 --> 03:00.500
- What do you guys
have against parties?

03:00.600 --> 03:03.533
- Oh, we love parties,
if they have parents.

03:03.633 --> 03:07.700
- In fact, your Mom and I
met at a party.

03:07.800 --> 03:09.600
- PHOEBE & MAX: We know.

03:09.700 --> 03:11.400
- I got cold.
- I gave you my jacket.

03:11.500 --> 03:15.500
- PHOEBE & MAX: And then
we kissed. Ew!

03:15.600 --> 03:17.167
- It wasn't "Ew!"
It was electric.

03:17.267 --> 03:18.800
Sparks actually flew.

03:18.900 --> 03:22.467
- It was the moment your mother
found out she had superpowers,

03:22.567 --> 03:25.167
so, if you think about it,
she's only super because of me.

03:25.267 --> 03:27.500
- [powers zapping]
- Ah!

03:27.600 --> 03:29.800
I'm nothing without you.

03:29.900 --> 03:32.833
- I'm nothing without
that party.

03:32.933 --> 03:34.133
- Well, looks like it's
off to the library.

03:34.233 --> 03:37.667
- Max.
- Hank.

03:39.733 --> 03:42.700
I know. Walk away.

03:42.800 --> 03:45.133
- How did you know they were
wearing breakaway clothes?

03:45.233 --> 03:49.167
- I didn't. That could
have gone really bad.

03:49.267 --> 03:51.800
- [helicopter blades whirring]
- There's cousin Blobbin...

03:51.900 --> 03:53.533
unless we know someone
else very rich

03:53.633 --> 03:56.200
with a solid
gold helicopter.

03:56.300 --> 03:59.067
- Bye! We're living with
cousin Blobbin now.

03:59.167 --> 04:00.967
- No, you're just going
to Metroburg for the night

04:01.067 --> 04:04.433
to meet his new dog.
- Yeah, hugs before you go.

04:04.533 --> 04:06.467
- Blobbin!
- Hello, Thundermans!

04:06.567 --> 04:08.567
- And now he's gonna
do his...

04:08.667 --> 04:12.300
- Hiya! Hiya! Hiya!
[laughing]

04:12.400 --> 04:14.567
- Kids, you be good.
You mind your cousin, Blobbin.

04:14.667 --> 04:16.667
- Oh, don't worry.
I'll take care of them.

04:16.767 --> 04:19.500
Hey, who wants to fly
my helicopter, first?

04:19.600 --> 04:20.533
- I do!
- I do!

04:20.633 --> 04:22.567
- [laughing]
You can take turns.

04:22.667 --> 04:25.233
We'll just switch in mid-air.
[laughing]

04:29.300 --> 04:31.767
- Ah!

04:31.867 --> 04:33.800
Why are you down
here, Phoebe?

04:33.900 --> 04:36.067
And why are you holding
my BrainMelt 3000?

04:36.133 --> 04:37.700
- No reason.

04:37.800 --> 04:40.167
I mean, it's not
like you could tweak it

04:40.267 --> 04:41.967
to make Mom and Dad remember
what it's like to be teenagers,

04:42.067 --> 04:43.700
so we could go to
that party.

04:43.800 --> 04:45.867
- Come on, Phoebe,
that'll never--

04:45.967 --> 04:48.567
Wait! I can do that.

04:48.667 --> 04:50.700
If I wipe their
adult memories,

04:50.800 --> 04:51.400
they'll think
they're our age.

04:51.500 --> 04:54.800
- What? Really?

04:54.900 --> 04:56.500
Max, I can't believe
you had that idea

04:56.600 --> 05:00.300
and are solely responsible
for said idea.

05:00.400 --> 05:02.733
- This little game we're
playing making you feel better?

05:02.833 --> 05:04.733
- Yes. I can't be
part of this.

05:04.833 --> 05:06.933
Now here are your tools.

05:10.367 --> 05:11.933
- Your house is huge,
cousin Blobbin.

05:12.067 --> 05:14.867
- I know. I find new
rooms every day.

05:14.967 --> 05:18.067
Thank goodness
we have this map. [laughing]

05:18.100 --> 05:20.900
Oh, look, I have a food court!
[laughing]

05:21.067 --> 05:23.067
- We cannot wait
to meet your puppy.

05:23.167 --> 05:27.133
- Yeah, he's the best.
His name--Doggin.

05:27.233 --> 05:30.733
He does tricks and he's always
there when you need him.

05:30.833 --> 05:31.400
- Really? Where is he?

05:31.500 --> 05:33.500
- He's not here.

05:33.600 --> 05:35.633
Before I can
officially adopt him,

05:35.733 --> 05:37.333
the dog people need
to know that

05:37.433 --> 05:39.433
he's getting a new home
with a happy family.

05:39.533 --> 05:41.133
- But you don't have
a family.

05:41.233 --> 05:43.767
- I do, if you two
pretend to be my kids.

05:43.867 --> 05:48.667
What do you say, Blobby Junior
and Blobby-Sue?

05:48.767 --> 05:50.433
- Wait, you brought us all
the way to Metroburg

05:50.533 --> 05:52.233
just so you could
get a dog?

05:52.333 --> 05:53.833
Not cool.
- Yeah, we're not your puppets.

05:53.933 --> 05:54.900
- I'll buy you
whatever you want.

05:55.067 --> 05:57.367
- Let's get this
puppet show started!

05:57.467 --> 05:59.367
- [laughing]
- Oh, yeah!

06:03.067 --> 06:04.800
- Were we too hard
on the kids?

06:04.900 --> 06:07.800
- Never. Their job
is to listen and obey.

06:07.900 --> 06:09.800
Deep down they know
who's boss around here.

06:09.900 --> 06:10.833
- Now they do.

06:14.067 --> 06:15.833
- Please let me melt
their brains.

06:15.933 --> 06:17.333
- Melt away.

06:24.100 --> 06:26.967
- [electricity zapping]

06:31.067 --> 06:34.133
- Oh, my gosh!
Like what just happened?

06:36.300 --> 06:40.400
- Dude, I'm freaking out!
Where am I?

06:40.500 --> 06:42.867
- It worked!

06:42.967 --> 06:45.933
- You're in Hiddenville now,
but just for the night.

06:46.067 --> 06:49.433
- Road trip. Nice!

06:49.533 --> 06:51.300
- Uh, yeah, you guys have
this whole house to yourself.

06:51.400 --> 06:53.967
And get this--no parents.

06:54.067 --> 06:55.800
- Oh, totally rad!

06:55.900 --> 06:56.833
- Fridge raid!

07:00.600 --> 07:02.067
- This is reversible, right?

07:02.100 --> 07:03.400
- [scoffs] Now you're
asking me that?

07:03.500 --> 07:06.900
Relax.
Of course, it is.

07:07.067 --> 07:10.400
- Oh, cute hair.
I love this braid thing.

07:10.500 --> 07:14.500
I'm Barbie.
- I'm Max and this is--

07:14.600 --> 07:16.200
- Weird!

07:16.300 --> 07:20.067
- Whoa, you guys have
a butt load of ice cream

07:20.100 --> 07:22.900
and I'm one hungry
Hankosaurus Rex.

07:23.067 --> 07:24.900
[screeching]

07:25.067 --> 07:28.933
- Oh, that Hankosaur guy
is such a loudmouth.

07:29.067 --> 07:31.100
I mean, why is he
even here?

07:31.200 --> 07:33.500
- I thought he was
your boyfriend.

07:33.600 --> 07:36.067
- Oh! As if!

07:36.133 --> 07:38.533
- Anyway, Phoebe
and I gotta go.

07:38.633 --> 07:39.767
I'm playing
a party tonight.

07:39.867 --> 07:41.867
- I'll bring the ice cream.

07:41.967 --> 07:44.067
- Actually,
it's invite only.

07:44.100 --> 07:49.233
- Harsh.
- See ya.

07:49.333 --> 07:51.567
- [imitates airplane
zooming]

07:51.667 --> 07:54.133
- I'm gonna need some sunglasses
for all this bling.

07:56.900 --> 07:59.167
Much better.

07:59.267 --> 08:01.967
- You asked for it
and I got it.

08:02.067 --> 08:04.167
Well, I paid someone
to get it.

08:04.267 --> 08:08.067
From the Metroburg
supermarket.

08:08.133 --> 08:09.500
- BOTH: Spazzberries!

08:09.600 --> 08:10.767
- Uh! Uh! Uh! Uh!

08:10.867 --> 08:13.467
These'll make you
really, really hyper.

08:13.567 --> 08:17.067
You'll get them after
you get me my dog.

08:17.133 --> 08:19.800
- [doorbell rings]
- That must be the dog lady.

08:19.900 --> 08:22.333
Remember, I'm your dad.
- Got it.

08:22.433 --> 08:23.567
And I'm Blobby-Sue.
- [smacks arm]

08:23.667 --> 08:28.500
- I mean, Blobby Junior.

08:28.600 --> 08:30.067
- Oh, hello, Mrs. Rubin.

08:30.100 --> 08:33.333
Welcome to my wonder--
- Let's cut to the chase.

08:33.433 --> 08:36.200
Sit!
- [gasps]

08:36.300 --> 08:38.967
- I'm not a big fan
of you superheroes.

08:39.067 --> 08:40.067
You're always dressing
up my doggies

08:40.167 --> 08:43.400
and putting them in danger.
- What?

08:43.500 --> 08:45.133
No. No.
[laughing]

08:45.233 --> 08:47.900
I would never do that.
Never. Would I, boy?

08:48.067 --> 08:49.167
No, I wouldn't,
Doggin, no, I--

08:49.267 --> 08:50.467
- [spraying water]
Heel, boy, heel, boy, heel!

08:50.567 --> 08:52.933
- [coughing, sputtering]

08:53.067 --> 08:54.767
- His name is Spot.

08:54.867 --> 08:55.700
And he's not yours
until I'm certain

08:55.800 --> 08:58.467
that this is
a happy home.

08:58.567 --> 09:01.567
- Oh, yes, of course.

09:01.667 --> 09:03.900
Let me introduce you
to my little angels--

09:04.067 --> 09:08.300
[gasps]
- BOTH: [hyperactive giggling]

09:08.400 --> 09:11.300
- Oh...Oh...

09:11.400 --> 09:14.100
I thought we said we'd save
them for later.

09:14.200 --> 09:17.467
- I couldn't wait!
They were so purple and juicy!

09:17.567 --> 09:20.300
- Spazzberry!

09:21.500 --> 09:24.200
- [groaning]

09:25.333 --> 09:26.700
- We're almost at
Winnie Lee's house.

09:26.800 --> 09:27.600
This is gonna be
so awesome.

09:27.700 --> 09:29.733
- Party, here we come.

09:29.833 --> 09:32.733
- [excited chatter]

09:34.633 --> 09:35.500
- Party, there it goes.

09:35.600 --> 09:38.300
- [cell phone music]

09:38.400 --> 09:40.433
- Uh, Phoebe, the party
got moved.

09:40.533 --> 09:42.633
- Moved to where?

09:43.933 --> 09:46.133
- [dance party music]

09:49.833 --> 09:52.967
- This is our house.

09:53.067 --> 09:55.400
- Uh, Barbie,
what's goin' on?

09:55.500 --> 09:57.433
- [laughing] So like you
wouldn't let us

09:57.533 --> 09:59.067
come to your party,

09:59.100 --> 10:00.267
so we totally
threw our own.

10:00.367 --> 10:04.000
[squeals] I hope your
parents don't mind.

10:04.100 --> 10:06.267
- Yeah, wherever those
losers are.

10:06.367 --> 10:08.733
[laughing]

10:08.833 --> 10:11.367
- Par-tay!
- Oyster, no!

10:18.100 --> 10:20.467
- That was...

10:20.567 --> 10:23.767
nice!
- ALL: [hooting, cheering]

10:29.667 --> 10:33.800
- [dance party music]

10:35.467 --> 10:37.700
- [screeching]

10:37.800 --> 10:39.100
- Well, Phoebe...

10:39.200 --> 10:41.100
you said you wanted our parents
to be teenagers again.

10:41.200 --> 10:43.000
- Yeah, but I didn't
want Mom dancing

10:43.100 --> 10:45.233
and wearing my clothes?

10:45.333 --> 10:47.433
Remind me to burn those.

10:47.533 --> 10:49.300
- [straining]

10:49.400 --> 10:51.500
[laughing]

10:51.600 --> 10:53.367
- At least, he's not
wearing my clothes.

10:53.467 --> 10:55.833
- [velcro ripping]
- Ah!

10:55.933 --> 10:59.700
- Add that to
your burn pile.

10:59.800 --> 11:01.633
- [sighs] We need to turn Mom
and Dad back into adults

11:01.733 --> 11:03.100
and shut this party down.

11:03.200 --> 11:05.967
- Phoebe, what happened
to your parents?

11:06.067 --> 11:08.167
It's like you shot them
with a "cool" ray.

11:08.267 --> 11:10.833
- I shoulda used
the "cool" ray.

11:10.933 --> 11:14.467
- And, look, your mom's
even dancing with Winnie Lee.

11:14.567 --> 11:16.467
- Winnie Lee? She's here?
- Mm-hm.

11:19.400 --> 11:20.500
- Max, change of plans.

11:20.600 --> 11:22.200
We have to keep
this party going.

11:22.300 --> 11:24.133
You guys need to start
playing now.

11:24.233 --> 11:25.267
- Rock 'n Roll, brah!

11:25.367 --> 11:28.667
- She was talking about
me and Oyster.

11:28.767 --> 11:30.500
- Harsh.

11:30.600 --> 11:32.867
- Count us down, Oyster.
- Two, three, four.

11:32.967 --> 11:37.300
- [rock music]
- ALL: [cheering]

11:46.500 --> 11:49.267
- I'm spazzing out!
[zooming]

11:51.467 --> 11:54.200
- I'm spazzing out, too.
[powers zapping]

11:59.167 --> 12:01.233
- [self-conscious laughter]

12:01.333 --> 12:05.433
- Do you really think
this is a good home for a dog?

12:05.533 --> 12:07.833
I wouldn't even
let a cat live here.

12:07.933 --> 12:11.100
- Wait. It's not my fault they
ate a bunch of spazzberries.

12:11.200 --> 12:13.600
- Didn't you give them
the spazzberries?

12:13.700 --> 12:16.167
- Don't blame our fake daddy.
- Billy!

12:16.267 --> 12:17.833
- I mean our cousin daddy.

12:17.933 --> 12:19.433
Totally saved it.

12:21.167 --> 12:23.867
- I think we're done here.
- Wait!

12:23.967 --> 12:25.433
Let me say goodbye.

12:28.533 --> 12:31.167
Goodbye, Doggin.
[whimpering]

12:31.267 --> 12:32.933
- Quit slobbering.
- He can't help it.

12:33.067 --> 12:35.067
- I meant you.
- Oh.

12:35.100 --> 12:36.433
- Come.

12:36.533 --> 12:41.067
- *

12:41.133 --> 12:43.267
- [camera shutter clicks]

12:43.367 --> 12:45.200
- This is going so well.

12:45.300 --> 12:46.967
- I know.
Your social life is set.

12:47.067 --> 12:47.933
- Um, our social life
is set.

12:48.067 --> 12:50.333
- BOTH: [squealing
excitedly]

12:50.433 --> 12:51.867
- Check it out, girls.

12:51.967 --> 12:53.700
Barbie found
someone's journal.

12:53.800 --> 12:57.067
- Actually, Max likes to
call it his "thought book."

12:57.167 --> 13:00.333
That's my "thought book."
- Whatever.

13:00.433 --> 13:01.767
If you don't want
people to read it,

13:01.867 --> 13:03.233
you shouldn't leave it
locked in a drawer

13:03.333 --> 13:05.767
inside your locked
bedroom. I mean...

13:05.867 --> 13:07.900
- "Dear Diary...

13:08.067 --> 13:10.100
can you have athlete's foot,
if you're not an athlete?"

13:10.200 --> 13:12.567
- GIRLS: [laughing]
- Gimme that!

13:12.667 --> 13:15.900
- BARBIE: [gasps]
- Oh, my Gurd, Phoebe!

13:16.067 --> 13:18.433
Grabby much?

13:18.533 --> 13:19.633
- Hey, you're not cool.

13:19.733 --> 13:21.600
You need to respect
people's privacy--

13:21.700 --> 13:23.067
especially in front
of Winnie Lee.

13:23.133 --> 13:25.400
- Um, don't tell me
what to do.

13:25.500 --> 13:27.367
You're not my mother
and Winnie's my girl. Boom!

13:35.933 --> 13:38.400
- [song ends]
- ALL: [applauding, cheering]

13:40.700 --> 13:42.167
- MAX: All right, all right,
all right.

13:42.267 --> 13:43.733
This next song's called...

13:43.833 --> 13:47.200
what is my father doing?
- HANK: [laughing]

13:47.300 --> 13:48.400
- Dude, I don't think
I know that song.

13:53.100 --> 13:55.300
- Hey, hey, hey,
you can't go down there.

13:55.400 --> 13:57.167
What are you doing?
- Makin' bank, brah.

13:57.267 --> 14:02.200
A dollar gets you
a ride on the party slide.

14:02.300 --> 14:04.367
Woo!
- That's not a party slide.

14:04.467 --> 14:07.833
That's a layer slide.
- You're a layer slide.

14:07.933 --> 14:09.600
- [palm slap]

14:09.967 --> 14:11.900
- Aw...

14:12.067 --> 14:13.933
- [dance party music]

14:14.067 --> 14:15.733
- No, no, no, no.

14:15.833 --> 14:18.133
Hey, don't touch that!
Don't push that!

14:18.233 --> 14:20.467
Don't mix that!

14:21.500 --> 14:25.133
Hey, stop launching those
rockets into space--

14:25.233 --> 14:28.767
on my video game
that couldn't possibly

14:28.867 --> 14:32.800
launch actual rockets
into space.

14:32.900 --> 14:35.200
Oh, my BrainMelt!

14:35.300 --> 14:38.100
Hey, gimme that!

14:38.200 --> 14:40.600
Why isn't this
thing charged?

14:40.700 --> 14:44.067
Oh, who plugged
their phones in here?

14:46.600 --> 14:49.167
That's it, everyone out.
Don't make me get my parents.

14:49.267 --> 14:51.700
- ALL: [laughing]

14:51.800 --> 14:53.367
- Hey, everybody!

14:53.467 --> 14:56.067
Mr. Thunderman's breaking
stuff upstairs.

14:56.133 --> 14:57.867
- ALL: [cheering, hooting]

14:57.967 --> 15:00.700
- Oh, now you leave.

15:00.800 --> 15:02.333
- Oh, dude, can I charge
my phone here?

15:02.433 --> 15:03.833
- Out!

15:07.233 --> 15:10.733
- ALL: [chanting
"Hankosaur! Hankosaur!"]

15:13.133 --> 15:14.367
- [screeches]

15:14.467 --> 15:17.467
- ALL: [cheering,
applauding]

15:17.567 --> 15:19.133
- [palm slap]

15:20.533 --> 15:21.767
- Dude, your dad's
super strong.

15:21.867 --> 15:26.100
- Super? Nah, there's nothing
super about my dad.

15:26.200 --> 15:27.800
See? Anyone can do that.

15:27.900 --> 15:30.967
[bones crunch]

15:31.067 --> 15:33.100
See?
[laughing]

15:33.200 --> 15:36.167
My hand's hardly broken.

15:36.267 --> 15:38.967
- Max, thanks to Mom,

15:39.067 --> 15:40.267
Winnie's never gonna invite me
to another party again

15:40.367 --> 15:42.133
and Dad's about to expose
our secret.

15:42.233 --> 15:43.867
- That you have
athlete's foot?

15:43.967 --> 15:45.467
- I'm talking about--

15:48.533 --> 15:49.533
That secret!

15:53.167 --> 15:54.833
We need to turn Mom and Dad
back into grownups,

15:54.933 --> 15:56.400
so they can end
this party now.

15:56.500 --> 15:57.600
- Definitely.

15:57.700 --> 15:59.333
Right after Oyster and I
play our last song.

15:59.433 --> 16:03.533
- [electric guitar twanging]

16:03.633 --> 16:05.533
- All right, let's end
this party.

16:05.633 --> 16:07.600
- Where's your BrainMelt?
- Downstairs charging.

16:07.700 --> 16:08.700
- Great!
- But it needs four more hours.

16:08.800 --> 16:13.433
- Not great.
We don't have four hours.

16:13.533 --> 16:16.267
Wait, the story of Mom
and Dad's first kiss.

16:16.367 --> 16:18.767
- What? Are you trying to make
this bad night even worse?

16:18.867 --> 16:20.333
- No, I'm trying
to save it.

16:20.433 --> 16:21.667
Mom and Dad's first kiss
was electric.

16:21.767 --> 16:24.833
We could use it to supercharge
the BrainMelt 3000.

16:24.933 --> 16:26.500
- Can't we just stick
a lightning rod to it

16:26.600 --> 16:28.167
and hope for the best?

16:28.267 --> 16:29.633
- Come on, it's
just one kiss.

16:29.733 --> 16:30.467
We've just gotta get
them together.

16:30.567 --> 16:32.333
It shouldn't be too hard.

16:32.433 --> 16:34.067
- We doin' this?

16:34.133 --> 16:36.167
- Oh! As if!
[stomps foot]

16:36.267 --> 16:38.300
- [groans]

16:38.400 --> 16:39.500
- You were saying?

16:41.100 --> 16:46.600
- Waaa, Doggin. Why?

16:46.700 --> 16:50.800
- Pull yourself together,
Blobbin!

16:50.900 --> 16:52.533
- Why should I?

16:52.633 --> 16:54.800
Doggin's gone forever.

16:54.900 --> 16:57.467
- No, he's not.
The dog lady's coming back.

16:57.567 --> 16:58.800
- Why would she do that?

16:58.900 --> 17:02.367
- To give you
a second change.

17:02.467 --> 17:03.967
We also stole her keys.

17:04.067 --> 17:06.300
- And her brush.

17:06.400 --> 17:09.967
My hair has never
looked better.

17:10.067 --> 17:12.067
- I'm pretty sure
that's a dog brush.

17:12.133 --> 17:14.233
- Oh, I know.

17:14.333 --> 17:16.067
- [doorbell rings]

17:16.133 --> 17:18.500
- It's her! Now man up
and get your dog back.

17:21.567 --> 17:24.933
- I believe I left my keys.

17:25.067 --> 17:26.467
- Did you know you
also left behind

17:26.567 --> 17:27.967
the world's best
dog owner?

17:28.067 --> 17:29.567
Because that's what
Blobbin will be,

17:29.667 --> 17:30.800
if you gave him a chance.

17:30.900 --> 17:32.067
- Chances are like
belly buttons.

17:32.100 --> 17:35.533
You only get one.

17:35.633 --> 17:38.333
- Her story checks
out, guys.

17:38.433 --> 17:40.067
- I believe those are mine.

17:44.133 --> 17:45.200
- DOG: [whimpers]

17:45.300 --> 17:48.667
[barking]

17:48.767 --> 17:50.133
- [powers zapping]

17:50.233 --> 17:51.700
- [leash snaps]

17:51.800 --> 17:56.067
- Oh, I love you,
too, Doggin.

17:56.167 --> 17:57.967
- Spot, heel!

17:58.067 --> 18:00.167
- Come on, lady.
How do you say no to that?

18:00.267 --> 18:01.567
- Like this.

18:01.667 --> 18:03.567
Spot, come!
- [growling]

18:03.667 --> 18:05.067
[barks]

18:05.167 --> 18:06.967
- That's dog talk for
beat it, bossy.

18:07.067 --> 18:09.967
- Fine. Keep him.

18:10.067 --> 18:10.967
But let me say this--
- ALL: [growling]

18:11.067 --> 18:13.900
- Okay! Okay!

18:15.267 --> 18:18.433
- Oh, Billy, Nora,
how can I ever repay you?

18:18.533 --> 18:20.067
- Money works.

18:20.133 --> 18:22.267
- I have that!

18:23.133 --> 18:25.067
Yah!

18:32.367 --> 18:35.700
- Why are we down here?
The party's upstairs.

18:35.800 --> 18:38.067
- Because this is
the VIP lounge--

18:38.133 --> 18:39.133
for the cool kids.

18:39.233 --> 18:40.700
- Yeah, we thought
you guys would wanna

18:40.800 --> 18:42.300
come down here
and hang out.

18:42.400 --> 18:44.067
So, hey!

18:46.133 --> 18:47.400
We've gotta recreate
the first kiss.

18:47.500 --> 18:48.667
Right. I'll make it cold.

18:48.767 --> 18:50.667
You take him this jacket.
- Okay.

18:54.833 --> 18:57.267
- Someone looks chilly.

18:57.367 --> 18:58.467
- Oh.

18:58.567 --> 19:00.367
Good lookin' out.

19:03.167 --> 19:05.267
- It didn't work.

19:05.367 --> 19:08.067
Don't you have some kind of like
love potion or something?

19:08.100 --> 19:10.967
- Why ask me?
Ask all my girlfriends.

19:11.067 --> 19:11.800
Of course, I don't
have a love potion.

19:11.900 --> 19:13.267
That's why I'm in a band.

19:13.367 --> 19:15.333
- This is just
like you, Max.

19:15.433 --> 19:17.100
You get us into this and then
you can't get us out.

19:17.200 --> 19:19.200
- Hey, melting their brains
was your idea.

19:19.300 --> 19:21.467
- Oh, I just planted the seed.
You ran with it.

19:21.567 --> 19:22.467
- Who runs with seeds?

19:22.567 --> 19:24.900
I'm a villain,
not a farmer.

19:25.067 --> 19:26.233
- Are you crazy?
You could have--

19:26.333 --> 19:28.600
- Hey, Blabbermans,
you're missing the fireworks!

19:28.700 --> 19:32.133
- [electricity zapping]
- Gross! It's happening!

19:32.233 --> 19:32.967
- Get the BrainMelt.

19:33.067 --> 19:35.433
- Oh, good idea.
I'll puke in that.

19:35.533 --> 19:37.400
- Give me that!

19:39.933 --> 19:41.833
- [electricity zapping]

19:43.500 --> 19:45.067
- It's charged!

19:47.700 --> 19:49.833
- [electricity zapping]

19:53.667 --> 19:55.900
- Why are we in Max's lair?

19:56.067 --> 19:58.367
- And why am I wearing
Phoebe's clothes?

19:58.467 --> 20:00.733
- Max, is that
your BrainMelt?

20:00.833 --> 20:04.533
- [gasps]
Did you melt our brains?

20:04.633 --> 20:06.533
- I can't lie to you, Dad.

20:06.633 --> 20:07.500
Phoebe did it.

20:07.600 --> 20:10.100
- What? It was
both our idea.

20:10.200 --> 20:12.800
We...We wanted you guys
to remember

20:12.900 --> 20:13.900
what it was like
to be teenagers,

20:14.000 --> 20:15.900
so you would let us
go to that party.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.767
- We let you go
to that party?

20:17.867 --> 20:18.733
- You guys threw
the party.

20:21.867 --> 20:25.200
- That's right, party's over.
Everybody get out!

20:25.300 --> 20:27.900
- Keep it moving!
Come on!

20:28.000 --> 20:29.567
- I hope you
like parties...

20:29.667 --> 20:31.500
because you're going to
be at all of them.

20:31.600 --> 20:33.367
Boom!

20:33.467 --> 20:34.233
- BOTH: [excited
squealing]

20:34.333 --> 20:37.100
- Total rave, dude.

20:37.200 --> 20:37.967
Hankosaur, we hittin'
the water park tomorrow?

20:38.067 --> 20:40.267
- Out.

20:48.700 --> 20:50.833
- Sorry our parents
had to ruin all the fun.

20:50.933 --> 20:53.167
- PHOEBE & MAX:
Thank you!

20:57.400 --> 20:58.733
- [mini-vacuum whirring]

21:00.600 --> 21:02.500
- BARB: Phoebe? Max?

21:02.600 --> 21:03.633
We're hungry.

21:03.733 --> 21:07.333
- Yeah, we want breakfast!

21:07.433 --> 21:09.467
- All right, we get it.

21:09.567 --> 21:11.067
We wanted you guys
to be teenagers,

21:11.167 --> 21:12.667
you're gonna act
like teenagers.

21:12.767 --> 21:15.433
- That's right.
Now make us breakfast.

21:15.533 --> 21:20.067
- Yeah, and then clean up after
us and give us money.

21:20.167 --> 21:22.067
- Okay, we're not
doing all that.

21:22.100 --> 21:23.900
- You should totally
kiss me, Hankosaur.

21:24.067 --> 21:25.067
- BARB & HANK:
[exaggerated kissing]

21:25.167 --> 21:26.667
- Breakfast coming
right up!

21:26.767 --> 21:29.200
- [helicopter blades whirring
- Oh, look!

21:29.300 --> 21:32.133
It's our two kids
who didn't melt our brains.

21:32.233 --> 21:35.067
- HANK: Oh.

21:35.133 --> 21:36.500
- Hi!

21:36.600 --> 21:38.500
How was your night
with cousin Blobbin?

21:38.600 --> 21:41.733
- It was awesome and we learned
some valuable lessons.

21:41.833 --> 21:44.300
- Very valuable.

21:44.400 --> 21:45.567
- Yeah, we had so much fun.

21:45.667 --> 21:48.900
Though, not as much fun
as you two.

21:49.067 --> 21:51.133
- What are you
talking about?

21:51.233 --> 21:55.767
- You guys are trending.
Hashtag coolest parents ever.

21:55.867 --> 21:57.633
- BARB: Oh!
