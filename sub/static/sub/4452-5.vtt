WEBVTT

00:00.515 --> 00:01.910
Previously on Cedar Cove...

00:02.023 --> 00:03.461
Wake up. You've got competition.

00:03.491 --> 00:05.241
Warren Saget is your husband?

00:05.271 --> 00:06.097
What are you doing here, Kelly?

00:06.127 --> 00:07.504
I need a divorce.

00:07.534 --> 00:08.294
You told her you were
going to gut Nana's house?

00:08.324 --> 00:09.361
Will: Yeah.

00:09.391 --> 00:12.374
Let me buy you out, okay?

00:12.404 --> 00:13.163
I gave Cliff his ring back.

00:13.193 --> 00:15.050
We broke up for good.

00:22.722 --> 00:24.714
Missed you in court yesterday.

00:25.708 --> 00:26.699
Court?

00:26.729 --> 00:27.694
Warren...

00:27.724 --> 00:29.167
let me go.

00:30.556 --> 00:31.509
Kelly, I'm letting you go.

00:31.684 --> 00:35.041
If you let me go, I'd
be gone, but I'm here.

00:35.071 --> 00:37.030
Okay. Fine.

00:37.060 --> 00:38.537
I want the ring back.

00:38.567 --> 00:40.007
My engagement ring?

00:40.037 --> 00:41.171
That's my mother's engagement ring.

00:41.201 --> 00:42.574
I love that ring!

00:42.604 --> 00:43.979
And I loved my mother.

00:50.452 --> 00:53.088
I knew you would want this.

00:56.547 --> 00:59.731
I was sorry to hear that she passed.

01:03.808 --> 01:05.007
Yeah. Me too.

01:05.037 --> 01:06.961
She was always so sweet.

01:06.991 --> 01:08.637
I miss her cards.

01:08.667 --> 01:09.630
The birthday...

01:09.660 --> 01:11.034
Christmas.

01:11.064 --> 01:12.818
It was all the small stuff that she loved.

01:12.848 --> 01:15.488
And you.

01:15.518 --> 01:16.718
She loved you.

01:16.748 --> 01:18.019
You loved me once, too.

01:19.492 --> 01:20.928
I still do.

01:20.958 --> 01:22.846
And I always will.

01:22.876 --> 01:24.013
Just...

01:24.043 --> 01:25.965
not like a wife.

01:29.869 --> 01:31.045
So...

01:32.656 --> 01:34.502
I will see you in court?

01:35.976 --> 01:37.014
Warren?

01:38.164 --> 01:40.082
Uh, yeah. Yeah. Sure.

01:40.112 --> 01:41.452
Swear?

01:42.583 --> 01:43.779
[sighs] I'm sorry, what?

01:43.809 --> 01:44.943
Swear?

01:44.973 --> 01:46.587
Yeah. I swear. You want
me to swear? I swear.

01:46.617 --> 01:47.817
On the ring.

01:47.847 --> 01:48.809
You want me to swear
on my mother's ring now?

01:48.839 --> 01:49.904
Mm-hmm.

01:51.514 --> 01:53.739
I will be there. Okay?

02:00.513 --> 02:02.838
Cliff, you don't need
to take all your stuff.

02:02.868 --> 02:04.789
I do.

02:05.612 --> 02:06.673
Cliff!

02:06.703 --> 02:08.626
Grace, we're broken up.

02:08.656 --> 02:10.644
Your choice, not mine,

02:10.674 --> 02:13.350
which is why my stuff
doesn't need to be here.

02:14.514 --> 02:17.764
Cliff, we don't need to complicate things.

02:17.794 --> 02:20.569
Come on. It's great the way it is.

02:20.599 --> 02:21.630
It's working.

02:21.660 --> 02:25.569
Great for you... not me.

02:27.000 --> 02:33.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:54.391 --> 02:55.520
All right.

02:55.550 --> 02:59.145
I cannot decide between
the muffin or the fruit salad.

02:59.175 --> 03:01.676
You can't avoid talking
about Cliff forever.

03:01.706 --> 03:04.486
Oh, yes, I can, and I will and I am.

03:04.516 --> 03:08.136
You see, this is literally me not talking
about Cliff and trying to pretend

03:08.244 --> 03:10.112
like you're not talking about Cliff either.

03:10.142 --> 03:11.499
It's not healthy.

03:11.529 --> 03:12.903
People break up all the time.

03:12.933 --> 03:15.638
You're not "people,"
you're Grace and Cliff,

03:15.668 --> 03:17.143
and you were engaged.

03:17.173 --> 03:19.300
Technically, no. We were pre-engaged.

03:19.330 --> 03:20.703
He gave you a ring.

03:20.733 --> 03:22.377
Which I did not put on.

03:22.407 --> 03:23.674
Which is why he broke up with you.

03:23.861 --> 03:26.939
Oh, this is just crazy!
You two love each other.

03:26.969 --> 03:28.407
Yeah, I love him,

03:28.437 --> 03:30.016
but I don't want to be married again,

03:30.046 --> 03:31.794
end of story.

03:31.824 --> 03:33.334
And by the way,

03:33.364 --> 03:35.558
breaking up with Cliff
was the right thing to do.

03:35.588 --> 03:37.029
He broke up with you.

03:37.920 --> 03:39.391
Technically!

03:39.421 --> 03:41.068
Okay, how is this "the right thing to do"?

03:41.098 --> 03:43.394
I was up all night, and I made a list.

03:43.424 --> 03:44.386
A list?

03:44.416 --> 03:45.925
Wagon wheel coffee tables.

03:45.955 --> 03:47.534
You stayed up all night,

03:47.564 --> 03:49.826
and all you came up with was
wagon wheel coffee tables?

03:49.856 --> 03:51.228
And marriage!

03:51.258 --> 03:53.314
And that table was hideous.

03:53.344 --> 03:54.785
Look.

03:54.815 --> 03:56.772
Really, I'm okay with this break-up.

03:56.802 --> 03:58.720
That is exactly what you said

03:58.750 --> 04:01.045
when Miss Kitty, your pet hamster, died.

04:01.075 --> 04:03.166
And then do you remember what happened?

04:03.196 --> 04:04.841
I threw up in Band.

04:04.871 --> 04:06.037
Exactly.

04:06.067 --> 04:08.775
Well, I get sick to my
stomach when I'm upset.

04:08.805 --> 04:10.795
But see? This is just
further proof that I'm okay,

04:10.825 --> 04:12.231
because I am not sick to my stomach.

04:12.261 --> 04:13.802
Denial.

04:13.832 --> 04:14.897
Truth!

04:14.927 --> 04:16.882
What can I get you ladies?

04:16.911 --> 04:17.874
Pie!

04:17.904 --> 04:19.103
Cake!

04:19.134 --> 04:21.019
Well, you could rationalize those choices,

04:21.050 --> 04:23.312
or I could just fetch you some comfort?

04:23.342 --> 04:26.699
Comfort! A la mode. Coming up.

04:30.153 --> 04:32.446
[Grace laughs and Olivia sighs]

04:35.523 --> 04:39.045
- Hey! Good morning.
- Good morning, Paul.

04:42.774 --> 04:43.867
Hey there.

04:43.897 --> 04:47.254
Interesting dinner last night.

04:47.284 --> 04:50.129
Yeah, you could say that.

04:50.159 --> 04:51.838
Is that a 60-tooth blade?

04:51.868 --> 04:55.192
I think you'd get a
smoother cut with an 80.

04:55.222 --> 04:58.508
Sorry. Grandson of a carpenter.

04:58.538 --> 05:01.824
Well, I like the 60.

05:01.854 --> 05:03.978
But you don't like me, do you?

05:04.008 --> 05:06.064
No. And you're wrong.

05:06.094 --> 05:09.108
I am? So this is what it
feels like to have you like me?

05:09.138 --> 05:11.057
No. You're wrong about the blade.

05:11.087 --> 05:12.527
The 60 is much better than the 80

05:12.557 --> 05:14.032
with this type of wood.

05:14.062 --> 05:15.399
Sometimes...

05:15.429 --> 05:17.997
smooth is...

05:18.027 --> 05:20.598
just too slick.

05:22.001 --> 05:23.368
Hmm.

05:23.398 --> 05:25.523
Plus, I find that the
blade that you started with

05:25.553 --> 05:27.780
is the blade you should finish with.

05:27.810 --> 05:29.831
Okay.

05:29.861 --> 05:32.430
Nice talk.

05:39.104 --> 05:41.393
You were engaged to Warren?

05:41.423 --> 05:43.068
But I heard his wife was here.

05:43.098 --> 05:44.914
His wife?

05:44.944 --> 05:46.182
Where did you hear that?

05:46.212 --> 05:48.542
The dinner party at your mom's.

05:48.572 --> 05:50.082
I can't say I'm surprised.

05:50.112 --> 05:52.203
It is Warren Saget.

05:52.233 --> 05:53.883
Okay, so the engagement didn't work out?

05:53.913 --> 05:56.107
Why didn't you just tell me?

05:56.137 --> 05:57.849
I don't know.

05:57.879 --> 05:59.766
[sighs] You still have feelings for him?

05:59.796 --> 06:00.793
No!

06:00.823 --> 06:02.198
It's no big deal.

06:02.228 --> 06:05.175
No. Not telling me, that's the big deal.

06:06.340 --> 06:09.041
[♪♪♪]

06:13.625 --> 06:15.780
[SUV door opens and shuts]

06:15.810 --> 06:17.148
She's nice.

06:17.178 --> 06:18.243
She's lying.

06:18.273 --> 06:19.715
What?

06:19.745 --> 06:21.052
About who she is.

06:21.082 --> 06:23.687
What are you talking about?

06:23.717 --> 06:26.116
Her driver's license says
her name is Laura Moore.

06:26.146 --> 06:27.894
You went through her purse?

06:27.924 --> 06:30.459
Wallet. It was an accident!

06:30.489 --> 06:32.956
Just watch yourself, Miss Friendly.

06:32.986 --> 06:35.419
There's something not right
about our new neighbor.

06:43.932 --> 06:47.557
You were kind of quiet in the meeting.

06:47.587 --> 06:49.676
My mind's a little preoccupied.

06:49.706 --> 06:51.251
Yeah?

06:51.281 --> 06:53.063
I've got a lunch to go to in Seattle.

06:53.093 --> 06:55.665
Ah. Work?

06:55.695 --> 06:57.753
Good friend's having a birthday party.

06:57.783 --> 06:59.188
Okay.

06:59.218 --> 07:00.762
I have to go,

07:00.792 --> 07:02.541
but I really don't want to.

07:02.571 --> 07:04.081
Why?

07:04.111 --> 07:05.690
'Cause it's at Flanagan's.

07:05.720 --> 07:09.655
Right. I remember Flanagan's happy hour.

07:09.685 --> 07:12.633
Known for their very generous drinks.

07:12.663 --> 07:14.308
That's the problem.

07:14.338 --> 07:16.771
You know, I'm gonna be in
Seattle today with work,

07:16.801 --> 07:18.037
I could come by.

07:18.067 --> 07:20.502
I do not need to cause any more trouble

07:20.532 --> 07:21.767
between you and Olivia.

07:21.797 --> 07:23.715
She understands that we're just friends.

07:23.745 --> 07:26.759
But I don't think she's okay with it.

07:26.789 --> 07:30.244
And I'm not okay with you
being dragged into my stuff.

07:30.274 --> 07:32.983
I'll be all right.

07:33.013 --> 07:34.625
Thanks, though.

07:40.064 --> 07:41.499
Kelly: It belongs to his family!

07:41.529 --> 07:42.833
Oh! Okay. Now I get
it. Honey, now I get it.

07:42.863 --> 07:43.961
Warren.

07:45.602 --> 07:46.694
Justine!

07:46.724 --> 07:48.198
Why are you looking surprised?

07:48.228 --> 07:49.634
This is my office.

07:49.664 --> 07:51.618
My Uncle wanted me to drop this off to you.

07:51.648 --> 07:52.987
That's nice of him. Tell him thank you.

07:53.017 --> 07:54.458
Goodbye.

07:54.488 --> 07:57.705
Hi. I'm Kelly. Warren's wife.

07:57.735 --> 08:00.921
Oh, technically,
soon-to-be ex-wife.

08:00.951 --> 08:02.496
I'm Justine.

08:02.526 --> 08:04.072
And how do you know Warren?

08:04.102 --> 08:05.782
I'm his ex-fiancee.

08:05.812 --> 08:07.492
I guess we have the "ex" thing in common.

08:07.522 --> 08:08.927
Right! Yes! [forced laugh]

08:08.957 --> 08:10.776
That whole "ex" thing is
really funny, isn't it?

08:10.806 --> 08:13.413
I mean, Kelly, Justine. Justine, Kelly.

08:13.443 --> 08:15.805
Never great to see you
again, but the door! Let's go.

08:15.835 --> 08:17.173
When were you engaged?

08:17.203 --> 08:19.465
I think while you were married.

08:19.495 --> 08:22.510
My Warren has a history

08:22.540 --> 08:24.565
of playing fast and loose with the truth.

08:24.595 --> 08:26.583
When we met, he told me
he was fluent in French.

08:26.613 --> 08:28.122
He told me he was a marathon runner.

08:28.152 --> 08:30.004
I took him on a 5K and
he almost passed out.

08:30.034 --> 08:31.099
[snickers]

08:31.129 --> 08:32.669
[forced laugh] That's great.

08:32.700 --> 08:35.303
Beautiful memories for another time...

08:35.332 --> 08:37.424
and those special moments
with my two special ladies.

08:37.453 --> 08:39.307
Justine! Get out.

08:39.337 --> 08:41.429
Stop it. He is such a bear.

08:41.458 --> 08:42.626
Such a bear.

08:42.655 --> 08:45.361
Well, actually, he's a pretty good guy.

08:45.391 --> 08:46.523
You don't say.

08:46.553 --> 08:48.131
He just doesn't always show it.

08:48.161 --> 08:51.795
Wow. You're painting a
very positive portrait here.

08:52.651 --> 08:53.709
I should go.

08:53.739 --> 08:54.939
Oh, finally. Yes.

08:54.969 --> 08:57.952
Sad to see you go, but not really. Bye.

08:57.982 --> 08:59.526
Married?

08:59.556 --> 09:00.994
While you were married to me?

09:01.024 --> 09:03.083
No, no, no! We were engaged.
We were never married.

09:03.113 --> 09:04.726
- Seriously?
- Totally not the same.

09:04.756 --> 09:06.133
Never married.

09:06.163 --> 09:08.525
Oh, yeah, and that just
makes it so much better.

09:08.555 --> 09:11.504
Well...
it's, uh...

09:15.542 --> 09:18.826
So? Why the long face?

09:18.856 --> 09:20.743
I didn't tell Luke about Warren,

09:20.773 --> 09:22.968
and then Warren told
Luke that we were engaged,

09:22.998 --> 09:24.541
and now Luke's upset with me.

09:24.571 --> 09:26.557
Oh. Okay, so what you do

09:26.587 --> 09:27.858
is you just go talk to him

09:27.888 --> 09:29.363
and just keep on talking

09:29.393 --> 09:32.234
until eventually he'll forget
why he's upset with you.

09:32.264 --> 09:33.635
And that works?

09:33.665 --> 09:34.660
Worked with wife number one

09:34.690 --> 09:36.407
and with wife number three.

09:36.437 --> 09:39.589
Not so much with wife number two.

09:39.619 --> 09:40.581
You've been married three times?

09:40.611 --> 09:41.951
Uh, four.

09:41.981 --> 09:43.524
I'm a lover not a fighter.

09:43.554 --> 09:45.543
[both chuckling]

09:46.776 --> 09:48.655
This is for you.

09:49.648 --> 09:51.253
Who's he?

09:51.283 --> 09:52.724
That's a local fisherman

09:52.754 --> 09:55.326
looking for a crewman for his boat.

09:55.356 --> 09:57.925
You have the hands of a man of the sea.

09:57.955 --> 09:58.917
Thanks.

09:58.947 --> 10:00.492
Mm.

10:00.522 --> 10:02.579
You take care now.

10:06.683 --> 10:08.152
You know that guy?

10:08.182 --> 10:10.446
Well, he's staying at
the motel up the road.

10:10.476 --> 10:12.158
Did you tell him about the Thyme and Tide?

10:12.188 --> 10:13.697
I don't think he's here on a vacation.

10:13.727 --> 10:15.168
Well, why is he here?

10:15.198 --> 10:17.528
He's, uh, on the run.

10:17.558 --> 10:19.820
- From what?
- His life, I think.

10:19.850 --> 10:21.257
I don't understand.

10:21.287 --> 10:22.933
Mm, he's got problems

10:22.963 --> 10:25.293
and he felt it was better
to deal with those problems

10:25.323 --> 10:27.209
away from his wife and his daughter.

10:27.239 --> 10:28.235
Do you know him?

10:28.265 --> 10:29.261
No. I just met him.

10:29.291 --> 10:30.766
And he told you all of that?

10:30.796 --> 10:32.954
Well, he needed to tell someone.

10:32.984 --> 10:36.066
Sometimes it's easier to talk
to a stranger about how you feel

10:36.096 --> 10:37.436
than someone who knows you.

10:37.466 --> 10:38.769
Can I get you anything else?

10:38.799 --> 10:42.187
No. Thanks.

10:42.217 --> 10:44.378
[♪♪♪]

10:51.014 --> 10:52.143
[knocking]

10:52.173 --> 10:53.135
Come in.

10:53.165 --> 10:54.469
Hi. Rebecca's gonna

10:54.499 --> 11:06.271
get you the sentencing recommendations

11:06.301 --> 11:08.597
and disagreements with
people that they love.

11:08.627 --> 11:10.377
Well, what can I do for you?

11:10.407 --> 11:14.040
Well, I was, uh, thinking
about getting a rental house.

11:14.070 --> 11:15.442
Do you know an agent?

11:15.472 --> 11:17.291
Is there a problem with the Thyme and Tide?

11:18.216 --> 11:19.481
Uh...

11:19.511 --> 11:20.713
you.

11:20.743 --> 11:22.254
Me?

11:22.284 --> 11:23.519
- Us?
- There's an "us"?

11:23.549 --> 11:24.649
I think Bob thinks so.

11:24.679 --> 11:26.598
That's just silly!

11:26.628 --> 11:28.925
I don't think Bob thinks so.

11:28.955 --> 11:30.363
Well, he and Jack are really close.

11:30.393 --> 11:33.037
He's his sponsor and kind of surrogate Dad.

11:33.067 --> 11:34.305
They're really good friends.

11:34.335 --> 11:36.220
Does Jack think there's something going on?

11:36.250 --> 11:37.795
There isn't anything going on,

11:37.825 --> 11:40.156
so it doesn't matter what
anyone thinks, but no.

11:40.186 --> 11:42.002
It's just that sometimes

11:42.032 --> 11:45.940
people's perceptions can
have more sway than the facts.

11:45.970 --> 11:47.550
An injunction?

11:47.580 --> 11:49.294
You had me served?

11:49.324 --> 11:51.039
At Mom's house!

11:51.069 --> 11:52.203
Nice touch.

11:52.233 --> 11:53.605
- I'm working.
- I don't care.

11:53.635 --> 11:55.007
I do.

11:55.037 --> 11:57.505
You did what you had to
do. I did what I had to do.

11:57.535 --> 11:59.525
This piece of paper doesn't mean anything.

11:59.555 --> 12:01.507
That piece of paper is a legal document,

12:01.537 --> 12:03.936
and if you so much as remove a nail

12:03.966 --> 12:05.511
without my prior written consent,

12:05.541 --> 12:07.393
you'll find yourself in front of a judge.

12:07.423 --> 12:09.173
A judge who's your friend!

12:09.203 --> 12:12.558
You be very careful what you
say about me, William Jeffers.

12:12.588 --> 12:14.681
That is my reputation and integrity

12:14.711 --> 12:16.290
that you're bandying about!

12:16.320 --> 12:20.566
I will not tolerate slander
or disrespect of any kind,

12:20.596 --> 12:21.971
do you understand?

12:22.001 --> 12:23.817
- You...
- No, you!

12:23.847 --> 12:25.563
You wanted to bring down the thunder?

12:25.593 --> 12:27.786
Well, you got it, so go
buy yourself an umbrella.

12:27.816 --> 12:29.699
I'll see you in court.

12:41.365 --> 12:43.149
[door opens, knocking]

12:43.279 --> 12:44.372
Is this a bad time?

12:44.402 --> 12:45.982
It's perfect timing.

12:46.012 --> 12:47.011
I'm on recess.

12:47.244 --> 12:48.450
- [door shuts]
- Is everything okay?

12:48.480 --> 12:49.560
Yeah! Yeah.

12:49.590 --> 12:51.336
I'm just off to Seattle for work.

12:51.366 --> 12:52.225
Oh?

12:52.255 --> 12:54.074
I thought I would say goodbye.

12:54.104 --> 12:55.410
That's nice.

12:55.440 --> 12:57.290
You know...

12:57.320 --> 13:00.640
I kind of miss the goodbyes

13:00.670 --> 13:02.690
and the hellos.

13:02.720 --> 13:04.813
And you?

13:07.346 --> 13:09.328
Oh, my bad.

13:09.358 --> 13:10.594
I'll come back later.

13:11.691 --> 13:13.401
Jack.

13:13.431 --> 13:14.462
[door thuds]

13:14.492 --> 13:15.693
Right.

13:15.723 --> 13:17.781
Well, um...

13:18.810 --> 13:20.894
You know, tonight, if I'm not too late...

13:21.935 --> 13:23.107
we could maybe do dinner?

13:23.284 --> 13:24.992
I would really like that.

13:25.848 --> 13:27.181
Just give me a call.

13:27.211 --> 13:28.651
Okay.

13:28.681 --> 13:30.804
Talk to you later.

13:41.345 --> 13:43.123
Luke?

13:43.153 --> 13:44.833
Matt?

13:44.863 --> 13:45.926
In the flesh!

13:45.956 --> 13:46.953
What are you doing in Cedar Cove?

13:46.983 --> 13:48.425
I mean, what are you doing here?

13:48.455 --> 13:49.831
I'm looking for Derek.

13:49.861 --> 13:51.507
A guy named Moon sent
me. I'm looking for a job.

13:51.537 --> 13:52.775
Yeah, he'll be back later today.

13:52.805 --> 13:55.819
Man, it is good to see you.

13:55.849 --> 13:58.317
[both laughing]

14:05.338 --> 14:06.947
Okay, what is it?

14:06.977 --> 14:08.315
What?

14:08.345 --> 14:10.366
Come on! You've barely said two words.

14:10.396 --> 14:11.632
Oh.

14:11.662 --> 14:13.720
Look, if this is about my Seahawks article,

14:13.750 --> 14:15.602
I happen to think that was a great article.

14:15.632 --> 14:17.758
It was. It was!

14:17.788 --> 14:19.570
What? Now you're complimenting me?

14:19.600 --> 14:20.800
What?

14:20.830 --> 14:25.554
Ah, Jeri! What is going on here?

14:25.584 --> 14:27.609
[sighs] I'm having some issues at work.

14:27.639 --> 14:28.942
Oh.

14:28.972 --> 14:30.517
Management is not happy with me.

14:30.547 --> 14:31.508
Come on. Are you sure?

14:31.538 --> 14:32.638
Well, I wasn't sure,

14:32.668 --> 14:34.657
until they called me in and said,

14:34.687 --> 14:36.299
"Jeri, we're not happy with you."

14:36.329 --> 14:38.353
Look, uh,

14:38.383 --> 14:39.997
circulation is down and costs are up.

14:40.027 --> 14:40.853
Oh, man.

14:40.883 --> 14:43.419
Wait a minute.

14:43.449 --> 14:45.370
Are you letting me go?

14:45.400 --> 14:46.705
They love you.

14:46.735 --> 14:48.450
- They do?
- Yeah.

14:48.480 --> 14:49.749
Everyone does.

14:49.779 --> 14:51.937
Me, not so much.

14:51.967 --> 14:53.477
Wow. Well, look.

14:53.507 --> 14:54.846
If there's something
I can do to help...

14:54.876 --> 14:56.317
Really?

14:56.347 --> 14:57.788
Yes! Of course. Look, you hired me.

14:57.818 --> 14:59.703
I have vested interest in you succeeding.

15:00.340 --> 15:03.931
Plus, you know, I'm actually a nice guy.

15:03.961 --> 15:06.429
Yes. You are.

15:07.389 --> 15:08.552
And no.

15:08.582 --> 15:10.607
There's nothing you can do.

15:10.637 --> 15:13.137
Let's go.

15:30.287 --> 15:31.962
You okay?

15:31.992 --> 15:33.398
[Olivia sighs]

15:33.428 --> 15:35.243
Will should not have come by the office,

15:35.273 --> 15:36.544
but that's what he does...

15:36.574 --> 15:37.846
He shows up and causes trouble,

15:37.876 --> 15:38.908
usually for me.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.687
I get it.

15:40.717 --> 15:43.183
Thanks.

15:43.213 --> 15:44.756
And now I have to get ready

15:44.786 --> 15:48.144
to appear in court with my brother.

15:48.174 --> 15:49.308
Unbelievable.

15:49.338 --> 15:51.391
I hated filing the injunction,

15:51.421 --> 15:53.410
but I just don't trust Will
to leave the property alone

15:53.440 --> 15:54.984
until we get it all sorted out.

15:55.014 --> 15:58.304
Can I offer you a piece
of unsolicited advice?

15:58.334 --> 15:59.399
Sure.

15:59.429 --> 16:01.314
I probably shouldn't say this,

16:01.344 --> 16:02.374
but if I were in your position,

16:02.404 --> 16:04.599
I'd want someone to remind me.

16:04.629 --> 16:06.824
Remind me?

16:06.854 --> 16:09.665
The only people who win in court

16:09.695 --> 16:11.342
are the lawyers

16:11.372 --> 16:13.359
who rack up the fees.

16:13.389 --> 16:15.274
I just don't want you losing

16:15.304 --> 16:17.943
more than a piece of property here.

16:18.901 --> 16:20.576
You're right.

16:20.606 --> 16:22.938
You shouldn't have said anything.

16:26.225 --> 16:28.483
[♪♪♪]

16:38.949 --> 16:40.899
Well, the whole town is abuzz.

16:40.929 --> 16:42.303
Warren's got a wife.

16:42.333 --> 16:43.739
Who knew?

16:43.769 --> 16:45.280
Well, I hear she's nice.

16:45.310 --> 16:46.785
I still think he's a creep.

16:46.815 --> 16:48.974
Yeah, well, a tale as old as time.

16:49.004 --> 16:50.239
That it is.

16:50.269 --> 16:51.708
Sure am glad you're here, though,

16:51.738 --> 16:53.144
because I could so use your help.

16:53.174 --> 16:54.921
Ahh. With Cliff?

16:54.951 --> 16:56.495
No!

16:56.525 --> 16:59.130
No. I have got this great
idea to give out free bikes

16:59.160 --> 17:01.250
to people in town.

17:01.280 --> 17:03.135
Now, we'll just start with, say,
a couple of bike stations and...

17:03.165 --> 17:05.288
Oh, you know, I gotta go,
I gotta go to the library,

17:05.318 --> 17:06.623
but let's just get together later

17:06.653 --> 17:08.882
and then we can talk
this whole thing through.

17:08.912 --> 17:10.183
It's our anniversary, Grace,

17:10.213 --> 17:11.861
so, no.

17:11.891 --> 17:12.923
Sorry, I can't.

17:12.953 --> 17:14.256
How many years?

17:14.286 --> 17:16.275
30, and counting.

17:16.305 --> 17:17.300
[gasps] 30! Oh, my gosh!

17:17.330 --> 17:19.900
What are you gonna do?

17:19.930 --> 17:22.123
That's huge! You've got to have a party.

17:22.153 --> 17:23.798
You have to have a party!

17:23.828 --> 17:25.578
Why don't you let me plan
it? I would love to plan it.

17:25.608 --> 17:27.186
Really, I could invite everybody,

17:27.217 --> 17:29.103
and we could just... Please?

17:29.133 --> 17:32.522
Pegs and I started this life journey alone,

17:32.552 --> 17:33.892
and that's kind of the way

17:33.922 --> 17:36.118
we like to spend our anniversaries.

17:36.148 --> 17:38.580
Alone, but thanks.

17:38.610 --> 17:40.904
Oh, that is just so sweet.

17:40.934 --> 17:43.540
Grace, um...

17:43.570 --> 17:46.720
I know this from my own experience.

17:48.225 --> 17:51.167
Ignoring pain doesn't make it go away.

17:51.197 --> 17:53.872
Actually makes it worse.

17:53.902 --> 17:55.514
I am not in pain, Bob.

17:55.544 --> 17:58.798
Really. I mean, the truth of the matter

17:58.828 --> 18:00.578
is that I feel relieved.

18:00.608 --> 18:01.709
The ring in my purse

18:01.739 --> 18:03.729
was just really starting to weigh on me,

18:03.759 --> 18:04.687
and this is better.

18:04.717 --> 18:06.668
Really.

18:09.784 --> 18:11.665
So where was your last deployment?

18:11.695 --> 18:12.862
Afghanistan.

18:12.892 --> 18:15.394
How'd you end up here?

18:15.424 --> 18:17.858
Well, just finished up
a commercial fishing gig

18:17.888 --> 18:19.466
in Port Orchard.

18:19.496 --> 18:21.105
Just been kind of
drifting since the divorce.

18:21.135 --> 18:22.270
And your daughter?

18:22.300 --> 18:23.706
She took her

18:23.736 --> 18:25.759
and moved in with her
parents in North Carolina.

18:25.789 --> 18:27.675
[sighs heavily]

18:27.705 --> 18:29.761
I'm good.

18:29.791 --> 18:31.780
Hey, I gotta take the
boat out in the morning

18:31.810 --> 18:33.147
and grab some crabbing bins.

18:33.177 --> 18:33.899
Why don't you come early
and we'll make a day of it?

18:33.929 --> 18:35.097
0800?

18:35.127 --> 18:39.098
0600. And I'll talk to
Derek about that job.

18:39.128 --> 18:41.767
Copy that. Thanks.

18:41.797 --> 18:42.826
Yeah.

18:44.128 --> 18:46.929
[♪♪♪]

18:55.790 --> 18:57.125
Hey.

18:59.761 --> 19:03.182
I wanted to finish our
"Warren" conversation.

19:03.212 --> 19:04.928
[sighing]

19:04.958 --> 19:06.844
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

19:06.874 --> 19:08.758
I mean, who cares about Warren?

19:08.788 --> 19:10.023
I care about you.

19:11.735 --> 19:12.830
I should have told you.

19:13.234 --> 19:15.388
I'm sure there are things
that I should tell you...

19:15.418 --> 19:16.722
but we'll get there.

19:16.752 --> 19:18.263
We got time.

19:19.495 --> 19:21.202
So, do you know that guy?

19:21.232 --> 19:23.595
Yeah. We went through training together.

19:23.625 --> 19:25.135
He's in the Navy?

19:25.165 --> 19:26.298
Retired S.E.A.L., like me.

19:26.328 --> 19:27.596
Oh.

19:27.626 --> 19:29.032
What?

19:29.062 --> 19:32.142
Well, maybe you could get him some help.

19:32.172 --> 19:33.614
Trying to get him a job.

19:33.644 --> 19:34.846
No, I mean, like at the base,

19:34.876 --> 19:36.352
with your group.

19:36.382 --> 19:38.165
Why?

19:38.195 --> 19:39.943
Well, Moon said

19:39.973 --> 19:41.347
that he's been kind of
running away from his wife

19:41.377 --> 19:42.816
and his life.

19:42.846 --> 19:44.389
No. He's not running. He's divorced.

19:44.419 --> 19:45.656
He's not divorced.

19:45.686 --> 19:46.716
That's what he told me.

19:46.746 --> 19:47.981
It's not what he told Moon.

19:57.586 --> 19:59.602
- [laughs]
- Hey!

19:59.703 --> 20:00.898
This is a nice surprise.

20:01.534 --> 20:03.237
Are you off to that birthday party?

20:03.267 --> 20:05.014
- Yeah, wish me luck.
- Okay.

20:05.044 --> 20:06.108
You heading home?

20:06.138 --> 20:08.228
Yep. Yeah.

20:08.258 --> 20:11.088
Are you sure this is such a
good idea, going to that party?

20:11.282 --> 20:12.564
- I'll be fine.
- Yeah?

20:13.610 --> 20:14.682
I'll be fine.

20:15.402 --> 20:17.347
Do you want me to at least walk you there?

20:17.377 --> 20:19.777
You're going to Cedar Cove,
no time for babysitting.

20:19.807 --> 20:22.449
Jack, go. I will be fine.

20:23.373 --> 20:25.561
Okay.

20:28.916 --> 20:30.213
You know what?

20:30.243 --> 20:31.788
I am gonna stay for lunch.

20:31.818 --> 20:33.568
Know any good places?

20:33.598 --> 20:35.554
[laughing]

20:37.026 --> 20:39.936
Come on. Let's go.

20:40.862 --> 20:42.573
So? How's Grace?

20:42.603 --> 20:45.826
Denial. Deep denial.

20:45.856 --> 20:47.297
She needs a good kick in the...

20:47.327 --> 20:49.005
Oh! I think they both do.

20:49.035 --> 20:50.851
Oh? What did Cliff do wrong?

20:50.881 --> 20:53.521
He dropped down in some dirty barn.

20:53.551 --> 20:55.471
Yeah! I thought

20:55.501 --> 20:57.558
you ladies liked spontaneous.

20:57.588 --> 20:58.655
Well, maybe she thought

20:58.685 --> 21:00.026
he didn't put enough
thought into asking her,

21:00.056 --> 21:01.700
which is why, now,

21:01.730 --> 21:02.932
she's put way too much thought

21:02.962 --> 21:04.982
into whether or not she
wants to get married.

21:05.012 --> 21:06.623
Good rule of thumb...

21:06.653 --> 21:08.641
If there is horse excrement nearby,

21:08.671 --> 21:11.068
find another locale to propose.

21:11.098 --> 21:12.366
[chuckles]

21:12.396 --> 21:13.974
Well, if I remember correctly,

21:14.004 --> 21:16.847
I gave you a ring I found
in a box of Cracker Jacks.

21:16.877 --> 21:20.784
Mm. Almost 30 years for this one.

21:20.814 --> 21:22.908
I like this one better.

21:25.030 --> 21:26.840
I know that look.

21:26.870 --> 21:28.721
I think we need to help our friends.

21:28.751 --> 21:30.397
Me too. How?

21:30.427 --> 21:32.144
Come on.

21:32.174 --> 21:33.171
[chuckles]

21:34.302 --> 21:35.704
Hey, you.

21:35.734 --> 21:37.688
Hi.

21:38.786 --> 21:41.626
Um...

21:41.656 --> 21:42.686
I just wanted to say

21:42.716 --> 21:44.362
that I was out of line

21:44.392 --> 21:47.746
to talk about your family and court.

21:47.776 --> 21:49.422
I'm the eldest of six,

21:49.452 --> 21:51.578
so I was the one who
ended up giving advice,

21:51.608 --> 21:55.646
and I guess I just got
used to giving advice.

21:56.535 --> 21:57.765
All my life,

21:57.795 --> 22:00.262
my brother has done everything wrong.

22:00.292 --> 22:02.317
And you did everything right?

22:02.347 --> 22:03.787
Yes.

22:03.817 --> 22:05.430
And... [chuckles]

22:05.460 --> 22:08.341
You weren't out of line.

22:08.371 --> 22:09.848
Well, then what was I?

22:09.878 --> 22:11.832
You gave me an honest opinion.

22:11.862 --> 22:14.568
And that's something you like?

22:14.598 --> 22:16.862
I do.

22:18.437 --> 22:21.343
He's family.

22:21.373 --> 22:22.747
You're gonna have to find another way.

22:22.777 --> 22:25.347
I know.

22:25.377 --> 22:26.579
Did you eat lunch?

22:26.609 --> 22:27.572
No.

22:27.602 --> 22:29.352
Well!

22:29.382 --> 22:31.097
No more hot dogs.

22:31.127 --> 22:32.262
Salad?

22:32.292 --> 22:33.494
Okay.

22:33.524 --> 22:34.590
My treat.

22:34.620 --> 22:35.582
You don't have to.

22:35.612 --> 22:37.224
I want to.

22:37.254 --> 22:38.623
Come on.

22:38.653 --> 22:40.849
I'll buy you your bunny food.

22:46.698 --> 22:49.638
Kelly: What's it gonna take, Warren?

22:51.043 --> 22:52.378
Dinner.

22:52.408 --> 22:54.222
Excuse me?

22:54.252 --> 22:55.455
Dinner.

22:55.485 --> 22:58.160
You and me, tonight.

22:58.190 --> 22:59.151
Warren...

22:59.181 --> 23:00.760
Kelly, look.

23:00.790 --> 23:03.393
We started this marriage
with champagne and cake.

23:03.423 --> 23:05.719
Don't you think we should
end it the same way?

23:05.749 --> 23:07.259
So if I go to dinner...

23:07.289 --> 23:09.414
Mm-hmm? -You'll
sign the papers?

23:09.444 --> 23:12.562
Yes.

23:12.592 --> 23:14.307
I just want one last meal.

23:14.337 --> 23:15.334
As long as you know

23:15.364 --> 23:17.902
this meal will change nothing.

23:17.932 --> 23:20.399
I do.

23:25.293 --> 23:26.558
One meal.

23:28.475 --> 23:32.001
It's still hard for me to say no to you.

23:34.328 --> 23:36.516
[exhales deeply]

23:37.612 --> 23:39.493
Matt is fine.

23:39.523 --> 23:41.067
I don't think he is.

23:41.097 --> 23:42.502
I could look into some services

23:42.532 --> 23:44.079
that could help him,

23:44.109 --> 23:45.448
or you could talk to your
counselor at the base.

23:45.478 --> 23:47.533
But we don't even know if
he's got PTSD or whatever.

23:47.563 --> 23:49.689
- Well, Moon said...
- I will talk to Matt.

23:49.719 --> 23:52.528
We could talk to him together.

23:52.558 --> 23:55.059
I could help. I want to help.

23:56.086 --> 23:57.588
I got this.

23:57.618 --> 23:59.161
Okay?

23:59.191 --> 24:00.494
He's my friend.

24:01.691 --> 24:03.230
Okay.

24:03.260 --> 24:04.497
I know, but...

24:05.525 --> 24:07.096
Let me handle it.

24:08.189 --> 24:22.255
[♪♪♪]

24:22.285 --> 24:23.452
Peggy is really upset with me.

24:23.482 --> 24:24.854
- Peggy?
- Apparently...

24:24.884 --> 24:26.836
she doesn't want to
spend this anniversary alone.

24:26.866 --> 24:28.172
She wants a party.

24:28.202 --> 24:30.053
She was expecting a party.

24:30.083 --> 24:31.046
What'd you say?

24:31.076 --> 24:32.310
I just smiled

24:32.340 --> 24:34.225
and I said I didn't want
to ruin the surprise.

24:34.255 --> 24:36.142
And the surprise being...?

24:36.172 --> 24:37.476
That, after all this time,

24:37.506 --> 24:39.357
she wants to do something different.

24:39.387 --> 24:40.966
You can do this.

24:40.996 --> 24:42.094
I can?

24:42.124 --> 24:43.256
Sure! We can do this.

24:43.286 --> 24:45.069
I can't expect you to help.

24:45.099 --> 24:46.403
Bob, we don't have time

24:46.433 --> 24:47.804
for you to pretend that
you didn't come in here

24:47.834 --> 24:49.960
to get me to throw a party for Peggy.

24:49.990 --> 24:51.500
- Okay.
- All right!

24:51.530 --> 24:52.561
[thumps table] So...

24:52.591 --> 24:55.198
let's get this party started.

24:56.839 --> 24:59.576
I like the sound of that.

25:01.322 --> 25:04.090
[loud laughter and chatter]

25:05.836 --> 25:07.479
Piece of advice?

25:07.509 --> 25:10.319
A lesson I keep learning

25:10.349 --> 25:12.234
and relearning...

25:12.264 --> 25:14.904
Choose your friends wisely.

25:14.934 --> 25:16.920
She's not always like this.

25:16.950 --> 25:17.980
Alex.

25:18.010 --> 25:20.990
I hear you.

25:21.020 --> 25:22.289
You know, we could just leave.

25:22.319 --> 25:23.452
Well, you can.

25:23.482 --> 25:25.707
Nope! Nope. Never leave a man behind.

25:25.737 --> 25:27.519
Look, I can't run from life.

25:27.549 --> 25:30.528
I'm gonna have to deal
with things like this.

25:31.933 --> 25:33.301
Okay.

25:33.331 --> 25:36.208
Well, I find, when I can't run,

25:36.238 --> 25:37.847
then I've got to figure out

25:37.877 --> 25:39.935
a way through it.

25:39.965 --> 25:42.126
A situation like this requires a plan.

25:42.156 --> 25:43.734
A plan?

25:43.764 --> 25:44.964
- Yes.
- Mm.

25:44.994 --> 25:46.162
To survive this place,

25:46.192 --> 25:49.208
we need a distraction.

25:50.339 --> 25:52.666
Bingo. Do you play?

25:52.696 --> 25:54.138
Yeah.

25:54.168 --> 25:55.404
Let's play.

25:55.434 --> 25:57.251
Okay, don't you have to
be getting back to town?

25:57.281 --> 25:58.346
No, I can catch the last ferry

25:58.376 --> 26:00.398
and still make dinner with Olivia.

26:00.428 --> 26:02.110
You really want to play pool?

26:02.140 --> 26:03.854
Well, it's either that,

26:03.884 --> 26:05.668
or continue watching
your friends get loaded.

26:05.698 --> 26:06.660
Your choice.

26:06.690 --> 26:07.653
Yeah. Pool is good.

26:07.683 --> 26:08.646
Okay!

26:08.676 --> 26:10.221
[Jack slaps his knees]

26:10.251 --> 26:12.749
[♪♪♪]

26:21.235 --> 26:23.078
I need your help.

26:23.108 --> 26:24.446
Name it.

26:24.476 --> 26:27.597
I want to get my brother
to agree to mediation,

26:27.627 --> 26:29.273
you know, with the house.

26:29.303 --> 26:30.333
Great.

26:30.363 --> 26:31.358
Good! Good.

26:31.388 --> 26:32.760
You avoid court...

26:33.685 --> 26:34.780
No.

26:34.810 --> 26:35.979
No.

26:36.009 --> 26:37.278
No, no, please?

26:37.308 --> 26:38.988
I don't know who else to ask.

26:39.018 --> 26:39.945
I'll give you a list!

26:39.975 --> 26:41.486
- It has to be you.
- Why?

26:41.516 --> 26:42.957
Well, because you don't know Will,

26:42.987 --> 26:44.121
you don't really know me.

26:44.151 --> 26:45.455
I know you enough to know

26:45.485 --> 26:46.823
that I don't want to arbitrate a deal

26:46.853 --> 26:49.147
between you and your brother.

26:49.177 --> 26:52.123
Everyone in town, they know Will and me.

26:52.153 --> 26:53.288
It's prejudicial,

26:53.318 --> 26:54.758
and I don't want an advantage.

26:54.788 --> 26:57.222
I don't want him to have a disadvantage.

26:57.252 --> 26:59.101
He's not real popular here.

26:59.131 --> 27:00.710
So, tell me, were you the model

27:00.740 --> 27:03.139
for that lady with the
scales and the blindfold?

27:03.169 --> 27:04.574
'Cause you have the same hair.

27:04.604 --> 27:05.770
Would you be serious, please?

27:05.800 --> 27:06.968
I seriously don't want to be

27:06.998 --> 27:08.134
in the middle of a family argument.

27:08.164 --> 27:09.332
Seriously.

27:09.362 --> 27:11.211
Please?

27:13.161 --> 27:15.863
You used the "P" word.

27:15.893 --> 27:17.060
It's like...

27:17.090 --> 27:18.361
Kryptonite.

27:19.695 --> 27:21.267
And I do know you.

27:21.297 --> 27:22.702
Yes, but I know that you would

27:22.732 --> 27:24.962
never let your personal
feelings get in the way.

27:24.992 --> 27:27.356
You are a principled man, Paul Watson.

27:27.386 --> 27:29.272
And now the compliments.

27:29.302 --> 27:30.813
Well, if you don't want to help,

27:30.843 --> 27:33.001
I guess I could just, you know...

27:33.031 --> 27:34.676
take my brother to court.

27:34.706 --> 27:36.868
My family.

27:36.898 --> 27:38.853
[laughing]

27:38.883 --> 27:41.280
And bringing it home with the guilt.

27:41.310 --> 27:43.299
- Nice!
- It beats court.

27:43.329 --> 27:45.181
True.

27:52.929 --> 27:54.033
Cliff!

27:54.242 --> 27:56.226
Wow, I didn't expect to see you.

27:56.256 --> 27:57.185
Peggy.

27:57.215 --> 27:59.574
- What you doing?
- Oh, I just picked up my saddle.

27:59.604 --> 28:00.962
I was thinking about going for a ride.

28:00.992 --> 28:02.287
- Interesting.
- Yeah.

28:02.317 --> 28:05.194
Wow, can't believe I just
ran into you like this.

28:05.224 --> 28:06.665
You didn't.

28:06.695 --> 28:07.780
Excuse me?

28:07.810 --> 28:11.096
You called the ranch, you talked to Cal...

28:11.126 --> 28:13.287
you asked where I was,
then you drove down here.

28:13.317 --> 28:14.313
He called?

28:14.343 --> 28:15.613
Yeah, he texted.

28:15.643 --> 28:17.143
Oh! I'm such a bad liar.

28:18.955 --> 28:20.777
So you wanna tell me
what's going on, Peggy?

28:21.079 --> 28:23.828
It's about Grace and you, cowboy.

28:28.774 --> 28:29.901
Hey!

28:29.931 --> 28:31.782
Derek called. You got me the job?

28:31.812 --> 28:32.946
Yeah.

28:32.976 --> 28:34.316
We needed the help.

28:34.346 --> 28:35.992
Wow. Great.

28:36.275 --> 28:37.709
So crab bins tomorrow?

28:37.739 --> 28:39.249
Yeah, except now you get paid.

28:39.279 --> 28:41.165
Move out of the motel,
find yourself a real place.

28:41.195 --> 28:42.773
I like that motel, all right?

28:42.803 --> 28:44.142
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

28:44.172 --> 28:45.201
It suits my needs.

28:45.231 --> 28:47.152
No wife and kids, so one room works great.

28:47.182 --> 28:48.288
All right.

28:50.615 --> 28:52.426
Hey, this is gonna sound weird, but...

34:16.101 --> 34:18.021
