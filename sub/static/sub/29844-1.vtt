12:49.377 --> 12:50.595
Wait, come on.

12:50.639 --> 12:53.773
Two quinoa salads.

12:55.557 --> 12:58.473
I'm gonna just, uh,
leave the check right here.

12:58.516 --> 13:01.911
-Right. Thank you.
-Let me know if you need a box.

13:03.521 --> 13:05.697
I fucking hate quinoa salad.

13:05.741 --> 13:07.612
Okay.

13:12.748 --> 13:13.923
You're fired.

13:15.620 --> 13:18.058
-Thank you.
-You're really welcome.

13:26.022 --> 13:27.241
That was...

13:27.284 --> 13:30.461
And my people skills
are fucking amazing!

13:35.336 --> 13:39.340
So... you're out of here, huh?

13:39.383 --> 13:41.516
Yeah, I got fired.

13:41.559 --> 13:43.648
Why?

13:43.692 --> 13:45.999
My people skills.

13:47.652 --> 13:50.873
Yeah, I could see that.
I could see that.

13:52.919 --> 13:56.052
-Yep.
-So what are you gonna do?

13:56.096 --> 13:59.926
Are you gonna go out
and, like, find yourself now?

14:01.928 --> 14:03.755
Yes.

14:03.799 --> 14:06.367
Yes, that's exactly
what I'll do.

14:06.410 --> 14:08.673
I'm gonna go find myself.

14:16.333 --> 14:18.292
I have to escort you off
the property now.

14:18.335 --> 14:21.251
Yes. Okay, yep.
That's what you were doing.

14:21.295 --> 14:22.209
I could grab that if you'd like.

14:22.252 --> 14:23.950
No, I got it. I got it.

14:29.781 --> 14:32.219
-Oh, hi.
-Hi.

14:32.262 --> 14:35.135
-Nice boxes.
-Yes. Sorry, yeah. You too.

14:35.178 --> 14:37.615
-Oh, thanks.
-Yeah.

14:37.659 --> 14:39.356
-I'm Jason.
-Mona.

14:39.400 --> 14:41.271
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

14:41.315 --> 14:43.360
-Oh, you're friends with Blake.
-Yeah, I'm just staying

14:43.404 --> 14:45.014
with him for a while.
I'm kinda going through this

14:45.058 --> 14:49.062
-transition thing and...
-Oh. Sounds mysterious.

14:49.105 --> 14:50.802
What about you?
What's this, uh...

14:50.846 --> 14:52.239
-Oh.
-Did you rob a Staples?

14:52.282 --> 14:54.110
-I mean...
-I, um...

14:54.154 --> 14:56.765
-I quit.
-Oh.

14:56.808 --> 14:57.853
I quit my job.

14:57.897 --> 15:00.551
-Um, technically I got fired.
-Oh.

15:00.595 --> 15:03.032
'Cause they said...
they said, "You're fired."

15:03.076 --> 15:07.558
But I... wanted that. So...

15:07.602 --> 15:10.257
Hey. What the fuck
are you doing here?

15:10.300 --> 15:13.477
Oh. Hey, Blake.
Carol kicked me out.

15:13.521 --> 15:16.263
I was wondering if maybe I could
crash or something.

15:16.306 --> 15:20.441
-Uh, of course. Hey, Mona!
-Hey. Nice to meet you.

15:20.484 --> 15:22.747
It's very nice meeting you.
And congratulations.

15:22.791 --> 15:24.836
-And I'm sorry.
-Thanks.

15:24.880 --> 15:26.838
Bummer, yeah. That sucks, huh?

15:26.882 --> 15:29.667
Thank you, man. I just need
to stay for like a few months.

15:29.711 --> 15:31.931
Uh, yeah, I mean come in.

15:31.974 --> 15:33.149
-Let's talk about it.
-Okay.

15:33.193 --> 15:36.936
[air pump whirring]

15:42.854 --> 15:46.728
-You wanna pull this out.
-Oh. Okay.

15:46.771 --> 15:49.296
-Damn it. Thank you.
-Mm-hm.

15:51.559 --> 15:53.039
-All right.
-Good?

15:53.082 --> 15:54.431
I'm gonna get a beer.
You want one?

15:54.475 --> 15:56.390
Uh, sure.

16:03.310 --> 16:05.877
I only have one left.
Splitskies?

16:05.921 --> 16:07.705
-What?
-I only have one left!

16:07.749 --> 16:10.317
-You wanna split it?
-Uh, yeah.

16:10.360 --> 16:12.145
Yeah, that sounds good!

16:13.059 --> 16:14.843
Cool.

16:18.760 --> 16:21.981
-So, what happened?
-Well, you know,

16:22.024 --> 16:24.026
I'm leaving civilization to live
in the wilderness

16:24.070 --> 16:25.549
in three months.
And I guess she just

16:25.593 --> 16:29.423
-couldn't wait that long.
-Good. She was kind of a cunt.

16:29.466 --> 16:32.339
Wait, what?
I thought you two got along.

16:32.382 --> 16:34.297
Uh... I didn't particularly
care for her.

16:34.341 --> 16:36.691
She was bossy and shitty to you.
She was like a first wife

16:36.734 --> 16:38.040
that you, you know,

16:38.084 --> 16:39.563
the implication is you'd
have a second, I guess,

16:39.607 --> 16:40.956
-is what I'm getting at.
-Yeah.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.175
Anyway, good you got
out when you did.

16:42.218 --> 16:44.003
Wow.

16:44.046 --> 16:46.614
You know what you gotta do?

16:46.657 --> 16:48.572
-Oh, here we go.
-You gotta go out...

16:48.616 --> 16:50.226
-Oh, boy.
-...find a girl that looks

16:50.270 --> 16:51.880
like Carol, and then fuck her.

16:51.923 --> 16:53.490
-I'm not going to...
-No, hear me out.

16:53.534 --> 16:55.405
You gotta be mean about it.
You gotta do it for you.

16:55.449 --> 16:56.493
You gotta give her the business.

16:56.537 --> 16:57.842
Get your swagger back.
You feel me?

16:57.886 --> 16:59.496
I don't even know
what that means.

16:59.540 --> 17:01.063
But what are you saying? Like...

17:01.107 --> 17:02.630
not spend the night
or something?

17:02.673 --> 17:04.980
Mm. But do it for you,
know what I mean?

17:05.023 --> 17:06.763
Be mean about it.
Get, like, you know,

17:06.808 --> 17:09.897
-like be the guy, you know?
-Are you sure this is all right?

17:09.941 --> 17:12.727
Me staying here? You sure?

17:12.770 --> 17:15.772
Yeah, I mean, the place looks
a little better already.

17:15.817 --> 17:18.211
You have such OCD, I could
probably fire my cleaning lady.

17:18.253 --> 17:19.167
-So...
-Thanks, man.

17:19.212 --> 17:21.300
-I really appreciate it.
-Yeah.

17:21.344 --> 17:24.391
[sighs]

17:24.434 --> 17:26.871
Man!

17:28.089 --> 17:30.223
All right.

17:31.833 --> 17:33.443
[music plays on laptop]

17:33.487 --> 17:35.315
[man] If you're watching
this video, it's probably

17:35.358 --> 17:36.794
because you're having issues
with either your hiking boots

17:36.838 --> 17:39.319
-or your running shoes...
-What are you doing?

17:39.362 --> 17:41.669
-I'm preparing.
-By watching movies?

17:41.712 --> 17:43.888
No. I'm reading books too.

17:43.932 --> 17:46.543
That's not how you prepare
for this shit, man.

17:46.587 --> 17:47.849
You don't read books.
You gotta train.

17:47.892 --> 17:49.068
You gotta get a trainer,
you gotta do something

17:49.111 --> 17:52.114
-about your body.
-Dude, I have a trainer.

17:52.158 --> 17:53.942
-Who?
-You don't know him.

17:53.985 --> 17:55.726
All right?
He's gonna get me super ripped.

17:55.770 --> 17:59.208
Jesus. You're not gonna
last a week, my friend.

17:59.252 --> 18:01.863
-A cowboy hat?
-Hat means bald.

18:01.906 --> 18:03.691
-You like bald?
-No.

18:03.734 --> 18:06.041
Oh, he's a pilot.
That's cool, right?

18:06.085 --> 18:08.652
Pass. Who doesn't wear a shirt
in their profile picture?

18:08.696 --> 18:10.132
Shirtless guys
have small dicks.

18:10.176 --> 18:12.003
-What?
-How do you know that?

18:12.047 --> 18:14.136
How many data points
do you had?

18:14.180 --> 18:16.965
Uh, one, two... eight.

18:18.053 --> 18:20.664
Pass. Pass.

18:20.708 --> 18:22.144
No, why are you passing so much?

18:22.188 --> 18:24.190
No, I need to say yes more.
I need to be more social.

18:24.233 --> 18:26.409
Oh, don't forget,
they need to be rich.

18:26.453 --> 18:28.498
-Why?
-Fluff and fold laundry.

18:28.542 --> 18:30.239
Takeout dinner every night.

18:30.283 --> 18:31.806
You no longer have a job, Mona.

18:31.849 --> 18:34.069
Unemployment is what, like,
12 weeks?

18:34.113 --> 18:36.027
-Six.
-You don't have a job?

18:36.071 --> 18:37.725
Why aren't we on LinkedIn?

18:37.768 --> 18:40.380
Oh. Oh, God.
It says he's a vampire.

18:40.423 --> 18:43.426
Oh, my God, swipe right!
Swipe right! Do it!

18:43.470 --> 18:45.689
-[laughter]
-You need some hobbies.

18:45.733 --> 18:47.822
-Go where dudes go.
-No, she doesn't like

18:47.865 --> 18:49.650
normal guys.
Hobbies won't work for her.

18:49.693 --> 18:53.393
-That's not true!
-Aw!

18:53.436 --> 18:54.785
-Pass.
-Why?

18:54.829 --> 18:57.092
-No single dads.
-Yeah. No dads.

18:57.136 --> 18:59.399
Why don't you tell us
what you're looking for, Mona.

19:01.183 --> 19:02.489
I don't know.

19:02.532 --> 19:05.100
Someone who is, like, odd,

19:05.144 --> 19:06.971
but not a total freak.

19:07.015 --> 19:10.279
And someone who really knows how
to use Latinate plurals.

19:10.323 --> 19:12.194
That's really important to me.

19:12.238 --> 19:14.196
What are Latinate plurals?

19:14.240 --> 19:17.504
It's just like the appropriate
use of plural nouns.

19:17.547 --> 19:20.115
So, like, cactus, cacti.

19:20.159 --> 19:22.596
Or alumnus, alumni. Or...

19:22.639 --> 19:25.599
-What is she talking about?
-She means like mice and mouse.

19:25.642 --> 19:29.994
No. No. That's not
the right example.

19:30.038 --> 19:32.171
[laughter]

19:32.214 --> 19:33.694
-[indistinct chatter]
-I love him.

19:33.737 --> 19:36.566
-He looks like he's sweet.
-Yes, he does.

19:36.610 --> 19:39.047
-Very sweet.
-I guess I just need

19:39.090 --> 19:42.703
somebody who can
shut my brain off.

19:42.746 --> 19:44.487
I'm training, okay?

19:44.531 --> 19:46.837
I'm training and I'm gonna
get this body in shape

19:46.881 --> 19:48.361
and you'll see. I'll be able
to live in the woods.

19:48.404 --> 19:50.537
Do me a favor. Let me see you
just get out of that bed

19:50.580 --> 19:51.973
in less than three seconds.

19:52.016 --> 19:53.235
I'm not gonna play
your little games.

19:53.279 --> 19:54.236
-All right, get up.
-What?

19:54.280 --> 19:55.455
-Get up. Get up.
-Why?

19:55.498 --> 19:58.240
Let's just see if you're
out of breath.

19:58.284 --> 20:00.199
Sorry. Go ahead.

20:00.242 --> 20:02.679
-Are you gonna push me?
-I'm not gonna push you.

20:06.030 --> 20:08.250
-What?
-You're out of breath.

20:08.294 --> 20:11.775
It's an air mattress, man. Okay?
You get stuck in these things.

20:11.819 --> 20:13.473
What are you doing?

20:20.784 --> 20:23.004
-All right.
-Sh. Listen.

20:23.918 --> 20:25.528
Try it.

20:27.138 --> 20:29.010
-This is ridiculous.
-Just try it.

20:29.053 --> 20:32.753
-Fine.
-And then just be quiet.

20:32.796 --> 20:35.451
-Taking a break? [laughs]
-Just a minute.

20:37.018 --> 20:38.585
[grunts]

20:44.678 --> 20:46.593
[panting]

20:46.636 --> 20:49.422
[laughs] All right.
Do it three times?

20:49.465 --> 20:52.990
[panting]

20:53.034 --> 20:55.166
I mean, come on.

20:55.210 --> 20:57.995
-I'll get you a water.
-Thank you.

21:17.972 --> 21:20.279
[man] What are you doing,
looking to get in shape?

21:24.370 --> 21:28.896
Yeah, I'm gonna go live
off the... off the grid

21:28.939 --> 21:30.985
in Northern California.
I'm writing this book about it.

21:31.028 --> 21:33.117
So I've been doing
a lot of research and,

21:33.161 --> 21:36.991
-you know, reading and...
-You reading books...

21:37.034 --> 21:39.863
to learn how to survive
in the wilderness?

21:39.907 --> 21:42.866
Well, and I'm working out a lot.

21:42.910 --> 21:44.694
Yeah. That won't last a week.

21:44.738 --> 21:47.958
Oh, okay. Thank you.
I appreciate it.

21:48.002 --> 21:50.221
I spent some good time
training up in the hills.

21:50.265 --> 21:53.573
-In Northern California?
-Yeah, with SEAL Team Two.

21:53.616 --> 21:55.531
SEAL Team Two?
Like, the Navy SEALs?

21:55.575 --> 21:57.490
-Yeah.
-You were a Navy SEAL?

21:57.533 --> 22:01.058
Yeah. And I was no
bugout bag either.

22:01.102 --> 22:03.496
-Till the accident.
-Wow.

22:03.539 --> 22:05.759
I lived in the elements!
All of them!

22:05.802 --> 22:09.763
With nothing but
a German army knife and a...

22:09.806 --> 22:12.679
and a... flash of tarp.

22:12.722 --> 22:14.202
What's a German army knife?

22:14.245 --> 22:18.380
It's like a Russian army knife,
only... only way better.

22:18.424 --> 22:20.164
Which is even way better
than a Swiss army knife.

22:20.208 --> 22:22.036
Hey, you don't think
there's any way I could--

22:22.079 --> 22:23.820
Sure, man. I'll train you.

22:23.864 --> 22:27.084
Oh, no. No, I was just thinking
maybe about the knife.

22:27.128 --> 22:30.218
Is your heart in this or not?

22:30.261 --> 22:32.002
Yeah, my heart is in it.

22:32.046 --> 22:34.657
You want to die out there.

22:34.701 --> 22:38.400
Good luck, man. That's cool.
Really, good luck.

22:40.271 --> 22:41.925
Goddamn it.

22:41.969 --> 22:45.189
Come back, please. All right.

22:45.233 --> 22:47.409
All right.

22:47.453 --> 22:50.499
Fine. You know what?
Fuck it. I'm in.

22:51.239 --> 22:52.806
Good. Good.

22:52.849 --> 22:54.198
I need your phone number.

22:54.242 --> 22:56.157
'Cause I need to be able
to reach you day or night.

22:56.200 --> 22:57.767
24 hours.

22:59.943 --> 23:01.467
All right. Well,
do you have a pen?

23:02.468 --> 23:04.165
I got mascara.

23:23.489 --> 23:26.143
Um...

23:26.187 --> 23:27.710
I think that's two loads.

23:27.754 --> 23:30.060
Oh.

23:30.104 --> 23:33.281
It's been a while
since I've done laundry.

23:33.324 --> 23:36.806
Okay, well, all right.
Let me help you then.

23:36.850 --> 23:41.332
First off, you have a lot of
colors and whites mixed in here.

23:41.376 --> 23:43.770
And that is not a good thing.

23:43.813 --> 23:46.337
I think it's okay.

23:46.381 --> 23:48.427
-Okay.
-[both laugh]

23:48.470 --> 23:52.431
-I love all colors.
-[laughs]

23:54.607 --> 23:57.044
-Thank you for your help.
-Sure.

36:41.111 --> 36:43.549
Ugh! Well, the 40-hour work week
is so immoral.

36:43.592 --> 36:47.683

That's like a vacation.

36:47.727 --> 36:49.250

in my filing cabinet.

-You gotta pay the bills.

36:52.862 --> 36:55.952

to pay the bills.

36:55.996 --> 36:58.259
What? Is that what this is?

36:58.303 --> 37:01.436

for Scientology or something?

Or is it Mary Kay? Please don't
tell me it's Mary Kay.

37:03.482 --> 37:07.137
No! No, it's, actually,
it's a little too complicated

37:07.181 --> 37:08.878
to explain in one night. So...

37:08.922 --> 37:11.881
I'm good at getting things.

37:11.925 --> 37:17.539
Okay. Um, well, I am gonna be
going off and...

37:17.583 --> 37:20.368
I'm gonna live in the mountains
for a while.

That's not complicated.
That's pretty awesome.

pretty taxing?

Well, you know, my dad used
to go all the time.

37:31.553 --> 37:34.208
And, uh, he would take me
a few times.

37:34.252 --> 37:37.298
You know, we would go up
into the woods,

37:37.342 --> 37:41.171
and, uh, sleep in tents
and he'd crack open a beer

37:41.215 --> 37:44.523
and sneak me some sips.

37:44.566 --> 37:47.787
-Where's your dad now?
-Uh, he passed.

37:47.830 --> 37:50.006
-I'm sorry.
-Yeah.

of him.

-Wow. Very handsome.

I get it from.

a journal

38:06.893 --> 38:08.329

about it.

38:08.373 --> 38:10.897
Wow! That's intense.

38:10.940 --> 38:12.638
Literally, 'cause you'll be
in a tent.

-Right here.

I can do it.

-Yeah.

40:46.356 --> 40:48.750
Yeah, well, you know,
I could usually make a fire

40:48.794 --> 40:51.666
using local materials, but this
is for rain emergencies.

40:51.710 --> 40:54.321
Sure. Where are you headed?

40:54.364 --> 40:57.977
North. The Sierra region.
You know, around those parts.

40:58.020 --> 41:00.370
Sierras are so pretty.
Me and some of the crew here

50:10.920 --> 50:12.574
It's just breakfast.

50:13.749 --> 50:16.926
-You okay?
-I'm fine. Yeah.

50:16.970 --> 50:19.103
Okay.

50:20.887 --> 50:24.151
I heard Blake
fuck this girl yesterday.

50:24.195 --> 50:28.286
Uh, yeah, well...

50:28.329 --> 50:30.331
That was actually,
that was me.

50:30.375 --> 50:32.072
You fucked Blake?

50:32.116 --> 50:35.075
[laughs] No, um,
my ex showed up.

50:35.119 --> 50:38.774
And it was kind of like
a goodbye thing, I think.

50:38.818 --> 50:42.648
-Oh.
-Yeah.

50:42.691 --> 50:45.868
Is that what you
wanted to tell me?

50:45.912 --> 50:50.221
Well, I was gonna tell you
I tried DMT, you know?

50:50.264 --> 50:52.875
-And I saw my truth.
-Wait, wait.

50:52.919 --> 50:55.269
You fucked your ex-girlfriend

50:55.313 --> 50:58.664
and you weren't
gonna tell me?

51:00.057 --> 51:04.235
-Mona, I was gonna tell you.
-Yeah.

51:04.278 --> 51:07.803
Listen, I told you that
I wasn't looking for anything.

51:07.847 --> 51:09.936
-Okay?
-I remember.

51:17.944 --> 51:19.772
Come on, man, you hesitate
for a second

51:19.815 --> 51:22.470
in nature and you're dead!
Dead!

51:22.514 --> 51:24.864
Damn it!
Maybe it's the kindling.

51:24.907 --> 51:28.650
-Maybe it's the wrong stuff.
-The kindling's not weak.

51:28.694 --> 51:31.740
It's your spirit, man!
Your spirit!

51:39.052 --> 51:41.185
It's not the kindling, is it?

51:41.228 --> 51:44.318
I don't know, man.

51:44.362 --> 51:46.146
All right, no one bit.

51:46.190 --> 51:47.930
Which means there's no book.

51:47.974 --> 51:50.411
Which means there's no odyssey.

51:52.718 --> 51:55.155
I get it.

51:55.199 --> 51:57.984
You're gonna let the approval

51:58.027 --> 52:01.814
of some shitty-ass
publishing company

52:01.857 --> 52:06.340
get between you
and fucking nature.

52:10.170 --> 52:12.825
No, it's not...

52:12.868 --> 52:15.262
It's different.

52:15.306 --> 52:18.178
Michelangelo needed a ceiling.

52:18.222 --> 52:21.355
The Beatles needed
a record deal.

52:21.399 --> 52:23.836
You want to live
in the wilderness.

52:23.879 --> 52:26.839
You don't need shit.

52:28.232 --> 52:30.364
Oh!

52:31.365 --> 52:32.932
Oh!

52:33.976 --> 52:35.500
Come on!

52:39.895 --> 52:41.593
Oh!

52:47.251 --> 52:51.037
Okay. Come on. Come on.
You got this.

52:51.080 --> 52:52.865
Come on.

52:52.908 --> 52:55.650
All right, just...

52:57.217 --> 52:58.827
Tight...

53:08.185 --> 53:12.885
Expired? I had 0 percent
APR for years!

53:12.928 --> 53:15.192
I'm a good customer!

53:15.235 --> 53:17.933
I was late for one day,
and I'm punished?

53:17.977 --> 53:20.240
Can I speak to your supervisor
or your manager or somebody?

53:20.284 --> 53:23.374
-Literally anybody else but you.
-[knock on door]

53:23.417 --> 53:25.071
No, don't put me on hold.

53:25.114 --> 53:27.769
No, just leave me on the phone
and then you go get somebody.

53:27.813 --> 53:30.424
Hello? Fuck!

53:30.468 --> 53:32.034
[music plays on phone]

53:32.078 --> 53:34.689
-What?
-What? Excuse me.

53:34.733 --> 53:37.779
I just wanted to know
if you wanted to dance.

53:38.780 --> 53:40.260
Opa!

53:40.304 --> 53:42.131
Leave me alone.

53:42.175 --> 53:43.872
All right, look.

53:43.916 --> 53:47.006
I'm sorry! All right? I'm sorry
if I hurt your feelings.

53:47.049 --> 53:51.140
I really am. But, look,
I miss hanging out with you.

53:51.184 --> 53:52.794
I do.

53:52.838 --> 53:55.971
And I think that the two of us
should hang out and spend some

53:56.015 --> 53:58.278
time together before I go
off into the wilderness

53:58.322 --> 54:00.411
and cut off all human contact.

54:00.454 --> 54:02.195
So, please.

54:02.239 --> 54:04.980
Can't you just hang out with me?
Spin.

54:05.024 --> 54:06.721
Look at that.

54:07.983 --> 54:09.594
-Is that a smile?
-No.

54:09.637 --> 54:11.030
-Is she smiling?
-No.

54:11.073 --> 54:13.424
Oh, my God!
The witch isn't dead!

54:13.467 --> 54:17.515
[chuckles] So, um...

54:17.558 --> 54:21.388
-How's life?
-Well, I'm broke.

54:21.432 --> 54:24.609
And I don't even know
what bills I need to pay.

54:24.652 --> 54:27.829
-And I live like this now.
-[line rings]

54:27.873 --> 54:29.048
-[woman] Hello, Miss Harris.
-Oh.

54:29.091 --> 54:31.616
Oh, just let me coach you
through this.

54:31.659 --> 54:32.791
-Fine.
-No, all right?

54:32.834 --> 54:35.446
Now, ask how she's doing.
How you doing?

54:35.489 --> 54:39.058
How are you doing?
Is your day good?

54:39.101 --> 54:42.888
It's okay, you know, but at
least the weather is good.

54:42.931 --> 54:44.759
-Where is she?
-Where are you?

54:44.803 --> 54:46.979
-Where's your call center?
-Kentucky.

54:47.022 --> 54:49.547
Kentucky. You love Kentucky.
Exaggerate.

54:49.590 --> 54:53.812
Oh, I love Kentucky. Yeah.
It's great. It's so... vast.

54:53.855 --> 54:57.468
And there's lots of planes
and...

54:57.511 --> 54:59.557
-[Jason whispering]
-...the great university.

54:59.600 --> 55:02.516
Lots of libraries.
And ooh, Wildcats, go!

55:02.560 --> 55:06.215
I like it too. So how can
I help you, Miss Harris?

55:06.259 --> 55:07.347
You know this
isn't your problem.

55:07.391 --> 55:09.480
Okay, I know this
isn't your problem.

55:09.523 --> 55:13.484
-I know it's a headache.
-And I know it's a headache.

55:13.527 --> 55:16.008
Is there any way
that you can help me?

55:16.051 --> 55:19.403
Is there any way you can help
me with my APR situation?

55:19.446 --> 55:21.709
-Please.
-Please?

55:25.104 --> 55:28.977
I guess just this one time.

55:29.021 --> 55:30.936
Great! Thank you.

55:30.979 --> 55:34.113
-Can I put you on hold?
-Yeah. Sure.

55:34.156 --> 55:37.029
-How did you do that?
-I owe a lot of money

55:37.072 --> 55:39.553
-to many different places.
-[laughs]

55:39.597 --> 55:42.817
Well, for someone who's gonna
be alone in the wilderness,

55:42.861 --> 55:44.863
you're really good with people.

55:44.906 --> 55:47.735
So, what do you say, huh?

55:47.779 --> 55:50.738
Let's hang out again.
You know, we can go to dinner.

55:50.782 --> 55:53.393
I could show you that dance
move. It's very easy.

55:53.437 --> 55:55.352
Or you could teach me
to dance.

55:55.395 --> 55:58.877
Um... uh, yeah.

55:58.920 --> 56:00.444
Yeah, we can, um...

56:00.487 --> 56:04.883
I have a pre-Christmas dinner
party that I'm gonna have.

56:06.537 --> 56:09.409
All right.
What about this one?

56:09.453 --> 56:11.498
[Mona] Sure. What is it?

56:11.542 --> 56:14.849
-It is a, um...
-It's fine. Open it. It's wine.

56:14.893 --> 56:16.242
All right.

56:16.285 --> 56:17.809
Why don't you like him?

56:17.852 --> 56:21.856
He cheated on her!
He had sex with his ex.

56:21.900 --> 56:24.206
Mona said they weren't
together when that happened.

56:24.250 --> 56:27.427
Look, having a boyfriend,
healthy.

56:27.471 --> 56:30.517
Fucking random guys for fun
is healthy.

56:30.561 --> 56:34.434
But what she's doing?
This shit, that's not healthy.

56:34.478 --> 56:37.306
I don't think having sex with
random guys is that healthy.

56:37.350 --> 56:40.266
No, see, that's bullshit. Why is
it to be a feminist right now

56:40.309 --> 56:42.790
you have to completely
desexualize?

56:42.834 --> 56:44.749
Sometimes, I like dressing hot.

56:44.792 --> 56:46.881
Sometimes, I like having men
look at me.

56:46.925 --> 56:49.144
And you know what?
I actually like my thigh-gap.

56:49.188 --> 56:50.624
I think it's sexy.

56:50.668 --> 56:54.062
So I'm just what, like,
persona non grata at HuffPo?

56:54.106 --> 56:56.151
Hashtag women against feminism.

56:58.023 --> 57:00.634
An odyssey, right?
Why an odyssey?

57:00.678 --> 57:03.463
Well, it's a voyage.

57:03.507 --> 57:07.424
Really, kind of a
self-exploration.

57:07.467 --> 57:09.121
It's not that I'm anti-feminist.

57:09.164 --> 57:11.732
It's just that I like to stand
for things that try

57:11.776 --> 57:13.995
to push me out
of the feminism movement.

57:14.039 --> 57:17.172
Blake-- it's Blake, right?
What's your perspective on this?

57:17.216 --> 57:19.610
No, no, don't ask him. He's
just gonna say something stupid,

57:19.653 --> 57:21.046
like, "Women be crazy,"
or whatever.

57:21.089 --> 57:24.745
So in The Odyssey,
Odysseus was trying to find

57:24.789 --> 57:26.443
his way back home.

57:26.486 --> 57:28.836
But you, you're leaving home
to go live in the woods.

57:28.880 --> 57:32.492
And then you're coming back.
So that's not an odyssey.

57:32.536 --> 57:34.407
Well, it's an internal odyssey.

57:34.451 --> 57:36.540
I always felt that
fourth wave feminism

57:36.583 --> 57:38.150
was seizing an equal seat
at the table

57:38.193 --> 57:40.674
without rejecting
femininity entirely.

57:40.718 --> 57:44.939
I mean, Marissa Mayer. She's
wearing heels to work, right?

57:44.983 --> 57:47.507
What about Tina Fey?
She does an AmEx commercial

57:47.551 --> 57:49.466
and then she does
a Garnier commercial.

57:49.509 --> 57:51.946
I don't know. I mean,
I feel like it's kinda hard

57:51.990 --> 57:53.948
for me to chime in on this.
How can I empathize

57:53.992 --> 57:56.255
with a woman if I'm just a man,
but...?

57:56.298 --> 57:59.214
Then again,
that's what empathy is, huh?

57:59.258 --> 58:01.565
[chuckles] I don't know,
it's stupid.

58:01.608 --> 58:03.262
I'm gonna get a refill.
You girls want some Sav Blanc?

58:03.305 --> 58:05.525
-Sure.
-Sure.

58:07.222 --> 58:08.702
Why don't you call it
Walden Pond.

58:08.746 --> 58:11.400
-Fuck, Into the Wild.
-Okay, Krakauer was a poser.

58:11.444 --> 58:13.185
And a liar,
to be honest with you.

58:13.228 --> 58:15.143
-So I--
-Okay. All right.

58:15.187 --> 58:16.405
This isn't about Krakauer.

58:16.449 --> 58:17.711
This is about
your pretentious experiment.

58:17.755 --> 58:21.541
-Pretentious? [scoffs]
-A little.

58:21.585 --> 58:24.501
Who's publishing this?

58:24.544 --> 58:25.850
What was-- what'd you ask?

58:26.764 --> 58:28.722
-[Mona] Okay.
-Oh!

58:28.766 --> 58:31.159
We've got turkey,
mac and cheese,

58:31.203 --> 58:33.945
-salad, green beans...
-Let me help you.

58:33.988 --> 58:35.903
-Lots of stuff.
-This looks fantastic.

58:35.947 --> 58:38.645
-Thank you.
-Awesome.

58:38.689 --> 58:42.388
Put that there.
I will take the mac and cheese.

58:42.431 --> 58:44.564
-This looks amazing.
-[Mona] Thank you.

58:44.608 --> 58:46.610
Congratulations.
People don't say that enough

58:46.653 --> 58:48.786
when it comes to food.
Congratulations.

58:48.829 --> 58:50.527
-[Mona] Thanks.
-Getting the wine going.

58:50.570 --> 58:54.487
-[doorbell buzzes]
-Who is that?

58:54.531 --> 58:59.231
-It's probably Gerard.
-Who?

59:00.145 --> 59:02.582
Gerard, your mentor.

59:02.626 --> 59:05.063
-I invited him.
-[laughs]

59:05.106 --> 59:07.718
-Uh, why?
-Why not?

59:07.761 --> 59:10.416
He's, um, Jason's mentor.

59:10.459 --> 59:15.203
Don't you want to introduce
everybody to your mentor, Jason?

59:15.247 --> 59:17.510
-[doorbell buzzes]
-It's just,

59:17.554 --> 59:19.077
I don't know
if we have enough food.

59:19.120 --> 59:20.774
-You know, I didn't wanna...
-[Jen] Are you kidding?

59:20.818 --> 59:23.168
There's gonna be
leftovers for weeks.

59:23.211 --> 59:24.517
-[Blake] Plenty of food.
-[Jason] Okay.

59:24.561 --> 59:25.823
Then I guess I'll go get him.
I'll go get...

59:25.866 --> 59:28.260
-[doorbell buzzes]
-I'll go get Gerard.

59:29.522 --> 59:32.917
Sorry. Oh. It's all right. Okay.

59:44.232 --> 59:46.495
Gerard, it's so nice
to finally meet you.

59:46.539 --> 59:48.236
I feel like Jason's
been hiding you.

59:48.280 --> 59:49.977
I know. How did you guys
even meet, anyway?

59:50.021 --> 59:51.457
I've never had a mentor.

59:51.500 --> 59:53.764
Believe it or not,
we met at the bus stop.

59:53.807 --> 59:57.724
Yeah, he told me
about his project. His odyssey.

59:57.768 --> 01:00:01.336
I was a SEAL, so I offered
to help him prepare.

01:00:01.380 --> 01:00:04.078
-Mm-hm.
-[Jen] That's so cool.

01:00:04.122 --> 01:00:05.602
[Gerard] Mona,
this turkey is delicious.

01:00:05.645 --> 01:00:09.257
Oh, thank you.
I like your... pie?

01:00:09.301 --> 01:00:13.174
-Meat pie. Did you try it?
-Mm. Mm-hm. It's delicious.

01:00:13.218 --> 01:00:14.698
It's so mild.

01:00:14.741 --> 01:00:17.352
I can't stand how people
over-salt food today.

01:00:17.396 --> 01:00:19.616
Gerard, do you have any kids?

01:00:20.312 --> 01:00:21.661
Yeah.

01:00:21.705 --> 01:00:22.575
I have nine children.

01:00:22.619 --> 01:00:24.533
-Oh, my God!
-Nine! Wow!

01:00:24.577 --> 01:00:26.448
Two of them died.

01:00:26.492 --> 01:00:29.669
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I really had no idea.

01:00:29.713 --> 01:00:31.584
[Gerard] I'm batting a .820.

01:00:31.628 --> 01:00:34.848
-It's actually .777.
-Really? Mona...

01:00:34.892 --> 01:00:37.024
-.778.
-Can I get a little more

01:00:37.068 --> 01:00:40.332
of the pie, please?
I cannot stop eating this.

01:00:40.375 --> 01:00:42.247
Seriously, I'm going
to put this on my blog.

01:00:42.290 --> 01:00:45.337
-Where do you live?
-I live under a bridge

01:00:45.380 --> 01:00:47.731
across the street.

01:00:49.254 --> 01:00:50.864
Don't you guys think
we should move to dessert?

01:00:50.908 --> 01:00:52.518
-I think...
-I would actually...

01:00:52.561 --> 01:00:53.606

01:13:36.586 --> 01:13:39.415
You're a nice guy.

01:13:39.458 --> 01:13:41.329
You're my friend.

01:13:42.505 --> 01:13:45.551
And I'm scared for you.

01:13:45.595 --> 01:13:47.814
Look, if you wanna live
a normal fucking life

01:13:47.858 --> 01:13:49.903
and have two and a half babies
and get a job,

01:13:49.947 --> 01:13:52.166
I'll never make fun of you.
I promise, ever.

01:13:52.210 --> 01:13:54.473
I won't say a fucking word.
You can stay on my couch

01:13:54.517 --> 01:13:56.910
until you figure out whatever
this bullshit is that you need.

01:13:56.954 --> 01:13:58.651
And I will never say anything.

01:14:01.132 --> 01:14:04.048
Do you think I'll last
more than a week?

01:14:06.006 --> 01:14:07.704
Yeah.

01:14:11.403 --> 01:14:13.884
Okay, I wanna go now.

01:14:26.157 --> 01:14:28.289
You hungry?

01:14:31.118 --> 01:14:32.990
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

01:14:33.033 --> 01:14:34.687
I could eat.

01:14:34.731 --> 01:14:37.211
I want...
I don't care what it is,

01:14:37.255 --> 01:14:39.997
but I want something
like this...

01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:42.390
I know exactly what I want.
I don't-- I just want--

01:14:42.434 --> 01:14:44.218
I want Mexican.

01:14:45.568 --> 01:14:47.265
Me too.

01:14:54.533 --> 01:14:57.318
Come with me.

01:14:57.362 --> 01:14:58.842
What?

01:14:58.885 --> 01:15:01.018
On the odyssey.

01:15:01.061 --> 01:15:03.847
-Come with me.
-[laughs]

01:15:07.546 --> 01:15:09.722
I love you.

01:15:12.029 --> 01:15:14.771
You don't have to do a thing.

01:15:14.814 --> 01:15:17.556
I'll cook, I'll catch the food.

01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:20.690
I'll pitch the tent.
I'll start the fire.

01:15:20.733 --> 01:15:22.474
I'm ready for this.

01:15:23.431 --> 01:15:27.218
Um, but won't that...

01:15:27.261 --> 01:15:29.394
defeat the purpose
of being alone?

01:15:31.962 --> 01:15:33.833
[sighs]

01:15:37.358 --> 01:15:39.186
I love you too.

01:15:42.494 --> 01:15:44.583
Come with me.

All right. Well, the first
few days were cake.

01:19:54.137 --> 01:19:58.141
I gathered berries,
I trapped a rabbit.

01:19:58.184 --> 01:20:00.839
I made a fire.

01:20:00.883 --> 01:20:02.145
The first night
it was actually kind of warm,

01:20:02.188 --> 01:20:04.495
so I just pulled
a sleeping bag out

01:20:04.538 --> 01:20:07.280
and slept under the stars.

01:20:07.324 --> 01:20:08.804
In the daytime,
I didn't do much.

01:20:08.847 --> 01:20:10.806
I walked around.

01:20:10.849 --> 01:20:11.763
Read books.

01:20:11.807 --> 01:20:14.635
Checked the traps.

01:20:14.679 --> 01:20:17.203
Everything was kind of
going to plan.

01:20:18.291 --> 01:20:20.250
And it was so beautiful.

01:20:20.293 --> 01:20:22.861
It was very beautiful.

01:20:26.691 --> 01:20:29.259
And so boring.
It was so boring.

01:20:29.302 --> 01:20:30.782
I mean, boring.

01:20:30.826 --> 01:20:33.263
And it rained.
It just fucking rained.

01:20:33.306 --> 01:20:36.570
It would not stop raining.
It was freezing as shit.

01:20:36.614 --> 01:20:38.094
Then I got diarrhea.

01:20:38.137 --> 01:20:40.705
Then after a few days,
this vulture landed

01:20:40.748 --> 01:20:43.577
by the camp and started
staring at me.

01:20:43.621 --> 01:20:45.405
So I tried to shoo him away.

01:20:45.449 --> 01:20:47.233
Then the next day I woke up
and there were two of them.

01:20:47.277 --> 01:20:50.106
And then five,
and I lost it.

01:20:50.149 --> 01:20:52.499
I just... that was that.

01:20:52.543 --> 01:20:56.416
I failed.
Just not Dad.

01:21:01.247 --> 01:21:02.509
-What?
-You are nothing

01:21:02.553 --> 01:21:05.382
like your father!
And that is a good thing.

01:21:05.425 --> 01:21:06.513
He was a man's man.

01:21:06.557 --> 01:21:08.472
What? Really?

01:21:08.515 --> 01:21:09.908
Is that what you think?

01:21:09.952 --> 01:21:11.997
I mean, what--
please explain this to me.

01:21:12.041 --> 01:21:13.781
I want to hear it.

01:21:13.825 --> 01:21:15.261
Okay. He was stoic. All right?

01:21:15.305 --> 01:21:17.873
He was self-reliant.

01:21:17.916 --> 01:21:21.354
-He could make fires, he--
-He used to leave us alone

01:21:21.398 --> 01:21:23.574
so he could go
fuck around in the woods.

01:21:23.617 --> 01:21:26.925
He could live on his own,
he was self-sufficient.

01:21:26.969 --> 01:21:30.494
He would drive to a
campground, meet his buddies,

01:21:30.537 --> 01:21:33.627
and they would drink beer
and shoot guns.

01:21:35.803 --> 01:21:39.068
-Look at me.
-[sighs]

01:21:41.984 --> 01:21:44.943
This wilderness thing?

01:21:44.987 --> 01:21:49.339
I think it's about time
you fucking failed.

01:21:49.382 --> 01:21:52.646
-I fail all the time.
-No, you quit.

01:21:52.690 --> 01:21:56.955
You quit before you learn things
about yourself.

01:21:56.999 --> 01:21:58.914
You play it safe.

01:21:58.957 --> 01:22:02.352
But this time,
you put it all out there.

01:22:02.395 --> 01:22:05.311
You put all your chips
on the table.

01:22:07.357 --> 01:22:09.489
How long did you stay out there?

01:22:11.013 --> 01:22:13.319
-Eight days.
-Eight days!

01:22:13.363 --> 01:22:15.408
That is huge!

01:22:15.452 --> 01:22:17.584
Good job, Jay!

01:22:17.628 --> 01:22:20.805
There it is! There it is.
A smile.

01:22:20.848 --> 01:22:23.460
-Okay.
-A smile. [laughs]

01:22:23.503 --> 01:22:26.898
-Mom of the year.
-Yeah.

01:22:27.725 --> 01:22:29.727
You fail.

01:22:29.770 --> 01:22:32.469
And then you move on,
and you learn from that.

01:22:32.512 --> 01:22:35.037
And you fail again.

01:22:35.080 --> 01:22:36.995
But maybe you should
start thinking about

01:22:37.039 --> 01:22:39.215
what you're gonna fail at next.

01:22:49.573 --> 01:22:51.096
[Mona] The figures are right.

01:22:51.140 --> 01:22:52.619
I've run the numbers
a dozen times.

01:22:52.663 --> 01:22:55.013
The numbers don't matter
until the client signs off,

01:22:55.057 --> 01:22:58.321
and if they don't commit...
You know, you always do this.

01:22:58.364 --> 01:23:00.671
You always get hung up
on numbers--

01:23:00.714 --> 01:23:01.715
-Steve.
-Yes?

01:23:01.759 --> 01:23:03.282
-We're a team.
-I know.

01:23:03.326 --> 01:23:07.025
And I would like it if you can
trust me with the numbers.

01:23:07.069 --> 01:23:08.548
I'm great at numbers.

01:23:08.592 --> 01:23:11.247
You're great at making
beautiful presentations.

01:23:11.290 --> 01:23:14.598
You're like
the Da Vinci of PowerPoint.

01:23:14.641 --> 01:23:18.558
So what I would like is if you
could put these numbers

01:23:18.602 --> 01:23:20.430
into the greatest presentation

01:23:20.473 --> 01:23:23.128
that corporate America
has ever seen.

01:23:23.172 --> 01:23:24.303
Can we do that?

01:23:27.437 --> 01:23:30.918
[Steve] Yeah...
What the fuck?

01:23:30.962 --> 01:23:33.399
-Mona!
-Oh.

01:23:33.443 --> 01:23:35.488
-[Jason laughs]
-Oh!

01:23:37.273 --> 01:23:38.404
Let's take a five.

01:23:38.448 --> 01:23:40.972
Okay! All right!

01:23:41.016 --> 01:23:43.496
-What are you doing here?
-You know this dude?

01:23:43.540 --> 01:23:45.237
Kind of. Speak.

01:23:45.281 --> 01:23:46.891
Fine, all right. Okay.

01:23:46.934 --> 01:23:49.459
Look, Mona, I...

01:23:49.502 --> 01:23:51.374
I was not meant
to live in the wilderness.

01:23:51.417 --> 01:23:52.940
-Okay?
-Obviously.

01:23:52.984 --> 01:23:54.551
What does that
have to do with me?

01:23:54.594 --> 01:23:58.076
Look, my whole life, I have
tried to live up to my father

01:23:58.120 --> 01:24:00.687
because he is a man's man.
Okay?

01:24:00.731 --> 01:24:04.213
All right? I get that.
And I had this idea in my head

01:24:04.256 --> 01:24:05.344
that I had to live that way

01:24:05.388 --> 01:24:07.477
because that's how
a man should live.

01:24:07.520 --> 01:24:11.394
But it turns out that my father,
he's a lie, too!

01:24:11.437 --> 01:24:13.613
And I'm sick of it.
I don't want to live in a lie.

01:24:13.657 --> 01:24:16.225
So here it goes.

01:24:16.268 --> 01:24:19.054
Hi. I'm Jason.

01:24:19.097 --> 01:24:21.317
Okay! All right.

01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:24.189
I'm Jason,
and I like being indoors.

01:24:24.233 --> 01:24:27.366
Okay? I like being indoors
and watching documentaries

01:24:27.410 --> 01:24:30.456
and reading books.
And I like to smoke pot...

01:24:30.500 --> 01:24:33.807
I like to smoke pot
and I like to make people smile.

01:24:33.851 --> 01:24:38.769
I like to make you smile,
Mona, because I like you a lot.

01:24:38.812 --> 01:24:41.293
Don't-- I see it right there.
Right in your face!

01:24:41.337 --> 01:24:43.426
I can see it!
Look at you!

01:24:43.469 --> 01:24:45.689
You're trying to plot this out
on the graph of your life.

01:24:45.732 --> 01:24:47.647
You're trying
to see if this datum

01:24:47.691 --> 01:24:50.911
makes any sense or reason.

01:24:50.955 --> 01:24:53.479
What did you say?

01:24:53.523 --> 01:24:56.308
I was just trying
to explain that...

01:24:56.352 --> 01:24:57.353
I help you shut off your brain.

01:24:57.396 --> 01:25:00.051
No, before that.
You said "datum."

01:25:00.095 --> 01:25:05.100
Yeah, datum.
You know, the singular of data.

01:25:05.143 --> 01:25:07.014
I hate when people
get that wrong.

01:25:07.058 --> 01:25:09.930
Yeah. Me too.

01:25:12.498 --> 01:25:14.979
-You sure?
-Yeah.

01:25:17.547 --> 01:25:20.506
♪

01:25:42.311 --> 01:25:44.008
That one's not too bad,
actually.

01:25:44.051 --> 01:25:46.358
You know? The bottle opener
is a little hard to get at,

01:25:46.402 --> 01:25:48.186
but the blade never gets dull.

01:25:48.230 --> 01:25:52.582
Oh, great. That's nice.
And how about that red one?

01:25:52.625 --> 01:25:56.063
-That one is shit.
-Poop. Okay.

01:25:56.107 --> 01:25:58.109
Well, oh,
and what about this one?

01:25:58.153 --> 01:26:00.285
The Transformer looking one?
Star Wars.

01:26:00.329 --> 01:26:01.504
-Yeah.
-I like your taste.

01:26:01.547 --> 01:26:03.332
That's a good one.
This one's expensive,

01:26:03.375 --> 01:26:05.812
but it's awesome, dude.
This is the one I have.

01:26:05.856 --> 01:26:07.162
-Oh.
-Yeah.

01:26:07.205 --> 01:26:09.381
And you're a camper, right?
I mean, obviously.

01:26:09.425 --> 01:26:10.774
-Oh, yeah.
-You go camping a lot?

01:26:10.817 --> 01:26:12.993
Well, I don't like
to tell this story,

01:26:13.037 --> 01:26:17.955
but, you know, I spent a week
living in the wilderness.

01:26:17.998 --> 01:26:19.870
-A week? Oh...
-Mm-hm.

01:26:19.913 --> 01:26:22.525
Like... like seven days?

01:26:22.568 --> 01:26:27.747
-Like just...
-A week and then six months.

01:26:27.791 --> 01:26:29.619
-In the wilderness.
-What?

01:26:29.662 --> 01:26:30.837
Alone.

01:26:30.881 --> 01:26:34.450
Me, my thoughts, my journal.

01:26:35.494 --> 01:26:37.757
-This.
