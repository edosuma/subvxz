00:12.278 --> 00:13.745
Go!

00:21.888 --> 00:23.617
Go, boy! Hyah!

00:32.131 --> 00:34.794
Hyah! Heh! Heh, hyah! Heh!

00:49.182 --> 00:50.274
Hyah! Come on!

01:22.515 --> 01:24.710
Whoa.

01:24.818 --> 01:27.184
- Whoa.
- Hold up, boys.

01:27.287 --> 01:29.255
They ain't worth it, boss.

01:31.958 --> 01:33.926
Let's go back.

01:40.266 --> 01:42.200
Hyah!

01:44.571 --> 01:46.334
Looks like they gave up.

01:46.439 --> 01:48.031
I'm getting real tired of this, Daniel.

01:48.141 --> 01:49.403
Yeah, they were plenty mad...

01:49.509 --> 01:51.306
when I beat the big boy in arm wrestling.

01:51.411 --> 01:54.141
One day that temper and big mouth of yours
is gonna get you in deep trouble.

01:54.247 --> 01:56.147
Haven't made the trouble
I can't get out of.

01:56.249 --> 01:57.944
We've run these horses long enough.

01:58.051 --> 01:59.814
We'll set up camp about a mile or two.

01:59.919 --> 02:01.716
Hyah. Hyah.

02:13.199 --> 02:15.360
One dozen eggs, fresh as they come.

02:16.936 --> 02:19.632
Thank you, Mrs. Evans.

02:32.952 --> 02:37.321
- Hello, Ellen.
- Sheriff Holden. What brings you out here?

02:37.423 --> 02:40.392
Making my rounds.
Thought I'd look in on you and Cassie.

02:40.493 --> 02:43.462
We're fine.
Would you like some cool water?

02:43.563 --> 02:45.588
No, I've still got ground to cover.

02:45.698 --> 02:47.791
Looks like some repairs are in order.

02:47.901 --> 02:50.893
We'll get to them.
I still don't need any hired help.

02:51.004 --> 02:53.768
- Good enough.
- Your visits are always welcome.

02:53.873 --> 02:56.899
Elbow's been throbbing some.
Looks like a storm's blowing in.

02:58.311 --> 03:00.802
Really?
It's awfully sunny, Sheriff.

03:00.914 --> 03:02.404
Elbow never lies.

03:02.515 --> 03:03.812
Could be a doozy.

03:03.917 --> 03:05.441
I'd batten down the hatches.

03:05.552 --> 03:08.316
Hyah. Hyah.

03:18.598 --> 03:20.793
So what are you cooking up for supper?

03:20.900 --> 03:24.267
There's plenty of game around here.
Why don't you get off your duff and go check the menu?

03:24.370 --> 03:26.463
The California hills are filled with gold.

03:26.573 --> 03:29.906
When we hit our big strike,
I'm gonna take my gold up to Oregon...

03:30.009 --> 03:33.240
buy myself a ranch
the size of Delaware, huh?

03:34.948 --> 03:37.348
Find me a pretty little wife,
start a family.

03:38.551 --> 03:40.280
What about you?

03:40.386 --> 03:44.482
Think I'll catch one of them steamers out
of San Francisco, head on up to China.

03:44.591 --> 03:47.583
China? What's in China?

03:47.694 --> 03:49.924
I've always wanted to see
that great big wall of theirs.

03:50.029 --> 03:51.394
And after that, who knows?

03:53.199 --> 03:56.293
You gonna go hunting,
or I gotta do everything?

03:56.402 --> 03:59.428
- You know, you sound like my ma.
- Best we built a shelter.

03:59.539 --> 04:02.303
You know, you're always looking out for me,
like a mother hen.

04:02.408 --> 04:04.069
Yeah, well, somebody got to.

04:05.411 --> 04:06.844
You do what you want.

04:06.946 --> 04:08.937
I'll be fine sleeping under the stars.

04:09.048 --> 04:13.007
And when we strike it rich, I'm gonna have
a butler bring all my food for me.

04:17.490 --> 04:19.048
Cassie?

04:24.030 --> 04:25.725
Cassie!

04:30.837 --> 04:34.170
- Cassie!
- Ellen, I'm over here.

04:38.444 --> 04:40.878
Where were you? You're supposed
to be weeding in the garden.

04:40.980 --> 04:42.971
Don't be in a huff.

04:43.082 --> 04:48.611
I finished up in the garden, and I went and
put flowers on Ma and Pa's graves, and...

04:48.721 --> 04:53.624
I know it sounds silly, but I stayed
and talked to them for a while.

04:53.726 --> 04:57.856
- Lost track of time.
- It's not silly. I talk to them too.

04:57.964 --> 05:00.125
- You do?
- Of course I do.

05:00.233 --> 05:02.531
Looks like there's a storm coming.

05:06.072 --> 05:08.006
We'd best gather the laundry...

05:08.107 --> 05:10.371
get the livestock in the barn.

05:25.958 --> 05:28.085
How's it look out there?

05:28.194 --> 05:29.422
Wet.

05:29.529 --> 05:31.087
Windy.

05:31.197 --> 05:33.529
Very windy. It's a terrible storm.

05:33.633 --> 05:35.430
I know that.

05:35.535 --> 05:37.867
What I meant was, is the barn holding up?

05:37.970 --> 05:40.734
It's holding its ground.

05:40.840 --> 05:45.777
How can you just sit there calmly sewing
when the world outside is falling apart?

05:45.878 --> 05:49.006
I promised Mrs. Banks
I'd get this skirt to her by tomorrow.

05:49.115 --> 05:50.514
What if it's still raining?

05:50.616 --> 05:52.846
Finish drying the dishes.

05:52.952 --> 05:55.546
It'll get your mind off of things.

06:03.563 --> 06:05.758
Cassie, you'd best sweep that up.

06:05.865 --> 06:10.359
I'm sorry. I'll be more careful.
The thunder startled me.

06:24.650 --> 06:29.087
The garden is a mess,
but we can salvage the tomatoes and squash.

06:29.188 --> 06:32.214
It'll take some time
to get it back in shape.

06:32.325 --> 06:35.089
It's a good thing you put the livestock
in the barn last night.

06:35.194 --> 06:37.355
Well, at least only the chickens got out.

06:37.463 --> 06:38.930
Where do we start?

06:39.031 --> 06:41.727
We'll feed in the barn.
We'll gather the chickens.

06:41.834 --> 06:45.497
Then we can go into town, so I can get paid
on my work for Mrs. Banks's skirt.

06:45.605 --> 06:47.630
What about putting this
place back in order?

06:47.740 --> 06:49.674
First things first.

06:49.776 --> 06:52.574
We can go into town and get some
new fence posts at the hardware.

06:52.678 --> 06:55.306
At least I could stay
and start cleaning up the garden.

06:55.415 --> 06:57.144
Cassie, you're coming with me.

06:57.250 --> 07:00.515
Ellen, you are my sister, not my mother.

07:00.620 --> 07:02.247
And?

07:02.355 --> 07:06.257
It's not nice for big sisters to order
their little sisters around.

07:08.060 --> 07:09.755
All right, Cassie.

07:09.862 --> 07:12.330
Would you care to
accompany me to town today?

07:12.432 --> 07:14.923
I would love to.

07:15.034 --> 07:17.025
Could we get some apple pie at Millie's?

07:17.136 --> 07:19.969
When we're finished
taking care of business.

07:20.072 --> 07:23.200
Cassie Barlow, you can be
one stubborn young lady.

07:23.309 --> 07:25.971
<i>I am your sister.</i>

07:26.078 --> 07:28.171
I'll gather the chickens.

07:50.102 --> 07:52.935
- Whoa!
- How you doing?

08:04.217 --> 08:06.378
Well, that's the last one.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.078
Now can we go to Millie's?

08:08.187 --> 08:10.212
Well...

08:10.323 --> 08:12.086
I guess you earned it.

08:13.793 --> 08:15.988
Come on. Let's go get some apple pie.

08:21.567 --> 08:24.695
Ellen, Cassie.
Not used to seeing you two days in a row.

08:24.804 --> 08:27.432
Well, Sheriff,
it looks like your elbow was right again.

08:27.540 --> 08:31.271
Well, my elbow never fails me when it comes
to a storm. How'd your place weather it?

08:31.377 --> 08:33.402
It did considerable damage.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.879
Maybe now you'll be
looking for a hired man.

08:35.982 --> 08:39.349
I could use some help around the place,
and I can pay a proper wage.

08:39.452 --> 08:42.717
- You've been needing some help for some time now.
- I suppose so.

08:42.822 --> 08:47.225
Trouble is, all the able-bodied men
got gold fever and took off for California.

08:47.326 --> 08:49.692
But I don't have to remind you of that.

08:50.696 --> 08:52.288
Sorry.

08:52.398 --> 08:54.696
Didn't mean to
open up an old wound about Jake.

08:55.868 --> 08:57.733
That wound is long healed.

08:57.837 --> 09:00.738
Well, I'll certainly
keep my eyes and ears open.

09:00.840 --> 09:03.104
- I appreciate it.
- My pleasure.

09:39.378 --> 09:41.505
You wanna get
those in the ground...

09:43.249 --> 09:45.809
"Millie's CafÃ©, home style cooking."

09:45.918 --> 09:47.180
Sounds good to me.

09:49.121 --> 09:52.022
Ladies. Good day.

09:53.926 --> 09:56.326
We're here to eat. No trouble.

09:56.429 --> 09:59.523
- Would you ladies like anything else?
- Oh. No, thank you, Millie.

10:02.802 --> 10:05.396
- Where's Rose?
- Oh, she just ran out to get some flour.

10:05.504 --> 10:09.235
- She should be back anytime.
- Millie, I want to catch up on the town gossip.

10:09.342 --> 10:13.142
- Do you have time to sit down?
- Well, as soon as Rose gets back to mind the store.

10:20.920 --> 10:22.182
Ladies.

10:24.924 --> 10:27.984
Well, Trinity sure has
some good-looking womenfolk.

10:34.133 --> 10:36.499
Is there something I can get you young men?

10:36.602 --> 10:39.298
A hot meal. A good, hot meal.

10:39.405 --> 10:41.873
We've been traveling a long time.
I've been doing most of the cooking.

10:41.974 --> 10:44.875
Cassie, quit staring. It's not polite.

10:44.977 --> 10:47.172
Well, the special today
is chicken and dumplings.

10:47.279 --> 10:50.578
- Sounds real good.
- Yeah, I'll, uh... I'll take two orders.

10:50.683 --> 10:52.810
All right. Three orders of the special.
Anything to drink?

10:52.918 --> 10:54.715
Water will be fine. Thank you.

10:54.820 --> 10:56.481
All right.

11:00.026 --> 11:04.156
Well, this sure seems like
a real quiet town.

11:04.263 --> 11:07.096
I'd hate to be stuck here.

11:07.199 --> 11:09.099
Well, a lot of people
like living like that.

11:09.201 --> 11:12.329
Yeah, well, not me.
Excitement's what I crave.

11:13.673 --> 11:16.164
Ladies, good day to you.

11:16.275 --> 11:18.106
Uh, I don't mean to be rude.

11:18.210 --> 11:20.940
My name is Daniel Whittaker.
Well, what are your names?

11:25.117 --> 11:27.608
Well, don't that just say it all, hmm?

11:27.720 --> 11:30.518
I'm being real nice,
and these ladies are being rude.

11:30.623 --> 11:33.683
How about we just eat and get out of here?

11:33.793 --> 11:35.886
You know, I'm being real
friendly like to you women...

11:35.995 --> 11:38.520
and I can't even get
a simple hello in return?

11:38.631 --> 11:40.462
Hello.

11:40.566 --> 11:43.364
- Excuse me?
- You said you wanted a hello. I gave you one.

11:43.469 --> 11:47.235
- I wanted it from these ladies.
- Well, it seems they don't want conversation with you.

11:47.339 --> 11:49.364
Well, you two ought to mind
your own business.

11:54.213 --> 11:57.205
Now... Ah...
Ladies, you don't have to go nowhere.

11:57.316 --> 11:59.375
Daniel, we ain't looking for no trouble.

11:59.485 --> 12:01.749
No, we're not.
But it seems like these two boys are.

12:01.854 --> 12:03.583
No, we ain't looking for trouble.

12:03.689 --> 12:06.715
But if you insist, we can step outside.

12:06.826 --> 12:11.286
Look at it this way.
Walk away now, and you don't get hurt.

12:12.398 --> 12:14.298
John, Samuel, what is goin' on?

12:14.400 --> 12:16.732
What's it gonna be? The streets...

12:16.836 --> 12:18.736
or walk away?

12:27.113 --> 12:28.603
Stop it!

12:33.719 --> 12:35.653
Stop it.

12:35.755 --> 12:38.189
You listen to me. I said stop it!

12:38.290 --> 12:39.348
Stop it!

12:42.027 --> 12:44.495
I got the flour.

12:59.078 --> 13:01.478
Get up!

13:01.580 --> 13:04.378
I will shoot the man
who throws the next punch.

13:09.488 --> 13:12.787
Matter of fact,
this old scattershot ain't too choosy.

13:12.892 --> 13:15.827
She might just get all of you.
Put your hands up and sit down.

13:15.928 --> 13:17.828
- But, Sheriff, these two...
- I said sit.

13:18.998 --> 13:20.932
Run those boys out of town.

13:21.033 --> 13:23.297
They need to cool their heels, Sheriff.

13:26.338 --> 13:27.305
Millicent!

13:31.644 --> 13:34.374
- I'd like to know what happened here.
- Well, I was in the kitchen.

13:34.480 --> 13:37.677
Ellen came to get me,
and I came out just as the fight started.

13:40.653 --> 13:42.746
Well, let's get this sorted out, boys.

13:57.169 --> 13:59.069
Step inside, gentlemen.

14:03.108 --> 14:06.737
Uh, our horses are tied up on the street.

14:06.846 --> 14:09.872
Don't go fretting about your horses.
I'll see they end up at the stables.

14:09.982 --> 14:11.950
Of course, it'll cost you for board.

14:13.853 --> 14:15.878
Pick a bunk.

14:19.258 --> 14:22.523
I'm not sure how this is real fair, Sheriff.
Those two boys were just as guilty as we were.

14:22.628 --> 14:25.358
Witnesses say your friend here
threw the first punch.

14:25.464 --> 14:27.796
- Well, they provoked me.
- Is that all you have to say?

14:29.335 --> 14:31.428
What about you?
What do you got to say for yourself?

14:31.537 --> 14:33.903
Never did get a chance to eat.
Little hungry.

14:34.006 --> 14:36.839
I'll order you up some food from Millie's.

14:38.244 --> 14:40.644
If she'll feed you after what happened.

14:40.746 --> 14:42.714
I'm much obliged, Sheriff.

14:54.927 --> 14:56.588
"Never did get a chance to eat"?

14:56.695 --> 15:00.187
That... That's all you've got to say?
We just got railroaded.

15:02.334 --> 15:06.168
You caused this, again, and you know it.

15:10.809 --> 15:12.743
The next big wind, and this is coming down.

15:12.845 --> 15:16.281
That's why we'll have to
get the newest posts in before then.

15:16.382 --> 15:19.283
You and me aren't so good
at digging postholes.

15:19.385 --> 15:21.250
We'll learn. Grab the hammer and nails.

15:21.353 --> 15:23.981
We'll get the plank up so we can
get the horses back in the corral.

15:24.089 --> 15:28.321
Why did God bring
such a terrible storm on us?

15:28.427 --> 15:32.329
Pa used to say the good Lord and the devil got
credit for things they had nothing to do with.

15:32.431 --> 15:38.301
Sometimes things just happen,
natural course of events.

15:38.404 --> 15:40.895
Sometimes it's all so confoundin'.

15:41.006 --> 15:43.531
That's why we have to have
the faith of a child.

15:48.080 --> 15:49.877
Sure was exciting at Millie's today.

15:49.982 --> 15:52.951
- I guess you could call it that.
- What else would you call it?

15:53.052 --> 15:55.520
Crude and rude behavior.

15:59.091 --> 16:01.355
Let's get the plank up.

16:18.644 --> 16:20.908
- Hello, Rose.
- Hello, Sheriff.

16:21.013 --> 16:22.810
Ma made this for the prisoners.

16:22.915 --> 16:25.850
You can go on in. They're harmless.

16:31.857 --> 16:34.382
Hello there, little lady. And you are?

16:34.493 --> 16:36.017
I'm Rose. I'm Millie's daughter.

16:36.128 --> 16:37.686
Oh. Well...

16:39.598 --> 16:41.862
Oh, that smells tasty, Rose.

16:41.967 --> 16:44.663
You know, Mama is mighty mad at you two
for wrecking her place...

16:44.770 --> 16:47.398
but she decided to make that up
for you anyways.

16:47.506 --> 16:49.269
Said it was the Christian thing to do.

16:49.375 --> 16:50.933
Thank you. We're very grateful.

16:52.611 --> 16:54.238
Thank you, Rose.

16:57.082 --> 17:00.347
Well, one good thing...
We got our chicken and dumplings.

17:00.452 --> 17:03.012
You boys want some water,
you can call the night deputy.

17:03.122 --> 17:06.057
When you're finished with your food,
slide the plates under the door.

17:06.157 --> 17:08.319
And I'll see you in the morning.

17:11.329 --> 17:12.354
Hey, Sheriff.

17:13.799 --> 17:15.561
What's gonna happen to us?

17:15.666 --> 17:17.430
- Depends.
- Depends on what?

17:17.536 --> 17:19.560
If you plead guilty...

17:19.671 --> 17:21.695
you pay the assessed damages plus a fine.

17:21.807 --> 17:24.435
- What are the damages?
- Well, I haven't calculated that yet.

17:24.542 --> 17:28.377
The window's boarded up. I have no idea how
much the new glass and repairs will cost.

17:28.480 --> 17:31.040
Plus a table, chair or two.

17:31.150 --> 17:32.879
Yeah, well, we're pleading not guilty.

17:32.985 --> 17:35.818
Fine. When the judge hits town,
we'll hold a hearing in the jail.

17:35.921 --> 17:38.116
- When the judge hits town?
- Yeah.

17:38.223 --> 17:41.920
Circuit judge. Covers all the counties.
Should be back here in about 30 days.

17:42.027 --> 17:44.291
I ain't staying
in this jail for a month.

17:44.396 --> 17:48.162
- Well, then you'd best plead guilty.
- Well, that ain't justice.

17:48.267 --> 17:52.601
- I-I don't know what that is, but it sure ain't justice.
- We'll plead guilty.

17:52.704 --> 17:54.729
No, we're not!

17:54.840 --> 17:56.273
Well...

17:57.676 --> 18:00.110
I can see you boys
need some time to talk it over.

18:00.212 --> 18:02.510
Take the night.

18:08.921 --> 18:11.515
This ain't fair, Clark,
and we're not pleading guilty.

18:11.623 --> 18:13.591
You did throw the first punch.

18:13.692 --> 18:15.592
We got about three dollars between us.

18:15.694 --> 18:17.594
Th-That won't even cover a new window.

18:17.696 --> 18:20.927
Well, maybe we can work it off.

18:21.033 --> 18:23.695
Not me, old buddy.
I got bigger and better things to do...

18:23.802 --> 18:25.997
places to go, things to see.

18:26.105 --> 18:28.369
In case you hadn't noticed,
we're in a jail cell.

18:28.474 --> 18:31.602
Well, there ain't a jail built
I can't bust out of.

18:31.710 --> 18:34.372
Neither one of us has ever been locked up
before. What are you talking about?

18:34.480 --> 18:37.540
You got no imagination, Clark.
You never did.

18:37.649 --> 18:39.310
It's part of your charm, I guess.

18:39.418 --> 18:42.148
Just eat your food and go to bed.

19:54.026 --> 19:55.584
They'll shoot you.

19:55.694 --> 19:58.390
It's not too late. Come with me.

20:00.132 --> 20:02.225
You really think you're gonna
get away with this?

20:03.535 --> 20:06.800
Use your head for once,
and let's pay our debt.

20:06.905 --> 20:09.772
We didn't come this far
just so we could sit behind bars.

20:09.875 --> 20:12.537
If we don't get out of here now,
we're never gonna make it to California.

20:12.644 --> 20:15.545
- Grow up and be a man.
- Good luck, Clark.

20:16.748 --> 20:18.716
Look me up when you get out west.

20:18.817 --> 20:20.648
If you ever make it that far.

21:53.578 --> 21:57.139
I gathered the eggs.
The hens didn't do so well laying.

21:57.249 --> 21:59.183
Maybe the storm scared 'em.

21:59.284 --> 22:00.979
They'll settle down.

22:01.086 --> 22:03.748
- Do you want some help in the garden?
- That would be great.

22:05.424 --> 22:09.360
You know, if we made the garden bigger,
we could grow more stuff to sell.

22:09.461 --> 22:12.988
We could, after we fix the shingles
on the roof of the house...

22:13.098 --> 22:15.032
and repair the barn door.

22:15.133 --> 22:17.658
And get the new corral posts up.

22:20.005 --> 22:23.099
We weren't this close
when Pa was alive, were we?

22:23.208 --> 22:24.675
No.

22:26.111 --> 22:28.204
Why do you think that is?

22:28.313 --> 22:30.781
I suppose it's the age difference.

22:32.884 --> 22:37.014
And I was caught up in the trifles
that tend to divert a young woman.

22:37.122 --> 22:39.420
You mean Jake?

22:41.159 --> 22:43.389
Yes, Jake.

22:44.830 --> 22:47.765
- Do you miss him?
- I try not to think of it.

22:47.866 --> 22:51.825
It's been over two years,
and you haven't heard a word from him.

22:51.937 --> 22:55.236
- Do you think he's dead?
- I don't know.

22:55.340 --> 22:57.740
Well, if he wasn't dead...

22:57.843 --> 23:01.711
he would have written or sent
some kind of word from the goldfields.

23:01.813 --> 23:04.077
We parted on disagreeable terms.

23:05.450 --> 23:08.146
You part that way with a loved one, it...

23:08.253 --> 23:10.153
tends to make any loss more grievous.

23:10.255 --> 23:12.246
Was he your true love?

23:12.357 --> 23:15.588
You need years with someone
to know such a thing.

23:15.694 --> 23:19.892
True love is born of experience,
not fairy dust.

23:19.998 --> 23:22.398
Do you think I'll find my true love?

23:23.301 --> 23:25.064
Yes, you will.

23:26.438 --> 23:29.134
But first I need your help
clearing this garden.

23:41.420 --> 23:43.354
What have you got to say for yourself?

23:43.455 --> 23:45.685
When I went back to check on 'em,
the cell door was open.

23:45.791 --> 23:48.089
One was gone.
The other one was just sittin' there.

23:48.193 --> 23:50.627
- Excuse me?
- I don't know how it happened.

23:50.729 --> 23:54.631
I'll tell you how it happened. You fell asleep,
and a prisoner escaped using a dinner fork.

23:54.733 --> 23:57.964
I ought to lock you up in his place.

23:58.069 --> 24:00.594
Get out of here.
I'll figure out what to do with you later.

24:04.543 --> 24:07.103
Well, Mr. Clark Davis,
looks like you're on your own.

24:07.212 --> 24:08.543
Appears so.

24:08.647 --> 24:11.013
Mr. Whittaker skipped over to the stable,
broke in...

24:11.116 --> 24:13.550
took his horse and beat it out of town.

24:13.652 --> 24:15.313
Sounds about right.

24:15.420 --> 24:18.048
- Don't suppose you know anything about this.
- I'm here, aren't I?

24:22.794 --> 24:24.989
Yes, you are.

24:27.432 --> 24:30.367
- I was sleepin'.
- You and my deputy both.

24:30.469 --> 24:33.563
I woke up,
and Daniel was fooling with the lock.

24:33.672 --> 24:35.503
I tried to talk him out of it.

24:35.607 --> 24:39.043
- I suppose you're going after him now?
- Waste of my time.

24:39.144 --> 24:41.840
He'll just end up on the wrong side
of the law someplace else...

24:41.947 --> 24:43.642
if the devil don't get him first.

24:43.748 --> 24:45.716
I will put his name out on the wire though.

24:45.817 --> 24:48.377
We've been friends since childhood.

24:48.487 --> 24:51.183
I'd be careful who I'd call friend.

24:53.992 --> 24:57.985
I pled guilty. Now what?

24:58.096 --> 25:00.291
The fine for public nuisance is $10.

25:00.398 --> 25:03.196
The repairs at Millie's
will probably be about 30.

25:15.514 --> 25:17.072
I got $1.50.

25:17.182 --> 25:21.585
That'll cover about three weeks' board
on your horse over at the stable.

25:21.686 --> 25:24.086
I'll go get you some breakfast
since you'll be staying here.

25:24.189 --> 25:26.054
- Sheriff, wait.
- What is it now?

25:26.157 --> 25:28.955
Isn't there some way I could work it off?

25:38.069 --> 25:39.434
Hyah.

26:07.732 --> 26:09.723
Millicent, can I have a word with you?

26:11.369 --> 26:14.304
I'd like to run something by you
concerning this young man.

26:15.240 --> 26:16.468
I'm listening.

26:17.576 --> 26:19.134
Sit.

26:22.881 --> 26:25.577
So, what's this all about?
Where's the other one?

26:25.684 --> 26:29.211
Slipped out last night
while my deputy was sleeping.

26:29.321 --> 26:33.781
Came in this morning, and this one's
just sitting there. The door's wide open.

26:33.892 --> 26:36.656
Now why do you suppose he didn't leave?

26:36.761 --> 26:42.461
I believe he is a responsible young man who
would like to do right by you and the town.

26:42.567 --> 26:44.762
In fact, that's what I came
to talk to you about.

26:44.869 --> 26:47.269
I'm still listenin'.

26:51.876 --> 26:53.844
Won't be much further now.

26:56.948 --> 26:58.973
Do you mind if I ask where we're going?

26:59.084 --> 27:00.881
Nope.

27:02.120 --> 27:04.315
No, you don't mind, or no, don't ask?

27:04.422 --> 27:06.822
Barlow Farm.

27:06.925 --> 27:09.086
Ellen Barlow lives there
with her sister Cassie.

27:09.194 --> 27:11.128
They've been looking for some hired help.

27:11.229 --> 27:14.790
Can't pay much, but it'll suit your needs
paying off what you owe.

27:14.899 --> 27:19.802
- Two women living alone?
- Pa died last winter. Mom died giving birth to Cassie.

27:22.140 --> 27:24.074
And you're trusting me not to run?

27:24.175 --> 27:26.075
You give me your word you'll stay?

27:26.177 --> 27:28.475
You have my word on it.

27:28.580 --> 27:30.810
Your word's good enough for me.

27:30.915 --> 27:33.440
But if you run, I will find you...

27:33.551 --> 27:35.451
and I may have to shoot you.

27:55.340 --> 27:57.240
You can make camp up there.

27:58.309 --> 28:00.209
Close to work, out of the ladies' hair.

28:00.311 --> 28:02.279
Plenty of game up there. You'll make do.

28:02.380 --> 28:05.406
Ellen! Cassie!

28:08.153 --> 28:10.087
Ellen, it's Sheriff Holden.

28:10.722 --> 28:12.553
Hello, Sheriff.

28:12.657 --> 28:16.024
- Good day to you, Sheriff.
- Ellen.

28:16.127 --> 28:19.153
That fellow with the sheriff is the one
that was in the fight at Millie's.

28:19.264 --> 28:21.164
Yes, it seems so.

28:22.300 --> 28:24.734
Sheriff, what can we do for you today?

28:24.836 --> 28:26.827
It's what I can do for you.

28:26.938 --> 28:29.406
Ellen Barlow, Cassie Barlow,
meet Clark Davis.

28:29.507 --> 28:31.407
The solution to your hired hand problem.

28:34.913 --> 28:38.280
Sheriff Holden, why don't you step down
so we can talk in private?

28:38.383 --> 28:39.475
Yes, ma'am.

28:41.252 --> 28:43.117
Cassie...

28:43.221 --> 28:45.212
make sure he don't run off.

28:47.192 --> 28:49.717
You and those other fellas
sure tore up Millie's place.

28:49.828 --> 28:52.661
Yeah, we sure did.
I'm really sorry about that.

28:52.764 --> 28:55.995
It was a grand fight.
Grandest fight I ever saw.

28:56.101 --> 28:58.695
In fact, the only fight I ever saw.

28:58.803 --> 29:00.828
Rose too. Rose is Millie's daughter.

29:00.939 --> 29:04.568
Cassie, hold the horse. Stop talking.

29:06.845 --> 29:08.642
Why'd you bring that criminal here?

29:08.747 --> 29:10.806
- He's not a criminal.
- Then what is he?

29:10.915 --> 29:14.578
He's an able-bodied man who will work
for you to pay off Millie and the law.

29:14.686 --> 29:16.745
He started a brawl. He can't be trusted.

29:16.855 --> 29:19.187
First of all, he did not start the brawl.
Millie and you said so.

29:19.290 --> 29:21.554
- That is beside the point.
- No, it is not beside the point.

29:21.659 --> 29:25.993
And secondly, I'm a damn good judge of human
nature, and that boy has a good, solid character.

29:26.097 --> 29:28.497
You have only known him for a day.

29:28.600 --> 29:31.194
The other one broke out of jail and took off.
This one stayed to face the music.

29:31.302 --> 29:32.860
That tells me a lot about his character.

29:33.838 --> 29:35.533
We'll find someone else.

29:35.640 --> 29:39.201
Ellen Barlow,
you are as stubborn as your old man.

29:39.310 --> 29:42.939
Besides, there is no one else,
and you sorely need him.

29:46.985 --> 29:48.316
Fine.

29:48.419 --> 29:51.183
But only on a trial basis.
One week at a time.

29:51.289 --> 29:54.452
Minus the $1.50 he already paid,
he owes 38.50.

29:54.559 --> 29:56.550
A month's wages ought to cover that debt.

29:56.661 --> 29:59.061
I told him he could
camp up there on the hill.

30:00.431 --> 30:03.400
- Thank you, Cassie.
- You're welcome, Sheriff.

30:06.671 --> 30:09.299
- You leaving?
- Appears so.

30:09.407 --> 30:12.171
Don't you worry. I'll be back
to check on you from time to time.

30:12.277 --> 30:14.905
- Good-bye, Sheriff.
- Stay out of trouble, Cassie.

30:15.013 --> 30:16.708
You too, Sheriff.

30:18.016 --> 30:20.280
Cassie.

30:24.022 --> 30:26.422
Miss Barlow, I just want to tell you
it's a pleasure to meet you...

30:26.524 --> 30:28.424
and, uh, I really appreciate
this job opportunity.

30:28.526 --> 30:30.653
Look, Mr...
What's your name?

30:30.762 --> 30:32.593
It's Davis. Clark Davis.

30:32.697 --> 30:36.326
Mr. Davis, I truly do not feel comfortable
having the likes of you around...

30:36.434 --> 30:39.835
but we need some hired help,
and you're all there seems to be.

30:39.938 --> 30:42.998
- The likes of me?
- I heard your friend say you were going to the goldfields.

30:43.107 --> 30:46.702
- Is there somethin' wrong with that?
- Dreamers, chasin' rainbows...

30:46.811 --> 30:48.745
lookin' for gold, get rich quick.

30:48.847 --> 30:50.439
Well, there is gold to be found.

30:50.548 --> 30:53.278
Look. If you're gonna work here,
you best get started.

30:53.384 --> 30:57.286
Half a day's already gone. If I'm gonna pay
you a daily wage, I expect a full day's work.

30:57.388 --> 30:59.754
Yes, ma'am. You'll get a full day's work.
Just tell me where to start.

30:59.858 --> 31:02.053
Well, there's plenty that needs attention.

31:02.160 --> 31:04.287
You can start by fixing the barn door.

31:09.567 --> 31:11.000
Okay.

31:13.171 --> 31:15.264
She's not so ornery
once you get to know her.

31:15.373 --> 31:17.398
I might not live long enough
to get to know her then.

31:17.508 --> 31:21.308
There's tools and a ladder in the barn,
and the lumber's out back.

31:21.412 --> 31:23.812
Come on. I'll show you, Mr. Davis.

31:23.915 --> 31:27.146
Just call me Clark. Mr. Davis is my pa.

31:31.689 --> 31:33.486
You best be careful up there.

31:33.591 --> 31:36.151
I will. Thanks for the advice.

31:41.399 --> 31:43.765
- You sure you know what you're doing?
- Well...

31:43.868 --> 31:45.563
guess we're gonna find out.

31:46.838 --> 31:49.068
Cassie, would you come here, please?

31:49.173 --> 31:51.835
Gotta go see what she wants.

31:58.549 --> 32:01.643
- Do you need me?
- Of course I need you.

32:01.753 --> 32:04.881
- But I'm helping with the barn door.
- Come on inside the house.

32:23.841 --> 32:25.832
Did you want to talk about something?

32:25.944 --> 32:29.812
I think it's better if we maintain a
distance from him till we get to know him.

32:29.914 --> 32:32.508
How do we get to know him
if we maintain a distance?

32:32.617 --> 32:37.213
We know nothin' about him except he started
a fight, and he got thrown in jail.

32:37.322 --> 32:39.688
Now, please,
just stay away from him for now.

32:39.791 --> 32:42.726
I best get back. He may need my help.

32:42.827 --> 32:45.125
Cassandra Mae, did you hear a word I said?

32:45.229 --> 32:48.221
Every word, Ellen Louise.

33:04.949 --> 33:07.008
You fixed it.

33:10.288 --> 33:12.381
Hope so.

33:14.425 --> 33:18.657
Sometimes I have to remind Ellen
that she is my sister and not my mother.

33:18.763 --> 33:21.095
- She's concerned for you.
- I can take care of myself.

33:21.199 --> 33:24.032
Oh, yes, ma'am. I'm sure you can.

33:27.038 --> 33:30.235
Headin' to California...
that sounds so very excitin'.

33:30.341 --> 33:32.172
Your sister don't seem to think so.

33:32.276 --> 33:33.766
- That's 'cause of Jake.
- Jake?

33:33.878 --> 33:36.779
Jake Weller. He was Ellen's sweetheart.

33:36.881 --> 33:40.817
Moved to California with gold fever
about two years ago.

33:40.918 --> 33:43.910
He wanted her to pack up and go with him,
but she didn't want that.

33:44.022 --> 33:47.389
- Yeah? What happened to him?
- Don't know. Haven't heard a word from him.

33:48.626 --> 33:50.457
Well...

33:50.561 --> 33:52.222
that could prejudice someone
against the pursuit of gold.

33:52.330 --> 33:56.061
Yes, sir, it could.
She has very hard feelings against it too.

33:56.167 --> 33:59.933
Yeah, seems so. Hey, would you grab that
two-by-four and slide it right under this door?

34:06.110 --> 34:08.373
Thank you. You're a real big help.

34:08.478 --> 34:10.811
- Really?
- Really.

34:43.447 --> 34:46.042
All fixed?

34:46.150 --> 34:48.050
I believe so.

34:50.822 --> 34:52.722
It stayed up.

34:53.491 --> 34:54.458
So far.

34:59.197 --> 35:00.494
It's working.

35:00.598 --> 35:02.327
Well, it's staying on the hinges.

35:02.433 --> 35:04.128
That's the important part.

35:04.235 --> 35:06.829
Cassie, we need to
take my mending to town and deliver it.

35:06.938 --> 35:09.873
- Go pack the wagon and get ready to go.
- Can't I stay here?

35:09.974 --> 35:12.738
I thought we'd go by Millie's for lunch.
You can catch up with Rose.

35:12.844 --> 35:15.972
- I'm going.
- I'll hitch the team.

35:16.080 --> 35:18.139
Well, looks like you fixed it.

35:18.249 --> 35:20.410
Seems like it.

35:21.586 --> 35:23.349
Can I give you a hand with that team?

35:23.454 --> 35:25.786
No, that won't be necessary.
I can manage on my own.

35:25.890 --> 35:28.154
Okay. What do you have in mind next?

35:28.259 --> 35:32.389
Corral. One of the posts has rotted out.
Other three need mending.

35:32.497 --> 35:36.024
The new posts are behind the barn, and all
the tools you'll need are inside the barn.

35:38.069 --> 35:40.003
I'll get right on it.

35:47.745 --> 35:49.679
Me and Rose are going
to the dry goods store.

35:49.780 --> 35:51.748
<i>Rose and I.</i>

35:51.849 --> 35:55.080
All right. Rose and I are
going to the dry goods store.

35:55.186 --> 35:57.882
And please remember
to see if my gingham material's come in.

35:57.989 --> 36:00.150
You'll be back in time for the supper rush?

36:00.258 --> 36:02.419
- Yes, ma'am.
- Thanks.

36:06.264 --> 36:09.392
I have to admit.
That fight was pretty exciting.

36:09.500 --> 36:11.161
Oh, I don't know.

36:11.269 --> 36:15.000
I take it you have a hired hand
working for you now?

36:15.106 --> 36:17.768
Trial basis, one week at a time.

36:17.875 --> 36:20.867
I don't know how I feel
about trusting a man who gets in a fight.

36:20.978 --> 36:24.436
Well, the sheriff brought him by here.
Seemed like a pretty solid fella.

36:24.549 --> 36:26.517
We'll see.

36:26.617 --> 36:28.551
And he's not too disagreeable to look at.

36:28.653 --> 36:30.746
Millie, please.

36:32.323 --> 36:34.223
I hadn't noticed.

36:34.325 --> 36:36.486
Oh, of course you haven't.

37:13.998 --> 37:17.229
Let your good and perfect will
be done in Cassie's life.

37:18.135 --> 37:20.296
Let no one stand in your way.

37:22.440 --> 37:24.499
Not even me.

37:26.744 --> 37:28.405
Good night, Ma.

37:29.447 --> 37:31.210
Good night, Pa.

37:46.864 --> 37:49.458
- Good morning, Miss Barlow.
- Good morning.

37:49.567 --> 37:53.298
When you're finished with that post, Mr...
Mr. Davis...

37:53.404 --> 37:55.463
don't forget the other
three that are loose.

37:55.573 --> 37:57.768
I won't forget.

37:57.875 --> 37:59.433
Miss Barlow.

38:02.713 --> 38:03.975
Yes?

38:04.081 --> 38:06.675
You know, I never intended on being here.

38:06.784 --> 38:09.048
If I could have repaid that debt,
I would have.

38:09.153 --> 38:11.451
But I gave the sheriff
my word I would see this through.

38:11.555 --> 38:14.115
- Your point is?
- Long as I'm here, I'm gonna be civil to you.

38:14.225 --> 38:16.125
All I ask is you do the same in return.

38:16.227 --> 38:19.663
I am being civil with you, Mr. Davis.

38:32.643 --> 38:34.702
He's a real hard worker, ain't he?

38:34.812 --> 38:36.939
<i>Isn't he.</i>

38:37.048 --> 38:41.417
He has motive to be. Once he pays
off his debt, he'll be on his way.

38:41.519 --> 38:43.817
He's not like the other
gold diggers we've met.

38:43.921 --> 38:45.752
They're all the same.

38:45.856 --> 38:49.257
After fortune and adventure.

38:49.360 --> 38:51.828
He hums while he works.

38:51.929 --> 38:54.625
Pa was always humming while he was workin'.

38:58.002 --> 38:59.833
Does this fella remind you of Pa?

38:59.937 --> 39:01.427
No.

39:02.473 --> 39:04.373
I was just wonderin'.

39:27.231 --> 39:29.461
- Here's your lunch.
- Oh.

39:29.567 --> 39:33.128
Ellen's the second-best cook
in the whole county, next to Millie.

39:33.237 --> 39:35.364
Of course, you know
Millie's place real well.

39:35.473 --> 39:37.100
Yeah, I'm afraid I do.

39:37.208 --> 39:40.507
Thank you, Cassie.
This looks really good. I appreciate it.

39:40.611 --> 39:42.909
If you need a drink,
there's a tin hanging from the pump.

39:47.184 --> 39:49.778
This post is solid.

39:49.887 --> 39:51.821
You're doing a real dandy job.

39:51.922 --> 39:53.947
Dandy as a dandelion.

39:57.161 --> 40:00.824
- What?
- My pa used to say that all the time.

40:00.931 --> 40:03.661
I've never heard
anyone else say that before.

40:03.768 --> 40:07.568
Yeah, I'd heard he had passed on.
I'm really sorry to hear that.

40:07.671 --> 40:09.798
No, it's all right.

40:09.907 --> 40:11.841
It's good to hear it again.

40:14.512 --> 40:17.276
Cassie.
When you're finished, I need you.

40:17.381 --> 40:19.645
She just can't seem to get on without me.

40:21.519 --> 40:22.816
It's good to be needed.

40:27.124 --> 40:30.821
- Cassie, now, please.
- I have to go.

40:42.339 --> 40:46.298
- Go on inside and put this on.
I took out the hem some. - Why?

40:46.410 --> 40:48.901
'Cause you're getting so tall,
the dress is looking too short.

40:49.013 --> 40:52.005
And I always want you to look your best.
Besides, the dance is comin' up.

40:52.116 --> 40:53.674
I forgot about that.

41:01.692 --> 41:04.388
You know, Cassie's right.
You're a real good cook.

41:05.396 --> 41:06.863
Thank you.

41:17.007 --> 41:18.668
Sew away, Sis.

41:25.850 --> 41:27.943
He's humming again.

41:29.086 --> 41:33.022
I can hear that. There's no law against it.

41:34.425 --> 41:38.225
You know, this time of year,
we could get another storm.

41:38.329 --> 41:41.162
If a body was camped outside,
it sure would be miserable.

41:41.265 --> 41:45.201
Is that your way of saying we should allow
Mr. Davis to move to shelter?

41:45.302 --> 41:47.793
Oh, do you think so?

41:47.905 --> 41:50.373
Your concern for his well-being...
it's duly noted.

41:51.876 --> 41:55.744
- Is that a no?
- Yes. Now turn around so I can see the back.

41:55.846 --> 42:00.215
- Will you think about it?
- Would you hold still?

42:21.071 --> 42:22.971
You turned out to be quite the farmer.

42:25.376 --> 42:27.640
I didn't even hear you ride up.

42:27.745 --> 42:29.645
My grandpa was half Osage.

42:29.747 --> 42:32.682
He'd sneak up on a rabbit,
grab it by the ears with one hand.

42:32.783 --> 42:34.478
- You just riding by?
- Nope.

42:35.686 --> 42:38.678
Rode out to check on you,
like I said I would.

42:38.789 --> 42:40.950
You holding up all right?

42:41.058 --> 42:43.720
Uh...
Yes, sir.

42:43.827 --> 42:47.888
Ellen's a tad pushy and a bit headstrong,
but she's a good person.

42:47.998 --> 42:51.092
She's guilty on the first two counts,
but I haven't seen the nice part yet.

42:51.201 --> 42:52.793
Few do.

42:52.903 --> 42:55.463
Gal's got a... heavy burden...

42:55.573 --> 42:57.973
what with keeping this place going
and raising Cassie.

42:58.075 --> 43:00.202
Yes, sir. Well...

43:00.311 --> 43:02.279
Well, I'm still here, so you can rest easy.

43:02.379 --> 43:07.146
I knew you were a man of your word.
But I never rest easy. You'll be seeing me again.

43:07.251 --> 43:09.446
I'll count on it.

43:09.553 --> 43:12.078
Got an answer back on that wire I sent out
on Daniel Whittaker.

43:12.189 --> 43:16.125
Turns out he got himself arrested
for rustling a few counties west of here.

43:17.494 --> 43:19.587
- Are they gonna hang him?
- Could be.

43:19.697 --> 43:23.690
Funny how life is. If you'd been with him,
you could be facing the noose.

43:23.801 --> 43:25.792
But here you are.

43:27.972 --> 43:29.439
Hyah! Hyah!

43:31.075 --> 43:32.975
Yeah, here I am.

43:34.878 --> 43:37.711
You make the best apple pie
this side of the Mississippi.

43:37.815 --> 43:39.646
<i>What's wrong with my apple pie?</i>

43:39.750 --> 43:42.514
Nothin'.
It just comes second to Millie's.

43:42.620 --> 43:45.953
You are too kind.
So how's your hired hand doing?

43:46.056 --> 43:49.457
He allows me to help.
And he treats me like an adult.

43:49.560 --> 43:51.824
Unlike someone else I know.

43:51.929 --> 43:53.988
He seems to be a hard worker.

43:54.098 --> 43:56.032
Ellen's being kinda ornery with him.

43:56.133 --> 43:59.034
He works for us.
We're not meant to be his friend.

43:59.136 --> 44:01.900
Well, you can be kinda ornery
with a lot of folks.

44:02.006 --> 44:04.133
Well, some folks deserve it.

44:22.860 --> 44:24.327
Hello.

44:25.129 --> 44:27.029
- Mornin'.
- Mornin'.

44:28.198 --> 44:30.666
You're almost finished with the corral.

44:30.768 --> 44:32.668
Couple more planks, it'll be there.

44:32.770 --> 44:35.330
I'm gonna go pick
wildflowers in the meadow.

44:35.439 --> 44:37.066
Maybe one day you can pick some for me.

44:37.174 --> 44:39.142
Sure. Just tell me when.

44:42.279 --> 44:44.270
Miss Barlow, how are you?

44:44.381 --> 44:45.848
Fine.

44:51.455 --> 44:53.923
- You do good work.
- Thank you.

44:54.024 --> 44:55.821
My pa taught me a lot about carpentry.

44:55.926 --> 44:57.587
Come in real handy around here.

44:57.695 --> 45:03.361
So, you have a trade, yet you decide to
waste your life on trivial pursuits.

45:03.467 --> 45:07.028
I guess you just got me
all figured out, don't you, Miss Barlow?

45:07.137 --> 45:11.665
Well, I don't understand how a man
can leave his family and his home...

45:11.775 --> 45:13.606
and travel clear across the country...

45:13.711 --> 45:16.578
in pursuit of a few little rocks,
no matter how much they're worth.

45:16.680 --> 45:19.945
Well, I think some men
are just in pursuit of a better life.

45:20.050 --> 45:21.779
Others want a shortcut.

45:21.885 --> 45:24.445
I was in it for the adventure.

45:30.694 --> 45:33.822
So, what's next?

45:34.832 --> 45:36.629
After you leave here?

45:36.734 --> 45:38.668
Probably keep heading west.

45:38.769 --> 45:41.932
Catch a steamer out of San Francisco.
Head on over to China.

45:42.039 --> 45:43.267
China?

45:44.708 --> 45:47.176
New adventure. New places. New people.

45:47.277 --> 45:51.236
Doesn't sound like you have
any plans to settle down anytime soon.

45:51.348 --> 45:53.816
One day I would like to settle down.

45:53.917 --> 45:55.612
Have a family.

46:12.569 --> 46:16.061
Chickens have been laying real good
since you got here. Think they like ya.

46:16.173 --> 46:19.006
Yeah? Guess that makes me
a regular ol' rooster, huh?

46:20.544 --> 46:22.375
There's a dance in town this Saturday.

46:22.479 --> 46:23.969
Never been to a dance.

46:24.081 --> 46:28.177
There's plenty of good food,
socializing and music.

46:28.285 --> 46:31.186
- Are you and your sister goin'?
- Never miss it.

46:31.288 --> 46:33.654
- Maybe you could go with us?
- You have to ask Ellen that.

46:33.757 --> 46:35.725
Ask Ellen what?

46:37.895 --> 46:40.022
Well? I'm waitin'.

46:40.130 --> 46:41.961
Could he go to the dance with us?

46:44.234 --> 46:46.327
Well, if he wants to, all right.

46:46.436 --> 46:48.870
No, that's all right. I, uh...

46:48.972 --> 46:50.735
I don't have any fancy clothes anyway.

46:50.841 --> 46:53.537
I think we could find him a suit to wear.

47:12.696 --> 47:14.926
Good to see ya again.

47:20.871 --> 47:22.771
Sure hope this suit looks all right.

47:22.873 --> 47:26.400
Looks better than all right.
Fits you better than it did Pa.

47:30.113 --> 47:31.944
You look beautiful.

47:32.049 --> 47:34.677
I haven't worn this dress
in over two years.

47:35.385 --> 47:37.182
Not since Jake left.

47:37.287 --> 47:40.222
Cassie told me about him.

47:40.324 --> 47:43.418
She can't keep her mouth shut
to save her soul.

47:43.527 --> 47:45.256
You still look very fetching.

47:46.597 --> 47:48.997
I took it out of the closet just for today.

47:53.804 --> 47:55.635
Ellen.

47:55.739 --> 47:57.434
Look at you all slicked up.

47:59.276 --> 48:00.971
There'll be no trouble here, boys.

48:01.078 --> 48:04.479
Ah, we ain't lookin' for any trouble,
Sheriff. Ain't that right, John?

48:04.581 --> 48:06.208
Nah, just commentin'
on how different he looks.

48:06.316 --> 48:07.908
What is it that you boys want?

48:08.018 --> 48:09.747
Just wanted to shake this fella's hand.

48:09.853 --> 48:13.914
And to tell him we feel
partially responsible for his trouble.

48:17.160 --> 48:19.424
- Yeah, you mean that?
- My word on it.

48:19.529 --> 48:21.053
Bygones are bygones.

48:22.232 --> 48:23.893
Enjoy the dance.

48:27.704 --> 48:29.467
You do look very spiffy.

48:32.976 --> 48:34.910
Come on. Let's dance.

48:35.012 --> 48:38.448
John, would you be a dear
and get me a punch?

48:38.548 --> 48:39.913
My pleasure. Ellen?

48:40.017 --> 48:42.076
No, thanks. I'm fine.

48:48.759 --> 48:52.126
So, will we be seeing Mr. Davis
at services tomorrow?

48:52.229 --> 48:56.029
I mentioned it to him on the way here.
Seems he's not a spiritual man.

48:56.133 --> 48:59.102
Oh, my. That's too bad.

48:59.202 --> 49:00.863
Do you find him handsome?

49:00.971 --> 49:02.461
You know I do.

49:05.876 --> 49:08.344
I find him passable at best.

49:10.547 --> 49:13.710
Okay, slightly more than passable.

49:16.420 --> 49:19.514
He's a hard worker. Good craftsman.

49:19.623 --> 49:21.318
Seemingly of pleasant nature.

49:21.425 --> 49:25.555
He's got a good spirit.
Just needs a little cultivatin'.

49:25.662 --> 49:27.892
And he'll be leaving soon.

49:32.736 --> 49:34.431
Thank you for the dance,
kind sir.

49:34.538 --> 49:36.199
My pleasure, madam.

49:39.543 --> 49:41.238
Some fine dancin' out there, Mr. Davis.

49:41.345 --> 49:43.040
You should dance with him, Ellen.

49:43.146 --> 49:46.013
Now, Cassie,
normally the fella asks the gal to dance.

49:46.116 --> 49:48.311
Well, ask her.

49:49.486 --> 49:51.215
May I have this dance?

49:51.321 --> 49:53.255
You may.

49:56.026 --> 49:57.823
I'm gonna go find Rose.

50:05.369 --> 50:08.736
- Oh, they make a fine-looking couple.
- That they do.

50:13.443 --> 50:15.343
Now, Millie...

50:15.445 --> 50:17.140
don't you go playin' Cupid.

50:17.247 --> 50:19.147
That boy is set on leavin'.

50:21.985 --> 50:23.213
We'll see.

50:23.320 --> 50:26.016
Cassie's so eager to grow up.

50:27.891 --> 50:29.722
I can remember wantin' to grow up.

50:29.826 --> 50:31.225
Have you?

50:32.963 --> 50:34.692
I think so.

50:37.701 --> 50:39.566
I know what I want now.

50:39.669 --> 50:43.571
So many of the things that I thought
were the most important in the world...

50:43.673 --> 50:46.198
well, they turned out not to be.

50:46.309 --> 50:48.743
I owe you an apology.

50:50.847 --> 50:53.077
I don't think so.

50:53.183 --> 50:57.950
When you first came into our lives,
I prejudged you.

50:59.322 --> 51:01.381
But you're not the person
I believed you to be.

51:01.491 --> 51:03.322
You don't have to do that. It's fine.

51:03.427 --> 51:05.088
Let me finish.

51:05.195 --> 51:08.995
I feel like... I'm getting to know you.

51:10.067 --> 51:13.161
The real you, not my perception of you.

51:14.604 --> 51:16.333
I mean, I like you.

51:17.641 --> 51:19.336
I like you too.

52:00.016 --> 52:03.474
Cassie, you best hurry.
We don't want to be late for service.

52:03.587 --> 52:05.054
I'm comin'!

52:07.124 --> 52:08.716
Good mornin'.

52:09.893 --> 52:11.622
Mornin'.

52:11.728 --> 52:14.219
Saw the team hitched up.
Figured y'all was headin' off to church.

52:14.331 --> 52:17.596
We don't have a church in the usual sense.

52:17.701 --> 52:19.896
Services are held outside
in the common area.

52:20.003 --> 52:21.334
I see.

52:21.438 --> 52:25.272
Well, I invited you once before,
and... I shall do it again.

52:25.375 --> 52:27.104
Would you care to join us?

52:27.210 --> 52:30.407
I do appreciate the offer, but I think
I'm gonna stay here and tend to the garden.

52:30.514 --> 52:32.482
We could all use an ounce of faith.

52:32.582 --> 52:35.881
Miss Barlow, I'm not even sure
if I know what that word means.

52:35.986 --> 52:40.582
Faith means believin' in somethin' greater
than oneself. A higher power.

52:40.690 --> 52:42.351
Well, if it's all the same...

52:42.459 --> 52:44.518
I think I'll spend my day doing something
a little more constructive.

52:44.628 --> 52:48.029
<i>Worship is constructive, Mr. Davis.</i>

52:48.131 --> 52:50.099
It's the most important work of all.

52:50.200 --> 52:53.294
Well, if it's okay with you,
we'll just agree to disagree on that one.

52:53.403 --> 52:55.200
But I do appreciate the offer to the dance.

52:55.305 --> 52:57.739
You're welcome.

52:59.543 --> 53:01.010
Cassandra!

53:03.113 --> 53:04.842
Mornin', Clark.

53:04.948 --> 53:07.382
Cassie, please, in the wagon.

53:07.484 --> 53:09.418
I don't want to be late.

53:10.687 --> 53:12.587
Let me help you up.

53:22.966 --> 53:26.766
We always have a potluck after services.

53:26.870 --> 53:29.031
- You'll have to scrounge for your lunch.
- I'll make do.

53:50.627 --> 53:53.653
- Mr. Davis.
- Miss Barlow.

53:53.763 --> 53:57.927
It's the end of the week. Your pay.

53:58.034 --> 54:01.094
- Wasn't Miss Millie at the service?
- She was.

54:01.204 --> 54:05.766
- You can just give it to her.
- No, it's not my place.

54:05.875 --> 54:07.570
It's better if you do.

54:07.677 --> 54:09.838
All right. Thank you.

54:15.819 --> 54:19.414
The garden is looking wonderful.

54:19.522 --> 54:21.888
Thank you.
The, uh, tomato's lookin' real ripe.

54:21.992 --> 54:23.926
Eggplant's just about ready to be picked.

54:24.027 --> 54:25.927
We can take it into town tomorrow.

54:26.029 --> 54:28.623
I sell most of my crops
at the general store.

54:28.732 --> 54:31.565
- You can visit Millie then.
- Sure thing.

54:32.802 --> 54:34.429
You know, I'm just about done here...

54:34.537 --> 54:37.165
so I'll probably pack up my stuff
and head back up to camp.

54:40.377 --> 54:44.507
- We're just about to sit for Sunday supper.
- Is that an invitation?

54:44.614 --> 54:48.846
It's the proper Sunday thing to do,
Mr. Davis.

54:48.952 --> 54:50.852
Well, then I'd be obliged to accept.

54:53.590 --> 54:55.785
Miss Barlow.

54:55.892 --> 54:58.918
Perhaps since you and I are gonna share
Sunday supper together...

54:59.029 --> 55:01.020
maybe we can call each other
by our given names.

55:01.131 --> 55:04.259
All right.

55:04.367 --> 55:07.063
You best wash up before you come inside.

55:07.170 --> 55:08.694
Sure thing, Ellen.

55:19.115 --> 55:21.845
- Cassie, did you pick those flowers?
- For you. Just like you asked.

55:23.853 --> 55:26.185
You wouldn't mind if I took 'em tomorrow
when we go into town, would ya?

55:26.289 --> 55:28.086
They're yours to do as you like with them.

55:29.225 --> 55:32.092
I find gardening
very relaxing and enjoyable.

55:32.195 --> 55:34.425
Plant some seeds, add some water...

55:34.531 --> 55:38.194
a little sunlight,
and life magically springs from the ground.

55:38.301 --> 55:41.464
That sounds so very poetic.

55:41.571 --> 55:43.596
I hear what you're sayin'.
I feel the same way.

55:43.707 --> 55:47.768
We've been wantin' to expand our garden,
grow some more vegetables.

55:47.877 --> 55:50.539
I might be able to help with that.

55:50.647 --> 55:52.444
With the boss's permission.

55:52.549 --> 55:55.575
I suppose that would be all right.

55:55.685 --> 55:58.051
Probably just need some wildflower seeds,
we'll plant around the garden.

55:58.154 --> 55:59.746
It'll look real nice.

55:59.856 --> 56:03.587
- Who wants to say grace?
- I'll say it. It's my turn anyway.

56:03.693 --> 56:07.390
Mr. Davis... I mean, Clark,
would that be all right with you?

56:07.497 --> 56:09.431
It's perfectly all right.

56:19.209 --> 56:21.973
Lord, thank you for this food
that we are about to receive...

56:22.078 --> 56:24.945
and thank you for our new friend Clark.

56:25.048 --> 56:26.948
Please watch over him.

56:27.050 --> 56:31.043
Even though he doesn't much believe in you,
he's still a kind and decent man.

56:31.154 --> 56:33.622
Also, please keep watch over Ma and Pa.

56:33.723 --> 56:36.556
Your friend, Cassie Barlow. Amen.

56:38.161 --> 56:40.061
See? That wasn't so hard.

56:46.970 --> 56:48.801
I really appreciate the hospitality.

56:48.905 --> 56:52.671
I really enjoyed the meal and the company.
Especially the company.

56:52.776 --> 56:55.404
- You're quite welcome.
- Maybe we can do it again.

56:55.512 --> 56:57.241
It was special for Sunday.

56:57.347 --> 56:59.110
Maybe again next Sunday?

56:59.215 --> 57:01.445
Maybe.

57:01.551 --> 57:05.510
Cassie was thinkin' you'd be more comfortable
sleepin' in the barn instead of outside.

57:05.622 --> 57:06.816
There's an old cot and everything.

57:06.923 --> 57:08.584
You'd have a roof over your head.

57:08.691 --> 57:10.318
Are you sure?

57:10.427 --> 57:13.555
She asked you. Of course she's sure.

57:15.565 --> 57:17.590
Well, I, uh... I better be up early...

57:17.700 --> 57:19.930
get the squash and tomatoes picked
and packed up for town.

57:20.036 --> 57:22.561
- I'll help you.
- After your house chores.

57:22.672 --> 57:24.196
After my house chores.

57:24.307 --> 57:27.208
- Ladies, thank y'all again.
- You're welcome.

57:33.183 --> 57:35.617
He's hummin' again.

57:35.718 --> 57:37.743
Yes, I can hear that.

57:39.789 --> 57:41.689
We should put the dishes up.

57:45.595 --> 57:48.564
Are you going to help me,
or am I your slave?

58:06.449 --> 58:08.076
Go. Go.

58:08.184 --> 58:09.651
Get off.

58:34.677 --> 58:36.838
Well...

58:36.946 --> 58:38.846
beats sleepin' on the ground.

58:59.669 --> 59:02.502
Well, they're a little wilted,
but I hope she likes 'em.

59:02.605 --> 59:04.835
All women like flowers, wilted or not.

59:04.941 --> 59:07.535
It's the thought behind them that counts.

59:07.644 --> 59:09.475
So I'll meet y'all back here then?

59:09.579 --> 59:12.980
We're going by the dry goods store
and then a few other places.

59:13.082 --> 59:16.540
- Will an hour do you?
- That's plenty enough time. See y'all in an hour.

59:17.654 --> 59:20.521
Who do you suppose those flowers are for?

59:20.623 --> 59:24.320
I don't know.
Some gal, I guess. He said "she."

59:26.529 --> 59:28.121
Ellen.

59:28.231 --> 59:31.098
Are you just curious,
or are you a little jealous?

59:31.200 --> 59:33.828
Jealous? Rue the day.

59:33.937 --> 59:36.929
Just curious.

59:37.040 --> 59:39.975
Let's go by the dry goods store
and check on that material.

59:40.076 --> 59:41.873
Then we can go by Millie's.

59:43.379 --> 59:45.210
I'm planning it for Tuesday.

59:45.315 --> 59:46.543
Thank you.

59:49.419 --> 59:52.786
Uh, Ma, you'd best get out here.

59:58.528 --> 01:00:00.621
Well, you folks can get back to eatin'.

01:00:00.730 --> 01:00:02.630
Rose, you mind the stove?

01:00:05.702 --> 01:00:10.002
Uh, these are for you.
Sorry. They're a bit wilted.

01:00:13.376 --> 01:00:15.367
Nothin' a little fresh water can't fix.

01:00:24.287 --> 01:00:28.621
You know, I never truly apologized to you.
But I am now.

01:00:28.725 --> 01:00:32.217
Well, if you feel the need,
then apology accepted.

01:00:35.131 --> 01:00:37.361
These are very pretty flowers.

01:00:37.467 --> 01:00:39.492
Uh, Cassie... she picked 'em.

01:00:39.602 --> 01:00:41.695
You and Cassie gettin' along all right?

01:00:41.804 --> 01:00:43.999
Yes, ma'am. Just fine.

01:00:44.107 --> 01:00:48.544
Would you like to sit down,
maybe have a piece of pie?

01:00:48.645 --> 01:00:50.545
Oh, I... I probably
shouldn't stay too long.

01:00:50.647 --> 01:00:53.013
The ladies are waitin' on me.
They're doin' a bit of shoppin'.

01:00:53.116 --> 01:00:55.676
Well, if they're shoppin',
it's gonna be a while.

01:00:55.785 --> 01:00:57.252
Come on.

01:00:58.588 --> 01:01:00.749
Rose, would you bring me
a piece of apple pie?

01:01:00.857 --> 01:01:02.324
Yes, ma'am.

01:01:04.961 --> 01:01:06.861
I also brought your payment.

01:01:07.964 --> 01:01:10.023
You are a young man of principle.

01:01:11.167 --> 01:01:12.259
My father.

01:01:12.368 --> 01:01:15.360
"Be a man of principle and responsibility."

01:01:15.471 --> 01:01:17.666
In the old days,
I would've told you to forget it.

01:01:18.675 --> 01:01:20.643
I lost a lot of money that way.

01:01:20.743 --> 01:01:24.839
Now I read the good book, and it tells me
to be a cheerful giver and receiver.

01:01:24.947 --> 01:01:28.678
So, I will cheerfully receive this money...

01:01:28.785 --> 01:01:30.616
and give you a piece of pie.

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:33.814
- That's very kind of you.
- Oh, not really.

01:01:33.923 --> 01:01:35.823
I figured this is
the only money you've got...

01:01:35.925 --> 01:01:38.052
and you probably couldn't
afford to pay for the pie.

01:01:41.698 --> 01:01:45.190
Rosie, would you do me a favor
and go polish the silverware?

01:01:45.301 --> 01:01:47.599
Oh, yes, ma'am.

01:01:49.706 --> 01:01:53.870
Teenage girls.
Full of curiosity and mischief.

01:02:03.052 --> 01:02:04.986
Life can be very confounding, Miss Millie.

01:02:07.623 --> 01:02:09.716
Something weighin' on you, Clark?

01:02:12.161 --> 01:02:14.755
It is an ever-changing adventure we are on.

01:02:14.864 --> 01:02:16.559
Sure is a fact.

01:02:16.666 --> 01:02:20.397
Be diligent. Give life time.

01:02:20.503 --> 01:02:23.131
We never do know what's
right around the corner.

01:02:23.239 --> 01:02:26.106
Well, lookee who dropped in.

01:02:26.209 --> 01:02:28.905
With Clark here, I was wondering
if you two were gonna stop by.

01:02:29.011 --> 01:02:31.605
Well, if I'd known he was coming here,
we would've come with him.

01:02:31.714 --> 01:02:34.410
He brought me those flowers over there.

01:02:34.517 --> 01:02:36.747
Kind of an apology gift.

01:02:38.187 --> 01:02:39.677
Well, isn't that sweet?

01:02:39.789 --> 01:02:41.780
Rose is in the kitchen.

01:02:42.692 --> 01:02:44.489
Ellen, come sit.

01:02:44.594 --> 01:02:47.961
- Yep, and I best be checkin' on the team.
- No. Stay. They'll be all right.

01:02:48.064 --> 01:02:52.296
Well, it's pretty hot outside, so they might
need some water. Thank you for the pie.

01:02:59.041 --> 01:03:00.975
Looks like I run him off.

01:03:01.077 --> 01:03:03.011
He's a very nice young man.

01:03:03.112 --> 01:03:06.548
Not at all like the ones
who caught that gold fever.

01:03:07.917 --> 01:03:11.216
- He's responsible.
- It would seem that way.

01:03:12.555 --> 01:03:15.547
There's a big difference between...

01:03:15.658 --> 01:03:19.617
just having a crush on somebody
and truly being in love.

01:03:25.301 --> 01:03:27.462
I dried out the vegetable seeds
like you said.

01:03:27.570 --> 01:03:30.835
All I have to do now is go get
some wildflower seeds from the meadow.

01:03:30.940 --> 01:03:34.137
Be careful in that tall grass.
The rattlers are out this time of year.

01:03:34.243 --> 01:03:35.710
I will.

01:03:39.816 --> 01:03:43.115
The garden is gonna be great.

01:03:48.558 --> 01:03:51.527
She's very excited about the garden.

01:03:51.627 --> 01:03:53.857
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

01:03:53.963 --> 01:03:56.591
- You ready to plant soon?
- Yeah.

01:03:56.699 --> 01:04:00.760
Just keep turning the soil for a bit, add
some of that dry manure from the milk cow...

01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:02.770
water it for a couple days and plant.

01:04:02.872 --> 01:04:05.841
- You sure know a lot about everything.
- Just basic things.

01:04:05.942 --> 01:04:08.638
- You read a lot?
- Some.

01:04:08.744 --> 01:04:10.735
Mostly I learned from my pa.

01:04:10.847 --> 01:04:13.042
He tried to teach me
to be a well-rounded man.

01:04:13.149 --> 01:04:16.607
- You close to him?
- Very. My ma too.

01:04:16.719 --> 01:04:20.746
You know, we had some problems
when I was growing up, but...

01:04:20.857 --> 01:04:22.882
nothing we couldn't get through
without him shootin' me.

01:04:22.992 --> 01:04:24.619
That would've been awful.

01:04:24.727 --> 01:04:28.561
Then you wouldn't be here, digging in
the dirt and playing in dry manure.

01:04:32.001 --> 01:04:33.468
Your pa laugh a lot?

01:04:33.569 --> 01:04:35.799
- Yeah.
- Mine too.

01:04:35.905 --> 01:04:37.668
You miss him.

01:04:37.773 --> 01:04:40.105
I do. Almost every day.

01:04:41.177 --> 01:04:43.407
Sometimes I think I hear him laugh.

01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:47.148
And I turn around,
expecting him to be there.

01:04:47.250 --> 01:04:50.378
- Silly, huh?
- No.

01:04:50.486 --> 01:04:52.716
No, it's not silly.

01:04:52.822 --> 01:04:56.588
Those are memories.
Memories are what our lives end up being.

01:04:56.692 --> 01:04:59.388
- Your pa teach you that?
- And he learned it from my ma.

01:05:03.566 --> 01:05:05.500
We gotta hang on to the good ones...

01:05:05.601 --> 01:05:07.330
let the bad ones go.

01:05:07.436 --> 01:05:09.131
Never let 'em haunt us.

01:05:15.711 --> 01:05:17.702
- Shoot.
- King me.

01:05:20.449 --> 01:05:21.438
Your move.

01:05:28.457 --> 01:05:30.721
I wouldn't move there if I were you.

01:05:41.604 --> 01:05:43.333
I know what you're thinkin'.

01:05:43.439 --> 01:05:44.463
Do you?

01:05:44.573 --> 01:05:47.133
Cassie's forming an attachment.

01:05:48.611 --> 01:05:52.308
Cassie told Rose that Clark Davis
reminds her of her father.

01:05:53.349 --> 01:05:55.249
I suspected as much.

01:05:56.152 --> 01:05:58.120
He'll be leaving soon.

01:05:58.220 --> 01:06:01.678
Moving on to California,
following his dream.

01:06:01.791 --> 01:06:03.782
He's not like all the rest of 'em.

01:06:06.295 --> 01:06:09.958
What? You said so yourself.

01:06:10.066 --> 01:06:13.035
Oh. Oh, my.

01:06:13.135 --> 01:06:17.037
Oh, Millie.
Now don't go jumpin' to conclusions.

01:06:17.139 --> 01:06:19.073
You're sweet on him.

01:06:19.175 --> 01:06:21.541
No, I'm not sweet on him.

01:06:21.644 --> 01:06:24.204
I don't have the time,
nor the inclination...

01:06:24.313 --> 01:06:26.474
for such luxuries.

01:06:30.853 --> 01:06:33.253
He's a good man.

01:06:33.356 --> 01:06:35.586
Which will make it
all the more difficult when he leaves.

01:06:35.691 --> 01:06:38.057
You've gotta think about Cassie.

01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:41.561
She never knew her mother.
She lost her father.

01:06:42.598 --> 01:06:44.566
How's she gonna handle him leaving?

01:06:57.380 --> 01:06:59.507
Have you seen Cassie?

01:06:59.615 --> 01:07:02.675
She told me she was gonna pick some flowers
and visit your folks.

01:07:02.785 --> 01:07:06.016
Oh. Talkin' to them gives her peace.

01:07:06.122 --> 01:07:08.920
Guess we all could use
an ounce of that from time to time.

01:07:09.025 --> 01:07:10.686
She's become really fond of you.

01:07:10.793 --> 01:07:12.920
She's a special young lady.

01:07:14.330 --> 01:07:16.298
Your commitment here will be over soon.

01:07:19.869 --> 01:07:21.962
Reckon it will.

01:07:22.071 --> 01:07:25.040
You'll be headin' out west to California?

01:07:27.176 --> 01:07:28.871
That's been the plan for a long time.

01:07:28.978 --> 01:07:31.242
I don't think it'll set well with Cassie.

01:07:31.347 --> 01:07:33.872
I don't think it's gonna set well
with me either.

01:07:35.184 --> 01:07:36.310
And you?

01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:40.081
What about me?

01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:47.290
My ma always told me that a person
who answers a question with a question...

01:07:47.396 --> 01:07:50.263
is just avoidin' the first question.

01:07:50.366 --> 01:07:54.097
You must be gettin' hungry.
I'll go fix your lunch.

01:08:08.818 --> 01:08:13.016
Do you think the Lord holds a grudge
against Clark for not keeping the Sabbath?

01:08:13.122 --> 01:08:15.420
I don't think the Lord holds grudges.

01:08:15.524 --> 01:08:18.652
I think that's something
we human beings are inflicted with.

01:08:29.939 --> 01:08:32.772
- Well, how was services?
- They were wonderful.

01:08:32.875 --> 01:08:36.207
Millie made bread pudding for the potluck.
It was scrumptious.

01:08:36.312 --> 01:08:39.109
She asked about you. Rose did too.

01:08:39.215 --> 01:08:42.377
Cassie, go on inside and change
and put some flour on the chicken.

01:08:42.484 --> 01:08:44.385
I'll be right in to mash the potatoes.

01:08:47.857 --> 01:08:49.551
Payday.

01:08:58.667 --> 01:09:00.725
Everything all right?

01:09:00.836 --> 01:09:02.029
Yes.

01:09:02.138 --> 01:09:03.627
Well, thank you.

01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:07.171
- For?
- The money.

01:09:09.612 --> 01:09:11.910
You more than earned it.
I wish it could be more.

01:09:12.014 --> 01:09:13.982
No, it's fine.

01:09:15.283 --> 01:09:17.684
- It's Sunday.
- That it is.

01:09:17.786 --> 01:09:21.381
- Will you be joining us for supper?
- Is that an invitation?

01:09:21.490 --> 01:09:25.483
Well, remember what your mother said
about answering a question with a question.

01:09:25.594 --> 01:09:29.325
Yes, I'd love to join you for supper.

01:09:29.430 --> 01:09:32.399
Tidy up. I've got chicken to fry.

01:09:32.501 --> 01:09:35.060
I'll unhitch the team for you.

01:09:44.145 --> 01:09:46.046
What happened next?

01:09:46.148 --> 01:09:49.174
So there were Daniel and I.
We were creeping right behind these grave robbers...

01:09:49.285 --> 01:09:51.879
on this road so dark you couldn't even
see your own two feet.

01:09:51.987 --> 01:09:55.047
- Were you scared?
- Little bit.

01:09:55.157 --> 01:09:58.126
Them old boys, they got thirsty.
So they laid that corpse down on the road...

01:09:58.227 --> 01:10:00.593
and they headed off to the creek
to get a quick drink.

01:10:00.696 --> 01:10:02.129
And then what happened?

01:10:02.231 --> 01:10:04.199
Daniel and I, we grabbed
that old poor dead fella...

01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:06.461
and we flung him in the ditch!

01:10:06.569 --> 01:10:09.970
And then Daniel gets
down, just like this...

01:10:10.072 --> 01:10:12.404
and he stretches out in
that corpse's place.

01:10:12.508 --> 01:10:15.068
- No foolin'?
- No foolin'.

01:10:15.177 --> 01:10:19.045
Them old boys came back, they didn't realize
their corpse was a few inches shorter.

01:10:19.148 --> 01:10:22.049
And there was Daniel,
lying back, just like this.

01:10:24.486 --> 01:10:26.044
What did Daniel say?

01:10:26.155 --> 01:10:27.747
He said...

01:10:28.857 --> 01:10:31.724
"Am I gettin' heavy, fellas?"

01:10:33.495 --> 01:10:35.292
I was a bit rowdy in my younger days.

01:10:35.397 --> 01:10:37.695
I bet you were.

01:10:48.143 --> 01:10:50.441
- Hello, Clark.
- Miss Millie.

01:10:55.017 --> 01:10:57.611
- Is it that day already?
- Yes, ma'am.

01:11:00.055 --> 01:11:02.819
Time just slips by.

01:11:04.593 --> 01:11:06.788
Such a precious thing
we can never get back.

01:11:06.895 --> 01:11:10.296
Seems to be goin' faster too.
Probably 'cause I been so busy.

01:11:10.399 --> 01:11:12.924
Being happy can cause time to fly too.

01:11:14.436 --> 01:11:15.903
Yes, ma'am.

01:11:16.005 --> 01:11:17.768
So, won't be long.

01:11:17.873 --> 01:11:19.898
Won't be an indentured servant anymore.

01:11:20.009 --> 01:11:22.500
Well, I guess I never thought
about it quite like that.

01:11:22.611 --> 01:11:26.342
Suppose you'll be heading west,
following your dream?

01:11:26.448 --> 01:11:28.939
I reckon.

01:11:29.051 --> 01:11:31.451
I thought about it a lot as of late.

01:11:31.553 --> 01:11:33.145
It's been my plans for a long time.

01:11:35.524 --> 01:11:37.424
Plans can change.

01:11:37.526 --> 01:11:38.993
Yes, ma'am.

01:11:54.576 --> 01:11:56.771
Hold up there, Mr. Davis.

01:11:56.879 --> 01:11:58.574
Sheriff.

01:11:58.681 --> 01:12:02.481
I got some news for you
on, uh, Daniel Whittaker.

01:12:02.584 --> 01:12:04.882
- They hang him?
- Nope.

01:12:04.987 --> 01:12:06.682
Escaped the noose this time.

01:12:06.789 --> 01:12:08.484
Got six months on a chain gang.

01:12:08.590 --> 01:12:10.319
That's good news.

01:12:10.426 --> 01:12:11.757
Could be.

01:12:11.860 --> 01:12:14.351
Or maybe they just
postponed the inevitable.

01:12:14.463 --> 01:12:16.397
I'm obliged you told me.

01:12:16.498 --> 01:12:19.899
Yep. Good seeing you
at the dance the other night.

01:12:20.002 --> 01:12:23.768
- Ellen looked mighty pretty.
- Yes, sir.

01:12:23.872 --> 01:12:26.033
- Yes, she did.
- Mm-hmm.

01:12:27.276 --> 01:12:29.972
Elbow's acting up.

01:12:30.079 --> 01:12:32.411
Big storm brewin'.

01:12:45.994 --> 01:12:49.259
Mind that old ladder.
Wouldn't want you to break your neck.

01:12:49.365 --> 01:12:51.299
Very funny, Miss Cassie.

01:12:58.741 --> 01:13:00.208
Good morning, Clark.

01:13:00.309 --> 01:13:03.176
- Mornin'.
- Beautiful day, isn't it?

01:13:03.278 --> 01:13:05.644
That it is. None better.

01:13:05.748 --> 01:13:07.272
You fixin' shingles?

01:13:08.684 --> 01:13:10.879
Probably take a few days
to tighten them all down.

01:13:10.986 --> 01:13:13.750
- Sheriff's predicting rain.
- I think his elbow is wrong this time.

01:13:16.959 --> 01:13:19.086
At least not for a few days.

01:13:44.453 --> 01:13:46.819
Looks like Sheriff Holden's elbow
was right again.

01:13:47.823 --> 01:13:49.723
Apparently so.

01:13:49.825 --> 01:13:52.487
Could've held off a few days
so I could get those shingles fixed.

01:13:54.396 --> 01:13:56.694
Looks like the old roof's
holding up just fine.

01:13:57.933 --> 01:14:00.629
- It's your move.
- Will the stock be all right?

01:14:00.736 --> 01:14:03.102
Put 'em in the barn
before it even started rainin'.

01:14:04.606 --> 01:14:06.506
It's still your move.

01:14:12.948 --> 01:14:14.677
Still your move.

01:14:18.153 --> 01:14:19.620
The storm's gettin' worse.

01:14:19.721 --> 01:14:21.621
It seems that way.

01:14:33.969 --> 01:14:37.666
Oh, I knew I should've fixed that
when I first got here.

01:14:37.773 --> 01:14:41.869
- Where you going?
- Everything I need to fix it is still up on the roof.

01:14:41.977 --> 01:14:44.571
- It can wait.
- It's rainin' outside.

01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:48.514
Well, little bit of water
never hurt nothin'.

01:14:48.617 --> 01:14:50.346
Except a good checker game.

01:14:50.452 --> 01:14:52.852
Clark, please, stay inside.

01:15:02.331 --> 01:15:04.231
Lightning can hurt you.

01:15:04.333 --> 01:15:06.358
Especially if you're on a roof.

01:15:17.479 --> 01:15:19.879
Do you think he'll be all right up there?

01:15:19.982 --> 01:15:22.041
Lord, I hope so.

01:15:22.150 --> 01:15:24.050
You need to tell him to get down.

01:15:24.152 --> 01:15:26.814
All right. I'll try.

01:15:30.792 --> 01:15:33.226
If you haven't noticed,
he can be a little stubborn.

01:15:45.874 --> 01:15:46.863
Cassie!

01:16:01.323 --> 01:16:03.291
Is he dead?

01:16:04.459 --> 01:16:07.121
I'll probably wish I'd be tomorrow.

01:16:08.597 --> 01:16:10.656
I'm sorry. I'm gonna
get back up to the barn.

01:16:10.766 --> 01:16:12.666
- No, no, no.
- No. You'll sleep here tonight.

01:16:12.768 --> 01:16:14.736
We'll sleep by the fireplace,
right, Ellen?

01:16:14.836 --> 01:16:16.394
You'll stay here tonight.

01:16:16.505 --> 01:16:19.838
How does your head feel?

01:16:19.942 --> 01:16:21.671
Is it sore?

01:16:23.045 --> 01:16:25.013
Do you have a headache?

01:16:25.113 --> 01:16:26.580
No.

01:16:27.583 --> 01:16:30.017
Good. That's not a concussion.

01:16:32.888 --> 01:16:34.014
Cassie...

01:16:34.122 --> 01:16:36.022
will you go and fix Clark some coffee?

01:16:46.835 --> 01:16:49.065
I was so scared when you fell.

01:16:50.038 --> 01:16:51.801
I thought I'd lost you.

01:16:55.978 --> 01:17:00.108
But I should've had faith that the good Lord
who brought you here wouldn't take you away.

01:17:03.919 --> 01:17:06.683
I prayed, and he answered.

01:17:07.889 --> 01:17:09.516
He did answer.

01:17:13.562 --> 01:17:15.257
Now, Ellen, I...

01:17:19.935 --> 01:17:21.562
Rest now...

01:17:24.306 --> 01:17:26.331
my love.

01:17:37.252 --> 01:17:40.881
Lord, you deliver us from evil...

01:17:40.989 --> 01:17:44.550
you allow no weapons
formed against us to prosper.

01:17:47.295 --> 01:17:49.422
Thank you for protecting Clark.

01:17:52.234 --> 01:17:55.829
Clark? Are you sure
you should be out of bed?

01:17:59.207 --> 01:18:00.970
How's the stock?

01:18:01.076 --> 01:18:03.203
Everything's there except the milk cow.

01:18:03.311 --> 01:18:05.245
Storm blew the door open last night.

01:18:05.347 --> 01:18:08.339
- She won't go far.
- I'll check the meadow.

01:18:11.053 --> 01:18:13.749
I'll check the woods.
She probably ran for cover.

01:18:15.323 --> 01:18:16.984
I'll go with you.

01:18:20.962 --> 01:18:23.692
You know, her milk
might be spoiled for a couple days.

01:18:23.799 --> 01:18:25.926
Fright tends to do that to a cow.

01:18:26.034 --> 01:18:27.934
That's no matter.

01:18:29.337 --> 01:18:31.532
You're walkin' a little stiff.

01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:34.438
Feelin' a little stiff.

01:18:34.543 --> 01:18:35.805
And sore.

01:18:37.279 --> 01:18:39.543
I was so frightened
when you fell last night.

01:18:39.648 --> 01:18:42.776
I'm lucky I ain't crippled. Or worse.

01:18:42.884 --> 01:18:46.945
But nothin' happened.
It was a miracle, plain and simple.

01:18:48.523 --> 01:18:50.957
"He is faithful who promised."

01:18:51.059 --> 01:18:53.755
Yeah, well, late last night...

01:18:53.862 --> 01:18:55.853
after the storm, when it got quiet...

01:18:56.732 --> 01:18:58.666
I said a prayer.

01:19:01.570 --> 01:19:03.561
I haven't done that in years.

01:19:04.372 --> 01:19:05.999
Clark.

01:19:06.108 --> 01:19:09.305
You know, I think I might've gotten back
some of that faith I used to have.

01:19:09.411 --> 01:19:11.845
When I was a kid,
Ma and Pa took me to church.

01:19:13.281 --> 01:19:15.408
You never told me you used to go to church.

01:19:15.517 --> 01:19:17.747
I don't know what happened. I...

01:19:17.853 --> 01:19:19.753
I just sort of fell away from church.

01:19:22.390 --> 01:19:24.449
Last night...

01:19:24.559 --> 01:19:26.823
you kissed me on the forehead.

01:19:26.928 --> 01:19:28.691
You called me your love.

01:19:30.165 --> 01:19:32.531
I thought you were sleepin'.

01:19:32.634 --> 01:19:34.192
Did you mean it?

01:19:34.302 --> 01:19:37.863
Yes. I meant it.

01:19:37.973 --> 01:19:39.964
And I mean it now.

01:19:47.215 --> 01:19:48.978
Thanks for breaking the mood, Sarah.

01:19:55.090 --> 01:19:56.557
All right.

01:20:00.162 --> 01:20:02.892
I can't wait. I'll be right over.

01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:08.099
So you're really not going to California?

01:20:08.203 --> 01:20:12.367
I've been thinking on it. You know,
like Millie said, sometimes plans change.

01:20:12.474 --> 01:20:15.307
Something special changing those plans?

01:20:18.346 --> 01:20:20.246
Whoa. Whoa!

01:20:20.348 --> 01:20:22.248
- John, good to see you.
- All right.

01:20:22.350 --> 01:20:24.648
- Go ahead and get out, folks.
- Good to see you too.

01:20:24.753 --> 01:20:26.243
- How you doin'?
- All right.

01:20:26.354 --> 01:20:28.686
- Burt.
- Sir.

01:20:28.790 --> 01:20:31.054
How you doin', sir?

01:20:32.527 --> 01:20:34.427
- Don't you think?
- Oh, I definitely agree.

01:20:34.529 --> 01:20:36.292
Oh, my gosh.

01:20:36.398 --> 01:20:37.865
What's wrong?

01:20:37.966 --> 01:20:40.491
Just need to get your signature right here.

01:20:40.602 --> 01:20:42.069
That's him.

01:20:48.176 --> 01:20:49.234
Who?

01:20:49.344 --> 01:20:51.437
Jake Weller.

01:21:00.455 --> 01:21:02.218
What are you gonna do?

01:21:02.324 --> 01:21:04.952
I guess I should go talk to him.

01:21:05.060 --> 01:21:08.427
- What will you say?
- I don't know.

01:21:10.832 --> 01:21:12.026
Clark, I...

01:21:12.133 --> 01:21:15.864
No, no. It's, uh... You do what you must.

01:21:15.971 --> 01:21:17.871
It's fine.

01:21:31.219 --> 01:21:32.447
Hello, Jake.

01:21:36.157 --> 01:21:38.091
Hello, Ellen.

01:21:38.193 --> 01:21:39.626
You're alive.

01:21:40.896 --> 01:21:42.591
Why would I be anything else?

01:21:42.697 --> 01:21:45.257
I never expected to see you again.

01:21:45.367 --> 01:21:48.302
Well, I told you I would come back.

01:21:48.403 --> 01:21:50.963
That was over two years ago.

01:21:51.072 --> 01:21:53.040
And not a word from you since.

01:21:54.542 --> 01:21:56.442
I thought you were dead.

01:22:11.726 --> 01:22:13.626
It's so good to see you.

01:22:15.897 --> 01:22:18.525
Cassie, why don't you wait on Ellen.
I'm gonna ride back.

01:22:21.536 --> 01:22:24.471
I'll take you all the way
to St. Louis. Yes, ma'am.

01:22:24.572 --> 01:22:26.506
Don't you wanna see what happens?

01:22:30.845 --> 01:22:32.938
That ain't nothin' I need to see.

01:22:40.255 --> 01:22:41.882
Hey, is Millie still in business?

01:22:41.990 --> 01:22:43.389
Um...

01:22:47.295 --> 01:22:48.489
Yes.

01:22:48.596 --> 01:22:50.496
Okay. Well, let's go there,
have something to eat.

01:22:50.598 --> 01:22:52.190
We can catch up on lost time.

01:22:52.300 --> 01:22:54.063
All right.

01:22:54.169 --> 01:22:56.137
We can catch up on things.

01:23:00.108 --> 01:23:02.633
- You need some help?
- No, we're good.

01:23:02.744 --> 01:23:03.904
All right.

01:23:06.348 --> 01:23:08.748
I hit the big one.

01:23:08.850 --> 01:23:11.216
Enough gold to buy a small country.

01:23:11.319 --> 01:23:15.653
Bought a big, beautiful house
in San Francisco, up on a hill.

01:23:16.858 --> 01:23:19.986
You can watch the Pacific Ocean all day.

01:23:20.095 --> 01:23:22.996
I'm real happy for you, Jake.

01:23:23.098 --> 01:23:25.191
Oh, you're gonna love it there.

01:23:26.601 --> 01:23:30.059
I... can't imagine livin' in San Francisco.

01:23:32.307 --> 01:23:35.208
Well, neither could I, but...

01:23:35.310 --> 01:23:36.777
look at me.

01:23:36.878 --> 01:23:40.575
You seem very happy and sure of yourself.

01:23:40.682 --> 01:23:43.310
Yeah, well, now I'm back, Ellie.

01:23:43.418 --> 01:23:46.046
A rich man, just like I promised.

01:23:46.154 --> 01:23:49.749
And I'm sittin' across a table from you...

01:23:49.858 --> 01:23:51.758
Asking you to marry me.

01:23:51.860 --> 01:23:54.021
Are you proposin'?

01:23:55.697 --> 01:23:57.062
Yes.

01:23:58.333 --> 01:24:00.233
Yes, I am, Ellen Barlow.

01:24:03.038 --> 01:24:05.097
Will you marry me?

01:24:35.804 --> 01:24:37.567
Clark?

01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:40.974
I'm so sorry.

01:24:41.076 --> 01:24:42.737
Me too.

01:24:44.012 --> 01:24:45.980
I'm gonna go back up to the hill camp.

01:24:46.081 --> 01:24:48.242
I'll finish my commitment up there.

01:24:52.053 --> 01:24:54.681
I know you must be feeling
confused and hurt.

01:24:54.789 --> 01:24:57.849
Could be. I'll be all right.

01:25:01.496 --> 01:25:06.991
Millie once told me there's a difference
between a crush and true love.

01:25:08.036 --> 01:25:09.936
And I understand now what she meant.

01:25:11.372 --> 01:25:15.138
You told me about
bad memories that can haunt.

01:25:17.412 --> 01:25:19.710
There's only room in my life for one man.

01:25:21.249 --> 01:25:23.513
And he's the man I wanna marry.

01:25:24.752 --> 01:25:26.652
And that man is Clark Davis.

01:25:38.433 --> 01:25:40.230
Are you sure?

01:25:40.335 --> 01:25:44.237
I've never been more sure
about anything in my entire life.

01:25:51.412 --> 01:25:53.744
Nothin' I thought I wanted matters anymore.

01:25:57.585 --> 01:25:59.052
Only you.

01:26:01.156 --> 01:26:03.056
Will you marry me?

01:26:14.502 --> 01:26:17.130
<i>I now pronounce you man and wife.</i>

01:26:18.940 --> 01:26:21.204
Son, you may kiss your bride.

01:26:21.309 --> 01:26:23.470
Aw.

01:26:34.756 --> 01:26:37.589
<i>Clark Davis
never did make it to California.</i>

01:26:37.692 --> 01:26:39.683
<i>He never made his fortune in gold...</i>

01:26:39.794 --> 01:26:42.058
<i>nor saw the Great Wall of China.</i>

01:26:42.163 --> 01:26:45.860
<i>Instead he found his way
to the Barlow Farm...</i>

01:26:45.967 --> 01:26:48.936
<i>and into our lives and hearts.</i>

01:26:49.037 --> 01:26:52.939
<i>"For where your treasure is,
there will your heart be also. "</i>
