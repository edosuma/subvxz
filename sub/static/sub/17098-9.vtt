He sounds kind of like
Korea's Louis Riel.

was a great hero.

00:14.542 --> 00:16.458

So was Louis Riel
for a lot of people.

00:16.500 --> 00:18.709
But nobody hang Admiral Yi.

00:18.750 --> 00:20.667
-Just because
he was hanged...
-Help!

00:22.709 --> 00:24.291
-Do you need to...
-Nope.

00:24.709 --> 00:27.583
-Okay, see you.
-Catch ya later, Mr. Kim.

-But I think if I...
-No, you don't think.

00:47.625 --> 00:49.458
That's your problem.
Hmm?

00:49.500 --> 00:53.458
Even baby look and say,
"Take can from top."

00:53.500 --> 00:55.500
Are you saying
I'm like a baby?

00:55.542 --> 00:58.750
I not even
talking genius baby,
like one who play flute.

00:58.792 --> 01:00.917
I'm talking regular baby,

01:00.959 --> 01:04.000
even they know
don't take a can
from middle.

01:04.041 --> 01:05.542
But most of these
cans have a dent.

01:05.583 --> 01:07.166
Except this one.

01:07.208 --> 01:11.083
Dent ravioli taste exactly
same as smooth ravioli.

01:11.125 --> 01:13.959
-It's inside that count.

-Oh.

01:36.208 --> 01:40.208
Next time,

01:42.750 --> 01:44.834
Oh, this one is meat.

01:44.875 --> 01:46.667

02:36.917 --> 02:40.125
"Have to helping out."
(LAUGHS) Wonderful.

02:40.667 --> 02:42.667
Jeanie would love
to see Janet again.

02:42.709 --> 02:43.667
Isn't that right, Jeanie?

02:43.709 --> 02:45.417
-Jeanie.
-Jeanie.

02:54.542 --> 02:57.500
-What about your son?
-Oh, well he is...

02:57.542 --> 03:00.417
Does Jung need permission
from his parole officer?

03:00.458 --> 03:02.959
-Jung has never been in jail.
-Really? I could have sworn...

03:03.000 --> 03:05.625
Only youth detention centre,
and now he is...

03:05.667 --> 03:07.041
I understand.

03:07.083 --> 03:10.667
Uh, if my son were a criminal,
I'd be embarrassed too.

03:11.083 --> 03:13.125
I didn't say
I was embarrassed.

03:13.166 --> 03:15.500
Jung is good boy now.
Very different.

03:15.542 --> 03:17.542
So invite him to the bazaar.

03:18.375 --> 03:21.041
-He's so busy with work.
-Of course.

03:21.083 --> 03:23.125
-Well, so much work to do.
-Mmm.

leave in an hour.

03:53.542 --> 03:55.125

have a lab assignment.

03:55.166 --> 03:56.166
Okay. No problem.

03:57.417 --> 04:00.667
(LAUGHING)
Look, we just sell out.

04:01.333 --> 04:04.166
Why don't you just say,
"One Can, One Dollar?"

04:04.208 --> 04:07.250
Because I am
a smart business man,
huh?

04:07.291 --> 04:08.959
People get excite about two.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.041
It's like two for one
but two for two.

04:12.083 --> 04:15.625
Look at proof.
We sell five whole
case ravioli.

04:15.667 --> 04:17.333
Yeah.
We didn't sell out.
I took them down.

04:17.834 --> 04:19.500
-What you talking?
-They're expired.

04:19.542 --> 04:22.417
I know.
Why you think
I get good deal?

04:22.458 --> 04:23.917
Appa,
you can't sell
expired food.

04:23.959 --> 04:27.250
Ah, you right,
let's just give away
for free, huh?

04:27.291 --> 04:29.375
That a good business idea.

04:29.417 --> 04:30.792
-Don't you know...
-Please, don't say it...

04:30.834 --> 04:34.083
Expiration date
is a marketing conspiracy!

04:34.125 --> 04:35.166
Look.

04:35.959 --> 04:39.166
It say
"best before this date."

04:39.208 --> 04:43.000
After this date, not best,
but still pretty good.

04:43.041 --> 04:45.375
It's meat, Appa.
Meat goes bad.

04:45.417 --> 04:47.083
You go bad.

04:47.125 --> 04:49.417
If someone buys your ravioli
and gets sick,
you could get sued.

04:49.458 --> 04:51.750
-That would be bad.
-Ah, you don't know
what you talking.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.834
MR. CHIN:
Be careful, Mr. Kim.

04:53.875 --> 04:57.709
In restaurant business,
you serve one bad dumpling,
you get lawsuit up the wazoo.

04:57.750 --> 05:00.083
Hmm.
You probably right.

05:00.125 --> 05:02.959
Really? 'Cause I literally
just said the same thing.

05:03.000 --> 05:07.250
Janet,
God give to you two ear,
and one mouth,

05:07.291 --> 05:09.458
listen two more times
than you talking.

05:09.500 --> 05:11.417
-But I'm the one who said...
-Stop.

05:12.375 --> 05:14.500
-Listen.
-Listen.

05:16.125 --> 05:19.750
-Can't you just admit that...
-Shh, listen.

05:22.375 --> 05:25.125
So you agree with me
that the ravioli is bad.

05:25.166 --> 05:28.709
No.
I agree with Mr. Chin,
that I can't sell.

05:28.959 --> 05:31.333
But I can eat.
See?

05:34.250 --> 05:35.250
Fork!

05:44.166 --> 05:45.166
Mmm.

05:45.417 --> 05:48.875
-Tastes good cold?
-Shh.

05:48.917 --> 05:50.333
Listen.

06:03.291 --> 06:04.792
(SLURPING)

06:12.333 --> 06:15.208
Mrs. Kim,
I thought your family
couldn't make it today.

06:15.250 --> 06:18.375
Yeah, Janet is study
and I talk to Jung,

06:18.417 --> 06:19.542
he wants to come and help,

06:19.583 --> 06:22.250
but he is manager now,
so he is too busy.

06:23.333 --> 06:25.041
He doesn't look
too busy to me.

06:30.667 --> 06:32.333
-Jung.
-Hi, Umma.

06:32.375 --> 06:34.625
-Pastor Nina.
-Oh. Hi, Mrs. Kim.

06:34.667 --> 06:37.333
-You meet my son?
-Yes, he's been very helpful.

06:37.375 --> 06:39.709
-Where have you
been keeping him?
-Oh, you didn't know?

06:39.750 --> 06:41.875
-Jung's been...
-Jung has never been in jail!

06:43.291 --> 06:46.291
I was going to say,
managing a car rental agency.

06:46.333 --> 06:48.542
Actually, I'm just
an assistant manager.

06:48.583 --> 06:50.875
-Sounds impressive.
-Is very impressive.

06:50.917 --> 06:55.000
Especially since it wasn't
that long ago that Jung was in
a juvenile detention centre.

06:55.542 --> 06:57.291
Oh, so you're
a trouble maker,
huh?

06:57.333 --> 07:00.083
Not any more.
I'm on the straight
and narrow, Nina.

07:01.125 --> 07:02.250
Pastor Nina.

07:02.291 --> 07:04.458
Well, the Bible is full
of trouble makers.

07:04.500 --> 07:06.583
Yeah, even Jesus
was trouble make.

07:08.041 --> 07:12.208
I'm aiming for something
between Jesus and juvie.

07:12.625 --> 07:15.291
I think I just found
the title of my next sermon.

07:15.709 --> 07:17.375
-It's good to meet you, Jung.
-Likewise.

07:17.917 --> 07:19.208
Excuse.

07:21.667 --> 07:23.250
Why you don't tell to me
you is coming?

07:23.291 --> 07:24.542
I didn't even know
I was coming.

07:24.583 --> 07:26.000
Kimchee's Umma
asked him to help.

07:26.041 --> 07:27.333
He couldn't,
so I came.

07:27.375 --> 07:29.417
Okay.
You come, you help,
that's very good.

07:29.458 --> 07:31.583
-Thank you.
Say hi to Kimchee.
-What's the hurry?

07:31.625 --> 07:32.709
It's kind of nice
being back.

cooler than Janet was.

Maybe you need
to take a break.

09:03.125 --> 09:06.208
Oh, no, he can't do that,
because then he'd have to
admit the ravioli was bad.

09:06.250 --> 09:08.166
-The ravioli is bad?
-Not that ravioli.

09:08.208 --> 09:10.250
-Other ravioli.
-So you admit it was bad.

09:10.291 --> 09:13.667
Not bad. Just not best.

Mrs. Kim, I wanted
to talk to you about Jung,
if that's okay.

11:24.959 --> 11:27.125
Don't worry,
I take care of everything.

11:27.166 --> 11:28.917
I haven't asked you
anything yet.

11:28.959 --> 11:31.041
Don't have to, I was there.
I see everything.

11:31.417 --> 11:32.917
What did you see?

11:32.959 --> 11:35.083
-What you think I see?
-I didn't know
you saw anything.

11:35.125 --> 11:36.959
Then why you ask what I see?

11:37.000 --> 11:38.291
Because you said
you saw something.

11:38.333 --> 11:40.792
No, I think you say
that to me.

11:42.959 --> 11:45.667
I was just wanted
to ask you if you think

11:45.709 --> 11:47.959
Jung would be interested
in mentoring some
of the youth group.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.750
The kids seem
to really like him.

11:49.792 --> 11:50.959
Oh.

11:52.125 --> 11:55.959
-So, what do you think?
-Jung is a good boy,

11:56.000 --> 11:57.834
but I don't think youth
should look up to him.

11:57.875 --> 12:00.959
Not look down at him,
but maybe just look
straight at him.

12:01.000 --> 12:01.834
You understand?

12:03.458 --> 12:06.333
Not really,
but if you could ask him,
that would be great.

12:06.375 --> 12:08.667
Yeah,
but answer is
probably no.

12:09.333 --> 12:11.417

Well, I'm...

You're the one
who locked me
in that room.

nothing is a big deal.

-I didn't do anything.
-It's never your fault.

I tell Mrs. Park every time,

14:06.750 --> 14:09.041
"He's a good boy now,
so different."

14:09.083 --> 14:10.667

you walked away
