MENELAUS: Where is she?
<i>—</i> HERMIONE: I told you.

00:03.280 --> 00:04.395
He's taken her.

00:05.520 --> 00:06.954
That's not possible!

00:07.240 --> 00:08.435
Get a message to my brother.

00:08.800 --> 00:13.476
The king sacrificed his own daughter
to appease the gods in coming here.

00:13.560 --> 00:15.312
Where is my wife?

00:15.400 --> 00:16.913
She doesn't want to go back.

00:17.000 --> 00:19.514
MENELAUS:
We will bring the rage of the gods down

00:19.600 --> 00:21.352
on your Asiatic heads!

00:21.840 --> 00:23.717
What is worth fighting for?

00:23.880 --> 00:24.870
ODYSSEUS:
He's agreed.

00:25.120 --> 00:26.394
Surround the city.

ARROW PIERCES FLESH

01:17.080 --> 01:18.718
SOLDIERS CRY OUT

01:25.280 --> 01:27.157
PRIAM:
Since the Greeks changed strategy

01:27.240 --> 01:30.551
we've found it impossible to keep
trade routes open to the city.

01:32.280 --> 01:33.679
For almost a year

01:34.640 --> 01:38.429
the siege has prevented us from
farming our lands outside the walls.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.399
Our crops have been ruined

01:40.760 --> 01:43.434
supplies have been seized,
fishing vessels plundered.

01:44.920 --> 01:46.593
They tried to beat us in battle

01:47.680 --> 01:48.715
and they failed.

01:49.880 --> 01:51.518
Now they hem us in.

01:52.320 --> 01:53.640
I've therefore no choice

01:54.280 --> 01:56.430
but to implement rationing
on the whole city.

01:57.360 --> 01:58.395
It will begin tomorrow.

01:59.560 --> 02:01.915
The granaries will be patrolled
by our soldiers

02:02.280 --> 02:04.715
and grain distributed only
by royal decree.

02:06.800 --> 02:08.871
This is a proud city.

02:09.840 --> 02:12.798
And we are a people of great courage,
but...

02:13.720 --> 02:15.552
the glory of war is over.

02:18.080 --> 02:19.798
The hard graft starts now.

02:30.280 --> 02:33.159
Father, can we make
an exception to the men

02:33.200 --> 02:34.838
opening up the underground waterways?

02:35.280 --> 02:36.793
They're working day and night.

02:36.880 --> 02:38.154
PRIAM:
No exceptions.

02:38.640 --> 02:40.597
Change the shifts more often
if necessary

02:40.680 --> 02:42.273
but the same rule applies for all.

02:43.280 --> 02:44.679
How far have the men dug?

02:44.720 --> 02:47.280
We've reached halfway
to the caves at Charos Bay

02:47.320 --> 02:49.277
but it is going to take months more
to complete.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.195
Will the food last that long?

02:51.280 --> 02:52.998
If we are stringent in our enforcement.

02:54.040 --> 02:57.078
Anyone caught stealing must suffer
the severest punishment

02:57.200 --> 02:58.474
in order to deter the others.

02:58.560 --> 03:00.437
What about the palace's own stores?

03:02.080 --> 03:03.150
Can't we share them?

03:04.720 --> 03:06.233
I'm happy to have no more
than any citizen...

03:06.320 --> 03:07.469
How very kind of you, madam.

03:08.480 --> 03:10.710
However, a city needs its leaders
to be fit and well.

03:11.120 --> 03:12.349
What the city needs is grain.

03:12.720 --> 03:14.313
PANDARUS:
Trojans are a tough people.

03:14.600 --> 03:16.079
They will understand our position.

03:16.160 --> 03:18.071
We won't be holding any wedding banquets,
I can assure you.

03:18.160 --> 03:19.116
What does that mean?

03:19.440 --> 03:21.477
We didn't ask for any wedding...
<i>—</i> That's enough.

03:22.800 --> 03:25.155
Why is a slow death any better
than a fast one?

03:27.640 --> 03:30.314
If we are to die,
I'd prefer to do so with honour.

03:31.920 --> 03:32.955
Resisting.

03:33.240 --> 03:37.154
Odysseus is strangling the life out of us
to provoke a reaction.

03:38.040 --> 03:40.156
I'm not going to fall for it
and lose more men.

03:41.960 --> 03:45.078
If we open up the waterways,
we create a supply line.

03:45.120 --> 03:47.589
By the time those tunnels are ready

03:47.640 --> 03:49.597
there'|| only be corpses left to use them.

04:41.320 --> 04:42.515
Just ignore him.

04:44.120 --> 04:45.110
And Andromache?

04:46.880 --> 04:48.632
Why does she still treat me like an enemy?

04:50.280 --> 04:51.793
Andromache's like her father.

04:52.680 --> 04:53.511
A bit stubborn.

04:54.600 --> 04:55.510
She'll come round.

04:56.560 --> 04:57.709
I wouldn't worry about it.

05:01.880 --> 05:03.871
HECUBA:
You know you shouldn't blame yourself.

05:04.400 --> 05:05.959
What do you mean?

05:06.840 --> 05:08.797
Well, maybe you think if you'd gone back
to the Greeks

05:08.840 --> 05:10.877
when you had the chance
they'd have all gone home.

05:12.320 --> 05:14.470
Wouldn't they?
<i>—</i> Oh, no, my dear.

05:15.200 --> 05:17.237
They would have stuck you
in Menelaus's tent

05:17.280 --> 05:18.793
for his pleasure and revenge

05:18.840 --> 05:21.150
and carried on doing exactly
what they're doing now.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.152
Trust me, you're not the first foreign bride
to come into this city.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.798
Trojans make you earn their respect.

05:31.960 --> 05:32.870
But once you have it

05:33.640 --> 05:34.710
it's yours for life.

You can leave now.

05:50.000 --> 05:50.831
All of you.

05:51.720 --> 05:52.835
I will wash my husband.

06:01.160 --> 06:02.639
Pretty, that little one, isn't she?

06:10.320 --> 06:12.197
You can drag the boy out of the dirt...

06:12.960 --> 06:14.155
I had to do something.

06:16.360 --> 06:17.794
I can't just stand around all day.

06:44.040 --> 06:46.077
Looks like I've dragged you
into the dirt with me.

06:47.440 --> 06:48.271
Oh, no.

06:49.880 --> 06:51.279
I chose to come.

07:19.320 --> 07:20.515
How can people live on that?

07:21.240 --> 07:22.674
People are tougher than you think.

07:23.320 --> 07:24.355
I hate the Greeks.

07:25.400 --> 07:26.390
Yeah, me too.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.479
I was only supposed to be here a week.

07:39.600 --> 07:41.159
Will you share your ration with Keno?

07:41.920 --> 07:42.910
I'd better do, hadn't I?

08:15.160 --> 08:16.514
But we did everything you said.

08:19.680 --> 08:20.590
It will happen.

We will make offerings.

PARIS SIGHS

09:06.480 --> 09:07.311
What's going on?

09:07.400 --> 09:09.357
Do you know the hills
between here and Cilicia?

09:09.880 --> 09:12.156
I grew up there.
<i>—</i> So you know the smaller paths?

09:12.440 --> 09:14.113
Erm, sure. Why?

09:14.200 --> 09:15.599
I need you to come with me.

09:16.200 --> 09:17.679
We're riding out there tonight.

09:17.760 --> 09:20.195
How can Cilicia help us?
<i>—</i> Get dressed and meet me outside.

09:21.280 --> 09:22.350
I thought you didn't trust me.

09:24.720 --> 09:25.551
I don't.

09:28.920 --> 09:32.072
No, it's too dangerous.
<i>—</i> We'll go under cover of darkness.

09:32.200 --> 09:35.511
Four men...
<i>—</i> The Greeks control the plains and the sea.

09:35.600 --> 09:38.638
They have camps in the forest beyond...
<i>—</i> So we'll take the mountain paths.

09:38.880 --> 09:39.836
Alexander can lead us.

09:43.440 --> 09:45.477
The Greeks don't know the hills
like I do.

09:46.360 --> 09:49.751
If I can reach Cilicia,
I can ask Andromache's father to help us.

09:50.680 --> 09:52.830
He can open up the waterways
from the sea caves at Charos

09:52.920 --> 09:54.752
while we do the same from this end.

09:56.120 --> 09:57.519
Digging from both sides.

09:58.040 --> 10:00.919
We can have a supply line up and running
in half the time.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.435
We can get in grain, animals,
even weapons.

10:03.520 --> 10:04.669

What did you always say to me?

10:10.640 --> 10:12.950
It's better to die on one's feet
than live on one's knees.

10:20.960 --> 10:21.916
Hm.

10:27.320 --> 10:28.879
Are you sure about this?

10:35.560 --> 10:36.391
It's a mistake.

10:36.600 --> 10:38.557
Alexander knows the routes
better than anyone.

10:38.640 --> 10:40.313
But can you rely on him?
<i>—</i> I don't know.

10:43.160 --> 10:44.958
But I intend to have a child with you
one day.

10:46.160 --> 10:47.434
And it is going to need feeding.

10:55.080 --> 10:56.514
Tell my father I love him.

11:00.800 --> 11:02.199
It's only three days.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.479
It was arranged by our fathers.

20:12.800 --> 20:14.518
Cilicia is an important ally, so...

20:15.920 --> 20:18.355
My father wanted that connection.
<i>—</i> A political marriage?

20:21.200 --> 20:22.156
Political alliance.

20:23.360 --> 20:24.270
A marriage of love.

20:26.360 --> 20:30.035
Love doesn't need to involve
stealing someone away in a chest.

20:31.080 --> 20:33.799
It can be a...
formal exchange of vows.

20:34.520 --> 20:36.431
Two cities and two families
joined together.

20:37.520 --> 20:38.351
Sure.

20:39.080 --> 20:42.596
Alexander, your love
got us into this trouble.

20:42.680 --> 20:44.273
Mine might just get us out of it.

20:47.280 --> 20:49.032
The sun's dropping. We need to go.

20:57.880 --> 21:01.589
WHISPERING ETHEREAL VOICES

21:18.400 --> 21:21.233
It's important that we continue
to monitor supplies.

21:21.360 --> 21:22.998
But the tunnel workers are suffering.

21:23.080 --> 21:24.753
I'm not sure how long
we can continue digging...

21:24.840 --> 21:27.798
We are hoping that the stringent rationing
will only be required for a matter of...

21:27.880 --> 21:29.154
Please. May I speak?

21:31.160 --> 21:32.036
What is it?

21:32.080 --> 21:34.310
It's about the palace grain stores.

21:36.080 --> 21:37.559
I want to give the city my share.

21:37.600 --> 21:40.069
Madam, it has already been discussed.

21:40.120 --> 21:41.440
Not to my satisfaction.

21:43.080 --> 21:44.070
My lord.

21:45.240 --> 21:48.392
There was a crop failure
one year in Sparta when I was a child.

21:49.520 --> 21:51.670
I asked my father what he was going to do.

21:53.000 --> 21:56.231
He told me,
'There are two types of royal family.

21:57.880 --> 22:01.111
Ones, that in time of famine,
put an extra lock on the palace doors...

22:02.560 --> 22:03.959
and the ones who open them up.'

22:06.720 --> 22:07.994
I'll be giving out my share.

22:09.720 --> 22:12.030
What you do is your choice.

22:12.800 --> 22:15.838
CROWD WHISPERS

22:24.200 --> 22:25.952
Please. My lady.

22:26.440 --> 22:28.556
Please. Please.

22:33.120 --> 22:34.155
KNOCK ON DOOR

22:48.640 --> 22:49.710
Samira.

22:50.080 --> 22:52.276
This is...
<i>—</i> I know who it is.

22:55.200 --> 22:57.271
ODYSSEUS:
I told him to get himself inside the city

22:57.360 --> 22:58.873
in case negotiations failed

22:59.360 --> 23:00.998
to send me the dog when the time is right.

23:02.640 --> 23:04.199
I wasn't sure he made it until now.

23:06.360 --> 23:07.430
Typical Odysseus.

23:08.760 --> 23:10.398
Always a contingency plan.

23:10.440 --> 23:11.794
Can you trust him?

23:12.320 --> 23:14.960
Xanthius has served me
since he was a child.

23:15.840 --> 23:17.069
A loner.

23:17.120 --> 23:19.077
Prefers the company of dogs to man.

23:19.680 --> 23:22.069
Says they're more loyal.
<i>—</i> He has a point.

23:22.120 --> 23:24.589
Yes, Patroclus. I trust him.

23:25.320 --> 23:26.549
So what now?

23:27.280 --> 23:28.634
You're the one who gets things done.

23:30.040 --> 23:31.951
ODYSSEUS:
Menelaus wants his wife back.

23:32.000 --> 23:33.638
I'll get you into the city.

23:33.680 --> 23:35.239
The rest is up to you.

23:40.280 --> 23:42.317
Minoa says you helped
Queen Hecuba give birth.

23:42.920 --> 23:48.233
I brought your husband, Princess Cassandra
and the Prince Alexander into the world.

23:50.000 --> 23:51.320
Did Hector come easily?

23:51.600 --> 23:53.557
Couldn't wait to make his mark.

23:54.840 --> 23:57.480
Alexander's was
a much more difficult birth.

23:57.520 --> 23:59.079
W-What do you mean?

24:01.160 --> 24:02.798
Is it true what they say?

24:03.440 --> 24:05.113
He has returned?

24:05.960 --> 24:07.439
Yes.

24:07.920 --> 24:10.150
He was the last baby I ever delivered.

24:11.800 --> 24:12.870
Why?

24:15.080 --> 24:16.275
Ask the queen.

24:33.840 --> 24:38.391
MEN SHOUT IN DISTANCE

24:41.160 --> 24:42.594
We'll have to take the higher pass.

24:43.640 --> 24:44.675
Ifslongen

24:45.480 --> 24:47.278
But you avoid being seen from the north.

25:12.560 --> 25:15.757
CONGREGATION CHANT: Apollo, giver of truth
and light, hear our prayers.

25:19.720 --> 25:23.634
Apollo, giver of truth and light,
hear our prayers.

25:24.360 --> 25:26.749
Great Apollo, hear our prayers.

25:26.840 --> 25:31.391
Apollo, giver of truth and light,
hear our prayers.

25:32.080 --> 25:34.799
CONGREGATION:
Apollo, giver of truth and light...

25:34.880 --> 25:36.439
HECTOR: Woah.
<i>—</i> Hector.

25:40.080 --> 25:41.195
HECTOR:
Eetion.

25:53.000 --> 25:54.274
Sorry we couldn't send word.

25:54.440 --> 25:56.750
EETION: How is my daughter?
<i>—</i> HECTOR: She misses you.

25:56.840 --> 25:59.514
I've been terribly worried.
I think of her every day.

26:01.600 --> 26:02.431
And this is?

26:03.280 --> 26:04.759
Alexander, my brother.

26:05.520 --> 26:07.033
My daughter's told me all about you.

26:08.080 --> 26:10.754
Brought up in these hills, weren't you?
<i>—</i> Yes.

26:10.800 --> 26:12.473
You must wish you'd never left.

26:16.280 --> 26:17.270
EETION: How's the city?

26:17.920 --> 26:19.399
HECTOR: We're running short
on grain and oil.

26:19.440 --> 26:22.034
People are starting to slaughter
their work animals.

26:22.320 --> 26:24.675
All our efforts to send in food
have failed. Every one.

26:27.320 --> 26:30.312
We're opening up
the underground waterways.

26:31.480 --> 26:34.757
If we can dig from both sides in...
two months

26:34.800 --> 26:36.359
we'll have a supply line from the sea.

26:36.400 --> 26:39.870
We can stay in Troy until the Greeks
finally lose patience and leave.

26:40.520 --> 26:42.079
What do you need?
<i>—</i> Men.

26:42.880 --> 26:44.712
Digging from the caves at Charos, but...

26:45.880 --> 26:47.234
the work's dangerous.

26:47.280 --> 26:49.191
My daughter is trapped in Troy.

26:49.240 --> 26:51.117
You'll find no shortage
of volunteers here.

26:53.280 --> 26:56.079
Come to town. Eat, rest.

26:57.120 --> 27:00.033
High priest Chryses,
bless these men.

27:02.120 --> 27:02.951
Both of them.

27:11.840 --> 27:14.434
HIGH PRIEST CHRYSES:
May Apollo bless you

27:14.480 --> 27:17.552
and reward your courage,
that we may come together

27:17.600 --> 27:18.920
in these times of trouble...

27:25.560 --> 27:26.994
SOLDIER:
Wait. Just wait.

27:29.040 --> 27:29.950
SOLDIER:
Stand back.

27:34.520 --> 27:36.750
The palace share their own grain
with you all today.

27:38.360 --> 27:39.191
When we suffer...

27:40.200 --> 27:41.315
we suffer together.

27:41.440 --> 27:44.717
INDISTINCT CHATTER

28:01.840 --> 28:03.114
It's alright.

28:08.480 --> 28:09.629
I know what you're thinking.

28:11.840 --> 28:13.035
Helen of Sparta...

28:14.680 --> 28:17.832
is the reason Troy
is in the trouble it's in.

28:19.840 --> 28:21.194
I think it too.

28:23.040 --> 28:24.553
Every day.

28:30.240 --> 28:31.469
What you did was brave.

28:33.000 --> 28:34.320
You're not Helen of Sparta.

28:34.960 --> 28:36.109
You are Helen of Troy.

28:49.880 --> 28:51.632
WOMEN IN CROWD:
Thank you.

29:05.000 --> 29:05.831
MAN:
Thank you.

29:07.760 --> 29:08.591
WOMAN:
Thank you.

29:08.680 --> 29:10.910
I hope this helps.
<i>—</i> Thank you.

29:12.840 --> 29:14.797
For you. There's more.

29:16.920 --> 29:17.751
I hope this helps.

29:18.960 --> 29:21.793
INDISTINCT CHATTER

29:26.520 --> 29:27.715
People like her, don't they?

29:29.200 --> 29:30.270
She's got a popular touch.

29:32.560 --> 29:33.675
HECUBA SIGHS

29:34.640 --> 29:36.358
HECUBA:
We're all fighting together.

29:37.720 --> 29:39.791
Maybe I can't convince you to like her

29:39.840 --> 29:41.751
but I want you on her side.

29:43.760 --> 29:44.830
We are at war.

29:45.920 --> 29:48.116
The Greeks are strangling this city.

29:49.120 --> 29:51.270
Two of my sons could be dead
for all I know.

29:51.360 --> 29:54.432
We can't afford to have another war
inside this family.

29:56.520 --> 29:57.749
Do you understand?

30:00.360 --> 30:01.395
I will be kinder to her.

30:01.960 --> 30:03.314
Thank you.

30:07.960 --> 30:09.473
Helen's not the only one struggling.

30:11.400 --> 30:12.674
I know.

30:16.080 --> 30:17.275
I wanted a second opinion.

30:19.800 --> 30:23.191
Minoa took me to see a woman
in the lower city.

30:23.600 --> 30:25.273
Her name's Samira.

30:27.040 --> 30:28.678
And I wanted to ask you, is she any good?

30:28.720 --> 30:31.678
It's just that you dismissed her, I think.

30:31.720 --> 30:33.677
After Alexander was born?

30:35.360 --> 30:36.680
Yes, we did.

30:38.440 --> 30:41.000
Oh, she was completely incompetent.

30:41.040 --> 30:42.075
I nearly died.

30:42.880 --> 30:44.359
And so did Alexander.

30:45.520 --> 30:46.999
You shouldn't use her.

30:49.120 --> 30:50.315
I'm sorry.

30:57.400 --> 30:58.879
FLY BUZZES

31:10.480 --> 31:11.550
Agamemnon.

31:18.200 --> 31:20.476
When they get her back,
what do you plan to do with her?

31:27.400 --> 31:30.631
Whatever you decide to do,
I lost my daughter because of her.

31:35.240 --> 31:36.753
She needs to answer to me, too.

31:42.320 --> 31:43.151
Hector.

31:44.360 --> 31:45.395
Can I tell you something?

31:49.600 --> 31:50.999
When I was a shepherd

31:52.720 --> 31:53.755
Aphrodite came to me...

31:56.400 --> 31:57.231
in a vision.

32:02.960 --> 32:05.429
She said I'd have
the most beautiful woman in the world.

32:07.280 --> 32:09.669
We've all had that dream.
<i>—</i> But mine came true.

32:11.800 --> 32:13.029
Helen is that woman.

32:14.400 --> 32:16.391
That's why I did what I did.

32:18.000 --> 32:19.149
I am blessed by the gods.

32:20.440 --> 32:21.510
You really believe that?

32:22.120 --> 32:22.951
Yes.

32:25.120 --> 32:25.951
I do.

33:12.960 --> 33:13.836
Litos.

33:21.400 --> 33:23.038
No need for formalities.

33:23.560 --> 33:25.312
I'm not your high priest anymore.

33:28.280 --> 33:29.554
I hear Troy suffers.

33:31.520 --> 33:32.840
It's why we came.

33:33.840 --> 33:35.717
I pray in this temple every day.

33:37.080 --> 33:38.434
Make offerings to your city...

33:40.520 --> 33:41.749
that it may be protected.

33:51.160 --> 33:52.639
You were lucky to leave when you did.

33:53.240 --> 33:54.071
Lucky?

33:57.040 --> 33:58.553
Did they tell you why I left?

33:59.480 --> 34:02.552
My father said you'd come to seek
closeness to Apollo in your later years.

34:03.280 --> 34:04.111
That's good.

34:08.800 --> 34:10.632
Why didn't you acknowledge me
when we arrived?

34:12.360 --> 34:13.190
Your brother...

34:14.520 --> 34:15.635
why is he with you?

34:16.920 --> 34:19.480
He knows the land,
smaller paths.

34:19.560 --> 34:20.630
So he's going back with you?

34:20.679 --> 34:22.876
Yes. Of course.
<i>—</i> He mustn't.

34:23.960 --> 34:27.429
Your brother must not return to Troy,
Hector.

34:28.920 --> 34:30.831
I speak with the authority of the gods.

34:31.760 --> 34:33.433
Don't make the mistake your father made.

34:34.120 --> 34:36.031
He must not go back.

34:36.080 --> 34:37.797
I don't understand what you're saying.

34:44.520 --> 34:45.351
Choose one.

34:47.560 --> 34:48.391
Choose.

35:14.480 --> 35:17.438
This is what happened at his birth

35:18.200 --> 35:20.919
and every day since he returned.

35:21.600 --> 35:23.511
The blood runs black

35:23.880 --> 35:25.712
and you know what that means.

35:27.040 --> 35:28.872
Your father defied the gods.

35:29.360 --> 35:31.271
You must obey them.

35:32.000 --> 35:35.311
Make sure he never gets back to the city.

35:35.720 --> 35:38.519
What do you mean?
<i>—</i> I mean stop him...

35:39.960 --> 35:41.394
any way you can.

35:53.280 --> 35:54.190
Aphrodite...

35:55.920 --> 35:56.990
if you did choose me

35:58.920 --> 36:00.069
protect Paris now.

36:02.040 --> 36:03.599
Give him the caution he lacks.

36:05.120 --> 36:06.394
Bring him home.

36:19.040 --> 36:20.030
KNOCK ON DOOR

36:27.720 --> 36:28.551
Come in.

36:33.960 --> 36:34.791
HELEN:
Andromache.

36:37.000 --> 36:38.798
We're both waiting for our men to return.

36:40.640 --> 36:42.916
I thought it might help
if we waited together.

36:51.400 --> 36:52.390
Time to go.

36:55.840 --> 36:56.910
Eetion, erm...

36:57.920 --> 37:00.514
when they get to the cave,
the channel they make in the rock

37:00.560 --> 37:02.392
needs to be wide enough
to take mules and carts.

37:02.440 --> 37:04.954
Plus they'll be digging
Against the stream, so it won't be easy.

37:05.000 --> 37:06.229
We'll manage.

37:06.760 --> 37:08.558
Who's this?
— EETION SIGHS

37:08.600 --> 37:09.829
Shepherd's daughter.

37:10.600 --> 37:12.113
Trust me, she won't let you down.

37:13.400 --> 37:15.869
Then we'll see you soon.
Under the earth.

37:18.360 --> 37:22.399
Take this back with you.
It's a gift from our people.

37:22.440 --> 37:23.669
EETION:
First of many.

37:27.240 --> 37:29.436
Kiss my daughter.
Tell her I'll see her soon.

37:33.920 --> 37:34.830
Good bye, Alexander.

37:35.440 --> 37:36.555
May the gods be with you.

37:38.120 --> 37:39.110
He's a good horse.

37:40.040 --> 37:41.713
Look after him better than the last one.

37:56.160 --> 37:58.674
What is it?
<i>—</i> Fortified wine.

38:00.120 --> 38:01.599
One of my women used to make it for me.

38:02.800 --> 38:04.632
It worked when I was trying
to conceive.

38:06.120 --> 38:07.633
At least, may have helped.

38:09.160 --> 38:09.991
I don't know.

38:12.320 --> 38:13.913
I promise it won't do any harm.

38:16.600 --> 38:17.670
When I was in Sparta

38:18.760 --> 38:19.989
all my company was female.

38:23.120 --> 38:24.633
I miss women's friendship.

38:26.920 --> 38:27.876
What about you?

38:29.360 --> 38:30.191
Me?

38:31.600 --> 38:32.431
Oh.

38:32.720 --> 38:34.711
My husband is the only friend I need.

38:35.560 --> 38:36.595
You're lucky.

38:37.400 --> 38:38.595
Not many wives can say that.

38:44.600 --> 38:45.749
Tell me about your daughter.

38:47.120 --> 38:49.475
What about her?
<i>—</i> What's she like?

38:54.520 --> 38:55.715
She was always more like...

38:56.880 --> 38:57.711
her father...

38:59.000 --> 38:59.831
than me.

39:01.840 --> 39:03.433
Intelligent and sharp...

39:05.760 --> 39:07.398
I could never find my way through to her.

39:08.480 --> 39:10.153
You speak of her in the past tense.

39:10.240 --> 39:11.674
It's how I feel, I suppose.

39:15.240 --> 39:17.231
I had Hermione very young.

39:19.560 --> 39:20.834
14 years old.

39:22.640 --> 39:23.630
I wasn't really ready.

39:26.000 --> 39:27.035
The truth is...

39:28.280 --> 39:29.918
Hermione will be happier without me.

39:31.200 --> 39:32.235
I don't believe that.

39:32.920 --> 39:34.911
Not all women are designed for motherhood.

39:37.920 --> 39:41.038
How can you say that?
<i>—</i> I know it must seem ungrateful.

39:41.920 --> 39:45.276
But I never found it easy
to be a mother.

39:46.360 --> 39:47.759
Maybe with another man, it...

39:49.000 --> 39:50.149
would have been different.

39:51.280 --> 39:52.509
Maybe one day it will be.

39:54.360 --> 39:55.350
I truly hope...

39:57.560 --> 39:58.630
you get what you desire.

40:07.400 --> 40:10.631
Now I know why Alexander
fell in love so quickly.

40:11.440 --> 40:12.635
What do you mean?

40:12.680 --> 40:14.751
I don't know. You have a...

40:14.800 --> 40:16.552
Please don't say beauty.
<i>—</i> No.

40:17.680 --> 40:18.795
You have a charm.

40:21.400 --> 40:23.755
I pity Menelaus.
<i>—</i> Why?

40:23.800 --> 40:25.552
How unhappy he must have been
trying to hold onto you.

40:25.600 --> 40:27.318
I didn't want to hurt him.

40:27.360 --> 40:29.431
I'm sure you never do.
<i>—</i> What do you mean?

40:30.320 --> 40:31.879
You can try all you like.

40:32.760 --> 40:35.320
Smile, give out grain, win their hearts.

40:36.560 --> 40:38.517
But deep down,
you know you don't belong here.

40:40.040 --> 40:41.678
Thank you for the wine.

41:12.440 --> 41:13.953
PATROCLUS:
Odysseus says it's time.

41:15.720 --> 41:17.074
He wants to know if you're ready.

41:20.200 --> 41:21.235
Achilles.

41:23.760 --> 41:25.876
What do you think the sea makes of it all,
Patroclus?

41:29.400 --> 41:32.074
We come here, we fight,
we bleed

41:32.880 --> 41:33.790
patch up

41:35.280 --> 41:36.395
fight again.

41:37.200 --> 41:38.429
To us it's everything, right?

41:40.000 --> 41:41.399
But to the sea...

41:54.120 --> 41:55.110
Yes, I'm ready.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.389
When do we move?
<i>—</i> When I'm sure it's safe.

42:10.680 --> 42:11.875
We'll need to ride fast.

42:12.280 --> 42:13.395
Don't you worry about that.

42:16.920 --> 42:17.751
Hector.

42:19.240 --> 42:20.753
In case we don't make it...

42:22.320 --> 42:24.516
I never meant to bring dishonour
to our city.

42:26.200 --> 42:28.111
I fell in love, that's all.

42:30.080 --> 42:31.434
Troy is my home now

42:32.560 --> 42:34.039
and I'd do anything for it to be free.

42:36.200 --> 42:37.918
What if you can never see Helen again?

42:40.240 --> 42:41.639
Anything except that.

42:46.720 --> 42:48.552
I've made a mess of everything,
haven't I?

42:50.000 --> 42:52.037
If the goddess really did come to you,
then...

42:54.480 --> 42:55.311
she'll protect you.

42:56.720 --> 42:57.551
You think so?

43:03.720 --> 43:05.916
They're still not back?
<i>—</i> Not yet.

43:07.040 --> 43:08.155
Can't you send someone out?

43:08.200 --> 43:09.520
I wish we could.

43:12.160 --> 43:13.389
Congratulations.

43:14.600 --> 43:16.113
Your gesture to the city was...

43:16.160 --> 43:17.673
clearly appreciated.

43:18.960 --> 43:20.439
I just did what I felt was right.

43:21.080 --> 43:22.753
Oh, you underestimate yourself.

43:24.280 --> 43:26.749
You have become the city's
cause and totem...

43:28.080 --> 43:29.036
in one day.

43:30.000 --> 43:31.957
It takes more than a pretty face
to win a war.

43:32.000 --> 43:34.071
But not to start it, apparently.

You're even dressing like them now.

48:45.800 --> 48:46.949
You too...

48:48.560 --> 48:49.391
my lord.

48:49.480 --> 48:51.869
So I hear one husband isn't enough
for you.

48:54.320 --> 48:56.834
You should have told me
Menelaus wasn't satisfying you.

48:58.160 --> 48:59.514
I would have willingly obliged.

49:00.560 --> 49:03.552
I mean, if you're going to sleep around,
at least choose a real man...

Menelaus won the day.

49:15.960 --> 49:17.837
And then he gave you
to his little brother.

49:17.880 --> 49:20.076
How flattering it is
to be passed among men.

49:20.120 --> 49:21.269
Yeah.

Now here I am.

Hmm?

49:36.920 --> 49:39.480
He's here in the palace.

49:40.240 --> 49:42.834
And when he finds you here,
he will kill you.

49:45.360 --> 49:47.317
I think we both doubt that.

49:50.320 --> 49:51.594
That's if he's here at all.

49:54.640 --> 49:55.675
How could he have left?

49:57.080 --> 49:58.275
You've surrounded the city.

49:59.880 --> 50:01.917
Rats always find a way of getting out.

LyCia?

50:17.040 --> 50:17.950

I told you.

Yeah.

50:27.520 --> 50:28.351
He's here.

50:29.720 --> 50:30.551
In Troy.

50:33.320 --> 50:35.152

50:59.040 --> 51:00.189
He's returning.

51:01.200 --> 51:02.110
Mustn't!

51:07.080 --> 51:08.832
It's them! Open the gates!

51:21.400 --> 51:23.232
No sound.

51:24.520 --> 51:26.557
We are going to walk together

51:27.400 --> 51:28.310
down those steps

51:29.040 --> 51:30.269
right out of the front door.

51:34.400 --> 51:35.390
Let's go.

51:37.360 --> 51:38.350
I love him.

51:40.400 --> 51:41.549
I love him, Achilles.

51:44.200 --> 51:45.190
And?

51:46.040 --> 51:47.951
You more than any will know

51:49.160 --> 51:50.798
I do not love Menelaus.

51:52.240 --> 51:53.469
Never did.

51:54.320 --> 51:55.719
That's not my concern.

51:55.760 --> 51:56.830
It should be.

51:58.720 --> 52:01.075
You're taking a woman you admire

52:01.120 --> 52:04.351
by force, back to a man she abhors.

52:06.720 --> 52:08.438
I'm following orders.

52:12.880 --> 52:14.314
SOLDIERS:
My lord.

52:14.760 --> 52:15.989
The Achilles I knew

52:17.000 --> 52:17.990
obeyed no one.

52:19.760 --> 52:21.353
He answered only to himself.

52:22.680 --> 52:23.750
The Achilles I knew

52:24.920 --> 52:26.274
was a match for me.

52:28.240 --> 52:29.196
This is war.

52:31.400 --> 52:34.438
Not some stupid game.
<i>—</i> This isn't war.

52:35.600 --> 52:39.275
This is you breaking into
a defenseless woman's bedroom

52:39.520 --> 52:41.431
to appease a man I know...

52:42.480 --> 52:43.993
you don't respect.

52:52.400 --> 52:53.913
It's beneath you...

52:55.600 --> 52:56.920
my warrior...

53:01.160 --> 53:02.480
and you know it.

53:04.160 --> 53:05.309
Come with me now.

53:07.280 --> 53:09.317
And this war ends immediately.

53:11.040 --> 53:13.316
The army packs up, the men go home.

53:14.080 --> 53:15.718
There's no more pointless suffering.

53:17.520 --> 53:18.351
I can't.

53:20.720 --> 53:21.551
Do what you will

53:22.960 --> 53:24.189
but I won't go willingly.

53:27.840 --> 53:29.399

Is it true? Are they returning?

53:29.480 --> 53:30.356
Yes, ma'am. Come.

53:32.400 --> 53:36.109
You. Fetch Princess Helen. Now.
<i>—</i> Sir.

53:37.400 --> 53:40.074
If you stay here,
there will be bloodshed...

53:41.560 --> 53:42.470
and destruction.

53:43.440 --> 53:45.750
Neither you nor I will be exempt.

53:46.840 --> 53:47.910
Trust me.

53:47.960 --> 53:49.871
War scars all.

53:51.120 --> 53:52.349
But as a warrior...

53:54.480 --> 53:56.073
you must also understand...

53:57.480 --> 53:59.357
it is better to die with honour...

54:01.000 --> 54:02.638
than to surrender in shame.

54:37.040 --> 54:37.871
PARIS: Whoa.

54:38.840 --> 54:41.229
Hector. Alexander.

54:42.280 --> 54:43.634
With the compliments of King Eetion.

54:44.520 --> 54:45.430
The first of many.

54:46.440 --> 54:47.271
He agreed?

54:48.040 --> 54:49.951
They've already started digging
from the sea.

54:54.720 --> 54:56.791

that you wouldn't make it back.

56:04.840 --> 56:06.160
I'm sorry.

56:08.040 --> 56:08.871
My love.

56:10.360 --> 56:12.317
Listen... Listen, we did it.

56:13.240 --> 56:15.629
In two months Cilicia will be able to send
food and supplies

56:15.720 --> 56:17.074
enough to feed the whole city.

56:18.080 --> 56:19.070
We're gonna be alright.

56:19.560 --> 56:20.391

56:36.640 --> 56:37.869
HELEN: Hold me tight.

56:42.880 --> 56:44.553
What will you tell Odysseus?

56:45.400 --> 56:47.471
I'll tell him we could have delivered him
a corpse.

56:48.160 --> 56:50.356
Is that what Menelaus would like
to screw at night?

56:51.880 --> 56:52.711
Besides

56:53.800 --> 56:55.916
I have something Odysseus
will love even more.

56:57.320 --> 56:58.151
Information.

57:01.880 --> 57:02.711
ACHILLES:
Cilicia.

57:04.080 --> 57:05.559
Does that name mean anything to you?
