09:42.250 --> 09:43.875
- WOULD YOU LIKE A FEW CANS?

09:43.875 --> 09:45.375
- ABSOLUTELY.

09:45.375 --> 09:46.917
IT'S FREE.

09:46.917 --> 09:49.375
- MATT, DO YOU MIND
IF WE GET A SHOT OF YOU

09:49.375 --> 09:53.250
MAYBE HOLDING THE VIVE-8?

09:53.250 --> 09:54.667
- NOTHING'S FREE.

09:54.667 --> 09:56.166
[keys clacking]

09:56.166 --> 10:00.458
I'M JUST SAYING, TRY TO BE
A LITTLE SELECTIVE.

10:00.458 --> 10:02.375
HEY, EYES HERE.

10:02.375 --> 10:04.125
'CAUSE WHATEVER YOU TAKE,
I GOT TO DO A PICTURE,

10:04.125 --> 10:05.500
AND THEN IT SHOWS UP
ON THEIR WEBSITE,

10:05.500 --> 10:07.834
AND SUDDENLY,
I'M ENDORSING THEIR SHIT.

10:07.834 --> 10:11.083
SO ALL I'M ASKING IS THAT
YOU DON'T TAKE EVERYTHING.

10:11.083 --> 10:14.250
- OOH, PEANUT BRITTLE.

10:14.250 --> 10:16.583
- SO TELL ME, HOW ARE YOU?
WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN UP TO?

10:16.583 --> 10:18.750
- OH, I'M OUT HERE
TRYING TO GET MEETINGS

10:18.750 --> 10:20.625
AND, OF COURSE,
NOT GETTING MEETINGS.

10:20.625 --> 10:22.250
EH, I'VE GOT THIS SCRIPT.

10:22.250 --> 10:24.500
I CAN'T EVEN GET ANYONE
TO READ IT TO REJECT IT.

10:24.500 --> 10:27.125
- I KNOW.
IT'S A HORRIBLE, STUPID TOWN.

10:27.125 --> 10:29.041
- SAID THE MAN
WITH TWO  TV SHOWS.

10:29.041 --> 10:30.625
- RIGHT, OKAY, FIRST OF ALL,

10:30.625 --> 10:32.834
PUCKS!  HAS BEEN
A BLOODY NIGHTMARE.

10:32.834 --> 10:34.375
- AW.
- NO, NO, SERIOUSLY--

10:34.375 --> 10:36.875
FROM START TO FINISH,
A FUCKING DISASTER.

10:36.875 --> 10:37.959
- OH, POPPET.

10:37.959 --> 10:39.291
DO I LOOK LIKE I FEEL SORRY
FOR YOU?

10:39.291 --> 10:40.792
'CAUSE I'M TRYING SO VERY HARD.

10:40.792 --> 10:41.709
- PRICK.

10:41.709 --> 10:43.166
- WHAT? YOU WANT SYMPATHY?

10:43.166 --> 10:45.291
YOUR PICTURE'S ON THE FRONT
OF VARIETY,

10:45.291 --> 10:47.208
WHICH WAS VERY EXCITING,
BY THE WAY.

10:47.208 --> 10:49.333
- WELL...
- WHEN I READ THE THING,

10:49.333 --> 10:52.291
I WAS LIKE, "OH, MY GOD.

10:52.291 --> 10:54.208
THEY'RE MAKING OUR SHOW."

10:54.208 --> 10:56.166
- I'M SORRY. WHAT?
- OUR SHOW.

10:56.166 --> 10:58.208
YOU--YOU FINALLY GOT IT ON.

10:58.208 --> 10:59.959
- OH! NO. NO.

10:59.959 --> 11:01.750
ACTUALLY, THE SHOW
BEV AND I ARE DOING

11:01.750 --> 11:03.166
IS VASTLY DIFFERENT
FROM THAT THING

11:03.166 --> 11:04.333
YOU AND I KICKED AROUND.

11:04.333 --> 11:05.500
- WELL, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

11:05.500 --> 11:07.750
- NO, NO.
IT ABSOLUTELY IS.

11:07.750 --> 11:10.291
THE OPPOSITE OF US
BEARS NO RESEMBLANCE TO--

11:10.291 --> 11:12.333
I CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER
THE NAME OF THE THING--

11:12.333 --> 11:14.125
- WE'RE NOT THEM.

11:14.125 --> 11:15.750
- RIGHT.

11:15.750 --> 11:18.083
- I MEAN, THEY'RE BOTH
ABOUT TWO FAMILIES.

11:18.083 --> 11:19.667
- WELL...

11:19.667 --> 11:21.291
- THEY'VE BOTH GOT THE SAME CAST
PLAYING TWO PARTS.

11:21.291 --> 11:24.291
- RIGHT,
BUT THE SPECIFIC CHARACTERS,

11:24.291 --> 11:26.041
THE STORY, THE SCENES--

11:26.041 --> 11:27.834
BELIEVE ME, IF YOU'D READ IT,
YOU'D REALIZE--

11:27.834 --> 11:29.792
- OH, I'VE READ IT.
- YOU'VE READ IT?

11:29.792 --> 11:31.458
- I GOT A COPY
FROM STANLEY RICHARDSON.

11:31.458 --> 11:33.250
HE'S STILL MY AGENT TOO,
YOU KNOW.

11:33.250 --> 11:35.083
GOD, HE'S USELESS.

11:35.083 --> 11:37.166
- BUT HE GAVE YOU OUR SCRIPT?

11:37.166 --> 11:40.333
- RIGHT,
SO NOT COMPLETELY USELESS.

11:53.375 --> 11:55.417
- AND I CAN JUST TAKE THIS?

11:55.417 --> 11:57.875
- OR WE CAN SHIP IT TO YOU.

11:57.875 --> 11:59.709

SUDDENLY, ALL THE CRAP
YOU'VE PUT US THROUGH

12:02.291 --> 12:04.875
IS TOTALLY WORTH IT.

ABOUT DOING OUR PROJECT?

12:34.917 --> 12:37.041
THAT'S GOT TO BE
A BIT AWKWARD FOR HER.

12:37.041 --> 12:39.667
- SHE DOESN'T FEEL ANYTHING,
BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T DISCUSSED IT,

12:39.667 --> 12:44.667
BECAUSE, NO OFFENSE,
IT'S NOT THE SAME SHOW.

12:44.667 --> 12:46.667
- AND YET IT IS.

12:46.667 --> 12:47.875
I'M STEALING ONE OF YOUR CHIPS.

IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM YOURS.

FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

16:49.083 --> 16:52.000
TO DO SHIT TO THE PEOPLE
IN THE OTHER BOXES.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.625
THEY CAN MAKE SOMEONE ELSE'S BOX
COLDER OR HOTTER

AND THE AUDIENCE YELLS,
"RELEASE THE BUGS!"

17:30.375 --> 17:31.542
- NO.

I WANT YOU TO SEE SOMETHING.

17:52.583 --> 17:55.709
YOUR SON DREW THIS

18:05.250 --> 18:06.834
IT'S NOT LIKE
THERE'S A DICK IN IT.

18:06.834 --> 18:08.041
- THEY CALLED ME FROM SCHOOL.

18:08.041 --> 18:09.333

18:09.333 --> 18:11.583
THIS IS VERY IMPRESSIVE.

18:11.583 --> 18:13.667
- HOW DO YOU NOT GET--
- I GET IT.

18:13.667 --> 18:14.834
BUT, JESUS, LOOK AT THIS.

18:14.834 --> 18:16.291
THE WAY HE DREW THE LEGS--

18:16.291 --> 18:19.500
IT'S GOT PERSPECTIVE.
IT'S GOT DETAIL.

18:19.500 --> 18:20.917

- YEAH.

18:20.917 --> 18:22.583
- HE'S EIGHT.

18:22.583 --> 18:25.583
WHEN I WAS EIGHT, I COULDN'T
DRAW A HOUSE WITH CLOUDS.

18:25.583 --> 18:27.625
HE'S TALENTED.

18:27.625 --> 18:28.834
- ARE YOU FUCKING WITH ME?

18:28.834 --> 18:29.917

18:29.917 --> 18:31.959
TRY TO GET PAST
THE PUSSY PART.

18:31.959 --> 18:33.291
- THERE'S NOTHING PAST
THE PUSSY PART.

18:33.291 --> 18:35.875
- YEAH, THERE IS.
LOOK AT THE EXECUTION.

18:35.875 --> 18:39.083

18:47.166 --> 18:48.709
- STILL, YOU'RE HIS FATHER.

18:48.709 --> 18:50.125
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO TEACH HIM
SHIT LIKE THIS.

18:50.125 --> 18:51.667
- HEY, I CANNOT TAKE CREDIT
FOR THIS.

18:51.667 --> 18:53.458
THAT THING I DREW
WAS LIKE A STICK FIGURE.

18:53.458 --> 18:55.291
THIS...

18:55.291 --> 18:56.500
IS A GIFT.

19:00.959 --> 19:02.375
- YOU'RE NOT PUTTING IT
ON YOUR FRIDGE.

19:02.375 --> 19:04.125
- I AM SO PUTTING IT
ON MY FRIDGE.

19:04.125 --> 19:06.083

19:08.250 --> 19:10.875
NOBODY PITCHES LIKE YOU DO.

19:10.875 --> 19:13.458

YOUR "A" GAME.

19:13.458 --> 19:15.000
- AH, THIS THING
PITCHES ITSELF.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.709
I'M TELLING YOU,

20:22.291 --> 20:23.792
[perfume spraying]

20:23.792 --> 20:24.959
- OH, THESE ARE KIND OF COOL.

20:24.959 --> 20:26.875

20:52.917 --> 20:55.125

MISSING THE POINT.

21:22.166 --> 21:24.291
