00:01.001 --> 00:03.670
Previously on Secrets of Sulphur Springs…

00:03.753 --> 00:05.130
Once this hotel is done, Bennett,

00:05.213 --> 00:07.775
everyone in town will forget all about
that ridiculous ghost business.

00:07.799 --> 00:11.386
- From now on, just stay out of my hair.
- Why won't you work?

00:12.846 --> 00:14.472
Hold on, Harper. I'm on my way.

00:14.556 --> 00:16.617
According to your agreement
with Judge Emmett Walker,

00:16.641 --> 00:19.352
you are ordered to vacate
this property within 48 hours.

00:19.436 --> 00:20.729
Wyatt and Zoey have the crystal.

00:20.812 --> 00:22.081
Don't think about looking for it.

00:22.105 --> 00:23.940
I think I'm sitting
on Wyatt's hiding place.

00:24.024 --> 00:25.900
Is that a crack?
This jagged line right here.

00:25.984 --> 00:26.985
That wasn't there before?

00:27.068 --> 00:28.695
No, it wasn't.

00:37.412 --> 00:39.497
You said Judge Walker
was a man of his word,

00:39.581 --> 00:42.959
that signing those papers
would allow us to stay here.

00:43.043 --> 00:44.669
I know what I said, Sam.

00:44.753 --> 00:46.338
This isn't what you signed, though.

00:46.421 --> 00:49.101
The agreement was for the land
and the springs, never the farmhouse.

00:49.174 --> 00:52.802
Judge must've changed his mind
along with the paperwork.

00:52.886 --> 00:55.430
He can't do that! We have to tell someone.

00:55.513 --> 00:59.142
Think anyone in this town would take
my word over Judge Walker's?

00:59.225 --> 01:00.852
Sheriff sure didn't want to listen.

01:02.437 --> 01:04.481
Better start getting things in order.

01:04.564 --> 01:05.857
Two days ain't much time.

01:05.940 --> 01:08.360
Papa! We can't just leave.

01:08.443 --> 01:09.778
This is our home.

01:09.861 --> 01:11.863
Mother would want us to stay and fight.

01:11.946 --> 01:14.032
Your mother would understand why we can't.

01:14.115 --> 01:16.201
She'd want me to keep you kids safe.

01:16.284 --> 01:17.410
That's what I'm doin'.

01:17.952 --> 01:19.245
Come now.

01:30.715 --> 01:33.301
Your family can't let
that slimy judge win.

01:33.885 --> 01:35.804
Sam's right. They have to do something.

01:35.887 --> 01:37.073
But if Elijah puts up a fight,

01:37.097 --> 01:39.391
the judge will find another way to get
what he wants.

01:39.474 --> 01:41.351
Something that could
hurt my family even worse.

01:41.434 --> 01:42.560
Like in my visions.

01:42.644 --> 01:44.771
So you're, like, psychic now?

01:44.854 --> 01:47.899
Not exactly. I didn't see this coming.

01:47.982 --> 01:51.569
Well, at least now we know
how your family lost The Tremont.

01:51.653 --> 01:54.447
That's it! That's why Grace wanted me
to come back here.

01:54.531 --> 01:56.658
To see what happened
so I can make things right.

01:56.741 --> 01:57.784
Hang on, Sam.

01:57.867 --> 01:59.828
If you won't do anything, I will!

02:01.705 --> 02:04.249
We have to stop him.
Then I've got to get home.

02:05.625 --> 02:07.085
You'll need this. Those too.

02:25.812 --> 02:27.689
Sam! There you are.

02:28.398 --> 02:31.192
Room 205 is complaining
about that draft again.

02:31.276 --> 02:33.361
Would you have some time now
to take a look?

02:34.195 --> 02:35.363
I've got nothing but time.

02:53.423 --> 02:54.549
Mother?

02:57.218 --> 02:58.720
Daisy, come on.

03:02.891 --> 03:04.893
I can't believe we managed
to pull this off.

03:05.977 --> 03:07.937
I... I mean, sure, you look like Harper,

03:08.021 --> 03:10.482
but I didn't think anyone would
actually believe you were her.

03:10.565 --> 03:11.876
Not that you didn't do a good job.

03:11.900 --> 03:13.735
- It's just that Harper is...
- Special?

03:14.694 --> 03:17.572
Um, different.

03:18.323 --> 03:20.575
So, uh, you ready to go home?

03:21.534 --> 03:24.162
I've missed Papa and Sam so much but…

03:25.830 --> 03:27.874
- I'm not sure I can leave.
- What?

03:27.957 --> 03:29.250
No, you have to switch back.

03:29.334 --> 03:31.628
Harper can't stay in 1930.
Her life is here.

03:31.711 --> 03:32.879
So is my mother.

03:32.962 --> 03:36.007
How can I possibly go back home,
knowing her spirit hasn't found peace?

03:36.091 --> 03:37.926
Staying is not an option.

03:38.009 --> 03:40.387
You have to grow up in the past,
get married, have a family,

03:40.470 --> 03:42.055
or else Harper won't exist, remember?

03:42.138 --> 03:43.515
But my mother.

03:43.598 --> 03:45.975
I know how awful it feels
being trapped somewhere.

03:46.893 --> 03:49.521
Listen, this could be
your last chance to go home.

03:49.604 --> 03:52.982
Topher already knows about the bunker.
How long until someone else finds it?

03:53.066 --> 03:55.276
Please, Daisy.
I get wanting to help Grace and all,

03:55.360 --> 03:58.279
but what about the rest of your family?

03:58.363 --> 04:00.782
Your dad, Sam, Harper, they all need you.

04:06.955 --> 04:09.416
Forgive me, Mother.
I have to do this.

04:54.669 --> 04:56.880
Wyatt! Zoey!

04:56.963 --> 05:01.217
I told you no more videos
until after you finish your homework.

05:03.178 --> 05:05.597
Something's here in this house.

05:05.680 --> 05:06.931
I swear if it's you, man…

05:07.015 --> 05:10.060
Oh, hey! Hey, no! I'll go!

05:18.026 --> 05:20.820
I'll go right now! Don't do it!

05:22.822 --> 05:25.075
This is new.

05:25.158 --> 05:26.743
The ghost doesn't seem too happy.

05:26.826 --> 05:30.497
Could have something to do with that rock
you were telling me about.

05:30.580 --> 05:31.790
Where's your dad?

05:31.873 --> 05:34.709
- Outside, I think.
- Come on. Now!

05:37.671 --> 05:38.672
Ben?

05:38.755 --> 05:40.048
Ben!

05:40.757 --> 05:41.758
What's wrong?

05:41.841 --> 05:43.927
Everything is going crazy inside!

05:44.010 --> 05:45.011
The lights. The radio.

05:45.095 --> 05:46.513
It's happening upstairs too.

05:46.596 --> 05:49.849
Well, I'm... I'm having the workers
do an overhaul of the electrical system.

05:49.933 --> 05:51.413
It's probably just a circuit breaker.

05:52.060 --> 05:53.812
Where's your, uh, where's your fuse box?

05:53.895 --> 05:55.355
Down in the basement. I'll show you.

05:59.734 --> 06:00.985
It's not the workers.

06:01.069 --> 06:04.364
It's the ghost sending a message
loud and clear.

06:04.447 --> 06:06.533
Put the rock back now or else…

06:07.158 --> 06:10.245
- Or else...
- Do not finish that sentence.

06:20.964 --> 06:22.424
You're doing the right thing, Daisy.

06:23.216 --> 06:24.217
I hope so.

06:25.051 --> 06:27.011
The thought of my mother's spirit
still in pain...

06:27.053 --> 06:29.681
We'll figure something out
as soon as we get Harper back.

06:29.764 --> 06:30.849
I promise.

06:33.601 --> 06:35.770
So does it usually take this long?

06:35.854 --> 06:37.397
J-Just give it a minute.

06:38.064 --> 06:40.233
The crystal probably needs to warm up.

06:41.026 --> 06:44.029
Griffin, we saw a crack. What if...

06:54.414 --> 06:56.791
Money can buy you a lot of things,

06:56.875 --> 07:00.211
but a qualified electrician
is clearly not one of them.

07:00.295 --> 07:02.547
Well, don't get rid of the guy just yet.

07:02.630 --> 07:04.507
May take some time to find another.

07:05.050 --> 07:06.885
Can't afford too many more setbacks.

07:06.968 --> 07:09.721
Nothing is going to get in the way
of this hotel reopening.

07:09.804 --> 07:12.515
And when it does,
I will be your first guest.

07:14.601 --> 07:16.061
If that's all right with you.

07:16.853 --> 07:17.854
Of course it is.

07:18.813 --> 07:20.482
You'll always have a room here, Dad.

07:20.565 --> 07:21.900
No reservation required.

07:27.989 --> 07:30.709
Uh, shine that light a little...
A little higher, would you, Bennett?

07:31.659 --> 07:33.203
Dad!

07:42.045 --> 07:43.963
It isn't working.

07:44.047 --> 07:45.256
It has to!

07:46.675 --> 07:48.968
- Come on!
- Griffin, stop.

07:49.052 --> 07:50.970
No! I'm not giving up on Harper.

07:51.054 --> 07:53.640
Open, please.

07:55.141 --> 07:56.768
We'll find another way.

08:04.442 --> 08:06.111
You don't understand, Daisy.

08:06.194 --> 08:07.654
The portal is the only way back,

08:07.737 --> 08:10.448
and it doesn't work with... without…

08:13.368 --> 08:14.494
Where are you going?

08:14.577 --> 08:16.162
We have to get the power back on.

08:18.873 --> 08:21.376
Listen to us. It has to be ghosts.

08:22.502 --> 08:24.045
- What happened?
- Call an ambulance.

08:24.129 --> 08:26.715
Do not call an ambulance.
It was just a little shock.

08:26.798 --> 08:28.633
You lost consciousness, Dad.

08:28.717 --> 08:29.759
Mom?

08:29.843 --> 08:32.595
Hi, I need paramedics to 860 Bayou Road.

08:32.679 --> 08:33.888
I told you, I'm fine.

08:33.972 --> 08:36.266
- Mom!
- She's on the phone, Wyatt.

08:36.349 --> 08:37.517
Yes. Yes, The Tremont.

08:37.600 --> 08:39.602
- My father-in-law had an accident.
- Fire!

08:41.438 --> 08:43.231
I never should've touched that rock.

08:43.314 --> 08:45.316
And now there's smoke
coming out of the basement.

08:45.400 --> 08:47.902
- Tell them to hurry!
- Calm down. There's no need to panic.

08:47.986 --> 08:49.904
Yes, there is. My hat's inside!

08:49.988 --> 08:52.615
The hat can be replaced.
Stay with your sister and brother.

08:54.409 --> 08:56.369
Wait. Where's Griffin?

09:00.623 --> 09:03.460
Listen. I'll find a fire extinguisher.
You call 911.

09:03.543 --> 09:05.962
- 911?
- Just press the numbers.

09:06.046 --> 09:08.048
When someone answers,
tell 'em it's an emergency.

09:08.131 --> 09:10.592
No, you can't go back in there, Griffin.
It isn't safe!

09:10.675 --> 09:12.677
If the basement burns,
we can't get to the bunker.

09:12.761 --> 09:14.054
You'll be trapped here.

09:14.137 --> 09:16.222
And you'll never see Harper again.

09:16.306 --> 09:18.350
What are you doing in here?

09:18.433 --> 09:19.476
We smelled smoke.

09:19.559 --> 09:21.287
Yeah, the fire department's
already on the way.

09:21.311 --> 09:23.229
Come on, everyone's waiting outside.
Let's go.

09:54.469 --> 09:56.054
Take it easy tonight.

09:56.137 --> 09:58.056
Any headaches, nausea, dizziness,

09:58.139 --> 10:00.225
I want you to go to the closest ER,
understood?

10:00.308 --> 10:02.477
- I'm fine, really.
- Understood?

10:02.560 --> 10:03.895
Understood.

10:10.110 --> 10:11.695
Dad, I don't know what to say.

10:17.075 --> 10:19.035
All clear. Smoke's pretty much gone too.

10:19.119 --> 10:20.245
Check for toxicity?

10:20.328 --> 10:21.913
Yeah. And she's clean.

10:25.792 --> 10:27.460
So it's safe to go back inside?

10:27.544 --> 10:30.088
Yes, ma'am. I'd open up some windows,

10:30.171 --> 10:32.331
though you've already got
a pretty good draft in there.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.426
Especially on the second floor.

10:37.012 --> 10:38.471
Is there something else?

10:38.555 --> 10:40.390
Anyone living in room 205?

10:41.182 --> 10:42.267
No one.

10:42.350 --> 10:45.145
We use it mostly for storage. Why?

10:45.228 --> 10:47.731
When I was checking it out,
I noticed it seemed very cold.

10:47.814 --> 10:52.444
And I saw what I thought was smoke,
but it was just this mist,

10:52.527 --> 10:54.404
like you see in the mornings
in the pastures.

10:54.487 --> 10:56.527
Anyway, nothing was burning,
so I locked it back up.

10:57.365 --> 10:58.366
Thank you.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.916
You know what we're gonna hear,
don't you?

11:07.000 --> 11:08.918
"No logical explanation."

11:09.002 --> 11:11.463
When we all know exactly
what the explanation is.

11:11.546 --> 11:13.882
- But will they listen to us?
- Nope.

11:13.965 --> 11:16.593
Because you guys have been screaming
the same thing for days.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.345
You've heard of Chicken Little, right?

11:18.428 --> 11:20.305
Yeah, yeah. "The sky is falling."

11:20.388 --> 11:21.973
But in this case, it really is!

11:22.682 --> 11:24.434
There's a ghost in that hotel.

11:25.226 --> 11:28.104
I don't know, maybe there are two ghosts.
Or maybe 100.

11:28.188 --> 11:29.564
Topher! Harper!

11:30.398 --> 11:32.442
Thank God you're all right.

11:32.525 --> 11:33.943
Come on. Let's go home.

11:34.027 --> 11:35.195
Bye, guys.

11:36.571 --> 11:37.697
It's getting worse.

11:38.448 --> 11:40.088
There's no telling how this is gonna end.

11:40.116 --> 11:42.285
Especially when we don't even know
where it began.

11:50.043 --> 11:52.629
There he is. He paces when he's thinking.

11:52.712 --> 11:54.214
His grown-up self does that too.

11:56.716 --> 11:57.884
What are you doing?

11:57.967 --> 11:59.886
Or maybe I should ask,
what are you planning?

11:59.969 --> 12:01.513
What does it look like?

12:01.596 --> 12:03.223
I've got business with the judge.

12:03.306 --> 12:06.017
- There's things he needs to hear.
- Like what, exactly?

12:06.101 --> 12:09.062
First, I'm gonna call him
a no-good, lying grifter,

12:09.145 --> 12:11.231
then I'm gonna get him
to admit what he did.

12:11.314 --> 12:12.899
He's a judge, Sam. You can't do that.

12:12.982 --> 12:14.484
Oh, yeah?

12:15.902 --> 12:16.986
Watch me!

12:17.070 --> 12:18.780
Out of my way, Daisy.

12:18.863 --> 12:19.863
Sam!

12:25.328 --> 12:28.873
You promised! You gave us your word
that we could stay on the land!

12:28.957 --> 12:30.875
Now, now. Easy there, young man.

12:30.959 --> 12:34.170
Come on, Sam.
I'm sure the judge is very busy.

12:34.254 --> 12:36.339
- Papa's waiting for us at home.
- She's right, son.

12:36.423 --> 12:39.551
You listen to your sister and your daddy.

12:39.634 --> 12:41.720
And remember, he did this for you.

12:43.847 --> 12:48.101
Let go! I needed to make our case
since you and Papa won't!

12:48.184 --> 12:51.438
Sure, Papa, I get,
all filled with sadness over Mother.

12:51.521 --> 12:55.066
But if you were really Daisy,
you'd be fighting this too,

12:55.150 --> 12:56.234
right alongside me.

12:56.317 --> 12:58.403
It's a losing battle, Topher.
Can't you see…

12:59.487 --> 13:00.822
Who's Topher?

13:00.905 --> 13:03.241
I don't know. I just... Look, Sam...

13:03.324 --> 13:06.077
You just stay away from me!

13:11.791 --> 13:13.585
Finch case is on the docket for tomorrow.

13:13.668 --> 13:15.670
Make sure you have
the brief ready and organized.

13:15.754 --> 13:17.422
Already in the works.

13:18.506 --> 13:20.467
That kid sure caused a ruckus back there.

13:20.550 --> 13:22.677
Oh, nothin' to worry about.

13:22.761 --> 13:24.346
You got the document for their farm?

13:24.846 --> 13:29.476
If you mean the original
that Elijah signed, got it right here.

13:30.352 --> 13:31.519
You want me to tear it up?

13:31.603 --> 13:33.271
It can go out with tonight's trash.

13:33.355 --> 13:34.814
I'll take care of it tomorrow.

13:36.858 --> 13:38.401
It'll be safe here till then.

13:45.950 --> 13:47.118
Harper.

13:47.952 --> 13:50.121
- Where have you been?
- It doesn't matter.

13:50.205 --> 13:52.040
I know where the real document is,

13:52.123 --> 13:53.963
and I know how we're gonna get
our hands on it.

14:00.048 --> 14:02.717
Dad. Dad, slow down.

14:02.801 --> 14:04.552
You don't have to leave tonight.

14:04.636 --> 14:06.888
Uh, didn't they tell you to rest?

14:06.971 --> 14:10.767
What? How am I gonna rest in that… place?

14:10.850 --> 14:13.645
The sander, the porch, the fuse box?

14:13.728 --> 14:16.064
Haunted, cursed, or just falling apart,

14:16.147 --> 14:18.483
The Tremont is a lawsuit
waiting to happen.

14:18.566 --> 14:20.318
Look, Dad.

14:20.402 --> 14:23.196
Come on, we've been working together
and it's...

14:23.279 --> 14:24.322
It's been good.

14:24.406 --> 14:28.076
Until today.
The contractors have all backed out.

14:28.660 --> 14:31.371
No amount of money
is going to insure this place.

14:31.454 --> 14:32.580
I wanted it to work out.

14:32.664 --> 14:34.416
I really did.

14:34.499 --> 14:36.167
But it's useless.

14:36.251 --> 14:38.712
Plain and simple, that place wants us out.

14:39.587 --> 14:41.464
I'm sorry, Bennett. Sarah.

14:55.687 --> 14:56.938
It's not fair.

15:07.615 --> 15:10.952
So? What are you?
Like some big fancy judge?

15:11.036 --> 15:13.955
I've been called a lot of things,
but never fancy.

15:14.039 --> 15:15.373
If you don't mind me asking,

15:15.457 --> 15:17.042
I read somewhere about this law

15:17.125 --> 15:19.836
that it's illegal to tie your alligator up
to a fire hydrant.

15:19.919 --> 15:20.962
You ever hear that?

15:21.046 --> 15:22.839
I can't say that I have.

15:22.922 --> 15:25.967
Yep, it's pretty amazing
what they come up with these days, huh?

15:26.051 --> 15:28.845
I'm thinking I wanna be a lawyer
when I'm older.

15:28.928 --> 15:30.722
I mean, I'm pretty good in school,

15:30.805 --> 15:34.309
and I like helping people and alligators.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.895
Oh, that's dandy, little lady.

15:36.978 --> 15:39.457
But shouldn't you be
a little more practical in your ambitions?

15:39.481 --> 15:41.274
Find yourself a lawyer to marry.

15:41.983 --> 15:43.026
Not sure I understand.

15:43.109 --> 15:45.111
Nothing wrong with being married
to a lawyer.

15:45.195 --> 15:46.529
Just ask my wifey.

16:08.677 --> 16:10.887
Grandpa must've been really spooked
to bail on you.

16:16.267 --> 16:19.354
- If I just knew the answer.
- To what?

16:22.232 --> 16:23.358
All of this.

16:25.443 --> 16:26.695
This hotel.

16:27.320 --> 16:29.239
Its secrets, the mystery.

16:30.949 --> 16:33.201
What's in the mirror?
What's in the basement?

16:34.703 --> 16:37.706
Why won't it let us finish this place

16:38.832 --> 16:40.458
or, God forbid, open it?

16:58.435 --> 16:59.561
We're good people!

17:00.854 --> 17:02.939
You hear me?

17:03.732 --> 17:07.193
All we want to do is open this place
back up again, give it another chance.

17:08.403 --> 17:10.572
What's so wrong with that? Huh?

17:11.990 --> 17:13.241
Why won't you let us?

17:14.993 --> 17:16.036
You know what?

17:18.496 --> 17:20.415
You may have driven my father away,

17:21.374 --> 17:22.459
but I'm not giving up.

17:23.793 --> 17:24.919
You hear me?

17:25.962 --> 17:27.255
We will not give up.

17:27.881 --> 17:30.550
Not today, not tomorrow, not ever!

17:30.633 --> 17:34.679
We're finishing the work and we're
opening this hotel and you just...

17:35.764 --> 17:37.098
You better get used to it!

17:44.606 --> 17:46.024
You go, Dad!

17:50.779 --> 17:52.113
Harper!

17:52.947 --> 17:54.824
I did what I could to slow him down,

17:54.908 --> 17:56.076
and then he did this whole

17:56.159 --> 17:58.411
"ladies can't be lawyers,
only wifeys" thing.

17:58.495 --> 18:00.080
So 1930s.

18:00.163 --> 18:01.706
- Did you get it?
- It's right here.

18:02.457 --> 18:05.418
I checked it. It's the one Elijah signed,
letting him keep the house.

18:05.502 --> 18:08.046
So what now? Do we give it to Elijah?

18:08.129 --> 18:10.048
Sam? The Supreme Court?

18:10.131 --> 18:12.175
Or maybe The People's Court?

18:12.258 --> 18:14.552
Oh, wait, no.
Television's not been invented yet.

18:14.636 --> 18:15.970
Savannah!

18:16.054 --> 18:18.734
We're gonna get this document
once and for all into the right hands,

18:18.807 --> 18:20.809
but not into the hands you think.

18:25.271 --> 18:28.400
I've told you a hundred times
that place is cursed!

18:28.483 --> 18:31.403
I don't understand why you won't
listen to me and why you keep going back.

18:31.986 --> 18:33.738
Don't you want us to have friends?

18:33.822 --> 18:35.824
Of course, I do, baby.

18:35.907 --> 18:38.827
I'm not saying you can't be friends
with other kids

18:38.910 --> 18:40.829
or the Campbell kids.

18:40.912 --> 18:43.623
It's just that hotel and...

18:43.707 --> 18:45.917
And the ghosts who dwell there.

18:46.001 --> 18:47.961
That's not what I was gonna say.

18:48.044 --> 18:49.421
But you were thinking it.

18:49.504 --> 18:51.506
You said our dad was drawn to it.

18:51.589 --> 18:54.551
And you were before the Campbells
showed up, right?

18:55.427 --> 18:57.804
- Right.
- And I couldn't stay away.

18:58.596 --> 19:00.223
And now you can't either.

19:00.306 --> 19:01.850
That's nonsense.

19:01.933 --> 19:04.477
The only time I go there is when
I'm chasing after you two.

19:05.729 --> 19:10.817
And yes, your dad had an obsession with it
because it was in his family.

19:10.900 --> 19:13.403
When you married him,
you became a part of his family.

19:13.486 --> 19:16.197
Just as other women who married
into our family did.

19:16.740 --> 19:18.992
It wasn't the man's land or her land.

19:19.075 --> 19:20.201
It became their land.

19:21.369 --> 19:23.496
You got a lot from going through
that old trunk.

19:24.164 --> 19:26.124
All you have to do
is look at our family tree.

19:29.252 --> 19:31.671
All right, you two need to go to bed.

19:31.755 --> 19:34.049
Okay, so we'll table this?

19:34.132 --> 19:35.550
I'm not changing my mind.

19:36.217 --> 19:38.595
You will if The Tremont wants you to.

19:40.555 --> 19:42.265
- Good night, Mom.
- Good night.

20:04.579 --> 20:05.997
You were pretty good back there.

20:06.873 --> 20:08.416
Had me snowed.

20:09.125 --> 20:11.252
I meant it. Every word.

20:16.132 --> 20:17.175
Good night, sis.

20:29.938 --> 20:31.356
I'm sorry it took so long.

20:31.439 --> 20:33.358
You're here now. Let's get going.

20:33.441 --> 20:34.693
Griffin!

20:38.488 --> 20:40.657
There you are.
I need another pair of hands.

20:41.574 --> 20:45.328
- Unless you got something else to do?
- Oh, no. Um, be right there.

20:45.412 --> 20:46.454
All right.

20:53.044 --> 20:54.713
Here, take this and go back.

20:54.796 --> 20:56.881
- You're not coming?
- There's no time.

20:56.965 --> 20:59.801
You need to switch with Harper
and make sure she gets back here.

20:59.884 --> 21:01.970
Then you'll stay in the past,
where you belong,

21:02.053 --> 21:04.264
and she'll stay in the present.

21:04.347 --> 21:06.349
And the world will be right again.

21:07.183 --> 21:09.728
Just use the other door and be careful.

21:17.986 --> 21:19.154
What?

21:20.196 --> 21:23.283
Just goodbye is all.

21:24.159 --> 21:26.119
Goodbye, Daisy. Good luck.

21:31.082 --> 21:33.126
Griffin, come on, son.
This can't wait!

21:33.209 --> 21:34.336
Coming!

21:37.422 --> 21:40.467
Sam, have you seen Savannah?

21:40.550 --> 21:42.153
I thought she might be
helping you out again.

21:42.177 --> 21:43.303
No. Not all day.

21:43.386 --> 21:45.638
I've been up at 205
working on locating that draft.

21:45.722 --> 21:46.848
Still can't pinpoint it.

21:46.931 --> 21:49.059
Only Mrs. Henderson
would complain about a draft

21:49.142 --> 21:50.769
in the heat of a Louisiana summer.

21:52.479 --> 21:55.023
If Savannah turns up,
I'll be sure to send her your way.

21:55.648 --> 21:56.900
Much appreciated.

22:08.995 --> 22:10.955
Savannah! Are you down there?

22:12.791 --> 22:13.833
Oh, no!

22:25.387 --> 22:27.847
Why can't you tell me
what the plan is, Harper?

22:27.931 --> 22:31.184
What else can we do
but show the paper to Elijah?

22:35.271 --> 22:36.940
Harper? What is it?

22:37.023 --> 22:38.942
Shh. Do you hear that?

22:40.193 --> 22:41.611
Someone's there.

22:46.658 --> 22:47.867
You're back!

22:47.951 --> 22:49.202
Hi, you must be Savannah.

22:49.285 --> 22:50.370
Nice to meet you, Daisy.

22:50.453 --> 22:52.831
- Where's Griffin?
- His father needed him for something.

22:52.914 --> 22:54.207
So he sent me back alone.

22:54.290 --> 22:56.167
He said we have to switch places
right away.

22:56.251 --> 22:58.920
I'm ready, and I assume you are too.

22:59.004 --> 23:01.089
Boy, this is crazy,
seeing you two together.

23:01.172 --> 23:03.425
I mean, the resemblance is truly uncanny.

23:03.508 --> 23:05.343
So no one in the present figured it out?

23:05.427 --> 23:07.679
There were some pretty close calls.
How about you?

23:07.762 --> 23:10.181
Plenty of the same.
Your brother Sam was nearly onto me.

23:10.265 --> 23:11.850
Same with Topher.

23:11.933 --> 23:13.268
I'm gonna miss that kid.

23:13.351 --> 23:15.645
And I'll miss Sam and your father.

23:15.729 --> 23:17.647
Thanks for letting me borrow your mother.

23:17.731 --> 23:19.482
It was nice having one again.

23:19.566 --> 23:21.943
And, for me, nice having a father back.

23:23.111 --> 23:24.922
There's something you need to know
about the farm.

23:24.946 --> 23:27.365
That eventually
it was turned into a hotel?

23:27.449 --> 23:29.117
Sooner than you probably know.

23:29.200 --> 23:30.744
Judge Walker bought it.

23:30.827 --> 23:33.413
Uh, excuse me,
but shouldn't that be stole it?

23:34.414 --> 23:36.916
The judge tricked your dad
with a switch of the documents.

23:38.460 --> 23:40.253
All you have to do is take this inside,

23:40.337 --> 23:42.714
show your father,
and the land stays yours forever.

23:42.797 --> 23:44.132
That's wonderful.

23:44.215 --> 23:45.967
Only it's not what you're going to do.

23:46.051 --> 23:47.052
It's not?

23:47.135 --> 23:50.764
- But if we can save the farm...
- We're not going to, Daisy.

23:50.847 --> 23:53.516
In fact, that's the last thing
you're going to do.

24:00.815 --> 24:03.234
Next time on Secrets of Sulphur Springs…

24:06.654 --> 24:09.199
Sam took a fall
down the basement stairs.

24:09.282 --> 24:11.034
- He's unconscious.
- No.

24:11.826 --> 24:13.620
Is he... Is he gone?

24:14.287 --> 24:17.707
Daisy, what are you still doing here?
You were supposed to switch with Harper.

24:17.791 --> 24:20.377
I think our ghost is on notice,
thanks to your dad.

24:20.460 --> 24:21.670
Or he made her mad.

24:21.753 --> 24:23.713
It feels calm around here.

24:23.797 --> 24:24.798
Do you trust it?

24:24.881 --> 24:26.424
Not for a second.

24:26.508 --> 24:27.759
Don't turn around, Zoey.
