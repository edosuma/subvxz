00:31.698 --> 00:32.998
What's up?

00:34.798 --> 00:36.098
Great view.

00:38.498 --> 00:40.297
Harbor, I mean.

00:43.597 --> 00:46.298
It's fucking picturesque, is what it is.

00:46.498 --> 00:49.498
Every morning I ask myself,
"Is today the day I drive down...

00:49.598 --> 00:51.697
"to Fort Armistead, stare out at the harbor?"

00:51.797 --> 00:54.497
No, I figure eventually,
if I mind my own business...

00:54.597 --> 00:57.497
Uncle Frank will wake my ass up
at 7:00 in the morning...

00:57.597 --> 01:01.497
tell me to get my ass down there
for some mysterious fucking reason.

01:08.697 --> 01:10.296
Good anchorage, good cranes...

01:10.396 --> 01:14.296
good railroads, close to l-95.
Lot of people ready to work, right?

01:14.496 --> 01:16.397
That's my fucking town.

01:18.296 --> 01:20.396
Except, the thing is,
we're another 1 10 miles...

01:20.496 --> 01:23.396
for any ship coming up
from Hampton Roads. An extra day.

01:23.496 --> 01:24.896
So why come?

01:24.996 --> 01:26.896
Unless you know your cargo's
gonna move...

01:26.995 --> 01:28.996
fast and clean through the port.

01:29.096 --> 01:31.896
Why offload in Baltimore,
except that a Baltimore gang...

01:31.996 --> 01:34.795
can turn your ship around
faster than any other port...

01:34.895 --> 01:36.696
and will make sure your cargo...

01:36.796 --> 01:40.395
all your cargo, gets where it needs to go
faster than anywhere else.

01:40.495 --> 01:42.895
Like you guys never stole nothing
back in the day.

01:42.995 --> 01:45.295
We ain't back in the day, Nicky.

01:46.495 --> 01:49.495
When was the last time
you saw trucks backed up for three miles...

01:49.695 --> 01:50.795
outside Patapsco terminal?

01:50.895 --> 01:53.794
If it wasn't for the car-ships,
we would be starving.

01:54.594 --> 01:56.395
The cameras come back.

01:56.795 --> 01:57.794
I'm serious.

01:57.894 --> 02:01.594
They come back today, we tell the shipper
we lost the can in the stacks.

02:01.694 --> 02:04.494
They're gone. We turned them over already.

02:08.193 --> 02:09.193
To who?

02:11.994 --> 02:16.094
You know the Tasco line's a cunt hair away
from taking their business down to Norfolk.

02:16.194 --> 02:19.694
-I don't need this shit right now.
-I do, Uncle Frank, I need the money.

02:19.794 --> 02:22.694
-You ain't hearing me!
-What? You think this shit is easy?

02:22.894 --> 02:26.294
You think it's fucking easy?
You try living on five or six days a month.

02:26.394 --> 02:29.994
See how fast it puts you on your ass.
I am on my ass, Uncle Frank.

02:30.094 --> 02:31.793
You need money, you come to me.

02:31.893 --> 02:34.093
Frankie Sobotka is
Father fucking Christmas...

02:34.193 --> 02:35.593
on the docks lately.

02:35.693 --> 02:38.793
-No doubt, his pockets are full.
-You think it's for me?

02:39.593 --> 02:41.493
Is that what you think?

02:41.593 --> 02:43.593
It ain't about me, Nick!

02:45.993 --> 02:47.992
I know, I'm sorry.

02:48.192 --> 02:52.793
You got Ziggy mixed up in this.
Jesus, Nick, what the fuck are you thinking?

02:54.992 --> 02:58.092
Me and Zig are gonna talk on this
long and hard.

03:11.892 --> 03:13.892
Come on, let's go to work.

03:15.191 --> 03:16.492
How much?

03:17.492 --> 03:18.591
Twenty.

03:18.691 --> 03:21.991
-Three-way split.
-Who's the inside man?

03:23.692 --> 03:25.191
You don't know?

03:26.191 --> 03:28.591
Fuck you then, I ain't no snitch.

03:30.990 --> 03:34.390
Nobody should flash too much money.
You know that much, right?

03:36.191 --> 03:37.191
Yeah.

05:14.187 --> 05:16.687
Toxicology's coming back positive
for strychnine.

05:16.787 --> 05:19.287
10%, 12%. It's pretty well laced.

05:19.387 --> 05:20.887
This was intentional?

05:20.987 --> 05:24.387
That's the ME's call, but I've seen
street packages cut all the time...

05:24.487 --> 05:25.686
with all kinds of chemicals.

05:25.786 --> 05:28.686
You don't use too much,
you give a weak package some kick.

05:28.786 --> 05:31.686
People start thinking you're high-grade,
when what you got is...

05:31.786 --> 05:34.487
stepped-on trash
with a little bit of rat poison mixed in.

05:34.587 --> 05:37.286
Too much rat poison,
you got people falling out, like we got.

05:37.486 --> 05:39.786
Be nice to have a few answers
for those reporters.

05:39.886 --> 05:40.986
What do they wanna know?

05:41.186 --> 05:43.386
How it got in, what we're doing, the usual.

05:43.486 --> 05:45.085
It got in like everything gets in.

05:45.185 --> 05:47.886
If you can't win
the war on drugs in a prison...

05:48.186 --> 05:50.186
where the hell you gonna win it? I ask you.

05:50.286 --> 05:52.785
Listen, if it were one or two dead,
it would fade.

05:52.885 --> 05:55.685
But five in one night,
and eight more in the infirmary?

05:55.785 --> 05:57.285
We need to show the flag on this.

05:57.385 --> 05:59.785
What I'm gonna need is for you all
to wheel and deal.

05:59.885 --> 06:01.185
What do you mean?

06:01.285 --> 06:03.485
If this case gets made from an informant...

06:03.585 --> 06:06.085
and you're gonna have
a couple dozen of them...

06:06.185 --> 06:08.484
if you're ready to shave some years.

06:15.584 --> 06:16.784
Colonel.

06:24.184 --> 06:25.684
-Jimmy.
-Winona.

06:29.984 --> 06:31.884
Gilligan, little buddy.

06:33.884 --> 06:35.683
Don't you have a job?

06:35.983 --> 06:36.984
Ouch!

06:44.784 --> 06:46.783
I smell fresh police work.

06:47.583 --> 06:49.483
Okay, be like that.

06:50.583 --> 06:52.683
You got some paper from inside the can?

06:52.783 --> 06:55.083
A letter, couple of envelopes,
some scraps of stuff?

06:55.183 --> 06:57.383
Yeah, everything's down
in your evidence control.

06:57.483 --> 07:00.183
-You got the submission slips?
-He does.

07:06.682 --> 07:09.482
-Lester.
-You want to pull all of it?

07:09.682 --> 07:10.983
Hold it.

07:11.583 --> 07:14.182
Before you start dancing
with your Jane Doe...

07:14.282 --> 07:17.082
I'm gonna need a little something from you
on the Gant case.

07:17.182 --> 07:20.282
I got a full set of llene Nathan's teeth marks
on my hind parts.

07:20.482 --> 07:22.782
-No problem, I got you covered.
-You found Omar?

07:22.882 --> 07:24.982
I never lost him, my friend.

07:28.682 --> 07:32.082
-He's got Omar?
-Bullshit.

07:32.182 --> 07:33.481
Who's Omar?

07:46.081 --> 07:47.681
My papers are in.

07:49.180 --> 07:50.781
They are.

07:50.981 --> 07:53.280
You want out, you're out.

07:55.081 --> 07:57.681
But I'm offering to clean the slate here.

07:58.281 --> 08:00.980
-You and me.
-Why?

08:01.581 --> 08:04.680
The council vote is next week,
after which I'm upstairs.

08:05.281 --> 08:07.180
Now, if I'm gonna give myself a chance...

08:07.280 --> 08:10.580
to make my mark on this place,
I'll need good people.

08:11.480 --> 08:13.180
People you can trust.

08:13.480 --> 08:15.280
And you ain't that?

08:16.580 --> 08:18.880
All right. You're a snake.

08:19.879 --> 08:22.479
But you seem to know your business.

08:22.579 --> 08:25.080
I'm taking the bar exam in a month.

08:25.680 --> 08:27.579
Why not put it off for a year or two...

08:27.679 --> 08:30.579
Ieave the department
with a major's pension?

08:31.279 --> 08:33.779
Scalise is gonna retire this summer.

08:34.179 --> 08:37.078
You do me a good turn
on this detail in southeast...

08:37.379 --> 08:39.477
and you'll have that posting.

08:39.578 --> 08:41.379
Why would you do that?

08:41.479 --> 08:43.178
I value you, Cedric.

08:44.379 --> 08:47.579
You're arrogant and disloyal.

08:48.279 --> 08:51.379
But maybe, given time,
you'll find a way to shine.

08:52.778 --> 08:55.479
-What's the detail?
-Drug case, probably.

08:56.078 --> 08:58.378
My sense of it is that Stan Valchek has got...

08:58.478 --> 09:01.678
some personal issues with somebody
in one of the port unions.

09:01.778 --> 09:03.778
He thinks they've got too much money.

09:03.878 --> 09:06.878
And so, being Valchek, he gets a detail.

09:07.578 --> 09:09.577
That it? Pretty thin.

09:09.977 --> 09:12.678
I don't care if you make a case
for Valchek or not.

09:12.777 --> 09:15.978
I do care that the old Polack
comes away from it...

09:16.078 --> 09:18.478
feeling he got his money's worth.

09:20.277 --> 09:22.977
Valchek asked for me by name, didn't he?

09:23.677 --> 09:27.177
You two are trading horses
and you need me in the corral.

09:33.777 --> 09:35.177
How about this?

09:37.276 --> 09:39.077
If I bring in the case...

09:39.477 --> 09:42.477
you make the detail permanent
as a major case unit...

09:42.577 --> 09:44.076
within CID.

09:44.176 --> 09:45.477
Fair enough.

09:45.577 --> 09:48.276
Just keep Valchek stroked
and make sure you bring in...

09:48.376 --> 09:50.376
-a drug case or two.
-One other thing.

09:50.476 --> 09:53.876
A promotion and the promise
of a specialized unit isn't enough?

09:54.576 --> 09:56.475
I choose my own people.

09:58.376 --> 10:00.676
Fuck me once, shame on you.

10:01.076 --> 10:03.275
-Fuck me twice--
-Make a list.

10:03.575 --> 10:06.475
Give it to Rawls. He'll pull who you want.

10:21.875 --> 10:24.675
The shit do not make sense.
Some of them wasn't about nothing.

10:24.775 --> 10:27.574
I mean, Tae? Lizard? lf it was a hotshot...

10:27.675 --> 10:30.474
they were after
some real lightweight motherfucks.

10:30.874 --> 10:32.975
Yo, Dee, you want any Silver Surfers?

10:33.075 --> 10:35.575
They tossing shit Tae had in his cell, man.

10:39.475 --> 10:42.174
Whoever load that shit up
didn't know what he was doing.

10:42.274 --> 10:46.374
My boy down the infirmary say the shit
was more rat poison than it was dope.

11:02.774 --> 11:04.373
Fucking-A right.

11:16.772 --> 11:18.573
Jane Doe, number five.

11:23.073 --> 11:24.372
Five.

11:38.772 --> 11:40.371
What's up, baby?

11:45.972 --> 11:47.571
Not here, put it away.

11:48.772 --> 11:50.771
Shot and a beer, darling.

11:53.072 --> 11:54.771
Kept one for yourself, did you?

11:54.871 --> 11:57.571
Them Japs, they make a nice little camera,
they do.

11:57.671 --> 12:00.971
-You even got film in that bitch?
-No, it's digital.

12:01.271 --> 12:03.071
I know it's digital, so what?

12:03.171 --> 12:06.571
So, no film, look,
there's a computer chip inside.

12:07.070 --> 12:09.771
You take that off,
you load the pictures onto the computer.

12:09.871 --> 12:10.970
Thanks.

12:14.070 --> 12:15.270
Ziggy.

12:16.971 --> 12:19.471
Don't spread no cash around
for a while, all right?

12:19.571 --> 12:21.170
Hell, no.

12:21.270 --> 12:24.670
I might get a new clutch plate
put in Princess is all.

12:25.670 --> 12:28.970
-Also, your father knows.
-How does he know?

12:29.070 --> 12:30.769
Horse saw us, right?

12:33.570 --> 12:35.170
Fuck me, he told?

12:35.270 --> 12:38.269
How long has Horse been tight
with your pop? Of course he told.

12:38.970 --> 12:41.969
He's pissed, Zig. He ain't happy.

12:42.469 --> 12:43.969
What did you say?

12:46.269 --> 12:48.869
I told him we already
turned the cameras around...

12:48.969 --> 12:51.369
and after a while, he stopped yelling.

12:51.469 --> 12:53.169
At you, maybe.

12:55.569 --> 12:56.569
Anyway.

12:57.868 --> 12:59.969
It's low profile for a while, all right?

13:00.069 --> 13:01.268
All right.

13:07.768 --> 13:10.968
You take a picture on that,
you don't have to take it to photomart...

13:11.068 --> 13:14.168
-to get it turned around?
-No, it goes on a computer.

13:20.767 --> 13:22.568
I got to take a leak.

13:26.268 --> 13:27.867
I go next, all right?

13:48.667 --> 13:51.266
Pretty boy. Hey, there.

13:51.966 --> 13:53.467
Christ, Ziggy.

14:02.066 --> 14:03.967
Jimmy, just a scheduling thing.

14:04.067 --> 14:07.066
Sean was invited to Mark Lohrman's
birthday party on Saturday.

14:07.166 --> 14:08.966
So you can pick him up there after 2:00.

14:09.066 --> 14:12.466
I realize it's your weekend,
but Sean would be upset if he missed it.

14:12.566 --> 14:13.966
Okay? Great.

14:15.366 --> 14:19.166
Omar by the end of the week, Jimmy.
Ilene is on the warpath.

14:19.466 --> 14:21.565
Motherfucker, I am serious.

14:22.865 --> 14:25.265
Mr. McNulty, this is Dr. Halpern's office.

14:25.365 --> 14:27.466
You missed your six-month cleaning
on Tuesday...

14:27.566 --> 14:28.765
and we haven't heard from you.

14:28.865 --> 14:30.465
Give us a call, please.

14:31.265 --> 14:33.865
McNulty, this is your dear friend
llene Nathan.

14:34.065 --> 14:35.865
I indicted this piece-of-shit case...

14:35.965 --> 14:38.765
because you swore to me
we had an eyeball witness....

14:48.664 --> 14:52.064
Drive time is 6:38 in the a.m.
and we have reports of a....

15:07.864 --> 15:10.664
-Go around, asshole.
-What'd you call me?

15:12.063 --> 15:13.864
I'm sleeping on this side.

15:13.964 --> 15:16.763
Because you got to get up, everybody does?

15:19.763 --> 15:20.864
Yup.

15:29.263 --> 15:31.762
Wipe off the seat, Nick, I know you hit it.

15:37.663 --> 15:40.863
-If I could fart now, I would.
-That's a surprise.

15:44.563 --> 15:46.562
No chance for breakfast?

15:46.862 --> 15:49.062
No. I'll stop by the bar.

15:49.162 --> 15:51.362
No, you won't. You ain't got time.

15:51.461 --> 15:53.762
You got to run me past my ma's
to pick up Ashley.

15:53.862 --> 15:57.062
Shit, hurry up, then.
You know I got a ship to work today.

15:57.862 --> 16:00.262
Your ma knows you got a ship, too.

16:02.061 --> 16:04.162
Don't go upstairs. Just head out the back.

16:04.262 --> 16:07.262
I'll pick you up at the back
of the alley, all right?

16:09.861 --> 16:12.161
Jesus, Nicky, we got a kid together.

16:12.461 --> 16:15.361
What's the big deal we spend the night
in your folks' basement?

16:15.461 --> 16:17.361
They're decent people.

16:29.560 --> 16:32.360
-We ain't got time.
-I know.

16:32.460 --> 16:36.260
-So, why you grabbing?
-They were staring right at me.

16:49.660 --> 16:51.560
I'll meet you out back.

16:54.260 --> 16:57.160
So how do you get the container
off the ship, off the dock?

16:57.260 --> 16:59.759
I guess if you wanted
to make sure your cargo...

16:59.859 --> 17:02.959
isn't messed with, you'd want to get
with one of the checkers.

17:03.059 --> 17:05.060
-Who are they?
-Local 1514.

17:05.160 --> 17:07.358
They monitor
all the loading and offloading...

17:07.459 --> 17:10.059
they match the manifests,
they tally the cargo.

17:10.159 --> 17:12.959
Nothing goes in or out
without them putting it down somewhere.

17:13.059 --> 17:14.659
-Or not.
-Or not.

17:15.657 --> 17:17.659
So we need to talk to a checker.

17:18.159 --> 17:19.258
What?

17:19.758 --> 17:22.758
Black, white, Polish, lrish, ltalian,
it doesn't matter.

17:23.058 --> 17:24.559
No one talks to police.

17:25.657 --> 17:27.558
How do you make a case then?

17:29.158 --> 17:30.858
I patrol.

17:31.458 --> 17:32.758
I write traffic tickets.

17:32.858 --> 17:35.858
If we got an open container,
or a damaged container...

17:35.958 --> 17:37.258
I take a report.

17:37.358 --> 17:39.658
We got something stolen,
I take another report.

17:39.758 --> 17:44.258
Someone gets something dropped on him
or gets run over by a front-end loader...

17:44.358 --> 17:46.457
-I keep writing.
-That's the job?

17:49.057 --> 17:50.257
How long you been on?

17:50.357 --> 17:53.357
-Two years.
-What did you do before that?

17:55.158 --> 17:58.357
I took tolls from people
at the Fort McHenry tunnel.

17:58.856 --> 18:01.657
Which, I'm happy to say,
wasn't nearly as much fun.

18:02.057 --> 18:04.357
Made $22,500
and went home tired every night...

18:04.457 --> 18:06.957
until I walked by the office bulletin board
one night...

18:07.057 --> 18:08.557
read the MDOT job posting.

18:08.657 --> 18:12.756
Port Authority officers, Schedule one,
starting at $33,000 with benefits.

18:14.357 --> 18:16.456
Toll-taking days were over?

18:19.356 --> 18:22.556
Father of my two kids
went to Houston in '99...

18:22.756 --> 18:25.456
hasn't so much as called in three years.

18:25.556 --> 18:27.356
I wasn't gonna make it on $22,500.

18:27.556 --> 18:29.155
Not with kids, I wasn't.

18:31.256 --> 18:33.355
Did you want to be a police?

18:57.855 --> 18:59.554
-Could've been me the other night.
-True.

19:00.354 --> 19:04.254
Except for all of a sudden,
you up and tell me to stop doing that.

19:04.354 --> 19:06.854
Avon to the rescue. How did you know?

19:07.654 --> 19:10.254
I figured you were gonna be
bringing your ass in here...

19:10.354 --> 19:12.355
to thank me for pulling you off of that shit.

19:12.455 --> 19:15.254
Five dead. More in the infirmary.

19:15.354 --> 19:18.554
-How did you know?
-I did as your uncle should...

19:18.754 --> 19:21.754
because I'm concerned about
you fucking yourself up.

19:22.254 --> 19:23.653
You knew.

19:24.454 --> 19:27.053
Look, man, I ain't had nothing to do with it.

19:27.453 --> 19:29.553
I might know who did, though.

19:29.653 --> 19:32.254
You practically running this place.
Who else could it be?

19:33.353 --> 19:36.253
It ain't about what happened,
you understand?

19:37.053 --> 19:40.153
It's about using what happened
to our advantage.

19:40.353 --> 19:41.953
Play or you gonna get played.

19:42.053 --> 19:44.153
I need to know that you ain't do that shit.

19:44.253 --> 19:45.453
That's what I need to know.

19:45.553 --> 19:48.753
I already said it.
You ain't gonna believe it, fuck it.

19:49.053 --> 19:52.952
You can tell yourself that I spiked it,
but be grateful that you still standing.

19:53.052 --> 19:54.552
Once you done with all that...

19:54.653 --> 19:57.652
we can talk about how we start
shaving some of these years off.

19:57.752 --> 19:59.452
And not just for me, for you, too.

19:59.552 --> 20:02.553
They looking for the motherfucker
who brought that shit in here.

20:02.653 --> 20:04.452
They need him to fall. And you know what?

20:04.652 --> 20:07.552
I can give you a name.
I can give you the right name.

20:07.752 --> 20:10.452
We can take that name
down to the assistant warden...

20:10.652 --> 20:13.051
and we can get some of our lives back.

20:13.852 --> 20:15.052
You dig?

20:17.251 --> 20:19.851
So, stay close.

20:19.951 --> 20:22.352
This play on the inside,
this play on the outside...

20:22.452 --> 20:24.351
we got it all covered.

20:27.651 --> 20:31.151
I don't want no part of what you do no more.
You hear me?

20:32.251 --> 20:34.751
So you can just leave me
the fuck out of that.

20:34.851 --> 20:36.350
Whatever it is.

21:07.249 --> 21:08.850
Anyone seen Omar?

21:15.950 --> 21:17.449
We're back in!

21:19.949 --> 21:21.549
Six ships in one day.

21:22.449 --> 21:25.349
Ain't seen the terminal this busy in months.
Feels sweet.

21:25.549 --> 21:27.649
Shit, look at this pretty bitch.

21:28.449 --> 21:31.649
-What the fuck are you wearing?
-Italian leather, all right?

21:32.049 --> 21:34.048
In the middle of winter?
On the goddamn docks?

21:34.148 --> 21:36.449
-How much does that shit cost?
-$2,000.

21:36.549 --> 21:39.549
For a goddamn jacket?
Are you out your fucking mind, Zig?

21:40.148 --> 21:41.248
Fuck it.

21:41.348 --> 21:43.748
$2,000 for a single goddamn jacket.

21:43.948 --> 21:46.449
Jesus, Zig, you need therapy and shit.

21:46.748 --> 21:50.247
I figured an African-American
such as yourself would understand...

21:50.348 --> 21:53.647
how a player such as myself
needs to take heed in the latest fashion.

21:53.747 --> 21:56.947
But apparently,
you ain't got no fucking style neither.

21:57.047 --> 21:59.848
-I'm gonna walk, all right?
-See you.

22:03.148 --> 22:04.147
What?

22:04.647 --> 22:07.047
What did I tell you about
not spreading no cash around?

22:07.147 --> 22:10.048
Jesus Christ, Nicky, it's a fucking coat.

22:11.447 --> 22:14.947
I can tell people I'm paying for it
on installments or whatever.

22:16.247 --> 22:19.047
But you got to admit, I do look pretty today.

22:19.147 --> 22:20.246
I do.

22:26.647 --> 22:28.346
The Greeks wanna talk to us.

22:28.546 --> 22:29.847
What about?

22:30.846 --> 22:32.246
We did good by them.

22:32.747 --> 22:33.846
Yeah?

22:35.346 --> 22:37.546
But, for Christ sakes, Zig,
keep your shit quiet...

22:37.646 --> 22:40.546
before half the fucking waterfront's
talking about us.

22:40.746 --> 22:42.346
All right, no problem.

22:43.645 --> 22:46.446
-All right. See you later.
-See you.

23:10.844 --> 23:12.245
Yo, quit it.

23:18.044 --> 23:19.045
Gentlemen.

23:20.045 --> 23:21.844
We don't need that now.

23:21.944 --> 23:24.144
-Say what?
-I don't give a shit about drugs.

23:24.344 --> 23:27.544
Littering pisses me off, though.
You can pick that up when I'm gone.

23:27.644 --> 23:30.244
I'm looking for a stick-up boy,
name of Omar.

23:30.543 --> 23:33.644
Dark-skinned, thin guy
with a scar right down his face.

23:34.143 --> 23:36.444
You boys would definitely know him
if you saw him...

23:36.544 --> 23:38.844
because he's got a shotgun about yea-long.

23:38.944 --> 23:42.444
He'll put it to your head
and steal your shit without thinking twice.

23:42.544 --> 23:44.243
Does anyone know where he hangs?

23:45.243 --> 23:47.144
Who he's running with?

23:50.444 --> 23:51.843
What he's driving?

23:52.643 --> 23:54.143
Fuck you, Officer.

24:00.742 --> 24:02.943
The second package came
even weaker than the last.

24:03.043 --> 24:04.842
It won't take the cut like it did before.

24:04.942 --> 24:08.042
Fucking Atlanta shit cost more
and still not as good.

24:09.243 --> 24:10.643
Came in at 25.

24:10.742 --> 24:12.742
All we can do is sprinkle it and bag it.

24:12.842 --> 24:14.142
And lose my money?

24:14.742 --> 24:16.042
I lose my money.

24:19.442 --> 24:20.842
Step on that motherfucker.

24:20.942 --> 24:22.142
How hard?

24:23.842 --> 24:25.042
Make it 10.

24:25.142 --> 24:27.242
-It's shit now.
-I know.

24:37.741 --> 24:41.541
So the container itself leads us nowhere.
Fake addresses on either end.

24:41.841 --> 24:43.942
Which leaves us the port itself.

24:44.341 --> 24:47.341
Because whatever went wrong
on that ship was known to whoever...

24:47.441 --> 24:49.241
was supposed to pick that container up.

24:49.341 --> 24:51.340
Which is why it stays on the dock.

24:51.440 --> 24:56.141
Bottom line is, we need to know more
about cargo moving off that terminal.

24:56.241 --> 24:59.240
How to do dirt.
And how to hide when you're doing dirt.

25:02.140 --> 25:04.141
Bottom line for me is different.

25:04.740 --> 25:08.940
Bottom line for me is,
you guys should've held that ship.

25:09.040 --> 25:12.340
For your crime scene, for your witnesses,
for the whole damn case.

25:12.440 --> 25:13.540
Sir, the witnesses--

25:13.640 --> 25:16.140
I don't care if they were
speaking Mandarin Chinese...

25:16.240 --> 25:17.640
with a cocksucker's lisp.

25:17.739 --> 25:21.239
They needed to see the inside of
an interrogation room. They were the case.

25:21.339 --> 25:23.840
We were in Philadelphia,
with no real jurisdiction...

25:23.940 --> 25:26.740
dealing with foreign nationals
and no real probable cause.

25:26.840 --> 25:30.240
I can only tell you
what it looks like from where I sit.

25:31.040 --> 25:34.739
And from here, the view is
two of my detectives fucking the dog.

25:36.139 --> 25:40.339
Thirteen homicides, 14, if we connect
the floater, and all of them red.

25:42.039 --> 25:43.539
So what can I tell you?

25:43.639 --> 25:46.939
If this case doesn't fall,
we're all gonna be stepping on our dicks...

25:47.039 --> 25:48.638
trying to explain what happened.

25:50.539 --> 25:53.539
So, work it as you see fit...

25:54.738 --> 25:56.038
but understand...

25:56.638 --> 25:59.338
if I have to throw Burrell
a scapegoat or two...

25:59.738 --> 26:01.139
I got one to throw.

26:20.338 --> 26:21.637
Fuck me.

26:59.736 --> 27:01.436
What did you want to talk to us about?

27:01.536 --> 27:05.035
If you are able to do like you did,
we have other things we can use.

27:05.135 --> 27:06.035
Like what?

27:06.135 --> 27:09.635
Fact is, we shook things up down there
snatching all them cameras.

27:10.135 --> 27:13.435
It comes to expensive shit like that,
we got to lay back for a while.

27:13.535 --> 27:15.535
Stuff we need is not like that.

27:16.035 --> 27:17.035
No?

27:20.435 --> 27:24.335
Acetone, sulfuric acid,
potassium permanganate.

27:24.435 --> 27:27.335
-Chemicals?
-It's like paint thinner, shit like that.

27:27.435 --> 27:30.835
What do you need with those?
Just go get them at the hardware store.

27:30.935 --> 27:33.234
No. We need much.

27:34.235 --> 27:37.234
Metric tons. Five or ten tons.

27:37.835 --> 27:40.034
Check and you'll see,
they make these things here.

27:40.134 --> 27:43.534
Send them from here.
Tanks and tanks down at your docks.

27:46.534 --> 27:48.334
Good money for those.

27:52.834 --> 27:53.834
How much?

27:56.233 --> 27:59.433
How much chemical? Two tons? Four?

28:00.033 --> 28:02.033
-Eight?
-I'll look into it.

28:22.032 --> 28:23.432
Yo, Bubbles!

28:25.732 --> 28:27.032
McNulty.

28:28.633 --> 28:30.132
My meanest man.

28:32.432 --> 28:33.932
Get in the car.

28:37.432 --> 28:39.232
Where you been at, brother?

28:44.732 --> 28:47.532
What did you get? Walkman.

28:49.831 --> 28:53.631
You know how it works, Bubs.
You're going to pay taxes on this shit.

28:54.031 --> 28:57.031
Taxation without representation, you know?

28:57.131 --> 28:59.431
I don't want much. I need Omar.

29:00.431 --> 29:01.731
Wild Omar?

29:03.131 --> 29:04.931
You want us to wander around town...

29:05.031 --> 29:07.731
Iooking for a crazy motherfucker
with a shotgun?

29:07.831 --> 29:10.031
Him and me go way back,
it's a friendly thing.

29:10.131 --> 29:12.830
If he's a friend,
you can find the motherfucker without us.

29:12.930 --> 29:16.630
No problem. Show me the receipt
for this shit, you're off the hook.

29:20.630 --> 29:22.930
-Here.
-Keep it, part of my tax.

29:23.830 --> 29:25.431
Your tax is Omar.

29:26.930 --> 29:29.129
I need a line by Friday, Bubs.

29:32.729 --> 29:33.730
Fuck!

29:33.830 --> 29:33.930
My client will provide accurate information
as to the source of the tainted narcotics.

29:33.930 --> 29:38.030
My client will provide accurate information
as to the source of the tainted narcotics.

29:38.130 --> 29:41.030
He can identify the method
by which contraband is smuggled...

29:41.130 --> 29:43.729
into this institution,
as well as the people responsible.

29:43.829 --> 29:45.430
Cellblock talk is cheap.

29:45.530 --> 29:47.529
He'll give you what you need
to make a case...

29:47.629 --> 29:50.529
-if that's what you're interested in.
-Your terms?

29:50.629 --> 29:53.429
Mr. Barksdale is due
for a first parole hearing at 28 months.

29:53.529 --> 29:55.329
We'd like to trim that to a year...

29:55.429 --> 29:57.829
and have your assurances
of institutional support...

29:57.929 --> 30:00.028
for work release and early parole.

30:00.229 --> 30:01.929
One year on a seven-year bit?

30:02.329 --> 30:04.929
We are offering extraordinary cooperation
in this matter.

30:05.029 --> 30:07.228
Mr. Barksdale's placing himself at risk...

30:07.428 --> 30:09.828
by offering information
implicating other prisoners...

30:09.928 --> 30:11.528
and staff at MCl.

30:11.628 --> 30:16.028
And I would only add that
Mr. Barksdale's extant conviction is his first.

30:16.128 --> 30:17.928
He has no priors whatsoever.

30:18.928 --> 30:22.827
It's my recollection that a city police
got shot behind Mr. Barksdale's business.

30:22.927 --> 30:25.328
-No, sir.
-You don't remember that?

30:25.928 --> 30:27.728
I remember the officer got shot.

30:27.828 --> 30:31.628
And I remember being upset about that,
not only because the officer got shot...

30:31.728 --> 30:34.727
but because I knew it meant
there was gonna be more police on me.

30:34.828 --> 30:38.427
I remember thinking, "Any time any fool
do something like shoot a police...

30:38.627 --> 30:39.727
"it's bad on everyone."

30:39.927 --> 30:42.127
I know that you know
that my name ain't nowhere...

30:42.227 --> 30:44.527
on what happened to your friend.

30:46.126 --> 30:49.626
I think what we're asking is reasonable
under the circumstances.

30:50.126 --> 30:53.526
After all, until someone identifies the source
of the tainted heroin...

30:53.626 --> 30:56.326
you could have
another five overdoses tomorrow.

30:56.526 --> 30:57.826
Or the day after.

30:59.826 --> 31:01.326
Consider the offer.

31:02.027 --> 31:03.426
But the next time we talk...

31:03.526 --> 31:06.426
an assistant attorney general
has to be in the room.

31:19.625 --> 31:21.126
Tuna surprise?

31:22.626 --> 31:25.526
Christ sakes, Ma,
I climbed all over two ships today.

31:26.026 --> 31:28.625
How about a meal for that kind of day?

31:33.325 --> 31:36.925
-Where's Pop?
-He's at the bar with the horses.

31:38.125 --> 31:40.024
Go tell him it's dinner.

32:02.624 --> 32:05.324
-We winning, Pop?
-Nicko.

32:05.924 --> 32:07.424
You up today?

32:07.824 --> 32:12.424
I was doing good,
but this year Gulfstream is killing me.

32:12.824 --> 32:15.023
Go easy. That's my inheritance.

32:17.123 --> 32:21.623
After 25 years, I'm still ahead almost $7,000.

32:21.723 --> 32:24.523
You ought to let me take you up to Pimlico
when it opens.

32:24.623 --> 32:26.523
Try your system out for real.

32:26.823 --> 32:28.123
Too tempting.

32:28.623 --> 32:29.923
Just once.

32:32.123 --> 32:36.123
Saw that the Cape Spruance
is over at Point West.

32:37.222 --> 32:39.323
Yeah, we offloaded her today.

32:45.322 --> 32:49.622
You know we double-hulled her
down at number four.

32:50.922 --> 32:54.122
Maybe two years before
the dry dock closed up.

32:55.122 --> 32:56.821
She still floats?

32:58.322 --> 33:00.121
Of course she still floats.

33:02.622 --> 33:04.021
You ever miss it, Pop?

33:04.021 --> 33:04.321
You ever miss it, Pop?

33:06.821 --> 33:08.521
Wouldn't do no good.

33:12.521 --> 33:13.921
What's for dinner?

33:14.821 --> 33:16.321
Tuna surprise.

33:28.921 --> 33:32.521
You're loyal to your people.
I respect that, at least.

33:35.320 --> 33:36.521
Don't worry, Lieutenant.

33:36.621 --> 33:39.020
Burrell wants you on this detail,
so I want you, too.

33:39.120 --> 33:41.520
I need your approval
for Freamon, Greggs, and Hauk.

33:41.620 --> 33:44.420
-They're all CID.
-Correction.

33:45.320 --> 33:48.920
You need my approval for everyone.
This may be Valchek's creation...

33:49.020 --> 33:52.020
but the detail is investigative
and comes under CID.

33:52.320 --> 33:55.019
If they work for me, they need my okay.

33:57.719 --> 34:01.219
Good news is, I got no problem
with anyone on your list.

34:02.619 --> 34:05.419
Except McNulty. No McNulty.

34:05.919 --> 34:08.518
Nothing that even resembles
the son of a bitch.

34:08.819 --> 34:11.619
-That bad?
-He quits or he drowns.

34:12.319 --> 34:16.018
That's the only two things get him
off the fucking boat, so help me God.

34:18.918 --> 34:21.717
You even know what
this detail's about, Lieutenant?

34:21.818 --> 34:23.619
Some kind of beef that Valchek has.

34:23.719 --> 34:26.418
Two fucking Polacks
pissing on each other's leg.

34:26.619 --> 34:28.118
I heard.

34:28.818 --> 34:31.618
Anything to get you
out of the basement, Lieutenant?

34:46.618 --> 34:47.717
Girl.

34:54.817 --> 34:57.318
No! Kima, who cares?

34:58.717 --> 35:02.517
We're gonna be there in five minutes
and they'll still be dumbass frat boys.

35:02.617 --> 35:05.317
You got to start thinking,
what would a lawyer do?

35:05.517 --> 35:07.317
What would a lawyer say?

35:08.216 --> 35:10.617
Shakima Greggs, Esquire.

35:11.516 --> 35:13.717
That's what I'm talking about.

35:24.516 --> 35:26.916
-Get your ass down, fool.
-Fuck you, lady.

35:34.315 --> 35:35.716
Ain't no lady.

35:39.315 --> 35:42.615
-Bitch, drive it or lose it.
-Oh, my God, let's get out of here.

35:49.715 --> 35:54.315
Only the finest breeds can perform this well,
with this much heart and obedience.

35:55.315 --> 35:58.915
Obedience that brings out the champion
not only in show dogs....

35:59.015 --> 36:03.615
Look at that tiger go. A third generation
champion from Glassport.

36:03.715 --> 36:07.615
Even house pets that never knew
they had the blood of champions in them.

36:08.014 --> 36:09.514
To perform at this level...

36:09.614 --> 36:12.214
an animal has to follow orders
without question.

36:12.314 --> 36:13.414
It is not instinct.

36:13.514 --> 36:14.714
Come on upstairs.

36:14.814 --> 36:16.614
All dogs have instinct.

36:22.714 --> 36:24.114
Jesus Christ.

36:38.513 --> 36:42.213
Nothing's on this side. Most chemicals
are over at the Fairfield terminals.

36:42.313 --> 36:44.113
Who do we know at Fairfield?

36:44.513 --> 36:47.613
Ott's brother-in-law works there.
You might try and touch him.

36:49.913 --> 36:51.812
What do they want with those for, anyway?

36:51.912 --> 36:53.913
Beats the fuck out of me.

36:57.113 --> 36:59.612
-Jesus, I'm sorry.
-Fuck, man, shit.

36:59.712 --> 37:02.812
I didn't see you standing there
in all that sweet leather.

37:03.512 --> 37:06.412
-What the fuck is wrong with you?
-Clumsy, I guess.

37:06.512 --> 37:09.512
You can just go out
and steal a whole can full of baby wipes...

37:09.612 --> 37:11.412
and just clean yourself up.

37:14.811 --> 37:16.512
You fucking goof.

37:17.112 --> 37:18.511
Dick.

37:23.111 --> 37:24.911
Shit, Lieutenant, I promised.

37:25.611 --> 37:29.011
Think my woman's gonna give
a great big cheer when she hears about it?

37:29.111 --> 37:31.711
-I was out the damn door.
-You don't know Cheryl.

37:31.811 --> 37:33.411
You don't know Marla.

37:33.911 --> 37:36.211
If you want...

37:36.411 --> 37:39.010
I could use you inside,
like we did Prez last year.

37:39.111 --> 37:41.311
If I hear the music, I'm gonna dance.

37:52.510 --> 37:55.010
I'll tell your wife, if you tell mine.

38:06.310 --> 38:08.809
In the car, but not out in the open.

38:09.809 --> 38:11.310
Yo, Rock.

38:14.010 --> 38:15.909
Be subtle with it, man.

38:17.009 --> 38:19.809
-You know what subtle means?
-Laid back and shit.

38:34.309 --> 38:36.808
-Good tunes, Pop?
-Yeah.

38:37.409 --> 38:39.208
Thanks for the phones.

38:52.808 --> 38:54.908
I don't know, Bubs. I mean...

38:55.907 --> 38:58.308
if you go rolling over rocks...

38:58.707 --> 39:01.108
then you're gonna get bit by a snake, right?

39:02.407 --> 39:04.408
Got to pay that tax, Johnny.

39:07.607 --> 39:10.107
You got to give a working police his due.

39:15.507 --> 39:18.806
-So, Bee's working for Lamar?
-All of them work for Lamar.

39:19.006 --> 39:21.207
He got that whole corner to hisself.

39:21.607 --> 39:24.507
You saying the stash is across the street
in the low-rises?

39:24.607 --> 39:25.906
In the second court.

39:26.006 --> 39:29.506
They got it up in this one place
that got the boarded-up windows.

39:29.706 --> 39:32.107
How many doors down from the end?

39:34.006 --> 39:35.307
Three.

39:40.106 --> 39:41.406
Yo, Pops.

39:50.406 --> 39:54.806
Anyone got a line on that wild boy
who likes to pop the shotty?

39:55.905 --> 39:58.306
-Omar?
-Yeah, I need Omar.

39:58.406 --> 40:00.305
What do you want with Omar?

40:01.005 --> 40:02.805
Just want a word with him.

40:03.405 --> 40:04.905
Just a word.

40:05.905 --> 40:08.005
You want to get with Omar...

40:08.505 --> 40:10.905
you need to stand out
on one of them corners...

40:11.005 --> 40:12.904
with a big-ass package.

40:13.605 --> 40:16.404
You be talking to that nigger soon enough.

40:24.704 --> 40:26.404
You feel anything?

40:29.704 --> 40:31.004
Let's go.

40:34.304 --> 40:35.504
Come on.

40:59.703 --> 41:03.803
As agreed, the price of cooperation is
an agreement by the state parole officials...

41:03.903 --> 41:07.202
to move Mr. Barksdale's
first parole hearing forward by 12 months...

41:07.403 --> 41:10.402
and to credit him in the file
with cooperation in this matter.

41:10.502 --> 41:13.202
You can't make a case
on just some con's say so.

41:13.302 --> 41:14.902
We need the dope on the table.

41:15.002 --> 41:16.202
Of course you do.

41:16.302 --> 41:19.103
If, before the end of business today,
you effect a search...

41:19.203 --> 41:23.002
of Correctional Officer Tilghman's vehicle,
locker, and person...

41:23.102 --> 41:25.702
we are confident
sufficient evidence will be recovered.

41:25.802 --> 41:27.202
"We are confident"?

41:27.502 --> 41:30.301
As far as D.O.C. is concerned,
this is a fair deal...

41:30.401 --> 41:33.101
if it takes the overdoses off our plate.

41:34.101 --> 41:36.501
But if we come up empty on this....

41:37.701 --> 41:38.702
You won't.

41:44.901 --> 41:46.201
Five will get you ten...

41:46.401 --> 41:48.601
that's the motherfucker
that spiked the packages.

41:48.801 --> 41:50.301
You have proof of this?

41:50.901 --> 41:53.400
Then we make the case
that's there for us to make.

42:10.900 --> 42:13.700
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph. New Orleans.

42:18.000 --> 42:19.100
Lieutenant.

42:21.400 --> 42:25.400
-Welcome to the southeast.
-Major, I understand you asked for me.

42:26.200 --> 42:28.800
My son-in-law can't say enough
in your favor.

42:28.900 --> 42:32.099
And, of course, you did him
a good turn last year, right?

42:32.900 --> 42:36.200
-You want to tell me about this target?
-Frank Sobotka.

42:36.699 --> 42:38.599
A union man down at the port.

42:39.099 --> 42:43.698
The motherfucker's showing a lot of money.
My gut says a drug connection.

42:43.899 --> 42:46.998
I can also tell you for a fact
that his people...

42:47.398 --> 42:50.298
will up and steal anything
that isn't nailed down.

42:50.498 --> 42:53.198
-You seen the off-site?
-Not yet.

42:53.398 --> 42:55.599
I told my people to meet up here,
at the district.

42:55.799 --> 42:58.498
Pretty good digs. Come on, I'll show you.

43:02.998 --> 43:05.498
It's from a young woman to her mother...

43:05.898 --> 43:08.098
or at least an older woman.

43:08.698 --> 43:10.397
She mention any names?

43:11.698 --> 43:14.197
There is an Anya here.

43:14.397 --> 43:17.997
And from the way she writes,
I'm guessing it is a child.

43:19.598 --> 43:22.698
It's almost ready, Father. Excuse me.

43:30.597 --> 43:33.997
-So who's she writing to?
-There is no name.

43:34.397 --> 43:36.697
The letter is for the whole family.

43:37.496 --> 43:38.797
But...

43:42.497 --> 43:46.197
she signs, "Nadya." Her name is Nadya.

43:46.497 --> 43:48.796
-Nadya.
-Is she in trouble?

43:49.797 --> 43:51.096
She's dead.

43:52.596 --> 43:55.996
Anything in the letter to indicate
as to where these people live?

43:56.096 --> 43:58.496
If you had an envelope, I could....

43:59.396 --> 44:02.696
The only thing specific she mentions,
is a church...

44:02.796 --> 44:05.296
St. Volodymyr, or St. Vladimir, and a priest.

44:05.296 --> 44:06.696
St. Volodymyr, or St. Vladimir, and a priest.

44:07.295 --> 44:11.095
-Father Vasyl, it says.
-There's no names or places or....

44:11.195 --> 44:14.395
Across the water,
Father Vasyl is a common name...

44:14.795 --> 44:17.395
and there are many St. Volodymyrs.

44:20.395 --> 44:23.095
But leave the letter. I will try.

44:24.495 --> 44:25.795
Thank you.

44:30.694 --> 44:35.094
I'm saying, if there isn't enough work,
then you could do something else, that's all.

44:35.294 --> 44:36.995
There's enough work.

44:41.494 --> 44:43.994
Fact is, I came into
some back pay I was owed...

44:44.094 --> 44:45.894
from about a month ago.

44:45.994 --> 44:48.694
A couple thousand from
the vacation fund.

44:50.094 --> 44:51.394
Stop, Ash.

44:56.194 --> 44:57.993
I was thinking...

44:59.194 --> 45:02.193
maybe this'll be the time
for us to get a place.

45:02.293 --> 45:04.393
You could cover that?

45:04.993 --> 45:06.994
And maybe we don't rent.

45:07.493 --> 45:10.494
Maybe we try and buy something
in the neighborhood.

45:10.893 --> 45:13.293
Nothing too big, just....

45:16.093 --> 45:18.393
I heard Aunt Treesey's
old place up in Covington...

45:18.493 --> 45:20.493
has been fixed up real nice.

45:22.993 --> 45:25.392
Like with wood floors and all.

45:27.992 --> 45:30.892
Ash, what's that ship right there?

45:31.292 --> 45:34.792
-Cable ship.
-And what's the gray one next to it?

45:34.892 --> 45:36.392
Military Sealift.

45:37.392 --> 45:38.692
Attagirl.

45:41.492 --> 45:42.392
You cold?

45:48.791 --> 45:50.592
-Dwight?
-What's up?

45:50.891 --> 45:53.192
We're gonna have to
search your vehicle. Sorry.

45:53.292 --> 45:54.591
Search? What the fuck?

45:54.691 --> 45:57.392
Open it, or I'm gonna shim the lock,
maybe damage your ride.

45:57.491 --> 45:59.591
You got no call to be doing me like this.

45:59.691 --> 46:02.891
-No call and no damn warrant.
-You drive onto a D.O.C. facility...

46:02.991 --> 46:05.091
you acknowledge the vehicle's
subject to search.

46:05.191 --> 46:07.191
Where's the key, Dwight?

46:17.890 --> 46:19.891
He's gonna be back
from lunch any minute, Zig.

46:20.091 --> 46:21.990
You hear me? He sees you on that thing...

46:22.090 --> 46:24.790
he's gonna break you down
and sell you for parts.

46:51.589 --> 46:52.989
Here it be.

46:54.389 --> 46:56.589
You all planted that shit.

46:56.689 --> 46:58.689
You fucking know you did.

47:14.389 --> 47:17.188
-What's with the whistle squad?
-It's for us.

47:17.288 --> 47:19.788
They marked us the moment
we stepped out of the car.

47:19.988 --> 47:22.088
-That's him.
-That's Horseface?

47:22.988 --> 47:25.688
-How did he get the name?
-You need a close-up?

47:26.288 --> 47:27.688
Thomas Pakusa.

47:29.688 --> 47:31.687
We need to talk to you about something.

47:31.787 --> 47:32.887
What?

47:36.187 --> 47:39.187
You were working the Atlantic Light
when it docked, right?

47:39.287 --> 47:40.487
If you say so.

47:40.587 --> 47:42.687
You remember that container
that came off that day?

47:42.787 --> 47:44.887
-With all the dead girls.
-No.

47:44.987 --> 47:47.387
You don't remember
all them dead girls in a can?

47:47.487 --> 47:48.887
Come on, Horse.

47:48.987 --> 47:51.187
I remember when you found them all
in the stacks.

47:51.287 --> 47:53.787
I don't remember
they came off the Atlantic Light.

47:53.887 --> 47:56.587
Let's take a ride downtown,
clear this mess up.

47:56.687 --> 47:57.687
No.

48:00.187 --> 48:01.586
Get the fuck in the car.

48:01.686 --> 48:04.187
-Am I locked up?
-Get in the damn car.

48:04.287 --> 48:06.386
You want me in that car,
you need to lock me up.

48:06.486 --> 48:09.286
If that's the way it'll be,
I wanna talk to my shop steward...

48:09.386 --> 48:11.886
and he can have an IBS lawyer go with me.

48:16.686 --> 48:17.886
Dad, what--

48:18.285 --> 48:20.586
Jesus, Pop, what's that for?

48:21.186 --> 48:22.585
Say cheese.

48:22.685 --> 48:25.585
You pull another stunt like that, Zig,
I'll have your damn card.

48:25.785 --> 48:28.885
I don't care who your mother is.
Get the fuck out of here!

48:34.886 --> 48:37.385
Kind of smart for a fat man, isn't he?

48:37.485 --> 48:38.885
All right.

48:54.785 --> 48:57.384
Goddamn it, Ziggy, you sick fuck.

48:57.684 --> 48:59.784
Get your dick out of my computer!

49:09.684 --> 49:11.883
Where are the detectives
who were first assigned?

49:11.983 --> 49:15.283
Dead. To me, anyway.

49:15.383 --> 49:18.883
I shipped them humps back to Burrell
as fast as I could.

49:33.183 --> 49:34.683
What kept you?

49:35.382 --> 49:37.483
That's the beautiful thing
about this department.

49:37.683 --> 49:40.383
Every brain-dead
somehow manages to land on his feet.

49:40.483 --> 49:42.382
-How's it hanging, Prez?
-How're you doing?

49:42.482 --> 49:43.682
I'm all right.

49:43.782 --> 49:46.182
Where's Lester? We got him, too, right?

49:46.482 --> 49:48.782
He was out on the street
today with Homicide...

49:48.882 --> 49:51.282
but Rawls promised to give him
the bad news tomorrow.

49:51.382 --> 49:52.482
Not McNulty though.

49:52.582 --> 49:55.182
McNulty they really hate,
not that I blame them.

49:55.282 --> 49:57.282
You, of course,
have Roland for the duration.

49:57.382 --> 50:00.582
Anyone else from the southeastern
you need, you got.

50:03.482 --> 50:05.481
I'll leave you to it, then.

50:07.982 --> 50:11.482
Carver's in the southeast, now.
I think he's got Sector Two.

50:11.582 --> 50:14.081
It'd be great to have Carver on this, right?

50:14.281 --> 50:15.581
On what?

50:15.681 --> 50:18.880
We don't even know what the hell
we're supposed to be chasing here.

50:18.981 --> 50:21.581
No offense to your father-in-law,
but it's real thin.

50:21.681 --> 50:25.281
We're here, right? Whatever happens,
we run with the program for a few weeks.

50:25.381 --> 50:27.481
Maybe make a drug case or two
down by the port.

50:27.581 --> 50:29.780
Beats the hell out of E.C.U. anyway.

50:34.881 --> 50:37.780
Him and this lady have this daughter.
The daughter's born a mute.

50:37.880 --> 50:40.380
The wife doesn't like that at all,
so she breaks out.

50:40.480 --> 50:43.080
So this guy's raising his daughter,
she has her period...

50:43.180 --> 50:45.879
freaks out, goes to him,
he thinks she was raped--

50:45.980 --> 50:47.280
Jackpot.

50:48.580 --> 50:51.380
That's about $10 worth
of bulk metal right there.

50:51.480 --> 50:54.480
We just have to haul it down
to the scrap yard and we're good.

50:54.580 --> 50:56.579
We'll break our fucking backs on this thing.

50:56.679 --> 51:00.079
Keep your eye to the ground, okay?
I'm schooling you.

51:00.179 --> 51:01.380
Okay?

51:01.980 --> 51:03.679
This is good, right here.

51:04.679 --> 51:06.479
This is $10 right here.

51:09.479 --> 51:11.079
Snitching Bubs.

51:17.579 --> 51:19.378
You be asking for me?

52:07.677 --> 52:11.777
These headphones are great.
I'm gonna use them at the gym. Thanks.

52:14.877 --> 52:18.477
-You hear the boys?
-No, it's quiet up there.

52:19.476 --> 52:21.076
A little too quiet.

52:21.276 --> 52:23.676
That means they're probably
playing video games.

52:23.876 --> 52:25.676
Or with a book of matches.

52:27.776 --> 52:31.176
So, did you have a lawyer
look at the papers yet?

52:31.876 --> 52:33.075
I did.

52:35.776 --> 52:38.076
-And?
-He says I shouldn't sign it.

52:39.575 --> 52:41.575
Says I'm giving away too much.

52:42.276 --> 52:44.075
I would never, under any circumstances...

52:44.175 --> 52:46.975
pay that kind of support and alimony
if we went to court.

52:47.075 --> 52:48.475
That's what he says?

53:00.174 --> 53:01.975
Signed and notarized.

53:05.875 --> 53:08.174
I don't wanna argue about the money.

53:08.574 --> 53:10.574
I wanna get back together.

53:19.274 --> 53:20.173
Yeah.

53:26.473 --> 53:29.174
Yo, String, I was subtle with that.

53:30.073 --> 53:33.473
...has led to drug distribution charges
against three inmates...

53:33.573 --> 53:35.573
one who was, himself, incapacitated...

53:35.674 --> 53:38.573
by the tainted narcotics
and the correctional officer...

53:38.673 --> 53:39.674
a 10-year veteran.

53:39.774 --> 53:42.273
I've been instructed
by the Corrections Commissioner...

53:42.373 --> 53:44.673
and the State Public Safety Secretary...

53:44.873 --> 53:47.973
to announce that the maximum penalties...

53:48.173 --> 53:50.572
will be sought against this officer....

53:50.772 --> 53:53.073
I got a midterm. I got to study.

54:18.472 --> 54:21.871
-So this is their joint?
-What's the plan?

54:22.372 --> 54:26.172
Time to make it clear to these people
that we're not gonna go away.

54:49.071 --> 54:51.670
You ain't gonna play
that country shit, right?

54:51.870 --> 54:53.970
I hate that country shit.

54:54.870 --> 54:59.270
Not even Ray Charles
can save that mess for me.

55:02.670 --> 55:03.869
No, sir.

55:14.369 --> 55:18.569
Big Daddy Lipscomb was right tackle.
Your brain's gone to shit, Jessy.

55:19.269 --> 55:20.569
Left tackle.

55:20.769 --> 55:24.169
You was too busy pissing in your drawers
to learn left from right.

55:24.269 --> 55:27.669
Take your ass down to Schula's Steakhouse
and get an education.

55:27.769 --> 55:28.969
Darling.

55:33.569 --> 55:34.668
What's the deal?

55:34.768 --> 55:38.468
Just dropping in for one or two
and then we take ourselves out of here.

55:38.568 --> 55:40.568
How about you?

55:40.868 --> 55:42.668
I'm leaving after this one.

55:53.967 --> 55:57.168
You guys Port Police?
I don't recognize either one of you.

55:57.667 --> 56:00.268
-City Homicide.
-Homicide?

56:00.368 --> 56:03.268
-Who got killed?
-Those dead girls in the can.

56:03.967 --> 56:07.567
That was an accident.
That was a fucking accident.

56:07.867 --> 56:09.968
That's what I heard, anyway.

56:15.667 --> 56:17.067
Excuse me.
