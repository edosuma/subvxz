00:06.800 --> 00:10.500
It's Medusa, isn't it? Tell
me. Tell me it isn't her.

00:13.380 --> 00:16.120
She took her life to save Atlantis.

00:18.900 --> 00:21.410
~ How did you get in here?
~ I can't explain. We need to move fast.

00:21.460 --> 00:24.020
You will not kill me...

00:25.620 --> 00:28.020
.. because I am your mother.

00:56.980 --> 00:59.690
Medusa...

00:59.740 --> 01:05.650
aideomai se kai eukhomene

01:05.700 --> 01:06.850
kharin iskho.

01:06.900 --> 01:09.090
~ Medusa...
~ We have to go.

01:09.140 --> 01:11.300
~ What is it?
~ A patrol.

01:12.260 --> 01:13.450
An Atlantean patrol.

01:13.500 --> 01:15.500
~ How many?
~ Too many.

01:16.340 --> 01:18.480
Are you going to help?

01:19.900 --> 01:21.210
No.

01:21.260 --> 01:23.450
You flee if you want to.

01:23.500 --> 01:24.970
What are you doing?

01:25.020 --> 01:26.650
What we should have done ages ago.

01:26.700 --> 01:29.380
~ This is madness.
~ Then stay here!

01:30.370 --> 01:31.370
Always the hero.

01:31.420 --> 01:32.820
Jason...

01:33.980 --> 01:35.540
Jason!

01:37.460 --> 01:39.810
~ He cannot go alone.
~ He will be killed.

01:39.860 --> 01:41.210
We can't give up on him now.

01:41.260 --> 01:45.370
Give up on him?! We've risked
everything for that boy.

01:45.420 --> 01:47.220
And in return...

01:47.620 --> 01:51.340
No. He's made it quite clear he's happy
on his own, and that's fine by me.

01:54.940 --> 01:57.940
Hey! I thought I'd
save you the journey.

02:40.180 --> 02:41.650
Please...

02:44.180 --> 02:45.940
My Queen.

02:49.060 --> 02:50.460
Ariadne.

02:51.140 --> 02:52.810
He's unarmed.

02:53.300 --> 02:55.570
I wanted no part of this.

02:56.940 --> 02:58.480
Stand down.

02:59.980 --> 03:02.320
It is you I wish to serve.

03:03.060 --> 03:05.400
Come, we will not harm you.

03:10.540 --> 03:12.690
What are you doing?

03:19.900 --> 03:22.170
He was a defenceless boy!

03:25.860 --> 03:26.970
He tried to kill us.

03:27.020 --> 03:29.290
I told you to stand down.

03:34.060 --> 03:36.800
And who are you to give me orders?

03:57.460 --> 04:00.660
You're wasting your
time. They're gone.

04:01.620 --> 04:04.820
~ Is this true?
~ They're all dead.

04:06.300 --> 04:09.690
Well, well... What a hero you are!

04:09.740 --> 04:12.740
How many more dead
to add to your tally?

04:13.820 --> 04:15.010
Someone had to protect us.

04:15.060 --> 04:19.690
Protect us? And what'll happen
when they find the bodies, eh?

04:19.740 --> 04:22.490
You don't think they'll
come looking for us?

04:22.540 --> 04:26.810
All you've achieved is to rob
a lot of mothers of their sons

04:26.860 --> 04:29.690
and to tell Pasiphae
exactly where we are.

04:29.740 --> 04:31.370
This is no time for fighting.

04:31.420 --> 04:33.290
But he doesn't know any
other way, does he?

04:33.340 --> 04:36.250
It's not like he could
use his brain...

04:36.300 --> 04:37.890
Jason!

04:37.940 --> 04:40.480
..because he doesn't have one.

04:40.740 --> 04:44.850
That's right. Fall
back on what you know.

04:44.900 --> 04:47.890
Here... Why don't you
take my head as well?

04:47.940 --> 04:50.700
~ Jason...
~ No.

04:51.700 --> 04:53.090
It might not be as pretty.

04:53.140 --> 04:54.680
Or useful.

04:56.020 --> 04:57.780
No, no!

04:59.500 --> 05:00.650
I need to look at it.

05:00.700 --> 05:03.780
We need to move out! Which is what
we should have done all along!

05:08.900 --> 05:11.370
~ The patrol have not returned.
~ What does that mean?

05:11.420 --> 05:15.540
~ I do not know.
~ They are lost? Dead?
~ Possibly.
~ But Jason is not.

05:16.820 --> 05:19.730
He could be over the border by
now. How did we let this happen?

05:19.780 --> 05:22.170
~ All will be well.
~ For who?

05:22.220 --> 05:25.410
Jason knows I am his mother. He knows
he is the rightful heir to the throne.

05:25.460 --> 05:27.290
He also knows that he
is touched by the gods.

05:27.340 --> 05:30.570
He's drawn to us. I've
seen it with my own eyes.

05:30.620 --> 05:32.020
Perhaps.

05:33.020 --> 05:35.930
I remember when I first became aware
of my powers. I was so frightened.

05:35.980 --> 05:38.780
I could feel the darkness around me.

05:39.500 --> 05:42.730
~ I remember that, too.
~ That's how Jason feels right now.

05:42.780 --> 05:46.090
~ He will come to us.
~ Oh, I wish I had your faith.

05:46.140 --> 05:47.810
You will see.

05:49.940 --> 05:53.370
No, we cannot rely on Jason
to change allegiance.

05:53.420 --> 05:56.720
~ Given time, though...
~ My orders remain the same.

05:57.460 --> 06:00.200
We must find him, we must kill him.

06:09.700 --> 06:12.100
We'll need to hunt tomorrow.

06:17.220 --> 06:19.820
Do you think we'll be safe here?

06:25.060 --> 06:29.160
~ Is this how it's going to be?
~ I didn't ask for your company.

06:29.420 --> 06:30.650
Not now.

06:30.700 --> 06:33.170
And not earlier.

06:33.220 --> 06:36.220
Because you could have
defeated them alone?

06:37.660 --> 06:40.090
Because I am sick of taking orders.

06:40.140 --> 06:42.740
I assure you it will be my last.

06:48.020 --> 06:51.580
I have never seen you as someone
to order around. You know that.

06:54.860 --> 06:58.460
I have also never seen you
as a cold-hearted killer.

07:00.180 --> 07:03.180
What you have learned
about Pasiphae...

07:03.780 --> 07:06.380
It must have been a great shock.

07:07.020 --> 07:09.930
But you cannot let
it change who you are.

07:09.980 --> 07:13.680
~ The Jason I know and love...
~ I don't want any company.

07:26.780 --> 07:29.780
He does not deserve to be loved.

07:32.380 --> 07:34.140
I'm sorry.

07:36.980 --> 07:39.100
There. You will live.

07:40.420 --> 07:42.290
What's the point?

07:43.340 --> 07:46.820
I would rather join Medusa
than endure this any longer.

07:48.140 --> 07:49.880
Don't say that.

07:50.660 --> 07:52.600
She died for this.

07:53.820 --> 07:54.890
For this?!

07:54.940 --> 08:00.780
She sacrificed her own life so we might
live in peace. What good did it do?

08:02.620 --> 08:04.090
It is hard to tell at the moment.

08:04.140 --> 08:06.090
Pasiphae is still on the throne,

08:06.140 --> 08:08.810
Atlantis lies in ruin,

08:08.860 --> 08:13.210
and we're fugitives, stuck in a
forest with no food, no medicine.

08:13.260 --> 08:17.690
Just a stark raving
lunatic for company.

08:17.740 --> 08:20.500
It is as the Oracle foretold.

08:21.660 --> 08:25.160
Now that Jason knows the
truth about his mother...

08:25.340 --> 08:27.680
.. his heart is blackened.

08:28.420 --> 08:30.960
Then there's nothing we can do.

08:32.780 --> 08:35.120
He is lost to us for ever.

08:36.100 --> 08:38.240
I cannot believe that.

09:59.740 --> 10:03.300
It's all right. You're all
right. It was just a dream.

10:23.460 --> 10:25.570
I fail to see how this news
is supposed to please me.

10:25.620 --> 10:28.290
Who else would be using makeshift
arrows to defend themselves?

10:28.340 --> 10:30.930
Who else would be hiding
out in the forest

10:30.980 --> 10:33.010
like fugitives? We
are close, my Queen.

10:33.060 --> 10:35.130
But not close enough!

10:37.620 --> 10:40.560
~ Dispatch a patrol.
~ It is already done.

10:47.820 --> 10:50.810
I never thought I'd see
Jason attack his friends.

10:50.860 --> 10:53.290
He is not the Jason we know.

10:53.340 --> 10:55.410
We mustn't forget that.

10:55.460 --> 10:57.370
He was the Jason we know
when he killed Medusa.

10:57.420 --> 11:01.170
I know how you feel about him
right now, but you must remember

11:01.220 --> 11:03.250
what the Oracle said.

11:03.300 --> 11:06.600
Jason is the only person
who can save Atlantis.

11:09.300 --> 11:11.850
I'm going to find Melas.

11:11.900 --> 11:15.490
If anyone knows how to help
Jason, Melas surely will.

11:15.540 --> 11:18.140
~ If they find you...
~ They won't.

11:18.940 --> 11:21.970
~ I still have friends in the city.
~ What makes you think Melas'll help?

11:22.020 --> 11:25.820
Melas does not want to see Atlantis
fall any more than you or I.

11:27.060 --> 11:30.460
He could have turned me in when I
took Pandora's Box, but he didn't.

11:31.580 --> 11:32.810
I hope you're right.

11:32.860 --> 11:35.200
We have to try something...

11:35.540 --> 11:38.480
.. for Medusa's sake,
if nothing else.

12:08.300 --> 12:12.090
We don't have long. The guards
patrol every corner of the city.

12:12.140 --> 12:14.280
What news of Daedalus?

12:14.500 --> 12:16.090
He's suffering from a fever.

12:16.140 --> 12:17.650
He'll be fine.

12:17.700 --> 12:20.700
He has probably invented
a cure by now.

12:21.260 --> 12:22.730
I am sorry to come to you like this.

12:22.780 --> 12:26.050
My friend... you have
seen the way we live.

12:26.100 --> 12:28.500
I will do all I can to help.

12:29.740 --> 12:33.650
They're still enforcing the curfew. We
cannot move around the city after dark.

12:33.700 --> 12:36.130
~ What do you suggest?
~ I have a friend...

12:36.180 --> 12:38.050
A very useful friend.

12:38.100 --> 12:41.100
~ Someone we can trust?
~ Someone who may be...

12:41.860 --> 12:44.260
.. persuaded to stay silent.

12:45.420 --> 12:47.450
So, what does this friend do?

12:47.500 --> 12:50.300
What makes him immune to the curfew?

12:55.900 --> 12:57.700
Nobody stops me.

13:01.220 --> 13:04.050
Even Pasiphae wants her
city to smell nice.

13:04.100 --> 13:06.370
I'd be happy to help you.

13:08.820 --> 13:11.490
You know if we're caught, Pasiphae
will likely have us killed.

13:11.540 --> 13:15.580
Better make sure you're nicely
covered, then, hadn't we?

13:18.620 --> 13:21.090
I'll take you as far as I can.

13:21.140 --> 13:23.220
Keep your heads down.

13:39.460 --> 13:40.780
Halt!

13:44.620 --> 13:48.010
Beautiful night for it. Did
you ever see such a moon?

13:48.060 --> 13:52.210
~ Where are you headed?
~ Wherever the horses have been.

13:52.260 --> 13:55.300
Which, I don't mind telling you,
is pretty much everywhere.

13:56.380 --> 13:59.320
~ Under whose authority?
~ Why, the Queen.

14:00.540 --> 14:03.930
Tell me, where do you live?

14:03.980 --> 14:07.410
For a small consideration, I'll
give it an extra-special clean!

14:08.580 --> 14:10.920
All right, be on your way.

14:20.660 --> 14:23.690
I had hoped Pythagoras
would be back by now.

14:23.740 --> 14:27.700
Don't worry about him. He is
more skilled than he looks.

14:31.460 --> 14:33.800
You are thinking of Medusa?

14:36.820 --> 14:39.250
When I think about her sacrifice...

14:39.300 --> 14:42.800
Medusa's death may rest
heavy on your shoulders...

14:43.220 --> 14:46.220
.. but the fault does
not lay with you.

14:51.780 --> 14:54.980
It pains me to see the
two of you at odds.

14:57.620 --> 15:01.260
We must not allow ourselves
to be consumed with anger.

15:02.900 --> 15:05.530
If we turn against one another,
then Pasiphae has won.

15:05.580 --> 15:07.770
Indeed.

15:07.820 --> 15:09.420
She has won.

15:10.460 --> 15:12.330
Good luck to her.

15:13.540 --> 15:16.640
May her power bring
her much happiness...

15:25.780 --> 15:28.520
This is it. This is as far as I go.

15:29.340 --> 15:30.610
Halt!

15:36.020 --> 15:37.410
Beautiful evening for it.

15:37.460 --> 15:39.180
Huh...

15:40.500 --> 15:43.940
The streets are quiet,
the stars are out.

15:46.300 --> 15:48.140
Missed a spot.

15:49.980 --> 15:51.250
Oh...

15:52.540 --> 15:54.900
Keep up the good work.

16:12.300 --> 16:14.210
Hey!

16:28.220 --> 16:30.290
Thank you, my friend.

16:34.740 --> 16:36.210
You will return.

16:36.260 --> 16:38.000
I will return.

16:39.180 --> 16:40.450
Do not fear.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.330
Until later.

16:42.380 --> 16:45.020
May the gods be with you.

17:17.859 --> 17:20.849
~ Why are you here?
~ I am here because of Jason.

17:20.900 --> 17:24.530
You have seen how the people
live - amongst rotting corpses,

17:24.579 --> 17:27.319
with barely enough food to survive.

17:27.940 --> 17:29.970
Jason is the only one
who can help them,

17:30.020 --> 17:33.020
but Jason is no longer
the man we knew.

17:33.540 --> 17:35.130
He knows the truth about Pasiphae?

17:35.180 --> 17:37.380
His heart has blackened.

17:38.580 --> 17:41.050
It is as the Oracle foretold.

17:41.540 --> 17:43.450
Those who are touched by the gods

17:43.500 --> 17:47.300
are drawn to one another by
forces they cannot control.

17:47.580 --> 17:50.700
I fear for him. I fear for all of us.

17:52.860 --> 17:55.400
If he were to join Pasiphae...

17:55.740 --> 17:58.380
There must be a way to help him.

18:10.220 --> 18:15.780
Nun dunamin dos emoi mekhri
peusomai hatta genoito.

18:18.820 --> 18:21.920
What is it? What did
you see? Is there a way?

18:23.820 --> 18:25.890
The gods have spoken.

18:29.540 --> 18:32.410
I feel Jason's pain.

18:32.460 --> 18:35.380
He stands on a threshold.

18:37.140 --> 18:40.090
On one side is the light
of the life he has known,

18:40.140 --> 18:44.020
and on the other is the darkness
that draws him to Pasiphae.

18:46.020 --> 18:48.130
The lure of that darkness is strong.

18:48.180 --> 18:52.450
~ I refuse to believe that.
~ Peace, my friend. Be still and listen.

18:52.500 --> 18:55.600
But no force can thrive
without its opposite.

18:57.300 --> 19:01.380
~ You must find that opposite.
~ I don't understand.

19:02.900 --> 19:05.170
The mother's love that
would draw him to darkness

19:05.220 --> 19:07.890
is but the mirror of the father's
that would make it whole again.

19:07.940 --> 19:10.130
Jason's father is dead.

19:10.180 --> 19:13.420
He alone can draw Jason
back into the light.

19:14.420 --> 19:16.360
That's impossible.

19:17.860 --> 19:19.930
He is your only hope.

19:23.580 --> 19:26.210
He's dead. The Oracle told Jason so.

19:26.260 --> 19:30.810
It is true, that is what she said.
His father walks amongst the dead.

19:30.860 --> 19:34.060
The Oracle cannot lie
about what she has seen.

19:34.940 --> 19:40.330
There are those who suffer
the torments of death in life,

19:40.380 --> 19:43.290
who hide themselves
away from the world.

19:43.340 --> 19:44.940
He is alive?

19:46.420 --> 19:48.960
I believe you have already met.

19:49.380 --> 19:51.720
He is one of the unclean...

19:52.460 --> 19:54.860
.. for whom life is a curse.

19:55.540 --> 19:57.420
He is a leper.

19:59.340 --> 20:02.690
You will find him in the
old silver mines of Pangeon.

20:02.740 --> 20:04.770
In the Mountains of Galena.

20:04.820 --> 20:06.360
Thank you.

20:12.980 --> 20:16.340
May the gods look kindly on you
for what you have done today.

20:23.780 --> 20:25.850
Ariadne will not forget
what you have done for us.

20:25.900 --> 20:27.840
And neither will I.

20:32.620 --> 20:35.720
This should last you
to the silver mines.

20:36.100 --> 20:38.640
What do you hope to find there?

20:39.340 --> 20:42.210
Peace... for all of us.

20:42.260 --> 20:45.090
Well, may we meet again
in those times.

20:45.140 --> 20:48.240
That is the thought
I will carry with me.

21:30.540 --> 21:32.010
Father...

21:36.380 --> 21:38.330
What happened?

21:38.380 --> 21:39.580
Shh.

21:42.380 --> 21:45.380
We... We had a slight disagreement.

21:47.500 --> 21:52.810
His knowledge of even the most basic
chemical compounds is pitiful.

21:52.860 --> 21:54.930
I don't know how he's managed
to live this long.

21:54.980 --> 21:57.850
By not blowing things up.

21:57.900 --> 22:00.490
Yes, well, I am very
proud of that explosion.

22:00.540 --> 22:03.170
Well, I'm glad about that, because
you're going to hang for it.

22:03.220 --> 22:07.810
Hmm. Well, maybe at the last moment

22:07.860 --> 22:10.860
I'll discover how to
make myself invisible.

22:14.500 --> 22:16.300
The date is set.

22:18.020 --> 22:20.140
Sunrise tomorrow.

22:21.460 --> 22:23.400
Be strong, my son.

22:24.180 --> 22:26.540
~ I can change this.
~ No.

22:28.180 --> 22:31.050
There are some things we must accept.

22:35.180 --> 22:36.690
This is not one of them.

22:36.740 --> 22:38.740
Where are you going?

22:40.100 --> 22:41.970
All will be well.

22:43.420 --> 22:45.820
~ I promise.
~ Icarus!

22:55.740 --> 22:59.450
This had better be good. I am not
interested in a tale of a tavern brawl.

22:59.500 --> 23:01.650
My father is due to
be executed tomorrow.

23:01.700 --> 23:03.370
You disturbed me to tell me this?

23:03.420 --> 23:05.370
I beg you to rethink.

23:05.420 --> 23:07.160
Take him away!

23:08.420 --> 23:11.170
~ No, you don't understand.
~ I am not interested in your pleas.

23:11.220 --> 23:12.570
I have news.

23:12.620 --> 23:14.220
Of Ariadne.

23:15.220 --> 23:16.940
What news?

23:20.060 --> 23:22.460
You will not hang my father?

23:24.420 --> 23:26.820
I will not hang your father.

23:27.780 --> 23:30.650
~ She hides in the woods.
~ This I know.

23:31.700 --> 23:34.610
Her followers are headed towards
the silver mines at Pangeon...

23:34.660 --> 23:36.600
with some urgency.

23:37.220 --> 23:39.570
What do they hope to find there?

23:39.620 --> 23:41.360
I do not know.

23:44.380 --> 23:46.320
You have done well.

23:48.420 --> 23:50.890
~ You will free my father.
~ No.

23:52.060 --> 23:55.290
I will not hang your father.
I said nothing of freeing him.

23:55.340 --> 23:57.610
Why would I do that...

23:57.660 --> 24:00.860
when you bring me such
useful information?

24:53.980 --> 24:55.410
Aeson?

24:55.460 --> 24:57.460
Aeson?

24:59.420 --> 25:01.960
Aeson, I need to speak to you.

25:08.940 --> 25:11.010
I have news of Jason.

25:15.500 --> 25:20.100
~ Who are you?
~ It's Pythagoras.

25:21.660 --> 25:23.410
I need your help.

25:23.460 --> 25:24.810
Aeson...

25:24.860 --> 25:27.400
I trust this news pleases you.

25:29.140 --> 25:32.850
Send men to the Valley of Iria.
Pythagoras must return that way.

25:32.900 --> 25:36.740
Follow him. He will certainly
lead us to Jason.

25:40.500 --> 25:42.570
~ What is it?
~ Nothing.

25:43.420 --> 25:45.160
We draw closer.

25:46.260 --> 25:49.260
~ Indeed.
~ He is finally within our sights.

25:50.340 --> 25:51.880
I'm a fool.

25:53.460 --> 25:55.170
That woman makes me a fool.

25:55.220 --> 25:57.530
Even after all that she has
done I trusted her with this.

25:57.580 --> 25:58.930
I trusted she would not tell him.

25:58.980 --> 26:01.050
It was to her advantage.

26:01.100 --> 26:03.970
~ How so?
~ Jason was about to kill her.

26:05.700 --> 26:09.000
If only he had, for now
he is lost to all of us.

26:11.340 --> 26:13.700
His heart has blackened.

26:16.300 --> 26:19.460
Where once there was compassion,
now there is just anger.

26:21.180 --> 26:23.090
Anger and hatred.

26:23.140 --> 26:26.530
Those who are touched by the gods
carry the darkness within them.

26:26.580 --> 26:28.520
We need your help.

26:29.180 --> 26:31.610
I thank you for your belief in
me but I fear it is misplaced.

26:31.660 --> 26:34.970
~ I cannot do what you ask.
~ You're the only one who can save him.

26:36.140 --> 26:39.130
All this endless fighting
leaves me weary.

26:39.180 --> 26:41.570
Power passes from hand to
hand, but nothing changes.

26:41.620 --> 26:44.700
I fear that without you, Jason
cannot resist Pasiphae.

26:48.140 --> 26:50.930
We must believe that
good will triumph.

26:50.980 --> 26:53.010
Were he himself, that might be true.

26:53.060 --> 26:56.570
Look at the life he has lived, all
that he has accomplished without me.

26:56.620 --> 27:01.940
Jason believes his father to be dead.
I am dead to him. That is the best way.

27:03.180 --> 27:04.370
How can that be so?

27:04.420 --> 27:08.330
In another life Jason had a father...

27:08.380 --> 27:11.010
a father who protected him,
who he could be proud of.

27:11.060 --> 27:12.600
Look at me!

27:14.460 --> 27:16.400
I am not that man.

27:19.380 --> 27:21.380
Would that I were...

27:22.020 --> 27:24.960
Would that I could
have my life again.

27:27.460 --> 27:30.690
It is anticipated that the boy
will lead us to Ariadne and Jason.

27:30.740 --> 27:35.220
As soon as you have Pythagoras in sight,
dispatch a messenger without delay.

27:42.780 --> 27:44.930
It's a shame Pythagoras
is missing this!

27:44.980 --> 27:49.100
It was a fool's mission.
He's probably dead.

27:53.300 --> 27:56.400
You can give him my share,
should he return.

28:00.740 --> 28:05.530
Pythagoras is not dead.
I would know if he were.

28:05.580 --> 28:06.980
In here.

28:13.500 --> 28:16.240
How long have you two been friends?

28:17.500 --> 28:21.260
Long enough to forget how long,
and believe it to be for ever.

28:28.580 --> 28:30.650
What Jason did to you...

28:30.700 --> 28:33.170
he did it for me, to save me.

28:34.300 --> 28:37.300
He thought he was doing
the right thing.

28:39.020 --> 28:42.220
Jason always thinks he's
doing the right thing.

28:44.420 --> 28:46.770
And Medusa, she... she knew...

28:46.820 --> 28:49.980
Oh, yeah... she knew.

28:52.140 --> 28:54.540
She knew what she was doing.

28:56.060 --> 28:59.060
And believe me, I'm just
as angry with her.

29:00.020 --> 29:02.560
Don't let her death be in vain.

29:03.500 --> 29:06.800
Don't let it destroy those
who are still living.

29:08.380 --> 29:09.980
Talk to him.

29:13.700 --> 29:16.370
Maybe you can find a way through.

29:26.380 --> 29:28.250
What will you do?

29:29.140 --> 29:30.450
I don't know.

29:30.500 --> 29:32.700
Return to my friends.

29:34.460 --> 29:37.960
~ I'll do what I can.
~ And I have not done what I can?

29:38.820 --> 29:40.960
Well, no, you haven't.

29:41.740 --> 29:45.650
You are the one person who
can help. Jason needs you.

29:45.700 --> 29:49.610
For the first time ever, he
really needs you, and you...

29:49.660 --> 29:52.650
~ You are deserting him.
~ I am not deserting him.

29:52.700 --> 29:56.610
The Jason I first met, the Jason I
have journeyed with these past years,

29:56.660 --> 29:59.930
is a person I admire
with all my heart.

29:59.980 --> 30:02.920
The kind of person
I would like to be.

30:04.820 --> 30:06.420
He is brave.

30:07.060 --> 30:08.660
He is loyal.

30:10.340 --> 30:12.480
He is nothing like you.

30:48.140 --> 30:49.970
Do not look so afraid.

30:50.020 --> 30:51.960
I mean you no harm.

31:25.460 --> 31:27.600
There's no more to say.

31:29.500 --> 31:32.440
In that case, we will
walk in silence.

31:53.860 --> 31:56.460
I do not wish to fight with you.

31:58.260 --> 32:01.260
Whatever has happened, we should
not be turning knives on each other.

32:03.660 --> 32:05.800
I cannot deny my anger.

32:06.540 --> 32:08.300
Then don't.

32:09.700 --> 32:12.800
But it was wrong of me
to take it out on you.

32:14.220 --> 32:15.890
I understand.

32:17.020 --> 32:18.620
After all...

32:20.420 --> 32:22.220
.. I killed her.

32:26.140 --> 32:28.450
S-She agreed to it?

32:28.500 --> 32:29.700
Mmm.

32:30.660 --> 32:32.620
She agreed.

32:34.020 --> 32:36.160
There was no struggle.

32:38.660 --> 32:41.760
Was there not another
way? Any other way?

32:44.500 --> 32:46.100
I loved her.

32:49.820 --> 32:52.780
And I'm sure... that she loved you.

32:54.220 --> 32:56.220
But she's gone now.

32:59.700 --> 33:01.440
Life moves on.

33:13.740 --> 33:16.780
~ Where are they camped?
~ The far side of the valley.

33:17.980 --> 33:20.520
We will be there by nightfall.

33:30.980 --> 33:32.530
'You have found Pythagoras?'

33:32.580 --> 33:34.410
As you predicted, he is not alone.

33:34.460 --> 33:37.460
I will ride with you.
Saddle the horses.

34:00.260 --> 34:01.490
What are you doing?

34:01.540 --> 34:04.290
I cannot remain. I'm sorry.

34:04.340 --> 34:08.050
~ I tried, but I cannot be with him.
~ We have to stay together.

34:08.100 --> 34:10.300
You are welcome to come.

34:10.580 --> 34:13.050
The forest is swarming with soldiers.

34:13.100 --> 34:16.290
If I stay, nothing will end well.

34:16.340 --> 34:18.170
I cannot look after him alone.

34:18.219 --> 34:20.360
Pythagoras will return.

34:21.139 --> 34:22.370
Hercules, please.

34:22.420 --> 34:23.730
I cannot.

34:23.780 --> 34:27.010
In my head, I know he is not himself,

34:27.060 --> 34:30.850
but I don't have the strength to stop my
gut, and my gut just wants to kill him.

34:30.900 --> 34:33.620
I'm sorry it has come to this.

34:48.260 --> 34:51.000
We move camp every couple of days.

34:53.580 --> 34:56.780
This is Hercules's way of telling
me exactly where they're headed.

35:02.060 --> 35:05.250
Do not worry. I know where they are.

35:05.300 --> 35:07.450
I do not doubt your skill.

35:07.500 --> 35:10.100
I am more concerned with my own.

35:11.540 --> 35:14.780
What am I going to say to him? What
if he doesn't want to know me at all?

35:41.500 --> 35:43.040
He's back.

35:45.500 --> 35:47.440
Pythagoras is back.

35:48.620 --> 35:50.690
Who's that he's with?

37:17.820 --> 37:21.120
Eith' Hekate doie menos
ifthimon ede moi alken.

37:41.940 --> 37:43.780
Shh.

37:45.740 --> 37:47.480
Where's Jason?

37:50.140 --> 37:53.090
Jason was badly injured. There
is no way that he could survive.

37:53.140 --> 37:56.890
We will find him. I will
bring you his body.

37:56.940 --> 37:59.650
Victory is within sight, my Lady.

37:59.700 --> 38:02.620
Gaia thea, phainu - dunamin gar emoi.

38:05.900 --> 38:07.300
Victory?

38:13.180 --> 38:15.250
Do not speak to me...

38:16.140 --> 38:17.880
.. of victory.

38:43.700 --> 38:47.490
Tende thean kaleus hemon
empsukhon hapanton.

38:59.380 --> 39:01.120
What happened?

39:01.810 --> 39:02.810
Shh.

39:02.860 --> 39:04.600
You must rest.

39:05.740 --> 39:08.280
Sleep can help you more than I.

39:11.460 --> 39:14.460
Should I be sleeping
with one eye open?

39:22.420 --> 39:23.760
Look...

39:24.900 --> 39:27.640
There's someone moving over there.

39:28.180 --> 39:29.720
Pythagoras!

39:31.660 --> 39:33.200
Pythagoras!

39:41.900 --> 39:44.410
~ It's so good to see you.
~ I thought you were dead.

39:44.460 --> 39:46.340
Where's Jason?

39:47.460 --> 39:48.970
Who is this?

39:49.020 --> 39:53.290
~ You need not be afraid.
~ You brought Pasiphae here.
~ No.

39:53.340 --> 39:56.490
No, I promise you, my hatred for Pasiphae
runs deeper even than yours.

39:56.540 --> 39:58.610
I find that hard to believe.

39:58.660 --> 40:00.250
It is true.

40:00.300 --> 40:02.380
He is Jason's father.

40:32.180 --> 40:34.180
How are you feeling?

40:44.260 --> 40:45.900
Better.

40:47.260 --> 40:49.400
Much better, thank you.

40:53.260 --> 40:55.400
Why are you helping me?

40:56.140 --> 40:59.140
We are all drawn together, those
of us who are touched by the gods.

41:00.140 --> 41:02.810
That's why I can sense
you in my dreams?

41:02.860 --> 41:05.490
We are more alike than you know.

41:09.020 --> 41:10.610
We should not linger here.

41:10.660 --> 41:13.290
Then where do you suggest we go?

41:13.340 --> 41:15.280
Back to my mother?

41:15.940 --> 41:17.880
She wants you dead.

41:20.580 --> 41:22.320
What about you?

41:24.740 --> 41:26.100
How...

41:27.540 --> 41:30.640
How do I know that you
won't just turn me in?

41:33.820 --> 41:35.360
You do not.

41:56.460 --> 41:59.200
In his hour of need I deserted him.

41:59.810 --> 42:00.810
I failed Medusa

42:00.860 --> 42:02.330
and now I've failed Jason.

42:02.380 --> 42:05.010
As long as there is a chance that
Jason is still alive, we must do

42:05.060 --> 42:07.860
everything in our power to save him.

42:14.700 --> 42:16.100
Jason...

42:16.820 --> 42:17.860
Guards!
