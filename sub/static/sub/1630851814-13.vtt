00:50.925 --> 00:53.553
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION
BASED IN A DYSTOPIAN KOREA

00:53.636 --> 00:56.306
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS ARE FICTITIOUS

00:56.389 --> 00:57.640
Judge Kang, please.

00:58.516 --> 01:01.019
Please don't come here, Judge Kang.

01:02.020 --> 01:05.148
Judge Kang, please don't come here…

01:06.149 --> 01:08.109
Please don't come here, Judge Kang.
Please…

01:17.494 --> 01:19.746
Judge Kang, please don't come here…

01:21.831 --> 01:23.917
Don't come here, Judge Kang.

01:24.626 --> 01:25.919
No! It's dangerous.

01:28.087 --> 01:29.714
Don't come here!

01:43.728 --> 01:44.979
Put that down.

01:48.066 --> 01:49.484
You know,

01:50.944 --> 01:53.530
I wish you were lonely like me,

01:54.447 --> 01:55.323
Young Master.

01:56.407 --> 01:59.077
Perhaps then you'll stay by my side

01:59.661 --> 02:02.205
when you have no one left.

02:04.916 --> 02:05.834
Professor!

03:00.138 --> 03:01.097
Professor…

03:03.349 --> 03:04.434
Help us!

03:04.517 --> 03:06.519
Mister, not him! Mister!

03:19.532 --> 03:20.783
Damn it.

03:29.292 --> 03:32.587
-Min-su!
-Are you all right?

03:32.670 --> 03:33.922
Get out.

03:34.005 --> 03:35.173
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

03:35.256 --> 03:36.966
Thank you.

03:37.050 --> 03:38.927
-This way.
-Thank you.

03:40.178 --> 03:41.179
Ga-on!

03:42.680 --> 03:44.182
It's been a long time.

03:44.766 --> 03:47.101
It's me. Don't you remember me?

03:51.981 --> 03:53.274
Long time no see, you jerk.

03:57.862 --> 03:58.905
Get him!

04:08.164 --> 04:09.374
I will…

04:12.794 --> 04:14.045
make sure you die

04:15.588 --> 04:17.423
in the most lonely, pathetic way.

04:20.468 --> 04:22.470
A death that suits you.

04:44.534 --> 04:45.785
Does it hurt a lot?

04:49.664 --> 04:51.082
That's too bad.

04:58.172 --> 05:01.467
You'll need to go save
Judge Kim Ga-on too.

05:05.513 --> 05:07.890
<i>Try the Hyeongsan-dong slums.</i>

05:12.353 --> 05:13.604
I told you, didn't I?

05:14.230 --> 05:17.692
That I wish you were lonely to death.

07:13.099 --> 07:15.893
Inspector Yoon Su-hyeon.
It's me, Kang Yo-han.

07:15.977 --> 07:17.186
What's your business?

07:17.270 --> 07:18.604
<i>Ga-on is in danger.</i>

07:18.688 --> 07:20.690
<i>-Find him.</i>
-What?

07:20.773 --> 07:23.192
At the Hyeongsan-dong slums. Now.

08:04.734 --> 08:06.944
Your life is just as pitiful…

08:07.945 --> 08:09.530
as mine.

08:14.410 --> 08:16.078
We were almost there.

08:18.539 --> 08:20.374
Now you just needed to live your life.

09:13.594 --> 09:15.805
<i>Your call cannot be
connected at this time.</i>

09:19.058 --> 09:21.018
Elijah's not picking up.

09:23.479 --> 09:24.814
Elijah…

10:26.959 --> 10:28.169
Ga-on!

11:27.561 --> 11:28.562
Excuse me.

11:36.529 --> 11:41.742
OH MY JUDGE

11:55.965 --> 11:57.675
EMERGENCY PREVENTIVE MEASURES
DESTINATION: DREAM BASE VILLAGE

12:07.143 --> 12:08.185
Su-hyeon…

12:08.269 --> 12:10.062
It's okay as long as you're not hurt.

12:11.397 --> 12:13.107
What were you doing there anyway?

12:13.816 --> 12:16.444
Well, I receive a strange call.

12:16.527 --> 12:19.697
And instructed me to go there
if I wanted to save Professor Min.

12:19.780 --> 12:20.865
What are you on about?

12:20.948 --> 12:23.159
I just spoke to Professor Min
this morning.

12:24.452 --> 12:26.162
He's recovering well at the hospital.

12:26.829 --> 12:27.997
Is he?

12:30.040 --> 12:33.544
Then that Jukchang bastard
lied to lure me out.

12:38.549 --> 12:40.843
Anyway, how did you know where I was?

12:40.926 --> 12:42.261
Well, I just…

12:44.305 --> 12:46.015
heard it on the police radio.

12:49.018 --> 12:51.228
<i>My fellow Koreans, the deadly virus</i>

12:51.312 --> 12:54.231
<i>was once again discovered
in the slums of Hyeongsan-dong.</i>

12:54.315 --> 12:56.484
<i>We can overcome this once again.</i>

12:56.567 --> 12:59.361
<i>No matter what crisis we face,</i>

12:59.445 --> 13:00.946
<i>we will prevail.</i>

13:03.824 --> 13:04.909
Judge Kang.

13:06.577 --> 13:08.078
Judge Kang, get up.

13:10.873 --> 13:13.918
Judge Kang, you must get up.

13:17.588 --> 13:18.797
Judge Kang.

13:21.884 --> 13:23.302
Judge Kang, get up.

13:25.179 --> 13:26.388
Judge Kang.

13:31.352 --> 13:32.853
Judge Kang, you must get up.

13:33.729 --> 13:34.980
Judge Kang!

13:35.064 --> 13:36.190
Judge Kang.

13:53.707 --> 13:54.792
How are you feeling?

13:57.461 --> 14:00.130
We stopped your bleeding for now.

14:00.214 --> 14:01.423
Are you all right?

14:02.258 --> 14:04.885
We are being attacked.

14:05.636 --> 14:07.346
I was worried about you too,

14:07.429 --> 14:09.598
so I tracked your location
and found you here.

14:13.227 --> 14:16.230
But we can't get a hold of
Ms. Han So-yoon.

14:20.109 --> 14:21.861
You two, find Ms. Han So-yoon.

14:48.095 --> 14:49.388
Hello?

14:49.471 --> 14:51.807
Why wouldn't you pick up?

14:52.474 --> 14:54.977
Geez, you scared me.

14:55.060 --> 14:58.022
<i>Why are you yelling at me? I was sleeping.</i>

14:58.105 --> 14:59.315
Listen to me carefully.

14:59.982 --> 15:02.443
No matter who comes to visit,
don't ever open the door.

15:02.526 --> 15:04.778
<i>Stay in your room at all times, all right?</i>

15:07.156 --> 15:08.324
All right.

15:08.991 --> 15:11.744
<i>Hyeongsan-dong,
where the new variant was discovered,</i>

15:11.827 --> 15:13.746
<i>is a slum community.</i>

15:13.829 --> 15:15.497
<i>The Government and the SRF</i>

15:15.581 --> 15:18.792
<i>are now safely relocating
its residents to the Dream Base…</i>

15:30.179 --> 15:31.263
Elijah.

15:34.183 --> 15:36.352
How did you know this is my favorite?

15:37.895 --> 15:39.313
It's delicious.

15:41.565 --> 15:43.192
Where did you get it?

15:46.153 --> 15:48.197
You and I have similar tastes.

15:51.200 --> 15:52.534
Well, it's delicious.

16:05.798 --> 16:06.715
You're home.

16:14.932 --> 16:16.684
You're late, Judge Kang.

16:18.060 --> 16:20.938
There were a group of suspicious men
outside, apparently.

16:21.897 --> 16:24.400
Thank goodness the Chairwoman dropped by.

16:25.943 --> 16:27.653
She told me you'd asked her to.

16:32.783 --> 16:33.826
Yes, I did.

16:35.244 --> 16:36.996
Thank you.

16:37.079 --> 16:38.956
You're welcome.

16:49.341 --> 16:51.135
Let me do that for you.

17:06.984 --> 17:09.987
I wish you were lonely like me,

17:10.070 --> 17:11.113
Young Master.

17:18.162 --> 17:19.455
Here you go.

17:33.761 --> 17:35.220
Thank you.

17:39.183 --> 17:40.434
Elijah.

17:40.517 --> 17:42.519
You go to your room.

17:42.603 --> 17:44.605
I need to have a chat with the Chairwoman.

17:44.688 --> 17:46.106
Oh no.

17:47.441 --> 17:49.735
Not when we just started to
get to know each other.

17:49.818 --> 17:51.236
Right?

17:55.908 --> 17:57.117
She's quite interesting.

17:57.826 --> 18:01.497
I think she and I click
because we're similar.

18:07.044 --> 18:08.003
Right?

18:08.670 --> 18:10.089
Aren't we similar?

18:10.923 --> 18:14.301
We're both smart, ruthless,

18:16.512 --> 18:18.680
and a little broken.

18:24.895 --> 18:27.189
This is only the beginning, Young Master.

18:32.194 --> 18:33.946
Still, let's not cross the line.

18:35.072 --> 18:37.699
Goodness, look at me.

18:37.783 --> 18:40.244
Maybe I was being too friendly.

18:41.370 --> 18:43.872
I do apologize, Miss Elijah.

18:45.499 --> 18:46.750
Goodbye, then.

18:58.387 --> 19:00.973
What's with that woman? She's weird.

19:02.850 --> 19:04.810
By the way,
why are you sweating like that?

19:06.061 --> 19:07.479
Did something happen?

19:09.648 --> 19:10.983
Nothing.

19:14.570 --> 19:15.904
What is this?

19:16.572 --> 19:17.698
Isn't this blood?

19:18.699 --> 19:19.950
It's all right.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.663
It's all right now, Elijah.

19:31.628 --> 19:32.880
It's all right.

19:44.057 --> 19:45.392
It's all right.

19:50.856 --> 19:52.107
You said you're not hurt.

20:04.578 --> 20:07.414
I'm sorry, Su-hyeon.

20:13.378 --> 20:14.671
About what?

20:16.715 --> 20:18.717
For making you see me like that

20:21.970 --> 20:23.222
when Cha Gyeong-hui died.

20:27.893 --> 20:29.603
No need to apologize.

20:31.396 --> 20:33.690
I'm not that much of
a respectable cop, anyway.

20:37.110 --> 20:40.197
I know Kang Yo-han's ways aren't right,

20:41.573 --> 20:44.409
and that it's a crime
for a judge to do such things.

20:45.911 --> 20:47.246
But I just can't bear it.

20:50.874 --> 20:53.418
I think I'll lose my mind
if I don't do this at least.

20:54.336 --> 20:57.214
I know I have no right to be with you,

20:58.215 --> 21:01.843
and I've always been so pathetic
in front of you too.

21:01.927 --> 21:04.346
And I know I'm shameless

21:05.305 --> 21:07.266
when I say I can't live without you.

21:09.017 --> 21:11.103
But I just can't go on without you.

21:12.938 --> 21:14.773
You're such an idiot.

21:17.693 --> 21:19.111
I can't bear it any longer.

21:19.611 --> 21:22.447
How long must I put up
with your stupid talk?

21:23.532 --> 21:25.951
-Su-hyeon.
-Do you still not get it?

21:26.034 --> 21:27.953
Who cares about rights?

21:28.036 --> 21:31.331
I have no idea what's right or wrong
or what this world is coming to,

21:31.415 --> 21:32.624
but please.

21:35.544 --> 21:38.046
Please don't get yourself
into danger like this.

21:41.758 --> 21:42.884
Don't cry,

21:44.219 --> 21:48.181
don't bring misfortune upon yourself,
and don't ruin your life like this.

21:49.641 --> 21:51.810
That's all I ask for, Ga-on.

21:54.021 --> 21:55.939
As long as I have you,

21:57.107 --> 21:58.025
Ga-on.

22:51.703 --> 22:53.121
I should get going.

22:53.205 --> 22:55.749
I need to check how things are going.
And you stay here like a good boy

22:55.832 --> 22:58.376
because who knows
when you'll be attacked next? I'm off.

22:59.586 --> 23:01.088
Su-hyeon…

23:04.716 --> 23:07.010
-Bye.
-Yes, bye…

23:30.492 --> 23:34.287
Jukchang was his name, was it?
He's very good at what he's doing.

23:34.371 --> 23:36.039
Yes, he's bold and daring.

23:36.123 --> 23:38.500
He's really quick at getting things done.

23:38.583 --> 23:41.670
I told you. Those with nothing to lose
always do a good job.

23:42.671 --> 23:45.298
Chairwoman Jung, what about
Judge Kang Yo-han's supporters?

23:46.258 --> 23:47.551
Did you take care of them?

23:47.634 --> 23:50.929
Yes, I got almost all of them
on the emergency bus.

23:51.680 --> 23:53.598
Since it's the people who matter the most.

23:55.851 --> 23:58.311
So you know that
it's the people who matter the most.

24:00.272 --> 24:01.481
Yes?

24:07.487 --> 24:10.157
You're done with
the emergency announcement, are you?

24:10.240 --> 24:11.491
Thank you for your work.

24:12.701 --> 24:14.119
Judge Oh

24:14.202 --> 24:19.082
has reassured our citizens
by instilling confidence.

24:19.166 --> 24:20.667
Let's give her a big hand!

24:27.966 --> 24:30.177
So how serious is the situation?

24:30.760 --> 24:32.637
I was told it's a highly fatal variant.

24:33.680 --> 24:36.057
This is a residential area too,
so I'm worried…

24:36.141 --> 24:38.226
Don't you worry about that.

24:38.977 --> 24:42.898
We're currently enforcing
emergency measures nationwide.

24:44.149 --> 24:45.775
Then instead of just broadcasting,

24:45.859 --> 24:48.195
I should be out there
helping the relief work--

24:50.614 --> 24:51.990
We should…

24:52.949 --> 24:55.035
leave that to the experts. Right?

24:55.118 --> 24:56.620
Of course.

25:01.374 --> 25:02.876
I see. All right.

25:03.710 --> 25:05.378
Then I'll be leaving now.

25:08.548 --> 25:11.885
Judge Oh, just get ready for it.

25:14.221 --> 25:15.055
Pardon?

25:16.973 --> 25:19.059
For inauguration as the presiding judge.

25:26.733 --> 25:28.610
Let's have a drink to celebrate later.

25:37.202 --> 25:39.537
<i>Due to the emergence
of the Hyeongsan-dong variant,</i>

25:39.621 --> 25:43.541
<i>the Dream Base migration project
has been progressing faster than expected.</i>

25:43.625 --> 25:46.753
<i>The Social Responsibility Foundation…</i>

25:46.836 --> 25:49.506
Get some rest and don't overwork yourself.

25:49.589 --> 25:51.383
-Then I'll leave you to it.
-Thank you.

25:51.466 --> 25:54.427
<i>…will also fund the R&D for a cure.</i>

25:54.511 --> 25:57.264
<i>If you wish to make a donation,</i>

25:57.347 --> 25:59.724
<i>please visit the SRF's official website</i>

25:59.808 --> 26:02.435
<i>for more information.</i>

26:02.519 --> 26:03.979
<i>We welcome your participation.</i>

26:06.398 --> 26:07.524
Are you all right?

26:07.607 --> 26:09.818
Where did you hurt yourself like that?

26:10.777 --> 26:11.903
It's nothing.

26:13.363 --> 26:14.406
Really?

26:14.489 --> 26:15.532
Yes.

26:17.200 --> 26:18.326
Don't worry.

26:18.910 --> 26:20.036
I'll stay healthy.

26:21.162 --> 26:24.791
Until you can stand up
on your own two feet and kill me.

26:26.126 --> 26:27.794
Seriously?

26:27.877 --> 26:29.504
What are you talking about?

26:29.587 --> 26:32.007
-You think I'll ever worry for you?
<i>-Up next,</i>

26:32.090 --> 26:36.094
<i>President Heo Joong-se
will be addressing the nation.</i>

26:36.177 --> 26:39.597
<i>His statement will concern
the Government's position</i>

26:39.681 --> 26:41.182
<i>on the Hyeongsan-dong variant,</i>

26:41.266 --> 26:44.269
<i>so may we ask for
your full attention, please.</i>

26:50.400 --> 26:51.943
<i>-Hello.</i>
-Mr. Go.

26:52.027 --> 26:55.280
Judge Kang, how are you feeling?
Are you all right?

26:55.363 --> 26:58.783
Yes, I'm fine.
Did you manage to find Ms. Han So-yoon?

26:58.867 --> 27:00.493
<i>What about the other supporters?</i>

27:01.244 --> 27:03.121
I think they were taken by the SRF guys.

27:03.204 --> 27:06.708
<i>They're dragging people away,
using emergency relief as an excuse.</i>

27:06.791 --> 27:09.919
<i>This is a state of emergency
with lives at stake.</i>

27:10.628 --> 27:14.132
<i>From now on,
all media including newspapers</i>

27:14.215 --> 27:16.134
<i>will be under state control.</i>

27:16.217 --> 27:20.597
<i>A 10 p.m. curfew will also be enforced.</i>

27:24.267 --> 27:26.019
<i>This morning, our government arrested</i>

27:26.686 --> 27:29.814
<i>the ring of malcontents
who have been spreading</i>

27:29.898 --> 27:32.817
<i>false propaganda to breed social unrest,</i>

27:32.901 --> 27:35.195
<i>and is now investigating their background.</i>

27:48.917 --> 27:51.252
<i>-We can't get a hold of Ms. Han So-yoon.
-Did you manage to find her?</i>

27:51.336 --> 27:53.380
<i>I think they were taken by the SRF guys.</i>

27:56.716 --> 27:58.927
<i>Despite that tragedy
you suffered ten years ago…</i>

27:59.010 --> 28:01.721
<i>Yes, every time I see Judge Kang,
my eyes tear up.</i>

28:06.476 --> 28:08.186
<i>Judge Kang!</i>

28:08.978 --> 28:11.022
Are they telling me to just bear it

28:11.106 --> 28:12.941
because my future isn't so bright?

28:13.024 --> 28:15.193
<i>Yi-sak…</i>

28:16.736 --> 28:17.862
<i>So this is your way, is it?</i>

28:17.946 --> 28:19.781
<i>How will you confront those
who move this world</i>

28:19.864 --> 28:22.117
<i>if you'll push out even those
who are beside you?</i>

28:22.200 --> 28:23.868
<i>That's my way of doing things.</i>

28:23.952 --> 28:25.245
<i>And that will never change.</i>

28:25.328 --> 28:27.705
<i>You know what kind of bastards
we're up against.</i>

28:27.789 --> 28:29.833
<i>And they're probably now
in high spirits too.</i>

28:29.916 --> 28:31.418
<i>Who knows what they will do next?</i>

28:38.341 --> 28:40.760
<i>I never deluded myself
into thinking that I'm justice.</i>

28:40.844 --> 28:43.638
<i>I'd been merely making decisions.</i>

28:45.515 --> 28:47.851
<i>Judge Kang Yo-han</i>

28:47.934 --> 28:50.645
<i>is driving this country toward
violent madness.</i>

28:53.732 --> 28:58.111
<i>All actions against emergency quarantine
and relief measures</i>

28:58.194 --> 29:01.406
<i>will be considered murder,
and will be punished</i>

29:01.489 --> 29:04.409
<i>by the maximum penalty allowable by law.</i>

29:05.785 --> 29:08.371
<i>What if they end up pointing
that sword at you?</i>

29:08.955 --> 29:10.582
<i>Turning crises into opportunities</i>

29:10.665 --> 29:12.167
<i>is how those who move the world operate.</i>

29:12.250 --> 29:14.794
<i>And I just couldn't stand their hypocrisy.</i>

29:14.878 --> 29:16.004
<i>It was revolting.</i>

29:18.339 --> 29:19.966
<i>Monster, did you say?</i>

29:20.049 --> 29:23.011
<i>You have no courage to accept your pain.</i>

29:24.137 --> 29:26.222
<i>You think this battle is a joke, do you?</i>

29:27.390 --> 29:28.975
<i>You need to stop.</i>

29:29.058 --> 29:30.977
<i>You are ruining this world.</i>

29:31.978 --> 29:34.522
<i>Fellow Koreans, do not be afraid.</i>

29:35.231 --> 29:38.026
<i>We will prevail!</i>

29:38.818 --> 29:42.530
<i>We will overcome this crisis</i>

29:43.114 --> 29:48.119
<i>and prove to the rest of the world</i>

29:48.203 --> 29:50.997
<i>that we are the most outstanding nation.</i>

29:51.080 --> 29:55.627
<i>So please believe in me
and our government!</i>

29:57.045 --> 29:58.213
<i>Yo-han,</i>

29:58.296 --> 29:59.547
<i>promise me one thing.</i>

29:59.631 --> 30:02.091
<i>Just promise me one thing.</i>

30:02.175 --> 30:04.302
<i>That you won't harm the innocent.</i>

30:04.385 --> 30:06.179
<i>That you won't harm the innocent.</i>

30:15.063 --> 30:16.147
<i>I'm sorry, Yi-sak.</i>

30:19.317 --> 30:20.610
<i>I don't think</i>

30:21.402 --> 30:22.821
<i>I can keep that promise.</i>

30:24.155 --> 30:26.908
<i>The SRF, with tremendous responsibilities</i>

30:26.991 --> 30:30.578
<i>to stop the spread of the variant
to other parts of Seoul</i>

30:30.662 --> 30:33.832
<i>is carrying out emergency rescue
and relief aid by migrating</i>

30:33.915 --> 30:36.543
<i>the residents of Hyeongsan-dong
to the Dream Base village.</i>

30:37.126 --> 30:40.797
<i>The SRF, who is working
closely with the government…</i>

30:41.422 --> 30:42.298
Judge Kim.

30:44.425 --> 30:46.219
Those are all downright lies.

30:46.803 --> 30:49.472
Do you know
what's really happening out there?

30:49.556 --> 30:51.474
What's this about all of a sudden?

30:51.558 --> 30:53.685
It's all chaos
because of the virus variant.

30:53.768 --> 30:56.521
They are dragging people away
like they are animals.

30:56.604 --> 30:57.772
That news?

30:57.856 --> 30:59.023
It's all fake.

30:59.107 --> 31:01.317
-The Foundation manipulated it.
-How can that be?

31:01.401 --> 31:04.195
I saw it and experienced it
for myself at the scene.

31:04.279 --> 31:05.613
It's Jukchang and his army's doing.

31:05.697 --> 31:08.783
They are beating innocent people
with steel pipes.

31:11.077 --> 31:12.745
You were a victim?

31:12.829 --> 31:14.747
Do you know what scares me even more?

31:14.831 --> 31:16.541
No matter how hard I think about it,

31:16.624 --> 31:19.627
I arrive at the conclusion
that the discovery of the variant itself

31:19.711 --> 31:20.795
is a lie.

31:20.879 --> 31:22.171
Hold on.

31:23.172 --> 31:25.758
Are you sure you're in your right mind?

31:25.842 --> 31:28.845
By raising the wind over
this "highly fatal variant,"

31:28.928 --> 31:32.724
they deployed Jukchang to the frontline,
who is no more than a hooligan.

31:32.807 --> 31:36.102
Without any PPE,
and hardly wearing a mask too.

31:36.185 --> 31:38.730
Think about it.
Jukchang was the ringleader

31:38.813 --> 31:40.815
of Heo Joong-se's private organization.

31:40.899 --> 31:42.859
Now, he's a criminal
with an electronic tag,

31:42.942 --> 31:45.862
and he's at the forefront
of a national emergency operation.

31:46.571 --> 31:47.739
Judge Oh.

31:49.073 --> 31:50.825
You're being used.

31:53.411 --> 31:55.330
Your videos are everywhere
on the streets--

31:55.413 --> 31:56.331
I'm sorry,

31:57.457 --> 31:59.417
but I think you've been highly wrought up.

31:59.500 --> 32:02.503
I don't know what excessive force
was used at the scene,

32:02.587 --> 32:04.964
but are you telling me to
actually believe all that?

32:05.506 --> 32:07.842
Don't you think you've gone too far?

32:07.926 --> 32:09.802
-Judge Oh.
-At a time like this,

32:09.886 --> 32:12.430
we need to stay calm and restore order.

32:12.513 --> 32:14.891
And I'm only assisting that.

32:31.824 --> 32:33.534
You're not at the court.

32:33.618 --> 32:36.079
-Is something going on?
<i>-I heard you were hurt.</i>

32:37.413 --> 32:38.665
I'm fine.

32:38.748 --> 32:42.001
Before that, do you know
what's happening right now?

32:43.461 --> 32:44.671
As long as you're fine.

32:45.380 --> 32:46.714
We'll discuss that later.

32:47.423 --> 32:49.133
Hello?

32:58.726 --> 32:59.894
Come in.

33:03.272 --> 33:05.858
Have a seat, Judge Kang.

33:08.778 --> 33:13.116
I don't have bad proportions,
but this outfit just doesn't flatter me.

33:13.199 --> 33:14.242
It's just so drab.

33:15.159 --> 33:18.371
This is where improvements
should come first.

33:19.414 --> 33:21.666
What did you do to the country?

33:24.168 --> 33:25.420
What do you mean?

33:25.503 --> 33:28.756
I'm protecting our country
and our people from the pandemic.

33:28.840 --> 33:32.385
Forcing out the poor from their houses
by rounding up your private army, is it?

33:33.594 --> 33:35.138
Is that what you're talking about?

33:36.222 --> 33:37.640
But what am I supposed to do?

33:37.724 --> 33:40.435
Should I leave all of our
ten million Seoul citizens to die,

33:40.518 --> 33:43.271
to uphold the rights of some 10,000?

33:44.063 --> 33:46.399
Isn't 1,000 a bigger number than one?

33:46.482 --> 33:48.735
Can't you do the math
when you even passed the bar exam?

33:49.736 --> 33:53.656
Besides, people will be happier
once this crisis subsides.

33:53.740 --> 33:55.908
Why? Because now that Seoul's cleaner,

33:55.992 --> 33:57.869
their housing prices will go up.

33:57.952 --> 33:59.787
That's what humans are.

34:02.206 --> 34:03.416
Are you sure

34:03.958 --> 34:06.169
the virus has re-emerged?

34:13.843 --> 34:16.637
Wow, I didn't know you were such a psycho.

34:18.306 --> 34:21.184
Hey. How could you make such a joke

34:21.267 --> 34:24.353
when we're discussing
state emergency here?

34:24.437 --> 34:26.397
I'll cut to the chase.

34:26.481 --> 34:28.649
Stop this madness, right now.

34:30.026 --> 34:31.611
Give it up.

34:38.117 --> 34:40.078
What if I say I can't?

34:43.081 --> 34:45.208
I will summon you to the <i>Live Court Show</i>

34:46.459 --> 34:49.879
and expose all of your schemes.

34:50.755 --> 34:54.842
Until the angry citizens turn
this place into a sea of fire

34:58.596 --> 35:02.308
and drag you out by the collar,
like a dog.

35:05.269 --> 35:08.356
Honestly, psychos tend to

35:08.439 --> 35:10.942
go to the extremes, like this.

35:11.609 --> 35:14.153
You think it'll work hounding me like this

35:14.737 --> 35:16.072
when you have no proof?

35:16.989 --> 35:19.325
Don't make me laugh!

35:19.909 --> 35:22.995
Our people are terribly
frightened right now.

35:23.079 --> 35:25.081
So whose words
do you think they'll believe?

35:26.541 --> 35:30.086
Here's me, who's telling them to stay home
because strangers are dangerous,

35:30.670 --> 35:34.632
and there's you, telling them to take
to the streets to help strangers.

35:36.217 --> 35:37.927
Who do you think they'll choose?

35:38.010 --> 35:41.264
I see the small popularity
you enjoyed with the public

35:41.347 --> 35:43.683
has gotten to your head, but wake up!

35:43.766 --> 35:45.601
Those who rave about you

35:45.685 --> 35:49.480
and those who made me president

35:49.564 --> 35:51.566
are really no different.

35:51.649 --> 35:54.110
They're all the same. Did you know that?

35:55.153 --> 35:56.279
Now listen to me

35:57.196 --> 35:59.448
because I'm about to say something wise.

36:01.284 --> 36:03.327
Those who gave birth to me,

36:04.620 --> 36:06.998
gave birth to you, you bastard.

36:07.081 --> 36:08.916
Got that?

36:13.337 --> 36:15.715
All right, so you want to test your luck.

36:24.056 --> 36:26.434
You look great in yellow.

36:47.079 --> 36:48.414
This area is off-limits.

36:48.497 --> 36:49.790
Please stand back.

36:51.959 --> 36:54.587
-Judge Oh?
-Are things all going as planned?

36:54.670 --> 36:55.713
Pardon?

36:59.717 --> 37:00.927
Open up the gate.

37:04.430 --> 37:06.974
<i>My fellow Koreans, the deadly virus</i>

37:07.058 --> 37:10.144
<i>was once again discovered
in the slums of Hyeongsan-dong.</i>

37:13.856 --> 37:16.692
<i>We can overcome this once again.</i>
<i>No matter what crisis we face…</i>

37:25.034 --> 37:27.745
<i>My fellow Koreans, the deadly virus</i>

37:27.828 --> 37:30.665
<i>was once again discovered
in the slums of Hyeongsan-dong.</i>

37:31.457 --> 37:33.125
<i>We can overcome this once again.</i>

37:34.168 --> 37:37.255
<i>No matter what crisis we face,</i>

37:37.338 --> 37:38.714
<i>we will prevail.</i>

38:00.903 --> 38:03.030
<i>-Ms. Officer?</i>
-Yes, ma'am.

38:03.114 --> 38:07.410
You said to call you at any time
if I remember anything, right?

38:07.994 --> 38:10.579
<i>About Joseph,
who used to work at the cathedral.</i>

38:10.663 --> 38:11.497
Yes.

38:11.580 --> 38:13.874
Well, someone told me that they saw a man

38:13.958 --> 38:16.168
who looks like Joseph
in a neighborhood in Seoul.

38:16.252 --> 38:19.672
But they're not too sure either.

38:19.755 --> 38:21.882
That's okay.
Please tell me all that you know.

38:23.342 --> 38:24.593
Yes.

38:43.571 --> 38:44.613
Ga-on.

38:44.697 --> 38:45.781
You're here.

38:46.699 --> 38:49.493
Why are you out here?
I told you to be good and stay home.

38:49.577 --> 38:51.704
I thought you might be home now.

38:54.248 --> 38:56.625
Shut up. Let's go in.

39:06.719 --> 39:07.762
Su-hyeon.

39:09.847 --> 39:11.057
Yes?

39:12.016 --> 39:13.476
About what happened earlier…

39:15.144 --> 39:18.230
What do you mean?
Like anything ever happened.

39:19.315 --> 39:21.192
I won't apologize. But…

39:22.318 --> 39:24.195
I thought maybe I got the order wrong.

39:27.615 --> 39:28.824
Order?

39:33.829 --> 39:36.040
You know I'm a real coward, right?

39:40.836 --> 39:44.256
I was scared to death all day.

39:45.508 --> 39:47.676
In case that made things
awkward between us.

39:48.844 --> 39:50.679
In case it drove us apart.

39:52.264 --> 39:54.141
In fact, I've been like that all my life.

39:56.310 --> 39:58.562
What if…

40:00.356 --> 40:01.816
we start dating,

40:03.234 --> 40:05.945
then have a fight over something
trivial like everyone else,

40:06.904 --> 40:09.949
which causes misunderstandings,
jealousy, heartache…

40:11.909 --> 40:15.413
and eventually result in us breaking up?

40:16.080 --> 40:17.331
Then what?

40:17.998 --> 40:19.792
Because you're all I have.

40:22.211 --> 40:25.506
If I lose you, I'll have no one left.

40:28.092 --> 40:30.177
So I thought, as long as we stay friends…

40:31.720 --> 40:34.598
As long as we stay best friends,

40:34.682 --> 40:36.976
I wouldn't be lonely ever.

40:40.354 --> 40:41.772
I'm such a loser, aren't I?

40:42.982 --> 40:44.358
And selfish too.

40:46.193 --> 40:47.903
But I can't hold it back anymore.

40:47.987 --> 40:49.947
I don't need anything else.

40:50.030 --> 40:52.491
Let's fight over the trivial things
like everyone else,

40:52.575 --> 40:55.077
misunderstand each other,
get jealous, and get hurt.

40:59.582 --> 41:01.500
Because I just want to love you
for the rest of my life.

41:05.379 --> 41:07.715
I love you a lot, Su-hyeon.

42:51.110 --> 42:52.403
Kang Yo-han…

42:53.988 --> 42:57.283
What if he does have something against us?

42:58.909 --> 43:02.830
The quarantine authorities,
the media, the police and the prosecution.

43:02.913 --> 43:04.873
They're all under our control,
are they not?

43:04.957 --> 43:07.459
If we say there's a virus,
there is a virus.

43:07.543 --> 43:09.461
So how will he prove otherwise?

43:09.545 --> 43:12.089
It's not like he's going to carry
around a microscope to prove it.

43:12.172 --> 43:15.175
Still, I just don't have
a good feeling about this.

43:15.259 --> 43:17.094
If I could,

43:17.177 --> 43:21.557
I'd bury him somewhere in secret.

43:21.640 --> 43:25.144
But that would turn the country
upside-down.

43:29.565 --> 43:32.443
Chairwoman Jung, if you have
any good ideas, share them with us.

43:33.861 --> 43:36.238
If he still doesn't get our warning,

43:37.156 --> 43:38.574
we'll have to get rid of him.

43:40.117 --> 43:42.411
That's exactly how I feel!

43:42.494 --> 43:43.704
But if we do that--

43:43.787 --> 43:46.790
So let's start
by getting rid of his stage.

43:47.541 --> 43:48.584
His stage?

43:48.667 --> 43:52.296
Stars only shine bright
when they're on stage.

43:52.379 --> 43:54.214
Without their stage…

43:55.591 --> 43:57.509
they are just an average person.

44:02.389 --> 44:04.808
Ga-on, wake up. Quick!

44:04.892 --> 44:08.145
<i>Our government has decided to disband
the Department of Live Court Show</i>

44:08.228 --> 44:11.565
<i>and newly establish
the Department of Emergency Court</i>

44:11.649 --> 44:14.526
<i>to respond to the current state emergency.</i>

44:15.361 --> 44:17.613
<i>The Emergency Court will handle cases</i>

44:17.696 --> 44:21.492
on obstruction
of emergency quarantine and relief aid,

44:21.575 --> 44:25.746
production and circulation of propaganda,
and illegal demonstrations and protests.

44:25.829 --> 44:29.416
The Court will be presided by
Judge Oh Jin-joo,

44:30.084 --> 44:32.544
<i>and the associate judges will be nominated</i>

44:32.628 --> 44:35.047
<i>from those judges
with a strong view of the state.</i>

44:35.130 --> 44:37.091
-This is crazy.
<i>-That's all I have for now.</i>

44:37.174 --> 44:40.010
Su-hyeon, we need to stop this.

44:40.094 --> 44:42.346
They're deceiving
the entire country right now.

44:43.263 --> 44:45.849
There's just Judge Kang who can stop this.

44:46.517 --> 44:48.143
Ga-on, not Kang Yo-han.

44:48.227 --> 44:51.605
I know all these are very suspicious,
but how are we supposed to trust him?

44:51.688 --> 44:53.315
I'm telling you, he's dangerous.

44:53.399 --> 44:55.692
-Su-hyeon.
-Just wait.

44:56.610 --> 44:57.736
Just wait a little more.

44:58.320 --> 45:01.865
I'll expose Kang Yo-han's true face.
I'm almost there, Ga-on.

45:01.949 --> 45:03.033
Su-hyeon, please.

45:03.117 --> 45:04.785
Please trust me on this one.

45:04.868 --> 45:06.412
We need to stop this.

45:06.495 --> 45:09.248
Let's check him
after handling this situation.

45:10.124 --> 45:11.125
All right?

45:13.168 --> 45:14.420
Su-hyeon.

45:24.179 --> 45:25.931
Will it be possible?

45:26.014 --> 45:27.641
We'll have to try even if it isn't.

45:28.308 --> 45:31.812
I'll round up
the supporters one last time.

45:34.148 --> 45:37.151
We do have one with access
to the control room.

45:38.694 --> 45:39.695
Judge Kang.

45:42.114 --> 45:44.408
Let me call you back, Mr. Go.

45:49.288 --> 45:50.789
Will you just sit back and watch?

45:50.873 --> 45:55.043
The innocent are being beaten
and dragged away like dogs out there.

45:55.919 --> 45:58.005
So will you just sit back
and watch like this?

45:59.798 --> 46:00.966
Say something.

46:24.907 --> 46:27.201
OLD HOUSE, BLUE GATE, END OF THE STREET

46:35.125 --> 46:36.210
Is anyone in?

46:39.671 --> 46:42.466
-Who is it?
-Hello, may I ask you something?

46:42.549 --> 46:44.384
Do you know this person, by any chance?

46:45.093 --> 46:47.763
Not really, no.

46:47.846 --> 46:49.181
I see. Thank you.

46:56.813 --> 46:57.981
Is anyone in?

47:02.653 --> 47:03.904
Is anyone in?

47:15.624 --> 47:17.417
Congratulations, Judge Oh.

47:18.001 --> 47:20.546
Or should I say, Presiding Judge
of the Emergency Court.

47:20.629 --> 47:23.382
Let's keep this up until
you're our Chief Justice.

47:23.465 --> 47:25.008
We'll make it all happen for you.

47:27.386 --> 47:29.930
If you will,
how about you do a proper job with it?

47:30.013 --> 47:31.139
Pardon?

47:31.223 --> 47:35.561
Judge Kang still enjoys
great popularity despite everything.

47:35.644 --> 47:38.605
And I'll need to surpass him
as the new presiding judge.

47:40.065 --> 47:42.609
Do you not remember
Kang Yo-han's acceptance speech?

47:42.693 --> 47:45.654
You know, his "I am the power."

47:45.737 --> 47:48.115
You're saying your intro needs
more impact, are you?

47:48.198 --> 47:49.074
That's right.

47:49.157 --> 47:52.411
Seeing is everything
when it comes to public image.

47:53.704 --> 47:56.957
But it's not something a single
certificate of appointment can concoct.

47:57.040 --> 48:00.752
It's high-handed personnel administration.
In fact, I just stole my mentor's seat.

48:02.296 --> 48:03.880
So what can we do for you?

48:03.964 --> 48:06.008
Would you like to do
an inauguration speech?

48:06.091 --> 48:07.050
Yes.

48:07.134 --> 48:09.261
At the very place
where Kang Yo-han once stood.

48:09.344 --> 48:11.680
With Kang Yo-han and Kim Ga-on
in the background.

48:18.061 --> 48:20.022
Do you think
Kang Yo-han would agree to it?

48:22.649 --> 48:24.151
I'll convince him.

48:25.444 --> 48:28.447
I'll tell him
that we can't just let him go like this

48:28.530 --> 48:31.283
and we should at least hold
a farewell special for him.

48:31.366 --> 48:35.120
Also, I'll tell him
that I will honor his legacy.

48:37.414 --> 48:39.416
So you want a coronation.

48:42.294 --> 48:45.505
With Kang Yo-han passing
his crown over to you.

48:45.589 --> 48:47.841
Don't you think it'll look pretty?

48:47.924 --> 48:50.260
I think it'll get stellar ratings too.

48:55.349 --> 48:59.186
With this much attention
and the exclusive broadcasting rights…

49:08.612 --> 49:09.988
This is driving me mad.

49:10.739 --> 49:13.617
I've never directed a show
with such viewership,

49:13.700 --> 49:15.661
so must we let it end like this?

49:15.744 --> 49:17.245
Does that mean we're fired too?

49:18.747 --> 49:21.124
I hear they're launching
an Emergency Court.

49:21.208 --> 49:24.378
Hey, would you watch something like that?

49:25.212 --> 49:27.297
It's not like
it's an emergency court martial.

49:36.473 --> 49:37.724
Hello, Judge Oh.

49:38.684 --> 49:39.685
Yes.

49:41.269 --> 49:44.564
I truly appreciate it, Judge Oh.

49:45.148 --> 49:47.943
No misunderstandings.
I mean it from the bottom of my heart.

49:48.026 --> 49:49.486
Please accept it.

49:54.282 --> 49:55.575
Well…

49:55.659 --> 49:58.745
I know it's come to this
due to the state emergency,

49:58.829 --> 50:01.873
but I'm sure the <i>Live Court Show</i>
will be back once we come around.

50:01.957 --> 50:05.752
So let's tell people that
you are leaving it to Judge Oh until then.

50:05.836 --> 50:08.255
That will help you
with your return later--

50:08.338 --> 50:10.257
You need stooges, do you?

50:10.924 --> 50:12.426
Ms. New Presiding Judge.

50:12.509 --> 50:14.302
Judge Kim, let's not do this.

50:14.386 --> 50:15.512
Let's do it.

50:17.347 --> 50:18.432
Judge Kang!

50:19.599 --> 50:22.269
But you better do a good job
with the camera work.

50:22.352 --> 50:23.770
So I don't lose face.

50:23.854 --> 50:25.230
Don't you worry about that.

50:25.313 --> 50:27.691
I'll bet my career on it
and do an amazing job!

50:36.450 --> 50:37.826
Is anyone home?

50:52.466 --> 50:53.675
Yes?

50:55.260 --> 50:57.345
-Hello, I'm from the WAIS.
-Okay.

50:58.013 --> 50:58.972
Is Mr. Jung Joseph?

50:59.055 --> 51:00.474
No, not here.

51:00.557 --> 51:02.809
Then have you ever seen this man in your--

51:02.893 --> 51:06.271
No! Don't you know
we're in a state of emergency?

51:13.779 --> 51:15.030
Is anyone home?

51:24.623 --> 51:25.874
Who…

51:28.710 --> 51:29.795
Mr. Jung Joseph?

51:32.756 --> 51:33.673
Wait.

51:34.633 --> 51:36.301
I'm Yoon Su-hyeon from the WAIS.

51:46.228 --> 51:48.730
Don't you think
this will get us killer viewership?

51:49.397 --> 51:51.983
I mean, everyone will be
in their homes, watching TV.

51:52.484 --> 51:55.278
-Are we stopping by to eat first?
-What?

51:55.362 --> 51:58.198
They have been taking a long way around.

51:59.199 --> 52:00.450
You're right.

52:00.534 --> 52:02.369
That's strange. She never
mentioned anything like that.

52:02.452 --> 52:04.037
Do they want to stop by
the restrooms, perhaps?

52:05.914 --> 52:07.290
Hello, Judge Oh!

52:07.374 --> 52:10.585
<i>We have some time to spare, right?
Let's grab something to eat.</i>

52:10.669 --> 52:13.296
Sure, all right. Let's do that, then.

52:13.380 --> 52:14.297
Yes.

52:15.382 --> 52:16.967
She wants to grab something first.

52:31.857 --> 52:34.609
-Check the commercial breaks for me.
-Yes, sir.

53:27.120 --> 53:29.122
You can't come in here.

53:30.665 --> 53:32.000
What is it?

53:32.083 --> 53:34.544
-What's going on?
-My goodness!

53:34.628 --> 53:36.504
Help!

53:37.339 --> 53:38.715
We're ready to go live.

53:44.429 --> 53:47.933
Where do they want to take us anyway?
I don't see any restaurants around here.

53:54.230 --> 53:55.649
I'm sorry, Director.

53:55.732 --> 53:58.443
But you'll have a hit show this time.

53:58.526 --> 53:59.611
I promise.

53:59.694 --> 54:00.987
Yes, of course…

54:15.085 --> 54:16.294
What is going on there?

54:26.763 --> 54:27.847
What is all this?

54:28.598 --> 54:31.017
What are all these people doing?

54:31.810 --> 54:33.395
We should show them

54:33.478 --> 54:35.480
about what's really happening.

54:51.246 --> 54:52.706
Count me in too.

54:53.623 --> 54:54.666
Judge Oh.

54:55.458 --> 54:56.543
Judge Kim.

54:57.544 --> 54:59.004
I saw it.

55:00.672 --> 55:03.508
I know my ignorance
can't serve as an excuse.

55:07.053 --> 55:08.179
I'll do anything.

55:08.763 --> 55:11.099
I'm up for whatever I can.

55:11.933 --> 55:14.019
Will you really do whatever you can?

55:15.061 --> 55:16.604
Yes, Judge Kang.

55:17.772 --> 55:18.857
Good.

55:19.482 --> 55:21.026
It'll look more natural now.

55:31.202 --> 55:32.454
You're right.

55:33.121 --> 55:34.456
After seeing this,

55:35.874 --> 55:39.044
I can't call myself a journalist
if I don't report it.

55:39.711 --> 55:40.670
Gather around!

55:42.714 --> 55:44.632
-What is it?
-Tae-hyun!

55:44.716 --> 55:47.343
You go and get our cameras, hurry!

55:47.427 --> 55:48.595
I'm sorry, guys.

55:48.678 --> 55:51.598
I'm sorry about the change of plans.
But please believe in me.

55:51.681 --> 55:53.308
We're glad to have you on our team.

55:53.850 --> 55:55.894
Now let's go do our trial.

55:55.977 --> 55:56.895
Trial?

55:57.395 --> 55:58.605
Put these on first.

56:02.317 --> 56:03.902
Time for you to take to the stage.

56:46.444 --> 56:47.362
Judges!

56:48.655 --> 56:50.115
Let me take it from here.

56:51.407 --> 56:52.867
I'll be counting on you.

57:20.478 --> 57:22.230
Is the camera team on the rooftop?

57:22.730 --> 57:23.815
Yes, sir.

57:24.649 --> 57:27.735
All right, be careful.
Team A, you focus on the judges.

57:27.819 --> 57:29.988
Teams B and C,
get a close-up of the scene.

57:30.071 --> 57:32.031
Teams B and C, get close-ups of the scene!

57:32.115 --> 57:34.909
And I'll be following Judge Kang.
When is the generator truck coming?

57:34.993 --> 57:37.078
-We were in a rush, so…
<i>-But the sun's about to go down!</i>

57:37.162 --> 57:38.746
I said I'll assume full responsibility.

57:42.417 --> 57:43.460
One moment.

57:43.543 --> 57:44.711
Everyone.

57:45.795 --> 57:46.880
Everyone!

57:48.923 --> 57:50.258
Everyone!

57:52.510 --> 57:53.928
Fellow Koreans!

57:55.472 --> 57:57.891
We're currently at Hyeongsan-dong,
at the scene of emergency relief.

58:04.022 --> 58:05.023
What is that?

58:05.106 --> 58:07.609
<i>As you can see, this is the truth.</i>

58:07.692 --> 58:12.363
EXPOSES THE TRUTH
ABOUT EMERGENCY OPERATIONS

58:13.281 --> 58:15.533
Oh my, is that all real?

58:15.617 --> 58:18.578
All the footages you saw to date
are all lies.

58:19.204 --> 58:21.164
The government has been
hiding the truth from you

58:21.247 --> 58:25.710
<i>-to commit state violence.</i>
-What are you airing right now?

58:25.793 --> 58:26.753
<i>What?</i>

58:26.836 --> 58:28.129
<i>Are you in your right mind?</i>

58:28.213 --> 58:29.714
Well, you see…

58:29.797 --> 58:32.675
Enough of your nonsense.
Stop it right now!

58:32.759 --> 58:34.219
<i>Right now!</i>

58:36.095 --> 58:37.514
Contact Jukchang

58:37.597 --> 58:40.225
and tell him to deal with
Kang Yo-han right now.

58:40.308 --> 58:41.643
Do you understand?

58:42.477 --> 58:46.022
What are you doing? Get to work
if you're getting paid from the country!

58:46.105 --> 58:47.148
Yes, sir.

58:50.818 --> 58:51.986
<i>My fellow Koreans.</i>

58:52.654 --> 58:54.447
Please launch your Dike app,

58:54.531 --> 58:56.241
<i>and cast your vote.</i>

59:31.985 --> 59:33.027
Chuck it at them!

59:41.369 --> 59:42.787
Careful.

59:42.870 --> 59:46.082
Your neighbors are dying,
even as we speak.

59:46.165 --> 59:47.542
Will you continue to
just sit back and watch?

59:49.752 --> 59:52.255
The government has been blinding you.

59:52.922 --> 59:54.799
Now open your eyes.

59:54.882 --> 59:57.385
Open up!

59:57.468 --> 59:58.511
Stop the show!

1:00:05.310 --> 1:00:07.979
-You still haven't opened it? Move!
-There's no answer.

1:00:08.062 --> 1:00:09.022
Open up!

1:00:19.699 --> 1:00:23.202
THE LIVE COURT SHOW DEPARTMENT,
AT THE SCENE OF EMERGENCY RELIEF

1:00:44.974 --> 1:00:45.850
Are you all right?

1:00:48.603 --> 1:00:49.937
Are you all right?

1:00:50.021 --> 1:00:52.273
Yes, I'm fine.

1:00:52.357 --> 1:00:53.524
Please continue.

1:00:56.611 --> 1:00:57.612
Ga-on…

1:01:11.542 --> 1:01:12.960
Director, this way.

1:01:14.212 --> 1:01:15.213
Be careful.

1:01:40.446 --> 1:01:41.823
Judge Kang…

1:01:46.202 --> 1:01:48.579
They just stoned Judge Kang.

1:01:48.663 --> 1:01:50.498
They just stoned Judge Kang!

1:01:55.378 --> 1:01:56.671
Judge Kang!

1:01:56.754 --> 1:01:58.172
You ought to go to hell!

1:01:59.882 --> 1:02:03.553
No! Please stay put, Mister.

1:02:03.636 --> 1:02:06.180
He's…

1:02:06.264 --> 1:02:07.348
No!

1:02:24.282 --> 1:02:26.993
Kang Yo-han!

1:02:36.085 --> 1:02:37.628
Come down here.

1:02:37.712 --> 1:02:39.380
Come down here!

1:02:40.006 --> 1:02:45.762
Come down here!
I said come down right now!

1:02:46.637 --> 1:02:49.891
Come down here!

1:02:49.974 --> 1:02:51.476
Kim Choong-sik!

1:03:06.324 --> 1:03:07.784
It's time for you to come down.

1:03:09.494 --> 1:03:10.620
Well?

1:03:13.289 --> 1:03:14.415
Come on down.

1:03:22.256 --> 1:03:25.426
Then just cut off all the power
in that area!

1:03:25.510 --> 1:03:27.178
Cut it off!

1:03:27.261 --> 1:03:29.430
Cut all the power off!

1:03:32.141 --> 1:03:35.061
I'm not joking. Just do it.

1:03:37.980 --> 1:03:41.984
Smash all the TVs and kill all those guys
at the broadcasting station!

1:04:15.059 --> 1:04:17.603
-You can still watch it on the Dike app.
-Really?

1:04:18.271 --> 1:04:20.314
They must have cut off power
in that area too.

1:04:20.398 --> 1:04:21.315
You're right.

1:04:29.615 --> 1:04:32.118
Are the lights ready?
All right, in your positions.

1:04:33.411 --> 1:04:34.745
Wait!

1:04:58.144 --> 1:05:00.855
-What are they doing?
-Oh what?

1:05:01.480 --> 1:05:03.149
Let's take out our phones too.

1:05:04.066 --> 1:05:06.235
-Let's do this.
-All right.

1:05:06.319 --> 1:05:08.446
-What is going on?
-Turn it off!

1:05:10.740 --> 1:05:12.366
Turn it off!

1:05:21.167 --> 1:05:22.710
Like that will help!

1:05:23.419 --> 1:05:24.629
As if that will help!

1:05:26.297 --> 1:05:27.840
Turn the lights on, on my signal.

1:05:28.883 --> 1:05:30.092
Turn it on!

1:05:50.321 --> 1:05:51.322
Ready…

1:05:51.405 --> 1:05:52.406
Darkness…

1:05:52.490 --> 1:05:53.449
Go!

1:05:55.117 --> 1:05:56.786
…cannot prevail against the light.

1:06:12.885 --> 1:06:14.428
Now number two. Get ready.

1:06:16.347 --> 1:06:17.348
Darkness…

1:06:18.265 --> 1:06:21.227
cannot prevail
against the light, everyone!

1:06:51.632 --> 1:06:52.758
What…

1:06:56.178 --> 1:06:57.596
What is this?

1:08:21.722 --> 1:08:24.183
Damn it, that tenacious bastard…

1:08:31.899 --> 1:08:33.109
-Good work.
-Thank you.

1:08:33.192 --> 1:08:34.527
-Get some rest.
-Thanks.

1:08:34.610 --> 1:08:36.904
-Goodbye.
-Thanks for your hard work.

1:08:49.667 --> 1:08:50.626
Ga-on!

1:08:53.462 --> 1:08:54.964
-Ga-on.
-Su-hyeon.

1:08:55.673 --> 1:08:56.799
How did you get here?

1:09:02.221 --> 1:09:03.472
Wait…

1:10:15.628 --> 1:10:17.087
What…

1:10:20.049 --> 1:10:21.300
Su-hyeon.

1:10:21.884 --> 1:10:23.135
Su-hyeon.

1:10:31.769 --> 1:10:34.021
Su-hyeon…

1:10:41.570 --> 1:10:42.696
Su-hyeon…

1:10:46.742 --> 1:10:49.370
No… Su-hyeon…

1:10:50.537 --> 1:10:53.332
No, Su-hyeon! No…

1:11:00.506 --> 1:11:01.799
No…

1:11:03.092 --> 1:11:04.718
Are you hurt?

1:11:06.971 --> 1:11:08.013
No…

1:11:08.097 --> 1:11:09.515
Su-hyeon, no…

1:11:10.474 --> 1:11:14.228
I told you not to get hurt.
Why did you get hurt?

1:11:16.313 --> 1:11:18.065
No…

1:11:18.148 --> 1:11:20.317
Don't cry.

1:11:22.820 --> 1:11:25.406
Don't get yourself hurt, Ga-on.

1:11:28.075 --> 1:11:29.034
No…

1:11:30.327 --> 1:11:31.537
Su-hyeon…

1:11:35.332 --> 1:11:37.334
Ga-on, I love you.

1:11:38.794 --> 1:11:40.170
I love you.

1:11:55.269 --> 1:11:56.645
Su-hyeon…

1:12:10.242 --> 1:12:12.411
Su-hyeon!

1:12:18.250 --> 1:12:19.585
Su-hyeon!

1:12:19.668 --> 1:12:22.421
No, Su-hyeon!

1:12:25.174 --> 1:12:26.342
Su-hyeon…

1:12:30.095 --> 1:12:32.431
Help her, please!

1:12:32.514 --> 1:12:33.891
Su-hyeon…

1:13:21.522 --> 1:13:25.401
THANK YOU TO PARK HYOUNG-SOO
FOR HIS SPECIAL APPEARANCE

1:13:53.887 --> 1:13:55.180
<i>It must be hell.</i>

1:13:56.223 --> 1:13:58.934
I know because I'm down there too.

1:13:59.017 --> 1:14:02.938
If anyone tries to stop this trial,
they are the offenders.

1:14:03.730 --> 1:14:05.649
We should cut off the tail first.

1:14:06.233 --> 1:14:09.153
Don't tell me you're still not over him.

1:14:09.236 --> 1:14:11.530
<i>To get people to fight,</i>

1:14:11.613 --> 1:14:13.407
you needed the blood of a sacrifice.

1:14:13.490 --> 1:14:16.577
<i>That's what Kang Yo-han truly wants.</i>

1:14:16.660 --> 1:14:17.703
Fear.

1:14:17.786 --> 1:14:20.956
I'm asking whether you're sure
who it was that killed Su-hyeon.

1:14:21.039 --> 1:14:22.833
It will be a life for a life!

1:14:23.834 --> 1:14:25.127
<i>I propose the death penalty.</i>

1:14:27.671 --> 1:14:31.258
