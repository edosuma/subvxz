Well, your cholesterol level
is lethally high, Homer...

00:51.718 --> 00:54.516
but I'm more concerned
about your gravy level.

00:54.621 --> 00:59.923

Well, you're a little confused.

01:03.696 --> 01:05.960

like military service...

frenetic dancing
or good old-fashioned peewee football.

03:11.090 --> 03:15.686
There you go, Bart. Peewee football will melt
away those unsightly pounds and inches.

03:15.795 --> 03:19.162
- Yeah, but I could get seriously hurt.
- Then it's settled.

03:19.265 --> 03:22.166

- Cool!

That's right. A girl wants to
play football. How about that?

05:16.149 --> 05:21.052
Well, that's super-duper, Lisa. In fact,
we already have four girls on the team.

05:21.154 --> 05:24.453
- You do?
- Uh-huh. But we'd love to have you on board.

05:24.557 --> 05:28.960
Well, football's not really my thing.

05:29.062 --> 05:34.193
After all, what civilized person would play
a game with the skin of an innocent pig?

05:34.300 --> 05:37.201
Well, actually, Lisa,
these balls are synthetic.

05:37.303 --> 05:40.670
And for every ball we buy,
a dollar goes to Amnesty International.

05:40.773 --> 05:43.139

Hey, Flanders, you're the worst coach
this team has ever had!

05:59.392 --> 06:02.054
He's the only coach
this team has ever had.

06:02.161 --> 06:04.755
And the season hasn't
even started yet.

06:04.864 --> 06:07.890
Yeah, well, he's...
wearing that hat like an idiot.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.766
- You know, Homer, it's very easy to criticize.
- Fun too.

06:11.871 --> 06:16.308
All right, Wildcats, are you ready to
give 110%, take it one game at a time...

06:16.409 --> 06:18.400

06:18.511 --> 06:20.741

07:49.802 --> 07:53.101
Yeah, I'm telling you
Flanders can't coach at all.

Now I'm not the type to
have a grudge for no reason.

break in for a moment.

- Do you have a question for Sandy Koufax?

08:01.547 --> 08:04.983
Yes. Mr. Koufax, don't you think
Flanders is a big jerk?

Do you have a problem
with the way I'm coaching?

No. No. No, no. No.
It's just that, well, like I was yelling earlier...

could coach better than you.

Uh-huh? Half a brain, huh?

09:16.055 --> 09:19.456

- Do it.

What a surprise.

Now just because I'm his father,
he'll get no special treatment.

He calls me "Coach"

13:34.446 --> 13:37.973
- Help! Help, help! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
- Get him!

13:38.083 --> 13:40.711
- Look at him go!
- Ohh! Ohh- [Grunts]

13:40.820 --> 13:42.685
[Whistle Blows]

13:42.788 --> 13:45.222
Excellent ploy, Son.

13:45.324 --> 13:49.351
- You panicked, but you didn't lose your cool.
- Oh.

13:51.163 --> 13:53.222
- Bart, over here! Come on!
- Bart, come on!

13:55.568 --> 13:57.536
<i>Just throw It, doofus!</i>

14:00.639 --> 14:02.106
Ah, crap.

14:04.944 --> 14:09.005
Great debut, Son. You really settled in
after some early jitters.

14:09.114 --> 14:12.140
- Are you kidding? I reeked.
- Oh, really?

14:12.251 --> 14:15.379
Do reeky players
get the game ball?

14:15.487 --> 14:18.513
Hey, everybody,
let's hear it for Bart!

14:21.594 --> 14:26.691
- Give me a "B"?
- I won't give you a "B," but I'll tear you a new "A."

14:26.799 --> 14:30.701
If I wasrt your friend,
I'd tell you you sucked.

14:30.803 --> 14:36.036
You ruined our undefeated season!
You ruined everything, ruiner!

14:36.141 --> 14:39.440
- My sister likes you.
- Listen here, daddy's boy.

14:39.545 --> 14:43.140
You cost us one more game
and you're dead.

14:44.984 --> 14:47.578
You're going to heaven.

14:56.295 --> 14:58.195
Ohh!

14:58.297 --> 15:02.427
Oh, it's gonna take a miracle for me
to become a good quarterback.

15:04.837 --> 15:07.897
- Excuse me, son.
- Wow! Joe Namath.

15:08.007 --> 15:10.635
That's right. My car broke down
in front of your house.

15:10.743 --> 15:15.373
Oh, I cannot believe you are here. Do you
think maybe you could give me some pointers?

15:15.481 --> 15:18.609
Sure. There's only one thing
you need to know...

15:18.717 --> 15:21.151
- to be a great quarterback.
- <i>[Englne Starts]</i>

15:21.253 --> 15:24.780
<i>[Woman]Joe, honey, I fixed It.</i>
<i>It was just vapor lock.</i>

15:24.890 --> 15:27.552
Oh. Oops.
Hey, look, I gotta run.

15:28.894 --> 15:31.260
Remember what I told you.

15:31.363 --> 15:33.354
Okay, Bart, concentrate.

15:36.135 --> 15:39.764
- Remember what I told ya.
- Just one thing.

15:39.872 --> 15:42.636
- My car broke down.
- I'm Joe Namath.

15:42.741 --> 15:44.641
My car broke down.

15:44.743 --> 15:49.680
It was just vapor lock.
[Echoes]

15:49.782 --> 15:52.148
I'm dead.

15:52.251 --> 15:55.049
<i>So If I play,</i>
<i>the guys are gonna klll me.</i>

15:55.154 --> 15:58.555
If I don't, I'll be letting Homer down.
What am I gonna do?

15:58.657 --> 16:00.716
Well, I know you don't
want to disappoint Dad...

16:00.826 --> 16:04.626
- but how do you feel about lying to him?
- Good.

16:04.730 --> 16:07.961
Oh, you guys are so cut.

16:09.868 --> 16:11.859
Dad, I got some bad news.

16:11.971 --> 16:14.439
Oh, your mother's
not pregnant, is she?

16:14.540 --> 16:18.840
No. I got hit by a couple of cars.
I won't be able to play today.

16:18.944 --> 16:22.277
- [Both] Yes!
- Oh, boy.

16:22.381 --> 16:24.781
Well, I'll just have to
go to my backup plan.

16:24.883 --> 16:27.317
- Nelson, how's your arm feeling?
- Great!

16:27.419 --> 16:31.412
- Good. Take this note over to the referee.
- "We forfeit"?

16:31.523 --> 16:34.856
- What?
- We forfeit?

16:34.960 --> 16:39.158
Come on, guys. We can't play without Bart.
He's the heart of this team.

16:39.264 --> 16:43.064
- No, I'm not. I suck.
- It's true. He does.

16:43.168 --> 16:46.296
- Yeah, he does.
- Don't listen to them, Son.

16:46.405 --> 16:49.465
- I have total faith in you.
- [Grunts]

16:49.575 --> 16:53.306
You don't get it, do you? I don't want to be
your stupid quarterback!

16:53.412 --> 16:55.937
- I quit!
- What?

16:56.048 --> 16:57.948
Well, I got news for you, mister!

16:58.050 --> 17:01.542
You can't quit! You're cut!
You too, Milhouse.

17:01.653 --> 17:05.316
All right! Ahh!

17:07.425 --> 17:10.953
[Chomping]

17:14.400 --> 17:19.531
So, like I said, I've never had a tick
burrow in so deep.

17:19.637 --> 17:21.902
Little guy's just
got a mind of his own.

17:22.007 --> 17:25.943
- Mom, please! We're eating.
- Well, at least I'm making conversation.

17:26.045 --> 17:29.503
- May I be excused, Mom?
- Oh, so now you're quitting dinner too.

17:29.615 --> 17:32.914
- Homer, please.
- I didn't raise him to be a quitter, Marge.

17:33.018 --> 17:36.181
It must have been you.
You've quit every job you've ever had-

17:36.288 --> 17:40.247
cop, pretzel vender, church counselor,
professional gambler.

17:40.359 --> 17:42.224
He's doing what he thinks is best.

17:42.327 --> 17:47.287
Well, if quitting is the best,
maybe <i>I</i> should just quit <i>my</i> job.

17:50.102 --> 17:54.095
- Ahoy-hoy?
- Mr. Burns, this is HomerJ. Simpson...

17:54.206 --> 17:56.470
the father of the big quitter.

17:56.575 --> 18:00.170
Well, I just wanted to tell you
I'm a big quitter too.

18:00.279 --> 18:03.146
And I quit.

18:03.248 --> 18:08.379
- <i>[Marge] Homer, Mr. Burns can't see you wlnklng.</i>
- So- [Screams]

18:08.487 --> 18:10.682
Yellow, 25, hut!

18:10.789 --> 18:14.316
Go long! Go long!

18:14.426 --> 18:17.759
Ah, hell.
I'll do it myself.

18:23.302 --> 18:25.862
[Panting]

18:25.971 --> 18:27.996
I gotta quit smoking.

18:29.808 --> 18:32.299
We drove 2,000 miles for this?

18:32.411 --> 18:36.142
We're in the championship!
Way to go, team.

18:36.248 --> 18:38.546
Gee, thanks, Coach.

18:40.719 --> 18:44.314
Great game, Son.
Come on. I'm taking you to Hooters.

18:44.423 --> 18:46.755
Ah, I don't want to
bother Mom at work.

18:49.461 --> 18:53.022
Well, Bart, it looks like
it's just you and-

18:53.132 --> 18:55.100
Oh.

19:00.539 --> 19:02.370
[Female Electronic Voice]
I'll scratch you.

19:02.474 --> 19:04.772
- The hair! The hair!
- Slut!

19:04.877 --> 19:08.438
- Loser!
- Skank! Skank! Skank!

19:10.315 --> 19:12.840
I'm feeling kind of low, Apu.

19:12.951 --> 19:16.580
Got any of that beer that has candy
floating in it? You know, Skittlebräu?

19:16.688 --> 19:20.920
Such a product does not exist, sir.
I think you must have dreamed it.

19:21.026 --> 19:25.554
Oh. Well, then just give me a six-pack
and a couple of bags of Skittles.

19:33.839 --> 19:37.297
Hello, Son.
I want to apologize.

19:37.409 --> 19:39.707
I just go so caught up
trying to encourage you...

19:39.811 --> 19:43.247
I was blinded to
your stinky performance.

19:43.348 --> 19:48.342
If you forgive me, I promise
I'll never encourage you again.

19:50.322 --> 19:53.416
I've got lots of quarters.

19:53.525 --> 19:56.722
- [Electronic Tone]
- This thing only takes dollars.

19:56.828 --> 19:58.796
Ahh.

20:01.133 --> 20:03.260
You know, tomorrow's
the championship game...

20:03.368 --> 20:06.030
and I could sure use
a good offensive tackle.

20:06.138 --> 20:09.369
- But I thought Uter took my place.
- Consider him cut.

20:11.944 --> 20:14.105
[Panting]

20:19.952 --> 20:22.887
Wow! Homer coaching
in the championship game.

20:22.988 --> 20:24.956
You must be pretty proud
of your son.

20:25.057 --> 20:28.652
You'd think so, wouldn't ya?
[Snoring]

20:32.030 --> 20:34.760
- Time for one last play, Coach.
- Hold on. I'm working it out.

20:34.866 --> 20:38.063
[Vibrating]

20:38.170 --> 20:41.298
Okay, half of you vibrate that way,
two of you fall down...

20:41.406 --> 20:44.773
- Nelson, you just spin around in a circle.
- <i>[Slren Blarlng]</i>

20:47.312 --> 20:51.840
All right, I've got an arrest warrant here
for Nelson Muntz!

20:51.950 --> 20:54.680
Uh, which one of you
little punks is Muntz?

20:54.786 --> 20:57.016
Oh, no! My quarterback!
What are we gonna do?

20:57.122 --> 21:00.023
- It's okay, Dad. I can fill in for Nelson.
- Are you sure, Son?

21:01.793 --> 21:04.421
I knew I could count on you.

21:12.738 --> 21:16.868
- <i>[Crowd Cheerlng]</i>
- [Snoring]

21:16.975 --> 21:20.172
Hey- Ooh! Ohh!

21:23.248 --> 21:25.682
So what's the charge, Chief?
Vandalism? Smoking?

21:25.784 --> 21:28.685
You know what you did, Muntz.
Burglary and arson.

21:28.787 --> 21:32.382
- You're goir away for a long time.
- Wha-

21:32.491 --> 21:36.393
- [Siren Blaring]
- [Chuckles] Poor Bart.

21:36.495 --> 21:39.020
You know, we had
a lot of fun tonight.

21:39.131 --> 21:42.931
But there's nothing funny about...
vapor lock.

21:43.035 --> 21:46.300
It's the third most
common cause of car stallings.

21:46.405 --> 21:50.671
So please, take care of your car
and get it checked.

21:50.776 --> 21:53.836

Good night.
