she has to say,

It's true.

08:55.102 --> 08:56.201
What's true?

with one person...

09:02.075 --> 09:03.275
...in my entire life.

09:05.312 --> 09:06.778
And that was Ronnie,

09:06.780 --> 09:08.613
on the night that
he died five years ago.

09:09.983 --> 09:14.819
So, when I got pregnant,
I was scared and confused,

09:14.821 --> 09:18.123
and I didn't understand
how it was possible.

09:20.961 --> 09:22.027
But now I do.

09:22.896 --> 09:26.231

15:47.681 --> 15:49.514
I wanted to talk
to you guys about.

15:50.717 --> 15:52.583

15:52.585 --> 15:55.253
Since they've chosen
not to be involved,

15:56.690 --> 16:00.558
I was wondering...
I was hoping that

16:00.560 --> 16:03.695

be the guardians<i> ad litem.</i>

16:07.167 --> 16:09.334

16:09.335 --> 16:11.502
then you guys would be
in charge of me, and...

16:12.372 --> 16:15.540
And the baby.
Are you sure?

16:15.542 --> 16:21.079
Yeah.
I mean, you don't wanna
try to contact the father?

16:21.081 --> 16:25.216

I mean, a child needs a family.

16:25.218 --> 16:28.019

Okay, I'm not saying that I
believe her. All I'm saying

19:03.910 --> 19:05.593
is that if you think about it,

19:05.594 --> 19:07.277
there's a chance that
what she said is true.

frozen before he died,

19:18.625 --> 19:21.893
there's a chance that Melissa
could've used it, and
impregnated herself,

19:21.895 --> 19:24.762
years later, and thus
we would have Ronnie's baby.

19:25.698 --> 19:27.431

had a brother, Philip?

39:38.610 --> 39:42.145
This emptiness,
it's not gonna go away,

39:42.147 --> 39:44.714
because you're not
ready to be whole.

39:44.716 --> 39:48.551
You've tied yourself
to the world around you, but

39:48.553 --> 39:52.555
there's more answers than
those you can touch and see.

to believe in ghosts.

40:10.008 --> 40:15.078
And Melissa believes,
and it's true for her.

40:15.080 --> 40:18.081
But the question is,
what do you believe in?

40:22.454 --> 40:25.688
That's why you're running from
the things you find difficult.

40:26.825 --> 40:29.526
The things you find painful,

40:29.528 --> 40:32.128
you ignore, or ridicule.

40:33.498 --> 40:36.599
That's why you've
given up on yourself.
Okay...

40:36.601 --> 40:39.869
And you've
given up on everyone else.

40:41.440 --> 40:44.073
Find your truth,
whatever or whoever that is.

40:44.075 --> 40:46.943
Only then will you walk out
of the shadows.

No, no, no. You don't get
to tell me what to do.

44:28.099 --> 44:32.368
Yeah, so, I was just down in the
basement doing some laundry...

to restock the mops, okay?

44:36.675 --> 44:38.007

44:38.009 --> 44:39.909
<i> Yeah, and then</i>
<i> I was coming back out</i>

44:39.911 --> 44:42.178
and a sock rolled on the floor.

Yeah, and I don't know,
I did something to my back.

I heard it, so

I rather not make
dinner tonight,

45:11.342 --> 45:13.009

45:57.889 --> 46:00.957
What are you doing here?
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

46:02.393 --> 46:04.243
I'm here to see Philip.

46:04.244 --> 46:06.094
Oh, so you didn't bring
a big fat cheque with you?

46:06.097 --> 46:08.931
The alimony's direct deposit.
I've never missed a payment.

46:08.933 --> 46:11.901
Do you use the same account
to pay Melissa Moody's rent?

46:12.971 --> 46:14.370
Why would you do that?

46:14.372 --> 46:16.239
What else are you
keeping from me, Richard?

46:16.241 --> 46:18.108
Charlene...

46:18.109 --> 46:19.976
You just have this big
web of deceit going on,

46:19.978 --> 46:21.511
and now I have proof.

46:21.513 --> 46:24.013
You son of a bitch!
Okay, I am not
doing this right now.

46:24.015 --> 46:26.349
I can't think of
a better place to do it.
Enough!

46:27.318 --> 46:29.418
I'm here
to see Philip. That's it.

46:29.420 --> 46:32.188
Well, he's on my sofa, so you
might as well get in my car.

46:35.126 --> 46:36.325
(EXHALES)

46:38.797 --> 46:40.429
That false labor again?

46:41.966 --> 46:43.032
Yeah.

46:44.803 --> 46:46.302
What's it feel like?

46:46.304 --> 46:48.504
Feels... tight.

46:48.506 --> 46:51.340
Like everything's clamping up.

46:51.342 --> 46:52.842
Doctor says
I'll know the difference

46:52.844 --> 46:54.844
when it actually happens.

46:54.846 --> 46:56.913
When the baby comes, what then?

46:56.915 --> 46:58.481
Then I'll be a mom.

47:01.986 --> 47:03.553
Best job there is.

47:06.524 --> 47:08.524
Me and Gail
have tried to have kids.

47:09.994 --> 47:13.362
Gail's body just wouldn't take.

47:13.364 --> 47:17.133
We tried a bunch of times, but
she just kept losing them all.

47:17.135 --> 47:19.035
I didn't know that.

47:19.037 --> 47:22.004
I'm sorry.
It made it hard on us,

47:22.006 --> 47:23.606
as a husband and wife...

47:24.542 --> 47:27.009
as a couple.

47:27.011 --> 47:29.278
Ah, it's a beautiful thing,
having kids,

47:29.280 --> 47:30.580
raising them up.

47:30.582 --> 47:32.381
A man has
a lifetime of experience

47:32.383 --> 47:33.549
that he wants to pass down,

47:33.551 --> 47:35.618
something to leave behind.

47:36.888 --> 47:40.590
You know, um,
Gail will never say it, but

47:40.592 --> 47:46.062
she looks at you like
God brought us a little girl

47:46.931 --> 47:48.331
we never had.

48:05.617 --> 48:07.316
Okay. Here...

48:09.053 --> 48:10.653
Where are we?
No, no, no. It's a surprise.

48:10.655 --> 48:12.488
Okay. No peeking.

48:13.658 --> 48:16.158
You sure you don't wanna
go back to prom, and

48:16.160 --> 48:17.660
see the king
and queen announced?

48:17.662 --> 48:19.896
Think I'll live without it.
You want to?

48:19.898 --> 48:21.965
No.

48:21.966 --> 48:24.033
Little further. Little further.
Okay, right here.

48:24.035 --> 48:25.368
RONNIE: One second.

48:25.370 --> 48:26.569
Eyes closed.

48:28.406 --> 48:30.106
Okay, open your eyes.

48:31.910 --> 48:34.443
I still can't see anything.
I know, just one more second.

48:36.648 --> 48:38.214
(ACOUSTIC MUSIC PLAYING)

48:57.335 --> 48:58.634
Okay.
(RONNIE CHUCKLES)

49:01.572 --> 49:03.039
RONNIE: You like it?

49:03.041 --> 49:05.708
Did you do all this?
Phil helped a little.

49:08.079 --> 49:09.178
All right.

50:02.266 --> 50:03.466
I'm ready.

50:04.102 --> 50:05.234
It's perfect.

50:17.181 --> 50:18.280
Gail?

50:29.360 --> 50:30.426
Hon?

50:34.132 --> 50:35.264
Gail?

50:47.445 --> 50:48.511
Gail?

51:38.796 --> 51:41.130
You might wanna slow down.

51:41.131 --> 51:43.465
That's how you wanna start
this conversation? Try again.

51:44.669 --> 51:47.636
Yes, I have been
paying Melissa's rent.

51:47.638 --> 51:49.638
Oh, look at that?
A bit of truth.

51:49.640 --> 51:53.609
So, what makes a grown man pay
the rent of a woman... a girl,

51:53.611 --> 51:55.578
he hasn't seen in five years.

51:59.150 --> 52:00.983
You have seen her.

52:00.984 --> 52:02.817
Holy hell, Richard. You are
a regular bullshit factory!

52:02.820 --> 52:05.888
I come up to the city a couple
of times a year, Charlene.

52:05.890 --> 52:08.858
Barry and I still have
a stake at the medical plaza.

52:08.860 --> 52:10.860
You come in
and you don't call me?

52:10.862 --> 52:13.863
No! No, I don't tell you.

52:14.732 --> 52:16.265
You've made this impossible.

52:16.267 --> 52:18.634
You made it clear
you want nothing to do with me.

52:18.636 --> 52:20.302
Philip's in the city,

52:20.304 --> 52:23.339
and yes, I have seen Melissa.

(TIRES SCREECHING)

52:25.810 --> 52:27.443
(SIGHS)

52:27.445 --> 52:29.678
I knew it.
Oh, calm down, Charlene.

52:29.680 --> 52:32.848
I'm trying to help.
Maybe explain if I could.

52:32.850 --> 52:33.916
Can't wait to hear it.

52:37.522 --> 52:41.323
After Ronnie died, I wanted
to talk about it, Charlene.

52:42.627 --> 52:44.293
I couldn't do that
with you, could I?

52:44.295 --> 52:47.163
You were either curled up
playing dead, or lashing out

52:47.165 --> 52:49.899
and I sure as hell couldn't
lay my grief off onto Philip.

52:51.836 --> 52:53.202
So, everyday...

52:54.472 --> 52:57.339
my bubble just
got a little bit smaller.

52:57.341 --> 52:59.642
And I had no idea
how to make it stop.

53:01.312 --> 53:03.279
One day I was out jogging,

53:04.949 --> 53:07.683
down by the ravine,
not far from where Ronnie died,

53:09.787 --> 53:11.353
I saw her...

53:12.690 --> 53:13.756
Melissa.

53:15.693 --> 53:16.759
And I...

53:18.563 --> 53:20.462
I could have kept going,

53:20.464 --> 53:22.398
let her deal on her own,
but I didn't wanna do that.

53:22.400 --> 53:23.966
I wanted to talk
to her, I want to...

53:25.736 --> 53:28.537
to be with her. And somehow,

53:30.408 --> 53:32.374
I knew she needed me
in the same way.

53:59.437 --> 54:00.703
Shit.

54:08.279 --> 54:09.578
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

54:15.753 --> 54:17.853
MELISSA: Hey.
Hey.

54:17.855 --> 54:19.888
MELISSA: Come in.
Thanks for meeting me.

54:19.890 --> 54:21.824
MELISSA: Oh, no, of course.

54:21.826 --> 54:25.594
I'm really glad you called.
It's nice getting off work
early sometimes.

54:25.596 --> 54:28.797
Sit down. Can I get you
some tea or something?

54:28.799 --> 54:30.299
I just have herbal, but...

54:31.302 --> 54:33.369
No. Thank you though.

54:36.874 --> 54:38.040
Sorry about the...

54:39.310 --> 54:40.409
No.

54:48.019 --> 54:49.385
(EXHALES LOUDLY)

54:50.855 --> 54:52.621
We're quite
the pair, huh? (CHUCKLES)

54:53.024 --> 54:54.390
The blunder twins.

55:09.073 --> 55:10.339
You know, I lied.

55:11.676 --> 55:12.875
Hmm?

55:12.877 --> 55:14.476
About my leg.

55:14.478 --> 55:15.844
It wasn't a bike accident?

55:16.747 --> 55:17.813
It was a bike.

55:21.652 --> 55:22.985
Ronnie and I,

55:23.954 --> 55:25.587
we were supposed
to move to New York.

55:25.589 --> 55:27.022
I remember, yeah.

55:27.024 --> 55:29.425
He talked about it a lot.

55:29.894 --> 55:31.860
So, after...

55:33.331 --> 55:36.365
what happened,
once I was finished with school,

55:36.367 --> 55:39.501
I figured, you know, this is
what Ronnie and I said we'd do.

55:40.404 --> 55:42.004
So, I got a place...

55:43.441 --> 55:46.742
moved to New York. My dad
sent money to cover the rent.

55:48.079 --> 55:50.079
But...

55:50.081 --> 55:52.848
You know, we were supposed
to make it, you know?

55:52.850 --> 55:56.452
On our own,
so in comes the day job.

55:57.388 --> 55:59.521
Bike messenger.
In Manhattan?

55:59.523 --> 56:01.523
In Manhattan.

56:01.525 --> 56:04.526
(SCOFFS) I was actually
pretty good at it,

56:04.528 --> 56:06.495
but at the end
of the day I was alone.

56:07.665 --> 56:11.600
I met people,
but it wasn't the same.

56:13.404 --> 56:15.070
It wasn't what we planned.

56:17.742 --> 56:21.777
So, one day I got a package and
I'm cruising down Fifth Avenue,

56:22.513 --> 56:24.146
and, uh,

56:24.148 --> 56:27.049
in the corner of my eye,
I see this yellow

56:27.918 --> 56:29.051
Honda Prelude

56:30.087 --> 56:32.454
cruising alone,
20-30 miles an hour,

56:33.924 --> 56:35.090
and all I have to do,

56:36.627 --> 56:38.460
is turn the bike
a little to the left,

56:38.462 --> 56:39.762
and I miss him by a mile.

56:43.667 --> 56:44.767
But I don't turn.

56:46.470 --> 56:48.036
You weren't trying to...
No.

56:48.973 --> 56:51.440
No, I wasn't
trying to kill myself.

56:54.578 --> 56:58.046
I guess I just needed
a reason to leave.

57:00.017 --> 57:01.083
You know, to give up,

57:02.887 --> 57:06.522
without giving up.

57:15.032 --> 57:16.465
I should have tried harder

57:17.201 --> 57:18.500
with you.

57:19.904 --> 57:23.038
I know that now.
You left us.

57:23.040 --> 57:25.874
I did. I found a way
to move on, and you hadn't.

57:26.977 --> 57:28.777
I knew I'd fall
right back into it.

57:28.779 --> 57:30.145
So, I got the hell out.

57:31.982 --> 57:33.482
And I know what it did,

57:34.718 --> 57:37.953
to us, to Philip,

57:38.589 --> 57:39.922
we crumbled.

57:39.924 --> 57:41.723
I live with it everyday.

57:41.725 --> 57:43.592
What did you do to her, Richard?

57:47.865 --> 57:50.799
Charlene...
What did you do, Richard?

58:12.890 --> 58:14.523
Thank you

58:15.626 --> 58:16.925
for trusting me.

58:18.562 --> 58:20.762
The fact still remains I quit.

58:20.764 --> 58:23.765
I took a way out, but...

58:25.870 --> 58:27.236
God, here you are!

58:28.672 --> 58:30.272
As big as a house...
(CHUCKLES)

58:30.274 --> 58:33.041
...on the edge
of this giant step, and

58:33.043 --> 58:35.777
you still have the guts
to go toe-to-toe with my mother.

58:36.914 --> 58:38.547
And the whole goddamn town.

58:39.283 --> 58:40.716
You didn't quit.

58:42.052 --> 58:43.952
And I want you know
that you're not alone.

58:45.956 --> 58:49.558
I might not believe
that this is Ronnie's baby,

58:51.128 --> 58:53.829
but I believe
that you believe it.

58:53.831 --> 58:57.065
And I believe that Ronnie
would have believed it too.

58:58.035 --> 58:59.134
So,

59:00.771 --> 59:02.571
if that makes me an uncle,

59:04.675 --> 59:05.908
so be it.

59:09.313 --> 59:10.746
I mean,

59:12.850 --> 59:13.982
it's not like...

59:14.885 --> 59:18.053
it's not like I'm so sure, 24/7.

59:21.191 --> 59:24.192
Some days it's hard enough just

59:24.962 --> 59:26.094
waking up.

59:27.164 --> 59:30.699
Some days I wake up, and

59:31.902 --> 59:33.802
I don't remember
much of anything.

59:39.743 --> 59:43.779
MELISSA:<i> I pass out,</i>
<i> and I dream about Ronnie.</i>

59:45.182 --> 59:46.748

59:59.163 --> 1:00:01.163
<i> It feels different.</i>

1:00:03.267 --> 1:00:04.733
So, I make mistakes,

1:00:06.036 --> 1:00:08.103
I get confused,

1:00:08.105 --> 1:00:10.906
Join the club.
And I know...

1:00:11.942 --> 1:00:13.809
I know everybody talks about me.

come down here for a sec?

CHARLENE:<i> What</i>
<i> did you do to her?</i>

1:00:36.333 --> 1:00:38.767
Nothing. At first,
we just talked...

1:00:40.170 --> 1:00:41.670
About Ronnie,

1:00:41.672 --> 1:00:44.239
and that silly accent
he used to do.

1:00:44.241 --> 1:00:46.241
His clothes, anything.

1:00:47.378 --> 1:00:49.011
After a while,

1:00:49.013 --> 1:00:52.381
we filled in the gaps where
our normal lives fell apart.

1:00:53.884 --> 1:00:56.952
Melissa's parents found out.
They didn't approve.

1:00:56.954 --> 1:00:58.920
I guess it got heated
and she moved out,

1:00:58.922 --> 1:01:00.689
and I felt like I
owed it to Ronnie to

1:01:01.258 --> 1:01:03.025
take care of her.

1:01:03.027 --> 1:01:05.360
Got her a place, paid the rent,

1:01:06.830 --> 1:01:09.064
gave her some
spare cash the first year.

1:01:10.968 --> 1:01:12.167
And the next.

1:01:15.439 --> 1:01:18.240
After a while,
it just became a habit.

1:01:19.376 --> 1:01:21.443
Like anything else.

1:01:21.445 --> 1:01:23.011
So, you didn't sleep with her?

1:01:24.448 --> 1:01:26.748
Christ! No, Charlene.

1:01:28.385 --> 1:01:29.951
Of course not.

1:01:31.855 --> 1:01:32.988
Who would do that?

1:01:33.957 --> 1:01:35.257
It's like I'm trying
to find my way out

1:01:35.259 --> 1:01:36.858
of one of those corn mazes

1:01:36.860 --> 1:01:38.326
that they put up
at Thanksgiving,

1:01:39.797 --> 1:01:43.799
and I'm going down a different
path than everyone else.

1:01:45.769 --> 1:01:47.369
But I know it's the right one.

1:01:51.041 --> 1:01:52.174
<i> Meanwhile, everyone else is</i>

1:01:52.176 --> 1:01:54.342

how wrong everyone else is.

1:01:59.283 --> 1:02:03.218
But, I figure if I go my way,

1:02:05.322 --> 1:02:06.922
and you go yours,

For what?

1:02:26.176 --> 1:02:27.342
For the cigarettes.

1:02:28.946 --> 1:02:30.779
I see you found 'em.

1:02:30.781 --> 1:02:34.282

1:02:34.284 --> 1:02:37.185

I understand.

because I thought you were sick.

know who the father is
