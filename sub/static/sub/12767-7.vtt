19:55.083 --> 19:57.041
AND IT MAKES
MY STOMACH FEEL ALL...

19:57.083 --> 19:59.959
YOU KNOW WHAT?
MAYBE I'LL SKIP FOOD TODAY.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.583
I ATE ENOUGH AT THAT PARTY FOR
A WEEK. HEY, WE MISSED YOU.

20:02.625 --> 20:05.750
OH, I WAS DOING ACUPUNCTURE.
MEG IS TRYING TO QUIT SMOKING.
GOOD FOR HER.

20:05.792 --> 20:09.583
WHAT?
I THINK SHE'S QUITTING FOR ME.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.

20:09.625 --> 20:12.208
M-MAYBE THAT SHE CARES.
MAYBE.

20:12.250 --> 20:15.041
YOU DON'T LIKE HAVING HER BACK.
I DON'T THINK
SHE LIKES BEING BACK,

20:15.083 --> 20:17.583
EXCEPT WHEN SHE'S WITH ME.
'CAUSE YOU'RE GOOD COMPANY.

20:17.625 --> 20:20.041
SHE'S QUITTING FOR ME,
SHE CAME BACK FOR ME,

20:20.083 --> 20:24.583
AND I JUST DON'T FEEL LIKE
IT'S ABOUT ME.

20:24.625 --> 20:27.417
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

20:27.458 --> 20:29.417
THE VASCULATURE
IS MORE COMPLICATED

20:29.458 --> 20:32.000
THAN THE ULTRASOUND SHOWED.
YEAH, BUT YOU CAN GET IT.

20:32.041 --> 20:34.208
I CAN, IF I COULD JUST--
(monitor beeping erratically)

20:34.250 --> 20:37.792
SHE'S HAVING A HYPERTHERMIC
REACTION TO THE ANESTHETIC.
ALL RIGHT, GET SOME ICE

20:37.834 --> 20:39.792
AND A COOLING BLANKET.
LET'S START AN I.V. DRIP

20:39.834 --> 20:41.667
OF DANTROLENE.
I'M REMOVING THE TROCARS.

20:41.709 --> 20:44.667
WE GOTTA GET HER OFF THE TABLE
OR WE'RE GONNA LOSE THEM ALL.

20:50.083 --> 20:51.583
TESS IS OKAY,

20:51.625 --> 20:54.792
AND SO ARE THE BABIES
FOR NOW.

20:54.834 --> 20:57.083
BUT I WASN'T ABLE
TO COMPLETE THE PROCEDURE,

20:57.125 --> 20:59.250
AND TESS IS TOO WEAK
TO TRY AGAIN.

20:59.291 --> 21:01.041
SO--SO YOU--YOU CAN'T--

21:01.083 --> 21:02.917
WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING
RIGHT NOW.

21:02.959 --> 21:05.917
YOU TALKED ME INTO IT,
AND I TALKED TESS INTO IT.

21:05.959 --> 21:08.083
I MADE HER GO AGAINST
WHAT SHE BELIEVES.

21:08.125 --> 21:10.500
AND NOW...

21:10.542 --> 21:13.041
NOW THEY'RE GONNA DIE.

21:20.750 --> 21:23.291
YOU'RE IN A GOOD MOOD?
YOU TOOK THE MORNING OFF.

21:23.333 --> 21:25.875
I THOUGHT SOMETHING
MIGHT BE WRONG.
NO, I WAS JUST TIRED
AND HUNGOVER.

21:25.917 --> 21:28.041
AFTER THE PARTY LAST NIGHT,

21:28.083 --> 21:30.041
I WAS CAPTAIN von TRAPP,
CHARLOTTE WAS A NUN.

21:30.083 --> 21:31.709
WE WERE CELEBRATING.

21:31.750 --> 21:34.709
CELEBRATING?
SHE MIGHT MOVE IN.

21:34.750 --> 21:37.709
OH, DON'T EVEN SAY IT.
I TOLD YOU ABOUT THIS.

21:37.750 --> 21:41.083
IT'S GOOD. IT'S A GOOD THING.
IT'S HEALTHY.

21:41.125 --> 21:43.875
THE CONSTRUCTION
ON THE FOURTH FLOOR

21:43.917 --> 21:45.875
IS FOR A COMPETING
MEDICAL PRACTICE

21:45.917 --> 21:48.750
THAT CHARLOTTE
IS GOING TO BE RUNNING.

21:48.792 --> 21:52.083
I WANTED TO TELL YOU. IT'S BEEN
KILLING ME TO KEEP IT A SECRET.

21:52.125 --> 21:53.667
BUT SHE SAID
THAT SHE WOULD TELL YOU,

21:53.709 --> 21:56.709
AND YOU'VE BEEN SO HAPPY.
AND YOU'VE KNOWN THIS
FOR HOW LONG?

21:56.750 --> 21:59.667
I WANTED TO TELL YOU!
WELL, YOU SHOULD'VE!

22:04.750 --> 22:06.750
(Dell) THIS IS BAD, ISN'T IT?
(Addison) YES, DELL, IT'S BAD.

22:06.792 --> 22:08.000
COME ON. HOW BAD
IS IT REALLY?
WELL, LET'S SEE.

22:08.041 --> 22:09.375
CHARLOTTE IS THE CHIEF
OF STAFF AT ST. AMBROSE.

22:09.417 --> 22:11.500
HOW MANY OF US
HAVE GOTTEN REFERRALS

22:11.542 --> 22:13.500
FROM DOCTORS AT ST. AMBROSE?
WELL, YOU CAN KISS
ALL THOSE GOOD-BYE.

22:13.542 --> 22:16.542
CHARLOTTE KING--OF ALL
THE PAINS IN THE ASSES.
GOD, POOR COOPER.

22:16.583 --> 22:20.041
(Pete) HOW'D HE FIND OUT?
I-I TOLD HIM.
I'VE KNOWN A COUPLE DAYS.

22:20.083 --> 22:22.917
WHAT?
CHARLOTTE'S HIS GIRLFRIEND,
AND SHE WANTED TO TELL HIM, SO--

22:22.959 --> 22:25.792
WHY WOULDN'T YOU TELL US?
OH, OKAY. ANYBODY ELSE
AROUND HERE HELD SECRETS

22:25.834 --> 22:28.333
THE LAST COUPLE MONTHS?
I'M ON YOUR SIDE.
OH, GOOD.

22:28.375 --> 22:31.291
WE'RE ALL ON THE SAME SIDE,
AND WE ARE STILL SCREWED.

22:31.333 --> 22:33.917
CAN THIS DAY GET ANY WORSE?
YEAH, WELL, I THINK IF
MAYBE WE HADN'T--

22:33.959 --> 22:35.959
IF YOU TELL ME I SHOULDN'T
HAVE RENTED THE FOURTH FLOOR,

22:36.041 --> 22:38.000
I MAY BREAK A DOOR.

22:42.250 --> 22:44.583
HEY,
YOU CAN'T GO BACK THERE.

22:48.667 --> 22:51.417
COOPER.
YOU USED ME.
YOU SLEPT WITH ME.

22:51.458 --> 22:53.417
YOU HEARD ABOUT
OUR FINANCIAL PROBLEMS,

22:53.458 --> 22:56.333
OUR FOURTH FLOOR PROBLEMS,
AND YOU SWOOPED IN AND WHAT?

22:56.375 --> 22:59.125
WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?
DON'T YOU DARE COME DOWN HERE
USING THAT TONE WITH ME.

22:59.166 --> 23:00.875
THIS IS BUSINESS,
AND WE'RE PERSONAL.

23:00.917 --> 23:02.792
AND I COULDN'T TELL YOU
BECAUSE I SIGNED

23:02.834 --> 23:05.041
A NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENT
WHEN THEY HIRED ME,

23:05.083 --> 23:07.041
AND UNTIL
THIS PLACE WAS STAFFED,

23:07.083 --> 23:10.041
I COULDN'T TELL ANYONE.
BUT VIOLET'S KNOWN FOR--

23:10.083 --> 23:12.583
VIOLET FOUND OUT SOMETHING
SHE SHOULDN'T.

23:12.625 --> 23:16.417
I TOLD HER I WOULD FIND THE TIME
TO TELL YOU WHEN I COULD.

23:16.458 --> 23:18.834
NOW YOU KNOW.
I'M GLAD YOU KNOW.

23:22.458 --> 23:25.250
(Violet) SO WHEN YOU
LOOK AT THE PICTURES,

23:25.291 --> 23:27.250
THE PICTURES
OF THE LITTLE GIRLS,

23:27.291 --> 23:30.667
WHAT DO YOU FEEL?

23:30.709 --> 23:34.041
LIKE...
I WANT TO BE WITH THEM.

23:34.083 --> 23:35.375
YOU WANT TO HURT THEM?

23:35.417 --> 23:37.041
NO. NO.

23:37.083 --> 23:39.792
JUST TOUCH THEM SEXUALLY?

23:39.834 --> 23:42.625
THE GIRLS IN THE PICTURES...

23:42.667 --> 23:45.208
THEY'RE FANTASIES.

23:45.250 --> 23:48.417
I DON'T FEEL...

23:48.458 --> 23:51.917
AS GUILTY...

23:51.959 --> 23:54.000
ABOUT WANTING TO TOUCH THEM.

23:56.083 --> 23:57.625
AS GUILTY AS?

23:57.667 --> 23:59.041
JODY.

24:01.542 --> 24:03.041
JODY SAMPICA.

24:03.083 --> 24:08.041
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT JODY?

24:08.083 --> 24:11.041
COME ON. NOW IS THE TIME
TO BE HONEST.

24:11.083 --> 24:12.250
WE HAVE TO FACE THIS.

24:12.291 --> 24:16.041
I DON'T WANT TO HURT HER.

24:16.083 --> 24:18.458
I-I JUST...

24:20.500 --> 24:23.083
I JUST WANT TO BE WITH HER.

24:24.500 --> 24:27.667
I, UH...

24:27.709 --> 24:31.500
I IMAGINE DRIVING OVER
TO HER HOUSE

24:31.542 --> 24:35.458
AND, YOU KNOW,
STOPPING AND TALKING

24:35.500 --> 24:39.333
AND... AND THEN...

24:39.375 --> 24:43.500
SHE GETS INTO THE CAR...

24:43.542 --> 24:45.667
AND I TAKE HER.

24:45.709 --> 24:49.458
AND WE DRIVE SOMEWHERE...

24:49.500 --> 24:53.166
AWAY FROM EVERYONE ELSE.

24:53.208 --> 24:56.500
IT SEEMS LIKE YOU THOUGHT
A LOT ABOUT THIS.

24:56.542 --> 25:01.041
I-I-I JUST WANT TO...
TALK TO HER.

25:03.041 --> 25:05.375
JUST TALK?

25:05.417 --> 25:07.375
IS THAT WHAT HE TOLD YOU,

25:07.417 --> 25:10.542
THE MAN WHO ABUSED YOU?

25:10.583 --> 25:13.041
HE JUST WANTED TO TALK.

25:13.083 --> 25:14.917
(sobs)

25:14.959 --> 25:19.375
HAL, YOU WANT TO DO MORE
THAN JUST TALK TO JODY.

25:19.417 --> 25:21.041
I DON'T...

25:21.083 --> 25:25.417
I DON'T WANT TO DO
ANYTHING WRONG.

25:25.458 --> 25:28.458
(crying)

25:32.458 --> 25:33.959
(elevator bell dings)

25:34.000 --> 25:36.417
(laughs) OKAY. ALL RIGHT,
I'M GONNA GO GET MY WALLET.

25:36.458 --> 25:39.375
YOU HANG HERE.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
OKAY, I'M FINE.

25:39.417 --> 25:40.834
(Addison) HEY, KEVIN. IT'S ME.

25:40.875 --> 25:43.375
LOOK, I KNOW
YOU DIDN'T HAVE A GOOD TIME

25:43.417 --> 25:44.834
AT THAT PARTY LAST NIGHT,

25:44.875 --> 25:46.834
BUT I HAVEN'T HEARD FROM YOU
ALL DAY.

25:46.875 --> 25:48.834
WILL YOU CALL ME, PLEASE? BYE.

25:48.875 --> 25:52.041
(sighs) CHARLOTTE STANDS READY
TO EAT AWAY AT OUR PRACTICE,

25:52.083 --> 25:54.375
THOSE THREE BABIES
ARE PROBABLY GONNA DIE,

25:54.417 --> 25:56.041
AND I CAN'T DO ANYTHING.

25:56.083 --> 25:58.625
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE
SO LATE?
PLEASE DON'T ASK ME THAT.

25:58.667 --> 26:03.000
YOU'RE SEEING ARCHER AGAIN?
LOOK, LOOK, I-I KNOW WE WERE
JUST GETTING BACK TO NORMAL,

26:03.041 --> 26:05.375
AND I--AND I DON'T WANT
TO UPSET THAT.

26:05.417 --> 26:08.583
BUT I WANT TO BE ABLE TO
SIT DOWN WITH MY BEST FRIEND

26:08.625 --> 26:10.583
AND TELL HER
WHAT'S HAPPENED TO ME.

26:10.625 --> 26:13.000
I'VE NEVER HAD SEX WITH ANYONE
OTHER THAN SAM,

26:13.041 --> 26:16.000
AND I DIDN'T KNOW THAT SEX
WITHOUT LOVE COULD BE ANY GOOD,

26:16.041 --> 26:17.583
BUT IT... IT WAS GREAT.

26:17.625 --> 26:19.583
I'M SORRY IT WAS YOUR BROTHER.

26:19.625 --> 26:22.792
YOU SLEPT WITH ARCHER?

26:22.834 --> 26:24.667
LOOK, SAM--

26:24.709 --> 26:27.417
AND YOU'RE OKAY WITH THIS?
'CAUSE I'M NOT OKAY WITH THIS.

26:27.458 --> 26:30.291
HEY, SAM.
WHAT'S UP WITH YOU? OH!
(Naomi) SAM!

26:30.333 --> 26:32.500
(Addison) SAM! ARCHER.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

26:32.542 --> 26:34.709
SAM.
HEY, LOOK, I DIDN'T--

26:34.750 --> 26:37.667
YEAH, BUT YOU DID,
DIDN'T YOU?
LOOK, SAM,
THIS IS NOT YOUR PLACE.

26:37.709 --> 26:40.500
NO, BUT THIS IS MY PLACE,
AND I HAVE TO COME HERE

26:40.542 --> 26:42.250
AND HEAR ABOUT THIS?
OK--

26:42.291 --> 26:44.500
EVERYBODY, LET'S JUST...

26:44.542 --> 26:47.041
OH, GOD.

26:47.083 --> 26:49.041
HEY, GET THE HELL
AWAY FROM HER!

26:49.083 --> 26:51.291
I WASN'T--
(Violet) DELL! DELL!

26:51.333 --> 26:53.291
WHAT DID YOU SAY
TO MY DAUGHTER?
I WASN'T DOING ANYTHING!

26:53.333 --> 26:56.041
WHAT DID YOU DO?
(Naomi) DID HE HURT YOU?
DID HE TOUCH YOU?

26:56.083 --> 26:57.417
(Maya) WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHO IS HE?
HAL.

26:57.458 --> 26:59.208
NO.
DR. TURNER!

26:59.250 --> 27:01.500
(Violet) GO HOME, NOW.
IT'S OKAY.
HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

27:01.542 --> 27:04.083
(Sam) WHAT DID HE SAY TO YOU?
(Maya) NOTHING.

27:04.125 --> 27:06.542
OKAY. IT'S OKAY.

27:12.083 --> 27:14.041
I JUST--I SAW HIM THERE,
AND--

27:14.083 --> 27:17.041
I KNOW, I KNOW. WE ALL
THOUGHT THE SAME THING.

27:17.083 --> 27:19.041
NO, OKAY. I THOUGHT ABOUT
MY DAUGHTER.

27:19.083 --> 27:20.750
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT ME.

27:20.792 --> 27:23.750
I HAVE A 6-YEAR-OLD GIRL
WHOSE MOTHER IS A DRUG ADDICT

27:23.792 --> 27:26.709
HANGING AROUND BAD PEOPLE,
AND I CAN'T CONTROL IT.

27:26.750 --> 27:28.709
AND ALL I CAN DO IS PRAY

27:28.750 --> 27:30.709
THAT BETSEY'S SAFE
FROM PEOPLE LIKE HAL,

27:30.750 --> 27:33.041
BUT I CAN'T PROTECT HER
AND I HATE IT.

27:33.083 --> 27:36.166
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT
IT'S LIKE TO BE VICTIMIZED.

27:42.959 --> 27:47.792
I WAS 20, IN COLLEGE...

27:47.834 --> 27:53.709
AND, UH,
A MAN BROKE INTO MY DORM...

27:53.750 --> 27:58.041
AND IT WAS AWFUL...

27:58.083 --> 27:59.792
AND VIOLENT...

27:59.834 --> 28:04.375
AND... AWFUL.

28:06.041 --> 28:08.041
PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND ME,

28:08.083 --> 28:11.000
WE TURN A NEGATIVE
INTO SOMETHING POSITIVE,

28:11.041 --> 28:12.750
HELPING PEOPLE.

28:12.792 --> 28:14.750
BUT PEOPLE LIKE HAL...

28:14.792 --> 28:17.625
THEY'RE VICTIMIZED, AND THEY
JUST HURT MORE PEOPLE.

28:17.667 --> 28:21.000
THEY CAUSE MORE PAIN.

28:21.041 --> 28:23.625
I SAW HIM WITH MAYA AND...

28:23.667 --> 28:25.625
I KNOW WHAT HE THINKS ABOUT.

28:25.667 --> 28:28.625
I MEAN, THERE'S--THERE'S THIS
GIRL HE KEEPS THINKING ABOUT,

28:28.667 --> 28:31.625
AND I DON'T KNOW IF WHAT HE'S
THINKING ABOUT IS A PLAN

28:31.667 --> 28:34.625
OR IF IT'S JUST SOMETHING
THAT'S GONNA STAY IN HIS HEAD.
YOU HAVE TO STOP HIM.

28:34.667 --> 28:36.625
WELL, IT'S NOT A CRIME
TO THINK BAD THINGS.

28:36.667 --> 28:38.792
HE HASN'T DONE ANYTHING.
YEAH, BUT HE WANTS TO.

28:38.834 --> 28:41.583
HE WANTS TO GET BETTER.
IS THAT ENOUGH?

28:49.834 --> 28:52.834
HEY. DID, UH, MAYA
FINALLY GET TO SLEEP?

28:52.875 --> 28:54.375
YEAH.

28:54.417 --> 28:55.792
SHE SAID SHE FELT DUMB

28:55.834 --> 28:58.583
THAT SHE COULDN'T FIGURE OUT
THAT HE WAS A BAD GUY.

28:58.625 --> 29:00.917
I SHOULD'VE NEVER
LEFT HER ALONE.

29:00.959 --> 29:04.041
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT SORRY
THAT I PUNCHED ARCHER.

29:04.083 --> 29:07.041
WELL, YOU KNOW, YOU FLIRT
WITH GIRLS IN FRONT OF MY FACE

29:07.083 --> 29:09.417
AND GET SET UP ON DATES
IN THE OFFICE.

29:09.458 --> 29:11.417
I KNOW.
I MEAN, I KNOW IT HERE.

29:11.458 --> 29:12.875
I JUST--I...

29:12.917 --> 29:14.417
I NEVER EXPECTED YOU

29:14.458 --> 29:17.250
TO BE THE FIRST ONE OF US
TO MOVE ON.

29:17.291 --> 29:20.041
NEITHER DID I.

29:20.083 --> 29:22.208
UGH. DID IT
HAVE TO BE ARCHER?

29:22.250 --> 29:24.208
I DIDN'T PLAN IT, SAM.

29:24.250 --> 29:26.041
BUT IT HAPPENED.

29:26.083 --> 29:28.041
AND I'M NOT SORRY IT DID.

29:28.083 --> 29:31.041
I MEAN, YOU'RE ALWAYS TALKING
ABOUT WANTING TO LIVE YOUR LIFE.

29:31.083 --> 29:33.208
I'M NOT GONNA FEEL BAD
FOR DOING THE SAME.

29:33.250 --> 29:35.208
THAT'S WHY WE GOT DIVORCED,
ISN'T IT,

29:35.250 --> 29:37.875
TO LIVE OUR LIVES,
TO BE ALIVE?

29:37.917 --> 29:40.917
IT'S GOOD.
YOU SHOULD TRY IT.

29:40.959 --> 29:43.458
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GLAD IT WAS ME FIRST

29:43.500 --> 29:46.250
BECAUSE NOW WHEN IT'S YOU,
I'LL KNOW IT'S OKAY.

29:53.917 --> 29:56.500
(door opens and closes)
