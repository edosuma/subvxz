You said your Parents weren't
gonna Post his bail anymore.

37:08.570 --> 37:10.540

37:30.830 --> 37:33.490
l mean. not that it's bad.
but everything made out of wax?

37:33.660 --> 37:35.860
Don't you think that's a little weird?

37:39.470 --> 37:41.130
Those aren't wax.

37:42.340 --> 37:44.070
Oh. whatever.

37:44.340 --> 37:46.360
When do you think
the last Person was here?

A while. Probably.

37:51.980 --> 37:54.310
-What? What is it?
-l just saw someone.

37:56.950 --> 37:58.980
-lt was Probably just a wax thing.
-No. no.

37:59.150 --> 38:02.090
lt wasn't a wax thing. lt was moving
and it was freaky-looking.

38:02.260 --> 38:04.020
l'll go check it out.

38:04.330 --> 38:06.990

38:07.160 --> 38:09.260
-Wade. come on.
-Hang here a second.

38:09.430 --> 38:11.590
No. Wait.

40:02.710 --> 40:04.800
-What's wrong?
-This Place is freaking me out.

40:04.980 --> 40:07.640
-Calm down. There's no one here.
-Please. l just wanna go.

40:07.820 --> 40:10.610
Okay. Okay. We'll go

40:11.990 --> 40:15.220
Oh. dude. l had to Pee so bad. man.

40:19.330 --> 40:21.020
Come on. dude.

-Why? We can go.

40:32.410 --> 40:36.370
-Oh. baby. Come on. l'm tired of driving.
-Okay.

40:37.150 --> 40:39.510
Why don't you let my man drive.

40:39.680 --> 40:41.080

40:42.250 --> 40:44.280
-You heard him. Move.
-Give me the damn keys.

40:44.450 --> 40:47.150
Okay. Very slow. Thank you.

40:48.120 --> 40:50.720
l don't think this is cool.
just coming in like this.

40:50.890 --> 40:53.020
What? Look. the door was unlocked.

40:53.190 --> 40:55.720
He said he'd be half an hour.
he's been 45 minutes.

40:55.900 --> 40:57.260
l'm sure he won't mind.

40:57.430 --> 41:00.270
You know. if your brother and his yes man
hadn't come along...

41:00.440 --> 41:03.270
...we would've fit with Blake.
None of this would've haPPened.

41:03.570 --> 41:05.600
Once again. that's not my fault.

41:05.770 --> 41:07.370
l don't understand
his beef with me.

41:07.540 --> 41:10.510
-l've tried to be cool with him.
-Nick's got beef with everybody.

41:10.680 --> 41:13.310
-You just can't take it Personally.
-Yeah. l guess.

41:13.480 --> 41:17.210
Nick and l always used to stick together.
and then when we were in junior high...

41:17.390 --> 41:21.520
...and Nick would get into trouble here and
there and our Parents would always. like...

41:21.690 --> 41:23.850
...comPare us. l was the good twin...

41:24.030 --> 41:26.790
...and Nick was the evil twin.
as he likes to say.

41:27.200 --> 41:28.890
He kind of got this image.

41:29.060 --> 41:33.120
He totally Played it uP as if
that's what he had to be or something.

41:35.640 --> 41:38.610
lt's already getting dark.
l hate the winter.

41:38.770 --> 41:42.230
He's got everything but a 1 5-inch.

41:42.910 --> 41:45.210
l'll just have to use a 1 6-inch.

41:45.580 --> 41:48.610
-Make it work somehow.
-You Plan on stealing that?

41:50.020 --> 41:52.540
No. We didn't know how much longer
you were gonna be...

41:52.720 --> 41:55.120
...and. you know. we didn't
wanna interruPt again.

41:55.290 --> 41:58.520
l left you money on the counter.
but you don't have the right size.

41:58.690 --> 42:01.250
-You don't have any 1 5-inches.
-l do at the house.

42:01.430 --> 42:04.230
l hoPe you're not getting
the wrong idea that we're in here.

42:04.400 --> 42:05.960
No. it's okay.

42:08.070 --> 42:10.200
-Does that cover it?
-lt's close enough.

42:10.370 --> 42:13.340
Why don't we get the one you need?
lt's only a couPle of blocks.

42:13.510 --> 42:15.980
-Yeah. all right.
-You keeP fan belts at your house?

42:16.210 --> 42:18.340
l get things delivered there
when l'm not here.

42:18.510 --> 42:20.980
lf you wanna hold on to the 1 6.
that's fine by me.

42:21.150 --> 42:23.170
No. no. no. lt's okay.

42:25.690 --> 42:27.810
Hey. you mind if l use
your restroom real fast?

42:27.990 --> 42:30.010
Oh. uP at the house.
That one's out of order.

42:30.190 --> 42:31.720
All right.

42:35.430 --> 42:39.090
So is it too late to sign Carly uP
for that beauty Pageant?

42:39.500 --> 42:43.460
Now. unfortunately it is. because
you would've won hands down.

42:43.710 --> 42:45.900
-Thank you.
-That house of wax is Pretty cool.

42:46.070 --> 42:47.600
-You went inside?
-Yeah.

42:47.780 --> 42:49.830
Yeah. it was unlocked.
so. you know....

42:50.350 --> 42:53.470
Everything seems to be unlocked
around you. now don't it?

42:55.350 --> 42:58.150
Yeah. PeoPle used to come to see it
from miles away.

42:58.320 --> 43:02.220
And Trudy was the main....
l guess ''artist'' is the aPProPriate word.

43:02.390 --> 43:04.220
What about Vincent?

43:04.960 --> 43:08.790
-l saw his name on a lot of the work.
-He was one of Trudy's boys.

43:08.960 --> 43:11.660
-They still around?
-No. no. lt's a horrible story.

43:11.830 --> 43:14.830
Trudy's husband. Doc Sinclair.
he was a doctor in the big city...

43:15.000 --> 43:18.130
...until he got his license revoked
for doing surgeries on the side.

43:18.310 --> 43:21.040
Stuff that. you know.
most doctors wouldn't dare do.

43:21.210 --> 43:24.080
So he moved him and Trudy
out here to Ambrose...

43:24.410 --> 43:26.880
...made a fresh start
with his medical Practice...

43:27.050 --> 43:31.180
...and. you know. Trudy really found her
calling with that whole wax-sculPture thing.

43:31.450 --> 43:34.550
lt was her dream to do something
really incredible here.

43:34.720 --> 43:36.750
And then she had a couPle kids.
Picket fence.

43:36.920 --> 43:38.590
-What's horrible about that?
-Yeah.

43:38.760 --> 43:42.030
Trudy got a cyst in her brain.
She just started rotting away.

43:42.200 --> 43:44.530
Couldn't work no more.
and she went crazy.

43:44.700 --> 43:48.030
Things got so bad that Doc Sinclair
finally had to straP her to the bed.

43:48.200 --> 43:50.570
The whole town
could hear her screaming.

43:51.010 --> 43:54.240
Dr. Sinclair was so dePressed
that he couldn't save her...

43:54.410 --> 43:57.070
-...he blew his head right off.
-That's terrible.

43:57.250 --> 43:59.440
lt was worse for the boys.
left alone like that.

43:59.610 --> 44:02.340
They both ended uP in foster homes.

44:03.850 --> 44:05.250
Hey. why don't you two hoP in.

44:05.420 --> 44:08.410
l'll go get the fan belt.

44:08.590 --> 44:12.030

us uP where the road's washed out.

44:12.190 --> 44:15.190

44:15.360 --> 44:16.690
-Cool.
-All right.

44:17.430 --> 44:21.300
-Hey. you need to use the facilities. right?
-Yeah. Thanks.

44:22.800 --> 44:25.200
-Need to use the can?
-No. it's okay. l'm fine.

44:25.370 --> 44:27.170
All right.

44:37.050 --> 44:40.490
-So where you heading to anyway?
-We're just going to a football game.

44:41.590 --> 44:43.650
The bathroom is right down the hall.

44:43.830 --> 44:46.990
Let me get out of this jacket and tie.

45:28.540 --> 45:30.700
Whatever. You didn't
have to cover for me. dude.

45:30.870 --> 45:34.310
Your jacket's clean. all right?
Mine's already got Plenty of stains on it.

45:34.480 --> 45:36.840
One more's not gonna make a difference.

45:40.820 --> 45:43.940
Where the hell is this Place?
Town's not even on the GPS.

01:09:56.510 --> 01:09:58.910
-What if he turns him to wax?
-What do you mean. wax?

01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:02.780
You don't get it.
They're all wax. everyone.

01:10:05.020 --> 01:10:06.490
No. wait.

01:10:08.730 --> 01:10:10.750
There was a woman in here.

01:10:11.130 --> 01:10:13.620
She was alive.
She Pulled the curtain back.

01:10:39.090 --> 01:10:41.180
The whole town is rigged.

01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:42.880
That's imPossible.

01:10:49.270 --> 01:10:52.060
You're saying that

01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:54.870

-Yes.

01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:56.840
At the church. they were all like that.

Guys, where the hell are you?

01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:54.280
Remember the truck that came
to the campsite last night?

01:12:54.460 --> 01:12:56.320
I think we just ran into him.

01:12:56.990 --> 01:13:00.120
-Where's Wade?
-He's still in the bathroom, then.

01:13:00.300 --> 01:13:02.700

-Waiting for Wade.

01:13:02.870 --> 01:13:04.890
This is my truck.

-He said he had a brother. right?
-Yeah.

01:17:57.460 --> 01:17:58.930
Vincent.

01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:01.800
At the house of wax.
he did all the sculPtures.

01:18:01.960 --> 01:18:04.690
He's gotta be the one
that does the wax.

01:18:04.870 --> 01:18:06.960
-What if he's around here somewhere?
-Yeah.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:09.230
Wait.

01:18:10.510 --> 01:18:13.810

You gotta be careful.

l am being careful.

01:18:23.790 --> 01:18:26.410
No. no. no. lt'll make too much noise.

01:18:26.590 --> 01:18:29.320
Why do you have to be
so damn stubborn? He will find us.

01:18:29.490 --> 01:18:31.260
Yeah. chances are he will anyway.

01:18:31.430 --> 01:18:33.620
At least with this.
he might not wanna find us.

01:18:39.540 --> 01:18:41.060
That's about right.

01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:53.310
Go. Carly. Run!

01:21:57.170 --> 01:21:59.360
EmPty shells.

01:22:02.170 --> 01:22:03.900
Check him for ammo.

There's nothing in his Pockets.

01:22:53.790 --> 01:22:57.320
Look. what about Wade and Dalton?

01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:05.520
Wade went in there and never came out.

01:24:07.660 --> 01:24:09.150

01:43:04.530 --> 01:43:05.930
Faster! Faster!

01:43:10.810 --> 01:43:12.330
Dig!

01:43:13.040 --> 01:43:15.840
Come on. Carly. Faster!

01:43:18.480 --> 01:43:21.640
Go. go! Come on. Come on.

01:43:33.660 --> 01:43:35.060
Oh. God!

01:44:35.520 --> 01:44:37.390
Watch yourself.

01:44:38.430 --> 01:44:40.860
lt's over 70 and counting right now.

01:44:50.640 --> 01:44:52.770
Hey. that's my friend's camera.

01:44:53.140 --> 01:44:55.300
Hey. that's my friend's camera.

01:44:55.480 --> 01:44:57.880
Sorry. son. That's evidence.

01:44:58.810 --> 01:45:00.780
You guys okay?

01:45:02.120 --> 01:45:04.450
Well. don't worry.
We'll get you to the hosPital.

01:45:04.820 --> 01:45:06.910
How could no one have known
about all of this?

01:45:07.520 --> 01:45:10.390
Truth is. this town's hard as hell
to get to.

01:45:10.560 --> 01:45:13.960
lt's been abandoned 1 0 years.
ever since that sugar mill shut down.

01:45:14.130 --> 01:45:16.120
Hell. it ain't even
on the maP anymore.

01:45:16.400 --> 01:45:18.460
We found all those cars
in that old factory.

01:45:18.630 --> 01:45:21.600
Those Sinclair boys Pulled PeoPle
off the interstate for years.

01:45:21.770 --> 01:45:26.830
lf it wasn't for all the smoke from
the fire. we wouldn't have even known.

01:45:27.680 --> 01:45:29.840
Excuse me. sir.
Louis wants to talk to you.

01:45:30.010 --> 01:45:32.040
Yeah. Excuse me.

01:45:59.770 --> 01:46:02.270
Maybe there's some good memories
on this.

01:46:03.080 --> 01:46:04.370
You took it?

01:46:04.780 --> 01:46:07.510
lt just felt wrong leaving it behind.

01:46:07.680 --> 01:46:09.150
You know?

01:46:09.720 --> 01:46:11.480
You okay?

01:46:13.120 --> 01:46:14.920
We're okay.

01:46:16.860 --> 01:46:18.690
Sheriff?

01:46:19.190 --> 01:46:23.290
-Yeah. Dave?
-Ran the Sinclair family through CDIC.

01:46:23.460 --> 01:46:25.660
Trudy and the doctor didn't
have two sons.

01:46:26.230 --> 01:46:27.860
They had three.
