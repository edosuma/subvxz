[classical music playing]

00:13.347 --> 00:15.224
[Muffy] Everything we do is
on the off chance

00:15.307 --> 00:16.808
it'll help us get laid by a guy

00:16.892 --> 00:19.061
who might make one
of us first fucking lady someday

00:19.144 --> 00:20.812
so we actually have a shot
at leaving our mark

00:20.896 --> 00:22.689
on this ass-backwards, patriarchal,

00:22.773 --> 00:24.775
corporate republic we call a country.

00:24.858 --> 00:26.235
Pull it together, Muffy.

00:26.318 --> 00:28.820
-[Muffy] Okay.
-[man] Hey, you. [chuckles]

00:28.904 --> 00:31.156
Mm.

00:31.240 --> 00:34.284
[narrator] <i>It's been said</i>
<i>that behind every great man</i>

00:34.368 --> 00:35.994
<i>is a great woman.</i>

00:36.078 --> 00:39.623
<i>It's been said so often,</i>
<i>Coco actually believed it.</i>

00:41.708 --> 00:44.294
<i>In fact, there was no version of her plan</i>

00:44.378 --> 00:46.463
<i>that didn't involve a great man.</i>

00:46.547 --> 00:49.800
I came across your prep school yearbook.
Thought you might like to have it.

00:49.883 --> 00:52.427
[narrator] <i>One such man</i>
<i>was Leonard McCullen,</i>

00:52.511 --> 00:54.721
<i>a noted philanthropist</i>
<i>who plucked a brilliant</i>

00:54.805 --> 00:56.348
<i>but understimulated Coco</i>

00:56.431 --> 00:58.350
<i>from Chicago's inner-city schools,</i>

01:03.605 --> 01:06.233
[Coco] Life plan?
I forgot I even did this.

01:06.316 --> 01:08.026
Thinking about law schools yet?

01:09.278 --> 01:11.071
What are you waiting for?

01:14.533 --> 01:15.742
I had a good time with you.

01:15.826 --> 01:17.202
Me too.

01:17.286 --> 01:20.289
So what are you looking for?

01:21.540 --> 01:24.626
I mean, I don't really believe in looking,
you know?

01:24.710 --> 01:25.585
I'd just like to...

01:25.669 --> 01:29.047
[narrator] <i>Yeah, yeah. Of course,</i>
<i>Coco knew this was white boy for...</i>

01:29.131 --> 01:30.674
You and I both know I could never
bring you home

01:30.757 --> 01:32.843
to my parents, but I'd love to hook up,

01:32.926 --> 01:34.970
so I could tell my buddies what it was
like to taste your dark chocolate,

01:35.053 --> 01:38.557
-you know what I'm saying?
-Sounds good, Todd. Call you.

01:39.641 --> 01:40.767
[narrator] <i>It was times like these</i>

01:40.851 --> 01:43.103
<i>Coco seriously questioned</i>
<i>why her dating pool</i>

01:43.186 --> 01:45.856
<i>resembled the audience</i>
<i>at a John Mayer concert.</i>

01:45.939 --> 01:48.317
-[Coco] Sorry I'm late.
-We just finished.

01:48.400 --> 01:49.651
It's hard having a budget meeting

01:49.735 --> 01:51.653
-without our treasurer.
-Calm down, James.

01:51.737 --> 01:54.031
You'll have the whole night
to jerk off to Sean Hannity.

01:54.114 --> 01:55.741
We have a deadline for this budget, Co.

01:55.824 --> 01:58.201
Well, what are you doing later?

01:58.285 --> 02:01.121
[Coco] <i>If we consolidate these two events,</i>

02:01.204 --> 02:02.998
we could end up with a surplus.

02:03.957 --> 02:04.791
Mm-hmm.

02:04.875 --> 02:06.543
[narrator] <i>Despite his short</i>
<i>attention span,</i>

02:06.627 --> 02:09.796
<i>paltry GPA and the fact that</i>
<i>he rejected her freshman year,</i>

02:09.880 --> 02:11.965
<i>Troy was a legacy kid who had the access</i>

02:12.049 --> 02:14.843
<i>a girl like Coco could really get behind.</i>

02:14.926 --> 02:16.803
See something you like?

02:23.935 --> 02:24.978
[narrator] <i>In other words,</i>

02:25.062 --> 02:29.191
<i>Troy had what it took to check her box.</i>

02:45.540 --> 02:47.959
Who do you think you are,
you traitorous motherfucker?

02:48.043 --> 02:49.628
That's not rhetorical.

02:49.711 --> 02:52.047
You made Troy look like
a drunk overwhelmed boy.

02:52.130 --> 02:54.716
-So you saw the article.
-Are you trying to be funny?

02:55.342 --> 02:57.052
Look, can we not do this
in front of people?

02:57.135 --> 02:58.929
You didn't keep your article to yourself.

02:59.012 --> 03:01.223
I'm not keeping my opinion to myself.

03:01.306 --> 03:02.974
Look, I didn't do it to betray him, okay?

03:03.058 --> 03:05.060
People needed to see
that even someone like Troy

03:05.143 --> 03:07.187
and a kid like Reggie are one
and the same.

03:07.270 --> 03:09.523
And the fact that you would
air his dirty laundry and betray him--

03:09.606 --> 03:10.857
I didn't betray him.

03:10.941 --> 03:12.859
Look, Coco, he told me a lot more.

03:12.943 --> 03:14.986
I could have written a lot more.

03:16.571 --> 03:17.531
Like what?

03:18.240 --> 03:19.866
Look, I don't feel like it's right for me

03:19.950 --> 03:23.078
-to divulge Troy's personal business.
-What's going on?

03:24.037 --> 03:26.039
I was just here enjoying the pan sausage,

03:26.123 --> 03:29.501
and Coco was here and loud, scary.

03:29.584 --> 03:32.170
He wasn't talking to you.
What the hell is wrong with you?

03:32.754 --> 03:35.090
Why would you say these things?
What were you thinking?

03:35.173 --> 03:36.675
None of these questions are rhetorical.

03:36.758 --> 03:40.470
Coco, I was just answering a few questions
that Lionel had for me.

03:40.554 --> 03:43.598
You want to run away
and never speak to him again?

03:43.682 --> 03:45.517
He's the dean and your father.

03:45.600 --> 03:47.519
This is not how you work the press.

03:47.602 --> 03:50.522
No one needs to know that your daddy
didn't wish you happy birthday.

03:50.605 --> 03:52.190
You need to calm down.

03:52.274 --> 03:53.442
No, you need to calm down.

03:55.235 --> 03:56.153
Wait.

03:56.236 --> 03:57.529
Why <i>are</i> you so calm?

03:57.612 --> 03:59.865
I just came from seeing my dad.

03:59.948 --> 04:01.783
Look, I thought he was
gonna give me a lecture,

04:01.867 --> 04:04.077
and instead, he gave me this watch.

04:04.161 --> 04:05.495
So...

04:06.580 --> 04:07.581
we good?

04:07.664 --> 04:08.623
Oh, no, we gonna talk.

04:08.707 --> 04:11.334
But, yeah, you can go off
and finish your pan sausage.

04:16.089 --> 04:17.883
[sighs] So what happened?

04:17.966 --> 04:19.718
[sighs] It was really weird.

04:19.801 --> 04:23.096
He had actually read the article
and was all nice about it.

04:23.180 --> 04:25.015
He even insinuated he loves me.

04:25.098 --> 04:29.186
Then he invited me to some big donor thing
because he wants me to get more involved.

04:29.269 --> 04:30.520
And less like a puppet.

04:30.604 --> 04:33.148
Wow. How long you been sitting
on that one?

04:33.231 --> 04:34.357
-Hmm.
-And to think

04:34.441 --> 04:35.567
I was going to invite you.

04:35.650 --> 04:37.778
Oh, that's so cute.
You think you have a choice.

04:37.861 --> 04:40.280
Yeah, you won't believe where we're going.

04:40.363 --> 04:41.531
[Coco] The Hancocks?

04:41.615 --> 04:43.366
Students don't get to meet the Hancocks.

04:43.450 --> 04:45.577
This is the inner, inner circle.

04:45.660 --> 04:48.246
We'll be involved in the biggest decisions
at Winchester.

04:48.330 --> 04:49.956
I have some initial thoughts.

04:50.040 --> 04:52.375
Then next year,
I'll become student body president.

04:52.459 --> 04:55.420
You'll move up to student chair
on the board of trustees.

04:55.504 --> 04:58.799
And when we graduate,
we'll have our pick of law schools.

04:58.882 --> 05:00.509
We'll both go to Columbia, of course,

05:00.592 --> 05:02.219
because we have to live in New York,

05:02.302 --> 05:03.637
and NYU is a joke.

05:03.720 --> 05:05.514
<i>Ooh, and when we're in Washington,</i>

05:05.597 --> 05:09.017
you'll work on the Hill,
and I'll be a hotshot lobbyist.

05:09.100 --> 05:11.311
-Mm.
-Ooh.

05:11.394 --> 05:12.354
Mm.

05:12.437 --> 05:15.232
I wonder if that's a conflict of interest.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.108
I'll do some research.

05:17.192 --> 05:19.069
And eventually the White House.

05:19.152 --> 05:20.445
-Or I'll run.
-Ooh.

05:20.529 --> 05:22.447
No, you first.

05:22.531 --> 05:26.827
At the inauguration,
Jason Wu will design a gown so regal

05:26.910 --> 05:28.662
that when Kate Middleton sees it,

05:28.745 --> 05:30.247
she's gonna shit her britches.

05:30.330 --> 05:31.623
[Troy moans]

05:31.706 --> 05:33.333
[Coco] How do you feel about kids?

05:33.416 --> 05:35.293
Hypothetically.

05:35.377 --> 05:39.172
I'm thinking a girl and a boy,
three years apart,

05:39.256 --> 05:41.341
Penelope and Prescott.

05:42.008 --> 05:44.553
Hypothetically. I'm on the pill.

05:44.636 --> 05:45.720
[both moaning]

05:45.804 --> 05:47.055
-Oh!
-[Coco screams]

05:47.138 --> 05:49.599
-[Coco] Oh, my God.
-Oh, shit.

05:50.267 --> 05:51.351
[Coco] I need you to leave.

05:51.434 --> 05:52.561
Now.

05:52.644 --> 05:54.312
Coco, I don't care about the wig.

05:54.396 --> 05:56.231
-What wig?
-[chuckles]

05:56.314 --> 05:58.316
-Coco...
-[whimpers]

05:59.317 --> 06:01.236
Colandrea.

06:02.320 --> 06:05.532
The hair is great,
but I have always dug the girl wearing it.

06:10.871 --> 06:12.914
Keep going. You're on the right track.

06:15.417 --> 06:16.668
[Troy sighs]

06:22.465 --> 06:23.550
Better?

06:28.597 --> 06:30.557
There she is.

06:30.640 --> 06:33.852
Look, you know you'd still be fine as hell
with no hair at all.

06:34.561 --> 06:36.771
I mean, don't get, like,
a baldy or anything.

06:36.855 --> 06:37.856
[Coco chuckles]

06:37.939 --> 06:40.233
[chattering]

06:42.652 --> 06:43.820
Coco.

06:47.574 --> 06:48.950
Wow.

06:58.043 --> 06:59.586
Thank you.

07:02.839 --> 07:04.466
[Coco chuckles softly]

07:04.549 --> 07:06.926
[laughing]

07:07.010 --> 07:09.262
[woman] <i>The thing about</i>
<i>Keynesian economics is,</i>

07:09.346 --> 07:12.015
you either end a recession,
or you lose a few pounds.

07:12.098 --> 07:13.224
[laughing]

07:13.308 --> 07:15.477
Of course, the only recession
Eva cares about

07:15.560 --> 07:16.895
is my hairline.

07:16.978 --> 07:18.813
[laughing]

07:18.897 --> 07:20.857
Laughing at dumb rich people
jokes is terrible.

07:20.941 --> 07:24.069
Laughing at dumb rich people
jokes is lucrative.

07:24.152 --> 07:26.029
Listen to her, Troy, and you'll go far.

07:26.112 --> 07:27.614
How are you, my friend?

07:27.697 --> 07:30.075
Look who I found wandering
around in the hall.

07:30.158 --> 07:31.701
-Hello.
-Oh, my goodness.

07:31.785 --> 07:32.786
[both laugh]

07:32.869 --> 07:35.455
Douglas, Eva,
please say hello to Professor Hobbs.

07:35.538 --> 07:36.790
-Hello.
-[Douglas] Welcome.

07:36.873 --> 07:39.626
Thank you. Hello, Troy.

07:39.709 --> 07:41.127
Doesn't that look delicious?

07:41.211 --> 07:43.046
Can you show me where you found those?

07:43.129 --> 07:44.798
You know I love a blackberry.

07:44.881 --> 07:47.300
Of course. Follow me.

07:47.384 --> 07:49.094
I'll be right back.

07:53.807 --> 07:56.226
[Neika] Monique and I have set
a wedding date.

07:56.309 --> 07:58.770
-[Troy] Really?
-[Neika] Really.

07:59.396 --> 08:00.605
[Troy] You're going through with this?

08:00.689 --> 08:03.274
Troy, this is what a grown-up
relationship looks like.

08:03.358 --> 08:05.443
Ooh, secrets, secrets are no fun.

08:05.527 --> 08:07.779
Secrets, secrets hurt someone.

08:07.862 --> 08:09.114
[women laugh]

08:09.197 --> 08:11.366
Well, I was just telling Troy
about my wedding plans.

08:11.449 --> 08:14.619
My fiancée Monique wants
a destination wedding in Hawaii.

08:14.703 --> 08:17.122
Ooh, Hawaii. Exotic.

08:17.205 --> 08:19.040
And far from here.

08:20.417 --> 08:21.960
Bye, kids.

08:24.129 --> 08:26.339
A one-percent uptick in admissions rate,

08:26.423 --> 08:27.966
and the board is up in arms,

08:28.049 --> 08:30.635
and I thought that the rich
loved the one percent.

08:30.719 --> 08:32.595
-[laughing]
-What do you think, Troy?

08:33.972 --> 08:36.391
I... [clears throat]

08:36.474 --> 08:38.101
I think it's good.

08:38.184 --> 08:39.686
In fact, while we're at it,

08:39.769 --> 08:41.604
I think we should look
at prospective students

08:41.688 --> 08:44.524
with more community service experience,

08:44.607 --> 08:47.068
and everyone benefits
from smart, passionate

08:47.152 --> 08:48.778
young people volunteering.

08:48.862 --> 08:52.490
And the best part of Troy's idea--
and he has a lot of good ones--

08:52.574 --> 08:56.536
is that you'll get more applicants.
You'll admit the same number of them,

08:56.619 --> 08:59.706
and the acceptance rate goes down,
and that's something to brag about.

08:59.789 --> 09:01.416
And I do enjoy bragging.

09:01.499 --> 09:03.668
[Coco] My mentor Leonard McCullen

09:03.752 --> 09:06.421
always says don't deny the world
the truth about yourself

09:06.504 --> 09:07.964
just because it's good.

09:08.048 --> 09:10.717
I had no idea that you were one
of the McCullen Scholars.

09:10.800 --> 09:13.762
He always had a keen eye
for talented youth.

09:13.845 --> 09:15.722
Yes, he is very generous.

09:15.805 --> 09:17.348
We've always been generous in the past,

09:17.432 --> 09:20.643
but given what's been happening
on campus lately,

09:20.727 --> 09:22.604
first that god-awful party...

09:22.687 --> 09:24.981
[Douglas] Then that officer
pulling the gun on the student.

09:25.065 --> 09:26.149
It was truly terrible.

09:26.232 --> 09:30.361
That's why you're gonna be happy
to hear that Troy is leading a town hall

09:30.445 --> 09:33.114
for students to express their grievances.

09:33.198 --> 09:35.283
Yes, I think an open forum
helps quell tension.

09:35.366 --> 09:36.951
[Fletcher] Exactly.

09:37.035 --> 09:40.622
In a few months, everyone's gonna be
joining hands and singing "Kumbaya."

09:40.705 --> 09:42.373
-[laughing]
-[Eva] Really?

09:42.457 --> 09:43.666
Because from what we've heard,

09:43.750 --> 09:46.753
some students are planning
to protest your town hall.

09:46.836 --> 09:50.048
It wouldn't be a college
without a student protest.

09:50.131 --> 09:51.216
You remember those days.

09:51.299 --> 09:54.552
But aren't you worried about the attention
of the national press?

09:54.636 --> 09:56.387
You know why this is happening.

09:56.471 --> 09:58.264
Self-segregation.

09:58.348 --> 10:00.183
[Fairbanks] Now, Eva,
I was head of A-P House

10:00.266 --> 10:02.852
when I was Troy's age,
and I can assure you,

10:02.936 --> 10:04.938
it is a wonderful tradition.

10:05.021 --> 10:07.398
Allowing dorms to take
their natural demographic shape

10:07.482 --> 10:10.902
gives students a pride
in creating their own enclaves,

10:10.985 --> 10:12.821
a safe space, if you will.

10:12.904 --> 10:16.407
And it can reduce the feeling
of otherness at Winchester.

10:16.491 --> 10:18.159
Eva and I believe that having students

10:18.243 --> 10:20.286
of different backgrounds intermingle

10:20.370 --> 10:23.081
creates an exchange of cultural ideas.

10:23.164 --> 10:25.250
I never would have thought
of opening a charter school

10:25.333 --> 10:28.545
in Africa if it weren't
for my law school roommate Fahim.

10:28.628 --> 10:31.422
Oh, you opened an African charter school?

10:31.506 --> 10:32.757
We're still looking at the numbers.

10:32.841 --> 10:34.801
Well, I think we can consider

10:34.884 --> 10:37.554
changing housing policies in the future,

10:37.637 --> 10:39.222
but for right now--

10:39.305 --> 10:41.975
Surely, our generosity
buys some consideration.

10:43.143 --> 10:44.936
Oh, port, anyone?

10:48.273 --> 10:50.108
I think that went really well.

10:50.191 --> 10:53.444
Troy, this is not
what going well looks like.

10:53.528 --> 10:55.155
These people are talking about pulling

10:55.238 --> 10:57.490
their ten-million-dollar donation.

10:57.574 --> 10:58.950
I didn't hear them say that.

10:59.033 --> 11:01.411
Trust me, I'm fluent in WASP.

11:01.494 --> 11:03.580
[Neika] Actually, she's right.

11:04.706 --> 11:06.249
Why do you think you're here?

11:06.332 --> 11:07.876
Because after that article,

11:07.959 --> 11:10.753
my father wants to prove he loves
and respects me

11:10.837 --> 11:13.047
and that he's trying
to make things better between us.

11:14.841 --> 11:15.925
No, that's not it.

11:16.009 --> 11:19.596
You're here to show that not all black
students want to burn this place down.

11:19.679 --> 11:20.930
You're props.

11:21.014 --> 11:23.141
-Of course we are.
-[Troy sighs]

11:23.224 --> 11:26.936
If integrating A-P is the only thing
in the way of this school

11:27.020 --> 11:29.480
and the support of its largest donors,

11:29.564 --> 11:31.774
what do you think is gonna happen?

11:35.778 --> 11:37.906
Can we please just stop
talking about this already?

11:37.989 --> 11:40.783
I'm telling you, this is your opportunity

11:40.867 --> 11:44.704
to ingratiate yourself
to some very influential people.

11:44.787 --> 11:47.165
The Hancocks have a problem.

11:47.248 --> 11:49.208
If you can be the one to solve it,

11:49.292 --> 11:51.294
think of what they can do for you.

11:51.377 --> 11:52.754
I don't know.

11:52.837 --> 11:54.964
This is your chance to make your mark.

11:55.048 --> 11:57.383
You need to get Sam to cancel the protest.

11:57.467 --> 11:59.802
Sam won't listen to me. She never has.

11:59.886 --> 12:01.471
Well, then make her.

12:01.554 --> 12:02.430
How?

12:04.390 --> 12:06.309
You can be very persuasive.

12:06.392 --> 12:09.103
[chuckles] I mean, you did manage

12:09.187 --> 12:12.607
to convince a professor
to have an affair with you.

12:18.529 --> 12:19.781
How did you know?

12:21.157 --> 12:22.867
You just told me.

12:23.660 --> 12:25.536
Excuse me.

12:31.084 --> 12:32.126

12:44.639 --> 12:45.974
I should go.

12:46.057 --> 12:47.183
I'm gonna go. I'll go.

12:47.266 --> 12:48.810
[Coco] No, it's fine.

12:48.893 --> 12:51.562
I'm the one fucking crying
in your bathroom.

12:53.231 --> 12:54.983
Now I know what you didn't put
in the article.

12:55.066 --> 12:58.653
Oh, huh, he told you about the pee stuff?

12:58.736 --> 12:59.779
Pee stuff?

12:59.862 --> 13:01.114
-No.
-Neika.

13:01.197 --> 13:02.657
Obviously, about the Neika stuff.

13:02.740 --> 13:05.201
Yep, that makes way more sense.

13:05.868 --> 13:06.911
I'll give you a minute.

13:08.204 --> 13:09.414
[Coco] Lionel.

13:11.582 --> 13:13.876
It's not as good as you think it is.

13:15.461 --> 13:16.546
What?

13:16.629 --> 13:18.214
Being with him.

13:19.882 --> 13:21.342
Yeah.

14:20.985 --> 14:24.447
I mean, I love it, but do you need money?

14:25.490 --> 14:26.741
Are you high?

14:26.824 --> 14:29.410
Not since your peace offering.

14:30.203 --> 14:33.664
No, it's been a while
since you and I sat around

14:33.748 --> 14:35.416
and talked.

14:37.627 --> 14:39.045
Yeah.

14:39.128 --> 14:41.005
We used to talk some shit.

14:42.423 --> 14:43.424
I got to hand it to you,

14:43.508 --> 14:45.635
at least your shit-talking
is changing the world.

14:45.718 --> 14:47.053
[Coco chuckles softly]

14:48.096 --> 14:48.971
What's going on?

14:50.348 --> 14:51.766
Nothing.

14:51.849 --> 14:53.810
Don't "nothing" me. I know you.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.728
Whenever you hit the kitchen like this,

14:55.812 --> 14:57.188
something's wrong.

What's going on with you and white bae?

15:05.947 --> 15:08.282
I really fucked things up.

15:12.703 --> 15:14.080
I don't want to talk about it.

15:14.163 --> 15:15.957
Okay, we could talk about something else.

15:16.040 --> 15:19.836
[Sam] Maybe I'm not supposed
to have a personal life.

15:19.919 --> 15:22.422
Maybe all of this is a sign
that I'm just supposed to focus

15:22.505 --> 15:24.048
on the important things.

15:24.132 --> 15:25.174
Like your protest?

15:26.467 --> 15:30.179
Sam, you don't have to be a slave
to the cause, you know.

15:31.264 --> 15:33.015
It's bigger than me, Co.

15:35.393 --> 15:37.562
If you really want to change things,

15:37.645 --> 15:39.355
don't protest the town hall.

15:40.481 --> 15:41.524
What are you talking about?

15:41.607 --> 15:45.278
There are some very influential people
who want to integrate A-P.

15:45.361 --> 15:47.238
This protest could send them
over the edge.

15:47.321 --> 15:49.490
Integrate A-P?

15:49.574 --> 15:51.075
I don't know who these people are

15:51.159 --> 15:53.286
or what edge they're on,
but they can jump the fuck off.

15:53.369 --> 15:57.331
Sam, they've pledged ten million dollars
to the university.

15:57.415 --> 15:59.792
That could go towards
recruiting students of color--

15:59.876 --> 16:01.669
Troy's got you drinking his Kool-Aid--

16:01.752 --> 16:03.796
or rather his daddy's Kool-Aid.

16:03.880 --> 16:06.424
So you came to give me a taste,
but guess what.

16:07.008 --> 16:08.259
I ain't thirsty, girl.

16:08.342 --> 16:10.303
Troy doesn't even know I'm here.

Really?

16:16.142 --> 16:18.561
Coco, what are you doing here?

16:18.644 --> 16:21.063
She's trying to convince me
to stop the protest,

16:21.147 --> 16:24.734
which you put her up to,
so don't act all surprised.

16:24.817 --> 16:25.776
Why would you do that?

16:25.860 --> 16:27.778
I figured you weren't going to do it.

16:27.862 --> 16:29.280
You're right, I wasn't.

16:29.363 --> 16:30.490
Thank you.

16:30.573 --> 16:32.867
So why are you here now?

16:34.160 --> 16:35.661
To ask you not to protest.

16:35.745 --> 16:37.914

16:37.997 --> 16:39.749
Wow!

You two are the fucking worst.

Next time, coordinate
your Uncle Tom-foolery

16:44.003 --> 16:45.379

16:45.463 --> 16:48.466
Sam, you're always trying to improve
the black experience at Winchester.

16:49.175 --> 16:51.719
How are you gonna feel when A-P's gone
and it's your fault?

16:51.802 --> 16:55.014
Troy, people have tried that before.

16:55.973 --> 16:58.142
It didn't happen then,
and it won't happen now...

16:59.143 --> 17:00.436

17:00.520 --> 17:02.021
Fine.

17:02.104 --> 17:03.397

you can't reason with her.

We?

17:47.733 --> 17:49.360
What the hell was that about?

17:49.443 --> 17:50.486
You tell me.

17:51.529 --> 17:52.905
You were badgering me
into doing something.

17:52.989 --> 17:55.992
Then I go do it and find you
there ahead of me doing it.

17:56.075 --> 17:57.660
You know I was just trying to help.

17:57.743 --> 18:01.247
Were you? Or did you think
I can't get anything done without you?

18:01.998 --> 18:04.250
Coco, what do you even like about me?

18:04.333 --> 18:06.127
And nothing about power or success

18:06.210 --> 18:07.753
and nothing physical or sexual.

18:07.837 --> 18:10.047
I mean, what is it about me as a person?

18:10.131 --> 18:12.091
What are you talking about?

18:15.469 --> 18:16.929
You don't like me.

18:18.556 --> 18:20.391
You like the idea of me.

18:22.560 --> 18:24.520
No, not even. You like the idea of us.

18:31.485 --> 18:33.195
Are you breaking up with me?

18:33.279 --> 18:35.323
I wasn't thinking of it
so much as a breakup,

18:35.406 --> 18:37.158
since we weren't really together.

18:38.784 --> 18:40.536
Are you fucking kidding me?

18:42.913 --> 18:44.290
We never said we were exclusive.

18:44.373 --> 18:47.043
