WEBVTT

00:02.103 --> 00:03.504
Previously on "Chance"...

00:03.537 --> 00:04.738
CHANCE: I'm trying
to give Jaclyn to you,

00:04.772 --> 00:06.140
trying to find a way
to let you keep helping her.

00:06.174 --> 00:08.509
Did her other therapist
go to this much trouble for her?

00:08.542 --> 00:11.145
-What was her name?
-Myra Cohen, I think.

00:11.179 --> 00:13.647
-She died?
-Yeah. Police said they thought

00:13.681 --> 00:16.484
she might have tried to stop
a home invasion robbery.

00:16.517 --> 00:17.818
You're my knight.

00:17.851 --> 00:19.520
Jackie said that, too.

00:19.553 --> 00:22.190
5 gets you his computer,
10 gets him a beating,

00:22.223 --> 00:23.591
20 makes him go away.

00:23.624 --> 00:25.693
All I want is something
that I can give the DA.

00:25.726 --> 00:27.095
You need
to give them something.

00:27.128 --> 00:29.197
Otherwise it's your word
against Blackstone's.

00:29.230 --> 00:31.932
You don't want that.
Jaclyn said he's dirty.

00:31.965 --> 00:33.734
Point is,
we get to know him,

00:33.767 --> 00:35.736
so we're there
when he trips over his dick.

00:35.769 --> 00:37.705
CHANCE: I almost
got us caught today.

00:38.772 --> 00:40.741
She's your
frozen lake, bro.

00:40.774 --> 00:42.443
Doc, I know you called
a time-out,

00:42.476 --> 00:44.212
but you needed to see.

00:44.245 --> 00:47.381
Your lady,
she was telling the truth.

00:47.415 --> 00:49.016
What's he doing?

00:49.049 --> 00:50.918
Trafficking women.

00:52.920 --> 00:55.923
**

01:51.845 --> 01:53.814
CHANCE:
How is that not enough?

01:53.847 --> 01:56.750
Call the cops right now.

01:56.784 --> 01:58.552
He's leaving.

02:00.120 --> 02:04.158
Okay, well,
so, we follow him,

02:04.192 --> 02:05.693
call the cops
on the way.

02:05.726 --> 02:08.196
Follow him in what car?
Yours?

02:08.229 --> 02:09.997
There was no time
to get a rental.

02:10.030 --> 02:12.366
-You said, "Come right now."
-Glad you did?

02:12.400 --> 02:13.801
We got to jump on this
right now.

02:13.834 --> 02:15.369
Take a breath, Doc.

02:15.403 --> 02:17.505
This isn't the ending.
This is where we start.

02:17.538 --> 02:18.906
What the hell
does that mean?

02:20.374 --> 02:22.210
When and if the cops
do roll up --

02:22.243 --> 02:24.378
(glass shatters)
And this is Ghost Town,

02:24.412 --> 02:26.714
what the dealers call
this part of Oakland --

02:26.747 --> 02:28.682
I can't imagine they'll
be in much of a hurry.

02:28.716 --> 02:30.551
But let's say
they do show.

02:30.584 --> 02:32.052
Drugs get flushed,

02:32.085 --> 02:33.987
girls are too scared
to talk,

02:34.021 --> 02:35.523
looks like a party.

02:35.556 --> 02:38.392
Blackstone catches wind of that,
and he backs off.

02:38.426 --> 02:40.828
(indistinct shouting)

02:43.030 --> 02:44.698
How'd you even know
about that building?

02:44.732 --> 02:48.369
Been having Carl drop me off
nights the past week.

02:48.402 --> 02:50.170
Best way to see
who's who in the zoo --

02:50.204 --> 02:52.306
get homeless
and talk to your neighbor.

02:52.340 --> 02:55.343
Took time,
but it paid off.

02:55.376 --> 02:58.846
You've been pretending
to be homeless every night?

02:58.879 --> 03:01.582
Good exercise.
More ways than one.

03:01.615 --> 03:03.183
People see
some homeless guy,

03:03.217 --> 03:06.320
say, "He seems okay.
He could work.

03:06.354 --> 03:08.188
What the fuck's
wrong with him?"

03:08.222 --> 03:11.058
Spend a week on the street,
you'll know what.

03:11.091 --> 03:13.827
Everyone should be homeless
for at least a month.

03:13.861 --> 03:16.063
I appreciate this,

03:16.096 --> 03:20.200
that you would
do this for me.

03:20.234 --> 03:22.035
You hired me, brother.

03:22.069 --> 03:24.071
24/7's how I roll.

03:24.104 --> 03:26.274
(car horns honking)

03:26.307 --> 03:28.642
But a shower and a burger
would be awesome.

03:30.778 --> 03:33.113
D: The orange lines are
where we followed Blackstone.

03:33.146 --> 03:34.415
The pins are
points of interest.

03:34.448 --> 03:37.184
Dog park,
Blackstone's condo,

03:37.217 --> 03:39.587
Happy Hands Spa,
and the warehouse.

03:39.620 --> 03:42.256
The eight green pins
are all massage parlors,

03:42.290 --> 03:45.225
now shut down in Blackstone's
big sting bust.

03:45.259 --> 03:47.761
Nailed a murder suspect
while he was at it, too --

03:47.795 --> 03:49.397
one of the bouncers.

03:49.430 --> 03:51.732
It's in the paper.
Man's a goddamn hero.

03:51.765 --> 03:53.534
Yeah. Terrific.

03:53.567 --> 03:57.305
Well, he was also raiding
the pantry, like we saw,

03:57.338 --> 03:59.373
making the sting
do double duty,

03:59.407 --> 04:01.309
using it for glory
in his day job

04:01.342 --> 04:03.143
and also to shut down
the competition,

04:03.176 --> 04:05.479
take the best girls
to beef up his own shop.

04:05.513 --> 04:07.381
We got to document that.
We got to get proof,

04:07.415 --> 04:09.116
something solid that --

04:09.149 --> 04:11.251
so it's not his word
against ours, like you said.

04:11.285 --> 04:13.487
Yeah, well,
he's running a business,

04:13.521 --> 04:15.389
so there's got to be
data somewhere.

04:15.423 --> 04:16.990
Laptop would be my guess.

04:17.024 --> 04:19.259
That, or some kind
of device, anyway,

04:19.293 --> 04:22.262
something that he wouldn't risk
going anywhere without.

04:22.296 --> 04:24.064
Crown Vic's an easy car
to break into.

04:24.097 --> 04:25.733
Pop the taillight
with a screwdriver

04:25.766 --> 04:27.134
gets you access
to the trunk.

04:27.167 --> 04:28.769
Hand drill gets you
into the back seat.

04:28.802 --> 04:31.939
Take a thumb drive, download
whatever files he's got --

04:31.972 --> 04:35.309
records, money transfers,
pictures, videos.

04:35.343 --> 04:36.577
Worth a shot.

04:36.610 --> 04:39.079
When?
When do we do this?

04:39.112 --> 04:41.949
Say, tomorrow night?

04:41.982 --> 04:43.751
Good.

04:43.784 --> 04:46.854
Then whatever we get
we give to newspapers.

04:46.887 --> 04:49.923
Send reporters
an anonymous gift.

04:49.957 --> 04:51.792
Maybe.

04:51.825 --> 04:52.826
That doesn't work,

04:52.860 --> 04:55.696
we can always
reconsider plan "A."

04:55.729 --> 04:57.765
Hide in that alley,
cut his throat.

04:57.798 --> 04:58.799
Problem solved.

04:58.832 --> 05:02.002
Yeah. Okay.

05:02.035 --> 05:03.537
I'll pick you up
tomorrow night.

05:03.571 --> 05:05.473
Usual time.
Bring your drill.

05:33.701 --> 05:36.003
CHANCE:
Anything on the undersurface
of the frontal lobes,

05:36.036 --> 05:38.171
any irritation
on the temporal lobes?

05:38.205 --> 05:39.540
SIMON: You've seen
hundreds of these, El.

05:39.573 --> 05:40.874
You know
how to look at them.

05:40.908 --> 05:42.843
I've seen hundreds,
you've seen thousands.

05:42.876 --> 05:45.012
You're clean, okay?

05:45.045 --> 05:46.980
When did you have
these scans done?

05:47.014 --> 05:49.883
This morning. Got them
to squeeze me in at UCSF

05:49.917 --> 05:51.251
before start of business.

05:51.284 --> 05:53.487
Now, what's that,
that right there?

05:53.521 --> 05:57.057
Only visible in one scan.
A normal variance.

05:57.090 --> 06:00.360
Which, for some reason, doesn't
seem like good news to you.

06:00.394 --> 06:01.895
Yeah.

06:01.929 --> 06:04.164
No, I mean, yeah.
It is. It --

06:04.197 --> 06:05.599
What's this about?

06:05.633 --> 06:06.900
Are you having symptoms?

06:06.934 --> 06:09.737
Impulsivity,
disinhibition,

06:09.770 --> 06:13.340
risk-taking,
euphoria, calamity.

06:13.373 --> 06:14.942
And you thought
it was a tumor?

06:14.975 --> 06:16.577
I kind of hoped it was.

06:20.113 --> 06:23.417
Dementia, hematoma,
hydrocephalus.

06:23.451 --> 06:26.420
As opposed to what?

06:26.454 --> 06:28.556
Abnormal psychology.

06:29.990 --> 06:32.926
I needed to know,
and now I do.

06:32.960 --> 06:35.228
The choices I'm making
are mine.

06:35.262 --> 06:36.630
So cut it out, then.

06:36.664 --> 06:38.365
Make different choices.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.468
Okay. Thanks.

06:40.501 --> 06:43.070
(chuckles)
(whirring)

06:46.474 --> 06:50.478
But it could also just be
a mid-life crisis, right?

06:50.511 --> 06:51.812
-Right?
-Shut up.

06:51.845 --> 06:53.814
(chuckles)

06:53.847 --> 06:55.516
Thanks, Simon.

07:03.957 --> 07:06.359
(siren wailing in distance)

07:28.181 --> 07:31.351
What did I tell you about us
coinciding again, huh?

07:31.384 --> 07:33.453
You followed us
into a store

07:33.487 --> 07:34.955
in broad daylight.

07:34.988 --> 07:36.790
The fuck
you thinking, hmm?

07:36.824 --> 07:38.792
Hey! Hey.

07:42.229 --> 07:45.298
There's a certain something
about her, though, isn't there?

07:45.332 --> 07:47.134
What, maybe you thought
you were the first?

07:47.167 --> 07:49.436
Maybe you think
you're The One?

07:49.469 --> 07:51.038
(chuckles)

07:51.071 --> 07:53.473
Oh, Doc...

07:53.507 --> 07:55.375
believe me, Doc.

07:55.408 --> 07:57.678
Whatever it is you think
you're into here with her,

07:57.711 --> 08:00.648
whatever it is you think
you're trying to do,

08:00.681 --> 08:03.383
you have no idea.

08:03.416 --> 08:05.352
And that's the last piece
of friendly advice

08:05.385 --> 08:06.954
you're ever going to get.

08:06.987 --> 08:09.990
In fact, this is the last time
you and I are going to speak,

08:10.023 --> 08:12.159
okay?

08:12.192 --> 08:14.294
Stay away from my wife.

08:14.327 --> 08:17.330
**

08:34.548 --> 08:37.551
**

08:42.189 --> 08:44.224
Dr. Chance?

08:44.257 --> 08:45.659
Are you all right?

08:45.693 --> 08:47.360
What happened?

08:49.630 --> 08:52.666
There was a --

08:52.700 --> 08:53.934
a man.

08:53.967 --> 08:56.570
Man was waiting for me.
Ohh.

08:56.604 --> 08:58.338
I-I-I'm good,
Juan-Battista.

08:58.371 --> 09:00.574
Just --
Just give me a second.

09:00.608 --> 09:02.776
-Did he rob you?
-Only of my dignity.

09:02.810 --> 09:05.045
But you were assaulted.
We should call the police.

09:05.078 --> 09:07.615
He i the police.

09:08.949 --> 09:11.919
It's the husband
of a patient.

09:11.952 --> 09:13.386
Estranged husband.

09:13.420 --> 09:14.822
Oh.

09:22.930 --> 09:25.098
You can keep that.

09:25.132 --> 09:28.602
"The Little Book
of Life After Death."

09:28.636 --> 09:31.404
What is this, a travel guide
for where I'm headed?

09:31.438 --> 09:33.641
Yes.

09:33.674 --> 09:35.709
But not today.

09:35.743 --> 09:38.578
Let me help you up.

09:38.612 --> 09:41.514
(groans)

09:44.317 --> 09:47.287
(door opens)

09:47.320 --> 09:48.121
Hey.

09:48.155 --> 09:49.489
I got here,

09:49.522 --> 09:53.560
and someone
was putting that up.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.562
Juan-Battista.

09:55.595 --> 09:58.799
Our building janitor.
He does that sometimes,

09:58.832 --> 10:01.669
hangs his photographs
on the sly.

10:01.702 --> 10:04.271
He's like a cat burglar
in reverse.

10:04.304 --> 10:05.906
Who is it?

10:05.939 --> 10:09.009
I don't know where he finds
his subjects, or why.

10:09.042 --> 10:10.744
Do you like it?

10:10.778 --> 10:12.479
It's upsetting.

10:12.512 --> 10:14.147
I don't think it'd be
the kind of thing

10:14.181 --> 10:16.684
you'd want
in a psychiatrist's office.

10:16.717 --> 10:20.520
Isn't he worried
about getting fired?

10:20.553 --> 10:21.822
You need some help?

10:21.855 --> 10:23.991
No, I'm okay,
Hannah, thank you.

10:24.024 --> 10:25.292
Helen.

10:25.325 --> 10:26.994
Helen, sorry.

10:27.027 --> 10:29.830
Oh, did your wife
get ahold of you?

10:29.863 --> 10:31.865
Christina, no. Why?
She call?

10:31.899 --> 10:33.701
No, she stopped by.

10:33.734 --> 10:36.369
-When?
-Yesterday afternoon.

10:36.403 --> 10:39.139
She waited in your office
for a while, and then she left.

10:39.172 --> 10:42.109
She say
what she wanted?

10:42.142 --> 10:46.013
No. She said you'd know.

10:46.046 --> 10:47.514
Light brown hair?

10:47.547 --> 10:50.150
No. Blonde.

11:35.729 --> 11:37.597
(cellphone chimes)

11:39.800 --> 11:41.101
(beep)

11:41.134 --> 11:43.103
Hi, D.

11:43.136 --> 11:45.038
He was here.
Blackstone.

11:45.072 --> 11:47.507
At my office, in the garage.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.209
Call me.

11:57.150 --> 11:58.786
(ringing)
(door shuts)

11:58.819 --> 12:00.754
SUZANNE: Is he in? No, no, no,
I can show myself in.

12:00.788 --> 12:02.622
No, thank you very much.

12:06.126 --> 12:08.228
You're a goddamn
liar, Eldon.

12:08.261 --> 12:09.797
What happened?

12:09.830 --> 12:12.432
You told me
that Myra Cohen was old,

12:12.465 --> 12:14.802
and she died
in a home invasion robbery.

12:14.835 --> 12:17.204
When did you start thinking
it was Blackstone,

12:17.237 --> 12:19.506
before you told me that
or since?

12:20.908 --> 12:22.575
My tires got slashed.

12:22.609 --> 12:24.711
When?
W-When did that happen?

12:24.744 --> 12:26.880
Last night
in front of my house.

12:26.914 --> 12:30.918
In front of my home, Eldon!

12:30.951 --> 12:33.821
Where I live!

12:33.854 --> 12:36.289
I can't go to the cops
with anything, right?

12:36.323 --> 12:38.826
Because we -- we both know
what this is, right?

12:38.859 --> 12:42.662
I have been your friend
for 20 years,

12:42.695 --> 12:44.731
and you didn't
give a shit?!

12:44.764 --> 12:48.335
You put me right in his path,
and now he's after me?!

12:48.368 --> 12:49.736
(grunts)

12:49.769 --> 12:51.138
What's wrong with you?

12:51.171 --> 12:54.641
He was here just now.
Blackstone. Gave me a beating.

12:54.674 --> 12:56.743
Oh, Jesus Christ.

12:56.776 --> 12:59.779
(sighs)
I-I'm sorry, Suzanne.

12:59.813 --> 13:02.182
-I never meant for you --
-You know, save it.

13:02.215 --> 13:04.952
You're not the victim here.
You had a choice at every turn,

13:04.985 --> 13:06.820
and now you're living
the consequences.

13:06.854 --> 13:08.421
Now I just
have to figure out

13:08.455 --> 13:10.690
how keep you
from taking me down with you.

13:13.827 --> 13:16.696
Well, you have to
step away.

13:16.729 --> 13:18.331
Make it official.

13:18.365 --> 13:20.533
E-mails,
phone calls, texts.

13:20.567 --> 13:22.669
He obviously has
ways of knowing,

13:22.702 --> 13:24.671
so let him know
that what he did worked,

13:24.704 --> 13:26.306
that you're no longer
a danger to him.

13:26.339 --> 13:27.474
Just walk away.

13:27.507 --> 13:29.676
That's it?

13:29.709 --> 13:30.978
That's all you got?

13:31.011 --> 13:35.382
For the moment,
that's all I got.

13:35.415 --> 13:37.417
-I'm sorry.
-Yeah, you said that.

13:40.353 --> 13:42.555
What about you?
What are you going to do?

13:51.932 --> 13:55.668
I don't know why I've been
fighting this so hard now,

13:55.702 --> 13:58.838
why I've been
so afraid for you.

13:58.872 --> 14:00.740
This is what you wanted
all along,

14:00.773 --> 14:02.642
and now you have it.

14:02.675 --> 14:04.277
You have it.

14:08.181 --> 14:09.082
(door closes)

14:22.229 --> 14:25.265
(seagull crying)

14:25.298 --> 14:27.767
(bell dings)

14:27.800 --> 14:30.270
CHANCE: William Mullen
is an 82-year-old,

14:30.303 --> 14:32.940
right-handed retired
Circuit Court judge

14:32.973 --> 14:35.508
who prefers to be
called Judge Billy.

14:35.542 --> 14:38.878
He is single
and has never been married.

14:38.912 --> 14:40.280
Questions have been raised

14:40.313 --> 14:42.349
regarding the possibility
of elder abuse

14:42.382 --> 14:44.717
by a female
in-home care provider,

14:44.751 --> 14:47.720
to whom Judge Mullen has given
more than $1 million

14:47.754 --> 14:52.059
in the form of a series of
checks from a money market fund.

14:52.092 --> 14:54.694
JUDGE BILLY:
Eight or nine checks, tops.

14:54.727 --> 14:55.795
(buzzer)

14:55.828 --> 14:58.932
None above...

14:58.966 --> 15:01.868
$5,000.

15:01.901 --> 15:05.205
Okay, well,
let's do the math here.

15:05.238 --> 15:08.908
Let's say it's nine,
and $5,000 each,

15:08.942 --> 15:11.744
that comes to $45,000.

15:11.778 --> 15:13.947
Now, the fund
shows withdrawals

15:13.981 --> 15:15.648
about 20 times that.

15:15.682 --> 15:18.418
I ever tell you
about the first time

15:18.451 --> 15:21.621
I met her, all dressed up?

15:21.654 --> 15:23.123
I told her, too.

15:23.156 --> 15:25.492
I told her
how beautiful she was.

15:25.525 --> 15:28.428
How did she respond?

15:28.461 --> 15:30.630
We fell in love.

15:30.663 --> 15:32.432
She use those words?

15:32.465 --> 15:34.801
And, yeah, I know

15:34.834 --> 15:38.638
the odds are that she's got
some ulterior motive.

15:38.671 --> 15:40.107
I don't care.

15:40.140 --> 15:42.509
I'm 82 years old,
for Christ's sake,

15:42.542 --> 15:45.078
and she's -- she's 50,
you know?

15:45.112 --> 15:48.982
But for me,
to be loved...

15:49.016 --> 15:52.585
(sighs)

15:52.619 --> 15:55.022
...for the first time
ever...

15:55.055 --> 15:57.790
you can't imagine

15:57.824 --> 16:01.294
what it's like.

16:01.328 --> 16:03.963
She's the real deal.

16:03.997 --> 16:08.168
And if she's not,
the real deal doesn't exist.

16:08.201 --> 16:09.869
Not in this life.

16:12.539 --> 16:14.641
By virtue of his relationship
with Reina,

16:14.674 --> 16:18.178
Judge Mullen has come
to feel valued.

16:18.211 --> 16:20.447
To his credit,
he acknowledges the possibility

16:20.480 --> 16:22.349
that he might have
been manipulated.

16:22.382 --> 16:23.883
Nevertheless,

16:23.916 --> 16:27.187
he keeps coming up against
the ultimate question --

16:27.220 --> 16:29.322
What value is money,

16:29.356 --> 16:31.158
or even life,

16:31.191 --> 16:33.260
without love?

16:35.095 --> 16:37.030
(cellphone ringing)

16:37.064 --> 16:38.698
-What happened?
-Where the hell have you been?

16:38.731 --> 16:40.900
Blackstone was
waiting for me.

16:40.933 --> 16:43.303
He saw me
in that fucking store.

16:43.336 --> 16:44.504
D: You all right?

16:44.537 --> 16:46.039
I don't think
anything's broken.

16:46.073 --> 16:47.707
-He hit you?
-Yes, a lot.

16:47.740 --> 16:48.875
Did he say anything?

16:48.908 --> 16:50.377
To stay away
from his wife.

16:50.410 --> 16:51.678
That's all he said?

16:51.711 --> 16:53.246
-Yeah.
-That's good, then.

16:53.280 --> 16:54.514
He doesn't know
we know about him.

16:54.547 --> 16:56.916
Oh, well, if that's good,
me getting my ass kicked,

16:56.949 --> 16:59.819
then, yeah, it was great.
It was fantastic.

16:59.852 --> 17:02.689
Look, we need to move
on this tonight.

17:02.722 --> 17:04.357
If we can't find anything
in his car,

17:04.391 --> 17:07.094
we'll break into
his house, his office,

17:07.127 --> 17:09.529
I don't know, his locker
at the police station.

17:09.562 --> 17:11.264
We just got to stop
fucking around.

17:11.298 --> 17:13.400
I like
the enthusiasm, Chief.

17:13.433 --> 17:16.869
-I'll be there at 6:00.
-I'm already ready.

17:16.903 --> 17:18.971
(cellphone clicks)

17:36.656 --> 17:39.025
Dr. Chance?

17:39.058 --> 17:41.728
Detective Hynes,
Fremont P.D.

17:41.761 --> 17:44.097
I recognized you
from your picture online.

17:44.131 --> 17:46.466
-Right.
-Tried your office,

17:46.499 --> 17:48.067
left a few messages
on your cellphone,

17:48.101 --> 17:49.536
didn't hear back.

17:49.569 --> 17:51.471
Tried your apartment, too.

17:51.504 --> 17:54.241
Yeah, sorry about that.
I --

17:54.274 --> 17:56.042
I was out quite late.
Busy time.

17:56.075 --> 17:58.711
You're a busy man.
I'll be quick.

17:58.745 --> 18:02.249
So, you want to do this here
or in your office?

18:13.092 --> 18:16.763
So how'd you know
Dr. Cohen again?

18:19.532 --> 18:21.568
We were colleagues.

18:21.601 --> 18:22.969
You worked together?

18:23.002 --> 18:25.838
Um, our paths crossed,

18:25.872 --> 18:28.641
academic conferences,
you know.

18:28.675 --> 18:31.444
Uh, I don't know.
That's why I'm asking.

18:31.478 --> 18:34.514
Is that where
you met her?

18:34.547 --> 18:36.549
You know, honestly,
I don't remember.

18:38.551 --> 18:40.487
Uh, I believe so, yes.

18:40.520 --> 18:43.022
The Gestalt
Conference, maybe.

18:43.055 --> 18:45.292
The whole is other
than the sum of its parts --

18:45.325 --> 18:46.926
that kind of thing.

18:46.959 --> 18:48.761
I used to go every year.

18:48.795 --> 18:50.463
Where do they hold
something like that?

18:50.497 --> 18:53.166
The...
Gestalt Conference?

18:53.200 --> 18:56.836
Palo Alto, usually.

18:56.869 --> 18:59.206
You ever
see Myra socially?

18:59.239 --> 19:00.473
Not really.

19:00.507 --> 19:02.175
But you were friendly.

19:02.209 --> 19:03.610
We were colleagues.

19:03.643 --> 19:05.278
You sleep with her?

19:05.312 --> 19:07.847
No.
(scoffs)

19:07.880 --> 19:10.483
No, I-I did not
sleep with her.

19:10.517 --> 19:13.653
Well, you didn't work together,
you weren't friends,

19:13.686 --> 19:16.489
and yet you wanted to see
crime scene photos

19:16.523 --> 19:18.057
of her dead.

19:20.427 --> 19:23.663
Her death was the talk
of our community.

19:23.696 --> 19:25.665
People were very shaken.

19:25.698 --> 19:27.567
In our line of work,
we deal with any number

19:27.600 --> 19:29.702
of unstable individuals.

19:29.736 --> 19:31.838
You think she was killed
by a patient?

19:31.871 --> 19:33.240
I didn't say that.

19:33.273 --> 19:35.007
Well, she ever mention

19:35.041 --> 19:37.210
any particular
unstable individual,

19:37.244 --> 19:39.145
any patient
she was afraid of?

19:39.178 --> 19:40.880
We never
discussed patients.

19:40.913 --> 19:43.583
Very professional.

19:43.616 --> 19:44.817
You okay?

19:44.851 --> 19:49.589
Yeah, I just got
some...indigestion.

19:49.622 --> 19:51.524
Huh.

19:51.558 --> 19:54.227
So, anyway,

19:54.261 --> 19:55.928
why the sudden interest?

19:55.962 --> 19:59.932
I don't know. I-I guess
I was at the courthouse,

19:59.966 --> 20:02.201
and, uh...

20:02.235 --> 20:05.605
I don't know, maybe being there
just reminded me of her.

20:09.642 --> 20:11.744
I really am sorry,
but I --

20:11.778 --> 20:14.213
I have to collect
my daughter from school

20:14.247 --> 20:15.748
-and I'm already late.
-Oh, of course.

20:15.782 --> 20:17.450
I wouldn't want
to keep you from that.

20:17.484 --> 20:19.252
I'm a father myself.

20:19.286 --> 20:22.755
Just surprising that somebody
was inquiring about Myra is all,

20:22.789 --> 20:23.956
you know, reawakened it.

20:23.990 --> 20:25.392
And your name
never came up,

20:25.425 --> 20:28.628
so I was curious,
even hopeful.

20:28.661 --> 20:31.197
You never know
where a lead could come from,

20:31.230 --> 20:33.866
or -- or when.

20:33.900 --> 20:36.869
So if I think of anything else
you could help me on

20:36.903 --> 20:39.439
or any questions,
I'll be in touch.

20:39.472 --> 20:40.907
-Is that all right?
-Of course.

20:40.940 --> 20:43.410
Great.
Thanks so much.

20:43.443 --> 20:45.878
I'm going to check out
that nutty picture

20:45.912 --> 20:48.147
you have out in the hallway
again before I leave.

20:48.180 --> 20:51.818
Something about it
speaks to me.

20:51.851 --> 20:53.686
-Thanks for your time.
-Sure.

20:58.358 --> 21:03.162
**

21:03.195 --> 21:06.032
(indistinct conversations)

21:29.322 --> 21:30.557
Hey.

21:32.692 --> 21:33.760
Who's that?

21:33.793 --> 21:36.028
Can we just go?

21:36.062 --> 21:38.598
Oh, come on.
What's his name?

21:38.631 --> 21:39.832
Dad.

21:39.866 --> 21:41.801
Terrible name.

21:41.834 --> 21:43.336
How will we
keep that straight?

21:43.370 --> 21:44.871
(seat belt buckles)

21:44.904 --> 21:46.105
(engine starts)

21:46.138 --> 21:49.008
Hey, what's with Berkeley?

21:49.041 --> 21:51.143
Any new apartments
to check out?

21:51.177 --> 21:54.113
Preferably ones we can get
before someone else gets them,

21:54.146 --> 21:56.048
because you didn't call,
even though you said you would?

21:56.082 --> 21:59.386
Hey, you know that futon
you said I need to get?

21:59.419 --> 22:01.488
Why don't we go buy
one of those right now?

22:04.056 --> 22:05.725
Yeah.

22:14.734 --> 22:16.035
You got --
You got keys, right?

22:16.068 --> 22:17.637
-Yeah.
-All right.

22:17.670 --> 22:19.539
I just got to get my bag.
Thank you, gentlemen.

22:19.572 --> 22:20.807
MAN: You got it.

22:20.840 --> 22:23.676
(Dog barking,
car horns honking)

22:30.550 --> 22:32.819
(sighs)

22:32.852 --> 22:36.055
Hi.

22:36.088 --> 22:37.557
I hope it's all right.

22:37.590 --> 22:38.758
Coming here.

22:40.393 --> 22:43.996
I think we're past that.

22:44.030 --> 22:46.399
I'm glad you came.
It's good to see you.

22:46.433 --> 22:50.202
I just --
I wanted to talk to you...

22:50.236 --> 22:52.004
about what happened...

22:52.038 --> 22:54.974
at the store, the park.

22:59.078 --> 23:00.713
Are you all right?

23:00.747 --> 23:03.215
Your husband
paid me a visit.

23:03.249 --> 23:06.052
Oh, my God.

23:06.085 --> 23:08.254
So did you, apparently.

23:13.660 --> 23:17.196
You came to my office,
said you were my wife.

23:17.229 --> 23:19.198
I don't remember that.

23:19.231 --> 23:22.935
I'm sorry I don't know.

23:22.969 --> 23:26.973
That I'm like this.

23:27.006 --> 23:29.375
That he hurt you.

23:29.408 --> 23:31.611
You don't deserve
to be hurt.

23:33.613 --> 23:35.482
Why don't you come in
out of the wind?

23:48.761 --> 23:50.563
You look nice.

23:50.597 --> 23:53.299
There was a thing,
a luncheon,

23:53.332 --> 23:55.101
for Raymond.

23:55.134 --> 23:57.303
I didn't want to go.

23:57.336 --> 24:00.740
Uh, he helped shut down
some massage parlors in Oakland.

24:00.773 --> 24:02.441
They gave him a medal.

24:02.475 --> 24:04.243
So he's a hero.

24:04.276 --> 24:06.779
With our luck,
he'll end up Chief of Police.

24:06.813 --> 24:09.982
He's seven months away
from full pension.

24:10.016 --> 24:13.152
And when he vests,
we're leaving town,

24:13.185 --> 24:14.821
just the two of us.

24:16.556 --> 24:18.324
To go where?

24:18.357 --> 24:19.692
He just says,

24:19.726 --> 24:22.662
"Somewhere far away
from all this shit."

24:22.695 --> 24:25.431
(sighs)

24:25.464 --> 24:28.668
I shouldn't be
dumping all this on you.

24:28.701 --> 24:33.439
But...things are just
hard right now.

24:33.472 --> 24:35.207
I've tried to leave
messages for Suzanne,

24:35.241 --> 24:37.209
but she doesn't
return my calls.

24:37.243 --> 24:39.311
I don't know --
She told me that you stole money

24:39.345 --> 24:40.847
from her friend.

24:40.880 --> 24:42.014
$2,000.

24:42.048 --> 24:44.684
I know.

24:44.717 --> 24:47.854
-She asked me about that.
-They want it back.

24:47.887 --> 24:50.056
But I don't have it.

24:50.089 --> 24:51.223
I would never --

24:51.257 --> 24:54.694
She also had
her tires slashed.

24:54.727 --> 24:58.264
She thinks she knows who,
and you and I know she's right.

25:04.537 --> 25:07.039
So...

25:07.073 --> 25:09.542
What now?

25:09.576 --> 25:11.410
She's done.

25:19.886 --> 25:21.453
What about you?

25:23.790 --> 25:25.825
I'm not.

25:25.858 --> 25:28.227
I'm not done, Jaclyn.
I'm not going anywhere.

25:34.867 --> 25:37.770
You were going to tell me
about that park and the store.

25:37.804 --> 25:38.738
Yes.

25:38.771 --> 25:42.441
But it was Jackie
in the park.

25:42.474 --> 25:44.276
'Cause Jackie
makes you lose time.

25:46.212 --> 25:48.881
So how'd you remember it?

25:48.915 --> 25:50.617
(elevator clanking)

25:50.650 --> 25:52.318
(elevator bell dings)

25:56.723 --> 25:58.625
-Thank you, guys. Thank you.
-Sure.

25:58.658 --> 26:01.093
Dad, I gave them the rest
of the pizza money for a tip,

26:01.127 --> 26:02.895
because I didn't know
where you were.

26:02.929 --> 26:04.463
Hello.

26:04.496 --> 26:06.565
Hi.

26:06.599 --> 26:10.069
Yeah, that's a good call
with the tip.

26:10.102 --> 26:13.372
Be right up, okay?

26:13.405 --> 26:15.808
You know what?

26:15.842 --> 26:18.945
This might be the exact color

26:18.978 --> 26:20.913
of your eyes.

26:20.947 --> 26:23.650
Right? Isn't it perfect?

26:26.518 --> 26:28.254
You should have this.

26:31.257 --> 26:34.293
It looks better
on you anyway.

26:34.326 --> 26:36.328
Really?

26:36.362 --> 26:38.330
Wow. Thanks.

26:38.364 --> 26:40.900
That's very kind.

26:40.933 --> 26:43.002
Well, you know where we are
if you want it back.

26:47.006 --> 26:49.475
(sighs)

26:49.508 --> 26:51.510
She's beautiful.

26:54.681 --> 26:56.115
Jaclyn.

27:00.352 --> 27:04.123
I don't know
why I remember it.

27:04.156 --> 27:05.825
But I do.

27:05.858 --> 27:08.027
Which part?

27:10.529 --> 27:12.364
Everything.

27:36.355 --> 27:39.325
NICOLE: She's nice.

27:39.358 --> 27:41.193
That lady
you were talking to?

27:43.495 --> 27:45.732
What's her deal?

27:45.765 --> 27:49.201
Patient.
Former patient.

27:49.235 --> 27:50.669
A patient can live
where you live?

27:50.703 --> 27:52.338
-What do you mean?
-In the building.

27:52.371 --> 27:54.707
I thought she lived here.
I've seen her.

27:56.275 --> 27:59.411
-When?
-Last week, maybe.

27:59.445 --> 28:00.813
On the stairs, I think.

28:00.847 --> 28:03.983
Hey, mind if I steal
a pillow off your bed?

28:04.016 --> 28:06.719
Oh, Nic, uh, I'm sorry,

28:06.753 --> 28:09.088
I-I lost track of time.

28:09.121 --> 28:11.924
I thought you said once we got
the futon, I could stay over.

28:11.958 --> 28:14.727
Yeah, yeah, you can,
but, uh...

28:14.761 --> 28:17.563
not tonight. I-I've got to
be somewhere for work.

28:17.596 --> 28:20.166
I've stayed here
by myself before.

28:20.199 --> 28:22.769
I know you have,
and you will again.

28:22.802 --> 28:25.104
We got the futon.
Ready to go?

28:25.137 --> 28:27.406
I know. I helped.

28:29.742 --> 28:33.112
So, are you seeing her,
like girlfriend seeing her?

28:33.145 --> 28:35.281
No, I'm not.
She's --

28:35.314 --> 28:37.183
Like I said,
she's a former patient.

28:37.216 --> 28:39.952
A patient who comes
to your apartment.

28:39.986 --> 28:43.856
There are a lot of chaotic
things in her life right now.

28:43.890 --> 28:47.726
She's in an abusive
situation, and I'm --

28:47.760 --> 28:49.595
We're trying to help.

28:49.628 --> 28:51.864
Would it be wrong
if you went out with her?

28:51.898 --> 28:53.432
Because she's a patient?

28:53.465 --> 28:55.134
Yes.

28:55.167 --> 28:57.369
At the moment.

28:57.403 --> 28:58.637
If enough time passed...

28:58.670 --> 29:01.407
How much time
is enough time?

29:01.440 --> 29:03.309
-Nic...
-She likes you.

29:03.342 --> 29:04.911
I could tell.

29:04.944 --> 29:07.980
Plus, she's really pretty.

29:08.014 --> 29:09.816
Or maybe you just
want to be alone.

29:34.506 --> 29:36.442
D: Furniture store
was two days ago.

29:36.475 --> 29:39.678
Why'd he wait until today
to come at you?

29:39.711 --> 29:41.814
I don't know.

29:41.848 --> 29:43.249
Maybe it's like she said.

29:43.282 --> 29:45.451
He likes
to fuck with people.

29:45.484 --> 29:47.453
Wanted me to think
I'd gotten away with it,

29:47.486 --> 29:48.620
spying on them.

29:48.654 --> 29:52.124
Also, he slashed
my friend's tires, Suzanne,

29:52.158 --> 29:55.094
a therapist who was seeing
Jaclyn at my request.

29:55.127 --> 29:56.362
Interesting move.

29:56.395 --> 29:57.964
He's becoming impulsive,

29:57.997 --> 29:59.598
reacting.

29:59.631 --> 30:02.634
All good for us.

30:02.668 --> 30:04.803
Muffles the sound.

30:08.474 --> 30:10.376
Why so many of those?

30:10.409 --> 30:12.711
Backups.

30:12.744 --> 30:15.281
Your face is clean.

30:15.314 --> 30:17.683
Must have gotten you
with body shots.

30:17.716 --> 30:20.652
He did. Very effective.

30:20.686 --> 30:23.389
Yeah, no shit.
Cops like that sort of thing.

30:23.422 --> 30:26.225
Doesn't fuck up their hands,
harder to see the evidence.

30:26.258 --> 30:28.394
Lucky he didn't
use a stick.

30:28.427 --> 30:30.662
-You in pain?
-Little bit.

30:30.696 --> 30:32.698
Taking anything for it?

30:32.731 --> 30:35.534
When I self-medicate,

30:35.567 --> 30:37.236
tends to lead
to poor results

30:37.269 --> 30:39.005
at the best of times.

30:39.038 --> 30:42.008
Also kind of
feels like surrender.

30:42.041 --> 30:43.976
So I'm going
to ride this out.

30:44.010 --> 30:46.045
Good answer.

30:50.549 --> 30:53.085
The section outlined in blue
is Ghost Town.

30:53.119 --> 30:54.820
The blue pins
are massage parlors

30:54.853 --> 30:56.255
that haven't been shut down.

30:56.288 --> 30:57.856
-Four of them.
-Yeah.

30:57.890 --> 31:00.392
And one of them's
Blackstone.

31:00.426 --> 31:03.462
**

31:12.271 --> 31:14.040
Which one was it?

31:14.073 --> 31:15.507
CHANCE: Good question.

31:15.541 --> 31:17.743
Today, it was Jaclyn.

31:17.776 --> 31:19.678
But I don't know
which one came to my office

31:19.711 --> 31:21.213
or who my daughter
seems to think

31:21.247 --> 31:23.983
she's seen walking around
the apartment building.

31:27.553 --> 31:31.257
You know, until
a couple months ago,

31:31.290 --> 31:32.758
and I never
told anyone this --

31:32.791 --> 31:34.260
But I never used to buy

31:34.293 --> 31:36.895
the whole multiple
personality thing.

31:36.929 --> 31:39.765
I mean, dissociative
identity issues, yeah,

31:39.798 --> 31:42.568
but completely
separate personalities,

31:42.601 --> 31:45.904
what people call
"alters"? No way.

31:45.938 --> 31:47.273
If someone came in
claiming that,

31:47.306 --> 31:49.141
my first thought
would be "borderline."

31:49.175 --> 31:52.244
What's borderline?

31:52.278 --> 31:54.146
(sighs)
Short answer,

31:54.180 --> 31:55.948
it's a serious
mental illness,

31:55.982 --> 31:58.917
it's very hard to diagnose
and even harder to treat.

31:58.951 --> 32:00.786
Some people think
it's untreatable.

32:03.655 --> 32:05.791
That would qualify
as fucked up.

32:05.824 --> 32:08.627
That what she is?

32:08.660 --> 32:10.329
I hope not.

32:12.331 --> 32:14.400
I hope...

32:14.433 --> 32:17.069
that parts of her have been
fragmented by trauma,

32:17.103 --> 32:19.605
that parts can be
made whole again,

32:19.638 --> 32:21.507
if it's not too late.

32:24.276 --> 32:26.612
Sheyour frozen lake.

32:31.817 --> 32:33.319
Fuck this place.
Let's move.

32:35.887 --> 32:38.124
You ever see a movie
called "Blue Angel" --

32:38.157 --> 32:40.192
"The Blue Angel,"
I think?

32:40.226 --> 32:41.994
No.

32:42.028 --> 32:43.929
You know who
Marlene Dietrich is?

32:43.962 --> 32:45.631
No.

32:45.664 --> 32:48.100
Doesn't matter. She plays
a singer at a Berlin club.

32:48.134 --> 32:52.104
And this aging professor
becomes obsessed with her.

32:52.138 --> 32:55.107
And suffice it to say,

32:55.141 --> 32:57.676
he goes out
on his frozen lake,

32:57.709 --> 32:58.810
and the ice breaks.

33:03.482 --> 33:07.019
I've done this
once before.

33:07.053 --> 33:10.622
I've gone out where
the ice is thinnest.

33:10.656 --> 33:15.194
This that shit about you
that Blackstone dug up?

33:15.227 --> 33:17.996
I was an ER resident
in Boston.

33:18.030 --> 33:20.399
And she walked in
one night.

33:20.432 --> 33:22.501
I don't even remember
what for.

33:22.534 --> 33:25.204
She was released within an hour,
but that's all it took.

33:25.237 --> 33:28.174
And I knew where she lived.

33:28.207 --> 33:30.676
At first, I thought I was --
I was just in love.

33:30.709 --> 33:32.844
I convinced myself
that she felt as I did.

33:32.878 --> 33:34.380
She didn't.

33:34.413 --> 33:36.682
She left, I followed.

33:36.715 --> 33:37.949
And...

33:40.086 --> 33:42.854
...things got...

33:42.888 --> 33:44.890
more fucked up after that.

33:47.726 --> 33:50.729
Biggest casualty
was my father,

33:50.762 --> 33:54.266
my relationship
with him.

33:54.300 --> 33:56.335
We'd been close,
but we stopped speaking,

33:56.368 --> 33:59.271
and he...

33:59.305 --> 34:01.973
died of a heart attack
within a year.

34:11.450 --> 34:13.785
The exultation
of wanting...

34:16.588 --> 34:19.291
...and the recognition
that the object of such desires

34:19.325 --> 34:21.893
is forever unavailable...

34:24.130 --> 34:26.432
...unknowable at her core.

34:29.168 --> 34:32.938
I would have killed my father
if I could have.

34:32.971 --> 34:34.806
I would have
scalped the fucker.

34:37.643 --> 34:40.112
Lucky I was short
on training then.

34:40.146 --> 34:42.181
(siren wailing in distance)

34:45.284 --> 34:46.418
Fucking "A."

34:48.754 --> 34:51.290
Girl from the dog park.

34:51.323 --> 34:52.991
Let's go see
what's out back.

35:03.702 --> 35:06.172
(Indistinct conversations,
shouting)

35:33.565 --> 35:34.633
Put this on.

35:34.666 --> 35:37.469
You look like a citizen.

35:39.471 --> 35:41.440
What about you?

35:41.473 --> 35:42.841
Aren't you going
to get cold?

35:42.874 --> 35:44.976
I don't get cold.

35:45.010 --> 35:47.145
Well, then,
why the jacket?

35:47.179 --> 35:49.080
Just another place
to hang my blades.

35:52.318 --> 35:55.086
Keep your hands on the outside,
you won't get cut.

36:07.766 --> 36:09.468
This, too.

36:09.501 --> 36:11.237
D, come on.

36:11.270 --> 36:12.638
What's the worse
that can happen?

36:12.671 --> 36:14.540
Head lice?

36:14.573 --> 36:15.641
Use Kwell.

36:15.674 --> 36:17.976
You'll need
a prescription,

36:18.009 --> 36:19.278
but you
got that covered.

36:23.282 --> 36:26.585
Hug the wall,
stay in the shadow,

36:26.618 --> 36:28.820
go slow.

36:28.854 --> 36:30.856
Just remember,
we're a couple of homeless fucks

36:30.889 --> 36:32.624
looking for shit.

36:38.129 --> 36:39.365
(crash)

36:39.398 --> 36:41.933
(Men speaking
foreign language)

36:46.137 --> 36:47.739
MAN: Hey!

36:51.743 --> 36:52.811
What's the language?

36:55.281 --> 36:57.383
I don't know.
Russian? Romanian?

37:05.891 --> 37:08.727
(Men continue grunting,
speaking foreign language)

37:23.742 --> 37:26.312
(clattering)
MAN: Help!

37:34.252 --> 37:36.655
See the Crown Vic, Doc?

37:36.688 --> 37:39.325
It's our lucky night.

37:47.299 --> 37:49.435
Here.

37:49.468 --> 37:51.770
Lake Merritt.

37:51.803 --> 37:53.772
I mean, that's got to be
a mile, at least.

37:53.805 --> 37:55.240
Is there nowhere closer?

37:55.273 --> 37:56.942
Park is good.

37:56.975 --> 37:59.445
Shit goes sideways, I'd rather
lose people over ground

37:59.478 --> 38:01.347
than run
straight to a car.

38:01.380 --> 38:02.948
I was in the teams.

38:02.981 --> 38:05.517
We used to do these drills,
sneak and peek.

38:05.551 --> 38:09.287
Drop a guy off in a city,
give him a rendezvous point.

38:09.321 --> 38:11.022
He has to get there
without being spotted

38:11.056 --> 38:12.691
by any of the other guys
in the squad

38:12.724 --> 38:14.626
who are now out
looking for him.

38:14.660 --> 38:17.796
The point is,
study the lines and shadows,

38:17.829 --> 38:20.332
the angles of sight,
learn how to use them,

38:20.366 --> 38:22.368
make yourself invisible.

38:22.401 --> 38:24.169
Terrain like this,

38:24.202 --> 38:27.539
lots of places
to double back, set traps.

38:27.573 --> 38:29.608
Not just about
being hard to follow,

38:29.641 --> 38:32.177
it's about being
dangerous to follow.

38:32.210 --> 38:33.979
-Make sense?
-Sure.

38:34.012 --> 38:35.681
So we leave the car
at Lake Merritt

38:35.714 --> 38:37.616
so we can lose people
over ground

38:37.649 --> 38:39.785
and get back to it
if we need to.

38:39.818 --> 38:42.788
"We" don't do any of that.
You'll be in the car.

38:42.821 --> 38:44.890
I'm going to be
sitting in the park?

38:44.923 --> 38:47.526
Why, because
you're a ninja now?

38:47.559 --> 38:48.994
Well, no, but --

38:49.027 --> 38:52.364
Look, if shit pops off,
I can't be worrying about you.

38:52.398 --> 38:54.400
I need you where I can
find you, ready to roll.

38:54.433 --> 38:58.003
I need a wheel man.
We down?

38:58.036 --> 39:00.205
-If you say so.
-I say so.

39:00.238 --> 39:01.407
Here.

39:01.440 --> 39:04.042
You want this
while you wait?

39:04.075 --> 39:05.544
"Ignore Everybody."

39:05.577 --> 39:08.013
Great fucking read.

39:08.046 --> 39:10.248
Are you kidding me?
I'm going to be reading a book?

39:10.281 --> 39:12.684
Why not?
I always have a book.

39:12.718 --> 39:14.085
I can be on patrol,

39:14.119 --> 39:16.054
middle of some
shit storm somewhere,

39:16.087 --> 39:17.989
it's a great exercise
for the mind.

39:18.023 --> 39:20.025
Be the still point
in the turning world.

39:20.058 --> 39:22.327
Well, thank you,
but I have my own.

39:22.360 --> 39:24.430
Lucky you.

39:24.463 --> 39:26.465
(engine starts)

39:30.869 --> 39:32.771
(Drill whirring
intermittently)

39:58.063 --> 39:59.531
"Tribe Called Red"?

39:59.565 --> 40:02.400
Native American
battle music.

40:02.434 --> 40:04.970
Put it on.
Keep the windows up.

40:05.003 --> 40:06.472
Track 3.

40:06.505 --> 40:08.740
(drum music playing)

40:08.774 --> 40:11.076
(volume increases)

40:11.109 --> 40:14.112
**

40:24.089 --> 40:27.559
(men chanting shrilly)

40:27.593 --> 40:31.162
**

40:31.196 --> 40:34.265
(men chanting shrilly)

40:34.299 --> 40:35.601
We're good.

40:35.634 --> 40:37.936
See you at Lake Merritt.

40:37.969 --> 40:41.106
(chanting continues)

40:52.050 --> 40:54.152
(music stops)

41:02.828 --> 41:03.662
(sighs)

41:35.060 --> 41:37.295
CHANCE:
"Man lives upon the earth,

41:37.328 --> 41:39.831
not once, but three times.

41:39.865 --> 41:43.702
His first stage of life
is a continuous sleep.

41:43.735 --> 41:45.571
The second is an alternation

41:45.604 --> 41:48.039
between sleeping and waking.

41:48.073 --> 41:51.743
The third is
an eternal waking."

41:51.777 --> 41:54.580
(men chanting loudly)

41:54.613 --> 41:56.414
**

41:56.447 --> 41:58.383
(music stops)

42:01.753 --> 42:03.889
(dog barking in distance)

42:12.764 --> 42:14.766
(indistinct conversations)

42:40.726 --> 42:41.927
How'd it go?

42:41.960 --> 42:44.796
You might want to get us
out of here, brother.

42:44.830 --> 42:46.464
For Christ's sake.

42:46.497 --> 42:48.266
(engine starts)

42:51.837 --> 42:53.204
So what happened?

42:53.238 --> 42:57.743
It's a story.

42:57.776 --> 42:59.477
Got you this,
you still want it.

42:59.510 --> 43:00.946
Why would I
not want it?

43:00.979 --> 43:02.981
Mission was compromised.

43:03.982 --> 43:05.651
Do you have his files?

43:05.684 --> 43:07.585
Is that why you're asking
if I -- if I still want it?

43:07.619 --> 43:09.054
You --
There's nothing on there,

43:09.087 --> 43:10.789
or you didn't
get time to download?

43:10.822 --> 43:12.223
I didn't say
the mission was aborted,

43:12.257 --> 43:13.725
I said
it was compromised.

43:13.759 --> 43:15.927
There was collateral damage.
It's been taken care of.

43:15.961 --> 43:18.463
What exactly are you sa--
What are you telling me?

43:18.496 --> 43:20.899
What about "collateral damage"
and "taken care of"

43:20.932 --> 43:22.467
do you not understand?

43:22.500 --> 43:25.336
(tires screeching)

43:25.370 --> 43:27.739
Any of it! I need this
in plain English, D.

43:27.773 --> 43:29.174
I need to know
what happened back there.

43:29.207 --> 43:31.342
Actually, you don't.
The more you know,

43:31.376 --> 43:32.410
the more you're in.

43:32.443 --> 43:34.780
I'd say I'm pretty
damn deep in already.

43:34.813 --> 43:36.748
Can you get us
on the freeway?

43:36.782 --> 43:39.985
Jesus, are you telling me
you killed him?

43:40.018 --> 43:42.921
If by "him,"
you mean Blackstone,

43:42.954 --> 43:45.290
no. I didn't kill him.

43:45.323 --> 43:46.457
Least I don't think I did.

43:51.663 --> 43:53.665
It'd be good to get
across the bridge.

43:53.699 --> 43:55.300
I'm not saying
they'll close it...

43:55.333 --> 43:57.002
but you never know.

43:57.035 --> 43:59.337
When one of their own goes down,
all bets are off.

44:03.041 --> 44:06.878
(car horn blaring)

44:06.912 --> 44:08.880
(crash)

44:08.914 --> 44:11.917
