00:51.980 --> 00:53.474
Gentlemen,

00:53.607 --> 00:58.683
this may only be an exercise so far as
the Ministry of Defense is concerned,

00:58.820 --> 01:04.858
but for me it is a matter of pride that the
00-Section has been chosen for this test.

01:04.992 --> 01:09.739
Your objective is to penetrate
the radar installations of Gibraltar.

01:09.873 --> 01:12.993
The SAS have been placed
on full alert to intercept you,

01:13.126 --> 01:15.582
but I know you won't let me down.

01:16.505 --> 01:18.331
Good luck, men.

01:26.034 --> 01:27.777
Oh, blast!

02:22.173 --> 02:24.000
Damn!

02:32.308 --> 02:35.060
That's it, chum. You're out of it.

03:05.800 --> 03:08.338
Game's up, mate. You're dead.

03:24.068 --> 03:25.894
No!

04:24.836 --> 04:26.745
Halt.

04:32.052 --> 04:34.091
Here! Hold on, you're dead!

06:57.779 --> 07:02.737
It's all so boring here, Margot. There's
nothing but playboys and tennis pros.

07:03.285 --> 07:05.361
If only I could find a real man!

07:12.460 --> 07:14.500
I need to use your phone.

07:14.629 --> 07:17.120
She'll call you back.

07:17.549 --> 07:20.799
- Who are you?
- Bond. James Bond.

07:20.928 --> 07:24.094
Exercise control, 007 here.
I'll report in an hour.

07:25.014 --> 07:27.387
Won't you join me?

07:28.894 --> 07:30.720
Better make that two.

10:18.353 --> 10:21.520
BRATISLAVA, CZECHOSLOVAKIA

10:55.556 --> 10:58.890
Saunders, head of Section V, Vienna.
You're bloody late.

10:59.018 --> 11:01.804
This is a mission, not a fancy-dress ball.

11:02.437 --> 11:04.478
We have time.

11:06.650 --> 11:10.599
- Now, where's our man?
- In the box. Between the KGB minders.

11:20.790 --> 11:23.114
Lovely girl with the cello.

11:24.711 --> 11:26.952
Forget the ladies for once, Bond.

11:27.087 --> 11:30.123
Koskov will leave here at the interval.

11:31.425 --> 11:33.465
We'd better go.

12:06.918 --> 12:08.958
Turn off the lights.

12:27.564 --> 12:32.771
Now, let's understand one another, Bond.
General Koskov is a top KGB mastermind.

12:32.903 --> 12:35.773
His defection is my baby.
He contacted me.

12:35.905 --> 12:38.479
I've planned this out to the last detail.

12:39.993 --> 12:44.869
- You'll want the soft-nosed ones, I expect.
- No, the steel-tipped.

12:44.998 --> 12:47.952
KGB snipers usually wear body armor.

12:48.418 --> 12:53.246
- What's your escape route?
- Sorry, old man. Section 26, paragraph 5.

12:53.381 --> 12:57.000
That information is on
a need-to-know basis only.

12:57.136 --> 12:59.008
I'm sure you understand.

12:59.137 --> 13:01.923
Koskov is under
intensive KGB surveillance.

13:02.056 --> 13:04.299
A sniper has been assigned to watch him

13:04.434 --> 13:07.518
and he expressly asked
for you to protect him.

13:08.563 --> 13:12.062
- Why me?
- He has the impression you're the best.

13:14.610 --> 13:17.694
- Where's the car?
- In the alley out the back.

13:26.247 --> 13:28.286
Bring the chair.

13:42.888 --> 13:46.138
It'll take him about
10 seconds to reach us.

13:46.266 --> 13:49.932
Plenty of time for a sniper
to make strawberry jam of him!

14:38.276 --> 14:40.518
There's Koskov now.

14:44.658 --> 14:46.697
What's he waiting for?

14:47.744 --> 14:50.745
Sniper. Two floors up, center window.

14:54.167 --> 14:56.244
The girl with the cello!

15:03.009 --> 15:04.718
Fire, Bond, fire!

15:08.097 --> 15:10.589
Shoot her! What are you waiting for?

15:14.228 --> 15:16.601
You missed deliberately!

15:50.348 --> 15:51.130
Where is he?

15:51.265 --> 15:53.424
- In the boot.
- First place they'd look.

15:53.558 --> 15:55.885
- But my escape route...
- Scrubbed.

15:56.855 --> 15:59.012
Get in the front.

15:59.148 --> 16:02.018
- James. James Bond!
- Later, General.

16:03.486 --> 16:07.863
Lose them. I'll pick you up at the border.
2300 hours. Be there.

16:07.990 --> 16:10.861
- How will you get him out?
- Sorry, old man.

16:10.993 --> 16:15.537
Section 26, paragraph 5: "need-to-know".
I'm sure you understand.

16:22.922 --> 16:25.211
- The sniper was a woman.
- I noticed.

16:28.218 --> 16:30.626
Some of the best KGB shots are women.

16:34.891 --> 16:37.643
- Did you?
- I'd rather not talk about it.

16:37.769 --> 16:39.596
No, of course not.

16:46.695 --> 16:51.322
They are looking for me! If they
close the border, how will I get out?

16:51.450 --> 16:56.077
Don't you worry about that, Georgi.
We have a pipeline to the West.

17:10.218 --> 17:12.709
- Rosika Miklos.
- Our man here.

17:12.846 --> 17:15.516
Good to work with you again, Mr. Bond.
Come.

17:17.724 --> 17:19.635
Keep quiet.

17:36.286 --> 17:39.571
- We must hurry. Get him in the pig.
- Pig? What is pig?

17:39.706 --> 17:44.866
Scouring plug to clean out the pipeline.
This one's been designed to carry a man.

17:45.003 --> 17:47.374
Pipeline? You mean our pipeline?

17:47.505 --> 17:51.123
Great Soviet achievement -
piping natural gas into the West.

17:51.259 --> 17:54.628
- But not me!
- Don't worry, Georgi. It's a piece of cake.

17:54.763 --> 17:59.258
Never mind cake. If you open valve
before 100, he will be borsch!

17:59.642 --> 18:02.846
Pigs! Borsch! Cake!
There must be another way!

18:03.688 --> 18:08.149
Get in. Put on the mask
and breathe normally.

18:08.276 --> 18:10.482
- Enough talk!
- Relax, Georgi.

18:10.611 --> 18:12.937
Our people have spent months on this.

18:13.072 --> 18:16.691
- How many times have you done this?
- You're the first.

18:26.043 --> 18:30.041
Remember. When this says 100,
turn this. Not before.

18:31.257 --> 18:34.091
- Where are you going?
- To take care of the supervisor.

18:34.217 --> 18:38.512
When pig goes, his control panel
will light up like Christmas tree.

19:29.397 --> 19:32.434
What kind of girl do you think I am!

20:03.348 --> 20:05.387
Welcome to Austria, General.

20:07.936 --> 20:09.975
Come on. Up you go.

20:10.897 --> 20:12.937
Come on, hurry up!

20:31.626 --> 20:33.868
That's right. We've got him.

20:42.011 --> 20:44.051
Excuse me. Shut it now.

20:48.268 --> 20:50.307
Thank you.

21:46.283 --> 21:49.319
Cheer up, Saunders.
The operation's a success.

21:51.163 --> 21:56.323
- And officially still yours.
- I don't intend to leave it at that, 007.

21:57.044 --> 22:01.421
I'm telling M you deliberately missed.
Your orders were to kill that sniper.

22:01.548 --> 22:05.331
Stuff my orders. I only kill professionals.

22:05.468 --> 22:08.719
That girl didn't know
one end of a rifle from the other.

22:08.848 --> 22:12.798
Go ahead. Tell M what you want.
If he fires me, I'll thank him for it.

22:14.186 --> 22:18.135
Whoever she was, I must have
scared the living daylights out of her.

22:18.856 --> 22:21.264
Russian general defects!

22:23.570 --> 22:27.782
Ula Yarkhov. Confirmed kills, three.
Probable kills, two.

22:27.908 --> 22:32.784
Assassination methods:
Strangulation with hands or thighs.

22:32.913 --> 22:34.952
James, she's just your type!

22:35.081 --> 22:37.369
Wrong again, Moneypenny. You are.

22:37.500 --> 22:40.372
I'll file that
with the other secret information.

22:40.587 --> 22:43.291
Specialist-child impersonations.

22:43.423 --> 22:47.587
Assassination method:
Explosive teddy bears.

22:47.719 --> 22:50.174
That's all the KGB female assassins.

22:50.304 --> 22:54.765
You know, we could try freelancers
stationed outside the Soviet bloc.

22:54.893 --> 22:58.724
It'll have to wait. M wants you
out at the Blayden safe house.

22:59.898 --> 23:02.768
Right. Looks like
it's a dead end here anyway.

23:03.526 --> 23:04.937
Ah! Good!

23:20.836 --> 23:25.580
Something we're making for
the Americans. It's called a ghetto blaster.

23:26.716 --> 23:31.424
You'd better hurry. M wants you
to stop at Harrods and pick up a parcel.

23:32.764 --> 23:37.721
Moneypenny, ask Records to monitor
Czech publication and news services

23:37.851 --> 23:42.229
for any mention of a woman cellist
at the conservatoire in Bratislava.

23:42.648 --> 23:45.483
I didn't know
you were such a music lover, James.

23:45.609 --> 23:50.022
Any time you want to drop by and
listen to my Barry Manilow collection...

24:00.249 --> 24:03.036
- Sorry, sir. Excuse me.
- Bloody Yanks.

24:34.616 --> 24:36.656
Good morning, sir.

24:37.618 --> 24:39.861
Control here. 007's on his way.

24:52.885 --> 24:55.719
Sorry, Mr. Bond.
You'll have to leave the metal.

24:58.473 --> 24:59.932
Thank you, sir.

25:00.058 --> 25:03.094
- Good morning, sir. May I help you?
- No, thanks.

25:03.228 --> 25:05.267
They're in the drawing room.

25:11.152 --> 25:12.695
Come.

25:16.533 --> 25:18.276
James!

25:18.410 --> 25:21.944
James, I will never forget
what you did for me!

25:22.663 --> 25:24.704
Thank you so... What's this?

25:26.417 --> 25:30.165
From Harrods. A godsend!
The food here is horrible.

25:30.296 --> 25:33.250
- The foie gras is excellent.
- Da, da. As Russians say,

25:33.382 --> 25:37.083
hearts and stomachs
good comrades make.

25:37.219 --> 25:42.177
What's this? Caviar. Well, that's peasant
food for us, but with champagne it's OK.

25:42.308 --> 25:45.226
Bollinger RD. The best!

25:46.813 --> 25:50.644
The brand on the list was questionable,
sir, so I chose something else.

25:50.774 --> 25:52.768
Superb, Mr. Bond!

25:53.069 --> 25:55.394
May I suggest we resume the debriefing?

25:55.529 --> 25:57.855
Absolutely. Go ahead. I'm all yours.

26:04.831 --> 26:07.368
- Where's the usual milkman?
- What d'you say?

26:07.500 --> 26:10.500
- Where's the usual man?
- Flu.

26:19.178 --> 26:22.344
- Hey, mate. Watch it!
- Kitchen entrance, round the back.

26:22.723 --> 26:26.851
General Leonid Pushkin is why I defect.

26:26.977 --> 26:30.428
What? Your KGB superior?

26:30.564 --> 26:33.814
Gogol's replacement when
he joined their foreign service.

26:33.942 --> 26:37.810
Once we were like brothers,
but now he's a different man.

26:37.947 --> 26:41.067
Power has gone to his head.
He's sick, like Stalin!

26:41.199 --> 26:43.987
He hates our new policy of détente.

26:48.207 --> 26:54.790
I have here a secret directive
from Pushkin. Smiert Spionom.

26:56.215 --> 26:58.503
"Death to Spies", Minister.

26:58.968 --> 27:03.926
For an assassination program, with list
of targets - British and American agents.

27:04.891 --> 27:07.760
When this starts, you will retaliate.

27:07.893 --> 27:11.511
Soviet and Western Intelligence
could destroy each other.

27:11.647 --> 27:13.722
This might lead to nuclear war!

27:13.857 --> 27:17.142
Unless Pushkin can be...
How do you say?

27:18.403 --> 27:20.443
Put away.

27:22.156 --> 27:25.028
Where is Pushkin now? In Moscow?

27:25.160 --> 27:28.363
But in three days
he will leave for Tangier.

27:28.497 --> 27:32.495
Cover - North African trade convention.

27:34.419 --> 27:36.625
Real reason?

27:36.755 --> 27:38.794
New directive.

27:41.926 --> 27:46.884
Minister, in view of the importance
of what Mr. Koskov has just told us,

27:47.015 --> 27:49.932
I believe we should
consult with higher authority.

27:50.059 --> 27:54.187
- By all means. Good day, Mr. Koskov.
- Good day, sir.

28:00.570 --> 28:02.811
There you go. There's a good lad.

28:15.835 --> 28:19.085
- Good morning.
- Morning. Put it down there, would you?

28:19.214 --> 28:20.838
Ta.

28:32.894 --> 28:34.387
Green Four to base!

28:43.321 --> 28:46.191
Green Four, this is control.
Where are you?

29:18.856 --> 29:20.895
You may have a malfunction.

29:25.946 --> 29:29.029
Green Four to base.
We have gas leaks in main building.

29:29.157 --> 29:33.866
Some personnel overcome. Evacuate.
Send for emergency medical services.

29:34.371 --> 29:36.448
Green Four, I read and understand you.

29:36.582 --> 29:40.626
Control to all stations.
Code 10. Initiate emergency drill.

29:40.753 --> 29:44.881
Evacuate the main building.
Emergency. Emergency.

29:53.056 --> 29:57.635
Green Four to base. Major gas explosion.
Keep clear of the main building.

29:59.062 --> 30:00.722
KGB!

30:11.700 --> 30:12.898
Keep back!

30:15.161 --> 30:18.328
- Get up. Come on!
- Don't kill me! Don't kill me!

30:22.502 --> 30:24.828
Move. Move!

30:26.422 --> 30:29.792
Keep clear of the main building.

30:42.981 --> 30:45.187
- Who's that for?
- You, comrade.

30:45.316 --> 30:47.059
Help him or I kill you both.

30:55.409 --> 30:57.532
Move! Hurry.

30:57.662 --> 31:01.493
Only emergency services
should be allowed in the area.

31:11.551 --> 31:13.589
Stay away from the house.

31:17.348 --> 31:19.921
Please don't use
your private radiophones.

31:41.287 --> 31:45.831
Two dead, two in hospital, and Koskov
probably back in Moscow, if not dead.

31:45.959 --> 31:49.126
We're the laughing stock
of the Intelligence community.

31:49.254 --> 31:54.593
Our first major coup in years, snatched
from right under our noses by the KGB

31:54.718 --> 31:56.758
only hours after he defected!

31:56.888 --> 31:58.926
- No trace of him?
- Nothing.

31:59.056 --> 32:03.220
- Then there's this Pushkin matter.
- Well, I must be off.

32:03.352 --> 32:05.640
Meeting with the PM this afternoon.

32:08.858 --> 32:11.395
We have to nip
Smiert Spionom in the bud.

32:13.236 --> 32:16.487
Pushkin should be in Tangiers
in two days' time.

32:16.615 --> 32:19.153
A termination warrant
has been issued for him.

32:19.284 --> 32:23.033
This plot to kill agents
sounds rather far-fetched, sir.

32:23.872 --> 32:26.327
- I know General Pushkin.
- Do you think I don't?

32:26.458 --> 32:29.375
I've dealt with him on several occasions!

32:29.503 --> 32:34.877
Our paths have crossed over the years.
He's tough and resourceful, but...

32:35.008 --> 32:39.255
- I can't believe he's a psychotic.
- Neither did I until today.

32:39.387 --> 32:43.136
This arrived from Gibraltar.
It was found near 004's body.

32:48.147 --> 32:50.851
Your name was on Pushkin's list, too, 007.

32:54.778 --> 33:00.282
There are a few things I'd like to check
out first, sir. That sniper, for instance.

33:00.408 --> 33:04.157
Yes. I've read Saunders' report.
You jeopardized the mission

33:04.287 --> 33:10.159
- To avoid shooting a beautiful girl.
- I had to make a split-second decision.

33:10.293 --> 33:12.961
- It was instinct.
- I'll recall 008 from Hong Kong.

33:13.087 --> 33:15.495
He can do it. He doesn't know Pushkin.

33:15.632 --> 33:18.835
He follows orders, not instincts.

33:19.260 --> 33:22.095
- You can take a fortnight's leave.
- No!

33:22.639 --> 33:24.678
Sir.

33:25.849 --> 33:30.512
If it has to be done, I'd rather do it.

33:33.690 --> 33:36.443
Right, bring it down slowly. Gently now.

33:36.569 --> 33:39.439
- Morning, Q.
- Ah, morning, 007.

33:39.572 --> 33:41.814
Mind your head.

33:41.949 --> 33:45.649
I've got something for you.
We're just winterizing this.

33:48.415 --> 33:51.035
Now, pay attention, 007.

33:51.167 --> 33:53.621
A key-ring finder.

33:55.004 --> 33:58.669
- Surprise me.
- You arm it by pressing that button there.

33:58.799 --> 34:00.756
Like that. See?

34:02.386 --> 34:04.426
Right. Now wear that.

34:06.181 --> 34:09.800
Right. Now whistle
the first bars of "Rule, Britannia".

34:21.071 --> 34:25.199
Stun gas. Effective range?
Ooh, about five feet.

34:25.992 --> 34:30.156
Disorientates any normal person
for about, ooh, 30 seconds.

34:30.289 --> 34:34.036
You don't find too many
normal people in this business, Q.

34:34.168 --> 34:37.038
What is it to blow up the room -
"God Save the Queen"?

34:37.170 --> 34:42.081
It so happens, 007, that we've packed
the finder with concentrated explosive,

34:42.217 --> 34:44.625
sufficient to remove the door of any safe.

34:44.762 --> 34:49.222
It's magnetic.
The actuating signal is personalized.

34:49.349 --> 34:51.840
- What's my code?
- Oh, most appropriate.

34:52.143 --> 34:54.978
- A wolf whistle.
- You mean, um...

34:56.065 --> 34:58.103
Stop!

34:59.317 --> 35:01.643
You may find the keys useful.

35:02.654 --> 35:05.144
They open 90% of the world's locks.

35:07.993 --> 35:11.159
All right, sit down and
make yourself comfortable.

35:15.709 --> 35:19.753
- Well done, Moneypenny. That's her.
- Records sent over this translation.

35:19.879 --> 35:22.549
"Kara Milovy,
talented scholarship cellist,

35:22.674 --> 35:26.291
whose arm was injured
during an intermission last week,

35:26.427 --> 35:28.551
will be at the academy on Thursday,

35:28.680 --> 35:31.716
playing Borodin's
'String Quartet No. 2 in D'."

35:31.850 --> 35:34.555
That's tomorrow.

35:34.686 --> 35:40.273
Moneypenny, I'll need travel documents
for Tangier via Bratislava.

35:40.401 --> 35:42.891
And keep this between ourselves.

35:43.027 --> 35:45.434
That girl must be very talented.

35:45.571 --> 35:49.569
Believe me, my interest in her
is purely professional.

35:49.700 --> 35:53.995
- Just taking the Aston Martin for a spin.
- Be careful, 007.

35:54.122 --> 35:56.198
It's just had a new coat of paint!

40:14.421 --> 40:16.876
I dropped the gun in the river.

40:20.594 --> 40:23.049
The KGB made quite a mess.

40:24.848 --> 40:27.304
You're English. Who are you?

40:28.352 --> 40:31.887
I heard you play
at the conservatoire yesterday.

40:35.900 --> 40:38.522
It was exquisite.

40:38.904 --> 40:42.568
I saw what happened on the tram.
Where did they take you?

40:45.201 --> 40:47.241
KGB headquarters?

40:48.829 --> 40:50.952
They released me this morning.

40:51.082 --> 40:53.655
Take a look across the street.

40:57.171 --> 41:00.089
They let you go so they could follow you.

41:05.972 --> 41:09.506
I don't understand.
Why are you trying to help me?

41:12.395 --> 41:15.230
What did Pushkin want?

41:15.356 --> 41:18.725
Did he ask you about Georgi Koskov?

41:22.238 --> 41:24.277
He wanted to know where he was.

41:24.408 --> 41:27.491
- Did you tell him?
- No.

41:27.618 --> 41:30.287
That was clever of Georgi, using blanks.

41:33.207 --> 41:36.657
Made the British believe
his defection was real.

41:36.793 --> 41:39.001
How do you know that?

41:39.130 --> 41:41.501
He told me.

41:41.632 --> 41:44.917
- You saw him?
- Two days ago. He's safe and sound.

41:47.346 --> 41:51.558
- You're a friend of his?
- We've been through quite a lot together.

41:53.602 --> 41:57.896
Dear Georgi!
He kept his promise to send for me.

41:59.233 --> 42:01.059
Where are we going? To London?

42:01.193 --> 42:05.985
No, not yet. The British think
he'll be safer if he keeps moving around.

42:06.115 --> 42:09.530
- We might catch up with him in Vienna.
- Vienna?

42:09.659 --> 42:13.443
We must leave immediately,
before they pick you up again.

42:13.580 --> 42:15.620
- But how?
- We'll manage.

42:15.749 --> 42:18.121
Get packed. Bring some warm clothes.

43:23.232 --> 43:25.688
Looks like we got away with it.

43:29.029 --> 43:31.735
My cello! It's at the conservatoire.

43:31.867 --> 43:35.116
- I'll get you another in Vienna.
- No, we must go back for it.

43:35.244 --> 43:38.660
We have 10 minutes before
they discover what's happened.

43:38.790 --> 43:41.660
- I must get my cello.
- No way!

43:57.975 --> 44:00.015
Come on, get in!

44:03.648 --> 44:05.973
Why didn't you learn the violin?

44:38.015 --> 44:40.173
You've picked up the police band.

44:40.309 --> 44:42.846
There must be an atmospheric anomaly.

44:46.356 --> 44:50.141
They're looking for a foreign car.
A man and a woman.

44:50.277 --> 44:51.985
And a cello!

44:57.534 --> 45:00.286
Looks like they just found us.

45:13.675 --> 45:16.381
Pull over to the side and stop!

45:35.196 --> 45:37.818
- What happened?
- Salt corrosion.

45:43.121 --> 45:45.160
They're setting up roadblocks.

46:08.812 --> 46:12.016
- What is this?
- I've had a few optional extras installed.

46:37.591 --> 46:39.880
Amazing, this modern safety glass.

46:41.428 --> 46:42.627
Look out!

46:54.066 --> 46:55.976
See where this leads to.

46:58.988 --> 47:01.026
This road only leads to the lake.

47:26.306 --> 47:28.346
Time to leave.

48:04.969 --> 48:06.547
James!

48:30.870 --> 48:32.696
Brace yourself.

49:03.111 --> 49:04.190
We almost made it.

49:10.368 --> 49:12.406
Come on, quick! Go!

49:24.589 --> 49:27.128
Glad I insisted you brought that cello!

50:05.630 --> 50:07.423
Sorry!

50:10.302 --> 50:12.045
Not far now!

50:21.104 --> 50:23.430
Here, wave this.

50:26.609 --> 50:28.649
Duck!

50:28.778 --> 50:32.277
- We've nothing to declare!
- Just a cello!

50:39.330 --> 50:41.869
TANGIER

51:22.081 --> 51:25.165
If you wait here, sir, I'll find the chief.

51:44.352 --> 51:46.845
General Pushkin, it's a pleasure.

51:46.981 --> 51:50.480
I'm Brad Whitaker.
Didn't expect to see you in Tangiers.

51:50.609 --> 51:52.981
General Koskov with you?

51:53.738 --> 51:57.106
War. War has always been
man's main occupation.

51:57.240 --> 52:01.239
Fools say his greatest accomplishments
were the wheel and the alphabet.

52:01.370 --> 52:03.695
I say it's a battering ram and gunpowder.

52:03.831 --> 52:06.618
How do you like my pantheon
of great commanders?

52:06.751 --> 52:09.917
- Butchers.
- Surgeons.

52:10.045 --> 52:14.173
They cut away society's dead flesh.
Let me show you something.

52:14.300 --> 52:16.422
At ease, Sergeant. This way, sir.

52:19.179 --> 52:23.925
My hobby-the strategy and tactics
of the world's historic battles.

52:26.937 --> 52:30.187
Afghanistan,
the North-West Frontier, 1895.

52:30.315 --> 52:33.435
The initial trial of the first
automatic machine gun.

52:33.569 --> 52:35.775
The.303-caliber Maxim.

52:35.905 --> 52:39.355
The King's Royal Rifles
wiped out a vastly superior force.

52:39.492 --> 52:42.741
Kept the British in Afghanistan
for another 25 years.

52:42.869 --> 52:46.998
What you Russians need nowadays
is the equivalent of a modern Maxim.

52:48.000 --> 52:50.122
Third-generation starlight scope.

52:50.251 --> 52:54.878
A laser-sighting, short-barreled
machine pistol. Infantry mini-missiles.

52:55.007 --> 52:58.671
Range - 5km.
And smart. Just fire and forget.

52:58.801 --> 53:01.506
It penetrates all existing armor.

53:01.638 --> 53:04.175
Yes, sir! Samples of everything ordered.

53:04.306 --> 53:06.846
The order is cancelled.

53:06.977 --> 53:10.808
You'll return our deposit
of $50 million within the next 48 hours.

53:10.939 --> 53:12.978
You can't be serious, General.

53:13.108 --> 53:15.978
Do you know how hard it is
to obtain this equipment?

53:16.111 --> 53:18.518
This is the latest US and European stuff.

53:18.654 --> 53:22.189
I've made commitments,
letters of credit, special payoffs.

53:22.325 --> 53:26.453
We know that you've had our money
in your Swiss account for eight weeks

53:26.580 --> 53:29.200
and that you have made
no payments of any kind.

53:29.332 --> 53:32.084
Look, I can't cancel
orders at this late date.

53:32.209 --> 53:35.246
As one soldier to another,
you have my word of honor...

53:35.380 --> 53:40.421
Spare me your military pretensions.
What army did you serve in?

53:40.551 --> 53:43.505
You were expelled
from West Point for cheating.

53:44.221 --> 53:47.556
Then a short stint as
a mercenary in the Belgian Congo.

53:47.684 --> 53:52.225
Later you worked with various criminals
to help finance your first arms deals.

53:52.355 --> 53:55.309
Lies spread by my competitors.

53:55.441 --> 53:58.477
You forget your many
so-called wars of liberation

53:58.611 --> 54:02.774
that I have supplied through General
Koskov. Those are my credentials.

54:02.907 --> 54:08.068
The money in two days, or you'll find
yourself out of business permanently.

54:08.203 --> 54:10.659
Georgi Koskov as well.

54:11.499 --> 54:14.369
I don't know what you two are scheming,

54:14.502 --> 54:17.787
but it is over. Is that understood?

54:24.095 --> 54:26.134
Careful.

54:38.776 --> 54:40.318
Taxi!

54:48.743 --> 54:51.780
Vienna's beautiful, just like Georgi said.

54:51.915 --> 54:55.828
- You care for him a great deal, don't you?
- I owe him everything.

54:55.960 --> 55:00.040
My scholarship
at the conservatoire, my Strad.

55:00.171 --> 55:04.963
- Your cello's a Stradivarius?
- A famous one. The Lady Rose.

55:05.094 --> 55:07.929
- Georgi got it in New York.
- Quite a present.

55:08.429 --> 55:12.049
Maybe someday I'll play there.
At Carnegie Hall?

55:12.184 --> 55:15.802
- Georgi believes I can do it.
- I'm sure he's right.

55:17.063 --> 55:20.563
- We go to him now?
- Yeah. Unless he had to move on.

55:21.860 --> 55:24.564
If he did, I'm sure he left a message.

56:08.781 --> 56:10.821
- Careful.
- Careful.

56:21.460 --> 56:23.418
Good afternoon, Mr. Bond.

56:23.546 --> 56:27.129
- You will need your usual suite?
- Not tonight, Hans.

56:27.258 --> 56:29.297
- We need a second bedroom.
- Yes, sir.

56:29.426 --> 56:33.009
- Shall I have vodka martinis sent up?
- Shaken, not stirred.

56:33.139 --> 56:35.178
Of course.

56:40.187 --> 56:41.385
Universal Exports.

56:41.522 --> 56:46.599
Bond here. I need two tickets for the
opera tonight, to be left at the box office.

57:00.165 --> 57:04.079
- Do you like it?
- For princess or wife of commissar?

57:04.211 --> 57:06.619
- Let's buy it.
- Don't joke!

57:06.756 --> 57:09.875
- Who will pay?
- Georgi, of course.

57:32.656 --> 57:34.695
The chief wants you.

57:49.756 --> 57:51.796
We have to report.

58:04.270 --> 58:06.512
Very good. At ease, Sergeant.

58:08.232 --> 58:10.272
Pushkin wants the money back.

58:11.403 --> 58:16.644
Don't worry. We've convinced
the British that Pushkin is a danger.

58:16.782 --> 58:20.946
They will send their best man,
James Bond, to eliminate him.

58:21.078 --> 58:23.867
I'm not convinced. Necros can do it.

58:23.998 --> 58:27.995
I've worked with the Russians.
My appearance is well known to them.

58:28.127 --> 58:31.497
It could jeopardize my comrades
who depend upon me.

58:31.632 --> 58:36.091
And they depend upon me. Where else
will they find a supply of arms?

58:36.218 --> 58:38.295
Our basic plan is sound.

58:38.430 --> 58:41.299
Pushkin is, how you say, history.

58:41.432 --> 58:44.219
Not yet. James Bond
hasn't laid a finger on him.

58:44.352 --> 58:46.428
- The British are cautious.
- Yeah.

58:46.562 --> 58:49.765
An additional inducement will ensure this.

58:49.898 --> 58:53.766
For instance,
if another agent were eliminated.

58:55.905 --> 59:00.116
Do it. But if Pushkin is alive on
the last day of the conference, kill him!

59:53.795 --> 59:57.046
- All my life I've dreamed of this.
- You might play here one day.

59:57.174 --> 01:00:01.301
That's too much to hope for.
Excuse me for a few moments.

01:00:10.729 --> 01:00:12.638
- Is that?
- The cello girl.

01:00:12.772 --> 01:00:16.022
- The KGB sniper? Why bring her here?
- She's not a KGB sniper.

01:00:16.151 --> 01:00:19.069
She's Koskov's girlfriend.

01:00:19.196 --> 01:00:22.280
She shot blanks to make
his defection look real to us.

01:00:22.407 --> 01:00:25.610
Koskov's defection phony?
The KGB snatched him back.

01:00:25.744 --> 01:00:28.412
That's what we were supposed to think.

01:00:28.537 --> 01:00:33.283
These are serious accusations, Bond.
What are you up to?

01:00:33.418 --> 01:00:37.463
I'm posing as Koskov's friend
to see what leads I can get from her.

01:00:39.675 --> 01:00:43.755
You know he bought her a cello
in New York called the Lady Rose?

01:00:43.887 --> 01:00:47.801
- A cello with a name?
- It's a Stradivarius.

01:00:47.932 --> 01:00:50.139
They all have names.

01:00:50.268 --> 01:00:52.972
Where would Koskov
get the money? Check it out.

01:00:53.104 --> 01:00:58.728
I'll need papers for her tonight. I have
to get her out of the country by tomorrow.

01:00:58.860 --> 01:01:01.777
Here. I took these this afternoon.

01:01:02.238 --> 01:01:06.022
Look, this is highly irregular.
I won't get the OK from London today.

01:01:06.159 --> 01:01:11.865
It can't wait, Saunders. That girl's
our only chance of getting Koskov back.

01:01:18.296 --> 01:01:22.792
Very well.
I've got nothing to lose but my pension.

01:01:22.926 --> 01:01:28.429
Meet me at the Prater Café
near the Ferris wheel at midnight.

01:01:56.125 --> 01:01:58.581
- No more.
- This one!

01:02:18.063 --> 01:02:20.020
Take me on the wheel.

01:02:41.502 --> 01:02:43.792
You'll be able to see better.

01:02:58.937 --> 01:03:01.725
Is it real or just a dream?

01:03:22.461 --> 01:03:24.702
What's wrong? Why do we stop?

01:03:26.881 --> 01:03:28.921
I arranged it.

01:03:29.050 --> 01:03:31.090
We could be here all night.

01:03:37.892 --> 01:03:39.470
Don't.

01:03:39.602 --> 01:03:41.844
It's impossible.

01:03:41.980 --> 01:03:46.772
Knowing you only two days and all I can
think of is how we would be together.

01:03:49.362 --> 01:03:51.236
Don't think.

01:03:51.364 --> 01:03:53.403
Just let it happen.

01:04:29.402 --> 01:04:31.773
Do you want another ride?

01:04:45.167 --> 01:04:48.951
I'll be back in a minute.
There may be a message for me.

01:05:09.191 --> 01:05:12.974
It was bought recently
at auction in New York.

01:05:13.111 --> 01:05:18.532
Lot 124, the Lady Rose,
a cello by Stradivarius of Cremona, 1724.

01:05:18.658 --> 01:05:21.446
Sold for $150,000

01:05:22.830 --> 01:05:24.821
to Brad Whitaker.

01:05:24.956 --> 01:05:27.246
Whitaker? The arms dealer?

01:05:27.376 --> 01:05:29.415
The same.

01:05:30.253 --> 01:05:32.292
Koskov and Whitaker.

01:05:34.842 --> 01:05:37.877
- Where's Whitaker now?
- At his place in Tangier.

01:05:39.970 --> 01:05:42.178
Well done.

01:05:44.434 --> 01:05:46.473
Good luck.

01:05:46.895 --> 01:05:48.305
Saunders.

01:05:50.273 --> 01:05:52.146
Thanks.

01:06:28.769 --> 01:06:30.893
Where are you going?

01:06:42.617 --> 01:06:44.656
What's the matter?

01:06:46.746 --> 01:06:49.415
Bad accident back there.

01:06:49.540 --> 01:06:52.374
Did you hear?

01:06:52.501 --> 01:06:54.541
Hear from Georgi?

01:06:58.257 --> 01:07:00.297
Yes.

01:07:00.843 --> 01:07:03.085
I got the message.

01:07:05.973 --> 01:07:09.721
He's with Whitaker in Tangier.

01:07:09.852 --> 01:07:12.887
Brad Whitaker? The American?

01:07:13.021 --> 01:07:15.560
- You know him?
- He's a patron of the arts.

01:07:15.690 --> 01:07:18.692
Georgi said he'd help me.

01:07:18.819 --> 01:07:21.275
How soon do we have to go?

01:07:23.199 --> 01:07:27.244
Immediately. I promised Georgi
I'd get you back as soon as I could.

01:07:27.370 --> 01:07:29.527
Can't we stay here a few days?

01:07:29.663 --> 01:07:32.236
No. We leave first thing in the morning.

01:09:47.210 --> 01:09:49.249
Is anything wrong?

01:09:52.006 --> 01:09:55.173
- Bond!
- Don't make any sudden moves, General.

01:09:56.093 --> 01:09:58.133
Go to the table.

01:10:16.905 --> 01:10:18.944
Sit down.

01:10:29.208 --> 01:10:32.327
I take it that this is not a social call, 007.

01:10:32.461 --> 01:10:35.545
Correct. You should have brought lilies.

01:10:38.425 --> 01:10:41.260
- May I ask why?
- Smiert Spionom.

01:10:44.472 --> 01:10:49.632
That was a Beria operation in Stalin's
time. It was deactivated 20 years ago.

01:10:49.769 --> 01:10:53.054
- Two of our agents are dead.
- My condolences.

01:10:53.189 --> 01:10:55.264
We had nothing to do with it.

01:11:00.779 --> 01:11:02.653
Where's Koskov?

01:11:02.781 --> 01:11:07.074
He disappeared two weeks ago.
I was about to have him arrested.

01:11:07.202 --> 01:11:10.653
- Why?
- For misusing state funds.

01:11:11.247 --> 01:11:13.121
Involving Whitaker?

01:11:13.249 --> 01:11:16.285
That is a security matter
and cannot be discussed.

01:11:19.463 --> 01:11:21.835
That was damn stupid!

01:11:40.525 --> 01:11:43.098
Get in the bathroom and lock the door.

01:11:47.906 --> 01:11:49.946
Stay where you are!

01:11:53.161 --> 01:11:55.201
Get down on your knees.

01:11:58.083 --> 01:12:00.122
Put your hands behind your back.

01:12:02.503 --> 01:12:06.371
You are professional.
You do not kill without reason.

01:12:06.507 --> 01:12:09.259
Two of our men are dead.
Koskov's named you.

01:12:10.386 --> 01:12:15.344
- Now, why should I disobey my orders?
- I am in the dark as much as you are.

01:12:15.474 --> 01:12:19.424
It is a question of trust.
Who do you believe?

01:12:19.561 --> 01:12:21.850
Koskov or me?

01:12:21.980 --> 01:12:25.265
If I trusted Koskov,
we wouldn't be talking.

01:12:27.193 --> 01:12:31.902
But as long as you're alive,
we'll never know what he's up to.

01:12:38.579 --> 01:12:40.287
Then I must die.

01:12:41.415 --> 01:12:42.909
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:12:43.041 --> 01:12:46.825
it is my honor to introduce
the head of the Russian delegation,

01:12:46.962 --> 01:12:49.001
Comrade Leonid Pushkin.

01:13:00.433 --> 01:13:02.141
Comrade delegates,

01:13:02.268 --> 01:13:07.475
I bring you profound fraternal greetings
from your comrades in Soviet Union.

01:13:34.798 --> 01:13:36.506
Seal the building!

01:15:00.003 --> 01:15:03.917
- You looking for a party?
- Seems like a good idea.

01:15:07.927 --> 01:15:10.596
I'm sorry to put you
through that, my dear.

01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:20.436
It is the first time I've ever been grateful
that James Bond is a good shot!

01:15:22.900 --> 01:15:27.645
Pull over here. We can have a party
some other time. A little present for you.

01:15:31.074 --> 01:15:33.991
Not enough? Take it all.

01:15:39.832 --> 01:15:42.833
Just sit back and enjoy the ride.

01:16:07.275 --> 01:16:09.314
Down below.

01:16:13.322 --> 01:16:17.616
What the hell are you trying to do, 007?
Start World War III?

01:16:17.743 --> 01:16:21.692
Felix Leiter!
Now, what's the CIA doing here?

01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:23.658
Nice work, girls.

01:16:23.790 --> 01:16:26.744
- No hard feelings?
- Not if the party's still on.

01:16:30.004 --> 01:16:35.081
It's a long story, Felix, but in the end
Pushkin makes a miraculous recovery.

01:16:35.217 --> 01:16:37.673
You mean this is a put-up job?

01:16:39.388 --> 01:16:42.223
- What's all this?
- We've been watching Pushkin

01:16:42.349 --> 01:16:44.425
since he met two days ago with Whitaker.

01:16:44.768 --> 01:16:48.219
- An illegal arms deal with the Russians?
- You've got me, James.

01:16:48.355 --> 01:16:53.431
Whitaker has a few samples of hi-tech
stuff, but he's placed no big orders yet.

01:16:53.568 --> 01:16:58.443
Looks like we're working on the same
case from opposite ends. Let's talk shop.

01:17:01.450 --> 01:17:02.446
Well done!

01:17:02.576 --> 01:17:05.150
Congratulations.
We heard it over the radio.

01:17:05.287 --> 01:17:08.039
I didn't kill him. Bond did.

01:17:08.957 --> 01:17:12.207
I told you the British believed me!
I told you!

01:17:12.336 --> 01:17:14.328
I told you!

01:17:14.463 --> 01:17:17.962
Now we can move. I'll signal
Amsterdam to ship the diamonds.

01:17:18.091 --> 01:17:20.712
- Sir?
- Hello? Yes.

01:17:22.428 --> 01:17:24.468
Who?

01:17:26.015 --> 01:17:28.054
It's for you.

01:17:32.521 --> 01:17:34.561
Hello?

01:17:58.712 --> 01:18:02.876
Where have you been, James?
You were gone so long, I was worried!

01:18:03.008 --> 01:18:07.504
It's always nice to be missed.
Still no sign of Georgi.

01:18:07.637 --> 01:18:09.677
- No, please. Go on playing.
- No.

01:18:11.683 --> 01:18:13.722
Let's have a drink.

01:18:23.944 --> 01:18:25.984
You remembered.

01:18:31.118 --> 01:18:33.443
To us.

01:18:33.578 --> 01:18:35.618
Nazdraviye.

01:18:39.209 --> 01:18:41.248
Did I get it right?

01:18:43.087 --> 01:18:45.127
Perfect.

01:18:46.174 --> 01:18:48.213
What's the matter?

01:18:52.221 --> 01:18:54.926
Kara, it's time I told you the truth.

01:18:56.725 --> 01:19:01.054
I'm not a friend of Georgi's.
I'm a British agent looking for him.

01:19:01.188 --> 01:19:06.644
He's betrayed us all, Kara.
The Russians, the British, even you.

01:19:09.070 --> 01:19:13.566
He told us a sniper might try to kill him.

01:19:13.699 --> 01:19:16.985
And he set you up as the sniper, Kara.

01:19:17.119 --> 01:19:20.618
He wants you dead. You knew too much.

01:19:20.748 --> 01:19:24.531
Liar! You pretended to love me!

01:19:24.668 --> 01:19:29.875
I telephoned Whitaker.
Georgi was there. He told me the truth.

01:19:30.006 --> 01:19:33.505
You're a KGB agent,
using me to find him and kill him!

01:19:33.635 --> 01:19:35.508
No, that's not...

01:19:35.637 --> 01:19:37.676
That's not true. I...

01:19:40.766 --> 01:19:42.177
That's...

01:19:44.186 --> 01:19:46.143
Chloral hydrate!

01:19:46.272 --> 01:19:49.272
- Keep your hands off me!
- Kara, listen to me!

01:19:52.361 --> 01:19:54.649
The rifle was shot out of your hands.

01:19:54.780 --> 01:19:57.235
- How do you know?
- Because I was the...

01:19:58.450 --> 01:20:00.941
I was the man sent to kill you.

01:20:02.412 --> 01:20:04.903
Why didn't you?

01:20:18.135 --> 01:20:21.717
Kara, my darling,
you were absolutely perfect.

01:20:23.306 --> 01:20:24.717
Hurry.

01:21:09.266 --> 01:21:11.305
Open it, please.

01:21:12.769 --> 01:21:15.343
Careful. It must be kept absolutely sterile.

01:21:16.690 --> 01:21:18.729
Urgh! Go.

01:22:11.950 --> 01:22:14.571
I've been such a fool.

01:22:15.787 --> 01:22:18.112
We both have.

01:22:18.247 --> 01:22:20.287
Open the lid.

01:22:21.626 --> 01:22:22.705
Oh, my God!

01:22:22.835 --> 01:22:25.587
That's not human. It's an animal's heart.

01:22:29.967 --> 01:22:32.967
Diamonds hidden in the ice.

01:22:36.973 --> 01:22:41.184
- How can I help you?
- I need my key ring. Look out!

01:23:07.335 --> 01:23:09.624
Black coffee for our guest.

01:23:12.590 --> 01:23:15.211
She has so many talents!

01:23:15.343 --> 01:23:17.335
I'm curious.

01:23:17.470 --> 01:23:20.838
- Why didn't you kill me?
- Oh, I'm not a barbarian, James.

01:23:20.973 --> 01:23:23.724
I'm taking you
to the proper Soviet authorities

01:23:23.851 --> 01:23:26.970
for the killing of General Pushkin.

01:23:30.231 --> 01:23:35.273
You're a wonder, Georgi!
You get me to kill Pushkin for you.

01:23:35.403 --> 01:23:38.439
Then you turn me in
to the Russians for his murder.

01:23:38.573 --> 01:23:42.238
What are you going to ask for? Immunity?

01:23:42.368 --> 01:23:46.200
Permission to emigrate
and enjoy the amenities of the West?

01:23:46.330 --> 01:23:49.331
You don't think they'll
condone your defection?

01:23:49.458 --> 01:23:51.082
What defection?

01:23:51.209 --> 01:23:54.459
I have been on a secret mission
for General Pushkin

01:23:54.588 --> 01:23:58.206
to disinform British Intelligence.

01:23:58.341 --> 01:24:02.588
I'm sorry, James.
For you I have great affection,

01:24:02.720 --> 01:24:07.181
but we have an old saying:
"Duty has no sweethearts."

01:24:09.101 --> 01:24:12.268
We have an old saying, too, Georgi.

01:24:12.396 --> 01:24:14.803
And you're full of it!

01:24:38.379 --> 01:24:40.418
Come, Kara.

01:24:51.057 --> 01:24:53.809
- Kara?
- Yes.

01:25:00.274 --> 01:25:02.516
Welcome to Afghanistan.

01:25:02.651 --> 01:25:05.438
Colonel Feyador,
my old comrade in arms.

01:25:07.156 --> 01:25:13.276
I have here General Pushkin's assassin.
British Agent 007, James Bond.

01:25:13.412 --> 01:25:16.578
See he is sent to Moscow.

01:25:16.706 --> 01:25:19.078
One moment. There's one more.

01:25:19.209 --> 01:25:22.293
Take her, too. She's a defector.

01:25:24.672 --> 01:25:26.748
I will be compassionate with you

01:25:26.883 --> 01:25:31.046
and try to have you assigned to
the Siberian Philharmonic Orchestra.

01:25:31.178 --> 01:25:34.713
They're quite good
despite their bourgeois repertoire.

01:25:42.647 --> 01:25:47.724
I am on a secret state mission. I need
a detachment of men and some trucks.

01:25:54.325 --> 01:25:56.531
- What are these here for?
- For murder.

01:25:56.660 --> 01:25:58.700
Murder?

01:25:59.705 --> 01:26:03.619
I haven't had a woman prisoner
for a long time!

01:26:07.295 --> 01:26:09.869
Come.

01:26:10.006 --> 01:26:13.007
Russky! Has Colonel Feyador
considered my appeal?

01:26:13.134 --> 01:26:15.091
Yes. Good news.

01:26:15.219 --> 01:26:18.553
You won't be hung in the morning.
You will be shot!

01:26:21.309 --> 01:26:23.681
It's all a mistake! I stole nothing!

01:26:23.811 --> 01:26:26.266
You can tell Allah when you see him!

01:26:29.233 --> 01:26:32.601
- Strip!
- Nye smeyete menya trogat!

01:26:32.736 --> 01:26:38.074
Shout all you want. It's soundproofed.
They don't like to hear screaming at night.

01:26:39.409 --> 01:26:42.113
I didn't tell you to get down!

01:26:44.997 --> 01:26:47.405
I did not tell you to get up!

01:26:47.541 --> 01:26:49.581
Now get up!

01:28:13.205 --> 01:28:15.778
Lock the door.

01:28:18.251 --> 01:28:21.620
You were fantastic! We're free!

01:28:21.755 --> 01:28:27.294
Kara, we're in a Russian air base in the
middle of Afghanistan. Try the small key.

01:28:31.347 --> 01:28:33.553
At least we're together.

01:28:33.683 --> 01:28:35.722
Terrific. Come on.

01:28:43.901 --> 01:28:46.059
Please.

01:30:25.454 --> 01:30:27.696
Come on, jump!

01:30:40.677 --> 01:30:43.132
- What's going on?
- I tell them you no Russian.

01:30:43.262 --> 01:30:45.634
- They no kill you now.
- How about later?

01:30:45.765 --> 01:30:49.430
Don't worry.
They'll save you for the harem!

01:31:11.789 --> 01:31:14.161
It's the work of the mujaheddin.

01:31:14.291 --> 01:31:15.951
Mujaheddin?

01:31:16.085 --> 01:31:18.124
The Afghan Resistance.

01:32:56.262 --> 01:32:58.718
I hope he's not invited to dinner.

01:33:24.622 --> 01:33:29.533
Thank you both for your help.
My name is Kamran Shah.

01:33:29.668 --> 01:33:34.295
Please forgive the theatricals.
It's a hangover from my Oxford days.

01:33:34.423 --> 01:33:36.546
I'm sure you'd like to freshen up.

01:33:38.552 --> 01:33:40.591
It's all right, go ahead.

01:33:49.771 --> 01:33:53.934
- I have to get back to the air base.
- You must be crazy!

01:33:54.066 --> 01:33:58.443
- Half the Russian army's looking for you!
- You won't help?

01:33:58.570 --> 01:34:01.026
No.

01:34:01.156 --> 01:34:03.481
Then put me in touch
with the mujaheddin.

01:34:07.829 --> 01:34:10.534
Deputy Commander
of the Eastern District.

01:34:10.665 --> 01:34:16.952
I was caught reconnoitering the air base.
Thankfully they didn't know who I was.

01:34:17.088 --> 01:34:19.543
Now, who are you?

01:34:20.091 --> 01:34:22.416
I work for the British government.

01:34:25.554 --> 01:34:27.926
We've uncovered a plot
by General Koskov

01:34:28.056 --> 01:34:31.306
to purchase American hi-tech weapons.

01:34:31.435 --> 01:34:35.302
Arms that could be used
against you and your men.

01:34:35.438 --> 01:34:39.483
That is important. You must go to
our commander in the Khyber Pass.

01:34:39.609 --> 01:34:44.567
That could take days. I have to get back
to the air base before Koskov leaves.

01:34:44.697 --> 01:34:48.695
Look, come with us tomorrow.
After our mission, I'll see what I can do.

01:34:48.826 --> 01:34:50.865
That'll be too late.

01:34:52.496 --> 01:34:55.069
- I need a gun and some guides.
- Impossible.

01:34:55.207 --> 01:34:57.958
I cannot spare men or the horses.

01:34:58.085 --> 01:35:02.212
And now it is time to rest.
We leave at sunrise.

01:35:16.477 --> 01:35:18.516
I was worried for you, James.

01:35:22.107 --> 01:35:24.147
What's going to happen to us?

01:35:27.571 --> 01:35:30.322
Kheista.

01:35:30.448 --> 01:35:32.488
What does that mean?

01:35:34.327 --> 01:35:36.900
It means beautiful in Afghan.

01:35:41.500 --> 01:35:44.335
We're with the mujaheddin.

01:35:44.461 --> 01:35:48.210
We leave with them in the morning
on some kind of operation.

01:35:48.340 --> 01:35:50.748
And you're going to the Khyber Pass.

01:35:50.884 --> 01:35:53.838
You're not coming with me?

01:35:53.970 --> 01:35:57.339
No. I'll catch up with you later.

01:35:57.474 --> 01:36:00.047
You're going back for Georgi, aren't you?

01:36:01.519 --> 01:36:04.722
- It's too dangerous. Don't go.
- I have to.

01:36:04.856 --> 01:36:08.022
You have to what? Get killed?

01:36:09.151 --> 01:36:11.938
- I won't wait for you.
- Fine.

01:36:12.071 --> 01:36:15.024
Then I'll have Kamran
send you direct to London.

01:36:15.157 --> 01:36:19.154
You dumb, stubborn, stupid...

01:36:25.792 --> 01:36:29.576
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Back end of horse!

01:36:29.712 --> 01:36:32.084
Are you calling me a horse's arse?

01:36:44.768 --> 01:36:46.926
I might never see you again.

01:36:50.398 --> 01:36:52.307
You will.

01:36:52.442 --> 01:36:54.481
I promise.

01:38:41.753 --> 01:38:45.501
Raw opium. Worth half a billion
dollars on the streets of New York.

01:39:00.312 --> 01:39:03.763
- What are you up to? Selling dope?
- Not so loud.

01:39:04.190 --> 01:39:06.681
- That's the chief of the Snow Leopards.
- Who?

01:39:06.818 --> 01:39:11.029
- The biggest opium dealer in the area.
- I've worked for them.

01:39:11.155 --> 01:39:14.820
I don't care if the Russians die
from my bullets or their opium!

01:39:14.950 --> 01:39:17.322
Besides, we need the money to buy arms.

01:39:20.038 --> 01:39:22.660
- Georgi!
- And the diamonds.

01:39:24.501 --> 01:39:27.786
He arranged for the Russians
to buy many hi-tech weapons.

01:39:27.921 --> 01:39:31.124
He's using the down payment
to buy this opium instead.

01:39:31.257 --> 01:39:36.548
He can turn a huge profit in days and
still provide the Russians with their arms.

01:39:36.679 --> 01:39:39.051
- Unless...
- Go on.

01:39:40.141 --> 01:39:41.932
If the opium never arrives.

01:39:42.059 --> 01:39:45.262
The Snow Leopard Brotherhood
are dangerous to cross.

01:39:45.396 --> 01:39:47.886
This is their biggest deal
since the invasion.

01:39:48.023 --> 01:39:50.181
You won't help?

01:39:52.778 --> 01:39:57.605
Perhaps. As long as nothing is done
till the Russians pay up and leave.

01:39:57.741 --> 01:40:00.741
Right. I'll need
some plastic explosives and a timer.

01:40:00.868 --> 01:40:02.908
I'll see what I can do.

01:41:41.504 --> 01:41:44.339
James is trapped. You must help him!

01:41:44.466 --> 01:41:48.084
- He'll have to take his chances.
- You owe him your life!

01:41:48.219 --> 01:41:51.552
- There's nothing more I can do.
- Yes, there is!

01:42:04.651 --> 01:42:06.691
Women!

01:43:58.967 --> 01:44:01.504
Wait here. We'll come back for you.

01:44:53.768 --> 01:44:55.392
Bond!

01:45:12.702 --> 01:45:15.324
Don't shoot! Don't destroy the plane.

01:47:02.764 --> 01:47:05.337
Block the runway!

01:48:08.701 --> 01:48:09.981
The tanker!

01:49:20.977 --> 01:49:22.969
Where is she?

01:49:29.944 --> 01:49:31.983
We have to stop him!

01:49:34.198 --> 01:49:35.193
Kara!

01:50:06.645 --> 01:50:08.684
James!

01:50:13.359 --> 01:50:14.901
James!

01:50:23.410 --> 01:50:26.494
Don't shoot! You'll hit the plane!

01:51:14.083 --> 01:51:15.707
- Kara!
- Oh, my God!

01:51:20.214 --> 01:51:21.756
Jump!

01:51:54.120 --> 01:51:56.243
Now that you're here, take over.

01:51:56.372 --> 01:51:59.990
- What?
- Hold this and keep it straight and level.

01:52:00.126 --> 01:52:02.165
- Where are you going?
- To defuse a bomb.

01:55:10.638 --> 01:55:12.298
No!

01:55:13.682 --> 01:55:14.845
Please!

01:56:32.131 --> 01:56:34.966
- What happened?
- He got the boot.

01:57:33.021 --> 01:57:34.813
Take over. Hold it steady.

01:57:34.940 --> 01:57:37.478
- Where are you going?
- To drop a bomb.

01:58:47.716 --> 01:58:49.756
What's the matter?

01:58:50.761 --> 01:58:52.800
We're losing fuel fast!

01:59:03.606 --> 01:59:06.856
I just hope we can make Pakistan.

01:59:28.922 --> 01:59:31.757
There's no place to put down.

01:59:34.844 --> 01:59:37.335
Go in the back.
Get in the Jeep. Quickly!

01:59:53.361 --> 01:59:55.603
Fasten your seat belt!

02:00:07.791 --> 02:00:08.906
Hold on!

02:00:30.521 --> 02:00:34.768
I know a great restaurant in Karachi.
We can just make dinner!

02:00:47.871 --> 02:00:52.034
Whitaker's on the ground floor.
Koskov is in an upstairs bedroom.

02:00:52.166 --> 02:00:54.408
Guard in the pool area near you.

02:00:56.379 --> 02:00:58.418
Guard clear. Proceed.

02:01:05.179 --> 02:01:06.756
Hold it.

02:01:08.307 --> 02:01:10.513
He's coming back.

02:01:13.270 --> 02:01:15.843
Go, James. Over and out.

02:01:16.272 --> 02:01:18.644
Well, he's in.

02:01:42.964 --> 02:01:47.044
Pickett's charge was up
Cemetery Ridge, not Little Round Top.

02:01:47.176 --> 02:01:50.592
I'm replaying the battle
as I would have fought it.

02:01:50.721 --> 02:01:53.342
Meade was tenacious
but he was cautious.

02:01:53.474 --> 02:01:56.391
He missed his chances
to crush Lee at Gettysburg.

02:01:56.518 --> 02:01:58.558
I've come for Koskov.

02:02:00.772 --> 02:02:05.019
Well, hell, you can have him!
Soon as I get my opium.

02:02:05.151 --> 02:02:08.437
- Now where is it?
- Up in smoke.

02:02:09.572 --> 02:02:12.656
You burned up a half a billion bucks?

02:02:15.745 --> 02:02:18.070
That's too bad, Bond.

02:02:18.205 --> 02:02:22.914
You know, you could have been a live,
rich man instead of a poor, dead one.

02:02:23.043 --> 02:02:28.120
You're finished, Whitaker. If the Russians
don't get you, the Americans will.

02:02:28.423 --> 02:02:30.416
Nah.

02:02:30.550 --> 02:02:34.762
You know, Meade should have
taken another 35,000 casualties.

02:02:35.555 --> 02:02:37.927
He could have ended
the rebellion right then.

02:02:38.057 --> 02:02:40.050
Hell, Grant would have done it.

02:03:08.711 --> 02:03:11.878
Right, you've had your eight.
Now I'll have my 80!

02:03:17.219 --> 02:03:21.299
Sorry to say your popgun is no match
for the latest body armor!

02:03:51.459 --> 02:03:57.497
Should have known you'd take refuge
behind that British vulture Wellington!

02:04:00.635 --> 02:04:05.877
You know he had to buy German
mercenaries to beat Napoleon, don't you?

02:04:29.287 --> 02:04:31.326
I owed you that one, Bond.

02:04:35.417 --> 02:04:38.537
He met his Waterloo.

02:04:42.507 --> 02:04:44.334
General Pushkin!

02:04:45.510 --> 02:04:47.550
Thank God you're still alive!

02:04:50.473 --> 02:04:55.598
Whitaker has held me here for weeks.
Thank you for rescuing me! Thank you!

02:04:58.147 --> 02:05:00.602
Georgi! Georgi!

02:05:03.902 --> 02:05:07.401
- Put him on the next plane to Moscow.
- Oh, thank you, General!

02:05:07.531 --> 02:05:09.737
Thank you so much! Thank you!

02:05:09.866 --> 02:05:12.238
In the diplomatic bag.

02:05:19.751 --> 02:05:21.624
What about Kara?

02:05:21.752 --> 02:05:23.792
She is a defector, too.

02:05:25.131 --> 02:05:27.170
What shall we do about her?

02:06:25.312 --> 02:06:28.147
Are you going to stay in France now?

02:06:29.649 --> 02:06:32.354
Oh, you were marvelous!

02:06:33.528 --> 02:06:35.567
Will you excuse us?

02:06:39.617 --> 02:06:41.989
General Gogol, Miss Kara Milovy.

02:06:43.663 --> 02:06:49.036
Magnificent! I hope you can find time
to play in Moscow very soon.

02:06:49.168 --> 02:06:52.667
It's all right. General Gogol
is with their foreign service.

02:06:52.796 --> 02:06:57.588
He's arranged an immigration visa,
so you can come and go as you like.

02:06:57.717 --> 02:06:59.793
Wonderful!

02:07:03.890 --> 02:07:04.969
Excuse me.

02:07:07.226 --> 02:07:11.140
I'm sorry we missed the concert.
We had some trouble at the airport.

02:07:11.272 --> 02:07:16.230
I can't imagine why! General Gogol,
I don't believe you've met Kamran Shah.

02:07:16.360 --> 02:07:18.981
- My pleasure.
- Where's James?

02:07:19.112 --> 02:07:24.237
- Unhappily, he's on assignment abroad.
- I'll be with you shortly.

02:07:54.896 --> 02:07:58.265
You didn't think I'd miss
this performance, did you?

02:08:10.202 --> 02:08:11.482
Oh, James.
