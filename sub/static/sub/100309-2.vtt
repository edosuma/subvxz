WEBVTT

00:01.230 --> 00:03.070
Previously on "Manifest"...

00:03.070 --> 00:04.230
Save the passengers.

00:04.230 --> 00:05.940
Grace: I'm pregnant.

00:05.940 --> 00:07.400
I just thought this would be
something special

00:07.400 --> 00:08.740
to bring us all together

00:08.740 --> 00:10.950
when everything else
is so scary.

00:10.950 --> 00:12.950
NSA, drop your weapon!

00:16.080 --> 00:18.080
Somebody help me!

00:18.080 --> 00:19.580
You're Dr. Saanvi Bahl,
right?

00:19.580 --> 00:21.250
I'm sorry. And you are...?
Troy Davis.

00:21.250 --> 00:23.170
Oncology lab tech.

00:23.170 --> 00:25.050
I have an appointment...
with a therapist.

00:25.050 --> 00:27.130
Michaela and I,
we're meant to be together.

00:29.010 --> 00:30.760
Back off!

00:32.430 --> 00:34.470
Where's Zeke?
NYPD's looking for him.

00:34.470 --> 00:37.020
I'm here to ask you
to call off the hunt.

00:37.020 --> 00:39.100
It was an accident.
Bowers: You got shot,

00:39.100 --> 00:40.270
and your new
boyfriend ran off.

00:40.270 --> 00:42.150
The Callings said
you guys are gonna die!

00:42.150 --> 00:43.520
You need to be
with Michaela.

00:43.520 --> 00:45.440
She doesn't have much time.
And neither do you.

00:45.440 --> 00:47.070
He's never gonna know
about his Death Date.

00:47.070 --> 00:48.320
He's innocent.

00:48.320 --> 00:49.650
We have to make it possible
for him to come home.

00:49.650 --> 00:51.110
I didn't mean to hurt you,
and I did.

00:51.110 --> 00:52.990
What happens the next time
I get a Calling?

00:52.990 --> 00:54.660
This is what I need to do --
own up to my actions.

00:54.660 --> 00:56.200
Jared:
Zeke turned himself in.

00:56.200 --> 00:59.000
He knows he's guilty.

00:59.000 --> 01:02.040
You're not the only one
who can come back from the dead.

01:15.470 --> 01:18.810
We got to clear the airway.
Let's get him onto an I.V.

01:18.810 --> 01:20.350
Please step back, ma'am.

01:24.650 --> 01:27.520
Excuse me, is that -- Is that
Vance? How bad is it?

01:27.520 --> 01:30.070
Can you just tell me
how bad it is, please?

01:42.160 --> 01:43.670
Paramedic:
You okay, sir?

01:43.670 --> 01:47.170
My arm hurts like hell,
but I'll live,

01:47.170 --> 01:48.670
thanks to you
pulling me out of there.

01:48.670 --> 01:50.170
Sir, we need to get you
to a hospital.

01:50.170 --> 01:53.090
No, people inside
our own government

01:53.090 --> 01:54.260
were willing to kill me.

01:54.260 --> 01:55.760
If I'm gonna
take them down,

01:55.760 --> 01:57.510
I want them to think
they succeeded.

01:57.510 --> 02:01.230
You know the drill.

02:01.230 --> 02:04.190
The world needs to think
I'm dead.

02:04.190 --> 02:05.560
Michaela:
Well, I was convinced.

02:05.560 --> 02:07.270
Ben:
The whole world was.

02:07.270 --> 02:09.230
You would have loved
your funeral...

02:09.230 --> 02:10.530
Bobby.
Hmm.

02:10.530 --> 02:13.700
Well, I'm sorry I couldn't
tell the truth to you --

02:13.700 --> 02:15.530
well, both of you,

02:15.530 --> 02:17.530
but no one knows
except my guys,

02:17.530 --> 02:20.370
my wife,
and now the two of you.

02:20.370 --> 02:22.200
You want to bring her up
to speed, or should I?

02:22.200 --> 02:24.120
Well, I wasn't planning
to see you

02:24.120 --> 02:26.380
until I knew who the Major was,
but your bloodhound brother

02:26.380 --> 02:28.090
accelerated
our little reunion.

02:28.090 --> 02:30.130
Yeah, well,
that's our Ben for you.

02:30.130 --> 02:34.130
So far, I've identified a-a
black ops financial pipeline

02:34.130 --> 02:39.260
that appears to be funding
a shadow 828 investigation.

02:39.260 --> 02:41.390
Suffice it to say,
I've been following the money.

02:41.390 --> 02:43.890
And in the past week,
that money has doubled.

02:43.890 --> 02:45.730
Why?
What's the Major planning?

02:45.730 --> 02:47.560
Well, that's why
I asked you here.

02:47.560 --> 02:49.730
I was hoping one of you
could tell me.

02:49.730 --> 02:54.240
A budget spike like that had to
be the response to something.

02:54.240 --> 02:56.450
Did anything significant happen

02:56.450 --> 02:58.200
to the 828 passengers
this week?

02:58.200 --> 03:00.120
Hmm,
not that we know of.

03:00.120 --> 03:02.240
You want me to do
some poking around?

03:02.240 --> 03:04.120
Stone, the last time
you poked around,

03:04.120 --> 03:05.250
you ended up
in the back of a van

03:05.250 --> 03:06.620
with a hood
over your head.

03:06.620 --> 03:10.130
Right. Yeah.
I'll leave the espionage to you.

03:10.130 --> 03:11.130
But I have been connecting
with more

03:11.130 --> 03:12.840
and more passengers
every day.

03:12.840 --> 03:15.800
In fact, I've got a meeting
in an hour with an 828er.

03:15.800 --> 03:17.180
He's a freshman
at Astoria.

03:17.180 --> 03:19.800
He called me
twice yesterday.

03:19.800 --> 03:22.140
Seems like he's got
something to tell me.

03:22.140 --> 03:23.600
Good.

03:23.600 --> 03:25.520
'Cause after all this is over,
I can stop being dead,

03:25.520 --> 03:29.270
and I would really
like you all to live.

03:29.270 --> 03:30.690
And maybe we can get
to the bottom

03:30.690 --> 03:33.940
of where the hell you all went
for 5 1/2 years.

03:51.380 --> 03:53.380
Ben: TJ.
Hey.

03:53.380 --> 03:54.630
Hey.

03:54.630 --> 03:55.630
Thanks for meeting me
on campus.

03:55.630 --> 03:57.300
No problem.

03:57.300 --> 03:59.970
I'd forgotten how quiet
a campus gets

03:59.970 --> 04:01.300
between sessions.

04:01.300 --> 04:02.510
I used to be a professor.

04:02.510 --> 04:05.270
You don't teach anymore?

04:05.270 --> 04:06.810
No, I'm trying,

04:06.810 --> 04:09.690
but with all
the attention and suspicion,

04:09.690 --> 04:12.310
the opportunities
just haven't been there.

04:12.310 --> 04:13.020
Yeah.

04:13.020 --> 04:17.650
828 changed my life
a lot.

04:17.650 --> 04:19.820
Me too.

04:19.820 --> 04:22.200
It changed
everything for me.

04:22.200 --> 04:24.280
I used to love it here.

04:24.280 --> 04:25.540
Did well in my classes,

04:25.540 --> 04:27.830
joined the cross country team,
the Latin club.

04:27.830 --> 04:30.370
I was in it.

04:30.370 --> 04:32.880
And my mom was proud...

04:32.880 --> 04:35.500
which made me proud.

04:35.500 --> 04:37.170
And then
you went to Jamaica.

04:42.390 --> 04:43.850
You know, this was
probably a mistake.

04:43.850 --> 04:45.510
I'm sorry
that I bothered you.

04:45.510 --> 04:47.680
TJ.

04:47.680 --> 04:50.270
Listen, you asked me here
for a reason.

04:58.400 --> 05:01.860
Is it because
you're seeing things?

05:01.860 --> 05:05.240
Hearing things, maybe?

05:05.240 --> 05:07.370
Both.

05:07.370 --> 05:10.410
And they've gotten...

05:10.410 --> 05:11.870
Hey, it's okay.
You can talk to me about this.

05:11.870 --> 05:14.380
I-I get them, too.
A lot of us do.

05:15.960 --> 05:18.380
"Callings."

05:18.380 --> 05:20.420
Sometimes they can be
pretty terrifying.

05:22.720 --> 05:25.720
Like seeing
your own death?

05:25.720 --> 05:27.890
Yeah.

05:27.890 --> 05:30.060
Yeah, like that.

05:30.060 --> 05:31.440
This morning,
I had a vision

05:31.440 --> 05:33.900
of being inside
my own grave.

05:33.900 --> 05:36.440
Cal: You think it's
a Death Date Calling?

05:36.440 --> 05:37.900
You still thinking

05:37.900 --> 05:39.230
about the "save
the passengers" Calling?

05:41.570 --> 05:43.570
Yeah, me too.

05:43.570 --> 05:45.410
It felt like the plane
was crashing.

05:45.410 --> 05:49.450
So maybe it's showing us
how we're gonna die?

05:49.450 --> 05:51.580
Um...

05:51.580 --> 05:54.460
Well, your dad seems to think
that it's about

05:54.460 --> 05:56.250
saving the passengers
before the Death Date.

05:58.340 --> 06:00.920
It felt more urgent
than that, didn't it?

06:00.920 --> 06:03.470
I know.
We have to talk to Zeke.

06:03.470 --> 06:05.680
He was on the plane
in our Calling,

06:05.680 --> 06:07.600
even though he wasn't
in real life.

06:07.600 --> 06:09.430
That means something.
Yeah, I know.

06:09.430 --> 06:11.390
Well, once he's out on bail,
we can talk to him.

06:11.390 --> 06:14.940
He had the same Calling,
so --
He didn't.

06:14.940 --> 06:16.480
How do you know that?

06:16.480 --> 06:18.770
In the Calling, he couldn't
hear us or see us,

06:18.770 --> 06:20.440
and neither
could anyone else.

06:20.440 --> 06:22.360
We have to save him,

06:22.360 --> 06:23.490
just like we have to save
the rest of the passengers.

06:23.490 --> 06:24.860
Okay,
I'm gonna try again

06:24.860 --> 06:28.330
to talk to him, alright?

06:28.330 --> 06:29.780
Okay.

06:29.780 --> 06:31.700
I'm gonna miss having you
live with us, Auntie Mick.

06:31.700 --> 06:33.960
Well, I'm gonna miss
stealing your waffles, buddy,

06:33.960 --> 06:36.420
but I got to go back
to my apartment.

06:36.420 --> 06:37.630
It's time.

06:47.470 --> 06:50.470
Are you sure about this?

06:50.470 --> 06:54.140
Once we know,
we can't un-know.

06:54.140 --> 06:58.400
It's gonna be okay,
no matter what.

07:01.400 --> 07:04.490
Paternity, right?
Yeah.

07:04.490 --> 07:07.700
So, we just need to get
a single vial of blood

07:07.700 --> 07:09.530
and then
I'll swab your cheek

07:09.530 --> 07:10.910
and we'll send them
both to the lab

07:10.910 --> 07:13.540
and we should have results back
within one to two days.

07:13.540 --> 07:14.830
Great.

07:14.830 --> 07:17.420
Are you afraid of needles?
No.

07:20.500 --> 07:23.420
Stop.

07:23.420 --> 07:24.590
Who...?

07:24.590 --> 07:26.550
You okay?

07:26.550 --> 07:28.510
Um, uh...

07:28.510 --> 07:30.850
Stop.

07:30.850 --> 07:32.010
Grace?

07:32.010 --> 07:34.020
Stop!

07:34.020 --> 07:36.730
Grace!
I'm -- I'm sorry,
we have to go!

07:36.730 --> 07:38.560
Wait, you -- you -- you --
you can't -- you can't just --

07:38.560 --> 07:39.690
We have to go.

07:39.690 --> 07:41.020
Honey.

07:41.020 --> 07:44.400
Honey, are you okay?
What just happened?

07:44.400 --> 07:48.110
I just h-heard
my own voice,

07:48.110 --> 07:50.570
over and over,

07:50.570 --> 07:53.540
telling me to stop.

07:53.540 --> 07:55.450
Oh, my God.

07:57.960 --> 07:59.710
You just had a Calling.

08:10.510 --> 08:11.720
I don't understand.

08:11.720 --> 08:13.720
How could I have a Calling?

08:13.720 --> 08:15.140
It doesn't make any sense.

08:15.140 --> 08:17.770
I wasn't --
I wasn't on the plane.

08:20.060 --> 08:21.980
But I was.

08:21.980 --> 08:23.610
That still
doesn't explain...

08:28.740 --> 08:30.410
Oh, my God.

08:32.780 --> 08:34.160
The pregnancy.

08:34.160 --> 08:35.950
It's the only thing
that makes sense.

08:38.540 --> 08:40.670
So...

08:40.670 --> 08:44.000
that would mean...

08:44.000 --> 08:46.250
it's your baby.

08:46.250 --> 08:47.670
It sure seems that way.

08:51.840 --> 08:54.470
God, Ben, it's your baby.

09:02.770 --> 09:04.610
Come on.

09:04.610 --> 09:06.440
Let's get you home.

09:07.780 --> 09:09.610
Come on.

09:13.700 --> 09:16.490
That inmate
is refusing visitors.

09:16.490 --> 09:18.950
Ezekiel Landon?

09:18.950 --> 09:20.120
Can you try again?

09:20.120 --> 09:22.120
That inmate's
refusing visitors.

09:22.120 --> 09:23.630
Uh, does this help?

09:23.630 --> 09:25.170
Sure, assuming
the ADA sent you,

09:25.170 --> 09:28.000
advised the inmate's lawyer,
and you have a case number.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.210
No, I'm not officially
on the case,

09:29.210 --> 09:30.510
but I'm
an interested party.

09:30.510 --> 09:32.630
I'm a friend of his.
You...

09:32.630 --> 09:33.800
Next.

09:33.800 --> 09:35.890
Thank you.
Have a good day.

09:39.970 --> 09:42.890
Wycoff and Holland,
look into the automobile theft

09:42.890 --> 09:44.650
at Clark Towing.
I got it.

09:44.650 --> 09:46.520
And, Raines,
your warrants came through

09:46.520 --> 09:49.650
on the 15th Avenue bust.

09:49.650 --> 09:52.820
And of course, welcome,
Detective Stone,

09:52.820 --> 09:54.570
back from medical leave.

10:00.830 --> 10:03.540
Okay, let's get to it.

10:03.540 --> 10:04.830
Detective Stone.
Hi.

10:04.830 --> 10:06.330
Hi.
Drea Mikami.

10:06.330 --> 10:07.920
I just want to say it's such
an honor to meet you.

10:07.920 --> 10:09.630
Oh.

10:09.630 --> 10:10.840
Your conviction record
is almost too good to be true.

10:10.840 --> 10:12.090
I was wondering, maybe,

10:12.090 --> 10:13.720
if you had a second,
we could sit down,

10:13.720 --> 10:14.840
and I could pick your brain
about how you --

10:14.840 --> 10:17.180
Um, Mikami, do you mind?

10:17.180 --> 10:18.890
Uh, kind of.
Yeah.

10:18.890 --> 10:20.680
Detective Stone, I see you've
met your new partner,

10:20.680 --> 10:22.180
Detective Mikami.

10:22.180 --> 10:24.350
Um...
Hold on.

10:24.350 --> 10:26.860
Captain. Captain.
Wow, this is --
This is great.

10:26.860 --> 10:28.110
Yeah, give --
one sec.

10:28.110 --> 10:30.570
Uh, Captain?

10:30.570 --> 10:32.110
Detective Stone and I --
we used to be partners.

10:32.110 --> 10:33.740
Yeah, and that partnership
triggered a lot

10:33.740 --> 10:35.610
of internal investigations

10:35.610 --> 10:37.240
and unwanted attention
from One PP.

10:37.240 --> 10:38.620
So now I'm in charge,

10:38.620 --> 10:40.870
and Detective Stone
has a new partner.

10:40.870 --> 10:42.700
Don't start sleeping
with this one.

10:45.040 --> 10:47.210
Hey.

10:47.210 --> 10:49.040
You know this
is not gonna work.

10:49.040 --> 10:51.630
You need me to have
your back here.

10:51.630 --> 10:52.960
You know what?

10:52.960 --> 10:54.220
Actually, I think
I just need you to let this go.

10:54.220 --> 10:56.090
Maybe it's for the best.
Clean break.

11:01.720 --> 11:03.730
Grace:
Definitely need this nap.

11:03.730 --> 11:06.600
I forgot how exhausting
it is to make a new human.

11:06.600 --> 11:08.730
Well, I am a big fan
of your work.

11:08.730 --> 11:10.770
We should still confirm.

11:10.770 --> 11:12.280
I'll go see Saanvi
as soon as I'm up.

11:14.610 --> 11:16.740
Hmm.

11:16.740 --> 11:18.070
It's that kid TJ,

11:18.070 --> 11:19.620
the one that had
the Death Date Calling.

11:19.620 --> 11:22.660
I was supposed to meet him
again tomorrow, but...

11:22.660 --> 11:24.250
Yeah.
Go.

11:24.250 --> 11:25.830
Alright.

11:31.340 --> 11:33.170
TJ?

11:33.170 --> 11:34.630
TJ?!

11:34.630 --> 11:37.680
TJ: Ben?

11:37.680 --> 11:38.930
I didn't know what to do.

11:38.930 --> 11:40.090
I didn't want
to call the police.

11:40.090 --> 11:41.260
Alright, what is it?
What happened?

11:41.260 --> 11:42.930
It wasn't me
I saw in the grave.

11:42.930 --> 11:44.770
What?
It wasn't me.

11:47.310 --> 11:49.650
Oh, my God.

11:54.730 --> 11:56.280
Oh, my God, TJ,
what happened?

11:56.280 --> 11:57.360
I have no idea.

11:57.360 --> 11:58.280
I was trying to follow
the Calling,

11:58.280 --> 11:59.780
to see if I could make
any more sense of it

11:59.780 --> 12:01.030
after we talked
this morning.

12:01.030 --> 12:03.280
A-And it brought you here?

12:03.280 --> 12:06.120
And I just started digging.

12:06.120 --> 12:08.160
God.
What do I do?

12:12.130 --> 12:13.840
Grace: Apparently,
the Calling

12:13.840 --> 12:15.300
only trusts you
to take my blood.

12:15.300 --> 12:17.970
This changes everything
I thought I knew.

12:17.970 --> 12:21.050
Scientifically speaking,
Callings have now been

12:21.050 --> 12:24.310
transferred genetically
through the baby.

12:24.310 --> 12:30.020
So, if it is
Ben's baby...

12:30.020 --> 12:32.690
will the Death Date
also transfer?

12:35.400 --> 12:38.740
We have no proof
of that...

12:38.740 --> 12:39.860
okay?

12:45.830 --> 12:48.710
Detective Vasquez,
129th.

12:48.710 --> 12:49.830
Catch me up.

12:49.830 --> 12:52.830
You are looking at late teens,
early 20s.

12:52.830 --> 12:54.250
Rigor is abating,

12:54.250 --> 12:58.170
suggesting that she's been
dead at least 36 hours.

12:58.170 --> 13:01.720
Blunt force trauma
and suffocation.

13:01.720 --> 13:05.050
We found a student key card
in her pocket.

13:05.050 --> 13:09.020
Campus security is going
to run it for an I.D.

13:09.020 --> 13:10.850
Thank you.

13:10.850 --> 13:12.440
You're campus security,
right?

13:12.440 --> 13:14.190
I want to know every time
and place that key card

13:14.190 --> 13:15.770
was used this week.

13:15.770 --> 13:17.230
Copy.

13:19.190 --> 13:20.360
Jared, I called 911.

13:20.360 --> 13:21.910
How'd you get put on this?

13:21.910 --> 13:23.450
Oh, I saw your name
as a reporting witness.

13:23.450 --> 13:26.450
I thought I should just
come check it out.

13:26.450 --> 13:28.750
Uh, this is TJ.

13:28.750 --> 13:30.910
He was on 828,
and he...

13:30.910 --> 13:33.370
found the body.

13:33.370 --> 13:36.210
Oh.
How, exactly?

13:36.210 --> 13:37.880
It's okay.

13:37.880 --> 13:39.760
He'll understand.

13:39.760 --> 13:43.050
Well, I was walking,
and, I don't know,

13:43.050 --> 13:44.800
I just had a feeling.

13:44.800 --> 13:47.470
So I started digging,
and I found her.

13:47.470 --> 13:50.810
I know how crazy
that must sound.

13:50.810 --> 13:52.390
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

13:57.770 --> 13:59.980
So, he's saying
that a Calling

13:59.980 --> 14:02.400
he had led him here,
and you believe him?

14:02.400 --> 14:04.860
Yeah, how else could he have
found the girl's body?

14:04.860 --> 14:06.490
He could have found her
by putting her there.

14:06.490 --> 14:08.790
Come on, Jared.
You think he killed her?

14:08.790 --> 14:10.160
Look, I don't think
anything, Ben.

14:10.160 --> 14:12.120
I'm gathering
the facts, okay?

14:12.120 --> 14:13.790
That's my job.

14:22.260 --> 14:24.010
You're a better cop
than a criminal.

14:24.010 --> 14:25.430
Sorry, what?

14:25.430 --> 14:27.100
You swiped that file
off Vasquez's desk.

14:27.100 --> 14:30.100
Is that his court docket?
Yep.

14:30.100 --> 14:32.140
Are you and Vasquez
in some kind of detente

14:32.140 --> 14:33.180
I need to know about?

14:33.180 --> 14:35.440
Uh, need to?
No.

14:35.440 --> 14:37.940
Got it.

14:37.940 --> 14:39.480
My last partner retired.

14:39.480 --> 14:42.440
Aviera. Good guy,
but super old-school.

14:42.440 --> 14:45.490
How did Aviera feel about
being paired with a rich kid?

14:45.490 --> 14:46.910
Where'd that come from?

14:46.910 --> 14:48.120
That watch
is three months' salary,

14:48.120 --> 14:49.830
you say things
like "detente,"

14:49.830 --> 14:51.910
and you have a photo
on your desk of a horse --

14:51.910 --> 14:52.870
English saddle,
not Western.

14:52.870 --> 14:54.460
So, yeah,
you're moneybags.

14:54.460 --> 14:55.870
Okay, not me, exactly,

14:55.870 --> 14:57.880
but my mom kind of killed it
on Wall Street.

14:57.880 --> 14:59.630
I'm guessing this isn't
quite the trajectory

14:59.630 --> 15:00.840
she had in mind for you.

15:00.840 --> 15:02.210
Being a cop?

15:02.210 --> 15:04.300
No.
But I love it.

15:04.300 --> 15:05.970
And I want to learn
from the best.

15:05.970 --> 15:06.880
So maybe lesson one

15:06.880 --> 15:08.300
is why you read arraignments
so carefully?

15:08.300 --> 15:10.390
Lesson one is this.

15:10.390 --> 15:12.310
What is the foundation
of any good partnership?

15:12.310 --> 15:13.640
Trust.
Great.

15:13.640 --> 15:15.310
So, you can trust me
not to tell anyone

15:15.310 --> 15:16.480
about your
Upper Eastside past.

15:16.480 --> 15:19.310
Tribeca. Deal.
What do I do?

15:19.310 --> 15:21.150
Cover for me while I deal
with something.

15:21.150 --> 15:23.070
Go.
I'll return the contraband.

15:31.990 --> 15:33.330
Oh, whoa.

15:33.330 --> 15:36.080
Hey.

15:36.080 --> 15:37.670
These are some
serious books.

15:37.670 --> 15:39.170
Yeah.
SAT prep.

15:39.170 --> 15:42.250
I'm starting to realize exactly
how much I don't know.

15:42.250 --> 15:44.550
Not all answers
can be found in books.

15:44.550 --> 15:46.010
Here.
Hang on to this.

15:49.010 --> 15:51.430
I love your jacket,
by the way.

15:51.430 --> 15:54.020
Grace: Olive?

15:54.020 --> 15:57.190
Who was that?

15:57.190 --> 15:59.690
I don't know.

15:59.690 --> 16:02.020
Oh, no, honey.

16:02.020 --> 16:03.520
We can't be talking
to Believers.

16:03.520 --> 16:05.230
No, mom, she's super nice.
I dropped my book.

16:05.230 --> 16:07.030
Sweetie, we have to be
really careful.

16:07.030 --> 16:08.530
If they find out
there's an 828 baby --

16:08.530 --> 16:10.530
If it is an 828 baby.

16:13.080 --> 16:16.120
It is.
Wait. Wait.

16:16.120 --> 16:18.080
So, i-it is dad's baby?

16:18.080 --> 16:20.580
You took the paternity test.
Yeah.

16:20.580 --> 16:23.210
I mean, not exactly,
but, yeah, it's dad's.

16:25.050 --> 16:26.420
Wait, what?

16:26.420 --> 16:29.220
I'm --
How do you know, then?

16:31.970 --> 16:33.970
Um...

16:33.970 --> 16:35.390
I had a Calling.

16:35.390 --> 16:37.640
What? Wait?
How -- How is that even...?

16:37.640 --> 16:38.980
I-I don't know.

16:38.980 --> 16:41.560
Something to do
with the pregnancy.

16:41.560 --> 16:44.940
Sweetie, this is --
this is great news.

16:44.940 --> 16:47.490
We can all be one family,
just like we'd hoped.

16:49.650 --> 16:51.990
Not really.

16:51.990 --> 16:55.120
Now I'm the only one.

17:01.620 --> 17:04.250
Olive.

17:04.250 --> 17:05.920
Bailiff: All rise.

17:18.140 --> 17:20.100
Judge: Ezekiel Landon,
you are charged

17:20.100 --> 17:21.440
with one count of reckless
endangerment of human life...

17:21.440 --> 17:22.650
Where's his lawyer?

17:22.650 --> 17:25.440
I have no idea.
He won't talk to me.

17:25.440 --> 17:26.690
Yeah, me, neither.

17:26.690 --> 17:28.480
I can't lose him again.

17:28.480 --> 17:30.610
What if I can't
afford the bail?

17:30.610 --> 17:31.990
We're gonna get the money.

17:31.990 --> 17:34.530
One count of assault
in the first degree.

17:34.530 --> 17:37.160
And you wish to defend yourself?

17:37.160 --> 17:39.540
I do.
Can I make a statement?

17:39.540 --> 17:42.120
Go ahead.

17:42.120 --> 17:45.130
Your Honor, I've made a lot
of mistakes in my life,

17:45.130 --> 17:49.010
and I've hurt people,
good, decent people

17:49.010 --> 17:52.800
whose only flaw
was believing in me.

17:52.800 --> 17:56.640
I hurt my little sister,
my parents,

17:56.640 --> 17:59.470
and I hurt someone --

17:59.470 --> 18:01.020
someone I never wanted
to hurt.

18:05.650 --> 18:08.070
I don't want
to spend the time

18:08.070 --> 18:09.480
I have left fighting
these charges

18:09.480 --> 18:11.240
and dragging out the pain
for those I care about.

18:11.240 --> 18:12.700
What are you doing?
Stop.

18:12.700 --> 18:14.160
As to the count of assault
in the first degree,

18:14.160 --> 18:15.320
I plead guilty.

18:15.320 --> 18:17.160
Zeke, stop!
No, you can fight this!

18:17.160 --> 18:19.200
Your Honor, it was an accident.
-Order in the court!

18:19.200 --> 18:21.040
Zeke, you can fight this!
It was an accident!

18:21.040 --> 18:23.040
No! Zeke!
No, no, no, Zeke!

18:23.040 --> 18:24.210
As to the count of illegal
possession of a firearm...

18:24.210 --> 18:26.130
Zeke, stop!
...I plead guilty.

18:26.130 --> 18:27.340
What are you doing?
You can fight this.

18:27.340 --> 18:28.710
Ma'am, please.
As to the count of fleeing

18:28.710 --> 18:30.340
the scene of a crime,
I plead guilty.

18:30.340 --> 18:31.670
It was an accident.
Your Honor, it was an accident.

18:31.670 --> 18:33.510
None -- None of it
was supposed to happen!

18:33.510 --> 18:36.220
As to the count of reckless
endangerment of human life...

18:39.180 --> 18:41.100
...I plead guilty.

18:47.910 --> 18:49.490
Hey.
Hey.

18:49.490 --> 18:51.160
How are you holding up?
Yeah, I've been better.

18:51.160 --> 18:55.710
I just can't believe Zeke
pled guilty to...

18:55.710 --> 18:57.170
How's Grace?

18:57.170 --> 18:58.750
Taking it easy.

18:58.750 --> 19:01.550
She's still thrown by the whole
getting a Calling thing.

19:01.550 --> 19:02.670
I can't wrap my head
around that.

19:02.670 --> 19:03.880
it doesn't make any sense.

19:03.880 --> 19:06.010
I feel like
we say that a lot.

19:06.010 --> 19:08.430
It's true.

19:08.430 --> 19:11.680
Is that him?
Mm-hmm.

19:11.680 --> 19:14.470
Hi, I'm, uh, Michaela.
You must be TJ.

19:14.470 --> 19:16.430
Hi.
I hear Detective Vasquez

19:16.430 --> 19:17.770
brought you in
for a follow-up.

19:17.770 --> 19:19.440
Though he's kept us
waiting long enough.

19:19.440 --> 19:20.690
It's fine.

19:20.690 --> 19:22.110
TJ's a glutton
for punishment.

19:22.110 --> 19:24.530
He's a cross-country runner
who studies Latin.

19:24.530 --> 19:26.440
Ooh!

19:26.440 --> 19:29.410
My office, Detective.

19:29.410 --> 19:30.700
What's that about?

19:30.700 --> 19:32.700
Um, probably my
unscheduled appearance

19:32.700 --> 19:35.410
at Zeke's arraignment.

19:35.410 --> 19:38.420
You don't have to wait
with me.

19:38.420 --> 19:39.500
Yeah.

19:39.500 --> 19:40.920
If you're here, I'm here.

19:40.920 --> 19:45.710
The question is...
do you want to stay?

19:45.710 --> 19:48.550
I want to see it through.

19:48.550 --> 19:50.640
I mean, there's got
to be a reason

19:50.640 --> 19:52.720
why I got this
Calling, right?

19:52.720 --> 19:55.470
Why it was sent to me
and not you or your sister?

19:55.470 --> 19:57.140
Yeah, maybe.

19:57.140 --> 20:00.900
We still haven't figured out
exactly how it works.

20:00.900 --> 20:02.060
Well, at least
you have each other.

20:02.060 --> 20:03.400
Hmm.

20:05.440 --> 20:07.610
Just like me with my mom.

20:07.610 --> 20:09.150
She was cool.

20:09.150 --> 20:11.740
More like a best friend,
you know?

20:11.740 --> 20:13.740
If your best friend constantly
makes you eat salmon

20:13.740 --> 20:16.750
and listen to Madonna.

20:16.750 --> 20:19.580
Sounds like
you guys were close.

20:19.580 --> 20:21.170
Yeah.

20:23.460 --> 20:25.090
What happened to her?

20:30.180 --> 20:35.510
When the plane went missing, um,
she must have felt like

20:35.510 --> 20:37.640
she didn't have anything
left to live for.

20:39.940 --> 20:42.690
And she OD'd on sleeping pills
a month later.

20:46.520 --> 20:49.780
Oh, TJ, I'm so sorry.

20:53.620 --> 20:55.620
My mom died
when we were gone, too.

21:01.830 --> 21:06.210
While I was gone, the school
emptied my dorm room,

21:06.210 --> 21:08.510
and my mom's landlord
tossed her stuff.

21:10.550 --> 21:13.970
So I don't have anything.

21:13.970 --> 21:15.970
Not even a photo of her.

21:25.730 --> 21:28.650
Hi, excuse me. I need access
to a DNA Sequencer.

21:28.650 --> 21:29.980
Dr. Bahl!

21:29.980 --> 21:31.820
Troy Davis, remember?

21:31.820 --> 21:33.070
I tightened up
the beard a little.

21:33.070 --> 21:34.820
Yes. Hi.
Right.

21:34.820 --> 21:36.160
How are you doing?
You know what?

21:36.160 --> 21:37.700
I think I left my I.D.
in my office.

21:37.700 --> 21:38.830
Don't worry.
I can vouch.

21:38.830 --> 21:40.910
Y-You need
a DNA Sequencer.

21:40.910 --> 21:42.710
What do you need it for?

21:42.710 --> 21:43.580
Anything interesting?

21:43.580 --> 21:45.000
I would love to help.

21:45.000 --> 21:48.670
Oh, it's just a theory
that I'm working up.

21:48.670 --> 21:51.840
Is it about
that blood marker?

21:51.840 --> 21:55.550
From your
pediatric patient?

21:55.550 --> 21:57.180
I'll just put down
"research."

21:59.890 --> 22:02.100
And by the way,
I would love to help.

22:02.100 --> 22:03.690
Yeah,
you mentioned that.

22:03.690 --> 22:05.190
Just, uh, have the machine
delivered,

22:05.190 --> 22:07.860
and we can play
the rest by ear.

22:07.860 --> 22:09.520
Thank you.

22:35.220 --> 22:36.630
Captain Riojas was --

22:36.630 --> 22:38.800
Let me tell you
how it works in my precinct.

22:38.800 --> 22:40.720
We have rules.

22:40.720 --> 22:42.600
And making a scene at your
own assailant's hearing

22:42.600 --> 22:43.890
violated
several of them.

22:43.890 --> 22:45.270
He's not my assailant.

22:45.270 --> 22:47.730
Not an assailant,
not your boyfriend.

22:47.730 --> 22:49.690
You keep correcting me,
and we just met.

22:49.690 --> 22:51.230
He shot a cop.

22:51.230 --> 22:52.820
That's confirmed
by Detective Vasquez,

22:52.820 --> 22:54.610
who witnessed it,
and by the defendant himself,

22:54.610 --> 22:55.610
who pled guilty.

22:55.610 --> 22:56.740
Right, but it's not
that simple.

22:56.740 --> 22:57.990
It's exactly that simple.

22:57.990 --> 22:59.740
It's a nice, simple,
closed case.

22:59.740 --> 23:02.160
The only one who's trying to
make it difficult here is you.

23:02.160 --> 23:03.910
He didn't mean to.

23:03.910 --> 23:05.750
Well, he sure as hell meant
to plead guilty, Detective.

23:05.750 --> 23:07.330
So drop it.

23:20.090 --> 23:22.640
Jared: Mick.
You want to tell me

23:22.640 --> 23:24.430
why you've been making
that kid wait all day?

23:24.430 --> 23:26.100
Oh, you're referring to the kid
who swears he doesn't know

23:26.100 --> 23:28.190
anything about a homicide victim
he just happened to dig up?

23:28.190 --> 23:30.770
No, he doesn't, Jared.
Ben told you.

23:30.770 --> 23:32.770
He -- He had a Calling.

23:32.770 --> 23:34.280
TJ never met her.

23:34.280 --> 23:36.280
His fingerprints are all over
the victim's room.

23:38.950 --> 23:41.370
His prints were
in her room?

23:41.370 --> 23:44.120
Okay, no, there's
an explanation for this.

23:44.120 --> 23:45.290
Just because he was
on that plane

23:45.290 --> 23:46.660
does not mean
he's not a murderer.

23:46.660 --> 23:47.620
Jared,
you're doing it again,

23:47.620 --> 23:49.120
where you're looking
for the worst in people.

23:49.120 --> 23:51.170
No, I'm looking
for the evidence.

23:51.170 --> 23:52.960
He knew exactly
where the body was.

23:52.960 --> 23:54.800
Okay, his fingerprints
were found all over a room

23:54.800 --> 23:56.300
of a victim
he swore he never met.

23:56.300 --> 23:57.720
You know the drill.

23:57.720 --> 23:58.970
Mick, you know
I got to do this.

23:58.970 --> 24:01.850
No, actually, you --
Jared, come on, stop.

24:01.850 --> 24:04.310
Oh, my God.
Finally.

24:04.310 --> 24:05.850
Stand up and turn around,
please.

24:05.850 --> 24:07.810
What?
Stand up and turn around.

24:07.810 --> 24:09.850
Jared, what's going on?
You have the right
to remain silent...

24:09.850 --> 24:11.860
Come on, Jared. What the hell?
You said he'd understand!

24:11.860 --> 24:12.900
Listen to me, Ben.
I didn't do it.

24:12.900 --> 24:14.150
Please. I didn't do it.
Please!

24:14.150 --> 24:15.820
Jared, he's innocent!
Jared!
Ben!

24:15.820 --> 24:17.150
Mick, you've got --
I didn't do it!

24:17.150 --> 24:19.240
Please, listen to me!
Do something, please!

24:19.240 --> 24:20.700
Ben! Ben!

24:23.700 --> 24:25.700
Hey, look at me.
Look at me.

24:39.840 --> 24:41.180
You feel that?

24:44.050 --> 24:45.890
What the hell
you talking about?

24:56.770 --> 24:59.360
Get him out of here.

24:59.360 --> 25:00.860
No, stop!

25:00.860 --> 25:02.360
Please let go!
No!

25:11.210 --> 25:13.040
Jared's still
interrogating TJ.

25:13.040 --> 25:15.040
It could take hours.

25:15.040 --> 25:17.920
Well, I'm not leaving.
Okay.

25:17.920 --> 25:19.920
I told TJ I was here for him,
and I meant it.

25:19.920 --> 25:21.760
Now, can we discuss
what happened?

25:21.760 --> 25:23.930
I've never seen anyone shake
like that during a Calling.

25:23.930 --> 25:26.140
I know.
It -- It felt like turbulence,

25:26.140 --> 25:28.220
like the plane Calling
Cal and I had.

25:28.220 --> 25:29.850
When he told you to
save the passengers?

25:29.850 --> 25:30.980
Yeah.

25:34.770 --> 25:37.230
It happened right
when TJ was arrested.

25:37.230 --> 25:39.320
He's a passenger.
It's telling you to save him.

25:39.320 --> 25:41.900
He's clearly innocent.

25:41.900 --> 25:43.450
No, actually.

25:43.450 --> 25:45.070
Not clearly.
What?

25:45.070 --> 25:46.990
Look, TJ told us
that he'd never met her,

25:46.990 --> 25:49.410
but his prints
were all over her room.

25:49.410 --> 25:51.120
Ben, I've gone over
and over the file.

25:51.120 --> 25:53.920
Her name was Frannie.

25:53.920 --> 25:56.340
She was an art student.

25:56.340 --> 25:58.340
Well, he didn't do it.

25:58.340 --> 25:59.880
That's not what
the evidence says.

25:59.880 --> 26:01.420
Well, find new evidence!

26:01.420 --> 26:03.090
Ben. You're too close
to this, okay?

26:03.090 --> 26:04.800
Oh, and you weren't close
to the guy

26:04.800 --> 26:06.510
who shot you and ran off?

26:06.510 --> 26:07.930
Don't bring Zeke into this.
You know he's innocent.

26:07.930 --> 26:09.930
So is TJ!

26:09.930 --> 26:13.480
Ben, you've known him
for one day, okay?

26:13.480 --> 26:14.980
You are way too trusting,
and I --

26:14.980 --> 26:17.820
and I love
that about you, but...

26:17.820 --> 26:19.610
it's a weakness, okay?

26:19.610 --> 26:21.820
TJ tells you a sob story,
and --

26:21.820 --> 26:23.320
He is a passenger.

26:23.320 --> 26:24.860
And you know what?
You're right.

26:24.860 --> 26:26.120
I do trust him.

26:26.120 --> 26:27.280
Because right now passengers
are pretty much

26:27.280 --> 26:28.450
the only people
I can trust.

26:28.450 --> 26:30.830
So, please, dig deeper.

26:34.370 --> 26:35.960
Okay.

26:35.960 --> 26:37.960
But if I find more proof

26:37.960 --> 26:40.460
that -- that he murdered
this girl,

26:40.460 --> 26:41.920
then it's my job
to make sure

26:41.920 --> 26:43.550
he never sees
the light of day.

26:54.140 --> 26:56.940
Cal: Can you take me
to see Auntie Mick?

26:56.940 --> 26:58.900
At the police station?

27:01.320 --> 27:03.900
Cal, what -- what's up?

27:03.900 --> 27:05.400
I need to talk to her.

27:05.400 --> 27:06.950
There's --
There's something

27:06.950 --> 27:08.870
we're supposed
to do together.

27:08.870 --> 27:09.990
It's important.

27:09.990 --> 27:11.410
Well, then,
you're in luck

27:11.410 --> 27:13.660
because your older
and oh-so-wiser twin sister

27:13.660 --> 27:16.040
just happens to be sitting
right in front of you,

27:16.040 --> 27:17.920
ready to listen.

27:17.920 --> 27:19.500
That's okay.

27:19.500 --> 27:22.670
But if mom or dad call,
tell them I need help.

27:22.670 --> 27:24.920
Cal.

27:24.920 --> 27:26.880
I-I can help.

27:26.880 --> 27:29.390
At least let me try.

27:29.390 --> 27:31.060
What is it?

27:31.060 --> 27:33.890
It's about a Calling.
You wouldn't understand.

27:36.190 --> 27:38.520
Okay.

27:38.520 --> 27:40.400
It's just that --
No, no, no.

27:40.400 --> 27:42.020
I get it.

28:32.410 --> 28:34.490
Having fun
with your new toy?

28:34.490 --> 28:36.250
Yeah,
I'm just getting set up.

28:36.250 --> 28:38.410
I can show you how I set up
my test runs on this baby.

28:38.410 --> 28:40.250
It's a little different
from other Sequencers.

28:40.250 --> 28:41.630
I'm just running
some test results

28:41.630 --> 28:43.130
before I even get started.

28:43.130 --> 28:45.250
Maybe we could get
a coffee or something

28:45.250 --> 28:46.420
while you're waiting.

28:46.420 --> 28:48.760
I figure
we're overdue, anyway.

28:48.760 --> 28:50.130
I suspect we may have more
in common

28:50.130 --> 28:51.970
than just being
keen researchers.

28:51.970 --> 28:53.600
Might be fun to find out.

28:53.600 --> 28:55.060
I'm sorry, what?

28:55.060 --> 28:56.100
Just rambling.

28:56.100 --> 28:57.270
♪ I'm a ramblin' man ♪

28:57.270 --> 29:00.100
Okay,
so, I have to go.

29:00.100 --> 29:01.100
Which means you
have to go.

29:01.100 --> 29:04.020
Right.
Okay.

29:04.020 --> 29:05.650
After you.

29:13.120 --> 29:15.080
I already told
the other cops.

29:15.080 --> 29:16.450
I don't know him.

29:16.450 --> 29:18.160
Frannie and I have been
sorority sisters

29:18.160 --> 29:19.450
for three years,

29:19.450 --> 29:21.170
and I've never seen
that guy before.

29:21.170 --> 29:23.040
Do you know why Frannie
stayed on campus

29:23.040 --> 29:24.130
in between sessions?

29:24.130 --> 29:26.380
She's a Visual Arts major.

29:26.380 --> 29:29.010
She was almost done
getting ready

29:29.010 --> 29:32.550
for her first solo show
at the campus gallery.

29:32.550 --> 29:34.340
It's supposed to open
this weekend.

29:42.140 --> 29:45.020
Is this Latin?
I think so, yeah.

29:45.020 --> 29:46.480
Why?
Maybe that's the crossover.

29:46.480 --> 29:47.690
Maybe they were both
in Latin.

29:47.690 --> 29:49.150
Those notes
aren't Frannie's.

29:49.150 --> 29:50.490
She didn't take Latin.

29:50.490 --> 29:52.570
Why does she have someone
else's stuff in her room?

29:52.570 --> 29:54.490
She had a ton of other
people's junk around.

29:54.490 --> 29:56.660
She pulled it out of the trash
for her art.

29:56.660 --> 29:59.160
She made collages
out of found objects.

29:59.160 --> 30:00.250
These must've been
the discards

30:00.250 --> 30:01.750
that didn't make it
into the show.

30:01.750 --> 30:04.370
Cross country, Latin --
This --

30:04.370 --> 30:07.750
This is TJ's stuff.
He was telling the truth.

30:07.750 --> 30:09.340
He was never in this room,
but his stuff was --

30:09.340 --> 30:11.510
his old stuff
from before 828.

30:24.690 --> 30:27.060
Michaela, you okay?

30:27.060 --> 30:29.520
Yeah, um...
Sorry.

30:29.520 --> 30:31.240
Just...

30:31.240 --> 30:33.570
Weird.
That's Frannie's key card.

30:33.570 --> 30:35.070
She must have dropped it

30:35.070 --> 30:36.370
when she was sorting
through stuff.

30:36.370 --> 30:38.370
Frannie had her key card
on her when she died.

30:38.370 --> 30:40.580
Must've been
a replacement.

30:40.580 --> 30:43.080
Campus security records
didn't have any reports

30:43.080 --> 30:44.370
of her card being lost.

30:44.370 --> 30:46.120
Or them
issuing a replacement.

30:46.120 --> 30:48.790
You think they'd keep
track of that.

30:48.790 --> 30:51.420
If you needed to get a new card,
where would you go?

30:54.550 --> 30:56.640
Someone looks happy.

30:56.640 --> 30:58.220
It's just a good day.

30:58.220 --> 31:01.220
How nice!
Personal or professional?

31:01.220 --> 31:02.390
Work.

31:02.390 --> 31:04.430
Have you met me?

31:04.430 --> 31:07.230
Though I think this lab tech
just asked me out today.

31:07.230 --> 31:09.270
He came by my office
claiming to be checking in

31:09.270 --> 31:10.070
on the Sequencer, but --

31:10.070 --> 31:12.280
I'm sorry.
Checking in on the what?

31:12.280 --> 31:13.610
It's a DNA Sequencer.

31:13.610 --> 31:16.570
Oh, got it.

31:16.570 --> 31:18.570
I had a new realization
about the Callings --

31:18.570 --> 31:20.740
that they might be
transferable, genetically,

31:20.740 --> 31:23.750
so I needed a new machine
to look at the DNA sequencing

31:23.750 --> 31:27.460
so I can isolate the --
I'm sorry.

31:27.460 --> 31:29.250
Sorry, this is so boring.

31:29.250 --> 31:30.630
If you're excited
about something,

31:30.630 --> 31:34.510
then I am happy to listen.

31:34.510 --> 31:37.300
It is really exciting.

31:37.300 --> 31:38.590
Actually, you know,

31:38.590 --> 31:40.430
Troy could be helpful
with the sequencing

31:40.430 --> 31:43.430
because the calibration
needs to be so precise.

31:43.430 --> 31:46.350
As long as I don't let him see
any of my research.

31:58.410 --> 32:01.290
Hey, I don't want
to do the SATs,

32:01.290 --> 32:05.130
and I really don't need
the lecture.

32:05.130 --> 32:06.590
Come here, love.

32:14.970 --> 32:19.140
I know how it felt when
we were the only two people

32:19.140 --> 32:21.190
not having the Callings.

32:21.190 --> 32:24.150
And I can only imagine
how you must be feeling now

32:24.150 --> 32:25.980
that I've had a Calling.

32:30.490 --> 32:35.200
Honey, we will always
be a family.

32:35.200 --> 32:38.500
Nothing can come
between us.

32:38.500 --> 32:40.170
Not even the Callings.

32:42.130 --> 32:44.130
Mom, do you think
I'm resentful

32:44.130 --> 32:47.510
because everyone else
gets the Callings and I don't?

32:47.510 --> 32:49.970
You're not?
Mom, I'm not resentful.

32:52.300 --> 32:54.640
I'm terrified.

32:54.640 --> 32:58.140
Because the Callings gave Cal
and dad the Death Date.

32:58.140 --> 33:01.140
How do you know that you
and the baby don't have it, too?

33:01.140 --> 33:04.810
And in five years,
you'll all be gone.

33:04.810 --> 33:06.980
And I'll be
the only one left.

33:10.400 --> 33:13.070
I had thought that
maybe the baby --

33:13.070 --> 33:14.410
I really don't see why

33:14.410 --> 33:17.040
I'm cramming
all of this SAT stuff

33:17.040 --> 33:20.660
just to be standing there
alone at my college graduation

33:20.660 --> 33:23.040
wishing that all of you
were alive.

33:27.550 --> 33:30.340
Honey, I'm sure
we'll be at --

33:30.340 --> 33:32.510
Mom, you're not sure
about anything!

33:34.510 --> 33:37.180
And you are lying
if you say you are!

33:45.100 --> 33:46.270
Hi, there.

33:46.270 --> 33:48.230
Detectives Mikami
and Stone, NYPD.

33:48.230 --> 33:49.690
Just wondering if we could,
uh, talk to you

33:49.690 --> 33:51.070
about Frannie King?

33:51.070 --> 33:52.610
Yeah, of course.
Whataya need?

33:52.610 --> 33:54.360
The card that she had on her
was a replacement.

33:54.360 --> 33:56.240
Just want to know
when it was issued.

33:56.240 --> 33:57.280
Hmm.

33:57.280 --> 34:00.870
There's no entry
in the log.

34:00.870 --> 34:03.540
Do you know who was on shift
the night before last?

34:03.540 --> 34:04.790
That'll be Wilkins.

34:06.290 --> 34:08.090
Wilkins.

34:13.590 --> 34:15.260
What's going on?

34:15.260 --> 34:17.470
Uh, that student who died --
Frannie King.

34:17.470 --> 34:19.220
She come in for
a key replacement?

34:19.220 --> 34:20.220
No.

34:20.220 --> 34:21.560
You sure?

34:21.560 --> 34:22.890
'Cause even if it's not
in the log,

34:22.890 --> 34:24.270
the key card machine's
a computer,

34:24.270 --> 34:25.560
so it records every output.

34:25.560 --> 34:27.150
We just got to download it.

34:31.150 --> 34:34.400
You know, a girl did run
in here for a card.

34:34.400 --> 34:36.910
She was in a hurry
to get back to her room.

34:36.910 --> 34:38.200
I guess
I forgot to log it.

34:38.200 --> 34:38.910
Why was she in a hurry?

34:38.910 --> 34:40.830
No idea.
She didn't talk much.

34:40.830 --> 34:42.290
She just took the card

34:42.290 --> 34:44.250
and headed towards
the west gate.

34:44.250 --> 34:45.580
Not towards her sorority?

34:45.580 --> 34:47.290
I don't know if she was
in a sorority.

34:47.290 --> 34:48.920
I just saw her leave,
and that was it.

34:48.920 --> 34:50.630
Sorry, so, you noticed
that she was in a hurry

34:50.630 --> 34:52.510
and where she was going,
but you --

34:52.510 --> 34:54.260
you didn't notice
the giant sorority letters

34:54.260 --> 34:55.760
on her sweatshirt?

34:55.760 --> 34:57.260
That's kind of selective
in your observations.

34:57.260 --> 35:01.140
Sorry, but that's
all I remember.

35:01.140 --> 35:02.680
I need to get going.

35:02.680 --> 35:04.430
Yeah, one more quick
question, actually.

35:04.430 --> 35:07.100
When did you get
the shiny new boots?

35:08.310 --> 35:13.280
It's really hard to get blood
out of leather, isn't it?

35:15.610 --> 35:17.160
You have the right
to remain silent.

35:17.160 --> 35:18.280
Anything you say can
and will be

35:18.280 --> 35:19.780
used against you
in a court of law.

35:19.780 --> 35:21.620
I assume
you're gonna clue me in

35:21.620 --> 35:23.200
as to what just happened.

35:23.200 --> 35:24.450
That's lesson
number two.

35:28.290 --> 35:30.170
Ben.
It's over.

35:32.340 --> 35:35.170
They found the perp's boots
in a Dumpster

35:35.170 --> 35:37.550
outside of his house
covered in Frannie's DNA.

35:37.550 --> 35:40.350
I should have been able
to help her, though.

35:40.350 --> 35:42.220
It's my fault.
No, no.

35:42.220 --> 35:44.180
She was dead before you
ever got the Calling.

35:44.180 --> 35:46.350
TJ, you couldn't
have saved her.

35:46.350 --> 35:47.980
Why would the Calling want me
to find a dead body?

35:47.980 --> 35:49.980
Without you, Frannie's body
may never have been found.

35:49.980 --> 35:51.690
At least now her family
can get some closure.

35:51.690 --> 35:53.480
Yeah, the guard left
his previous jobs

35:53.480 --> 35:55.230
under suspicion of harassment
and stalking.

35:55.230 --> 35:56.820
I mean, he was likely
a serial predator.

35:56.820 --> 35:59.490
You saved whoever would have
been his next victim

35:59.490 --> 36:00.660
or victims.

36:00.660 --> 36:01.990
But why me?

36:01.990 --> 36:04.580
Why did I get this Calling?

36:04.580 --> 36:06.200
I think we may know.

36:06.200 --> 36:08.830
Come on.
I'll show you.

36:08.830 --> 36:10.000
Thank you.

36:10.000 --> 36:12.340
Come on.

36:12.340 --> 36:13.750
Give me a second.

36:17.840 --> 36:20.510
Thank you.

36:20.510 --> 36:24.600
And I'm sorry I pushed
too hard before.

36:24.600 --> 36:26.720
It's another one
of my weaknesses.

36:26.720 --> 36:30.400
No, no. The, uh --
The only thing that I'm mad at

36:30.400 --> 36:32.690
is the fact
that you were right.

36:32.690 --> 36:35.230
So, I'm sorry, too.

36:41.860 --> 36:45.790
Congratulations on
an amazing solve, Stone.

36:45.790 --> 36:47.540
I've been looking back
at your cases,

36:47.540 --> 36:50.370
and you've had a lot of
solves from anonymous tips.

36:50.370 --> 36:52.040
A lot.

36:52.040 --> 36:56.380
So many, in fact, an ADA
might start asking questions.

36:56.380 --> 36:59.470
You see, I like a paper trail.

36:59.470 --> 37:00.970
I like a long paper trail.

37:00.970 --> 37:04.430
It means that my cops
are doing their jobs.

37:04.430 --> 37:07.270
So, tell me, detective,
how'd you solve this one,

37:07.270 --> 37:09.430
in two hours,
no less?

37:09.430 --> 37:10.890
Anonymous tip.

37:13.270 --> 37:15.480
It's your case, Vasquez.

37:15.480 --> 37:17.070
You buy that?

37:17.070 --> 37:18.280
I do.

37:18.280 --> 37:20.450
Really?

37:20.450 --> 37:22.740
Because I don't buy it
for a second.

37:22.740 --> 37:24.910
Going forward, I don't
want you two

37:24.910 --> 37:26.910
anywhere near the same cases.

37:33.960 --> 37:36.590
The school held onto
your stuff for years

37:36.590 --> 37:38.590
before they threw it out.

37:38.590 --> 37:42.430
But when they did,
it was found again...

37:44.470 --> 37:47.390
...by Frannie.

37:47.390 --> 37:50.430
That's why the Calling
led you to find her.

37:50.430 --> 37:52.020
'Cause she found you.

38:10.450 --> 38:14.040
I can stay
if you want me to.

38:14.040 --> 38:15.630
No.

38:15.630 --> 38:17.290
No, I just, uh...

38:19.960 --> 38:21.550
I don't know
how to thank you.

38:25.050 --> 38:28.390
Hey.

38:28.390 --> 38:30.010
Go see your mom.

38:32.810 --> 38:35.350
Ben Stone?

38:35.350 --> 38:36.690
Suzanne?

38:36.690 --> 38:38.440
You're kidding me.
How long has it been?

38:38.440 --> 38:39.980
Well,
for you or for me?

38:39.980 --> 38:42.400
What are you doing here?

38:42.400 --> 38:44.360
I'm a dean.
Well, can you believe it?

38:44.360 --> 38:45.660
Yeah, I can.

38:45.660 --> 38:47.490
You were the smartest student
in Number Theory.

38:47.490 --> 38:50.030
Well, my group study partner
was a real inspiration.

38:50.030 --> 38:51.540
What about you?

38:51.540 --> 38:52.830
Besides shattering
the laws of physics,

38:52.830 --> 38:54.370
what have you been up to?

38:54.370 --> 38:56.830
Actually, dean,
I'm on a job hunt, so if you --

38:56.830 --> 38:59.540
Ben.
Sent me your CV...today.

38:59.540 --> 39:01.170
My e-mail's on
the department's website.

39:01.170 --> 39:02.760
Okay.
Will do.

39:10.680 --> 39:12.430
Hey!
Uh, you're the...

39:12.430 --> 39:15.520
Yeah, the girl with
the two tons of SAT books.

39:15.520 --> 39:17.690
No, you were so much more
than just that.

39:17.690 --> 39:20.020
You were the girl
in the killer jacket.

39:20.020 --> 39:21.400
Thank you.

39:21.400 --> 39:22.440
I'm Maxine Taylor.

39:22.440 --> 39:24.610
Olive.
Olive Stone.

39:24.610 --> 39:26.530
Wait.
"Stone," as in...

39:26.530 --> 39:29.740
Yes, but, you know, I don't
really want everyone to --

39:29.740 --> 39:31.530
Yeah, no worries!
Come in.

39:31.530 --> 39:32.870
Adrian's about to speak.

39:32.870 --> 39:35.540
And you have to tell me
where you shop.

39:35.540 --> 39:37.790
Deal, if you tell me
where you got your hair done.

39:37.790 --> 39:39.580
Oh, this is all DIY.

39:39.580 --> 39:40.710
I can hook you up.

39:53.560 --> 39:55.140
I don't suppose
you know anything

39:55.140 --> 39:57.560
about DNA Sequencers.

39:57.560 --> 40:00.980
I assume you're talking about
the one Saanvi's been using.

40:00.980 --> 40:02.570
She made a new discovery

40:02.570 --> 40:04.570
about a genetic change
to the 828ers,

40:04.570 --> 40:07.150
but she's been doing
the tests in her labs

40:07.150 --> 40:09.070
to keep it all under wraps.
How would you know about that?

40:09.070 --> 40:10.950
Because it's clearly
not under wraps.

40:10.950 --> 40:12.910
I've been tracking
the accounts.

40:12.910 --> 40:15.120
Looks like the Major
just ordered one.

40:19.580 --> 40:22.500
How the hell does the Major
know about Saanvi's discovery?

40:44.110 --> 40:46.530
Jared: Shots fired.
Officer down.

40:46.530 --> 40:47.440
Hold on, Michaela.

40:49.780 --> 40:51.110
I'm so sorry.

40:51.110 --> 40:54.620
Run.

41:02.540 --> 41:04.170
"Dear Zeke..."

41:07.960 --> 41:11.590
"I don't know how to say this,
other than I need you."

41:14.140 --> 41:15.550
It's happening again!

41:15.550 --> 41:17.640
Just hang on.
Just hang on.

41:17.640 --> 41:20.810
Zeke! Zeke!
Zeke, please!

41:26.230 --> 41:27.860
Zeke, can you hear me?

41:29.530 --> 41:30.900
Hey!

41:30.900 --> 41:32.700
Can you hear me?

41:40.250 --> 41:42.670
Zeke, I'm right here, okay?
Michaela.

41:42.670 --> 41:44.000
Hey, hey, hey,
I'm right here.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.670
I'm right here.

41:46.670 --> 41:48.210
Michaela.

41:48.210 --> 41:51.050
Zeke, I'm right here.
Zeke!

41:51.050 --> 41:52.680
Cal?

41:52.680 --> 41:55.640
Is that you?
Michaela?

41:55.640 --> 41:57.180
It's not working.
Let's double the dose.

41:57.180 --> 41:59.930
No, please.
I need...

41:59.930 --> 42:02.350
No, the Calling.

42:02.350 --> 42:03.890
No!

42:11.690 --> 42:13.570
I'm sorry.
