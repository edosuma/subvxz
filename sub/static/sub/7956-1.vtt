00:46.280 --> 00:53.482
Hey Oh, happy day, happy day

00:53.554 --> 00:56.148
Oh, happy day, happy day
Oh, what a happy day

00:56.224 --> 00:58.784
Oh, happy day, happy day
Ooh, ooh, ooh

00:58.860 --> 01:01.556
Oh, happy day, happy day

Oh, what a happy day

01:04.165 --> 01:07.259
Oh, happy day, happy day
Yeah, yeah

01:07.335 --> 01:12.329
Jesus, Jesus
Oh, my Jesus

01:12.407 --> 01:16.844
Jesus, Jesus, Oh, my Jesus
Wash my sins away

01:16.911 --> 01:20.904
Oh, happy day, happy day
Oh, yes it is

01:20.982 --> 01:24.349
He taught me how

01:24.419 --> 01:26.410
To walk
How to walk

01:26.487 --> 01:29.115
Fight and pray

01:29.190 --> 01:31.590
Fight and pray
Yeah, yeah

01:31.659 --> 01:35.720
And then rejoice
happy day, happy day

01:39.033 --> 01:43.231
Happy day
Oh, oh, oh, oh

01:43.304 --> 01:46.239
Ooh!
Oh, happy day, happy day

01:46.307 --> 01:48.400
Well, look what rolled in.

01:48.476 --> 01:52.537
You know, at first, I thought you was
old-ass Raisinet riding on a skateboard.

01:52.613 --> 01:56.982
I'd like to come over there and choke the
life out of you right in front of Jesus.

01:57.051 --> 02:01.488
Sweet Lord, give me strength. Don't make
me have to whup nobody's head in church.

02:01.556 --> 02:03.490
Ignore him, Lord.
Ignore all his prayers.

02:03.558 --> 02:06.994
He ain't nothing, never did nothing.
Give him a stroke or something.

02:07.061 --> 02:11.430
Do you, Sherman Klump?

02:11.499 --> 02:13.763
Yes, I do.

02:13.835 --> 02:15.996
Indeed, I do.

02:16.070 --> 02:20.097
Oh, happy day, happy day Oh, happy
day, happy day   Oh, yeah, happy day

02:21.542 --> 02:24.272
Happy day, happy day.
Happy day, my ass.

02:28.382 --> 02:31.351
Oh, he look handsome.

02:31.419 --> 02:35.014
Oh, my baby's finally getting married. Never
thought I'd live to see the day. Finally.

02:39.927 --> 02:41.918
Oh, here she comes,
here she comes.

02:58.679 --> 03:02.046
I'm gonna cry. I promised myself I'm
wasn't gonna cry. Now I'm gonna cry.

03:09.190 --> 03:12.023
Yeah, all right.
Dynamite.

03:12.093 --> 03:14.789
You may be seated.

03:14.862 --> 03:18.798
Oh, thank God.
Oh, thank God.

03:27.875 --> 03:30.105
I always knew he'd find
the right girl. Always knew.

03:30.177 --> 03:33.738
You see the Indian in her cheekbones?
Ooh! Sherman, Sherman. Sherman.

03:33.814 --> 03:36.248
Sherman, Sherman, Sherman.
Sherman! Oh, Lord.

03:36.317 --> 03:39.047
Shh, my baby's so stupid.

03:39.120 --> 03:41.816
Dearly beloved,
we have gathered here today...

03:41.889 --> 03:44.517
to join these two people
in holy matrimony.

03:44.592 --> 03:48.551
Praise the Lord.
The eminent scientist, Professor Sherman Klump...

03:48.629 --> 03:50.597
Mm-hmm.
and his longtime sweetheart,

03:50.665 --> 03:53.327
Denise Gaines.
Oh, Sherman.

03:56.337 --> 04:02.037
If anyone has any reason why these two
should not be wed, let him speak now...

04:03.978 --> 04:05.878
or forever hold his penis.

04:05.947 --> 04:09.041
Oh, Sherman.

04:09.116 --> 04:12.244
That's it, son. Show 'em
what the Klumps are made of!

04:12.320 --> 04:16.517
Sherman, put that away.
Sherman, calm down, baby. Save it for the honeymoon.

04:19.293 --> 04:22.922
Surprise!

04:24.832 --> 04:28.199
Hey, Sherman, calm down, boy.
What's wrong with you?

04:51.459 --> 04:54.451
This is some scar shit.
Yeah, like The Outer Limits.

04:54.528 --> 04:58.988
No, don't hurt yourself, baby.
You are coming with Buddy.

04:59.066 --> 05:03.969
No! No!
See you later, chunky butt!

05:04.038 --> 05:05.801
No!

05:05.873 --> 05:08.501
And then I wake up
in a cold sweat.

05:08.576 --> 05:12.307
How often do you have this
dream? More and more lately.

05:12.380 --> 05:16.316
You seem to be very fond
of this girl, Denise.

05:16.384 --> 05:18.852
My God, she is so special to me.

05:18.919 --> 05:23.356
But how's she gonna love me when I got Buddy
Love inside me? I wanna be perfect for her.

05:23.424 --> 05:26.291
Perfect?
No one is perfect, Sherman.

05:26.360 --> 05:30.262
You need to understand that
Buddy Love is a representation...

05:30.331 --> 05:33.459
of the uninhibited,
hedonistic id.

05:33.534 --> 05:36.332
He is not a real person.
Buddy Love is real!

05:36.404 --> 05:39.339
Well, he was real, and he does
take control of me sometimes.

05:39.407 --> 05:41.739
You will never learn to
control him... Sherman!

05:41.809 --> 05:44.778
until you accept the fact
that he is apart of you.

05:44.845 --> 05:47.939
Yeah, and the best part too! And
I'll tell you something else, punk!

05:48.015 --> 05:50.848
All these diplomas on this wall
don't make up for the fact...

05:50.918 --> 05:53.716
that you got a little Vienna
sausage in your drawers.

05:53.788 --> 05:56.814
Is that why they call you
a shrink? - Shut up, fat a-

05:56.891 --> 05:59.985
Sorry.

06:00.061 --> 06:02.689
Yeah, yes. Session got a little outta
outta control.

06:02.763 --> 06:07.166
You see, we all have
a little Buddy Love inside us.

06:07.234 --> 06:09.828
Yeah. But we can't
let him rule our lives.

06:09.904 --> 06:12.464
You're in charge, Sherman.
Can you say that for me?

06:12.540 --> 06:14.508
I'm in charge.
Can't hear you.

06:14.575 --> 06:16.475
I'm in charge.
Can't hear you!

06:16.544 --> 06:19.342
I'm in charge!
Sorry about that.

06:19.413 --> 06:24.715
Yeah. Klump in charge! I'm in charge!

06:26.687 --> 06:29.383
He's right. I am in charge.

06:29.457 --> 06:32.392
Klump in charge. Yes, indeed.

06:34.528 --> 06:38.828
Good afternoon, ladies.
Yeah.

06:43.404 --> 06:46.498
Hey, Professor Klump. How's it
going? Fantastic. How about yourself?

06:46.574 --> 06:49.096
Yeah.
Klump in charge.

06:49.230 --> 06:51.562
Afternoon. Good day. Hi.

06:51.632 --> 06:53.566
How you doing?

06:53.634 --> 06:57.627
Wonderful day.

06:57.705 --> 07:01.471
Beautiful day, isn't it, Professor?
Bite me, old hag. Oh!

07:01.542 --> 07:06.639
What?
Uh, uh, I said, he likes me. Look at him wag.

07:06.714 --> 07:10.150
Hey, little fella.
See that little tail wagging?

07:10.218 --> 07:14.348
Have a good day. I'm
in charge. My goodness.

07:22.763 --> 07:26.199
Kinda hot today, huh, Professor?
You have no idea how hot it is.

07:26.267 --> 07:31.000
Hot! Nice and hot!
Oh, Professor! I loved your lecture the other day.

07:31.072 --> 07:36.738
Oh, thankyou.
Thankyou so much.

07:36.811 --> 07:40.110
You're the man. You're
the man. I'm in control.

07:41.515 --> 07:43.449
Yeah, keep tellin'
yourself that, bubble butt!

07:52.760 --> 07:55.957
It is theoretically possible
to isolate the elements...

07:56.030 --> 07:59.466
of an individual's
genetic makeup and separate them.

07:59.533 --> 08:05.028
Now someday, we may be able to locate an
unhealthy risk factor in our DNA and remove it.

08:05.106 --> 08:08.542
Excuse me. Beg your pardon.

08:08.609 --> 08:10.543
I'm sorry.
Excuse me.

08:13.547 --> 08:17.210
Whether this is advisable
is another question entirely.

08:17.285 --> 08:20.948
Oh, my eye!
Oh, Professor Klump.

08:21.022 --> 08:24.048
Oh! Professor Gaines,
how are you?

08:24.125 --> 08:26.389
I was hoping I might be able
to sit in on your lecture.

08:26.460 --> 08:29.952
I'm sure we can accommodate you
since you were so quiet coming in.

08:30.031 --> 08:33.159
Well, it's very hard
to be quiet...

08:33.234 --> 08:35.168
when you're lecturing
on genomic extractions.

08:35.236 --> 08:37.932
I think it's ver exciting.
Oh, lagree completely.

08:38.005 --> 08:41.736
Something about the way the nucleotides
cohere with the target sequence.

08:41.808 --> 08:44.835
Yeah. I always say, ifyou can't be
with the nucleotide that you love,

08:44.912 --> 08:46.937
cohere with
the one you're with.

08:55.022 --> 08:57.855
Yeah.
Uh, anyway as I was-

08:57.925 --> 09:00.758
Uh, I want those
lab reports on my desk.

09:00.828 --> 09:05.356
No excuses.
I'll see you next time.

09:07.601 --> 09:09.865
Professor Gaines.

09:09.937 --> 09:13.373
Oh, Professor Klump.
Yeah.

09:13.441 --> 09:18.003
Um, yes, I was, um-
I was wondering if you had a-

09:18.079 --> 09:21.378
Dean Richmond, we were-
Just having... a little chat.

09:21.449 --> 09:23.383
Don't be bashful,
Professor Gaines.

09:23.451 --> 09:26.045
Pound-for-pound, this big lug's the greatest
scientist on the planet.

09:26.120 --> 09:30.819
And let's be honest, pound-for-pound, he is a planet.
That's said with love.

09:30.891 --> 09:34.224
Did you get those goo-goo clusters I sent you?
Yes, I did, thank you,

09:34.295 --> 09:37.321
but I'm on a diet right now,
so I can't eat 'em.

09:37.398 --> 09:39.559
And it's working beautifully.
No, I'm telling you.

09:39.633 --> 09:43.967
When I came in, with this light and in that outfiit,
you could really think for a second that-

09:44.038 --> 09:46.973
Anyway, you said you had
something to show me.

09:47.108 --> 09:50.043
I am so excited about this, Dean.
You will be too.

09:50.111 --> 09:53.046
You got that?
Come on. Jason, where's our patient?

09:53.114 --> 09:56.106
Right here, Professor. Come on, boy.

09:56.183 --> 09:59.914
Now this is Buster. Buster suffers from
acute arthritis and diminished vision,

09:59.987 --> 10:02.012
which are both signs of advanced aging.

10:02.089 --> 10:05.490
We're gonna see if we can fix all of Buster's
problems right now, aren't we, Buster?

10:05.559 --> 10:07.686
Yes, we are.
This little experiment...

10:07.762 --> 10:11.528
makes use of Professor Gaines's brilliant
research on gene targeting.

10:11.599 --> 10:15.000
Now, if I've composed this formula properly,

10:15.069 --> 10:18.095
this should be most impressive.

10:18.172 --> 10:21.608
All right, Buster.

10:29.183 --> 10:31.117
Jiminy freaking Cricket!

10:31.185 --> 10:35.212
Sherman, this is amazing.

10:35.289 --> 10:39.521
You've just discovered-
The fountain of youth. This is huge.

10:39.593 --> 10:42.960
Do you have any idea
what you've done? This is unbelievable. We're rich.

10:43.030 --> 10:45.521
We're gonna have every
pharmaceutical-company in the world...

10:45.599 --> 10:47.032
lining up
to throw money at us.

10:47.101 --> 10:48.966
Of course, it all has to be
properly tested first.

10:49.036 --> 10:52.802
Exactly, yes. He makes an interesting
point. Here's another. Shut up!

10:52.873 --> 10:56.104
Besides, look at the little fella.
He can lick his own winky again.

10:56.177 --> 10:59.044
There's not a guy in the world
who wouldn't wanna do that.

10:59.113 --> 11:02.082
Klump!
Dean Richmond!

11:02.149 --> 11:04.242
The effect is only temporary.
I'm sorry, sir. You're sorry?

11:04.318 --> 11:07.446
Oh, my goodness. I'm just tring not
to think where that tongue has been!

11:07.521 --> 11:09.455
You all right?

11:19.467 --> 11:22.800
Klump, party of six, please.
Yes, and we're hungry.

11:42.923 --> 11:45.084
Mama, you know, you really look good.
Have you been losing weight?

11:45.159 --> 11:48.185
Oh, thankyou, baby, no, but I'm getting ready
to start a new diet.

11:48.262 --> 11:52.096
Have some of this ambrosia.
I don't even like ambrosia.

11:52.166 --> 11:54.760
Don't tell me you don't like
ambrosia. You had some before, and you liked it.

11:54.835 --> 11:57.497
Have some adventure!
Oh, now I'm a child- I don't know what I like.

11:57.571 --> 11:59.562
...for the all-girls soccer team.

11:59.640 --> 12:02.473
Let me get that for you.
Oh, my baby's so gallant.

12:02.543 --> 12:06.946
Sherman, come here.
And it's called "All the pork you can eat" diet.

12:07.014 --> 12:11.212
You can have all the pork you want.
You can have ham, bacon, sausage.

12:11.285 --> 12:14.083
I got the wrong thing.
Take that. Thank you.

12:14.154 --> 12:16.418
Now I got a full portion.
Whateveryou wanna eat,

12:16.490 --> 12:18.424
just as long as you have three glasses
of grapefruit juice afterwards...

12:18.492 --> 12:21.256
because the grapefruitjuice
breaks down all the unwanted-

12:21.328 --> 12:25.196
Get away from there!
Stop that! Baby!

12:25.266 --> 12:28.724
Honey, get the baby. He's a boy, and boys
don't be doing stuff like that.

12:28.802 --> 12:31.999
Hey! Get your ass-
What?

12:32.072 --> 12:34.734
Please teach that boy manners.
He ain't gonna be acting like no hooligan with me.

12:34.808 --> 12:37.743
That was a spoon or fork? That was a
spoon. All right. Boys will be boys.

12:37.811 --> 12:40.871
Boys will be boys.

12:40.948 --> 12:44.179
Oh, this looks fabulous.
Yeah, it looks really good.

12:44.251 --> 12:46.617
How about getting another bottle of
red over here? Get some more wine.

12:46.687 --> 12:49.588
Hey, Ernie, maybe you wanna pace
yourself and take it easy, huh?

12:49.657 --> 12:53.388
Pace myself? Hey, this is a
celebration for Daddy retiring.

12:53.460 --> 12:57.920
We owe it to Daddy togetshit-faced,
andl'm gonnagetshit-faced.

12:57.998 --> 13:00.330
By the way, congratulations, Mr. Klump.

13:00.401 --> 13:03.996
She's so polite. Look here, Denise, you
have to stop that "Mr. Klump" stuff...

13:04.071 --> 13:06.835
'cause I've been hearing that
for the last year or so, and I'm starting to feel old.

13:06.907 --> 13:10.206
I ain't an oldman.
You are an old man.

13:10.277 --> 13:12.939
Ah, shit, Grandma,
what's wrong with you?

13:13.013 --> 13:15.208
If it isn't the Alzheimer's Express
right on schedule!

13:15.282 --> 13:18.115
Stop that! Hi, Mama.
She drove right on my bunion.

13:18.185 --> 13:21.120
Y'all have to excuse me
for being late.

13:21.188 --> 13:23.884
If you weren't my grandmother, boy-
If you weren't my grandmother!

13:23.958 --> 13:26.222
Me and Isaac started getting
kinda frisky in the car.

13:26.293 --> 13:29.421
Ooh!
Had to give him a little appetizer.

13:29.496 --> 13:32.056
Ooh, Mama.

13:32.132 --> 13:35.624
I just lost my damn appetite.
Mama, your dress is undone. Let me zip you up.

13:35.703 --> 13:38.137
Hurry. Zip herup in the back
before she starts looking...

13:38.205 --> 13:40.173
like one of them Zulu hags on the cover
of NationalGeographic.

13:40.240 --> 13:44.370
Clesius, what's wrong with you? That's my mother.
Like that movie, Shaka Zulu.

13:44.445 --> 13:47.471
You know something, Clesius?
Come on. Come on right now!

13:47.548 --> 13:50.073
I'm gonna tell you something.
I got a razor in this bag.

13:50.150 --> 13:53.950
Oh, yeah, I'll tell you what.
That ain't even no bag in yourhand. That's your titty.

13:54.021 --> 13:57.286
Clesius!
Oh, Jesus!

13:57.358 --> 14:01.089
She's an old bag with old bag titties.
Clesius, you out of your mind?

14:01.161 --> 14:04.221
He called your grandma's titty
a bag.

14:04.298 --> 14:06.926
Death!
Clesius Marcellus Klump.

14:07.001 --> 14:11.404
If it isn't the world's
oldest living Negro?

14:11.472 --> 14:13.906
Hey, how are things going
on the Underground Railroad, Isaac?

14:13.974 --> 14:16.807
Oh, Clesius, please, be nice to Mr. Isaac.
Goodevening, Mr. Isaac.

14:16.877 --> 14:18.845
Come on and have a seat.

14:18.912 --> 14:20.937
Good evening, Mr. Isaac.
How you doing tonight?

14:21.015 --> 14:23.609
Isaac know I'm playing. I play with Isaac
all the time. You know I'm messing with you.

14:23.684 --> 14:26.619
Oh, yeah, you say
what you wanna say,

14:26.687 --> 14:31.420
but Isaac's still like a Brahma bull
when it comes to relations, right, baby?

14:31.492 --> 14:34.188
You know what they say?
You're as young as you feel.

14:34.261 --> 14:38.027
Well, I must be 197.
Klump, funny you should say that.

14:38.098 --> 14:41.829
Denise and I have been doing some research on aging,
which has proven to be promising.

14:41.902 --> 14:44.377
Ooh, Baby, don't belch in public.

14:44.511 --> 14:46.911
Grandma don't wanna hear
all that nastiness. He bringing the bass, huh?

14:46.980 --> 14:49.471
You plan to eat, you gonna be belching,
cover your mouth.

14:49.549 --> 14:52.416
Hey, look, your grandpa ate
a whole plate of beans,

14:52.486 --> 14:54.420
you don't see me doing
the ol' butt trumpet, do you?

14:54.488 --> 14:56.979
Thank the Lord.
We don't have to hear all that nasty imagery.

14:57.057 --> 15:01.460
Butts and trumpets.
I'm gonna tell my grandson what I wanna say.

15:01.528 --> 15:05.965
Hey, can we get some toothpick?
Some toothpick!

15:06.032 --> 15:09.968
If I wanna put a trumpet in my ass and run around
this restaurant and blow...

15:10.036 --> 15:11.970
"Hallelujah, Yankee Doodle,"
that's my business!

15:12.038 --> 15:14.939
All I'm hearing is trumpets and asses.
I don't wanna hear that.

15:15.008 --> 15:16.942
Hey! You watch it now.

15:17.010 --> 15:19.103
You reach over here again,
you gonna pull back a nub.

15:19.179 --> 15:21.647
Oh, Clesius, she's fine. I like that.

15:21.715 --> 15:23.842
Tell me, don't touch the chicken.
Don't be hitting on people.

15:23.917 --> 15:25.885
I don't be getting hit on,
Sherman, you know that.

15:25.952 --> 15:28.921
Better eat up, Isaac,
'cause you gonna need your strength.

15:28.989 --> 15:33.551
Yeah, later on, me and Isaac gonna watch
Mating Season on the Serengeti.

15:33.627 --> 15:36.858
Oooh!
Don't take a lot to get Isaac going.

15:36.930 --> 15:39.296
Time out! Let me call a time out on that.
Lord, my, my.

15:39.366 --> 15:41.834
I don't wanna hear about you old-ass geriatrics.
Oh, yeah, Clesius?

15:41.902 --> 15:45.463
Me and Isaac might be
dried-up geriatrics,

15:45.539 --> 15:49.498
but ain't nothing wrong
with Isaac's love tackle.

15:49.576 --> 15:52.807
Ooh, Mama.
Oh, snap now.

15:52.879 --> 15:56.542
Hmm? What's the matter, Clesius, cat got your tongue?
Step on a nerve, Clesius?

15:56.616 --> 15:59.346
I get you.
Got you, got you. Got ya!

15:59.419 --> 16:01.853
These potatoes sure are
scrumptious, aren't they?

16:01.922 --> 16:05.824
Ain't that a kick in the head.
Yes, they're scrumptious, aren't they?

16:05.892 --> 16:08.884
Potato, my ass.
Ain't that a kick in the head?

16:08.962 --> 16:11.988
What that piece of spaghetti remind you of?
Oh!

16:12.065 --> 16:16.263
Oh, Grandma, now, come on. That's enough now.
Sure enough.

16:16.336 --> 16:20.397
Maybe Mr. Johnson, perhaps?

16:20.473 --> 16:24.375
Oh, Lord have mercy.
Let me tell you, old woman.

16:24.444 --> 16:27.675
What I do in my bedroom is my business.
You understand?

16:27.747 --> 16:31.410
Only thing you do in your bedroom is pull
the lint off your scrotum.

16:31.484 --> 16:35.250
Now it's getting thick.
See? That's the last straw.

16:38.458 --> 16:41.450
I think I'm gonna propose a toast.
Let's make a toast.

16:41.528 --> 16:44.520
To Daddy.
Hear! Hear!

16:44.598 --> 16:48.466
After 35 years of hard work in the
construction business, Thirty-five years!

16:48.535 --> 16:50.730
Daddy's gonna finally get
a chance to relax.

16:50.804 --> 16:53.932
Finally gonna get to relax.
This is true. - Damn right.

16:54.007 --> 16:55.372
And I'd like to say
in front ofeverbody here tonight-

16:55.442 --> 16:58.434
When you gonna stop jiving and
tell everbody you got laid off?

16:58.511 --> 17:01.446
Oh, my God.

17:01.514 --> 17:04.415
He's choking.

17:04.483 --> 17:06.816
Hey, somebody put the "Hemlock" on him?
Put your arm up!

17:06.886 --> 17:11.380
The "Hemlockmove. " Give me a knife
and straw. I'm gonna give him a tracheotomy.

17:11.458 --> 17:13.983
I seen them do it on E.R.

17:25.972 --> 17:28.600
It's allright, folks.
Everything's under control.

17:30.377 --> 17:33.403
Clesius. No, Clesius. Where
you going? Sherman! Clesius!

17:33.480 --> 17:36.916
Dad, where you
going? - Daddy! - Oh!

17:36.983 --> 17:41.283
Now you see what you did, Joe College?
You done messed up the whole party.

17:59.339 --> 18:02.706
Jason, I just know I'm not the one saying
all those awful things.

18:02.776 --> 18:07.304
It was him. You may be right, Professor.
Take a look at this reading.

18:10.383 --> 18:14.217
Right there. Recombining with the gene that governs
testosterone production.

18:16.389 --> 18:18.721
Buddy Love.

18:21.294 --> 18:23.489
I told you.
That's Buddy Love.

18:23.563 --> 18:25.394
Don't panic. Allright.

18:25.465 --> 18:28.559
We should be able to get rid of him.
According to Denise's theories,

18:28.635 --> 18:31.126
we should be able to isolate that gene and extract it.
No, no way.

18:31.204 --> 18:33.695
Professor, what you're talking about
is extremely dangerous.

18:33.773 --> 18:36.241
Those traces of Buddy must've been
in your system this whole time.

18:36.309 --> 18:39.335
You've been able to keep them under control.
Not anymore. He's back now.

18:39.412 --> 18:43.542
He's coming back 'cause he knows
I'm happy and he wanna ruin everthing.

18:43.616 --> 18:46.278
Yeah, but he is not a he.
He is a gene.

18:46.352 --> 18:50.049
He's just part of you.
Oh, no, he's not.

18:50.123 --> 18:52.250
Am I interrupting?

18:52.325 --> 18:58.093
Oh, uh, not at all. We were just
doing some last-minute tests on Buster.

18:58.164 --> 18:59.688
Yeah.

18:59.766 --> 19:03.361
Uh, Sherman, can I talk to you
in private for just a second?

19:07.407 --> 19:10.774
Sherman, I got a call today,

19:10.844 --> 19:14.302
and, well, I've been offered a full professorship
at the University of Maine.

19:14.380 --> 19:19.841
University of Maine? But,
Denise, that's in Maine. Yeah.

19:20.920 --> 19:23.514
Oh.

19:23.590 --> 19:27.617
Well, uh, that's a fine department
over there in Maine.

19:27.694 --> 19:30.891
It is gonna be a...

19:30.964 --> 19:33.262
tremendous loss to Wellman, though.

19:33.333 --> 19:37.269
Well, I haven't decided
to leave just yet. You haven't?

19:37.337 --> 19:40.033
Well, no, I mean-

19:40.106 --> 19:42.904
There's something
very important to me here,

19:42.976 --> 19:46.343
and I'm not so sure
I can just leave it behind.

19:46.412 --> 19:50.542
Well, Denise, you can finish
the research we started on your own.

19:50.617 --> 19:55.281
Sherman, I'm not talking
about research. Really?

19:55.355 --> 19:57.915
Sherman,
you're ver special to me.

20:03.329 --> 20:05.991
Oh, well, uh,
I didn't...

20:06.065 --> 20:08.659
thinkyou and I
would ever- ever-

20:08.735 --> 20:12.000
because of-

20:12.071 --> 20:14.562
How can I put it?
Because I'm- Big.

20:14.641 --> 20:19.101
Yeah. I was gonna say fat,
but, yeah.

20:19.179 --> 20:22.615
Big is better, yep.

20:22.682 --> 20:27.415
Sherman, that doesn't matter to me.
What matters to me is that...

20:27.487 --> 20:31.321
you're kind and decent.

20:33.526 --> 20:37.462
You are...
the most brilliant man I've ever known.

20:40.533 --> 20:44.367
Uh, speaking of which, I shouldn't keep you
from your research,

20:44.437 --> 20:46.166
so, um, I'll talk to you later.

20:46.239 --> 20:49.174
Okay, I'll see you soon.

20:54.247 --> 20:56.181
My goodness.

21:19.272 --> 21:21.740
Professor? You okay?

21:25.144 --> 21:29.046
Yeah. I just don't wanna
hurt her, Jason.

21:29.115 --> 21:31.743
Then you won't.

21:33.753 --> 21:36.745
Hey, you can control Buddy.

21:39.626 --> 21:44.120
You know, it's funny how you get used to certain
things in life, you know?

21:44.197 --> 21:48.861
You get used to being overweight.
I know I did.

21:48.935 --> 21:50.869
You even get used to people
making fun of you.

21:54.107 --> 21:57.702
Somewhere along the line,
I got used to being alone.

21:59.946 --> 22:03.347
And I just don't wanna
be alone anymore.

22:49.982 --> 22:52.382
Denise! Denise!

22:54.019 --> 22:56.112
Oh, Sherman,
the flowers are beautiful.

22:56.188 --> 22:59.021
But what are you doing down there?
Please, come inside.

22:59.091 --> 23:01.457
Just a minute. Let me do something first.
Come here, guys.

23:11.303 --> 23:13.771
Denise,
I just wanna say that...

23:13.839 --> 23:16.467
working along side you
this past year,

23:16.541 --> 23:19.271
getting to know you
and be close to you-

23:19.344 --> 23:22.108
it's been the most
wonderful time of my life.

23:22.180 --> 23:25.616
The most wonderful time
of his life

23:27.119 --> 23:29.781
How lovely.

23:29.855 --> 23:32.323
I'd just like to say that-

23:32.391 --> 23:35.724
it doesn't matter if you wanna
take that other job or if you wanna stay here.

23:35.794 --> 23:39.252
What matters to me most
is that you're happy.

23:39.331 --> 23:42.425
Denise, I have something
that I wanna ask you.

23:42.501 --> 23:45.299
He wants to ask you

23:48.106 --> 23:50.336
Denise-
Denise Gaines-

23:50.409 --> 23:53.572
Yes, Sherman?
Denise, will you-

23:53.645 --> 23:55.579
Well, ask her!

23:55.647 --> 24:00.016
Denise, will you
Hey, Sherman. You hear me, Sherman?

24:00.085 --> 24:02.519
Denise, will you-
will you...

24:02.587 --> 24:05.112
let me come up there
and put my beef in your taco?

24:05.190 --> 24:08.284
Put the beef in your taco
What?

24:08.360 --> 24:11.124
Oh, no, no, no, no!

24:11.196 --> 24:13.187
That's not what I meant to say,
Denise. That was a little joke.

24:13.265 --> 24:17.361
A little joke. I wanted to see if you
wanted to go out and get Mexican food.

24:17.436 --> 24:20.633
That's why I said that.
Well, I am kinda hungry, but I'm not-

24:20.706 --> 24:25.643
Yeah, you are, huh?
I bet you could standfor a big ol' Whopper right now.

24:25.711 --> 24:28.009
A big ol' Whopper right now

24:28.080 --> 24:31.880
You're sick!
I got to tell you, I'm a Jumbo Jack man myself.

24:31.950 --> 24:34.043
Yeah, and I'm loaded
with secret sauce.

24:34.119 --> 24:36.280
Yeah! Come on!

24:39.091 --> 24:42.117
Back that thang up!
Yeah!

24:42.194 --> 24:44.321
Come on! Come on!
Yeah!

24:44.396 --> 24:46.830
Yeah!

24:46.898 --> 24:49.366
Come on!
Make it funky!

24:54.639 --> 24:57.233
You're gonna ruin my lawn,
you pervert!

25:00.445 --> 25:03.642
Put on the good ass!

25:03.715 --> 25:07.879
Sherman, I don't know what's gotten into you,
but I don't like it at all!

25:07.953 --> 25:11.354
Hah, way to go, Sherman!
Oh, my goodness!

25:11.423 --> 25:15.189
You haven't seen the last of me, Sherman!
Oh, my goodness, what'd I do?

25:15.260 --> 25:18.024
Denise!
Denise!

25:18.096 --> 25:23.329
I'm gonna pee on myself.
I'm gonna pee in your pants!

26:10.182 --> 26:13.811
Okay, Buddy,
it's time foryou to go.

26:52.991 --> 26:55.789
That's sexy.

26:59.965 --> 27:04.299
You-ou-ou've got
the magic touch

27:04.369 --> 27:07.600
Ooh, hoo
Hey, what you playing that for?

27:07.672 --> 27:12.871
I thought it'd be soothing. It'd be soothing
if you turned that shit off so I can sleep.

27:12.944 --> 27:14.912
Oh, Clesius,
you haven't even looked at me.

27:14.980 --> 27:19.974
I know what you look like. We married for 44
years. I look at you ever day, all day long.

27:20.051 --> 27:22.679
I know just what you look like.
Clesius, please, look at me!

27:22.754 --> 27:25.518
Damn.
Now here we go.

27:29.561 --> 27:32.655
You got a show tonight?
What you got that on for?

27:32.731 --> 27:37.225
Well, if you don't know after 44 years of
marriage, I don't know what to say to you.

27:37.302 --> 27:41.033
You should say good night and take that damn
rag off that lamp before we burn something down.

27:41.106 --> 27:44.473
Hell.

27:44.542 --> 27:46.976
There!

27:49.981 --> 27:52.415
What about Viagra?

27:54.719 --> 27:56.846
Viagra don't work for me.
I've been taking 'em like M&M's.

27:59.357 --> 28:01.450
Look, Clesius,
maybe it's psychosomatic.

28:01.526 --> 28:05.257
I seen on Oprah once that this happen to men
after they get fired.

28:05.330 --> 28:07.491
Um, Imean, retired. You know, sometimes
you lose yourself-esteem.

28:07.565 --> 28:09.533
Lose self-esteem?
I ain't lost no self-esteem.

28:09.601 --> 28:12.434
You're always yapping about it.
You won't never let up! Forget it!

28:12.504 --> 28:15.530
You're like a broken record. Ever time I
turn around, "Clesius, how you feeling now?"

28:15.607 --> 28:18.041
"You got the groove now?"
Ever time I walk in the room,

28:18.109 --> 28:20.509
I don't even wanna hear it. you shake your ass,
tring to get me stimulated.

28:20.578 --> 28:22.341
Go to sleep, please.
Let it happen naturally.

28:22.414 --> 28:25.941
Never mind, Clesius!
Never mind!

28:26.017 --> 28:30.283
I mean, I'm sorry to yell and scream, but you got
too much pressure on me!

28:30.355 --> 28:32.585
You want tenderness?
Ease up on the pressure.

28:32.657 --> 28:35.182
Too much pressure for me.

28:35.260 --> 28:39.754
Slowit down, Isaac.
No, no, baby, I'm overhere.

28:39.831 --> 28:41.765
Now, there they go.

28:41.833 --> 28:45.735
Now, you're fine now.
Isaac, you're a champion.

28:45.804 --> 28:48.364
That's your old-ass mother. Hey!
My mama has a healthy libido.

28:48.440 --> 28:51.102
Gotta slowit down! lain't taking
nobody to the emergency room tonight!

28:51.176 --> 28:54.111
Somebody break their leg,
gonna stay broke this time.

28:54.179 --> 28:57.811
Isaac! Bingo. Pokeno.

28:58.912 --> 29:02.848
Professor? Professor?
Hey.

29:02.916 --> 29:06.181
Professor?
Hey, Professor!

29:06.253 --> 29:09.245
Wake up.
Oh. Oh, Jason.

29:09.322 --> 29:12.587
My God, what happened?

29:15.428 --> 29:17.362
Buddy.
I had to get rid of Buddy.

29:17.430 --> 29:20.263
What?
He had to go.

29:20.333 --> 29:23.166
You could've killed yourself.
I mean, who knows?

29:23.236 --> 29:25.966
This could affect your coordination,
your neurological system.

29:26.039 --> 29:28.530
It could even affect your intelligence. We don't
even know if this is gonna work.

29:30.210 --> 29:32.144
Only one way to fii nd out.

30:03.577 --> 30:05.977
Okay, Sherman, what
is this about? Denise.

30:06.046 --> 30:08.276
I'm so glad you came.
You know, I almost didn't come.

30:08.348 --> 30:10.282
Well, I'm awful glad you did.

30:10.350 --> 30:13.285
Listen to me, Denise.
Listen.

30:13.353 --> 30:15.446
You know, fireflies,
when they're searchingfor a mate,

30:15.522 --> 30:19.014
the way they findone another
is they emit apheromone,

30:19.092 --> 30:21.253
and I've synthesized it
into a spray form.

30:21.328 --> 30:25.992
Wait a minute.
You brought me out here for an experiment?

30:26.066 --> 30:27.863
Denise, wait, please! Just hear
me out! Please, don't leave.

30:27.934 --> 30:30.198
Sherman, why did you act
that way the other night?

30:31.605 --> 30:34.267
Well, Denise,

30:36.209 --> 30:39.372
when I found out that you might
be leaving, it just got me all messed up inside.

30:39.446 --> 30:41.380
I said some things
I really didn't mean at all.

30:41.448 --> 30:44.849
It was- It was like
there was another person inside me...

30:44.918 --> 30:48.183
who didn't appreciate how wonderful you
are to me and how special you are to me.

30:48.255 --> 30:51.816
And-And-
But thatside of me is gone now.

30:51.892 --> 30:55.225
I got rid of that person forever.
You'I I never see that ugly face again.

30:55.295 --> 30:58.628
I just want you to know that for sure.
That's why I wanted you to come out here tonight.

30:58.698 --> 31:01.166
Just- Just bear with me,
please.

31:18.585 --> 31:21.349
Hope my little friends
might be able to...

31:21.421 --> 31:23.981
say it better than me.

31:31.898 --> 31:34.992
Yes, Sherman Klump,
I will.

31:35.068 --> 31:38.060
Will you really? Really? Really.

31:38.138 --> 31:40.106
Yes. I will. I really will. You will?

31:40.173 --> 31:44.234
Yeah!
Yeah!

31:47.914 --> 31:50.280
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

31:54.321 --> 31:56.619
Come on, Buster.
Time to go home.

31:56.690 --> 31:59.318
That's right. That's right.
Time to go home.

31:59.392 --> 32:02.225
Now wait. Sit.
Good boy.

32:02.295 --> 32:05.230
Wait for Uncle "J."
Stud.

32:55.081 --> 32:57.481
Buster!

32:59.853 --> 33:03.084
Hey, Buster, where'd you
go, boy? Here's a good boy.

33:11.331 --> 33:15.028
Ohhhh, Sherman,
Sherman, Sherman!

33:15.101 --> 33:18.434
My baby's finally getting
married, married, married!

33:18.505 --> 33:21.133
Oh, Sherman! I'm so
happy for you, Sherman.

33:21.207 --> 33:23.698
You're finally
gonna get some.

33:29.282 --> 33:34.219
Tell me something good

33:34.287 --> 33:36.653
Whoo!

33:36.723 --> 33:40.489
Tell me that you
love me, yeah

33:40.560 --> 33:43.893
Tell me something

33:43.963 --> 33:47.023
Good
Oh, baby, baby

33:47.100 --> 33:50.228
Come on now, dance with me,
girl. You look fantastic.

33:52.405 --> 33:54.168
If you two can stop
getting all jiggy with it,

33:54.240 --> 33:56.970
perhaps I can give you something
to really celebrate. Oh, yes, sir.

33:57.043 --> 33:58.977
Yes, Dean, what's that?
Oh, nothing much.

33:59.045 --> 34:02.674
A letter from Phleer Pharmaceuticals, largest
drug company in the world.

34:02.749 --> 34:05.718
I told them about your little discover, and they
made a preemptive offer.

34:05.785 --> 34:09.551
Not too shabby, eh?

34:09.621 --> 34:11.556
A hundred and fiifty
million dollars!

34:11.623 --> 34:14.184
Oh, my God, Sherman!

34:14.260 --> 34:16.888
A hundred and fiifty million dollars!
Oh, my goodness.

34:16.963 --> 34:19.261
Isn't that wonderful?
Now, remember, that money belongs to Wellman.

34:19.331 --> 34:23.268
All you have to do is prove to Phleer the formula
works at the press conference I set up.

34:23.335 --> 34:28.933
Yeah! Of-Of course.
$150 million- my mind's all scribble-scrabble.

34:32.579 --> 34:35.446
Oh, Mama, Ican't wait to see what she
looks like in my old wedding dress.

34:35.514 --> 34:38.348
I can't wait to see, Mama.
She gonna-

34:38.418 --> 34:41.284
Oh!

34:43.690 --> 34:47.524
Oh, seeing you in that dress
take me right back to the time I got married.

34:47.594 --> 34:50.563
It's beautiful.
Oh, you look wonderful. Show Mama what you look like.

34:50.630 --> 34:53.757
Mama, look at this.
Oh, you look so lovely.

34:53.833 --> 34:57.929
Oh, be careful now.
She looks fabulous in it, don't she, Mama? Look at her.

34:58.004 --> 35:02.464
Denise, you still remember what I told you
about marital relations?

35:02.542 --> 35:06.478
Oh, Mama. Denise, look. Try this
pie. I made it with Snickers.

35:06.546 --> 35:10.346
Now, don't be shy.
Come on over here.

35:10.416 --> 35:13.442
Oh, that's pretty.
Okay, if you get bored with your man,

35:13.520 --> 35:16.887
it's perfectly okay topicture
someone else's headon his body.

35:16.956 --> 35:18.890
Right. Ooh, you got
a little waist, girl.

35:18.958 --> 35:22.724
That's right. That gentleman,
Stone Phillips, on NBC.

35:22.795 --> 35:26.424
You know, Granny, I really don't think
I need to do that.

35:26.499 --> 35:30.993
Isaac, you don't need to hear this.
It's private. It's private!

35:31.070 --> 35:33.095
We gonna talk
girl talk now, baby.

35:33.173 --> 35:36.939
From time to time, I have fantasies about
Stone Phillipsfrom NBC.

35:37.010 --> 35:41.447
Mama. Mama, quiet.
It's true. It's the same dream all the time.

35:41.514 --> 35:44.244
I'm in a tobacco barn.
Stone Phillips is my coworker,

35:44.317 --> 35:48.617
andhe don't never have on no shirt in the
dream, and I don't never have on no pants.

35:48.688 --> 35:51.851
It's the nougat that makes it
chewy. And I stand on this ladder,

35:51.925 --> 35:55.952
Stone Phillipsget a little peek of heaven
I got up myskirt.

35:56.029 --> 35:59.055
I invite him up the ladder,
he come up the ladder and throw me on the tobacco.

35:59.132 --> 36:02.932
And we start going at it
like two mice.

36:03.002 --> 36:06.267
Stone, Stone, Stone.
Mm!

36:06.339 --> 36:09.035
Oh, I think that's
a wonderful fiit.

36:09.108 --> 36:11.668
I do too.

36:13.780 --> 36:18.808
Oh, you're so sweet. Sherman
and Denise! Sherman and Denise!

36:18.885 --> 36:23.481
Marriage, marriage, marriage, marriage,
marriage. They gonna get married, Mama.

36:23.556 --> 36:25.490
Ooh, I'm so happy.

36:25.558 --> 36:27.492
Welcome back. Marriage,
marriage, marriage, marriage.

36:29.929 --> 36:32.159
Nutty, nutty, nutty
my love for you

36:32.232 --> 36:34.530
Ican't believe
my dreams come true

36:34.601 --> 36:36.967
I've finally foundsomebody
whose heart is true

36:37.036 --> 36:39.732
And best of all is you're
nutty, nutty, nutty forme

36:39.806 --> 36:43.902
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

36:43.977 --> 36:46.283
Well, well, well, we've seen quite a bit
ofeach othertoday.

36:46.417 --> 36:49.113
Now strip down to your shorts. Right.

36:50.921 --> 36:54.152
I suppose you thought I was gonna object to
a strip search, didn't you, Chief?

36:54.224 --> 36:56.749
Keep your clothes on, please.
Don't nobody wanna see that!

37:00.030 --> 37:03.329
Here's my wallet. Why don't you
check foryourself?

37:03.400 --> 37:07.063
Yeah, hold that stomach in,
Robert!

37:07.137 --> 37:09.264
What's his problem?

37:09.339 --> 37:11.671
I don't know, but enough
is enough. Excuse me, sir.

37:11.742 --> 37:16.941
Young man, will you please keep it down just
a little bit 'cause we're trying to watch-

37:17.014 --> 37:19.346
Just when you thought it was
safe to go back to the theaters.

37:23.654 --> 37:27.181
Hello, fat ass!

37:27.257 --> 37:29.851
Maybe we should get going.
I don't feel too good all of a sudden. Let's go.

37:29.927 --> 37:32.157
Come on, let's go somewhere else.
Sherman, who was that?

37:32.229 --> 37:36.165
I don't know. I didn't really get a good look at him.
Sherman! Sherman Klump!

37:36.233 --> 37:39.202
You still been hitting them Happy
Meals. You haven't changed an inch.

37:39.269 --> 37:43.603
You remember me
Buddy Love. We used to both chase that girl, Carla, at the same time.

37:43.674 --> 37:47.110
You ever hit that?
Miss Purty and I were just friends.

37:47.177 --> 37:50.010
"Just friends"-
I guess that means you didn't hit it, huh?

37:50.080 --> 37:53.072
Who's your new friend? She sure is
fii ne. Yes, fii ne. What's your name?

37:53.150 --> 37:56.085
Sherman, suddenly I don't feel
so well. Can we leave, please?

37:56.153 --> 37:58.383
Yes, let's go, please. Can I talk to Sherman
for one second? Then you can have him.

37:58.455 --> 38:01.185
One second, please. I gotta talk to you.
We gonna have a little boy talk.

38:01.258 --> 38:04.557
Excuse us. Sherman, how you doing, baby?
What do you want here?

38:04.628 --> 38:06.721
A little respect.
You left me all by myself in that test tube...

38:06.797 --> 38:09.391
without a card or a letter,
and now I want a divorce.

38:09.466 --> 38:12.299
And this is a community property state,
so I want my share.

38:12.369 --> 38:17.966
Want your share of what?
The youth formula we invented!

38:18.041 --> 38:21.067
You mean, the youth formula that I invented.
Oh, no way, Buddy, no way.

38:21.144 --> 38:23.476
Who you grounding, fat boy? You
grounding me? - I haven't grounded-

38:23.547 --> 38:26.948
I was hoping we could do this like gentlemen.
Come on, Sherman.

38:27.017 --> 38:29.577
You're gonna make me do something
nasty to you, Sherman. I'll do something nasty.

38:29.653 --> 38:33.419
Sherman!
See you soon, Sherman!

38:33.490 --> 38:38.093
Sherman!

38:40.564 --> 38:43.226
What the hell
are you looking at?

38:43.300 --> 38:46.736
Oh, thank you, Sherman.

38:46.803 --> 38:50.068
What else did I get from Sherman?
What does this say?

38:50.140 --> 38:54.702
"Phleer Pharmaceuticals. "
$150 mill- $150 million.

38:54.778 --> 38:59.340
I think Buddy's going shopping.

39:11.328 --> 39:14.491
Professor, I got here as fast as I could.

39:14.565 --> 39:17.466
I've got to hide this formula
before Buddy gets to it. Good idea.

39:17.534 --> 39:20.526
I found something
I think you should look at.

39:20.604 --> 39:25.041
When I left here last night, everthing was fii ne.
I mean, this was not here.

39:25.108 --> 39:29.442
Good Lord. Buddy must've recombined from the genomic
sequence I extracted.

39:29.513 --> 39:32.676
This doesn't make any sense. He's
just a fragment of genetic information.

39:32.749 --> 39:35.445
He's nothing without a strand of DNA
to graft himself onto.

39:35.519 --> 39:38.113
Where-Where did he get it?

39:38.188 --> 39:40.122
Mm.

39:40.190 --> 39:42.852
Just a second here.

39:45.028 --> 39:47.019
Buster!

39:55.806 --> 39:58.673
Thank you so much.
Leanne Guilford.

39:58.742 --> 40:01.836
President of Acquisitions.
Buddy Love, president of Love Industries.

40:01.912 --> 40:03.880
Allergies?

40:03.947 --> 40:06.882
No. Do you have a dog?
Yes, I do- a Yorkie.

40:06.950 --> 40:09.612
Oh. She's driving me crazy right now.

40:09.686 --> 40:12.883
Bitch.
Excuse me.

40:12.956 --> 40:16.756
It's a female dog that you have,
and she's in heat, right? Yes. How did you know that?

40:16.827 --> 40:18.886
Let's just say I have
a sixth sense about those things. Is this her?

40:18.962 --> 40:22.921
Yeah, little Courtney.
Ooh, nasty.

40:23.000 --> 40:26.163
Mr. Love, maybe we'd better do this
another time. No, this is the perfect time.

40:26.236 --> 40:31.003
Let's do this right now. This is the perfect time
to talk about my youth formula.

40:31.074 --> 40:33.907
We are already committed to purchasing
Professor Klump's formula.

40:33.977 --> 40:36.070
Oh, Professor Klump's formula?
That's if it works.

40:36.146 --> 40:41.174
Let's just that although he's a brilliant scientist,
at times, he can be unstable.

40:41.251 --> 40:43.185
Yes.
Huh.

40:43.253 --> 40:45.278
Interesting. Yes, now, my formula works...

40:45.355 --> 40:50.588
and can be yours for the price
of $149 million, if you act now, pretty lady.

40:50.661 --> 40:54.791
Forgive me for being blunt, but you don't
expect me tojust take your word for it, do you?

40:54.865 --> 40:57.595
Oh, no, not at all. Just say when,
and I'll make it available to you.

40:57.668 --> 41:00.193
All right.

41:00.270 --> 41:03.103
If Klump can't deliver and you
can prove your formula's better, Yes?

41:03.173 --> 41:06.233
Phleer would have to seriously consider it.
Is that right?

41:06.309 --> 41:09.244
I've got to go to a meeting.
Can we reschedule for later? We certainly can.

41:09.312 --> 41:13.646
Good. How about Wednesday, 7:00?
Perfect. Wednesday at 7:00.

41:13.717 --> 41:17.585
Bring the formula.
Yes.

41:17.654 --> 41:21.613
Excuse me. Where's your restroom?
Down the hall, to the left.

41:21.692 --> 41:24.126
Thank you. You finished with this? Sure.

41:44.948 --> 41:47.610
Whoo, whoo!

41:47.684 --> 41:51.120
What the hell you looking at?
Huh? Oh!

42:00.697 --> 42:04.189
Good God! What "good
God"? I went on the paper!

42:11.241 --> 42:14.176
Genetic anomalies can occur...

42:14.244 --> 42:18.010
in any living organism
through- through-

42:18.081 --> 42:21.608
Come on now, people.
Spontaneous mutation.

42:21.685 --> 42:26.213
Now what is it that ourgenetic codes
can determine about us?

42:26.289 --> 42:29.258
Miss Tate?
Uh, they can determine...

42:29.326 --> 42:32.887
whether you have blue eyes
or pouty lips or a cute butt.

42:32.963 --> 42:35.056
Stuff like that.

42:35.132 --> 42:37.225
Right, right, precisely.
Very good.

42:37.300 --> 42:41.566
But what about random nucleotide
polymorphisms, Professor? Excellent question.

42:41.638 --> 42:48.175
Random nucleotide
polymorphisms-

42:50.781 --> 42:54.148
Random nucleotide-

43:00.056 --> 43:02.024
I ain't got a clue.

43:08.765 --> 43:11.893
Who knows? This could affect your coordination,
your neurologicalsystem.

43:11.968 --> 43:16.166
I mean, it could even affect your intelligence.
What was I talking about?

43:16.239 --> 43:20.266
Genetic anomalies.
Yes, genetic anomalies. As I was saying-

43:32.622 --> 43:36.854
Think you're
pretty smart, huh, Molly?

43:39.129 --> 43:41.529
Not gonna beat me again.

43:57.431 --> 43:59.695
Oh.

43:59.766 --> 44:03.668
That makes five times
in a row now. Hey.

44:03.737 --> 44:07.605
Can I talk to you for a second?
Jason, yes, please, come in.

44:10.911 --> 44:14.244
Look, I know you think you're feeling fine,
but I ran some more tests anyway.

44:14.314 --> 44:17.078
Really?
Yeah. When you extracted Buddy,

44:17.150 --> 44:22.588
somehow it altered the gene that regulates neurotransmitter
activity to the cerebral cortex.

44:22.656 --> 44:26.888
Uh,Jason, all these big words are really perplexing to me.
Can you talk in plain English?

44:29.429 --> 44:31.897
You're losing your intelligence, sir.

44:34.968 --> 44:38.131
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

44:40.507 --> 44:43.169
I know.
I can feel it.

44:43.243 --> 44:46.644
I can't even beat Molly,
and she's the dumbest hamster we got.

44:46.713 --> 44:49.682
Jason, my presentation's
in two days.

44:49.749 --> 44:52.183
Now what am I gonna do?

45:03.797 --> 45:08.097
Oh, mygoodness.
Buddy.

45:18.445 --> 45:21.608
Oh, thank God.

45:34.828 --> 45:37.422
Hey, how's it going there, Sherman?
Yeah, Daddy, you startled me.

45:37.497 --> 45:40.466
What's that you got there, son?
The youth juice.

45:40.534 --> 45:44.095
Um, um, my formula. I was wondering if I could
keep it here for safe keeping.

45:44.170 --> 45:47.196
Oh, yeah, leave it in the refrigerator.
Ain't nobody gonna bother it.

45:47.274 --> 45:50.300
You allright? You looka little
strained. What's going on?

45:50.377 --> 45:54.211
Well, Daddy, you know,
I kinda got a lot on my mind.

45:54.281 --> 45:57.273
Really, I do. I guess I've been a little
worried about my presentation and all.

45:57.350 --> 45:59.944
Worried about your presentation?
You ain't got nothing to be worried about.

46:00.020 --> 46:03.683
We gonna be watching you on TV, supporting you,
and you should be proud. We proud.

46:03.757 --> 46:05.725
I know I'm proud. I tell you that. You ain't got
nothing to worried-

46:05.792 --> 46:09.159
You're gonna be doing just great.
Ah!

46:09.229 --> 46:12.528
I didn't hit you that hard. Don't act
like a little bitch. By the way, Sherman,

46:12.599 --> 46:16.035
how many people can say
that they raised a genius?

46:16.102 --> 46:18.969
I can.

46:23.109 --> 46:27.068
Worried about his presentation?
That's a good one there.

46:33.720 --> 46:36.553
Ooh, is this supposed to be that hard?
Yeah, let it set a while.

46:36.623 --> 46:38.591
Don't worry if it burns a little bit.
That's natural.

46:38.658 --> 46:41.855
All right, you the expert, Chantal.
Workyour magic, girl,

46:41.928 --> 46:43.862
'cause Denise's motheris coming
to this bachelorette party,

46:43.930 --> 46:46.421
and if she's as stunning as Denise,
I got to besparkling.

46:46.499 --> 46:48.797
Honey, you gonna blind
their asses.

46:48.868 --> 46:52.099
When you walk in that door,
they gonna think you're Tyra Banks.

46:52.172 --> 46:54.697
Oh, did I tell you the news?

46:54.774 --> 46:56.833
Leon got
one of them penis pumps.

46:56.910 --> 47:00.437
Penis pumps?
What'd he do with it? Mm-hmm.

47:00.513 --> 47:03.573
Supposed to pump it up or something.
Does it work?

47:03.650 --> 47:07.279
Just on the tip. Now that thing
look like a portabello mushroom.

47:07.354 --> 47:10.846
Isaac all natural.

47:10.924 --> 47:13.620
Soon as I walk in the room,
ten-hut.

47:13.693 --> 47:18.756
You know, I'm thinking about
having a little work done myself.

47:18.832 --> 47:21.096
The other day,
I got out the shower,

47:21.167 --> 47:23.397
and I bent down
to reach for a towel,

47:23.470 --> 47:25.802
and I felt a sharp pain
in my chest.

47:25.872 --> 47:30.536
Shot through my chest
and up around my back, down my spine.

47:30.610 --> 47:33.738
I thought, "Oh, Lord. " I thought
I was dying. I bent over and looked,

47:33.813 --> 47:36.907
and I was standing
on my own titty.

47:38.785 --> 47:41.413
You ain't have to get no breast
reduction. Just be more careful.

47:41.488 --> 47:44.321
Both feet too.
Both feet on it.

47:48.895 --> 47:52.956
All right, what the hell you old
hens cackling about? You ready to go?

47:53.033 --> 47:54.796
No, not quite.
I'll be ready in a minute.

47:54.868 --> 47:58.395
She still got to set up a few more minutes.
Have some more wine, girl.

47:58.471 --> 48:00.462
Ooh, girl, I don't know if I
should. I already had two glasses.

48:00.540 --> 48:03.100
Oh, go on, live a little.
Make your hair look better.

48:05.845 --> 48:08.405
Have mercy.
Yeah,just like Ifigured.

48:08.481 --> 48:12.008
You sit up here all day, getting
sloshed and talking about us men.

48:12.085 --> 48:15.987
Clesius, have you ever heard the expression, "mercy hump"?
Say what?

48:16.056 --> 48:19.116
'Cause that's what you been getting all these years
mercy humps.

48:19.192 --> 48:22.184
Stop it.
You out your goddamn mind. Let me tell you something.

48:22.262 --> 48:24.492
He ain't got nothing
but a limp doodle.

48:25.598 --> 48:28.590
Oops.
Sorry.

48:28.668 --> 48:30.659
Gotta get ya.

48:30.737 --> 48:34.002
Clesius!
Oh, look what you've done! Oh.

48:34.074 --> 48:37.271
Ah-
You girls are crazy. I'm leaving.

48:37.343 --> 48:40.870
Oh, Clesius, Clesius, wait! Clesius!
Oh, Clesius! I don't believe it.

48:40.947 --> 48:43.814
Clesius, I only told her 'cause
she got so much experience in sexual matters.

48:43.883 --> 48:47.216
I ain't nothing but a big damn joke
to you, ain't I? Tell the whole world!

48:47.287 --> 48:50.620
Her husband ain't nothing but a
big ol' pile of worth less crap!

48:50.690 --> 48:53.124
Clesius!
Clesius!

48:54.427 --> 48:56.361
Oh.

48:58.898 --> 49:01.731
I'm just glad they're back in town
so you can fii nally meet them.

49:01.801 --> 49:04.895
I'm extremely nervous because I
really want to make a good impression.

49:04.971 --> 49:06.939
Sherman, there's no reason
foryou to be nervous.

49:07.006 --> 49:10.840
My parents are very down-to-earth people,
and they're gonna love you.

49:10.910 --> 49:14.903
I guess it's not like they're rocket scientists.
Well, actually, they are.

49:14.981 --> 49:18.144
Daddy!
Sweetheart!

49:18.218 --> 49:21.847
Great to see you. You must be Sherman,
the genius who's marring my daughter.

49:21.921 --> 49:24.822
I guess that's me.

49:29.629 --> 49:34.760
They think I'm old. They think I'm
worn-out, huh? I'm gonna show all of'em.

49:36.970 --> 49:40.406
Screw the golden years.
And here's to youth!

49:49.482 --> 49:51.416
That's some nasty mess.

49:55.054 --> 49:57.420
I don't feel no-

50:16.609 --> 50:19.806
Damn, that was
some nasty stuff!

50:19.879 --> 50:23.576
Oh, I feel as strange as hell.
Oh! Hey, get your ass-

50:23.650 --> 50:26.084
Who the hell are you?
Who you put-

50:33.560 --> 50:35.494
It worked.
It worked!

50:37.564 --> 50:40.260
Papa's got a brand-new bag

50:52.478 --> 50:56.073
Yeah!

50:58.651 --> 51:00.585
Oh, what a beautiful bird.

51:00.653 --> 51:03.281
Oh, Crackers has been in our
family more than 50 years.

51:03.356 --> 51:07.122
Hmm? Fifty years.
He's older than I am.

51:07.193 --> 51:11.289
Sherman, your fly. Your fly.
Yeah, he can fly all over.

51:11.364 --> 51:13.958
No, no, no, zip your pants.

51:14.033 --> 51:19.519
Oh, my goodness. Excuse me. I felt
- I felt a little breeze.

51:19.653 --> 51:22.053
So, uh, genomic extractions.

51:22.122 --> 51:24.249
Fascinating.

51:24.324 --> 51:28.590
But the whole concept ofremoving faultygenes
must haveyou in an ethicalquandary.

51:28.662 --> 51:30.892
E- Excuse me. Ethical?

51:30.964 --> 51:34.923
Oh, yes, I don't know much
about "Ethicals", to be perfectly honest with you.

51:35.001 --> 51:37.162
But the "Quandar"-
I don't like the Japanese cars.

51:37.237 --> 51:38.602
I don't like
the Ethical Quandary.

51:38.672 --> 51:42.631
I'm a Volvo man myself.
Well, yeah.

51:44.044 --> 51:46.274
Oh!

51:50.450 --> 51:55.080
Sherman is known as the leading expert
in genomic extractions.

51:55.155 --> 51:58.283
Give us a little preview of the speech you're going to make
at the press conference.

52:02.662 --> 52:06.530
Say what now?
I know we would never be able to keep up,

52:06.599 --> 52:09.534
but is there some way that you could explain it
in layman terms?

52:09.602 --> 52:12.469
Oh, you'd like me
to explain to you?

52:12.539 --> 52:15.474
Yes. Well, I would love
to. I would be honored.

52:15.542 --> 52:18.409
It's really quite simple.
This corn, for instance-

52:18.478 --> 52:21.970
This piece ofcorn here
can represent a strand of DNA.

52:22.048 --> 52:24.016
And these little-

52:24.084 --> 52:27.178
the individual-
the bumpy things that go-

52:27.253 --> 52:29.517
The Green Giant calls them
"niblets. " Uh, niblets.

52:29.589 --> 52:32.649
These niblets represent each gene,
and they determine everything about you.

52:32.726 --> 52:36.719
For instance, Mrs. Gaines,
let's say if a person was to have big titties, like you.

52:36.796 --> 52:39.026
Sherman!
I'm sorry. Big titties.

52:39.099 --> 52:41.693
No, breasts. Scratch it.
Get off you. On me.

52:41.768 --> 52:44.430
Now, I have a big ass. Never mind that.

52:48.975 --> 52:53.708
What we're attempting to do here is
to extract the, uh, the bad, badgenes.

52:53.780 --> 52:56.271
Extract that titty out.
Andass comes out.

52:56.349 --> 52:58.283
And just leave
the good genes,

52:58.351 --> 53:00.546
which is very simple
if you think about it.

53:02.522 --> 53:04.285
Just ignore that.

53:04.357 --> 53:07.053
Please ignore those.
Those are the badgenes.

53:07.127 --> 53:11.063
What I'm really tring to do is go
deep, deep down into the gene structure,

53:11.131 --> 53:13.224
which oftentimes
is much more difficult.

53:16.336 --> 53:19.100
Crackers!

53:19.172 --> 53:21.106
Oh, goodness!

53:23.443 --> 53:26.435
I'm- I'm so-
so sorry about that.

53:26.513 --> 53:30.244
My pants got caught in the thing
and they pulled it on out.

53:30.316 --> 53:32.477
His wings istwitching a little bit,
so he's allright.

53:35.355 --> 53:37.846
Buddy Love.

53:37.924 --> 53:40.552
Mr. Love. Leanne Guilford.
Yes, Miss Guilford. How are you?

53:40.627 --> 53:43.391
You forgotten we have an appointment
right now? I had a hard time getting a cab.

53:43.463 --> 53:47.331
I'm on my way.
I'll wait for a few more minutes and then I'm leaving.

53:47.400 --> 53:50.233
Very good. I'll see you soon. All right.

53:50.303 --> 53:52.999
Yes!

53:53.072 --> 53:55.006
Whoo!
This isgreat!

53:55.074 --> 53:58.339
Sir, uh, please don't do
that. It's kind ofdangerous.

53:58.411 --> 54:02.370
You work here! Work here!

54:04.651 --> 54:06.448
Dynamite!

54:06.519 --> 54:08.453
Yeah! Whoo!

54:08.521 --> 54:11.718
Hey, let me have a seven and seven.
Coming up.

54:13.893 --> 54:17.192
You about the fii nest-looking
thing I seen in a long time.

54:17.263 --> 54:19.959
Well, thank you very much.
You pretty damn foxy yourself, baby.

54:20.033 --> 54:23.127
A lot of young men
are intimidated by an older woman.

54:23.203 --> 54:25.194
Is that right?
Well, let me tell you something.

54:25.271 --> 54:28.536
You look pretty damn young to me. In
fact, let me tell you something, baby.

54:28.608 --> 54:31.042
You just about the-
You-

54:32.445 --> 54:36.609
Yeah, you look good. Pretty
fine. Foxy fine and young.

54:36.683 --> 54:39.914
Excuse me one second.
Yes, yes, yes.

54:39.986 --> 54:43.979
Get away from my woman.
Mind your own business, Willie.

54:44.057 --> 54:46.787
What?
It's over between us. He just won't accept it.

54:46.860 --> 54:50.296
Willie, she said it's over between y'all. Besides,
you getting the wrong idea.

54:50.363 --> 54:53.958
Outside. Outside. I'm tired of this
shit. Say what? Who you pushing?

54:54.033 --> 54:56.593
Not again, Willie.
Willie, what's wrong with you?

54:56.669 --> 54:59.331
All right, enough is enough!
This is going too damn far!

54:59.405 --> 55:03.136
You gonna make me have to put my foot in your ass.
I'm gonna tell you straight up.

55:03.209 --> 55:07.168
I don't wanna have to hurt you,
Pops! Pops? I'll "pop" your ass.

55:07.247 --> 55:09.511
Would you please put
your clothes back on?

55:09.582 --> 55:12.244
You'll hurt yourself.
You look like a roast chicken.

55:13.486 --> 55:15.818
That was a lucky shot.

55:18.057 --> 55:22.687
Okay, that's it.
Come on, fool. Get your ass up. Come on.

55:22.762 --> 55:25.287
You're crazy.

55:27.367 --> 55:31.133
What the hell is this?
Am I supposed to believe that you know "bujitsu"?

55:31.204 --> 55:32.637
Sayonara, sucker.

55:41.114 --> 55:43.048
All right.

55:43.116 --> 55:45.949
Meter reads 3.90. Here's
4.00. Keep the dime. Jerk.

55:46.019 --> 55:49.455
Ah, the lovely Miss Guilford.
Where you on your way to?

55:49.522 --> 55:52.286
Home.
Home? What do you mean? We got business to talk.

55:52.358 --> 55:56.454
All you seem to be is talk. I'm starting to think
you don't even have a formula.

55:56.529 --> 55:58.463
Oh-
We're gonna stick with Klump.

55:58.531 --> 56:01.523
Stick with Klump? I just got off the phone
with my research people in Langley, Virginia.

56:01.601 --> 56:05.037
They're working out all the minorkinks. We gonna
have a formula any moment now.

56:05.104 --> 56:07.402
Hey! Klump's formula sucks!

56:12.612 --> 56:14.842
All right, little man.

56:14.914 --> 56:17.576
I've been
real patient.

56:17.650 --> 56:21.313
I told you I'd mess you up.

56:27.493 --> 56:30.758
Oh, you scared now, huh?
Bring your little butt back here.

56:30.830 --> 56:32.764
I'm tired ofyour-

56:34.734 --> 56:37.567
Damn.

56:37.637 --> 56:39.502
He done loosen
my tooth too.

56:45.678 --> 56:48.476
So that's where
Sherman's been hiding it.

56:48.548 --> 56:51.073
Klumpville.
Chunkytown.

56:51.150 --> 56:53.880
Big-ass City.

57:03.596 --> 57:07.123
Clesius. Clesius. Lord have mercy.
What have you been all evening?

57:07.200 --> 57:09.293
I've been so worried.
Wait. Don't turn on the light.

57:09.369 --> 57:13.430
Leave the light out.
Oh, Clesius, I'm so sorry about what happened tonight.

57:13.506 --> 57:15.770
Yeah, well- Anna,

57:15.842 --> 57:18.936
you remember
when we first met?

57:19.012 --> 57:21.708
Ofcourse I remember.
Back at the state fair. Why?

57:21.781 --> 57:25.683
Yeah, the state fair.
You was working the cotton candy.

57:25.752 --> 57:29.586
Standing looking like an angel. Had
that pink sugar swirling all around you.

57:29.655 --> 57:32.590
I turned to my brother,
and I said three words,

57:32.658 --> 57:35.752
"Mighty fine. "

57:37.830 --> 57:41.596
You must've ate 16 cotton candies
that night, Clesius.

57:41.667 --> 57:44.101
Yeah, well,
I was interested.

57:44.170 --> 57:46.695
I was interested.
I was damn interested.

57:50.510 --> 57:52.671
Closeyoureyes, Anna.
I got a little surprise for you.

57:52.745 --> 57:56.306
Oh, Clesius.

57:56.382 --> 57:59.112
Oh!

57:59.185 --> 58:01.710
Here lam. I'm ready,
andl'm waiting.

58:01.788 --> 58:03.915
Oh, that some nasty stuff.
Okay, what you got for me?

58:03.990 --> 58:07.926
It wouldn't be
a surprise if I told you.

58:07.994 --> 58:10.258
Oh, you always been
such a sexy devil.

58:13.099 --> 58:15.067
Oh, Clesius,
I'm on fire.

58:15.134 --> 58:18.626
Oh, Clesius!
Hurr, Clesius.

58:18.704 --> 58:21.298
Hurr, Clesius!

58:21.374 --> 58:23.672
Hurry, Clesius.
Hurry. Hurry, Clesius.

58:23.743 --> 58:25.938
Yeah, yeah.
I've been waiting so long.

58:26.012 --> 58:29.311
Clesius, I'm on fire.
I know you've been waiting, baby.

58:29.382 --> 58:32.545
Oh, Clesius, this is so romantic.
Yeah, Clesius here now.

58:32.618 --> 58:34.950
I'm on fire. Anna Pearl, Anna Pearl.

58:35.021 --> 58:39.390
Yeah,
I'm gonna put your fire out.

58:39.459 --> 58:42.214
It's okay, baby. It's okay.

58:42.348 --> 58:44.578
Anna, it's me. It's me. It's
Clesius. I'm just young again.

58:44.650 --> 58:47.118
Oh, Lord, Clesius, what
have you done to yourself?

58:47.186 --> 58:49.245
I took some of Sherman's youth juice,
and it's incredible.

58:49.321 --> 58:52.449
I got enough
for both of us too.

58:52.524 --> 58:55.118
Damn. Don't worry about it. I got some more
in the garage. I'm not taking that mess.

58:55.194 --> 58:57.219
I don't want
no magic formula.

58:57.296 --> 59:00.527
What's wrong with you, woman? Don't you wanna be young?
No, I don't wanna be young.

59:00.599 --> 59:04.865
Clesius, we're supposed to be who we
are, andl'm just fine with who lam.

59:04.937 --> 59:08.703
But, obviously, what you're tring
to say is that you'rejust tired...

59:08.774 --> 59:11.971
of the fat, old woman that you got married to.
Oh, no, Anna.

59:12.044 --> 59:14.535
That's not what I'm saying.
That ain't what I'm saying at all.

59:14.613 --> 59:17.605
Downstairs. I think you better sleep
downstairs. Anna, please, no, baby.

59:17.683 --> 59:21.210
But I was just- - Downstairs,
Clesius. I don't wanna hear it.

59:24.890 --> 59:28.223
Oh, Clesius, I'm so
disappointed in you.

59:31.530 --> 59:35.967
I just feel so god-awful terrible
about what happened to Crackers.

59:36.034 --> 59:38.229
Imagine what your parents
must think about me.

59:38.303 --> 59:40.567
Sherman, you were acting
really strange tonight.

59:40.639 --> 59:43.130
Yeah, I know, 'cause,
um, I drank that wine,

59:43.208 --> 59:45.574
and I had cold medicine
early on.

59:45.644 --> 59:48.704
And mixing cold medicine
and wine- that don't mix.

59:48.781 --> 59:50.874
Well, cold medicine
or not,

59:50.949 --> 59:53.440
I'm really worried
about you.

59:53.519 --> 59:55.919
And I really think you
should get a checkup.

59:57.723 --> 01:00:00.419
All right. I will.
Yeah, I will.

01:00:00.492 --> 01:00:02.960
Okay. Go home
and get some rest,

01:00:03.028 --> 01:00:05.997
and first thing in the morning,
I'll make an appointment to get a checkup.

01:00:06.064 --> 01:00:09.158
Good. See you tomorrow.
See you tomorrow.

01:00:09.234 --> 01:00:12.829
Sorry about Crackers. I'm sorry. Okay?
Okay. Okay.

01:00:15.574 --> 01:00:17.508
Mm.

01:00:20.412 --> 01:00:23.540
Pervert.
"Beef in your taco. "

01:00:26.652 --> 01:00:29.746
I'm a pony! I'm a pony!
Mommy, I'm scared.

01:00:29.822 --> 01:00:31.619
Nowback
to the midnight movie.

01:00:36.829 --> 01:00:40.026
A huge asteroid, approximately
1,000 square miles in size,

01:00:40.098 --> 01:00:43.329
is still on
a collision course with Earth.

01:00:46.171 --> 01:00:48.571
Wellman College Professor
Sherman Klump...

01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:53.134
is attempting to plant a nuclear explosive
device deep within the asteroid core,

01:00:53.212 --> 01:00:55.305
which, if effective,
will destroy it.

01:01:00.018 --> 01:01:02.885
Houston, come in.
This is Professor Klump on the asteroid's surface.

01:01:02.955 --> 01:01:05.890
We read you, Professor.
What's your status?

01:01:05.958 --> 01:01:08.927
We've done dug the hole
and planted the nukes.

01:01:08.994 --> 01:01:11.690
Good. Then get back in your shuttle
and get the hell out of there...

01:01:11.763 --> 01:01:14.391
so you can blow
that rock to bits.

01:01:14.466 --> 01:01:17.560
Sherman, you've got 30 seconds
before that asteroid hits. Better hurry.

01:01:17.636 --> 01:01:19.729
The world's counting on it.

01:01:24.576 --> 01:01:27.670
Fifteen seconds.
Sherman, start the detonation sequence now.

01:01:29.248 --> 01:01:31.842
Hello, Houston.
We got a big-assproblem.

01:01:31.917 --> 01:01:35.409
Sherman, you've got to blow up
the asteroid. Press that button!

01:01:35.487 --> 01:01:38.752
I... can't... reach it.
Sherman.

01:01:41.727 --> 01:01:45.424
Sherman, I am your father.
Search your feelings, Sherman.

01:01:45.497 --> 01:01:50.958
There's a force deep down inside you. Use it.
Use your force, Sherman.

01:01:51.036 --> 01:01:53.800
Of course.

01:01:56.909 --> 01:02:01.209
Ah, yes.
The force is strong with you, my son.

01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:03.771
Goddamn.
What the hell was that noise?

01:02:03.849 --> 01:02:07.148
Whew! I think something crawled
up your force and died, Sherman.

01:02:12.858 --> 01:02:17.022
Ten seconds to impact.
My God!

01:02:17.095 --> 01:02:20.462
He didn't plant those charges
on the asteroid. Then where did he plant them?

01:02:22.768 --> 01:02:24.497
Okay.

01:02:24.570 --> 01:02:27.505
Good-bye, Mr. Asteroid.

01:02:27.573 --> 01:02:30.633
This is gonna be good. Yeah.

01:02:30.709 --> 01:02:35.510
Wait a minute. Did I land on the wrong
Oh, shit.

01:02:41.453 --> 01:02:44.513
Oh, no. I done blowed up
the wrong one.

01:02:44.590 --> 01:02:46.490
Good-bye, Sherman.

01:02:46.558 --> 01:02:48.753
Denise, please don't-
It was an accident. Denise-

01:02:48.827 --> 01:02:52.228
I'm sure it'I I just make a little
splash in the ocean. That's all.

01:02:52.297 --> 01:02:54.731
See,just a little, tiny-

01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:57.234
Oh, that ain't tiny
at all, is it?

01:03:04.910 --> 01:03:06.844
I am an idiot.

01:03:10.248 --> 01:03:13.376
Oh, thank you, Granny, so much.
You are too sweet.

01:03:13.452 --> 01:03:16.353

Thank you, Granny. Maybe something I
wouldn't have chosen for myself. Thank you.

01:03:28.133 --> 01:03:30.795
Well, I didn't choose it for you, baby.
I got it for Sherman.

01:03:30.869 --> 01:03:34.361

Now, that's what I call

01:04:59.491 --> 01:05:02.187
El Negro special.

01:05:02.260 --> 01:05:04.353
Mmm-mmm!

01:05:23.882 --> 01:05:26.544
Hey.

01:05:26.618 --> 01:05:28.552
Well, hello there,
stripper man.

01:05:28.620 --> 01:05:33.353
Now, you know, lordered the special, and
you supposed to be dressed as a fireman.

01:05:33.425 --> 01:05:37.054
Stripperman? Oh, stripper
Oh, yes, stripperman.

01:05:37.129 --> 01:05:39.529
Well, I, um
I decided not to do my fii reman dance tonight,

01:05:39.598 --> 01:05:42.533
because last time I did it, things got
so heated up, kind of scorched my suit.

01:05:42.601 --> 01:05:46.002
So I decided to do my cat burglar dance.
And I slip through the back door...

01:05:46.071 --> 01:05:48.335
and I'm kind of poking around,
'cause I'm a method stripper...

01:05:48.406 --> 01:05:50.931
and I want to get the right frame of mind so I can
give y'all some good stripping.

01:05:51.009 --> 01:05:55.946
You know, work it for you.
You know, you look just like Ken Norton in Mandingo.

01:05:56.014 --> 01:05:59.040
Oh, really? Oh, Ken Norton
Oh, Mandingo. Ken Norton. Really?

01:05:59.117 --> 01:06:02.484
I guess this is the closest I'm
gonna ever get to Ken Norton.

01:06:02.554 --> 01:06:06.064
Well, thank you so much.
Thank you. Thank you.

01:06:06.133 --> 01:06:08.658
I wonder if you could
give me a little private dance.

01:06:08.735 --> 01:06:11.135
Oh, okay. You want a private
You wanna slow down?

01:06:11.204 --> 01:06:13.399
Stop, stop, stop! I'm
gonna need some space here.

01:06:13.473 --> 01:06:16.033
You want a private dance.
Okay, I can do that.

01:06:16.109 --> 01:06:20.842
But first, um, I'm so thirsty. I got a craving for some
- for some red fruit punch.

01:06:20.914 --> 01:06:24.247
Red fruit punch? I ain't
seen none in the house, boy.

01:06:24.317 --> 01:06:26.683
But today I seen some out in the
Frigidaire, out in the garage.

01:06:26.753 --> 01:06:29.415
Oh, there may be some in the garage?
Well, after I quench my thirst,

01:06:29.489 --> 01:06:31.753
I'm gonna come give you a dance. Ow!

01:06:31.825 --> 01:06:34.988
I'll be moving like this. You like that,
don't you? Yeah, that's like Soul Train.

01:06:35.061 --> 01:06:37.996
That's la vida loca. Make this
face here like I'm tearing it up.

01:06:38.064 --> 01:06:41.659
Oh, good Lord. Oh, my
precious Lord. You like that?

01:06:41.735 --> 01:06:44.863
Don't move now. I ain't going nowhere.
I'll be right here for the Soul Train.

01:06:44.938 --> 01:06:50.342
I'll be right back.
For the Soul Train!

01:06:50.410 --> 01:06:52.378
I'll be right back.

01:06:54.247 --> 01:06:56.579
Oh, my goodness,
is there a fii re?

01:06:56.650 --> 01:07:00.245
Yes, ma'am, I'm afraid there
is. I don't smell no smoke.

01:07:02.956 --> 01:07:04.924
There's a fii re
in my pants...

01:07:04.991 --> 01:07:07.221
and it's getting
muy caliente!

01:07:07.294 --> 01:07:11.390
Oh, Lord, have mercy!
A strip- Oh, my!

01:07:13.099 --> 01:07:15.863
My mother must've
arranged this.

01:07:17.103 --> 01:07:19.571
Where are you? Oop-

01:07:19.639 --> 01:07:22.767
Oh, bingo! Bingo.

01:07:22.843 --> 01:07:25.812
Chunky Butt, thank you so much
for making this easy.

01:07:25.879 --> 01:07:27.904
I thought this was
gonna be diffiicult.

01:07:27.981 --> 01:07:30.541
Chunky Butt made this
a nice, easy task forme.

01:07:30.617 --> 01:07:32.881
Yes, yes, yes.

01:07:35.188 --> 01:07:38.783
Perfect. Now I gotta find
something to cut this with.

01:07:38.859 --> 01:07:40.793
Maybe a little
fertilizer or something.

01:07:40.861 --> 01:07:45.457
Oh, this is gonna
be perfect, Chunky Butt.

01:07:45.532 --> 01:07:50.367
I think this will help spruce up your presentation
quite a bit.

01:07:53.473 --> 01:07:55.304
Oh, Lord!

01:07:55.375 --> 01:08:00.078
I didn't know there was
gonna be a stripper.

01:08:01.348 --> 01:08:05.717
Mama! Mama!

01:08:16.595 --> 01:08:20.760
Love

Is a many
splendoredthing

01:08:28.008 --> 01:08:31.000
It's the April-rose

01:08:31.077 --> 01:08:34.171
That only grows

01:08:34.247 --> 01:08:38.809
In the early spring

01:08:39.886 --> 01:08:42.649
Love is nature's way

01:08:42.721 --> 01:08:45.885
Of giving

01:08:45.959 --> 01:08:51.488
A reason to be living

01:08:51.564 --> 01:08:54.158
The golden crown

01:08:54.234 --> 01:08:55.724
That makes a man

01:08:55.801 --> 01:08:58.965
A king

01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:04.167
Oh, we gonna have the whole
room smelling like ass.

01:09:04.243 --> 01:09:08.475
Shake it, shake. And it's
like I was never here.

01:09:08.548 --> 01:09:11.015
Oh! Oh!

01:09:11.084 --> 01:09:13.917
Hey! You scared me just now.

You're not supposed to be out here.
This must be your lucky night.

You're supposed to be in the house.
I'm fiittin' to teach you...

01:09:26.633 --> 01:09:29.193

Oh!
Oh! Oh! Oh!

01:09:42.582 --> 01:09:45.448
Oh, stripper man.

01:09:45.518 --> 01:09:48.247
Oh, I feel so vulnerable.

01:09:48.321 --> 01:09:51.586
Come on. Let's get it on right
now, right here, right now.

01:09:51.658 --> 01:09:54.593
Oh, stripper. Wait. Just calm
Relax a second.

01:09:54.661 --> 01:09:57.425
Now, listen. We gonna get
it on. But not out here.

01:09:57.497 --> 01:09:59.692
You don't wanna get it on out here,
do you, in this nasty, stink garage?

01:09:59.766 --> 01:10:02.735
Let's go in the house in a warm
bed where I can give you the shimmy.

01:10:02.802 --> 01:10:06.966
I'll meet you in your room. I
ain't falling for that trick.

01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:08.974
I'm gonna get that knot
out your back.

01:10:09.042 --> 01:10:12.773
You gonna have togive me
a little sugar right now, or I'll scream.

01:10:12.846 --> 01:10:15.838
No, no, don't scream.
Don't scream.

01:10:15.915 --> 01:10:19.373
No, no, no. Shh, shh.
Wait, wait, wait. I'll give you a little kiss.

01:10:19.452 --> 01:10:23.718
A little peck on the cheek. Meet you
up in the room. Ain't gonna hurt nobody.

01:10:23.790 --> 01:10:27.282
You're so cute. Come here.
I want a little sugar.

01:10:28.361 --> 01:10:31.922
Oh, God!

01:10:31.998 --> 01:10:34.398
Oh, Ken Norton!

01:10:53.086 --> 01:10:56.647
Folks, we want toget everybody
into the presentation,

01:10:56.723 --> 01:10:58.748
so please have
your press credentials ready.

01:11:13.373 --> 01:11:17.366
Well, if it isn't ol' Chunky Butt.
Buddy, what are you doing here?

01:11:17.444 --> 01:11:20.436
I just came down for your big
presentation. You're not nervous, are you?

01:11:20.513 --> 01:11:22.777
No, I ain't nervous. "No,
I ain't. " "No, I ain't. "

01:11:22.849 --> 01:11:25.647
That's interesting. Starting
to sound kind of ignorant.

01:11:25.718 --> 01:11:27.652
But don't worry.
If this professor thing don't work out,

01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:29.984
there's always room for another brother
down at the car wash.

01:11:30.056 --> 01:11:31.990
They could put a big
beach towel on your ass,

01:11:32.058 --> 01:11:33.992
and you can stand
in the doorway as the cars come out...

01:11:34.060 --> 01:11:35.994
and dry 'em
a side at a time.

01:11:36.062 --> 01:11:39.998
That's your future.
Buddy, I notice since the split-up...

01:11:40.066 --> 01:11:43.797
that, uh, I ain't really
I haven't really felt like myself.

01:11:43.870 --> 01:11:45.804
I was wondering if you've been
experiencing any changes.

01:11:45.872 --> 01:11:48.397
Not at all. I feel great. Never
felt better in my life.

01:11:48.475 --> 01:11:51.205
Business is really starting
to look up for me, Sherm.

01:11:52.712 --> 01:11:55.010
Hey, you betterrun!
Come here!

01:11:55.081 --> 01:11:57.413
Come here, pussy! You're a
pussy! That's what you are.

01:11:57.484 --> 01:12:00.578
I'll killyou! I'll killyou!
Come here, you pussy!

01:12:00.653 --> 01:12:02.587
Sherman coming on in a minute.

01:12:02.655 --> 01:12:05.818
Well, what channel's
Sherman gonna come on? Anybody know?

01:12:05.892 --> 01:12:09.328
Have some of these brownies. They're
still warm. Don't drop 'em on my floor now.

01:12:09.395 --> 01:12:12.523
All right, everbody. Sherman getting ready
to come on TV now. Everbody gather around.

01:12:12.599 --> 01:12:14.897
You know,
fame is gonna pass.

01:12:14.968 --> 01:12:16.902
And the only thing that's
permanent is family.

01:12:16.970 --> 01:12:19.803
Ain't that right, Daddy?
Oh, shit! Get your ass out that chair!

01:12:19.873 --> 01:12:22.808
How many times, Ernest, I gotta tell
you to stay out my damn chair? Aw, man.

01:12:22.876 --> 01:12:25.811
You work on them cars all day gonna put the
grease all in my chair, smear the grease there.

01:12:25.879 --> 01:12:28.609
Gotta sit on this grease. My gray pants
still got grease all over 'em 'cause ofyou.

01:12:28.681 --> 01:12:30.945
You happy? You got your chair. Enjoy.
Stay out my damn chair.

01:12:31.017 --> 01:12:35.283
Ernest, will you please tell your
father to be quiet? Sherman's coming on.

01:12:35.355 --> 01:12:37.516
What channel Sherman come on?
Tell me what she just said,

01:12:37.590 --> 01:12:40.286
I'll come over there and whup your ass.

01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:43.090
That's the channel.
Watch the damn TV.

01:12:43.163 --> 01:12:46.223
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen
for coming out. My name is Professor Sherman Klump.

01:12:46.299 --> 01:12:49.530
I'm a professor here
at Wellman College.

01:12:49.602 --> 01:12:52.093
Ooh!
Look at him.

01:12:52.172 --> 01:12:55.107
Joe College.
Look how dashing he look. He look just like Billy Dee.

01:12:55.175 --> 01:12:58.941
Boy look handsome.
Billy Dee! Billy Dee! Billy Dee! Billy Dee!

01:12:59.012 --> 01:13:01.776
Billy Dee Klump.
As you all know,

01:13:01.848 --> 01:13:05.716
Ponce de Leon searched his entire life
for the Fountain ofYouth.

01:13:05.785 --> 01:13:08.754
And today we will
complete his journey.

01:13:08.821 --> 01:13:12.587
So, uh, ladies and gentlemen,
I'dlike to present to you all,

01:13:12.659 --> 01:13:17.562
uh, the Wellman College
youth formula.

01:13:17.630 --> 01:13:20.224
Maybe I need to take some ofthat.
It don't cure ugly.

01:13:20.300 --> 01:13:22.768
Does Clesius
know I'm strapped?

01:13:22.835 --> 01:13:25.565
Well, come on. Shoot. Come on. Shoot.
I'm strapped, nigga.

01:13:25.638 --> 01:13:27.469
Tell him. I'm strapped.
And ifyou miss, I'm gonna finish you off.

01:13:27.540 --> 01:13:30.304
If you don't have anything nice
to say, don't say nothing at all.

01:13:30.376 --> 01:13:33.345
Well, she messin' with me.
Stop the violence. Stop the violence.

01:13:33.413 --> 01:13:36.678
And don't say nothing.
I'm tring to watch Sherman.

01:13:36.749 --> 01:13:38.683
Okay, cool, cool.

01:13:40.353 --> 01:13:42.514
Boy, would I like to throw
some hot grease on you.

01:13:45.510 --> 01:13:49.037
This is Molly. Molly is a
one-year-old, and Petey is four.

01:13:49.113 --> 01:13:53.641
Petey is our candidate for
genetic "transmografiication. "

01:13:55.620 --> 01:13:59.386
Petey here
Petey is ourcandidate forgenetic "transmofilectesy. "

01:13:59.457 --> 01:14:02.085
Genetic "transgromanation. "

01:14:02.159 --> 01:14:04.787
The "youthification-"
That ain't a word.

01:14:04.862 --> 01:14:06.796
Howcome Uncle Sherman's
talking funny?

01:14:06.864 --> 01:14:10.300
He's starting to sound like you, Dad.
He don't sound right, do he?

01:14:10.368 --> 01:14:13.064
What do you mean, "sound like me"? What's that?
Sherman up in a ivor tower...

01:14:13.137 --> 01:14:15.071
just 'cause
he went to college.

01:14:15.139 --> 01:14:18.267
I could've gone to college
if I took that damn...

01:14:18.342 --> 01:14:21.106
elastic "appitude" test.

01:14:21.178 --> 01:14:23.772
Hey, shut up.
What the hell's wrong with Sherman?

01:14:23.848 --> 01:14:27.807
You be breaking me down
in front of my seed on the regular.

01:14:27.885 --> 01:14:31.082
The reason we, uh- he-
We gonna make him young.

01:14:31.155 --> 01:14:34.921
So I say, um,
let's get it on!

01:14:38.496 --> 01:14:41.397
I'm gonna just give
a drop ofthis to Petey.

01:14:41.465 --> 01:14:43.865
We watch and see
what happens.

01:14:58.716 --> 01:15:01.048
Isaac, you watching that?
Hey, that ain't right.

01:15:02.687 --> 01:15:06.885
Hamsters will be hamsters, huh?
Oh!

01:15:30.147 --> 01:15:32.377
What in blazes- -
Oh! - Look at that!

01:15:32.450 --> 01:15:35.146
That's cool. That's real cool.
Look at that!

01:15:35.219 --> 01:15:36.846
Petey!
Down, boy!

01:15:48.599 --> 01:15:52.262
Petey!
Shoot him! Shoot him!

01:16:30.508 --> 01:16:33.705
No, no. No. Please,
I'm not that kindof-

01:16:33.778 --> 01:16:35.643
Guy

01:16:38.049 --> 01:16:41.041
Oh, my God. I have to turn
the channel. I don't want my babyseeing that.

01:16:41.118 --> 01:16:43.450
That man ain't never gonna be right again.
Oh!

01:16:43.521 --> 01:16:46.319
Somebody need to take Isaac's pressure.
Oh, what's wrong with this?

01:16:46.390 --> 01:16:48.551
Something like that will ruin a man.
Coverthe baby's eyes.

01:16:48.626 --> 01:16:51.254
That's too much excitement for my baby.
Turn the channel.

01:16:51.328 --> 01:16:54.764
- I can't even turn. - That's
nasty. - That's what that is.

01:16:54.832 --> 01:16:57.460
Turn the baby's eyes.
And he don't need to know what it is, Mama.

01:16:57.535 --> 01:17:00.402
Now, was that
supposed to happen?

01:17:02.773 --> 01:17:06.072
It's the lovely Miss Guilford.
Mr. Love.

01:17:06.143 --> 01:17:08.338
What a wonderful day
we're having, huh?

01:17:08.412 --> 01:17:10.346
Why am I not surprised
to see you here?

01:17:10.414 --> 01:17:13.042
Well, I figured since it turns out that
Professor Klump ain't your man after all,

01:17:13.117 --> 01:17:15.051
you might wanna talk
a deal.

01:17:17.655 --> 01:17:21.421
All right. Have your formula
ready for presentation on Friday.

01:17:21.492 --> 01:17:23.426
Friday it is.

01:17:23.494 --> 01:17:25.519
See you Friday. Lovely dress. Mm-hmm.

01:17:25.596 --> 01:17:27.530
I'll wear
something sharp.

01:17:35.606 --> 01:17:37.904
Oh, Dean. I'm just tring to figure out
what went wrong here.

01:17:37.975 --> 01:17:41.376
I just don't understand. It must've been
some sort of contaminant or something.

01:17:41.445 --> 01:17:45.506
The deal with Phleer is off. I
just spoke to Leanne Guilford.

01:17:45.583 --> 01:17:47.517
But that
doesn't botherme.

01:17:47.585 --> 01:17:50.918
After all,
what's $150 million?

01:17:50.988 --> 01:17:54.981
Oh! Dean Richmond,
I am so sorry.

01:17:55.059 --> 01:17:58.290
I'm really tring to get to the bottom of this, because
this was not supposed to happen.

01:17:58.362 --> 01:18:00.353
No, that's not
what bothers me.

01:18:00.431 --> 01:18:02.524
Deals will come
and deals will go.

01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:05.569
Wellman...
will always be Wellman.

01:18:05.636 --> 01:18:08.104
But I'll tell you
what does bother me.

01:18:08.172 --> 01:18:11.539
On the way over here, a cute
little boy pointed at me and said,

01:18:11.609 --> 01:18:15.773
"Oh, look, Mommy, there
goes the hamster's bitch!"

01:18:25.689 --> 01:18:28.886
Uh-
Dean, whatever it's worth,

01:18:28.959 --> 01:18:33.089
Petey is back to normal and
feelingjust fine. Oh, yeah?

01:18:33.164 --> 01:18:36.156
Do you think he'll call?

01:18:36.233 --> 01:18:40.693
Dean, I just want to tell you, I'm
I'm sorry. Stop... speaking!

01:18:40.771 --> 01:18:45.174
I just want to go on record as saying that-

01:18:45.242 --> 01:18:49.372
Shh, shh, shh.
Shh, shh, shh.

01:18:50.981 --> 01:18:55.247
I've been looking forward to saying
something to you for 12 years.

01:18:55.319 --> 01:18:58.413
And here it is.

01:18:58.489 --> 01:19:02.186
You're fat!

01:19:05.763 --> 01:19:10.257
And dumb.

01:19:12.336 --> 01:19:14.304
And fired.

01:19:33.057 --> 01:19:34.991
Sherman.

01:19:35.059 --> 01:19:37.425
It's not your fault.

01:19:37.494 --> 01:19:40.054
I ain't never-

01:19:40.130 --> 01:19:42.496
I'm never gonna be the same again, am I?

01:19:42.566 --> 01:19:44.659
I'm afraid not.

01:19:51.041 --> 01:19:55.205
Since you've separated
brain cells have been damaged.

01:19:55.279 --> 01:19:58.806
your speech and memory-

01:19:58.883 --> 01:20:01.351
I know.
I'll be a total idiot.

01:20:03.754 --> 01:20:06.416
Don't you think it's
time you told Denise?

01:20:06.490 --> 01:20:09.220
Oh, no, Jason.
I can't do that.

01:20:09.293 --> 01:20:11.727
How can I tell her
I'm losing the very thing...

01:20:11.795 --> 01:20:14.423
that made her fall in love
with me in the first place?

01:20:17.067 --> 01:20:19.001
Mm-mmm.

01:20:38.222 --> 01:20:41.191
Hi.
Sherman, what are you doing here?

01:20:43.994 --> 01:20:48.021
How you doing?
Your mama told me I might be able to find you here.

01:20:48.098 --> 01:20:51.033
I've been looking all over the place for
you. I've been leaving messages everwhere.

01:20:51.101 --> 01:20:55.003
I went by your place. Yeah,
well, I had a lot on my mind.

01:20:55.072 --> 01:20:58.041
You know, I walk around,
going around, getting time to think.

01:20:58.108 --> 01:21:00.079
I wonder if I can talk
to you about something.

01:21:00.213 --> 01:21:02.181
Look, I know you're upset
about what happened.

01:21:02.248 --> 01:21:04.614
But we can get right back
to work with the youth formula,

01:21:04.684 --> 01:21:07.619
and I think the problem-
No, not science.

01:21:07.687 --> 01:21:11.214
Denise, I'm not
This isn't about science. We can start completely over.

01:21:11.290 --> 01:21:14.088
We can find another university.
After the wedding, we can even-

01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:17.027
That's what I'm talking
about- the wedding.

01:21:17.096 --> 01:21:20.532
Denise, I don't think
there's going to be a wedding.

01:21:20.600 --> 01:21:22.693
Well, not-
not right away anyway.

01:21:22.768 --> 01:21:25.896
I mean, my head's just kind
of messed up right now,

01:21:25.972 --> 01:21:28.270
and I don't think it'd be fair to you.

01:21:28.341 --> 01:21:30.332
What?

01:21:30.409 --> 01:21:32.877
I made a mistake.

01:21:32.945 --> 01:21:36.472
And I have to work that mistake out.
I have to live with that.

01:21:36.549 --> 01:21:40.576
Me, not you. See, you're so pretty,
and you're so smart.

01:21:40.653 --> 01:21:42.587
You just got your whole life
ahead of you.

01:21:42.655 --> 01:21:45.818
I just don't want to mess things up
foryou. I'm-

01:21:45.891 --> 01:21:47.825
I'm sorry, Denise.

01:21:53.966 --> 01:21:55.991
I think
I'd better get going.

01:22:28.567 --> 01:22:30.933
You allright?

01:22:31.003 --> 01:22:33.471
Oh, I just don't
understand, Clesius.

01:22:33.539 --> 01:22:35.973
And he won't tell me why.

01:22:36.042 --> 01:22:40.240
Anna, listen. Sometimes a man
do some crazy things, you know?

01:22:40.313 --> 01:22:42.076
Oh!

01:22:42.148 --> 01:22:45.276
Not that he's tring to hurt nobody. He's
not tring to tell you he don't love you.

01:22:45.351 --> 01:22:47.512
It's just-

01:22:47.586 --> 01:22:50.714
Sometimes you get kind of confused,
you know?

01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:56.555
You hear
what I'm saying?

01:22:57.963 --> 01:23:01.421
Yes, Clesius,
I hear what you're saying.

01:23:01.500 --> 01:23:04.162
I'll talk to the boy.

01:23:04.236 --> 01:23:06.227
Everthing
was so fabulous.

01:23:06.305 --> 01:23:10.002
You cut out that cring
now. It's all right.

01:23:10.076 --> 01:23:14.274
Stop all that crying.
Go clean your nose up.

01:23:14.347 --> 01:23:17.783
Go wash your hands. Snot all over
the place looking nasty as hell.

01:23:17.850 --> 01:23:21.911
What's this on me? Goddamn, look what you
put on me, Anna. What's this on me for?

01:23:30.463 --> 01:23:32.397
Yeah, you know
something, Sherman?

01:23:32.465 --> 01:23:35.025
The very first building I ever
worked on was on this site right here.

01:23:35.101 --> 01:23:38.935
Yep. Isn't that
something? It was a baker.

01:23:39.004 --> 01:23:41.495
Yeah.
Tore it down two years ago.

01:23:41.574 --> 01:23:43.872
Thirty-fiive years later,
I wind up working on the thing,

01:23:43.943 --> 01:23:46.377
building it up all over again;
ain't that something?

01:23:46.445 --> 01:23:50.347
I expected the building
I worked on was permanent.

01:23:50.416 --> 01:23:52.816
But I was wrong,
'cause it ain't.

01:23:52.885 --> 01:23:55.513
That's not permanent.
You know what's permanent, Sherman?

01:23:55.588 --> 01:23:58.489
You know what's permanent?
I'm gonna tell you.

01:23:58.557 --> 01:24:01.685
What me and your mama got.
That's permanent.

01:24:01.761 --> 01:24:04.662
That ain't going no place.
You know what I mean?

01:24:04.730 --> 01:24:07.130
If you get you a woman that really,
really loves you,

01:24:07.199 --> 01:24:09.394
you've got to hold on
to that, Sherman.

01:24:12.138 --> 01:24:16.837
Yeah, that's true, Daddy.
Yeah, I knows I sure do love Denise.

01:24:16.909 --> 01:24:19.434
Well, then y'all gotta
get back together then.

01:24:21.347 --> 01:24:26.410
Get back together?
Daddy, that's it. Yeah.

01:24:26.485 --> 01:24:30.854
Get back together. If we get back
together, that'll make everthing okay.

01:24:30.923 --> 01:24:33.824
Dynamite. Go call the girl.
Say what? Not Denise. Buddy.

01:24:33.893 --> 01:24:37.488
Me and Buddy get back together,
that'll make everthing fine between me and Denise.

01:24:37.563 --> 01:24:40.259
Hey, you just took
the wrong off-ramp.

01:24:40.332 --> 01:24:44.496
I can use the youth formula. I'll feed
it to Buddy. It'll make him so young.

01:24:44.570 --> 01:24:48.097
I'll turn him back into Goop. And I ingest
I eat it! I eat it! Huh?

01:24:48.174 --> 01:24:50.108
That's it.
Daddy, that'll work.

01:24:50.176 --> 01:24:52.110
I wouldn't have even
thought about that.

01:24:52.178 --> 01:24:54.203
This is fantastic!
What are you gonna eat?

01:24:54.280 --> 01:24:56.680
Sherman! Damn!

01:25:23.142 --> 01:25:25.542
Hello, Sherman.
I heard you were here.

01:25:25.611 --> 01:25:29.308
Give me a minute, Dean, and I'll
be on my way. Trespass all you like.

01:25:29.381 --> 01:25:33.317
It goes so well in court with grand theft.
I beg your pardon.

01:25:33.385 --> 01:25:36.786
You're tring to sell the youth formula
under a different identity.

01:25:36.856 --> 01:25:39.416
Who do you think you are? Dean,
you just don't understand, really.

01:25:39.492 --> 01:25:42.655
That's always possible. Then help
me out if you don't mind. Explain it.

01:25:42.728 --> 01:25:44.821
Why is Buddy Love
meeting with Phleer?

01:25:44.897 --> 01:25:48.162
Oh, my goodness. I gotta
hurry up. Not so fast, pal.

01:25:48.234 --> 01:25:50.759
I'm not letting you out of my sight
until both our names are on that contract.

01:25:50.836 --> 01:25:54.397
I'm going to be stuck on you
like a giant hamster on my a-

01:25:56.108 --> 01:25:59.805
Where you go, I go. I have no time to stand
here and argue with you.

01:25:59.879 --> 01:26:02.439
Ifyou wanna come along,
I'll explain it to you on the way.

01:26:02.515 --> 01:26:05.916
Ladies and gentlemen and
distinguished guests, it is showtime.

01:26:05.985 --> 01:26:07.919
Now I'd like to present
to you exhibit "A."

01:26:07.987 --> 01:26:10.114
His name is Zeke,
and it is ver clear...

01:26:10.189 --> 01:26:13.590
that Zeke has been getting his ass whipped
by Father Time for many, many years.

01:26:58.637 --> 01:27:00.628
Oh, my God, Sherman.

01:27:07.379 --> 01:27:10.473
Sherman! Sherman!
Sherman!

01:27:10.549 --> 01:27:13.074
Hey, hey, hey, Denise.
Thank God.

01:27:13.152 --> 01:27:16.144
What the hell's going on?
Papa Klump, have you seen Sherman?

01:27:16.221 --> 01:27:18.155
He's in trouble.
Oh, tell me about it.

01:27:18.223 --> 01:27:21.249
First the boy acting crazy and called off the
wedding. Then he talking about eating some guy.

01:27:21.327 --> 01:27:24.057
I don't know if it's something I need
to talk to the boy about.

01:27:24.129 --> 01:27:27.155
Wait. Eating somebody?
Yeah, he said he's gonna eat some man.

01:27:27.232 --> 01:27:29.427
Of course. Buddy.

01:27:29.501 --> 01:27:31.765
Yeah, that's the guy.
What's going on between the three of y'all?

01:27:31.837 --> 01:27:35.705
What's this, a kind of menage a trois?
I know where Sherman is.

01:27:35.808 --> 01:27:39.710
Ladies and gentlemen, if Zeke dropped dead right now,
who would care?

01:27:39.778 --> 01:27:42.406
I would.
My point exactly.

01:27:42.481 --> 01:27:45.177
Exactly. That no person,
no matter who they are,

01:27:45.250 --> 01:27:48.481
no matter how hopelessly
disgusting their case may be,

01:27:48.554 --> 01:27:50.920
should be left
without a second chance.

01:27:50.990 --> 01:27:54.926
And that is why I would like
to introduce... New You,

01:27:54.994 --> 01:27:57.019
a fully copyrighted product
being offered to you...

01:27:57.096 --> 01:27:58.893
by the good people
of Love Enterprises.

01:27:58.964 --> 01:28:01.489
Now, if you'd be so kind,
Zeke, would you drink this up, please?

01:28:01.567 --> 01:28:03.789
It's kind
of like Mogen David, but fruitier.

01:28:03.923 --> 01:28:06.483
Wait! I'm sorry to interrupt,
ladies and gentlemen!

01:28:06.558 --> 01:28:11.586
But I cannot go on living unless
I have this man inside me right now.

01:28:11.664 --> 01:28:14.098
Steady, sailor.
What the hell is going on here?

01:28:14.166 --> 01:28:17.260
Well, if it isn't Professor
Sherman Klump, the inventor of Jumbo the Horny Hamster.

01:28:17.336 --> 01:28:21.534
Please!
Buddy, I am sick and I am tired...

01:28:21.607 --> 01:28:24.735
of your s-h-
"I. "

01:28:24.810 --> 01:28:27.608
Thank you. T-E.

01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:30.240
My shite? Oh, really?
Well, what you gonna do about it, Shamu?

01:28:30.316 --> 01:28:33.683
Tell you what I'm gonna do.
I don't have no time to play no games with your ass.

01:28:33.752 --> 01:28:37.085
You got time to play a little catch, don't you?
Oh, you bastard.

01:28:42.995 --> 01:28:45.429
Buddy.

01:28:45.497 --> 01:28:49.024
Aw!

01:28:49.101 --> 01:28:52.468
Buddy, Buddy. Buddy.

01:28:52.538 --> 01:28:54.972
Get it, Buddy. Buddy!

01:28:55.040 --> 01:28:57.975
Na, na, na, na.
Hey, Buddy. Fetch.

01:29:14.827 --> 01:29:17.728
Aach!

01:29:17.796 --> 01:29:19.787
What the hell is that?

01:29:19.865 --> 01:29:22.129
Who's dumb now?

01:29:26.138 --> 01:29:28.606
Oh, Sherman. Oh, you
sneaky son of a bitch.

01:29:28.674 --> 01:29:31.268
Oh, Sherman!

01:29:32.211 --> 01:29:34.270
Oh, no!

01:29:36.181 --> 01:29:40.208
Oh, shit! Uh- ah- ah-
Everbody calm down.

01:29:40.285 --> 01:29:42.981
This is a part of the demonstration.
Just calm- Relax.

01:29:43.055 --> 01:29:45.580
Everything's undercontrol.
What the hell are you looking at?

01:29:45.657 --> 01:29:48.785
This is an impressive package for a toddler.
All right, Mr. Toddler.

01:29:48.861 --> 01:29:52.422
Nothing to see here, folks.
This mutant is about to dissolve into liquid,

01:29:52.498 --> 01:29:54.864
and then the fat man is going
to suck him through a straw.

01:29:54.933 --> 01:29:58.334
Sorry, Buddy.
I just want my life back.

01:29:58.404 --> 01:30:01.271
You don't owe him any explan- What?
Come here.

01:30:01.340 --> 01:30:04.434
Oh, you rotten
son of a- Oh!

01:30:04.510 --> 01:30:07.172
I'm hit! I'm hit!
Forget it, fat ass.

01:30:07.246 --> 01:30:11.342
I ain't going back
inside of you. Mmm. Got milk?

01:30:13.886 --> 01:30:16.047
Thank you, baby.

01:30:18.057 --> 01:30:20.855
He's getting away.

01:30:20.926 --> 01:30:26.228
Dean, I want that formula. Bring me the man who made it.
I'm ready to make a deal.

01:30:26.298 --> 01:30:28.232
Hmm? Right.

01:30:30.302 --> 01:30:33.863
I'm naked! I'm naked! I'm
naked! I'm naked! I'm naked!

01:30:38.377 --> 01:30:41.972
There he is.
What the hell is happening?

01:30:50.422 --> 01:30:53.880
What the hell was that? Buddy.

01:30:56.595 --> 01:30:58.529
All right, that's it. Slow
the car down! Slow down!

01:30:58.597 --> 01:31:00.531
We can't help Sherman
wrapped around no light pole.

01:31:00.599 --> 01:31:03.090
We've got to get to him. He and
Buddy have to be combined immediately.

01:31:05.904 --> 01:31:08.338
Where's the little snot now?

01:31:08.407 --> 01:31:11.103
What the hell are you looking at?
Come on.

01:31:11.176 --> 01:31:13.406
What? What?

01:31:15.280 --> 01:31:17.578
Don't feel right. Starting
to feel a little light-headed.

01:31:17.649 --> 01:31:20.948
If you quit now, you're gonna be
empty-headed. Come on, Klump. Let's get him.

01:31:21.019 --> 01:31:24.011
Get a hold of this, chubby.

01:31:30.295 --> 01:31:32.957
Whoo!
You got a big ass!

01:31:35.367 --> 01:31:38.700
What?
Follow that ass.

01:31:41.073 --> 01:31:43.200
Aw, hell.
Now, what's all of this?

01:31:43.275 --> 01:31:45.800
Move out the way, damn it!
Wait a minute. I think I see him.

01:31:51.450 --> 01:31:54.044
Goddamn.

01:31:55.621 --> 01:31:58.089
Oh, no. Don't even think about it.
Don't you do it.

01:31:58.157 --> 01:32:00.216
Oh, you're doing it.

01:32:03.962 --> 01:32:06.795
Ow!
Stop!

01:32:14.406 --> 01:32:16.897
All right, tubby.

01:32:16.975 --> 01:32:21.469
Let's see how long
you last without me.

01:32:27.352 --> 01:32:30.412
What? What?
That's it?

01:32:30.489 --> 01:32:33.458
He's gone?
Ah, I-I- da-da-

01:32:33.525 --> 01:32:36.494
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.
Oh, that's marvelous.

01:32:41.066 --> 01:32:44.263
The deal is dead,
you know that?

01:32:44.336 --> 01:32:47.499
I've been calling you a moron for years.
Now you're finally-

01:32:52.444 --> 01:32:55.436
I'll just get a cab.

01:33:05.976 --> 01:33:10.072
Ohhh, Sherman!
I raised a genius.

01:33:10.147 --> 01:33:12.479
No one isperfect. - I want
to beperfect forher. - Perfect?

01:33:12.549 --> 01:33:15.643
About time you told Denise? - I
checked the file. - There's no future.

01:33:15.719 --> 01:33:20.122
You will never learn to control him
till you accept the fact he is apart of you.

01:33:33.604 --> 01:33:36.266
Sherman.

01:33:37.408 --> 01:33:39.137
You okay?

01:33:45.916 --> 01:33:50.512
Gone
he's all gone. Buddy? He evaporated?

01:33:50.587 --> 01:33:54.353
Gone. And me no smart.
Never. No more.

01:33:54.425 --> 01:33:57.360
Sherman, that's okay.
I mean, we'll figure something out.

01:33:57.428 --> 01:34:00.192
There has to be something
that we can do.

01:34:00.264 --> 01:34:02.698
I want to say
I'm- I'm sorry.

01:34:04.268 --> 01:34:07.965
I never
I didn't want to hurt you. You understand?

01:34:08.038 --> 01:34:12.236
I thought that if you knew
that Buddy was a part of me,

01:34:12.309 --> 01:34:14.800
I thought that you
wouldn't have me then.

01:34:14.878 --> 01:34:17.142
Sherman.
Now, hear me.

01:34:17.214 --> 01:34:19.148
Hear me out now.

01:34:20.717 --> 01:34:23.083
I should've had
more faith in you.

01:34:24.488 --> 01:34:26.513
Should've had
more faith in myself.

01:34:26.590 --> 01:34:29.218
But I-
Sherman.

01:34:29.293 --> 01:34:33.320
Sherman, what's wrong?
Sherman?

01:34:33.397 --> 01:34:35.865
Can't you hear, son?
Sherman, look at me.

01:34:35.933 --> 01:34:38.265
Who am I?

01:34:44.708 --> 01:34:47.268
Pretty lady.
Oh, honey.

01:34:47.344 --> 01:34:49.278
Oh, that's nice.

01:34:49.346 --> 01:34:54.010
It's gonna be okay.
Nice.

01:34:54.084 --> 01:34:56.075
I'll take care of you.

01:34:56.153 --> 01:34:58.747
Oh! Come on.
Let's get the boy home.

01:34:59.990 --> 01:35:01.924
Nice lady.

01:35:09.133 --> 01:35:11.931
Come on. Let'sget him home. Come on.

01:35:12.002 --> 01:35:13.469
Go home now.

01:35:13.537 --> 01:35:15.471
Thank you.

01:35:21.044 --> 01:35:24.036
Oh, look at the-
the pretty water.

01:35:27.050 --> 01:35:29.450
Oh, my God.
It's Buddy.

01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:32.921
His DNA burst into water molecules. Sherman, quick.
What the hell?

01:35:32.990 --> 01:35:35.083
Drink this.
No. Dirty water.

01:35:35.159 --> 01:35:38.151
No. Come on, honey. You
have to drink this. Please.

01:35:39.563 --> 01:35:42.293
Drink dirty water. Look
at me. What's my name?

01:35:45.235 --> 01:35:48.830
Denise. You're Denise.
Oh, yes. Drink some more.

01:35:48.906 --> 01:35:50.737
Denise. Come on.
Drink some more.

01:35:50.807 --> 01:35:54.072
What's two times two?
Two times two is four.

01:35:54.144 --> 01:35:57.238
Four times four? Four times four is fiif
sixteen.

01:35:57.314 --> 01:36:00.249
Sherman, yes. Drink some
more before Buddy disperses.

01:36:00.317 --> 01:36:03.309
Come on, boy.

01:36:04.688 --> 01:36:06.849
What's your mama
middle name?

01:36:06.924 --> 01:36:10.018
Oh, hell, no.
That ain't it.

01:36:10.093 --> 01:36:12.618
Get a lot now.
Get a lot.

01:36:12.696 --> 01:36:13.958
That's enough.

01:36:14.031 --> 01:36:17.125
Pearl. He said Pearl! He said Pearl!

01:36:17.201 --> 01:36:20.034
Anna Pearl. Sherman, what's
the square root of 2,000,602?

01:36:20.103 --> 01:36:23.368
That's a hard one.
Four thousand,

01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:26.500
414.426...

01:36:26.577 --> 01:36:29.512
3855.
Oh, yes!

01:36:31.515 --> 01:36:33.813
Oh, Sherman, yes!

01:36:55.038 --> 01:36:58.701
Oh, fabulous! Oh!

01:36:58.775 --> 01:37:02.006
Dynamite! Dynamite!
That's so lovely.

01:37:02.079 --> 01:37:07.574
This go out to the new
Mr. and Ms. Sherman Klump.

01:37:07.651 --> 01:37:10.119
Hear! Hear!
Come on, ya'll. Take it down.

01:37:10.187 --> 01:37:13.020

In a million

01:37:17.227 --> 01:37:20.219
Chance

01:37:20.297 --> 01:37:23.755
Of a lifetime
That sounds good.

01:37:23.834 --> 01:37:25.267

01:37:25.335 --> 01:37:28.771
Whoo! Ernie, this

Yes, indeed.

And I am finally

01:37:36.613 --> 01:37:39.912
Sherman Klump in charge.

01:37:39.983 --> 01:37:43.714
You know I saved Sherman's life.
Clesius Klump, stop all that bragging.

01:37:43.787 --> 01:37:47.723
Come on. Dance with me. Excuse us.
I'll get right back at ya.

Okay, you guys,

You know what this means,
don't you?

01:38:00.671 --> 01:38:03.902
Piece of happiness
to call my own.

01:38:05.575 --> 01:38:10.239
And life's worth
living again

01:38:10.314 --> 01:38:14.375
Anna Pearl, you are looking
foxy fii ne tonight. Oh!

01:38:15.852 --> 01:38:18.412
Yeah, you got me feeling like I'm
20 years old again.

Oh, Cle- Ooh!

Ooh, Clesius,

Mm-hmm.

Hercules, Hercules,
Hercules, Hercules!

01:38:32.869 --> 01:38:34.996
One in a million

01:38:35.072 --> 01:38:37.666
Million
Make that a billion

01:38:37.741 --> 01:38:40.904
No, a trillion
Oh, a zillion

01:38:40.977 --> 01:38:44.980
You, you
