        Of his crying.

        Oh, good news.
        She's here.

02:28.849 --> 02:31.650
    Apparently joe sent emma
    and some guy to meet her,

02:31.652 --> 02:33.652
    But we intervened.

02:33.654 --> 02:34.753
            If you hurt her--

        Save your breath.

        the next part.

        Here's what you
        need to do.

02:37.858 --> 02:41.026
    I want you to bring
    joe carroll to me alive.

02:41.028 --> 02:42.661
        You do that,
        and you get

What will it be?

02:48.702 --> 02:50.903
            I can't do it, luke.
            It's impossible.

    You're the big, bad
        ryan hardy.

02:52.706 --> 02:54.573
    You can do anything.

02:54.575 --> 02:56.208
    Claire's counting on it.

02:56.210 --> 02:57.276
    Because if you don't,

02:57.278 --> 02:58.710
    I'm gonna cut off her face

02:58.712 --> 03:00.412

to find him.

    Just kill him already.

            Just do it.

            to claire.

    Bring me joe carroll.

03:09.089 --> 03:10.622
            Does he have
            to be alive?

03:10.624 --> 03:14.059
        Yes, ryan. Alive.
        Do not kill him.

03:14.061 --> 03:15.060

    get in there.

        for his signal

04:52.126 --> 04:53.525

        I'm not sure
        about anything.

08:38.184 --> 08:39.851
            Ok. Give me
            your phone.
            Here's a disposable.

08:39.852 --> 08:41.086
            I programmed
            the number in there.

08:41.087 --> 08:43.587
            We'll be using
            one, too.

08:49.896 --> 08:51.563
            Get in.

08:51.864 --> 08:53.765
    Give me your cuffs.

08:57.470 --> 08:59.137
    Man on radio:
    Hostages are secure.

08:59.139 --> 09:02.474
            All right.
            Turn on the lights.

09:02.476 --> 09:04.543
        This is the fbi!
        Please stay calm.

09:04.545 --> 09:08.413
We will take you out of here
    as soon as possible.

09:08.415 --> 09:11.950
    Please stay where you are.

09:11.952 --> 09:13.885
        Where's ryan?

09:13.887 --> 09:15.253
        Where's weston?

09:15.255 --> 09:16.121
    Where's joe carroll?

09:16.123 --> 09:18.790
            Clarke is figuring
            this out now.
            You have to go.

09:18.792 --> 09:20.225
Is this strictly
necessary, ryan?

09:20.227 --> 09:22.627
    Absolutely.

09:22.629 --> 09:24.763
Luke texted me
the address.
It's on my phone.

09:24.765 --> 09:26.798
        We'll follow you
        as soon as we can
        get out of here

09:26.800 --> 09:29.301
    Without being spotted.

09:29.303 --> 09:32.270
            I love you.

09:32.272 --> 09:34.105
I love you.

09:34.107 --> 09:35.907
                Let's go.

09:57.930 --> 10:01.866
I suppose the radio is
out of the question, is it?

10:03.869 --> 10:06.104
You could at least
talk to me.

10:06.106 --> 10:08.840
It's rather lonely
back here.

10:12.111 --> 10:15.547
        How'd you survive
        8 years on death row,

10:15.549 --> 10:17.215
        Confined to a cell
        with no audience,

10:17.217 --> 10:18.683
        No one to sing
        or dance for?

10:18.685 --> 10:20.685
Yeah, it was hideous,
pure hell.

10:20.687 --> 10:25.190
Granted, a prison cell
is a great motivator,

10:25.192 --> 10:26.358
But I've already
escaped twice.

10:26.360 --> 10:29.995
I'm not entirely convinced
I've got a third one in me.

10:29.997 --> 10:33.064
        Your legacy ends today.

10:33.066 --> 10:35.200
All I ever wanted was

10:35.202 --> 10:38.703
For my name
to live forever.

10:38.705 --> 10:41.840
I think I've probably...

10:41.842 --> 10:44.576
Accomplished that.

10:48.414 --> 10:52.150
I want you to know
something, that--

10:52.152 --> 10:54.352
Uh, that when I die,

10:54.354 --> 11:00.191
I hope that you and claire
can find a way to be happy.

11:00.193 --> 11:02.761
            Is that what
            you want, joe?

11:02.763 --> 11:05.096
I've come round
to it actually.

11:05.098 --> 11:09.668
I do understand
why she loved you.

11:09.670 --> 11:10.902
Inverted morals aside,

11:10.904 --> 11:12.604
You and I are
very much cut

11:12.606 --> 11:14.939
From the same cloth.

11:14.941 --> 11:19.678
We're basically
the same person.

11:30.389 --> 11:33.858
        I disabled the gps.
        The fbi won't be
        able to track us.

11:33.860 --> 11:35.360
Ryan should be out
of the city by now.

11:35.362 --> 11:36.695
        We'll have to clear
        the checkpoints,

11:36.697 --> 11:38.229
        But we shouldn't be
        that far behind.

11:38.231 --> 11:39.698
Hey. Are you ok?

11:39.700 --> 11:42.267
Are you sure
you're up for this?

11:42.269 --> 11:43.301
            Yeah.

11:43.303 --> 11:45.270
Because you almost died.

11:45.272 --> 11:47.572
            I'm ok.

11:49.041 --> 11:50.375
            We should
            get moving.

11:50.377 --> 11:52.610
            Clarke's gonna be
            looking for us.

12:19.772 --> 12:22.307
        Who lives here?

12:22.309 --> 12:23.241
We do.

12:23.243 --> 12:25.243
            Sometimes.

12:25.245 --> 12:27.679
            Mother gave it
            to us so we had
            a playground.

12:27.681 --> 12:29.314
            We've been coming
            for years.

12:29.316 --> 12:32.350
    It came with the 300 acres
        that surrounds it.

12:32.352 --> 12:33.918
    It's hidden
    in her shell corps

12:33.920 --> 12:36.254
    Under so many aliases
    nobody even knows

12:36.256 --> 12:37.489
        That mom owns it.

12:37.491 --> 12:39.691
        Fyi, there's
        nowhere to run.

12:39.693 --> 12:41.459
    We'll just find you,
        hurt you,

12:41.461 --> 12:42.994
    So you should probably
        just rest up.

12:42.996 --> 12:45.663
        Claire: Uh, rest up
        for--for what?

12:45.665 --> 12:47.799
Oh, we're having
a family dinner.

12:47.801 --> 12:50.168
So much to do.
I'll put the heat on,

12:50.170 --> 12:52.137
You watch her.

12:54.473 --> 12:55.774
Carroll: So how's this
gonna work?

12:55.776 --> 12:57.675
You just gonna turn me
over to the twins

12:57.677 --> 13:00.011
And then they're
gonna kill me?

13:00.013 --> 13:00.979
            If they don't,

13:00.981 --> 13:03.348
            I'll be standing
            nearby.

13:03.350 --> 13:05.350
I sincerely hope, ryan,

13:05.352 --> 13:07.452
That--that my death

13:07.454 --> 13:11.289
Brings you the salvation
you yearn for.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.458
Wherever I may be,

13:13.460 --> 13:15.126
I'll be rooting
for you.

13:15.128 --> 13:16.161
            Thanks, joe.

13:16.163 --> 13:18.396
            I'm kind of looking
            forward to it.

13:18.398 --> 13:20.031
Ha ha ha!

13:20.033 --> 13:21.833
        [tires squeal]

13:38.918 --> 13:41.719
        [grunting]

13:45.825 --> 13:49.194
Ugh. I was beginning
to wonder whether you
were gonna pitch up.

13:49.196 --> 13:50.361
            I followed you.

13:50.363 --> 13:54.499
            I had to wait
            until you got off
            the main roads.

13:54.501 --> 13:55.433
Unh! Ugh.

13:55.435 --> 13:58.236
Well, next time
you come to my rescue,

13:58.238 --> 14:01.573
Perhaps you could avoid
nearly bloody killing me!

14:01.575 --> 14:03.241
    Ohh!

14:03.243 --> 14:05.610
Damn that hurts!

14:12.384 --> 14:14.719
        Give me your gun.

14:16.055 --> 14:17.956
        [cocks gun]

14:21.460 --> 14:22.794
        You know, tim,

14:22.796 --> 14:25.129
    You really ought to
        think twice

14:25.131 --> 14:27.398
    Before rescuing me.

14:30.169 --> 14:32.270
        [grunting]

14:32.272 --> 14:36.608
    Come on, old friend.
        Come on.

14:36.610 --> 14:39.410
    It's not quite over yet.

14:39.412 --> 14:41.813
        There we are.

14:41.815 --> 14:45.149
    Come on, big fella.

14:45.151 --> 14:46.951
[groaning]

14:46.953 --> 14:49.287
Agh. Damn it.

14:57.997 --> 15:00.131

        and jupiter place

15:00.133 --> 15:02.166
        Isn't on the map.

15:03.402 --> 15:05.003
            We'll find it.

15:05.005 --> 15:07.305
Why aren't you answering
your phone, ryan?

15:07.307 --> 15:11.142
            Don't worry.
            Ryan's gonna be
            all right.

15:30.763 --> 15:34.866
Carroll: Just a little
ostentatious, isn't it?

15:50.549 --> 15:53.351
"you are cordially
invited to dinner.

15:53.353 --> 15:55.153
Please come in."

15:55.155 --> 15:57.655
            How very charming.

16:01.327 --> 16:02.327
Oh, come on, ryan.

16:02.329 --> 16:04.162
I thought we discussed
this last night.

16:04.164 --> 16:05.496
You're not gonna
shoot me.

16:05.498 --> 16:07.398
If you did, what's gonna
become of our claire?

16:07.400 --> 16:08.132
            Give me your gun.

16:08.134 --> 16:10.201
There is no way I'm
walking into that house

16:10.203 --> 16:11.502
Empty-handed.

16:11.504 --> 16:12.503
I saved your life.

16:12.505 --> 16:16.474
I'd like to think I've
earned a degree of trust.

16:19.745 --> 16:21.546
There.

16:33.492 --> 16:35.560
After you.

    Welcome, gentlemen.

18:14.194 --> 18:16.961
    I wanted you to see the room
        where it all began.

18:16.963 --> 18:19.797
    This is where mark
    and I planned everything.

18:19.799 --> 18:22.767
    Mark thought there was
    no way you were getting
    out of that church,

18:22.769 --> 18:25.503
        But I told him
    "you have to have faith.

18:25.505 --> 18:27.972
    Ryan hardy and joe carroll,
        they're badass."

18:27.974 --> 18:30.808
    Dinner's soon,
so make yourself comfortable,

18:30.810 --> 18:32.143
        Get a drink,

18:32.145 --> 18:35.646
    And if you're worried
        about claire,

18:35.648 --> 18:36.647
        Don't worry.

18:36.649 --> 18:37.648

Wait, wait.

18:59.405 --> 19:00.805
Could be a trap.

19:01.474 --> 19:05.309

        Hey. This is
        the first course.

21:23.316 --> 21:26.150
        Would you like
        a drink, ryan?

21:26.152 --> 21:28.853
        Come on.
        Tell the truth.

21:28.855 --> 21:29.854
        Yes or no?

21:29.856 --> 21:30.821
    No.

21:30.823 --> 21:32.156
Mark: He's not supposed
to drink. He's sober.

21:32.158 --> 21:33.991
You may not remember this,
but we've met before.

21:33.993 --> 21:35.793
When we were planning
this all out with mother,

21:35.795 --> 21:37.561
I used to come
to your morning meetings

21:37.563 --> 21:38.663
And watch you.

21:38.665 --> 21:40.865
I even introduced myself
as a newcomer.

21:40.867 --> 21:42.500
You shook my hand.

21:42.502 --> 21:43.634
            Carroll: Good
            for you, ryan.

21:43.636 --> 21:44.735
            It takes a lot
            of courage

21:44.737 --> 21:46.237
            To face your demons.
            Unh!

21:46.239 --> 21:47.805
    Nobody's talking to you.

21:47.807 --> 21:49.707
        I'll ask again.

21:49.709 --> 21:52.176
        Would you like
        a drink?

21:56.148 --> 21:58.082
    No.

22:02.487 --> 22:04.055
            Hmm?

22:09.494 --> 22:12.229
        Wait, wait, stop.
            No, no.

22:12.231 --> 22:13.064
            Aah!

22:13.066 --> 22:15.333
    No, no, no!

22:16.501 --> 22:19.837
        Ho ho ho!
        That was tense.

22:19.839 --> 22:20.905
    See how this works?

22:20.907 --> 22:22.006
    6 chambers, 1 bullet.

22:22.008 --> 22:24.041
        You lie,
    I pull the trigger.

22:24.043 --> 22:25.676
        Would you like
        a drink?

22:25.678 --> 22:27.345
Yes.

22:32.217 --> 22:34.452
        Chug, chug, chug.

22:34.454 --> 22:36.387
        Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:36.389 --> 22:38.222
        Yeah. Yeah.

22:38.224 --> 22:41.459
        All right. Yeah. Mmm.

22:41.461 --> 22:43.394
    [sputtering]

22:43.396 --> 22:44.962
        Mmm, mmm, mmm.

22:47.666 --> 22:49.734
        It's good vodka.

22:53.705 --> 22:56.640
            We'll go in on foot,
            look for security,
            surveillance.

22:56.642 --> 22:57.808
            Come in
            from the west.

22:57.810 --> 22:59.643
            Looks like
            quite a hike.

22:59.645 --> 23:01.912
            Hey. Are you
            good with this?

23:01.914 --> 23:04.248
Yeah, I'm good.

23:13.859 --> 23:15.993
        Ahh.

23:15.995 --> 23:19.230
        Do you know how much
        you hurt my mother, joe?

23:19.232 --> 23:21.999
        She exposed
    her true self to you.

23:22.001 --> 23:23.968
    She sacrificed everything,

23:23.970 --> 23:26.270
        And you just
        threw her aside.

23:26.272 --> 23:28.973
It was
a misunderstanding.

23:28.975 --> 23:31.842
            Wait, wait.
            No, no, no! Joe!

23:31.844 --> 23:33.911
        Do you know
    how much you hurt her?

23:33.913 --> 23:35.012
        Yes or no?

23:35.014 --> 23:35.579
Yes.

23:35.581 --> 23:39.784
Luke, now you and I,
mark, we're the same.

23:39.786 --> 23:41.619
We have the same
predilections.

23:41.621 --> 23:43.154
Let me make this right.

23:43.156 --> 23:46.791
Let me the father figure
to you that lily

23:46.793 --> 23:48.626
Always wanted me to be.

23:48.628 --> 23:49.693
            Too late.

23:49.695 --> 23:50.661
        Ryan: No, no, stop!

23:50.663 --> 23:51.595
            We don't need you.

23:51.597 --> 23:53.197
            Mother left us
            well provided for.

23:53.199 --> 23:55.266
        And why would we
        want you?

23:55.268 --> 23:56.467
        You're a failure.

23:56.469 --> 23:58.469
    Writer--fail;
    cult leader--fail;

23:58.471 --> 24:02.540
    And that big finale
    in the church--epic fail!

24:02.542 --> 24:05.276
            You should have
            stayed dead.

24:07.145 --> 24:09.346
What do you want
me to do?

24:09.348 --> 24:11.715
    Apologize for hurting
        our mother.

24:11.717 --> 24:13.117
            Or roll the dice
            and see if claire

24:13.119 --> 24:15.052
            Gets a bullet
            in the brain!
            Your choice!

24:15.054 --> 24:16.153
                No, no, no!

24:16.155 --> 24:17.455
    Luke: Shut up, ryan.
        You're next.

24:17.457 --> 24:18.689
    Let's hear it, joe.

24:18.691 --> 24:20.624
            Say it, say it.

24:20.626 --> 24:22.059
            Say it, say it!

24:22.061 --> 24:23.694
        Claire: No!

24:23.696 --> 24:24.895
I'm sorry.

24:24.897 --> 24:25.696
            What?!

24:25.698 --> 24:28.065
        I can't hear you!

24:28.067 --> 24:30.201
I am very sorry

24:30.203 --> 24:34.171
That I hurt
your mother.

24:34.173 --> 24:38.843
I'm a deeply flawed
individual, and...

24:40.912 --> 24:45.749
And not worthy
of such a woman.

24:45.751 --> 24:46.984
            I don't think it was
            very sincere,

24:46.986 --> 24:49.553
            And you know mother.
            She was a strict
            disciplinarian.

24:49.555 --> 24:52.590
        She firmly believed
        that the punishment
        should fit the crime.

24:52.592 --> 24:54.024
    Luke: Which is why
    we sentence you

24:54.026 --> 24:56.060
        To a slow death.

24:56.062 --> 24:57.161
    We're gonna dismember you,

24:57.163 --> 25:01.031
    We're gonna slice
    you up into tinier
    and tinier bits

25:01.033 --> 25:02.366
        Until there's
        nothing left.

25:02.368 --> 25:04.034
            Should take
            about 18 months.

25:04.036 --> 25:05.035
Oh, boys, boys.

25:05.037 --> 25:08.105
    Mark wants to
    start with ripping
    your tongue out,

25:08.107 --> 25:11.208
    But I really want to
    hear you beg.

25:11.210 --> 25:12.743
        It'll be fun.

25:12.745 --> 25:14.745
        So, ryan...

25:14.747 --> 25:16.380
        Back to you.

25:27.158 --> 25:28.626
    Luke: You killed our mother.

25:28.628 --> 25:29.727
    You were judge and jury.

25:29.729 --> 25:34.064
        You executed her
    in cold blood--yes or no?

25:34.066 --> 25:37.701
            Yeah, I did.

25:37.703 --> 25:38.402
            Now let her go

25:38.404 --> 25:39.703
            And give me
            my punishment.

25:39.705 --> 25:41.071
        That's not how
        this game works.

25:41.073 --> 25:42.573
    This is our dinner!

25:42.575 --> 25:43.574
We were so wrong
about you.

25:43.576 --> 25:46.210
You were supposed
to be the good guy, the hero.

25:46.212 --> 25:48.646
You can't just go around
playing vigilante.

25:48.648 --> 25:49.613
It's against the law.

25:49.615 --> 25:52.650
    You had no right
    to kill our mother!

25:52.652 --> 25:54.618
Oh. Exactly.

25:54.620 --> 25:55.886
Do you have any idea

25:55.888 --> 25:57.121
            How many people
            ryan has killed?

25:57.123 --> 26:00.658
            Far more than me,
            and that's just
            the simple truth.

26:00.660 --> 26:02.159
    Shut up.

26:02.161 --> 26:03.627
Mark: It's the height
of irony.

26:03.629 --> 26:06.096
You've become
the man you hate.

26:06.098 --> 26:07.898
You're no better than
the killers you hunt.

26:07.900 --> 26:09.767
        Carroll: Yes. Heh.
        He even has a cult

26:09.769 --> 26:12.169
        Of his own
        vigilante followers.

26:12.171 --> 26:13.304
        Take that mike weston.

26:13.306 --> 26:15.973
        He's a violent
        little runt--

26:15.975 --> 26:17.608
    He's got a good point,
            ryan.

26:17.610 --> 26:19.109
    Mike nearly killed me.

26:19.111 --> 26:20.344
    Whose fault's that?

26:20.346 --> 26:21.645
        He was following
        your example.

26:21.647 --> 26:22.613
    You corrupted him, ryan!

26:22.615 --> 26:23.914
            Carroll: Yes.
            He's even infected

26:23.916 --> 26:25.816
            That lovely niece
            of his--max!

26:25.818 --> 26:28.452
            Ruined her career,
            that's for sur--

26:28.454 --> 26:30.287
            So sorry.
            Won't happen again.

26:30.289 --> 26:34.692
You are supposed to be
the good guy, right?

26:34.694 --> 26:36.961
            I'm not good.

26:36.963 --> 26:38.629
            I know that.

26:38.631 --> 26:42.099
Oh, finally.
He admits it.

26:42.101 --> 26:43.167
    What happened to you?

26:43.169 --> 26:45.669
            Carroll:
            Well, he gave in
            to that most base

26:45.671 --> 26:48.939
            Of human emotions--
            revenge--

26:48.941 --> 26:52.309
            Just like you boys.

26:52.311 --> 26:54.111
        What?

26:55.814 --> 26:57.348
        I--I know
        your secret.

26:57.350 --> 26:59.016
    Yes, ryan, do you remember?
        Should I tell them?

26:59.018 --> 27:01.785
    Luke: You finally
    have something
    interesting to add?

27:01.787 --> 27:03.120
            Talk.

27:03.122 --> 27:06.190
        Well, when ryan
            was 17,

27:06.192 --> 27:08.359
    His father was killed,

27:08.361 --> 27:10.694
        And ryan,
    ever the detective,

27:10.696 --> 27:13.998
        Tracked down
        the perpetrator

27:14.000 --> 27:16.300
        And murdered him,

27:16.302 --> 27:19.503
    And he's been
    seeking redemption
    ever since,

27:19.505 --> 27:23.207
    Which is probably why
    he's so fixated on me.

27:23.209 --> 27:25.476
Mark: Is that true?

27:31.316 --> 27:34.518
            Yeah, it is.

27:36.287 --> 27:38.489
Tell me more.

27:44.696 --> 27:47.264
Why do you need
redemption?

27:47.266 --> 27:51.335
            I--I need to be
            forgiven,

27:51.337 --> 27:54.171
            But you can't
            be forgiven,
            not for that.

27:54.173 --> 27:56.907
            It's always there.
            Never goes away.

27:56.909 --> 27:58.275
            Who will forgive me?

27:58.277 --> 27:59.610
    God. God forgives.

27:59.612 --> 28:00.844
            There is no god!

28:00.846 --> 28:02.112
        You must forgive
        yourself.

28:02.114 --> 28:04.181
            I a not...
            The good guy.

28:04.183 --> 28:05.349
    But you try to be.

28:05.351 --> 28:06.250
            And I fail!

28:06.252 --> 28:08.185
Ryan.

28:27.072 --> 28:30.808
You're a remarkable man.

28:30.810 --> 28:32.209
We're gonna let you live.

28:32.211 --> 28:34.545
    But you still need
    to be punished,

28:34.547 --> 28:38.949
    So we're gonna kill
    max and mike,

28:38.951 --> 28:40.818
    And you're gonna have
    to suffer knowing

28:40.820 --> 28:43.053
    That they all died
    because of you.

28:43.055 --> 28:45.656
It's fitting, isn't it?

28:45.658 --> 28:47.558
    And I'm gonna start
    by killing claire.

28:47.560 --> 28:49.226
Ryan: No, no! Please! Stop!

28:49.228 --> 28:52.096
    I'm gonna blow her brains
    out right in front of you!

28:52.098 --> 28:53.497
                No!

28:53.499 --> 28:56.366
            [gunfire]

28:59.504 --> 29:01.171
    Aah!

29:01.173 --> 29:04.341
        [grunting]

29:04.343 --> 29:06.243
            Go for ryan.

29:07.278 --> 29:11.148
                We hit luke.
                He can't be far.

29:11.150 --> 29:13.484
Here. Take the gun.

29:35.206 --> 29:38.642
    Unh! Ohh!

30:08.239 --> 30:12.309
            You must really want
            me dead.

30:12.311 --> 30:15.412
You killed my father.

30:15.414 --> 30:20.017
I didn't think twice
about shooting your mother.

30:20.019 --> 30:23.086
            No. No. Ryan
            killed my mother.

30:23.088 --> 30:25.189
That's not true.

30:25.191 --> 30:29.693
I did without blinking.

30:31.095 --> 30:34.498
            He did it!
            He did it, luke!

30:34.500 --> 30:37.034
He killed mom!

30:38.269 --> 30:40.103
            [gunshot]

30:40.105 --> 30:41.738
            Unh!

30:50.381 --> 30:52.115
    Luke.

31:09.167 --> 31:11.268
            Mike!

31:11.270 --> 31:11.902
                Mike.

31:11.904 --> 31:16.240
            Mike, mike, mike,
            mike, mike.

31:16.242 --> 31:17.241
                Mike.

31:17.243 --> 31:20.310
            You're ok. Come on.
            Mike?

31:20.312 --> 31:21.812
    Ohh.

31:24.382 --> 31:26.650
            Oh, god.

31:26.652 --> 31:30.087
[groans]

31:30.089 --> 31:31.755
            [sighs]

31:34.993 --> 31:37.594
                Aah! Aah!

31:40.431 --> 31:44.468
            Oh, claire. Oh.

31:44.470 --> 31:46.603
[whimpers]

31:46.605 --> 31:49.273
            Oh. I missed you.

31:49.275 --> 31:50.741
Joe, let go,
let go of me.

31:50.743 --> 31:55.679
            I've never been able
            to do that, have I?

31:55.681 --> 31:58.782
            Do--do you know
            what you mean to me?

31:58.784 --> 32:01.852
            When--when I thought
            you'd died--

32:01.854 --> 32:02.986
Yeah, because of you!

32:02.988 --> 32:07.324
            Yes, yes.
            Because of me.

32:07.326 --> 32:08.625
            We were both dead,

32:08.627 --> 32:10.460
            But now we're--
            we're not.

32:10.462 --> 32:11.428
            Don't you see?
            There is

32:11.430 --> 32:15.499
            An extraordinary
            symmetry in that?

32:15.501 --> 32:17.801
            Don't you see?

32:17.803 --> 32:20.137
            We belong together.

32:20.139 --> 32:22.439
I'd rather be dead.

32:22.441 --> 32:27.177
            I--I understand,
            but before anyone
            else dies,

32:27.179 --> 32:28.879
            This might well be
            the last time

32:28.881 --> 32:31.615
            I see you face
            to face.

32:31.617 --> 32:35.018
            That's what
            I wanted to say.

32:35.020 --> 32:38.522
            I am...Sorry.

32:38.524 --> 32:39.323
No.

32:39.325 --> 32:42.292
            Yes. I am so
            terribly sorry

32:42.294 --> 32:44.561
            For everything I've
            ever done to you

32:44.563 --> 32:48.498
            And everything
            I have ever done

32:48.500 --> 32:50.901
            To our little boy.

32:50.903 --> 32:54.638
            You must tell him
            that, claire.

32:54.640 --> 32:55.572
No.

32:55.574 --> 32:57.174
            Forgive me.

32:57.176 --> 32:58.041
No.

32:58.043 --> 32:59.309
No, joe. I will never
forgive you.

32:59.311 --> 33:01.178
I will never, ever
forgive you. No.

33:01.180 --> 33:02.679
    -Please forgive me.
        -No!

33:02.681 --> 33:03.880
            Forgive me!

33:03.882 --> 33:05.482
No!

33:19.530 --> 33:22.666
        Do it!

33:22.668 --> 33:25.535
        Do it!

33:25.537 --> 33:28.205
        Do it, ryan.

33:31.142 --> 33:32.876
        Do it.

33:39.984 --> 33:42.219
        Do it, ryan.

33:50.461 --> 33:52.796
        Do it.

34:15.719 --> 34:18.054
            Call clarke.

34:20.190 --> 34:22.559
            Arrest him.

34:39.177 --> 34:40.243
You should have
included me.

34:40.245 --> 34:41.678
        They had claire,
    the threatened to kill her

34:41.679 --> 34:43.647
    If I brought anyone
        with me.

34:43.649 --> 34:44.748
Mike: Anything on mark?

34:44.750 --> 34:46.315
        Yeah. We're canvassing
        the surround area now,

34:46.318 --> 34:49.753
        But there's no sign
        of luke's dead body
        anywhere either.

34:49.755 --> 34:54.091
Hey. Luke is dead,
lily's dead.

34:54.092 --> 34:57.994
So is the rest
of their family.

34:57.996 --> 35:00.130
We'll find mark.

35:32.797 --> 35:34.397
Mike: Ryan.

35:34.399 --> 35:37.000
Why didn't you
kill him?

35:38.469 --> 35:42.038
            Because this needs
            to end, mike.

35:59.023 --> 36:00.824
            -Hey.
            -Hey.

36:00.826 --> 36:01.591
            You ok?

36:01.593 --> 36:04.528
Yeah. I think so, yeah.

36:04.530 --> 36:06.696
You did
the right thing.

36:06.698 --> 36:08.765
You know that, right?

36:10.801 --> 36:14.838
            I was thinking I
            could, uh, go home,

36:14.840 --> 36:17.707
            Pack a bag,
            come back with you,

36:17.709 --> 36:19.910
            Spend some time
            with you and joey.

36:19.912 --> 36:22.245
Ryan.

36:22.247 --> 36:24.548
I think we both know
that that's--

36:24.550 --> 36:27.017
That's not
gonna work.

36:29.387 --> 36:32.255
            Why not?

36:32.257 --> 36:33.590
            We have
            a chance now.

36:33.592 --> 36:34.891
            Joe's gone,
            this is over,

36:34.893 --> 36:35.959
            You and I can
            finally--

36:35.961 --> 36:37.727
He's always gonna
be there, ryan.

36:37.729 --> 36:38.562
            Claire.

36:38.564 --> 36:40.530
This is what we're
gonna do.

36:40.532 --> 36:41.965
I'm gonna go see my son,

36:41.967 --> 36:45.869
And I'm gonna stop looking
over my shoulder all the time,

36:45.871 --> 36:48.271
And I'm gonna tell joey
that--that we can

36:48.273 --> 36:49.539
Actually have a life now

36:49.541 --> 36:50.807
And maybe even someday
enjoy it,

36:50.809 --> 36:52.275
And you're gonna do
the same thing.

36:52.277 --> 36:53.710
            Why can't we do
            that together?

36:53.712 --> 36:56.213
Because
I'm your past.

36:56.215 --> 37:00.050
Ryan, you deserve
a future, we both do.

37:02.153 --> 37:05.722
            But I love you.

37:05.724 --> 37:08.992
And, uh, I love you,

37:08.994 --> 37:12.095
But this is the way
it has to be.

37:16.334 --> 37:18.568
Go build a future
for yourself, ryan,

37:18.570 --> 37:21.071
Whatever that is.

38:02.246 --> 38:03.947
            I wouldn't have done
            what ryan did.

38:03.949 --> 38:05.181
            I would have
            shot him.

38:05.183 --> 38:08.952
No, you wouldn't,
not now.

38:08.954 --> 38:11.721
            I'm not as good
            as you think I am.

38:11.723 --> 38:14.891
I never thought
you were perfect.

38:30.508 --> 38:32.575
Finally.

38:54.332 --> 38:57.000
        You should have
        killed me, ryan.

38:57.002 --> 38:57.934
No, I'm good.

38:57.936 --> 39:02.405
    Choosing to save your
    own soul instead, huh?

39:02.407 --> 39:03.773
        Well, I hope
        it goes well.

39:03.775 --> 39:05.575
I'll let you know.

39:05.577 --> 39:07.844
            Will you?

39:07.846 --> 39:10.113
        Please. Visit me.

39:10.115 --> 39:15.218
No. You won't be
seeing me anymore, joe.

39:15.220 --> 39:17.954
I would never
give you that.

39:17.956 --> 39:20.790
You're gonna die
in prison,

39:20.792 --> 39:23.960
And as you wither
away in there,

39:23.962 --> 39:29.466
You're gonna be fading
from my memory every day

39:29.468 --> 39:31.034
A little bit more

39:31.036 --> 39:33.370
Because I'll be making
new memories

39:33.372 --> 39:38.141
From a new life that
doesn't include you.

39:40.578 --> 39:44.814
        Well, good luck
        with that.

39:46.751 --> 39:48.718
                Let's go.

40:35.699 --> 40:38.501
            [beeping]

40:40.704 --> 40:42.505
        [drops keys]

41:41.866 --> 41:43.566
        [grunts]

41:45.269 --> 41:47.237
        [gasps]

41:53.277 --> 41:56.346
You're a dead man,
ryan hardy.

41:56.348 --> 41:58.281
            [gasps]

42:08.125 --> 42:10.026
            Heh heh.

42:10.028 --> 42:12.262
            [sighs]

42:47.331 --> 42:48.731
Thank you for coming.

42:48.733 --> 42:51.634
I didn't know
who else to call.
