00:00.622 --> 00:02.099
Okay, Emma, next question:

00:02.100 --> 00:04.189
I need two words to describe your daddy.

00:04.190 --> 00:06.468
- Ha.
- Fun.

00:06.469 --> 00:08.770
Well, you wouldn't be
here if I wasn't, right?

00:09.548 --> 00:12.531
Ben, I can't believe you signed
up for match-making night.

00:12.997 --> 00:15.313
Someone having trouble meeting girls?

00:15.947 --> 00:17.136
No.

00:17.137 --> 00:20.598
But if a computer's gonna help me
custom-build one, I say why not?

00:20.599 --> 00:23.521
- (Scoffs)
- It's a girl, not a burger.

00:23.522 --> 00:24.993
<i>(Ben laughs)</i>

00:24.994 --> 00:27.076
One of my clients actually met her husband

00:27.077 --> 00:28.780
through one of these
match-making thingies...

00:28.781 --> 00:31.284
- See? It does work.
- ...And then she tried to kill him.

00:33.123 --> 00:35.820
I believe the word you're
glossing over is "tried."

00:38.374 --> 00:41.607
No no no. Ben, you do not want
to meet Gretchen Schilling.

00:41.608 --> 00:43.858
Truly the scariest client I've ever had.

00:43.859 --> 00:46.570
Wait wait wait, Gretchen Schilling?

00:46.571 --> 00:48.596
Didn't you try to set me up with her?

00:50.267 --> 00:54.227
Yes, but that was before I
was 100% sure she was guilty.

00:55.182 --> 00:57.162
- (Mouths)
- Which is why I'm asking a computer

00:57.163 --> 00:58.823
to set me up instead of you.

00:58.824 --> 01:01.184
In a few hours I'll be
standing face-to-face

01:01.185 --> 01:02.743
with my dream girl.

01:03.325 --> 01:06.242
13. 13 here.

01:06.243 --> 01:08.149
Any takers? (Chuckles)

01:09.027 --> 01:10.823
(Clears throat) 13?

01:10.824 --> 01:13.041
<i>Bonnie: Is somebody looking for 13?</i>

01:14.980 --> 01:16.534
Mom?

01:31.091 --> 01:32.498
How could this happen?

01:32.499 --> 01:35.428
How could someone so awesome
end up with someone so...

01:35.937 --> 01:38.033
- Equally awesome?
- Uh-huh.

01:38.908 --> 01:41.531
Don't think I'm excited to
find out I can't do better

01:41.532 --> 01:44.181
than a bartender whose
mother still cleans his room.

01:44.710 --> 01:46.624
I wore my lucky bra for this.

01:47.716 --> 01:49.631
If everyone else's matches were this awful,

01:49.632 --> 01:51.974
there's gotta be a bunch
of lonely lookers out there.

01:52.801 --> 01:56.065
Oh! There's a girl I
could bring home to mom.

01:56.066 --> 02:00.198
Oh, Benji, so young, so innocent,

02:00.199 --> 02:02.965
I can smell her marital boredom from here.

02:03.680 --> 02:04.955
Plus her husband hit on me

02:04.956 --> 02:06.548
at the dry-cleaner's last week...

02:07.362 --> 02:09.572
Which may explain why she's here.

02:10.610 --> 02:13.521
- What about that one?
- Oh God no.

02:13.522 --> 02:15.689
<i>The boobs, the hair, the nose... all fake.</i>

02:15.690 --> 02:17.722
The maintenance alone would break you.

02:18.700 --> 02:20.545
Wow. I didn't know you
were so good at this.

02:20.546 --> 02:23.349
Oh, Ben, the things you don't know about me

02:23.350 --> 02:25.387
could fill an adult bookstore.

02:26.482 --> 02:27.989
I can't believe I'm gonna ask you this,

02:27.990 --> 02:31.328
but... will you be my wingmom?

02:31.875 --> 02:34.926
Wait. For the first time in history,

02:34.927 --> 02:38.146
a son actually wants his mother's
opinion on who to go out with?

02:38.147 --> 02:39.644
Yeah, I do.

02:40.133 --> 02:42.222
I think I'm gonna cry.

02:43.800 --> 02:48.617
Almost there. Wait for it.

02:48.618 --> 02:51.652
- Ta-da!
- (Gasps) That is so cool!

02:51.653 --> 02:53.753
(Laughs) The laundromat re-opened.

02:54.383 --> 02:55.708
So that means they never found out

02:55.709 --> 02:57.818
who was responsible for the drier fire.

02:58.701 --> 03:01.592
- Right?
- No no, not the laundromat...

03:01.593 --> 03:05.086
- the car! Adele the chevelle...
- Oh my God.

03:05.087 --> 03:06.797
The only woman my dad truly loved.

03:06.798 --> 03:09.435
Wait, I thought your mom made
him sell that car in the divorce.

03:09.436 --> 03:11.532
Well, yeah, he said he'd do a
lot of things that he didn't,

03:11.533 --> 03:14.633
like stay married to
her and not hit on guys.

03:15.463 --> 03:18.054
Which reminds me... do
not tell my mom about this.

03:18.055 --> 03:20.558
Wait. So what are you gonna do with it?

03:20.559 --> 03:23.157
And by "you," I mean "we."

03:23.158 --> 03:25.932
Well, he's finally coming to pick
it up out of storage in a week,

03:25.933 --> 03:28.084
so I said I'd make sure she's ready.

03:28.085 --> 03:30.606
And how could I do that
without a little test drive?

03:30.607 --> 03:32.730
- (Laughs)
- Which will probably last a week.

03:32.731 --> 03:35.331
And I know where we are going first...

03:35.332 --> 03:36.786
- the beach.
- (Gasps)

03:36.787 --> 03:40.183
We're gonna take this hot
rod to meet some hot bods.

03:40.895 --> 03:43.359
Yeah, but the beach is only the first stop.

03:43.360 --> 03:46.284
I've been waiting to drive
this car my entire life.

03:46.648 --> 03:49.736
- (Tires screech)
- My life just flashed before my eyes.

03:50.710 --> 03:52.373
This is never happening again.

03:52.374 --> 03:54.298
- We only went around the block.
- (Pants)

03:54.299 --> 03:56.404
But that block was like a war zone,

03:56.405 --> 03:59.669
with 200 giant yellow
tanks all aiming for Adele.

04:00.219 --> 04:01.819
I believe they're called taxis.

04:01.820 --> 04:04.006
Yeah. Bro, you were going so slow,

04:04.007 --> 04:06.275
I bought a hot dog from the back seat.

04:06.853 --> 04:09.736
Just one mark on this car
and my dad will disown me.

04:09.737 --> 04:11.464
You know what? I totally get it,

04:11.465 --> 04:14.316
and I don't want you to do anything
you're not comfortable with.

04:14.317 --> 04:16.901
So why don't you take Emma upstairs

04:16.902 --> 04:18.947
and we will make sure
everything is spotless?

04:18.947 --> 04:20.863
- (Sighs) Thanks, tuck.
- Yeah.

04:22.591 --> 04:24.472
<i>- (Emma fusses)
- (Car honks)</i>

04:24.985 --> 04:28.081
- Don't forget the keys.
- Oh, I won't. (Laughs)

04:29.944 --> 04:31.357
Whoo. Okay.

04:32.917 --> 04:34.443
Whoa. Hey, what are you doing?

04:34.444 --> 04:36.204
- I'm going to the beach.
- (Scoffs)

04:36.577 --> 04:39.419
I have to. I already updated my status.

04:40.132 --> 04:43.283
Hey, I know that you boys
have no morals or integrity,

04:43.284 --> 04:45.390
but I will not lie to Danny like that.

04:45.391 --> 04:47.599
All right? He's my best
friend and we have a code.

04:47.600 --> 04:49.441
I'll let you drive on the way back.

04:49.442 --> 04:51.021
- Code broken. I'm in.
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

04:51.339 --> 04:53.170
<i>- (Engine starts)
- Whoo!</i>

04:53.799 --> 04:56.516
I call this one "the Ben,"
because it's strong, smooth

04:56.517 --> 04:58.034
and might just get you in trouble.

04:59.257 --> 05:01.713
Okay, thanks for playing.

05:01.714 --> 05:05.215
We'll see you next time on
"who wants to date my son?"

05:05.216 --> 05:07.756
- Okay, bye-bye.
- Mom, what are you doing?

05:07.757 --> 05:09.427
You're the one who told me to
talk to her in the first place.

05:09.428 --> 05:11.390
Yeah, for practice...

05:11.391 --> 05:12.990
Until I found you a good one,

05:12.991 --> 05:15.810
which I just did... In the men's room.

05:16.747 --> 05:18.531
- And that's why you're my wingmom.
- Yeah.

05:18.532 --> 05:20.871
I never would've thought to look
for a girl in the men's room.

05:20.872 --> 05:22.668
Uh-huh. Yeah, well, she's
gonna be out here any minute,

05:22.669 --> 05:25.135
so stand up straight, fix your collar

05:25.136 --> 05:26.616
and whatever you do...

05:26.617 --> 05:28.271
(Deep voice) Don't be yourself.

05:34.128 --> 05:38.211
- Yeah, all clear.
- Maybe if we don't say anything, he won't notice.

05:38.212 --> 05:40.896
Really? Yeah, I think he's gonna notice

05:40.897 --> 05:42.615
that he's missing this.

05:44.131 --> 05:46.449
But I mean, you never know.
Maybe the giant scratch

05:46.450 --> 05:48.510
on the side of the door will distract him.

05:49.296 --> 05:51.991
You know, I can't believe
I let you talk me into this.

05:51.992 --> 05:54.629
Oh, you are not pinning this
on me. You were the one driving.

05:54.630 --> 05:56.539
Oh, but you were the one screaming at me.

05:56.540 --> 05:59.496
Yeah, I was screaming,
"watch out for that mailbox!"

06:02.604 --> 06:05.408
You know what? Turning on each
other is not gonna fix anything.

06:05.409 --> 06:07.604
So here's what we're gonna
do: I'll call the body shop

06:07.605 --> 06:09.613
<i>- and you make sure that Danny does not...
- (Door opens)</i>

06:09.614 --> 06:12.569
- Hey.
- Oh, hey, guys. Where've you been?

06:12.570 --> 06:13.979
- Shopping.
- Coffee.

06:14.495 --> 06:16.614
- Shopping...
- For coffee.

06:18.444 --> 06:20.338
- We didn't find any.
- No. (Clears throat)

06:20.927 --> 06:23.775
- But Riley was just walking me home.
- Yeah.

06:23.776 --> 06:27.099
- So there you go. Bye.
- Bye.

06:31.607 --> 06:32.288
(Chuckles)

06:33.481 --> 06:35.868
Well, I was just going to
go say good night to Adele.

06:35.869 --> 06:37.337
Now? No, she's fine.

06:37.338 --> 06:38.373
Yeah, we were just down there.

06:38.374 --> 06:39.834
She's all tucked in for the night.

06:40.883 --> 06:43.077
Oh, look, Ben's here. Hey,
Ben. Let's talk to Ben.

06:43.078 --> 06:45.406
Tell us something, anything.
Please, I beg of you.

06:46.686 --> 06:47.580
You know, you're not gonna believe it,

06:47.581 --> 06:49.288
but I think mom has found
me the perfect woman.

06:49.714 --> 06:51.997
Oh, last week she found
me the perfect shirt.

06:51.998 --> 06:53.391
Man, she's on a roll.

06:54.157 --> 06:55.970
Just... (Laughs)

06:55.971 --> 06:58.277
I'm telling you, man,
that woman is amazing.

06:58.278 --> 07:02.079
Oh God! How hot is it in that elevator?

07:03.017 --> 07:05.422
Whew! It's more like a hell-evator.

07:06.456 --> 07:08.172
Though that shouldn't
affect you, Tuck Tuck,

07:08.173 --> 07:10.422
since heat tends to rise. Bwa-dup!

07:13.936 --> 07:16.883
So, Benji, how did it go with Bailey?

07:16.884 --> 07:19.092
I mean, was I right or was I right?

07:19.093 --> 07:21.307
You were so right. We already had lunch

07:21.308 --> 07:23.089
- she's on her way over here for dinner.
- Yes.

07:23.090 --> 07:26.320
And if all goes well, I'll
be serving her breakfast.

07:26.321 --> 07:29.852
Oh yeah, that's my boy!
Yeah! Yeah, you know what?

07:29.853 --> 07:31.231
I probably shouldn't be
doing that with my son.

07:31.232 --> 07:32.615
That's weird. Okay.

07:33.836 --> 07:37.432
It's funny, but I already feel like
I've known Bailey my whole life.

07:37.433 --> 07:40.220
Knock knock! Whoo!

07:40.221 --> 07:43.001
That elevator is quite the slow cooker.

07:44.295 --> 07:46.268
You should call that thing an oven-ator.

07:48.154 --> 07:50.526
Well, aren't you adorable?

07:50.527 --> 07:52.506
I guess this apartment doesn't
have a height restriction.

07:52.507 --> 07:54.812
- Boop boop boop.
- (Laughs)

07:57.024 --> 07:58.723
Yo. Yo, isn't she hilarious?

07:58.724 --> 08:02.230
I don't know. It's hard
to hear from down here.

08:04.117 --> 08:08.228
Bailey, this is Tucker, this is my
brother Danny and you know my mom.

08:08.229 --> 08:10.853
- Bons.
- Bails.

08:11.601 --> 08:13.467
So can I get you a glass of wine?

08:13.468 --> 08:15.172
Just one? What is this, church?

08:15.173 --> 08:16.563
Oh!

08:18.824 --> 08:21.078
So what do you think? Isn't she great?

08:21.079 --> 08:22.972
(Both laugh)

08:23.680 --> 08:26.421
- (Both snort)
- Oh my God. I know, right?

08:28.170 --> 08:29.956
I think you're dating mom.

08:32.302 --> 08:34.383
Both: Don't you just love her?

08:34.384 --> 08:35.845
Jinx!

08:37.277 --> 08:38.967
I don't see it. I don't.

08:44.099 --> 08:47.162
I gotta say, I like a girl
who brings her own toothbrush.

08:47.922 --> 08:50.144
Not my first bedroom rodeo, Benji.

08:51.259 --> 08:54.781
Benji? Is there any way
you can not call me that?

08:54.782 --> 08:56.599
That's kind of what my mom calls me.

08:56.600 --> 08:58.835
Oh my God, how much do I love her?

08:58.836 --> 09:01.328
It turns out we have the same
hair girl, the same pilates girl

09:01.329 --> 09:04.777
and the same nail girl.
Her girls are my girls.

09:04.778 --> 09:06.437
It's like we're the same girl.

09:07.497 --> 09:10.569
Yeah, if we could possibly
stop talking about my mom,

09:10.570 --> 09:12.362
that would be super helpful.

09:12.961 --> 09:14.849
You know what else might be helpful?

09:15.370 --> 09:18.689
If I slip out of something comfortable.

09:18.690 --> 09:21.409
Bingo. Yeah, that would do it.

09:21.410 --> 09:23.779
- Should I dim the lights?
- Don't bother.

09:23.780 --> 09:25.886
I wore my lucky bra for this.

09:26.966 --> 09:28.626
What you say?

09:29.697 --> 09:32.062
I said come to mama.

09:32.643 --> 09:35.072
- (Screams)
- Are you all right?

09:36.104 --> 09:38.155
I don't think I'm ever gonna be all right.

09:39.081 --> 09:40.513
We need to break up.

09:43.030 --> 09:44.205
<i>(Door closes)</i>

09:44.206 --> 09:45.338
Okay, I talked to the body shop

09:45.339 --> 09:46.792
and they said we could have
it back by the end of the day.

09:46.793 --> 09:49.956
- Where are the keys?
- I hid them where Danny would never look.

09:53.363 --> 09:55.747
I mean, that dude ain't done
a dish since he moved in.

09:55.748 --> 09:57.189
You know what I'm saying?

09:58.863 --> 10:00.395
Great, come on, let's
get out of here. Awesome.

10:00.876 --> 10:02.332
Oh!

10:04.623 --> 10:06.622
Perfect, you found my keys.

10:06.623 --> 10:09.352
You know what? I've been
thinking. I'm being an idiot.

10:09.353 --> 10:12.708
Millions of people drive in this city
every day without getting in an accident.

10:12.709 --> 10:16.245
(Laughs) Probably not as many as you think.

10:17.611 --> 10:19.364
- No, not.
- Well, Adele and I are going to the beach

10:19.365 --> 10:21.247
with or without you two. It's your call.

10:21.692 --> 10:23.078
Yeah.

10:23.079 --> 10:24.574
(Both mouthing)

10:25.305 --> 10:27.618
Oh well, the beach sounds great,

10:27.619 --> 10:28.963
so we'll meet you by the car.

10:28.964 --> 10:30.693
Yeah, hey, thanks for grabbing everything.

10:33.961 --> 10:36.659
What do you mean you're
not gonna see her anymore?

10:36.660 --> 10:39.129
- Don't you find her attractive?
- Yeah, I do,

10:39.521 --> 10:41.641
which has it's own set of issues.

10:41.642 --> 10:44.331
Honey, she is the best thing
that ever happened to you.

10:44.332 --> 10:47.167
Look, mom, I'm sorry, but I've
already told her flat out it's over.

10:47.168 --> 10:48.792
Bailey and I are done.

10:49.103 --> 10:50.379
Hey, guys.

10:50.690 --> 10:53.693
Baby, you look so cute
in your little uniform.

10:54.128 --> 10:57.749
- What are you doing here?
- Just visiting my man at work.

10:57.750 --> 10:59.274
Oh. (Mouths)

10:59.275 --> 11:00.740
Well, I hope you mean this guy,

11:00.741 --> 11:03.429
because if I recall, we decided
to stop seeing each other.

11:03.430 --> 11:05.209
No, as I recall,

11:05.210 --> 11:07.684
you decided and now I'm undeciding for you.

11:07.685 --> 11:09.741
Did you miss the part
where I said we were done?

11:09.742 --> 11:11.365
Followed by the text
that said we were done,

11:11.366 --> 11:12.734
followed by the phone call and email

11:12.735 --> 11:14.563
that I believe were similarly themed?

11:14.564 --> 11:16.098
Ben, you might not know this,

11:16.099 --> 11:18.371
but I'm the best thing
that ever happened to you.

11:18.372 --> 11:20.569
But we can talk about it more
when you get home from work.

11:20.570 --> 11:23.178
Home? We don't have a home.

11:23.179 --> 11:25.731
Sure we do. I was just there
cleaning out some drawers.

11:28.128 --> 11:29.950
Wait, how'd you get in my apartment?

11:29.951 --> 11:31.553
Oh, I made a copy of your keys.

11:32.317 --> 11:34.184
You made a copy of my keys?

11:34.185 --> 11:36.238
Yeah. Oh, and...

11:37.527 --> 11:39.978
Here's your mail. See you later, Benji-boo.

11:41.207 --> 11:42.455
How do you feel about chicken for dinner?

11:42.456 --> 11:45.011
Oh! Never mind, I'll surprise you.

11:46.558 --> 11:49.986
Oh! Come by any time,
Bons. We'd love to have you.

11:54.289 --> 11:58.011
Well, I think somebody owes
their mother an apology.

11:58.693 --> 12:00.267
She is nothing like me.

12:00.268 --> 12:01.911
She is nuts!

12:02.929 --> 12:04.379
I've gotta get those keys back.

12:04.380 --> 12:05.982
Oh yeah, you've gotta get those keys back.

12:07.895 --> 12:11.038
There, super glue and duct tape.

12:11.677 --> 12:13.292
This is never gonna work.

12:13.293 --> 12:15.091
It just needs to get us to the beach.

12:15.092 --> 12:16.680
And then once we're
there, we'll be all like,

12:16.681 --> 12:18.743
"oh my God, Danny,
somebody sideswiped the car

12:18.744 --> 12:21.170
and then tried to super glue
and duct tape it back together."

12:22.343 --> 12:24.161
- Here he comes.
- Hey.

12:24.162 --> 12:26.694
Hey, guys, ready to go? Oh my God!

12:27.592 --> 12:28.935
I think I forgot the chips.

12:29.892 --> 12:31.483
All right, that's okay. Who needs 'em?

12:31.484 --> 12:32.629
All right, hop hop, chop chop,

12:32.630 --> 12:34.333
'cause you don't want your mom walking by

12:34.334 --> 12:36.055
and catching you in a great big lie.

12:36.056 --> 12:37.724
- Nope. (Laughs)
- Thanks, guys.

12:37.725 --> 12:40.770
- Thank you.
- Great.

12:40.771 --> 12:42.745
Oh my God, I think we're pulling it off.

12:42.746 --> 12:44.263
Don't jinx it, don't jinx it.

12:46.793 --> 12:50.161
<i>- (Engine starts)
- Riley: Right, here we go.</i>

12:51.837 --> 12:53.182
<i>- Tucker:  Cool.
- Bailey!</i>

12:53.183 --> 12:54.412
- Riley: Let's go.
- Ready to go?

12:54.413 --> 12:55.709
(Chuckles)

12:57.965 --> 12:59.424
- Hey, what happened to the...
- Oh! Look out!

13:00.421 --> 13:02.379
Bailey, are you okay?

13:02.380 --> 13:04.379
(Gasps) Oh my God.

13:05.633 --> 13:08.255
Is this your father's car?!

13:13.823 --> 13:17.375
Okay, you just let us know if
you need anything, Bailey-bee.

13:17.376 --> 13:21.771
Pillow, tea, perhaps a
bus ticket to crazy town?

13:22.539 --> 13:23.655
Well?

13:24.728 --> 13:26.612
Well, it's just a bruised wrist,

13:26.613 --> 13:28.725
so unfortunately she's gonna make it.

13:30.545 --> 13:33.151
Yo, is it wrong to hit someone with a car

13:33.152 --> 13:35.169
and a restraining order on the same day?

13:36.273 --> 13:38.363
If only it were that simple.

13:38.364 --> 13:40.094
It seems if you break up with her,

13:40.095 --> 13:42.676
she's gonna sue Danny
for everything he's worth,

13:42.677 --> 13:45.354
which I'd be fine with if I
didn't get 15% off the top.

13:47.111 --> 13:48.630
Mom, you have to fix this.

13:48.631 --> 13:50.868
You're the one that brought
itsy-bitsy Bonnie into our lives.

13:51.807 --> 13:53.449
Oh! And... yeah, well, you're the one

13:53.450 --> 13:55.910
who mowed her down with dad's mistress,

13:55.911 --> 13:58.561
that two-door whore Adrienne.

13:58.562 --> 14:00.587
You know her name is Adele, mom.

14:00.588 --> 14:02.753
- I don't care what her name is!
- (Shouting)

14:02.754 --> 14:03.881
I need all of us to focus!

14:03.882 --> 14:05.001
It's not really the problem right now!

14:06.007 --> 14:08.599
Since you seem to have one or
two things in common with Bailey,

14:08.600 --> 14:10.145
what would get rid of you?

14:12.382 --> 14:15.476
Well, probably a single
dad who works for tips

14:15.477 --> 14:17.747
and lives with a giant and a dwarf!

14:20.328 --> 14:23.160
But since that hasn't worked, I don't know!

14:23.891 --> 14:27.189
Great. So she's the mother
of the mother of all crazies.

14:28.953 --> 14:30.177
That's it.

14:30.487 --> 14:33.792
You just have to out-crazy the crazy.

14:35.460 --> 14:38.196
- I think I know how to fix this.
- You do?

14:38.197 --> 14:41.238
Oh yeah, that Ray Wheeler is gonna rue

14:41.239 --> 14:44.402
the day he tried to hide
Annabelle and double-cross me!

14:44.403 --> 14:47.223
- Mom, you know it's "Adele"!
- I don't care what her name is!

14:47.224 --> 14:48.397
Okay, mom!

14:49.241 --> 14:52.086
Again, kinda missing the real issue here.

14:52.087 --> 14:54.439
No, I'm not. It's parked right downstairs.

14:57.026 --> 14:58.496
Well, I think mom's out.

14:59.527 --> 15:03.110
- Now what are we supposed to do?
- (Cellphone buzzing)

15:03.111 --> 15:04.516
It's Riley's phone.

15:05.432 --> 15:07.005
Pete's auto body?

15:08.085 --> 15:11.421
Riley, that girl's body
bouncing off the windshield

15:11.422 --> 15:13.547
is the best thing that's
every happened to us.

15:14.465 --> 15:16.081
You know, just play it cool

15:16.082 --> 15:17.878
and he'll blame all the damage on her.

15:18.987 --> 15:22.400
Great. You're right. I can do this.

15:22.401 --> 15:24.509
"Scratch? What scratch?"

15:26.338 --> 15:28.102
(Beeps, clatters)

15:28.103 --> 15:29.328
That was the repair guy.

15:29.329 --> 15:31.068
(Panicky) Scratch? What scratch?

15:32.405 --> 15:34.672
The scratch he got when he hit Bailey,

15:34.978 --> 15:37.044
and the scratch that your good friend Riley

15:37.349 --> 15:39.560
already called to have
taken care of for you.

15:39.561 --> 15:43.271
Oh yeah, that's me, just
always thinking ahead.

15:44.570 --> 15:46.161
So far ahead, you actually called

15:46.162 --> 15:48.543
- a whole day before the accident?
- (Chuckles)

15:49.557 --> 15:50.819
I got nothing.

15:52.328 --> 15:54.871
I'm so sorry. I don't know what happened.

15:55.276 --> 15:57.433
Okay, that mailbox just
jumped out of nowhere.

15:58.741 --> 16:01.041
I'm sorry, I just... I
don't know, I panicked.

16:01.042 --> 16:03.012
I mean, a mailbox is federal property.

16:03.013 --> 16:06.080
I could go to jail. I could
end up like Gretchen Schilling,

16:06.081 --> 16:08.480
behind bars with a stainless steel toilet

16:08.481 --> 16:10.933
and... and no hair
product. (Breathing heavily)

16:11.536 --> 16:13.257
I wouldn't make it.

16:13.258 --> 16:16.088
I mean, those girls are
even crazier than that one.

16:18.783 --> 16:21.043
Oh my God, that's exactly what we need.

16:21.044 --> 16:23.937
- Oh my God, Ben, listen...
- No no no no, it's like what mom said,

16:23.938 --> 16:25.877
we need to out-crazy the crazy.

16:25.878 --> 16:27.615
- Where's Gretchen these days?
- No. No no no.

16:27.616 --> 16:29.958
Ben, I am not calling
the scariest person I know

16:29.959 --> 16:32.059
to come threaten your new roommate.

16:32.060 --> 16:34.926
Oh, so you would rather
let your best friend

16:34.927 --> 16:37.257
get dragged into court
for something both myself

16:37.258 --> 16:39.279
and the postmaster general

16:39.280 --> 16:41.687
would agree is actually your fault?!

16:47.556 --> 16:49.133
Well, now that I think about it,

16:49.582 --> 16:50.967
her number is still in my phone.

16:55.279 --> 16:56.361
<i>(Rapid knock on door)</i>

16:58.019 --> 16:59.659
Oh, I wonder who that could be.

16:59.660 --> 17:01.826
Are you gentlemen expecting anyone?

17:01.827 --> 17:02.852
(Clears throat)

17:03.353 --> 17:04.978
(Flatly) I know I am not.

17:08.087 --> 17:09.672
Nor am I.

17:14.132 --> 17:16.273
Riley, what are you doing
here? Where's Gretchen?

17:16.275 --> 17:18.838
Turns out the number I had
was from a stolen phone.

17:19.952 --> 17:22.055
But don't worry. I got this.

17:22.877 --> 17:25.714
(Loudly) Shut up, Wheeler,
and let me see my baby.

17:25.715 --> 17:27.066
Mama's home!

17:27.573 --> 17:30.341
Yo, who's the wigstand?

17:31.956 --> 17:34.024
Better question: Who's this?

17:34.025 --> 17:35.992
That's Gretchen, Emma's mom.

17:35.993 --> 17:38.662
Yeah. Yeah, she's been away
for like the last six months.

17:39.196 --> 17:42.737
Supposed to be nine but,
you know, good behavior.

17:45.687 --> 17:48.601
And how about you get your feet

17:48.602 --> 17:50.239
off my coffee table?

17:53.589 --> 17:56.300
I didn't steal it for you to ruin.

17:58.587 --> 18:01.357
And this is Bailey. She's a... a friend.

18:01.358 --> 18:03.573
(Laughs) Oh, I am a lot more than a friend.

18:03.574 --> 18:06.238
Well, you're not anymore,
'cause now that I'm out,

18:06.239 --> 18:08.429
I am back with my man.

18:08.430 --> 18:09.866
And I'm warning you...

18:09.867 --> 18:11.501
don't get in my way.

18:16.385 --> 18:18.591
- Was that a threat?
- Yes.

18:18.956 --> 18:20.600
Yeah, I believe it was.

18:20.601 --> 18:24.435
One... that I would take very seriously.

18:25.376 --> 18:27.036
And if I ever...

18:27.037 --> 18:28.416
See you round here again,

18:28.417 --> 18:30.684
well, I'm gonna do some bad things,

18:30.685 --> 18:33.828
some very bad things.

18:34.632 --> 18:38.052
(Angrily) Oh yeah? Like what?

18:38.504 --> 18:41.195
Things... that are bad.

18:42.394 --> 18:44.079
Okay, I fixed everything.

18:44.080 --> 18:47.010
Mom, look out. It's
Ben's baby mama, Gretchen,

18:47.011 --> 18:49.446
- and she's back from prison.
- Yeah. Yeah, watch out,

18:50.036 --> 18:51.750
or she will cut you.

18:54.165 --> 18:56.479
With what, her sharp wit?

18:56.480 --> 18:58.404
(Laughs) Yeah, I think I'm good.

18:59.182 --> 19:01.935
And you, listen up, you little sea monkey.

19:01.936 --> 19:03.497
No, you all listen.

19:04.576 --> 19:06.338
Look, Ben, I know what you're doing.

19:06.339 --> 19:09.056
You could've just broken up
with me like a normal person.

19:09.057 --> 19:10.338
Actually, I couldn't.

19:10.339 --> 19:12.590
I tried, like, a gabillion times.

19:12.591 --> 19:14.116
Well, I can take a hint.

19:14.117 --> 19:15.850
Again, I tried.

19:16.170 --> 19:18.592
But don't think I'm leaving quietly.

19:18.593 --> 19:21.292
I am going to sue you so hard

19:21.293 --> 19:22.957
you're all gonna feel it!

19:25.255 --> 19:26.354
And to think...

19:26.704 --> 19:29.390
I was gonna make you marry me!

19:33.592 --> 19:37.252
God. You gotta love her spunk, huh?

19:37.722 --> 19:39.492
Mom, you ruined everything!

19:39.493 --> 19:41.248
Riley was about to scare her off!

19:41.249 --> 19:44.796
Really? 'Cause I didn't
think it was going that well.

19:46.317 --> 19:47.659
(Scoffs) Are you kidding me?

19:47.660 --> 19:49.504
Girl, I thought you nailed it.

19:50.805 --> 19:53.793
Right, because Riley is so scary!

19:53.794 --> 19:55.338
Oh, come on! You can't
jump all over it like...

19:55.339 --> 19:59.215
- oh, is this about Adele?!
- For the love of God, focus! Huh?!

20:00.894 --> 20:04.278
- What are we gonna do?!
- Okay, just calm down.

20:04.279 --> 20:07.208
I said I was gonna fix it, and I did.

20:07.715 --> 20:09.269
If there's no car,

20:09.866 --> 20:11.662
there's no crime.

20:13.549 --> 20:16.773
Wait, what do you mean,
"if there's no car"?

20:19.250 --> 20:21.922
It's more of a coffee table now.

20:21.923 --> 20:24.789
Damn. My sunglasses were in there.

20:25.555 --> 20:27.388
What am I supposed to tell dad now?

20:27.389 --> 20:29.397
I'm almost positive he's gonna notice this.

20:29.398 --> 20:31.783
(Laughs) Oh, he definitely will.

20:31.784 --> 20:34.226
Here, quick, take a picture. Okay.

20:35.094 --> 20:37.061
- Ah!
- (Phone camera clicking)

20:37.062 --> 20:38.990
All right, take a bunch.
I want to make a calendar.

20:40.644 --> 20:42.036
Ooh. Ooh!

20:42.037 --> 20:43.382
I'm sorry, Ray.

20:43.383 --> 20:45.675
Adele got a little Fender bender.

20:45.676 --> 20:46.978
My bad.

20:48.560 --> 20:49.523
9?

20:50.513 --> 20:51.932
9?

20:52.269 --> 20:54.049
Come on, mama needs a 9!

20:54.050 --> 20:55.037
(Clears throat)

20:55.415 --> 20:57.598
Oh, whoa. Nice tan, buddy.

20:57.599 --> 20:59.009
Call me when you get a job.

21:01.486 --> 21:04.564
10? 10?

21:04.565 --> 21:06.451
Where is my perfect 10?

21:10.749 --> 21:12.359
Well, hello.
