WEBVTT

00:04.153 --> 00:05.487
Explain yourself.

00:05.571 --> 00:07.605
I'm taking photos of your feet
for perverts.

00:07.673 --> 00:09.040
Ew!
Hear me out.

00:09.107 --> 00:10.992
Remember when you
couldn't return those
sneakers you bought

00:11.060 --> 00:12.910
and asked me
to sell them online?

00:12.978 --> 00:14.929
Right after
I listed them...

00:14.997 --> 00:15.863
...I got a message asking

00:15.931 --> 00:17.332
if they'd been worn
and sweat in.

00:17.450 --> 00:18.783
Before I could lie
and say no...

00:18.851 --> 00:20.669
...I got
another message.

00:20.736 --> 00:22.637
"Can I see your feet?"

00:22.704 --> 00:24.756
Apparently, there are
a ton of these feet freaks

00:24.823 --> 00:26.091
on the Internet.

00:26.158 --> 00:27.759
Oh, my God,
did you write this?

00:27.827 --> 00:29.777
"My little piggies
got so sweaty."

00:29.845 --> 00:31.212
Sexy, right?
No.

00:31.263 --> 00:32.731
No, it's gross!

00:32.798 --> 00:35.684
That pair of sneakers
went for over $200.

00:35.751 --> 00:37.752
I have more in my closet.

00:37.819 --> 00:38.769
That was three weeks ago,

00:38.837 --> 00:40.355
and we have made
a ton of money since.

00:40.422 --> 00:43.357
All I have to do is wear
a different shoe every day.

00:45.344 --> 00:47.095
Hitting all of
the right notes...

00:47.163 --> 00:48.779
Ship it.

01:00.894 --> 01:02.727
Les finalistes

01:02.795 --> 01:07.832
pour L'Expo Internationale
du Closet sont...

01:07.900 --> 01:10.768
Kabinett Konig, Berlin.

01:10.836 --> 01:12.186
Pritchett's Closets --

01:12.254 --> 01:13.371
Hah! Yes!

01:13.438 --> 01:15.640
Aah!
Yes, yes, yes!

01:15.691 --> 01:16.874
Yes!

01:16.942 --> 01:19.677
You guys are so gross!

01:19.745 --> 01:21.897
For the first time
in company history,

01:21.964 --> 01:23.014
we are going to

01:23.032 --> 01:25.400
the Expo Internationale
du Closet!

01:26.585 --> 01:27.569
...Berlin.

01:27.636 --> 01:28.803
Pritchett's Closets.

01:28.871 --> 01:31.022
Son of a bitch,
we did it!

01:31.090 --> 01:31.772
We did it!

01:31.908 --> 01:33.124
Manny, I appreciate

01:33.192 --> 01:34.976
you coming from college
for this moment.

01:35.043 --> 01:37.311
Yeah...something like this
only happens

01:37.379 --> 01:39.764
once in a wee-- year --
lifetime?

01:39.832 --> 01:41.182
If that!

01:41.250 --> 01:42.683
I'm accustomed
to certain creature comforts

01:42.751 --> 01:44.118
that are hard to come by
at school,

01:44.220 --> 01:47.672
so I've been stopping home
to...borrow things.

01:47.740 --> 01:49.591
You know,
I may have to go shopping.

01:49.658 --> 01:52.193
I'm kind of between tuxedos,
size-wise, right now.

01:52.260 --> 01:55.263
Oh, so this is a...
big deal?
It is.

01:55.331 --> 01:58.015
But, uh, don't feel you have
to live up to this.

01:58.083 --> 02:00.101
because that kind of pressure
can kill a kid.

02:01.303 --> 02:02.587
That's probably
Claire calling me.

02:02.655 --> 02:04.739
These will be rolling in
all day, you know.

02:04.807 --> 02:05.990
Hello?

02:07.393 --> 02:09.060
Who still uses
fax machines?

02:09.127 --> 02:10.276
You know what?

02:10.279 --> 02:11.780
People are gonna
want to see me
at the office.

02:11.847 --> 02:14.148
I'll just play nine holes
and head in early, huh?

02:14.216 --> 02:15.817
See you, kid!
See you.

02:16.769 --> 02:17.819
My new real-estate company

02:17.886 --> 02:19.504
is this close
to its first sale.

02:19.572 --> 02:20.772
A sale we really need!

02:20.840 --> 02:22.106
Not just to prove
my old partners wrong,

02:22.174 --> 02:24.376
but also to pay the bills.

02:24.443 --> 02:28.062
Unfortunately, my client has
developed a case of cold feet.

02:28.130 --> 02:31.165
Phil, this house
is everything I have wanted.

02:31.233 --> 02:32.483
Great! Should we
write up an offer?

02:32.551 --> 02:36.738
But I am feeling
a hostile energy.

02:36.806 --> 02:38.022
I can assure you --
this house is filled

02:38.090 --> 02:39.607
with nothing
but happy memories.

02:39.675 --> 02:42.243
If these walls
could talk --
They can.

02:42.311 --> 02:44.111
And they are.

02:44.179 --> 02:45.397
Personally,
I don't believe in

02:45.464 --> 02:47.047
any of that
evil-spirit mumbo jumbo.

02:47.115 --> 02:49.317
As a magician, I've learned
that every spooky happening

02:49.384 --> 02:51.435
has a perfectly reasonable
explanation.

02:51.503 --> 02:53.988
Even the eeriest of illusions,
Satan's Elevator,

02:54.056 --> 02:57.158
is really just
two mirrors and a tiny...

02:57.743 --> 02:58.993
Nice try.

02:59.060 --> 03:00.678
When Phil told me
about this house,

03:00.746 --> 03:01.746
I offered to help.

03:01.814 --> 03:03.364
Now that
Manny's away at college

03:03.432 --> 03:05.050
and Joe
goes to kindergarten,

03:05.117 --> 03:07.418
I have time for
one of my old hobbies --

03:07.486 --> 03:10.121
confronting the devil
in all his forms.

03:10.188 --> 03:11.539
I have everything I need --

03:11.624 --> 03:15.359
sage, a spoon from
the Vatican cafeteria,

03:15.427 --> 03:16.844
my maracas --

03:16.912 --> 03:19.297
Oh, here she is!
Mrs. Graham, looking well!

03:19.364 --> 03:20.849
How are those peptides
doing?

03:20.916 --> 03:23.000
Ooh, terrific!
My shaman realigned them.

03:23.068 --> 03:24.269
And I got
the last everything bagel,

03:24.336 --> 03:26.605
so I guess we both got off
to a great start today.

03:26.672 --> 03:28.656
What say we buy a house?

03:28.724 --> 03:29.857
Oh, this is Gloria.

03:29.925 --> 03:31.326
She'll be addressing
your concerns.

03:31.393 --> 03:32.760
Nice to meet you.

03:32.828 --> 03:34.579
I instantly trust you.

03:34.647 --> 03:36.364
Why is that?

03:36.432 --> 03:38.299
Oh, I got it.

03:38.367 --> 03:41.252
We were once cats
together.

03:41.320 --> 03:43.204
I joke!
I'm not that crazy.

03:44.323 --> 03:45.240
Now, tell me
about the ghost.

03:45.307 --> 03:47.041
Well,
in these suburban cases,

03:47.109 --> 03:49.026
it's usually
a low-level haunting,

03:49.094 --> 03:51.629
like
a dead unpaid gardener,

03:51.697 --> 03:53.164
a dead jealous boyfriend,

03:53.232 --> 03:56.301
a dead dog who left
something unfetched.

03:57.519 --> 03:59.638
Okay. Here we go.

04:01.357 --> 04:02.389
Oh, she's just taken with

04:02.457 --> 04:03.691
the natural light
and the flow

04:03.759 --> 04:04.759
at this price.

04:04.826 --> 04:05.994
It -- It still gets me
every time.

04:06.062 --> 04:08.429
Hey!

04:10.015 --> 04:11.616
You did it,
you bastard!

04:11.684 --> 04:13.368
Be the change

04:13.435 --> 04:15.286
you want
to see in the world --

04:15.354 --> 04:16.821
I got here
as soon as I could!
Shh!

04:16.887 --> 04:18.572
In some ways,
the words of Gandhi

04:18.640 --> 04:20.408
are truer today
than ever before.

04:20.492 --> 04:24.429
The world is taking notice
of the Aurora walk-in,

04:24.496 --> 04:29.133
which is blurring the line
between storage and sanctuary.

04:32.638 --> 04:35.507
I want to take a moment
to celebrate our rock,

04:35.574 --> 04:37.208
our foundation,

04:37.275 --> 04:40.294
someone to whom
we owe a very special debt...

04:41.296 --> 04:42.463
Josie.

04:44.616 --> 04:46.267
Rock? Foundation?

04:46.334 --> 04:47.335
Josie?

04:47.402 --> 04:48.770
Who is that?!

04:48.838 --> 04:50.188
And to thank you all

04:50.256 --> 04:51.472
for your amazing
accomplishments,

04:51.540 --> 04:54.558
I have got an ice-cream cart
coming in this afternoon!

04:56.428 --> 04:57.612
That's right.

04:57.680 --> 04:58.913
I.T. guy,
I need your help.

04:58.981 --> 05:00.799
Cigar ash
in your keyboard again?
Something bigger.

05:00.866 --> 05:03.301
But, yeah,
bring that little vacuum.

05:03.368 --> 05:04.985
My sister Pam
came to stay with us

05:05.053 --> 05:06.771
for a couple weeks.
A year ago.

05:06.839 --> 05:07.872
In the unit upstairs --

05:07.939 --> 05:09.507
which we used to rent
for money,

05:09.574 --> 05:10.575
which we need

05:10.642 --> 05:12.710
to pay for everybody
in the unit downstairs.

05:12.778 --> 05:13.812
We had no choice.

05:13.879 --> 05:14.879
She was pregnant.

05:14.946 --> 05:16.514
The father, Bo,
was in jail,

05:16.581 --> 05:18.683
and she happens to be
my best friend.

05:18.751 --> 05:21.986
Yeah, yeah, like Tom and Jerry
ae best friends.

05:22.054 --> 05:25.273
Pam, did you remember
the oranges?

05:25.341 --> 05:28.642
Say "oranges"
one more time.

05:28.710 --> 05:30.061
Oranges.

05:31.129 --> 05:33.180
Say it one more time!

05:33.248 --> 05:34.932
And then
she left the door open,

05:35.000 --> 05:36.300
and poor Larry got out

05:36.368 --> 05:38.185
and got in a fight
with a possum.
Ohh.

05:38.270 --> 05:40.355
Now we have to give him
antibiotics every day at noon,

05:40.422 --> 05:41.656
which he hates.

05:41.723 --> 05:42.607
On the positive side,

05:42.674 --> 05:43.875
we've both been
coming home at lunch

05:43.943 --> 05:45.260
because
it's a two-man job,

05:45.327 --> 05:46.961
as is what
we've also been enjoying

05:47.029 --> 05:48.596
on our little
lunch break...

05:48.664 --> 05:50.531
You look really cute
in that suit.

05:50.599 --> 05:53.351
You look really cute
in those gym shorts.

05:54.820 --> 05:57.138
Only eight more days
of cat antibiotics.

05:57.206 --> 05:58.789
Say "antibiotics"
one more time.

05:58.857 --> 06:00.992
Antibiotics.

06:01.060 --> 06:02.276
Okay, sweetie,

06:02.344 --> 06:04.378
but Pam's Mommy and Me class
is only an hour,

06:04.446 --> 06:06.514
so, you know, hurry.

06:06.581 --> 06:08.332
Oh, a surprise, huh?

06:08.400 --> 06:10.852
Okay.
Okay, well I can't wait.

06:13.238 --> 06:14.272
Yeah?

06:14.339 --> 06:15.589
Afternoon.

06:15.657 --> 06:16.958
Oh, my God,
are you the surprise?

06:17.025 --> 06:18.893
Um, I was thinking candles,
or flowers on the bed --

06:18.960 --> 06:19.994
My name is Bo Johnson,

06:20.062 --> 06:21.395
and I am here
to meet my baby boy

06:21.463 --> 06:22.997
and win back
the love of my life,

06:23.065 --> 06:24.515
Miss Pam Tucker.

06:24.583 --> 06:26.518
Oh, my -- You're --
You're B-- You are Bo.

06:26.585 --> 06:28.353
Um, okay, well,
Pam is not here.

06:28.420 --> 06:30.338
Uh, I'm Mitchell,
Cameron's husband.

06:30.406 --> 06:31.572
He's talked so much
about you.

06:31.574 --> 06:32.606
Oh, well,

06:32.674 --> 06:34.108
he did have
a little thing for me

06:34.176 --> 06:35.409
back in high school.
Yeah.

06:35.477 --> 06:37.128
I guess he's got a type.

06:37.195 --> 06:38.313
Stop it! Stop it.

06:38.380 --> 06:40.164
I am nothing like --
Well, if you don't mind,
actually,

06:40.231 --> 06:41.098
I'd like to come in?

06:41.166 --> 06:43.867
Uh, I got to see man
about a horse.

06:43.935 --> 06:45.185
But we don't have --

06:45.253 --> 06:46.270
That's a classy way
of saying

06:46.338 --> 06:47.788
I got to make my bladder
gladder.

06:47.856 --> 06:49.007
Bathroom!
Uh, yes...

06:49.074 --> 06:51.058
Uh, end of the hall
on -- on the right. Yep.

06:51.126 --> 06:52.777
Oh, and the Teen Vogues
are our daughter's!

06:52.845 --> 06:56.063
We don't even know
who Demi Lovato is!

06:56.131 --> 06:57.665
Okay, how did Larry
get out again?

06:57.732 --> 06:59.784
God, it must've been
your sister.

06:59.852 --> 07:01.819
So, guess who is
in the bathroom.

07:01.886 --> 07:03.321
Oh, well, my surprise
was just candles,

07:03.388 --> 07:04.605
but I'm not saying no.

07:04.673 --> 07:06.491
No, uh...it's Bo.

07:06.558 --> 07:07.542
My Bo?
No --

07:07.609 --> 07:09.410
Well, technically, he's --
he's more Pam's Bo,

07:09.478 --> 07:10.945
and I am your Mitchell,
but yes.

07:11.013 --> 07:13.414
Yeah, he's here to take Pam
and the baby home!

07:13.482 --> 07:15.333
I mean,
how great is that?

07:15.401 --> 07:16.550
Cameron Tucker!

07:16.618 --> 07:18.703
Get the hell
out of my house.

07:18.770 --> 07:19.804
Close those arms.

07:19.872 --> 07:20.871
Come on, Cam.

07:20.939 --> 07:22.940
Yeah, come on, Cam.
No.

07:23.008 --> 07:25.893
You are not getting
anywhere near my sister.

07:25.961 --> 07:27.595
Now get out!

07:28.247 --> 07:29.613
Hmm?

07:29.681 --> 07:30.682
Let's go! Get out!

07:30.749 --> 07:32.349
Uh, won't he just
wait for Pam outside?

07:32.685 --> 07:34.118
I mean --
Okay, you know...
come back in!

07:34.185 --> 07:36.437
Great.
There goes Larry again.

07:36.504 --> 07:39.690
You know,
I'm starting to think
he's unhappy living here.

07:41.693 --> 07:44.028
Good. Good.

07:44.096 --> 07:45.780
Uh, no Velcro.

07:45.865 --> 07:48.332
Our brand
is a little more upscale.

07:49.618 --> 07:50.818
Uh-oh.

07:50.886 --> 07:53.637
Another buyer is tired
of seeing the same feet.

07:53.705 --> 07:54.922
Oh, it's my fault now?

07:54.990 --> 07:57.542
What's he doing to keep things
iteresting?

07:57.609 --> 07:59.977
Why do I care?

08:00.045 --> 08:01.729
I'm surprised
you were open to this.

08:01.797 --> 08:03.364
I'm surprised
you know how to do this.

08:03.432 --> 08:04.882
Don't forget,
we have to get over

08:04.950 --> 08:06.801
to mom's work
to ship shoes later.

08:06.868 --> 08:08.853
Wait a second,
you're using Mom's FedEx?

08:08.921 --> 08:11.039
Every time she and Dad
have a fancy night out,

08:11.106 --> 08:13.223
she uses the hashtag
"Luke's college fund."

08:13.275 --> 08:15.392
So, yeah,
I'm using her account.

08:17.830 --> 08:18.880
Is there something

08:18.947 --> 08:20.448
you're not telling me
about this house?

08:20.515 --> 08:22.349
I am kind of getting
a murdery vibe.

08:22.417 --> 08:24.201
The only killing
that's ever gonna
happen in this house

08:24.269 --> 08:26.187
is the one that's gonna happen
when you sell the place.

08:27.389 --> 08:29.490
Laughter makes
the spirits hungry, Phil!

08:29.557 --> 08:30.624
Spirits?

08:30.692 --> 08:31.692
You means
there's more than one?

08:31.760 --> 08:32.860
Oh.

08:32.928 --> 08:33.962
Hi, Gil.

08:34.029 --> 08:35.813
Wait. No. Uh, Gil?

08:35.880 --> 08:37.515
Hey, Glo?

08:37.582 --> 08:39.467
Um...

08:39.534 --> 08:41.034
Uh, super stoked
you're here.

08:41.102 --> 08:43.037
If -- If I could give you
one tiny note?

08:43.105 --> 08:45.473
Mrs. Graham's terror level,
which should be going down,

08:45.541 --> 08:47.275
is actually going up.
Mine too.

08:47.342 --> 08:49.410
Actually,
I'm panicking right now!

08:49.478 --> 08:51.712
I can't believe
what I'm sensing right now!

08:51.780 --> 08:55.900
There is like,
a humming sound,
vibrations, fear!

08:55.968 --> 08:57.435
I'm pretty sure that's all
coming off of me,

08:57.503 --> 08:59.086
because I'm about to lose
a sale I really need.

08:59.154 --> 09:01.522
How about this?
Just -- Just spin it a little.

09:01.589 --> 09:03.340
What are you asking me
to do?

09:03.408 --> 09:05.559
In real estate,
there are no dumps.

09:05.644 --> 09:06.927
There are fixer-uppers.

09:06.995 --> 09:08.862
A small house is cozy.

09:08.930 --> 09:10.047
How do we know
this presence is bad?

09:10.115 --> 09:11.532
What about Casper?
Or the Holy Ghost?

09:11.600 --> 09:12.599
People love those guys --

09:12.667 --> 09:13.901
Phil.
Hey!

09:13.968 --> 09:15.336
It's bad, isn't it?

09:15.403 --> 09:17.271
No, it's -- it's actually
really good.

09:17.339 --> 09:19.706
Um, Gloria was just saying
she's making real progress.

09:19.774 --> 09:21.142
Right, Gloria?
I'm sorry,

09:21.209 --> 09:23.094
but there is a disturbing
presence in this house

09:23.161 --> 09:25.079
that I don't think
that I can drive out.

09:25.146 --> 09:26.931
Well,
that is it for me.

09:26.999 --> 09:28.266
Phil, please let me know

09:28.333 --> 09:29.783
if you find something
less haunted,

09:29.851 --> 09:32.603
still within walking distance
to my psychic.

09:34.322 --> 09:36.541
We'll be right back.
Bo, you want some iced tea?

09:36.591 --> 09:37.675
That'd be great.
Thank you.

09:37.743 --> 09:39.259
No, you are not
giving him iced tea.

09:39.344 --> 09:41.045
This is not
a garden party.

09:41.112 --> 09:42.729
But he did come all this way
to make things right.

09:42.797 --> 09:43.797
And you know what, Cam?

09:43.865 --> 09:45.482
Prison changes people.
Oh, does it?

09:45.550 --> 09:48.252
Always. In a good
and permanent way.

09:48.353 --> 09:49.186
Ohh.
I mean, look at him...

09:49.254 --> 09:51.455
No.
Do not look at him.

09:51.523 --> 09:52.589
He is a siren.

09:52.657 --> 09:54.308
He draws you in with those
big beautiful blue eyes,

09:54.376 --> 09:56.127
and the next thing you know,
you're giving him

09:56.194 --> 09:57.745
your great-grandfather's
Civil War bayonet

09:57.812 --> 10:00.414
and he's selling it
for Magic Beans.

10:00.482 --> 10:02.033
It's the brand of whiskey
he drinks.

10:02.084 --> 10:05.202
I just -- I think he deserves
a second chance.

10:05.270 --> 10:06.320
Why do you suddenly
care so much

10:06.388 --> 10:07.855
if Pam and Bo
are back together?

10:07.923 --> 10:09.373
I'm a divorce lawyer, Cam.

10:09.441 --> 10:11.575
I see families torn apart
all the time.

10:11.643 --> 10:14.746
The emotional cost
is just too high.
Oh.

10:14.813 --> 10:16.613
The cost of everything
is too high!

10:16.681 --> 10:17.765
Look, Pam made her bed.

10:17.832 --> 10:19.416
Now she needs to get out of it

10:19.484 --> 10:22.570
so I can flip the mattress
and make some money off of it.

10:22.655 --> 10:24.938
Sounded more pimpy
than I intended.

10:25.023 --> 10:26.107
Mm.

10:26.175 --> 10:28.459
Maybe Pam doesn't want
to live upstairs anymore.

10:28.526 --> 10:30.745
Maybe she wants to go with him
to Missouri.

10:30.812 --> 10:33.447
Or maybe you don't want Pam
to live upstairs

10:33.515 --> 10:35.016
and you want her
to go home to Missouri.

10:35.083 --> 10:36.150
I couldn't help
but overhear,

10:36.217 --> 10:37.618
since we're practically
in the same room

10:37.686 --> 10:39.052
and you ain't exactly
whispering...

10:39.120 --> 10:40.455
Can I say something
on my behalf?

10:40.522 --> 10:41.806
No, you may not!

10:41.873 --> 10:43.291
Because if you cared
about my sister,

10:43.358 --> 10:45.442
you would've been here the
moment baby Calhoun was born!

10:45.510 --> 10:46.661
I know,
but when I got out of jail

10:46.728 --> 10:47.995
for punching
that police horse,

10:48.080 --> 10:49.346
I discovered my truck
had been towed.

10:49.414 --> 10:51.832
I had to sell my plasma
for cash.

10:51.900 --> 10:53.517
He thinks of others.
Very noble.

10:53.585 --> 10:55.686
All I'm hearing is
no car, no money,

10:55.754 --> 10:57.338
compromised immune system.

10:57.406 --> 10:58.422
What a great role model.

10:58.590 --> 10:59.607
And yes,
he could be a model,

10:59.674 --> 11:01.175
but I will not
be distracted

11:01.243 --> 11:03.143
by those beautiful
big blue eyes.

11:03.211 --> 11:04.729
Cam, I get it,
all right?

11:04.797 --> 11:06.163
I made a lot of mistakes.

11:06.231 --> 11:07.398
But like my plasma,

11:07.465 --> 11:10.034
I decided to "B-positive."

11:10.102 --> 11:12.670
I hitchhiked,
I took odd jobs,

11:12.738 --> 11:14.104
whatever I could do
to get here.

11:14.172 --> 11:15.823
I mean, Pam,
our boy Calhoun --

11:15.891 --> 11:17.491
They're my family.

11:17.559 --> 11:21.212
Hell, you're my family.

11:21.279 --> 11:22.413
Look, I-I want
to believe you, Bo,

11:22.480 --> 11:23.514
but, yeah, I just --

11:23.582 --> 11:25.016
I've been burned
too many times.

11:25.083 --> 11:27.084
About that...
I got something to show you.

11:32.007 --> 11:33.424
Old Stonewall Tucker

11:33.491 --> 11:35.760
would've wanted you
to have this back.

11:35.827 --> 11:37.044
Oh, Stonewall.

11:37.112 --> 11:38.429
I'm guessing his statue's
no longer in the park.

11:38.497 --> 11:41.215
I thought you sold this.
Welp, that was the old Bo.

11:41.283 --> 11:44.068
The new Bo saved up
and bought it back for you.

11:44.136 --> 11:45.119
See?
Believe me,

11:45.186 --> 11:47.821
I'm trying to do
the right thing.

11:47.889 --> 11:50.441
Hey...
Oh, Bo...

11:51.460 --> 11:53.461
What the hell
is he doing here?!

11:53.528 --> 11:56.147
Now, Pameron, Bo came back
for you and baby Calhoun!

11:56.215 --> 11:57.865
Yeah, just -- just give him
a chance, okay?

11:57.933 --> 12:00.684
Oh, my gosh.
I-Is this him?

12:00.752 --> 12:02.269
Is -- Is that my boy?

12:02.337 --> 12:03.187
No. This is my car,

12:03.255 --> 12:04.705
and I have
a little tiny driver.

12:04.773 --> 12:05.772
Of course it's him!

12:05.840 --> 12:06.924
You stay away from us,

12:06.992 --> 12:09.076
Beauregard
Lavern Johnson!
Come on --

12:09.144 --> 12:11.412
And stop undressing me
with your devil blue eyes!

12:11.480 --> 12:13.263
Okay, You know what?
I'll -- I'll go --

12:13.331 --> 12:14.632
I'll go talk to her.

12:16.501 --> 12:18.535
Oof. Hey, thank you
for pleading my case

12:18.603 --> 12:20.137
back there with Cam.

12:20.205 --> 12:21.939
I can tell,
you're good lawyer.

12:22.007 --> 12:24.025
And I can tell
you are a good man.

12:24.092 --> 12:25.392
I am team Bo all the way.

12:25.460 --> 12:26.743
All right, good.

12:26.811 --> 12:28.462
'Cause I-I might need
some legal counsel.

12:28.530 --> 12:30.564
See, I-I didn't buy
that bayonet back

12:30.632 --> 12:32.132
so much as I stole it.

12:32.200 --> 12:33.583
Oh, dear.

12:36.037 --> 12:37.804
Excuse me, everyone!

12:38.190 --> 12:39.039
As founder of this company,

12:39.107 --> 12:41.908
which I built
with my own sweat and tears,

12:41.976 --> 12:43.593
I'd like to say a few words.

12:43.661 --> 12:44.628
Before going into the future,

12:44.696 --> 12:46.713
it's important we honor
how we got here.

12:46.781 --> 12:48.332
So I put together
a little presentation.

12:48.399 --> 12:50.534
Dad,
we're having ice cream.

12:50.602 --> 12:51.652
They can lick and watch.

12:51.720 --> 12:53.904
Ponytail, lights.

12:58.126 --> 13:00.310
1946.

13:00.378 --> 13:03.313
An iron curtain
was descending over Europe.

13:03.381 --> 13:06.334
But in Youngstown, Ohio,
a child is born.

13:06.401 --> 13:09.953
While young Jay Pritchett
was a superstar athlete,

13:10.021 --> 13:11.088
he was also an artist

13:11.156 --> 13:14.274
who dreamed of revolutionizing
an industry --

13:14.342 --> 13:15.476
closets.

13:15.543 --> 13:17.128
He just couldn't
let me have my day.

13:17.196 --> 13:18.812
He had to make it
all about him.

13:18.880 --> 13:20.898
It was disgusting.

13:20.965 --> 13:21.982
Although...

13:22.050 --> 13:23.818
the scene of him
playing his father

13:23.885 --> 13:25.352
denying him
a startup loan?

13:25.420 --> 13:27.939
Surprisingly powerful.

13:28.006 --> 13:30.190
While America
was doing the Hustle,

13:30.258 --> 13:31.892
Jay as hustling
to build an empire,

13:31.960 --> 13:34.145
which is why one newspaper
called him

13:34.213 --> 13:36.930
"the hardest working man
in closets."

13:36.998 --> 13:38.799
That was an ad.

13:38.866 --> 13:40.350
Who would've thought
the company,

13:40.418 --> 13:41.502
built by that little boy,

13:41.570 --> 13:43.153
would one day be the toast

13:43.221 --> 13:45.672
of the international
closet world?

13:45.740 --> 13:49.093
Congratulations.
We did it.

13:50.829 --> 13:52.563
Margaret's
mixing some drinks.

13:54.383 --> 13:55.766
Enjoy the afternoon.

13:55.833 --> 13:57.200
Nice!
Thank you.

14:01.356 --> 14:02.957
Okay, Mrs. Graham's car
is on its way!

14:03.024 --> 14:04.842
You have five minutes
to convince her

14:04.909 --> 14:06.210
that this house is fine!

14:06.278 --> 14:07.694
Feel this wall,
Phil.

14:07.762 --> 14:09.563
No, I am done
with this nonsense!

14:09.631 --> 14:10.665
I can't believe
I'm hearing this

14:10.732 --> 14:12.199
from a person
that believes in magic!

14:12.267 --> 14:13.834
I'm not the one
who told you this,

14:13.901 --> 14:15.486
but magic
isn't actually magic.

14:15.554 --> 14:17.705
That didn't
come from your ear.

14:17.772 --> 14:19.506
What? How?

14:20.992 --> 14:21.842
You're with them.

14:21.909 --> 14:23.277
There is no "them," Gloria.

14:23.345 --> 14:25.879
Everybody says "What? How?"
to that trick.

14:25.964 --> 14:27.398
That's how magic works.

14:27.465 --> 14:28.416
Things that seem supernatural

14:28.483 --> 14:30.318
actually have a perfectly
logical explanation.

14:30.385 --> 14:31.918
This wall is warm, Phil.

14:31.986 --> 14:33.604
It's radiating evil.

14:33.672 --> 14:35.005
It is not radiating evil --

14:35.073 --> 14:37.742
Oh, that is warm.
Oh!

14:37.809 --> 14:38.609
What was that?

14:38.777 --> 14:40.861
Faulty wiring, Phil?!
How dare you.

14:40.929 --> 14:43.163
I would never sell a house
with faulty wiring!

14:44.983 --> 14:45.983
You can hear that,
right?

14:46.051 --> 14:48.168
You made them angry.

14:48.253 --> 14:49.720
I don't believe in
any of this!

14:49.788 --> 14:51.906
But just in case...

14:51.973 --> 14:53.623
What is this?
Holy water?
No.

14:53.691 --> 14:54.892
Cucumber water.

14:55.010 --> 14:57.044
You think this skin
just happens?

14:57.128 --> 14:58.579
Okay...okay.

14:58.647 --> 15:00.180
The sellers
are on their way home.

15:00.248 --> 15:01.849
Let's just put everything back
the way we found it

15:01.916 --> 15:02.933
and maybe swing by a church.

15:03.001 --> 15:05.102
Come on!

15:05.921 --> 15:07.221
Ohh!

15:07.289 --> 15:08.439
Oh, my God!

15:08.507 --> 15:09.823
Bees!

15:09.891 --> 15:12.476
Oh! Go!
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

15:12.544 --> 15:15.128
Good news, Mrs. Graham,
it's only bees!

15:15.196 --> 15:17.047
I'll follow up
with the escrow documents!

15:17.115 --> 15:19.316
Congrats! Ow!

15:20.302 --> 15:23.453
Hey. So, that was
a fun movie, Dad.

15:23.521 --> 15:25.923
Kind of made it
all about you, though.

15:25.991 --> 15:28.125
Nonsense.
Try a Jay-tini.

15:28.192 --> 15:29.075
I'm good.

15:29.211 --> 15:30.962
Congratulations
on the Expo, boss.

15:31.029 --> 15:32.462
Thanks.
Thanks.

15:32.530 --> 15:34.114
I think that what's her name
was talking to me.

15:34.182 --> 15:35.649
Oh?

15:35.717 --> 15:38.469
Oh, Margaret,
what are my kids doing here?

15:38.553 --> 15:40.520
Oh, the kids have been using
the company shipping.

15:40.588 --> 15:42.789
They've been coming in
for weeks.

15:42.857 --> 15:44.258
I am so drunk.

15:44.326 --> 15:46.343
Am I screaming?

15:49.481 --> 15:50.898
What do you two
think you're doing?

15:50.965 --> 15:52.833
Oh, uh...we just came
to congratulate you

15:52.901 --> 15:54.351
on that thing
that happened.

15:54.419 --> 15:55.903
- Try again.
- Fine.

15:56.021 --> 15:57.538
But there's no nice way
to say this.

15:57.605 --> 15:58.772
I started a company

15:58.857 --> 16:00.358
selling Alex's disgusting,
smelly shoes

16:00.425 --> 16:01.675
to feet freaks.

16:01.743 --> 16:02.793
Wow, that is so gross!

16:02.861 --> 16:04.195
More like gutsy.

16:04.262 --> 16:05.529
You got to get
your hands dirty

16:05.580 --> 16:07.264
to build a company
from the ground up.

16:07.331 --> 16:08.799
I'm proud of you, Luke.

16:08.866 --> 16:10.016
Uh, hold on.

16:10.084 --> 16:11.952
It was my idea to start
buying thrift-store shoes.

16:12.020 --> 16:14.355
I expanded the business
and doubled our profits.

16:14.422 --> 16:15.672
You see what Alex did?

16:15.740 --> 16:16.974
She grew the business.

16:17.041 --> 16:18.359
She took it
to the next level.

16:18.426 --> 16:21.378
She was able to achieve
what Luke couldn't,

16:21.445 --> 16:22.913
despite years of trying.

16:22.964 --> 16:23.998
It's really
only been a few --

16:24.132 --> 16:25.499
You can't grow
what doesn't exist!

16:25.567 --> 16:26.734
Okay. Well, they're
on their thing now.

16:26.802 --> 16:28.001
Just walk away.

16:28.069 --> 16:30.153
Do you know how long
I've been with this company?

16:30.221 --> 16:31.371
Seven presidents.

16:31.439 --> 16:33.541
And four popes.
Yes, Dad, I saw the movie.

16:33.608 --> 16:35.609
Couldn't you just
let me have today?

16:35.676 --> 16:37.678
Why didn't you call me?
What are you talking about?

16:37.746 --> 16:39.045
This morning.
When you got the big news.

16:39.113 --> 16:40.630
I mean, am I not
a part of this anymore?

16:40.698 --> 16:41.982
Is that
what's going on here?

16:42.050 --> 16:43.401
I didn't call you
because I was waiting

16:43.468 --> 16:46.086
for you to call me and say,
"Congratulations!

16:46.154 --> 16:47.705
You did it, honey."

16:47.772 --> 16:48.756
Instead,
I had to come here

16:48.823 --> 16:50.474
and watch
"Lawrence of A-Jay-bia."

16:50.542 --> 16:53.160
How else would anybody know
I even existed?
What?

16:53.227 --> 16:55.479
I spent my entire career
trying to get in the Expo,

16:55.546 --> 16:57.414
and you come in
and get it done in 2 years.

16:57.482 --> 16:59.483
Come on,
it goes without saying

16:59.534 --> 17:02.286
that this company would be
nothing without you.

17:02.354 --> 17:03.704
No, it doesn't.
Hmm?

17:03.772 --> 17:05.156
Let me hear you say it.
Seriously?

17:05.223 --> 17:06.607
Yes. I want to hear it.

17:09.026 --> 17:11.111
Dad,
if it weren't for you,

17:11.179 --> 17:13.847
we wouldn't be
where we are today.

17:13.932 --> 17:15.332
All of your hard work

17:15.400 --> 17:18.301
laid the foundation
for our success.

17:19.837 --> 17:21.186
Now you.

17:21.255 --> 17:22.506
Well, if I say it,
it'll sound
a little conceited.

17:22.574 --> 17:25.858
No, not about you!
About me!

17:25.925 --> 17:27.578
It's...

17:27.646 --> 17:29.429
an unbelievable
accomplishment.

17:29.497 --> 17:31.248
You've exceeded
all my expectations,

17:31.316 --> 17:34.251
which were ridiculously high
to begin with.

17:34.319 --> 17:36.520
The company could not be
in better hands.

17:38.824 --> 17:40.458
Thanks, Dad.

17:41.693 --> 17:42.592
Okay,
let's just agree

17:42.660 --> 17:44.561
that your heart
was in the right place

17:44.629 --> 17:45.996
giving Cam back
his bayonet.

17:46.047 --> 17:48.549
But knowing
what a decent person you are,

17:48.616 --> 17:49.967
I'm sure
you're planning on --

17:50.035 --> 17:51.602
Bo, open this door!

17:52.771 --> 17:53.854
Bo!

17:53.922 --> 17:55.055
Bo --

17:55.122 --> 17:56.991
How long you expect me
to wait out there in the car?

17:57.058 --> 17:59.076
Oh, God, please tell me
this is your cab driver.

17:59.144 --> 18:00.093
I'm Heather.

18:00.161 --> 18:01.862
It's like feather,
but with an "H"?

18:01.930 --> 18:02.979
I'm familiar
with the name.

18:03.047 --> 18:04.932
Uh, I'll be right out,
sweetie.

18:04.999 --> 18:07.418
I'm just finishing up
with my client.

18:07.485 --> 18:09.169
Okay, Mr. Pringle,
you can expect delivery

18:09.237 --> 18:11.038
of one male
and one female chinchilla

18:11.106 --> 18:12.189
in the next...

18:12.257 --> 18:13.941
Phew.
Good. She's gone.

18:13.943 --> 18:15.892
Can you believe
I just thought of that

18:15.960 --> 18:17.077
on the spot?

18:17.144 --> 18:19.079
Mm.

18:19.147 --> 18:20.914
I'm not going down there,
Cam.

18:20.982 --> 18:22.532
I don't trust myself
around him.

18:22.600 --> 18:24.117
I see that face,
I hear that voice,

18:24.185 --> 18:25.369
I go all gooey.

18:25.436 --> 18:27.103
You're preaching to
the gay man's choir, here.

18:27.171 --> 18:28.722
But you have
to decide for yourself,

18:28.790 --> 18:30.090
and you need to keep
a clear head.

18:30.158 --> 18:31.408
You know what?
All right.

18:31.476 --> 18:32.793
So, here's a trick
that I used

18:32.861 --> 18:34.011
when I was coming of age.

18:34.078 --> 18:36.830
So, I had a little bit of
a self-control problem,

18:36.898 --> 18:38.365
and I would put a rubber band
around my wrist

18:38.432 --> 18:40.017
and flick it every time
I got the urge

18:40.084 --> 18:42.336
to...flick it.

18:42.403 --> 18:44.504
Ew! You used to snap
one of those like crazy

18:44.572 --> 18:46.272
whenever we watched
"Dukes of Hazzard."

18:46.340 --> 18:48.475
Yeah. I got through
all seven seasons --

18:48.543 --> 18:49.843
zero incidents.

18:51.663 --> 18:53.364
Okay.
Say your piece.

18:53.431 --> 18:54.532
But I'll tell you
right now,

18:54.599 --> 18:56.750
I ain't gonna
make it easy for you.

18:56.818 --> 18:59.769
You sure look pretty,
Pam'n'cheese.

19:01.489 --> 19:03.240
Oh, Bo...

19:03.308 --> 19:04.591
Come here.

19:04.659 --> 19:06.293
Mm!

19:06.378 --> 19:07.361
We did that.

19:07.429 --> 19:08.845
Yeah. Yeah, we did.

19:08.913 --> 19:10.580
I know
I don't deserve you...
No.

19:10.648 --> 19:12.599
...but if you and Cal
will have me,

19:12.667 --> 19:15.085
I promise to spend
every day of my life

19:15.153 --> 19:17.071
proving that I am worthy.

19:17.138 --> 19:19.022
Oh, my God!

19:19.090 --> 19:20.623
Look at
this beautiful ring!

19:20.775 --> 19:22.375
It's just so perfect --

19:22.443 --> 19:24.060
Who's Heather?

19:25.513 --> 19:26.497
Oh, that's the name

19:26.565 --> 19:27.981
of the jeweler
I bought it from.

19:28.049 --> 19:30.383
Heather's Rings and...
Things.

19:30.451 --> 19:32.168
Okay! Nope!
Mnh-mnh! Nope!

19:32.236 --> 19:34.020
No, even I can't
spin this anymore.

19:34.105 --> 19:35.639
All right.
Bo is a disaster, okay?

19:35.707 --> 19:37.590
He -- He hasn't changed
one bit.

19:37.658 --> 19:38.942
He is a liar,
he is a thief,

19:39.010 --> 19:40.611
he is a day drinker,
he --

19:40.678 --> 19:41.995
He stole that ring
from Heather,

19:42.080 --> 19:44.647
who's waiting outside for him
in case you say no.

19:44.715 --> 19:46.266
Hey!
You can't say any of that!

19:46.334 --> 19:48.635
That's attorney-client
privilege!

19:48.703 --> 19:49.686
He's also an idiot.

19:49.754 --> 19:51.704
Look, okay,
I am not letting you and Cal

19:51.789 --> 19:53.290
go anywhere near him,
all right?

19:53.357 --> 19:54.808
I cannot believe
I got drawn in

19:54.876 --> 19:57.093
by those big beautiful
blue eyes again.

19:57.095 --> 19:58.745
Get out of my house.

19:58.813 --> 20:01.197
Well, it's not really
up to you, now is it?

20:01.265 --> 20:03.950
What you think,
Pamburger?

20:04.018 --> 20:06.202
Well, I --

20:06.354 --> 20:07.721
Ow.

20:08.706 --> 20:12.125
Get the hell out!

20:12.193 --> 20:13.877
Fine.

20:13.945 --> 20:15.111
I'm glad I left
the air conditioning on

20:15.163 --> 20:16.313
for Heather.

20:20.451 --> 20:21.568
Oh --
Oh --

20:21.635 --> 20:22.702
I even got --

20:22.770 --> 20:24.371
Ow!

20:24.439 --> 20:25.555
Thanks, Mitchell...
Yeah.

20:25.623 --> 20:27.524
...for taking care of me
like that.
Hey, hey.

20:27.591 --> 20:28.826
You have a home here

20:28.893 --> 20:31.161
as long as you need it,
okay?
Aww, Mitchell,

20:31.228 --> 20:32.763
you really are looking out
for my sister.

20:32.931 --> 20:34.465
And you know what, Pam?

20:34.532 --> 20:35.699
As long as you're
gonna be staying here
for a little while,

20:35.767 --> 20:37.217
you got to mind the door
a little better.

20:37.284 --> 20:38.735
Larry keeps getting out.

20:38.803 --> 20:41.138
Say "Larry"
one more time.
Okay.

20:42.524 --> 20:44.775
Larry.

20:44.843 --> 20:46.493
I told you
not to say it!
Get off of me!

20:48.963 --> 20:50.330
Ah,
your mother called you

20:50.398 --> 20:52.416
about the screening
of my film.
Uh...

20:52.483 --> 20:53.784
She blew us off.

20:53.852 --> 20:55.786
Some lame excuse about
getting attacked by bees.

20:55.954 --> 20:57.538
Well, what the hell?
Let's start.

20:57.605 --> 20:59.122
19--

20:59.190 --> 21:01.041
What are you doing
over there?

21:01.109 --> 21:02.876
What are you doing
up there?

21:02.944 --> 21:05.862
Is that you
with Lady Bird Johnson?
Sure is.

21:05.930 --> 21:09.666
I was Closet Magazine's
"Movers and Groovers
to Watch."

21:09.734 --> 21:10.500
She did the keynote

21:10.668 --> 21:12.169
and complimented
my mustache.

21:12.236 --> 21:13.503
Heady times.

21:13.555 --> 21:15.439
What's with
all that news footage?

21:15.507 --> 21:17.457
Well, historical context
is important.

21:17.525 --> 21:20.127
Post-Watergate,
people wanted transparency.

21:20.194 --> 21:21.729
Hence the glass closet.

21:21.796 --> 21:24.447
Now, let me explain
why my shirt is off
in the next shot.
