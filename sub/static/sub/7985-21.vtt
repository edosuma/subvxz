00:01.971 --> 00:04.408
BRYAN: <i>Tonight, in their</i>
<i>final</i> Dance Moms <i>sit‐down,</i>

00:04.408 --> 00:05.845
<i>Maddie and Mackenzie are gonna</i>

00:05.845 --> 00:08.049
<i>relive their experience</i>
<i>from the beginning.</i>

00:08.049 --> 00:10.187
ABBY LEE:
<i>Look at that face!</i>

00:10.187 --> 00:11.757
Why did I not just
forget about Maddie

00:11.757 --> 00:14.897
and take you,
move to Hollywood,

00:14.897 --> 00:16.901
<i>and make you</i>
<i>the next actress star?</i>

00:16.901 --> 00:19.105
BRYAN:
<i>The good times,</i>

00:19.105 --> 00:20.608
<i>the not‐so‐good times...</i>

00:20.608 --> 00:22.478
You keep doing it wrong.

00:22.478 --> 00:24.315
You're wasting my time!

00:24.315 --> 00:25.284
BRYAN: <i>...the triumphs...</i>

00:25.284 --> 00:27.522
BOTH:
Abby Lee Dance Company!

00:27.522 --> 00:29.392
BRYAN: <i>...and the heartbreaks.</i>

00:29.392 --> 00:31.062
MADDIE: <i>No, Abby's gonna</i>
<i>freak out on me!</i>

00:31.062 --> 00:32.766
No, no, no!

00:32.766 --> 00:34.368
BRYAN: <i>Abby has been there</i>
<i>through it all,</i>

00:34.368 --> 00:37.174
<i>taking Maddie and Mackenzie</i>
<i>from inexperienced young kids,</i>

00:37.174 --> 00:39.111
<i>to the performers</i>
<i>they are today.</i>

00:39.111 --> 00:41.249
I can't believe that
we've done all that stuff.

00:41.249 --> 00:45.023
BRYAN: <i>Now it's time for</i>
<i>the sisters to leave the nest.</i>

00:45.023 --> 00:46.794
MELISSA: It's been such
a great ride together.

00:46.794 --> 00:49.365
BRYAN: <i>But before they go,</i>
<i>they're going to answer</i>

00:49.365 --> 00:51.135
<i>some of the questions</i>
<i>that the fans have been asking</i>

00:51.135 --> 00:52.572
<i>on social media for years.</i>

00:52.572 --> 00:53.574
ABBY LEE:
<i>If those mothers</i>

00:53.574 --> 00:54.776
are dumb enough
to give me credit

00:54.776 --> 00:56.547
for the whole thing,
I'm taking it.

00:56.547 --> 00:58.016
BRYAN:
<i>And finally, they're gonna</i>

00:58.016 --> 00:59.485
<i>share their honest memories</i>

00:59.485 --> 01:02.191
<i>of dancing for the one</i>
<i>and only Abby Lee Miller.</i>

01:02.191 --> 01:04.028
You got to kiss him.

01:04.028 --> 01:06.132
Who else would make you
do that, though?

01:06.132 --> 01:08.303
Come on.
That's what makes me special.

01:11.744 --> 01:14.650
♪ Livin' on the dance floor. ♪

01:14.650 --> 01:16.019
(both laughing)

01:16.019 --> 01:16.787
Hi, girls.

01:20.695 --> 01:22.599
What?
MADDIE: She just wants

01:22.599 --> 01:25.370
to sit on the end so she doesn't
have to sit next to Abby.

01:25.370 --> 01:28.778
Is there an advantage to sitting
next to Abby or a disadvantage?

01:28.778 --> 01:31.282
Well, she's the favorite,
so she gets to sit next to Abby.

01:31.282 --> 01:32.719
BRYAN: All right, I think
we're just hanging out

01:32.719 --> 01:34.523
for a second
until she gets ready.

01:35.925 --> 01:37.127
Ten minutes?

01:37.127 --> 01:38.831
What is she doing?

01:38.831 --> 01:40.100
Is there any silver earrings
I bought?

01:40.100 --> 01:41.737
Like those cool ones?

01:41.737 --> 01:43.139
No?
BRYAN:
No.

01:43.139 --> 01:44.543
No.

01:44.543 --> 01:45.912
BRYAN: Kids, yeah,
think of the beginning

01:45.912 --> 01:47.281
when we were talking
about doing this special,

01:47.281 --> 01:49.285
you were a little hesitant?
Yeah.

01:49.285 --> 01:50.353
Why was that?

01:50.353 --> 01:51.724
I was scared that Abby
was gonna yell at me.

01:51.724 --> 01:53.126
(chuckles)
Why would she yell at you?

01:53.126 --> 01:54.863
'Cause she yells at me
all the time.

01:54.863 --> 01:56.934
I get yelled at the most.

01:56.934 --> 01:59.405
Faster, faster, faster!
You cannot slow a pee‐wee down.

01:59.405 --> 02:00.608
It looks ridiculous.

02:00.608 --> 02:03.012
If you have to suck a yawn up
one more time,

02:03.012 --> 02:04.148
you're not in the dance.

02:04.148 --> 02:05.484
Am I that boring?

02:05.484 --> 02:07.454
Do I need to scream
a little louder?

02:07.454 --> 02:09.191
You keep doing it wrong.

02:09.191 --> 02:12.431
You're wasting my time.

02:12.431 --> 02:14.770
Mackenzie, your head does not

02:14.770 --> 02:17.074
go down.

02:17.074 --> 02:19.245
What's your expectations
for today?

02:19.245 --> 02:20.581
I hope we just have fun,

02:20.581 --> 02:23.186
and I get a lot
of dirty secrets about Abby.

02:23.186 --> 02:24.556
Like?

02:24.556 --> 02:25.525
Why she always

02:25.525 --> 02:26.827
<i>has her hair in curlers?</i>

02:26.827 --> 02:28.731
MACKENZIE:
<i>Where does she go at night?</i>

02:28.731 --> 02:31.068
MADDIE: <i>She's usually going to,</i>
<i>like, McDonald's or something.</i>

02:32.271 --> 02:34.375
No, that's
literally where she goes.

02:34.375 --> 02:36.880
WOMAN: There's a bag
of earrings.
MAN: Why don't we
take this out and we can do

02:36.880 --> 02:39.218
our final touch‐up with
jewelry out...
Yeah, that's
good. Let's start walkin'.

02:39.218 --> 02:40.755
Is she almost ready?

02:40.755 --> 02:42.759
Really?

02:43.928 --> 02:47.201
Oh, my thighs
are gonna be chafing.

02:47.201 --> 02:48.269
Oh, you look nice.
Hi!

02:48.269 --> 02:50.875
Hi.
Mackenzie, you can't be in it

02:50.875 --> 02:51.810
'cause you don't match us.

02:51.810 --> 02:53.479
Okay.

02:56.385 --> 02:57.789
Do you have a skirt on?
Yeah.

02:57.789 --> 02:59.626
Wow, I've never seen you
in a skirt.

03:00.628 --> 03:02.097
Nice.

03:02.097 --> 03:03.132
(laughs)

03:03.132 --> 03:04.803
BRYAN: Abby, why don't
you tell the girls

03:04.803 --> 03:06.105
why we're here today.

03:06.105 --> 03:07.542
Girls, we're here today

03:07.542 --> 03:09.044
to take a little trip

03:09.044 --> 03:10.681
down memory lane.
This is gonna be

03:10.681 --> 03:14.789
our last hurrah
on television together.

03:14.789 --> 03:16.158
Maybe.

03:16.158 --> 03:19.198
But who knows
what the future holds, right?

03:22.772 --> 03:25.210
How old were you
when you started the ALDC?

03:25.210 --> 03:26.680
I think I was
two or three.

03:26.680 --> 03:29.118
I'm pretty sure.

03:29.118 --> 03:30.287
I was four. Four.
Four?

03:30.287 --> 03:31.657
Maddie and Mackenzie's
dad, Kurt,

03:31.657 --> 03:34.596
went to high school
with me. And...

03:34.596 --> 03:37.267
he knew that my studio was

03:37.267 --> 03:39.071
the best studio
in our town. He knew

03:39.071 --> 03:41.208
that I traveled all over
the country with my students,

03:41.208 --> 03:42.879
that they went
to a lot of competitions,

03:42.879 --> 03:44.415
and that they won.

03:44.415 --> 03:46.887
When it was time to put both of
his daughters into dance class,

03:46.887 --> 03:49.258
he brought them to me.

03:49.258 --> 03:50.995
Maddie made
an incredible first impression.

03:50.995 --> 03:53.199
She walked
into the studio,

03:53.199 --> 03:57.174
and she was
just this cupcake. This...

03:57.174 --> 03:59.378
<i>tiny little body</i>
<i>and this big head</i>

03:59.378 --> 04:00.781
<i>and these gorgeous big eyes.</i>

04:00.781 --> 04:02.451
And you just wanted
to eat her up.

04:02.451 --> 04:05.390
And she looked me in the eye,
and she spoke for herself,

04:05.390 --> 04:08.162
which I loved that her parents
weren't speaking for her.

04:08.162 --> 04:11.402
And she said, "I want
to take tap and hip‐hop."

04:11.402 --> 04:14.274
And I was like, "Uh,
who does this kid think she is?"

04:14.274 --> 04:16.078
I don't even remember that
at all.

04:16.078 --> 04:18.416
Like, I remember me dancing
at the studio,

04:18.416 --> 04:20.654
but I just don't remember me
walking in and, like,

04:20.654 --> 04:22.491
saying that stuff.
BRYAN:
But you let her in

04:22.491 --> 04:24.395
hip‐hop class, right?
Even though she was only four?

04:24.395 --> 04:26.666
ABBY LEE: I said to the teacher,
"You know what?

04:26.666 --> 04:28.837
"Let her take the class.
She's gonna get in there.

04:28.837 --> 04:30.574
"She's not gonna be able
to do it.

04:30.574 --> 04:32.177
She's gonna come out crying."

04:32.177 --> 04:33.847
That's not what happened.

04:33.847 --> 04:37.254
That night, the teacher said,
"Uh, who is that little kid

04:37.254 --> 04:39.124
in my class?" And I thought,
"Ugh, here it comes."

04:39.124 --> 04:40.126
And she's like,

04:40.126 --> 04:42.030
"She was the best one. She is

04:42.030 --> 04:44.869
so smart. She was better
than any of the other kids."

04:44.869 --> 04:47.040
And I went‐‐ ding‐‐

04:47.040 --> 04:48.209
"Maybe I have a star here."

04:48.209 --> 04:49.311
BRYAN: What about your
first memory

04:49.311 --> 04:50.213
of Mackenzie?

04:50.213 --> 04:52.050
I remember the hair,
a lot of hair,

04:52.050 --> 04:53.520
like Goldie Hawn
or something.

04:53.520 --> 04:54.989
Like, big hair.
And those teeth.

04:56.258 --> 04:57.762
I'm sorry,

04:57.762 --> 05:00.233
<i>she just had that whole</i>
<i>little kid thing going on</i>

05:00.233 --> 05:02.137
<i>with the roof of her mouth,</i>
<i>and she was</i>

05:02.137 --> 05:04.576
absolutely adorable.
Well, you were a baby.

05:04.576 --> 05:07.882
Oh, yeah.
Literally.
A toddler. And then

05:07.882 --> 05:09.318
you grew up at the dance studio.

05:09.318 --> 05:11.222
Every day,
you were there.

05:11.222 --> 05:12.324
I just remember

05:12.324 --> 05:14.328
the first day of
<i>Dance Moms,</i> I think

05:14.328 --> 05:16.600
everyone was super excited.
We were like, "We're gonna be

05:16.600 --> 05:18.871
on TV." I had no clue
that we were gonna learn

05:18.871 --> 05:21.242
a new dance every week.
I‐I thought
No, neither did I.

05:21.242 --> 05:22.512
we were just gonna do
the same dance
Neither did I.

05:22.512 --> 05:25.183
at every competition.
I didn't even realize...

05:25.183 --> 05:26.520
I didn't even know
what the show was about.

05:26.520 --> 05:28.624
Yeah, I didn't think it
would just become what

05:28.624 --> 05:31.563
it has been‐‐ about all the moms
fighting and then you

05:31.563 --> 05:32.999
being, like, the main focus.

05:32.999 --> 05:35.403
You think I'm the main focus?
Yeah.

05:35.403 --> 05:36.438
Yes.
No, I‐I
kind of think

05:36.438 --> 05:37.909
you're
the main focus, babe.

05:37.909 --> 05:40.881
No, you're the main focus,
for sure. You just wanted

05:40.881 --> 05:42.184
to hear me say that, didn't you?

05:42.184 --> 05:45.356
Yes! Again and again
and again.

05:45.356 --> 05:47.260
What was going through your mind
during those first six episodes?

05:47.260 --> 05:49.431
I try not to remember

05:49.431 --> 05:52.437
those first
six episodes.
We look completely different.

05:52.437 --> 05:54.274
How 'bout me?
I didn't think I was
You look the most different.

05:54.274 --> 05:56.646
<i>ever going to be on television</i>
<i>with that hair</i>

05:56.646 --> 05:57.848
<i>and the makeup. I never</i>

05:57.848 --> 06:00.019
<i>thought anybody</i>
<i>was gonna watch this show.</i>

06:00.019 --> 06:02.390
I would have done my hair
and my makeup. I would have

06:02.390 --> 06:04.228
worn something better.

06:04.228 --> 06:05.764
I was just
in there trying

06:05.764 --> 06:06.866
to get routines finished

06:06.866 --> 06:08.202
and choreograph stuff.

06:08.202 --> 06:12.177
And all I knew is
this might be

06:12.177 --> 06:15.951
a chance
to do something wonderful.

06:15.951 --> 06:18.389
So, let's take a look
at what you all looked like

06:18.389 --> 06:20.026
during season one.

06:20.026 --> 06:22.230
These are my two daughters,
Maddie and Mackenzie.

06:22.230 --> 06:25.470
Maddie's eight and Mackenzie's
six. And they're both dancers.
Look at you. Look at that face!

06:25.470 --> 06:31.048
<i>Maddie has won everything that</i>
<i>she's done in the last year.</i>

06:31.048 --> 06:33.419
<i>She was undefeated last year.</i>
(laughter)

06:33.419 --> 06:37.160
<i>Her whole life revolves</i>
<i>around dance.</i>

06:37.160 --> 06:38.897
<i>It's constant.</i>
<i>But she loves it.</i>

06:38.897 --> 06:42.672
You can do cartwheels
all around the room.
I don't care. You always tap.

06:42.672 --> 06:44.207
<i>Abby is a star‐maker.</i>
<i>She's gonna</i>

06:44.207 --> 06:46.880
make my daughter be the best
she can be.

06:46.880 --> 06:49.519
And she will make her a star.

06:49.519 --> 06:51.690
Mackenzie,
that right there...

06:51.690 --> 06:53.760
"You always tap."
See, why did I not

06:53.760 --> 06:56.599
just forget about Maddie
and take you,

06:56.599 --> 06:59.872
move to Hollywood, and make you
the next actress star.

06:59.872 --> 07:01.442
Look at that face!

07:01.442 --> 07:02.812
(laughs)

07:02.812 --> 07:05.350
So, throughout
our time together today, uh,

07:05.350 --> 07:07.454
you guys are gonna be answering
some fan questions.

07:07.454 --> 07:10.627
So, right on the table in front
of you are fan questions.

07:10.627 --> 07:12.631
So whenever you're feeling it,
I want you to reach over,

07:12.631 --> 07:13.834
grab a question.

07:13.834 --> 07:14.736
Go ahead, Mackenzie.

07:18.610 --> 07:20.714
(chuckles)

07:20.714 --> 07:22.551
ABBY LEE:
<i>Pyramid is</i>

07:22.551 --> 07:23.185
grueling.

07:23.185 --> 07:24.522
Seriously.

07:24.522 --> 07:27.260
On <i>Dance Moms,</i> pyramid is

07:27.260 --> 07:29.364
two minutes long.
Not even.

07:29.364 --> 07:31.268
But, actually,

07:31.268 --> 07:33.840
<i>it's four hours long.</i>

07:33.840 --> 07:37.380
(clock ticking)

07:37.380 --> 07:39.384
ABBY LEE: <i>I see you laughing</i>
<i>all the time and talking</i>

07:39.384 --> 07:41.689
<i>and everybody's eyes wandering.</i>

07:41.689 --> 07:43.292
<i>Fingers in the mouth.</i>

07:43.292 --> 07:44.962
<i>Oh, I see it all. I see it all.</i>

07:44.962 --> 07:48.737
MACKENZIE: <i>Once you take off</i>
<i>the paper, you say,</i>

07:48.737 --> 07:50.473
<i>"You're on the bottom</i>
<i>because of your mom."</i>

07:50.473 --> 07:52.477
<i>And then the moms get crazy.</i>

07:52.477 --> 07:54.381
(audio fast‐forwarding)

07:54.381 --> 07:56.485
<i>And then it just takes longer.</i>

07:56.485 --> 07:58.557
MADDIE: <i>Sometimes we'll take</i>
<i>breaks, we'll leave,</i>

07:58.557 --> 08:00.293
<i>we'll come back and finish it.</i>

08:00.293 --> 08:01.830
MACKENZIE: <i>And then, like,</i>
<i>someone either walks out</i>

08:01.830 --> 08:03.567
<i>or you walk out. And then</i>
<i>we don't finish pyramid.</i>

08:03.567 --> 08:06.138
<i>And then we just look</i>
<i>at the pictures.</i>

08:06.138 --> 08:08.142
<i>We can't even talk.</i>
<i>We can't say anything.</i>

08:08.142 --> 08:09.612
MADDIE: <i>We sit there</i>
<i>for four hours doing...</i>

08:09.612 --> 08:11.583
ABBY LEE:
<i>Well, that's the thing is</i>

08:11.583 --> 08:14.522
<i>you can't sit there.</i>
<i>You have to stand.</i>
(bell dings)

08:14.522 --> 08:16.325
That's why I liked
the old pyramid.
And a dancer doesn't like

08:16.325 --> 08:18.429
to stand. What was
the old pyramid?
That's why I
liked the first season.

08:18.429 --> 08:19.732
<i>Because we got to sit</i>
<i>on the floor.</i>
<i>We got to sit on the floor.</i>

08:19.732 --> 08:21.769
ABBY:
<i>Oh...</i>
<i>And we got to stretch</i>

08:21.769 --> 08:23.874
while we were sitting
there.
Well, yes. That was better.

08:23.874 --> 08:26.345
Abby, talk about the first
pyramid. Do you remember it?

08:26.345 --> 08:29.585
The very first pyramid
was a chalkboard. Seriously.

08:29.585 --> 08:32.223
MADDIE:
<i>And your chalk broke.</i>
ABBY LEE: <i>Yeah, the chalk</i>

08:32.223 --> 08:34.327
<i>would break, it would screech,</i>
<i>I would get chills.</i>

08:34.327 --> 08:36.231
It was horrible.
I do remember physically

08:36.231 --> 08:38.402
turning the chalkboard around

08:38.402 --> 08:39.805
because the wheels
were broken,

08:39.805 --> 08:41.308
<i>and one of them fell off</i>

08:41.308 --> 08:44.715
<i>and we had to, like,</i>
<i>lift it up and flip it around.</i>

08:44.715 --> 08:46.719
Okay, here we go.

08:49.257 --> 08:50.894
Maddie and Mackenzie,
you guys sometimes get annoyed

08:50.894 --> 08:53.365
with Mom during pyramid.
MACKENZIE: I usually get annoyed

08:53.365 --> 08:54.702
by my mom
because she talks

08:54.702 --> 08:57.340
about the other moms
in front of their faces,

08:57.340 --> 08:58.877
and I'm just like,
"Well, you shouldn't do that."

08:58.877 --> 09:00.479
Talk about them behind
their back, Mother!

09:00.479 --> 09:01.983
What's wrong with you?
And not just that.

09:01.983 --> 09:04.889
She goes, "Oh, well,
Maddie does this,

09:04.889 --> 09:07.360
and Mackenzie does this,
and Maddie's amazing."
"Yeah, so Maddie just got this."

09:07.360 --> 09:08.730
Maddie's not gonna
be here tomorrow.

09:08.730 --> 09:12.003
It's the Disney 60th
Anniversary Special.

09:12.003 --> 09:13.005
Maddie's a featured dancer.

09:13.005 --> 09:14.575
Elton John is singing.

09:14.575 --> 09:15.677
BOTH:
Mom!

09:15.677 --> 09:17.013
I'm like, "We don't care, Mom.

09:17.013 --> 09:18.315
And no one else cares either."

09:18.315 --> 09:19.652
And then she talks with
Jill, and she goes...

09:20.854 --> 09:21.856
(giggling loudly)

09:21.856 --> 09:26.666
Our first feud happened in 1994.

09:26.666 --> 09:27.868
Can we demonstrate,
Jill and I?

09:27.868 --> 09:30.272
Give me a stick.

09:30.272 --> 09:31.274
(imitates whip cracking)

09:31.274 --> 09:32.276
Yeah...

09:32.276 --> 09:34.114
Why?! Why?!

09:34.114 --> 09:37.020
Why?! Why...

09:37.020 --> 09:39.592
Yeah, they act like
they're two.
And then
everyone's like, "Shush."

09:39.592 --> 09:41.294
So you don't want her speaking
at all during pyramid.
MADDIE: No.

09:41.294 --> 09:43.933
No.
I don't want her to talk
during pyramid at all.

09:43.933 --> 09:46.204
We don't want to get
yelled at. (laughs)
Yeah.

09:46.204 --> 09:48.208
(laughs)
See, they figured it out.

09:48.208 --> 09:51.248
When the mothers start flapping
the lips, I can't stand it,

09:51.248 --> 09:54.889
and Melissa does it
all the time, and the girls know

09:54.889 --> 09:57.594
if their mother is the one that
causes trouble during pyramid,

09:57.594 --> 10:00.433
they're the ones
that are gonna get...

10:00.433 --> 10:04.207
well, let's just say,
the brunt of my words later on.

10:04.207 --> 10:06.311
BRYAN: Speaking of Melissa's
bad habits‐‐

10:06.311 --> 10:09.117
way back,
you assigned these two a duet.

10:09.117 --> 10:11.054
Do you remember?

10:11.054 --> 10:12.991
You guys are sisters.
It's natural that you would be

10:12.991 --> 10:14.360
put in a routine together.

10:14.360 --> 10:18.335
So I gave you two a routine
called, "Run From Mother."

10:18.335 --> 10:20.841
ANNOUNCER:
All right, moving into
the junior duo‐trio division,

10:20.841 --> 10:23.445
we have Maddie and Mackenzie
with "Run From Mother."

10:23.445 --> 10:26.218
(applause)

10:26.218 --> 10:29.290
Mackenzie, you had to be
scared to death.

When you see somebody every day,
and you're with someone

11:32.383 --> 11:34.655
every day,
you just become like family.

11:34.655 --> 11:36.458
BRYAN: Abby, you used to go
to family dinners

11:36.458 --> 11:37.995
with Melissa
and the kids, right?

11:37.995 --> 11:40.800
Do you remember having them
show off, doing tricks

11:40.800 --> 11:43.305
in restaurants?
I think a lot of my teaching

11:43.305 --> 11:46.077
goes on outside
the classroom.

11:46.077 --> 11:47.446
So, when we're together

11:47.446 --> 11:49.952
and we're having dinner.
And we're in a restaurant

11:49.952 --> 11:53.191
and somebody comes by and says,
"Oh, your girls are so cute."

11:53.191 --> 11:55.296
And I would say, "Mackenzie,
get up. Do a side aerial

11:55.296 --> 11:57.166
"right here.
Go ahead, do it. Maddie,

11:57.166 --> 11:58.268
Maddie, get up.
Do a turn."

11:58.268 --> 12:00.272
I just remember that you
always said to make sure

12:00.272 --> 12:01.609
we have booty shorts
on under our dress

12:01.609 --> 12:03.011
in case you have to show a trick

12:03.011 --> 12:05.784
to someone at a restaurant
or something.

12:05.784 --> 12:06.986
You never know when you're gonna
have to walk on your hands

12:06.986 --> 12:08.923
<i>across the floor,</i>
<i>right Mackenzie?</i>

12:08.923 --> 12:10.760
Who else would
make you do that, though?

12:10.760 --> 12:11.829
Come on.

12:11.829 --> 12:13.198
Your friends
that dance other places,

12:13.198 --> 12:14.702
their dance teachers don't make
them do things like that.

12:14.702 --> 12:16.037
Mm‐mmm.

12:16.037 --> 12:17.708
That's what makes me special.

12:17.708 --> 12:20.479
BRYAN:
Since you guys are such experts
at performing on the spot, let's

12:20.479 --> 12:22.718
play a little game. You're gonna
have to say as many nice things

12:22.718 --> 12:24.555
as you can about your sister
in ten seconds.

12:24.555 --> 12:27.561
Oh!
ABBY LEE:
Or... just blatant things, or

12:27.561 --> 12:28.730
real things?
BRYAN: Really nice.
Really nice things.

12:28.730 --> 12:30.032
Nice things.
I don't want
to do it!

12:30.032 --> 12:31.902
Are they true things or
you're just saying nice words?

12:31.902 --> 12:33.238
No, it's...
True things.
Oh, okay.

12:33.238 --> 12:34.575
You go first.

12:34.575 --> 12:35.777
ABBY LEE: Are you ready?
No.

12:35.777 --> 12:37.013
On your mark,

12:37.013 --> 12:39.150
get set, go!

12:39.150 --> 12:41.321
You're pretty,
you are a good dancer,

12:41.321 --> 12:42.591
you have pretty eyes.

12:45.229 --> 12:47.901
Um, you have good hair,
you have good style...

12:47.901 --> 12:49.437
(buzzing)
Time's up.

12:49.437 --> 12:50.840
I had five.

12:50.840 --> 12:52.043
Can you top her?
Mm‐hmm.

12:52.043 --> 12:54.581
All right, ready?
On your mark, get set, go.

12:54.581 --> 12:58.321
You're very cute, you're funny,
you're hilarious,

12:58.321 --> 13:00.459
you attract boys.
Uh, you're...

13:00.459 --> 13:03.265
you have really good
tumbling tricks, uh, you have

13:03.265 --> 13:05.169
really big eyes,
you have cute hair...

13:05.169 --> 13:06.404
(buzzing)
BRYAN: Time's up.

13:06.404 --> 13:07.841
Seven.
Maddie won.

13:07.841 --> 13:09.343
But she had
more compliments

13:09.343 --> 13:12.249
about me than I had about her,

13:12.249 --> 13:13.653
so I pretty much won.

13:13.653 --> 13:15.990
BRYAN: It's time
for a fan question, Maddie.

13:15.990 --> 13:17.694
Oh, I'll do one.

13:25.042 --> 13:26.612
JILL:
<i>Our plan</i>

13:26.612 --> 13:28.983
is to prove
what we have known all along:

13:28.983 --> 13:32.490
<i>that Maddie gets</i>
<i>extra private time.</i>

13:32.490 --> 13:34.595
We know it's going on,
we need proof.

13:34.595 --> 13:37.399
Get in that studio.
I'll stand watch.

13:40.405 --> 13:42.911
Did you... You got it?
I got it.

13:42.911 --> 13:44.313
Did you get video?
(gasps)
I got video.

13:44.313 --> 13:46.919
CHRISTI:
<i>Maddie's choreography</i>

13:46.919 --> 13:48.455
<i>and Chloe's choreography</i>

13:48.455 --> 13:50.325
were not even
in the same stratosphere.

13:50.325 --> 13:52.229
I thought Chloe's solo
was very technical.

13:52.229 --> 13:53.331
No, it wasn't.

13:53.331 --> 13:55.904
She danced fabulous!
She was amazing!

13:55.904 --> 13:58.609
Her choreography
didn't allow her to win!

13:58.609 --> 14:01.782
I don't really think any of our
privates were very secretive.

14:01.782 --> 14:04.120
I might have had more
privates because my mom

14:04.120 --> 14:06.692
scheduled more privates with us.
And I think that we
weren't the only ones

14:06.692 --> 14:08.529
that got good choreography.
I think everyone

14:08.529 --> 14:10.199
got chor...
good choreography.
No. No.

14:10.199 --> 14:12.537
And maybe it's just the way
you take it and...

14:12.537 --> 14:16.344
There you go. People are given
a step by their dance teacher.

14:16.344 --> 14:17.981
We choreograph a routine.

14:17.981 --> 14:19.952
It's what they do with it,
it's what they

14:19.952 --> 14:22.557
make the choreography look like
when they step on stage.

14:22.557 --> 14:25.530
I think they assumed
you were getting

14:25.530 --> 14:27.534
all these extras because

14:27.534 --> 14:28.903
Melissa and Abby
went to dinner,

14:28.903 --> 14:31.174
or Mackenzie and Maddie get to

14:31.174 --> 14:33.011
do this
and get to do that, because

14:33.011 --> 14:34.480
Melissa helped Abby out.

14:34.480 --> 14:36.484
Whatever it was,
it was always an excuse

14:36.484 --> 14:38.689
so they didn't
have to give you credit

14:38.689 --> 14:41.662
for being great,
hard‐working kids.

14:41.662 --> 14:44.200
BRYAN: Abby, weren't you closer
with Maddie and Mackenzie

14:44.200 --> 14:45.803
than the other girls?

14:45.803 --> 14:47.507
Maddie and Mackenzie and I

14:47.507 --> 14:49.010
share several bonds.

14:49.010 --> 14:50.513
There were
some difficult times

14:50.513 --> 14:52.884
while you two
were at the dance studio.

14:52.884 --> 14:54.287
Their mom and dad
got divorced.

14:54.287 --> 14:56.391
I think that your dancing
kind of protected you,

14:56.391 --> 14:57.459
a little bit, from all that.

14:57.459 --> 14:59.564
Mm‐hmm.
And you
had somewhere else to be

14:59.564 --> 15:00.967
and something
to keep your mind on.

15:00.967 --> 15:04.173
After that, it wasn't long that,
um, my mom got sick.

15:04.173 --> 15:07.479
I think that's
what made us closer.

15:07.479 --> 15:09.283
In those final days

15:09.283 --> 15:10.820
of my mother's life,

15:10.820 --> 15:13.626
Melissa was there every day.

15:13.626 --> 15:17.032
She would always drive me
in her Cadillac car,

15:17.032 --> 15:18.201
and I remember
she would

15:18.201 --> 15:20.038
<i>come to our rehearsals.</i>
<i>Sometimes she'd</i>

15:20.038 --> 15:21.174
<i>bring Baby in the room,</i>
<i>and Baby would</i>

15:21.174 --> 15:22.176
<i>run around when we were</i>

15:22.176 --> 15:23.411
<i>dancing and it was...</i>

15:23.411 --> 15:25.583
it was really fun. And...
And she was really sweet

15:25.583 --> 15:27.119
to all of the girls.
Like, she would

15:27.119 --> 15:30.459
buy us really good presents
for our birthdays,

15:30.459 --> 15:32.764
and she was just
really sweet.

15:32.764 --> 15:34.400
ABBY LEE: Yeah.

15:34.400 --> 15:36.437
<i>My mom wanted</i>
<i>to inspire children</i>

15:36.437 --> 15:38.408
to love being on the stage.

15:38.408 --> 15:40.947
And I think she did that
with both of you.

15:40.947 --> 15:42.216
Mm‐hmm.

15:42.216 --> 15:44.053
Let's take a look
at a clip with Mrs. Miller.

15:44.053 --> 15:45.122
ABBY LEE:
<i>Hi, mom!</i>

15:45.122 --> 15:47.493
Hi, Abby. How are you?
How are you? Good,

15:47.493 --> 15:49.263
good, good.
How are you?

15:49.263 --> 15:52.169
This week, moms,
I might not be there.

15:52.169 --> 15:55.643
As you know,
my mother is dying.

15:55.643 --> 15:59.216
She's not gonna get better.
She's not gonna be cured.

16:06.965 --> 16:08.669
There's some place better.

16:09.871 --> 16:11.575
I think my mom

16:11.575 --> 16:13.144
thought of you two
as her grandchildren

16:13.144 --> 16:15.215
that she never had.

16:15.215 --> 16:16.451
We think of her
as a grandma, too.

16:16.451 --> 16:18.556
She predicted
that you would both be stars.

16:18.556 --> 16:20.626
I know she's watching

16:20.626 --> 16:22.463
every move that you make.

16:22.463 --> 16:24.266
You did something a little bit
unusual at the services.

16:24.266 --> 16:26.972
"Broadway Baby"?

16:26.972 --> 16:28.509
Oh, I remember
my baby cousin went

16:28.509 --> 16:30.580
with my mom to visit
Mrs. Miller,

16:30.580 --> 16:31.615
and the whole time
she was playing

16:31.615 --> 16:33.552
<i>with Broadway Baby.</i>

16:33.552 --> 16:35.288
<i>She thought it was real.</i>
MACKENZIE:
<i>She thought the dog was real.</i>

16:35.288 --> 16:37.861
It was real.
Well, it was, but

16:37.861 --> 16:39.330
it was stuffed.
But the...
What it was...

16:39.330 --> 16:41.400
And she loved that dog.
She kept playing with it.

16:41.400 --> 16:44.808
She was like... Yeah.
She would play
with his nails.

16:44.808 --> 16:47.112
'Cause it sat still for her,
and let her do it.

16:47.112 --> 16:48.414
MADDIE:
Yeah.
That's right. I know.

16:48.414 --> 16:51.254
Broadway Baby's death
was really tough, right?

16:51.254 --> 16:53.692
When she passed,
it was awful. It was

16:53.692 --> 16:56.163
as bad as both my dad
and my mom.

16:56.163 --> 16:57.967
We baby‐sat her
for, like, ten days,

16:57.967 --> 17:00.005
and she lost, like,
six pounds with us.

17:00.005 --> 17:02.142
(laughing)
Because we didn't
feed her Big Macs.

17:02.142 --> 17:03.979
And then when she
went right back

17:03.979 --> 17:05.750
with you,
she gained it all back.

17:05.750 --> 17:07.452
Yeah.

17:07.452 --> 17:09.089
Yeah, I'm sure she did.

17:09.089 --> 17:11.160
Where's Broadway Baby now?

17:11.160 --> 17:13.666
My mom
and my dad's ashes

17:13.666 --> 17:15.803
and my dog,
Broadway Baby,

17:15.803 --> 17:19.276
<i>are in a gorgeous,</i>
<i>gorgeous cemetery</i>

17:19.276 --> 17:20.913
<i>in Miami, Florida.</i>

17:20.913 --> 17:23.017
<i>They are together</i>
<i>in the casket,</i>

17:23.017 --> 17:24.019
in the wall,

17:24.019 --> 17:26.090
and my place is
right next door to them.

17:26.090 --> 17:28.428
Wow.
Yes.

17:28.428 --> 17:29.531
I don't know

17:29.531 --> 17:30.833
if you remember,

17:30.833 --> 17:33.371
but the week
that Broadway Baby passed away,

17:33.371 --> 17:35.743
I did a solo called
"Showing You My Heart," and

17:35.743 --> 17:38.348
it was dedicated
to your dog, so...
(laughs)

17:38.348 --> 17:40.686
I thought I remembered
every routine.

17:40.686 --> 17:42.857
I'm sure when I see it,
I'll remember.
Yeah.

17:42.857 --> 17:46.732
ANNOUNCER:
Up next on stage is Madison
with "Showing You My Heart."

17:46.732 --> 17:48.836

ANNOUNCER:
Maddie would like
everyone to know

18:31.688 --> 18:35.361
that her performance was
dedicated to Broadway Baby.

18:43.812 --> 18:45.983
I was always a star

ABBY LEE:
Wherever we were competing

18:55.803 --> 18:57.372
CROWD (chanting):
Abby! Abby!

18:57.372 --> 18:59.209
(people screaming)

18:59.209 --> 19:01.681
Every week,
there were more people there.

19:01.681 --> 19:04.052
How has being famous
changed Abby?

19:04.052 --> 19:05.823
And be honest. Abby,

19:05.823 --> 19:07.192
tell 'em they
can be honest.

19:07.192 --> 19:09.196
(laughing): I think fame
has really gotten to Abby.

19:09.196 --> 19:10.331
(laughs)

19:10.331 --> 19:11.968
What does that mean?

19:11.968 --> 19:13.371
She goes, "Water!

19:13.371 --> 19:14.373
(snapping) I need water."

19:14.373 --> 19:15.709
I need a water.

19:16.778 --> 19:17.680
Give me... give me a drink.

19:17.680 --> 19:18.749
Can I have my water?

19:20.151 --> 19:22.690
None of that water's cold.
It's all warm.

19:25.696 --> 19:27.533
You yell at a lot
of our crew.

19:27.533 --> 19:28.802
PRODUCER:
You've yelled at me.

19:28.802 --> 19:30.506
This is over,
this is done,

19:30.506 --> 19:32.877
so, find another show,
sweetheart.

19:32.877 --> 19:34.747
Hey, you're not
telling me what to do.

19:34.747 --> 19:35.950
That's gonna
stop right now.

19:35.950 --> 19:37.152
I'm not listening to you.

19:37.152 --> 19:38.387
You are not allowed back here.

19:38.387 --> 19:39.691
MAN:
Yeah, I am.
No, you're not.

19:39.691 --> 19:40.726
ABBY LEE:
The moms don't

19:40.726 --> 19:42.395
rule the dance studio,
you idiot!

19:42.395 --> 19:44.233
They don't!

19:44.233 --> 19:45.836
If every mother walked
into every studio

19:45.836 --> 19:48.709
and did as they damn please,
no one would have a business.

19:48.709 --> 19:50.512
But you don't know anything
about that.

19:50.512 --> 19:52.750
You work for someone else.

19:54.386 --> 19:56.257
Someone has to.
Who's yelling at them?

19:56.257 --> 19:58.094
No one. They're never
gonna learn.
MADDIE: That's right.

19:58.094 --> 19:59.797
BRYAN:
Talk to me

19:59.797 --> 20:01.768
about you guys
becoming a major force

20:01.768 --> 20:02.970
in the dance world.

20:02.970 --> 20:04.106
ABBY LEE:
I think

20:04.106 --> 20:06.443
at the very beginning,
it was

20:06.443 --> 20:10.552
win a week, lose a week,
do pretty well, a so‐so week.

20:10.552 --> 20:13.257
But then it hit a point
where we were winning

20:13.257 --> 20:15.228
week after week
after week, and

20:15.228 --> 20:17.600
that was exciting for me
to watch‐‐ the hard work

20:17.600 --> 20:19.136
come to be
and see what

20:19.136 --> 20:20.806
you guys could do
with those numbers.

20:20.806 --> 20:22.743
Make some noise for...

20:22.743 --> 20:24.012
ANNOUNCER:
Abby Lee Dance Company.

20:24.012 --> 20:26.618
(cheering)

20:26.618 --> 20:30.491
ALL:
Abby Lee Dance Company!

20:30.491 --> 20:32.295
ANNOUNCER 2: Miss Mackenzie
with act number 18.

20:32.295 --> 20:34.667
ANNOUNCER 3: Act number 32,
"Amazing Grace."

20:34.667 --> 20:35.836
ANNOUNCER 4:
"Beautiful Revenge!"

20:35.836 --> 20:38.407
Oh, I love
that dance.

20:38.407 --> 20:40.345
ALL:
Abby Lee Dance Company!

20:40.345 --> 20:43.017
Abby Lee Dance Company!

20:43.017 --> 20:45.154
How many times do you think
we've said that?

20:45.154 --> 20:45.823
Abby Lee...

20:45.823 --> 20:46.725
Abby Lee...

20:46.725 --> 20:49.429
BOTH:
Abby Lee Dance Company!

20:49.429 --> 20:51.400
It's exciting
to win.
Mm‐hmm.

20:51.400 --> 20:52.670
How many people have
accomplished that?

20:52.670 --> 20:55.041
It's great to be able
to look back at that.

20:55.041 --> 20:57.112
Maddie, you were
a huge part of these wins,

20:57.112 --> 20:58.682
because if it wasn't
your solo

20:58.682 --> 21:00.786
winning the overall
high score, it was

21:00.786 --> 21:02.957
usually a group number
that you were featured in.

21:02.957 --> 21:06.296
But Mackenzie,
we owe a lot to you.

21:06.296 --> 21:07.600
Good job, pal.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.236
You were a huge part
of this team because,

21:09.236 --> 21:11.006
without you,
I don't think the girls

21:11.006 --> 21:13.512
would have won quite as often.
Wow.

21:13.512 --> 21:14.680
BRYAN: What do you
say to that?

21:14.680 --> 21:15.849
That's crazy. (laughs)

21:15.849 --> 21:17.152
I wouldn't think
you would have

21:17.152 --> 21:19.189
said that.
Let's take a look

21:19.189 --> 21:21.895

I don't even

remember half those dances

22:07.987 --> 22:09.524
That was crazy.
They were
beautiful, though.

22:09.524 --> 22:10.626
The Maddie face.

22:10.626 --> 22:12.128
You're so dramatic.
I cried.

22:12.128 --> 22:13.297
She is. That's...

22:13.297 --> 22:14.700
Why do you think
she's in movies and on TV

22:14.700 --> 22:16.170

these other things?

22:16.170 --> 22:17.706

BRYAN:
At one point,

22:19.577 --> 22:22.248
there was a song writer
that was so inspired by

22:22.248 --> 22:24.019
Maddie's work
that she would write songs

22:24.019 --> 22:25.822
for Maddie to perform to.

22:25.822 --> 22:29.530
When I see you dance, what I see
in you is someone who

22:29.530 --> 22:31.200
just has an innate...

22:31.200 --> 22:33.437

23:48.253 --> 23:50.024
"That's it.
We're going to Hollywood"?

23:50.024 --> 23:53.698
I was really excited
that we were going to L. A.,

23:53.698 --> 23:56.403
because
there's a lot of opportunities

23:56.403 --> 23:58.407
and a lot of jobs.
MADDIE:
I was excited

23:58.407 --> 24:00.378
to be in the new studio, because
it's really, really pretty.

24:00.378 --> 24:02.516
MACKENZIE: Yeah.
MADDIE:
And, also, just to, like,

24:02.516 --> 24:05.555
do acting more, and to get
experience with auditioning,

24:05.555 --> 24:07.926
because we can't do
any of that in Pittsburgh.

24:07.926 --> 24:10.097
There's no open auditions,
really.

24:10.097 --> 24:12.903
This is pretty much...
L. A. is the place to work, so...

24:12.903 --> 24:14.540
So were you guys happy
that you moved to L. A.,

24:14.540 --> 24:16.109
sacrificed...
I don't think we moved.

24:16.109 --> 24:17.478
I think we're just visiting.

24:17.478 --> 24:18.882
Aren't we? I am.

24:18.882 --> 24:21.319
Our taxes are still in
Pittsburgh, that's what we said.

24:21.319 --> 24:24.760
Coming to L. A.,
we left our family, our house,

24:24.760 --> 24:27.599
our dog, all of our friends,
our studio at home.

24:27.599 --> 24:30.972
But it's not like
we moved to L. A. forever.

24:30.972 --> 24:32.275
And I think it's good.

24:32.275 --> 24:34.145
It's a good opportunity
to come out here, because

24:34.145 --> 24:35.715
I'm recording
my album out here,

24:35.715 --> 24:37.418
I'm doing a lot
more dance things.

24:37.418 --> 24:39.022
Just a lot
more stuff

24:39.022 --> 24:41.059
in general. (laughs)

24:41.059 --> 24:44.332
Abby, do you want
to take a fan question?

24:54.219 --> 24:55.555
(over phone):
I'm the casting director

24:55.555 --> 24:56.557
for <i>Drop Dead Diva.</i>

24:56.557 --> 24:58.126
We are gonna go with Maddie.

24:58.126 --> 25:00.431
She did a great, great reading.

25:00.431 --> 25:02.335
Her dancing was beautiful.

25:02.335 --> 25:03.605
ABBY LEE:
Are you excited?

25:03.605 --> 25:05.709
Isn't it funny how...
they wanted a blonde,

25:05.709 --> 25:07.311
and she's the only
one that auditioned

25:07.311 --> 25:09.182
that wasn't a blonde?
And isn't it funny

25:09.182 --> 25:11.621
that I'm pretty sure
that Maddie had that part

25:11.621 --> 25:12.656
before she even
auditioned for it.

25:12.656 --> 25:13.691
CHRISTI:
<i>I just wish</i>

25:13.691 --> 25:15.595
<i>that things were fair and even.</i>

25:15.595 --> 25:17.265
<i>Abby absolutely,</i>
<i>100% made sure</i>

25:17.265 --> 25:19.970
that Maddie was gonna get that
role, come hell or high water.

25:19.970 --> 25:21.741
Yeah, I wish I had as much power

25:21.741 --> 25:24.613
as all the other mothers
think I have. I don't.

25:24.613 --> 25:27.385
However, I did push Maddie.

25:27.385 --> 25:29.924
I did fight for her
to do solo after solo

25:29.924 --> 25:30.926
after solo.

25:30.926 --> 25:32.361
That got Maddie on stage

25:32.361 --> 25:33.831
more often
than anybody else.

25:33.831 --> 25:37.573
So that gave her more chances
to be seen by...

25:37.573 --> 25:39.275
someone like Sia.
Also,

25:39.275 --> 25:42.281
everyone thought
that Sia called the studio

25:42.281 --> 25:45.154
and asked Abby
to give their best dancer

25:45.154 --> 25:47.091
for the video, but...

25:47.091 --> 25:49.228
she tweeted me and said,
"Maddie, would you like

25:49.228 --> 25:52.234
to be in my next music video?"
And it just went from there.

25:52.234 --> 25:54.974
And if those mothers are
dumb enough to give me credit

25:54.974 --> 25:56.877
for the whole thing,
I'm taking it.

25:56.877 --> 25:58.013
You were
some little kid

25:58.013 --> 25:59.415
that went to a dance studio
in Pittsburgh,

25:59.415 --> 26:00.919
and now...

26:00.919 --> 26:04.526
it's like... everybody
in the world knows who you are.

26:07.231 --> 26:08.901
BRYAN:
Mackenzie, what I love

26:08.901 --> 26:10.337
about you, it really...

26:10.337 --> 26:11.406
seems like
you sort of

26:11.406 --> 26:13.210
found yourself.
All of a sudden,

26:13.210 --> 26:16.684
season six, you're, like,
this insane hip‐hop dancer.

26:16.684 --> 26:18.020
(laughs)
And everyone's
loving it.

26:18.020 --> 26:20.424
<i>You're posting a lot of</i>
<i>hip‐hop dances on social media.</i>

26:20.424 --> 26:22.929
MACKENZIE: <i>I like to post</i>
<i>the videos that we do,</i>

26:22.929 --> 26:25.300
<i>because Rumer has</i>
<i>great choreography,</i>

26:25.300 --> 26:27.873
so I like to show everyone
her choreography.

26:27.873 --> 26:30.144
But I also like
to show everyone

26:30.144 --> 26:32.181
what I'm doing...
What <i>you're</i> doing.
What you're up to.

26:32.181 --> 26:33.785
at the studio, yes.
Well, it's fun.

26:33.785 --> 26:34.987
It's great advertisement.
It's good.

26:34.987 --> 26:36.122
MADDIE: And now
everyone comes

26:36.122 --> 26:37.425
to our open hip‐hop class now.

26:37.425 --> 26:38.761
Like, every...
all of the hip‐hop boys come,
Literally,

26:38.761 --> 26:40.765
which make it
so much more fun.
there's 100 people there.

26:40.765 --> 26:42.034
Not just because

26:42.034 --> 26:43.705
they're boys, but...

26:43.705 --> 26:45.642
because they're actually...
(laughs) Boy crazy!

26:45.642 --> 26:47.278
they're amazing dancers,

26:47.278 --> 26:50.250
and we learn a lot from them,
because we just, like,

26:50.250 --> 26:52.589
feed off of how amazing...

26:52.589 --> 26:53.658
they are.

26:53.658 --> 26:54.927
You never really dance

26:54.927 --> 26:57.064
as full‐out as you do now,
because you're

26:57.064 --> 26:58.467
more confident with it,
and I think

26:58.467 --> 26:59.937
people love to watch you do it.

26:59.937 --> 27:01.507
And <i>I</i> love
to watch you do it.

27:01.507 --> 27:02.843
BRYAN: All right,
let's take a look

27:02.843 --> 27:04.780
at a number when,
uh, Kenzie killed it.

27:04.780 --> 27:07.786
ANNOUNCER: Welcome to the stage
Mackenzie with "Bully."

the eye rolls all day.

28:10.143 --> 28:12.114
I was just really scared
that it was gonna fall off.

28:12.114 --> 28:13.216
Then I would
have gotten yelled at.

28:13.216 --> 28:14.266
(laughs)

28:21.466 --> 28:23.871
Of course I'm gonna be dancing
with these girls forever.

28:23.871 --> 28:25.440
And I'm gonna stay
at your studio forever.

28:25.440 --> 28:26.944
But I just won't be

28:26.944 --> 28:28.881
filming <i>Dance Moms</i> anymore.

28:28.881 --> 28:30.985
I mean, <i>Dance Moms</i> has had...
gave us so many opportunities,

28:30.985 --> 28:34.025
and same with the ALDC‐‐ I would
have never done the Sia video

28:34.025 --> 28:35.528
or a movie.
But, I mean,

28:35.528 --> 28:37.999
we can't... be on <i>Dance Moms</i>

28:37.999 --> 28:39.970
till we're 18 years old.

28:39.970 --> 28:41.807
I mean,
that's just not how it works.

28:41.807 --> 28:43.376
It's an elite competition team.

28:43.376 --> 28:46.717
We grow up and we move on
to different things.

28:46.717 --> 28:50.157
I'm gonna miss all of the girls,
so that's one reason why

28:50.157 --> 28:51.961
I don't really want to leave,

28:51.961 --> 28:54.198
because I won't be dancing
with them as much.

28:54.198 --> 28:55.334
And she loves me.

28:55.334 --> 28:57.004
She forgot that part.
And...

28:57.004 --> 28:58.941
I love Miss Abby. (laughs)

28:58.941 --> 29:01.145
Maddie and Mackenzie,
because of <i>Dance Moms,</i>

29:01.145 --> 29:03.183
they got a career,

29:03.183 --> 29:05.922
they have a livelihood,
they have a vocation, they have

29:05.922 --> 29:07.391
a future, they have...

29:07.391 --> 29:10.197
memories...
traveling around the world.

29:10.197 --> 29:11.199
Look what we've done!

29:11.199 --> 29:12.301
BRYAN:
You guys have had

29:12.301 --> 29:13.470
some fun
on the show, right?

29:13.470 --> 29:15.407
We've gotten to do
some hilarious things

29:15.407 --> 29:16.944
to A... Miss Abby.

29:16.944 --> 29:19.148
And Miss Abby...
We got to, you know,
That's a positive.

29:19.148 --> 29:22.421
<i>Silly String her.</i>
MACKENZIE:
<i>I got to squirt her with water.</i>

29:22.421 --> 29:25.460
MADDIE: <i>We've got to dunk her</i>
<i>in a tank.</i>

29:25.460 --> 29:28.099
<i>We got in an ice cream fight</i>
<i>with her. I mean, we've done</i>

29:28.099 --> 29:30.270
some pretty hilarious things
to her.
Yep.

29:30.270 --> 29:32.141
And you've enjoyed it.
I know you have.
Uh‐huh.

29:32.141 --> 29:34.345
But I‐I feel that I had a hand

29:34.345 --> 29:35.948
in their education,
certainly,

29:35.948 --> 29:37.619
and as well as them growing up.

29:37.619 --> 29:40.625
I just hope that our families
continue to be friends,

29:40.625 --> 29:44.065
and that I'm a part
of their lives always,

29:44.065 --> 29:45.802
and I'm in their ear.

29:45.802 --> 29:47.104
Forever.
Forever?

29:47.104 --> 29:48.607
It's engrained in my head.
Yes.

29:48.607 --> 29:51.613
BRYAN: Let's take a look
at the announcement.

29:51.613 --> 29:52.715
MELISSA: So, I just want
to tell you‐‐

29:52.715 --> 29:55.020
Mackenzie, listen,
What's going on?

29:55.020 --> 29:55.955
'cause you don't
know this‐‐

29:55.955 --> 29:57.592
Maddie, Mackenzie and I

29:57.592 --> 30:00.263
are going to be here

30:00.263 --> 30:01.733
(crying):
for four more weeks...

30:01.733 --> 30:03.269
and then we're moving on.

30:03.269 --> 30:04.405
We'll always be...

30:04.405 --> 30:06.409
I'm sorry.

30:06.409 --> 30:08.681
MACKENZIE: <i>I'm kind of shocked,</i>
<i>because...</i>

30:08.681 --> 30:10.751
all of the girls are, like,

30:10.751 --> 30:12.054
<i>my best friends.</i>

30:12.054 --> 30:13.757
We love you guys so much.

30:13.757 --> 30:15.360
Come here, girls.
(sniffles)

30:15.360 --> 30:18.032
This has been such
a great ride together.

30:18.032 --> 30:20.003
I love you guys so much.

30:20.003 --> 30:22.074
Had you seen
that, Abby?
No.

30:23.143 --> 30:25.413
You were.
Was that
a tough day?

30:25.413 --> 30:27.050
I think everyone
was kind of confused.

30:27.050 --> 30:28.787
Kenzie didn't even know
we were leaving.

30:28.787 --> 30:30.290
I only found out,

30:30.290 --> 30:32.327
I think, the day of,
and my mom

30:32.327 --> 30:34.566
didn't want me to tell
Mackenzie, because Mackenzie's

30:34.566 --> 30:36.737
a blabbermouth, apparently‐‐
that's what my mom said.

30:36.737 --> 30:38.574
So...
Abby's a
blabbermouth.

30:38.574 --> 30:40.277
(laughs)

30:40.277 --> 30:41.947
People look at this

30:41.947 --> 30:45.855
as a negative or a... or a...
parting of ways,

30:45.855 --> 30:48.459
and I look at it
as another success story...

30:48.459 --> 30:50.531
for the ALDC and for me

30:50.531 --> 30:53.203
personally, to have taken
these two little girls,

30:53.203 --> 30:56.910
who could have been cheerleaders
or in the school science club,

30:56.910 --> 30:58.981
or whatever they...
could have been doing

30:58.981 --> 31:02.321
if they didn't join the ALDC‐‐

31:02.321 --> 31:04.258
their lives would be
totally different.

31:04.258 --> 31:05.528
And they know that.

31:05.528 --> 31:07.765
How about
a fan question?

31:15.213 --> 31:17.317
No, I don't get jealous
when you get stuff.

31:17.317 --> 31:19.421
No, I'm very happy for you
when you get jobs.

31:19.421 --> 31:21.125
I think it's cool,
because you did

31:21.125 --> 31:22.528
a Nickelodeon appearance,
and then,

31:22.528 --> 31:23.797
a couple months later,

31:23.797 --> 31:25.768
I did the same show. So...
You did the same one.

31:25.768 --> 31:26.903
it's really cool,
and I think we're

31:26.903 --> 31:28.106
both happy for each other.
I would never

31:28.106 --> 31:29.441
get jealous of you, like,

31:29.441 --> 31:31.813
when you do your music videos,
because I was in them,

31:31.813 --> 31:34.151
so it doesn't
really matter, so...
You almost weren't.

31:34.151 --> 31:36.723
(laughs)
Yeah, I know. True.

31:36.723 --> 31:39.194
One is a yes.
Three is a yes.

31:39.194 --> 31:40.731
What are you gonna do
about your sister?

31:40.731 --> 31:42.067
MACKENZIE:
I guess she's a yes.

31:42.067 --> 31:45.073
Do you really want her
in the video?

31:45.073 --> 31:47.745
I mean, I could use her
as a helper‐‐ she could assist.

31:47.745 --> 31:49.381
That's better.

31:49.381 --> 31:50.450
ABBY LEE:
Number 13.

31:50.450 --> 31:53.189
We feel that you
may be better served

31:53.189 --> 31:54.759
as an assistant.

31:54.759 --> 31:57.464
But I produced and directed it,
so she got in there.

31:57.464 --> 31:59.034
Right?
No, it's because my mom

31:59.034 --> 32:00.571
made me put her in it.

32:00.571 --> 32:03.443
BRYAN: Was that hard for you
to dance backup for Mackenzie?

32:03.443 --> 32:05.848
It wasn't hard for me at all
to dance backup for Mackenzie.

32:05.848 --> 32:07.852
Just yesterday
I danced backup for her,

32:07.852 --> 32:09.455
and I thought
it was really, really fun.

32:09.455 --> 32:10.591
I mean...
And I feel like

32:10.591 --> 32:12.194
you would never sing‐‐
no offense,

32:12.194 --> 32:13.797
No. No.
but I don't think
you would ever sing.

32:13.797 --> 32:16.469
No.
Oh, I don't know
about that.

32:16.469 --> 32:17.972
She can do that.
Well, she's a better
actor than me,

32:17.972 --> 32:19.976
and I'm a better singer
than her.

32:19.976 --> 32:21.546
Perfect.

32:21.546 --> 32:23.550
ABBY LEE:
There you go.
We've talked about

32:23.550 --> 32:24.819
the sisters
being competitive.

32:24.819 --> 32:26.623
There was a dance
this season where the girls

32:26.623 --> 32:28.861
actually got
to battle each other.

32:28.861 --> 32:30.296
Mackenzie, you were
the Ice Queen.

32:30.296 --> 32:32.067
And, Maddie,
you were the...

32:32.067 --> 32:33.169
Queen of Fire.

32:33.169 --> 32:34.506
Uh, you got to battle
each other

32:34.506 --> 32:35.941
to the death.

32:35.941 --> 32:38.446
This is a great number
for sisters, so...

32:38.446 --> 32:40.049
I'm gonna let you two go.
Wait, let me

32:40.049 --> 32:43.957
say something: technically,
you killed me or whatever,

32:43.957 --> 32:46.228
but right after that, you died.
Yeah, but
I still won,

32:46.228 --> 32:48.166
'cause I...
you‐you died first.

32:48.166 --> 32:50.538
Technically, I could've won,
because you still died.

32:50.538 --> 32:53.176
But that's
after you died.

32:53.176 --> 32:54.344
Yes, but...

32:54.344 --> 32:55.915
parts of your costume
fell off, so...

32:55.915 --> 32:57.417
Technically, I won.
You were gonna die

32:57.417 --> 32:59.087
later that day anyhow.
Hey, but that's
not my fault.

32:59.087 --> 33:00.123
I know.

33:00.123 --> 33:02.027
(laughing)
Let's watch.

33:02.027 --> 33:03.964
Let's see what... who really
killed who here, let's see.

33:03.964 --> 33:05.400
