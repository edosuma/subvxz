01:39.231 --> 01:42.197
Target in position. All
hands back to stations.

01:55.888 --> 01:57.622
Prepare to fire.

02:10.340 --> 02:15.560
Please! Get me out of here!

03:54.394 --> 03:57.993
_

04:35.133 --> 04:39.307
Ceres was once covered in ice.

04:39.410 --> 04:42.876
Enough water for 1,000 generations.

04:42.996 --> 04:49.026
Until Earth and Mars stripped
it away for themselves.

04:49.107 --> 04:53.223
This station became the
most vital port in the Belt.

04:53.332 --> 04:58.387
But, the immense wealth and
resources that flow through our gates

04:58.439 --> 05:00.564
were never meant for us.

05:00.610 --> 05:02.493
Belters work the docks,

05:02.528 --> 05:05.527
loading and unloading precious cargo.

05:05.562 --> 05:11.150
We fix the pipes and filters that
keep this rock living and breathing.

05:11.744 --> 05:17.121
We Belters toil and suffer,
without hope and without end.

05:17.156 --> 05:18.892
And for what?

05:18.981 --> 05:23.877
One day, Mars will use its might to
wrest control of Ceres from Earth,

05:24.088 --> 05:27.437
and Earth will go to war to take it back.

05:27.472 --> 05:29.469
It's all the same to us.

05:29.615 --> 05:32.984
No matter who controls Ceres, our home,

05:33.042 --> 05:36.848
to them, we will always be slaves.

05:36.988 --> 05:39.986
That's all we are to
the Earthers and Dusters.

05:40.106 --> 05:43.742
They built their solar system on our backs,

05:43.788 --> 05:46.538
spilled the blood of a
million of our brothers.

05:46.573 --> 05:50.328
But in their eyes, we're
not even human anymore.

05:50.394 --> 05:53.703
So, the next time you look
in the mirror, say the word.

05:53.738 --> 05:54.757
Slave.

05:54.792 --> 05:57.052
Every time we demand to be heard,

05:57.087 --> 05:59.922
they hold back our water, owkwa beltalowda,

06:00.027 --> 06:02.445
ration our air, ereluf beltalowda,

06:02.480 --> 06:04.456
until we crawl back into our holes,

06:04.491 --> 06:07.565
imbobo beltalowda, and do as we are told.

06:10.439 --> 06:12.199
Watch your eyes.

06:12.261 --> 06:14.564
People get killed over
a wrong look around here.

06:14.636 --> 06:16.124
We could run him in for inciting.

06:16.159 --> 06:18.931
- Time and a place.
- Hey, you, Badge.

06:21.300 --> 06:23.477
Day's coming soon, keya?

06:23.512 --> 06:25.565
And when the blood is on the wall,

06:25.606 --> 06:28.027
sasa ke which side you're on?

06:28.599 --> 06:30.264
Yeah, I'll know.

06:30.426 --> 06:33.206
See you then, welwala.

06:33.614 --> 06:37.569
What is welwala?

06:38.599 --> 06:40.599
"Traitor to my people."

06:41.801 --> 06:43.801
Come on, we have work to do.

06:51.599 --> 06:54.256
Just tell me what happened. Take your time.

07:08.879 --> 07:12.286
- Forgotten arm, keya?
- Forgotten arm, yeah.

07:12.677 --> 07:14.156
Hmm.

07:22.511 --> 07:25.921
If any of these guys
come round again, shoah.

07:31.864 --> 07:34.864
All right, let in the
coroner. Let him clean it up.

07:42.505 --> 07:44.681
What did she mean, "forgotten arm"?

07:44.782 --> 07:47.003
The thing you never see coming.

07:47.038 --> 07:51.564
Don't start. You are never
gonna pass for a Belter.

07:51.599 --> 07:53.864
Every time they look at you,
they're always gonna see Earth.

07:53.924 --> 07:56.565
Coming from a guy dressed like an Earther.

07:56.871 --> 07:58.871
What's the deal with the hat?

07:59.809 --> 08:01.730
Keeps the rain off my head.

08:09.144 --> 08:11.564
Okay. What am I looking for?

08:11.709 --> 08:13.494
All right.

08:13.529 --> 08:15.904
See that piss-poor rock hopper down there?

08:15.939 --> 08:18.168
He's trying to cover it up
with that baggy flight suit.

08:18.203 --> 08:20.998
See the way the skin hangs off his bones?

08:21.033 --> 08:23.454
You get the red eyes and the shakes

08:23.489 --> 08:26.372
when your body rejects the growth hormones.

08:26.407 --> 08:28.835
You also get that from a
little too much whiskey.

08:28.898 --> 08:30.786
Nah, tremors, man.

08:30.821 --> 08:33.417
That's from growing up in low-G.

08:33.452 --> 08:35.604
Your muscles don't develop right.

08:35.639 --> 08:38.967
I guess that's from
generations in low-G, huh?

08:39.001 --> 08:43.001
Someday, I'd say every Belter's
gonna look just like that.

08:44.903 --> 08:46.759
What about you?

08:46.794 --> 08:48.072
What about me?

08:48.174 --> 08:49.565
What's your tell?

08:49.599 --> 08:51.555
Let me help you with that, inyaloda.

08:51.590 --> 08:55.060
This one, he has spurs
at the top of his spine

08:55.095 --> 08:56.893
where the bones didn't fuse right.

08:56.928 --> 08:59.805
He got the cheap bone density
juice when he was a child.

08:59.840 --> 09:02.051
Probably a ward of the station.

09:02.086 --> 09:06.122
So, even if he disguises
himself, he's just like me.

09:06.157 --> 09:09.228
I am nothing like you, longbone.

09:09.263 --> 09:12.739
Take your OPA bullshit back to the Medina,

09:12.774 --> 09:14.287
and wait for the revolution

09:14.322 --> 09:16.069
with all the rest of the victims.

09:16.104 --> 09:17.846
Please, why don't you go outside...

09:19.759 --> 09:21.002
Lunch break's over.

09:38.942 --> 09:40.119
Hey, voyu...

09:40.154 --> 09:42.052
Detective,

09:42.087 --> 09:43.591
I've been looking all over for you.

09:43.626 --> 09:46.917
Hmm. I trust you changed
those air filters, right?

09:46.952 --> 09:49.172
Full compliance, mi sa-sa.

09:49.344 --> 09:51.259
Good, good.

09:52.229 --> 09:53.564
Now arriving.

09:53.599 --> 09:55.751
- Mid-town level...
- No need to pay a visit, then.

09:55.786 --> 09:57.426
- Exit for Star Helix Police
- Excuse me.

09:57.461 --> 09:59.444
and Emergency Services.

09:59.499 --> 10:00.345
Come on.

10:11.019 --> 10:13.140
Okay, I'm gonna ask you one more time.

10:13.175 --> 10:15.150
Stop grinning like an idiot
and give me your real name.

10:15.185 --> 10:18.105
I promise you things will not
go well for you if you do not...

10:18.140 --> 10:19.336
- Jesus, Miller!
- Do you hear her?

10:19.371 --> 10:20.440
Miller! Hey!

10:20.475 --> 10:21.927
- Get the cuffs off.
- If I want his ass kicked,

10:21.962 --> 10:22.714
I'll do it myself.

10:22.749 --> 10:25.213
I know who you are! I'll find you!

10:25.248 --> 10:27.248
I'll find you! I'll find you!

10:27.283 --> 10:29.565
Any laws against beating up suspects?

10:29.653 --> 10:32.687
No laws in Ceres. Just cops.

10:35.175 --> 10:37.318
I have something for you.

10:37.773 --> 10:39.297
New contract.

10:39.395 --> 10:42.834
Just you. Not Havelock. He's too new.

10:43.552 --> 10:44.956
You sidelining me, Captain?

10:44.991 --> 10:47.459
No, this is off-book. On your own time.

10:47.525 --> 10:49.957
A favor someone down on Earth
is doing for a shareholder.

10:49.992 --> 10:52.261
Oh, we're groveling to
the shareholders now?

10:52.296 --> 10:53.625
I need someone discreet.

10:53.683 --> 10:55.565
Ah. Say no more.

10:55.638 --> 10:57.710
I've linked you into the files.

10:57.745 --> 11:01.368
A little lost daughter case.
Ariadne and Jules-Pierre Mao.

11:01.417 --> 11:03.094
Mao-Kwikowski Mercantile?

11:03.129 --> 11:04.417
They're Luna-based.

11:04.452 --> 11:06.398
They do a lot of shipping through here.

11:06.463 --> 11:11.044
And they misplaced a daughter?

11:11.114 --> 11:13.895
Black sheep. Went to college,
got involved with a group

11:13.930 --> 11:15.903
called the "Far Horizons Foundation."

11:15.938 --> 11:19.333
Students. With big ideas and big mouths.

11:20.508 --> 11:22.839
Why do the parents want
her found all of a sudden?

11:22.874 --> 11:25.529
Probably got tired of her
embarrassing the old man.

11:25.564 --> 11:27.068
It's all in the files.

11:27.103 --> 11:28.103
Okay.

11:32.529 --> 11:34.753
So... So, what's my contract exactly?

11:34.788 --> 11:38.563
Find Julie Mao, if she's still here on
Ceres, detain her, and ship her home.

11:38.598 --> 11:41.689
Kidnap job. My pleasure.

11:43.989 --> 11:47.819
_

11:50.465 --> 11:54.040
So, what you gonna do with your bonus
check when we get this ice to Ceres?

11:54.087 --> 11:57.175
Well, I'm not gonna make the
same mistake as last time.

11:57.244 --> 11:58.846
Casino before brothel.

11:58.927 --> 12:00.071
You got cleaned out.

12:00.106 --> 12:01.883
Yeah. And let me tell you,

12:01.918 --> 12:04.493
brothels on Ceres don't
like extending credit.

12:04.536 --> 12:07.313
Bet I can load twice the ice
that you do in half the time.

12:07.348 --> 12:09.458
Am I smelling a wager, ke?

12:09.520 --> 12:12.632
Not yet. But I will drag my...

12:12.667 --> 12:14.393
Watch out!

12:41.400 --> 12:43.195
You're entirely too good at this.

12:43.230 --> 12:46.099
I told you, I've got no power
to get you promoted on this ship.

12:46.134 --> 12:47.678
Well, then I take it back.

12:47.713 --> 12:49.757
Standby for thrust correction.

12:49.809 --> 12:51.712
Warning. Gravity has...

12:55.555 --> 12:57.757
Holden, report to the flight deck.

13:00.531 --> 13:02.497
We never saw it.

13:02.756 --> 13:05.421
Sorry, cowboy, but we did.

13:05.456 --> 13:08.252
We got a code 22, Cameron
Paj. Can't find the XO.

13:08.287 --> 13:10.978
All right, all right, I'll hunt him down.

13:11.192 --> 13:12.852
Don't get dressed.

13:14.241 --> 13:15.912
Hey, Paj, how's the arm?

13:15.947 --> 13:18.594
Looking good. Still got
a few nerves, though.

13:18.629 --> 13:20.623
Shed's been telling me how
the prosthetic's gonna hook up.

13:20.658 --> 13:22.204
Well, you know that
naturally, the company'll try

13:22.239 --> 13:23.938
to screw you out of a good one, right?

13:24.002 --> 13:27.037
I've been signed on long enough
to get one with force feedback,

13:27.072 --> 13:29.417
pressure and temp
sensors, the whole package.

13:29.452 --> 13:31.306
I know. What you should
have is that new bio-gel

13:31.341 --> 13:33.022
they developed on the inner planets.

13:33.057 --> 13:34.027
Then you wouldn't need a prosthetic.

13:34.062 --> 13:35.501
It regrows the limb perfectly.

13:35.536 --> 13:38.047
Screw the Inners and their magic Jell-O.

13:38.082 --> 13:39.410
No offense, Holden.

13:39.445 --> 13:41.361
No, I'd rather a
Belter-built fake any day.

13:41.396 --> 13:43.118
That's 'cause you're stubborn as hell.

13:43.153 --> 13:44.901
No worries, Paj.

13:44.960 --> 13:46.507
Hey, I need some Z-PRO.

13:46.542 --> 13:48.082
Been cleaned out for two weeks.

13:48.117 --> 13:49.706
You're gonna have to count sheep, sorry.

13:49.741 --> 13:53.072
Oh, I do have something
a little stronger, though,

13:53.207 --> 13:55.207
if you've got the, uh, scrip.

13:55.427 --> 13:56.393
Nah.

13:56.467 --> 13:58.084
- No?
- No.

13:58.119 --> 13:59.300
Hey, seriously, Holden.

13:59.335 --> 14:02.216
you won't let them screw me out of an
arm, will you? I don't wanna used one.

14:02.251 --> 14:04.937
I'm just a clock-puncher like you, Paj.

14:05.648 --> 14:07.889
Hey! Hey, you seen the XO?

14:07.924 --> 14:09.176
No, sa-sa.

14:09.211 --> 14:10.565
Just follow the reek of whiskey.

14:10.615 --> 14:12.960
- That's not nice.
- It's the truth.

14:13.192 --> 14:15.286
You didn't sign the PRP.

14:15.321 --> 14:16.932
I didn't sign the what?

14:17.863 --> 14:19.373
It's the retrofit...

14:22.326 --> 14:26.159
It's the retrofit proposal to overhaul
this bucket before it breaks apart.

14:26.194 --> 14:28.237
- Ah.
- If Naomi says it'll happen,

14:28.272 --> 14:29.755
you can take it to the bank.

14:29.799 --> 14:31.834
Listen, kids, I've been
here longer than you.

14:31.869 --> 14:34.716
It's way cheaper for the company
to settle up with a few widows

14:34.751 --> 14:36.539
than to overhaul this old barge.

14:36.574 --> 14:38.427
The truth.

14:38.462 --> 14:44.148
Besides, the Cant is a legend for
her scars. Badges of endurance.

14:44.723 --> 14:46.528
Hey, do you have a pry bar?

14:48.277 --> 14:49.719
Make sure I get it back.

14:49.754 --> 14:51.191
Sure.

14:51.226 --> 14:55.560
You must tell me the amazing story of how
you managed to become a second officer.

14:55.769 --> 14:58.704
- My biggest failure in life.
- Look out below!

14:59.450 --> 15:00.750
Welcome to the rodeo.

15:00.785 --> 15:03.872
Ladies and gentlemen, please sit
back, relax and enjoy the ride.

15:03.907 --> 15:06.159
Ceres Station, here we come.

15:06.220 --> 15:08.270
Please adjust your tray
tables and seat backs

15:08.305 --> 15:10.162
into their upright and locked positions...

15:10.197 --> 15:11.531
Shut up and fly, would ya?

15:11.566 --> 15:12.565
You, too, Boo Boo.

15:12.600 --> 15:15.608
Okay, reverse thrust. B5...

15:16.321 --> 15:17.715
How are we looking, kids?

15:17.750 --> 15:19.449
It's easy as picklin' eggs, Hoss.

15:19.484 --> 15:21.410
Paj needs approval for a new arm.

15:21.445 --> 15:23.697
I gotta get XO on it. Have you seen him?

15:23.732 --> 15:26.725
If I said I had, I'd be lyin'.

15:30.551 --> 15:31.943
Hey, XO!

15:34.106 --> 15:35.106
Hey!

15:38.803 --> 15:39.879
All right, I'm coming in,

15:39.914 --> 15:41.653
and I don't wanna see anything hairy.

15:54.350 --> 15:58.002
♪ Daffodil

15:58.130 --> 16:01.130
♪ A daffodil ♪

16:04.684 --> 16:08.668

16:09.174 --> 16:11.082

16:19.786 --> 16:22.786

16:25.112 --> 16:28.076
You know what I just can't figure out?

16:29.833 --> 16:31.833
We make it all this way,

16:33.082 --> 16:35.911
so far out into the darkness.

16:39.907 --> 16:42.599
Why couldn't we have brought more light?

16:46.771 --> 16:49.395
I hear ya... Okay, come on, now, X.

16:50.511 --> 16:52.321
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

16:56.599 --> 16:59.456
Oh, my God.

17:07.031 --> 17:09.633
Just lay back, real slow, okay?

17:09.667 --> 17:11.339
What's that?

17:11.374 --> 17:13.101
Okay, everything's
gonna be fine, all right?

17:13.136 --> 17:15.827
Daisy, bluebell...

17:15.862 --> 17:17.865
Pull that tight.

17:17.900 --> 17:20.862
He started talking to his
plants about six months ago.

17:20.932 --> 17:23.146
I figured he would've
pulled himself out of it.

17:23.292 --> 17:25.292
So it goes.

17:26.044 --> 17:28.143
It's been a long time comin'.

17:28.875 --> 17:30.565
Are you kidding?

17:30.668 --> 17:32.515
No. I thought I was
getting my walking papers.

17:32.566 --> 17:33.532
What for?

17:33.599 --> 17:36.306
Well, fraternizing with
our navigator, for starters.

17:36.341 --> 17:37.818
What?

17:38.297 --> 17:40.624
Look, people like you.

17:40.659 --> 17:42.679
You get things done, and
you're gonna make a good XO.

17:42.714 --> 17:44.190
You got me pegged wrong, Captain.

17:44.225 --> 17:47.230
Captain's never wrong. First lesson, free.

17:47.296 --> 17:50.994
You've been on the Cant five years
now. Turned down two transfers.

17:51.057 --> 17:53.565
Face it, this is your
home. It's your family.

17:53.659 --> 17:54.815
Is this where we hug?

17:54.893 --> 17:56.427
So, why haven't you moved on, then?

17:56.480 --> 17:58.868
Because no one tried to
push an XO badge on me.

17:58.903 --> 18:00.198
I like things the way they are.

18:00.233 --> 18:01.565
Evolve or die.

18:01.599 --> 18:03.425
Then at least I'll die grinning.

18:03.475 --> 18:05.564
Don't be stupid. One of these days,

18:05.599 --> 18:08.266
Earth and Mars are gonna bury the
hatchet and hammer out a treaty.

18:08.301 --> 18:10.358
Yeah, and now you're dreamin', Cap.

18:10.393 --> 18:12.205
I'm a man of great vision. You'll see.

18:12.240 --> 18:14.212
Means we'll finally get out
of the ice-hauling business

18:14.247 --> 18:16.433
and into the Earth-Mars business.

18:16.488 --> 18:19.186
Less risk, way better reward.

18:19.410 --> 18:21.376
Maybe a chance to see Earth again.

18:21.416 --> 18:23.625
What makes you think I
wanna see Earth again?

18:23.660 --> 18:25.472
You a "wanted man" back in Montana?

18:25.507 --> 18:26.817
Maybe I am.

18:26.852 --> 18:28.941
Someday you'll tell me that story.

18:28.976 --> 18:32.565
Right after you tell me
the story about those.

18:32.658 --> 18:36.019
Well, those are, uh, mine.

18:36.167 --> 18:38.566
It's just... There's...

18:39.024 --> 18:40.438
I don't care about your past.

18:40.473 --> 18:42.253
Everybody on the Cant
is hiding from something.

18:42.288 --> 18:43.937
Yeah, I appreciate the offer, Cap.

18:44.019 --> 18:47.773
Hey, boss, we need you out
here. You gotta see this.

18:48.311 --> 18:50.174
Hang on to this for a couple of days.

18:50.209 --> 18:52.208
It might feel good in the pocket.

18:58.853 --> 19:00.770
Picked up a Mayday.

19:00.805 --> 19:03.644
Looks like a light freighter.
Calls itself the Scopuli.

19:03.679 --> 19:05.005
Anyone else in the vicinity?

19:05.040 --> 19:08.292
No siree, Bob, we are the only
ship in three million clicks.

19:08.327 --> 19:09.986
- Of course we are.
- Got it.

19:10.107 --> 19:13.439
Next to a charted, non-Belt asteroid.

19:13.474 --> 19:15.936
What the hell were they
doing way out there?

19:15.971 --> 19:17.794
We're obligated to check it out.

19:17.829 --> 19:20.403
I'm well aware of the statute, Ms. Nygaard.

19:26.839 --> 19:28.035
It's pirate bait.

19:28.070 --> 19:30.411
That far outside the shipping lanes?

19:30.446 --> 19:34.257
It's not far out of our way,
Captain. Two days at most.

19:36.724 --> 19:39.652
A delay means we lose our berth at Ceres.

19:41.353 --> 19:43.750
Kiss our on-time bonus goodbye.

19:44.700 --> 19:48.225
I say we move on and let the
good god Darwin sort it out.

19:50.599 --> 19:52.565
What goes around comes around.

19:52.661 --> 19:55.245
One of these days, it's gonna
be us stranded out there.

19:59.219 --> 20:01.525
Captain gave an order, people.

20:01.901 --> 20:05.245
Purge the logs. We never
received that signal.

20:06.152 --> 20:08.152
Set the watch and proceed.

20:13.474 --> 20:15.440
See, you're a natural.

20:15.907 --> 20:18.300
That was some real XO shit in there.

20:18.427 --> 20:22.611
No. That was me wanting to
get to Ceres worse than you.

20:28.811 --> 20:30.316
_

20:30.358 --> 20:31.677
_

20:39.764 --> 20:42.540
Thanks for backing me
up on that distress call.

20:42.762 --> 20:45.313
McDowell's got a nose for trouble.

20:45.386 --> 20:47.612
He's been doing this a
while longer than we have.

20:47.647 --> 20:50.743
I guess you really are
sucking up for that XO badge.

20:50.820 --> 20:52.075
Turned him down flat.

20:52.110 --> 20:54.076
You kidding me?

20:54.206 --> 20:56.341
You'd be on the short path to Captain.

20:56.409 --> 20:58.375
Exactly.

20:58.472 --> 21:02.910
Besides, if I took it, we'd
have to stop seeing each other.

21:03.698 --> 21:05.501
Well. You know.

21:05.572 --> 21:08.572
There's that saying about all good things.

21:12.188 --> 21:15.780
I told you. A couple more
rotations and I'd be moving on.

21:16.402 --> 21:18.524
A couple is...

21:18.559 --> 21:21.858
You know, two at least. I assumed.

21:21.935 --> 21:23.540
Hey.

21:23.743 --> 21:26.083
There's right now and there's later.

21:26.279 --> 21:27.804
Why worry about later, right?

21:27.878 --> 21:29.272
Right.

21:30.668 --> 21:33.026
Come on, Jim. Lie down.

21:33.955 --> 21:38.064
I promise I won't lay a finger on you.

21:49.112 --> 21:51.184
I can't sleep. I'll take over.

21:52.451 --> 21:53.749
I'll buy you a bottle on Ceres.

21:53.784 --> 21:56.784
I'll settle for a good cup of coffee.

22:38.567 --> 22:39.560
_

22:39.595 --> 22:41.411
_

22:41.446 --> 22:43.014
_

22:46.650 --> 22:49.654
_

23:06.083 --> 23:08.601
Please help me.

23:08.721 --> 23:11.273
Is anybody there? Please.

23:24.464 --> 23:26.361
Please help me.

23:36.291 --> 23:38.772
_

23:50.323 --> 23:51.697
Hey!

23:53.607 --> 23:55.195
How many times have I told you?

23:55.230 --> 23:57.389
This calls for tickling!

23:57.519 --> 23:59.158
No!

23:59.193 --> 24:02.992
No, please, no!

24:03.854 --> 24:05.621
He'll wet himself if you're not careful.

24:05.656 --> 24:08.713
That's the advantage
of being a grandparent.

24:08.748 --> 24:10.844
I get to hand him off to his mother.

24:19.255 --> 24:22.308
Amma, do you have to go?

24:22.418 --> 24:24.473
Yes, I do. I'm sorry.

24:24.565 --> 24:26.408
There's someone I need to talk to.

24:26.443 --> 24:28.463
Are people fighting again?

24:28.667 --> 24:30.413
Not yet.

24:31.066 --> 24:34.596
That's why we need to
talk, and tell the truth.

24:37.331 --> 24:39.629
When people don't tell the truth,

24:39.737 --> 24:42.148
it always ends badly.

24:53.302 --> 24:57.100
_

24:58.456 --> 25:01.245
You've been linked to a
radical faction of the OPA.

25:01.378 --> 25:03.198
Were you just a courier?

25:05.883 --> 25:07.891
- _
- How long has he been out of the tank?

25:07.981 --> 25:09.539
Ten hours.

25:15.670 --> 25:19.183
I'm sorry the gravity
of a real planet hurts.

25:19.218 --> 25:21.323
But it's appropriate.

25:21.397 --> 25:23.539
You wish to hurt Earth.

25:23.708 --> 25:27.877
The Earth that is now crushing
your weak Belter lungs,

25:27.912 --> 25:31.104
and your fragile Belter bones.

25:31.690 --> 25:35.483
All you have to do to make it stop is talk.

25:36.486 --> 25:38.539
You're an OPA terrorist.

25:38.619 --> 25:41.833
You were carrying contraband
stealth technology.

25:42.057 --> 25:44.057
What was it for?

25:47.198 --> 25:51.776
A whisper will do, if
that's all you can manage.

25:52.916 --> 25:54.916
Hey.

25:59.276 --> 26:01.606
Give him another 10 hours.

26:02.820 --> 26:05.125
If he survives, call me.

26:15.654 --> 26:18.632
Now arriving, Medina Exchange District.

26:23.228 --> 26:24.816
Everybody calm down, all right!

26:24.851 --> 26:25.781
Back away.

26:25.816 --> 26:27.539
Back up, people!

26:37.712 --> 26:39.333
Hey! Back up, buddy,

26:39.368 --> 26:41.077
I'm talking to you!

26:41.478 --> 26:42.431
What's up, doll?

26:42.466 --> 26:44.066
Cheap-ass air filters crapped out.

26:44.101 --> 26:45.364
Second time this month.

26:47.967 --> 26:51.233
I guess this guy pays well
to be taken care of, huh?

26:51.808 --> 26:54.868
Yeah, he pays our bosses
pretty well, too, pal.

26:54.977 --> 26:58.299
Look, don't try to save the
whole station on your first day.

26:58.363 --> 26:59.920
Pace yourself.

27:02.941 --> 27:04.424
Any rain yet?

27:07.526 --> 27:10.590
That distress call we never received,

27:10.625 --> 27:12.864
it was logged with HQ.

27:12.942 --> 27:15.978
By some anonymous, piece-o'-shit
do-gooder aboard this ship.

27:16.013 --> 27:17.451
Well, at least somebody has a soul.

27:17.486 --> 27:18.825
I swear, I find the rat...

27:18.860 --> 27:20.909
Quit lookin' at me, Byers,
or I'll put your lights out.

27:20.944 --> 27:22.200
Any ol' time, girl.

27:22.235 --> 27:25.948
Now, we're forced to divert, or
the firm's legally on the hook.

27:26.034 --> 27:27.485
Holden.

27:27.733 --> 27:30.480
You'll head up this rescue, or salvage,

27:30.527 --> 27:32.493
whatever we're calling it.

27:32.530 --> 27:34.705
Put a shuttle team together.

27:37.651 --> 27:39.262
There a problem, XO?

27:39.370 --> 27:42.328
Acting XO, sir.

27:47.121 --> 27:49.110
I ain't goin'. No way, no how.

27:49.145 --> 27:51.020
Well, you ain't invited.

27:51.055 --> 27:53.163
Alex, ping the beacon that we're on our way

27:53.198 --> 27:55.188
and let Ceres know that
we're gonna be late.

27:55.223 --> 27:56.387
Ms. Nygaard?

27:56.422 --> 27:58.008
If we flip right now and burn like hell,

27:58.043 --> 28:00.174
I can get us within 50,000 clicks.

28:00.209 --> 28:02.414
Oh, great. Then we'll all be
puking in our crash-couches

28:02.449 --> 28:04.527
while the cargo busts
loose and scuttles the ship.

28:04.562 --> 28:06.658
Make sure that ice stays put.

28:06.693 --> 28:09.488
Naomi. How's the Knight looking?

28:09.554 --> 28:11.926
She's one leaky lifeboat.

28:11.961 --> 28:14.623
She should be able to manage
50,000 clicks of vacuum.

28:14.682 --> 28:16.477
All right, then you're on board.

28:21.580 --> 28:23.200
This is Holden.

28:23.284 --> 28:28.250
We've logged a distress
call near CA-2216862.

28:28.316 --> 28:30.773
We're obliged to change
our course and respond.

28:30.808 --> 28:33.391
Make sure your acceleration
drug dispensers are full.

28:33.426 --> 28:37.126
This will be a high-G maneuver.
Prepare for flip and burn.

28:52.800 --> 28:54.905
Here comes the juice.

30:27.348 --> 30:31.247
I can't figure out why Cap would put
you in charge of this little excursion.

30:31.374 --> 30:32.939
Well, he still thinks he's grooming me

30:32.974 --> 30:34.516
for bigger things.

30:34.599 --> 30:36.686
Then he's wasting his time.

30:36.721 --> 30:39.347
That's what I keep telling him.

30:42.691 --> 30:45.934
If your girlfriend
logged that distress call,

30:46.077 --> 30:48.929
she's gonna be living
it down for a long time.

30:55.327 --> 30:56.826
I did it.

31:02.591 --> 31:04.558
I just couldn't shake it.

31:06.944 --> 31:09.944
I'd keep that to myself if I were you.

31:15.661 --> 31:18.726
What's the good word, y'all?

31:18.898 --> 31:20.407
All right.

31:20.537 --> 31:23.357
How's my sweet old rust bucket today?

31:23.529 --> 31:25.933
Well, I guess we'll find out, won't we?

31:25.989 --> 31:27.446
I guess so.

31:29.450 --> 31:30.988
Okay.

31:34.517 --> 31:36.908
So just for the record, guys,

31:36.943 --> 31:38.530
I don't wanna be here right now.

31:38.592 --> 31:41.415
Me neither. But here we are.

31:41.462 --> 31:43.551
One big, happy unit.

31:43.693 --> 31:45.557
Knight, your flight plan is set.

31:45.622 --> 31:48.165
It'll be a two-hour trip to
the tango, flying tea-kettle.

31:48.234 --> 31:49.938
Thank you, Canterbury.

31:49.973 --> 31:52.577
Welcome, Knight. Godspeed.

31:52.612 --> 31:55.827
If you see anything that seems off,
you pack up the toys and come on home.

31:55.904 --> 31:57.566
No heroes, Captain.

31:57.631 --> 32:00.660
Clear to leave the barn. Good luck.

32:29.599 --> 32:30.947
Really?

32:34.091 --> 32:35.825
She's off the clock.

32:36.334 --> 32:38.825
Then she can tell me that.

32:50.593 --> 32:52.238
I'd keep an eye on that guy.

32:52.273 --> 32:56.239
I hear he collects moon
rocks in his spare time.

32:56.428 --> 32:58.299
You wanna know what else he's into?

32:58.334 --> 33:02.724
Hey, hey, now. I'm just
lookin' out for you.

33:04.077 --> 33:06.077
I need a woman's intuition.

33:07.615 --> 33:08.471
Who is she?

33:08.527 --> 33:11.606
Oh, she's just a missing persons case

33:11.641 --> 33:14.401
I'm not "permitted to discuss," you know.

33:15.505 --> 33:18.128
Juliette Andromeda Mao.

33:18.217 --> 33:20.991
She's the richest
bachelorette in the system.

33:21.789 --> 33:24.340
Now what would a rich girl do

33:24.625 --> 33:27.612
to really piss Daddy off on Ceres?

33:27.670 --> 33:29.614
Are you asking what I did?

33:30.701 --> 33:33.471
Bang every space bucker I could find.

33:34.124 --> 33:35.807
That's not helpful.

33:35.842 --> 33:38.584
Oh, I'm sorry, Miller. Did
you come here for my help?

33:38.619 --> 33:40.309
Come on.

33:40.748 --> 33:45.643
Admit it. You miss me. You
miss these little chats.

33:45.717 --> 33:48.036
Good night, Miller.

33:55.124 --> 33:58.213
Eat something, for God's
sake. You look like hell.

34:11.199 --> 34:14.216
_

34:17.373 --> 34:20.143
Config matches the registry information.

34:21.217 --> 34:23.183
It's definitely the Scopuli.

34:23.373 --> 34:27.072
No IR or electro-mag other
than the distress beacon.

34:27.244 --> 34:28.551
Looks like the reactor's shut down,

34:28.585 --> 34:30.819
but no radiation leakage.

34:32.065 --> 34:35.676
What about that thing that looks
like a big hole in the side?

34:36.263 --> 34:39.576
Uh, LADAR says it's a big hole in the side.

34:42.233 --> 34:46.534
Well, the big array on the Cant's
reading no one within a million clicks.

34:46.570 --> 34:48.303
Looks like we're the only game in town.

34:48.369 --> 34:51.335
Well, we came, we looked, we, uh, left.

34:51.623 --> 34:54.152
No one's gonna know if
we set foot on that thing.

34:54.949 --> 34:56.867
_

34:57.396 --> 34:59.094
Take us in.

34:59.162 --> 35:02.245
And, Alex, if something
nasty's hiding in that ship,

35:02.280 --> 35:04.748
we bolt like hell and melt
anything behind us into slag.

35:04.783 --> 35:06.097
Good plan, Hoss.

35:06.132 --> 35:08.665
All right, I'll go in and poke around.

35:10.694 --> 35:12.476
I'll go with him.

35:28.982 --> 35:30.812
Good times.

36:07.154 --> 36:10.120
How do you think that happened?

36:10.396 --> 36:14.215
It wasn't a torpedo. A
breaching charge did that.

36:19.374 --> 36:20.709
Amos.

36:21.834 --> 36:23.834
Keep that gun out.

36:25.639 --> 36:29.694
Engineering first. I wanna
know why that reactor's offline.

36:44.834 --> 36:47.834
Reactor wasn't killed by the blast.

36:48.572 --> 36:51.343
Someone went through
the shutdown procedures.

36:52.865 --> 36:55.865
So, if everyone's dead, who turned it off?

36:56.287 --> 36:59.253
Well, it wasn't pirates.

36:59.374 --> 37:01.622
They wouldn't have left all that behind.

37:01.803 --> 37:04.479
And they left all the pressure doors open.

37:07.444 --> 37:09.444
So no one could hide.

37:14.045 --> 37:15.339
Six o'clock!

37:18.787 --> 37:22.243
Naomi, Shed, we need more eyes in here.

37:23.733 --> 37:25.733
All right. Meet us on the bridge.

37:42.428 --> 37:43.910
Hey, guys?

37:45.374 --> 37:47.340
Where are all the bodies at?

37:47.897 --> 37:52.976
Amos, cut out the data
core. We'll take it with us.

37:53.021 --> 37:54.592
Roger that.

37:58.535 --> 38:01.199
These panels are all dead.

38:01.271 --> 38:04.798
How are they sending a
distress beacon with dead comms?

38:23.149 --> 38:24.702
Does that look like a...

38:24.797 --> 38:26.330
Well, maybe not...

38:26.388 --> 38:28.971
If it was a bomb, we'd be toast.

38:30.849 --> 38:32.849
It's a transmitter.

38:36.626 --> 38:39.229
This must be the beacon that called us.

38:39.338 --> 38:41.136
Somebody planted it.

38:41.218 --> 38:43.218
Pirate bait.

38:43.694 --> 38:45.693
McDowell was right.

38:45.728 --> 38:50.220
Hoss, forwarding you an A-1
tight-beam from the Canterbury.

38:50.416 --> 38:53.807
Holden, a ship just
appeared near your location.

38:53.873 --> 38:57.634
How is that possible? You cleared
us out to a million clicks.

38:57.669 --> 38:59.982
It didn't show up on any of our scopes.

39:00.017 --> 39:04.140
We're setting you a rendezvous
point. Get the hell back here.

39:14.600 --> 39:15.911
Alex! Disengage!

39:15.946 --> 39:17.417
My pleasure.

39:19.519 --> 39:21.276
Disengaging!

39:31.308 --> 39:32.638
Where did that thing come from?

39:32.673 --> 39:35.105
Damned if I know! Just
suddenly, it was there.

39:35.140 --> 39:36.734
Stealth tech. Has to be.

39:36.769 --> 39:38.769
Who the hell has stealth like that?

39:40.287 --> 39:42.185
Mars.

39:55.438 --> 39:56.644
_

39:58.943 --> 40:00.884
That's more thinner to the mix, all right?

40:00.919 --> 40:02.103
All right.

40:02.168 --> 40:04.487
Hey, hey, you see that other one?

40:04.522 --> 40:07.102
- What was that?
- You got that other one with you?

40:08.116 --> 40:11.488
That's a cute kid. How old?

40:11.592 --> 40:13.099
Two and a half.

40:13.756 --> 40:14.953
Hi.

40:16.083 --> 40:18.069
How about you? Any kids?

40:19.546 --> 40:23.247
Yeah, no. I missed that boat.

40:46.881 --> 40:48.881
There you go, pal.

40:51.748 --> 40:53.748
My turn.

40:54.482 --> 40:56.651
My turn.

40:56.685 --> 40:59.402
Me turn, me turn!

41:08.901 --> 41:11.573
We had an understanding,
Detective! An arrangement!

41:11.608 --> 41:14.133
You can't just... It was a mistake!

41:24.265 --> 41:27.504
You made your point. I'm a changed man!

41:27.621 --> 41:29.611
Thank you for opening my eyes!

41:34.130 --> 41:35.769
Twice the money!

41:37.435 --> 41:39.411
I'll pay you double!

41:46.865 --> 41:49.588
Air is good, don't you think?

41:52.202 --> 41:54.201
Air is nice.

41:55.960 --> 41:58.662
Keep those filters clean, asshole.

42:01.918 --> 42:03.300
Knight, we have your rendezvous.

42:03.335 --> 42:04.713
Negative. Unable.

42:04.802 --> 42:05.690
Advise.

42:05.725 --> 42:07.823
Bogey is 12,000 clicks and closing.

42:07.858 --> 42:09.642
Holden, advise!

42:12.787 --> 42:14.022
Torpedo launch!

42:14.057 --> 42:16.402
We're gonna take 'em for a ride.
Alex, go around the asteroid.

42:16.437 --> 42:19.355
Run 'em! Now! Lead the
torpedoes into the rock.

42:19.390 --> 42:22.195
What is your situation? Please advise!

42:24.896 --> 42:26.808
Six thousand clicks.

42:27.374 --> 42:28.854
Five...

42:28.975 --> 42:30.587
Four...

42:31.099 --> 42:32.557
Three...

42:42.787 --> 42:44.570
Those weren't meant for us.

42:46.934 --> 42:49.621
Canterbury, burn like
hell, you've got incoming!

42:52.570 --> 42:55.595
Right 30, G-burn. Do it! Now!

42:55.705 --> 42:57.559
- Range?
- Two-four. Closing.

42:57.594 --> 42:58.914
Standby cargo door.

42:58.949 --> 43:00.442
Captain, eject the ice as a shield.

43:00.477 --> 43:02.010
We're on it! Stay off this channel.

43:02.045 --> 43:02.978
Ade?

43:03.013 --> 43:05.662
Ade, did Mac eject the ice?

43:05.697 --> 43:07.617
Did he eject the ice?

43:07.652 --> 43:10.466
You take a hit, you stay
calm. They just want the cargo.

43:10.501 --> 43:12.836
We'll SOS, start negotiations
for prisoner release, okay?

43:12.871 --> 43:13.795
- Just...
- Jim.

43:13.864 --> 43:16.307
There's something you should know...

43:48.334 --> 43:49.972
She's gone.

44:01.287 --> 44:02.732
They nuked her.

44:05.459 --> 44:07.017
She's gone.
