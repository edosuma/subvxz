They're dark and creepy.

00:25.567 --> 00:27.110
Here's a lighter gray.

00:27.610 --> 00:29.487
Should we get some white, too?

00:31.239 --> 00:32.782
Kind of, help age it?

00:32.866 --> 00:34.784
-Get some what?
-[Robert] White.

00:35.410 --> 00:38.455
[Robert] I was thinking of getting this
to hang something in the tree.

00:40.915 --> 00:42.250

02:36.489 --> 02:40.952
I think, when I first took office,
I was ambitious,

02:41.035 --> 02:42.328
and...

02:42.912 --> 02:45.707
the city kind of gave me
a different attitude a little bit,

02:45.790 --> 02:49.043
but I was under the mindset
that I was gonna go in there

02:49.127 --> 02:53.047
and do some things and were...
and we were gonna do some things,

02:53.131 --> 02:55.884
and make some things... changed
and better for the city.

02:55.967 --> 02:58.261
I tell you,
I'm not feeling great right now,

02:58.344 --> 03:01.222
because I'm not happy
with the numbers in this city.

03:01.806 --> 03:05.685
I was hoping we would hit
at least a 50% reduction in crime.

03:05.768 --> 03:07.812
And then we hit a spike last week,

03:07.896 --> 03:09.939
and we had about six or seven homicides.

03:10.023 --> 03:13.401
It just blew my mind,
to be honest with you.

03:13.943 --> 03:16.905
I thank God
for the resources that we do have.

03:17.530 --> 03:19.866
I pray to God
we don't lose those resources,

03:19.949 --> 03:22.744
because if we do,
I can see a burnout coming.

03:22.827 --> 03:23.995
Let me put it like that.

03:24.078 --> 03:27.373
You can only pull somebody so far
before they start getting burnt out.

03:27.457 --> 03:31.252
We're gonna keep pushing, but it's not
gonna get done without you guys' support.

03:31.336 --> 03:33.087
We appreciate everything you do.

03:33.171 --> 03:35.048
We're gonna keep doing the best we can

07:18.980 --> 07:21.816
The one thing that can help fix
Flint's problems is money.

07:25.528 --> 07:30.116
The finances here are not up to par
quite yet, hence the police millage.

07:32.160 --> 07:34.787
So if the millage doesn't pass,
it's possible

07:34.871 --> 07:38.124

-Yes.

08:06.903 --> 08:10.615

08:12.742 --> 08:15.328
[officer] Yes, if you're in support
for police and fire.

08:15.411 --> 08:19.832

a reduction in the public safety force.

[Drew] <i>Flint certainly does have</i>

08:24.045 --> 08:27.548

08:31.844 --> 08:33.596
[Jessica] The millage before this,

08:33.679 --> 08:37.725
there was some accusations
of mismanagement of funds,

08:37.808 --> 08:40.895
which again,
the City of Flint has had issues there.

08:42.563 --> 08:44.899
<i>I'm not totally convinced it will pass.</i>

08:46.692 --> 08:51.948
Remember, we still can't drink the water,
so this skepticism goes far and wide,

08:52.031 --> 08:55.159
and I don't think the millage
is immune to that.

08:56.994 --> 09:01.999
[woman] <i>There's absolutely no</i>
<i>logical reason to vote for this millage,</i>

09:02.083 --> 09:04.085

<i>It never has in the 17 years</i>
<i>I've lived here.</i>

09:06.420 --> 09:08.464
[Kevin] Well, I can say, five years ago,

09:08.548 --> 09:10.758
I didn't endorse it,
as they wouldn't give me a number

09:10.841 --> 09:13.052
as the president of
the Police Officers Association.

09:13.135 --> 09:14.637
But I'm gonna tell you the truth.

09:14.720 --> 09:18.182
If we do not renew this millage,
we're gonna lay off 17 to 20 officers.

09:18.266 --> 09:21.936
[woman] It won't hurt me. I don't have
any police in my neighborhood anyways.

09:22.019 --> 09:25.398
Nothing's gonna change.
Nothing, for any of it.

09:25.481 --> 09:28.776
[Kevin] I disagree. Then I'm wasting
my time if you don't think like that.

09:28.859 --> 09:33.531
[woman] You are. I will never gonna vote
for another police millage.

09:33.614 --> 09:37.285
-[Kevin] I know, it's disgusting.
-[woman] You know what? I gave up.

09:37.368 --> 09:38.286
[Kevin] Don't give up.

09:38.369 --> 09:39.537
[woman] We're looking at,

09:39.620 --> 09:42.999
when do we let this house go
into foreclosure and get the fuck out?

09:43.082 --> 09:44.875
[Kevin] Then we disagree again.

10:05.896 --> 10:10.401
[Kincaid] I can almost verbatim say
what they were saying when they came in,

10:10.484 --> 10:12.737
is, "We're gonna hire
ten police officers."

10:12.820 --> 10:14.947
-[Kincaid] Remember that?
-[all] Yeah.

10:15.031 --> 10:16.991
They never hired ten police officers.

10:17.366 --> 10:18.993
[woman] I've voted for the millage,

10:19.076 --> 10:22.330
and then I always hear,
"It went here, it went there..."

10:22.413 --> 10:23.623
Why am I voting for it?

10:23.706 --> 10:27.585
Right. But to answer your question,
honestly, I can't.

10:27.668 --> 10:31.005
Because we were not here in place,
and I don't know where the money went.

10:31.088 --> 10:34.759
I asked that same question, and I did not
get the answer that I was looking for.

10:34.842 --> 10:37.595
What I can tell you is,
up under this administration,

10:37.678 --> 10:40.014
the money's gonna go to public safety,

10:40.556 --> 10:42.224
because that's our lifeline.

10:42.308 --> 10:46.312
[woman] Are we gonna be guaranteed
that this is where our money's gonna go?

10:46.395 --> 10:48.064
Listen. You know...

10:48.147 --> 10:51.275
Do they ever do audits
of who's taking care of this money?

10:51.359 --> 10:53.944
That was my issue,
and I talked to the chief.

10:54.028 --> 10:55.613
But the bottom line is this...

10:56.781 --> 11:01.118
If we don't get the money,
we're gonna lose police officers,

11:01.202 --> 11:05.081
because there's no additional funds
to support the Police Department.

So be mindful and careful.

11:48.916 --> 11:53.003
Be aware of shit that's happening around
the world, please. Be aware of that shit.

11:53.087 --> 11:55.339

11:55.423 --> 11:58.843

that may be watching us down the street.

11:58.926 --> 12:01.345

so, be careful.

12:01.429 --> 12:02.930

-[man] Alright.

13:32.436 --> 13:33.979
-[Scott] Ready?
-[man] Yeah.

13:37.983 --> 13:40.277
[Scott] Sit right here
and kick your shoes off.

13:41.904 --> 13:45.157
Put your feet up there
so your socks don't get all wet, alright?

13:45.908 --> 13:47.910
Now, I'm asking
because you're going downtown -

13:47.993 --> 13:49.620
you got anything in your crotch?

13:49.703 --> 13:51.997
-No, you can check.
-[Scott] Alright.

13:55.709 --> 14:00.381
[Scott] <i>Trust and honesty. It will</i>
<i>take you a long way in police work.</i>

14:00.923 --> 14:02.508
Slide in there.

14:04.718 --> 14:07.846
<i>I've been around this,</i>
<i>you know, my entire life.</i>

14:08.764 --> 14:12.017
My mom lives here in the city.
My grandmother lives here in the city.

14:12.101 --> 14:15.771
You know, I grew up here, and I want
to make a difference, you know?

14:17.690 --> 14:19.650
I'm smelling weed somewhere.

14:19.733 --> 14:24.738
<i>But sometimes it feels like</i>
<i>you're just treading in mud.</i>

14:26.323 --> 14:28.450
The citizens have to be able to trust

14:28.534 --> 14:31.036
that what you say is what you're gonna do,

14:31.120 --> 14:34.665
because you know, you made them
pay more for street lights,

14:34.748 --> 14:37.042
and then a lot of lights
still weren't working.

14:38.335 --> 14:41.714
You made them pay for police,
and then you didn't hire any.

14:42.256 --> 14:43.799
Yeah, you're under arrest

14:43.883 --> 14:47.553
for possession of crack, codeine,
and possession of marijuana.

14:47.636 --> 14:49.430
[man] Damn, they're going to the dumpster?

14:49.513 --> 14:50.598
[Scott] Yeah.

14:51.015 --> 14:53.017
Alright, sit tight for a minute.

14:53.100 --> 14:55.811
<i>And you still made people</i>
<i>pay for the water!</i>

14:55.895 --> 14:59.982
It's like, how can you expect them
to trust you?

15:01.567 --> 15:05.613
I don't have an answer for you,
but you don't want to go backwards.

15:06.030 --> 15:07.781
You don't want to go backwards.

15:12.620 --> 15:17.458
[cars on freeway]

15:30.596 --> 15:35.267
[Tim] <i>Right now, we're asking the citizens</i>
<i>in this city to pass a millage.</i>

15:35.893 --> 15:37.102
<i>Citizens are upset.</i>

15:37.770 --> 15:40.314
<i>We're really unsure</i>
<i>how they're gonna vote.</i>

15:40.397 --> 15:43.734
And our finances in this department
was, of course,

15:43.817 --> 15:45.736
at the lowest level it could possibly be.

15:45.819 --> 15:46.862
I had to take control.

15:46.946 --> 15:51.450
[pulsing music playing]

15:51.533 --> 15:54.828
[Tim] <i>First of all, we have a lot</i>
<i>of weapons downstairs in our armory.</i>

15:54.912 --> 15:56.956
In the hundreds of thousands of dollars.

15:58.040 --> 15:59.208
[woman] Put those in there.

15:59.291 --> 16:02.586
[Tim] <i>Michigan's a gun carrying state.</i>
<i>We have brand new weapons there.</i>

16:03.462 --> 16:07.424
<i>We have weapons down there that's anywhere</i>
<i>from seven to ten thousand dollars apiece</i>

16:07.508 --> 16:09.426
<i>brand spanking new.</i>

16:12.179 --> 16:15.140
It would be senseless to take
those weapons and destroy them

16:15.224 --> 16:19.228
when they can be sold to bring revenue
back to this financially strapped city.

16:22.189 --> 16:25.109
Yeah, we're gonna sell them
to the highest bidder.

16:25.192 --> 16:27.987
"Two, four, one, four, eight."

16:28.070 --> 16:29.738
"Charles 3539."

16:30.698 --> 16:34.243
"Thirty-aught-six. Romarm."
R, O, M, A, R, M.

16:35.369 --> 16:38.372
Everything down there that can be sold
is gonna be sold.

16:38.455 --> 16:41.667
[woman] OK, tag number is 36917.

16:41.750 --> 16:43.585
Everything, everything.

16:44.878 --> 16:48.632
[Devon] <i>Any dollars</i>
<i>that are in the police budget</i>

16:48.716 --> 16:50.426
<i>are critical dollars.</i>

16:50.509 --> 16:52.052
<i>There's no surplus.</i>

16:54.513 --> 16:58.392
<i>This is not the Police Department</i>
<i>selling guns to the community.</i>

16:58.475 --> 17:01.645
<i>This is the Police Department putting guns</i>

17:01.729 --> 17:05.816
<i>in the hands of people who are licensed</i>

17:05.898 --> 17:07.276
<i>to sell firearms.</i>

17:08.527 --> 17:12.698
People who, statistically, aren't gonna
do anything negative with them.

17:13.656 --> 17:17.161
I don't know a whole lot.
They do not want it publicized.

17:17.243 --> 17:20.039
I know that, and I understand.

17:20.830 --> 17:24.542
<i>Because if that's your kid</i>
<i>that was killed with that gun,</i>

17:24.626 --> 17:27.337
<i>there's an emotional attachment to that.</i>

17:27.421 --> 17:30.049
It's a weird, very touchy subject.

17:30.591 --> 17:33.177
But if it's gonna keep
police officers' jobs

17:33.260 --> 17:35.304
and free up space
to bring in new evidence,

17:35.387 --> 17:40.017
sometimes the touchy, feely part
has to get tossed, unfortunately.

17:42.144 --> 17:43.562
[Tim] <i>This is a gun carrying state.</i>

17:43.645 --> 17:47.316
<i>The citizens in Flint need to have</i>
<i>an option to buy the guns.</i>

17:48.525 --> 17:50.235
Bottom line is, when I get finished,

17:50.319 --> 17:52.738
this department
is gonna be self-sustainable,

17:52.821 --> 17:54.823
to where it's gonna be able to operate

17:54.907 --> 17:58.243
without going to the citizens
and always asking for more money.

17:58.327 --> 18:01.955
And it's getting ready to get that.
It's getting ready to get it.

18:05.292 --> 18:07.252
[gunshots]

18:12.841 --> 18:15.969
[Lewis] <i>Every time we come out here,</i>
<i>it's super cold.</i>

18:17.012 --> 18:18.806
<i>This is Michigan for you.</i>

18:19.932 --> 18:21.183
I feel good.

18:24.019 --> 18:24.853
Hey!

18:24.937 --> 18:26.688
[Lewis laughs]

18:28.148 --> 18:29.942
[cameraman] Are they shooting that close?

18:30.025 --> 18:34.404
I think they go, like, 21 feet,
16 feet, and 12.

18:34.488 --> 18:36.031
That's what I did for my class.

18:36.907 --> 18:40.410
[instructor] Anyone that's not loaded up,
load up two five-round magazines.

18:41.203 --> 18:43.413
[Lewis] <i>I've never shot a gun in my life.</i>

18:43.997 --> 18:48.168
<i>It wasn't no fighting, fist fighting</i>
<i>or shooting and stabbing back in the day.</i>

18:48.252 --> 18:51.505
It was all about singing,
and that's how we battled each other.

18:51.588 --> 18:53.882
<i>Like, "I bet you</i>
<i>our group could whoop yours."</i>

18:53.966 --> 18:58.345
<i>And the ladies would say, "They sound</i>
<i>better than the Southside group."</i>

18:58.428 --> 19:01.306
"We're gonna get you next week."
Man, that was beautiful.

19:04.434 --> 19:06.562
I was shocked at the CPL training.

19:06.645 --> 19:09.731
I mean, they freaking pass anybody.

19:09.815 --> 19:12.568
I mean, there was some people
I was on the range with,

19:12.651 --> 19:14.444
and I'm like,
"Are you kidding right now?"

19:14.528 --> 19:15.362
I know.

19:15.863 --> 19:18.448
[instructor] When you're gripping the gun,
it shakes.

19:18.532 --> 19:21.285
-[instructor] Are you squeezing too hard?
-[Lewis] Yeah.

19:21.368 --> 19:24.288
[instructor] Because, let me show you.
You're anticipating.

19:24.371 --> 19:28.083
I'm watching the muzzle come down
every time, almost, before you fire, OK?

19:28.167 --> 19:29.793
[Lewis] OK, alright. Thanks.

19:32.504 --> 19:35.215
-[Jessica] Sixty-five years old?
-Sixty-five years old.

19:35.299 --> 19:36.383
[Jessica] Why do this?

19:36.466 --> 19:38.802
I want to do whatever it takes
to bridge the gap

19:38.886 --> 19:42.264
between the community
and the police department.

19:42.347 --> 19:44.725
So, whatever it takes to help,
I'm gonna do it.

19:44.808 --> 19:48.437
[Jessica] <i>The number of officers</i>
<i>has gone down over the years by a lot.</i>

19:48.520 --> 19:51.565
I've seen it where the Police Department
had over 500 people.

19:51.648 --> 19:54.651
Now, down to 108.
So it's been a big change.

19:54.985 --> 19:57.070
[Jessica] <i>He's one of dozens</i>
<i>who have volunteered</i>

19:57.154 --> 19:59.656
<i>to get the job done this Halloween.</i>

19:59.740 --> 20:02.618
<i>In the past,</i>
<i>October 31st and the night before</i>

20:02.701 --> 20:05.787
<i>see a spike in crime and arsons in Flint.</i>

20:05.871 --> 20:07.915
[man] <i>We don't have</i>
<i>enough police officers.</i>

20:07.998 --> 20:10.500
This is a time where the citizens
need to step up

20:10.584 --> 20:12.252
and try to fill the void.

20:13.629 --> 20:15.005
[gunshot echoes]

20:15.756 --> 20:19.301
[kids chattering]

20:20.677 --> 20:24.348
[crows cawing in trees]

20:29.978 --> 20:33.398
[pulsing music playing]

20:47.829 --> 20:50.958
[woman] Can you pull over
so I can talk to you for a minute?

20:51.833 --> 20:53.543
I live in Shiloh Commons.

20:53.627 --> 20:57.589
We are flooded right now
with the crackheads and the drug dealers.

20:58.131 --> 21:02.010
Everybody has called downtown
I don't know how many times.

21:02.928 --> 21:06.473
It's to the point now where our kids...
They put a new park down there.

21:06.556 --> 21:10.394
They can't even walk down the street,
let alone to the bus stop in the morning.

21:10.477 --> 21:12.729
-Who do we call?
-[Keith] You're talking to him.

21:12.813 --> 21:15.440
You're talking about
right down by Shiloh Commons.

21:15.524 --> 21:18.277
[woman] Down on the end of Dewey,
down there by the post office.

21:18.360 --> 21:20.445
I stopped an officer before
and they told me

21:20.529 --> 21:23.365
the C.A.T.T. Squad was supposed
to be checking on.

21:23.448 --> 21:25.534
[Keith] Yeah.
And the C.A.T.T. Squad did...

21:25.617 --> 21:28.287
-How are you doing?
-We paid some attention to Dewey.

21:28.370 --> 21:31.248
We've actually raided two houses
on the street so far.

21:31.331 --> 21:33.709
So it's a work in progress.
We'll get back on it.

21:34.876 --> 21:37.129
It's just sad how

21:37.212 --> 21:41.425
the drug dealers and the drug addicts
have basically taken over.

21:41.842 --> 21:45.637
All the abandoned houses,
they came and took the boards off.

21:45.721 --> 21:49.308
They're living in the houses.
They went and got a bench from somewhere.

21:49.391 --> 21:50.892
Made a little front bench.

21:50.976 --> 21:52.769
-Where at?
-On Dewey.

21:52.853 --> 21:56.231
[Charman] Our kids right now, they have
no choice but to sit in the house

21:56.315 --> 21:58.775
and play a video game or watch TV.

22:01.445 --> 22:05.115
It makes you feel like
your kids are getting robbed.

22:11.830 --> 22:13.540
[Keith] What's happening?

22:14.916 --> 22:17.669
You can't rest that shit right here.
You've got to go.

22:17.753 --> 22:20.380
This isn't your house.
Why don't you clean this shit up?

22:20.464 --> 22:22.299
You're making it bad.
Whose bench is that?

22:22.382 --> 22:23.342
What?

22:23.800 --> 22:25.427
Whose bench is that?

22:25.510 --> 22:28.388
[man] I don't know where it came from.
I don't know.

22:28.472 --> 22:30.140
[Keith] What are you doing?

22:30.223 --> 22:31.892
[man #2 speaking indistinctly]

22:34.394 --> 22:36.313
[Keith]
You aren't using that shit in here.

22:37.981 --> 22:40.067
Get on down, man. You've all got to go.

22:45.238 --> 22:48.325
[Keith] <i>The people, are they pissed?</i>
<i>They are. They've got the right to be.</i>

22:48.742 --> 22:49.868
<i>I get that.</i>

22:51.119 --> 22:53.413
<i>But the timing is all fucked up.</i>

22:53.497 --> 22:56.041
Depending on how this millage plays out,

22:56.124 --> 22:59.961
I may be Officer Urquhart,
or I may be laid off, Keith.

23:01.213 --> 23:03.131
<i>But what do you do? What do you do?</i>

23:06.676 --> 23:10.680
Not to be discouraging, but you've
just got to be realistic about it.

23:11.348 --> 23:12.516
And do what you can.

23:12.599 --> 23:14.810
Because the little bit that we're doing,

23:14.893 --> 23:19.564
well, maybe her son can walk
down the street, clean, for two weeks.

23:19.648 --> 23:20.524
Maybe.

23:23.318 --> 23:24.611
I don't know.

23:26.988 --> 23:28.240
But we've got to do something.

23:31.785 --> 23:35.622
[cold wind blowing]

23:44.339 --> 23:46.550
[Bridgette] The best part
is just making the mouth.

23:46.633 --> 23:48.301
[girl] I'm gonna make mine look funny.

23:49.636 --> 23:51.763
[boy growls]

23:53.890 --> 23:57.310
[Bridgette] <i>Right now,</i>
<i>I'm so happy that I got moved</i>

23:57.394 --> 24:00.564
<i>into this position</i>
<i>in the Detective Bureau.</i>

[boy] This is the best pumpkin!

24:02.732 --> 24:04.860
[Bridgette] <i>I like my job.</i>
<i>I like my home life.</i>

24:04.943 --> 24:08.530
<i>And I hope it works out to where,</i>
<i>you know, there is no layoffs.</i>

24:11.908 --> 24:13.660
<i>I don't know what's gonna happen.</i>

24:14.494 --> 24:17.789
It would be interesting
if they lay off 30 officers,

24:17.873 --> 24:19.791
but you've got 30 reserves!

24:23.170 --> 24:24.629
Breaking even!

24:26.339 --> 24:29.634
[Bridgette] "Candance." It's so creative!

24:29.718 --> 24:32.095
[Robert] Looks like
it got shot in the face with a shotgun.

24:32.179 --> 24:33.263
[children laughing]

24:33.346 --> 24:34.639
[Bridgette] It's so creative.

24:35.098 --> 24:37.893
<i>He's gone through it before</i>
<i>several times,</i>

24:37.976 --> 24:40.520
<i>and not only is it,</i>
<i>like, financially hard,</i>

24:40.604 --> 24:43.815
<i>it's hard on you mentally and emotionally</i>
<i>to lose your job.</i>

24:45.692 --> 24:47.861
[Robert] <i>The citizens</i>
<i>are tired of the corruption.</i>

24:47.944 --> 24:51.239
And people at the top,
each time I've been laid off, are like,

24:51.323 --> 24:53.283
"They can't afford to lose any officers."

24:53.366 --> 24:57.370
Bullshit. They don't care about you.
They don't care about these citizens.

24:57.454 --> 25:00.957
They only care about making sure
that they have their money, period.

25:01.041 --> 25:03.335
They're bean counters.
You don't matter.

25:03.418 --> 25:05.962
Your family doesn't matter.
None of it matters.

25:06.046 --> 25:07.547
Money matters.

25:09.090 --> 25:11.801
-[Robert] I'll clean up.
-[Bridgette] Clean your plate, Abby.

25:11.885 --> 25:14.054
-[Robert] Got to get going.
-[Bridgette] Got to go.

25:17.682 --> 25:19.976
[Robert and kids scream]

25:20.060 --> 25:24.397
Tonight, arson is no stranger to Flint,
especially on the eve of Halloween.

25:24.481 --> 25:27.609
Devil's Night has been known
as a night of mischief.

25:27.692 --> 25:32.197
Fire officials were battling at least
two fires on the so-called Devil's Night.

25:32.280 --> 25:36.910
<i>Fire officials say the home was vacant</i>
<i>and they were able to put it out quickly.</i>

25:37.494 --> 25:38.787
[Bridgette] Having fun?

25:38.870 --> 25:40.538
[chainsaw buzzing]

25:40.622 --> 25:42.249
[terrified laughter]

25:42.999 --> 25:45.085
[thunder rolling]

25:45.168 --> 25:49.756
[all speaking at once]

25:53.051 --> 25:55.762
Alright,
the Halloween task force tonight...

25:55.845 --> 25:57.973
Thanks for being here.

25:59.432 --> 26:03.144
This is that heat map, the arson heat map
from the last 365 days.

26:03.561 --> 26:05.230
Just keep an eye on those spots.

26:05.313 --> 26:07.649
The green spots are busier than normal.

26:08.024 --> 26:10.026
We've got citizens radio patrols out.

26:10.110 --> 26:13.405
There's probably about 30 to 40 cars
out there that are volunteers.

26:13.488 --> 26:14.823
Anybody got any questions?

26:15.448 --> 26:17.033
No? Alright, get your cars.

26:21.871 --> 26:26.751
[tense music playing]

26:30.130 --> 26:33.174
[male dispatcher] <i> Twenty-nine 11.</i>
<i>Station 29, returning.</i>

26:33.842 --> 26:36.928
[female dispatcher] <i> Fire respond</i>
<i>on Flint fire road two,</i>

26:37.012 --> 26:39.097
<i>for mutual aid with a ladder.</i>

26:39.723 --> 26:42.017
[Wayne] <i>"Arson Night"</i>
<i>is what they should call it.</i>

26:42.100 --> 26:45.437
<i>It's more common than it used to be</i>
<i>because of the vacant houses.</i>

26:45.520 --> 26:47.856
It's a whole block.
A whole block is vacant.

26:48.273 --> 26:52.027
Vacant, vacant, definitely vacant...

26:52.694 --> 26:56.031
There was not a vacant on this street,
15 years ago.

26:56.740 --> 26:58.158
It was beautiful.

27:00.452 --> 27:04.414
[Lewis] OK, Lieutenant.
You too, now. Thank you.

27:04.497 --> 27:06.916
-[woman] Does he teach your classes?
-[Lewis] Yeah.

27:07.417 --> 27:11.212
[Lewis] Lots of volunteers out there,
riding around in their cars

27:11.296 --> 27:14.007
with the yellow lights on top of them.

27:14.090 --> 27:16.426
<i>And we go in all the neighborhoods.</i>

27:16.509 --> 27:20.096
<i>If anything looks suspicious,</i>
<i>we call it in on the radio.</i>

27:21.264 --> 27:22.682
Unit Ten to Base.

27:23.016 --> 27:26.936
The people that want to set fires,
when they see us coming they're gonna run.

27:28.938 --> 27:33.109
[man over phone] <i>There's a fire</i>
<i>down on Elliot Street. A house on fire.</i>

27:33.193 --> 27:34.903
[officer over radio] <i>Is it a vacant?</i>

27:35.236 --> 27:36.863
-[officer] Smell it?
-[officer #2] Yes.

27:37.781 --> 27:39.741
It looks like it's getting smokier.

27:40.950 --> 27:43.119
[man] On the next block over
it's pretty smoky.

27:45.872 --> 27:47.957
[officer over radio] <i>Mission accept. Copy.</i>

27:48.500 --> 27:50.460
[Lewis] We have a possible stolen vehicle.

27:51.252 --> 27:54.839
[woman] Now, they say first,
you make sure there's nobody around.

27:56.007 --> 27:58.385
This car was not made
for people with long legs.

28:00.303 --> 28:02.138
[Lewis] I've got to go to the bathroom.

28:02.222 --> 28:06.976
-[Lewis] Oh, Lord. Oh, Lord...
-[woman] Go across the street.

28:07.060 --> 28:09.896
[Lewis] Yeah.
I'm gonna go over there. Yeah.

28:09.979 --> 28:11.189
I've got to go.

28:11.272 --> 28:14.192
[dispatcher] <i>Which side of the street</i>
<i>is it on? East or west?</i>

28:14.901 --> 28:16.986
[officer] Is it hard working
the same shift as Dion

28:17.070 --> 28:18.988
and hearing what he's going through?

28:19.072 --> 28:22.325
-No?
-[Maria] No. I haven't... He can...

28:22.742 --> 28:26.162
He can handle himself. That's one thing
that we did in the academy.

28:26.246 --> 28:29.207
-[Maria] We only sat together...
-[officer] While feeding him lunch?

28:29.290 --> 28:30.417
[Maria] Feed him lunch?

28:30.500 --> 28:31.334
[laughter]

28:32.419 --> 28:37.507
That's my song right here. This is
the national anthem for police officers.

28:37.590 --> 28:40.552
["We Dem Boyz" by Wiz Khalifa
playing over radio]

28:40.635 --> 28:43.054
[sings along]

28:43.680 --> 28:45.932
[officer] So, what made you want
to be the police?

28:46.599 --> 28:50.061
I heard rumors that your mom
didn't have a babysitter.

28:50.145 --> 28:53.148
[Dion] Yeah! That was one of the rumors.

28:54.941 --> 28:57.652
I don't know, I just never found

28:57.736 --> 29:00.864
what was so interesting
about doing bad stuff.

29:00.947 --> 29:03.366
You get an adrenaline rush
from doing good stuff.

29:03.450 --> 29:04.743
That's enough adrenaline.

29:06.202 --> 29:09.164
[siren wailing]

29:09.998 --> 29:11.624
[engine roars]

29:11.708 --> 29:13.501
Where the fuck is this guy going?

29:14.836 --> 29:17.714
[dispatcher over radio] <i>A black male,</i>
<i>still headed westbound...</i>

29:18.298 --> 29:19.424
Son of a bitch.

29:19.507 --> 29:21.050
[siren wailing]

29:21.134 --> 29:22.510
Is he running now?

29:23.720 --> 29:24.846
Oh, he is running.

29:25.555 --> 29:26.973
There he goes.

29:28.266 --> 29:32.520
[woman] <i>People for so long</i>
<i>have wanted a certain kind of change.</i>

29:33.897 --> 29:35.315
But they're not seeing it.

29:35.398 --> 29:38.610
-[woman] Yes, I want something done!
-[officer] They shot your car.

29:38.693 --> 29:42.030
I don't think the police,
the government, the politicians -

29:42.113 --> 29:44.365
they don't give a fuck about you, no way.

29:44.449 --> 29:45.867
[officer] Hands behind your back!

29:46.826 --> 29:48.995
I think citizens,
they live in an environment

29:49.078 --> 29:51.790
where they're surrounded
by a bunch of other failures

29:51.873 --> 29:53.750
that contribute to the crime.

29:54.584 --> 29:57.921
[Scott] People shouldn't have to live
next-door to this.

29:58.004 --> 29:59.464
This is just unacceptable.

29:59.547 --> 30:01.341
[officer] Drop that knife!

30:01.424 --> 30:03.718
It just takes you
to a level of frustration

30:03.802 --> 30:06.554
where you're just...
almost throw your hands up.

30:06.638 --> 30:10.058
[man over phone] <i>Hey, we got a fire again.</i>
<i>It's the same house.</i>

30:10.141 --> 30:12.268
<i>Somebody burnt this motherfucker up again.</i>

30:12.352 --> 30:15.396
[operator] <i>OK, do you know</i>
<i>if anybody is inside it?</i>

30:15.480 --> 30:17.315
[man] <i>It's abandoned. It's by my house.</i>

30:17.398 --> 30:19.901
<i>I'm not trying</i>
<i>to let my house catch on fire.</i>

30:19.984 --> 30:23.029
[sirens wailing]

30:23.112 --> 30:24.906
This city is gonna go down.

30:27.408 --> 30:28.409
It's done for.

30:32.372 --> 30:34.207
It's gonna burn like hell.

30:37.043 --> 30:41.297
[ominous music playing]

30:43.424 --> 30:45.885
There's a bigger systemic failure

30:45.969 --> 30:50.056
that contributes complexity
to the job of what we do.

30:51.432 --> 30:52.600
<i>It's poverty.</i>

30:55.103 --> 30:57.856
<i>And yet, people still have</i>
<i>to try to find a way to operate.</i>

31:04.737 --> 31:06.239
[Wayne] <i> You get used to it.</i>

31:07.323 --> 31:10.201
<i>Not just as police.</i>
<i>As a community, you get used to it.</i>

31:12.871 --> 31:16.457
We can adapt to anything, and you will.

31:18.001 --> 31:22.547
[Brian] <i>And the police, we wind up being</i>
<i>the person that's called into the home.</i>

31:22.630 --> 31:25.383
And we hear about all the other ways

31:25.800 --> 31:28.511
that people are crying out
and reaching out to people

31:28.595 --> 31:31.764
who should be helping them...
who ignore them.

31:33.016 --> 31:35.018
We're citizens. We pay taxes.

31:35.643 --> 31:37.061
[Brian] <i>I don't fix street lights.</i>

31:37.854 --> 31:40.773
<i>The houses need to be torn down.</i>
<i>I don't do that.</i>

31:41.149 --> 31:43.234
Unfortunately, we pay water bills.

31:43.776 --> 31:48.072
Now, the downside of that is,
they expect you to solve all that stuff.

31:48.656 --> 31:50.116
What's taking so long?

31:51.409 --> 31:52.911
We just wait. We just wait.

31:56.456 --> 31:59.918
The Mayor... I mean, Dr. Weaver,
she didn't make Flint.

32:02.587 --> 32:05.924
The Police Department, the new chief,
he didn't make Flint.

32:06.382 --> 32:09.302
Flint came from the people
that's in Flint, you know.

32:10.553 --> 32:15.224
<i>If we don't try to band together</i>
<i>and make it a better place,</i>

32:15.850 --> 32:18.937
<i>then people have no reason</i>
<i>to do nothing but give up.</i>

32:22.815 --> 32:24.817
It's just the cycle.

32:26.569 --> 32:31.616
[melancholy music playing]

32:34.285 --> 32:39.624
It's the same reason that this duplex
is burning up right now.

32:39.707 --> 32:41.709
-Nobody lives there.
-Let it go down.

32:41.793 --> 32:44.712
-No taxpayers, is what I'm saying.
-[Wayne] Yeah.

32:44.796 --> 32:48.383
Just so you know, I will vote
for the millage because I'm a resident.

32:48.466 --> 32:49.342
Alright!

32:49.425 --> 32:53.471
And it just depends on who is gonna
slide me some cash to vote.

32:53.554 --> 32:55.765
I've been telling the rookies,
"If you want a job..."

32:55.848 --> 32:59.102
Right! That's the truth of the matter.

32:59.185 --> 33:00.979
Yeah. You want to keep your job...

33:01.688 --> 33:03.940
[firefighter] Without that millage,
we're screwed.

33:04.190 --> 33:07.777
Without it, we're decimated.
We're decimated.

33:08.486 --> 33:09.779
Yeah. We are, too.
