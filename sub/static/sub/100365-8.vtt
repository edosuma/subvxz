01:57.075 --> 01:58.785
-Please have some.
-Looks delicious.

01:58.869 --> 02:00.078
Thanks.

02:00.162 --> 02:01.205
Don't touch!

02:02.414 --> 02:03.790
Habibi!

02:06.835 --> 02:08.086
I'm not the dessert, Grandmother.

02:08.169 --> 02:11.465
Thank Allah. No one likes sour Jazaryieh.

02:13.634 --> 02:16.762
Now that everyone is here...
I have some news.

02:16.845 --> 02:18.805
He's burned the baklava again.

02:20.933 --> 02:21.767
Thank you, Father.

02:21.850 --> 02:24.561
With Allah's blessing, me and Lamma...

02:25.103 --> 02:26.647
Sorry to interrupt, Your Majesty.

02:26.730 --> 02:27.898
Is that a bee?

02:28.315 --> 02:31.818
It's work, sorry.
I told them I'd be free by now.

02:32.236 --> 02:33.904
So give it to us.
What is it, little brother?

02:33.987 --> 02:38.408
With Allah's blessing, me and Lamma
would like to get married next month.

02:40.410 --> 02:41.745
Wow! Congratulations!

02:42.496 --> 02:44.831
And when is it your turn, Rafiq?

02:45.874 --> 02:47.000
Congratulations, Bro.

02:47.084 --> 02:49.503
I'll make coffee.

03:00.931 --> 03:02.349
I'M HERE.

03:02.432 --> 03:03.934
WHERE ARE YOU?

03:18.240 --> 03:19.241
We're out of sugar.

03:19.992 --> 03:20.826
I'll go get some.

03:20.909 --> 03:23.287
Okay. Be quick. Your family's here.

03:51.231 --> 03:52.441
I thought you weren't coming.

03:53.108 --> 03:54.401
I heard someone.

03:58.822 --> 04:00.282
I'm glad you came.

04:01.658 --> 04:02.743
I'm Tamim.

04:42.074 --> 04:43.492
It's okay.

04:44.493 --> 04:46.787
You're allowed to enjoy this.

05:09.768 --> 05:11.728
Well, no wonder there's no sugar.

05:11.812 --> 05:14.022
Someone threw the whole bag in the trash.

05:23.657 --> 05:25.617
I'll be back in a minute.

05:46.847 --> 05:48.974
I still need to buy sugar...

06:01.820 --> 06:02.863
This is for your own good.

06:03.155 --> 06:04.531
Dad, no! Stop!

06:05.866 --> 06:07.034
You did this to yourself!

06:08.368 --> 06:10.871
Dad! Please! Please! Dad!

06:54.456 --> 06:55.582
Don't stir so hard.

06:55.666 --> 06:58.836
You want the eggplant to be buttery.

06:58.919 --> 07:01.213
And not like water.

07:02.506 --> 07:03.507
I'm here. I'm here.

07:04.049 --> 07:08.053
Your Highness, thank you for gracing us
with your presence today.

07:08.387 --> 07:11.306
What?
I didn't understand a single word you say.

07:12.349 --> 07:14.560
You know the rules.
I only speak English now.

07:14.935 --> 07:18.689
And what about my rules, Captain America?
You are late again.

07:18.772 --> 07:23.986
Ghazal... don't be mad at me.

07:25.112 --> 07:26.780
I beg. Forgive me.

07:27.197 --> 07:29.324
Stand up, stop it. Come on.

07:29.408 --> 07:30.742
Enough with the melodrama.

07:30.826 --> 07:33.287
You know you're
this close to being replaced.

07:33.370 --> 07:35.080
You know I'm irreplaceable, darling.

07:35.539 --> 07:36.582
Don't tempt me.

07:45.340 --> 07:47.759
So, you're the new guy?

07:50.971 --> 07:52.472
You got way more muscles
than the last one.

07:52.556 --> 07:53.557
Don't.

07:56.351 --> 07:57.352
I'm sorry.

08:09.239 --> 08:11.909
YOUR BROTHER IS LOOKING FOR YOU.
BE CAREFUL!

08:11.992 --> 08:14.536
Rafiq. Where are you going?

08:16.705 --> 08:17.748
Home.

08:17.831 --> 08:19.833
No, you're not. We're getting a drink.

08:20.083 --> 08:21.793
I thought
the last table was never gonna leave.

08:21.877 --> 08:23.545
I was this close to feeding them napkins.

08:23.629 --> 08:25.130
Sorry. I must visit my brother.

08:26.298 --> 08:27.925
I thought you were going home.

08:29.968 --> 08:32.010
I'm going to Le Piano. Come with me.

08:34.765 --> 08:36.600
Relax, habibi. I wasn't hitting on you.

08:39.394 --> 08:40.479
Homo.

08:42.356 --> 08:44.232
Is it always like this
when you walk around?

08:44.316 --> 08:46.318
-Always like what?
-Everyone is looking at us.

08:46.693 --> 08:47.945
And they're not even paying.

08:51.907 --> 08:52.908
No.

08:58.914 --> 08:59.915
Who's that?

09:01.124 --> 09:02.376
You mean my girlfriend?

09:04.253 --> 09:05.712
Wait. You're being serious.

09:06.588 --> 09:09.132
This is blasphemy. My queen.
You don't know Kelly Clarkson?

09:10.259 --> 09:13.262
Her lyrics are so deep. She won
American Idol. I'm sure you know her.

09:13.345 --> 09:14.346
I don't think so.

09:16.890 --> 09:20.644
I'll spread my wings
And I'll learn how to fly

09:20.727 --> 09:23.313
I'll do what it takes till I touch--

09:23.397 --> 09:25.148
Shut the hell up. People can hear you.

09:25.357 --> 09:28.110
Hey. Chill. I was just messing around.

09:28.402 --> 09:30.779
I don't want any trouble.
Please, just leave me alone.

09:39.288 --> 09:40.414
You're gonna go pray?

09:51.842 --> 09:53.552
Syrians are such hypocrites.

09:53.969 --> 09:57.181
It's illegal to be gay, but they love
to blow their long pipes in public.

09:58.015 --> 09:59.766
-You're crazy.
-Thank you.

10:04.146 --> 10:08.275
Seriously.
You're not afraid people will find out?

10:08.817 --> 10:11.028
Habibi, even pigeons know
which way I swing.

10:15.115 --> 10:18.577
Of course I'm scared.
If I could hide it, I would.

10:23.248 --> 10:24.625
I'm always afraid.

10:26.877 --> 10:31.423
That's why I come to DimaÅ¡q.
To hide.

10:35.802 --> 10:37.054
I'm hiding too.

10:38.096 --> 10:41.934
That's why I'm practicing my English.
I'm going to America soon.

10:42.434 --> 10:43.644
Wait, you're moving?

10:44.394 --> 10:47.356
I applied for asylum.
And I'm waiting on my papers.

10:48.315 --> 10:49.775
I'm gonna be a Hollywood star.

10:51.568 --> 10:52.778
That's so cool.

10:54.363 --> 10:55.864
What kind of acting do you do?

10:56.823 --> 11:01.078
Movies mostly, but I think TV for fun.

11:02.329 --> 11:07.584
I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine!

11:10.170 --> 11:15.300
I can jog all the way to Texas and back.
But my daughter can't.

11:16.218 --> 11:17.761
She never could.

11:18.679 --> 11:22.307
I'm so mad. I don't know what to do.
I want to know why.

11:22.391 --> 11:25.143
I wanna know why Shelby's life is over.

11:25.227 --> 11:29.356
I want to know how that baby will
ever know how wonderful his mother was.

11:30.148 --> 11:33.151
Will he ever know
what she went through for him?

11:33.735 --> 11:38.073
Oh, God. I wanna know why! Why?

11:38.156 --> 11:41.451
Okay, Sally Field. We like you.
We really like you.

11:41.827 --> 11:45.539
But the whole restaurant can hear you.
You are annoying the customers.

11:45.622 --> 11:46.623
They should be honored.

11:46.999 --> 11:48.083
Yalla.

11:49.585 --> 11:50.586
Zain?

11:51.503 --> 11:52.629
Habibi.

11:54.673 --> 11:56.425
-You have to meet my friend.
-Okay.

11:56.758 --> 11:59.636
Rafiq. Come out here.

12:01.388 --> 12:04.308
I'd probably be able to retire
if it wasn't for you two.

12:13.525 --> 12:16.612
This is Alvaro. He's visiting from Baghdad
for a couple months.

12:17.321 --> 12:19.072
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you too.

12:19.698 --> 12:21.992
We're going to one of the souks later
if you want to join.

12:24.036 --> 12:25.037
Sure.

12:26.496 --> 12:27.873
Again with this conversation.

12:27.956 --> 12:30.626
I don't know.
I mean, all the famous movie stars do it.

12:30.709 --> 12:32.336
You know, you get this pulled back.

12:32.419 --> 12:35.714
And then you get this clipped.
You get the nose done.

12:35.797 --> 12:37.174
You might as well just change your face.

12:38.383 --> 12:40.010
Just pick a completely different one.

12:40.093 --> 12:43.013
And actually, I was hoping
you'd pay for it as well. Yes.

12:43.096 --> 12:45.224
See? This is what it is.

12:45.516 --> 12:47.392
This is what it always comes down to.

12:49.728 --> 12:50.854
We're closing.

12:51.480 --> 12:52.814
But we're not done.

12:52.898 --> 12:54.274
Yes, you are.

12:57.236 --> 12:59.154
I got this. It's on me. Go.

12:59.571 --> 13:00.739
Yalla. Go.

13:09.998 --> 13:10.916
Are you all right?

13:11.500 --> 13:12.459
Not too bad!

13:14.962 --> 13:16.463
Run!

13:26.974 --> 13:29.059
Move. This is my song.

14:25.866 --> 14:27.451
Let me sleep!

14:32.039 --> 14:33.040
Zain?

14:35.292 --> 14:36.710
-Rafiq.
-Zain.

14:36.793 --> 14:38.504
What's wrong?

14:40.422 --> 14:43.217
-Don't come in to work today.
-Zain?

14:43.675 --> 14:44.885
What happened?

14:46.261 --> 14:47.262
Zain!

15:09.117 --> 15:11.245
What was the one thing I told you
over the phone?

15:12.913 --> 15:14.081
What happened?

15:14.164 --> 15:15.457
Your brother was here.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.126
They found you. You need to leave.

15:18.210 --> 15:20.796
They know where you work.

15:22.923 --> 15:24.216
It's as if God is punishing me.

15:24.299 --> 15:25.509
I'm so sorry, Ghazal.

15:25.884 --> 15:27.386
You're not the problem here.

15:28.303 --> 15:29.596
You need to leave. Now.

15:30.222 --> 15:31.682
Where would I even go?

15:31.765 --> 15:33.475
I have nowhere to go.

15:33.559 --> 15:34.768
Jordan.

15:34.852 --> 15:36.395
Jordan?

15:36.478 --> 15:38.438
I don't know anyone in Jordan.

15:38.522 --> 15:41.692
I know how scary this is...
but you're not safe here anymore.

15:43.026 --> 15:44.319
I don't want to...

15:48.073 --> 15:49.241
Don't be afraid.

15:56.456 --> 15:58.709
The UN can't protect you
in your own country.

15:59.209 --> 16:01.253
So we need to get you over the border.

16:18.770 --> 16:19.897
Thank you.

16:37.331 --> 16:38.415
I'll see you in America.

16:50.010 --> 16:52.179
Please fill in the countries
of your preference.

16:53.764 --> 16:57.017
Once you're there, you need to plead
your case to the UN for asylum.

16:58.685 --> 17:00.646
Make them see there's no other option.

17:01.813 --> 17:03.524
Then just wait for your papers.

17:05.400 --> 17:07.027
It could take a long time...

17:08.403 --> 17:10.239
but don't stop refreshing that page.

17:41.728 --> 17:42.813
Enjoy it.

17:42.896 --> 17:44.356
If you need anything else, call me.

17:44.439 --> 17:45.357
Thanks, darling.

17:45.941 --> 17:48.402
Rafiq. Habibi.

17:48.694 --> 17:50.028
Grandma?

17:53.323 --> 17:54.324
Shit.

18:00.539 --> 18:01.999
Sorry.

18:05.711 --> 18:08.088
I'm sorry. I'm such a muppet.

18:26.982 --> 18:29.109
Hey! I'm not done.

18:29.193 --> 18:31.778
Yes, you are.
No more internet until you pay.

18:31.862 --> 18:35.657
I get paid end of the week.
I'll get it to you then, I promise.

18:35.741 --> 18:37.034
Do I look like a charity?

18:37.117 --> 18:39.286
Do you think I run this shop
out of the kindness of my heart?

18:39.369 --> 18:40.370
Internet costs money!

18:40.454 --> 18:43.373
I just need five more minutes.
I'm almost done.

18:44.208 --> 18:48.712
You take your five, but you pay for ten
at the end of the week!

19:11.818 --> 19:13.403
I'll give you the rest on Friday.

19:13.487 --> 19:14.780
You're good.

19:14.863 --> 19:16.615
Did you have a stroke?

19:16.698 --> 19:20.327
Your balance is cleared.
You can thank your friend there.

19:27.251 --> 19:30.462
You didn't have to do that. I have money.
I pay for my own.

19:31.088 --> 19:32.256
I didn't mean to offend.

19:32.339 --> 19:35.509
I just wanted to apologize
for the mess I made at your restaurant.

19:35.592 --> 19:37.719
Yes. You come in
and make a lot of trouble.

19:39.638 --> 19:40.806
Fine, fine.

19:41.640 --> 19:47.312
If you want, you can invite me
to have a drink with you...

19:47.396 --> 19:49.523
...any time.

20:30.022 --> 20:31.023
Does it hurt?

20:34.568 --> 20:35.694
Not now.

20:37.112 --> 20:38.113
Was it from work?

20:41.867 --> 20:43.285
No. My father.

20:46.538 --> 20:47.831
Oh, my God.

20:49.791 --> 20:52.628
I'm sorry. It's barbaric.

20:53.712 --> 20:57.466
No, he thought he was protecting me.

21:00.219 --> 21:05.307
Growing up, they tell us being gay,
it means you go to hell.

21:06.558 --> 21:08.894
Not just you, but your mother also.

21:12.356 --> 21:15.567
When my father put my arm to the flame,
he told me...

21:17.569 --> 21:19.821
"This is what it feels for five seconds.

21:21.865 --> 21:23.283
Imagine eternity."

21:38.215 --> 21:42.636
Dear Rafiq. You'll never believe what I
can see behind these hazel eyes.

21:43.095 --> 21:44.972
I'm living the American dream, baby.

21:45.389 --> 21:47.474
Since you've been gone,
it's all happened so fast.

21:47.558 --> 21:50.018
I've been here for a few months
waiting for a moment like this,

21:50.102 --> 21:53.063
and it's very different than I expected.

21:53.146 --> 21:54.273
In a good way, I think.

21:54.606 --> 21:58.944
You'll be next. I know it. Don't give up.
And keep checking your status.

21:59.444 --> 22:02.239
Love, Miss Independent, AKA Zain.

23:20.275 --> 23:21.652
God is great!

23:28.033 --> 23:29.117
What is it?

23:29.201 --> 23:30.202
What's wrong with you?

23:30.285 --> 23:31.620
What happened?

23:31.703 --> 23:33.872
God bless you.
Look, you're a sexy, beautiful man.

23:33.956 --> 23:35.541
Hey! Hey!

23:37.292 --> 23:39.127
You still have to pay!

23:46.343 --> 23:47.719
Do you know anybody in America?

23:48.053 --> 23:51.849
Yes. My best friend, Zain.
He live here.

24:03.277 --> 24:04.570
Keep these with you always.

24:04.653 --> 24:07.573
I'd recommend putting them in plastic.
They're no picnic to replace.

25:17.392 --> 25:20.062
Yalla. Wait one second. Wait.

25:41.750 --> 25:43.293
You look like my grandmother.

25:43.585 --> 25:44.586
She wishes.

25:46.171 --> 25:48.048
Girl, you look like you just fled
your homeland.

25:49.550 --> 25:52.177
Take a shower. Come on. We're going out.

26:14.616 --> 26:15.617
Hey, baby.

26:17.077 --> 26:18.203
-ID.
-Hey, Sean.

26:19.621 --> 26:20.998
-ID.
-I don't have.

26:21.957 --> 26:24.126
Zain, where are you?

26:24.793 --> 26:25.878
Dude, you gotta move.

26:26.336 --> 26:28.839
-Please. I come with Zain.
-Next.

26:30.883 --> 26:32.050
Okay. You're good.

26:32.759 --> 26:34.052
Just one second. I--

26:34.136 --> 26:35.137
Come on, buddy.

26:35.220 --> 26:36.889
Hurry up! We've been waiting
for, like, 20 minutes.

26:36.972 --> 26:40.058
These are my papers. See.

26:40.642 --> 26:43.353
This is me. Rafiq. I am Rafiq.

26:45.898 --> 26:46.899
I've no idea what this is.

26:48.609 --> 26:49.443
Okay.

26:58.327 --> 27:00.162
Habibi, why are you out here?

27:00.245 --> 27:03.081
-Come on. Let him in.
-I'm sorry, no ID.

27:03.165 --> 27:04.166
Hold on.

27:09.379 --> 27:10.797
I have only my papers.

27:11.256 --> 27:12.257
Don't worry about it.

27:15.219 --> 27:16.512
Do you see a birthdate on this?

27:18.055 --> 27:20.015
-Yeah.
-Is he over the age of 21?

27:20.098 --> 27:21.016
Girl.

27:21.099 --> 27:22.434
-Yeah.
-Then he's in.

27:25.562 --> 27:26.396
Welcome, baby.

28:01.348 --> 28:02.349
Are you okay?

28:14.778 --> 28:19.408
All right. All right. All right.
That was Ms. Kiara.

28:19.700 --> 28:24.955
Ms. Kiara going deep inside
on the girls. I love it. I love it.

28:25.038 --> 28:26.623
Speaking of going deep inside,

28:26.707 --> 28:31.003
Mr. Alex, do you mind
if I reach deep inside your vase?

28:32.880 --> 28:38.844
And, okay. One of my favorites.
You know the one.

28:38.927 --> 28:41.555
All right. DJ Antwon, hit it.

28:45.267 --> 28:47.561
That's my song! This is my song!

30:07.850 --> 30:09.810
Hi, Dad.

30:09.893 --> 30:12.771
I'm safe. I'm okay.

30:13.021 --> 30:14.982
I hope you are, too.

30:15.315 --> 30:16.483
Rafiq.
