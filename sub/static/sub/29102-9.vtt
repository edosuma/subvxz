WEBVTT

01:27.045 --> 01:28.755
You keep hitting snooze,

01:28.838 --> 01:31.716
you ain't gonna win that Mickey D's
gift card for perfect attendance.

01:31.800 --> 01:34.719
They changed the prize to dictionaries
'cause of Michelle Obama.

01:34.803 --> 01:35.720
Ah, well,

01:37.222 --> 01:38.223
not everybody's perfect.

01:38.306 --> 01:41.684
Hey, hey! Uh-uh.  Put that back.
Don't eat that.

01:42.560 --> 01:45.188
Eat eggs. You need protein.

01:46.022 --> 01:47.357
I ain't eating this.

01:47.440 --> 01:49.734
There's red spots in here.
You givin' me period eggs?

01:49.818 --> 01:52.654
They ain't period, they're meat spots.
Make you strong.

01:52.737 --> 01:54.989
And get the bass out your voice
and eat what I made you.

01:55.073 --> 01:57.283
I liked you better
when you made chocolate chip pancakes.

01:57.367 --> 02:00.537
Well, I liked you better
when you talked less.

02:00.620 --> 02:02.997
Someone's been busy this morning.

02:03.373 --> 02:06.084
And don't just eat your toast.
You need protein.

02:06.167 --> 02:08.294
Mmm. That's what I was saying.

02:08.711 --> 02:12.090
You're both wrong. Coach says
to power-load carbs on game days.

02:12.882 --> 02:14.676
You remember to wash your uniform?

02:14.759 --> 02:16.636
-You didn't remind me.
-It's okay.

02:16.719 --> 02:18.763
I folded the laundry this morning.
It's in the basket.

02:19.180 --> 02:21.141
It's got that good dryer-sheet smell.

02:21.474 --> 02:24.519
Thank you, Cindy. But Monica's
supposed to do her own wash. You need to put some of that energy
into your job hunt.

02:28.064 --> 02:30.024
Uh, I already did. See?

02:34.404 --> 02:37.115
And I already got three more interviews
lined up today.

02:37.407 --> 02:39.075
Mom, I need you
to sign this permission slip

02:39.159 --> 02:40.785
so I can go to Family Life,

02:40.869 --> 02:43.163
even though all they do
is show dumb videos from the '80s.

02:43.246 --> 02:45.999
They still showing those?

02:46.082 --> 02:49.961
Oh, man, just wait till you see
the one about the cartoon cat

02:50.044 --> 02:51.963
rapping about how she got three holes.

02:52.630 --> 02:55.758
But... it's really important stuff.

02:56.885 --> 02:58.261
Bye, Cindy.

02:58.344 --> 03:00.763
Make sure you pay real close attention.

03:00.847 --> 03:03.766
-Mwah. I love you. Okay...

03:07.103 --> 03:10.023
Please tell me I was not that bad.

03:10.398 --> 03:12.734
Oh, you had a mouth on you, all right.

03:13.234 --> 03:15.069
And then there was that other thing.

03:16.112 --> 03:19.199
But, deep down, she's a good kid.

03:19.490 --> 03:22.452
Believe it or not, she was a lot worse
before you got home.

03:22.535 --> 03:26.039
So, whatever you're doing,
keep on doing it.

03:29.000 --> 03:33.421
I believe she's in some kind of cult,
and that one has a touch of the tism.

03:34.214 --> 03:36.925
I already told you, all guards here suck.

03:37.008 --> 03:38.176
Hellman's your guy.

03:38.259 --> 03:41.262
He-- He let me, he let me, uh,
transfer in here after I blew him--

03:41.346 --> 03:42.513
Fuck Hellman.

03:43.640 --> 03:45.099
He used to beat my ass.

03:47.018 --> 03:50.688
Uh, then, what about the black chick?
Like, about yea high?

03:50.980 --> 03:52.148
You mean the warden?

03:52.690 --> 03:54.776
If we don't find a guard-mule soon,

03:54.859 --> 03:57.153
then your mother and Hopper
are going to corner the market.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.197
How many times I gotta tell you
that bitch is all talk?

03:59.864 --> 04:01.783
Ain't nobody gonna want
their stepped-on shit

04:01.866 --> 04:03.660
once they get a taste
of what we're bringing in.

04:03.743 --> 04:09.332
Well, what about the guy who teaches GED?
The, um, the Asian one.

04:09.832 --> 04:12.919
It depends what kind of Asian.
Are we talking math nerd or <i>Tokyo Drift?</i>

04:13.836 --> 04:16.214
Uh, Filipino. And that's, like, racist.

04:16.297 --> 04:18.591
It's casual racism, not formal.
There's a difference.  This guy
don't look fast or furious.

04:21.552 --> 04:22.470
He's very handsome,

04:22.553 --> 04:25.765
but I have a rule not to sleep with
someone I could bounce off the ceiling.

04:25.848 --> 04:27.058
No one needs to be fucking anyone

04:27.141 --> 04:28.726
-named Elmer.

04:28.810 --> 04:29.769
Look...

04:30.728 --> 04:32.522
he's already bringing the books in. We just gotta get our own book.

04:35.858 --> 04:39.821
My girl slides the fenty patches inside,
and he won't even know that shit is there.

04:39.904 --> 04:42.156
This is a thoughtful plan.

04:43.241 --> 04:47.578
So, what's the difference
between the racisms?

04:48.288 --> 04:52.083
Capital-R racism implies
that the racist assumes racial superiority

04:52.166 --> 04:54.919
or performs deliberate acts
of discrimination.

04:55.003 --> 04:59.841
Casual racism is about negative prejudice
or racial stereotypes concerning race,

04:59.924 --> 05:02.385
and is most often
unintentionally offensive.

05:03.428 --> 05:04.804
They both have negative impact,

05:05.305 --> 05:08.558
but casual racism makes me laugh,
so I indulge.

05:29.704 --> 05:30.913
Great class, Mr. Caputo.

05:30.997 --> 05:33.333
Great questions, Denise. Keep 'em coming.

05:36.377 --> 05:41.299
Things usually go more smoothly
when the dean isn't observing my class.

05:41.382 --> 05:44.344
-No pressure.
-I thought I was being subtle.

05:44.427 --> 05:47.305
And I-- I just wanted to see
what all the buzz was about.

05:47.388 --> 05:50.183
Ah. There's buzz?

05:50.641 --> 05:55.063
In fact, I was wondering if you'd like
to take on another class next semester.

05:56.731 --> 05:58.149
-That'd be great.

05:58.232 --> 06:01.611
Excuse me

06:01.944 --> 06:03.321
Guilty as charged.

06:03.905 --> 06:04.989
You've been served.

06:06.908 --> 06:07.867
I'm sorry. What is this?

06:08.159 --> 06:09.452
It's a restraining order.

06:13.748 --> 06:14.749
For what?

06:18.961 --> 06:20.129
This is nuts.

06:22.590 --> 06:27.220
See, there was this woman
who I fired back in my old job

06:28.388 --> 06:32.141
who now, years later, is accusing me of...

06:33.059 --> 06:35.144
of some things I did not do.

06:35.228 --> 06:38.356
So, I went to her house to talk to her.

06:38.898 --> 06:42.110
But, um, I recently...

06:42.777 --> 06:46.239
I had a surgery on a very sensitive area,

06:46.614 --> 06:52.245
which she mistook for me
touching my you-know-what, and, um...

06:52.829 --> 06:55.706
This is sounding much worse than it is.

06:55.790 --> 06:57.750
Why don't we go down to HR,

06:57.834 --> 07:00.128
and you can fill them in
on all the details?

07:02.922 --> 07:05.466
-I feel like my neck grew two inches.

07:05.550 --> 07:07.760
I told you that class was great.

07:09.971 --> 07:11.514
Except for Madonna Arms

07:11.597 --> 07:14.517
rubbing her one-armed handstands
in everyone's face.

07:17.186 --> 07:20.231
My prison yoga teacher always used to say,

07:20.314 --> 07:25.736
"The surest way to lose balance
is by comparing yourself to other people."

07:25.820 --> 07:28.573
Your prison yoga teacher?

07:30.575 --> 07:31.701
-Thanks.
-Oh.

07:33.369 --> 07:35.997
Like I wasn't getting enough shade
for my pilled leggings.

07:36.080 --> 07:39.208
Don't call them "pilled." Say "textured."

07:39.292 --> 07:43.004
What happened to your promise
to own all of the parts of yourself?

07:43.504 --> 07:45.256
I am owning all of the parts.

07:47.175 --> 07:51.053
Matter of fact,
I'm coming clean to my coworkers today.

07:51.137 --> 07:52.138
Oh.

07:53.639 --> 07:55.057
Or maybe next week.

07:55.141 --> 07:57.477
Things get very crazy
at the end of the quarter.

07:57.560 --> 07:59.270
You need to stop making excuses,

07:59.353 --> 08:02.315
and just rip that Band-Aid
right off already.

08:02.398 --> 08:03.691
Meh.

08:04.066 --> 08:07.361
I'm more of a slow-peel kind of gal.

08:07.778 --> 08:10.907
You want that shame-scab to heal,
you gotta give it some air.

08:10.990 --> 08:12.241
If you enjoyed your free trial,

08:12.325 --> 08:14.410
we do have a new student special
going on right now.

08:14.494 --> 08:16.370
It's ten classes for 200 bucks.

08:16.454 --> 08:17.955
Not today. Thank you.

08:19.624 --> 08:21.751
Because I recently got out of prison,

08:21.834 --> 08:25.630
and between my low-paying job
and monthly probation fees,

08:25.713 --> 08:28.549
I can barely afford my rent.
But thank you.

08:35.014 --> 08:35.848
Hey.

08:37.391 --> 08:39.977
-I thought you were gonna go talk to Red.
-Yeah.

08:40.061 --> 08:44.190
Red has made it abundantly clear
that she does not want me in her business,

08:44.273 --> 08:47.735
which is fine
because I have my own shit to deal with.

08:47.818 --> 08:49.278
You see, I have the urgent task

08:49.362 --> 08:52.949
of tracking down a picture
of Shani's ex on Facebook.

08:53.658 --> 08:55.034
All right, so check it out.

08:55.785 --> 08:58.788
Now, you see, my money's on the one
with this nose ring,

08:58.871 --> 09:02.291
but I'm secretly hoping
it's the one with the thick calves.

09:02.625 --> 09:05.378
Something's wrong
with Sterling's Instagram account.

09:05.461 --> 09:07.713
Fuck. Oh, man.

09:07.797 --> 09:09.966
I really hope it's not the one
in "The Future Is Female" T-shirt, although I'm all for a future
if it looks like that.

09:12.301 --> 09:16.847
It says the account has been disabled
because of inappropriate content.

09:16.931 --> 09:19.809
Maybe it was all those naked pictures
you posted of him in the bath.

09:19.892 --> 09:22.562
No, his little Shrinky Dink's so small
you can barely see it.

09:22.645 --> 09:25.064
I'm sure whatever
anti-penis algorithm they're using

09:25.147 --> 09:27.024
doesn't discriminate by size.

09:27.108 --> 09:30.528
That doesn't make sense.
These photos were up for weeks.

09:30.611 --> 09:32.154
Why aren't you listening to me?

09:32.238 --> 09:33.864
Whoa, okay?

09:33.948 --> 09:39.203
We're two friends spending parallel
quality time together, all right?

09:39.287 --> 09:41.872
Your face is in your phone,
my face is in my phone,

09:41.956 --> 09:43.165
just like nature intended.

09:43.249 --> 09:45.334
No, I don't think
you're taking this seriously.

09:45.418 --> 09:47.920
All of Sterling's pictures are gone.

09:48.004 --> 09:50.965
I don't understand.
Who would do that to a baby?

09:51.048 --> 09:55.720
You still have pictures of the kid, right?
Why don't you just look at those?

09:58.306 --> 09:59.599
You're right.

10:01.017 --> 10:03.019
I have those pictures saved.

10:04.020 --> 10:05.980
I can start a new account.

10:06.314 --> 10:08.524
And I will wrestle with the fact
that Shani's last post

10:08.608 --> 10:13.279
was a Facebook video of her singing
"Don't Speak" at a karaoke bar.

10:14.238 --> 10:16.032
She's really lost some points here.

10:22.830 --> 10:25.916
-Fuck me sideways!
-Tough break, Fran.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.128
Let me show you how the masters do it.

10:29.211 --> 10:31.547
The only thing
you are the master of is BS.

10:31.631 --> 10:35.009
Oh, I think you mean BJs.

10:35.092 --> 10:36.135
Guess I picked the wrong sister.

10:36.218 --> 10:38.095
-Hey!
I was kidding.

10:38.179 --> 10:39.472
All right, you got this, Lorna.

10:39.555 --> 10:41.265
All right, all right. Here we go.

10:44.310 --> 10:46.979
Oh, my goodness! Oh, God.

10:47.063 --> 10:48.981
No worries. Barely spilled a drop.

10:49.065 --> 10:52.943
Oh. Well, you're brave,
drinking champagne in a dive like this.

10:53.027 --> 10:55.780
It's a special occasion!

10:56.364 --> 10:58.783
Oh, my God! It's so beautiful.

10:58.866 --> 11:01.702
They say three months' salary,
but I went four.

11:01.786 --> 11:05.665
Franny, come take your shot
before these two give you any ideas.

11:05.748 --> 11:07.583
Congratulations.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.877
You didn't ask her here, did you?

11:09.960 --> 11:12.838
-Please, I got this one trained.

11:12.922 --> 11:17.843
But this is where we first hooked up.
Three years ago to the day.

11:17.927 --> 11:20.012
That is so romantic.

11:20.096 --> 11:22.473
Tone, Tone, are you getting this?
This is so romantic.

11:22.556 --> 11:25.226
It's-- It's wonderful.
But we're in the middle of a game.

11:25.309 --> 11:28.104
It can wait. I want to hear,
like, how it happened.

11:28.688 --> 11:31.524
Have you ever been to the Pelican Hotel,
up on Sands Point?

11:31.607 --> 11:32.566
No.

11:32.650 --> 11:36.153
Well, they got this roof deck
overlookin' the ocean.

11:36.237 --> 11:39.073
And we'd just taken a long walk
down the beach--

11:39.156 --> 11:40.241
I was gonna ask her on the beach,

11:40.324 --> 11:43.327
but then all this seaweed washed up
and it reeked like rotten eggs.

11:43.411 --> 11:46.455
But I am so glad he waited,

11:46.539 --> 11:48.666
because by the time
he popped the question,

11:48.749 --> 11:53.879
the sun was setting at the exact moment.
It was so beautiful.

11:53.963 --> 11:55.464
I didn't even plan it that way.

11:55.548 --> 11:59.135
And we decided we're gettin' married
next June right on that same rooftop.

11:59.218 --> 12:01.220
Or the following June,
depending on availability.

12:01.303 --> 12:03.431
Lorna, you're up. We're waiting.

12:03.514 --> 12:06.934
I am so, so happy for the both of you.

12:07.017 --> 12:09.937
And I only hope that one day,

12:10.020 --> 12:13.774
I can find the kind of love
that you two share together.

12:18.904 --> 12:20.865
-Okay, all right.
-Okay, okay.

12:20.948 --> 12:23.868
-You go first. I'll bring you over here.
-Thank you. Yes, I got it.

12:23.951 --> 12:25.035
No, I got you. I got you.

12:25.119 --> 12:27.830
Come on, Lorna,
your sister and Jack took off.

12:27.913 --> 12:29.373
-Let me give you a ride home.
-No, no.

12:29.457 --> 12:31.208
-It's a nice night. I'm gonna walk.
-Come on. Hey.

12:31.292 --> 12:33.127
What's the matter

12:33.210 --> 12:35.296
Why you givin' me the cold shoulder
all of a sudden?

12:35.379 --> 12:37.173
-Okay, all right. Stop.
-Come here. Come here.

12:37.256 --> 12:39.341
-Let me--
-Stop! It's not gonna work!

12:39.425 --> 12:41.635
I deserve to be with somebody
who loves love.

12:43.512 --> 12:45.681
You are such a goddamn tease,

12:46.432 --> 12:49.977
talking about giving BJs all night. Huh?

12:50.060 --> 12:51.187
You think you're so hot?

12:53.731 --> 12:55.065
Unbelievable.

12:58.152 --> 13:00.154
And you're a shitty pool player!

13:12.625 --> 13:15.294
Yes! This is amazing!

13:15.795 --> 13:18.547
Hey,
according to <i>Padilla v. Kentucky,</i>

13:18.631 --> 13:20.466
if they fucked up my criminal case,

13:20.549 --> 13:22.718
my immigration case is void.

13:22.802 --> 13:25.554
That's called precedent, Matlock.

13:26.055 --> 13:27.264
Nice work.

13:27.348 --> 13:28.933
Matlock? Mmm-mmm.

13:29.016 --> 13:31.685
I prefer to think of myself
as Latina Ally McBeal.

13:33.479 --> 13:34.814
Detainees!

13:36.857 --> 13:38.234
Mail call!

13:39.109 --> 13:40.236
213.

13:43.280 --> 13:45.241
-968.
That's me. I'm here.

13:45.324 --> 13:46.534
Maybe there's something
from Diablo.

13:46.617 --> 13:48.077
Relax, lover girl.

13:48.160 --> 13:50.037
I doubt
he even got your letter yet.

13:50.120 --> 13:51.247
You don't know that.

13:51.956 --> 13:54.083
Uh, 519.

13:54.166 --> 13:56.085
It must be something about my case.

14:04.468 --> 14:07.054
You need to wait
till your A-number's called.

14:07.137 --> 14:08.681
I'm 519.

14:13.602 --> 14:14.895
643.

14:16.939 --> 14:19.859
And last but not least, lucky 439.

14:34.206 --> 14:37.418
Touch me again
and you're going in the box. And you need to speak English or Spanish.

14:41.088 --> 14:42.131
<i>Comprende?</i>

14:47.428 --> 14:48.721
What's wrong?

14:50.389 --> 14:52.933
It says I need
to appear in court on Monday

14:53.017 --> 14:55.269
or I could lose custody of my kids.

14:55.728 --> 14:56.729
What?

14:57.062 --> 14:58.314
That can't be right.

14:58.397 --> 15:00.107
Don't they have to give you
the opportunity to be there?

15:00.441 --> 15:04.361
Legally, yes. But nobody cares.

15:04.945 --> 15:07.865
Maybe someone else can go instead.
Like their dad, or an aunt or uncle?

15:07.948 --> 15:11.827
No. My husband died a year ago.

15:12.661 --> 15:19.460
Everyone else I know is undocumented
or in El Salvador.

15:22.087 --> 15:25.049
It's my kids, Blanca.
What am I going to do?

15:35.643 --> 15:38.812
Rabbi Tatelbaum did write you
a glowing recommendation,

15:38.896 --> 15:41.106
but four years in federal prison--

15:41.190 --> 15:43.067
Ms. Wernick, okay, let me stop you.

15:43.150 --> 15:45.527
I know I'm not the ideal candidate,

15:46.904 --> 15:48.364
but if you give me a chance,

15:48.447 --> 15:50.574
I promise I will take really good care
of these people.

15:51.784 --> 15:54.536
Am I allowed to ask?

15:54.620 --> 15:56.664
I mean, I, I don't know
if I'm allowed to ask.

15:56.747 --> 15:57.831
If you don't want to say--

15:57.915 --> 16:03.420
No. It's all right.
It's all right. I... I did it.

16:04.380 --> 16:06.465
I shouldn't have done it, but I did it.

16:08.425 --> 16:09.551
Um...

16:10.469 --> 16:14.640
Back at my last job,
when I worked for TSA,

16:14.723 --> 16:16.725
I took some things that I shouldn't have.

16:16.809 --> 16:18.769
But I'm not that same person now.

16:19.436 --> 16:24.108
I mean, I am accountable for my actions
in the past.

16:24.858 --> 16:27.987
But I don't want to be like that anymore
because it ends up hurting people.

16:28.070 --> 16:28.904
Not physically, though.

16:29.822 --> 16:31.407
If I can be honest, Cindy,

16:31.490 --> 16:34.576
I'm not sure you're suited
for this line of work.

16:35.160 --> 16:39.623
Many of our residents are both physically
and cognitively impaired.

16:39.707 --> 16:43.293
There are diapers to change
and, uh, spills to clean.

16:43.377 --> 16:46.130
Some scream and use abusive language.

16:46.213 --> 16:48.590
Sounds like my old cell block.

16:48.674 --> 16:50.300
-But I'm being serious.

16:50.968 --> 16:54.972
Look, prison is perfect training
for a place like this.

16:55.055 --> 16:57.474
All right, look.
You got the same mushy food,

16:58.225 --> 17:01.937
people living close to each other,
all up in each other's business.

17:02.479 --> 17:04.398
And here's what I learned.

17:05.441 --> 17:07.276
You can't change people.

17:10.446 --> 17:12.573
Especially the old ones.

17:14.074 --> 17:17.244
But what you can change
is your attitude to 'em.

17:18.287 --> 17:20.873
And more importantly,
you gotta have a sense of humor.

17:20.956 --> 17:24.543
You know, funny is like duct tape.
It fixes everything.

17:27.588 --> 17:29.339
-I suppose we could give it a shot.
-Yes!

17:29.423 --> 17:30.799
But you should know,

17:31.508 --> 17:32.426
half these <i>alter kockers</i>

17:32.509 --> 17:34.094
will think
you're stealing from them anyway.

17:34.178 --> 17:37.097
Oh, please. See, I been black
my whole life, so I get it.

17:41.101 --> 17:41.977
Do I got a job?

17:43.645 --> 17:47.566
Yes! I got the job!
Thank you so much, boss lady!

17:47.649 --> 17:49.693
Seven out of ten. Sweet!

17:49.777 --> 17:51.070
That's still a C-minus.

17:51.153 --> 17:54.615
Well, it's six points higher
than the last time. Wait.

17:57.034 --> 17:59.453
Congratulations, Ms. Doggett.
Looks like the tutoring's working out.

17:59.536 --> 18:03.082
Oh, yeah. No, Taystee's actually
really been helping me.

18:03.165 --> 18:07.669
And she ain't so mopey anymore.
It's kinda like a who-saved-who situation.

18:07.753 --> 18:09.630
Who saved whom.

18:09.713 --> 18:12.549
That's what I'm saying.
It's, like, impossible to tell.

18:15.052 --> 18:16.428
You got room for three more?

18:17.012 --> 18:19.431
Uh, we're already
halfway through the semester,

18:19.515 --> 18:22.017
but I never discourage
the desire to learn.

18:22.101 --> 18:26.021
Hmm. And we love learning. Don't we?

18:26.105 --> 18:27.689
The world is our classroom.

18:27.773 --> 18:31.110
Okay, let's have a look at this passage
on the American Civil War.

18:31.193 --> 18:33.695
Maybe we should sell
those performance-enhancing pills

18:33.779 --> 18:35.364
that college kids take?

18:35.447 --> 18:37.950
Who the fuck does drugs
to do more homework, stupid?

18:38.033 --> 18:41.537
Can you guys shut up?
I'm trying to listen.

18:42.746 --> 18:46.208
Looks like somebody wants
to suck on that Filipino egg roll, huh?

18:46.291 --> 18:47.793
They're called lumpia.

18:47.876 --> 18:49.962
The egg roll or the dick?

18:50.045 --> 18:52.381
The egg roll,
which, by the way, is fucking delicious.

18:52.464 --> 18:54.758
Mmm. I bet that dick is, too.

19:09.565 --> 19:11.900
Hey, Lorna,
uh, can you empty out these taters?

19:11.984 --> 19:13.527
I could really use the extra box.

19:13.610 --> 19:15.696
That's funny. When I needed help from you,

19:15.779 --> 19:18.991
you were too busy creeping on
Queen Nefertitty's Facebook page,

19:19.074 --> 19:20.701
but now you need help from me.

19:20.784 --> 19:23.120
Uh, Red,
do you mind if I use this?

19:24.913 --> 19:25.998
Did you hear something?

19:27.499 --> 19:29.668
No, I didn't. Did you?

19:29.751 --> 19:30.961
Well, it's difficult to say.

19:31.044 --> 19:35.883
You know, I'm getting so old and decrepit.
I think I might be losing my hearing.

19:35.966 --> 19:40.262
Really
You're fucking children.

19:48.729 --> 19:52.608
-It's called Operation Splatter Pants.

19:52.691 --> 19:55.068
I'm gonna put this
across Litvack's toilet seat.

19:55.152 --> 19:58.447
<i>Ay, nena,</i> please. Stop wasting your time
with practical jokes.

19:58.530 --> 20:00.199
You're never gonna
get in his bathroom anyway.

20:01.074 --> 20:05.329
Could you be a little bit more supportive?
I'm pranking on behalf of our people.

20:05.412 --> 20:07.706
And I'm actually doing something
to help them.

20:07.789 --> 20:10.167
But I guess you were only a Jedi
for Maritza.

20:10.250 --> 20:12.169
Dropping off your migrant laborers.

20:12.753 --> 20:13.921
Thank you...

20:15.130 --> 20:17.758
Mr. C. Litvack.

20:21.178 --> 20:22.471
C. Litvack.

20:24.389 --> 20:27.392
C. Litvack. Oh, my God.
It can't be so easy.

20:27.476 --> 20:30.604
-I heard the "C" stands for "Carlos."
-Or "Cocksucker."

20:31.772 --> 20:33.023
You guys don't you get it?

20:33.106 --> 20:36.443
"C" plus "Litvack" equals "Clitvack."

20:36.526 --> 20:38.904
It's, like, somebody vacuuming your clit.

20:39.238 --> 20:40.572
Mmm, that sounds painful.

20:40.656 --> 20:42.866
Or fantastic,
depending on the suction level.

20:43.575 --> 20:45.577
It's gonna be like this one time
in high school

20:45.661 --> 20:49.373
when I got everyone to call
this one skank, Janice, "chicken nugget,"

20:49.456 --> 20:51.667
'cause she smelled like honey mustard
and stole my boyfriend.

20:53.043 --> 20:55.837
Mean nicknames
are like the herpes of bullying.

20:55.921 --> 20:58.674
Once you got one, it never goes away.

20:59.758 --> 21:00.676
What's all this?

21:01.051 --> 21:05.138
You know, I figured we could use
a little bit of insulation while we work.

21:05.222 --> 21:06.932
You know, to keep out the chill.

21:12.562 --> 21:15.107
Welcome to my hidey hole.

21:24.032 --> 21:28.328
Now, in an ideal world, we'd have
some sexy lighting and mood music.

21:28.912 --> 21:33.000
I wish I had a blackberry scone for you,
but they're thin on the ground.

21:34.001 --> 21:36.795
At least we have a quiet place

21:36.878 --> 21:41.091
to tenderize the meat, so to speak.

21:44.553 --> 21:46.596
How did you know I like blackberry scones?

21:46.680 --> 21:48.974
Because you're a human who breathes air.

21:49.057 --> 21:52.561
And, uh, pretty sure
you mentioned it last week.

21:54.354 --> 21:56.023
And I took a deep dive

21:56.106 --> 21:58.108
-into your Facebook, so...
-Hmm.

21:58.191 --> 22:00.694
I'm flattered.
-Ah!

22:00.777 --> 22:02.738
I've never had a stalker before.

22:06.825 --> 22:07.701
Mmm-mmm.

22:07.784 --> 22:11.705
Hey. Hey. I mean,
I'm pretty sure it's your turn.

22:12.497 --> 22:13.874
Not... Not right now.

22:14.875 --> 22:15.959
Let me touch you.

22:16.043 --> 22:17.169
Oh.

22:18.003 --> 22:21.048
Believe me, I'm a big, big fan
of all that you do,

22:21.131 --> 22:23.884
but I'd really like to return the favor
every now and then.

22:24.593 --> 22:26.345
I don't know why
this isn't enough for you.

22:26.428 --> 22:29.973
Whoa. Whoa. Did I do something wrong?

22:31.516 --> 22:34.895
What? If you're afraid
you're gonna make too much noise, right,

22:34.978 --> 22:40.525
we could just turn on the oven fan
or the blender, if you're a screamer.

22:45.697 --> 22:48.617
Okay.
-We have too much work to do.

22:48.700 --> 22:49.951
Yeah, yeah.

22:54.664 --> 22:55.707
Try it now.

22:59.419 --> 23:01.922
-That flicker was giving me epilepsy.

23:02.005 --> 23:05.092
I was right about the socket.
It wasn't hitting its contact point.

23:05.175 --> 23:07.260
Where on earth did you learn to do that?

23:07.344 --> 23:08.512
Certainly not from her father.

23:08.595 --> 23:09.846
Actually...

23:12.015 --> 23:16.770
Actually, I was forced to take
an electrical skills class

23:16.853 --> 23:17.979
while I was in...

23:18.063 --> 23:22.317
Beverly, can you find me the file
on the '08 Robinson return, please?

23:23.568 --> 23:25.529
-...in the Peace Corps.
Huh.

23:26.196 --> 23:28.865
I didn't think
those African villages had electricity.

23:30.117 --> 23:33.537
Solar panels. We installed solar panels.

23:33.620 --> 23:34.996
Isn't that something?

23:35.497 --> 23:39.584
Taking time to help the less fortunate.
And so eco-friendly.

23:40.127 --> 23:41.545
It was nothing, really.

23:41.628 --> 23:45.715
I'm surprised you work here,
with your expertise in clean energy.

23:45.799 --> 23:47.843
Yeah, well...

23:47.926 --> 23:49.845
-Here it is.
-Thank you.

23:50.470 --> 23:52.264
I was in prison.

23:54.307 --> 23:55.475
I wasn't in the Peace Corps,

23:55.559 --> 24:00.397
and I wasn't in that dude ranch
rehab place in Arizona.

24:01.606 --> 24:05.193
I trafficked drug money after college,

24:05.777 --> 24:08.405
and I went to prison for it.

24:11.366 --> 24:13.201
We all make mistakes, honey.

24:13.285 --> 24:16.788
No, seriously.
You should see my first husband.

24:17.956 --> 24:19.875
And, Heather,
I ate your welcome-back cookie cake,

24:19.958 --> 24:21.418
and, Joanne, I drank your tequila.

24:21.501 --> 24:23.003
What tequila?

24:23.086 --> 24:28.300
You got me a cookie cake?
Guys, that's so sweet.

24:32.304 --> 24:36.558
You know, we could probably fit,
like, two more if we positioned them,

24:37.601 --> 24:41.438
you know, like this,
in the under-boob area.

24:42.814 --> 24:46.026
Is this what they mean
by "vertical integration"?

24:46.109 --> 24:49.112
Yes. Yes, I believe so.

24:49.779 --> 24:51.239
You're good at this.

24:51.323 --> 24:53.700
I have a gift for spatial relationships.

24:53.783 --> 24:56.161
You should see me put leftovers
into Tupperware.

24:57.829 --> 24:59.623
I meant dealing.

25:00.207 --> 25:02.375
I'd still be trying
to sell my mom's fish oil supplements

25:02.459 --> 25:03.585
if it weren't for you.

25:03.668 --> 25:06.588
And I'm not just saying that
to make you keep doing it.

25:06.671 --> 25:08.215
No, it's fine. I mean, we can...

25:10.467 --> 25:13.345
We can keep doing it. I mean,
at least until you're back on your feet.

25:13.678 --> 25:16.473
You sure? 'Cause we can stop
any time you want.

25:16.556 --> 25:17.974
No, I don't want to stop.

25:19.392 --> 25:21.228
-Selling chargers.

25:22.354 --> 25:23.355
Good.

25:51.466 --> 25:54.135
-Easy, easy. Jesus, slow down.

25:54.219 --> 25:56.680
I am trying to firm up this soft serve.

25:56.763 --> 25:59.015
It's this place.
It's so goddamn depressing.

25:59.099 --> 26:00.433
I am a busy woman,

26:00.517 --> 26:02.227
and besides,
it didn't seem to bother you last time

26:02.310 --> 26:03.562
when you bent me over the desk.

26:03.937 --> 26:05.438
Come on, come on...  Come on, come on.

26:07.107 --> 26:08.984
-Damn it. Please, let me...
-Okay.

26:09.067 --> 26:11.069
-Please, let me just give it a try.
-Okay, okay.

26:12.862 --> 26:14.573
Uh-huh. Mmm.

26:16.741 --> 26:20.036
I'd offer to stick a finger up your ass,
but I just got my tips done.

26:22.205 --> 26:23.498
You know what this is?

26:24.332 --> 26:27.544
It's the fucking restraining order.
I can't get it out of my mind.

26:27.627 --> 26:30.505
Why are you letting that woman get to you?

26:30.589 --> 26:32.048
I lost my job over her.

26:32.132 --> 26:35.594
Job? You taught one class
at community college.

26:37.012 --> 26:39.598
-I gotta tell Tamika.
-Absolutely not.

26:39.681 --> 26:44.644
I got to explain to her what happened,
and tell her about the restraining order.

26:44.728 --> 26:46.813
If this gets out before I get ahead of it,

26:46.896 --> 26:49.357
it'll blow up
the whole restorative justice program.

26:49.441 --> 26:51.943
You tell Tamika,
she will have no choice but to fire you,

26:52.027 --> 26:54.571
which is exactly what
this Fischer woman wants.

26:54.654 --> 26:57.616
Joseph, you are one of the good ones.

26:57.699 --> 27:00.660
You had a creepy little crush
on an ex-employee,

27:00.744 --> 27:01.995
big fucking whoop.

27:02.746 --> 27:06.750
Don't let some PG-13 non-event
that happened

27:06.833 --> 27:09.669
at a whole different time,
in a whole different place,

27:09.753 --> 27:14.591
take away from the good you are doing now.

27:19.929 --> 27:21.056
You think I'm doing good?

27:22.307 --> 27:24.809
You'll never hear me
say this again, but yes,

27:24.893 --> 27:28.063
you are making a difference
in these women's lives.

27:31.232 --> 27:33.568
Now nut up and make me some baby batter.

27:34.986 --> 27:38.948
<i>It's like a dinosaur. A big dinosaur cock.</i>

27:39.032 --> 27:42.661
<i>You're gonna stretch out</i>
<i>my tiny pussy with that. </i>

27:43.244 --> 27:44.746
<i>Stretch out my tiny pussy.</i>

27:48.208 --> 27:51.961
I got news! And a pie!

27:52.837 --> 27:55.131
No, you lied to me!
I had no choice!

27:55.215 --> 27:57.175
Bullshit!
I knew something wasn't right.

27:57.258 --> 27:58.968
The way you look at me,
the way you treat me,

27:59.052 --> 28:01.805
the way you yell at me all the time
and all your stupid rules.

28:01.888 --> 28:03.014
-I fucking hate you!
-Wait--

28:03.098 --> 28:03.973
Whoa!

28:04.057 --> 28:07.268
Monica! I don't care what she did.
You don't talk to Mom like that.

28:07.352 --> 28:09.646
That's a good one.

28:09.729 --> 28:11.189
'Cause this letter
says something different.

28:11.272 --> 28:13.817
What do you mean

28:13.900 --> 28:16.820
What's the matter, prison girl?
Can't you read?

28:17.904 --> 28:20.281
One of your prison friends.

28:21.282 --> 28:22.784
They told her everything.

28:23.493 --> 28:25.078
So you gonna admit it?

28:25.161 --> 28:28.123
Or are you gonna just keep lying to me,
like you have my entire life?

28:29.916 --> 28:30.750
Uh...

28:31.334 --> 28:32.460
Fuck all y'all.

28:33.294 --> 28:35.505
You're a lyin' bitch,
and you're a waste of fuckin' space.

28:35.588 --> 28:38.883
Far as I'm concerned,
I don't got a mother.

28:38.967 --> 28:40.552
-Monica.
Wait.

28:40.635 --> 28:43.179
-Monica. Monica!
-Don't go. Don't...

28:43.263 --> 28:44.806
Mom...

28:44.889 --> 28:48.476
Ma, I swear on the Bible,
I had nothing to do with this.

28:48.560 --> 28:50.395
No, Mom, please, you gotta believe it.

28:50.478 --> 28:53.440
The last thing I want in this world
is to bring you trouble.

28:53.523 --> 28:56.943
It's never your fault, is it, Cindy?

28:58.194 --> 29:02.532
But somehow, every time you show up,

29:02.615 --> 29:05.994
there's a whole new mess I got to clean.

29:06.953 --> 29:07.996
Ma...

29:13.460 --> 29:15.837
Slaves were used for manual labor
by the Confederacy,

29:15.920 --> 29:17.172
but there was
a tremendous amount of debate

29:17.255 --> 29:19.674
about whether or not to arm black slaves.

29:19.758 --> 29:23.303
Now, just as a reminder, someone tell me,
the period after the war ended,

29:23.386 --> 29:25.889
when the South reintegrated
with the North, was called...

29:25.972 --> 29:27.557
LeBron James.

29:29.934 --> 29:31.478
What is Reconstruction?

29:31.561 --> 29:33.229
I hope everyone heard Ms. Doggett's answer

29:33.313 --> 29:35.982
'cause we're gonna be
discussing it tomorrow. Class dismissed.

29:43.573 --> 29:46.951
What the fuck?
You're gonna kick 'em out, right?

29:47.035 --> 29:48.077
I'll talk to 'em about it.

29:48.161 --> 29:50.163
Well, at least give 'em detention.

29:50.246 --> 29:52.040
Kind of redundant, don't you think?

29:52.123 --> 29:57.962
They're laughing and they're whispering.
It's really, uh, it's agitating my brain.

29:58.046 --> 29:59.464
Like, I don't even know,

29:59.547 --> 30:02.425
is the Confederate flag
the good or the bad one?

30:02.509 --> 30:04.177
Bad. It is definitely bad.

30:04.552 --> 30:09.474
But think of this as practice
for overcoming distractions on the test.

30:09.557 --> 30:11.017
-Okay.
-You're doing great, Ms. Doggett,

30:11.100 --> 30:13.603
and if you can stay focused,
you're gonna pass with flying colors.

30:13.686 --> 30:15.897
Hmm.

30:15.980 --> 30:17.774
-Yes, I will.
-Yeah.

30:19.484 --> 30:20.819
Try-hard.

30:20.902 --> 30:23.071
Mr. Elmer, your class was lit.

30:23.154 --> 30:25.615
Thank you. Maybe you can enjoy it
a bit more quietly next time.

30:25.698 --> 30:28.493
Oh. We apologize for our enthusiasm.

30:28.576 --> 30:30.662
-We are big Civil War buffs.
-Mmm-hmm.

30:31.037 --> 30:32.121
Can't wait to see who wins.

30:33.039 --> 30:33.915
You do know that--

30:33.998 --> 30:37.085
Eh. No spoilers.

30:37.168 --> 30:39.671
Smart guy like you must read
all the dead white guy books.

30:39.754 --> 30:42.090
The brain's a muscle.
Reading keeps it exercised.

30:42.173 --> 30:43.800
You know what? I have this friend,

30:43.883 --> 30:46.469
and she keeps on talking
about this book that she's reading.

30:46.553 --> 30:48.513
So, maybe I could give you her number,

30:48.596 --> 30:50.306
and you can borrow it
and bring it in here for us.

30:50.390 --> 30:52.475
Actually, I can't bring
outside materials to inmates.

30:52.559 --> 30:54.185
We had a whole
four-hour training session on it.

30:54.269 --> 30:58.273
I'll give you a four-hour training session
in the art of tantric sex.

30:58.356 --> 31:01.192
Okay, please stop.
I need you all to leave right now.

31:01.276 --> 31:03.403
And we need you to do as we ask.

31:03.695 --> 31:04.612
Yeah.

31:06.281 --> 31:07.699
So, here's my friend's number.

31:10.910 --> 31:12.078
-Yeah.

31:12.996 --> 31:15.081
She'll be happy to bring the book to you.

31:15.498 --> 31:18.209
Maybe at the Little League in Flatbush?

31:19.419 --> 31:23.172
You know,
where you coach your kid's T

31:25.216 --> 31:26.676
Don't lose it.

31:28.845 --> 31:30.889
Fucking little cunt boxes, come on.

31:34.559 --> 31:35.476
Want a hand?

31:37.937 --> 31:40.064
Well, obviously more than you do.

31:49.073 --> 31:51.492
A few days before I turned 12,

31:53.077 --> 31:56.456
my mother said we were going to a party.

31:58.958 --> 32:03.880
But then when we got there,
I didn't recognize any of the other girls.

32:05.590 --> 32:09.052
Then I heard screams coming from upstairs.

32:09.636 --> 32:11.804
Would you mind
moving this along a little bit?

32:11.888 --> 32:13.056
Vinnie's coming to see me.

32:13.139 --> 32:14.682
Give us a minute.

32:19.395 --> 32:20.605
Yeah?

32:22.023 --> 32:25.485
The woman, she cuts me with a razor blade.

32:27.862 --> 32:31.783
It felt like hot steel
shooting through my veins.

32:34.035 --> 32:35.244
Then the blood.

32:36.704 --> 32:38.206
There was so much blood.

32:40.917 --> 32:45.171
I kept screaming, "Why"

32:46.631 --> 32:51.344
She said I should be grateful
to be rid of this bug.

32:52.261 --> 32:54.013
Do you mean, like, your...

33:01.437 --> 33:03.940
How could your mother
let them do this to you?

33:04.440 --> 33:05.650
Because she's the same.

33:06.526 --> 33:08.361
It's part of our culture.

33:08.903 --> 33:11.239
I didn't know I was different
until I came here

33:12.615 --> 33:14.784
and I heard the words.

33:15.702 --> 33:18.121
"Female genital mutilation."

33:19.372 --> 33:23.584
Shani, I am so, so sorry.

33:23.668 --> 33:25.378
What is the holdup out here?

33:25.461 --> 33:27.422
I'm kind of in the middle of something.

33:27.505 --> 33:30.174
Okay. Well, Vinnie's gonna be mad
if I'm late.

33:30.258 --> 33:34.262
He is a single father
with responsibilities. Let's go!

33:34.345 --> 33:36.139
All right.

33:37.223 --> 33:38.433
I'm sorry about that.

33:39.308 --> 33:41.019
No, Nicky, I'm sorry.

33:42.478 --> 33:43.563
I want to be with you.

33:45.398 --> 33:46.941
Believe me, I do.

33:49.068 --> 33:50.361
But I can't.

33:51.487 --> 33:54.866
At least, not in that way.

33:57.285 --> 33:58.536
Come here.

34:02.623 --> 34:04.083
...and by that time,

34:04.167 --> 34:08.713
all I could pick was
TheRealSterling_Pooper,

34:08.796 --> 34:11.632
-and then they shut that one down, too.
-Jesus, Lorna, enough!

34:13.885 --> 34:14.969
It was me.

34:16.304 --> 34:19.265
I'm the one who reported your accounts.

34:22.018 --> 34:24.020
Why would you do something like that?

34:24.979 --> 34:27.231
You know how hard this is for me, right?

34:27.315 --> 34:29.192
Being in here, not able to hold my baby...

34:29.275 --> 34:30.985
Those pictures, they're all I have.

34:31.069 --> 34:32.028
That's not Sterling.

34:35.031 --> 34:37.825
I don't know where you're getting
those photos, but it's not him.

34:38.993 --> 34:41.537
-That's someone else's baby.

34:42.413 --> 34:43.873
Could you please stop saying that?

34:45.166 --> 34:47.418
Your baby is dead, Lorna.

34:48.961 --> 34:51.589
Our baby, he died of pneumonia.

34:54.383 --> 34:58.554
If you can't accept that,
then maybe you should get some help.

34:58.638 --> 34:59.931
You need help!

35:00.014 --> 35:01.099
Of course I do!

35:01.682 --> 35:03.392
I'm grieving for my son,

35:03.768 --> 35:06.521
which is hard enough
without you making it worse

35:06.604 --> 35:08.523
by pretending he's still alive.

35:12.693 --> 35:14.695
Could you please lower your voice

35:19.742 --> 35:21.786
I miss him so much.

35:25.748 --> 35:27.416
I think about him every day.

35:28.334 --> 35:33.256
But I thought at least we could
help each other to get through this.

35:38.344 --> 35:41.097
You didn't leave the baby
with my sister Franny, did you?

35:41.180 --> 35:43.808
Because you know,
this one time, I saw her,

35:43.891 --> 35:46.477
she let my nephew teethe
on a packet of cigarettes.

35:46.561 --> 35:50.064
I mean, would you believe that?
It was probably more than one time.

35:54.068 --> 35:55.444
I'm sorry.

35:58.281 --> 36:00.116
But I can't do this anymore.

36:02.785 --> 36:04.328
I want to be with you,

36:05.955 --> 36:08.291
but if you can't live in reality...

36:14.589 --> 36:17.133
then maybe we should get a divorce.

36:22.013 --> 36:23.055
Lorna?

36:24.891 --> 36:26.392
Did you hear what I just said?

36:34.901 --> 36:35.902
Lorna.

36:55.296 --> 36:58.674
Excuse me, miss? We need to start
setting up for a private party.

37:00.760 --> 37:02.803
Uh-huh. Of course.

37:03.971 --> 37:04.805
Yes.

37:07.225 --> 37:08.392
Where am I?

37:09.268 --> 37:12.813
This is our rooftop lounge.
Are you a guest of the hotel?

37:14.315 --> 37:15.149
Yes.

37:17.443 --> 37:19.070
What room are you in?

37:20.196 --> 37:23.449
You know, I know I'm not sure because...

37:24.659 --> 37:26.202
I can't find my key.

37:29.205 --> 37:32.667
I'm sure our concierge
will be happy to assist you.

37:32.750 --> 37:34.293
-Yeah.

37:37.129 --> 37:38.965
Ma'am, are you okay?

37:39.674 --> 37:40.925
Need me to call someone?

37:45.054 --> 37:46.722
No. No, I'm fine.

37:48.849 --> 37:50.017
Where is the restroom?

37:52.144 --> 37:56.983
<i>♪ We'll walk along the sand in paradise ♪</i>

39:02.673 --> 39:04.425
Is now a good time?

39:05.551 --> 39:07.470
Interesting question, coming from you.

39:07.887 --> 39:08.888
Listen...

39:10.097 --> 39:10.973
Dad.

39:13.309 --> 39:15.102
I'm sorry if I embarrassed you in there.

39:15.186 --> 39:17.605
And I should have
talked to you beforehand.

39:17.938 --> 39:20.733
Piper, I don't understand.
Is it a millennial thing?

39:20.816 --> 39:23.944
This need to share everything
with the world?

39:24.528 --> 39:29.116
Do you know... how exhausting it is

39:29.200 --> 39:32.912
to walk around every day pretending
like a part of your life doesn't exist?

39:33.329 --> 39:37.416
No, I do not.
Because... I was never a criminal.

39:37.500 --> 39:39.210
But you did cheat on Mom.

39:44.173 --> 39:45.174
Mmm.

39:46.258 --> 39:47.843
I didn't realize you knew that. I'm so sorry. That wasn't fair.

39:53.015 --> 39:54.934
It wasn't fair to your mother, either.

39:56.227 --> 39:57.770
Or you or your brothers.

40:00.773 --> 40:03.150
But we got through it. After time.

40:04.735 --> 40:06.570
If you wanna fire me, I understand.

40:09.115 --> 40:11.492
I honestly don't know what to do with you.

40:12.785 --> 40:16.455
Dad, I get I'm not the person
that you want me to be.

40:18.541 --> 40:21.168
But isn't that the entire point of family?

40:22.294 --> 40:26.132
You get who you get and you love them
despite all the stuff that they do.

40:27.466 --> 40:28.467
Hmm.

40:30.428 --> 40:31.762
I suppose I...

40:32.805 --> 40:35.683
I really don't have the grounds
for firing you.

40:36.976 --> 40:38.018
You're doing a nice job.

40:38.102 --> 40:41.230
Oh, thank God. Oh.

40:41.313 --> 40:44.859
Because I really am
the world's shittiest waitress.

40:46.694 --> 40:48.737
But, I have to ask you,

40:49.864 --> 40:52.408
despite all of your
White Anglo-Saxon Protestant instincts

40:52.491 --> 40:56.203
to stifle and repress, to accept that...

40:59.206 --> 41:00.541
this is who I am.

41:02.209 --> 41:04.170
-The whole résumé.

41:04.253 --> 41:08.966
Drug mule, federal prison,
lesbian inmate wife, cookie cake thief.

41:09.049 --> 41:10.134
Whole thing.

41:10.718 --> 41:14.221
Okay.
Is this truth-telling limited to words,

41:14.972 --> 41:16.599
or can it include visuals?

41:18.309 --> 41:20.060
-Oh, no.
-Mmm-hmm.

41:20.144 --> 41:22.188
-Oh, no, no, no.
-Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

41:22.271 --> 41:25.566
-No.
-Wait until the girls get a load of this.

41:28.486 --> 41:30.321
What is wrong with me?

41:31.238 --> 41:32.698
Oh!

41:42.750 --> 41:43.834
Has he seen that yet?

41:43.918 --> 41:45.920
Dude's in beast mode.

41:46.003 --> 41:48.172
But at least he stopped playing
Alanis Morissette on repeat.

41:53.052 --> 41:54.595
And it's not coming off!

41:59.892 --> 42:00.893
Mr. Clit--

42:01.644 --> 42:02.728
Li-- Litvack.

42:03.479 --> 42:06.148
I'm sorry.
Detainee Córdova's here to see you.

42:13.906 --> 42:15.074
Wow.

42:15.157 --> 42:18.786
And I thought I had a lot of paperwork
when I worked at a law firm.

42:22.373 --> 42:25.084
-Yes.

42:25.167 --> 42:26.835
I mean, maybe.

42:28.420 --> 42:29.880
Do you have children, sir?

42:29.964 --> 42:32.591
I don't discuss my personal life
with detainees.

42:33.050 --> 42:36.428
And I'm very busy.
So either get out or get to the point. Yes, sir. I would like
to request transportation

42:39.974 --> 42:43.018
to attend my children's custody hearing
on Monday.

42:43.394 --> 42:44.895
Here. Fill this out.

42:46.230 --> 42:50.067
But these forms take weeks to process,

42:51.193 --> 42:52.820
and the hearing's two days away.

42:52.903 --> 42:56.448
Great, so the answer is no,
and it saves us both some paperwork.

42:57.074 --> 42:58.659
But I have a right to be there.

43:00.119 --> 43:03.330
And you have a legal obligation
to transport me.

43:06.625 --> 43:10.170
Clitvack! I love it.

43:11.755 --> 43:13.424
All right, <i>vámonos,</i> ladies.

43:13.507 --> 43:16.093
-No.

43:17.344 --> 43:21.265
But I have to be there in person
or I could lose custody of my kids.

43:21.348 --> 43:22.766
You should have thought about that

43:22.850 --> 43:24.977
before you came
into this country illegally.

43:40.743 --> 43:44.371
Jamilla's mother called.
She's spending the night there.

43:46.749 --> 43:49.251
Not that you seem too concerned.

44:01.764 --> 44:02.890
I'm sorry, Ma.

44:03.515 --> 44:05.893
Got a real funny way of showing it.

44:06.352 --> 44:07.978
The two of you are better off without me.

44:08.562 --> 44:13.734
She's gonna be back tomorrow.
We should both sit down and talk with her.

44:14.318 --> 44:16.654
I think it's best if I just go.

44:18.530 --> 44:19.740
Wait, Cindy!

44:20.574 --> 44:21.992
That's it, then?

44:22.076 --> 44:26.622
You drop a bomb in the middle of my house
and then run off?

44:27.456 --> 44:29.291
I thought you said you changed.

44:29.375 --> 44:31.460
I thought things would be different.

44:32.836 --> 44:37.341
That if I try hard enough,
maybe I could fix what I messed up.

44:38.634 --> 44:42.304
But it doesn't matter what I do,
or how bad I want to change.

44:42.388 --> 44:45.683
All I ever end up doing
is making things worse.

44:46.016 --> 44:49.978
Cindy, I want you to stay here
and talk to your daughter

44:50.062 --> 44:52.064
and try to make things right.

44:55.317 --> 44:56.860
Tell Monica I love her.

44:58.612 --> 44:59.738
Fine.

45:02.074 --> 45:04.952
Do not come back here again.

45:17.172 --> 45:18.006
Taystee!

45:20.008 --> 45:20.968
Damn!

45:21.719 --> 45:25.013
I was wondering where you been hiding.

45:25.097 --> 45:26.390
Oh.

45:27.141 --> 45:28.684
Bring it in.

45:29.476 --> 45:30.602
Oh, boy.

45:32.312 --> 45:34.648
-Oh.

45:35.566 --> 45:38.402
Well, you know,
same thing I was doing for you.

45:38.485 --> 45:42.614
Phones, filing, appointments.

45:43.699 --> 45:47.578
Which is funny,
'cause I don't see your name on the list.

45:48.412 --> 45:52.332
Oh. Yeah, it's an impromptu visit.
I was hoping to talk to her.

45:52.416 --> 45:55.669
Yeah. Well, she's in a meeting.
Can you wait?

45:56.170 --> 45:57.463
-Sure.
-All right.

45:58.172 --> 45:59.173
Ah.

46:03.051 --> 46:04.344
It's really great to see you.

46:05.304 --> 46:07.931
I've been thinking about you lately,

46:08.599 --> 46:13.187
ever since I got Tamika on that 2:00 p.m.
green tea and gummy bear plan.

46:13.270 --> 46:16.148
Snaps you out of that midday slump
without keeping you up all night.

46:16.231 --> 46:19.276
Just don't tell her.
She thinks I invented it.

46:19.359 --> 46:22.029
Mum's the word. And you're welcome.

46:25.449 --> 46:28.744
Wanna thank you, Mr. Caputo...

46:33.123 --> 46:34.917
for everything you've done for me.

46:42.299 --> 46:43.759
I wish it could've been more.

46:46.887 --> 46:52.100
Well, my lawyer's reviewing
some new evidence, so we'll see.

46:52.434 --> 46:54.978
That's incredible.
-Yeah.

46:55.062 --> 46:58.106
Uh, see, didn't I say never stop fighting?

46:58.440 --> 47:00.651
Only until my ears were bleeding.

47:00.734 --> 47:02.528
Professor Caputo.

47:03.070 --> 47:04.738
What brings you here?

47:05.322 --> 47:07.449
You have a few minutes?

47:08.033 --> 47:10.452
-As long as it's not bad news.

47:10.536 --> 47:13.789
'Cause my GED teacher
just up and quit on me.

47:14.414 --> 47:16.917
Apparently, he has a sick grandmother
in Illinois.

47:17.000 --> 47:18.877
-Girl.

47:18.961 --> 47:22.965
The students really loved him.
Almost as much as they love you.

47:24.216 --> 47:26.176
You know what?

47:27.010 --> 47:28.220
It's not important.

47:28.303 --> 47:31.807
And I forgot I told Fig I'd meet her
for an early lunch.

47:32.224 --> 47:34.393
So, I'll see you soon.

47:35.227 --> 47:36.728
Her grandma sick, too?

47:36.812 --> 47:40.566
Oh. No. Really, we'll talk another time.

47:40.941 --> 47:41.942
If you say so.

47:42.025 --> 47:44.361
Yeah, it's fine. It wasn't important.

47:45.863 --> 47:48.490
-It's good to see you.
-And you.

47:56.123 --> 47:58.917
And then, we did a guided meditation
to the spirit world

47:59.001 --> 48:01.128
where we asked Freckles
to share her wisdom.

48:01.461 --> 48:04.214
I realize I am among
the fairest of our species,

48:04.298 --> 48:06.508
-but that is some white people bullshit.
-I know.

48:06.884 --> 48:08.594
But as woo-woo as it was,

48:09.428 --> 48:13.015
it was actually... kind of transformative.

48:13.098 --> 48:14.600
The songs of truth and wonder?

48:14.683 --> 48:16.643
Or the part where you murdered
Shaun the Sheep's cousin?

48:16.727 --> 48:20.355
I'm serious. When I was in the woods
burying a lamb's fetus with Zelda,

48:21.189 --> 48:22.357
it was very powerful.

48:23.108 --> 48:24.735
I thought Neri and Maia were with you.

48:24.818 --> 48:26.862
Mmm, Neri took two Xanax and passed out,

48:26.945 --> 48:30.115
and Maia got very into butchering
and stayed to break down the body.

48:30.532 --> 48:32.743
So, where did this Zelda come from?

48:32.826 --> 48:35.746
Maia's friend. And she was my roommate
for the weekend.

48:36.371 --> 48:37.247
Roommate?

48:37.664 --> 48:39.958
Yeah, and bunk beds.

48:40.751 --> 48:43.378
Alex, I can't get away from bunk beds.

48:44.087 --> 48:46.757
Anyway, it was like,

48:47.841 --> 48:52.512
before the retreat, I was hiding
a part of myself from the world.

48:52.596 --> 48:55.974
I mean, I was still being myself,
but only a part of myself

48:56.058 --> 49:00.312
because I was so afraid
of what other people would think

49:00.395 --> 49:02.064
if they knew about the prison part.

49:02.147 --> 49:04.274
Sounds like coming out all over again,

49:04.358 --> 49:07.361
only with fewer relatives telling you
how much they love Ellen.

49:07.444 --> 49:11.406
It's like this weight has been lifted off
of my shoulders.

49:12.032 --> 49:13.617
And the urge to act out...

49:15.494 --> 49:16.703
is totally gone.

49:17.913 --> 49:19.289
Congratulations.

49:19.373 --> 49:24.002
And I just wanna thank you
for offering to open up our relationship.

49:24.795 --> 49:27.506
But it turns out, having non-orgasmic sex

49:27.589 --> 49:30.926
with an assortment of randos
is not an itch I need to scratch.

49:31.635 --> 49:32.886
How many randos were there?

49:33.553 --> 49:34.846
Um...

49:34.930 --> 49:37.683
There was the Willie Nelson kush addict
from my NA meeting,

49:37.766 --> 49:39.184
I know, very specific,

49:39.267 --> 49:41.979
and the thoroughly-waxed finance guy
from Goldman Sachs.

49:42.062 --> 49:43.981
I think his name was Kyle.

49:44.064 --> 49:48.443
I know we said we'd share everything.
I've changed my mind. Less is more.

49:48.527 --> 49:49.820
Okay.

49:49.903 --> 49:52.739
But I don't want to hide anything
from anyone anymore.

50:00.580 --> 50:03.125
Please don't tell me that
bitch is still making you sell for her.

50:03.458 --> 50:06.044
No, thankfully. Not anymore.

50:09.297 --> 50:13.677
Pick up the pace, Gonzales.
<i>Señoritas</i> in ICE need their tacos.

50:14.553 --> 50:18.223
It's Ms. Gonzales to you.
And tacos are on Tuesday.

50:18.306 --> 50:19.224
Duh.

50:20.267 --> 50:21.643
Aren't you missing one?

50:21.727 --> 50:24.479
-Reznikov's in C-Block.
-I meant Morello.

50:24.896 --> 50:26.857
<i>Mademoiselle</i> Nichols,

50:27.399 --> 50:30.152
any idea
where the honorable Ms. Morello might be?

50:30.235 --> 50:32.029
Do I look like her keeper?

50:32.112 --> 50:34.322
Can we go already?
I have a lot of work to do over there.

50:34.406 --> 50:35.907
Yeah, so do I.

50:35.991 --> 50:38.827
Drive these three down
to the International House of Pancakes.

50:38.910 --> 50:40.662
I'll track down Ms. Morello.

50:41.038 --> 50:43.999
Actually, she goes by Mrs. Muccio now.

50:44.416 --> 50:45.792
Or did she hyphenate?

50:54.968 --> 50:56.803
Anyone got eyes on Morello?

51:16.782 --> 51:20.660
<i>♪ Reach out</i>

51:21.328 --> 51:24.289
Hey. We were wondering when you'd be back.

51:24.372 --> 51:26.333
I didn't think
you'd get far without this.

51:26.416 --> 51:27.918
And your phone's been blowing up.

51:35.801 --> 51:38.512
Don't worry, your cash is all there.

51:38.595 --> 51:40.806
Not that we're expecting
a reward or anything.

52:10.752 --> 52:12.295
Jesus Christ, Lorna. What the hell are you doing
all the way out here?

52:15.966 --> 52:18.260
-I'm not sure.

52:18.677 --> 52:20.846
Well, you had to come out here
for a reason.

52:21.596 --> 52:23.181
Did Tony bring you out here?

52:24.474 --> 52:25.934
I think I might've walked.

52:27.060 --> 52:29.980
Are you fucking kidding me?
We're 15 miles from home!

52:32.274 --> 52:33.733
I don't know, Franny.

52:34.568 --> 52:36.444
I can't remember anything.

52:40.448 --> 52:41.616
Hey. Hey.

52:44.411 --> 52:46.246
It's bad enough losing my kids.

52:47.372 --> 52:50.250
I can't stop thinking about them
at that custody hearing.

52:52.169 --> 52:55.505
Feeling like their mother
didn't even bother

52:56.548 --> 52:59.176
showing up to fight for them.

53:02.095 --> 53:04.389
What if they think I don't care?

53:05.390 --> 53:06.933
That I ran off
and abandoned them?

53:07.017 --> 53:10.395
They'll never think that.
You're their mama.

53:10.478 --> 53:14.566
They're so young, Blanca.
They don't understand all of this.

53:14.649 --> 53:16.693
Hmm. Neither do I.

53:17.277 --> 53:21.865
I can't even call them to say
how much I love them,

53:21.948 --> 53:24.743
because ICE won't tell me where they are.

53:36.671 --> 53:37.964
Hey, don't worry.

53:39.549 --> 53:42.219
We'll figure out a way
for you to talk to your kids.

53:44.804 --> 53:46.932
<i>Gracias,</i> Blanca.

53:50.977 --> 53:52.771
Hey, rise and shine, son!

53:55.106 --> 53:56.066
Fuck you!

54:19.881 --> 54:20.799
Psst.

54:21.925 --> 54:24.719
So, I was doing some research last night,

54:24.803 --> 54:29.140
and not to be the dumb American who thinks
she can solve the world's problems,

54:29.224 --> 54:32.644
but if you're open to it, so to speak...

54:34.104 --> 54:35.855
I'd like to try to colonize your G-spot.

54:37.023 --> 54:40.443
That is not dumb.
It's full-blown imperialist.

54:40.527 --> 54:45.073
Honestly, I am not trying
to push anything. I just, um...

54:45.907 --> 54:47.367
I wanna make you happy.

54:47.450 --> 54:50.245
Braver explorers than you
have died trying.

54:50.328 --> 54:54.666
Well, if you wanna discover the New World,
that's a risk you gotta take.

55:03.967 --> 55:06.886
Morello's not in the law library
or the multi-purpose room.

55:06.970 --> 55:12.475
Inmates, back to your cells, now!
I'm talking to you, Ms. Tawney.

55:12.559 --> 55:15.937
It's Mx. Tawney.
Why you gotta make it about gender?

55:17.022 --> 55:19.357
I don't know if they're hers,
but I found 'em in the south hallway

55:19.441 --> 55:21.568
about two feet from the wall,
midway down the hall.

55:21.651 --> 55:25.447
One was face-down, the other crossed it
in a T-pattern, sole facing up.

55:25.530 --> 55:28.950
Fuck! All right, somebody call Ward.
We gotta go on lockdown.

55:30.910 --> 55:31.995
