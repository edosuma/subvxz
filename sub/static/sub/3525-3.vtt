00:09.400 --> 00:12.300
# You woke up
this morning #

00:12.335 --> 00:14.700
# Got yourself a gun #

00:14.800 --> 00:19.900
# Your momma always said
you'd be the Chosen One #

00:20.000 --> 00:22.300
# She said you're...
you're one in a million #

00:22.335 --> 00:24.565
# You've got
to burn to shine #

00:24.600 --> 00:27.600
# But you were
born under a bad sign #

00:27.700 --> 00:30.450
# With a blue moon
in your eyes #

00:30.485 --> 00:33.292
# When you
woke up this morning #

00:33.327 --> 00:36.313
# And all that love
had gone #

00:36.348 --> 00:39.300
# Your papa never
told you about #

00:39.335 --> 00:41.765
# Right and wrong #

00:41.800 --> 00:44.100
# But you're...
you're looking good, baby #

00:44.135 --> 00:46.667
# I believe that
you're feeling fine #

00:46.702 --> 00:49.200
# Shame about it,
born under a bad sign #

00:49.235 --> 00:51.665
# With a blue moon
in your eyes #

00:51.700 --> 00:54.900
- # So sing it now #
- # Woke up this morning #

00:55.000 --> 00:58.500
# Got a blue moon...
got a blue moon in your eyes, yeah #

00:58.600 --> 01:00.600
# Woke up this morning #

01:02.600 --> 01:05.300
# You say you woke up
this morning #

01:05.334 --> 01:08.000
# The world
turned upside down #

01:08.100 --> 01:10.300
# Lordy, well,
things ain't been the same #

01:10.335 --> 01:13.565
# Since the blues
walked in our town #

01:13.600 --> 01:16.000
# But you're... but you're
one in a million #

01:16.035 --> 01:18.400
# 'Cause you got that
shotgun shine #

01:18.500 --> 01:21.500
# Shame about it,
born under a bad sign #

01:21.535 --> 01:24.500
# With a blue moon
in your eyes, yeah #

01:24.535 --> 01:27.465
# Woke up
this morning #

01:27.500 --> 01:30.665
- # Uh-huh #
- # And got yourself a gun #

01:30.700 --> 01:33.700

- # Got yourself a gun #

01:33.735 --> 01:36.200

01:45.700 --> 01:48.900
Here he is,
Mr. Clean.

01:52.800 --> 01:56.000
- Want some coffee?
- Where's your dirties?

01:56.035 --> 01:57.800
I'll get 'em.

02:08.500 --> 02:10.365
What?

02:10.400 --> 02:12.850
I don't know.
It's... it's...

02:12.885 --> 02:15.092
it's hard seeing you
like this.

02:15.127 --> 02:17.300
What, working,
with a real job?

02:19.700 --> 02:23.000
It's like I've been telling Feech,
it's been a long strange trip.

02:24.300 --> 02:25.700
Feech?

02:30.200 --> 02:32.900
Anyway, it's the luck
of the draw, that shit.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.600
Could've just as easily
been me that went away.

02:37.300 --> 02:40.150
Come on, I was gonna be there
that night of the hijack.

02:40.185 --> 02:43.000
Well, it ain't like you
came away totally unscathed.

02:43.100 --> 02:47.100
No, a couple of goons jumped me
and cut my head open.

02:47.135 --> 02:49.800
I couldn't go.
Still...

02:49.900 --> 02:53.800
They could've killed ya.
You ended up in the E.R.

02:53.835 --> 02:56.600
Got 16 stitches.
You got 15 years.

02:56.700 --> 02:58.600
You always were
a lucky fuck.

02:58.700 --> 03:00.600
Well, that's not
completely true.

03:00.700 --> 03:03.300
I got a lotta sorrows
in my life.

03:03.335 --> 03:05.700
Like him for example.

03:19.900 --> 03:21.865
Thanks for lunch.

03:21.900 --> 03:24.800
Stick with me, kid, I'll have ya eating
lunch like that every day.

03:26.300 --> 03:28.600
I'm serious about
this massage therapy.

03:28.700 --> 03:32.100
Well, you should keep a square job
like that for appearances.

03:32.135 --> 03:33.965
Look at me
with the bakery.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.500
I told my cousin
I wanna stay a civilian.

03:37.535 --> 03:39.800
Ah, yes.
The boy king.

03:39.900 --> 03:44.200
Can I trust you if I talk to you
frankly about him?

03:57.500 --> 04:01.000
- What are you doing?
- I gotta make a stop.

04:17.600 --> 04:19.865
What the fuck you doing?

04:19.899 --> 04:22.600
- Excuse me?
- What the fuck are you doing?

04:22.635 --> 04:24.300
I'm trimming a lawn.

04:24.400 --> 04:26.800
My nephew does the lawns
in this neighborhood.

04:26.835 --> 04:29.200
I been working this
neighborhood for 26 years.

04:29.300 --> 04:32.800
Are you fucking deaf?
I said my nephew has this area,

04:32.900 --> 04:37.200
- Gary La Manna.
- Fuck off, huh? I'm busy here.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.365
You want me
to fuck off?!

04:44.400 --> 04:48.100
How about I fuck off all over
your stupid fucking face,

04:48.135 --> 04:50.500
you fucking mutt? Huh?

04:58.900 --> 05:01.100
You don't work
this neighborhood!

05:03.300 --> 05:05.400
Jesus Christ,
we're on parole.

05:05.435 --> 05:07.900
What the fuck
you doing?

05:13.800 --> 05:17.000
Anthony said the cable
box has to be on.

05:17.035 --> 05:18.665
It's on,
I'm doing it.

05:18.700 --> 05:21.200
But let me tell ya,
our glass house couples

05:21.235 --> 05:23.700
could probably decorate
in about 24 hours.

05:23.800 --> 05:26.000
They have to,
each week.

05:30.100 --> 05:32.450
Tony's whole life
was horses...

05:32.485 --> 05:34.892
- No, it's not her.
- That's Judy!

05:34.927 --> 05:37.265
- No, it's not Judy!
- The fuck?

05:37.300 --> 05:39.900
- Yes, it is, of course it is.
- Why am I on there?

05:40.000 --> 05:43.065
- What?
- Holy shit. I've seen Judy!

05:43.100 --> 05:46.250
- That's not you.
- What's that, my trial?

05:46.285 --> 05:48.892
...know the eyes.
- No, I do know the eyes...

05:48.927 --> 05:51.313
Come on!
I've seen my daughter call her Judy!

05:51.348 --> 05:53.700
- Sweet Judy Brown Eyes...
- That's Bobby.

05:53.800 --> 05:56.500
What the fuck is this?

05:56.600 --> 06:01.300
Junior, it's not you,
it's a TV program, a movie.

06:01.400 --> 06:03.900
Judy, what?

06:10.900 --> 06:13.500
Ton', he's here.

06:21.900 --> 06:25.200
- Tony, hey, thanks for seeing me.
- How are ya?

06:25.300 --> 06:27.200
How are you?

06:30.100 --> 06:33.300
You want something?
Coffee, bialy?

06:33.400 --> 06:34.900
No, I'm good,
thank you.

06:39.100 --> 06:41.600
What's on your mind?

06:43.800 --> 06:47.100
Well, honestly, I'll get
right to the point.

06:47.135 --> 06:49.300
As regards
to your uncle,

06:49.400 --> 06:51.100
'cause of the promotion
and all,

06:51.200 --> 06:53.400
I kinda thought I'd be
out on the street more.

06:53.500 --> 06:57.350
Staying off the street
nowadays is a good thing, no?

06:57.385 --> 07:01.200
- It's a joke.
- I know, I mean I'm not complaining.

07:01.300 --> 07:03.265
It's just it's over a year,
and I'm still

07:03.300 --> 07:06.100
- picking up prescriptions.
- What do ya need, money?

07:06.135 --> 07:08.100
All I want is
a chance to earn.

07:08.200 --> 07:10.500
I mean, I'm happy to do it,
it's just 40 minutes

07:10.600 --> 07:12.065
I spent at Rite Aids yesterday

07:12.100 --> 07:14.900
getting him some stool softener
that was on sale.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.800
With Jan and the kids
to feed now...

07:17.835 --> 07:20.600
How's she doing anyways,
my sister?

07:20.635 --> 07:23.265
She sleeps a lot.
It's hard.

07:23.300 --> 07:25.200
Still with
the Epstein-Barr, huh?

07:25.235 --> 07:27.100
It's tough on her.
I don't know...

07:27.200 --> 07:29.300
two kids,
a ready-made family.

07:30.800 --> 07:33.000
She's prone
to depression, frankly.

07:33.035 --> 07:34.600
Mmm.

07:34.700 --> 07:37.250
I mean, not that
I have any regrets.

07:37.285 --> 07:39.800
No, no, course not,
she's a good kid.

07:40.900 --> 07:42.800
Look, Bobby,
marriage...

07:44.300 --> 07:47.700
or any partnership for that matter,
is a give and a take.

07:50.800 --> 07:53.100
All right, look.

07:53.200 --> 07:55.565
I hear what you're saying,

07:55.600 --> 07:58.000
but the truth
is I depend on you.

07:58.035 --> 08:00.965
Beppy, Tommy...
come on.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.865
You're the only one
I can trust over there.

08:03.900 --> 08:07.100
And believe it or not, it's important
to me that he's cared for.

08:12.100 --> 08:15.300
All right, let me figure out
how to take care of you.

08:15.335 --> 08:18.500
Maybe you could make more
collections or something.

08:18.535 --> 08:21.400
Thanks, Ton'.
I appreciate it.

08:21.435 --> 08:23.300
Yeah, all right.

08:24.600 --> 08:26.500
All right.

08:31.800 --> 08:34.465
And Friday we have fish,

08:34.500 --> 08:37.400
if you're Catholic,
so that's nice.

08:37.434 --> 08:39.400
Sounds like the Ritz.

08:39.500 --> 08:41.200
Ya gotta see her,
Aunt Mary,

08:41.299 --> 08:43.299
she's the belle
of the ball over there.

08:43.335 --> 08:46.000
Here, Ma,
rest those dogs.

08:52.900 --> 08:56.500
Hey, what's going on?
Nobody cutting the lawn?

08:56.535 --> 08:59.117
Oh, Madonn'.
Mr. Vitro, the gardener,

08:59.152 --> 09:01.700
somebody beat him up,
broke his arm.

09:01.800 --> 09:04.800
- God forbid.
- Sal Vitro?

09:04.900 --> 09:07.800
- Who beat him up?
- Some men in a Cadillac.

09:07.835 --> 09:09.665
He was mowing a lawn
on Kimball Street.

09:09.700 --> 09:12.500
The man said he didn't want him
in the neighborhood.

09:12.600 --> 09:15.200
Poor Sal, what
a nice man he is.

09:15.300 --> 09:18.700
He put my garbage cans out
every time he cut my grass.

09:18.735 --> 09:20.800
What's his name,
Aunt Mary?

09:20.900 --> 09:24.400
- Salvatore Vitro.
- Ma, the guy that beat him up.

09:25.700 --> 09:28.600
Man came by and said
he was gonna cut the lawns.

09:28.635 --> 09:31.400
I said, "No,
I want Mr. Vitro. "

09:31.500 --> 09:34.850
"E. Gary La Manna,
Landscaping. "

09:34.885 --> 09:38.200
- Do you know him?
- Eat your scones.

09:38.300 --> 09:40.300
I'll straighten it out.

09:42.400 --> 09:45.900
95.5, WPLJ in Brooklyn.

09:47.100 --> 09:51.300
- Sorry, we're not open.
- What, not open?

09:51.400 --> 09:54.400
A man in your position turning
away fucking business now?

09:54.435 --> 09:56.600
I didn't know
it was you, Lorraine.

09:56.635 --> 09:59.500
Here ya go.
That's most of it.

10:02.600 --> 10:05.800
Let me ask you
a question, Dan.

10:05.900 --> 10:09.100
Say I'm some big nigger standing
here instead of a woman,

10:09.135 --> 10:11.100
you still gonna tell me
you got most of it?

10:11.200 --> 10:13.200
Let's go, chop-chop,
pay the woman.

10:22.600 --> 10:26.300
Phil, hey. I was just
thinking about you.

10:26.400 --> 10:28.300
Those Islander tickets,
right?

10:28.335 --> 10:30.500
How about
this humidity?

10:30.535 --> 10:33.665
Hey! Hey!

10:33.700 --> 10:38.065
- Guys, please, whatever this is...
- Shut up.

10:38.100 --> 10:41.500
Two times you were told
to kick up to fucking Johnny Sack.

10:41.535 --> 10:43.900
And what do you do?
You kick up to Little Carmine?

10:43.935 --> 10:46.265
- Tape her.
- No! No!

10:46.300 --> 10:49.300
Little Carmine, he was
my father's friend!

10:49.400 --> 10:51.900
Philly, Joey, look...
okay, okay, okay.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.200
You're right, I'm sorry.
I'll pay you, okay?

10:54.300 --> 10:57.200
I'll do anything you want.
I'll suck your cock, okay?

10:57.235 --> 10:59.465
All of you guys!

10:59.500 --> 11:01.900
- You'll suck our cocks?
- Yeah!

11:02.000 --> 11:05.265
She any good?

11:05.300 --> 11:07.700
What am I asking you for?
You probably showed her how.

11:07.735 --> 11:09.265
- Shut up.
- Please, guys.

11:09.300 --> 11:12.600
Relax.
This'll muffle the shot.

11:14.400 --> 11:16.800
Adios, you fucking skank.

11:23.100 --> 11:25.700
Hey, look at this, Joey.

11:25.800 --> 11:27.800
Today's her lucky day.

11:27.900 --> 11:31.500
Only made it to the R's.

11:31.600 --> 11:34.500
Next time,
there'll be no next time.

11:34.535 --> 11:36.300
Come on.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.700
Take as long
as you like, no rush.

11:42.735 --> 11:44.565
I've got my
"Times Crossword"

11:44.600 --> 11:46.300
and Agnes here will
get you anything you need.

11:46.400 --> 11:48.400
Thanks, Mel.

11:48.500 --> 11:50.500
So how's it
being home, Angelo?

11:50.535 --> 11:52.500
Enjoying living
with your daughter?

11:53.900 --> 11:56.800
It's like paradise.
I eat like a pharaoh,

11:56.900 --> 12:00.000
- I got my own room, cable TV.
- I have cable.

12:00.100 --> 12:02.100
My grandson,
he asked me... he says,

12:02.200 --> 12:04.565
how come he never met
his grandpa before?

12:04.600 --> 12:07.300
I said, "Because Grandpa's
been in Special Forces. "

12:07.335 --> 12:09.100
First he was
afraid of me,

12:09.200 --> 12:11.400
but I said, "Come on,
we'll get some ice cream.

12:11.435 --> 12:13.600
- We'll go to the park. It'll be... "
- Well anyway,

12:13.700 --> 12:16.100
- here we all are.
- Right.

12:16.200 --> 12:19.200
I called you boys because Lorraine
calls me and she said

12:19.235 --> 12:22.017
there's a situation in our family
that's gotten outta hand

12:22.052 --> 12:24.800
- with John and Little Carmine.
- This fucking Johnny,

12:24.835 --> 12:27.117
he wouldn't even let
the maggots get on Carmine

12:27.152 --> 12:29.400
before he's telling me
to kick up direct to him.

12:29.500 --> 12:31.900
Problem is Carmine
never named a successor.

12:31.935 --> 12:33.700
We all assumed
it'd be Johnny

12:33.800 --> 12:37.200
'cause the son's down in Miami
with the discos and the whatnot.

12:37.300 --> 12:39.400
He's grabbing
with both hands, John.

12:39.500 --> 12:41.265
This could get ugly.

12:41.300 --> 12:44.900
There's a lotta potential
for bloodshed.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.700
Potential?
They almost killed us.

12:47.800 --> 12:49.800
Jason, men are
talking here.

12:51.700 --> 12:54.165
Now you're
close to John.

12:54.200 --> 12:56.700
- You have any ideas?
- What are you asking him for?

12:56.735 --> 12:59.200
He never even had the makings
of a varsity athlete.

13:01.800 --> 13:04.200
Your point being
what, Junior?

13:04.300 --> 13:06.800
Oh, forget it,
he's just breaking balls.

13:09.400 --> 13:11.450
All right,
one thought I had

13:11.485 --> 13:13.500
in the interest
of harmony,

13:13.600 --> 13:16.300
maybe there could be
a power-sharing situation.

13:16.335 --> 13:18.665
The Sopranos
have two bosses.

13:18.700 --> 13:21.200
That's not all it's cracked up to be,
believe you me.

13:21.235 --> 13:24.000
Let's not get into that
right now, okay?

13:26.800 --> 13:28.900
What I was thinking
was three bosses,

13:28.935 --> 13:31.400
a triumvir-thing,
like Caesar.

13:31.500 --> 13:34.900
- Little Carmine, Johnny and you.
- I'm retired.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.300
You were Carmine's consigliere
for over 30 years.

13:37.400 --> 13:39.900
If it wasn't for that construction beef
down in Yonkers

13:40.000 --> 13:41.700
it'd be you running
that family today.

13:41.800 --> 13:44.700
- Things happen how they happen.
- Think about it.

13:44.735 --> 13:46.665
Doesn't have to be
9:00 to 5:00.

13:46.700 --> 13:49.265
You could still take
your grandson to the park.

13:49.300 --> 13:52.700
Things get heavy, you're just another
voice to weigh in.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.100
And John still does
better financially

13:56.200 --> 13:58.500
than he ever did
under Carmine.

14:02.100 --> 14:05.600
There he is.
Salvatore, my Dali.

14:13.900 --> 14:15.865
My aunt told me
about it.

14:15.900 --> 14:18.100
I mean, what'd I ever
do to this guy?

14:18.200 --> 14:20.750
They released
these fucks from the can.

14:20.785 --> 14:23.300
Obviously,
he wasn't rehabilitated.

14:23.400 --> 14:25.500
It's my livelihood.

14:25.600 --> 14:28.800
I don't have a yard no more,
Sally, I'm in a condo.

14:28.835 --> 14:30.967
Otherwise, you know,
I'd have ya out there

14:31.002 --> 14:33.100
with your snippers,
even with your bum wing.

14:33.200 --> 14:35.600
My wife,
at this point...

14:36.900 --> 14:39.100
she's got me thinking
about going to the cops.

14:39.200 --> 14:42.200
What are you talking about?
Where are you from?

14:44.300 --> 14:47.300
- I don't know what to do.
- You got friends, don't ya?

14:47.400 --> 14:50.100
- I always steered clear of stuff.
- What stuff?

14:50.200 --> 14:52.165
I go, I talk
to the guy for ya.

14:52.200 --> 14:54.900
Get you back your stops.
I know him.

14:56.100 --> 14:57.900
Yeah?

14:58.000 --> 15:01.400
So you give me a token,
I don't know, couple percent.

15:06.800 --> 15:09.100
Thanks, Paulie.

15:12.600 --> 15:15.000
This one
and the next one.

15:28.100 --> 15:31.200
There he is,
the king of breadsticks.

15:31.300 --> 15:33.800
I'll give you a breadstick up your ass.
Come here, you.

15:36.200 --> 15:38.800
Come on, sit down.

15:42.600 --> 15:45.600
So, how's the kid,
huh, Tony?

15:45.635 --> 15:48.367
He's good, you know.
But ask me,

15:48.402 --> 15:51.065
he should've
stood with Carmela.

15:51.100 --> 15:53.565
Some men need wives, huh?
Tell you when to shit

15:53.600 --> 15:56.100
- and when to scratch your ass.
- Who needs them, huh?

15:56.200 --> 15:58.600
What can I do
for you, Paul?

15:58.700 --> 16:02.300
I got a guy, I think you
may have run into him,

16:02.400 --> 16:04.100
gardener name
of Sal Vitro.

16:04.135 --> 16:06.565
Does my aunt's grass.

16:06.600 --> 16:09.500
He says your nephew's moving
into his neighborhood,

16:09.535 --> 16:11.765
- Franklin Parkway.
- His neighborhood?

16:11.800 --> 16:13.900
He's been working there
since back when I lived there.

16:13.935 --> 16:16.665
Anyway, I'm here putting
in a word for the kid.

16:16.700 --> 16:20.500
So do me a favor, huh?
You and your nephew over there, lay off.

16:23.600 --> 16:27.200
- Hey, biscotti?
- No.

16:27.300 --> 16:29.400
You know Mr. Jerry,

16:29.500 --> 16:32.000
the fruit who owns
those hair salons, huh?

16:32.035 --> 16:34.065
He came to me
the other day,

16:34.100 --> 16:36.400
he asked me to take
his action on the Knicks.

16:38.000 --> 16:41.000
Jerry's my fucking customer,
for years now.

16:41.035 --> 16:43.065
Which is why
I told him no.

16:43.100 --> 16:46.700
This gardener, he cut the hair
on your balls, too?

16:46.735 --> 16:48.265
He's a friend
of my Aunt Mary's.

16:48.300 --> 16:50.265
Which is why he don't
belong to nobody.

16:50.300 --> 16:54.000
What do you know about who belongs
to what? You been away 20 years!

16:54.035 --> 16:57.200
- Which entitles me to earn!
- Which entitles you to shit.

16:57.235 --> 17:00.000
In my book, you get points
for staying outta the can.

17:00.100 --> 17:03.800
Good thing for me, then,
that your book don't mean oogatz to me!

17:03.900 --> 17:06.200
What's yours
is yours, Paulie,

17:06.300 --> 17:08.500
but what ain't
is anybody else's!

17:08.535 --> 17:10.666
Now do yourself
a fucking favor

17:10.702 --> 17:12.800
and get the fuck
outta my store!

17:23.300 --> 17:24.765
So are we picking
Bobby up,

17:24.800 --> 17:26.650
or is he gonna meet
us at Uncle Jun's?

17:26.685 --> 17:28.500
He took the kids
to the 12:00 mass.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
I didn't know
he was religious.

17:32.100 --> 17:35.250
At this point he'll try
anything, I guess.

17:35.285 --> 17:38.365
Bobby Jr. started
wetting his bed again.

17:38.400 --> 17:42.500
- Practically every night.
- Bobby came by to see me the other day.

17:42.535 --> 17:45.000
Really?

17:47.300 --> 17:50.200
So we discuss his career,
I'm his wife.

17:50.300 --> 17:52.865
Sometimes he needs a push.

17:52.900 --> 17:56.400
Junior's your uncle too, in case you
wanna play more of an active role...

17:56.435 --> 17:58.365
I try, believe me.

17:58.400 --> 18:01.900
Despite all the work
I have with my own family.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.500
You know, I cook for Bobby
and the kids every night.

18:08.535 --> 18:10.500
I did Sunday dinner
at my house,

18:10.600 --> 18:12.400
and now I gotta
prepare the starters

18:12.435 --> 18:14.565
and schlep 'em
to Uncle Jun's.

18:14.600 --> 18:16.900
Yeah, Barb's helping out
all the way down from Brewster.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.600
Barbara's kids are normal.

18:20.400 --> 18:23.400
This family stuff,
these Sunday dinners,

18:23.435 --> 18:25.300
they're important,
Janice.

18:27.400 --> 18:30.200
Hey, Jan.
Julio?

18:30.300 --> 18:32.700
- Help me get this order?
- Okay.

18:38.300 --> 18:42.200
You know, every day I understand more
and more what Ma went through.

18:42.235 --> 18:44.265
I mean we bitch about her,
but I tell you,

18:44.300 --> 18:47.800
it is less and less a mystery
why she was the way she was.

18:47.835 --> 18:51.300
- She chose to be that way.
- You don't choose that, Tony.

18:51.400 --> 18:54.965
An ungrateful husband,
selfish kids.

18:55.000 --> 18:58.900
- How's that food that Janice prepared?
- Two more minutes.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.765
Artie's re-sautéing
the mushrooms.

19:00.800 --> 19:03.700
Could I get you a glass of wine,
something to drink?

19:03.735 --> 19:06.500
- No, I'm good.
- I'll have a pinot grigio.

19:11.500 --> 19:13.700
20 minutes,
start the shells.

19:21.600 --> 19:24.200
Just redoing the mushrooms,
two minutes tops.

19:24.300 --> 19:26.600
Well relax, I just...

19:26.635 --> 19:28.900
came in to say hello.

19:34.400 --> 19:38.100
- So how you doing?
- Hanging in.

19:38.200 --> 19:41.900
Heard you were over there
at the Motel 6.

19:41.935 --> 19:43.900
My aunt took
the house back.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.700
I'm moving in with my cousin
at the end of the month.

19:52.200 --> 19:55.465
Look, if you want,
I'm staying over at my mother's

19:55.500 --> 19:58.300
and the place is empty.
You can bunk with me for a while.

19:59.700 --> 20:01.400
No. Thank you.

20:01.500 --> 20:03.365
I was talking with
my cousin, Tony B,

20:03.400 --> 20:06.000
and he said it's fucking stupid
that we're on the outs.

20:06.035 --> 20:08.700
I'm telling ya, the place
is just sitting there,

20:08.735 --> 20:10.265
two extra bedrooms.

20:10.300 --> 20:13.100
- I don't know.
- Why not?

20:13.135 --> 20:15.865
Artie, we're like brothers.

20:15.900 --> 20:19.000
How long are we gonna
hold a grudge?

20:21.100 --> 20:24.300
- Thanks, Ton'. Thank you very much.
- Yeah, all right.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
All right.

20:35.200 --> 20:37.500
Listen, I gotta talk to you
about your linens...

20:37.535 --> 20:40.165
the napkins and tablecloths,
all that shit.

20:40.200 --> 20:44.200
I got something going.
I think I can save you like 70%.

20:49.800 --> 20:52.050
There's been a lot of
progress to the facade.

20:52.085 --> 20:54.300
In some instances,
all of the paint comes off.

20:54.400 --> 20:56.265
Now tell me, what
product is used...

20:56.300 --> 20:59.800
I don't get these old antique houses.
They're grimy looking.

21:03.500 --> 21:05.365
We gonna eat
today or what?

21:05.400 --> 21:08.400
Barbara and Tom aren't here yet
with the entrees, Uncle Jun'.

21:08.435 --> 21:10.565
When were they
supposed to come?

21:10.600 --> 21:13.800
2:00, I told you
five minutes ago. Here.

21:13.900 --> 21:17.100
Why don't we start on the macaroni?
Everybody come on!

21:18.600 --> 21:22.265
Bolognese has meat,
obviously, the marinara doesn't.

21:22.300 --> 21:26.100
And Barb will be here with the chicken
parm and the veal pizzaiola.

21:28.200 --> 21:31.800
So Anthony, how'd you guys do
against Delbarton last season?

21:31.900 --> 21:35.165
- Not so good, we lost both times.
- It's that line coach.

21:35.200 --> 21:38.600
"Star-Ledger" says Delbarton's gonna
be even tougher this coming year

21:38.635 --> 21:41.600
- with that Chinese kid.
- Your father never had the makings

21:41.700 --> 21:44.300
- of a varsity athlete.
- Oh, what the...?

21:46.800 --> 21:49.750
- What the hell's with you?
- What?

21:49.785 --> 21:52.665
It's not true.
I lettered in football.

21:52.700 --> 21:56.400
- You never played college ball.
- College?

21:56.500 --> 21:59.700
Those guys from Seton Hall
were seven feet tall some of them.

21:59.800 --> 22:02.200
Took an academic
leave anyway.

22:03.500 --> 22:05.800
Small hands,
that was your problem.

22:05.900 --> 22:08.300
Oh yeah, Daddy
always said that.

22:08.400 --> 22:10.900
That's not the point.

22:11.000 --> 22:14.200
What is it with you and this obsession
with this varsity crap?

22:15.500 --> 22:17.265
The other day
you said it.

22:17.300 --> 22:20.700
When I was a kid you told the girl
cousins the same thing, it was hurtful.

22:20.735 --> 22:24.100
- Tony, relax, it's not a big deal.
- It's undermining!

22:24.200 --> 22:27.300
And it's the kinda stuff
I'm teaching my kids not to do.

22:27.335 --> 22:30.100
So I don't wanna hear it again!
End of subject!

22:34.600 --> 22:36.500
Honey, pass me
the ricotta, please.

22:36.535 --> 22:38.100
Hello?

22:38.200 --> 22:41.265
- In here! Hey!
- Hi, sorry we're late.

22:41.300 --> 22:44.200
- The Tappan Zee was a nightmare.
- Checking the trucks again.

22:44.300 --> 22:47.900
Well, sit down and dig into this medley
of pastas that Janice whipped up.

22:47.935 --> 22:51.000
- How you doing, Uncle Jun'?
- I don't like tardiness.

22:51.035 --> 22:54.565
- Let me unwrap these.
- This looks great.

22:54.600 --> 22:57.300
- Thank you.
- So coming down I heard on the radio,

22:57.400 --> 23:00.700
looks like the Jets are gonna grab
that kid from Tulsa, that tight end.

23:00.735 --> 23:03.500
We still get those season tickets,
big brother?

23:03.600 --> 23:05.400
He never had the makings
of a varsity athlete.

23:05.500 --> 23:07.600
- Son of a bitch!
- What?

23:07.700 --> 23:09.950
- Did I just tell you not to say that?!
- Say what?

23:09.985 --> 23:12.200
You don't like the way
I talk, get outta my house!

23:12.235 --> 23:13.400
- Here we go.
- Tony...

23:13.500 --> 23:15.965
No "Tony" shit!
Get your coat, we're leaving.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.600
- I don't have a coat.
- Well then get moving, God damn it!

23:18.635 --> 23:21.165
Will someone please
tell me what's going on?

23:21.200 --> 23:23.900
It's my last Sunday dinner here,
that's what's going on.

23:29.100 --> 23:31.665
Uncle Jun', was that
really necessary?

23:31.700 --> 23:34.900
He's a goddamn hothouse flower,
that's his problem.

23:41.900 --> 23:45.300
Thank you for getting
my TV fixed, Paulie.

23:56.400 --> 23:59.865
It's such a sin.
He fired his Spanish helper.

23:59.900 --> 24:03.100
Took his boy outta college
'cause he couldn't afford it anymore.

24:03.135 --> 24:06.100
He said it's his
last time coming here.

24:14.700 --> 24:17.900
- You speak to the man?
- I'll see you later.

24:39.800 --> 24:41.965
So what's up?

24:42.000 --> 24:45.100
Nothing, I thought
we'd be first in line for opening day.

24:45.200 --> 24:47.300
Peanuts are on me.

24:48.400 --> 24:50.465
Angelo Garepe
came to see me.

24:50.500 --> 24:52.600
- Mm-hmm.
- Lorraine Calluzzo reached out.

24:52.700 --> 24:56.600
Fucking twat.
Didn't you fuck her once?

24:56.635 --> 24:59.017
Yeah, a million years ago.

24:59.052 --> 25:01.400
What, is nothing a secret?

25:01.500 --> 25:03.800
Obviously you wanna
maintain stability,

25:03.900 --> 25:06.200
but having Phil Leotardo
smack your shies around,

25:06.300 --> 25:07.765
is that the smartest thing?

25:07.800 --> 25:10.465
I gotta nip this Little Carmine shit
in the bud.

25:10.500 --> 25:13.700
Otherwise I could see
a lot of people start fucking around.

25:13.735 --> 25:15.965
Power vacuum,
the capos bide their time,

25:16.000 --> 25:18.300
nobody's sure who to pay,
so nobody gets paid.

25:18.400 --> 25:20.600
All right,
I hear you.

25:20.700 --> 25:22.300
No one likes
that cunt anyway.

25:22.400 --> 25:24.900
Any problem, she's "Whack
this one, whack that one".

25:24.935 --> 25:26.800
Never enough body count
for Lorraine.

25:26.900 --> 25:28.800
Fuck her, let her taste
her own medicine!

25:28.900 --> 25:30.300
All right, whatever.

25:31.800 --> 25:33.950
I'll tell you something else.
In large measure,

25:33.985 --> 25:36.442
I blame you for this shit
with Little Carmine.

25:36.477 --> 25:38.865
- What the fuck did I do?
- You legitimized him.

25:38.900 --> 25:41.500
Man of your stature goes to Florida
to see that schmuck?

25:41.535 --> 25:42.800
All right.
Come on, huh?

25:42.900 --> 25:45.600
We both agree that little
Carmine's a fucking asshole,

25:45.635 --> 25:48.300
but the fact is he's got a following
loyal to his old man.

25:48.335 --> 25:50.265
So?

25:50.300 --> 25:53.600
So, Angelo had an idea.

25:53.635 --> 25:55.800
What if...

25:55.900 --> 25:59.300
and he's just floating this
to keep the peace...

25:59.335 --> 26:00.965
Mm-hmm.

26:01.000 --> 26:04.250
What if there was
a power-sharing situation?

26:04.285 --> 26:07.465
- Power sharing.
- You're all in charge equally,

26:07.500 --> 26:10.400
but no major decisions
can be made without a majority of two.

26:10.435 --> 26:11.865
What the fuck?

26:11.900 --> 26:14.850
Hey, this way you're not such
a big target for the feds.

26:14.885 --> 26:17.800
Three of the other families
have this kind of arrangement.

26:17.900 --> 26:21.165
What's this,
the fucking U.N. now?!

26:21.200 --> 26:24.300
- All right forget it! Forget I said it!
- Fuck that!

26:30.000 --> 26:32.165
Everyone deserves
to choose how they feel,

26:32.200 --> 26:35.700
to experience the love,
the joy, the happiness, the passion.

26:35.800 --> 26:38.700
- Where's Junior?
- Upstairs taking a nap.

26:38.800 --> 26:42.200
The garage is open,
his car is gone.

26:44.500 --> 26:48.065
- Where is he?
- I'm telling you, I don't know.

26:48.100 --> 26:51.900
You don't think somebody put
the snatch on him, do you?

26:51.935 --> 26:54.300
When did you
see him last?

26:54.335 --> 26:56.700
An hour ago. Two.

26:57.900 --> 27:02.400
I fell asleep.
Maybe he drove to the store.

27:02.435 --> 27:04.500
His wallet's here,
his watch.

27:04.600 --> 27:07.500
With his bail, he's not allowed
to leave the house anyway.

27:07.600 --> 27:09.200
Junior.

27:26.700 --> 27:29.200
So when they say
they're not interested,

27:29.300 --> 27:33.700
you say, "You're not interested
in keeping kids off drugs?"

27:33.735 --> 27:35.600
What, Shabazz?

27:35.700 --> 27:38.400
Nobody wants them
Turkish taffies.

27:38.500 --> 27:42.300
You push harder.
What did I tell you about profit margin?

27:42.400 --> 27:44.865
- Where's Johnny?
- We closed now.

27:44.900 --> 27:47.700
- Let me talk to Damiano.
- We rented the hall today.

27:47.735 --> 27:49.600
I'm looking for Johnny Soprano,
God damn it.

27:49.635 --> 27:51.565
Hey, this here's a church.

27:51.600 --> 27:53.900
You can't talk
like that in here.

27:53.935 --> 27:56.200
Get out, go on.
We're working here.

27:56.300 --> 27:59.150
- I wanna see Johnny Soprano.
- Ain't no Johnny here.

27:59.185 --> 28:02.542
- I'm his brother. He owns this place.
- Hold up, now.

28:02.577 --> 28:05.900
Back in the day, this was
an Italian neighborhood.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.050
Some fellas
had this place here.

28:08.085 --> 28:10.065
Kept those
vending machines.

28:10.100 --> 28:12.600
Well, there ain't no vending
machines here no more.

28:12.635 --> 28:15.600
Come on, fool, go on.

28:31.800 --> 28:33.900
All right,
Roberta, thanks.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.300
I'm sorry
to bother you.

28:37.500 --> 28:39.700
Bobbi Sanfillipo?

28:39.800 --> 28:42.000
Junior hasn't kept time
with her in years.

28:43.700 --> 28:47.400
- Yeah, I realize that.
- You know, now that I think about it,

28:47.500 --> 28:50.900
Junior was acting a little peculiar
when I got here today.

28:51.000 --> 28:52.900
Said he wanted
to see Johnny.

28:52.935 --> 28:55.065
What Johnny?

28:55.100 --> 28:57.500
- His brother?
- I don't know.

28:57.600 --> 29:00.700
Also there the other day,
we were watching the TV,

29:00.800 --> 29:04.100
he thought he saw himself
on one of the programs.

29:05.600 --> 29:08.800
We have got
the dishwashing liquid...

29:08.835 --> 29:11.400
concentrated
dishwashing liquid.

29:11.500 --> 29:13.700
No gloves, it's all-natural,
no chemicals.

29:13.735 --> 29:15.265
- Hello?
- It's me.

29:15.300 --> 29:18.100
- Did you drop off the drycleaning?
- Your uncle's missing.

29:18.200 --> 29:20.500
He took his car.
He didn't call you, did he?

29:20.535 --> 29:23.065
- No.
- Where the hell is he?

29:23.100 --> 29:26.300
He's like an old woman.
He's probably gossiping with a neighbor.

29:26.335 --> 29:28.500
Did you check
the Ramirez's next door?

29:28.600 --> 29:31.400
I'm afraid he
might've wandered.

29:31.435 --> 29:34.017
My grandfather did this.

29:34.052 --> 29:36.426
Maybe you better
call Tony.

29:36.461 --> 29:38.800
I can't just
dump this on Tony.

29:38.835 --> 29:40.465
I gotta find him.

29:40.500 --> 29:42.565
I need you to come here
in case he comes back.

29:42.600 --> 29:46.100
- Bobby, I just can't...
- I need your help here! Jesus Christ!

29:46.200 --> 29:48.600
Sometimes I think I love
Junior more than you do!

29:59.000 --> 30:02.500
We may know that there are
five essentials for victory:

30:02.535 --> 30:05.800
One, he will win
who knows when to fight

30:05.835 --> 30:08.000
and when not to fight;

30:08.100 --> 30:11.300
Two, he will win
who knows how to...

30:22.800 --> 30:26.200
- You Gary?
- I'm Jimmy.

30:26.235 --> 30:28.267
Gary's up there.

30:28.302 --> 30:30.265
Hey, come down here!

30:30.300 --> 30:33.000
- What?
- I said get down here!

30:33.035 --> 30:35.200
I wanna talk to you!

30:37.100 --> 30:40.500
- What do you want?
- I'm a friend of Sal Vitro's.

30:40.535 --> 30:42.500
My aunt lives
on this street.

30:42.535 --> 30:43.865
So?

30:43.900 --> 30:46.000
So I'm guessing Sal Vitro
used to do this yard.

30:46.035 --> 30:48.665
- A lotta things used to be.
- Maybe so,

30:48.700 --> 30:51.200
but you're gonna make good
on his busted arm.

30:51.235 --> 30:53.100
Oh yeah? Why am I
gonna do that?

30:53.200 --> 30:55.300
'Cause I said so,
that's why.

30:55.400 --> 30:58.700
- Eat shit, pal.
- Why don't you take a walk, huh?

31:18.300 --> 31:20.700
Give me your wallet,
you prick.

31:28.600 --> 31:31.365
This and the mower's
a down payment.

31:31.400 --> 31:35.400
By next Tuesday I want Sal Vitro's
whole orthopedist bill paid.

31:35.435 --> 31:37.465
Let's call it $1,200.

31:37.500 --> 31:39.765
On top of that,
from now on I get 10%

31:39.800 --> 31:41.465
of whatever you make
in this neighborhood.

31:41.500 --> 31:45.000
- You motherfucker!
- Shut up or I'll give you a crack.

32:13.300 --> 32:16.500
- Time is it?
- Don't worry, we'll take the tunnel.

32:16.535 --> 32:18.665
All right,
this meeting today,

32:18.700 --> 32:22.000
we're trying to nail down a new
contractor now with Massarone gone.

32:22.035 --> 32:24.900
- That office park by Troy Hills?
- Listen...

32:24.935 --> 32:26.965
and this is
very important...

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
if any of this shit
with Little Carmine

32:29.035 --> 32:31.000
and Johnny
comes up, you clam up.

32:31.100 --> 32:33.700
- You got it, Ton'.
- Say nothing.

32:33.800 --> 32:37.700
'Cause you say
the wrong thing...

32:41.300 --> 32:43.300
- What?
- Tony, it's me.

32:43.400 --> 32:46.900
Listen, it's your uncle.
He's gone.

32:48.400 --> 32:51.400
- You mean he's dead?
- No, no, no, no.

32:51.500 --> 32:53.300
We think he might've
wandered off.

32:53.400 --> 32:55.300
You know, I didn't
wanna call you

32:55.400 --> 32:57.700
- but it's been a couple hours now.
- Fuck him.

32:57.735 --> 32:59.567
He said he was
going to see Johnny.

32:59.602 --> 33:01.400
You think he might've
meant your dad?

33:01.500 --> 33:03.865
- What?
- He's wandering, Ton'.

33:03.900 --> 33:06.100
He can wander off
the Palisades for all I care.

33:06.200 --> 33:08.200
He's fucking dead to me.

33:28.600 --> 33:30.565
I called you
almost an hour ago.

33:30.600 --> 33:33.300
- Where the hell have you been?
- Hello?

33:33.400 --> 33:35.000
I was picking up
your daughter.

33:35.035 --> 33:36.767
Stay here,
I'm going out.

33:36.802 --> 33:38.500
Where the hell
is Tommy?

33:38.600 --> 33:40.565
- I sent him home.
- Oh, wonderful.

33:40.600 --> 33:43.365
He gets the day off,
and I get to wait by the phone.

33:43.400 --> 33:47.600
- It's because of him Junior escaped.
- Dad, can I go with you?

33:47.635 --> 33:50.000
- No.
- Can Janice go and we can stay here?

33:50.100 --> 33:51.865
What'd I tell you
about being impolite?

33:51.900 --> 33:55.300
If anyone cares, I'll be
upstairs lying down.

33:59.800 --> 34:02.800
One hour of television,
then you both finish your homework.

34:02.900 --> 34:05.600
And you, lay off
the Snapple.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.949
What galls me is that before
Little Carmine went to Florida,

34:13.985 --> 34:16.900
I was actually close with him.
I was in his wedding party.

34:16.935 --> 34:19.117
Organized his whole
fucking bachelor party...

34:19.152 --> 34:21.300
lesbian show, whores...
fucking disgusting.

34:21.400 --> 34:23.750
Then when they had that kid
with the lung problem,

34:23.784 --> 34:26.100
who you think got him that
doctor on Park Avenue?

34:26.135 --> 34:27.965
Water over
the dam, huh?

34:28.000 --> 34:29.900
I had no idea you guys
were that close.

34:30.000 --> 34:32.199
Close? We were
like brothers.

34:32.300 --> 34:35.000
It's a shame that you can't find
a way to work things out.

34:35.100 --> 34:37.600
Give me piece
of bread, huh?

34:38.900 --> 34:40.750
Have you thought
about this?

34:40.784 --> 34:42.565
Maybe you let him
keep Lorraine,

34:42.600 --> 34:45.400
and you take a bigger
piece of his Florida shit, the clubs.

34:45.435 --> 34:47.699
If I wanted to worry
about Florida,

34:47.800 --> 34:49.699
I would move
to fucking Miami.

34:49.800 --> 34:51.800
You know, it wasn't
long ago I remember

34:51.900 --> 34:53.500
you used to wait
in the car.

34:53.600 --> 34:56.199
And as far as I'm concerned
you should still be there!

34:56.300 --> 34:59.200
- He was just trying...
- Fuck "he was just!"

34:59.235 --> 35:01.500
Everybody's got
a goddamn opinion!

35:09.600 --> 35:11.700
I didn't say
nothing, Ton'.

35:13.100 --> 35:16.100
- What the fuck did I say?!
- I'm sorry, T, I just...

35:16.135 --> 35:18.317
Now I gotta un-fuck
what you just fucked up.

35:18.352 --> 35:20.500
Gotta do something nice for Johnny.
Like what?

35:20.600 --> 35:22.700
What the fuck
am I supposed to do?!

35:30.700 --> 35:34.400
You gotta understand, this shit between
Johnny and Little Carmine is bad.

35:34.435 --> 35:36.600
The instability.
But worse comes to worst,

35:36.635 --> 35:38.700
it could work
to our advantage.

35:38.800 --> 35:41.265
- How?
- They fight,

35:41.300 --> 35:43.900
we pick up any crumbs
from the fallout.

35:45.500 --> 35:48.600
The odds are that Johnny'll end up
on top, but who knows?

35:51.600 --> 35:54.000
So keep your ears open
and your mouth shut!

35:56.100 --> 35:58.300
Apparently, there's
a new president

35:58.400 --> 35:59.800
at the electrician's union.

35:59.900 --> 36:02.300
Tony sent Chrissy over
there to talk to him.

36:03.700 --> 36:06.200
Something I've always been
meaning to get straight...

36:06.235 --> 36:08.867
Tony calls Christopher
his nephew,

36:08.902 --> 36:11.500
yet sometimes
you refer to them

36:11.535 --> 36:13.765
as cousins.

36:13.800 --> 36:16.300
Yeah, right.
See, Chrissy's not Tony's nephew.

36:16.400 --> 36:18.100
Chrissy's Carmela's cousin.

36:18.200 --> 36:22.400
She was first cousin
to Dickie Moltisanti, Chrissy's dad.

36:22.435 --> 36:26.600
But he was always kinda like
a big brother to Tony, Dickie.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.200
So Tony calls
Chrissy his nephew.

36:31.300 --> 36:34.300
- It's an Italian thing.
- Okay.

36:34.400 --> 36:36.900
Although technically,
Tony and Chrissy are cousins.

36:36.935 --> 36:38.965
Joanne Blundetto,
Chrissy's mom,

36:39.000 --> 36:42.600
is Tony's cousin
on his mother's side?

36:42.700 --> 36:45.365
But, like way back.

36:45.400 --> 36:48.100
Like from the old country
or something.

36:50.100 --> 36:53.665
- Robyn?
- What?

36:53.700 --> 36:56.400
How much longer am I gonna
have to keep doing this?

36:58.100 --> 37:00.300
Major RICO against
Tony Soprano?

37:00.400 --> 37:02.665
Those things take
years to build.

37:02.700 --> 37:05.065
This recent case against
Joe Massino in New York?

37:05.100 --> 37:08.100
It was seven years before
indictments were handed down.

37:26.500 --> 37:28.500
Hello, handsome.

37:30.100 --> 37:33.200
Where you living now?
Around here?

37:33.235 --> 37:36.300
- Do you know me?
- Do I know you?

37:41.100 --> 37:44.100
Jupiter Club
on 6th Street?

37:45.200 --> 37:48.000
Caught fire,
that place.

37:48.100 --> 37:50.900
Lot of people died.

37:51.000 --> 37:53.400
Do you know
my brother, Johnny?

37:55.400 --> 37:58.100
You got all the looks,
I'll tell ya that.

37:58.135 --> 38:00.000
What are you saying?

38:00.100 --> 38:01.600
You and I
had relations?

38:07.900 --> 38:10.200
Son of a bitch
in a taxicab,

38:10.235 --> 38:12.500
run me right
over my foot.

38:15.600 --> 38:18.900
- I have a car.
- Want a date?

38:19.000 --> 38:21.565
I'll give you half and half
in the back seat.

38:21.600 --> 38:25.000
- I want to go home.
- Let me get a ride by the shelter.

38:25.035 --> 38:27.200
I have to find my car.

39:41.900 --> 39:44.400
How you doing?

39:44.500 --> 39:46.600
I don't gotta
tell you shit.

39:46.635 --> 39:49.165
See some ID, sir?

39:49.200 --> 39:51.300
Fuck you, copper,
I know my rights.

39:51.335 --> 39:53.265
Hey, take
it easy now.

39:53.300 --> 39:56.100
My car was stolen.
I want my lawyer.

39:56.135 --> 40:00.200
- What's his name?
- Mel.

40:00.235 --> 40:02.965
Okay, Mel what?

40:03.000 --> 40:05.500
I see you went out
and forgot your shoes.

40:05.535 --> 40:08.065
- Where do you live?
- Belleville.

40:08.100 --> 40:09.965
Sure you don't want
to tell me your name?

40:10.000 --> 40:13.500
- You're not in any trouble or anything.
- Corrado Soprano.

40:15.500 --> 40:17.500
Tell you what, sir,

40:17.600 --> 40:20.500
why don't you come and get in the car
where it's nice and warm?

40:20.600 --> 40:22.600
We'll try to figure out
how to get in touch

40:22.635 --> 40:24.300
with your lawyer,
all right?

40:46.800 --> 40:49.965
Jesus, Uncle Jun',
thank God.

40:50.000 --> 40:54.400
- This gentleman reside here, ma'am?
- He's my uncle.

40:54.500 --> 40:57.000
Where have you been?
We were worried sick.

40:57.100 --> 40:59.950
I'll need to see some
identification, ma'am.

40:59.985 --> 41:02.800
- Oh, okay, I'll get my bag.
- His, actually.

41:02.900 --> 41:04.800
Bobby, get
Uncle Jun's wallet.

41:04.835 --> 41:06.700
It's upstairs
on his dresser.

41:12.100 --> 41:14.100
Uncle Jun',
you're freezing.

41:14.200 --> 41:16.300
We found him walking across
Clay Street Bridge in Newark.

41:16.335 --> 41:18.365
Newark?

41:18.400 --> 41:20.500
- Where's your car?
- They stole it.

41:20.535 --> 41:23.700
- Who stole it?
- You know who.

41:33.400 --> 41:37.200
It's him.
Junior Soprano.

41:38.700 --> 41:41.600
- Here ya go, sir.
- Go shit in your hat.

41:41.635 --> 41:44.500
Uncle Jun', stop.
Thank you, officers.

41:44.535 --> 41:46.400
Thank you.

41:48.300 --> 41:50.065
Uncle Jun',
did you tell Tommy

41:50.100 --> 41:53.500
- you were going to see my father?
- Of course not.

41:56.100 --> 41:58.100
What are you doing?
Sit!

41:58.200 --> 42:00.600
- I have to use the facilities.
- Bobby, go with him.

42:00.635 --> 42:02.400
God damn it,
I can piss by myself!

42:02.500 --> 42:05.400
Okay, okay.

42:07.400 --> 42:10.500
- I'll open some soup.
- You go out for some exercise,

42:10.535 --> 42:12.700
people give you
the goddamn third degree.

42:16.200 --> 42:18.800
- Hi, Ellie.
- Oh, hello, Louie.

42:18.900 --> 42:20.765
How's the big
slot-machine king?

42:20.800 --> 42:23.700
Oh, I ain't doing that
no more, I'm retired.

42:23.735 --> 42:26.300
Tony, it's me.

42:34.000 --> 42:37.850
- What's the matter?
- It's Uncle Jun'.

42:37.885 --> 42:41.700
They found him in Newark,
in his slippers.

42:41.735 --> 42:44.165
He was looking
for Daddy, Tony.

42:44.200 --> 42:46.600
He may have Alzheimer's.
I don't know.

42:46.635 --> 42:49.000
Good, maybe he'll forget
my phone number.

42:49.100 --> 42:50.600
Jesus Christ.

42:52.900 --> 42:56.000
Mozzarella in carrozza.
Still warm.

42:56.100 --> 42:58.100
Artie, we're in the middle
of a family meeting.

42:58.200 --> 43:00.100
I'm not even here.

43:01.900 --> 43:05.700
He's our uncle, Tony. There may be
something seriously wrong with him.

43:05.735 --> 43:07.900
Listen, Janice,
like I told your husband,

43:08.000 --> 43:10.800
- he's fucking dead to me.
- Are you that fragile?

43:10.835 --> 43:13.517
You don't know the half
of it when it comes to us.

43:13.552 --> 43:16.165
And if you're so concerned,
take him to the doctor.

43:16.200 --> 43:19.100
- 'Cause I've had it.
- You're the only one he relates to.

43:19.200 --> 43:21.100
We won't even be able
to get him in the car.

43:21.135 --> 43:23.900
Fuck him.
You reap what you sow.

43:24.000 --> 43:27.200
You sure did.
You think maybe there's a reason

43:27.235 --> 43:30.400
you're living all alone
here without your family?

43:30.500 --> 43:33.450
Whoa.
Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute.

43:33.485 --> 43:36.400
You're gonna give me
advice on marriage?

43:36.500 --> 43:39.800
You know, Tony, there's a lot I can say
right now that I am not gonna say.

43:39.835 --> 43:42.265
Fuck it! Say it! Say it!
Who gives a fuck?

43:42.300 --> 43:44.500
Think I don't know what
you're doing here, Janice?

43:44.600 --> 43:46.565
Trying to pawn
this shit off on me.

43:46.600 --> 43:49.500
Your whole life... whenever
there's a family problem,

43:49.535 --> 43:52.317
- you shirk your duties or run away!
- Ran away?

43:52.352 --> 43:55.065
- Tibet or fucking Berkeley.
- I was 18 years old!

43:55.100 --> 43:57.700
I was 16 when you left me with our
head case of a mother.

43:57.735 --> 44:00.100
Who you all of a sudden
relate to so fucking well!

44:00.135 --> 44:01.465
I was merely saying...

44:01.500 --> 44:04.100
Free-spirit Janice,
rebel without a cause,

44:04.200 --> 44:06.165
while I sit here
mired in her bullshit

44:06.200 --> 44:09.000
trying to be a good son
while you're off dropping acid

44:09.035 --> 44:11.065
- and blowing roadies!
- Roadies?

44:11.100 --> 44:14.300
- Oh, you don't wanna know.
- That is not true, Tony.

44:14.400 --> 44:17.000
Now you tell him that
that's not true!

44:17.100 --> 44:19.100
Poor fucking Janice,
she's so depressed.

44:19.200 --> 44:21.300
Poor Janice, she can't get up
off the couch

44:21.335 --> 44:23.400
'cause she's so tired
from her Epstein-Barr.

44:23.500 --> 44:25.665
Poor fucking Janice.
Va fongul!

44:25.700 --> 44:28.200
- Why don't we calm down?
- Maybe you were the smart one

44:28.300 --> 44:30.965
'cause you got outta here,
but your hippie string ran out

44:31.000 --> 44:34.000
and now you're gonna do to this man
what you do to every one of 'em.

44:34.035 --> 44:37.000
- Fucking piece of shit!
- You stupid cunt.

44:37.100 --> 44:39.100
Oh, just like
your mother, huh?

44:39.200 --> 44:41.400
Now you can do to him
what she did to Daddy!

44:42.800 --> 44:44.800
Cocksucker!

44:51.800 --> 44:53.700
You want more
responsibility?

44:53.735 --> 44:55.600
Start with controlling
your wife.

45:07.700 --> 45:11.000
And then from nowhere,
he cracks one kid's head with a shovel

45:11.035 --> 45:12.865
and the other one,
he knocks out of a tree.

45:12.900 --> 45:15.700
He jumped out of the tree and came
at me with a chainsaw.

45:15.735 --> 45:17.500
I got a right
to defend myself, Ton'.

45:17.535 --> 45:19.767
All right,
take it easy, relax.

45:19.802 --> 45:21.965
Sal Vitro's been
working the area

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
since my ma was still
working at Kresge's.

45:24.100 --> 45:27.000
I should be able to help out a kid
from my own neighborhood.

45:28.100 --> 45:29.865
All right,
how about this?

45:29.900 --> 45:31.800
Vitro and your nephew
split the area...

45:31.835 --> 45:33.900
east of Dyer is yours,

45:34.000 --> 45:36.800
west of Dyer goes to him.
As for the broken arm...

45:36.900 --> 45:38.950
I don't know,
give him $500.

45:38.985 --> 45:41.000
I already told
the guy 12, T.

45:41.100 --> 45:45.100
Well there's fucking
compromises in life, Paulie.

45:47.500 --> 45:50.000
All right, make it a grand
for the pain and suffering.

45:50.035 --> 45:53.165
Naturally I want
my taste, retroactive,

45:53.200 --> 45:55.900
'cause this is the first time
I heard about any of this.

45:55.935 --> 45:59.800
It's a new venture.
My nephew's barely on his feet.

45:59.835 --> 46:02.117
I mean, I didn't
want to start kicking up

46:02.152 --> 46:04.400
and pull it back
if it don't work out.

46:06.800 --> 46:09.600
And of course Vitro'll
do your grass too, Ton'.

46:09.635 --> 46:11.765
No charge.

46:11.800 --> 46:14.200
Remind me to talk
to you about that later.

46:19.800 --> 46:22.065
There he is.
Salvatore, my boy.

46:22.100 --> 46:24.400
- How's that pitching arm?
- It's getting there.

46:24.435 --> 46:27.400
Paul, say hello
to Mr. Gaultieri.

46:27.500 --> 46:30.400
That's my middle
name, Paul.

46:34.200 --> 46:37.700
So I talked to that guy.
Good news.

46:37.735 --> 46:39.600
I got you 500
for your arm,

46:39.700 --> 46:41.900
and you keep
half your area.

46:42.000 --> 46:44.400
- Half?
- It could've been nothing.

46:44.435 --> 46:45.865
Lucky you know me.

46:45.900 --> 46:48.700
West of Dyer's yours,
east belongs to him.

46:48.800 --> 46:51.500
Paulie, my wife's
gonna sh...

46:52.500 --> 46:54.300
All right,
thank you, Paulie.

46:56.300 --> 46:58.265
Oh, one more thing.

46:58.300 --> 47:01.000
You're gonna have to cut a couple
of lawns on the comp.

47:01.100 --> 47:03.300
Some friends of ours.

47:15.300 --> 47:17.400
Some shot, huh,
the way it hooked?

47:17.500 --> 47:19.400
You got a fucking
horseshoe up your ass.

47:19.500 --> 47:22.200
Mr. Soprano?

47:26.100 --> 47:29.100
Harry Winer, I was
your mother's neurologist.

47:29.200 --> 47:32.300
- I did her work-up from Green Grove?
- Yeah, how you doing?

47:32.400 --> 47:35.300
So I assume your sister
told you I'm treating your uncle.

47:36.400 --> 47:38.500
Oh yeah, yeah,
she mentioned it.

47:38.600 --> 47:40.600
- Catch you in there, T.
- Yeah.

47:40.700 --> 47:44.400
I think with the right meds
we can control these things.

47:44.435 --> 47:46.817
- What things?
- The infarcts.

47:46.852 --> 47:49.165
They're akin
to mini-strokes.

47:49.200 --> 47:52.200
He suffered significant brain trauma
the other day. You probably noticed him

47:52.300 --> 47:54.665
acting differently over the past six
months, a year maybe.

47:54.700 --> 47:58.100
Well to tell you the truth, me and my
uncle, we don't talk much anymore.

47:58.135 --> 48:00.067
Oh, I'm sorry
to hear that.

48:00.102 --> 48:01.965
Don't be,
he's a hostile prick.

48:02.000 --> 48:05.500
Well, unfortunately obstinacy
is consistent with his condition.

48:05.535 --> 48:09.000
Impatience, forgetfulness,
particularly with short-term memory.

48:09.100 --> 48:12.000
Do you find he'll ask the same question
every three minutes?

48:12.035 --> 48:14.165
What time it is?

48:14.200 --> 48:16.700
I don't know.
Maybe.

48:18.400 --> 48:21.000
It's frustrating, I know.
Anyway, the last thing I wanted to do

48:21.035 --> 48:22.965
was get in the middle
of a family squabble.

48:23.000 --> 48:26.600
- I just wanted to say hello.
- Well, nice seeing you.

48:26.635 --> 48:28.500
Okay.
All right.

49:03.500 --> 49:05.700
Member of the squirrel
family,

49:05.800 --> 49:08.700
the prairie dog makes
its home mainly...

49:08.800 --> 49:10.600
Tommy?

49:14.500 --> 49:17.800
Brought you some fish.
Trying to clean out my refrigerator.

49:17.900 --> 49:21.200
Make sure you form a seal
when you shut that freezer door.

49:26.200 --> 49:30.600
Of the two main species,
the black-tailed prairie dog

49:30.635 --> 49:33.317
is much more widespread,
inhabiting much

49:33.352 --> 49:36.000
of the Great Plains
and the Great Basin.

49:49.200 --> 49:51.300
So how you feeling?

49:51.400 --> 49:53.800
Heard you had
a little problem.

49:53.900 --> 49:56.200
What problem?

49:57.700 --> 49:59.600
All right.

50:01.100 --> 50:03.500
But your doctor said
something different.

50:03.600 --> 50:05.800
Who, Kennedy?

50:05.900 --> 50:08.700
Kennedy's
your cancer doctor.

50:08.735 --> 50:10.700
I knew that.

50:10.800 --> 50:12.900
You said doctor.

50:14.600 --> 50:18.000
The white-tailed prairie dog
lives at higher elevations,

50:18.100 --> 50:20.500
hibernating
throughout the winter.

50:20.535 --> 50:22.900
Just take your medicine,
Uncle Jun'.

50:23.900 --> 50:25.900
Make you feel better.

50:26.000 --> 50:29.300
Help with your memory.

50:31.200 --> 50:34.100
Believe me, there's plenty
I'd like to forget.

50:34.200 --> 50:36.400
Yeah, you and me both.

50:45.300 --> 50:49.100
- Feech was here?
- Yeah, he came to pay his respects.

50:51.300 --> 50:54.700
What's this I hear,
you ruled against Feech?

50:54.800 --> 50:57.900
- He's an important man.
- Why is he bitching at you about shit?

50:57.935 --> 51:00.200
I'm still the boss
of this family,

51:00.300 --> 51:02.300
despite any arrangements.

51:07.800 --> 51:10.500
Yellow in color,
they often have dark...

51:10.600 --> 51:13.300
These prairie dogs,
they'll sleep during the day.

51:13.400 --> 51:15.300
Oh yeah?

51:19.300 --> 51:22.065
Look, the doctor
said you

51:22.100 --> 51:25.100
might not have known
what you were saying.

51:25.135 --> 51:27.100
What are you
talking about?

51:27.135 --> 51:29.600
The varsity shit.

51:41.300 --> 51:44.450
So, what else did Feech
have to say?

51:44.485 --> 51:47.600
Getting a new top
on his convertible.

51:50.700 --> 51:54.200
All right, let's assume that you
didn't know what you were saying.

51:55.500 --> 51:57.800
That you forget
you say shit over and over.

51:57.835 --> 51:59.700
Yeah?

52:00.800 --> 52:03.650
Why's it gotta be
something mean?

52:03.685 --> 52:06.500
Why can't you repeat
something good?

52:12.800 --> 52:15.500
There's the coyote.

52:20.500 --> 52:22.900
I mean,
don't you love me?
