[Applause, Cheering]

36:22.180 --> 36:27.393
I would like to just go into
the recording studio and lay
some of those tracks down.

36:27.477 --> 36:32.606
And of course I would love to
play some bigger venues—
Wembley Stadium, Red Rocks.

36:32.691 --> 36:34.942
- [Gasps]
- Hey, guys.

36:35.026 --> 36:39.071
I'm Josh Groban.
This is my bodyguard, Flex.

36:39.155 --> 36:42.825
We were in town. I was inducting
Run-D.M.C. into the Rock and
Roll Hall of Fame last night,

36:42.909 --> 36:45.160
so I thought I'd stop by
and say hello.

36:45.245 --> 36:49.999
- So which one of you
is, uh, Sandy?
- Ooh! [Laughs]

36:50.083 --> 36:53.502
Mr. Groban,
we are so honored
that you came here today.

36:53.628 --> 36:56.338
I came here
to tell you—
Yes, sir.

36:56.423 --> 36:58.674
Stop e-mailing me.

36:58.758 --> 37:02.636
This is a restraining order.
Stop sending me nude photos.
Stop calling me!

37:02.762 --> 37:06.140
I don't know how you got
my number, how you got my number
again after I changed it,

37:06.224 --> 37:09.727
but I don't want any more
of your edible gift baskets
or locks of your hair.

37:09.811 --> 37:12.521
And I don't wanna read
any more of those sonnets
you wrote for me.

37:12.606 --> 37:15.608
- That stuff got crazy, dude.
- [Groban]
Are we clear?

37:15.692 --> 37:18.027
- Mmm.
- Thank you, gentlemen.

37:18.111 --> 37:21.196
And, by the way,
great show.

37:21.281 --> 37:24.825
I mean, like—
[Imitates Explosion]
explosive.

37:24.910 --> 37:27.369
Thanks. Sorry.

37:40.634 --> 37:42.927
[Terri]
I'm sorry, Will.

37:43.011 --> 37:45.137
I— I could have been
more supportive.

37:48.183 --> 37:49.892
You guys are actually
pretty good.

37:51.853 --> 37:53.520
Honey, you were good.

37:55.106 --> 37:56.857
You were really good.

37:56.983 --> 38:00.527
Yeah?
Yeah.

38:03.698 --> 38:06.575
[Chuckles]

38:06.660 --> 38:09.286
[Whispers]
Come here.

38:09.371 --> 38:11.080
Don't bother.
She's already pregnant.

38:11.206 --> 38:14.124
[Both Laughing]
Hey, kids.
Have you seen Doodle?

38:14.209 --> 38:19.380
Now, you might be thinking,
why would a pop star like me
come over here and talk to you?

38:19.464 --> 38:24.176
But let me tell you something.
Throngs of screaming teenagers
don't do it for Josh Groban.

38:24.260 --> 38:26.887
No. Josh Groban
loves a blowsy alcoholic.

38:27.013 --> 38:28.639
[Burps]
Oh. Wow.

38:28.723 --> 38:31.266
You'll have to forgive me.
I'm a little bit drunk,

38:31.351 --> 38:34.061
and I'm afraid I'm not
making good choices right now.

38:35.271 --> 38:37.481
Maybe she slipped
and hit her head again.

38:40.652 --> 38:43.988
You guys kicked
some serious tail
up there tonight.

38:44.114 --> 38:47.282
Sorry about
the whole Josh Groban thing.
No, that's all right.

38:47.367 --> 38:49.034
How are the other guys
takin' it?

38:49.119 --> 38:51.537
That Ryerson guy
cried himself to sleep
in Figgins's arms,

38:51.621 --> 38:54.581
and Ken Tanaka
is raiding the nacho bar.

38:56.167 --> 38:58.919
What about you?
You okay?

38:59.004 --> 39:03.090
You know what, Dad?
I am.

39:03.174 --> 39:05.509
I mean, this was all
a dream come true, but...

39:07.053 --> 39:10.264
I'm a teacher,
and a really good one.

39:11.433 --> 39:13.851
That's enough for me.
I know.

39:13.935 --> 39:15.811
I saw the way
your students look at you.

39:17.230 --> 39:18.897
You inspire people.

39:20.442 --> 39:23.777
Inspired me.
What do you mean?

39:23.862 --> 39:25.571
I'm going to law school.

39:25.655 --> 39:30.534
Night classes for now,
until I get
all of my prerequisites.

39:30.618 --> 39:32.244
But I registered yesterday.

39:32.328 --> 39:36.331
You made me realize it's never
too late to grow a pair
and go after your dream.

39:36.416 --> 39:39.626
That's amazing.
That's so amazing.

39:44.758 --> 39:47.384
Hey, Kurt.

39:47.469 --> 39:52.890
I just wanted to say,
I'm really sorry
I did that to your car.

39:52.974 --> 39:54.641
I'll pay for it
to get fixed.

39:54.726 --> 39:57.561
It's okay.
My dad took my baby away...

39:57.645 --> 40:00.939
after he found
my tiara collection
in my hope chest.

40:01.024 --> 40:04.693
And I just wanted to say,
I hope it works out
between you and Rachel-

40:04.778 --> 40:08.864
you'll have really cute,
loud babies.

40:11.785 --> 40:13.702
Mercedes.

40:16.498 --> 40:18.791
I lied to you.

40:18.875 --> 40:22.753
I-I don't like Rachel.
[Footsteps]

40:25.715 --> 40:27.382
I'm gay.

40:29.010 --> 40:30.636
Why didn't you
just tell me?

40:30.720 --> 40:33.972
Because I've
never told anyone before.

40:35.100 --> 40:37.267
You shouldn't be ashamed
of who you are, Kurt.

40:37.352 --> 40:42.773
You should just tell people,
especially the kids in Glee.

40:42.857 --> 40:47.945
The whole point of the club
is about expressing what's
really inside you.

40:48.029 --> 40:49.863
Remember?

40:49.948 --> 40:54.910
I can't. I'm just
not that confident,
I guess.

41:02.418 --> 41:05.129
Let me get this straight.

41:05.213 --> 41:07.631
The Glee Club
got rid of Dakota Stanley,

41:07.715 --> 41:09.633
Mr. Schuester's back,

41:09.717 --> 41:13.262
and they're busy at work
on a new number,
more confident than ever.

41:13.346 --> 41:16.598
And down, clap,
and up, clap, clap.

41:16.683 --> 41:19.351
Down, clap,
and up, clap, clap.

41:19.435 --> 41:21.645
This is what we call
a total disaster, ladies.

41:21.729 --> 41:24.064
I'm going to ask you
to smell your armpits.

41:27.402 --> 41:29.778
- [Sniffing]
- That's the smell of failure,

41:29.863 --> 41:32.072
and it's stinking up
my office.

41:35.702 --> 41:39.204
I'm revoking
your tanning privileges
for the rest of the semester.

41:39.289 --> 41:41.248
[Sobbing]
No!

41:42.709 --> 41:44.710
No!

41:47.755 --> 41:51.550
- Miss Sylvester,
I wanna thank you.
- For what?

41:51.634 --> 41:55.137
For teaching me
a valuable life lesson.

41:55.221 --> 41:57.514
When you really
believe in yourself,

41:57.599 --> 41:59.516
you don't have to bring
other people down.

42:05.940 --> 42:08.942
Uh, uh, step-ball-change
and head.

42:09.027 --> 42:12.571
Step-ball-change and head.
Low and high.

42:12.655 --> 42:15.282
Low and high.

42:15.366 --> 42:18.285
- Uh. What do you guys think?
- Mr. Schuester?

42:18.369 --> 42:20.787
Yes, Rachel?

42:22.123 --> 42:25.000
It was really good.
[Laughing]

42:26.836 --> 42:28.837
[Will]
Thank you. Thank you.

42:28.922 --> 42:31.131
