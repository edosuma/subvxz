06:51.945 --> 06:55.015

07:05.526 --> 07:08.195
CONGRATULATIONS.

07:08.295 --> 07:10.230
YOU GOT THE CLANKS.

07:10.330 --> 07:12.232
IT ISN'T "THE CLANKS."

07:12.332 --> 07:15.869
IT'S JUST THAT I'M
OVERTIRED, THAT'S ALL.

07:15.969 --> 07:18.171
ALRIGHT SORRY,
IT'S JUST BEEN A WHILE

07:18.271 --> 07:20.474

07:34.021 --> 07:36.990
I'M ALL EARS.

07:37.090 --> 07:42.195
YOU DON'T KNOW HALF
AS MUCH AS YOU PRETEND TO.

07:45.265 --> 07:48.602
YOU HAVE AN INFALLIBLE,

07:48.702 --> 07:52.339
IF TIRESOME, GIFT FOR
STATING THE OBVIOUS.

07:52.439 --> 07:53.941
HOWEVER...

07:54.041 --> 07:59.913
HALF IS EVER SO MUCH BETTER
THAN NOTHING AT ALL.

08:01.448 --> 08:03.150
THERE YOU ARE.

08:03.250 --> 08:05.919
JONESY'S TEARING MAD ABOUT

08:43.757 --> 08:45.358
YOU MESS WITH
THAT BOY AGAIN,

08:45.458 --> 08:48.629
AND I WILL TEAR YOUR PECKER OFF
LIKE A PIECE OF FRENCH BREAD.

08:48.729 --> 08:53.100
( chuckling )

09:00.440 --> 09:01.675
FINE !

09:01.775 --> 09:03.176

YEAH, WELL, NICE "FELLAS"
DON'T COME TO PLACES LIKE THIS

09:07.014 --> 09:09.282
LOOKING FOR GIRLS
TO MARRY, MOTHER.

09:10.183 --> 09:12.519
YOU KNOW WHAT ?

09:12.620 --> 09:13.854
I LIKED IT.

09:13.954 --> 09:15.555
I LIKED THE WAY
HE HELD ME.

09:15.656 --> 09:16.957
I LIKED THE WAY
HE LOOKED AT ME.

09:17.057 --> 09:18.491
AND YOU'RE WRONG.

09:18.592 --> 09:20.327
HE WAS MINE.

09:20.427 --> 09:22.730
HE GAVE HIMSELF
TO ME.

09:22.830 --> 09:27.200
AND HE DIDN'T
KNOCK ME UP.

09:30.771 --> 09:34.274
BECAUSE THAT ONLY
HAPPENS IN DIME NOVELS.

09:43.216 --> 09:47.054
ONE-TWO-THREE, SMILE,
FIVE-SIX-SEVEN-EIGHT.

09:47.154 --> 09:51.625
ONE-TWO-THREE-FOUR,
FIVE-SIX-SEVEN-EIGHT.

09:51.725 --> 09:55.829
ONE-TWO-THREE-FOUR,
FIVE-SIX-SEVEN-EIGHT.

09:55.929 --> 09:59.900
ONE-TWO-THREE-FOUR,
FIVE-SIX-SEVEN-EIGHT.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.802
NO, DORA, IT'S CROSS
TOUCH WITH STEP TOUCH.

10:01.902 --> 10:03.937
DORA MAE, YOU'RE
ON THE WRONG FOOT.

10:04.037 --> 10:05.773
SHE'S MESSING
IT ALL UP, MAMA.

10:05.873 --> 10:07.941
JEEZ, ALL THEY GONNA
WANT TO SEE IS MY TITTIES.

10:08.041 --> 10:09.743
THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT
NO FANCY DANCE STEPS.

10:09.843 --> 10:11.511
WELL, I CARE,
I'M A DANCER.

10:11.611 --> 10:12.713
YOU SEE THAT ?

10:12.813 --> 10:14.014
WHY CAN'T YOU BE
MORE LIKE YOUR SISTER ?

10:14.114 --> 10:15.548
SHOW A LITTLE PRIDE.

10:15.649 --> 10:18.618
FELIX, NOW HOW'D THAT GET
ALL TORE UP LIKE THAT ?

10:18.719 --> 10:21.188
I DON'T KNOW.

10:21.288 --> 10:24.224
THAT BRA
DON'T FIT YOU.

10:34.802 --> 10:37.304
EVERYONE THINKS
SHE'S THE NICE ONE.

10:44.712 --> 10:46.714
GOT ANOTHER ?

11:03.864 --> 11:05.999
HOW'S A PERSON KNOW
IF SHE'S PREGNANT ?

11:06.099 --> 11:11.171
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU
DID THAT TYPE OF THING.

11:16.143 --> 11:17.610
OKAY.

11:17.711 --> 11:19.379
DID THE GUY
WEAR ANYTHING ?

11:19.479 --> 11:21.348
HE KEPT HIS SOCKS ON.

11:21.448 --> 11:24.651
I'M TALKING
ABOUT A SKIN.

11:24.752 --> 11:27.654
A RUBBER
ON HIS PRIVATES.

11:27.755 --> 11:29.189
OH, NO.

11:29.289 --> 11:31.558
I DON'T KNOW.

11:31.658 --> 11:33.761
I DON'T THINK SO.

11:33.861 --> 11:35.395
WELL, YOU PROBABLY
AIN'T PREGNANT.

11:35.495 --> 11:38.265
CAN'T GET PREGNANT
YOUR FIRST TIME.

11:42.635 --> 11:44.104
HOW'D YOU KNOW ?

11:44.204 --> 11:47.741
NEXT TIME, JUST MAKE SURE
HE'S SPORTIN' RUBBER.

11:59.219 --> 12:03.824
ONE OF MY TITTIES IS A WHOLE
LOT BIGGER THAN THE OTHER.

12:05.592 --> 12:07.460
OH.

12:07.560 --> 12:10.931
YEAH, I HADN'T NOTICED.

12:11.031 --> 12:13.533
LOTS OF FELLAS
LIKE IT.

12:13.633 --> 12:18.038
PAY EXTRA
FOR IT, EVEN.

12:19.907 --> 12:22.375
STARTED DANCIN'
WHEN I WAS 13.

12:22.475 --> 12:24.344
NOT MUCH
TO LOOK AT THEN.

12:24.444 --> 12:26.980
NOT 'TIL
I GOT MY TITTIES.

12:27.080 --> 12:30.183
MAMA SAYS
THEY'RE A GIFT.

12:30.283 --> 12:32.319
DRAW A REAL CROWD.

12:32.419 --> 12:33.720
YOU LIKE THAT ?

12:33.821 --> 12:37.024
ALL THOSE GUYS

12:37.124 --> 12:40.127
HOLLERIN' AND
GRABBIN' AT YA ?

12:40.227 --> 12:44.064
DON'T MAKE
NO DIFFERENCE TO ME.

12:52.840 --> 12:54.774
MISSED A SPOT.

12:54.875 --> 13:01.048
I BET YOU'RE
A REAL GOOD KISSER.

13:12.792 --> 13:16.129
YOU BOYS ARE
WORKING FAST.

13:16.229 --> 13:18.165
YOU GOT THAT TEN-IN-ONE UP
IN NO TIME.

13:18.265 --> 13:21.902
HEY, IT'S A GOOD THING
THAT BLOW DOWN

13:22.002 --> 13:25.038
DIDN'T DO TOO MUCH DAMAGE
TO THE BIG TOP, HUH ?

13:27.207 --> 13:29.542
DON'T GOT MUCH TO SAY,
DO YA, JONESY ?

13:29.642 --> 13:32.612
FELLAS AIN'T HAPPY, SAMSON,
AND NEITHER IS THE TROUPE.

13:32.712 --> 13:34.481
IT'S TRAVELLING DAY BLUES.

13:34.581 --> 13:36.316
THEY'LL SHAKE IT OFF.

13:36.416 --> 13:37.317
DON'T THINK SO.

13:37.417 --> 13:38.818
YOU GOT A BUNCH OF
ROUSTIES BACK THERE

13:38.919 --> 13:40.287
HAVEN'T BEEN PAID
SQUAT SINCE MILFAY.

13:40.387 --> 13:41.621
A STRING OF BAD LUCK.

13:41.721 --> 13:43.090
JESUS.

13:43.190 --> 13:45.425
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,
LET'S GO INTO TOWN TONIGHT.

13:45.525 --> 13:48.061
BLOW OFF

13:49.296 --> 13:53.266
IT'S ON ME,
TELL THE BOYS.

13:57.637 --> 13:59.206

13:59.306 --> 14:01.741
( Dora Mae )
WHOO, GONNA TEAR DOWN
THE HOUSE TONIGHT.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.911
HAVEN'T BEEN OUT
ON THE TOWN IN A DOGS AGE.

14:04.011 --> 14:05.712
YOU CALL THIS
A TOWN ?

14:05.812 --> 14:07.514
LOOK AT THIS PLACE.

14:07.614 --> 14:10.283
COME ON.

14:17.390 --> 14:19.459
WELL, WHAT HAVE
WE GOT HERE ?

14:19.559 --> 14:21.995
THIS PLACE IS A DUMP.

14:22.095 --> 14:25.198
YOU HAVE GOT
TO BE KIDDING ME.

14:25.298 --> 14:26.733
I THOUGHT YOU SAID THERE
WAS GONNA BE REAL MUSIC.

14:26.833 --> 14:27.935
THERE'S A PIANO.

14:28.035 --> 14:29.369
HAVE AT IT.

14:29.469 --> 14:30.971
FORGET IT, I'M JUST
GONNA GET BLOTTO.

14:31.071 --> 14:34.574
HMPH, THE MAID DIDN'T
COME THIS WEEK I SEE.

14:34.674 --> 14:38.345
COME HERE.

14:39.980 --> 14:44.584
LOOKS LIKE YOU NEVER
MADE IT OUT OF TOWN, EH ?

14:44.684 --> 14:46.419
NEVER DO.

14:46.519 --> 14:49.656
WHAT'LL IT BE ?

14:49.756 --> 14:51.091
WHISKEY.

14:51.191 --> 14:54.261
TWO GLASSES AND
A BOTTLE OF YOUR BEST.

15:04.171 --> 15:06.006
JEEZ LOUISE,
FRIDAY NIGHT.

15:06.106 --> 15:07.840
YOU'D THINK THEY'D
BE SHOWIN' SOMETHING.

15:07.941 --> 15:10.510
OR MAYBE WE'RE EARLY.

15:16.183 --> 15:18.385
I HAVEN'T BEEN
TO THE MOVIES
SINCE FOREVER.

15:18.485 --> 15:20.720
DON'T LOOK LIKE NO ONE'S SEEN
ANYTHING HERE IN A DOG'S AGE.

15:20.820 --> 15:23.957
CAN'T HAVE BEEN
THAT LONG.

15:30.497 --> 15:32.732
YOU THINK WE SHOULD ?

15:32.832 --> 15:34.634
Y'ALL WANT SOME CANDY ?

15:34.734 --> 15:37.104
GOODNESS, NO.

18:56.068 --> 18:58.671
THEY DON'T DRINK MUCH.

18:58.771 --> 19:02.041

THEY DON'T COME IN.

19:02.141 --> 19:06.313

23:37.550 --> 23:39.819
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T STAY
COOPED UP INSIDE ALL DAY, MA.

23:39.919 --> 23:42.555

A FLOPHOUSE IN THERE.

23:42.655 --> 23:45.592
YOU COMING

23:45.692 --> 23:46.693

24:01.107 --> 24:03.543

"DOLLFUSS WAS SHOT IN HIS OFFICE
AND BLED TO DEATH ON THE FLOOR

24:18.457 --> 24:20.192

RECEIVING MEDICAL CARE..."

24:20.292 --> 24:21.661
WHY DON'T YOU PICK SOMETHING
OUT OF THE CATALOG YOU LIKE ?

24:21.761 --> 24:23.229
I'M JUST ASKING FOR
A LITTLE CONSIDERATION.

24:23.329 --> 24:25.431
I WAS MISS CANYON CITY,

24:49.455 --> 24:51.558
COME, LILA, MY DEAR.

24:51.658 --> 24:54.961

25:19.786 --> 25:21.854
SO I AIN'T TAKING OFF
MY PANTS TONIGHT.

25:21.954 --> 25:24.456
THE BLOW OFF IS
ALL YOURS, BABY SISTER.

25:24.557 --> 25:26.859
FINE, I DON'T CARE.

25:26.959 --> 25:29.862
I GET BETTER TIPS
THAN YOU DO, ANYWAY.

25:29.962 --> 25:32.298
LIKE HELL.

25:34.934 --> 25:38.037
YOU DON'T STRIP WHEN
YOU GOT YOUR FRIEND ?

25:38.137 --> 25:41.974
COULD YOU SEE ME OUT THERE
IN A PAD AND A BELT ?

25:51.584 --> 25:53.152

26:27.519 --> 26:29.155
I KNOW.

26:29.255 --> 26:34.526
AND I'D LIKE NOTHING BETTER
THAN TO SATISFY YOUR NEEDS,

26:34.627 --> 26:38.330
CONSIDERABLE AS
THEY MAY BE, BUT...

26:38.430 --> 26:41.167
BUT... ?

26:41.267 --> 26:43.235
DUTY CALLS.

26:43.335 --> 26:45.237
WHAT DUTY ?

26:45.337 --> 26:48.007
( laughing )

26:48.107 --> 26:52.311
MY LITTLE...

27:04.356 --> 27:09.028
WOULD YOU MIND TERRIBLY
LENDING ME SOMETHING ?

27:09.128 --> 27:10.496
ANYTHING.

27:10.596 --> 27:13.199

36:24.416 --> 36:26.518
THAT'S THE LAST
WE SAW OF HIM.

36:26.618 --> 36:28.987
WHY ?

36:29.087 --> 36:32.758
JUST A QUESTION.

36:37.696 --> 36:39.865
WHO'S SCUDDER ?

36:42.000 --> 36:46.738
WELL, AIN'T YOU JUST

39:15.521 --> 39:16.722
BUT SAMSON SAYS--

39:16.822 --> 39:18.223
I DON'T CARE
WHAT SAMSON SAYS.

39:18.323 --> 39:19.725
WE WORKED WAY TOUGHER
CROWDS THAN THIS.

39:19.825 --> 39:22.360
AND THESE ALVINS WOULD
SELL THEIR MOTHER

39:22.461 --> 39:24.162

40:02.100 --> 40:04.536
( crowd groaning )

40:04.636 --> 40:07.405
IN APPRECIATION
OF HER TALENT.

40:07.506 --> 40:09.541
THIS DANCE, GENTLEMEN,

40:09.641 --> 40:12.844
IS A DANCE YOU WILL
TAKE TO YOUR GRAVE.

40:12.944 --> 40:18.717
