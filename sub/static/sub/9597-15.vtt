WEBVTT

00:05.790 --> 00:08.157
Did you fix the sink?

00:08.192 --> 00:10.931
I told you I'd get to it.

00:10.965 --> 00:13.310
- Your hair looks nice.
- Thanks.

00:13.378 --> 00:17.530
- You cut it. Hmm?
- Yeah.

00:20.165 --> 00:21.132
I know.

00:21.166 --> 00:25.004
- Know what?
- I had lunch with her.

00:26.303 --> 00:29.704
You know, we had a couple
drinks ... really bonded.

00:31.941 --> 00:34.043
- Hmm.
- What are you gonna do?

00:34.077 --> 00:36.750
What we always said we'd
do if this ever happened.

00:39.820 --> 00:40.904
No! No, no, no! Please!

00:40.905 --> 00:44.093
Please! Please, don't!
Don't!

00:44.127 --> 00:47.063
Okay. Very nice.

00:47.097 --> 00:49.768
Jennifer, play with him first.
Enjoy it.

00:49.802 --> 00:52.105
Ryan, you don't believe
she'd pull that trigger, okay?

00:52.139 --> 00:55.541
Let's try it again.
No prop gun this time.

00:55.608 --> 00:57.175
Ryan, come on, get up.

00:57.209 --> 00:59.210
Okay, you're... great at dying,

00:59.244 --> 01:01.246
but you got to do it...
again.

01:01.780 --> 01:05.150
Ryan?
Ryan, come on.

01:08.523 --> 01:11.091
- What's going on?
- What?

01:14.129 --> 01:16.666
"Cauda equina" means "horse tail."

01:16.700 --> 01:19.836
- Cauda equina syndrome ...
- Gets its name because all this junk

01:19.870 --> 01:21.671
hangs out of your
spine like a horse tail.

01:21.705 --> 01:22.839
Okay, could you stop playing with this?

01:22.873 --> 01:25.975
Okay ...
what the hell are you wearing?

01:26.010 --> 01:30.445
Alfresco lunch-tray pants.
They came today.

01:30.479 --> 01:33.147
"Alfresco" means
"dining in the open air."

01:33.682 --> 01:35.249
Look.

01:36.585 --> 01:37.985
Something's going on.

01:38.020 --> 01:41.523
Uh-huh.
UPS boxes.

01:41.557 --> 01:43.726
There's your tell, Maura.
What happened?

01:43.760 --> 01:46.529
Okay, let's just get back to Casey.

01:48.098 --> 01:50.566
Shrapnel from an I.E.D.
transected his spinal cord

01:50.601 --> 01:52.135
and is still embedded in there.

01:52.169 --> 01:54.204
Only a cowboy surgeon
would attempt to remove it.

01:54.238 --> 01:55.573
It's hope, isn't it?

01:55.607 --> 01:57.074
How did you know?

01:57.108 --> 02:00.310
Yes.
She e-mailed me.

02:00.345 --> 02:02.847
She wants your kidney ...
for Cailin.

02:02.881 --> 02:06.951
- I haven't responded.
- You don't owe her anything, okay?

02:06.986 --> 02:09.988
It is not your fault that
she's your biological mother

02:10.021 --> 02:13.324
just as much as it's not her fault
that you're her biological daughter.

02:14.327 --> 02:16.128
And that didn't sound right.

02:16.162 --> 02:19.532
You should say,
"I like both my kidneys."

02:19.566 --> 02:21.400
And, "have a nice life."

02:21.435 --> 02:22.936
Hey.

02:22.970 --> 02:24.437
What are you doing out in the rain?

02:24.472 --> 02:27.941
Oh, I couldn't get him to
sleep, so I took him for a walk.

02:27.975 --> 02:31.411
- Aww.
- Ew.

02:31.445 --> 02:33.880
- You do that in the kitchen?
- No, of course not.

02:33.914 --> 02:37.216
Yes. She was just about to put
the head in the garbage disposal.

02:37.250 --> 02:40.886
Wait a minute.
You're messing with me, aren't you?

02:40.921 --> 02:43.556
- No.
- Yeah. Your auntie Jane is a kidder.

02:44.859 --> 02:47.460
What are you doing in the
rain with my grandson?!

02:47.495 --> 02:49.530
Babysitting.

02:49.564 --> 02:51.932
I think when you're the father,
they call it "parenting."

02:51.966 --> 02:54.234
He's fine.
He likes the fresh air.

02:54.269 --> 02:57.205
Oh, come here, sweetheart.

02:57.239 --> 03:01.075
Your daddy loved to play out in
the rain when he was a little boy.

03:01.110 --> 03:02.377
Yes.

03:02.411 --> 03:04.813
- How's Lydia?
- She's good.

03:04.847 --> 03:06.715
I think she's gonna get
a promotion at the Penny saver.

03:06.749 --> 03:08.250
Good.

03:08.284 --> 03:11.153
Aw, no!
I wanted to go to bed early.

03:12.255 --> 03:14.190
Was it a murder?

03:14.191 --> 03:15.657
- Rizzoli.
Dr. Isles.

03:15.692 --> 03:19.261
That's so cool.
Man, she's so lucky.

03:39.888 --> 03:42.690
3x15 - No More Drama in My Life

03:46.024 --> 03:48.960
Looks like an
accident with a prop gun.

03:48.994 --> 03:52.363
- Who pulled the trigger?
- His costar.

03:52.398 --> 03:55.066
Is that Roger DeLuth?
That's my councilman.

03:55.101 --> 03:58.437
Yeah, his wife was directing
a community-theater play here.

03:58.471 --> 04:00.606
He got her the space
because he's apparently pals

04:00.640 --> 04:02.575
with the developer
of the Storrow center.

04:02.609 --> 04:04.677
The potholes on my
street are out of control.

04:04.711 --> 04:06.345
Maybe I'll just mention it to him.

04:06.380 --> 04:09.315
Or maybe we'll just go
look at the body first.

04:13.153 --> 04:17.223
 Hey. I couldn't talk to the
woman who pulled the trigger ...

04:17.257 --> 04:20.159
Jennifer Johnson, 29.
EMTs are taking her to Boston General.

04:20.194 --> 04:22.995
- She's being treated for shock.
- Yeah, I'd be shock, too,

04:23.030 --> 04:25.231
if I fired a pretend
gun and killed my costar.

04:25.266 --> 04:26.800
Who was in charge of the prop gun?

04:26.835 --> 04:29.970
Victim. He was the star, lighting
designer, and prop master.

04:30.005 --> 04:33.541
Well, it's community theater...
they're all volunteers.

04:33.575 --> 04:37.010
That's odd.
Look at these entrance wounds.

04:37.045 --> 04:38.579
"Wounds" plural?
That's bizarre.

04:38.613 --> 04:40.347
It kind of looks like a cheese grater.

04:40.382 --> 04:43.717
Maybe he forgot to clean the prop gun...

04:43.751 --> 04:46.820
or left cotton wadding in it?
It hardly seems enough to kill him, though.

04:46.855 --> 04:49.990
I need to dissect this heart
to know what caused this injury.

04:50.024 --> 04:50.891
Did you check the other blanks?

04:50.892 --> 04:52.192
I was about to.
That's his prop cart over there.

04:52.226 --> 04:54.161
His real job was
maintaining this building

04:54.195 --> 04:55.730
and the rest of Storrow center.

04:55.764 --> 04:57.999
I'm having his truck towed
to the evidence garage.

04:58.033 --> 05:00.001
Anybody else have
access to the tool box?

05:00.035 --> 05:01.336
- I'll check.
- Yeah.

05:01.370 --> 05:04.906
It looks like a tragic
accident, but I'd rather be sure.

05:12.246 --> 05:13.613
I wish it was still raining.

05:13.648 --> 05:15.982
The sound is so peaceful.

05:16.017 --> 05:19.319
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

05:19.353 --> 05:23.389
Then why do I hear the sound
of computer keys clicking?

05:24.892 --> 05:30.630
- You're accessing DMV records?
- Ohh, he has a special license.

05:30.664 --> 05:33.066
Didn't you just hear me?
You shouldn't be doing this.

05:33.100 --> 05:34.301
This is an abuse of power.

05:34.335 --> 05:36.369
Well, that's why I'm
using your computer.

05:36.403 --> 05:38.204
I'm not abusing my power ...
you are.

05:38.238 --> 05:42.975
Well, since I'm the one who's exposed,
you're gonna go knock on his door

05:43.009 --> 05:46.946
and talk him out of the ridiculous
surgery that he's about to have.

05:46.980 --> 05:51.250
I have left messages, I've e-mailed,
and he doesn't respond.

05:51.284 --> 05:54.386
So, you know...
maybe it's not meant to be.

05:57.024 --> 06:01.393
- Well, that's odd.
- What?

06:01.428 --> 06:04.163
What are those, B.B.S?

06:04.197 --> 06:09.068
Larger... denser ...
possibly ball bearings.

06:09.103 --> 06:12.005
Either way, Mr. Fix-it
wouldn't load steel balls

06:12.006 --> 06:14.907
into his prop gun, unless
he was committing suicide.

06:21.148 --> 06:24.750
I'm not seeing any signs of tampering
on any of these other blanks.

06:24.785 --> 06:28.755
Mm, me, either.
So, he either killed himself

06:28.789 --> 06:31.124
or someone filled
a cartridge with ball bearings

06:31.158 --> 06:33.192
and then loaded it into
Ryan's prop gun.

06:33.227 --> 06:35.728
The director of the play said
he kept the gun in his tool box.

06:35.763 --> 06:37.163
Where'd he keep his tool box?

06:37.197 --> 06:38.698
Apparently, all over the place.

06:38.732 --> 06:40.633
Storrow center has
three separate buildings.

06:40.667 --> 06:42.267
Anybody could have had access to it.

06:42.302 --> 06:45.604
Irregularities of no specific form.

06:45.638 --> 06:48.707
- What?
- Seven are perfect spheres.

06:48.741 --> 06:52.444
- Three have anomalies.
- Okay, why is that significant?

06:52.478 --> 06:55.547
Well, the clearance between part
and gauge is critical to function.

06:55.581 --> 06:58.449
"Significant" means
"worth mentioning."

06:58.484 --> 07:01.518
Well, if a ball bearing is out-of-round,

07:01.553 --> 07:03.387
it can cause binding or excessive wear.

07:03.421 --> 07:05.556
- It's Frost. He has something.
- Oh, hallelujah.

07:05.590 --> 07:07.725
- Bye, Maura.
- Well, if they're not uniform,

07:07.759 --> 07:13.531
they won't reduce rotational friction
and support radial and axial loads.

07:17.202 --> 07:20.504
Jennifer and Ryan weren't
just costars in a play.

07:20.538 --> 07:22.439
Oh, they were costars in real life.

07:22.474 --> 07:24.908
Maybe that's why she was
hospitalized for shock.

07:24.943 --> 07:26.610
Yeah, or she needed
to disappear in a hurry

07:26.644 --> 07:28.312
before we could start
asking her questions.

07:28.346 --> 07:30.381
Check out this text Ryan
sent to her yesterday morning.

07:30.415 --> 07:33.342
- "I'm on a mission to get over you."
- What happened?

07:33.343 --> 07:35.519
From what I read, it looks
like she broke up with him,

07:35.553 --> 07:38.021
and he...
didn't take it very well.

07:38.056 --> 07:41.225
"No point in being alive without U."

07:41.259 --> 07:44.061
You think he committed
suicide by girlfriend?

07:44.095 --> 07:46.229
Maybe.
Or she killed him.

07:46.264 --> 07:48.732
What's the motive ...
he's a crybaby?

07:48.766 --> 07:52.002
Or a real ass...
if he let her think she killed him.

07:52.036 --> 07:54.204
Yeah, we need to talk to her.

07:57.709 --> 08:00.677
I didn't want to do the scene
with the gun. I told him that!

08:00.711 --> 08:02.112
Were you angry with Ryan?

08:02.146 --> 08:03.780
Yes!

08:03.814 --> 08:06.582
What were you thinking
when you pulled the trigger?

08:06.616 --> 08:08.017
Well, I was in character,

08:08.051 --> 08:10.619
so I was thinking about
how much Ryan pisses me off.

08:10.653 --> 08:14.356
Did Ryan show you how
to load a prop gun?

08:15.558 --> 08:17.426
But I couldn't do it with
my fingers.

08:17.460 --> 08:19.561
I fell and broke two knuckles.

08:21.063 --> 08:26.000
Jennifer, we think it's possible
that Ryan was committing suicide...

08:26.035 --> 08:29.704
- and he used you to do it.
- No. No way.

08:29.738 --> 08:32.006
Why ...
why would he kill himself?

08:33.775 --> 08:36.979
No, it was an accident.

08:37.013 --> 08:40.249
We were getting married.
Oh.

08:42.519 --> 08:47.123
He, uh...
he gave me this last night.

08:47.157 --> 08:51.259
But I-I couldn't get it on my finger.

08:51.294 --> 08:52.760
Why did you break up with him, then?

08:52.795 --> 08:55.263
'Cause he was always
complaining about his job.

08:55.297 --> 08:57.097
The maintenance job
at the Storrow center?

08:57.132 --> 08:59.266
Yeah.

08:59.300 --> 09:02.203
He said that there was too much
to do and that he was barely

09:02.204 --> 09:05.106
breaking even with all the
supplies and stuff.

09:05.140 --> 09:08.510
I just got tired of
listening to him complain.

09:08.544 --> 09:10.979
I mean, I told him to quit.

09:11.013 --> 09:12.814
He said he had to figure
something out first.

09:12.849 --> 09:14.850
Figure what out?

09:16.384 --> 09:17.887
He never said.

09:24.949 --> 09:28.940
It's nice that Lydia is brest feeding him.

09:28.975 --> 09:30.383
So much healthier.

09:30.417 --> 09:32.485
Plus, it's obvious why
he likes it so much.

09:32.519 --> 09:34.320
What does that mean?

09:34.354 --> 09:36.822
If I'm gonna feed it to him,
I got to try it, right?

09:40.593 --> 09:42.460
Excuse me one minute.

09:45.297 --> 09:47.098
Hope, how are you?

09:47.133 --> 09:49.774
I hope I'm not catching
you at a bad time.

09:49.802 --> 09:51.536
No, no. I was just
taking a quick break

09:51.571 --> 09:53.739
to visit with my son and grandson.

09:53.773 --> 09:55.574
It's nice to see you.

09:55.608 --> 09:59.178
I'm glad you two are
seeing each other again.

09:59.212 --> 10:02.949
- So, Maura told you?
- Told me what?

10:02.983 --> 10:05.017
Oh, uh...

10:05.051 --> 10:08.287
well, I have been...
e-mailing her,

10:08.321 --> 10:12.391
- but she hasn't responded.
- Have a seat.

10:15.463 --> 10:16.996
Well, she didn't tell me much,

10:17.031 --> 10:19.298
but I know you didn't
leave on good terms.

10:19.333 --> 10:23.036
I was, uh, so shocked.

10:23.070 --> 10:26.206
And I ... I didn't react well,

10:26.240 --> 10:28.709
I've never in my life
been as surprised...

10:28.743 --> 10:34.416
as I was when a grown
woman told me that she...

10:34.450 --> 10:37.786
is the baby that
I thought died at birth.

10:44.294 --> 10:48.497
How's, uh...
how's Cailin doing?

10:48.531 --> 10:51.500
She's doing very well.

10:56.440 --> 10:59.675
I know this isn't my business,

10:59.709 --> 11:05.614
although, uh, Maura ...
Maura is my business.

11:07.284 --> 11:09.119
Did you come here to ask her to ...

11:09.153 --> 11:12.989
Yes.
I came to see if she is still willing

11:13.024 --> 11:15.993
to donate one of her
kidneys to Cailin.

11:19.965 --> 11:21.099
Hey, Tommy, honey?

11:21.133 --> 11:24.269
Come here. Bring me T.J.

11:26.171 --> 11:31.509
- Oh, yeah.
- He really is a beautiful baby.

11:32.811 --> 11:38.549
You know, I would do anything
for any one of my children

11:38.583 --> 11:45.723
and for this baby.
So, no one ...

11:45.757 --> 11:49.360
no one can blame you for
wanting to save Cailin.

12:00.372 --> 12:03.173
- Can you scan for depression?
- Are you depressed?

12:03.208 --> 12:06.076
Only when you ask me that ...
no, I meant him.

12:06.211 --> 12:08.745
I don't understand why he would
kill himself that way, you know?

12:08.780 --> 12:12.049
- I mean, something's hinky here.
- I think you should talk to him.

12:12.083 --> 12:15.952
- He's dead, Maura.
- I meant Casey.

12:17.822 --> 12:20.824
- I'm scared.
- Of what?

12:20.859 --> 12:22.926
More rejection.

12:22.960 --> 12:26.029
He's only rejecting you out of fear.
and if you don't try

12:26.064 --> 12:29.833
to talk him out of a surgery that
could kill him, you'll regret it.

12:29.868 --> 12:32.002
Well, now I'm really scared.

12:35.774 --> 12:37.474
What is this?

12:39.410 --> 12:42.346
Why does he have
concrete in his tool box?

12:42.380 --> 12:44.881
I am so glad that you said
"concrete" and not "cement."

12:44.915 --> 12:46.916
Too many people think
it's the same thing,

12:46.951 --> 12:49.085
when cement is actually
a component of concrete.

12:49.119 --> 12:51.254
No, but why is he saving it?

12:51.288 --> 12:56.025
And why is he saving a
broken fluorescent light bulb,

12:56.059 --> 12:58.561
a copper pipe,
and a bent anchor bolt?

12:58.995 --> 13:02.231
Well, maybe
he needs to purchase more.

13:02.265 --> 13:04.466
Yeah, but it looked
like he was hiding it.

13:04.501 --> 13:07.103
" 'Creep'?
Epoxy. Recycled?"

13:07.137 --> 13:09.205
That's a strange list.

13:13.744 --> 13:17.580
Oh.
So, he xeroxed some plans.

13:17.614 --> 13:20.717
He was in charge of
maintenance for all three buildings.

13:20.751 --> 13:23.754
It makes sense that
he had building plans.

13:23.788 --> 13:26.056
What do you think that means?

13:29.828 --> 13:32.363
Oh, my god. Oh, my god!

13:32.397 --> 13:34.999
- It's your mother.
- Oh, my god.

13:35.034 --> 13:37.335
And my mother ...
my biological mother, Hope.

13:37.370 --> 13:39.604
She's in the café.
What is she doing here?

13:39.638 --> 13:41.639
She came to get your kidney?

13:42.074 --> 13:45.077
Stop.
Can you please go talk to her?

13:45.111 --> 13:49.648
What?! I ... why do I have ...
she's your... relative.

13:49.682 --> 13:51.282
Oh, no.
She rejected me.

13:51.317 --> 13:53.451
She said that I wasn't her daughter.

13:53.486 --> 13:55.687
But then she remembered
she needed your kidney

13:55.721 --> 13:57.522
for her real daughter, Cailin!

13:59.025 --> 14:00.391
I don't want to talk to her.

14:00.426 --> 14:02.760
But I ... I can't keep
ignoring her. It's rude.

14:02.795 --> 14:07.365
So... call her and tell
her to make an appointment.

14:07.400 --> 14:09.601
Good idea.

14:11.237 --> 14:14.806
But w...
No? All right.

14:20.680 --> 14:23.982
Dr. Martin.
Didn't you get my message?

14:24.017 --> 14:26.785
- I'm... very busy today.
- Yes, I did.

14:26.819 --> 14:29.254
But I would really like to talk to you.

14:32.391 --> 14:34.025
What do you want to talk about?

14:34.059 --> 14:38.696
When we met... I said that
I felt a strange kinship with you.

14:38.731 --> 14:45.135
You also, uh, said that conceiving me
was the biggest mistake of your life.

14:45.170 --> 14:49.306
I'm sorry that I said that.
Maura, I had no idea.

14:49.340 --> 14:52.509
Paddy told me
that our baby died.

14:52.543 --> 14:55.011
And I visited the grave.

14:55.046 --> 14:59.249
You're really trying to tell me
that you've never seen any of this?

14:59.284 --> 15:01.985
Paddy Doyle's capture
was international news.

15:02.020 --> 15:04.154
I closed the door on
that part of my life.

15:04.189 --> 15:07.824
Well... at least your 18-year-old
had the guts to confront me.

15:07.858 --> 15:10.027
You just denied your life.

15:10.061 --> 15:13.163
The Harvard girl who got
seduced by the ... the evil thug.

15:14.932 --> 15:17.333
And then you ran.

15:17.368 --> 15:20.236
I'm... very sorry.

15:22.205 --> 15:25.774
I had this...

15:25.808 --> 15:29.645
this stupid little-girl fantasy...

15:29.679 --> 15:35.316
that when we met, you'd be...

15:35.351 --> 15:37.518
everything that you are.

15:39.921 --> 15:43.757
But you'd want me.

15:43.791 --> 15:47.528
You'd be very happy
to know that I was alive.

15:49.765 --> 15:53.268
- I reacted badly.
- "Badly"?

15:53.302 --> 15:56.405
You accused me of lying.

15:56.439 --> 15:59.042
You told me that
I wasn't your daughter.

15:59.076 --> 16:02.612
I actually think that you
asked me what I wanted from you.

16:02.647 --> 16:06.383
- Yes, I did.
- And now you're back.

16:08.386 --> 16:11.822
Do you see Paddy Doyle
when you look at me?

16:11.857 --> 16:14.158
- Do you see evil?
- No.

16:14.192 --> 16:16.894
And I saw so much good
in your father.

16:16.928 --> 16:18.696
Paddy Doyle's not my father.

16:24.135 --> 16:29.006
I loved him.
And he was the ... still is ...

16:29.040 --> 16:32.343
the most complicated...

16:32.377 --> 16:36.513
intelligent, damaged human
being that I've ever met.

16:36.547 --> 16:41.919
- Why are you here?
- Cailin.

16:46.459 --> 16:51.030
Well...
I know what I should do ...

16:51.064 --> 16:54.801
give you my kidney
to save your daughter.

16:54.835 --> 16:58.204
But I'm your daughter, too.

16:58.239 --> 17:01.574
- I know that I have no right to ask you.
- You don't.

17:03.677 --> 17:06.444
I think you should go.

17:27.983 --> 17:31.520
Hello. I'm looking for Lieutenant
Colonel Casey Jones.

17:32.554 --> 17:36.524
He's not? Do you have any
idea when he'll be back?

17:36.558 --> 17:39.961
Okay. Thanks very much.

17:40.395 --> 17:43.364
- Guess what we found.
- What? No! I was gonna say that.

17:43.398 --> 17:46.400
Found this in the victim's glove box.

17:46.468 --> 17:51.005
That's weird.
I found this in the victim's tool box.

17:51.039 --> 17:52.774
We matched that chunk of concrete

17:52.808 --> 17:55.543
with this nasty dent in the
hood of Ryan's pickup truck.

17:55.577 --> 17:57.879
Ryan filed an
insurance claim three days ago.

17:57.913 --> 18:00.498
"A loose chunk of concrete
dropped from the ceiling

18:00.499 --> 18:02.984
of the garage at work
and caused this damage."

18:03.019 --> 18:04.820
Frost, can you pull up articles

18:04.854 --> 18:07.122
on the construction
of the Storrow center?

18:07.157 --> 18:08.390
Sure.

18:08.425 --> 18:10.492
Okay, so we've got concrete
that's fallen on Ryan's truck,

18:10.526 --> 18:13.895
concrete debris that he
hid in his tool box...

18:13.930 --> 18:18.599
Xeroxed plans for the Storrow center ...
what's that say to you?

18:18.634 --> 18:20.201
Well, his girlfriend
said he was complaining

18:20.235 --> 18:22.103
about all the maintenance
work he had to do.

18:22.137 --> 18:24.806
Which makes no sense. The Storrow
center's basically brand-new.

18:24.840 --> 18:27.342
Tenants only started
moving in eight months ago.

18:27.376 --> 18:29.711
And in other news,

18:29.745 --> 18:31.212
after three years of legal wrangling,

18:31.247 --> 18:33.148
developer Sam Nelson
won approval to build

18:33.182 --> 18:35.550
the billion-dollar Storrow center.

18:35.585 --> 18:38.420
I'm finally seeing my dream realized ...

18:38.455 --> 18:40.822
three towers with
combined office, retail,

18:40.857 --> 18:43.658
and living space next
to the Charles river.

18:43.693 --> 18:48.063
The Storrow center is my gift to Boston.

18:48.097 --> 18:52.067
His "gift." Did he mention the
billion dollars he's also pocketing?

18:52.101 --> 18:55.170
Says here he already has
four more contracts for city buildings,

18:55.204 --> 18:57.406
plus a mall and an office park.

18:57.440 --> 19:00.108
You think maybe Ryan was the
mosquito buzzing around him,

19:00.143 --> 19:02.744
complaining about chunks
of concrete and busted lights?

19:02.779 --> 19:04.680
Maybe.

19:04.714 --> 19:07.650
Although...

19:07.718 --> 19:09.218
look at this post-it I found.

19:09.252 --> 19:11.621
My father used to complain
all the time about creep.

19:11.655 --> 19:13.223
The ones your were dating?

19:13.257 --> 19:17.295
That's funny.
No.

19:18.329 --> 19:22.232
Ryan saved anchor
bolts with dried epoxy.

19:22.267 --> 19:24.234
He wrote "epoxy" on this post-it.

19:24.269 --> 19:27.038
Okay, creep can happen over
time. The concrete cracks,

19:27.039 --> 19:29.807
the anchor bolts pull
out, and the pipes burst.

19:29.841 --> 19:32.209
My father hated being blamed
when the pipes burst from creep.

19:32.243 --> 19:34.979
Maybe Ryan was finding problems
with the Storrow center buildings.

19:35.013 --> 19:36.814
Sam Nelson
would want to cover that up.

19:36.849 --> 19:38.649
What, enough to kill
one of his employees?

19:38.684 --> 19:39.917
Maybe.

19:39.952 --> 19:42.252
Billions of dollars at stake
for one maintenance guy?

19:44.890 --> 19:47.858
- What? Where you going?
- The Storrow center. It's not far.

19:47.926 --> 19:49.660
We don't have enough
to say hi to this guy.

19:49.695 --> 19:51.829
And you know sam Nelson has
a stadium full of lawyers.

19:51.863 --> 19:53.798
Yeah, we show our cards
now, we'll never get him.

19:53.832 --> 19:55.032
Can you guys relax?

19:55.100 --> 19:56.701
I'm just gonna snoop
around in the public areas.

19:56.769 --> 19:59.370
With your cellphone?
With the camera in my cellphone.

19:59.438 --> 20:01.706
Jane, can you give Tommy
and the baby a ride home?

20:01.773 --> 20:04.909
- Why can't you?
- I'm filling out paperwork.

20:04.943 --> 20:06.443
I don't have anything to do.

20:06.477 --> 20:08.512
I can drop them
after I take the photos.

20:08.546 --> 20:11.114
- Really? You're sure?
- Yeah. No problem.

20:11.149 --> 20:12.816
All right. Thanks.

20:14.018 --> 20:15.818
Good, 'cause Maura needs
a shoulder to cry on.

20:15.853 --> 20:18.321
- Why? What happened?
- Girl stuff.

20:18.355 --> 20:19.789
Ohh.

20:25.830 --> 20:29.801
- Maura, what are you doing?
- Looking for the oblivion of sleep.

20:29.835 --> 20:31.569
What about him? He doesn't mind.

20:31.604 --> 20:32.738
Okay. Come on.

20:32.805 --> 20:35.073
You're gonna get lip
gloss on your nice pillow.

20:35.141 --> 20:37.876
I don't care.

20:37.911 --> 20:39.778
I thought you told her
to make an appointment.

20:39.813 --> 20:41.514
She just showed up.

20:41.548 --> 20:43.215
Well, at least you got
to keep your kidney.

20:43.250 --> 20:44.783
No, no, no.
It wasn't even about that.

20:44.817 --> 20:46.852
I wasn't holding my kidney hostage.

20:46.886 --> 20:48.989
Okay, this conversation
just took a weird turn.

20:49.023 --> 20:51.124
- I can't believe I just did that.
- Wha... did what?

20:51.159 --> 20:54.127
I stopped being nice.
I said what I thought.

20:54.162 --> 20:58.498
I was really mad and hurt,
and I just... said it.

20:58.533 --> 21:00.166
Maura, that's good.

21:00.201 --> 21:02.335
That's okay, all right?
I'm proud of you.

21:02.369 --> 21:05.005
I feel nauseous. What did I say?
Why did I say it?

21:05.039 --> 21:06.806
Why ...
I don't even know what I said.

21:06.841 --> 21:08.875
Okay, okay.
Let's talk about something else.

21:08.909 --> 21:13.680
Ooh! Ball bearings.
You like to talk about ball bearings.

21:13.714 --> 21:16.749
Well, I'm almost certain that they
came from a computer hard drive,

21:16.783 --> 21:19.151
and the lab is trying to
track down the manufacturer.

21:19.185 --> 21:22.655
Okay. Good.
Speaking of balls,

21:22.689 --> 21:24.256
I strapped mine on and
called Casey's office.

21:24.290 --> 21:26.725
- You did?
- Mm-hmm.

21:26.760 --> 21:29.328
He took a leave of absence yesterday.

21:29.362 --> 21:31.864
Well, go talk to him now...
like right now.

21:31.898 --> 21:35.267
It's my lunch hour,
and I only have 43 minutes left.

21:35.302 --> 21:37.370
Well, that's enough time to
say what needs to be said.

21:37.404 --> 21:39.205
I don't know what needs to be said.

21:39.240 --> 21:43.276
Say "enough with the magical
thinking that could kill you

21:43.310 --> 21:45.678
or leave you a quadriplegic."

21:47.982 --> 21:50.383
Ohh, I don't know
why I'm doing this!

21:50.418 --> 21:56.089
'Cause you love him.

21:56.124 --> 21:59.125
 There's nowhere to park.

21:59.160 --> 22:01.728
You're a cop.
You can park anywhere.

22:01.762 --> 22:06.065
Yeah. Yeah, why not?
I'll only be a minute.

22:12.307 --> 22:16.844
Okay.
Oh. All right, T.J.

22:51.447 --> 22:53.415
Jane, what are ...
what are you doing here?

22:53.449 --> 22:57.920
- Can I talk to you?
- It's not a good time.

22:57.954 --> 23:00.756
Well, there's not gonna
be a better one.

23:14.237 --> 23:18.540
- It's not too pretty, is it?
- I didn't mean to come here unannounced.

23:18.574 --> 23:20.475
I'm not here to embarrass you, okay?

23:23.045 --> 23:27.916
I have tea, uh, water.
Can't drink alcohol.

23:27.950 --> 23:31.553
- Oh.
- Because of the surgery.

23:31.587 --> 23:35.056
Right.
So you're going through with it?

23:35.091 --> 23:37.392
Yeah. I am.

23:39.763 --> 23:41.764
Uhh...

23:41.798 --> 23:46.068
Maura seems to think that...
your spinal injury

23:46.103 --> 23:49.672
is in a place that's hard to repair.

23:49.706 --> 23:51.240
Yeah.

23:51.274 --> 23:54.510
Yeah, it is.

23:54.545 --> 23:59.749
And ... and that whatever surgical
procedure you're having is risky.

23:59.783 --> 24:03.353
It is ... very.

24:03.387 --> 24:07.324
Well, how risky?
Like, "you're gonna die" risky?

24:08.860 --> 24:11.896
More likely,
I'll end up a full paraplegic.

24:11.931 --> 24:15.500
- Oh, my god.
- I told you it wasn't romantic.

24:15.535 --> 24:19.672
Well, then, why do it?
Okay, why make things worse?

24:19.706 --> 24:22.675
This catheter.

24:26.479 --> 24:31.983
- I was about to put it in when y...
- Look, I'm ... I'm sorry.

24:34.420 --> 24:37.556
I'm not saying it doesn't
suck, okay? It does.

24:37.590 --> 24:39.424
All right?
But it's reality.

24:39.459 --> 24:42.827
And I can deal with reality
just as long as you talk to me.

24:42.862 --> 24:47.999
- Okay?
- Reality? I can't feel, Jane.

24:50.169 --> 24:54.205
I can't ...
not just here.

24:54.239 --> 24:57.575
I cannot feel anymore.

24:59.311 --> 25:00.944
I can't make love to you.

25:02.580 --> 25:04.548
I can deal with crutches
and the leg braces,

25:04.582 --> 25:09.386
and... I can even deal
with the catheters.

25:10.922 --> 25:13.724
I can't live without
being able to feel you.

25:16.661 --> 25:19.598
Give you children.

25:34.180 --> 25:36.347
Are you hungry?
You want some of this?

25:41.187 --> 25:44.789
Hey! What the hell do
you think you're doing?

25:44.824 --> 25:46.191
Who said you could take pictures here?

25:46.225 --> 25:48.460
Easy, Mr. Nelson.
Boston police.

25:48.494 --> 25:49.794
Do you have a warrant?

25:49.829 --> 25:52.163
Otherwise, I want you
off my property ... now.

25:52.198 --> 25:54.098
This part of Storrow center
is open to the public, sir.

25:54.133 --> 25:57.369
All right.
I'm gonna call my attorney.

25:58.671 --> 25:59.838
Damn.

25:59.872 --> 26:02.407
All right, when I get
back, I want you gone!

26:04.577 --> 26:07.378
- Oh, my god.
- What the hell?

26:07.413 --> 26:08.646
T.J.!

26:35.319 --> 26:38.421
Okay.
I guess I should go.

26:43.227 --> 26:44.628
It's Fr... I'm so sorry.

26:44.662 --> 26:46.797
- Frankie, again.
- Answer it.

26:46.831 --> 26:48.799
I-it could be an emergency.

26:48.833 --> 26:50.267
- Yes ... what?
- Jane?

26:50.302 --> 26:52.970
Jane, there's been a huge
collapse at the Storrow center.

26:53.004 --> 26:55.105
- You've got to get down here.
- Calm down, Fr... what?

26:55.139 --> 26:57.607
It's really ... listen to me!
That's where Tommy and Frost were, okay?

26:57.642 --> 26:59.242
- Oh, my ... okay.
- Just get down here, Jane!

26:59.276 --> 27:00.165
N... I'll be right there.

27:00.166 --> 27:01.945
- I'll be right there!
- Get down here! Now!

27:01.979 --> 27:03.947
What is it?

27:03.981 --> 27:07.150
Uh... my brother and my baby
nephew and my partner ...

27:07.185 --> 27:09.886
t... there's been a building
collapse in the back bay,

27:09.921 --> 27:13.857
- and they think they're trapped inside.
- Let me come with you.

27:13.891 --> 27:16.659
N-no.
I-I can't wait for you.

27:30.508 --> 27:34.577
Follow critical response protocol.
Everybody understand?

27:34.612 --> 27:36.546
Nothing we can do
about the people trapped

27:36.580 --> 27:38.548
in the subterranean
parking areas right now.

27:38.582 --> 27:41.050
We evacuate everybody else first.

27:41.084 --> 27:42.752
Captain Green!

27:42.786 --> 27:45.054
Detective Rizzoli ... my brother
and his baby and my partner

27:45.089 --> 27:46.556
are trapped in the
underground parking level P-3.

27:46.590 --> 27:49.258
I'm sorry, Detective.
That building is way too unstable

27:49.293 --> 27:50.793
to even think about that right now.

27:50.861 --> 27:52.762
No, but we have to go ...

27:53.796 --> 27:55.765
I've got three more
with internal injuries.

27:55.799 --> 27:59.034
- Okay, transport the head injury.
- Maura!

27:59.068 --> 28:00.603
- Maura!!
- What is it?

28:00.637 --> 28:03.907
They're inside the building...
Frost and Tommy and T.J.

28:03.941 --> 28:05.141
Oh, my god. Are you sure?

28:05.209 --> 28:07.410
Jane! Jane.

28:07.445 --> 28:08.979
I couldn't find them.

28:09.046 --> 28:12.249
We were pulling out bodies
a-and people with broken bones.

28:12.283 --> 28:15.419
We got to as many of them as we could
before they ordered us out.

28:15.453 --> 28:18.155
They're afraid that the entire
building is gonna collapse.

28:18.189 --> 28:19.890
It's built from recycled concrete.

28:19.925 --> 28:22.259
- What?
- The lab results came back

28:22.294 --> 28:24.161
on the concrete
samples that you found.

28:24.229 --> 28:26.264
It's recycled ...
ground-up concrete debris,

28:26.298 --> 28:28.633
not the more durable
concrete made from hard rock.

28:28.668 --> 28:31.437
Ryan's list. "Recycled."
He knew.

28:31.471 --> 28:34.140
W-what other shortcuts
did this builder take?

28:34.174 --> 28:36.742
They can't find him.
Sam Nelson, the developer ...

28:36.777 --> 28:38.611
he was last seen leaving
right before the collapse.

28:38.645 --> 28:40.679
He's probably halfway
to the Marshall Islands by now.

28:40.747 --> 28:42.515
Okay, look, you don't
say a word to Ma, okay,

28:42.549 --> 28:43.983
until we're sure they're in there.

28:44.017 --> 28:46.585
Dr. Isles?
We've got more coming.

28:46.619 --> 28:49.188
Maura, go. Go.

28:49.256 --> 28:51.256
Come on.
We're going in there.

28:51.291 --> 28:53.158
They won't let anyone
past them. I tried.

28:53.193 --> 28:54.660
Okay, so we try again.
Come on.

28:54.694 --> 28:58.130
Jane. Jane, wait.
You can't.

28:58.164 --> 29:00.265
You can't.

29:03.637 --> 29:05.438
I hope they're still alive in there.

29:05.472 --> 29:06.472
I know.
I know. I know.

29:27.426 --> 29:30.595
Ohh, T.J.!

29:30.630 --> 29:32.664
T.J.!
Daddy's right here!

29:32.698 --> 29:35.100
Daddy's right here!
It's gonna be okay!

29:35.134 --> 29:38.236
It's gonna be okay, T.J.

29:38.270 --> 29:43.910
You hang in there, buddy, okay?
D-detective Frost!

29:47.882 --> 29:49.750
I'm here. I'm here.

29:49.784 --> 29:52.319
My head is killing me.

30:07.833 --> 30:11.268
I can't get my arm out.

30:11.302 --> 30:12.736
Help over here!

30:12.771 --> 30:14.972
Local 4 operating engineers are
sending in more heavy equipment.

30:15.006 --> 30:16.473
Well, tell them to get a move on.

30:16.508 --> 30:18.092
Okay. And I'll reach
out to, uh, building

30:18.093 --> 30:19.676
collapse units in
Connecticut and New York.

30:19.744 --> 30:21.111
Councilman DeLuth, Captain
Green, we need to talk to you.

30:21.145 --> 30:22.947
We're doing all we can, Detective.

30:22.981 --> 30:24.848
- It's bad concrete.
- What?

30:24.916 --> 30:26.283
The builder ... he
used recycled concrete.

30:26.318 --> 30:27.451
That's what caused the collapse.

30:27.486 --> 30:29.821
No, that wouldn't be enough
to cause such a catastrophic failure.

30:29.855 --> 30:31.790
I-I spoke with the structural
engineers who built it.

30:31.824 --> 30:33.725
They think that it was
a combination of the heavy rains

30:33.759 --> 30:36.128
and the additional stories that
the developer added to building 3.

30:36.162 --> 30:38.197
So, maybe vibrations
from the heavy equipment

30:38.264 --> 30:40.332
and the additional pilings
compromised building 1?

30:40.366 --> 30:42.534
- Yes.
- We want to go in.

30:42.601 --> 30:44.669
Our brother and our nephew
are trapped inside there.

30:44.703 --> 30:46.738
I don't want a marble rolling
around in there right now.

30:46.772 --> 30:49.340
It's not a question of if
that building is coming down.

30:49.374 --> 30:51.008
It's a question when.

30:51.042 --> 30:53.857
I promise you,
if we can get enough equipment

30:53.858 --> 30:56.280
in there and shore it up,
I'll go in there myself.

30:56.314 --> 30:57.815
 Captain Green!

31:03.688 --> 31:06.557
 Initial GCS of 5.
Point tenderness at the left parietal.

31:06.625 --> 31:08.726
Internal bleeding.
He needs to get to Beth Israel.

31:08.793 --> 31:10.294
I'm out of transport right now.

31:10.328 --> 31:12.295
Get a police car and
get him out of here.

31:12.330 --> 31:13.864
Hey, you got a car?

31:13.898 --> 31:16.967
Dr. Isles. What can I do?

31:17.001 --> 31:20.170
Fema put out a call to all
off-duty nurses and doctors,

31:20.204 --> 31:22.305
so I just came as soon as I heard.

31:22.339 --> 31:27.210
Thank you. Can you assess
the patients over there?

31:27.244 --> 31:30.146
I think that woman
has a fractured femur.

31:32.049 --> 31:35.018
Hello, ma'am.
I understand you're in pain.

31:35.052 --> 31:37.487
Which leg is it, please?
This one? All right.

31:37.521 --> 31:38.922
That's all right. It'll be okay.

31:38.989 --> 31:42.258
Nothing so far?
Okay, just keep looking.

31:42.326 --> 31:43.926
I'm sorry, Jane.
Frost is better at this.

31:43.994 --> 31:45.395
You're doing fine, okay?

31:45.429 --> 31:49.932
Just get to the P-3 camera at
about... maybe like 1:15 or so.

31:49.999 --> 31:51.400
Okay. Almost there.

31:53.036 --> 31:54.503
Jane, I got something.

32:01.278 --> 32:04.680
- That doesn't mean they're alive.
- It means they're in there.

32:04.715 --> 32:06.115
I can't risk other lives.

32:06.183 --> 32:07.883
There's a 3-month-old
baby in there.

32:07.918 --> 32:09.852
- We can't just stand here!
- Ah!

32:09.886 --> 32:12.088
I'm letting you stay out
of courtesy, Detective,

32:12.122 --> 32:13.956
but if you try to go into that garage,

32:14.024 --> 32:16.359
I will put you on the other
side of that barricade!

32:21.231 --> 32:23.099
Code 1, evac ... move it!

32:32.791 --> 32:33.924
Don't give up.

32:33.958 --> 32:35.626
- I'm not. I'm not.
- Okay.

32:35.660 --> 32:39.529
I don't know how to scan
these plans. Do you see that?

32:39.597 --> 32:40.964
Yeah, sort of.

32:40.998 --> 32:43.833
All right.
He circled a section on P-3.

32:43.868 --> 32:45.935
- Okay.
- This looks like an arrow.

32:45.970 --> 32:48.304
He's got a rectangle
labeled "P-3 floor"

32:48.338 --> 32:50.940
and then a circle with
a question mark inside.

32:50.974 --> 32:53.976
No, but maybe there's
something under P-3.

32:54.011 --> 32:55.444
P-3 is the lowest level.

32:55.479 --> 32:58.548
Jane! Jane.

32:58.615 --> 33:00.883
The lab was able to trace the
ball bearings used to kill Ryan

33:00.951 --> 33:02.952
back to 500 recalled computers.

33:02.986 --> 33:05.321
- Okay. Okay. I'm talking to Korsak.
- No, listen to me.

33:05.355 --> 33:08.457
Most of those computers were
purchased for city employees,

33:08.492 --> 33:10.760
including all 13 city counselors.

33:12.196 --> 33:14.564
Korsak, find out the name
of the concrete company

33:14.632 --> 33:16.699
that supplied the
concrete to Sam Nelson.

33:16.734 --> 33:19.869
Give me a sec.
Give me a sec. Give me a sec.

33:22.439 --> 33:26.676
Koneff Concrete.
Looking for the owner.

33:26.710 --> 33:29.412
Claire Koneff DeLuth.

33:29.480 --> 33:31.781
- The wife of the councilman?
- Oh, god.

33:31.815 --> 33:33.883
They put the concrete
company in her name

33:33.917 --> 33:35.584
to avoid conflict of interest.

33:36.853 --> 33:40.388
Thanks. Here you go.

33:40.423 --> 33:42.891
We really appreciate
everything you guys are doing.

33:42.925 --> 33:44.692
You know, this is a hard thing ...

33:44.726 --> 33:46.895
- Was it worth it?
- Sorry?

33:46.929 --> 33:49.663
This ... all so you could pocket
a few hundred-thousand more?

33:49.698 --> 33:51.432
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

33:51.499 --> 33:54.101
No?
Okay, how about you?

33:54.169 --> 33:56.670
You loaded that prop
gun with ball bearings.

33:56.705 --> 34:01.809
You watched Jennifer pull the trigger.
How was it watching Ryan die?

34:01.843 --> 34:04.345
- It was awful.
- My god. Claire, don't.

34:04.379 --> 34:07.013
Ryan came to you for help because
you were married to a city councilman,

34:07.048 --> 34:08.982
and he wasn't getting
anywhere with the builder,

34:09.016 --> 34:10.751
who didn't know you
used recycled concrete.

34:10.784 --> 34:13.687
We had no idea
that this could happen.

34:13.721 --> 34:15.589
Stop talking. Stop talking, Claire!
Stop talking.

34:15.623 --> 34:19.592
We underbid the project.
It wasn't all bad concrete.

34:19.627 --> 34:21.061
Ohh, just some of it.

34:21.094 --> 34:24.063
You're both under arrest for
the murder of Ryan Granger.

34:24.098 --> 34:25.732
And let's hope today's body count

34:25.766 --> 34:28.243
doesn't get over seven, because
if it does, you're both going down

34:28.244 --> 34:29.369
- for those murders, too!
- We didn't know.

34:29.402 --> 34:30.370
- Now, shut up, Claire!
- I swear we didn't know.

34:30.404 --> 34:32.038
Put your hands behind your back.

34:32.072 --> 34:34.206
- Come on. Let's go. Move!
- Yeah?

34:34.241 --> 34:37.177
I found something.
There's a tunnel under P-3.

34:37.210 --> 34:39.344
What?
W-what do you mean?

34:39.379 --> 34:42.681
I checked old MBTA records.
There's an abandoned subway work tunnel.

34:42.715 --> 34:45.617
Koneff Cconcrete was supposed to
fill that tunnel with concrete

34:45.652 --> 34:47.485
and reinforce it with concrete piers.

34:47.554 --> 34:49.588
You thinking what I'm thinking?

34:49.621 --> 34:52.791
Yeah, they skipped that
part to pocket an extra 500k.

34:52.824 --> 34:54.926
Which means that tunnel's still there.

35:00.166 --> 35:04.370
- You don't have to do this.
- Oh. Now you tell me.

35:04.404 --> 35:09.642
- What are all these cans?
- Old civil defense water cans.

35:09.676 --> 35:11.510
They used to store them here.

35:11.578 --> 35:15.081
Little did they know,
it wasn't a very effective

35:15.082 --> 35:17.350
atomic bomb shelter
because of the chimney effect.

35:18.752 --> 35:19.852
Can we talk about this later?

35:24.591 --> 35:27.927
- Please go back.
- No!

35:38.706 --> 35:40.909
Tommy?

35:42.444 --> 35:46.447
Yeah? What does it mean when
I feel like I got to puke?

35:46.481 --> 35:48.482
It means you have a head injury.

35:52.287 --> 35:54.789
Hey, the baby's not
making any noise, Barry.

35:54.823 --> 35:58.325
He's okay.
I know he's okay.

36:02.897 --> 36:07.166
- You got a girlfriend?
- Nah.

36:07.200 --> 36:11.203
- Are you gay?
- No.

36:11.237 --> 36:14.973
I had a big crush on your
sister for a long time.

36:15.007 --> 36:18.276
On my sister?
You mean Jane?

36:18.311 --> 36:22.447
- You got another sister?
- I liked Maura.

36:22.481 --> 36:24.949
Dr. Isles? That's your type?

36:24.984 --> 36:28.386
I like Lydia, too.
You know what?

36:28.420 --> 36:31.388
If y-you could just put
the two of them together...

36:31.423 --> 36:33.324
they'd be the perfect woman.

36:33.358 --> 36:34.692
I mean, right?

36:36.829 --> 36:41.032
You know what I'm gonna
do if we get out of here?

36:41.066 --> 36:43.568
- Marry Lydia?
- No.

36:44.604 --> 36:46.038
I'm gonna sue the ...

36:59.386 --> 37:01.453
I don't think we can go
any further.

37:03.924 --> 37:06.659
Oh.
Let me check here.

37:10.264 --> 37:14.233
Maura, I can't tell my
mother that my brother's dead.

37:15.936 --> 37:19.205
Jane. Look.
Look.

37:19.240 --> 37:22.509
That's them. That's them!

37:26.147 --> 37:29.082
- Come on.
- They're almost there, Jane.

37:29.116 --> 37:31.317
That's it. We're through.

37:31.385 --> 37:34.421
All right, get them up there.
Ready?

37:37.792 --> 37:39.527
 Is anybody in here?!

37:39.561 --> 37:41.596
Stay clear of the opening.

37:43.732 --> 37:46.301
Oh, my god.

37:46.335 --> 37:49.437
M-Maura, he's not moving.

37:51.174 --> 37:53.475
- That's a vigorous cry, Jane.
- He's okay. Okay.

37:55.745 --> 37:58.446
All right, get that baby out of here.

37:58.481 --> 38:01.416
Come on, Jane. Come on.
Jane, come on!

38:07.793 --> 38:09.461
Ohh. Shh.

38:09.495 --> 38:12.297
Ohh, baby, baby.
Oh, come on.

38:12.331 --> 38:14.799
T.J., T.J.
Oh, yeah, you're okay.

38:14.834 --> 38:15.967
Anything?

38:21.340 --> 38:23.141
There's Frost!

38:24.177 --> 38:27.312
- Frost!
- How you doing, ma'am?

38:27.346 --> 38:28.346
Thank god.

38:28.413 --> 38:31.015
- Hey.
- You all right?

38:31.082 --> 38:33.150
Yeah ... busted arm.
I-I think that's it.

38:33.185 --> 38:34.485
It's good to see you, man.

38:35.821 --> 38:36.988
Boy, you sure know how to make an exit.

38:37.022 --> 38:40.357
 Where's Tommy?
I don't see Tommy!

38:40.425 --> 38:43.193
Oh, my god!
There's Tommy! Tommy!

38:44.595 --> 38:46.662
Hey, man. How ...
how you doing?

38:46.697 --> 38:50.299
I'm okay. Exc...
except for my head.

38:50.334 --> 38:53.035
- Is T.J. okay?
- Yeah, yeah. He's right here.

38:53.103 --> 38:55.471
He's right here, baby.
He's fine.

38:55.505 --> 38:58.274
- Oh, Tommy!
- Oh. I'm okay, mom.

38:58.308 --> 39:01.010
Ta... just make sure
Lydia pumps for him, okay?

39:01.045 --> 39:02.779
Okay, but we'll
take good care of him.

39:03.814 --> 39:05.081
I love you, baby.

39:10.488 --> 39:11.721
Let's load him up!

39:11.789 --> 39:13.990
Come on, take him!
Take him!

39:16.861 --> 39:24.669
- I want to help Cailin.
- She told me what she said to you.

39:24.703 --> 39:30.674
She said, "I don't want
any part of you living in me."

39:31.810 --> 39:34.178
I'm so sorry.

39:37.416 --> 39:41.586
We all say and do stupid things.

39:41.654 --> 39:45.791
I'll have Boston General's
transplant unit arrange everything.

39:45.825 --> 39:48.326
I ...
I don't want Cailin to ever know.

39:49.495 --> 39:52.497
- Maura ...
- No. Promise me.

39:52.532 --> 39:55.334
I promise.

39:57.504 --> 40:00.706
Can I ... would it be
all right with you if...

40:05.211 --> 40:09.213
I will never be able to thank you.

40:26.865 --> 40:29.801
How long you been here?

40:29.869 --> 40:32.971
I didn't want to leave
until I knew they were safe.

40:33.039 --> 40:34.372
Thank you.

40:36.609 --> 40:38.877
I'm sorry for what I said about...

40:38.911 --> 40:41.647
not being able to wait for you.

40:41.681 --> 40:42.981
- It just slipped out.
- It's okay.

40:45.084 --> 40:49.721
- Go be with your family.
- Well, what about you?

40:49.755 --> 40:53.758
I'll be okay.
Or I won't.

40:53.792 --> 40:54.992
It's my choice.

41:11.075 --> 41:13.309
Are you okay?

41:13.344 --> 41:18.181
Yeah. It's just 
another day at the office, huh?

41:19.683 --> 41:22.085
You okay?

41:22.119 --> 41:24.488
Yeah.
