02:40.693 --> 02:41.927
<i>Allaho akbar!</i>

02:41.929 --> 02:44.296
All:
<i>Allaho akbar!</i>

05:17.016 --> 05:19.618
Sepehr:
Shiraz tar.

05:19.620 --> 05:23.655
Sweet. Strong. Burns easy just
the way you like it.

05:23.657 --> 05:25.957
Grand for an ounce.

05:35.668 --> 05:39.938
If Safinia find out you're
dealing here...

05:39.940 --> 05:43.475
Who's gonna tell? You?

05:44.677 --> 05:46.778
Safinia owns the property.
Not me.

05:46.780 --> 05:49.081
Who I do business with is no
concern to him.

05:50.583 --> 05:52.651
Just like...

05:52.653 --> 05:57.089
Who you fuck
is no concern to me.

05:57.091 --> 05:59.391
What's going on here?

06:02.395 --> 06:05.030
Are you alright?

06:05.032 --> 06:08.533
Sasha's just a kid. Why don't
you give him a break?

06:11.003 --> 06:14.039
Is he your kid?

06:14.041 --> 06:17.609
No. He's not my kid.

06:17.611 --> 06:19.945
But is this your beard?

06:22.448 --> 06:24.116
Oh...

06:34.994 --> 06:37.629
An addict

06:37.631 --> 06:39.631
and a whore.

06:43.503 --> 06:46.671
Here's to your holy union.

07:29.817 --> 07:32.584
What are you doing?

07:32.586 --> 07:36.621
You know if you take a few
thousand more of these

07:36.623 --> 07:38.690
you can cover all the walls.

07:38.692 --> 07:42.194
What are you saying? You don't
like the wall paper?

07:44.764 --> 07:46.865
It's a nice touch.

07:48.202 --> 07:50.569
You said I could do anything to
the apartment.

07:50.571 --> 07:51.937
Yeah. But...

07:51.939 --> 07:53.872
Welcome to anything.

08:02.181 --> 08:05.016
I saw Sepehr today.

08:10.022 --> 08:11.990
Why would you bring that up
right now?

08:11.992 --> 08:13.758
Because.

08:13.760 --> 08:16.995
I'm worried for Sasha.

08:24.837 --> 08:26.972
Oksana:
Your nails are filthy.

08:46.826 --> 08:48.560
I saw...

08:54.166 --> 08:55.700
I saw Sasha today.

08:57.003 --> 08:59.905
Your son Oksana...

09:02.141 --> 09:03.909
Sepehr...

09:05.211 --> 09:07.879
Sepehr is lost.

09:10.149 --> 09:12.250
He's no father.

09:15.922 --> 09:18.790
I have the money.

09:18.792 --> 09:21.626
I'll get more if we need.

09:23.596 --> 09:26.898
Let's just get the fuck
out of here.

09:26.900 --> 09:29.634
You me and Sasha.

09:37.877 --> 09:41.580
You, me and Sasha.

09:46.786 --> 09:49.621
Oksana:
Who are you talking to?

09:51.123 --> 09:53.291
Why are you dressed?

09:53.293 --> 09:56.094
I have work.

09:56.096 --> 09:59.698
Work? Your boss is away.
It's Friday.

10:04.103 --> 10:08.006
It's the Persian Princess,
isn't it?

10:08.008 --> 10:09.975
Safinia doesn't
take you seriously.

10:09.977 --> 10:11.209
It's a favour.

10:11.211 --> 10:12.877
A favour?

10:12.879 --> 10:15.280
Driving his daughter and her
friends around

10:15.282 --> 10:16.781
<i>so they can party?</i>

10:16.783 --> 10:18.383
<i>You are like his peasant.</i>

10:18.385 --> 10:21.720
And what was I before?

10:36.636 --> 10:40.138
Behrouz:
When I sell my first property...

10:40.140 --> 10:42.841
Let's take a trip.

10:42.843 --> 10:44.976
Oksana:
<i>Why?</i>

10:44.978 --> 10:48.146
Because that's what people do.

10:48.148 --> 10:50.348
They take trips.

10:55.121 --> 10:59.124
So... take a trip
with your Princess.

11:11.370 --> 11:13.104
Woman:
<i>Beh-roooouz...</i>

11:15.307 --> 11:20.245
<i>Didn't daddy tell you to pick me
up or was I just dreaming?</i>

11:20.247 --> 11:22.013
<i>We're at the key club.</i>

11:22.015 --> 11:26.451
<i>Come soon or you'll miss out on
all the fun.</i>

12:12.732 --> 12:15.500
Did she give you ecstasy?

12:15.502 --> 12:19.337
No one gave me anything.
I bought it.

12:19.339 --> 12:20.872
Your father would kill me.

12:20.874 --> 12:22.073
Me first.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.274
Sara?

12:23.276 --> 12:25.376
Don't be a hypocrite.

12:25.378 --> 12:29.180
You think I don't know all your
dirty little secrets...

12:29.182 --> 12:30.815
Beh-rooouz?

12:36.422 --> 12:37.856
You're late.

12:39.492 --> 12:40.992
Where were you?

12:40.994 --> 12:42.927
Business.

12:42.929 --> 12:45.430
I thought I was your business.

12:45.432 --> 12:47.866
La-la needs her... la-la.

12:50.069 --> 12:54.773
La-la likes you. She wants to
play with your gun?

12:54.775 --> 12:56.541
I don't have a gun.

13:18.330 --> 13:20.532
Bit young for you, no?

13:22.935 --> 13:26.304
Jesus, Behrouz. Smile, Baba.

13:31.545 --> 13:34.078
Reza Raed's cousin, Danush.

13:34.080 --> 13:37.315
Just come from Tehran.
No English.

13:43.923 --> 13:45.456
He did.

13:48.994 --> 13:53.398
I think he come back to
play with old friends.

13:54.967 --> 13:57.435
Where's your... Jew?

13:57.437 --> 13:58.970
Honeymoon.

14:01.574 --> 14:04.008
Well why don't we take a little
trip, Baba?

14:36.508 --> 14:38.877
Lola:
How are you, Behrouz-Jan?

14:40.913 --> 14:44.315
I'm late, Lola.
What do you want?

14:52.424 --> 14:54.025
To family.

15:08.507 --> 15:13.511
Tell me Behrouz-Jan, fighting
for a place in the sun?

15:13.513 --> 15:16.381
Or do you still prefer
the shadows?

15:16.383 --> 15:18.917
I'm no longer in that line
of work.

15:18.919 --> 15:22.287
Babysitting Babak
Safinia's daughter?

15:22.289 --> 15:24.022
A favour for him.

15:24.024 --> 15:27.225
You used to do favours
for Cirrus.

15:27.227 --> 15:29.093
And some for me.

15:31.430 --> 15:34.666
I'm in real estate now.

15:34.668 --> 15:38.269
With Safinia, that Jew?

15:38.271 --> 15:41.239
Persian Jews are like
Russian whores.

15:41.241 --> 15:45.209
The longer they know you,
the more they charge.

15:45.211 --> 15:47.145
Are you done?

15:47.147 --> 15:50.014
Cirrus truly adores you.

15:52.284 --> 15:54.585
He said when you first came to
this country

15:54.587 --> 15:57.689
you were lost, confused.

15:57.691 --> 16:00.291
You were like a boat
with no anchor.

16:01.660 --> 16:06.230
And look at you now.
A real estate man.

16:06.232 --> 16:09.334
Behrouz! Sara's looking for you.

16:14.440 --> 16:16.574
We'll be at valet.

16:25.185 --> 16:26.384
Goodbye, Lola.

16:32.157 --> 16:34.559
Do you still play cards?

16:36.662 --> 16:39.197
A ten thousand dollar buy-in.

16:44.136 --> 16:48.639
But then you've got
favours to attend.

16:51.577 --> 16:53.111
Lola:
Don't...

16:56.281 --> 16:59.317
forget what he did for you.

17:35.354 --> 17:38.256
Sara/friends:
<i>Ramen! Ramen! Ramen!</i>

17:38.258 --> 17:40.124
Sara?

17:41.661 --> 17:44.262
Sara, can you take a cab?

17:52.071 --> 17:53.371
What happened?

17:53.373 --> 17:54.739
Nothing.

17:54.741 --> 17:57.809
I need you to take a cab.
I have something to do.

17:57.811 --> 18:00.211
What the fuck, Behrouz? Cab?

18:00.213 --> 18:02.847
So Uber. I have things to do.

18:02.849 --> 18:05.516
Like that gaudy chick in VIP?

18:05.518 --> 18:07.151
What gaudy chick?

18:20.499 --> 18:21.833
Sara...

18:24.536 --> 18:25.837
Please...

18:25.839 --> 18:28.172
Don't tell your father.

18:41.186 --> 18:45.590
Don't worry. I'll make sure she
gets home Ok.

18:47.159 --> 18:49.293
Come on.

20:07.874 --> 20:09.874
Oh-oh-oh...

20:09.876 --> 20:14.378
Calm down, pussy cat.
You know the drill, Baba.

20:19.785 --> 20:22.753
Ooohhh...

20:22.755 --> 20:24.522
Big spender, huh?

20:43.642 --> 20:46.310
I like your face.

20:46.312 --> 20:47.578
Good face.

20:47.580 --> 20:48.946
Ugh...

20:48.948 --> 20:50.881
Child's face.

20:55.420 --> 20:57.455
I like your face too.

21:13.538 --> 21:15.840
Behrouz-Jan...

21:15.842 --> 21:18.309
I'm delighted you could make it.

21:19.978 --> 21:22.580
Cirrus will be so pleased.

21:22.582 --> 21:23.881
Come. Sit.

22:11.663 --> 22:14.598
Cirrus:
<i>Apologies for my tardiness.</i>

22:17.469 --> 22:20.371
<i>I'm not a Persian prince.</i>

22:25.911 --> 22:28.079
Ahh...

22:28.081 --> 22:32.049
But this man...

22:32.051 --> 22:33.451
This man...

22:34.720 --> 22:38.089
Is a knight in shining Armour.

22:41.059 --> 22:44.495
At thirteen this man
joined the Basiji

22:44.497 --> 22:48.566
to be a solider of god.

22:48.568 --> 22:52.870
Yet he survived Khomeini's
culture of death.

22:54.973 --> 22:57.942
He came to America

22:57.944 --> 23:00.911
with anguish in his eyes

23:00.913 --> 23:04.615
and blood on his shirt

23:07.819 --> 23:11.422
I took him in

23:11.424 --> 23:16.727
and turned that forsaken child
into a man.

23:19.164 --> 23:21.699
I turned him into a man.

23:24.102 --> 23:26.637
Yet six months ago he left me.

23:29.541 --> 23:31.175
How I suffered his loss

23:32.577 --> 23:35.546
how I suffered his absence.

23:37.416 --> 23:39.850
And now look at him...

23:39.852 --> 23:41.752
<i>A real estate man.</i>

23:41.754 --> 23:43.788
Men:

23:43.790 --> 23:45.656
<i>Bravo!</i>

23:45.658 --> 23:49.894
Bravo, Behrouz-Jan!

23:49.896 --> 23:51.429
Bravo.

23:57.436 --> 23:59.970
Now tell us, Behrouz.

24:02.007 --> 24:03.207
What was it like?

24:05.811 --> 24:07.645
What was it like

24:07.647 --> 24:12.516
to fight for god's own will?

24:51.823 --> 24:53.190
Cirrus:
I re-raise.

24:59.064 --> 25:01.232
Card player:
I fucking quit.

25:01.234 --> 25:03.801
I wanna go get some kebab.

26:08.133 --> 26:09.333
Excuse me.

26:09.335 --> 26:11.869
Cirrus:
Tell me again, Behrouz.

26:13.738 --> 26:16.073
Where did you learn to play?

26:19.044 --> 26:21.345
The war.

26:22.981 --> 26:25.849
You picked up a few
nasty habits there,

26:25.851 --> 26:27.718
didn't you?

27:57.676 --> 28:00.978
Take his money and fuck me.

28:00.980 --> 28:04.948
Make me a wound,
pour yourself onto me.

28:20.198 --> 28:22.700
No. Oh my god...

28:40.019 --> 28:42.019
Wow.

28:52.063 --> 28:55.199
I like the smell of your brand.

29:11.883 --> 29:14.351
Farid:
<i>Old habits die hard, huh?</i>

29:17.889 --> 29:21.391
<i>Three grams a day.
Sometimes four, Bezy.</i>

29:23.128 --> 29:26.897
She has to smoke more opium than
you just to fall asleep.

29:29.033 --> 29:30.868
How do you sleep, Bezy?

29:32.871 --> 29:35.272
On a California king.

29:45.483 --> 29:50.254
You think you're better than me,
Mr. real estate man?

29:57.295 --> 30:01.431
No matter how hard you pray
there's a whole forest of bodies

30:01.433 --> 30:03.433
you can't wash away.

31:08.867 --> 31:11.869
"Infidel with faithful."

31:13.972 --> 31:16.306
"And faithful with infidel."

31:21.980 --> 31:27.451
Cirrus: For years I suffered guilt
for not dying with my brothers.

31:30.322 --> 31:33.891
Guilt is a terrible thing.

31:35.627 --> 31:38.128
It lingers...

31:39.330 --> 31:40.964
It festers.

31:43.902 --> 31:46.570
They say Jesus died of it.

31:50.541 --> 31:53.043
Oh, Behrouz-Jan...

31:57.215 --> 31:59.583
Your call, Basiji.

32:01.119 --> 32:02.352
Agh!

32:20.471 --> 32:25.242
Do you know how they cure drug
addicts in Iran?

32:25.244 --> 32:28.612
They torture the darkness out.

32:28.614 --> 32:33.183
But your darkness, Behrouz,
runs bone deep.

32:35.353 --> 32:40.090
During the revolution,
Khomeini's dogs

32:40.092 --> 32:43.694
would round up the
shah's council.

32:46.164 --> 32:50.968
Place a gun with three bullets
to their head,

32:50.970 --> 32:53.236
pull the trigger

32:53.238 --> 32:56.306
and leave the rest to god.

33:39.151 --> 33:41.184
Argh...!

33:55.400 --> 33:57.701
God favours you, Basiji.

34:00.238 --> 34:02.105
Don't let him down.

35:20.718 --> 35:22.385
Fuck.

35:49.847 --> 35:51.281
Sepehr...

35:58.556 --> 36:00.157
Cirrus:
What did he do?

36:01.726 --> 36:03.426
What did he do?

36:14.572 --> 36:16.706
His life

36:16.708 --> 36:18.341
or yours.

36:18.343 --> 36:20.410
Cirrus-Jan, please.
For the love of god...

37:21.672 --> 37:26.009
Why does cirrus Golshiri want me
to kill you?

37:30.648 --> 37:32.382
I'll make tea.

37:44.028 --> 37:46.529
You know what they said
to me earlier?

37:47.932 --> 37:50.600
Why do you still let
that man come here?

37:50.602 --> 37:52.669
He's not one of us.

37:54.305 --> 37:56.840
He's a loner. Gangster.

37:58.376 --> 37:59.743
Killer.

37:59.745 --> 38:01.911
My fucking god...

38:06.684 --> 38:10.820
America's a country full
of loners and thieves

38:10.822 --> 38:13.857
who kill for money and ego.

38:19.030 --> 38:20.430
In Iran...

38:22.300 --> 38:25.068
the value of a man is worth
what he gives, not takes.

38:28.407 --> 38:30.740
My father gave his life on the
road to Karbala...

38:30.742 --> 38:32.409
Fuck your father!

38:35.346 --> 38:37.447
Why are you here?

38:42.053 --> 38:44.921
Why does Cirrus want you dead?

39:03.507 --> 39:04.941
Agh!

39:10.081 --> 39:12.716
Ah...!

39:18.122 --> 39:20.056
Oh!

39:39.143 --> 39:41.978
Agh!

40:26.590 --> 40:28.725
Agh!

40:36.033 --> 40:38.668
What are you doing? Stop it!

40:38.670 --> 40:40.703
What are you doing!?

40:57.621 --> 41:00.590
Help! Help!

41:19.710 --> 41:22.579
You thought I was
going to kill you?

41:22.581 --> 41:24.647
You thought I was going
to kill you?!

41:24.649 --> 41:26.549
I wouldn't tell you!

41:26.551 --> 41:28.918
I would fucking kill you,
you fucking idiot!

41:34.992 --> 41:36.493
I'm sorry.

41:37.728 --> 41:39.128
I'm sorry.

41:56.547 --> 41:59.649
Sepehr:

42:35.886 --> 42:38.588
Behrouz...

42:38.590 --> 42:40.156
Pray with me.

42:40.158 --> 42:41.691
You need a hospital.

43:40.618 --> 43:41.951
No!

43:44.322 --> 43:46.923
No, no, no...

43:48.826 --> 43:50.093
Sepehr?

44:15.886 --> 44:19.889
Man:
<i>Bezy, Bezy, Bezy...</i>

44:34.972 --> 44:39.709
Behrouz, you are a sick man.

44:47.384 --> 44:48.918
Fuck you.

44:56.326 --> 44:57.860
Papa?

45:00.698 --> 45:02.799
Your papa is over here.

45:04.201 --> 45:05.835
Run!

45:13.310 --> 45:15.144
Run!

45:19.950 --> 45:22.418
- Run, Sasha!
<i>- Behrouz!</i>

45:30.027 --> 45:31.728
Sasha:
Bez?

45:31.730 --> 45:33.730
What the fuck's going on?

45:33.732 --> 45:34.964
Behrouz:
Shh!

45:38.168 --> 45:42.371
Farid: Bezy? I know you're
in here somewhere...

45:51.014 --> 45:52.248
Behrouz:
Sasha! Wait.

46:04.194 --> 46:05.962
Behrouz:
Get in!

46:43.066 --> 46:44.333
Behrouz?

46:47.404 --> 46:48.905
Oksana, we...

46:52.410 --> 46:54.010
We have to leave now.

46:54.012 --> 46:56.512
What is he doing here?

46:56.514 --> 46:58.181
What happened to your face?

46:58.183 --> 46:59.382
I'm fine.

46:59.384 --> 47:01.350
Get your stuff.

47:04.988 --> 47:07.590
Are you going to say anything?

47:07.592 --> 47:10.526
Behrouz! Say something!

47:10.528 --> 47:16.032
Sepehr is dead. They're after
Sasha. They're after me.

47:16.034 --> 47:21.370
If we don't leave now, they will
put us in an unmarked grave.

48:10.354 --> 48:11.554
Sasha:
<i>Bez!</i>

48:14.391 --> 48:16.459
They're coming.
Bez, they're coming.

48:20.130 --> 48:21.998
Stay quiet.

48:27.137 --> 48:28.437
Sasha...

51:08.698 --> 51:10.499
Agh!

51:16.306 --> 51:18.107
Come on!

51:18.109 --> 51:19.508
Oksana:
<i>Behrouz!</i>

51:19.510 --> 51:21.444
Behrouz:
<i>Oksana, this way!</i>

51:41.098 --> 51:42.631
Oksana:
Are you alright?

51:52.642 --> 51:54.543
<i>What's going on?</i>

51:54.545 --> 51:56.445
Say something!

51:56.447 --> 51:57.646
Behrouz!

51:57.648 --> 51:59.682
What!? I'm driving!

52:54.204 --> 52:58.374
After they leave,
I went to my dad's room...

52:58.376 --> 53:06.376
And I find this old sweet tin
from Iran filled with...

53:06.684 --> 53:09.818
I kid you not,

53:09.820 --> 53:11.253
opium.

53:13.390 --> 53:17.393
My dad and Behrouz are fucking
o-p buddies.

53:17.395 --> 53:19.495
Holy shit!

53:21.599 --> 53:24.333
I wanna smoke opium!

53:31.575 --> 53:34.276
Go to the room up at the end of
the hall.

53:34.278 --> 53:35.477
Sara:
<i>Behrouz?</i>

53:37.881 --> 53:39.381
Oh my god.

53:39.383 --> 53:42.251
What happened to your face?

53:42.253 --> 53:45.421
I'm fine. There was an accident.

53:45.423 --> 53:47.923
We're gonna spend the night.

53:47.925 --> 53:49.758
I should call papa.

53:59.903 --> 54:01.837
Thank you, Sara.

54:08.712 --> 54:10.613
Fuck you, Behrouz!

54:12.315 --> 54:14.683
Fuck you!

54:14.685 --> 54:18.654
You think my dad is gonna make
you a real estate agent?

54:18.656 --> 54:21.490
He keeps you around because you
remind him of Iran.

54:59.930 --> 55:02.498
I don't know what to say.

55:58.855 --> 56:00.889
Behrouz:
I know how you feel.

56:07.030 --> 56:10.065
I lost many friends in the war.

56:18.975 --> 56:21.110
Are you scared of death?

56:21.112 --> 56:22.511
No.

56:26.983 --> 56:28.484
Bullshit.

56:33.923 --> 56:35.724
They gave this to me

56:35.726 --> 56:38.727
in the war.

56:38.729 --> 56:39.928
It's a key

56:41.564 --> 56:42.998
to paradise.

56:53.943 --> 56:55.911
You believe this crap?

56:55.913 --> 56:58.747
Shit looks like it's
made in China.

56:58.749 --> 57:01.450
What do you believe in?

57:01.452 --> 57:03.452
Nothing.

57:03.454 --> 57:04.720
Nothing?

57:04.722 --> 57:06.054
Nothing.

57:06.056 --> 57:07.556
Man comes from apes.

57:07.558 --> 57:08.991
Apes come from fish.

57:08.993 --> 57:10.692
Fish comes from earth.

57:10.694 --> 57:13.195
Earth comes from nothing.
We all go to nothing.

57:13.197 --> 57:16.565
Nothing. Nothing! Nothing!
- Ok. I get it. Nothing!

57:19.202 --> 57:20.602
You know what?

57:23.106 --> 57:26.608
This... is a key...

57:27.911 --> 57:29.578
To nothing.

58:11.921 --> 58:13.255
Hello.

58:18.561 --> 58:21.630
Cirrus: <i>I was told you
had quite the nightmare</i>

58:21.632 --> 58:24.066
in Sepehr's cafe.

58:26.936 --> 58:28.904
That was our deal.

58:28.906 --> 58:30.739
<i>Our deal?</i>

58:30.741 --> 58:33.509
Already you sound like a "real
estate man".

58:33.511 --> 58:36.178
Bravo, Behrouz-Jan. Bravo.

58:48.291 --> 58:50.759
<i>Behrouz? I raised you better
than this.</i>

58:54.030 --> 58:56.298
<i>Are you a child?</i>

59:04.807 --> 59:06.208
<i>What was he holding?</i>

59:12.582 --> 59:14.082
<i>Good boy.</i>

59:14.084 --> 59:18.020
<i>Now you see the value
plus my interest.</i>

59:18.022 --> 59:19.288
Cirrus-Jan?

59:19.290 --> 59:21.757
<i>You know what to do, Basiji.</i>

59:23.093 --> 59:24.293
Fuck!

59:31.000 --> 59:33.168
Who were you talking to?

59:34.804 --> 59:36.305
Cirrus?

59:40.009 --> 59:41.810
Why were you at Sepehr's?

59:41.812 --> 59:44.012
I was collecting a bet.

59:56.292 --> 59:58.860
How did they do it?

01:00:00.196 --> 01:00:02.664
You don't want to know.

01:00:07.337 --> 01:00:09.771
I was sixteen when I met him.

01:00:11.341 --> 01:00:14.009
He never gave me a choice.

01:00:16.846 --> 01:00:19.381
Do you know what he said

01:00:19.383 --> 01:00:21.850
before he threw me out?

01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:27.889
That I wasn't fit
to be a mother...

01:00:29.392 --> 01:00:32.995
That I wasn't even fit
to be a woman.

01:00:35.665 --> 01:00:37.299
They burnt his eyes

01:00:38.701 --> 01:00:40.736
and they slit his throat.

01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:45.741
Oksana...

01:00:48.044 --> 01:00:50.278
Where would Sepehr hide
his opium?

01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:51.780
What?

01:00:51.782 --> 01:00:53.348
He stole Cirrus Golshiri's opium

01:00:53.350 --> 01:00:56.018
and now they want it back in
exchange for our lives.

01:00:57.320 --> 01:00:58.987
You made this deal?

01:00:58.989 --> 01:01:01.089
There's no deal to make, Oksana.
Where is it?

01:01:01.091 --> 01:01:02.424
How would I know?

01:01:02.426 --> 01:01:04.693
You lived with him.
You stole from him.

01:01:04.695 --> 01:01:06.128
Is that what he told you?

01:01:06.130 --> 01:01:07.663
Sasha:
<i>Hey!</i>

01:01:13.770 --> 01:01:15.003
I know where.

01:02:29.879 --> 01:02:32.147
Danush:
<i>I like to fuck pig.</i>

01:02:32.149 --> 01:02:33.415
Farid:
<i>Say it again.</i>

01:02:33.417 --> 01:02:34.983
I like to fuck pigs.

01:02:34.985 --> 01:02:37.486
There you go.

01:02:37.488 --> 01:02:39.054
What is it mean?

01:02:43.426 --> 01:02:45.026
What is it mean?

01:02:45.028 --> 01:02:46.328
I just told you.

01:02:50.433 --> 01:02:52.400
I like to fuck pigs.

01:03:29.205 --> 01:03:32.007
- Your father and I...
- Get away from me.

01:03:40.817 --> 01:03:42.918
Oksana:

01:04:24.093 --> 01:04:25.460
Behrouz:
<i>Oksana?</i>

01:04:26.863 --> 01:04:28.063
Oksana!

01:04:32.468 --> 01:04:34.469
What does this say?

01:04:42.645 --> 01:04:44.045
Call him.

01:04:44.047 --> 01:04:45.380
No. Why?

01:04:45.382 --> 01:04:46.982
To see if he has the opium.

01:04:46.984 --> 01:04:48.884
So what? Give the
money to Cirrus.

01:04:48.886 --> 01:04:51.052
There should be 250,000.
There's 100,000.

01:04:51.054 --> 01:04:53.622
Sepehr undersold.
Cirrus isn't going to accept.

01:04:53.624 --> 01:04:56.258
- We'll go to Evgeny...
- No, no, no.

01:04:56.260 --> 01:04:58.960
Not with him.

01:04:58.962 --> 01:05:01.563
He's not some child
playing with guns.

01:05:11.340 --> 01:05:13.475
We take the money. We run.

01:05:13.477 --> 01:05:14.976
You, me, Sasha. Let's go.

01:05:14.978 --> 01:05:16.945
Evgeny is your people.
Do something!

01:05:16.947 --> 01:05:18.146
My people?

01:05:18.148 --> 01:05:19.447
Cirrus is your people.

01:05:19.449 --> 01:05:22.284
Your people. My people.
There's no such thing!

01:05:22.286 --> 01:05:24.486
Tell me where he is.
I'll take it to him.

01:05:24.488 --> 01:05:26.621
You don't get it.

01:05:26.623 --> 01:05:29.925
Evgeny is worse than Cirrus.

01:05:29.927 --> 01:05:33.228
He will kill you for the
pleasure of seeing the light

01:05:33.230 --> 01:05:35.597
in your eyes go out.

01:05:41.971 --> 01:05:44.239
We take Sasha and we run.

01:05:45.441 --> 01:05:47.575
And go where?

01:05:47.577 --> 01:05:49.678
You want him to run his
whole life?

01:06:43.599 --> 01:06:45.100
Argh!

01:06:46.303 --> 01:06:47.602
Are you Ok?

01:06:47.604 --> 01:06:49.004
Don't stop!

01:07:01.617 --> 01:07:03.251
Are you ready?

01:07:52.068 --> 01:07:53.334
Oxy-foxy?

01:08:07.483 --> 01:08:09.684
Listen to her Oksana.

01:08:09.686 --> 01:08:12.187
Remember what I told you the
last time?

01:08:12.189 --> 01:08:15.323
Evgeny made a bad deal
with Sepehr.

01:08:15.325 --> 01:08:17.658
A very bad deal, trust me.

01:09:04.473 --> 01:09:07.408
Ok Oxy-foxy. Chill. Ok?

01:09:13.616 --> 01:09:15.850
Woman:

01:09:21.756 --> 01:09:23.691
Svitlana?

01:09:29.564 --> 01:09:33.535
Don't look at Evgeny.
He hates being looked at.

01:09:43.912 --> 01:09:46.514
Woman:

01:09:56.625 --> 01:09:59.494
Man:

01:10:10.873 --> 01:10:13.541
Man/woman:

01:10:15.411 --> 01:10:17.412
Man:

01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:27.855
Ygor. No more cocaine for her.

01:10:27.857 --> 01:10:29.991
She does what she likes.

01:10:29.993 --> 01:10:31.993
I like what she does.

01:10:31.995 --> 01:10:34.362
Woman: I'm just getting started.

01:10:34.364 --> 01:10:38.900
You are one big fucking
cock tease.

01:10:38.902 --> 01:10:42.303
One naughty little bitch, yeah.

01:10:54.283 --> 01:10:56.618
Too hot to Trotsky, ah?

01:10:56.620 --> 01:10:58.486
Ciao, Bella.

01:10:58.488 --> 01:10:59.754
Ciao, Oksana.

01:11:02.024 --> 01:11:03.992
You lived here?

01:11:07.830 --> 01:11:11.432
Evgeny: Life is like
a box of chocolates.

01:11:13.402 --> 01:11:15.870
I only like to
fuck the dark ones.

01:11:18.607 --> 01:11:19.941
Ygor, we have guests.

01:11:19.943 --> 01:11:22.577
Please, some hospitality.

01:11:23.946 --> 01:11:25.413
Cocaine?

01:11:25.415 --> 01:11:26.881
Oksana:
He smokes opium.

01:11:29.852 --> 01:11:31.953
Opium?

01:11:31.955 --> 01:11:35.556
Not another fucking Iraaanian.

01:11:35.558 --> 01:11:38.426
I tell you. No fatwa.
No ayatollah.

01:11:38.428 --> 01:11:42.363
No mother-tongue
bullshit in here. Huh?

01:11:42.365 --> 01:11:44.799
Here we're all Americans!

01:11:44.801 --> 01:11:47.535
Yankee doodle dandee.

01:11:52.574 --> 01:11:54.876
So you're the new chocolate?

01:11:56.378 --> 01:11:57.612
Huh?

01:12:06.555 --> 01:12:10.391
Well, you know how to
look at a man.

01:12:12.928 --> 01:12:14.762
Mm...

01:12:18.034 --> 01:12:21.936
I suppose you think I'm some
kind of faggot?

01:12:21.938 --> 01:12:24.339
Maybe.

01:12:24.341 --> 01:12:26.107
You know how that goes.

01:12:27.710 --> 01:12:31.045
I like pussy.

01:12:31.047 --> 01:12:33.881
I like hot cunt.

01:12:35.918 --> 01:12:40.355
So Oksana, you've come back here
to bite the hand that feeds you?

01:12:40.357 --> 01:12:42.657
Sepehr Shahzad sold you opium

01:12:42.659 --> 01:12:45.626
that he stole
from Cirrus Golshiri.

01:12:55.971 --> 01:12:58.940
You accusing me of stealing?

01:12:58.942 --> 01:13:02.110
No. No. Sepehr stole.

01:13:02.112 --> 01:13:05.513
Then I suggest
Cirrus-go-suck-my-dick

01:13:05.515 --> 01:13:08.783
takes it up with
Sepehr Mujahadeen.

01:13:08.785 --> 01:13:11.519
He did. Sepehr's dead.

01:13:20.596 --> 01:13:22.430
My condolences.

01:13:30.038 --> 01:13:34.842
But you seem to have landed on
your back

01:13:34.844 --> 01:13:36.611
with your legs in the air.

01:13:43.685 --> 01:13:45.787
We return the money
you gave Sepehr.

01:13:45.789 --> 01:13:49.791
You give us the opium.
We give it to Cirrus.

01:13:49.793 --> 01:13:51.092
Fair.

01:13:51.094 --> 01:13:53.494
Not fair.

01:13:53.496 --> 01:13:56.197
I know you, sister.

01:13:56.199 --> 01:13:59.033
I know your games, your tricks.

01:14:01.503 --> 01:14:05.940
Oksana, she has talents and I
put those talents to work.

01:14:05.942 --> 01:14:08.676
Then Sepehr Shahzad comes along
and buys her from me.

01:14:08.678 --> 01:14:11.012
Triples my investment.

01:14:11.014 --> 01:14:13.648
Crazy fucker is in love.

01:14:13.650 --> 01:14:18.853
But he pays cash. Monthly.
Regularly. Dependably.

01:14:21.089 --> 01:14:26.828
But paradise doesn't last
forever, eh, Oksana?

01:14:26.830 --> 01:14:31.833
And now you come here with your
new chocolate...

01:14:34.236 --> 01:14:36.704
and my money

01:14:36.706 --> 01:14:38.539
demanding my drugs.

01:14:40.909 --> 01:14:43.945
You tell me
Sepehr Shahzad is dead.

01:14:46.248 --> 01:14:48.850
It's true! Sepehr is dead!

01:14:51.820 --> 01:14:53.020
Ygor.

01:14:55.724 --> 01:14:57.825
Call the Mujahadeen.

01:15:07.936 --> 01:15:10.705
You Belarusian whore.

01:15:10.707 --> 01:15:12.173
Ah!

01:15:23.785 --> 01:15:24.986
Oksana:
Get off him!

01:15:24.988 --> 01:15:27.088
Get the fuck off him!

01:15:28.991 --> 01:15:31.025
Behrouz:

01:15:36.798 --> 01:15:41.669
Well for an Arab's whore you're
not so docile.

01:15:41.671 --> 01:15:43.938
Must be your Russian blood.

01:15:45.140 --> 01:15:46.641
Agh!

01:15:46.643 --> 01:15:48.009
Put the gun down!

01:15:50.212 --> 01:15:52.079
You fucking bitch!

01:15:53.949 --> 01:15:56.217
Oksana:
<i>In the bag.</i>

01:15:56.219 --> 01:15:58.185
Give her the fucking drugs!

01:15:58.187 --> 01:15:59.587
And the money.

01:15:59.589 --> 01:16:00.788
We don't need the money.

01:16:00.790 --> 01:16:02.256
Give her the fucking money!

01:16:02.258 --> 01:16:03.658
Hurry! Get the door!

01:16:03.660 --> 01:16:05.860
This is gonna be a ride!

01:16:40.295 --> 01:16:42.063
Sasha?

01:16:46.335 --> 01:16:47.902
La-la? La-la!?

01:16:47.904 --> 01:16:49.136
Sasha!

01:16:54.910 --> 01:16:56.644
It's not funny!

01:16:59.014 --> 01:17:00.214
Sasha...

01:17:01.883 --> 01:17:03.084
Sasha!

01:17:07.022 --> 01:17:08.222
Sasha!

01:17:13.997 --> 01:17:15.262
Cirrus?

01:17:21.403 --> 01:17:23.404
<i>And words of wisdom?</i>

01:17:28.276 --> 01:17:29.710
I can't find him.

01:17:31.780 --> 01:17:35.916
Cirrus... we have your opium...
Where is Sasha?

01:17:35.918 --> 01:17:39.220
<i>Ah... look who's talking:
Mary Magdalene.</i>

01:17:39.222 --> 01:17:41.322
<i>Your son has a nice smile.</i>

01:17:41.324 --> 01:17:45.993
Cirrus, please. Sasha had
nothing to do with this.

01:17:45.995 --> 01:17:50.798
<i>There's a place where the desert
meets the forest.</i>

01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:52.800
<i>Behrouz knows it well.</i>

01:17:52.802 --> 01:17:54.402
<i>Sunset.</i>

01:17:54.404 --> 01:17:57.705
Cirrus? Cirrus?

01:18:02.044 --> 01:18:04.011
Sara!? Sara!!

01:18:20.729 --> 01:18:22.229
Come here. Sara?

01:21:47.969 --> 01:21:51.472
Sasha:

01:22:07.555 --> 01:22:09.356
Time to fuck Ali Baba.

01:22:18.934 --> 01:22:24.238
Oksana: After Sasha was born I
wanted to take him to Belarus.

01:22:24.240 --> 01:22:27.074
Sepehr wouldn't let me.

01:22:29.144 --> 01:22:32.179
He took me to a forest
like this.

01:22:33.381 --> 01:22:34.581
He beat me.

01:22:36.418 --> 01:22:39.720
But then he felt guilty so he
drugged me.

01:22:42.090 --> 01:22:44.725
I hallucinated for hours.

01:22:44.727 --> 01:22:50.297
I saw colours and patterns. The
forest was never ending.

01:22:54.336 --> 01:22:57.004
I thought god was punishing me.

01:22:58.473 --> 01:23:00.441
When you're a child,
it's always,

01:23:00.443 --> 01:23:04.111
"do this. Don't do that."

01:23:06.281 --> 01:23:11.185
You think when you grow older
finally you'll have freedom.

01:23:11.187 --> 01:23:16.323
But then you grow up
and nothing changes.

01:23:22.230 --> 01:23:25.366
In America we say
we have freedom.

01:23:25.368 --> 01:23:28.102
I don't know what that is.

01:23:31.406 --> 01:23:33.574
In Iran we had

01:23:35.343 --> 01:23:38.178
paradise to look forward to.

01:23:53.328 --> 01:23:54.661
And now?

01:23:56.464 --> 01:24:00.100
We're gonna take our trip.

01:24:00.102 --> 01:24:03.537
We'll go somewhere green.

01:24:03.539 --> 01:24:06.040
Somewhere where it rains.

01:24:06.042 --> 01:24:07.708
Me, you and Sasha.

01:24:09.444 --> 01:24:14.348
And we're gonna stay inside and
we're gonna be free.

01:25:34.362 --> 01:25:36.563
Uh uh uh.

01:25:36.565 --> 01:25:38.765
Don't you fucking move.

01:25:59.420 --> 01:26:01.922
Where's our Mary Magdalene?

01:26:23.411 --> 01:26:24.611
Farid!

01:26:29.584 --> 01:26:31.418
Farid:

01:26:52.273 --> 01:26:53.707
Check it out.

01:27:34.716 --> 01:27:36.383
What?

01:27:36.385 --> 01:27:39.786
"Did you say your
prayers today?"

01:27:39.788 --> 01:27:40.988
Did you?

01:27:57.272 --> 01:27:58.472
Stay down!

01:27:59.774 --> 01:28:01.875
You're gonna run into the forest

01:28:01.877 --> 01:28:03.277
and you're gonna hide.

01:28:03.279 --> 01:28:04.544
Run! Now!

01:29:17.785 --> 01:29:19.453
Ah!

01:29:38.673 --> 01:29:40.374
Agh!

01:29:42.810 --> 01:29:47.114
This one for breakfast!
This one for dinner!

01:29:51.719 --> 01:29:54.087
What the fuck, you gulag queen?

01:29:55.690 --> 01:29:57.424
Go find your son.

01:30:01.796 --> 01:30:04.698
But I'm the reason
you came to America!

01:30:04.700 --> 01:30:05.966
Evgeny!

01:31:21.642 --> 01:31:22.843
Behrouz?

01:31:24.846 --> 01:31:26.546
<i>Can you see it?</i>

01:31:28.683 --> 01:31:31.785
<i>Can you see your
road to Karbala?</i>

01:31:49.704 --> 01:31:52.539
<i>Did you pray today, Basiji?</i>

01:31:55.042 --> 01:31:56.243
Did you?

01:32:10.258 --> 01:32:11.758
Mum?

01:32:12.994 --> 01:32:14.194
Mum?

01:32:20.101 --> 01:32:23.036
Oksana:
Are you Ok? Are you Ok?

01:32:25.973 --> 01:32:27.607
Sasha:
Behrouz!?

01:32:27.609 --> 01:32:28.942
Oksana:
Sasha! Wait!

01:32:42.657 --> 01:32:44.624
Sasha:
Behrouz!

01:33:04.845 --> 01:33:06.780
Behrouz... No...

01:33:12.587 --> 01:33:13.853
Please...

01:33:15.323 --> 01:33:16.756
Please...

01:33:36.243 --> 01:33:38.345
It's Ok.
