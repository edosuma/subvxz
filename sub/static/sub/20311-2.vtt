00:01.961 --> 00:04.338
[Lucy] "...and that is when
the man approached him."

00:04.338 --> 00:08.676
Great! Thank you, Lucy.
Next up, Step...

00:08.676 --> 00:11.595
Stephan, take your time please.

00:11.595 --> 00:17.643
"When the man a-arrived...

00:17.643 --> 00:22.690
he ask-ed for the moe-ney?"

00:22.690 --> 00:24.358
Money.
He asked for the money.

00:24.358 --> 00:27.528
Yup, a little quicker too okay?

00:29.530 --> 00:33.033
"He said he lik-ed...

00:33.033 --> 00:36.495
lik-ed... like-da..."

00:36.495 --> 00:39.080
-Just liked.
-[Stephan] "Just liked..."

00:39.080 --> 00:42.835
-[whispers] No...
-[Stephan] "everything a...

00:42.835 --> 00:46.338
-...bout the car."
-Okay, good. Keep going.

00:46.338 --> 00:51.010
-"When the man...
-No, Stephan you just read
that line, okay?

00:51.010 --> 00:53.762
Remember what I
said to you, ya gotta
follow with your finger okay?

00:53.762 --> 00:55.389
-Should I keep going?
-No, that was good.

00:55.389 --> 00:57.016
But I wanna finish it.

00:57.016 --> 00:59.018
[Gerry] Uh, but it's someone
else's turn now.

00:59.018 --> 01:00.561
Thank you. Next up.

01:00.561 --> 01:02.980
-Good job, Stephan.
-Thanks, Lucy.

01:02.980 --> 01:06.817
Lucy... seriously? Okay?

01:07.818 --> 01:10.612
Okay, Paul? No, sorry, mistake.

01:12.489 --> 01:14.867
Sha... no...

01:14.867 --> 01:18.579
Sar...no...

01:18.579 --> 01:20.664
Lucy, it's your turn again.

01:20.664 --> 01:23.042
I'm just gonna have Lucy...

01:23.042 --> 01:27.046
She's gonna read
the whole year, okay? All right.

-Jeremy!
-Okay, it's, again, Gerry.

01:45.022 --> 01:47.524
[Janitor] Ah Gerry,
I tells you the weather,

01:47.524 --> 01:50.235
every time the rain come,
I find, and it make me, my back,

01:50.235 --> 01:53.948
I found that guy he put
the moisten on it,

01:53.948 --> 01:55.866
and the day later it pop.
And then I say to my
wife...

01:55.866 --> 01:58.953
Blaftoni Sharmutaya blaftoni!

01:58.953 --> 02:01.329
-I don't know
what you're saying.
-It's tough Gerry.

02:01.329 --> 02:04.374
Every time the money comes out
the other peoples take it away.

02:04.374 --> 02:07.086
-Mr. Cheeley!
-Mr. Duncan.

02:07.086 --> 02:11.548
-Ah, Mr. Malek
-Malik, it's pronounced Malik.

02:11.548 --> 02:13.968
Mr. Malik, remember,
you and I spoke earlier

02:13.968 --> 02:16.136
and you're gonna stay very late
tonight. Do you remember?

02:16.136 --> 02:19.139
We spoke earlier and you're
gonna stay here very
late tonight,

02:19.139 --> 02:22.267
because the last four...
five times you've said

02:22.267 --> 02:25.145
you were gonna stay,
you somehow forgot so we spoke,

02:25.145 --> 02:28.315
he's a witness you're staying
here very late tonight.

02:28.315 --> 02:31.526
Yes, I put the
thought in the place right now.

02:31.526 --> 02:33.862
Great!

02:42.287 --> 02:45.666
I don't like that Mr. Cheeto.

02:49.628 --> 02:51.546
Well thank you for that,
Terrence,

02:51.546 --> 02:53.632
so we're down to one
more item on the agenda.

02:53.632 --> 02:55.968
Actually, I have
something to add to it.

02:55.968 --> 02:58.053
Well, that's a little
unorthodox,

02:58.053 --> 03:00.514
but, but fine, I'll allow it

03:00.514 --> 03:04.476
at the end after the final item
which is everyone's favourite

03:04.476 --> 03:06.061
guidance counsellor, Ms MacPhee,

03:06.061 --> 03:09.564
tells us about
the 24-hour famine.

03:09.564 --> 03:12.317
I don't think
that was unorthodox.

03:12.317 --> 03:14.319
[Eva] Thank you Robert.

03:14.319 --> 03:16.905
[whispers] Wow!

03:16.905 --> 03:22.953
War, famine, poverty,
the environment.

03:22.953 --> 03:25.622
These are issues
that I care deeply about

03:25.622 --> 03:27.791
and you really should too.

03:27.791 --> 03:30.127
I've organized this
24-hour famine

03:30.127 --> 03:32.462
because there are so many
children in the world

03:32.462 --> 03:35.757
who wake up every single morning
with no food to put in their
bellies.

03:35.757 --> 03:37.843
-Trudy...
-What?

03:37.843 --> 03:39.553
-Trudy...
-Trudy.

03:39.553 --> 03:40.888
It's a bagel

03:40.888 --> 03:42.430
Just remember that
some of your students

03:42.430 --> 03:44.516
will have stopped
eating at 7:00am

03:44.516 --> 03:46.393
and they're subsisting
on just water.

03:46.393 --> 03:48.729
They'll be sleeping over
at the school tonight.

03:48.729 --> 03:51.190
And everyone who makes it
through will have a
celebratory breakfast

03:51.190 --> 03:52.941
together tomorrow morning.

03:52.941 --> 03:54.359
And we will have
a vegan option.

03:54.359 --> 03:55.861
Okay, good to know.

03:55.861 --> 03:58.113
I could always use more
help if anyone...

03:58.113 --> 03:59.656
I will help, I'll be there.

03:59.656 --> 04:01.783
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

04:01.783 --> 04:03.202
You said you were coming
to my thing tonight.

04:03.202 --> 04:06.287
-This is way better.
-This is a famine.

04:06.287 --> 04:08.123
-Yeah.
-Simon??

04:08.123 --> 04:10.084
Shh!

04:10.084 --> 04:11.835
[Robert] Thank you Ms. MacPhee.

04:11.835 --> 04:13.921
It does take a lot of work.

04:13.921 --> 04:16.840
I think we should applaud
Ms. MacPhee for her efforts.

04:16.840 --> 04:19.342
Thank you Simon.

04:19.342 --> 04:23.180
I think we should stand
and thank Ms. MacPhee.

04:23.180 --> 04:25.599
Okay.

04:25.599 --> 04:28.643
Lisa's now going to
talk about her night

04:28.643 --> 04:31.396
which is the complete
opposite of the famine.

04:31.396 --> 04:34.983
Thanks Gerry.
Ok, so I just wanted

04:34.983 --> 04:36.818
to remind everyone about
the staff social tonight.

04:36.818 --> 04:38.653
It's gonna be a lot of fun,

04:38.653 --> 04:41.281
so if anyone's free you
should come out

04:41.281 --> 04:42.783
and have some drinks. [laughs]

04:42.783 --> 04:44.492
Will there be lots of food?

04:44.492 --> 04:46.995
Yes, Gerry. There'll be
food there.

04:46.995 --> 04:51.541
So you can, you can
feast or famine.

04:51.541 --> 04:53.627
[laughs]

04:53.627 --> 04:55.295
It's... it's a joke.

04:55.295 --> 04:56.880
[whispers] Oh, my God.

05:00.425 --> 05:02.677
[whispers] Bad joke.

05:02.677 --> 05:07.015
Morning, morning, morning.
Don't cut yourself, Dominic.

05:08.267 --> 05:10.018
-Ooooh, last...
-Mr Duncan.

05:10.018 --> 05:12.187
I thought you were
participating in the famine.

05:12.187 --> 05:14.689
No, I am supervising the famine.

05:14.689 --> 05:17.692
Oh, but you can't
supervise the famine
without participating.

05:17.692 --> 05:19.736
Sends a weird
message to the kids.

05:19.736 --> 05:21.529
And where's that message
displayed, somewhere?

05:21.529 --> 05:24.741
In their minds when they
see you eating and they can't.

05:24.741 --> 05:28.578
-Fine! I will participate
and I will win.
-You don't win a famine,

05:28.578 --> 05:31.748
-you might win a muffin
eating contest.
-Ha-ha.

05:31.748 --> 05:34.084
Plus, I know the
real reason you got involved
with the famine.

05:34.084 --> 05:36.503
No, we both don't.
I do, you don't.

05:36.503 --> 05:39.131
-I know for a fact that
I do know.
-You think you know.

05:39.131 --> 05:40.966
No, I don't think,
I know exactly why.

05:40.966 --> 05:42.801
No, you're guessing. Okay.

05:42.801 --> 05:45.220
On the count of three, we'll
both say at the exact same time

05:45.220 --> 05:47.555
-why I'm doing the famine.
-Promise?

05:47.555 --> 05:50.017
-One, two, three, compassion.
-Give it up.

05:50.017 --> 05:53.020
You have designs
on Ms. McPhee.

05:53.020 --> 05:55.563
-Tell the truth.
-I do not have...

05:55.563 --> 05:58.733
-So what?
-Go on.

05:58.733 --> 06:01.945
have compassion for this okay?

06:01.945 --> 06:03.822
So if you don't mind,
I have a muffin to go eat.

06:03.822 --> 06:06.241
Good, enjoy. Oh, what
about the famine?

06:06.241 --> 06:08.743
I don't recall any muffin
exemptions in this famine.

06:08.743 --> 06:11.288
Look! I haven't eaten
since seven o'clock last night.

06:11.288 --> 06:13.332
Fine, but we both know you're
not going to make it through
the night without eating.

06:13.332 --> 06:14.916
-Wanna bet?
-Great.

06:14.916 --> 06:16.626
If I win I get to be vice
principal for the day.

06:16.626 --> 06:18.170
And if you win you get to
teach my grade five class

06:18.170 --> 06:19.713
for the rest of the year.

06:19.713 --> 06:21.173
That's a demotion.

06:21.173 --> 06:23.466
If I win, you have to
match my pledges

06:23.466 --> 06:24.968
dollar for dollar for dollar.

06:24.968 --> 06:26.928
-Done.
-Fine.

06:26.928 --> 06:29.514
Kids, listen up, please.

06:29.514 --> 06:32.976
Mr. D is no longer doing
a 24-hour famine,

06:32.976 --> 06:35.562
-I'm doing a 36-hour famine.
-Oh, bravo!

06:35.562 --> 06:38.773
and I will begin by
not eating this muffin,

06:38.773 --> 06:42.361
to show you
my commitment to famine.

06:43.862 --> 06:45.322
Thank you!
Lucky shot.

06:45.322 --> 06:47.032
But you still have to
pay for the muffin.

06:47.032 --> 06:49.326
It's wasteful, too.

06:49.326 --> 06:51.828
I hate him,
put a muffin on Mr. D's tab.

06:51.828 --> 06:55.207
-You mean Mr. Dwyer's tab?
-Yeah, Mr. Dwyer,
that's correct.

06:55.207 --> 06:57.376
Thank you.

06:58.919 --> 07:01.713
So, what, I can't
eat a bagel now?

07:01.713 --> 07:03.173
I know, right?
Is she for real?

07:03.173 --> 07:04.258
Hey guys?

07:04.258 --> 07:05.592
I got a table
for 20 tonight,

07:05.592 --> 07:07.261
-do you think that'll be enough?
-Yes.

07:07.261 --> 07:08.762
-Yup, I think that
should do it.
-[Trudy] Oh yeah.

07:08.762 --> 07:10.931
-Yeah, mm-hmm.
-You're still coming right?

07:10.931 --> 07:13.183
You know, this is the
problem, we can't go.

07:13.183 --> 07:15.269
-We have, um...
-Yeah can't happen.

07:15.269 --> 07:18.605
-The, um... There's the...
-We have a spinning class.

07:18.605 --> 07:20.565
-...spinning.
-Wow.

07:20.565 --> 07:23.068
Trudy, there's
two for one drinks.

07:23.068 --> 07:25.404
-Two for one drinks?
-Yeah, two for one.

07:25.404 --> 07:27.447
Here's what I'm thinking, Bobbi,
I'm thinking that we can

07:27.447 --> 07:28.949
-probably miss swimming...
-Spinning.

07:28.949 --> 07:30.409
Spinning,
just this one time.

07:30.409 --> 07:32.827
-And we will be there.
-Okay, friends.

07:32.827 --> 07:35.663
-Okay I'll see ya tonight.
-Okay.

07:35.663 --> 07:37.416
-What is wrong with you?
-What?

07:37.416 --> 07:38.833
You know when you hear
me say spinning,

07:38.833 --> 07:40.168
it means I don't
want to do something.

07:40.168 --> 07:41.795
Yeah, and you know
when you hear me say

07:41.795 --> 07:44.423
two for one drinks, that means
I do want to do something.

07:44.423 --> 07:46.466
[laughs]

07:46.466 --> 07:48.427
[ball bouncing loudly]

07:48.427 --> 07:50.637
Goin' for my record here.

08:03.233 --> 08:05.319
Are You There God?
It's Me, Margaret

08:05.319 --> 08:07.154
What's that all about, Sheila?

08:07.154 --> 08:09.030
It's just a story
about a girl.

08:09.030 --> 08:11.408
Mmm, true story?

08:11.408 --> 08:13.327
Sir, I'd rather
not talk about it.

08:13.327 --> 08:15.536
sir, I can't concentrate
with you talking.

08:15.536 --> 08:18.581
Jonathan, I can't concentrate
when you're in my class.

08:18.581 --> 08:21.835
So we all have things
that ruin our concentration.

08:21.835 --> 08:24.712
Mine is you,
so just keep reading.

08:24.712 --> 08:27.424
Fourteen minutes left to read.

08:27.424 --> 08:29.843
Ah, well I wish you
could come tonight.

08:29.843 --> 08:32.346
Yeah, I wish I could be
in two places at the same time.

08:32.346 --> 08:34.473
Actually there have been
significant advancements

08:34.473 --> 08:37.017
with cloning that suggest
that you could create

08:37.017 --> 08:39.269
two individual people
with a shared personality.

08:39.269 --> 08:43.357
Weird... Well, there will
be lots of people there so...

08:45.275 --> 08:47.444
I don't think Mr. Young likes me

08:47.444 --> 08:50.780
Oh, it's Lee-yung his
parents are Chinese,

08:50.780 --> 08:52.991
-Adopted.
-Oh, my God,

08:52.991 --> 08:54.868
I've been calling him
"Young" this entire time.

08:54.868 --> 08:57.245
That's why he doesn't like me.

08:57.245 --> 09:01.582
When you are in the library,
you shut your mouth.

09:01.582 --> 09:03.835
-Hi, Simon!
-Hey.

09:05.920 --> 09:07.255
Okay, I don't know
if that's why,

09:07.255 --> 09:09.508
but he definitely
doesn't like you.

09:09.508 --> 09:12.010
All right kids,
while you were reading

09:12.010 --> 09:14.012
the last 15 or 16
minutes,

09:14.012 --> 09:15.638
I was surfing the Internet.

09:15.638 --> 09:19.684
Looking up the book
that Sheila is reading.

09:19.684 --> 09:25.648
Because she didn't want
to tell me because the book
is about menstruation.

09:25.648 --> 09:28.235
Visit from Aunt Flo,
the crimson wave.

09:28.235 --> 09:30.362
I know the terms, ladies.

09:30.362 --> 09:33.281
Nothing you can say
will shock me.

09:33.281 --> 09:37.327
It's part of your body.
How many girls in here
have not had their period?

09:37.327 --> 09:39.329
-That's not funny.
-Yes, it is.

09:39.329 --> 09:42.332
It's insensitive.
I apologize, ladies,

09:42.332 --> 09:44.418
for Jonathan's insensitivity.

09:44.418 --> 09:46.378
Girls, none of you have to
ever fear

09:46.378 --> 09:50.048
about telling me
that you've had your period.

09:50.048 --> 09:53.385
You don't have to lie
and be ashamed and hide
books you're reading on it.

09:53.385 --> 09:55.136
I know what you're
going through.

09:55.136 --> 09:57.556
Not personally, obviously.

09:57.556 --> 10:02.227
Interesting fact:
if you're pregnant,
your period stops.

10:02.227 --> 10:06.773
Which is like this
magical thing that just happens.

10:06.773 --> 10:09.192
-[class bell rings]
-Ok, that's it.

10:09.192 --> 10:11.652
-Have a good day.
-[Sheila] So embarrassing.

10:11.652 --> 10:13.738
Oh, by the way ladies,
if you get "that time,"

10:13.738 --> 10:15.865
stay out of the ocean. Sharks!

10:15.865 --> 10:18.452
That's what they're looking for.

10:21.704 --> 10:24.665
-Are you ready to starve?
-What?

10:24.665 --> 10:28.086
-Oh, it was just a joke.
-About starving children?

10:28.086 --> 10:29.837
Yeah, that's never
funny, I guess.

10:29.837 --> 10:33.883
Gerry, over 20,000 people
died from starvation today.

10:33.883 --> 10:36.928
Mmmm, I think I would
have heard about that.

10:38.679 --> 10:42.559
-Oh, no, this is crazy.
-Oh, excuse me, I'm needed.

10:42.559 --> 10:46.146
Look how busy this is,
how are we going to talk?

10:47.855 --> 10:49.690
-Mr. Duncan
-What?

10:49.690 --> 10:52.486
Glad you decided
to join the famine.

10:52.486 --> 10:55.572
-What'd you have for lunch
-today? I'm not eating,
you know that.

10:55.572 --> 10:57.157
Okay? Staying strong.

10:57.157 --> 11:00.535
Fine, I'll be
looking out for you.

11:04.205 --> 11:06.166
Raymond!

11:12.464 --> 11:15.467
Uh, no flips, get out!
I said that already.

11:18.553 --> 11:20.972
Well, Ms. MacPhee, Eva.

11:20.972 --> 11:23.433
I just finished
24 hours of my...

11:23.433 --> 11:25.226
-[Robert] Raymond!
-...36-hour famine.

11:25.226 --> 11:28.062
Wow, I wish more staff
were committed like you Gerry.

11:28.062 --> 11:30.357
Did you know that
90 percent of people

11:30.357 --> 11:32.359
don't passionately care
about anything?

11:32.359 --> 11:35.320
I try to passionately care
about everything.

11:35.320 --> 11:37.696
-Me, too.
-Oh, hey, Simon.

11:37.696 --> 11:39.407
-How's everything going?
-Hello, Simon.

11:39.407 --> 11:42.827
Great, balloon suit is a hit.
Kids seem to really like it.

11:42.827 --> 11:44.078
They get to pop it.

11:44.078 --> 11:46.206
I don't think they really...

11:46.206 --> 11:49.000
...would enjoy that at this age.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.918
I have a game that I think
everyone would love

11:50.918 --> 11:52.462
-Great!
-Ok!

11:52.462 --> 11:54.088
[whistles] Kids!
Come on in here!

11:54.088 --> 11:57.091
Mr. D has a game for you.
You'll love it!

11:57.091 --> 12:01.638
Have a seat, everybody.
Yeah, come on in, Mr. Cheeley!

12:01.638 --> 12:04.723
All right, we're going to play
a get to know each other game.

12:04.723 --> 12:06.560
Great. Community building.

12:06.560 --> 12:08.811
-Namaste.
-No mistakes, I promise.

12:08.811 --> 12:10.855
All right,
Ms. MacPhee will start.

12:10.855 --> 12:13.983
She will say three things
about herself but one
of them is false.

12:13.983 --> 12:17.028
And we have to guess
which one is false.
Okay? You start us off.

12:17.028 --> 12:19.864
Okay, I've been vegan
for 15 years,

12:19.864 --> 12:22.116
I'm a certified yoga
instructor,

12:22.116 --> 12:25.119
and I, um... I have a dog.

12:25.119 --> 12:27.414
Okay, but we know that's not
true because she took too long.

12:27.414 --> 12:30.041
You have to say them
quickly in a row. Watch.

12:30.041 --> 12:33.294
I'm a good singer, I'm a good
dancer, I'm good at all sports
except swimming.

12:33.294 --> 12:35.422
-Is it that you can't sing?
-I'm a great singer.

12:35.422 --> 12:37.298
-You can't dance?
-I'm a good dancer

12:37.298 --> 12:39.008
-So you're not good
at all sports?
-I'm good at all sports,

12:39.008 --> 12:41.636
and I can swim. So it was a
little bit of a cheat there,

12:41.636 --> 12:46.057
but now you know more about me.
See how that works?

12:46.057 --> 12:49.477
Okay, my favorite animal
is a dragon,

12:49.477 --> 12:52.021
my middle name is Frederick

12:52.021 --> 12:54.357
and once in college,

12:54.357 --> 12:57.318
I made out with three girls
at the same time,

12:57.318 --> 13:01.448
-all of our tongues
sort of overlapping...
-No, Simon, you can't say that.

13:01.448 --> 13:03.991
-And the fake one
was the dragon.
-Simon.

13:03.991 --> 13:07.995
Because dragons aren't
animals, they are beasts
of mythology and lore.

13:07.995 --> 13:09.664
Ms. MacPhee, can I
go to the bathroom?

13:09.664 --> 13:12.125
-Yeah, sure.
-Or Mr. D, you can
ask either one of us.

13:12.125 --> 13:17.796
All right? Sheila had to go
because Sheila had a visit
from Aunt Flo.

13:19.132 --> 13:22.051
Oh, sorry,
these are reserved

13:26.847 --> 13:30.602
Oh, thank God you're here!
Have a seat, sit down.

13:30.602 --> 13:35.231
I had to keep ordering drinks
to keep the tables [laughs]

13:35.231 --> 13:37.567
-Oh, I'm so happy you came.
-[Bobbi] Me, too.

13:37.567 --> 13:41.613
Yeah, well we're here now.
Mama needs a drink.

13:41.613 --> 13:44.949
But you also need too...
One track mind.

13:44.949 --> 13:46.909
I kept losing people
to that famine.

13:46.909 --> 13:50.371
-Famines'll do that...
-Yeah.

13:50.371 --> 13:53.667
Oh, ya hear that?
Hear my stomach growl?

13:53.667 --> 13:56.544
[chuckles] Like a tiger.

13:56.544 --> 14:00.006
Hey, you ever tried roasted beet
salad with goat cheese in it?

14:00.006 --> 14:02.049
-Are you kidding me right now?
-[Simon] It's an
unbelievable combination

14:02.049 --> 14:04.636
my mom used to make it the
flavors bring each other...

14:04.636 --> 14:06.137
All I'm thinking
about is food.

14:06.137 --> 14:07.347
I'm starved and
you bring up food.

14:07.347 --> 14:08.556
My head is pounding
I'm dizzy,

14:08.556 --> 14:10.475
I'm going to collapse
in a minute...

14:10.475 --> 14:12.477
I just want a little
time with Eva and you're
talking about food?

14:12.477 --> 14:14.270
-You like Eva?
-I never said I liked Eva,

14:14.270 --> 14:16.481
I said I wanted talk to
her and get to know her.

14:16.481 --> 14:18.483
I could put in a good word
for you with Eva if you want.

14:18.483 --> 14:22.153
Do not put a good word in,
forget I even brought up Eva.

14:22.153 --> 14:24.572
Done. Forgot.

14:24.572 --> 14:29.828
-I'm too hungry for this
-Too hungry for love, Gerry?

14:31.412 --> 14:34.248
-Excuse me, Lori.
-Yeah?

14:34.248 --> 14:36.835
-What is that?
-Lip balm.

14:36.835 --> 14:39.504
Lip balm. I will need
to take that lip balm.

14:39.504 --> 14:42.006
You cannot have lip balm
here at the school.

14:42.006 --> 14:44.091
This looks like...
what flavor is this?

14:44.091 --> 14:46.511
-Cherry.
-Cherry, hmmm.

14:47.887 --> 14:50.931
This is a famine. Okay?
Cherry's a fruit.

14:50.931 --> 14:53.518
-Okay.
-Don't break the rules.

14:53.518 --> 14:55.936
I will take this.
You will get it back.

14:55.936 --> 14:59.023
And so there were these
really cool LA Gear sneakers

14:59.023 --> 15:01.776
that were pink and white and
they had these little diamonds,

15:01.776 --> 15:03.528
like all throughout it,

15:03.528 --> 15:06.614
and I loved those shoes,
and my mom gave them to Goodwill

15:06.614 --> 15:10.284
and then when I was 16, and
I got this driving instructor,

15:10.284 --> 15:12.829
the driving instructor
was wearing the same ones,

15:12.829 --> 15:14.789
and I was, like,
"Where did you get those?"

15:14.789 --> 15:17.625
I wanna get another pair.
They were so awesome.

15:17.625 --> 15:19.293
Hey, Mr. Leung came.

15:19.293 --> 15:21.796
-[Bobbi] And he brought
his son, too.
-Hey, Mr Leung.

15:21.796 --> 15:25.925
I am so glad you guys could
make it and who are you?

15:25.925 --> 15:28.094
This is my boy.

15:28.094 --> 15:32.557
Aw... I just...
It's just so heartwarming

15:32.557 --> 15:36.561
-that you chose to adopt.
-What?

15:38.062 --> 15:40.398
-Oh, God.
-Thank you.

15:40.398 --> 15:42.650
-I am so sorry.
-You just... shush.

15:42.650 --> 15:44.360
Listen, hey, hey,

15:46.153 --> 15:48.364
Me and your mother were
gonna tell you okay?

15:48.364 --> 15:51.701
Talk later, okay?
Some French fries first?

15:51.701 --> 15:55.580
Hey, do not disrespect me
with tears.

15:59.041 --> 16:00.710
[Gerry whispers] Bill, yeah.

16:00.710 --> 16:03.045
I need you to do me
a huge favor.

16:03.045 --> 16:06.132
I'm at this thing at school,
it's all night, it's a famine.

16:06.132 --> 16:10.678
I haven't eaten in 20 hours
or 30, I don't even know
how long it is. Listen!

16:10.678 --> 16:12.680
[Robert] This is a
school not a bar

16:12.680 --> 16:14.766
[Gerry] I need you
to get me some food.

16:14.766 --> 16:19.395
'Cause I'm starving, that's why.
Just get me something.

16:19.395 --> 16:20.980
I'll meet you out front.

16:20.980 --> 16:22.690
[Robert] Put the iPod away,
Raymond.

16:22.690 --> 16:24.651
It's bedtime, okay?

16:30.531 --> 16:34.076
-[horn honking]
-Don't honk the horn, idiot.

16:34.076 --> 16:37.914
[continues honking]

16:37.914 --> 16:40.875
Turn it off, don't!
Don't drive up.

16:40.875 --> 16:42.836
-Don't complain.
-Oh, thanks man!

16:42.836 --> 16:45.087
-I said a sandwich.
-Give it back.

16:45.087 --> 16:47.465
-No, this is fine.
-All right.

16:47.465 --> 16:49.049
-Awesome Man! I owe ya big time.
-Yeah you do.

16:49.049 --> 16:50.510
I gotta take off.
I have a date.

16:50.510 --> 16:53.012
Too hot, man.
Joanna? Who's it with?

16:53.012 --> 16:54.514
-Ah, no.
-Susan?

16:54.514 --> 16:58.184
-It's a girl.
-This is hot!

16:58.184 --> 17:00.269
[sucking air]

17:05.733 --> 17:07.694
No!

17:09.529 --> 17:11.865
Oh, my God! You've
got to be kidding me!

17:13.282 --> 17:14.826
[music, laughter]

17:14.826 --> 17:16.536
How are those fries, Gary?

17:16.536 --> 17:20.498
-Good.
-Yeah Gary, they look
really good.

17:20.498 --> 17:23.250
His name is pronounced Gare-wee.

17:23.250 --> 17:25.336
I just said it.

17:25.336 --> 17:28.006
Okay, all right,
you know what?

17:28.006 --> 17:31.676
I don't know why you don't
like me. But I have had it.

17:31.676 --> 17:35.013
I didn't know that your kids
name was pronounced Gare-wee.

17:35.013 --> 17:38.474
Okay? I am sorry, Mr Leung.

17:38.474 --> 17:41.268
I am here to have fun. Mmm.

17:41.268 --> 17:45.231
I organized this little soiree
to have fun.

17:45.231 --> 17:46.691
And you know what?
That's what I am going to do.

17:46.691 --> 17:49.694
I am going to go dancing
and let this hair down

17:49.694 --> 17:51.487
and I am gonna get down.
So...

17:51.487 --> 17:54.490
[dance music playing]

18:05.626 --> 18:09.422
Trudy! Bobbi! I come for party!

18:09.422 --> 18:11.632
[laughing]

18:13.801 --> 18:16.554
Such moves.

18:19.599 --> 18:22.309
[Lisa laughing] Whoo!

18:22.977 --> 18:24.353
Eat your fries.

18:29.275 --> 18:31.861
-I'd hit that.
-Seriously?

18:31.861 --> 18:33.446
Oh yeah, yesterday.

19:08.022 --> 19:09.732
Let's get her.

19:09.732 --> 19:13.360
-[Bobbi] Hey! Hey, you!
-[Trudy] Aww jeez.

19:13.360 --> 19:16.572
Hey! Hey there! Hey, hey
let go of that, let go of that.

19:16.572 --> 19:18.783
-Come on we're going!
-Hey! Where are you going?

19:18.783 --> 19:21.702
We're going, say goodbye
to your friend, come on.

19:21.702 --> 19:25.039
Okay, I had a
really nice time.

19:25.039 --> 19:27.792
Unbelievable,
Lisa, Lisa, Lisa.

19:27.792 --> 19:30.419
That was so much...
When did you get glasses?

19:30.419 --> 19:33.506
-And your hair is different.
-Come on, hey, hey

19:33.506 --> 19:36.425
-Hey Tootsie roll,
let's wrap it up.
-[Lisa] Ok, I'll go.

19:36.425 --> 19:38.177
She was with me!

19:41.472 --> 19:44.475
[Malik singing]

19:47.687 --> 19:50.940
[continues singing]

19:50.940 --> 19:54.234
Congratulations, everyone!
The famine's over!

19:54.234 --> 19:56.112
[all cheering]

19:57.488 --> 20:00.116
[Simon] Gerry! Gerry!
Where ya been?

20:00.116 --> 20:01.784
I've been looking
all over for ya.

20:01.784 --> 20:04.578
-I fell asleep
-Oh, Jesus.

20:04.578 --> 20:07.915
-What's that on your face?
-Chapstick.

20:07.915 --> 20:09.625
-[Simon] Is it?
-[Gerry] Yeah.

20:09.625 --> 20:11.085
[sniffing] Smells spicy.

20:11.085 --> 20:13.295
Oh, God, Eva can't see that.

20:13.295 --> 20:15.173
-Oh, god! Yeah.
-Smells like hot sauce.

20:15.173 --> 20:19.010
-What are you doing? Gerry?
-Just stand still
for two seconds.

20:19.010 --> 20:21.679
Just shut up for two seconds.

20:23.639 --> 20:25.432
What?

20:27.894 --> 20:31.064
Oh, Simon had some
wings and I had a couple.

20:31.064 --> 20:33.273
-Simon, is that true?
-Not true.

20:33.273 --> 20:36.652
Eating at a famine?
Don't be too disappointed,
Ms. MacPhee.

20:36.652 --> 20:38.487
The good news is, Mr. Duncan,

20:38.487 --> 20:40.114
though he failed at the famine,

20:40.114 --> 20:42.533
will be more than happy
I'm sure to match the pledges

20:42.533 --> 20:44.827
to a tune of 422 dollars.

20:44.827 --> 20:47.496
-How did you raise four...
-Congratulations everyone.

20:47.496 --> 20:51.417
For those of you who
did the famine, a delicious
breakfast awaits.

20:51.417 --> 20:53.293
[cheering]

20:53.293 --> 20:57.506
Eva, I went 32
hours without eating.

20:57.506 --> 21:01.677
Gerry, you ate.
It's just so disappointing.

21:05.848 --> 21:07.725
Tell me about Friday night.
How was it?

21:07.725 --> 21:11.478
-It wasn't that great.
-Wasn't that great? Why?

21:11.478 --> 21:16.150
It just, you know...
didn't turn out
the way I'd hoped.

21:16.150 --> 21:20.320
-What happened?
-Lisa! There you are,
with Gerry.

21:20.320 --> 21:25.201
Oh, Gerrary, you missed a
Friday night with Ms. Lipa.

21:25.201 --> 21:29.288
Drinking, dancing, kissing...

21:29.288 --> 21:31.249
No we, we didn't kiss

21:31.249 --> 21:32.166
I not tell!

21:32.166 --> 21:35.419
What stays in Lisa's night
happened there also.

21:35.419 --> 21:38.047
-Kissing...
-Oh! Gerry,

21:38.047 --> 21:41.968
Just don't tell my
wife about drinking, dancing.

21:41.968 --> 21:44.887
Kissing... Want some?

21:44.887 --> 21:47.848
In case you want to
make out with the janitor later?

21:47.848 --> 21:50.893
♪ Awesome, awesome
awesome, awesome ♪
