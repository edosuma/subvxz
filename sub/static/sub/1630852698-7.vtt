WEBVTT

00:19.060 --> 00:22.522
Jae-jun, are you at your base?
You're not going anywhere, right?

00:22.605 --> 00:23.940
Put on your gas masks!

00:24.024 --> 00:26.776
I'm not going there, Mom. Don't worry.

00:26.860 --> 00:29.779
They said on TV
that all the soldiers are going there.

00:29.863 --> 00:31.114
So you must be going too.

00:31.197 --> 00:33.241
Why would I?
I'm being discharged next week.

00:33.324 --> 00:35.118
When you're about to be discharged,

00:35.201 --> 00:37.245
they don't have you stand guard
or even train.

00:37.328 --> 00:38.455
As if.

00:38.538 --> 00:41.124
Then why was your last leave canceled?

00:41.624 --> 00:43.501
Can you imagine how worried I am?

00:43.585 --> 00:45.211
-You didn't even call--
-Mom.

00:45.295 --> 00:46.588
What?

00:46.671 --> 00:47.797
I have to go.

00:47.881 --> 00:50.258
Did you go somewhere else
instead of coming home?

00:51.509 --> 00:53.178
Where are you going?

00:53.261 --> 00:54.471
To play soccer. Bye, Mom.

00:54.554 --> 00:55.555
Jae-jun!

01:09.569 --> 01:13.281
Why are you playing soccer?
What if you get hurt?

01:17.952 --> 01:21.581
Then what should I do all day long?
I'm bored of playing video games.

01:21.664 --> 01:24.000
All you did was play video games before.

01:30.590 --> 01:31.841
-Status.
-Clear.

01:31.925 --> 01:33.093
-Clear.
-Clear.

01:33.176 --> 01:34.177
Report.

01:35.053 --> 01:37.180
Control, this is Shadow Gamma.

01:37.263 --> 01:39.557
All infected on F1 have been eliminated.

01:39.641 --> 01:41.351
No survivors found within range.

01:42.352 --> 01:43.978
We're moving to the third floor.

01:48.066 --> 01:51.653
I know you're lying.
You're not going to play soccer, are you?

01:51.736 --> 01:53.321
I'm telling you, I am.

02:10.797 --> 02:12.674
Come out. You're safe.

02:12.757 --> 02:14.509
We're saved! Come out.

02:14.592 --> 02:15.552
Hurry.

02:15.635 --> 02:19.347
Walk slowly. Maintain order.
It's safe this way.

02:19.430 --> 02:20.265
Hurry!

02:29.190 --> 02:31.609
Zone three on B2.
Difficulty suppressing the infected.

02:33.236 --> 02:34.696
Okay. Pull out.

03:07.770 --> 03:11.024
Think of me
and don't go anywhere dangerous.

03:11.107 --> 03:11.941
Okay?

03:13.067 --> 03:14.485
I love you, Son.

03:15.820 --> 03:17.447
You know I do, right?

03:17.530 --> 03:18.698
I love you too, Mom.

03:20.033 --> 03:22.619
I'll call you later.
See you when I get discharged.

03:22.702 --> 03:23.786
-Okay?
-Jae-jun.

03:25.163 --> 03:26.331
Get back safely.

03:27.123 --> 03:28.791
Make sure to call me later.

03:28.875 --> 03:30.627
I'll be waiting, okay?

04:28.726 --> 04:29.936
There's hope.

04:30.019 --> 04:33.147
A small number of white blood cells
were detected in the blood.

04:33.856 --> 04:36.693
Even after full transformation,
the white blood cells remained

04:36.776 --> 04:38.945
and were fighting like warriors.

04:39.028 --> 04:41.864
If the body temperature rises,
the white blood cells activate.

04:43.366 --> 04:45.118
Current temperature is 29 degrees Celsius.

04:46.244 --> 04:47.870
In case blood does not flow,

04:47.954 --> 04:51.291
I'll raise the temperature
both internally and externally.

05:32.832 --> 05:34.959
Leave a message if you want.

05:38.296 --> 05:40.173
I don't have anything to say.

05:43.343 --> 05:44.177
You?

05:53.061 --> 05:54.187
We believe you.

05:56.022 --> 05:57.398
You can untie that now.

06:43.111 --> 06:45.488
Why are you doing this?

06:46.239 --> 06:47.657
Because the others are nervous.

06:52.245 --> 06:53.413
Aren't you?

06:54.747 --> 06:55.790
No.

06:57.291 --> 06:58.126
Why not?

06:58.960 --> 06:59.794
Just because.

07:00.461 --> 07:01.504
I'm not.

07:07.593 --> 07:10.138
You know how I said
I wanted to bite you earlier?

07:10.221 --> 07:12.598
It's okay. Don't say things like that.

07:17.895 --> 07:19.772
It felt like I was dreaming.

07:22.066 --> 07:24.402
You gave off such a nice scent.

07:25.403 --> 07:26.654
What kind of scent?

07:30.616 --> 07:31.534
I'm not sure.

07:32.535 --> 07:35.163
It was something
I had never smelled before.

07:38.040 --> 07:40.501
All I could think of was
that I wanted to eat you.

07:42.962 --> 07:44.797
I wanted to bite you.

07:45.798 --> 07:48.176
I kept thinking of biting and eating you.

07:51.888 --> 07:53.639
That was all I could think of.

07:57.852 --> 08:00.771
Then I heard your voice.

08:03.733 --> 08:04.609
Nam-ra.

08:08.988 --> 08:10.615
Your voice woke me up.

08:14.076 --> 08:16.496
You know you never called me
by my name before?

08:16.579 --> 08:18.623
You always call me "Prez."

08:24.420 --> 08:26.506
It was the first time
you called me by my name.

08:36.432 --> 08:37.308
I know.

08:40.394 --> 08:41.646
I was afraid you'd find out

08:43.064 --> 08:44.398
if I called you by your name.

08:45.608 --> 08:46.776
Find out what?

08:49.779 --> 08:50.988
That I like you.

08:57.245 --> 08:58.663
I don't get good grades,

08:59.664 --> 09:02.250
and I hung out with the bullies
in tenth grade.

09:03.417 --> 09:04.961
But you're a model student

09:06.128 --> 09:07.380
and get good grades.

09:12.134 --> 09:13.427
And you're pretty.

09:32.113 --> 09:32.947
Su-hyeok.

09:34.824 --> 09:35.908
I like you.

10:08.691 --> 10:09.817
I'm glad…

10:12.612 --> 10:14.196
I found out before I died.

11:18.761 --> 11:20.638
NIGHT DUTY ROOM

12:06.392 --> 12:07.518
Hello, sir.

12:10.146 --> 12:11.647
Shit. You scared me.

12:13.524 --> 12:14.442
You're…

12:15.025 --> 12:17.236
you're Seon-yeong, right?

12:18.696 --> 12:19.572
It's Eun-ji.

12:19.655 --> 12:21.824
Right. Eun-ji.

12:26.704 --> 12:27.830
Are you all right?

12:28.456 --> 12:29.331
I am.

12:31.834 --> 12:33.335
But I'm starving.

12:35.004 --> 12:36.380
It's driving me crazy.

12:37.006 --> 12:37.882
What?

12:40.009 --> 12:42.011
Hey.

12:58.152 --> 13:00.905
You're not okay, are you?

13:02.239 --> 13:03.574
You were bitten, weren't you?

13:04.617 --> 13:05.493
Yes.

13:06.327 --> 13:07.203
I was.

13:18.380 --> 13:19.340
All right.

13:20.049 --> 13:22.676
God, you must've been very hungry.

13:23.636 --> 13:24.470
Eun-ji.

13:26.305 --> 13:28.557
My God. That must've hurt a lot.

13:29.058 --> 13:29.934
Right?

13:32.061 --> 13:34.146
You should go to the infirmary, then!

13:44.198 --> 13:48.285
Sir, remember what you said
when I told you I was getting bullied?

13:52.456 --> 13:53.833
"Why are you telling me?"

13:54.834 --> 13:56.335
"Go tell your homeroom teacher."

14:00.464 --> 14:02.925
And after the committee, you also said,

14:04.260 --> 14:06.887
"You're an outcast
because you're so dense."

14:09.390 --> 14:10.724
Do I still seem dense?

14:11.725 --> 14:14.395
Okay, I get it. So get out.

14:16.730 --> 14:18.858
Get out. Please.

14:24.196 --> 14:25.072
Stay back.

14:26.282 --> 14:27.283
Stay back.

14:33.122 --> 14:34.081
Get out.

14:35.124 --> 14:36.208
Get out.

15:08.908 --> 15:11.744
-What is it?
-I heard something strange.

15:31.555 --> 15:34.183
What if she's turning?

15:34.266 --> 15:36.936
-I thought hambies didn't turn?
-You scared me.

15:37.019 --> 15:38.103
My bad.

15:40.856 --> 15:42.274
I hear it.

15:44.234 --> 15:45.861
-What?
-What do you hear?

15:49.073 --> 15:51.033
Someone is puking.

16:00.167 --> 16:01.085
It stopped.

16:05.798 --> 16:06.757
What did?

16:08.384 --> 16:09.802
The puking.

16:27.152 --> 16:29.196
Stop that. You're scaring me.

16:31.740 --> 16:32.825
Don't you hear it?

16:32.908 --> 16:35.244
What are you talking about?

16:41.083 --> 16:41.959
What?

16:42.751 --> 16:44.503
-What is it?
-Are you scared?

16:45.212 --> 16:46.171
Stop that.

16:46.672 --> 16:47.881
It's just that

16:48.841 --> 16:50.384
you're breathing the loudest.

17:03.355 --> 17:05.858
I hate this fucking school.

17:09.611 --> 17:10.738
Do you hear something?

17:12.114 --> 17:13.615
All I hear is that zombie.

17:48.484 --> 17:49.693
What?

18:04.875 --> 18:07.503
Let's get out of here.
This place feels weird.

18:08.170 --> 18:09.463
We can't just leave.

18:10.380 --> 18:11.757
There are too many zombies.

18:12.257 --> 18:15.302
We should've gone to the rooftop
when the music was playing earlier.

18:15.385 --> 18:16.720
Damn it.

18:16.804 --> 18:17.638
Music.

18:18.514 --> 18:20.557
That's right. We have music.

18:21.767 --> 18:23.185
Where do we have music?

18:37.741 --> 18:39.034
Fuck.

18:51.421 --> 18:53.882
What the fuck am I supposed to do?

19:02.099 --> 19:03.350
Ah, fuck!

19:05.394 --> 19:07.062
You moron. Fuck.

19:07.938 --> 19:08.939
You scared me.

19:10.357 --> 19:13.152
Hey, come in here.

19:13.235 --> 19:15.237
What are you waiting for? Move your ass!

19:15.737 --> 19:17.781
Hurry up. Get in here.

19:18.740 --> 19:20.033
Get in here.

19:20.117 --> 19:21.410
Come in, you asshole.

19:28.041 --> 19:30.377
-Are you okay?
-What?

19:31.378 --> 19:32.588
Where were you?

19:32.671 --> 19:33.672
Me?

19:34.756 --> 19:36.049
Obviously, you.

19:37.259 --> 19:38.594
What happened to your eye?

19:40.220 --> 19:42.014
What? My eye?

19:43.640 --> 19:46.101
Stop spacing out, asshole.

19:47.019 --> 19:48.770
What are you looking at, moron?

19:49.563 --> 19:52.191
Hey. Listen carefully. You see that car?

19:53.609 --> 19:55.569
-Run to it.
-Why should I?

19:55.652 --> 19:57.946
Just shut up and run if I say so.

19:58.822 --> 20:00.824
You want me to lure the zombies?

20:00.908 --> 20:04.828
You go that way and lure the zombies.

20:04.912 --> 20:06.747
I'll go that way and scream.

20:06.830 --> 20:09.458
Let's run to the snack shop
while the zombies are confused.

20:10.250 --> 20:12.920
-Got that?
-I'll be going away from the snack shop.

20:13.003 --> 20:16.089
That's why you should run like hell
and circle around.

20:16.173 --> 20:17.925
Go. Get going. Run.

20:18.550 --> 20:19.635
I don't want to.

20:19.718 --> 20:21.637
You chickenshit.

20:21.720 --> 20:23.263
Get out. Go.

20:23.347 --> 20:26.308
I'm not a chicken anymore.
I'm not your gopher anymore either.

20:27.392 --> 20:29.519
Hey. What's gotten into you?

20:30.520 --> 20:32.606
Snap out of it, will you?

20:33.106 --> 20:33.982
Look at me.

20:34.483 --> 20:36.026
It's me, asshole.

20:36.902 --> 20:37.819
Me.

20:42.199 --> 20:44.284
Fine. I'll go.

20:44.368 --> 20:45.452
Hurry.

20:47.788 --> 20:48.830
Hurry up. Now.

20:52.334 --> 20:53.252
Come with me.

20:53.335 --> 20:54.169
What?

21:02.469 --> 21:03.553
Quiet.

21:04.638 --> 21:05.764
The zombies will come.

21:08.642 --> 21:09.476
Watch carefully.

21:10.060 --> 21:11.103
Look.

21:12.604 --> 21:14.648
I'm above you now, got that?

21:14.731 --> 21:15.649
Okay.

21:16.233 --> 21:19.111
You moron. You chickenshit.

21:19.194 --> 21:20.654
Beg for your life.

21:24.324 --> 21:25.409
Come on.

21:25.909 --> 21:27.869
"Save me." Go on.

21:27.953 --> 21:31.415
Save me. Please save me.

21:31.498 --> 21:32.541
I don't want to.

21:39.047 --> 21:42.509
Gwi-nam! Help me, you fucking asshole!

21:53.186 --> 21:54.438
Cheong-san.

21:56.398 --> 21:57.983
I'll gouge your eye out.

22:05.699 --> 22:08.285
We'll build a tall barricade here

22:08.368 --> 22:11.538
and lure them in with music.
We'll use the instruments too.

22:12.164 --> 22:14.958
If we leave the door open,
they'll hear the music and come in.

22:15.042 --> 22:17.919
When the hallway clears,
we'll use the back door and go up.

22:18.003 --> 22:19.212
So you're saying we should

22:19.796 --> 22:23.175
stack desks, chairs, and whatnot
in the middle here,

22:24.051 --> 22:27.387
open the door,
and run out through the back door, right?

22:28.805 --> 22:30.640
Not here. A little farther back.

22:30.724 --> 22:32.017
More room on this side.

22:33.018 --> 22:34.227
Why is that?

22:34.311 --> 22:36.772
There aren't many of us,
but there are many zombies.

22:37.522 --> 22:40.776
I see. She sucks at school,
but she's pretty smart.

22:40.859 --> 22:41.943
Hey.

22:42.027 --> 22:43.570
It's a compliment.

22:46.406 --> 22:49.743
Let's give it a shot.
We can think about the rest later.

22:50.786 --> 22:51.745
We have a TV too.

22:52.537 --> 22:54.247
Let's connect it and make it louder.

22:54.331 --> 22:56.416
We have to look for the cord.

22:57.042 --> 22:59.669
-Ji-min, help me look.
-Okay.

22:59.753 --> 23:01.088
-Me too.
-This way, Ji-min.

23:01.171 --> 23:02.798
Let's give it a shot.

23:05.050 --> 23:06.009
Guys.

23:06.093 --> 23:07.469
What should we do first?

23:07.552 --> 23:08.970
Let's untie that.

23:09.054 --> 23:10.889
We should build a frame first.

23:10.972 --> 23:13.725
I'll do the moving.
You guys work on the frame.

23:14.476 --> 23:15.310
It's okay.

23:15.977 --> 23:16.895
Su-hyeok.

23:17.896 --> 23:18.855
Keep it down.

23:18.939 --> 23:21.400
She can never get close
to the others like this.

23:22.025 --> 23:23.485
And no one will approach her.

23:24.486 --> 23:26.154
How do we do this quietly?

23:26.696 --> 23:30.283
-Hatred is contagious.
-Try this one if that's too heavy.

23:30.367 --> 23:31.660
But so is trust.

23:32.244 --> 23:33.286
Which one? That one?

23:33.829 --> 23:35.455
Not that one.

23:35.539 --> 23:36.498
Put it down here.

23:36.581 --> 23:37.749
Right here?

23:37.833 --> 23:38.750
Nam-ra.

23:38.834 --> 23:41.670
One, two, three.

23:51.430 --> 23:53.557
You should've been
the classroom president.

23:58.061 --> 24:01.148
Joon-yeong, I can't find the cable.

24:03.400 --> 24:04.484
Where is it?

24:10.407 --> 24:11.700
Let's help.

24:12.492 --> 24:13.410
Let's go.

24:17.539 --> 24:18.707
Hey, can you lift this?

24:19.916 --> 24:21.251
One, two, three.

24:23.336 --> 24:25.297
What can I do? That hurts.

24:50.238 --> 24:53.325
RESTRICTED AREA

26:36.177 --> 26:38.054
Hey. Keep it down.

26:38.138 --> 26:39.014
Be quiet.

26:46.479 --> 26:47.897
They'll latch on in swarms.

26:47.981 --> 26:50.066
Make sure to stack it right
so it doesn't fall.

26:50.609 --> 26:51.526
Well…

26:52.444 --> 26:54.154
Over there. Fill the empty spot.

27:03.413 --> 27:04.664
Let's tie it there first.

27:06.916 --> 27:08.460
You need to tie them tighter.

27:10.378 --> 27:11.212
More tightly!

27:12.547 --> 27:13.590
On the other side too.

27:21.681 --> 27:22.849
Is there anything bigger?

27:32.651 --> 27:33.777
It's looking great.

27:45.705 --> 27:46.748
It hurts!

27:46.831 --> 27:48.333
It hurts!

27:48.833 --> 27:50.335
Suck it up.

27:51.002 --> 27:52.087
You're a damn senior.

27:52.712 --> 27:54.631
Must seniors endure everything?

27:55.256 --> 27:57.884
I'm enduring not smoking,
but you can't handle that?

27:57.967 --> 28:00.637
-Do you die from not smoking?
-Yes, you do.

28:00.720 --> 28:03.473
I feel like I'm going to fucking die,
so you suck it up too.

28:03.556 --> 28:05.809
We'll take the trail behind the building.

28:06.393 --> 28:08.019
Once we get past the tennis courts,

28:08.103 --> 28:10.689
we can go through the construction site
and go up the mountain.

28:11.356 --> 28:12.691
Can we make it?

28:13.692 --> 28:16.236
-I don't know.
-Fuck.

28:17.362 --> 28:18.279
Min-jae.

28:19.322 --> 28:21.991
If you don't think you can go on,
just drop it and shoot.

28:22.617 --> 28:23.785
Okay.

28:23.868 --> 28:25.203
What about me?

28:27.247 --> 28:29.958
-Let's go.
-Mi-jin, on three.

28:30.542 --> 28:33.795
Ready? One, two, three!

28:33.878 --> 28:34.963
Hold on. Wait.

28:36.214 --> 28:37.340
Wait.

28:38.174 --> 28:39.426
Hold on. Wait.

28:41.511 --> 28:44.514
Hey. Give them the arrows
when they run out, okay?

28:46.349 --> 28:47.350
Let's go.

28:48.059 --> 28:50.186
One, two, three.

28:50.270 --> 28:51.563
Fuck, he's so heavy!

28:54.190 --> 28:55.400
Shit.

29:04.951 --> 29:06.077
Hold on.

29:10.957 --> 29:11.791
Hey. Wait.

29:15.128 --> 29:17.547
Hey. It broke! What now?

29:17.630 --> 29:19.591
-Get back in. Hurry!
-Get inside! Hurry!

29:19.674 --> 29:20.884
-Get back!
-Damn it!

29:20.967 --> 29:21.968
They're coming!

29:22.051 --> 29:25.388
-Oh my God.
-They are coming!

29:33.062 --> 29:35.565
Hey. Just go without me.

29:35.648 --> 29:36.983
Idiot.

29:37.066 --> 29:38.860
You can't take me anyway.

29:40.195 --> 29:42.697
You'll post about it on Facebook
if we leave you behind.

29:42.781 --> 29:43.948
I won't.

29:44.032 --> 29:45.074
I don't trust you.

29:45.158 --> 29:47.160
Hey, stop pretending to be nice.

29:48.244 --> 29:49.829
You killed Ha-lim.

29:52.207 --> 29:55.502
What? You don't care about others.

29:55.585 --> 29:57.045
You're such a dick.

30:00.423 --> 30:02.675
Let's make it again. Stronger this time.

30:03.384 --> 30:04.385
Okay.

30:15.480 --> 30:17.774
What? What the hell do you want from me?

30:19.025 --> 30:21.986
It hurts like crazy.
Do you know how it feels to be dying?

30:22.529 --> 30:23.613
I do.

30:24.364 --> 30:26.449
I feel that way every time I take a test.

30:28.785 --> 30:29.869
But

30:30.620 --> 30:32.956
there's only so much I can take
because you're in pain.

30:33.873 --> 30:35.583
Shut up and stay quiet.

30:38.503 --> 30:40.964
CHEONGSAN CHICKEN

30:48.263 --> 30:49.681
Is that okay? Does it hurt?

30:54.519 --> 30:55.353
Sir.

30:57.063 --> 30:58.273
I think

30:58.815 --> 31:02.485
we should use our mobility
to get out of here first

31:03.111 --> 31:04.737
and send the army for the kids.

31:04.821 --> 31:06.489
I think that's more rational.

31:07.615 --> 31:08.533
Sir?

31:11.452 --> 31:14.205
If we all die,
who will let them know about the laptop--

31:14.289 --> 31:15.707
Ho-seong.

31:15.790 --> 31:16.958
It's Ho-cheol.

31:17.041 --> 31:17.959
Ho-cheol.

31:19.544 --> 31:22.672
Do you know why people run to safety
when there's danger?

31:25.466 --> 31:28.177
It's because others put themselves
in danger for them.

31:28.261 --> 31:31.639
There's no reason for us
to put ourselves in danger for them.

31:32.265 --> 31:33.641
You're so frustrating.

31:34.517 --> 31:36.436
I ought to just…

31:36.519 --> 31:38.897
If you die,
I'll put in a request with the higher-ups

31:38.980 --> 31:41.983
to get a statue of you erected.
One as big as Admiral Yi Sun-sin's.

31:42.066 --> 31:43.359
Okay? Happy now?

31:44.777 --> 31:46.571
Seriously.

31:46.654 --> 31:49.699
If you're scared, you can stay here.

31:49.782 --> 31:52.702
Goodness. Well put.

31:53.369 --> 31:57.624
We'll leave here together now.

31:58.291 --> 32:00.043
We'll go zoom on the motorcycle, okay?

32:01.628 --> 32:02.795
What about Mommy?

32:10.303 --> 32:11.220
Mommy?

32:12.889 --> 32:15.433
Let's come back for her later, okay?

32:19.812 --> 32:22.774
My son is about your age. He's handsome.

32:22.857 --> 32:24.484
I'll introduce him to you later.

32:24.567 --> 32:27.445
I already have a boyfriend.

32:30.448 --> 32:33.326
What did I say to do once we go out?

32:33.910 --> 32:37.413
You said to keep my eyes shut
and hold onto you.

32:37.497 --> 32:39.874
That's right. Good girl. Very good.

32:41.292 --> 32:42.293
Are you ready?

32:43.294 --> 32:44.170
No.

32:46.923 --> 32:48.675
CHEONGSAN CHICKEN

32:51.219 --> 32:52.553
Go faster! Faster!

32:53.054 --> 32:54.514
Speed up! Go faster!

32:54.597 --> 32:56.683
Shut up!
You're drawing them to us, asshole!

32:57.767 --> 32:58.810
Shut up, you idiot!

33:00.395 --> 33:01.854
I said to shut up!

33:03.606 --> 33:04.816
Oh my goodness!

33:10.071 --> 33:12.240
-They're behind us!
-In front of us too, moron!

33:16.327 --> 33:17.704
Turn!

33:19.998 --> 33:21.374
-Where?
-Turn!

33:26.212 --> 33:28.256
-Shit.
-This way, sir. This way.

33:30.216 --> 33:31.634
Watch out! Careful!

33:32.427 --> 33:33.553
Right! Go right!

33:35.138 --> 33:37.682
It's a dead end! Fuck!

33:37.765 --> 33:39.308
-What do we do?
-Wait.

33:39.809 --> 33:41.310
Hey! There's a way!

33:41.394 --> 33:42.895
-There is?
-There is!

33:42.979 --> 33:43.938
Let's go.

33:44.856 --> 33:45.815
What are you doing?

33:48.276 --> 33:51.279
Come this way, assholes! Let's go!

33:59.704 --> 34:01.539
Sir!

34:02.165 --> 34:03.875
Se-bin, we're saved!

34:03.958 --> 34:05.793
Pipe down unless you want more of them.

34:05.877 --> 34:07.462
Help me!

34:07.545 --> 34:08.796
What was that?

34:08.880 --> 34:10.089
-Over here!
-What's that?

34:10.173 --> 34:11.257
Where's it coming from?

34:12.216 --> 34:13.092
Here!

34:13.176 --> 34:14.552
Help me!

34:15.178 --> 34:16.054
Hey!

34:16.137 --> 34:18.056
-Over here!
-What is that?

34:18.139 --> 34:19.015
Hey, you idiot!

34:19.515 --> 34:21.851
-Thank goodness.
-Why's he talking down to us?

34:23.686 --> 34:26.397
-All right. Hang on.
-What took you so long?

34:26.481 --> 34:28.649
-Let's just go. Please?
-What?

34:29.150 --> 34:30.651
Let's just go.

34:30.735 --> 34:31.652
Please help me.

34:31.736 --> 34:33.321
Just go. Let's go.

34:33.905 --> 34:36.741
-Do you have something to drink?
-They're coming.

34:36.824 --> 34:37.700
Where?

34:39.786 --> 34:41.496
No, they're not, asshole.

34:43.122 --> 34:44.373
Can you make it down?

34:44.457 --> 34:46.084
No. I hurt my leg.

34:46.167 --> 34:48.377
-I can't get down.
-I said let's just go.

34:48.461 --> 34:50.630
Let's go. Come on.

34:51.964 --> 34:53.674
What? Why are you getting off?

34:53.758 --> 34:55.259
-What do you plan to do?
-Hey.

34:56.219 --> 34:58.596
Here, take the baby.

34:58.679 --> 34:59.764
Why am I taking it?

34:59.847 --> 35:01.140
Hurry up, sir.

35:01.724 --> 35:03.643
-Hold on.
-What are you doing?

35:03.726 --> 35:04.602
Stay still.

35:05.645 --> 35:06.646
Stay right here.

35:07.146 --> 35:09.357
-Bring the bike close.
-Gosh.

35:09.440 --> 35:10.900
Yes, climb up there.

35:11.609 --> 35:13.361
Bring it close. Hurry.

35:13.444 --> 35:15.363
They're coming. Come on. Hurry.

35:15.446 --> 35:16.739
Screw that.

35:17.907 --> 35:18.866
Ho-cheol!

35:18.950 --> 35:20.409
-What? Where is he going?
-Hey!

35:20.493 --> 35:22.912
-Hey! Ho-cheol!
-Where the hell is he going?

35:22.995 --> 35:25.706
-Hey, Seoul University! Hey!
-Get back here!

35:47.395 --> 35:48.729
I think this is good enough.

35:50.565 --> 35:51.399
Okay.

35:53.025 --> 35:54.193
Aren't you coming over?

35:54.777 --> 35:56.320
Come over. We left a gap.

35:57.488 --> 35:58.656
Let's go.

36:11.752 --> 36:13.004
Come over here.

36:13.713 --> 36:15.423
Someone has to open the door.

36:18.676 --> 36:20.803
Couldn't you use your head
a little better?

36:21.470 --> 36:22.722
It's okay.

36:22.805 --> 36:24.807
-I'll open it and come over.
-Wait.

36:24.891 --> 36:26.142
I'll go with you.

36:26.225 --> 36:28.603
-It's okay.
-It is not okay.

36:30.229 --> 36:31.063
Here.

36:44.243 --> 36:46.495
Something happened
between you and Gwi-nam, right?

36:47.079 --> 36:48.372
He wanted to kill you.

36:52.793 --> 36:53.836
Shit.

36:55.546 --> 36:57.506
I saw him kill the principal.

36:58.633 --> 37:00.927
I said I'd tell the cops,

37:01.010 --> 37:02.178
so he tried to kill me.

37:04.597 --> 37:05.514
Crazy asshole.

37:14.857 --> 37:16.108
Gwi-nam's dead.

37:16.776 --> 37:17.944
Really?

37:18.027 --> 37:18.903
Yes.

37:19.695 --> 37:22.114
He fell from the fourth floor
while we were fighting.

37:25.159 --> 37:27.620
-And I like Nam-ra.
-What?

37:28.579 --> 37:30.248
I've liked Nam-ra for a while.

37:30.331 --> 37:33.793
-The classroom president?
=Be good to On-jo, okay?

37:34.710 --> 37:37.546
Don't treat her like a guy, you moron.

37:39.090 --> 37:41.926
What are you looking at?
I'm going to open the door.

37:43.594 --> 37:45.638
Go. Get over there.

37:46.722 --> 37:47.640
Go.

38:23.384 --> 38:24.343
Damn it!

38:47.366 --> 38:48.284
Oh no.

38:58.377 --> 38:59.211
Fuck!

39:00.004 --> 39:01.881
Dae-su, make some noise!

39:03.132 --> 39:06.469
You zombie bastards!

39:13.225 --> 39:14.393
Again!

39:14.477 --> 39:15.436
God.

39:16.812 --> 39:20.816
Come here, you fucking zombies!

39:40.795 --> 39:41.670
Wu-jin!

39:41.754 --> 39:44.715
We can't go yet! Hang on!

40:41.981 --> 40:43.023
Nam-ra!

40:58.414 --> 41:00.374
It's going to fall!

41:03.544 --> 41:04.795
Fuck.

41:07.298 --> 41:09.550
How much longer? When can we fucking go?

41:11.635 --> 41:14.221
A little more. Hang on!

41:43.250 --> 41:46.420
We need to study him
to create a treatment or a vaccine,

41:46.504 --> 41:49.006
but we don't have
the facilities or the manpower here.

41:49.507 --> 41:51.175
We must take him to the KDCA.

41:54.094 --> 41:57.181
He cannot leave the quarantine zone
for any reason whatsoever.

41:58.307 --> 42:00.226
Recruit scientists and build the facility.

42:00.809 --> 42:03.354
Airlift all the necessary equipment
and medical supplies.

42:05.022 --> 42:08.150
-What's his name?
-He's Staff Sergeant Lee Jae-jun.

42:08.734 --> 42:13.113
He had a week left until his discharge,
but he volunteered for the operation.

42:13.197 --> 42:16.033
Call his parents
and get their consent for research.

42:17.409 --> 42:20.329
We're under martial law,
so we don't need consent.

42:21.497 --> 42:22.915
If you give the go-ahead,

42:23.707 --> 42:26.502
we can begin the experiments
or autopsy right away.

42:27.169 --> 42:28.337
Call his parents.

42:30.256 --> 42:31.715
Even if we're under martial law,

42:31.799 --> 42:34.301
that's our duty
as the military who took in their child.

42:35.344 --> 42:36.303
Yes, sir.

42:50.150 --> 42:51.610
Commander, sir.

42:52.319 --> 42:54.321
There's an assembly member
awaiting testing.

42:54.405 --> 42:55.364
Follow the rules.

42:56.490 --> 42:58.951
It's Park Eun-hee
from the National Defense Committee.

43:00.202 --> 43:01.120
Darn it.

43:10.254 --> 43:11.589
I'm the commander.

43:13.549 --> 43:15.467
It's nice to meet you. I'm--

43:15.551 --> 43:17.469
Even if you are an assembly member,

43:17.553 --> 43:20.055
there won't be any special treatment.

43:20.848 --> 43:22.600
That is what I came to tell you.

43:23.309 --> 43:25.769
Don't harass the people working hard.

43:25.853 --> 43:28.981
I'd appreciate it
if you'd stay quiet and follow the rules.

43:29.523 --> 43:32.568
Fine. I have a favor to ask though.

43:33.110 --> 43:35.112
Please send a chopper
to Hyosan High School.

43:35.696 --> 43:38.032
A firefighter is heading there alone.

43:38.782 --> 43:40.701
Commander. Hey. Wait!

43:41.869 --> 43:43.537
Send a chopper to the school!

43:43.621 --> 43:45.456
We must save the students!

43:48.125 --> 43:50.127
Even wars can't eliminate schools.

43:50.210 --> 43:53.714
Even if we win the war,
we lose if we lose our schools!

44:06.810 --> 44:08.729
How many students have we saved so far?

44:09.688 --> 44:12.066
Zero so far, sir.

44:12.983 --> 44:14.234
We think no one got out

44:14.318 --> 44:16.612
because they were in class.

44:18.489 --> 44:19.782
Are there choppers available?

44:19.865 --> 44:22.159
No, sir.
They've all been sent on missions.

44:26.830 --> 44:30.417
Request a Black Hawk
and have them scan schools in Hyosan.

44:31.960 --> 44:32.795
Yes, sir.

44:33.545 --> 44:36.131
MAP OF HYOSAN

44:47.685 --> 44:49.812
Should we scan Gangha-dong as well?

44:53.524 --> 44:55.275
Isn't that where your mother is?

44:59.405 --> 45:02.408
We can check
once it is selected as a rescue zone.

45:05.327 --> 45:06.161
Yes, sir.

45:22.803 --> 45:25.180
It's clear! We have to go now!

45:31.353 --> 45:32.187
Hurry!

45:36.191 --> 45:37.067
Cheong-san!

45:38.068 --> 45:40.404
-Go!
-You go first!

45:49.455 --> 45:51.457
I think I'm going to shit myself! Go!

45:56.628 --> 45:58.756
-Come on.
-Let's go.

46:22.571 --> 46:23.405
Hurry.

46:30.120 --> 46:30.996
Move.

46:46.470 --> 46:50.140
PROPER EDUCATION BREEDS GOOD CHARACTER!

46:53.644 --> 46:55.145
Alpha is at the rescue zone.

46:55.646 --> 46:58.982
It is impossible to check for survivors
at Cheongmok Middle School.

46:59.691 --> 47:00.692
Alpha lifting.

47:01.193 --> 47:02.277
Going to Hyosan High.

47:13.747 --> 47:14.706
Come on.

48:04.756 --> 48:06.550
Over here!

48:06.633 --> 48:08.260
Here! I'm here!

48:18.562 --> 48:19.605
Open it!

48:21.481 --> 48:22.357
It's locked.

48:23.191 --> 48:24.067
What?

48:24.568 --> 48:25.527
Move.

48:33.035 --> 48:34.620
Wait. Step aside.

48:39.082 --> 48:40.208
Shit.

48:43.462 --> 48:44.546
Is anyone there?

48:45.088 --> 48:46.173
Anyone?

48:46.757 --> 48:49.092
Is anyone there? Anyone?

48:49.885 --> 48:50.761
Open the door!

48:51.511 --> 48:53.555
Nobody's there! Get back.
Hey, brother-in-law.

48:54.848 --> 48:56.266
One, two, three!

48:56.975 --> 48:58.060
One, two, three!

49:03.732 --> 49:05.859
THE ROOFTOP IS OFF LIMITS TO STUDENTS

49:06.526 --> 49:07.444
Shit.

49:12.991 --> 49:13.992
They're coming.

49:14.076 --> 49:15.327
What's coming?

49:21.667 --> 49:22.918
We're outcasts again.

49:23.543 --> 49:24.753
And this is still hell.

49:24.836 --> 49:27.965
I hope everyone dies.
Every single one of them.

49:40.519 --> 49:41.353
Mom.

49:42.396 --> 49:43.355
It's me.

49:44.731 --> 49:46.191
Dad, you're okay too, right?

49:46.817 --> 49:47.985
I'm…

49:50.362 --> 49:51.530
I'm doing okay.

49:54.157 --> 49:54.992
Mom.

49:56.576 --> 49:58.745
But Cheongsan Chicken is still lame.

50:00.205 --> 50:02.791
If it were Cheongsan Air, Cheongsan Auto,

50:02.874 --> 50:04.292
or Cheongsan Group,

50:05.877 --> 50:06.878
it would be fine.

50:08.839 --> 50:10.966
CHEONGSAN CHICKEN

50:11.049 --> 50:16.263
HYOSAN HIGH SCHOOL

50:23.645 --> 50:24.479
They're here.

50:48.211 --> 50:50.630
DOOR WILL OPEN AUTOMATICALLY
IN CASE OF FIRE

50:58.597 --> 50:59.556
Get back!

51:15.530 --> 51:16.573
Throw this over!

51:47.270 --> 51:48.814
Out of my way.

52:02.160 --> 52:04.079
Freeze!

52:04.996 --> 52:06.957
Get down!

52:12.921 --> 52:13.880
Are you okay?

52:17.717 --> 52:19.136
What about your friends?

52:20.303 --> 52:21.513
Isn't there anyone else?

52:26.434 --> 52:27.352
Hold onto it!

52:27.853 --> 52:28.770
Pull it tight!

52:46.872 --> 52:48.790
ONE HEART

57:19.686 --> 57:22.021
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
LOCATIONS, INSTITUTIONS,

57:22.105 --> 57:24.315
AND EVENTS IN THIS SHOW ARE FICTIONAL.
