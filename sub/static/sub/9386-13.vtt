WEBVTT

00:01.502 --> 00:04.796
[Singing] It seems today that all you see

00:04.880 --> 00:08.175
Is violence in movies and sex on TV

00:08.258 --> 00:11.720
But where are those
good old-fashioned values

00:11.887 --> 00:14.473
On which we used to rely?

00:14.890 --> 00:17.643
Lucky there's a family guy

00:18.185 --> 00:21.563
Lucky there's a man who
Positively can do

00:21.688 --> 00:23.148
All the things that make us

00:23.232 --> 00:24.900
Laugh and cry

00:24.983 --> 00:29.696
He's a family guy

00:34.159 --> 00:36.078
MAN: [On TV] On the next episode
of Deadwood.

00:36.912 --> 00:39.206
-Anything yet?
-No, you?

00:39.331 --> 00:40.332
Nope.

00:40.415 --> 00:41.458
MAN: [On TV] Next Deadwood.

00:42.417 --> 00:44.294
Chris, what're you all dressed up for?

00:44.378 --> 00:48.507
These are my back-to-school clothes.
I start high school tomorrow.

00:48.590 --> 00:51.760
Oh, boy. You better watch out
for the Freshman Hunt.

00:51.844 --> 00:55.889
Yeah. That's where seniors hunt down
freshmen and nail them with paddles.

00:55.973 --> 00:59.393
Man, remember how much that was,
beating those freshmen silly?

01:00.269 --> 01:01.353
Oh, yeah.

01:01.436 --> 01:03.355
You're not serious, are you?

01:03.438 --> 01:07.192
Chris, I'm just as serious as I was
when I saw Paul Reiser do standup.

01:07.484 --> 01:11.196
What's the deal with airline food?
I mean, is this stuff bad or what?

01:11.280 --> 01:13.532
Well, that's not nice.
Those chefs work really hard.

01:13.615 --> 01:16.618
And what's with those Starbucks, huh?
They're everywhere.

01:17.160 --> 01:18.829
Lot of people want coffee.

01:18.912 --> 01:22.207
It's supply and demand. It's the
foundation of our entire economy, Paul.

01:22.499 --> 01:26.378
And who do I talk to about
those long lines at the ATM?

01:26.461 --> 01:27.629
That's what I want to know.

01:28.172 --> 01:29.756
Not me, Mr. Reiser.

01:29.840 --> 01:32.384
Someone who has time to fritter away,
but not me.

01:33.427 --> 01:36.597
Peter, what're you doing?
You've been out of work forever.

01:36.680 --> 01:39.600
You promised me you were going out
to look for a job today.

01:39.683 --> 01:42.269
Oh, okay. I'll go look for a job, Lois.

01:42.853 --> 01:45.647
What is this? The latest Redbook.

01:48.942 --> 01:50.194
[Shouting] Is she gone?

01:50.319 --> 01:51.737
Them and their squabbling.

01:51.820 --> 01:54.406
Although I suppose they're not
the first couple to have problems.

01:56.241 --> 01:58.327
-Did you have a nice day?
-It was okay.

01:59.119 --> 02:01.872
You know,
our son got into your closet today.

02:02.831 --> 02:03.874
Okay.

02:03.957 --> 02:07.628
Anything... Anything in there, maybe you
wouldn't have wanted him to see?

02:08.128 --> 02:09.129
No.

02:09.213 --> 02:12.424
Really? You don't have any
dirty pictures in there?

02:12.633 --> 02:13.634
No.

02:14.092 --> 02:16.720
Then how do you explain these?

02:17.179 --> 02:20.766
-So what? So, I have some paintings.
-Is this how you want me to look?

02:20.849 --> 02:22.809
Come on, Karen.
Do you hate your body so much...

02:22.893 --> 02:25.812
you have to reduce every painting of
the female form to pornography?

02:25.896 --> 02:27.940
Don't you do that.
Don't make this my fault.

02:28.023 --> 02:30.275
It is your fault.
I just want to come home and have dinner.

02:30.359 --> 02:33.695
And have my wife say, "Hello, how was
your day?" That's impossible for you.

02:33.820 --> 02:35.030
-You know what this is about?
-What?

02:35.113 --> 02:38.992
This is about your disrespect for me,
this family and everything we stand for.

02:39.076 --> 02:41.328
What do we stand for?
Who are we, the Goracks now?

02:41.411 --> 02:42.955
Suddenly you're Cynthia Gorack.

02:43.038 --> 02:45.207
That's what you want, isn't it?
You want to be Cynthia Gorack.

02:45.290 --> 02:49.211
You know what, at least Cynthia Gorack's
husband cares about her family.

02:49.294 --> 02:51.255
I can't even talk to you
when you're like this.

02:51.380 --> 02:54.508
Okay. It's over now because you say it is.
Way to go, Karen.

02:54.633 --> 02:57.386
You solve all our problems
by just walking away!

02:57.469 --> 02:59.471
And it's so obvious
I don't care about the family.

02:59.555 --> 03:02.224
I just killed a 700-pound tiger
with a stick and a rock!

03:02.307 --> 03:03.725
That doesn't make you a man, Gary.

03:03.809 --> 03:06.603
Here we go.
Here's act two of the performance.

03:06.770 --> 03:09.231
Karen pretends to leave home
for the 20th time.

03:09.314 --> 03:13.151
You know what, Karen. Go!
I'm not going to stop you. Just go!

03:13.235 --> 03:15.863
-Get out! Get the hell out!
-Screw you, Gary!

03:15.946 --> 03:19.449
Yeah, if you did that more often,
maybe I wouldn't need these paintings!

03:19.741 --> 03:21.618
What the hell you looking at?

03:23.287 --> 03:25.789
I say, anybody listen
to Howard Stern this morning?

03:25.873 --> 03:28.959
He had some strippers in the studio.
They sounded hot.

03:29.126 --> 03:32.713
Then he made a joke about a negro.
But Robin laughed, so it was okay.

03:32.796 --> 03:34.298
[Tires screeching]

03:34.923 --> 03:37.259
I think I'm coming down with something.

03:37.384 --> 03:38.552
Chris, relax.

03:38.635 --> 03:42.639
The Freshman Hunt doesn't really exist.
It's just a myth to scare freshmen.

03:42.723 --> 03:45.100
Really? Oh boy, that's a relief.

03:45.184 --> 03:47.227
Now have a good day at school, sweetie.

03:49.104 --> 03:50.147
[Horn blaring]

03:50.230 --> 03:51.899
Freshman!

03:51.982 --> 03:53.150
[Tires screeching]

03:56.820 --> 03:57.821
Help me!

04:01.408 --> 04:02.951
Freshman.

04:08.373 --> 04:10.959
I got you, you freshman.

04:11.043 --> 04:15.422
I'm going to teach you the lesson
that it is not okay to be a freshman.

04:15.506 --> 04:17.841
[No More Mister Nice Guy by Alice Cooper]

04:33.607 --> 04:36.902
All right, Mr. Griffin.
Jobs you think you would be suited for.

04:36.985 --> 04:40.322
Let's see what you wrote.
"Cowboy, astronaut...

04:40.531 --> 04:44.368
"warlock, more powerful astronaut,
beer expert."

04:44.451 --> 04:46.870
Yeah. And I need something
that pays more than my last job as...

04:46.995 --> 04:48.705
Sandy Duncan's glass eye.

04:49.873 --> 04:52.709
PETER: Hey Sandy. Sandy?
SANDY: What?

04:52.793 --> 04:55.712
-What're you buying?
-Some breakfast cereal.

04:55.796 --> 04:58.715
No, don't get that. That's a bad cereal.
Get some of the Boo Berry.

04:59.716 --> 05:02.344
Turns out there's a job opening
at the Pawtucket Brewery.

05:02.427 --> 05:06.056
Wow, that sounds even better than when
I got paid to take part in that study.

05:06.765 --> 05:09.560
The only one who couldn't finish
the puzzle is the fat one.

05:09.726 --> 05:12.938
I'm sorry. I can't see what you're
going for here. Let me look at...

05:13.021 --> 05:15.566
Oh, it's a jar of preserves. Oh.

05:16.483 --> 05:18.902
Yeah, I guess
that's what all the red pieces were.

05:22.072 --> 05:24.157
Hey, Chris, was school any better today?

05:24.241 --> 05:27.035
No, I hate it. I never want to go back!

05:27.119 --> 05:30.747
Oh, come on, it'll get better.
You just have to find your place.

05:30.831 --> 05:33.000
Let's go, Stewie.
Time to change your diaper.

05:33.083 --> 05:35.127
I'm not worried about high school at all.

05:35.210 --> 05:36.253
Worst-case scenario...

05:36.336 --> 05:39.381
I'll carve out a niche as the effeminate
male friend of the popular girls.

05:39.715 --> 05:41.842
Okay, tonight's my OC party.

05:41.967 --> 05:45.804
I got a case of wine coolers,
so we can drink every time Ryan seethes.

05:45.888 --> 05:47.973
-Cool, I'd love to come.
-Me too.

05:48.056 --> 05:49.516
How'd you get the wine coolers?

05:49.600 --> 05:52.352
Oh, it's... I just did some stuff
for a guy in the parking lot.

05:52.436 --> 05:53.937
Does anyone have any Scope?

05:54.146 --> 05:57.357
I don't care what she says.
I'm never going back!

05:57.441 --> 05:59.735
Look, you can't run away
from your problems, Chris.

05:59.818 --> 06:01.195
That's what I tried to do.

06:01.320 --> 06:04.364
I joined the Peace Corps and a day later,
I was two continents away.

06:04.448 --> 06:05.449
-Really?
-Yup.

06:05.616 --> 06:08.368
But 6,000 miles
and all the dope I could smoke...

06:08.452 --> 06:10.412
still couldn't separate me
from my problems.

06:10.746 --> 06:13.665
And this was good dope.
I mean, it was growing everywhere.

06:13.749 --> 06:16.710
Oh, my God.
This one time, we got so baked...

06:16.793 --> 06:19.713
we ended up eating all the food
the World Health Organization...

06:19.796 --> 06:23.342
had airlifted in.
Man, those villagers were so pissed.

06:23.759 --> 06:26.762
They tried to chase us, but let me
just say, thank God for polio.

06:26.845 --> 06:28.305
Anyway, my point is that...

06:29.640 --> 06:33.519
Is Peter here? I want to re-hire him.
My new eye isn't working out.

06:33.602 --> 06:35.270
Hey, Wheat Thins! Take your top off.

06:42.611 --> 06:46.323
[Singing] I like pancakes, I like pancakes
They make me a happy Peter

06:46.406 --> 06:48.325
I am happy, I am happy

06:49.618 --> 06:51.078
Peter, you seem happy this morning.

06:51.161 --> 06:53.288
You bet.
I'm starting my new job at the brewery.

06:53.372 --> 06:56.667
Finally, I'm one of those guys who can't
wait to get to work in the morning.

06:56.750 --> 06:57.876
Like a dairy cow.

06:57.960 --> 06:59.753
[Moaning excitedly]

07:01.713 --> 07:03.298
Oh, yes!

07:03.799 --> 07:05.467
Yes!

07:08.178 --> 07:10.848
Peter, I just found this note
in Chris' room.

07:10.931 --> 07:14.351
-He ran away to join the Peace Corps.
-Oh, my God! Give me that!

07:14.476 --> 07:15.477
No, that.

07:15.936 --> 07:17.271
[Laughing raucously]

07:27.197 --> 07:28.740
I'm bored with it now!

07:28.824 --> 07:31.410
Peter, Chris ran off to South America.

07:31.493 --> 07:33.412
Well, where the hell
would he get an idea like that?

07:33.495 --> 07:36.999
Wait a second. Don't we know someone
who was in the Peace Corps?

07:37.082 --> 07:40.002
Yeah, who was that?
Was that Beau Bridges?

07:40.294 --> 07:42.588
-Do we know Beau Bridges?
-No, we don't.

07:42.671 --> 07:45.507
I am positive we know somebody
who was in the Peace Corps.

07:45.591 --> 07:47.759
Look, it's me, all right.
He got the idea from me.

07:47.843 --> 07:50.429
Brian, what the hell is wrong with you?

07:50.512 --> 07:51.555
I didn't do it on purpose.

07:51.638 --> 07:54.349
And before you fly off the handle,
you may want to think about it.

07:54.433 --> 07:56.643
The kid's obviously confused.
This might be good for him.

07:56.727 --> 07:58.687
People do crazy things
when they're confused.

07:58.770 --> 08:01.064
Like the time my agent
dropped that bomb on me.

08:01.148 --> 08:04.651
-No one in this town will hire you.
-Oh, yeah?

08:20.709 --> 08:23.587
Taxi. Taxi. Taxi!

08:27.132 --> 08:29.426
All right, Chris.
We're approaching your assigned village.

08:29.510 --> 08:31.929
Tell the people to work together
and drink clean water.

08:32.012 --> 08:35.557
And by the way, the word "colored" still
flies down there. So, get your fill.

08:35.766 --> 08:37.100
[Screaming]

08:42.773 --> 08:45.859
Hello, I am Chief Oleki.
Welcome to my village.

08:45.943 --> 08:50.113
Our air is clean. Our food is bountiful
and our water is caffeine-free.

08:50.197 --> 08:53.033
Never had it. Never will.

08:53.242 --> 08:54.868
This is my daughter, Loka.

08:56.745 --> 08:59.665
My son, Hidalgo. And my cousin, Vinny.

08:59.748 --> 09:02.167
Hey, how you doing?
Give me a word, any word at all...

09:02.251 --> 09:03.961
and I'll pronounce it funny for a nickel.

09:05.379 --> 09:06.588
[Phone ringing]

09:07.339 --> 09:09.383
-Hello?
-Hi, Mom.

09:09.508 --> 09:13.220
-Chris, are you all right?
-Chris, buddy, thank God you're okay!

09:13.303 --> 09:15.639
-Hi, Dad.
-Hey, this has been driving me crazy.

09:15.722 --> 09:18.183
-Who was the chick on Remington Steele?
-Hello?

09:18.267 --> 09:20.936
-Stephanie Zimbalist?
-No, Stewie Griffin. Who's this?

09:21.019 --> 09:23.897
-Thank you.
-Chris, what are you doing down there?

09:23.981 --> 09:26.567
Relax, Mom. I'm having a great time.

09:26.650 --> 09:29.570
-You people knocked me off the modem.
-When are you coming home?

09:29.653 --> 09:31.029
How's the food in South America?

09:31.113 --> 09:33.115
Do the women there
have exposed clitterati?

09:33.198 --> 09:36.785
I'll be home in a month, after people
have forgotten I'm a freshman.

09:36.869 --> 09:39.454
Well... Please, just take care
of yourself, honey.

09:39.538 --> 09:41.331
Hey guys. Is everyone on the phone?

09:41.415 --> 09:42.791
-I got to go.
-Something's in the oven.

09:42.875 --> 09:45.169
-I lost a shoe.
-Don't leave me on phone with her!

09:45.252 --> 09:47.796
-Stewie?
-Hey.

09:47.880 --> 09:51.216
-How's school?
-Hi, Stewie.

09:51.300 --> 09:53.719
Listen, I am swamped...

09:53.844 --> 09:56.722
but Mom has kept me up to date
on everything you're doing...

09:56.805 --> 10:00.142
and I think it's just great.
Hanging up now.

10:03.061 --> 10:06.148
Boy, this place sure has changed
since Pawtucket Pat sold it.

10:06.231 --> 10:08.400
So, this is where you'll be working,
Mr. Griffin.

10:08.817 --> 10:12.738
Oh, and I should mention, employees
are welcome to free Pawtucket Ale.

10:12.905 --> 10:15.282
We just ask that you don't drink
during your shift.

10:15.365 --> 10:17.326
-That won't be a problem, sir.
-Great.

10:17.409 --> 10:19.411
I'll be right back with your ID badge.

10:22.539 --> 10:24.750
Mr. Griffin, what happened to your pants?

10:24.833 --> 10:26.376
Oh, look, who's here.

10:26.460 --> 10:29.087
Mr. "I don't have time
for your Little League games."

10:29.254 --> 10:31.173
Come here, you son of a bitch!

10:31.256 --> 10:32.716
[Sobbing]

10:33.091 --> 10:36.595
Why do you close your eyes
when we make love?

10:42.935 --> 10:45.479
I wonder how your father's first day
at work went?

10:46.813 --> 10:47.814
[Horn blowing]

10:48.315 --> 10:51.693
-Dad, what the hell are you doing?
-Yeah, hey, buddy.

10:51.777 --> 10:56.198
I'll have a triple cheeseburger
and a large fries and...

10:56.532 --> 10:57.616
Do you sell pants?

10:59.660 --> 11:01.745
Hey, Meg, what's with all the beer cans?

11:01.828 --> 11:04.915
My dad got a job at the brewery
and he gets lots of free beer.

11:04.998 --> 11:07.251
Actually, he's kind
of been going overboard lately.

11:07.334 --> 11:11.129
-Oh, my God!
-Hey, Meg, you seen my pants?

11:12.631 --> 11:15.467
Lois, by the way,
we're out of toilet paper.

11:15.634 --> 11:16.760
[Snoring]

11:20.889 --> 11:23.725
Chris, thank you for helping bring water
to my village.

11:23.892 --> 11:27.479
-You're a hero.
-No. Lou Gehrig was a hero.

11:27.604 --> 11:30.482
Excellent. As soon as I release
this biological toxin...

11:30.566 --> 11:33.652
into the world's water supply,
I will rule the world.

11:33.819 --> 11:36.530
I'll call it "Lou Gehrig's Disease."

11:36.655 --> 11:39.783
I just have to remember to make sure
this cap is screwed on tight.

11:41.660 --> 11:44.037
Well, I guess the joke's on me.

11:46.331 --> 11:49.585
This is a gift from all of us.
Go ahead, try it on.

11:49.668 --> 11:50.669
Okay.

11:54.173 --> 11:56.758
Oh my, Chris, we can see your genitals.

11:58.594 --> 12:01.096
Just kidding.
Everyone's genitals are hanging out.

12:01.221 --> 12:02.347
Really?

12:03.515 --> 12:06.059
Wow, this is just like Bible camp.

12:06.185 --> 12:09.313
Only I'm not crying and trying
to pretend I'm somewhere else.

12:12.524 --> 12:15.027
Mr. Griffin,
since you can't control your drinking...

12:15.110 --> 12:16.904
you've been demoted to
the shipping department.

12:16.987 --> 12:20.157
-Come on!
-This is your new supervisor, Angela.

12:20.866 --> 12:25.537
Mr. Griffin, we have different rules here.
For starters, no drinking. Period.

12:25.746 --> 12:28.040
We start work at 7:00 a.m. sharp.

12:28.248 --> 12:30.459
This is your co-worker, Opie.

12:30.626 --> 12:34.630
He is a burden of the state,
deemed unfit for mainstream society.

12:34.755 --> 12:36.006
He is your superior.

12:36.173 --> 12:38.050
[Gurgling]

12:40.928 --> 12:41.970
What'd he say?

12:42.054 --> 12:44.223
He said he wants you
to put your finger in his mouth.

12:44.306 --> 12:46.683
If you value your job, I'd do it.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.311
He bit me!

12:49.394 --> 12:53.440
Mr. Griffin, although I may not fully
understand Opie's management style...

12:53.524 --> 12:56.360
he has proven himself
a more competent employee than you.

12:56.443 --> 12:59.905
So, in my absence, you will listen to him.

13:01.782 --> 13:03.242
Come on, guy.

13:06.995 --> 13:10.582
Damn it! This is worse than being
Kevin Federline's magic mirror.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.087
Magic mirror,
how can I look like a douchebag today?

13:15.170 --> 13:18.340
Well, Kevin, I would say, first of all,
don't shave or shower.

13:18.423 --> 13:19.424
Okay, I won't.

13:19.508 --> 13:21.802
-And you just got out of bed, right?
-Yeah.

13:21.885 --> 13:24.763
I would say, just go ahead
and wear that tank top all day.

13:24.930 --> 13:26.098
Okay.

13:26.181 --> 13:29.309
All right, so we covered the hygiene,
no collared shirts.

13:29.726 --> 13:33.105
Oh, and don't forget to walk around with
an undeserved sense of accomplishment.

13:33.188 --> 13:35.148
[Tribal instrumental music]

13:37.109 --> 13:41.071
Chris, the festival of the harvest is
the time of celebration for my people.

13:41.154 --> 13:42.906
-Would you like to dance?
-Sure!

13:42.990 --> 13:45.534
No one's ever asked me to dance before.

13:46.285 --> 13:48.412
[Singing] I wanna jitterbug

13:49.746 --> 13:51.290
Jitterbug

13:52.040 --> 13:55.043
You put the boom-boom into my heart

13:55.127 --> 13:58.589
You send my soul sky high
when your lovin' starts

13:58.672 --> 14:01.049
Jitterbug into my brain

14:01.341 --> 14:04.636
Goes a bang-bang-bang
till my feet do the same

14:04.720 --> 14:07.848
Wake me up before you go-go

14:07.931 --> 14:10.726
Don't leave me hanging on like a yo-yo

14:10.809 --> 14:14.229
Wake me up before you go-go

14:14.438 --> 14:17.733
And take me dancing tonight

14:19.818 --> 14:23.405
This is a joyous occasion.
You've engaged the entire tribe in dance.

14:23.488 --> 14:26.658
According to our customs,
you're now married to my daughter.

14:26.742 --> 14:27.868
I couldn't be happier.

14:27.951 --> 14:32.915
Well, if you're happy then I'm happy,
because after all... What?

14:35.459 --> 14:36.585
My job sucks.

14:36.668 --> 14:39.671
I'm tired of always scrounging around
on the bottom rung of society...

14:40.005 --> 14:41.590
getting kicked around by the Man.

14:41.673 --> 14:44.343
Like when I worked in that lab
with Dr. Bunsen Honeydew.

14:44.510 --> 14:45.761
[Jabbering]

14:48.639 --> 14:49.765
Agreed, Peter.

14:50.974 --> 14:53.060
We got a letter from Chris!

14:53.352 --> 14:57.356
Okay, he says he's doing great,
having a wonderful time.

14:57.481 --> 15:01.568
He met a girl. He got married?

15:02.319 --> 15:04.363
He says he's not coming back.

15:16.917 --> 15:20.212
We'll be landing in South America shortly.
Please buckle your seat belts.

15:20.295 --> 15:23.382
ANNOUNCER: Hey, Brenda,
what've you got for me? Coffee?

15:23.799 --> 15:26.510
Damn, your ass looks hot.
Is this thing on?

15:26.844 --> 15:28.345
I don't care. I want them to hear.

15:28.428 --> 15:30.347
Oh, Chris, my baby.

15:30.430 --> 15:33.183
I told you, Peter. I never should
have let him out of my stomach.

15:33.267 --> 15:34.977
I can't believe Chris got married.

15:35.269 --> 15:37.187
This is bigger news than
when I toured Europe...

15:37.271 --> 15:39.481
with that musical rendition
of My Left Foot.

15:39.690 --> 15:41.692
[Singing] My left foot

15:41.775 --> 15:44.903
Always been better than
the right one

15:47.739 --> 15:49.825
My left foot

15:49.908 --> 15:53.412
Always gets me where I need to go

15:59.042 --> 16:00.627
I'll start out easy.

16:03.380 --> 16:04.673
Little more complex.

16:15.100 --> 16:19.104
-Oh, Chris, my baby!
-Hi, Mom and Dad.

16:19.771 --> 16:23.192
Everybody, this is my wife, Loka.
We're married.

16:23.275 --> 16:24.276
[Snickering]

16:24.401 --> 16:28.864
Well, maybe here, but not in America,
where God pays attention.

16:28.947 --> 16:31.283
Now, get your things together.
We're leaving right now.

16:31.366 --> 16:34.995
Mom, I'm not going anywhere.
I'm happy here.

16:35.078 --> 16:36.205
This is my home.

16:36.288 --> 16:39.625
You guys got an ATM?
I only got $37 on me.

16:42.669 --> 16:43.754
What's the matter with them?

16:43.837 --> 16:45.839
We've never seen
that much money before.

16:45.923 --> 16:49.676
-You are richest man in the country.
-Richest man in the country?

16:49.801 --> 16:53.680
Wow, no Griffin's been this powerful
since my ancestor King Arthur Griffin.

16:54.181 --> 16:57.601
Arthur, if you are able to draw
the sword from the stone...

16:57.684 --> 17:00.854
and prove to me you truly are
the sole king of Camelot...

17:00.979 --> 17:03.941
I will make love to you right here
in the clearing.

17:04.024 --> 17:06.109
What if I can just move it an inch,
will you touch me?

17:09.363 --> 17:12.866
This is amazing. You've got the biggest
hut in the village and all these servants

17:13.033 --> 17:14.451
and you've only spent $1.50.

17:14.576 --> 17:16.453
That's a hell of a lot less than I had
to spend...

17:16.578 --> 17:19.289
to go see that piece-of-crap remake
of Bewitched.

17:19.540 --> 17:23.043
-Guess what? I'm a witch.
-Guess what? I'm a Clippers fan.

17:25.504 --> 17:26.839
[Stewie exclaiming]

17:47.025 --> 17:51.071
ANNOUNCER: All ticketed passengers
for Flight 2378 to Reno, Nevada...

18:13.552 --> 18:15.137
[Shop bell ringing]

18:28.734 --> 18:30.360
[Doorbell ringing]

18:32.154 --> 18:34.531
-Hello.
-That's not funny!

18:37.201 --> 18:40.120
Peter, this is ridiculous.
We came here to take Chris home.

18:40.204 --> 18:41.413
Why are we staying?

18:41.496 --> 18:43.665
Because I'm tired of being treated
like crap at work.

18:43.749 --> 18:46.585
Don't you see what this means to me?
I'm somebody here.

18:46.752 --> 18:50.214
Finally, a white man has an opportunity
to be rich and in charge.

18:50.464 --> 18:52.883
Hey, Pesci, here's a nickel.
Say Yugoslavia.

18:52.966 --> 18:54.384
Yugoslavia.

18:55.761 --> 18:57.429
Here's a dime. Kill Pesci.

18:57.721 --> 19:00.349
The native man
is an impressive physical specimen.

19:00.432 --> 19:04.061
Look closely at his sinewy muscular form
and unusual vitality.

19:04.394 --> 19:06.271
It is a thrill to watch him dig a ditch

19:06.355 --> 19:09.316
or lift a jug of water
or participate in a hunt.

19:09.399 --> 19:11.068
Cut. Print. Gay.

19:14.363 --> 19:15.489
What's going on?

19:15.572 --> 19:19.117
Peter paid the villagers to reenact
the "Contest" episode of Seinfeld.

19:19.284 --> 19:20.744
-I am out.
-Huh?

19:20.911 --> 19:23.539
I am out. I have pleasured myself.

19:23.705 --> 19:25.123
[Singing]

19:27.918 --> 19:31.713
Dad, I've had enough of you
taking advantage of these people.

19:31.922 --> 19:35.425
For God's sake, the woman playing Elaine
is a high priestess.

19:35.551 --> 19:38.262
You can't spare one square?

19:38.762 --> 19:42.140
I don't have to take that from you.
I'm the richest guy in town.

19:42.933 --> 19:45.644
Dad, don't you see?
This is a wonderful place...

19:45.727 --> 19:48.856
and you're just using it to escape
from your problems at home.

19:48.939 --> 19:50.232
What do you mean? Meg's right there.

19:50.315 --> 19:53.110
But Chris, honey,
aren't you doing the same thing?

19:53.193 --> 19:54.194
What do you mean?

19:54.278 --> 19:57.656
I mean, you just came here because
you were being picked on at school.

19:57.781 --> 20:00.534
You're using these people
to escape your problems.

20:00.617 --> 20:02.536
Oh, my God. You're right.

20:02.619 --> 20:06.290
I married this 11-year-old girl
for all the wrong reasons.

20:06.456 --> 20:07.791
I'm sorry, Loka.

20:07.875 --> 20:11.503
I guess I just came here because
I was afraid of being a freshman.

20:11.670 --> 20:12.671
Freshman?

20:13.046 --> 20:15.591
Freshman!

20:18.844 --> 20:22.139
I guess you can't run away
from your problems anywhere.

20:37.404 --> 20:40.490
Jock! Start the engine! Get the plane up!

21:09.061 --> 21:10.729
Peter, I think we forgot Meg.
