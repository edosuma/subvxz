I'm very disappointed, Ben,

17:55.509 --> 17:58.381
but I give you a lot of credit
for owning up to it.

17:58.425 --> 18:00.166

No. No, you're not good.

18:12.830 --> 18:15.485
Do you understand how hard
I worked just to get here

-Thanks, Bert.

19:18.809 --> 19:19.767
Don't mention it.

19:19.810 --> 19:22.422
And, as a feminist myself,

19:22.465 --> 19:24.206
I think it's great.

19:24.250 --> 19:25.425
Especially in these times.

what's going on
in your head, okay?

Maybe you're scared,
or maybe you're angry,

is that if hit that stage,

you will regret it
for the rest of your life.

lying is just sort of
a part of life,

for us to remember
