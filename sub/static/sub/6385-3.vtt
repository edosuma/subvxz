00:02.840 --> 00:04.512
I am right in the middle of a nasty divorce.

00:04.560 --> 00:06.630
You can play hard to get all you like, Runkle.

00:06.680 --> 00:08.955
But Sue Collini always gets the wienie.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.639
- How's it going, Professor?
- In a word? Awesome.

00:12.680 --> 00:14.796
Look, Hank.
I know you're not exactly

00:14.840 --> 00:17.752
what anyone would call
an education professional.

00:17.800 --> 00:19.552
But my wife went out on a limb for you.

00:21.520 --> 00:24.193
- What do you think of Jackie?
- You're old enough to be her father.

00:24.240 --> 00:25.673
You find me irresistible.

00:25.720 --> 00:27.836
Has a woman ever punched you in the face?

00:27.880 --> 00:29.996
- You know what? You should use me.
- Really?

00:30.040 --> 00:32.554
- This is where you work?
- You want to come inside?

00:32.600 --> 00:35.194
- Would that involve seeing you naked?
- Oh, most definitely.

00:35.240 --> 00:37.754
I think not. In the interest
of student-teacher relations.

00:37.800 --> 00:40.268
We're being all normal
and responsible, and...

00:40.320 --> 00:43.278
What if, in the process,
we just kinda get over each other?

00:43.320 --> 00:46.915
What if you tell me about our daughter?

00:46.960 --> 00:48.916
- Who are you texting?
- Chelsea.

00:48.960 --> 00:51.633
To tell her you're being
a total dick right now.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.877
I fucking hate you!

00:54.920 --> 00:58.515
Yeah, and I fuckin' hate you too,
you little shit.

Oh, no, no, no. You don't have to do that.

01:29.280 --> 01:31.316
Not on my account.

01:31.360 --> 01:34.079
Well, you see,
that is a prime example

01:34.120 --> 01:36.111
of what's wrong with
the younger generation today.

01:36.160 --> 01:38.151
You leave nothing to the imagination.

01:38.200 --> 01:40.236
So you've got yourself some boobs.

01:42.640 --> 01:45.029
Some nice, big, round boobs.

01:46.560 --> 01:48.357
Everybody's got 'em.

01:48.400 --> 01:50.311
You know, nothing to get excited about.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.672
You know, just...

02:04.000 --> 02:08.118
Hank? Hank.

02:09.520 --> 02:11.988
Hank.

02:12.040 --> 02:14.679
- Hank Moody.
- Yes, <i>Fraulein.</i>

02:14.720 --> 02:18.110
- Do you have anything you'd care to add?
- On the subject of?

02:18.160 --> 02:20.594
On the subject of the subject
we were just discussing.

02:20.640 --> 02:23.757
Oh, that subject. Let me think.

02:25.440 --> 02:27.351
Not a thing. Nope.

02:27.400 --> 02:30.472
- No. There is something I would like to say.
- Excellent. We're all ears.

02:30.520 --> 02:33.193
Do we think the ladies have gone too far
with the sex-positive feminism?

02:33.240 --> 02:36.198
I know they all say they're down
with the pornography

02:36.240 --> 02:38.959
and the shaved pudenda and whatnot,

02:39.000 --> 02:41.434
but do we really think
this is the path to liberation?

02:41.480 --> 02:43.516
Ezra Pound. What do you think?

02:43.560 --> 02:47.314
I'm not sure this is the proper forum
for such a discussion, Hank.

02:47.360 --> 02:49.749
You asked me.
I'm just thinking out loud. Spitball.

02:49.800 --> 02:52.394
- OK, everyone. Thanks for coming.
- Already?

02:52.440 --> 02:54.158
- My Lord.
- Yeah, see you all tonight.

02:54.200 --> 02:56.111
You too, Hank. Correct?

02:56.160 --> 02:58.628
- I'm sorry?
- Tonight. My house.

02:58.680 --> 03:01.399
English department fall mixer.
Ring any bells?

03:01.440 --> 03:03.476
- Not a one.
- Oh, it's just a little get-together

03:03.520 --> 03:05.829
we have at the start of every school year.

03:05.880 --> 03:09.509
Faculty, grad students,
some wine, some cheese.

03:09.560 --> 03:11.710
Well, that sounds awesome
and I'm stoked,

03:11.760 --> 03:14.228
but alas, I've got plans
with the soul-sucking vampire

03:14.280 --> 03:16.748
I call my daughter tonight,
so I gotta take a rain check.

03:16.800 --> 03:20.031
Well, no, Chelsea's already asked
if Becca can spend the night.

03:20.080 --> 03:23.436
But I think she'll change her plans when
she hears what her old man's got on tap.

03:23.480 --> 03:26.278
Besides, wine gives me a headache
and cheese makes me fart, a lot.

03:26.320 --> 03:29.915
- You don't want me stinking up the place.
- Now, what if I said...

03:29.960 --> 03:32.713
your job depends on it, Hank?

03:35.440 --> 03:37.556
Are you sexually harassing me right now?

03:37.600 --> 03:41.388
Because if you are,
I think I'm gonna have to report you.

03:41.440 --> 03:44.273
For giving me a serious boner.

03:44.320 --> 03:46.993
Good to know. See you at seven.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.275
No means no, you know.

04:34.800 --> 04:36.631
This man is ruining my life.

04:36.680 --> 04:38.955
By making it unbearably awesome.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.993
Sweetie, I'm not really sure
I understand what the problem is.

04:43.040 --> 04:46.476
He's delusional. He thinks we're going
to hang out and bond or something.

04:46.520 --> 04:47.953
OK, hand it over.

04:48.760 --> 04:52.389
Thank you.
You don't understand, woman. I have a plan.

04:52.440 --> 04:54.510
- You do?
- Yes. If we never leave the house,

04:54.560 --> 04:56.551
nothing bad can ever happen.

04:56.600 --> 04:58.795
Right, cos, like,
your parents never fuck you up.

04:58.840 --> 05:01.593
No, you see, you were supposed
to find that last remark charming.

05:01.640 --> 05:03.676
Hold...

05:03.720 --> 05:06.632
Hello? This thing on?

05:06.680 --> 05:11.231
Yeah, yeah. Hey, I'm here, I just...
My boss is trying to get through.

05:11.280 --> 05:13.999
I'm late for a dinner
with him and some clients, so...

05:14.040 --> 05:15.712
Well, don't go. Just blow it off.

05:15.760 --> 05:18.035
Please, will you take care
of the Becca thing, please?

05:18.080 --> 05:21.197
- Yes. I will take care of it.
- Bye. Bye.

05:21.240 --> 05:24.073
- Becca!
- Yes, Father?

05:24.120 --> 05:26.873
Don your best frock.
The wine and cheese awaits.

05:31.520 --> 05:33.670
You see that bathroom over yonder?

05:33.720 --> 05:39.033
Once, I took every crooked inch
Jackie Gleason had to offer in that stall.

05:39.080 --> 05:41.992
Signed Kristofferson
right here in this booth.

05:42.040 --> 05:47.194
Yeah, time there was
when I would get wet off a great sign.

05:47.240 --> 05:51.392
Oh, that's right. I'm talking dripping,
fucking Ganges wet.

05:52.720 --> 05:54.676
Speaking of the good old days...

05:54.720 --> 05:56.870
- Hey, yeah. Sue Collini?
- Over there, sir.

05:56.920 --> 05:59.798
Hey, Springfield.
Get your toned tush over here.

05:59.840 --> 06:01.512
Sorry I'm late.

06:01.560 --> 06:04.438
Some Tarzana housewife
paid a grand to spend the day with me.

06:04.480 --> 06:06.516
She wanted to make out, so I did her a solid

06:06.560 --> 06:09.279
and I ate that butterscotch
for, like, 45 minutes straight.

06:09.320 --> 06:13.199
Right, Rick. This is my subordinate
and prospective boytoy,

06:13.240 --> 06:15.037
- Charles W Runkle.
- Pleasure.

06:15.080 --> 06:17.389
Sue and I used to see each other, you know.
Early '80s.

06:17.440 --> 06:20.876
Rick, in what universe
is fucking like chinchillas

06:20.920 --> 06:24.708
and blowing coke up each other's asses
"seeing each other"?

06:24.760 --> 06:29.117
I'm a big fan of your oeuvre, Rick.
All of it. The music, the acting...

06:29.160 --> 06:33.392
I'm flattered. Like I said on the phone,
I mean, I'm not looking for representation.

06:33.440 --> 06:37.194
Oh, bullshit.
Housewives in Tarzana?

06:37.240 --> 06:40.357
Rick, don't tell me that you don't wanna
rawdog the top shelf

06:40.400 --> 06:42.277
like you used to in your prime, huh?

06:42.320 --> 06:45.278
All due respect, Sue,
life isn't just about the pussy.

06:45.320 --> 06:47.993
It's about finding your passion
and never letting go,

06:48.040 --> 06:51.430
- and this man has done just that.
- Quit licking his shaft.

06:51.480 --> 06:55.598
He's always been a prime cut
of USDA beefcake, and he knows it.

06:55.640 --> 06:58.757
Sure, the ladies love him.
September 7, 2002.

06:58.800 --> 07:01.837
The best sex I ever had with my wife.

07:01.880 --> 07:04.155
Rick Springfield
at the Universal Amphitheatre.

07:04.200 --> 07:06.760
Was like three solid hours
of foreplay, dude.

07:06.800 --> 07:10.031
Everything she wanted to do with him
in 1982 but didn't know how,

07:10.080 --> 07:13.038
she did with me repeatedly,
and I thank you, sir.

07:13.080 --> 07:15.640
- Fat lot of good that does me.
- OK, Runkle, get to the point.

07:15.680 --> 07:17.511
First, we get you some indie cred.

07:17.560 --> 07:20.677
Let's find you your <i>Wrestler,</i>
like Mickey Rourke.

07:20.720 --> 07:24.235
Let's see you blow people away
with your serious side, huh?

07:24.280 --> 07:28.319
Get an Oscar nom for playing an addict,
a cripple, a retard, whatever.

07:28.360 --> 07:31.875
Then you go into every office in town
and you hit 'em with your passion project.

07:31.920 --> 07:33.672
That's how you get it done.

07:33.720 --> 07:36.712
Harry Greenberg Agency actually
has the mojo to make that happen?

07:36.760 --> 07:41.959
Fuck, no. You supply the mojo.
We take care of everything else.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.992
Yeah, I like the sound of that.

07:45.040 --> 07:47.679
Church.

07:48.640 --> 07:51.916
You're scaring me, Sue.
Does that mean you like that?

08:10.760 --> 08:15.072
Finally. God, what took you so long?
What up, Hank?

08:15.120 --> 08:17.429
Becca, this is your last chance
to change your mind.

08:17.480 --> 08:20.392
- Just do me one favour.
- Anything, my churlish love.

08:20.440 --> 08:23.716
- Try not to get too hammered.
- Don't put Daddy in a corner.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.959
You don't wanna park there.
Dean hates it when you block the entrance.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.197
- Big date tonight?
- Is it that obvious?

08:32.240 --> 08:34.879
That dress could cure cancer!

08:36.280 --> 08:37.918
I think you should fuck him.

08:37.960 --> 08:41.236
If he agreed to meet you
at this sad assembly of two-bit intellectuals,

08:41.280 --> 08:42.793
he clearly digs the shit out of you.

08:42.840 --> 08:45.832
Wow, you have the ability
to make a simple cocktail party

08:45.880 --> 08:48.110
into the worst thing
that's ever happened to you.

08:48.160 --> 08:50.196
- It's a gift, really.
- There you are.

08:50.240 --> 08:53.357
- Did you two come together?
- No. We just came in together.

08:53.400 --> 08:56.472
- Oh, I see.
- And I get more bars outside. Excuse me.

08:57.120 --> 08:59.554
Did you happen to see where
Becca and Chelsea got off to?

08:59.600 --> 09:01.636
They went straight to Chelsea's room.

09:01.680 --> 09:05.116
Come in, come in.
I have so many people I want you to meet.

09:09.560 --> 09:12.074
Come on, baby. Celebrate with me.

09:12.120 --> 09:15.999
Don't baby me, jackass. No.
Fuck no. I got a date.

09:16.040 --> 09:17.871
Well, drop the zero
and get with the hero.

09:17.920 --> 09:20.832
- I signed a big fish today.
- Oh, well, good for you.

09:20.880 --> 09:22.757
Maybe you can move the fuck out now.

09:22.800 --> 09:25.872
Right. Well. Force of habit, I guess.

09:25.920 --> 09:30.755
Every time I sign a client, I just can't help but
picture the two of us with a bottle of bubbly.

09:30.800 --> 09:32.358
Well, that was then, Charlie.

09:33.480 --> 09:35.994
And this is now. Got it.

09:36.040 --> 09:38.190
OK, well...

09:38.240 --> 09:39.912
Have a nice date.

09:39.960 --> 09:42.235
Yeah, thanks.

09:49.440 --> 09:53.911
Runkle, you were on fire today.
I mean, that was serious Swifty Lazar shit.

09:54.640 --> 09:58.394
I've never been so proud and so wet...

09:58.440 --> 10:00.476
at the same time.

10:00.520 --> 10:02.511
Come on.

10:08.400 --> 10:10.595
Thank you.

10:11.480 --> 10:15.268
How many jobs do you have, lady?
You got a paper route too?

10:15.320 --> 10:17.709
Fill this thing up. Scotch preferably.

10:17.760 --> 10:20.877
I'm coming off a lengthy conversation
with a man in a sweater vest.

10:20.920 --> 10:23.115
Dean Koons keeps the good stuff
locked in his office.

10:23.160 --> 10:25.958
- Which would be where, exactly?
- I can't tell you that.

10:26.000 --> 10:30.073
People like you mess with the master's shit,
people like me get blamed for it.

10:30.120 --> 10:33.271
- Class warrior, are we?
- Just a girl saving for a rainy day.

10:33.320 --> 10:36.551
You know, the truth is
I'm a pretty shitty bartender.

10:36.600 --> 10:41.116
But I am a kick-ass stripper.
This bod is the true gift that God gave me.

10:41.160 --> 10:43.310
I agree, but I think
you're selling yourself short.

10:43.360 --> 10:46.716
- What, I'm too smart to be a stripper?
- Smart has nothing to do with it.

10:46.760 --> 10:48.591
I'm just thinking in practical terms.

10:48.640 --> 10:50.756
Down the road, job opportunities
tend to dwindle

10:50.800 --> 10:54.475
for those in the more naked professions,
if you understand what I'm saying.

10:54.520 --> 10:57.512
Two empty glasses, Jackie, thank you.
I'm going to offer

10:57.560 --> 11:00.518
our visiting scholar from Amherst
some of my '82 Latour.

11:00.560 --> 11:02.710
Hey. That's not cool, Dean Koons.

11:02.760 --> 11:04.671
Segregating your guests into two classes,

11:04.720 --> 11:06.836
offering your good stuff
only to a select few.

11:06.880 --> 11:10.190
Well, when you get your Guggenheim,
we can talk about that.

11:10.240 --> 11:12.913
In the meantime, you enjoy
that glass of very middling Cab.

11:12.960 --> 11:13.949
Asshole.

11:20.240 --> 11:24.119
There you are.
I see you found the toys in the attic.

11:24.160 --> 11:27.072
What, are you running a museum
here on the side or something?

11:27.120 --> 11:30.829
It's just his little hobby.
Bores the shit out of me, actually.

11:30.880 --> 11:32.916
I'm quite relieved to catch you here alone.

11:32.960 --> 11:36.350
- You don't care about the snooping?
- Snoop all you want.

11:36.400 --> 11:38.994
My life's an open book. Sadly.

11:39.040 --> 11:41.713
Besides, Becca must have
told you all about us by now.

11:41.760 --> 11:43.591
No, she's not much one for chatting.

11:43.640 --> 11:46.473
Texting, yes. Twitting,
tweetering, twatting,

11:46.520 --> 11:48.158
staring sullenly at the old man.

11:48.200 --> 11:51.112
Oh, please. You fathers have it easy.

11:51.160 --> 11:53.594
Most days, I can barely get
a civil word out of Chelsea.

11:53.640 --> 11:57.599
At least Becca still talks about you
with some sort of twisted affection.

11:57.640 --> 12:00.518
Rebecca? My Becca?
That doesn't sound like her.

12:00.560 --> 12:03.074
No, it's true. We had an interesting
discussion the other day

12:03.120 --> 12:05.350
about the more scatological
elements in your work.

12:05.400 --> 12:08.233
- And she knows a lot about Rabelais.
- Yes, I taught her that shit.

12:08.280 --> 12:12.068
I figured, when she told me all about
how you got your start in New York

12:12.120 --> 12:14.031
- and how you met her mother.
- No shit.

12:14.080 --> 12:16.036
I mean, she seems a little confused

12:16.080 --> 12:18.913
about the issue of whether
you two are still together or not.

12:20.120 --> 12:21.633
Aren't we all?

12:21.680 --> 12:25.195
Oh, that's a shame.
Gosh, I'd love to fix you up sometime.

12:25.240 --> 12:28.073
I appreciate that, but that's a fool's errand.

12:28.120 --> 12:31.157
- Really? Why is that?
- Well, it's my purgatory, really.

12:31.200 --> 12:34.158
Dinner, drinks, whatever.
Never really all that interested,

12:34.200 --> 12:37.317
but I find myself telling her
how beautiful she is anyway.

12:37.360 --> 12:40.670
Cos it's true. All women are,
in one way or another.

12:40.720 --> 12:43.393
You know, there's always something
about every damn one of you.

12:43.440 --> 12:46.876
There's a smile, a curve, a secret.

12:46.920 --> 12:49.480
You ladies really are
the most amazing creatures.

12:49.520 --> 12:53.798
My life's work.
But then there's the morning after.

12:53.840 --> 12:56.877
The hangover, and the realisation
that I'm not quite as available

12:56.920 --> 13:00.549
as I thought I was the night before.
And then she's gone,

13:00.600 --> 13:03.398
and I'm haunted
by yet another road not taken.

13:05.040 --> 13:07.508
Wow. I'm impressed.

13:07.560 --> 13:11.109
You actually dropped the act for a moment
and said something real.

13:11.160 --> 13:13.276
I do that sometimes.
But you never know when it's coming.

13:13.320 --> 13:15.788
You gotta stay on your toes.
I'm like a boxer that bobs and weaves,

13:15.840 --> 13:18.070
like Muhammad Ali or Joe Frazier
or Sugar Ray Leonard.

13:18.120 --> 13:20.588
Basically, I'm just listing boxers, you might...

13:28.240 --> 13:30.515
The party's downstairs, isn't it?

13:35.720 --> 13:38.518
I think you might be
selling yourself a little short.

13:38.560 --> 13:41.358
With just the tiniest bit of effort,

13:41.400 --> 13:44.517
you could've had someone much younger

13:44.560 --> 13:46.437
and much hotter.

13:46.480 --> 13:49.711
But better luck next time, Teach.

13:58.240 --> 14:00.435
What's the matter with you?
You look flushed.

14:00.480 --> 14:02.471
Well, my virtue was just assailed.

14:02.520 --> 14:05.557
In a not entirely
unpleasant manner, but still.

14:05.600 --> 14:08.068
- Leaving so soon?
- Yeah.

14:08.120 --> 14:10.873
Girl can only take so much
humiliation in one night.

14:10.920 --> 14:12.956
The gentleman caller never called, huh?

14:13.000 --> 14:15.309
No, he never called. And he never texted.

14:15.360 --> 14:17.157
And he made an actual plan
to meet me here.

14:17.200 --> 14:19.668
And he seemed really into it
on the first two dates.

14:19.720 --> 14:23.474
And then, he just never showed.
What... Go ahead and explain that to me.

14:23.520 --> 14:27.069
Take a shot, you said
you would explain it and, and... Why?

14:27.120 --> 14:28.917
It's, like, so hard to make a phone call?

14:28.960 --> 14:31.235
You seem to forget I'm not the man
who stood you up.

14:33.240 --> 14:35.390
Here's where he keeps the good stuff.

14:36.760 --> 14:39.797
Me! We were talking about me here.

14:39.840 --> 14:44.960
OK. I'm gonna say this once
and one time only, so listen closely, OK?

14:45.000 --> 14:46.479
Fuck the fireman.

14:46.520 --> 14:50.149
If I recall, that was the same advice
you gave me earlier in the evening.

14:50.200 --> 14:51.553
Totally different context.

14:51.600 --> 14:54.672
So that's it. Just fuck him. That's all you got.

14:54.720 --> 14:57.917
I gotta be laid-back about this.
I'm not even allowed to be pissed off.

14:57.960 --> 14:59.791
No, you get to be pissed off.

14:59.840 --> 15:02.798
But, you know,
maybe if you just relaxed for...

15:02.840 --> 15:07.436
whoa... half a second, and stopped looking
so hard for the appropriate life mate,

15:07.480 --> 15:09.994
then you might wake up
one morning next to one.

15:10.040 --> 15:12.235
Right. Cos it's just that easy.

15:12.280 --> 15:15.238
I didn't say it was easy. But you've got
a serious gam up in the matter.

15:15.280 --> 15:18.317
Oh, yeah. How so?

15:18.360 --> 15:21.193
Cos you're scary smart
and you're crazy beautiful.

15:21.240 --> 15:24.516
You're also incredibly sexual. So there.

15:25.560 --> 15:28.677
What the fuck are you talking about?
I'm a total nerd.

15:28.720 --> 15:30.551
True that, but you're a sexy nerd.

15:30.600 --> 15:32.989
Some women,
they just shut off that part of themselves

15:33.040 --> 15:34.712
and expect Prince Charming to come along

15:34.760 --> 15:37.718
and pry open their dusty old beavers
with the jaws of life, or some shit.

15:37.760 --> 15:39.557
Not you. You're a good-timer.

15:41.240 --> 15:44.835
And you're just saying this, right?

15:45.600 --> 15:48.034
Which... What do you mean?

15:48.080 --> 15:50.594
Well, you're saying all this incredibly weird

15:50.640 --> 15:52.915
but incredibly sweet stuff about me and...

15:52.960 --> 15:55.110
But that's what you do, right?

15:55.160 --> 15:58.311
That's what you do in this situation,
you're trying to make me feel better.

15:59.200 --> 16:02.351
- Yeah. Which is bad, why?
- It's not necessarily a bad thing.

16:02.400 --> 16:06.552
I just wonder if you mean anything
that's coming out of your mouth.

16:06.600 --> 16:09.068
I don't just say shit.
I mean, I do talk a lot of shit,

16:09.120 --> 16:11.998
but I generally mean what I say
and I say what I mean.

16:14.720 --> 16:16.870
So you see me as a viable candidate?

16:18.840 --> 16:23.118
- Depends on what you're running for.
- Dick! You know what I mean.

16:23.160 --> 16:28.234
Look, if my love life weren't as
complicated as something that is...

16:28.280 --> 16:30.350
really complicated
that I can't think of now,

16:30.400 --> 16:32.595
I'd totally check your teeth
and take you out for a ride.

16:32.640 --> 16:34.676
God, I hate you!

16:34.720 --> 16:37.075
What? You're a strange bird.
Why are you hating on me?

16:38.400 --> 16:41.153
Cos I really thought you were
gonna kiss me just then.

16:41.200 --> 16:43.794
That is weird. That is very weird.

16:43.840 --> 16:47.230
- Why?
- Cos I was thinking the exact same thing.

16:47.280 --> 16:48.759
- Really?
- Well, not exactly.

16:48.800 --> 16:52.031
I was thinking about what it might be like
to go down on you for the first time.

16:52.080 --> 16:55.311
- It's kind of the same thing, isn't it?
- You're such an asshole.

17:13.280 --> 17:15.555
Do you feel it yet?

17:15.599 --> 17:18.797
Nope. Is that normal?

17:18.839 --> 17:22.719
Totally.
Mushrooms take a while to hit.

17:24.560 --> 17:26.949
What's the craziest thing
you've ever done?

17:28.480 --> 17:30.596
Sexually.

17:30.640 --> 17:32.756
Let's put it this way.

17:32.800 --> 17:36.156
My father would be thrilled
by my lack of experience in the area.

17:38.080 --> 17:40.355
What about blow jobs?

17:41.640 --> 17:43.278
I touched one.

17:43.320 --> 17:45.231
Kind of freaked me out how hard it got.

17:46.640 --> 17:47.993
You?

17:48.040 --> 17:50.554
A bunch of times. It's fun.

17:50.600 --> 17:53.433
Weren't you scared?

17:53.480 --> 17:58.156
Sure. At first. But then you realise
how much power you have over guys,

17:58.200 --> 18:00.509
and it's kind of exciting.

18:00.560 --> 18:02.676
I'm sure I'd do something wrong.

18:02.720 --> 18:04.790
It's not like you're gonna break it.

18:04.840 --> 18:07.400
I mean, as long as
you're careful with your teeth

18:07.440 --> 18:10.910
and remember to incorporate the balls,
you can't fuck it up too bad.

18:10.960 --> 18:12.871
Ask any guy, he'll tell you.

18:12.920 --> 18:15.992
- OK. Good to know.
- Don't worry.

18:16.040 --> 18:19.749
- We'll get you laid this year.
- No rush.

18:19.800 --> 18:23.031
Sometimes I think I'd be happy
to stay a virgin forever.

18:24.040 --> 18:26.031
Seems like once you get laid...

18:26.080 --> 18:28.992
Your whole life basically turns to shit.

18:29.040 --> 18:32.157
I've heard that one before.
Come on, Becca. You're slipping.

18:32.200 --> 18:36.352
I've done a lot of work to get you out
of that gloomy fuckin' head of yours.

18:36.400 --> 18:38.391
Think about it.

18:38.440 --> 18:41.512
If my mother and father hadn't been
so quick to fuck each other,

18:41.560 --> 18:44.028
I wouldn't be here right now.

18:44.080 --> 18:47.356
And if I wasn't here right now,
I think they'd be a lot happier.

18:47.400 --> 18:49.868
Especially my father.

18:49.920 --> 18:53.913
It's really shitty that he makes you
feel that way, Becca.

18:53.960 --> 18:56.554
He doesn't. It's me.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.956
I just see things.

19:05.240 --> 19:08.198
- Is this it?
- Yep.

19:13.760 --> 19:17.196
- Oh, wow.
- I know, right?

19:17.240 --> 19:18.798
- No, not that.
- No?

19:18.840 --> 19:21.149
No. I'm such a slut.

19:21.200 --> 19:23.839
In the best way possible.

19:23.880 --> 19:26.314
You're not, like, gonna lose
respect for me now, are you?

19:26.360 --> 19:28.590
Eight per cent at the most.

19:28.640 --> 19:30.631
Hold on. Thought I heard somebody.

19:30.680 --> 19:33.717
- Shit. No... Ah!
- Shit.

19:33.760 --> 19:35.193
Go, go.

19:35.240 --> 19:38.710
Won't you treat me nice?

19:38.760 --> 19:43.993
Hey, my peach, blow on my dice

19:44.040 --> 19:46.395
Gonna swing on my swing

19:46.440 --> 19:49.193
Don't you dare treat me nice

19:49.240 --> 19:51.879
Cos I'm a child for you

19:51.920 --> 19:56.038
Baby, I'm wild for you

20:03.720 --> 20:05.631
- OK, you caught me.
- Oh, Jesus!

20:05.680 --> 20:07.557
Watch that stuff. Here, let me take that.

20:07.600 --> 20:09.397
- Gimme that.
- No, no! Will you stop it?

20:09.440 --> 20:11.510
- Moody, for Christ's sake.
- You were gonna spill it.

20:11.560 --> 20:14.358
Please don't handle me.
What are you doing in my private office?

20:14.400 --> 20:17.597
- Came in here to make a phone call.
- That was your cell phone?

20:17.640 --> 20:19.676
Yeah. I like me a '70s groove.

20:19.720 --> 20:22.518
What about that ditty you were singing
when you came in here?

20:22.560 --> 20:26.269
- May I enquire about that?
- That was an obscure classic.

20:26.320 --> 20:27.833
- Was it? Yeah.
- Yes.

20:27.880 --> 20:30.553
Is it some ditty of your own invention,
perhaps?

20:30.600 --> 20:33.160
No, it's right out of
the great American songbook.

20:33.200 --> 20:35.589
If you had a little more culture,
you'd understand.

20:35.640 --> 20:38.598
Something you would have sung
<i>a cappella</i> with the Whiff 'N' Poofs?

20:38.640 --> 20:41.108
Gay Men's Health Choir,
or something like that?

20:41.160 --> 20:44.232
- Hey, you two. Party's in there.
- Ah, yeah.

20:44.280 --> 20:47.078
- You're not having any of my Lowland malt.
- I wouldn't dream of it.

20:47.120 --> 20:49.236
But I would like some privacy
to make a phone call.

20:49.280 --> 20:50.315
- No.
- No?

20:50.360 --> 20:51.952
- No.
- What do you mean, no?

20:52.000 --> 20:55.310
- That's not very polite.
- Well, my house, my rules.

20:59.560 --> 21:01.630
What's gotten into him?

21:01.680 --> 21:04.274
- Is there another way in here?
- Why do you want more privacy?

21:04.320 --> 21:06.072
- Well, I just...
- Listen, Hank.

21:06.120 --> 21:08.953
About earlier,
can we just forget what happened?

21:09.000 --> 21:12.276
Well, we needn't ever speak of it again.

21:12.320 --> 21:15.869
But one does not very easily
forget the kiss of a beautiful woman.

21:15.920 --> 21:18.957
That's right. I said it. I meant it.
And I'm here to represent it.

21:19.840 --> 21:23.116
I gotta run, cos that cheese
is working on me.

21:33.400 --> 21:37.871
Hi. I was looking for Charlie.

21:37.920 --> 21:42.038
- He's gone home for the day.
- You must be Sue.

21:42.080 --> 21:44.355
Yes. Sue Collini.

21:44.400 --> 21:46.311
Marcy, the ex.

21:46.360 --> 21:49.079
He's told me all about you.

21:52.280 --> 21:55.909
OK, well, if you just tell him
that I was looking for him,

21:55.960 --> 21:58.679
I was gonna give him this bottle of...

22:01.320 --> 22:04.630
Smoker's cough.
Love those More Menthols.

22:06.080 --> 22:07.877
Charlie.

22:07.920 --> 22:10.434
- Charlie Runkle.
- Yes.

22:10.480 --> 22:12.471
Are you inside that woman?

22:12.520 --> 22:15.159
- I can explain.
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

22:15.200 --> 22:17.668
Marcy. Marcy, it...

22:18.560 --> 22:22.633
- It was nice to meet you, Sue.
- Marcy, Marcy, don't go. Marcy!

22:22.680 --> 22:24.398
Oh, God, OK.

22:24.440 --> 22:28.319
Let's just keep my ass
closer to the ground, please.

22:28.360 --> 22:30.032
- There you go.
- OK.

22:30.080 --> 22:33.356
Remind me to never take your advice again.

22:33.400 --> 22:35.789
You're gonna thank me
when you're living in the suburbs

22:35.840 --> 22:39.116
with that house with the attached garage
of your dreams.

22:40.480 --> 22:42.436
Would you like a smoke?

22:42.480 --> 22:46.234
No, I've broken quite enough rules
for one night, thank you.

22:46.280 --> 22:49.909
Speaking of which,
probably wasn't cool of me

22:49.960 --> 22:53.236
to take advantage of you
in your moment of weakness.

22:53.280 --> 22:58.195
No, it wasn't. But in fairness, all of my
moments are moments of weakness now.

22:59.880 --> 23:02.348
So, what's the matter with me anyway?

23:04.080 --> 23:07.038
Well, now that I've had
an up close and personal view,

23:07.080 --> 23:09.719
I would have to say, nothing.

23:09.760 --> 23:11.990
Oh, come on, that old chestnut?

23:12.040 --> 23:15.430
It's not me, I just haven't
found the right guy?

23:15.480 --> 23:17.038
- Oh, my God.
- What?

23:17.080 --> 23:19.071
- Shit, he's here.
- Him who?

23:19.120 --> 23:22.590
- The fire dude.
- The balls on that guy, three hours late.

23:22.640 --> 23:25.359
Then again, you just had another dude
inside you ten minutes ago.

23:25.400 --> 23:27.709
- Jill.
- Hey, Ross.

23:27.760 --> 23:29.352
- Hey.
- You made it.

23:29.400 --> 23:32.551
- Yeah, you must really hate me right now.
- She does.

23:33.920 --> 23:37.469
Yeah. That's not a lie. I...

23:37.520 --> 23:38.919
This is...

23:38.960 --> 23:42.191
This is Dr Henry Moody.
I'm her thesis advisor.

23:42.240 --> 23:44.879
It's nice to meet you. I was beginning
to think Jill made you up,

23:44.920 --> 23:46.956
that you were a figment of her imagination.

23:47.000 --> 23:51.357
Well, I'm hoping you'll give me a chance
to explain, you know, unless I'm too late.

23:51.400 --> 23:53.356
Maybe I've missed my chance.

23:53.400 --> 23:56.676
Well, normally she's a real stickler
for verities and balderdash,

23:56.720 --> 23:59.632
but if you were out saving lives,
I think an exception can be made

23:59.680 --> 24:02.194
for a real-life fire dude, don't you think?

24:02.240 --> 24:04.834
Weren't you just saying
you want another fucking drink?

24:04.880 --> 24:06.359
- Yes.
- Just now. You were, right?

24:06.400 --> 24:09.631
- I was. I need another fucking drink.
- Yeah.

24:09.680 --> 24:13.798
And spring for the good stuff.
Top shelf. Don't be cheap.

24:13.840 --> 24:16.115
See you in class, Professor.

24:17.920 --> 24:19.876
There's my dad.

24:19.920 --> 24:22.115
Hey. What have you two been up to?

24:22.160 --> 24:24.355
Late-night swim, midnight tennis match?

24:24.400 --> 24:27.836
We just walked down
to campus to get some pizza.

24:27.880 --> 24:31.031
- Pizza?
- Yes, pizza.

24:32.560 --> 24:35.393
- Come closer.
- Why?

24:35.440 --> 24:37.590
I want to smell you.

24:43.120 --> 24:45.475
You smell like pizza.

24:45.520 --> 24:50.150
Be careful, don't get too close.
I feel a burp coming on.

24:50.200 --> 24:52.555
- You wouldn't.
- I would.

24:52.600 --> 24:55.831
And remember, sometimes burps
smell worse than farts.

24:55.880 --> 24:58.314
- Is that a threat?
- You guys are so gross.

24:58.360 --> 25:01.796
What, there's no bodily functions
at the deanery? Just catered affairs?

25:03.960 --> 25:07.350
Hey, Dad, don't pick me up
till noon tomorrow, OK?

25:07.400 --> 25:08.879
OK, sweetie.

25:14.480 --> 25:16.277
Very cheerful. Very cheerful.

25:20.240 --> 25:23.312
One night, Felix. That's it. All right?

25:23.360 --> 25:26.318
Understood. I just...
I can't go back there tonight.

25:26.360 --> 25:29.079
I can't face her. Not after this humiliation.

25:29.120 --> 25:32.908
Remind me again how this humiliation
is different from all the others.

25:32.960 --> 25:35.235
I'm gonna need some eggs Benedict
tomorrow, blue man.

25:35.280 --> 25:39.558
That I can do. What I cannot do
is resist the allure of a powerful woman.

25:39.600 --> 25:43.070
So we're 100 per cent sure
she's 100 per cent woman, right?

25:43.120 --> 25:46.396
The balls of steel thing is just metaphorical?

25:47.600 --> 25:49.477
You know what did the trick, Hank?

25:49.520 --> 25:51.829
What sent me over the edge
after weeks of resisting?

25:51.880 --> 25:54.633
One tiny little compliment
about my agenting.

25:54.680 --> 25:57.353
That's it. That's all it takes
to make a man come across.

25:57.400 --> 25:59.595
We are not complicated creatures.

25:59.640 --> 26:03.838
Don't be so hard on yourself.
You were sexually harassed tonight.

26:03.880 --> 26:07.395
As was I. No man can withstand
that kind of pressure.

26:08.480 --> 26:11.438
Yeah, but do you know where I'd be
If I'd been just a tiny bit stronger?

26:11.480 --> 26:13.471
Back in the promised land.

26:13.520 --> 26:16.398
The whole package, man.
My own house, my own bed,

26:16.440 --> 26:18.431
my own wife.

26:19.400 --> 26:22.119
Next year, my Hebrew friend.

26:22.160 --> 26:24.674
Next year in Jerusalem.
