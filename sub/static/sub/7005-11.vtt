WEBVTT

00:01.800 --> 00:03.568
Sure is pretty.

00:03.569 --> 00:05.703
Yeah. When it's done,
it'll look something like that.

00:05.704 --> 00:07.838
I'm gonna go
a little more retro
with mine.

00:07.839 --> 00:10.041
Mr. Leonard, back in
your shop class,

00:10.042 --> 00:12.477
Would you ever have imagined
I could build something
like that?

00:12.478 --> 00:16.314
I was happy when you
finally made an ashtray.

00:16.315 --> 00:19.284
Did you really build a hot rod,
or is that a lot of bunk?

00:19.285 --> 00:21.886
No. You never saw
my other one.

00:21.887 --> 00:24.756
I got pictures of it.
There you go.

00:26.225 --> 00:27.626
Oh...

00:27.627 --> 00:29.661
Gleam in my eye
to a strapping '33 roadster.

00:29.662 --> 00:31.296
Yeah.

00:31.297 --> 00:33.831
I miss that car. It was like
a member of the family.
I loved that thing.

00:33.832 --> 00:36.234
Whatever happened to her?
Sold it.

00:38.671 --> 00:41.873
Glad I'm not a member
of your family.

00:41.874 --> 00:44.442
Sorry - hey,
mr. Leonard.

00:44.443 --> 00:46.645
How are ya? I didn't know
you were in town.
Visiting my daughter.

00:46.646 --> 00:48.647
Aw, great. What are you
doing here?

00:48.648 --> 00:51.550
I hate my son-in-law.

00:51.551 --> 00:53.952
As usual, martin,
you're an hour late.

00:53.953 --> 00:55.953
Yeah, yeah. I was
on the phone with ma.

00:55.954 --> 00:57.789
You know how
she goes on and on.

00:57.790 --> 01:01.392
She doesn't like
talking on the phone.
She likes talking to me.

01:01.393 --> 01:04.662
She hated talking to me.

01:04.663 --> 01:07.164
When he was in high school,
every time I'd call her,
I'd say, "hello, mrs. Taylor."

01:07.165 --> 01:10.035
She'd say, "oh, god,
what's he done now?"

01:10.036 --> 01:13.237
Timmy, come on, it's 2:00.
You gonna feed me?

01:13.238 --> 01:15.474
Soon as I finish the hot rod,
I'll get you a sandwich.

01:15.475 --> 01:17.209
Oh, come on. It took you
three years to build
the last hot rod.

01:17.210 --> 01:21.079
I'm not gonna wait
that long for liverwurst.
I'll help myself.

01:22.881 --> 01:25.517
All right,
what are we doin'?

01:25.518 --> 01:28.586
Finish the assembly
on the rear end,
put the shock on for me.

01:28.587 --> 01:31.723
Can you believe mom
winning 500 bucks in vegas?

01:31.724 --> 01:33.591
Mom went to vegas?

01:33.592 --> 01:35.860
Yeah, she went with that
travel group she's in.

01:35.861 --> 01:38.263
Mom's in a travel group?

01:38.264 --> 01:39.830
The one she went
to ireland with.

01:39.831 --> 01:42.066
Oh, yeah.
Mom went to ireland?

01:44.203 --> 01:46.571
Do you ever talk to mom?

01:46.572 --> 01:48.139
Yeah, we talk every Sunday.

01:48.140 --> 01:51.276
We just don't waste time
yakking about the small stuff.

01:51.277 --> 01:53.578
Yeah. You only yak
about the big stuff,

01:53.579 --> 01:56.515
Like what she had for dinner
and the weather.

01:56.516 --> 01:58.783
Roast beef, partly cloudy.

02:00.753 --> 02:03.522
Guess that explains
why I'm her favorite.

02:03.523 --> 02:06.858
Oh, get out. I'm closer to mom
than you'll ever be.

02:06.859 --> 02:09.961
Oh, yeah? I guess we'll ask her
when she comes next week.

02:09.961 --> 02:13.331
Ok, marty, we sure will.
Mom's coming next week?

03:06.618 --> 03:08.619
When's your mother
supposed to be here?

03:08.620 --> 03:12.390
Any minute. I can't wait to see
the old hunk of junk again.

03:14.560 --> 03:15.860
Your mother?

03:15.861 --> 03:17.696
Her car.

03:17.697 --> 03:22.400
Last time I saw her,
her rear end was sagging,
she had no pick-up.

03:24.704 --> 03:26.204
The car?

03:26.205 --> 03:28.506
No, my mother.

03:28.507 --> 03:29.741
<i>(doorbell rings)</i>

03:29.742 --> 03:31.509
Speaking of which...

03:31.510 --> 03:34.411
Guys, get in here.
Grandma's here.

03:36.214 --> 03:38.816
Hi.
Hey. Hi.

03:38.817 --> 03:40.986
It's so good to see you.

03:40.987 --> 03:42.920
Hello, lucille.
Hi.

03:42.921 --> 03:45.022
Oh, you look great.
How was your trip?

03:45.023 --> 03:48.526
Fast. I had the pedal
on the metal all the way.

03:48.527 --> 03:50.695
Like mother, like son.

03:50.696 --> 03:52.563
Yeah, except
I don't think

03:52.564 --> 03:56.668
She sticks her
head out the window
yelling, "yippee."

03:56.669 --> 03:58.002
Grandma.

03:58.003 --> 04:00.705
My boys, my boys.

04:00.706 --> 04:03.074
Ok, now listen.
Enough of this kissy stuff.

04:03.075 --> 04:05.910
I want you to take my bags
and put 'em upstairs on the bed.

04:05.911 --> 04:08.580
And here's a $10 tip.

04:08.581 --> 04:12.017
I guess that's five for me
and five for you.

04:12.018 --> 04:13.351
What about me?

04:13.352 --> 04:16.021
You get to carry
the bags.

04:16.022 --> 04:18.089
Hey, I want you
to split this up evenly.

04:18.089 --> 04:19.423
All right.

04:19.423 --> 04:21.425
Wait a minute.
About that money -

04:21.426 --> 04:25.063
I want you to deal with it
responsibly.
Shut up, tim.

04:25.064 --> 04:27.665
I want you to
use it for something
completely ridiculous

04:27.666 --> 04:30.068
Or extremely bad
for your teeth.

04:30.069 --> 04:32.170
Mom, you never let us
have junk food.

04:32.171 --> 04:34.906
That's because I was the mother.
Now I'm the grandmother.

04:34.907 --> 04:37.942
This is the grand part.

04:37.943 --> 04:39.611
That's why you're
our favorite, grandma.

04:39.612 --> 04:42.847
That won't get ya
any more money.

04:43.849 --> 04:46.484
You're also
the prettiest, grandma.

04:46.485 --> 04:50.321
That will get you
another ten.

04:53.059 --> 04:54.959
You're my favorite mother.

04:54.960 --> 04:57.762
Aw, tim, sorry.
All out of cash.

04:57.763 --> 05:01.165
Want something to drink?
Club soda, please.

05:01.166 --> 05:05.336
Oh. How's the golf game?
Not so good.

05:05.337 --> 05:08.672
I think I may have torn
some cartilage in my knee.

05:08.673 --> 05:11.443
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Oh, your knee's ok.

05:11.444 --> 05:13.377
No, I'm serious, tim.

05:13.378 --> 05:16.113
I think you're trying
to hustle me out of money
next time we play golf.

05:16.114 --> 05:17.916
Yeah, you're right, tim.

05:17.917 --> 05:21.553
I spent $500 on x-rays
just so I can con you
out of a dollar at golf.

05:21.554 --> 05:25.123
Very clever,
but it's not gonna work.

05:25.124 --> 05:26.424
How's the house?

05:26.425 --> 05:28.693
Big, empty, drafty.

05:28.694 --> 05:31.863
How can it be drafty? I did
the weather stripping myself.

05:31.864 --> 05:33.330
Enough said.

05:34.867 --> 05:38.169
It's not easy rattling around
in that big house.

05:38.170 --> 05:40.004
Gets kinda lonely.

05:40.005 --> 05:42.674
Are you thinking
about moving?
No, she's not gonna move.

05:42.675 --> 05:45.110
If you're lonely,
we'll get you a dog.

05:45.111 --> 05:47.679
Well,
thanks, tim.

05:47.680 --> 05:50.715
Jill, would you like to see
my pictures of ireland?

05:50.716 --> 05:52.316
Ooh, I'd love to.

05:52.317 --> 05:54.552
If you don't want a dog,
how about someone to talk to?
A parrot.

05:54.553 --> 05:59.090
<i>(imitates parrot)</i>
"hey, lucille, you look good.
How about 20 bucks? 20 bucks."

05:59.091 --> 06:00.492
<i>(doorbell rings)</i>

06:00.493 --> 06:02.660
I'll get it.
Oh, thanks.

06:04.463 --> 06:06.163
Mrs. Taylor.

06:06.164 --> 06:09.133
Mr. Leonard. Oh, my god,
what did tim do now?

06:09.134 --> 06:12.070
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

06:12.071 --> 06:15.540
My gosh, you look great.
You haven't changed a bit.

06:15.541 --> 06:17.942
Well, you have.
Your eyesight's slipping.

06:17.943 --> 06:20.110
Hello, mr. Leonard.

06:20.111 --> 06:23.614
Hi, jill. I came by to pick up
that sweater I left here
the other day.

06:32.191 --> 06:35.960
I was wearing it so I'd remember
to give it back to you.

06:35.961 --> 06:38.629
I'm glad I didn't leave
my underwear.

06:40.165 --> 06:43.634
Oh, like they'd fit me.

06:43.635 --> 06:46.437
Oh, your eyesight may
be going, but you still have
your sense of humor.

06:46.438 --> 06:49.207
Would you like
to stay for dinner?

06:49.208 --> 06:51.075
Oh, I'd love to have
a good home-cooked meal.

06:51.076 --> 06:53.243
Me too.
Where we gonna get it?

06:54.947 --> 06:56.214
Mr. Leonard -

06:56.215 --> 06:58.015
Please call me art.

06:58.016 --> 07:00.017
How about a beer, art?
Mr. Leonard.

07:01.686 --> 07:04.521
I don't think
I ever told you, art,
how much I appreciate

07:04.522 --> 07:07.424
Your putting tim
on the right track
in high school.

07:07.425 --> 07:09.961
Hey, you put him
on the right path to life.

07:09.962 --> 07:12.697
I could only take him so far.
Jill took him the distance.

07:12.698 --> 07:14.732
It was a group effort.

07:14.733 --> 07:17.001
Hey,
don't I get any credit
for turning out so well?

07:17.002 --> 07:19.704
No.
Nah.

07:19.705 --> 07:23.308
Jill, did you know that
every time tim got into
trouble in high school,

07:23.309 --> 07:25.876
Art took the time to make
a personal call to me?

07:25.877 --> 07:28.947
Oh, I had to call ya.
I knew he wasn't giving
the notes I sent home.

07:28.948 --> 07:31.382
What notes?

07:34.186 --> 07:37.888
They're - I-I-I was going
to give them to you tomorrow.

07:41.560 --> 07:44.896
I can't believe you have to
lean way out over the edge
of a castle

07:44.897 --> 07:47.398
To kiss the blarney stone.
Weren't you scared?

07:47.399 --> 07:51.603
Hey, after raising
five boys by myself,
nothing scares me.

07:51.604 --> 07:54.138
Well, why do you kiss
the blarney stone, anyway?

07:54.139 --> 07:57.675
So it'll follow you
back to your apartment
for a nightcap.

07:57.676 --> 07:59.544
No, pea brain.

07:59.545 --> 08:02.647
The blarney stone
gives you the gift of gab.

08:02.648 --> 08:05.783
My parents took me there
when I was but a wee lad,

08:05.784 --> 08:07.852
And I haven't
stopped talking since.

08:07.853 --> 08:11.556
I like a man who can hold up
his end of the conversation.

08:11.557 --> 08:14.792
I like a woman
who's not afraid to hang
upside down from a castle.

08:14.793 --> 08:17.161
Maybe you should date a bat.

08:21.934 --> 08:27.104
All this talk about blarney
is making me thirsty
for an irish coffee.

08:27.105 --> 08:29.974
What do you say we head over
to mccauliffe's and get one?

08:29.975 --> 08:31.976
That's a great idea.
Head to an irish pub.

08:31.977 --> 08:33.344
Who invited you?

08:33.345 --> 08:35.914
I thought you did.

08:35.914 --> 08:37.847
I guess I was
a wee bit mistaken.

08:45.124 --> 08:47.624
It sounds lovely,
but, see, I just got here.

08:47.625 --> 08:49.660
Oh, lucille, go.
Have a good time.

08:49.661 --> 08:51.796
Oh, great.

08:51.797 --> 08:53.631
Hey, mom, it's late,

08:53.632 --> 08:55.633
You're tired,
you just got here.

08:55.634 --> 08:58.002
We're doing <i>tool time</i>
tomorrow. You're gonna
wanna be peppy.

08:58.003 --> 09:00.772
Peppy? Tim,
I may be getting old,

09:00.773 --> 09:04.275
But I think I've got enough pep
to sit through <i>tool time.</i>

09:04.276 --> 09:05.976
Don't be so sure.

09:05.977 --> 09:09.179
Younger people than you
haven't been able to make it
all the way through.

09:10.749 --> 09:12.583
Thanks for
a wonderful dinner.

09:12.584 --> 09:15.185
Yeah, jill, thanks.
Come on, peppy, let's go.

09:16.455 --> 09:19.824
I can't believe
you let her go.

09:19.825 --> 09:21.992
Let her go?

09:21.993 --> 09:24.862
She's a grown woman.
She wanted to go.

09:24.863 --> 09:28.299
She shows up, drops her
suitcases off, heads out
for a night on the town.

09:28.300 --> 09:30.601
What is this, a hotel?

09:30.602 --> 09:33.671
She did tip the boys.

09:33.672 --> 09:35.773
She didn't even
look at the hot rod.

09:35.774 --> 09:38.075
Big deal.
She'll see it tomorrow.

09:38.076 --> 09:39.710
It's a big deal to me.

09:39.711 --> 09:41.712
How would you feel if your mom
came over for a visit,

09:41.713 --> 09:45.015
And five minutes later,
she took off?
Like I'd won the lottery.

09:47.118 --> 09:48.886
This is just like you.

09:48.887 --> 09:51.322
We're trying to have
a serious conversation,
you make jokes.

09:51.323 --> 09:53.357
Honey, if you're
that upset about it,

09:53.358 --> 09:56.227
Why don't you wait till
she gets home and talk to her?
Tell her how you feel.

09:56.228 --> 09:58.429
I don't like talking
about my feelings.

09:58.430 --> 10:00.431
You do it with me
all the time.

10:00.432 --> 10:02.633
That's 'cause you make me.

10:06.538 --> 10:08.506
<i>(door closes)</i>

10:10.843 --> 10:13.044
Hi, mom.

10:15.013 --> 10:17.081
Tim, what are you
doing up?

10:17.082 --> 10:19.183
Uh, waiting for mark.

10:21.320 --> 10:24.922
Often times, he stumbles in
at 3am, too.

10:24.923 --> 10:27.291
You were waiting for me,
weren't you?

10:27.292 --> 10:30.527
No. I was working on
the hot rod.

10:30.528 --> 10:32.630
What were you doing
out so late?

10:32.631 --> 10:35.466
When you used to go out late,
what were you doing?

10:35.467 --> 10:38.736
Well, I...
Let's not go...

10:39.938 --> 10:41.972
Let's not go there.

10:43.575 --> 10:47.511
Art and I
closed down the bar.
He's so easy to talk to.

10:47.512 --> 10:49.513
Do you know
it has been ages

10:49.514 --> 10:51.782
Since I've spent
time alone with a man?

10:51.783 --> 10:54.518
Whew, let's not
go there, either.

10:56.021 --> 10:59.256
Fine. I think
I'll head up to bed.

10:59.257 --> 11:01.992
Do you mind
if I go there?

11:01.993 --> 11:04.594
As long as you're up,
you wanna see the hot rod?

11:04.595 --> 11:06.831
It's three in the morning.
Can't it wait till tomorrow?

11:06.832 --> 11:09.300
Sure.

11:09.301 --> 11:11.102
Could've seen it earlier

11:11.103 --> 11:13.470
If you hadn't
darted right out
after dinner.

11:18.176 --> 11:21.011
What is that
supposed to mean?
Nothing.

11:21.012 --> 11:23.047
Sorry. It's just that
I haven't seen you in a while.

11:23.048 --> 11:26.050
I thought you could stay here,
and we could talk or something.

11:26.051 --> 11:27.551
You wanna talk?

11:27.552 --> 11:29.386
What's wrong with that?

11:29.387 --> 11:32.223
I tried to talk to you
earlier, and you didn't
seem very interested.

11:32.224 --> 11:33.924
I was interested.

11:33.925 --> 11:35.826
You didn't act that way.

11:35.827 --> 11:39.496
I told you I had a problem
with my knee, and you made
a big joke about it.

11:39.497 --> 11:42.266
Then I told you
I was lonely in the house,

11:42.267 --> 11:45.069
And you started
to imitate a parrot.

11:45.070 --> 11:47.237
You used to like my imitations.
Remember that monkey?

11:47.238 --> 11:50.207
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh.

11:51.609 --> 11:53.644
You're doing it again, tim.

11:53.645 --> 11:56.113
What am I doing again?

11:56.114 --> 11:58.749
When I try to tell you
what's really going on
with me,

11:58.750 --> 12:01.419
You don't wanna
listen to me.
I wanna listen to you.

12:01.420 --> 12:03.421
You do the same thing
every Sunday.

12:03.422 --> 12:05.456
I call, I try to have
a real conversation
with you,

12:05.457 --> 12:08.392
And all you ever ask me
is, "how's the buick?"

12:08.393 --> 12:10.561
We talk about other stuff.

12:10.562 --> 12:13.397
Are you having a problem
with the buick?

12:15.000 --> 12:19.102
Tim, there's a sign
over your head

12:19.103 --> 12:22.640
That says,
"not getting it."

12:22.641 --> 12:24.876
Good night.

12:24.877 --> 12:26.543
Good night.

12:36.254 --> 12:38.222
Ok, boys, let's go.

12:38.223 --> 12:40.457
Where we going?

12:40.458 --> 12:43.360
I'm taking us to our annual
ice-cream breakfast

12:43.361 --> 12:45.096
At leo's sugar shack.

12:45.097 --> 12:47.331
All right.

12:47.332 --> 12:51.936
And what restaurant are we
going to tell your parents
we went to?

12:51.937 --> 12:53.638
The healthy vegetable.

12:53.639 --> 12:55.740
Very good.

12:55.741 --> 12:59.143
And, mark, if anybody asks,
you had?

12:59.144 --> 13:01.112
Wheat-germ omelet.

13:01.113 --> 13:02.813
Excellent.

13:02.814 --> 13:04.381
Brad?

13:04.382 --> 13:06.851
I had bean turd.

13:09.588 --> 13:12.022
That's bean curd.

13:14.693 --> 13:17.562
Oh. They taste the same.

13:19.431 --> 13:21.465
Randy, what did you have?

13:21.466 --> 13:24.268
I had an alfalfa shake,
and then I threw up.

13:24.269 --> 13:26.771
Nice touch.

13:26.772 --> 13:29.040
Where you guys going
for breakfast?

13:29.041 --> 13:31.275
Um, the healthy vegetable.

13:31.276 --> 13:33.710
Can we bring you
something?

13:33.711 --> 13:36.580
Um, a pint of
mint chocolate chip.

13:37.716 --> 13:39.884
You got it.

13:39.885 --> 13:41.084
Hi, hon.

13:41.085 --> 13:44.087
Don't start with me.
What?

13:44.088 --> 13:47.057
It was your idea to have
a conversation with my mom.
It was a disaster.

13:47.058 --> 13:51.662
She says I'm incapable
of having a real conversation.
Can you believe she said that?

13:51.663 --> 13:52.897
Yeah-huh.

13:52.898 --> 13:55.032
What you mean, yeah-huh?

13:55.033 --> 13:56.867
Every time she calls,
all you do

13:56.868 --> 13:58.803
Is ask her about the car
and hand me the phone.

13:58.804 --> 14:01.505
That's a real conversation.
Yeah, real lame one.

14:01.506 --> 14:03.440
My mother has nothing
to complain about.

14:03.441 --> 14:05.943
I do more for her
than all the rest
of my brothers combined.

14:05.944 --> 14:08.813
I fix her car. I drove 300 miles
to put her storm windows in.

14:08.814 --> 14:13.117
I know. I think
she just wants to connect
on a more emotional level.

14:13.118 --> 14:15.118
People share their emotions
in different ways.

14:15.119 --> 14:17.421
Some people talk
about their feelings
with their mother,

14:17.422 --> 14:19.857
And some people
scotchgard her sofa.

14:19.858 --> 14:25.062
Well, scotchgarding
is a powerful way
to show intimacy.

14:25.063 --> 14:27.531
You gotta admit
there's something different
with her.

14:27.532 --> 14:31.369
She never used to dredge up
old feelings. She kept them
inside where they belong.

14:31.370 --> 14:35.272
No, that's where
ulcers belong.

14:35.273 --> 14:37.742
Look, I agree with you.
I think she has changed.

14:37.743 --> 14:41.846
Evidently she wants to share
some real moments with you.

14:41.847 --> 14:44.882
Why?
Because that's how
you feel close to people.

14:44.883 --> 14:46.550
That's ridiculous.

14:46.551 --> 14:49.487
I've had plenty
of close relationships
with people

14:49.488 --> 14:52.156
That I've never shared
a real moment with.

14:58.863 --> 15:00.464
Hey, tim.

15:00.465 --> 15:01.966
Hi, al.

15:01.967 --> 15:04.035
Boy, it was awfully nice of you
to invite me down for coffee.

15:04.036 --> 15:07.171
You haven't done that
in a long time. Or ever.

15:08.807 --> 15:10.608
I thought it'd give us
a good chance to talk.

15:10.609 --> 15:13.010
Oh, yeah? About what?
Mothers.

15:13.011 --> 15:18.015
Oh, no. No. Oh, boy,
I should've seen
this one coming.

15:18.016 --> 15:21.252
You invited me down here
to make fun of my mother.
No.

15:21.253 --> 15:25.322
Ok, well, what's it gonna be
today? More fat jokes?

15:25.323 --> 15:28.492
You've already done
all those. How about her
perspiration problem?

15:28.493 --> 15:31.195
Or maybe the way
her jowls sway.

15:31.196 --> 15:35.966
Or how about the way the skin
under her arms wobble?

15:35.967 --> 15:39.169
Al, there's people
eating food in here.

15:39.170 --> 15:41.505
Sit down.

15:41.506 --> 15:43.641
I wanna talk about
my mother.

15:43.642 --> 15:46.277
Does she wobble?
No.

15:46.278 --> 15:49.813
Look, no one knows more
about mothers than you do,

15:49.814 --> 15:52.449
And I wanna bounce
something off you.

15:52.450 --> 15:55.152
Well, sure, bounce away.

15:55.153 --> 15:58.956
Ok. Last night, my mom
got kind of mad at me,

15:58.957 --> 16:01.058
And she says
we don't communicate

16:01.059 --> 16:03.461
Because I talk
on a superficial level?

16:03.462 --> 16:05.462
Oh, I can totally relate.

16:05.463 --> 16:08.832
So you know
what I'm going through?
I can relate to your mother.

16:08.833 --> 16:11.334
Tim, the only
real conversation
we ever have

16:11.335 --> 16:13.771
Is when
I say something real,
and you tell me to shut up.

16:13.772 --> 16:16.440
Shut up.

16:16.441 --> 16:19.176
Tim, al.

16:30.021 --> 16:31.622
Wilson...

16:31.623 --> 16:33.657
I'm really sorry,
but I couldn't help
but overhear

16:33.658 --> 16:35.893
What you were saying.

16:35.894 --> 16:38.195
I didn't know
you knew about this place.

16:38.196 --> 16:42.066
I often come here
when the healthy vegetable
is closed.

16:42.067 --> 16:44.101
You know, I love
their bean curd.

16:44.102 --> 16:47.038
Oh, yeah.
Boy, it's to die for.

16:47.039 --> 16:50.975
Or to die from.
I've had one of those things.

16:50.976 --> 16:53.577
So I really don't mean
to intrude,

16:53.578 --> 16:57.214
But I thought I might
be able to offer my perspective
on what you were talking about.

16:57.215 --> 16:59.517
Al's mom's arm wobble?

16:59.518 --> 17:01.385
Oh, no, no, tim.

17:01.386 --> 17:04.121
I'm talking about
the problem that you're having
with your mother.

17:04.122 --> 17:06.857
You know, when you finish
talking about tim's mother,

17:06.858 --> 17:09.693
I'd like to talk to you
about my relationship
with my mother.

17:09.694 --> 17:12.997
I'm sorry, al, but I don't think
I have that kind of time today.

17:14.866 --> 17:18.268
Order me something,
and I don't want the bean turd.

17:20.838 --> 17:22.973
What do you think?

17:22.973 --> 17:26.076
Tim, I think that you may
already know the answer.

17:26.077 --> 17:28.479
I already have the answer?

17:28.480 --> 17:30.714
Yes. I'm reminded of
something you told me
a couple of years ago

17:30.715 --> 17:32.383
About your father.

17:32.384 --> 17:34.452
What does my father
have to do with this?

17:34.453 --> 17:37.788
You remember telling me that
the great regret for your life

17:37.789 --> 17:39.824
Is that you never
got to know him very well?

17:39.825 --> 17:42.660
He died when I was 11. I didn't
have the chance to know him.

17:42.661 --> 17:44.728
Your mom's still alive.

17:44.729 --> 17:47.931
You wanna ruin
that chance with her?

17:53.137 --> 17:54.938
Hi, mom.
Hi, tim.

17:55.940 --> 17:58.575
Bring the boys with you?

17:58.576 --> 18:01.411
Oh, no, the boys.

18:02.647 --> 18:05.549
How many of them
were there?

18:05.550 --> 18:06.817
Mom...

18:06.818 --> 18:09.453
I left them at the mall.

18:09.454 --> 18:12.122
Can we talk about last night?

18:12.123 --> 18:15.325
Oh, it's ok, tim.
I'm sorry we got into it.

18:15.326 --> 18:18.395
I know we both love each other,
and that's enough for me.

18:18.396 --> 18:20.997
Well, what if
it's not enough for me?

18:20.998 --> 18:23.133
I really think
we should talk about this.

18:23.134 --> 18:26.503
I don't want you to
have to talk about anything
that makes you uncomfortable.

18:26.504 --> 18:28.838
I understand that.

18:28.839 --> 18:32.175
Look, mom, I'm really sorry
I cut you off when you're
trying to talk to me,

18:32.176 --> 18:35.646
But I'm just not used to you
coming to me with stuff
like this.

18:35.647 --> 18:38.048
I'm not used to having
to go to anybody

18:38.049 --> 18:40.250
With stuff like this.

18:40.251 --> 18:42.986
It's just that,
of all my boys,

18:42.987 --> 18:47.291
I was hoping you were the one
that I could open up to.

18:47.292 --> 18:48.926
Why me?

18:48.927 --> 18:53.063
You've always been
the strong one in the family.

18:53.064 --> 18:54.497
I have?

18:56.600 --> 18:58.969
Oh, come on, mom.
You're the strong one.

18:58.970 --> 19:02.206
I still can't believe
how strong you were
when dad died.

19:02.207 --> 19:05.309
Oh, I had no choice.

19:05.310 --> 19:08.178
I had a house full of boys
without a father.

19:08.179 --> 19:10.447
I just did what I had to do.

19:12.250 --> 19:16.753
Sometimes I don't know how
I got up in the morning.

19:16.754 --> 19:18.321
I was so empty.

19:20.659 --> 19:22.726
And I felt so bad

19:22.727 --> 19:25.462
That I couldn't give you boys
the kind of attention

19:25.463 --> 19:27.498
That I knew you needed.

19:27.499 --> 19:30.234
Mom...
Especially you, tim.

19:30.235 --> 19:32.636
What do you mean,
especially me?

19:32.637 --> 19:34.204
You took it the hardest
when dad died.

19:34.205 --> 19:37.474
You kept everything
bottled up inside.

19:37.475 --> 19:40.511
Maybe that's why you can't
talk about anything serious

19:40.512 --> 19:42.513
Without making a joke.

19:42.514 --> 19:46.783
Oh, I've gotten over that now.
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh.

19:49.320 --> 19:52.623
I just wish I could've done
a better job

19:52.624 --> 19:54.625
Of helping you through
those times.

19:54.626 --> 19:57.194
You did a great job.
Oh, I don't know.

19:57.195 --> 20:00.364
If it hadn't been for you,
I would've never gotten
through it.

20:01.233 --> 20:03.900
Oh...
Thanks, tim.

20:06.238 --> 20:09.406
Mom... You know what?

20:09.407 --> 20:13.043
I want you to talk to me
about stuff.

20:13.044 --> 20:19.116
I don't wanna miss knowing you
the way I missed knowing dad.

20:20.018 --> 20:23.353
I don't want that, either.

20:23.354 --> 20:25.823
Boy, it kills me that
I didn't get to know him.

20:25.824 --> 20:30.227
You know, you two would've
gotten such a kick
out of each other.

20:30.228 --> 20:33.096
When I watch you
working on that hot rod,

20:33.097 --> 20:37.033
I keep thinking, "there's
something dad would've
loved doing with him."

20:37.034 --> 20:40.036
You think we would've
gotten along?
Like a nut and a bolt.

20:40.037 --> 20:41.739
Ha-ha.

20:42.874 --> 20:46.410
And I think we know
who the nut is.

20:47.612 --> 20:50.547
Oh, tim, I love you.

20:50.548 --> 20:52.683
I love you.

20:52.684 --> 20:54.785
Enough of this
kissy stuff.

20:54.786 --> 20:57.187
Shouldn't we
be heading down
to <i>tool time?</i>

20:57.188 --> 21:01.425
Oh... Yeah. Gotta write
some new stuff.

21:01.426 --> 21:03.961
I'm gonna lay off the jokes
about al's mom for a while.

21:03.962 --> 21:06.162
Oh, darn. I love those.

21:08.400 --> 21:11.168
Let me ask you one thing
that has been bugging me.
Sure.

21:11.169 --> 21:13.504
Is marty your favorite?

21:15.106 --> 21:16.406
Yes.

21:23.548 --> 21:26.650
It's gonna be a lot of work
to sell the house and move,

21:26.651 --> 21:29.920
But I'm really glad
I finally made the decision
to do it.

21:29.921 --> 21:33.056
It's gonna
be nice for all of us
to have you close by.

21:33.057 --> 21:36.693
Do you know what I dread most
about moving?

21:36.694 --> 21:38.461
Leaving your memories
behind?

21:38.462 --> 21:41.564
No. Leaving
hector the handyman behind.

21:43.368 --> 21:46.570
Whenever tim
pulls out of my driveway
after fixing something,

21:46.571 --> 21:49.239
I speed dial hector.

21:53.511 --> 21:56.412
Believe me, I understand
and don't tell tim

21:56.413 --> 21:58.281
That I gave you
this number.

21:58.282 --> 22:01.551
This is
joe the handyman.

22:01.552 --> 22:02.585
Oh, thank you.

22:05.823 --> 22:09.259
Oh, boy. Wife and mother
in the same room.

22:09.260 --> 22:12.896
Can't be good for me.

22:12.897 --> 22:16.200
Your mother was saying
how nice it's gonna be
when she's living close by.

22:16.201 --> 22:21.605
Yeah. I'm nearby. I can
stop by and fix things
any time you want.

22:21.606 --> 22:23.440
Gee, thanks, tim.

22:23.441 --> 22:27.010
I can't tell you what
a feeling of security
that gives me.

22:27.011 --> 22:30.481
Now I can buy a house
and not worry about a thing.

22:30.482 --> 22:33.850
Really? You gave her
joe's number, didn't you?

22:36.654 --> 22:38.222
Yep.

22:38.223 --> 22:41.224
Good, 'cause he's a lot better
than hector.

22:46.130 --> 22:48.932
My mom has nothing
to complain about.

22:48.933 --> 22:51.334
I do more for her than
all of my brothers combined.

22:51.335 --> 22:54.571
I drive up there
and fix her car. 300 miles
to put in her storm windows.

22:54.572 --> 22:58.375
I think she wants
to connect with you on
a more emotional level.

22:58.376 --> 23:02.545
Emotional-shomotional.
Come on. Ha-ha-ha.

23:07.284 --> 23:09.419
Emotional-shomotional.
