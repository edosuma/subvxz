00:05.523 --> 00:07.557
Boy, I really miss
the Bermuda Triangle.

00:07.625 --> 00:09.955
I guess there's not much action
down there these days.

00:10.027 --> 00:11.389
Oh, there's action.

00:11.462 --> 00:12.790
There's plenty of action.

00:12.863 --> 00:15.591
It's that damn alien autopsy
stealing all the headlines.

00:15.666 --> 00:16.994
Yeah, tell me about it.

00:17.068 --> 00:20.535
See, what they gotta do is lose
a plane or a Greenpeace boat.

00:20.604 --> 00:22.831
See, that would get
the Triangle going again.

00:22.907 --> 00:26.101
What keeps the water in there?
I mean, why doesn't that disappear?

00:27.078 --> 00:29.908
Now, what would be the point
of taking the water?

00:30.147 --> 00:32.147
It's gorgeous water.

00:33.451 --> 00:34.916
Do we own Bermuda?

00:34.986 --> 00:37.316
No, it belongs to the British.

00:37.555 --> 00:39.589
Lucky Krauts.

00:41.258 --> 00:43.087
What do you think
of that alien autopsy?

00:43.160 --> 00:45.728
- Oh, that's real.
- I think so too.

00:51.535 --> 00:53.967
The doctor will be
with you in a moment.

01:03.047 --> 01:04.808
"Difficult"?

01:04.882 --> 01:07.951
Elaine, you shouldn't
be reading that.

01:08.019 --> 01:11.145
Now, tell me
about this rash of yours.

01:11.822 --> 01:13.719
Well, it's... It's....

01:14.825 --> 01:18.258
You know, I notice
that someone wrote in my chart...

01:18.329 --> 01:22.024
that I was difficult
in January of '92.

01:22.099 --> 01:24.929
And I have to tell you,
I remember that appointment exactly.

01:25.002 --> 01:28.538
You see, this nurse
had asked me to put a gown on...

01:28.606 --> 01:31.038
but it was a mole on my shoulder...

01:31.108 --> 01:33.699
and actually I had specifically
worn a tank top...

01:33.778 --> 01:36.676
so that I wouldn't
have to put a gown on.

01:36.847 --> 01:39.814
You know, they're made of paper.

01:40.084 --> 01:42.948
Well, that was a long time ago.

01:43.054 --> 01:46.681
How about if I just erase it?

01:48.225 --> 01:51.988
Now, about that rash?

01:53.230 --> 01:55.059
But it was in pen.

01:56.801 --> 01:59.426
You fake erased.

02:00.438 --> 02:03.200
All right, Miss Benes.
This doesn't look too serious.

02:03.274 --> 02:05.103
You should be fine.

02:05.176 --> 02:06.868
What are you writing?

02:07.945 --> 02:09.342
Doctor?

02:11.215 --> 02:13.613
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

02:13.684 --> 02:16.548
I hope you got that
mustard stain out of your shirt.

02:24.995 --> 02:27.086
Jerry, what's the matter
with your stereo?

02:27.164 --> 02:29.892
I don't know.
What's the matter with your stereo?

02:29.967 --> 02:32.433
I traded it to Lomez for some steaks.

02:33.170 --> 02:34.498
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:34.572 --> 02:36.697
- Now, see, this is busted.
- No, it works.

02:36.774 --> 02:38.705
- It's busted.
- Watch out. Let me show you.

02:38.776 --> 02:42.277
All you gotta do is... You gotta
jiggle it with this screwdriver.

02:42.346 --> 02:43.811
Smile.

02:43.881 --> 02:46.108
- What are you doing?
- I met this woman Sheila.

02:46.183 --> 02:48.581
She works down at the one-hour
photo place.

02:48.652 --> 02:51.915
She's got this incredible smile.
It's like she's got too many teeth.

02:51.989 --> 02:53.488
Extra teeth. I love that look.

02:53.557 --> 02:56.751
And check this out. I go to pick up
my pictures and she says:

02:56.827 --> 03:00.294
"l hope you got that mustard stain
out of your shirt."

03:00.364 --> 03:02.796
- What mustard stain?
- Don't you see?

03:02.867 --> 03:05.435
She's looking at my pictures.

03:05.503 --> 03:07.764
Why did you take a picture
of a mustard stain?

03:07.838 --> 03:11.066
- It's got nothing to do with this.
- I see, she's looking.

03:11.142 --> 03:13.369
Yes.

03:13.978 --> 03:15.477
You gotta get this thing fixed.

03:15.546 --> 03:17.807
They've tried.
It keeps coming back the same.

03:17.882 --> 03:20.450
- You interested in a refund?
- I can't get a refund.

03:20.518 --> 03:23.781
- The warranty expired two years ago.
- Would you be interested?

03:23.854 --> 03:25.444
- How you gonna...?
- Would you?

03:25.523 --> 03:27.022
- I guess I would.
- Yeah, yeah.

03:28.492 --> 03:29.923
You are not gonna believe...

03:29.994 --> 03:32.654
what happened to me
at the doctor's office today.

03:32.730 --> 03:34.525
Not the gown again?

03:35.399 --> 03:40.163
No. No. I was looking at my chart,
and it said that I was difficult.

03:40.237 --> 03:41.861
Why would they write that?

03:41.939 --> 03:43.301
They've gotten to know you.

03:43.807 --> 03:46.171
And then the doctor
writes more stuff down there...

03:46.243 --> 03:48.436
and he doesn't
even look at my rash.

03:48.512 --> 03:50.603
Find one that doesn't
know you're difficult.

03:50.681 --> 03:53.716
Come on. I'm not difficult. I'm easy.

03:53.784 --> 03:56.512
Why? Because you dress casual
and sleep with a lot of guys?

03:57.588 --> 03:59.349
- Listen to me, you little sh...
- Smile.

04:02.259 --> 04:05.192
Elaine, you really
didn't have to put on the gown.

04:05.596 --> 04:07.220
It's my pleasure. I love these.

04:07.298 --> 04:09.127
You know, in fact,
I've got one at home.

04:09.200 --> 04:11.734
It's perfect when you
just wanna throw something on.

04:12.203 --> 04:14.328
- Hi.
- Thank you.

04:14.605 --> 04:16.366
All right.

04:16.940 --> 04:19.373
Let me just review your history
before we begin.

04:19.442 --> 04:22.205
Oh, where did you get my chart?

04:22.279 --> 04:25.246
From your last doctor.
It's standard procedure.

04:25.316 --> 04:28.476
You know, I can tell you my
whole history. Let's just...

04:30.921 --> 04:32.249
Okay. Let's take a look.

04:33.057 --> 04:36.126
Well, that doesn't look too serious.
You'll be fine.

04:37.061 --> 04:40.426
Please, please. It...
But it's really, really itchy.

04:45.803 --> 04:47.734
Oh, no.

04:52.176 --> 04:54.141
- Seinfeld?
- Yeah.

04:54.511 --> 04:56.772
Got a package for you. Sign here.

04:56.847 --> 04:59.541
- Oh, who's it from?
- No return address.

04:59.617 --> 05:00.945
What if I don't want it?

05:01.352 --> 05:03.010
Are you refusing delivery?

05:03.087 --> 05:04.882
- Maybe I am.
- Why would you do that?

05:04.955 --> 05:06.750
- Never done it before.
- Why start now?

05:06.824 --> 05:08.391
Why not?

05:11.195 --> 05:12.922
All right.

05:16.333 --> 05:18.799
Why'd you refuse that?
Everybody loves a package.

05:18.869 --> 05:20.197
I don't know. It was weird.

05:20.271 --> 05:22.100
Crazy printing.
I don't know who from.

05:22.339 --> 05:23.929
What do you think? It's a bomb?

05:24.208 --> 05:26.105
It's not totally impossible.

05:27.645 --> 05:29.576
The ego on you.

05:29.647 --> 05:33.148
- Why can't I be bomb-able?
- Who's gonna bomb you?

05:33.217 --> 05:36.753
An airline for all the stupid
little peanut jokes?

05:36.820 --> 05:39.616
Oh, I suppose you think
you're bomb-able?

05:39.690 --> 05:42.122
Couple people wouldn't mind
having me out of the way.

05:42.192 --> 05:44.317
There's more than a couple.

05:44.828 --> 05:47.453
Check these out.
I just picked them up from Sheila.

05:47.531 --> 05:49.622
She must have loved these.

05:49.700 --> 05:52.325
- You don't have a Mercedes.
- I know. Just leaned on it...

05:52.403 --> 05:54.061
so it'd look like it was mine.

05:54.138 --> 05:55.796
The driver seems a little put out.

05:55.873 --> 05:57.406
No, he was fine with it.

05:57.474 --> 05:59.269
Check this out.

05:59.977 --> 06:01.305
Is that Burt Reynolds?

06:01.779 --> 06:03.574
Wax Museum.

06:06.116 --> 06:09.185
- What is this?
- That is a lot of skin.

06:09.553 --> 06:12.747
This must be Sheila
from the photo place.

06:12.823 --> 06:15.858
- You can barely see her face.
- She must have slipped it in here.

06:20.964 --> 06:25.125
- Photo-store Sheila.
- Well, hello, photo-store Sheila.

06:25.202 --> 06:27.896
All right. I will see you boys later.

06:27.971 --> 06:30.232
- Where are you going?
- To ask her out.

06:30.307 --> 06:34.002
- No, no. You're not playing the game.
- What game?

06:34.078 --> 06:36.339
She goes to these lengths
to entice you...

06:36.413 --> 06:39.311
and your only response is,
"Gee, I really like your picture.

06:39.383 --> 06:42.350
Would you like to go out
on a date with me, please?"

06:44.088 --> 06:48.022
- No good?
- It's the timeless art of seduction.

06:48.092 --> 06:51.753
You gotta join in the dance.
She sends you an enticing photo...

06:51.829 --> 06:55.194
- you send her one right back.
- Oh, I don't know.

06:55.265 --> 06:58.857
Well, as you know, I've always
been something of a photog.

06:58.936 --> 07:02.005
Oh, yeah, I like this idea.

07:02.606 --> 07:04.298
Hey, Danny.

07:04.375 --> 07:07.535
- Hello. How are you?
- Hey, Leo.

07:07.611 --> 07:10.509
Hey, what's with your nephew?
He wouldn't accept the package.

07:10.581 --> 07:12.706
Oh, he wants it.
He's just trying to be funny.

07:12.783 --> 07:14.748
Yeah, I'll sign for it.

07:16.854 --> 07:19.081
And then he started
writing on my chart.

07:19.556 --> 07:22.318
Just get ahold of it
and change what you don't like.

07:22.393 --> 07:24.688
You can't change your chart.
It's your chart.

07:24.762 --> 07:26.887
I'm in my personnel file
at work all the time.

07:26.964 --> 07:30.795
- You are?
- I've kept the same job over two years.

07:30.868 --> 07:32.697
It's not luck.

07:33.036 --> 07:36.264
Elaine, have you ever sent a racy
photograph of yourself to anyone?

07:37.040 --> 07:40.769
Yeah. I sent one to everyone I know.

07:40.844 --> 07:42.502
You remember my Christmas card?

07:43.080 --> 07:45.273
Oh, right.

07:45.783 --> 07:47.441
The nipple.

07:52.423 --> 07:55.083
But aside from that,
how did you feel about Kramer's work?

07:55.159 --> 07:57.250
Actually, I thought
he was very professional.

07:57.327 --> 07:59.088
- It was a good experience?
- Oh, yeah.

07:59.163 --> 08:01.697
I liked the picture so much
I cropped out the nipple...

08:01.765 --> 08:03.765
and I'm using it
for my health-club lD.

08:03.834 --> 08:06.767
- Nice.
- Yeah, it is nice actually.

08:07.805 --> 08:09.770
Please, I've gotta see
Dr. Berg right away.

08:09.840 --> 08:12.932
- This rash is spreading.
- He can't see you. He's busy.

08:13.010 --> 08:14.941
Oh, come on.
Have some compassion.

08:18.182 --> 08:21.479
Well, I hope it's contagious then.

08:38.068 --> 08:41.261
Come on. Move.

08:44.908 --> 08:46.942
Oh, hi, Dr. Berg.

08:47.010 --> 08:49.806
- I didn't know if...
- The chart, Miss Benes.

08:55.853 --> 08:58.581
Oh, please, no more.

09:01.992 --> 09:03.320
- Hey.
- Where's Kramer?

09:03.393 --> 09:05.484
He went to get
some steak sauce. Why?

09:06.163 --> 09:07.594
Personal matter.

09:09.800 --> 09:14.462
- Hello.
- Jerry, it's your Uncle Leo. Hello.

09:14.538 --> 09:17.368
Hello, Leo. You don't have to yell.

09:17.641 --> 09:19.368
I got your package.

09:19.443 --> 09:22.273
- How did you get my package?
- Leo's got your package?

09:22.346 --> 09:25.108
- What should I do with it?
- I don't know what you should do.

09:25.182 --> 09:26.874
Tell him to open it.

09:26.950 --> 09:30.281
I'm not gonna treat my uncle
like a bomb-defusing robot.

09:30.654 --> 09:32.722
Jerry, your cousin Jeffrey...

09:32.789 --> 09:35.949
is in a Parks Department
production of The Mikado.

09:36.026 --> 09:38.287
I want you to come see it with me.

09:38.362 --> 09:42.023
- Open the package, Leo.
- Okay.

09:42.366 --> 09:45.094
Opening.

09:54.111 --> 09:55.473
So it wasn't a bomb?

09:55.546 --> 09:58.672
No. No bomb.

09:59.049 --> 10:01.515
- Well, then, what?
- Oh, stupid Leo.

10:01.585 --> 10:04.745
He was using those oven cleaners.
He left the canister in there.

10:04.821 --> 10:07.389
The pilot light was on.
The whole thing blew up.

10:07.658 --> 10:09.521
- But he's okay?
- Yeah.

10:09.593 --> 10:12.594
But the explosion singed off
his eyebrows, mustache, everything.

10:12.663 --> 10:15.357
He's all smooth now.
Looks like a seal.

10:16.700 --> 10:18.597
Yes. Hi, yeah, I'm still holding.

10:18.669 --> 10:20.327
Is this my stereo?

10:21.038 --> 10:22.901
Oh, hey, you got it.

10:22.973 --> 10:25.735
Hey, what happened to my stereo?
It's all smashed up.

10:25.809 --> 10:29.072
That's right. Now it looks
like it was broken during shipping...

10:29.146 --> 10:31.237
and I insured it for $400.

10:31.315 --> 10:33.280
But you were supposed to
get me a refund.

10:33.350 --> 10:36.544
You can't get a refund.
Your warranty expired two years ago.

10:37.988 --> 10:41.114
So we're gonna make the post office
pay for my new stereo now?

10:41.191 --> 10:44.021
- It's a write-off for them.
- How is it a write-off?

10:44.094 --> 10:45.718
They just write it off.

10:46.229 --> 10:47.762
Write it off what?

10:47.831 --> 10:50.957
Jerry, all these big companies,
they write off everything.

10:51.568 --> 10:54.296
You don't even know
what a write-off is.

10:55.772 --> 10:58.432
- Do you?
- No, I don't.

10:58.642 --> 11:00.073
But they do.

11:00.143 --> 11:03.110
And they're the ones writing it off.

11:07.050 --> 11:09.482
I wish I had the last 20 seconds
of my life back.

11:09.553 --> 11:14.784
What? What? He doesn't have
one appointment this whole month?

11:14.858 --> 11:18.485
Oh, come on. I'm dying here, man.

11:18.562 --> 11:21.722
Hello? Hello?

11:24.601 --> 11:25.963
Still no luck?

11:26.036 --> 11:29.128
Jerry, that was Dr. Zimmerman.
I'm at the end of the alphabet.

11:29.206 --> 11:31.604
There's no Zorn or Zutroff?

11:31.675 --> 11:35.302
They're on vacation. Every doctor
in this city seems to know who I am.

11:35.612 --> 11:37.339
Hey, what about Dr. Resnick?

11:37.414 --> 11:39.311
My Uncle Leo's
gonna see him tomorrow.

11:39.383 --> 11:42.145
Dr. Resnick. He's not listed.

11:42.219 --> 11:44.082
He's not that good.

11:44.154 --> 11:46.779
Elaine said you were
pretty good at this stuff.

11:46.857 --> 11:50.290
Oh, yeah. Elaine was a fun project.
I enjoyed working with her.

11:51.695 --> 11:54.127
- You don't have your own camera?
- No.

11:54.898 --> 11:56.590
Oh, boy, look at this.

11:56.667 --> 11:58.962
Yeah. Okay.

11:59.036 --> 12:00.569
This looks good.

12:00.637 --> 12:02.227
Very, very, good.

12:02.305 --> 12:03.997
And I like what you're wearing.

12:04.307 --> 12:06.898
- I feel fat.
- No, no. You're stout.

12:06.977 --> 12:08.806
The camera loves stoutness.

12:09.312 --> 12:12.643
Look, we're not gonna do anything
that makes you feel uncomfortable.

12:12.716 --> 12:15.080
The key word is "tasteful."

12:15.152 --> 12:18.813
Now, I want to you relax and have fun
because you're a fun guy.

12:20.290 --> 12:22.187
All right. Let's do it, huh?

12:22.259 --> 12:25.726
Yeah. Yeah.

12:26.196 --> 12:29.493
Okay. Come on. Feel the beat.

12:29.566 --> 12:32.692
Feel the beat. All right.

12:32.769 --> 12:36.737
You know, you got real strong pecs,
but it's hard to tell under that T-shirt.

12:36.807 --> 12:40.206
- You want me to take it off?
- Well, I don't know. It's up to you.

12:40.277 --> 12:43.141
- It would be better if I did?
- Might be. Whatever you want.

12:43.213 --> 12:46.248
- All right. Come on.
- Yeah.

12:46.316 --> 12:49.442
That's it. Come on, George.
That's it. Come on. Give it to me.

12:49.519 --> 12:52.053
Come on. Work it.
Work it. Oh, yeah.

12:52.122 --> 12:56.022
Hold it. Hold it.
Yeah, be a man. Be a man.

12:56.093 --> 12:59.060
Lover boy. You are a lover boy.

12:59.129 --> 13:01.697
Oh, yeah. This can't miss.

13:11.408 --> 13:12.736
Hello?

13:12.809 --> 13:15.241
Is this Elaine Marie Benes?

13:15.312 --> 13:18.142
Yeah. Who's this?

13:18.215 --> 13:22.183
We're with the American Medical
Association, the AMA.

13:22.252 --> 13:25.219
Can you confirm the correct spelling
of your last name?

13:25.288 --> 13:27.583
Is it B-E-N-E-S?

13:28.258 --> 13:31.589
Yeah. What is this about?

13:31.661 --> 13:33.228
Goodbye.

13:34.097 --> 13:35.789
Hello?

13:35.866 --> 13:37.831
- Hello?
- What?

13:39.269 --> 13:41.667
Get off the line.
We're trying to make another call.

13:41.738 --> 13:43.965
Oh, sorry.

13:49.646 --> 13:52.180
Elaine. Hello.
What are you doing here?

13:52.449 --> 13:55.780
- Leo, has the doctor been in yet?
- No, I'll ask him about my eyebrows.

13:55.852 --> 13:59.080
Okay. Listen, Leo.
You're hairless, you're scared.

13:59.156 --> 14:03.124
When the doctor comes in, you just
let me do the talking, okay? Okay.

14:03.426 --> 14:06.290
Leo. I understand
you had a little mishap.

14:06.363 --> 14:08.260
It was a fireball.

14:08.331 --> 14:11.093
I never should have left him alone.

14:11.168 --> 14:16.638
- And who are you?
- I'm his nurse. Paloma.

14:16.706 --> 14:19.297
You're not my nurse.

14:19.543 --> 14:22.908
He has good days and bad.

14:22.979 --> 14:24.637
Well, what seems to be the problem?

14:24.714 --> 14:29.114
- Are my eyebrows gonna grow back?
- And he seems to have a bit of a rash.

14:29.386 --> 14:31.078
- Really?
- Yeah.

14:31.488 --> 14:35.388
Well, there's been a bit of that
going around lately.

14:35.525 --> 14:37.752
Will you excuse me
a minute, Paloma?

14:37.828 --> 14:40.590
I'm just going to get some ointment.

14:44.067 --> 14:45.964
I don't like this. This is too easy.

14:46.036 --> 14:49.264
- Elaine...
- Shut up. I think he's onto us.

14:50.707 --> 14:52.707
Elaine, what about my eyebrows?

14:52.776 --> 14:54.309
Here. Here.

14:56.913 --> 14:58.674
I don't like this, Kramer.

14:59.482 --> 15:01.209
Will it be much longer?

15:01.284 --> 15:04.080
I'm sorry. It looks like the claim
has been red-flagged.

15:04.154 --> 15:05.846
You're under investigation.

15:05.922 --> 15:08.616
- Investigation?
- Hello, Jerry.

15:10.460 --> 15:12.289
Hello, Newman.

15:12.362 --> 15:16.592
Kramer, you might as well
run along.

15:16.666 --> 15:18.461
Jerry may be a while.

15:18.535 --> 15:21.399
Suspicion of mail fraud.

15:21.471 --> 15:22.902
Mail fraud?

15:22.973 --> 15:25.439
You're in a lot of trouble, buddy.

15:28.712 --> 15:31.246
Okay, I've got your ointment.
Where's your...

15:31.314 --> 15:34.042
- Where's your nurse?
- She left.

15:34.651 --> 15:37.948
Whoa, whoa, no need to get angry.

15:38.021 --> 15:40.749
- Calm down.
- I am calm.

15:40.824 --> 15:42.755
Leo, I don't care for your demeanor.

15:42.826 --> 15:44.484
Demeanor?

15:44.761 --> 15:46.556
Well, now you're just being difficult.

15:46.863 --> 15:48.794
What are you writing?

15:49.866 --> 15:55.427
So I really liked the pictures
I picked up here yesterday.

15:55.872 --> 15:57.200
I'm glad, George.

15:57.274 --> 15:59.740
And here's a little roll...

15:59.809 --> 16:02.377
that I think you may enjoy.

16:02.512 --> 16:03.840
Great.

16:03.914 --> 16:06.107
Shall we say an hour?

16:11.655 --> 16:13.746
Ron, I gotta go to lunch.
Could you do a roll?

16:14.090 --> 16:15.851
No problem.

16:15.926 --> 16:18.620
By the way, you know that model
who's always in here?

16:18.695 --> 16:20.888
She's missing
one of her lingerie shots.

16:20.964 --> 16:23.760
- Have you seen it?
- No.

16:23.833 --> 16:25.730
All right. All right.

16:27.671 --> 16:30.069
Then let me ask you this:

16:31.374 --> 16:35.137
Don't you find it interesting
that your friend had the foresight...

16:35.211 --> 16:38.371
to purchase postal insurance
for your stereo? Huh?

16:38.448 --> 16:41.608
I mean, parcels are rarely
damaged during shipping.

16:41.985 --> 16:45.282
- Define "rarely."
- Frequently.

16:46.856 --> 16:48.981
Are we about
through here, Newman?

16:50.193 --> 16:54.093
It's pretty hot
under these lights, huh, Seinfeld?

16:54.364 --> 16:57.558
Pretty hot.

17:00.103 --> 17:01.636
Actually, I'm quite comfortable.

17:08.243 --> 17:10.642
- Can I have a sip?
- No.

17:12.615 --> 17:15.275
Not gonna play ball, huh?

17:15.352 --> 17:17.146
All right. Admit it.

17:17.220 --> 17:19.481
That stereo was already busted.

17:19.556 --> 17:21.419
You can't prove anything.

17:21.491 --> 17:24.252
Is this or is this not your signature?

17:24.694 --> 17:26.659
No, as a matter of fact, it isn't.

17:29.699 --> 17:31.562
"Uncle Leo"?

17:33.470 --> 17:36.164
This case is closed
pending further evidence.

17:41.745 --> 17:43.107
Jerry!

17:45.749 --> 17:48.443
Get in there, get the chart,
and get out. You got it?

17:48.518 --> 17:50.677
No problem.
Listen, let me borrow your scarf.

17:50.754 --> 17:52.549
- What? This?
- Yeah. It's nice. Yeah.

17:52.989 --> 17:55.785
- Here.
- Yeah. All right.

17:56.393 --> 17:58.358
- One chart coming up.
- Okay.

17:58.428 --> 18:00.018
It's Bennett, right?

18:00.096 --> 18:02.027
It's Benes, you jackass.

18:02.098 --> 18:04.189
My last name is Benes.

18:06.102 --> 18:07.635
Yeah.

18:09.406 --> 18:11.167
Jerry. Jerry.

18:11.241 --> 18:14.071
Jerry. Jerry. Jerry.

18:15.612 --> 18:18.237
Jerry. Jerry?

18:20.650 --> 18:23.116
Jerry.

18:23.953 --> 18:26.351
So I like what you've done there.

18:28.458 --> 18:30.082
- May I help you?
- Yes, yes.

18:30.160 --> 18:33.991
I'm Dr. Van Nostrund
from the clinic.

18:34.064 --> 18:36.189
I'm gonna need Elaine Benes' chart.

18:36.266 --> 18:39.335
She's a patient of mine...

18:39.736 --> 18:42.327
and I don't think
she's gonna make it. It's very bad.

18:42.405 --> 18:45.065
Very, very messy.

18:45.141 --> 18:47.175
I see. And what clinic is that again?

18:47.477 --> 18:49.272
That's correct.

18:50.280 --> 18:53.543
- Excuse me?
- From the Hoffermandorf Neo Clinic...

18:53.616 --> 18:55.946
- in Belgium.
- Oh, really?

18:56.352 --> 18:57.680
The Netherlands?

19:01.458 --> 19:03.389
- Where's my chart? Did you get it?
- No.

19:03.460 --> 19:05.118
- What? What happened?
- I don't know.

19:05.195 --> 19:06.523
Now they got a chart on me.

19:07.730 --> 19:09.695
I don't know where they could be.

19:09.766 --> 19:11.356
You can't find them.

19:11.434 --> 19:12.762
That's marvelous.

19:12.836 --> 19:15.063
The dance continues.

19:15.338 --> 19:17.201
Well, if I find them I'll call you.

19:17.273 --> 19:20.934
Great. And maybe we could
go out and do something.

19:21.010 --> 19:22.577
Sure.

19:25.815 --> 19:27.314
Hello.

19:30.587 --> 19:32.211
Hi.

19:39.529 --> 19:43.224
- So the little guy finally asked me out.
- Really?

19:43.299 --> 19:45.560
Hey, I can't find
his photos anywhere.

19:45.635 --> 19:48.499
You know what? Some guy from
the post office confiscated them.

19:48.571 --> 19:49.899
He left his card.

19:54.444 --> 19:56.671
I don't know what Newman
wanted to see me for.

19:57.046 --> 19:59.614
Gentlemen. Gentlemen.

19:59.682 --> 20:03.479
I'm so happy to see you both.

20:03.553 --> 20:06.781
There's just some inconsistencies
I'd like to straighten out.

20:06.856 --> 20:11.017
- I'm clean, Newman, and you know it.
- Clean? Hardly.

20:13.296 --> 20:14.954
This doesn't look like a man...

20:15.031 --> 20:18.794
who's happy with his stereo
performance, now, does it?

20:18.868 --> 20:20.993
- Where did you get that?
- That's one of mine.

20:21.070 --> 20:24.936
Looks like you're breaking into it
like an otter cracks open a clam.

20:25.441 --> 20:27.839
I don't know about that,
but there's an explanation.

20:27.911 --> 20:31.708
Yes. It's called "mail fraud."

20:32.148 --> 20:35.149
How I've longed
for this moment, Seinfeld.

20:35.218 --> 20:37.445
The day when I would have
the proof I needed...

20:37.520 --> 20:40.020
to haul you out of your cushy lair...

20:40.089 --> 20:44.421
and expose you to the light of justice
as the monster that you are.

20:44.494 --> 20:47.529
- A monster so vile...
- Newman!

20:50.166 --> 20:53.394
There'll be a small fine.

20:53.469 --> 20:55.196
Okay.

20:55.271 --> 20:59.865
- Can we go now?
- Not so fast, pretty boy.

21:01.010 --> 21:05.479
There's more to this
sordid little affair.

21:10.987 --> 21:13.180
Oh, my God.

21:13.256 --> 21:15.916
This photo clearly indicates
your involvement...

21:15.992 --> 21:20.756
in some ill-conceived
mail-order pornography ring.

21:20.830 --> 21:26.800
As does this one,
found in the same disturbing packet.

21:29.739 --> 21:31.932
Oh, my God!

21:32.208 --> 21:36.108
We have a few questions
we'd like you to answer.

21:36.179 --> 21:39.248
I have a few questions of my own.

21:39.716 --> 21:41.249
Hi. One of your mailmen...

21:42.685 --> 21:45.117
Oh, my God. George.

21:45.188 --> 21:47.722
Well, Sheila, it's not what you think.

21:47.790 --> 21:49.755
I put my trust in the wrong person.

21:49.826 --> 21:52.895
He said the key word was "tasteful."

21:53.796 --> 21:56.694
The timeless art of seduction.

22:10.013 --> 22:12.206
Oh, gee.

22:12.515 --> 22:14.879
That wasn't such a long drive.

22:15.084 --> 22:16.811
The dirt road really hurt my back.

22:16.886 --> 22:19.386
Okay, please,
everybody just stop complaining.

22:19.455 --> 22:21.750
Smile. We're good patients.

22:21.824 --> 22:24.552
Okay, Miss Benes,
you wanna come on back?

22:24.627 --> 22:27.059
- Oh, I'd love to.
- Oh, just a second.

22:27.130 --> 22:28.959
- Okay.
- Hello.

22:29.198 --> 22:30.788
Yes.

22:30.867 --> 22:33.765
Well, as a matter of fact,
they're here right now.

22:35.071 --> 22:36.661
I understand.
