00:01.400 --> 00:03.846
Previously on Marvel's
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:03.920 --> 00:04.921
A hard drive?

00:05.000 --> 00:06.570
It's all the research
our team's ever done,

00:06.640 --> 00:07.721
encrypted for safekeeping.

00:07.800 --> 00:09.928
I'll give you 24 hours to get
the password and get out.

00:10.000 --> 00:11.684
After that, bring the girl to me.

00:11.760 --> 00:13.205
You don't have to shut people out.

00:13.280 --> 00:14.247
Yeah, I do.

00:14.320 --> 00:15.401
Eric?

00:16.440 --> 00:18.488
- There are things about me

00:18.560 --> 00:20.927
that you wouldn't like
if you knew.

00:21.040 --> 00:23.168
He's HYDRA.

00:23.240 --> 00:25.049
You all right? Why'd you leave?

00:30.440 --> 00:32.567
I'm good. I want this.

00:32.640 --> 00:34.961
I just got word from Fitz.
We need to go right now.

00:36.080 --> 00:38.287
- Where's our bus?
- And our team?

00:38.360 --> 00:39.361
I don't know.

00:52.120 --> 00:54.009
Yeah, it went as expected.

00:54.080 --> 00:57.323
S.H.I.E.L.D. implodes,
and everyone wants answers.

00:57.400 --> 01:01.724
The CIA, NSA, NRO, them I can handle.

01:01.800 --> 01:02.881
But Congress?

01:03.000 --> 01:05.321
Congress is like kindergarten.

01:05.400 --> 01:08.244
"Where is this Fridge?
What was in there?

01:08.320 --> 01:10.766
"Who or what is a Man-Thing?"

01:10.880 --> 01:13.326
I swear, I need a cocktail
and a lobotomy.

01:16.480 --> 01:20.769
But, apparently, my every move
continues to fascinate them.

01:20.840 --> 01:24.162
Tonight's standard-issue
surveillance package includes

01:24.240 --> 01:27.767
fake yuppie not checking
her texts at the bus stop,

01:27.840 --> 01:31.083
imposter homeless man,
mildly offensive,

01:31.160 --> 01:33.401
and the hipster following me
looks familiar.

01:33.480 --> 01:35.130
I think he's Russian, or...

01:36.680 --> 01:37.806
Gone.

01:43.040 --> 01:44.530
Pepper, I'll call you back in 10.

01:50.520 --> 01:52.170
We need to talk, Agent Hill.

01:52.240 --> 01:53.810
May-

01:54.240 --> 01:58.529
A phone call would've done it,
but I appreciate the discretion.

01:58.600 --> 01:59.806
Thought you'd like the night off.

01:59.880 --> 02:02.850
They must hate that
you're going to work for Stark.

02:02.920 --> 02:06.288
Most of the intelligence community
would like to drop me into a dark hole.

02:06.360 --> 02:08.840
But even they can't mess with
Tony's army of lawyers.

02:08.919 --> 02:12.766
So, for now, we're privatizing
global security. Wanna join?

02:12.840 --> 02:17.050
Coulson needs help.
And he won't take it from me anymore.

02:18.840 --> 02:20.604
- Where is he?
-Providence base.

02:20.680 --> 02:22.330
And he's got enough to worry about

02:22.400 --> 02:24.767
without obsessing over T.A.H.I.T.I.
and who covered it up.

02:24.840 --> 02:26.604
You mean besides us?

02:28.120 --> 02:30.646
- How much does he know?
-Enough.

02:30.720 --> 02:33.963
That they used alien biology,
rewrote his memories,

02:34.040 --> 02:36.042
and that Fury did it under
someone else's direction.

02:36.120 --> 02:37.565
I wanna know who that was.

02:37.640 --> 02:39.369
You're afraid it was Alexander Pierce?

02:39.440 --> 02:41.283
Secretary Pierce
was the man in charge,

02:41.360 --> 02:44.762
the only person Fury took orders
from, and he was HYDRA.

02:44.840 --> 02:47.002
Having a man like that
design your brain?

02:47.080 --> 02:48.491
You can understand my concern.

02:48.600 --> 02:52.321
Fury took his cues from pretty
high up, that much I know.

02:52.440 --> 02:54.408
But when I asked him who it was,

02:54.480 --> 02:56.369
Fury said he buried that intel

02:56.440 --> 02:58.920
when he decided not to bury Coulson.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.082
Maria, this is not the time to wax poetic.

03:01.200 --> 03:02.406
Those are his words, not mine.

03:02.800 --> 03:05.451
You knew the man,
sometimes he spoke in riddles.

03:05.920 --> 03:09.720
Guess I'll have to solve it, then.
Unless you wanna ask Fury for me.

03:09.800 --> 03:11.404
Fury's dead.

03:12.880 --> 03:14.211
I'll believe it when I see it.

03:18.440 --> 03:19.441
Drop your weapon!

03:19.520 --> 03:22.285
Three minutes and 20 seconds. Really?

03:22.360 --> 03:25.842
If you were my agents,
it wouldn't be for long.

03:33.800 --> 03:34.847
Play it again.

03:34.920 --> 03:36.843
It's the same every time, sir.

03:37.480 --> 03:38.481
Fitz.

03:39.640 --> 03:42.723
As I said, all internal
camera feeds were erased.

03:42.800 --> 03:46.202
But the hangar's landing
assist system is separate.

03:46.320 --> 03:47.924
The camera tracks movement.

03:48.040 --> 03:51.806
So after we left,
everything's normal until this.

03:53.160 --> 03:55.401
An entry log has May leaving the base

03:55.480 --> 03:59.041
a few minutes later through
the front door. Only her.

03:59.800 --> 04:01.450
And then, this.

04:02.160 --> 04:03.446
Holding hands.

04:03.520 --> 04:07.764
Soon after, the plane takes off.
That is all we've got.

04:07.840 --> 04:09.968
Where are they going? And Koenig?

04:10.040 --> 04:12.122
Koenig must have
gotten onto the plane somehow.

04:12.200 --> 04:13.565
There's no other way in or out.

04:13.640 --> 04:16.404
The blast door and the hangar door
are the only exits.

04:16.480 --> 04:18.005
And both are undamaged.

04:18.079 --> 04:19.730
So nobody attacked the place,

04:19.800 --> 04:21.529
and they weren't running away.
So why?

04:21.600 --> 04:24.524
- Maybe Koenig got orders.
-From who? Not Fury.

04:24.600 --> 04:26.728
Is there anyone left to give orders?

04:26.800 --> 04:28.768
Aren't we just improvising at this point?

04:28.840 --> 04:31.207
Still wouldn't explain why
the communication lines were cut.

04:31.280 --> 04:34.807
Or why they left their phones.
Or why May just left.

04:34.920 --> 04:37.571
May walked away because I told her to.

04:37.640 --> 04:39.483
I was mad and I was mean.

04:39.560 --> 04:41.528
Then we don't need her sorry ass.

04:41.600 --> 04:42.647
Excuse me?

04:42.760 --> 04:43.921
With all the crap we're facing,

04:44.000 --> 04:46.287
this is not the time to
pull the rip cord, bail out.

04:46.360 --> 04:49.250
I'll make us some food. We have to eat.

04:49.320 --> 04:52.210
- Let me help.
-No, I'll get it, actually. You stay here.

04:54.600 --> 04:55.931
Simmons.

04:57.680 --> 05:01.127
For a minute there in the field, I thought
things were normal again, and then...

05:01.200 --> 05:03.248
Why do you think
they left us in the dark?

05:03.320 --> 05:04.321
I don't know.

05:04.400 --> 05:07.051
But something will turn up.
We just have to stay positive.

05:07.160 --> 05:10.323
For Coulson, yeah. I know.
He's had a rough go of it.

05:10.400 --> 05:14.041
Yeah. Between Garrett, and May,
and seeing Audrey and...

05:14.120 --> 05:15.201
Pancakes.

05:15.600 --> 05:17.728
Coulson's upset about pancakes now?

05:17.800 --> 05:20.565
That's one way to cheer
everyone up a bit, don't you think?

05:20.640 --> 05:22.085
I'll see if we have any in stock.

05:22.160 --> 05:24.083
Yeah, I'll fire up the griddle.

05:34.560 --> 05:36.244
Night?

05:36.760 --> 05:37.761
Day?

05:47.320 --> 05:49.641
Sir, you're an expert on analysis.

05:49.720 --> 05:54.044
I can see you running scenarios in your
head, so what do you got?

05:54.120 --> 05:56.088
Best case?

05:56.160 --> 05:58.288
Agent Koenig
knows something we don't.

05:59.120 --> 06:02.442
Took a team.
Kept us in the dark for our safety.

06:15.960 --> 06:17.121
And worst-case scenario?

06:20.800 --> 06:23.167
We've had a wolf in the herd
the whole time.

07:02.400 --> 07:04.846
- Fitz keeps the candy under his bunk.

07:05.200 --> 07:06.326
What are you up to?

07:06.400 --> 07:09.529
I'm just looking for the
sat-phone to call the team.

07:09.600 --> 07:12.729
Make sure everyone's all right,
no one's blown up.

07:12.800 --> 07:14.962
I got the phone. I just talked to Coulson
a little while ago.

07:15.080 --> 07:16.491
- You did?
-Yeah.

07:16.560 --> 07:18.528
Sorry. Should've told you. They're okay.

07:18.600 --> 07:21.649
But, the sooner we get to the location,
decrypt that drive...

07:21.720 --> 07:23.290
The sooner we can
rendezvous with the team.

07:23.360 --> 07:25.203
Exactly.

07:26.320 --> 07:30.211
Seemed like a smart play at
the time, geo-locking the drive.

07:30.720 --> 07:32.802
I didn't think it'd backfire on us.

07:32.880 --> 07:34.325
It hasn't backfired.

07:34.400 --> 07:35.970
The drive is supposed to be
impossible to crack.

07:38.360 --> 07:40.806
Pretty specific coordinates, though.

07:40.880 --> 07:42.166
You could've picked
anywhere in the world.

07:42.240 --> 07:44.720
Why a random diner in L.A.?

07:47.120 --> 07:50.044
It was already built into my encryption,
never changed it.

07:50.120 --> 07:53.249
But it's fitting.
It's where I met Mike Peterson.

07:53.320 --> 07:57.530
It's where this whole S.H.I.E.L.D.
roller coaster started.

07:57.600 --> 07:59.728
Plus, tactically,
what do you look for in a drop site?

08:00.240 --> 08:02.049
Public place, lots of people,
multiple exits.

08:02.120 --> 08:05.090
Yep. Figured if I ever got in trouble,
I'd be safe there.

08:06.360 --> 08:07.725
You'll be plenty safe.

08:13.920 --> 08:16.969
This, however, is not the answer.

08:18.240 --> 08:21.130
What's the matter,
a girl can't defend herself?

08:21.200 --> 08:22.884
In this situation,
the last thing we can afford

08:22.960 --> 08:25.884
is to get pinched on
a concealed weapons charge.

08:27.040 --> 08:29.042
You're right, again.

08:30.080 --> 08:32.890
I couldn't find any rounds anyway.

08:33.760 --> 08:34.885
Hey-

08:35.720 --> 08:36.721
We are gonna be okay.

08:38.440 --> 08:41.205
I promise, until this thing is over,

08:41.280 --> 08:43.567
I'm not gonna let you out of my sight.

08:52.320 --> 08:54.971
Impossible. It can't be.

08:57.160 --> 08:58.844
No. I don't believe it.

08:58.920 --> 09:00.410
Take a breath, Agent Fitz.

09:00.480 --> 09:04.280
Don't tell me to take a breath.
Who the hell are you?

09:05.080 --> 09:07.162
I mean, really, come on.
I don't even know who you are.

09:07.240 --> 09:08.924
- I just went through this, remember?
-Don't touch me.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.650
My S.O. turned out
to be a lying son of a bitch.

09:10.720 --> 09:13.007
Not Ward, okay? Not Ward.

09:13.080 --> 09:15.048
Do you know why?
Because he's our friend.

09:15.120 --> 09:17.726
And Simmons will find something.
Go on, tell them, Jemma.

09:17.800 --> 09:19.928
- Let me work, Fitz.
-Yeah, but tell them that Ward is a...

09:20.000 --> 09:21.968
Let me work.

09:22.080 --> 09:24.606
Something else is at play here, sir.

09:24.680 --> 09:26.409
Think about it. They're just
trying to mess with our heads.

09:26.480 --> 09:27.481
They wrote that on the wall to scare us.

09:27.560 --> 09:29.244
- One step at a time.
-We need to get out of here.

09:29.320 --> 09:32.324
Simmons will give her report.
That's the next step.

09:34.480 --> 09:38.201
He died approximately
10 hours ago of asphyxiation,

09:38.280 --> 09:40.647
after May left the premises.

09:41.720 --> 09:44.644
A thin wire was used to strangle him.

09:44.720 --> 09:47.690
His trachea is crushed,
partially sliced through.

09:47.760 --> 09:49.683
So it was done in a hurry.

09:50.640 --> 09:54.440
Based on the angle of the lacerations,

09:54.520 --> 09:57.126
the killer was at least 6'2".

09:57.240 --> 10:01.643
And strong enough to lift him into...

10:05.720 --> 10:06.881
Ward did this.

10:09.680 --> 10:10.886
Fitz!

10:11.480 --> 10:13.164
No, no, no, don't!

10:13.520 --> 10:14.851
Okay, okay!

10:14.920 --> 10:17.321
We need to hold it together.

10:17.400 --> 10:19.050
Listen.

10:20.320 --> 10:21.731
All that anger,

10:21.800 --> 10:26.010
all that pain, you need to hold it in
and focus it on Skye.

10:26.080 --> 10:27.650
She's alive.

10:27.720 --> 10:29.210
And she just walked out of here

10:29.280 --> 10:31.567
hand in hand with someone
she knows is a murderer,

10:31.640 --> 10:33.847
because she's playing him.

10:33.920 --> 10:35.285
Just like he played us.

10:36.280 --> 10:38.442
Fitz. Fitz.

10:39.520 --> 10:41.761
We have to fix the communications.

10:41.840 --> 10:44.286
We have to track that plane.
Can you do that?

10:48.440 --> 10:50.044
Good.

10:50.120 --> 10:52.088
If I know Skye, she's got a plan.

10:52.160 --> 10:56.609
And we're gonna find her before
Ward figures out what that is.

11:05.040 --> 11:06.451
Come on, Skye.

11:06.560 --> 11:08.562
What's your play?

11:10.600 --> 11:13.763
Can't remember the last time
I sat in a restaurant.

11:13.840 --> 11:16.161
I know. It's been all tubes,
tunnels and plane food.

11:16.240 --> 11:18.049
Maybe I'll get pie for dessert.

11:18.120 --> 11:19.121
Dessert?

11:19.920 --> 11:21.809
I was hoping we'd be done
by the time I finished coffee.

11:21.880 --> 11:24.121
You have any idea how long it'll take
to decrypt this drive?

11:24.200 --> 11:25.611
For you? I figured 10 minutes.

11:25.680 --> 11:26.761
Not even close.

11:26.840 --> 11:29.446
The GPS will take a hot second
to calibrate,

11:29.520 --> 11:30.646
but I'm working on a laptop,

11:30.720 --> 11:33.564
so even at three cycles per byte,
there are still terabytes of data...

11:33.640 --> 11:35.324
Spare me the details.
Give me the time frame.

11:35.400 --> 11:37.209
An hour would be a miracle.

11:37.280 --> 11:39.089
Coulson needs this yesterday.

11:39.160 --> 11:43.006
My laptop's not a time machine, Ward.
That's the science.

11:47.800 --> 11:49.962
I guess we're having dessert.

11:52.680 --> 11:55.923
Can you grab me a cable?
I think there's one in the drawer.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.331
Thanks.

12:05.120 --> 12:06.167
That seemed to work.

12:06.240 --> 12:09.084
Fitz is using the Jumpjet's
relay to power it.

12:09.160 --> 12:10.207
He's like a ninja with this crap.

12:10.280 --> 12:12.442
- How's he doing?
-Freaking out.

12:12.520 --> 12:15.649
But focused on the task,
which was good advice. And you?

12:15.720 --> 12:18.007
Trust me, I'm gonna have
a major freak-out later.

12:20.200 --> 12:23.886
All right. Ward is HYDRA.
You know what that means.

12:23.960 --> 12:26.201
- Garrett is alive.
-And Agent Hand is dead.

12:26.280 --> 12:27.361
So they hit the Fridge.

12:27.440 --> 12:29.283
And they took out all the weapons
they could possibly want.

12:29.360 --> 12:32.842
And we didn't have a clue.
So why risk coming back here?

12:32.920 --> 12:36.811
It wasn't to cross us off.
What do you have that he wants?

12:36.880 --> 12:39.963
I don't know.
He had all our intel on that drive.

12:40.040 --> 12:42.407
All he had to do was make a copy...

12:44.200 --> 12:45.850
He came back for Skye.

12:45.920 --> 12:47.922
She must have encrypted that drive.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.162
And she was the only one
who could crack back into it.

12:50.240 --> 12:53.130
- So they have to keep her alive.
-And she can stall for time.

12:54.280 --> 12:57.762
Our plane is in Los Angeles.
Finally, some good news.

12:57.880 --> 12:59.882
--Perimeter defenses activated.

13:00.640 --> 13:02.802
I should have knocked
on wood just then.

13:02.880 --> 13:05.042
Multiple contacts
on the ground.

13:05.120 --> 13:07.327
- They just triggered the gun turrets.
-Come on.

13:09.240 --> 13:10.730
- You're staring again.

13:12.080 --> 13:14.162
I'm not allowed to do that?

13:14.240 --> 13:17.403
I told you, it's a complicated hack.

13:20.720 --> 13:22.722
You're mistaking my admiration
for impatience.

13:22.800 --> 13:24.165
No, it's impatience.

13:25.520 --> 13:28.171
Okay. Sorry.
Didn't mean to stress you out.

13:28.240 --> 13:30.129
Maybe you should duck outside.

13:30.200 --> 13:32.885
Try again on the sat-phone,
just to make sure.

13:32.960 --> 13:36.487
No. We stick together,
we stick to the plan.

13:36.560 --> 13:37.846
The sooner you
decrypt this hard drive...

13:37.960 --> 13:39.769
The sooner we get to them.

13:39.880 --> 13:41.291
I heard you twice the first time.

13:52.640 --> 13:53.846
Are you all right?

13:55.800 --> 13:57.370
You look nervous.

13:58.640 --> 14:01.564
How can you tell, superspy?

14:01.640 --> 14:04.325
Staying unnaturally still
to keep from fidgeting.

14:04.400 --> 14:08.883
Maintaining eye contact to give
the impression of confidence.

14:08.960 --> 14:10.246
What's wrong?

14:14.760 --> 14:17.047
The last time I was in this booth,

14:17.120 --> 14:19.566
I was sitting across from Mike Peterson.

14:19.640 --> 14:22.166
A good man. And now he's a murderer.

14:22.240 --> 14:24.925
And we are FBI's most wanted.

14:25.960 --> 14:28.247
It's just like any moment

14:28.320 --> 14:30.402
something could go horribly wrong.

14:32.440 --> 14:34.966
Relax, you're doing great.

14:36.080 --> 14:37.411
Hiding what I'm thinking and feeling,

14:37.520 --> 14:39.488
it doesn't come as easy for me
as it does for you.

14:39.560 --> 14:40.766
Comes with experience.

14:40.840 --> 14:42.808
Yeah, I guess it does.

14:45.720 --> 14:48.371
- What can I get you guys?
- Some coffee.

14:57.200 --> 14:59.362
I wish this bunker
had a bunker.

14:59.440 --> 15:00.851
These doors should hold.

15:00.960 --> 15:03.566
It'll take some major artillery
to make a dent.

15:03.640 --> 15:05.165
Hangar door deactivated.

15:05.240 --> 15:07.288
How? That's impossible.

15:07.360 --> 15:09.328
Take cover. Let's go.

15:19.360 --> 15:21.727
It's not HYDRA. It's Special Forces.

15:21.840 --> 15:23.080
On behalf of the

15:23.160 --> 15:24.525
United States Armed Forces,

15:24.600 --> 15:26.841
I order you to stand down.

15:26.920 --> 15:29.810
I repeat, stand down-

15:29.880 --> 15:31.325
Colonel Talbot?

15:31.400 --> 15:35.200
There have to be better things for you to
do than chase four S.H.I.E.L.D. agents.

15:35.280 --> 15:39.524
I wasn't a huge fan before chasing
you to the damn tundra, Coulson.

15:39.600 --> 15:40.726
I wouldn't push it.

15:40.800 --> 15:42.564
I'm flattered you came in person.

15:44.560 --> 15:48.281
Fury's private base
on North American soil?

15:48.360 --> 15:50.931
I just had to see it for myself.

15:52.040 --> 15:53.690
If I come out, will you shoot me?

15:53.760 --> 15:55.489
'Cause then I won't come out.

15:55.600 --> 15:58.126
Hold your fire, soldiers.

16:03.120 --> 16:07.250
This is one of the most classified
facilities on the planet, Colonel.

16:07.360 --> 16:08.646
How the hell did you find it?

16:12.040 --> 16:13.280
I told them.

16:42.640 --> 16:43.766
My condolences.

17:12.920 --> 17:15.287
"T.A.H.I.T.I. Project Supervisor
to Director Fury."

17:21.160 --> 17:23.208
- We're not criminals.
- Great.

17:23.920 --> 17:27.128
Then we'll take you in,
you can tell us all about it.

17:27.880 --> 17:30.042
At the very least, you're fugitives.

17:30.120 --> 17:31.326
And running away

17:31.960 --> 17:35.248
puts a bit of a guilty stink on it,
don't you think?

17:35.320 --> 17:36.287
We're not HYDRA.

17:36.360 --> 17:37.771
We're Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

17:37.840 --> 17:41.162
Well right now, to the rest of the world,
that's the same thing.

17:47.800 --> 17:51.043
All right, I'm gonna tell you
how it's gonna be.

17:51.120 --> 17:53.009
You give me actionable intelligence,

17:53.480 --> 17:56.563
and I'll allow you
to serve time rewarded.

17:56.640 --> 18:00.167
Your other option's pretty much hell.

18:00.240 --> 18:01.287
Do your worst.

18:01.360 --> 18:04.921
We told you of a known HYDRA agent.
He's getting away.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.490
And your little intimidation speech

18:06.560 --> 18:09.928
is keeping us from saving
the life of a fellow agent.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.047
A friend.

18:11.120 --> 18:14.442
Sister, you haven't seen intimidation.
And right now I'm your only friend.

18:14.520 --> 18:16.568
I'd be careful not to piss me off.

18:16.640 --> 18:21.009
The word "agent" implies that
your corrupt organization still exists.

18:21.120 --> 18:23.327
Your leadership abandoned you
for the private sector.

18:23.400 --> 18:24.606
And we're gonna allow that

18:24.680 --> 18:26.444
in exchange
for valuable assets like yourself.

18:26.520 --> 18:29.091
So right now,
I'd be thinking hard and fast

18:29.160 --> 18:32.881
about exactly what it is that
makes you valuable.

18:34.040 --> 18:36.691
I am offering you
a lifeline here, Coulson.

18:36.800 --> 18:39.121
Don't thank me.
Just take it, and we'll be on our way.

18:39.200 --> 18:42.409
Don't see how thanks are in order,
considering you just sold me out

18:42.480 --> 18:45.165
and led the US military
straight to Fury's secret base.

18:45.240 --> 18:46.287
No, Phil.

18:46.360 --> 18:48.044
You led us straight to Fury's secret base

18:48.120 --> 18:50.202
as part of the deal we made.

18:50.760 --> 18:51.886
You can't be serious.

18:51.960 --> 18:53.610
You and I are gonna
turn over these abandoned tunnels

18:53.680 --> 18:54.727
to the US government,

18:54.800 --> 18:56.928
who will be ever so grateful
to take possession

18:57.000 --> 18:59.367
of an enemy stronghold
in their backyard.

18:59.440 --> 19:00.487
What about my team?

19:00.560 --> 19:02.369
They're gonna have to
go through the system.

19:02.440 --> 19:04.169
- Interrogation...
-Not gonna happen.

19:05.400 --> 19:07.402
Look, talk to Talbot.

19:07.480 --> 19:10.563
Cough up some meaningless intel
about this place.

19:10.640 --> 19:13.211
Nothing significant, of course,

19:13.280 --> 19:15.851
nothing about S.H.I.E.L.D.'s
other installations.

19:18.080 --> 19:20.321
You're still protecting your secrets.

19:21.240 --> 19:24.210
Is there anything specific you're afraid
I'll talk about? T.A.H.I.T.I., maybe?

19:24.280 --> 19:26.123
- Phil.
-I'm a liability? Is that it?

19:26.200 --> 19:29.966
Grow up, Phil.
Of course you're a liability.

19:30.040 --> 19:31.530
But I know you'll do the right thing.

19:31.600 --> 19:34.444
The right thing?
That's funny, coming from you.

19:34.520 --> 19:36.010
After everything
you and Fury have done.

19:36.080 --> 19:38.890
- Look, it was for...
-For my own good, I know. I get it.

19:39.840 --> 19:41.444
You should've been straight with me.

19:42.440 --> 19:45.250
I would've kept your secrets
like a good soldier. I always have.

19:45.320 --> 19:46.845
But, instead, you were worried
about me,

19:46.920 --> 19:48.604
when you should've been worried
about anyone else!

19:50.880 --> 19:54.680
You're right.
We should've seen HYDRA coming.

19:54.760 --> 19:56.444
But after DC, they don't stand a chance.

19:56.520 --> 19:59.251
- John Garrett does.
-Garrett? I heard Ward took care of him.

19:59.320 --> 20:00.651
Ward's his secret weapon.

20:01.160 --> 20:03.686
He killed Victoria Hand,
then raided the Fridge,

20:03.760 --> 20:04.966
and now he's got Skye.

20:05.040 --> 20:06.087
Which is where we were headed

20:06.160 --> 20:08.845
until you so rudely interrupted
to sweeten your deal.

20:12.120 --> 20:13.531
I vetted Ward.

20:13.600 --> 20:17.730
You wanna make this right?
Stop wasting time.

20:17.800 --> 20:19.370
Can we move this along?

20:19.440 --> 20:21.442
I'd like to tear this room apart.

20:21.520 --> 20:23.807
Sure, Colonel. Knock yourself out.

20:47.840 --> 20:50.127
- Get your people. We need to move.
-"We"?

20:55.640 --> 20:57.483
- How much longer?
-Half hour.

20:57.560 --> 21:00.086
You said that a half an hour ago.

21:00.160 --> 21:02.686
Weren't you the one
who told me to relax?

21:03.840 --> 21:06.525
Those cops over there
keep looking at us.

21:07.680 --> 21:09.489
They're just checking out the waitress.

21:10.000 --> 21:13.322
They don't know you're
pretending to be someone you're not.

21:14.480 --> 21:15.766
Yeah? All right.

21:15.840 --> 21:17.285
Who am I pretending to be?

21:18.240 --> 21:19.730
My impatient boyfriend.

21:19.840 --> 21:21.330
I like that cover.

21:30.400 --> 21:32.243
What's the longest
you've been undercover?

21:32.760 --> 21:34.922
Like, deep undercover?

21:35.000 --> 21:36.286
Uh...

21:36.360 --> 21:38.328
-16 months.
-When was that?

21:38.440 --> 21:40.408
Hmm, about five years
outside of the Academy.

21:40.480 --> 21:43.689
I posed as a Russian attaché
at the embassy in Warsaw.

21:43.760 --> 21:46.923
It's got to be so hard,
living a double life like that.

21:47.680 --> 21:50.251
Getting close to people
only to turn on them.

21:52.360 --> 21:54.283
I don't know how Garrett did it.

21:54.400 --> 21:55.401
Garrett?

21:55.480 --> 21:57.687
Think about all that time
he spent as your S.O.,

21:57.760 --> 22:00.206
getting to know you, being your mentor,

22:00.680 --> 22:04.685
only to lie to your face,
betray you like that.

22:05.880 --> 22:09.930
It was difficult to accept.
But, thankfully, that's over.

22:10.560 --> 22:11.846
Because you took care of him.

22:16.960 --> 22:18.041
Can we not discuss this right now?

22:18.120 --> 22:19.770
If you had one more moment,

22:19.840 --> 22:23.561
before you shot him in the back
of the head so heroically,

22:23.640 --> 22:26.041
if he was sitting right here,
and you could say anything you want,

22:26.120 --> 22:27.451
-what would you say?
-Skye!

22:27.520 --> 22:30.205
Would you say he's disgusting?

22:30.280 --> 22:34.285
Would you tell him
he's a disgusting, backstabbing traitor?

22:36.600 --> 22:38.762
Or to rot in hell?

22:41.440 --> 22:42.487
What are you doing?

22:42.560 --> 22:46.246
I'm just trying to have an
honest conversation for once.

22:46.320 --> 22:47.526
Excuse me, folks.

22:47.600 --> 22:49.841
Could I just ask you to
step out for a second?

22:50.440 --> 22:51.851
They're starting to clear people out.
We should go.

22:51.920 --> 22:55.208
- No, I think I'm good here.
-Skye, we've been made. Come on.

22:55.280 --> 22:57.282
No.

22:59.280 --> 23:01.487
I tipped them off.

23:06.280 --> 23:07.770
Hail HYDRA.

23:07.840 --> 23:09.888
- You two! Show me your hands, now!
-Get 'em up!

23:09.960 --> 23:11.849
Out of the booth, nice and slow.

23:14.200 --> 23:15.690
All right, turn around.
Hands on your head.

23:15.760 --> 23:17.524
Just be careful. He's armed.

23:33.120 --> 23:34.326
Skye!

23:34.840 --> 23:37.411
- Officers! I surrender, arrest me.
-Slow down, ma'am.

23:37.520 --> 23:39.249
- What are you talking about?
-I'm an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.,

23:39.320 --> 23:40.890
a wanted fugitive. Take me in.

23:40.960 --> 23:42.246
Come on, what are you doing?
Get me out of here!

23:42.320 --> 23:43.685
That's it! Come on!

23:45.360 --> 23:47.010
I'll do whatever you want,

23:47.080 --> 23:48.411
- but you should...

23:48.480 --> 23:50.164
Skye. Don't run.

23:51.240 --> 23:52.890
You don't understand! Look!

23:52.960 --> 23:55.327
I'm not trying to hurt you!

24:10.040 --> 24:12.008
You should be thanking me.
I saved your ass.

24:12.080 --> 24:16.290
You didn't save my ass.
You turned it into a public spectacle.

24:16.360 --> 24:18.124
You let her get one over on you.

24:18.200 --> 24:19.850
That's exactly what
Garrett was afraid of.

24:19.920 --> 24:21.570
And Garrett told you to stay out of sight.

24:21.640 --> 24:23.688
He ordered me to shadow you.

24:24.840 --> 24:26.365
He knew you had a soft spot for Skye

24:26.440 --> 24:27.805
and she might take advantage of it.

24:29.920 --> 24:32.764
Well, he was wrong. We have her.

24:33.440 --> 24:35.249
And once she gives us
the location, we'll be off.

24:35.320 --> 24:37.243
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

24:39.280 --> 24:41.487
Take a walk. I can handle this.

24:41.560 --> 24:44.564
Can you? You haven't so far.

24:47.080 --> 24:49.606
Garrett says you have five minutes.

24:56.560 --> 24:57.766
I can explain.

24:58.920 --> 25:01.287
Lying bastard! Son of a bitch!
You lying...

25:01.360 --> 25:03.761
- Stop! Stop!

25:04.760 --> 25:07.445
Okay? It's over. You can't win.

25:12.440 --> 25:13.601
- Stop.

25:22.760 --> 25:26.731
All this time,
everything we've been through.

25:26.800 --> 25:29.770
Why? How could you?

25:29.880 --> 25:32.281
I was on a mission.

25:32.360 --> 25:35.204
- It wasn't personal.
-"it wasn't. .

25:35.280 --> 25:38.284
You did not just say that.
"it wasn't personal"?

25:38.360 --> 25:39.805
Skye, listen to me.

25:39.880 --> 25:42.281
God, you might actually believe that.

25:43.280 --> 25:46.170
That is the twisted logic
that they teach you

25:46.240 --> 25:47.685
when you sign up to be a Nazi.

25:47.760 --> 25:50.081
Stop, wait. I'm not a Nazi.

25:50.160 --> 25:52.162
Yes, you are.

25:52.240 --> 25:53.924
That is exactly what you are.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.923
It's in the S.H.I.E.L.D. handbook,
Chapter 1.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.526
"The Red Skull, founder of HYDRA,

25:58.600 --> 26:00.443
"was a big fat freakin' Nazi."

26:00.520 --> 26:01.965
That has nothing to do with today.

26:02.080 --> 26:04.731
You know, you always
had that Hitler Youth look to you,

26:04.800 --> 26:06.484
so it's really not that surprising.

26:06.560 --> 26:09.689
It's not like that. I'm a spy. I had a job.

26:09.760 --> 26:12.411
You've killed
I don't know how many people.

26:12.480 --> 26:13.641
You gonna kill me now?

26:13.720 --> 26:16.200
No. I would never hurt you.

26:16.280 --> 26:17.361
Once I crack the drive,

26:17.440 --> 26:19.522
are you just going to shoot me
like you did with Thomas Nash?

26:19.640 --> 26:22.291
Or are you gonna have someone else
do it, like you did with Quinn?

26:22.360 --> 26:25.045
I didn't know that was gonna happen.
That was all Garrett.

26:25.120 --> 26:26.690
Of course it was Garrett's fault.

26:26.760 --> 26:28.489
It was part of the mission, right?

26:28.560 --> 26:30.130
You're just gonna kick back

26:30.200 --> 26:33.682
and watch me bleed until it's
your turn to pull the trigger.

26:35.160 --> 26:39.529
You think I had a part in that?
That I'd let that happen to you?

26:41.040 --> 26:42.883
You know how I feel about you, Skye.

26:45.240 --> 26:46.321
Wait.

26:47.360 --> 26:49.806
So even though you've been lying

26:51.080 --> 26:53.890
to everyone about everything,

26:55.720 --> 26:57.165
you're saying that your feelings for me...

26:57.240 --> 26:58.730
They're real, Skye.

27:00.080 --> 27:01.570
They always have been.

27:06.400 --> 27:07.890
I'm gonna throw up.

27:13.720 --> 27:16.724
You think this has been easy for me?

27:16.800 --> 27:19.087
Do you have any idea how hard it was?

27:20.200 --> 27:23.363
The sacrifices, the decisions
I had to make? But I made them.

27:23.440 --> 27:27.445
Because that's what I do. I'm a survivor.

27:27.840 --> 27:29.888
You are a serial killer.

27:31.320 --> 27:32.651
And you know what?

27:33.960 --> 27:37.123
You were right about one thing.

27:37.200 --> 27:40.124
I wouldn't like the real you.

27:41.560 --> 27:45.087
Someday, you'll understand.

27:45.160 --> 27:47.367
No, I won't.

27:48.960 --> 27:52.681
And I will never, ever

27:53.520 --> 27:56.251
give you what you want.

28:31.920 --> 28:32.887
Ow!

28:36.280 --> 28:37.645
Time's up.

28:37.720 --> 28:41.805
You can tell me where to unlock
the drive, or you can tell him.

28:44.680 --> 28:45.966
Mike.

28:47.640 --> 28:49.961
Please. I know you don't wanna do this.

28:50.080 --> 28:52.162
-It's not up to me.
-Yes, it is.

28:52.240 --> 28:53.401
I don't care what they did to you.

28:53.480 --> 28:55.130
You're still Mike Peterson.

28:55.200 --> 28:57.521
You're still a father. You have a son.

28:57.600 --> 28:59.648
Who I left in your hands.

29:00.600 --> 29:02.841
I asked you to look after him, Skye.
Where is he now?

29:02.920 --> 29:05.446
He's with his aunt, under the protection
of a S.H.I.E.L.D. team.

29:05.520 --> 29:07.409
And what is S.H.I.E.L.D. today?

29:07.480 --> 29:09.926
HYDRA can hurt my son
anytime they want.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.606
And if I get any funny ideas
about rescuing him,

29:12.680 --> 29:15.206
they push a little button
and blow a hole in my skull.

29:15.280 --> 29:17.521
- Fitz-Simmons will figure out a way...
-No.

29:18.520 --> 29:19.851
There's no way out of this, Skye.

29:21.360 --> 29:24.728
Tell us how to unlock the drive.

29:27.560 --> 29:28.925
- No.
-Damn it, Skye.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.890
You could've shot me back in Italy,
but you didn't.

29:31.960 --> 29:34.566
They made Quinn do it because
there's still good in you, Mike.

29:34.640 --> 29:37.405
And I don't think you're gonna hurt me.

29:40.200 --> 29:43.682
You're right. I won't hurt you.

29:50.880 --> 29:53.281
What did you do to him?

29:53.360 --> 29:54.566
Stopped his heart.

29:54.640 --> 29:56.324
- His heart...
-isn't beating.

29:56.440 --> 29:57.805
He's having a heart attack.

29:57.880 --> 30:00.406
I can restart it, or not. It's your choice.

30:00.480 --> 30:02.050
Skye.

30:03.080 --> 30:04.730
You think
I don't wanna watch him suffer?

30:04.800 --> 30:07.201
Not suffer, die.

30:07.280 --> 30:10.124
Garrett doesn't think
you're gonna let that happen.

30:12.720 --> 30:15.405
- He's a murderer.
-Yes, he is.

30:16.640 --> 30:17.766
Are you?

30:28.880 --> 30:30.405
- Okay. Stop.
-Where do you unlock the drive?

30:30.480 --> 30:31.606
- Bring him back!
-Where?

30:31.680 --> 30:34.809
35,000 feet. It's not based on longitude
or latitude, it's altitude.

30:34.880 --> 30:36.609
- You're lying.
-I'm not!

30:37.280 --> 30:39.442
I put the password in,
and I start the hack,

30:39.520 --> 30:41.363
and once we reach altitude, it unlocks.

30:41.440 --> 30:42.487
Now bring him back.

30:55.400 --> 30:58.768
Put the password in.
Start the hack. No tricks.

31:01.600 --> 31:03.204
You son of a bitch.

31:03.280 --> 31:04.645
Get the plane in the air.

31:04.720 --> 31:07.451
I can't. I can barely stand.

31:10.240 --> 31:11.446
That should help.

31:25.600 --> 31:27.762
Maria Hill to S.H.I.E.L.D. 616.

31:27.840 --> 31:31.128
You have 30 seconds to
stand down and surrender.

31:32.520 --> 31:35.330
I repeat, stand down and surrender.

31:37.160 --> 31:39.367
You gonna answer me, Ward,
or do I have to come over there?

31:39.840 --> 31:43.526
Maria Hill. I kind of hoped you
went down with the Triskelion.

31:43.600 --> 31:45.682
And I hoped you weren't
the duplicitous lowlife

31:45.760 --> 31:48.525
you turned out to be, but here we are.

31:48.680 --> 31:52.446
Gonna be honest with you, Hill,
I'm having a pretty bad day.

31:52.520 --> 31:54.648
So if I were you,
I would get the hell out of my way.

31:54.720 --> 31:56.131
Mmm, give up Skye,
and we'll talk about it.

31:56.360 --> 31:58.727
- Yeah, that's not happening.
-You know, I never liked you, Ward.

31:58.920 --> 32:00.684
Not since our first sit-down.

32:00.760 --> 32:03.889
But I never figured you
for John Garrett's lapdog.

32:03.960 --> 32:05.246
A lot of us lost respect for Fury

32:05.360 --> 32:06.691
when he picked you as his second.

32:07.600 --> 32:10.524
If he needed eye candy around,
he could've at least picked Romanoff.

32:11.000 --> 32:14.447
That's funny. I'll tell her you said that.

32:14.520 --> 32:17.205
Now hand Skye over,
or I'll have a squad of F-16s

32:17.280 --> 32:18.805
knock you on your ass.

32:18.880 --> 32:21.645
Even if you had that kind of pull
anymore, which you don't,

32:21.720 --> 32:23.245
Coulson would never let you do it.

32:24.240 --> 32:26.242
He would never sacrifice Skye like that.

32:26.320 --> 32:31.201
But you know Garrett would.
So don't try and follow us.

32:31.720 --> 32:33.245
This doesn't have to
go down like this, Ward.

32:33.320 --> 32:34.765
You don't owe Garrett anything.

32:35.400 --> 32:36.526
You're wrong.

32:47.560 --> 32:48.925
You want me to pursue?

32:49.000 --> 32:51.924
No. Their tracking systems
are up and running.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.048
I just hope we bought enough time.

33:33.280 --> 33:35.248
Are you okay? Did Ward hurt you?

33:35.320 --> 33:36.526
No, I'm okay.

33:36.600 --> 33:39.365
But, the encrypted hard drive,
I unlocked it for them.

33:39.440 --> 33:43.331
Forget that. We need to move.
We're gonna take the cockpit.

33:44.600 --> 33:47.410
- Wait. You came alone?
-it's okay. I can take Ward.

33:47.480 --> 33:50.131
I know, but how did you
get past Deathlok?

33:50.960 --> 33:53.611
- Deathlok's here on the plane?
-Yeah, you didn't take him out?

33:55.480 --> 33:57.369
- New plan. Run!
-Wait. What about you?

33:57.440 --> 33:58.851
Get to the cargo hold. Now!

33:59.320 --> 34:00.970
I can't let you leave, Agent Coulson.

34:01.040 --> 34:02.883
It's still my plane.

34:02.960 --> 34:04.405
--I don't need your permission.

34:13.199 --> 34:14.610
I've never used a parachute before!

34:15.120 --> 34:16.167
Forget that! Get in the car!

34:31.600 --> 34:33.489
Get down, get down!

34:37.040 --> 34:38.690
Buckle up!

34:50.159 --> 34:51.605
I told you to buckle up!

35:07.640 --> 35:09.449
Come on!
They must've hit the thrusters!

35:47.080 --> 35:48.411
That'll be 20 bucks.

35:53.440 --> 35:55.408
I'm putting the plane down.
We need to go after them.

35:55.480 --> 35:57.881
- No, we don't. We stay with the plan.
-I don't answer to you.

35:57.960 --> 35:59.200
Coulson and Skye
don't matter anymore.

35:59.280 --> 36:02.807
We have the data, and Garrett
wants us back. Right now.

36:02.880 --> 36:05.167
Listen, I'm not just gonna forget
what you did to me back there.

36:05.240 --> 36:08.801
You try anything like that again,
I will kill you.

36:08.880 --> 36:10.041
Wasn't personal.

36:12.040 --> 36:14.441
I was just following orders.

36:22.320 --> 36:24.766
Wow. I can't believe he shot Lola.

36:25.280 --> 36:26.645
I can't talk about it.

36:26.720 --> 36:28.370
Don't blame you for going after him.

36:28.440 --> 36:31.887
We'll need a base of operation,
weapons, tactical backup.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.126
Who do you have working for you?

36:33.200 --> 36:35.282
Okay, wait. Hold on, Coulson.

36:35.360 --> 36:38.364
There is no more backup.
No more hidden bunkers.

36:38.440 --> 36:40.124
Come on. I know Fury has others.

36:40.200 --> 36:41.850
There's no Fury.

36:41.920 --> 36:46.005
We're not bringing the band back
together again, Coulson. It's over.

36:47.080 --> 36:49.003
There is no S.H.I.E.L.D. anymore.

36:51.240 --> 36:52.287
Not officially.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.526
Look, I get it, okay?

36:55.600 --> 36:57.602
You have to take
Ward and Garrett down.

36:57.680 --> 37:00.650
But don't act like
it's some officially sanctioned mission.

37:00.720 --> 37:04.008
It's a personal vendetta.
And when it's done, you should walk.

37:04.080 --> 37:05.684
Let your people go their separate ways.

37:09.000 --> 37:10.206
And what,

37:11.480 --> 37:13.369
turn themselves in?

37:13.440 --> 37:15.363
Cut a deal? Work in the private sector?

37:16.040 --> 37:17.530
You know Stark would take you
in a heartbeat.

37:17.600 --> 37:19.011
It's not my style.

37:22.480 --> 37:25.563
I should go. You know where to find me.

37:25.680 --> 37:26.886
Say hello to Stark for...

37:27.760 --> 37:30.684
Oh, yeah. Never mind.
He thinks I'm dead.

37:37.000 --> 37:39.651
Must be some reason
why Ward did it.

37:40.520 --> 37:42.363
Maybe they brainwashed him.

37:43.160 --> 37:46.004
I don't know.
Some people are just evil.

37:46.960 --> 37:49.042
I'd rather not believe that.

37:49.160 --> 37:51.208
It's true.

37:51.280 --> 37:53.567
I just assumed we'd be
better at spotting it.

37:55.560 --> 37:57.801
Tell me that you're not HYDRA.

37:59.080 --> 38:00.206
What?

38:01.960 --> 38:05.169
I know that it's ridiculous,
but I just need to hear you say it.

38:10.000 --> 38:11.764
I'm not HYDRA.

38:12.440 --> 38:14.602
Yeah, good. 'Cause I'm not either.

38:14.680 --> 38:16.523
- Of course not.
-Yeah.

38:18.000 --> 38:19.604
- Because if you ever did...
-I wouldn't.

38:19.680 --> 38:22.251
...I don't know what I would do.

38:23.760 --> 38:26.047
You'll never have to find out.

38:40.400 --> 38:41.561
Thought you didn't eat junk food.

38:42.920 --> 38:43.967
I'm on vacation.

38:44.720 --> 38:45.801
Until...

38:47.760 --> 38:50.650
Till that man tells me it's time to work.

38:50.720 --> 38:53.371
Not tonight. Live a little.

38:54.760 --> 38:58.765
That case, I'm gonna go crazy.
Maybe have another bag.

39:03.040 --> 39:05.441
- Never been homeless before.

39:05.520 --> 39:08.649
It's not fun. At least we have a pool.

39:14.280 --> 39:15.964
What do you got
going on here?

39:16.080 --> 39:17.127
Chips?

39:22.600 --> 39:23.726
Wen get him.

39:24.640 --> 39:25.801
I know.

39:28.320 --> 39:30.971
I left them a little present
when I decrypted the drive.

39:31.040 --> 39:32.121
Should help.

39:41.080 --> 39:42.127
Thanks.

39:50.520 --> 39:52.966
Nice night.

40:15.160 --> 40:17.686
I was hoping you'd come back.

40:19.520 --> 40:20.885
- Ward is...
-I know.

40:23.200 --> 40:24.850
Hill told me.

40:28.720 --> 40:30.961
There's something you need to see.

40:36.360 --> 40:38.169
You wanted to know
who was behind T.A.H.I.T.I.?

40:39.640 --> 40:41.369
This is what I found out.

40:51.160 --> 40:53.162
Good morning, Director Fury.

40:54.040 --> 40:56.771
I regret to inform you that
I'm handing in my resignation.

40:57.720 --> 40:59.882
I know you brought me
on to Project T.A.H.I.T.I.

40:59.960 --> 41:02.247
because you trusted my judgment,

41:02.320 --> 41:05.005
and it's that judgment that's
telling me I can no longer,

41:05.080 --> 41:08.050
in good conscience,
let the testing continue.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.128
I understand you started the program

41:11.200 --> 41:14.761
to potentially save
a mortally-wounded Avenger.

41:14.840 --> 41:18.287
But the side effects are too extreme.

41:18.360 --> 41:20.681
We had initial success

41:20.760 --> 41:24.048
with the regenerative properties
of the Guest Host's tissue,

41:24.120 --> 41:26.441
but after the initial physical recovery,

41:26.520 --> 41:29.171
the subjects began
to deteriorate mentally,

41:29.240 --> 41:32.687
displaying hypergraphia,
aphasia, catatonia,

41:32.800 --> 41:35.963
or just complete psychosis.

41:36.040 --> 41:38.805
We don't know
if it was the biology at play,

41:38.880 --> 41:41.804
or simply the awareness
of what was done.

41:41.880 --> 41:44.121
But the only course of action

41:44.200 --> 41:47.170
that showed any promise of
stemming these side effects

41:47.240 --> 41:48.765
was memory replacement,

41:49.680 --> 41:52.763
erasing completely the awareness
of what they'd been through.

41:52.840 --> 41:56.447
And even those results
were very inconsistent.

41:57.560 --> 41:58.971
To be clear,

41:59.040 --> 42:02.601
I'm recommending the termination
of Project T.A.H.I.T.I.

42:02.680 --> 42:06.207
Under no circumstances should
these procedures or drugs

42:06.280 --> 42:08.567
be administered to anyone, ever.

42:09.760 --> 42:11.603
The cost is far too great.

42:13.480 --> 42:14.811
Thank you, sir.

42:20.120 --> 42:21.201
Huh.
