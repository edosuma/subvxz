00:55.010 --> 00:57.910
So why did you go up there that day?

00:58.000 --> 01:01.730
What on earth happened
between you and Hyun-jo?

01:01.990 --> 01:05.180
[We only tried to protect the mountain.]

01:05.260 --> 01:06.690
Because that was our job.

01:06.820 --> 01:09.710
I heard you're a legend.

01:09.920 --> 01:11.690
Is there anything I can do to help?

01:11.770 --> 01:13.370

01:28.150 --> 01:29.660
I came to ask you something.

01:29.750 --> 01:32.600
Do you know anything about this case?

01:32.770 --> 01:35.670
Isn't this that Yang Geun-tak guy
who was found recently?

01:35.750 --> 01:36.850
What about the yellow ribbon?

01:36.930 --> 01:39.530
Why are you asking
about yellow the ribbon?

01:39.830 --> 01:43.190
I found a spot for you
at the headquarters in Wonju.

01:43.560 --> 01:44.570

01:44.660 --> 01:45.870

01:45.960 --> 01:48.690

06:32.980 --> 06:35.670
No, you did a great job.

Was there anything else

and come down.

11:16.430 --> 11:18.320
I'm sorry.

11:20.000 --> 11:23.030
Don't confuse Jirisan to be for beginners

11:23.110 --> 11:26.850

go to a church or a temple.

How can you not know?
This is very important.

14:40.800 --> 14:42.480
You must call out

"King's orders" before doing it.

Otherwise, you'll be unlucky

to those who didn't say it?

had their leg broken,

You should do your homework
instead of coming here.

16:28.440 --> 16:30.040
All right?

16:31.970 --> 16:33.320
Don't fall! You'll break your skull.

if you don't pay it right away.

17:05.660 --> 17:08.050
There's a late charge.
You'd better pay it in time.

I've never seen this kind of
talisman before.

18:02.650 --> 18:04.450
I should take it and do some research.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.860
People like these must come here often.

18:07.940 --> 18:10.920
You know the expression in Korean,
"go to a valley,"

18:11.010 --> 18:12.520
which means "to die?"

18:12.730 --> 18:14.660
"Gone to a valley."

18:14.740 --> 18:18.990
It originated from here, since no one
walks out of Baektogol Valley alive.

[This place has
especially strong yin energy,]

18:22.050 --> 18:23.270

18:27.550 --> 18:29.990
Many people died here
for a period of time.

18:31.630 --> 18:33.770
Human bones are still being
dug up to this day.

18:36.880 --> 18:40.990

with a cross or stone pagoda.

[They're for those who died
without a grave.]

18:45.660 --> 18:49.390
If ghosts exist,
this is the place for them.

18:51.540 --> 18:54.220
That's why these shamans
come here to get energy.

18:57.330 --> 18:59.140
[This place had such a history.]

19:00.940 --> 19:02.370

-Take care.
-See you.

Where to?

19:36.470 --> 19:38.150
Gamnamu Restaurant would be ideal.

19:38.240 --> 19:39.920
No. If Grandma gets in,
it'll be all night.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.220

19:41.300 --> 19:42.650
Sure. Let's go.

19:44.410 --> 19:45.500
What do you think?

19:45.590 --> 19:47.810
We have to drink to chase the ghosts away.

19:47.900 --> 19:51.050
I see. What about Sol then?

19:51.640 --> 19:54.450
That's exactly why he's not drinking.

19:55.880 --> 19:56.720
What?

19:57.350 --> 19:59.320
You mean he was the top in his year?

19:59.450 --> 20:00.500
That's right.

20:00.580 --> 20:03.310
Mount Jirisan is so wide and rough,
so everyone avoids coming here.

20:03.400 --> 20:05.500
But they were shocked that
the top volunteered to come.

20:05.580 --> 20:07.720
Wow. He's the opposite of Yi-gang.

20:07.810 --> 20:10.030
She was the lowest.

20:12.260 --> 20:15.070
Hey! I didn't care about the test.

20:15.160 --> 20:16.710
Whatever.

20:17.300 --> 20:18.640
Actually, that's true.

20:19.270 --> 20:23.140
She hated mountains,
but her granny dragged her here.

20:23.220 --> 20:24.520
What about the promotion test then?

20:24.610 --> 20:26.750
You got a nosebleed studying,

20:26.830 --> 20:30.190
yet you got the lowest score
in the history of national park rangers.

20:30.280 --> 20:31.750
She's always the lowest.

20:31.960 --> 20:34.940
Look at you. Hey! You failed the test too.

20:35.020 --> 20:36.320
Settle down.

20:36.700 --> 20:39.680
I'm embarrassed to be
the only promoted one here.

20:40.150 --> 20:41.490
Seriously.

20:42.080 --> 20:43.380
I'm so embarrassed.

[Sweet potato Makgeolli]

20:58.000 --> 20:59.800
She drank sweet potato makgeolli.

21:09.840 --> 21:11.900
Thanks for the drinks. See you all.

21:11.980 --> 21:13.280
Hey, you drank...

21:19.830 --> 21:21.090
I'll walk her home.

21:21.390 --> 21:22.770
You know she drank sweet potato...

21:28.910 --> 21:30.210
Will he be okay?

21:30.500 --> 21:32.350
He should go through it too.

You want to get some fresh air?

22:13.170 --> 22:14.100
Yi-gang.

22:14.850 --> 22:16.030
By the way,

22:16.200 --> 22:19.810
how did you become a ranger
if you hated mountains so much?

22:47.070 --> 22:48.160
I'll...

22:48.920 --> 22:50.430
I'll tell you

22:51.060 --> 22:54.580
how I became a ranger.

22:55.420 --> 22:56.770
Listen carefully.

23:01.090 --> 23:03.700
I was six

23:04.370 --> 23:07.180
when I first climbed this mountain.

23:08.230 --> 23:09.370
Yi-gang?

23:13.150 --> 23:16.000
My parents lived near Mount Jirisan.

23:16.970 --> 23:20.160
I reached Cheonwangbong Peak
for the first time at seven.

23:22.720 --> 23:24.450
When I was eight,

23:24.740 --> 23:28.350
I brought a Coke and drank it there.

23:30.410 --> 23:31.800
That's when I

23:32.340 --> 23:35.070
started climbing the mountain.

23:40.870 --> 23:45.190
When I was nine,
I started to walk along the ridges.

23:53.890 --> 23:55.060
Yi-gang?

23:55.530 --> 23:56.620
It's okay.

23:59.140 --> 24:00.310
I'm fine.

Are you listening?

24:03.760 --> 24:04.640
Yes.

24:07.240 --> 24:08.970
That's when I started

24:09.850 --> 24:13.330
flying around the mountains.

24:13.420 --> 24:14.260
You know?

24:14.340 --> 24:16.230
Instead of walking.

24:17.910 --> 24:21.690

-First love?
-Yes.

What is it?

27:34.300 --> 27:36.780
Granny Geum-rye
is up on the mountain again.

27:36.860 --> 27:38.960
And she's not back yet.
She's not picking up her phone, either.

27:40.680 --> 27:42.360
Are they sure she went up the mountain?

27:42.450 --> 27:44.170
Her rucksack and equipment are gone too.

But she never gets lost in the mountain.

Who is this Granny Geum-rye?

28:03.740 --> 28:06.720
She lost her mother in Baektogol
when she was young.

28:06.810 --> 28:10.210
So she goes up several times a year
to commemorate her mother.

28:10.290 --> 28:12.600

An old lady went missing.

When I fell behind earlier...

35:07.640 --> 35:09.950
Oh, this is Private Ahn.

35:10.330 --> 35:13.640
He lost his water bottle
at Baektogol ridge three hours ago,

35:13.730 --> 35:17.130
and he went AWOL and fell behind.

35:18.220 --> 35:19.060
So?

35:20.110 --> 35:21.830
What happened then?

35:40.270 --> 35:41.740
You saw a civilian?

35:42.290 --> 35:45.100
Yes, sir. He said he came for hiking.

35:45.650 --> 35:46.950
He was looking at a rucksack,

35:47.030 --> 35:49.300
and he said he was wondering whose it was.

35:49.510 --> 35:51.360
What color was the rucksack?

35:51.780 --> 35:53.120
It was pink.

35:54.840 --> 35:56.520
Was this it?

35:57.660 --> 35:59.170
Yes. That's the one.

36:01.060 --> 36:02.320

36:05.970 --> 36:09.540
It was the 50-minute point from Baeksil.

stomachache, and hallucinations.

I've had to let a sergeant die before.

45:35.480 --> 45:38.000
I valued him more than anyone else.

45:41.320 --> 45:43.000
But he died alone and lonely

45:44.430 --> 45:46.230
on the mountain because of me.

45:50.390 --> 45:53.370
If we keep this pace,
we'll set a new record.

46:07.610 --> 46:08.910
Yes, sir!

46:10.010 --> 46:11.390
This is your hometown, right?

46:11.520 --> 46:12.740
That's right, sir!

46:13.280 --> 46:14.500
Must be nice.

46:14.580 --> 46:17.150
I hope your hometown energizes you.

46:18.240 --> 46:19.410
Thank you, sir!

46:19.750 --> 46:20.970
Let's go!

46:29.790 --> 46:31.380
What do you mean?

46:31.510 --> 46:32.690
Sergeant Kim is missing?

46:32.770 --> 46:34.280
He disappeared while I wasn't looking.

46:34.370 --> 46:35.630
How long has it been?

46:35.710 --> 46:37.140
About thirty minutes.

46:38.440 --> 46:39.450
[Sergeant Kim!]

46:42.770 --> 46:43.770

46:43.980 --> 46:46.670
-Sergeant Kim.
-Sergeant Kim.

47:15.860 --> 47:16.870
Hyeon-su!

47:32.110 --> 47:33.210
Hyeon-su...

47:40.850 --> 47:42.030
Hyeon-su...

47:48.330 --> 47:50.050
[And that's when I started]

47:51.180 --> 47:53.700
to see people dying on this mountain.

47:56.640 --> 48:00.000
[At first, I thought
I was imagining things.]

48:02.350 --> 48:07.810
[Last night, a 70-year-old woman fell off
from a cliff on Mount Jirisan and died.]

48:07.900 --> 48:12.270
[Allegedly, the accident happened
as a rotten rope on a cliff broke.]

48:12.350 --> 48:15.710
[National Park Service has been
accused for the accident.]

48:16.000 --> 48:17.940
[But they were always followed]

48:18.730 --> 48:24.320
[by the news that something bad
happened on Mount Jirisan.]

48:32.380 --> 48:34.570
I was afraid of coming back here.

48:36.250 --> 48:39.060
But I thought it was
the right thing to do.

48:41.920 --> 48:43.510
Sol told me

48:45.950 --> 48:48.340
that there's something
about this Baektogol.

48:49.690 --> 48:52.460
I'm not sure if it's
a ghost or a guardian spirit.

48:53.090 --> 48:54.770
But I think it gave me a gift.

48:57.370 --> 48:59.220
To save people.

49:04.260 --> 49:05.480
I believed in them.

when I was little.

[Lieutenant Choi]

49:24.760 --> 49:25.720
What's going on?

49:25.810 --> 49:27.490
[Captain Kang, please help.]

49:27.570 --> 49:30.130
[Private Ahn is missing.]

49:30.470 --> 49:31.810
What do you mean?

49:48.650 --> 49:49.700
What is it?

49:54.620 --> 49:55.790
Captain Kang!

50:00.540 --> 50:01.630
What happened?

50:02.050 --> 50:03.100
Tell him.

50:03.190 --> 50:06.880
Private Ahn was on night watch,
but he wasn't feeling well.

50:06.970 --> 50:09.280
He said he'd go throw up,

50:09.570 --> 50:12.430
so I thought he'd be
back and asleep, but...

50:12.510 --> 50:14.190
-Did you report this?
-No.

50:14.270 --> 50:16.790
Even if I did, it would
take them hours to get here.

50:16.880 --> 50:17.840
Hang on.

50:17.930 --> 50:19.060
He threw up?

50:19.150 --> 50:20.150
Go away.

50:33.890 --> 50:36.830
We found traces of vomit
at the entrance to the forest there.

50:38.300 --> 50:40.480
Assuming he went that way,

50:40.560 --> 50:42.200
we went in to search.

50:42.500 --> 50:44.010
But we almost got lost too,

50:44.090 --> 50:45.770
so we had to retreat.

50:46.700 --> 50:48.710
Dalgwi Forest is a climax forest.

50:48.920 --> 50:51.060
It's filled with trees that look the same.

50:52.160 --> 50:55.600
[People get direction illusion in there
even during daytime.]

50:55.680 --> 50:58.790
[Our missing man probably did too.]

50:59.170 --> 51:01.400
[Keep checking your GPS device
during the search.]

51:01.520 --> 51:04.880
[If you're circling in one direction,
direction illusion has begun.]

51:20.880 --> 51:22.520
Do you think we can find him?

51:23.660 --> 51:25.250
You're different from me.

51:25.840 --> 51:27.480
We'll go back together with him.

51:27.650 --> 51:29.070
Let's make that happen.

51:39.950 --> 51:41.130
Private Ahn!

51:41.720 --> 51:42.680

53:23.730 --> 53:24.870
How's his state?

53:24.950 --> 53:26.920
Not good.

53:27.010 --> 53:28.480
Private Ahn!

53:30.870 --> 53:32.680
Call a helicopter! He's in a bad state.

53:32.760 --> 53:34.740

54:06.820 --> 54:08.540
How can you leave me like this?

54:18.710 --> 54:20.980

54:21.310 --> 54:23.330
Oh, my goodness.

54:57.940 --> 54:59.070
Are you all right?

55:05.030 --> 55:06.250
We're going home.

55:07.340 --> 55:08.980
Take good care of her.

55:31.370 --> 55:32.420
Everything will be fine.

55:35.230 --> 55:37.040
You tried your best.

55:37.290 --> 55:38.510
Granny Geum-rye

55:38.720 --> 55:44.970
has confused the edible mushrooms
with poisonous ones before.

55:45.900 --> 55:47.700
They look similar.

55:50.770 --> 55:51.990
By the way...

55:52.910 --> 55:54.510
Was Yi-gang okay?

55:56.940 --> 56:00.930
When her parents died
in the Dowon Valley flood,

56:02.110 --> 56:03.620
Yi-gang found their bodies

56:04.550 --> 56:07.320
with her own hands on the mountain.

56:08.700 --> 56:09.840
How?

56:10.010 --> 56:13.110
Things were slow
because they were short of staff.

56:13.200 --> 56:15.930
She got frustrated and went up herself.

56:18.200 --> 56:19.620
Maybe she thought

56:20.460 --> 56:22.940
they'd be alive at the time.

56:24.540 --> 56:27.390
In any case, she fainted at the sight

56:28.530 --> 56:30.210
and had to be carried down.

56:36.050 --> 56:38.270
Those memories don't easily fade.

56:39.200 --> 56:41.420
So it's still hard for her
to look at a corpse.

56:42.260 --> 56:43.940
If it's that hard,

56:44.450 --> 56:46.380
why does she keep doing this?

56:48.480 --> 56:50.960
You'll see when you get to
her twenty-four.

But I'm your colleague.

57:14.600 --> 57:15.860
Doesn't matter.

Wow, this is so good!

57:22.160 --> 57:24.390
This will be the last time I'm doing this.

57:26.650 --> 57:28.080
You should drink if you want.

57:29.010 --> 57:30.100
It's not sweet potato flavor.

We don't carry those here.

Now tell me.

You must have come for a reason.

57:41.650 --> 57:43.330
I went to see Private Ahn.

57:45.300 --> 57:46.810
He's gotten a lot better.

57:54.880 --> 57:56.100
Thank you, sir.

58:07.810 --> 58:09.410
It was food poisoning?

58:11.850 --> 58:14.950
Yes. I ate something bad.

58:16.630 --> 58:18.150
I heard from Lieutenant Choi

58:19.150 --> 58:20.830
that you drank water from the valley.

58:21.510 --> 58:25.500
Yes. I found my water bottle,
and it was empty.

58:26.380 --> 58:27.890
The spring water looked cold.

58:46.790 --> 58:48.340
Who gave you the yogurt drink?

58:49.770 --> 58:53.720
You were fine when we first met.

58:59.220 --> 59:02.410
You would've felt sick right away
if you drank bad water.

59:05.900 --> 59:09.970
Tell me the truth, and I won't tell
Lieutenant Choi.

59:13.710 --> 59:14.890
Yogurt drink?

59:14.970 --> 59:16.020
When he fell behind,

59:16.100 --> 59:20.470
the hiker looking at the pink rucksack
handed him a yogurt.

59:20.980 --> 59:24.170
He took it and drank
before he went to sleep.

59:25.600 --> 59:27.280
Since then, he felt dizzy and nauseous

59:27.610 --> 59:29.460
and was even hallucinated.

59:30.890 --> 59:32.740
What do you mean?

59:33.160 --> 59:35.930
You can't get poisoning
from drinking yogurt.

59:41.510 --> 59:45.340
Someone was being chased
at the stone pagoda ground.

59:47.230 --> 59:50.210
The person fainted and fell.

59:51.640 --> 59:54.660
There was also
an empty yogurt bottle next to him.

But that person

59:58.520 --> 59:59.990
wasn't Private Ahn.

1:00:00.960 --> 1:00:03.400
Because he was found in Dalgwi Forest.

1:00:08.230 --> 1:00:12.090
Someone else must have
drunk it and passed out.

[Someone else was on that mountain.]

1:04:11.860 --> 1:04:14.170
