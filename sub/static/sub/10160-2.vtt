00:01.084 --> 00:02.503
Previously on
When Calls the Heart...

00:02.503 --> 00:05.046
It's over with Charles,
once and for all.

00:05.046 --> 00:06.047
[Rosemary]
They're sending a reporter

00:06.047 --> 00:07.883
to do a story
on New Year's Eve--

00:07.883 --> 00:08.884
Featuring... you.

00:08.884 --> 00:09.969
If you were hungry,

00:09.969 --> 00:10.970
you should have
just asked.

00:10.970 --> 00:12.596
-What's your name?
-Cody.

00:12.596 --> 00:14.139
-Looking for a friend of mine.
-I don't want any trouble.

00:14.139 --> 00:15.850
I think I'll be sticking around
for a while.

00:25.108 --> 00:27.194
I don't always agree
with your methods...

00:27.194 --> 00:28.696
[rattles lock]

00:28.696 --> 00:31.072
but you somehow manage
to get the job done.

00:31.072 --> 00:33.701
Well, that's supposed to be
what counts, right?

00:33.701 --> 00:34.660
[chuckles]

00:34.660 --> 00:36.203
There's still
a little paperwork to do,

00:36.203 --> 00:37.454
but I'm pleased to inform you

00:37.454 --> 00:40.040
that you've been
officially reinstated.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.542
Effective immediately.

00:41.542 --> 00:43.084
I appreciate that, Sam.

00:43.084 --> 00:45.796
I'm going to take
a leave of absence as of now.

00:45.796 --> 00:47.339
Well, don't let it
take you too long.

00:47.339 --> 00:51.092
We need men like you
on our side.

00:51.092 --> 00:52.553
Good work.

01:01.102 --> 01:02.688
Bill.

01:02.688 --> 01:05.440
I think you and I
need to have a talk.

01:07.108 --> 01:09.444
Not now, Jack.

01:14.115 --> 01:15.951
Lee!

01:15.951 --> 01:17.494
Hey!

01:17.494 --> 01:19.120
You are looking busy,
my friend.

01:19.120 --> 01:20.121
You have no idea.

01:20.121 --> 01:21.498
Wouldn't have
anything to do

01:21.498 --> 01:24.125
with Rosemary and the New Year's
Eve celebration, would it?

01:24.125 --> 01:25.335
My resolution this year

01:25.335 --> 01:27.086
is to learn how to say "no"
to that woman.

01:27.086 --> 01:29.048
[laughs]
Good luck with that.

01:29.048 --> 01:30.131
Thank you. See you later.

01:30.131 --> 01:31.132
See you.

01:31.132 --> 01:33.134
[Elizabeth] Rip!

01:33.134 --> 01:34.135
Please?

01:34.135 --> 01:36.095
[Rip howls a protest]

01:39.683 --> 01:40.976
Rip!

01:40.976 --> 01:43.311
Please?

01:43.311 --> 01:45.439
Should I even ask?

01:45.439 --> 01:47.649
I took him
for his walk.

01:47.649 --> 01:48.483
And?

01:48.483 --> 01:49.818
And he chased a rabbit

01:49.818 --> 01:51.278
through the mud
by the pond,

01:51.278 --> 01:53.154
and wouldn't come back,

01:53.154 --> 01:54.531
and then
I slipped and fell.

01:54.531 --> 01:57.242
Well...
dirt becomes you.

01:57.242 --> 02:00.161
This used to be
my favorite skirt.

02:00.161 --> 02:02.163
I think he's worn out
his welcome.

02:02.163 --> 02:03.248
No, no, no, no, no. No.

02:03.248 --> 02:05.459
Giving up now would be
a sign of weakness.

02:05.459 --> 02:07.836
And he's only just
started to respect me,

02:07.836 --> 02:09.713
right?

02:10.631 --> 02:12.841
Rome wasn't
built in a day.

02:13.926 --> 02:14.969
Come on, boy!

02:17.178 --> 02:18.680
Go.

02:26.187 --> 02:27.439
Come on!

02:31.192 --> 02:35.948
[♪♪♪]

02:52.213 --> 02:55.300
I thought we'd be doing
the interview in your home.

02:55.300 --> 02:56.343
It's being repaired.

02:56.343 --> 02:58.012
Yes, lots of
repairs to do.

02:58.012 --> 02:59.387
Really? What happened?

02:59.387 --> 03:01.556
-Flood.
-Fire.

03:01.556 --> 03:02.766
First,
there was a flood--

03:02.766 --> 03:04.225
-Yeah.
-And then there was a fire.

03:04.225 --> 03:06.020
It's unfortunate it wasn't
the other way around,

03:06.020 --> 03:07.771
then the flood could've
put out the fire.

03:07.771 --> 03:10.357
Yeah, It's been
a very... difficult year.

03:10.357 --> 03:14.153
But that's just
life on the frontier.

03:14.153 --> 03:15.821
Yes, it is.

03:15.821 --> 03:17.156
And how long

03:17.156 --> 03:20.117
have the two of you
been united in holy matrimony?

03:20.117 --> 03:21.242
-Oh--
-Uh...

03:21.242 --> 03:23.244
-Well, it's been a while--
-Yeah...

03:23.244 --> 03:24.621
Quite a while.
Four years--

03:24.621 --> 03:26.165
-Yeah!
-...Ish. Yeah.

03:26.165 --> 03:27.582
[Lee] I mean, it's gone by
so quickly, though,

03:27.582 --> 03:29.292
it's hard to keep track.

03:29.292 --> 03:30.669
[chuckling]

03:30.669 --> 03:33.630
I see you don't wear
a wedding ring, Mrs. LeVeaux?

03:33.630 --> 03:35.256
-It's lost.
-It's being repair--

03:35.256 --> 03:38.259
What I was gonna
say is that, uh,

03:38.259 --> 03:41.304
I lost...
so much weight,

03:41.304 --> 03:42.931
that it has
to be repaired

03:42.931 --> 03:44.474
so that it fits.

03:44.474 --> 03:45.934
She has
very bony fingers.

03:45.934 --> 03:48.729
Not bony, Honeybug.
Just... slender.

03:48.729 --> 03:51.606
Yes, that's what
I meant-- slender. Right.

03:52.649 --> 03:55.276
You don't wear a wedding ring
either, Mr. LeVeaux?

03:55.276 --> 03:57.487
Um... N-No. No.

03:57.487 --> 04:00.199
No, I'm-- I'm, uh...
allergic to gold.

04:00.199 --> 04:01.575
Gives him a rash.

04:01.575 --> 04:02.951
A bit personal,

04:02.951 --> 04:04.494
don't you think,
Love-Button?

04:04.494 --> 04:05.746
Tsk. Well...

04:05.746 --> 04:06.997
Well, I love personal stories.

04:06.997 --> 04:08.999
In fact,
the more, the better.

04:08.999 --> 04:11.126
Oh! We have
so many to share,

04:11.126 --> 04:11.960
but the time!

04:11.960 --> 04:13.670
You... need to
get back to work--

04:13.670 --> 04:15.214
-Right.
-...Dear.

04:15.214 --> 04:16.506
And, uh,
we should fly,

04:16.506 --> 04:19.009
if we're gonna catch
pictures of that sunset.

04:19.009 --> 04:21.762
It's only 4:00
in the afternoon.

04:21.762 --> 04:23.638
You know what they say
about the early bird.

04:23.638 --> 04:25.933
Likes to catch
the sunset.

04:25.933 --> 04:27.601
Huh?

04:28.476 --> 04:29.937
-Shall we?
-Yes.

04:32.439 --> 04:34.315
Laura?

04:34.315 --> 04:36.317
Miss Thatcher!
What are you doing here?

04:36.317 --> 04:37.903
I brought you a book.

04:37.903 --> 04:40.197
I thought we might
look at it together.

04:40.197 --> 04:42.282
What kind of book?

04:42.282 --> 04:44.243
Well, it's full
of paintings

04:44.243 --> 04:45.493
by famous artists,

04:45.493 --> 04:46.870
like Harvey Dunn.

04:46.870 --> 04:49.206
He grew up on the frontier,
just like you,

04:49.206 --> 04:50.082
and a lot
of his paintings

04:50.082 --> 04:52.333
are about people
who work very hard,

04:52.333 --> 04:54.836
just like you
and your dad.

04:54.836 --> 04:57.297
This lady
looks like my mom.

05:00.383 --> 05:02.803
Did your mom
have red hair?

05:04.345 --> 05:06.932
She said I was
good at drawing.

05:08.349 --> 05:09.601
I'm sure she wouldn't

05:09.601 --> 05:12.104
want you to be sad
all the time, Laura.

05:12.104 --> 05:15.149
She wouldn't want
your dad to be sad, either.

05:16.275 --> 05:18.318
Can I keep this?

05:18.318 --> 05:20.487
I was hoping
you'd want to.

05:20.487 --> 05:22.030
[chuckles]

05:22.030 --> 05:24.324
Here. Let me
show you another.

05:26.367 --> 05:29.329
That one's nice.

05:36.128 --> 05:36.920
How's Becky?

05:36.920 --> 05:38.172
Another day
of bed rest,

05:38.172 --> 05:40.381
and she should be
back on her feet for New Year's.

05:40.381 --> 05:41.382
[relieved sigh]

05:41.382 --> 05:42.509
That's good news.

05:42.509 --> 05:43.927
Have you thought about
what you're going to do?

05:43.927 --> 05:45.679
Going to do
about what?

05:45.679 --> 05:47.681
[Doctor] Well, when
the little girl recovers,

05:47.681 --> 05:49.599
there's no reason
to keep the two of them here.

05:49.599 --> 05:52.393
They are runaways,
I'm assuming?

05:52.393 --> 05:53.603
Yes, but...

05:53.603 --> 05:55.438
Then they'll need
to be placed in a home.

05:55.438 --> 05:58.150
[Abigail] I don't think they
should go anywhere right now.

05:58.150 --> 06:00.359
No. Not right now.

06:01.402 --> 06:04.363
But you'll need to
do it eventually.

06:15.583 --> 06:18.337
[♪♪♪]

06:18.337 --> 06:20.379
Oh. Yoo-hoo!

06:20.379 --> 06:22.423
You must be
the reporter

06:22.423 --> 06:24.425
from the San
Francisco Herald.

06:24.425 --> 06:26.427
Oh, indeed! Mike Ward.

06:26.427 --> 06:27.679
And who might you be?

06:27.679 --> 06:29.597
Florence Blakeley.

06:29.597 --> 06:31.432
I'm on
the New Year's Committee,

06:31.432 --> 06:33.227
and may I say

06:33.227 --> 06:36.688
we are thrilled to have you
here in Hope Valley!

06:36.688 --> 06:38.940
Well, Mr. Ward,
there you are!

06:39.774 --> 06:41.484
It's a shame Mrs. Blakeley

06:41.484 --> 06:43.444
isn't able to stay
and chat with us.

06:43.444 --> 06:45.446
[realizing]
Mrs. Blakeley!

06:45.446 --> 06:46.447
In your essay, you wrote,

06:46.447 --> 06:48.075
Mrs. Blakeley is the one

06:48.075 --> 06:50.911
"who always finds a cloud
to every silver lining."

06:50.911 --> 06:52.996
Would you care to comment?

06:52.996 --> 06:54.122
Excuse me?

06:54.122 --> 06:57.042
W-What I meant
by that was...

06:58.168 --> 06:59.460
Florence, here,

06:59.460 --> 07:01.963
is the one...

07:01.963 --> 07:02.797
that...

07:02.797 --> 07:05.675
keeps us all on track.

07:05.675 --> 07:07.719
We'd be absolutely
lost without her.

07:07.719 --> 07:10.347
That's very sweet
of you to say...

07:10.347 --> 07:11.890
I think.

07:11.890 --> 07:13.641
Now, I know you have
work to do, dear,

07:13.641 --> 07:16.270
so please, don't
let us keep you.

07:17.437 --> 07:18.813
And you...

07:18.813 --> 07:21.066
I have a very busy day
planned for the two of us,

07:21.066 --> 07:23.360
so we really have no free time.

07:23.360 --> 07:24.527
At all.

07:24.527 --> 07:26.487
And I assume Mr. LeVeaux
will be joining us?

07:26.487 --> 07:27.906
"Mr. LeVeaux"?

07:27.906 --> 07:30.491
...Is very busy,
and, unfortunately,

07:30.491 --> 07:31.952
he has
a full schedule!

07:31.952 --> 07:34.454
Have you seen
our water tower?

07:34.454 --> 07:36.915
[Mike] Why would I want
to see your water tower?

07:36.915 --> 07:38.499
[Rosemary]
It's very impressive.

07:38.499 --> 07:40.710
All that water.

07:40.710 --> 07:42.796
In a tower.

07:42.796 --> 07:45.465
[♪♪♪]

07:47.842 --> 07:49.552
Have you seen
Becky or Cody?

07:49.552 --> 07:50.720
No.

07:50.720 --> 07:52.639
Becky isn't supposed to
be out of bed.

07:52.639 --> 07:54.515
Well, she's not upstairs
and neither is Cody.

07:54.515 --> 07:57.602
[♪♪♪]

07:57.602 --> 08:00.355
-Becky?
-Cody!

08:02.523 --> 08:04.943
Jack! Jack.

08:04.943 --> 08:06.694
It's Becky and Cody--
I think they may have run away.

08:06.694 --> 08:07.821
How long
have they been missing?

08:07.821 --> 08:09.823
I don't know.
They could've left hours ago.

08:09.823 --> 08:10.865
Well, if they're on foot,

08:10.865 --> 08:12.075
I'm sure they haven't
gotten very far.

08:12.075 --> 08:13.910
Becky isn't supposed to
be out at all.

08:13.910 --> 08:15.787
I'm gonna search north,
towards the river,

08:15.787 --> 08:17.038
back the way they came.

08:17.038 --> 08:18.206
What if
they didn't go that way?

08:18.206 --> 08:20.000
See if Lee can
spare a couple men.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.543
Tell them to head south
towards Buxton. Go.

08:22.543 --> 08:24.087
All right.

08:24.087 --> 08:25.546
Bill!

08:25.546 --> 08:26.547
I need your help.

08:26.547 --> 08:27.590
With what?

08:27.590 --> 08:29.134
I'll explain on the way.

08:33.430 --> 08:34.514
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

08:34.514 --> 08:35.723
Let me help you
with that.

08:35.723 --> 08:37.392
Oh. Thanks.

08:39.144 --> 08:41.771
Say, do you think the old man
who runs this place

08:41.771 --> 08:44.065
could use
an extra set of hands?

08:44.065 --> 08:45.692
Are you looking for a job?

08:45.692 --> 08:46.776
Well, I could be.

08:46.776 --> 08:48.987
If the right opportunity
came along.

08:50.238 --> 08:52.657
I heard that Mr. Yost
needs a driver.

08:52.657 --> 08:54.201
Probably
doesn't pay much,

08:54.201 --> 08:55.743
but he's inside,
if you want to talk to him.

08:55.743 --> 08:58.038
Thanks so much, Miss...

08:58.038 --> 08:59.580
Stanton.

08:59.580 --> 09:01.166
Don't you have a first name?

09:01.166 --> 09:03.251
It's Clara.

09:03.251 --> 09:05.420
That's a pretty name
for a pretty girl.

09:13.387 --> 09:15.680
[Jack] How long is this
leave of absence going to last?

09:15.680 --> 09:18.266
I haven't decided.
Whoa...

09:18.266 --> 09:20.894
If I know you,
it won't be long.

09:20.894 --> 09:22.270
[Bill] Looks deserted.

09:22.270 --> 09:23.230
[Jack] Cody?

09:23.230 --> 09:24.105
Becky?

09:24.105 --> 09:25.857
For kids
traveling on foot,

09:25.857 --> 09:27.150
they're moving
pretty fast.

09:27.150 --> 09:28.609
Any ideas?

09:28.609 --> 09:30.111
Keep heading north.

09:30.111 --> 09:32.280
Hyah!

09:32.280 --> 09:33.656
[Becky coughing]

09:33.656 --> 09:34.949
I don't think
I can make it.

09:34.949 --> 09:35.992
Sure you can!

09:35.992 --> 09:37.577
If we get to the mine,

09:37.577 --> 09:38.619
we can hide
till morning.

09:38.619 --> 09:40.621
Come on.

09:40.621 --> 09:43.583
[♪♪♪]

09:45.168 --> 09:47.212
Cody! Becky!

09:48.296 --> 09:49.256
Whoa, whoa.

09:50.840 --> 09:52.884
They must've taken shelter.

09:52.884 --> 09:55.136
The mine shaft.

09:57.889 --> 10:00.559
[♪♪♪]

10:04.896 --> 10:06.647
It's getting late.

10:06.647 --> 10:08.816
Don't worry.

10:08.816 --> 10:10.985
Jack and Bill
will find them.

10:10.985 --> 10:13.154
They were safe here.

10:13.154 --> 10:15.323
Why did
they run away?

10:17.909 --> 10:20.120
I don't know.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.956
But they've been out
on their own before

10:22.956 --> 10:24.832
and nothing's going
to happen to them.

10:24.832 --> 10:26.042
Becky is so sick.

10:26.042 --> 10:27.668
She shouldn't be
out in the cold.

10:27.668 --> 10:29.670
Abigail...

10:29.670 --> 10:31.631
they'll be okay.

10:32.882 --> 10:35.469
From your lips
to God's ears.

10:37.678 --> 10:40.390
[exhales deeply]

10:40.390 --> 10:42.476
[Becky coughing]

10:45.604 --> 10:46.687
Come on, Becky!

10:46.687 --> 10:47.772
Go on without me.

10:47.772 --> 10:49.065
You can't quit now.

10:49.065 --> 10:51.234
Daddy always said,
"Winners never quit."

10:51.234 --> 10:53.612
Then you be the winner
for both of us, okay?

10:53.612 --> 10:54.695
[Jack] Cody! Becky!

10:54.695 --> 10:56.531
Come on!

10:56.531 --> 10:58.366
Go right now, or I'll never
speak to you again!

10:58.366 --> 10:59.700
I'm not leaving
without you!

10:59.700 --> 11:01.536
Go!

11:05.081 --> 11:07.917
[calling out]
Over here!

11:09.877 --> 11:12.506
[♪♪♪]

11:18.386 --> 11:19.678
Whoa...

11:24.725 --> 11:26.727
Becky's asleep.

11:26.727 --> 11:27.770
I'm going to see

11:27.770 --> 11:29.397
if Dr. Burns can
come by again later.

11:29.397 --> 11:30.731
Aren't you supposed to
see Jack tonight?

11:30.731 --> 11:31.816
He'll understand.

11:31.816 --> 11:33.234
I'll see him tomorrow.

11:35.820 --> 11:38.198
Am I in trouble?

11:39.740 --> 11:41.493
No, sweetheart,
you're not in trouble,

11:41.493 --> 11:43.786
but I'd still like to know
why you ran away.

11:43.786 --> 11:45.413
I heard you and the doctor.

11:45.413 --> 11:47.457
You were
going to send us back.

11:49.708 --> 11:53.046
I know that this is hard
for you to understand, Cody...

11:54.297 --> 11:56.550
But you have to have faith.

11:56.550 --> 11:59.760
You have to know in your heart
that God is watching over you,

11:59.760 --> 12:02.305
and no matter what happens,
He has a plan for you,

12:02.305 --> 12:05.016
even if you don't know
what that plan is.

12:05.016 --> 12:06.851
Does He have a plan
for you, too?

12:06.851 --> 12:08.395
[chuckles] Yes.

12:08.395 --> 12:10.063
But you want to know a secret?

12:11.772 --> 12:13.774
There have been
times in my life

12:13.774 --> 12:16.944
when I have been very sad
and very scared, just like you.

12:16.944 --> 12:18.697
Did you run away?

12:18.697 --> 12:20.781
I wanted to.

12:20.781 --> 12:24.035
But I remembered that everything
happens for a reason,

12:24.035 --> 12:26.204
and whatever the reason,

12:26.204 --> 12:29.207
you and Becky
are here now with me.

12:29.207 --> 12:31.543
And you're not going anywhere

12:31.543 --> 12:32.919
until your sister
is back on her feet

12:32.919 --> 12:34.128
and well again,

12:34.128 --> 12:35.963
and that is a promise,
from me to you,

12:35.963 --> 12:37.924
no matter what anyone says.

12:37.924 --> 12:39.884
Even Dr. Burns?

12:39.884 --> 12:42.262
Even Dr. Burns.

12:55.816 --> 12:57.776
Hickam.

12:59.153 --> 13:00.947
Inspector Avery.

13:00.947 --> 13:02.616
It's good to see you
out and about.

13:02.616 --> 13:04.534
-Well, it's good to be seen.
-I hear you, uh

13:04.534 --> 13:05.868
you're taking
a leave of absence

13:05.868 --> 13:06.869
from the Mounties.

13:06.869 --> 13:08.455
That's right.

13:08.455 --> 13:10.915
Well, maybe we should sit down
and talk about your next move.

13:10.915 --> 13:12.584
My company's expanding.

13:12.584 --> 13:14.835
Might be able to use
a man with your talents

13:14.835 --> 13:15.836
in the new year.

13:15.836 --> 13:17.338
Well, that's very kind.

13:17.338 --> 13:20.341
I'm not making
any decisions just yet.

13:20.341 --> 13:21.551
Well, think about it.

13:21.551 --> 13:22.343
Gentlemen.

13:22.343 --> 13:23.762
May I join you?

13:23.762 --> 13:26.389
[Lee] Actually,
I was just leaving.

13:26.389 --> 13:27.848
Rosemary has given me a list
of things I need to get done

13:27.848 --> 13:28.933
before New Year's.

13:28.933 --> 13:30.393
Somehow, I have to figure out

13:30.393 --> 13:32.479
how to fire off five dozen
Roman candles simultaneously

13:32.479 --> 13:34.272
without burning the town down.

13:34.272 --> 13:35.774
Excuse me,
Mr. Coulter?

13:35.774 --> 13:38.318
I've drawn up a design on how
to launch those fireworks,

13:38.318 --> 13:39.778
if you'd like to take a look.

13:39.778 --> 13:41.613
Do you ever do
anything else?

13:41.613 --> 13:43.990
It's all right,
it's all right.

13:43.990 --> 13:46.159
Excuse us.
Show me the drawings.

13:46.159 --> 13:48.495
Let's go.
I'll have a look.

13:50.871 --> 13:52.873
I heard what happened
with Inspector Houston.

13:52.873 --> 13:56.294
Yes. I worked on that case
for a long time.

13:56.294 --> 13:57.878
I remember.

13:57.878 --> 13:59.631
[both, simultaneously]
I was thinking--

13:59.631 --> 14:01.341
[chuckles]

14:01.341 --> 14:03.217
-You first.
-Okay.

14:03.217 --> 14:04.511
Well, needless to say,

14:04.511 --> 14:08.389
I had a lot of time on my hands
in that jail cell.

14:08.389 --> 14:10.767
Put things in perspective.

14:10.767 --> 14:12.393
Nora...

14:13.436 --> 14:16.022
I'm sorry if I ever did
anything to hurt you.

14:16.022 --> 14:17.898
I want you to know that.

14:17.898 --> 14:19.400
I'm sorry, too.

14:19.400 --> 14:21.152
The truth is,

14:21.152 --> 14:23.655
I've not been fair to you...

14:23.655 --> 14:25.156
or to us.

14:25.156 --> 14:26.700
People make mistakes,
and sometimes,

14:26.700 --> 14:28.909
there's nothing anyone
can do about it,

14:28.909 --> 14:31.912
except let go and forgive.

14:31.912 --> 14:32.913
You really mean that?

14:32.913 --> 14:34.081
You were right.

14:34.081 --> 14:36.167
It was our son
I couldn't let go of,

14:36.167 --> 14:39.920
so I held on to you instead.

14:39.920 --> 14:42.423
It's time to start over.

14:42.423 --> 14:44.884
For both of us.

14:57.021 --> 14:58.939
Happy New Year, Bill.

14:58.939 --> 15:01.526
Happy New Year, Nora.

15:02.485 --> 15:04.904
[♪♪♪]

15:07.866 --> 15:09.784
[exhaling deeply]

15:10.910 --> 15:12.036
Are you warm enough?

15:12.036 --> 15:13.287
I'm fine.

15:13.287 --> 15:15.874
If you need an extra blanket,
you let me know.

15:15.874 --> 15:16.957
All right.

15:16.957 --> 15:18.167
Goodnight.

15:18.167 --> 15:20.002
Mrs. Stanton?

15:20.002 --> 15:23.339
My mom used to stay
until I said my bedtime prayers.

15:23.339 --> 15:24.924
Would you like me to stay?

15:26.217 --> 15:27.968
All right.

15:27.968 --> 15:29.929
You start.

15:31.972 --> 15:33.474
Dear Lord,

15:33.474 --> 15:35.976
bless Cody
and keep him safe.

15:35.976 --> 15:37.812
Let him know how much
You love him

15:37.812 --> 15:40.398
and that You will
always watch over him.

15:40.398 --> 15:41.858
And God bless my mom and dad

15:41.858 --> 15:44.068
who are with the angels
in heaven now...

15:44.068 --> 15:46.987
and please
make Becky better.

15:46.987 --> 15:47.988
Amen.

15:47.988 --> 15:49.574
Amen.

15:49.574 --> 15:51.242
Oh, I almost
forgot...

15:51.242 --> 15:54.328
God bless Mrs. Stanton, too,

15:54.328 --> 15:57.624
and tell my mom
not to worry anymore,

15:57.624 --> 15:59.500
because now there's someone
who's watching out for me.

15:59.500 --> 16:01.795
Amen... again.

16:03.003 --> 16:04.297
'Night.

16:04.297 --> 16:05.965
Goodnight.

16:08.134 --> 16:10.720
[♪♪♪]

16:16.267 --> 16:17.727
Shall we get started?

16:17.727 --> 16:19.437
Isn't Rosemary
joining us?

16:19.437 --> 16:21.815
Oh, she said
to go ahead without her.

16:21.815 --> 16:24.066
She's been very busy
entertaining that reporter,

16:24.066 --> 16:25.234
and if you ask me,

16:25.234 --> 16:26.402
something isn't quite
on the up-and-up.

16:26.402 --> 16:28.321
-Oh?
-Mr. Ward

16:28.321 --> 16:31.699
was asking
after "Mr. LeVeaux".

16:32.826 --> 16:34.869
Should be
an interesting article.

16:34.869 --> 16:36.203
Mm.

16:36.203 --> 16:38.581
Well... first things first.

16:38.581 --> 16:40.917
We have been deluged

16:40.917 --> 16:43.043
with submissions
for the memory box.

16:43.043 --> 16:45.713
There's the declaration
from the city council,

16:45.713 --> 16:48.633
changing the name of the town
to "Hope Valley,"

16:48.633 --> 16:51.678
a bible from our new church,

16:51.678 --> 16:54.305
a school photograph
of the children,

16:54.305 --> 17:00.019
a recipe from Mrs. Jackson
for "rattlesnake-and-liver pie."

17:00.019 --> 17:03.982
I think we can
misplace this one.

17:05.441 --> 17:07.568
Richard Manning
submitted his harmonica,

17:07.568 --> 17:09.570
but I'm not sure
it should be included.

17:09.570 --> 17:10.947
Have you heard him play?

17:10.947 --> 17:11.990
I have.

17:11.990 --> 17:13.366
Maybe it's better

17:13.366 --> 17:15.493
it's buried for
the next hundred years.

17:17.286 --> 17:20.080
Miss LeVeaux has submitted

17:20.080 --> 17:23.083
a copy of the Founder's Day
script she wrote,

17:23.083 --> 17:25.962
a playbill from her performance
of The Warbling Wren,

17:25.962 --> 17:29.048
a recording of her rendition of
"Let Me Call You, Sweetheart,"

17:29.048 --> 17:32.844
and... every edition
of her advice column.

17:34.220 --> 17:36.723
Oh, and her kimono
from the Mikado.

17:36.723 --> 17:40.226
Maybe we should limit
the number of submissions.

17:40.226 --> 17:42.854
Only if you volunteer
to tell her.

17:42.854 --> 17:44.230
You know,
I have to admit,

17:44.230 --> 17:47.775
I was skeptical about
all this New Year's hoopla...

17:47.775 --> 17:49.736
But I think we really need it.

17:49.736 --> 17:52.112
New Year's Eve can be
such a lonely holiday.

17:52.112 --> 17:54.156
Not this year.

17:54.156 --> 17:56.492
No one has to be alone.

17:56.492 --> 17:57.660
That's what's
always made

17:57.660 --> 17:59.620
Hope Valley
special to me.

17:59.620 --> 18:01.622
To old friends...

18:01.622 --> 18:03.917
and a new year.

18:03.917 --> 18:05.125
Hear, hear.

18:05.125 --> 18:07.086
Hear, hear!

18:08.796 --> 18:10.464
So you'll join me
for dinner, then?

18:10.464 --> 18:12.174
I'm looking
forward to it.

18:12.174 --> 18:13.217
Very good.

18:19.223 --> 18:20.767
It's nice to see
you've taken

18:20.767 --> 18:23.061
such an interest
in Nora's well-being.

18:23.061 --> 18:24.604
Someone should.

18:24.604 --> 18:25.772
You've disappeared
on her before.

18:25.772 --> 18:27.189
Ah, forgive me, Bill,

18:27.189 --> 18:28.942
but do you really think
that you're the one

18:28.942 --> 18:30.693
that should be worrying
about Nora's well-being,

18:30.693 --> 18:32.152
given how
you treated her?

18:32.152 --> 18:34.113
Easy, Henry.

18:35.489 --> 18:36.908
Tell me...

18:36.908 --> 18:39.827
you ever given any thought
how the Mounties knew

18:39.827 --> 18:43.039
you were here, working on a case
that was supposed to be closed?

18:43.039 --> 18:44.248
[chuckles]

18:44.248 --> 18:46.500
It just must get up your craw

18:46.500 --> 18:48.878
that I've been cleared
of all charges.

18:48.878 --> 18:52.172
Well, Houston has friends
in very high places, Bill.

18:52.172 --> 18:53.132
If I were you,

18:53.132 --> 18:55.718
I'd sleep with a gun
under my pillow.

18:55.718 --> 18:58.930
In fact,
I wouldn't sleep at all.

19:00.056 --> 19:02.141
[♪♪♪]

19:11.191 --> 19:12.944
All right, Rip.

19:12.944 --> 19:15.655
Look what I made for you...

19:15.655 --> 19:17.949
pot roast.

19:19.951 --> 19:22.202
It's really quite delicious.

19:22.202 --> 19:24.163
I made it myself.

19:29.585 --> 19:32.880
Mm! See?
Yummy-yummy-yummy!

19:34.132 --> 19:35.215
[sighs]

19:35.215 --> 19:38.260
What do I have to do
to get through to you?

19:38.260 --> 19:39.720
[Jack] Allow me.

19:40.596 --> 19:41.806
Rip, old boy,

19:41.806 --> 19:43.223
I think it's about time

19:43.223 --> 19:45.601
that you and I had
a heart-to-heart chat.

19:45.601 --> 19:47.227
Now, I know
this is hard for you.

19:47.227 --> 19:49.981
Up till now,
it's just been you and me,

19:49.981 --> 19:52.900
just two old bachelors,
set in our ways,

19:52.900 --> 19:54.819
laughing, scratching,

19:54.819 --> 19:56.863
walking around
in our long johns.

19:56.863 --> 19:58.990
But it's gonna to be
New Year's soon.

19:58.990 --> 20:02.242
It may not be just
the two of us for much longer.

20:02.242 --> 20:03.494
So I'm gonna need you

20:03.494 --> 20:06.413
to stop giving Miss Thatcher
such a hard time.

20:06.413 --> 20:08.749
Now, she can't
play catch like you do,

20:08.749 --> 20:10.292
and she's no good
at chasing squirrels.

20:10.292 --> 20:13.504
But she smells good...

20:13.504 --> 20:16.298
and she's pretty special to me,

20:16.298 --> 20:19.468
so she needs to be special
to you, too, okay, boy?

20:19.468 --> 20:21.804

20:31.898 --> 20:34.192
[chuckles] Good boy.

20:46.286 --> 20:48.206
This is too much!

20:48.206 --> 20:51.291
Oh, nonsense.
Please, sit.

20:51.291 --> 20:54.503
No one has treated me this way
in a long time.

20:54.503 --> 20:56.797
This is certainly the way
you deserve to be treated

20:56.797 --> 20:58.758
all the time.

21:00.426 --> 21:03.303
You were always
such a gentleman.

21:03.303 --> 21:05.305
Well, there are more than
a few people in this town

21:05.305 --> 21:07.767
who would take exception
to that statement.

21:07.767 --> 21:10.310
They don't know you
the way I do.

21:10.310 --> 21:13.147
Speaking of times gone by...

21:13.147 --> 21:14.148
[finishes pouring drinks]

21:14.148 --> 21:16.316
I wondered if...

21:16.316 --> 21:18.527
there was a chance

21:18.527 --> 21:22.240
that things could go back
to the way they were between us.

21:22.240 --> 21:25.118
I mean, being as
it's the New Year and all.

21:25.118 --> 21:27.327
I've made a clean break
from Bill.

21:27.327 --> 21:29.329
Well, that's interesting news.

21:29.329 --> 21:30.915
It needed
to be done,

21:30.915 --> 21:32.332
but I need time, Henry.

21:32.332 --> 21:33.834
I don't mean to play games,

21:33.834 --> 21:35.669
I just haven't
figured things out yet.

21:35.669 --> 21:38.422
I don't think
you're playing games, Nora.

21:38.422 --> 21:43.343
I just wanted you to know
that I would be here...

21:43.343 --> 21:45.638
whatever you decide.

21:49.349 --> 21:51.351
Excellent game, gentlemen.

21:51.351 --> 21:53.229
Dr. Burns!
It's Becky.

21:53.229 --> 21:54.521
She's burning up
with fever.

21:54.521 --> 21:56.065
Has she been
out of bed again?

21:56.065 --> 21:58.609
No. She was fine
an hour ago.

You're all right.
You're all right.

22:09.870 --> 22:11.205
How's she doing?

22:11.205 --> 22:13.166
The same.

22:16.376 --> 22:18.254
[panting deliriously]

22:18.254 --> 22:19.338
Take these.

22:19.338 --> 22:21.924
Take 'em.

22:23.176 --> 22:25.385
We have to get
her fever down fast.

22:25.385 --> 22:26.762
I need some cold compresses,

22:26.762 --> 22:29.140
and bring me some ice,
if you can find any.

22:40.109 --> 22:41.944
The sudden onset
of a high fever

22:41.944 --> 22:43.403
means that
the infection's

22:43.403 --> 22:44.989
likely caused by a parasite.

22:46.199 --> 22:48.408
I just wish
I'd caught it sooner,

22:48.408 --> 22:50.161
but her symptoms,
they weren't specific enough,

22:50.161 --> 22:51.411
and I thought
it was the flu.

22:51.411 --> 22:52.788
You couldn't
have known.

22:52.788 --> 22:55.373
I've treated her
with a tincture of quinine.

22:55.373 --> 22:57.835
We'll have to wait
and see what happens.

23:26.864 --> 23:28.448
Laura, what happened?

23:28.448 --> 23:30.743
I don't know how to draw
the spirit of New Year's.

23:30.743 --> 23:31.994
Yes, you do.

23:31.994 --> 23:34.080
Just think about what
New Year's means to you,

23:34.080 --> 23:35.455
in your heart.

23:35.455 --> 23:37.457
My dad says one year's
the same as the next.

23:37.457 --> 23:39.459
Nothing's different.

23:39.459 --> 23:41.045
Nothing changes.

23:41.045 --> 23:43.463
It can
if you want it to.

23:44.715 --> 23:46.508
What is it that
you want in the New Year

23:46.508 --> 23:48.219
that's different
from this year?

23:48.219 --> 23:50.888
I want us to be happy again.

23:53.473 --> 23:55.684
Then that's what
you need to draw.

How's Laura doing?

24:15.079 --> 24:16.496
I don't know.

24:16.496 --> 24:17.706
When her mother died,

24:17.706 --> 24:19.499
I think her father
shut out all the joy

24:19.499 --> 24:20.500
from their lives.

24:20.500 --> 24:22.295
All they do is work.

24:22.295 --> 24:24.504
Well, you have
a gift of being able

24:24.504 --> 24:26.464
to change the way
people see things.

24:26.464 --> 24:28.884
The change comes
from them, not from me.

24:28.884 --> 24:30.052
Elizabeth!

24:30.052 --> 24:31.387
I'm so glad I found you.

24:31.387 --> 24:32.512
Afternoon, Rosemary.

24:32.512 --> 24:34.640
Jack.
You and I need to chat.

24:34.640 --> 24:35.557
All right,

24:35.557 --> 24:37.268
but if it's about
the New Year's program,

24:37.268 --> 24:38.769
the children are
rehearsing every day.

24:38.769 --> 24:41.272
Perfect! Because I wanted to
go over your script with you.

24:41.272 --> 24:42.982
Maybe spice it up a bit.

24:42.982 --> 24:44.524
Give it a little polish.

24:44.524 --> 24:46.319
I know you're very busy.
Don't worry about it.

24:46.319 --> 24:47.403
Are you sure?

24:47.403 --> 24:48.612
Because I had some ideas
about the finale.

24:48.612 --> 24:49.905
I was thinking confetti--

24:49.905 --> 24:51.073

24:51.073 --> 24:52.199
I have it handled.

24:52.199 --> 24:53.491
But I--

No buts.

25:03.752 --> 25:05.712
Sure. What's
on your mind?

25:05.712 --> 25:08.466
Well, I'd like to know
why you froze me out.

25:08.466 --> 25:10.550
Not sure I know what
you're talking about.

25:10.550 --> 25:11.677
Sure, you do.

25:11.677 --> 25:15.431
Why'd you keep it
a secret about Houston?

25:15.431 --> 25:18.100
It doesn't matter.

25:18.100 --> 25:20.269
Matters to me.

25:26.984 --> 25:29.569
I've known Houston's
been dirty for years,

25:29.569 --> 25:31.030
I just couldn't
prove it.

25:31.030 --> 25:32.572
You should've told me
from the beginning.

25:32.572 --> 25:33.573
It was
too dangerous.

25:33.573 --> 25:35.993
Bill, I have a job to do.

25:35.993 --> 25:38.536
I wasn't gonna let your mother
lose a husband and a son.

25:38.536 --> 25:40.039
That's not
your decision to make.

25:40.039 --> 25:41.081
Maybe not.

25:41.081 --> 25:44.084
You did exactly what
I would have done, Jack.

if I said anything
wrong the other day.

Oh. You don't have
to apologize to me.

I just want you to know

26:11.362 --> 26:13.364
that your daughter
needs you very much.

26:13.364 --> 26:15.408
She misses her mother.

26:15.408 --> 26:16.658
I know.

But you still
have each other.

Mrs. Stanton said
I could play outside

before dinner,

27:07.876 --> 27:10.003

27:12.465 --> 27:14.508
Okay. About what?

27:14.508 --> 27:16.218
My sister.

27:16.218 --> 27:17.886
She promised
she would come to see me

27:17.886 --> 27:19.721
at the New Year's program
tonight,

27:19.721 --> 27:21.681

27:21.681 --> 27:24.143
I'm sorry to hear that.

27:24.143 --> 27:25.936
Do you think you could
say a prayer for her?

Because I don't think
I'm doing it right.

27:28.688 --> 27:31.066
I'm sure
you're doing just fine.

27:31.066 --> 27:32.818
You're a pastor,

27:32.818 --> 27:35.446
so maybe God
listens to you better.

27:35.446 --> 27:38.031
No, God listens to both of us
just the same.

Well, when my mom and dad died,

27:40.700 --> 27:44.204
the pastor at our church said
that God needed them in heaven,

I have left.

28:23.327 --> 28:25.745
The day my father died,

28:25.745 --> 28:28.123
my mom went on
as if nothing happened.

That must've been very hard.

28:36.298 --> 28:38.717
Kids need time to grieve.

28:39.759 --> 28:43.055
They also need to know
when it's all right to move on.

28:43.055 --> 28:45.807
I remember...

28:45.807 --> 28:48.143

it was right to have fun.

And when I see her and her dad,
I understand it,

28:56.402 --> 28:59.779
and it brings back
a lot of memories for me.

28:59.779 --> 29:02.115
Of course it does.
