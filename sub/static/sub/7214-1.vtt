01:09.069 --> 01:13.733
(boy) Sharkboy was not always
half shark. half boy.

01:13.807 --> 01:18.176
He was a marine biologist -
or. at least. in training.

01:18.244 --> 01:20.735
His father studied great white sharks

01:20.814 --> 01:26.252
and called his son "Sharkboy" because of
how much he loved to care for the sharks.

01:26.319 --> 01:30.153
He made them sushi
and had given them all names.

01:30.223 --> 01:33.954
Goodmilk. Peggy. Eggbat...

01:34.761 --> 01:36.786
and Crackett.

01:40.900 --> 01:45.269
But one day
an incredible. mysterious storm appeared.

01:45.805 --> 01:48.239
It swept away the entire laboratory.

01:48.308 --> 01:49.434
Sharkboy!

01:49.509 --> 01:53.570
Thanks to their life rafts.
Sharkboy and his father survived.

01:53.646 --> 01:56.547
But they survived
on different sides of the wreckage.

01:56.616 --> 01:58.880
each floating off in a different direction.

01:58.952 --> 02:00.283
Sharkboy!

02:00.353 --> 02:03.652
Sharkboy was completely alone.

02:05.992 --> 02:08.483
Almost completely.

02:09.128 --> 02:12.462
But one of the sharks recognized him.

02:12.532 --> 02:14.329
Hey, it's Sharkboy.

02:14.400 --> 02:18.097
Don't take a bite outta him, boys -
he's a friend.

02:18.805 --> 02:24.710
They took Sharkboy to their cave home.
where he'd be safe and dry.

02:27.847 --> 02:30.714
His new family were sharks.

02:33.586 --> 02:36.521
Hundreds of sharks.

02:41.394 --> 02:44.124
The sharks raised him
as one of their own.

02:44.197 --> 02:47.030
training him in the ways of the shark.

02:47.100 --> 02:49.762
You must keep moving to survive.

02:49.836 --> 02:52.669
Always go forward, never back.

02:53.673 --> 02:57.234
To live by instinct and instinct alone.

03:01.314 --> 03:06.183
Eventually he grew gills.
and sharp talons for claws.

03:06.252 --> 03:08.914
His teeth sharpened themselves
to a point.

03:08.988 --> 03:14.016
He grew fins - all sorts of fins.

03:14.093 --> 03:16.288
But that was years ago.

03:16.362 --> 03:20.958
I first met Sharkboy
while fishing on the dock this summer.

03:31.277 --> 03:33.677
He seemed lost.

03:33.746 --> 03:36.476
- You have to get a job!
- No, I have a job!

03:36.549 --> 03:39.518
So I snuck him home...

03:39.586 --> 03:41.850
Then maybe you should just leave.

03:41.921 --> 03:44.913
... when my parents
were too busy to notice.

03:47.227 --> 03:50.458
I kept him fed and in water.

03:51.331 --> 03:55.791
He had been traveling the universe
in search of his father.

03:55.868 --> 04:02.068
He told me of his latest adventures
on a planet so cool it makes you drool.

04:02.675 --> 04:06.873
He said I too
could go to Planet Drool someday.

04:07.847 --> 04:11.943
Then one night
I was visited by a glowing light.

04:12.018 --> 04:17.581
An amazing girl with purple flames for hair
and skin of molten lava rock appeared.

04:17.656 --> 04:19.147
I called her...

04:19.225 --> 04:21.192
Lavagirl.

04:21.261 --> 04:24.788
She smiled at me.
for that seemed to be her name.

04:24.864 --> 04:28.960
She told me she needed Sharkboy
to return to Planet Drool with her.

04:29.035 --> 04:31.663
for a great crisis was developing.

04:31.738 --> 04:37.005
She asked if I could go with them.
I told her. "I have school tomorrow. "

04:37.076 --> 04:40.876
She gave me a sad look
and flamed away.

04:40.947 --> 04:43.415
taking Sharkboy with her.

04:44.684 --> 04:48.780
I haven 't seen Sharkboy
or Lavagirl since then.

04:50.456 --> 04:53.448
And that'swhat I did this summer..

04:55.662 --> 04:57.323
(laughter)

04:57.397 --> 04:59.092
(teacher) Enough!

04:59.198 --> 05:03.965
Someone is picking that up.
And it's not gonna be me!

05:04.937 --> 05:08.429
We were supposed to tell true stories.

05:08.508 --> 05:10.476
That is a true story.

05:10.543 --> 05:15.537
- Does Lavagirl have special powers?
- There's no such thing as Lavagirl.

05:16.015 --> 05:18.245
She can...

05:20.520 --> 05:23.751
She can shoot lava out of her hands.

05:23.823 --> 05:25.085
Cool.

05:25.158 --> 05:27.888
How many people think
Max's story is true?

05:28.494 --> 05:30.655
- Not true.
- Made up.

05:30.730 --> 05:33.597
- Not true.
- It's just a made-up story.

05:34.867 --> 05:38.894
If it's true, why don't you bring
Sharkboy and Lavagirl to class tomorrow?

05:38.971 --> 05:41.565
They went away.
I don't know where they went.

05:41.641 --> 05:43.131
Have a seat, Max.

05:43.209 --> 05:45.541
Linus, you're next.

05:48.114 --> 05:50.207
(laughter)

05:52.118 --> 05:57.146
This summer, I met a new friend...
who was half dork, half boy.

05:57.223 --> 05:59.384
I called him Dorkboy.

06:00.326 --> 06:02.089
But his real name was Max.

06:02.161 --> 06:07.997
We had him for dinner, but he stunk
so bad that we all blew chunks.

06:09.535 --> 06:12.231
- That's enough, Linus.
- (school bell)

06:12.305 --> 06:15.763
Linus, Max, stay.

06:15.842 --> 06:17.537
Come on, Mr. E!

06:17.610 --> 06:19.805
Class, what's my name?

06:19.879 --> 06:23.076
Mr. Electricidad.

06:23.149 --> 06:25.743
Mr. Electricidad, exactly.

06:25.818 --> 06:30.949
Not Mr. Electric,
not Mr. Electrici-tha-tha-tha-tha.

06:32.125 --> 06:36.459
Linus, you just earned a minus
for your behavior today.

06:36.529 --> 06:40.761
This is a new year.
Do you think you can be friends?

06:40.833 --> 06:42.095
(both) No.

06:42.168 --> 06:45.262
Then it's been decided:
you'll be the best of friends.

06:45.338 --> 06:49.206
Which means
no more picking on Max, Linus.

06:50.610 --> 06:52.237
Max.

06:52.311 --> 06:56.077
You're in the fourth grade.
There are some good kids in this class.

06:56.149 --> 06:59.585
Find them. Make friends with them.

06:59.652 --> 07:04.589
Dreaming keeps you from seeing
what's right here in front of you.

07:04.657 --> 07:08.855
This isn't a dream.
This is the real world.

07:12.598 --> 07:14.828
Lost my train of thought.

07:14.901 --> 07:17.062
No dreaming. Got it.

07:17.136 --> 07:19.001
I'll try harder.

07:19.071 --> 07:21.232
What do you have there?

07:24.110 --> 07:25.975
It's my dream journal.

07:26.045 --> 07:29.208
It has all of my most precious dreams in it.

07:29.282 --> 07:32.911
I'll never part with it
for as long as I live.

07:34.086 --> 07:36.486
You're a good kid, Max.

07:43.930 --> 07:45.864
Max!

07:45.932 --> 07:48.958
Let's be imaginary friends.

07:49.035 --> 07:53.495
You can try and hang with us...
and we'll pretend you don't exist!

07:54.140 --> 07:58.201
Check it out.
Sharkboy gets shocked by electric eels,

07:58.277 --> 08:01.405
and then they feed on his cooked flesh.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.346
Wow, Linus.

08:03.950 --> 08:06.783
Your skills are... weak.

08:12.024 --> 08:14.049
Ohh...

08:16.496 --> 08:19.329
I'm gonna burst your bubble, Dream Boy.

08:23.135 --> 08:25.035
You're dead!

08:25.104 --> 08:27.231
Get the book!

08:38.484 --> 08:40.418
Give me the book.

08:40.486 --> 08:44.479
Hand over the book,
or you'll visit the dream world!

09:01.707 --> 09:03.607
Ooh...

09:05.177 --> 09:06.940
Agh-haa...

09:07.013 --> 09:09.174
All right! Gotit!

09:10.049 --> 09:11.277
(groans)

09:11.951 --> 09:15.580
I'll bring you a revised edition tomorrow.

09:22.562 --> 09:25.190
(rumble of thunder)

09:32.305 --> 09:35.570
- (voice #1) Max. wake up!
- (voice #2) Dream. Max.

09:35.641 --> 09:40.806
- Open your eyes. Max.
- Eyes open. and dream. Stay dreaming.

09:40.880 --> 09:42.814
Wake up!

10:13.713 --> 10:15.544
(gasps)

10:17.984 --> 10:20.043
Sharkboy!

10:21.621 --> 10:23.612
And Lavagirll

10:25.491 --> 10:27.959
(chimes tinkle)

10:28.327 --> 10:29.851
Hyah!

10:30.696 --> 10:32.425
Max!

10:32.498 --> 10:34.966
My cookies! My giant cookies!

10:35.034 --> 10:39.494
What are you doing baking sweets? You
know what happens when he eats sugar.

10:39.572 --> 10:41.631
I baked them for his class.

10:41.707 --> 10:45.108
So you could make friends at school,
and now you've eaten all of them.

10:45.177 --> 10:47.042
No, it was Sharkboy and Lavagirl!

10:47.113 --> 10:51.675
Look - this one has shark bites,
and this one is singed.

10:51.751 --> 10:54.618
(mother) There's no such thing
as Sharkboy and Lavagirl.

10:54.687 --> 10:57.155
Well, I believe him.

10:57.223 --> 11:02.126
Your mother's right. When you go to sleep
and close your eyes, they may come back.

11:02.228 --> 11:07.029
But when you open 'em again, Sharkgirl
and Lavaboy'll be... (whistles)...outta here.

11:07.066 --> 11:10.263
- But...
- Shh. Mouth closed, eyes closed.

11:10.336 --> 11:12.827
- Now?
- Yes, now.

11:17.209 --> 11:21.373
You can wait till you're in bed
to close your eyes, Max.

11:23.282 --> 11:25.682
Kids need their dreams.

11:26.452 --> 11:29.979
Kids... need to grow up!

11:35.928 --> 11:39.625
He's not making any friends
with these cookies!

11:42.368 --> 11:45.895
There's no such thing
as Sharkboy and Lavagirl.

11:46.072 --> 11:49.530
There's no such thing
as Sharkboy and Lavagirl.

11:50.209 --> 11:52.234
Yes, there is.

11:53.345 --> 11:55.472
Stupid plugs!

11:56.215 --> 12:02.381
Please don't let me have to go to school.
They'll make fun of me, I know it!

12:02.455 --> 12:07.722
I wish I could just escape this loser world
and go to Planet Drool.

12:07.793 --> 12:11.126
Games and toys and laughs and fun...

12:11.897 --> 12:13.888
(thunderclap)

12:14.700 --> 12:21.538
May there be terrible storms,
rain, sleet, snow, tornadoes...

12:22.775 --> 12:28.645
so I can lay here all day tomorrow
and dream of Drool.

12:39.458 --> 12:42.450
(alarm)

12:54.774 --> 12:57.436
Guess I didn't dream hard enough.

12:57.977 --> 13:01.413
There are plenty of good opportunities.
You just need to look.

13:01.480 --> 13:03.948
Ooh, traffic engineer!

13:07.286 --> 13:08.514
Hey.

13:08.587 --> 13:11.385
I was cleaning out my closet
and look what I found.

13:11.457 --> 13:14.449
Remember Tobor?
The robot you tried to build?

13:14.527 --> 13:17.155
Why were you cleaning out your closet?

13:17.229 --> 13:19.459
I had to find one of these.

13:19.532 --> 13:23.468
- Is Mom making you get a real job again?
- Writing is a real job.

13:25.571 --> 13:28.563
- When it pays.
- Max, I'm walking you to school today.

13:28.641 --> 13:32.509
So what do you say?
Wanna finish making Tobor?

13:33.179 --> 13:34.703
It won't work.

13:34.780 --> 13:39.046
- Well, how do you know?
- 'Cause you told me it wouldn't.

13:40.152 --> 13:42.177
I did?

13:44.223 --> 13:48.683
I'm sorry.
I should've never said that.

13:48.761 --> 13:51.389
It's OK. You were right.

13:52.865 --> 13:54.958
Dumb idea.

13:57.636 --> 14:00.264
How did these happen?

14:00.339 --> 14:02.807
The grass was dead anyway.

14:02.875 --> 14:05.173
Why are you so morbid?

14:05.244 --> 14:09.840
I just wish anything could happen
so I wouldn't have to go to school today.

14:09.915 --> 14:12.315
That's not realistic, Max.

14:12.384 --> 14:16.514
It's bad enough your father's head
is in the clouds, but not you too, OK?

14:16.589 --> 14:20.252
Just push that dream aside and move on.

14:20.326 --> 14:25.559
Like with your dream?
The one about you and Dad and me?

14:25.631 --> 14:27.758
Well, I do have a dream about us,

14:27.833 --> 14:32.202
but, as I'm sure you've been noticing lately,
your father and I are just...

14:32.271 --> 14:36.037
Well, we're... not compatible.

14:36.108 --> 14:41.444
Sorry. I don't mean to dump all this on you
right before you have to go to school, but...

14:41.513 --> 14:43.344
school's waiting.

14:43.415 --> 14:45.747
Did we have to move so close to school?

14:45.818 --> 14:48.719
Your father thought
we'd save money on gas.

14:48.787 --> 14:54.191
Come right home after school today, 'cause
there's some things we need to talk about.

14:54.260 --> 14:56.160
I love you.

14:57.863 --> 15:02.061
I wish anything could happen
so I wouldn't have to come home today.

15:04.536 --> 15:07.130
- Hey, look, it's Dream Boy!
- (school bell)

15:12.645 --> 15:15.876
Who knows where tornadoes come from?

15:16.615 --> 15:21.518
Well, when cold air mixes with hot air,
it can form a tornado,

15:21.587 --> 15:25.353
as the hot and cold chase each other
around and around and around.

15:25.424 --> 15:30.418
I dreamt of a story kind of like Sharkboy
and Lavagirl - lce Girl and Dream Boy.

15:30.496 --> 15:34.159
Her powers come from her crystal heart.

15:34.967 --> 15:36.559
No more fairy tales.

15:36.635 --> 15:39.035
Piranha Girl and Beluga Boy.

15:39.104 --> 15:41.629
Plastic Boy and Metal Girl.

15:41.707 --> 15:43.641
Barf Boy and Vomit Girl.

15:43.709 --> 15:46.872
Does everyone hear me?
I'm a teacher, right?

15:46.946 --> 15:49.437
Wrong. I'm an awakener.

15:49.515 --> 15:54.214
Only I'm finding it more and more difficult
to keep my class... awake.

15:54.286 --> 15:54.945
(sneezes)

15:55.020 --> 15:57.853
No recess again for you, Marissa -
too many allergies.

15:57.923 --> 16:00.756
There are more boogers on your work
than there is work.

16:00.826 --> 16:03.488
I'm just cold.

16:03.562 --> 16:08.124
I'll be happy to change places with you.
It's a lot warmer back there in my spot.

16:08.200 --> 16:10.600
But l... have to sit up front.

16:10.669 --> 16:14.070
It's just that you're sitting
right under the vent.

16:14.139 --> 16:17.973
- It's August and you're sneezing.
- You're gonna get me in trouble.

16:18.043 --> 16:20.034
Max.

16:21.280 --> 16:24.340
Are you... trying to make real friends?

16:24.416 --> 16:26.646
Trying, like you told me to.

16:26.719 --> 16:30.485
That's good.
Just not with my daughter, OK?

16:32.758 --> 16:35.659
No! It wasn't like that. It's just...

16:35.728 --> 16:37.958
Sit down, Max.

16:45.070 --> 16:47.197
(school bell)

16:47.840 --> 16:51.241
- Give me back my journal!
- Class has begun. Everyone in your seats.

16:51.310 --> 16:54.507
- Linus took my journal!
- I did not!

16:54.580 --> 16:57.378
Minus! I mean, Linus.

16:57.449 --> 17:02.079
You get a minus for misconduct.
Give Max back his journal.

17:03.255 --> 17:06.849
One more time, Linus, and we'll have to
change your name to Minus.

17:14.833 --> 17:17.199
He ruined my dream journal!

17:17.269 --> 17:20.534
I did not! Mr. Electric,
send him to the principal's office

17:20.606 --> 17:23.074
and have him expelled!

17:23.142 --> 17:26.406
You're in my class,
not the other way around!

17:26.478 --> 17:30.380
I know everything
and you know nothing!

17:30.449 --> 17:35.250
At the end of class,
both of you report to the principal's office!

17:35.320 --> 17:36.947
With your parents!

17:37.456 --> 17:39.117
(wind howls)

17:48.267 --> 17:50.326
(screaming)

18:00.045 --> 18:01.945
Everybody down!

18:15.661 --> 18:17.629
It's them!

18:21.200 --> 18:22.599
(squelching)

18:27.706 --> 18:30.072
I'm looking for Max.

18:39.751 --> 18:41.651
She's hot!

18:45.190 --> 18:46.748
(kids) Whoa!

18:47.259 --> 18:50.456
We need your help, Max.
Come with us.

18:52.564 --> 18:54.429
What do I have to do?

18:54.500 --> 18:57.264
Go with us to Planet Drool.
We'll explain on the way.

18:57.336 --> 18:59.099
We're going to Planet Drool?

18:59.204 --> 19:00.865
(scratching/screeching)

19:04.376 --> 19:07.504
It's my home planet.
Just outside our solar system.

19:07.579 --> 19:10.912
You should know, Max - you made it up.

19:14.486 --> 19:16.681
- I can't go with you.
- Why not?

19:16.755 --> 19:21.215
Because you're not real.
Both of you are just a dream.

19:22.494 --> 19:26.487
And when I open my eyes, you'll be gone.

19:32.171 --> 19:34.366
We're still here, Max.

19:34.439 --> 19:40.309
If you wanna stop the darkness
from destroying our worlds, come with us.

19:41.046 --> 19:43.139
You better go with them.

19:45.450 --> 19:48.078
OK... I'll go.

19:52.157 --> 19:55.354
Everyone follow me
and we'll find shelter.

19:55.427 --> 20:00.421
I can't believe I'm finally getting
to ditch this place and go to Planet Drool!

20:00.499 --> 20:02.399
How are we getting there?

20:14.112 --> 20:16.307
Put these on, everybody.

20:16.381 --> 20:20.340
Blue goggles for the boys,
pink for the girls.

20:20.419 --> 20:23.115
Do you have another pair of boy goggles?

20:23.722 --> 20:25.280
Uh-uh.

20:28.327 --> 20:30.921
So, how do you fly it?

20:30.996 --> 20:33.487
- You don't know?
- Duh!

20:33.565 --> 20:35.965
That's sort of been the whole problem!

20:37.369 --> 20:39.394
You press go.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.775
(whimpers)

20:57.689 --> 21:02.217
- Now, how do you fly it?
- It's got an autopilot.

21:02.294 --> 21:04.990
You just thought of everything,
didn't you, Max?

21:05.063 --> 21:07.190
Not exactly.

21:07.266 --> 21:12.670
- How do we land it?
- That's the part I never thought of!

21:13.105 --> 21:16.302
Jupiter... Saturn... Neptune...

21:16.775 --> 21:19.710
You might wanna hold on to something.

21:40.832 --> 21:43.300
Recognize your dream world, Max?

21:43.368 --> 21:45.700
Not really.

21:45.771 --> 21:49.298
I feel like I should,
but I just don't.

21:49.374 --> 21:51.865
It's affecting him too.

21:51.943 --> 21:54.241
I thought he would just remember.

21:54.313 --> 21:58.682
- Remember what?
- Your dreams. This planet?

21:59.318 --> 22:01.218
Us.

22:01.286 --> 22:03.846
Your powers.

22:03.922 --> 22:07.517
- I have powers?
- More than any of us.

22:07.592 --> 22:09.958
Don't you know that?

22:10.028 --> 22:14.590
Everything that is or was,
began with a dream.

22:14.666 --> 22:19.228
And you dreamt us, Max.
Us and this whole place.

22:19.304 --> 22:20.293
I did?

22:20.372 --> 22:24.035
Every dream you ever had
landed right here on Planet Drool.

22:24.109 --> 22:26.771
Why is it so dark?

22:26.845 --> 22:30.576
The planet is dying.
It began yesterday.

22:30.649 --> 22:33.311
What's the calculation, Sharkboy?

22:34.519 --> 22:38.455
45 minutes till the darkness
destroys Planet Drool.

22:38.523 --> 22:44.018
We didn't go to Earth to save you. Max.
We need you to save Planet Drool.

22:45.797 --> 22:47.458
But how

22:47.532 --> 22:50.501
The Dream Lair
is on the other side of the planet.

22:50.569 --> 22:54.335
That's where your dreams are going bad.
We have to go there and reverse it.

22:54.406 --> 22:58.035
We have to travel through the Passage
of Time, catch the Train of Thought,

22:58.110 --> 23:00.271
swim down the Stream of Consciousness

23:00.345 --> 23:04.281
and skate across the Sea of Confusion -
now covered in ice.

23:04.349 --> 23:07.910
Why'd you do that, Max?
Why'd you freeze the ocean?

23:07.986 --> 23:09.248
I...

23:09.721 --> 23:10.745
Ouch!

23:10.822 --> 23:13.518
Max didn't mean to do it.
Did you, Max?

23:13.592 --> 23:18.689
Max is a good boy, otherwise
you and I would be evil, and we're not evil.

23:18.764 --> 23:21.198
I'm not evil, am l, Max?

23:21.266 --> 23:23.166
I don't think so.

23:23.235 --> 23:26.534
That's why we brought you here -
to put things back in order.

23:26.605 --> 23:30.166
We just have to stay positive.
It's not the end of the world.

23:30.242 --> 23:32.267
Not yet, it's not.

23:32.344 --> 23:33.641
(thunderclap)

23:34.846 --> 23:37.440
The darkness! Run!

23:38.383 --> 23:40.248
This is like a bad dream!

23:40.318 --> 23:45.381
Oh, yeah? Just wait till you meet Mr.
Electric! He's the worst bad dream yet!

23:56.835 --> 23:59.065
Where is everyone?

23:59.171 --> 24:02.732
- Mostly trapped on Mount Neverrest.
- By Mr. Electric.

24:02.774 --> 24:06.642
But Planet Drool's a place for kids
to dream and have endless fun!

24:07.846 --> 24:11.111
It's endless fun, all right.
Once you get on...

24:13.385 --> 24:15.216
(screaming)

24:15.287 --> 24:16.982
...you can't get off.

24:17.055 --> 24:20.718
Kids aren't allowed to rest,
'cause if they rest, they sleep,

24:20.792 --> 24:22.919
and if they sleep, they dream.

24:22.994 --> 24:26.259
- And if they dream...
- It takes power away from Mr. Electric.

24:26.331 --> 24:28.993
But we're gonna stop him
with our secret weapon.

24:29.067 --> 24:32.161
Shouldn't we save those kids first?

24:36.608 --> 24:38.599
(hissing)

24:48.386 --> 24:50.650
Why can't I do that?

24:55.093 --> 24:57.493
(screaming)

25:04.236 --> 25:07.069
Lavagirl! Hooray!

25:24.856 --> 25:28.053
Who knows where Mr. Electric is hiding?

25:29.861 --> 25:31.692
Everyone?

25:31.763 --> 25:36.564
They're not raising their hands.
You're all upside down.

25:38.803 --> 25:40.566
Ah.

25:40.639 --> 25:44.507
(booming voice) Who is stopping
my unstoppable coasters?

25:46.211 --> 25:48.941
- Back in your seats!
- Go! Run! Hide!

25:49.014 --> 25:51.676
- Let's get outta here!
- Everyone back in your seats!

25:51.750 --> 25:53.684
Who's Mr. Electric?

25:53.752 --> 25:59.884
He's supposed to provide light to the
planet. but all he brings now is darkness.

25:59.958 --> 26:02.051
Fun has begun!

26:02.127 --> 26:04.425
(sinister laugh)

26:19.044 --> 26:21.035
He's taking us up!

26:27.285 --> 26:31.085
My home! At half its normal power.

26:38.697 --> 26:41.165
He's taking us down.

26:41.232 --> 26:43.427
(Max whimpers)

26:47.439 --> 26:49.339
Show time!

27:04.122 --> 27:06.488
Keep playing! Never stop!

27:06.558 --> 27:11.120
Games and toys and laughs...
hey-hey-hey... and fun!

27:15.433 --> 27:19.802
Well, well, well.
If it isn't Sharkboy and Lavagirl.

27:19.871 --> 27:26.401
What are you doing halting my endless-fun
coaster and infiltrating my lair?

27:26.478 --> 27:28.605
We don't need permission from you.

27:28.680 --> 27:30.238
Fiery!

27:30.315 --> 27:34.775
I don't believe we've met.
I'm Mr. Electric!

27:34.853 --> 27:38.482
Why are you bringing misery to our planet?
You're supposed to be running it.

27:38.556 --> 27:44.324
(mimics) You're supposed to be running it.
I am running it - right into the ground.

27:44.396 --> 27:46.990
- Those are my orders.
- Who ordered that?

27:47.065 --> 27:52.162
No school, no discipline, no rules.
And, most important, no dreams.

27:52.237 --> 27:54.296
Dreams can destroy you, can't they?

27:54.372 --> 27:57.535
- My instincts tell me that is so.
- Really?

27:57.609 --> 28:03.047
- That's why we have to stop you.
- You and what army?

28:08.987 --> 28:11.080
- Now
- Now.

28:28.106 --> 28:31.769
Ha-ha-ha-haa! Pee-pee-pee-pee...

28:56.067 --> 28:57.898
Feel the burn!

28:58.002 --> 28:59.560
Agh...

29:04.042 --> 29:06.875
Not for real. Aaah!

29:16.588 --> 29:18.351
Ha-ha!

29:42.313 --> 29:45.976
Internal radar, shark-like reflexes...
You're amazing!

29:46.050 --> 29:49.076
But is it enough to defeat Mr. Electric?

29:49.154 --> 29:52.419
We have our secret weapon, remember?

29:53.691 --> 29:57.593
Did you really believe you could stop me?

29:57.662 --> 29:59.459
Oh... Ah...

29:59.531 --> 30:02.694
I knowwe can't. But he can.

30:02.767 --> 30:04.792
Take it away, Max.

30:08.873 --> 30:12.604
- Show him what you're made of, Max.
- What am I supposed to do?

30:14.078 --> 30:17.570
- I told you this would happen.
- I thought he would just remember.

30:17.649 --> 30:18.980
Remember what?!

30:20.585 --> 30:22.951
The dream. Remember the dream.

30:23.021 --> 30:25.546
I don't remember half my dreams.

30:27.425 --> 30:30.053
That's why I write them
in my dream journal.

30:33.898 --> 30:37.026
What half of your dreams
do you remember?

30:37.101 --> 30:39.069
This one I remember.

30:39.137 --> 30:41.105
Where are you taking us?

30:41.172 --> 30:45.666
Where all useless dreams go -
to the Dream Graveyard!

30:47.278 --> 30:49.109
Whoa!

30:50.548 --> 30:52.140
Ploop!

30:58.289 --> 30:59.950
Cuckoo!

31:00.024 --> 31:01.321
(cuckoos)

31:03.127 --> 31:06.824
Well, at least we're on
the Passage of Time.

31:06.898 --> 31:08.866
Maybe it'll take us to the Dream Lair.

31:08.933 --> 31:13.529
(Sharkboy) It's going in the wrong
direction. The Dream Lair's that way.

31:14.739 --> 31:16.707
What's in the Dream Lair?

31:16.774 --> 31:19.834
It's where all the dreams
that fuel Planet Drool are stored.

31:19.911 --> 31:21.902
But they're being destroyed.

31:21.980 --> 31:24.574
- How
- That's what we have to find out.

31:24.649 --> 31:28.244
Soon even Sharkboy and l
will cease to exist.

31:28.319 --> 31:29.809
Duck!

31:29.888 --> 31:31.583
(quacks)

31:33.625 --> 31:37.220
Max, where is your dream journal?

31:37.295 --> 31:39.092
Great thinking, Sharkie!

31:39.163 --> 31:43.497
We can read his dreams out loud
and turn everything back to the way it was.

31:43.568 --> 31:46.469
I may even realize my true identity.

31:47.138 --> 31:49.129
I threw it away.

31:50.575 --> 31:53.009
My journal's back on Earth.

31:57.482 --> 32:00.076
We really thought
you were the answer, Max.

32:00.151 --> 32:03.518
Don't listen to him. He's just upset
because you didn't show up

32:03.588 --> 32:07.786
and make him king of the ocean,
with a giant fish army to back him up.

32:07.859 --> 32:09.417
Look who's talking!

32:09.494 --> 32:12.986
You thought you'd find a great use
for your powers and heal the planet.

32:13.064 --> 32:18.058
Max thought his dream world would be
a happy place. We've all been duped.

32:19.570 --> 32:21.060
Ohh!

32:28.413 --> 32:30.881
I think you broke my fin.

32:32.317 --> 32:34.080
Sorry.

32:34.152 --> 32:36.450
(Sharkboy growls)

32:38.289 --> 32:42.919
Hey, you! I see you hiding!
Come back here!

32:44.262 --> 32:46.753
I was awakened!

32:47.432 --> 32:48.626
I'm sorry.

32:48.700 --> 32:52.261
Did all the children
from Mount Neverrest escape?

32:52.337 --> 32:55.704
It was Sharkboy and Lavagirl.
But I took care of it - see?

32:55.773 --> 32:57.638
Someone was with them?

32:57.742 --> 33:01.200
Just another child afraid of
his own shadow. No threat to us.

33:01.245 --> 33:03.907
I banished him to the Dream Graveyard.

33:03.982 --> 33:07.543
Where old dreams lie?
He could find an ally!

33:07.618 --> 33:13.181
I told you, every dream must be smashed,
every child captured!

33:13.257 --> 33:16.715
You want him back,
we'll simply track him when he falls asleep.

33:16.794 --> 33:20.286
Fool! He's the Daydreamer.

33:20.365 --> 33:24.825
And the moment he realizes it
will be the moment of our doom!

33:24.902 --> 33:26.529
Now what do you want me to do?

33:26.604 --> 33:29.698
Bring me the boy
before he discovers his true powers

33:29.774 --> 33:32.504
and tears my new kingdom apart!

33:33.244 --> 33:36.441
Plugs, redirect the darkness.

33:36.514 --> 33:38.379
And...

33:41.386 --> 33:44.753
bring me the Plughounds!

33:46.090 --> 33:48.854
- (barking)
- (chuckles)

33:52.063 --> 33:55.226
We'll never find our way
out of this graveyard.

33:55.299 --> 33:58.200
Darkness! Headed this way!

33:59.303 --> 34:00.930
Sit down, Max.

34:01.005 --> 34:03.473
- What for?
- Close your eyes and dream.

34:03.541 --> 34:07.272
If Max can't remember his dreams,
maybe he can redream them.

34:07.345 --> 34:09.438
He could dream us out of here.

34:09.514 --> 34:11.675
Dream, Max.

34:13.985 --> 34:16.418
Now, what do you see?

34:16.487 --> 34:22.483
I see a... giant...
chocolate-chunk marshmallow cookie...

34:23.226 --> 34:26.060
with lots of warm milk.

34:27.398 --> 34:30.925
- Sorry. I'm starving.
- Here's some food.

34:31.002 --> 34:35.530
- You're not gonna like that.
- I'm so hungry I could eat lava rocks.

34:35.973 --> 34:37.634
(crunching)

34:37.708 --> 34:39.699
(train horn)

34:41.379 --> 34:43.176
(huskily) What is that?!

34:43.246 --> 34:44.714
Lava rocks.

34:44.782 --> 34:47.512
Here, have some real food.
Fresh sushi.

34:47.585 --> 34:50.246
- lt'll knock you right out.
- That's not fresh.

34:50.321 --> 34:52.687
I'm not even sure that's sushi anymore.

34:52.757 --> 34:56.625
- It's just a few weeks old.
- I'll cook it for you.

34:59.864 --> 35:00.853
Oops.

35:00.932 --> 35:03.196
It's OK. I'm not that hungry anymore.

35:03.267 --> 35:06.828
Let me just rest a moment.
Maybe I can sleep.

35:08.773 --> 35:11.435
It's getting closer.

35:11.509 --> 35:14.603
(bubbly squeaks/faint happy singing)

35:14.679 --> 35:16.909
Get outta here!

35:19.817 --> 35:22.547
Max, I know you've got a lot to figure out,

35:22.620 --> 35:27.455
but if you happen to dream about who I am
and how I fit into this world,

35:27.525 --> 35:29.425
it would really be helpful for me...

35:29.494 --> 35:33.521
No distractions. You steer him off course,
we could be lost in a sea of dreams.

35:33.598 --> 35:36.999
- I'm sorry. I'm desperate.
- Focus on the problem at hand.

35:37.068 --> 35:40.663
Max needs to dream us out of here,
so how about I put him to sleep?

35:40.738 --> 35:44.435
- No, Sharkboy.
- Just one punch. He'll be out like a light.

35:48.179 --> 35:52.707
I've seen this before.
It's on the tip of my... finger.

35:53.317 --> 35:55.615
It's a hand!

35:56.754 --> 35:58.381
It is a hand.

36:00.258 --> 36:02.249
Ahand?

36:03.094 --> 36:04.959
Anotherhand.

36:05.029 --> 36:06.257
Yep?

36:06.330 --> 36:08.389
- It's Tobor!
- Who?

36:08.466 --> 36:11.663
Tobor! I dreamt him up when I was a kid -

36:11.736 --> 36:14.762
a robot that could help me
with my homework.

36:14.839 --> 36:19.799
I tried to build him once. Everyone
kept telling me he would never work.

36:19.877 --> 36:23.938
So here he is - a forgotten dream
in the Dream Graveyard.

36:24.015 --> 36:26.711
Maybe he can help us.

36:26.784 --> 36:29.252
He's supposed to be very smart.

36:29.320 --> 36:31.515
Tobor, awake!

36:32.323 --> 36:34.018
Yes?

36:34.091 --> 36:35.718
He works!

36:35.793 --> 36:38.956
- We can ask him anything now.
- Let me, let me!

36:39.030 --> 36:42.363
Tell me something about me.
I'm clueless.

36:42.433 --> 36:46.995
Actually, you are extremely bright.

36:47.838 --> 36:50.136
Am I king oftheocean, orwhat?

36:50.208 --> 36:52.403
No. Sorry.

36:53.477 --> 36:55.911
How do I save Planet Drool?

36:56.547 --> 37:00.210
The answer is in your dreams.

37:00.318 --> 37:03.845
You mean if I put him to sleep,
he'll dream us out of this mess?

37:03.888 --> 37:07.654
No. At least, not here.

37:07.725 --> 37:13.163
Darkness is falling. Any dream of his
would become a nightmare -

37:13.231 --> 37:16.496
and you don't want those
becoming a reality.

37:16.567 --> 37:20.025
But if you go
to the Land of Milk and Cookies...

37:20.104 --> 37:21.264
Of course!

37:21.339 --> 37:23.899
...that's where the good dreams are.

37:23.975 --> 37:26.535
Where the answers are.

37:26.611 --> 37:28.135
It's perfect. Max.

37:28.212 --> 37:31.579
The Land of Milk and Cookies
is a safe, sweet place.

37:31.649 --> 37:33.947
You'll be able to dream easily there.

37:34.018 --> 37:35.610
Can you take us?

37:35.686 --> 37:39.281
I have no body. I can't move.

37:39.357 --> 37:42.918
You can move your eyes and your mouth.

37:43.628 --> 37:46.392
Why didn't you work back on Earth, Tobor?

37:46.464 --> 37:51.902
Some dreams are so powerful they
become real - like Sharkboy and Lavagirl.

37:51.969 --> 37:56.906
I, on the other hand,
am still only a dream.

37:56.974 --> 37:57.963
Oh...

37:58.075 --> 38:02.068
- What's wrong?
- Train of Thought... I'm losing it.

38:02.113 --> 38:05.139
You were taking us to the Land
of Milk and Cookies, remember?

38:05.216 --> 38:09.949
I mean I'm literally losing
the Train of Thought. It's down there.

38:10.021 --> 38:13.752
(Max) That's the Train of Thought?
How do I keep it on track?

38:13.824 --> 38:18.420
With your mind. The Train of Thought
gets easily distracted.

38:18.496 --> 38:23.695
Stay focused, and it'll speed you directly
to the Land of Milk and Cookies.

38:23.768 --> 38:25.736
The rest is up to you.

38:25.803 --> 38:27.998
Sorry I forgot about you, Tobor.

38:28.072 --> 38:31.098
Are you kidding? You just saved me.

38:31.175 --> 38:33.735
I'm free!

38:36.547 --> 38:38.845
(thunderclap)

38:38.916 --> 38:41.316
Max, get down here!

38:44.155 --> 38:47.318
- What's wrong?
- We can't control it.

38:47.391 --> 38:49.689
All you have to do is keep it on track.

38:49.760 --> 38:53.594
How can you keep it on track
if there is no track?

38:54.298 --> 38:56.129
(whimpers)

38:56.834 --> 38:59.302
Looks like another dream gone bad!

39:00.838 --> 39:02.465
What do we do?

39:02.540 --> 39:05.236
Yell? Scream?

39:05.309 --> 39:08.073
- (train horn)
- (all scream)

39:13.818 --> 39:15.979
Jump. It'll be all right.

39:32.503 --> 39:36.530
What does it mean
when your Train of Thought... wrecks?

39:36.607 --> 39:40.703
Well... It can't be good, buddy.

39:40.778 --> 39:43.747
How much time do we have, Sharkboy?

39:44.915 --> 39:47.281
- 20 minutes.
- (squelch)

39:53.124 --> 39:54.113
Eww!

39:54.191 --> 39:57.456
Stick to rotten fish, please!

39:57.528 --> 40:01.396
Chocolate! I stepped in chocolate!

40:04.702 --> 40:06.863
We're here.

40:11.842 --> 40:14.470
The Land of Milk and Cookies!

40:16.781 --> 40:18.874
Oh, yeah!

40:21.886 --> 40:25.287
The milk is warm.
He'll be out in no time.

40:25.356 --> 40:29.190
Lay down.
Here's a marshmallow pillow.

40:29.260 --> 40:31.820
How about dreaming us
into the Dream Lair?

40:31.896 --> 40:33.887
(deep thuds)

40:34.365 --> 40:36.959
The ground is thumping too much.

40:37.568 --> 40:40.036
My highly trained ears hear it too.

40:40.104 --> 40:42.334
Boom, boom, boom.

40:42.406 --> 40:44.704
- Let me hear it.
- I wouldn't.

40:48.145 --> 40:49.510
Hothead.

40:49.580 --> 40:55.644
When you dreamt up these giant cookies,
who did you expect to be able to eat them?

40:55.719 --> 40:57.550
I really didn't think about it.

40:57.655 --> 40:59.885
'Cause if you dream giant cookies,

40:59.924 --> 41:04.293
something has to be created
to consume giant cookies.

41:11.902 --> 41:13.802
Cookie giants!

41:13.871 --> 41:16.362
(thudding footsteps)

41:36.927 --> 41:38.451
Ohh...

41:45.669 --> 41:47.728
Frosting.

41:51.208 --> 41:54.075
Those giants almost look like my parents.

41:54.144 --> 41:56.942
They seem happy together.
Is that your dream?

41:57.014 --> 42:01.144
We had a dream we're family.
It hasn't been coming true lately.

42:01.252 --> 42:06.019
Most dreams don't come true on their own.
You have to make them true.

42:06.056 --> 42:09.082
It takes a lot of work. Not easy.

42:09.994 --> 42:12.462
But not impossible either.

42:13.898 --> 42:16.162
Stinking fresh air!

42:16.667 --> 42:19.329
Blinding sunlight!

42:19.403 --> 42:24.864
Oh, how I long for a sky
of fluorescent lights!

42:24.942 --> 42:27.137
(sneeze builds)

42:30.581 --> 42:31.479
(relieved sigh)

42:33.851 --> 42:35.682
(gasps)

42:36.854 --> 42:38.185
Ahh...

42:39.490 --> 42:41.890
- Better stand back.
- (farts)

42:41.959 --> 42:44.223
(plughound whimpers)

42:44.295 --> 42:46.388
All right, thatwas me.

42:47.598 --> 42:51.694
- Still empty-handed, I see.
- If you're so powerful, you find him.

42:51.769 --> 42:55.865
That's your job!
Do it, or I'll have you discharged!

42:55.940 --> 42:57.567
Shh...

42:58.409 --> 43:00.741
Someone is dreaming in here.

43:03.247 --> 43:07.741
All right, Max, you've had
your cookies and milk. Now go to sleep.

43:07.818 --> 43:10.184
I'll try.

43:10.254 --> 43:12.085
Go to sleep!

43:12.156 --> 43:15.250
Not like that. Sing him a lullaby.

43:16.226 --> 43:21.562
# Dream, dream, dream, dream...

43:22.232 --> 43:23.893
Your turn.

43:24.535 --> 43:28.562
# Close your eyes, shut your mouth,
dream a dream and get us out

43:28.639 --> 43:31.972
# Dream, dream, dream,
dream, dream, dream

43:32.042 --> 43:36.035
# Hit the hay, fast asleep,
dream a dream, you little bleep

43:36.113 --> 43:39.480
# Dream, dream, dream,
dream, dream, dream

43:44.488 --> 43:47.252
It's working! Keep it up, Sharkboy.

43:47.324 --> 43:48.951
(hip-hop music)

43:49.026 --> 43:53.258
# Just relax, lay about,
or my fist will put you out

43:53.330 --> 43:56.424
# Dream, dream, dream,
dream, dream, dream

43:56.500 --> 44:00.698
# Take your time, but beware,
there's darkness in the air

44:00.804 --> 44:03.967
# Dream, dream, dream,
dream, dream, dream

44:04.008 --> 44:05.999
Dream about me next, Max.

44:06.076 --> 44:08.670
I need to knowwho I am.

44:08.746 --> 44:12.477
Not just destruction or a simple flame.

44:12.549 --> 44:15.211
Dream of me as something good.

44:19.657 --> 44:23.650
# Don't despair, step right up
Glass of water? Here's a cup

44:23.727 --> 44:26.662
# Dream, dream, dream,
dream, dream, dream

44:26.730 --> 44:29.597
He's having a nightmare!
Wake up, Max! Wake up!

44:29.667 --> 44:33.501
Stop that racket, Sharkboy -
you're giving him nightmares!

44:34.371 --> 44:36.498
Sorry, Max.

44:36.573 --> 44:37.665
Arghl

44:37.741 --> 44:40.005
Ow! Ohh...

44:40.077 --> 44:41.942
What was that for?

44:42.012 --> 44:45.379
Your nightmare was about me, wasn't it?

44:45.449 --> 44:47.713
I don't remember.

44:47.785 --> 44:50.015
But I did dream about one thing...

44:51.188 --> 44:53.213
Plughounds!

44:55.626 --> 44:58.527
This may come as a shock to you.

45:01.265 --> 45:03.756
Feel the power!

45:08.038 --> 45:09.665
It's empty!

45:11.775 --> 45:13.106
Fudge.

45:13.877 --> 45:16.345
I forgot to dream of gas.

45:16.413 --> 45:19.007
- Max!
- (plughounds barking)

45:33.230 --> 45:35.528
My powers are weakening.

45:39.403 --> 45:43.134
Watch the power lines - very dangerous.

45:53.484 --> 45:55.611
Yaaarrhh!

46:12.302 --> 46:14.293
Yaaarrhh!

46:15.305 --> 46:17.432
Sharkboy, get me down from here!

46:17.508 --> 46:20.068
Can't you see I'm busy?

46:29.787 --> 46:31.516
(yells)

46:39.229 --> 46:42.221
Hot lava... Hot lava...

46:42.299 --> 46:44.358
(bubbling)

46:47.504 --> 46:49.972
I don't got much fight left in me, Max.

46:50.040 --> 46:51.974
Where's Lavagirl?

46:53.076 --> 46:55.010
It's up to you now. Max.

46:55.078 --> 46:57.638
Dream us out of here.

46:57.748 --> 47:00.216
We believe in you, Max.

47:02.085 --> 47:06.385
Shark boat with turbo boosters!
Shark boat with turbo boosters!

47:09.660 --> 47:11.719
A banana split?!

47:11.795 --> 47:15.424
Still hungry, Max?
How about a knuckle sandwich?

47:15.499 --> 47:17.592
No, look!

47:17.668 --> 47:20.000
It's a banana-split boat!

47:20.070 --> 47:20.934
(rumbling)

47:21.004 --> 47:23.199
Then let's split!

47:24.208 --> 47:25.607
Ow!

47:25.676 --> 47:26.973
Huh?

47:35.619 --> 47:38.520
(exasperated wail)

47:48.665 --> 47:50.826
Catch you later.

47:51.668 --> 47:56.162
All dreamers mustdream.

47:56.974 --> 48:00.603
This is great, Max.
You're starting to daydream.

48:00.711 --> 48:03.976
Keep that up. and they'll never get us.

48:04.014 --> 48:06.175
Why not?

48:06.250 --> 48:11.153
Learn to dream with your eyes open,
and you won't have to be asleep to dream.

48:11.221 --> 48:15.419
You'll be able to make anything happen
at any time.

48:17.995 --> 48:23.797
# Row, row, row your banana-split boat
gently down the Stream of Consciousness

48:23.867 --> 48:26.267
# Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily

48:26.336 --> 48:28.964
# Life is Max's dream

48:30.774 --> 48:32.901
Sugar will give you nightmares.

48:32.976 --> 48:36.241
- How much time do we have?
- Don't ask.

48:37.014 --> 48:42.475
The Dream Lair's across the Ocean of lce.
We'll have to travel there by foot.

48:42.552 --> 48:45.487
What was it you saw in your dream, Max?

48:46.290 --> 48:50.021
I saw an object shaped like...

48:50.961 --> 48:53.429
Give me something to draw with.

49:05.042 --> 49:07.067
The Crystal Heart!

49:07.144 --> 49:11.774
That's the treasure of the Land of lce!
In the lce Castle.

49:11.848 --> 49:15.648
It can freeze anything - even time.

49:15.719 --> 49:19.120
I've always dreamt
of freezing a moment in time.

49:19.189 --> 49:21.817
And the lce Castle's
ruled by the lce Princess.

49:21.892 --> 49:24.759
I hear she's the most beautiful girl
on the planet.

49:25.128 --> 49:26.152
Ouch!

49:26.229 --> 49:30.063
She is not! She's cold and cruel
and cares for nobody but herself.

49:30.133 --> 49:32.567
She's just saying that, Max.

49:32.636 --> 49:35.799
- Have you met her?
- No. But I know we don't get along.

49:35.872 --> 49:40.104
- How do you know that?
- I'm fire. She's ice.

49:40.177 --> 49:42.236
We must be enemies.

49:42.312 --> 49:44.610
We need that Crystal Heart.

49:44.681 --> 49:47.275
But I need you both to get it.

49:47.818 --> 49:50.252
I just hope this isn't a trap.

49:50.320 --> 49:51.719
Whoa!

49:55.459 --> 49:57.893
If we freeze time with the Crystal Heart,

49:57.961 --> 50:01.692
we'll be able to make it to the Dream Lair
and save the planet.

50:01.765 --> 50:03.756
That's the plan.

50:06.003 --> 50:08.130
Behold the lce Castle!

50:08.205 --> 50:11.003
Home to the Princess of the Land of lce.

50:11.074 --> 50:15.374
- The Crystal Heart's inside the castle?
- So they say.

50:15.445 --> 50:17.572
Let's go.

50:25.489 --> 50:27.548
(sizzling)

50:36.733 --> 50:39.566
It's no use! I'll melt the bridge.

50:39.636 --> 50:42.002
This place inflames me.

50:42.072 --> 50:44.506
Can you cool down enough to get across?

50:44.574 --> 50:46.667
I'd have to be asleep to do that.

50:47.444 --> 50:49.844
Can you try sleepwalking?

50:54.985 --> 51:00.184
My dream is to live on Earth -
but someplace warm -

51:00.290 --> 51:02.417
and that Earth will accept me,

51:02.459 --> 51:06.225
even... if l... destroy...

51:06.930 --> 51:09.262
everything l... touch!

51:09.800 --> 51:12.735
No, Lavagirl! Don't sneeze!

51:21.344 --> 51:22.834
Aaa-tchoo!

51:22.913 --> 51:24.904
Aarghh...

51:29.786 --> 51:30.946
Look.

51:31.021 --> 51:32.989
(small snore)

51:33.056 --> 51:35.081
She's sleeping.

51:50.340 --> 51:52.774
(distant barking)

51:53.677 --> 51:56.737
- They've found us again! Lavagirl!
- Shh!

51:56.813 --> 51:59.475
If you wake her up, she'll reheat.

52:00.484 --> 52:02.315
She can make it.

52:10.927 --> 52:13.361
Lavagirl, they're behind you!

52:16.900 --> 52:18.197
(growls)

52:18.268 --> 52:20.793
(both scream)

52:33.917 --> 52:36.715
- Let's go. Hurry!
- Argh!

52:38.755 --> 52:40.484
It's a trap!

52:41.791 --> 52:47.195
You can almost feel
the electricity in the air, can't you?

52:47.264 --> 52:51.894
This is all wrong.
Someone else's dreams are in here.

52:51.968 --> 52:54.095
Lights out!

53:06.683 --> 53:10.016
Welcome to the Dream Lair!

53:10.086 --> 53:12.987
I am the ruler of Planet Drool.

53:13.056 --> 53:16.492
No, you're not! Max is!

53:16.893 --> 53:20.420
Max may have dreamed it originally...

53:23.033 --> 53:26.730
but I am much... cooler.

53:27.470 --> 53:30.337
I... am Minus.

53:31.708 --> 53:33.903
How'd you get so powerful?

53:33.977 --> 53:36.138
I do a lot of reading.

53:36.213 --> 53:37.942
My book of dreams!

53:38.014 --> 53:42.246
That's why everything's so messed up -
he's changing it!

53:42.319 --> 53:44.685
Electric eels.

53:46.423 --> 53:48.482
(yelps)

53:48.558 --> 53:51.527
Shocking, isn't it, Sharkboy?

53:51.595 --> 53:58.467
Reminds me of the time that electrical
storm blew apart your father's laboratory.

54:00.070 --> 54:02.197
- Where is my father?
- Hm.

54:02.272 --> 54:04.263
Let's see.

54:07.777 --> 54:10.109
Check the bottom of the ocean.

54:13.116 --> 54:15.482
And Lavagirl...

54:15.552 --> 54:18.544
Once I figure out
how to freeze this planet's core,

54:18.622 --> 54:21.182
all of your powers will disappear.

54:21.258 --> 54:24.125
Powers? What powers?

54:26.529 --> 54:30.226
And lastbutleast, Max

54:30.300 --> 54:33.497
You thought you could escape fear
by running away to dreamland.

54:33.570 --> 54:38.473
But fear exists
in the one place you can never escape!

54:39.576 --> 54:41.567
Your mind!

54:42.946 --> 54:45.312
I will show you the true meaning of fear.

54:45.382 --> 54:48.442
When darkness falls,
the rest of your dreams will be destroyed

54:48.518 --> 54:51.214
and I will rule Planet Drool.

54:51.288 --> 54:54.917
Blah-blah-blah, threat-threat-threat...

54:54.991 --> 54:59.519
You must all leave now.
I have some dreaming to do.

54:59.896 --> 55:01.488
Whoa!

55:09.472 --> 55:12.373
If I could just get my dream journal,

55:13.476 --> 55:16.707
I could turn everything
back to the way it was.

55:17.514 --> 55:19.778
My fire's dimming.

55:19.849 --> 55:21.908
(faint sizzling)

55:21.985 --> 55:23.680
I can't melt the bars.

55:23.753 --> 55:26.722
My strength is failing me as well.

55:28.224 --> 55:30.385
How much time do we have, Sharkboy?

55:30.460 --> 55:34.863
Who cares?
We're never getting out of here.

55:34.931 --> 55:36.990
(happy singing)

55:37.067 --> 55:39.126
La La's.

55:39.202 --> 55:42.194
(bubbling and squeaking)

55:45.875 --> 55:47.536
They like you.

55:47.610 --> 55:50.977
- I don't feel distracted right now.
- (Sharkboy) I do!

55:51.047 --> 55:53.242
This song is driving me crazy!

55:53.316 --> 55:56.342
Don't worry about him.
He's a cold fish.

55:56.419 --> 55:58.478
I'm serious!

55:59.289 --> 56:02.281
They're singing at a frequency...

56:02.359 --> 56:04.827
my highly trained ears find...

56:04.894 --> 56:06.555
disturbing!

56:06.629 --> 56:08.995
Sing louder. Sing higher.

56:09.065 --> 56:11.533
(La La's sing louder)

56:12.869 --> 56:15.667
You don't wanna be too close to him
when he explodes.

56:17.273 --> 56:18.331
Aaargghhl

56:18.408 --> 56:20.035
Shark frenzy!

56:32.622 --> 56:35.090
Nice job channeling your anger, Sharkie.

56:37.260 --> 56:38.284
Huh.

56:50.373 --> 56:52.364
(snores)

57:06.089 --> 57:10.150
First things first.
Transportation out of here.

57:13.129 --> 57:15.097
My dreams.

57:19.102 --> 57:21.866
Lavagirl, you have a lava bike!

57:21.938 --> 57:23.428
I do?

57:23.940 --> 57:25.931
I do!

57:27.110 --> 57:28.407
(revs)

57:28.478 --> 57:30.469
This is so exciting!

57:30.547 --> 57:32.139
Cool it, Lavagirl.

57:32.215 --> 57:35.309
Everything we need
is right here in this book.

57:38.054 --> 57:43.583
Sharkboy... your father really is
at the bottom of the ocean.

57:50.900 --> 57:53.334
He's in a submarine.

57:53.970 --> 57:55.995
Looking for you!

57:58.808 --> 58:02.073
He's over the hydrothermal vents,
Mid-Atlantic Ridge,

58:02.145 --> 58:06.582
42 degrees west by 1 4 north.
Depth: 1 800 meters.

58:06.649 --> 58:08.742
Near a snake pit!

58:08.818 --> 58:10.581
I need to get back to Earth.

58:10.653 --> 58:14.350
- What's it say about me?
- I'm not sure what this is.

58:14.424 --> 58:17.552
I can figure it out. Maybe there's
a section on my true identity.

58:17.627 --> 58:19.618
Lavagirl, no!

58:20.630 --> 58:24.031
Oh, no. What have I done?

58:24.100 --> 58:26.364
That's terrific, LG!

58:29.606 --> 58:33.474
It's OK, Lavagirl.
It was an accident.

58:34.344 --> 58:37.575
Why did you make me out of lava?!
Why, Max?

58:39.182 --> 58:43.414
Just let her cool down.
She's just blowing off steam.

58:48.124 --> 58:50.422
I know I can be good.

58:51.127 --> 58:53.254
I can feel it.

58:54.731 --> 58:57.598
But everything I touch, I destroy.

58:58.968 --> 59:04.668
Why did you make me like that?
I have more potential.

59:04.741 --> 59:06.868
I'm sure you do.

59:07.877 --> 59:12.473
And why'd you make us a team?
We're nothing alike.

59:12.549 --> 59:16.542
When I'm near water, I fizzle out.
When he's near heat, he shrivels.

59:16.619 --> 59:18.416
We're not compatible.

59:20.056 --> 59:23.082
Your... hair's on fire.

59:23.159 --> 59:25.593
Yeah, it does that.

59:28.831 --> 59:30.822
Thanks, Sharkie.

59:33.570 --> 59:35.868
Maybe I really am evil.

59:36.573 --> 59:41.203
So far everything else you've dreamed
has been correct.

59:41.277 --> 59:43.939
Maybe I just need to learn to accept it.

59:45.281 --> 59:49.581
That's it! Everything I've dreamt so far
has been correct.

59:49.652 --> 59:51.381
The Crystal Heart!

59:51.454 --> 59:57.051
Yeah, we were captured, but that's
'cause Minus doesn't want me to get it.

59:57.160 --> 59:59.287
(thunderclap)

01:00:00.930 --> 01:00:03.455
We have to get back to the lce Castle.

01:00:03.533 --> 01:00:06.093
1 0 minutes left. We'll never make it!

01:00:06.169 --> 01:00:08.899
- We can do it!
- (both) How?

01:00:09.806 --> 01:00:13.742
You're Sharkboy and Lavagirl.
You can do anything.

01:00:21.250 --> 01:00:23.218
Wake up!

01:00:24.187 --> 01:00:25.654
What?

01:00:25.722 --> 01:00:29.658
He escaped.
And he's getting the Crystal Heart.

01:00:29.726 --> 01:00:31.887
Shut it down. Shut it all down now!

01:00:31.961 --> 01:00:36.421
I did. It's on a grid system.
It takes time for the darkness to travel.

01:00:36.499 --> 01:00:39.093
- How soon?
- Not soon enough.

01:00:39.168 --> 01:00:41.602
- Then destroy him.
- How?

01:00:41.671 --> 01:00:47.371
By smashing his most precious dream:
Sharkboy and Lavagirl.

01:01:07.563 --> 01:01:09.963
Is that what you saw, Max?

01:01:10.033 --> 01:01:11.193
Yes.

01:01:11.267 --> 01:01:14.668
You'll have to climb the ice pillar and get it.

01:01:14.737 --> 01:01:18.571
It's as delicate as a snowflake,
so don't drop it.

01:01:18.641 --> 01:01:22.008
And don't touch it with your hands either -
you'll freeze.

01:01:22.078 --> 01:01:24.103
Use your claws.

01:01:30.420 --> 01:01:32.786
Aaarrhh...

01:01:38.661 --> 01:01:40.822
Lava, can you...?

01:01:41.431 --> 01:01:43.456
Never mind.

01:01:44.167 --> 01:01:47.330
Chew on some ice. It'll keep you cool.

01:01:52.875 --> 01:01:53.864
Hm.

01:02:19.569 --> 01:02:21.662
Great job, Max.

01:02:27.110 --> 01:02:29.010
I got it!

01:02:35.785 --> 01:02:38.253
She's frozen solid!

01:02:56.239 --> 01:02:59.208
Kneel before the lce Princess.

01:03:08.551 --> 01:03:12.112
You tried to steal the Crystal Heart.
Why?

01:03:15.558 --> 01:03:20.291
We believe it can freeze time.
Long enough for us to defeat Minus.

01:03:20.363 --> 01:03:25.096
My Crystal Heart cannot help you.
Only I have the power to use it.

01:03:25.168 --> 01:03:28.228
- Then come with us.
- She can never leave this castle.

01:03:28.304 --> 01:03:33.799
The crystal is the only thing
that protects our kingdom.

01:03:33.876 --> 01:03:36.538
Please, Princess.
We're running out of time.

01:03:36.612 --> 01:03:38.944
Perhaps I could give it to you.

01:03:39.015 --> 01:03:42.781
- Not without my blessing.
- Father, you're smothering me again.

01:03:43.986 --> 01:03:46.352
But are you worthy to wield it?

01:03:46.422 --> 01:03:47.753
Yes.

01:03:47.824 --> 01:03:50.452
The crystal you stole was a decoy.

01:03:50.526 --> 01:03:54.018
The true Crystal Heart
is somewhere in this room.

01:03:54.096 --> 01:03:58.260
Choose the correct one,
and you may carry it before you.

01:03:58.367 --> 01:04:00.062
Pick that one.

01:04:02.205 --> 01:04:04.196
It's around your neck.

01:04:06.742 --> 01:04:10.200
- How'd you know?
- I saw it in my dream.

01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:16.512
Usually, if you snooze, you lose.
With Max, you snooze, you win.

01:04:20.523 --> 01:04:24.983
But be warned, Max,
if anything happens to my Crystal Heart,

01:04:25.061 --> 01:04:28.519
my entire kingdom will be destroyed.

01:04:28.598 --> 01:04:32.728
(king) Do you, Max, take this Crystal Heart
to have and to hold,

01:04:32.802 --> 01:04:36.238
in sickness and in health,
till death do you part?

01:04:36.305 --> 01:04:37.363
I do.

01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:39.840
- Do you trust him with your heart?
- I do.

01:04:39.909 --> 01:04:42.309
Do you mean what you say?

01:04:42.778 --> 01:04:44.177
Yes.

01:04:44.247 --> 01:04:46.147
I mean, I do.

01:04:46.215 --> 01:04:50.174
The crystal will now work -
but my daughter must stay here.

01:04:50.253 --> 01:04:52.312
Off with you, then!

01:04:52.388 --> 01:04:53.855
Good luck.

01:05:01.264 --> 01:05:04.199
We're almost at the Dream Lair!

01:05:04.267 --> 01:05:07.532
If we're gonna do this, we gotta do it now!

01:05:07.603 --> 01:05:11.403
- How much time?
- We're out of time!

01:05:11.474 --> 01:05:13.465
1 0 seconds!

01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:20.710
(muffled yells from Lavagirl)

01:05:20.783 --> 01:05:21.807
What?

01:05:21.884 --> 01:05:23.511
I can't hear you.

01:05:23.586 --> 01:05:25.747
- Five seconds.
- Here it goes.

01:05:25.821 --> 01:05:28.722
Three, two, one...

01:05:28.791 --> 01:05:30.986
(whirring-down noise)

01:05:31.527 --> 01:05:33.392
We're out of time.

01:05:33.462 --> 01:05:35.828
- What happened?
- It didn't work.

01:05:35.898 --> 01:05:38.059
How could it not work?

01:05:40.670 --> 01:05:43.764
I was trying to tell you! Whoa...

01:05:44.573 --> 01:05:46.666
Only the lce Princess can use it.

01:05:46.742 --> 01:05:49.905
It's not her fault
her father won't let her leave her castle.

01:05:49.979 --> 01:05:51.640
Boo-hoo.

01:05:51.714 --> 01:05:53.909
No underwater readings.

01:05:53.983 --> 01:05:55.177
(beeping)

01:05:55.251 --> 01:05:57.242
No anything!

01:06:00.957 --> 01:06:03.482
(evil chuckling)

01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:07.420
I'll rip your sockets to shreds!

01:06:07.496 --> 01:06:11.364
Calm down, Sharkboy.
Mr. Electric's baiting you.

01:06:11.434 --> 01:06:13.698
I can't... fight...

01:06:14.236 --> 01:06:16.261
my instincts!

01:06:16.339 --> 01:06:18.102
No, Sharkboy!

01:06:20.276 --> 01:06:21.766
(snarls)

01:06:21.844 --> 01:06:23.277
Hey!

01:06:24.046 --> 01:06:26.412
Watts... up?

01:06:26.949 --> 01:06:28.883
You know - watts.

01:06:29.385 --> 01:06:31.979
As in a measure of electrical power.

01:06:32.054 --> 01:06:34.522
The 60-watt bulb?

01:06:34.590 --> 01:06:38.185
Watts up?

01:06:38.260 --> 01:06:39.727
What?

01:06:39.795 --> 01:06:44.061
Electric eels. That's what's up.

01:06:44.133 --> 01:06:46.533
Swim away, Sharkboy! Swim away!

01:06:48.070 --> 01:06:50.368
(Mr. Electric cackles)

01:07:07.023 --> 01:07:09.321
Can he survive down there?

01:07:09.392 --> 01:07:12.623
He can hold his breath, but not forever.

01:07:12.695 --> 01:07:16.756
- He'll drown if I don't go get him.
- I can't let you go.

01:07:16.832 --> 01:07:18.857
You'll die too.

01:07:21.270 --> 01:07:23.761
He's my best friend.

01:07:45.995 --> 01:07:48.190
Come on, Sharkboy.

01:07:55.004 --> 01:07:57.404
Come on, Sharkboy!

01:08:04.613 --> 01:08:07.309
Sharkboy! Wake up, Sharkboy!

01:08:12.221 --> 01:08:13.586
Lavagirl!

01:08:14.490 --> 01:08:17.482
Lavagirl! Lavagirl, please!

01:08:18.359 --> 01:08:20.225
Lavagirl...

01:08:26.402 --> 01:08:28.836
What am I gonna do now?

01:08:30.573 --> 01:08:33.337
What do you think you should do?

01:08:35.478 --> 01:08:37.776
Dream a better dream.

01:08:37.846 --> 01:08:40.441
Interesting. Explain.

01:08:41.517 --> 01:08:47.149
I wanted all my dreams to come true,
but I only dreamt for myself.

01:08:47.223 --> 01:08:50.283
I wanted to escape my real world.

01:08:50.359 --> 01:08:54.523
when the world needed my help
to make it a better place.

01:08:55.698 --> 01:08:58.599
Selfish dreams shouldn't come true.

01:08:58.701 --> 01:09:01.727
You're becoming
a very good dreamer, Max.

01:09:01.770 --> 01:09:04.261
A very good dreamer indeed.

01:09:06.509 --> 01:09:11.207
What do you do
when your dreams have been destroyed?

01:09:11.279 --> 01:09:14.147
Dream a better dream.

01:09:14.216 --> 01:09:17.151
An unselfsish dream.

01:09:17.987 --> 01:09:19.648
(gasps)

01:09:24.527 --> 01:09:27.859
She knew this would happen
if she saved you.

01:09:27.930 --> 01:09:30.057
But I couldn't stop her.

01:09:33.969 --> 01:09:35.334
Look!

01:09:37.872 --> 01:09:39.863
Lava.

01:09:41.010 --> 01:09:43.274
We have to get her to that volcano.

01:09:43.345 --> 01:09:46.075
I'll go. I'm stronger and faster.

01:09:46.148 --> 01:09:48.139
You'll burn up.

01:09:51.453 --> 01:09:55.651
- Sure this will save her?
- lt'll do more than save her.

01:10:02.464 --> 01:10:05.558
I know who you are, Lavagirl.

01:10:06.468 --> 01:10:10.165
You are not fire. or a simple flame.

01:10:10.973 --> 01:10:13.567
You are greater than that.

01:10:13.642 --> 01:10:17.908
Something more important.
and so necessary.

01:10:18.881 --> 01:10:21.577
It is why you must live.

01:10:25.221 --> 01:10:27.519
You are not destruction.

01:10:36.632 --> 01:10:38.532
You are not evil.

01:10:48.410 --> 01:10:50.139
Stand back.

01:10:52.514 --> 01:10:55.381
You are... Iight.

01:11:08.831 --> 01:11:12.790
Who turned on the lights?! Oh!

01:11:13.535 --> 01:11:16.265
Power, everywhere!

01:11:31.253 --> 01:11:34.518
Whoa! How'd you get here so fast?

01:11:34.590 --> 01:11:37.923
Hold off Mr. Electric
while I deal with Minus.

01:11:37.993 --> 01:11:40.427
I'll need my fish army.

01:11:40.496 --> 01:11:42.623
I'll unfreeze the ocean.

01:11:44.633 --> 01:11:46.498
Good luck.

01:11:49.705 --> 01:11:52.071
I've become what you feared most...

01:11:52.141 --> 01:11:54.006
Minus.

01:11:55.044 --> 01:11:56.807
How did you get in here?

01:11:56.879 --> 01:12:02.818
I'm the Daydreamer,
able to dream with my eyes open.

01:12:02.918 --> 01:12:06.786
Hate to burst your bubble, Dream Boy,
but I read your book.

01:12:06.822 --> 01:12:10.815
There's not one dream you've got
that I haven't already seen.

01:12:10.893 --> 01:12:15.921
So what do you say?
Let's blow the roof off this place.

01:12:15.998 --> 01:12:17.522
(yells)

01:12:20.302 --> 01:12:22.862
May the best dream win!

01:12:47.196 --> 01:12:48.185
Wait!

01:12:48.263 --> 01:12:49.491
(exasperated grunt)

01:12:53.635 --> 01:12:55.500
Brainstorm!

01:13:08.984 --> 01:13:10.576
Eugh!

01:13:11.286 --> 01:13:13.754
Brain...freeze!

01:13:17.092 --> 01:13:18.889
Brain...

01:13:20.095 --> 01:13:21.357
fart!

01:13:21.797 --> 01:13:23.788
(hiss of gas)

01:13:25.234 --> 01:13:26.223
Oh...

01:13:34.977 --> 01:13:37.207
(growls)

01:13:41.950 --> 01:13:44.748
Get ready for the ultimate power outage.

01:13:44.820 --> 01:13:46.515
(chuckles)

01:13:46.588 --> 01:13:51.992
And who are you to believe
that you can defeat me now?

01:13:52.060 --> 01:13:54.153
No one special.

01:13:54.229 --> 01:13:58.063
Just... king of the ocean.

01:13:58.167 --> 01:13:59.930
(gasps)

01:14:05.974 --> 01:14:07.407
Ooh...

01:14:11.747 --> 01:14:13.874
Shark frenzy.

01:14:13.949 --> 01:14:17.350
Aaarhh... Aaarhh... Aaarhh...

01:14:17.419 --> 01:14:18.784
A-ha!

01:14:19.354 --> 01:14:22.414
You're afraid of me, aren't you?

01:14:26.395 --> 01:14:28.329
I used to be.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.298
Someone smashed your dreams once -

01:14:34.369 --> 01:14:37.634
now all you can do
is smash everyone else's.

01:14:45.547 --> 01:14:49.847
We can create a better dream than this.
A better world.

01:14:49.918 --> 01:14:51.977
Don't you see?

01:14:57.960 --> 01:15:00.019
What do you say...

01:15:01.096 --> 01:15:03.087
Linus?

01:15:13.008 --> 01:15:14.703
(creaking)

01:15:14.776 --> 01:15:16.835
Hurry!

01:15:17.346 --> 01:15:19.576
No!

01:15:23.218 --> 01:15:26.654
Don't let me fall!

01:15:28.690 --> 01:15:31.056
Wouldn't dream of it.

01:15:39.368 --> 01:15:44.032
Don't smash people's dreams, Linus,
because you'll smash your own as well.

01:15:44.573 --> 01:15:46.939
And you too will stop believing.

01:15:47.009 --> 01:15:49.842
(whooshing/tinkling)

01:15:51.213 --> 01:15:53.408
Max!

01:15:53.482 --> 01:15:55.347
I am light.

01:15:55.417 --> 01:15:56.509
Thank you.

01:15:56.585 --> 01:16:00.715
You were always that.
It had nothing to do with me.

01:16:00.822 --> 01:16:04.019
But now I know. So thank you.

01:16:04.059 --> 01:16:08.553
OK, so she's a light. Big deal.

01:16:08.630 --> 01:16:12.896
The real news is... what I am.

01:16:12.968 --> 01:16:14.959
Annoying?

01:16:15.771 --> 01:16:18.239
King of the ocean.

01:16:18.307 --> 01:16:20.400
Thanks for saving me.

01:16:21.410 --> 01:16:23.310
(sizzling)

01:16:24.513 --> 01:16:26.447
Ouch.

01:16:26.515 --> 01:16:29.382
Everything will return
to being the way it was.

01:16:29.451 --> 01:16:32.614
You will be able to travel to Earth
and back again as you wish.

01:16:32.688 --> 01:16:36.124
You can search for your father.
You can rule Earth's lava world.

01:16:36.191 --> 01:16:41.128
And what am I to do,
now that you're all buddy-buddy?

01:16:41.863 --> 01:16:47.062
Mr. Electric can go back
to being the good electrician of the planet.

01:16:47.135 --> 01:16:48.568
Oh, really?

01:16:48.637 --> 01:16:50.969
Plugging in power cords?

01:16:51.039 --> 01:16:54.338
Keeping this loud, obnoxious world
a happy place?

01:16:54.409 --> 01:16:55.899
You're dreaming!

01:16:55.978 --> 01:16:58.913
I dreamt you up,
and I can undream you.

01:16:59.014 --> 01:17:04.782
You think you can just snap your eyes
open and make me vanish? Not so easy.

01:17:04.820 --> 01:17:07.755
I am the danger of dreaming.

01:17:07.823 --> 01:17:10.690
For every person
who dreams up the electric light bulb,

01:17:10.759 --> 01:17:14.195
there's the one
who dreams up the atom bomb.

01:17:14.262 --> 01:17:16.696
This is one dream
you won't be waking up from.

01:17:16.765 --> 01:17:21.429
I'm gonna put an end
to this ridiculous tangent at its source!

01:17:23.238 --> 01:17:25.365
Where did he go?

01:17:26.608 --> 01:17:28.269
He's headed to Earth.

01:17:28.343 --> 01:17:32.109
He's going to try and destroy you
in your sleep.

01:17:33.048 --> 01:17:35.073
In my sleep?

01:17:36.685 --> 01:17:41.850
You mean I'm asleep?
All this time I've been asleep?

01:17:41.923 --> 01:17:44.858
No. You're dreaming, Max.

01:17:44.926 --> 01:17:47.019
With your eyes open.

01:17:47.095 --> 01:17:48.926
Make the dream real.

01:17:48.997 --> 01:17:53.730
You can live out your dreams on Earth.
Just like you made us real.

01:17:53.802 --> 01:17:55.326
Make it real.

01:17:55.404 --> 01:17:58.339
Blink your eyes three times.

01:17:58.440 --> 01:18:00.408
One...

01:18:00.442 --> 01:18:02.876
Wait. What happens when...?

01:18:02.944 --> 01:18:04.172
Two...

01:18:06.515 --> 01:18:08.574
Will I ever see you again?

01:18:08.650 --> 01:18:10.208
Three.

01:18:14.690 --> 01:18:16.715
(whooshing)

01:18:18.060 --> 01:18:22.394
Everyone follow me, I said!
We've got to find shelter!

01:18:23.131 --> 01:18:27.534
Max, get up!
There's a tornado heading our way!

01:18:29.304 --> 01:18:35.072
It's not a tornado.
It's much worse than that.

01:18:35.143 --> 01:18:37.270
Linus, wake up!

01:18:37.345 --> 01:18:39.210
Look!

01:18:47.322 --> 01:18:49.586
Charge!

01:18:49.658 --> 01:18:54.994
It's Mr. Electric from Planet Drool!
The one from my dreams!

01:18:55.063 --> 01:18:59.397
You mean... this is real?
Your dream is real?

01:18:59.501 --> 01:19:03.096
Some dreams are so powerful
they become real.

01:19:03.138 --> 01:19:04.935
I don't believe it.

01:19:05.006 --> 01:19:07.736
- It's right there in front of you!
- I can see that!

01:19:07.809 --> 01:19:14.305
What I can't believe is you dreamt me
as a big round bad guy! I'm not bad!

01:19:14.783 --> 01:19:18.275
Sorry. Kinda took on a life of its own.

01:19:18.353 --> 01:19:20.344
(manic laugh)

01:19:22.991 --> 01:19:27.951
- Max is in Building C.
- No, he's not. He's in Building W.

01:19:28.029 --> 01:19:30.589
That was the other school!

01:19:42.944 --> 01:19:44.844
Aaarhhl

01:19:44.913 --> 01:19:46.346
Help!

01:19:48.984 --> 01:19:51.578
Find Max! Tell him I love him!

01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:55.647
- Don't leave me!
- I thought you wanted me to leave.

01:19:56.124 --> 01:19:59.685
No, I don't. You're my best friend.

01:20:00.195 --> 01:20:02.026
I love you.

01:20:03.064 --> 01:20:04.691
I love you too.

01:20:04.766 --> 01:20:07.291
Aaarghl

01:20:09.638 --> 01:20:11.765
Come back!

01:20:13.208 --> 01:20:15.699
Please, come back.

01:20:24.920 --> 01:20:27.946
I'm not going anywhere.

01:20:28.990 --> 01:20:31.083
Neither am l.

01:20:31.159 --> 01:20:33.184
Aah...Aarghl

01:20:35.597 --> 01:20:37.030
Uh-oh.

01:20:37.098 --> 01:20:39.532
Aaargghhl

01:20:50.345 --> 01:20:55.510
OK, class. I'm just a teacher, and
I'm here to inspire the answers from you.

01:20:55.584 --> 01:20:58.553
And I think that's some
pretty good inspiration outside.

01:20:58.653 --> 01:21:03.920
So this is now a pop quiz.
We need to defeat that guy. Any ideas?

01:21:04.860 --> 01:21:08.421
Wow, Linus. You get a plus
for being the first hand in the air.

01:21:08.496 --> 01:21:10.657
I can take him.

01:21:10.732 --> 01:21:12.427
Linus, watch out!

01:21:15.237 --> 01:21:17.205
- Poop.
- Aaargh!

01:21:17.272 --> 01:21:19.001
Ohh...

01:21:23.745 --> 01:21:25.110
(girl) Nice try.

01:21:25.180 --> 01:21:27.944
Sorry, Max. Your journal.

01:21:28.016 --> 01:21:30.610
It's OK. It was an accident.

01:21:30.685 --> 01:21:33.176
Plenty more dreams
where those came from.

01:21:35.023 --> 01:21:38.390
OK, kids, who's next?
Remember, there are no dumb ideas.

01:21:38.460 --> 01:21:42.021
- Maybe we can freeze his circuits.
- That's the dumbest idea I ever heard.

01:21:42.097 --> 01:21:45.555
We're in the middle of Texas in August!
Next idea? Anyone but Linus.

01:21:45.634 --> 01:21:49.070
Wait - that's a great idea!
Thanks, Linus.

01:21:49.137 --> 01:21:51.401
Come here, Marissa.

01:21:56.278 --> 01:21:58.212
Is this yours?

01:21:58.313 --> 01:22:00.178
How'd you find it?

01:22:00.215 --> 01:22:02.479
So you've seen this?

01:22:03.084 --> 01:22:07.077
Yes, but... only in a dream.

01:22:07.155 --> 01:22:10.818
- It can freeze anything.
- Even time.

01:22:10.892 --> 01:22:14.225
What are you doing?
You're not sending my daughter out there.

01:22:14.296 --> 01:22:15.627
Let her out.

01:22:16.264 --> 01:22:19.358
Electrical storm headed your way!

01:22:19.968 --> 01:22:23.131
- Do you know what to do?
- I believe so.

01:22:23.805 --> 01:22:25.898
Stand back.

01:22:32.948 --> 01:22:35.678
Oh, who do we have here?

01:22:38.787 --> 01:22:42.245
Get ready for the mega-hurts!

01:22:43.825 --> 01:22:46.760
Get it? Hertz?

01:22:46.828 --> 01:22:49.661
As in the unit of electrical frequency?

01:22:53.535 --> 01:22:56.698
You're just not paying attention in class,
are you?

01:22:56.771 --> 01:22:58.033
Ooh!

01:23:06.047 --> 01:23:08.845
Whoa! Awesome!

01:23:08.917 --> 01:23:11.147
He's unplugged.

01:23:11.219 --> 01:23:13.449
(all) Yeah!

01:23:27.936 --> 01:23:32.134
- You made me a great teacher today.
- How did I do that?

01:23:32.207 --> 01:23:36.007
A great teacher learns as much
from his students as they do from him.

01:23:36.077 --> 01:23:40.036
You have... awakened me.

01:23:40.849 --> 01:23:42.680
Thank you, Max.

01:24:10.311 --> 01:24:12.176
Max.

01:24:12.247 --> 01:24:14.545
Your report, please.

01:24:23.691 --> 01:24:26.683
The following story is true.

01:24:27.295 --> 01:24:29.695
It might have started as a dream,

01:24:29.764 --> 01:24:34.292
but, as we saw yesterday,
when we make our dreams a reality...

01:24:34.836 --> 01:24:38.033
reality becomes a dream.

01:24:38.873 --> 01:24:41.933
Sharkboy lives his dream
as king of the ocean.

01:24:42.010 --> 01:24:44.979
where he cares for all its creatures.

01:24:45.046 --> 01:24:49.312
He searches for his father's submarine
where there is no light -

01:24:49.384 --> 01:24:54.981
except in one place. where light shines
almost as bright as the sun.

01:24:55.056 --> 01:24:57.581
It's where Lavagirl lives her dream.

01:24:57.692 --> 01:25:02.186
as queen of Earth's volcanoes
that boil at the bottom of the sea.

01:25:02.230 --> 01:25:04.960
a force of life for all living things.

01:25:06.434 --> 01:25:09.267
Sharkboy and Lavagirl
don't visit me anymore.
