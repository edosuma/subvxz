27:43.896 --> 27:46.265
YOU'LL GO
INTO OXYGEN DEBT,

27:46.298 --> 27:49.268
POSSIBLY INTO
OXYGEN BANKRUPTCY,
BUT DON'T WORRY.

27:49.301 --> 27:53.272
I JUST WANT TO GO
ONE SECOND LONGER
THAN MARCUS.

27:53.305 --> 27:56.275
WELL, MARCUS HOLDS
THE INSTITUTE RECORD

27:56.308 --> 28:00.112
WITH 25 MINUTES...
AND 14 SECONDS.

28:00.146 --> 28:01.347
READY?

28:01.380 --> 28:04.450
THERE'S YOUR CLOCK.
HAVE A GOOD TRIP.

28:19.832 --> 28:22.301
THIS IS THE TORTURE TEST?

28:27.974 --> 28:31.043
[WHISTLING]

28:57.336 --> 29:00.807
[BEEPING FASTER]

29:25.464 --> 29:27.867
HE'S GOING FOR 25:14.

29:33.906 --> 29:35.808
COME ON, DAVID!

30:01.333 --> 30:02.935
COME ON, DAVID!

30:02.969 --> 30:04.470
KEEP IT UP, DAVE!

30:07.339 --> 30:10.342
COME ON, DAVID!
COME ON!

30:18.885 --> 30:19.952
PUSH HARDER!

30:37.636 --> 30:39.538
COME ON, DAVID!

30:43.609 --> 30:45.011
KEEP IT UP!

30:52.051 --> 30:53.052
PUSH, DAVID!

31:00.192 --> 31:03.329
COME ON, DAVID!
KEEP IT UP!

31:03.362 --> 31:05.331
AAH!

31:05.364 --> 31:07.366
GO, GO!

31:08.367 --> 31:10.336
SHUT IT OFF.

31:10.369 --> 31:12.972
EASY. EASY.

31:48.407 --> 31:51.410
IT'S LIKE STAR WARS
DOWN HERE.

31:53.012 --> 31:54.947
WARP SPEED.

32:58.544 --> 33:00.012
MARCUS?

33:20.766 --> 33:25.071
I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU STILL
PLAN TO GO TO COLORADO.

33:25.104 --> 33:28.674
DAVID ALWAYS WANTED
TO SEE THE WEST.

33:28.707 --> 33:30.676
YOU'VE GOT
TO TELL HIM.

33:30.709 --> 33:32.378
I CAN'T, DENNIS.

33:33.812 --> 33:35.181
NOT NOW.

33:35.214 --> 33:36.582
NOT AFTER TODAY.

33:36.615 --> 33:39.518
I DON'T WANT TO
RUIN IT FOR HIM.

33:39.551 --> 33:42.554
I LOVE HIM
TOO MUCH FOR THAT.

33:42.588 --> 33:46.092
I UNDERSTAND.
WELL, I GOT TO RUN.

33:46.125 --> 33:47.493
WAIT UP, DENNIS.

33:47.526 --> 33:50.096
I'LL WALK OUT
WITH YOU.

34:02.808 --> 34:04.543
O.K.

34:08.347 --> 34:09.715
O.K.

34:13.752 --> 34:16.121
NO BIG DEAL.

34:36.308 --> 34:37.443
HI.

34:37.476 --> 34:38.543
HI.

34:38.577 --> 34:40.579
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
OUT HERE?

34:40.612 --> 34:43.114
JUST NEEDED
SOME FRESH AIR.

34:43.149 --> 34:47.119
YOU WANT TO HEAR
THE RESULTS OF
YOUR CAT SCAN?

34:47.152 --> 34:48.554
I KNOW THE RESULTS.

34:48.587 --> 34:50.356
YOU DO?
WHO TOLD YOU?

34:50.389 --> 34:52.491
NO ONE
HAS TO TELL ME.

34:54.460 --> 34:56.228
I'M FINE, RIGHT?

34:56.262 --> 34:58.297
PHYSICALLY, YOU'RE FINE.

34:58.330 --> 35:01.400
YOU HAVE KING KONG'S
CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM.

35:01.433 --> 35:03.835
IT'S JUST EMOTIONALLY,
YOU'RE A MESS.

35:03.869 --> 35:07.706
ANYBODY WHO COULD WASTE
YOUR POTENTIAL
PISSES ME OFF.

35:07.739 --> 35:09.575
IT PISSES ME OFF,
TOO.

35:09.608 --> 35:11.543
WHAT ARE YOU GOING
TO DO ABOUT IT?

35:11.577 --> 35:13.645
I DON'T KNOW.

35:15.514 --> 35:19.185
SHINTO PHILOSOPHY
TEACHES YOU
TO ACCEPT LIFE

35:19.218 --> 35:20.752
AS A SEASONAL
OCCUPATION.

35:20.786 --> 35:23.289
SOUNDS LIKE BULL-SHINTO
TO ME.

35:24.523 --> 35:27.493
I REALLY PRUNED YOUR ASS
ON THAT TREADMILL.

35:27.526 --> 35:29.895
YOU ALSO BEAT
MY S.A.T. SCORES.

35:29.928 --> 35:34.500
SO YOU'RE GREAT
AT TAKING TESTS.
I MEAN, B.F.D.

35:34.533 --> 35:38.204
LOOK, HERE'S THE THING...

35:38.237 --> 35:39.871
SHINTO.

35:39.905 --> 35:42.708
THERE'S THIS
BIKE RACE IN COLORADO.

35:42.741 --> 35:45.344
THE HELL OF THE WEST.

35:45.377 --> 35:48.280
RIGHT. IT'S MY LAST RACE,
AND I'D LIKE--

35:48.314 --> 35:49.681
I WOULD LOVE TO.

35:49.715 --> 35:50.682
WHAT?

35:50.716 --> 35:52.418
RACE.

35:52.451 --> 35:54.753
I HAD A SPEECH PREPARED

35:54.786 --> 35:57.756
ABOUT HOW WE'D
NEVER RACED TOGETHER

35:57.789 --> 36:01.360
AND THIS MIGHT BE
OUR LAST CHANCE.

36:01.393 --> 36:03.329
MARCUS...
JUST ONE THING.

36:03.362 --> 36:04.496
WHAT?

36:04.530 --> 36:07.399
I'M NOT
SHAVING MY LEGS.

36:09.768 --> 36:11.737
WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT.

36:13.772 --> 36:17.343
I THINK MAYBE
WE SHOULD CALL MOM.

36:17.376 --> 36:19.345
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

36:19.378 --> 36:20.346
O.K.

36:20.379 --> 36:21.780
O.K.

36:26.385 --> 36:28.920
MARCUS, HOW IS HE?

36:28.954 --> 36:32.491
HE'S JUST FINE.
CLEAN AS A WHISTLE.

36:32.524 --> 36:33.892
OH, GOD.

36:36.428 --> 36:38.464
OH, DARLING!

36:38.497 --> 36:41.800
ENOUGH ALREADY.
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE CELEBRATING.

36:41.833 --> 36:43.769
DARLING,
I AM CELEBRATING!

36:43.802 --> 36:46.772
I'VE LIVED
WITH THIS SO LONG.

36:46.805 --> 36:48.807
DAVEY'S ALL I'VE GOT.

36:48.840 --> 36:51.810
I THOUGHT
YOU HAD TWO SONS.

36:51.843 --> 36:54.280
MARCUS, OF COURSE I DO.

36:54.313 --> 36:58.384
THAT'S NOT WHAT
I WAS GOING TO SAY.

36:58.417 --> 37:00.552
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
THIS WHOLE
CONVERSATION

37:00.586 --> 37:03.555
IS PROBABLY NOT
WHAT I MEANT TO SAY.

37:03.589 --> 37:05.624
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

37:05.657 --> 37:07.293
IT MEANS--

37:07.326 --> 37:08.627
DAVEY'S ALL RIGHT,
ISN'T HE?

37:08.660 --> 37:11.897
DAVID'S JUST FINE.
HE SENDS HIS LOVE.

37:11.930 --> 37:13.599
I GOT TO GO, MOM.

37:13.632 --> 37:16.868
MARCUS,
PLEASE UNDERSTAND
THAT I LOVE--

37:16.902 --> 37:19.871
I GOT TO GO. BYE.

37:25.043 --> 37:26.345
HOW'S MOM?

37:26.378 --> 37:27.346
SHE'S FINE.

37:27.379 --> 37:29.748
YOU TOLD HER
I WAS O.K.?

37:29.781 --> 37:33.352
NO, I TOLD HER
YOU GOT HIT BY A BUS.

37:33.385 --> 37:34.753
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

37:34.786 --> 37:37.456
I WANT TO SHOW YOU
GUYS SOMETHING.

37:41.793 --> 37:43.362
REMEMBER THIS?

37:43.395 --> 37:47.433
THIS IS THE FIRST
OF THREE STAGES
IN THIS RACE.

37:47.466 --> 37:50.569
IF YOU DON'T FINISH
IN THE TOP HALF,

37:50.602 --> 37:52.771
WELL, YOU'RE OUT.

38:01.447 --> 38:02.614
PRETTY FAST, HUH?

38:02.648 --> 38:03.682
YEAH.

38:03.715 --> 38:05.083
IT GETS FASTER.

38:05.116 --> 38:08.787
SOME OF THESE GUYS
HIT 60 MILES AN HOUR.

38:08.820 --> 38:12.424
IT CAN GET
REAL DANGEROUS.

38:12.458 --> 38:16.495
THERE'S ME AND MUZZIN
GOING AT IT.

38:16.528 --> 38:18.063
YEAH, THAT'S--

38:18.096 --> 38:20.098
THAT'S THE GUY
IN THE POSTER
IN THE KITCHEN.

38:20.131 --> 38:22.534
UH-HUH.
THAT'S BARRY MUZZIN.

38:22.568 --> 38:25.070
HE WAS MY TEAMMATE
AND MY BEST FRIEND.

38:27.973 --> 38:30.909
HE'S AFFECTIONATELY
KNOWN AS THE CANNIBAL.

38:30.942 --> 38:32.544
YOU KNOW HIM?

38:32.578 --> 38:35.381
YES.
I WAS MARRIED TO HIM.

38:35.414 --> 38:36.548
SEE THAT?

38:36.582 --> 38:38.350
SEE WHAT?

38:47.559 --> 38:48.794
RIGHT THERE.

38:51.997 --> 38:54.633
YOU SEE THAT?
RACE IS OVER.

38:54.666 --> 38:56.402
I QUIT.

38:56.435 --> 38:58.069
NO, YOU DIDN'T.

38:58.103 --> 39:01.573
I'M GOOD AT IT.
NOBODY CAN TELL.

39:05.577 --> 39:08.880
THAT'S HOW IT LOOKS
WHEN YOU WIN.

39:11.983 --> 39:14.686
THIS IS WHAT
IT SOUNDS LIKE.

39:14.720 --> 39:15.987
[CHEERING]

39:46.985 --> 39:49.555
* THE MOON IS ON
THE HIGHWAY *

39:49.588 --> 39:51.557
* DARKNESS FILLS THE SKY

39:51.590 --> 39:53.859

40:37.669 --> 40:38.837
GOOD SHOT.

40:46.878 --> 40:48.980
HA HA HA HA!

40:50.782 --> 40:53.719
* THE MOON IS ON
THE HIGHWAY *

40:53.752 --> 40:55.621
* DARKNESS FILLS THE SKY

41:08.233 --> 41:10.902
[LAUGHING]

41:14.973 --> 41:17.776
I'M STARVED.
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?

41:17.809 --> 41:20.178
GIVE HER THIS.
THEY'RE GREAT.

41:20.211 --> 41:21.780
HERE, BECK.

41:21.813 --> 41:25.183
I'M TIRED OF GRANOLA
AND SESAME SEEDS.

41:25.216 --> 41:27.786
THEY'RE PURE PROTEIN
AND ENERGY.

41:27.819 --> 41:29.788
I NEED A SHAKE,
FRENCH FRIES,

41:29.821 --> 41:32.023
AND A QUARTER-POUNDER
WITH CHEESE.

41:32.057 --> 41:35.794
HAVE YOU EVER LOOKED
IN A COW'S EYES
WHEN IT'S BEING KILLED?

41:35.827 --> 41:38.797
YOU'RE EATING FEAR.
YOU'RE BECOMING ONE
WITH FEAR.

41:38.830 --> 41:42.100
WE WERE GOING TO
LIVE OFF THE LAND.

41:42.133 --> 41:46.805
EATING GENERIC NUTS
FROM THE SUPERMARKET
ISN'T LIVING OFF THE LAND.

41:46.838 --> 41:48.807
WE MADE A VOW.

41:48.840 --> 41:52.911
LOOK INTO
THE CRYSTAL LIGHT
AND RELEASE MEAT.

41:52.944 --> 41:55.814
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

41:55.847 --> 41:59.585
HEY, WHAT THE HELL'S THAT?

41:59.618 --> 42:02.253
THE PONY EXPRESS?

42:02.287 --> 42:04.155
* DARKNESS FILLS THE SKY

42:04.189 --> 42:07.192
* LONG AS
I KEEP DRIVING *

42:07.225 --> 42:08.660
* I KNOW THAT
I WON'T DIE... **

42:08.694 --> 42:10.762
HOW ABOUT A LIFT?

42:18.136 --> 42:19.871
I WAS WONDERING.

42:19.905 --> 42:22.273
IF DAD WERE
ALIVE TODAY...

42:22.307 --> 42:23.274
YEAH?

42:23.308 --> 42:26.778
THEY DIDN'T
HAVE A CURE

42:26.812 --> 42:29.881
FOR BERRY ANEURYSM
TWO YEARS AGO.

42:29.915 --> 42:31.883
THEY STILL DON'T,
DAVID.

42:31.917 --> 42:36.888
IF THERE'S A WEAK
BLOOD VESSEL DEEP
INSIDE THE BRAIN,

42:36.922 --> 42:40.892
IT CAN'T BE REACHED
WITHOUT DESTROYING
VITAL BRAIN FUNCTIONS.

42:40.926 --> 42:43.028
MEANING THE PATIENT COULD
BECOME A CHEF SALAD.

42:43.061 --> 42:47.132
IT'S LIKE
A HEART ATTACK
OF THE HEAD.

42:47.165 --> 42:50.869
IT CAN HIT YOU
RIGHT OUT OF THE BLUE.

42:50.902 --> 42:53.905
WELL, THE THING IS,
YOU KNOW...

42:53.939 --> 42:55.907
YOU READ THOSE STORIES.

42:55.941 --> 42:58.910
SOME BALD GUY
GROWS HAIR AGAIN.

42:58.944 --> 43:02.247
NOW HE NEEDS
A WEEKLY HAIRCUT.

43:02.280 --> 43:04.883
DOING THINGS
THROUGH WILL POWER.

43:04.916 --> 43:07.318
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THAT STUFF?

43:10.221 --> 43:11.923
YEAH.

43:15.927 --> 43:16.928
WELL...

43:18.930 --> 43:20.365
GOOD NIGHT.

43:20.398 --> 43:21.667
GOOD NIGHT.

43:21.700 --> 43:22.834
GOOD NIGHT, DAVID.

43:29.440 --> 43:36.247
AWOO!

43:41.820 --> 43:44.823
I ALWAYS WANTED TO DO THAT.

43:47.458 --> 43:49.861
GOOD NIGHT.

44:04.142 --> 44:05.844
HEY.

44:05.877 --> 44:08.847
HEY! DON'T FORGET
THE NAPKINS.

44:10.348 --> 44:12.851
CAN I TAKE
YOUR ORDER?

44:12.884 --> 44:17.856
I'D LIKE A QUARTER-POUNDER,
FRIES, AND A CHOCOLATE SHAKE.

44:17.889 --> 44:20.692
IT'LL BE A MINUTE FOR
YOUR QUARTER-POUNDER.

44:20.726 --> 44:23.261
WOULD YOU LIKE
A BIG MAC INSTEAD?

44:23.294 --> 44:25.864
O.K. UH, WAIT. NO.

44:25.897 --> 44:27.332
I'LL WAIT.

44:50.321 --> 44:52.457
WHERE ARE YOU HEADED?

44:52.490 --> 44:55.193
CALIFORNIA, MAYBE.

44:55.226 --> 44:56.294
OH.

44:56.327 --> 44:57.295
YOU?

44:57.328 --> 44:58.296
COLORADO.

44:58.329 --> 44:59.297
MMM.

44:59.330 --> 45:01.299
WHERE ARE
YOUR FRIENDS?

45:01.332 --> 45:05.336
IT DIDN'T WORK OUT.
I SPLIT.

45:08.373 --> 45:10.241
IT ISN'T RIGHT,
MARCUS.

45:10.275 --> 45:11.276
WHAT?

45:11.309 --> 45:14.279
YOU SHOULD
TELL HIM THE TRUTH.

45:14.312 --> 45:17.282
WE WOULDN'T BE MAKING
THIS TRIP IF HE KNEW.

45:17.315 --> 45:19.084
I THINK YOU
UNDERESTIMATE HIM.

45:19.117 --> 45:21.920
DO YOU MIND?
HE'S MY BROTHER.

45:24.322 --> 45:27.458
MAYBE I KNOW SOME THINGS
ABOUT HIM THAT YOU DON'T.

45:27.492 --> 45:30.428
MAYBE SO,
BUT DON'T USE
THAT TONE WITH ME.

45:34.232 --> 45:36.902
YOU NEVER HEARD
OF BIKE RACING?

45:36.935 --> 45:39.304
NO. IS THAT WHAT
YOU WERE DOING TODAY?

45:39.337 --> 45:42.808
NO. WE WERE TRAINING
FOR THIS BIG RACE
IN COLORADO.

45:42.841 --> 45:44.309
IT'S VERY DANGEROUS.

45:44.342 --> 45:48.413
ONE WRONG MOVE,
AND YOU'RE JUST
ANOTHER STATISTIC.

45:48.446 --> 45:51.182
I HOPE YOU COME
OUT OF IT ALIVE.

45:53.518 --> 45:55.353
GOOD LUCK.

45:55.386 --> 45:57.022
YOU, TOO.

45:57.055 --> 45:58.523
BYE.

45:59.958 --> 46:02.393
BYE.

46:02.427 --> 46:04.395
WOULD YOU
LIKE A RIDE?

46:07.899 --> 46:10.201
WHERE,
ON YOUR HANDLEBARS?

46:10.235 --> 46:12.303
[BECKY]
SOUNDS INCREDIBLE.

46:12.337 --> 46:13.304
MARCUS.

46:13.338 --> 46:14.840
LOOK.

46:14.873 --> 46:17.042
[BECKY]
HOW FAST CAN YOU GO
ON THOSE BIKES?

46:17.075 --> 46:18.944

WE MADE IT!

01:05:35.199 --> 01:05:37.034
AAH!

01:05:40.204 --> 01:05:43.573
14, 15, 16 RIDERS

01:05:43.607 --> 01:05:46.176
THE WINNERS ARE ALREADY IN.

01:05:46.210 --> 01:05:49.513
WE'RE COUNTING

I DON'T KNOW.

01:05:57.454 --> 01:05:59.689
43, 44, 45.

01:05:59.723 --> 01:06:04.361
ONLY THREE MORE RIDERS
WILL STAY IN THE RACE.

01:06:04.394 --> 01:06:08.365
THE REST WILL HAVE TO WAIT

01:06:11.468 --> 01:06:13.603
DAVID!

01:06:17.141 --> 01:06:19.176
COME ON, DAVID!

01:06:19.209 --> 01:06:20.344

01:06:24.781 --> 01:06:29.186
WITH THE FIELD CLOSING IN
FAST BEHIND THEM,

01:06:29.219 --> 01:06:32.489
THE FINAL TWO RIDERS
THAT WILL QUALIFY.

01:06:32.522 --> 01:06:33.757
GO!

01:06:33.790 --> 01:06:37.061
UP THE "WALL"
FOR THE FINAL TIME.

01:06:37.094 --> 01:06:38.462
THEY'RE DOWN!

01:06:38.495 --> 01:06:39.663
OH, GOD!

01:06:42.632 --> 01:06:45.335
ONE RIDER IS BACK UP.

01:06:45.369 --> 01:06:47.237
HE'S GOING TO FINISH.

01:06:58.648 --> 01:07:00.217
RUN WITH IT!

01:07:00.250 --> 01:07:02.052
PICK IT UP!

01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:04.388
COME ON, DAVID!

01:07:08.725 --> 01:07:10.694
CAN HE DO THAT?

01:07:10.727 --> 01:07:11.795
RUN!

01:07:13.597 --> 01:07:15.565
GOOD, DAVE!

01:07:15.599 --> 01:07:17.434
COME ON!

01:07:17.467 --> 01:07:19.569
COME ON!
A LITTLE MORE!

01:07:19.603 --> 01:07:21.271
GOOD!

01:07:22.706 --> 01:07:25.175
COME ON, DAVID!

01:07:25.209 --> 01:07:26.843
YES!

01:07:26.876 --> 01:07:28.845
IN A REMARKABLE FINISH,

01:07:28.878 --> 01:07:30.847
DAVID SOMMERS
CROSSES THE LINE,

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:32.516
BUT CARRYING HIS BICYCLE.

01:07:32.549 --> 01:07:34.551
CAN HE DO THAT?

01:07:34.584 --> 01:07:36.186
IS THAT LEGAL?

01:07:36.220 --> 01:07:39.189
I THINK
I SCREWED UP.

01:07:39.223 --> 01:07:41.125
IT'S O.K.

01:07:41.158 --> 01:07:43.127
AND IT'S OFFICIAL,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:46.663
DAVID SOMMERS BECOMES THE 48th
AND FINAL QUALIFIER

01:07:46.696 --> 01:07:49.266
TO RIDE STAGES
TWO AND THREE

01:07:49.299 --> 01:07:51.201
OF THE HELL OF THE WEST.

01:07:51.235 --> 01:07:53.237
YOU GOT
TWO MORE STAGES!

01:07:53.270 --> 01:07:54.504
IT WAS CLOSE.

01:07:54.538 --> 01:07:55.639
OH, SHIT.

01:07:55.672 --> 01:07:58.242
CAN YOU TELL US
WHAT IT'S LIKE--

01:07:58.275 --> 01:08:00.644
IT'S A BIG DAY
FOR AMERICAN CYCLING

01:08:00.677 --> 01:08:03.180
TO HAVE TWO AMERICANS
BEAT AN OLYMPIC CHAMP.

01:08:03.213 --> 01:08:05.182
YOU MUST FEEL
SOME PRIDE.

01:08:05.215 --> 01:08:07.184
NO, I'M ALL RIGHT.

01:08:07.217 --> 01:08:08.585
I'M O.K.

01:08:08.618 --> 01:08:11.188
I'M NOT RIDING
FOR AMERICA, LADY.

01:08:11.221 --> 01:08:13.190
I TRIED
RIDING FOR AMERICA.

01:08:13.223 --> 01:08:16.292
I SPENT FOUR YEARS
WORKING SHITTY JOBS

01:08:16.326 --> 01:08:19.696
SO I COULD TRAIN
AND MAKE
THE OLYMPIC TEAM--

01:08:19.729 --> 01:08:20.863
LOOK AT ME.

01:08:20.897 --> 01:08:23.466
THEN SOME FAT-ASSES
IN WASHINGTON

01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:24.868
STARTED HAVING OPINIONS.

01:08:24.901 --> 01:08:27.470
THE OLYMPIC COMMITTEE
STARTED HAVING OPINIONS.

01:08:27.504 --> 01:08:29.473
YOU, YOU BITCH--
I KNOW YOU!

01:08:29.506 --> 01:08:31.475
YOU STARTED WRITING
YOUR OPINIONS.

01:08:31.508 --> 01:08:33.477
SO WE BOYCOTT
THE OLYMPICS.

01:08:33.510 --> 01:08:36.880
I WAS IN THE BEST SHAPE
OF MY LIFE IN 1980,

01:08:36.912 --> 01:08:38.881
AND I GOT BEAT
BY OPINIONS.

01:08:38.915 --> 01:08:41.885
IS THAT WHY
YOU'RE BOYCOTTING
THE VICTORY CEREMONY?

01:08:41.917 --> 01:08:44.488
WHAT VICTORY?
THERE'S TWO STAGES LEFT.

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:45.889
STILL, THE FACT REMAINS--

01:08:45.921 --> 01:08:47.890
YOU WOULDN'T KNOW
A FACT

01:08:47.924 --> 01:08:50.727
IF IT BANGED YOU
ALL NIGHT LONG!

01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:53.697
IN FIRST PLACE, THE LEADER
OF THE SHAVERSPORT TEAM,

01:08:53.729 --> 01:08:55.332
MARCUS SOMMERS!

01:09:19.223 --> 01:09:21.191
O.K., I GOT ONE.

01:09:21.225 --> 01:09:23.193
IT'S ABOUT DAVID.

01:09:23.227 --> 01:09:25.662
I WANT TO HEAR IT!

01:09:25.694 --> 01:09:28.598
DAVID'S ONLY 1O
AT THE TIME.

01:09:28.631 --> 01:09:32.569
HE COMES INTO MY BEDROOM
LOOKING REAL SERIOUS.

01:09:32.602 --> 01:09:36.372
HE WANTS TO KNOW
WHAT'S ORAL SEX?

01:09:36.406 --> 01:09:38.508
NOBODY WANTS TO
HEAR THIS!

01:09:38.542 --> 01:09:40.410
GO ON!

01:09:40.444 --> 01:09:43.680
GO ON, DAVID.
LET'S HEAR IT.

01:09:43.712 --> 01:09:45.314
HE SAYS,
"WHAT'S ORAL SEX?"

01:09:45.349 --> 01:09:48.318
I SAID, "ORAL SEX
IS THE OPPOSITE
OF WRITTEN SEX.

01:09:48.352 --> 01:09:50.720
"IF YOU READ ABOUT IT,
IT'S WRITTEN SEX,

01:09:50.754 --> 01:09:53.590
AND IF YOU TALK
ABOUT IT, IT'S..."

01:09:53.622 --> 01:09:55.625
ORAL SEX!
ORAL SEX!

01:09:55.659 --> 01:09:57.461
HA HA!
THAT'S GREAT!

01:09:57.494 --> 01:09:59.463
SO, ABOUT
THREE WEEKS LATER,

01:09:59.496 --> 01:10:02.766
HE GOES TO THIS
BIRTHDAY PARTY
FOR SHEILA FLETCHER.

01:10:02.799 --> 01:10:04.968
WHO'S
SHEILA FLETCHER?

01:10:05.001 --> 01:10:07.571
HE COMES BACK
IN 15 MINUTES.

01:10:07.604 --> 01:10:11.341
MOM AND DAD WANT TO KNOW
WHY HE CAME BACK SO QUICKLY.

01:10:11.375 --> 01:10:13.343
BECAUSE HE SAID
IT WAS BORING.

01:10:13.377 --> 01:10:15.779
EVERYBODY WAS JUST
STANDING AROUND
HAVING ORAL SEX.

01:10:19.583 --> 01:10:20.950
YOU GOT TO KNOW MY MOM.

01:10:20.984 --> 01:10:22.919
SHE FLEW OUT
OF THE APARTMENT--

01:10:22.952 --> 01:10:23.953
FLEW!

01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:38.735
THERE YOU ARE!

01:10:38.768 --> 01:10:40.737
GREAT.

01:10:40.770 --> 01:10:42.739
PROGRAM.

01:10:42.772 --> 01:10:44.741
PROGRAM.

01:10:44.774 --> 01:10:46.776
THANK YOU, CRAIG.

01:10:48.945 --> 01:10:49.979
IS YOUR NAME THERE?

01:10:50.013 --> 01:10:51.014
YEAH, SOMEWHERE.

01:10:51.881 --> 01:10:53.383
DAVID!

01:10:53.417 --> 01:10:56.720
YOU'RE ONLY 2 MINUTES
AND 11 SECONDS BEHIND

01:10:56.753 --> 01:10:58.488
IN THE STANDINGS.

01:10:58.522 --> 01:10:59.889
THAT'S GOOD.

01:10:59.923 --> 01:11:01.858
MARCUS, HOW MANY ROOMS?

01:11:01.891 --> 01:11:03.893
ONE FOR US.

01:11:03.927 --> 01:11:05.862
DAVID,
HOW MANY ROOMS?

01:11:16.105 --> 01:11:18.007
ONE FOR US.

01:11:18.041 --> 01:11:20.310
330.

01:11:26.115 --> 01:11:28.084
HOW'S YOUR LEG?

01:11:28.117 --> 01:11:29.686
IT'S FINE.

01:11:29.719 --> 01:11:31.688
REMEMBER,
WE'RE RACING TOMORROW.

01:11:31.721 --> 01:11:33.690
SEE YOU THEN.

01:11:33.723 --> 01:11:35.091
GOOD NIGHT.

01:11:35.124 --> 01:11:37.727
HEY!
WE'RE GOING TO WIN.

01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:45.469

01:11:45.502 --> 01:11:46.970
YEAH, I'M FINE.

01:11:50.407 --> 01:11:51.575

01:11:56.746 --> 01:11:58.348
MARCUS!

01:12:04.921 --> 01:12:06.456
* BEAUTIFUL TAN

01:12:06.490 --> 01:12:07.991

* BEAUTIFUL TAN

01:12:13.630 --> 01:12:15.064
* IT'S A DARK,
RICH TAN... **

01:12:15.098 --> 01:12:18.134
I THINK THIS WHOLE THING
WAS DESTINY.

01:12:18.167 --> 01:12:20.069
WHAT WHOLE THING?

01:12:20.103 --> 01:12:22.672
YOU AND ME.
THIS TRIP.

01:12:22.706 --> 01:12:25.074
THERE I WAS
AT McDONALD'S.

HERE WE GO,

01:44:54.021 --> 01:44:56.858
O.K., WE GOT HIM.

01:44:56.891 --> 01:44:59.427
NOW, JUST SIT BACK

01:44:59.461 --> 01:45:02.764

DAVID SOMMERS IN THE LEAD
COMING AROUND THE CORNER,

01:46:23.645 --> 01:46:25.513
BUT MUZZIN STILL HAS

01:46:25.547 --> 01:46:29.584
AN 11-SECOND TIME ADVANTAGE
ON HIM OVERALL.

01:46:29.617 --> 01:46:31.853
IF MUZZIN CROSSES THE LINE

01:46:31.886 --> 01:46:33.821
LESS THAN 11 SECONDS
AFTER SOMMERS,

01:46:33.855 --> 01:46:36.157
MUZZIN WILL
STILL BE THE WINNER.

THE OVERALL WINNER

01:47:23.905 --> 01:47:26.908
IF MUZZIN DOESN'T CROSS
THE FINISH LINE

01:47:26.941 --> 01:47:29.477
IN THE NEXT 11 SECONDS.

01:47:29.511 --> 01:47:30.945

01:47:45.092 --> 01:47:46.828
MUZZIN DIDN'T MAKE IT!

01:47:46.861 --> 01:47:49.497
DAVID SOMMERS
