WEBVTT

00:04.200 --> 00:07.901
Alright, locking it up.
Who needs a ride home?

00:10.623 --> 00:12.201
Come on, who needs a ride home?

00:12.333 --> 00:15.453
l guess we're all sober enough
to drive ourselves tonight.

00:15.670 --> 00:18.457
Looks like you get to go
straight home for a change.

00:18.590 --> 00:21.923
l've never driven straight home.
l wouldn't know how to do it.

00:22.052 --> 00:26.630
- OK, Coach. You can take me.
- What a prince.

00:26.765 --> 00:29.386
- Thanks, l owe you one.
- Any time.

00:29.518 --> 00:31.261
Goodnight now.

00:31.394 --> 00:32.889
Drop me off at Kenmore Square.

00:33.021 --> 00:35.939
l can catch a cab
to take me back here to my car.

00:37.000 --> 00:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:03.530 --> 02:05.653
What do you think you're doing?

02:05.782 --> 02:07.740
Just having a little late-night fun.

02:07.868 --> 02:10.822
Listen, pencil neck,
you're starting to get on my nerves.

02:13.749 --> 02:17.367
Please don't call me pencil neck.
l am not a pencil neck.

02:17.503 --> 02:18.665
l'm sorry.

02:18.796 --> 02:21.797
l didn't mean to call you
pencil neck, gozzlehead.

02:23.592 --> 02:27.542
Name calling.
The last refuge of the monosyllabic.

02:27.972 --> 02:30.973
l don't know what that means
but l heard slob in there.

02:32.643 --> 02:36.059
Hey, come on, Diane, Carla,
you go at each other every night.

02:36.188 --> 02:39.189
We're getting scouts in here
from the roller derby.

02:39.317 --> 02:42.650
Listen, l mean it. Do something
about this, or l'm gonna...

02:43.780 --> 02:45.902
l'm gonna think
about personnel changes.

02:46.032 --> 02:49.116
What choice do we have, Sam?
We don't like each other.

02:49.243 --> 02:51.913
No, Carla, Sam's... Carla.

02:52.580 --> 02:54.407
Sam's making good sense.

02:55.083 --> 02:58.249
You could knock me over
with a feather, but he is.

02:58.378 --> 03:01.747
We need to sit down together
and talk this out.

03:01.881 --> 03:04.123
That's nuts.
What's there to talk about?

03:04.259 --> 03:07.710
Listen. l want you to sit down
and settle this, or else.

03:09.055 --> 03:10.597
We'll do it.

03:10.724 --> 03:11.637
Carla

03:14.311 --> 03:15.306
Do it.

03:17.481 --> 03:22.855
- Can we use this table?
- Oh, you mean here? No.

03:22.986 --> 03:27.732
l was thinking more along the lines
of your homes or a coffee shop.

03:28.450 --> 03:30.324
Down by the docks, maybe.

03:31.286 --> 03:33.777
Sam. We'll lock up, don't worry about
it.

03:33.914 --> 03:36.405
Now is the time. This is the place.

03:36.542 --> 03:39.080
Unchecked rage
is like a festering wound.

03:39.545 --> 03:41.372
Laughs aplenty tonight.

03:42.256 --> 03:46.170
Look. You expect me to l leave the
two of you here without a referee?

03:46.302 --> 03:48.378
Come on. What could happen?

03:48.512 --> 03:49.841
Nothing.

03:49.972 --> 03:52.130
Two women left alone,
who hate each other,

03:52.266 --> 03:55.184
in a room filled
with glass and alcohol. Silly.

03:56.395 --> 04:02.101
- This was your idea. Bye.
- Alright. Check the locks twice, OK?

04:02.235 --> 04:03.610
Aye, aye, captain.

04:03.736 --> 04:06.773
And make sure the lights over the bar
are out.

04:06.906 --> 04:09.611
Lights over the bar. Right.
Goodnight.

04:11.911 --> 04:13.703
Maybe check the thermostat.

04:13.830 --> 04:18.326
We'll do that, yes.
Thank you, goodnight and goodbye.

04:23.965 --> 04:27.001
l have no life insurance.
Just this place.

04:28.970 --> 04:30.464
Goodnight.

04:34.851 --> 04:41.470
OK, let's sit down, relax and open
the lines of communication.

04:42.275 --> 04:43.983
l want a drink.

04:44.111 --> 04:46.780
Wonderful.
Let's have a bottle of wine.

04:46.905 --> 04:49.692
l think we've got your favourite.
ChÃ¢teau Guam.

04:51.869 --> 04:55.451
l'm talking a drink. l'll make it.

04:55.581 --> 04:57.657
Wonderful. OK.

04:57.791 --> 05:00.033
You're gonna like this.

05:03.589 --> 05:04.917
And then we use...

05:06.508 --> 05:08.881
l only do it for special occasions.

05:10.930 --> 05:13.884
Well, Carla, thank you. l'm honoured.

05:14.016 --> 05:17.183
You're really getting
into the spirit of this thing.

05:17.311 --> 05:19.268
- What's the drink?
- A family recipe.

05:19.397 --> 05:22.184
We call it Leap lnto An Open Grave.

05:24.694 --> 05:26.603
You're kidding.

05:26.737 --> 05:31.031
My Uncle Joe stumbled across it
when he was making a car bomb.

05:34.329 --> 05:36.321
You're kidding, right? Carla?

05:43.880 --> 05:45.873
One for good luck.

05:51.179 --> 05:52.128
Nice touch.

05:52.263 --> 05:56.641
Keep the glasses moving so the fumes
don't burn a hole in the ceiling.

06:11.950 --> 06:13.658
Delicious.

06:14.036 --> 06:15.945
And it goes right to your head.

06:16.079 --> 06:18.950
No one in my family lives past 43.

06:21.794 --> 06:24.795
OK, let's chat.

06:24.922 --> 06:27.164
l don't know what we're talking for.

06:27.299 --> 06:30.300
We're different people.
We'll never get along.

06:31.011 --> 06:33.847
- We're not totally different.
- Name one similarity.

06:34.557 --> 06:36.181
Well, we...

06:40.062 --> 06:42.351
We're both women.

06:43.190 --> 06:46.310
Why do l get the feeling
that we're jerking our chain, here?

06:50.114 --> 06:55.156
No, there's more.
We both share the same job.

06:55.787 --> 06:59.120
Of course,
l'm not as good at it as you are.

07:00.291 --> 07:02.747
lt doesn't take a genius to notice.

07:04.671 --> 07:06.129
But thank you.

07:07.048 --> 07:10.963
You know, Carla, l particularly
admire the way you handle passes.

07:11.094 --> 07:12.553
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

07:12.679 --> 07:14.506
A guy in the back room tonight
asked me

07:14.639 --> 07:19.467
if l wanted to play something called
The Shepherdess And The Hun.

07:23.106 --> 07:25.514
Which part did he want you to play?

07:31.114 --> 07:32.692
This is fun, isn't it?

07:34.868 --> 07:38.035
Easy give-and-take
between two working gals.

07:41.208 --> 07:44.458
You know,
l think we're coming together.

07:44.586 --> 07:46.413
That's the Open Grave.

07:46.547 --> 07:50.247
Give it another 1 5 minutes, you'll be
French-kissing the sump pump.

07:55.973 --> 07:59.674
No, seriously. We're connecting,
l'm certain of it.

08:02.229 --> 08:04.803
Yeah. People need people.

08:05.483 --> 08:10.145
l'm a people person. l can be there
for you, l wanna be there for you.

08:10.279 --> 08:13.280
Please, benefit from my depth.

08:15.576 --> 08:18.150
This stuff. Great.

08:21.124 --> 08:24.208
You would do that for me?
You'd listen to me?

08:25.461 --> 08:27.917
With all my heart, mind and soul.

08:30.341 --> 08:34.754
You know,... Thank you.

08:34.888 --> 08:37.924
There are moments when l wanna spill
my guts, know what l mean?

08:38.058 --> 08:39.303
Yes.

08:40.352 --> 08:43.057
l've got things,

08:43.188 --> 08:45.227
one thing in particular,

08:45.357 --> 08:49.307
that l've been carrying around
inside of me for a long time.

08:51.780 --> 08:53.239
Tell me.

08:54.032 --> 08:55.692
l barely know you.

08:56.368 --> 08:59.819
Well, Carla, you brought it up.
You obviously want to get it out.

09:00.456 --> 09:02.744
Maybe l do, but...

09:03.709 --> 09:08.335
Carla, l swear,
l'll keep my mouth shut. l swear.

09:18.849 --> 09:21.008
About five years ago...

09:22.103 --> 09:24.510
..Sam threw a party here.

09:24.647 --> 09:26.307
The big guy was still on the sauce

09:26.440 --> 09:29.774
so every night
was an excuse for a big bash.

09:32.572 --> 09:35.573
Anyway, this one time
he was too tanked to drive home.

09:36.409 --> 09:38.033
So l took him.

09:39.704 --> 09:42.456
l helped him upstairs....

09:43.541 --> 09:45.249
..to his bedroom.

09:48.463 --> 09:50.123
One thing led to another.

09:53.343 --> 09:55.964
Nine months later, Gino was born.

09:58.139 --> 10:01.093
- Gino?
- Sam's son.

10:11.945 --> 10:13.902
Carla, l don't believe this.

10:14.031 --> 10:16.522
Me neither, you're gonna die.

10:20.412 --> 10:22.321
Sam.

10:25.084 --> 10:26.744
Sam did this?

10:34.134 --> 10:35.961
He's a beast.

10:36.637 --> 10:41.513
No. Sam's been really good about it.

10:41.642 --> 10:45.225
l mean,
he's always helped out with the kid.

10:45.354 --> 10:47.561
l've never blamed him for anything.

10:48.399 --> 10:50.392
lt's as much my fault as his.

10:52.361 --> 10:56.490
But you bore the child,
you're raising the child.

10:57.658 --> 11:00.232
You plucky little soldier, you.

11:05.333 --> 11:08.998
Sam and l are the only ones
that know, understand?

11:13.591 --> 11:18.799
Carla, l...
l just wanna hug you right now.

11:20.849 --> 11:23.091
l feel kinda close to you, too.

11:30.317 --> 11:31.977
<i>People</i>

11:38.158 --> 11:41.195
<i>People who need people</i>

11:43.080 --> 11:44.622
Good God.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.242
Carla, my gumba.

11:56.427 --> 12:00.804
l like somebody who knows
when she's had enough.

12:04.769 --> 12:09.347
Hi. Sorry l'm back,
l forgot my bubblegum.

12:10.149 --> 12:11.691
l know that sounds crazy...

12:11.817 --> 12:13.775
Oh, my God, Carla, you killed her.

12:19.033 --> 12:21.738
Don't get your hopes up, Sam.
l just mixed her a drink.

12:21.869 --> 12:25.238
Carla, you made her an Open Grave.

12:26.249 --> 12:30.163
Yeah. And she leaped right in.

12:30.295 --> 12:32.786
She's out cold.
This is irresponsible.

12:33.381 --> 12:37.249
- l tried to slow her down.
- l'm gonna take her home.

12:37.385 --> 12:40.386
- Will you get her things for me?
- Sure.

12:42.766 --> 12:44.758
Did you straighten things out?

12:44.893 --> 12:47.135
Yeah. You know, it was great.

12:47.270 --> 12:48.646
She got sickening,

12:48.772 --> 12:52.639
l told the biggest lie l could
think of and she started to sing.

12:55.946 --> 12:59.730
- Why did you do that?
- She brings out the devil in me.

13:00.367 --> 13:03.617
l dunno. l was
getting a buzz on feeling loose.

13:03.745 --> 13:05.738
l decided to have some fun with her.

13:05.873 --> 13:07.533
What did you tell her?

13:07.666 --> 13:10.038
Sam, it's something l told Diane.

13:10.169 --> 13:13.454
She swore she would never tell
another living soul.

13:13.589 --> 13:15.463
She'll tell you tomorrow.

13:28.104 --> 13:30.974
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm.

13:31.107 --> 13:34.807
- How's it going?
- Daddy's rich, Mamma's good-lookin'!

13:40.908 --> 13:41.904
Good evening.

13:42.035 --> 13:46.163
Hi, Diane. How are you?

13:47.540 --> 13:50.826
Hey, Sis,
how's my buddy feeling today?

13:50.960 --> 13:51.992
Well,...

13:53.129 --> 13:56.913
..l got up this morning,
washed my face.

13:57.384 --> 13:59.423
l shaved my tongue.

14:00.387 --> 14:01.845
l came right in.

14:04.683 --> 14:06.722
However,

14:06.852 --> 14:08.429
no regrets.

14:08.562 --> 14:11.349
Evenings like that
come seldom in a lifetime.

14:13.066 --> 14:15.308
- How are you, Carla?
- Fine, thanks.

14:16.528 --> 14:18.651
How is poor little Gino?

14:27.664 --> 14:29.491
A little hung over, are we?

14:29.625 --> 14:32.579
l can't keep anything from you.

14:32.711 --> 14:35.167
You know,
l know something to stop hangovers.

14:35.923 --> 14:37.750
Thank God. What is it?

14:37.883 --> 14:39.627
Don't drink so much.

14:39.760 --> 14:41.385
Thank you.

14:42.930 --> 14:45.338
But thank you, Sam. Truly.

14:46.308 --> 14:49.309
For getting Carla and l together
at last.

14:49.437 --> 14:51.061
You're welcome.

14:51.188 --> 14:54.059
She really is a wonderful woman,
isn't she?

14:54.191 --> 14:56.599
Yeah. She's alright.

14:56.736 --> 15:00.271
And her children
are truly wonderful, too.

15:00.573 --> 15:03.491
Yeah,
if you like chainsaws with feet.

15:06.412 --> 15:11.454
But l understand that Gino is
an extraordinarily fine young man.

15:11.918 --> 15:13.293
Which one's he?

15:15.296 --> 15:17.787
He's... who he is.

15:24.389 --> 15:28.553
- Sam, where's my bourbon and ginger?
- Coming right up.

15:28.685 --> 15:30.927
You're slipping, sweetheart.

15:36.193 --> 15:38.399
- You're staring at me.
- Oh, was l?

15:38.528 --> 15:40.272
Right through me, in fact.

15:40.405 --> 15:42.694
l've got to get home
to the little lady.

15:42.824 --> 15:46.525
- lt's my tenth wedding anniversary.
- Congratulations.

15:46.662 --> 15:49.069
- Big plans, huh?
- The biggest.

15:49.206 --> 15:54.034
We're going out for a pizza. lt gets
me back here about ten o'clock.

15:59.592 --> 16:03.506
A whole quarter.
l'm gonna name the Ferrari after you.

16:03.637 --> 16:06.389
- Now look here, miss...
- No, you look...

16:06.515 --> 16:10.727
- My office now.
- lt's a whole dollar below insult.

16:10.853 --> 16:13.095
- Carla, right now.
- Sam.

16:13.230 --> 16:16.730
lt wasn't her fault.
She was deliberately snubbed.

16:16.859 --> 16:18.567
Diane, she's my employee.

16:18.694 --> 16:21.399
This is none of your business.
Stay out of it.

16:23.533 --> 16:28.242
Coach,
Sam just called Carla ''an employee''.

16:28.371 --> 16:31.574
No kidding. How did Carla take it?

16:33.376 --> 16:37.789
- What do you think he's gonna do?
- Nothing. Bawl her out a little.

16:37.922 --> 16:42.050
How dare he chastise her?
She can barely scrape out a living.

16:42.177 --> 16:44.502
How much suffering
does she have to do?

16:44.638 --> 16:48.338
She's raising four children, not
to mention one of them is Sam's...

16:49.601 --> 16:51.759
One of Carla's kids is Sam's kid?

16:52.437 --> 16:58.357
- No. l didn't say that.
- Let me figure this out, now.

17:00.612 --> 17:04.112
Sam knows Carla five years, right?

17:04.241 --> 17:07.325
Carla's youngest kid, Gino,
is seven and a half.

17:07.452 --> 17:09.611
That's it. lt works out.

17:11.540 --> 17:12.536
Wait a minute.

17:14.001 --> 17:17.085
- Gino is seven and a half years old?
- Yeah.

17:17.212 --> 17:20.498
And Sam and Carla have
only known each other five years?

17:20.633 --> 17:24.251
Right, but who would ever figure
that Gino was Sam's kid?

17:28.140 --> 17:30.429
She lied.

17:30.559 --> 17:32.469
She deliberately lied.

17:33.521 --> 17:36.012
You mean that Gino's not Sam's kid?

17:36.148 --> 17:37.144
No.

17:37.275 --> 17:41.142
Holy mackerel! This is gonna break
Sam's heart when he hears this.

17:43.781 --> 17:45.774
l reached out to her.

17:45.908 --> 17:47.284
That weasel.

17:48.202 --> 17:48.984
Coach,

17:49.120 --> 17:53.284
what do you do when you are so
furious you have to do something?

17:53.416 --> 17:58.208
Well, l know you'll think it's crazy,
but l bang my head on the bar.

18:01.800 --> 18:04.670
Doesn't sound crazy to me.
lt might do me good right now.

18:04.803 --> 18:06.380
Well, OK.

18:07.806 --> 18:13.144
- No, don't. Stop that, please.
- You feel better?

18:14.729 --> 18:16.936
Yes. Thank you.

18:17.065 --> 18:18.773
- How about you?
- l feel fine.

18:18.900 --> 18:21.189
To me, it's kind of a picker-upper.

18:23.280 --> 18:28.108
Hello. My name is Carla.
l'll be your slave for the evening.

18:29.286 --> 18:33.414
No, l won't do it.
l won't give her the satisfaction.

18:33.540 --> 18:37.620
She's just waiting for me
to break her confidence.

18:37.753 --> 18:40.920
She can play me for the fool,
but she will not tarnish my dignity.

18:41.048 --> 18:42.839
This is none of your concern.

18:45.469 --> 18:48.221
Hello, my friend,
my dearest confidante.

18:48.347 --> 18:50.636
How's your rotten,
lying little mouth?

18:52.977 --> 18:55.183
Got you.

18:55.313 --> 18:59.227
''One thing led to another,
and then Gino was born.''

18:59.358 --> 19:01.232
l knew it. l knew you'd tell.

19:01.360 --> 19:03.898
You had to tell somebody
our secret to find out.

19:04.030 --> 19:05.939
- That's beside the point.
- lt isn't.

19:06.073 --> 19:09.774
l knew you couldn't keep it. You hold
your secrets like your booze.

19:11.704 --> 19:14.954
Telling me that story
was reprehensible.

19:15.083 --> 19:18.499
Lighten up.
You wanna be my friend?

19:18.628 --> 19:21.036
You wanna get along?
Let your hair down.

19:21.172 --> 19:24.339
How about l take your hair
and scour the sink with it?

19:27.470 --> 19:29.843
ls that a Brillo shot?

19:32.267 --> 19:33.975
Only if it offends you.

19:34.811 --> 19:38.595
You sound like a lady
who is getting tired of her teeth.

19:40.942 --> 19:44.643
l'm tired of your teeth
and all the vermicelli in between.

19:50.160 --> 19:51.868
ln my office.

19:59.503 --> 20:01.330
Be quiet!

20:02.506 --> 20:05.080
l think Sammy can handle that one,
huh, Coach?

20:05.676 --> 20:08.594
l hate to see that kind of thing
between women.

20:08.721 --> 20:13.513
l know what you mean, Coach.
Women fighting is very unladylike.

20:13.642 --> 20:17.177
Unless, of course,
they're wallowing around in mudpits.

20:19.982 --> 20:23.647
Now, somebody,
please, tell me what's going on.

20:24.320 --> 20:27.072
Last night,
out of the goodness of my heart,

20:27.198 --> 20:30.199
l reached out to this little twerp.

20:30.702 --> 20:33.821
And she deliberately duped me
into believing

20:33.955 --> 20:37.240
that you were
the father of one of her children.

20:37.375 --> 20:42.120
- Me?
- Yes. She referred to it as a joke.

20:43.047 --> 20:44.672
Snicker, snicker.

20:44.799 --> 20:48.749
l told her we fooled around once
and Gino was the result.

20:49.262 --> 20:50.425
Gino?

20:51.431 --> 20:53.305
You told her that you and...?

20:53.433 --> 20:55.307
You thought that she and l...?

20:56.478 --> 20:58.055
Gino?

21:00.899 --> 21:02.393
Your Gino?

21:08.448 --> 21:12.398
You should have seen her face.
Her chin was in her lap.

21:14.872 --> 21:18.323
Of course, laugh at the fool.
Laugh at my expense.

21:18.459 --> 21:21.032
- Show her a picture of Gino.
- Yeah, OK.

21:44.360 --> 21:48.939
You think he's funny-looking. You
wanna see what makes Gino laugh?

21:49.073 --> 21:51.362
- His real dad.
- Let me see.

22:33.744 --> 22:35.950
Look, Whitey, l'm sorry.

22:37.372 --> 22:39.994
l know l can be a real pain
sometimes.

22:42.670 --> 22:47.545
And l know that l take things
a little too seriously at times.

22:47.675 --> 22:49.632
l guess
l need to be reminded of that.

22:49.760 --> 22:52.429
Well, l'll always be there for you.

22:53.264 --> 22:56.300
Listen,
l want you two to shake hands.

23:05.234 --> 23:06.812
You're alright.

23:08.946 --> 23:11.235
Maybe we can go to a movie one night.

23:11.365 --> 23:13.025
Fine. When?

23:13.159 --> 23:15.484
l'll get back to you.

23:16.496 --> 23:21.952
l'm proud of you, l really am,
for holding your own with Carla.

23:23.044 --> 23:25.167
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

23:25.922 --> 23:30.335
Sam, could l ask
a little off-the-cuff question?

23:30.468 --> 23:32.212
Sure.

23:32.345 --> 23:34.836
Who took me home last night?
You or Carla?

23:36.433 --> 23:37.844
You don't remember?

23:38.685 --> 23:39.681
No.

23:40.645 --> 23:42.472
We both did.

23:43.607 --> 23:46.062
Who put my pyjamas on?

23:48.195 --> 23:52.656
- Carla did.
- You'd already left by that time?

23:52.783 --> 23:55.737
No. l was still there.

23:57.496 --> 23:58.871
You mean watching?

23:58.997 --> 24:02.995
No. l was in the other room,
minding my own business.

24:03.627 --> 24:05.620
On my good behaviour.

24:05.754 --> 24:07.830
Trying on your lingerie.
