very attractive to women

about the singing

too many things separately,

isn't air conditioned.

a good time

that we should make an effort

person likes.

19:57.153 --> 19:58.364
Hey, are you a single?

19:58.364 --> 19:59.698
Yes.
I'm third row center.

19:59.698 --> 20:01.825
Can we swap so I can sit next
to my friend?

20:01.825 --> 20:04.370
Sure.
Thank you, heh, heh.

20:04.370 --> 20:07.623
Hey, there!
This is great.

20:07.623 --> 20:08.123
[LAUGHS]

20:08.039 --> 20:12.211
Well, pretty lady. So you guys
are still together, huh?

20:12.211 --> 20:13.587
All right.

20:13.587 --> 20:15.256
Hey, you wanna grab
a bite after?

20:15.256 --> 20:18.842
It's on me, I cleaned up
in Atlantic City.

20:20.677 --> 20:21.970
Is your weekend booked?

20:21.970 --> 20:24.681
Because we have got
a sweet foosball table

20:24.681 --> 20:25.932
at the rec room
at my complex.

20:25.932 --> 20:30.020
The teenagers usually hog it,
but sometimes you get lucky.

20:30.020 --> 20:32.898
If not,
we can hit the jacooz,

20:32.898 --> 20:33.690
get our soak on!

20:33.690 --> 20:35.609
You're not supposed
to go in naked,

20:35.609 --> 20:36.610
but I probably will. Heh.

20:36.610 --> 20:40.239
I don't like to get urine
on my shorts.

20:40.239 --> 20:43.074
