00:46.560 --> 00:48.408
Farouk's looking for Cleopatra,

00:53.016 --> 00:55.835
I need the entire file
on Operation Paperclip.

00:55.952 --> 00:57.713
The top secret U.S. program.

01:05.625 --> 01:06.744
Vaziri.

01:06.750 --> 01:08.696
I'd say your father
was in the Brotherhood.

01:08.702 --> 01:10.699
- So it's not true?
- No.

01:10.705 --> 01:12.433
Can you trace this for me?

01:12.439 --> 01:13.799
It's one of Lexi's underworld

01:13.805 --> 01:15.370
contacts she's been texting with.

01:16.403 --> 01:18.539
He's in the Brotherhood of Serapis.

01:18.545 --> 01:21.428
I gave that number to Gwen.
Fabi's number, to trace.

01:36.796 --> 01:39.393
I had this terrible dream
that I was thrown into hell,

01:39.399 --> 01:41.757
and this angel, who
sounded a lot like Chuck,

01:41.763 --> 01:45.166
was screaming about me
befouling his bedroom.

01:45.233 --> 01:47.635
That wasn't entirely a dream.

01:47.703 --> 01:51.005
Chuck left town for a
conference early this morning.

01:51.073 --> 01:54.709
On his way out the door, he
loudly expressed his concerns

01:54.715 --> 01:56.706
about what would happen
here while he's gone.

01:56.712 --> 01:58.346
He's ridiculous.

01:58.352 --> 01:59.919
Completely. Wait.

01:59.925 --> 02:01.960
How do you mean?

02:02.150 --> 02:04.652
I mean we won't befoul his bedroom,

02:04.720 --> 02:07.722
or anything in general,
I guess, together.

02:07.789 --> 02:10.699
I think maybe the word
"befoul" isn't helping here.

02:10.705 --> 02:12.739
Are you saying you want
to just keep things

02:12.745 --> 02:14.321
professional between us?

02:14.327 --> 02:15.927
I think so.

02:16.498 --> 02:17.865
We should, right?

02:17.871 --> 02:21.040
I mean, we're a disaster when
we get together, every time.

02:21.169 --> 02:22.670
You're not wrong.

02:26.675 --> 02:30.010
So is that the file the FBI gave you?

02:30.078 --> 02:32.747
Operation... I want to say... Stapler?

02:32.753 --> 02:34.472
Paperclip. Operation Paperclip.

02:34.478 --> 02:35.717
I was close.

02:35.723 --> 02:36.979
Have you found where the U.S.

02:36.985 --> 02:38.519
hid all its Nazi scientists?

02:38.525 --> 02:41.345
Well, there's detailed information here

02:41.351 --> 02:43.224
on German U-boats and shipping routes,

02:43.230 --> 02:45.665
but looks like most of these ratlines,

02:45.671 --> 02:48.473
which were the escape
routes for Nazi fascists,

02:48.479 --> 02:50.414
were facilitated out of Spain.

02:50.420 --> 02:52.199
And since the Nazis with Cleopatra

02:52.205 --> 02:53.806
were forced to detour to Casablanca,

02:53.812 --> 02:56.493
- all the information is useless.
- Not necessarily.

02:56.499 --> 02:59.201
One of the failures
in the lead up to 9/11

02:59.207 --> 03:01.083
was that the intelligence agencies

03:01.089 --> 03:02.505
weren't talking to each other.

03:02.511 --> 03:04.278
Now, there's only one
other agency who cares

03:04.346 --> 03:06.280
about finding Cleopatra
as much as we do...

03:06.348 --> 03:07.648
The Brotherhood of Serapis.

03:07.716 --> 03:09.817
Yeah, they must've been
tracking the Nazis back then.

03:09.885 --> 03:11.819
Maybe together we can connect the dots.

03:11.887 --> 03:13.621
I'll bring it to Fabi.

03:13.627 --> 03:15.395
We'll bring it to him.

03:33.728 --> 03:35.988
What's so urgent you couldn't
tell me on the phone?

03:35.994 --> 03:37.011
Hey.

03:37.978 --> 03:40.776
I think it's time we talked.

03:40.782 --> 03:43.284
Yes. He knows everything I do.

03:43.485 --> 03:45.142
She's a thief and a liar.

03:45.148 --> 03:46.675
And you're a double agent.

03:46.681 --> 03:48.480
And I can have both of you arrested

03:48.486 --> 03:50.129
and thrown into a prison cell.

03:50.135 --> 03:52.384
- You're not gonna do that.
- Why not?

03:52.390 --> 03:54.716
I took the precaution
of ensuring our safety.

03:54.722 --> 03:58.674
In the event that anything
happens to either of us,

03:59.316 --> 04:01.189
I left a file with a friend

04:01.195 --> 04:02.908
to be sent to the FBI

04:03.091 --> 04:05.126
that reveals your identity as a member

04:05.132 --> 04:06.881
of the Brotherhood of Serapis,

04:07.552 --> 04:09.344
which is implicated in at least

04:09.350 --> 04:11.018
one murder that we know of,

04:11.024 --> 04:12.473
Max Najjar.

04:13.949 --> 04:16.450
You'll be the one who
ends up in a prison cell.

04:16.517 --> 04:18.219
So how's about we skip the anger

04:18.286 --> 04:20.688
and denial portion and get
right to acceptance, shall we?

04:20.755 --> 04:22.323
We've got a lot to discuss.

04:24.277 --> 04:25.811
What do you want?

04:25.817 --> 04:28.085
We're suggesting an alliance.

04:28.269 --> 04:29.924
You want Cleopatra.

04:29.930 --> 04:31.410
We want Farouk.

04:31.566 --> 04:35.336
Now we can be enemies,
but if Farouk wins,

04:35.403 --> 04:37.945
people die and Cleopatra likely

04:37.951 --> 04:40.356
gets destroyed in the process.

04:41.877 --> 04:43.077
Operation Paperclip.

04:43.083 --> 04:44.807
The U.S. government's
effort to shelter

04:44.813 --> 04:46.813
Nazi scientists to help
them win the Cold War.

04:46.819 --> 04:48.653
I know what it is.

04:48.659 --> 04:51.252
We've been looking for this for years.

04:51.258 --> 04:52.882
- How did you get it?
- Doesn't matter.

04:52.888 --> 04:54.655
What matters is, it's real.

04:54.723 --> 04:57.758
Now, the Nazis made it to
Casablanca with Cleopatra.

04:58.178 --> 05:00.684
We know they left
the gold sarcophagus there

05:00.690 --> 05:02.763
and took the inner
coffin with her in it.

05:02.769 --> 05:04.164
Can you help us narrow down

05:04.170 --> 05:05.637
where they went after that?

05:05.767 --> 05:07.474
Nazi hunters have already found

05:07.480 --> 05:09.139
many of the names on this list

05:09.145 --> 05:10.863
and brought them to justice.

05:11.219 --> 05:13.688
Others I recognize from
our own operations.

05:13.975 --> 05:16.944
I eliminated two of them myself.

05:19.347 --> 05:20.993
Based on Lexi's tip,

05:21.637 --> 05:23.112
we've been looking into

05:23.118 --> 05:25.786
shipping manifests from the
Port Authority in Casablanca.

05:25.854 --> 05:28.289
We know they left on one of three ships.

05:28.356 --> 05:30.524
Two were destined for Argentina,

05:30.592 --> 05:32.825
which was a Nazi haven after the war.

05:32.831 --> 05:34.295
Let's go get her.

05:36.364 --> 05:38.581
The Brotherhood

05:38.587 --> 05:40.382
has maintained ourselves

05:40.388 --> 05:41.463
for millennia

05:41.469 --> 05:44.705
by being very careful
about who we work with.

05:44.711 --> 05:45.878
Well, your bosses

05:45.884 --> 05:48.270
don't even need to know
we were working together.

05:52.011 --> 05:54.081
I think I know where to go,

05:54.211 --> 05:56.651
but I have to consult
our archives to get

05:56.657 --> 05:58.213
the exact location.

05:58.402 --> 06:00.682
Meet me at the train station

06:00.844 --> 06:02.065
in two hours.

06:02.285 --> 06:03.886
We'll take the long way out of Rome

06:03.892 --> 06:05.960
so no one tracks us.

06:06.027 --> 06:08.065
We'll be there. Also,

06:08.071 --> 06:09.718
get rid of your phone

06:09.724 --> 06:11.079
soon as you can.

06:11.085 --> 06:13.934
I, found Lexi's burner
phone in Casablanca.

06:14.002 --> 06:15.736
Didn't know who was
on the other end of it,

06:15.742 --> 06:17.342
so I gave Gwen the number to track.

06:18.204 --> 06:20.975
Just be careful, she may be onto you.

06:46.735 --> 06:47.868
Going somewhere?

06:54.144 --> 06:55.912
Don't.

07:35.268 --> 07:37.775
You're under arrest for
the murder of Max Najjar.

07:40.359 --> 07:45.138
- Synced and corrected by medvidecek007 -
- www.addic7ed.com -

08:15.938 --> 08:18.206
- We're screwed.
- We're fine.

08:18.359 --> 08:20.972
As far as I see it, we have one option.

08:22.330 --> 08:24.198
This, this is the carabinieri.

08:24.265 --> 08:26.433
The holding cells they're
keeping Fabi are here.

08:26.501 --> 08:28.936
We need a truck. I know how
to get us an untraceable one.

08:28.942 --> 08:30.276
We'll back it up here.

08:30.348 --> 08:31.782
We'll also need some misdirection.

08:31.788 --> 08:34.594
- I know a great explosives guy.
- Let me stop you right there.

08:34.600 --> 08:37.206
First of all, your plan
is to break Fabi out

08:37.212 --> 08:38.763
of the carabinieri like it's the

08:38.769 --> 08:40.318
sheriff's office in a Western?

08:40.325 --> 08:42.493
At least I'm pitching things

08:42.499 --> 08:44.511
and not doodling on a map of Argentina.

08:44.517 --> 08:45.778
I wasn't doodling.

08:45.784 --> 08:47.716
The areas in black are potential places

08:47.722 --> 08:49.714
the Nazis might have taken Cleopatra.

08:49.720 --> 08:50.992
It's the whole country.

08:54.129 --> 08:56.267
And most of the continent.

08:56.273 --> 08:58.861
So your brilliant plan,
as I understand it,

08:58.867 --> 09:01.435
is for us to go door-to-door
across South America

09:01.441 --> 09:03.241
searching for Nazis for
the rest of our lives?

09:03.247 --> 09:04.614
Actually, no.

09:04.620 --> 09:06.102
I just got off the phone with

09:06.108 --> 09:07.536
a client of mine, Mrs. Hoffman.

09:07.542 --> 09:09.165
Not the Mrs. Hoffman?

09:09.171 --> 09:12.373
Long story short, I found a way
for us to narrow our search.

09:12.647 --> 09:14.615
It's just gonna take
a bit of a side trip.

09:14.621 --> 09:16.255
- Where?
- Poland.

09:16.261 --> 09:18.296
Poland? That's hours
in the wrong direction.

09:18.302 --> 09:20.025
Yes, Poland is hours
in the wrong direction,

09:20.031 --> 09:21.884
but it's also where Moshe Cohen lives.

09:21.890 --> 09:23.862
He's ex-Mossad and a Nazi hunter,

09:23.868 --> 09:26.303
and he knows Argentina
like the back of his hand.

09:26.309 --> 09:28.090
Mrs. Hoffman's known
him since he was a baby.

09:28.096 --> 09:29.463
Why can't we just phone him?

09:29.469 --> 09:31.436
We can't just phone him
because he's a recluse.

09:31.442 --> 09:32.709
Doesn't have a phone.

09:32.721 --> 09:35.522
There's no way to contact
him except in person.

09:36.480 --> 09:39.067
Yes, you can finish the
crackers before we go.

09:45.320 --> 09:47.709
_

09:47.715 --> 09:49.283
Okay,

09:49.289 --> 09:51.156
this guy has spent decades

09:51.279 --> 09:52.714
hunting down Nazis

09:52.720 --> 09:55.189
and terrorists, then decided
to move back to the country

09:55.195 --> 09:57.953
where three million Jews were
rounded up to be murdered.

09:57.959 --> 09:59.326
That's pretty gangster.

09:59.394 --> 10:02.396
Yup. So he's understandably
concerned about security.

10:02.402 --> 10:04.511
Just let me do the talking.

10:09.604 --> 10:13.006
I'm guessing the sign
says "No trespassing"?

10:13.074 --> 10:15.008
That was a close call.

10:26.856 --> 10:28.857
Crap. No, no, no, no,
no, no. Don't move.

10:28.911 --> 10:30.679
Bloody hell.

10:30.685 --> 10:33.007
It's a pressure sensitive
plate for a bomb.

10:34.596 --> 10:37.831
I always assumed l'd be
the one to get us killed.

10:37.837 --> 10:40.839
I'm filled with so many
contradictory emotions.

10:41.884 --> 10:43.051
Who are you,

10:43.304 --> 10:45.005
and what are you doing here?

10:49.512 --> 10:51.279
Mrs. Hoffman sent us.

10:52.516 --> 10:54.059
I... I represented her.

10:54.126 --> 10:55.727
Her family had a Vermeer?

10:56.328 --> 10:58.087
The painting was seized
by the Nazis in...

10:58.093 --> 10:59.718
Long story short, Danny got it back.

10:59.724 --> 11:01.732
- I got this.
- Doesn't seem like you do.

11:01.738 --> 11:03.769
Well, if you'd stop interrupting me.

11:03.775 --> 11:05.175
So you two are a couple?

11:05.181 --> 11:07.439
- We're trying to figure things out.
- It's complicated.

11:07.760 --> 11:10.414
Mr. Cohen, we're trying
to stop a terrorist,

11:10.420 --> 11:12.690
and we need your help.

11:20.766 --> 11:23.209
I am sorry about my

11:23.215 --> 11:25.158
inhospitable greeting.

11:26.653 --> 11:29.292
But in my line of work, you
can never be too careful.

11:30.270 --> 11:32.171
So who is this terrorist?

11:32.239 --> 11:33.606
Karim Farouk.

11:35.008 --> 11:36.907
I am aware of him.

11:37.644 --> 11:40.730
Apparently, reports of
his death were premature.

11:40.736 --> 11:42.431
He's most definitely

11:42.437 --> 11:44.679
alive, and he's looking for a treasure

11:44.685 --> 11:47.253
to be used somehow in
a terrorist attack.

11:47.321 --> 11:49.564
We need to find it first to stop him.

11:50.157 --> 11:52.358
Who did he take from you?

11:53.627 --> 11:55.761
I know the look in your eyes.

11:55.829 --> 11:57.763
You want vengeance.

11:58.516 --> 12:00.399
Farouk killed my dad.

12:02.695 --> 12:04.509
What kind of treasure is he after?

12:04.880 --> 12:06.955
In 1942, the Nazis raided

12:06.961 --> 12:08.870
the tomb of Antony and Cleopatra.

12:08.876 --> 12:11.410
They escaped with Cleopatra only.

12:11.478 --> 12:14.547
Farouk has stolen Antony and
is now looking for Cleopatra.

12:15.750 --> 12:18.551
So you want to track
the Nazis who took her?

12:18.619 --> 12:19.968
Did you ever hear anything

12:19.974 --> 12:21.524
while you were in Argentina?

12:21.530 --> 12:23.146
Anything that could help us

12:23.152 --> 12:25.082
zero in on where they went?

12:28.795 --> 12:31.527
The Nazis plundered many things

12:31.919 --> 12:34.050
from many people,

12:34.301 --> 12:35.635
but only the occultists

12:35.641 --> 12:37.798
would have had any
interest in Cleopatra.

12:38.567 --> 12:40.473
So that means you are looking

12:40.479 --> 12:42.647
for Colonel Jürgen Steiner's group.

12:45.800 --> 12:47.567
This box is like a...

12:47.635 --> 12:50.696
Like an anchor tied to my soul.

12:50.702 --> 12:52.879
I would like to cut it loose, but...

12:54.379 --> 12:56.916
What would I be without it?

12:59.647 --> 13:01.499
This is Colonel Steiner.

13:02.245 --> 13:04.203
I never found the bastard.

13:07.065 --> 13:08.599
Have you ever seen

13:08.605 --> 13:11.196
the file on Operation Paperclip?

13:13.561 --> 13:15.495
I...

13:17.765 --> 13:20.120
I knew of the operation's existence.

13:21.347 --> 13:22.997
Not the name, but the...

13:23.606 --> 13:25.307
The effect.

13:25.778 --> 13:28.608
It became much harder to
bring these men to justice

13:28.614 --> 13:31.749
when the U.S. government
was protecting them.

13:32.271 --> 13:34.559
Well, combined with what you know,

13:35.244 --> 13:37.846
maybe we can finally
figure out what happened

13:37.852 --> 13:39.714
to Colonel Steiner and Cleopatra.

13:45.502 --> 13:46.897
How long have you been a member

13:46.903 --> 13:48.212
of the Brotherhood of Serapis?

13:48.218 --> 13:50.196
This is ridiculous. I'm being set up.

13:50.202 --> 13:52.837
Fabi, I know you're a double agent.

13:52.843 --> 13:54.234
After I gave you the intel that

13:54.240 --> 13:55.762
led us to Farouk's safe house

13:55.768 --> 13:59.237
in Libya, coincidentally, Max
Najjar showed up dead there.

14:00.493 --> 14:01.778
We know Max Najjar is connected

14:01.784 --> 14:03.647
to the Brotherhood of Serapis, so

14:04.811 --> 14:07.280
did you kill him to keep him quiet?

14:09.750 --> 14:11.718
Have you been using me this whole time

14:11.785 --> 14:13.820
to help the Brotherhood?

14:13.888 --> 14:15.822
I have done nothing inconsistent

14:15.828 --> 14:17.762
with the goals of the carabinieri.

14:17.892 --> 14:20.109
Then help me understand why

14:20.115 --> 14:22.285
you did what you did to Max Najjar.

14:23.684 --> 14:27.000
Who have you been
communicating with?

14:28.269 --> 14:30.270
Who is this?

14:34.691 --> 14:36.608
Steiner's occultist group of

14:36.614 --> 14:38.599
Nazis was keeping Cleopatra

14:38.605 --> 14:39.913
in Castle Schädelberg

14:39.919 --> 14:41.687
near Gruneland Dam in Bavaria.

14:41.815 --> 14:43.583
They had a replica of Cleopatra's tomb

14:43.589 --> 14:45.609
and a bunch of lab equipment.

14:45.615 --> 14:48.121
A radionics lab, most likely.

14:48.834 --> 14:52.125
Grenzwissenschaft, border science,

14:52.193 --> 14:54.419
a mix of the occult with the

14:54.425 --> 14:56.968
scientific method of the time.

14:57.031 --> 14:58.680
That explains why they needed

14:58.686 --> 15:01.135
a damn nearby, to power their lab.

15:01.468 --> 15:04.237
I don't know what their
plans were for Cleopatra.

15:04.243 --> 15:07.599
It was something called Projekt Athena.

15:07.605 --> 15:09.943
It's referenced here
in the Paperclip file.

15:10.010 --> 15:11.446
Project was put on hold when

15:11.452 --> 15:13.373
the castle was bombed and they fled.

15:13.379 --> 15:16.344
We've confirmed they took
Cleopatra from Germany

15:16.350 --> 15:18.818
all the way to Casablanca
by way of Spain.

15:18.886 --> 15:20.653
Not Steiner.

15:20.659 --> 15:22.593
He was separated from the group.

15:22.723 --> 15:24.455
Disappeared, apparently, with

15:24.461 --> 15:26.431
the help of the U.S. government

15:26.437 --> 15:29.224
in exchange for help
against the Soviets.

15:29.230 --> 15:32.914
As far as I know, he made
it to Austria in the '90s.

15:33.589 --> 15:35.923
And from there, his trail goes cold.

15:35.929 --> 15:39.231
I-I never found a sign
of him in Argentina.

15:39.291 --> 15:42.093
You know, according to the
shipping manifests we received,

15:42.161 --> 15:43.728
only two of the three ships

15:43.734 --> 15:46.469
that left Casablanca went to Argentina.

15:46.536 --> 15:48.991
And we assumed that's
where Steiner's group went,

15:48.997 --> 15:50.640
but maybe we were wrong.

15:50.646 --> 15:52.854
Where did the third ship go?

15:53.561 --> 15:55.806
Right here.

15:55.812 --> 15:57.103
Quebec.

15:58.515 --> 16:02.258
Look, there's a dam here
near the town of Saint-Denis.

16:02.433 --> 16:03.992
That's a good place to start if

16:03.998 --> 16:05.683
you're building a new radionics lab.

16:05.689 --> 16:07.247
The town of Saint-Denis is

16:07.253 --> 16:09.230
infamously known for one thing:

16:09.509 --> 16:11.229
An unexplained malfunction

16:11.235 --> 16:12.923
caused a blackout and a breach

16:12.929 --> 16:16.341
in the dam, flooding the town,
killing hundreds of people.

16:16.880 --> 16:20.383
And it happened on August 12, 1945.

16:20.389 --> 16:22.457
The anniversary of Cleopatra's death.

16:22.463 --> 16:23.879
Yet another coincidence.

16:23.885 --> 16:26.354
That explains why we
never found Steiner.

16:26.360 --> 16:28.830
We never knew about this ratline.

16:29.228 --> 16:30.995
We're off to Canada.

16:34.437 --> 16:36.447
You have one more hunt left in you?

16:38.255 --> 16:40.311
I wish I was young like you.

16:41.658 --> 16:43.461
But I will take great satisfaction

16:43.467 --> 16:45.864
from closing the Steiner file.

16:45.870 --> 16:47.137
We'll do our best.

16:47.431 --> 16:49.365
Thank you, Moshe.

17:00.610 --> 17:02.745
Transfer is ready.

17:02.813 --> 17:04.512
Don't make any problems for me.

17:04.580 --> 17:06.281
Enzo, you know me.

17:06.288 --> 17:07.698
I thought I did.

17:08.814 --> 17:10.348
We've had each other's backs

17:10.354 --> 17:11.686
too many times to count.

17:11.755 --> 17:13.388
Did you ever not trust me then?

17:16.594 --> 17:19.136
Am I no longer the
godfather of your son?

17:32.476 --> 17:35.178
Forgive me, my friend.

17:35.184 --> 17:38.186
Sleep well. I'm sorry.

18:05.633 --> 18:08.511
- Where are you?
- Rome. I am burned.

18:10.748 --> 18:12.047
I'm not coming in.

18:12.053 --> 18:14.031
I need new documents for travel.

18:15.519 --> 18:17.081
Track down every private jet

18:17.087 --> 18:18.649
belonging to Jacob Reece.

18:18.655 --> 18:20.211
Whichever one Lexi Vaziri is on,

18:20.217 --> 18:21.529
that is where I am going.

18:21.591 --> 18:23.993
I believe she's heading into danger.

18:56.851 --> 18:58.866
That was six days ago.

18:59.434 --> 19:03.111
Soon our Axis allies
will also admit defeat.

19:03.555 --> 19:06.790
We cannot compete with this superpower.

19:06.968 --> 19:08.535
But Truman is right.

19:08.750 --> 19:11.018
The end is not yet.

19:11.024 --> 19:13.459
Victory can still be ours.

19:13.588 --> 19:15.199
Mark this date:

19:15.384 --> 19:18.236
12 August, 1945,

19:18.760 --> 19:22.307
the 1,975th anniversary

19:22.313 --> 19:24.403
of the Egyptian queen's death,

19:24.466 --> 19:26.365
as the day we unleashed

19:26.371 --> 19:28.441
our own superweapon,

19:28.447 --> 19:30.782
Projekt Athena.

19:36.371 --> 19:40.478
Cleopatra, holy incarnation of Athena,

19:40.484 --> 19:44.554
I summon you now, to
bestow your powers upon us.

19:44.986 --> 19:47.597
May I have power over water...

19:47.806 --> 19:51.475
Air, the waters, streams,

19:51.481 --> 19:53.101
riparian lands,

19:53.107 --> 19:55.175
men who would harm me

19:55.441 --> 19:58.343
in the realm of the dead and the living,

19:58.349 --> 20:01.561
those who would order harm
done to me upon earth.

20:01.803 --> 20:04.972
May the Fourth Reich begin!

20:44.412 --> 20:46.580
Over here.

20:48.160 --> 20:50.962
Look. A plaque.

20:51.186 --> 20:54.198
It's the Saint-Denis
Dam disaster of '45.

20:55.357 --> 20:58.726
What? Thought you'd be
getting to punch old Nazis?

20:58.793 --> 21:00.380
No.

21:00.682 --> 21:03.384
Sorry, Lex, time is a cruel mistress.

21:03.390 --> 21:04.875
I mean, couldn't there just be

21:04.881 --> 21:06.762
one too-angry-to-die Nazi left

21:06.768 --> 21:08.402
for me to send to hell?

21:19.030 --> 21:20.930
Yeah, there's more.

21:27.639 --> 21:29.606
It's an anagram of ODESSA,

21:29.612 --> 21:31.425
a secret group of SS officers

21:31.431 --> 21:33.632
formed at the end of World War II

21:33.762 --> 21:36.877
who facilitated secret
Nazi escape routes.

21:38.595 --> 21:40.044
This is an old coded message

21:40.050 --> 21:41.730
signaling a Nazi safe haven.

21:41.736 --> 21:44.891
I bet the cafeteria here sells strudel.

21:44.897 --> 21:46.490
Well, I thought we like strudel.

21:46.496 --> 21:49.042
We do, but in this context,
it would be ominous.

21:49.110 --> 21:52.646
Right. Okay, let's see
what else we can find out.

22:05.929 --> 22:08.033
This entire place is off-limits!

22:08.205 --> 22:09.637
Who are you?

22:09.643 --> 22:11.103
We're just,

22:11.109 --> 22:13.143
enthusiasts, really.

22:13.301 --> 22:16.303
"We give a dam." That's our club motto.

22:16.309 --> 22:19.511
We get a handful
of you folks every year.

22:19.611 --> 22:21.730
Sorry, but this is not a museum.

22:21.736 --> 22:23.610
Dam workers only.

22:23.678 --> 22:25.612
None of them look like you, though.

22:25.680 --> 22:28.694
I'm Danny, by the way.

22:28.700 --> 22:30.317
Caroline.

22:30.385 --> 22:31.768
I'm sorry, but I'm going

22:31.774 --> 22:33.382
to have to escort you out.

22:33.388 --> 22:35.182
You sure we can't just have

22:35.188 --> 22:37.386
a little look around, Caroline?

22:38.135 --> 22:40.396
Dam rules.

22:42.076 --> 22:43.567
But there's no rule that

22:43.573 --> 22:45.276
I can't take you the long way.

22:46.096 --> 22:47.329
"We give a dam"?

22:47.335 --> 22:50.098
I know. I could barely
hold back my high five.

22:50.104 --> 22:53.139
Now go. Work your asset.

22:54.938 --> 22:57.339
So, the disaster of '45...

22:57.345 --> 22:59.813
All anybody ever
wants to talk about.

22:59.819 --> 23:01.553
It was a freak occurrence.

23:01.559 --> 23:04.561
We've had over 70 years
of a perfect record since.

23:04.567 --> 23:06.019
What caused it? Do you know?

23:06.025 --> 23:08.794
A massive power fluctuation.

23:08.923 --> 23:11.091
- From where?
- They don't know.

23:11.159 --> 23:12.993
The town wasn't that big at the time.

23:13.061 --> 23:16.029
Caroline, I'm sure a
lady such as yourself

23:16.035 --> 23:18.870
who's in the know has
probably heard some theories.

23:18.876 --> 23:22.212
Well, I heard rumors it was
from the old weather station.

23:22.218 --> 23:24.054
Some crazy stories about what used

23:24.060 --> 23:26.111
to happen out there back in the day.

23:26.174 --> 23:27.881
Old weather station.

23:27.887 --> 23:29.848
And is that close by?

23:40.337 --> 23:43.572
So those lines feed the weather station?

23:43.578 --> 23:47.394
Used to. They aren't even
connected to anything anymore.

23:47.400 --> 23:48.924
Station's still out there, though.

23:48.930 --> 23:50.864
A few miles inland.

23:56.910 --> 23:58.857
That's a lot of electricity

23:58.863 --> 24:00.751
running into a weather station.

24:04.646 --> 24:06.146
Let's take a closer look.

24:17.543 --> 24:19.677
How is this possible?

24:20.058 --> 24:21.825
I mean, this happened hours ago.

24:21.831 --> 24:23.554
Why am I finding out about this now?

24:23.560 --> 24:25.661
I'm sorry that you
were not my first call

24:25.667 --> 24:27.067
after I was assaulted.

24:27.073 --> 24:29.298
So what, now he's just
magically disappeared?

24:29.304 --> 24:32.039
Captain Fabi has betrayed us all.

24:32.106 --> 24:34.207
We will find him, Agent Karlsson.

24:39.814 --> 24:42.193
I think someone lives here.

24:43.418 --> 24:45.752
Okay, so we'll wait
for them to come back.

24:47.959 --> 24:50.727
Or just... break in.

24:50.873 --> 24:54.242
Duh. Hi. I'm Lexi.
Apparently, we've never met.

24:54.349 --> 24:56.164
Excuse me?

24:57.599 --> 25:00.738
Hi. Do... do you live here?

25:00.744 --> 25:01.758
I do.

25:01.764 --> 25:03.429
Name's Georges Larose.

25:05.494 --> 25:08.648
I can't offer you much,
but I do have tea.

25:08.922 --> 25:11.117
We're-we're fine. Thanks.

25:11.744 --> 25:14.012
So, you're writing a book about the dam?

25:14.018 --> 25:16.334
The disaster of '45, specifically.

25:16.808 --> 25:18.208
The dam failed.

25:18.432 --> 25:19.899
The town flooded.

25:19.905 --> 25:21.672
They rebuilt.

25:21.802 --> 25:23.395
Not much of a story.

25:23.401 --> 25:24.913
Well, when you say it like that...

25:24.937 --> 25:26.838
How long have you been
the caretaker here?

25:26.844 --> 25:29.312
When the government
decommissioned it in the '90s,

25:29.318 --> 25:31.566
I bought the whole
thing for a few grand.

25:31.572 --> 25:34.040
They were happy to get
rid of it, I guess.

25:34.046 --> 25:36.957
And I like the peace and quiet here.

25:36.963 --> 25:39.425
The old caretaker from
the time of the disaster

25:39.431 --> 25:41.493
left some stuff behind.

25:41.653 --> 25:43.472
There's some of his
journals are over there...

25:43.478 --> 25:45.982
- You're welcome to them.
- That'd be helpful. Thanks.

25:45.988 --> 25:49.777
Actually, I will take that
tea, if you don't mind.

25:50.717 --> 25:52.939
- I'll be right back.
- Thanks.

25:57.757 --> 25:59.158
Hey.

25:59.225 --> 26:01.060
Over here.

26:03.134 --> 26:05.578
- Is that...?
- The Black Sun.

26:05.789 --> 26:07.695
It's different
from the Nazi version

26:07.701 --> 26:09.702
we saw on Castle Schädelberg.

26:10.269 --> 26:13.004
Looks like a ceremonial sundial.

26:14.397 --> 26:16.070
It's from her tomb.

26:16.694 --> 26:19.378
When the Nazis took Cleopatra.

26:19.639 --> 26:21.907
Larose is one of them.

26:21.974 --> 26:24.009
Don't overreact.

26:24.076 --> 26:26.811
I get to send the last
Nazi to hell after all.

26:27.679 --> 26:30.647
So when I say, "Don't overreact."

26:41.761 --> 26:43.678
This isn't a museum!

26:43.757 --> 26:45.667
What is it with people today?

26:45.673 --> 26:48.161
I'm sorry, miss, I'm looking
for a couple of friends of mine.

26:48.167 --> 26:50.377
I believe they came through
here: A woman and a man.

26:50.383 --> 26:52.384
"You give a dam."

26:53.539 --> 26:55.106
Yes.

26:55.174 --> 26:57.773
Well, your friends left
without you a couple hours ago.

26:57.779 --> 26:59.706
Do you have any idea where they went?

26:59.712 --> 27:01.345
Sorry. No.

27:02.666 --> 27:04.133
Miss.

27:08.985 --> 27:11.456
You know where this man lives?

27:13.590 --> 27:16.458
Larose only brought up
the old caretaker's journals

27:16.464 --> 27:18.088
when he saw me looking at it.

27:18.094 --> 27:19.619
He was trying to distract me.

27:19.625 --> 27:20.989
Yeah, but he's still too

27:20.995 --> 27:22.567
young to be one of the Nazis

27:22.573 --> 27:23.973
who took Cleopatra.

27:23.979 --> 27:25.480
So who is he?

27:25.735 --> 27:27.670
I have a better question.

27:27.737 --> 27:28.971
Who...

27:29.039 --> 27:30.372
Are you?

28:02.222 --> 28:04.056
Where's Lexi?

28:04.062 --> 28:06.530
Is that your girlfriend's name?

28:06.536 --> 28:07.969
She's not my girlfriend.

28:09.373 --> 28:10.940
Who's the girl?!

28:11.008 --> 28:12.642
The girl's a thief.

28:12.710 --> 28:15.111
She's looking for a treasure.

28:15.179 --> 28:17.273
Cleopatra.

28:17.279 --> 28:18.500
Yeah.

28:21.919 --> 28:24.554
Cleopatra's long gone.

28:24.621 --> 28:25.988
Where?

28:28.929 --> 28:31.864
I got rid of her after my father died.

28:32.291 --> 28:35.565
He thought Cleopatra could
help him defeat the world.

28:35.741 --> 28:37.676
Complete nonsense.

28:42.198 --> 28:43.665
So...

28:43.874 --> 28:46.442
You're here to clean up loose ends

28:46.510 --> 28:48.678
for Operation Paperclip.

28:51.815 --> 28:54.617
Tell me why I shouldn't kill you.

28:56.761 --> 28:59.363
Because I called the CIA.

28:59.690 --> 29:01.824
They already know you're here.

29:03.231 --> 29:05.000
When my father wasn't wasting

29:05.006 --> 29:06.891
his time with Projekt Athena,

29:06.897 --> 29:10.328
he was monitoring Soviet communication

29:10.334 --> 29:13.270
over the Pole for the CIA.

29:13.276 --> 29:14.910
This entire area

29:15.204 --> 29:18.007
is shielded from radio
and mobile activity

29:18.075 --> 29:20.676
to keep the people from spying.

29:22.257 --> 29:24.091
If you worked for the CIA,

29:24.097 --> 29:26.064
you would know that.

29:26.656 --> 29:28.500
I ask...

29:29.045 --> 29:30.979
One more time.

29:33.736 --> 29:35.203
Who...

29:35.209 --> 29:36.609
Are...

29:36.615 --> 29:38.194
You!

29:41.870 --> 29:43.291
Come on.

29:43.818 --> 29:45.052
Come on.

29:45.058 --> 29:46.592
There you go.

29:55.057 --> 29:57.511
- Fabi.
- Stay still.

29:58.629 --> 30:00.942
The caretaker here
is a very dangerous man.

30:00.948 --> 30:03.381
Yes, we figured that out, thank you.

30:03.387 --> 30:04.821
Now, let's go save Danny.

30:13.997 --> 30:15.131
Let's go.

30:15.651 --> 30:18.719
Okay. Okay.

30:19.389 --> 30:20.968
I don't work for the CIA.

30:22.198 --> 30:25.100
I'm an international lawyer
who's hunting a terrorist.

30:25.106 --> 30:26.640
Your lies are getting worse.

30:26.646 --> 30:28.213
I'm telling the truth!

30:28.545 --> 30:30.713
Karim Farouk.

30:31.563 --> 30:33.516
He attacked the pyramids.

30:33.522 --> 30:35.675
Now he's looking for Cleopatra.

30:36.077 --> 30:39.145
We're trying to find her
first to stop his next attack.

30:39.165 --> 30:41.333
She does have some kind of power?

30:42.770 --> 30:45.093
Or bad people just come
to the same bad ideas.

30:45.099 --> 30:47.000
That's my father you're talking about.

30:47.006 --> 30:48.674
Your father's a Nazi.

30:52.450 --> 30:54.259
- Danny?
- Who are you?!

30:54.265 --> 30:56.410
Who sent you?!

30:56.416 --> 30:58.483
Lexi. Lexi.

30:58.489 --> 31:00.547
- Wait, wait.
- What are you waiting for?

31:00.553 --> 31:03.149
Listen, we go in without a
plan, we get Danny killed.

31:03.155 --> 31:04.902
He's already being killed.

31:12.163 --> 31:13.726
I thought you were dead,

31:13.732 --> 31:16.029
and I'd never get to
tell you I was right.

31:16.035 --> 31:17.536
Nobody needs to die here.

31:17.542 --> 31:19.383
Just tell us where Cleopatra is.

31:19.450 --> 31:20.944
Ask Eduardo Sanchez.

31:20.950 --> 31:23.534
- He has her, and good riddance.
- The narco?

31:23.540 --> 31:25.302
That's right. When the Cold War ended,

31:25.308 --> 31:26.865
the CIA stopped paying the bills,

31:26.871 --> 31:28.785
so I became a smuggler.

31:28.848 --> 31:31.406
Right. That's all we needed to know.

31:31.412 --> 31:32.713
Let him go.

31:32.719 --> 31:35.654
What about your partner
out there? I heard two voices.

31:35.660 --> 31:38.478
Are you gonna shoot me in
the back the moment I leave?

31:42.695 --> 31:44.352
I recognize you.

31:44.493 --> 31:46.423
I killed your partner when you

31:46.429 --> 31:47.994
were here for my father.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.435
He won't let me walk out of here alive.

31:50.503 --> 31:51.837
Fabi, tell him he can go.

31:51.843 --> 31:53.511
Doesn't matter what he says.

31:53.517 --> 31:55.885
I'm gonna take one of you for insurance.

31:56.075 --> 31:58.076
Take me. I'll go.

31:58.144 --> 31:59.745
- Lexi, stop.
- Danny, stop.

31:59.812 --> 32:02.114
- Here.
- No.

32:05.084 --> 32:07.252
- Fine. I'll take you.
- No.

32:07.461 --> 32:10.062
- Lexi.
- Let me do this.

32:12.981 --> 32:15.215
No.

32:23.264 --> 32:25.465
I'm not letting you leave here.

32:25.471 --> 32:28.208
- You shoot, she dies.
- I'll be fine.

32:28.214 --> 32:30.750
No, you won't. Trust me, Lexi.

32:30.756 --> 32:31.905
I know this man.

32:31.911 --> 32:33.844
He killed my partner.

32:34.580 --> 32:36.681
My partner was your mother,

32:36.687 --> 32:38.057
Jamila.

32:46.626 --> 32:49.060
Fabi. Fabi.

32:54.205 --> 32:56.174
I don't understand.

32:56.180 --> 32:58.043
I thought my father
was in the Brotherhood.

32:58.049 --> 32:59.482
I'm sorry.

32:59.488 --> 33:01.144
It wasn't your father,

33:01.150 --> 33:02.729
it was your mother.

33:02.735 --> 33:04.664
She died because of me.

33:04.670 --> 33:06.799
I failed your mother once.

33:06.874 --> 33:08.842
I could not fail her again.

33:09.237 --> 33:12.261
Her spirit lives on in you, Lexi.

33:13.497 --> 33:15.398
She wanted you to...

33:16.382 --> 33:17.915
To follow...

34:51.094 --> 34:52.462
What happened?

34:55.297 --> 34:57.467
They have found Captain Fabi.

34:57.473 --> 34:58.573
He's dead.

34:59.482 --> 35:00.811
How?

35:01.123 --> 35:02.203
Where?

35:02.209 --> 35:04.210
He was shot, in North America.

35:04.240 --> 35:08.276
Quebec. Anonymous tip
led the police to the scene.

35:09.278 --> 35:11.045
Can I see the report?

35:11.051 --> 35:12.652
I have been instructed to tell you

35:12.658 --> 35:15.240
that the death of Captain
Fabi is carabinieri business.

35:15.246 --> 35:16.613
We will take care of it.

35:16.619 --> 35:19.613
We're only informing Interpol
as a matter of courtesy.

36:18.347 --> 36:20.281
Chuck keeps

36:20.287 --> 36:23.662
raving about this restaurant
around the corner.

36:23.912 --> 36:25.748
Says they have the best.

36:25.754 --> 36:27.731
Cacio e Pepe in town.

36:28.748 --> 36:30.016
You want to go?

36:30.932 --> 36:32.405
Dinner's on me.

36:37.566 --> 36:40.301
My mother had this whole other life

36:40.307 --> 36:41.962
I didn't know about.

36:42.595 --> 36:44.257
She wanted me to be

36:44.263 --> 36:45.801
this whole other person.

36:46.904 --> 36:49.784
Prepared me for it since I
was born, I just never...

36:50.488 --> 36:52.298
Never realized it.

36:54.116 --> 36:57.218
She never told you anything

36:57.224 --> 36:58.981
about Serapis?

36:59.455 --> 37:01.022
My dad didn't tell me, either.

37:03.852 --> 37:06.451
Was that why he sent
me to boarding school?

37:06.457 --> 37:08.024
To keep me from it?

37:08.030 --> 37:10.192
And maybe he was right
to keep it from me.

37:10.198 --> 37:12.323
Fabi is... is dead.

37:13.068 --> 37:14.969
My mother's dead.

37:16.906 --> 37:19.007
Everyone I love dies.

37:23.524 --> 37:26.660
Everybody dies, Lex.

37:32.054 --> 37:34.539
The people closest to me

37:35.591 --> 37:37.525
die too soon.

37:45.167 --> 37:46.719
You need answers

37:47.882 --> 37:49.513
about your mom,

37:50.139 --> 37:52.273
about yourself.

37:52.911 --> 37:55.412
There's only one place
you're gonna get them.

37:57.579 --> 37:59.380
I...

38:00.516 --> 38:02.434
I took this off Fabi

38:02.440 --> 38:04.367
before we called the cops.

38:06.680 --> 38:08.432
I thought you might want

38:08.438 --> 38:10.239
to bring it back to the Brotherhood.

38:14.263 --> 38:15.596
Thank you.

38:17.818 --> 38:19.762
But what if the answers I get

38:19.768 --> 38:22.898
just make everything more complicated?

38:30.679 --> 38:34.315
Yeah, you'll be walking
uninvited into the crypt

38:34.321 --> 38:36.482
of a 2,000-year-old secret order.

38:36.488 --> 38:37.902
It's absolutely gonna make

38:37.908 --> 38:39.321
things more complicated.

38:41.457 --> 38:43.579
But whatever happens,

38:44.806 --> 38:46.798
we're gonna get through it together.

38:48.833 --> 38:50.312
I know.
