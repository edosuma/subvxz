WEBVTT

00:08.389 --> 00:09.589
OKAY, SWEETIE. OKAY, HERE WE GO.

00:09.590 --> 00:11.511
ARE YOU SURE YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING?

00:11.512 --> 00:13.343
WOULD YOU RELAX, PLEASE? I'M
GONNA GIVE YOU A QUICK JERK,

00:13.344 --> 00:15.014
AND I'M GONNA PUT YOUR
VERTEBRAE BACK INTO ALIGNMENT.

00:15.015 --> 00:16.896
OKAY, LOOK, LOOK, IT'S NOT
THAT I DON'T TRUST YOU...

00:16.897 --> 00:18.728
I WOULD NEVER SAY THAT WHILE
YOUR ARM IS AROUND MY NECK...

00:18.729 --> 00:20.310
BUT IT'S JUST THAT I
DON'T WANT TO SPEND

00:20.311 --> 00:21.851
THE REST OF MY LIFE
WITH A HELPER MONKEY.

00:21.852 --> 00:24.904
WOULD YOU RELAX, PLEASE?
YOUR NECK IS VERY TENSE.

00:24.905 --> 00:27.697
OKAY, HERE WE GO. WE'RE GONNA
DO IT ON THREE. READY?

00:27.698 --> 00:29.819
ONE, TWO...

00:29.820 --> 00:31.491
- OH, LOOK, LENNOX IS HERE!
- HEY!

00:31.492 --> 00:34.574
- OH, HURRAY!
- THIS IS NOT OVER, ALL RIGHT?

00:34.575 --> 00:37.917
- I WILL CRACK YOU. -WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HOME SO LATE, HONEY?

00:37.918 --> 00:39.659
OH, EVITA'S CLASS RAN LONG.

00:39.660 --> 00:42.332
SHE WAS DONE WITH HER LECTURE,
BUT WE WOULDN'T LET HER LEAVE.

00:42.333 --> 00:44.003
EVERYBODY JUST WANTED MORE.

00:44.004 --> 00:45.835
SHE'S SUCH A
BRILLIANT PROFESSOR.

00:45.836 --> 00:47.587
THAT REMINDS ME OF WHEN I
WAS IN BUSINESS SCHOOL.

00:47.588 --> 00:49.379
WE HAD THIS AMAZING
PROFESSOR THERE,

00:49.380 --> 00:51.381
AND ONE DAY...

00:51.382 --> 00:54.224
HE ACTUALLY GOT SICK, AND HE ASKED
ME TO TAKE OVER THE CLASS FOR HIM.

00:54.225 --> 00:57.597
AND THE OTHER STUDENTS, THEY WOULD
JUST NOT LET ME STOP TALKING.

00:57.598 --> 00:59.939
THEY WERE LIKE, "GIVE
US MORE, GIVE US MORE."

00:59.940 --> 01:01.060
SO... (chuckles)

01:01.061 --> 01:02.893
IT WAS THE SAME THING.

01:03.814 --> 01:06.606
YEAH, THAT'S DEFINITELY
THE SAME THING,

01:06.607 --> 01:08.858
EXCEPT EVITA FREEMAN IS

01:08.859 --> 01:11.030
ONE OF THE UP-AND-COMING
SOCIOLOGISTS

01:11.031 --> 01:11.992
IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY.

01:11.993 --> 01:14.364
TODAY'S LECTURE WAS GENIUS.
PRIVATE PROPERTY:

01:14.365 --> 01:15.995
AMERICA'S GREATEST EVIL.

01:15.996 --> 01:19.039
OOH, AMERICA'S GREATEST EVIL. IS HOWIE
MANDEL STILL HOSTING THAT SHOW?

01:20.291 --> 01:23.333
OKAY, I UNDERSTAND
IF YOU DON'T GET IT.

01:23.334 --> 01:25.795
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE
YOU WERE IN COLLEGE.

01:25.796 --> 01:27.877
IT'S A WORLD OF
EXCITING NEW IDEAS.

01:27.878 --> 01:29.339
YEAH, I JUST WORK
IN CITY GOVERNMENT,

01:29.340 --> 01:30.880
THE WORLD OF ACTUALLY
DOING STUFF.

01:30.881 --> 01:34.134
LADIES, LADIES, COME ON. THERE'S NO
REASON TO PICK ONE OVER THE OTHER.

01:34.135 --> 01:36.516
BOTH GOVERNMENT AND A
LIBERAL ARTS EDUCATION...

01:36.517 --> 01:37.808
DON'T ACTUALLY DO ANYTHING.

01:39.140 --> 01:40.980
AND WHY DO YOU HAVE TO TAKE
A SOCIOLOGY CLASS ANYWAY?

01:40.981 --> 01:43.983
YOU'RE A GOVERNMENT MAJOR, INSPIRED
BY YOUR DISTINGUISHED AUNT.

01:43.984 --> 01:46.486
OH NO, I DON'T HAVE TO TAKE THE CLASS.
I CHOSE TO.

01:46.487 --> 01:49.489
WELL, THOSE GOVERNMENT
CLASSES CAN BE A LITTLE DRY,

01:49.490 --> 01:51.361
BUT THEY DO HELP ME
CATCH UP ON MY SLEEP.

01:51.362 --> 01:53.863
(laughs)

01:53.864 --> 01:54.945
I WAS LAUGHING AT
SOMETHING ELSE.

01:55.906 --> 01:57.827
OKAY, WELL, ANYWAY, I'VE
GOT SO MUCH READING TO DO

01:57.828 --> 01:59.910
FOR EVITA'S CLASS. IT'S
ALL SO FASCINATING.

02:02.623 --> 02:05.955
YUP, THERE IT IS. LOOKS LIKES
LENNOX HAS FOUND HER SUPER PROF.

02:05.956 --> 02:08.248
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- YOU KNOW, AT SOME POINT

02:08.249 --> 02:09.669
IN EVERY COLLEGE STUDENT'S LIFE,

02:09.670 --> 02:11.751
THEY MEET THAT PROFESSOR
THAT BLOWS THEIR MIND.

02:11.752 --> 02:13.593
YOU KNOW, LIGHTS UP THEIR WORLD.

02:13.594 --> 02:16.676
PLEASE. SHE PROBABLY HAS A BIG
BOWL OF CANDY AT HER DESK.

02:16.677 --> 02:18.888
WAIT A MINUTE NOW. IS SOMEONE...

02:18.889 --> 02:21.561
MAYBE A LITTLE THREATENED
BY LENNOX'S PROFESSOR?

02:21.562 --> 02:23.523
MAYBE A LITTLE.

02:23.524 --> 02:24.854
BUT IT'S HARD, JOE.

02:24.855 --> 02:27.267
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO BE PUT UP ON A PEDESTAL.

02:27.268 --> 02:30.149
- YOU NEVER WANT TO COME DOWN.
- MMM. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

02:30.150 --> 02:32.862
I'M SURE THIS INFATUATION WITH
HER PROFESSOR IS ONLY TEMPORARY.

02:32.863 --> 02:36.656
IT'S REALLY AS TRADITIONAL AS FRAT GUYS
DUCT-TAPING A BUNCH OF FRESHMEN TOGETHER

02:36.657 --> 02:38.619
AND LEAVING THEM IN THE
MIDDLE OF THE QUAD.

02:39.990 --> 02:41.332
NOT THAT I EVER DID THAT.

02:42.453 --> 02:45.124
YOU'RE RIGHT, YOU'RE RIGHT. LENNOX
IS STILL A GOVERNMENT MAJOR.

02:45.125 --> 02:47.917
YOU KNOW, WE SHOULD BE
GRATEFUL THAT SHE'S NOT

02:47.918 --> 02:51.211
HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH ONE OF HER
MARRIED PROFESSORS. (laughs)

02:51.212 --> 02:53.633
NOT THAT I EVER DID THAT.

BITING IN THE LIVING ROOM.

03:22.323 --> 03:24.123
(Southern accent) LEGEND HAS
IT THERE'S AN 80-LB TROUT

03:24.124 --> 03:27.126
CALLED KING NASTY WHAT
LIVES UNDER THE STAIRS.

03:27.127 --> 03:29.289
THAT IS SO FUNNY. NO,
ALL THIS GEAR IS

03:29.290 --> 03:31.130
FOR MY FATHER-DAUGHTER
BONDING TRIP WITH DANI.

03:31.131 --> 03:33.092
WE'RE GONNA BE GOING
WHITE-WATER RAFTING

03:33.093 --> 03:34.834
CAMPING UNDERNEATH THE STARS,

03:34.835 --> 03:36.546
EATING FISH THAT WE
CAUGHT OURSELVES...

03:36.547 --> 03:38.177
(chuckles) OR...

03:38.178 --> 03:40.550
ENERGY BARS THAT WE
BOUGHT OURSELVES.

03:40.551 --> 03:42.892
THAT SOUNDS FUN. I STILL
DON'T HAVE TO GO, RIGHT?

03:42.893 --> 03:44.894
NO, HONEY, YOU
MADE IT VERY CLEAR

03:44.895 --> 03:46.846
THAT UNTIL NATURE COMES UP
WITH A QUILTED, TWO-PLY LEAF,

03:46.847 --> 03:48.808
THAT YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE
REPORTING FOR CAMPING DUTY.

03:48.809 --> 03:52.522
SEE WHAT I DID THERE WITH THE "DUTY"?
"DOO"...

03:52.523 --> 03:54.023
NO, LOOK, DON'T GET ME WRONG.

03:54.024 --> 03:56.065
I LOVE NATURE. THE
FOUR SEASONS...

03:56.066 --> 03:58.027
ESPECIALLY THE ONE IN CHICAGO.
THEY PUT THE SALTY

03:58.028 --> 03:59.779
LITTLE CARAMELS ON YOUR PILLOW.

03:59.780 --> 04:01.361
YEAH, WELL, THIS TRIP IS
ACTUALLY VERY IMPORTANT

04:01.362 --> 04:03.533
FOR MY RELATIONSHIP WITH DANI,
BECAUSE SHE'S BEEN HERE

04:03.534 --> 04:04.824
TWO MONTHS AND SHE
STILL CALLS ME "JOE."

04:04.825 --> 04:06.826
SHE HAS NOT CALLED ME
"DAD," NOT EVEN ONCE.

04:06.827 --> 04:09.369
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU JUST
ASK HER TO CALL YOU "DAD"?

04:09.370 --> 04:11.871
NO, IT DOESN'T COUNT IF
YOU HAVE TO ASK SOMEBODY.

04:11.872 --> 04:14.334
THAT'S LIKE ASKING SOMEONE
TO SAY, "I LOVE YOU,"

04:14.335 --> 04:15.375
OR ASKING SOMEONE TO TELL YOU

04:15.376 --> 04:17.006
HOW GREAT THE CHICKEN PARM
WAS YOU MADE LAST NIGHT.

04:17.007 --> 04:18.298
OH YEAH, THAT REMINDS ME,

04:18.299 --> 04:20.341
THE CHICKEN PARM LAST
NIGHT WAS DELICIOUS!

04:21.552 --> 04:22.763
YEAH, YOU SEE? THAT
WAS MEANINGLESS.

04:23.804 --> 04:25.345
MY POINT IS I'M JUST HOPING THIS

04:25.346 --> 04:27.687
WILDERNESS TRIP WILL BE THE
RIGHT SETTING FOR US TO BOND

04:27.688 --> 04:30.440
AND FOR HER TO JUST
SPONTANEOUSLY CALL ME "DAD."

04:30.441 --> 04:32.021
I CAN SEE THAT HAPPENING.

04:32.022 --> 04:34.104
"THERE'S A BEAR CHASING ME!
HELP! DAD!"

04:35.356 --> 04:36.357
FINGERS CROSSED.

04:38.399 --> 04:40.069
HEY! HONEY.

04:40.070 --> 04:41.901
MY BAROLO TRAVATO?

04:41.902 --> 04:43.783
COME ON, I WAS SAVING
THIS FOR OUR ANNIVERSARY.

04:43.784 --> 04:44.864
IF YOU'RE GONNA
DRINK, WOULD YOU JUST

04:44.865 --> 04:46.536
CHOOSE SOMETHING LESS
EXPENSIVE, PLEASE,

04:46.537 --> 04:47.827
LIKE THAT "$3 HOLLER"?

04:47.828 --> 04:50.079
OH, SO ANY TIME THERE'S AN EMPTY
BOTTLE OF WINE LAYING AROUND,

04:50.080 --> 04:51.210
YOU AUTOMATICALLY ASSUME IT'S...

04:51.211 --> 04:52.672
OKAY, FAIR ENOUGH.

04:52.673 --> 04:54.335
BUT THIS ONE WASN'T ME.

04:55.416 --> 04:57.797
W... LENNOX!

04:57.798 --> 04:59.969
I THOUGHT SHE KNEW
BETTER THAN THAT.

04:59.970 --> 05:01.921
WHAT'S UP? I'M BUSY.

05:01.922 --> 05:04.974
EVITA NEEDS ME TO READ HER
GALLEY PROOFS FOR HER NEW BOOK.

05:04.975 --> 05:07.306
IT'S CALLED THE CULTURAL
SHAME OF MONEY.

05:07.307 --> 05:09.559
YEAH, I'M GONNA WAIT FOR
THE MOVIE ON THAT ONE.

05:09.560 --> 05:12.191
LISTEN, WE HAVE A
QUESTION FOR YOU.

05:12.192 --> 05:15.355
YEAH, IF YOU'RE GONNA HAVE YOUR COLLEGE
FRIENDS OVER HERE AND DRINK OUR WINE,

05:15.356 --> 05:17.937
NEXT TIME, CAN YOU PLEASE
CHOOSE THE CHEAP STUFF?

05:17.938 --> 05:21.781
NONE OF MY FRIENDS HAVE BEEN OVER, AND
BESIDES, WE ONLY DRINK CRAFT BEER.

05:21.782 --> 05:24.864
I MEAN IF WE WERE TO DRINK
SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE

05:24.865 --> 05:26.867
WHEN WE WERE ALL
21 YEARS OF AGE.

05:27.948 --> 05:30.370
WELL, IF IT WASN'T YOU
AND IT WASN'T JOE,

05:30.371 --> 05:32.832
AND I CERTAINLY HAVEN'T BEEN
SLEEP-DRINKING AGAIN...

05:32.833 --> 05:34.584
AWESOME! IS THIS
ALL FOR OUR TRIP?

05:34.585 --> 05:36.717
OH WAIT, DID YOU REMEMBER TO GET
THE BUG REPELLENT BRACELETS?

05:40.260 --> 05:44.263
WHAT? WHY IS EVERYONE LOOKING
AT ME LIKE I DID SOMETHING?

05:44.264 --> 05:46.557
THAT'S AN INTERESTING QUESTION.

05:47.968 --> 05:49.019
DID YOU DO SOMETHING?

05:50.811 --> 05:54.734
UM, I STARTED DOING
MY MATH HOMEWORK,

05:54.735 --> 05:56.896
WHICH, COME TO THINK OF IT,

05:56.897 --> 05:59.899
I SHOULD START DOING IT AGAIN.
BYE.

05:59.900 --> 06:01.481
WAIT A MINUTE, HOLD ON.

06:01.482 --> 06:03.112
I HAVE A LITTLE MATH
QUESTION FOR YOU.

06:03.113 --> 06:04.904
A 13-YEARD-OLD GIRL

06:04.905 --> 06:07.076
SNUCK A BOTTLE OF HER
DAD'S WINE, AND DRANK IT.

06:07.077 --> 06:09.489
HOW LONG WOULD SHE BE GROUNDED?
"A," TWO WEEKS;

06:09.490 --> 06:12.912
"B," TWO MONTHS; OR "C," UNTIL
PLANET EARTH CRASHES INTO THE SUN.

06:12.913 --> 06:15.665
OH! OH! I PRETEND TO
HEAR MY PHONE RINGING,

06:15.666 --> 06:18.799
IN MY ROOM UPSTAIRS, AWAY FROM
THIS UNPLEASANT-TO-BE-IN AREA.

06:20.090 --> 06:21.422
SORRY, KID.

06:22.963 --> 06:24.925
ALL I'M LOOKING FOR IS HONESTY.
IT'S THAT SIMPLE.

06:25.926 --> 06:27.808
SO, IF I'M HONEST...

06:28.809 --> 06:31.512
- YOU'LL BE COOL ABOUT THIS?
- I'LL BE COOL AS ICE.

06:34.815 --> 06:36.687
TRUST ME, IT'S NOT YOU
SHE'S WORRIED ABOUT.

06:38.569 --> 06:41.070
LISTEN, I CANNOT GUARANTEE YOU
THE TEMPERATURE OF MY COOLNESS,

06:41.071 --> 06:43.984
BUT IF YOU LIE TO ME, I PROMISE YOU THIS...
YOU WILL FEEL THE HEAT.

06:46.657 --> 06:49.239
DANI. WHAT HAPPENED?

06:52.292 --> 06:54.664
THERE WAS A COUPLE OF POPULAR
GIRLS IN THE EIGHTH GRADE

06:54.665 --> 06:56.876
THAT WERE LOOKING FOR
A PLACE TO HANG OUT.

06:56.877 --> 06:58.207
THERE WAS NOBODY HOME THAT DAY,

06:58.208 --> 07:00.249
SO I THOUGHT I'D LET
THEM HANG OUT HERE.

07:00.250 --> 07:02.962
I DIDN'T THINK THEY WERE
GONNA DRINK YOUR WINE.

07:02.963 --> 07:05.885
- HOW MUCH DID YOU DRINK?
- NONE! NONE, I SWEAR.

07:05.886 --> 07:07.807
- IT WAS JUST THE EIGHTH GRADE GIRLS.
- WHAT ARE THEIR NAMES?

07:07.808 --> 07:10.511
- NO, NO, NO! I CAN'T TELL ON THEM!
- SHE'S GOT A POINT.

07:11.552 --> 07:12.973
NOT A GOOD ONE.

07:14.685 --> 07:17.106
I JUST WANTED TO BE,
LIKE, SEMI-POPULAR,

07:17.107 --> 07:19.358
BUT I MADE A MISTAKE, OKAY?

07:19.359 --> 07:21.821
I PROMISE VANESSA WILL
NEVER COME OVER AGAIN.

07:21.822 --> 07:24.113
VANESSA. OKAY, I'M TALKING
TO VANESSA'S PARENTS.

07:24.114 --> 07:25.775
OH, NO, NO, NO, PLEASE DON'T.

07:25.776 --> 07:27.066
I'LL BE SUCH AN OUTCAST!

07:27.067 --> 07:29.990
EVEN THE ALLERGY KIDS WON'T LET
ME HAVE LUNCH AT THEIR TABLE.

07:30.991 --> 07:32.121
LISTEN TO ME. THE
IMPORTANT THING HERE

07:32.122 --> 07:34.704
IS THAT YOU WERE JUST
HONEST WITH ME, OKAY?

07:34.705 --> 07:36.626
NOW MEL AND I NEED TO
DISCUSS YOUR CONSEQUENCES,

07:36.627 --> 07:38.999
SO HEAD UPSTAIRS AND
WORK ON YOUR HOMEWORK.

07:44.464 --> 07:46.797
YOU KNOW, I DON'T SAY
THIS VERY OFTEN, BUT...

07:48.799 --> 07:50.801
I'M PRETTY IMPRESSED
WITH MYSELF.

07:51.802 --> 07:53.093
YEAH, YOU SAY THAT ALL THE TIME.

07:54.765 --> 07:58.357
AND BY THE WAY, DANI JUST
PLAYED YOU LIKE A UKULELE.

07:58.358 --> 08:00.560
- OF COURSE SHE DRANK.
- WHAT MAKES YOU SO SURE?

08:00.561 --> 08:02.441
EVERYONE IN THIS KITCHEN
WHO WAS A 13-YEAR-OLD GIRL

08:02.442 --> 08:04.403
SURROUNDED BY PEER
PRESSURE, RAISE YOUR HAND.

08:04.404 --> 08:06.816
NO. NO, I LOOKED RIGHT
IN HER EYE, ALL RIGHT?

08:06.817 --> 08:09.198
SHE TOLD ME THE TRUTH. DANI
DIDN'T DRINK, ALL RIGHT?

08:09.199 --> 08:11.070
AND TOMORROW I'M GONNA TALK TO
THIS VANESSA GIRL'S PARENTS

08:11.071 --> 08:12.912
AND I'M GONNA TELL THEM WHAT
THEIR DAUGHTER'S BEEN DOING.

08:12.913 --> 08:14.994
SO YOU CAN TELL IF
SOMEONE'S BEING HONEST

08:14.995 --> 08:17.206
JUST BY LOOKING THEM IN THE EYE?
WOW. THAT'S SOME LIE DETECTOR.

08:17.207 --> 08:18.378
LET'S TEST IT OUT RIGHT NOW.

08:19.379 --> 08:21.922
I HAVE THE SMARTEST HUSBAND
IN THE WHOLE WORLD.

08:23.463 --> 08:25.545
SEE, NOW THAT'S AN ODD ONE,
BECAUSE YOU THINK YOU'RE LYING,

08:25.546 --> 08:27.547
BUT YOU'RE ACTUALLY
TELLING THE TRUTH.

08:27.548 --> 08:29.590
IT'S OKAY, THOUGH.
GIVE ME ANOTHER ONE.

08:37.688 --> 08:38.768
- HEY.
- HEY.

08:38.769 --> 08:40.519
SO I JUST GOT A TEXT FROM EVITA.

08:40.520 --> 08:43.022
OH, MORE BRILLIANCE FROM
YOUR BRILLIANT PROFESSOR?

08:43.023 --> 08:45.524
OH, I'M SO GLAD YOU FOUND
SOMEONE SO BRILLIANT.

08:45.525 --> 08:47.948
OH, GO LIKE THAT. YOU'VE
GOT A LITTLE SARCASM.

08:48.949 --> 08:51.490
- SORRY.
- ANYWAY,

08:51.491 --> 08:53.913
EVITA WOULD LIKE
TO INTERVIEW YOU.

08:53.914 --> 08:56.826
REALLY? SHE ACTUALLY WANTS TO INTERVIEW
SOMEBODY FROM THE REAL WORLD?

08:56.827 --> 08:59.659
YEAH, SHE KNOWS YOU'RE THIS REALLY
IMPORTANT LOCAL POLITICIAN.

08:59.660 --> 09:02.372
- SHE DOES?
- WELL, OF COURSE SHE DOES.

09:03.423 --> 09:04.755
(whispers) OF COURSE SHE DOES.

09:05.966 --> 09:07.837
BUT YEAH, SHE THINKS THAT
YOU COULD CONTRIBUTE

09:07.838 --> 09:10.009
SOME SPECIAL INSIGHT THAT WOULD
BENEFIT HER LATEST RESEARCH PAPER,

09:10.010 --> 09:13.382
IT'S SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT KIND OF
PEOPLE ARE DRAWN INTO PUBLIC SERVICE.

09:13.383 --> 09:15.935
DUH! THE BEST KIND.

09:15.936 --> 09:18.888
- SO YOU'LL MEET WITH HER?
- LET ME CHECK MY SCHEDULE.

09:18.889 --> 09:20.940
I CAN'T BE NEGLECTING
IMPORTANT GOVERNMENT BUSINESS

09:20.941 --> 09:22.852
- JUST TO TALK WITH SOME...
- OH, SHE CAN FIND SOMEONE ELSE.

09:22.853 --> 09:23.854
OH, LOOK AT THAT. I'M FREE.

09:26.066 --> 09:27.397
(chattering)

09:30.991 --> 09:34.283
- HELLO, EVERYBODY!
- SHH! SHE'S ON THE PHONE...

09:34.284 --> 09:36.285
-(whispers) WITH OPRAH. -(gasps)

09:36.286 --> 09:37.997
(whispers) TELL HER I LOVE HER.

09:37.998 --> 09:41.000
I... I DON'T NEED THE PUBLICITY.

09:41.001 --> 09:44.583
IT'S NOT ABOUT HOW MANY PEOPLE READ
MY BOOK, IT'S ABOUT WHO READS IT.

09:44.584 --> 09:46.876
(scoffs) OH, OPRAH.

09:46.877 --> 09:49.800
DON'T PLAY THE SISTER CARD.
IT'S BENEATH YOU.

09:51.051 --> 09:53.342
NO, YES, YOU'RE STILL MY FRIEND.

09:53.343 --> 09:56.386
(chuckles) NO, YOU GET A CAR.

09:57.888 --> 10:00.179
YOU MUST BE MEL BURKE.
I'M EVITA FREEMAN.

10:00.180 --> 10:01.891
- NICE TO MEET YOU.
- PLEASE, HAVE A SEAT.

10:01.892 --> 10:03.773
JUST PUT THOSE AWARDS ANYWHERE.

10:03.774 --> 10:05.855
OH YEAH, I HAVE
THE SAME PROBLEM.

10:05.856 --> 10:08.438
LENNOX ONCE GAVE ME ONE THAT
SAID, "I LOVE YOU THIS MUCH."

10:11.992 --> 10:14.153
BEFORE WE GET STARTED, DO
YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS?

10:14.154 --> 10:16.826
YEAH. HOW DO YOU KNOW OPRAH?

10:16.827 --> 10:19.949
(laughs) HOW DON'T I KNOW OPRAH?

10:19.950 --> 10:22.742
SO NICE OF YOU TO...
HELP US OUT.

10:22.743 --> 10:25.044
SHALL WE DIVE RIGHT IN?
MY TIME IS PRECIOUS.

10:25.045 --> 10:26.836
I'M SURE YOURS IS, TOO.

10:26.837 --> 10:28.838
- (polite chuckle)
- ISN'T SHE GREAT?

10:28.839 --> 10:31.801
ALL RIGHT, FIRST QUESTION:
WOULD YOU VOTE YOUR CONSCIENCE

10:31.802 --> 10:35.594
IF YOU KNEW YOUR CONSTITUENTS WERE
OVERWHELMINGLY OPPOSED TO YOUR POINT OF VIEW?

10:35.595 --> 10:38.018
WELL, THE PEOPLE ELECTED ME,
BECAUSE OF MY INTELLIGENCE...

10:40.100 --> 10:42.892
I MEAN, I SORT OF KNOW
BETTER THAN THEY DO.

10:42.893 --> 10:46.566
I'M WISER. I... I KNOW
HOW TO PLAY THE SYSTEM.

10:47.858 --> 10:49.188
NO, NOT "PLAY,"
LIKE IT'S A GAME,

10:49.189 --> 10:51.481
'CAUSE THE GOVERNMENT IS DEFINITELY
NOT A GAME. NO. NO, SIRREE.

10:52.482 --> 10:55.034
JUST THAT... WHEN YOU ELECT SOMEONE,
IT'S BECAUSE OF THEIR INTELLIGENCE,

10:55.035 --> 10:57.156
NOT BECAUSE THEY'RE SOMEONE YOU
WANT TO HAVE A BEER WITH, RIGHT?

10:57.157 --> 11:00.781
I MEAN, DO YOU WANT A BEER? 'CAUSE I
COULD REALLY USE A BEER RIGHT NOW.

11:01.912 --> 11:04.043
- HOW ABOUT WE JUST GO TO THE
NEXT QUESTION? -THANK YOU.

11:04.044 --> 11:07.496
CAN A POLITICIAN DO AN EFFECTIVE
JOB WITHOUT EVER LYING?

11:07.497 --> 11:08.789
YES.

11:11.922 --> 11:13.793
WOULD YOU CARE TO ELABORATE?

11:13.794 --> 11:15.425
NOPE.

11:16.676 --> 11:19.098
- I SUGGEST YOU ELABORATE.
- (mutters) DAMN IT.

11:19.099 --> 11:22.972
(clears throat) BECAUSE WHEN YOU
LIE, YOU BREAK THE BOND OF TRUST

11:22.973 --> 11:24.473
BETWEEN YOU AND
YOUR CONSTITUENTS.

11:24.474 --> 11:27.858
AND THAT BOND, ONCE BROKEN, CAN
NEVER BE MADE WHOLE AGAIN.

11:28.939 --> 11:30.360
NAILED IT.

11:32.402 --> 11:34.613
YOU'RE ON AN AIRPLANE WITH
YOUR POLITICAL OPPONENT.

11:34.614 --> 11:36.655
THE PLANE IS GOING DOWN.
THERE'S ONLY ONE PARACHUTE.

11:36.656 --> 11:38.868
- WHO GETS THE PARACHUTE?
- ME.

11:38.869 --> 11:40.740
WAIT. THAT WAS A JOKE.

11:40.741 --> 11:42.201
DON'T YOU WANT MY REAL ANSWER?

11:42.202 --> 11:44.083
ALL ANSWERS ARE REAL ANSWERS.

11:44.084 --> 11:46.035
THIS HAS BEEN
INCREDIBLY HELPFUL.

11:46.036 --> 11:47.917
OH. WELL, THAT WENT BY FAST.

11:47.918 --> 11:49.668
WHO KNEW I COULD TALK ABOUT
MYSELF FOR A WHOLE HOUR?

11:49.669 --> 11:50.670
I DID.

11:51.671 --> 11:53.502
YOU'VE GIVEN ME MUCH MORE
THAN I COULD'VE HOPED FOR.

11:53.503 --> 11:55.885
YOU EXCEEDED
EXPECTATIONS, MEL BURKE,

11:55.886 --> 11:58.758
- WELL, IF YOU EVER WANNA COME
DOWN TO CITY HALL... -OH GOD, NO.

11:58.759 --> 12:01.430
LOOK AT THE TIME. I'M
LATE FOR A LUNCHEON.

12:01.431 --> 12:04.103
BUT OF COURSE THEY CAN'T START
WITHOUT THE GUEST OF HONOR.

12:04.104 --> 12:07.436
- SHOW THE COUNCILWOMAN OUT FOR ME.
- SURE THING.

12:07.437 --> 12:10.900
- DON'T YOU LOVE HER? -WELL, I CAN
SEE WHY YOU'RE SO IMPRESSED.

12:10.901 --> 12:12.611
BY THE WAY, WHERE IS
THIS GONNA APPEAR?

12:12.612 --> 12:15.154
IN SOME SORT OF A REALLY SMART
JOURNAL OR QUARTERLY OR SOMETHING?

12:15.155 --> 12:16.735
OH NO, IT'S FOR HER NEXT BOOK,

12:16.736 --> 12:19.910
WHAT DRAWS THE SOCIOPATHIC,
NARCISSISTIC PERSONALITY TO POLITICS?

12:22.993 --> 12:24.244
SAW WHAT NOW?

12:25.245 --> 12:27.536
WELL, YEAH, EVITA'S TRYING
TO DETERMINE IF POLITICIANS

12:27.537 --> 12:30.830
ARE REALLY TRYING TO HELP PEOPLE OR IF
THEY'RE MERELY DELUSIONAL SOCIOPATHS

12:30.831 --> 12:32.711
FEEDING THEIR OWN GOD COMPLEXES.

12:32.712 --> 12:35.965
YOU KNOW, IT SORTA SOUNDS
LIKE SHE'S MADE UP HER MIND.

12:35.966 --> 12:39.840
- WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?
- I DON'T KNOW, THE TITLE?

12:45.725 --> 12:48.148
WELL, APPARENTLY, YOU
MARRIED A SOCIOPATH.

12:49.559 --> 12:53.482
- HUH? -NO, NO, NO, NO, A
NARCISSISTIC SOCIOPATH.

12:53.483 --> 12:55.985
EVITA IS WRITING THIS
COMPLETELY BIASED PAPER,

12:55.986 --> 12:59.819
AND MY SWEET, LITTLE NIECE IS
BLIND TO THE WHOLE EVIL SCHEME.

12:59.820 --> 13:02.952
- (sighs) -I'M SORRY, BABE. I
WASN'T PAYING ATTENTION TO YOU.

13:02.953 --> 13:04.904
I HAD A PRETTY TOUGH
AFTERNOON MYSELF.

13:04.905 --> 13:06.906
OH, I DIDN'T KNOW.

13:06.907 --> 13:09.038
- WHAT HAPPENED?
- NO, IT'S OKAY.

13:09.039 --> 13:11.251
- YOU WERE ON A ROLL. KEEP ON GOING.
- NO, NO, NO, JOE. I WANNA HEAR.

13:14.794 --> 13:17.126
- SO I GO OVER TO VANESSA'S... -WHEN
SOMEONE CALLS YOU A NARCISSIST,

13:17.127 --> 13:19.338
IT PUTS A CRIMP IN
YOUR WHOLE DAY.

13:19.339 --> 13:21.341
I'M SORRY. YOU WERE SAYING?

13:23.974 --> 13:26.425
- SO I WENT OVER TO...
- EVITA IS SO DEVIOUS!

13:26.426 --> 13:28.597
(grunts, clears throat)

13:28.598 --> 13:30.891
SORRY. GO ON.

13:34.734 --> 13:38.438
SSS...

13:39.609 --> 13:41.901
SO I GO OVER TO VANESSA'S HOUSE,

13:41.902 --> 13:45.034
AND... AND IT DIDN'T GO WELL.

13:45.035 --> 13:46.705
WELL, OF COURSE NOT, SWEETIE.

13:46.706 --> 13:48.948
NOBODY WANTS TO BE TOLD THAT THEIR
TEENAGE DAUGHTER IS DRINKING.

13:48.949 --> 13:52.501
YEAH, WELL, I TRIED TO BREAK IT
TO THEM AS GENTLY AS POSSIBLE

13:52.502 --> 13:54.213
THAT THEIR PRECIOUS
VANESSA WAS DRINKING,

13:54.214 --> 13:57.046
AND I JUST SAID, "THANK GOODNESS
MY DAUGHTER WAS SO RESPONSIBLE,"

13:57.047 --> 14:02.091
AT WHICH POINT THEY SHOWED ME A PICTURE FROM
VANESSA'S PHONE OF MY DAUGHTER DRINKING.

14:02.092 --> 14:04.513
WOW. THAT'S TERRIBLE.

14:04.514 --> 14:07.096
I MEAN, I DID NOT
SEE THAT COMING.

14:07.097 --> 14:09.848
YEAH, YOU DID. YOU TOTALLY DID.

14:09.849 --> 14:11.810
I KNOW. I WAS BEING NICE.

14:11.811 --> 14:14.393
(gasps) SEE? I'M
NOT A NARCISSIST.

14:14.394 --> 14:16.186
I'M A NICE-ISSIST.

14:22.152 --> 14:25.194
WELL, NOW THAT DANI DRANK, WE'RE NOT
GOING TO BE GOING ON THAT CAMPING TRIP,

14:25.195 --> 14:27.246
WHICH MEANS THERE GOES OUR
FATHER-DAUGHTER BONDING TIME,

14:27.247 --> 14:28.697
SO NOW SHE'S NEVER
GONNA CALL ME "DAD."

14:28.698 --> 14:30.159
DO YOU REALLY HAVE
TO CANCEL THE TRIP?

14:30.160 --> 14:32.751
OF COURSE, HONEY, THERE HAS TO
BE SOME SORT OF PUNISHMENT.

14:32.752 --> 14:34.833
ISN'T CAMPING IN THE
WOODS PUNISHMENT ENOUGH?

14:34.834 --> 14:37.046
LOOK, DANI IS A GOOD GIRL.

14:37.047 --> 14:40.000
IT'S HER SO-CALLED FRIEND
EVITA THAT THE BAD INFLUENCE.

14:41.381 --> 14:44.133
EVITA? WHAT DOES LENNOX'S PROFESSOR
HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS?

14:44.134 --> 14:47.136
I DIDN'T SAY "EVITA." WHAT, DO YOU
THINK I'M OBSESSED WITH EVITA?

14:47.137 --> 14:49.098
I SAID "EVITA." DAMN IT!

14:49.099 --> 14:50.639
I MEAN "VANESSA."

14:50.640 --> 14:53.272
THEY'RE BOTH BAD
INFLUENCES ON GOOD PEOPLE.

14:53.273 --> 14:55.894
YOU'RE MAKING WAY TOO MUCH OUT OF THIS
WHOLE THING WITH EVITA, ALL RIGHT?

14:55.895 --> 14:57.356
YOU AND LENNOX HAVE A
GREAT RELATIONSHIP,

14:57.357 --> 14:59.068
YOU JUST NEED TO FIND SOME
WAY TO REMIND HER OF THAT.

14:59.069 --> 15:02.281
- YOU GUYS SHOULD DO SOMETHING TOGETHER.
- MMM. THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

15:02.282 --> 15:03.943
YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD BE FUN?

15:03.944 --> 15:05.824
IF LENNOX AND I KILLED EVITA

15:05.825 --> 15:07.287
AND THEN DUMPED HER
BODY IN THE LAKE.

15:08.408 --> 15:10.330
OR...

15:11.992 --> 15:13.833
THANK YOU FOR SAYING "OR."

15:18.628 --> 15:20.879
OH, LENNOX, I AM SO
GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

15:20.880 --> 15:23.802
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT TRIP WE TOOK
TO DOLLYWOOD WHEN YOU WERE 16,

15:23.803 --> 15:26.755
AND YOU REMEMBER THOSE PICTURES WE GOT?
WELL, I FOUND THEM,

15:26.756 --> 15:28.097
AND I HAD THESE MADE.

15:28.098 --> 15:30.600
LOOKS, WE CAN BE T-SHIRT TWINS.

15:32.262 --> 15:34.393
OH MY GOD, I DO REMEMBER THAT.

15:34.394 --> 15:37.016
- I GOT SO SICK AFTER THAT RIDE.
- YEAH, I REMEMBER.

15:37.017 --> 15:38.817
I HELD YOUR WIG BACK
IN THE LADIES' ROOM.

15:38.818 --> 15:41.981
- GOOD TIMES.
- SO GOOD.

15:41.982 --> 15:44.153
I'M LIKE YOUR FRIEND
AND YOUR AUNT.

15:44.154 --> 15:45.655
I'M YOUR FRANT.

15:46.776 --> 15:49.828
YEAH. SO ANYWAY, I HAVE SOME
NEWS I WANNA SHARE WITH YOU.

15:49.829 --> 15:52.411
IT'S REALLY BIG NEWS, AND
IT COMES IN THREE PARTS.

15:52.412 --> 15:53.413
OOH! LIKE A LITTLE PLAY!

15:54.995 --> 15:57.576
OKAY, SO I KNOW YOU THINK
I'M TOO IMPRESSIONABLE,

15:57.577 --> 15:59.918
BUT I THOUGHT A LOT ABOUT THIS,
AND THAT'S WHY I'M DOING IT.

15:59.919 --> 16:03.922
- DOING WHAT? -I'M CHANGING MY MAJOR
FROM GOVERNMENT TO SOCIOLOGY.

16:03.923 --> 16:06.715
OH. OH!

16:06.716 --> 16:09.638
SOCIOLOGY. YOU MEAN LIKE...

16:09.639 --> 16:11.011
(strains) EVITA?

16:12.592 --> 16:15.724
YEAH, EXACTLY. THAT WAY SHE
CAN BE MY ACADEMIC ADVISOR.

16:15.725 --> 16:17.096
OH YEAH, SHE CAN DO THAT, TOO.

16:17.097 --> 16:19.729
SHE'S JUST SO GREAT, THAT EVITA.

16:21.061 --> 16:24.233
- ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE NOT UPSET?
- NO. WHY WOULD I BE UPSET?

16:24.234 --> 16:27.276
I MEAN, THAT IS A PERFECTLY
LEGITIMATE NON-GOVERNMENT MAJOR,

16:27.277 --> 16:31.740
SOCIOLOGY. I MEAN, THAT IS YOUR GO-TO
OCCUPATION IN A TOUGH ECONOMY.

16:31.741 --> 16:34.993
WELL, HERE'S THE
LAST AND BEST PART.

16:34.994 --> 16:37.786
NEXT SEMESTER, EVITA IS
TRAVELING TO COLOMBIA

16:37.787 --> 16:39.038
TO DO SOME RESEARCH
ON HER THESIS

16:39.039 --> 16:41.830
ABOUT THE STABILIZING BENEFITS
OF THE NARCO-GOVERNMENT.

16:41.831 --> 16:45.924
HOLD ON. SHE'S SIDING
WITH THE DRUG LORDS?

16:45.925 --> 16:48.547
OKAY, WELL, TO BE FAIR,

16:48.548 --> 16:52.302
THEY PROVIDE BETTER SERVICES FOR THE CITIZENS
THAN THEIR ELECTED OFFICIALS EVER HAVE.

16:53.303 --> 16:55.684
WELL, GOOD LUCK TO HER.
I TRULY BELIEVE

16:55.685 --> 16:58.937
HANGING OUT IN THE JUNGLE WITH THE DRUG
LORDS IS THE RIGHT PLACE FOR EVITA.

16:58.938 --> 17:01.900
YEAH, BUT THAT'S
NOT THE BIG NEWS.

17:01.901 --> 17:03.852
THE BIG NEWS IS...

17:03.853 --> 17:05.235
I'M GOING WITH HER.

17:06.646 --> 17:08.738
TO THE DRUG LORD JUNGLE?

17:09.859 --> 17:11.820
YEAH, SHE'S TAKING
ME AS HER ASSISTANT.

17:11.821 --> 17:15.954
- SHE'S TAKING YOU TO DIE! -OKAY,
AUNT MEL, DON'T OVERREACT.

17:15.955 --> 17:17.916
WE SHOULDN'T ASSUME THAT
THEY'RE ALL BAD PEOPLE

17:17.917 --> 17:19.999
JUST BECAUSE THEY SELL
ILLEGAL NARCOTICS.

17:21.211 --> 17:23.252
YOU'RE RIGHT, YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'M SURE THEY CALL

17:23.253 --> 17:25.755
THEIR MOTHERS ON THEIR BIRTHDAY
RIGHT BEFORE THEY GO MURDER PEOPLE!

17:26.876 --> 17:28.046
EVITA SAID YOU'D REACT THIS WAY.

17:28.047 --> 17:31.471
THIS IS A CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF THE
PATRIARCHAL, ANGLO-CENTRIC XENOPHOBIA.

17:32.552 --> 17:33.843
DON'T TALK DOWN TO ME.

17:34.884 --> 17:36.766
I KNOW WHAT MOST OF
THOSE WORDS MEAN!

17:38.978 --> 17:41.480
- HEY.
- HEY THERE!

17:41.481 --> 17:43.232
- (door closes)
- PERFECT TIMING.

17:43.233 --> 17:46.355
GUESS WHAT I JUST MADE... YOUR
FAVORITE SNACK, MY FAMOUS GUACAMOLE.

17:46.356 --> 17:48.818
ACTUALLY, MY FAVORITE
SNACK IS FRENCH FRIES.

17:50.150 --> 17:51.821
I MADE GUACAMOLE.

17:52.822 --> 17:55.114
SIT DOWN. (sighs)

17:55.115 --> 17:58.037
YOU KNOW, HONEY, I SPOKE TO
VANESSA'S PARENTS THIS AFTERNOON.

17:59.909 --> 18:01.000
UH-HUH.

18:02.081 --> 18:04.833
YEAH, YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW
UPSET HER PARENTS WERE

18:04.834 --> 18:07.005
BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT THEY
COULD TRUST THEIR DAUGHTER,

18:07.006 --> 18:09.418
AND WHEN THEY FOUND OUT THEY COULDN'T,
THEIR HEARTS WERE JUST BROKEN.

18:09.419 --> 18:11.840
YEAH, THAT'S REALLY SAD.

18:11.841 --> 18:14.133
YEAH. YEAH. SO
THERE'S NOTHING ELSE

18:14.134 --> 18:16.054
YOU WANNA TELL ME ABOUT WHAT
HAPPENED THAT AFTERNOON?

18:16.055 --> 18:17.347
LET ME THINK.

18:18.348 --> 18:20.929
- NOPE.
- GOOD, GOOD. ALL RIGHT.

18:20.930 --> 18:23.312
WELL, NOW THAT WE'VE GOT THIS
WHOLE SITUATION BEHIND US,

18:23.313 --> 18:25.484
WE CAN NOW GO ON THAT
FATHER-DAUGHTER CAMPING TRIP

18:25.485 --> 18:27.146
WE'VE BEEN SO
LOOKING FORWARD TO.

18:27.147 --> 18:28.608
GREAT.

18:29.609 --> 18:32.441
YOU KNOW, I'M REALLY NOT
THAT HUNGRY ANYMORE.

18:32.442 --> 18:35.574
OH. ALL RIGHT. YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU KNOW WHAT, HONEY?

18:35.575 --> 18:36.826
I JUST HAVE TO TELL
YOU SOMETHING.

18:38.698 --> 18:41.200
I'M JUST SO HAPPY THAT WE
HAVE THIS HONESTY BETWEEN US.

18:41.201 --> 18:43.702
THINK ABOUT THIS. FOR
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE,

18:43.703 --> 18:45.374
YOU ARE GONNA KNOW YOU
WERE HONEST WITH ME.

18:45.375 --> 18:46.705
AND FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE,

18:46.706 --> 18:49.838
I'M GONNA KNOW THAT I CAN TRUST YOU.
AND THAT'S...

18:49.839 --> 18:51.300
THAT IS SOMETHING
TO BE PROUD OF.

18:51.301 --> 18:54.384
I MEAN, AREN'T YOU PROUD?

18:57.217 --> 18:58.967
(hesitantly) UH-HUH.

18:58.968 --> 19:00.969
WELL, I DIDN'T MEAN TO KEEP YOU.

19:00.970 --> 19:02.811
GO UP THERE AND
DO YOUR HOMEWORK.

19:02.812 --> 19:04.224
(chuckles)

19:05.225 --> 19:06.766
I LOVE YOU, SWEETIE.

19:11.731 --> 19:13.482
ALL RIGHT, I DRANK!

19:13.483 --> 19:15.694
I LIED! WHY CAN'T
YOU JUST ACCUSE ME

19:15.695 --> 19:18.367
LIKE A NORMAL PARENT INSTEAD
OF MESSING WITH MY HEAD?

19:18.368 --> 19:21.870
- HOW DID YOU LET THIS HAPPEN? -EVERYONE
WAS DOING IT, SO I DID IT TOO.

19:21.871 --> 19:24.283
I KNOW IT'S THE STUPIDEST
REASON IN THE WORLD TO EVER...

19:24.284 --> 19:26.746
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA! BACK UP.
DON'T YOU TAKE MY LINES.

19:27.877 --> 19:30.629
THAT IS THE STUPIDEST REASON IN THE
WHOLE WORLD TO EVER DO ANYTHING!

19:30.630 --> 19:33.422
OKAY, I GET IT. CAN
WE JUST MOVE PAST IT

19:33.423 --> 19:35.173
AND NOT TALK ABOUT IT
ON OUR RAFTING TRIP?

19:35.174 --> 19:36.675
YEAH, YEAH, WE CAN MOVE PAST IT.

19:36.676 --> 19:38.637
YOU KNOW WHY? WE'RE NOT
GOING ON THAT RAFTING TRIP.

19:38.638 --> 19:39.888
BUT... BUT THAT WAS
OUR SPECIAL TRIP,

19:39.889 --> 19:41.800
WHERE YOU SAID WE WERE GONNA
GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER BETTER.

19:41.801 --> 19:43.682
YEAH, WELL, YOU'RE
GETTING-TO-KNOW-ME EXPERIENCE

19:43.683 --> 19:45.013
IS GONNA BE LEARNING
THAT WHEN YOU LIE TO ME

19:45.014 --> 19:46.645
AND YOU DRINK, YOU GET PUNISHED.

19:46.646 --> 19:48.767
GET TO KNOW ME.

19:48.768 --> 19:50.359
BUT I TOLD YOU THE TRUTH.

19:50.360 --> 19:51.810
EVENTUALLY. EVENTUALLY YOU DID,

19:51.811 --> 19:53.862
AND YOU KNOW WHAT? EVENTUALLY WE
WILL GO ON THAT CAMPING TRIP,

19:53.863 --> 19:55.864
BUT NOT RIGHT NOW. YOU KNOW WHAT
WE'RE GONNA DO THIS WEEKEND?

19:55.865 --> 19:58.657
YOU AND ME, WE'RE GOING UPSTAIRS, AND
WE'RE GONNA CLEAN OUT THE ATTIC.

19:58.658 --> 20:00.529
I HOPE YOU LIKE RATS.

20:00.530 --> 20:03.162
OH MY GOD, DAD,
YOU'RE SO UNFAIR!

20:06.286 --> 20:09.167
YOU WON'T BELIEVE THIS. LENNOX IS
SHIPPING OFF WITH HER INSANE PROFESSOR

20:09.168 --> 20:11.291
TO THE JUNGLES OF COLOMBIA.

20:14.674 --> 20:16.636
DANI JUST CALLED ME "DAD."

20:21.261 --> 20:22.971
HOLY CRAP. THIS IS TERRIBLE!

20:22.972 --> 20:25.605
COLOMBIA IS LIKE A CRACK HOUSE
WITH A NATIONAL ANTHEM!

20:26.806 --> 20:29.938
WILL YOU STOP GOOGLING? YOU'RE ONLY
GONNA FIND NEGATIVE STUFF OUT THERE!

20:29.939 --> 20:31.650
THAT'S NOT TRUE. I
ALSO LEARNED COLOMBIA

20:31.651 --> 20:33.852
IS THE BIRTHPLACE OF
GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUEZ,

20:33.853 --> 20:36.945
AND IT HAS A THRIVING ROLLERSKATING
COMMUNITY. SO THERE.

20:36.946 --> 20:40.238
OOH! OH WAIT, THIS COULD
SOLVE EVERYTHING.

20:40.239 --> 20:42.160
HERE'S A NEWS STORY ABOUT
AN AMERICAN TOURIST

20:42.161 --> 20:44.823
WHO GOT ARRESTED IN MEDELLIN
FOR WEARING KHAKI PANTS.

20:44.824 --> 20:47.786
BECAUSE KHAKI IS THE OFFICIAL
ACTIVEWEAR OF THE CARTEL GOONS.

20:47.787 --> 20:49.077
WHEN LENNOX FINDS OUT

20:49.078 --> 20:50.289
THERE'S A DRESS
CODE IN COLOMBIA,

20:50.290 --> 20:51.330
SHE WON'T WANNA GO THERE.

20:51.331 --> 20:52.371
I'M NOT SO SURE ABOUT THAT.

20:52.372 --> 20:54.132
REMEMBER IN HIGH SCHOOL WHEN
THEY HAD THAT DRESS CODE

20:54.133 --> 20:55.173
AND OUTLAWED THE CROP TOPS?

20:55.174 --> 20:56.835
SHE WORE ONE EVERY DAY
IN THE MIDDLE OF JANUARY

20:56.836 --> 20:58.927
IN PROTEST. HER
BELLYBUTTON TURNED BLUE.

20:58.928 --> 21:00.759
NOW, THAT... THAT
DRESS CODE THING

21:00.760 --> 21:02.221
MIGHT ACTUALLY MAKE HER
WANT TO GO EVEN MORE.

21:03.643 --> 21:05.685
YOU COULDN'T LET ME HAVE
FALSE HOPE FOR TWO MINUTES?

21:06.886 --> 21:09.849
OH, HONEY. MMM.

21:10.850 --> 21:12.441
(cracks) YEAH!

21:12.442 --> 21:15.023
- GOT YOU! (chuckles)
- MY NECK!

21:15.024 --> 21:16.816
- MY NECK! (sobs)
- OH MY GOD, ARE YOU OKAY?

21:17.987 --> 21:19.198
GOTCHA!
