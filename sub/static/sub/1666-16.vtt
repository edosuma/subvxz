00:00.427 --> 00:02.028
Previously on "The Originals"...

00:02.130 --> 00:04.963
This town was my home once. I want it back.

00:05.150 --> 00:06.783
Genevieve: Drink.

00:06.785 --> 00:08.118
It's the only way I can show
you what you need to see.

00:08.119 --> 00:09.252
Rebekah: There's only ever been one man

00:09.254 --> 00:10.487
Klaus has truly feared... my father, Mikael.

00:10.489 --> 00:11.821
We'd like you to find Mikael.

00:11.823 --> 00:12.856
Of course.

00:12.858 --> 00:14.257
You needed to see it,

00:14.259 --> 00:18.194
and now you can take your revenge.

00:20.965 --> 00:22.532
Yaagh! Go.

00:22.619 --> 00:24.119
Run as far and as fast as you can.

00:24.121 --> 00:27.055
I'm afraid you're trapped.

00:27.057 --> 00:28.456
Boundary spell.

00:28.458 --> 00:30.558
The Originals can enter,
but they can't leave.

00:30.560 --> 00:34.295
Rebekah! Cherish the breath in your lungs!

00:34.297 --> 00:36.331
It'll be your last.

[Whimpers]

00:55.651 --> 00:58.986
Hush now. It's just a storm.

00:59.038 --> 01:03.374
Don't be afraid. I won't let it hurt you.

01:06.578 --> 01:08.646
Nik, don't go.

01:16.655 --> 01:20.157
I carved it for father.

01:20.159 --> 01:22.727
It's a brave knight.

01:22.729 --> 01:26.697
Now you can be brave, too.

01:28.133 --> 01:30.901
Will you stay with me till the storm ends?

01:34.806 --> 01:37.608
I will always stay with you, Rebekah,

01:37.610 --> 01:39.910
no matter what.

01:45.450 --> 01:47.685
Klaus: Rebekah!

01:49.487 --> 01:52.222
- Walk away.
- Don't move!

01:52.224 --> 01:53.590
Leave us now.

01:53.592 --> 01:55.893
I can't. I'm stuck here.

01:57.762 --> 02:00.364
Elijah, he has a white oak stick.

02:00.366 --> 02:02.499
I brought it for you, sister.

02:02.501 --> 02:03.834
Elijah: Get out of his sight.

02:03.836 --> 02:05.969
Your presence here only
serves to anger him.

02:05.971 --> 02:08.538
Leave him to me now.

02:13.912 --> 02:18.215
I'm asking you brother to brother,

02:18.217 --> 02:20.684
we end this nonsense now.

02:20.686 --> 02:22.419
You would side with that traitor?

02:22.421 --> 02:24.655
I am not choosing sides,
but I will not allow you

02:24.657 --> 02:26.957
to hurt our sister.

02:29.060 --> 02:32.696
We cannot leave this cemetery, Elijah.

02:32.698 --> 02:36.066
How long do you think you can defend her?

02:39.903 --> 02:41.671
As long as it takes...

02:43.541 --> 02:46.510
by whatever means necessary.

[Door closes]

02:53.151 --> 02:55.285
Do whatever it takes. Just stay alive.

02:55.287 --> 02:56.953
I promise you, I'll get you out of there.

02:56.955 --> 02:58.622
I've never seen him like this before.

02:58.624 --> 03:00.056
He's out of his mind with rage,

03:00.058 --> 03:01.758
up all night howling one
obscenity-laced tirade

03:01.760 --> 03:03.660
after the next.

03:03.662 --> 03:05.762
He's gonna kill me.

03:05.764 --> 03:07.630
All right. Stay as far
away from him as you can.

03:07.632 --> 03:08.965
That's a brilliant strategy,

03:08.967 --> 03:10.333
but, given that that dead bitch Celeste

03:10.335 --> 03:12.569
has trapped us in here till moonrise,

03:12.571 --> 03:13.970
my options are somewhat limited.

03:13.972 --> 03:15.472
I'm not leaving you in there.

03:15.474 --> 03:17.474
Davina will find a
loophole, get you out early.

03:17.476 --> 03:18.842
Then we can all go together.

03:18.844 --> 03:20.076
If Klaus comes after us,

03:20.078 --> 03:21.744
we will take him on one hell of a ride.

03:21.746 --> 03:23.947
I lived for centuries
looking over my shoulder,

03:23.949 --> 03:26.282
ready to run at a moment's notice.

03:26.284 --> 03:27.850
Am I to go back to that?

03:27.852 --> 03:29.152
Worry about that later.

03:29.154 --> 03:30.787
Right now, just buy me some time.

03:30.789 --> 03:32.522
I promise you, I'll get you out of there.

03:32.524 --> 03:34.657
[Beep]

03:36.126 --> 03:39.028
Hey, D., how you feel?

03:39.080 --> 03:41.080
Got you some stuff...

03:41.082 --> 03:43.683
organic soap and scented candles,

03:43.685 --> 03:47.420
some incense.

03:47.422 --> 03:48.955
Just trying to help
you get back to feeling,

03:48.957 --> 03:51.924
you know, yourself.

03:58.842 --> 04:02.344
Word on the street is, the
witches are celebrating.

04:02.346 --> 04:04.046
3 out of the 4 girls
sacrificed in the harvest

04:04.048 --> 04:05.614
have come back.

04:05.616 --> 04:07.182
First, it was your friend Monique

04:07.184 --> 04:10.085
and then another girl, now you.

04:10.087 --> 04:11.954
What I hear, the others are
saying that the ancestors

04:11.956 --> 04:14.389
were with them while they were...

04:14.391 --> 04:16.024
dead, you know,

04:16.026 --> 04:17.759
talking to them, teaching them.

04:17.761 --> 04:19.728
They say they're stronger than ever.

04:21.764 --> 04:24.099
Was it like that for you?

04:24.101 --> 04:27.002
No.

04:27.004 --> 04:29.237
There was nothing.

04:29.239 --> 04:32.441
It was cold, empty, and dark,

04:32.443 --> 04:34.910
and it went on forever.

04:39.415 --> 04:40.996
I'm sorry, D.

04:40.998 --> 04:43.231
I don't want to talk about it.

04:43.233 --> 04:47.569
Please, Marcel, don't make me.

04:49.672 --> 04:52.174
Elijah: You've been at this for hours...

04:52.176 --> 04:53.775
to what end?

04:53.777 --> 04:56.912
Niklaus, I know you, and
I grew up fighting you.

04:56.939 --> 04:59.406
I can't be beaten, nor can I be persuaded.

04:59.408 --> 05:01.641
You cannot get past me.

05:01.643 --> 05:03.376
Klaus: I could get past you,

05:03.378 --> 05:04.611
although it might have to be

05:04.613 --> 05:06.479
over your dead body.

05:06.481 --> 05:08.048
You did stab me with that blade,

05:08.050 --> 05:09.416
forcing me to endure hours

05:09.418 --> 05:11.384
of unspeakable pain.

05:11.386 --> 05:15.989
Perhaps I should direct my rage toward you.

05:15.991 --> 05:17.791
You should see yourself...

05:17.793 --> 05:21.294
the murderous expression,
the self-righteous posturing.

05:21.296 --> 05:24.164
You look like father.

05:27.168 --> 05:29.202
I'm not him.

05:29.604 --> 05:32.005
Rebekah's betrayal justifies my anger.

05:32.007 --> 05:33.907
His was that of a madman.

05:33.909 --> 05:36.509
You were never the
recipient of his cruelty.

05:36.511 --> 05:38.545
None of you were... not Kol, not Finn,

05:38.547 --> 05:39.846
none of you!

05:42.016 --> 05:45.485
I think you've forgotten
what he was truly like.

05:45.487 --> 05:47.387
No.

05:47.389 --> 05:50.356
I have not forgotten.

05:52.493 --> 05:54.027
Be still.

05:54.029 --> 05:56.329
Deep breath.

05:56.331 --> 05:58.564
Hold. Now.

06:01.602 --> 06:03.569
Your aim is improving.

06:03.571 --> 06:05.605
Next time.

06:05.607 --> 06:08.040
Mikael: You encourage him, Elijah,

06:08.042 --> 06:11.244
but he grows more pathetic every day.

06:11.246 --> 06:12.278
I'm not pathetic.

06:12.280 --> 06:14.714
Do not talk back to me.

06:14.716 --> 06:16.622
Not man enough to hold this weapon.

06:16.628 --> 06:17.894
If you can't hunt,

06:17.896 --> 06:19.296
you're nothing but a burden.

06:19.298 --> 06:20.430
I'm sorry.

06:20.432 --> 06:21.998
It's a shame we can't feed

06:22.000 --> 06:23.466
on sad-eyed apologies.

06:23.468 --> 06:25.235
It's your one and only skill.

06:25.237 --> 06:26.736
Elijah: Father, stop.

06:26.738 --> 06:29.839
Stay back, or you'll be next.

06:29.841 --> 06:31.775
The boy needs to be made strong.

06:31.777 --> 06:33.877

Niklaus, I understand your anger,

06:51.630 --> 06:54.163
but, I implore you, be better than him.

06:54.165 --> 06:56.232
Do what he could not.

06:58.369 --> 07:00.003
Demonstrate the grace of mercy

07:00.005 --> 07:01.671
rather than this petty cruelty.

07:01.673 --> 07:04.574
You ask me to show mercy
to one who has wronged me.

07:06.210 --> 07:09.712
You really don't know me
at all, do you, brother?

07:09.714 --> 07:12.148
Rebekah: Enough.

07:12.150 --> 07:14.217
Whatever I have done wrong,

07:14.219 --> 07:18.187
my guilt is nothing compared to yours.

07:18.189 --> 07:20.223
You want revenge?

07:20.225 --> 07:22.358
Fine, but before you have it,

07:22.360 --> 07:23.626
I will look you in the eye and tell you

07:23.628 --> 07:27.530
why it was your cruelty and your spite

07:27.532 --> 07:30.266
that led us to this.

07:30.268 --> 07:32.501
Go on, then.

07:32.503 --> 07:34.537
Speak your piece,

07:34.539 --> 07:36.672
and when you are finished, I will grant you

07:36.674 --> 07:40.009
the punishment you deserve,

07:40.011 --> 07:43.212
even if I have to go
through Elijah to do so.

07:57.430 --> 07:59.298
Davina...

08:08.109 --> 08:10.718
Marcel told me you were up here.

08:11.144 --> 08:13.612
Do you want to tell me what happened?

08:15.882 --> 08:19.317
I died...

08:19.319 --> 08:22.421
And at first, I was alone,

08:22.423 --> 08:25.824
but then I heard them,

08:25.826 --> 08:28.894
voices whispering to me.

08:28.896 --> 08:32.731
- Who?
- The ancestors.

08:32.732 --> 08:36.534
They're so angry with me.

08:36.537 --> 08:39.270
I used my power against my own,

08:39.273 --> 08:43.073
and they said they'd
do horrible things to me

08:43.076 --> 08:45.377
if I misuse my magic again.

08:46.629 --> 08:50.165
Kieran: So a century
ago, you betrayed Klaus,

08:50.167 --> 08:52.200
the most dangerous vampire in history,

08:52.202 --> 08:53.835
and the only one that can save you

08:53.837 --> 08:57.072
is the girl that you had
locked up in my attic,

08:57.074 --> 08:58.907
but she's a basket case.

08:58.909 --> 09:00.508
So really, your only hope

09:00.510 --> 09:02.477
is my niece, psychoanalyst

09:02.479 --> 09:04.312
to resurrected teen witches.

09:04.314 --> 09:05.914
Does that about sum it up?

09:05.916 --> 09:09.050
You're pretty smug for
a guy with a witch's hex.

09:09.052 --> 09:11.686
Davina's magic is you only shot at a cure.

09:13.756 --> 09:16.391
Let's not dance around the obvious.

09:16.393 --> 09:19.027
This hex is going to be the end of me.

09:19.029 --> 09:21.062
Every spell has a loophole.

09:21.064 --> 09:23.464
You, of all people, should have more faith.

09:25.567 --> 09:28.736
I lost my faith when Sean died.

09:29.938 --> 09:33.107
When I came back to New Orleans,

09:33.109 --> 09:35.076
I had nothing but hope of preventing a war

09:35.078 --> 09:36.944
between the vampires and the witches,

09:36.946 --> 09:38.613
and now the witches are out of control,

09:38.615 --> 09:41.415
and you allowed an Original vampire

09:41.417 --> 09:44.619
to take control of the quarter.

09:44.621 --> 09:47.388
No. There is no hope...

09:47.390 --> 09:48.856
not for you, not for the city,

09:48.858 --> 09:51.058
and certainly not for me.

09:51.060 --> 09:52.660
I get Davina back, she will find a way

09:52.662 --> 09:54.562
- to take down Klaus.
- No.

09:54.564 --> 09:57.098
He's going to get out of
this trap that he's in,

09:57.100 --> 09:59.533
and when he does, he's going to find you,

09:59.535 --> 10:02.169
and he is going to tear you into pieces.

10:03.972 --> 10:07.274
You reap what you sow, Marcel.

10:07.276 --> 10:09.076
Klaus: Let it begin...

10:09.078 --> 10:12.613
the trial of Rebekah Mikaelson.

10:12.615 --> 10:15.316
What a relief. His ego is in check.

10:15.318 --> 10:17.818
Just speak your truth.

10:17.820 --> 10:20.588
I'll make certain he behaves himself.

10:20.590 --> 10:22.690
You stand accused of
betraying your own blood.

10:22.692 --> 10:25.059
How do you plead?

10:25.061 --> 10:27.494
I plead you to shut up and listen.

10:27.496 --> 10:30.130
You summoned our father.
You brought him to our home.

10:30.132 --> 10:32.266
What possible defense could you have?

10:32.268 --> 10:33.968
I knew he was the only
thing that you feared,

10:33.970 --> 10:35.636
and I wanted you to run.

10:35.638 --> 10:36.937
Because you hated me.

10:36.939 --> 10:38.138
Because you were hateful.

10:38.140 --> 10:39.807
You denied me the freedom to love.

10:39.809 --> 10:42.576
Oh, so that's your defense?

10:42.578 --> 10:45.512
You called Mikael... the destroyer,

10:45.514 --> 10:47.948
the hunter of vampires...
because I detained you

10:47.950 --> 10:50.184
from pursuing some dull suitors.

10:50.186 --> 10:51.785
You were cruel

10:51.787 --> 10:53.820
and controlling and manipulative.

10:53.822 --> 10:56.423
I was trying to protect you

10:56.425 --> 10:59.359
from imbeciles and leeches,

10:59.361 --> 11:01.628
not to mention your own poor judgment.

11:01.630 --> 11:02.963
And what about the one

11:02.965 --> 11:05.165
that you loved enough to call friend?

11:05.167 --> 11:07.367
Why did you forbid me to love Marcel?

11:07.369 --> 11:10.203
Do not mention his name.

11:10.205 --> 11:13.540
What has happened to you?

11:13.542 --> 11:16.543
I remember the sweet boy who made me laugh

11:16.545 --> 11:19.846
and gave me gifts,

11:19.848 --> 11:23.650
who loved art and music.

11:23.652 --> 11:26.186
I wanted to be just like you.

11:28.389 --> 11:31.057
How could you have fallen so far?

11:34.061 --> 11:37.497
You say you despise Rebekah

11:37.499 --> 11:39.232
for her betrayal,

11:39.234 --> 11:42.502
and yet no one has stood by your side

11:42.504 --> 11:45.205
for so long, not even I myself.

11:45.207 --> 11:48.308
Perhaps it's you that's forgotten.

11:48.310 --> 11:49.976
I remember the day that father

11:49.978 --> 11:51.745
caught you whittling little chess pieces

11:51.747 --> 11:54.047
with his hunting knife.

11:54.049 --> 11:58.585
He beat you so mercilessly and for so long,

11:58.587 --> 12:00.753
I actually feared for your life.

12:00.755 --> 12:02.355
- Aah!
- Father!

12:02.357 --> 12:04.858
- Please.
- Stay back.

12:04.860 --> 12:07.894
- No.
- Stop it. Stop it.

12:09.330 --> 12:13.766
I will not let you hurt him anymore.

12:13.768 --> 12:18.137
You stand against me

12:18.139 --> 12:19.772
for him?

12:32.586 --> 12:37.290
So you would paint her as a loyal sister,

12:37.292 --> 12:41.460
but she betrayed me out of lust for Marcel.

12:41.462 --> 12:44.330
Perhaps that was why you did it...

12:44.332 --> 12:46.365
for love.

12:46.367 --> 12:48.200
Perhaps I might temper my rage

12:48.202 --> 12:49.635
if Rebekah will admit she was a victim

12:49.637 --> 12:52.705
of her own idiocy, that
her great love Marcel

12:52.707 --> 12:56.909
used her to oust this
family and to take my city.

12:56.911 --> 12:59.745
Marcel did not manipulate me.

13:01.415 --> 13:04.116
You defend him, and yet you can't help

13:04.118 --> 13:07.286
but wonder, what if I'm right?

13:07.288 --> 13:09.455
We loved each other.

13:09.457 --> 13:11.357
It was your refusal to respect that

13:11.359 --> 13:12.758
that led to your ruin.

13:12.760 --> 13:14.393
Then why didn't he chase after you

13:14.395 --> 13:16.328
when you fled New Orleans?

13:16.330 --> 13:17.930
Oh, yes. That's right.

13:17.932 --> 13:20.299
He was here stealing what I built.

13:20.301 --> 13:22.668
You want me to renounce Marcel,

13:22.670 --> 13:27.006
to beg for your forgiveness?

13:27.008 --> 13:28.607
I won't.

13:28.609 --> 13:31.777
Marcel is not at fault. I called Mikael.

13:31.779 --> 13:33.612
Elijah: Rebekah, you must...

13:33.614 --> 13:35.347
I was the one who
brought him to New Orleans

13:35.349 --> 13:38.517
because of your wickedness.

13:38.519 --> 13:40.419
I wanted love and happiness,

13:40.421 --> 13:42.855
and denied me the freedom to have either.

13:42.857 --> 13:47.092
Yes. I hated and I was
afraid of our father,

13:47.094 --> 13:49.661
but he was a lesser evil than you,

13:49.663 --> 13:52.130
my bastard brother who loomed over me,

13:52.132 --> 13:54.199
threatening me as you are now.

13:54.201 --> 13:56.668
I wanted rid of you,

13:56.670 --> 14:01.239
and given the choice, I'd do it again.

14:01.241 --> 14:03.308
Yaah!

14:03.310 --> 14:04.810
Uh!

14:13.085 --> 14:15.153
Sister, leave us.

14:15.155 --> 14:16.188
I won't go.

14:16.190 --> 14:18.356
I said, leave us, please.

14:22.728 --> 14:25.163
You wouldn't listen to her.

14:25.165 --> 14:27.832
So now you must deal with me.

14:39.190 --> 14:42.325
I've studied the effects
of trauma and abuse.

14:42.327 --> 14:44.527
The witches that forced
you into that ritual,

14:44.529 --> 14:45.595
they've lied to you.

14:45.597 --> 14:47.630
- They hurt you.
- Cami...

14:47.632 --> 14:49.132
There's nothing you've studied in some book

14:49.134 --> 14:51.000
that can help me.

14:51.002 --> 14:55.204
Ok. Forget the books.

14:55.206 --> 14:58.441
Let me tell you what
I know from experience.

14:58.443 --> 15:02.378
When my brother died, I
never thought I'd be ok again.

15:02.380 --> 15:04.213
I cried for weeks. I blamed myself.

15:04.215 --> 15:06.149
I blamed him, and then I realized

15:06.151 --> 15:10.553
all that sadness was swallowing me up,

15:10.555 --> 15:14.023
and I made a choice I
wasn't going to let it.

15:14.025 --> 15:17.527
You can make that choice, Davina.

15:18.629 --> 15:22.064
You say that like it's so simple,

15:22.066 --> 15:24.867
but the witches aren't
just gonna let me go.

15:24.869 --> 15:26.636
They're not done with me.

15:26.638 --> 15:29.505
No one can control you unless you let them.

15:29.507 --> 15:31.874
How do I even know who to trust?

15:31.876 --> 15:34.543
Should I trust Marcel?

15:35.579 --> 15:37.580
The first thing he did when I came back

15:37.582 --> 15:40.416
was try to use me again to help Rebekah.

15:41.718 --> 15:44.587
Be honest, Cami.

15:44.589 --> 15:46.589
Isn't there something you want, too?

15:48.425 --> 15:51.160
Yeah. My Uncle is sick.

15:51.162 --> 15:53.395
I thought you could help him.

15:55.866 --> 15:58.067
That's not why I'm here.

15:58.069 --> 16:01.237
I care about you. I want to help you.

16:01.239 --> 16:02.838
What can you do?

16:02.840 --> 16:04.840
When I came back, the voices I heard,

16:04.842 --> 16:06.542
they said the only ones who could help me

16:06.544 --> 16:08.977
are the witches, but
after what I did to them,

16:08.979 --> 16:11.580
they hate me.

16:11.582 --> 16:14.616
So how can I go back and
ask for their help now?

16:24.360 --> 16:27.296
Rebekah: What a fool I am.

16:27.298 --> 16:30.265
I actually thought Davina
would come to the rescue.

16:30.267 --> 16:31.633
I'll get someone else.

16:31.635 --> 16:32.935
Whole town is full of witches.

16:32.937 --> 16:34.469
All of whom despise you.

16:34.471 --> 16:35.704
I'll figure this out.

16:35.706 --> 16:36.872
Meantime, just don't piss Klaus off

16:36.874 --> 16:38.206
any more than he already is.

16:38.208 --> 16:39.808
It's a little late for that.

16:39.810 --> 16:42.144
I may have provoked him further,

16:42.146 --> 16:44.613
but then, I didn't much
care for his accusations

16:44.615 --> 16:46.782
that you seduced me into bringing Mikael.

16:46.784 --> 16:49.584
Wait a minute. I would never do that.

16:53.756 --> 16:56.291
We almost got away.

16:56.293 --> 16:57.592
If we just kept going,

16:57.594 --> 16:59.861
we could be anywhere in the world by now.

17:01.297 --> 17:03.298
Klaus might've found us and killed us,

17:03.300 --> 17:05.367
but he'll do that, anyway.

17:05.368 --> 17:08.103
Would've been nice to have
a little happiness first.

17:08.105 --> 17:10.771
He's not gonna kill you. You're his sister.

17:10.773 --> 17:12.140
And you're like a son to him,

17:12.142 --> 17:14.309
and, believe me, he means to kill you.

17:18.013 --> 17:22.349
You know, I've never
much thought about dying,

17:22.352 --> 17:25.053
one of the perks of
being immortal, I guess.

17:27.021 --> 17:30.692
What an odd thing it
is to be here one minute

17:30.694 --> 17:33.228
and gone the next...

17:34.663 --> 17:36.664
rather terrifying.

17:38.868 --> 17:40.075
Rebekah...

17:40.077 --> 17:42.777
You need to run, Marcel.

17:42.779 --> 17:44.612
When the moon reaches its apex,

17:44.614 --> 17:46.047
Klaus will be free, and he will do to you

17:46.049 --> 17:49.784
what he's going to do to me, only worse.

17:49.786 --> 17:53.154
Go now and don't look back.

17:53.156 --> 17:54.889
[Beep]

17:56.759 --> 17:59.060
Klaus: So what's it gonna be?

17:59.062 --> 18:01.229
You hold both weapons.

18:01.231 --> 18:02.797
Tunde's blade'd put me down,

18:02.799 --> 18:05.466
but the stake could finish me off for good.

18:05.468 --> 18:08.303
Well... unlike you, brother...
I have no taste for fratricide.

18:08.305 --> 18:12.173
I only hold this to keep it from you.

18:13.742 --> 18:15.109
This is just my insurance.

18:15.111 --> 18:18.079
Why must you defend her?

18:18.081 --> 18:20.448
Rebekah betrayed you, as well,

18:20.450 --> 18:22.050
when she brought Mikael here.

18:22.052 --> 18:24.152
Because she is our sister

18:24.154 --> 18:26.120
and because I like to remember
her the way that she was

18:26.122 --> 18:28.756
before we became what we became.

18:28.758 --> 18:30.291
Ha ha ha!

18:30.293 --> 18:31.492
Elijah, voice-over: She
was an innocent girl,

18:31.494 --> 18:34.328
quick to laugh, full of life.

18:36.396 --> 18:41.067
My memories serve to make
her betrayal more painful.

18:41.069 --> 18:43.803
Can you not then accept
some small part of the blame?

18:43.805 --> 18:46.339
After all, Niklaus, it was your cruelty

18:46.341 --> 18:48.207
that led her to do what she did.

18:48.209 --> 18:49.542
Do you not see, Elijah?

18:49.544 --> 18:50.843
She didn't mean to chase me off.

18:50.845 --> 18:52.044
She wanted me dead.

18:52.046 --> 18:53.479
You're wrong.

18:53.481 --> 18:56.816
She has always hated me.

18:56.818 --> 18:58.851
You know that's true.

18:58.853 --> 19:01.587
You have no idea, do you?

19:01.634 --> 19:05.603
You have no idea what she
was prepared to do for you.

19:05.605 --> 19:08.472
When our sister sees
something that she perceives

19:08.474 --> 19:10.641
to be an injustice, she can be stubborn,

19:10.643 --> 19:14.778
impetuous, and, at times,
downright dangerous,

19:14.780 --> 19:16.580
and never was this more apparent

19:16.582 --> 19:19.483
than the night she
tried to kill our father.

19:19.485 --> 19:21.418
What is this,

19:21.420 --> 19:23.420
some melodramatic fiction

19:23.422 --> 19:25.456
designed to garner my sympathy?

19:25.458 --> 19:27.791
It is the truth.

19:29.194 --> 19:30.928
I was there...

19:32.163 --> 19:34.831
Elijah, voice-over: And
she would have done it,

19:34.833 --> 19:39.336
all to protect you, had I not stopped her.

19:43.141 --> 19:46.743
I often wished that I
could revisit that moment,

19:46.745 --> 19:49.112
complete the task myself.

19:49.114 --> 19:52.616
Why are you telling me this now?

19:52.618 --> 19:56.153
Niklaus, sometimes our
sister acts without thinking.

19:56.155 --> 19:57.587
She's short of temper.

19:57.589 --> 20:01.091
She's quick to fall in
love, but she loves you,

20:01.093 --> 20:05.529
but your malicious treatment
has broken her heart.

20:05.531 --> 20:08.098
So, yes, she responded
by summoning our father.

20:08.100 --> 20:10.834
Yes, that was a mistake.

20:10.836 --> 20:13.670
I'm not entirely sure that I can blame her.

20:17.708 --> 20:19.542
I can.

20:24.649 --> 20:25.882
Niklaus, so help me...

20:25.884 --> 20:27.884
Are you really going to stand against me?

20:27.886 --> 20:29.552
And not with that pathetic blade.

20:29.554 --> 20:31.621
You'd just have to pull it out someday,

20:31.623 --> 20:34.290
and then I'd hate you as I do her now.

20:34.292 --> 20:36.693
If you want to protect Rebekah,

20:36.695 --> 20:39.662
you'll need to use the white oak stake.

20:39.664 --> 20:41.731
I don't have to listen to this nonsense.

20:41.733 --> 20:45.001
Oh, don't pretend you
haven't thought about it.

20:45.003 --> 20:46.502
You look at me, and you see

20:46.504 --> 20:49.172
everything you abhor in yourself.

20:49.174 --> 20:51.574
Sure, you dress it up with your fancy suits

20:51.576 --> 20:54.544
and your handkerchiefs.

20:54.546 --> 20:59.549
You with your mask of
civility and eloquence,

20:59.551 --> 21:04.654
you're every bit the
abomination I am or worse.

21:04.656 --> 21:09.258
Go on, Elijah. Go on.

21:09.260 --> 21:12.261
Use the white oak stake.

21:16.567 --> 21:20.870
I'm not so cowardly that I
have to kill you, Niklaus,

21:20.872 --> 21:23.906
but if I have to make you
suffer to protect Rebekah,

21:23.908 --> 21:27.043
that is what I will do.

21:28.879 --> 21:31.080
You see?

21:31.082 --> 21:32.915
I knew you couldn't do it.

21:32.917 --> 21:34.917
You still cling to the hope

21:34.919 --> 21:36.619
that I can be redeemed,

21:36.621 --> 21:40.556
and if the bastard can be saved,

21:40.558 --> 21:42.658
then maybe there's hope for you.

21:44.294 --> 21:46.462
Aah!

21:46.464 --> 21:48.130
There.

21:48.132 --> 21:50.900
Now you know how it feels.

21:50.902 --> 21:54.603
Aagh! Aah!

21:57.073 --> 21:59.141
That was supposed to be my line.

22:01.077 --> 22:04.647
Now I have this.

22:04.649 --> 22:08.317
So I decide who lives and who dies.

22:17.530 --> 22:19.264
I'm taking out that blade.

22:19.266 --> 22:20.899
You'll have to kill me first,

22:20.901 --> 22:22.434
and now you hold the means to do so.

22:22.436 --> 22:25.436
Why not finish what you
started a century ago?

22:25.438 --> 22:28.506
I did not want you dead.
I wanted you to run.

22:28.508 --> 22:30.942
Liar! You wanted revenge.

22:30.944 --> 22:33.077
You drove me to betray you,

22:33.079 --> 22:34.546
and now you want to twist it

22:34.548 --> 22:35.914
and make it worse so you can justify

22:35.916 --> 22:38.917
killing me instead of
accepting your own fault.

22:38.919 --> 22:40.752
All I did was love your friend.

22:40.754 --> 22:43.721
You could've been happy for us,

22:43.723 --> 22:47.558
but instead in your paranoia,

22:47.560 --> 22:49.627
you feared losing us both,

22:49.629 --> 22:52.730
and, because of that, you did.

22:52.732 --> 22:57.502
There is no one else to blame, Nik,

22:57.504 --> 23:00.204
only you.

23:00.206 --> 23:03.841
Where is Marcel now, hmm?

23:03.843 --> 23:06.444
I thought he loved you,

23:06.446 --> 23:09.947
and yet he left you
trapped in here with me.

23:12.117 --> 23:14.619
Genevieve: The trouble with
the witches in this city

23:14.621 --> 23:16.253
is, they lack direction.

23:16.255 --> 23:20.024
Fortunately, our coven
has found a new leader...

23:20.026 --> 23:21.792
me.

23:21.794 --> 23:23.494
You ask a favor of me,

23:23.496 --> 23:25.596
to lower Celeste's boundary spell,

23:25.598 --> 23:27.598
but you don't control the witches anymore.

23:27.600 --> 23:28.966
You want to help your people,

23:28.968 --> 23:30.968
you need to broker peace,

23:30.970 --> 23:32.636
a treaty with the vampires.

23:32.638 --> 23:34.171
I can help.

23:34.173 --> 23:36.273
The last time I arrived for a negotiation,

23:36.275 --> 23:37.641
you tried to kill me.

23:37.643 --> 23:39.076
I learned my lesson...

23:39.078 --> 23:40.611
if you can't beat them, make them an offer.

23:40.613 --> 23:41.846
So here's the deal.

23:41.848 --> 23:45.015
You help me right now...
you have my word...

23:45.017 --> 23:46.884
vampires stay out of the Cauldron,

23:46.886 --> 23:49.286
no more executions.

23:49.288 --> 23:51.789
A nice start, but if you want my help

23:51.791 --> 23:53.357
lowering that spell,

23:53.359 --> 23:56.894
you're going to have to
give us Davina Claire.

23:58.697 --> 24:01.465
Haven't your people
done enough to that girl?

24:01.467 --> 24:04.368
You must know it's your
fault she suffered in death.

24:04.370 --> 24:06.136
She was shunned by the ancestors

24:06.138 --> 24:08.038
because of her alliance with you,

24:08.040 --> 24:10.040
but all that's over.

24:10.042 --> 24:11.775
Now we can welcome her home.

24:11.777 --> 24:13.644
She will be revered by her people,

24:13.646 --> 24:16.380
and I will teach her
how to control her power,

24:16.382 --> 24:18.849
give her a home where she's safe,

24:18.851 --> 24:22.386
not surrounded by vampires.

24:22.388 --> 24:24.655
Bring Davina to us,

24:24.657 --> 24:28.158
and I'll find a way to
break Celeste's spell.

24:28.160 --> 24:31.128
If not, well, let's just say

24:31.130 --> 24:33.897
that I won't be the one to mourn Rebekah.

24:35.333 --> 24:37.334
Klaus: You against me?

24:37.336 --> 24:38.802
It's hardly a fair fight, is it?

24:38.804 --> 24:40.237
I mean, perhaps, if Marcel were here,

24:40.239 --> 24:42.906
you'd stand a chance, but I expect

24:42.908 --> 24:45.642
he's already found another girl,

24:45.644 --> 24:48.245
no doubt younger and prettier.

24:48.247 --> 24:50.046
You take joy in other people's pain,

24:50.048 --> 24:51.681
and then you wonder why I hate you.

24:51.683 --> 24:54.884
Yes, and that hatred led
you to do what you did.

24:54.886 --> 24:56.820
Admit the truth.

24:56.822 --> 24:58.722
Admit you wanted me dead.

24:58.724 --> 25:00.924
I wanted you to run... that is all...

25:00.926 --> 25:02.525
despite your delusions.

25:02.527 --> 25:04.194
Elijah lies suffering,

25:04.196 --> 25:06.096
and I will allow you to help him.

25:06.098 --> 25:08.064
All you have to do is admit it.

25:08.066 --> 25:10.533
- You're insane.
- Yes! Yes!

25:10.535 --> 25:12.836
I am a vicious, heartless monster,

25:12.838 --> 25:14.437
and so you summoned Mikael to kill me.

25:14.439 --> 25:15.905
- Admit it.
- It's not true.

25:15.907 --> 25:17.407
You know what you did.

25:17.409 --> 25:18.541
- Admit it.
- I didn't.

25:18.543 --> 25:21.478
You wanted me dead!

25:21.480 --> 25:25.381
Admit it.

25:32.856 --> 25:35.558
Maybe I did.

25:40.464 --> 25:42.331
[Panting]

25:43.767 --> 25:45.334
Nik...

26:01.563 --> 26:04.331
[Wind whistling]

26:22.116 --> 26:24.918
You missed my heart.

26:24.920 --> 26:27.687
Perhaps I did...

26:29.757 --> 26:33.560
Or perhaps I never meant to kill you.

26:33.562 --> 26:35.729
Perhaps I just wanted
you to feel a fraction

26:35.731 --> 26:39.566
the fear I felt when father came for me.

26:39.568 --> 26:42.802
Do you yourself know the truth?

26:42.804 --> 26:44.871
I know this.

26:44.873 --> 26:47.240
You accuse me of being evil,

26:47.242 --> 26:49.676
and yet you are the one who conspired

26:49.678 --> 26:51.911
to kill your own blood.

26:51.913 --> 26:54.214
You made our lives a living hell.

26:54.216 --> 26:56.249
You tormented us.

26:56.251 --> 26:58.752
I love my family...

26:58.754 --> 27:02.622
you, Elijah.

27:04.959 --> 27:07.460
I loved all of you.

27:15.703 --> 27:18.238
I know I can be difficult,

27:18.240 --> 27:21.441
but I did not make myself this way.

27:23.444 --> 27:26.913
It was Mikael who ruined me.

27:26.915 --> 27:30.116
He ruined me, too.

27:30.118 --> 27:32.018
That's what you forget.

27:34.755 --> 27:36.956
Centuries later,

27:36.958 --> 27:39.492
each of us is broken...

27:39.494 --> 27:43.129
you with your anger and paranoia,

27:43.131 --> 27:48.100
me with my fear of abandonment...

27:50.304 --> 27:52.672
and poor Elijah...

27:54.841 --> 27:56.475
he dedicates himself

27:56.477 --> 27:59.278
to everyone but himself.

28:01.915 --> 28:04.150
We are the strongest
creatures in the world,

28:04.152 --> 28:07.186
and yet was are damaged beyond repair.

28:08.955 --> 28:11.524
We live without hope,

28:11.526 --> 28:14.193
but we will never die.

28:17.264 --> 28:21.867
We are the definition of "cursed"...

28:21.869 --> 28:25.905
always and forever.

28:33.213 --> 28:35.414
How is she?

28:35.416 --> 28:37.049
Depressed.

28:37.051 --> 28:38.851
She needs real help, maybe a stay

28:38.853 --> 28:40.119
in an institution where she can get

28:40.121 --> 28:41.653
round-the-clock care and medication.

28:41.655 --> 28:43.689
No, no, no. She stays in a place like that,

28:43.691 --> 28:44.690
she is never getting out.

28:44.692 --> 28:47.426
You have a better idea?

28:49.629 --> 28:51.864
I could take her back to her people.

28:53.233 --> 28:54.533
What?

28:54.535 --> 28:56.835
There are bigger things
going on here, Cami.

28:56.837 --> 28:58.337
It's the only chance that she has.

28:58.339 --> 28:59.504
We have to talk about this.

28:59.506 --> 29:01.673
I'm not asking for permission.

29:21.294 --> 29:23.829
Yaah!

29:23.831 --> 29:25.764
Uh! Aah!

29:25.766 --> 29:28.600
Ugh...

29:28.602 --> 29:31.136
Now we're even.

29:36.442 --> 29:38.443
[Trumpet playing]

29:42.972 --> 29:44.973
So we have a deal?

29:44.975 --> 29:46.308
Davina is asleep.

29:46.310 --> 29:47.676
When she wakes up, I'll explain everything.

29:47.678 --> 29:48.944
Then I'll bring her here.

29:48.946 --> 29:50.845
Meantime, we need to lower that barrier.

29:50.847 --> 29:52.781
Celeste cast a powerful spell.

29:52.783 --> 29:56.117
Fortunately for you, she's gone.

29:56.119 --> 29:59.154
Her power bled back into the earth.

30:00.523 --> 30:03.691
Now I can channel it, manipulate it.

30:03.693 --> 30:05.527
It'll take some doing,

30:05.529 --> 30:07.228
but then, I'm pretty good at what I do.

30:07.230 --> 30:08.963
One more thing,

30:08.965 --> 30:10.999
I need you to fix the priest.

30:11.001 --> 30:13.968
Sorry.

30:13.970 --> 30:16.304
A hex like that, if it's
had time to take root,

30:16.306 --> 30:18.306
there's no undoing it.

30:18.308 --> 30:21.276
Fine. Just get Rebekah out.

30:21.278 --> 30:24.579
I'll have to undo the entire spell.

30:24.581 --> 30:26.114
Can't let one Original out

30:26.116 --> 30:27.482
without letting them all out.

30:27.484 --> 30:29.450
It doesn't matter, and just so you know,

30:29.452 --> 30:32.487
even if Klaus is free, if
you hurt Davina in any way...

30:32.489 --> 30:36.791
Marcel, it's over. You lost.

to do to me, do it now.

What's done is never done.

31:18.835 --> 31:21.001
It remains within us,

31:48.129 --> 31:50.564
What is it you want, Rebekah?

31:50.566 --> 31:53.967
Same things that I've
wanted since I was a child.

31:55.003 --> 31:59.573
I want a home. I want a family.

31:59.575 --> 32:02.576

Then go.

32:11.719 --> 32:16.223
Go far away and never come back.

volatile mix of ingredients.
