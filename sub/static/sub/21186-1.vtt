00:03.648 --> 00:05.848
Hi. I'm Rachael Gwizdaiski.

00:05.850 --> 00:07.550
I have a funny family.

00:07.552 --> 00:09.552
They all are sort of different.

00:09.554 --> 00:13.455
Let's go find them and
see if they will talk.

00:13.457 --> 00:15.858
Come on. Let's go.

00:20.298 --> 00:21.831
This is my sister.

00:21.833 --> 00:23.632
OK. You might want to tape your dad

00:23.634 --> 00:25.334
making a world-class

00:25.336 --> 00:27.703
Hamburger Helper dinner.

00:27.705 --> 00:30.239
He's making a Hamburger Helper dinner.

00:30.241 --> 00:32.741
Yes. You guys are
having dog food tonight.

00:32.743 --> 00:35.010
How do you like that?

00:35.012 --> 00:38.147
That's Daddy, Mommy...

00:38.149 --> 00:40.683
hello, Penny...

00:40.685 --> 00:45.688
and I'm Rachael, the one who
made the video about my family.

00:47.191 --> 00:50.259
Next time, join me for another video.

00:50.261 --> 00:53.128
I can't think of what
I'm gonna do next, though.

00:53.130 --> 00:57.933
Um, it's Friday, July 27,

00:57.935 --> 01:02.171
and I'm a little over two
months on testosterone,

01:02.173 --> 01:05.741
two months and 6 days...

01:07.411 --> 01:10.479
and my name is Ben because I changed it.

01:33.304 --> 01:35.471
All I really want is to, like...

01:35.473 --> 01:37.606
I just want to be loved by my family,

01:37.608 --> 01:41.710
and I think that for my family,
it's not as simple as that.

01:44.682 --> 01:47.416
I mean, it's complicated for them.

02:10.942 --> 02:13.976
A little bit.

02:13.978 --> 02:15.978
Some of the things are something

02:15.980 --> 02:18.414
I just put aside because I thought

02:18.416 --> 02:22.584
if you ever had a child one day...

02:22.586 --> 02:24.620
You are not wearing that.

02:24.622 --> 02:27.156
This doesn't fit any... oh, it doesn't.

02:27.158 --> 02:29.992
Wow. I have a lot of Pokemon cards.

02:29.994 --> 02:32.761
I really never saw the allure.

02:32.763 --> 02:35.464
Wow. These probably are worth something.

02:35.466 --> 02:38.233
- Did I pick these out?
- No.

02:38.235 --> 02:40.636
You guys did, and I just
wore them everywhere?

02:40.638 --> 02:42.471
- Uh-huh.
- Oh, my God.

02:42.473 --> 02:44.139
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, no.

02:44.141 --> 02:45.541
Is that the cutest?

02:45.543 --> 02:48.944
Did I carry this fanny
pack of my own face around,

02:48.946 --> 02:50.446
or was this for you guys to carry,

02:50.448 --> 02:53.115
a fanny pack with a picture of me on it?

02:53.117 --> 02:55.217
You in your little soccer uniform.

02:55.219 --> 02:57.553
With my missing two front teeth.

03:02.493 --> 03:06.095
That was our Christmas card. Hmm.

03:18.242 --> 03:20.376
When I was younger,

03:20.378 --> 03:23.746
I hated using the women's restrooms.

03:23.748 --> 03:25.914
Yes. The ball.

03:25.916 --> 03:27.516
My mom would try to get me

03:27.518 --> 03:30.820
to get my ears pierced so
people would know I was a girl.

03:36.293 --> 03:41.330
I was a tomboy for a very long time,

03:41.332 --> 03:44.700
up until I got to middle school
and puberty started happening.

03:44.702 --> 03:46.535
Everybody was changing.

03:46.537 --> 03:50.139
♪ Happy birthday, dear Rachael ♪

03:50.141 --> 03:51.607
♪ Cha cha cha ♪

03:51.609 --> 03:53.008
♪ Happy... ♪

03:53.010 --> 03:54.543
I felt like I either had to, like,

03:54.545 --> 03:57.613
grow my hair out or be
a loser or be an outcast

03:57.615 --> 04:00.049
or, you know, like, be different,

04:00.051 --> 04:04.386
and I didn't want to be different.

04:05.656 --> 04:09.158
I started cutting myself
when I was really young,

04:09.160 --> 04:13.128
and I think that was my first addiction.

04:13.130 --> 04:18.100
It was definitely how I
dealt with feeling so wrong.

04:20.370 --> 04:23.539
I was stealing from the people around me

04:23.541 --> 04:27.142
and doing drugs that
I swore I'd never do...

04:29.480 --> 04:31.680
and my dad was gambling a lot,

04:31.682 --> 04:34.950
and my mom was watching
her family fall apart.

04:36.987 --> 04:41.090
3 years ago was, like, the
last time that I cut myself

04:41.092 --> 04:43.792
because I went too deep.

04:43.794 --> 04:48.197
I remember the doctor coming in
and, like, opening up the wound,

04:48.199 --> 04:52.701
and she was like, "Oh,
honey, you slashed a tendon,"

04:52.703 --> 04:54.903
like, "You're gonna
have to get surgery."

05:08.919 --> 05:10.285
... bother me.

05:10.287 --> 05:13.155
Like, I would say, after
being, like, 6 months...

05:13.157 --> 05:17.426
I don't want to be a
girl. I just want to be me.

05:17.428 --> 05:19.928
My body isn't how I
want it to be, either.

05:19.930 --> 05:23.532
People don't understand what
I go through on a daily basis...

05:23.534 --> 05:26.535
There's a large number of guys and girls

05:26.537 --> 05:29.905
out there who are transitioning,
sharing their experiences,

05:29.907 --> 05:32.107
and sharing hope with each other.

05:32.109 --> 05:36.345
It's OK to not be 6'3". It's
OK to not have facial hair.

05:36.347 --> 05:38.547
My parents actually
still don't call me Keith,

05:38.549 --> 05:40.082
still call me Kim.

05:40.084 --> 05:44.386
Hey, guys, I have decided
to talk about, like, dating

05:44.388 --> 05:48.257
and how it's been going, being
a trans kid in high school.

05:55.666 --> 05:59.001
The greatest gifts that I received

05:59.003 --> 06:01.803
while browsing was that
I knew I wasn't alone.

06:10.915 --> 06:14.550
I got sober because
I could no longer deny

06:14.552 --> 06:19.621
that there was a solution
to what I was going through,

06:19.623 --> 06:21.924
which was transition.

06:24.728 --> 06:27.696
This is how I'm going to explain it.

06:27.698 --> 06:32.734
I am literally a boy

06:32.736 --> 06:35.871
with the wrong body parts.

06:38.142 --> 06:40.108
No. I just think, you know,

06:40.110 --> 06:43.612
that there is the argument of...

06:43.614 --> 06:45.681
you're not.

06:45.683 --> 06:48.917
I just don't get... I'm just...

06:48.919 --> 06:50.652
Our thinking goes back to...

06:50.654 --> 06:51.720
It still baffles me.

06:51.722 --> 06:53.555
... what defines what is a boy.

06:53.557 --> 06:57.492
Is it your brain or is it your body?

06:58.862 --> 07:01.964
In our hearts, you're Rachael.

07:01.966 --> 07:04.900
That's what we've known you as,

07:04.902 --> 07:08.570
and that's a hard habit to break.

07:08.572 --> 07:11.506
What's so wrong with the opinion of

07:11.508 --> 07:14.042
you are who you are and
you get what you get,

07:14.044 --> 07:15.744
and I get, you know...

07:15.746 --> 07:19.448
Is that why you got plastic surgery?

07:19.450 --> 07:22.951
Enhancing what you have,
is that all right with you?

07:22.953 --> 07:25.487
Where do you draw the
line? You get what you get.

07:25.489 --> 07:27.589
Stop getting haircuts and hair dye.

07:27.591 --> 07:30.592
Stop piercing your ears.
Stop putting on makeup.

07:32.129 --> 07:36.732
Like, what I have

07:36.734 --> 07:41.303
is a body that doesn't fit.

07:43.340 --> 07:45.941
Hey, Rachael, how old are you today?

07:45.943 --> 07:47.409
5.

07:47.411 --> 07:50.212
You want to open up the presents?

07:50.214 --> 07:53.582
What I wanted, what I always,

07:53.584 --> 07:57.619
always wanted... a suit jacket.

07:57.621 --> 08:01.923
Oh, man, is that exciting?

08:01.925 --> 08:04.993
Yes.

08:04.995 --> 08:07.829
We all have accepted this

08:07.831 --> 08:10.699
for a long, long time,
and that was Rachael,

08:10.701 --> 08:13.135
and that is what I've
tried to explain to you,

08:13.137 --> 08:14.970
that you are Rachael.

08:14.972 --> 08:17.506
That is who you are.
Everyone knows you as this.

08:17.508 --> 08:19.374
They know that you're... you know,

08:19.376 --> 08:22.244
you march to your own
drummer, and you are quirky,

08:22.246 --> 08:24.112
and that's why they all love you,

08:24.114 --> 08:27.683
and this whole flip to, you know,

08:27.685 --> 08:30.719
"No. It's not just quirky."

08:30.721 --> 08:36.924
"It's, you know, I'm in
the wrong body," is...

08:36.927 --> 08:39.294
You know, I think we
all have that feeling of,

08:39.296 --> 08:41.129
"I'm in the wrong body.

08:41.131 --> 08:43.365
I should be in Charlize Theron's body."

08:46.003 --> 08:50.372
You know, he is saving up for surgery,

08:50.374 --> 08:53.775
and she went to therapy for 6 months

08:53.777 --> 08:55.877
so she could get
hormones, and it was like,

08:55.879 --> 08:58.280
"That's all it takes, is 6 months?"

08:58.282 --> 09:01.083
That just seems like
a short amount of time

09:01.085 --> 09:07.255
for someone that has changed
her... his mind so often,

09:07.257 --> 09:12.561
um, to make a decision
as serious as this one.

09:19.269 --> 09:21.303
I wish that my family would be willing

09:21.305 --> 09:24.172
to, like, give me a chance.

09:24.174 --> 09:27.642
My sister isn't talking to me

09:27.644 --> 09:29.878
and my dad, which sucks, you know?

09:29.880 --> 09:33.281
Like, I'm very angry at my parents.

09:37.221 --> 09:39.855
It gets hard when they
don't answer your phone calls

09:39.857 --> 09:42.524
or don't want to see you.

10:53.697 --> 10:56.097
"Hey, guys, this is Dyl... "

10:56.099 --> 10:58.366
Ha ha ha! It was so funny.

10:58.368 --> 10:59.768
Dylan is my best friend.

10:59.770 --> 11:01.236
It was so cute.

11:01.238 --> 11:02.537
We're both, like, sober and trans,

11:02.539 --> 11:04.673
and our friends knew
each other and were like,

11:04.675 --> 11:07.275
"Why don't we introduce them?"

11:07.277 --> 11:09.377
We've known each other
for a very short time,

11:09.379 --> 11:13.014
but I have never had
a friend like Dylan...

11:15.986 --> 11:18.687
and we're about to move
to Santa Cruz together

11:18.689 --> 11:21.356
in a few months and
start at the same school,

11:21.358 --> 11:25.760
and it's funny how, like,
I've never felt so close

11:25.762 --> 11:28.530
to a friend.

11:30.601 --> 11:32.901
All our pictures that
we have on Facebook

11:32.903 --> 11:34.736
we need to do again but with beards

11:34.738 --> 11:37.072
Ha ha ha! with stripes.

11:37.074 --> 11:39.140
Clothes, we're wearing
just the striped shirts.

11:39.142 --> 11:40.742
Yes. Oh, wait.

11:40.744 --> 11:42.377
Didn't we start doing
it on the same side

11:42.379 --> 11:43.645
so we'd have this?

11:43.647 --> 11:44.913
Yeah. I'm on left side today.

11:44.915 --> 11:46.648
- Me, too.
- Oh, yeah.

11:46.650 --> 11:48.650
That means we're on schedule.

11:48.652 --> 11:50.252
Our testosterone shots

11:50.254 --> 11:51.987
are on the same day, Monday,

11:51.989 --> 11:55.590
and so we're Skyping our injections.

11:55.592 --> 11:58.326
I can't wait till we can actually

11:58.328 --> 12:00.595
do this next to each other again.

12:02.266 --> 12:04.933
Do I have a beard yet?

12:04.935 --> 12:06.801
- Yeah?
- Dude, totally.

12:06.803 --> 12:08.670
Ha ha ha!

12:08.672 --> 12:11.339
Did you tell your coworker I'm single?

12:11.341 --> 12:13.775
Chk chk chk chk chk. Ha ha ha!

12:13.777 --> 12:16.011
She's not single. No.

12:16.013 --> 12:17.812
Oh, damn it.

12:17.814 --> 12:21.116
We booked our top surgeries
for the same day...

12:21.118 --> 12:24.786
December 27 of this year,
which is in, like, 5 months...

12:24.788 --> 12:29.424
to go to Dr. Garramone in Florida,

12:29.426 --> 12:32.227
and his mom is paying for
our airfare and our hotel,

12:32.229 --> 12:34.262
and she's gonna come
and take care of us,

12:34.264 --> 12:36.698
which is insane because my mom wouldn't.

12:37.199 --> 12:39.300
_

12:39.301 --> 12:41.301
_

12:42.039 --> 12:43.771
- Oh...
- _

12:44.708 --> 12:46.608
Mm-hmm.

12:50.280 --> 12:52.414
OK, so you don't want me there.

12:58.422 --> 13:01.056
I didn't... I never said that.

13:01.058 --> 13:03.258
You had no interest in
participating, and...

13:03.260 --> 13:05.527
No. I... that's not what I said.

13:05.529 --> 13:08.797
I said... you wanted...
as far as financial...

13:08.799 --> 13:10.532
I'm not gonna pay for your plane ticket.

13:10.534 --> 13:13.335
I'm not asking you to
pay for my plane ticket,

13:13.337 --> 13:15.604
but, I mean, if you're gonna undergo

13:15.606 --> 13:17.539
some serious surgery...

13:17.541 --> 13:19.240
It's not, I mean, super serious.

13:19.242 --> 13:20.875
Yeah. It is.

13:20.877 --> 13:22.844
It's really OK if it's just them.

13:22.846 --> 13:25.180
- That's all.
- Oh.

13:25.182 --> 13:27.449
That's how you want it.

13:45.469 --> 13:47.936
It's hard being around
a lot of my friends

13:47.938 --> 13:51.206
because, you know, they're
talking about their kids

13:51.208 --> 13:53.975
and their kids' successes and, you know,

13:53.977 --> 13:56.678
"My child's going to
Harvard," or has a scholarship,

13:56.680 --> 14:00.815
and, "And how's Rachael?" and I'm...

14:04.354 --> 14:08.990
"Oh, fine, you know,
finding... finding their way,

14:08.992 --> 14:10.992
finding his way," you know,

14:10.994 --> 14:14.362
kind of, like, blurring
over the pronoun.

14:17.300 --> 14:19.801
My mom's all about, like, looking good,

14:19.803 --> 14:22.037
and, like, you know, she
hasn't even been supportive

14:22.039 --> 14:24.973
of the idea of my surgery,

22:54.284 --> 22:56.951
breaking it to the family,

22:56.953 --> 22:59.754
to my brother and sister-in-law,

22:59.756 --> 23:01.389

23:01.391 --> 23:03.457
we were at Jack... Norman's, and I...

23:03.459 --> 23:06.994
"I need to tell you something,"

23:06.996 --> 23:09.497
and then when I said that, you know,

23:09.499 --> 23:12.600

23:29.152 --> 23:32.687

my high-school reunions,

23:32.689 --> 23:36.257

"Oh, do you remember so and so?

23:36.259 --> 23:41.229
He's a... he's a woman now,"
and I... even back then,

23:41.231 --> 23:45.433
I don't know that that was
called, um, transgender.

23:45.435 --> 23:48.536

23:49.572 --> 23:55.243

23:55.245 --> 24:00.081
you know, "preferences"
isn't the right word, but...

24:00.083 --> 24:03.217
whereas we just didn't
talk about stuff like that.

24:03.219 --> 24:07.588

more vocal about it now.

24:11.628 --> 24:15.029

24:15.031 --> 24:18.766
I grew up at the Presbyterian
church, and I was in the choir.

24:20.737 --> 24:23.437
My mother was ahead of her time.

24:23.439 --> 24:26.173
She was about Planned Parenthood.

24:26.175 --> 24:29.877
She was about having one
of her best confidants,

24:29.879 --> 24:33.414
her gay hairdresser, to
the Thanksgiving table.

24:33.416 --> 24:39.287
Um, she was an educated woman,
but I grew up in the mentality

24:39.289 --> 24:41.922
of, "Don't air your dirty laundry."

24:56.506 --> 24:59.273

- "Oh. yeah... "
- No. I get that,

28:24.999 --> 28:26.231
but they, like, should
have newer appliances

28:26.233 --> 28:28.634
because I don't
understand old technology.

28:29.036 --> 28:31.135
What is a... I know
what a pilot light is.

28:31.137 --> 28:32.771
I just don't know how to work it.

28:45.178 --> 28:46.644
Lately, I've been having, like,

28:46.646 --> 28:50.148
physical responses to
anxiety and embarrassment

28:50.150 --> 28:52.550
and nervousness, so,
like, I get really hot

28:52.552 --> 28:55.453
and, like, sweaty, and, like,
I feel like I'm getting red,

28:55.455 --> 29:01.092
and it's harder for me to
talk and... I don't know.

29:03.496 --> 29:05.863
I forget why I might be feeling so sad

29:05.865 --> 29:08.266
or, like, why I'm, like, all up and down

29:08.268 --> 29:10.134
and having these mood
swings, and then it clicks,

29:10.136 --> 29:13.504
and I'm like, "Wow. Hormones
are really changing."

29:15.341 --> 29:17.475
Things are happening inside my body

29:17.477 --> 29:20.711
that are different than
I've ever experienced.

29:28.555 --> 29:32.023
When I'm by myself, like,
my head gets a lot louder.

29:33.893 --> 29:35.860
"Is my chest flat?

29:35.862 --> 29:37.995
Are my shoulders square enough?

29:37.997 --> 29:39.630
What about my hips? Do my hips...

29:39.632 --> 29:41.265
Am I muffin-topping?" you know,

29:41.267 --> 29:43.935
or, like, "Am I acting socially awkward?

29:43.937 --> 29:45.870
Is my voice low enough?

29:45.872 --> 29:48.072
Can they see my binder?"

29:51.044 --> 29:56.214
I wish I could, like, not
worry, but I can't stop.

30:16.869 --> 30:20.471
I'm saving for my top surgery myself.

30:20.473 --> 30:22.974
I'm working full time,
so I'm 5 days a week

30:22.976 --> 30:25.409
at the photo company.

30:29.682 --> 30:32.516
I hate my job, but, like,
I'm going to work every day,

30:32.518 --> 30:34.885
and I'm showing up early,
and I'm staying late,

30:34.887 --> 30:37.555
and, like, I'm being a good worker.

30:39.692 --> 30:41.759
Top surgery is something
worth fighting for.

30:41.761 --> 30:43.761
It's something worth sweating for.

30:43.763 --> 30:47.098
It's something worth grinding
my teeth at work all day for.

31:05.818 --> 31:08.419
It's a drastic surgery,

31:08.421 --> 31:13.658
and I'm not for it.

31:13.660 --> 31:17.194
I feel like I should be there.

31:18.865 --> 31:21.132
I just don't know yet.

Thank you.

32:11.951 --> 32:14.385
Thank you so very much.

32:16.455 --> 32:18.555
For those of you who don't know,

32:18.557 --> 32:21.692
some of the proceeds of tonight
are gonna go to our friend

32:21.694 --> 32:24.361
Bennett Wallace, who is
another singer-songwriter

32:24.363 --> 32:27.431
and a good friend of ours,
and it's going to help fund

32:27.433 --> 32:29.800
surgery for him, and so we thank you all

32:29.802 --> 32:32.736
for, knowingly or unknowingly,
supporting this amazing cause.

32:51.791 --> 32:55.159
Yes.

32:55.161 --> 32:57.761
I've gained or lost 15 pounds.

32:57.763 --> 32:59.930
Do I circle yes?

32:59.932 --> 33:03.267
No, because I don't think
the muscle really matters.

33:03.269 --> 33:07.071
Uh, yeah. Ha! No? Ha ha!

33:11.644 --> 33:13.777
Date of last menstrual period.

33:13.779 --> 33:15.446
I just put my "T" date.

33:19.051 --> 33:22.219
You have to be there at 8:30 A.M.

33:22.221 --> 33:23.887
Do you have transportation for surgery?

33:23.889 --> 33:25.389
- Yes.
- You do.

33:35.401 --> 33:36.934
I can't wait, dude.

33:36.936 --> 33:38.068
His face, though.

34:29.588 --> 34:32.022
I need an arm.

34:35.427 --> 34:38.061
I felt good that she came.

34:38.063 --> 34:46.904
I also feel bad because, uh,
she came, and... I don't know...

34:46.906 --> 34:49.373
it shows that she loves me
that much to do something

34:49.375 --> 34:53.177
that makes her not that happy,

34:53.179 --> 34:56.213
but, you know, to be there
for me when I need her.

35:28.781 --> 35:32.416
Hopefully, it'll be a
quick, quick recovery

35:32.418 --> 35:35.886
and they'll be up and around in no time

35:35.888 --> 35:38.789
and then get on with
the rest of their lives.

35:38.791 --> 35:40.891
I hope that they will find somebody

35:40.893 --> 35:42.259
that, you know...

35:42.261 --> 35:43.861
I absolutely have every confidence

35:43.863 --> 35:45.863
that they will find the
right person for them

35:45.865 --> 35:47.331
because I think there's always

35:47.333 --> 35:49.633
someone for everyone in this world.

35:49.635 --> 35:52.636
You know, Dylan's had girlfriends,

35:52.638 --> 35:56.707
and I just think that he'll find

35:56.709 --> 35:58.709
the right person for him.

35:58.711 --> 36:02.379
Dylan has had girlfriends
since he's been Dylan?

36:02.381 --> 36:04.681
Yeah. Yeah, so I think
it doesn't really make

36:04.683 --> 36:08.585
any difference, um, where
you are on the spectrum.

36:08.587 --> 36:10.754
I think that you'll find the person

36:10.756 --> 36:12.723
that you want to spend your time with

36:12.725 --> 36:16.460
and that you'll love, but, you know,

36:16.462 --> 36:18.295
we're all at different places.

36:18.297 --> 36:19.796
That's the whole thing.

36:19.798 --> 36:22.967
We don't have to necessarily
understand it completely and fully.

36:23.199 --> 36:24.865
We just have to support them,

36:24.867 --> 36:26.233
support them and love them.

36:26.235 --> 36:27.701
Yeah. True.

36:27.703 --> 36:29.303
Love them through it,
that's all you can do.

36:29.305 --> 36:30.804
Be there and love them and support them.

36:30.806 --> 36:32.272
You just nailed it on the head.

36:32.274 --> 36:35.609
It's like, don't really
understand it, but...

36:35.611 --> 36:37.911
There's so many other
people in this world

36:37.913 --> 36:39.713
that would love to bring them down.

36:39.715 --> 36:42.249
We just have to make sure we're not...

36:42.251 --> 36:46.320
not any of those people, you know?

36:51.093 --> 36:52.659
It's OK. Let it go.

36:52.661 --> 36:54.428
It's not your job to be strong.

36:54.430 --> 36:56.430
It's not your job to
feel anything particular.

36:56.432 --> 36:59.066
Just whatever you're feeling is good.

36:59.068 --> 37:01.068
It's OK. Let it go. It's all right.

37:01.070 --> 37:02.970
- It's going.
- That's good.

37:02.972 --> 37:04.705
- Here it comes.
- That's it.

37:04.707 --> 37:06.440
Let it... let it all out.

37:06.442 --> 37:08.308
Just let it out. It's good.

37:42.111 --> 37:44.912
This is so cool,

37:44.914 --> 37:47.214
and the fat isn't hanging out of this...

37:47.216 --> 37:49.716
I mean, I can't even
lift my arms, but...

37:49.718 --> 37:51.084
I'm, like...

37:51.086 --> 37:53.187
I'm talking about chest. No.

37:53.189 --> 37:54.688
Of course, there's stuff up here

37:54.690 --> 37:57.925
because we're bound so tightly, but...

37:57.927 --> 37:59.860
Uh-huh.

38:02.431 --> 38:05.666
Starting to get in a lot of pain.

38:05.668 --> 38:08.735
- Ah!
- Don't do that.

38:08.737 --> 38:10.804
I honestly didn't expect
it to hurt this much...

38:10.806 --> 38:12.239
3 1/2. I didn't, either.

38:12.241 --> 38:14.041
... but that's because
nobody said anything about it.

38:14.043 --> 38:15.475
People were like, "It's gonna hurt,

38:15.477 --> 38:17.311
but it's mostly just, like... "

38:17.313 --> 38:19.046
You know what I mean?

38:19.048 --> 38:20.547
I knew it would hurt, but I didn't know

38:20.549 --> 38:21.849
it would just be, like...

38:21.851 --> 38:24.518
Yesterday was horrible.

38:24.520 --> 38:26.720
I am so glad I don't
remember most of it.

38:26.722 --> 38:28.555
I remember being in
the car and being like,

38:28.557 --> 38:30.724
"I am so frustrated,"
and in so much pain

38:30.726 --> 38:35.796
that I felt like I just wanted to
kick and scream and cry and spit.

38:35.798 --> 38:38.966
Yeah. We should go bowling.

38:47.243 --> 38:49.243
- Hello.
- Hey, how are you?

38:49.245 --> 38:51.078
- Good. How are you?
- I'm good.

38:51.080 --> 38:52.813
I'm a little sore.

38:52.815 --> 38:55.015
- I bet you are.
- Yeah, but...

38:55.017 --> 38:57.217
What's going on? Look at you.

38:57.219 --> 38:59.253
Yeah. Stand up really quick.

38:59.255 --> 39:00.988
Oh, buddy.

39:00.990 --> 39:02.389
Yeah. Yeah.

39:02.391 --> 39:04.224
- Hi, Joe.
- Oh, hi.

39:04.226 --> 39:05.993
- This is Bailey.
- Hi, Bailey.

39:05.995 --> 39:07.361
This is Ben's mom.

39:07.363 --> 39:08.562
Hi, Mom.

39:08.564 --> 39:09.830
I'm just being a buttinsky

39:09.832 --> 39:11.431
and coming in to say hello.

39:11.433 --> 39:12.833
Oh, God, that's so funny.

39:12.835 --> 39:15.602
She's been awesome.
I think I woke her up.

39:15.604 --> 39:17.471
- I've been an emotional...
- Shh!

39:17.473 --> 39:18.906
Oh. I've been an emot...

39:18.908 --> 39:20.540
No. I was just saying that
because that's not true.

39:20.542 --> 39:23.043
Oh, I've been an
emotional roller coaster,

39:23.045 --> 39:25.012
- but...
- My mom, too.

39:25.014 --> 39:27.481
- Yeah.
- She's being modest,

39:27.483 --> 39:29.182
but she's been really, really amazing.

39:29.184 --> 39:31.184
I woke her up every 3 hours.

39:31.186 --> 39:33.287
She was happy to help me

39:33.289 --> 39:36.156
and has just been really
sweet the entire time,

39:36.158 --> 39:39.293
and, like, on top of that,
I know it's hard for her,

39:39.295 --> 39:44.164
so, you know, she's been
really strong and helpful,

39:44.166 --> 39:46.667
even though it's not what she'd

39:46.669 --> 39:48.568
probably rather be doing.

39:48.570 --> 39:50.871
I'll keep you posted as things change

39:50.873 --> 39:53.040
and bandages get taken off and whatnot,

39:53.042 --> 39:54.474
Yeah.

39:54.476 --> 39:56.877
... and I'm looking forward
to seeing you in person

39:56.879 --> 39:59.046
come Februaryish.

39:59.048 --> 40:02.999
- I love you guys. I'm so happy for you.
- Oh, we love you, too.

40:03.051 --> 40:04.051
Thanks so much, Joe.

40:04.053 --> 40:06.653
This couldn't have happened without you.

40:28.811 --> 40:31.645
Not just masculinity because
some of his critics say,

40:31.647 --> 40:34.281
"Well, men have been
masculine for all time,"

40:34.283 --> 40:37.150
you know, but he's talking
about hypermasculinity

40:37.152 --> 40:41.221
contributing to sexual
assault, homicide...

40:41.223 --> 40:42.956
Even just road rage.

40:42.958 --> 40:45.425
... Even just road rage.

40:45.427 --> 40:48.128
Right. Not only are there
those two narrow categories

40:48.130 --> 40:50.030
of what one is supposed to fit in,

40:50.032 --> 40:52.065
but we also know that
there's a hierarchy, right,

40:52.067 --> 40:53.567
and one of those is valued more.

40:53.569 --> 40:56.803
Masculinity is valued
more in our society, right,

40:56.805 --> 40:58.772
so if you fit more into that box...

40:58.774 --> 41:01.008
and I really think the easiest example

41:01.010 --> 41:03.543
is to think of young girls
who are tomboys, right,

41:03.545 --> 41:05.145
which we've talked about,

41:05.147 --> 41:08.181
way more acceptable than
the alternative, right?

41:08.183 --> 41:11.618
All right. Have a great
weekend. Thank you.

41:11.620 --> 41:13.687
Thank you.

41:42.251 --> 41:46.086
It's been hard to get
a hold of Joe lately.

41:46.088 --> 41:48.622
There was one message
that he sent me that said,

41:48.624 --> 41:50.490
"Things have been a little crazy,

41:50.492 --> 41:52.559
hoping to get out of it soon."

41:52.561 --> 41:54.027
It was very vague...

41:56.698 --> 42:00.333
so I honestly don't
know where he's at...

42:02.004 --> 42:06.506
but it is taking him a little
bit longer to get back to me.

42:21.256 --> 42:23.256
I was having an awesome day

42:23.258 --> 42:25.258
with a buddy that I usually party with,

42:25.260 --> 42:30.430
and it was beautiful outside,
and I wanted to smoke some pot,

42:30.432 --> 42:32.899
so I smoked some pot,
and then I was like,

42:32.901 --> 42:35.035
"Let's go have some beers"...

42:38.607 --> 42:40.774
and I went home, and I went to bed,

42:40.776 --> 42:43.276
and I woke up, and I was like,

42:43.278 --> 42:45.378
"All right, so I did that,"

42:45.380 --> 42:49.549
and now it feels like a time warp.

42:56.792 --> 42:59.493
I got my first DUI,

42:59.495 --> 43:01.695
spent the night in jail.

43:04.366 --> 43:06.733
I wish things were better.

43:14.776 --> 43:16.743
Joe?

43:18.981 --> 43:21.114
Good morning.

43:21.116 --> 43:22.749
Ohh! Ha ha!

43:24.219 --> 43:26.153
- Ahh...
- Hey.

43:26.155 --> 43:27.654
Aah! Ha ha ha!

43:27.656 --> 43:30.190
Let me see.

43:30.192 --> 43:32.325
Crazy.

43:33.929 --> 43:36.096
My cute, little nickel nipples.

43:36.098 --> 43:37.864
I know, right? Little nipples.

43:58.153 --> 43:59.920
Eh...

44:29.084 --> 44:31.718
Being that he's been
such a vibrant light

44:31.720 --> 44:35.188
in my life, I just want him to be OK.

44:36.225 --> 44:41.895
There's something that
he needs to answer.

44:44.633 --> 44:47.434
I just hope that he doesn't

44:47.436 --> 44:49.703
get into too much pain

44:49.705 --> 44:53.506
before he finds that for himself.

45:08.757 --> 45:11.124
Which one you want to do?

45:11.126 --> 45:13.093
You should do pumpkin.

45:14.129 --> 45:17.197
Yep. It smells like Thanksgiving.

45:19.268 --> 45:21.234
Wow. It's really reliable.

45:21.236 --> 45:23.236
I know.

45:35.550 --> 45:37.884
My mom bakes cookies and decorates them.

45:37.886 --> 45:39.352
Mm-hmm.

45:39.354 --> 45:40.854
Did you... were you
here for that last year?

45:40.856 --> 45:42.455
- Uh-uh.
- Oh.

45:42.457 --> 45:43.823
Well, we should do it this year.

45:43.825 --> 45:44.991
It's super fun.

45:44.993 --> 45:46.259
She puts on Christmas music and...

45:47.996 --> 45:49.329
My sister just said...

45:50.599 --> 45:52.932
"You are so focused on becoming "you,"

45:52.934 --> 45:55.235
finding yourself, all that [bleep],

45:55.237 --> 45:56.936
I don't think you understand

45:56.938 --> 45:59.005
that some people never
truly find themselves,

45:59.007 --> 46:00.774
and they turn out all right.

46:00.776 --> 46:02.609
You want to be stuck in this immature,

46:02.611 --> 46:05.211
I don't give a [bleep] about
what others think" stage.

46:05.213 --> 46:06.780
It's off-putting, and I don't want

46:06.782 --> 46:08.581
to associate with someone like that."

46:08.583 --> 46:10.183
That's literally so far

46:10.185 --> 46:15.088
from my experience that...

46:25.667 --> 46:28.668
How long do these pies
need to go in there?

46:28.670 --> 46:31.404
Till we smell it burning.

46:33.575 --> 46:35.442
OK. I'm gonna call my dad
and tell him that we've...

46:36.611 --> 46:42.015
made pies and can I bring
one over for dessert.

46:43.752 --> 46:45.452
I was gonna come grab a bite to eat

46:45.454 --> 46:47.687
and say hi to y'all
and spend a little bit

46:47.689 --> 46:49.723
of time with you and Kimmy

46:49.725 --> 46:52.792
and Chelsea and Christina.

46:54.129 --> 46:55.829
OK. Never mind.

46:55.831 --> 46:57.831
I just thought that's
what you were asking.

46:57.833 --> 47:00.266
I thought that's what
you wanted. Never mind.

47:02.104 --> 47:05.338
I'm just not gonna come, Dad.

47:05.340 --> 47:07.107
OK. Well, you know what?

47:07.109 --> 47:10.009
I'm sorry, and I absolutely regret

47:10.011 --> 47:12.011
trying to come out of my way

47:12.013 --> 47:14.814
to come and see you guys, so...

47:14.816 --> 47:16.983
I'm not upset at you.
I'm not upset at you.

47:16.985 --> 47:20.086
I'm just literally
telling you that this...

47:20.088 --> 47:24.057
Plans change. Sorry.
Didn't mean to impose.

47:27.129 --> 47:29.496
I literally don't know what to say.

47:29.498 --> 47:32.632
I'm not interested in arguing with you.

47:32.634 --> 47:34.467
Because I'm not interested in...

47:34.469 --> 47:37.504
I'm sorry that I...

47:37.506 --> 47:40.206
All right. Happy Thanksgiving.

47:43.712 --> 47:48.314
My [bleep] family, dude. I just...

47:50.685 --> 47:52.185
Happy Thanksgiving.

47:52.187 --> 47:54.120
Oh, yeah. Happy Thanksgiving.

47:56.191 --> 47:58.024
Um...

47:59.394 --> 48:01.461
I keep trying to be angry at my family

48:01.463 --> 48:03.997
for being, like, broken,

48:03.999 --> 48:07.233
but I'm having a really
nice Thanksgiving.

48:07.235 --> 48:09.836
Yeah.

48:11.807 --> 48:16.109
You know, ohh...

48:21.783 --> 48:24.050
Man, they look so good.

48:24.052 --> 48:26.019
Dylan, smile with the pies.

48:26.021 --> 48:27.954
1, 2, 3.

48:27.956 --> 48:31.458
Very nice. There you go.

48:36.832 --> 48:37.997
Are those deviled eggs?

48:37.999 --> 48:39.499
Yes. Ohh...

48:39.501 --> 48:41.568
Yeah. Mom... Ha ha ha!

48:41.570 --> 48:44.037
My deviled eggs are very good.

48:44.039 --> 48:45.271
They're my mother's.

48:45.273 --> 48:47.273
Oh, they're beautiful.

48:47.275 --> 48:49.442
Um, yeah.

48:49.444 --> 48:53.847
This one would let me
pretty much do anything.

48:53.849 --> 48:55.748
I mean, I put her in skirts and dresses,

48:55.750 --> 48:58.852
but what I loved was,
she wanted to wear pants,

48:58.854 --> 49:00.887
and that was the funny
thing that I remember.

49:00.889 --> 49:03.690
Her idol was Katherine Hepburn,

49:03.692 --> 49:05.992
and I thought, "I love that.

49:05.994 --> 49:07.727
I just love that."

49:07.729 --> 49:09.829
He said, "I'm gay," and I said,

49:09.831 --> 49:12.098
"Well, of course you are."

49:12.100 --> 49:14.968
I said, "Thank goodness.

49:14.970 --> 49:18.271
I thought you were gonna
tell me you were transgender."

49:18.273 --> 49:20.039
You knew that!

49:20.041 --> 49:22.475
Well, because I watch Oprah,

49:22.477 --> 49:26.412
or did, and...

49:26.414 --> 49:28.481
For me when I came
out, it wasn't like...

49:28.483 --> 49:29.949
I mean, there was a part of me

49:29.951 --> 49:31.284
that was, like, there's that relief

49:31.286 --> 49:32.519
where I was like, "I found it."

49:32.521 --> 49:33.653
"Oh, my God, I know what it is."

49:33.655 --> 49:34.988
Yeah. "I finally found it,"

49:34.990 --> 49:37.056
but then it was almost like

49:37.058 --> 49:40.193
opening a door to nowhere.

49:40.195 --> 49:42.595
There was only work to be done.

49:49.538 --> 49:51.938
The last couple years, I have really

49:51.940 --> 49:53.640
spent trying to find the answers

49:53.642 --> 49:56.442
as to who I am and what that means

49:56.444 --> 49:58.745
and how gender's involved in that,

49:58.747 --> 50:00.813
and now I'm not sure I know

50:00.815 --> 50:02.815
much more than I started with,

50:02.817 --> 50:04.817
but I'm happier,

50:04.819 --> 50:07.387
so I think that means something.

50:18.867 --> 50:21.200
I think for my parents, like,

50:21.202 --> 50:22.735
even at this point,
they want to be like,

50:22.737 --> 50:24.103
"You're great. You're trans.

50:24.105 --> 50:25.939
You're a boy. You're great."

50:25.941 --> 50:27.774
And for me, like, I still have

50:27.776 --> 50:30.677
so much baggage, like, and it's not,

50:30.679 --> 50:32.645
like, bad baggage.

50:32.647 --> 50:34.647
It's just, like, I will need

50:34.649 --> 50:37.617
to do work to, like, heal myself

50:37.619 --> 50:40.520
from how painful this
has been, you know?

50:40.522 --> 50:42.655
Right. I know, and so much of it,

50:42.657 --> 50:44.490
you know, there's, like, the body part,

50:44.492 --> 50:45.892
of course, and then
there's the whole, like,

50:45.894 --> 50:47.927
social and mental and emotional part,

50:47.929 --> 50:51.097
and that's the part that at least people

50:51.099 --> 50:53.833
on the outside don't see a lot.

51:07.582 --> 51:09.749
- You got, like...
- Yeah.

51:09.751 --> 51:12.118
Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha!

51:15.457 --> 51:17.857
Hey, Joe, check out who's working

51:17.859 --> 51:21.427
in the merch department making t-shirts.

51:21.429 --> 51:23.496
- It's my mom.
- Hey there.

51:23.498 --> 51:27.066
Ha ha! Looks good.

51:27.068 --> 51:29.669
See you soon, buddy.

51:29.671 --> 51:33.139
I like to go over it twice just because.

51:33.141 --> 51:35.441
All right, so just pull it up.

51:35.443 --> 51:38.311
Ah, see? I was right there.
