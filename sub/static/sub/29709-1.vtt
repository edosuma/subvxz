WEBVTT

00:22.123 --> 00:27.061
* Waiting for GA today

00:28.296 --> 00:33.567
* Like many men
I can behave *

00:57.658 --> 01:04.298
* So preach from that
mountain slope *

01:04.331 --> 01:09.737
* I'll be on the path below

01:09.770 --> 01:16.610
* But my body stays with GA

01:16.644 --> 01:22.082
* In that quiet place

01:25.353 --> 01:26.687
We should put our
stuff through there.

01:26.720 --> 01:28.222
Yeah, I got it, babe.
I got it.

01:29.490 --> 01:30.524
All right.

01:31.492 --> 01:33.394
[sighs]

01:33.427 --> 01:36.564
Oh, little Sam.

01:36.597 --> 01:37.631
Oh, Sam.

01:37.665 --> 01:38.732
Oh, my God.

01:38.766 --> 01:40.134
Look at that tie.

01:44.738 --> 01:45.773
All right.

02:08.862 --> 02:10.163
[sighs]

02:22.676 --> 02:23.877
Dave called.

02:24.878 --> 02:25.913
And?

02:30.384 --> 02:31.452
Honey, I'm so sorry.

02:36.457 --> 02:37.491
Hey!

02:37.525 --> 02:38.526
Hey!

02:38.559 --> 02:39.593
Great.

02:39.627 --> 02:40.628
Hey!

02:40.661 --> 02:42.796
-Hey! Greta!
-Hey.

02:42.830 --> 02:44.698
-How are you?
-Good. How are you?

02:44.732 --> 02:45.733
Good.

02:45.766 --> 02:47.235
-Good to see you.
-Good to see you!

02:47.268 --> 02:48.536
-Jay!
-Yo, Will, how you doing?

02:48.569 --> 02:50.204
-What's happening, man?
-How're you doing?

02:50.238 --> 02:51.872
Good to see you!
[groans]

02:51.905 --> 02:53.474
Yeah, that's my ribs.

02:53.507 --> 02:54.842
Yeah, working out.

02:54.875 --> 02:56.310
Yeah, I can tell! Look at you!

02:56.344 --> 02:57.511
Yeah, well,
we got a pool, right?

02:57.545 --> 02:58.512
Yeah, we do!

02:58.546 --> 02:59.813
Watch out, ladies!

02:59.847 --> 03:01.282
Ooh, nice.

03:01.315 --> 03:03.317
Can you--
What are you doing?
Why're you--

03:03.351 --> 03:04.885
-No, these are good.
-When did you wash those?

03:04.918 --> 03:06.854
-I haven't washed these yet.
-Not those, your hands!

03:09.923 --> 03:11.659
Whoa, look at this place.
It's amazing!

03:11.692 --> 03:12.693
Yeah.

03:12.726 --> 03:13.694
Whose joint is this again?

03:14.695 --> 03:15.663
Hey!

03:15.696 --> 03:16.597
Hey!

03:16.630 --> 03:17.998
Christopher?

03:18.031 --> 03:19.267
Ah!

03:19.300 --> 03:20.468
Hey, boss, how are you?

03:20.501 --> 03:21.702
Wow. What's going on?

03:21.735 --> 03:23.771
-It's good to see you.
-It's good to see you.

03:24.572 --> 03:25.906
Hey, you sexy chef.

03:25.939 --> 03:29.410
-Hi!
-How are you? Good.

03:29.443 --> 03:31.712
[whispering]
Oh, by the way, don't say
anything about anything.

03:31.745 --> 03:34.448
Um, is he that
ugly lamp guy?

03:34.482 --> 03:35.483
What? No.

03:35.516 --> 03:36.684
Guys, this is Caleb.

03:36.717 --> 03:37.718
Hey.

03:37.751 --> 03:38.819
Hi. Thanks for having me.

03:38.852 --> 03:39.987
Oh, yeah.
No problem.

03:40.020 --> 03:41.789
It's not mine,
but make yourself at home.

03:41.822 --> 03:42.890
Will.

03:51.665 --> 03:54.402
Jaybert! Jay!

03:55.403 --> 03:56.804
Where you at? Yo!

03:56.837 --> 03:57.838
Chrissy!

03:57.871 --> 03:58.972
-Hey!
-How are you?

04:01.509 --> 04:02.776
-How are you?
-I'm good!

04:02.810 --> 04:05.012
-I'm good. How you doing?
-I'm good. I'm great!

04:05.045 --> 04:07.848
Listen, that whole guy thing,
let's not worry about it, okay?

04:07.881 --> 04:09.417
Let's just have
the best weekend ever.

04:09.450 --> 04:10.318
Dude, are you kidding me?

04:10.351 --> 04:12.620
I threw him away like
a parking ticket.

04:12.653 --> 04:13.921
-Where's that from?
-Where's what from?

04:13.954 --> 04:15.956
The parking ticket thing?

04:15.989 --> 04:17.658
I don't know. My brain.

04:17.690 --> 04:19.726
Uh, that's from like
a movie or something.

04:19.760 --> 04:20.793
No! It's not.

04:20.827 --> 04:22.630
I just made it up right now.

04:22.663 --> 04:24.598
-Mmm...
-Eh?

04:24.632 --> 04:25.933
[exclaims dismissively]

04:25.966 --> 04:27.901
Okay, so wait,
if it was from a movie
it would have been funny?

04:27.935 --> 04:28.836
Yes.

04:28.869 --> 04:30.003
-But since I said it, it's not?
-Yup. Yup.

04:30.037 --> 04:32.340
You're an idiot.
Okay, listen.
I brought somebody.

04:32.373 --> 04:33.374
Who'd you bring?

04:33.407 --> 04:34.274
Do you remember Caleb?

04:34.308 --> 04:36.043
-Oh, God, was he
that bartender?
-No.

04:36.076 --> 04:37.845
The... musician?

04:37.878 --> 04:40.314
-No.
-Is he the mountain-man-
furniture-dude?

04:40.348 --> 04:42.115
-Yes, that's the one!
-Dammit! Chris,
why'd you bring him?

04:42.149 --> 04:45.519
Well, listen, I was going
to come up here alone and relax
'cause I needed some alone time

04:45.553 --> 04:48.055
and then I decided I wanted
to get some, and then all you
guys came and crashed.

04:51.459 --> 04:52.760
It's gonna be fun!

04:52.793 --> 04:54.027
He's got a beard.

05:00.067 --> 05:02.002
(laughs)
What is that look for?

05:02.035 --> 05:03.704
This never gets old.

05:03.737 --> 05:04.938
Beaner!

05:04.972 --> 05:05.973
Yes!

05:06.006 --> 05:07.708
-How are you?
-I'm good.

05:07.741 --> 05:09.377
-Good.
-How are you?

05:09.410 --> 05:11.479
-I'm good. Sorry about that.
-No! Don't worry about it.

05:11.512 --> 05:13.080
-I'm good. I'm happy
you guys are here.
-Hi, Chris.

05:13.113 --> 05:14.782
-Hey. You need some help?
-I'm good.

05:21.389 --> 05:22.590
Well, this place
is beautiful.

05:22.623 --> 05:25.693
-Huh? Yeah.
-Oh, man, I tell you, it's...

05:26.927 --> 05:28.662
beautiful.

05:28.696 --> 05:29.963
-Totally.
-Mmm-hmm.

05:37.571 --> 05:39.440
I got to, uh,
go make a call.

05:39.473 --> 05:40.641
Yeah, cool.

05:50.017 --> 05:51.719
-So beautiful.
-Right.

05:55.523 --> 05:56.657
And the mountains.

05:56.690 --> 05:57.758
Yeah.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.028
See that spot right there?

06:01.061 --> 06:03.163
-Right at the peak?
-Mmm.

06:03.196 --> 06:04.798
I want to have
a home right there.

06:04.832 --> 06:07.435
-That would be awesome.
-Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

06:09.002 --> 06:11.972
I mean, isn't that the dream
to have some big old place

06:12.005 --> 06:13.874
at the top of a hill
looking down on everyone?

06:15.509 --> 06:18.779
Well, I mean this place
is pretty amazing.

06:18.812 --> 06:21.549
Yeah! Yeah.
No, this place is awesome.

06:21.582 --> 06:23.116
Yeah.

06:23.150 --> 06:25.185
-It's just that that place...
-That--

06:25.218 --> 06:27.555
-...that would be amazing.
-That would be better.

06:27.588 --> 06:28.822
Yeah.

06:32.860 --> 06:34.862
So you like, you build
things or something?

06:34.895 --> 06:36.964
-Furniture. Yeah.
-Nice. Nice.

06:36.997 --> 06:39.767
Yeah, my old man
was a contractor,
and so I sorta learned from him

06:39.800 --> 06:41.735
but I find I can be more
creative with furniture.

06:41.769 --> 06:44.438
I'm so sorry, did you
just say that your old man
was a contractor?

06:44.472 --> 06:46.607
Mmm-hmm.

06:46.640 --> 06:49.610
-What?
-It's just that-- That's
really amazing because,

06:49.643 --> 06:53.881
I don't know if anyone told you,
but I'm about to open up this
like, amazing restaurant.

06:53.914 --> 06:56.617
It's like, fusion
and modern and stuff.

06:56.650 --> 06:58.986
It's like iPads
and tablets and...

06:59.787 --> 07:00.954
cutting edge.

07:00.988 --> 07:04.625
But, I have yet
to secure a contractor.

07:05.526 --> 07:06.460
Really?

07:06.494 --> 07:07.461
So...

07:08.195 --> 07:10.063
-Caleb...
-Yes?

07:10.097 --> 07:11.799
Would you be my contractor?

07:11.832 --> 07:12.900
[laughing]

07:14.835 --> 07:16.103
I'd have to think about it.

07:20.674 --> 07:25.112
The scary thing is, it feels
like I'm starting to get
used to the rejection--

07:26.146 --> 07:26.880
I know.

07:30.017 --> 07:31.752
Yeah, well, I hope
you're right.

07:33.286 --> 07:34.822
Hmm.

07:34.855 --> 07:36.123
You're wonderful.

07:37.625 --> 07:38.959
I gotta go. Bye.

07:41.261 --> 07:43.063
Hey! Isabella!

07:43.096 --> 07:44.097
Hey, buddy!

07:44.131 --> 07:45.533
-How are you?
-I'm good.

07:45.566 --> 07:47.601
-Good.
-Good to see ya.

07:47.635 --> 07:48.936
-Oh, you, too.
-Yeah.

07:48.969 --> 07:49.970
How are you?

07:50.003 --> 07:51.104
You know...

07:51.138 --> 07:53.173
-Still failing
on a regular basis.
-Hey! Me, too!

07:53.206 --> 07:54.575
Well, that's not what I heard.

07:54.608 --> 07:58.912
I heard you just sold one
for ten thousand dollars,
so that's, uh--

07:58.946 --> 08:01.114
-Yeah.
-That's pretty incredible.

08:01.148 --> 08:02.916
-It's been a good month.
-Yeah.

08:04.985 --> 08:07.287
-Okay, I'm just gonna go, um...
-Yeah! Food!

08:07.320 --> 08:09.256
-...get something to eat.
-Right? Okay.

08:18.932 --> 08:20.167
-Hey.
-Hey.

08:27.240 --> 08:28.709
I can't find
my toothbrush.

08:30.744 --> 08:31.845
Did you pack it?

08:33.581 --> 08:34.648
Oh, shit.

08:40.854 --> 08:43.155
What is this, Samuel Carson?

08:43.190 --> 08:44.792
You weren't
supposed to find that.

08:48.028 --> 08:51.899
Well, it was in an
excellent hiding spot.

08:54.868 --> 08:56.003
Yup.

08:56.904 --> 08:58.071
Right beside my floss.

08:58.105 --> 09:00.007
Genius.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.041
Yeah.

09:02.209 --> 09:04.111
I was going to do it
at Abacus tonight.

09:07.314 --> 09:08.782
Do what exactly?
I'm confused.

09:08.816 --> 09:13.053
I was just gonna get you
to hold that box to see
how big your hands are.

09:13.086 --> 09:14.722
-Oh, that's what this is for?
-Yeah.

09:14.755 --> 09:16.323
Ugh, I always wondered.

09:16.356 --> 09:18.959
Oh, you thought there was
something in the box?

09:18.992 --> 09:21.328
No, no, there's nothing
in the box, it's just this
tiny little green thing

09:21.361 --> 09:24.097
excellent at
measuring hands.

09:24.131 --> 09:27.668
I mean, theoretically there
could be something in the box.

09:27.701 --> 09:30.003
No, you can't backtrack now.
There's nothing inside this box.

09:30.037 --> 09:31.905
-Oh, okay. Never mind.
-Yes please.

09:36.877 --> 09:38.111
[indistinct]

09:38.145 --> 09:39.312
[cheering]

09:39.346 --> 09:42.182
-[all] One! Two! Three!
-Salut!

09:45.753 --> 09:48.756
-Mmm! Beautiful.
-All right, let's see,
let's see.

09:48.789 --> 09:49.657
Okay.

09:49.690 --> 09:51.224
This is like an
engagement party now.

09:51.258 --> 09:52.826
-It's an engagement party!
-Oh, my God!

09:52.860 --> 09:54.628
Not bad, Samuel!

09:54.662 --> 09:56.063
Like you had nothing
to do with it.

09:56.096 --> 09:57.364
Well, maybe I did
and maybe I didn't.

09:57.397 --> 09:59.032
Let's head
into there guys.

09:59.066 --> 10:01.301
-What do you want me to, uh--
-Let's eat! Honey, will you
take these in for me?

10:01.334 --> 10:03.804
Uh, yeah. What--
What do we-- Oh, okay, yeah.

10:03.837 --> 10:05.305
Take that and that.

10:06.206 --> 10:08.676
[indistinct]

10:08.709 --> 10:10.243
Hey, man, I want to
say congratulations.

10:10.277 --> 10:11.912
-Thank you, uh--
-Caleb.

10:11.945 --> 10:13.947
-Right! Right.
Great to meet you, man.
-Likewise.

10:13.981 --> 10:15.315
And thanks letting me
crash at your place, man.

10:15.348 --> 10:18.151
-No, not a problem at all.
-I feel like I might've
imposed now.

10:18.185 --> 10:21.021
Not at all. We're used to it
with her. Don't worry about it.

10:21.054 --> 10:22.089
-Come on, let's eat.
-All right.

10:22.122 --> 10:23.156
[all laughing]

10:24.424 --> 10:25.893
You know what I mean.

10:25.926 --> 10:27.861
[Sam] So, Jay,
what else is new, man?

10:27.895 --> 10:28.829
Oh!

10:28.862 --> 10:31.398
Um, I mean, lots of
really amazing stuff.

10:31.431 --> 10:34.034
-Yeah?
-Um, I don't know
if you guys heard

10:34.067 --> 10:37.838
but I'm gonna open up
a restaurant that will
revolutionize restaurants.

10:37.871 --> 10:39.773
This place is
going to be huge!

10:39.807 --> 10:40.841
No, that sounds great.

10:40.874 --> 10:42.743
What's, uh--
What's the plan?

10:42.776 --> 10:44.745
Um, it's a--

10:44.778 --> 10:48.248
It's modern,
it's fusion,
it's art deco.

10:48.281 --> 10:49.282
-Okay.
-That's new!

10:49.316 --> 10:51.952
It's new.
It's new.

10:51.985 --> 10:54.054
iPads, tablets,
it's going to be digital.

10:54.087 --> 10:55.122
It's gonna be amazing.

10:55.155 --> 10:59.359
Actually, funny enough,
Caleb may come on to do

10:59.392 --> 11:02.195
some contracting work for me,
which is, pretty cool!

11:02.229 --> 11:04.898
Is that right? Okay, but more
important, please tell me
about your dress.

11:04.932 --> 11:07.067
-Oh, no!
-Are you still thinking lace?

11:07.100 --> 11:10.003
Do you remember
when we went on that--

11:10.037 --> 11:12.405
Sometimes you look at it
and you just wanna--
[exclaims dismissively]

11:12.439 --> 11:14.975
No, but please,
you're so classic.

11:15.008 --> 11:17.144
It would be so beautiful
if you wore lace.
I would love it so much.

11:17.177 --> 11:19.312
It would be so beautiful.
It's true, it would be,

11:19.346 --> 11:21.715
but can we talk about
the bridesmaid dresses 'cause
we know that's more important?

11:21.749 --> 11:25.218
Yeah, okay. That is something
I have thought a lot about,
particularly yours, Chris.

11:25.252 --> 11:27.755
Um, okay. Pink.

11:27.788 --> 11:29.089
Lots of ruffles.

11:29.122 --> 11:33.126
-Yes.
-Think Madonna Circa 1982.

11:33.160 --> 11:35.262
-Perfect. Yup.
-Well, the 80's are in,
that's perfect.

11:35.295 --> 11:36.429
-Sam?
-Yes. Please.

11:36.463 --> 11:39.767
So, uh, as I was
saying before...

11:39.800 --> 11:42.335
do you do software development
because there might be an app
involved,

11:42.369 --> 11:44.905
I might need some work on--
Why are you laughing?

11:44.938 --> 11:46.406
Uh... yeah!

11:46.439 --> 11:47.507
Yeah?

11:47.540 --> 11:50.443
I, um-- I could
run it by the guys.

11:50.477 --> 11:52.145
Okay, you're being
way too nice to him.

11:52.179 --> 11:53.747
He's never gonna open
a restaurant, come on.

11:53.781 --> 11:54.915
No, I am. I am.

11:54.948 --> 11:57.217
Are you? Is it gonna be right
next to your T-shirt shop?

11:57.250 --> 11:59.319
Uh, funny you
should say that...

11:59.352 --> 12:02.022
My T-shirts go in
the restaurant still.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.824
To new ideas, Jay.

12:03.857 --> 12:05.392
-Cheers.
-Congratulations.

12:05.425 --> 12:07.360
-To new ideas.
-To new ideas.

12:08.561 --> 12:10.898
New ideas. Cheers, cheers.

12:13.033 --> 12:15.202
I just wish I would
have brought someone.

12:15.235 --> 12:18.238
-[snickering]
-And who would
you have brought?

12:18.271 --> 12:21.341
You know, that's funny,
because lots of women would

12:21.374 --> 12:23.243
have died for the opportunity
to come here with me.

12:23.276 --> 12:24.611
I know they would have.
They would have.

12:24.644 --> 12:26.980
Like Laura?
The, uh, self-proclaimed
actress who turned out to be

12:27.014 --> 12:28.849
a pornstar, remember that?

12:28.882 --> 12:30.550
First of all it was soft-core,
second of all she wasn't
really a star.

12:30.583 --> 12:32.319
I knew that.

12:32.352 --> 12:34.521
What was her name--

12:34.554 --> 12:36.323
-Jenny!
-Oh, Jenny!

12:36.356 --> 12:37.858
Do not speak her name!

12:37.891 --> 12:40.293
Jenny! Wait, she had
the worst laugh. Do her laugh!

12:40.327 --> 12:41.528
[cackling]

12:41.561 --> 12:43.396
-That's it.
-That's really good.

12:43.430 --> 12:45.465
It was like--
[high-pitched laughter]

12:45.498 --> 12:47.500
[Will] I wanted to strangle her.

12:47.534 --> 12:49.536
-[high-pitched] Jay!
-No, it's not--

12:49.569 --> 12:53.006
-Oh, Jay.
-Stop, that's--
That's not how it went.

12:53.040 --> 12:55.542
I know I've been like,
going through a rough patch

12:55.575 --> 12:58.111
-with women and
stuff but like--
-Jay--

12:58.145 --> 13:00.313
You should've seen me
in high school,
I was just killing it.

13:00.347 --> 13:02.983
-"High school?"
Did he say "high school?"
-He said "high school."

13:03.016 --> 13:04.184
What, like eight years ago?

13:04.217 --> 13:06.987
-I wouldn't say you
were killing it.
-I was killing it!

13:07.020 --> 13:09.322
You don't remember
Lauren Silvey with those
big 'ol titties?

13:09.356 --> 13:10.457
Yeah, I remember
Lauren Silvey.

13:10.490 --> 13:12.259
She had big tits,
but she wasn't that hot.

13:12.292 --> 13:13.260
She was hot!

13:13.293 --> 13:15.495
She-- I lost my virginity
to her. She was hot.

13:15.528 --> 13:17.030
I lost my virginity
to Matt Gibson.

13:17.064 --> 13:18.431
Do you remember him?

13:18.465 --> 13:21.168
It was the fourth of July
and we did it in his
Dad's truck. Classy.

13:21.201 --> 13:24.504
-Mmm. Yeah, mine was
Sheila-Anne Davies.
-Three names?

13:24.537 --> 13:28.308
She was the captain
of the swimming team.
Tall... Blonde...

13:29.276 --> 13:32.445
Mine-- Mine was...

13:32.479 --> 13:34.447
-Jeremy White.
-[Beans] Oh, my God.

13:34.481 --> 13:36.884
[Greta] Ugh, Jeremy White.

13:38.518 --> 13:41.521
-I was young, man.
I was like--
-[Beans] You were.

13:41.554 --> 13:42.555
I was like, 13.

13:42.589 --> 13:43.957
-What?
-Yeah.

13:43.991 --> 13:45.058
[Beans] That's a child.

13:45.092 --> 13:48.361
And I was, uh--
I was on my brother's
water bed.

13:48.395 --> 13:50.330
You probably don't know
what a water bed is.

13:50.363 --> 13:53.433
-[Jay] I don't even know
what that is.
-And I'll never forget it.

13:53.466 --> 13:55.869
Baywatch was on
in the background.

13:55.903 --> 13:57.270
[Chris] Uh-oh.

13:57.304 --> 14:00.307
So it was Pam Anderson on
the beach, me and whatever
her name was.

14:00.340 --> 14:02.976
I lasted 33 to 38 seconds.

14:03.010 --> 14:03.877
[all laugh]

14:03.911 --> 14:05.378
-[Greta] Classic Will.
-And I was out.

14:07.114 --> 14:08.148
What about you, Sam?

14:09.149 --> 14:10.650
You're looking at her.

14:10.683 --> 14:12.385
[Caleb] Really?

14:12.419 --> 14:13.921
How long you guys
been together?

14:15.222 --> 14:17.090
Since we were 16.

14:17.124 --> 14:19.059
Whoa!

14:19.092 --> 14:21.361
So you're first and only.

14:21.394 --> 14:24.197
Am I prying right now?
I just feel like--

14:24.231 --> 14:26.399
I'm sorry.
It's just-- It's--

14:26.433 --> 14:30.037
I'm intrigued because
it's, uh--

14:30.070 --> 14:31.972
-It's rare.
-It is rare.

14:32.005 --> 14:34.074
We, uh--

14:34.107 --> 14:36.043
We just got lucky I guess.

14:36.076 --> 14:37.144
[Caleb] Indeed.

14:37.177 --> 14:38.178
[Will] Lucky.

14:39.947 --> 14:41.414
16. That is--

14:41.448 --> 14:43.550
-The age I wanna go back to.
-What?

14:43.583 --> 14:46.053
It was good then, you know?

14:46.086 --> 14:48.922
Everybody always says that,
but if you think about it were
you really that different?

14:48.956 --> 14:50.623
-I was. I know I was.
-[Beans] Yeah, I was.

14:50.657 --> 14:53.626
Come on , you could be
whoever you wanted to be

14:53.660 --> 14:55.695
every day of the week.
You could do anything.

14:55.728 --> 14:58.298
-Yeah.
-Yeah, yeah.

14:58.331 --> 15:01.434
I mean, that's like--
I think that's the hardest
part about being married.

15:03.336 --> 15:07.975
I'm sorry. What's the hardest
part about marriage?

15:08.008 --> 15:10.410
I'm just saying, babe.

15:10.443 --> 15:15.582
You know, the, uh,
the inability to do anything
with the opposite sex.

15:15.615 --> 15:17.550
You can't do anything with
anybody from the opposite sex.

15:17.584 --> 15:20.988
Who have I stopped you
from doing anything with?

15:21.021 --> 15:24.057
-Greta, babe, calm down.
-No.

15:24.091 --> 15:25.225
I'm not talking about you.

15:25.258 --> 15:26.193
Oh! Not your own wife.

15:26.226 --> 15:28.061
-The other marriage?
-Yeah, yes, my other--

15:28.095 --> 15:30.530
-Yeah, your other marriage.
-My other marriage, yeah.

15:30.563 --> 15:32.532
Sam, let's talk about Sam.
Sam for instance.

15:32.565 --> 15:34.667
Sam, we can all agree...

15:34.701 --> 15:36.369
-very good-looking guy.
-Handsome.

15:36.403 --> 15:39.239
-Handsome man over there!
-[Greta] Handsome devil.

15:39.272 --> 15:42.142
If Sam were to meet
a woman, you know,

15:42.175 --> 15:43.977
you're not even
attracted to her let's say.

15:44.011 --> 15:47.047
Let's say you just find
her funny or smart,
witty, whatever.

15:47.080 --> 15:49.582
You can't have a cup
of coffee with her.

15:49.616 --> 15:52.252
You know, you can't have
a meal with her.
You can't go for a walk.

15:52.285 --> 15:55.588
-It's cheating!
-Okay, wait, wait.
He can do that. I don't care.

15:55.622 --> 15:57.657
Yeah right, Beaner.

15:57.690 --> 16:00.393
He can go for dinner with
another lady that's not me?

16:00.427 --> 16:03.263
[Chris] I don't know.
I mean, maybe that's where
cheating comes from, right?

16:03.296 --> 16:06.466
The inability to let
a little pressure out?

16:06.499 --> 16:07.667
You know,
to let a little air out?

16:09.802 --> 16:10.937
Yeah, could be.

16:10.970 --> 16:14.141
I mean, you can't turn off
being attracted to somebody.

16:14.174 --> 16:16.543
You can't pretend that you don't
find somebody interesting.

16:16.576 --> 16:18.378
That's just natural.

16:18.411 --> 16:19.779
You know,
you can't help that.

16:19.812 --> 16:22.549
But you're told not only
can you not touch,

16:22.582 --> 16:25.152
but you can't look
and you can't talk,
so then the pressure builds

16:25.185 --> 16:28.555
and builds and builds
'til it erupts and that,
my friends, is an affair.

16:28.588 --> 16:31.458
I mean, imagine if spouses
allowed their partners,

16:31.491 --> 16:34.327
you know, to let out a little
air every now and then.

16:34.361 --> 16:35.662
-How?
-I don't know.

16:35.695 --> 16:38.798
Maybe a movie,
or a stroll in the park.

16:38.831 --> 16:41.168
Maybe it's a fuck,
I don't know, and then
they come home.

16:42.369 --> 16:43.570
Really?

16:43.603 --> 16:45.338
I'm sorry, but you think that
people would just come home

16:45.372 --> 16:46.706
after they've had a taste
of that freedom?

16:46.739 --> 16:47.974
I do.
I honestly do.

16:48.007 --> 16:50.110
I think that we set the stage
for cheating to be way too easy.

16:50.143 --> 16:51.211
[Greta] What--

16:51.244 --> 16:53.346
The freedom would actually
make it less desirable.

16:56.083 --> 16:57.117
Hmm.

16:57.150 --> 16:59.086
No? Okay.

16:59.119 --> 17:00.487
-I mean, it's an interesting--
-It is.

17:00.520 --> 17:02.755
-Um, the concept is interesting.
-It is.

17:02.789 --> 17:04.290
It's worth a discussion
at least.

17:04.324 --> 17:06.759
Because desire
is what we all want, right?

17:06.792 --> 17:09.262
-From an academic point of view.
-[Chris] Yeah,
you're interested, huh?

17:09.296 --> 17:10.863
-We want that mystery.
-I love you.

17:10.896 --> 17:15.635
And then love, love is obviously
something that we need.
We want that security.

17:15.667 --> 17:19.439
So there's this, sort of,
polarity, you know,

17:19.472 --> 17:22.075
and how do you reconcile
these two differences?

17:22.108 --> 17:25.145
Freedom! That's what I think.
I mean, that's what everybody
wants, right,

17:25.178 --> 17:26.313
a little bit of freedom?

17:26.346 --> 17:28.815
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

17:28.848 --> 17:31.284
Yeah.

17:31.318 --> 17:34.821
This one time I was, uh--
Ah, nah--

17:34.854 --> 17:36.623
-No, Caleb, you can't do that.
-Can't do it.

17:36.656 --> 17:39.192
-Nah, it's just--
I'm that guy now.
-Caleb, Caleb, Caleb.

17:39.226 --> 17:41.161
Don't be that guy, my friend.

17:41.194 --> 17:43.796
-One time, I was having a--
-Listen. Listen.

17:43.830 --> 17:46.533
All new friends here.
Go ahead. Go ahead!

17:46.566 --> 17:51.804
It was this-- I spent a summer
in Copenhagen with these two
friends of mine

17:51.838 --> 17:54.541
that I met at the Burn and--

17:54.574 --> 17:57.210
-[Greta] Uh-- "Met at the burn?"
-Oh, yeah, at the Burn,
the-- I'm sorry.

17:57.244 --> 17:59.479
-The Burning Man Festival.
Have you heard of it?
-[Greta] No.

17:59.512 --> 18:01.348
Yeah, I was supposed
to go last year.

18:01.381 --> 18:02.582
-Really?
-You were gonna come to.

18:02.615 --> 18:03.750
I was supposed to come.
Yeah, I know.

18:03.783 --> 18:05.852
I've been dreaming about
this thing since high school.

18:05.885 --> 18:08.521
You guys-- No, it is so cool.

18:08.555 --> 18:10.890
Basically, you get naked,
you do a bunch of drugs

18:10.923 --> 18:12.759
and then you run around
dancing in the desert.

18:12.792 --> 18:15.228
-Is that how it goes?
-Jay's working up a sweat.

18:15.262 --> 18:16.396
[indistinct]

18:16.429 --> 18:18.265
He's so hot.

18:18.298 --> 18:20.900
[Sam] It's already--
He's getting very
worked up about this.

18:20.933 --> 18:25.472
-Come on , it's perfect!
-That's like--
That is a part of it.

18:25.505 --> 18:27.240
There is like, a larger whole.

18:27.274 --> 18:31.478
You know, like 75,000 people
in the Black Rock Desert.

18:31.511 --> 18:33.646
Like, it's incredible.
For a week.

18:33.680 --> 18:35.215
It's like a whole city.

18:35.248 --> 18:37.584
So, uh, what does
it entail exactly?

18:37.617 --> 18:39.352
Well, there's all
these tenets.

18:39.386 --> 18:43.590
Um, people live by these
rules like, um, you know,

18:43.623 --> 18:45.825
"leave no trace",
everyone packs in and packs out,

18:45.858 --> 18:46.893
they take
care of themselves.

18:46.926 --> 18:50.163
There's this radical
self-expression,

18:50.197 --> 18:52.832
radical self-reliance,
radical inclusion--

18:52.865 --> 18:55.402
Is it like
"totally radical"?

18:55.435 --> 18:56.636
Like, "totally radical"?

18:56.669 --> 18:59.239
It's the most radical
because for that week

18:59.272 --> 19:04.711
you really get to feel like
a child again in the purest
sense of the word.

19:04.744 --> 19:06.779
You get to explore
whatever you want.

19:06.813 --> 19:09.682
You know, you dance however
you want, you costume

19:09.716 --> 19:12.352
yourself in whatever apparel
makes you feel like a king,

19:12.385 --> 19:14.787
you run around and shout
at the top of your lungs

19:14.821 --> 19:17.490
if that's what you wanna do,
and if what you wanna do is

19:17.524 --> 19:21.194
have sex with a consensual
partner then by all means do it.

19:23.530 --> 19:25.198
-That's freedom.
-Yeah. Absolutely.

19:25.232 --> 19:27.267
And these friends of mine,
these Danish girls,

19:27.300 --> 19:29.302
they would take these
tenets and say,

19:29.336 --> 19:31.838
"Well, why can't we apply
them to our life all the time?

19:31.871 --> 19:34.474
"Or at least on
a special occasion?"

19:34.507 --> 19:35.742
We had a lot of fun.

19:37.710 --> 19:38.845
I bet you had some fun.

19:38.878 --> 19:40.380
[all laughing]

19:40.413 --> 19:45.752
No, but it was--
But it's-- It's more than that.

19:57.664 --> 19:58.765
I wanna do it.

20:01.468 --> 20:04.937
I want to have one of those

20:04.971 --> 20:08.608
radical Burning Man
burner night things.

20:08.641 --> 20:09.976
[whispering]
I want a Lamborghini.

20:10.009 --> 20:11.311
[laughing]

20:11.344 --> 20:12.412
Me, too. Me, too.

20:12.445 --> 20:15.415
-[Sam] Honey.
-I want more risotto.

20:15.448 --> 20:16.716
I think you might
be a little drunk.

20:16.749 --> 20:17.817
I'm not drunk.

20:17.850 --> 20:19.252
[Jay] I'm kinda drunk.

20:19.286 --> 20:20.787
-I'm totally drunk.
-I'm definitely drunk.

20:20.820 --> 20:22.955
-I had a shot for the first
time in four years.
-Guys! Guys, I'm serious.

20:22.989 --> 20:24.257
I wanna do it.

20:24.291 --> 20:25.358
Let's do it.

20:25.392 --> 20:26.659
What else are we gonna do?

20:26.693 --> 20:28.361
Fuck it. I'll do it.
Jay'll do it.

20:28.395 --> 20:30.397
I do everything she says.

20:30.430 --> 20:32.699
Obviously I'm game.

20:32.732 --> 20:36.869
Guys! We're not just gonna
throw away all social confines

20:36.903 --> 20:39.639
just to have like a--
I don't know, like some
"Lord of the Flies"

20:39.672 --> 20:40.740
night for yuppies.

20:40.773 --> 20:42.509
Hey!
I am not a yuppie.

20:42.542 --> 20:45.545
Really?
Well, I thought your Tiffany
bracelet says otherwise.

20:45.578 --> 20:46.779
[all laughing]

20:47.780 --> 20:48.815
Guys, guys, guys.

20:48.848 --> 20:50.783
I think my wife
is correct, again.

20:50.817 --> 20:52.719
-[Greta] Yes, thank you.
-We're cool.

20:52.752 --> 20:54.053
Not that cool.

20:54.086 --> 20:56.289
-You might be that cool.
-[Greta] Yes, he is.

20:56.323 --> 20:59.592
So, uh, let's just finish
our wine, maybe,

20:59.626 --> 21:03.630
take a little dip
in the hot tub and
call it a night, yeah?

21:09.101 --> 21:10.303
You're right, Will.

21:11.971 --> 21:13.706
I mean, we probably
will do that.

21:15.675 --> 21:20.647
And then I'll go back
to my expensive loft,

21:20.680 --> 21:23.015
and you'll go back
to your PhD...

21:24.884 --> 21:26.953
and nothing will change.

21:33.560 --> 21:35.962
But what if we
didn't do that.

21:39.699 --> 21:41.033
[Will] Okay.

21:44.471 --> 21:46.072
[Beans chanting softly] Do it.

21:46.105 --> 21:47.874
-Do it.
-Wow.

21:47.907 --> 21:50.042
Do it, do it, do it...

21:50.076 --> 21:51.478
The slow chant!

21:51.511 --> 21:55.047
Do it! Do it! Do it!

21:55.081 --> 22:00.687
Do it! Do it! Do it!
Do it! Do it! Do it!

22:00.720 --> 22:04.524
Okay, there's the line.

22:05.525 --> 22:07.894
And on this side...

22:07.927 --> 22:09.562
whatever we make it.

22:09.596 --> 22:11.798
[music playing]

22:15.702 --> 22:17.437
I thought so.

22:17.470 --> 22:19.606
* Oh, Natalie
the captured wife *

22:22.008 --> 22:26.479
* Every number
is a sign of life *

22:28.415 --> 22:32.619
* So she's watching
as I hit my stride *

22:33.520 --> 22:37.056
* Violent and wide

22:39.792 --> 22:46.666
* Natalie's numbers
are comforts I hide *

22:51.037 --> 22:54.941
* She said that
all of this would pass *

22:58.010 --> 23:01.781
* That ways of living
are a second math *

23:04.517 --> 23:07.887
* All's quiet as she
takes her aim *

23:09.456 --> 23:12.559
* But the weapons have changed

23:15.762 --> 23:21.834
* And Natalie's numbers
are all that remain *

23:30.910 --> 23:32.479
Yes!

23:33.680 --> 23:35.515
All right!

23:35.548 --> 23:38.184
Congratulations, we're all
on this side of the line.

23:38.217 --> 23:39.018
Okay.

23:39.051 --> 23:40.653
-What do we do?
-Whatever we want.

23:40.687 --> 23:43.790
I feel like-- I don't know,
I feel like we should make up
rules or something.

23:43.823 --> 23:44.591
Uh--

23:44.624 --> 23:46.526
Wasn't "no rules"
kinda the point?

23:46.559 --> 23:47.860
Sometimes guidelines
are good, right?

23:47.894 --> 23:49.195
'Cause they make you
feel comfortable.

23:49.228 --> 23:50.229
Thank you.

23:50.262 --> 23:51.664
Okay, well, who should do it?

23:51.698 --> 23:52.932
How about Will and Greta?

23:52.965 --> 23:56.035
Why don't we just--
I mean, we could all
do it together.

23:56.068 --> 23:57.804
I trust you.

23:57.837 --> 23:59.839
No, no...
I trust you.

23:59.872 --> 24:01.974
Yeah, I trust both of you.

24:02.008 --> 24:03.510
We look trustworthy to you?

24:03.543 --> 24:05.778
Yeah.

24:05.812 --> 24:08.748
It's a marriage certificate,
it makes you trustworthy.

24:12.652 --> 24:16.989
* Save the breath that
whistles in my chest *

24:18.858 --> 24:22.562
* And the edges
of a new design *

24:23.896 --> 24:27.934
* Spin in my mind

24:30.136 --> 24:36.576
* With Natalie's numbers
and letters I find *

24:41.013 --> 24:45.117
* Say her name again
and let it rest *

24:47.820 --> 24:51.858
* It will be there
when you need it next *

24:51.891 --> 24:54.026
[all talking indistinctly]

24:56.896 --> 24:58.631
[all] Hey!

25:03.002 --> 25:06.539
And then Caleb said that
clothes mask our beauty.

25:06.573 --> 25:07.974
Can you feel it?

25:08.007 --> 25:11.544
-Beauty.
-Yeah. Sure can.

25:14.346 --> 25:16.015
All right.

25:18.951 --> 25:23.289
I still don't know why
I'm the one who, uh,
has to say all this--

25:23.322 --> 25:24.791
It's because you're
the teacher, sir.

25:24.824 --> 25:26.826
Ah!
Yes, Jay, I am the teacher,

25:26.859 --> 25:29.128
thank you for
reminding me.

25:29.161 --> 25:32.899
So, um, tonight is
about no rules...

25:32.932 --> 25:34.166
right?

25:36.002 --> 25:37.570
So here are some rules.

25:37.604 --> 25:39.171
Okay, well, let's
not call them rules.

25:39.205 --> 25:40.072
Okay.

25:40.106 --> 25:42.341
Uh, I don't know,
how about guidelines?

25:42.374 --> 25:43.743
I don't really
like guidelines.

25:43.776 --> 25:45.311
You don't?
Makes you feel weird?

25:45.344 --> 25:46.312
[Jay] Childhood.

25:46.345 --> 25:48.615
I invite you to follow
these best practices.

25:48.648 --> 25:50.082
-Here-here!
-[Caleb] Well said!

25:51.083 --> 25:53.285
All right.

25:53.319 --> 25:58.791
Well, feel free to, uh,
suggest anything to anyone

25:58.825 --> 26:04.230
just so long as, you know,
you don't make anybody
feel too uncomfortable.

26:04.263 --> 26:06.298
-[softly] What else did
we talk about?
-No drama.

26:06.332 --> 26:07.499
Right. Right.

26:07.533 --> 26:12.271
Emotions are gonna be flying
high, so just... be mindful.

26:12.304 --> 26:14.874
Respect choices
and don't get weird about it.

26:14.907 --> 26:16.075
Yeah. Exactly.

26:16.108 --> 26:21.714
And lastly, um, we talked about
maybe having a word to...

26:21.748 --> 26:25.985
signify if anybody's veering
into uncomfortable territory.

26:26.953 --> 26:28.087
So what's the word?

26:28.120 --> 26:29.155
It could be anything.

26:29.188 --> 26:30.823
-Like, literally anything?
-Mmm-hmm.

26:30.857 --> 26:32.959
Well, how about "fuck"?

26:32.992 --> 26:34.661
[Sam]
That might make things
a little confusing.

26:34.694 --> 26:36.028
-Why? Why is that?
-Maybe a little negative.

26:36.062 --> 26:39.632
-What about "Milwaukee"?
-"Milwaukee"?
Like Milwaukee, Wisconsin?

26:40.332 --> 26:42.268
No. Just--

26:42.301 --> 26:43.836
What Milwaukee?

26:43.870 --> 26:45.738
Yeah, yeah, Milwaukee,
Wisconsin. That's fine.

26:45.772 --> 26:48.074
Okay, let's just let
the fucking word
be Milwaukee.

26:48.107 --> 26:49.341
[Jay] Milwaukee.

26:49.375 --> 26:50.710
All right, Milwaukee.

26:50.743 --> 26:52.278
-Everybody?
-Milwaukee. Yeah.

26:52.311 --> 26:54.881
-All right.
-Anything else, guys?

26:54.914 --> 26:57.049
I just-- I love you guys.

27:04.456 --> 27:07.694
Nah, I don't usually.
But sure.

27:07.727 --> 27:08.928
I don't usually either.

27:08.961 --> 27:11.330
No, trust me, I'm on
Neptune when I'm high.

27:11.363 --> 27:12.732
It's okay.
She's not looking.

27:12.765 --> 27:13.933
You're funny.

27:17.837 --> 27:19.305
What are we doing?

27:19.338 --> 27:20.707
I don't know.

27:22.374 --> 27:25.945
You know, part of me likes
to be the guy...

27:25.978 --> 27:27.546
who would do
something like this,

27:27.579 --> 27:31.918
as opposed to the guy
who's now standing naked
with another dude doing this.

27:31.951 --> 27:36.055
-Yeah, what actually is this?
-Freedom.

27:36.088 --> 27:36.989
I guess.
I don't know.

27:37.023 --> 27:38.925
Isn't that what the wizard
said in there?

27:41.994 --> 27:44.196
You'll see, man.
It's different, you know.

27:46.132 --> 27:48.234
Marriage is
different, you know.

27:48.267 --> 27:50.870
I don't care how long
you've been with the girl.

27:50.903 --> 27:52.304
It doesn't matter.

27:52.338 --> 27:55.107
It changes.

27:55.141 --> 27:57.710
The morning you wake up
and you're married,
everything changes,

27:57.744 --> 27:58.878
you know?

27:58.911 --> 28:04.150
I have to make a decision,
every day... every morning...

28:04.183 --> 28:09.922
I wake up, I have to decide
again to be married.

28:11.357 --> 28:13.893
You know, sometimes you just
need something, anything,

28:13.926 --> 28:16.428
to make it feel like
it's not a prison.

28:16.462 --> 28:18.330
Prison?

28:18.364 --> 28:20.366
Thanks.
Glad I just signed up.

28:22.101 --> 28:24.003
Oh, man.

28:24.036 --> 28:25.237
Nah, man, sometimes
it's great.

28:25.271 --> 28:29.475
Listen, sometimes it's great,
sometimes it fucking sucks.

28:29.508 --> 28:31.277
I'll be honest.

28:31.310 --> 28:33.345
Right?

28:33.379 --> 28:37.850
Sometimes I wonder...
if God or whatever
is looking down on us

28:37.884 --> 28:40.252
and he's saying, "Idiots.

28:41.821 --> 28:43.856
"What are you doin'?

28:43.890 --> 28:45.291
"You're not supposed
to be with one person.

28:45.324 --> 28:47.794
"I tried to show you
that in this generation.

28:47.827 --> 28:50.963
"I tried to show you that
in the previous generation
and the previous generation.

28:50.997 --> 28:54.066
"You guys don't listen
'cause it's--"
You know, it doesn't work.

28:57.069 --> 28:58.204
I don't know.

28:59.939 --> 29:01.507
I like having one person.

29:01.540 --> 29:03.109
-You know? It's--
-Yeah.

29:05.211 --> 29:06.312
It's home.

29:06.345 --> 29:08.014
Uh-huh.

29:08.047 --> 29:08.948
Wait. Hold on.

29:08.981 --> 29:10.549
I don't want to go
back in there just yet.

29:10.582 --> 29:11.350
Yeah? Okay.

29:11.383 --> 29:13.119
-I'll stay here, buddy.
-Thanks.

29:15.187 --> 29:16.856
[music playing]

30:56.622 --> 30:58.324
[plane flying by]

30:58.357 --> 30:59.658
Cessna.

30:59.691 --> 31:01.093
Single engine.

31:03.629 --> 31:04.863
How'd you know that?

31:05.631 --> 31:07.266
I can fly.

31:10.569 --> 31:12.571
I believe you can fly.

31:12.604 --> 31:14.506
[both laughing]

31:18.344 --> 31:22.181
I don't much anymore,
but I used to.

31:23.249 --> 31:25.384
My dad taught me
a lot about flying.

31:29.588 --> 31:32.058
I believe you can
touch the sky.

31:32.091 --> 31:34.326
[both laughing]

31:39.031 --> 31:39.999
Wow.

31:44.536 --> 31:46.038
You're so pretty.

32:04.356 --> 32:05.958
Are you wearing chapstick?

32:07.226 --> 32:08.961
It's just Vaseline
Cocoa Butter.

32:10.529 --> 32:14.200
-You find that funny? Thank you.
-Tastes good.

32:19.405 --> 32:23.042
You have such
a cute little nose.

32:23.075 --> 32:26.412
So then I get home
like eight hours later,
and there's just--

32:26.445 --> 32:28.180
I don't know,
some weird structure that

32:28.214 --> 32:30.582
did not at all resemble
a bookshelf waiting.

32:30.616 --> 32:32.484
It's because
Ikea's the worst.

32:32.518 --> 32:34.053
You're better
building from scratch.

32:34.086 --> 32:35.421
-No.
-Every time.

32:35.454 --> 32:38.424
No, you would not want to see
Will without instructions.
Trust me.

32:38.457 --> 32:41.427
Well, you think that,
but I actually teach this class
for senior citizens.

32:41.460 --> 32:42.461
Really?

32:42.494 --> 32:44.363
I, um, I work at
a seniors home.

32:45.564 --> 32:46.999
-No.
-I do.

32:47.033 --> 32:48.500
-Really?
-Mmm-hmm.

32:48.534 --> 32:50.369
Yeah! I teach a wood
chopping class.

32:50.402 --> 32:52.204
I was supposed to come in
and teach them how to build

32:52.238 --> 32:54.440
like a table or a, um,
bird house or whatever,

32:54.473 --> 32:56.008
but they didn't wanna know.

32:56.042 --> 32:57.443
So we just threw
out the rules.

32:57.476 --> 32:59.745
Gave 'em the tools,
let 'em go nuts, you know?

32:59.778 --> 33:02.281
It's kinda cool to see
what they come up with.

33:02.314 --> 33:03.315
Wow.

33:03.349 --> 33:06.152
It's uh-- I love them.

33:06.185 --> 33:07.586
Me, too.

33:07.619 --> 33:10.556
I actually think I was
born to be an old person.

33:10.589 --> 33:12.358
[laughs] I was!

33:12.391 --> 33:14.460
I know it sounds stupid.
People were born to be doctors.

33:14.493 --> 33:15.727
I was born to be old.

33:15.761 --> 33:18.430
-Born to be an old?
-I was born to be a geriatric!
I was!

33:19.531 --> 33:22.434
I don't know, I just--
I love them.

33:22.468 --> 33:23.569
They're so...

33:24.703 --> 33:25.737
honest.

33:25.771 --> 33:26.738
Yes.

33:28.340 --> 33:30.576
You will not get a false
compliment out of them.

33:34.280 --> 33:35.414
You're beautiful, Greta.

33:37.249 --> 33:38.717
No, I'm not.

33:55.601 --> 33:57.636
I've wanted to do
this for so long.

34:08.880 --> 34:12.083
Uh, uh-- You don't have to.

34:13.518 --> 34:14.753
I want to.

34:16.755 --> 34:18.190
It's just--

34:19.791 --> 34:21.693
I don't really like that.

34:33.304 --> 34:34.739
Um...

34:34.773 --> 34:35.841
Jay.

34:36.775 --> 34:37.775
Jay.

34:41.413 --> 34:42.714
You don't want to?

34:45.317 --> 34:46.752
Uh, I don't know.

34:55.726 --> 34:58.130
I mean, that's what this
whole thing is about, right?

34:58.164 --> 34:59.298
Yeah.

35:02.768 --> 35:03.835
Okay.

35:05.204 --> 35:06.705
Okay, yeah, let's do it.

35:11.377 --> 35:15.247
-Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.
-Is it in?

35:15.281 --> 35:16.415
Yeah.

35:33.832 --> 35:35.767
Oh, sorry.

35:35.801 --> 35:37.636
You did that with
very little effort.

35:37.669 --> 35:40.506
You have very strong arms.

35:40.539 --> 35:41.807
You like that?

35:41.840 --> 35:43.675
Are you talking
dirty to me?

35:43.709 --> 35:45.477
Not yet.
But I can if you want.

35:51.517 --> 35:54.453
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

35:54.486 --> 35:58.357
I feel like-- I don't know.
I feel like I want to scream.

35:58.390 --> 36:03.295
In a good way! You're just
this rugged stranger--

36:12.271 --> 36:13.305
Oh, my God.

36:13.339 --> 36:14.373
You okay?

36:23.515 --> 36:24.716
Can we go outside?

36:24.750 --> 36:25.951
-Outside?
-Yeah.

36:31.290 --> 36:33.459
Sorry, I don't know
why I said outside.

36:33.492 --> 36:34.793
You just seem
really outdoorsy.

36:34.826 --> 36:36.462
[panting]

36:37.863 --> 36:39.231
I'm sorry.

36:39.265 --> 36:40.699
Jay, it's fine.

36:40.732 --> 36:42.668
That's never happened
to me before.

36:42.701 --> 36:44.670
Jay, it's okay.

36:45.771 --> 36:47.473
I usually go for hours.

37:00.286 --> 37:01.620
Wanna get a drink?

37:02.988 --> 37:04.690
I'll meet you out there.

37:05.724 --> 37:06.758
Okay.

37:21.807 --> 37:22.741
[sighs]

37:42.027 --> 37:44.763
Is it okay if
this is all we do?

37:44.796 --> 37:46.932
Of course. Yeah.

38:04.516 --> 38:05.984
-Yep.
-Yeah.

38:06.017 --> 38:07.419
That's the stuff right there.

38:07.453 --> 38:08.387
Yeah.

38:08.420 --> 38:09.988
Yeah, you're fun.

38:20.999 --> 38:22.468
I, uh--

38:25.003 --> 38:26.672
I should go.

38:26.705 --> 38:27.739
Yeah.

39:02.441 --> 39:03.609
[exhales deeply]

39:18.690 --> 39:19.825
[sighs deeply]

39:23.962 --> 39:26.632
-There you are.
-Hey, mama.

39:29.701 --> 39:31.069
-Can I have one of those?
-Yeah.

39:34.506 --> 39:35.641
You having fun?

39:36.742 --> 39:38.043
Oh, yes.

39:38.076 --> 39:39.545
Yeah?

39:47.085 --> 39:48.554
Where were you?

39:50.856 --> 39:52.057
With Jay.

39:52.991 --> 39:54.893
Like, with Jay?

39:58.597 --> 39:59.765
Wow.

40:02.901 --> 40:03.969
And--

40:09.475 --> 40:10.709
Hey.

40:10.742 --> 40:11.910
It's just me.

40:13.879 --> 40:15.681
It's okay.
You can tell me.

40:17.616 --> 40:18.784
How was it?

40:21.887 --> 40:23.154
Not Sam.

40:27.659 --> 40:29.695
I guess I've done it.

40:29.728 --> 40:32.430
I've finally slept with
someone other than Sam.

40:40.238 --> 40:41.907
How do you feel?

40:47.913 --> 40:49.147
I feel--

40:54.586 --> 40:56.054
I feel...

40:58.524 --> 40:59.691
liberated.

41:09.601 --> 41:10.636
I don't care
what anybody says.

41:10.669 --> 41:12.971
There is nothing like
a new set of hands on you.

41:31.156 --> 41:32.190
Okay.

41:33.592 --> 41:35.561
Well, you must be
feeling liberated.

41:42.934 --> 41:44.903
You know, Chris...

41:46.705 --> 41:48.707
I, um--

41:53.779 --> 41:55.013
I don't know.

41:57.315 --> 42:01.987
I've always felt like...
it wouldn't matter,

42:03.221 --> 42:05.557
if it was a guy or a girl.

42:05.591 --> 42:06.825
Physically.

42:09.828 --> 42:13.064
Fuck, if I loved them,
it wouldn't matter.

42:18.069 --> 42:19.671
That's really beautiful.

42:23.241 --> 42:25.577
I just really like penis.

42:25.611 --> 42:27.846
[laughing] Yeah, you do.

42:35.286 --> 42:36.822
But for my sake...

42:37.989 --> 42:38.957
again?

42:41.760 --> 42:43.328
Hey!

42:43.361 --> 42:46.698
Didn't know you guys were
being lesbians without me.

42:46.732 --> 42:50.702
Yeah, actually we were about
to go to second base before
you came and messed things up.

42:50.736 --> 42:52.170
-Just ruined it.
-Oh.

42:52.203 --> 42:54.105
I'm sorry, were you
gonna touch her boobs?

42:54.139 --> 42:56.642
Yes, of course I was.
Look at them they're great.

42:56.675 --> 42:58.143
Well, they are great.
They are great.

42:58.176 --> 43:01.279
Stop, guys, I still wear
training bras for girls.

43:01.312 --> 43:04.850
So I'm 10 years old,
watching girls in skirts
play baseball.

43:04.883 --> 43:08.119
Like, so many emotions
running through my body.

43:08.153 --> 43:09.755
I was playing little league
at the time,

43:09.788 --> 43:13.859
so I was obsessed and Tom Hanks
is killing it with every line.
There's no crying!

43:13.892 --> 43:15.761
Are you crying?
There's no crying in baseball!

43:15.794 --> 43:19.030
So I'm laughing and there's
Madonna and Gena Davis,

43:19.064 --> 43:21.332
they're having a cat fight.
So I have a raging hard-on

43:21.366 --> 43:23.735
before I even knew
what a hard-on was.

43:23.769 --> 43:25.270
I became a man that day.

43:27.272 --> 43:29.207
What day?

43:29.240 --> 43:31.376
The day I saw
"League of Their Own".

43:32.443 --> 43:33.712
Never seen it.

43:33.745 --> 43:35.413
-What?
-Dude, that is genius.

43:35.446 --> 43:36.982
There are so many
good people in it.

43:37.015 --> 43:38.216
So many.

43:38.249 --> 43:39.651
Um, Rosie O'Donnell.

43:39.685 --> 43:41.152
And that guy
from "Twister".

43:41.186 --> 43:42.688
Who's that again?

43:42.721 --> 43:45.123
-Um, uh, Bill Pullman.
-No.

43:45.156 --> 43:46.692
Bill Pullman, yeah!
He's the guy--

43:46.725 --> 43:48.426
He's Dottie's husband
in "A League of Their Own".

43:48.459 --> 43:49.327
Yeah, he is.

43:49.360 --> 43:52.063
But Bill Paxton
is the guy in "Twister".

43:52.097 --> 43:53.398
They're the same guy.

43:54.700 --> 43:56.067
No, it's not.

43:57.402 --> 43:58.704
Wait. What?

43:58.737 --> 44:00.939
Oh, this is a big
moment for you.

44:00.972 --> 44:02.107
What moment?

44:02.140 --> 44:06.244
This is the moment where
you boys realize Bill Pullman

44:06.277 --> 44:09.414
and Bill Paxton
are two different people.

44:10.281 --> 44:11.282
Not possible.

44:11.316 --> 44:13.184
Okay. Wait.

44:13.218 --> 44:15.220
So who's the president
in Independence Day?

44:15.253 --> 44:16.922
Who do you think?

44:16.955 --> 44:18.423
-Pullman!
-Paxton!

44:18.456 --> 44:21.059
-Pullman.
-Yes! Yes! Fuck!

44:21.092 --> 44:24.295
-Can I ask you
guys something weird?
-Yes... Uh-oh.

44:26.131 --> 44:27.899
Have you guys ever
given a footie?

44:27.933 --> 44:28.934
I have.

44:28.967 --> 44:30.235
-What?
-Yeah.

44:30.268 --> 44:32.103
What is a footie?

44:32.137 --> 44:33.839
-It's that!
She's doing a footie.
-You put your feet like this...

44:33.872 --> 44:37.308
-Will asked me to do a footie
and I was like why the shit...
-Just lube it right up.

44:37.342 --> 44:41.179
-...would I put my feet
near your sexual parts?
-Get right in there.

44:41.212 --> 44:43.214
You know it's funny,
because um,

44:43.248 --> 44:47.018
I first gave tongue to Carol
McCarthy watching "Twister".

44:47.052 --> 44:48.754
How was it?

44:48.787 --> 44:50.188
-I tore it up.
-Nice.

44:50.221 --> 44:51.256
You know how I do.

44:51.289 --> 44:52.724
-I believe that.
-Uh-huh.

44:52.758 --> 44:55.794
Honestly, some of my best
sexual encounters were
my grade school ones.

44:55.827 --> 44:57.228
They were just so good.

44:57.262 --> 44:58.997
Yeah, 'cause it's all new.
It's so new.

44:59.030 --> 45:01.933
And because you think every
girl is gonna be the girl.

45:01.967 --> 45:03.068
[both] Mmm-hmm.

45:03.101 --> 45:07.839
And then when you get the girl,
you really think...

45:07.873 --> 45:10.175
she's "the girl".

45:10.208 --> 45:11.943
-You see what I'm saying?
-Puberty.

45:11.977 --> 45:13.278
That's what I call it.

45:14.780 --> 45:16.047
Puberty Jay.

45:16.081 --> 45:18.283
-That was the best Jay.
-It wasn't the best Will.

45:18.316 --> 45:19.317
No?

45:19.350 --> 45:20.986
No, I was so emotional.

45:21.019 --> 45:22.320
I took everything
so personally.

45:22.353 --> 45:26.992
I wanted to buy every girl
ice cream and pull out
every chair,

45:27.025 --> 45:29.828
I could not get any sex.

45:29.861 --> 45:31.296
Yeah, that's not gonna work.

45:31.329 --> 45:33.364
And then in college
I was angry.

45:33.398 --> 45:36.434
So I just wrote all the time,
smoked a lot of weed.

45:37.502 --> 45:38.503
Called girls names.

45:38.536 --> 45:39.871
"Get outta here, slut."

45:39.905 --> 45:41.206
"Suck my dick, bitch."

45:41.239 --> 45:43.241
And I got a lot of the sex.

45:43.274 --> 45:45.010
See the--

45:45.043 --> 45:47.345
-I get it.
-Yeah.

45:47.378 --> 45:49.815
They are complicated
creatures, ya?

45:49.848 --> 45:51.349
Not complicated, my friend.

45:52.250 --> 45:53.418
Fucked up.

45:56.587 --> 45:57.889
Oh, yeah!

45:57.923 --> 45:58.824
Oh, yeah!

46:00.458 --> 46:02.160
That's a good move.
That's not a good angle.

46:02.193 --> 46:03.829
Hey, Will!
Will get over here.

46:03.862 --> 46:05.797
Shed some light on a--

46:05.831 --> 46:08.333
On a subject
over here for us.

46:08.366 --> 46:10.068
Hey, wife.

46:10.101 --> 46:12.537
-Husband!
-How are ya?

46:12.570 --> 46:18.243
So, uh, small breasts
versus massive boobs?

46:19.410 --> 46:20.879
An age-old question.

46:20.912 --> 46:22.981
Age-old.

46:23.014 --> 46:25.483
God made them both,
so who am I to judge?

46:26.284 --> 46:27.285
Helpful.

46:27.318 --> 46:28.954
-Very diplomatic.
-Right?

46:28.987 --> 46:31.189
-I've learned from
living with her.
-Yeah, wise man.

46:31.222 --> 46:32.723
Always.

46:32.757 --> 46:36.261
You can't go one way
or another too hard or else
I get it from this one.

46:36.294 --> 46:38.463
-Yeah, guess what
else you missed?
-Uh-huh?

46:38.496 --> 46:41.366
A little girl-on-girl
action over here.

46:41.399 --> 46:42.400
What?

46:42.433 --> 46:45.236
See that--
Now, I'm a little upset.

46:45.270 --> 46:46.137
I wish I saw that.

46:46.171 --> 46:48.940
Yeah, I bet you're sad
you missed that .

46:52.143 --> 46:55.280
You know, uh,
Will's always had a little
thing for you, Chris.

46:55.313 --> 46:57.115
[Beans exclaiming]

46:57.148 --> 46:58.349
Excuse me.

46:58.383 --> 46:59.885
Excuse me, ma'am.

46:59.918 --> 47:01.252
Uh, yes, there.

47:02.453 --> 47:05.056
-What? It's fine!
-Where'd that come from?

47:05.090 --> 47:07.192
What, I'm not an idiot.
I mean...

47:07.225 --> 47:10.295
she's like a super cool dude in
the body of a really hot woman.

47:11.362 --> 47:12.864
All right.
All right.

47:12.898 --> 47:15.100
Chris, no offense, but I don't
think it would work.

47:15.133 --> 47:18.269
You can probably throw
a football 100 yards
further than I could.

47:18.303 --> 47:19.938
-So...
-[Chris] That's true.

47:19.971 --> 47:21.272
-I'll take that.
-[Will] Yeah.

47:21.306 --> 47:24.409
Yes, I'm sure she could,
but I'm just saying I know

47:24.442 --> 47:26.577
that you find it sexy
she can drink more
whiskey than you can.

47:27.512 --> 47:28.880
All right, babe.

47:28.914 --> 47:32.383
What? You know what?

47:33.952 --> 47:35.020
You should kiss her.

47:36.454 --> 47:37.889
You should!

47:37.923 --> 47:41.492
I mean, if you're gonna
kiss another woman,
I should know about it.

47:41.526 --> 47:42.928
Greta.

47:42.961 --> 47:44.162
What? I'm a big girl.
I can handle it.

47:44.195 --> 47:45.430
Greta, that's enough.

47:51.302 --> 47:53.104
I've always
known who was who.

47:53.138 --> 47:54.639
Just wanted to see
that unfold.

47:54.672 --> 47:57.008
Yeah, it's a big moment.

47:57.042 --> 47:59.978
You know, I wasn't really
into this whole idea at first,

48:00.011 --> 48:03.414
but I don't know,
I'm having fun.

48:03.448 --> 48:05.083
-Thanks.
-Someones coming around.

48:05.116 --> 48:06.952
Thank you, man.
It's your place.

48:06.985 --> 48:08.519
Thanks again for having me.

48:08.553 --> 48:11.556
And really, thank you so much,
Sam, for letting me experience
that with Beans.

48:11.589 --> 48:12.657
It was so special for me.

48:14.359 --> 48:15.493
What?

48:15.526 --> 48:17.929
I think it's really gonna
help me move on from my crush.

48:19.630 --> 48:20.898
Wait. What is?

48:21.632 --> 48:24.135
Wait, what is what?

48:24.169 --> 48:26.537
What's going to help you
move on from your crush?

48:28.473 --> 48:29.640
Being with Beans.

48:31.442 --> 48:32.677
Being with her how?

48:33.744 --> 48:35.113
Come on, Sammy.

48:38.149 --> 48:40.151
[Jay] Dude, Milwaukee.

48:42.387 --> 48:43.721
Oh, right there?

48:43.754 --> 48:45.323
Ow!

48:45.356 --> 48:47.458
I swear, he's never hit
anybody in his whole life.

48:47.492 --> 48:49.260
It doesn't feel like he's
never hit anyone before.

48:49.294 --> 48:52.130
He was lightning fast.

48:52.163 --> 48:54.599
I'm sorry I broke some stuff.
I'm really, really sorry.

48:55.500 --> 48:56.467
It's okay.

48:56.501 --> 48:57.935
Will you get him some ice?

49:02.440 --> 49:03.574
Look at me.

49:09.614 --> 49:11.182
Fucking look at me.

49:19.090 --> 49:23.394
You could have chosen to do
as much or as little as you
wanted tonight...

49:25.730 --> 49:28.033
and you jump right in
and have sex with someone?

49:31.069 --> 49:32.570
What are you
trying to do to us?

49:35.073 --> 49:36.207
Nothing.

49:38.109 --> 49:40.445
Nothing. I'm not trying
to do anything to us.

49:42.147 --> 49:44.582
I'm on this
side of the line...

49:44.615 --> 49:49.220
and I gave into a feeling
without thinking about it.

49:49.254 --> 49:52.423
-Because that's what
we're allowed to do.
-And just wham!

49:54.692 --> 49:56.727
Right into bed with
the first guy who asked?

49:56.761 --> 49:58.329
He didn't ask.

50:02.533 --> 50:03.534
Great.

50:05.770 --> 50:07.072
Sam--

50:08.373 --> 50:10.608
Sam, I said yes...

50:11.676 --> 50:12.677
to you.

50:14.212 --> 50:17.182
To you for the rest of my life.

50:21.552 --> 50:23.188
Can you give me
this one night?

50:28.193 --> 50:29.627
You know, tonight...

50:30.661 --> 50:32.029
is yours, too.

50:34.399 --> 50:38.336
But it's not about
keeping score,
or feeling threatened,

50:38.369 --> 50:40.505
or destroying
something sacred.

50:40.538 --> 50:43.174
-You know this is harder for me
than it is for you.
-I know.

50:43.208 --> 50:44.275
-You know that.
-I know that.

50:45.876 --> 50:47.712
But I'm not turning
my back on you.

50:49.347 --> 50:51.249
I promise.

50:51.282 --> 50:53.251
I'm not turning
my back on you.

50:54.652 --> 50:56.221
I promise.

51:00.891 --> 51:02.193
I need this.

51:13.338 --> 51:15.806
All right, listen.

51:15.840 --> 51:18.543
We all made a choice to do
something tonight...

51:20.345 --> 51:22.413
and now we have to live
with that choice.

51:25.183 --> 51:31.088
Now the easy answer is we all
get in our cars and drive off...

51:32.223 --> 51:33.824
and we never
talk about this again.

51:36.294 --> 51:39.430
Or we can have some
fucking conviction
and fucking sort it out.

51:39.464 --> 51:41.332
It's whatever anyone's
comfortable with.

51:41.366 --> 51:42.900
Yeah, you see I would
argue the opposite.

51:42.933 --> 51:46.871
I would argue that sometimes
you have to force yourself

51:46.904 --> 51:48.606
to be uncomfortable
in order to grow.

51:50.575 --> 51:54.345
Now you asked me to step across
the line tonight, and I did it.

51:54.379 --> 51:55.380
I didn't want to.

51:56.314 --> 51:57.782
But I did.
It was the choice that I made.

51:57.815 --> 51:59.584
You made the same choice, Sam.

52:00.618 --> 52:01.652
I know I did.

52:03.388 --> 52:04.622
Now I would feel like a fraud...

52:06.391 --> 52:08.226
if I step back across
that line.

52:08.259 --> 52:11.229
Honey, this is just--
It's turning into some
"Big Chill" nightmare.

52:11.262 --> 52:12.563
[Will] Yeah, but it
doesn't have to.

52:15.700 --> 52:16.801
What do we do?

52:19.537 --> 52:20.538
I don't know.

52:22.573 --> 52:23.874
I'm going to read something.

52:25.576 --> 52:28.246
-You're gonna read something?
-Mmm-hmm. I'm gonna read a poem.

52:29.380 --> 52:32.317
A poem that I keep
in my wallet.

52:33.318 --> 52:34.785
By Charles Bukowski.

52:34.819 --> 52:37.288
And after I read the poem
my hope is that we--

52:39.557 --> 52:41.826
We all keep the promises
that we made to one another.

52:53.404 --> 52:56.474
"Your life is your life

52:58.643 --> 53:01.212
"Don't let it be clubbed
into dank submission

53:03.348 --> 53:04.782
"Be on the watch

53:06.016 --> 53:07.918
"There are ways out

53:09.687 --> 53:11.689
"There is a light somewhere

53:13.591 --> 53:15.926
"It may not be much light
but it beats the darkness

53:18.496 --> 53:19.497
"Be on the watch--"

53:19.530 --> 53:20.565
Fireworks!

53:20.598 --> 53:22.333
[fireworks bursting]

53:25.803 --> 53:27.538
[music playing]

55:14.111 --> 55:15.913
So Caleb, huh?

55:17.915 --> 55:18.949
Yeah.

55:18.983 --> 55:20.317
Interesting guy.

55:22.653 --> 55:24.389
Yeah, it lasted
for about a minute.

55:24.422 --> 55:25.456
Mmm-hmm.

55:25.490 --> 55:26.657
I'm already bored.

55:28.158 --> 55:30.395
You know, whatever I found
cute and charming about him

55:30.428 --> 55:33.631
at the beginning
is... already gone.

55:34.765 --> 55:35.833
Yeah.

55:35.866 --> 55:36.901
Yeah.

55:40.838 --> 55:42.373
I don't have
a thing for you.

55:44.008 --> 55:45.109
For the record.

55:47.545 --> 55:48.679
Okay.

55:49.847 --> 55:51.449
-Don't be mad.
-I'm not.

55:53.851 --> 55:56.020
I'm not insulted
or anything. It's cool.

55:56.053 --> 55:59.657
See now, you gotta--
You gotta make sure
you can back that up

55:59.690 --> 56:01.125
'cause that's a little
aggressive.

56:01.158 --> 56:02.627
-Oh, I can back it up.
-Yeah?

56:02.660 --> 56:03.794
-I can back it up.
-Yeah?

56:03.828 --> 56:04.962
Oh, you-- Oh!

56:04.995 --> 56:06.230
See, you gotta be
quicker than that.

56:06.263 --> 56:08.466
-Oh, it's getting
real now, is it? Okay.
-All right, Rocky.

56:08.499 --> 56:10.134
Put 'em up.
I'm not gonna hold back.

56:10.167 --> 56:12.670
-No? All right, lemme
see what you got.
-No.

56:12.703 --> 56:13.771
Okay.

56:13.804 --> 56:15.105
Okay!

56:15.139 --> 56:16.741
Okay.

56:16.774 --> 56:17.742
Okay!

56:30.988 --> 56:32.590
Hey, hey, hey!

56:34.759 --> 56:35.760
Sorry.

56:35.793 --> 56:37.194
-You okay?
-Yeah. I'm good.

56:37.227 --> 56:38.496
Hey.

56:38.529 --> 56:39.530
I'm good.

56:39.564 --> 56:40.565
I'm good.

56:41.699 --> 56:43.000
You're gonna be fine.

56:44.234 --> 56:45.803
You're gonna be fine.

56:47.872 --> 56:49.607
Yeah? How about you?

57:09.594 --> 57:10.728
[both laughing]

57:19.203 --> 57:20.805
-I owe you one.
-Oh, yeah?

57:20.838 --> 57:22.640
Yeah, let's have some fun.

57:23.708 --> 57:25.109
Go, go, go, go, go!

57:29.279 --> 57:30.581
Hey, slugger!

57:31.782 --> 57:33.217
Thought I might find you here.

57:41.592 --> 57:42.960
Quite the night.

57:42.993 --> 57:43.961
Yeah.

57:46.964 --> 57:52.770
You know, the last time
I was here, we were playing
Peter Pan and Tinkerbell.

57:54.004 --> 57:56.006
But I probably made
you be Tinkerbell.

57:56.040 --> 57:57.975
You probably did.

57:58.008 --> 57:58.976
Sorry.

58:00.945 --> 58:02.246
I remember those guys.

58:03.681 --> 58:04.682
I know.

58:06.016 --> 58:08.553
-I was obsessed with them.
-Yes, you were.

58:10.588 --> 58:12.089
You know, they weren't
allowed out of my room.

58:14.191 --> 58:15.225
How messed up is that?

58:15.259 --> 58:19.664
As a parent, to not let
a kid's toy leave a room.

58:19.697 --> 58:22.767
I thought you were just really
anal about where you kept them.

58:22.800 --> 58:26.971
I had one hour after dinner that
I was allowed to play with them

58:27.004 --> 58:28.973
and only in my room.

58:30.841 --> 58:32.543
Your mom was always
pretty uptight.

58:32.577 --> 58:34.011
Was?

58:34.044 --> 58:36.113
She still is the
consummate dictator.

58:42.720 --> 58:46.223
I used to take them out
when everyone was asleep.

58:46.256 --> 58:48.793
Like 3:00 in the morning,

58:48.826 --> 58:53.698
and I would show them
all the different rooms
in the house.

58:56.166 --> 58:59.637
I felt bad they didn't
ever get to see anything
but one room.

59:03.007 --> 59:05.042
You're gonna make
a really good husband, Sam.

59:10.014 --> 59:11.315
[Will] Watch out for the door.

59:11.348 --> 59:12.817
[Chris] Shut up.

59:12.850 --> 59:13.951
[yelps]

59:26.163 --> 59:27.765
Is that tape?
Yo, what are you doing?

59:27.798 --> 59:28.799
We're going to war!

59:28.833 --> 59:31.001
Come on. Grab a pillow!

59:31.035 --> 59:32.036
War?

59:32.069 --> 59:33.070
War.

59:33.103 --> 59:34.772
All right.

59:34.805 --> 59:37.174
-You want some of this?
-Here, give me that, here.

59:37.207 --> 59:38.876
Jaybert!

59:38.909 --> 59:41.011
Where you at?
I'm coming for you!

59:45.683 --> 59:46.984
Whatcha doing here?

59:50.755 --> 59:52.156
I don't know.

59:53.357 --> 59:54.725
Mmm-hmm.

59:56.794 --> 59:57.928
I like that.

59:58.963 --> 01:00:00.297
-Thanks.
-Is that your only one?

01:00:01.431 --> 01:00:02.733
Nope.

01:00:04.869 --> 01:00:07.137
You have like
20 secret ones?

01:00:08.072 --> 01:00:09.173
No!

01:00:10.407 --> 01:00:12.176
Whoops.

01:00:12.209 --> 01:00:14.111
May I see for real?

01:00:14.144 --> 01:00:15.112
Yeah.

01:00:18.816 --> 01:00:21.318
I'm not gonna lie, that
looks very rudimentary.

01:00:21.351 --> 01:00:23.087
It is very rudimentary.

01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:24.354
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

01:00:24.388 --> 01:00:25.690
I'm kinda jealous.

01:00:27.291 --> 01:00:28.859
You don't have any?

01:00:28.893 --> 01:00:31.862
Mmm-mmm. No, I'm sorta
scared of commitment,
I think.

01:00:33.964 --> 01:00:35.733
And the body is
a temple, of course.

01:00:36.901 --> 01:00:38.202
Mmm-hmm.

01:00:51.415 --> 01:00:53.183
Do you want one?

01:00:53.217 --> 01:00:54.318
Yeah.

01:00:55.419 --> 01:00:58.222
Yes, on my scapula, please.

01:00:58.255 --> 01:00:59.356
Copy that.

01:01:06.897 --> 01:01:08.365
Are you a good drawer?

01:01:08.398 --> 01:01:09.433
Mmm-hmm.

01:01:11.869 --> 01:01:14.404
Should've asked before
you got started.

01:01:21.011 --> 01:01:23.814
My best friend from
childhood gave me mine.

01:01:24.949 --> 01:01:28.052
Lotta whiskey and a needle.

01:01:33.290 --> 01:01:34.759
It was kind of
a messy night.

01:01:35.893 --> 01:01:36.961
I bet.

01:01:36.994 --> 01:01:38.395
In a good way.

01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:44.401
I know those nights.

01:01:48.005 --> 01:01:51.241
You know the next morning
I woke up feeling...

01:01:53.878 --> 01:01:55.079
guilty.

01:02:01.218 --> 01:02:02.787
I felt like shit.

01:02:08.959 --> 01:02:10.427
I hid it from Sam.

01:02:12.863 --> 01:02:14.932
Was he pissed when
he saw it finally?

01:02:20.204 --> 01:02:21.939
No.

01:02:21.972 --> 01:02:23.774
You know what,
he really wasn't.

01:02:26.176 --> 01:02:30.080
It's funny how we let
our minds create something

01:02:30.114 --> 01:02:33.217
greater than...
what's actually there.

01:02:36.987 --> 01:02:38.222
Do you do that?

01:02:38.255 --> 01:02:39.523
Yeah.

01:02:41.291 --> 01:02:46.864
I bet you have that disease.
That... terrible affliction.

01:02:46.897 --> 01:02:48.365
That sort of awful--

01:02:52.569 --> 01:02:54.872
That sort of awful
affliction--

01:02:57.574 --> 01:03:00.477
I think it's called
being human?

01:03:08.118 --> 01:03:09.586
[both exclaiming]

01:03:09.619 --> 01:03:11.421
What are you doing over here,
you little pervert?
What are you doing?

01:03:11.455 --> 01:03:13.257
-You're jerking off
in front of them?
-What? Stop it!

01:03:17.161 --> 01:03:19.563
What the hell?

01:03:19.596 --> 01:03:23.267
I don't wanna always act
like a fucking infant
for your entertainment!

01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:26.570
Are you mad just 'cause you only
lasted ten seconds with your new
little girlfriend?

01:03:26.603 --> 01:03:28.939
She's not my
girlfriend, okay?
She's not.

01:03:28.973 --> 01:03:31.275
She's Sam's fucking fiancÃ©e.

01:03:31.308 --> 01:03:33.477
Dude, are you
serious right now?

01:03:33.510 --> 01:03:34.544
Milwaukee.

01:03:35.479 --> 01:03:36.914
Fuck, Milwaukee.

01:03:44.388 --> 01:03:45.956
Do you believe in past-lives?

01:03:48.125 --> 01:03:49.994
-In past-lives!
-Mmm-hmm.

01:03:53.297 --> 01:03:54.464
Yeah.

01:04:00.905 --> 01:04:02.206
Do you think--

01:04:07.411 --> 01:04:10.247
Do you think maybe we knew
each other in a past life?

01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:12.082
I don't know,
go like this.

01:04:12.116 --> 01:04:13.350
Oh, yeah, totally!

01:04:16.286 --> 01:04:17.421
It's possible.

01:04:17.454 --> 01:04:18.422
It's conceivable.

01:04:19.589 --> 01:04:20.590
Might even be probable.

01:04:22.692 --> 01:04:24.861
Why, do you think you'd
kill me in a past-life?

01:04:26.096 --> 01:04:27.297
Probably.

01:04:33.403 --> 01:04:34.404
Yeah.

01:04:37.207 --> 01:04:38.375
Would explain it.

01:04:42.579 --> 01:04:43.914
[panting]

01:05:35.465 --> 01:05:36.666
Babe.

01:05:38.202 --> 01:05:39.436
Hey!

01:05:39.469 --> 01:05:40.737
Are you cleaning again?

01:05:40.770 --> 01:05:42.939
You gotta stop cleaning,
we're having fun.

01:05:48.412 --> 01:05:50.414
You and Chris sounded like
you were having fun.

01:05:50.447 --> 01:05:52.616
Yeah.
Chris is great.

01:05:52.649 --> 01:05:54.418
She is. She's a nut,
but she's great.

01:05:54.451 --> 01:05:57.687
And then Jay fell
in the pool and babe,
he was so mad.

01:05:57.721 --> 01:06:01.258
-Jay's either really
upset or really happy.
-Honey...

01:06:03.660 --> 01:06:05.695
you used to have fun
with me, too, right?

01:06:09.133 --> 01:06:10.967
What does that
even mean, Greta?

01:06:12.036 --> 01:06:14.038
What is that?

01:06:14.071 --> 01:06:18.008
Greta, what is all this
stuff tonight with Chris?

01:06:21.111 --> 01:06:22.246
Really?

01:06:25.549 --> 01:06:26.583
All right.

01:06:29.286 --> 01:06:33.757
There's something
about... tonight...

01:06:37.227 --> 01:06:39.229
that made me think about--

01:06:41.731 --> 01:06:43.433
About being free.

01:06:43.467 --> 01:06:45.635
You know being
really, really free.

01:06:48.505 --> 01:06:51.141
So I wanna tell you something.

01:06:56.546 --> 01:07:01.385
Can you, um--
Will you hold my hands?

01:07:04.154 --> 01:07:07.191
My mom told me that you
should fight holding hands.

01:07:07.224 --> 01:07:10.227
That you can only be so mad
at someone whose hands you're
willing to hold.

01:07:18.502 --> 01:07:19.703
Okay.

01:07:23.873 --> 01:07:25.642
A few months ago...

01:07:30.180 --> 01:07:32.449
when you were at your parents.

01:07:35.419 --> 01:07:36.786
I, um--

01:07:40.790 --> 01:07:42.759
I spent the night
with one of my TA's.

01:07:44.694 --> 01:07:46.130
I'm so sorry.

01:07:49.633 --> 01:07:51.201
-Just once?
-Just the one time.

01:07:51.235 --> 01:07:53.537
Ah, fuck, Will.
Please stop.

01:07:53.570 --> 01:07:54.771
Greta, what?
Why are you--

01:07:54.804 --> 01:07:56.173
You've already made
a fool out of me.

01:07:56.206 --> 01:07:57.441
Don't call me
stupid on top of it.

01:07:57.474 --> 01:07:59.809
I know that you've been
fucking her for the three
months.

01:08:03.413 --> 01:08:05.482
Did you call her after
your bad news today?

01:08:06.850 --> 01:08:08.885
Did she comfort you?

01:08:08.918 --> 01:08:11.155
How much fucking coddling
can one man need?

01:08:13.557 --> 01:08:16.526
Beans heard you on the phone.

01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:18.462
Fuck, you couldn't
wait a weekend?

01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:22.832
Look, Greta--

01:08:22.866 --> 01:08:27.304
I'm sorry, did you think that
this would make you
the good guy?

01:08:27.337 --> 01:08:28.772
Alleviate your guilt somehow?

01:08:28.805 --> 01:08:31.475
Because you cannot believe
that I didn't already know.

01:08:31.508 --> 01:08:33.210
Greta, listen, I'm trying
to be honest with you.

01:08:33.243 --> 01:08:35.645
[scoffs] Honest?

01:08:35.679 --> 01:08:38.448
-Is it hard?
-Yeah, it's fucking hard, Greta.

01:08:38.482 --> 01:08:39.683
It's fucking hard.

01:08:43.787 --> 01:08:45.622
I hate you.

01:08:45.654 --> 01:08:47.224
I hate this.

01:08:48.425 --> 01:08:50.194
I hate-- I hate it.

01:08:52.895 --> 01:08:55.465
Well, I love you,
so what are we gonna do?

01:09:01.904 --> 01:09:03.506
I, uh--

01:09:06.410 --> 01:09:08.245
I kissed Caleb tonight.

01:09:10.580 --> 01:09:12.782
I kissed him a lot.

01:09:14.984 --> 01:09:21.225
I thought, maybe it would
even the playing field

01:09:21.258 --> 01:09:24.828
or make me feel
vindicated but--

01:09:27.231 --> 01:09:31.701
It didn't.
You know what it did?

01:09:33.903 --> 01:09:35.738
It made me
realize something.

01:09:38.608 --> 01:09:41.645
I don't want to get
even with you.

01:09:44.913 --> 01:09:47.783
I want nothing... with you.

01:10:01.531 --> 01:10:03.267
[somber music playing]

01:10:54.884 --> 01:10:58.722
[sighing] You know,
pretty much the entire
planet collectively

01:10:58.755 --> 01:11:01.525
represses the urge to do
what we had the balls to
make happen tonight.

01:11:02.826 --> 01:11:04.594
Do you believe yourself
when you speak?

01:11:04.628 --> 01:11:07.297
Or is there just this little
voice in your head

01:11:07.331 --> 01:11:08.998
that constantly tells you
that you're full of shit?

01:11:10.967 --> 01:11:12.536
Okay.

01:11:12.569 --> 01:11:14.338
-Milwaukee.
-Don't say it.
I don't want to hear it.

01:11:15.405 --> 01:11:17.541
Oh, Sam.

01:11:17.574 --> 01:11:20.377
You can't see it right now,
but I promise you

01:11:20.410 --> 01:11:21.978
tonight is going to help
you in the long run.

01:11:25.114 --> 01:11:29.719
You know, if you took
yourself half as seriously

01:11:29.753 --> 01:11:32.055
as people take you,
you might let someone in

01:11:32.088 --> 01:11:35.792
long enough to realize
that partner swapping
like a bunch of bored,

01:11:35.825 --> 01:11:39.996
perverted suburbanites
isn't really the path
to a healthy relationship.

01:11:40.029 --> 01:11:43.099
I'm sorry, Sam, what did
you think tonight was gonna be?

01:11:43.132 --> 01:11:46.503
Let's see. I was going to take
my girlfriend to the best
restaurant in the city.

01:11:46.536 --> 01:11:48.438
But instead I turned
my vacation home

01:11:48.472 --> 01:11:51.408
into Coachella,
where my fiancÃ©e of two hours

01:11:51.441 --> 01:11:52.976
was to then fuck
one of my friends.

01:11:54.644 --> 01:11:56.079
You're telling me that
there's no part of you

01:11:56.112 --> 01:11:57.514
that was excited
about tonight?

01:11:58.782 --> 01:12:03.086
Believe it or not, not every
single guy thinks with his dick

01:12:03.119 --> 01:12:06.523
and pounces on what's
in front of him like
a goddamn nature documentary.

01:12:06.556 --> 01:12:09.759
One, congratulations on
being a fucking unicorn.
What's that like?

01:12:09.793 --> 01:12:11.661
Two, that won't last, Sam.

01:12:11.695 --> 01:12:15.665
You're in this juvenile,
pre-wedding,
the world is perfect coma,

01:12:15.699 --> 01:12:17.467
so just wake up
and stop pretending.

01:12:17.501 --> 01:12:18.835
Pretending what?

01:12:18.868 --> 01:12:20.003
Pretending that you
and Beans live in this
perfect little world

01:12:20.036 --> 01:12:22.372
-and you never want
to fuck anyone else!
-Fuck off.

01:12:22.406 --> 01:12:23.507
[scoffs]

01:12:24.508 --> 01:12:27.977
I mean, clearly
Beans wanted to.

01:12:28.011 --> 01:12:30.580
She wanted to fuck somebody
before she sealed the deal
with you for life.

01:12:32.115 --> 01:12:34.718
At least she's
being honest about it.

01:12:34.751 --> 01:12:36.720
You're walking around here
with this stupid fucking,

01:12:36.753 --> 01:12:39.055
"I'm a perfect boyfriend" mask
on your stupid fucking face.

01:12:39.088 --> 01:12:41.891
I'm so tired of you and your
jaded fuckin' attitude.

01:12:43.126 --> 01:12:44.828
I'm not jaded.

01:12:44.861 --> 01:12:46.396
-I'm realistic.
-You're fucking sad.

01:12:46.430 --> 01:12:47.931
You're fucking sad, Chris.

01:12:47.964 --> 01:12:50.066
You know which couples
are the most likely to cheat?

01:12:50.099 --> 01:12:51.435
Gay men.

01:12:51.468 --> 01:12:53.437
And then, men
in straight couples.

01:12:53.470 --> 01:12:54.971
And the least likely to cheat?

01:12:55.004 --> 01:12:56.540
Gay women.
What does that tell you?

01:12:59.075 --> 01:13:01.645
Guys fucking cheat!

01:13:01.678 --> 01:13:03.747
-Not me.
-[scoffs]

01:13:03.780 --> 01:13:06.516
You're telling me four years
away at Yale you never
fucked around on Beans once?

01:13:06.550 --> 01:13:07.617
-No, I didn't.
-Bullshit.

01:13:07.651 --> 01:13:10.520
You fucking know I didn't.

01:13:10.554 --> 01:13:12.889
And that doesn't mean that
I never thought about
being with other women,

01:13:12.922 --> 01:13:14.458
it just means I never
went through with it.

01:13:15.659 --> 01:13:16.626
Congratulations.

01:13:16.660 --> 01:13:18.161
No. That weekend that you
were in New Haven--

01:13:18.194 --> 01:13:19.696
Don't fucking bring that
weekend up.

01:13:19.729 --> 01:13:21.164
-You don't think I wanted to?
-Clearly you didn't.

01:13:21.197 --> 01:13:22.799
-I did. I did!
-No, you didn't!

01:13:22.832 --> 01:13:25.034
If you wanted to fuck me,
you would have fucked me.
You had me naked on your bed.

01:13:25.068 --> 01:13:26.770
[music playing]

01:14:01.805 --> 01:14:03.473
[breathing heavily]

01:14:05.241 --> 01:14:07.010
Take them off,
take them off.

01:14:14.851 --> 01:14:15.885
Fuck.

01:14:15.919 --> 01:14:17.487
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

01:14:18.187 --> 01:14:20.890
Fuck.

01:14:20.924 --> 01:14:22.859
We shouldn't do this.
Yeah, I'm fucking serious.

01:14:28.998 --> 01:14:30.333
You were right, Sam.

01:14:34.203 --> 01:14:35.572
You were right.

01:15:05.134 --> 01:15:06.603
Hey.

01:15:06.636 --> 01:15:07.704
Hey.

01:15:07.737 --> 01:15:09.272
You had to get out
of there too, huh?

01:15:17.781 --> 01:15:18.948
This cant be it.

01:15:20.083 --> 01:15:21.217
Can't be what?

01:15:21.250 --> 01:15:23.720
There's, uh--

01:15:23.753 --> 01:15:25.655
There's gotta be
something better.

01:15:28.725 --> 01:15:29.826
Better than what, Will?

01:15:31.961 --> 01:15:33.229
Marriage.

01:15:33.262 --> 01:15:36.065
Monogamy.
All this crap.

01:15:36.099 --> 01:15:40.069
Yeah, and open relationships
obviously don't work either.

01:15:40.103 --> 01:15:43.707
My throbbing forehead is
the perfect example of that.

01:15:45.108 --> 01:15:46.676
Oh, man.

01:15:48.144 --> 01:15:49.779
Polygamy doesn't work.

01:15:49.813 --> 01:15:51.047
Monogamy doesn't work.

01:15:53.216 --> 01:15:54.618
What the fuck works?

01:15:57.120 --> 01:15:59.723
Maybe this is as
good as it gets.

01:15:59.756 --> 01:16:02.992
You know, I'm always
striving for something
better and better and better.

01:16:04.961 --> 01:16:06.730
But maybe there
is no better.

01:16:09.232 --> 01:16:10.900
Maybe there is no better.

01:16:12.068 --> 01:16:14.738
Yeah, sometimes
there is, right?
I mean...

01:16:14.771 --> 01:16:16.773
what kinda phone you're
dealing with, am I right?

01:16:17.406 --> 01:16:19.108
Yeah. Yeah.

01:16:19.142 --> 01:16:22.345
But I don't know. Some things,
they've just stopped improving.

01:16:24.047 --> 01:16:25.281
Hmm. Like what?

01:16:28.818 --> 01:16:29.786
I don't know.

01:16:31.254 --> 01:16:32.255
A level.

01:16:32.288 --> 01:16:33.156
A level?

01:16:33.189 --> 01:16:34.824
I mean what the fuck
is a level, right?

01:16:34.858 --> 01:16:36.960
It's a bubble in some liquid
and that bubble--

01:16:36.993 --> 01:16:39.996
That's been telling us
if things are straight for like
a hundred years.

01:16:40.029 --> 01:16:41.931
People haven't found
a better way to figure out

01:16:41.965 --> 01:16:43.132
if something's straight or not.

01:16:43.166 --> 01:16:44.300
Well, there's other ways.

01:16:46.736 --> 01:16:47.937
Yeah.

01:16:47.971 --> 01:16:50.606
But people still use levels.

01:16:51.875 --> 01:16:52.942
I hear you.

01:16:55.244 --> 01:16:58.915
I'm walking across the most
massive suspension bridge

01:16:58.948 --> 01:17:03.186
somewhere in Argentina
or Peru...

01:17:04.988 --> 01:17:06.022
the Inca trail!

01:17:06.055 --> 01:17:07.190
That's Peru, right?

01:17:08.124 --> 01:17:09.125
Yeah.

01:17:10.860 --> 01:17:12.729
There are mountains
everywhere.

01:17:13.730 --> 01:17:14.831
Lots of trees.

01:17:16.299 --> 01:17:17.667
Water underneath.

01:17:17.701 --> 01:17:20.136
Rocks in the water.

01:17:20.169 --> 01:17:26.109
The air is so thick,
it's like a leaf milkshake.

01:17:29.846 --> 01:17:33.182
I'm standing in the middle,
taking it all in when
it happens.

01:17:33.216 --> 01:17:35.351
Suddenly the bridge just snaps.

01:17:35.384 --> 01:17:38.822
Breaks in half and I fall
for a long time.

01:17:38.855 --> 01:17:40.890
Long enough that
it feels like I'm flying.

01:17:42.792 --> 01:17:44.728
And then I hit the bottom.

01:17:44.761 --> 01:17:48.331
The water and the rocks break
my bones and my mind is quiet.

01:17:49.498 --> 01:17:51.167
And I am gone.

01:17:56.272 --> 01:17:57.707
Jesus.

01:18:02.979 --> 01:18:04.247
You.

01:18:08.051 --> 01:18:09.719
I am...

01:18:10.519 --> 01:18:11.821
in my shop...

01:18:13.322 --> 01:18:14.623
and I'm old.

01:18:14.657 --> 01:18:18.962
I'm like, really old.
Face full of wrinkles
and thick glasses.

01:18:21.264 --> 01:18:25.401
Neil Young's playing
in the background as
I'm making like a chair.

01:18:25.434 --> 01:18:28.471
My last unfinished piece.

01:18:31.374 --> 01:18:34.110
And I have this glorious
piece of walnut with all

01:18:34.143 --> 01:18:38.047
these knots and grooves and--
You know, the kind of piece

01:18:38.081 --> 01:18:40.850
that you run your hand over
and you think,
"Oh, this is perfection."

01:18:44.220 --> 01:18:47.924
And I trip on that same
stupid piece of concrete...

01:18:51.995 --> 01:18:55.298
and the circ-saw is running,
of course, and I trip.

01:18:57.867 --> 01:19:00.003
I try to regain my balance,
you know...

01:19:02.438 --> 01:19:03.439
but I'm too rickety,

01:19:03.472 --> 01:19:07.376
I'm too old, my bones are
too frail and I fall.

01:19:10.313 --> 01:19:12.415
Catch the circ-saw
right where it counts,

01:19:12.448 --> 01:19:14.550
it cuts my head clean off.

01:19:18.421 --> 01:19:20.156
Sure, that's worth
every penny...

01:19:23.492 --> 01:19:29.098
but he walls of my shed are...
splattered in this glorious red.

01:19:35.038 --> 01:19:36.439
You're not well
in the brain.

01:19:39.976 --> 01:19:42.045
Takes one to know one.

01:19:45.281 --> 01:19:46.449
What's your real name?

01:19:48.151 --> 01:19:49.318
Isabella.

01:19:50.386 --> 01:19:51.855
Isabella.

01:19:52.922 --> 01:19:53.890
Mmm.

01:19:56.359 --> 01:19:57.526
I like that.

01:20:10.306 --> 01:20:12.208
[sighs] There you are.

01:20:15.444 --> 01:20:17.046
You read my mind.

01:20:21.384 --> 01:20:23.219
How's your eye doing?

01:20:23.252 --> 01:20:24.320
Smoking this.

01:20:26.322 --> 01:20:27.456
Does it hurt?

01:20:28.357 --> 01:20:29.825
Yeah.

01:20:29.859 --> 01:20:33.196
Not quite as bas
as the time you punched me
in the third grade, you bitch.

01:20:33.229 --> 01:20:34.630
Yeah, well, you deserved that.

01:20:34.663 --> 01:20:36.900
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

01:20:36.933 --> 01:20:39.535
I like it though.
It makes you look tough.

01:20:39.568 --> 01:20:41.004
-Really?
-Yeah.

01:20:50.479 --> 01:20:55.584
Listen, Jay, I'm sorry
about what I said by the pool.

01:20:58.487 --> 01:21:01.024
I shouldn't have
teased you about that.

01:21:01.057 --> 01:21:02.358
It's okay.

01:21:05.194 --> 01:21:06.462
You're my girl.

01:21:08.297 --> 01:21:10.967
It's not okay, though.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.236
It was insensitive...

01:21:13.269 --> 01:21:15.404
and mean,
and I'm sorry.

01:21:26.950 --> 01:21:28.217
[sighs deeply]

01:21:38.261 --> 01:21:40.363
Did I ever tell you that
Spencer Connelly cheated on me?

01:21:40.396 --> 01:21:42.966
Are you kidding me?
He was like the nicest guy.

01:21:42.999 --> 01:21:44.467
Yeah, he was
the nicest guy.

01:21:45.969 --> 01:21:47.136
Who'd he cheat
on you with?

01:21:49.338 --> 01:21:50.473
Alison McGee.

01:21:50.506 --> 01:21:51.975
[chuckles]

01:21:55.744 --> 01:21:58.381
Yeah. It was our
three month anniversary.

01:22:01.650 --> 01:22:03.119
I'm sorry, Chris.

01:22:03.152 --> 01:22:04.320
No, it's okay.

01:22:05.454 --> 01:22:08.257
Honestly, I wasn't even mad.

01:22:08.291 --> 01:22:11.060
I remember thinking that
it must have been my fault.

01:22:11.094 --> 01:22:13.029
You know?

01:22:13.062 --> 01:22:14.663
'Cause I wanted to
wait to have sex.

01:22:18.201 --> 01:22:20.236
I mean, whatever,
we were 16.

01:22:20.269 --> 01:22:23.339
How is a 16-year-old guy
supposed to resist a hot girl
like Alison McGee?

01:22:23.372 --> 01:22:24.974
She was fucking hot.

01:22:26.075 --> 01:22:27.476
She was fucking hot.

01:22:29.145 --> 01:22:30.279
[sighs]

01:22:39.255 --> 01:22:40.556
The, uh--

01:22:42.558 --> 01:22:44.493
The guy I was
seeing in March...

01:22:46.629 --> 01:22:48.131
he was married.

01:22:54.770 --> 01:22:58.207
This one time I was
blowing him in his car
and his fucking kids car seats

01:22:58.241 --> 01:22:59.508
were in the back.

01:23:02.411 --> 01:23:03.746
But whatever,
it's on him, right?

01:23:03.779 --> 01:23:05.581
He's the one who's
married not me.

01:23:34.643 --> 01:23:37.613
You know, I'm really
starting to hate myself.

01:23:50.626 --> 01:23:52.295
I don't hate you.

01:23:52.328 --> 01:23:54.130
You should hate me.

01:23:59.302 --> 01:24:00.603
I don't.

01:24:01.804 --> 01:24:03.506
I love you.

01:24:05.108 --> 01:24:06.642
You're my family.

01:24:10.613 --> 01:24:12.081
I love you, too.

01:24:24.260 --> 01:24:25.761
That was really
fucking weird.

01:24:25.794 --> 01:24:28.297
Yeah, that didn't feel good.

01:24:28.331 --> 01:24:29.865
Ugh!

01:24:29.898 --> 01:24:31.834
Sorry. I'm sorry.

01:24:55.891 --> 01:24:57.460
What are you doing?

01:24:59.595 --> 01:25:01.597
I don't remember.

01:25:04.767 --> 01:25:07.170
I do that all the time.

01:25:07.203 --> 01:25:09.738
I'll be doing something that
I've done a thousand times

01:25:09.772 --> 01:25:11.574
and then all of a sudden
I just won't be there.

01:25:11.607 --> 01:25:15.678
I mean, I'll be there,
but I'll just be running
through the motions.

01:25:18.481 --> 01:25:20.383
Doesn't happen to me
when I'm cooking though.

01:25:24.420 --> 01:25:25.854
You hungry?

01:25:25.888 --> 01:25:27.323
I'm always hungry.

01:25:28.924 --> 01:25:30.826
You wanna make me something?

01:25:30.859 --> 01:25:32.127
Nah.

01:25:32.795 --> 01:25:34.230
'Course I do.

01:25:34.263 --> 01:25:37.933
Um, I'm guessing these
are the pots and pans?

01:25:37.966 --> 01:25:40.169
These will be those!
Yeah.

01:25:40.203 --> 01:25:41.770
[indistinct]

01:26:37.526 --> 01:26:38.961
[inaudible]

01:27:18.901 --> 01:27:19.802
Hi.

01:27:21.304 --> 01:27:21.970
Hi.

01:27:23.939 --> 01:27:24.940
How's the swim?

01:27:24.973 --> 01:27:27.743
Oh, it's excellent.

01:27:32.615 --> 01:27:33.816
You okay?

01:27:36.452 --> 01:27:37.686
Mmm...

01:27:38.854 --> 01:27:39.988
I don't know.

01:27:41.957 --> 01:27:43.326
What does that mean?

01:27:48.797 --> 01:27:50.533
[exclaiming]

01:27:53.001 --> 01:27:54.570
I feel funny right now, Sam.

01:27:58.607 --> 01:28:00.876
Why won't you tell me
what's in your head?

01:28:05.848 --> 01:28:06.949
You afraid?

01:28:16.492 --> 01:28:17.593
Probably.

01:28:20.463 --> 01:28:23.065
I know.

01:28:23.098 --> 01:28:27.670
It's stuff I'm almost
certain I'm not supposed
to say out loud.

01:28:28.604 --> 01:28:30.038
I'm asking you to.

01:28:37.145 --> 01:28:41.450
I think--
I think about running away...

01:28:43.719 --> 01:28:46.455
about once a week.

01:28:53.028 --> 01:28:56.665
I have these thoughts,
I don't know whether
or not to trust.

01:28:58.534 --> 01:29:00.536
And every time I allow
myself to go there,

01:29:00.569 --> 01:29:03.338
I'm also certain
that I want you.

01:29:07.476 --> 01:29:08.644
-You're beautiful.
-No, I'm not.

01:29:08.677 --> 01:29:10.413
I'm not fucking beautiful.
I'm ugly.

01:29:10.446 --> 01:29:12.981
Okay.
You're right.
You're ugly.

01:29:13.015 --> 01:29:14.950
You're really, really ugly.

01:29:14.983 --> 01:29:16.585
You're ugly.

01:29:28.764 --> 01:29:33.068
Iz... I love our life.

01:29:35.504 --> 01:29:38.574
We can explore anything we want,

01:29:38.607 --> 01:29:43.946
we can have everything we want,
and still have us.

01:29:58.527 --> 01:30:00.062
I'm a maniac, Sam.

01:30:02.831 --> 01:30:04.132
Can you live with that?

01:30:05.668 --> 01:30:07.536
I want to live
with all of that.

01:30:11.807 --> 01:30:12.875
Hey.

01:30:14.577 --> 01:30:15.678
Hey.

01:30:16.979 --> 01:30:18.113
You doing okay?

01:30:19.682 --> 01:30:20.783
Yeah.

01:30:23.919 --> 01:30:25.420
Did I mess anything up?

01:30:26.955 --> 01:30:28.657
No.

01:30:28.691 --> 01:30:30.659
No, you didn't
mess up anything.

01:30:46.709 --> 01:30:48.143
Where did you get that?

01:30:48.176 --> 01:30:50.145
I found it in your room.
I really like it.

01:30:50.178 --> 01:30:51.747
I don't wanna take it off.

01:30:55.918 --> 01:30:56.919
I'm sorry, dude.

01:30:59.755 --> 01:31:00.856
It's okay.

01:31:01.890 --> 01:31:03.125
Are you guys good?

01:31:04.159 --> 01:31:05.227
Yeah.

01:31:08.230 --> 01:31:09.698
I'd marry him
right now if I could.

01:31:13.836 --> 01:31:16.772
Well, It's not the wedding
I dreamed of when I was seven.

01:31:16.805 --> 01:31:18.807
But, it's pretty great.

01:31:18.841 --> 01:31:20.943
Did you ever imagine this?

01:31:20.976 --> 01:31:22.745
[laughing] No.

01:31:22.778 --> 01:31:24.346
Short answer. No.

01:31:24.379 --> 01:31:27.249
-I can't believe they still
have all this stuff.
-I think you look kinda hot!

01:31:27.282 --> 01:31:29.051
Do a 360 immediately.
Of course you do.

01:31:29.084 --> 01:31:30.919
What time's the audition?

01:31:31.854 --> 01:31:32.921
For what?

01:31:35.991 --> 01:31:37.092
Wow.

01:31:37.125 --> 01:31:38.260
We are a picture.

01:31:38.293 --> 01:31:40.929
Dude, the gold line.

01:31:40.963 --> 01:31:42.130
You look great.

01:31:43.999 --> 01:31:45.634
You guys, you guys.

01:31:45.668 --> 01:31:46.702
"While you were sleeping."

01:31:46.735 --> 01:31:48.136
Who plays
Sandra Bullock's husband?

01:31:48.170 --> 01:31:49.538
Who do you think?

01:31:50.973 --> 01:31:52.140
-Pullman!
-Paxton!

01:31:53.842 --> 01:31:54.877
Pullman.

01:31:54.910 --> 01:31:56.211
Dammit! Dammit!

01:31:58.113 --> 01:32:00.215
-You knew.
-I knew.

01:32:00.248 --> 01:32:01.617
Dearly beloved.

01:32:01.650 --> 01:32:03.251
We're gathered here today...

01:32:05.253 --> 01:32:07.590
for some reason.
Jay, why are we
gathered here today?

01:32:14.362 --> 01:32:15.898
The grass is always greener.

01:32:17.766 --> 01:32:18.934
Look at it.

01:32:18.967 --> 01:32:20.235
Acknowledge it.

01:32:20.268 --> 01:32:22.170
Play on it if you
want to play on it.

01:32:22.204 --> 01:32:24.106
Don't play on it if you
don't wanna play on it.

01:32:24.139 --> 01:32:27.542
But, uh... be honest.

01:32:31.780 --> 01:32:35.150
How you run your partnership
is ultimately up to you.

01:32:37.219 --> 01:32:40.555
But it's going to take you
some time to figure it out.

01:32:43.025 --> 01:32:45.193
And no matter what journey
you decide to take,

01:32:45.227 --> 01:32:47.596
just always remember
your way home.

01:32:47.630 --> 01:32:49.064
Or else, what's the point?

01:32:51.199 --> 01:32:55.237
If anyone here can find any
reason why these two should
not be married,

01:32:55.270 --> 01:32:57.673
"Milwaukee" now or forever
hold your peace.

01:32:58.941 --> 01:33:00.075
Do it!

01:33:04.012 --> 01:33:05.580
[all cheering]

01:33:12.120 --> 01:33:13.689
[Chris] Get over here.

01:33:16.124 --> 01:33:17.292
It'll all be great, man.

01:33:17.325 --> 01:33:18.360
Hey.

01:33:21.429 --> 01:33:22.631
Hey.

01:33:26.935 --> 01:33:28.637
I don't want to hate you.

01:33:28.671 --> 01:33:32.808
No, I couldn't think
of anything worse.

01:33:36.945 --> 01:33:39.214
So I guess...

01:33:39.247 --> 01:33:40.849
that's it?

01:33:40.883 --> 01:33:42.785
We don't have to
wait ten years.

01:33:42.818 --> 01:33:44.319
We don't have
kids to rip apart.

01:33:45.921 --> 01:33:47.790
Yeah, I know, you're right.

01:33:47.823 --> 01:33:51.827
You know, I want to be able
to see you and know that

01:33:51.860 --> 01:33:53.762
we haven't reached
the hate part yet.

01:33:55.097 --> 01:33:56.665
Yeah, I'd want that, too.

01:33:58.033 --> 01:33:59.034
Okay.

01:34:09.411 --> 01:34:14.282
* Crowds are buzzing
birds in need to crumble
at the feet of what I see *

01:34:19.287 --> 01:34:25.027
* Thinking faster than your car
We fall to see how high
we really are *

01:34:30.032 --> 01:34:32.334
* Call me innocent

01:34:34.870 --> 01:34:37.873
* 'Cause I'm still
without a name *

01:34:41.443 --> 01:34:46.048
* We're handing out miracles
and we're digging up the dead *

01:34:50.185 --> 01:34:54.757
* We're handing out miracles
and we're digging up the dead *

01:34:58.827 --> 01:35:01.964
* And we're jumping
over buildings now *

01:35:04.867 --> 01:35:07.736
* And we're jumping
over buildings now *

01:35:10.773 --> 01:35:13.408
* And we're jumping
over buildings now *

01:35:16.344 --> 01:35:22.751
* And we're jumping
over buildings now *

01:35:22.785 --> 01:35:27.489
* And don't you dare
look now there's a teenager
on the prowl *

01:35:27.522 --> 01:35:30.458
* And I'd scream if I knew how

01:35:34.062 --> 01:35:38.166
* And don't you dare
look now there's a teenager
on the prowl *

01:35:38.200 --> 01:35:42.004
* And I'd scream if I knew how

01:35:45.941 --> 01:35:48.076
* And call me innocent

01:35:50.946 --> 01:35:53.782
* 'Cause I'm still

01:35:56.184 --> 01:36:01.023
* We're handing out miracles
and we're digging up the dead *

01:36:03.859 --> 01:36:09.531
* We're handing out miracles
and we're digging up the dead *

01:36:13.101 --> 01:36:17.973
* With these razor sharp
instruments, raping every womb *

01:36:18.006 --> 01:36:22.310
* We knock out the sun
and we race to find a new one *

01:36:22.344 --> 01:36:26.982
* And we're handing out miracles
and we're digging up the dead *

01:36:31.386 --> 01:36:33.488
* And call me innocent

01:36:36.558 --> 01:36:39.394

01:36:58.380 --> 01:37:03.218
* We're handing out miracles
