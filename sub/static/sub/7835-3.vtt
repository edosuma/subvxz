01:25.627 --> 01:26.919
What are you reading, Homie?

01:27.004 --> 01:29.088
The Bridge column.

01:29.715 --> 01:33.342
Oh, that South. You never
know what he'll do next.

01:34.511 --> 01:36.679
Oh, look at that, "Dad and Drabble. "

01:36.764 --> 01:38.890
He's like an unfunny version of me.

01:38.974 --> 01:42.101
Where's Bart? His Mountain
Dew's getting flat.

01:42.186 --> 01:45.104
That's odd. He's outside digging.

01:45.189 --> 01:46.230
Probably digging for drugs.

01:46.315 --> 01:47.940
There's no drugs out there.

01:48.025 --> 01:49.692
No, of course not.

01:50.152 --> 01:53.112
It's not a school project.
I'd have heard of it.

01:53.197 --> 01:55.364
I'd better go check it out.

01:57.075 --> 01:58.117
What are you doing?

01:58.202 --> 01:59.786
Digging. Why?

01:59.870 --> 02:00.828
To make a hole.

02:00.913 --> 02:01.954
A hole for what?

02:02.039 --> 02:03.539
More digging.

02:04.875 --> 02:06.417
Okay, then.

02:13.175 --> 02:15.593
Don't worry, Marge. I'll
find out what he's up to.

02:15.677 --> 02:17.220
Kids shouldn't have secrets.

02:18.931 --> 02:22.683
Oh, hello, young man. Beautiful
day for digging, isn't it?

02:23.060 --> 02:24.477
Yep. Yeah.

02:24.728 --> 02:26.062
Uh...

02:26.730 --> 02:29.190
Digging for anything in particular?

02:29.274 --> 02:30.274
Nuh-uh.

02:30.359 --> 02:35.154
So, I guess you wouldn't mind
if I was to dig a hole of my own?

02:35.239 --> 02:36.656
Go for it. Maybe I will.

02:36.740 --> 02:39.075
What's stopping you? Very little.

02:42.996 --> 02:44.831
I'm having chest pains.

02:44.915 --> 02:47.083
Where's the defibrillator? Clear!

02:49.253 --> 02:51.087
This thing pays for itself.

02:53.590 --> 02:59.303
Bart? This is Dr. Kaufmann. He's
a special kind of "talking" doctor.

02:59.680 --> 03:00.930
Call me Bob.

03:01.014 --> 03:02.932
Well, that's quite a
hole you're digging.

03:03.016 --> 03:04.100
Thanks, Bob.

03:04.184 --> 03:08.020
You know, a hole is a great place
to hide when people are fighting.

03:08.105 --> 03:09.939
Are there angry people in your house?

03:10.023 --> 03:12.191
My dad's always yelling that
whitey's keeping him down.

03:12.276 --> 03:13.442
I see.

03:16.947 --> 03:19.991
You keep digging like this, you're
gonna go straight through to China.

03:20.075 --> 03:22.118
If it happens, it happens.

03:27.916 --> 03:31.544
Those inscrutable Americans.
What are they up to now?

03:31.628 --> 03:36.716
I will stop them. I am strong.
I am the Great Humungus!

03:36.800 --> 03:39.719
We all know you're the Great Humungus!

03:39.803 --> 03:41.053
Well, I'm just saying...

03:41.138 --> 03:42.847
Oh, you're always "just saying. "

03:42.931 --> 03:45.391
Homer, is this story going anywhere?

03:45.475 --> 03:48.477
Yes. Eventually, I become
king of the Morlocks.

03:48.562 --> 03:50.354
But Morlocks are from the future.

03:50.439 --> 03:51.814
You calling me a liar?

03:51.899 --> 03:52.899
Wait a minute, Homer.

03:52.983 --> 03:55.902
If it's true, what about all
the stuff you weren't around for?

03:55.986 --> 03:58.988
Yeah. How'd you know the
Chinese were spying on you?

03:59.072 --> 04:00.740
Well, I just naturally assumed.

04:00.824 --> 04:03.117
That is the stupidest
story I ever heard.

04:03.201 --> 04:06.412
And I've read the entire
Sweet Valley High series.

04:06.496 --> 04:09.498
I am sick of you drunks
and your shaggy dog stories.

04:09.583 --> 04:10.708
Sorry, Shaggy.

04:13.045 --> 04:15.504
Now I got to go home
to that! Thanks a lot!

04:15.589 --> 04:17.757
Oh, quit your bellyaching, Coffee Boy.

04:17.841 --> 04:19.341
You're lucky I let you in here.

04:19.426 --> 04:22.094
Geez, Moe. You've been
a real crank lately.

04:22.179 --> 04:23.179
You take that back!

04:23.263 --> 04:25.181
Now you see? That's
what I'm talking about.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.475
You're always pointing
that shotgun at us.

04:27.559 --> 04:29.352
And calling us "dumbasses. "

04:29.436 --> 04:30.895
Which we're so not.

04:30.979 --> 04:34.315
Well, can you blame me? Every
day it's the same old routine.

04:34.399 --> 04:35.942
I serve you drinks,

04:36.026 --> 04:39.570
You yak on and on and on, and
I never get one stinking tip.

04:39.655 --> 04:42.573
Maybe we'd tip you if
you'd smile once in awhile.

04:42.658 --> 04:44.825
What do you call this?

04:48.080 --> 04:50.039
Don't do that. Who am I kidding?

04:50.123 --> 04:54.001
I ain't smiled for real since I
nailed that rat with the ice pick.

04:54.086 --> 04:57.129
Remember that? That
was an amazing throw.

04:57.839 --> 04:59.799
How did I lose my passion for the job?

04:59.883 --> 05:01.300
When I was in bartending school,

05:01.385 --> 05:03.427
I thought I had the world by the jigger.

05:03.512 --> 05:05.471
Hey, where'd that painting come from?

05:05.555 --> 05:07.890
I put this up recently,
and it's a good thing I did

05:07.975 --> 05:10.601
because it really illustrates my point.

05:10.686 --> 05:12.937
Yeah, good old Swigmore U.

05:13.397 --> 05:17.441
Gee, when you talk about that
school, your voice fills with...

05:17.526 --> 05:19.026
What do you call it? Human feeling.

05:19.111 --> 05:21.696
Yeah. Maybe you should...
What's the expression?

05:21.780 --> 05:22.822
Go back there.

05:22.906 --> 05:24.949
What's the word I'm searching for? Uh...

05:25.033 --> 05:26.075
Yeah.

05:26.159 --> 05:30.496
A trip to the alma mater might really
rekindle my love of getting people loaded.

05:30.580 --> 05:32.164
But who'll run the
bar while you're gone?

05:32.249 --> 05:33.708
Ooh! Ooh! Pick me!

05:33.792 --> 05:35.001
Pick me, Lenny!

05:35.085 --> 05:36.836
Oh, pick me! I'm an urban Lenny!

05:36.920 --> 05:40.131
Look, I don't want to start
a tinkling contest here.

05:40.215 --> 05:41.340
Or do I?

05:42.092 --> 05:43.134
Woo-hoo!

05:43.218 --> 05:46.012
Oh, don't look so proud.
That was wind-assisted.

05:46.096 --> 05:48.681
And if anybody wants potato
chips or anything fancy,

05:48.765 --> 05:49.724
tell them to go to hell!

05:49.808 --> 05:52.852
Can do. Now don't you
worry about a thing.

05:55.439 --> 05:57.690
Hey, what are you doing?
I got to pay for that!

05:57.774 --> 06:00.109
No, Moe. You've got it all wrong.

06:00.402 --> 06:02.403
People buy beer from you.

06:04.614 --> 06:06.449
Look, I got to go.

06:11.538 --> 06:12.872
I thought you said you had to go?

06:20.881 --> 06:23.257
Ah, the old college gates.

06:28.430 --> 06:31.307
Ah, geez. The old college clock.

06:35.479 --> 06:38.522
Man, when's the last
time Moe cleaned this?

06:39.316 --> 06:41.317
Hey, Homer, another Duff.

06:44.279 --> 06:47.073
Hey, Homer, do you mind if
I bring in some outside food?

06:47.157 --> 06:50.618
Well, I don't know. What
would Moe say about that?

06:51.119 --> 06:54.914
But on the other hand, Moe's not here.

06:56.917 --> 06:59.126
Homer, you're the greatest.

06:59.836 --> 07:01.003
Hey! Lenny!

07:01.088 --> 07:02.254
Sorry. Sorry.

07:02.339 --> 07:05.883
For what? A little splattered
food never hurt anybody.

07:05.967 --> 07:08.677
Now everybody shut up and dance!

07:09.179 --> 07:10.846
Matty told Hatty

07:11.848 --> 07:14.225
About a thing she saw

07:15.644 --> 07:17.937
Had two big horns

07:19.689 --> 07:22.441
As time goes on

07:22.526 --> 07:23.943
I realize

07:24.027 --> 07:25.027
I realize...

07:25.112 --> 07:26.946
Hey, what happened to the music?

07:27.030 --> 07:30.783
Don't worry. You got to hit
it just right, like Fonzie.

07:30.992 --> 07:32.201
Eh!

07:32.619 --> 07:34.161
Oh! Whoa!

07:34.371 --> 07:35.996
Hemorrhage-amundo!

07:36.081 --> 07:37.123
Are you gonna be okay?

07:37.207 --> 07:38.791
Eh!

07:41.253 --> 07:45.464
Now can anyone tell me how much
grenadine is in a Cosmopolitan?

07:46.883 --> 07:48.050
None.

07:48.385 --> 07:51.428
A Cosmopolitan is made
with cranberry juice.

07:53.723 --> 07:56.392
Moe Szyslak, you old glasswipe.

07:59.771 --> 08:00.938
Yello?

08:01.022 --> 08:04.483
Yeah. I'd like to speak to a
Mr. Tabooger. First name Ollie.

08:04.568 --> 08:07.194
Ooh! Bart! My first
prank call. What do I do?

08:07.279 --> 08:10.072
Just ask if anyone knows Ollie Tabooger.

08:10.365 --> 08:11.323
I don't get it.

08:11.408 --> 08:13.325
Yell out, "I'll eat a booger. "

08:13.410 --> 08:14.410
What's the gag?

08:14.494 --> 08:15.578
Oh, forget it!

08:19.666 --> 08:23.794
Professor, I'm... I'm
burned out on bartending.

08:24.588 --> 08:26.172
When I first saw the movie Ironweed,

08:26.256 --> 08:28.924
I thought, you know, this is for me.

08:29.009 --> 08:31.760
But now, well, I'm not so sure.

08:32.095 --> 08:35.014
Nonsense. You were born to sling suds.

08:35.097 --> 08:37.308
The problem must lie elsewhere.

08:37.392 --> 08:39.602
Describe your tavern in one word.

08:39.936 --> 08:41.020
Uh...

08:41.104 --> 08:42.855
Is "crap-hole" one word?

08:42.938 --> 08:44.440
Yes, if it's hyphenated.

08:44.608 --> 08:46.108
Then I'll stick with crap-hole.

08:46.193 --> 08:50.029
Well, no wonder you're depressed
working in that environment.

08:50.113 --> 08:52.740
If you want my advice,
beautify your hole,

08:52.824 --> 08:54.658
and you'll beautify your soul.

08:54.951 --> 08:57.745
Nice hole, nice soul. Hmm.

08:59.497 --> 09:03.125
Look at that pond. Why
does the water sparkle so?

09:04.461 --> 09:06.086
I'm dying, Moe.

09:09.049 --> 09:10.424
Is there anything I can do?

09:10.508 --> 09:13.886
No. Unless you have a cure for cancer.

09:14.679 --> 09:18.724
Do you have a cure for cancer?
Because that would be great!

09:18.808 --> 09:20.059
I'm sorry, Professor.

09:20.310 --> 09:21.477
Goodbye, Moe.

09:21.811 --> 09:23.354
Bye, Professor.

09:26.399 --> 09:27.858
Hey, don't you want
to take your shoes off

09:27.943 --> 09:30.027
before you go swimming?

09:30.111 --> 09:31.487
Professor?

09:31.988 --> 09:33.197
Oh.

09:33.323 --> 09:34.406
Oh.

09:34.991 --> 09:36.242
Um...

09:37.160 --> 09:38.160
Hmm.

09:39.996 --> 09:42.665
I'm a-walking down the street

09:42.749 --> 09:44.541
Gonna open Moe's bar

09:44.626 --> 09:46.669
I'm a-singing what I'm thinking

09:46.753 --> 09:48.545
Hey, look at that dog...

09:50.674 --> 09:51.924
Huh?

09:52.008 --> 09:55.886
Teen vandals smashing the
bar! Moe's gonna kill me!

10:00.141 --> 10:01.141
Hey, Homer.

10:01.226 --> 10:02.559
You dirty teen!

10:05.689 --> 10:08.065
Hey, Homer, stop! Stop! It's me!

10:08.358 --> 10:12.152
Sheesh! Moe wrecking Moe's bar?

10:16.074 --> 10:19.660
I almost fainted, but then
I didn't. What are you doing?

10:19.744 --> 10:22.288
My professor said if I
prettied up this dump,

10:22.372 --> 10:23.789
it would renew my zeal.

10:23.873 --> 10:25.541
And it would look pretty, too.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.626
And now I want you to meet the guy

10:27.711 --> 10:30.754
who's gonna help bring
Moe's into the 20th century.

10:30.839 --> 10:33.299
I am Formico, the dean of design.

10:33.383 --> 10:35.050
Hi, Formico.
Uh-uh-uh.

10:35.135 --> 10:36.802
My name must never be spoken.

10:36.886 --> 10:39.096
Sorry. He seems nice.

10:43.768 --> 10:44.852
Not fair.

10:44.936 --> 10:47.646
Just when I was getting to be
the world's greatest bartender,

10:47.731 --> 10:49.648
it's all snatched away.

10:50.608 --> 10:51.900
Freshen your drink, pal?

10:51.985 --> 10:53.861
Just leave the bottle.

10:53.945 --> 10:55.362
There you go, doll.

10:55.447 --> 10:56.905
Ew!

10:58.033 --> 11:00.909
Look, buddy. I don't care where
you go, but you can't sleep here.

11:03.788 --> 11:05.622
Wow. Check out the new Moe's.

11:05.707 --> 11:09.168
Wow. It looks like
an alien headquarters.

11:09.544 --> 11:12.338
Couldn't you just see
aliens running out of there?

11:12.422 --> 11:13.547
Couldn't you?

11:13.631 --> 11:14.631
Hey, wait up!

11:14.716 --> 11:16.550
Looks like a long wait to get in.

11:18.928 --> 11:21.221
Not for friends of Moe's.

11:22.766 --> 11:25.684
Oi! Oi! Is your name on the list?

11:25.769 --> 11:27.478
Don't you know who I am?

11:27.562 --> 11:29.897
It's okay, Cecil. They're VIPs.

11:29.981 --> 11:31.982
Cecil is a girl's name.

11:34.527 --> 11:35.527
Oh!

11:41.409 --> 11:43.535
Welcome to m!

11:44.454 --> 11:46.997
So, what do you think of the new joint?

11:47.082 --> 11:49.708
This place looks like it's
from the not-too-distant future.

11:49.793 --> 11:51.752
Yeah. You like it, Homer?

11:51.836 --> 11:54.505
Um... The rabbits are cute.

11:54.589 --> 11:56.673
That one ain't moving.

11:57.300 --> 11:58.926
Change number seven.

11:59.010 --> 12:01.053
I don't get all this eyeball stuff.

12:01.137 --> 12:03.472
What are they supposed
to represent? Eyeballs?

12:03.556 --> 12:04.932
It's Po-Mo.

12:06.518 --> 12:07.976
Postmodern.

12:09.396 --> 12:11.021
Yeah, all right. Weird
for the sake of weird.

12:11.106 --> 12:12.439
Oh!

12:12.982 --> 12:14.233
Where are the barstools?

12:14.359 --> 12:15.651
Up there.

12:15.735 --> 12:17.444
Ain't it trippy?

12:17.529 --> 12:18.862
Whatever. Just give me a Duff.

12:18.947 --> 12:20.364
We don't serve Duff no more.

12:20.448 --> 12:22.574
We got a Malaysian beer
that's better than Duff.

12:22.659 --> 12:24.410
It's made out of soy sauce.

12:25.203 --> 12:27.079
Whatever. Just give me a Duff.

12:27.163 --> 12:30.374
Hey, Formico. Say hello
to my beloved regulars.

12:31.376 --> 12:32.835
Oh, hello.

12:36.214 --> 12:38.841
Moe, would you like to meet
some attractive young models?

12:38.925 --> 12:41.260
Models? Oh, boy.

12:46.015 --> 12:47.808
Okay, look cool.

12:50.019 --> 12:52.312
Wait a minute. You're all from Russia?

12:53.523 --> 12:55.399
And you really think
I'm attractive, huh?

12:58.111 --> 13:01.363
I don't know. What's so
great about this oxygen bar?

13:01.448 --> 13:03.657
Yeah, I think I'm getting the bends.

13:04.242 --> 13:05.784
Lenny, stand on my chest.

13:05.869 --> 13:09.288
I'm trapped. This is
creative design run amok.

13:09.372 --> 13:10.706
That's it!

13:11.166 --> 13:13.292
I'm gonna tell Moe exactly
what I think of his...

13:18.339 --> 13:21.967
After Chernobyl, my
penis is falling off.

13:22.260 --> 13:24.595
And "penis" is Russian for...

13:24.679 --> 13:26.263
Moe, we want our bar back!

13:26.347 --> 13:28.140
Yeah, this place is crazy!

13:28.224 --> 13:30.809
All these beautiful people
make us feel like losers!

13:30.894 --> 13:34.021
You'd be having a great time if
you'd stayed in your dark spot.

13:34.105 --> 13:35.814
Oh, so you're ashamed of us.

13:35.899 --> 13:38.233
Well, you've turned into a big phony!

13:38.318 --> 13:41.487
Hey! Nobody calls Moe St. Cool a phony!

13:41.571 --> 13:44.406
All this yelling is
taking away my horny.

13:44.866 --> 13:48.035
Is it? Oh, that's it...
That... Dagmar, Julian.

13:49.204 --> 13:50.621
Throw this bum out.

13:50.705 --> 13:53.165
I'll throw myself out, thank you.

13:56.794 --> 13:59.046
I believe I had a hat!

14:00.924 --> 14:02.674
Suckers!

14:09.098 --> 14:10.224
What are you doing, Dad?

14:10.308 --> 14:14.770
I think it's pretty obvious. I'm
turning our garage into a tavern!

14:15.104 --> 14:17.022
The kind Moe's used to be.

14:17.106 --> 14:20.192
This is pretty far to
go just to spite Moe.

14:20.276 --> 14:21.860
It's not about spite.

14:21.945 --> 14:25.364
It's about petty revenge and
getting back at that traitor, Moe!

14:25.448 --> 14:27.824
Now help me nail up this urinal.

14:32.121 --> 14:33.455
Beautiful.

14:33.915 --> 14:36.375
Running a bar is a full-time job,

14:36.459 --> 14:38.710
and you don't even
do your full-time job.

14:38.795 --> 14:43.048
But when I'm passionate about
something, I see it through to the end!

14:44.092 --> 14:46.635
Father, give me legs.

14:52.475 --> 14:53.809
Father!

15:06.322 --> 15:08.407
That is so interesting.

15:08.491 --> 15:10.909
So what you talking about?
Something interesting?

15:10.994 --> 15:14.830
No, I was just comparing
Kurosawa's films to Herzog's.

15:15.164 --> 15:16.290
Uh-huh.

15:17.083 --> 15:18.083
Carry on.

15:18.167 --> 15:21.169
My diet lets me eat anything
I want for one minute a day.

15:21.254 --> 15:23.797
My youth consultant
gives me Botox injections

15:23.881 --> 15:25.716
in my head, neck, and navel.

15:27.427 --> 15:30.470
Hiya, pal. So how about
them current events?

15:32.056 --> 15:34.433
Oh, you got one of
them cell phones, huh?

15:34.517 --> 15:36.852
Yeah. No cord at all on those.

15:38.688 --> 15:40.397
Hey, game's on!

15:40.523 --> 15:43.483
Hey, we were watching
that! Come on! Sports!

15:43.568 --> 15:46.445
Unless you're being
ironic, turn that off now.

15:50.491 --> 15:52.951
I'm glad you ain't around
to see what a mess I made.

15:53.036 --> 15:54.536
Oh, but I am.

15:57.540 --> 16:02.252
You've discarded your loyal
regulars for a mob of soulless snobs.

16:02.337 --> 16:04.296
Well, at least the tips are good.

16:04.380 --> 16:06.882
Are they, Moe? Take a look.

16:08.259 --> 16:09.259
Oh!

16:11.888 --> 16:14.139
Hey, why you mocking me? We're friends.

16:14.223 --> 16:15.223
Oh, right. Sorry.

16:15.308 --> 16:17.643
I won't drink at Moe's!

16:17.727 --> 16:20.187
Homer's old garage is all I need

16:20.271 --> 16:22.773
I won't drink at Moe's!

16:22.857 --> 16:25.484
Because Moe's a big
jerk and a she-male, too!

16:25.568 --> 16:27.110
That calls for another beer.

16:27.195 --> 16:28.195
Barkeep!

16:28.279 --> 16:30.739
I thought this was gonna be your bar.

16:30.823 --> 16:33.033
It's a family bar. Right, kids?

16:33.117 --> 16:34.910
Can we go to bed now?

16:34.994 --> 16:37.913
As soon as you finish
cutting up those lemons.

16:37.997 --> 16:40.082
But you're not even using them.

16:40.166 --> 16:44.586
She's so "sweepy. " She
doesn't know what she's saying.

16:45.630 --> 16:46.755
Aw!

16:49.258 --> 16:52.260
Who am I kidding? I ain't Moe St. Cool.

16:58.309 --> 17:00.686
How could I toss my
friends out into the cold

17:00.770 --> 17:03.230
with no place to get liquored up.

17:06.733 --> 17:08.609
Hey, what's going on?

17:12.531 --> 17:14.324
We're rocking great!

17:14.867 --> 17:17.035
Mount St. Edelite Leonard Bernstein

17:17.119 --> 17:19.413
Leonard what's-his-name
Herman Munster motorcade

17:19.497 --> 17:21.707
Birthday party, Cheetos
Pogo sticks and lemonade

17:21.790 --> 17:22.874
You symbiotic, stupid jerk

17:22.959 --> 17:26.252
That's right, Flanders
I'm talking about you

17:26.337 --> 17:28.505
How did you get R. E.M.
to play in your garage?

17:28.589 --> 17:33.760
I told them it was a benefit. They
think they're saving the rain forest!

17:35.638 --> 17:36.930
Suckers!

17:40.643 --> 17:41.977
Yeah, baby!

17:42.729 --> 17:44.730
Michael, are you sure
these guys are millionaires?

17:44.814 --> 17:47.607
Come on. Would a poor person
have a bar in his garage?

17:47.692 --> 17:49.484
Hey, guys. Stand around me.

17:49.569 --> 17:51.403
I can't go with Lenny watching.

17:51.487 --> 17:53.113
So, got to pee, huh?

17:53.197 --> 17:54.197
Forget it.

17:55.908 --> 17:58.493
What the... You can't open your own bar!

17:58.828 --> 18:00.412
Seems to me I already did.

18:00.496 --> 18:04.207
But it's illegal! You can't run
a bar in a private residence!

18:04.292 --> 18:07.794
Bar? I see no bar.
This is a hunting club.

18:09.088 --> 18:11.173
Which is permitted by state law

18:11.257 --> 18:14.259
to serve beverages of
a refreshing nature.

18:14.343 --> 18:15.343
Hunting club?

18:15.428 --> 18:17.012
You lied to us!

18:17.972 --> 18:18.972
Michael, no!

18:19.056 --> 18:20.515
That's not the R. E.M. way.

18:20.600 --> 18:21.600
You're right.

18:21.684 --> 18:24.352
Let's recycle those
shards and get out of here.

18:31.694 --> 18:33.445
Here we go. It also says,

18:33.529 --> 18:35.697
"A licensed hunting club must actively

18:35.782 --> 18:37.699
"engage in the sport of hunting. "

18:37.784 --> 18:40.786
Which I'll be doing
tomorrow morning, smart guy!

18:40.870 --> 18:43.038
Hunting? Dad, no!

18:43.623 --> 18:44.831
Lemons.

18:47.752 --> 18:49.628
It's not fair, Dad.

18:49.712 --> 18:52.839
Why should an animal die just
because you and Moe are fighting?

18:52.924 --> 18:54.716
It's the law. My hands are tied.

18:54.801 --> 18:58.386
Okay. Cranberry sauce,
stuffing, potatoes.

18:58.471 --> 19:01.306
Come on, turkey! Join your friends!

19:01.390 --> 19:02.557
Do you really think the turkey's

19:02.642 --> 19:04.559
just gonna climb onto the plate?

19:04.644 --> 19:05.977
I would.

19:07.230 --> 19:09.231
Psst. Lisa. Moe?

19:09.774 --> 19:12.317
Listen. I don't like you
and you don't like me,

19:12.401 --> 19:14.861
but we both want to stop
Homer from shooting a turkey.

19:14.946 --> 19:16.738
You don't like me? I like you.

19:16.823 --> 19:20.450
You do? Then I like you,
too. Here. Have a towelette.

19:21.369 --> 19:23.119
Here,
turkey-turkey-turkey!

19:23.204 --> 19:27.457
Turkey-turkey-turkey- turkey-turkey!
Nobody's gonna kill you.

19:27.750 --> 19:29.417
All right. From now on, no talking.

19:29.502 --> 19:32.587
If you want to signal
me, use this bird call.

19:34.006 --> 19:35.423
Ow! Ow!

19:35.800 --> 19:37.926
Not the face! Ooh! Ooh!

19:38.010 --> 19:39.761
Okay, the face!

19:40.638 --> 19:44.266
Oh, that actually feels
good after the crotch.

19:44.892 --> 19:47.978
All right, turkey, where are you?

19:48.563 --> 19:51.857
Turkeys, the only
animal smarter than man.

19:53.150 --> 19:55.277
What the hell is that?

19:55.611 --> 19:56.903
A turkey!

19:56.988 --> 19:59.531
Dad's gonna slaughter that poor turkey!

19:59.615 --> 20:01.867
Not if I scare it away
with this cougar call.

20:06.289 --> 20:07.873
You did it, Moe!

20:09.834 --> 20:11.626
A cougar! Die, cougar!

20:13.129 --> 20:15.964
My leg! Oh, geez!

20:16.424 --> 20:18.133
Got that cat right in the leg.

20:18.217 --> 20:20.093
Dad, you shot Moe!

20:20.177 --> 20:23.346
Oh, no! This time I
really am gonna faint!

20:26.475 --> 20:27.475
Son of a...

20:27.560 --> 20:30.228
How'd they get your bar back
to normal so quickly, Moe?

20:30.313 --> 20:32.856
It's a snap when you use
certified contractors.

20:32.940 --> 20:34.983
Like the ones found in
your local yellow pages?

20:35.067 --> 20:36.318
Exactly.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.739
I'm sorry I shot you, Moe.

20:40.823 --> 20:43.408
Aw, that's okay. It's
like my dad always said,

20:43.492 --> 20:45.869
"Eventually everybody gets shot. "

20:46.120 --> 20:48.914
Oh, I'm glad you two are friends again

20:48.998 --> 20:52.709
so we can all have Thanksgiving
dinner together in this bar.

20:53.210 --> 20:55.086
Hey, who invited the hippies?

20:55.171 --> 20:58.882
I did. You owe R. E.M.
an apology for eco-fraud.

20:58.966 --> 21:03.511
All right, I'm sorry. But I
will not save the rain forest!

21:03.971 --> 21:05.889
Good enough. Let's eat.

21:06.515 --> 21:09.434
And we should all be thankful
to Michael, Peter, and Mike

21:09.518 --> 21:13.355
for supplying this beautiful
turkey made entirely of tofu.

21:13.689 --> 21:15.357
Tofu and gluten.

21:16.233 --> 21:18.068
I'm thankful I ate before I came.

21:18.152 --> 21:20.862
Oh, come on, Bart. Smell those curds.

21:21.364 --> 21:22.572
Mmm!

21:23.157 --> 21:24.324
Curds.

21:24.825 --> 21:28.620
And I'm thankful I get to spend
Thanksgiving with my family,

21:28.704 --> 21:32.457
these alternative rockers,
and my favorite bartender.

21:33.125 --> 21:34.292
Here you go, pal.

21:34.377 --> 21:36.002
And here you go!
