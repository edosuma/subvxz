we have to tell him, hannah. you have to.

or we can go out for pancakes.

01:24.900 --> 01:26.100
how about a neck rub?

01:26.400 --> 01:27.700
your back must be killing you.

01:27.800 --> 01:29.300
that sofa is ancient.

01:32.600 --> 01:34.000
you're not even gonna talk to me?

01:34.300 --> 01:35.500
what do you want me to say?

01:36.400 --> 01:37.500
anything.

01:37.600 --> 01:40.500
tell me what to do, how to make things better.

01:40.700 --> 01:41.600
go back in time.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.500
take your hands off my best friend.

01:44.400 --> 01:45.500
that's a start.

01:49.300 --> 01:52.100
hey, nick. what's in the box?

01:52.800 --> 01:56.400
only the meager cots  of my former office at the ???

01:57.500 --> 01:58.900
so you quit?

01:59.900 --> 02:00.900
yeah, i did...

02:01.000 --> 02:03.500
in a "fired" kind of way.

02:04.400 --> 02:06.400
here, drop that in. i'll help you out.

02:06.500 --> 02:07.500
thanks.

02:08.400 --> 02:09.300
so i guess that means you'll have time

02:09.400 --> 02:10.800
to open your window business.

02:11.700 --> 02:12.800
 yeah, i guess.

02:13.700 --> 02:14.400
truth is, it's something

02:14.500 --> 02:16.800
that eddie and ilways planned on doing since we were kids.

02:17.600 --> 02:19.300
"best friend windows" is what we called it.

02:19.700 --> 02:21.500
kind of a dorky name, isn't it?

02:21.700 --> 02:22.500
we were 10.

02:22.600 --> 02:23.500
i'm 10.

02:23.600 --> 02:24.600
yeah, but you're a--

02:24.700 --> 02:25.700
different kind of dork?

02:26.500 --> 02:27.700
different kind of 10.

02:28.600 --> 02:30.200
just let me see.

02:30.400 --> 02:32.300
i can't believe you're making me do this.

02:32.400 --> 02:34.800
right. i <i>really</i> twisted your arm.

02:35.200 --> 02:38.200
my mother wore this dress in 1977.

02:39.400 --> 02:40.600
this...

02:41.400 --> 02:42.800
is never gonna work.

02:47.200 --> 02:48.400
yeah, are you happy now?

02:48.900 --> 02:51.700
okay. so it's not gonna work.

02:53.400 --> 02:54.400
you hear about my mom?

02:54.600 --> 02:56.400
not so much heard as saw.

02:56.800 --> 02:58.100
are you okay with it?

02:59.100 --> 03:00.800
okay with it? why wouldn't i be okay with it?

03:01.400 --> 03:02.400
i don't know.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
i'm okay with it.

03:04.800 --> 03:05.600
cool.

03:06.700 --> 03:07.700
are <i>you?</i>

03:07.900 --> 03:10.000
me? why wouldn't i be okay with it?

03:10.500 --> 03:11.400
i don't know.

03:11.500 --> 03:12.700
i'm okay with it.

03:13.400 --> 03:14.400
cool.

03:14.500 --> 03:15.500
cool.

03:21.800 --> 03:22.900
you gotta help me.

03:23.300 --> 03:26.400
rowan family reconciliation not going as planned?

03:27.500 --> 03:28.500
i'm trying.

03:28.700 --> 03:31.400
i wanna forgive her. i wanna keep my family together.

03:31.500 --> 03:32.100
but? 

03:32.200 --> 03:33.900
but i can't get the picture

03:34.100 --> 03:36.200
of alison with ikey

03:36.400 --> 03:37.500
out of my mind.

03:37.600 --> 03:39.200
it--it's seared on my brain,

03:39.400 --> 03:42.600
and it just hangs there right in front of my face 24/7.

03:42.700 --> 03:45.000
it's like, the other day, i took the kids to the park,

03:45.100 --> 03:47.200
and i'm looking at the sky, and i swear,

03:47.300 --> 03:50.700
two of the clouds looked like alison and ikey having sex.

03:50.800 --> 03:52.900
it's not uncommon for cumulonimbus clouds

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
to have anthropomorphic qualities.

03:54.100 --> 03:56.900
it's not just one picture, phil. it's a thousand--

03:57.500 --> 04:00.000
all--all the ways they did it, all the places they did it,

04:00.100 --> 04:01.600
all the lies they told me

04:01.700 --> 04:03.900
as they boffed like banshees behind my back.

04:04.400 --> 04:05.800
do--do banshees boff?

04:05.900 --> 04:06.800
they do.

04:07.400 --> 04:08.500
ugh!

04:08.600 --> 04:09.600
i can't handle this!

04:11.600 --> 04:13.000
maybe this is it for us.

04:16.100 --> 04:18.800
maybe there's no way back

04:18.899 --> 04:20.899
to--to--to who we were

04:21.200 --> 04:22.900
or--or what i thought we had.

04:28.900 --> 04:29.900
there is.

04:30.500 --> 04:31.500
i read about this.

04:31.600 --> 04:33.600
it'll take hard work,  but you can do it.

04:34.300 --> 04:36.800
listen, living inside your head

04:37.300 --> 04:40.100
with all those thoughts-- they'll crush you,

04:40.800 --> 04:43.100
make it so e-even with-- the those you love,

04:43.200 --> 04:44.100
you're all alone.

04:44.500 --> 04:46.600
what <i>could</i> have happened. what <i>might</i> have happened.

04:46.700 --> 04:48.100
what you pray didn't happen.

04:48.200 --> 04:50.700
more to the point-- did you make the right decision?

04:53.300 --> 04:55.400
the only way to get out

04:56.100 --> 04:58.400
is to face what really did happen...

04:58.500 --> 04:59.600
...maybe a little bit like a birthday cake?

05:01.500 --> 05:02.400
i can't get it up.

05:02.500 --> 05:03.600
just try.

05:04.400 --> 05:06.000
well, suck it in.

05:10.900 --> 05:11.800
embrace it.

05:12.800 --> 05:12.700
hi, guys. 

05:13.800 --> 05:14.600
own it...

05:14.700 --> 05:15.700
sorry. i was just...

05:16.600 --> 05:18.500
and the remedy will appear.

05:19.100 --> 05:20.200
helping sam with his pastry.

05:20.300 --> 05:23.100
uh, no, it's fine. i mean, i was just...

05:55.200 --> 05:56.900
i thought i was okay with it.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.200
i thought i was fine.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.600
i mean, who am i to come back after all these years

06:01.700 --> 06:03.200
and just win her back?

06:04.000 --> 06:06.100
but then seeing her like <i>that?</i>

06:07.100 --> 06:08.800
i don't know. it just made it all seem so...

06:09.200 --> 06:10.200
real?

06:15.400 --> 06:16.200
hey.

06:17.200 --> 06:18.100
hey.

06:19.800 --> 06:20.800
what's with him?

06:21.400 --> 06:24.300
he's currently in a "i just saw hannah in a wedding dress,

06:24.400 --> 06:27.700
and, oh, my god, she really is marrying big cat cataldo" funk.

06:27.800 --> 06:29.600
no. i'm fine.

06:31.400 --> 06:33.500
so what do you say? are we gonna do this?

06:33.700 --> 06:35.900
open "best friend windows" for real this time?

06:36.300 --> 06:37.300
you mean, uh...

06:38.500 --> 06:39.700
"best friend plywood"?

06:40.600 --> 06:43.800
it's not exactly great advertising a window shop without a window.

06:44.200 --> 06:45.100
you know what? he's right.

06:45.200 --> 06:47.600
it's like opening a vegetarian restaurant and having the letters

06:47.700 --> 06:49.400
of your sign made of little salamis.

06:49.500 --> 06:50.900
we had this idea together.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.800
it was, like, a hundred years ago, nick.

06:53.500 --> 06:55.200
and besides, i already got a business.

06:55.300 --> 06:56.300
well, what's left of it.

06:56.400 --> 06:58.500
i mean, word is,  is that cataldo left you with 

06:58.600 --> 07:00.600
two residentials and the video store.

07:00.800 --> 07:02.400
video store doesn't even have a lawn.

07:03.500 --> 07:04.800
come on, man.

07:04.900 --> 07:07.500
there's no "best friend windows" without your best friend.

07:09.700 --> 07:11.400
you didn't really just say that.

07:11.500 --> 07:13.600
he's in an emotionally fragile state right now--

07:13.700 --> 07:17.000
hannah, the wedding dress... inability to let go.

07:17.300 --> 07:19.600
well, he has to let go, because <i>she</i> is definitely

07:19.700 --> 07:20.400
marrying another dude.

07:20.500 --> 07:22.300
guys, i'm right here.

07:22.900 --> 07:24.200
we gonna do this or not?

07:29.900 --> 07:31.200
let me get back to you on that.

07:31.300 --> 07:32.100
okay.

07:39.800 --> 07:41.300
listen, sam, about this morning--

07:42.400 --> 07:43.500
you wanna talk about it?

07:44.100 --> 07:45.000
not really.

07:46.200 --> 07:48.500
so... we're okay?

07:48.800 --> 07:49.600
yeah.

07:49.800 --> 07:50.600
i mean, 

07:50.700 --> 07:53.100
obviously,  i knewyou guys were gonna get married.

07:54.300 --> 07:55.400
i don't know.

07:56.200 --> 07:57.800
what, you don't want us to get married, ace-man?

07:58.200 --> 07:59.200
no, i do.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.100
it's just...  i have a couple of questions.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.900
okay. ask away.

08:06.400 --> 08:09.300
well, for starters, where are we gonna live?

08:09.400 --> 08:11.500
that's easy. we're gonna move in the spec house built.

08:11.600 --> 08:14.400
whoa, wait a minute. we're not moving.

08:15.500 --> 08:16.200
yeah, but i thought that--

08:16.300 --> 08:17.600
spec house was an amazing gesture,

08:17.800 --> 08:19.800
but, i mean, this is our home.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.800
so is ray moving in here?

08:22.900 --> 08:23.700
-no. -yes.

08:23.800 --> 08:25.500
and what about jasper and casper?

08:25.800 --> 08:26.900
are they moving in, too?

08:27.000 --> 08:28.600
do i have to share my room with them?

08:28.700 --> 08:30.800
and is there any chance that i can move in with doodie

08:30.900 --> 08:31.900
the days that they're here?

08:32.100 --> 08:34.500
look, sam, we're gonna  figure everything out, 

08:35.100 --> 08:36.100
right, ray?

08:36.700 --> 08:37.799
yeah, of course.

08:40.299 --> 08:42.200
well, be sure to let me know when you guys decide.

08:53.800 --> 08:54.800
-hey, guys. -hey.

08:54.900 --> 08:55.700
hey.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.600
physical phil's got a great idea.

08:58.300 --> 09:00.000
is this one better than the "soup-straw"?

09:00.400 --> 09:02.000
soup-straw was a viable concept.

09:02.600 --> 09:05.000
the aperture gets bigger to accommodate the chunky parts.

09:05.100 --> 09:06.600
no splatter. no splash.

09:07.400 --> 09:10.300
if only i'd figured out a way to cool the broth on the way up,

09:10.400 --> 09:11.600
it would've been a roaring success.

09:11.700 --> 09:12.600
no, this is an idea

09:12.700 --> 09:14.300
about how to save my marriage,

09:14.400 --> 09:15.900
my sanity, my life.

09:16.000 --> 09:16.600
okay.

09:16.700 --> 09:18.300
but... we'll need your help.

09:19.000 --> 09:19.800
what's the idea?

09:19.900 --> 09:20.900
infidelity tour.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.300
what's an infidelity tour?

09:23.100 --> 09:25.000
it's this thing that physical phil heard about.

09:25.100 --> 09:27.900
see, apparently, owen can't forgive alison and get past

09:28.000 --> 09:29.800
what happened because he doesn't <i>know</i> 

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
exactly...what happened.

09:32.100 --> 09:33.200
thank god for that.

09:33.800 --> 09:35.300
the details-- what good would they do?

09:35.900 --> 09:37.400
it's better than all the possibilities

09:37.500 --> 09:39.100
he'sot swimming around in his head.

09:39.200 --> 09:40.400
what kinds of possibilities?

09:41.900 --> 09:43.400
well, right now his mind is trying

09:43.500 --> 09:45.600
to make sense of it all. you know, fill in the gaps.

09:46.600 --> 09:47.700
but that only makes things worse.

09:48.300 --> 09:49.700
his imagination is his enemy.

09:49.800 --> 09:50.800
so i'm supposed to sit down

09:50.900 --> 09:53.400
and just lay out all the gory details of the affair?

09:53.700 --> 09:55.800
not exactly. uh... 

09:56.700 --> 09:58.600
owen has to go to the actual scenes of the crime.

09:58.700 --> 10:00.900
owen's gonna put that kind of face time in with me?

10:01.800 --> 10:04.100
well, that's where i come in.

10:04.200 --> 10:05.000
neutral third party.

10:05.100 --> 10:05.900
that's what you call yourself?

10:06.000 --> 10:07.200
i'm supposed interview you both,

10:07.300 --> 10:08.400
get all the info,

10:08.500 --> 10:09.700
collate the different accounts,

10:09.800 --> 10:11.000
and then take owen around myself.

10:11.100 --> 10:11.900
i get it--

10:12.000 --> 10:13.800
????

10:13.900 --> 10:15.500
he's got to face it all, head on--

10:15.600 --> 10:17.700
when it happened, where it happened,

10:18.000 --> 10:19.600
-how many times it happened. -absolutely not. 

10:19.700 --> 10:21.200
doing those things was bad enough.

10:21.300 --> 10:23.800
telling owen about them would be somehow even more wicked.

10:23.900 --> 10:25.700
well, he has to see the truth for what it is

10:25.800 --> 10:27.100
it's the only way he can move forward.

10:27.200 --> 10:29.300
whatever it takes. whatever owen wants.

10:29.500 --> 10:32.200
all the guys--eddie, phil-- ???.

10:32.600 --> 10:33.900
well, you know, who knows?

10:34.300 --> 10:36.600
maybe it's not just owen and alison who can reconcile.

10:36.700 --> 10:40.100
maybe you and o-ro can find a way back to each other, too.

10:40.200 --> 10:41.100
i won't do it.

10:41.300 --> 10:42.700
do you want to save your marriage or not?

10:42.800 --> 10:45.600
wow. what a great idea.

10:46.600 --> 10:47.600
right, nicky?

10:47.700 --> 10:49.200
no way. i'm not gonna be a part of that.

10:49.500 --> 10:51.100
you kina of owe me, buddy.

10:51.500 --> 10:53.200
you kinda do, nick.

10:53.600 --> 10:55.000
you kept the secret of the affair.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.100
now it's time to expose it to the light.

11:01.600 --> 11:03.500
you got a pen and a notebook around here?

11:03.800 --> 11:04.700
yeah!

11:37.100 --> 11:38.000
that's it.

11:38.800 --> 11:39.700
all right, man.

11:49.900 --> 11:50.700
come in.

11:52.900 --> 11:53.700
hey.

11:53.900 --> 11:54.700
hey.

11:56.200 --> 11:57.000
what are you doin'?

11:57.300 --> 11:59.300
well, i was just in the neighborhood.

12:01.100 --> 12:02.900
last fall clean up for the spitzers.

12:03.400 --> 12:05.500
so you and big cat engaged.

12:05.600 --> 12:07.400
yeah. it's crazy, right?

12:07.700 --> 12:10.100
yeah. soup-straw crazy.

12:11.400 --> 12:12.800
i don't know what that means.

12:14.100 --> 12:16.400
you didn't tell him, did you--nick?

12:17.200 --> 12:19.000
and i'm not talking about the engagement.

12:19.100 --> 12:20.500
no. not yet.

12:22.100 --> 12:23.900
nick's not leaving anytime soon,

12:24.100 --> 12:25.800
and he wants us to open up the window shop.

12:27.200 --> 12:28.300
i can't do that, hannah,

12:29.500 --> 12:30.800
when i'm holding this secret.

12:31.100 --> 12:31.900
eddie--

12:32.000 --> 12:33.600
nick deserves to know, hannah,

12:33.700 --> 12:35.400
-that you and-- -no.

12:37.800 --> 12:38.700
don't do this, eddie.

12:38.800 --> 12:41.000
just... don't.

12:44.700 --> 12:45.700
fine.

12:47.200 --> 12:48.700
but if you're not gonna tell nick,

12:49.900 --> 12:51.200
then i will.

12:52.700 --> 12:54.300
do you really want to do that to sam?

12:54.500 --> 12:55.000
listen--

12:55.100 --> 12:56.400
he's got enough on his plate.

12:56.800 --> 12:59.500
i'm marrying ray. sam's entire world is changing,

12:59.600 --> 13:01.700
and he doesn't seem to be handling it too well.

13:02.400 --> 13:03.500
and so help me god, eddie, 

13:03.600 --> 13:05.600
if you make things  worse for him right now,

13:05.700 --> 13:06.700
i will kill you.

13:07.700 --> 13:09.400
-hannah-- -not just ruin your life,

13:10.000 --> 13:11.300
not just distribute those pictures of you

13:11.400 --> 13:14.000
from the ninth grade where  you had to wear those fishnet stockings,

13:14.300 --> 13:17.400
but seriously, seriously kill you,

13:17.600 --> 13:19.300
like dead and gone

13:19.400 --> 13:20.500
for eternity.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.900
guess i'll just have to watch my back.

13:43.000 --> 13:43.500
 okay.

13:44.900 --> 13:46.200
this is where it all began, 

13:46.500 --> 13:47.400
3:00 a.m.,

13:47.500 --> 13:49.200
the night of ducky lowe's super bowl party.

13:49.300 --> 13:50.300
i remember that party.

13:50.900 --> 13:51.800
really?

13:52.200 --> 13:54.000
that's surprising, since, according to my notes,

13:54.100 --> 13:56.200
you got bombed and passed out on ducky's couch.

13:56.300 --> 13:58.500
as i recall, there was a quarters game,

13:58.800 --> 14:00.900
and bubba willis was on a roll.

14:01.300 --> 14:02.400
it happens.

14:02.500 --> 14:04.400
well, so do angry wives,

14:04.800 --> 14:07.200
especially when they're left alone in need of a ride home.

14:07.300 --> 14:08.300
so--so what,

14:08.400 --> 14:11.500
alison can't drive my car, can't get herself home?

14:12.000 --> 14:13.500
she wasn't exactly sober, either.

14:13.600 --> 14:16.500
oh, and ikey ifor sure the clear go-to guy

14:16.600 --> 14:18.000
for designated driver.

14:21.000 --> 14:21.900
go.

14:22.300 --> 14:23.400
okay.

14:23.500 --> 14:26.200
ikey drives alison home. she starts to cry.

14:26.300 --> 14:27.700
she--wait, she was crying?

14:28.000 --> 14:28.500
yeah. 

14:28.600 --> 14:29.800
because i passed out?

14:29.900 --> 14:32.300
yes. so alison's crying.

14:32.400 --> 14:35.500
-ikey pulls over here to comfort her-- -w-w-wait, he <i>pulls over?</i>

14:36.000 --> 14:37.600
he can't comfort her with one hand?

14:37.700 --> 14:39.900
one hand on the wheel, one hand comforting?

14:40.000 --> 14:41.700
how about no hands comforting?

14:41.800 --> 14:44.200
why do hands have to be involved at all

14:44.300 --> 14:45.400
in the comforting process?

14:45.500 --> 14:46.600
i mean, look at this place.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.500
all these houses. anyone could have seen 'em.

14:48.700 --> 14:49.700
why didn't anyone see 'em?

14:49.900 --> 14:52.000
'cause it's 3:00 a.m. in knights ridge.

14:52.200 --> 14:53.400
and a good thing, too.

14:53.500 --> 14:56.000
there could've been kids out front playing on the swings.

14:56.100 --> 14:58.700
what would they have thought if--if they see a truck

14:58.800 --> 15:00.000
going up and down?

15:00.300 --> 15:02.600
i mean, what would they think if they--if they saw that?

15:14.100 --> 15:15.100
are you okay?

15:16.000 --> 15:17.900
i was trying to make it all the way to the porch.

15:18.700 --> 15:20.400
wow. cool.

15:21.300 --> 15:22.300
i'm hannah.

15:22.400 --> 15:23.600
yeah, i know.

15:24.500 --> 15:25.600
i'm nick.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.700
i'm gonna live on the moon one day.

15:30.200 --> 15:31.300
why the moon?

15:31.500 --> 15:34.300
'cause on the moon all the beaches have jukeboxes.

15:34.500 --> 15:35.500
really?

15:35.600 --> 15:38.200
really. you... wanna come with me?

15:39.500 --> 15:40.400
okay.

15:40.800 --> 15:43.200
great. you can bring the spaghetti.

15:53.400 --> 15:54.100
nick.

15:54.300 --> 15:55.600
are you listening to me, nicky?

15:57.100 --> 15:59.100
yeah, i'm sorry. it's just...

15:59.600 --> 16:01.300
i haven't been back to the ridge in so long.

16:02.400 --> 16:04.300
but--no, we're here for you. i'm sorry.

16:05.100 --> 16:06.200
how you feeling so far?

16:06.500 --> 16:07.400
i feel terrible.

16:07.900 --> 16:09.000
well, maybe we should stop.

16:09.100 --> 16:12.100
no, this is what the infidelity tour is all about.

16:13.200 --> 16:16.400
i always thought when they first got together,

16:16.800 --> 16:19.000
it was, like keerotic

16:19.700 --> 16:21.100
not truck sex.

16:21.900 --> 16:23.200
no, it was truck sex.

16:23.500 --> 16:24.700
alison said, and i quote,

16:24.800 --> 16:25.800
"when i got home that night,

16:26.100 --> 16:28.500
there was a cheeseburger wrapper sticking to my back."

16:29.800 --> 16:31.000
hardly erotic.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.200
i'm breathing.

16:36.200 --> 16:37.100
i'm breathing better.

16:37.200 --> 16:38.900
you're--you're doing a good job, nicky.

16:39.000 --> 16:39.800
okay.

16:40.900 --> 16:41.900
what's next?

16:42.700 --> 16:43.700
ikey's house.

16:44.200 --> 16:45.800
i'm so happy to see you both.

16:45.900 --> 16:47.500
it's been too long.

16:47.900 --> 16:49.400
i never read your book, nick.

16:49.600 --> 16:51.600
no offense, i like the thrillers.

16:51.800 --> 16:54.800
give me a man with a knife in an abandoned shipyard--

16:55.000 --> 16:56.100
more my cup of tea.

16:56.700 --> 16:58.200
yeah, me, too, actually.

16:58.500 --> 17:00.000
oh. here we go.

17:00.300 --> 17:02.600
david will be thrilled to see you when he gets home.

17:03.200 --> 17:05.800
remember all the parties you kids used to have up here?

17:06.300 --> 17:07.800
fun times.

17:08.500 --> 17:09.500
you were a cool mom.

17:09.900 --> 17:11.599
david has been very depressed lately.

17:11.800 --> 17:14.700
oh, you hear that, nicky? david's been depressed.

17:14.900 --> 17:16.800
well, make yourselves at home.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.500
david will be along. bye-bye.

17:18.599 --> 17:19.400
bye.

17:25.099 --> 17:26.599
so this was their place

17:27.200 --> 17:28.400
where they always did it?

17:28.600 --> 17:29.600
this was it.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.700
tell me, how do you get from onetime,

17:31.800 --> 17:33.200
side-of-the-road truck sex

17:33.300 --> 17:35.000
to a full-on affair?

17:36.000 --> 17:37.900
well, the day after ducky lowe's party,

17:38.100 --> 17:39.400
alison came here to tell ikey

17:39.500 --> 17:42.100
what happened was an isolated incident,

17:42.500 --> 17:43.900
that it was a big mistake,

17:44.000 --> 17:45.900
that it would never happen again and...

17:46.900 --> 17:48.500
yeah? and then what?

17:50.000 --> 17:51.300
and then they got naked.

17:54.700 --> 17:55.800
okay.

17:57.200 --> 17:58.600
rip the band-aid, nicky.

17:58.800 --> 17:59.300
what are you talking about?

17:59.400 --> 18:00.700
give me all the sex stuff now.

18:01.100 --> 18:03.200
hands, tongues, legs, whatever--

18:03.300 --> 18:04.400
get it all out of the way,

18:04.600 --> 18:05.400
all at once.

18:05.500 --> 18:07.100
you know, really don't think that's such a good idea.

18:07.200 --> 18:09.500
i'm a big boy. i can take it.

18:09.900 --> 18:10.900
are you sure?

18:13.200 --> 18:15.100
okay. ikey is very...

18:15.500 --> 18:16.500
very creative.

18:16.600 --> 18:17.600
he's got...

18:18.000 --> 18:20.600
this thing he does--

18:21.700 --> 18:22.700
a move.

18:23.800 --> 18:24.900
he calls it...

18:27.100 --> 18:28.800
he calls it "the pablo picasso."

18:28.900 --> 18:30.100
"pablo picasso"?

18:30.400 --> 18:32.600
what the hell's a "pablo picasso"?

18:32.800 --> 18:35.300
what--what does ikey know from pablo picasso?

18:36.000 --> 18:38.500
"the--the pablo picasso," when done correctly,

18:41.900 --> 18:42.800
-are you sure? -go.

18:42.900 --> 18:44.400
it turns two bodies 

18:44.500 --> 18:46.600
into many random angles,

18:47.100 --> 18:49.600
interconnecting at various different...

18:50.200 --> 18:51.000
junctures,

18:51.100 --> 18:52.500
so to speak.

18:54.200 --> 18:55.100
i'm sorry.

18:57.800 --> 18:59.200
i didn't wanna tell you.

19:00.500 --> 19:01.700
give me that.

19:16.200 --> 19:17.600
carrot, can you give us a second?

19:21.800 --> 19:24.000
why does owen keep playing that duran duran song

19:24.100 --> 19:25.200
over and over again?

19:25.300 --> 19:27.000
he likes it. it has meaning to him.

19:27.100 --> 19:29.900
besides, it is the perfect high school graduation song.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.400
i know, but it's just weird--

19:32.100 --> 19:35.000
a big guy like that liking a song so soft and sad.

19:35.100 --> 19:36.200
oh, come on. he's sensitive.

19:36.900 --> 19:38.000
speaking of sensitive...

19:38.900 --> 19:41.100
the scaffolding is coming for the duomo this summer,

19:41.600 --> 19:44.000
and we have to get there.

19:44.100 --> 19:45.200
we may not have time.

19:47.500 --> 19:48.800
we're going to europe for six weeks

19:48.900 --> 19:50.300
and we're not gonna have time to get to florence?

19:50.500 --> 19:52.000
who knows?  not if we plan on going

19:52.000 --> 19:56.400
to paris, venice, rome, barcelona, prague... no.

19:57.600 --> 20:01.100
i mean, is that why    you asked me to come up here?

20:01.600 --> 20:02.500
no.

20:03.400 --> 20:05.100
i was just looking at you across the room,

20:05.100 --> 20:08.100
and i thought that if i don't get to spill myself

20:08.100 --> 20:10.200
all over you soon, i was gonna scream.

20:13.400 --> 20:16.400
<i>* what is happening to me? *</i>

20:16.700 --> 20:19.200
<i>* crazy,some would say *</i>

20:20.100 --> 20:21.100
   what?

20:21.400 --> 20:22.900
oh, it just hit me.

20:23.100 --> 20:24.100
hmm?

20:24.900 --> 20:27.600
we're going to europe    for six weeks.

20:27.800 --> 20:29.100
yes, we are.

20:32.900 --> 20:35.100
nick, why is <i>he</i> here?

20:39.600 --> 20:40.900
what the hell are you doing?

20:40.900 --> 20:43.100
sorry, i-i-i-i figured,   uh...

20:43.200 --> 20:44.800
   hey, i thought    you'd be done by now.

20:44.800 --> 20:47.100
i-i thought i was following   the tour schedule.

20:48.200 --> 20:51.300
owen, let's go. we're done    for the day. ikey--

20:51.300 --> 20:52.400
hey-- t--get out of the way.

20:52.400 --> 20:55.000
i just wanna say right on  g this, man.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.700
whatever it takes to make things right.

20:57.200 --> 20:58.600
  i mi-- i miss you, buddy.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
   sex offender. what?

21:01.000 --> 21:03.900
  sex offender. whoa. how do you figure sex offender?

21:03.900 --> 21:06.900
he has offended me  by having sex with my wife!

21:06.900 --> 21:08.800
all right, come on.   owen. owen.

21:08.800 --> 21:11.900
why?! why?!  why did you do that? owen!

21:14.000 --> 21:15.600
 hey! come on! ... no!

21:15.600 --> 21:16.500
 that's enough.  that's enough.

21:16.500 --> 21:19.200
you were the one, ikey--   when i broke my arm,

21:19.400 --> 21:22.300
  when i crashed my dad's truck, when buster died--

21:22.500 --> 21:25.900
  you were the one i called,   but no more, ikey.

21:26.000 --> 21:26.900
no more.

21:26.900 --> 21:30.000
   me and alison--  we might get back together.

21:30.200 --> 21:31.500
but me and you--

21:31.500 --> 21:33.900
 we will never    be friends again.

21:36.400 --> 21:37.400
never.

21:37.400 --> 21:38.600
come on.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.400
go. go.

21:49.900 --> 21:51.600
ever we live, these bagels

21:51.600 --> 21:53.000
are on the permanent menu

21:53.300 --> 21:54.700
 every sunday morning.

21:54.800 --> 21:57.300
where are they from again? oh, i got a guy.

21:57.700 --> 21:58.600
you got a bagel guy?

21:58.600 --> 22:00.100
oh, he's very under the radar.

22:00.100 --> 22:02.200
only deals   with select clientele, so...

22:02.900 --> 22:04.900
i love it that you got a bagel guy.

22:05.500 --> 22:06.200
  oh, then wait  till i tell you

22:06.200 --> 22:07.900
about my cream cheese man.

22:11.300 --> 22:13.800
so are we gonna talk about this, where we're gonna live?

22:14.700 --> 22:17.700
   of course. i just don't think  we need to rush into this.

22:17.900 --> 22:19.500
don't have to rush into this?

22:20.200 --> 22:22.200
  well, you were the one trying on wedding dresses.

22:22.200 --> 22:24.400
wedding dress. singular.

22:24.400 --> 22:27.100
one dress--my mother's.

22:27.700 --> 22:30.500
i was really hoping that sam  could bpart of this discussion.

22:30.600 --> 22:32.200
i thinsam's fine.

22:32.500 --> 22:34.200
  if something was really bothering him,

22:34.500 --> 22:35.500
he'd clue you in.

22:45.500 --> 22:47.100
the may be the best bagels ever.

22:47.600 --> 22:49.100
where do you get 'em, ray?

22:49.700 --> 22:51.300
  uh, i got a guy, s..

22:52.800 --> 22:54.800
what did you do? what?

22:55.100 --> 22:57.100
  your hair. oh, i cut it.

22:57.100 --> 22:58.900
with what? your teeth?

22:58.900 --> 23:01.200
i think it looks cool. sam.

23:01.200 --> 23:03.300
what's the big deal? isn't this what we do--

23:03.500 --> 23:05.400
  big changes, shake things up,

23:05.400 --> 23:06.600
act without thinking?

23:09.100 --> 23:11.300
 okay, sit down. we need to talk.

23:11.300 --> 23:13.400
family meeting.   decisions have to be made.

23:13.400 --> 23:16.400
later, okay? i'm meeting doodie at the bowl-a-lot.

23:17.600 --> 23:19.300
i think he just clued me in.

23:22.600 --> 23:25.100
you know, nicky,   i slept better last night.

23:25.300 --> 23:26.700
i am well-rested and ready

23:26.700 --> 23:29.500
 for round two of the infidelity tour.  yeah?

23:29.600 --> 23:31.100
what did they do here?    more truck sex?

23:31.100 --> 23:33.500
more "pablo picasso"?

23:33.900 --> 23:35.000
give it to mraw.

23:35.100 --> 23:39.100
 no, nothing like that.   alison wanted to go dancing.

23:39.300 --> 23:41.500
oh. she's a great dancer.

23:41.700 --> 23:43.600
 yeah, well, she and ikey couldn't go out in public,

23:43.600 --> 23:46.800
so they came here, opened the car doors...

23:48.800 --> 23:50.200
and they danced?

23:51.700 --> 23:53.700
yeah, they danced.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.500
who comes to whiskey point to dance?

23:59.500 --> 24:01.500
  hannah and i used to do it all the time.

24:02.100 --> 24:05.500
   dancing--    it's just so... romantic.

24:31.900 --> 24:33.100
what is it?

24:34.900 --> 24:37.000
  i got a call    from the pre-med advisor.

24:37.900 --> 24:40.600
she wants me to take    a calculus class this summer.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.500
why do you have to take it this summer?

24:43.100 --> 24:46.600
  well, she said that not    knowing calc floors everybody

24:47.500 --> 24:50.000
and that i'd be    so far behind without it.

24:50.600 --> 24:52.400
can we still go to europe?

24:53.500 --> 24:54.900
well, you can, nick.

24:54.900 --> 24:58.100

25:04.800 --> 25:06.900
what was the song? huh?

25:06.900 --> 25:08.400
that they danced to?

25:09.700 --> 25:11.900
oh, uh, i dot know.

25:11.900 --> 25:13.200
 doesn't say. look, come on, nicky.

25:13.200 --> 25:14.800
if we're gonna do this infidelity tour,

25:14.800 --> 25:16.300
we're gonna do iall the way.

25:16.600 --> 25:19.200
you gotta find out the song.  call ikey.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
   call him.

25:28.500 --> 25:32.500
dude, my bad yesterday.    i'm really sorry.

25:32.500 --> 25:34.300
what was the ne   of the song, ikey?

25:34.300 --> 25:36.200
dancing? whiskey point?

25:38.100 --> 25:40.300
uh, it's not good.

25:40.300 --> 25:42.900
what's the song?! just--just tell me.

25:42.900 --> 25:45.500
pfft. remember that duran duran song

25:45.500 --> 25:47.600
that owen was obsessed  with in high school?

25:49.200 --> 25:51.600
 okay, thanks.

25:51.600 --> 25:53.100
but you can't tell him, nick.

25:53.100 --> 25:54.700
you can't break his heart like that. it'll kill him.

25:54.700 --> 25:56.300
that was his song   with buster.

25:56.700 --> 25:57.800
all right, good to know.

25:57.800 --> 26:01.100
nick, i'm begging you. don't ruin that song for him.

26:01.100 --> 26:03.200
don't do it. don't...

26:05.900 --> 26:06.900
 so?

26:08.300 --> 26:09.800
   what was the song, nicky?

26:12.300 --> 26:15.600
  backstreet boys. "shape of my heart."

26:19.100 --> 26:20.000
 really?

26:20.000 --> 26:21.200
really.

26:23.900 --> 26:26.300
   how goofy. thanks, buddy.

26:36.200 --> 26:38.200
so i guess that means   you're doing it.

26:39.100 --> 26:40.500
  dorky name and all?

26:41.100 --> 26:44.300
this from the owner-operator   of a "mr. loosey goosey's

26:44.300 --> 26:47.000
extremely pungent yumonade    lemonade stand"?

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
i was 6.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.900
exactly. what 6-year-old    knows the word "pungent"?

26:51.300 --> 26:53.500
 does this mean you and nick    are best friends again?

26:54.200 --> 26:56.100
  well, i don't know   about that.

26:56.600 --> 26:59.400
just couldn't walk by that sheet of plywood one more time.

27:00.500 --> 27:01.500
so what happened to you?

27:01.500 --> 27:03.700
lonnie the barber tippling on the job again?

27:03.900 --> 27:05.500
  i did this myself.

27:06.300 --> 27:09.900
oh. so it's you that's tippling on the job again?

27:09.900 --> 27:11.600
i don't get why  it's such a big deal.

27:11.800 --> 27:13.800
so i'm supposed to ask people what they think

27:13.800 --> 27:15.200
before i make a big change?

27:15.200 --> 27:16.500
hey, uh...

27:17.600 --> 27:19.600
 your ma and ray have   been together a long time.

27:20.400 --> 27:21.900
they're good for each other.

27:22.500 --> 27:23.400
you hate ray.

27:23.400 --> 27:24.900
well, yeah, but i ain't marrying him.

27:24.900 --> 27:26.200
 your ma is.

27:26.700 --> 27:28.000
i thought you liked  the guy.

27:28.300 --> 27:30.600
  i do. it's just...

27:30.600 --> 27:32.600
   now he's gonna be  my dad, right?

27:33.900 --> 27:36.400
well, your--your stepdad.

27:37.700 --> 27:39.900
you don't think they're   gonna have a baby, do you?

27:39.900 --> 27:42.600
hey, don't ask me.i don't even  know how to spell "pungent."

27:42.800 --> 27:45.200
well, hopefully this will be the last big change,

27:45.300 --> 27:47.800
at least for a little while, you know what i mean?

27:51.600 --> 27:52.700
yeah.

27:54.600 --> 27:56.000
i think i do.

28:08.200 --> 28:10.900
i just can't stop thinking about the backstreet boys.

28:10.900 --> 28:13.000
i mean, i may be a guy  who gets cheated on,

28:13.000 --> 28:15.600
but at least i got some musical taste, right?

28:15.700 --> 28:17.200
   sure, whatever you say...

28:17.700 --> 28:19.000
duran duran.

28:19.000 --> 28:20.800
oh, you remember that?

28:21.100 --> 28:23.600
yeah, that was your song   with buster.

28:23.600 --> 28:24.800
yeah.

28:33.000 --> 28:34.100
i get it.

28:34.300 --> 28:37.400
cheesy lava lamp,   free porn on cable.

28:38.600 --> 28:41.400
ooh, a vibrating bed.

28:41.400 --> 28:43.400
never actually seen one of these before.

28:43.400 --> 28:45.700
yeah, so they came here

28:45.700 --> 28:47.000
and they-- don't tell me.

28:47.000 --> 28:48.400
 i know. the...

28:49.100 --> 28:53.100
the weekend i took the kids    to see my parents in chatham.

28:53.900 --> 28:54.600
yeah.

28:57.100 --> 28:58.100
listen...

28:59.100 --> 29:01.800
an overnight doesn't exactly make me happy,

29:01.800 --> 29:04.000
but this whole confronting thing?

29:05.000 --> 29:06.100
it's working.

29:06.800 --> 29:08.500
physical phil was right.

29:09.900 --> 29:14.800
the anger, the pain-- it's starting to fade.

29:17.200 --> 29:18.900
owen,  get off the bed.

29:19.300 --> 29:22.500
this makes me sound like a robot.  owen, you don't understand.

29:22.500 --> 29:25.000
that does not compute.  owen.

29:26.500 --> 29:27.600
what's wrong?

29:29.000 --> 29:30.500
they didn't vibrate the bed.

29:30.500 --> 29:32.400
they didn't "pablo picasso."

29:32.400 --> 29:35.900
in fact, they didn't    have sex here at all.

29:36.500 --> 29:39.200
what else is there to do  in a seedy motel room?

29:44.400 --> 29:45.500
they talked.

29:46.200 --> 29:49.300
they talked? yeah, they talked...

29:49.900 --> 29:51.300
 all night long.

29:56.800 --> 29:58.300
  listen, sam, i know we sort of sprung

29:58.300 --> 30:00.000
this engagement on you,

30:00.200 --> 30:02.100
and it would be a lot for any kid.

30:02.100 --> 30:04.700
don't get me wrong. i like ray.

30:05.500 --> 30:08.500
it's just that i get scared sometimes, ma.

30:11.500 --> 30:14.300
well, it's the marriage part  that scares you, isn't it?

30:14.700 --> 30:15.900
a little.

30:16.900 --> 30:19.000
well, it scares me, too,  baby.

30:19.600 --> 30:22.300
but then i look to you 'cause you're my guy,

30:23.000 --> 30:26.400
and then when you get scared,  you gotta look to me, okay?

30:27.700 --> 30:30.100
  i just like knowing    what to expect every day.

30:31.300 --> 30:34.400
well, so do i,which is why i  think ray's really good for us.

30:34.800 --> 30:38.800
he's sweet, and he's kind,

30:39.300 --> 30:42.200
and he just adores you.

30:43.400 --> 30:45.600
  and with ray, we know what to expect every day.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.300
   not to mention,  really good bagels.

30:49.300 --> 30:50.800
not to mention.

30:52.400 --> 30:55.500
what could ikey possibly  have to say to alison

30:55.500 --> 30:58.000
for five minutes, let alone all night long?

30:58.000 --> 31:01.200
well, i think alison did most of the talking.

31:01.200 --> 31:04.800
they dance. they talk.

31:05.200 --> 31:06.800
they're like a real couple.

31:07.000 --> 31:08.400
she's pretty lonely here, owen.

31:08.400 --> 31:09.100
i know.

31:09.100 --> 31:10.700
i mean...

31:10.700 --> 31:13.000
 look, alison gave up  a lot when she married you--

31:13.100 --> 31:15.800
her friends, her job, her life in the city.

31:15.800 --> 31:17.000
and you got to keep everything,

31:17.000 --> 31:18.900
including, and i quote, 

31:19.100 --> 31:22.300
she says,"your goofy high school 3:00 on saturdays air band."

31:22.300 --> 31:24.800
if that's how she felt,  why didn't she tell me?

31:24.800 --> 31:27.800
she did, buddy, many times,   but you were--

31:28.000 --> 31:30.300
you're so convinced that youlife was perfect,

31:30.300 --> 31:31.400
u never heard her.

31:31.400 --> 31:33.900
and ikey did? well, ikey listened.

31:34.300 --> 31:36.500
 look, sometimes people just need someone to say,

31:36.600 --> 31:40.500
"i get it. i hear you.  that sucks."

31:40.500 --> 31:41.800
ikey did that,

31:41.800 --> 31:46.300
and for alison... that was everything.

31:51.000 --> 31:51.900
sorry.

31:52.400 --> 31:54.000
i do that, nicky.

31:54.800 --> 31:56.100
i get happy.

31:57.500 --> 31:59.000
 and when i'm happy,

31:59.200 --> 32:01.900
  i think everyone around me is happy, too.

32:01.900 --> 32:04.300
but i should've been  more aware.

32:04.500 --> 32:06.500
i should've    recognized the signs.

32:06.500 --> 32:09.400
i should have realized    that it's not normal

32:09.400 --> 32:11.300
for someone to cry for three hours

32:11.300 --> 32:13.600
after watching    "the sound of music."

32:14.300 --> 32:15.800
oh.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.600
i get it. i hear you.

32:21.100 --> 32:22.700
 that sucks.

32:24.500 --> 32:27.500
i never thought that this  was how it would all turn out.

32:29.300 --> 32:30.100
nick...

32:35.000 --> 32:36.400
you should  run with the bulls.

32:36.400 --> 32:37.500
 pamplona?

32:37.800 --> 32:40.000
only a couple people die each year, uh-huh.

32:40.400 --> 32:42.500
 and you're a fast runner, right? yeah

32:42.600 --> 32:45.200
i'm fast, but i'm not bull fast.

32:55.800 --> 32:56.600
what?

32:57.800 --> 33:00.200
i thought about it.   we planned this trip together.

33:00.200 --> 33:02.500
what's the point   of me going by myself?

33:02.500 --> 33:04.800
i know. believe me, i don't want you to go.

33:05.400 --> 33:07.000
i know more than anything.

33:08.400 --> 33:10.200
but it's only six weeks,

33:10.400 --> 33:12.500
and in the grand scheme   of things,

33:12.500 --> 33:15.500
i mean, what is six weeks, right?

33:16.700 --> 33:19.500
as long as i get to have you    for the next 60 years.

33:20.800 --> 33:21.800
 you do.

33:22.500 --> 33:23.800
i know i do.

33:24.100 --> 33:25.300
 oh, really?

33:26.100 --> 33:26.900
it's easy to let   something go

33:26.900 --> 33:28.700
when you know you're gonna get it back.

33:29.400 --> 33:31.600
i don't wanna go   without you.

33:33.000 --> 33:34.600
you have to go

33:36.500 --> 33:38.200
 remember what your mom said?  hmm?

33:38.700 --> 33:41.100
"unexpected adventures."

33:41.200 --> 33:43.400
it would kill me if i were the reason you didn't go.

33:45.400 --> 33:47.400
and if you ever get lonely,

33:48.600 --> 33:50.600
you just look up   at the moon

33:51.900 --> 33:54.000
and imagine us up there...

33:54.900 --> 33:56.400
on the beach...

33:57.200 --> 33:58.800
listening to the jukebox...

33:59.800 --> 34:01.300
eating spaghetti.

34:07.400 --> 34:09.400
i'll be thinking of you  all the time,

34:11.300 --> 34:12.800
but i have to let you go.

34:15.199 --> 34:16.100
nick.

34:16.300 --> 34:17.300
yeah?

34:18.100 --> 34:21.000
thanks, man... for everything.

34:22.000 --> 34:23.199
i'll never forget it.

34:25.000 --> 34:29.000
  i know all of this probably made no sense to you.

34:29.199 --> 34:30.500
you don't think so?

34:31.300 --> 34:33.300
  all i know  is that's the past,

34:33.300 --> 34:35.000
and when it comes   to the past,

34:35.600 --> 34:37.500
no matter   how much it hurts,

34:39.300 --> 34:40.400
  it's done.

34:43.300 --> 34:44.400
i get it.

34:45.300 --> 34:46.500
i hear you.

34:47.199 --> 34:48.600
that sucks.

34:50.500 --> 34:52.000
okay, i think it's time   to go home.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.199
* ordinary world *

34:54.199 --> 34:59.200
* somehow i have to find *

35:23.500 --> 35:24.500
what's up?

35:25.400 --> 35:26.400
hey.

35:26.700 --> 35:27.800
what goes on?

35:29.500 --> 35:31.600
how did the infidelity tour go?

35:33.300 --> 35:34.500
not sure.

35:35.900 --> 35:37.300
 i lied to owen.

35:37.900 --> 35:38.800
you lied?

35:39.400 --> 35:40.600
  just once.

35:41.100 --> 35:44.400
   isn't that a, uh, blatant flaunting of the rules?

35:44.800 --> 35:46.000
  yeah, but...

35:46.600 --> 35:49.500
 in this instance,    it was the right thing to do.

35:49.500 --> 35:51.100
i mean, the guy lost0everything.

35:51.100 --> 35:53.200
he doesn't need to lose duran dun, too.

35:55.200 --> 35:56.800
or he does.

35:57.600 --> 35:59.200
the details--they're just...

35:59.700 --> 36:02.400
  curiosities at this point,    if that.

36:03.700 --> 36:05.700
  so... you make a decision?

36:06.400 --> 36:07.700
are we partners?

36:12.200 --> 36:14.000
 i have something to tell you, nick.

36:15.000 --> 36:16.200
   okay.

36:17.800 --> 36:19.500
you're not gonna like it.

36:20.700 --> 36:21.900
 what is it?

36:33.500 --> 36:35.800
you spelled "friend" wrong.

36:36.300 --> 36:37.200
  huh?

36:39.600 --> 36:41.300
unbelievable.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.500
yay! yay.

36:51.300 --> 36:53.400
 this is for you. thought you might like it.

36:53.400 --> 36:54.500
thank you.

37:05.100 --> 37:06.600
well, look who it is.

37:06.700 --> 37:08.800
the cat burglar of dufresne college.

37:09.300 --> 37:11.200
 hey, i didn't steal    no cat.

37:12.300 --> 37:15.400
  so that's the next great nick garrett adventure, huh?

37:15.400 --> 37:17.200
the future is windows.

37:17.700 --> 37:19.700
yeah, i guess it is.

37:19.900 --> 37:21.300
that's good to know.

37:21.400 --> 37:22.900
that's really good  to know.

37:23.400 --> 37:24.600
why is that?

37:24.800 --> 37:26.900
'cause i just happen to be in the market

37:26.900 --> 37:28.500
for a new piece of glass.

37:28.600 --> 37:29.800
 is that so?

37:30.200 --> 37:31.300
'tis.

37:33.300 --> 37:34.200
i have to admit,

37:34.200 --> 37:36.400
kinda sad you're leaving   the college.

37:37.500 --> 37:41.400
i guess i'm just sorry i won't be seeing you as much.

37:41.500 --> 37:43.800

37:44.700 --> 37:45.900
