00:07.974 --> 00:08.908
How's your coffee?

00:08.908 --> 00:12.479
Oh, good. Good.

00:12.979 --> 00:13.913
Yours?

00:13.913 --> 00:14.981
Very nice.

00:14.981 --> 00:16.449
That's good.

00:16.449 --> 00:21.254
Marty... we have no reason
to be uncomfortable.

00:22.455 --> 00:24.891
We're two consenting adults.

00:24.891 --> 00:27.761
What about your husband?
He never consented.

00:27.761 --> 00:30.663
Stan loved you, Martin,
and he loved me.

00:30.663 --> 00:33.166
If anything,
he's up in heaven right now

00:33.166 --> 00:35.068
watching us and smiling.

00:35.068 --> 00:37.837
You don't think he was watching
the whole time, do you?

00:38.805 --> 00:40.807
Not if heaven gets ESPN.

00:42.175 --> 00:43.643
Come on, now,
stop feeling guilty.

00:43.643 --> 00:44.511
Okay.

00:44.511 --> 00:46.880
Hello, Dad!

00:46.880 --> 00:47.881
Oh, Fras!

00:47.881 --> 00:49.349
You remember Claire
Wojadubakowski?

00:49.349 --> 00:50.383
Yes, of course.

00:50.383 --> 00:52.185
Hello,
Mrs. Wojadubakowski.

00:52.185 --> 00:53.486
Good to see
you again.

00:53.486 --> 00:55.755
Gosh, I'm sorry again
about your loss.

00:55.755 --> 00:56.589
Oh, thank you.

00:56.589 --> 00:58.358
FRASIER: He was a good man,
your husband.

00:58.358 --> 01:00.126
Dad's often said
if it weren't for Stan,

01:00.126 --> 01:01.127
he wouldn't have made it
through the academy.

01:01.127 --> 01:02.629
Isn't that right?
That's right.

01:02.629 --> 01:04.631
And didn't he lend you
the money for you first car?

01:04.631 --> 01:06.666
Yeah... yeah,
he did.

01:06.666 --> 01:08.435
Of course,
we all owe him

01:08.435 --> 01:10.203
for introducing Dad
to Mom.

01:10.203 --> 01:12.005
Oh, God...

01:12.005 --> 01:14.641
You know, Marty,
I think we'd better go.

01:14.641 --> 01:15.408
Oh, of course.

01:15.408 --> 01:17.410
Well, Claire, it was lovely
seeing you again.

01:17.977 --> 01:19.946
Uh, please give my regards
to your son, Martin.

01:19.946 --> 01:22.348
Oh, God...

01:25.085 --> 01:26.019
Oh, hi, Roz.

01:26.019 --> 01:28.054
Hey, Frasier.
Why don't you join me?

01:28.054 --> 01:29.823
Well, aren't you
here with Niles?

01:29.823 --> 01:31.624
No. Actually, I haven't been
seeing much of Niles lately.

01:31.624 --> 01:33.059
He spends all his time with Mel.

01:33.059 --> 01:34.394
Uh...

01:34.394 --> 01:36.796
Well, that's what happens at
the beginning of relationships.

01:36.796 --> 01:38.098
Can I have a decaf latte,
please?

01:38.098 --> 01:39.899
Yes, and I'll have my usual.
Thank you.

01:39.899 --> 01:42.368
Gosh, I do hope he hasn't
forgotten me completely.

01:42.368 --> 01:43.703
We have wine club
tonight.

01:43.703 --> 01:45.505
I'm sort of counting
on him

01:45.505 --> 01:48.975
to help me
become Corkmaster.

01:48.975 --> 01:50.910
But you'll still keep
your secret identity

01:50.910 --> 01:53.313
as Frasier
Crane, right?

01:53.313 --> 01:56.216
Corkmaster is the most
prestigious position

01:56.216 --> 01:57.217
in our club.

01:57.217 --> 01:58.718
If elected, I plan to have
vertical tastings

01:58.718 --> 02:01.721
and guest speakers,
perhaps even a trip to Portugal

02:01.721 --> 02:04.090
where some of the world's
finest corks come from.

02:04.090 --> 02:05.992
I wish I had a cork right now.

02:05.992 --> 02:08.360
That's very funny, Roz.

02:08.360 --> 02:10.562
Anyway, I do hope
Niles shows up.

02:10.562 --> 02:12.465
You know, Mel has a way
of making him

02:12.465 --> 02:14.467
change his mind
at the last minute.

02:14.467 --> 02:17.303
You know, I think
she's a bit manipulative.

02:17.303 --> 02:18.905
Based on what?

02:18.905 --> 02:22.242
Well... I don't know, a feeling.

02:22.242 --> 02:24.077
So you really don't
know her that well?

02:24.077 --> 02:25.445
That's true.

02:25.445 --> 02:26.446
You know,
I really haven't given her

02:26.446 --> 02:27.881
much of a chance, I suppose.

02:27.881 --> 02:30.116
Well, I suppose
I could put together a...

02:30.116 --> 02:31.885
a little
get-to-know-you event--

02:31.885 --> 02:33.820
a-a Sunday brunch,
perhaps.

02:33.820 --> 02:36.723
There you go.
Yes, that's a good idea, Roz.

02:36.723 --> 02:38.158
Of course, I don't want
to make it seem

02:38.158 --> 02:40.160
like she's under
the family microscope.

02:40.660 --> 02:41.661
You know, maybe
you could come along.

02:41.661 --> 02:42.662
Oh, I guess I could.

02:42.662 --> 02:43.463
Great!

02:43.463 --> 02:46.366
Oh, and by Sunday,
you'll be Corkman.

02:46.366 --> 02:49.869
Corkmaster.
Thank you, Roz.

02:49.869 --> 02:50.870
Actually, I won't know

02:50.870 --> 02:51.871
until after the election
tonight,

02:51.871 --> 02:53.273
but you know,
I'll let you know.

02:53.273 --> 02:56.643
Or I could just look up
in the sky for the cork signal.

02:56.643 --> 02:57.944
Very amusing, Roz.

02:57.944 --> 02:59.846
If you win, I'd love a
ride in the Corkmobile.

02:59.846 --> 03:01.848
All right, Roz!

03:06.886 --> 03:09.856
(knocking on door)
MEL: Niles?

03:09.856 --> 03:12.859
Oh, don't you look
dashing!

03:14.761 --> 03:17.263
I brought you a nice bottle
of Cheval Blanc...

03:17.263 --> 03:19.098
Oh! ...to impress
the wine club.

03:19.098 --> 03:21.434
Mrs. Briggs gave it to me
as a thank-you

03:21.434 --> 03:23.870
after her last face lift.

03:23.870 --> 03:26.206
61? I don't believe it!

03:26.206 --> 03:29.576
Yes, that's what they're saying
about Mrs. Briggs.

03:29.576 --> 03:31.077
Oh, this is the
perfect occasion

03:31.077 --> 03:32.078
for me to bring
this wine.

03:32.078 --> 03:34.113
We're electing a new
president tonight.

03:34.113 --> 03:35.615
Oh?
Yes.

03:35.615 --> 03:37.617
And I promised
Frasier I'd nominate him.

03:37.617 --> 03:39.619
Oh, did I mention
brunch at Frasier's tomorrow?

03:39.619 --> 03:41.454
Oh, yes, darling.

03:41.454 --> 03:43.256
Well, I'm so happy
my rare and expensive bottle

03:43.256 --> 03:45.592
will benefit your brother.

03:45.592 --> 03:46.893
Oh, that tie's all wrong.
Let me?

03:46.893 --> 03:48.394
Yes, of course,
of course.

03:48.394 --> 03:49.896
Yes, well, uh,
ever since the day

03:49.896 --> 03:51.397
he joined the
wine club,

03:51.397 --> 03:53.766
Frasier's dreamed
of becoming Corkmaster.

03:53.766 --> 03:55.101
Oh...

03:55.101 --> 03:56.803
good choice.

03:56.803 --> 03:59.172
I think it's wonderful--
I really do--

03:59.172 --> 04:01.674
helping your brother win
this prestigious post.

04:01.674 --> 04:03.176
Well, Frasier deserves it.

04:03.176 --> 04:05.678
Because, uh, he knows more
about wine than you do.

04:05.678 --> 04:07.513
I wouldn't say that.

04:07.513 --> 04:09.382
Well, he's probably been
in the club longer.

04:09.382 --> 04:11.884
No, actually,
I sponsored his membership.

04:11.884 --> 04:14.387
Oh! Well, so you've
never wanted

04:14.387 --> 04:15.888
that honor for yourself?

04:15.888 --> 04:17.890
I wouldn't say never.

04:17.890 --> 04:18.891
Who hasn't nursed
the dream

04:18.891 --> 04:21.894
of one day becoming
Corkmaster?

04:21.894 --> 04:24.397
Well, I'm sure Frasier
at least asked

04:24.397 --> 04:26.899
if you were interested.

04:26.899 --> 04:29.902
Well, now that you mention it,
no, he didn't.

04:29.902 --> 04:31.371
Oh.

04:31.371 --> 04:34.173
And you don't
resent it?

04:34.173 --> 04:36.943
Well... you see,
that's why I love you.

04:36.943 --> 04:39.279
Because most
people would.

04:39.279 --> 04:42.148
I would... bitterly,
but then, I'm not you,

04:42.148 --> 04:43.650
and I don't know
what's best for you.

04:44.150 --> 04:45.485
And now the jacket's wrong.

04:46.886 --> 04:48.388
You think I should
call him on this?

04:48.388 --> 04:49.889
Oh, please, the last
thing I want to do

04:49.889 --> 04:52.825
is come between you
and your brother.

04:52.825 --> 04:55.261
He knows perfectly well
how much I've coveted this post.

04:55.261 --> 04:57.764
I distinctly confided
my aspirations to him

04:57.764 --> 04:59.265
the night Judge Rivington
fell off the ferry

04:59.265 --> 05:02.035
after the spring tasting.

05:02.035 --> 05:03.303
Well, I'm sure
he just forgot.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.305
No, no, don't
defend him.

05:05.305 --> 05:06.739
Here.

05:06.739 --> 05:08.308
He's always putting
himself first,

05:08.308 --> 05:09.809
and I always let him.

05:09.809 --> 05:10.810
Why, Niles?

05:10.810 --> 05:11.778
Oh, I don't know.

05:11.778 --> 05:12.779
I think perhaps
it's because...

05:13.279 --> 05:14.781
I'll tell you why.

05:14.781 --> 05:16.282
Because you can't
see yourself

05:16.282 --> 05:18.284
for what you really are.

05:18.284 --> 05:21.120
You are a powerful...

05:21.120 --> 05:22.955
sexy...

05:22.955 --> 05:28.728
dynamic colossus
of a man.

05:28.728 --> 05:30.096
In other words...

05:30.630 --> 05:35.101
the perfect Corkmaster.

05:35.635 --> 05:38.638
I am, aren't I?

05:38.638 --> 05:40.139
Don't let anyone...

05:40.139 --> 05:44.644
anyone ever take that
 away from you.

05:46.479 --> 05:47.980
And now that's all
I'm going to say,

05:47.980 --> 05:48.981
because I love you

05:48.981 --> 05:51.451
and I don't
want to meddle.

05:55.088 --> 05:57.590
FRASIER:
Oh, Niles, finally you're here!

05:57.590 --> 05:59.025
Sorry I'm late.
No, that's all right.

05:59.025 --> 06:00.593
It's just that the nominations
are about to begin.

06:00.593 --> 06:01.994
Now, look, here's
what I thought we would do:

06:01.994 --> 06:02.929
After you nominate me,

06:02.929 --> 06:04.931
I will demure modestly
for a moment

06:04.931 --> 06:06.699
and then I'll say
something like...

06:06.699 --> 06:08.301
I want to be Corkmaster.

06:08.301 --> 06:11.037
Well, that's a bit artless,
don't you think?

06:11.037 --> 06:14.273
No, no. I want
to be Corkmaster, too.

06:14.273 --> 06:15.975
I covet this post
as much as you do.

06:15.975 --> 06:18.611
I always have, and I think
I deserve a shot at it.

06:18.611 --> 06:20.880
But, Niles, I've been
campaigning for this all week.

06:20.880 --> 06:22.382
I was counting on
you to nominate me.

06:22.382 --> 06:23.683
And I will.

06:23.683 --> 06:25.485
I'm just hoping
that you'll return the favor...

06:25.485 --> 06:28.287
unless, that is, you're afraid
of a little competition.

06:28.287 --> 06:30.590
(silverware tapping glass)
May I have your attention?

06:30.590 --> 06:34.394
My friends,
as outgoing Corkmaster,

06:34.394 --> 06:36.729
I would like to thank
those of you who stuck with me

06:36.729 --> 06:39.999
during the ugly days
of Spritzergate.

06:39.999 --> 06:42.135
But the time
has come

06:42.135 --> 06:44.003
to pass the tasting cup.

06:44.003 --> 06:46.305
Are there any nominations?

06:46.305 --> 06:47.607
Niles?

06:47.607 --> 06:49.108
It is an honor
and a privilege

06:49.108 --> 06:51.944
to nominate my brother,
Frasier Crane.

06:51.944 --> 06:53.813
Fine.

06:53.813 --> 06:55.181
Any others?

06:55.181 --> 06:59.051
Yes. I would like
to, uh, reciprocate

06:59.051 --> 07:02.054
and nominate...
my brother,

07:02.054 --> 07:03.556
Niles Crane.

07:03.556 --> 07:05.525
CORKMASTER:
Oh. Well done.

07:05.525 --> 07:07.460
And are there any
further nominations?

07:07.460 --> 07:09.395
Well, then, um...

07:09.395 --> 07:10.329
a show of hands, please,

07:10.329 --> 07:12.665
for those in favor
of Frasier Crane.

07:12.665 --> 07:14.500
One, two, three,
four, five, six,

07:14.500 --> 07:17.270
seven, eight, nine,
ten, 11, 12, 13...

07:17.270 --> 07:18.571
14.

07:18.571 --> 07:21.374
And those in favor
of Niles Crane.

07:21.374 --> 07:23.042
One, two, three,
four, five,

07:23.042 --> 07:27.246
six, seven, eight, nine,
ten, 11, 12, 13.

07:27.246 --> 07:30.149
Oh! 14.

07:30.149 --> 07:32.452
(chuckling):
Oh, a tie.

07:32.452 --> 07:35.254
If only our venerable founder
Virgil Hefflewhite

07:35.254 --> 07:36.255
were here to guide us.

07:36.255 --> 07:37.723
VIRGIL:
I'm over here!

07:37.723 --> 07:41.227
Oh, sorry, Virgil.
I didn't see you.

07:41.227 --> 07:45.264
So, uh, what is
the procedure?

07:46.232 --> 07:49.168
Blind taste-off.
Five bottles.

07:52.104 --> 07:54.106
(spitting)

07:59.712 --> 08:01.681
FRASIER:
Oh, for God's sake, Niles!

08:01.681 --> 08:03.616
That wine spent less time
in the bottle.

08:03.616 --> 08:05.384
All right,
gentlemen,

08:05.384 --> 08:07.220
you have correctly identified
the first three wines.

08:07.220 --> 08:09.722
Let's see if number four
can break the tie.

08:09.722 --> 08:11.190
Niles?

08:11.190 --> 08:14.193
It was ripe, round
and thoroughly seductive.

08:14.193 --> 08:17.663
I said... Australian Shiraz.

08:17.663 --> 08:20.500
Uh-huh. And Frasier,
what did you think?

08:20.500 --> 08:21.868
Well, contrary to my brother,

08:21.868 --> 08:25.338
I thought it was dark,
dusky and supple...

08:25.338 --> 08:29.876
but I also said
Australian Shiraz.

08:29.876 --> 08:31.744
You're both right!

08:31.744 --> 08:33.712
We're still tied.

08:33.712 --> 08:35.214
Well, Niles...

08:35.214 --> 08:36.682
it's the moment of truth.

08:36.682 --> 08:38.583
Don't choke.

08:38.583 --> 08:39.952
Please. Prepare
to be stomped

08:39.952 --> 08:42.722
like a late-harvest
Gewurztraminer.

Gentlemen?

09:04.210 --> 09:09.715
It was jammy, plummy,
dense and chewy.

09:12.051 --> 09:13.352
There is no doubt in my mind

09:13.352 --> 09:16.322
that it was
a Napa Valley Merlot.

09:16.322 --> 09:17.723
(all gasp)

09:17.723 --> 09:19.225
And you, Frasier?

09:19.225 --> 09:22.028
A nice, big wine
with excellent heft.

09:22.028 --> 09:24.330
It's Napa, all right,
but as I always say,

09:24.330 --> 09:28.100
"Why go Merlot
when you can call a cab?"

09:28.100 --> 09:30.870
Well...

09:30.870 --> 09:33.339
I thought this bottle
might trip you up.

09:33.339 --> 09:39.211
Gentlemen, it's actually a blend
of 45% cabernet...

09:39.211 --> 09:39.979
And...?

09:40.780 --> 09:42.281
And 55% Merlot!

09:42.782 --> 09:44.183
Niles wins
by ten percent!

09:50.523 --> 09:52.892
Well, Niles,
congratulations.

09:52.892 --> 09:54.660
Obviously, the better
man won, and...

09:54.660 --> 09:56.295
Frasier, please.

09:56.295 --> 09:57.029
No, Niles,
don't be modest.

09:57.029 --> 09:57.830
No, I wasn't.

09:57.830 --> 09:58.731
They're starting
my inauguration.

10:00.600 --> 10:03.102
ALL:
♪ Hail Corkmaster ♪

10:03.102 --> 10:05.938
♪ The master of the cork ♪

10:05.938 --> 10:11.077
♪ He knows which wine goes
with fish or pork ♪

10:11.077 --> 10:15.381
♪ Hail Corkmaster,
the master of the cork... ♪

10:18.184 --> 10:20.519
The whole purpose of this brunch
is to get to know Mel better,

10:20.519 --> 10:21.787
but it irks the hell out of me

10:21.787 --> 10:24.290
preparing a-a sumptuous brunch
for Niles

10:24.290 --> 10:26.092
after the way he betrayed me
at the wine club.

10:26.092 --> 10:28.394
Oh, would you shut up
about that Corkmaster thing?

10:28.394 --> 10:32.898
I already hate you for putting
that song in my head.

10:32.898 --> 10:35.835
(hushed):
Okay, it's all clear.

10:41.374 --> 10:43.309
Thanks for dropping
off my Tupperware.

10:43.309 --> 10:45.378
Oh, oh, it's
no trouble at all.

10:45.378 --> 10:47.713
I was headed out
to church this morning...

10:47.713 --> 10:51.584
...and I thought,
"Oh, Marty's right on the way."

10:51.584 --> 10:54.353
What's the matter with us?
Oh, Martin,

10:54.353 --> 10:56.322
we have done nothing wrong.

10:56.322 --> 10:58.824
I mean, maybe we were
a little impetuous,

10:58.824 --> 11:01.193
but that's no crime.

11:01.193 --> 11:02.461
Yeah, I guess you're right.

11:02.461 --> 11:03.829
Well, listen,
thanks for dropping by,

11:03.829 --> 11:05.631
and-and I'll
call you.

11:07.900 --> 11:09.201
Mrs. Wojadubakowski.

11:09.201 --> 11:11.203
Yeah, look who
just got here!

11:11.203 --> 11:13.205
Come on in.
How are you?

11:13.205 --> 11:15.074
Fine, fine.

11:15.074 --> 11:16.976
I didn't even hear
the doorbell ring.

11:16.976 --> 11:18.944
What brings you here?

11:18.944 --> 11:20.946
Oh, she just, uh, brought me
back my chili bowl.

11:20.946 --> 11:21.947
Oh.

11:21.947 --> 11:23.949
Well, thanks a lot,
and I'll see you later.

11:23.949 --> 11:25.851
No, Dad, where
are your manners?

11:25.851 --> 11:27.253
Why don't you join us
for brunch, Claire?

11:27.253 --> 11:28.754
I insist.

11:28.754 --> 11:31.257
I'm not sure that we'll be able
to give you a treat

11:31.257 --> 11:33.726
as spicy as the one
that Dad gave you, but...

11:37.697 --> 11:40.199
Yes, he does make
very good chili.

11:40.199 --> 11:41.133
FRASIER:
Isn't that flattering, Dad?

11:41.133 --> 11:43.302
You know, I think
someone wants seconds.

11:46.072 --> 11:47.573
Uh, Fras, could I see you

11:47.573 --> 11:48.574
in the kitchen
for a minute?

11:48.574 --> 11:49.542
Yes, of course.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.010
Uh, Claire, you'll
make yourself at home.

11:51.010 --> 11:52.878
(chuckles)

11:53.713 --> 11:56.615
Oh, splendid idea, Roz--
Bloody Marys.

11:56.615 --> 11:58.784
You know, why don't you offer
one of those to Claire?

11:58.784 --> 11:59.618
Oh, I don't think
she's got time.

11:59.618 --> 12:01.120
I'll ask her.

12:01.120 --> 12:04.123
Mrs. Wojadubakowski,
Mr. Crane was wondering

12:04.123 --> 12:07.059
if you have time
for a quick one?

12:10.129 --> 12:12.131
Look, uh, Frasier,
there's something

12:12.131 --> 12:14.500
you should know
about me and Claire.

12:14.500 --> 12:17.303
We just slept together.

12:18.204 --> 12:19.739
Are you sure?

12:19.739 --> 12:22.641
She just got here
two minutes ago.

12:22.641 --> 12:24.043
She was here earlier.

12:24.043 --> 12:25.544
I just don't know
what came over us.

12:25.544 --> 12:27.346
You know, we couldn't keep
our hands off each other.

12:27.346 --> 12:30.149
We were like animals
or sex-crazed teenagers.

12:30.149 --> 12:31.650
Well, what's wrong
with that?

12:31.650 --> 12:32.651
Well, I'll tell you
what's wrong with that.

12:32.651 --> 12:34.453
She's Stan's widow.

12:34.453 --> 12:37.723
I mean, he didn't even like it
when I borrowed his lawn mower.

12:37.723 --> 12:38.691
Dad, listen,

12:38.691 --> 12:40.626
Stan's been gone a while now.

12:40.626 --> 12:42.128
I mean, you're not teenagers.

12:42.128 --> 12:43.129
You're two mature people
reaching out

12:43.129 --> 12:44.130
for some companionship.
(doorbell rings)

12:44.130 --> 12:46.098
I think it's adorable.

12:46.098 --> 12:48.100
"Adorable"?

12:48.100 --> 12:50.603
Oh, good morning,
Dr. Crane.

12:50.603 --> 12:51.904
Hello, Daphne.

12:51.904 --> 12:53.172
My, isn't that

12:53.172 --> 12:54.173
a beautiful outfit?

12:54.173 --> 12:56.175
Oh, thank you, Dr. Crane.
How sweet.

12:56.175 --> 12:58.144
So just beep me
if you need me.

12:58.144 --> 12:59.645
Oh, greetings, all.

12:59.645 --> 13:01.547
Uh, Mel, I think
you know everyone.

13:01.547 --> 13:02.815
Hello, Mel.
Hello.

13:02.815 --> 13:05.317
Oh, Mrs. Wojadubakowski,
what a nice surprise.

13:05.317 --> 13:06.819
Uh, this is
Mel Karnofsky.

13:06.819 --> 13:07.820
Hello.

13:07.820 --> 13:08.821
It's a pleasure
to meet you.

13:08.821 --> 13:11.657
Martin, I really have to be
getting to church.

13:11.657 --> 13:13.025
Oh, yeah, sure, okay.

13:13.025 --> 13:14.527
Well, I'll
just walk you out.

13:14.527 --> 13:16.028
And by the way,
I'm so sorry

13:16.028 --> 13:17.029
to hear
about your husband.

13:17.029 --> 13:19.398
Oh, thank you,
thank you.

13:19.398 --> 13:22.134
I understand Dad's been doing
what he can to fill the void.

13:24.003 --> 13:26.272
MARTIN:
See you.

13:26.272 --> 13:27.573
May I pour you

13:27.573 --> 13:29.308
a Bloody Mary, Mel?
MEL: Not for me.

13:29.308 --> 13:30.576
It's a little early in the day

13:30.576 --> 13:31.510
for hard liquor,
don't you think?

13:31.510 --> 13:35.314
Not anymore.

13:35.314 --> 13:37.216
Niles, let's get this
gravlax in the refrigerator.

13:37.216 --> 13:39.718
Oh, hello, Eddie.
Or should I say good-bye?

13:39.718 --> 13:42.121
Huh? Well, Martin,
I'm sure you'll be

13:42.121 --> 13:43.522
locking Eddie
out on the balcony

13:43.522 --> 13:46.258
if people are going
to be eating here.

13:46.258 --> 13:47.660
Boy, I'll tell you
who I'd like

13:47.660 --> 13:51.030
to lock out
on the balcony.

13:51.030 --> 13:54.700
Oh, please, let it be me.

13:54.700 --> 13:56.302
Now, now, may
I remind you

13:56.302 --> 13:58.103
that we are having
this little brunch

13:58.103 --> 14:00.005
in order to get acquainted
with Mel.

14:00.005 --> 14:02.208
We owe it to Niles
to give her a chance.

14:02.208 --> 14:03.509
I agree with
Dr. Crane.

14:03.509 --> 14:07.780
We should all have
another Bloody Mary.

14:07.780 --> 14:09.014
I didn't say that.

14:09.014 --> 14:11.317
It was implied.

14:11.317 --> 14:12.818
Oh, Frasier,

14:12.818 --> 14:13.619
I almost forgot.

14:14.053 --> 14:17.056
The Corkmaster and I
brought this along for you.

14:17.056 --> 14:18.557
Oh, well,
thank you very much.

14:18.557 --> 14:19.458
It's a lovely bottle.

14:19.458 --> 14:21.293
I guess, uh, Niles
must have told you

14:21.293 --> 14:22.828
about his
eleventh-hour victory.

14:22.828 --> 14:24.763
Oh, yes, and I'm
so proud of him.

14:24.763 --> 14:25.698
Well, let's
give credit

14:25.698 --> 14:28.601
where credit's
due-- to Mel.

14:28.601 --> 14:29.902
To Mel?

14:29.902 --> 14:32.204
Well, yes, it was her
idea that I should run.

14:32.204 --> 14:35.608
Really? Well... perhaps I'll
just put this around the corner

14:35.608 --> 14:39.545
before the cork flies out
and hits someone.

14:42.514 --> 14:44.016
So, after all
these years

14:44.016 --> 14:47.386
of doing tummy tucks
and liposuctions,

14:47.386 --> 14:49.822
I can look
at a fully-clothed person

14:49.822 --> 14:52.691
and see exactly
what they look like naked.

14:52.691 --> 14:55.995
I can see every
sag, droop,

14:55.995 --> 14:58.831
ripple and pucker.
(uncomfortable laughter)

14:58.831 --> 15:00.232
It's like X-ray vision.

15:00.232 --> 15:03.135
How interesting.

15:03.135 --> 15:06.438
I think I'll go
check on breakfast.

15:06.438 --> 15:09.241
Let me give you
a hand with that.

15:14.680 --> 15:16.181
When you invited me,

15:16.181 --> 15:19.018
did you say "brunch for Mel"
or "brunch from hell"?

15:19.018 --> 15:23.689
Oh! That woman
is unbearable.

15:23.689 --> 15:25.491
Well, guess
who's allergic to Eddie?

15:25.491 --> 15:28.427
She wants a glass of water
to take her pill with.

15:28.427 --> 15:29.762
You know what I can't stand?

15:30.229 --> 15:31.764
All that
"sweety-dearie-darling" stuff.

15:31.764 --> 15:33.632
I've never met anybody so phony.

15:33.632 --> 15:36.468
Hello, dear.
Here's your water.

15:36.468 --> 15:38.971
Thank you, Martin.

15:38.971 --> 15:42.374
Well, Frasier, I'm afraid
I have some bad news.

15:42.374 --> 15:45.678
Mm, I just got beeped
by my service and I have to go.

15:45.678 --> 15:47.346
Oh, gosh, I'm so sorry.

15:47.346 --> 15:48.180
Thank you for brunch,
though.

15:48.180 --> 15:49.682
Thanks for inviting me.

15:49.682 --> 15:52.184
It's such a civilized way
to spend an afternoon.

15:52.184 --> 15:55.187
♪ With her head tucked
underneath her arm ♪

15:55.187 --> 15:58.190
♪ She walks the bloody tower. ♪

15:58.190 --> 16:00.492
You know who that
song's about, don't you?

16:00.492 --> 16:01.627
Bloody Mary?

16:01.627 --> 16:03.362
Oh, don't mind if I do.

16:05.397 --> 16:07.700
Well, anyway,
I-I'd better go.

16:07.700 --> 16:09.034
Darling,
I have your coat.

16:09.034 --> 16:10.536
I'll walk you
to the elevator.

16:10.536 --> 16:14.340
Well, thank you all
for a lovely afternoon.

16:14.340 --> 16:15.574
Yes, bye, Mel.
Bye.

16:15.574 --> 16:16.909
FRASIER:
Lovely to see you.

16:16.909 --> 16:18.978
Well, that's
a blessing.

16:19.478 --> 16:20.980
Now we can enjoy
our breakfast.

16:20.980 --> 16:22.481
ROZ:
I doubt it.

16:22.481 --> 16:24.483
I was only allowed to make
a cheese-free,

16:24.483 --> 16:26.952
mushroom-free,
fat-free frittata,

16:26.952 --> 16:29.788
thanks to the girl
in the plastic bubble.

16:30.589 --> 16:33.058
I think
I'll order a pizza.

16:33.993 --> 16:37.496
You know...
I have half a mind

16:37.496 --> 16:38.497
to say something
to Niles.

16:38.497 --> 16:40.399
He is making a terrible
mistake with that woman.

16:40.399 --> 16:41.667
Now, Frasier...

16:41.667 --> 16:43.035
But, Dad, it is Maris
all over again!

16:43.035 --> 16:44.937
She's dominating him,
emasculating him.

16:44.937 --> 16:46.305
Look, I don't like her
any more than you do,

16:46.305 --> 16:47.806
and God knows we've been
through this before.

16:47.806 --> 16:50.342
I didn't like Lilith,
we both didn't like Maris,

16:50.342 --> 16:52.344
and you boys sure as
hell didn't like Sherry,

16:52.344 --> 16:54.213
but what good did it
do talking about it?

16:54.213 --> 16:56.081
But he's repeating
a terrible pattern.

16:56.081 --> 16:58.017
Well, he's going to repeat it
whether you like it or not,

16:58.017 --> 16:59.518
and if you say anything,
you're just going

16:59.518 --> 17:00.352
to drive a wedge
between you,

17:00.352 --> 17:02.988
so nobody's going
to say a word.

17:02.988 --> 17:05.156
Well, it's a shame
Mel had to leave.

17:05.156 --> 17:06.492
Oh, yeah, yeah.

17:06.492 --> 17:07.492
You know, we were having
such a good time.

17:07.492 --> 17:09.795
Yes, Niles.

17:09.795 --> 17:11.997
Actually, I was nervous
bringing her over here.

17:11.997 --> 17:14.066
I was concerned...
I was concerned

17:14.066 --> 17:15.067
what you'd think,
you know,

17:15.067 --> 17:17.368
getting to really know her
the first time.

17:18.137 --> 17:19.405
So?

17:19.405 --> 17:21.205
ROZ:
Ooh!

17:21.205 --> 17:23.541
I'm going to go let Eddie in.

17:23.541 --> 17:24.343
Come on, seriously.

17:24.343 --> 17:25.810
I-I-I-I want you
to be totally honest.

17:25.810 --> 17:26.811
Really. Tell me.

17:26.811 --> 17:28.313
What do you think
of Mel?

17:28.313 --> 17:30.582
Oh, I don't
like her at all.

17:30.582 --> 17:32.351
She's bossy and fussy and mean.

17:32.851 --> 17:33.819
She's all wrong for you.

17:33.819 --> 17:37.256
Yes, I need
a large pepperoni pizza.

17:37.256 --> 17:39.458
Yeah, and some
cheese bread.

17:39.458 --> 17:42.661
I'm sure
she didn't mean that, Niles.

17:43.529 --> 17:46.999
Well... that was startling.

17:46.999 --> 17:48.467
Yes, well, don't take
that seriously, Niles.

17:48.467 --> 17:49.468
You know how women
sometimes just form

17:49.468 --> 17:51.870
irrational dislikes
for one another.

17:51.870 --> 17:53.238
Oh! That's great.

17:53.739 --> 17:56.575
I leave the room for one second,
and you rat me out.

17:56.575 --> 17:57.943
No, Roz...
ROZ: No, that's okay.

17:57.943 --> 17:58.877
I don't have
anything to hide,

17:58.877 --> 18:00.312
and I'm not irrational.

18:00.312 --> 18:05.284
She's pushy, demanding
and a gigantic pain in the ass.

18:07.319 --> 18:11.790
I'd dump her
like radioactive waste.

18:11.790 --> 18:16.061
Well, so that's two of you
in the anti-Mel camp.

18:16.061 --> 18:19.264
Oh, did you tell him
what you thought of Mel, too?

18:22.101 --> 18:24.470
No, Daphne did.

18:24.470 --> 18:25.838
Oops.

18:27.673 --> 18:29.441
Frasier?

18:29.441 --> 18:31.310
I just think she's-she's
Maris all over again.

18:31.310 --> 18:32.311
She's manipulative.

18:32.311 --> 18:33.812
I think you're repeating
a terrible pattern.

18:33.812 --> 18:34.813
Oh, well,
isn't this neat?

18:34.813 --> 18:37.282
We all have our individual
reasons for disliking her.

18:37.282 --> 18:38.183
Hey, Dad,
what's your reason

18:38.183 --> 18:39.184
for disliking Mel?

18:39.184 --> 18:41.120
So you did tell him
what you think of her!

18:41.120 --> 18:42.488
And after shoving
me into the kitchen

18:43.021 --> 18:46.325
and shaking your
freakin' finger at me.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.261
She's crazy, Niles.

18:49.261 --> 18:50.662
I-I-I don't know
what she's talking about.

18:50.662 --> 18:51.997
No, no,
that's all right, Dad.

18:51.997 --> 18:55.000
I, uh... I asked you all
to be honest, and you were.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.001
I got my answer.

18:57.269 --> 18:59.104
You know, what would
have been nice

18:59.104 --> 19:01.106
is if one of you
could have found

19:01.106 --> 19:04.109
one nice thing to say about her.

19:10.749 --> 19:14.286
She does have
that X-ray vision.

19:23.262 --> 19:25.330
Did you talk
to Niles?

19:25.330 --> 19:28.834
Mm. I left a couple
of messages, but no answer.

19:29.334 --> 19:32.271
I think he's going to have
to stay mad for a while.

19:32.271 --> 19:33.205
Yeah, well,

19:33.205 --> 19:34.540
that was a hell of a brunch

19:34.540 --> 19:36.808
all the way around
for you as well as me.

19:37.609 --> 19:39.111
Dad, if you're talking
about what happened

19:39.111 --> 19:41.113
with you
and Mrs. Wojadubakowski,

19:41.113 --> 19:42.581
I mean, you have nothing
to be ashamed of.

19:42.581 --> 19:45.083
Yeah, yeah, I guess.

19:45.083 --> 19:46.585
So you're going
to see her again?

19:46.585 --> 19:48.086
Oh, I don't know.

19:48.086 --> 19:49.855
I don't think it's
going to work out.

19:49.855 --> 19:52.157
You're not still feeling guilty,
are you?

19:52.157 --> 19:53.525
MARTIN: No. What you said
made a lot of sense.

19:53.525 --> 19:56.195
I just think
it's run its course.

19:56.195 --> 19:59.031
Hmm. Well,
I have a theory.

19:59.031 --> 20:01.500
Oh, geez.

20:01.500 --> 20:03.535
No, no, hear me out.

20:03.535 --> 20:05.037
I think by giving you
my approval

20:05.037 --> 20:05.904
to sleep with Claire,

20:05.904 --> 20:07.773
I've made it
less exciting for you.

20:07.773 --> 20:09.708
There was a certain illicitness
to the relationship

20:09.708 --> 20:11.577
that gave it a kind of piquancy.

20:11.577 --> 20:14.479
Frasier, it's Sunday.
Take the day off.

20:14.479 --> 20:15.981
Wait, Mr. Crane,

20:15.981 --> 20:17.316
you slept with Mrs.
Wojadubakowski?

20:17.316 --> 20:18.584
Yes, I did.

20:18.584 --> 20:21.053
Isn't that adorable?

20:21.053 --> 20:24.389
No, it's disgusting,
you dirty old man.

20:26.158 --> 20:27.526
Sleeping with that poor widow

20:27.526 --> 20:29.461
before her husband's even cold
in the ground.

20:29.461 --> 20:30.729
You think that was wrong?

20:30.729 --> 20:31.463
You're damn
right I do.

20:31.463 --> 20:32.798
You ought to
be ashamed.

20:32.798 --> 20:35.000
See, I told
you, Frasier.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.903
We live in a
civilized society,

20:37.903 --> 20:40.272
and there are certain rules
we have to live by.

20:40.272 --> 20:45.877
We all have impulses we'd like
to explore, but we don't.

20:45.877 --> 20:47.579
Daphne?

20:49.982 --> 20:51.416
Well...

20:51.416 --> 20:53.819
we can't just go chasing
anyone you fancy

20:53.819 --> 20:56.288
just because you're suddenly
attracted to them.

20:56.288 --> 20:57.823
There are certain
things you don't do

20:57.823 --> 21:01.693
no matter how
tempted you are.

21:01.693 --> 21:03.895
Boy, that was strange,
wasn't it?

21:03.895 --> 21:05.230
I don't think
it was strange at all.

21:05.731 --> 21:09.234
It made a lot of sense to me.

21:09.234 --> 21:10.235
Where the hell
are you going?

21:10.736 --> 21:14.239
Well, I'd better get over
to Claire's and apologize.

21:14.239 --> 21:17.676
And, uh, don't wait up
for me, Frasier.

21:17.676 --> 21:20.779
I got a lot
of apologizing to do.
