         presents:

00:11.165 --> 00:13.220
Well, I'm gonna see your salmon

00:13.442 --> 00:14.679
and raise you two cod.

00:16.627 --> 00:18.438
What's this game called again?

00:19.012 --> 00:20.310
Stomp the wombat.

00:20.571 --> 00:21.978
Are you in or out, Kowalski?

00:27.693 --> 00:30.435
You know, in Tasmania,
cheating at stomp the wombat

00:30.560 --> 00:32.079
is a capital crime.

00:38.411 --> 00:41.288
That's funny. I didn't know we had
a hyena exhibit at this zoo.

00:41.456 --> 00:42.456
We don't.

00:48.555 --> 00:50.713
Bogey, 12:00. Blend, boys, blend.

00:59.318 --> 01:02.057
All right,
I better get you off to the hospital.

01:13.017 --> 01:13.860
Hello.

01:14.228 --> 01:16.362
Maurice, fill me in.
Three words or less.

01:16.530 --> 01:17.488
Well, I...

01:17.656 --> 01:20.033
- <i>No capiche</i>. Try 4 words.
- I don't think that...

01:20.201 --> 01:21.784
- Make it 5.
- Just listen...

01:21.952 --> 01:25.287
Okay, I'm gonna give you 6 words,
but you're wasting valuable time here.

01:25.455 --> 01:26.664
It's King Julien!

01:26.832 --> 01:28.916
They crated him off
to the zoo hospital.

01:30.217 --> 01:31.382
I need hug.

01:32.003 --> 01:33.608
He was just sitting on his throne,

01:33.733 --> 01:36.381
eating his favorite red lychee nuts
and then...

01:36.961 --> 01:38.675
He went full-speed loco.

01:39.058 --> 01:40.510
All slobbery mouth

01:40.678 --> 01:42.012
and crazy red eyes.

01:42.180 --> 01:44.514
So, sounds like business as usual.

01:44.682 --> 01:46.284
Oh, no. This was worse.

01:46.409 --> 01:49.488
And he had this horrible laugh.
I'll never forget it.

01:55.407 --> 01:56.910
You understand what I'm saying?

01:57.035 --> 01:59.531
So how long
until the royal pain recovers?

02:00.175 --> 02:02.209
I don't know.
I'm just an advisor.

02:02.403 --> 02:04.736
There has to be someone
for me to advise.

02:04.861 --> 02:06.390
There has to be a King.

02:07.453 --> 02:08.946
Ring-a-ding-ding, you're a King.

02:09.628 --> 02:10.628
Me?

02:11.082 --> 02:12.717
I'm just the King's right-hand man.

02:12.842 --> 02:15.608
And if the King's right-hand man
becomes the man,

02:15.733 --> 02:18.240
- then the King's left with no right...
- Listen up, soldier.

02:18.365 --> 02:19.655
Until ringtail returns,

02:19.780 --> 02:22.133
someone's gotta step up,
take charge around here.

02:22.301 --> 02:23.134
But I...

02:23.302 --> 02:25.355
It's either you or sad-eye.

02:28.932 --> 02:30.974
I guess it's on me
to look after things.

02:31.495 --> 02:34.655
But Julien will always be
our one and only King.

02:35.590 --> 02:36.590
There.

02:40.424 --> 02:42.527
We are looking dandy fine here, boy.

02:42.883 --> 02:46.544
When King Julien comes home,
this place will be sparkly fresh.

02:47.574 --> 02:50.065
He will be so happy.

02:50.489 --> 02:51.820
Yeah, say it.

02:52.165 --> 02:54.264
And we will be so tired.

02:59.294 --> 03:01.522
Can't just be sitting myself
on the royal throne.

03:01.647 --> 03:03.525
That would just be plain wrong.

03:05.849 --> 03:08.124
Then again... What's the harm?

03:09.459 --> 03:12.889
Mort, be a buddy and blow some more air
into our bounce house.

03:13.057 --> 03:14.640
If it's no bother, of course.

03:21.773 --> 03:24.169
You could see the whole zoo
from up here.

03:27.675 --> 03:29.112
Bet I could eat just one.

03:33.260 --> 03:34.667
That's pretty tasty.

03:35.522 --> 03:37.064
Maybe just one more.

03:37.623 --> 03:38.623
Or two.

03:40.457 --> 03:41.457
For the King.

04:11.195 --> 04:14.355
This next game was invented
by double-jointed Hungarian acrobats

04:14.562 --> 04:15.922
from the munich circus.

04:21.620 --> 04:23.622
You lemurs aren't big on knocking,
are you?

04:23.790 --> 04:25.040
Silence!

04:26.209 --> 04:27.597
I, Maurice,

04:28.265 --> 04:31.702
supreme King of the lemurs...
That sounds good...

04:31.827 --> 04:34.130
Demand that all animals swear

04:34.255 --> 04:37.578
their eternal loyalty to me, baby.

04:39.263 --> 04:40.263
Or else!

04:41.848 --> 04:44.924
Very funny, Maurice.
The whole power mad act is hilarious.

04:45.268 --> 04:47.853
- But we're in the middle of something.
- Help me.

04:49.100 --> 04:50.230
That Maurice...

04:50.398 --> 04:51.481
What a joker.

04:51.649 --> 04:55.610
I don't know.
That did not exactly sound like jollity.

04:55.778 --> 04:57.195
Did you see his eyes?

04:57.363 --> 04:58.728
"Or else", he says.

04:59.776 --> 05:01.191
Or else what, exactly?

05:05.657 --> 05:08.234
Move it.
Obey me, or suffer.

05:13.378 --> 05:16.338
All power lines run directly
under the lemur habitat.

05:16.506 --> 05:18.215
Right next to these water pipes.

05:18.582 --> 05:20.692
- Theoretically...
- Maurice has shut down power

05:20.817 --> 05:22.429
and water to all the habitats.

05:22.804 --> 05:24.179
He controls everything now.

05:25.101 --> 05:28.332
My theory was just about jerry-rigging
a giant makeshift hot tub.

05:28.457 --> 05:29.767
This is much worse.

05:29.935 --> 05:33.521
We are going in. Rico,
we don't have time to do this pretty.

05:41.863 --> 05:43.126
<i>Excelente</i>.

05:43.435 --> 05:45.506
Power and water controls at 6:00.

05:45.726 --> 05:46.783
Here we go on 3.

05:46.951 --> 05:48.035
One, two...

05:49.368 --> 05:50.368
Three.

05:52.625 --> 05:55.154
Well, the hot tub theory
is officially dead.

05:55.584 --> 05:58.488
What's your sick
and twisted game, Maurice?

05:58.796 --> 06:00.034
It's King Maurice,

06:00.159 --> 06:02.054
ruler of all I survey.

06:02.466 --> 06:06.427
Surrender to my supreme
and mighty power.

06:08.513 --> 06:10.693
Well, that's gonna be
a bit of a problem.

06:10.818 --> 06:13.798
You see, I don't know
the meaning of the word surrender.

06:14.703 --> 06:16.590
Surrender is a verb, Skipper.

06:17.065 --> 06:18.978
It means to give up or yield...

06:19.684 --> 06:20.857
Oh, right.

06:21.516 --> 06:22.984
Here. I'll do it myself.

06:23.701 --> 06:26.239
I will force you to obey me.

06:26.614 --> 06:27.864
You and what army?

06:31.438 --> 06:32.376
That army.

06:32.501 --> 06:34.441
Meet Bada and Bing,

06:34.566 --> 06:36.843
personal body guards to the King.

06:41.207 --> 06:42.377
We'll crush.

06:42.545 --> 06:43.545
Funny birds.

06:50.261 --> 06:52.136
Tell me you have an ace
up your sleeve.

06:57.935 --> 06:59.589
Wait for it.

07:07.819 --> 07:09.069
They're getting away!

07:13.060 --> 07:15.075
We got away.
Hooray!

07:15.243 --> 07:16.409
Wait, that laugh.

07:17.590 --> 07:19.496
It sounds like the one
we heard the other night.

07:19.664 --> 07:22.874
- It's just like...
- That deranged ringtail, Julien.

07:30.627 --> 07:33.880
Remember, men, we don't know
what kind of sorry shape he's in.

07:34.120 --> 07:35.719
Prepare yourselves for the worst.

07:43.506 --> 07:44.688
Visitors.

07:45.188 --> 07:47.436
Welcome to my luxury spa

07:47.561 --> 07:49.821
/retreat/getaway palace.

07:50.110 --> 07:51.275
Where's my candy?

07:51.686 --> 07:55.296
You, but you... You're fine.

07:55.421 --> 07:56.655
But of course.

07:56.823 --> 07:59.617
I am eating my lychee nuts
in one moment, an then,

07:59.785 --> 08:02.738
boingo, I am here
in the laps of luxury.

08:03.079 --> 08:04.621
Life is funny that way.

08:05.560 --> 08:06.540
It's the nuts.

08:06.708 --> 08:08.623
Red lychees go bad
and release an enzyme

08:08.748 --> 08:10.544
that amplifies aggression
in the brain.

08:10.927 --> 08:12.445
The nuts make you nuts.

08:15.037 --> 08:17.581
They gave me
this tasty guava berry milkshake

08:17.706 --> 08:20.160
and like that
I was feeling good all over.

08:23.559 --> 08:26.776
The tropical fruit
must counter the nutty enzymes.

08:26.901 --> 08:28.310
Of course.

08:28.478 --> 08:31.146
But if you are cured,
why are you still in the hospital?

08:31.314 --> 08:35.231
Because this vibrating bed
is awesome.

08:35.860 --> 08:39.652
Listen up. Maurice ate those bad nuts.
He went off the deep end.

08:39.777 --> 08:42.278
He's turned the lemur habitat
into an armed fortress.

08:42.403 --> 08:44.367
He's enslaved the entire zoo.

08:44.668 --> 08:46.786
I cannot be believing my ears.

08:47.095 --> 08:49.288
Maurice ate my lychee nuts.

08:50.376 --> 08:52.581
Guava berry cure in aerosol form.

08:53.126 --> 08:54.543
One whiff should do the job.

08:54.711 --> 08:57.504
This way. I know a secretest way
into my lemur Kingdom.

09:00.135 --> 09:03.301
Boys, desperate times
call for desperate measures.

09:04.554 --> 09:07.097
- What are you waiting for, ringtail?
- Who, me?

09:07.265 --> 09:10.114
I am going to be taking
the royal secret passage.

09:11.841 --> 09:13.841
But if you'd rather the potty...

09:14.577 --> 09:17.854
Far be it from me
to keep a penguin from water.

09:17.979 --> 09:18.941
See you later.

09:19.109 --> 09:20.473
Wait, we didn't know...

09:24.679 --> 09:26.424
I want those penguins found.

09:26.549 --> 09:28.321
Where are they? Where?

09:28.967 --> 09:31.536
Right here.
Your royal nutcase.

09:35.875 --> 09:37.000
Ringtail, now.

09:40.183 --> 09:43.172
The game is now
very much being over, Maurice.

09:43.514 --> 09:45.236
I, King Julien,

09:45.551 --> 09:48.260
the one most true glorious...

09:50.504 --> 09:52.973
- Shut up and just do it!
- What? What?

09:53.141 --> 09:57.060
Am I not entitled to a brief,
heroicish moment in my...

09:59.814 --> 10:01.773
Hey, you got the funny birds?

10:02.113 --> 10:03.900
Yeah, you got the mouthy squirrel?

10:04.760 --> 10:05.777
Over here.

10:06.136 --> 10:07.189
I win!

10:07.988 --> 10:09.947
I'm the ultimate ruler of the...

10:12.574 --> 10:14.744
Smell it, Maurice. Smell it up.

10:16.963 --> 10:18.237
Guava berry.

10:19.586 --> 10:22.467
Who would dare
wear the sacred crown of King Julien?

10:23.179 --> 10:24.179
Wait.

10:24.579 --> 10:25.379
It's me!

10:30.363 --> 10:33.094
I have no idea what any of these do.

10:36.250 --> 10:38.016
I am calling your bluff

10:38.630 --> 10:40.685
and raising you two
of the pineapples.

10:41.579 --> 10:45.246
I'm so embarrassed.
Did I really threaten to destroy you?

10:45.523 --> 10:47.762
Yes. On several occasions.

10:48.193 --> 10:49.624
But it wasn't your fault.

10:49.749 --> 10:50.843
It was the nuts.

10:50.968 --> 10:53.084
Just be glad it's all over.
