Since I was 14 years old, I
always wore cowboy boots.

00:12.080 --> 00:13.580
Maybe because my little boy role

00:13.581 --> 00:19.119
models were always the
men in the black hats.

00:19.120 --> 00:20.487
Richard Boone, Robert Vaughn in

00:20.488 --> 00:22.789
"the magnificent seven."

00:22.790 --> 00:23.491
Silent killers.

00:23.492 --> 00:25.292
Men with pasts.

00:25.293 --> 00:26.493
Men from somewhere else who

00:26.494 --> 00:30.930
found themselves in the
great American west.

00:30.931 --> 00:33.133
A place where reinvention, a new

00:33.134 --> 00:36.136
life was always possible.

00:36.137 --> 00:43.944
As long as you were
willing to kill for it.

♪

01:28.289 --> 01:31.358
The western myth has pretty
much captured the American

01:31.359 --> 01:31.792
imagination.

01:31.793 --> 01:33.193
None of us can escape it.

01:33.194 --> 01:35.228
For ages, we identified

01:35.229 --> 01:37.164
ourselves with the image of the

01:37.165 --> 01:42.235
lone cowboy, the perception
of frontier values,

01:42.236 --> 01:44.404
self-sufficiency, rugged
individualism, the freedom of

01:44.405 --> 01:52.405
wide open spaces.

01:54.315 --> 01:55.582
Few places in America still

01:55.583 --> 01:57.184
manage to embody that mythic

01:57.185 --> 01:58.385
landscape of the imagination

01:58.386 --> 02:03.223
like the state of new Mexico.

02:03.224 --> 02:04.891
What does freedom mean?

02:04.892 --> 02:07.394
It's different things to
everybody, it seems, but

02:07.395 --> 02:08.595
something about this place

02:08.596 --> 02:10.197
manages to capture the overlap

02:10.198 --> 02:11.831
between a whole hell of a lot of

02:11.832 --> 02:16.836
very different cultures.

02:16.837 --> 02:19.071
Old route 66 runs through new

02:19.072 --> 02:21.408
Mexico like a collapsed vein,

02:21.409 --> 02:24.611
right through Santa
Fe and Albuquerque.

02:24.612 --> 02:26.846
It must have seemed
like magic once.

02:26.847 --> 02:29.249
Families loaded in a massive

02:29.250 --> 02:32.118
chrome and steel char yachts

02:32.119 --> 02:35.255
with powerful v8 engines and

02:35.256 --> 02:36.623
took off down that highway.

02:36.624 --> 02:43.863
They swept in bungalows,
swam in kidney-shaped pools.

02:43.864 --> 02:45.898
Then it all went redundant.

02:45.899 --> 02:48.268
It was chopped up, largely

02:48.269 --> 02:51.070
forgotten, except by desperate

02:51.071 --> 02:53.072
and lazy travel show hosts.

02:53.073 --> 02:55.141
Does anyone else do this, drive

02:55.142 --> 02:59.879
around at like 10:15 at
night looking for tacos?

02:59.880 --> 03:00.281
Probably.

03:00.281 --> 03:00.881
I'll say this.

03:00.882 --> 03:02.449
The strip takes on a much more

03:02.450 --> 03:03.550
interesting look at night.

03:03.551 --> 03:06.719
You can imagine Dennis hopper

03:06.720 --> 03:08.288
huffing nitrous and dismembering

03:08.289 --> 03:11.291
somebody over an unrolled
tarp in any one of those

03:11.292 --> 03:13.760
sinister-looking motel rooms.

03:13.761 --> 03:14.094
Cool.

03:14.095 --> 03:16.263
Hopefully the tacos first,

03:16.264 --> 03:19.332
because after you do the meth

03:19.333 --> 03:20.433
you really aren't
going to want to eat.

03:20.434 --> 03:21.934
In ancient times, drivers would

03:21.935 --> 03:24.404
hang the testicles of their
enemies on their rear-view

03:24.405 --> 03:25.405
mirror mirrors.

03:25.406 --> 03:26.473
Best case scenario around here,

03:26.474 --> 03:28.475
in my humble opinion, taco

03:28.476 --> 03:30.310
truck, of which there
are quite a few.

03:30.311 --> 03:31.678
Parking lot, the smell of

03:31.679 --> 03:39.679
mystery parts on a griddle, yes.

03:40.921 --> 03:42.322
Knowing what I love of all

03:42.323 --> 03:43.690
things Mexican, you might expect

03:43.691 --> 03:48.127
me to be eating tacos
for the next hour.

03:48.128 --> 03:49.329
Without the wide stance.

03:49.330 --> 03:51.130
Damn you, tacos village.

03:51.131 --> 03:59.131
Come for the vistas,
stay for the tacos.

04:39.212 --> 04:41.047
30 rounds per magazine of

04:41.048 --> 04:43.182
steel jacketed destruction as

04:43.183 --> 04:51.183
fast as your finger
can pull the trigger.

04:51.759 --> 04:53.393
You might well ask yourself, why

04:53.394 --> 04:57.564
the hell would anybody
need a weapon like this?

04:57.565 --> 04:59.566
The Ar-15 is one of the weapons

04:59.567 --> 05:02.369
most reviled by gun opponents.

05:02.370 --> 05:04.771
It's also America's
favorite rifle.

05:04.772 --> 05:07.006
I never thought I'd say a guy

05:07.007 --> 05:09.208
from New York is a natural when

05:09.209 --> 05:10.843
it comes to shooting an Ar-15 in

05:10.844 --> 05:12.412
new Mexico, but I'm impressed.

05:12.413 --> 05:14.280
As a nation, we love them.

05:14.281 --> 05:15.748
There are about four
million in circulation.

05:15.749 --> 05:16.783
Those are the facts.

05:16.784 --> 05:20.219
Basically, Ar-15 is a
semiautomatic civilian version

05:20.220 --> 05:21.220
of an m-16.

05:21.221 --> 05:23.423
The funny thing is that in

05:23.424 --> 05:25.392
relation, this gun is almost

05:25.393 --> 05:26.593
identical to this gun, but this

05:26.594 --> 05:28.027
is the one that's evil.

05:28.028 --> 05:29.028
Shoots the same caliber, the

05:29.029 --> 05:31.464
same magazine capacity, just
looks a little different.

05:31.465 --> 05:33.032
I'm an east coast guy.

05:33.033 --> 05:34.033
I'm a new yorker.

05:34.034 --> 05:37.404
But I come from a place where a

05:37.405 --> 05:38.705
glimpse of a weapon on somebody

05:38.706 --> 05:41.307
at a bar is reason for panic.

05:41.308 --> 05:43.042
Here, in much of America in

05:43.043 --> 05:43.811
between New York and L.A., you

05:43.812 --> 05:46.546
walk into a bar, you see
somebody with a weapon, it's

05:46.547 --> 05:49.416
like that's my neighbor,
maybe he's going hunting.

05:49.417 --> 05:50.050
Who knows?

05:50.051 --> 05:52.051
Most of the people
you know own guns?

05:52.052 --> 05:54.621
Everybody I know.

05:54.622 --> 05:56.423
I had a rifle before I
had a baseball bat.

05:56.424 --> 06:04.424
Meet Jesse, bill,
Bo, and Daniel.

06:05.766 --> 06:06.734
Pretty much who we are talking

06:06.735 --> 06:11.438
about when we see the latest
stats on gun purchases in

06:11.439 --> 06:19.439
America and shake our
heads uncomprehendingly.

06:22.149 --> 06:24.651
That cultural divide, much more

06:24.652 --> 06:26.486
than policy, is what's kept the

06:26.487 --> 06:31.491
issue of gun control so
polarized and so, frankly,

06:31.492 --> 06:31.825
hopeless.

06:31.826 --> 06:33.693
He had a gun before he
had a baseball bat.

06:33.694 --> 06:34.662
I'm in the same situation.

06:34.663 --> 06:36.496
I was shooting a BB gun when I

06:36.497 --> 06:38.097
was 5 years old and I knew at

06:38.098 --> 06:39.365
that time it wasn't a toy, it

06:39.366 --> 06:41.468
was a weapon, and I was very

06:41.469 --> 06:43.470
well-educated by my father on

06:43.471 --> 06:45.972
the responsible use of
that piece of equipment.

06:45.973 --> 06:47.774
And that's what's
critical to me.

06:47.775 --> 06:49.509
I shoot all the time and I'm

06:49.510 --> 06:52.679
always trying to shoot
better than I did last week.

06:52.680 --> 06:54.313
It's relaxing.

06:54.314 --> 06:57.316
You're out with friends.

06:57.317 --> 06:57.885
It's fun.

06:57.886 --> 07:00.152
There's a dark little genie

07:00.153 --> 07:02.154
in all of us, I think, that

07:02.155 --> 07:04.524
wants to pick up a gun, point it

07:04.525 --> 07:05.892
at something, and blast away.

07:05.893 --> 07:08.628
This is a new Springfield arm

07:08.629 --> 07:12.565
nine millimeter
with 19 round clip.

07:12.566 --> 07:15.535
I like guns.

07:15.536 --> 07:18.170
I don't own a gun, but
I like holding them.

07:18.171 --> 07:20.206
I like shooting them.

07:20.207 --> 07:22.809
A Glock .22.

07:22.810 --> 07:25.812
It's cheaper than a 40 caliber.

07:25.813 --> 07:27.146
There is something compelling

07:27.147 --> 07:28.548
compelling, an eerie rush, a

07:28.549 --> 07:30.517
sense of empowerment feeling the

07:30.518 --> 07:34.554
warm glow of these heavy
iconic shapes in your hands.

07:34.555 --> 07:37.590
Get off my lawn, you kids.

07:37.591 --> 07:39.592
That's a 357 Magnum.

07:39.593 --> 07:40.727
Bigger kick on this guy.

07:40.728 --> 07:42.161
A little bit.

07:42.162 --> 07:45.732
You just can't help silently
mouthing "make my day" or

07:45.733 --> 07:53.733
"feeling lucky, punk."

07:56.777 --> 08:02.549
You could do this all day.

08:02.550 --> 08:04.383
Whatever your opinion on the

08:04.384 --> 08:06.586
subject, fact is, gun culture

08:06.587 --> 08:08.621
runs deep in this country.

08:08.622 --> 08:10.857
This is what I grew
up with, yeah.

08:10.858 --> 08:13.192
I shot my very first Turkey with

08:13.193 --> 08:15.962
this gun at 12 years
old, actually.

08:15.963 --> 08:17.964
That's a 22 rim fire cartridge.

08:17.965 --> 08:20.032
That is probably the type of

08:20.033 --> 08:21.634
firearm that most
kids start off with.

08:21.635 --> 08:23.636
These guys, I'm guessing, are

08:23.637 --> 08:25.972
not people I should
be worried about.

08:25.973 --> 08:26.574
They are nice.

08:26.575 --> 08:28.608
And exceedingly patient with a

08:28.609 --> 08:31.210
city boy who wants to
play with their guns.

08:31.211 --> 08:34.113
That there is a 338
Winchester Magnum.

08:34.114 --> 08:37.249
That's a big cartridge, heavy

08:37.250 --> 08:39.885
bullet for very large
game like elk.

08:39.886 --> 08:42.054
There's a target up
on that hillside.

08:42.054 --> 08:46.425
Can you see it?

08:46.426 --> 08:47.660
Now watch Mr. New York City

08:47.661 --> 08:50.296
liberal shoot that target out

08:50.297 --> 08:52.999
there from 244 wind-swept yards.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.601
Oh, wow.

08:54.602 --> 08:57.637
Now, am I accounting for windage

08:57.638 --> 08:58.805
dropping with distance?

08:58.806 --> 09:04.010
Yeah, you want to aim 13
millimeters to the left, four

09:04.011 --> 09:08.015
millimeters high and
you'll hit dead-center.

09:08.415 --> 09:08.749
Left?

09:08.750 --> 09:11.483
No, hold it right on.

09:11.484 --> 09:14.020
I'm just making a joke.

09:14.021 --> 09:19.258
Taking advantage
of the city boy.

09:19.259 --> 09:22.294
That wind's got to
be 20 miles an hour.

09:22.295 --> 09:27.634
Holding the rifle in this

09:27.635 --> 09:29.268
wind without a brace is tough.

09:29.269 --> 09:32.171
All eyes are on
you, no pressure.

09:32.172 --> 09:33.472
Pretty close, huh?

09:33.473 --> 09:39.478
May have been a hair left.

09:39.479 --> 09:47.053
A little high that
time, I think.

09:47.054 --> 09:49.488
A little right.

09:49.489 --> 09:51.290
Shooting real good,
though, Tony.

09:51.291 --> 09:54.927
You're not missing it by much.

09:54.928 --> 09:57.296
Exhale.

09:57.297 --> 09:57.698
Squeeze.

09:57.699 --> 10:02.068
The biggest thing is just
let it surprise you.

10:02.069 --> 10:04.536
As you're pulling the
trigger, squeeze it slow.

10:04.537 --> 10:06.505
Every time it goes off, it

10:06.506 --> 10:12.511
should surprise you, that
way you don't flinch.

10:12.512 --> 10:14.914
That looked right on.

10:14.915 --> 10:17.549
That looked right on to me.

10:17.550 --> 10:19.886
I'm proud of myself.

10:19.887 --> 10:21.821
I was somewhere in
the neighborhood.

10:21.822 --> 10:23.522
He's a natural.

10:23.523 --> 10:24.757
You think people that don't

10:24.758 --> 10:26.525
like the idea of guns, if they

10:26.526 --> 10:28.761
had a day out here shooting

10:28.762 --> 10:30.529
targets, I suspect a fair number

10:30.530 --> 10:33.399
of them would at least
temper their views somewhat.

10:33.400 --> 10:35.601
A thousand percent.

10:35.602 --> 10:36.003
Absolutely.

10:36.003 --> 10:36.704
You definitely get a respect

10:36.705 --> 10:38.537
for the power of it, for sure.

10:38.538 --> 10:42.541
Generally speaking, me and

10:42.542 --> 10:43.776
these guys I think should feel

10:43.777 --> 10:45.812
free to buy all
the guns we want.

10:45.813 --> 10:51.117
It's the rest of you
I'm not so sure about.

10:51.118 --> 10:52.919
Know how to shoot beer cans.

10:52.920 --> 10:56.923
If the zombie apocalypse
comes, I'll be ready.

10:56.924 --> 11:01.261
As long as they're
holding beers.

11:26.820 --> 11:28.755
So, when I grew up, when I

11:28.756 --> 11:32.158
was a kid, I played
cowboys and Indians.

11:32.159 --> 11:33.993
The cowboy myth had such a grip

11:33.994 --> 11:36.796
on Americans' self-identity.

11:36.797 --> 11:37.765
I remember.

11:37.766 --> 11:38.831
Playing cowboys and Indians, it

11:38.832 --> 11:40.232
was just part of the culture.

11:40.233 --> 11:45.905
You looked up to John
Wayne, Steve McQueen.

11:45.906 --> 11:47.406
My kid, 12 years old, wouldn't

11:47.407 --> 11:48.241
even think about cowboys.

11:48.242 --> 11:49.275
This is David.

11:49.276 --> 11:51.277
His family has lived here for

11:51.278 --> 11:52.478
generations, tracing their roots

11:52.479 --> 11:56.916
all the way back to the
Spanish conquistador.

11:56.917 --> 11:58.918
Those cliff walls out there,

11:58.919 --> 12:00.286
Tony, are 160 million years old.

12:00.287 --> 12:03.823
The ones at the
bottom, about 220.

12:03.824 --> 12:08.694
They're all the way back
to the Triasic area.

12:08.695 --> 12:11.831
And this is ghost ranch,
next door to David's spread.

12:11.832 --> 12:13.665
This is the area where Georgia

12:13.666 --> 12:15.634
O’Keeffe spent the last and most

12:15.635 --> 12:17.870
productive decades of her life.

12:17.871 --> 12:19.972
Now you've walked
through her painting.

12:19.973 --> 12:24.510
This is what she
called my country.

12:24.511 --> 12:27.679
Wasn't until my early 20s that I

12:27.680 --> 12:29.215
even knew who Georgia
O’Keeffe was.

12:29.216 --> 12:32.819
Grew up with her being
like a grandmother.

12:32.820 --> 12:33.853
It took me going into a gallery

12:33.854 --> 12:36.856
out there, I saw all
these paintings.

12:36.857 --> 12:39.025
I said why have you got
pictures of my house?

12:39.026 --> 12:42.228
She said please,
take a step back.

12:42.229 --> 12:45.832
That's Georgia O'Keefe's.

12:45.833 --> 12:48.167
It's just going to get prettier.

12:48.168 --> 12:51.838
It's just going to get prettier.

12:51.839 --> 12:57.309
One of O'Keefe's biographers
infamously described this

12:57.310 --> 12:59.078
landscape as garish, vulgar, and

12:59.079 --> 13:01.247
in poor taste, which if you look

13:01.248 --> 13:07.153
around is pretty
hard to comprehend.

13:07.154 --> 13:08.687
This is such the other side of

13:08.688 --> 13:12.892
the universe for somebody
who lives like I do.

13:12.893 --> 13:18.865
Live in cities, for whom
a backyard this big is

13:18.866 --> 13:19.266
inconceivable.

13:19.267 --> 13:20.499
The idea that there's a certain

13:20.500 --> 13:22.334
type of personality who's drawn

13:22.335 --> 13:24.170
towards open spaces like this.

13:24.171 --> 13:27.073
You know, this country, it

13:27.074 --> 13:35.074
either embraces you or within
a year it spits you out.

13:36.583 --> 13:37.950
We reached the end of our

13:37.951 --> 13:40.352
trail at a place called valley

13:40.353 --> 13:42.521
of thieves, once said to be a

13:42.522 --> 13:47.894
haven for infamous cattle
wrestlers, of course.

13:47.895 --> 13:51.763
They call it the rabbit.

13:51.764 --> 13:55.134
Ladies, you know what
I'm talking about.

13:55.135 --> 13:59.305
Jesus, I'm in my 50s.

13:59.306 --> 14:01.941
Find a distinguished segue into

14:01.942 --> 14:09.315
adulthood one of these days.

14:09.316 --> 14:12.551
Three generations are here
with me this evening.

14:12.552 --> 14:14.586
Herman, David, and Max.

14:14.587 --> 14:17.423
We'll do our best to put
together a little meal.

14:17.424 --> 14:22.962
Anybody want some coffee?

14:22.963 --> 14:25.797
Who am I kidding?

14:25.798 --> 14:31.070
I'm a city boy.

14:31.071 --> 14:34.273
Going to get all
Jack Palance here.

14:34.274 --> 14:36.142
We're also joined by Dan Flores,

14:36.143 --> 14:40.446
author of the book "horizontal

14:40.447 --> 14:44.416
yellow: Nature and history
in the southwest."

14:44.417 --> 14:46.852
How powerful are the
echoes from Spain?

14:46.853 --> 14:50.189
Spain was in control of new
Mexico for far longer than

14:50.190 --> 14:50.790
Mexico was.

14:50.791 --> 14:55.027
I think a lot of these new
Mexican families are ten

14:55.028 --> 14:56.628
generation and 11 generation.

14:56.629 --> 14:58.597
When they look back on
themselves, they think of

14:58.598 --> 15:02.101
themselves as Spanish.

15:02.102 --> 15:06.172
Those traditions, they've
continued to thrive in these

15:06.173 --> 15:06.974
little pockets.

15:06.975 --> 15:07.975
We're cut off from Spain.

15:07.976 --> 15:10.042
I once worked with people from

15:10.043 --> 15:12.844
Spain and they kept cutting
up, snickering at me.

15:12.845 --> 15:14.613
What they told me was okay, you

15:14.614 --> 15:19.618
can knock it off with the
Don Quixote phraseology.

15:19.619 --> 15:23.822
The equivalent of me today,

15:23.823 --> 15:26.025
would be top of the
morning to you, sir.

15:26.026 --> 15:27.226
They're like stop
making fun of us.

15:27.227 --> 15:28.195
I said you know what?

15:28.196 --> 15:29.695
I'm not making fun of you.

15:29.696 --> 15:30.997
That's the way we speak.

15:30.998 --> 15:33.032
We go see grandpa, that's all he

15:33.033 --> 15:35.034
knows is 500 year ago Spanish.

15:35.035 --> 15:37.869
Maybe if we're lucky enough,

15:37.870 --> 15:39.838
we'll have grandpa play his

15:39.839 --> 15:45.144
harmonica the way he used
to on the cattle drives.

15:45.145 --> 15:47.213
But I have a plan
here on this meat.

15:47.214 --> 15:48.880
All right, the meat is yours.

15:48.881 --> 15:55.854
All right, good.

15:55.855 --> 15:57.689
Just call me cooky.

15:57.690 --> 16:05.690
Some local beef, glowing
hot coals, cast iron can.

16:09.869 --> 16:12.871
Want to puree the
green chilies here?

16:12.872 --> 16:13.240
Yes.

16:13.241 --> 16:15.941
Beautiful.

16:15.942 --> 16:16.876
I'm going to throw those chilies

16:16.877 --> 16:19.945
in, stew it for a few
minutes, it will be good.

16:19.946 --> 16:26.085
I just need a few
splashes of an open beer.

16:26.086 --> 16:26.719
Beautiful.

16:26.720 --> 16:28.087
Check it off the Chuck wagon

16:28.088 --> 16:30.122
greatest hits, we've got some

16:30.123 --> 16:34.126
beans, potatoes, corn bread.

16:34.127 --> 16:35.461
We do our best.

16:35.462 --> 16:37.763
This is just about ready.

16:37.764 --> 16:39.731
Let's eat.

16:39.732 --> 16:40.567
Dig in.

16:40.568 --> 16:43.702
We done good, gentlemen.

16:43.703 --> 16:44.104
No kidding.

16:44.104 --> 16:44.704
Thank you, Tony.

16:44.704 --> 16:45.305
This is excellent.

16:45.306 --> 16:47.273
I'm wondering, you guys have

16:47.274 --> 16:49.141
been here for so long, your

16:49.142 --> 16:52.111
family, could you
live anywhere else?

16:52.112 --> 16:53.479
Not me.

16:53.480 --> 16:56.948
No, not me.

16:56.949 --> 16:57.717
This is home.

16:57.718 --> 16:59.285
I always get called back here.

16:59.286 --> 17:04.756
I visited Paris and lived in L.A.
for a while.

17:04.757 --> 17:06.157
Paris is pretty great.

17:06.159 --> 17:07.226
It's pretty great.

17:07.227 --> 17:08.960
But it's not here.

17:08.961 --> 17:13.132
I'm curious to know why you
chose... why you came here

17:13.133 --> 17:13.566
initially?

17:13.566 --> 17:14.501
Open space.

17:14.502 --> 17:15.767
Because I had grown up in a

17:15.768 --> 17:18.604
circumstance where you
couldn't see 50 feet.

17:18.605 --> 17:21.173
I mean, the forest was so dense.

17:21.174 --> 17:24.175
I used to climb up into the top

17:24.176 --> 17:26.112
of the tree on the highest hill

17:26.113 --> 17:30.316
just to be able to
see over the forest.

17:30.317 --> 17:31.084
So it was something about the

17:31.085 --> 17:33.352
idea of being able to see the

17:33.353 --> 17:35.254
landscape that
really compelled me.

17:35.255 --> 17:41.360
The big empty makes a real

17:41.361 --> 17:49.361
deep, deep sense to a
certain type of person.

18:03.550 --> 18:08.054
♪

18:35.315 --> 18:36.315
♪

18:56.236 --> 18:57.236
♪

19:13.853 --> 19:19.425
Since before 1598, grizzled

19:19.426 --> 19:20.626
frontiersmen and hearty pioneers

19:20.627 --> 19:23.229
have come to this unforgiving

19:23.230 --> 19:31.230
landscape to eke out a
difficult existence.

19:32.071 --> 19:34.072
Welcome to Santa Fe today.

19:34.073 --> 19:37.075
Where we can all live the
western dream and even buy a

19:37.076 --> 19:40.479
little piece of it to take home.

19:40.480 --> 19:41.880
You gotta love it.

19:41.881 --> 19:43.315
We pretty much eradicate the

19:43.316 --> 19:44.950
native American culture, and now

19:44.951 --> 19:46.652
in newer, more politically

19:46.653 --> 19:48.454
correct times, we decide we love

19:48.455 --> 19:51.590
Indians and all things
native American.

19:51.591 --> 19:56.161
And we're kind of, but
not really sorry.

19:56.162 --> 19:57.129
But that's not all.

19:57.130 --> 19:58.897
The new west is inclusive.

19:58.898 --> 20:00.666
Welcome to Santa Fe.

20:00.667 --> 20:02.301
You've got a whole spectrum

20:02.302 --> 20:04.303
of new age crystal types seeking

20:04.304 --> 20:05.304
spiritual purity and intensity

20:05.305 --> 20:08.574
in the harsh, yet
beautiful landscape.

20:08.575 --> 20:10.409
It's the last place in the U.S.

20:10.410 --> 20:14.280
You can wear buckskin and
fringe without irony.

20:14.281 --> 20:22.281
While holding a
Buddhist blanket.

20:23.290 --> 20:25.924
There is, very deep inside this

20:25.925 --> 20:28.126
ordinary-looking five and dime,

20:28.127 --> 20:36.127
something truly authentic.

20:37.003 --> 20:38.937
Frito pie and a soda, please?

20:38.938 --> 20:40.306
This is the Frito pie.

20:40.307 --> 20:41.940
As American as apple pie or the

20:41.941 --> 20:47.713
American project and
nearly as deadly.

20:47.714 --> 20:50.316
His or her Mel chili and
cheese-like substance dropped

20:50.317 --> 20:52.951
like a deuce, another roller in

20:52.952 --> 20:56.955
the night, right into
a bag of fritos.

20:56.956 --> 21:02.328
It feels like you're holding
warm crap in a bag.

21:02.329 --> 21:04.963
If you closed your eyes and I

21:04.964 --> 21:07.733
put this in your hand,
you'd be very worried.

21:07.734 --> 21:10.168
Yet, it is also delicious.

21:10.169 --> 21:12.571
Neither the Frito nor the Frito

21:12.572 --> 21:14.440
pie were indigenous
to new Mexico.

21:14.441 --> 21:17.175
They were actually Texan.

21:17.176 --> 21:18.977
New Mexico, you have
many wonderful things.

21:18.978 --> 21:23.749
Let Texas have this one.

21:23.750 --> 21:26.418
Self-loathing that usually takes

21:26.419 --> 21:29.555
a night of drinking to achieve.

21:29.556 --> 21:37.556
Tequila drinking
and a strip club.

21:41.834 --> 21:44.403
A warm, spreading glow fills my

21:44.404 --> 21:48.407
belly as I set out once more
in my mighty Ford galaxy.

21:48.408 --> 21:53.879
Yet I am also depressed.

21:53.880 --> 21:54.880
Frito pie.

21:54.881 --> 21:57.416
I smell metaphor.

21:57.417 --> 22:04.222
Speaking of explosive
diarrhea... did you know that

22:04.223 --> 22:06.525
the first ever atomic bomb was

22:06.526 --> 22:10.228
exploded in 1945 in the
desert of new Mexico?

22:10.229 --> 22:17.436
Sushi bars, galleries,
massage studios.

22:17.437 --> 22:17.704
Crystals?

22:17.705 --> 22:21.306
We got 'em.

22:21.307 --> 22:25.544
I think I need to adjust
my vent or something.

22:25.545 --> 22:27.679
I just see dark portents
in all of this.

22:27.680 --> 22:32.751
Well, there are a lot
of dark portents.

22:32.752 --> 22:38.624
This food will lighten
you up, I guarantee you.

22:38.625 --> 22:40.426
Horseman's haven cafe sits

22:40.427 --> 22:42.093
next to a gas station that is

22:42.094 --> 22:43.829
about as far away if the Plaza

22:43.830 --> 22:45.431
as you can get without leaving

22:45.432 --> 22:48.634
the Santa Fe city limits.

22:48.635 --> 22:52.838
It has a special feel of

22:52.839 --> 22:54.440
chilies grown specifically for

22:54.441 --> 22:56.908
this restaurant
and nowhere else.

22:56.909 --> 23:01.447
I meet back up with Dan
Flores for historical

23:01.448 --> 23:04.082
perspective over Santa Fe’s most

23:04.083 --> 23:04.851
beloved new Mexican fare.

23:04.852 --> 23:10.489
I know people who have
journeyed 300 or 400 miles to

23:10.490 --> 23:11.490
eat here.

23:11.491 --> 23:14.660
Enchilada with carne.

23:14.661 --> 23:16.962
Pork in reddened Mexican chili

23:16.963 --> 23:18.096
sauce with beans and rice.

23:18.097 --> 23:19.297
Got to have that.

23:19.298 --> 23:27.298
Some pasole, a stew made
from soaked hominy and pork.

23:27.339 --> 23:31.510
And sopapilla.

23:31.511 --> 23:33.378
Early cattle, railroad men, the

23:33.379 --> 23:34.680
people on their way to making

23:34.681 --> 23:38.116
this America, were they romantic

23:38.117 --> 23:38.851
about this part of the world?

23:38.852 --> 23:39.951
They thought of it
as a hard place.

23:39.952 --> 23:47.952
For one thing, it was
exceedingly remote.

23:48.695 --> 23:50.128
When you were here, this seemed

23:50.129 --> 23:53.965
like one of the farthest
reaches of the globe.

23:53.966 --> 23:58.504
Initially, Americans began
coming here because they

23:58.505 --> 24:01.339
perceived that Santa Fe was so

24:01.340 --> 24:04.710
remote from the rest of the
Spanish empire that it was

24:04.711 --> 24:06.812
possible for the United
States to pluck it.

24:06.813 --> 24:08.547
I don't think anybody becomes a

24:08.548 --> 24:13.351
romantic about it probably
until the painters arrive.

24:13.352 --> 24:17.823
Starting a long-running
tradition of artistic

24:17.824 --> 24:19.157
pilgrimages to catch the

24:19.158 --> 24:22.360
spiritual groove, every kind of

24:22.361 --> 24:24.530
utopian dreamer, eccentric, new

24:24.531 --> 24:29.034
ager, they all came here
in search of whatever.

24:29.035 --> 24:32.838
Mmm, chilies.

24:32.839 --> 24:35.373
That's level three.

24:35.374 --> 24:35.642
All right.

24:35.643 --> 24:37.008
We will be careful.

24:37.009 --> 24:39.410
New Mexican chilies come in

24:39.411 --> 24:42.013
two varieties... red or green.

24:42.014 --> 24:44.382
That's the state question in
new Mexico, red or green.

24:44.383 --> 24:45.951
Ordinarily, I like green.

24:45.952 --> 24:47.553
It's like Yankees or Mets.

24:47.554 --> 24:48.587
You've got to pick one.

24:48.588 --> 24:52.390
This green, however,
is not ordinary green.

24:52.391 --> 24:55.627
My face is burning off.

24:55.628 --> 24:56.596
This ain't normal.

24:56.597 --> 24:58.564
Oh, god.

24:58.565 --> 24:59.565
This hurts.

24:59.566 --> 25:00.966
I'm going to join you.

25:00.967 --> 25:05.771
Def-con one, two, three.

25:05.772 --> 25:07.272
It's a slow roll.

25:07.273 --> 25:11.577
First you think it's
going to be okay.

25:11.578 --> 25:13.078
Then it's not.

25:13.079 --> 25:19.818
There's nothing you can
do but wait it out.

25:19.819 --> 25:25.657
I believe they use the same
peppers in pepper spray.

25:25.658 --> 25:28.293
Or repelling grizzly bears.

25:28.294 --> 25:31.730
A shot glass of that will
put you in the hospital.

25:31.731 --> 25:32.498
No kidding.

25:32.499 --> 25:34.232
Everybody in the
restaurant seems so calm.

25:34.233 --> 25:35.601
Maybe they're not eating this.

25:35.602 --> 25:38.437
They're muffling their screams.

25:50.817 --> 25:53.619
History, they say,
belongs to the Victors.

25:53.620 --> 25:55.453
And here, where the myth of the

25:55.454 --> 25:56.922
American west took root, where

25:56.923 --> 26:00.325
so much romantic lore began,

26:00.326 --> 26:01.627
history was being rewritten

26:01.628 --> 26:03.662
almost as soon as it happened.

26:03.663 --> 26:05.263
This was never the big empty.

26:05.264 --> 26:07.666
As Dan Flores writes the idea of

26:07.667 --> 26:12.838
a wilderness is itself
a cultural construct.

26:12.839 --> 26:18.276
As early as 1539 when a
Franciscan friar reported

26:18.277 --> 26:20.511
sighting from a distance what he

26:20.512 --> 26:23.114
called the seven cities of

26:23.115 --> 26:24.850
cibola, these were interpreted

26:24.851 --> 26:29.721
as outposts of wealth,
possible cities of gold.

26:29.722 --> 26:31.690
Coronado, the famous Spanish

26:31.691 --> 26:32.958
conquistador, quickly dispatched

26:32.959 --> 26:40.959
an expedition and there
were indeed cities.

26:45.805 --> 26:46.673
Thank you for having us.

26:46.674 --> 26:50.575
The home of community
leader Ivan Pino.

26:50.576 --> 26:53.078
I'm here to join him and his

26:53.079 --> 26:55.781
nephew Robert and family
in a traditional hunt.

26:55.782 --> 27:03.782
So we'll be carrying
our shotguns.

27:06.525 --> 27:07.693
It's harder.

27:07.694 --> 27:11.529
It's always good to get a

27:11.530 --> 27:13.699
prayer going so that the animals

27:13.700 --> 27:21.700
can be willing to
take their life.

27:28.748 --> 27:29.915
The pueblo who lived here

27:29.916 --> 27:31.382
continuously since around 1250

27:31.383 --> 27:32.918
a.d. Had long before the Spanish

27:32.919 --> 27:35.721
or anyone else arrived a
highly organized society.

27:35.722 --> 27:38.423
They built multi-level
adobe apartment blocks.

27:38.424 --> 27:39.791
They farmed the land.

27:39.792 --> 27:41.727
Irrigated crops using intricate

27:41.728 --> 27:43.594
water diversion systems.

27:43.595 --> 27:50.435
All this in what sure as hell
looked like a harsh, and

27:50.436 --> 27:56.241
unforgiving land.

27:56.242 --> 27:57.776
This is good weather, though,

27:57.777 --> 27:59.811
for hunting because it's
a nice breeze, overcast.

27:59.812 --> 28:00.946
The breeze is beautiful.

28:00.947 --> 28:05.650
Not too hot.

28:05.651 --> 28:09.955
Pueblo long ago learned to
adapt to hard times, dry

28:09.956 --> 28:11.790
seasons, war, incursion.

28:11.791 --> 28:13.458
There were years where
there was nothing.

28:13.459 --> 28:16.795
And they had to deal.

28:16.796 --> 28:18.629
We found a pack rat.

28:18.630 --> 28:21.399
Our first pack rat.

28:21.400 --> 28:23.969
In preparation for the summer

28:23.970 --> 28:26.805
solstice ceremony, game like
rabbits and pack rats are

28:26.806 --> 28:27.839
collected for the medicine man

28:27.840 --> 28:30.075
as a payment for his services.

28:30.076 --> 28:31.810
How you notice is there's

28:31.811 --> 28:33.411
some droppings, fresh droppings.

28:33.412 --> 28:35.914
You see the droppings, you
know there's one around.

28:35.915 --> 28:37.282
This time of the day, they're

28:37.283 --> 28:38.649
going to be inside their homes.

28:38.650 --> 28:40.485
There's too many
predators around.

28:40.486 --> 28:41.020
It's not easy.

28:41.021 --> 28:45.924
Once you find a nest, you got to

28:45.925 --> 28:50.528
dig after the little
burrowing bastards.

28:50.529 --> 28:54.833
You hack, you dig.

28:54.834 --> 28:56.802
You dig some more.

28:56.803 --> 28:59.170
A lot of work for
a small rodent.

28:59.171 --> 29:03.942
I was just thinking that.

29:03.943 --> 29:06.044
That's what our ancestors
had to do sometimes.

29:06.045 --> 29:07.645
Right now there's this
drought going on.

29:07.646 --> 29:11.850
If we didn't have the
grocery stores... right.

29:11.851 --> 29:15.954
Then hopefully when you
flush one cleanly...

29:15.955 --> 29:17.688
Got it right here.

29:17.689 --> 29:18.657
Right.

29:18.658 --> 29:20.826
And give him a good
whack on the head.

29:20.827 --> 29:27.032
The ratio of work to protein.

29:27.033 --> 29:33.038
It's whiskers.

29:33.039 --> 29:34.840
To ensure a generation of

29:34.841 --> 29:37.508
this once vital source of food,

29:37.509 --> 29:41.079
tradition and ritual requires

29:41.080 --> 29:43.081
returning a part of the
animal back to the nest.

29:43.082 --> 29:50.688
I will never go hungry.

29:50.689 --> 29:53.091
Going for pack rats is really

29:53.092 --> 29:55.260
an homage, an acknowledgement of

29:55.261 --> 30:00.899
an important earlier time
when that was all there was.

30:00.900 --> 30:02.700
The 25-year great drought.

30:02.701 --> 30:04.769
As a city boy, I am greatly

30:04.770 --> 30:05.704
relieved these little critters

30:05.705 --> 30:07.505
are for the medicine man and we

30:07.506 --> 30:09.107
won't actually be
eating any of them.

30:09.108 --> 30:11.910
Instead, Linda, Ivan's wife, is

30:11.911 --> 30:13.378
preparing a pretty
traditional menu.

30:13.379 --> 30:16.547
Nothing is wasted when our
game is brought home.

30:16.548 --> 30:21.352
We dry up and
dehydrate the bone.

30:21.353 --> 30:23.188
Deer bone stew, red chili

30:23.189 --> 30:25.590
bone cooked with dried elk and

30:25.591 --> 30:30.095
potatoes, roasted dried
corn, and tortillas.

30:30.096 --> 30:33.098
And of course, more chilies.

30:33.099 --> 30:37.302
We call this disturb
pusharound chili.

30:37.303 --> 30:39.737
You push around until you
see the one you want.

30:39.738 --> 30:44.809
The chilies are a
state of magical.

30:44.810 --> 30:46.311
The seed has been passed on

30:46.312 --> 30:47.745
from generation to generation.

30:47.746 --> 30:49.314
They stay within the families.

30:49.315 --> 30:52.783
What percentage of young
people leave and don't come

30:52.784 --> 30:53.052
back?

30:53.053 --> 30:55.820
Not too many people will leave.

30:55.821 --> 30:56.555
Really?

30:56.556 --> 30:57.956
There are people who leave,

30:57.957 --> 30:59.925
but eventually there's this

30:59.926 --> 31:00.959
yearning inside you that you

31:00.960 --> 31:02.327
want to go home, you want to

31:02.328 --> 31:03.594
learn your culture, you want to

31:03.595 --> 31:04.762
be a part of everything.

31:04.763 --> 31:06.331
It would be an understatement

31:06.332 --> 31:08.333
to say the first Europeans who

31:08.334 --> 31:11.336
came into contact with Indians

31:11.337 --> 31:13.138
was destructive to the culture.

31:13.139 --> 31:17.142
And given that history,
how American do you feel?

31:17.143 --> 31:19.777
This village is unique in

31:19.778 --> 31:21.947
that we can easily just ignore

31:21.948 --> 31:23.581
everything that happens out

31:23.582 --> 31:25.350
there and just keep to ourselves

31:25.351 --> 31:26.952
here, and we do that sometimes.

31:26.953 --> 31:28.153
We close the road and we take

31:28.154 --> 31:29.787
care of our own business here.

31:29.788 --> 31:31.622
But it really varies
by individual.

31:31.623 --> 31:33.024
Maybe even by generation.

31:33.025 --> 31:35.360
We have a veteran, a veteran, a

31:35.361 --> 31:37.595
veteran that all served
in our armed forces.

31:37.596 --> 31:40.798
A big tradition of
serving in the military.

31:40.799 --> 31:41.967
Yes.

31:41.968 --> 31:45.103
We continue to be outdoorsmen.

31:45.104 --> 31:45.972
And we are survivors.

31:45.973 --> 31:48.206
I've dealt with the elements of

31:48.207 --> 31:52.043
the dust, the rain, the hail.

31:52.044 --> 31:54.445
But it made a better
person out of me.

31:54.446 --> 31:55.446
We are who we are.

31:55.447 --> 31:58.917
We're still going to be here.

32:25.211 --> 32:28.513
UFO activity.

32:28.514 --> 32:30.715
I don't need to be looking out

32:30.716 --> 32:37.088
my window to understand
they're behaving strangely.

32:37.089 --> 32:42.927
Injuries from the crash.

32:42.928 --> 32:50.928
Taken out into the desert
and they were buried.

32:58.110 --> 33:01.679
Look up in the dark, the

33:01.680 --> 33:04.515
night sky, uncontaminated by the

33:04.516 --> 33:09.087
light of any nearby cities,
you can see things.

33:09.088 --> 33:11.456
And of course, you've got a rich

33:11.457 --> 33:14.259
tradition of actual, real life

33:14.260 --> 33:16.061
spooky science fiction stuff.

33:16.062 --> 33:18.296
The Manhattan project in Los

33:18.297 --> 33:20.531
Alamos, nuclear missile silos

33:20.532 --> 33:22.733
hidden deep beneath
the desert floor.

33:22.734 --> 33:23.469
It's out there.

33:23.470 --> 33:26.104
So, where are we?

33:26.105 --> 33:28.073
Ground zero of where
everything seems to have

33:28.074 --> 33:28.574
started.

33:28.575 --> 33:31.476
Submitted for your approval.

33:31.477 --> 33:33.111
Norio and his friend James, two

33:33.112 --> 33:34.080
men associated with the new

33:34.081 --> 33:38.083
Mexico UFO and paranormal forum.

33:38.084 --> 33:43.288
This is where America's
rocketry actually started.

33:43.289 --> 33:45.090
At the end of world war ii,

33:45.091 --> 33:47.158
classified units of the CIA and

33:47.159 --> 33:48.493
army intelligence were busy

33:48.494 --> 33:50.928
sandbagging and sneaking away

33:50.929 --> 33:54.599
from probable prosecution,

33:54.600 --> 33:57.135
cadres of the world's
rocket scientists.

33:57.136 --> 33:58.769
Did I mention they were Nazis?

33:58.770 --> 34:02.107
Oh yeah, many of them
were sent around here.

34:02.108 --> 34:03.974
Other very mysterious things

34:03.975 --> 34:08.146
even took place,
allegedly, in 1947.

34:08.147 --> 34:09.514
1947, Roswell incident.

34:09.514 --> 34:10.116
That's right.

34:10.117 --> 34:11.949
That's still a mystery.

34:11.949 --> 34:12.751
Some say.

34:12.752 --> 34:15.585
You notice how they always say

34:15.587 --> 34:22.960
that in those dubious cheaply
reenacted doc shows.

34:22.960 --> 34:27.031
Back then they were working
on some pretty cool stuff.

34:27.032 --> 34:32.969
For instance, a Mylar-like
weather balloon.

34:32.971 --> 34:35.973
They would pancake out
like a flying saucer.

34:35.974 --> 34:38.275
Might that explain the excessive

34:38.277 --> 34:40.210
zeal and mysterious behaviors?

34:40.212 --> 34:42.780
If one of these things crashed
in the desert, you can

34:42.781 --> 34:46.184
understand a whole bunch of

34:46.185 --> 34:47.818
sinister-looking
bodies would show up.

34:47.819 --> 34:52.157
It's hard to say, but any

34:52.158 --> 34:54.192
military could create a
cover story for anything.

34:54.193 --> 34:57.862
Any pocket of, like,
cyborgs or aliens?

34:57.863 --> 35:01.199
I heard that there is and
then I've heard there isn't.

35:01.200 --> 35:02.867
We're taking you to a place,

35:02.868 --> 35:07.205
an undisclosed location, what's

35:07.206 --> 35:09.574
known as Albuquerque's
own area 51.

35:09.575 --> 35:11.142
There will be no
probing involved.

35:11.143 --> 35:12.577
Every time there's, like, alien

35:12.578 --> 35:13.811
stuff, there's always probing.

35:13.812 --> 35:14.845
Always with the probing.

35:14.846 --> 35:15.581
I don't understand.

35:15.582 --> 35:19.016
If they've been coming here for

35:19.017 --> 35:26.224
years, haven't they
done enough probing?

35:26.225 --> 35:30.395
If you were like on ghost
adventures, you'd be really

35:30.396 --> 35:31.596
playing this up.

35:31.597 --> 35:35.833
Some say this area was used
for sinister experiments,

35:35.834 --> 35:40.271
German-speaking cyborgs.

35:40.272 --> 35:42.240
Crack pot science.

35:42.241 --> 35:44.108
This is even better
than area 51.

35:44.109 --> 35:45.610
This is like area 61.

35:45.611 --> 35:47.845
Area 61 turns out to be a fenced

35:47.846 --> 35:50.881
off view of essentially
Kirkland air force base.

35:50.882 --> 35:54.252
The leading edge military
research development and

35:54.253 --> 35:54.553
testing.

35:54.554 --> 35:56.487
At night, there's
a lot of lights.

35:56.488 --> 35:58.223
It's a huge complex.

35:58.224 --> 36:00.525
Fact is, there was and still

36:00.526 --> 36:01.859
is some pretty cool stuff being

36:01.860 --> 36:05.363
tested out there in the desert.

36:05.364 --> 36:09.066
Maybe for DARPA or NSA
or the air force.

36:09.067 --> 36:10.435
Who knows?

36:10.436 --> 36:12.270
Do you think there are other

36:12.271 --> 36:14.639
life forms among us who
visited this planet?

36:14.640 --> 36:15.873
Yes, I do.

36:15.874 --> 36:16.874
What do you think?

36:16.875 --> 36:24.081
Well, personally, I have
a different opinion.

36:24.082 --> 36:26.150
It's a whole cover story in

36:26.151 --> 36:28.152
order to conceal certain kinds

36:28.153 --> 36:30.087
of projects, but I
could be wrong.

36:30.088 --> 36:35.893
I try to be a realist but
I'm open to anything.

36:35.894 --> 36:37.262
What is for certain and has

36:37.263 --> 36:39.330
been documented on film is that

36:39.331 --> 36:41.899
somewhere out there among the

36:41.900 --> 36:43.401
silos, underground cities,

36:43.402 --> 36:46.103
supposed nuclear waste dumps and

36:46.104 --> 36:48.105
alien burial ground, there is a

36:48.106 --> 36:52.910
large animal and a
hole in the ground.

36:52.911 --> 36:54.345
What strange beast even now is

36:54.346 --> 36:57.315
being loaded into a grave size

36:57.316 --> 37:01.820
pit in the desert for me?

37:29.815 --> 37:32.350
Well, I think one of the

37:32.351 --> 37:34.819
first things any society learns

37:34.820 --> 37:39.357
to do is dig a hole, throw
an animal in it, cook it.

37:39.358 --> 37:42.960
They call it around
here a matanza.

37:42.961 --> 37:45.463
One, two, three, up, up, up.

37:45.464 --> 37:48.999
It's pretty much an old-school
version of a barbecue

37:49.000 --> 37:50.968
in the sense that it involves

37:50.969 --> 37:54.372
burying a pig and the
imbibing of much alcohol.

37:54.373 --> 37:55.740
About 20 minutes from the

37:55.741 --> 38:02.347
nearest paved road
is dead horse ranch.

38:02.348 --> 38:05.182
People who made it has no

38:05.183 --> 38:09.354
shortage gathered to partake
in the festivities.

38:09.355 --> 38:10.988
There is beer here.

38:10.989 --> 38:12.757
Plenty of it, loelg
and delicious.

38:12.758 --> 38:13.559
And abundant.

38:13.560 --> 38:17.261
Did I say that?

38:17.262 --> 38:19.196
Have a drink.

38:19.197 --> 38:21.031
There are very tasty and lethal

38:21.032 --> 38:23.000
as it turns out margaritas and I

38:23.001 --> 38:24.669
believe to the best of my

38:24.670 --> 38:27.204
recollection anyway that I soon

38:27.205 --> 38:29.374
made the classic error of moving

38:29.375 --> 38:32.009
from margaritas of straight

38:32.010 --> 38:34.044
shots of Tequila and makes it

38:34.045 --> 38:35.780
easier to meet new people.

38:35.781 --> 38:39.517
Why is it that any time an alien

38:39.518 --> 38:43.253
visits like America, there's
always anal penetration

38:43.254 --> 38:43.522
involved.

38:43.522 --> 38:44.456
I never heard it before.

38:44.457 --> 38:46.290
Really?

38:46.291 --> 38:46.892
Ever.

38:46.893 --> 38:48.092
Am I into that?

38:48.093 --> 38:50.461
But the pig, the pig.

38:50.462 --> 38:58.462
What about that
body in the desert?

39:05.444 --> 39:07.645
For the last 17 hours.

39:07.646 --> 39:09.480
It looks delicious.

39:09.481 --> 39:11.048
Frank here he knows.

39:11.049 --> 39:15.119
He runs poncho's barbecue.

39:15.120 --> 39:16.421
Time to get slicing.

39:16.422 --> 39:19.624
I step in, help frank break my

39:19.625 --> 39:23.461
piggy friend down into
his constituent parts.

39:23.462 --> 39:23.795
Beautiful.

39:23.796 --> 39:26.831
First off go the legs, what
you call your fresh ham.

39:26.832 --> 39:28.332
Then your four quarter, your

39:28.333 --> 39:32.069
shoulders and what happen not.

39:32.070 --> 39:35.473
The loyal and rib
section, the pork belly.

39:35.474 --> 39:40.578
Nothing goes to waste.

39:40.579 --> 39:43.347
All that pig parts sent down the

39:43.348 --> 39:45.483
line to Harold who's been using

39:45.484 --> 39:52.590
them for new Mexico specialties.

39:52.591 --> 39:57.528
Now our 300-pound friend, none

39:57.529 --> 40:02.867
will go to waste, picked up with

40:02.868 --> 40:05.536
pisole, going into chili.

40:05.537 --> 40:07.705
Oh, yeah, that's going
to be beautiful.

40:07.706 --> 40:09.940
The tenderloin I set aside for a

40:09.941 --> 40:11.341
little time on the grill.

40:11.342 --> 40:16.514
Everyone here has put
in a lot of work.

40:16.515 --> 40:17.115
Time to eat.

40:17.116 --> 40:19.884
I didn't know the show was about

40:19.885 --> 40:21.886
this but I've been
thinking about it a lot.

40:21.887 --> 40:27.525
This sort of cowboys, Mexican,
Indian, romantic idea.

40:27.526 --> 40:29.393
A lot of easterners fell in love

40:29.394 --> 40:31.128
with this romantic notion of the

40:31.129 --> 40:32.497
west and wanted to come out here

40:32.498 --> 40:37.167
and sort of create their
own version of the west.

40:37.168 --> 40:39.570
Was that a good thing?

40:39.571 --> 40:44.909
That's what helps us as a
people, a native culture.

40:44.910 --> 40:48.579
We invite you to come and
enjoy what we partake in.

40:48.580 --> 40:50.815
I mean the Indians have the

40:50.816 --> 40:52.717
beans and the chili and corn and

40:52.718 --> 40:53.751
Spanish people brought the pork

40:53.752 --> 40:55.920
and brought that together
and have this meal here.

40:55.921 --> 41:00.157
People love the native culture,
they love the Hispanic

41:00.158 --> 41:01.026
culture here.

41:01.027 --> 41:02.560
It wasn't always that
way when I was younger.

41:02.561 --> 41:06.597
You played cowboys and
Indians as a kid.

41:06.598 --> 41:12.837
If there is one iconic hero
it is the lone cowboy.

41:12.838 --> 41:14.038
Any resonance.

41:14.039 --> 41:17.007
Mexican, Spanish, pueblo,

41:17.008 --> 41:20.410
reservation, white, we
all are cowboys here.

41:20.411 --> 41:23.848
A am a native new Mexican.

41:23.849 --> 41:25.382
I have gone through strange

41:25.383 --> 41:28.385
phases of my ownership of this

41:28.386 --> 41:31.388
place, weird mixed bag and
that is the identity.

41:31.389 --> 41:31.957
I don't know.

41:31.958 --> 41:34.258
It allows a certain freedom.

41:34.259 --> 41:40.230
My desire to wear cowboy
boots and wear a hat, you're

41:40.231 --> 41:40.632
okay with that.

41:40.633 --> 41:44.034
I would like to put my curse

41:44.035 --> 41:47.071
word kicking boots and a hat.

41:47.072 --> 41:47.639
Very kind of.

41:47.640 --> 41:49.039
You I got a question for you.

41:49.040 --> 41:51.976
What do you think of new Mexico?

41:51.977 --> 41:54.278
Kind of what are your thoughts?

41:54.279 --> 41:57.982
I'll try to boil it down
to a simple statement.

41:57.983 --> 42:00.651
If you come out to new Mexico

42:00.652 --> 42:01.986
you see metaphors in everything

42:01.987 --> 42:03.487
but actually if you were to

42:03.488 --> 42:05.055
stretch a little bit you could

42:05.056 --> 42:10.628
say that new Mexico is a
perfect metaphor for America.

42:10.629 --> 42:11.062
♪

42:11.063 --> 42:13.798
It is a total mutation.

42:13.799 --> 42:20.504
It's got Spanish, Mexican,
original American and add a

42:20.505 --> 42:23.608
tinge of radioactivity.

42:23.609 --> 42:25.676
This is what America is.

42:25.677 --> 42:29.313
An immigrant culture,
we are a gun culture.

42:29.314 --> 42:31.115
The expression of American power

42:31.116 --> 42:32.650
and identity has always been the

42:32.651 --> 42:34.685
lone cowboy with a gun.

42:34.686 --> 42:35.486
That goes deep.

42:35.487 --> 42:38.022
This is the heart of the

42:38.023 --> 42:45.797
American dream, love it
or hate it, this is it.
