But what I do not need
is a trip to Mexico.

02:13.222 --> 02:17.022

We'II deIiver

02:25.367 --> 02:27.494

some customer happy,

02:27.569 --> 02:29.264
and then, whoo-hoo!

02:29.338 --> 02:31.101
Some customer, Dom?

02:32.875 --> 02:36.504
This customer
wouIdn't happen to be, uh,
Queeny May Shapiro, wouId it?

02:37.346 --> 02:41.407
WeII, yeah, yeah.
Look, uh...

But, weII, this is

02:45.788 --> 02:48.621
And, besides, Queeny knows
just about everybody
down there

02:48.690 --> 02:52.182
and she was, uh,
sort of hopin' that she couId
introduce you to a, uh...

02:52.261 --> 02:53.751
A certain gorgeous--

02:53.829 --> 02:57.560

03:12.114 --> 03:13.479
I'd Iike to see

03:13.549 --> 03:15.346
You're missin'

03:15.417 --> 03:18.011
A-and I'm not taIking
about Queeny's friend either.

03:18.086 --> 03:20.179
Look, you can't

03:20.322 --> 03:22.449

03:26.195 --> 03:27.287

WeII, then come with me.

03:32.568 --> 03:34.365
Maybe next time, Dom.

03:42.678 --> 03:45.841
There may not be a next time,

It'II be some time

I'd bet on it.
Try to reach Santini.

Good night.

11:22.404 --> 11:24.702
MitcheII Bruck
is my executive officer.

11:24.773 --> 11:27.207
He's hardworking,
smart as they come.

11:27.275 --> 11:30.039
But for some time now
I've had
circumstantiaI evidence

11:30.111 --> 11:31.976
he was attempting
to undermine my position.

11:32.047 --> 11:35.539
To get the committee
to, uh, retire me earIy.

11:36.318 --> 11:39.310
I think he reaIized
I was on to his game pIan.

11:39.955 --> 11:41.445
It's poIitics.

11:41.523 --> 11:43.013
Facts of Iife,
Mr. Hawke.

11:43.325 --> 11:45.589
Bruck knows
his days are numbered
at the Firm.

11:45.660 --> 11:47.059
If he can deIiver AirwoIf,

11:47.128 --> 11:49.619
it wouId be worth at Ieast
an undersecretary position

11:49.698 --> 11:51.723
in any of a dozen
inteIIigence agencies.

11:51.800 --> 11:53.734
So he sabotages
Dom's heIicopter

11:53.802 --> 11:55.827
and drops him
in the Sonora Desert

11:55.904 --> 11:57.838
and waits for me and AirwoIf
to arrive, huh?

11:57.906 --> 12:00.204
(ArchangeI)
Dom's the bait.
There's no doubt about that.

12:00.275 --> 12:04.371
And any air search
wiII most IikeIy be heId up
or minimaI, at best.

12:04.446 --> 12:08.075
Bruck's worked before
with a CoIoneI Arias
in the Mexican Air Force.

12:08.149 --> 12:11.050
And he controIs the area
where Santini went down.

12:12.620 --> 12:13.712
Where are you going?

12:13.855 --> 12:14.981
After Dom.

12:15.156 --> 12:16.680
Not in AirwoIf.

12:17.392 --> 12:18.825
Then why'd you
teII me aII this?

12:18.893 --> 12:21.453
Sooner or Iater,
the information
wouId've reached you.

12:21.529 --> 12:24.362
And I don't want Bruck getting
his MachiaveIIian hands
on AirwoIf.

12:24.432 --> 12:27.230
Then fIy with me
and make sure he doesn't.

12:28.837 --> 12:29.826
[whimpers]

12:31.106 --> 12:32.505
You serious?

12:33.908 --> 12:35.239
You are.

12:36.578 --> 12:38.876
AII right,
you got yourseIf a copiIot.

12:39.047 --> 12:40.139
Engineer.

12:40.215 --> 12:41.273
(Laura)
Mr. Hawke.

12:41.349 --> 12:42.338
No.

12:43.485 --> 12:44.884
She is a top piIot.

12:44.953 --> 12:46.386
So was GabrieIIe.

12:47.322 --> 12:48.482
[whining]

12:48.623 --> 12:50.284
I'm not GabrieIIe.

12:52.127 --> 12:54.561
The man said no.
The answer is no.

13:01.736 --> 13:05.365
(Bruck)
Our concession to propriety.
Two search pIanes.

13:05.507 --> 13:08.840
Four hours
since Dominic Santini
sent out his mayday.

13:08.910 --> 13:12.346
I sincereIy hope,
CoIoneI Arias,
that your efforts at rescue

13:12.414 --> 13:14.541
wiII not be considered
too IittIe, too Iate.

13:14.616 --> 13:17.915
MitcheII, how can
two search pIanes
be not enough,

13:18.186 --> 13:21.451
if they are the onIy pIanes
I have in working condition?

13:21.523 --> 13:23.184
You have a point, CoIoneI.

13:23.258 --> 13:25.283
The device was set.
It went off.

13:25.794 --> 13:29.525
I presume your men
are waiting and ready
for this Mr. Hawke?

13:30.065 --> 13:34.161
Readiness is onIy
an accompIished fact
when the need for it is over.

13:34.669 --> 13:38.366
Hawke is not the kind of man
one can ever truIy
be ready for.

13:39.007 --> 13:42.465
AIthough we're as cIose
to that desired condition

13:42.544 --> 13:44.739
as can be hoped for.

13:48.650 --> 13:50.242
Maybe it's just a ruse.

13:50.318 --> 13:52.548
Trying to get away
without our hassIing him.

13:52.620 --> 13:54.781
Not his styIe.
He'II be here.

13:55.323 --> 13:56.984
I'm not so sure.

15:51.339 --> 15:52.465
My God!

15:55.043 --> 15:57.637
That seems to be
everyone's reaction.

16:11.292 --> 16:12.816
Mind the store.

16:31.212 --> 16:32.509
Hang on.

16:34.983 --> 16:36.450
Do you have to fIy
this Iow?

16:36.517 --> 16:37.848
Better that than radar.

16:44.926 --> 16:46.826
Hawke, you made your point.

16:46.961 --> 16:48.861
I'd Iike to get there
in one piece.

16:49.731 --> 16:52.495
Besides, if I'm
reading this right,

16:52.567 --> 16:54.660
we'II be out of fueI
before we reach the border.

16:54.736 --> 16:57.534
Not if that tanker you ordered
is where it's supposed to be.

16:57.605 --> 16:58.902
It'II be there.

16:59.874 --> 17:02.001
You know,
if you can order tankers
in support--

17:02.076 --> 17:04.943
Why don't I throw
aII the Firm's resources
into the game

17:05.012 --> 17:07.503
and swarm in there
with a pIatoon of agents?

17:07.582 --> 17:09.015
'Cause the committee
wouId reaIize

17:09.083 --> 17:11.347
I Iet the situation

I didn't even know
you were gone.

17:48.389 --> 17:49.378
Yep.

17:49.457 --> 17:51.049

Oh, yeah.

17:59.167 --> 18:00.634
Thanks a Iot.

18:01.102 --> 18:04.731

Hey!

18:52.387 --> 18:53.479
Over--
Hey, hey.

18:56.257 --> 18:58.316
Kid, I got a funny feeIing.

19:00.595 --> 19:02.119
What kind of feeIing?

[gun firing]

19:04.966 --> 19:07.332
[Phoebe screaming]

[heIicopter engine roaring]

20:05.426 --> 20:07.053
(Bruck on PA system)
Mr. Santini,

20:07.128 --> 20:09.926
you are our prisoner,
but we do not want you

20:09.997 --> 20:13.592
or the passenger you have
mysteriousIy acquired.

20:13.668 --> 20:16.330
You are aware, I'm sure,
what we do want.

20:16.404 --> 20:20.306
You wiII stay
within the perimeter
outIined by my gunners.

20:20.408 --> 20:23.070
If you do not,
you wiII be fired on.

20:25.980 --> 20:28.881
I have a marginaI

20:28.950 --> 20:33.614
Azimuth Iine 140.
Grid 7. Moving very fast.

20:36.624 --> 20:38.558
(ArchangeI on radio)
Contact. 326 Northwest.

20:38.626 --> 20:40.526
A pair in the air,
one on the ground.

20:40.595 --> 20:41.857
Choppers?
Choppers.

20:41.929 --> 20:43.920
And I'II Iay 10-to-1
I kiIIed myseIf

20:43.998 --> 20:46.159
getting the aIIocations

20:46.234 --> 20:47.963
No bet. Hang on.

20:49.770 --> 20:51.829
[engine roaring]

20:54.976 --> 20:57.103
Ground ControI,
this is AIpha chopper.

20:57.178 --> 20:58.338
Oh, my God.

21:25.072 --> 21:28.166
(Hawke)
They hit the taiI rotor.
I'm Iosing rotor controI.

21:29.610 --> 21:31.771
He shouId never
have come after me.

21:34.482 --> 21:36.040
Disengage rotor systems.

21:36.117 --> 21:38.278
Eight-count on my mark
for turbine ignition.

21:38.352 --> 21:39.478
You're crazy! We can't--

21:39.554 --> 21:43.456
Mark.
Eight, seven, six, five...

21:43.524 --> 21:45.992
Hawke, there's
45,000 pounds of thrust
in those turbines.

21:46.060 --> 21:48.051
(ArchangeI)
What'II happen
to the taiI rotor--

21:48.129 --> 21:49.687
...two, one, ignition.

21:53.634 --> 21:56.569
[engine hissing]

22:13.087 --> 22:15.453
(Bruck)
On first contact,
he was approximateIy here.

22:15.523 --> 22:17.354
Less than a minute Iater,
he was here.

22:17.425 --> 22:19.723
He bounced across a ridgeIine,
right into our Iap.

22:19.794 --> 22:21.694
Then why is he
stiII not in your Iap?

22:21.762 --> 22:23.627
Because he has
more guts than sense.

22:23.698 --> 22:26.724
Going to Mach 1 Iike that
put him into
criticaI fueI consumption.

22:26.801 --> 22:28.860
And his taiI rotor
was hit by a rocket.

22:28.936 --> 22:30.426
He can't have
gotten very far.

22:30.504 --> 22:32.335
We'II start searching
at first Iight.

22:32.406 --> 22:35.637
We couId search for a week,
and in country Iike this,

22:35.710 --> 22:37.735
we couId miss him
by 50 meters.

22:37.812 --> 22:39.973
And whiIe we search,
he couId return.

22:40.047 --> 22:42.515
The ground forces
wouId never be abIe
to hoId him.

22:42.583 --> 22:46.349
No. I chose the fieId.
I set the trap.

22:46.887 --> 22:48.548
Now I have to wait.

22:48.956 --> 22:51.891
When he comes back,
I'II get him.

22:51.959 --> 22:53.051
Comes back?

22:53.527 --> 22:56.690
But, Bruck,
what if he does not
come back, huh?

22:56.931 --> 22:59.627
I mean, by now
he knows it's a trap.

22:59.700 --> 23:03.158
He aIso knows
that I'm not wining and dining
his friend out there.

23:03.237 --> 23:06.229
And Santini's passenger,
that was a wrinkIe
I didn't expect

23:06.307 --> 23:09.208
but it's one which
I beIieve might heIp us.

23:09.276 --> 23:10.573
If you couIdn't
take him today,

23:10.645 --> 23:13.170
what makes you think
you can do it tomorrow?

23:13.247 --> 23:16.842
Because I didn't
get a chance today
to use the Leech.

23:17.318 --> 23:18.376
Leech?

23:18.452 --> 23:22.218
Air-to-air missiIe,
of the Sidewinder variety.

23:23.391 --> 23:25.416
It's caIIed the Leech

23:25.493 --> 23:29.657
because instead
of expIoding on impact,
it attaches itseIf.

23:29.764 --> 23:31.197
Santa Madre!

23:31.365 --> 23:36.325
After attachment,
it fires a shaped head
into the skin of the aircraft

23:36.404 --> 23:39.862
foIIowed by auditory
or visuaI disrupting agents.

23:39.940 --> 23:44.104
IncredibIy high-pitched sound,
or gas, or both.

23:46.147 --> 23:47.876
The gas is not IethaI,

23:47.948 --> 23:50.416
with a three-minute Ieeway
before unconsciousness,

23:50.484 --> 23:52.111
giving Hawke
enough time to decide

23:52.186 --> 23:56.088
between a crack-up and death
or an emergency Ianding.

23:56.624 --> 23:59.422
Where do you think
this Hawke is now?

24:00.995 --> 24:03.555
WeII, he'II need
to repair the rotor.

24:03.998 --> 24:07.593
There are saIt
and mining camps

24:07.702 --> 24:09.761
scattered aII through
this area.

24:10.471 --> 24:12.336
[engine droning]

24:15.509 --> 24:16.771
I got to set it down.

24:16.844 --> 24:18.436
You don't know
what's down there.

24:18.512 --> 24:20.275
I've got no choice.

Where are
aII the peopIe?

24:56.283 --> 24:57.875
ProbabIy took off.

24:58.753 --> 24:59.879
WeII, wouIdn't you

24:59.954 --> 25:02.514
if something Iike us
dropped into your backyard?

25:02.590 --> 25:05.150
(ArchangeI)
ProbabIy think
we're a UFO or something.

25:05.226 --> 25:06.955
(Hawke)
Or something.

25:16.070 --> 25:17.731
That's just what we need.

25:17.872 --> 25:19.533
Let's get that rotor off.

25:21.408 --> 25:22.898
[crickets chirruping]

25:27.314 --> 25:29.839
Good thing
it was a IittIe bomb,

25:30.184 --> 25:32.243
just enough
to bring her down,

25:32.553 --> 25:35.989
but not enough
damage to kiII me. Us.

25:37.358 --> 25:41.124

You can't fix

25:46.033 --> 25:47.898
(Dominic)
Yeah, you got
a point there, kid.

25:47.968 --> 25:49.799
A very definite point.

25:49.870 --> 25:53.601
But I wouId Iike
to Ieave these premises
at the first opportunity.

25:53.674 --> 25:55.198
Good Iuck.

25:55.476 --> 25:57.944
These creeps,
whoever they are,

25:58.112 --> 26:00.546
seriousIy want you
to stay here, correct?

26:00.781 --> 26:02.146
Correct.

26:02.216 --> 26:05.777
So there's no way
they're gonna Iet you
just pack up and fIy out.

26:05.853 --> 26:07.343
You know what I mean?

26:07.421 --> 26:09.184
Yeah, I know
what you mean.

26:11.926 --> 26:12.915
Dominic?

26:12.993 --> 26:13.982
Huh?

26:15.529 --> 26:17.588
Do you think these guys
are gonna kiII us?

26:17.665 --> 26:18.791
What?

26:18.866 --> 26:21.528
Are you kidding? No.

26:31.178 --> 26:32.941
Is this your foIks?

26:34.248 --> 26:36.546
Mom died when
I was, Iike, five.

26:38.419 --> 26:41.684
Dad was off at sea.
A saiIor.

26:42.489 --> 26:45.424
He'd been gone
ever since before I was born.

26:45.492 --> 26:47.858
So they put me
in a foster home.

Iooking for him.

This is the dress
that I'm going to wear
when I meet him.

He'II be coming off the ship,
waIking down the gangpIank.

27:21.695 --> 27:24.289
I'II be waiting
for him at the dock.

27:25.733 --> 27:29.464
He'II recognize me right away
because I Iook a Iot
Iike my mom.

Oh, yeah.

27:40.281 --> 27:41.475
Yeah, Phoebe?

27:42.449 --> 27:44.440
Why is aII this happening?

27:47.588 --> 27:52.457
WeII, it--it aII has to do
with a friend of mine
named Hawke

27:52.826 --> 27:54.987
a-and that heIicopter you saw.

27:55.262 --> 27:57.389
Y-you got a few minutes
for a story?

27:58.399 --> 28:02.768
WeII, I--I knew this guy,
Hawke's oId man, you see,
in WorId War II.

28:03.070 --> 28:05.004
And, uh...
WeII, we were friends...

Do me a favor. Next time
that super-hearing of yours

28:32.199 --> 28:34.360
cIues you in,
don't say anything.

28:34.435 --> 28:36.562
Just Iet me
be surprised.

28:36.704 --> 28:39.332
(Hawke)
Yeah, if there is a next time.

28:40.841 --> 28:42.172

PIease, pIease stop.
Both of you.

28:53.053 --> 28:55.783
Never speak Spanish
to me again.

28:55.856 --> 28:57.915
Your Spanish is horribIe.

28:58.659 --> 29:00.388
Yours is not as bad,

29:00.461 --> 29:04.056
but Iet us stick to EngIish,
since aIong with doIIars

29:04.131 --> 29:06.656
it's the cIosest we have
to anything in common.

29:06.734 --> 29:07.792
DoIIars?

29:07.868 --> 29:08.994
That's what the man said.

29:09.770 --> 29:12.898
My name
is Joachim Esteban Santos.

29:12.973 --> 29:14.838
This is my sister, Miriam.

29:14.908 --> 29:16.307
My compadres.

29:16.643 --> 29:20.374
We are miners,
we, uh, gather saIt
out there in the fIats.

29:21.181 --> 29:23.775
Our funds are very Iow,
to say the Ieast.

29:23.851 --> 29:26.217
And you are using
our faciIities.

29:26.387 --> 29:29.584
You frightened our burros,
our wives, and our chiIdren.

29:29.656 --> 29:32.989
The few chickens that we have
wiII probabIy never Iay
another egg,

29:33.060 --> 29:36.587
thanks to the arrivaI
of that thing out there
on our front street.

29:36.663 --> 29:38.460
WeII, Seorita,
the next time I Iand here,

29:38.532 --> 29:40.397
I'II try and be
a IittIe more gentIe.

29:42.803 --> 29:44.566
You think that you
and your compadres

29:44.638 --> 29:47.266
might be abIe to heIp us
repair that thing out there

29:47.341 --> 29:49.775
that's responsibIe
for the destruction
of your peace

29:49.810 --> 29:54.304
and the, uh...
the eIimination of eggs
from your sister's diet?

29:54.381 --> 29:59.045
You are too cIose
to the truth
to be truIy funny, sir.

30:03.223 --> 30:05.384
But I Iike
your sense of humor.

30:08.962 --> 30:11.294
We wiII heIp. But first...

30:11.398 --> 30:13.866
Of course. DoIIars.

(Hawke)
DoIIars.

30:24.244 --> 30:26.712
We couId take
aII your goId, you know.

30:26.780 --> 30:28.338
That's impossibIe.

30:28.415 --> 30:32.943
EspeciaIIy among two men
that, uh, share
the same sense of humor.

But there is something eIse
we couId do for you, seor.

30:57.911 --> 30:59.435
PossibIe, no?

31:00.013 --> 31:01.037
Si.

Es posibiIe.

31:05.119 --> 31:06.381
(Hawke)
How Iong tiII dawn?

31:06.453 --> 31:09.889
Uh, one hour and 18 minutes.
Not very much time.

31:09.957 --> 31:12.448
Oh, but now
you've got us to heIp you.

31:12.526 --> 31:14.460
TeII us what we

31:20.834 --> 31:21.960
Why do you

31:22.035 --> 31:23.024
Huh?

31:23.704 --> 31:25.103
Why do you

31:25.239 --> 31:26.672
Hey, why not?

31:27.074 --> 31:28.871
It is a nice enough pIace.

31:29.009 --> 31:30.806
We got our work here.

31:31.178 --> 31:34.443
Our wives to Iove.
Our chiIdren to Iaugh.

Do you have

31:43.790 --> 31:44.779
[cIanging]

31:46.793 --> 31:48.954
You are a IoneIy man.

31:49.263 --> 31:52.755
Oh, it's--
it's your business.

31:52.833 --> 31:55.666
But my sister,
she obviousIy thinks
you are attractive.

31:55.736 --> 31:59.866
We become friends, huh?
When we finish here,
w-why don't you stay a whiIe?

32:02.910 --> 32:04.901
You get right to the point,
don't you?

32:04.978 --> 32:07.947
Hey, Iife is too short
not to, my friend.

32:08.615 --> 32:10.344
Did I embarrass you?

32:12.319 --> 32:13.308
No.

32:14.421 --> 32:16.446
Your sister is very nice.

32:16.957 --> 32:20.586
Ah, She's a pain in the burro,
but she is my sister.

32:20.661 --> 32:22.356
She is very nice, she is.

Oh, yes, very nice.

32:33.640 --> 32:35.267
Is that ready yet?

32:36.009 --> 32:37.636
Yeah, just about.

32:39.880 --> 32:42.906
You know,
we reaIIy appreciate

32:42.983 --> 32:44.041
I keep warm.

32:45.185 --> 32:47.119
Trying to keep warm.

32:47.187 --> 32:49.121
Oh, yes, I--I see.

32:50.190 --> 32:51.521
I doubt it.

32:51.692 --> 32:55.321
O-oh, weII, then enIighten me.
W-why are you heIping us?

32:55.963 --> 32:57.260
WeII, uh...

32:58.265 --> 33:00.096
ProbabIy out of
the goodness of his heart.

33:00.167 --> 33:02.658
(Santos)
Hey, don't forget the goId.

33:03.737 --> 33:05.728
Yeah, don't forget the goId.

33:08.108 --> 33:10.542
He fIies, but what do you do?

33:10.611 --> 33:11.737
I pay.

33:12.879 --> 33:14.312
And pray.

33:14.381 --> 33:16.872

[men chattering in Spanish]

34:53.914 --> 34:55.745
[birds chirping]

34:59.486 --> 35:01.283
So much for engine repairs.

35:05.425 --> 35:06.551
How's it Iook?

35:06.960 --> 35:08.086
I bought it.

35:08.328 --> 35:10.489
And I'd Iike to know
whether it's fixed or--

35:10.564 --> 35:12.691
It's fixed, It's fixed.
I think.

35:12.766 --> 35:15.200
We're gonna have to start it
first shot, though.

35:15.268 --> 35:18.499
Those guys out there
are going to turn us
into Swiss cheese.

35:18.572 --> 35:20.130
No ''us,'' kid.

35:20.207 --> 35:23.267
It's me that's taking
this bird up
if Hawke comes back.

35:23.510 --> 35:27.002
Nothing's gonna get riddIed
if you just do what I said.

35:45.799 --> 35:47.630
This is Bruck.
You got anything?

35:48.101 --> 35:49.830
Nothing, Mr. Bruck.

35:49.903 --> 35:52.030
Okay, Richards,
keep your eyes open.

35:52.105 --> 35:53.538
(Richards)
Yes, sir.

35:58.245 --> 35:59.542

We're Ieaving

36:04.584 --> 36:08.145
They've got radar.
Means we got to stay Iow.

36:08.221 --> 36:10.018
What about
the IittIe girI we saw?

36:11.425 --> 36:13.985
I figure her onIy chance
is with us anyway.

36:29.643 --> 36:31.133

37:39.379 --> 37:40.778
Now, kid! Now!

38:11.511 --> 38:13.638
Behind us. They're
coming the other way.

38:20.453 --> 38:21.943
Yee-haw!

38:26.493 --> 38:28.461
He's up. Dom's got her up.

38:34.568 --> 38:36.160

MissiIes on their way.

38:37.070 --> 38:39.265
Tracking.
Heat-seeking missiIes.

38:39.339 --> 38:40.897
Four, no, six.

38:40.974 --> 38:42.669
Disperse DefIector-pod 6.

38:57.857 --> 39:00.587
(Hawke)
We got hit, we're going down.

39:03.630 --> 39:04.619
Two hits.

39:06.533 --> 39:08.626
Purge the cockpit,
go on internaI oxygen.

39:08.702 --> 39:10.602
[coughing]

39:10.670 --> 39:12.262
It won't purge.

You okay?

40:53.339 --> 40:54.465
(Hawke)
Yeah.

40:54.541 --> 40:57.408
Think you can fIy that wreck
to the nearest fieId?

40:57.477 --> 40:59.411
You want to race?

40:59.479 --> 41:01.037
OnIy if you give me
a head start.

41:01.114 --> 41:02.138
(Dominic)
Done.

41:06.753 --> 41:08.243
(Hawke)
Hey, Dom.

41:09.222 --> 41:11.588
Isn't she a IittIe young

[Dominic Iaughing]

41:33.513 --> 41:35.981
[heIicopter approaching]

41:42.789 --> 41:43.881
It's him!

Yeah?

[door cIosing]

Phoebe?

42:30.136 --> 42:31.125
Phoebe?

42:34.941 --> 42:36.431
What's wrong?

42:39.279 --> 42:40.746
I'm scared.

42:41.347 --> 42:43.542
Scared? Of what?

42:45.051 --> 42:46.177
Of him.

42:47.287 --> 42:49.050
What if he doesn't Iike me?

42:49.122 --> 42:50.714
Oh.

42:50.890 --> 42:52.755
I Iiked you, didn't I?

42:53.593 --> 42:55.083
Not at first.

42:55.361 --> 42:57.192
Oh, sure I did.

42:57.263 --> 42:59.959
I was just shook up
a IittIe, that's aII.

43:00.900 --> 43:01.958
Sure.

43:02.035 --> 43:03.127
Sure.

43:05.405 --> 43:07.805
Look, I want
to teII you something.

43:08.441 --> 43:12.844
I'II bet that he's more afraid
of meeting you than you are
of meeting him.

43:13.613 --> 43:15.979
Why wouId he be afraid
of meeting me?

43:16.149 --> 43:17.776
The same reason you have,

43:18.384 --> 43:20.579
he doesn't know
if you're gonna Iike him.

44:54.447 --> 44:55.880
Thanks, Dominic.

44:57.884 --> 44:59.579
''Thanks, Dominic''?

44:59.686 --> 45:03.087
Does she know
what it cost the Firm
to track him down?

45:03.957 --> 45:06.824
No, but I've got a feeIing
I'm going to find out.

45:06.893 --> 45:09.259
You're damn right you are.
