02:37.075 --> 02:39.508
Oh, man. All right,

02:39.510 --> 02:41.043
It's so hard.

02:41.045 --> 02:43.213
Let me get out of here.
Go, all right, bye-bye-bye.

02:43.215 --> 02:45.448
Okay, bye.

02:45.450 --> 02:49.317

in background)

03:08.039 --> 03:09.873
Hmm.

03:09.875 --> 03:11.306
Oh!

03:11.308 --> 03:12.745
Today...

03:14.645 --> 03:17.380
today Mommy gets
her life back.

03:17.382 --> 03:19.181
(dog grunts)

03:19.183 --> 03:21.750
Yes, wish me luck. Mwah!

03:21.752 --> 03:23.588
Ahh!

03:25.590 --> 03:27.158
Don't miss me too much.

03:29.260 --> 03:31.096
(door opens)

03:36.433 --> 03:38.969
COOK: Yo, three's up!

03:38.971 --> 03:40.470
WAITRESS: There you go.

03:40.472 --> 03:42.338
- METZIE: Hey, Nicki.
- Hey!

03:42.340 --> 03:44.975
Hey! So, did you open
the envelope?

03:44.977 --> 03:47.344
Hmm, we decided that we're
gonna be surprised.

03:47.346 --> 03:48.644
Well, you know,
in the old days,

03:48.646 --> 03:50.047
you didn't have a choice,
you had to wait.

03:50.049 --> 03:52.850
- It was a very long time ago, but...
- (giggles)

03:52.852 --> 03:55.052
- What?
- I can't make it to the baby shower.

03:55.054 --> 03:57.754
So I thought I would
bring this to you.

03:57.756 --> 04:00.624
Well, thank you.
Karen, you got her coffee?

04:00.626 --> 04:02.458
- KAREN: Sure do.
- NICKI: Thank you.

04:02.460 --> 04:04.693
- Have a really good time.
- Thank you, I wish you could be there.

04:04.695 --> 04:06.863
- Me too, me too.
- KAREN: There you go, miss.

04:06.865 --> 04:10.069
Thank you, darling.
All right, kids, bye.

04:31.557 --> 04:35.724
MAN: Jeffrey, I'm sure you're
aware, there's no smoking in here.

04:35.726 --> 04:38.129
I used to have three floors
in this building.

04:39.665 --> 04:41.567
You got an ashtray?

04:50.509 --> 04:52.140
You see?

04:52.142 --> 04:53.877
I can be reasonable.

04:53.879 --> 04:54.976
MAN: Good.

04:54.978 --> 04:57.647
Well, are we or are we not
going to execute

04:57.649 --> 04:59.718
this divorce agreement today?

05:01.286 --> 05:05.355
Can I... can I please just
have a moment with my wife?

05:05.357 --> 05:07.824
Seriously?

05:07.826 --> 05:08.992
(sighs)

05:08.994 --> 05:11.194
So this is what you
brought us in here for,

05:11.196 --> 05:13.396
eight o'clock this morning,
go through this again?

05:13.398 --> 05:15.699
Come on, Lloyd.

05:15.701 --> 05:17.867
We're talking
about 17 years.

05:17.869 --> 05:19.638
What's one more day?

05:20.939 --> 05:23.473
(sighs)

05:23.475 --> 05:25.140
Give us a moment.
It's okay.

05:25.142 --> 05:27.345
LLOYD: All right,
it's your call.

05:30.014 --> 05:32.781
Mr. Cage, I highly
advise you to, please,

05:32.783 --> 05:35.485
not blindside us with
something we can't fix later.

05:35.487 --> 05:37.620
MAN: Come on,
you heard the man.

05:37.622 --> 05:38.954
LLOYD: Give them the time.

05:38.956 --> 05:41.060
- We'll be outside.
- Thank you.

05:45.730 --> 05:47.831
- EVE: Really, Jeffrey?
- (door closes)

05:47.833 --> 05:50.132
You're gonna do this
in the ninth hour?

05:50.134 --> 05:51.968
It's the eleventh.

05:51.970 --> 05:53.469
What?

05:53.471 --> 05:56.740
You're supposed to say the
eleventh hour, not the ninth.

05:56.742 --> 05:59.341
Are you kidding me?

05:59.343 --> 06:00.877
Is this some big joke
to you?

06:00.879 --> 06:03.512
Come on, you used to
love my sense of humor.

06:03.514 --> 06:05.514
Yeah, you used
to be funny.

06:05.516 --> 06:08.050
Don't... don't make me do

06:08.052 --> 06:10.553
the weekend dad thing,
please, Eve.

06:10.555 --> 06:14.022
My God, Jeffrey, you hardly
spend time with J.J. as it is.

06:14.024 --> 06:16.892
You were away for business
when he was born.

06:16.894 --> 06:19.529
You were in Toronto
when he took his first steps,

06:19.531 --> 06:21.498
in Hong Kong when he said
his first words,

06:21.500 --> 06:23.598
in San Francisco
for his first day of school.

06:23.600 --> 06:25.101
Shall I continue?

06:25.103 --> 06:26.002
Rather you didn't.

06:26.004 --> 06:27.637
All right, so then sign
the damn papers

06:27.639 --> 06:29.708
and let's get on
with this.

06:31.875 --> 06:35.111
Why do you think
I work all the time?

06:35.113 --> 06:37.680
I do it for him,
I do it for us.

06:37.682 --> 06:40.185
Jeffrey, there is
no more "us."

06:43.221 --> 06:45.858
Then why are you still
wearing your ring?

06:48.526 --> 06:50.162
Bad habit.

06:56.535 --> 06:58.800
MAN (on radio):
<i>Hey, Eddie, you there?</i>

06:58.802 --> 07:01.003
<i>Copy. It's Stu. Pick up.</i>

07:01.005 --> 07:05.074
(falsetto) No, man,
this is Eddie's sister, Edwina.

07:05.076 --> 07:06.442
How are you?

07:06.444 --> 07:10.447
<i>Sammy up on the 35th is having
trouble with his lock again.</i>

07:10.449 --> 07:12.748
<i>Can you see what's going on?
Copy?</i>

07:12.750 --> 07:14.151
He's having trouble
with the lock,

07:14.153 --> 07:16.319
or did he forget
his damn keys again?

07:16.321 --> 07:19.087
<i>Man, don't bust my balls.
Bring your tools just in case.</i>

07:19.089 --> 07:22.091
<i>Oh, and the toilet on 43rd
is having issues.</i>

07:22.093 --> 07:23.493
Come on, buddy,
are you kidding me?

07:23.495 --> 07:25.027
I just unclogged
that yesterday.

07:25.029 --> 07:28.331
<i>Well, you're gonna have
to unclog it again. Copy?</i>

07:28.333 --> 07:29.798
Yeah, funny.

07:29.800 --> 07:31.901
You know, I promise you, I'm gonna
take a picture of whatever I find,

07:31.903 --> 07:33.803
I'm gonna send it to your ass.

07:33.805 --> 07:35.605
<i>Get back to me when your shit
don't stink, amigo.</i>

07:35.607 --> 07:38.139
Yeah, right, when my shit don't
stink, when my shit don't stink.

07:38.141 --> 07:40.877
One cup of coffee.
One cup of coffee.

07:40.879 --> 07:45.615
(speaking Spanish)

07:45.617 --> 07:46.683
WOMAN (on TV):
<i>Now we have a camera.</i>

07:46.685 --> 07:48.317
<i>Katie back now,
thank you so much.</i>

07:48.319 --> 07:49.920
<i>Good morning, everybody.</i>

07:49.922 --> 07:52.322
<i>For the second time
in two weeks, the U.S. has lost</i>

07:52.324 --> 07:53.690
<i>an unmanned supply plane
over Iraq.</i>

07:53.692 --> 07:55.324
Whoo! Well...

07:55.326 --> 07:58.627
You know how sometimes you just
don't want to get out of bed?

07:58.629 --> 08:00.663
- MAN: Yep.
- That was me today.

08:00.665 --> 08:02.098
- Whoo! Sorry.
- MAN: You're late.

08:02.100 --> 08:04.300
I know I'm late.
Everything okay?

08:04.302 --> 08:06.670
- MAN: Yep.
- I don't have to think about anything?

08:06.672 --> 08:08.603
- MAN: No.
- All right.

08:08.605 --> 08:09.805
(sighs)

08:09.807 --> 08:12.175
(mutters):
Good, good, good.

08:12.177 --> 08:13.812
Nice.

08:18.750 --> 08:21.050
METZIE:
Alright.

08:21.052 --> 08:22.418
I see you.

08:22.420 --> 08:23.652
What are your guys now?

08:23.654 --> 08:26.889
Oh, I think my Mets
are 71 and 73.

08:26.891 --> 08:28.558
We're almost playing
.500 baseball.

08:28.560 --> 08:32.996
Hmm. My Yanks are
85 and 57.

08:32.998 --> 08:34.964
When you gonna come over
to the pinstripes?

08:34.966 --> 08:36.932
When you pay me
my hundred dollars, honey.

08:36.933 --> 08:38.900
Ooh, okay, that'll be
tomorrow.

08:38.903 --> 08:41.436
- Uh-huh.
- Right after I hit the trifecta in the sixth.

08:41.438 --> 08:42.839
METZIE: Okay, Scarlett.

08:42.841 --> 08:44.340
Actually, you sounded
more like Annie.

08:44.342 --> 08:48.143
<i>♪ Tomorrow, tomorrow,
I'll pay you tomorrow ♪</i>

08:48.145 --> 08:50.513
- EDDIE: I've heard of her.
- METZIE: Mm-hmm.

08:50.515 --> 08:52.180
(Metzie scoffs)

08:52.182 --> 08:53.918
Mm.

08:55.253 --> 08:57.752
Ha ha ha! Look.
It's Captain Crapper.

08:57.754 --> 08:59.522
(chuckles)

08:59.524 --> 09:00.989
Heh heh heh!

09:00.991 --> 09:03.660
You're lucky I'm a little out of
shape, don't kick your ass, Charlie.

09:03.662 --> 09:05.228
A little?

09:05.230 --> 09:07.930
- Your body ain't seen a push-up in 20 years.
- Try 25, Frankie.

09:07.932 --> 09:10.632
Oh, my mistake.

09:10.634 --> 09:12.234
Hey, we still on
for Thursday?

09:12.236 --> 09:13.669
You gotta ask?

09:13.671 --> 09:15.204
Have I ever missed
poker night?

09:15.206 --> 09:17.107
Poker? What about
pizza night?

09:17.109 --> 09:20.410
I'm at pizza night, you know that.
Are you kidding me?

09:20.412 --> 09:22.478
You know I'll show up
to that anytime.

09:22.480 --> 09:23.813
(chuckles)

09:23.815 --> 09:25.113
- Frankie.
- Yeah.

09:25.115 --> 09:26.916
You wanna hold this
for a second?

09:26.918 --> 09:29.321
I gotta tie my shoe. Matter
of fact, I gotta go.

09:34.258 --> 09:36.592
<i>We hung out together on Sunday
night at a fashion show,</i>

09:36.594 --> 09:39.462
<i>and she'll be joining us
this morning to tell us about</i>

09:39.464 --> 09:43.132
<i>a personal style show that she
is hosting and producing.</i>

09:43.134 --> 09:46.768
<i>It is called "Tracey Ullman's

09:46.770 --> 09:50.605
<i>♪ Bah-da-bah-da-bah... ♪</i>

09:50.607 --> 09:54.044
LAUER: <i>Katie, we're also going to have
more of our week-long special series</i>

09:54.046 --> 09:56.680
<i>on living longer, living better
after the age of 50.</i>

09:56.682 --> 09:58.881
<i>This morning we'll focus

09:58.883 --> 10:00.619
(elevator bell dings)

10:02.754 --> 10:04.590
Excuse me.

10:05.856 --> 10:08.961
- Sorry, sir.
- You're fine.

10:11.663 --> 10:13.932
Oh, shit, this one's going up.

10:16.668 --> 10:18.032
(door closes)

10:18.034 --> 10:20.301
You really don't have to
walk me to my car.

10:20.303 --> 10:22.839
I am perfectly capable
of getting there myself.

10:22.841 --> 10:25.675
It's something
a good husband does.

10:25.677 --> 10:28.444
Oh, and that's supposed to
be you all of a sudden?

10:28.446 --> 10:30.014
(cell phone rings)

10:31.082 --> 10:32.016
Hey.

10:33.051 --> 10:35.919
Uh... um...
okay, what time...

10:35.921 --> 10:37.923
what time is your mom
coming through?

10:39.725 --> 10:41.590
Uh, I'll be there
like 15 minutes,

10:41.592 --> 10:45.363
something like 15 minutes after she
gets there, yeah, I'll be there.

10:47.865 --> 10:50.132
Hello? Hello?

10:50.134 --> 10:51.734
Hello, hello, hello?

10:51.736 --> 10:52.937
- Damn.
- (elevator bell dings)

10:58.942 --> 11:01.344
(phone beeping)

11:01.346 --> 11:02.980
(door closes)

11:07.851 --> 11:09.618
(elevator bell dings)

11:09.620 --> 11:11.653
(door opens)

11:11.655 --> 11:15.757
Not a cloud in the sky.
Have a good day, everyone.

11:15.759 --> 11:18.395
WOMAN: Wait.
Is this one going down?

11:18.397 --> 11:19.628
At some point.

11:19.630 --> 11:21.597
I'll take
the next one.

11:21.599 --> 11:23.235
Perfect.

11:53.498 --> 11:56.568
(explosion)

11:59.236 --> 12:00.538
Shit!

12:02.206 --> 12:05.141
What the fuck was that?

12:05.143 --> 12:07.144
(muffled rumbling)

12:10.914 --> 12:14.249
What the hell was that?

12:16.553 --> 12:18.756
Oh, man.

12:20.191 --> 12:23.926
Where are my elevators?

12:23.928 --> 12:25.629
What the hell?

12:29.167 --> 12:31.132
Jeffrey, what's going on?

12:31.134 --> 12:32.734
I don't have a clue.

12:32.736 --> 12:34.837
Maybe one of
the cables snapped.

12:34.839 --> 12:38.306
No, no, no, I heard something.
Sounded like an explosion.

12:38.308 --> 12:41.111
Let me try
the intercom.

12:41.113 --> 12:43.382
Metzie? Hello?

12:45.015 --> 12:47.382
Metzie, come on,
girlfriend, hello?

12:47.384 --> 12:50.121
(distant rumbling, clanging)

12:53.758 --> 12:55.992
- (indistinct conversation)
- MAN: Something's going on.

12:55.994 --> 12:59.195
MAN: ...check the circuit
breakers right now.

12:59.197 --> 13:01.464
WOMAN: Is there an outage?

13:01.466 --> 13:03.465
MAN: It's crazy.

13:03.467 --> 13:06.070
METZIE: Is anybody there?
Can anybody hear me?

13:07.804 --> 13:09.440
Damn.

13:12.244 --> 13:13.644
What's going on?

13:15.947 --> 13:18.480
- Metzie, you feel that?
- Yeah, what was it?

13:18.482 --> 13:20.782
They say a small-engine plane
hit the building.

13:20.784 --> 13:23.585
- Come on.
- The fire department's trying to figure it out.

13:23.587 --> 13:27.422
Look, half my elevators
are not working.

13:27.424 --> 13:29.324
Nothing on the console
is working at all.

13:29.326 --> 13:31.026
- Try rebooting the communication link.
- METZIE: I did that.

13:31.028 --> 13:33.362
- Well, try it again.
- Well, how many times should I do it?

13:33.364 --> 13:34.530
- I'm telling you, look at the board!
- Again.

13:34.532 --> 13:36.567
- They'll come up.
- Look at the board!

13:38.870 --> 13:40.036
(hangs up phone)

13:40.038 --> 13:42.204
METZIE: Where are you going?

13:42.206 --> 13:44.375
I'm gonna go see
what's going on.

13:47.110 --> 13:49.712
Son of a...

13:49.714 --> 13:51.216
(sighs)

13:56.453 --> 13:59.022
Metzie! Metzie,
come on, baby girl!

13:59.024 --> 14:00.223
Who is Metzie?

14:00.225 --> 14:01.456
Metzie's
the elevator dispatcher.

14:01.458 --> 14:03.191
She's usually
"Johnny on the Spot"

14:03.193 --> 14:04.893
when it comes to her elevators.
Metzie!

14:04.895 --> 14:08.098
- All the circuits are busy.
- MICHAEL: I can't get no reception either.

14:08.100 --> 14:11.901
Intercom is down. All the
cell towers are jammed.

14:11.903 --> 14:13.301
Well, what do you think?

14:13.303 --> 14:16.605
But why do so many people need
to make calls at the same time?

14:16.607 --> 14:19.376
If it is a broken cable,
can we fall?

14:21.946 --> 14:25.214
That only
happened once, in 1945.

14:25.216 --> 14:28.282
The Empire State Building
got hit by a B-25 bomber

14:28.284 --> 14:30.453
and the elevator fell
roughly 80 stories.

14:30.455 --> 14:32.488
But...
the lady survived.

14:32.490 --> 14:36.224
Survived? Eighty-story fall?
That's bullshit.

14:36.226 --> 14:38.194
Were you a witness?

14:38.196 --> 14:39.695
In '45?

14:39.697 --> 14:42.064
Sure, I look great for
my age, don't you think?

14:42.066 --> 14:44.599
Um, (clears throat),
how did she make it?

14:44.601 --> 14:47.869
Apparently she laid
on the floor, on her back,

14:47.871 --> 14:49.539
and didn't break
a single bone.

14:49.541 --> 14:52.574
It was a miracle.
<i>Un milagro.</i>

14:52.576 --> 14:53.975
Well, perhaps.

14:53.977 --> 14:56.679
I think of it more
as random.

14:56.681 --> 14:59.348
Besides, all these
modern elevators have brakes

14:59.350 --> 15:01.416
in case something
like that happens.

15:01.418 --> 15:04.185
- How do we know this one...
- Because they all do.

15:04.187 --> 15:05.688
He reads a lot.

15:05.690 --> 15:07.190
EDDIE: How much?

15:07.192 --> 15:10.026
Six newspapers a day,
even on Sundays.

15:10.028 --> 15:11.396
The crosswords.

15:13.063 --> 15:15.296
I gather you guys
know each other?

15:15.298 --> 15:17.666
Well, I've got a piece
of paper at home

15:17.668 --> 15:19.435
- that says we're married.
- Oh, really?

15:19.437 --> 15:20.770
- She's got one in her purse...
- You're gonna do this...

15:20.772 --> 15:22.704
See, this is exactly what
the shrink talks about...

15:22.706 --> 15:24.205
- trying to say that we're not.
- when you're oversharing with strangers.

15:24.207 --> 15:25.741
Don't have to do that.

15:25.743 --> 15:27.612
That's so sad.

15:29.114 --> 15:31.513
You two seem like
a good match.

15:31.515 --> 15:32.950
- We are.
- EVE: We're not.

15:38.923 --> 15:40.989
So, uh, Eddie...

15:40.991 --> 15:43.493
You look like someone who knows
his way around this building.

15:43.495 --> 15:46.094
- EDDIE: Yeah, a bit.
- How long you been working here?

15:46.096 --> 15:49.531
I've been working here 20 years.
I'm a custodial engineer.

15:49.533 --> 15:52.834
- Hmm. A janitor?
- Excuse me.

15:52.836 --> 15:56.439
My official title: custodial
engineer, okay, buddy?

15:56.441 --> 15:58.541
Okay, okay, so how much
do you actually know

15:58.543 --> 16:00.007
about the elevators
in this building?

16:00.009 --> 16:05.515
I know they go up and I know
they go down, that's about it.

16:05.517 --> 16:08.718
All right, anybody want to give me
a hand, try to pry the doors open?

16:08.720 --> 16:11.288
I'll help you out,
but I don't know why.

16:13.157 --> 16:14.723
(straining)

16:14.725 --> 16:15.690
Careful.

16:15.692 --> 16:18.596
Yeah, it feels like
it's stuck on something.

16:20.565 --> 16:24.166
EDDIE: It's probably one of the
ones that have a lock on it.

16:24.168 --> 16:26.134
What? What?
What does that mean?

16:26.136 --> 16:30.672
Some of the elevators, they have locks
that prevent the doors from opening.

16:30.674 --> 16:35.210
A lock engages when the elevator's
disabled or in between landings.

16:35.212 --> 16:37.345
Why do they want us
to be stuck in here?

16:37.347 --> 16:39.581
EDDIE: It's an insurance issue.

16:39.583 --> 16:41.950
Part of the training you get
when you work here.

16:41.952 --> 16:45.587
We're not supposed to encourage
people to climb out of these things.

16:45.589 --> 16:47.623
The protocol is,
you wait for help.

16:47.625 --> 16:49.391
That's the insurance part.

16:49.393 --> 16:51.526
That way nobody's gonna
fall down the shaft.

16:51.528 --> 16:54.128
EVE: Wait, so... so...
so we can't unlock it,

16:54.130 --> 16:55.730
we're stuck in here?

16:55.732 --> 16:58.199
Yeah, I mean, I don't think
so, I mean, I don't know.

16:58.201 --> 17:01.670
I don't see how we could open
this from the inside anyway.

17:01.672 --> 17:04.406
I mean, that's
the whole idea, right?

17:04.409 --> 17:07.375
TINA: Hey, everyone...
(gasping)

17:07.377 --> 17:09.178
I'm freaking out.

17:09.180 --> 17:11.413
I don't do well
in small places.

17:11.415 --> 17:14.215
- JEFFREY: None of us do.
- Look at me, just breathe.

17:14.218 --> 17:16.184
You've gotta breathe.
Look at me, calm down.

17:16.185 --> 17:17.385
Calm down.
Whatever you do...

17:17.387 --> 17:19.188
What do you say, Eddie,
should we give it a shot?

17:19.190 --> 17:20.122
- Ready?
- Yeah.

17:20.124 --> 17:21.522
MICHAEL:
Wait, wait, wait.

17:21.525 --> 17:25.795
You just said, the reason why
this thing is locked, so...

17:25.797 --> 17:27.462
can we just, like,
wait for the people

17:27.464 --> 17:29.297
to come and get us
out of here?

17:29.299 --> 17:32.870
I mean, I know it's terrible, but we've
only been in here for like a few minutes.

17:34.805 --> 17:36.471
Let me see if
I've got this straight.

17:36.473 --> 17:39.674
The dude that rides a bicycle
all over Manhattan

17:39.676 --> 17:41.911
is the dude that's
now making safety an issue?

17:41.913 --> 17:43.911
Whatever, dude. I'm the dude with
a reason for what I'm saying.

17:43.913 --> 17:45.547
Guys, could we please
not do the "dude" thing?

17:45.549 --> 17:47.949
Listen, we've
gotta stay calm, okay?

17:47.951 --> 17:51.152
Someone will come. I think...
I'm sorry, what is your name?

17:51.154 --> 17:52.621
Michael.

17:52.623 --> 17:54.623
- Michael, hi, I'm Eve.
- MICHAEL: Hello.

17:54.625 --> 17:57.226
This is Jeffrey.
You are...?

17:57.228 --> 17:58.526
- Tina.
- Okay.

17:58.528 --> 17:59.894
You know
I'm Eddie.

17:59.896 --> 18:01.998
Yes. We just have to keep
calm, you guys.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.734
Look, guys, I think we're just
gonna have to wait this out.

18:05.736 --> 18:08.069
That's what we'll have to do.

18:08.071 --> 18:10.271
Because of insurance?

18:10.273 --> 18:11.873
- Yeah, yeah.
- Thank you.

18:11.875 --> 18:13.409
- Exac...
- Thanks.

18:13.411 --> 18:14.642
Okay, okay.

18:14.644 --> 18:18.346
So, what floor are we on,
exactly?

18:18.348 --> 18:20.382
Uh, let's see.

18:20.384 --> 18:24.085
I got on the 35th floor,
went up a little bit.

18:24.087 --> 18:28.423
I wanna say we're somewhere
between the 38th, 37th floor.

18:28.425 --> 18:30.292
That's it.

18:30.294 --> 18:32.897
(Tina sighs)

18:37.535 --> 18:40.536
Anybody want one?
Helps you relax.

18:40.538 --> 18:43.107
No, I'm good.

18:44.942 --> 18:47.075
<i>As Matt just mentioned,
we have a breaking news story</i>

18:47.077 --> 18:47.943
<i>to tell you about.</i>

18:47.945 --> 18:50.046
<i>Apparently a plane
has just crashed</i>

18:50.048 --> 18:53.315
<i>into the World Trade Center
here in New York City.</i>

18:53.317 --> 18:54.786
Nora, come here.

18:56.153 --> 18:58.988
I need you to take all of this,
take it right into there.

18:58.990 --> 19:02.056
MAN: We need a supervisor here.
Is there a supervisor?

19:02.058 --> 19:04.759
METZIE: Guys, we've got
32 elevators off the grid.

19:04.761 --> 19:08.698
All the upper floors are gone.
No security cameras anywhere.

19:08.700 --> 19:13.067
I did manage to find two folks
in shaft 6 on floors 8 and 13.

19:13.069 --> 19:16.838
All right, we've got an inferno on
the North Tower on 90 and above.

19:16.840 --> 19:18.907
Can any of my guys
take the elevators?

19:18.909 --> 19:22.478
You cannot take the elevators.
They are down. Nothing is working.

19:22.480 --> 19:24.380
- Ninety floors of stairs?
- METZIE: Ninety floors.

19:24.382 --> 19:27.748
- There's gotta be a better way.
- I'm sorry, guys, I don't have it for you.

19:27.750 --> 19:29.751
- You just gotta do what you can do.
- Alright, we'll make do.

19:29.753 --> 19:32.286
Tell the captain we're going
90, we're taking the stairs.

19:32.288 --> 19:34.025
Go, fellas!
We're taking the stairs!

19:40.531 --> 19:43.298
WOMAN (on TV): <i>...behind me,
and it is unbelievable.</i>

19:43.300 --> 19:45.133
<i>When the fire first...</i>

19:45.135 --> 19:48.105
(muffled rumbling, clanging)

19:56.846 --> 19:58.646
- (lights sparking)
- (Tina screams)

19:58.648 --> 20:00.982
- MICHAEL: Fuck!
- EDDIE: What the fuck?

20:00.984 --> 20:05.353
MICHAEL: Hey! You gotta tell us
what's going on in here, Eddie.

20:05.355 --> 20:07.355
- EDDIE: I'm trying.
- MICHAEL: Yo.

20:07.357 --> 20:09.225
MICHAEL: What is going on
in here, man?

20:09.227 --> 20:13.194
- Jeffrey, what's going on?
- JEFFREY: We're okay. We're okay.

20:13.196 --> 20:15.232
EVE: Do you hear that?

20:17.367 --> 20:18.569
Shit.

20:19.369 --> 20:20.602
That was very interesting.

20:20.604 --> 20:22.904
I think I'll take you up
on taking one of those.

20:22.906 --> 20:24.206
I don't think
I need to remind you

20:24.208 --> 20:26.775
about the last few times
you took prescription meds.

20:26.777 --> 20:29.744
- What happened?
- I'm allergic to them.

20:29.746 --> 20:32.480
I break out in airbags, okay?

20:32.482 --> 20:34.685
- EVE: Totally different situation.
- Okay.

20:35.618 --> 20:38.319
Were you here
in '93?

20:38.321 --> 20:40.355
My friend Paulie
got hurt pretty bad.

20:40.357 --> 20:46.728
Man, I started riding in '93.
That was... just crazy.

20:46.730 --> 20:48.563
JEFFREY: Intercom's dead.
Phone lines are down.

20:48.565 --> 20:51.968
The noises,
the shockwave.

20:51.970 --> 20:53.535
I thought about that.

20:53.537 --> 20:54.736
- Really?
- EVE: What?

20:54.738 --> 20:57.005
I didn't wanna say
anything about it.

20:57.007 --> 20:59.975
TINA: Wait,
what happened in '93?

20:59.977 --> 21:04.479
A group of Jihadists drove a van into
the basement of the North Tower,

21:04.481 --> 21:07.015
about a thousand pounds
of explosives on board.

21:07.017 --> 21:11.319
Yeah, six people died,
hundreds got hurt.

21:11.321 --> 21:13.921
My friend Paulie
lost his leg.

21:13.923 --> 21:16.726
The bad guys thought
if they detonated the bomb

21:16.728 --> 21:20.094
that the North Tower would
topple into the South,

21:20.096 --> 21:22.133
bringing them both down.

21:24.868 --> 21:27.303
Look, I understand how
we're all feeling.

21:27.305 --> 21:28.837
I understand the protocol.

21:28.839 --> 21:31.206
But my gut
is telling me...

21:31.208 --> 21:33.942
We have to get out of here.
We have to get out of here now.

21:33.944 --> 21:35.178
Fuck this shit.

21:37.749 --> 21:40.548
Wanna give me a hand, please?
Try that shit one more time.

21:40.550 --> 21:42.617
Come on, one, two...

21:42.619 --> 21:44.385
- Come on. Come on, come on!
- JEFFREY: Christ.

21:44.387 --> 21:46.055
- EDDIE: Two, three!
- EVE: Pull!

21:46.057 --> 21:47.689
- (Eddie and Jeffrey straining)
- EVE: Harder.

21:47.691 --> 21:50.060
Oh, it's not working.

21:51.862 --> 21:53.230
Fuck!

21:55.732 --> 21:59.468
METZIE: <i>Please, can...
anybody... hear me? Hello?</i>

21:59.470 --> 22:02.571
Metzie, it's Eddie!

22:02.573 --> 22:05.474
- <i>It's Eddie!</i>
- Eddie! Where the hell are you?

22:05.476 --> 22:08.075
Man, I am so happy to hear
your voice right now, listen.

22:08.077 --> 22:11.680
Metzie, we're on the 38th,
37th floor somewhere,

22:11.682 --> 22:13.149
in the North Tower.

22:13.151 --> 22:15.851
What the fuck is going on
out there?!

22:15.853 --> 22:18.286
Baby, you're not gonna
believe this.

22:18.288 --> 22:20.588
Some fool hit the tower

22:20.590 --> 22:22.757
<i>with like a little
propeller plane or something.</i>

22:22.759 --> 22:24.692
Get the fuck out,
are you kidding me?

22:24.694 --> 22:26.161
METZIE: <i>No, I'm telling
you the truth.</i>

22:26.163 --> 22:29.030
Somebody hit the damn thing
with a little plane!

22:29.032 --> 22:30.732
EDDIE: No shit.

22:30.734 --> 22:32.468
Is there a lot of damage?

22:32.470 --> 22:34.001
I don't know, baby,
I don't know.

22:34.003 --> 22:35.738
It's some sort of...
I don't know.

22:35.740 --> 22:37.372
It hit the 90th floor.

22:37.374 --> 22:39.708
<i>All the elevators seem
to be down.</i>

22:39.710 --> 22:43.144
I'm watching a live feed
outside the building,

22:43.146 --> 22:45.279
<i>and I can tell you,
it doesn't look good.</i>

22:45.281 --> 22:48.517
Listen, there's five of us
in here, including me.

22:48.519 --> 22:50.286
We're all good right now.

22:50.288 --> 22:51.653
Well, do you have any water?

22:51.655 --> 22:53.588
<i>You have stuff to drink?</i>

22:53.590 --> 22:55.824
- EDDIE: Uh...
- EVE: I got this.

22:55.826 --> 22:58.160
EDDIE:
Yeah, we got some water.

22:58.162 --> 22:59.327
And a granola bar.

22:59.329 --> 23:00.996
<i>I'm just saying,
you know,</i>

23:00.998 --> 23:03.367
it might take a little while
to get to you.

23:04.634 --> 23:07.068
- Excuse me, let me talk to her.
- EDDIE: Yeah, go.

23:07.070 --> 23:09.571
Metzie? Yeah, hi,
this is Jeffrey Cage.

23:09.573 --> 23:11.338
Oh, Jeff...

23:11.340 --> 23:13.042
<i>Jeffrey Cage, sir.
How are you?</i>

23:13.044 --> 23:16.944
Well, I'd be a lot better if we had a sense
of timing on when to expect some help.

23:16.946 --> 23:21.917
I think the first order of business is
going to be getting the flames contained.

23:21.919 --> 23:24.518
I think once they do that,
they can do everything else,

23:24.520 --> 23:28.891
but they have to go up to
ninety-something to put the flames out,

23:28.893 --> 23:31.162
so, sir, you're just gonna
have to sit tight.

23:32.430 --> 23:35.162
- What?
- JEFFREY: So are you saying

23:35.164 --> 23:37.533
that not one single elevator
is operational at this point?

23:37.535 --> 23:42.971
No, sir, what I'm saying is not one
single elevator is operational <i>yet.</i>

23:42.973 --> 23:45.775
<i>That's what I'm saying. Yet.</i>

23:45.777 --> 23:47.476
TINA: I don't understand.
What does that mean?

23:47.478 --> 23:50.446
EDDIE: Metzie, we're gonna
hang here tight, all right?

23:50.448 --> 23:53.882
Just do me a favor, please,
just get somebody up here

23:53.884 --> 23:55.817
as soon as you can, okay?

23:55.819 --> 23:58.487
METZIE: <i>I will, baby.
And, Eddie?</i>

23:58.489 --> 23:59.854
Yeah?

23:59.856 --> 24:01.757
<i>Don't forget
you owe me money, okay?</i>

24:01.759 --> 24:03.424
(chuckles)

24:03.426 --> 24:05.160
Yeah, okay.

24:05.162 --> 24:06.728
All right.

24:06.730 --> 24:08.830
So, guys, this is great.

24:08.832 --> 24:10.466
Right? I mean,
we're getting out of here.

24:10.468 --> 24:13.067
- She's sending help. It's great.
- JEFFREY: Yeah.

24:13.069 --> 24:16.136
Yeah, but didn't she say they
need to contain the fires first?

24:16.138 --> 24:19.173
Man, it's gonna take
the firefighters all day

24:19.175 --> 24:21.442
to go up and down
the stairs, all day.

24:21.444 --> 24:23.944
And we're talking about
what, a minute a floor?

24:23.946 --> 24:25.713
We're looking at an hour
and a half, maybe two,

24:25.715 --> 24:28.083
just for them to make it
to the flames.

24:28.085 --> 24:30.052
EDDIE: You know,
I'm not worried about it.

24:30.054 --> 24:31.786
We've got billionaire
Jeffrey Cage in the elevator.

24:31.788 --> 24:34.422
They're gonna be sprinting up
the stairs just to get him out.

24:34.424 --> 24:36.758
You mean get <i>us</i> out.

24:36.760 --> 24:38.594
Well, I'm...
I'm just saying, you know,

24:38.596 --> 24:40.996
membership in your club
has its privileges.

24:40.998 --> 24:43.097
Whatever it takes,
right?

24:43.099 --> 24:44.498
Right.

24:44.500 --> 24:45.566
- Yeah, man.
- JEFFREY: Right.

24:45.568 --> 24:48.236
You know, I remember
seeing you around.

24:48.238 --> 24:51.605
You probably don't remember
me, but I remember you.

24:51.607 --> 24:53.208
The King of
Wall Street, man.

24:53.210 --> 24:55.043
You were the shit,
Mr. Cage. Yeah, man.

24:55.045 --> 24:58.380
- Thank you.
- Making money hand over first.

24:58.382 --> 25:00.048
Come on.
(chuckles)

25:00.050 --> 25:02.883
Yeah, man,
pretty cool.

25:02.885 --> 25:04.620
I'm sorry we had
to meet this way.

25:04.622 --> 25:07.323
- JEFFREY: Me too.
- I'm just gonna chill out over here if you need anything.

25:07.325 --> 25:10.027
Okay. Thank you.

25:19.036 --> 25:22.304
How in the hell
does that happen?

25:22.306 --> 25:24.905
How do you
accidentally crash a plane

25:24.907 --> 25:27.177
into one of the largest
buildings in New York City?

25:31.182 --> 25:32.817
Excuse me.

25:35.285 --> 25:37.352
Jeffrey.

25:37.354 --> 25:39.688
Can we just do this?

25:39.690 --> 25:42.423
I need you to sign this.
I just do.

25:42.425 --> 25:43.757
(scoffs)

25:43.759 --> 25:45.693
Really?

25:45.695 --> 25:48.029
In here?
Right now?

25:48.031 --> 25:50.532
Why not?
We're not going anywhere.

25:50.534 --> 25:52.132
You can't run away.

25:52.134 --> 25:53.736
What difference
does it make?

25:53.738 --> 25:55.170
All these people know
our business, anyway.

25:55.172 --> 25:57.206
You mean just like
all your friends do?

25:57.208 --> 25:58.840
I mean, Christ,
even Nancy knew

25:58.842 --> 26:00.374
you were filing
before I did.

26:00.376 --> 26:02.776
TINA: A woman is gonna
talk to her friends first

26:02.778 --> 26:05.080
before she makes
any big life decisions.

26:05.082 --> 26:09.084
- Excuse me?
- Sorry.

26:09.086 --> 26:11.553
Come on. The writing was
on the wall for years.

26:11.555 --> 26:13.755
You just never slowed down
long enough to read it.

26:13.757 --> 26:17.225
Okay, okay, all right, fine.
Okay, okay, so...

26:17.227 --> 26:20.264
Tell me,
what's it say?

26:22.098 --> 26:27.068
Okay, it says, I'm tired
of fighting with you.

26:27.070 --> 26:29.136
I'm tired of feeling
lonely all the time.

26:29.138 --> 26:32.841
I'm tired of looking into
our son's sad little face

26:32.843 --> 26:35.911
full of disappointment because
his father is not there again,

26:35.913 --> 26:37.711
and I have to explain
to him why not,

26:37.713 --> 26:40.114
why isn't he sharing his life
with him, why isn't he here.

26:40.116 --> 26:41.815
I can't do it.
I really can't do it.

26:41.817 --> 26:43.518
You've got to do this
for us, please.

26:43.520 --> 26:45.487
I-I promise you,

26:45.489 --> 26:47.788
all of that is
going to change.

26:47.790 --> 26:50.092
Yeah.
I've heard this before.

26:50.094 --> 26:52.861
And I believed it
the first hundred times.

26:52.863 --> 26:54.395
I'm sorry, I just...

26:54.397 --> 26:57.000
I don't have any belief
left in me anymore.

26:59.769 --> 27:02.103
You guys, you guys
are so lucky.

27:02.105 --> 27:04.373
You get to fight
in one language.

27:04.375 --> 27:08.576
At home, my wifey,
she comes at me in Spanish

27:08.578 --> 27:09.777
and in English.

27:09.779 --> 27:11.279
Let me tell you something,

27:11.281 --> 27:13.515
don't ever get a Puerto Rican
girl mad at you.

27:13.517 --> 27:16.751
Nah. She starts with
all that Spanglish stuff,

27:16.753 --> 27:18.920
untranslatable, trust me, okay?

27:18.922 --> 27:20.622
I'm not kidding on that.

27:20.624 --> 27:22.056
What do you fight about?

27:22.058 --> 27:25.492
Oh, what <i>don't</i> we fight about?

27:25.494 --> 27:28.162
Kids, money, work.

27:28.164 --> 27:30.832
My girlfriend
from the ninth grade.

27:30.834 --> 27:33.634
I mean, don't get me wrong,
I'm not saying I don't love her.

27:33.636 --> 27:36.738
I mean, shit, I've been with her
for, what, 23 years...

27:36.740 --> 27:38.539
Yeah, 23 years.

27:38.541 --> 27:43.244
I mean, that alone reserves her
a space in heaven.

27:43.246 --> 27:47.148
You know, these are
my kids right here.

27:47.150 --> 27:49.817
Everybody,
that's Christian.

27:49.819 --> 27:52.554
MJ, my little princess
right there.

27:52.556 --> 27:53.921
She's nine.

27:53.923 --> 27:57.193
Ooh, what I wouldn't
do for them.

27:58.929 --> 28:00.598
Mr. Cage,
you got any kids?

28:03.666 --> 28:05.034
J.J.

28:05.036 --> 28:07.404
He's eight.

28:08.605 --> 28:12.240
What about you, mister man?
You got any kids?

28:12.242 --> 28:13.741
Yep.

28:13.743 --> 28:16.710
Boys? Girls?

28:16.712 --> 28:18.080
Girl.

28:18.082 --> 28:19.713
Actually, today
is her birthday

28:19.715 --> 28:22.317
and we had a party planned
out for her and everything,

28:22.319 --> 28:26.520
but as you can see, I'm stuck in a
goddamn elevator with y'all, so...

28:26.522 --> 28:27.823
What's her name?

28:27.825 --> 28:29.057
Chantelle.

28:29.059 --> 28:30.691
Oh, that's
a beautiful name.

28:30.693 --> 28:33.161
(sighs) Well... maybe
they'll get us out of here

28:33.163 --> 28:34.830
and you'll still
make it in time.

28:34.832 --> 28:36.398
Please, please,
please, just stop.

28:36.400 --> 28:39.901
I get it. I don't mean to
disrespect you, no disrespect,

28:39.903 --> 28:41.201
but it's okay.

28:41.203 --> 28:43.037
I know something
about missing birthdays,

28:43.039 --> 28:44.975
so I'm okay.

28:52.281 --> 28:53.847
WOMAN: <i>...like confetti.</i>

28:53.849 --> 28:55.616
<i>Um, the area is swarmed with</i>

28:55.618 --> 28:59.086
- <i>emergency vehicles and sirens.</i>
- COURIC: <i>Have you...</i>

28:59.088 --> 29:01.456
WOMAN: <i>Obviously, we're very sensitive
to this in this neighborhood.</i>

29:01.458 --> 29:02.891
COURIC: <i>Ellie,
have you, of course,</i>

29:02.893 --> 29:06.126
<i>because of the incident that
occurred in the early 1990s,</i>

29:06.128 --> 29:09.331
<i>have you seen any evidence,
Ellie, yet</i>

29:09.333 --> 29:11.798
<i>of people being taken out
of the building?</i>

29:11.800 --> 29:15.903
<i>You say that emergency vehicles
are there, understandably so,</i>

29:15.905 --> 29:18.573
<i>but of course a major concern
is human loss.</i>

29:18.575 --> 29:21.609
<i>I mean, do you know if there were
many people in the building?</i>

29:21.611 --> 29:25.080
ELLIE: <i>Oh, another one just hit!
Something else just hit!</i>

29:25.082 --> 29:27.915
(crashing, roaring)

29:27.917 --> 29:29.750
(screaming)

29:29.752 --> 29:31.652
What the fuck?!

29:31.654 --> 29:34.690
(rumbling continues)

29:34.692 --> 29:36.859
(Tina gasping)

29:36.861 --> 29:40.027
Metzie! Metzie,
what the hell is that?

29:40.029 --> 29:42.296
(Tina gasping)

29:42.298 --> 29:44.498
Metzie!

29:44.500 --> 29:47.235
LAUER:
<i>There it is right there.</i>

29:47.237 --> 29:49.638
ELLIE: <i>Again, I'm looking
from south to north,</i>

29:49.640 --> 29:51.806
<i>and it went into
the one on the right.</i>

29:51.808 --> 29:53.240
Eddie, stand by.

29:53.242 --> 29:55.142
LAUER: <i>That appears to be
at least a 727.</i>

29:55.144 --> 29:57.411
ELLIE: <i>It was at least a 727.
It was a jet.</i>

29:57.413 --> 29:59.981
<i>I couldn't believe my eyes,
watching it right above me.</i>

29:59.983 --> 30:02.383
LAUER: <i>And now you have
to move</i>

30:02.385 --> 30:04.552
<i>from talk about
a possible accident</i>

30:04.554 --> 30:08.190
<i>to talk about something deliberate
that has happened here.</i>

30:08.192 --> 30:11.325
<i>We're going to immediately check
with air-traffic control in the area</i>

30:11.327 --> 30:14.296
<i>to find out if they had contact
with either of these planes</i>

30:14.298 --> 30:15.764
<i>before the accident.</i>

30:15.766 --> 30:17.431
<i>But what we've just seen</i>

30:17.433 --> 30:20.336
<i>is about the most shocking
videotape I've ever seen.</i>

30:22.705 --> 30:23.904
Eddie.

30:23.906 --> 30:25.073
Yeah.

30:25.075 --> 30:27.843
<i>Listen, baby, I...</i>

30:27.845 --> 30:30.411
I need you...

30:30.413 --> 30:31.947
to try to get the hell out

30:31.949 --> 30:34.349
<i>of that elevator.</i>

30:34.351 --> 30:37.051
What happened to the help
you said was coming?

30:37.053 --> 30:39.319
I think their hands are full.

30:39.321 --> 30:41.491
EDDIE: <i>What do you mean
their hands are full?</i>

30:43.492 --> 30:45.760
Baby, I think we're
under attack.

30:45.762 --> 30:47.696
- What?
- EDDIE: Under attack?

30:47.698 --> 30:49.200
'93, guys.

30:51.401 --> 30:54.469
METZIE: <i>Listen, have you... have
you tried opening the doors?</i>

30:54.471 --> 30:55.469
Yeah.

30:55.471 --> 30:57.538
I think... I think we got...

30:57.540 --> 30:59.940
We got one of the new ones
with a lock.

30:59.942 --> 31:01.575
Oh, what about the hatch?

31:01.577 --> 31:03.778
There's a hatch on the roof. There's
an escape hatch on the roof.

31:03.780 --> 31:04.979
<i>Did you try that?</i>

31:04.981 --> 31:06.180
No hatch. I mean...

31:06.182 --> 31:07.649
There is.

31:07.651 --> 31:10.617
<i>It's there, it's behind
the roof's paneling.</i>

31:10.619 --> 31:13.854
<i>You just...
It's probably locked,</i>

31:13.856 --> 31:14.890
but if you get up there,

31:14.892 --> 31:16.324
you might be able
to get it open.

31:16.326 --> 31:20.595
All right, wait, wait, how...
How am I supposed to get, how?

31:20.597 --> 31:21.962
Listen to me.

31:21.964 --> 31:26.634
I'm telling you, you need
to get out of the elevator.

31:26.636 --> 31:28.236
<i>You understand me?</i>

31:28.238 --> 31:30.474
<i>Get out of the elevator.</i>

31:31.441 --> 31:35.576
Metzie. Metzie, when you
say "under attack,"

31:35.578 --> 31:38.148
what the hell does
that actually mean?

31:40.651 --> 31:43.151
The explosion you felt

31:43.153 --> 31:45.120
was from the South Tower,

31:45.122 --> 31:48.055
<i>was from another plane.</i>

31:48.057 --> 31:50.091
And not by accident, man.

31:50.093 --> 31:51.862
On purpose.

31:53.130 --> 31:54.528
Holy shit.

31:54.530 --> 31:56.898
- Okay, okay, um...
- Holy shit.

31:56.900 --> 31:59.234
Call Frankie
on his cell phone!

31:59.236 --> 32:01.803
I've been calling him,
I've been calling him.

32:01.805 --> 32:04.372
He was here for a few minutes
and then he went outside

32:04.374 --> 32:06.975
to see what was going on,
and I ain't seen him since,

32:06.977 --> 32:08.843
but I'm still calling him.

32:08.845 --> 32:13.081
- JEFFREY: Who is Frankie?
- Okay, Frankie, Frankie, he's the elevator supervisor.

32:13.083 --> 32:14.415
He knows his way
in and out of them.

32:14.417 --> 32:16.183
<i>He knows everything
about this shit!</i>

32:16.185 --> 32:17.951
<i>Okay, okay, Metzie,
listen, listen!</i>

32:17.953 --> 32:20.521
We're gonna... we're gonna
try and figure this out.

32:20.523 --> 32:22.155
Okay, we're gonna try
and figure this out.

32:22.157 --> 32:24.459
Just please, please,
get in touch with Frankie.

32:24.461 --> 32:27.094
<i>All right, we're gonna try
and figure this out in here.</i>

32:27.096 --> 32:29.730
- Okay, I'll get back to you.
- EVE: Watch your eyes. Keep your eyes closed.

32:29.732 --> 32:33.133
- EDDIE: There you go.
- EVE: Got it. Push it, push it.

32:33.135 --> 32:35.135
- EDDIE: Okay, all right.
- EVE: (clapping) Yes!

32:35.137 --> 32:38.073
EDDIE: Okay, all right.
Okay, right there.

32:38.075 --> 32:41.609
- I think I could get to that, guys.
- EVE: Is that the...?

32:41.611 --> 32:44.379
- Can I get a hand, please?
- MICHAEL: Yeah. Okay, okay, okay.

32:44.381 --> 32:47.815
You should take that off, bro.
Take that off, come on.

32:47.817 --> 32:49.617
- Here we go.
- EVE: Alright, we got you here. We got you here.

32:49.619 --> 32:52.520
- EDDIE: Okay, please?
- I'll go in the front, I'll go in front.

32:52.522 --> 32:54.355
- Okay, ready? Here we go.
- EVE: Yeah.

32:54.357 --> 32:55.957
- EDDIE: One... Wait.
- MICHAEL: Got ya, got ya...

32:55.959 --> 32:58.660
Move over a little bit.
Right, and one, two...

32:58.662 --> 33:01.062
- EDDIE: Okay, come on!
- TINA: You nearly got it!

33:01.064 --> 33:03.234
EDDIE: I think I can get this.

33:06.336 --> 33:08.669
- (pounding roof)
- TINA: Will it open?

33:08.671 --> 33:10.538
- Can you open it?
- Gimme the mallet!

33:10.540 --> 33:14.208
- The what?
- EDDIE: The mallet, the hammer!

33:14.210 --> 33:16.410
TINA: Okay, okay.

33:16.412 --> 33:18.947
- EDDIE: Come on, come on!
- Hit it harder!

33:18.949 --> 33:21.082
EDDIE: Come on, you bastard!

33:21.084 --> 33:24.919
Open up, you son of a bitch!

33:24.921 --> 33:26.754
Bitch! Okay, okay.

33:26.756 --> 33:28.489
Okay, okay, okay.

33:28.491 --> 33:31.124
Eve, in my back pocket,
there's a knife.

33:31.126 --> 33:32.494
Take it out.

33:32.496 --> 33:35.028
- EVE: I got it.
- EDDIE: Come on, you got it?

33:35.030 --> 33:38.032
EVE: I'm opening it for you.
Here, it's open.

33:38.034 --> 33:39.534
Okay, okay, all right.

33:39.536 --> 33:41.436
- JEFFREY: Anything, Eddie?
- EDDIE: Shit.

33:41.438 --> 33:44.706
- JEFFREY: You feel anything?
- EDDIE: (straining) Open up!

33:44.708 --> 33:47.040
- JEFFREY: Did you hit anything?
- EVE: Is it working?

33:47.042 --> 33:49.242
- EDDIE: Shit.
- JEFFREY: Come on, Ed, what have you got?

33:49.244 --> 33:50.980
- EDDIE: Damn it!
- JEFFREY: Anything?

33:52.315 --> 33:54.849
EDDIE: Shit!

33:54.851 --> 33:56.116
Damn it!

33:56.118 --> 33:59.153
Okay, okay, let me down,
easy. Easy.

33:59.155 --> 34:00.788
(Michael groans)

34:00.790 --> 34:02.925
- You okay?
- MICHAEL: My knee, my knee.

34:05.728 --> 34:08.630
Wait. Wait, wait, guys.
You hearing this?

34:08.632 --> 34:11.099
(muffled rumbling, creaking)

34:11.101 --> 34:12.431
EDDIE: Oh, man.

34:12.434 --> 34:15.135
She's talking to us.
She's not happy.

34:15.137 --> 34:18.409
- TINA: Who is?
- The building.

34:21.777 --> 34:24.646
All right, maybe we should empty
everything onto the floor.

34:24.648 --> 34:27.215
Dump our pockets,
purses, everything.

34:27.217 --> 34:28.815
- Why?
- I don't know why.

34:28.818 --> 34:31.688
Maybe one of us has
something we can use.

34:34.090 --> 34:36.458
I've got water.
I've got...

34:36.460 --> 34:38.525
Shit, I've got shit.
I've got shit.

34:38.527 --> 34:39.827
MICHAEL: It's just
envelopes, nothing.

34:39.829 --> 34:42.496
I got a bunch of losing
freakin' tickets.

34:42.498 --> 34:44.998
- TINA: Nail file?
- How big?

34:45.001 --> 34:46.402
TINA: Small.

34:47.936 --> 34:50.271
I got some mints.

34:50.273 --> 34:51.909
Oh, man.

35:23.206 --> 35:25.075
What if we make some noise?

35:27.344 --> 35:31.179
Well, all right then.
Let's make some noise.

35:31.181 --> 35:35.083
- (all screaming)
- Can you hear us?!

35:35.085 --> 35:37.651
Anyone!

35:37.653 --> 35:38.653
Help!

35:38.655 --> 35:40.621
- Help! Help!
- JEFFREY: Anyone!

35:40.623 --> 35:42.123
(pounding, screaming)

35:42.125 --> 35:44.291
Anybody!

35:44.293 --> 35:48.028
(muffled screams,
cables rattling)

35:48.030 --> 35:51.168
(screaming continues)

35:59.643 --> 36:01.409
Help!

36:01.411 --> 36:03.614
(screaming stops)

36:09.286 --> 36:11.651
WOMAN: <i>...through the
buildings and then went into</i>

36:11.653 --> 36:15.423
<i>the upper floors of
the World Trade Center tower.</i>

36:15.425 --> 36:18.927
LAUER: <i>I want to just mention that
when the impact hit the first tower,</i>

36:18.929 --> 36:21.628
<i>we hoped that people
who were in the second tower...</i>

36:21.630 --> 36:24.132
- EDDIE: <i>Metzie!</i>
- Yeah, go for Metzie.

36:24.134 --> 36:25.766
You get hold of Frankie?

36:25.768 --> 36:29.537
METZIE: <i>No! Literally,
all the elevator mechanics</i>

36:29.539 --> 36:32.639
were evacuated once
the second tower got hit.

36:32.641 --> 36:34.608
What about a channel?
You try a channel?

36:34.610 --> 36:37.177
METZIE: <i>You think I haven't tried that?
I've tried everything.</i>

36:37.179 --> 36:40.483
<i>Listen, there is so much chaos
down here, it's not even funny.</i>

36:41.952 --> 36:44.251
People are jumping.

36:44.253 --> 36:47.789
They're jumping off
the buildings?

36:47.791 --> 36:49.057
Oh, my God.

36:49.059 --> 36:51.425
- Oh my God.
- METZIE: <i>I told the firemen where you were.</i>

36:51.427 --> 36:53.394
<i>They know exactly
where you are</i>

36:53.396 --> 36:55.128
<i>and so as soon
as they get to you,</i>

36:55.130 --> 36:57.164
<i>they'll be able
to take care of it.</i>

36:57.166 --> 36:58.532
<i>I mean, listen...</i>

36:58.534 --> 37:02.135
Every department from all over
the city is here

37:02.137 --> 37:03.438
<i>trying to figure this out.</i>

37:03.440 --> 37:05.240
<i>I just need you
to hang in there.</i>

37:05.242 --> 37:07.575
Hang in there? What the fuck
do you mean "hang in there"?

37:07.577 --> 37:08.842
That's all we're doing
is hanging in here.

37:08.844 --> 37:10.478
<i>Where is the help, lady?!</i>

37:10.480 --> 37:12.581
TINA: <i>We need help, okay?
We need help!</i>

37:12.583 --> 37:15.782
- We have to get out of here now.
- Okay, guys, guys, please!

37:15.784 --> 37:18.385
Please, let's stay focused.

37:18.387 --> 37:20.787
Now, why is this...
this Frankie guy

37:20.789 --> 37:23.557
and all the mechanics
so goddamn important?

37:23.559 --> 37:25.760
Because they're the only ones
that work these things.

37:25.762 --> 37:28.265
We need them to release
the locks.

37:29.865 --> 37:31.599
Okay, okay.

37:31.601 --> 37:34.101
So, we don't need <i>them</i>
to release the lock.

37:34.103 --> 37:38.908
We need the information inside
their heads to release the lock.

37:41.311 --> 37:42.943
Frankie, Frankie,
Frank, Frank...

37:42.945 --> 37:44.945
Frankie's office!
Frankie's office!

37:44.947 --> 37:48.148
He's got all the manuals
up there along the wall.

37:48.150 --> 37:49.851
Wait, say that again?

37:49.853 --> 37:52.954
EDDIE: <i>Frankie's office, the
manuals to how these things work</i>

37:52.956 --> 37:55.322
are right there
behind his desk!

37:55.324 --> 37:58.659
Oh, shit. You're in
a new elevator, hang tight.

37:58.661 --> 38:01.795
They're in a new elevator,
retrofit, nobody knew.

38:01.797 --> 38:05.067
Damn, I gave them
bad information. Shit!

38:07.637 --> 38:09.436
MAN: What floor
are we on, Mike?

38:09.438 --> 38:11.505
MIKE: Not sure,
I stopped counting at 72.

38:11.507 --> 38:13.309
MAN: Keep goin', guys.

38:20.048 --> 38:22.219
Just keep moving!

38:27.824 --> 38:30.523
MICHAEL: I hope she finds
those manuals, man.

38:30.525 --> 38:32.559
Think she's gonna find them?

38:32.561 --> 38:34.061
EDDIE: Honestly, I don't know.

38:34.063 --> 38:37.264
She's got to make it all the way
down to the basement floor

38:37.266 --> 38:38.867
and then back up.

38:38.869 --> 38:42.271
It might be a while
before she gets back to us.

38:45.507 --> 38:47.176
I don't wanna die today.

38:49.811 --> 38:52.179
EDDIE: Nobody's gonna die.

38:52.181 --> 38:54.682
Nobody's gonna die, <i>mija,</i>
you hear me?

38:54.684 --> 38:56.086
You're gonna get
through this.

38:57.586 --> 38:59.855
We're all gonna
get through this.

39:00.922 --> 39:02.590
- (cell phone rings)
- MICHAEL: What?

39:02.592 --> 39:04.992
TINA: Which one is that?
Whose phone is that?

39:04.994 --> 39:07.762
- EVE: Shit! My phone.
- JEFFREY: Come on, where is it?

39:07.764 --> 39:10.164
EVE: It's my phone!
Yeah, yeah, I got it.

39:10.166 --> 39:11.865
(ringing continues)

39:11.867 --> 39:15.336
- Fuck! Where is it?
- JEFFREY: Eve, find it!

39:15.338 --> 39:17.438
Ahh! Yeah, yeah, yeah.

39:17.440 --> 39:19.907
- Hello!
- WOMAN: <i>Eve, where are you?</i>

39:19.909 --> 39:21.175
Oh, Mom, hi!

39:21.177 --> 39:23.744
Where the hell are you?
Are you in that building?

39:23.746 --> 39:25.246
Y-Yeah... just listen.

39:25.248 --> 39:27.914
We're... we're still
in the North Tower.

39:27.916 --> 39:30.651
<i>All right? And we're stuck.</i>

39:30.653 --> 39:32.519
<i>How is J.J. doing?</i>

39:32.521 --> 39:34.755
He's fine.
Are you together?

39:34.757 --> 39:38.325
Yes. We're technically
still married.

39:38.327 --> 39:39.693
Mom always liked me.

39:39.695 --> 39:43.231
- Can you... please... can you have her call my wife for me?
- Yes.

39:43.233 --> 39:44.865
Me too, me too?

39:44.867 --> 39:47.401
Mom, listen... listen to me.
I need you to concentrate.

39:47.403 --> 39:49.903
Get a pen and a paper. You're
gonna write down some numbers.

39:49.905 --> 39:52.206
Yes, of course,
of course. Of course.

39:52.208 --> 39:55.876
Let me find some paper.
I'm... okay, hang on.

39:55.878 --> 39:58.014
Hang on.

40:00.048 --> 40:01.282
Okay, go.

40:01.284 --> 40:03.583
You got it?
Yeah, hold on.

40:03.585 --> 40:05.987
Um, 212...

40:05.989 --> 40:08.188
356-5567.

40:08.190 --> 40:10.691
I'm Michael.
My wife's name is Holly.

40:10.693 --> 40:12.726
Okay, Michael.

40:12.728 --> 40:14.161
Yeah, uh, Eddie.

40:14.163 --> 40:20.467
And my number is 212-773-2755,
and my wife's name

40:20.469 --> 40:21.668
<i>is Gloria.</i>

40:21.670 --> 40:24.005
Okay, I've got it.

40:24.007 --> 40:25.008
Okay.

40:26.541 --> 40:27.775
I'm okay.

40:27.777 --> 40:29.179
EVE: No one?

40:30.413 --> 40:33.113
MOTHER: <i>Anything else?</i>

40:33.115 --> 40:36.217
Mom, can you put J.J.
on the phone, please?

40:36.219 --> 40:38.086
Of course,
he's right here. J.J.

40:38.088 --> 40:40.487
REPORTER: <i>I'm on the North
Lawn at the White house...</i>

40:40.489 --> 40:41.688
Mom?

40:41.690 --> 40:44.090
Hi, hiya, sweetheart.

40:44.092 --> 40:44.992
Hey, buddy.

40:44.994 --> 40:46.860
Mom and Dad, are you guys
watching this?

40:46.862 --> 40:49.764
Dad, your old building's
on fire.

40:49.766 --> 40:50.998
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

40:51.000 --> 40:54.802
Yeah, buddy, we're
watching it on television.

40:54.804 --> 40:57.771
J.J.: <i>Will the firemen
put the fire out?</i>

40:57.773 --> 40:59.807
Well... yeah,
of course they will.

40:59.809 --> 41:01.842
That's... that's what
they do, kiddo.

41:01.844 --> 41:04.677
Listen, baby, I need you
to do something for me.

41:04.679 --> 41:06.815
You have to stay
inside, okay?

41:06.817 --> 41:08.148
You and Nanna
need to stay home.

41:08.150 --> 41:09.883
I don't want you
going anywhere, alright?

41:09.885 --> 41:11.651
We were gonna go
to the park.

41:11.653 --> 41:14.054
JEFFREY: <i>J.J., your mother
said to stay put.</i>

41:14.056 --> 41:15.389
We'll find something to do.

41:15.391 --> 41:18.860
We're not moving until we
see them right in front of us.

41:18.862 --> 41:22.329
J.J.: <i>Come home soon, okay?
I love you guys.</i>

41:22.331 --> 41:24.566
I love you more, buddy.

41:24.568 --> 41:27.235
I love you so much.
Um, be good.

41:27.237 --> 41:29.737
Can you put Nanna on the
phone for a second, please?

41:29.739 --> 41:31.472
Here you go.

41:31.474 --> 41:34.008
Eve?

41:34.010 --> 41:36.043
Mom, will you please
put on one of his shows?

41:36.045 --> 41:39.813
I don't want him watching this
shit on TV, do you understand?

41:39.815 --> 41:41.382
<i>And, um...</i>

41:41.384 --> 41:44.485
Listen, you have to
make sure you give him

41:44.487 --> 41:46.189
<i>his medication,
he needs it.</i>

41:47.623 --> 41:50.124
Eve? Hello?

41:50.126 --> 41:52.559
Hello?

41:52.561 --> 41:54.028
Hello!

41:54.030 --> 41:56.798
Shit!
The thing...

41:56.800 --> 41:59.534
It's okay.
It's okay.

41:59.536 --> 42:01.501
She doesn't give him
his thing!

42:01.503 --> 42:02.869
It's all right.

42:02.871 --> 42:04.472
Oh, my God.

42:04.474 --> 42:06.441
Okay.

42:06.443 --> 42:07.742
It's gonna be
okay, right?

42:07.744 --> 42:12.112
- Yes.
- Okay. I'm sorry.

42:12.114 --> 42:14.048
COURIC: <i>...President Bush
to arrive there, Bob?</i>

42:14.050 --> 42:16.818
BOB: <i>Well, Katie,
he's coming back directly</i>

42:16.820 --> 42:18.885
<i>and you figure it's
about a two-hour flight,</i>

42:18.887 --> 42:21.054
<i>so, uh, you can do the math.</i>

42:21.056 --> 42:23.590
<i>The reason I said that it was</i>

42:23.592 --> 42:27.228
<i>so surreal was that, within
just about 20 minutes ago,</i>

42:27.230 --> 42:28.795
<i>they were still
conducting tours.</i>

42:28.797 --> 42:32.032
<i>You had hordes
of tourists and others</i>

42:32.034 --> 42:34.034
<i>still in the White House
on tour,</i>

42:34.036 --> 42:35.836
<i>lining up outside to get in.</i>

42:35.838 --> 42:38.539
<i>There seemed to be
absolutely no unusual...</i>

42:38.541 --> 42:40.476
(alarm whirring)

42:49.751 --> 42:51.418
(exhales)

42:51.420 --> 42:52.853
(gasp)

42:52.855 --> 42:56.960
Yes, thank you, God.
Thank you, thank you!

42:59.228 --> 43:02.695
<i>Today, we've had
a national tragedy.</i>

43:02.697 --> 43:08.068
<i>Two airplanes have crashed
into the World Trade Center</i>

43:08.070 --> 43:11.074
<i>in an apparent terrorist attack

<i>I have spoken
to the vice-president,</i>

<i>to the governor of New York,
to the director of the FBI,</i>

43:20.516 --> 43:24.719
<i>and have ordered that the full
resources of the federal government</i>

43:24.721 --> 43:27.987
<i>go to help the victims
and their families</i>

43:27.989 --> 43:31.360
<i>and to conduct
a full-scale investigation...</i>

43:32.929 --> 43:36.697
<i>to hunt down and to find
those folks</i>

43:36.699 --> 43:38.566
<i>who committed this act.</i>

43:38.568 --> 43:42.272
<i>Terrorism against our nation
will not stand.</i>

43:43.672 --> 43:46.475
<i>And now if you'll join me
in a moment of silence.</i>

43:48.744 --> 43:51.778
<i>May God bless the victims,
their families, and America.</i>

43:51.780 --> 43:53.481
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

43:53.483 --> 43:54.749
Okay.

43:54.751 --> 43:56.751
Guys better get on it.

43:56.753 --> 43:59.787
Call your families,
let 'em know you're all right.

43:59.789 --> 44:03.791
Go on now, I got it. I got this.
I've just got to talk to them.

44:03.793 --> 44:05.929
Go ahead, man.

44:19.509 --> 44:20.773
So...

44:20.775 --> 44:23.244
went to my doctor this morning.

44:23.246 --> 44:26.414
He said that he was gonna need
a, uh...

44:26.416 --> 44:30.885
a urine sample and blood sample
and a stool sample.

44:30.887 --> 44:33.019
And I said, "You know what?

44:33.021 --> 44:36.657
Why don't you just
take my underwear?"

44:36.659 --> 44:39.025
(chuckles softly)

44:39.027 --> 44:42.530
Take my underwear? No?

44:42.532 --> 44:43.967
No.

44:46.635 --> 44:49.202
(Michael sighs)

44:49.204 --> 44:52.438
Jeffrey? Really?
You're gonna do that now?

44:52.440 --> 44:54.310
(snaps lighter shut)

44:57.313 --> 45:00.450
Mr. Cage, you have
jets and stuff?

45:01.650 --> 45:04.318
No, I don't have jets and stuff.

45:04.320 --> 45:06.088
What is with you and money?

45:07.155 --> 45:09.960
I just never had money
like that, that's all.

45:11.460 --> 45:13.693
Well, unless you're an airline,
it's a little excessive

45:13.695 --> 45:16.363
to have more than one jet.

45:16.365 --> 45:19.465
So you have a jet?
Who gets the jet?

45:19.467 --> 45:22.735
- (Eve laughs)
- That, I get to keep.

45:22.737 --> 45:24.271
Yeah, of course you do.

45:24.273 --> 45:26.373
Can it make it
all the way to Hawaii?

45:26.375 --> 45:28.008
It depends where you leave from.

45:28.010 --> 45:31.278
If we left from here, we'd have
to stop in Los Angeles to refuel.

45:31.280 --> 45:33.347
See, I always wanted
to go to Hawaii.

45:33.349 --> 45:38.318
I promised my wife for our 10th
wedding anniversary, yeah.

45:38.320 --> 45:41.787
Just that we never had
that kind of cash, so...

45:41.789 --> 45:44.191
We go to Orchard Beach.

45:44.193 --> 45:45.728
Yeah.

45:46.996 --> 45:49.499
And what happened?
You lose it all?

45:51.000 --> 45:53.202
I guess you could
say that.

45:54.403 --> 45:55.739
How much?

45:56.940 --> 45:59.275
That depends
who I'm lying to.

46:01.210 --> 46:04.010
What are we talking,
tables, sports, ponies?

46:04.012 --> 46:05.311
All of them.

46:05.313 --> 46:07.880
A few tough beats,
you know.

46:07.882 --> 46:09.816
Started looking around...

46:09.818 --> 46:14.153
Next thing, I'm hiding from
my bookie at the racetrack.

46:14.155 --> 46:17.592
And all I'm thinking is like,
"Yo, I'm gonna double

46:17.594 --> 46:20.394
my daughter's college fund
with this one bet."

46:20.396 --> 46:24.998
Walk into my house with a
big stack, be this hero.

46:25.000 --> 46:27.501
Yeah. I mean that's...

46:27.503 --> 46:29.936
what I'm always thinking
in my mind, you know,

46:29.938 --> 46:31.472
a hero.

46:31.474 --> 46:34.708
Just that it never
goes down like that.

46:34.710 --> 46:36.209
So...

46:36.211 --> 46:39.347
But you're still
chasing it.

46:39.349 --> 46:42.383
Shit, isn't that... isn't that
what we're all doing?

46:42.385 --> 46:44.721
Chasing that big brass ring?

46:45.855 --> 46:47.054
Not me.

46:47.056 --> 46:48.988
Don't kid yourself,
<i>mija.</i>

46:48.990 --> 46:52.392
That's what people in this whole
city are doing all the time, okay.

46:52.394 --> 46:54.961
Oh, please.
You don't know me.

46:54.963 --> 46:56.666
You don't know
anything about me.

47:06.943 --> 47:10.911
I came here today
to tell him it was over.

47:10.913 --> 47:12.648
EVE: Who? Your boyfriend?

47:14.516 --> 47:16.217
If you want
to call him that.

47:16.219 --> 47:17.617
He's far
from being a boy

47:17.619 --> 47:19.487
and sure as shit
isn't my friend.

47:19.489 --> 47:22.155
Is he good-looking
at least?

47:22.157 --> 47:23.990
Let's say he's older.

47:23.992 --> 47:26.025
A lot older.

47:26.027 --> 47:28.195
The silver fox type?

47:28.197 --> 47:29.996
TINA: He's definitely
not a ten.

47:29.998 --> 47:32.835
But then neither
am I.

47:34.304 --> 47:35.534
Oh.

47:35.536 --> 47:37.972
To me you're a...
you're a ten.

47:37.974 --> 47:39.375
Oh, yeah.

47:42.711 --> 47:44.313
Are you hitting on me?

47:45.713 --> 47:48.382
Is this you fucking
hitting on me, Eddie?

47:48.384 --> 47:50.083
Cause you've had
your eyes all over me

47:50.085 --> 47:51.552
since you've got
into this elevator.

47:51.554 --> 47:53.153
- EVE: Tina.
- Don't think I haven't noticed! What?!

47:53.155 --> 47:56.490
Calm down. That's not
what's happening here.

47:56.492 --> 47:59.726
And, sweetheart, do I have to remind
you you have had a couple of pills?

47:59.728 --> 48:02.362
Sure, it's the pills,
it's not the pills.

48:02.364 --> 48:04.298
It doesn't matter
what it is.

48:04.300 --> 48:07.334
It's nice to go out to
dinners and buy nice clothes

48:07.336 --> 48:10.403
and have a sweet
apartment in downtown.

48:10.405 --> 48:14.541
But at the end,
you don't own any of it.

48:14.543 --> 48:15.612
None of it.

48:17.112 --> 48:19.382
It owns you.

48:20.983 --> 48:24.487
He... owns you.

48:27.356 --> 48:30.224
Shit... it's
gonna sound awful,

48:30.226 --> 48:32.860
but he's up there,
and I'm here.

48:32.862 --> 48:34.364
And...

48:36.097 --> 48:38.599
part of me just...

48:38.601 --> 48:41.604
hopes the son
of a bitch dies.

48:47.777 --> 48:49.378
What?

48:52.248 --> 48:54.947
What, are we going around
the room now, it's my turn?

48:54.949 --> 48:57.751
No, I pass.
No, thank you.

48:57.753 --> 48:59.119
Uh...

48:59.121 --> 49:02.555
I mean, I love my wife,
I love my baby girl.

49:02.557 --> 49:04.490
You know,
I ain't havin' no affairs.

49:04.492 --> 49:06.525
I don't have
no sugar mamas.

49:06.527 --> 49:08.595
I don't have no
gay shit going on.

49:08.597 --> 49:10.463
None of that.
You guys can relax.

49:10.465 --> 49:14.700
You know, with me, what you
see is exactly what you get.

49:14.702 --> 49:17.706
So... next.

49:21.043 --> 49:23.275
How did you hurt
your knee?

49:23.277 --> 49:24.577
I'm a messenger.

49:24.579 --> 49:26.112
I'm a bike messenger
in New York City.

49:26.114 --> 49:27.548
I mean, shit happens.

49:27.550 --> 49:30.486
I'm not sitting in the back of
no black limousine like you.

49:31.721 --> 49:32.918
Did you get hit?

49:32.920 --> 49:34.889
Yeah, hit-and-run.
Cabbie.

49:34.891 --> 49:37.293
Pakistani motherfucker,
too.

49:38.561 --> 49:40.494
So, if it was
a hit-and-run,

49:40.496 --> 49:42.496
then how did you know
where he was from?

49:42.498 --> 49:46.235
I mean, I just know.
I mean, I... I know.

49:48.603 --> 49:50.304
Did you even see
his face?

49:50.306 --> 49:51.472
I didn't have to see
his face.

49:51.474 --> 49:53.507
I'm on my bike, like, eight,
nine hours a day.

49:53.509 --> 49:55.775
I see these guys all the time in
their cabs. Like what do you mean?

49:55.777 --> 49:59.813
- (Eve groans) -The only ones worse
than the Pakis be the Filipinos.

49:59.815 --> 50:02.148
- EVE: Oh, my God.
- Crazy behind the wheel. Asian.

50:02.150 --> 50:04.050
With that Asian vibe.

50:04.052 --> 50:08.755
Well, the Philippines are considered
to be part of Asia, so...

50:08.757 --> 50:11.691
Anyway, like I said, I don't
wanna talk about my shit.

50:11.693 --> 50:14.394
So you didn't have
any shit.

50:14.396 --> 50:16.362
You say you were
perfect.

50:16.364 --> 50:18.365
Wait a minute,
I never said I was per...

50:18.367 --> 50:20.900
I never said any
of those type of words.

50:20.902 --> 50:22.401
Fuckin' never.

50:22.403 --> 50:27.106
What I said was that
what you see is what you get.

50:27.108 --> 50:28.909
That's what I said, Eduardo.

50:28.911 --> 50:33.280
The name is Eddie, okay?
It's short for Edwin.

50:33.282 --> 50:35.282
There's no fucking
Eduardo here.

50:35.284 --> 50:37.418
- You could have fooled me.
- EDDIE: Oh, really?

50:37.420 --> 50:38.885
Oh, so that's how
it's gonna be?

50:38.887 --> 50:40.586
We're gonna do this
Black-Latino shit here?

50:40.588 --> 50:42.856
I ain't doin' shit. You
doin' somethin' right now.

50:42.858 --> 50:45.892
Hey, hey, hey, hey, fellas.
Fellas, come on.

50:45.894 --> 50:47.494
- What? Tell him.
- Tell <i>him!</i>

50:47.496 --> 50:50.300
Hey, hey, I am telling
both of you.

50:51.233 --> 50:55.235
- Well, yessir, boss.
- (scoffs) Wow.

50:55.237 --> 50:57.737
You're really gonna
go there, too.

50:57.739 --> 51:00.474
Not everybody has, you know,
their own private plane,

51:00.476 --> 51:02.545
so I should just hush,
right?

51:04.246 --> 51:06.983
Do you know why I have
my own jet, Michael?

51:08.351 --> 51:10.019
Uh... let me think.

51:12.153 --> 51:14.121
White...

51:14.123 --> 51:16.557
rich guy.

51:16.559 --> 51:18.691
You know,
for your information,

51:18.693 --> 51:20.494
this guy doesn't come
from money.

51:20.496 --> 51:22.028
His dad worked
in a factory.

51:22.030 --> 51:23.563
His mom died
when he was 12.

51:23.565 --> 51:25.664
He went to
a public school,

51:25.666 --> 51:28.135
and when he
barely graduated,

51:28.137 --> 51:29.603
he went to work
alongside his father

51:29.605 --> 51:32.338
and all of his brothers,
and that was it,

51:32.340 --> 51:35.641
that was decided, that's as
far as this guy was gonna go.

51:35.643 --> 51:37.644
But you know
what he did?

51:37.646 --> 51:40.012
He refused
to accept that story,

51:40.014 --> 51:43.249
because he imagined something
bigger for himself.

51:43.251 --> 51:46.786
So, at 18 years old,
with $60 in his pocket,

51:46.788 --> 51:49.190
he hopped on a bus
to New York City,

51:49.192 --> 51:50.391
and that's where...

51:50.393 --> 51:51.994
I met you.

51:56.599 --> 52:00.103
Yes... that's where
he met me.

52:02.371 --> 52:03.936
So, Michael...

52:03.938 --> 52:08.307
you could be mad at everything
that you don't have

52:08.309 --> 52:11.043
or envious of people who have
way more than they need,

52:11.045 --> 52:14.514
but you have no idea
what people go through

52:14.516 --> 52:15.849
to get
to where they are,

52:15.851 --> 52:18.217
or how much money
they give to charity,

52:18.219 --> 52:22.521
or how they fund kids so
they can all go to college.

52:22.523 --> 52:24.456
That's who
this guy is.

52:24.458 --> 52:27.396
All right?
That's who he is.

52:29.164 --> 52:31.434
Then why are you
divorcing him?

52:49.018 --> 52:52.151
(line ringing)

52:52.153 --> 52:53.586
WOMAN: <i>Hello.</i>

52:53.588 --> 52:56.389
- Hello?
- <i>Sí,</i> yes?

52:56.391 --> 53:00.561
Is that...
Is this Eddie's wife, Gloria?

53:00.563 --> 53:02.463
<i>Yes. Who is this?</i>

53:02.465 --> 53:04.630
Yes, um...

53:04.632 --> 53:06.032
(TV coverage in background)

53:06.034 --> 53:07.668
<i>You don't know me.
I'm calling you...</i>

53:07.670 --> 53:09.838
<i>for your husband.</i>

53:11.505 --> 53:13.139
<i>You probably
know what's going on.</i>

53:13.141 --> 53:14.840
<i>He's...</i>

53:14.842 --> 53:19.045
<i>At present he's in an elevator
and the elevator's stopped,</i>

53:19.047 --> 53:21.380
<i>and they're stuck
with a group of people,</i>

53:21.382 --> 53:23.150
<i>amongst them my daughter.</i>

53:23.152 --> 53:26.253
<i>Everybody's safe and...</i>

53:26.255 --> 53:29.789
<i>he wanted you to know that...</i>

53:29.791 --> 53:32.695
<i>that he loves you very much.</i>

53:49.043 --> 53:51.112
(sobbing)

54:04.193 --> 54:06.260
(coughing)

54:06.262 --> 54:08.595
JEFFREY: Can you grab
that water?

54:08.597 --> 54:10.197
EVE: What are you doing?

54:10.199 --> 54:14.400
You guys have all seen those
hotel safety videos, right?

54:14.402 --> 54:16.836
(coughing)

54:16.838 --> 54:18.671
I'm just gonna make
some handkerchiefs.

54:18.673 --> 54:20.976
We can filter the smoke.

54:23.612 --> 54:26.947
It's the most expensive
hankie I've ever had.

54:26.949 --> 54:28.481
Italian?

54:28.483 --> 54:34.320
Nah, it's David August.
Made in America.

54:34.322 --> 54:36.092
EDDIE:
(coughing) Just like me.

54:38.327 --> 54:40.327
- Eddie.
- EDDIE: Yeah?

54:40.329 --> 54:42.496
JEFFREY: Whaddya say we...

54:42.498 --> 54:44.200
try and pry
those doors open again?

54:46.135 --> 54:47.633
We could try.

54:47.635 --> 54:49.936
But we open it, there's gonna be
more smoke coming in.

54:49.938 --> 54:51.974
Well, you got
any better suggestions?

54:53.409 --> 54:55.075
- All right.
- Okay.

54:55.077 --> 54:56.842
Then we'll pry
something in there.

54:56.844 --> 54:58.545
- JEFFREY: Michael.
- MICHAEL: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

54:58.547 --> 55:00.447
Let's see if we can
get them open.

55:00.449 --> 55:01.682
I'm gonna put
the bag in there.

55:01.684 --> 55:03.615
Stick something... Your
helmet, your bag, something.

55:03.617 --> 55:05.450
Eddie, go, go!
Ready?

55:05.452 --> 55:06.653
Okay...

55:06.655 --> 55:08.554
EDDIE: One... two...

55:08.556 --> 55:09.789
BOTH: Three.

55:09.791 --> 55:11.894
- JEFFREY: Okay.
- (straining)

55:14.597 --> 55:16.195
- (straining, coughing)
- MICHAEL: Okay.

55:16.197 --> 55:18.164
EDDIE: Oh, shit.

55:18.166 --> 55:22.034
Fuck, it's like fuckin' 50
degrees warmer out here.

55:22.036 --> 55:25.003
- JEFFREY: Can you see anything?
- EVE: Can we get out?

55:25.005 --> 55:27.273
Between floors,
a landing, anything?

55:27.275 --> 55:29.175
(banging wall)

55:29.177 --> 55:30.711
(coughing)

55:30.713 --> 55:33.646
- EDDIE: Gimme a screwdriver.
- TINA: A screwdriver.

55:33.648 --> 55:35.248
MICHAEL: Oh, shit.

55:35.250 --> 55:37.117
Where's the screwdriver?

55:37.119 --> 55:40.220
- WOMEN: It's here, it's here!
- EDDIE: Fuckin' screwdriver.

55:40.222 --> 55:42.057
Some water? Water?

55:47.996 --> 55:50.563
- EDDIE: I'll be goddamned!
- MICHAEL: What's going on?

55:50.565 --> 55:52.199
EDDIE: This is sheetrock.

55:52.201 --> 55:54.668
- EDDIE: It's soft.
- MICHAEL: That's good.

55:54.670 --> 55:56.702
EDDIE: These shafts
don't have cement.

55:56.704 --> 55:57.903
It's drywall.

55:57.905 --> 56:01.074
Maybe I could...
I could keep...

56:01.076 --> 56:03.543
(coughing)

56:03.545 --> 56:06.447
I could keep digging at it,
and maybe...

56:06.449 --> 56:10.416
maybe we could get
all the way through.

56:10.418 --> 56:12.351
Son of a bitch!

56:12.353 --> 56:14.354
(groans)

56:14.356 --> 56:15.822
(sighs)

56:15.824 --> 56:17.490
JEFFREY:
What's going on?

56:17.492 --> 56:19.592
EDDIE: Fuck.

56:19.594 --> 56:21.695
Oh, man.
I'm losing my breath, man.

56:21.697 --> 56:23.829
- JEFFREY: No, no, no.
- EDDIE: I can't breathe.

56:23.831 --> 56:25.097
My heart's racing.

56:25.099 --> 56:27.166
You're fine, brother,
you're fine.

56:27.168 --> 56:28.769
Are you a doctor now?

56:28.771 --> 56:30.938
I don't think so.
I can't...

56:30.940 --> 56:33.005
What's going on?
What's it feel like?

56:33.007 --> 56:34.641
Are you constricted?
Is your arm okay?

56:34.643 --> 56:35.909
Okay, wait, wait.
I feel...

56:35.911 --> 56:37.510
Feel like I'm having
a heart attack.

56:37.512 --> 56:38.778
I feel... my heart.

56:38.780 --> 56:40.447
EVE: Does that run
in your family?

56:40.449 --> 56:44.050
I can't breathe. I'm Puerto Rican.
I'm Puerto Rican, okay?

56:44.052 --> 56:46.619
Fuckin' heart disease
is a birthright with us.

56:46.621 --> 56:49.222
Eddie, look at me.
Take these.

56:49.224 --> 56:51.258
What's that?
That's for a heart attack?

56:51.260 --> 56:54.026
I'm having a heart attack.
I'm having a heart attack.

56:54.028 --> 56:56.463
- No, you're not having a heart attack.
- I can feel.

56:56.465 --> 56:59.365
Be quiet.
You have to be quiet.

56:59.367 --> 57:00.534
Okay. Oh, God, please.

57:00.536 --> 57:02.202
- Don't breathe too hard.
- Please, please.

57:02.204 --> 57:04.137
Have you ever had
a heart attack?

57:04.139 --> 57:06.773
EDDIE: Help me down.
Please help me down.

57:06.775 --> 57:09.409
- Let me sit down.
- Okay, alright.

57:09.411 --> 57:11.345
TINA: Relax.
It's gonna be okay.

57:11.347 --> 57:12.211
Trust me,
I know the difference

57:12.213 --> 57:13.914
between a panic attack
and a heart attack.

57:13.916 --> 57:16.883
- EVE: You good?
- Okay? You can relax? You okay?

57:16.885 --> 57:18.651
- EVE: Good?
- EDDIE: I wanna get outta here!

57:18.653 --> 57:20.554
I know, I know.

57:20.556 --> 57:21.820
(coughing)

57:21.822 --> 57:24.359
(Eddie groans, sighs)

57:30.097 --> 57:32.999
Oh, I'm so the wrong person
for this.

57:33.001 --> 57:35.068
MAN: <i>...what steps
are taken next.</i>

57:35.070 --> 57:36.369
COURIC: <i>David, I'm sorry
to interrupt you,</i>

57:36.371 --> 57:39.104
<i>but we're looking at
live pictures of the Pentagon</i>

57:39.106 --> 57:41.374
<i>where there
is billowing smoke...</i>

57:41.376 --> 57:42.943
Come on.

57:42.945 --> 57:45.445
<i>...just reported that he heard
an explosion,</i>

57:45.447 --> 57:47.780
<i>and right now we're looking
at an aerial view</i>

57:47.782 --> 57:49.048
<i>of the Pentagon.</i>

57:49.050 --> 57:50.883
<i>Nick, can you talk to us?</i>

57:50.885 --> 57:53.686
NICK: <i>Officially, nobody
knows exactly what happened.</i>

57:53.688 --> 57:56.289
<i>I think the picture
is pretty clear.</i>

57:56.291 --> 57:59.391
(coughing)

57:59.393 --> 58:03.996
METZIE: <i>Hey, uh,
can you hear me, guys? Hello?</i>

58:03.998 --> 58:05.699
Metzie, this is
Jeffrey!

58:05.701 --> 58:07.333
Hey, Jeffrey, um...

58:07.335 --> 58:09.670
I don't want to make you
nervous or anything,

58:09.672 --> 58:11.938
but I am not sure
what I'm looking at.

58:11.940 --> 58:16.809
I got these blueprints
and it says that...

58:16.811 --> 58:20.012
the solenoid...

58:20.014 --> 58:23.282
is in, like, the locking thing?

58:23.284 --> 58:27.688
<i>And it's like a cylinder,
and it's probably about...</i>

58:27.690 --> 58:31.525
four inches long
and it's kind of...

58:31.527 --> 58:33.427
You know, it's a locking thing.

58:33.429 --> 58:34.726
<i>Do you see it?</i>

58:34.728 --> 58:36.563
How many stable positions
does it have?

58:36.565 --> 58:39.164
(irritated) <i>I don't know how
many stable positions it has.</i>

58:39.166 --> 58:41.802
Give me some paper and a pen.
Okay, right.

58:41.804 --> 58:43.537
All right, hold on, hold on.

58:43.539 --> 58:45.637
Hold on. Okay, Metzie.

58:45.639 --> 58:47.106
<i>Tell me the diagram, please!</i>

58:47.108 --> 58:50.209
METZIE: The blocking system
is called the solenoid.

58:50.211 --> 58:54.179
There's a blocking solenoid
and it looks like a cylinder.

58:54.181 --> 58:57.016
<i>And below it, just below it,</i>

58:57.018 --> 58:59.885
<i>there's like
a little plunger thing,</i>

58:59.887 --> 59:02.121
<i>and then the solenoid itself</i>

59:02.123 --> 59:05.458
is four inches long
with one-inch diameter

59:05.460 --> 59:09.695
<i>and it's at the top of the door
on the left side.</i>

59:09.697 --> 59:11.831
Okay, I got it.

59:11.833 --> 59:14.633
Now, can you tell me how
it's mounted, please?

59:14.635 --> 59:16.168
METZIE: <i>It's...</i>

59:16.170 --> 59:20.907
<i>at the top of the door
on the left side.</i>

59:20.909 --> 59:22.608
That's what it says
in the book.

59:22.610 --> 59:24.911
Okay. Okay.

59:24.913 --> 59:26.512
All right, got that.

59:26.514 --> 59:28.849
WOMAN: <i>...sources are
confirming the report</i>

59:28.851 --> 59:31.483
<i>that one of the planes
was a hijacked flight,</i>

59:31.485 --> 59:35.454
<i>an American flight from Boston
to Los Angeles.</i>

59:35.456 --> 59:40.260
<i>They are also now looking into
what's going on at the Pentagon.</i>

59:40.262 --> 59:42.896
<i>They don't have any details
but they have now put</i>

59:42.898 --> 59:47.066
<i>government buildings
around the city of Washington</i>

59:47.068 --> 59:48.802
<i>on a heightened state
of alert.</i>

59:48.804 --> 59:50.103
Okay.

59:50.105 --> 59:52.204
I know what
we're looking for.

59:52.206 --> 59:54.807
But it doesn't matter,
we can't see it.

59:54.809 --> 59:58.311
Yeah, listen.
Uh, anybody got a mirror?

59:58.313 --> 01:00:01.046
I have a mirror,
I have a mirror in my bag.

01:00:01.048 --> 01:00:02.882
EDDIE: All right, come here.
And flashlight.

01:00:02.884 --> 01:00:04.751
- JEFFREY: I got that.
- EDDIE: With the mirror.

01:00:04.753 --> 01:00:07.454
All right, okay. All right.

01:00:07.456 --> 01:00:10.990
- Where do you want me?
- EDDIE: Point it out here.

01:00:10.992 --> 01:00:13.025
Out here.
Come on, come on.

01:00:13.027 --> 01:00:14.260
All right, all right.

01:00:14.262 --> 01:00:17.530
Can you point it up
a little bit?

01:00:17.532 --> 01:00:19.666
- JEFFREY: Tell me where.
- EDDIE: A little bit to the right.

01:00:19.668 --> 01:00:22.936
Okay, okay, just a tick
to the left.

01:00:22.938 --> 01:00:24.170
JEFFREY: Right there?

01:00:24.172 --> 01:00:27.039
EDDIE: Right there...
Okay, there.

01:00:27.041 --> 01:00:28.708
- JEFFREY: You see it?
- EDDIE: Yes.

01:00:28.710 --> 01:00:30.510
Can you reach it?

01:00:30.512 --> 01:00:33.479
EDDIE: I'm gonna need a good
three, four more feet,

01:00:33.481 --> 01:00:34.847
at least.

01:00:34.849 --> 01:00:37.416
All right, okay, I know
what we gotta do.

01:00:37.418 --> 01:00:39.485
We gotta figure out
how I'm gonna get up there.

01:00:39.487 --> 01:00:41.088
All right.

01:00:41.090 --> 01:00:43.423
MICHAEL: Just, just, just,
just... just hop on my knee.

01:00:43.425 --> 01:00:45.791
- (coughing)
- MICHAEL: Hop on my knee.

01:00:45.793 --> 01:00:47.760
EDDIE: You gotta...

01:00:47.762 --> 01:00:49.929
help me up there,
brace me.

01:00:49.931 --> 01:00:52.898
Ready? One, two, three, go!

01:00:52.900 --> 01:00:56.869
Okay, okay. Can you hand me
the pliers? Pliers.

01:00:56.871 --> 01:00:58.438
TINA: Hold it, hold it.

01:00:58.440 --> 01:00:59.972
EDDIE: Okay.

01:00:59.974 --> 01:01:03.041
(coughing)

01:01:03.043 --> 01:01:04.844
JEFFREY: Listen, Eddie.

01:01:04.846 --> 01:01:06.780
We make it out of here

01:01:06.782 --> 01:01:08.914
and you wanna still
keep gambling,

01:01:08.916 --> 01:01:10.950
you look me up.

01:01:10.952 --> 01:01:14.253
I will put you in
a whole different casino

01:01:14.255 --> 01:01:17.858
and you'll bring home a lot
more winners than losers.

01:01:17.860 --> 01:01:20.260
That's a bet, Jeff.
That's a bet, okay?

01:01:20.262 --> 01:01:23.061
Okay. Okay. All right, guys.

01:01:23.063 --> 01:01:24.930
Eve, a little more
this way, please.

01:01:24.932 --> 01:01:26.365
A little more.

01:01:26.367 --> 01:01:27.766
- EVE: Yes!
- EDDIE: Right there.

01:01:27.768 --> 01:01:29.403
EDDIE: Hold it!
Hold it, okay.

01:01:29.405 --> 01:01:30.903
I can feel...

01:01:30.905 --> 01:01:33.375
Shit, I can feel...

01:01:35.210 --> 01:01:38.010
Okay, I've got something here.

01:01:38.012 --> 01:01:39.979
Okay, guys, I need
about another inch.

01:01:39.981 --> 01:01:41.113
I feel...

01:01:41.115 --> 01:01:43.318
Oh, shit, I can feel...

01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:46.184
There.

01:01:46.186 --> 01:01:48.688
- Okay.
- JEFFREY: Hold it.

01:01:48.690 --> 01:01:50.259
EDDIE: I got it.

01:01:52.193 --> 01:01:53.793
- EDDIE: Fuck!
- MICHAEL: Shit!

01:01:53.795 --> 01:01:56.195
Shit! All right.
Give me, uh...

01:01:56.197 --> 01:01:57.863
- MICHAEL: What do you need?
- Screwdriver!

01:01:57.865 --> 01:01:59.965
- (shouting)
- EDDIE: Screwdriver.

01:01:59.967 --> 01:02:02.068
- EDDIE: Screwdriver
- EVE: Hurry up!

01:02:02.070 --> 01:02:04.269
- Okay.
- TINA: Okay? Oh, God.

01:02:04.271 --> 01:02:07.240
- All right.
- JEFFREY: You still need the mirror?

01:02:07.242 --> 01:02:09.141
- TINA: Where's the mirror?
- MICHAEL: I don't know.

01:02:09.143 --> 01:02:11.644
I got it,
I know what I'm looking for.

01:02:11.646 --> 01:02:12.845
EVE: Okay, good.

01:02:12.847 --> 01:02:14.581
EDDIE: Hold on, guys.

01:02:14.583 --> 01:02:16.182
(coughing)

01:02:16.184 --> 01:02:18.586
EDDIE: Okay, okay, almost...
almost...

01:02:21.088 --> 01:02:23.555
Guys, I need
another inch, please.

01:02:23.557 --> 01:02:26.161
(straining)

01:02:33.101 --> 01:02:36.269
Open the door!
Open the door!

01:02:36.271 --> 01:02:37.903
JEFFREY: Right there!

01:02:37.905 --> 01:02:40.275
(cheering)

01:02:43.210 --> 01:02:45.612
Metzie!
Metzie, we did it!

01:02:45.614 --> 01:02:46.813
We got it!

01:02:46.815 --> 01:02:48.248
What did you do?

01:02:48.250 --> 01:02:50.115
We opened the door.

01:02:50.117 --> 01:02:52.584
- <i>We opened the door.</i>
- Yes, okay.

01:02:52.586 --> 01:02:53.853
METZIE: <i>Hey, listen!
What can you see?</i>

01:02:53.855 --> 01:02:55.621
Okay, we're in
between floors.

01:02:55.623 --> 01:02:58.157
All right, we can't get
to the floor above us

01:02:58.159 --> 01:03:00.092
and we can't get
to the landing below us,

01:03:00.094 --> 01:03:02.961
<i>so we're gonna have to
dig our way out of here.</i>

01:03:02.963 --> 01:03:05.932
Dig your way...?
Hold on a minute.

01:03:05.934 --> 01:03:07.900
EDDIE: <i>The shaft walls,
they're soft.</i>

01:03:07.902 --> 01:03:09.702
- <i>They ain't cement.</i>
- METZIE: I know.

01:03:09.704 --> 01:03:11.637
You're in the mechanical shaft.

01:03:11.639 --> 01:03:13.972
EDDIE: We're gonna go
through the wall!

01:03:13.974 --> 01:03:17.943
There you go.
There you go.

01:03:17.945 --> 01:03:20.847
Can I get that mallet,
please?

01:03:20.849 --> 01:03:23.016
EVE: Cover your faces.

01:03:23.018 --> 01:03:25.818
EDDIE: Oh, shit.
Okay, here we go, guys.

01:03:25.820 --> 01:03:27.456
Here we go, here we go.

01:03:29.291 --> 01:03:31.093
(clang)

01:03:32.559 --> 01:03:34.630
Fuck!

01:03:39.967 --> 01:03:41.467
JAMIE:
<i>...and they said, quote,</i>

01:03:41.469 --> 01:03:45.003
<i>that this was
"clearly terrorist related,</i>

01:03:45.005 --> 01:03:46.639
<i>no question about it."</i>

01:03:46.641 --> 01:03:49.575
<i>They said that they couldn't
give any details now,</i>

01:03:49.577 --> 01:03:52.144
<i>not because they didn't
want to share it</i>

01:03:52.146 --> 01:03:53.979
<i>but because they just
don't know yet,</i>

01:03:53.981 --> 01:03:55.615
<i>they're in
the earliest stages.</i>

01:03:55.617 --> 01:03:59.286
COURIC: <i>So do they know, Jamie,
for example, if a plane...</i>

01:03:59.288 --> 01:04:01.856
(somber music rises)

01:04:15.302 --> 01:04:18.172
(music continues)

01:04:28.583 --> 01:04:31.152
(muted TV coverage)

01:04:37.324 --> 01:04:39.726
