00:05.005 --> 00:07.573
Parker, what do you
want in your lunch?

00:07.575 --> 00:08.974
Apple or banana?

00:08.976 --> 00:10.876
Keep going until
you get to cupcake.

00:13.246 --> 00:15.748
Good morning, fellow rooneys.

00:15.750 --> 00:18.751
Today is the first day
of the rest of your lives...

00:18.753 --> 00:19.852
With me.

00:20.787 --> 00:21.987
Hey, Hollywood.

00:21.989 --> 00:23.589
Tomorrow, less time
in the shower.

00:23.591 --> 00:26.525
It makes it really hard
to shave.

00:28.661 --> 00:32.131
Yeah, that's right, guys--
I shave.

00:32.133 --> 00:34.033
Spread the word.

00:36.537 --> 00:39.304
I took a shower
with the hose out front.

00:40.940 --> 00:44.076
Oh come on, like the neighbors
haven't seen that already.

00:48.648 --> 00:51.683
Um, what happened
to my chair?

00:52.318 --> 00:54.686
Ooh, um...

00:54.688 --> 00:56.021
Parker broke it
over Joey's back

00:56.023 --> 00:57.756
when they were wrestling.

00:57.758 --> 01:00.592
Correction,
he was wrestling.

01:00.594 --> 01:02.694
I was eating soup.

01:04.098 --> 01:07.933
You shouldn't have to stand
to eat your breakfast.

01:07.935 --> 01:09.101
Joey, get her a seat.

01:17.343 --> 01:19.611
Welcome home, Hollywood.

01:20.847 --> 01:22.848
<i>( Theme music plays )</i>

02:14.200 --> 02:16.301
12-minute mile, Maddie.
What happened?

02:16.303 --> 02:17.636
Oh, I ran two.

02:18.838 --> 02:21.273
Nice, Cassie.
Personal best.

02:21.275 --> 02:23.809
'cause I didn't want
to get a blister.

02:23.811 --> 02:25.344
But I ran this time
'cause I was being chased

02:25.346 --> 02:26.411
by a squirrel.

02:26.413 --> 02:29.715
Look at you--
stains.

02:29.717 --> 02:33.218
School bus ran through
a puddle and splashed me.

02:34.254 --> 02:36.288
Team meeting, everybody.
Grab some water.

02:36.290 --> 02:39.324
Hustle it up, willow.
Hustle up.

02:39.326 --> 02:41.059
( Gasping )

02:46.666 --> 02:49.034
( Sighs )

02:49.036 --> 02:51.703
My dogs have been barking
since sycamore street.

02:53.439 --> 02:55.407
Oh wait,
were you guys using this?

02:55.409 --> 02:57.309
Okay, don't forget.

02:57.311 --> 02:59.711
Team retreat--
my house, this weekend.

02:59.713 --> 03:01.747
Also, your votes are in.

03:01.749 --> 03:04.049
And the ridgewood high
fighting porcupines

03:04.051 --> 03:06.285
have themselves
a new team captain.

03:06.287 --> 03:08.353
( Cheers )

03:08.355 --> 03:11.056
She's the first sophomore
ever chosen.

03:11.058 --> 03:12.724
Maddie Rooney.

03:12.726 --> 03:14.326
( Cheering )

03:15.262 --> 03:19.865
And being named captain
of the team was huge for me.

03:19.867 --> 03:20.999
And I might have
played it cool

03:21.001 --> 03:22.000
in front of the girls
on the team,

03:22.002 --> 03:23.835
but I also
might have gone home

03:23.837 --> 03:25.237
and squealed in my closet.

03:25.239 --> 03:26.371
( Squeals )

03:26.373 --> 03:28.373
You're gonna be
a great captain, Maddie.

03:28.375 --> 03:31.743
Unless you're really bad
and the whole team turns
against you.

03:33.047 --> 03:35.314
Maddie got to be
really good friends

03:35.316 --> 03:37.449
with her basketball teammates.

03:37.451 --> 03:39.151
Sweet girls,
but they're all

03:39.153 --> 03:41.720
kind of like the "before"
in a makeover show.

03:42.989 --> 03:45.958
What? It means
they have potential.

03:45.960 --> 03:47.392
( Laughter )

03:51.431 --> 03:53.332
Principal fickman,
what are you doing?

03:53.334 --> 03:55.400
Is it Polly the porcupine's
birthday?

03:55.402 --> 03:57.336
It most certainly is not.

03:57.338 --> 03:59.371
Someone out there thinks
it's a big hee-haw

03:59.373 --> 04:01.340
to keep dressing up
the mascot.

04:01.342 --> 04:03.976
Well, I'm neither
hee-ing nor haw-ing.

04:03.978 --> 04:05.444
( Chuckles )

04:06.746 --> 04:09.248
It's a travesty, sir.

04:09.250 --> 04:11.250
I've been making budget cuts

04:11.252 --> 04:13.352
and girls' basketball
got hit hard.

04:13.354 --> 04:15.187
<i>The good news is</i>

04:15.189 --> 04:17.856
I got you the new uniforms
you requested.

04:17.858 --> 04:19.057
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

04:19.059 --> 04:20.425
The bad news is

04:20.427 --> 04:22.227
they're the boys'
old uniforms,

04:22.229 --> 04:23.295
sweaty and unlaundered.

04:25.798 --> 04:27.499
No, we need new uniforms.

04:27.501 --> 04:29.167
We're going to a tournament
in Chicago.

04:29.169 --> 04:31.470
Yeah, the Walter worciechowski
invitational.

04:31.472 --> 04:34.006
It took me three days
to learn how to say it.

04:34.008 --> 04:36.541
I'm only funding things
the student body cares about.

04:36.543 --> 04:38.810
People care about
girls' basketball.

04:38.812 --> 04:41.146
Oh... ( Wheezes )

04:41.148 --> 04:42.381
( Chuckles )

04:42.383 --> 04:43.515
Sure they do.

04:43.517 --> 04:46.451
And you keep
telling yourself that.

04:46.453 --> 04:49.454
Principal fickman,
we're not gonna let you
treat us this way.

04:49.456 --> 04:50.789
Right, team?!

04:53.526 --> 04:55.260
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I promised mother

04:55.262 --> 04:59.464
I'd be home in time for
"wheel of fortune!"

04:59.466 --> 05:00.565
- Principal fickman--
- yeah.

05:00.567 --> 05:02.000
Before you go,
( Snaps )

05:02.002 --> 05:07.839
Would you like a nice,
cold glass of water?

05:09.175 --> 05:11.176
- Well, I would.
Thank you.
- ( Quietly ) Yeah.

05:15.081 --> 05:17.149
- Refreshing.
- Yeah.

05:17.151 --> 05:19.885
( Giggles )

05:19.887 --> 05:21.987
Please tell me you still
have athlete's foot.

05:21.989 --> 05:23.255
- Raging.
- Good girl.

05:28.194 --> 05:29.861
Hey, Joey.

05:29.863 --> 05:31.830
( High-pitched scream )

05:31.832 --> 05:33.932
What are you doing
with a tarantula?

05:33.934 --> 05:35.300
Her name is Sylvia.

05:35.302 --> 05:36.968
And she's the class pet.

05:36.970 --> 05:38.303
I'm taking care of them
for the weekend.

05:38.305 --> 05:40.339
Them?

05:40.341 --> 05:42.240
Parker, I only see the one.

05:42.242 --> 05:46.011
Yeah, I already lost
the other five

05:46.013 --> 05:47.446
when I let them
out of their cage.

05:47.448 --> 05:48.947
What?!

05:48.949 --> 05:51.183
Oh, why would you let
them out of their cage?

05:51.185 --> 05:55.253
Duh-- to train them for
the all-tarantula circus.

05:56.222 --> 05:58.290
( High-pitched scream )

05:58.292 --> 06:00.325
All right, caught one.

06:00.327 --> 06:02.427
It's either Julie
the trapeze artist

06:02.429 --> 06:05.497
or Bernardo
the sword swallower.

06:07.300 --> 06:08.300
Four more to go.

06:08.302 --> 06:09.334
<i>( Car horn honks )</i>

06:09.336 --> 06:11.103
Oh, okay,
Parker, that is mom.

06:11.105 --> 06:13.071
And you cannot tell her
anything about this.

06:13.073 --> 06:14.439
Okay? If she finds out

06:14.441 --> 06:16.341
that there are a bunch
of spiders crawling around,

06:16.343 --> 06:17.376
she will freak out!

06:17.378 --> 06:19.044
Okay, act natural.

06:19.046 --> 06:21.179
Oh, hi, boys.

06:21.181 --> 06:24.483
<i>Listen, Maddie's</i>
<i>basketball team </i>

06:24.485 --> 06:25.550
<i>is gonna be here</i>
<i>all weekend.</i>

06:25.552 --> 06:26.918
Hey, hey, hey.
Eyes on me.

06:29.322 --> 06:32.124
So this weekend,
don't cause any trouble, okay?

06:32.126 --> 06:34.426
( Scoffs )
Trouble?

06:34.428 --> 06:36.628
Who do you think
you're talking to, lady?

06:37.663 --> 06:39.398
- Milady.
- <i>Mm-hmm. </i>

06:42.502 --> 06:44.236
No one on the team
had my back.

06:44.238 --> 06:45.370
It's just so--

06:45.372 --> 06:48.140
"frustrappointing."

06:48.142 --> 06:49.941
That's not a real word,

06:49.943 --> 06:52.377
yet somehow I know exactly
what it means.

06:52.379 --> 06:54.546
How do you do that?

06:54.548 --> 06:57.149
Oh, it's a gift.

06:57.151 --> 06:58.383
I don't know.

06:58.385 --> 07:00.452
Maybe I'm just not
cut out to be captain.

07:00.454 --> 07:02.120
I have no idea what to do.

07:02.122 --> 07:03.455
I do.

07:03.457 --> 07:06.458
( Snorts )
Please.

07:06.460 --> 07:09.027
You don't have a clue
about basketball.

07:09.029 --> 07:12.264
Maddie, this is
about leadership.

07:12.266 --> 07:14.299
On ¶ sing it loud...

07:16.035 --> 07:17.536
My cast was a team
and I led them through

07:17.538 --> 07:20.038
four critically-acclaimed
seasons of television.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.173
Want to know how I did it?

07:21.175 --> 07:22.374
No.

07:22.376 --> 07:25.577
Okay, there are
five steps to leadership.

07:25.579 --> 07:27.979
One, grab their attention.

07:27.981 --> 07:30.382
Two, get them
on the same page.

07:30.384 --> 07:32.651
Three, identify your goal.

07:32.653 --> 07:34.453
Four, lead them into battle.

07:34.455 --> 07:37.022
And five,
look great doing it.

07:37.024 --> 07:39.524
You know,
if I imagined those words

07:39.526 --> 07:41.493
not coming
out of your mouth,

07:41.495 --> 07:43.328
they actually
kind of make sense.

07:43.330 --> 07:44.629
Okay.

07:44.631 --> 07:48.300
Step one,
grab their attention.

07:48.302 --> 07:50.435
In Hollywood, they always say
the best way to do that

07:50.437 --> 07:52.671
is by firing someone
on your first day of work.

07:52.673 --> 07:55.073
( Snorts )
Liv, I'm not firing
any of my friends.

07:55.075 --> 07:57.075
( Melodramatic groan )

07:59.045 --> 08:01.246
Do I have to connect
all the dots for you?

08:01.248 --> 08:03.081
I will join the team.

08:03.083 --> 08:05.083
And you can fire me
for being terrible.

08:05.085 --> 08:06.651
<i>The team will know</i>
<i>you mean business </i>

08:06.653 --> 08:09.988
if you are ruthless enough
to crush your twin's fake dream.

08:09.990 --> 08:13.725
Liv, that's actually
kind of brilliant.

08:13.727 --> 08:15.760
And I do love the idea
of firing you.

08:18.731 --> 08:20.632
<i>( Whistle blows ) </i>

08:20.634 --> 08:23.134
Listen up,
lady porcupines.

08:23.136 --> 08:26.571
We have the tournament
in Chicago in three weeks.

08:26.573 --> 08:29.508
This retreat is about
coming together

08:29.510 --> 08:31.376
and becoming
a real team.

08:31.378 --> 08:34.412
Yeah, that means if a girl
puts herself out on the line--

08:34.414 --> 08:36.648
like, say, in front
of the principal--

08:38.651 --> 08:40.418
you better back her up.

08:40.420 --> 08:41.753
So to get us started,

08:41.755 --> 08:43.455
I got us all team bracelets.

08:44.557 --> 08:46.258
"Got your back."

08:46.260 --> 08:48.059
Cool.

08:48.061 --> 08:50.028
Mine broke.

08:50.030 --> 08:51.396
You know what?
It's okay.

08:51.398 --> 08:54.533
I had to buy like 500
to get the discount, so...

08:54.535 --> 08:56.268
How about some
passing drills?

08:56.270 --> 08:57.335
- Hold up, dad.
- <i>Yeah?</i>

08:57.337 --> 08:58.470
One more thing.

08:58.472 --> 08:59.404
We have a new teammate.

08:59.406 --> 09:02.407
Great.
Can she play center?

09:02.409 --> 09:04.776
We got no "d"
if willow goes down.

09:04.778 --> 09:07.112
Willow doesn't go down!

09:09.515 --> 09:13.218
Please, everybody, welcome
all the way from Hollywood,

09:13.220 --> 09:15.420
Liv Rooney.

09:17.757 --> 09:20.625
( Applause )

09:20.627 --> 09:22.327
Thank you.

09:22.329 --> 09:24.563
It is an honor

09:24.565 --> 09:26.731
to be nominated
in the same category

09:26.733 --> 09:29.267
as these other
very talented women.

09:29.269 --> 09:31.503
( Light clapping )

09:31.505 --> 09:33.338
Okay.

09:33.340 --> 09:35.106
Welcome aboard, Liv.

09:35.108 --> 09:36.341
( Whimpers )

09:38.311 --> 09:43.081
So, Hollywood big shot,
what position do you play?

09:43.083 --> 09:45.150
Oh. ( Giggles )

09:45.152 --> 09:46.318
I'm usually the lead.

09:48.854 --> 09:51.456
Great job, team.
Great job.

09:51.458 --> 09:53.158
Anybody need water?

09:55.328 --> 09:57.495
Dad, we seriously
need a new watercooler.

09:57.497 --> 09:59.230
Not in the budget.

09:59.232 --> 10:00.699
Got some juice boxes
the garage.

10:00.701 --> 10:02.467
Captain's in charge.

10:02.469 --> 10:03.735
Okay, everybody,

10:03.737 --> 10:04.736
let's start with some layups.

10:04.738 --> 10:06.104
Liv, you first.
Catch.

10:06.106 --> 10:09.474
No, sorry.
I'm not touching that ball.

10:09.476 --> 10:11.576
It's heavy and it's just...

10:11.578 --> 10:13.812
( Laughs )
It's such a boring color.

10:13.814 --> 10:17.616
Liv, being on this team
requires hard work.

10:17.618 --> 10:20.151
And if you're not
up for that,

10:20.153 --> 10:21.753
then maybe you're
not cut out for this.

10:21.755 --> 10:24.255
Wait, are you...

10:25.558 --> 10:27.559
Kicking me off the team?

10:30.529 --> 10:32.397
I'm devastated.

10:32.399 --> 10:33.898
Devastated.

10:33.900 --> 10:35.533
Liv, I'm the captain.

10:35.535 --> 10:36.601
<i>I've made my decision.</i>

10:36.603 --> 10:38.503
Go.

10:38.505 --> 10:42.674
Attention officially grabbed.
Step one, complete.

10:42.676 --> 10:44.843
I see.

10:44.845 --> 10:48.380
Don't cry for me,
lady porcupines.

10:51.417 --> 10:52.584
I'll be all right.

10:52.586 --> 10:55.687
Somehow.

10:57.189 --> 10:59.524
You can't kick
Liv off the team.

10:59.526 --> 11:01.359
- I can't?
- She can't?

11:01.361 --> 11:02.560
Willow's right.

11:02.562 --> 11:05.296
Liv is terrible,
but she'll learn.

11:05.298 --> 11:06.765
<i>We all had to.</i>

11:06.767 --> 11:08.533
She's our teammate now.

11:08.535 --> 11:11.302
And we have to
"back her up."

11:11.304 --> 11:12.704
Just like you said, man.

11:15.374 --> 11:17.542
I did say that, didn't I?

11:17.544 --> 11:19.177
Mm! Why did I say that?

11:22.448 --> 11:24.416
Okay.

11:24.418 --> 11:29.454
Liv, I guess you
are back on the team.

11:29.456 --> 11:31.189
( Strained ) Yay.

11:32.391 --> 11:36.761
Team: One, two, three,
go porcupines!

11:36.763 --> 11:38.663
Porcupines!

11:57.516 --> 12:01.419
Boys: ( Whispering )
¶ the itsy bitsy spider

12:01.421 --> 12:04.289
¶ went up the waterspout

12:04.291 --> 12:06.424
<i>¶ down came </i>

12:06.426 --> 12:08.293
¶ the rain...

12:08.295 --> 12:10.395
Crashing a girls' sleepover?

12:10.397 --> 12:12.464
Not cool, brahs.

12:12.466 --> 12:15.433
( Nervous chuckle )
Oh, she caught us.

12:15.435 --> 12:19.337
We were just trying
to cause mischief.

12:19.339 --> 12:21.473
Great, now I'm awake.

12:21.475 --> 12:22.540
I need a snack.

12:23.476 --> 12:25.376
Is it cool if we look
through your sleeping bag

12:25.378 --> 12:26.678
while you're gone?

12:26.680 --> 12:29.347
I don't know what
you're looking for,

12:29.349 --> 12:30.849
but I do know you
look stupid doing it.

12:33.786 --> 12:35.487
Liv, what are
you doing in here?

12:35.489 --> 12:37.555
Oh, I don't sleep in bags.

12:38.624 --> 12:40.592
<i>So listen,</i>

12:40.594 --> 12:41.993
I'm sorry my plan
kind of backfired

12:41.995 --> 12:43.561
and blew up
in our faces today.

12:43.563 --> 12:45.463
Liv, what are
you talking about?

12:45.465 --> 12:48.466
I mean, I know it didn't go
the way we thought it would,

12:48.468 --> 12:51.035
but when I saw the team
rally around you,

12:51.037 --> 12:53.505
I saw passion
for the first time.

12:53.507 --> 12:55.840
( Squeaks )
Faboosh.

12:55.842 --> 12:58.510
We are now officially
ready for step two.

12:58.512 --> 13:00.545
Remind me what
step two is again.

13:00.547 --> 13:01.946
Getting the team
on the same page.

13:01.948 --> 13:04.015
Perfect.
First thing in the morn--

13:04.017 --> 13:05.350
<i>tarantula!</i>

13:05.352 --> 13:09.988
( Girls screaming )

13:09.990 --> 13:12.390
Yes!

13:12.392 --> 13:13.725
Caught another one.

13:13.727 --> 13:15.927
Joan,
the troubled ringmaster

13:15.929 --> 13:17.695
from a broken home.

13:17.697 --> 13:19.063
Was it divorce?

13:19.065 --> 13:20.732
No, I literally
stepped on her home.

13:26.705 --> 13:27.972
Okay, guys.

13:27.974 --> 13:30.842
Guys, you call these
warm-ups?

13:30.844 --> 13:32.911
The first thing
any opposing team

13:32.913 --> 13:34.345
is gonna see from us

13:34.347 --> 13:36.381
is how we warm up, right?

13:36.383 --> 13:37.982
They need to know

13:37.984 --> 13:40.919
that we think as one,
play as one,

13:40.921 --> 13:43.054
and win as one.

13:43.056 --> 13:45.623
We'll still go to the bathroom
on our own though, right?

13:48.460 --> 13:50.728
( Bangs loudly )

13:50.730 --> 13:53.431
( Bangs three times )

13:53.433 --> 13:58.069
I want you all to reach
deep into your soul...

13:58.071 --> 14:00.605
And find your inner warrior.

14:01.674 --> 14:05.443
Who is she?
What makes her so fierce?

14:05.445 --> 14:08.580
What accessories can
we use to highlight...

14:08.582 --> 14:10.048
That fierceness?

14:11.450 --> 14:12.984
I have no clue
what she's saying,

14:12.986 --> 14:15.486
but I'm listening because
she seems confident

14:15.488 --> 14:17.622
and she carries
a big stick.

14:22.528 --> 14:23.928
Take a moment.

14:25.497 --> 14:26.998
Close your eyes.

14:33.072 --> 14:35.773
I thought we were just
gonna learn new warm-ups.

14:35.775 --> 14:38.610
It's a process.

14:41.680 --> 14:44.515
Aahh! Eww.

14:44.517 --> 14:47.118
Why are these dishes
all covered in cobwebs?

14:47.120 --> 14:49.487
( Chuckles )
That's a--

14:49.489 --> 14:50.755
that's so weird.

14:50.757 --> 14:54.759
Yeah, you wouldn't
expect tarantulas

14:54.761 --> 14:56.895
here in Wisconsin.

14:56.897 --> 14:58.396
( Sighs )

14:58.398 --> 14:59.430
I'm glad you guys
are here.

14:59.432 --> 15:01.165
You can help me
serve lunch.

15:01.167 --> 15:02.400
( Gasps )

15:02.402 --> 15:04.969
- It's beautiful.
- Whoa.

15:04.971 --> 15:07.739
I'm feeding athletes.

15:07.741 --> 15:09.841
I went big.
Here, help me take it outside.

15:09.843 --> 15:11.843
Parker, honey,
can you open the door?

15:11.845 --> 15:14.545
Come and get it!

15:14.547 --> 15:15.880
Now this is for the team,

15:15.882 --> 15:18.516
but don't worry.
You boys get leftovers.

15:19.585 --> 15:21.085
- Oh, oh, oh!
- <i>Lunch time!</i>

15:21.087 --> 15:22.553
<i>( Girls clamoring )</i>

15:22.555 --> 15:25.023
Please,
don't grab at it! Oh!

15:25.025 --> 15:26.424
At least let us
set it down!

15:26.426 --> 15:28.693
<i>( Shouting )</i>

15:33.666 --> 15:34.766
Oh.

15:35.834 --> 15:38.036
This was a two-day retreat.

15:39.471 --> 15:41.172
Yeah,

15:41.174 --> 15:42.640
and we've been working
on some new warm-ups

15:42.642 --> 15:43.675
that we want to show you.

15:43.677 --> 15:45.076
Ooh! Places.

15:45.078 --> 15:48.046
( Sighs )
Now remember,

15:48.048 --> 15:51.015
find your inner warrior.

15:51.017 --> 15:52.583
Five, six,
seven, eight.

15:52.585 --> 15:53.584
Huh!

15:53.586 --> 15:54.819
Huh!

15:54.821 --> 15:56.220
Huh! Huh! Huh!

15:56.222 --> 15:57.221
Huh!

15:57.223 --> 16:00.091
Huh! Huh!

16:00.093 --> 16:01.726
Huh!

16:01.728 --> 16:05.964
Huuuh!

16:07.466 --> 16:10.501
That was amazing.

16:10.503 --> 16:11.803
( Cheers )

16:11.805 --> 16:14.472
If fickman could see you now,

16:14.474 --> 16:17.241
he'd never say no.

16:17.243 --> 16:18.509
No.

16:19.778 --> 16:23.114
Now, if you'll
excuse me,

16:23.116 --> 16:24.716
I have to finish barbecuing

16:24.718 --> 16:27.251
these exquisite steaks
for the boys' team.

16:27.253 --> 16:30.621
They're having their
retreat inside.

16:30.623 --> 16:32.890
Unacceptable.

16:32.892 --> 16:35.660
We can't go
to the worciechowski tournament
in those uniforms you gave us.

16:35.662 --> 16:37.662
Oh, that is a problem.

16:38.564 --> 16:41.499
But I think
I have a solution.

16:41.501 --> 16:43.501
You're not going
to the tournament.

16:43.503 --> 16:44.969
What?!

16:44.971 --> 16:46.270
You can't do that.

16:46.272 --> 16:48.506
I think I just did.

16:53.846 --> 16:56.280
Okay, guys.
We were shut down
by fickman again.

16:56.282 --> 16:58.583
And that was a real
kick to the stomach.

16:58.585 --> 17:00.251
But if he's not gonna help us,
we're not gonna

17:00.253 --> 17:02.220
sit around and cry about it.
Am I right?

17:02.222 --> 17:04.222
<i>We're gonna help ourselves.</i>

17:04.224 --> 17:05.790
Stains, would you
come out here, please?

17:10.295 --> 17:13.831
This is what principal fickman
thinks we're worth.

17:13.833 --> 17:15.266
Are we gonna stand for this?

17:15.268 --> 17:17.235
Stains, catch.

17:20.139 --> 17:23.041
This is madness!

17:25.277 --> 17:27.912
I bet the boys don't worry
about their pants falling off.

17:27.914 --> 17:30.581
Are we gonna take this
sitting down?

17:30.583 --> 17:32.150
Willow doesn't go down!

17:32.152 --> 17:33.885
- ( Grunts )
- ( Grunts )

17:33.887 --> 17:35.019
( Bangs )

17:35.021 --> 17:37.555
Attention, lady groundhogs.

17:37.557 --> 17:39.290
Um, we're the porcupines.

17:39.292 --> 17:40.825
Whatever.

17:42.261 --> 17:43.327
Cue music.

17:43.329 --> 17:46.697
<i>( Dance music plays )</i>

17:46.699 --> 17:50.134
<i>Behold your future uniforms.</i>

17:50.136 --> 17:52.570
This sporty sport short
looks great on the court

17:52.572 --> 17:54.205
or just sitting on the bench.

17:54.207 --> 17:55.640
That's me.

17:55.642 --> 17:57.308
I sit the bench.

17:57.310 --> 17:59.343
I'm gonna look great.

17:59.345 --> 18:01.579
( Clears throat )

18:01.581 --> 18:04.082
The b-ball tank is perfect
for all that dribbily, drabbily,

18:04.084 --> 18:05.316
shooty stuff
you girls love to do.

18:06.251 --> 18:08.586
Dunk-tastic, am I right?

18:08.588 --> 18:10.755
I want to get
married in that.

18:12.291 --> 18:13.958
We need those uniforms.

18:13.960 --> 18:16.160
We can't let fickman
ruin willow's wedding.

18:17.696 --> 18:19.964
And we have our common goal.

18:19.966 --> 18:22.033
Step three achieved.

18:22.035 --> 18:24.202
We're all ears,
captain.

18:24.204 --> 18:25.636
How do we get 'em?

18:25.638 --> 18:27.738
This is how.

18:27.740 --> 18:29.807
We're gonna raise money
for those uniforms

18:29.809 --> 18:31.709
by selling these bracelets
to the kids

18:31.711 --> 18:33.377
at school
who do support us.

18:33.379 --> 18:34.278
Are you with me?!

18:34.280 --> 18:35.379
All: Yeah!

18:35.381 --> 18:36.848
Are we gonna tell
principal fickman

18:36.850 --> 18:38.082
he can't push us around?

18:38.084 --> 18:41.619
Does everyone want stains
to pull up her pants?

18:41.621 --> 18:42.920
Yeah!

18:47.326 --> 18:49.160
Parker,
what are you doing? Stop.

18:49.162 --> 18:50.962
Eating a cricket.

18:50.964 --> 18:52.230
To catch a tarantula,

18:52.232 --> 18:54.098
you have to eat
like a tarantula.

18:54.100 --> 18:57.001
Okay, and where
did you hear that?

18:57.003 --> 18:58.302
Oh, the man in my head.

18:58.304 --> 19:00.972
He comes up with
all kinds of cool things.

19:00.974 --> 19:03.674
Oh, okay, yeah.
No, please, carry on.

19:03.676 --> 19:05.643
Stop!
Put the bug down.

19:05.645 --> 19:07.778
What's going on?

19:07.780 --> 19:10.314
Okay, fine.
I'm tired of the lies. I--

19:10.316 --> 19:12.416
I brought home
tarantulas from school,

19:12.418 --> 19:14.352
and they kind of
sort of got out.

19:14.354 --> 19:17.054
There are gross,
hairy tarantulas

19:17.056 --> 19:18.689
crawling around
our house somewhere?

19:18.691 --> 19:20.291
Find them.
Now.

19:20.293 --> 19:23.060
( Chuckles ) I know this
is completely in my head,

19:23.062 --> 19:24.695
but I feel like
I can feel them

19:24.697 --> 19:26.397
crawling all over me.

19:27.332 --> 19:29.033
Mom--

19:29.035 --> 19:30.368
what is it?

19:30.370 --> 19:33.437
Just-- we love you.

19:33.439 --> 19:36.440
Aww.
I love you guys too.

19:36.442 --> 19:37.808
( Blows kiss )

19:46.018 --> 19:47.451
Joke's on you, students.

19:47.453 --> 19:49.887
Mother's going to love this.

19:51.690 --> 19:52.723
Principal fickman--

19:52.725 --> 19:55.193
too late.
I've got dibs.

19:55.195 --> 19:57.828
Okay.

19:57.830 --> 20:00.064
The girls' basketball team
decided that we weren't gonna

20:00.066 --> 20:01.265
wait for you
to come through for us,

20:01.267 --> 20:03.301
so we took matters
into our own hands.

20:03.303 --> 20:05.436
Are you with me
ridgewood high?

20:05.438 --> 20:06.737
Crowd: Yeah!

20:06.739 --> 20:08.406
Okay, what's going on?

20:08.408 --> 20:10.474
You're about to see
steps four and five--

20:10.476 --> 20:12.977
marching into battle
and looking good doing it.

20:12.979 --> 20:14.812

20:40.807 --> 20:42.273
but we don't
need these anymore.

20:43.742 --> 20:45.142
You said money only
goes to the things

cares about.

20:46.479 --> 20:48.079
Well, look around.

20:49.314 --> 20:50.748
I said look!

20:52.185 --> 20:55.286
She meant look, please.

I hate to say it,
but I have a new respect
for you girls.

21:01.261 --> 21:02.760
( Chuckles )

21:02.762 --> 21:05.396
Really hate to say it.

21:05.398 --> 21:08.232
Are you gonna send us to
the worciechowski tournament?

21:10.168 --> 21:12.236
I can find room
in the budget for that.

21:12.238 --> 21:15.406
( All cheering )

21:15.408 --> 21:18.542
and tell them I'm just
gonna print

21:18.544 --> 21:20.411
last year's edition again.

21:20.413 --> 21:23.881
Sorry, ninth graders,
you lose.

21:25.250 --> 21:27.118
( Laughs )

21:27.120 --> 21:29.954
Wait, I'm a ninth grader.

21:29.956 --> 21:31.989
That was the best picture
I've ever taken.

21:31.991 --> 21:33.124
Wait, please, stop, no!

21:34.826 --> 21:36.327
Nice work.

21:36.329 --> 21:38.129
My porcupine quills
feel a little sharper

21:38.131 --> 21:39.297
because of you,
captain.

21:39.299 --> 21:40.831
( Grunts )

21:42.000 --> 21:43.567
We really have
to thank Liv.

21:45.037 --> 21:46.937
I can't believe
I'm saying this,

21:46.939 --> 21:50.308
but you are the best teammate
I've ever had.

21:50.310 --> 21:52.410
I mean, I never could have
rallied the team without you.

21:52.412 --> 21:54.478
Maddie, that's so sweet.

21:55.447 --> 21:57.448
We both know
I'm quitting though, right?

21:57.450 --> 21:59.817
I already cleaned out
your fake locker.

22:03.155 --> 22:05.523
All right, fighting porcupines,
let's bounce.

22:29.448 --> 22:31.182
Hey, Joey.

22:31.184 --> 22:33.284
It was fun hanging
at your place this weekend.

22:33.286 --> 22:35.920
That's a cool sandwich
you're eating.

22:38.023 --> 22:41.525
I am not eating a sandwich.

22:41.527 --> 22:43.994
I know, but when I practiced
this moment at home,

22:43.996 --> 22:47.331
I imagined it
going down at lunch.

22:47.333 --> 22:50.067
Okay, uh, so...

22:50.069 --> 22:53.504
What is happening?

22:55.207 --> 22:57.408
I heart you.

22:57.410 --> 23:00.311
Do you now?

23:00.313 --> 23:02.913
Do you heart me back?

23:02.915 --> 23:05.182
Not quite sure
what to say.

23:05.184 --> 23:07.918
I didn't hear a no.

23:07.920 --> 23:10.087
This man is my property!

23:10.089 --> 23:11.622
I own Joey Rooney!

23:11.624 --> 23:15.493
And I will crush anyone
I catch looking at him!

23:15.495 --> 23:17.561
Does that make you feel
protected and secure?

23:20.198 --> 23:22.366
Oddly, yes.
Yes, it does.

23:22.368 --> 23:25.136
Good-bye, my little man.

23:25.138 --> 23:27.238
- ( Blows kiss )
- ( Nervous chuckle )
