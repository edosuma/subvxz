00:01.002 --> 00:02.712
<i>Previously on</i> Homeland...

00:02.796 --> 00:04.506
Were you delivering the money
on your own behalf?

00:04.589 --> 00:06.216
Let's talk about immunity.

00:06.299 --> 00:08.218
She gonna tell us
who sent her there?

00:08.301 --> 00:10.095
A senior White House official.

00:10.178 --> 00:12.555
We have a witness appearing
for us in two days

00:12.639 --> 00:15.058
who will implicate
your chief of staff

00:15.141 --> 00:16.559
in the general's death.

00:16.643 --> 00:17.894
Let me talk to the Russians.

00:17.977 --> 00:20.146
Tell them in terms
they understand.

00:20.230 --> 00:22.399
- No more.
- What happened?

00:22.482 --> 00:24.567
I left Franny at Maggie's
for the time being.

00:24.651 --> 00:27.362
Go back to your sister's house.
Whatever you did, undo it.

00:27.445 --> 00:29.239
I've been running around
like a madman.

00:29.322 --> 00:32.409
I can't keep inflicting that
on Franny. I can't.

00:39.499 --> 00:42.293
We are running out of time.
You have to be honest now.

00:42.377 --> 00:45.797
- I want my lawyer.
- Let's give him one.

00:45.880 --> 00:48.466
I drew up a motion demanding
your immediate release.

00:56.808 --> 00:59.227
- Dante!
- Poison.

00:59.310 --> 01:01.020
Like McClendon.

01:01.104 --> 01:03.022
- Did we get what we need?
- He said McClendon

01:03.106 --> 01:05.942
was poisoned by Russians.
He named Simone.

01:06.025 --> 01:08.486
We have a warrant for
Simone Martin's arrest.

01:08.570 --> 01:11.322
Saul, we've reached out to
the Russians ourselves.

01:11.406 --> 01:13.783
You just put a target
on her back.

01:13.867 --> 01:16.327
They got to her.

01:16.411 --> 01:18.163
Now Dante's all we've got.

01:18.246 --> 01:22.375
I'm gonna have to get back
to you. His heart stopped.

01:27.088 --> 01:28.840
Oh.

01:42.437 --> 01:44.898
<i>He saved our lives.</i>

01:44.981 --> 01:46.441
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:46.524 --> 01:50.862
<i>What was his name?</i>

01:50.945 --> 01:54.616
<i>Carrie, you're not yourself.</i>

01:54.699 --> 01:57.118
<i>But you don't have
my condition.</i>

01:57.202 --> 01:59.537
<i>I'm dealing with it.
I-I've been dealing with it</i>

01:59.621 --> 02:01.122
<i>since I was 22.</i>

02:02.791 --> 02:06.419
<i>She said no one at work
could know. She's bipolar.</i>

02:06.503 --> 02:09.047
<i>The mood of the country,
it's not great.</i>

02:10.298 --> 02:12.967
<i>Civil... war.</i>

02:13.051 --> 02:15.178
<i>Madam President, please!</i>

02:15.261 --> 02:18.097
<i>You have to put a stop to this!</i>

02:18.181 --> 02:20.350
<i>It's only getting worse.</i>

02:20.433 --> 02:23.394
<i>Is there no fucking line?</i>

02:23.478 --> 02:26.564
<i>Ridiculous lies
and accusations.</i>

02:29.484 --> 02:32.779
<i>The White House
is in crisis mode.</i>

02:32.862 --> 02:36.741
<i>I'm talking
about information warfare.</i>

02:36.825 --> 02:39.786
<i>Our country is under attack.</i>

02:41.246 --> 02:44.666
<i>The time to rise up is now!</i>

02:46.292 --> 02:49.587
<i>I swore an oath to protect it.</i>

02:51.881 --> 02:53.883
<i>Just think of me
as a light on the heavens,</i>

02:53.967 --> 02:59.597
<i>a beacon, steering you clear
of the wrongs.</i>

03:15.947 --> 03:18.491
- Sim?
- Hmm?

03:20.952 --> 03:23.162
Simi?

03:25.415 --> 03:28.126
Are we there?

03:28.209 --> 03:30.461
Almost.

03:30.545 --> 03:33.339
How long have
I been out?

03:33.423 --> 03:35.383
About an hour.

03:39.387 --> 03:41.139
You should have woken me.

03:43.182 --> 03:45.268
I like watching you sleep.

03:45.351 --> 03:47.103
No tails?

03:47.186 --> 03:49.522
Nah, nothing.

03:49.606 --> 03:53.359
What happens
when we get there?

03:53.443 --> 03:56.571
I will put you in
the bed and, uh,

03:56.654 --> 03:59.407
we won't get out
for a month.

04:01.117 --> 04:04.829
My uncle-- he's got a place
near Sergiyev Posad.

04:04.913 --> 04:06.831
We used to go there
in summers.

04:06.915 --> 04:10.126
It's got woods.

04:10.209 --> 04:11.586
It's beautiful.

04:11.669 --> 04:15.131
So when they finish
debriefing you,

04:15.214 --> 04:16.966
we'll go there.

04:38.488 --> 04:40.365
- Yeah?
<i>- Have you had</i>

04:40.448 --> 04:43.701
<i>any contact with your FBI guy
in the last day or two?</i>

04:43.785 --> 04:45.578
- No, why?
<i>- How about Simone?</i>

04:45.662 --> 04:47.830
Simone, have you heard
from Dante lately?

04:47.914 --> 04:49.749
- No.
- No, she hasn't.

04:49.832 --> 04:51.584
- Why? What's going on?
<i>- Dante hasn't shown up</i>

04:51.668 --> 04:54.003
<i>for work, and his phone
goes straight to voicemail.</i>

04:54.087 --> 04:56.255
<i>I had his super ring
his doorbell a few times,</i>

04:56.339 --> 04:58.883
<i>and no answer.
I'm on my way there now.</i>

04:58.967 --> 05:00.551
I'll call you back.

05:04.597 --> 05:06.933
That was Clayton.
Dante's missing.

05:07.016 --> 05:09.477
He hasn't checked in
in a couple of days.

05:09.560 --> 05:13.272
Strange. Maybe I missed
a message.

05:13.356 --> 05:16.234
No. Nothing.

05:16.317 --> 05:20.071
Has he done anything like this
before? Just disappeared?

05:20.154 --> 05:21.614
Never.

05:21.698 --> 05:23.616
Cold feet?

05:23.700 --> 05:27.370
He's already done
the difficult part.

05:27.453 --> 05:28.746
It doesn't make sense.

05:28.830 --> 05:31.124
Where is he then?

05:31.207 --> 05:33.543
I don't know.

05:36.129 --> 05:38.297
I can't go, then.

05:40.800 --> 05:42.427
What are you talking about?

05:42.510 --> 05:44.178
This can put the whole
operation at risk.

05:44.262 --> 05:45.763
That's absurd.

05:45.847 --> 05:47.890
The president will be blamed
for my disappearance,

05:47.974 --> 05:50.143
just as she was blamed
for the death of McClendon.

05:50.226 --> 05:53.187
You've won.
She's on her last legs.

05:53.271 --> 05:55.314
Not if Dante
turned himself in.

05:55.398 --> 05:57.692
If he's cooperating with
the authorities, then...

05:57.775 --> 05:59.110
- No, he's not.
- You don't know that.

05:59.193 --> 06:02.613
- I know him.
- I hope you're right.

06:02.697 --> 06:06.409
It's no safer for you here
than it is for me.

06:10.246 --> 06:13.041
- I'll be careful.
- Don't give me that shit!

06:13.124 --> 06:14.751
You've been reckless
and you know it!

06:14.834 --> 06:16.502
Coming to get me
was reckless.

06:16.586 --> 06:18.463
Fine. Next time,
I'll leave you there.

06:18.546 --> 06:20.631
You think this is a joke?

06:20.715 --> 06:25.094
Leave it to Clayton.
That is why he is here.

06:25.178 --> 06:27.096
I can't!

06:31.434 --> 06:32.935
I can't.

06:34.896 --> 06:37.899
Then I must plan
to never see you again.

06:39.525 --> 06:40.985
Simone.

06:41.986 --> 06:43.946
Simone.

07:34.747 --> 07:37.708
Got anything?

07:37.792 --> 07:40.628
No. They wanna put
a balloon pump in,

07:40.711 --> 07:43.256
but at this point,
he's not strong enough

07:43.339 --> 07:45.174
to survive the procedure.

07:45.258 --> 07:48.678
- How's his cognitive function?
- They did a CAT scan.

07:48.761 --> 07:51.556
There's no structural damage
to his brain, but...

07:51.639 --> 07:55.852
we won't really know anything
until he wakes up.

07:55.935 --> 07:59.021
They give you any sense
of when that might happen?

07:59.105 --> 08:01.774
No.

08:04.610 --> 08:06.404
But he is gonna wake up?

08:06.487 --> 08:09.115
The doctor thinks so.

08:09.198 --> 08:11.284
He better.

08:12.702 --> 08:15.246
Anything on Simone?

08:19.167 --> 08:21.294
We got teams out, but...

08:23.963 --> 08:25.756
Is there any other way
to connect the Russians

08:25.840 --> 08:27.884
to McClendon or Lucasville,
any of it?

08:27.967 --> 08:31.137
Without Dante? No.

08:32.972 --> 08:34.974
You realize he may deny
he said anything.

08:35.057 --> 08:37.351
He may not even
remember he said it.

08:40.646 --> 08:43.065
I have to get
to the White House,

08:43.149 --> 08:44.859
brief the president.

08:47.028 --> 08:50.406
- When he comes to...
- You'll be the first to know.

09:02.293 --> 09:04.754
Senator, why was tomorrow's
hearing canceled?

09:04.837 --> 09:08.174
Hopefully, it's just postponed.
We're not sure at the moment.

09:08.257 --> 09:09.467
Has the witness
chosen not to testify?

09:09.550 --> 09:11.636
She was ready and willing
to testify.

09:11.719 --> 09:13.888
Unfortunately, we no longer
know where she is.

09:15.473 --> 09:18.768
<i>All I can tell you
is that Ms. Martin was</i>

09:18.851 --> 09:21.771
<i>under Federal protection
in an undisclosed location</i>

09:21.854 --> 09:23.940
<i>known only to
the U.S. Marshal Service,</i>

09:24.023 --> 09:26.067
<i>and now she's gone.</i>

09:26.150 --> 09:28.653
<i>- Are you saying
she was kidnapped?
- I don't know what to say.</i>

09:28.736 --> 09:31.322
<i>Frankly, the whole thing
is deeply troubling.</i>

09:31.405 --> 09:32.990
<i>Do you believe
the White House had a hand</i>

09:33.074 --> 09:35.910
<i>- in her disappearance?
- The sheer volume of links</i>

09:35.993 --> 09:38.371
<i>between these
very disturbing events</i>

09:38.454 --> 09:42.541
<i>and this administration
has become simply overwhelming.</i>

09:42.625 --> 09:44.585
<i>Sir,
is impeachment on the table?</i>

09:44.669 --> 09:46.754
<i>That's up to my colleagues
in the House.</i>

09:46.837 --> 09:48.506
<i>But with the kind of behavior</i>

09:48.589 --> 09:50.299
<i>we're seeing
from this president...</i>

09:50.383 --> 09:52.635
- That's enough.
<i>- it's tough to imagine
we're not headed</i>

09:52.718 --> 09:54.011
<i>in that direction.</i>

09:54.095 --> 09:55.721
Anything?

09:55.805 --> 09:57.640
Keeping a close eye on
the airports and the borders,

09:57.723 --> 10:00.559
but likelihood is
Simone's already dead.

10:02.561 --> 10:04.313
How did they find her?

10:04.397 --> 10:06.732
What about the FBI agent?

10:06.816 --> 10:09.652
I mean, he can still testify
this was a Russian operation.

10:09.735 --> 10:11.696
We were hoping that would
be the case, but, uh,

10:11.779 --> 10:13.572
that's been problematic.

10:13.656 --> 10:16.409
- Fucking hell.
- All right.

10:17.827 --> 10:19.870
How much of the evidence
holds up on paper?

10:19.954 --> 10:22.790
Not enough. Not yet.

10:22.873 --> 10:24.792
But we can still make
a connection between

10:24.875 --> 10:27.712
the Russians and the fake
Lucasville story, right?

10:27.795 --> 10:30.047
Paley's suggesting
you disappeared a witness

10:30.131 --> 10:31.841
from Federal Protection.

10:31.924 --> 10:34.218
That's the starter pistol
on impeachment.

10:34.302 --> 10:37.847
We can't come back at him with
a story about hostile tweets.

10:37.930 --> 10:40.224
I think you may need
to read him in.

10:40.308 --> 10:42.643
Who? Paley?

10:42.727 --> 10:43.894
On what?

10:43.978 --> 10:46.355
Everything.

10:46.439 --> 10:49.108
Lay it out. Tonight even.

10:49.191 --> 10:50.776
Maybe he'll tone down
the rhetoric,

10:50.860 --> 10:52.737
give us some time
to stem the bleeding.

10:52.820 --> 10:54.697
It's painful, I know.

10:54.780 --> 10:56.282
- It's suicidal.
- She's right.

10:56.365 --> 10:59.368
There's no telling what he'd do
with that kind of ammunition.

10:59.452 --> 11:04.081
He's a 20-year veteran
of the United States Senate.

11:04.165 --> 11:06.292
I've testified before him,
briefed him.

11:06.375 --> 11:09.712
He asks smart questions,
has his eye on the ball.

11:09.795 --> 11:14.383
He may be a grasping partisan,
but...

11:14.467 --> 11:17.053
he's also a patriot.

12:04.433 --> 12:06.769
Have you found him?

12:06.852 --> 12:09.105
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- Where is he?

12:09.188 --> 12:12.483
<i>A hospital in Bethesda.
Regent Medical Center.</i>

12:12.566 --> 12:15.611
- So he is sick?
<i>- Not exactly.
I'm just leaving his apartment.</i>

12:15.694 --> 12:18.030
<i>Apparently, he was
arrested last night.</i>

12:18.114 --> 12:19.490
Arrested?

12:19.573 --> 12:22.410
<i>Neighbors saw him being
dragged naked into a cruiser.</i>

12:24.787 --> 12:28.082
So... I don't understand.
Why is he in the hospital?

12:28.165 --> 12:30.292
<i>I don't know.
I'm on my way there now.</i>

12:30.376 --> 12:32.711
<i>I just texted you the location.</i>

12:35.005 --> 12:37.550
- I'll be there in a few hours.
<i>- You got it.</i>

13:15.588 --> 13:17.339
Hey.

13:17.423 --> 13:18.924
How you feelin'?

13:21.635 --> 13:23.262
Thirsty.

13:24.472 --> 13:26.390
Here.

13:37.610 --> 13:39.653
The doctor says there's
some damage to your heart,

13:39.737 --> 13:41.822
but nothing that's
not fixable.

13:41.906 --> 13:44.033
We're trying to find
the guy, the lawyer,

13:44.116 --> 13:46.202
but so far he's...

13:46.285 --> 13:48.287
he's gone.

13:50.247 --> 13:54.293
Is he somebody
you'd seen before?

13:54.376 --> 13:58.422
Do-do you remember a lawyer
coming in yesterday?

14:00.466 --> 14:02.426
- Yeah.
- Okay, I'm sorry.

14:02.510 --> 14:05.971
I-I didn't know how much
of that was still clear.

14:06.055 --> 14:07.765
Did he say anything

14:07.848 --> 14:10.351
that might help us
track him down?

14:14.355 --> 14:16.023
Are you still
protecting them?

14:18.359 --> 14:21.445
Jesus Christ.
Are you serious?

14:21.529 --> 14:23.614
You-you already told us.

14:23.697 --> 14:28.244
Simone, McClendon... Are-are
we still playing this game?

14:28.327 --> 14:30.204
I was having a heart attack.

14:33.499 --> 14:36.210
Those people tried
to kill you.

14:36.293 --> 14:37.795
The doctors didn't think
you were gonna make it.

14:37.878 --> 14:41.715
They wanted me to track down
your parents. I...

14:41.799 --> 14:43.801
I've been trying to figure out
how I was gonna tell your mother

14:43.884 --> 14:45.886
you were poisoned
by Russians.

14:45.970 --> 14:48.222
And that's
who you're loyal to?

14:48.305 --> 14:51.141
People who would
do this to you?

14:54.603 --> 14:57.731
You think
they're gonna stop now?

14:59.900 --> 15:03.445
We can protect you.

15:03.529 --> 15:04.822
Right.

15:04.905 --> 15:07.157
We can.

15:07.241 --> 15:09.243
But you won't.

15:09.326 --> 15:13.038
Simone is gone. They got to her
and they probably killed her,

15:13.122 --> 15:15.332
just like they tried
to kill you.

15:15.416 --> 15:18.252
So, yeah, a few days ago,
you didn't mean much,

15:18.335 --> 15:20.879
and we were not inclined
to protect you.

15:20.963 --> 15:22.798
But now...

15:22.881 --> 15:25.926
if you help us, I will.

15:26.010 --> 15:28.470
I will do everything
in my power.

15:28.554 --> 15:31.473
I will use all of my influence
with Saul Berenson

15:31.557 --> 15:33.225
to see you don't spend
the rest of your life

15:33.309 --> 15:35.728
in a federal prison.

15:47.281 --> 15:51.076
You have an idea...

15:51.160 --> 15:53.203
of who I am

15:53.287 --> 15:56.373
and what I did...

15:56.457 --> 16:00.044
and it's nothing like that.

16:03.589 --> 16:06.133
I believe you.

16:06.216 --> 16:07.885
I really do.

16:17.728 --> 16:20.898
Who was running you?
Was it Simone?

16:20.981 --> 16:23.984
Or Yevgeny himself?

16:31.492 --> 16:33.952
He's awake and he's
gonna cooperate.

16:34.036 --> 16:36.121
- Is he coherent?
<i>- Completely.</i>

16:36.205 --> 16:38.248
<i>He won't be the friendliest
witness in the world,</i>

16:38.332 --> 16:40.000
but he'll confirm he was
a Russian asset.

16:40.084 --> 16:42.086
And he'll confirm Simone
is an operative.

16:42.169 --> 16:44.088
Thank God.
He give you anybody else?

16:44.171 --> 16:46.632
<i>He says they maintained
a pretty tight cell structure.</i>

16:46.715 --> 16:48.425
He didn't deal with anyone
but Simone.

16:48.509 --> 16:50.302
- I suppose it's possible.
<i>- Saul...</i>

16:50.386 --> 16:54.682
he told me there's
a burn code for emergencies,

16:54.765 --> 16:55.974
delivered as a tweet.

16:56.058 --> 16:57.559
And when you get it,
you don't just go to ground,

16:57.643 --> 16:59.395
you torch your entire part
of the operation.

16:59.478 --> 17:01.647
<i>Okay.</i>

17:03.399 --> 17:05.442
It's one code for
the whole network.

17:05.526 --> 17:08.612
Doesn't seem
particularly secure.

17:08.696 --> 17:10.948
- Why would Yevgeny do that?
<i>- It's a ripcord</i>

17:11.031 --> 17:12.783
if they need
to go down fast.

17:12.866 --> 17:15.786
And, Saul,
there's a response code.

17:15.869 --> 17:17.830
<i>You reply
to confirm you're out.</i>

17:17.913 --> 17:19.331
Did he give you the code?

17:19.415 --> 17:21.166
He did.

17:21.250 --> 17:22.960
You think we can launch it?

17:23.043 --> 17:24.670
I don't know. You tell me.

17:24.753 --> 17:26.797
It means breaking into
the Twitter server,

17:26.880 --> 17:28.382
which may or may not
be feasible.

17:28.465 --> 17:30.259
Never mind
the legal issues.

17:30.342 --> 17:32.094
I'll look into that end.

17:32.177 --> 17:35.389
Talk to Clint and Max, see if
they can make it happen.

17:35.472 --> 17:36.765
If we can launch this thing,

17:36.849 --> 17:39.059
get a bunch of his operatives
to countersign...

17:39.143 --> 17:41.520
It collapses
his entire operation.

17:41.603 --> 17:44.648
Potentially I.D.'s
everyone in the network.

17:44.732 --> 17:48.652
Carrie, I don't know
what to say. It's, uh...

17:48.736 --> 17:51.321
I'll, uh,
I'll call you back.

17:51.405 --> 17:55.325
Unbelievable.

18:43.916 --> 18:45.918
Senator Paley's here.

18:46.001 --> 18:48.879
They're putting him in
the Situation Room now.

18:48.962 --> 18:50.672
- Shall we?
- Have him sit for a minute.

18:50.756 --> 18:52.382
There's something else
we need to talk about.

18:52.466 --> 18:55.385
- What's that?
- Well, there'll be some
jockeying

18:55.469 --> 18:58.263
for immunity and protection,
but our witness, Dante Allen,

18:58.347 --> 19:01.099
has just agreed to cooperate.

19:01.183 --> 19:03.060
- On the record?
- He also provided us

19:03.143 --> 19:05.020
intel that might allow us
to make a move

19:05.103 --> 19:07.689
on Yevgeny Gromov's network
here in the United States.

19:07.773 --> 19:11.151
A cyber attack that will
disable his capabilities.

19:11.235 --> 19:14.404
Probably identify a number
of his agents on the ground.

19:14.488 --> 19:18.242
- What's the catch?
- It'll require
some NSA intervention

19:18.325 --> 19:20.244
and an American
media company.

19:20.327 --> 19:22.621
Probably best undertaken
without their knowledge.

19:22.704 --> 19:27.543
- Say what you mean, Saul.
- Electronic breaking
and entering on U.S. citizens.

19:27.626 --> 19:29.461
If you consider us
under attack,

19:29.545 --> 19:31.713
you're at liberty
to authorize it.

19:31.797 --> 19:34.299
- But?
- But if it ever leaks,

19:34.383 --> 19:35.717
you look like you're
playing fast and loose

19:35.801 --> 19:37.469
with the Constitution.

19:40.389 --> 19:42.057
You notice the longer
this goes on,

19:42.140 --> 19:47.104
the more I become the leader
my enemies say that I am.

19:50.190 --> 19:52.776
Draft a finding
for me to sign.

19:57.698 --> 20:00.117
Saul?
Let's do our best

20:00.200 --> 20:02.953
to keep the club
on this one very small.

20:03.036 --> 20:04.746
Yes, ma'am.

20:27.519 --> 20:30.856
Sam. Thanks for coming in.

20:30.939 --> 20:32.357
This couldn't wait
till morning?

20:32.441 --> 20:34.735
We didn't think it should.

20:34.818 --> 20:37.446
She joining us?

20:37.529 --> 20:39.948
She isn't.

20:48.415 --> 20:51.418
Senator.

20:51.501 --> 20:53.545
Saul.

20:53.629 --> 20:55.672
Here you go.

20:57.716 --> 20:59.718
Please.

21:23.033 --> 21:24.993
Your witness, Simone Martin,

21:25.077 --> 21:27.412
the woman you're accusing us
of disappearing,

21:27.496 --> 21:29.414
is a Russian intelligence
officer.

21:29.498 --> 21:31.667
- What?
- I'm afraid so.

21:33.335 --> 21:36.380
She's attached to an operational
division inside the GRU

21:36.463 --> 21:37.965
known as Directorate Six.

21:38.048 --> 21:40.384
After the election,
she was posted to Washington

21:40.467 --> 21:44.888
to rekindle a prior relationship
with Mr. Wellington.

21:44.972 --> 21:47.349
- The Russians?
- Yes, sir.

21:47.432 --> 21:49.226
Yeah, give me
a fucking break.

21:49.309 --> 21:52.521
Believe me, I had
a great deal of difficulty

21:52.604 --> 21:54.898
accepting it myself.

21:54.982 --> 21:56.650
We've uncovered

21:56.733 --> 21:58.735
compelling evidence
that ties Ms. Martin

21:58.819 --> 22:00.696
to the poisoning death
of General McClendon.

22:00.779 --> 22:02.906
Plan was for her to testify
in front of your committee

22:02.990 --> 22:06.201
that she'd done so
on behalf of Mr. Wellington

22:06.284 --> 22:08.370
and the president.

22:08.453 --> 22:11.415
If your evidence was
so compelling,

22:11.498 --> 22:14.209
why'd you go to the trouble
of gettin' rid of her?

22:14.292 --> 22:16.670
We didn't get rid of her.
The GRU did.

22:16.753 --> 22:20.382
This is nonsense.
Come on, David.

22:20.465 --> 22:23.885
As Hail Marys goes, this is
elaborate, even for you.

22:23.969 --> 22:26.680
I wish it weren't true.

22:26.763 --> 22:28.223
Well, it isn't.

22:28.306 --> 22:30.559
If you could prove it,

22:30.642 --> 22:34.229
we wouldn't be huddled in here,
just us chickens.

22:37.190 --> 22:38.608
You know this man?

22:38.692 --> 22:40.402
Yeah, Dante Allen.

22:40.485 --> 22:41.820
He's, uh, FBI.

22:41.903 --> 22:43.989
Had a good deal of interaction
with him, haven't you?

22:44.072 --> 22:45.490
- Some.
- In fact, he's the one

22:45.574 --> 22:48.368
who brought Ms. Martin
to your attention, wasn't he?

22:48.452 --> 22:51.955
- So?
- Go on. Connect the dots.

22:55.042 --> 22:56.877
For Christ's sake.

22:56.960 --> 22:59.838
You gonna tell me Castro
was in on this, too?

22:59.921 --> 23:02.591
Mr. Allen is
in federal custody, Senator,

23:02.674 --> 23:06.094
charged with violations
of the Espionage Act.

23:11.016 --> 23:12.768
And he's talking.

23:19.816 --> 23:22.277
So far, he's confirmed
a devastating account

23:22.360 --> 23:25.363
of Russian interference
in our Democratic process,

23:25.447 --> 23:26.948
including feeding you
and your committee

23:27.032 --> 23:29.326
a steady diet of
manipulated information

23:29.409 --> 23:30.619
designed to bring down

23:30.702 --> 23:32.788
the president
of the United States.

23:37.667 --> 23:40.212
You've been played, Sam.

23:40.295 --> 23:41.463
We all have.

23:41.546 --> 23:43.799
And we all have a lot
to answer for

23:43.882 --> 23:47.010
if this unfolds the wrong way.

23:48.136 --> 23:52.015
We are counting on
your discretion.

23:53.350 --> 23:54.935
My discretion?

23:55.018 --> 23:58.814
Dialing back on the impeachment
rhetoric, for starters.

23:58.897 --> 24:00.315
What's "UI"?

24:00.398 --> 24:02.234
It says it next to my name.

24:02.317 --> 24:04.528
Those are categories
used by the GRU.

24:04.611 --> 24:05.821
"T" for target,

24:05.904 --> 24:07.364
"RA" for recruited asset,

24:07.447 --> 24:09.199
"UI" for...

24:14.788 --> 24:16.748
What?

24:16.832 --> 24:19.084
Useful Idiot.

24:31.596 --> 24:34.683
All right, tell me how
this is gonna work.

24:36.351 --> 24:38.353
We spoke to Davis at the NSA.

24:38.436 --> 24:41.898
They've got a backdoor
into Twitter's base in Ireland.

24:41.982 --> 24:44.860
They slip us in there,
and we launch the code.

24:44.943 --> 24:46.736
Which is what, exactly?

24:46.820 --> 24:50.115
It comes out of a Twitter handle
called "Real Trade Tramp."

24:50.198 --> 24:51.992
Claims she's a freelance
stock tipster,

24:52.075 --> 24:53.702
was fired by J.P. Morgan.

24:53.785 --> 24:56.872
The accounts are registered
to a real estate LLC in Florida

24:56.955 --> 24:58.540
called Wyker Properties.

24:58.623 --> 25:00.083
Dante was told to follow
the account,

25:00.167 --> 25:03.336
and if he saw the phrase "Darwin
loves Bitcoin," sign off.

25:03.420 --> 25:04.796
Trade Tramp has
a few thousand followers,

25:04.880 --> 25:06.882
mostly there
for the folksy advice.

25:06.965 --> 25:10.218
They'll see the tweet
and presumably dump Bitcoin.

25:10.302 --> 25:11.553
But the rest should reply.

25:11.636 --> 25:13.555
"What about Ripple?"
means they copy.

25:15.307 --> 25:16.933
It's a poison pill.

25:18.435 --> 25:19.561
Sandy.

25:19.644 --> 25:21.313
Or it's a digital flare
from Dante to Yevgeny,

25:21.396 --> 25:22.731
warning him that
he's been compromised

25:22.814 --> 25:24.357
and we're gonna deploy it
for him.

25:24.441 --> 25:25.984
That's clever.
Your guy's not dumb.

25:26.067 --> 25:29.613
Dante thinks they tried to
kill him and almost succeeded.

25:29.696 --> 25:31.740
He's not gonna warn Yevgeny
we're on his trail.

25:31.823 --> 25:34.743
That's your professional
opinion? Ah.

25:34.826 --> 25:36.286
Yes.

25:36.369 --> 25:40.248
And he has no idea it was you
that poisoned him? Not them?

25:40.332 --> 25:43.293
- No, he doesn't.
- I'm just saying...

25:43.376 --> 25:45.170
What, you really think there's
a single fucking person

25:45.253 --> 25:47.589
on the planet more skeptical of
Dante Allen than me right now?

25:47.672 --> 25:50.091
It's a digital dead drop.
We have no idea what it means.

25:50.175 --> 25:51.927
Good judgment or not,
at least acknowledge the fact

25:52.010 --> 25:54.012
that we are
shooting in the dark.

25:55.388 --> 25:57.140
We got a better play?

26:02.771 --> 26:04.522
Did the president
authorize it?

26:04.606 --> 26:07.150
She's not crazy about it,
but, yeah.

26:09.694 --> 26:11.655
If it works...

26:11.738 --> 26:13.031
what's the next step?

26:13.114 --> 26:16.660
Launch the code, wait for
his team to acknowledge.

26:20.205 --> 26:23.500
I got a watch list
a mile long.

26:23.583 --> 26:25.543
Anything we get
on a live user,

26:25.627 --> 26:28.713
I can crosscheck to see if
it's somebody we recognize.

26:31.591 --> 26:32.842
Let's go.

26:58.785 --> 27:00.287
How's 20 minutes?
Is that right from...

27:00.370 --> 27:02.831
- Come with me.
- I'll get back to you.

27:07.627 --> 27:12.048
How did Mathison
make contact with you?

27:12.132 --> 27:14.384
Carrie? When?

27:14.467 --> 27:17.804
Initially. You sorority sisters
or somethin'?

27:19.514 --> 27:21.474
Charlie Gilweit at the DIA
called me,

27:21.558 --> 27:24.185
said Carrie wanted to talk,
and I should take the meeting.

27:24.269 --> 27:26.855
Did you check her out before you
put her in a room with me?

27:26.938 --> 27:29.524
Charlie Gilweit's
a two-star general.

27:31.693 --> 27:33.862
Unless the White House
has concocted

27:33.945 --> 27:36.072
a truly epic web of lies,

27:36.156 --> 27:38.742
which is, of course,
always a possibility,

27:38.825 --> 27:40.827
I am the tip of the spear

27:40.910 --> 27:44.080
of one of the most insidious
attacks ever perpetrated

27:44.164 --> 27:47.208
on the institution
of American democracy.

27:47.292 --> 27:51.087
And everything I've said in
public in the last three months

27:51.171 --> 27:53.173
has been an elaborate fiction

27:53.256 --> 27:55.675
authored by the military
intelligence wing

27:55.759 --> 27:57.802
of the Russian government.

27:59.721 --> 28:02.223
Carrie... is a...

28:02.307 --> 28:06.144
No, Simone Martin is.
And Dante Allen.

28:06.227 --> 28:09.230
Mathison's just a stooge,

28:09.314 --> 28:11.733
like me and you.

28:11.816 --> 28:15.904
- How can you be sure?
- Because as explanations go,

28:15.987 --> 28:18.740
this one bears the unfortunate
hallmark of making

28:18.823 --> 28:22.744
all the fucking sense
in the world.

28:29.542 --> 28:32.003
When are they going public
with the news?

28:32.087 --> 28:33.505
I don't know.

28:33.588 --> 28:35.757
Dante's in the middle of
briefing the authorities.

28:37.175 --> 28:38.885
We need to get out
in front of it, then.

28:38.968 --> 28:40.762
- I can...
- We can't.

28:40.845 --> 28:43.973
- Why not?
- It would compromise the effort

28:44.057 --> 28:45.433
to take down
the Russian network.

28:45.517 --> 28:48.728
What we need is
a face-saving measure.

28:48.812 --> 28:52.023
Build a narrative about unity
in the face of adversity.

28:52.107 --> 28:54.025
Some crap like that.

28:54.109 --> 28:56.486
Fine.

28:56.569 --> 28:58.363
But when they're ready,

28:58.446 --> 29:00.281
you get to make
the announcement

29:00.365 --> 29:02.575
and your committee leads
the investigation in Congress.

29:02.659 --> 29:04.911
They want a deal?
That's the price.

29:04.994 --> 29:07.205
I can sit down with them
first thing in the morning.

29:07.288 --> 29:08.623
Yeah.

29:31.229 --> 29:33.148
- Clayton.
- <i>What the hell
is going on?</i>

29:33.231 --> 29:35.150
- What do you mean?
<i>- Are we going to ground?</i>

29:35.233 --> 29:36.568
What? No.

29:36.651 --> 29:39.404
<i>- The burn code. You sent it.</i>
- No, I didn't.

29:39.487 --> 29:42.407
<i>What do you think? I'm making
it up? Look at the feed.</i>

29:47.787 --> 29:49.622
- Have you found Dante?
<i>- He's in the E.R.</i>

29:49.706 --> 29:51.332
<i>They got a bunch of guys
guarding the place.</i>

29:51.416 --> 29:52.876
<i>I don't know what's wrong
with him.</i>

29:52.959 --> 29:54.919
- He fucking gave them the code.
<i>- What do you want me to do?</i>

29:55.003 --> 29:58.298
Nothing. Nothing.
Just stay there, wait for me.

29:58.381 --> 30:01.426
Whatever you do, do not--
do not go to ground.

30:18.526 --> 30:21.279
Mm-hmm.

31:12.205 --> 31:13.831
We got another one.

31:13.915 --> 31:16.626
Yep. Here we go.

31:16.709 --> 31:18.294
Why are they all overseas?

31:18.378 --> 31:21.422
Those are Tor servers--
Romania, Germany.

31:21.506 --> 31:24.676
It gives us a place to start,
but it takes a while.

31:24.759 --> 31:26.761
They work pretty hard
to stay anonymized.

31:26.844 --> 31:28.304
We pray for the lazy ones--

31:28.388 --> 31:31.182
some genius who logs in
from Starbucks.

31:34.143 --> 31:35.603
Sandy.

31:35.687 --> 31:37.647
Yep.

31:39.023 --> 31:41.734
J. Wittkowski.

31:41.818 --> 31:44.737
U.T. Austin. Sophomore.

31:44.821 --> 31:46.614
Little shit.

31:46.698 --> 31:47.991
Another amplifier.

31:48.074 --> 31:49.867
He's got the best part-time job
on campus.

31:49.951 --> 31:51.244
Pays for a lot of Adderall.

31:51.327 --> 31:53.037
Do they even know
who they're working for?

31:53.121 --> 31:54.330
Most of them probably don't.

31:54.414 --> 31:56.165
One or two may have been
recruited in person.

31:56.249 --> 31:58.751
17, ladies and gentlemen.

32:01.087 --> 32:04.340
- Not bad.
- Yeah.

32:06.175 --> 32:07.719
Hey, you mind if
I duck out for a bit?

32:07.802 --> 32:09.137
I should touch base
with my sister.

32:09.220 --> 32:10.847
She was in high dungeon.

32:10.930 --> 32:12.932
Sure. It's up to
the quants now anyhow.

32:13.016 --> 32:15.393
Thanks.

32:15.476 --> 32:16.811
Be nice.

32:16.894 --> 32:19.188
Your sister's just worried
about you and the kid.

32:19.272 --> 32:21.774
Yeah.

32:21.858 --> 32:22.984
Saul.

32:23.067 --> 32:24.861
Where the hell is that?

32:24.944 --> 32:26.279
Connecticut.

32:26.362 --> 32:28.906
Is that a bounce
or a real location?

32:28.990 --> 32:30.074
Give me a sec.

32:30.158 --> 32:32.702
User logged in
from an AT&T server.

32:32.785 --> 32:35.955
That's what I'm talkin' about.
There's one in every class.

32:36.039 --> 32:38.791
Paul Wyler. Red Strake Capital.

32:38.875 --> 32:43.296
Paul Wyler.
Personal wealth manager.

32:43.379 --> 32:45.590
SEC flagged him in 2013

32:45.673 --> 32:48.009
for work done on behalf
of client Wang Xiaobo.

32:48.092 --> 32:49.510
Beijing real estate
developer.

32:49.594 --> 32:52.472
Wyler was investigated,
no charges filed.

32:52.555 --> 32:55.642
If I'm Yevgeny, I'd let him
handle my money.

32:55.725 --> 32:57.185
Client list, affiliated firms?

32:57.268 --> 32:58.519
Yep.

32:58.603 --> 33:00.146
18.

33:00.229 --> 33:01.481
Sharon, I need counterintel

33:01.564 --> 33:03.232
to have a friendly chat
with Paul Wyler.

33:03.316 --> 33:05.777
- W-Y-L-E-R.
- Greenwich.

33:05.860 --> 33:07.111
Greenwich, Connecticut.

33:26.339 --> 33:28.966
- Hey.
- Hi.

33:29.050 --> 33:31.052
How's it goin'?

33:31.135 --> 33:33.971
Okay.

33:34.055 --> 33:35.431
Maggie around?

33:35.515 --> 33:37.225
Uh, no.

33:37.308 --> 33:39.519
I called her office.
They said she wasn't there.

33:39.602 --> 33:42.563
Maybe a haircut
or something?

33:44.899 --> 33:46.984
Franny's at school?

33:47.068 --> 33:48.903
Yeah.

33:48.986 --> 33:50.321
Was she all right
this morning?

33:50.405 --> 33:53.908
Uh, better than yesterday.
She slept.

33:53.991 --> 33:57.036
Good. I felt awful
about that.

33:57.120 --> 33:59.872
I didn't wanna leave, but...

33:59.956 --> 34:01.791
there was a pretty big thing
going down

34:01.874 --> 34:04.669
with a double agent
and a foreign infiltration.

34:04.752 --> 34:06.421
I think we may have
stopped it.

34:06.504 --> 34:09.590
Came up with a kind of amazing
counterpunch, actually.

34:09.674 --> 34:11.467
That's great.

34:11.551 --> 34:15.263
I'm sorry. I-I know this
sounds like science fiction.

34:15.346 --> 34:16.806
I... believe you.

34:16.889 --> 34:19.934
I believe you were doing
something important.

34:20.017 --> 34:22.019
So does Maggie.

34:22.103 --> 34:25.606
When's she coming home?

34:25.690 --> 34:28.359
Uh, I don't know.

34:28.443 --> 34:31.112
Can you call and ask her?

34:31.195 --> 34:32.530
She's not answering
my calls

34:32.613 --> 34:34.991
'cause she's trying
to make a point, and...

34:35.074 --> 34:36.868
she's made it.

34:36.951 --> 34:39.662
Can you just call and find out
when she'll be back?

34:41.122 --> 34:42.331
Um...

34:42.415 --> 34:44.542
All right,
know what? Forget it.

34:44.625 --> 34:46.002
She'll pick up
the home phone.

34:46.085 --> 34:47.962
Carrie. Carrie.

34:48.045 --> 34:49.672
- Carrie, stop.
- What the fuck?

34:49.756 --> 34:52.592
Don't call her. She's...

34:52.675 --> 34:55.845
She's talking to a lawyer.

34:55.928 --> 34:59.265
- About?
- Franny.

35:02.185 --> 35:04.437
What's the name
of this lawyer?

35:05.605 --> 35:07.690
Goddamn it. Tell me
where your wife is.

35:07.774 --> 35:10.193
No. No.

35:10.276 --> 35:13.279
I'm sorry. I-I know
that this is painful.

35:13.362 --> 35:15.323
Look, I made a mistake.

35:15.406 --> 35:19.035
Bringing Franny to Dante's,
that was...

35:19.118 --> 35:21.204
that was a big mistake.

35:21.287 --> 35:24.207
But I am not the only parent
in this world who has stumbled.

35:24.290 --> 35:26.918
- That was more than a stumble.
- Yeah, I'm aware of that.

35:27.001 --> 35:30.296
I-I don't really think
that you are.

35:30.379 --> 35:32.173
You can't provide her
with a stable home,

35:32.256 --> 35:34.634
so we are going to. Not for
a week, not for six months.

35:34.717 --> 35:36.344
That is too damaging
for a child.

35:36.427 --> 35:38.179
And if she doesn't get
some stability in her life,

35:38.262 --> 35:40.223
she's gonna end up
just like you.

35:48.689 --> 35:50.483
Carrie.

35:57.406 --> 35:58.658
Hello?

35:58.741 --> 36:00.743
<i>What in God's name
are you doing?</i>

36:00.827 --> 36:02.787
<i>Mirov called. He's furious.</i>

36:02.870 --> 36:04.163
<i>He said you won't
answer the phone.</i>

36:04.247 --> 36:07.250
Dante Allen is cooperating
with the Americans, Simone.

36:07.333 --> 36:09.377
<i>I know, and I'm sorry.</i>

36:09.460 --> 36:11.003
<i>But we are no longer
in a position</i>

36:11.087 --> 36:12.755
<i>to salvage the network,
which means you have to...</i>

36:12.839 --> 36:15.675
I don't give a fuck about
the network, Simone.

36:15.758 --> 36:17.844
- They've got one of us
in custody.
<i>- Mirov's panicking,</i>

36:17.927 --> 36:21.764
<i>and so are you. Calm down,
speak to him respectfully,</i>

36:21.848 --> 36:23.683
<i>and maybe he'll send you
reinforcement.</i>

36:23.766 --> 36:24.934
Did he say that?

36:25.017 --> 36:27.562
<i>He said if you
don't re-establish contact,</i>

36:27.645 --> 36:30.898
<i>he will designate you rogue.</i>

36:30.982 --> 36:32.942
<i>Did you hear me?</i>

36:33.025 --> 36:35.444
Yes.

36:37.613 --> 36:40.867
<i>I'm sorry about Dante.</i>

36:40.950 --> 36:42.368
Ah, it's not your fault.

36:42.451 --> 36:43.828
<i>Of course it is.</i>

36:43.911 --> 36:45.746
<i>And I will take
full responsibility.</i>

36:45.830 --> 36:48.749
Hey, uh, Simi,
I got another call coming.

36:48.833 --> 36:50.126
<i>It's probably Mirov.</i>

36:50.209 --> 36:52.461
<i>Answer him.
Don't make him wait.</i>

36:52.545 --> 36:54.589
Yeah, I'll call you back.

37:01.637 --> 37:02.805
<i>It's Wyler. What the fuck
is going on?</i>

37:02.889 --> 37:04.181
Honey,
who are these people?

37:04.265 --> 37:06.434
<i>Are you there? Hello?</i>

37:08.519 --> 37:09.937
Are you calling me from
an encrypted line?

37:10.021 --> 37:11.647
<i>I don't fucking know!</i>

37:11.731 --> 37:14.233
<i>I have two assholes from
the FBI at my front door!</i>

37:14.317 --> 37:15.568
<i>What am I supposed
to tell them?!</i>

37:15.651 --> 37:17.820
Nothing. Not a single word.

37:17.904 --> 37:19.280
Do you understand?

37:19.363 --> 37:21.866
Don't say anything. Get a lawyer
and never call me again.

37:21.949 --> 37:23.367
<i>What the fuck are you...</i>

38:06.953 --> 38:08.829
- This isn't a good idea.
- Thanks for your input.

38:08.913 --> 38:11.958
- Carrie...
- Stay the fuck away
from my kid.

38:12.041 --> 38:14.085
Carrie!

38:54.667 --> 38:57.712
Mirov called.
Says he can't reach you.

38:57.795 --> 39:01.674
Yeah. I had to dump
my phone.

39:01.757 --> 39:03.300
Is he sending a team?

39:03.384 --> 39:04.719
No.

39:06.262 --> 39:07.972
He has a plane waiting.

39:08.055 --> 39:09.974
He wants me
to take you there.

39:10.057 --> 39:12.435
I told him it was
a nonstarter.

39:17.273 --> 39:19.066
What does it look like
in there?

39:19.150 --> 39:21.068
Allen's still in the E.R.

39:21.152 --> 39:22.778
They moved him
to a private area--

39:22.862 --> 39:24.196
locked halls, key cards,

39:24.280 --> 39:26.949
security guards all over
the place checking I.D.

39:27.033 --> 39:28.743
Family and patients only.

39:28.826 --> 39:31.787
I got in there for a minute,
but they hustled me out quick.

39:31.871 --> 39:34.498
Hospital security or...

39:34.582 --> 39:36.417
Feds.

39:44.592 --> 39:47.928
Swap seats with me.
I wanna drive.

40:05.988 --> 40:07.615
Do you have another phone
for me?

40:07.698 --> 40:09.450
Yeah.

40:15.664 --> 40:18.000
Breathe.

40:18.084 --> 40:20.836
Breathe. You'll be fine.

40:20.920 --> 40:23.297
We're at the hospital.

40:31.722 --> 40:33.474
Help! He's been shot!

40:33.557 --> 40:35.768
GSW at 1B. This way.

40:35.851 --> 40:37.478
Get a gurney in there.

40:40.272 --> 40:42.316
Here we go, here we go.
Let's get him in the R...

40:42.399 --> 40:45.903
He's not breathing!

40:45.986 --> 40:49.907
- We gotta control this bleeding.
- Let's get him on hypo O2.

40:49.990 --> 40:53.869
- Excuse us, excuse us!
- Get a peripheral pulse.

40:53.953 --> 40:55.996
- How many extra fluids do you have?
- No pulse. Start the pressure.

40:56.080 --> 40:57.706
Sir, why don't you come with me?
We'll get you cleaned up.

40:57.790 --> 41:00.584
Cardiac surgeon down here.

41:10.469 --> 41:11.637
Hi.

41:11.720 --> 41:13.055
- Sorry, can you help me?
- Sure.

41:13.139 --> 41:15.349
I need to pull my daughter out
a little early today.

41:15.432 --> 41:18.686
Franny Mathison. She's in
Room 107 with Mrs. Clarke.

41:18.769 --> 41:21.856
Of course. Let me just
call the classroom.

41:21.939 --> 41:23.149
Mm-hmm.

41:24.483 --> 41:25.985
Hi, Julia.

41:26.068 --> 41:28.654
Is Franny Mathison in the room
now or are they in the gym?

41:28.737 --> 41:31.115
Tanya.

41:32.199 --> 41:34.660
I'm going to call you
right back.

41:34.743 --> 41:37.329
Ms. Mathison.
Hi. I'm Jim Lippard.

41:37.413 --> 41:39.456
I think we met at, uh,
Curriculum Night.

41:39.540 --> 41:41.750
Uh, yeah. I-I think so.

41:41.834 --> 41:43.502
Franny's uncle, uh, Bill,
I think?

41:43.586 --> 41:47.256
- Yeah.
- He just called
and asked that Franny stay here

41:47.339 --> 41:49.550
- for the rest of the school day.
- She and I have an appointment.

41:49.633 --> 41:52.052
So I'll check in
with my brother-in-law later,

41:52.136 --> 41:54.221
but I'd like to get
my daughter now.

41:54.305 --> 41:56.098
He said there's a lot
going on right now.

41:56.182 --> 41:58.601
And I know these things
can be tricky.

41:58.684 --> 42:00.561
Franny's got a lot of
people who love her,

42:00.644 --> 42:02.897
- which is great.
- I'm Franny's mother.

42:02.980 --> 42:05.816
My sister and her husband spend
a lot of time with her.

42:05.900 --> 42:08.319
She's stayed with them when
I've had to work overseas,

42:08.402 --> 42:10.070
but I'm her
only legal guardian,

42:10.154 --> 42:12.948
and I need you
to bring her out now.

42:13.032 --> 42:15.159
Or I-I can
go get her myself.

42:16.660 --> 42:18.954
- I'll get her.
- Thank you.

42:19.038 --> 42:21.457
They're in the gym.

42:24.293 --> 42:26.545
Continued compressions.
His pulses are not breathing.

42:26.629 --> 42:27.838
- We're losing him.
- He's crashing, guys.

42:27.922 --> 42:29.590
Set up an intubation tray.

42:34.553 --> 42:37.097
Okay, keep bagging him.
Just keep pushing.

42:37.181 --> 42:38.349
All right, suction.

42:38.432 --> 42:39.808
<i>Code blue in E.R.</i>

42:39.892 --> 42:41.810
<i>Code blue in E.R.</i>

42:41.894 --> 42:43.687
All right,
let's go, let's go.

42:43.771 --> 42:45.981
Line started for me.

43:36.448 --> 43:39.493
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

43:39.576 --> 43:42.746
I just need to know what
you told the government.

43:42.830 --> 43:44.999
Fuck you.

43:47.418 --> 43:48.919
You tried to kill me.

43:49.003 --> 43:50.504
What are you
talking about?

43:50.587 --> 43:52.298
You poisoned me.

43:54.925 --> 43:57.261
That's why you're here?

43:57.344 --> 43:59.346
We didn't try to poison you.

43:59.430 --> 44:03.392
The lawyer... you sent.

44:05.436 --> 44:08.355
We didn't send you
a lawyer.

44:14.069 --> 44:16.739
Who was holding you?

44:16.822 --> 44:19.742
Mathison?

44:19.825 --> 44:23.245
So she tells you that we sent
someone in to poison you,

44:23.329 --> 44:25.205
and you believed her?

44:25.289 --> 44:28.083
I don't poison
my own people.

44:28.167 --> 44:29.585
I have...

44:29.668 --> 44:32.546
I have many flaws...

44:32.629 --> 44:34.673
but that isn't one of them.

44:37.551 --> 44:41.388
I protect my people.

44:43.182 --> 44:44.767
You don't believe me?

44:47.311 --> 44:49.480
Call her.

44:52.649 --> 44:56.070
Call her and ask.

44:56.153 --> 44:58.238
And listen.

44:58.322 --> 44:59.698
Listen to her voice

44:59.782 --> 45:02.659
as she works out
how to lie to you.

45:33.649 --> 45:35.943
- Hey, sweetheart. You ready?
- Yeah.

45:36.026 --> 45:38.821
Mrs. Clarke said there's
a spelling sheet in her folder.

45:38.904 --> 45:42.866
It's in the backpack.
They're doing it in class today.

45:42.950 --> 45:44.618
Franny can bring it tomorrow.

45:44.701 --> 45:48.414
- Uh, excuse me for one second.
Uh... Dante?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

45:48.497 --> 45:51.291
Can I call you back in, like,
five minutes?

45:51.375 --> 45:52.835
Did you poison me?

45:52.918 --> 45:56.463
Um...

45:56.547 --> 45:59.466
- W-what are you...
<i>- The lawyer.</i>

45:59.550 --> 46:02.344
Was he one of yours?

46:03.429 --> 46:05.764
Are you out of
your fucking mind?

46:05.848 --> 46:07.683
No. I did not.

46:07.766 --> 46:10.602
My God, why would you even
think that? That's...

46:10.686 --> 46:14.815
<i>That's insane. U-um...</i>

46:14.898 --> 46:16.316
- I'm gonna come there.
- Mommy.

46:16.400 --> 46:19.111
I-I just picked up Franny.
We'll come to the hospital.

46:20.946 --> 46:23.782
Dante?

46:23.866 --> 46:25.701
Dante.

46:25.784 --> 46:27.578
Hang up that phone.

46:32.833 --> 46:34.710
Yevgeny's here.
Lock down the hospital...

46:36.253 --> 46:37.379
Dante! Fuck!

46:45.053 --> 46:46.680
Aw, shit.

46:46.763 --> 46:48.682
Um... some-something's happened
and I have to go.

46:48.765 --> 46:51.059
She has to stay here.
It-it's an emergency.

46:51.143 --> 46:52.519
<i>Carrie.</i>

46:52.603 --> 46:54.313
Yevgeny's in the hospital.
He found Dante.

46:54.396 --> 46:56.857
Lock down the hospital. Hey,
you need to go back to class.

46:56.940 --> 46:58.859
I love you, baby. I'm gonna see
you after school, okay?

46:58.942 --> 47:00.944
- I have to go.
- No, Mommy! No, Mommy, no.

47:01.028 --> 47:04.698
No, babe. I gotta go.
I gotta go.

47:09.828 --> 47:10.871
Franny!

47:10.954 --> 47:14.625
Shit.

47:14.708 --> 47:17.753
Mommy!

47:21.256 --> 47:23.008
Get her!

47:25.093 --> 47:26.970
No, Mommy, no!

47:27.054 --> 47:30.224
No!

47:57.209 --> 47:58.627
No, no, no!

48:18.564 --> 48:20.941
You cannot park there!
You don't have a tag.

48:32.703 --> 48:34.121
What happened?
Is he okay?

48:34.204 --> 48:35.998
- He didn't make it.
- He didn't make it.

48:43.672 --> 48:44.798
<i>Brody!</i>

48:44.881 --> 48:46.842
Brody!

49:04.484 --> 49:07.070
Hey!

49:11.450 --> 49:15.245
What did you do?
