00:05.230 --> 00:08.940
Captain's log, stardate 43173.5.

00:09.100 --> 00:10.770
We are en route to Mintaka III,

00:10.940 --> 00:13.610
where a Federation
anthropological team

00:13.770 --> 00:16.079
has been studying the inhabitants.

00:16.239 --> 00:18.510
Our mission
is to resupply the outpost

00:18.680 --> 00:21.220
and repair
their malfunctioning reactor.

00:21.350 --> 00:25.050
- Mr La Forge, report.
- We replicated the parts.

00:25.220 --> 00:31.190
But why does a three-man station
need a 4.2 gigawatt reactor?

00:31.360 --> 00:35.260
Enough to power a small phaser bank,
a relay station, or...?

00:35.430 --> 00:37.770
Or a hologram generator.

00:37.930 --> 00:41.540
A duck blind!
Right, they're anthropologists.

00:41.700 --> 00:46.040
Who are studying an extended family
of Mintakans at close range,

00:46.210 --> 00:48.740
from a camouflaged observation post.

00:48.910 --> 00:52.410
Dr Barron's preliminary reports
say the Mintakans

00:52.580 --> 00:56.150
are proto-Vulcan humanoids
at the Bronze-Age level.

00:56.320 --> 00:59.690
- Peaceful and highly rational.
- Not surprising.

00:59.850 --> 01:01.920
Their evolution parallels Vulcan.

01:02.090 --> 01:05.090
Captain,
transmission from Mintaka III.

01:05.260 --> 01:07.590
Thank you, Lieutenant. On screen.

01:08.760 --> 01:12.100
Barron to Enterprise.
Our repairs have failed.

01:12.270 --> 01:14.130
The reactor is inoperative.

01:14.300 --> 01:17.540
- Do you have battery back-up?
- Three hours at best.

01:17.710 --> 01:22.140
If we increase to warp seven,
we can be there in 23 minutes.

01:22.310 --> 01:25.680
Make it so. We're on our way...

01:27.000 --> 01:33.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:55.110 --> 01:56.880
We've lost contact, sir.

01:57.780 --> 01:59.910
Increase to warp nine.

02:29.080 --> 02:32.080
Space, the final frontier.

02:33.910 --> 02:37.820
These are the voyages
of the Starship Enterprise.

02:37.990 --> 02:42.090
Its continuing mission,
to explore strange new worlds...

02:43.360 --> 02:46.760
...to seek out new life
and new civilisations...

02:48.000 --> 02:51.370
...to boldly go
where no one has gone before.

04:04.410 --> 04:07.910
The framework's still charged,
so watch it.

04:16.420 --> 04:19.589
Why did we have to come so early?

04:19.750 --> 04:23.820
When the sun reaches its zenith,
I must take the measurements.

04:23.990 --> 04:26.860
You've read the sundial
hundreds of times.

04:27.030 --> 04:30.930
Yes, Father, but never
as the appointed record keeper.

04:39.610 --> 04:42.740
You're taking your duties
quite seriously.

04:42.910 --> 04:45.310
Your mother would have been
very proud.

04:49.080 --> 04:50.380
What is that?

04:51.550 --> 04:53.850
Up there, Father! What is it?

04:54.020 --> 04:55.890
I don't know.

05:08.840 --> 05:10.870
Keep work... Palmer...?

05:11.040 --> 05:13.740
It's alright.

05:21.120 --> 05:23.880
The holographic generator
is functioning.

05:24.050 --> 05:27.420
- All we need now is power.
- Almost there.

05:49.240 --> 05:51.410
You wait here, Oji.

06:34.020 --> 06:38.230
Enterprise, beam Martinez
and his patient directly to sickbay.

06:50.840 --> 06:52.910
Commander?

07:06.620 --> 07:10.460
- Doctor, be careful.
- I've got to get down there.

07:35.650 --> 07:37.280
Crusher to Enterprise.

07:37.450 --> 07:41.290
Medical emergency.
Two to beam directly to sickbay.

07:41.460 --> 07:43.190
Aye, Doctor.

07:54.300 --> 07:56.300
That should do it.

08:44.650 --> 08:47.790
You increased the levels
of tricordrazine?

09:07.270 --> 09:09.240
Dr Crusher?

09:15.780 --> 09:20.620
Before you quote the Prime Directive,
he'd already seen us.

09:20.790 --> 09:23.160
It was either bring him aboard
or let him die.

09:23.320 --> 09:25.790
Then why didn't you let him die?

09:25.960 --> 09:29.030
Because we were responsible
for his injuries!

09:30.700 --> 09:34.840
I'm not sure that I concur
with that reasoning, Doctor.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.370
But now that he's here,
you must remove all memory

09:38.540 --> 09:40.810
of his encounter with the away team.

09:40.970 --> 09:42.810
By erasing short-term recall?

09:42.980 --> 09:45.210
It has been accomplished before.

09:45.380 --> 09:48.880
I am familiar
with Dr Pulaski's technique.

09:49.050 --> 09:51.250
But will it be effective
on Mintakans?

09:51.420 --> 09:53.350
Their lie-zone levels are lower.

09:53.520 --> 09:56.260
Wait! No, no! We must evacuate!

09:56.420 --> 10:01.530
Dr Barron, you're on the Enterprise.
You're safe.

10:01.700 --> 10:03.260
And the others?

10:03.400 --> 10:06.570
Dr Warren is here.
We're doing all we can.

10:06.730 --> 10:09.870
- And where is Palmer?
- Still on Mintaka.

10:10.040 --> 10:12.240
- You have to find him!
- We will.

10:12.410 --> 10:13.870
He may be hurt.

10:14.040 --> 10:18.110
Rest assured, we shall not leave
until he is located.

10:18.280 --> 10:20.150
Thank you, Picard.

10:25.750 --> 10:27.960
Picard to bridge. Report.

10:28.090 --> 10:32.090
Scans on the planet
detect no humans, Captain.

10:32.260 --> 10:34.430
Very well. Put us in a close orbit.

10:34.600 --> 10:39.300
A close orbit will increase sensor
efficiency by only four percent.

10:39.470 --> 10:42.570
- I want that four percent.
- Aye, sir.

10:42.670 --> 10:44.300
Picard out.

10:45.470 --> 10:48.240
- Picard...?
- Damn!

10:55.480 --> 10:59.690
Well, Doctor,
your next task is clear.

11:28.650 --> 11:30.220
Oji?

11:41.360 --> 11:42.930
Father?

11:44.870 --> 11:45.900
Here!

11:54.810 --> 11:57.480
I thought I'd never see you again.

11:57.610 --> 12:01.980
When you and the woman vanished,
I was sure you were dead.

12:02.450 --> 12:07.250
I think I was.
But I was brought back to life.

12:08.960 --> 12:11.760
I awoke in an incredible place,

12:11.930 --> 12:14.290
and my wounds were gone.

12:15.230 --> 12:16.630
I had been healed.

12:17.600 --> 12:19.930
How is that possible?

12:24.640 --> 12:29.380
Long ago, our people believed
in beings with great powers.

12:29.540 --> 12:33.510
Those beings made the rains come,
they told the sun when to rise,

12:33.680 --> 12:37.120
they caused all life
to be born, to grow, to die.

12:37.280 --> 12:40.690
But those are just tales.
Old superstitions.

12:40.850 --> 12:44.560
But perhaps the beliefs
of our ancestors are true.

12:45.560 --> 12:49.130
Nothing else
can explain what's happened.

12:50.530 --> 12:55.570
Everything is changed now, Oji.
We must tell the others.

12:59.810 --> 13:02.480
Barron is stable,
but Warren is critical.

13:02.580 --> 13:07.010
Palmer is missing. A scan shows
no human life forms. However...

13:07.180 --> 13:10.680
The area around the duck blind
has karst topography.

13:10.850 --> 13:13.950
Sinkholes, underground rivers
and caverns.

13:14.120 --> 13:19.290
The rock strata has thallium compound
that may obstruct our sensor beams.

13:19.460 --> 13:24.630
If Palmer, delirious, is in a cave,
we wouldn't detect his life signs?

13:24.800 --> 13:26.270
Correct, sir.

13:26.430 --> 13:32.070
If he is still alive, we must send
an away team to locate him.

13:32.240 --> 13:36.940
But we must not interfere with
the development of the Mintakans.

13:37.110 --> 13:40.650
Agreed. Further contamination
must be prevented.

13:42.880 --> 13:44.720
I have a suggestion.

13:47.290 --> 13:51.390
First Officer's log,
stardate 43174.2.

13:51.560 --> 13:54.900
Troi and I are beaming down
to locate Dr Palmer,

13:55.060 --> 13:59.100
and to determine the extent
of the cultural contamination.

13:59.270 --> 14:03.140
Dr Crusher has temporarily
altered our features and color.

14:03.300 --> 14:06.440
She has implanted
subcutaneous communicators

14:06.610 --> 14:10.710
so that any transmissions
will be inaudible to the Mintakans.

14:10.880 --> 14:12.850
Enterprise, do you hear me?

14:13.010 --> 14:16.720
Perfectly, Commander.
I will monitor you continuously.

14:16.880 --> 14:19.290
Mintakan emotions are interesting.

14:19.450 --> 14:22.390
Like Vulcans,
they have highly-ordered minds.

14:22.560 --> 14:24.390
A very sensible people.

14:24.560 --> 14:28.630
For example,
Mintakan women precede their mates.

14:28.800 --> 14:32.870
- It's a signal to other women.
- He's taken, get your own?

14:33.030 --> 14:36.570
Not precisely. More like,
"If you want his services,

14:36.740 --> 14:38.870
I'm the one you negotiate with."

14:39.040 --> 14:42.180
- What kind of services?
- All kinds.

14:42.340 --> 14:44.310
They are a sensible race.

15:12.810 --> 15:14.810
I understand your scepticism.

15:14.980 --> 15:19.050
If it hadn't happened to me,
I would find it hard to accept.

15:19.210 --> 15:21.220
But it did happen.

15:21.380 --> 15:27.090
Fento, do the legends not speak
of beings like the kind I've seen?

15:27.250 --> 15:29.160
Who could vanish like smoke?

15:29.320 --> 15:31.660
There are stories of the Overseer,

15:31.830 --> 15:34.500
who could appear
and disappear at will.

15:34.630 --> 15:38.000
And couldn't this Overseer
heal the dead?

15:38.170 --> 15:43.170
He had supreme power,
or so our ancestors believed.

15:43.640 --> 15:46.540
I believe I have seen the Overseer.

15:47.640 --> 15:50.680
- He is called the Picard.
- Oh-oh!

15:50.840 --> 15:54.150
- His memory's intact.
- The procedure didn't work.

15:54.310 --> 15:57.620
Liko, all this talk
of supernatural beings.

15:57.790 --> 16:00.790
No one has believed that
for generations.

16:00.950 --> 16:04.890
Just as we no longer believe
that the stars control our fates

16:05.060 --> 16:08.230
or the spirits of the dead
haunt the living.

16:10.130 --> 16:14.300
Nuria, I'm not saying
that all the old beliefs are true.

16:14.470 --> 16:19.940
But I did see the Picard.
And I was restored back to life.

16:20.940 --> 16:25.410
We are visitors.
We've come to trade our cloth.

16:25.580 --> 16:27.450
- May we speak?
- Please do.

16:27.610 --> 16:30.780
We welcome outsiders. I am Nuria.

16:30.950 --> 16:37.020
I am Troi, this is Riker.
You had a very interesting dream.

16:37.390 --> 16:40.590
Dream? It was real!

16:41.460 --> 16:44.260
My father and I
both witnessed these beings.

16:44.430 --> 16:46.600
If you are father and daughter,

16:46.770 --> 16:49.600
you may well have shared
the same dream.

16:50.770 --> 16:52.740
That is not reasonable.

16:52.910 --> 16:58.080
Any less reasonable than being
magically transformed by the Picard?

16:58.250 --> 17:02.780
- Nuria!
- It has to be Palmer!

17:02.950 --> 17:07.859
- The one the Picard wished to find.
- You were speaking the truth!

17:08.020 --> 17:10.160
The Picard will be pleased.

17:15.630 --> 17:18.300
- Riker to Picard.
- Go ahead.

17:18.430 --> 17:19.700
We have a problem.

17:19.869 --> 17:23.300
- With the contamination?
- It's worse than we thought.

17:23.470 --> 17:26.609
The Mintakans
are beginning to believe in a god.

17:26.770 --> 17:30.280
And the one
they've chosen is you.

17:37.180 --> 17:40.650
Beam Palmer aboard.
Without medical attention...

17:40.820 --> 17:44.890
He is surrounded by Mintakans.
If he should dematerialize...

17:45.060 --> 17:49.460
It will slightly increase the
contamination which already exists.

17:49.630 --> 17:52.500
A small price
for saving Palmer's life.

17:53.930 --> 17:55.000
Number One?

17:55.170 --> 17:59.240
Is there any chance
of transporting Palmer unseen?

17:59.410 --> 18:01.440
- We can try.
- Try hard.

18:01.610 --> 18:03.540
- Picard out.
- I must protest.

18:03.710 --> 18:06.380
You endanger Palmer
with this delay.

18:06.450 --> 18:10.850
I am aware of that. But each of us,
including Dr Palmer,

18:11.020 --> 18:15.090
took an oath that we would
uphold the Prime Directive,

18:15.260 --> 18:17.620
if necessary, with our lives.

18:18.730 --> 18:22.960
We were hunting. We followed
a hornbuck into a cave.

18:23.130 --> 18:25.230
The stranger was there, asleep.

18:25.400 --> 18:27.740
Is he one of the Overseer's servants?

18:27.870 --> 18:31.370
Yes. The Picard has many servants.

18:31.470 --> 18:34.640
- Isn't that true, Fento?
- According to legend.

18:34.810 --> 18:40.350
But if he is the servant of
the Overseer, why was he in a cave?

18:40.510 --> 18:42.120
Perhaps he ran away.

18:42.250 --> 18:44.990
Or he failed the Picard
and was hiding.

18:45.150 --> 18:49.290
Bind him in case he wakes
and tries to escape.

18:49.460 --> 18:52.490
It's senseless
to hold this stranger captive.

18:52.660 --> 18:56.000
This talk of the Overseer,
it's old superstitions.

18:56.160 --> 18:57.500
I disagree.

18:57.670 --> 19:00.830
All the evidence indicates he exists.

19:01.000 --> 19:05.210
And I heard the Picard say
he wanted to find Palmer.

19:06.210 --> 19:10.280
By keeping Palmer safe,
we will please the Picard.

19:10.380 --> 19:13.150
He will grant us favors in return.

19:13.310 --> 19:14.450
Favors?

19:14.550 --> 19:17.620
It is said that the Overseer
is all-powerful.

19:17.790 --> 19:22.390
He can provide gentle winters,
plentiful hunting,

19:22.560 --> 19:24.660
fertile crops, anything.

19:24.830 --> 19:29.730
He can even...
bring back those who have died.

19:32.200 --> 19:35.570
It's agreed. We will save Palmer
for the Picard.

19:35.700 --> 19:36.700
Yes, yes.

19:36.870 --> 19:39.210
I've seen another one, like Palmer.

19:39.340 --> 19:43.780
- Another servant of the Picard?
- He's headed toward the caves.

19:43.940 --> 19:46.610
Fento, stay and bind Palmer.

20:01.430 --> 20:04.100
- Where?
- Over there.

20:05.770 --> 20:09.700
- That knot won't hold. If I may?
- Please do.

20:09.870 --> 20:14.310
You need a knot that will tighten
under pressure. Let me show you.

20:26.250 --> 20:29.790
The sun's reaching its zenith.
If I don't measure it...

20:29.960 --> 20:31.330
Go.

20:35.160 --> 20:39.630
Forgive me, friend,
but the stranger must be set free.

21:08.700 --> 21:12.700
Prepare to beam us to sickbay,
but hang on for my signal.

21:12.870 --> 21:14.600
Acknowledged, Commander.

21:14.770 --> 21:16.070
Riker, stop!

21:19.710 --> 21:22.510
It's Riker! He's taking Palmer!

21:22.610 --> 21:25.350
Hali! Yuri, don't let her escape!

22:31.650 --> 22:33.910
I'm clear. Energize.

22:47.700 --> 22:50.260
Data, has Counselor Troi beamed up?

22:50.430 --> 22:55.770
Negative. Sensors show she is in
the midst of a group of Mintakans.

22:55.940 --> 22:56.840
Damn!

23:04.080 --> 23:05.780
He is alright.

23:07.250 --> 23:10.620
Hali, find Riker and Palmer.

23:12.620 --> 23:14.920
Why did you and Riker take Palmer?

23:15.090 --> 23:16.760
We did not take Palmer.

23:16.920 --> 23:18.430
We set him free.

23:18.590 --> 23:22.600
Riker and I do not believe
in these fables about an Overseer.

23:22.760 --> 23:28.600
You've angered the Picard
and we may all suffer for it!

23:28.770 --> 23:32.810
I know. I've seen him.
He is all-powerful.

23:32.970 --> 23:35.940
Weren't there stories
about the Overseer

23:36.110 --> 23:38.580
destroying those who offended him?

23:38.750 --> 23:42.820
- Stories, nothing more.
- Liko, we'll get Palmer back.

23:42.980 --> 23:46.190
Riker was carrying him.
They can't have gone far.

23:46.350 --> 23:51.360
Still, the Picard may blame us
for letting Palmer escape.

23:54.160 --> 23:59.000
Perhaps we should punish her,
let the Overseer know

23:59.170 --> 24:01.540
that she and Riker acted alone.

24:01.700 --> 24:05.740
- We will keep Troi captive.
- That's not enough.

24:07.540 --> 24:09.310
You would have us harm her?

24:12.310 --> 24:16.720
If it will hold off
the Picard's anger, yes.

24:18.050 --> 24:20.150
I've seen how powerful he is.

24:24.060 --> 24:27.390
I am unwilling
to hurt her needlessly.

24:27.560 --> 24:30.230
We will wait for Hali to return.

24:30.360 --> 24:33.230
And if they don't find Palmer?

24:38.340 --> 24:41.510
Then we may do as Liko suggests.

24:48.450 --> 24:52.720
Doctor, you believe
they are capable of harming Troi?

24:52.890 --> 24:54.890
They are not normally violent,

24:55.060 --> 24:57.960
but these are
extraordinary circumstances.

24:58.130 --> 25:00.930
They're trying to comprehend a god.

25:06.970 --> 25:08.400
Recommendations?

25:08.570 --> 25:12.270
The Mintakans can only guess
what the Overseer wants.

25:12.440 --> 25:13.840
They need a sign.

25:14.010 --> 25:17.180
- Are you suggesting...?
- You must go down there.

25:17.340 --> 25:20.410
- Masquerading as a god?
- Out of the question.

25:20.580 --> 25:23.250
- The Prime Directive...
- Has been violated.

25:23.350 --> 25:26.590
The damage is done.
All we can do now is minimize it.

25:26.750 --> 25:30.260
- Sanction false beliefs?
- Give them guidelines.

25:30.420 --> 25:32.860
Let them know
what the Overseer expects.

25:33.030 --> 25:37.630
I cannot, I will not, impose a set
of commandments on these people.

25:37.800 --> 25:41.140
To do so violates the essence
of the Prime Directive!

25:41.300 --> 25:44.710
We have rekindled
their belief in the Overseer.

25:44.870 --> 25:48.480
Are you saying that this belief
will become a religion?

25:48.640 --> 25:51.710
It's inevitable.
And without guidance,

25:51.880 --> 25:57.550
that religion could degenerate
into inquisitions, holy wars, chaos.

26:00.390 --> 26:02.060
Horrifying.

26:03.060 --> 26:04.890
Dr Barron.

26:05.060 --> 26:09.000
Your report describes
how rational these people are.

26:09.160 --> 26:13.400
Millennia ago, they abandoned
their belief in the supernatural.

26:13.570 --> 26:17.000
You are asking me
to sabotage that achievement,

26:17.170 --> 26:19.340
to send them back to the Dark Ages

26:19.510 --> 26:23.080
of superstition
and ignorance and fear? No!

26:28.050 --> 26:31.950
We will find some way
to undo the damage we've caused.

26:34.560 --> 26:38.560
Number One,
tell me about this group's leader.

26:39.160 --> 26:44.930
Nuria. Clear-minded, sensible.
The Mintakans trust her judgement.

26:45.100 --> 26:47.770
If we can convince her
that you are not a god...

26:47.900 --> 26:49.940
She may persuade the others.

26:50.100 --> 26:53.510
And how do you propose
to convince her?

26:53.670 --> 26:58.180
She believes the Picard
is a magical figure.

27:00.310 --> 27:03.750
I'm going to show her
how the magic works.

27:04.520 --> 27:06.490
I'm going to bring her aboard.

27:10.290 --> 27:15.160
Sensors indicate five Mintakans
in your immediate vicinity.

27:15.330 --> 27:19.370
Four are motionless,
the fifth is proceeding south.

27:19.530 --> 27:23.070
Is Nuria one of these five?

27:24.840 --> 27:28.340
- Was that intended as affirmative?
- Yes, Data.

27:28.510 --> 27:31.510
Is Nuria the closest?

27:31.680 --> 27:32.980
Negative.

27:33.150 --> 27:36.850
Is Nuria the one in motion?

27:37.480 --> 27:39.250
Lock sensors on Nuria.

27:39.420 --> 27:42.690
Locked on.
We can beam Nuria aboard at will.

27:42.860 --> 27:46.390
When sensors indicate
that she's alone, beam her up.

27:46.560 --> 27:47.830
Aye, sir.

27:59.970 --> 28:02.480
- Ensign Hoy?
- Nuria is alone.

28:02.640 --> 28:04.380
I'll handle this.

28:19.430 --> 28:20.790
Nuria.

28:20.960 --> 28:24.970
Don't be afraid.
No one is going to harm you.

28:26.100 --> 28:27.400
Who...?

28:30.900 --> 28:35.680
I am Jean-Luc... Picard.

28:44.120 --> 28:45.820
Please, get up.

28:45.990 --> 28:48.390
Get up. You must not kneel to me.

28:49.220 --> 28:51.990
- You do not wish it?
- I do not deserve it.

28:58.200 --> 29:00.300
Look at me.

29:07.880 --> 29:11.850
Feel... the warmth of my hand.

29:15.250 --> 29:17.380
The rhythm of my pulse.

29:18.850 --> 29:21.190
I'm not a supreme being.

29:22.220 --> 29:24.430
I'm flesh and blood, like you.

29:25.090 --> 29:29.030
- Not like me.
- Like you. Different in appearance.

29:29.200 --> 29:34.540
But we are both living beings.
We are born, we grow, we live.

29:34.640 --> 29:36.140
And we die.

29:37.040 --> 29:40.740
In all the ways that matter,
we are alike.

29:40.910 --> 29:43.440
But you are the Picard!

29:48.720 --> 29:51.720
There's something I want you to see.

29:55.990 --> 29:58.330
What a wondrous place!

29:58.490 --> 30:01.230
Even the walls obey your command.

30:01.400 --> 30:03.960
Wondrous, yes, but not miraculous.

30:04.130 --> 30:09.400
The doors merely work differently
from the ones you know.

30:20.380 --> 30:22.780
That is my home?

30:24.390 --> 30:26.950
Seen from far, far above.

30:29.120 --> 30:31.060
Yet we do not fall.

30:36.860 --> 30:41.540
I never imagined I would see
the clouds from the other side.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.570
Your powers are truly boundless.

31:04.960 --> 31:08.460
Your people live in huts.
Was it always so?

31:08.630 --> 31:10.100
No.

31:11.370 --> 31:14.300
We have found remnants of tools
in caves.

31:14.470 --> 31:16.440
Our ancestors lived there.

31:16.600 --> 31:20.270
- Why do you now live in huts?
- Huts are better.

31:20.440 --> 31:22.210
Caves are dark and wet.

31:22.380 --> 31:25.380
If huts are better,
why did you live in caves?

31:27.550 --> 31:31.920
The most reasonable explanation
would be that at one time,

31:32.090 --> 31:34.290
we did not know how to make huts.

31:34.460 --> 31:40.760
Just as at one time,
you did not know how to weave cloth,

31:40.930 --> 31:42.760
how to make a bow.

31:43.800 --> 31:45.570
That would be reasonable.

31:45.730 --> 31:47.630
Someone invented a hut.

31:47.800 --> 31:51.770
Someone invented a bow,
who taught others,

31:51.940 --> 31:53.940
who taught their children,

31:54.110 --> 31:56.940
who built a stronger hut,
built a better bow,

31:57.110 --> 31:59.210
who taught their children.

32:01.120 --> 32:07.320
Now, Nuria, suppose
one of your cave-dwelling ancestors

32:07.490 --> 32:10.390
were to see you as you are today.

32:10.560 --> 32:13.130
What would she think?

32:14.730 --> 32:19.200
- I don't know.
- Put yourself in her place.

32:19.370 --> 32:23.140
You see, she cannot kill a hornbuck
at a great distance.

32:23.300 --> 32:25.640
You can.
You have a power she lacks.

32:25.810 --> 32:29.210
- Only because I have a bow.
- She has never seen a bow.

32:29.380 --> 32:31.850
It doesn't exist in her world.

32:33.010 --> 32:38.750
To you, it's a simple tool.
To her... it's magic.

32:40.790 --> 32:42.920
I suppose she might think so.

32:43.090 --> 32:45.560
Now, how would she react to you?

32:48.860 --> 32:50.800
I think she would fear me.

32:50.960 --> 32:53.230
Just as you fear me.

32:58.070 --> 33:01.280
- I do not fear you any longer.
- Good.

33:01.440 --> 33:03.380
That's good.

33:03.540 --> 33:05.450
You see...

33:07.150 --> 33:10.050
...my people once lived in caves.

33:10.980 --> 33:14.420
And we then learned to build huts
and, in time,

33:14.590 --> 33:16.920
to build ships, like this one.

33:29.840 --> 33:34.480
Perhaps one day, my people
will travel above the skies.

33:39.180 --> 33:42.520
Of that, I have absolutely no doubt.

33:45.620 --> 33:50.290
It's not the season for lightning.
It must be a warning.

33:50.860 --> 33:53.860
We've had storms like this before.

33:55.900 --> 33:59.170
- Not like this one.
- It must mean something.

33:59.330 --> 34:03.900
The Picard is angry. He blames us
for letting Palmer escape.

34:04.070 --> 34:09.380
We don't know that the Overseer
is responsible for this storm.

34:09.540 --> 34:11.409
Will he send floods?

34:11.580 --> 34:16.380
My wife died in last year's floods.
Will we all die now?

34:18.290 --> 34:20.219
We must find Nuria.

34:32.630 --> 34:38.210
Picard, you have shown me wonders
I could never have imagined.

34:38.370 --> 34:41.040
I am grateful to you beyond words.

34:44.610 --> 34:48.080
Might I request something
for my people?

34:48.949 --> 34:51.050
You are indeed a leader.

34:53.320 --> 34:56.489
You've shown me such generosity.

34:56.659 --> 34:59.260
I wish my people could share in it.

35:01.860 --> 35:05.170
Six Mintakans
died in a flood last winter,

35:05.330 --> 35:07.470
four of them children.

35:07.630 --> 35:10.040
Would you bring them back to life?

35:11.310 --> 35:13.010
That is not in my power.

35:13.170 --> 35:17.380
Why? You restored Liko's life.

35:18.380 --> 35:21.950
Did the six who were killed
offend you in some way?

35:22.120 --> 35:24.020
Did I offend you?

35:24.180 --> 35:27.390
Should I have ordered
the death of Troi?

35:28.490 --> 35:30.220
Please!

35:30.390 --> 35:35.230
You must tell me if there's anything
I can do to change your mind.

35:35.400 --> 35:40.200
I've failed to get through to you,
despite all my efforts.

35:52.850 --> 35:55.950
Nuria can't be found.
No one knows where she is.

35:56.120 --> 35:59.220
Hali, any sign of Palmer or Riker?

35:59.390 --> 36:02.760
They have escaped us.
We searched everywhere.

36:03.920 --> 36:06.390
What do we do now, Father?

36:08.260 --> 36:11.370
We must do as the Picard wishes.

36:14.100 --> 36:16.240
Punish those responsible.

36:16.700 --> 36:19.640
- Nuria would not allow us.
- Nuria isn't here!

36:23.110 --> 36:24.610
We can't wait.

37:04.890 --> 37:08.960
Crusher to Picard.
I think we're going to lose Warren.

37:09.120 --> 37:11.030
On my way.

37:18.770 --> 37:20.270
I'm here, Mary.

37:26.870 --> 37:29.340
Prepare 2cc of norep.

37:44.930 --> 37:46.130
I'm sorry.

38:09.950 --> 38:12.820
Picard, you could not save her?

38:13.820 --> 38:15.460
No.

38:16.190 --> 38:18.290
You do have limits.

38:18.460 --> 38:21.760
You are not masters
of life and death.

38:21.930 --> 38:23.930
No, we're not.

38:25.630 --> 38:27.940
We can cure many diseases,

38:28.100 --> 38:32.310
we can repair injuries,
we can even extend life.

38:33.310 --> 38:37.380
But for all our knowledge,
all our advances...

38:38.610 --> 38:42.120
...we're just as mortal as you are.

38:42.280 --> 38:47.220
We're just as powerless
to prevent the inevitable.

38:50.060 --> 38:53.430
You are a remarkable people.

38:53.590 --> 38:56.430
But you are not superior beings.

38:56.600 --> 39:00.230
My people must be made
to understand that.

39:03.440 --> 39:06.370
Liko, you don't want to kill me.

39:06.540 --> 39:09.540
I have no choice.
I must do as the Picard wishes.

39:09.710 --> 39:12.510
Are you sure you know what he wants?

39:13.610 --> 39:18.120
That's the problem with believing
in a supernatural being.

39:18.250 --> 39:21.220
Trying to determine what he wants.

39:25.890 --> 39:27.800
We must do something.

39:27.960 --> 39:31.030
But what if it's the wrong thing,
Father?

39:36.670 --> 39:39.740
Picard, we need your guidance.

39:40.840 --> 39:44.810
Is it your wish
that this woman should die?

39:44.950 --> 39:48.580
Answer us. Speak.

39:48.750 --> 39:50.320
Liko!

39:51.950 --> 39:53.250
The Picard.

39:53.990 --> 39:56.420
The Overseer has come.

39:56.590 --> 39:58.130
No. Liko.

39:59.290 --> 40:02.860
Liko, I am a man.
I am not the Overseer.

40:03.030 --> 40:06.800
I am a traveler from a faraway land.

40:06.970 --> 40:09.970
- Nothing more.
- But you restored my life.

40:10.140 --> 40:12.970
I am your servant.

40:13.110 --> 40:15.180
You are nobody's servant.

40:15.340 --> 40:18.650
I neither desire your obedience
nor your worship.

40:18.810 --> 40:20.650
Picard speaks the truth.

40:20.810 --> 40:26.490
I have visited his people.
I have seen how they live and die.

40:26.650 --> 40:31.030
When death takes their loved ones,
they are as helpless as we are.

40:31.190 --> 40:35.430
Then how was I brought back to life?

40:35.600 --> 40:37.500
Liko, you were not dead.

40:37.600 --> 40:40.830
Picard's people
have a knowledge that we lack.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.340
They can heal wounds
that we cannot.

40:43.500 --> 40:48.840
No! He can bring back the dead.
Show them, Picard.

40:49.010 --> 40:51.880
You can bring back my wife to me.

40:52.610 --> 40:55.720
- I cannot.
- Why?

40:55.850 --> 40:59.850
Why won't you do this for me?
Have I failed you in some way?

41:00.020 --> 41:02.290
- Are you angry with me?
- No, I'm not.

41:02.460 --> 41:05.160
Then I beg you,
bring her back to me!

41:05.290 --> 41:09.230
I will give you my life in exchange.
Please!

41:09.400 --> 41:11.430
Take back what you gave me.

41:11.570 --> 41:15.170
- Give it to her. Let her live.
- It is beyond my power.

41:15.340 --> 41:17.140
Nothing is beyond your power!

41:17.270 --> 41:20.310
You are the Overseer.
I will prove it!

41:24.450 --> 41:25.780
Liko!

41:25.950 --> 41:29.980
If you believe I am all-powerful,
then you cannot hurt me.

41:32.090 --> 41:35.160
lf, however,
I am telling the truth...

41:37.020 --> 41:42.360
...and I am mortal, you will kill me.

41:43.600 --> 41:48.200
But if the only proof
you will believe is my death...

41:49.340 --> 41:50.700
...then shoot.

41:50.870 --> 41:53.410
- Liko, don't do it!
- Father, no!

42:15.530 --> 42:17.530
Captain's log, supplemental.

42:17.700 --> 42:21.440
Dr Crusher has repaired my injury
with her usual skill.

42:21.600 --> 42:25.610
Mr La Forge will supervise the
dismantling of the observation post,

42:25.770 --> 42:28.580
after I make one last visit
to Mintaka III.

42:30.710 --> 42:32.680
- Now, Mr La Forge.
- Aye, sir.

42:38.790 --> 42:40.420
What is that?

42:40.590 --> 42:44.790
It is a place
where we can watch your people.

42:44.930 --> 42:46.390
But why?

42:46.490 --> 42:49.560
To study you.
To understand your ways.

42:49.730 --> 42:51.830
Continue, Mr La Forge.

42:56.900 --> 43:01.340
Why would a people so advanced
want to learn about us?

43:01.510 --> 43:03.810
We were once as you are now.

43:03.980 --> 43:07.480
To study you
is to understand ourselves.

43:07.650 --> 43:10.420
But why did you have to hide from us?

43:10.580 --> 43:13.690
Because their presence
would affect us,

43:13.850 --> 43:16.290
just as it affected me.

43:16.460 --> 43:20.530
It is our highest law
not to interfere with other cultures.

43:20.690 --> 43:23.130
Revealing yourself was an accident?

43:23.300 --> 43:27.400
Yes. And now we must leave you.

43:27.570 --> 43:30.140
Why? There's so much
you can teach us.

43:30.300 --> 43:33.210
That, too, would be interference.

43:34.480 --> 43:38.010
You must progress in your own way.

43:39.650 --> 43:44.220
So we will. You have taught us
there is nothing beyond our reach.

43:44.350 --> 43:46.650
Not even the stars.

43:47.250 --> 43:48.690
Pahkee?

44:06.570 --> 44:09.710
I wish you good journeys, Picard.

44:10.440 --> 44:12.380
Remember my people.

44:14.550 --> 44:15.980
Always.

44:16.305 --> 44:22.285
