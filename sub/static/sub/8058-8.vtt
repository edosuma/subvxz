WEBVTT

00:00.863 --> 00:03.937
We're gonna have some fun tonight, Pawnee!
[All cheering]

00:04.122 --> 00:06.606
Who is ready to play 60?

00:06.657 --> 00:07.924
Everybody on the field!

00:07.959 --> 00:10.127
Yeah!

00:10.161 --> 00:13.174
The NFL has a campaign
to try to get kids active

00:13.294 --> 00:14.511
for 60 minutes per day.

00:14.562 --> 00:15.946
And so we bused in

00:15.980 --> 00:17.931
a hundred lucky,
little buggers from Pawnee.

00:17.965 --> 00:20.517
And they are gonna get a chance
to play with the Colts.

00:20.551 --> 00:22.302
Oh! Come on, Reggie!

00:22.336 --> 00:23.616
I told you to run a button hook.

00:23.637 --> 00:24.821
- I did, Leslie.
- Okay.

00:24.856 --> 00:25.956
I guess you would know.

00:25.990 --> 00:27.874
A pleasure to see you again,
Mr. Luck.

00:27.908 --> 00:29.125
We met briefly last year

00:29.177 --> 00:31.678
- at our friend's bachelor party.
- Oh, yeah. Right.

00:31.712 --> 00:32.863
How are you?

00:32.897 --> 00:34.080
I normally don't answer
that question,

00:34.115 --> 00:35.699
but since I respect
your talent,

00:35.750 --> 00:38.117
I will tell you--
I am fine.

00:38.135 --> 00:39.102
Hi, I'm April.

00:39.136 --> 00:43.356
I stole your wallet.

00:43.390 --> 00:44.724
You guys are weird.

00:44.742 --> 00:46.960
Thank you.

00:46.994 --> 00:47.961
What's up, girl?

00:47.995 --> 00:50.296
Keep walking, 98.

00:50.314 --> 00:52.115
You don't even want to talk
to that guy?

00:52.149 --> 00:54.601
- He plays for the NFL.
- He's a linebacker.

00:54.619 --> 00:58.221
Skill positions only
for Donna Meagle.

00:58.256 --> 00:59.505
I got my Colts beanie,

00:59.523 --> 01:00.473
my Colts scarf,

01:00.507 --> 01:01.892
I got the Colts grill going,

01:01.943 --> 01:04.411
and the crowning glory--
Colts slippies.

01:04.444 --> 01:06.162
How are you going
to run in those?

01:06.214 --> 01:08.915
[Laughing]
"Run"? Tommy doesn't run.

01:08.949 --> 01:10.217
That's your guys' job.

01:10.251 --> 01:13.320
Now, uh, let's go fetch
this football throw, fellas.

01:15.406 --> 01:16.957
I love sports.

01:16.991 --> 01:19.926
[Triumphant music]

<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

01:37.464 --> 01:39.763
Check it out, Tom--
the Eagleton reservoir.

01:39.797 --> 01:40.830
Isn't it stunning?

01:40.865 --> 01:42.082
It's just a big dumb pond.

01:42.116 --> 01:43.700
This morning I saw
a YouTube clip

01:43.751 --> 01:45.335
of a little puppy riding
a motorcycle.

01:45.369 --> 01:47.103
So my bar for "stunning"
is pretty high.

01:47.138 --> 01:49.889
What if I told you that
this water has fluoride in it?

01:49.923 --> 01:51.908
Then I would tell you
the puppy had a little side car

01:51.943 --> 01:53.693
with a piggy in it
named Hampton.

01:53.727 --> 01:55.912
First of all,
send me a link to that video.

01:55.963 --> 01:58.131
But more importantly,
now that we have access

01:58.149 --> 02:00.767
to the Eagleton reservoir
and the water-treatment supply,

02:00.801 --> 02:02.769
Pawnee is going to have fluoride
in its water

02:02.787 --> 02:04.554
for the first time
in our history,

02:04.588 --> 02:06.139
our oral history.

02:06.173 --> 02:07.440
Nailed it.

02:07.475 --> 02:09.514
Of course I'm upset
that I lost the recall election.

02:09.526 --> 02:12.078
But I'm just gonna spend
the remainder of my term

02:12.112 --> 02:14.848
cramming in as many
good projects as I can.

02:14.882 --> 02:17.183
Lame duck?
Try flame duck...

02:17.217 --> 02:20.086
'cause this duck is on fire.

02:20.121 --> 02:21.538
It's hard doing
stupid government stuff

02:21.589 --> 02:23.006
now that Rent-a-Swag's closed.

02:23.040 --> 02:24.874
I'm a businessman.
That's what I was born to do.

02:24.909 --> 02:27.093
Well, look, you just got
to make the most of the job

02:27.111 --> 02:28.561
that you have.

02:28.595 --> 02:30.263
Like, take that trash collector.

02:30.281 --> 02:31.998
It's not the most glamorous job
in the world,

02:32.033 --> 02:33.917
but he's doing it
with a smile on his face.

02:33.951 --> 02:35.669
Oh, my God.

02:35.703 --> 02:37.971
He's not wearing any pants.
What's wrong with him?

02:38.005 --> 02:39.806
- Let's get out of here.
- He's smiling at us!

02:39.824 --> 02:41.908
- Let's go! Run!
- [Whimpering]

02:41.942 --> 02:43.910
What's so exciting, everyone?

02:43.928 --> 02:45.762
Look what Ron made.
It's amazing.

02:45.813 --> 02:47.847
Several months ago,
I was on a walk

02:47.865 --> 02:49.666
and found my crib tree.

02:49.700 --> 02:52.152
I approached the tree,
murdered it,

02:52.186 --> 02:54.087
left it to cure in my woodshop,

02:54.105 --> 02:55.722
and have begun working it
into a crib

02:55.740 --> 02:57.407
for my upcoming child.

02:57.441 --> 03:00.243
Ron Swanson,
you cannot use this crib.

03:00.294 --> 03:02.545
You're ignoring every known
crib-safety standard.

03:02.596 --> 03:04.264
It's all covered in
the parenting book I'm reading.

03:04.298 --> 03:06.333
Are you going to crawl my way?
By Lenny Kravitz.

03:06.367 --> 03:08.668
My crib will be safe
because I'm building it

03:08.703 --> 03:10.120
with my own two hands.

03:10.171 --> 03:11.588
I bought my crib
in Bloomington,

03:11.639 --> 03:14.190
and I am confident
that it is literally

03:14.241 --> 03:16.443
the safest crib
in the explored universe.

03:16.477 --> 03:17.444
Let me take you there,

03:17.478 --> 03:18.928
and you can talk
to the salesperson.

03:18.963 --> 03:20.096
Counteroffer--

03:20.131 --> 03:22.265
you take me nowhere,
and I talk to no one.

03:22.299 --> 03:23.350
Counter-counteroffer--

03:23.384 --> 03:24.984
you come with me,
or I make you attend

03:25.019 --> 03:26.986
a four-hour fax cover-sheet
protocol meeting.

03:27.004 --> 03:29.806
Either way, it's a win for me.

03:29.840 --> 03:32.776
Next on the docket is
a vote to approve

03:32.810 --> 03:34.861
the Pawnee-Eagleton
reservoir merger.

03:34.895 --> 03:36.246
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

03:36.280 --> 03:39.332
We're just goosing our
water supply with fluoride?

03:39.366 --> 03:40.666
I mean, come on.

03:40.684 --> 03:42.652
Are we really gonna force
every Pawnee resident

03:42.686 --> 03:45.438
to ingest a chemical
we know nothing about?

03:45.473 --> 03:47.573
Fluoride is used
by the communists

03:47.591 --> 03:49.075
to control our minds.

03:49.093 --> 03:50.543
No, it's not.

03:50.561 --> 03:51.861
Fluoride can control minds?

03:51.896 --> 03:54.831
Like, you can use it
to make ladies do stuff?

03:54.865 --> 03:56.545
How am I the one
that is getting booted off

03:56.550 --> 03:57.467
of this city council?

03:57.501 --> 03:59.419
Okay, fluoride is safe,

03:59.437 --> 04:00.720
it is good for you,

04:00.738 --> 04:03.940
and almost every town
in America uses it.

04:03.991 --> 04:05.141
Ah, all right.

04:05.176 --> 04:06.376
You got me.

04:06.427 --> 04:07.877
I don't want fluoride
in the water

04:07.928 --> 04:10.480
because I'm a dentist,
and I like cavities.

04:10.514 --> 04:11.948
Yeah, that is not
a valid reason.

04:11.982 --> 04:13.232
Pawnee's cavity problem

04:13.250 --> 04:15.051
is why a small-town dentist,

04:15.086 --> 04:19.139
like me, can afford
such a boss ride.

04:19.173 --> 04:21.491
Got an Asian girl
to sit in it once.

04:21.524 --> 04:23.760
Why did we come out here?

04:23.794 --> 04:25.244
Come on, Jamm.

04:25.262 --> 04:27.313
Fluoride in the water--
it's a no-brainer.

04:27.348 --> 04:28.681
Can't you just let me
have this one?

04:28.699 --> 04:30.016
No can do, Knopey.

04:30.034 --> 04:32.118
As a matter of fact,
I would like to propose

04:32.152 --> 04:34.838
my own bill--
the Pawnee Clean Water Bill,

04:34.889 --> 04:37.307
which prohibits adding anything

04:37.358 --> 04:40.092
to our water supply forever.

04:40.111 --> 04:41.895
Jamm's not going to be able

04:41.929 --> 04:44.297
to kill this reservoir merger,
is he?

04:44.331 --> 04:46.866
On my side, I have facts,
science, and reason.

04:46.901 --> 04:48.334
All he has
is fear-mongering.

04:48.352 --> 04:50.236
Oh, my God, he's gonna win.

04:50.271 --> 04:52.638
Yeah, people get jittery
about stuff like this.

04:52.656 --> 04:54.791
Remember last year
when no one would get flu shots

04:54.825 --> 04:57.210
'cause there was a rumor
they turned you European?

04:57.244 --> 04:58.711
Well,
I'll figure something out.

04:58.729 --> 05:00.146
Oh, Jessica's here.
I better go.

05:00.181 --> 05:02.015
- Okay, bye.
- Hey, sugar butt.

05:02.049 --> 05:05.652
Some lardos in Muncie ate
tainted Sweetums toffee sticks

05:05.686 --> 05:08.471
and diarrhea'd so much,
they ended up in the hospital.

05:08.506 --> 05:09.472
Ugh.

05:09.507 --> 05:10.640
Can we give their school,

05:10.691 --> 05:12.592
like, a new seesaw
or something?

05:12.610 --> 05:13.593
Yeah.

05:13.611 --> 05:15.728
Thanks.

05:15.746 --> 05:18.164
The new site looks good.
Nice work.

05:18.198 --> 05:20.233
Oh, my God.
These dogs are so cute.

05:20.267 --> 05:22.168
I want to throw up
and kill myself.

05:22.186 --> 05:25.438
Animal control had to take in
all the pets from Eagleton.

05:25.472 --> 05:27.657
And Crazy Craig used to run
all their shelters,

05:27.708 --> 05:29.542
so he helped me make
an adoption website

05:29.576 --> 05:30.576
for all the dogs.

05:30.594 --> 05:31.878
If you can look at that site

05:31.896 --> 05:33.217
and not want to take home
50 dogs,

05:33.230 --> 05:35.932
you're basically
a war criminal.

05:35.983 --> 05:37.033
[Groans]

05:37.067 --> 05:38.034
See the way that dog

05:38.085 --> 05:39.318
is rolling around in a puddle?

05:39.336 --> 05:41.588
That's something Andy does
when he gets hot.

05:41.622 --> 05:42.955
Oh, my God, you're right.

05:42.973 --> 05:44.023
That is so Andy.

05:44.058 --> 05:45.424
Oh, my God.
That dog is totally...

05:45.442 --> 05:46.776
Both: Tom!

05:46.810 --> 05:48.027
I don't know why.
It doesn't look like him.

05:48.061 --> 05:49.462
But it just is.

05:49.497 --> 05:50.863
It's like the dog is
the essence of Tom.

05:50.881 --> 05:52.382
[Gasps]
Okay, important meeting

05:52.433 --> 05:53.800
in the conference room
right now.

05:53.834 --> 05:56.335
We are going to all pick
our spirit dogs.

05:56.353 --> 05:57.987
Oh, I've got to pick up Gayle
at the airport.

05:58.022 --> 05:59.605
Larry, I swear to God,

05:59.623 --> 06:01.274
if you leave right now,
we will make your spirit dog

06:01.292 --> 06:02.825
a miniature schnauzer.

06:02.877 --> 06:04.427
- Is that bad?
- Yes!

06:04.461 --> 06:06.062
Get in there!

06:06.096 --> 06:08.231
Ann found this place.

06:08.265 --> 06:10.033
It's where we bought
our "Sounds of Nature" machine.

06:10.067 --> 06:12.652
You bought a machine
that replicates

06:12.686 --> 06:14.320
an open window?

06:14.354 --> 06:15.321
Frasier!
Chris Traeger.

06:15.339 --> 06:16.506
Do you remember me?

06:16.540 --> 06:17.957
I came in here looking
for the Vanna White book

06:17.991 --> 06:19.325
on child care--

06:19.343 --> 06:21.961
<i>I'd like to solve the puzzle</i>
<i>of parenting.</i>

06:21.995 --> 06:23.029
Could you show my friend, Ron,

06:23.063 --> 06:24.631
that amazing crib
that you sold me?

06:24.665 --> 06:27.066
The Babylove L'il Sweetheart
Safe 4 Ever and Ever model.

06:27.100 --> 06:28.751
Oh, yeah,
that thing is a deathtrap.

06:28.786 --> 06:30.403
- I'm sorry?
- Just found out this morning--

06:30.421 --> 06:31.538
it's being recalled.

06:31.572 --> 06:33.406
They found maxicylofentabol
in the glue.

06:33.424 --> 06:34.641
Is that good?
It sounds bad.

06:34.675 --> 06:36.726
It burned off my fingernails.

06:36.760 --> 06:40.029
I'll be in the car.

06:40.064 --> 06:43.666
Councilwoman Leslie Knope
wants to put fluoride,

06:43.701 --> 06:46.119
which is a chemical,
into your drinking water.

06:46.153 --> 06:47.720
You know what else is
a chemical?

06:47.755 --> 06:50.006
Strychnine and cyanide.

06:50.057 --> 06:51.123
- What?
- And dirt...

06:51.141 --> 06:53.626
and rust and even broken glass.

06:53.644 --> 06:55.194
Exactly.

06:55.229 --> 06:56.779
You definitely understand
what chemicals are, Perd.

06:56.814 --> 06:59.966
I would suggest if you want
to contact the psychopath

07:00.000 --> 07:02.785
that wants to turn your kids
into bad-at-math,

07:02.820 --> 07:04.954
communist fluoride zombies,

07:04.989 --> 07:06.856
well, just call the number

07:09.994 --> 07:11.878
Stop right there.
You know what?

07:11.912 --> 07:12.962
Fluoride protects your teeth,

07:12.997 --> 07:14.831
and it's perfectly healthy
for you.

07:14.882 --> 07:17.283
Well, if Jamm says that,
then he is a lying idiot,

07:17.301 --> 07:19.836
and if you believe it,
then so are you.

07:19.887 --> 07:21.137
[Phone receiver thuds]
Whoa.

07:21.171 --> 07:22.972
You just talked to that person
like I talk to you.

07:23.007 --> 07:24.140
- You can't do that.
- Why not?

07:24.174 --> 07:27.510
What are they gonna do,
kick me out of office?

07:27.561 --> 07:29.095
Why did it take me so long
to realize this?

07:29.129 --> 07:31.464
There are no consequences
to my actions anymore.

07:31.482 --> 07:34.467
No matter what I do, literally
nothing bad can happen to me.

07:34.485 --> 07:36.436
I'm like
a white, male U.S. senator.

07:36.470 --> 07:38.104
[Phone rings]

07:38.138 --> 07:41.407
Fluoride is going
into the water, moron.

07:41.442 --> 07:44.477
Oh. Hey, mom.
Sorry.

07:44.495 --> 07:46.913
Because all it does
is prevent cavities!

07:46.947 --> 07:48.448
God!

16:13.313 --> 16:14.763
It's unstable.
It's no good.

16:14.781 --> 16:16.231
I just don't understand

16:16.249 --> 16:18.233
"the throwing away the wood"
metaphor.

16:18.251 --> 16:19.701
What's the lesson?

16:19.719 --> 16:22.088
Oh, I know!
It's potty-training.

16:22.139 --> 16:24.706
That trash can is the toilet,
and the wood was the feces.

16:24.724 --> 16:26.692
Chris, I'm not teaching you
anything.

16:26.726 --> 16:28.027
We're just building a crib.

16:28.061 --> 16:29.278
No, I know you're not

16:29.312 --> 16:30.863
consciously teaching me
anything.

16:30.914 --> 16:32.348
I'm trying to siphon off

16:32.382 --> 16:34.350
some of your calm,
centered wisdom

16:34.384 --> 16:35.384
through metaphors.

16:35.418 --> 16:36.385
Metaphors?

16:36.403 --> 16:37.820
I hate metaphors.

16:37.854 --> 16:39.822
That's why my favorite book is
<i>Moby Dick--</i>

16:39.856 --> 16:41.907
no froufrou symbolism,

16:41.942 --> 16:44.993
just a good, simple tale
about a man who hates an animal.

16:45.011 --> 16:49.315
That's enough for today,
I think.

16:49.349 --> 16:53.752
- An organized child is a--
- No.

16:53.787 --> 16:56.422
[Sighs] Okay, I've been
working on this for three hours,

16:56.473 --> 16:58.858
and I know your spirit dog.

16:58.892 --> 17:01.861
You are a Nova Scotia toller,

17:01.895 --> 17:05.998
because you're
outgoing and adventurous.

17:06.031 --> 17:08.851
And you love Canada?

17:08.885 --> 17:11.252
- No, that's not right.
- No, it isn't.

17:11.271 --> 17:12.605
But I appreciate the effort.

17:12.638 --> 17:13.606
We're good.

17:13.656 --> 17:14.990
And don't beat yourself up.

17:15.025 --> 17:17.159
You'll probably never guess
what kind of dog I am.

17:17.194 --> 17:19.474
You're right. I'll never guess
what kind of dog you are,

17:19.496 --> 17:20.695
because you're not a dog.

17:20.714 --> 17:21.763
You're a cat.

17:21.798 --> 17:23.516
You're temperamental.

17:23.550 --> 17:26.852
You're unpredictable, complex,
and hard to read.

17:26.887 --> 17:29.655
You make people work
before you let them in.

17:29.689 --> 17:32.458
But if they put the time in
and prove that they care,

17:32.492 --> 17:34.143
then you open yourself up
to them.

17:34.177 --> 17:36.128
Right?

17:38.014 --> 17:41.383
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

17:41.401 --> 17:44.170
Hmm.
[Purrs]

17:44.204 --> 17:46.205
"So let's all raise a glass,

17:46.239 --> 17:48.541
"full of delicious,
sugary drinking water,

17:48.575 --> 17:51.193
to Sweetums--
a Pawnee Institution."

17:51.211 --> 17:52.928
Leslie, don't do this.

17:52.963 --> 17:55.848
I have to, Ben.
We can't both be out of a job.

17:55.882 --> 17:58.050
What will we do--
sleep all day,

17:58.101 --> 17:59.718
take cooking classes together,

17:59.769 --> 18:02.188
sit on a couch
and watch movies?

18:02.222 --> 18:04.840
- God, that sounds horrible.
- There's more at stake here.

18:04.858 --> 18:07.142
I mean, you apologize,
it'll be an endorsement

18:07.176 --> 18:08.694
- for the Drink-ems plan.
- I know that, but--

18:08.728 --> 18:11.363
And everything you said
about Sweetums was right on.

18:11.398 --> 18:14.033
I mean, 90%
of the charity work I did

18:14.067 --> 18:16.402
was to compensate
for messes they caused.

18:16.453 --> 18:18.904
And I don't want to work
for them anymore.

18:18.955 --> 18:20.139
Are you sure?

18:20.173 --> 18:22.958
Yeah, just go up there,
stick to your guns.

18:22.993 --> 18:24.293
It's not gonna make
a difference.

18:24.327 --> 18:25.377
I can't beat them.

18:25.412 --> 18:27.713
All I have on my side is
facts and science,

18:27.747 --> 18:29.832
and people hate
facts and science.

18:29.866 --> 18:32.001
Wait.
I have an idea.

18:32.035 --> 18:34.253
Go get Tom.
Run! Get Tom!

18:36.098 --> 18:38.537
Yesterday I said some pretty harsh things

18:38.657 --> 18:41.826
about Sweetums
and their great new product.

18:41.946 --> 18:43.397
But when I looked
at the research,

18:43.431 --> 18:46.199
I found some pretty compelling
facts about Drink-ems

18:46.234 --> 18:48.035
that made me change my tune.

18:48.069 --> 18:50.988
Each Drink-ems is packed
with 35%

18:51.022 --> 18:54.041
of your daily monopotassium
phosphate requirement.

18:54.075 --> 18:58.328
MPP is an emulsifier as well
as a plus-7 PH buffer.

18:58.379 --> 18:59.880
Now, I know
what you're thinking--

18:59.914 --> 19:01.048
what about its molar mass?

19:01.082 --> 19:04.251
How does 136.086 grab you?

19:04.285 --> 19:06.837
[Hip-hop beat]
What the--

19:06.888 --> 19:08.805
I don't know about y'all,

19:08.840 --> 19:10.674
but Drink-ems seems
pretty boring to me,

19:10.725 --> 19:13.226
not like H-2-flow.

19:13.261 --> 19:14.511
Excuse me.

19:14.562 --> 19:16.296
I have several binders
with very important data

19:16.314 --> 19:17.597
that I need to get through.

19:17.631 --> 19:19.271
Well, miss, I think
we'd all appreciate it

19:19.300 --> 19:21.184
if you just swallowed
a teaspoon of hush.

19:21.235 --> 19:24.071
Think of H-2-flow
as an app for your teeth.

19:24.105 --> 19:27.190
The more flow you take in,
the more sparkle points you get.

19:27.241 --> 19:28.525
Get enough sparkle points,

19:28.576 --> 19:30.193
and you're on your way
to your first aqua badge!

19:30.228 --> 19:31.611
Collect enough aqua badges,

19:31.645 --> 19:36.533
and we'll welcome you
to the H-2-flow Platinum Club.

19:36.584 --> 19:39.086
I'm great at business,
and I'm great at parks stuff.

19:39.120 --> 19:40.921
I'm like Picasso meets
Michael Jordan.

19:40.955 --> 19:42.122
I can paint,

19:42.156 --> 19:45.092
but, uh, I can also be
a world-class gambler.

19:45.126 --> 19:47.044
Ron, what's this?

19:47.095 --> 19:48.879
The crib I built.

19:48.930 --> 19:50.597
I'm giving it to you and Ann.

19:50.631 --> 19:51.815
It's perfectly safe.

19:51.849 --> 19:54.317
I tested it by hitting it
with my truck.

19:54.352 --> 19:55.635
Well, Ron, I can't accept.

19:55.669 --> 19:57.337
This is for your baby.

19:57.355 --> 19:59.156
There's more than
one crib tree in a forest.

19:59.173 --> 20:00.673
That's not a lesson,
by the way,

20:00.692 --> 20:03.310
just a comment
on lumber availability.

20:03.344 --> 20:05.845
It's beautiful.
Thank you.

20:05.863 --> 20:07.864
Nobody has
all the right answers

20:07.899 --> 20:09.516
in parenting, including me.

20:09.534 --> 20:11.318
And that toxic crib you bought

20:11.352 --> 20:12.953
won't be the last mistake
you make.

20:12.987 --> 20:14.521
But a man who's this worried

20:14.539 --> 20:16.323
about making
all the right choices

20:16.357 --> 20:17.958
cares very much.

20:17.992 --> 20:19.859
That's all that matters.

20:19.877 --> 20:21.962
You'll be a great father.

20:21.996 --> 20:23.296
Thank you, Ron...

20:23.331 --> 20:25.132
for the crib and the advice.

20:25.252 --> 20:28.201
It's much better
than any metaphor.

20:28.219 --> 20:30.921
Does the white whale
actually symbolize

20:30.972 --> 20:33.340
the unknowability
and meaninglessness

20:33.374 --> 20:35.258
of human existence?

20:35.309 --> 20:37.094
[Chuckles] No.

20:37.145 --> 20:39.479
It's just a [bleep] fish.

20:39.514 --> 20:41.398
Hey, good news.

20:41.432 --> 20:42.549
Drink-ems is dead.

20:42.567 --> 20:44.784
As of tomorrow,
every Pawnee resident

20:44.802 --> 20:47.220
will have H-2-flow
in their drinking water.

20:47.255 --> 20:48.288
That's great news.

20:48.306 --> 20:50.424
H-2-flow is fluoride, right?

20:50.458 --> 20:52.476
I think so.

20:52.510 --> 20:55.562
I'll double-check with Tom,
but I'm, like, 95% sure.

20:55.596 --> 20:56.763
Wow.
Look at us.

20:56.797 --> 20:59.316
Two people, who are about
to have zero jobs.

20:59.350 --> 21:00.400
Weird, huh?

21:00.435 --> 21:01.435
And you and I--

21:01.469 --> 21:03.403
we always land
on our feet, right?

21:03.438 --> 21:04.905
- Yeah.
- Uh-oh!

21:04.939 --> 21:07.691
Guess who won
that plain blue T-shirt?

21:07.742 --> 21:08.859
No way!

21:08.910 --> 21:09.976
Look how blue it is.

21:09.994 --> 21:11.596
Wow. Things are
already looking up.

21:11.716 --> 21:13.119
Yeah!

21:13.239 --> 21:15.159
