02:21.675 --> 02:23.909
Yeah, well,
I told you not to smoke.

02:23.911 --> 02:25.410
I thought you just
meant crack.

02:25.412 --> 02:27.779
No, I meant cigarettes too.

02:27.781 --> 02:30.382
At your age,
you should just be vaping.

02:30.384 --> 02:32.384
Push.
Where's Mum?

02:32.386 --> 02:34.286
She's still in
the furniture store.

02:34.288 --> 02:36.221
Hey, Dad,
let's put it in here.

02:36.223 --> 02:39.191
No. That is me brother's room.

02:39.193 --> 02:41.793
But, Dad, he's been missing
for 28 years.

02:41.795 --> 02:44.796
We need the room.
There's nine of us.

02:44.798 --> 02:47.332
No. I'm keeping it
the way he likes it.

02:48.903 --> 02:51.336
Though when he comes back,
I will have to break it to him

02:51.338 --> 02:53.739
that some of his childhood
heroes didn't love women

02:53.741 --> 02:55.941
as much as we thought
they did.

02:59.914 --> 03:02.948
And one of them liked them
a little too much.

03:08.722 --> 03:11.256
Dad, you're never
gonna find him.

03:11.258 --> 03:12.758
You might as well just give up.

03:12.760 --> 03:14.226
Give up?

03:14.228 --> 03:16.094
I know he's out there
somewhere.

03:16.096 --> 03:18.297
And one day,

03:18.299 --> 03:22.467
he's gonna join
our family again.

03:33.747 --> 03:34.980
Green Earth.

03:47.561 --> 03:51.396
Agent Graves,
your feed is live.

03:51.398 --> 03:54.900
The target is Maelstrom's
second in command.

03:56.136 --> 03:58.303
He has information
we must extract.

03:59.640 --> 04:02.407
<i>Capture and interrogate.

04:09.650 --> 04:12.918
Interception in nine, eight,

<i>Be advised,

05:05.572 --> 05:07.439
Alpha 1's now Bravo 1.

05:07.441 --> 05:09.161
He's mobile.
<i>Roger that.</i>

05:10.577 --> 05:13.378
Out of the way.
Move, move, move.

05:13.380 --> 05:15.547
May I borrow this?
Thank you.

05:15.549 --> 05:18.317
Now complete on Bravo 1,
following Bravo 1.

05:29.663 --> 05:32.297

<i>Hostiles to your south,</i>

<i>Bravo 1 is now mobile.
He has backup. End pursuit now.</i>

05:40.207 --> 05:42.474
I'd rather not.

05:44.745 --> 05:46.778
Come on. My gun!

<i>Permission to abort now.
Commander, acknowledge.</i>

06:29.123 --> 06:30.989
Goodbye.

06:33.827 --> 06:35.560
Buckle up!

07:00.888 --> 07:02.521

07:04.057 --> 07:07.692
You have 90 seconds
until heart failure.

07:07.694 --> 07:10.128
I do, however,
have the antidote here.

07:10.130 --> 07:11.730
Perhaps you'd like
to tell me what your friends

07:11.732 --> 07:13.565
at the Maelstrom Syndicate
are planning.

07:13.567 --> 07:15.600
Sixty seconds.

07:17.337 --> 07:19.037
Rhonda George.

07:19.039 --> 07:21.706
An assassination.
Rhonda George?

07:21.708 --> 07:23.842
She's the actress
and philanthropist.

07:23.844 --> 07:27.312
She's hosting an event
for WorldCure in two days, sir.

07:27.314 --> 07:29.414
Give me the antidote.

07:29.416 --> 07:31.176
It's too late,
I'm afraid.

07:33.587 --> 07:35.987
I want you at this event,
Sebastian.

07:35.989 --> 07:38.323
Very wise,
Commander Ledford.

07:44.164 --> 07:47.466
<i>Welbeck's touch.

Where's Nobby? Nobby!

08:59.673 --> 09:02.040
Nobby. Nobby, Nobby.

09:03.110 --> 09:05.644
Why are you
so out of breath?

09:05.646 --> 09:06.945
I've run all the way
from home.

09:06.947 --> 09:09.781
But you only live
across the street.

09:09.783 --> 09:11.349
Do you remember me cousin,
Digger?

09:11.351 --> 09:12.918
What, the thief?
Yeah.

09:12.920 --> 09:15.487
Well, he was nicking coats
at a posh event the other night,

09:15.489 --> 09:16.855
and you'll never guess
who he saw.

09:16.857 --> 09:18.823
Who?
We finally found him.

09:18.825 --> 09:21.793
We finally found

09:31.738 --> 09:33.805
<i>Nobby and Sebastian Butcher.</i>

<i>They'll never split us up.</i>

<i>Your brother is gonna be

09:43.750 --> 09:45.283
<i>But how will I get in?</i>

09:45.285 --> 09:48.320
<i>Me cousin's

<i>And stop flirting.

<i>Right.</i>

10:44.578 --> 10:46.344
How now?

10:46.346 --> 10:48.980
Hi.

10:48.982 --> 10:51.049
Have you seen me brother?
He's called Sebastian.

10:51.051 --> 10:54.352
Here's a photo of him.
It was taken a few years ago.

10:55.922 --> 10:58.423
<i>Are you in position yet,
Agent Graves?</i>

11:16.510 --> 11:18.376
Uh-oh.

Come on. It's stuck.

11:29.623 --> 11:31.156
Come on.

11:34.795 --> 11:36.761
Please welcome Rhonda George.

11:42.235 --> 11:44.636
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

11:44.638 --> 11:46.004
Thank you.

11:46.006 --> 11:47.839
When I started WorldCure,

11:47.841 --> 11:50.308
people would constantly
say to me:

11:50.310 --> 11:53.211
"You cannot rid the world
of disease."

11:53.213 --> 11:55.413
I would look them
straight in the eye

11:55.415 --> 11:58.083
and say, "Yes, I can."

12:02.422 --> 12:04.823
Can you detect
any imminent threat, Graves?

12:04.825 --> 12:07.058
We are gonna figure this out.

12:07.060 --> 12:09.594
And it all starts right here,
right now,

12:09.596 --> 12:10.829
with one little boy.

12:10.831 --> 12:13.064
His name is Schlomo Khalidi.

12:13.066 --> 12:16.601
Ladies and gentlemen,
we will cure the world.

12:25.345 --> 12:26.845
Mummy was Jewish.

12:26.847 --> 12:29.013
Daddy was Palestinian.

12:29.015 --> 12:31.449
But they both loved each other
so very much.

12:37.924 --> 12:39.758
I was born with HIV.

12:39.760 --> 12:41.626
Now I am very sick with AIDS.

12:41.628 --> 12:44.796
Yes! Fantastic!

12:44.798 --> 12:47.298
You are not
coming back from that!

12:47.300 --> 12:49.601
Shh!

12:49.603 --> 12:51.770
Though this
disease may kill me...

12:51.772 --> 12:53.204
The operator.
...why can't we stop

12:53.206 --> 12:55.306
killing each other
in the Middle East?

12:55.308 --> 12:57.075
Where's the operator?

13:04.484 --> 13:06.384
The camera's a gun.

13:12.526 --> 13:15.193
Damn. The camera's a gun!

13:39.553 --> 13:41.386
Who are you?

13:41.388 --> 13:42.687
It's me.

13:42.689 --> 13:44.088

15:30.230 --> 15:32.897
Aah! My ankle!

15:32.899 --> 15:35.967
Get off me!
Come on.

15:35.969 --> 15:38.169

You'll need to carry me.

15:49.282 --> 15:50.481

15:50.483 --> 15:51.950
You'll have to drive.

15:51.952 --> 15:54.485
Move. Not that one!

15:57.557 --> 15:58.756
What happened?

15:58.758 --> 16:00.325
Never mind.
Just get going.

16:01.594 --> 16:03.061
Come on, it's dangerous!

16:03.063 --> 16:04.529
Get out of the car now!

16:04.531 --> 16:06.397
Don't worry.

16:06.399 --> 16:08.733
You can't hurt us.

16:33.560 --> 16:36.461
Oh, great. We can watch
the match while escaping.

16:39.099 --> 16:41.366
Watch out!

16:41.368 --> 16:43.234
Aah!

16:50.243 --> 16:52.377
<i>He's gonna take the penalty.</i>

16:52.379 --> 16:54.445
There's a penalty.
Nobby, forget the football.

16:54.447 --> 16:56.347
You're gonna drown.
I'm getting out

16:56.349 --> 16:58.149
after he's taken penalty.
Listen to me.

16:58.151 --> 17:00.018
Miss it!
Take a breath.

17:00.020 --> 17:01.552
<i>And he...</i>

17:03.523 --> 17:05.656
Fuck!

17:17.670 --> 17:20.972
<i>Director General of
the World Health Organization,</i>

17:20.973 --> 17:22.707
<i>Dr. Javier Alvarez,</i>

17:22.709 --> 17:24.008
<i>is dead.</i>

17:24.010 --> 17:25.675
<i>He was caught
in the crossfire</i>

17:25.678 --> 17:28.479
<i>of an apparent
assassination attempt</i>

17:28.481 --> 17:30.448
<i>on philanthropist
Rhonda George.</i>

17:30.450 --> 17:32.850
<i>A huge manhunt is underway</i>

17:32.852 --> 17:34.919
<i>to find a rogue secret agent</i>

17:34.921 --> 17:37.789
<i>who first shot Middle East
peace symbol</i>

17:37.791 --> 17:39.590
<i>Schlomo Khalidi.</i>

17:39.592 --> 17:42.527
<i>The boy's AIDS-tainted blood
then sprayed into the mouth</i>

17:42.529 --> 17:45.963
<i>of</i> Harry Potter <i> star</i>
<i>Daniel Radcliffe.</i>

17:45.965 --> 17:47.465
<i>Sources tell us
that Radcliffe,</i>

17:47.467 --> 17:49.300
<i>who had numerous open sores
in his mouth,</i>

17:49.302 --> 17:52.336
<i>has tested positive for HIV.</i>

17:52.338 --> 17:54.505
We're digging
into his background now, sir.

17:54.507 --> 17:57.341
Trying to work out how
Maelstrom could've got to him.

17:57.343 --> 18:00.845
What do you want us
to do, sir?

18:02.348 --> 18:04.449
Activate Chilcott.

18:04.451 --> 18:07.118
Chilcott was dismissed
for good reason, sir.

18:07.120 --> 18:09.854
Activate Chilcott.

18:11.925 --> 18:14.225
Isn't life strange?

18:14.227 --> 18:15.827
I mean, yesterday
I'm having a normal day

18:15.829 --> 18:18.329
down the pub with me mates
with a firework up me ass.

18:18.331 --> 18:20.698
And here we are now,
with me brother,

18:20.700 --> 18:22.600
doing some running
and swimming,

18:22.602 --> 18:24.442
all different types
of cardio.

18:28.808 --> 18:30.274
Can I ask you a question?

18:30.276 --> 18:32.777
Are you a Vin Diesel
impersonator?

18:32.779 --> 18:35.780
Or are you a hit man who
specializes in kids with AIDS?

18:35.782 --> 18:39.050
What? I'm a secret agent,
I work for an offshoot of MI6.

18:39.052 --> 18:41.652
How could you not tell
your own brother what you do?

18:41.654 --> 18:44.388
Because within the title of my
occupation is the word "secret."

18:44.390 --> 18:46.424
But if you can't trust family,
who can you trust?

18:46.426 --> 18:50.495
Trust you? Trust you?
Because of you,

18:50.497 --> 18:52.763
the head of the World
Health Organization is dead

18:52.765 --> 18:54.298
and Harry Potter has AIDS.

18:54.300 --> 18:56.601
You managed to do in
three seconds

18:56.603 --> 19:00.104
what Voldemort failed to do
in eight movies.

19:00.106 --> 19:03.541
Don't wet your knickers.
It's treatable.

19:03.543 --> 19:05.309
Ooh, heroin.

19:05.311 --> 19:08.579
That stuff's addictive.
It's a gateway drug.

19:08.581 --> 19:11.315
To what?
To more heroin.

19:11.317 --> 19:14.418
This is not heroin,
this is rapid bone calcifier.

19:14.420 --> 19:16.020
It fills the fractures
in my ankle,

19:16.022 --> 19:19.557
hardens the bone and muscle
around it so that I can walk.

19:19.559 --> 19:21.926
Why, what happened
to your ankle?

19:21.928 --> 19:23.294
You fell on it.

19:26.966 --> 19:28.166
Hello.

19:28.168 --> 19:29.400
<i>I didn't do it.</i>

19:29.402 --> 19:30.601
<i>I need your help.</i>

19:30.603 --> 19:33.037
If I help you, I'll be arrested.

19:33.039 --> 19:35.273
If you don't, I could be dead
by the end of the day.

19:35.275 --> 19:37.775
All right, listen.

19:37.777 --> 19:40.211
Ledford activated someone
called Chil-something.

19:40.213 --> 19:41.646
That's all I know.

19:41.648 --> 19:44.315
Chilcott?
Oh, Jesus, he's a psychopath.

19:44.317 --> 19:46.350
That's a kill order.
Oh, God.

19:46.352 --> 19:48.486
Jodie, I need you
to do something for me.

19:48.488 --> 19:50.354
I need you to find out
the identity of the man

19:50.356 --> 19:51.989
who killed Javier Alvarez.

19:51.991 --> 19:54.425
<i>If I can find him,
it will clear my name.</i>

19:54.427 --> 19:56.093
<i>Can you do that?</i>

19:56.095 --> 19:58.529
I'll try.

20:00.066 --> 20:01.599
Seb, can I press
this red button?

20:01.601 --> 20:04.368
Aah! God's sake.
What?

20:04.370 --> 20:06.637
You just implanted
a tracking device in my neck!

20:06.639 --> 20:12.109
At least I won't lose you
for another 28 years.

20:12.111 --> 20:14.679
I forgot to mention,
I got you a present.

20:14.681 --> 20:18.015
What?
Two tickets for me and you

20:18.017 --> 20:22.653
to go to Chile to see England
play in the final.

20:22.655 --> 20:24.789
How do you know if England
are gonna be in the final?

20:24.791 --> 20:27.458
Well, they'd better be
because I just got this done.

20:27.460 --> 20:33.764
England, World "Championes,"
2016.

20:33.766 --> 20:36.367
That says 200,016.

20:36.369 --> 20:39.737
No, it says 2016.

20:39.739 --> 20:42.873
That's 198,000 years
from now.

20:42.875 --> 20:45.977
In that case, I got two zeroes
for free, so who's the idiot?

20:47.247 --> 20:49.413
What are you doing?
I need to disappear.

20:49.415 --> 20:51.015
There are people
looking for me.

20:51.017 --> 20:52.984
You won't see me again.

20:55.922 --> 20:57.655
Good luck, Nobby.

20:57.657 --> 20:59.624
Yeah.

20:59.626 --> 21:01.425
Okay. No, no, you're right.

21:01.427 --> 21:04.295
I should... I should be
heading back home anyway.

21:04.297 --> 21:06.163
Got to see the family.

21:06.165 --> 21:08.199
It's good to reconnect.

21:08.201 --> 21:09.700
Take care, eh?

21:09.702 --> 21:11.435
Take care.

21:18.344 --> 21:19.810
Wait. Since you're a spy,

21:19.812 --> 21:22.546
does that mean no one knows
I'm your brother?

21:22.548 --> 21:24.649
Exactly.

21:26.986 --> 21:31.756
Well, then, I've got the perfect
place for you to hide.

21:34.327 --> 21:36.294
Oh, no.

21:42.268 --> 21:44.802
Oh, it's so good

21:44.804 --> 21:46.570
to have you back
in Grimsby.

21:46.572 --> 21:49.173
You probably don't recognize it
since it were gentrified.

21:49.175 --> 21:51.876
I am not from Grimsby.

21:51.878 --> 21:53.377
Hiya.

21:53.379 --> 21:54.912
Hiya.

21:54.914 --> 21:58.549
I've got a girlfriend.
It's nothing serious.

21:58.551 --> 22:01.519
But she's fit as fuck,
so hands to yourself.

22:01.521 --> 22:03.721
Go on. Shoes off.

22:06.225 --> 22:07.792
Hey.

22:07.794 --> 22:09.560
Missed you, Dad.
Missed you too.

22:12.231 --> 22:15.366
Was I not clear when I said
I needed a secure location?

22:15.368 --> 22:17.468
This place
is totally secure.

22:17.470 --> 22:18.969
Although I don't know
who she is.

22:18.971 --> 22:21.906
I'm just being hilarious.
That's our Britney.

22:21.908 --> 22:23.574
You want a cup of tea?
There's a kebab.

22:23.576 --> 22:25.242
You can have anything
you want there.

22:25.244 --> 22:26.844
It's a kitchen, fully stocked.

22:26.846 --> 22:28.779
<i>♪ Kyle's mom's a bitch
She's a big fat bitch ♪</i>

22:28.781 --> 22:30.848
<i>♪ She's the biggest bitch
In the whole wide world ♪</i>

22:30.850 --> 22:32.583
<i>♪ She's a stupid bitch
If there ever was a bitch ♪</i>

22:32.585 --> 22:33.918
<i>♪ She's a bitch
To all the boys and girls ♪</i>

22:33.920 --> 22:35.840
<i>Shut your fucking mouth,
Cartman!</i>

22:37.523 --> 22:40.725
And this is our new babby,
Django Unchained.

22:40.727 --> 22:42.093
Hey, Dad.

22:42.095 --> 22:43.427
Who's that?

22:43.429 --> 22:45.196
That's me oldest son, Skeletor.

22:45.198 --> 22:46.464
Hiya. Hey!

22:46.466 --> 22:48.199
What's that, another son?

22:48.201 --> 22:49.800
Don't be daft.

22:49.802 --> 22:52.703
That's our grandson,
Gangnam Style.

22:53.773 --> 22:55.005
Hiya.

22:55.007 --> 22:56.207
Hi, Dad.

22:56.209 --> 22:57.942
And this here is Luke.

22:57.944 --> 23:00.411
We call him that
because he's got leukemia.

23:00.413 --> 23:02.613
I'm so sorry.

23:02.615 --> 23:04.415
He doesn't really.
We just shave his head

23:04.417 --> 23:05.983
so we can claim
the welfare for it.

23:05.985 --> 23:07.318
What?
You know what?

23:07.320 --> 23:09.086
You're looking at
a gold mine up there.

23:09.088 --> 23:12.690
This tragedy can turn
into 65 pound 40 a week.

23:13.793 --> 23:18.062
All right,
chemistry class is over.

23:18.064 --> 23:19.730
Time for biology.

23:19.732 --> 23:22.166
<i>At its maximum,
the mother's uterus</i>

23:22.168 --> 23:24.869
<i>expands to 25 cubic feet.</i>

23:24.871 --> 23:26.704
Who's this?
Who's that?

23:26.706 --> 23:28.739
The other bald man. Who's this?
Jason.

23:28.741 --> 23:30.141
He's Jason.
I'm Jason.

23:30.143 --> 23:32.343
I've got 11 kids.
Not easy to remember them all.

23:32.345 --> 23:34.378
Aah!
His name is not Sebastian,

23:34.380 --> 23:36.213
and that's all
you need to know.

23:36.215 --> 23:40.050
What the fuck are you on about,
Dad? It's Uncle Coddy.

23:40.052 --> 23:41.919
Give us a hug.

23:41.921 --> 23:43.454
I can't believe it's you.

23:43.456 --> 23:45.623
Welcome back to Grimsby.

23:45.625 --> 23:48.759
They're your family. Those are
your nephews and nieces.

23:48.761 --> 23:50.895
How do they know who I am?
I might've mentioned you

23:50.897 --> 23:52.663
couple of times
over the years.

23:52.665 --> 23:55.766
"Couple of times"?
I'll show him your wall, Dad.

23:58.538 --> 24:00.571
There's you as a kid.

24:11.284 --> 24:13.083
Leg it!
You little bastards.

24:13.085 --> 24:14.351
Give me back me ball!

24:14.353 --> 24:15.719
Fuck off.

24:15.721 --> 24:18.222
Nobby. Pass us the ball.
Come on.

24:18.224 --> 24:20.524
Pass it.
He's gonna score.

24:20.526 --> 24:22.766
England's gonna win the final.
Nobby, shoot!

24:24.130 --> 24:26.964
Oh...

24:26.966 --> 24:28.833
Morning, officer.

24:28.835 --> 24:30.801
Nobby and Sebastian Butcher.

24:30.803 --> 24:32.736
We were trying to return
that beautiful ball

24:32.738 --> 24:34.305
to its rightful owner.

24:34.307 --> 24:36.507
It's not about the ball, lads.

24:52.892 --> 24:56.260
Look, Seb. That's the couple
that's adopting us.

24:57.363 --> 24:58.896
They're from London.

24:58.898 --> 25:03.467
You're coming with me.
Right, Nobby?

25:03.469 --> 25:05.069
Of course.

25:05.071 --> 25:06.937
I'd never leave
my little brother.

25:08.774 --> 25:10.274
It's all right to be sad.

25:10.276 --> 25:13.310
But it's not all right
to stand there and whinge

25:13.312 --> 25:14.845
like a low mopey bastard.

25:14.847 --> 25:16.547
Who are we?
Come on, say it.

25:16.549 --> 25:18.883
We're Butcher Boys
of Grimsby.

25:18.885 --> 25:20.651
I didn't hear you.
Say it again.

25:20.653 --> 25:23.821
We're the fucking
Butcher Boys of Grimsby.

25:23.823 --> 25:25.489
They'll never split us up.

25:25.491 --> 25:27.825
Forever!
Forever!

25:29.729 --> 25:31.795
Anyway, your uncle don't want
to look at pictures

25:31.797 --> 25:33.197
of me and him all day,
do you?

25:33.199 --> 25:35.199
No.
What?

25:35.201 --> 25:36.667
No.

25:36.669 --> 25:38.202
All right. Come on.

25:38.204 --> 25:41.205
Let's take a look
at me travel photos of London.

25:41.207 --> 25:45.309
Come on, everyone.
Come on, squeeze up, squeeze up.

25:45.311 --> 25:48.379
This is the Norfolk Arms.
This is the Dog and Duck.

25:48.381 --> 25:49.880
This is the Three Crowns.

25:49.882 --> 25:51.715
And this is Charing Cross
police station.

25:51.717 --> 25:53.117
Fucking pigs.

25:53.119 --> 25:55.219
This is me with some free booze.

25:55.221 --> 25:58.022
And this is me with me finger
up an African boy's ass.

25:58.024 --> 25:59.990
Wait a minute. Go back.
Let me see.

26:06.165 --> 26:08.732
It's the assassin.

26:08.734 --> 26:11.702
Listen, London were fab.
But I missed you lot.

26:11.704 --> 26:14.672
Missed you too.
Missed you too, Dad.

26:17.276 --> 26:19.176
Answer it.

26:19.178 --> 26:20.377
Yes, sir.

26:20.379 --> 26:22.046
Hello?

26:22.048 --> 26:24.281
<i>Ledford's watching you,
isn't he?</i>

26:24.283 --> 26:25.482
<i>Say, "Hi, Daddy."</i>

26:25.484 --> 26:26.884
Hi, Daddy.

26:26.886 --> 26:27.885
Aww.

26:27.887 --> 26:29.320
<i>Check your e-mail.</i>

26:29.322 --> 26:31.488
<i>Find out who that is.</i>

26:31.490 --> 26:34.325
You'll have to access the global
facial recognition grid.

26:34.327 --> 26:36.060
And how am I going to do that?

26:36.062 --> 26:37.595
Figure it out.

26:39.098 --> 26:42.232
Hiya.
That the love of me life, Dawny?

26:42.234 --> 26:45.502
Is that my darling Nobby?
I'm back.

26:45.504 --> 26:48.372
I missed you so much.
Me too.

26:48.374 --> 26:49.607
All right, kids.
Out. Now.

26:49.609 --> 26:51.275
Out. Listen to your mum.
Out quick.

26:51.277 --> 26:54.445
I got something very important
that I need to tell your dad.

26:54.447 --> 26:55.646
What is it?

26:55.648 --> 26:57.681
I lost me panties.

26:57.683 --> 26:59.650
You sure your ass
hasn't eaten them again?

26:59.652 --> 27:03.153
No, you daft twat.
I didn't put any on.

27:06.058 --> 27:09.660
Ooh, I'm getting stiffer
than a pedophile at Legoland.

27:10.630 --> 27:12.863
Oh, look.
I'm exactly like

27:12.865 --> 27:16.300
Sharon Stallone
in <i> Basic Instincts.</i>

27:19.572 --> 27:21.038
Don't worry.

27:21.040 --> 27:22.506
That didn't come out
me bum.

27:22.508 --> 27:23.741
Oh.

27:23.743 --> 27:25.643
That one did.

27:25.645 --> 27:27.544
No problem.
Get over here.

27:27.546 --> 27:29.713
I know you must
be gagging for it.

27:29.715 --> 27:32.182
All right.
Come here, Nobby.

27:33.386 --> 27:35.085
Hey.
What?

27:35.087 --> 27:37.621
I'm hungry
for a Grimsby breakfast.

27:37.623 --> 27:38.956
Well, the buffet's open.

27:38.958 --> 27:40.724
I'll need a table for one.

27:40.726 --> 27:42.493
It's all-you-can-eat.

27:42.495 --> 27:44.128
See you in about
60 minutes.

27:44.130 --> 27:45.429
Get going.

27:45.431 --> 27:47.131
Ahem, Nobby.
Oh.

27:47.133 --> 27:52.436
That's me darts partner,
um... Ben Kingsley.

27:53.539 --> 27:55.439
Nobby, what do you
take me for?

27:55.441 --> 27:58.042
I know who that is.
That's your brother.

27:58.044 --> 28:00.110
Where the fuck you been
all these years?

28:00.112 --> 28:03.914
I've been busy. Congratulations,
by the way. When are you due?

28:03.916 --> 28:07.618
Oh, I'm not pregnant.
I'm just fucking fat.

28:07.620 --> 28:09.086
- Nobby.
- What?

28:09.088 --> 28:10.954
It's imperative
no one know that I'm here.

28:10.956 --> 28:13.624
You need somewhere isolated
where there's no one around?

28:13.626 --> 28:14.992
Exactly.
All right.

28:14.994 --> 28:17.061
I know just the place.

28:17.063 --> 28:20.097
It's just this way,
past the train station.

28:27.173 --> 28:30.407
<i>All aboard the 915,
Grimsby to London.</i>

28:30.409 --> 28:31.842
In you go.

28:36.315 --> 28:38.449
Do you think our new parents
will let us sleep

28:38.451 --> 28:39.983
in the same room?

28:39.985 --> 28:42.953
If we have bunk beds,
can I have the top?

28:42.955 --> 28:44.555
You can have the top,
little man.

28:46.092 --> 28:48.792
Go and have a pee now
before the other passengers do.

28:48.794 --> 28:50.194
Okay, bruv.

28:51.230 --> 28:54.364
And Sebastian...
What is it?

28:56.435 --> 28:58.068
Nothing.

29:10.649 --> 29:12.249
Nobby?

29:16.088 --> 29:17.287
Nobby?

29:18.357 --> 29:20.424
Nobby? Nobby?

29:23.963 --> 29:28.432
Nobby? Nobby?
Have you seen me brother, Nobby?

29:28.434 --> 29:31.502
Nobby, where are you? Nobby!

29:31.504 --> 29:34.571
No! Nobby!

29:34.573 --> 29:36.306
Come back!

29:36.308 --> 29:38.976
Come back, Nobby!

29:40.212 --> 29:42.546
Sebbo. Come on.

29:44.216 --> 29:47.217
I know. It's great to be back,
isn't it?

29:48.821 --> 29:51.288
Here we go.
Just in here.

29:51.290 --> 29:52.856
You sure this location
is secure?

29:52.858 --> 29:55.425
Relax.
Trust your brother.

29:58.597 --> 30:00.831
Surprise!

30:01.801 --> 30:04.368
No, no! Seb!
Come on, no.

30:04.370 --> 30:05.803
No, they're our folk.

30:05.805 --> 30:07.971
Welcome home.

30:07.973 --> 30:09.606
Nobody's supposed
to know I'm here.

30:09.608 --> 30:11.008
No one does know you're here.

30:11.010 --> 30:12.242
These people know
I'm here.

30:12.244 --> 30:14.845
- Do you know he's here?
- No!

30:18.384 --> 30:19.917
We are here.

30:19.919 --> 30:21.185
<i>Good work, Chilcott.</i>

30:21.187 --> 30:22.553
<i>How did you find him?</i>

30:22.555 --> 30:25.055
Let's just call it
professional intuition.

30:28.994 --> 30:30.527
What's that smell?

30:30.529 --> 30:32.963
That's me. Milky Pimms.

30:32.965 --> 30:34.731
Oh.
I work our docks.

30:34.733 --> 30:37.935
We transport cod
all over the world.

30:37.937 --> 30:39.603
Fascinating.

30:41.006 --> 30:42.506
Can I help you?

30:44.710 --> 30:46.877
Chilcott. Move.

30:46.879 --> 30:49.479
What is it?

30:49.481 --> 30:52.082
Oh, God, I'm cornered.

30:52.084 --> 30:53.517
I should never
have come here alone.

30:53.519 --> 30:56.720
You're never alone
in Grimsby, bruv.

30:56.722 --> 30:59.056
Lads. Lads.

31:00.025 --> 31:01.558
See those blokes out there?

31:01.560 --> 31:04.795
Those are Manchester United
supporters.

31:04.797 --> 31:06.330
How dare those twats
show up here?

31:06.332 --> 31:09.766
Delay them. I promise
I'll burn your school down.

31:09.768 --> 31:10.968
No school!
Come on.

31:10.970 --> 31:12.502
Oi, lads.
Get the ball!

31:12.504 --> 31:15.105
- Let's go, lads.
- They've got guns!

31:20.379 --> 31:23.413
Excuse me, sir.
I think you dropped something.

31:23.415 --> 31:24.915
Dropped what?

31:27.853 --> 31:29.353
You're in Grimsby now,
you git!

31:29.355 --> 31:31.822
Do you think I'll hesitate
to kill you? Little bastard.

31:31.824 --> 31:34.091
Now!

31:38.964 --> 31:40.497
Sanjiv, now!

31:48.040 --> 31:50.207
Fish factory, this way.

31:50.209 --> 31:52.609
Come on, fish factory.
Go there.

31:52.611 --> 31:54.678
Quick. In there. Let's go.

32:02.521 --> 32:03.987
Aah!

32:10.296 --> 32:11.528
Seb.

32:11.530 --> 32:14.131
What have you done?
You've killed him.

32:20.973 --> 32:22.372
Nobby, what are you doing?

32:22.374 --> 32:24.942
I'm showing some respect
for the dead.

32:24.944 --> 32:27.044
There you go, mate.

32:35.487 --> 32:36.787
Nobby!
What?

32:36.789 --> 32:39.523
Get over here.
What is it?

32:39.525 --> 32:41.725
I need you to suck
this wound in my shoulder.

32:41.727 --> 32:44.828
No, no, no, I don't put my lips
on another man's shoulder.

32:44.830 --> 32:46.129
That's very gay.
Do it now.

32:46.131 --> 32:47.497
People have been
chucked out of Grimsby

32:47.499 --> 32:49.399
for ordering
a vegetarian breakfast.

32:49.401 --> 32:51.835
That pellet was filled with
<i>Lonomia</i> caterpillar toxin.

32:51.837 --> 32:54.404
I'll be dead in 90 seconds
if you don't suck it out.

32:54.406 --> 32:56.173
Okay, okay.

32:57.309 --> 32:59.409
Suck hard.

32:59.411 --> 33:00.644
That's it.

33:00.646 --> 33:01.912
Don't swallow the poison.

33:01.914 --> 33:03.313
And now spit it out.

33:04.984 --> 33:07.117
Well done.
Praise the Lord.

33:07.119 --> 33:09.052
I thought I'd lost you,
brother.

33:09.054 --> 33:10.454
I love you so much.
Nobby.

33:10.456 --> 33:12.556
What?
I've been hit somewhere else.

33:12.558 --> 33:13.757
Where?

33:16.562 --> 33:18.695
I'm not falling for that one.
No way.

33:18.697 --> 33:21.098
No, you don't...
What are you doing?

33:21.100 --> 33:23.600
No, why are you
taking those off?

33:23.602 --> 33:26.169
The toxin's coursing through
the left lobule of my teste.

33:26.171 --> 33:29.740
Up the spermatic plexus
to my kidneys. Suck it.

33:29.742 --> 33:31.074
Whoo!

33:31.076 --> 33:32.576
As Jesus said,

33:32.578 --> 33:36.546
"Thou shalt not suck off
your own fucking brother."

33:36.548 --> 33:39.349
Do it, or I'll be dead
in 60 seconds.

33:39.351 --> 33:41.418
I've been searching for you
for almost 30 year.

33:41.420 --> 33:44.554
I could've found you
in two minutes on Grindr.

33:44.556 --> 33:48.158
Choose. You can suck my scrotum
or you can let me die.

33:49.328 --> 33:50.594
Okay.

33:50.596 --> 33:52.829
What would you like written
on your gravestone?

33:52.831 --> 33:54.564
Suck my balls!

33:54.566 --> 33:56.400
Whoa!

33:56.402 --> 33:57.901
I have less than 40 seconds.

33:57.903 --> 33:59.569
All right.

33:59.571 --> 34:01.471
This is for Dad.

34:03.709 --> 34:05.909
Suck it. Suck harder.

34:05.911 --> 34:07.944
Suck and spit.

34:07.946 --> 34:12.382
Suck and spit.
Suck and spit.

34:12.384 --> 34:14.918
It's traveling too fast.
I need to be on top.

34:14.920 --> 34:17.420
Over here.

34:17.422 --> 34:20.023
What? No. I draw the line
at teabagging.

34:22.995 --> 34:24.460
Must shake this out.

34:25.563 --> 34:27.697
It's not working.

34:34.806 --> 34:36.005
Coddy.

34:36.007 --> 34:39.876
Coddy, don't go. Coddy.

34:39.878 --> 34:42.813
I've lost you once.

34:42.815 --> 34:45.248
I refuse to lose you again.

34:54.860 --> 34:56.760
Oh!

34:58.230 --> 34:59.429
That's it.

34:59.431 --> 35:01.565
We did it.
You did it.

35:01.567 --> 35:02.799
We did...

35:02.801 --> 35:05.068
You just came on me face.

35:05.070 --> 35:07.037
It was a trickle
of pre-ejaculate at most.

35:07.039 --> 35:08.472
Grow up.

35:20.419 --> 35:23.687
<i>I envision a day when people
won't have to live like this.</i>

35:23.689 --> 35:26.490
<i>A day when poverty
will be eradicated.</i>

35:26.492 --> 35:28.492
<i>And I know it's possible.</i>

35:28.494 --> 35:30.560
Sir, we've got something.

35:30.562 --> 35:33.363
<i>Suck harder.
Suck and spit.</i>

35:33.365 --> 35:35.599
So, what's this
new intelligence, Marber?

35:35.601 --> 35:38.502
We've identified the partner,
sir. He's Graves' brother.

35:38.504 --> 35:40.036
Brother?
Kyle Alan Butcher,

35:40.038 --> 35:41.638
a.k.a. Nobby Butcher.

35:41.640 --> 35:43.173
A Maelstrom sleeper,
no doubt.

35:43.175 --> 35:45.909
Just some working-class scum.

35:45.911 --> 35:47.511
Find them and kill them.

35:47.513 --> 35:48.712
Yes, sir.

35:52.684 --> 35:54.451
<i>I found the assassin.</i>

35:54.453 --> 35:56.887
<i>He's Pavel Lukashenko.
He's on route to South Africa.</i>

35:56.889 --> 35:58.221
Good.

35:58.223 --> 36:00.157
Yeah. And they know
about your brother.

36:00.159 --> 36:01.791
No problem.
I'm about to ditch him.

36:01.793 --> 36:03.593
Listen.

36:03.595 --> 36:06.863
They'll kill him and his family
too if they catch him.

36:06.865 --> 36:09.499
<i>Do you really want
your brother to die?</i>

36:22.548 --> 36:23.747
Forget it.

36:23.749 --> 36:25.815
Look, I need to talk
to your friend.

36:25.817 --> 36:28.285
Uh, what...? Milky?

36:28.287 --> 36:30.720
The fish travel agent?

36:31.723 --> 36:33.924
What, so you can
gob-rape him too?

36:33.926 --> 36:35.158
You monster.

36:35.160 --> 36:37.127
No.

36:37.129 --> 36:38.929
We're going
to South Africa.

36:40.666 --> 36:41.898
Really?

36:41.900 --> 36:45.268
I'm going on holiday
with me babby brother.

37:15.701 --> 37:18.768
<i>It's a semifinal that
has become gripped by tension.</i>

37:18.770 --> 37:22.072
<i>And England to have the ball.
Time for one last attack, baby.</i>

37:22.074 --> 37:24.474
Come on, Sterling.
<i>The ball's broken for Sterling.</i>

37:24.476 --> 37:26.610
Get in there.
<i>Raheem Sterling's through.</i>

37:26.612 --> 37:28.545
<i>And Raheem Sterling
scores for England!</i>

37:28.547 --> 37:30.513
<i>That surely puts England</i>

37:30.515 --> 37:32.816
<i>into the final in Chile.</i>

37:32.818 --> 37:34.384
<i>Here we go!</i>

37:34.386 --> 37:36.319
We spit on your face!

37:36.321 --> 37:37.821
Here we go! Here we go!

37:37.823 --> 37:41.524
Nobby. They're beating up
Zeke Stanton.

37:41.526 --> 37:42.859
Nazi bastard!

37:42.861 --> 37:44.995
Pitch invasion!
Pitch invasion!

37:44.997 --> 37:47.597
- Nazi scum!
- Let's get them!

37:47.599 --> 37:49.499
- Come on.
- Yeah!

38:06.785 --> 38:11.254
<i>That's it. England are going
to the final in Chile.</i>

38:15.260 --> 38:16.893
Jodie.
Hi, Daddy.

38:16.895 --> 38:18.928
No, no, stop doing that now.
It's weird.

38:18.930 --> 38:20.930
I've discovered
where Lukashenko is.

38:20.932 --> 38:25.735
I tracked him to the Tshukaru
Bush Lodge in Kruger Park.

38:25.737 --> 38:29.606
<i>He's meeting up with
a biochemist called Joris Smit.</i>

38:29.608 --> 38:32.709
<i>Maelstrom are clearly
buying something from him.</i>

38:32.711 --> 38:35.578
<i>He's currently in a hotel room
with Lina Smit, his wife,</i>

38:35.580 --> 38:37.914
<i>famed for her promiscuity.</i>

38:37.916 --> 38:40.884
You need to find out from her.
You may need to seduce her.

38:40.886 --> 38:43.119
Well, as you know,
I'll do anything for England.

38:43.121 --> 38:44.621
<i>Book me a room at the lodge.</i>

38:44.623 --> 38:47.357
I have done.
Your alias is Mr. Shelton.

38:47.359 --> 38:48.992
Hey, English.
What?

38:48.994 --> 38:50.760
I have something for you
to celebrate:

38:50.762 --> 38:54.230
the best heroin in Africa.
Enjoy.

38:54.232 --> 38:57.067
I'm embarrassed to say I've
never actually tried any before.

38:57.069 --> 38:58.668
You'll like it.
Listen,

38:58.670 --> 39:00.170
I'd love to stay in touch.

39:00.172 --> 39:01.905
Are you on e-mail or...?
Linkedln.

39:01.907 --> 39:06.276
It is
TabansiNyaguraHeroinDealer15.

39:06.278 --> 39:08.311
Yes.

39:08.313 --> 39:09.746
Who's that you were
talking to?

39:09.748 --> 39:11.881
That is me new mate,
Tabansi.

39:11.883 --> 39:14.217
He flies to and from
South America

39:14.219 --> 39:16.686
with drugs rammed up
his bottom.

39:16.688 --> 39:19.923
It's either that
or a life of crime.

39:21.460 --> 39:22.759
Nobby.

39:22.761 --> 39:24.327
I'll be gone
for a couple of hours.

39:24.329 --> 39:26.196
Why? What are you up to?

39:26.198 --> 39:29.299
I'm meeting someone to find out
why Lukashenko came here.

39:29.301 --> 39:32.669
You stay here,
understood?

39:42.414 --> 39:43.980
Oh, no.

39:46.518 --> 39:49.119
I think I might've
mixed up our needles.

39:49.121 --> 39:51.488
Oh, my God.

39:51.490 --> 39:54.591
You can't do a secret mission
on heroin.

39:54.593 --> 39:56.559
Not to worry,
all right?

39:56.561 --> 39:58.862
Just leave the spying
to your brother.

40:10.308 --> 40:11.508
Sebastian?

40:11.510 --> 40:13.643
No, he's currently on couch,

40:13.645 --> 40:15.044
smacked off his tits.

40:15.046 --> 40:16.446
Who is this?

40:16.448 --> 40:18.014
<i>I'm his brother, Nobby.</i>

40:18.016 --> 40:19.015
Can I help?

40:19.017 --> 40:22.552
Nobby, I need you
to listen to me.

40:22.554 --> 40:24.654
<i>You are going to have
to take his place.</i>

40:24.656 --> 40:27.657
You need to head
to Maitland Station.

40:27.659 --> 40:29.959
There, you'll meet a driver
from Tshukaru Bush Lodge.

40:29.961 --> 40:33.563
When you meet him,
your alias is Mr. Shelton.

40:33.565 --> 40:35.098
Did you get that?

40:35.100 --> 40:37.901
<i>I'll send the information
to your lens.</i>

40:47.245 --> 40:52.215
<i>♪ Is it my imagination ♪</i>

40:52.217 --> 40:56.619
<i>♪ Or have I finally found
Something worth living for? ♪</i>

41:01.193 --> 41:05.261
<i>♪ You could wait

41:05.263 --> 41:08.998
<i>♪ To spend your days
In the sunshine ♪</i>

41:09.000 --> 41:12.669

41:20.212 --> 41:23.880
<i>♪ You've gotta

41:25.951 --> 41:27.350
Oh, no. Open the door!

41:27.352 --> 41:29.085
Open the door!

41:41.500 --> 41:45.401
Okay, you need to head inside,
find Lina Smit and seduce her.

41:45.403 --> 41:47.303
What, and cheat on Dawny?
Never.

41:47.305 --> 41:49.305
You need to seduce her
in order to find out

41:49.307 --> 41:51.875
<i>what Lukashenko
bought from her husband.</i>

41:51.877 --> 41:53.276
Okay.

41:57.215 --> 41:59.449
<i>Can you see Lina Smit?</i>

41:59.451 --> 42:01.417
She's easy to spot.

42:01.419 --> 42:04.988
<i>She's wearing a green dress,
and she's absolutely gorgeous.</i>

42:11.596 --> 42:13.630
Oh, no.

42:13.632 --> 42:15.031
She is gorgeous.

42:15.033 --> 42:16.232
<i>Got her?</i>

42:16.234 --> 42:17.867
Bingo.

42:25.243 --> 42:28.945
<i>I've got to go.
Remember, act sophisticated.</i>

42:30.682 --> 42:33.716
Hello, pussycat.

42:33.718 --> 42:35.251
The name is...

42:35.253 --> 42:37.186
Shelton.

42:37.188 --> 42:38.721
M.R. Shelton.

42:38.723 --> 42:41.024
I've been looking for you.

42:41.026 --> 42:42.692
You want room clean?

42:42.694 --> 42:44.861
Room clean?

42:44.863 --> 42:47.730
Yeah. Yes. "Room clean."

42:47.732 --> 42:50.300
From top to bottom.

42:50.302 --> 42:51.568
I'm in 23.

42:51.570 --> 42:54.704
But together,
we could make it 69.

42:54.706 --> 42:56.673
Okay. I come soon.

43:13.024 --> 43:14.457
Come on.

43:14.459 --> 43:15.858
Ugh!

43:17.596 --> 43:19.228
Good afternoon.

43:19.230 --> 43:22.432
Hello. There's an emergency.
It's a code brown.

43:22.434 --> 43:23.733
<i>A code brown, sir?</i>

43:23.735 --> 43:26.035
I've blocked the toiletry.

43:26.037 --> 43:28.705
Could you send somebody up
as soon as you can, please?

43:28.707 --> 43:30.406
Okay, Mr. Shelton.

43:30.408 --> 43:31.874
I will send you
assistance.

43:31.876 --> 43:34.010
Sebastian Graves is here.

43:34.012 --> 43:36.746
<i>Go to his room and seduce him.</i>

43:36.748 --> 43:38.281
<i>I'll be there soon.</i>

43:38.283 --> 43:40.717
Oh, good. Maintenance is here.

43:43.622 --> 43:45.054
Mr. Shelton.

43:45.056 --> 43:46.456
That is really
fast service.

43:46.458 --> 43:48.658
I only just called down.

43:48.660 --> 43:50.627
Thank you for coming
so quickly.

43:50.629 --> 43:54.097
I hope I can reciprocate.

43:55.333 --> 43:56.766
Yeah.

43:56.768 --> 43:58.134
Anyway, uh, follow me.

43:58.136 --> 44:01.804
Uh, ahem, come on.
In here. Let's do this.

44:03.375 --> 44:05.541
Not your usual place to do it.

44:05.543 --> 44:08.544
What? Why?

44:08.546 --> 44:09.812
Where did you expect me
to do it?

44:09.814 --> 44:11.214
In the bed.

44:11.216 --> 44:13.383
In the... In the bed?
I'm not an animal.

44:13.385 --> 44:16.185
I haven't done one in a bed
for over five weeks.

44:16.187 --> 44:18.755
Let's be quick with this.
Shall I show it to you?

44:18.757 --> 44:20.923
How do I know
that when I see it,

44:20.925 --> 44:23.960
I won't fall
madly in love with you?

44:25.063 --> 44:28.364
There's really
not much danger of that.

44:29.601 --> 44:30.800
It's enormous.

44:30.802 --> 44:33.770
All the better.

44:33.772 --> 44:35.672
How hard is it?

44:35.674 --> 44:37.607
Well, okay.

44:37.609 --> 44:39.942
Let me try and remember.
Um...

44:39.944 --> 44:42.145
I mean, the top of it is,
you know, very hard.

44:42.147 --> 44:43.546
Actually,
painfully so.

44:43.548 --> 44:44.881
Mmm.

44:44.883 --> 44:47.316
Then kind of medium soft.

44:47.318 --> 44:51.220
And at the base of it,
really hard again.

44:51.222 --> 44:53.990
Now, should I tell you
what I'm gonna do with it?

44:53.992 --> 44:55.525
No.

44:55.527 --> 44:57.927
I'm gonna take it
in my hand.

44:57.929 --> 44:59.929
All of it.
Right.

44:59.931 --> 45:01.330
That's very unusual.

45:01.332 --> 45:02.532
Yeah.
Right?

45:02.534 --> 45:03.900
And then I'm gonna kiss it.

45:03.902 --> 45:05.835
Gonna kiss it?

45:05.837 --> 45:09.806
And I'm gonna put
all of it in my mouth.

45:12.310 --> 45:15.545
This is worse
than <i> 2 Girls and 1 Cup.</i>

45:15.547 --> 45:19.015
I bet it tastes like
strawberries.

45:19.017 --> 45:22.985
And I bet you that it tastes
of kebab with extra curry sauce.

45:25.290 --> 45:28.157
Listen. You're a total
fucking weirdo, right?

45:28.159 --> 45:32.028
Just stay in here
and do not come out.

45:32.030 --> 45:33.229
Okay.

45:40.305 --> 45:43.573
So we meet again.

45:43.575 --> 45:45.808
Please, come in.

45:47.045 --> 45:48.945
Okay.

45:52.450 --> 45:55.752
What are you doing?
Let someone else do that.

45:58.256 --> 46:01.190
Please excuse me
for one moment.

46:03.128 --> 46:05.695
What the hell are you doing?

46:05.697 --> 46:07.296
I'm getting myself ready.

46:07.298 --> 46:09.365
Shh! Listen, I get it.

46:09.367 --> 46:11.834
You don't wanna get any
brown shrapnel on your clothes.

46:11.836 --> 46:14.470
Brown... Brown shrapnel?

46:14.472 --> 46:16.372
This.

46:17.942 --> 46:21.177
You see? Hard, soft, hard.

46:22.580 --> 46:24.213
May the best man win.

46:26.484 --> 46:29.085
- I go in there now.
- No, no, no.

46:29.087 --> 46:32.088
Let's get acquainted.

46:34.893 --> 46:36.959
Has anyone ever told you

46:36.961 --> 46:39.395
that you're a very
beautiful woman?

46:41.933 --> 46:43.900
You are the most
beautiful thing

46:43.902 --> 46:46.769
to ever walk the Lord's
green earth.

46:49.541 --> 46:52.475
We're getting signal
from Graves' lens, sir.

46:52.477 --> 46:53.676
Put it up.

46:53.678 --> 46:56.412
So, what are we looking at?

47:00.351 --> 47:02.385
Good God, Graves.

47:04.556 --> 47:06.088
Whoo!

47:06.090 --> 47:08.457
Why did Lukashenko
meet your husband?

47:08.459 --> 47:12.328
Can you zoom in
on that stationery?

47:14.699 --> 47:17.099
Send the coordinates
to Chilcott.

47:19.304 --> 47:22.171
You'd rather make love
to a maid than me?

47:22.173 --> 47:23.406
Maid?

47:25.643 --> 47:27.610
Banu, out!

47:27.612 --> 47:29.245
Sorry, Mrs. Smit.

47:29.247 --> 47:31.347
Mrs. Smit?

47:31.349 --> 47:32.548
Get out, Banu!

47:32.550 --> 47:34.383
I'm so sorry. Sorry.

47:36.221 --> 47:42.058
Now, let me show you
how wild this animal can be.

47:45.230 --> 47:49.966
Did you really think I'd let you
sleep with my wife, Mr. Graves?

47:49.968 --> 47:51.467
No. But then again,
I never thought

47:51.469 --> 47:53.936
that she'd chop up me poo
with a coat hanger.

47:56.274 --> 48:00.943
Goodbye, Sebastian Graves.

48:00.945 --> 48:03.112
That's not Sebastian Graves.

48:08.086 --> 48:09.785
You okay?
Yeah.

48:09.787 --> 48:11.020
How was the heroin?

48:11.022 --> 48:13.389
Better than expected.

48:14.859 --> 48:16.592
Why did Lukashenko
meet your husband?

48:16.594 --> 48:17.927
What are Maelstrom planning?

48:17.929 --> 48:19.829
I don't know.

48:19.831 --> 48:21.364
Seb, don't.

48:22.634 --> 48:25.101
Don't take it personal, love.
He kills everyone.

48:25.103 --> 48:27.970
It's because he used
to wet the bed.

48:27.972 --> 48:30.406
It's important she knows.
It's not important.

48:30.408 --> 48:32.975
Well, it was important
to the boy on the bunk under you

48:32.977 --> 48:34.577
who used to get
dripped on at night.

48:34.579 --> 48:35.778
Get on with it.

48:35.780 --> 48:37.880
Just tell us what you know,

48:37.882 --> 48:39.482
and he'll let you live.

48:39.484 --> 48:40.683
Come on.

48:41.986 --> 48:44.453
Lukashenko bought
some kind of virus.

48:44.455 --> 48:46.355
When is he gonna use it?

48:46.357 --> 48:48.224
Tomorrow.

48:48.226 --> 48:50.526
Where are they gonna
release the virus?

48:56.267 --> 48:58.067
They'll...

48:59.304 --> 49:01.103
Get down!

49:02.774 --> 49:04.173
Stay down!

49:08.880 --> 49:11.147
It's Chilcott. Move!

49:14.385 --> 49:15.584
Come on!

49:29.634 --> 49:31.534
Come on. Run.

49:45.783 --> 49:47.783
There's nowhere to hide.

49:47.785 --> 49:49.385
I got an idea.
Oh, great.

49:49.387 --> 49:50.820
Because your ideas
have netted nothing

49:50.822 --> 49:52.054
but gold up to this point.

49:52.056 --> 49:53.356
You're gonna follow me

49:53.358 --> 49:55.257
and do exactly
what your big brother says.

49:55.259 --> 49:56.959
Hurry!
Come on.

50:08.039 --> 50:09.905
Where'd they go?

50:09.907 --> 50:12.141
They were just here.
Spread out.

50:12.143 --> 50:14.243
Find them.

50:17.882 --> 50:20.149
Oh, God, this is disgusting.

50:36.234 --> 50:38.100
Sir, take a look at this!

50:40.671 --> 50:43.939
- Check if they've gone.
- I'm trying to.

50:46.177 --> 50:49.078
What can you see?
They've gone?

50:49.080 --> 50:50.713
The coast is clear.

50:50.715 --> 50:52.581
Good. Let's get out of here.

50:54.752 --> 50:56.419
Oh, no.

50:57.889 --> 50:59.722
Oh, fuck me!

50:59.724 --> 51:01.023
Brace yourself, Seb!

51:03.728 --> 51:05.061
Get off him!

51:05.063 --> 51:07.396
Get it off me. Aah!

51:07.398 --> 51:10.599
The male can fuck
for up to three hours.

51:10.601 --> 51:12.234
We have to make it come.

51:12.236 --> 51:13.836
I saw it on the BBC.

51:13.838 --> 51:17.339
You work the shaft,
and I'll cradle the balls.

51:17.341 --> 51:19.821
It's gonna
break my neck.

51:21.345 --> 51:23.279
I got them.

51:23.281 --> 51:25.114
Come on, Sebbo.
You can do it.

51:25.116 --> 51:26.782
I'm doing it!
I'm doing it!

51:26.784 --> 51:30.653
Put your tongue in the peehole.
Don't be stupid.

51:30.655 --> 51:34.123
I think we're in business.
I think we're in business.

51:35.660 --> 51:38.094
Come on. Come on.

51:42.467 --> 51:43.899
Oh, God.

51:43.901 --> 51:45.701
That is revolting!

51:46.704 --> 51:48.671
<i>Hakuna matata.</i>

51:48.673 --> 51:49.872
Well done.

51:52.276 --> 51:53.676
I think I'm gonna be sick.

51:53.678 --> 51:55.778
It's a trickle
of pre-ejaculate at most.

51:55.780 --> 51:56.979
Grow up.

51:56.981 --> 51:58.714
See if the coast is clear.

52:00.418 --> 52:03.018
Oh, no.
What? What is it?

52:03.020 --> 52:05.421
It's an elephant
bukkake party.

52:05.423 --> 52:06.989
Get it out.

52:06.991 --> 52:08.491
It's breaking me asshole.

52:09.327 --> 52:11.460
Not much longer now.

52:11.462 --> 52:14.830
Brace yourself! Aah!
No!

52:21.405 --> 52:23.772
All right.

52:28.012 --> 52:29.678
Are you okay?

52:33.384 --> 52:35.718
No, I'm not okay.

52:35.720 --> 52:38.420
I just did
an entirely white poo.

52:38.422 --> 52:40.582
You need to get cleaned up.
Get in.

52:41.959 --> 52:43.592
Is me ass okay?

52:43.594 --> 52:45.194
Huh?

52:45.196 --> 52:48.264
Yeah, it's good.
It's really good.

52:53.404 --> 52:55.604
Are those your bollocks?

52:55.606 --> 52:57.873
Someone's given you a hickey
on your right nut.

52:59.243 --> 53:00.643
That was you.

53:02.079 --> 53:03.759
Oh.

53:04.949 --> 53:06.382
It's Jodie.

53:07.318 --> 53:08.684
She could be your missus.

53:08.686 --> 53:10.686
No, I could never be
with one woman.

53:10.688 --> 53:13.622
Well, you're missing out
on the greatest gift in life:

53:13.624 --> 53:15.424
Family.

53:15.426 --> 53:18.661
The only gift I ever got
from my family was betrayal.

53:20.398 --> 53:21.964
Why did you do it?

53:22.967 --> 53:24.200
It doesn't matter.

53:24.202 --> 53:25.401
It doesn't matter?

53:25.403 --> 53:27.570
You abandoned me
when I was 6.

53:27.572 --> 53:29.171
Now, why?

53:37.248 --> 53:39.181
We have made our decision.

53:39.183 --> 53:42.651
We've decided we can take one
of the brothers, Mr. Lowsley.

53:42.653 --> 53:46.922
But Mr. and Mrs. Graves,
these boys are inseparable.

53:46.924 --> 53:50.559
It would break their hearts,
and affect them both very badly.

53:50.561 --> 53:52.561
This is the decision
we have come to.

53:52.563 --> 53:54.697
But that would
leave one of the brothers

53:54.699 --> 53:56.332
in the foster system
in Grimsby.

53:56.334 --> 53:58.033
It's no place for a boy.

53:58.035 --> 54:00.436
He'll have no future here.

54:09.213 --> 54:11.347
All aboard!

54:13.251 --> 54:15.351
SEBASTIAN
Nobby!

54:15.353 --> 54:17.653
Have you seen
me brother Nobby?

54:17.655 --> 54:20.022
Nobby!

54:20.024 --> 54:22.825
No! Nobby!

54:22.827 --> 54:24.326
Come back, Nobby!

54:28.766 --> 54:30.766
Oh, my God.

54:30.768 --> 54:32.401
So I could have had
your life?

54:32.403 --> 54:33.602
That's right.

54:33.604 --> 54:36.672
And you could have had mine.

54:37.908 --> 54:39.441
Nobby...

54:40.978 --> 54:42.378
I...

54:46.450 --> 54:49.018
I am so sorry.

54:49.020 --> 54:50.452
Wait.

54:50.454 --> 54:54.189
I think our penises
just fist-bumped.

54:54.191 --> 54:56.492
Disengage.

54:56.494 --> 54:58.661
You need to focus, right?
Yeah.

54:58.663 --> 55:00.296
You need to find out
where Maelstrom

55:00.298 --> 55:01.764
are planning to blow up
tomorrow.

55:01.766 --> 55:04.900
And I need to find a pub
to watch the final in.

55:08.039 --> 55:11.473
Hold on. That's it.
They're gonna blow up the sun.

55:11.475 --> 55:14.743
No, they're planning to bomb
the final in Chile.

55:14.745 --> 55:16.612
What?
How are we supposed to get

55:16.614 --> 55:18.113
halfway around the world
in 12 hours

55:18.115 --> 55:20.549
with the entire global
intelligence community

55:20.551 --> 55:23.419
trying to kill me?
We'll never make it.

55:23.421 --> 55:25.621
I searched for you
for 28 years.

55:25.623 --> 55:29.325
I do not believe in never.

55:36.200 --> 55:38.534
That's the beauty of Linkedln.

55:39.470 --> 55:40.836
Hey, Nobb-Man.

55:40.838 --> 55:42.638
How is your brother
going to blend in

55:42.640 --> 55:43.906
with those football
hooligans

55:43.908 --> 55:46.208
looking like the guy
from <i> Despicable Me?</i>

55:55.152 --> 55:56.952
England!

55:58.022 --> 55:59.288
England!

55:59.290 --> 56:00.723
<i>English and German fans</i>

56:00.725 --> 56:02.558
<i>have been arriving here
in Santiago</i>

56:02.560 --> 56:03.959
<i>throughout the last
few days.</i>

56:03.961 --> 56:05.761
<i>Looks like the perfect place</i>

56:05.763 --> 56:07.563
<i>to come and watch
your national team play</i>

56:07.565 --> 56:09.398
<i>for what is ultimately
the greatest prize</i>

56:09.400 --> 56:10.733
<i>in world football.</i>

56:10.735 --> 56:12.601
<i>This is a truly
international occasion.</i>

56:12.603 --> 56:14.069
<i>We've seen Donald Trump.</i>

56:14.071 --> 56:18.207
Star of stage and screen,
Daniel Radcliffe is here.

56:18.209 --> 56:20.809
<i>Middle East peace symbol
Schlomo Khalidi,</i>

56:20.811 --> 56:23.779
<i>looking much better,
is here too.</i>

56:23.781 --> 56:25.881
<i>So much color and noise.</i>

56:25.883 --> 56:28.183
<i>And there will be plenty of
both at the end of the match,</i>

56:28.185 --> 56:30.119
<i>because the final whistle
will trigger</i>

56:30.121 --> 56:33.489
<i>what we are told will be
the biggest firework display</i>

56:33.491 --> 56:36.658
<i>ever seen at a sporting event.</i>

56:36.660 --> 56:38.460
When we was kids,

56:38.462 --> 56:42.498
did you ever think that we'd end
up going to the final together?

56:42.500 --> 56:44.133
Yes, I did, brother.

56:46.237 --> 56:48.170
Nobby!

56:51.742 --> 56:54.309
No.
Surprise!

56:54.311 --> 56:56.412
Oh!

56:56.414 --> 56:58.447
I missed you so much.

56:58.449 --> 57:01.150
Hey. Our favorite spy!

57:01.152 --> 57:03.452
<i>He's MI6's finest!</i>

57:03.454 --> 57:06.121
<i>He's MI6's finest!</i>

57:06.123 --> 57:07.790
Keep quiet.

57:07.792 --> 57:09.992
Nothing to see!

57:14.098 --> 57:15.864
There's a commotion, sir.

57:15.866 --> 57:17.065
Get in closer.

57:19.270 --> 57:20.769
Graves.

57:24.008 --> 57:26.175
Nobby.
Hey. I'll be back. Coddy!

57:26.177 --> 57:27.576
Wait. Nobby!

57:48.199 --> 57:50.265
Let's go.

57:50.267 --> 57:52.501
Sebbo? Sebbo?

57:53.838 --> 57:55.237
Sebbo!

57:55.239 --> 57:56.872
Oi!

57:56.874 --> 57:58.073
Seb!

58:10.988 --> 58:12.721
Got you.

58:29.139 --> 58:31.006
What is this place?

58:37.014 --> 58:39.081
Oh, my God.

58:39.083 --> 58:41.650
Maelstrom are sex
traffickers.

58:42.820 --> 58:44.186
Listen to me.
You've gotta get out

58:44.188 --> 58:46.288
before they sell you
to the highest bidder.

58:46.290 --> 58:48.991
Get out. Get out now. Out.

58:48.993 --> 58:51.426
Out. Shh! Quiet. You don't have
to live like this.

58:51.428 --> 58:54.196
Get out. Out. Get out.

58:54.198 --> 58:56.098
Regain your dignity. Out.

59:12.883 --> 59:14.116
Seb.

59:16.253 --> 59:18.287
"The rapist."

59:18.289 --> 59:20.322
Hey.

59:20.324 --> 59:22.558
Nobody buggers me brother.

59:22.560 --> 59:25.427
A man can only take
so much jizz.

59:25.429 --> 59:27.195
Get off him!

59:35.806 --> 59:38.240
Aah!

59:41.078 --> 59:42.311
Wait.

59:42.313 --> 59:43.545
You're not Seb.

59:56.760 --> 59:59.061
You must be freezing.

01:00:00.297 --> 01:00:01.530
You.

01:00:01.532 --> 01:00:03.966
Pleasure to meet you,
Sebastian.

01:00:03.968 --> 01:00:06.201
I could understand why you
might want to kill

01:00:06.203 --> 01:00:08.337
the head of
the World Health Organization.

01:00:08.339 --> 01:00:10.505
Why bomb the final?

01:00:10.507 --> 01:00:12.341
Bomb?

01:00:12.343 --> 01:00:13.609
There is no bomb.

01:00:13.611 --> 01:00:15.811
It's a disease.

01:00:15.813 --> 01:00:19.081
It's a virus called RD-9.

01:00:19.083 --> 01:00:23.352
Or as I like to call it,
WorldCure.

01:00:23.354 --> 01:00:24.653
At the end of the game,

01:00:24.655 --> 01:00:27.089
everyone in the stadium
will be infected.

01:00:28.092 --> 01:00:29.691
It should take
two to three weeks

01:00:29.693 --> 01:00:31.593
for symptoms
to start showing up.

01:00:31.595 --> 01:00:33.228
By which time, 96,000 fans

01:00:33.230 --> 01:00:35.063
from almost every country
in the world

01:00:35.065 --> 01:00:37.532
will be back home,
spreading the disease.

01:00:37.534 --> 01:00:39.868
Why are you doing this?

01:00:39.870 --> 01:00:42.004
Well, think about it.

01:00:42.006 --> 01:00:44.206
We have 7 billion people
running around

01:00:44.208 --> 01:00:47.809
on a planet
that can only hold 5.

01:00:47.811 --> 01:00:49.144
I'm just trying
to make the world

01:00:49.146 --> 01:00:51.213
a better place,
that's all.

01:00:51.215 --> 01:00:52.814
By deleting the surplus.

01:00:52.816 --> 01:00:55.117
"Cure the world."

01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:58.620
And whom, exactly,
do you intend to delete?

01:00:58.622 --> 01:01:00.155
The garbage.

01:01:00.157 --> 01:01:02.624
The imbeciles
who lie around drunk,

01:01:02.626 --> 01:01:04.893
<i>reproducing like rabbits.</i>

01:01:04.895 --> 01:01:06.628
<i>And sitting there
with their hand out,</i>

01:01:06.630 --> 01:01:09.431
<i>expecting the rest of us
to pay.</i>

01:01:09.433 --> 01:01:12.834
And let's be frank,
who's gonna miss them anyway?

01:01:17.508 --> 01:01:18.974
Kill him.

01:01:58.515 --> 01:02:00.482
You're new to this.

01:02:02.619 --> 01:02:05.821
You ever killed
a man before?

01:02:35.986 --> 01:02:38.420
Are you gonna shoot me?

01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:44.459
No.

01:02:47.397 --> 01:02:51.466
How is it you English
football supporters say?

01:02:51.468 --> 01:02:52.868
Oh, yes.

01:02:55.139 --> 01:02:59.441
You're going to get
your bloody head kicked in.

01:02:59.443 --> 01:03:02.711
♪ Come and have a go if you
Think you're hard enough ♪

01:03:07.251 --> 01:03:08.450

01:03:22.432 --> 01:03:24.232
Get up.

<i>♪ I don't see nothing wrong ♪</i>

01:03:43.020 --> 01:03:45.754
Time to say goodbye to your

01:03:45.756 --> 01:03:48.523
hideous pig wife.

01:03:53.697 --> 01:03:56.765
Let me give you some advice,

01:03:56.767 --> 01:03:59.067
Ukrainian Ben Affleck.

01:04:00.704 --> 01:04:04.706
Never, ever slag off
a Grimsby lass.

01:04:04.708 --> 01:04:07.008
You don't have guts.

01:04:12.783 --> 01:04:14.049
Whoa.

01:04:14.051 --> 01:04:15.884
Well, that were easy.

01:04:19.790 --> 01:04:21.323
Hiya.

01:04:23.894 --> 01:04:25.360
Amazing.

01:04:25.362 --> 01:04:27.562
Gotta get one of these
for the kids.

01:04:28.565 --> 01:04:29.764
You have a family?

01:04:29.766 --> 01:04:32.400
I just reconnected
with mine.

01:04:36.874 --> 01:04:38.640
I'm going to go home and...

01:04:42.012 --> 01:04:44.346
This killing business
is a right laugh, isn't it?

01:04:45.415 --> 01:04:47.282
I understand why
you love guns so much.

01:04:47.284 --> 01:04:49.117
I mean, it completely
detaches you

01:04:49.119 --> 01:04:50.652
from the guilt
of your actions.

01:04:52.489 --> 01:04:54.222
Ta-da!

01:04:55.459 --> 01:04:56.758
Bonus point.

01:05:02.065 --> 01:05:05.166
Will you stop
shooting everything?

01:05:07.905 --> 01:05:10.805
<i>It's Germany 1, England 1,</i>

01:05:10.807 --> 01:05:13.541
<i>and it's anyone's final now.</i>

01:05:18.515 --> 01:05:21.917
Get that feed up. Come on.
I'm trying.

01:05:21.919 --> 01:05:24.019
<i>So little time remaining.</i>

01:05:24.021 --> 01:05:26.888
<i>Four minutes
to decide the final.</i>

01:05:26.890 --> 01:05:28.957
Mission accomplished.

01:05:28.959 --> 01:05:31.059
All we need
is England to score.

01:05:31.061 --> 01:05:32.661
This'll be the best day
of my life.

01:05:32.663 --> 01:05:36.865
What? Every man, woman and child
in this stadium is about to die.

01:05:36.867 --> 01:05:39.000
Put this in your ear.

01:05:39.002 --> 01:05:41.736
Jodie, I need you
to check for anywhere

01:05:41.738 --> 01:05:43.271
that might contain
the virus.

01:05:43.273 --> 01:05:46.808
Okay, I will scan
for the chemical signature.

01:05:46.810 --> 01:05:48.510
This is hopeless.

01:05:48.512 --> 01:05:49.978
No, it's not.

01:05:49.980 --> 01:05:52.047
Look who just sat down.

01:05:53.350 --> 01:05:55.450
We need to stop her
before she sets off the virus.

01:05:55.452 --> 01:05:57.352
All right, listen,
let's go around the stadium.

01:05:57.354 --> 01:05:59.187
We can't go around.
There's not enough time.

01:05:59.189 --> 01:06:01.423
We need to go across the pitch.

01:06:02.492 --> 01:06:03.692
Pitch invasion.

01:06:03.694 --> 01:06:05.226
Too much security.

01:06:05.228 --> 01:06:06.628
We'll never make it alone.

01:06:06.630 --> 01:06:08.163
Alone?

01:06:08.165 --> 01:06:10.231
We are not alone.

01:06:10.233 --> 01:06:12.167
<i>It's England who are looking</i>

01:06:12.169 --> 01:06:14.836
<i>the more likely
to steal a late winner.</i>

01:06:14.838 --> 01:06:16.104
Hey, give me that.

01:06:16.106 --> 01:06:17.472
Nobby! Sit down! Come on.

01:06:17.474 --> 01:06:19.207
Men and women of Grimsby,
listen up.

01:06:19.209 --> 01:06:21.042
This is important.

01:06:21.044 --> 01:06:23.878
You see that lass over there?

01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:25.347
What? Sharon Osbourne?

01:06:25.349 --> 01:06:29.150
No. She's gonna release
this deadly virus,

01:06:29.152 --> 01:06:32.253
and it's gonna kill
poor people like us,

01:06:32.255 --> 01:06:34.723
because she thinks
that we are scum.

01:06:34.725 --> 01:06:36.725
Bloody hell, Nobby,
we <i> are</i> scum.

01:06:36.727 --> 01:06:37.959
Well... Well, you are, Pete.

01:06:37.961 --> 01:06:39.561
You're a registered
sex offender.

01:06:39.563 --> 01:06:41.763
That's not a compliment.

01:06:41.765 --> 01:06:45.266
So we're scum, are we?

01:06:45.268 --> 01:06:48.470
Well, let me tell you
something about scum:

01:06:48.472 --> 01:06:51.139
It's scum who built
the hospitals

01:06:51.141 --> 01:06:52.841
that are now closing down.

01:06:52.843 --> 01:06:54.042
Yeah.

01:06:54.044 --> 01:06:56.177
It's scum who die in the wars

01:06:56.179 --> 01:06:58.480
started by the bastards
in charge.

01:06:58.482 --> 01:07:00.715
Yeah!
It's scum that keep

01:07:00.717 --> 01:07:03.985
the <i> Fast and Furious</i>
franchise alive.

01:07:03.987 --> 01:07:05.987
Yeah!

01:07:05.989 --> 01:07:09.391
So I ask you
to join with us now

01:07:09.393 --> 01:07:11.893
and storm that pitch...
Yeah!

01:07:11.895 --> 01:07:18.033
...and show the world that scum
cannot be washed away, ever.

01:07:18.035 --> 01:07:19.768
Yeah!

01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:25.640
Yeah!

01:07:36.219 --> 01:07:39.054
We are the scum!

01:07:47.798 --> 01:07:49.197
Yeah!

01:07:52.803 --> 01:07:54.769
We started too early.

01:07:54.771 --> 01:07:55.970
Whoo!

01:07:55.972 --> 01:07:58.640
It's Graves.

01:07:58.642 --> 01:08:00.442
Keep him away from me.

01:08:00.444 --> 01:08:02.944
Okay, the target is on the move.
I'll sync with your lens.

01:08:02.946 --> 01:08:06.081
Nobby, you ready
for a fight?

01:08:06.083 --> 01:08:08.116
I thought you'd never ask.

01:08:08.118 --> 01:08:10.018
Green Earth.

01:08:11.254 --> 01:08:12.754
Target heading
southwest

01:08:12.756 --> 01:08:14.289
through the German section.

01:08:25.969 --> 01:08:27.836
Come on.

01:08:33.810 --> 01:08:36.810
<i>Well, sanity has returned,
and so have the players.</i>

01:08:36.813 --> 01:08:40.381
<i>The show will go on.
The final will be restarted.</i>

01:08:40.383 --> 01:08:42.383
Jodie, where's the virus?

01:08:42.385 --> 01:08:44.352
<i>I still can't find it.</i>

01:08:46.223 --> 01:08:47.788
Nobby, meet the head

01:08:47.791 --> 01:08:50.859
of the biggest
crime syndicate in the world.

01:08:50.861 --> 01:08:52.560
What, she runs FIFA?

01:08:53.662 --> 01:08:55.363
Who's this idiot?

01:08:55.365 --> 01:08:58.099
His name's Sebastian.

01:08:58.100 --> 01:08:59.501
Boys!

01:09:01.738 --> 01:09:04.471
Oh, bollocks.

01:09:05.475 --> 01:09:06.674
Go!

01:09:13.950 --> 01:09:15.483
Quick! She's getting away!

01:09:27.697 --> 01:09:31.166
So we meet again.

01:09:32.569 --> 01:09:33.667
I found it.

01:09:33.670 --> 01:09:36.109
The virus is in
one of the fireworks.

01:09:37.774 --> 01:09:39.874
Shoot her before
she gets to the detonator.

01:09:39.876 --> 01:09:41.576
But what if I miss?

01:09:41.578 --> 01:09:43.243
I trust you.

01:09:47.917 --> 01:09:49.584
Oi!

01:09:49.586 --> 01:09:51.719
<i>Ten seconds.</i>

01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:55.557
<i>That's all that's left.
Oh, look at Sterling!</i>

01:09:56.860 --> 01:09:58.326
<i>What a chance!</i>

01:10:00.330 --> 01:10:03.298
<i>Oh, no!
It's going over the bar!</i>

01:10:03.300 --> 01:10:05.333
<i>Oh, no, it's not.</i>

01:10:07.204 --> 01:10:09.871
<i>But wait!
What's happened to the ball?</i>

01:10:09.873 --> 01:10:11.372
<i>It's bounced in!</i>

01:10:13.877 --> 01:10:16.244
<i>No, the referee's
gonna disallow it.</i>

01:10:18.448 --> 01:10:20.114
<i>The goal stands.</i>
Yes!

01:10:20.116 --> 01:10:21.316
<i>England have won it!</i>

01:10:21.318 --> 01:10:22.517
Come on, Nobby.

01:10:22.519 --> 01:10:24.185
Stop shooting everything
and focus.

01:10:24.187 --> 01:10:26.147
<i>Don't worry. I've got this.</i>

01:10:29.793 --> 01:10:32.694
Jodie, me gun's jammed.

01:10:37.500 --> 01:10:38.700
Oh, no.

01:10:39.502 --> 01:10:41.402
Excuse me, miss.

01:10:43.907 --> 01:10:45.340
Yes?

01:10:46.243 --> 01:10:47.842
Go fuck yourself!

01:10:47.844 --> 01:10:49.844
Aah!

01:10:49.846 --> 01:10:51.246
Yes!

01:10:52.515 --> 01:10:54.115
Yes!

01:10:54.117 --> 01:10:56.517
Yes! We did it, Seb!

01:10:57.354 --> 01:11:00.388
Yeah! Yeah!

01:11:01.258 --> 01:11:03.191
Sanjiv, now!

01:11:03.193 --> 01:11:06.294
Got it.
What? Please, no! No!

01:11:08.365 --> 01:11:10.531
Goodbye, Sebastian.

01:11:10.533 --> 01:11:13.701
No! No!

01:11:22.045 --> 01:11:23.444
Cure the world!

01:11:35.125 --> 01:11:37.358
No!

01:11:38.295 --> 01:11:39.627
Too late!

01:11:39.629 --> 01:11:41.629
There's no way to stop
the fireworks!

01:11:41.631 --> 01:11:43.464
I'll jump on them.
It won't work.

01:11:43.466 --> 01:11:45.199
The virus is in the tip
of the firework.

01:11:45.201 --> 01:11:46.734
It would need to explode

01:11:46.736 --> 01:11:49.203
<i>within a contained environment
to stop it spreading.</i>

01:11:49.205 --> 01:11:51.445
There's nothing
you can do.

01:11:52.208 --> 01:11:54.409
Yes, there is.

01:11:54.411 --> 01:11:56.611
I'm from Grimsby.

01:11:56.613 --> 01:11:59.881
Jodie, which firework is it in?

01:12:01.284 --> 01:12:03.384
It's in the central
left-hand rocket.

01:12:05.455 --> 01:12:08.923
What are you doing?
Contributing to society.

01:12:11.895 --> 01:12:13.561
Aah!

01:12:13.563 --> 01:12:16.731
Oh, Nobby. It's the firework
to your left, not my left.

01:12:16.733 --> 01:12:18.566
For fuck's sake!

01:12:24.674 --> 01:12:27.842
Tell my kids
that Daddy died with dignity.

01:12:29.479 --> 01:12:31.612
Nobby, can you hear me?
The firework next to you

01:12:31.614 --> 01:12:33.381
also has the virus.

01:12:34.351 --> 01:12:36.684
What? No.

01:12:36.686 --> 01:12:39.587
But I don't have
another asshole.

01:12:40.657 --> 01:12:44.492
I need another asshole.

01:12:46.529 --> 01:12:48.396
You've got one.

01:12:49.966 --> 01:12:52.734
I'm from Grimsby too...

01:12:52.736 --> 01:12:55.703
and I'm never gonna let you
leave me again.

01:13:05.281 --> 01:13:07.982
Oh, my God, Graves.

01:13:12.789 --> 01:13:16.357
Butcher Boys of Grimsby,
together...

01:13:16.359 --> 01:13:17.859
Forever.

01:13:46.723 --> 01:13:49.924
<i>Donald Trump has AIDS.</i>

01:13:49.926 --> 01:13:53.428
<i>Philanthropist Rhonda George
has been arrested.</i>

01:13:53.430 --> 01:13:56.898
<i>Middle East peace symbol
Schlomo Khalidi is in custody</i>

01:13:56.900 --> 01:14:00.168
<i>following the murder
of MI6 agent Jeremy Chilcott.</i>

01:14:00.170 --> 01:14:03.104
<i>I didn't do it. I've had
the worst week ever.</i>

01:14:03.106 --> 01:14:06.441
<i>- Israel.
- Palestine. all of you.</i>

01:14:06.443 --> 01:14:10.711
<i>England fans in high
spirits after Cup final victory.</i>

01:14:10.713 --> 01:14:13.714
<i>Rogue MI6 operative
Sebastian Graves</i>

01:14:13.716 --> 01:14:15.216
<i>and his brother
Nobby Butcher</i>

01:14:15.218 --> 01:14:17.518
<i>died at the scene while
preventing the release</i>

01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:18.920
<i>of a deadly toxin.</i>

01:14:18.922 --> 01:14:21.222
<i>In other news,
a South African hotel maid</i>

01:14:21.224 --> 01:14:23.658
<i>has filed a suit alleging
sexual assault</i>

01:14:23.660 --> 01:14:25.993
<i>by Oasis frontman
Liam Gallagher.</i>

01:14:25.995 --> 01:14:28.629
<i>Gallagher is also being sought
for abusing an elephant</i>

01:14:28.631 --> 01:14:32.800
<i>in conjunction with</i> Fast
and Furious <i> star Vin Diesel.</i>

01:14:34.504 --> 01:14:38.139
Naturally, you'll both
be needing new identities.

01:14:38.141 --> 01:14:39.841
How are you guys doing?

01:14:43.413 --> 01:14:45.213
How does me ass look?

01:14:48.384 --> 01:14:50.785
Good. Uh, really good.

01:14:50.787 --> 01:14:53.521
It's a bit smoky in here, Jodie.
Can we have the fan on, please?

01:14:53.523 --> 01:14:55.790
Uh, of course.

01:14:55.792 --> 01:14:57.725
So you were saved
from the virus

01:14:57.727 --> 01:15:00.194
by an antibody
found in elephant semen,

01:15:00.196 --> 01:15:01.696
which lined, uh...

01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:05.466
...your innards.

01:15:05.468 --> 01:15:08.169
We're like a pair
of pan pipes.

01:15:08.171 --> 01:15:09.670
Great.

01:15:09.672 --> 01:15:11.939
And I thought you were
going to be faithful, Sebastian.

01:15:11.941 --> 01:15:15.543
You know, you really filled
a hole in my life.

01:15:20.917 --> 01:15:22.116
Hiya!

01:15:22.118 --> 01:15:23.985
- Nobby.
- Dad.

01:15:23.987 --> 01:15:26.087
Oh, my God.

01:15:27.290 --> 01:15:29.957
I'm so glad that you're alive.

01:15:34.097 --> 01:15:35.663
You know what?

01:15:36.933 --> 01:15:38.165
Family.

01:15:42.438 --> 01:15:45.573
It's the greatest gift
in life.

01:15:47.410 --> 01:15:50.678
Stop throwing coins in there.
It's not a brown wishing well.

01:16:26.783 --> 01:16:29.584
<i>You are now transmitting.</i>

01:16:30.853 --> 01:16:33.354
<i>Stand by. Stand by.
Eyes on the target.</i>

01:16:42.131 --> 01:16:44.665
Listen, we're sending
information to your lens.

01:16:44.667 --> 01:16:46.667
<i>I've got this. Blue Earth.</i>

01:17:13.162 --> 01:17:14.161
Hiya, bruv.

01:17:14.163 --> 01:17:16.664
Good, you're early.
Yes, I am.

01:17:16.666 --> 01:17:18.065
Did you meet the team?

01:22:45.628 --> 01:22:48.329
Excuse me.
Which way to the stadium?

01:22:48.331 --> 01:22:51.732
Straight on for 5 kilometers,
then to the right.

01:22:51.734 --> 01:22:52.933
Thank you.

01:22:54.203 --> 01:22:56.136
Leave no witnesses.
