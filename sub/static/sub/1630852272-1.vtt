WEBVTT

01:44.939 --> 01:47.858
Today marks an important
milestone at invespia.

01:47.942 --> 01:52.029
Two years ago, we set out to architect
a cryptocurrency exchange

01:52.113 --> 01:56.033
that would elevate the trajectory
of global finances forever.

01:56.117 --> 01:58.828
Well, thanks to all of you,
I am humbled to announce

01:58.911 --> 02:02.248
that we have exceeded
our annual investment goals.

02:02.331 --> 02:08.713
I deeply appreciate the trust, friendship
and support of every invespia partner.

02:08.795 --> 02:12.008
Now, lknow it's become
a bit clichÃ© in the tech world,

02:12.091 --> 02:13.718
but this is not hyperbole

02:13.801 --> 02:19.223
when I say that we are in the process
of changing the world as we know it.

02:19.307 --> 02:20.474
[Chuckles]

02:21.559 --> 02:23.144
Yeah, dude.

02:23.227 --> 02:24.812
You're the fucking clichÃ©.

02:27.148 --> 02:28.566
[Exhales]

02:35.323 --> 02:37.074
[Tense music playing]

02:48.669 --> 02:50.338
Target on the move.
Local on standby.

02:52.757 --> 02:54.967
I'm sure you're wondering
what a handsome brit like me

02:55.051 --> 02:56.719
is doing all the way out here.

02:56.802 --> 02:59.680
Well, mate, this is a great place
to meet women.

02:59.764 --> 03:01.182
[Laughs]

03:01.265 --> 03:02.433
I tell, ya.

03:02.516 --> 03:04.602
And it's excellent,
as long as you know how to drive,

03:04.685 --> 03:07.104
the GPS does all the work
for you, right.

03:07.188 --> 03:08.731
Which is a good plan,

03:08.814 --> 03:11.192
as long as you're not driving
out in the middle of nowhere

03:11.275 --> 03:13.069
where the GPS don't work.

03:13.235 --> 03:16.822
I guess what I'm saying is
I hope you know where you're going.

03:18.616 --> 03:19.616
Hello?

03:21.077 --> 03:22.119
Where you going?

03:22.203 --> 03:23.621
Oh, yeah.

03:35.174 --> 03:36.509
It looks like it's the next left

03:36.592 --> 03:37.968
about three miles up.

03:39.387 --> 03:41.222
[Driver] You're traveling light.

03:41.305 --> 03:43.682
[Paul]
Yeah, just here for a business meeting.

03:43.766 --> 03:45.285
Actually, would you mind waiting for me?

03:45.309 --> 03:47.812
I'm, uh, gonna try to catch
the 3:00 outta here.

03:47.895 --> 03:51.482
Oh, sure. Do you want me
to grab you a coffee, as well?

03:51.565 --> 03:53.359
Milk, sugar?

03:53.442 --> 03:54.652
No, I'm not waiting.

03:54.735 --> 03:56.028
This ain't a limo.

03:56.112 --> 03:57.405
Okay.

03:58.656 --> 04:01.093
I mean, how am I supposed to
get another car if there's no GPS?

04:01.117 --> 04:03.178
[Driver] I don't know, mate.
That sounds like something

04:03.202 --> 04:04.721
you should've pre-planned,
don't you think?

04:04.745 --> 04:05.830
[Paul] Right.

04:10.126 --> 04:11.335
We lost contact.

05:10.728 --> 05:13.814
Hi, Robert.
This is a beautiful day today, isn't it?

05:13.898 --> 05:15.316
It sure is.

05:17.985 --> 05:20.404
Good morning, sir.
And how are you today?

05:20.488 --> 05:22.865
Another day in paradise.

05:24.366 --> 05:26.660
So we received an interesting call.

05:26.744 --> 05:27.912
[Robert] Interesting?

05:27.995 --> 05:29.330
From your son.

05:30.414 --> 05:33.584
I wasn't going to speak with him,
but he's coming for a visit.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.169
Everything okay?

05:35.252 --> 05:38.214
His flight has already landed.
I can't wait to meet him.

05:41.133 --> 05:43.219
Kate to base. Do you copy?

05:52.645 --> 05:54.188
[Grunts] [Chuckles]

05:55.898 --> 05:58.192
[Cell phone ringing]

05:58.943 --> 06:00.903
- Go for ulysses.
- [Man] Come on, man.

06:00.986 --> 06:02.154
Yes, sir.

06:02.238 --> 06:03.447
Copy that.

06:05.574 --> 06:07.326
They're telegraphing a bat cave.

06:14.208 --> 06:15.376
Ready for this?

06:21.799 --> 06:23.133
Listen up, everybody.

06:24.635 --> 06:29.306
The mission is simple;
Get in and get out quietly.

06:30.307 --> 06:32.518
Neutralize anybody
that stands in your way.

06:32.601 --> 06:36.105
Acquire the assets alive for the boss.

06:36.188 --> 06:38.274
- Am I clear?
- [All] Yes, sir.

06:41.193 --> 06:42.194
[Scoffs]

06:42.278 --> 06:43.487
Let's load up.

06:57.167 --> 06:58.794
[Door opens]

07:06.594 --> 07:07.803
Good god.

07:14.393 --> 07:15.394
What's that?

07:16.270 --> 07:18.355
This, mate, is where
you told me to take you.

07:25.738 --> 07:27.156
What's this all about?

07:29.867 --> 07:31.052
- Hey, how...
- [Guard] Please turn off

07:31.076 --> 07:33.162
your vehicle's engine, sir.

07:33.245 --> 07:36.415
This is private property.
No unauthorized vehicles are allowed

07:36.498 --> 07:37.618
- on our premises.
- Alright.

07:37.666 --> 07:40.085
They're expecting me.
My name's Paul Michaels.

07:40.169 --> 07:42.129
May I please see your
security access credentials?

07:42.171 --> 07:45.257
Credentials? I'm here to see my father,
Robert Michaels.

07:45.341 --> 07:47.319
Sorry, Mr. Michaels,
all visitors are required to have

07:47.343 --> 07:48.927
security clearance credentials.

07:49.011 --> 07:51.764
At a retirement community?
I mean, that-that's ridiculous.

07:53.891 --> 07:55.267
[Driver] Oh, hello.

07:55.351 --> 07:56.560
Hey, Matthews.

07:58.479 --> 07:59.647
Is this guy for real?

08:01.065 --> 08:02.566
Keep your eyes on them.

08:02.650 --> 08:03.734
Roger that.

08:05.903 --> 08:07.823
Mate, are you sure
you want me to leave you here?

08:07.905 --> 08:09.406
[Sighs] Tbd.

08:12.076 --> 08:13.786
It's alright,
Mr. Michaels is authorized.

08:13.869 --> 08:14.953
Yes, ma'am.

08:15.954 --> 08:17.831
[Driver] Guy a friend of yours?

08:17.915 --> 08:18.957
[Paul] Not yet.

08:19.458 --> 08:20.709
Bloody hell.

08:20.793 --> 08:22.419
The Terminator's coming back.

08:22.503 --> 08:24.380
Mr. Michael, you're free to enter.

08:24.463 --> 08:25.798
Just you.

08:27.466 --> 08:29.885
Mate, where I'm from,
getting rescued by a beautiful woman,

08:29.968 --> 08:31.071
that's a good piece of luck.

08:31.095 --> 08:33.097
Definitely a step up from you,
my friend.

08:33.179 --> 08:34.682
[Driver chuckles]

08:42.731 --> 08:44.316
We got last known location.

08:48.195 --> 08:49.321
Let's move.

08:51.156 --> 08:53.701
[Mutters]

08:53.784 --> 08:55.994
[Speaks Spanish]

09:10.676 --> 09:13.303
Kate Taylor. I'm the director here.

09:13.387 --> 09:14.847
Nice to meet you, miss Taylor.

09:14.930 --> 09:17.307
Miss Taylor sounds rather like
a junior high teacher.

09:17.891 --> 09:18.892
Call me Kate.

09:18.976 --> 09:21.854
[Chuckles] What's with
the fort Knox routine, Kate?

09:21.937 --> 09:23.814
Just a formality, Mr. Michaels.

09:23.897 --> 09:25.297
Well, if you're Kate then I'm Paul.

09:26.316 --> 09:27.818
Fair enough.

09:27.901 --> 09:29.737
I've heard a lot about you, Paul.

09:29.820 --> 09:32.197
Oh, yeah? What'd you hear?

09:32.281 --> 09:34.074
Your dad is very proud of you.

09:34.158 --> 09:36.785
Is he?
Are we talking about the same guy?

09:37.745 --> 09:39.246
I'll escort him from here.

09:40.539 --> 09:41.999
[Keypad beeping]

09:47.045 --> 09:49.047
So, what is this place?

09:50.007 --> 09:51.651
I mean, I thought this was
a retirement community,

09:51.675 --> 09:52.715
what's up with the guards?

09:52.760 --> 09:55.763
They take their jobs here quite seriously,
as well they should.

09:55.846 --> 10:00.350
Forge mountain is an invitation-only,
one-ofâ€”a-kind destination retreat

10:00.434 --> 10:02.269
for executives in need of a reset.

10:02.352 --> 10:04.021
Invitation-only retreat?

10:04.104 --> 10:05.606
Marketing lingo.

10:05.689 --> 10:08.567
Basically, we have a network
of corporate partners

10:08.650 --> 10:11.653
and offer a variety of on-site
programs for their executives.

10:11.737 --> 10:13.757
I thought you said my father
had been living here for years.

10:13.781 --> 10:15.115
Also true.

10:15.199 --> 10:17.910
We have a very few
who are long-term residents.

10:17.993 --> 10:20.496
Never would've imagined my dad
living in a place like this.

10:20.579 --> 10:22.915
Wasn't much of an outdoorsman
when I was a kid.

10:22.998 --> 10:26.418
Well, I'm sure you two have
quite a lot to catch up on.

10:35.260 --> 10:36.762
I'm still getting nothing.

10:40.182 --> 10:41.642
That's fine.

10:41.725 --> 10:43.143
They can't have gotten far.

10:43.227 --> 10:45.187
We'll catch up and intercept them.

10:51.902 --> 10:55.864
Ah, did they warn you
of the communication challenges here?

10:59.117 --> 11:03.038
The original architects in the '503
labeled it an energy vortex.

11:03.121 --> 11:05.123
And what's that mean exactly?

11:05.457 --> 11:07.960
An area conducive to spiritual healing.

11:08.043 --> 11:09.545
Sounds very scientific.

11:09.628 --> 11:11.421
[Chuckles] The scientific explanation

11:11.505 --> 11:14.675
is that there's a large concentration
of a rare iron ore

11:14.758 --> 11:16.426
that scrambles the electromagnetic waves,

11:16.510 --> 11:19.388
making satellite communication
next to impossible.

11:19.471 --> 11:21.831
It's called "native dead space"
in the satellite tech world.

11:22.933 --> 11:24.994
I was hell-bent on a career
at NASA when I was a kid.

11:25.018 --> 11:27.354
I was obsessed with the place
beyond the sky.

11:27.437 --> 11:29.022
- You know?
- Oh.

11:29.106 --> 11:30.774
So, did you do it?

11:30.858 --> 11:34.403
Well, my mother was a music teacher
and my dad sold medical devices.

11:34.486 --> 11:36.071
Not exactly astronaut pedigree.

11:36.154 --> 11:37.656
- Yeah.
- But I play a mean recorder.

11:37.781 --> 11:38.866
[Kate laughs]

11:41.243 --> 11:42.327
[Tires screech]

11:43.495 --> 11:45.372
- [Horn honks]
- What's going on?

11:48.458 --> 11:49.960
Howdy, thanks for stopping.

11:50.043 --> 11:51.753
Not like I had a lot of choice, was it?

11:51.837 --> 11:54.339
Listen, we're part of
a special forces team for the DEA,

11:54.423 --> 11:55.608
and we're gonna need your help.

11:55.632 --> 11:56.842
My help?

11:56.925 --> 11:59.261
Yes. Can you give me the address
of your last drop off?

11:59.344 --> 12:02.306
[Chuckles] Look, mate,
I can't give you the addresses...

12:02.389 --> 12:05.142
It's very urgent.
See, the man that you just dropped off...

12:06.476 --> 12:09.521
Well, he's transporting a very deadly,
new synthetic drug.

12:09.605 --> 12:11.648
Look, mate, I don't
want to get involved, honestly.

12:11.732 --> 12:12.834
I'm late for where I'm going.

12:12.858 --> 12:14.377
Hey, can we move this shit
out of the road?

12:14.401 --> 12:15.903
I wanna go!

12:15.986 --> 12:18.488
- Are you guys serious?
- Do I not look serious?

12:21.825 --> 12:23.702
Yeah, look, you do, but...

12:23.785 --> 12:26.055
Look, mate, you gotta talk to the company
if you want that sort of information.

12:26.079 --> 12:27.247
I could lose my job over...

12:27.331 --> 12:28.665
[Choking]

12:28.749 --> 12:31.376
You're gonna lose a lot more
than your job, friend.

12:34.796 --> 12:37.633
Look... there wasn't an address.

12:37.716 --> 12:40.302
The guy had directions
on a piece of paper.

12:40.385 --> 12:41.929
That's it!

12:42.012 --> 12:43.805
I can't remember anything else.

12:43.889 --> 12:44.890
Think.

12:45.015 --> 12:46.934
[Choking]

12:47.017 --> 12:48.101
Fuck.

12:48.185 --> 12:49.978
Okay. Okay, alright.

12:50.896 --> 12:54.983
It's about ten miles down
on county line 12.

12:55.067 --> 12:56.987
There's a dirt road on the left,
there's no sign,

12:57.027 --> 12:58.946
it's just a dirt road.

12:59.029 --> 13:01.490
There's a gate... opens to the gate.

13:01.573 --> 13:04.034
There's guards at the gate at the end.

13:04.117 --> 13:07.204
- Are they armed?
- Yeah. Yeah.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.752
[Panting]

13:15.587 --> 13:16.880
Thank you for your help.

13:20.550 --> 13:24.554
Hey, you expect a strongly-worded
email to the DEA!

13:24.638 --> 13:26.181
I know my rights!

13:29.893 --> 13:31.770
Hey, you tell your partner to...

13:31.853 --> 13:33.063
[Man] Nothing personal.

13:33.146 --> 13:35.649
- Hey... wait, wait...
- [Gunshot]

13:58.213 --> 13:59.399
Please, don't take this wrong,

13:59.423 --> 14:01.842
but I'm curious to know how you
found your father was here.

14:01.925 --> 14:04.428
Our residents have a saying
that anonymity

14:04.511 --> 14:07.806
is forge mountain's
most attractive amenity.

14:07.889 --> 14:09.474
Sorry to pry.

14:09.558 --> 14:11.018
Don't be sorry.

14:11.101 --> 14:13.520
I'm sure it's not a secret,
we haven't spoken in a long time.

14:15.480 --> 14:18.400
An attorney that manages
my mother's family estate

14:18.483 --> 14:19.776
put me in touch.

14:19.860 --> 14:21.403
I'm sure he's excited to see you.

14:21.486 --> 14:23.155
[Paul chuckles]

14:23.238 --> 14:24.656
Really?

14:26.408 --> 14:28.368
You're not a great liar, Kate.

14:28.452 --> 14:31.830
Alright, in all honesty,
he was completely shocked.

14:31.913 --> 14:34.207
But I'm sure he's happy to see you.

14:36.543 --> 14:38.545
Ah, here we have all the amenities:

14:38.628 --> 14:42.424
Pool, target range,
river with loads of fish.

14:42.507 --> 14:43.508
And in the summer months

14:43.592 --> 14:46.011
there are so many grandkids
and nieces and nephews,

14:46.094 --> 14:47.679
it becomes a perfect playground.

14:47.763 --> 14:49.431
You're very passionate about the place.

14:49.514 --> 14:50.766
I am.

14:51.683 --> 14:52.726
[Sighs]

14:52.809 --> 14:56.229
We have our dining hall,
michelin starred chef.

14:56.313 --> 15:00.150
And loads of outdoor activities:
Yoga and tai chi

15:00.233 --> 15:01.610
and a book reading club.

15:02.360 --> 15:04.613
Well, everyone seems very happy.

15:04.696 --> 15:06.156
You must be doing something right.

15:07.115 --> 15:10.118
- [Groans]
- And loads of bugs. [Chuckles]

15:14.581 --> 15:16.416
[Tense music playing]

16:11.638 --> 16:15.976
Strange, boss, I've got no overhead
of that entire forest.

16:16.059 --> 16:17.435
It's like some black hole.

16:20.772 --> 16:23.567
Got eyes on the dirt road
the driver says ends at the gate.

16:25.068 --> 16:26.403
I got no map of that.

16:30.615 --> 16:32.242
Now look at the clearing in the trees.

16:33.201 --> 16:35.495
[Woman] Perimeter fencing.

16:35.579 --> 16:37.914
That's a lot of land.

16:37.998 --> 16:40.250
What is that place?

16:40.333 --> 16:43.503
Got a few ideas.
Only one way to find out.

16:43.587 --> 16:44.629
Move out.

16:54.514 --> 16:57.809
It appears the target
has moved into some sort of compound.

16:58.894 --> 17:00.937
[Indistinct]

17:01.605 --> 17:04.107
Zero visibility and likely
no outside communication.

17:04.191 --> 17:05.608
Over.

17:05.692 --> 17:07.461
[Man on radio]
Infiltrate and secure the targets.

17:07.484 --> 17:09.112
Use any means necessary.

17:09.195 --> 17:11.781
Targets must be taken alive.
I'm on my way.

17:12.781 --> 17:14.034
Copy that, sir.

17:29.591 --> 17:31.635
[Kate] These are the long-term
resident cottages.

17:31.718 --> 17:34.262
A bit more roomy and much more secluded.

17:34.346 --> 17:35.847
And here we are.

17:44.356 --> 17:45.482
[Door opens]

17:48.777 --> 17:50.528
Good to see you, Paul.

17:50.612 --> 17:51.863
[Door closes]

17:53.365 --> 17:54.532
Hey, dad.

17:59.287 --> 18:02.374
Oh... okay, then.
I'll let you two catch up.

18:02.457 --> 18:03.583
[Robert] Thanks, Kate.

18:03.708 --> 18:07.587
Come inside. Relax.

18:07.671 --> 18:08.713
Come on.

18:11.258 --> 18:12.801
[Tense music playing]

18:24.020 --> 18:25.063
[Robert] Take a seat.

18:30.902 --> 18:32.487
You look well, dad.

18:32.570 --> 18:34.489
I stay busy.

18:36.116 --> 18:37.659
Well, that's good, you'll live longer.

18:37.742 --> 18:39.744
- [Chuckles]
- Yeah, that's what they say.

18:41.496 --> 18:43.915
So I saw the prairie view house sold.

18:46.501 --> 18:47.836
I loved that house.

18:49.421 --> 18:51.423
We had some good times there.

18:54.884 --> 18:58.096
Did, uh... did uncle bill
or aunt Katie get in touch with you?

19:00.223 --> 19:03.351
Not since your, uh, your mom died.

19:03.435 --> 19:05.478
Dad, you vanished.

19:05.562 --> 19:07.147
I tried to contact you for years.

19:07.230 --> 19:09.316
It was a difficult time.

19:09.399 --> 19:12.485
Yeah, well, that's no reason
to shut everyone out and disappear.

19:12.569 --> 19:14.779
Look, I know emotions ran high
after the funeral,

19:14.863 --> 19:16.239
but that was three years ago.

19:17.699 --> 19:19.492
We need to try
to put things back together.

19:21.953 --> 19:25.665
I think we should have a...
A serious talk.

19:28.001 --> 19:30.795
Yeah, there is, uh,
something I'd like to talk to you about.

19:32.422 --> 19:35.342
But I'm-I'm gonna hit
the bathroom first, if you don't mind.

19:39.637 --> 19:41.848
[Tense music playing]

20:08.750 --> 20:10.543
Got a security cam, over.

20:12.295 --> 20:14.297
What are we walking into here, boss?

20:14.381 --> 20:16.299
Doesn't matter, the job is clear.

20:23.306 --> 20:25.141
[Tense music playing]

20:53.461 --> 20:55.088

[Water running]

21:07.934 --> 21:09.185
[Door closes]

21:18.445 --> 21:19.779
You can do this, Paul.

21:20.905 --> 21:22.073
You deserve this.

21:26.161 --> 21:27.203
Okay.

21:29.622 --> 21:31.791
You heard of cryptocurrency, dad?

21:31.875 --> 21:33.251
Digital assets.

21:33.918 --> 21:35.336
You've heard of bitcoin, right?

21:35.420 --> 21:36.796
Yeah, sure.

21:36.880 --> 21:41.759
Well, I wanna show you how our marketplace
streams transactions in real time.

21:41.843 --> 21:43.636
Just like a stock exchange.

21:46.639 --> 21:48.057
Real time, huh?

21:49.642 --> 21:50.685
Okay.

21:50.768 --> 21:52.270
Glad you're excited.

21:52.353 --> 21:55.064
- What?
- There's no WiFi here.

21:55.148 --> 21:56.441
[Chuckles]

21:57.901 --> 21:59.944
This is my company.

22:00.028 --> 22:01.237
Invespia.

22:01.321 --> 22:04.199
Ah. How'd you get online?

22:04.282 --> 22:06.618
My entire existence resides in the ether.

22:06.701 --> 22:09.329
I can get online
from the bottom of the ocean.

22:09.412 --> 22:13.041
You know, I lived and breathed
this company for the past five years.

22:13.124 --> 22:15.436
We're gonna revolutionize
the world's relationship to money.

22:15.460 --> 22:19.130
We have a ten-year road map
that will not only solidify invespia

22:19.214 --> 22:20.965
as an industry leader in cryptocurrency,

22:21.049 --> 22:23.927
but as a major player
in the global financial marketplace.

22:26.554 --> 22:28.473
I'm really happy for you, son.

22:36.064 --> 22:37.384
What do you got there, kitty cat?

22:38.691 --> 22:40.777
Magnetic plastic putty.

22:40.860 --> 22:42.862
Scrambles the camera signal,

22:42.946 --> 22:45.365
doesn't send a hardware failure alert.

22:45.448 --> 22:47.367
[Ulysses on radio] On my signal, Alpha.

22:47.450 --> 22:48.952
Don't miss.

22:57.585 --> 22:59.671
Miss garner, I've got a camera down.

23:07.845 --> 23:10.306
[Garner] Yeah, looks like
another wiring short.

23:10.390 --> 23:13.393
Damn ambrosia beetles chew up the cables.

23:14.477 --> 23:15.937
Just take it offline for now.

23:17.522 --> 23:18.648
Okay.

23:22.026 --> 23:26.739
You know what, send a north boundary
patrol down to check it out.

23:28.616 --> 23:29.993
Roger that, ma'am.

23:33.746 --> 23:35.081
Alpha team, go.

24:04.569 --> 24:06.112
Jones, do you copy?

24:07.405 --> 24:10.158
Jones, come in for base camp.
Do you copy?

24:11.451 --> 24:12.619
[Exhales]

24:12.702 --> 24:16.080
We've, uh...
We've hit a bump in the road.

24:16.164 --> 24:19.584
A key investor's pulled out
at the worst possible time...

24:20.918 --> 24:25.506
Pushing the exchange
to the verge of destabilization.

24:25.590 --> 24:26.841
Sounds rough.

24:26.924 --> 24:28.843
What are your options?

24:28.926 --> 24:30.720
We need a quick injection of cash.

24:30.803 --> 24:34.849
A stop gap, until I can finalize
a pending strategic merger.

24:36.684 --> 24:37.727
How much?

24:39.020 --> 24:40.146
Five million.

24:41.189 --> 24:42.398
Five million?

24:43.775 --> 24:45.943
Does it look like I have five million?

24:51.282 --> 24:52.283
What's this?

24:52.367 --> 24:54.535
Closing documents for a short-term loan.

24:57.205 --> 24:58.539
What collateral?

24:58.623 --> 25:00.708
Guess the land in my mom's family trust.

25:00.792 --> 25:02.085
Is this a joke?

25:12.136 --> 25:14.180
We've got a local.
Hold your positions.

Turn to channel three.

He's got a sidearm.

25:42.959 --> 25:44.752
Hold. Hold.

25:45.712 --> 25:48.339
I have every right
to borrow against my inheritance.

25:48.423 --> 25:49.549
It's not yours yet.

25:49.632 --> 25:51.300
That's why I'm asking for your help.

25:53.845 --> 25:55.680
You only came here for money.

25:58.057 --> 25:59.267
I shoulda known.

25:59.350 --> 26:00.601
You disappeared.

26:00.685 --> 26:02.687
I haven't heard from you in three years.

26:02.770 --> 26:03.771
Nobody has.

26:03.855 --> 26:05.606
Bullshit.

26:05.690 --> 26:06.983
You know nothing.

26:19.287 --> 26:20.747
Well, so far so good.

26:20.830 --> 26:23.070
- What's the plan?
- We'll take him when he doubles back.

26:23.124 --> 26:24.444
That camera will be back up soon.

26:24.500 --> 26:27.128
Better he sees a hole in the fence
than nine commandos.

26:27.211 --> 26:28.254
Copy that.

26:32.717 --> 26:35.136
Your mother never wanted that money.

26:36.345 --> 26:39.140
She turned her back on the family, not me.

26:40.308 --> 26:42.393
- Why?
- It's complicated.

26:42.477 --> 26:43.853
[Scoffs]

26:43.936 --> 26:46.105
Yeah, well, life's complicated, dad.

26:46.189 --> 26:48.858
Especially if you don't
run away from it and hide.

26:53.070 --> 26:55.615
Look, this is my last chance.

26:55.698 --> 26:57.909
Everything I've built is about to implode.

I know it's been
a difficult couple of years.

27:02.830 --> 27:06.125
But for the first time in my life
I need your help.

27:06.209 --> 27:08.336
You don't understand.

27:10.129 --> 27:11.214
[Scoffs]

27:12.381 --> 27:14.050
No, I understand everything.

27:15.259 --> 27:17.845
You've been absent my whole life,
work always came first.

27:17.929 --> 27:20.014
I had to teach myself how to be a man.

27:20.473 --> 27:22.475
Even when mom got sick.

27:23.851 --> 27:25.686
You left me to take care of her, too.

27:26.771 --> 27:28.898
Is that why you got
the old photo album out,

27:28.981 --> 27:30.441
to remember who I am?

27:31.609 --> 27:33.152
This was a huge mistake.

27:49.252 --> 27:52.129
It's almost time, my shift is over.

27:53.923 --> 27:55.383
We should take this guy out.

27:56.884 --> 27:58.386
Hold your position.

27:59.887 --> 28:02.306
There's a hole in that fucking fence.

28:02.390 --> 28:03.933
Do we have a problem?

28:04.016 --> 28:06.561
No problem, boss. Standing by.

28:06.644 --> 28:07.895
Listen to me. Listen to me.

28:07.979 --> 28:11.107
I've been on sites like this,
the government sets these traps.

If they hit the alarm,
we're all fucking cooked.

think you're doing, soldier?

We have to lockdown immediately.

compromises the mission,

you will be removed without hesitation.

and secure the targets alive.

It's him.

46:10.393 --> 46:11.853
What does he want?

46:19.444 --> 46:22.489
We've deployed an elite
ex-delta force master sergeant

46:22.572 --> 46:24.366
to do recon at the section of the forest

46:24.449 --> 46:27.243
we believe to be the origin
of the sniper fire.

46:27.327 --> 46:30.088
He will be our ace-in-the-hole
to help us understand what's out there.

46:31.081 --> 46:32.415
I'll leave you guys to it.

46:33.458 --> 46:34.960
And what about the ground crew?

46:37.712 --> 46:40.131
We detected seven on thermal imaging,

46:40.215 --> 46:42.592

finds in the forest.

fort baker for support.

46:47.305 --> 46:49.724
They wouldn't get here in time anyway.

46:49.808 --> 46:52.852
We pulled back the main security force
to the auxiliary building

46:52.936 --> 46:54.104
just to our north.

46:54.187 --> 46:55.855
How many left?

46:55.939 --> 46:59.317
Five security guards and sergeant blain.

47:00.360 --> 47:02.153
So they're sitting ducks out there.

47:02.237 --> 47:04.072
Let's not underestimate sergeant blain.

47:04.155 --> 47:07.450
He's here because he assassinated
a dictator in broad daylight.

47:07.534 --> 47:10.036
[Garner] Well, maybe if you told us
who this balzary is,

47:10.120 --> 47:12.330
we could put a goddamn plan together.

47:12.414 --> 47:13.623
That's need to know.

47:15.000 --> 47:17.585
What I can tell you
is that he's a notorious criminal

47:17.669 --> 47:19.379

you've killed people?

Of course.

49:36.141 --> 49:38.393
So this place
is some kind of government hideout?

51:46.771 --> 51:47.981
Agree, general.

51:48.064 --> 51:50.566
The facility was designed
to temporarily safeguard

51:50.650 --> 51:53.486
against enemy attacks
and natural disasters, but...

51:54.279 --> 51:56.072
Balzary's made contact, general.

51:57.991 --> 51:59.158
Patch him in.

52:02.453 --> 52:06.708
Mr. Balzary, I didn't peg you
for an outdoorsman.

52:08.334 --> 52:13.256
It's true, the riviera
is more suited to my tastes.

52:13.339 --> 52:15.591
And why are you in possession
of one of my radios?

52:15.675 --> 52:18.928
Well, I can assure you
that its previous owner

52:19.012 --> 52:21.264
has no further use for it,

52:21.347 --> 52:25.101
as I stare here
at his dead, rotting corpse.

52:25.476 --> 52:29.272
All I can really say is, it's gross.

52:30.773 --> 52:32.233
Enough with the pleasantries.

52:33.234 --> 52:36.195
I have a serious grievance
with you and your government.

52:36.279 --> 52:38.740
It's your government, too,
or did you just forget about

52:38.823 --> 52:40.134
your American birth certificate?

52:40.158 --> 52:42.160
I renounced that alliance long ago.

52:42.243 --> 52:44.704
I am now a citizen of the world.

52:45.788 --> 52:47.915
You know, I can send you
to our compliance department,

52:47.999 --> 52:49.876
but I'm warning you, Frederick,

52:49.959 --> 52:52.128
there's a very long waiting list.

52:52.211 --> 52:56.674
Forgive me for not politely chuckling
at your attempt at wit, general.

52:56.758 --> 52:58.509
But I'm not in the laughing mood.

52:58.593 --> 53:01.596
You've stolen a tremendous amount
of money from my business.

53:01.679 --> 53:03.222
Money that did not belong to me,

53:03.306 --> 53:06.642
money that my clients are holding me
personally responsible for.

53:07.769 --> 53:09.062
Alright, that's old news.

53:09.145 --> 53:11.606
Tell that to my wife,

53:11.689 --> 53:17.487
being held captive in some siberian
hell hole while you make snide jokes.

53:20.281 --> 53:25.745
Did you know, general,
that each and every day,

53:25.828 --> 53:30.708
that same Russian mob
sends me a new video of my wife.

53:32.210 --> 53:37.090
And if you were to see just one,
just one single video...

53:38.758 --> 53:41.594
I promise you would not be laughing.

53:41.677 --> 53:43.805
Deals with the devil are tricky that way.

53:44.680 --> 53:48.434
Funny, you are quite the comedian.

53:50.978 --> 53:52.313
Speaking of the devil...

53:54.315 --> 53:59.237
Can I speak with my once friend
and confidant, my own personal Judas?

54:00.321 --> 54:01.447
Put Robert on.

54:01.531 --> 54:04.158
[Dobbs] Robert's not here.
Alright, and the money is gone.

54:07.662 --> 54:10.373
Correction, it was gone...

54:11.791 --> 54:12.959
Until I found it.

54:19.590 --> 54:22.260
Ahh, silence, I love that sound.

54:22.343 --> 54:24.470
That's right, I found it.

54:24.554 --> 54:28.141
All of it, in fact,
still locked away

54:28.224 --> 54:32.228
in that little electronic treasure chest
at the bottom of the cyber ocean

54:32.311 --> 54:36.023
just waiting.
Just waiting to be opened.

54:36.107 --> 54:41.779
You see, that's the nice thing
about money, don't you think, general?

54:42.864 --> 54:47.243
It's patient.
Very patient, I love that.

54:48.202 --> 54:51.539
Now, I just need Robert to make like
the little pirate he is and open it.

54:51.622 --> 54:53.958
Yeah, that's impossible.

54:54.041 --> 54:57.086
Enough chit-chat, general.

54:57.170 --> 54:59.380
You either figure it out
or I'm on my way.

54:59.464 --> 55:01.215
That is not gonna happen.

55:02.925 --> 55:04.010
Oh, it is.

55:04.093 --> 55:06.679
I promise you it is.
It is inevitable.

55:06.762 --> 55:10.057
I will be knocking on your door.

55:10.141 --> 55:13.269
The only question I have for you, general,

55:13.352 --> 55:16.647
as it falls upon your shoulders
if you don't figure this out...

55:17.732 --> 55:22.111
How many people must die first?

55:37.835 --> 55:40.796
Dad... what was that all about?

55:44.467 --> 55:49.388
I spent six years...
Trying to get that bastard.

55:50.932 --> 55:53.267
I infiltrated his inner circle.

55:56.479 --> 56:00.525
That's where I was
when your mother was dying.

56:04.487 --> 56:07.698
I told myself I was doing the right thing.

56:08.407 --> 56:10.368
But it was all for nothing.

56:11.494 --> 56:13.621
No, it wasn't.

56:15.581 --> 56:16.707
[Dobbs] Kate's right.

56:18.084 --> 56:20.211
When Robert made his move,

56:20.294 --> 56:21.462
it was brilliant.

56:24.298 --> 56:26.926
He wiped out balzary's working capital.

56:27.718 --> 56:30.513
Six-hundred million
gone with the click of a button.

56:30.596 --> 56:35.393
It disrupted arms deals, drug running,
human trafficking, you name it.

56:35.476 --> 56:38.729
And he gave law enforcement
a moment to catch their breath.

56:39.772 --> 56:42.108
It was the pinnacle
of an outstanding career.

56:42.191 --> 56:46.529
If he found that money,
my career would be shit.

56:47.363 --> 56:49.323
He wouldn't be here if he already had it.

56:49.407 --> 56:52.201
He found the shipwreck account,
a virtual treasure chest,

56:52.285 --> 56:56.372
without a key, and he believes that Robert
is the only one that can open it.

56:59.417 --> 57:02.295
It can't be a coincidence
they got here at the same time as me.

57:03.796 --> 57:05.381
They must've followed me here.

57:07.758 --> 57:08.759
This is my fault.

57:08.843 --> 57:11.137
- It's not your fault, Paul.
- It is.

57:11.220 --> 57:14.640
He would've gotten me.
Sooner or later.

57:15.683 --> 57:17.476
Look, I hate to say it, but...

57:19.228 --> 57:21.731
They gonna probably use you as leverage.

57:21.814 --> 57:23.107
I'm not gonna let that happen.

57:37.330 --> 57:39.040
[Tense music playing]

57:42.168 --> 57:44.587
[Grunting]

57:54.096 --> 57:55.556
[Groaning]

58:01.854 --> 58:03.272
[Man] Get ready, he's coming.

58:07.234 --> 58:09.236
- [Gunshots]
- [Yelling]

58:10.780 --> 58:11.947
[Yells]

58:31.884 --> 58:33.427
[Man] It's this way, over here.

58:35.763 --> 58:37.264
Grenade!

58:37.890 --> 58:39.600
[Explosion]

58:40.226 --> 58:42.978
Security team neutralized. All clear.

58:50.444 --> 58:51.862
What's the list for?

58:51.946 --> 58:54.740
Just making sure we know
who to look for when this is all over.

58:54.824 --> 58:56.117
Good call.

58:57.118 --> 58:59.620
Though I don't think we're gonna find
too many alive out there.

59:01.956 --> 59:03.290
I have to try.

59:04.917 --> 59:06.460
[Sighs]

59:08.129 --> 59:10.256
You know that path
that leads along the river?

59:12.758 --> 59:16.011
If you go into the forest
about 200 meters,

59:16.095 --> 59:18.389
you're gonna come upon
a hidden ammo silo.

59:22.351 --> 59:23.769
Why are you telling me this?

59:25.104 --> 59:26.397
Just a hunch.

59:31.026 --> 59:33.362
Alright, they need us out there.
Come on, let's go.

59:36.240 --> 59:38.659
- [Monitor beeping]
- [Typing]

59:49.754 --> 59:53.174
Balzary's team has broken through
our final stronghold.

59:54.216 --> 59:56.719
That was the last of our armed guards.

59:58.387 --> 01:00:01.098
Won't be long until those mercenaries
are knocking on our door.

01:00:02.767 --> 01:00:04.226
But we're secure, right?

01:00:04.310 --> 01:00:09.106
[Scoffs] The fortress
was built 70 years ago.

01:00:09.190 --> 01:00:11.817
Explosive devices have evolved since then.

01:00:13.486 --> 01:00:15.571
We should prepare to defend ourselves.

01:00:17.072 --> 01:00:19.158
[Beeping]

01:00:19.241 --> 01:00:21.744
Why's it gotta be so damn complicated?

01:00:21.827 --> 01:00:24.246
Uh, try the button far left.

01:00:25.039 --> 01:00:26.165
[Paul chuckles softly]

01:00:30.795 --> 01:00:33.088
Well, I don't know how I missed that.

01:00:33.172 --> 01:00:34.840
Been that kinda day, I guess.

01:00:40.471 --> 01:00:41.555
How you holding up?

01:00:42.973 --> 01:00:44.016
From what?

01:00:44.099 --> 01:00:45.100
Almost getting killed

01:00:45.184 --> 01:00:48.437
or finding out my entire childhood
was based on a lie?

01:00:53.651 --> 01:00:55.611
We hadn't spoke in a long time, you know.

01:00:57.738 --> 01:00:59.532
Even after my mom died...

01:01:00.783 --> 01:01:02.576
Neither of us really put in the effort.

01:01:04.912 --> 01:01:07.248
At least now I understand
it wasn't my fault.

01:01:09.834 --> 01:01:12.294
People like Robert and I,
we choose this life.

01:01:13.295 --> 01:01:15.589
And before we realize
the cost to our loved ones,

01:01:15.673 --> 01:01:18.801
we're in so deep that we can do nothing
but continue to see it through.

01:01:21.136 --> 01:01:26.517
But I've never met a man
more proud of his family than your dad.

01:01:28.435 --> 01:01:30.145
You wanna know the last time he called me?

01:01:30.896 --> 01:01:32.314
Three years ago.

01:01:32.398 --> 01:01:34.233
Tell me about my mother's funeral.

01:01:34.316 --> 01:01:36.819
[Footsteps approaching]

01:01:36.902 --> 01:01:39.905
Excuse me, general dobbs,
they need you in the command center.

01:01:39.989 --> 01:01:41.824
Tell them I'll be right there.

01:01:46.287 --> 01:01:49.999
Your dad had to sever all ties with you
in order to keep you safe.

01:01:52.251 --> 01:01:54.461
With all this going on,
surely you can see why.

01:01:58.674 --> 01:02:00.259
But he missed you every single day.

01:02:21.238 --> 01:02:22.364
Miss garner...

01:02:23.949 --> 01:02:24.992
They're here.

01:02:31.498 --> 01:02:33.208
[Tense music playing]

01:02:41.091 --> 01:02:44.678
Okay. Let's get into position.

01:02:49.934 --> 01:02:51.101
[Beeps]

01:03:00.152 --> 01:03:04.031
Three, two, one, fire in the hole!

01:03:22.716 --> 01:03:24.093
Anybody home?

01:03:28.263 --> 01:03:31.058
Don't shoot. I'm not armed.

01:03:37.106 --> 01:03:38.399
Stay sharp, men.

01:03:41.026 --> 01:03:45.280
- Where are your friends, Mr. Michaels?
- The escape hatch.

01:03:48.784 --> 01:03:50.452
Escape hatch?

01:03:50.536 --> 01:03:51.620
Up there.

01:03:57.960 --> 01:03:59.294
Put the weapons down.

01:03:59.378 --> 01:04:00.713
Slowly.

01:04:00.796 --> 01:04:02.339
Gotcha.

01:04:05.384 --> 01:04:07.720
[Garner] Weapons down, soldiers!

01:04:16.478 --> 01:04:17.813
Hey, whoa! Don't do it!

01:04:19.023 --> 01:04:20.816
- [Grunting]
- [Garner] Let him go!

01:04:20.899 --> 01:04:22.317
[Dobbs] Sorry, garner.

01:04:22.401 --> 01:04:23.861
[Groans]

01:04:31.785 --> 01:04:33.370
[Chuckles] Gotcha.

01:04:39.251 --> 01:04:42.046
Goddamnit. I hope it's worth it.

01:04:42.129 --> 01:04:44.590
Save the morality speech.

01:04:47.926 --> 01:04:52.097
Oh, so much racket.

01:04:52.431 --> 01:04:55.267
Oh... [chuckles]

01:04:56.310 --> 01:04:57.728
Robert.

01:04:58.479 --> 01:05:01.106
Hello, Robert.
So good to see you.

01:05:06.028 --> 01:05:07.154
Is this your son?

01:05:08.572 --> 01:05:10.157
Looks just like you.

01:05:12.451 --> 01:05:13.869
A little bit more, uh...

01:05:14.203 --> 01:05:15.287
You know, on top, but...

01:05:16.747 --> 01:05:20.042
Now, vlad, is this how
we treat our guests?

01:05:21.376 --> 01:05:22.419
Let him go.

01:05:24.922 --> 01:05:26.006
[Grunts]

01:05:32.596 --> 01:05:33.847
[Groans]

01:05:40.604 --> 01:05:42.731
What happened to his face?

01:05:43.023 --> 01:05:44.233
[Kate] He tried to help you.

01:05:45.275 --> 01:05:49.154
I'm sorry about the nasty look, Robert.

01:05:49.238 --> 01:05:51.740
But, listen, don't worry,
I made a deal with these gentlemen

01:05:51.824 --> 01:05:53.992
that everybody walks out of here.

01:05:54.076 --> 01:05:59.081
Garner's not walking anywhere,
thanks to you.

01:06:03.293 --> 01:06:04.962
Stay the hell away from him.

01:06:12.219 --> 01:06:14.012
Hm. Hm. Hm. Hm. Hm.

01:06:15.764 --> 01:06:17.307
Stay the fuck away!

01:06:17.391 --> 01:06:19.810
Rise and shine, Paul.

01:06:20.894 --> 01:06:23.522
Been one hell of a day, huh?

01:06:23.605 --> 01:06:26.525
I mean, you must feel like
a fish out of water.

01:06:28.193 --> 01:06:32.239
Not a trendy Sushi joint
or a soy milk latte around.

01:06:32.322 --> 01:06:34.241
Stop! Just stop!

01:06:34.324 --> 01:06:35.826
It has nothing to do with him.

01:06:35.909 --> 01:06:38.287
Oh, but it does, Robert.

01:06:39.371 --> 01:06:45.460
The moment you betrayed me,
the moment you stole 600 million,

01:06:45.544 --> 01:06:50.799
you put Paul here right...
Smack dab in the middle.

01:06:54.928 --> 01:06:56.263
What?

01:06:56.346 --> 01:06:58.473
I keep getting knocked off.

01:06:58.557 --> 01:06:59.600
Something's wrong.

01:06:59.683 --> 01:07:03.645
The connection's unstable,
triggers a security kick.

01:07:04.479 --> 01:07:07.065
The system thinks you're a shitty hacker.

01:07:07.149 --> 01:07:09.109
And I have a feeling
that's exactly what you are.

01:07:10.903 --> 01:07:13.530
[Laughing]

01:07:17.159 --> 01:07:19.411
You are a chip off the old block, huh?

01:07:19.494 --> 01:07:23.415
Mm... so, how do we fix it?

01:07:24.458 --> 01:07:27.294
You don't try to use a satellite uplink
in native dead space.

01:07:28.420 --> 01:07:31.632
Even with that much power
linked to its own orbiting designator.

01:07:31.715 --> 01:07:33.435
You'll never get
a strong enough connection.

01:07:34.509 --> 01:07:37.471
Hm. What's the solution?

01:07:39.097 --> 01:07:40.390
A wave rider.

01:07:41.141 --> 01:07:43.435
A what? This guy's full of shit.

01:07:47.731 --> 01:07:48.732
Ulysses.

01:07:49.650 --> 01:07:50.651
Please.

01:07:51.526 --> 01:07:52.527
[Grunts]

01:07:53.195 --> 01:07:54.279
[Paul] Leave her alone!

01:07:54.363 --> 01:07:56.007
- [Balzary] You have ten seconds...
- Please!

01:07:56.031 --> 01:07:57.074
To start making sense

01:07:57.157 --> 01:07:59.159
- you don't have to do that.
- Nine, eight...

01:07:59.243 --> 01:08:01.203
Just cut me loose
and let me use my own machine.

01:08:02.037 --> 01:08:03.580
Please.

01:08:04.915 --> 01:08:06.833
- Two...
- It's right here in my bag.

01:08:07.876 --> 01:08:08.919
[Balzary] Ah...

01:08:09.586 --> 01:08:10.587
I had him.

01:08:11.213 --> 01:08:14.299
Vlad, ulysses, please watch these two.

01:08:15.300 --> 01:08:17.051
Sophia... you're up.

01:08:17.135 --> 01:08:20.221
Let's escort this gentlemen
into the other room.

01:08:20.305 --> 01:08:22.015
Show us, Paul.

01:08:26.060 --> 01:08:27.062
[Grunts]

01:08:27.145 --> 01:08:29.231
You two assholes stay right where you are.

01:08:38.073 --> 01:08:40.117
[Balzary] Please, feel free
to take a seat.

01:08:46.790 --> 01:08:47.791
Now...

01:08:50.335 --> 01:08:52.879
Please, explain this to me.

01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:57.009
Well, like I said,
it's called a wave rider.

01:08:57.091 --> 01:08:58.426
A prototype I designed.

01:08:58.926 --> 01:09:02.555
Instead of going up
to connect to a satellite,

01:09:02.639 --> 01:09:07.352
it spreads out to create
its own individualized signal

01:09:07.435 --> 01:09:10.354
- from a circuit of regional cell towers.
- No way.

01:09:11.314 --> 01:09:12.482
Not out here.

01:09:18.863 --> 01:09:21.742
This is an offline
closed storage digital wallet.

01:09:23.118 --> 01:09:25.620
This isn't a standard
cash account, it's crypto.

01:09:27.747 --> 01:09:29.374
My dad created this wallet?

01:09:31.251 --> 01:09:32.461
Wow.

01:09:34.504 --> 01:09:39.384
From what I know, we just need the code
from your dear old dad.

01:09:40.385 --> 01:09:41.470
And we're good to go.

01:09:41.553 --> 01:09:43.138
Well, it's not that easy.

01:09:48.685 --> 01:09:50.312
Careful now.

01:09:50.770 --> 01:09:52.314
Just tread lightly.

01:09:52.606 --> 01:09:53.689
You see this?

01:09:55.859 --> 01:09:57.235
Damascus steel.

01:09:58.028 --> 01:10:00.739
It's really... it's quite beautiful,
don't you think?

01:10:00.822 --> 01:10:02.491
I do.

01:10:02.574 --> 01:10:06.453
You know if I were to, uh,
slit your throat

01:10:07.913 --> 01:10:11.124
you would actually see the blood
spill from yourjugular

01:10:11.208 --> 01:10:13.418
before you even felt anything.

01:10:13.502 --> 01:10:14.961
Okay, oh...

01:10:15.045 --> 01:10:17.005
Can I just say something, please?

01:10:18.382 --> 01:10:20.008
Don't allow me to interrupt.

01:10:23.011 --> 01:10:25.597
You actually need a passkey
to access digital assets.

01:10:26.515 --> 01:10:29.643
But exchanging crypto
for standard fiat cash,

01:10:29.726 --> 01:10:32.396
it's not as easy as a wire transfer.

01:10:32.479 --> 01:10:35.649
It needs to be hosted on
a cryptocurrency exchange.

01:10:35.732 --> 01:10:37.651
And the assets sold to buyers.

01:10:37.943 --> 01:10:39.986
But that takes an in-depth
registration process

01:10:40.070 --> 01:10:42.656
and oversight by the exchange's
central authority.

01:10:44.658 --> 01:10:47.536
[Stutters]
It can take months to find buyers.

01:10:47.619 --> 01:10:50.122
Let alone an exchange
that is willing and able

01:10:50.205 --> 01:10:51.706
to handle this type of volume.

01:10:54.251 --> 01:11:00.590
Well, I guess it's fortunate that
I just happen to be a chief investor

01:11:00.674 --> 01:11:02.926
in a cutting edge crypto exchange.

01:11:04.636 --> 01:11:07.264
Oh, really? Which one?

01:11:07.347 --> 01:11:09.724
It's called invespia.

01:11:11.893 --> 01:11:13.979
- That's my company.
- Hm.

01:11:14.646 --> 01:11:16.022
What the hell you talking about?

01:11:16.898 --> 01:11:20.694
Winco corporations.
Bluepoint global.

01:11:21.570 --> 01:11:24.406
Kilney partners llc.

01:11:25.073 --> 01:11:26.658
Any of these sound familiar?

01:11:26.741 --> 01:11:32.122
Just a couple of my money market funds
that happen to dabble in crypto.

01:11:32.205 --> 01:11:33.248
That's impossible.

01:11:33.331 --> 01:11:35.333
I've met with all of those fund managers.

01:11:36.668 --> 01:11:39.004
Well, yes.

01:11:39.087 --> 01:11:42.132
These are legitimate investment funds.

01:11:42.215 --> 01:11:44.509
They just happen to be under my control.

01:11:47.179 --> 01:11:49.306
But don't worry,
I know what you're thinking.

01:11:52.225 --> 01:11:56.062
I intend to continue
my support of invespia.

01:11:56.771 --> 01:12:00.317
You see, you are
extremely good at what you do.

01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:02.194
Albeit I don't understand much of it.

01:12:03.987 --> 01:12:05.238
But what I do know...

01:12:07.032 --> 01:12:10.327
Is everything is set up.

01:12:11.203 --> 01:12:16.291
You activate the 600 million
in digital assets

01:12:16.374 --> 01:12:18.335
on the invespia exchange.

01:12:18.418 --> 01:12:23.215
I already have buyers
waiting to complete the transactions,

01:12:23.298 --> 01:12:26.510
and then you authorize the cash transfer

01:12:26.593 --> 01:12:29.804
from invespia to an offshore account.

01:12:29.888 --> 01:12:30.889
[Scoffs]

01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:35.101
So you waited...

01:12:35.185 --> 01:12:38.063
You waited to pull support
from invespia at the right time,

01:12:39.189 --> 01:12:43.068
knowing that I would have no choice
but to contact my father for a loan.

01:12:45.070 --> 01:12:46.196
Pauly...

01:12:46.488 --> 01:12:49.824
Think about the future.

01:12:51.201 --> 01:12:53.662
Think about the transaction fees

01:12:53.745 --> 01:12:58.667
invespia will instantly collect
in a matter... of seconds.

01:12:59.668 --> 01:13:02.879
Your company... your company

01:13:02.963 --> 01:13:05.799
will immediately be cash positive

01:13:05.882 --> 01:13:08.677
and ready for the next evolution.

01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:10.428
I can see it now.

01:13:10.512 --> 01:13:12.347
You and I will be partners,

01:13:12.430 --> 01:13:13.848
and the best part...

01:13:18.103 --> 01:13:22.649
You will walk out of here
in one piece.

01:13:27.571 --> 01:13:30.407
Now, enough wasting time.

01:13:30.490 --> 01:13:34.286
I need you to convince your father
to give you the passkey.

01:13:38.248 --> 01:13:39.541
You already did.

01:13:40.542 --> 01:13:42.085
I'm gonna give you a code.

01:13:42.168 --> 01:13:44.879
I need you to remember it.
Exactly.

01:13:44.963 --> 01:13:47.048
It may save your life.

01:13:51.595 --> 01:13:53.513
Did he now?

01:13:53.597 --> 01:13:54.723
Then what are we doing?

01:13:54.806 --> 01:13:56.266
What are we waiting for?

01:14:08.862 --> 01:14:11.114

01:14:31.551 --> 01:14:32.552
Okay.

01:14:33.136 --> 01:14:36.014
The buyer transactions
have all been finalized.

01:14:37.432 --> 01:14:43.229
Now authorize the cash transfer
to the offshore account and we're done.

01:14:44.397 --> 01:14:47.442
I can't. Not for 15 minutes.

01:14:47.525 --> 01:14:49.778
[Tsking]

01:14:49.861 --> 01:14:51.905
Don't start a new game

01:14:51.988 --> 01:14:54.699
when you're already winning
the first one, Paul.

01:14:54.783 --> 01:14:58.078
Invespia's bound to a 15-minute
buyer ride over session

01:14:58.161 --> 01:15:00.872
for all asset purchases
before funds can be reallocated.

01:15:02.666 --> 01:15:04.334
Bullshit.

01:15:05.335 --> 01:15:08.672
Find a workaround or I will.

01:15:08.755 --> 01:15:11.132
It's embedded in the software.

01:15:11.216 --> 01:15:12.717
Mandatory for compliance.

01:15:18.598 --> 01:15:19.849
In the meantime...

01:15:21.226 --> 01:15:23.228
Kate and my father and I...

01:15:24.938 --> 01:15:26.189
Will be leaving.

01:15:26.272 --> 01:15:28.566
Uh... how's that?

01:15:30.026 --> 01:15:31.486
We're walking out of here.

01:15:35.156 --> 01:15:37.492
When we're safe and sound
I'll authorize the transfer.

01:15:39.786 --> 01:15:43.957
Othennise, the money will be locked away,
again, but without a key.

01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:46.000
[Balzary laughing]

01:16:06.604 --> 01:16:09.149
I'll kill him if you don't
authorize the transaction.

01:16:09.232 --> 01:16:10.692
You're gonna kill us all anyway.

01:16:11.693 --> 01:16:13.528
Not if you cooperate.

01:16:13.611 --> 01:16:16.030
- I am a man of my word.
- So am I.

01:16:18.867 --> 01:16:20.368
I know your goons can track me down

01:16:20.452 --> 01:16:23.079
anytime they want
if I don't follow through.

01:16:23.163 --> 01:16:25.915
I'm committed to make invespia's success
by any means necessary.

01:16:25.999 --> 01:16:28.585
This guarantees the company
has a bright future.

01:16:28.668 --> 01:16:29.668
It's a win-win.

01:16:29.711 --> 01:16:31.421
Why would I throw that a way?

01:16:33.006 --> 01:16:35.717
You remind me of me, Paul.

01:16:37.594 --> 01:16:42.265
But Robert Carter Michaels,
he stays with me.

01:16:43.016 --> 01:16:44.350
He pays his debt.

01:16:45.518 --> 01:16:47.645
Non-negotiable.

01:16:47.729 --> 01:16:52.275
Ulysses, please escort Paul
and our young lady-friend here

01:16:52.358 --> 01:16:53.818
to the perimeter of the facility.

01:16:53.902 --> 01:16:56.905
Once there, he'll give you
an authorization code.

01:16:56.988 --> 01:16:57.989
Radio it to me.

01:16:58.072 --> 01:17:00.575
And then I'll give you the go-ahead
of when to let them go.

01:17:02.452 --> 01:17:04.662
You see? I am a man of my word.

01:17:08.333 --> 01:17:10.043
I'm not leaving without my father.

01:17:11.336 --> 01:17:12.629
Paul, just go.

01:17:23.890 --> 01:17:25.683
I love you, dad.

01:17:25.767 --> 01:17:27.310
I love you too, son.

01:17:29.938 --> 01:17:31.064
Now, go.

01:23:40.141 --> 01:23:41.976
[Groans]

01:23:45.062 --> 01:23:49.066
Now, what were you
and Robert chatting about?

01:23:49.150 --> 01:23:52.278
Just, uh, reminiscing about old times.

01:23:52.361 --> 01:23:54.363
Mm, reminiscing, huh?

01:23:54.447 --> 01:23:58.409
Well, as they say, life can
only be understood backwards,

01:23:58.492 --> 01:24:01.871
but it must be lived fonivard.

01:24:02.955 --> 01:24:05.583
Speaking of which,
the explosives are ready.

01:24:08.669 --> 01:24:10.880
Ulysses, what's the status?

01:24:12.340 --> 01:24:15.801
Does no one answer
these fucking walkies but me?

01:24:15.885 --> 01:24:17.553
Ulysses, do you copy?

01:24:17.637 --> 01:24:19.096
Frederick, a word please.

01:24:20.765 --> 01:24:21.807
Go find them.

01:24:21.891 --> 01:24:23.601
No one leaves this mountain.

01:24:23.684 --> 01:24:25.895
Copy that.

01:24:25.978 --> 01:24:27.772
Why are you releasing your rottweilers?

01:24:27.855 --> 01:24:30.691
I mean, we had a deal,
Kate and Paul walk.

01:24:30.775 --> 01:24:34.654
Well, I guess we both made a few
independent decisions now, haven't we?

01:24:34.737 --> 01:24:35.947
What are you talking about?

01:24:36.030 --> 01:24:39.367
You truly underestimated my relationships
in Europe, now didn't you?

01:24:39.450 --> 01:24:43.663
And you forgot one very important thing.

01:24:43.746 --> 01:24:44.830
What's that?

01:24:44.914 --> 01:24:48.084
Nobody trusts Americans.

01:24:48.167 --> 01:24:50.544
- [Gasps]
- [Grunts]

01:24:51.671 --> 01:24:52.713
Oh, yeah.

01:24:52.797 --> 01:24:54.632
- [Inhales]
- [Whimpers]

01:24:58.010 --> 01:24:59.845
It's kinda sexy, isn't it?

01:25:00.137 --> 01:25:04.517
In like a
"holy shit, I'm dying," kinda way.

01:25:10.648 --> 01:25:11.983
Shit.

01:25:17.613 --> 01:25:19.407
Drag her body out of here.

01:25:20.783 --> 01:25:21.909
You have a towel?

01:25:25.162 --> 01:25:28.082
She really was getting under my skin.

01:25:28.165 --> 01:25:30.793
Alright, close to time.

01:25:30.876 --> 01:25:33.076
Keep an eye on the charges,
keep an eye on the computer.

01:25:33.129 --> 01:25:34.630
Roger that, boss.

01:25:37.967 --> 01:25:39.677
I shoulda killed you.

01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:44.056
Yeah, shoulda, woulda, coulda, didn't.

01:25:46.350 --> 01:25:48.144
Well, if it's any comfort,

01:25:48.227 --> 01:25:50.980
you'll be joining your boy, Paul,
in the afterlife.

01:25:51.981 --> 01:25:53.566
Sooner rather than later.

01:25:54.066 --> 01:25:55.943
Whole family together.

01:25:56.944 --> 01:25:59.655
Sounds like a happy ending to me. Yes?

01:26:02.325 --> 01:26:03.409
Any last words?

01:26:06.162 --> 01:26:08.122
Actually, yes.

01:26:13.836 --> 01:26:16.964
[Uaughs]
I can't believe you're this stupid.

01:26:18.174 --> 01:26:20.384
Mm, how's that?

01:26:20.468 --> 01:26:22.386
All transactions are final.

01:26:22.470 --> 01:26:23.804
Your money's gone.

01:26:31.187 --> 01:26:34.732
For your sake, and your son's sake,
I hope you're wrong.

01:26:34.815 --> 01:26:36.484
[Chuckles]

01:26:42.823 --> 01:26:43.866
[Balzary groans]

01:26:43.949 --> 01:26:45.109
[Blain] Close your eyes, sir!

01:26:46.535 --> 01:26:47.620
[Ringing]

01:26:51.123 --> 01:26:52.541
[Tense music playing]

01:26:56.003 --> 01:26:57.922
[Blain] Sir, your gun, catch.

01:26:58.005 --> 01:26:59.298
[Rapid gunfire]

01:27:00.341 --> 01:27:01.717
[Grunts]

01:27:01.801 --> 01:27:04.220
Blow the explosives,
let's get the fuck out of here.

01:27:07.932 --> 01:27:09.058
My man!

01:27:09.141 --> 01:27:11.102
Boy, you really cracked
the shit out of him, sir.

01:27:12.770 --> 01:27:16.065
Ha! Nothing like a good old-fashioned
headbutt to end the day.

01:27:17.066 --> 01:27:18.526
Thanks for coming back.

01:27:20.569 --> 01:27:22.238
Ah, shit, you kidding?

01:27:22.321 --> 01:27:23.715
I wouldn't miss this shit for the world.

01:27:23.739 --> 01:27:26.450
I haven't had this much fun
since my honeymoon, sir.

01:27:26.534 --> 01:27:28.202
[Robert] I didn't know you were married.

01:27:28.869 --> 01:27:29.995
[Blain] Oh, yeah.

01:27:30.079 --> 01:27:32.373
Only lasted a week though.

01:27:32.456 --> 01:27:34.083
But goddamn, what a week.

01:27:35.084 --> 01:27:37.128
- How you doing?
- Good, you know.

01:27:37.211 --> 01:27:39.171
Just give me a minute.

01:27:39.255 --> 01:27:41.882
I'm gonna go for burgers after.
You like burgers?

01:27:41.966 --> 01:27:42.967
Now?

01:27:43.050 --> 01:27:44.677
See you in hell, asshole!

01:27:55.521 --> 01:27:57.273
[Robert] I need to help my son!

01:28:01.485 --> 01:28:03.654
I'll lay down some covering fire for you.

01:28:07.783 --> 01:28:09.076
[Robert] Beer's on me.

01:28:12.246 --> 01:28:13.622
Hell, yeah it is.

01:28:14.206 --> 01:28:15.708
You hear that, assholes?

01:28:15.791 --> 01:28:18.252
It's Miller time, motherfuckers!

01:28:27.386 --> 01:28:28.679
[Grunts]

01:28:31.932 --> 01:28:33.893
Ulysses, tell me you still have Paul.

01:28:37.271 --> 01:28:38.522
Ulysses?

01:28:41.108 --> 01:28:42.902
- Ulysses!
- [Voice echoes on walkie]

01:29:03.506 --> 01:29:05.841
[Laughs]

01:29:07.134 --> 01:29:08.344
Shit.

01:29:16.143 --> 01:29:17.394
[Groans]

01:29:33.661 --> 01:29:35.538
[Laughing]

01:29:35.621 --> 01:29:36.914
[Sniffs]

01:29:37.039 --> 01:29:38.332
[Groans]

01:29:51.804 --> 01:29:52.805
[Laughs]

01:30:00.271 --> 01:30:06.360
They say life
could be understood... backwards.

01:30:07.361 --> 01:30:12.449
But it must be lived fonivard.

01:30:13.450 --> 01:30:14.618
That's right.

01:30:16.870 --> 01:30:18.497
Do me a favor...

01:30:20.499 --> 01:30:22.418
Try and save my wife.

01:30:30.050 --> 01:30:32.720
She suffered enough for my sins.

01:30:37.433 --> 01:30:39.518
Please, Robert.

01:30:39.602 --> 01:30:40.853
Done.

01:31:09.048 --> 01:31:10.466
Here. Here it is.

01:31:15.220 --> 01:31:17.407
We just have to get supplies,
then we'll get to the extraction point.

01:31:17.431 --> 01:31:18.974
I'm not leaving here
without my father.

01:31:19.058 --> 01:31:20.100
Neither am I.

01:31:20.184 --> 01:31:22.519
I'm not leaving here without both of you.

01:31:29.860 --> 01:31:30.903
Get on your knees.

01:31:33.947 --> 01:31:35.532
Now, asshole.

01:31:36.909 --> 01:31:39.244
Now Simon says put your hands on your head.

01:31:40.162 --> 01:31:42.790
- Okay, good.
- Just-just give it up.

01:31:42.873 --> 01:31:44.166
All-all your buddies are dead.

01:31:44.249 --> 01:31:46.168
[Yells]

01:31:46.251 --> 01:31:47.920
[Grunting]

01:31:58.222 --> 01:31:59.598
You two okay?

01:32:02.893 --> 01:32:04.478
Car's outside.

01:32:27.084 --> 01:32:29.712
Hey. Hey, come back!

01:32:32.256 --> 01:32:34.758
Oh, come on, that's my ride!

01:32:34.842 --> 01:32:37.177
Great, sure, don't wait for me!

01:32:37.261 --> 01:32:40.389
[Sighs] Easy to forget about the guy
who's been saving everybody's ass.

01:32:40.472 --> 01:32:41.724
Literally, all day.

01:32:43.392 --> 01:32:45.269
No problem, uh...

01:32:45.352 --> 01:32:48.814
I'm just gonna hang tight here,
wait for the cops to come.

01:32:50.691 --> 01:32:54.737
Sitting with my... uh, new friend.

01:32:54.820 --> 01:32:56.447
[Sighs]

01:32:56.530 --> 01:33:00.242
Just tell them to be on the lookout
for all the dead mercenaries.

01:33:00.325 --> 01:33:02.077
That I helped take out.

01:33:03.162 --> 01:33:04.329
Most of them.

01:33:04.413 --> 01:33:05.748
[Laughs]

01:33:25.267 --> 01:33:26.560
