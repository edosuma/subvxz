Previously on Nikita:

00:03.545 --> 00:05.706
NIKITA: People | used to work for,
they're Division:

00:05.881 --> 00:07.997
A black-ops program
that has now gone rogue.

00:08.175 --> 00:11.463
If I was on the inside,
I could tell you what they were planning.

00:11.637 --> 00:14.299
The black box contains
our government's darkest secrets.

00:14.473 --> 00:15.713
PERCY:
Change is coming, Michael.

00:15.891 --> 00:19.349
That black box is what is going
to make those changes possible.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.852
You're planning a move
against the government?

00:22.022 --> 00:24.855
NIKITA: We find the rest of the black boxes,
we can kill Percy.

00:25.025 --> 00:28.267
Nikita has an escape plan.
I want you to come with me.

00:41.458 --> 00:44.040
ALEX: I did what you said.
I did a surveillance sweep...

00:44.211 --> 00:47.294
...and there is no one
physically watching my apartment.

00:47.464 --> 00:49.671
I can bolt at any time.
I can leave the car.

00:49.841 --> 00:52.799
I think I can leave the clothes.
Everything.

00:52.970 --> 00:55.336
In fact, I don't have
to even go back there now.

00:55.514 --> 00:57.550
I mean, I can set up right here.

00:57.724 --> 01:00.966
Not a good time to blow your cover
and join me on the outside.

01:01.144 --> 01:02.850
Why not? What are you waiting for?

01:03.689 --> 01:05.145
Look, we're doing really well.

01:05.315 --> 01:08.523
Percy's freaking out because
I've killed two of his black boxes.

01:08.694 --> 01:10.901
He called Michael in
to help secure the rest.

01:11.196 --> 01:13.858
We've got him on the ropes,
but we can't make a mistake.

01:14.032 --> 01:16.819
Fine. But you're just making my point.

01:16.994 --> 01:20.236
Michael is a way better double agent
than I could ever be.

01:20.414 --> 01:22.575
You don't need me
on the inside anymore.

01:22.749 --> 01:26.241
You're always telling me
that it's too dangerous for me in there...

01:26.420 --> 01:28.411
...and I thought you wanted me
to get out.

01:28.589 --> 01:32.252
When "out" meant Fiji,
not sticking around to fight Division.

01:32.426 --> 01:36.419
Nikita, I look at you,
and you call your own shots.

01:36.597 --> 01:38.883
You're not running away from anything.

01:39.975 --> 01:43.718
Doesn't mean I can't wait for this
to be over, Alex.

01:43.895 --> 01:45.931
Yeah, and when it's over...

01:46.273 --> 01:48.104
...where do you go after that?

01:50.277 --> 01:52.563
PERCY:
Plainview, Pennsylvania.

01:52.738 --> 01:55.571
Population, 7500.

01:56.033 --> 01:59.241
A slice of small-town Americana.

01:59.411 --> 02:02.278
The kind of place we're in the business
of protecting.

02:02.456 --> 02:06.199
And the last place on earth anyone
would ever think to look for a black box.

02:06.376 --> 02:07.707
Not even Nikita.

02:08.378 --> 02:10.209
Let us be clear about this.

02:10.380 --> 02:13.918
There is only one reason she succeeded
in destroying those two boxes.

02:14.551 --> 02:15.882
Owen Elliot.

02:16.053 --> 02:19.386
Guardians are supposed to be perfect,
and he was far from it.

02:19.556 --> 02:23.299
When a component breaks down,
the entire system needs to be reevaluated.

02:23.477 --> 02:26.093
Then and only then
can the proper adjustments be made.

02:27.314 --> 02:28.929
What kind of adjustments?

02:34.237 --> 02:37.229
This is the Plainview guardian, Winters.

02:37.407 --> 02:39.022
I want you to surveil her.

02:39.660 --> 02:41.867
One 24-hour cycle.

02:42.037 --> 02:44.574
Do not initiate contact.

02:44.748 --> 02:48.411
Just make sure she's following protocol.

02:48.794 --> 02:51.536
Any behavior out of the ordinary,
I wanna hear about it.

02:51.713 --> 02:53.294
I remember Winters.

02:53.465 --> 02:55.296
Michael, this is priority one.

02:55.717 --> 02:59.801
I'm checking on all four guardians
simultaneously, starting now.

03:05.060 --> 03:07.051
BIRKHOFF:
Here's Winters' tracker ID.

03:07.229 --> 03:10.187
Word of advice:
Don't let her catch you spying on her.

03:10.357 --> 03:14.270
These guardians are tightly wound freaks.
Just like their boss.

03:14.945 --> 03:16.606
Percy's giving you trouble, huh?

03:16.780 --> 03:20.944
God, the man is freaking out.
He needs to chill.

03:21.118 --> 03:24.485
I've been on 24/7 black box duty
all month.

03:26.248 --> 03:28.705
I guess Nikita's got him pretty rattled.

03:28.875 --> 03:30.740
Heh. Yeah.

03:31.336 --> 03:32.917

I'm not an idiot, okay?

What am I...?
This isn't about Nikita, and you know it.

03:49.896 --> 03:52.103
It's about Operation Sparrow.

03:53.150 --> 03:54.856
What's Operation Sparrow?

03:55.026 --> 03:58.063
Heh. Didn't I just ask you not to do that?

03:58.238 --> 04:01.605
I'm gonna find out in a couple weeks
when the operation goes active...

04:01.783 --> 04:05.696
-...so you may as well tell me now.
-Couple of weeks?

04:08.832 --> 04:10.493

-Nothing.

04:16.339 --> 04:18.079
You're right about one thing.

04:18.258 --> 04:21.466
Whatever Operation Sparrow is,
I will be briefed before you.

04:21.636 --> 04:24.719
If you want advance word,
then you'd better give me yours now.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.176

04:27.350 --> 04:29.306
Operation Sparrow. That's it.

04:29.519 --> 04:31.726

on the boxes.

04:31.897 --> 04:37.358
-Don't you send the updates?
-| encrypt them while he watches me.

04:37.694 --> 04:42.734
Look, all I know is it's going down soon
and it's big.

04:43.950 --> 04:45.281
Whatever it is.

04:48.747 --> 04:51.284
Remember the big changes
Percy was telling me about?

04:51.458 --> 04:53.164
The move against the government?

04:53.335 --> 04:56.748
I think that's what Operation Sparrow
is code name for.

04:57.047 --> 05:01.040
You want me to hunt down the guardian,
get the box, but not destroy it.

05:01.218 --> 05:02.833
MICHAEL:
And you better get going.

05:03.053 --> 05:06.420
-We have about a six-hour window.
-I thought that-- Wait, I--

05:06.598 --> 05:09.180
Wait, whoa.
I thought Percy gave you 24 hours.

05:09.351 --> 05:11.967
We have 24 hours to spy on Winters
and report back.

05:12.145 --> 05:15.308
If my report is that you showed up,
kicked the guardian's ass...

05:15.482 --> 05:18.019
...took the box,
and I failed to stop you, then....

05:18.193 --> 05:19.273
It'd look suspicious.

05:19.444 --> 05:21.435
You need to get it done before I show up.

05:21.613 --> 05:24.901
That way, I can tell Percy,
"Sorry, you sent me in too late."

05:25.075 --> 05:26.736
I don't like it.

05:26.952 --> 05:28.362
MICHAEL:
You've dealt with worse.

05:28.578 --> 05:32.662
No, I mean, I think that we should
destroy the box, not peek inside it.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.994
Cracking the box is the only way
to get ahead of Percy.

05:35.168 --> 05:39.161
If I have to wait for him to brief me
on Sparrow, then I think it'll be too late.

33:26.296 --> 33:29.208
-You ready?
-Yeah.

33:49.778 --> 33:52.941
MICHAEL:
Hold your fire. I said, hold your fire!

33:53.114 --> 33:55.150
There's no way out. We got her pinned.

34:12.217 --> 34:14.549
Everything's gonna be okay, I promise.

34:14.719 --> 34:16.584
You said you didn't make any promises.

34:16.763 --> 34:19.630
Well, this one I intend to keep,
all right, punk?

34:24.312 --> 34:28.055
I'll give you the black box
if you let the kid go. He's innocent.

34:28.733 --> 34:31.816
That's fine. Let him go.
Then we'll deal with the box.

34:31.987 --> 34:34.649
-It's a trap.
-We don't need to add a dead civilian.

34:34.823 --> 34:36.063
Even Nikita knows that.

34:36.491 --> 34:39.278
Be careful, okay?

34:57.053 --> 34:58.304
Nikita!

34:58.722 --> 34:59.882
Come out now!

35:00.890 --> 35:03.427
MICHAEL: What are you doing?
-She's not gonna sacrifice him.

35:03.602 --> 35:05.843
He's our ticket to the black box
and Nikita.

35:08.940 --> 35:11.932
Nikita, you're gonna come out
with the black box...

35:12.110 --> 35:13.941
...and let us restrain you.

35:14.112 --> 35:16.899
Or I blow this kid's brains
all over the street.

35:17.616 --> 35:19.527
I'm counting to three.

35:20.368 --> 35:21.949
One!

35:22.704 --> 35:24.319
Two!

36:07.582 --> 36:08.992
Who else was here?

36:09.459 --> 36:11.370
It was just Jaden and me.

36:12.462 --> 36:15.078
Which of you wears aftershave?

36:15.423 --> 36:19.587
I was lighting a candle
to calm myself down.

36:19.761 --> 36:21.376
Something Amanda taught me.

36:21.680 --> 36:23.511
ROAN: Was Jaden drinking?
-What?

36:23.682 --> 36:27.595
Did she consume any alcohol in
the last four hours to your knowledge?

36:27.769 --> 36:30.806
I don't-- No, I don't think so.

36:32.190 --> 36:34.647
The muscle relaxant
makes them easy to maneuver...

36:34.818 --> 36:38.106
...but it also flushes out
any internal toxins through the pores.

36:38.613 --> 36:40.945
I don't like the smell of alcohol.

36:52.836 --> 36:56.954
You'll need to report in.
Amanda wants a full debrief.

37:03.680 --> 37:06.717
DANA:
This blood sample will give you access.

37:09.477 --> 37:10.683
Thank you.

37:13.022 --> 37:15.013
You know, before you came,
I was trapped.

37:15.191 --> 37:19.776
Stuck between two worlds
and afraid to walk away from either one.

37:20.780 --> 37:22.862
Now you're in the world
where you belong.

37:23.032 --> 37:26.240
What about you? Think you'll end up
in the world where you belong?

37:27.954 --> 37:29.569
CHARUE:
Dana.

37:33.209 --> 37:34.995
Thank you.

37:38.047 --> 37:39.753
Just”

37:40.508 --> 37:43.796
...when you're out there fighting...

37:45.138 --> 37:48.881
-...you be careful, okay?
-Okay.

38:10.288 --> 38:12.700
I hope we can crack this thing.

38:12.874 --> 38:15.035
Othen/vise,
we have to look for new leads.

38:15.210 --> 38:16.700
I'm sorry.

38:19.380 --> 38:20.756
For what?

38:25.386 --> 38:29.220
I can make plans
for the worst-case scenario, no problem.

38:30.308 --> 38:34.551
But when it comes to planning ahead
for positive outcomes...

38:34.729 --> 38:36.560
...I'm just not used to that.

38:37.148 --> 38:40.015
It does not mean I don't want one.

38:41.277 --> 38:42.653
Itsjust”.

38:43.655 --> 38:45.896
It has been a long time...

38:46.074 --> 38:49.612
...since anything as good as you
has happened to my life.

39:10.765 --> 39:12.426
MICHAEL:
Have you heard from Alex?

39:12.600 --> 39:14.181
Not yet.

39:18.439 --> 39:19.940
Your story seems to match up...

39:20.108 --> 39:23.441
...with the geography
of Jaden's tracker this evening.

39:23.611 --> 39:28.105
But I have to say, Alex,
I'm somewhat shocked by all this.

39:28.283 --> 39:30.774
I thought you and Jaden
were becoming friends.

39:32.829 --> 39:35.445
Jaden never wanted to be my friend.

39:37.458 --> 39:39.790
But after what happened in Switzerland,
surely--

39:39.961 --> 39:41.701
She thought I made her look bad.

39:41.880 --> 39:43.461
That she couldn't save herself.

39:44.632 --> 39:48.671
She's always had it in for me.
She was just biding her time.

39:49.137 --> 39:52.129
It makes sense that someone
with her psychological makeup...

39:52.307 --> 39:54.468
...would resent you for your help.

39:54.642 --> 39:57.224
You must have wounded her pride
more than I imagined.

39:57.645 --> 39:58.896
Are we finished?

40:00.356 --> 40:01.687
Yes.

40:04.611 --> 40:06.476
Alex, one more thing.

40:08.031 --> 40:11.239
Are you familiar
with our new cochlear implants?

40:12.035 --> 40:15.152
Division's been developing them
for some time.

40:15.330 --> 40:18.163
They go in a subject's ear.
They're virtually undetectable.

40:18.333 --> 40:20.995
Even to the person they're planted on.

40:21.169 --> 40:24.002
ALEX [ON RECORDING]:
Nikita, thank God. I need your help.

40:24.380 --> 40:26.416
Jaden, she, um....

40:27.050 --> 40:28.881
She came over,
and we got in an argument.

40:29.052 --> 40:33.341
It happened so fast.
And she tried to kill me.

40:38.227 --> 40:42.391
How much longer did you think
you could hide who you really are...

40:46.694 --> 40:47.854
...Alexandra?
