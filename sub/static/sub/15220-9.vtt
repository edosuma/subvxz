00:28.665 --> 00:32.418
Dr Sam Beckett stepped
into the Quantum Leap accelerator...

00:32.418 --> 00:34.838
and vanished.

00:38.550 --> 00:41.344
He woke to find himself
trapped in the past,

00:41.344 --> 00:44.806
facing mirror images
that were not his own.

00:44.806 --> 00:49.019
And driven by an unknown force
to change history for the better.

00:50.145 --> 00:52.355
His only guide on this journey
is Al -

00:52.355 --> 00:57.027
an observer from his own time, who
appears in the form of a hologram

00:57.027 --> 00:59.321
that only Sam can see and hear.

00:59.321 --> 01:03.491
And so Dr Beckett finds himself
leaping from life to life,

01:03.491 --> 01:06.620
striving to put right
what once went wrong.

01:06.620 --> 01:09.289
And hoping each time
that his next leap...

01:10.499 --> 01:12.584
..will be the leap home.'

01:21.426 --> 01:23.220
Look, man, watch out!

01:24.971 --> 01:27.974
Hey, get away from me!
What are you doing, dirtball?!

01:27.974 --> 01:29.684
Look out!

01:42.197 --> 01:45.200
Ooooooooh boy!

03:17.626 --> 03:20.962
Man, that stunt was crazy!

03:20.962 --> 03:23.715
Yeah, well, thanks.

03:23.715 --> 03:26.593
Mad Dog, you should have seen
your face!

03:26.593 --> 03:29.971
Yeah, was it a joke?
You trying to kill me for a joke?

03:31.097 --> 03:34.309
Hey, he crashed, not you!
Isn't he hurt enough already?

03:34.309 --> 03:36.144
It wasn't a joke.

03:36.144 --> 03:38.563
(GROANS) Just lost control.

03:38.563 --> 03:40.524
Oh, like you've never rode a bike
before!

03:41.566 --> 03:43.610
Well, actually...

03:45.153 --> 03:47.739
..no.
(LAUGHTER)

03:47.739 --> 03:50.200
Dillon, stop him!
Something you'll never do again!

03:50.200 --> 03:53.203
Hey, Mad Dog! Cool it!

03:53.203 --> 03:54.871
Cool it!

03:56.748 --> 03:58.625
Mad Dog...

03:59.626 --> 04:03.129
Becky wants him to have a pass.
Oh, now she's the boss?

04:03.129 --> 04:06.925
No, I'm the boss.
You got a problem with that?

04:09.553 --> 04:11.346
Hm?

04:11.346 --> 04:13.390
Hm?!

04:13.390 --> 04:15.350
Get out of my way!

04:15.350 --> 04:17.351
MAN: Woo-hoo!
WOMAN: Go, Becky!

04:19.688 --> 04:21.523
Thanks.

04:22.440 --> 04:24.484
Come on, let's blow.

04:26.695 --> 04:28.655
Hey!

04:28.655 --> 04:31.700
MAN: Oh, good shot, Mad Dog!
(LAUGHTER)

04:33.076 --> 04:36.663
The guy rides with us a week, and
this is the way you welcome him?
Yeah.

04:39.374 --> 04:41.251
Now he's stuck out here?

04:41.251 --> 04:43.211
He's a big boy.

04:43.211 --> 04:46.256
There's a diner about 20 minutes
down the coast.

04:46.256 --> 04:48.300
We'll have some cold brew
waiting for you.

04:48.300 --> 04:50.135
(LAUGHTER AND WHOOPING)

04:50.135 --> 04:52.262
(ENGINES START)

04:52.262 --> 04:54.306
(WHOOPING)

04:59.186 --> 05:02.314
You mess with me again,
you're gonna get jacked.

05:02.314 --> 05:04.024
Jacked?

05:04.983 --> 05:07.110
You dig, dirtball?

05:07.110 --> 05:08.862
I dig.

05:21.791 --> 05:23.418
(GROANS)

05:31.426 --> 05:33.220
Whoa!

05:37.474 --> 05:40.852
'Quantum Leaping around in time,
I've assumed many characters,

05:40.852 --> 05:44.481
but this was my first leap back
as a dirtball.'

05:44.481 --> 05:46.399
AL: Not exactly Brando.

05:48.610 --> 05:51.112
But you kinda look like a wild one.

05:52.447 --> 05:54.366
I'm a biker, Al.

05:54.366 --> 05:56.701
Yeah, and somebody cut
your fuel line. I know.

05:56.701 --> 05:59.996
Turn that petrol guard right there.
Right there, where your hand is.

05:59.996 --> 06:02.290
Good. Look at this.

06:02.290 --> 06:06.545
This is a classic
Harley Sportster 1957,

06:06.545 --> 06:09.381
55 cubic inches, overhead valves.

06:09.381 --> 06:12.175
Sam, you're styling.
Don't tell me you were a biker too?

06:12.175 --> 06:14.886
Er, well my first car was a bike.

06:15.971 --> 06:19.933
I had a '48 Harley Knucklehead.
Named after you?

06:22.352 --> 06:26.439
I'll pretend you didn't say that.
I used to love to ride girls
on the back of that thing.

06:26.439 --> 06:28.275
Now, those were the days -
and nights.

06:28.984 --> 06:31.278
Is there anything you haven't done,
Al?

06:31.278 --> 06:34.531
Well, there's one thing that's
impossible to do on a bike.

06:39.327 --> 06:42.873
Er, don't know. Just heard that
you leapt into a biker,

06:42.873 --> 06:45.500
so I rushed to check out
your wheels.

06:49.713 --> 06:51.798
What's that? Oh, that's nice.

06:51.798 --> 06:55.719
You know, a good caricature can tell
you really a lot about a person.

06:55.719 --> 06:59.347
And I'd say that that person
likes to be free.

06:59.347 --> 07:01.391
Shane's pretty good.
Shane?

07:01.391 --> 07:05.812
Yeah, er... Shane 'Funny Bone'
Thomas, that's your name.

07:05.812 --> 07:08.398
It's September 1st 1958,

07:08.398 --> 07:12.444
and you're somewhere about an hour
south of Big Sur, California.

07:12.444 --> 07:15.071
And according to Ziggy,
you're the new kid on the block.

07:15.071 --> 07:17.616
You joined the Cobras a week ago,

07:17.616 --> 07:20.702
and your MO is gang...

07:22.954 --> 07:26.917
..clown. Gang clown. Gang clown!
That's kinda funny.

07:26.917 --> 07:30.378
Al, I don't know how to ride
this bike. I don't have a clue.

07:30.378 --> 07:33.215
I wrecked it in front of everybody.
There's nothing to it.

07:33.215 --> 07:35.550
Your rear brake is with your foot
over there.

07:35.550 --> 07:39.054
Here's your front brake, throttle.
There's your clutch over there.

07:39.054 --> 07:41.598
There's your gear shift -
one down, three up.

07:41.598 --> 07:44.976
Neutral's between one and two. You
kick start it with this thing here,

07:44.976 --> 07:47.604
only when it's in neutral
and get it washed.

07:49.189 --> 07:52.150
Al, I can't be a biker.
Where's your sense of adventure?

07:52.275 --> 07:54.110
Don't you know what it feels like?

07:54.110 --> 07:57.447
Yeah, like playing slip and slide
on asphalt. Look at my leg -

07:57.447 --> 08:00.450
I'm not talking about that.
I'm talking about the way it feels

08:00.450 --> 08:04.830
when the sun blasts into your skin
if you've got sunscreen on,

08:04.830 --> 08:09.125
and the wind waves by your face
and you sail off into the blue

08:09.125 --> 08:13.880
on your chrome-plated candy coloured
flaming red dream machine.

08:15.382 --> 08:17.509
You never know what's around
the next corner.

08:19.177 --> 08:21.721
Probably a head-on with a semi.

08:21.721 --> 08:23.807

Right now all right?!

08:46.329 --> 08:48.290
We missed you, buddy!

08:49.249 --> 08:51.042
You know what you need right now?

08:51.042 --> 08:53.378
A shower?

08:53.378 --> 08:55.547
Some brew!

08:55.547 --> 08:57.591
(SHOUT OVER EACH OTHER)

08:59.092 --> 09:01.178

09:04.764 --> 09:06.683
(CHEERING)

09:07.392 --> 09:09.019
No, no...

09:10.020 --> 09:12.731
I gotta sit down and slip into
a coma.

09:12.731 --> 09:14.816
(LAUGHTER)

09:16.610 --> 09:18.778
What about more beer, old man?

09:27.787 --> 09:29.789
Let me see.
No.

09:29.789 --> 09:32.751
Come on, let me see. Come on!
Come on, I like your stories.

09:32.751 --> 09:36.338
I liked er...The Petrified Forest,

09:36.338 --> 09:38.548
the one where we met
the Navajo Indians.

09:38.548 --> 09:40.425
Yeah, I liked that one. So come on!

09:40.425 --> 09:42.219
No, I'm not finished yet!

09:42.219 --> 09:44.304
Read it. Come on!

09:44.971 --> 09:46.681
OK.

09:48.058 --> 09:49.851
OK.

09:49.851 --> 09:52.604
'Stirring the pool from
its glassy sleep,

09:52.604 --> 09:54.773
I drank with cupped hands.

09:54.773 --> 09:57.317
The ripples swirled
and slipped away

09:57.317 --> 09:59.194
until at last...

10:00.070 --> 10:02.697
I gazed into the still water
and froze.

10:03.615 --> 10:06.326
Drowning in the shadow of myself.

10:06.326 --> 10:08.453
'Shadow of yourself.'
What does that mean?

10:08.453 --> 10:11.957
It means the reflection.
You know, like in a mirror?

10:11.957 --> 10:13.959
So why didn't you just say that?

10:13.959 --> 10:16.920
Why didn't you just say,
'She saw her own reflection'?

10:16.920 --> 10:19.005
If you don't like my writing, then -

10:19.005 --> 10:21.633
Hey, no, come on, baby. Come on!

10:21.633 --> 10:23.426
I like your writing.

10:23.426 --> 10:26.388
I'm just trying to figure out
what it's all about. That's all.

10:26.388 --> 10:28.223
It's metaphoric.

10:29.349 --> 10:32.394
Oh yeah, what's that, Bone?
Yeah, like he knows!

10:32.394 --> 10:34.479
Well, it...

10:34.479 --> 10:37.440
It means I think that sometimes
the words...

10:37.440 --> 10:39.651
have a meaning beyond
what they're saying.

10:39.651 --> 10:41.444
Right.

10:41.444 --> 10:43.446
It's not just the words.

10:43.446 --> 10:45.532
It's also what's behind the words.

10:45.532 --> 10:47.826
What's behind the words.
Yeah.

10:47.826 --> 10:49.619
Like when we were in Korea.

10:49.619 --> 10:51.663
They told us it was police action.

10:51.663 --> 10:53.832
It was actually war.

10:53.832 --> 10:55.792
We were out there.

10:55.792 --> 10:59.504
We were freezing our asses off
and we were getting shot at.

10:59.504 --> 11:01.339

you were in Korea?

Not because I wanted to be.
Ah. My son's a marine.

11:19.608 --> 11:22.402
Won himself the Navy Cross
fighting over there.

11:22.402 --> 11:25.739
Got yourself a hero.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, man.

11:25.739 --> 11:27.908
Fought the enemy single-handed

11:27.908 --> 11:32.120
when his battalion got surrounded
at the Chosin Reservoir.

11:32.120 --> 11:35.874

Of Honour when he comes home.

Shadow waiting for him.

11:47.552 --> 11:50.680
Man, that's quite a bike.
Uh-huh.

11:52.724 --> 11:55.268
Hey, you mind we come by,
we check it out?

11:55.268 --> 11:58.146
Sorry, man.
It's in storage at his uncle's.

11:59.189 --> 12:02.609
How much you want for it?
Hey, that bike's not for sale.

12:02.609 --> 12:06.530
Anybody still over there is
either dead or a commie turncoat.

12:06.530 --> 12:08.406
His son's not a communist.

12:08.406 --> 12:11.201
Don't matter, old man.
He ain't coming back, he's dead.

12:11.201 --> 12:13.036
No, he's not.
He's dead!

12:13.036 --> 12:14.913
Hey, shut up.

12:15.747 --> 12:17.999
I'm talking about the old man's son,
OK?

12:17.999 --> 12:20.502
My Darrell is not dead.

12:20.502 --> 12:23.213
And he ain't no commie.

Supposed to be Dillon's old lady,
huh?

12:38.270 --> 12:42.232
Dillon, Bone drew a picture
of your old lady.

12:53.827 --> 12:55.579
It's not bad.

13:06.173 --> 13:08.550

I can't.
Why not?

dirt off, make me feel better?

14:20.831 --> 14:23.917
Er, here. Here's a towel.

14:37.639 --> 14:41.726

getting in a shuffle,

14:41.726 --> 14:45.272
with some guy who wanted to jack me,
I'm great (!)

14:45.272 --> 14:48.525
Would you mind telling me what I'm
here to do, so I can get out of here,

14:48.525 --> 14:50.902
because so far, Al, this leap
has not been a whole -

14:50.902 --> 14:53.864
You're here to prevent a murder.

is gonna kill her?

15:07.794 --> 15:12.048
She's found stabbed to death on a
beach about 30 miles north of here.

in the next 24 hours.

16:27.388 --> 16:29.098
Not bad.
Hm.

16:31.642 --> 16:33.519
Hey, where you going, man?

16:35.271 --> 16:37.356
I lost my appetite.

16:38.566 --> 16:40.776
Come on, suddenly Bone
ain't so funny!

16:41.986 --> 16:43.904
If he can get her, he can have her.

16:47.992 --> 16:50.995
BECKY: Oh, I never realised
how beautiful the ocean is.

16:50.995 --> 16:52.830
SAM: You've never seen the ocean?

16:52.830 --> 16:55.249
Well, there isn't much beachfront
in Wichita.

16:57.418 --> 16:59.879
So Dillon came around and...

17:01.589 --> 17:04.342
..saved you from a boring life
in nowhere's-ville, huh?

17:04.342 --> 17:06.051
Something like that.

17:09.472 --> 17:11.265
How about your folks?

17:12.433 --> 17:14.769
Well, my mom took the easy way out.

17:15.978 --> 17:18.105
She died when I was seven.

17:19.773 --> 17:22.777
Your dad?
My dad died too.

17:22.777 --> 17:25.154
He just never sobered up long enough
to realise it.

17:28.741 --> 17:32.370
(SIGHS) Becky...
Hey, hey. I got out.

17:32.370 --> 17:34.622
And riding with Dillon...

17:35.706 --> 17:37.583
Now I'm as free as he is.

17:38.793 --> 17:42.755
I'm not sure that you can call
being with Dillon free.

17:42.755 --> 17:45.091
Jack Kerouac would.

17:45.091 --> 17:47.510
I'm on the road like Kerouac was.

17:48.803 --> 17:51.472
Living life,
seeing what's out there.

17:51.472 --> 17:54.517
I don't think that that means
you have to follow Dillon.

17:54.517 --> 17:56.352
Don't you see?

17:56.352 --> 17:58.646
Dillon's one of the mad ones.

17:58.646 --> 18:00.773
He's living life on the edge.

18:00.773 --> 18:03.859
He's just gonna take you down
with him. How do you know?

18:06.320 --> 18:09.782
Because I've known types like Dillon
before.

18:13.869 --> 18:15.663
Becky...

18:15.663 --> 18:17.623
you gotta get away from him.

18:32.930 --> 18:34.724
Don't go.

18:37.059 --> 18:39.937
Hey.
Shane... Shane...

18:39.937 --> 18:43.107
Well, looks like you two
had a little heart-to-heart.

18:43.107 --> 18:45.317
That's right.
I want her to stay here.

18:45.317 --> 18:47.445
Is that right, cowboy?

18:47.445 --> 18:49.613
(CHUCKLES)

18:49.613 --> 18:52.742
That's right, Martial Dillon!

18:52.742 --> 18:54.869
She's my girl now!

18:56.662 --> 19:00.750
Well, well. Looks like you belong
to cowboy Bone now.
Is that right, Miss Becky?

19:02.460 --> 19:06.130
BECKY: Dillon, stop him!
Stop Mad Dog, why?

19:06.130 --> 19:08.466
Cowboy Bone's trying to steal
my girl.

19:13.763 --> 19:16.515
This isn't funny any more, OK?
Let's go, Dillon.

19:16.515 --> 19:18.225
Drop him, Mad Dog!

19:22.688 --> 19:24.690
You crack me up, man.

19:24.690 --> 19:26.942
You crack me up.

19:33.199 --> 19:35.242
(WHOOPING)

19:36.535 --> 19:40.790
ERNIE: You gotta go after her.
I got some spare few lines
in here somewhere.

19:42.667 --> 19:44.543
There you go.

19:47.463 --> 19:49.423
All righty.

19:55.513 --> 19:57.556
Now, hold on.
I want you to see something.

19:58.349 --> 20:00.393
(CHUCKLES)

20:00.393 --> 20:03.437
(WHISTLES) Vincent Black Shadow,
she's beautiful!

20:03.437 --> 20:06.607
I keep her cleaned and polished
for when Darrell comes home.

20:06.607 --> 20:08.776
You must be real proud of him.

20:08.776 --> 20:12.029
Oh, man. Now let me take care
of you. Thanks a lot.

20:14.031 --> 20:16.033
You ain't like them other boys.

20:16.033 --> 20:18.536
How in the world did you get
hooked up with them?

20:19.745 --> 20:21.497
I just sorta fell into it.

20:22.873 --> 20:24.792
I'll tell you what,
I don't trust 'em.

20:24.792 --> 20:26.669
Well, that's OK
because I don't either.

20:31.048 --> 20:33.092
Strange, ain't it?
Hm?

20:34.093 --> 20:39.432
I mean, how boys like that
come back from Korea and...

20:39.432 --> 20:41.475
my son's still there.

20:41.475 --> 20:45.229
And, look, I don't wish harm
on nobody in this world.

20:47.189 --> 20:49.025
But that just don't seem right.

20:52.319 --> 20:54.280
(SIGHS)

20:55.364 --> 20:57.074
You ever lost anybody?

20:58.576 --> 21:02.371
Yeah. But I got 'em back.

21:05.624 --> 21:08.294
Yeah, I want you to listen to this.

21:15.551 --> 21:17.428
See, er...

21:17.428 --> 21:20.681
See, this is about where an
American boy came back from Korea

21:20.681 --> 21:22.516
that they thought was dead.

21:22.516 --> 21:24.643
Now, there's still some boys
over there too.

21:24.643 --> 21:28.522
Sure, some of them stayed because
they was young and brainwashed.

21:28.522 --> 21:32.360
AL: It's true, Sam.
Some American POWs stayed over there
after the war ended.

21:32.360 --> 21:34.153
What about Darrell?

21:34.153 --> 21:36.822
Ah, no, no, no. Not my Darrell.

21:36.822 --> 21:39.950
He wouldn't do anything like that.
He's smart, the boy's honest.

21:41.285 --> 21:43.663
Besides, until I see him one way
or another...

21:44.664 --> 21:47.875
I gotta believe
he's coming back alive.

21:49.335 --> 21:52.755
Darrell Tyler was listed
missing in action.

21:55.257 --> 21:59.595
His remains are gonna be returned
to the United States in two years.

22:00.680 --> 22:04.225
And Ernie dies a few months
after that.

22:10.898 --> 22:12.983
Maybe I should have told him
the truth, Al.

22:12.983 --> 22:17.697
No. Believing his boy is gonna come
back is his whole reason for living.

22:17.697 --> 22:19.490
Where you going?

22:20.533 --> 22:23.285
Dillon took Becky to some place
called 'Carrilo'.

22:24.578 --> 22:26.372
That must be Carrillo.

22:26.372 --> 22:28.249
Carrillo!

22:28.249 --> 22:30.001
That's where she gets murdered.

22:31.585 --> 22:33.421
(ENGINE STARTS)

22:33.421 --> 22:35.548
That bike belongs to his son!
Who's dead.

22:35.548 --> 22:38.634
You don't know that!
Hey, I was over there, OK?

22:38.634 --> 22:41.637
I saw guys blown apart around me,
all right?

22:41.637 --> 22:44.306
So don't you talk to me about it!
Stop it!

22:44.306 --> 22:48.477
Hey, hey, hey! I just don't want to
see a cherry bike like that robbed

22:48.477 --> 22:50.521
while some old coot
waits for a ghost, OK?

22:50.521 --> 22:52.314
You're drunk!

22:52.314 --> 22:54.483
Come on, baby, let's play, huh?

22:54.483 --> 22:58.154
You're drunk! You don't even know
what's happening!

22:58.154 --> 23:00.531
Write about it.
I'll read it in the morning.

23:00.531 --> 23:02.575
Stop it!

23:02.575 --> 23:04.368
You're hurting me!

23:09.290 --> 23:11.042
Hey...

23:11.959 --> 23:13.669
Go ahead.

23:15.880 --> 23:19.050
What's the matter, man?
Your old lady turning you to mush?

23:19.050 --> 23:21.010
(LAUGHTER)

23:27.725 --> 23:29.560
Dillon, no.

23:29.560 --> 23:33.564
Do it, man.
BIKERS: Do it!

23:38.263 --> 23:39.973
Stop!

(SHOUTING)
Let's go!

24:09.127 --> 24:11.421
What a bunch of geniuses I got (!)

24:14.174 --> 24:15.967
They're both dead.

24:15.967 --> 24:18.011
(COUGHING)

24:20.514 --> 24:22.224
They're both dead.

24:35.904 --> 24:37.989
Get the hell out of here!
Whoa!

24:37.989 --> 24:41.701
Get the hell out of here unless
you want to take some buckshot.
Hold on, old man.

24:41.701 --> 24:44.329
I called the Sheriff,
and they're gonna be here soon.

24:44.329 --> 24:47.791
For what? To arrest all of you
for stealing my boy's bike.

24:47.791 --> 24:49.709
We didn't steal it.

24:49.709 --> 24:53.171
No, you sent that sprawny one
to go and do it for you.

24:54.548 --> 24:57.759
Bone stole the Black Shadow?
Boy, don't play no fool with me.

24:57.759 --> 25:00.595
Listen, I don't know anything
about it.

25:01.763 --> 25:03.807
I want them as bad as you do.

25:03.807 --> 25:06.852
(LAUGHS) Well, you ain't never gonna
catch him,

25:06.852 --> 25:08.687
cos he's halfway to the border
by now.

25:11.106 --> 25:14.776
I will catch him, don't you worry.
I will get your bike, too.

25:14.776 --> 25:16.570
Come on, let's go.

25:16.570 --> 25:18.613
(ENGINES START)

25:24.911 --> 25:26.955
All right.
They're gone?

25:26.955 --> 25:29.124
They're gone, they're headed south.

25:29.124 --> 25:31.877
Guess you and her'll be
heading north, huh?

25:31.877 --> 25:35.338
Yeah. Listen, thanks from me.
My pleasure.

25:35.338 --> 25:37.758
And you take care of yourself,
honey, all right?

25:37.758 --> 25:39.718
Let's go.
I can't.

25:39.718 --> 25:41.511
What?
You go.

25:41.511 --> 25:44.556
Becky, if Dillon comes back -
He'll hurt you.

25:44.556 --> 25:46.433
He'll hurt you.

25:46.433 --> 25:48.393
He was just drunk.

25:48.393 --> 25:51.438
I mean, he'll sober up,
he'll be OK tomorrow.

25:51.438 --> 25:54.608
Sooner or later he's gonna hurt you.
It's just a matter of time.

25:54.608 --> 25:56.985
I told you, I'm not going.

26:03.992 --> 26:07.204
Well, if you ain't going,
I guess you're staying.

26:07.204 --> 26:09.706
I got this spare room above
my garage,

26:09.706 --> 26:11.875
it's yours for the night.

26:11.875 --> 26:15.462
And maybe if you get some sleep
you'll wake up with some sense.

26:16.421 --> 26:18.173
But I doubt it.

27:16.690 --> 27:18.525
Someone's birthday?

27:21.695 --> 27:23.530
And Christmas.

27:25.490 --> 27:27.617
My God!

27:27.617 --> 27:30.370
He's saved his son's gifts
all these years.

27:30.370 --> 27:32.414
He's probably dead.

27:37.461 --> 27:39.337
Listen.

27:39.337 --> 27:42.466
You can't go back out with Dillon,
you know?

27:42.466 --> 27:44.760
I have to.

27:44.760 --> 27:47.637
Becky, come on.

27:49.014 --> 27:52.184
He was gonna rape you.
No, it was my fault.

27:52.184 --> 27:54.770
I embarrassed him in front of
all his friends.

27:56.646 --> 27:59.524
Shane, Dillon needs me.
Yeah, he needs you all right.

27:59.524 --> 28:02.444
He needs to own you.
No, he doesn't.

28:02.444 --> 28:04.988
You don't know him the way I do.

28:04.988 --> 28:08.033
The war, it did things to him.

28:08.033 --> 28:12.621
You know, sometimes in the middle
of the night, he wakes up crying...

28:12.621 --> 28:14.581
lost.

28:14.581 --> 28:16.416
And it scares me.

28:16.416 --> 28:20.587
And all I can do is just hold him
until he feels safe again.

28:20.587 --> 28:22.631
Shane, they hurt him.

28:22.631 --> 28:24.674
That doesn't give him the right
to hurt you.

28:27.094 --> 28:29.054
Don't you see what's happening
to you?

28:30.222 --> 28:32.349
Your father abused you,

28:32.349 --> 28:35.811
and Dillon is abusing you,

28:35.811 --> 28:38.730
and if you're not careful,
the next guy is gonna be some jerk

28:38.730 --> 28:41.983
who drinks too much, and beats you
and then what are you going to do?

28:41.983 --> 28:43.777
Good night, Shane.

28:51.326 --> 28:55.705
She talks about 'On The Road'
like it's...like it's the Bible.

28:55.705 --> 28:59.584
Well hey, it's a great book.

29:00.877 --> 29:03.630
That book changed my life.
You too?

29:03.630 --> 29:05.507
Yeah.

29:05.507 --> 29:09.803
Sam, you're too young to remember
the 50s, but let me tell you.

29:09.803 --> 29:15.684
The 50s were...conformist,
materialistic,

29:15.684 --> 29:19.729
repressive, boring and stupid.

29:19.729 --> 29:23.525
And 'On The Road'
rebelled against all of that.

29:23.525 --> 29:27.279
For a lot of us,
Kerouac started a whole new world.

29:27.279 --> 29:31.908
It was a world of adventure
and spirituality,

29:31.908 --> 29:35.370
jazz in the coffee shops
and then rock 'n' roll.

29:35.370 --> 29:37.622
And then free love.

29:39.833 --> 29:41.626
Free love?

29:41.626 --> 29:43.795
I can see why he was your hero.

29:43.795 --> 29:47.090
Yeah, and...like I knew Kerouac.

29:49.176 --> 29:51.887
OK, all right, I didn't really
know him.

29:51.887 --> 29:55.223
Er, it was 58,
Plebe year at Annapolis,

29:55.223 --> 29:58.018
and he gave a reading
at St John's College.

29:58.018 --> 30:01.229
A bunch of us went
and we partied with him afterwards.

30:01.229 --> 30:03.064
Well, what was he like?

30:03.064 --> 30:05.692
Well, he was a little sad,
he was very drunk.

30:05.692 --> 30:08.612
But when he talked,
he lit up the room.

30:08.612 --> 30:12.407
He had a charisma that comes along
once in a generation.

30:12.407 --> 30:16.787
I think that Kerouac's
probably the only guy

30:16.787 --> 30:19.081
who could get her
to change her mind right now,

30:19.081 --> 30:22.250
or at least get her to think
about things.

30:22.250 --> 30:25.295
Well, he's just 10 miles
up the road. What?

30:25.295 --> 30:27.255
Yeah, I looked it up.

30:27.255 --> 30:30.258
All his biographies mention this
cabin where he used to write,

30:30.258 --> 30:33.261
and there's even a letter from there
to Allen Ginsberg,

30:33.261 --> 30:36.098
dated September 1st 1958.

32:01.767 --> 32:05.771
that underlies the essence,
the unborn essence of everything.

32:07.773 --> 32:10.275
I speak out for the road...

32:11.359 --> 32:14.529
..zen, apple pie,

32:14.529 --> 32:17.491
hustlers, pimps,

32:17.491 --> 32:21.036
crazy jazz truck stops,

32:21.036 --> 32:23.497
cops, criminals,

32:23.497 --> 32:26.291
and all the things
that blast past you

32:26.291 --> 32:31.755
while you're beedy-bopping down
that old highway to heaven and hell.

32:31.755 --> 32:34.549
Yeah, well, listen.

32:34.549 --> 32:36.384
She...

32:36.384 --> 32:38.678
She bought that, she bought all that

32:38.678 --> 32:41.056
and she ran away
cos she was in trouble.

32:41.056 --> 32:44.184
And see, now she's in bigger trouble.

32:44.184 --> 32:47.896
And I-I... I just need you
to talk to her.

32:50.232 --> 32:53.026
She's not my problem, man.

32:53.026 --> 32:55.362
Well, no, yeah, she is.
Why?

32:55.362 --> 32:59.074
When did every kid become
my problem?

32:59.991 --> 33:01.785
You wrote that book.

33:01.785 --> 33:04.204
Dig it.

33:05.330 --> 33:09.126
If it gets people to get up
and live,

33:09.126 --> 33:12.170
then I did what I was supposed to.

33:12.170 --> 33:13.964
The rest is on her.

33:13.964 --> 33:17.509
But she's 18. She's just a kid.

33:20.720 --> 33:25.600
And she... She believes every word
you wrote.

33:26.852 --> 33:31.481
And she's gonna destroy herself
trying to live your life.

33:32.941 --> 33:35.068
And all I want you to do,

33:35.068 --> 33:38.280
is just tell her to find her own.

33:38.280 --> 33:40.282
I can't help her.

33:42.701 --> 33:45.036
I am not a hero.

34:02.512 --> 34:05.557
INSIDE: # THE PLATTERS:
The Great Pretender

34:25.452 --> 34:27.411
Ernie?

34:30.998 --> 34:32.708
Ernie?

34:46.098 --> 34:47.974
I'm playing your song, Bone.

34:59.207 --> 35:00.834
Get in!
Get in there!

35:06.381 --> 35:09.634
Why? Why, Ernie?

35:09.634 --> 35:11.887
Why did you lie to us?

35:11.887 --> 35:14.723
I don't... I don't know
what you're talking about.

35:14.723 --> 35:16.850
Yeah, right, old man (!)
I made him.

35:16.850 --> 35:19.936
I forced him to put us up here
last night.

35:19.936 --> 35:22.355
He didn't want to, and I...
I made him.

35:23.732 --> 35:25.901
Bone.

35:25.901 --> 35:29.654
Bone, Bone, Bone,
Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone.

35:29.654 --> 35:33.617
You should be halfway to Mexico
by now, Bone.

35:34.993 --> 35:37.162
What happened, huh?

35:37.162 --> 35:39.206
What happened? Did...

35:40.791 --> 35:42.584
..you lose your sense of direction?

35:42.584 --> 35:44.586
Yeah, I er...

35:45.712 --> 35:48.298
We got a little...
I got turned around, and er...

35:48.298 --> 35:51.510
I erm... It was just, kind of...

35:51.510 --> 35:53.762
a boneheaded thing to do.

35:53.762 --> 35:56.807
You know. Kind of boneheaded.

35:56.807 --> 35:58.642
Why don't I find you funny any more?

36:00.685 --> 36:03.980
Come on, Dillon.
Let's get outta here.

36:03.980 --> 36:08.193
What? And skip the morning coffee?
(LAUGHTER)

36:09.194 --> 36:11.655
Particularly, I mean,
now that I'm here...

36:12.989 --> 36:14.991
..with all my friends,

36:14.991 --> 36:17.661
and all my loved ones?
MAN: That's us!

36:17.661 --> 36:20.497
Come on, Becky, don't you think
that would be a little rude?

36:20.497 --> 36:22.833
Hey look, why don't
you take everything

36:22.833 --> 36:27.170
that's in the cash register
and just go, OK?

36:27.170 --> 36:30.674
Crushed me. You crushed me, Ernie.

36:30.674 --> 36:33.760
Do you think we would rip
this place off

36:33.760 --> 36:37.013
after you had been so nice to us?

36:37.013 --> 36:38.849
Hm?

36:38.849 --> 36:41.017
That would be inhuman, Ernie.

36:41.017 --> 36:42.853
Don't do that.
Huh?

36:43.145 --> 36:45.397
Yeah.
MAN: Sweeten him up!

36:47.607 --> 36:49.568
But...

36:50.193 --> 36:52.362
lying is too,

36:52.362 --> 36:55.449
and you haven't been totally honest
with us.

36:55.449 --> 36:57.409
Not my stuff!
Stop!

36:58.326 --> 37:00.162
What? Oh, sweetie.

37:00.162 --> 37:02.956
What? What, hm? What?

37:02.956 --> 37:04.708
Just listen, all right?
Hey, hey!

37:10.464 --> 37:14.634
You, Bone, not only lost
your sense of direction,

37:14.634 --> 37:17.971
you...you lost your sense
of respect.

37:17.971 --> 37:21.141
Hm? Hm?

37:21.141 --> 37:24.144
Just let 'em go.
That's an option, isn't it?

37:24.144 --> 37:27.064
I say we waste him. (LAUGHS)

37:27.064 --> 37:29.357
BECKY: Come on, baby, I'm sorry.

37:29.357 --> 37:31.526
I'll never do it again,

37:31.526 --> 37:33.320
I promise.

37:35.072 --> 37:36.990
I don't know what got into me.

37:36.990 --> 37:39.242
I think I do, maybe...

37:39.242 --> 37:41.870
who got into you.

37:41.870 --> 37:43.872
(SMASHING)

37:43.872 --> 37:47.709
Look, listen to me, nobody
did anything to anybody, OK?

37:47.709 --> 37:50.212
Why?

37:50.212 --> 37:55.801
Why would I believe
a single thing you say now?

37:55.801 --> 37:57.677
Because it's the truth!

37:57.677 --> 38:00.764
Oh, no, it's not the truth.

38:01.807 --> 38:04.142
(MOTORBIKE ENGINE OUTSIDE)
That is the truth.

38:04.142 --> 38:06.895
MAN: Yeah, Dog!
MAN: Mad Dog!

38:08.397 --> 38:11.900
Hey! Hey, you get off that bike!
That's my boy's bike.

38:16.071 --> 38:18.365
That's Darrell's bike!

38:18.365 --> 38:20.492
You get off that bike!

38:20.492 --> 38:22.369
That's my son's bike!

38:25.372 --> 38:28.291
What did you say? I said,
please get off my son's bike!

38:30.711 --> 38:32.504
Stay there, old man.

38:36.717 --> 38:39.636
You're a tough guy, aren't you,
picking on an old man? Come on!

38:39.636 --> 38:41.513
How about you? Come on.

38:41.513 --> 38:43.724
Come on, buddy. It's time.

38:43.724 --> 38:45.559
Let him go.
Come on.

38:45.559 --> 38:47.519
Come on.

38:47.519 --> 38:49.563
(SHOUTING / JEERING)

38:51.398 --> 38:53.150
Come on.

38:58.780 --> 39:02.200
MAN: Oh, Mad Dog.
MAN: Get up, Mad Dog!

39:02.200 --> 39:04.619
Damn, sir!
You OK?

39:04.619 --> 39:06.913
Yeah.
Get him out of here!

39:08.331 --> 39:13.754
So...Bone knows a little taekwondo.

39:13.754 --> 39:17.507
BECKY: Don't fight him! He won't
hurt you if you don't fight back.

39:17.507 --> 39:19.760
Come on, Bone, let's see
what you got.

39:19.760 --> 39:22.054
If you don't fight, he can't do it.
Shut up.

39:22.054 --> 39:24.514
Can't even do it in bed
unless you fight him! Shut up!

39:30.979 --> 39:33.065
AL: Sam!

39:33.065 --> 39:35.150
Al!

39:35.150 --> 39:36.818
Come on!
Duck!

39:36.818 --> 39:38.653
Kick!

39:41.031 --> 39:42.741
Uh-oh.

39:43.283 --> 39:45.494
Come on, Sam, you can take this guy.

39:55.629 --> 39:57.631
MAN: Let's go!
MAN: Get outta here!

40:13.021 --> 40:15.273
You know, Sam, I hate to say it,

40:15.273 --> 40:18.235
but this doesn't look like
it's working out right.

40:18.235 --> 40:20.153
What?

40:20.153 --> 40:24.282
Well, they put Mad Dog
in the hospital for three weeks
and then he got out.

40:24.282 --> 40:26.702
Then he hooked up
with his buddy Dillon again.

40:27.869 --> 40:30.205
Oh, in jail.
Hooked up with him in jail.

40:31.665 --> 40:33.375
What about Becky?

40:35.460 --> 40:37.295
What about Becky?

40:37.295 --> 40:39.005
Er...

40:40.257 --> 40:42.801
I guess you'll be going home now,
huh?

40:42.801 --> 40:45.971
No. I can't go home.

40:53.353 --> 40:55.188
I don't know what I'm going to do.

40:55.188 --> 40:59.359
Well, Ziggy...don't have
any information on Becky.

40:59.359 --> 41:01.570
She just, kind of, disappeared.

41:06.575 --> 41:08.410
Ernie, er...

41:10.287 --> 41:14.291
Didn't you say something about
needing an extra hand around here?

41:14.291 --> 41:16.084
Me?
Uh-huh.

41:16.084 --> 41:18.545
Oh yeah, I did, I did.

41:18.545 --> 41:21.089
You know, I got that spare room
over my garage,

41:21.089 --> 41:22.966
and it's piled full of books.

41:22.966 --> 41:24.718
Ernie, I can't.

41:26.845 --> 41:29.473
I've got to live life
if I'm gonna be a writer.

41:31.808 --> 41:33.643
I've got to stay on the road.

41:34.853 --> 41:39.816
Being on the road doesn't mean that
you literally have to be on the road,

41:39.816 --> 41:41.693
I don't think.

41:41.693 --> 41:46.698
I mean, I think it's more about
the journey of life, maybe,

41:46.698 --> 41:49.284
and you can start that right here.

41:49.284 --> 41:51.745
No.

41:51.745 --> 41:54.623
No, I've got to see, I've got to do.

41:54.623 --> 41:57.542
I've got to move,
I've got the groove...

42:00.212 --> 42:03.048
..away from the rumbling hooves

42:03.048 --> 42:05.759
of suffocating mediocrity.

42:05.759 --> 42:08.512
That's what you were thinking,
wasn't it?

42:09.763 --> 42:11.556
Oh my God!

42:14.226 --> 42:17.229
You're Jack Kerouac.
It's Jack Kerouac.

42:17.229 --> 42:20.774
I was talking to a friend the
other day about this very subject.

42:22.567 --> 42:24.611
He was illuminating...

42:25.696 --> 42:28.281
..like a thunderstorm at midnight.

42:28.281 --> 42:33.453
And when I overheard your dilemma,
on my quest for a cup of coffee,

42:33.453 --> 42:36.873
I couldn't help but be reminded
of it and other things.

42:36.873 --> 42:40.919
On the wheel of life we all
go around, we are many people,

42:40.919 --> 42:42.629
at many times.

42:43.672 --> 42:47.175
We all go through phases of motion,

42:47.175 --> 42:50.220
devotion of the notion,

42:50.220 --> 42:52.305
of living on the edge...

42:53.890 --> 42:57.352
..of life, or of a continent.

42:59.730 --> 43:02.274
But the road is not made of asphalt,

43:02.274 --> 43:05.235
but of the people we meet.

43:05.235 --> 43:09.448
And each of us is on a different
journey, and that's OK.

43:10.907 --> 43:15.829
So sometimes it's OK to get off
the road we ride on wheels,

43:15.829 --> 43:20.459
and just stay.

43:22.419 --> 43:24.171
Something will come of it.

43:25.756 --> 43:28.216
Cos that's a world
worth writing about too.

43:36.475 --> 43:38.643
ERNIE: Say, my man,
how about that er...

43:38.643 --> 43:40.479
cup of coffee?

43:40.479 --> 43:44.066
Oh, I'll come back later,
when it's hot.

43:56.578 --> 43:58.288
Bye.

44:05.087 --> 44:07.089
What did you say to him last night?

44:07.089 --> 44:10.342
I guess, more than I thought I did.

44:10.342 --> 44:12.219
What?

44:12.219 --> 44:15.639
I was just thinking,
when he said coffee,

44:15.639 --> 44:20.102
it reminded me that I wanted a cup
of coffee more than I thought I did.

44:20.102 --> 44:22.062
Which reminded me,

44:22.062 --> 44:26.149
that Ernie still has a job opening
here for someone.

44:26.149 --> 44:28.402
Yes indeedy.

44:28.402 --> 44:31.905
I mean, I... I really like
having young folks here again.

44:37.828 --> 44:39.579
Go on, take it.

44:42.332 --> 44:44.042
OK.

44:45.544 --> 44:48.338
You've got yourself a waitress.
All right!

44:49.089 --> 44:51.049
She's got a friend, too.

44:51.049 --> 44:54.928
Ernie's still alive, she probably
helped him through the news
of his son's death.

44:54.928 --> 44:57.389
And she makes it as a novelist.

44:57.389 --> 45:00.726
She's got a nice house in Carmel
with an incredible ocean view.

45:07.149 --> 45:08.942
Thanks.

45:08.942 --> 45:11.069
You're welcome.

45:12.696 --> 45:14.406
And welcome home.
