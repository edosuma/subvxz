00:24.125 --> 00:27.833
<i>Marius, we've had a few calls</i>
<i>that Ørum's cows have escaped again.</i>

00:30.291 --> 00:32.041
Did you call him? Over.

00:33.916 --> 00:35.083
<i>There is no reply.</i>

00:35.666 --> 00:38.291
<i>I'll tell your wife you are delayed. Over.</i>

00:39.083 --> 00:41.791
I'll swing by Ørum's.
That's okay, Jytte. Over and out.

ISLAND OF MØN, 1987

01:35.083 --> 01:35.916
Ørum?

01:40.666 --> 01:41.541
Ørum?

01:48.958 --> 01:51.583
Ørum? Your cows have escaped again.

02:01.625 --> 02:02.458
Ørum?

02:23.166 --> 02:25.291
Be quiet now.

02:31.666 --> 02:32.500
Ørum?

02:34.000 --> 02:34.833
Hello?

02:45.916 --> 02:47.958
Damn.

02:48.500 --> 02:49.583
Holy crap.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.500
It's Marius, from the police!

03:56.833 --> 03:57.708
No…

04:11.583 --> 04:12.833
<i>Police, Jytte speaking.</i>

04:12.916 --> 04:15.583
It's me. Please dispatch
an ambulance to Ørum's farm.

04:15.666 --> 04:17.583
-<i>What happened?</i>
<i>-</i>I have three dead victims.

04:17.666 --> 04:19.958
And one injured boy,
who's still breathing.

04:20.041 --> 04:22.250
-<i>The oldest boy?</i>
-No, not him.

04:22.333 --> 04:25.791
It's the youngest.
One of the two foster children.

04:25.875 --> 04:27.500
<i>Where's the foster girl?</i>

04:30.541 --> 04:33.958
Send everything you've got!
And launch a search for Ørum.

04:34.041 --> 04:35.708
<i>Just get out of the house!</i>

04:49.833 --> 04:50.875
Police!

05:50.958 --> 05:54.250
There… Quiet. Easy now.

05:55.500 --> 05:56.500
There you go.

05:57.916 --> 06:00.500
Don't be afraid. I'm a police officer.

06:01.416 --> 06:04.083
My name is Marius,
and I'm here to help you.

06:05.750 --> 06:07.458
You're Astrid, right?

06:10.625 --> 06:11.791
Do you live down here?

COPENHAGEN, PRESENT DAY

07:24.458 --> 07:28.666
TUESDAY, 6 OCTOBER

07:46.791 --> 07:48.250
You need to leave now!

08:04.833 --> 08:05.666
See you.

08:14.166 --> 08:16.625
-What do you want on the other one?
-Chocolate.

08:17.500 --> 08:19.250
We agreed to eat healthier, right?

08:24.125 --> 08:25.291
We'll start tomorrow.

08:27.958 --> 08:29.375
Did you pack up for school?

08:30.958 --> 08:32.333
Remember the crispy onions.

08:42.291 --> 08:43.750
Le, come on. Get ready.

08:45.083 --> 08:47.500
The teachers get annoyed when we're late.

08:48.208 --> 08:50.458
I have to hand in my family tree today.

08:51.083 --> 08:54.000
-You didn't help.
-Grandpa said you were done.

08:54.083 --> 08:55.291
The leaves are missing.

08:55.375 --> 08:57.875
You should have thought of that earlier.
Come on.

08:57.958 --> 09:00.666
And look both ways
when you go to after-school club.

09:00.750 --> 09:03.916
-My family tree is boring.
-No, it's great. Stop it.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.333
Hassan has way more photos on his.
I just have you and Grandpa.

09:07.416 --> 09:11.708
-And Grandpa's not even my real grandpa.
-Five if you count Bunny and Birdie.

09:11.791 --> 09:15.833
-The others don't have animals on theirs.
-No, they're not as lucky.

09:15.916 --> 09:17.166
What about Sebastian?

09:19.041 --> 09:20.250
What about him?

09:20.333 --> 09:23.625
I know you sleep together.
Even if you didn't think I knew that.

09:23.708 --> 09:25.750
Yeah, but we are not together.

09:30.708 --> 09:35.208
Fine. Then we'll invite him
for dinner tonight if you'd like.

09:35.291 --> 09:37.500
-Can I put him on my tree then?
-No.

09:38.375 --> 09:40.750
Hurry on in.
Grandpa will pick you up later.

09:40.833 --> 09:43.333
And soon I'll be picking you up every day.

09:43.916 --> 09:45.458
-Okay. Bye!
-Bye!

09:48.500 --> 09:52.791
<i>It's the first Tuesday in October,</i>
<i>which means Parliament opens today.</i>

09:52.875 --> 09:55.958
<i>But the focus today</i>
<i>won't be on the Queen or prime minister,</i>

09:56.041 --> 09:58.708
<i>but on the minister of social affairs,</i>
<i>Rosa Hartung.</i>

09:58.791 --> 10:04.875
<i>She's returning for the first time</i>
<i>since her daughter was murdered last year.</i>

10:04.958 --> 10:08.416
<i>All of Denmark followed the case</i>
<i>which lead to a review</i>

10:08.500 --> 10:10.458
<i>on safeguarding</i>
<i>and indeterminate sentences…</i>

10:10.541 --> 10:11.500
Idiot.

10:11.583 --> 10:13.208
<i>…as the perpetrator</i>
<i>had a previous record.</i>

10:13.291 --> 10:16.333
<i>-I have a meeting with Nylander.</i>
<i>-He's already in a meeting.</i>

10:16.416 --> 10:20.000
Not again!
He's canceled on me twice already.

10:20.083 --> 10:22.000
Sorry. There is nothing I can do.

10:22.083 --> 10:22.916
But…

10:23.541 --> 10:25.875
-Nylander!
-We were promised more resources.

10:25.958 --> 10:30.083
-You just got a new employee.
-The guy Europol doesn't want? Seriously?

10:30.166 --> 10:31.791
-Do you have a moment?
-Not now.

10:31.875 --> 10:33.750
-That's okay. We're done.
-No, we…

10:35.083 --> 10:38.708
When we solved the Hartung case,
my department was promised resources.

10:39.375 --> 10:42.958
If that money goes elsewhere,
the Commissioner will read about it!

10:43.041 --> 10:46.875
-Tell him that.
-We'll talk about it another time. Again.

10:48.000 --> 10:48.833
Good morning.

10:48.916 --> 10:52.083
Whatever it is,
it'll have to wait until next week.

10:52.166 --> 10:54.375
I've decided to apply with NC3.

10:56.500 --> 10:57.500
Why did you do that?

10:58.166 --> 11:00.958
They've posted a position
I'd like to apply for.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.583
-Is this about your hours?
-No.

11:03.666 --> 11:06.041
We can talk about that.
Or is it something else?

11:06.125 --> 11:07.791
-Is it?
-No, it's not. No.

11:07.875 --> 11:11.041
You're a great investigator.
I want you in my department.

11:11.875 --> 11:13.791
You can always join the IT nerds later

11:13.875 --> 11:16.458
and be bored stiff
working 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.

11:16.541 --> 11:18.041
I've made my decision.

11:18.125 --> 11:21.125
I'd really appreciate it
if you could give me a reference.

11:21.208 --> 11:23.416
We'll have to see. I can't do it now.

11:24.333 --> 11:27.041
Take this file for now.
A dead woman in Husum.

11:27.125 --> 11:29.750
-Bring that guy, Hess.
-Hess?

11:29.833 --> 11:33.458
The Europol guy they saddled us with
while they decide if they're firing him.

11:33.541 --> 11:36.333
Off you go. Genz is waiting.
He's been asking for you.

11:37.291 --> 11:38.166
Come on.

11:39.250 --> 11:41.250
NC3? Good grief, Thulin?

11:50.208 --> 11:52.916
<i>The flags are already flying</i>
<i>here at Parliament.</i>

11:53.000 --> 11:54.750
<i>It's always cause for celebration</i>

11:54.833 --> 11:58.250
<i>when Parliament reopens</i>
<i>on the 1st Tuesday in October.</i>

11:58.333 --> 12:03.208
<i>Shortly, the stairs behind me will be</i>
<i>packed with reporters and photographers</i>

12:03.291 --> 12:06.250
<i>as all the ministers</i>
<i>and members of Parliament arrive.</i>

12:06.333 --> 12:09.083
But today is a lot different than usual.

12:09.166 --> 12:12.791
Today, everyone is waiting to see
one particular person.

12:12.875 --> 12:16.333
I'm of course talking about
social minister Rosa Hartung.

12:16.916 --> 12:19.625
Rosa Hartung is returning
to her ministerial post

12:19.708 --> 12:22.458
after her 12-year-old daughter
was abducted and killed

12:22.541 --> 12:25.041
almost a year ago by Linus Bekker…

12:25.125 --> 12:26.083
<i>Vogel speaking.</i>

12:26.166 --> 12:29.250
Hi, it's Liv.
Everything is ready for her arrival.

12:29.333 --> 12:31.833
I made sure there is
plenty of her favorite coffee.

12:31.916 --> 12:33.416
<i>Sounds great, Liv.</i>

12:33.500 --> 12:37.833
-When do you think you'll be here?
<i>-I'll call you from the car.</i>

12:38.791 --> 12:42.208
-You haven't left yet?
<i>-No, but it is okay.</i>

12:42.291 --> 12:45.041
<i>-It's just taking a little while.</i>
-Is the minister okay?

12:51.083 --> 12:52.416
Rosa? Sweetie?

12:55.250 --> 12:57.208
They're here. They're waiting for you.

13:00.750 --> 13:01.625
Rosa?

13:05.041 --> 13:06.250
Did you eat?

13:08.083 --> 13:09.041
And are you ready?

13:10.250 --> 13:12.083
We're leaving as soon as Mom's gone.

13:13.666 --> 13:14.875
I'd rather ride my bike.

13:15.583 --> 13:16.541
No, I'll drive you.

13:18.041 --> 13:19.750
Everyone else is riding their bikes.

13:21.333 --> 13:23.625
We'll follow our normal routine.
Where's Mom?

13:24.791 --> 13:25.666
I don't know.

13:28.250 --> 13:29.125
Rosa?

13:31.416 --> 13:33.416
The car's outside. Vogel's here.

13:49.916 --> 13:52.166
I can't remember her scent anymore.
It's gone.

13:55.250 --> 13:56.166
Baby.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.958
Steen, I don't know if I…

14:07.666 --> 14:08.500
You can do it.

14:12.333 --> 14:13.791
She'd have been proud of you.

14:15.125 --> 14:15.958
You know?

14:21.458 --> 14:22.708
Come on!

14:28.416 --> 14:31.333
-When do you finish today?
-I'll pick up Gustav.

14:33.666 --> 14:35.875
-One day at a time.
-Exactly.

14:37.083 --> 14:38.250
One day at a time.

14:48.291 --> 14:49.916
Say hello to the new driver.

14:52.458 --> 14:54.833
-I'm Rosa.
-Jacob Rasouli. Here you go.

14:59.416 --> 15:00.625
Dad! Come on!

15:32.166 --> 15:33.500
How long are you here for?

15:34.375 --> 15:36.333
Probably just a couple of days.

15:36.416 --> 15:40.833
-Okay. You're based out of The Hague?
-No, I move around a bit.

15:41.916 --> 15:46.125
I'm part of a task force
in Amsterdam, Lisbon, Marseilles,

15:46.208 --> 15:48.833
Paris, Budapest, here and there.

15:48.916 --> 15:51.750
-How long have you been posted for?
-Five years.

15:51.833 --> 15:54.000
-Five years?
-I'll just borrow this.

15:55.416 --> 15:59.250
Most liaison officers
are only posted for two years, right?

15:59.333 --> 16:00.500
Oh? Okay.

16:02.333 --> 16:04.958
Is it okay with you
if I slip away at some point?

16:05.041 --> 16:08.958
-What do you mean?
-I need to sort out my apartment.

16:09.875 --> 16:11.375
Sure, you do that.

16:14.291 --> 16:16.875
Could you pull over here?
I'd like a cup of coffee.

16:23.291 --> 16:25.708
-Fine, we'll grab it on the way back.
-Sure.

16:45.625 --> 16:48.208
Let me just call my partner.

17:03.291 --> 17:06.541
The victim is Laura Kjær, 37 years old.

17:06.625 --> 17:09.750
Dental nurse at a practice
in central Copenhagen.

17:11.125 --> 17:14.000
It looks like she went to bed
and was caught off guard.

17:14.083 --> 17:16.166
The lock on the basement door was forced.

17:19.708 --> 17:24.666
Her ten-year-old son was asleep upstairs
and woke up to an empty house.

17:24.750 --> 17:28.208
He got dressed, made his own breakfast
and waited for his mom.

17:29.125 --> 17:31.000
Then he went to the neighbor's.

17:31.958 --> 17:34.250
The neighbor came to the house,
which was empty.

17:35.166 --> 17:39.333
She heard a dog bark in the playground,
found the victim and called us.

17:40.750 --> 17:42.000
The neighbor said

17:42.083 --> 17:45.500
that the victim and her son
went to the playground almost every day.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.708
The father died of cancer a few years ago.

17:49.791 --> 17:53.291
Her new partner is in the photos.
Hans Henrik Hauge.

17:53.375 --> 17:56.708
He's at an IT fair in Roskilde.
He's been informed and is on his way.

17:56.791 --> 17:59.708
-Witnesses?
-Not yet, but we're going door to door.

17:59.791 --> 18:01.958
-And the boy?
-He's with the neighbor.

18:02.041 --> 18:04.625
-Did he see anything? Or hear anything?
-I doubt it.

18:05.458 --> 18:09.208
We tried talking to him, but he wasn't
really with us. He didn't say a word.

18:09.833 --> 18:11.708
He's being assessed.

18:11.791 --> 18:14.041
APPOINTMENT
ASSESSMENT & DIAGNOSIS

18:17.625 --> 18:21.416
-Do you want to talk to him?
-No, later. Make sure he's okay.

18:21.500 --> 18:23.916
-Did they steal anything?
-Not as far as we know.

19:03.208 --> 19:04.125
Hi, Genz.

19:05.125 --> 19:06.125
How is it going?

19:06.708 --> 19:08.625
Not great. The rain compromised the scene.

19:10.458 --> 19:11.583
Time of death?

19:13.291 --> 19:18.000
It started raining around midnight,
so I'm guessing it was around that time.

19:21.041 --> 19:25.000
If there were footprints on the ground,
they've been washed away.

19:25.708 --> 19:26.541
Want to see her?

19:35.375 --> 19:39.041
There's barely any sign of struggle
in the house, and her feet are clean,

19:39.125 --> 19:43.375
so I think she was drugged in the house
and then carried out here.

19:51.125 --> 19:55.333
Judging by her injuries, she woke up
out here and tried to defend herself.

19:55.416 --> 19:58.500
-Right up until the amputation.
-Amputation?

20:02.625 --> 20:03.500
There.

20:04.875 --> 20:06.208
It's quite unusual.

20:07.041 --> 20:09.208
That's why
I felt you should investigate it.

20:10.541 --> 20:12.958
The freight trains run past all night,

20:13.041 --> 20:16.208
and the neighbors are far,
which explains why nobody heard anything.

20:17.791 --> 20:20.666
-Did you find it?
-The hand? No, not yet.

20:21.666 --> 20:22.916
Could it be a dog?

20:23.833 --> 20:25.708
-That took the hand?
-Sorry, who's he?

20:26.666 --> 20:31.166
This is Hess, he's here for a few days.
Genz runs the forensics institute.

20:31.791 --> 20:33.375
-Welcome.
-Thank you.

20:34.833 --> 20:37.916
Yes, it could've been a dog.
That's all we have, sorry.

20:38.000 --> 20:38.833
What's that?

20:48.375 --> 20:49.583
A chestnut man.

20:50.791 --> 20:52.250
Should we question him too?

20:53.666 --> 20:55.125
Bring it just in case.

21:13.208 --> 21:15.500
You meet with the ministers over breakfast

21:15.583 --> 21:18.791
before the church service
and the official opening.

21:20.291 --> 21:21.125
Rosa?

21:22.250 --> 21:23.083
Rosa?

21:24.000 --> 21:26.083
I'd like to see Liv and the others first.

21:26.833 --> 21:28.625
Let's do that before the opening.

21:28.708 --> 21:31.708
And I know
you'd also like a meeting with Bukke?

21:37.041 --> 21:41.625
-Jacob, just take us around to the back.
-No, it's fine. Let's stop here.

21:44.666 --> 21:46.291
We may as well get it over with.

21:48.166 --> 21:50.666
Rosa, what's it like being back?

21:50.750 --> 21:53.541
Do you still hope to find your daughter?

21:53.625 --> 21:56.791
Rosa, should violent offenders
be given harsher punishments?

22:04.875 --> 22:07.833
As you all know,
this past year has been difficult.

22:08.833 --> 22:13.333
My family and I are grateful
for all of the support we have had.

22:13.916 --> 22:15.583
But it's time to face the future.

22:16.416 --> 22:20.125
I'm pleased with the confidence
shown in me by the prime minister

22:20.208 --> 22:23.750
in allowing me once again
to fight for what I believe in

22:23.833 --> 22:25.833
as minister of social affairs.

22:26.708 --> 22:30.833
That's what I'll be focusing on.
I hope you'll all respect that.

22:31.750 --> 22:32.666
Thanks.

22:42.583 --> 22:47.541
If you hand me your coat, I'll get
the coffee on so we can get started.

22:48.166 --> 22:49.000
Thanks, Liv.

22:50.000 --> 22:53.083
The flowers are pouring in.
The PM sent a card.

22:53.166 --> 22:54.875
She is expecting you later today.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
Yes, it'll be nice to get started.

23:00.125 --> 23:04.375
We've redecorated, but we've not
hung the pictures in the corner yet.

23:06.583 --> 23:09.250
They'll hang them wherever you want.

23:16.083 --> 23:18.916
First, we need to line up meetings
for the afternoon.

23:19.458 --> 23:22.000
My work email was down
when I checked earlier.

23:22.083 --> 23:25.416
It still is. The Permanent Secretary
is looking into it.

23:26.291 --> 23:28.208
Why is Engells checking my email?

23:30.166 --> 23:31.958
I'll let him explain all that.

23:32.541 --> 23:34.125
Let me make that coffee.

23:35.250 --> 23:37.791
Liv? Hey, what's going on?

23:40.541 --> 23:43.041
You've received so many lovely emails.

23:43.125 --> 23:45.958
I don't get
why anyone would write that other stuff.

23:46.041 --> 23:46.916
What stuff?

23:48.791 --> 23:51.750
From what the Secretary said,
it was a threat.

23:51.833 --> 23:53.041
About your daughter.

23:56.500 --> 23:58.875
Get the names
of the children from the playground

23:58.958 --> 24:01.208
and the dog walkers in the area. Thanks.

24:01.291 --> 24:02.291
Okay.

24:02.375 --> 24:06.083
Check the bins when you search
the area for the murder weapon.

24:08.875 --> 24:11.708
Astrup, check their computers,
iPads and phones, please.

24:31.875 --> 24:33.541
I'm sorry. I had another call.

24:35.458 --> 24:39.041
-So? What should I do?
-I don't know. What can you do?

24:41.500 --> 24:43.875
Let me in, goddammit!

24:45.583 --> 24:47.333
I need to talk to Magnus!

24:51.166 --> 24:52.666
How long have you known Laura?

24:54.166 --> 24:55.000
Hans Henrik?

24:56.791 --> 24:58.458
What are you doing in the garage?

24:59.083 --> 25:02.416
-They found her on the playground?
-We'll talk about that in a bit.

25:03.791 --> 25:06.041
Answer me. How long have you known Laura?

25:07.875 --> 25:09.208
About a year.

25:09.291 --> 25:12.000
-I moved in after New Year's.
-Where did you meet?

25:12.916 --> 25:13.750
On the internet.

25:15.333 --> 25:17.791
I saw her profile
and sent her an email, and…

25:21.125 --> 25:22.458
When did you last see her?

25:24.041 --> 25:25.083
Yesterday morning.

25:26.250 --> 25:29.833
Before I left for the fair in Roskilde.
I'm an IT consultant.

25:30.916 --> 25:32.166
Did you speak yesterday?

25:33.083 --> 25:35.375
Last night after dinner…

25:37.583 --> 25:38.958
I called her.

25:39.041 --> 25:40.708
Nothing was out of the ordinary.

25:42.458 --> 25:43.375
How did she die?

25:44.750 --> 25:47.375
Why won't you tell me what happened?

25:50.750 --> 25:52.000
What did you talk about?

25:54.416 --> 25:55.708
Nothing really. We…

25:56.916 --> 26:00.166
-We talked about Magnus.
-Why didn't you drive home for the night?

26:00.750 --> 26:02.958
I was supposed to be there
until tomorrow afternoon.

26:03.041 --> 26:05.666
-My boss said we had to stay.
-So, there were others?

26:05.750 --> 26:09.125
Yes, everyone was there.
I went back to the motel around 9:00 p.m.

26:09.958 --> 26:12.166
Did anyone see you at the motel?

26:15.291 --> 26:19.458
-I'd like to speak to Magnus.
-Let's just finish this first.

26:20.583 --> 26:21.833
You were engaged?

26:23.500 --> 26:25.375
On which hand did she wear her ring?

26:27.958 --> 26:30.875
-The left one, I think. Why?
-Why did you change the locks?

26:33.250 --> 26:34.958
-We didn't.
-Yes, you did.

26:35.041 --> 26:37.375
The barrels are brand-new,

26:38.166 --> 26:41.208
and there was a locksmith's invoice
in the drawer.

26:41.291 --> 26:44.250
The locks were changed
yesterday at 3:30 p.m.

26:45.375 --> 26:48.458
Why did Laura change the locks
yesterday afternoon?

26:48.541 --> 26:50.083
Magnus, he…

26:52.416 --> 26:54.541
He's lost his keys a lot.

26:54.625 --> 26:57.541
They're assessing him for autism.

26:58.666 --> 27:00.458
I want to speak to Magnus now.

27:00.541 --> 27:02.375
Where is he? I need to see him.

27:04.833 --> 27:06.208
Please let me see him.

27:10.791 --> 27:13.666
<i>-He's hiding something.</i>
-Who? Hess?

27:13.750 --> 27:18.041
<i>Hauge, the victim's partner.</i>
<i>We can't confirm his alibi.</i>

27:18.125 --> 27:22.208
<i>He didn't know the victim</i>
<i>changed the locks before she was killed.</i>

27:22.291 --> 27:23.208
Okay.

27:23.291 --> 27:25.833
-Do we have enough to charge him?
<i>-Not yet.</i>

27:25.916 --> 27:29.041
<i>-We've no evidence, and I'm not sure.</i>
-Then work on it.

27:29.125 --> 27:31.625
-Call me after pathology.
<i>-And my reference?</i>

27:31.708 --> 27:33.083
Talk to you later!

27:36.666 --> 27:39.583
Get a mouth swab
and prints from the partner.

27:39.666 --> 27:41.500
Check his car too, all right?

27:41.583 --> 27:44.583
Let's get copies of
all communication between him and her.

27:44.666 --> 27:48.125
Texts, emails, likes on Instagram.

27:48.208 --> 27:49.583
Would you open the door?

27:49.666 --> 27:53.875
And everything from the dating site
they used when they met.

27:53.958 --> 27:54.833
Got it.

27:56.958 --> 27:59.333
-Which one was it?
-I don't know.

27:59.416 --> 28:02.333
I'll swing by pathology later.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
He's resistant to stress, huh?

28:07.625 --> 28:10.208
-Did you find the hand?
-No, sadly not.

28:12.125 --> 28:14.583
But do you think her partner did it?

28:15.916 --> 28:16.833
I don't know.

28:17.750 --> 28:20.250
Naia? When are we going for that run?

28:21.041 --> 28:23.000
Call me when you've got news.

28:27.125 --> 28:30.541
The threat was received
on your work email early this morning.

28:30.625 --> 28:33.583
The police were informed,
and I spent the morning--

28:33.666 --> 28:34.541
I want to see it.

28:35.583 --> 28:37.625
-You really don't have to--
-Show me.

28:49.125 --> 28:53.125
The police are checking the servers.

28:54.000 --> 28:57.875
To see if they can find out who sent it,
but so far…

29:01.833 --> 29:08.833
The pictures also had a message saying:
"I hope this hurts. You deserve to die."

29:11.708 --> 29:13.625
Those are Kristine's Instagram photos.

29:16.208 --> 29:18.041
We closed her account right after…

29:18.875 --> 29:21.791
That's one of
the more worrying factors about this.

29:22.666 --> 29:27.041
It means that whoever sent it
has been interested in you for a while.

29:28.583 --> 29:32.541
I've had hate mail before.
It's some poor soul, and it means nothing.

29:33.875 --> 29:38.375
The police think you need bodyguards.

29:38.458 --> 29:41.416
No more bodyguards.
I don't want Gustav to be scared again.

29:41.500 --> 29:45.416
-The police feel that the sender--
-You'll have to fix it.

29:47.250 --> 29:50.875
If that's all,
I'm off to my meeting with the PM now.

29:50.958 --> 29:51.833
Of course.

29:51.916 --> 29:53.750
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

29:56.291 --> 29:57.916
<i>You've reached Steen Hartung.</i>

29:58.000 --> 30:00.625
<i>Leave your name and number</i>,
<i>and I'll get back to you.</i>

30:05.333 --> 30:09.625
Sorry I didn't make the meeting.
Did I hear something about a threat?

30:09.708 --> 30:11.333
They used Kristine's photos.

30:11.416 --> 30:13.958
-Which photos?
-From her Instagram.

30:14.041 --> 30:15.166
What?

30:18.833 --> 30:22.875
I'll take care of it.
Just go to your meeting with the PM.

30:24.625 --> 30:25.458
Rosa.

30:27.916 --> 30:30.625
It is so good to see you.

31:00.583 --> 31:01.666
Kristine?

31:43.958 --> 31:44.875
Hi, sweetheart.

31:49.500 --> 31:51.500
So? How did it go?

31:53.708 --> 31:54.875
Don't pick me up again.

32:01.250 --> 32:02.958
The whole car stinks.

32:06.583 --> 32:07.416
Gustav…

32:08.500 --> 32:09.375
I'm really sorry.

32:09.958 --> 32:12.625
-I mean it.
-You're not the only one missing her.

32:19.541 --> 32:20.458
Just drive.

32:33.458 --> 32:36.458
She received
around 50 blows all over her body.

32:36.958 --> 32:41.333
Weapon was a blunt instrument
with a rough, granulated surface.

32:42.333 --> 32:44.416
Like a garden tool or…?

32:45.250 --> 32:47.625
Well, I'm don't know. Perhaps.

32:48.458 --> 32:51.291
-Any signs of sexual assault?
-No.

32:51.375 --> 32:54.041
Unless you're thinking
along sadistic lines.

32:55.416 --> 32:57.791
She was beaten very badly

32:59.125 --> 33:01.166
before the blow to the eye killed her.

33:02.458 --> 33:04.708
Her hand was severed
several minutes before.

33:05.750 --> 33:06.625
What with?

33:10.208 --> 33:12.958
Some kind of saw. Circular saw, jigsaw…

33:13.916 --> 33:17.166
Battery powered considering the location.
With a diamond blade.

33:17.250 --> 33:20.208
And her partner?
Did you find anything on him? DNA?

33:20.291 --> 33:22.583
-Any indication he did it?
-I'd like to help.

33:23.708 --> 33:25.791
It's an ugly case, but I've got nothing.

33:34.041 --> 33:36.458
-Genz?
<i>-Could you stop by please?</i>

33:36.541 --> 33:38.666
<i>-You need to see something.</i>
-I'm on my way.

33:41.958 --> 33:43.583
Sorry, it took me a while.

33:47.208 --> 33:50.583
-Any news?
-Why did Europol send you home?

33:50.666 --> 33:54.750
Was it bad policing
or alcohol or something else?

33:55.541 --> 33:57.375
I just need to talk to my boss.

33:57.458 --> 34:00.416
So you're stuck here
until they want to see you again.

34:00.500 --> 34:05.166
This means jack shit to you, so you're
just here doing as little as possible.

34:05.250 --> 34:09.208
-Am I right?
-Yes, and I need to sell my apartment.

34:18.041 --> 34:18.958
Hi Thulin.

34:35.291 --> 34:36.416
So? What have you got?

34:41.833 --> 34:44.458
-I thought you'd be alone.
-Any news about the hand?

34:45.416 --> 34:49.166
-I need to know that we can trust him.
-He's not here anyway.

34:54.083 --> 34:55.750
No news about the hand.

34:56.958 --> 34:57.791
But…

34:58.333 --> 35:01.791
I dusted the playground for prints,
in case he touched anything.

35:01.875 --> 35:03.916
I checked the chestnut man too.

35:04.000 --> 35:04.833
And?

35:07.166 --> 35:08.000
And…

35:09.750 --> 35:15.125
Normally, we're looking for ten points
to identify. I only found five.

35:15.791 --> 35:16.625
But…

35:18.041 --> 35:21.541
-It's still enough to call it evidence.
-Of what?

35:22.875 --> 35:25.125
Of this fingerprint being identical

35:26.125 --> 35:27.250
to Kristine Hartung's.

35:30.375 --> 35:31.666
Kristine Hartung?

35:32.750 --> 35:34.041
Rosa Hartung's daughter?

35:35.000 --> 35:36.666
I thought it was a mistake.

35:37.666 --> 35:40.541
-Kristine Hartung is dead.
-Yes, that's the problem.

35:42.541 --> 35:45.041
It must be a mistake.
The print can't be hers.

35:45.125 --> 35:48.708
-No, I ran the test three times!
-How old are the chestnuts?

35:48.791 --> 35:52.833
According to our expert,
they could be several years old.

35:54.625 --> 35:56.041
Who's Kristine Hartung?

36:03.291 --> 36:06.291
<i>Do not visit the Hartung family!</i>
<i>That case is closed.</i>

36:06.375 --> 36:07.708
Then how do we ascertain

36:07.791 --> 36:10.625
how her prints ended up
on a chestnut man in Husum?

36:10.708 --> 36:13.833
<i>All kids make chestnut men,</i>
<i>and fingerprints last for a long time.</i>

36:13.916 --> 36:18.916
But we need to ask the Hartungs
if there could be a logical explanation--

36:19.000 --> 36:21.791
<i>The print is there purely by coincidence.</i>

36:21.875 --> 36:23.625
<i>They've suffered enough.</i>

36:23.708 --> 36:26.958
Yes, I know what they've been through.
I'm just saying--

36:27.041 --> 36:28.750
<i>Focus on the partner.</i>

36:28.833 --> 36:29.875
<i>Got it?</i>

36:30.500 --> 36:32.458
<i>Good. We'll talk later.</i>

36:32.541 --> 36:34.375
-What's up?
-Nylander said no.

36:34.458 --> 36:36.750
-Why?
-We're not allowed to go there today.

36:36.833 --> 36:40.750
Rosa Hartung just returned to work.
It's her first day in Parliament, so…

36:42.041 --> 36:42.875
We have to wait.

36:44.458 --> 36:45.416
And do we wait?

36:50.666 --> 36:54.875
Suddenly, Lin gets up, the beautiful one
advocating for shopping hours.

36:55.791 --> 36:58.458
Anyway, she gets up
and starts insulting the PM.

36:58.541 --> 37:01.375
Half of the auditorium boos at her…

37:01.458 --> 37:04.875
She gets so angry,
she accidentally breaks her glasses.

37:08.750 --> 37:09.666
No, thanks.

37:10.708 --> 37:13.416
So you had a good day?
I saw your missed call.

37:15.166 --> 37:17.916
The day had a few challenges,
but I made it.

37:23.875 --> 37:26.250
We'll make it. Don't you agree?

37:30.041 --> 37:30.916
It's Liv.

37:32.083 --> 37:32.916
Hi, Liv.

37:35.833 --> 37:36.833
Yes, go ahead.

37:52.750 --> 37:53.708
Steen Hartung?

37:54.875 --> 37:58.333
Sorry to bother you.
We're from the police. May we come in?

37:59.291 --> 38:00.208
What's this about?

38:01.291 --> 38:03.416
It's probably best if we step inside.

38:05.333 --> 38:07.166
-Please.
-Thanks.

38:12.041 --> 38:16.625
-I think maybe your wife needs to be here?
-No, you can just talk to me.

38:17.208 --> 38:18.458
What do you want?

38:19.125 --> 38:22.375
It's a quite unusual,
but today at a crime scene,

38:22.458 --> 38:27.333
we found an object
bearing your daughter's fingerprints.

38:29.541 --> 38:30.541
What do you mean?

38:32.208 --> 38:33.250
What kind of object?

38:34.458 --> 38:37.875
The print was found on a chestnut man.

38:37.958 --> 38:41.875
But it's hard to say
how old the chestnuts are.

38:41.958 --> 38:45.041
We think it has no bearing
on Kristine's investigation.

38:45.125 --> 38:49.958
We're not absolutely sure,
but we'd like to find an explanation.

38:50.041 --> 38:55.083
-I'm sorry, I don't understand this.
-Do you recognize the name Laura Kjær?

38:56.916 --> 38:57.791
No.

38:57.875 --> 39:01.625
She lives by a playground in Husum.
At Cedervænget.

39:01.708 --> 39:05.250
Perhaps your daughter knew someone
in the area or had a playdate?

39:05.333 --> 39:08.958
No, we don't know anyone in Husum.
What's this all about?

39:09.041 --> 39:11.250
-May I have a glass of water?
-Sure.

39:14.875 --> 39:16.750
We're just sorting out a few details.

39:16.833 --> 39:19.125
As I mentioned, it may be nothing.

39:19.208 --> 39:21.708
If it's nothing, why are you here?

39:21.791 --> 39:23.625
-What's your theory?
-No theory.

39:24.166 --> 39:28.333
We're trying to establish
whether it's random or if it's connected

39:28.416 --> 39:30.208
to an ongoing murder investigation.

39:31.666 --> 39:32.625
Murder?

39:32.708 --> 39:35.833
Who was murdered?
Let me get this straight.

39:35.916 --> 39:38.416
My daughter's print
was found on a piece of evidence?

39:38.500 --> 39:42.000
Let me stress that this changes nothing
in your daughter's case.

39:42.083 --> 39:46.666
-We just need to understand how--
-She sold them by the main road.

39:49.500 --> 39:50.333
Every fall.

39:51.125 --> 39:54.916
With Mathilde from her year group.
They had a little stall…

39:56.500 --> 40:00.250
They baked cookies, made lemonade
and sold their chestnut men.

40:09.375 --> 40:12.708
Were they like this one,
using twigs instead of matches?

40:14.833 --> 40:17.958
-Yes.
-Do you know who may have bought them?

40:18.041 --> 40:21.041
Was it primarily parents
or was it their friends?

40:22.041 --> 40:25.083
No, it could have been anyone.

40:26.291 --> 40:28.333
You don't recall Kristine selling--

40:28.416 --> 40:31.458
That's what we thought.
I'm glad we got that confirmed.

40:32.583 --> 40:34.208
Thank you very much for your help.

40:37.500 --> 40:39.625
-Will you let yourselves out?
-Yes. Thanks.

40:49.541 --> 40:51.041
I told you I'd handle it.

40:51.541 --> 40:55.416
-They're adults.
-You can still be considerate.

41:02.416 --> 41:03.541
Are you okay?

41:07.416 --> 41:09.166
-Ready to eat?
-Sure…

41:10.958 --> 41:12.458
But someone was killed…

41:13.041 --> 41:15.500
And I don't understand the chestnut man.

41:15.583 --> 41:17.416
They said it had no bearing on her case.

41:22.375 --> 41:24.291
<i>Steen Hartung just called.</i>

41:24.375 --> 41:26.541
<i>I explicitly told you not to visit them.</i>

41:26.625 --> 41:28.916
I know, but we were nearby.

41:29.000 --> 41:32.500
We managed to confirm
that the print is probably coincidental.

41:32.583 --> 41:35.666
<i>Should I note in my reference</i>
<i>that you defy orders?</i>

41:35.750 --> 41:39.541
It's down to me,
but Hess isn't working out. I can't do it.

41:40.250 --> 41:42.166
-Can't he do something else?
<i>-No.</i>

41:42.250 --> 41:44.666
<i>Interview the partner, get some evidence.</i>

41:44.750 --> 41:45.875
<i>-</i>Yes, but…
<i>-Thanks!</i>

41:59.208 --> 42:00.041
Sebastian?

42:02.458 --> 42:03.583
I'm sorry…

42:05.166 --> 42:08.250
-Isn't anybody home?
-Sure, there is someone.

42:08.333 --> 42:12.875
-But the old-timer wouldn't let me in…
-No. Typical Aksel.

42:12.958 --> 42:13.791
Hi.

42:14.291 --> 42:17.500
-Hey.
-Flowers and ice cream. Fantastic.

42:20.375 --> 42:21.666
You forgot, didn't you?

42:21.750 --> 42:24.541
No, I didn't.
I was really looking forward to this.

42:25.291 --> 42:28.125
-Give me all your nines.
-Go fish!

42:30.208 --> 42:31.541
-Hi, Mom.
-Hi, sweetie.

42:32.875 --> 42:37.125
This is Sebastian.
Le and Aksel, Le's granddad.

42:37.208 --> 42:40.166
He's a retired police officer,
so he's a bit…

42:41.750 --> 42:44.625
I didn't mean to be rude,
but you never know.

42:44.708 --> 42:47.166
No, that's not a problem. No worries.

42:49.833 --> 42:50.750
You must be Le.

42:53.625 --> 42:54.750
Thanks for having me.

42:56.083 --> 42:57.875
I'll put the ice cream away.

42:59.916 --> 43:02.916
Oh, your mom's run off with the ice cream.

43:03.625 --> 43:06.958
How about we agree
that these flowers are for you then?

43:07.458 --> 43:09.083
-Thank you.
-Here you go.

43:09.583 --> 43:12.208
-Do you want to see my room?
-I'd love to.

43:12.291 --> 43:14.000
-It's this way.
-Okay.

43:18.500 --> 43:23.625
I know I'm late,
but I was assigned to a special case.

43:29.125 --> 43:32.916
Don't give me that look.
I did talk to Nylander.

43:35.541 --> 43:39.291
-Did you get a reference?
-The victim's hand was cut off.

43:44.833 --> 43:47.541
-Any pictures?
-No. I'll see you tomorrow. Bye.

43:49.583 --> 43:52.958
-What about food?
-In the freezer. Goulash.

43:53.041 --> 43:53.916
Thanks.

44:48.125 --> 44:51.500
<i>Rosa Hartung returned today</i>
<i>as Minister of Social Affairs.</i>

44:51.583 --> 44:55.541
<i>She's been on leave for the past year</i>
<i>since tragically losing her daughter.</i>

44:55.625 --> 44:58.500
<i>As you all know,</i>
<i>this past year has been difficult.</i>

44:58.583 --> 45:02.333
<i>My family and I are grateful for</i>
<i>all of the support we have had.</i>

45:02.416 --> 45:03.791
<i>It's time to look ahead.</i>

45:03.875 --> 45:07.416
<i>I'm pleased with the confidence</i>
<i>shown in me by the PM.</i>

45:25.666 --> 45:27.583
Who are you? What are you doing here?

45:28.208 --> 45:30.750
I live here. It's my apartment.

45:34.583 --> 45:37.666
Don't worry. I'm a police officer.

45:39.291 --> 45:40.166
Mark Hess.

45:41.958 --> 45:43.416
Nehru. I'm the caretaker.

45:46.125 --> 45:47.458
What's with the apartment?

45:48.208 --> 45:52.333
-Surveillance?
-No, I just wanted to paint it.

45:53.375 --> 45:55.583
-And sell it.
-That sounds like a good idea.

45:56.416 --> 46:00.500
By the way,
do you have any old newspapers?

46:01.333 --> 46:06.708
Yes, and if you need an estate agent,
I know one of those too.

46:07.625 --> 46:08.750
Five minutes.

46:35.083 --> 46:37.500
BODY NOT FOUND
WHERE IS KRISTINE HARTUNG?

46:41.791 --> 46:43.750
DISMEMBERED AND BURIED

46:46.916 --> 46:48.916
WHERE WAS SHE TAKEN?

46:57.583 --> 47:02.625
I think I must have
the oldest Labrador in the world.

47:02.708 --> 47:07.833
In the end,
I had to jump in after him fully clothed.

47:07.916 --> 47:09.791
I'm glad you saved him.

47:11.166 --> 47:13.916
-Do you want to see my family tree?
-No, not now.

47:15.458 --> 47:17.375
I'll just show you something else.

47:34.041 --> 47:35.416
Bad day at work?

47:36.000 --> 47:39.375
Everything's fine.
It's almost over, thankfully, so…

47:43.875 --> 47:46.666
I made these after school today.
You can have one.

47:46.750 --> 47:51.083
How funny. Chestnut men.
We made those when I was in school too.

47:51.166 --> 47:52.916
It is an old Labrador?

47:53.000 --> 47:55.666
No, it's a horse, but we can make a dog.

47:56.333 --> 47:58.625
I'd love to. Do you have any matches?

48:04.708 --> 48:07.125
Snap off the tip,
so they don't have hands.

48:12.500 --> 48:13.666
There we go.

48:15.916 --> 48:16.875
<i>Mom?</i>

48:18.166 --> 48:19.000
<i>Mom.</i>

48:21.291 --> 48:22.416
Mom, come and join us.

48:25.500 --> 48:27.416
-I have to leave.
-Now?

48:27.500 --> 48:28.583
Really, Mom.

48:32.666 --> 48:36.375
-<i>Yes?</i>
<i>-Aksel? I'm sorry to call so late.</i>

48:36.458 --> 48:41.791
<i>Can you watch Le? Just for an hour or so.</i>
<i>I have to do something.</i>

48:41.875 --> 48:44.000
<i>Sure. Give me 15 minutes.</i>

48:44.958 --> 48:47.625
You can't sit here. You need to leave.

48:49.833 --> 48:51.541
Then I'll have to get security.

48:52.416 --> 48:53.666
What are you doing here?

48:57.750 --> 49:01.833
I need to speak to the boy, but some moron
promised him no more visitors today.

49:01.916 --> 49:02.833
That was me.

49:03.625 --> 49:05.250
He's been through enough today.

49:06.291 --> 49:07.166
Naia Thulin.

49:10.666 --> 49:12.041
So what are you doing here?

49:16.500 --> 49:17.500
We'll be brief.

49:22.916 --> 49:24.666
-I'll talk to the boy.
-Sure.

49:27.000 --> 49:27.833
Hi, Magnus.

49:34.625 --> 49:36.000
Sorry to disturb you.

49:45.416 --> 49:49.625
We're from the police.
We'd like to talk to you if that's okay?

49:54.250 --> 49:59.125
-Could you turn that off for a minute?
-Is that the faction called "Accursed"?

50:00.333 --> 50:01.583
You're good at it.

50:08.458 --> 50:11.333
Magnus, could you take a short break?

50:12.875 --> 50:15.750
I have a mission for you
just like in the game.

50:15.833 --> 50:18.041
I need your help to solve it.

50:20.833 --> 50:21.916
Would you like that?

50:37.458 --> 50:40.666
Look at this, Magnus.
I have some photos here.

50:42.625 --> 50:46.166
You have five seconds to tell me

50:47.166 --> 50:49.583
if something in the photos
isn't as it should be.

50:51.750 --> 50:52.791
Are you up for it?

50:54.750 --> 50:57.500
It's a difficult mission.
You'll need all your skills.

50:58.833 --> 50:59.916
Let's start.

51:43.458 --> 51:44.333
What is it?

51:44.416 --> 51:45.833
You haven't seen it before?

51:47.083 --> 51:50.375
Are you sure the chestnut man
wasn't at the playground yesterday?

51:50.458 --> 51:53.916
-Magnus?
-Are you certain it wasn't there?

51:54.916 --> 51:55.958
Think carefully.

51:56.625 --> 51:58.750
Magnus, have another look.

52:03.375 --> 52:04.875
Is my mom not coming back?

52:18.583 --> 52:20.750
No, she's not, Magnus.

52:23.666 --> 52:26.958
Your mom's in a good place now.

52:29.291 --> 52:30.125
In heaven?

52:36.916 --> 52:38.416
Yes, in heaven.

52:47.583 --> 52:50.666
<i>Chestnut man</i>

52:50.750 --> 52:55.250
<i>Come on inside</i>
<i>Chestnut man</i>

52:55.333 --> 53:00.291
<i>Come on inside</i>
<i>Do you have some chestnuts</i>

53:00.375 --> 53:04.208
<i>For me today?</i>

53:04.291 --> 53:06.500
<i>Thank you</i>…

53:06.583 --> 53:08.958
Nylander has to reopen the Hartung case.

53:09.750 --> 53:11.041
Forget it.

53:11.125 --> 53:13.875
If the chestnut man was planted
at the time of the murder,

53:13.958 --> 53:15.750
the print is no coincidence.

53:15.833 --> 53:19.125
Could be.
Or the two cases may be unrelated.

53:19.625 --> 53:23.333
-You still think it's the partner?
-I didn't say that, but he has no alibi.

53:23.416 --> 53:27.541
<i>Come on inside</i>
<i>Chestnut man</i>

53:27.625 --> 53:29.833

53:37.000 --> 53:39.083
<i>For me today</i>
<i>Come on inside</i>…

53:39.166 --> 53:41.333
-The Hartung case was investigated.
-Was it?

53:41.416 --> 53:44.958
The perpetrator confessed.
He's locked up. Case closed.

53:45.041 --> 53:46.000
And that's fine?

53:46.083 --> 53:50.875
I don't want to tear another case apart
because I'm struggling to solve this one.

53:51.541 --> 53:55.958
<i>Come on inside</i>
<i>Chestnut man</i>

53:56.041 --> 53:57.916
