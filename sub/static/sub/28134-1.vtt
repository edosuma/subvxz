00:44.345 --> 00:47.480
That's why it's
the best possible solution.

00:47.481 --> 00:48.681
<i>Or you could just sell it,</i>

00:48.682 --> 00:50.183
<i>make a ton of money
and start over.</i>

00:50.184 --> 00:51.151
No way.

00:51.152 --> 00:54.154
I am not selling my family home.

00:54.155 --> 00:56.189
It's the easiest way
to make some extra money.

00:56.190 --> 00:58.525
It's unregulated,
and I can get to be my own boss.

00:58.526 --> 01:01.161
I mean,
how many people can say that?

01:01.162 --> 01:02.362
<i>It's not that easy, Alison.</i>

01:02.363 --> 01:03.496
<i>You've got to be careful
out there.</i>

01:03.497 --> 01:05.031
<i>You don't know
who you're letting in.</i>

01:05.032 --> 01:06.499
<i>I mean, I wouldn't want some
stranger living in my home.</i>

01:06.500 --> 01:07.900
They're not strangers,

01:08.002 --> 01:09.869
and it is totally safe.

01:09.870 --> 01:12.237
In fact, I'm meeting
with a family tonight.

01:12.339 --> 01:14.407
And they seem like
the perfect fit.

01:14.408 --> 01:17.443
Anyway, I'm gonna be late
for work.

01:17.545 --> 01:18.678
<i>But have you vetted them?</i>

01:18.679 --> 01:20.413
<i>I mean, like,
really checked them out?</i>

01:20.414 --> 01:21.748
I've seen their profile.

01:21.749 --> 01:23.216
He's in the tech industry,

01:23.217 --> 01:25.084
and his wife is a professional...

01:25.186 --> 01:26.553
And his kid is...

01:26.554 --> 01:27.921
well, a kid.

01:27.922 --> 01:29.556
<i>Well, the passive income
will certainly help,</i>

01:29.557 --> 01:31.758
at least until you get
a new law firm opening.

01:31.759 --> 01:34.426
Yeah, well,
I'm not going to hold my breath.

01:34.528 --> 01:36.029
<i>That's because
you haven't tried again.</i>

01:36.030 --> 01:37.397
<i>You've gone though a lot
this past year.</i>

01:37.398 --> 01:38.898
<i>Things are going to turn around
as soon as you're ready.</i>

01:38.899 --> 01:39.866
Trust me, I'm ready.

01:39.867 --> 01:42.035
Can we go home yet?

01:42.036 --> 01:43.403
Hey, this is
my seventh straight day,

01:43.404 --> 01:44.636
so don't even go there.

01:44.738 --> 01:46.872
Brandon is paying you
overtime, though, right?

01:48.242 --> 01:49.409
You just hung up on me.

01:49.410 --> 01:50.777
Don't be cute.

01:50.778 --> 01:53.546
You realize you have
the labor rights on your side?

01:53.547 --> 01:55.314
Okay, Ali, this isn't
Fairview Law,

01:55.416 --> 01:57.083
or whatever
law firm you worked for.

01:57.084 --> 01:58.084
Fairfax and Associates.

01:58.085 --> 01:59.619
Whatever.

01:59.620 --> 02:01.901
Down here on main street,
we take all the work we can get.

02:03.724 --> 02:05.058
Hey, has he asked you out yet?

02:05.059 --> 02:06.092
What?

02:06.093 --> 02:07.594
He told me he was going to.

02:07.595 --> 02:09.128
He says you can't use

02:09.130 --> 02:11.163
your "I'm still reeling
from my ex" excuse forever.

02:11.265 --> 02:14.434
I'm not reeling
and I'm not making excuses.

02:14.435 --> 02:16.803
Edwin was psychotic
and possessive.

02:16.804 --> 02:18.605
Yeah, well,
you don't have to tell me twice.

02:18.606 --> 02:19.606
I'm the one
who warned you about him.

02:19.607 --> 02:21.241
I'm aware, thanks.

02:21.242 --> 02:23.175
Anyway, Brandon may mean well,

02:23.277 --> 02:25.078
but if he asks you out,
like he did to all of us,

02:25.079 --> 02:26.613
just say no.

02:26.614 --> 02:27.947
Okay.

02:27.948 --> 02:29.582
Do you know how all men
interpret women

02:29.583 --> 02:31.850
who don't say no
to the smallest of advances?

02:31.952 --> 02:33.086
They think it means
you like them

02:33.087 --> 02:34.621
and that they have a chance
with you.

02:34.622 --> 02:36.256
I don't want to make a scene.
I need this job.

02:36.257 --> 02:37.257
Okay.

02:37.258 --> 02:39.024
Edwin might have
messed with your head,

02:39.126 --> 02:41.226
but you're still the strongest,
bravest woman I know.

02:42.763 --> 02:44.130
And if Brandon asks you out...

02:44.131 --> 02:45.131
Say no.

02:46.167 --> 02:48.268
Say no.
Got it.

02:48.269 --> 02:50.302
Okay. Trust me.

03:17.798 --> 03:19.565
Hi. Can I help you
with something?

03:19.667 --> 03:21.867
I bet you there's lots
of things you can help me with.

03:24.471 --> 03:27.140
Well, this is
an all-season couch.

03:27.141 --> 03:30.075
You could put it on your patio,
in your backyard,

03:30.177 --> 03:31.511
in your living room,

03:31.512 --> 03:32.945
so it's pretty great.

03:33.881 --> 03:35.481
Why don't you have a seat
here with me?

03:38.185 --> 03:39.352
I don't think
I can help you with that.

03:39.353 --> 03:40.320
Oh, no.

03:40.321 --> 03:42.921
Isn't it your job to help me...

03:43.023 --> 03:44.623
Alison?

03:49.496 --> 03:50.729
Do you have a question, sir?

03:50.831 --> 03:52.999
No.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.600
I'm alright.

03:54.702 --> 03:56.702
Thanks for your help.

03:57.738 --> 03:59.204
Have a nice day.

04:00.174 --> 04:01.273
You okay?
Yeah.

04:01.375 --> 04:03.009
Thanks, Mr. Matthews.

04:03.010 --> 04:04.210
Alison, please.

04:04.211 --> 04:06.111
I've told you,
you can call me Brandon.

04:07.214 --> 04:08.715
Listen, if anything like that
ever happens again...

04:08.716 --> 04:10.183
Nothing happened.

04:10.184 --> 04:13.019
Okay, all I'm saying
is that I'm here for you.

04:13.020 --> 04:14.754
For anything.

04:14.755 --> 04:15.787
Anything at all.

04:15.889 --> 04:18.057
I appreciate that,
Mr. Matthews.

04:18.058 --> 04:19.458
I'll keep that in mind.

04:19.560 --> 04:20.726
Okay.

04:51.225 --> 04:52.124
James?

04:52.226 --> 04:53.259
Alison?

04:53.260 --> 04:54.594
Yeah. Hey.

04:54.595 --> 04:55.928
It's so great to meet you.

04:55.929 --> 04:57.263
Yeah, yeah.
You too.

04:57.264 --> 04:59.331
I hope your drive up was okay?

04:59.433 --> 05:00.767
Yeah, yeah,
a few bumps on the road,

05:00.768 --> 05:02.402
but about as smooth
as one could hope for.

05:02.403 --> 05:03.936
Good.

05:03.937 --> 05:05.237
Is your family with you?

05:06.407 --> 05:07.774
My family?

05:07.775 --> 05:11.810
Yeah. Your profile said
you had a wife and a kid...

05:11.912 --> 05:13.612
Oh...

05:15.082 --> 05:16.416
I'm sorry.

05:16.417 --> 05:17.283
I've been meaning
to update that for a few months.

05:17.284 --> 05:19.285
We...

05:19.286 --> 05:20.486
We separated a while back.

05:20.487 --> 05:22.187
Oh...

05:22.289 --> 05:23.155
I'm really sorry to hear that.

05:23.257 --> 05:24.624
No. No, no, no.

05:24.625 --> 05:27.460
You know what, it's been hard,
but we're still friends.

05:27.461 --> 05:29.361
Kid and all, so.

05:29.463 --> 05:30.763
Well, that's good.

05:30.764 --> 05:31.931
For the kid.

05:31.932 --> 05:33.031
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah.

05:33.133 --> 05:35.435
They're actually
back in Minneapolis.

05:35.436 --> 05:38.604
Lilly's gonna come out here
in a few weeks to... to visit.

05:38.605 --> 05:39.938
That's my daughter.

05:41.442 --> 05:43.609
If this is a problem,
I can go find a hotel...

05:43.610 --> 05:45.210
No! No, no, no, no.
Don't be silly.

05:45.312 --> 05:46.178
Honestly, it's great.

05:46.280 --> 05:47.513
Yeah?

05:47.514 --> 05:48.781
Yeah!
Okay.

05:48.782 --> 05:50.116
Well, let me...
Let me show you to the suite.

05:50.117 --> 05:51.617
Great.
Okay.

05:51.618 --> 05:56.022
You know, my ex, actually,
works in law, just like you.

05:56.023 --> 05:57.522
I saw it on your profile.

05:57.624 --> 05:58.624
Oh.

05:58.625 --> 06:00.225
What law firm does she work for?

06:00.327 --> 06:01.861
Uh, Mckenzie, Latner and Co.

06:01.862 --> 06:03.629
And you?

06:03.630 --> 06:04.930
It's a long story.

06:06.500 --> 06:08.201
Just down this way.

06:08.202 --> 06:09.401
Okay.

06:09.503 --> 06:11.137
So what brings you to town?

06:11.138 --> 06:14.406
Uh, well, I'm actually thinking
about investing

06:14.508 --> 06:16.008
in a local cryptocurrency start-up,

06:16.009 --> 06:17.343
so I came to check it out.

06:17.344 --> 06:18.744
Oh. That's interesting.

06:18.846 --> 06:19.979
Yeah.

06:19.980 --> 06:21.180
I sold my private
security company

06:21.181 --> 06:22.247
a couple of years ago.

06:22.349 --> 06:23.248
Now I spend most of my time

06:23.350 --> 06:24.684
just looking
for good investments.

06:24.685 --> 06:26.352
Sounds like you're pretty busy.

06:26.353 --> 06:27.419
Try to be.

06:27.521 --> 06:29.421
So this is it.

06:29.523 --> 06:30.656
Wow!

06:30.657 --> 06:31.657
This is a nice spot.

06:31.658 --> 06:34.394
Yeah, it's super cozy in here.

06:34.395 --> 06:37.230
Well, got a bedroom
down the hall

06:37.231 --> 06:39.165
and a second bedroom right here.

06:39.166 --> 06:40.666
And we've got the bathroom here.

06:40.667 --> 06:43.435
And I just left some towels
under the cabinet.

06:43.537 --> 06:44.704
Great.

06:44.705 --> 06:46.873
And the TV
is a little bit wonky, but...

06:46.874 --> 06:49.574
I'm gonna get a repairman
to come soon, so.

06:49.676 --> 06:50.710
Okay.

06:50.711 --> 06:52.444
Well, you know what,

06:52.546 --> 06:53.679
I can probably
take a look at it.

06:53.680 --> 06:55.181
I'm kind of
a tech-nerd/handyman myself.

06:55.182 --> 06:57.949
Oh, well, maybe you could fix
my sink upstairs, too.

06:59.052 --> 07:00.186
Yeah, sure thing.

07:00.187 --> 07:02.287
That was a joke, but okay.

07:02.389 --> 07:03.856
I'll try.

07:03.857 --> 07:06.392
Well, if you need anything,
you can just text me, or...

07:06.393 --> 07:07.860
I'm just right up the stairs.

07:07.861 --> 07:11.397
The door on the left
leads to my kitchen.

07:11.398 --> 07:13.933
And I left you a list

07:13.934 --> 07:16.435
of some of
my favorite restaurants in town,

07:16.537 --> 07:18.437
if ever you get hungry.

07:18.539 --> 07:19.539
That's awesome.

07:19.540 --> 07:20.980
Thank you so much.
I appreciate that.

07:22.242 --> 07:25.711
Well, this is my first time
being a Mi Casa Su Casa host,

07:25.712 --> 07:26.913
so if you like what you see,

07:26.914 --> 07:29.582
I would appreciate
you commenting

07:29.583 --> 07:31.751
on anything
you feel comfortable posting.

07:31.752 --> 07:32.919
Seems like a beautiful home,

07:32.920 --> 07:33.920
I'm sure you'll be
the perfect host.

07:33.921 --> 07:34.954
It would be my pleasure.

07:34.955 --> 07:37.056
Thanks.
Yeah.

07:37.057 --> 07:39.725
Great! Well, I'll leave
your keys right here...

07:39.726 --> 07:40.760
Awesome.

07:40.761 --> 07:41.961
...And I'll let you
get settled in.

07:41.962 --> 07:44.129
Okay. Thank you.
This is great.

07:44.231 --> 07:45.931
Goodnight.
Goodnight, Alison.

09:05.012 --> 09:05.978
Hey.

09:05.979 --> 09:07.813
Morning!

09:07.814 --> 09:09.882
You're making breakfast?

09:09.883 --> 09:12.351
Yeah. It's the best way
to start the day, right?

09:12.352 --> 09:13.853
Hannah, my ex, used to harass me

09:13.854 --> 09:15.388
if she ever found
a pound of fat on me,

09:15.389 --> 09:17.756
so I kind of got in the habit
of going for a run,

09:17.858 --> 09:19.524
and now I'm making us breakfast.

09:20.827 --> 09:21.861
Listen, James, I...

09:21.862 --> 09:23.362
Big Box Outlet?

09:23.363 --> 09:26.332
What's that?

09:26.333 --> 09:28.600
It's temporary.

09:28.702 --> 09:30.769
I lost my job
at the firm not too long ago,

09:30.871 --> 09:32.103
and so this is...

09:32.205 --> 09:33.673
Hey, you know what,
it's none of my business.

09:33.674 --> 09:35.174
I mean, I don't judge anyone

09:35.175 --> 09:36.909
for doing what they have to do
to put food on the table.

09:36.910 --> 09:38.010
In fact, you know what,

09:38.011 --> 09:39.245
maybe I could talk to Hannah

09:39.246 --> 09:40.745
about getting you
practicing again.

09:40.847 --> 09:41.881
I mean, her partners have

09:41.882 --> 09:44.383
satellite firms
all over the country.

09:44.384 --> 09:45.551
There might be a fit somewhere.

09:45.552 --> 09:47.619
You think
that she would do that?

09:47.721 --> 09:49.055
Yeah. Yeah.

09:49.056 --> 09:51.790
I mean, we might be separated,
but we're still civil.

09:51.892 --> 09:53.392
That's says a lot about someone

09:53.393 --> 09:56.962
who goes their separate ways
but can still be friends.

09:57.864 --> 09:59.065
I agree.

09:59.066 --> 10:00.399
Well, have a nice day.

10:00.400 --> 10:01.466
Yeah, you too.

10:14.247 --> 10:15.647
Hey, there she is!

10:15.749 --> 10:17.148
Just the ex-lawyer
I want to see.

10:17.250 --> 10:18.618
Brandon... hi.

10:18.619 --> 10:20.939
Come on into my office.
I want to run something by you.

10:28.729 --> 10:30.209
Why don't you grab a seat
right there?

10:35.902 --> 10:39.371
So I have got a little problem
that I wanted to run by you.

10:40.307 --> 10:41.641
The thing is,

10:41.642 --> 10:43.109
I can't afford
an actual law firm.

10:43.110 --> 10:44.143
I was kind of hoping

10:44.144 --> 10:46.177
that maybe I could
pick your brain.

10:47.447 --> 10:48.847
I'm listening.

10:49.950 --> 10:51.917
You know, this isn't really
the time or place

10:51.918 --> 10:53.319
to discuss it.

10:53.320 --> 10:55.687
Why don't you and I grab
a bite to eat later on tonight?

10:55.789 --> 10:56.855
My treat.

10:56.957 --> 10:58.824
And I'll fill you in
on the details.

10:58.825 --> 11:01.326
Mr. Matthews,
I appreciate you...

11:01.428 --> 11:05.196
Look, I will pay you
$150 for the hour.

11:06.133 --> 11:07.166
Come on.

11:07.167 --> 11:12.303
You get fed, you listen,
you go home.

11:13.440 --> 11:14.440
That's it?

11:14.441 --> 11:16.074
That's it.

11:16.977 --> 11:18.543
Look, Sarah told me

11:18.645 --> 11:21.514
that you're renting out
your basement suite right now.

11:21.515 --> 11:23.149
Sounds like you're
a little bit desperate...

11:23.150 --> 11:25.216
And the truth is...

11:25.318 --> 11:26.985
so am I.

11:29.690 --> 11:30.990
Fine.
Great.

11:30.991 --> 11:35.393
How about 8:00 P.M.
at The Fat Cow Oyster Bar?

11:37.297 --> 11:38.798
They've got everything there.

11:38.799 --> 11:40.398
And it's very central.

11:42.669 --> 11:44.736
Sure.

11:45.839 --> 11:47.472
8:00.
Great.

11:50.677 --> 11:52.177
Looking forward to it.

11:56.817 --> 11:58.818
You told him
about my rental suite?

11:58.819 --> 11:59.852
He was asking
about your situation,

11:59.853 --> 12:01.586
I didn't think
it was a big deal.

12:01.688 --> 12:02.655
I know.

12:02.656 --> 12:04.255
It's just, he's so...

12:04.357 --> 12:06.325
So what happened?
Did he ask you out?

12:06.326 --> 12:09.028
No, he just wanted to ask me
some legal stuff.

12:09.029 --> 12:10.563
He's going to pay me
for my time.

12:10.564 --> 12:12.565
Okay, well, just remember

12:12.566 --> 12:13.932
that being nice
to men like that...

12:14.034 --> 12:16.101
I know, I get it.

12:17.838 --> 12:18.904
Anyway, how'd it go
with the family?

12:18.905 --> 12:20.438
Well, actually,
it wasn't a family.

12:21.374 --> 12:22.374
Really?

12:22.375 --> 12:23.542
It was supposed to be,

12:23.543 --> 12:24.910
but they're going through
a separation.

12:24.911 --> 12:26.378
What, so no one showed up?

12:26.379 --> 12:27.513
No, the guy did.

12:27.514 --> 12:29.181
Just him?

12:29.182 --> 12:31.183
His kid is coming next week.

12:31.184 --> 12:34.854
And he's...

12:34.855 --> 12:36.087
Okay, please don't tell me

12:36.189 --> 12:37.556
he's the most gorgeous guy
you've ever seen.

12:37.557 --> 12:40.226
I was going to say he's nice,

12:40.227 --> 12:43.095
but if you like handsome,
charming,

12:43.096 --> 12:44.462
and in really great shape...

12:44.564 --> 12:45.765
I hate you.

12:45.766 --> 12:47.733
But...

12:47.734 --> 12:50.069
This morning,
when I came downstairs,

12:50.070 --> 12:52.203
he had cooked
a full healthy breakfast.

12:53.373 --> 12:55.541
Sounds like
a modern-day renaissance man.

12:55.542 --> 12:56.542
In <i> my</i> kitchen.

12:56.543 --> 12:57.543
So?

12:57.544 --> 12:59.779
That wasn't
part of the agreement.

12:59.780 --> 13:01.614
Oh, well, did he know that?

13:01.615 --> 13:03.549
It was on the website.
I think.

13:03.550 --> 13:04.849
So then you told him?

13:05.786 --> 13:07.119
I didn't have the heart
to tell him.

13:07.120 --> 13:10.289
He put so much effort
into the breakfast.

13:10.290 --> 13:12.057
Well, then just set
some boundaries.

13:12.058 --> 13:13.759
I mean,
I'm sure he'll understand.

13:13.760 --> 13:15.795
He has his space,
you have yours.

13:15.796 --> 13:16.929
Yeah...

13:16.930 --> 13:18.363
Alison?

13:20.767 --> 13:21.734
Michael?

13:21.735 --> 13:24.669
I thought that was you.

13:24.771 --> 13:26.071
I don't think I've seen you
since graduation.

13:26.072 --> 13:27.172
How have you been?

13:28.275 --> 13:30.943
Really great, obviously.

13:30.944 --> 13:34.479
I was upgraded to partner
of the gardening section.

13:34.581 --> 13:36.714
And I won a case in dairy, so...

13:38.118 --> 13:39.350
What about you?

13:39.452 --> 13:40.786
Didn't you move back to Orlando?

13:40.787 --> 13:43.822
I moved out here
just over six months ago.

13:43.924 --> 13:44.823
Crowder and Associates.

13:44.925 --> 13:46.458
Nice landing.

13:46.459 --> 13:47.927
Yeah, it's alright.

13:47.928 --> 13:49.527
Oh, sorry.

13:49.629 --> 13:51.529
Michael, this is Sarah.
Sarah, this is Michael.

13:51.631 --> 13:53.364
Michael and I went to Chase...

13:53.466 --> 13:55.301
And Sarah and I
have been best friends

13:55.302 --> 13:56.468
since elementary school.

13:56.469 --> 13:58.703
Sarah Williams.

13:58.805 --> 13:59.871
I actually remember

13:59.973 --> 14:00.806
Alison mentioning your name
back in the day.

14:00.807 --> 14:02.207
You remember that?

14:02.309 --> 14:03.642
I have a weird brain
for that sort of information.

14:03.643 --> 14:05.778
Impressive.

14:05.779 --> 14:07.313
You know what,
now that you mention it,

14:07.314 --> 14:08.447
I remember that about you...

14:08.448 --> 14:10.548
Hence why you were
at the top of our class.

14:10.650 --> 14:12.717
Didn't you get a 98%
in the debate final?

14:12.819 --> 14:14.385
I did.

14:14.487 --> 14:16.155
I remember that.
Excuse me, Miss.

14:16.156 --> 14:18.289
How can I help you?

14:20.994 --> 14:23.796
So, obviously, things didn't
work out at Fairfax?

14:23.797 --> 14:25.331
It's a long story,

14:25.332 --> 14:26.731
but the short of it is

14:26.833 --> 14:28.566
me and my ex
were splitting up, and...

14:28.668 --> 14:30.336
Edwin.

14:30.337 --> 14:31.337
Edwin, right...

14:31.338 --> 14:32.770
I really didn't like that guy.

14:33.640 --> 14:35.674
Well, a lot of people didn't,

14:35.675 --> 14:38.409
and apparently,
I was the last one to find out.

14:38.511 --> 14:39.511
Who is that?

14:41.348 --> 14:44.549
That's my boss, Mr. Matthews,

14:44.651 --> 14:46.885
or...

14:46.987 --> 14:48.487
"Brandon" as he would like me
to call him.

14:48.488 --> 14:50.489
Does he always
stare at you like that?

14:50.490 --> 14:52.524
That's alright.

14:52.525 --> 14:54.393
You know, if you're still
interested in practicing,

14:54.394 --> 14:55.861
the partners at my firm

14:55.862 --> 14:57.830
are actually looking for
some new associates right now.

14:57.831 --> 14:59.264
Seriously?

14:59.366 --> 15:01.199
Here, have a look at this.

15:03.169 --> 15:05.270
Crowder and Associates.

15:05.372 --> 15:06.505
Nice.

15:06.506 --> 15:07.906
Look, if and when you're ready,

15:08.008 --> 15:10.376
give me a call or email
me your C.V., okay?

15:10.377 --> 15:12.344
We'll set something up for you.

15:12.345 --> 15:14.012
You don't deserve this.

15:44.744 --> 15:45.878
That's so great, sweetie.

15:45.879 --> 15:47.612
I can't wait to see it.

15:47.714 --> 15:49.381
Okay.

15:49.382 --> 15:51.449
Yeah, I love you, too.

15:51.551 --> 15:53.419
Alright, put your mom
on the phone again, alright?

15:53.420 --> 15:55.320
Hey, Hannah.

15:55.422 --> 15:57.589
I know, it sounds like
she's doing really great.

15:57.590 --> 15:59.657
Lilly's gonna have
a great time, I think.

15:59.759 --> 16:01.627
Okay. Alright, bye.

16:01.628 --> 16:03.328
Hello?

16:03.430 --> 16:06.130
Sorry, I just got home
from work,

16:06.232 --> 16:08.600
and I saw
that you used my kitchen.

16:08.601 --> 16:09.601
Yeah, yeah.

16:09.602 --> 16:11.002
I hope you don't mind,

16:11.104 --> 16:12.571
I just thought I'd make
something healthy for dinner,

16:12.572 --> 16:15.140
and then I was wondering
if maybe you wanted to join.

16:15.141 --> 16:17.976
I was going to mention
that I'd rather...

16:18.078 --> 16:19.410
Hey.
Hi.

16:21.414 --> 16:24.816
I was gonna say
that I didn't intend

16:24.918 --> 16:29.321
on my kitchen being used
by the downstairs tenants...

16:29.322 --> 16:30.855
Oh...

16:30.957 --> 16:31.991
It wasn't even clear
on the site,

16:31.992 --> 16:33.625
so it's my fault.

16:33.626 --> 16:34.827
When you said to knock

16:34.828 --> 16:35.828
and that you were just upstairs,

16:35.829 --> 16:36.829
I thought that...

16:36.830 --> 16:37.996
It's all good.

16:38.098 --> 16:39.197
Yeah.

16:39.299 --> 16:40.799
Sorry. It was
a total misunderstanding.

16:40.800 --> 16:41.934
Now I know.

16:41.935 --> 16:42.935
It won't happen again.

16:42.936 --> 16:44.235
I appreciate that.

16:45.438 --> 16:48.440
I did actually, um,
fix your sink, though,

16:48.441 --> 16:50.041
while I was up here.

16:50.143 --> 16:51.276
You did?

16:51.277 --> 16:53.111
Yeah. May I?

16:54.314 --> 16:55.713
Yeah. Of course.

16:57.617 --> 16:59.985
Yeah, it was just
a little blockage,

16:59.986 --> 17:02.086
but it should be gone now.

17:03.456 --> 17:04.455
Ta-dah!

17:04.457 --> 17:06.458
Okay, now I just feel bad.

17:06.459 --> 17:07.960
No, no, no, don't...

17:07.961 --> 17:09.994
No, seriously, I should
be paying <i> you to</i> stay here.

17:09.996 --> 17:13.132
Well, maybe just
join me for some dinner.

17:13.133 --> 17:14.165
You hungry?

17:16.636 --> 17:17.902
I wish I could.

17:18.003 --> 17:19.538
I actually have plans.

17:19.539 --> 17:21.507
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, of course.

17:21.508 --> 17:23.074
It's my boss.

17:23.175 --> 17:25.010
It's the last thing
I would want to be doing.

17:25.011 --> 17:26.178
Well, work comes first.

17:26.179 --> 17:28.480
You know what, I'll just...
I'll clear this up.

17:28.481 --> 17:30.248
I'll be out of your hair.

17:30.350 --> 17:32.684
Hey, why don't you eat up here?

17:32.685 --> 17:34.720
You already
went through all the trouble.

17:34.721 --> 17:36.388
Well, I appreciate that,

17:36.389 --> 17:38.323
but it might be kind of weird
just being in your house,

17:38.324 --> 17:39.324
eating alone.

17:40.527 --> 17:42.227
Well, I do it all the time.

17:42.228 --> 17:44.395
Right.

17:44.497 --> 17:45.563
I'm gonna go get ready

17:45.665 --> 17:47.331
for this thing
I really don't want to do.

17:49.235 --> 17:50.903
I'm sorry that I can't join you
for dinner.

17:50.904 --> 17:52.703
No, no. Another night.
Okay.

18:31.811 --> 18:32.544
<i>You're gonna I</i>

18:32.545 --> 18:35.046
Oh, just water for me, thanks.

18:36.583 --> 18:39.050
Well, more for me, I guess.

18:41.087 --> 18:43.589
So what did you want
to talk to me about?

18:43.590 --> 18:45.691
What, no foreplay?

18:45.692 --> 18:47.726
Excuse me?

18:47.727 --> 18:48.927
I just thought that rapport

18:48.928 --> 18:50.294
was a necessary step

18:50.430 --> 18:51.763
in the attorney-client
relationship.

18:51.764 --> 18:53.998
Well, I'm not your attorney.

18:55.268 --> 18:56.902
No, but you are my employee,

18:56.903 --> 18:58.836
and someone
I'd like to get to know better,

18:58.938 --> 19:01.506
so a modicum
of mutual socializing

19:01.608 --> 19:03.307
isn't too much to ask,
now, is it?

19:04.777 --> 19:05.810
Look...

19:05.945 --> 19:08.614
I want to be
perfectly frank with you.

19:08.615 --> 19:11.083
I think...

19:11.084 --> 19:14.852
that you and I...

19:14.954 --> 19:17.623
would make a perfect team...

19:17.624 --> 19:19.790
which is why
I want to make a proposal.

19:20.927 --> 19:22.793
Assistant Manager.

19:25.098 --> 19:26.565
What about Sarah?

19:26.566 --> 19:28.967
Sarah doesn't have the brains.

19:28.968 --> 19:30.468
I see the way
you handle yourself.

19:32.138 --> 19:33.572
The way you interact
with customers.

19:33.573 --> 19:35.474
I see a lot.

19:35.475 --> 19:37.675
But you can't...

19:37.810 --> 19:39.244
Sarah's been there for years.

19:39.245 --> 19:40.979
She practically runs the place.

19:40.980 --> 19:43.181
She's way past
her best-before date.

19:44.651 --> 19:46.151
Which is why I wanted to get
your legal advice

19:46.152 --> 19:48.819
on how I can get you
to take her place, hmm?

19:51.991 --> 19:54.525
That would be
a conflict of interest.

19:54.661 --> 19:55.627
Well, would it change things

19:55.628 --> 19:57.895
if I told you
that there'd be a raise?

19:57.997 --> 20:00.165
Maybe a bump in commissions?

20:00.166 --> 20:02.200
Not to mention...

20:02.335 --> 20:03.335
other perks.

20:07.006 --> 20:08.673
I'd make it
all worth your while.

20:11.978 --> 20:12.978
What are you doing?

20:13.980 --> 20:15.179
Don't make a scene.

20:16.816 --> 20:18.749
You realize
that this is harassment?

20:18.851 --> 20:20.484
Come on.

20:21.354 --> 20:23.087
Don't pull that card.

20:23.189 --> 20:24.355
Alison!

20:28.695 --> 20:30.529
Alison, what's the problem?

20:30.530 --> 20:31.596
Just leave me alone!

20:31.698 --> 20:32.864
You've done enough tonight!

20:32.865 --> 20:33.999
You're overreacting.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
Overreacting?

20:35.001 --> 20:36.468
You grabbed me!

20:36.469 --> 20:37.569
I barely touched you.
Come on.

20:37.570 --> 20:38.870
Hey!

20:38.871 --> 20:40.539
Hey, why don't you mind
your own business, buddy?

20:40.540 --> 20:42.240
I think the lady

20:42.342 --> 20:45.043
would like for you
to leave her alone...

20:45.044 --> 20:46.711
buddy.

20:49.716 --> 20:51.048
You've got this all wrong.

20:58.057 --> 20:59.790
So that's your boss, huh?

20:59.892 --> 21:00.826
Yeah.

21:00.827 --> 21:02.593
What are you doing here?

21:02.695 --> 21:03.928
I was gonna eat at home,

21:04.030 --> 21:05.197
but then I just figured
we'd save it for tomorrow,

21:05.198 --> 21:07.666
so I came to get some Chinese.

21:07.667 --> 21:08.733
Are you sure you're okay?

21:09.869 --> 21:10.902
Yeah.

21:10.903 --> 21:12.270
Look, why don't you get home,

21:12.372 --> 21:14.239
I'll pick something up,
I'll bring it back for us.

21:14.240 --> 21:16.742
That's really sweet,

21:16.743 --> 21:19.077
but I think I'm just
gonna go home,

21:19.078 --> 21:20.778
and go to bed early.

21:20.913 --> 21:22.413
Yeah. Okay.

21:23.783 --> 21:25.616
Thanks for helping me.
Yeah.

21:28.254 --> 21:29.287
Good night.
'Night.

21:47.607 --> 21:48.806
Hey.

21:48.941 --> 21:50.275
<i>Hey.
Sorry I missed your call.</i>

21:50.276 --> 21:52.077
<i>Everything okay?</i>

21:52.078 --> 21:53.477
You were right.

21:53.579 --> 21:55.012
About Brandon.

21:55.114 --> 21:57.616
<i>Oh, no.
What did he do?</i>

21:57.617 --> 21:59.817
He just...

21:59.919 --> 22:02.454
I can't believe
he made a move on me like that.

22:02.455 --> 22:03.789
<i>Ali...</i>

22:03.790 --> 22:04.790
I don't know why

22:04.791 --> 22:06.824
I keep attracting

22:06.959 --> 22:08.560
these kinds of people
into my life, you know?

22:08.561 --> 22:09.694
Maybe it's me.

22:09.796 --> 22:10.962
<i>No, no!</i>

22:10.963 --> 22:12.798
<i>It's not you.
Don't even go there.</i>

22:12.799 --> 22:14.365
<i>Men like him are a dying breed.</i>

22:14.467 --> 22:15.467
I just don't know

22:15.601 --> 22:17.769
how I'm going
to face him tomorrow.

22:17.770 --> 22:18.970
<i>Hey, listen,</i>

22:18.971 --> 22:20.605
<i>if you want to
take this up with H.R.,</i>

22:20.606 --> 22:22.139
<i>you know I'll back you up.</i>

22:23.076 --> 22:24.309
<i>Brandon's been
getting away with this</i>

22:24.310 --> 22:25.944
<i>for far too long.</i>

22:25.945 --> 22:27.345
<i>In my opinion,</i>

22:27.447 --> 22:29.815
<i>he's run into the wrong person
in the wrong era.</i>

22:29.816 --> 22:31.616
I know.

22:31.617 --> 22:33.217
Look, I'm just gonna
get some sleep,

22:33.319 --> 22:35.987
and I will see you tomorrow.

22:35.988 --> 22:37.388
<i>Okay.
Bright and early.</i>

22:37.490 --> 22:38.689
<i>Bye.</i>

22:39.659 --> 22:41.859
Okay. Bye.

22:47.367 --> 22:48.900
Good morning.
Hi.

22:48.901 --> 22:50.035
None for me?

22:50.036 --> 22:52.303
James got it for me.

22:52.405 --> 22:53.872
Ooh! Breakfast in bed now?

22:53.873 --> 22:55.207
Stop it.

22:55.208 --> 22:56.241
Maybe I should rent out
my basement...

22:56.242 --> 22:57.608
I don't have a basement.

22:57.710 --> 22:59.244
I have a living room.
I could rent out my living room.

22:59.245 --> 23:00.278
Very funny.

23:00.279 --> 23:03.114
Oh! And his wife...

23:03.216 --> 23:04.750
Well, ex-wife...

23:04.751 --> 23:05.884
Is a lawyer,

23:05.885 --> 23:07.685
and she said
she'd look over my resume.

23:09.422 --> 23:11.623
Two contacts in two days.

23:11.624 --> 23:13.558
Not too shabby...

23:13.559 --> 23:15.626
Hey...

23:15.728 --> 23:17.896
You know I appreciate you
getting me this job, right?

23:17.897 --> 23:19.898
Of course.

23:19.899 --> 23:20.932
And we all know
you're over-qualified.

23:20.933 --> 23:22.601
Probably going to be
a long process,

23:22.602 --> 23:24.236
and I'm not really sure...

23:24.237 --> 23:25.536
Excuse me, Alison.

23:26.572 --> 23:28.212
Could I speak to you
for a minute, please?

23:30.443 --> 23:31.910
Good morning, folks.
Welcome to the store.

23:31.911 --> 23:33.951
Don't forget to check out
all of our great specials.

23:38.117 --> 23:40.085
Listen, Alison...

23:40.086 --> 23:41.352
Mr. Matthews, I...

23:41.454 --> 23:42.487
Please. Let me just finish.

23:42.488 --> 23:44.021
Okay?

23:44.123 --> 23:45.424
From what I recall,

23:45.425 --> 23:48.160
all I did last night
was ask you for a little help

23:48.161 --> 23:49.161
with a personal matter,

23:49.162 --> 23:50.361
and if you think

23:50.463 --> 23:53.197
that you can accuse me
of anything untoward,

23:53.299 --> 23:54.666
well...

23:54.667 --> 23:56.268
it's not going to work out
for you here.

23:56.269 --> 23:57.602
Mr. Matthews...

23:57.603 --> 23:59.838
Brandon...

23:59.839 --> 24:01.339
I really need this job,

24:01.340 --> 24:02.774
and...

24:02.775 --> 24:06.977
I apologize if I overreacted.

24:09.015 --> 24:10.314
Good.

24:11.150 --> 24:12.616
I was hoping you'd say that.

25:17.884 --> 25:19.917
Hey!
Hey.

25:20.019 --> 25:22.721
You never told me
you had a green thumb.

25:22.722 --> 25:25.190
Yeah. Yeah.

25:25.191 --> 25:26.591
I hope you don't mind.
No, I...

25:26.592 --> 25:28.527
In fact, that's not something
I would do for myself,

25:28.528 --> 25:29.426
so thank you.

25:29.529 --> 25:31.062
Well, I have to admit,

25:31.063 --> 25:33.264
I saw on your profile
that you loved petunias, so...

25:33.366 --> 25:35.266
You saw that?

25:35.368 --> 25:37.601
Yeah. It was listed under
favorite things,

25:37.703 --> 25:39.070
which is funny,

25:39.071 --> 25:40.739
because I kind of had you pegged
as more of a tulip girl.

25:40.740 --> 25:43.074
That's what you get for
putting all your things online.

25:43.075 --> 25:43.974
Right.

25:44.076 --> 25:46.010
Oh, excuse me.

25:47.780 --> 25:49.079
Hello?

25:50.249 --> 25:51.216
Michael?

25:51.217 --> 25:52.917
You found my number.

25:55.221 --> 25:57.088
Really?

25:57.089 --> 25:59.291
They want to interview me?

25:59.292 --> 26:00.424
That's amazing.

26:01.594 --> 26:04.094
Yeah, I can go for a snack.

26:05.932 --> 26:07.831
The Friendly Bistro, 7:00.

26:07.934 --> 26:09.300
I'll see you then.

26:09.402 --> 26:10.936
Bye.

26:10.937 --> 26:12.103
Who was that?

26:12.104 --> 26:14.838
That's an old
law-school friend of mine.

26:14.941 --> 26:16.608
I guess his firm
wants to interview me.

26:16.609 --> 26:17.609
That's great, right?

26:17.610 --> 26:18.610
Yeah...

26:18.611 --> 26:20.245
What?

26:20.246 --> 26:22.948
It's just...

26:22.949 --> 26:24.416
I don't know.

26:24.417 --> 26:25.750
He's one of those people

26:25.751 --> 26:28.453
who's, like, really pleased
to see me, you know?

26:28.454 --> 26:29.853
Ah...

26:29.956 --> 26:31.089
Well, do you want me
to come with?

26:31.090 --> 26:33.325
I could sit in the corner,
put on a disguise,

26:33.326 --> 26:34.593
choke him if he tries
any funny business.

26:34.594 --> 26:36.294
I think we'll be fine.
Okay.

26:36.295 --> 26:37.929
Um...

26:37.930 --> 26:39.497
do you mind if I grab a glass
of water from your kitchen?

26:39.498 --> 26:41.098
No. Come on in.

26:42.301 --> 26:43.635
You think you guys will be
having a late night tonight?

26:43.636 --> 26:47.905
No. It's just to get an update
about this potential interview.

26:49.809 --> 26:51.142
That's cool.
Here you go.

26:51.143 --> 26:52.277
Thank you.
You're welcome.

26:52.278 --> 26:53.877
I'm just going to go change.
Yeah.

26:55.147 --> 26:57.014
Hey, how did it go
with your boss today?

26:57.116 --> 26:59.017
He said I overreacted,

26:59.018 --> 27:01.051
which is why
I need this interview.

27:04.156 --> 27:05.456
And I need it badly.

27:25.144 --> 27:26.243
Okay...

27:31.517 --> 27:33.551
Wow.

27:33.552 --> 27:35.353
You sure it's not a date?

27:35.354 --> 27:36.554
Trust me.

27:36.555 --> 27:38.122
I just want
to look professional.

27:40.359 --> 27:41.192
So what are you going
to be doing?

27:41.193 --> 27:43.161
I'm just going to...

27:43.162 --> 27:45.063
finish up back here,
shoot off some work emails.

27:45.064 --> 27:46.031
Nothing major.

27:46.032 --> 27:48.098
I wish I could stay in.

27:48.200 --> 27:50.067
This sounds like
a great opportunity for you.

27:50.169 --> 27:51.869
Yeah. Thanks.

27:53.039 --> 27:54.072
I love the flowers.

27:54.073 --> 27:55.773
You're welcome.

27:55.875 --> 27:57.608
And thank you for the water.

27:57.710 --> 27:58.976
Anytime.

27:59.912 --> 28:01.045
See you later.
See ya.

28:38.250 --> 28:39.584
You remember
those all-night study sessions

28:39.585 --> 28:41.619
at Calhoun's Cafe in Kentucky?

28:41.620 --> 28:43.487
Strongest coffee in town.

28:43.589 --> 28:44.889
I never drank it.

28:44.890 --> 28:47.292
You never drank the coffee?
How did you stay up?

28:47.293 --> 28:49.794
I don't know.
I just never really needed it.

28:49.795 --> 28:51.429
But I do remember

28:51.430 --> 28:52.996
Edwin trying to pick you up
one night.

28:53.099 --> 28:55.734
You were sitting
over there in the corner,

28:55.735 --> 28:57.402
and he walked right in,

28:57.403 --> 28:58.937
looking like a lost little kid
in a land full of lawyers.

28:58.938 --> 29:01.038
Well, he always hated lawyers.

29:02.074 --> 29:03.340
And Kentucky.

29:04.443 --> 29:05.777
Should've taken that hint,
I guess.

29:05.778 --> 29:08.178
Well, he obviously
didn't want to lose you.

29:08.280 --> 29:09.179
I mean, I can't blame him.

29:09.281 --> 29:10.949
What do you mean?

29:10.950 --> 29:13.183
Well, I had a little crush
on you back in the day.

29:13.285 --> 29:14.985
You did?

29:15.087 --> 29:16.287
Everybody did.

29:16.288 --> 29:18.656
But I went my own way.

29:18.657 --> 29:19.890
Out of respect, of course.

29:21.961 --> 29:23.360
Speaking of which,

29:23.462 --> 29:24.828
is your boss
still creeping on you

29:24.930 --> 29:25.964
from his window?

29:25.965 --> 29:27.097
Uh, yeah.

29:28.634 --> 29:31.034
I'm hoping
not for much longer, though.

29:31.137 --> 29:33.203
Well, actually,
I spoke to my associates.

29:33.305 --> 29:34.472
You did?

29:34.473 --> 29:35.974
Mm-hmm.

29:35.975 --> 29:37.776
I told them about your grades
and your Bar exam,

29:37.777 --> 29:39.277
and they're very impressed.

29:39.278 --> 29:40.979
And they want to see
your full C.V.,

29:40.980 --> 29:42.546
which you can bring
to your interview!

29:42.648 --> 29:45.316
Sorry. Sorry.

29:45.317 --> 29:46.818
Don't be.

29:46.819 --> 29:50.622
It's just been such a while
since I got some good news.

29:50.623 --> 29:52.389
Don't worry about it.
Cheers to that.

29:52.491 --> 29:53.791
Yes.

30:20.653 --> 30:22.352
<i>They'll call you
by the end of the week,</i>

30:22.454 --> 30:23.955
so don't stress.

30:23.956 --> 30:25.122
Just be yourself.

30:26.158 --> 30:28.326
Let me send you
their contact info

30:28.327 --> 30:29.661
so you'll know it's them
when they call.

30:29.662 --> 30:31.128
That is old school.

30:31.964 --> 30:33.298
Keeps it simple.

30:33.299 --> 30:35.339
If I wanna check the weather,
I'll open a newspaper.

30:36.836 --> 30:37.836
Oh.

30:37.837 --> 30:39.703
Well, thanks again, Michael.

30:39.805 --> 30:41.172
It was so great
running into you again.

30:41.173 --> 30:42.906
Some things
are just meant to be.

30:43.008 --> 30:44.875
Right.

30:44.977 --> 30:47.878
Okay, well,
I should probably get home.

30:47.980 --> 30:49.347
Yeah, it is getting late.

30:49.348 --> 30:50.581
I want to make sure

30:50.683 --> 30:52.483
I'm sharp for
all those canned goods tomorrow.

30:53.686 --> 30:54.686
Bye.
Bye now.

32:29.448 --> 32:30.448
James?

32:32.785 --> 32:33.984
Just a sec.

32:38.424 --> 32:39.457
Hey.

32:39.458 --> 32:40.491
Guess who got a job interview?

32:40.492 --> 32:42.093
What?
That's fantastic!

32:42.094 --> 32:43.360
Not only that,

32:43.462 --> 32:45.862
but I don't have
much to celebrate these days,

32:45.965 --> 32:47.999
so I brought over
a bottle of wine.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.232
Do you feel like hosting?

32:51.270 --> 32:53.438
Mi Casa Su Casa.
Literally. Come on.

32:53.439 --> 32:54.571
Awesome.
Thank you.

32:56.475 --> 32:58.643
You know, I used to live
down here for a while.

32:58.644 --> 32:59.777
Yeah. I kind of figured

32:59.778 --> 33:01.179
it was your family home
or something.

33:01.180 --> 33:03.714
Most people can't afford
a house like this these days.

33:03.816 --> 33:05.256
Well, not on
a one-year law career.

33:05.985 --> 33:06.850
Right.

33:06.986 --> 33:09.153
So, when my dad died,

33:09.154 --> 33:10.687
my mom just needed a change,

33:10.789 --> 33:13.458
and so she moved to
Sedona, of all places.

33:13.459 --> 33:15.692
Ah... Home of the vortexes.

33:15.828 --> 33:17.194
You know your stuff.

33:17.329 --> 33:19.696
It's the spiritual center
of the United States.

33:19.798 --> 33:20.697
I mean, the Hopi people

33:20.799 --> 33:22.433
still have a lot
to teach us about

33:22.434 --> 33:23.868
peace and love...

33:23.869 --> 33:25.135
If we're willing to learn.

33:26.472 --> 33:27.938
Have you ever been there?

33:29.174 --> 33:31.014
It's actually
where Hannah and I got married.

33:33.812 --> 33:36.981
I have to admit,
I heard you guys talking.

33:36.982 --> 33:39.082
You heard?

33:39.184 --> 33:40.951
Yeah. It's an old house.
Thin walls.

33:42.321 --> 33:43.720
I don't mean to pry, but...

33:43.856 --> 33:46.524
I think it's really great
that you two are friends.

33:46.525 --> 33:49.360
I know how hard breakups can be.

33:49.361 --> 33:50.761
Yeah, I mean, the truth is,

33:50.863 --> 33:56.868
we hadn't been on the same page
for a long, long time.

33:56.869 --> 33:59.403
Even intimately...

33:59.505 --> 34:01.438
it's been years.

34:01.540 --> 34:02.540
Years?

34:02.541 --> 34:04.342
Sorry. Is that
too much information?

34:04.343 --> 34:05.709
No, no, not at all.

34:07.379 --> 34:09.847
In fact, it's refreshing

34:09.848 --> 34:12.949
to know that
I'm not the only one who has...

34:13.052 --> 34:13.917
struggles.

34:14.018 --> 34:16.219
You and your ex?
Yeah.

34:17.688 --> 34:19.389
We were...

34:19.391 --> 34:20.924
a bad match.

34:21.927 --> 34:22.927
How so?

34:24.063 --> 34:25.897
He was possessive

34:25.898 --> 34:29.331
and jealous of my friends
and colleagues.

34:31.536 --> 34:32.902
That can be a lot to deal with.

34:35.107 --> 34:36.773
Did he hurt you?

34:40.913 --> 34:42.411
Well, if that's
all in the past...

34:44.049 --> 34:45.216
I mean, frankly,

34:45.217 --> 34:47.117
he's just lucky
I wasn't there to protect you.

34:49.054 --> 34:51.420
Not many men would have done
what you did last night.

34:53.257 --> 34:56.193
Put yourself in harm's way
to help.

34:58.597 --> 35:00.130
I guess I'm not like most men.

35:02.601 --> 35:03.734
No...

35:03.735 --> 35:04.768
you definitely aren't.

35:13.612 --> 35:15.079
I'm sorry.
What? No, no.

35:15.080 --> 35:16.447
I should not have done that.

35:16.448 --> 35:17.482
It's okay.

35:17.483 --> 35:18.515
No, I'm your landlord,

35:18.617 --> 35:19.917
and I should just
go back upstairs.

35:19.918 --> 35:20.918
Alison, just wait.

35:20.919 --> 35:22.120
Okay, look, this is your space,

35:22.121 --> 35:23.820
and if anything,
I misread the situation.

35:23.922 --> 35:26.623
No. You didn't.

35:30.395 --> 35:32.729
I don't think they cover this
in the Tenancy Act.

35:34.133 --> 35:36.066
Look, I used your kitchen...

35:36.969 --> 35:38.970
and you kissed me, so...

35:38.971 --> 35:40.070
let's just call it even.

35:41.807 --> 35:43.141
You're not weirded out?

35:43.142 --> 35:45.876
No, no.
Not at all.

35:45.978 --> 35:48.746
Look, whatever happened,
happened...

35:48.747 --> 35:50.413
and we're totally cool.

35:51.316 --> 35:52.350
We're cool?

35:52.351 --> 35:54.084
Totally cool.

35:58.290 --> 35:59.290
So how's your tenant?

35:59.291 --> 36:01.459
James?

36:01.460 --> 36:02.827
He's...

36:02.828 --> 36:03.860
good.

36:03.962 --> 36:06.096
What does <i> that</i> mean?

36:08.133 --> 36:10.134
Did something happen
between you two?

36:10.135 --> 36:11.335
We kissed.

36:11.336 --> 36:12.369
What?

36:12.471 --> 36:13.670
Shh!
Ali!

36:14.606 --> 36:15.940
How did that even happen?

36:15.941 --> 36:17.108
We were on the couch,

36:17.109 --> 36:18.109
and we were talking,

36:18.110 --> 36:19.643
and then
one thing led to another...

36:20.779 --> 36:21.678
I feel terrible!

36:21.780 --> 36:22.947
Why, why, why?

36:22.948 --> 36:24.448
Because he's my tenant.

36:24.449 --> 36:27.217
So, people meet on the Internet
all the time, I guess.

36:27.319 --> 36:28.519
I guess.

36:28.520 --> 36:30.053
Just be careful.

36:30.155 --> 36:31.155
What do you mean?

36:31.156 --> 36:32.290
Well, personally,

36:32.291 --> 36:34.191
I'm very happy
to see you moving on

36:34.326 --> 36:35.593
and feeling good
about yourself...

36:35.594 --> 36:38.129
Just... you know, don't...

36:38.130 --> 36:39.563
Move too fast.

36:39.665 --> 36:40.530
Exactly.

36:40.632 --> 36:41.632
Yeah.

36:42.868 --> 36:44.868
Okay, now I really
have to meet this guy.

39:00.972 --> 39:03.873
Uh, Ali?

39:03.975 --> 39:06.110
This is Detective Fitzgerald
and Detective Reynolds.

39:06.111 --> 39:08.112
They're hoping
to have a word with you.

39:08.113 --> 39:09.412
What's going on?

39:10.816 --> 39:11.649
When was the last time

39:11.650 --> 39:12.616
you saw Mr. Matthews?

39:12.617 --> 39:14.718
Uh, yesterday.

39:14.820 --> 39:16.954
We had a bit of an argument.

39:16.955 --> 39:19.590
About what?

39:19.591 --> 39:22.993
I was a lawyer.

39:22.994 --> 39:25.028
He asked me to help him
with a personal problem.

39:25.964 --> 39:26.964
I said I couldn't.

39:26.965 --> 39:30.533
Was he in some kind of trouble?

39:30.635 --> 39:32.202
Not that I'm aware of.

39:33.638 --> 39:36.406
What is going on?
Did he do something?

39:36.508 --> 39:38.809
What happened
after the argument?

39:38.810 --> 39:40.543
I finished my shift,

39:40.679 --> 39:42.313
I went home,

39:42.314 --> 39:45.715
and then I met up
with a friend for a drink...

39:45.851 --> 39:46.851
From back in college.

39:47.819 --> 39:48.718
He have a name?

39:48.820 --> 39:51.788
Michael Hammond.

39:52.691 --> 39:54.191
He'll vouch
for your whereabouts?

39:54.192 --> 39:55.658
Yes, of course.

39:57.028 --> 39:58.829
What is going on?

39:58.830 --> 40:02.032
Brandon Matthews
was killed last night.

40:02.033 --> 40:03.366
He was burned alive.

40:06.338 --> 40:08.605
How was your relationship
with him?

40:08.707 --> 40:11.107
He...

40:11.209 --> 40:12.642
he was my boss.

40:14.212 --> 40:18.581
Did your relationship ever
venture into any other areas?

40:19.651 --> 40:20.784
No.

40:20.886 --> 40:22.219
Nothing sexual

40:22.220 --> 40:24.221
or something that could be
misconstrued as such?

40:24.222 --> 40:26.189
Why are you asking me this?

40:27.225 --> 40:28.192
Miss Peters,

40:28.193 --> 40:29.393
Mr. Matthews' phone

40:29.394 --> 40:31.528
was retrieved
from the fire last night.

40:32.564 --> 40:33.397
Our forensics

40:33.398 --> 40:34.964
were able to pull the records.

40:35.066 --> 40:36.901
They show texts of you
communicating with him

40:36.902 --> 40:38.382
right up until
the time of his murder.

40:39.404 --> 40:40.537
What?

40:42.407 --> 40:44.208
"Hey, it's Alison.
Wanna try again?

40:44.209 --> 40:45.809
"Grab a drink tonight and talk?

40:45.911 --> 40:47.044
I promise to not overreact."

40:47.045 --> 40:48.913
Then, "I knew you'd be
a team player.

40:48.914 --> 40:50.114
Where do you want to meet me?"

40:51.082 --> 40:52.716
"Same place.
15 minutes."

40:52.717 --> 40:53.918
Then "Done."

40:53.919 --> 40:56.086
I didn't write that!

40:56.087 --> 40:58.288
Are you still 555-0199?

40:58.390 --> 40:59.456
No.

40:59.591 --> 41:00.723
That is not my number.

41:02.260 --> 41:03.860
It isn't?
No.

41:12.904 --> 41:14.071
Is there anyone in your life

41:14.072 --> 41:16.840
who might want to harm
Mr. Matthews?

41:16.942 --> 41:20.076
Maybe someone who wants
to get close to you?

41:22.314 --> 41:23.447
<i>Is your boss
still creeping on you</i>

41:23.448 --> 41:24.481
from his window?

41:26.284 --> 41:27.952
<i>He shouldn't do that to you.</i>

41:27.953 --> 41:29.652
<i>You don't deserve this.</i>

41:29.754 --> 41:31.034
<i>Alison?</i>

41:32.123 --> 41:33.423
What is it?

41:35.794 --> 41:37.728
Well...

41:37.729 --> 41:38.796
Michael was...

41:38.797 --> 41:41.664
What?
Michael was what?

41:43.134 --> 41:44.367
He saw...

41:44.469 --> 41:47.104
He saw Brandon staring at me

41:47.105 --> 41:48.439
and he said a comment

41:48.440 --> 41:50.007
that I didn't
pay much attention to

41:50.008 --> 41:51.074
at the time...

41:53.478 --> 41:55.479
And then he called me
out of the blue that night,

41:55.480 --> 41:58.848
and asked me to go
for dinner with him...

42:02.988 --> 42:05.289
And then he admitted
that he had a crush on me

42:05.290 --> 42:06.991
since we were in school.

42:06.992 --> 42:08.459
Listen...

42:08.460 --> 42:10.961
I'll check him out.

42:10.962 --> 42:13.730
In the meantime, just...

42:13.832 --> 42:16.199
you need to stay safe, okay?

42:16.301 --> 42:19.369
Whatever precautions
you need to take...

42:19.471 --> 42:20.971
do it.

42:20.972 --> 42:22.872
We're just a phone call away.

42:27.546 --> 42:29.680
Alison?

42:29.681 --> 42:32.216
Is everything okay?

42:32.217 --> 42:33.283
Hey. You okay?

42:34.419 --> 42:35.485
So what happened?

42:37.756 --> 42:38.722
He was murdered.

42:38.723 --> 42:40.591
What? Who?

42:40.592 --> 42:42.426
My boss.

42:42.427 --> 42:43.259
The guy from the restaurant?

42:43.361 --> 42:45.128
Yeah.

42:45.263 --> 42:46.564
Do they have a suspect?

42:46.565 --> 42:49.266
They don't know yet, but...

42:52.270 --> 42:53.503
Are you expecting someone?

42:54.406 --> 42:55.638
Yeah.

43:00.946 --> 43:02.178
Hey.

43:08.219 --> 43:10.453
I just had to leave
after they talked to me.

43:11.456 --> 43:13.791
Are you okay?
No.

43:13.792 --> 43:15.124
No, I'm not.

43:16.962 --> 43:20.130
Sarah, this is James.
James, this is Sarah.

43:20.131 --> 43:21.432
Hi.
Hey.

43:21.433 --> 43:23.100
I'm really sorry
to hear about your boss.

43:23.101 --> 43:24.134
Yeah, thanks.

43:24.135 --> 43:26.136
Did they question you, too?

43:26.137 --> 43:27.177
They questioned everybody.

43:28.473 --> 43:29.940
I'll get that.

43:29.941 --> 43:31.575
Do you guys want tea?

43:31.576 --> 43:33.042
Yeah. Thanks, James.
Yeah.

43:36.481 --> 43:40.516
So did they tell you
that someone texted Brandon

43:40.652 --> 43:41.986
and they tried to pin it on me?

43:41.987 --> 43:43.486
What?

43:43.588 --> 43:44.989
Yeah.

43:44.990 --> 43:46.490
From your phone?

43:46.491 --> 43:48.024
It was another phone number,

43:48.159 --> 43:50.059
but they still haven't found
the phone.

43:51.262 --> 43:53.262
So someone's trying
to put this on you?

43:55.667 --> 43:56.933
Okay, that's just freaky.

43:59.270 --> 44:00.337
It's Michael's firm.

44:00.338 --> 44:01.871
Put it on speaker phone.

44:05.010 --> 44:06.075
Hello?

44:06.177 --> 44:07.444
<i>Miss Peters,</i>

44:07.445 --> 44:10.648
<i>I'm calling on behalf of
Crowder and Associates.</i>

44:10.649 --> 44:12.048
Hi.

44:12.183 --> 44:13.350
<i>Mr. Crowder would like
to see you for an interview.</i>

44:13.351 --> 44:15.619
<i>Does 2:00 P.M.
tomorrow work for you?</i>

44:15.620 --> 44:17.988
Uh... yes.

44:17.989 --> 44:19.055
That's perfect.

44:19.190 --> 44:20.824
<i>Wonderful.
We'll see you then.</i>

44:20.825 --> 44:22.359
Okay, bye.

44:22.360 --> 44:23.627
What are you doing?

44:23.628 --> 44:25.295
Why would he do that for me

44:25.296 --> 44:27.563
if he was going
to go after Brandon?

44:27.699 --> 44:29.099
Well, it makes
perfect sense, Ali.

44:29.200 --> 44:30.501
Thank you.
Yeah.

44:30.502 --> 44:32.803
He wants you for himself,
and now he's even closer.

44:32.804 --> 44:35.271
Yeah, some guys can be
really, really possessive.

44:35.373 --> 44:37.541
Even dangerous.

44:37.542 --> 44:39.043
From everything I've heard
about this Michael guy,

44:39.044 --> 44:40.310
I don't trust him.

44:40.311 --> 44:41.545
I don't even think
you should go to this interview.

44:41.546 --> 44:42.980
I agree.

44:42.981 --> 44:44.421
Hey, how about
I stay over tonight?

44:44.549 --> 44:47.718
I mean, you're not the only one
who's freaked out here.

44:47.719 --> 44:48.852
And plus,
if he's coming after you,

44:48.853 --> 44:50.220
he's going to have to go
through me first.

44:50.221 --> 44:51.488
Well, you know what,
I'm right downstairs.

44:51.489 --> 44:53.223
I mean, we're probably
pretty safe in the house.

44:53.224 --> 44:54.358
Thanks, James,

44:54.359 --> 44:56.592
but you don't know me,
and I am vicious.

44:56.728 --> 44:59.163
I will rip his face off.

44:59.164 --> 45:00.731
Okay. Either way...

45:00.732 --> 45:02.733
we've got each other's back.

45:02.734 --> 45:04.501
Okay?

45:04.502 --> 45:06.235
Of course.
Yeah.

46:12.070 --> 46:13.904
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

46:13.905 --> 46:15.439
I heard something.

46:15.440 --> 46:16.740
Please don't say that.

46:16.741 --> 46:18.408
It was probably
just the wind, but...

46:18.409 --> 46:19.943
But what?

46:19.944 --> 46:20.977
Let's go downstairs.

46:21.079 --> 46:22.678
Okay.

46:23.782 --> 46:26.450
You know what I think you need?
New locks.

46:26.451 --> 46:28.485
I don't need new locks.

46:28.486 --> 46:29.519
Yes, you do!

46:29.654 --> 46:31.187
I'll have to change
the whole house.

46:31.322 --> 46:33.490
So at least
you'll feel more safe.

46:33.491 --> 46:34.992
And put a new lock on the
basement door once and for all.

46:34.993 --> 46:36.760
Why?

46:36.761 --> 46:38.128
Well, if you want to play
Miss Landlord,

46:38.129 --> 46:39.296
then Miss Landlord

46:39.297 --> 46:41.431
needs to put in some separation.

46:41.432 --> 46:43.967
What about James?
What about James?

46:43.968 --> 46:45.135
It's not like
he's going to be here forever.

46:45.136 --> 46:46.669
That's true.

46:46.771 --> 46:49.872
Did you see how weird he got
when I said I was staying over?

46:50.008 --> 46:51.975
Please.
Not your spidey sense again.

46:51.976 --> 46:54.577
Okay, my spidey senses
are always right, aren't they?

46:57.115 --> 46:58.348
Ali?

46:58.349 --> 47:00.484
I think we're all being
a little bit sensitive.

47:00.485 --> 47:02.752
I'm sure he was
just being protective.

47:04.022 --> 47:06.690
Okay, well, just humor me.
Okay...

47:06.691 --> 47:08.859
He came upstairs... twice.

47:08.860 --> 47:10.694
To make me food.

47:10.695 --> 47:11.862
Right, because your site

47:11.863 --> 47:13.831
didn't specifically say
that he couldn't.

47:13.832 --> 47:15.499
I mean, I'm just saying...

47:15.500 --> 47:17.634
<i>what else do you think he does
in here when you're not home?</i>

47:17.635 --> 47:19.036
<i>Sarah...</i>

47:19.037 --> 47:21.904
<i>Well, just put feelings aside
and be a landlord.</i>

47:22.040 --> 47:25.209
<i>I mean, every house
needs rules, right?</i>

47:25.210 --> 47:26.710
And if James
or some other tenant

47:26.711 --> 47:27.743
wants to stay here,

47:27.879 --> 47:28.744
then he should
have to follow them.

47:28.880 --> 47:30.681
Rules?

47:30.682 --> 47:32.081
Ali.

47:32.217 --> 47:34.250
You're so afraid
of offending people

47:34.385 --> 47:35.986
and that's how you get stuck
in these situations

47:35.987 --> 47:37.420
<i>in the first place.</i>

47:37.555 --> 47:39.890
<i>If he's as good of a guy
as you say he is,</i>

47:39.891 --> 47:41.591
<i>then he should understand.</i>

47:42.994 --> 47:44.460
You're right.

47:45.730 --> 47:47.430
Let's just go back to bed.
Okay.

48:10.421 --> 48:11.621
That's the last one?

48:11.756 --> 48:12.955
That's it.

48:13.091 --> 48:14.657
Thank you so much.

48:14.759 --> 48:16.360
You're welcome.
Awesome.

48:16.361 --> 48:17.493
Here are your new keys.

48:17.595 --> 48:18.635
Great.
Have a nice day.

48:25.236 --> 48:26.969
Locksmith, huh?

48:28.206 --> 48:29.772
Uh...

48:30.541 --> 48:32.508
Sarah convinced me.

48:33.611 --> 48:36.546
I... I put a lock
on your basement suite door,

48:36.547 --> 48:37.881
just up the stairs.

48:37.882 --> 48:39.917
Oh, good.

48:39.918 --> 48:41.484
It's good?

48:41.619 --> 48:42.719
Yeah. I mean, if you're going
to be opening up your space

48:42.720 --> 48:44.054
for strangers to stay,

48:44.055 --> 48:45.154
then absolutely.

48:46.457 --> 48:49.059
I've been so worried
about offending you,

48:49.060 --> 48:50.493
with the locks and rules.

48:50.628 --> 48:53.931
No, no, no.
Not at all.

48:53.932 --> 48:56.299
I mean,
you need to take care of you.

48:57.302 --> 48:59.402
Oh, sorry.

49:00.939 --> 49:02.338
Hello?

49:02.473 --> 49:02.873
<i>Miss Peters,
this is Detective Fitzgerald.</i>

49:02.874 --> 49:05.776
Detective.

49:05.777 --> 49:07.244
Hi. Is everything alright?

49:07.245 --> 49:08.745
<i>Yeah. We just wanted
to let you know</i>

49:08.746 --> 49:11.580
we've apprehended a suspect
in the Brandon Matthews case.

49:12.650 --> 49:13.683
You did?

49:13.818 --> 49:15.919
<i>Some intoxicated vagrant.</i>

49:15.920 --> 49:17.988
We found him with the mobile.

49:17.989 --> 49:18.956
We found him
with the lighter fluid.

49:18.957 --> 49:19.990
Everything.

49:19.991 --> 49:21.325
That is great news.

49:21.326 --> 49:22.491
<i>We still don't know why</i>

49:22.593 --> 49:24.261
Mr. Matthews thought
that number was yours,

49:24.262 --> 49:26.997
or what this guy
even had against him,

49:26.998 --> 49:28.298
<i>but once he sobers up,</i>

49:28.299 --> 49:30.267
<i>we'll get
more information out of him.</i>

49:30.268 --> 49:31.635
Okay.

49:31.636 --> 49:33.337
Let me know if there's
anything else I can do to help.

49:33.338 --> 49:34.203
<i>Will do.</i>

49:34.339 --> 49:35.571
Okay, bye.

49:40.011 --> 49:41.611
They got the guy
that murdered my boss.

49:42.613 --> 49:44.213
What do you mean,
so it wasn't Michael?

49:44.983 --> 49:46.183
I feel bad.

49:46.184 --> 49:48.518
I feel relieved, but...

49:48.519 --> 49:49.987
I feel relieved for Michael,

49:49.988 --> 49:51.721
but he is never
going to let this go.

49:52.991 --> 49:54.024
What do you mean?

49:54.025 --> 49:55.391
Well...

49:55.526 --> 49:56.960
if the police called him,
he's got a brain like a machine,

49:56.961 --> 50:00.029
so I wouldn't be surprised
if he helped them find the guy.

50:01.699 --> 50:05.034
Anyway, I should probably go
and get ready for my interview,

50:05.136 --> 50:06.169
but...

50:06.170 --> 50:07.903
so this is your new key.

50:08.039 --> 50:09.305
Thank you.

50:10.341 --> 50:12.042
Maybe we could do
dinner tonight?

50:12.043 --> 50:14.544
You can help me work on
those online rules?

50:14.545 --> 50:16.712
Yeah. That would be...
That would be really great.

50:16.814 --> 50:17.980
Okay.
Okay.

50:28.493 --> 50:29.826
It's all very impressive.

50:29.827 --> 50:31.395
Top of your debate class.

50:31.396 --> 50:32.863
Highest Bar Exam at Chase.

50:32.864 --> 50:35.699
All I know is
you were fired from Fairfax,

50:35.700 --> 50:38.502
and everyone signed
a confidentiality agreement

50:38.503 --> 50:40.102
to not speak about it.

50:40.238 --> 50:44.674
Now, I'm not asking you
to break your word,

50:44.675 --> 50:46.976
but how about you explain it
to me as best you can?

50:48.579 --> 50:50.347
It's a chapter
I like to forget about.

50:50.348 --> 50:52.114
Mm.

50:53.184 --> 50:54.351
The truth is,

50:54.352 --> 50:58.354
I had an affair
with a colleague at the firm.

50:59.323 --> 51:01.323
I didn't get fired.

51:02.260 --> 51:04.361
I quit.

51:04.362 --> 51:05.695
My life was such a mess,

51:05.696 --> 51:07.763
and I wanted to own that,

51:07.865 --> 51:08.865
and start over.

51:10.601 --> 51:12.868
I love law, Mr. Crowder.

51:14.205 --> 51:17.506
And I would give anything
to get a second chance.

51:20.278 --> 51:24.414
Your honesty is noble,
Miss Peters.

51:24.415 --> 51:26.115
As is your integrity.

51:47.572 --> 51:48.939
Whoa.
Oh!

51:48.940 --> 51:51.108
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I didn't see you there.

51:51.109 --> 51:52.189
Oh, don't worry about it.

51:53.644 --> 51:55.412
So how'd it go?

51:55.413 --> 51:56.812
It went good, I think.

51:56.914 --> 51:58.147
Good.
Yeah.

51:58.249 --> 51:59.282
I'm really happy for you.

51:59.283 --> 52:00.584
Well, let's not get happy yet.

52:00.585 --> 52:02.885
Those chickens
aren't guaranteed to hatch.

52:03.921 --> 52:06.021
They'd be fools to pass on
someone like you.

52:07.658 --> 52:09.158
Listen...

52:09.260 --> 52:11.128
I'm sorry about your boss.

52:11.129 --> 52:13.863
The police called me,
they told me what happened.

52:13.998 --> 52:16.967
I'm really sorry that
I gave your name to the police.

52:16.968 --> 52:18.635
No...

52:18.636 --> 52:20.796
you were just crossing your
"T"s and dotting your "I"s.

52:21.672 --> 52:22.952
That's why you're a good lawyer.

52:23.808 --> 52:25.241
Thank you.

52:25.343 --> 52:26.977
You might not want
to count those chickens,

52:26.978 --> 52:29.712
but I'll see you
when they hatch.

52:29.847 --> 52:30.981
Can't wait.

52:30.982 --> 52:32.414
It'll be like old times.
Yup.

52:33.784 --> 52:35.117
See you soon.
Alright.

52:36.654 --> 52:38.120
Bye.

54:13.117 --> 54:14.237
It's too bad that's not...

54:18.422 --> 54:19.556
Where are you doing, man? Huh?

54:19.557 --> 54:21.490
Why are you after me?

54:23.261 --> 54:25.421
That's a pretty stupid question
for such a smart guy.

54:28.299 --> 54:31.066
It was you, wasn't it?
You killed her boss, huh?

54:32.637 --> 54:34.136
Nothing gets past you, huh?

54:35.072 --> 54:36.439
What the hell
do you want from me, huh?

54:36.440 --> 54:37.973
What do you want from her?

54:38.909 --> 54:40.009
I just want her.

54:40.144 --> 54:43.379
Maybe some kids.
A white-picket fence.

54:45.750 --> 54:46.882
See, I want what you want.

54:48.586 --> 54:50.052
I just want it more.

54:57.161 --> 54:58.527
James?

55:29.760 --> 55:32.194
<i>And shared laundry,
but you choose the days.</i>

55:32.296 --> 55:33.797
But what if they're only here
for two days?

55:33.798 --> 55:35.698
<i>Then you set some hours.</i>

55:35.800 --> 55:37.199
Fine.

55:38.302 --> 55:40.536
Oh, I have an email.

55:42.606 --> 55:43.706
It's from Hannah.

55:44.642 --> 55:45.708
"Hey, Alison,

55:45.810 --> 55:48.377
James informed me
of your inquiries.

55:48.479 --> 55:51.948
Please send over your C.V.
at your earliest convenience."

55:51.949 --> 55:53.716
<i>That's amazing, Ali!</i>

55:53.818 --> 55:55.018
Yeah...

55:55.019 --> 55:56.653
but what about Michael?

55:56.654 --> 55:59.289
<i>You do the smart thing
and see which one sticks.</i>

55:59.290 --> 56:00.490
<i>You have your C.V. on file?</i>

56:00.491 --> 56:01.624
Of course.

56:01.625 --> 56:02.992
<i>So send it, girl!</i>

56:02.993 --> 56:04.893
<i>Roll with it while you can.</i>

56:04.995 --> 56:06.095
Okay...

56:07.031 --> 56:09.332
"Hey, Hannah!

56:09.333 --> 56:12.034
Thank you so much for your help.

56:12.136 --> 56:15.305
Here's my C.V.

56:15.306 --> 56:18.173
Looking forward
to hearing from you.

56:19.510 --> 56:21.378
Alison Peters"

56:21.379 --> 56:23.980
And send.

56:23.981 --> 56:25.382
<i>Good job.</i>

56:25.383 --> 56:27.016
Oh!

56:27.017 --> 56:28.685
I think James is back.

56:28.686 --> 56:31.554
<i>Oh... gonna go
to second base?</i>

56:31.555 --> 56:32.421
How old are you?

56:32.523 --> 56:34.724
Are we still on for tomorrow?

56:34.725 --> 56:36.493
<i>Only if you're making me.</i>

56:36.494 --> 56:37.660
I'm making you.

56:37.661 --> 56:39.094
<i>Okay.
Have fun.</i>

56:39.196 --> 56:40.329
Okay, bye.

56:43.667 --> 56:45.801
Hey, what happened?

56:47.671 --> 56:48.838
I'm embarrassed.

56:48.839 --> 56:50.006
Are you okay?

56:50.007 --> 56:51.408
Yeah, no.

56:51.409 --> 56:53.243
I went running on this trail,
and I fell pretty hard.

56:53.244 --> 56:54.777
It looks painful.

56:54.879 --> 56:55.879
No, it's alright.

56:55.880 --> 56:58.280
Here. Come inside.

56:58.382 --> 56:59.948
I'll clean you up.

57:02.887 --> 57:05.522
And that is why you should
always have a running partner.

57:05.523 --> 57:07.891
Are you offering?

57:07.892 --> 57:11.227
Well, I think Sarah would get
a little bit jealous.

57:11.228 --> 57:13.029
Didn't realize
you guys had a routine.

57:13.030 --> 57:14.197
We try...

57:14.198 --> 57:15.432
Although once a week

57:15.433 --> 57:17.867
seems to be like
all we can handle right now.

57:17.868 --> 57:19.235
We're going to go
tomorrow morning

57:19.236 --> 57:20.870
if you want to join.

57:20.871 --> 57:22.071
Yeah, I'm thinking

57:22.072 --> 57:23.406
maybe I should take
a day off for once.

57:23.407 --> 57:25.340
I think that's
probably a good idea.

57:28.546 --> 57:30.113
You know,
Hannah would never do this.

57:30.114 --> 57:31.613
No?

57:31.715 --> 57:33.515
No.

57:36.754 --> 57:38.554
Well, good thing
you have me, then.

57:39.957 --> 57:41.591
Wouldn't have it any other way,

57:41.592 --> 57:43.072
except for the scrapes
and everything.

57:45.095 --> 57:47.897
She emailed me, by the way.

57:47.898 --> 57:48.932
Oh, yeah?

57:48.933 --> 57:50.499
Mm-hmm.

57:50.601 --> 57:52.434
I sent over my C.V. to her.

57:53.404 --> 57:54.571
That's awesome.

57:54.572 --> 57:55.605
I'm excited for you.

57:55.606 --> 57:57.506
Thank you.

58:00.778 --> 58:02.458
Do you want to make dinner
with me tonight?

58:03.948 --> 58:05.180
I'd love to.

58:06.250 --> 58:07.349
Okay.

58:07.451 --> 58:08.618
Well, I'll go get started.

58:08.619 --> 58:11.186
You finish up here
and meet me downstairs?

58:11.288 --> 58:12.788
Yeah.
Okay.

58:32.676 --> 58:34.511
I remember in school,

58:34.512 --> 58:38.047
there was this kid
who copied my test.

58:38.048 --> 58:39.415
And then when he got caught,

58:39.416 --> 58:42.484
he told the teacher
that I gave him his answers.

58:42.586 --> 58:43.619
Did you?

58:43.754 --> 58:44.987
Not at all.

58:45.089 --> 58:46.055
Okay, so, I see,

58:46.056 --> 58:47.257
and then you went on
a legal crusade

58:47.258 --> 58:49.592
to try to right
all the wrongs of the world.

58:49.593 --> 58:52.961
My dad is the one who wanted me
to go into law,

58:53.097 --> 58:55.998
and I was never able to say no,

58:56.100 --> 59:00.269
and no matter what I did,
it was just never good enough.

59:03.307 --> 59:05.775
I guess that's why I...

59:05.776 --> 59:07.576
couldn't stand up to Brandon.

59:10.114 --> 59:12.447
Or any man, for that matter.

59:14.451 --> 59:15.984
No, no, no.

59:16.086 --> 59:18.320
That guy played with fire
and he got burned.

59:19.623 --> 59:20.689
What?

59:21.592 --> 59:23.292
It was just a figure of speech.

59:24.428 --> 59:27.462
Did I tell you
that he died in a fire?

59:28.432 --> 59:30.465
No, I don't think so, but...

59:31.969 --> 59:33.636
I mean, come to think of it,
I did see something on the news.

59:33.637 --> 59:35.104
Brandon...

59:35.105 --> 59:36.606
Matthews.

59:36.607 --> 59:37.506
That was your boss?

59:37.608 --> 59:38.942
Yeah.

59:38.943 --> 59:40.977
Oh, my...

59:40.978 --> 59:43.279
what a horrible way to die.

59:43.280 --> 59:45.147
Yeah.

59:55.326 --> 59:56.993
Remind me why
I agreed to this again?

59:56.994 --> 59:58.828
Because we're trying
to be more disciplined.

59:58.829 --> 01:00:00.964
How's lover boy?

01:00:02.299 --> 01:00:03.266
What? Did you sleep with him?

01:00:03.267 --> 01:00:04.200
No, not at all,

01:00:04.201 --> 01:00:05.233
it was just...

01:00:05.336 --> 01:00:06.234
What? What is it?

01:00:06.337 --> 01:00:07.637
He just said something
that was...

01:00:07.638 --> 01:00:08.837
What? What did he say?

01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:14.177
Did you tell him
that Brandon died in a fire?

01:00:14.178 --> 01:00:15.612
Why would I tell him that?

01:00:15.613 --> 01:00:17.213
He said he saw it on the news,

01:00:17.214 --> 01:00:19.849
but then when I looked online
last night for local murders,

01:00:19.850 --> 01:00:21.651
there was nothing.

01:00:21.652 --> 01:00:23.218
Huh.

01:00:24.188 --> 01:00:25.788
You know what I think?

01:00:25.789 --> 01:00:27.422
I think you're scared.

01:00:27.524 --> 01:00:28.491
Of what?

01:00:28.492 --> 01:00:31.760
Of what?
Feelings, connections.

01:00:31.862 --> 01:00:32.862
I mean, it does make sense.

01:00:32.863 --> 01:00:34.497
This is the first guy

01:00:34.498 --> 01:00:35.897
you've actually liked
in a while.

01:00:36.033 --> 01:00:37.667
You would probably find
some things to freak out about.

01:00:37.668 --> 01:00:39.869
How are the new rules going,
by the way?

01:00:39.870 --> 01:00:41.269
Perfect.

01:00:41.372 --> 01:00:43.339
He says they should have
been placed from the beginning.

01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:45.708
Okay, well, then just
enjoy it, you know?

01:00:45.709 --> 01:00:47.109
Be present.

01:00:49.213 --> 01:00:51.748
Speak of the devil.

01:00:51.749 --> 01:00:53.015
Hey.
Hey.

01:00:56.220 --> 01:00:57.252
Ladies.

01:00:57.388 --> 01:00:59.022
How are you feeling?

01:00:59.023 --> 01:01:01.256
Still a little tender,
but nothing that won't heal up.

01:01:01.358 --> 01:01:02.791
How was the run?

01:01:02.893 --> 01:01:03.893
Feels good, right?

01:01:03.894 --> 01:01:05.127
Worst decision ever.

01:01:05.229 --> 01:01:06.396
Right.

01:01:07.765 --> 01:01:09.231
Oh! It's the law firm.

01:01:10.834 --> 01:01:12.594
Well, answer it!
Put it on speaker phone.

01:01:13.037 --> 01:01:14.102
Okay.

01:01:15.939 --> 01:01:17.073
Alison Peters.

01:01:17.074 --> 01:01:18.940
<i>Alison.
It's Cameron Crowder.</i>

01:01:19.076 --> 01:01:20.376
<i>Have I caught you at a bad time?</i>

01:01:20.377 --> 01:01:22.345
No, no.
It's good to hear from you.

01:01:22.346 --> 01:01:24.047
<i>Listen, firstly...</i>

01:01:24.048 --> 01:01:26.015
<i>I want to get this
out of the way...</i>

01:01:26.016 --> 01:01:27.456
<i>We'd love for you
to join the firm.</i>

01:01:28.752 --> 01:01:29.719
Really?

01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:31.319
<i>Your honesty, your enthusiasm...</i>

01:01:31.422 --> 01:01:32.755
<i>Your resume speaks for itself.</i>

01:01:32.756 --> 01:01:33.890
<i>I'd like you to start next week.</i>

01:01:33.891 --> 01:01:34.857
I would love that!

01:01:34.858 --> 01:01:36.392
<i>Wonderful, wonderful.</i>

01:01:36.393 --> 01:01:37.459
<i>Listen, secondly,</i>

01:01:37.594 --> 01:01:38.795
<i>have you heard
from Michael at all?</i>

01:01:38.796 --> 01:01:41.597
Michael? No.

01:01:41.598 --> 01:01:42.699
<i>We haven't either.</i>

01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:43.933
<i>Not since yesterday.</i>

01:01:43.934 --> 01:01:47.169
<i>Not like him
to not return our calls.</i>

01:01:47.271 --> 01:01:48.871
You know what,

01:01:48.872 --> 01:01:50.406
I actually sent him a text
last night,

01:01:50.407 --> 01:01:52.442
and he never
got back to me either.

01:01:52.443 --> 01:01:54.176
<i>Well, it's early, I suppose.</i>

01:01:54.278 --> 01:01:56.446
<i>I'm sure he'll be in soon.</i>

01:01:56.447 --> 01:01:58.146
Yeah. I'm sure he will.

01:01:58.248 --> 01:02:00.583
<i>I'll see you in a week.</i>

01:02:00.584 --> 01:02:02.585
Yeah. Thank you so much,
Mr. Crowder.

01:02:02.586 --> 01:02:04.153
I'm really excited
to join the team.

01:02:04.154 --> 01:02:05.788
<i>You're very welcome.</i>

01:02:05.789 --> 01:02:07.557
<i>Bye now.</i>
Bye.

01:02:07.558 --> 01:02:09.825
Ali! That is amazing!

01:02:11.128 --> 01:02:13.162
That's amazing!

01:02:13.163 --> 01:02:14.397
Please tell me that you told him

01:02:14.398 --> 01:02:15.163
I could work the phones
like nobody's business.

01:02:15.265 --> 01:02:17.300
I didn't.
But I will.

01:02:17.301 --> 01:02:18.267
Okay.

01:02:18.268 --> 01:02:20.469
Congratulations.

01:02:21.438 --> 01:02:23.705
Hey, what's up?
Why don't you look happy?

01:02:23.807 --> 01:02:25.942
I just hope Michael's okay.

01:02:25.943 --> 01:02:27.977
I'm sure he's fine.

01:02:27.978 --> 01:02:29.812
Hey, you know what,
we should celebrate tonight.

01:02:29.813 --> 01:02:30.973
What do you say about dinner?

01:02:31.782 --> 01:02:33.149
Come on!
I love that.

01:02:33.150 --> 01:02:34.382
Okay.

01:02:34.485 --> 01:02:35.485
As long as you're both in.

01:02:35.486 --> 01:02:37.052
No, I don't want to be
a third wheel.

01:02:37.154 --> 01:02:38.854
What? Please, no.

01:02:38.956 --> 01:02:41.056
You know, I should probably
get to know you anyway.

01:02:41.158 --> 01:02:42.158
Yeah.
Right?

01:02:43.327 --> 01:02:44.360
Sure, yeah, okay.

01:02:44.361 --> 01:02:45.727
Good. Sweet.

01:02:48.232 --> 01:02:49.732
<i>Hi. You've reached
Michael Hammond.</i>

01:02:49.733 --> 01:02:52.434
<i>Leave a message.</i>

01:02:52.536 --> 01:02:53.569
Hey, Michael.

01:02:53.570 --> 01:02:55.905
It's Alison.

01:02:55.906 --> 01:02:57.573
Look, I've tried to call you
a few times,

01:02:57.574 --> 01:03:00.809
and I was hoping
to talk to you in person, but...

01:03:00.911 --> 01:03:02.477
I just wanted to thank you again

01:03:02.579 --> 01:03:04.980
for getting me the opening.

01:03:05.082 --> 01:03:07.250
It looks like Cameron's
going to be taking me on, so...

01:03:07.251 --> 01:03:09.886
<i>Anyway, um,</i>

01:03:09.887 --> 01:03:12.388
<i>we're having a celebratory
dinner at my house,</i>

01:03:12.389 --> 01:03:14.923
<i>and I would love it
if you could stop by.</i>

01:03:17.261 --> 01:03:18.727
<i>I hope you're okay.</i>

01:03:30.774 --> 01:03:32.441
It's open.

01:03:32.442 --> 01:03:34.577
Hey, girl.
Hey.

01:03:34.578 --> 01:03:37.580
Hey. Ooh.

01:03:37.581 --> 01:03:38.980
Is everything alright?

01:03:39.082 --> 01:03:40.616
James up here?

01:03:40.617 --> 01:03:41.650
No. He's downstairs.

01:03:41.752 --> 01:03:42.651
What's going on?

01:03:42.753 --> 01:03:44.587
Okay, Ali, um...

01:03:44.588 --> 01:03:45.988
don't get upset, alright?

01:03:45.989 --> 01:03:46.989
What?
Hello.

01:03:46.990 --> 01:03:48.758
Hey.

01:03:48.759 --> 01:03:50.158
You didn't have to bring that.

01:03:50.260 --> 01:03:51.961
Oh, no, no, no,
I'm happy to help.

01:03:51.962 --> 01:03:53.462
Did you get a hold of Michael?

01:03:53.463 --> 01:03:55.764
No, you know what,
I wasn't able to reach him.

01:03:56.633 --> 01:03:57.600
I guess we'll flip a coin

01:03:57.601 --> 01:03:58.921
to see
who's the third wheel, huh?

01:04:00.003 --> 01:04:01.870
Well, shall we?
Yeah.

01:04:01.972 --> 01:04:03.306
Yeah.
Thank you.

01:04:03.307 --> 01:04:05.040
This is delicious, by the way.

01:04:05.142 --> 01:04:08.243
I'm just really happy
that we could all get together.

01:04:09.313 --> 01:04:12.648
So Ali tells me
that your wife is a lawyer?

01:04:12.649 --> 01:04:14.482
Uh... ex-wife.

01:04:15.786 --> 01:04:17.385
Sorry. Ex-wife.

01:04:17.487 --> 01:04:18.887
What firm?

01:04:18.989 --> 01:04:22.325
Uh, Mckenzie, Latner and Co.

01:04:22.326 --> 01:04:24.192
Never heard of it.

01:04:24.294 --> 01:04:25.360
It's boutique.

01:04:25.462 --> 01:04:27.463
Got it.

01:04:27.464 --> 01:04:29.498
So your family is still in...

01:04:29.499 --> 01:04:31.167
Minnesota.

01:04:31.168 --> 01:04:32.667
Minneapolis, to be exact.

01:04:34.037 --> 01:04:38.073
Yeah, it's been a little hard
on Lilly, but...

01:04:38.175 --> 01:04:39.074
she's a strong girl.

01:04:39.176 --> 01:04:40.742
She sounds adorable.

01:04:41.645 --> 01:04:43.012
I mean, I haven't talked to her,

01:04:43.013 --> 01:04:44.480
but...

01:04:44.481 --> 01:04:46.281
I've heard James talking to her.

01:04:47.517 --> 01:04:48.583
She's everything to me.

01:04:48.685 --> 01:04:50.319
Well, she sure is cute.

01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:52.153
Looks a lot like her mom.

01:04:54.024 --> 01:04:55.224
Excuse me?

01:04:55.225 --> 01:04:57.092
Well, I mean,
from your profile picture.

01:04:58.829 --> 01:05:00.462
Why were you looking at
his profile?

01:05:01.999 --> 01:05:04.533
'Cause I was helping you
with your profile

01:05:04.534 --> 01:05:05.934
when we were doing
the house rules.

01:05:06.036 --> 01:05:06.902
Right.

01:05:07.004 --> 01:05:08.470
Yeah.

01:05:10.340 --> 01:05:11.773
Yeah, they look a lot alike.

01:05:11.875 --> 01:05:13.376
Can I get you ladies
some more wine?

01:05:13.377 --> 01:05:15.711
Yes, please.
Please. Thanks.

01:05:15.712 --> 01:05:16.879
Thank you.

01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:18.113
I could use a top-up.

01:05:18.215 --> 01:05:19.948
Thank you.

01:05:20.050 --> 01:05:21.350
And what about you two? Huh?

01:05:21.351 --> 01:05:23.019
You guys went to school
together or something?

01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:24.887
Yeah, we were in third grade,

01:05:24.888 --> 01:05:26.722
and we took the bus together.

01:05:26.723 --> 01:05:28.790
That's cute.

01:05:28.892 --> 01:05:30.526
So how long
have you been separated?

01:05:30.527 --> 01:05:31.826
Sarah, enough.

01:05:32.729 --> 01:05:34.029
What are you doing?

01:05:36.733 --> 01:05:37.767
What?

01:05:37.768 --> 01:05:39.434
He's open about her,
right, James?

01:05:39.536 --> 01:05:41.369
About a month.

01:05:42.406 --> 01:05:43.873
A month?

01:05:43.874 --> 01:05:45.408
Officially. Yeah.

01:05:45.409 --> 01:05:46.909
Thank you.

01:05:46.910 --> 01:05:48.009
Thank you.

01:05:50.380 --> 01:05:51.646
Well, that's weird, 'cause...

01:05:51.748 --> 01:05:53.982
when I look at your profile,

01:05:54.084 --> 01:05:55.618
it says that

01:05:55.619 --> 01:05:57.786
you've been renting
all across the country...

01:05:57.888 --> 01:05:59.722
For six months.

01:05:59.723 --> 01:06:00.822
Sarah.

01:06:01.959 --> 01:06:03.325
Well, ask him.

01:06:11.902 --> 01:06:14.904
You think it looks like
I've been having an affair.

01:06:14.905 --> 01:06:16.237
Were you?

01:06:23.914 --> 01:06:24.946
No.

01:06:26.450 --> 01:06:28.451
Hannah and I were trying
to fix things for a long time,

01:06:28.452 --> 01:06:30.185
and I was traveling

01:06:30.287 --> 01:06:32.220
back and forth
across the country for work.

01:06:34.791 --> 01:06:36.625
Sarah, I think
your spidey senses

01:06:36.626 --> 01:06:39.227
have had a little bit
too much tonight.

01:06:41.999 --> 01:06:44.699
If you'll excuse me,
I have to go to the bathroom.

01:06:50.007 --> 01:06:51.140
I am so sorry.

01:06:51.141 --> 01:06:53.442
I do not know
what has gotten into her.

01:06:53.443 --> 01:06:54.777
It's alright.

01:06:54.778 --> 01:06:56.738
I'm sure it's just her way
of looking out for you.

01:06:58.148 --> 01:06:59.782
Yeah...

01:06:59.783 --> 01:07:01.383
I'm really happy to be here.

01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:05.086
I'm happy that you're here, too.

01:07:12.963 --> 01:07:13.996
Is she okay?

01:07:13.997 --> 01:07:15.697
Uh, yeah.

01:07:15.799 --> 01:07:17.799
Her ride share
will be here soon.

01:07:19.202 --> 01:07:21.871
Um... listen,

01:07:21.872 --> 01:07:24.306
I...

01:07:24.307 --> 01:07:25.907
I got you something.

01:07:27.044 --> 01:07:28.210
You did?

01:07:28.211 --> 01:07:30.212
Yeah. Yeah, it's just
a little something

01:07:30.213 --> 01:07:31.780
to celebrate your new job.

01:07:38.688 --> 01:07:40.356
"A" for "Ali."

01:07:40.357 --> 01:07:41.557
I love it.

01:07:41.558 --> 01:07:42.558
Yeah?

01:07:42.559 --> 01:07:43.559
Yeah. Thank you.

01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:45.561
May I?

01:07:45.562 --> 01:07:46.562
Yeah. Of course.
Yeah?

01:07:59.242 --> 01:08:00.176
It's beautiful.

01:08:00.177 --> 01:08:01.177
Thank you.

01:08:02.212 --> 01:08:03.244
Oh, the car's here.

01:08:03.346 --> 01:08:04.346
Do you want to help me?

01:08:04.347 --> 01:08:05.580
Oh, yeah, of course.

01:08:05.682 --> 01:08:07.249
Come on, girl.

01:08:07.250 --> 01:08:09.418
The car's here.
It's time to go to bed.

01:08:09.419 --> 01:08:10.920
No, I don't want to leave.

01:08:10.921 --> 01:08:12.188
It's night-night time.

01:08:12.189 --> 01:08:13.788
I got her, I got her.
Alright.

01:08:13.890 --> 01:08:15.724
Get her home safe, okay?

01:08:15.725 --> 01:08:16.791
Good night.

01:08:16.893 --> 01:08:18.060
I love you, Ali!

01:08:18.060 --> 01:08:19.661
Love you.

01:08:23.700 --> 01:08:25.300
Well, that was eventful.

01:08:33.076 --> 01:08:35.176
Hello.
Hello.

01:09:44.981 --> 01:09:47.314
Okay...

01:10:22.886 --> 01:10:24.686
Mm...

01:10:47.377 --> 01:10:48.610
Detective Fitzgerald?

01:10:48.712 --> 01:10:49.944
It's Alison Peters.

01:10:50.046 --> 01:10:51.046
I need your help.

01:10:52.549 --> 01:10:54.516
<i>Hey, this is Sarah.
Leave a message.</i>

01:10:54.517 --> 01:10:57.253
Sarah, this is the third time
I've called you.

01:10:57.254 --> 01:10:58.220
Where are you?

01:10:58.221 --> 01:10:59.654
Call me back, please.

01:11:02.726 --> 01:11:04.026
I don't know

01:11:04.027 --> 01:11:04.759
what else you want me
to tell you, Miss Peters.

01:11:04.861 --> 01:11:06.294
You have to do something.

01:11:06.396 --> 01:11:07.795
You've seen the texts.

01:11:09.232 --> 01:11:10.699
Listen,
it's breaking and entering,

01:11:10.700 --> 01:11:11.799
it's past 3:00 A.M.

01:11:13.069 --> 01:11:15.070
It could have been
a random event, for all we know.

01:11:15.071 --> 01:11:17.271
Fitzgerald, take a look at this.

01:11:18.208 --> 01:11:19.241
That's Michael's phone.

01:11:19.242 --> 01:11:20.409
Michael Hammond?

01:11:20.410 --> 01:11:22.977
Yeah. He's been missing
for two days.

01:11:23.079 --> 01:11:24.580
Last communication...

01:11:24.581 --> 01:11:25.714
Sarah Williams
to Michael Hammond

01:11:25.715 --> 01:11:26.881
last night, 2:00 A.M.

01:11:28.084 --> 01:11:29.418
"Leave Alison and me alone.

01:11:29.419 --> 01:11:30.985
She wants nothing to do
with your firm.

01:11:31.087 --> 01:11:32.588
She's mine."

01:11:32.589 --> 01:11:34.256
No.

01:11:34.257 --> 01:11:35.758
Sarah would've never said that.

01:11:35.759 --> 01:11:37.392
So who would?

01:11:40.063 --> 01:11:41.764
<i>My spidey senses
are never wrong.</i>

01:11:41.765 --> 01:11:44.133
<i>Did you see how weird he got
when I said I was staying over?</i>

01:11:44.134 --> 01:11:45.801
<i>Who was that?</i>

01:11:45.802 --> 01:11:48.303
<i>And, frankly, he's just lucky
I wasn't there to protect you.</i>

01:11:48.405 --> 01:11:50.306
<i>Hey.</i>

01:11:50.307 --> 01:11:51.774
<i>He came upstairs twice.</i>

01:11:51.775 --> 01:11:54.442
<i>What else do you think he does
when you're not home?</i>

01:11:56.780 --> 01:11:58.247
<i>Hey, this is Sarah.
Leave a message.</i>

01:11:58.248 --> 01:12:00.014
Sarah, please call me back.

01:12:00.116 --> 01:12:01.317
I need you to call me back.

01:12:01.318 --> 01:12:03.118
I'm worried about you, okay?

01:12:03.119 --> 01:12:04.452
Where are you?

01:12:13.263 --> 01:12:14.943
That's a committed friend
you've got there.

01:12:17.300 --> 01:12:18.399
Must be nice.

01:12:29.512 --> 01:12:31.212
Sarah, can you please pick up?

01:12:31.314 --> 01:12:33.848
I went to work,
I checked the gym,

01:12:33.950 --> 01:12:35.150
I went back to your house.

01:12:35.151 --> 01:12:37.018
I'm worried about you.

01:12:39.989 --> 01:12:42.156
Sarah, just please call me back.

01:13:16.359 --> 01:13:17.859
James?

01:13:23.133 --> 01:13:24.832
Screw the rules.

01:13:34.344 --> 01:13:35.810
Hello?

01:13:45.221 --> 01:13:46.654
James?

01:13:57.200 --> 01:13:59.000
Hello?

01:14:05.375 --> 01:14:06.908
I shouldn't be here.

01:14:45.949 --> 01:14:47.949
Hannah's phone number.

01:14:48.952 --> 01:14:49.952
Okay...

01:15:00.463 --> 01:15:01.996
<i>Hello?</i>

01:15:02.098 --> 01:15:05.968
Is this Hannah Brewer?

01:15:05.969 --> 01:15:08.837
<i>This is her sister.
Who is this?</i>

01:15:08.838 --> 01:15:11.006
This is Alison Peters.

01:15:11.007 --> 01:15:13.040
<i>Do I know you?</i>

01:15:13.142 --> 01:15:14.509
I'm the landlord

01:15:14.611 --> 01:15:17.879
that rented
the basement suite to James.

01:15:17.981 --> 01:15:19.314
<i>Oh, my gosh.</i>

01:15:19.315 --> 01:15:21.850
<i>He's doing it again.</i>

01:15:21.851 --> 01:15:22.851
What?

01:15:22.986 --> 01:15:24.552
<i>He's not who you think he is.</i>

01:15:24.654 --> 01:15:27.014
<i>You need to get off the phone
right now and call the police!</i>

01:15:58.488 --> 01:15:59.488
Oh!

01:16:00.490 --> 01:16:01.690
Sarah?

01:16:01.691 --> 01:16:03.391
Oh, honey.

01:16:04.861 --> 01:16:06.528
We're going
to get you out of here, okay?

01:16:09.499 --> 01:16:11.139
Doesn't this go
against the house rules?

01:16:13.836 --> 01:16:15.102
James, what are you doing?

01:16:15.204 --> 01:16:17.044
I really wish you hadn't
come down here, Ali.

01:16:17.307 --> 01:16:18.540
I didn't see anything.

01:16:18.541 --> 01:16:19.675
You didn't see anything?
No.

01:16:19.676 --> 01:16:20.876
You didn't see Sarah
right there?

01:16:20.877 --> 01:16:22.076
My computer right there?

01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:24.979
Is it true?

01:16:26.382 --> 01:16:27.382
Did you kill them?

01:16:30.853 --> 01:16:32.987
You talked to Hannah's sister,
didn't you?

01:16:33.890 --> 01:16:35.130
I'm guessing she filled you in.

01:16:36.559 --> 01:16:38.060
But I heard you talking to them.

01:16:38.061 --> 01:16:39.660
Are you sure about that?

01:16:40.730 --> 01:16:42.431
Oh, hi, sweetie.

01:16:42.432 --> 01:16:44.199
That's great.

01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:46.068
I can't wait to see you, too.

01:16:46.069 --> 01:16:47.709
Hey, put your mom
on the phone, would you?

01:16:49.539 --> 01:16:51.472
So, all those emails
from Hannah,

01:16:51.574 --> 01:16:52.807
they weren't real?

01:16:52.909 --> 01:16:55.877
I'm just trying to make it
work with us, Ali.

01:16:55.878 --> 01:16:58.179
And I was really hoping that
you'd be wearing this today.

01:17:00.416 --> 01:17:01.916
I took that off to go to bed.

01:17:03.252 --> 01:17:04.219
You went into my room?

01:17:04.220 --> 01:17:06.153
You came down to mine,
didn't you?

01:17:06.255 --> 01:17:07.455
That was a mistake.

01:17:10.593 --> 01:17:11.593
It's always the same.

01:17:13.596 --> 01:17:15.036
It's always the same.

01:17:23.906 --> 01:17:25.072
Come here!

01:17:26.643 --> 01:17:28.075
Let go of me!

01:17:46.496 --> 01:17:48.696
Come on!

01:17:48.798 --> 01:17:50.164
Alison.

01:17:57.807 --> 01:17:58.906
Alison.

01:18:01.310 --> 01:18:03.010
I know you saw
some things down there.

01:18:05.982 --> 01:18:08.222
But I think if we just have
a chance to speak about it...

01:18:10.653 --> 01:18:11.986
it can all be explained.

01:18:21.164 --> 01:18:23.597
Everything I've done
has been for you.

01:18:47.356 --> 01:18:48.856
Stop it!

01:18:50.293 --> 01:18:51.559
Please, please!

01:18:54.163 --> 01:18:55.731
Don't make this harder
than it has to be.

01:18:55.732 --> 01:18:56.797
No!

01:19:00.670 --> 01:19:02.903
Why are you doing this?

01:19:03.539 --> 01:19:05.540
I always do
everything for you...

01:19:05.541 --> 01:19:07.608
I hold doors for you,

01:19:07.710 --> 01:19:08.943
I buy you things,

01:19:09.045 --> 01:19:10.845
and all I want
is a little love in return.

01:19:12.849 --> 01:19:14.782
It's getting quiet now,
isn't it?

01:19:14.884 --> 01:19:16.417
It's dark.

01:19:55.925 --> 01:19:57.725
Look who decided
to make a final appearance.

01:19:59.595 --> 01:20:01.897
You know,
Hannah loved flowers, too.

01:20:01.898 --> 01:20:03.631
They were her "special place."

01:20:05.101 --> 01:20:07.802
She wouldn't let me
go near them, of course.

01:20:07.904 --> 01:20:09.944
Said I couldn't be trusted
with such fragile things.

01:20:11.307 --> 01:20:12.606
That's ironic.

01:20:14.110 --> 01:20:15.310
People and their boundaries...

01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:20.240
She had no problem sleeping
with somebody else, though.

01:20:20.783 --> 01:20:23.050
No problem crossing
those boundaries, did she?

01:20:25.454 --> 01:20:26.774
They still haven't found
her body.

01:20:29.959 --> 01:20:31.292
That doesn't
surprise me, though.

01:20:32.795 --> 01:20:34.195
It can be very difficult

01:20:34.297 --> 01:20:36.497
for people to see what lies
below the surface sometimes.

01:20:37.767 --> 01:20:38.799
You should know that.

01:20:42.438 --> 01:20:43.470
You ready?

01:20:45.975 --> 01:20:48.209
From what I've read,

01:20:48.311 --> 01:20:49.578
once the dirt hits your face,

01:20:49.579 --> 01:20:51.779
it takes about eight minutes
for you to suffocate.

01:20:54.617 --> 01:20:56.617
The worms will be on your body
for around a year...

01:20:58.855 --> 01:21:01.323
Then after that,

01:21:01.324 --> 01:21:02.523
there will be nothing left.

01:21:10.333 --> 01:21:12.653
I really wish it could have been
different between us, Ali.

01:21:14.971 --> 01:21:17.005
Don't do that.

01:21:17.006 --> 01:21:18.006
You haven't earned that.

01:21:27.850 --> 01:21:28.850
What?

01:21:36.025 --> 01:21:37.959
I don't care
that you've been bad.

01:21:37.960 --> 01:21:39.627
I've been bad!

01:21:40.863 --> 01:21:42.897
It doesn't matter.

01:21:42.999 --> 01:21:44.331
I don't care.

01:21:46.869 --> 01:21:48.068
We all do bad things.

01:22:11.727 --> 01:22:13.160
Bitch!

01:22:43.426 --> 01:22:45.359
Love you, bestie!

01:22:48.397 --> 01:22:49.630
Turn out he's been connected

01:22:49.732 --> 01:22:51.899
with seven other murders
across state lines.

01:22:53.436 --> 01:22:55.202
You're the first person
to get away.

01:22:56.939 --> 01:22:58.706
I can't believe I trusted him.

01:22:59.742 --> 01:23:00.976
Well,

01:23:00.977 --> 01:23:02.843
human nature is still
what it always was.

01:23:02.945 --> 01:23:05.279
We believe what we think is true
until we don't.

01:23:06.282 --> 01:23:07.181
I'm just glad

01:23:07.283 --> 01:23:08.549
you lived to talk about it.

01:23:20.763 --> 01:23:22.843
Crowder and Associates,
how may I direct your call?

01:23:23.966 --> 01:23:24.966
One moment, please.

01:23:37.146 --> 01:23:38.146
Miller's on line two.

01:23:38.147 --> 01:23:40.114
Can you take a message?

01:23:41.117 --> 01:23:42.250
Hey, you want to go get lunch?

01:23:42.251 --> 01:23:43.284
I am starving.

01:23:43.285 --> 01:23:44.885
Kinda craving some Mexican.

01:23:44.987 --> 01:23:46.287
Ooh.

01:23:46.288 --> 01:23:47.789
<i>Si, por favor.</i>

01:23:47.790 --> 01:23:49.123
All right.

01:23:56.665 --> 01:23:57.832
I've been meaning to tell you,

01:23:57.833 --> 01:23:59.868
my new client
is so easy to work with.

01:23:59.869 --> 01:24:01.568
That's because
he has you on his side.

01:24:01.670 --> 01:24:03.671
Well, I'm just lucky
I have you on my side.

01:24:03.672 --> 01:24:05.006
Besties forever.
You know it.

01:24:05.007 --> 01:24:06.474
Hey, have you seen

01:24:06.475 --> 01:24:08.009
that cute guy
who works down the hall?

01:24:08.010 --> 01:24:10.645
Yeah, he's almost cute enough
to rent a basement suite to?

01:24:10.646 --> 01:24:12.180
Ali!

01:24:12.181 --> 01:24:13.181
Very funny.

01:24:13.182 --> 01:24:14.315
Okay. Too soon?

01:24:14.316 --> 01:24:30.264
Too soon!
Alright.
