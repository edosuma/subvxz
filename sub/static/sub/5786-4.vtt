00:00.835 --> 00:02.420
<i>Previously on iZombie...</i>

00:02.629 --> 00:05.006
The night of the boat party,
you were selling
tainted Utopium.

00:05.215 --> 00:07.008
<i>We need more of it
if we're gonna make more
of the cure.</i>

00:07.217 --> 00:08.802
I didn't cut it.
But I know who did.

00:09.010 --> 00:10.345
<i>There are zombies
living among us.</i>

00:10.553 --> 00:11.721
- You want me to kill them?
- Yes.

00:11.930 --> 00:13.056
You've got the wrong man
for the job.

00:13.264 --> 00:15.266
We do know of one zombie,
Liv Moore.

00:15.475 --> 00:17.018
Got you over a barrel,
big guy.

00:17.936 --> 00:18.853
<i>Utopium!</i>

00:19.062 --> 00:20.897
We need to get more of this!

00:21.106 --> 00:23.274
<i>You would not believe
the guy we hired.</i>

00:23.483 --> 00:26.194
- I get it.
You're not talking to me.
- I just need some time.

00:26.403 --> 00:28.321
<i>For anyone in
the Utopium trade,
party's over.</i>

00:28.530 --> 00:31.282
Not a word from Peyton
in three months. And then
she just shows up?

00:34.202 --> 00:37.288
Yeah, my left nut
you went to third base
with Jolene Fisk.

00:37.497 --> 00:40.083
You don't got to believe it.
I've got my memories.

00:40.291 --> 00:43.461
Up the shirt's not third.
Third's in-the-pants stuff.

00:43.670 --> 00:46.673
Shut up, Butterball.
The only boobs
you've ever seen are your own.

00:46.881 --> 00:48.633
Dude, toss the beer.

00:48.842 --> 00:50.051
Get down!

01:01.354 --> 01:02.689
No way!

01:04.107 --> 01:05.442
What the...

01:07.777 --> 01:09.320
Dude.

01:14.868 --> 01:17.328
You jackasses ready
to have some fun?

01:46.524 --> 01:48.985
<i>Seattle police are in pursuit
of an armed suspect</i>

01:49.194 --> 01:51.529
<i>who gunned down a
clerk at this Sack & Pack</i>

01:51.738 --> 01:53.406
<i>in Queen Anne last night.</i>

01:53.615 --> 01:56.910
<i>Security footage shows a...</i>

01:57.118 --> 02:00.622
5, 6, 7, 8.

02:00.830 --> 02:05.043
That's 1, 2, 3,
and 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

02:06.336 --> 02:07.962
Nice!

02:08.171 --> 02:10.673
Great job today,
early birdies!

02:26.648 --> 02:28.399
I missed you so much.

02:29.234 --> 02:31.361
God, I know.

02:31.569 --> 02:33.571
So hard.

02:33.780 --> 02:35.657
I'm gonna spill your juice.

02:37.158 --> 02:39.494
You stalked me
and you brought me a present?

02:41.162 --> 02:43.998
That birthday cake
you left last night.
It meant the world to me.

02:47.377 --> 02:48.670
Look, um...

02:50.171 --> 02:51.631
When I left,

02:53.925 --> 02:56.010
I can't lie, I resented you.

02:56.219 --> 03:00.348
I can't tell if it was more,
"I can't believe
my best friend is a zombie,"

03:00.557 --> 03:03.059
or, "I can't believe
my best friend didn't tell me
she's a zombie."

03:03.268 --> 03:05.937
- I get that.
- While I was away
I had a chance to really

03:06.146 --> 03:08.773
put myself in
your shoes, and...

03:08.982 --> 03:12.694
Ugh, I realized how hard
this last year must have been
for you.

03:12.902 --> 03:16.239
You gave up being a surgeon,
you gave up the love
of your life.

03:16.447 --> 03:17.949
And then I bailed.

03:18.158 --> 03:19.909
Well,

03:20.118 --> 03:23.079
to be fair,
you had just seen me
stab someone in the head.

03:23.288 --> 03:25.957
Knives sticking out of you
like a pin cushion.

03:26.166 --> 03:28.501
Eyes all red. Yeah.

03:28.710 --> 03:31.963
No! Ravi needs me.
But we have to celebrate soon.

03:32.172 --> 03:34.966
And I have zombie questions.
Okay?

03:35.175 --> 03:37.010
I mean, I wrote them down.
They're a few pages.

03:38.845 --> 03:41.556
- Thank you for coming back.
- I love you, too. Go.

04:14.005 --> 04:15.215
Damn it.

04:21.012 --> 04:23.014
Mmm.

04:23.223 --> 04:26.100
Cut me off a piece
of that for breakfast.

04:26.309 --> 04:27.894
Oh, Rita.

04:30.355 --> 04:32.148
Fine.

04:32.357 --> 04:35.151
I'll fend for myself.

04:35.360 --> 04:39.656
Check a few zombie souls
off your little list today,
like a good boy.

04:39.864 --> 04:41.449
As you wish.

04:43.493 --> 04:46.663
- Major?
- Yeah, man. Sorry I'm late.

04:49.582 --> 04:51.209
Aw! Hey, Dog.

04:51.417 --> 04:55.713
Yeah, that's the smell of sex
and self-loathing.

04:55.922 --> 04:58.049
Sorry I'm late. I knew I had
to take you to work.

04:58.258 --> 05:00.260
Had my alarm set.
But, uh, my phone
ran out of juice.

05:00.468 --> 05:02.345
Don't worry about it.
I get my car back today.

05:02.553 --> 05:05.723
- That said, things are
different now with Minor here.
- Minor?

05:05.932 --> 05:08.768
- He was whining all night.
- You named the dog Minor?

05:08.977 --> 05:10.853
Then he found his way
into the bathroom trash.

05:11.062 --> 05:14.524
Dude, I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.
You ready to go?

05:14.732 --> 05:17.193
Oh, actually...

05:22.949 --> 05:24.575
Oh.

05:24.784 --> 05:26.452
- You are here.
- Yeah, that'll happen
occasionally.

05:26.661 --> 05:28.746
You know, I uh,
live here, so...

05:28.955 --> 05:32.333
Oh, sorry, I uh... It didn't
seem like you were gonna show,
so I called Liv.

05:32.542 --> 05:35.378
Oh, my God! You have a dog?

05:35.586 --> 05:37.505
Hiya, cutie, what's your name?

05:37.714 --> 05:39.215
- Minor.
- Dog.

05:41.759 --> 05:45.430
Yeah, anyway, uh,
I should take him out.
So, come on.

05:51.602 --> 05:52.812
Still needs time.

05:55.648 --> 05:57.358
Hmm. Bat signal. Shall we?

06:01.112 --> 06:04.324
Only one guy at the door?
Where is everyone?

06:08.745 --> 06:10.621
Bit of a skeleton crew today.

06:10.830 --> 06:13.583
Oh, a cashier was shot
at a Sack & Pack
in Queen Anne.

06:13.791 --> 06:15.418
Lot of resources
going to the manhunt.

06:15.626 --> 06:17.670
Lots of convenience store
clerks get shot.

06:17.879 --> 06:20.798
But the shmancy ones
in Queen Anne get a manhunt?
That hardly seems fair.

06:21.007 --> 06:23.134
- Hey, you preaching
to the choir.
- How about you, love?

06:23.343 --> 06:25.803
- Any thoughts on fairness?
- This is Lacy Cantrell.

06:26.012 --> 06:28.639
Thirty-two years old.
Transplanted Texan.

06:28.848 --> 06:31.434
She's a waitress
at that country music joint,
The Slow Roll.

06:31.642 --> 06:34.103
Her landlady found her
when she came by
to collect overdue rent.

06:34.312 --> 06:37.190
Oh, we'll have to confirm
with autopsy, but the bruise
pattern and petechia

06:37.398 --> 06:38.983
both suggest
manual strangulation.

06:39.192 --> 06:41.277
Closet door was found open.

06:41.486 --> 06:44.322
There's hangers knocked down,
clothes and stockings
trampled on the floor.

06:44.530 --> 06:46.574
Could be our killer
was waiting for her
in the closet.

06:46.783 --> 06:48.493
I'd scrape
under her fingernails
for skin samples,

06:48.701 --> 06:50.620
but the dish gloves
likely mean no DNA.

06:50.828 --> 06:55.708
No DNA. Nobody saw anything,
nobody heard anything.
A flying start.

06:55.917 --> 06:57.335
What about you, Zoltar?

06:57.543 --> 07:00.630
Johnny Cash, Loretta Lynn,
Dolly Parton.

07:00.838 --> 07:02.882
I'd say Lacy was
a little bit country.

07:03.091 --> 07:06.260
And I'm a little bit
"let's rock and roll."
Tell me something I can't see.

07:14.143 --> 07:17.313
Lacy was sending letters
to a man named Matt Sudak.

07:17.522 --> 07:19.857
Up at the State Penitentiary
in Walla Walla.

07:20.066 --> 07:22.068
They were all
sent back unopened.

07:22.276 --> 07:23.820
Didn't see that.

07:25.530 --> 07:26.697
Mmm.

07:27.740 --> 07:29.575
Come in.

07:29.784 --> 07:31.369
This is my voice
when I'm happy.

07:31.577 --> 07:34.372
You want a gold star?
Find me the gun.

07:37.583 --> 07:40.044
Manhunt's over. We got
the convenience store shooter.

07:40.253 --> 07:43.214
Same clothes he was wearing
in the footage, and he had
400 bucks on him.

07:43.423 --> 07:45.883
The amount missing
from the register. But no gun.

07:46.092 --> 07:49.512
- Enough to hold him...
- But we need the gun
to make it stick.

07:49.720 --> 07:53.474
This is FBI Agent Dale Bozzio.
She'll be working out of
our offices for a while,

07:53.683 --> 07:55.685
looking into a string
of missing person cases.

07:55.893 --> 07:58.187
It seems someone
is targeting rich guys
in Seattle.

07:58.396 --> 08:00.565
First, Alan York,
the astronaut, went missing.

08:00.773 --> 08:04.068
Then, there was
Tim Addis, heir to
the Addis timber fortune.

08:04.277 --> 08:05.987
Followed closely
by Colin Andrews,

08:06.195 --> 08:08.573
a tech pioneer
who was last seen jogging
in Seward Park.

08:08.781 --> 08:10.908
We want a download
on Terrence Fowler.

08:11.117 --> 08:13.661
I understand he's missing now,
and he fits the profile.

08:13.828 --> 08:16.038
Fowler's wife, Taylor,
was a murder-for-hire.

08:16.247 --> 08:19.250
I figured he took off,
given the suspicion that
he was somehow involved.

08:19.459 --> 08:23.212
- But my APB got no hits.
- I'd like to take a look
at anything you have on him.

08:23.421 --> 08:25.298
- If you don't mind.
- He doesn't.

08:25.506 --> 08:28.509
Help her out with whatever
she needs, Babineaux.

08:29.677 --> 08:30.928
Happy to.

08:41.481 --> 08:44.942
God help me,
that smells sensational.

08:47.320 --> 08:49.238
The man locked up
in Walla Walla,

08:49.447 --> 08:51.991
the one our victim sent
all these unopened letters to,

08:52.200 --> 08:54.035
was a boyfriend. Matt Sudak.

08:54.243 --> 08:57.079
They moved here
together from Texas.
Seems he and Lacy broke up

08:57.288 --> 08:59.624
while he was in the joint,
after she confirmed
in one of these

08:59.832 --> 09:02.251
that she had a one-night stand
with one of his buddies.

09:02.460 --> 09:04.837
According to his P.O.,
Sudak was released
a month ago.

09:05.046 --> 09:06.631
Sounds promising.

09:06.839 --> 09:08.966
Well, these make it sound like
Matt wasn't the type of guy

09:09.175 --> 09:10.593
who'd let Lacy go
without a fight.

09:10.801 --> 09:13.638
She sent this one
a week before he was released.

09:13.846 --> 09:16.307
"I can't stop thinking about
that run-down motel

09:16.516 --> 09:17.808
"on the way from Lubbock.

09:18.017 --> 09:21.187
"About your smell
and your weight on me..."

09:21.395 --> 09:24.732
- Oh, sorry, wrong spot.
- Sounds like the right
spot to me.

09:24.941 --> 09:28.611
Clive.
This is a, uh, safe zone.

09:28.819 --> 09:30.488
Tell us about
his weight on you.

09:30.696 --> 09:33.366
Here we go.

09:33.574 --> 09:35.493
"I can't stop thinking about
that bar in Lubbock,

09:35.701 --> 09:37.703
"when that wildcatter
started chatting me up.

09:37.912 --> 09:39.956
"You threw him clean
across the room.

09:40.164 --> 09:41.707
"When we made love that..."

09:41.916 --> 09:43.125
Oh, okay. Yeah, right.

09:43.334 --> 09:45.211
I hate that phrase,
"made love."

09:45.419 --> 09:48.047
It's like sex went
and hired a PR firm.

09:48.256 --> 09:51.467
Well, I just say, "do sex."
You know, like, uh...

09:51.676 --> 09:54.011
"Thank you for doing sex
with me."

09:56.180 --> 09:58.683
Okay. Um, here. Uh...

09:58.891 --> 10:01.852
Here we go.
"I know when you get out
we won't be together again.

10:02.061 --> 10:03.896
"I know I gotta let you go.

10:04.105 --> 10:07.066
"Promise me when you're out,
you'll forget about me.
Please..."

10:07.275 --> 10:10.820
<i>♪ I got to let you go ♪</i>

10:14.740 --> 10:17.868
"Please just tell me
you won't do anything crazy."

10:18.077 --> 10:21.706
Crazy is Sue's M.O.
He was doing 15 months
for aggravated assault.

10:21.914 --> 10:23.958
He put a guy in the hospital
in a barroom brawl.

10:24.166 --> 10:25.793
Nearly beat him to death
with a pool cue.

10:26.002 --> 10:28.546
Spurned lover
with a wicked temper
could be our guy.

10:28.754 --> 10:30.715
Lacy was choked
to death so hard,

10:30.923 --> 10:35.052
there were fractures
in her hyloid bone
and laryngeal cartilage.

10:35.261 --> 10:37.597
Sue's working
at a pawn shop downtown.
Wanna go for a ride?

10:37.805 --> 10:40.766
Does a one-legged duck
swim in circles?

10:41.726 --> 10:43.394
Is a pig's rump pork?

10:43.603 --> 10:47.148
I'm gonna start walking.
If all that meant yes,
catch up.

10:54.822 --> 10:56.032
- Hey there.
- Hi.

10:56.240 --> 10:57.658
Lookin'
for anything particular?

10:57.867 --> 10:59.327
Matt Sudak.

10:59.535 --> 11:02.121
In back.

11:02.330 --> 11:04.540
Sue! Ya got visitors.

11:07.501 --> 11:09.587
Seattle's finest.
That was quick.

11:09.795 --> 11:11.297
You were expecting us?

11:11.505 --> 11:13.591
Makes sense when
you're a parolee
whose ex gets murdered.

11:13.799 --> 11:16.636
Why don't you start with
the last time you saw Lacy.

11:16.844 --> 11:18.846
I only seen her once
since I got out of the joint.

11:19.013 --> 11:21.766
Went down to
The Slow Roll one night
and she was on stage.

11:21.974 --> 11:24.977
Lacy's been writing songs,
singing 'em for a long time.

11:25.186 --> 11:27.521
All these old feelings
came rushing back,
so I got up and left.

11:27.730 --> 11:29.857
I never spoke a word.

11:30.066 --> 11:32.526
Still, I'd have laid down
in traffic if she asked me to.

11:32.735 --> 11:33.986
She wanted you to forgive her.

11:34.195 --> 11:35.905
How would you know
what she wanted?

11:36.113 --> 11:38.074
All those letters that
she sent you, that you
never bothered to read?

11:38.282 --> 11:39.200
I did.

11:44.538 --> 11:48.000
Then I guess you know
all about her hookin' up
with my so-called friend?

11:48.209 --> 11:51.796
She couldn't wait a year
for me! It was a test,
and she failed it.

11:52.004 --> 11:54.006
Ever think that maybe you
failed a test when you nearly

11:54.215 --> 11:56.634
beat a man to death
with a pool cue?

12:00.012 --> 12:02.723
Let's start over.
How 'bout you tell us
where you were last night?

12:02.932 --> 12:04.475
Last night I was drinkin'
with my buddy Phil.

12:04.684 --> 12:06.435
He's right out front.
Go and ask him.

12:06.644 --> 12:08.145
When we're done here.

12:10.940 --> 12:14.485
As expected, he was a peach.

12:14.694 --> 12:17.947
Phil. You mind telling us
where you were last night
around 10:00?

12:18.155 --> 12:22.243
Uh, my place.
Knocking back a few beers.
With Sue.

12:22.410 --> 12:23.494
He was with me all night.

12:25.538 --> 12:27.123
You got a
good eye there, miss.

12:27.331 --> 12:29.834
- How long
you been playing?
- Just picked it up.

12:32.712 --> 12:34.088
Just like ringing a bell.

12:34.296 --> 12:37.133
I'll take it.

12:37.341 --> 12:40.344
Why don't you wrap up
one of those banjos for me
while we're at it?

12:40.553 --> 12:42.680
Later, we'll do some
pickin' and grinnin'.

12:42.888 --> 12:45.266
I'll be in the car.

12:45.474 --> 12:48.728
So, that's a no on the banjo?

12:48.936 --> 12:55.860
<i>♪ When you near
beat a man to death
and got yourself thrown in</i>

12:56.068 --> 13:02.616
<i>♪ Walla Walla State Pen ♪</i>

13:02.825 --> 13:04.994
Love and murder.
Country song staples.

13:05.202 --> 13:07.204
It's called <i>The Ballad
of Sue and Lacy.</i>

13:07.413 --> 13:10.416
It's a working title.
I'm hoping a clue
might come out of it.

13:12.710 --> 13:14.170
Are you wearing cologne?

13:14.378 --> 13:17.381
Uh, it's called Desire-Rx.

13:17.590 --> 13:20.384
It has human pheromones in it.

13:20.593 --> 13:23.053
- I'm a walking sex experiment.
- Seeing Steph again tonight?

13:23.262 --> 13:25.723
Obviously.
She's my test subject.

13:25.931 --> 13:27.725
Look at you!

13:27.933 --> 13:30.936
You don't know whether
to wind your watch
or scratch your ass.

13:31.145 --> 13:32.396
I'm fairly certain I do.

13:32.605 --> 13:34.565
My watch self-winds.

13:34.774 --> 13:36.734
My ass, on the other hand...

13:39.153 --> 13:42.823
You're wearing a cologne
made of pheromones?

13:43.032 --> 13:44.867
How do you know
whose pheromones
are even in there?

13:45.075 --> 13:47.912
You think the cologne makers
were like, "Hey,
death-row inmate,

13:48.120 --> 13:51.123
"scrape some pheromones
into this cup. There's a pack
of cigarettes in it for ya."

13:51.332 --> 13:53.501
- It's a possibility.
- Me, I choose to believe

13:53.709 --> 13:56.253
they have the Hemsworth
brothers on an elliptical
wearing nothing but sponges.

13:56.462 --> 13:59.215
That would explain
why I like it so much.

14:01.383 --> 14:04.428
Major! Feel free to go
straight upstairs!

14:04.637 --> 14:07.431
Oh. Hi. Sorry, guys.

14:07.640 --> 14:08.891
You're not Major.

14:09.099 --> 14:11.185
- Hi, I'm Steph.
- Hi. Peyton.

14:11.393 --> 14:15.898
So, uh, what's
with the, uh suitcases?
Is, uh, everything okay?

14:16.106 --> 14:18.400
It was until
you just asked that.

14:18.609 --> 14:22.446
Wait, did Major not tell you?
He said I could crash here
until my new place is ready.

14:22.655 --> 14:24.615
He did not.

14:24.824 --> 14:27.785
Uh, but you know, hey,
you're
welcome here, you know.

14:27.993 --> 14:30.371
That's sweet. Thank you.

14:30.579 --> 14:34.375
Well. I'm starving.
So, I'll just drop
my suitcases

14:34.583 --> 14:36.126
and go out and grab something.

14:36.335 --> 14:37.962
- Nice to meet you, Steph.
- Yeah.

14:42.299 --> 14:45.052
That's the girl
you used to date?

14:45.261 --> 14:46.846
Damn, playa!

14:47.054 --> 14:49.974
No, no. I'm not high-fiving
that. I wasn't born yesterday.

14:55.563 --> 14:57.648
Hey.

14:57.857 --> 15:01.443
- Manager around?
- He's holed up in the back
right now. Under the weather.

15:01.652 --> 15:03.487
Something I can help you with?

15:05.197 --> 15:07.783
Follow me.

15:07.992 --> 15:11.495
It's like a nightmare
come true. We're all just
heartbroken about Lacy.

15:13.747 --> 15:15.666
- When did you see her last?
- When she clocked out
last night.

15:15.875 --> 15:17.167
I'd say, around 9:00?

15:17.376 --> 15:19.295
Did she leave with anyone?
Argue with anyone?

15:19.503 --> 15:23.507
No, everyone loved Lacy.
I mean, she was a...
She was a spitfire.

15:23.716 --> 15:25.217
Was she acting
strangely at all?

15:25.426 --> 15:27.344
Well, she seemed a little
frazzled about her finances.

15:27.553 --> 15:29.722
I mean, she asked for
an advance on her paycheck.

15:29.930 --> 15:32.600
Maybe she owed
someone some money.

15:37.021 --> 15:39.356
- You, uh, you here
about little Lacy?
- That's right.

15:39.565 --> 15:41.984
She was my favorite.
I always sat in her section.

15:42.192 --> 15:44.445
I don't know
if this means anything,
but last night I heard

15:44.653 --> 15:47.489
the manager,
Rick, and Lacy hollerin'
at each other.

15:47.698 --> 15:52.411
I don't know what about, but
I saw her take a pot of
coffee and dump it in his lap.

15:52.620 --> 15:55.414
He screamed like a stuck pig.
She flew outta here.

15:55.623 --> 15:58.709
Took a tire iron to Rick's
taillight before she peeled
out of the parking lot.

16:05.007 --> 16:08.469
Well, butter my butt
and call it a biscuit.

16:15.309 --> 16:19.229
Richard Dipalma, goes by Rick.
White male, maybe 5'11",
red hair, medium build.

16:19.813 --> 16:22.816
Just go with this LKA.
When you
bring him in, call me.

16:23.025 --> 16:26.445
They'll try to pick him
up at home.

16:26.654 --> 16:30.324
Look at this.
Bandages, ice packs,
burn ointment.

16:33.577 --> 16:35.454
About
that cash advance,

16:35.663 --> 16:37.957
I think we can work
something out. Hmm?

16:38.165 --> 16:40.668
What?

16:42.252 --> 16:43.462
What'd you see?

16:45.923 --> 16:47.466
Rick,

16:47.675 --> 16:50.511
trying to hump Lacy
like she was the corner
of a La-Z-Boy.

16:50.719 --> 16:52.596
He was offering her
a cash advance in return.

16:52.805 --> 16:55.140
The only action he got was
an elbow in the gut.

16:55.349 --> 16:58.143
I'm guessing it
pissed her off enough
to pour coffee on him.

16:58.352 --> 17:00.270
She rejected him,
burned the hell out of him,

17:00.479 --> 17:02.106
humiliated him in front
front of his customers.

17:02.314 --> 17:05.150
Sounds like a few good reasons
you might wanna kill someone.

17:12.032 --> 17:14.368
Two of our customers
have gone missing now, Chief.

17:14.576 --> 17:16.578
Two. Poof. Gone.

17:16.787 --> 17:18.998
Like it's the friggin' rich
zombie rapture.

17:19.206 --> 17:22.626
Can't a guy make an honest
living creating undead and
selling them cadaver brains?

17:22.835 --> 17:23.919
Huh?

17:25.462 --> 17:28.632
"Two's not that bad."
Smiley face.

17:28.841 --> 17:31.093
I appreciate the pep talk,
big fella. I really do.

17:31.301 --> 17:33.887
But I don't think there's
an emoji that
rightfully expresses

17:34.096 --> 17:36.932
my feelings about losing
50K a month. You know?

17:41.645 --> 17:43.814
- I found Gabriel.
- The archangel?

17:44.023 --> 17:47.401
Gabriel cut the Utopium
the night of the boat party.

17:47.609 --> 17:49.278
And you're never gonna
guess where he is now.

17:51.155 --> 17:53.991
I've walked through the
valley of death,

17:54.199 --> 17:58.078
and it looks a lot like
a crack den on Third Avenue.

17:58.287 --> 18:00.956
I've led myself unto
temptation.

18:01.165 --> 18:04.001
Tried every drug in the book.

18:04.209 --> 18:08.172
And I can tell you,
the most powerful drug
you can take

18:08.380 --> 18:10.299
is the drug called "love."

18:10.507 --> 18:13.052
And it comes from a pusher
named Jesus. And...

18:13.260 --> 18:15.679
That's him, that's Gabriel.

18:15.888 --> 18:17.139
Does it have to be?

18:19.516 --> 18:20.851
Welcome, brothers.

18:21.060 --> 18:22.644
Have you heard the good news?

18:22.853 --> 18:25.814
- Jesus saves.
- That is good news.

18:26.023 --> 18:27.441
Do you know
where he shops?

18:31.528 --> 18:34.698
What happened to "ask
and ye shall receive"?

18:34.907 --> 18:37.910
That part of my life is over.

18:38.118 --> 18:41.371
Maybe we've hit you
in the dome one too many
times, Gabe.

18:41.580 --> 18:42.623
I told you.

18:42.790 --> 18:45.125
Your formula is special.

18:45.334 --> 18:46.877
It'll cure people.

18:47.086 --> 18:48.504
Save souls.

18:49.963 --> 18:51.757
No. No.

18:52.341 --> 18:53.717
No?

18:53.926 --> 18:55.844
Chief, put him down for a nap.

18:58.305 --> 19:01.391
I see you're serving
a five-year sentence
for trafficking.

19:01.600 --> 19:05.229
What would you say
if I told you I could get you
two years shaved off of it?

19:05.437 --> 19:08.232
- In exchange for information.
- I'd say tell me more.

19:08.440 --> 19:13.153
When you were arrested,
you were a low-level associate
in Stacey Boss' crew.

19:13.362 --> 19:16.740
I need everything
you can tell me about
Mr. Boss' crime organization.

19:16.949 --> 19:18.242
No friggin' way.

19:18.450 --> 19:19.993
You could walk out
in six months.

19:20.202 --> 19:22.246
Lady, I said I'm not
interested.

19:22.454 --> 19:25.332
You'd be a free man tomorrow,
and you still
won't tell me anything?

19:25.541 --> 19:29.086
No point in being a free man
if you're a dead man.

19:32.089 --> 19:35.759
So, Lacy poured coffee
on me last night.

19:35.968 --> 19:37.845
And I'm sorry not to have been
more upfront about it.

19:38.053 --> 19:40.430
I just was trying to protect
Lacy's memory.

19:40.639 --> 19:43.225
I told him the right thing
to do was to come in
and tell the truth.

19:43.433 --> 19:45.060
She was in love with Rick.

19:45.269 --> 19:47.271
Tell him.

19:47.479 --> 19:51.275
Sorry. I just got your message
that Rick, here,
turned himself in.

19:51.483 --> 19:54.069
Ms. Moore, you know Rick.
This is his wife, Pamela.

19:54.278 --> 19:56.905
We're just hearing about
how Lacy was in love
with Rick.

19:57.114 --> 19:58.532
Yeah, so, uh...

19:59.992 --> 20:02.286
You know,
last night she, uh...

20:02.494 --> 20:04.079
She kinda
made a move, you know.
And I said,

20:04.288 --> 20:07.124
"Hey, I'm married
and I love my wife."

20:07.332 --> 20:09.376
And she just got super mad.

20:09.543 --> 20:11.879
That's a load of bull corn
and you know it.

20:12.087 --> 20:16.425
Lacy asked you for a cash
advance, and you asked her
for a nasty quid pro quo!

20:16.633 --> 20:19.219
She was standing right in
front of that scuzzy sink
in your office

20:19.428 --> 20:23.932
when you tried affixing
yourself to her backside
like a cheap leather chair.

20:25.017 --> 20:26.018
According to our witness.

20:27.269 --> 20:29.813
You wanna do
yourself a favor, Rick?

20:30.022 --> 20:31.440
Don't lie to us again.

20:33.942 --> 20:35.694
Okay, look. I didn't kill her.

20:35.903 --> 20:37.362
It just... It was a
misunderstanding.

20:37.571 --> 20:39.072
It just was a hug that
went on too long.

20:39.281 --> 20:41.700
You offered her cash
for sex, Rick.

20:41.909 --> 20:43.994
That's what those blisters
on your crotch are about.

20:44.203 --> 20:45.287
What?

20:45.495 --> 20:47.080
- I...
- You...

20:47.289 --> 20:49.541
I'm home, pregnant
with your...

20:49.750 --> 20:50.834
Ow!

20:51.043 --> 20:52.669
- Whoa!
- Honey! Ow!

20:52.878 --> 20:55.255
- Honey! Ow, ow!
- That's right.

20:55.464 --> 20:56.423
Hey, Watson! Some help here!

20:56.632 --> 20:58.008
Get it out, honey!

20:58.217 --> 20:59.843
Hey.

21:00.052 --> 21:03.055
He told me to say
I was his alibi,
but it was a lie!

21:03.263 --> 21:06.683
I don't know where
he was last night. He didn't
come home until midnight!

21:06.892 --> 21:08.518
- He was crazed...
- What are you doing?

21:08.727 --> 21:11.980
Richard Dipalma,
you have the right
to remain silent.

21:12.189 --> 21:15.859
Anything you say
can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

21:22.699 --> 21:25.869
Yeah, I'm looking into a
moving violation for a Phillip
Nelson from two nights ago.

21:26.078 --> 21:27.996
Can you have
the officer who wrote
the ticket give me a call?

21:28.705 --> 21:30.249
Thanks.

21:34.503 --> 21:37.506
Psst! Babineaux.

21:37.714 --> 21:40.259
What's with the guy
burning the scented candle?

21:40.467 --> 21:42.552
Does he think he's
working the front desk
at the day spa?

21:42.761 --> 21:44.304
He claims it centers his chi.

21:44.513 --> 21:47.266
Who brings their chi to work?

21:47.474 --> 21:50.894
Someone's gotta stop that guy.
Strong scents
make me nauseous.

21:51.103 --> 21:54.481
I know people say that,
but if he busts out
a sandalwood, I will puke.

21:54.648 --> 21:56.942
It should smell like
a real police station in here!

21:57.150 --> 21:58.568
Oh, go ask if he has a candle

21:58.777 --> 22:00.654
that smells like hookers
and burned coffee.

22:00.862 --> 22:02.489
Don't think I won't.

22:02.698 --> 22:04.283
So, gimme the dirt.

22:04.491 --> 22:08.912
What do I need
to know to survive
and not piss people off?

22:09.121 --> 22:13.166
That I'm the person who
usually pisses people off, so
you should ask someone else.

22:13.375 --> 22:16.295
No, I knew you were that guy.
I figured you could tell me
what you do

22:16.503 --> 22:19.381
so I could do other stuff.

22:19.589 --> 22:22.843
Okay, at least tell me what
the best food joint is
within walking distance.

22:23.010 --> 22:25.178
- In girl shoes.
- Hands down.

22:25.387 --> 22:27.264
Bob Shanghai's food truck.

22:27.472 --> 22:29.308
Let's go.

22:29.516 --> 22:32.811
Mrs. Dipalma's calmed down.
She's ready to give
her statement.

22:34.271 --> 22:35.605
Rain check?

22:35.814 --> 22:38.692
Okay. But now you're buying.

22:40.527 --> 22:43.030
<i>Mrs. Dipalma.</i>

22:43.238 --> 22:45.532
I just need
your full statement
about last night,

22:45.741 --> 22:48.618
then you and the baby
can get some rest at home.

22:48.827 --> 22:51.830
So, last night I was home
reading until around 9:30.

22:52.039 --> 22:55.125
Rick comes home
shortly after 10:00.
But not last night.

22:55.334 --> 22:58.128
I must've dozed off,
but I woke up when he came in.

22:58.337 --> 22:59.546
Looked at the clock,

22:59.713 --> 23:00.839
it was 12:03.

23:01.048 --> 23:02.799
Did anything strike you
as off about him?

23:03.008 --> 23:04.551
He was just...

23:04.718 --> 23:05.844
Weird?

23:06.053 --> 23:07.346
Anything of note
with his clothes?

23:07.554 --> 23:09.348
No. He wears
the same thing usually.

23:09.556 --> 23:11.683
I mean, Lacy poured
a pot of coffee on his lap.

23:11.892 --> 23:14.686
Oh, yeah! I smelled that
as soon as he walked in.

23:14.895 --> 23:17.522
Did you notice anything
about Rick's shirt?

23:17.731 --> 23:19.149
Like blood?

23:19.358 --> 23:22.152
Come to think of it,
there was blood on his shirt.

23:22.361 --> 23:26.073
I just thought maybe
he broke up a fight at work.

23:26.281 --> 23:28.658
And, uh, how much blood
would you say there was?

23:28.867 --> 23:30.660
Well, enough
to notice, for sure.

23:30.869 --> 23:32.829
Mrs. Dipalma,

23:33.038 --> 23:35.457
Lacy Cantrell was strangled.

23:35.665 --> 23:37.834
There was no blood.

23:38.043 --> 23:41.338
Are you aware that giving
a false report of a crime
is a felony?

23:52.516 --> 23:54.601
This is singer-songwriter
night?

23:54.768 --> 23:58.355
I was thinking more like,
10 people in the audience.

23:58.563 --> 24:01.233
Tuesday night
at The Slow Roll.
Happy hour till last call.

24:01.441 --> 24:03.193
- Your name?
- Olivia Moore.

24:03.402 --> 24:04.778
You're up next, girlie.

24:06.780 --> 24:08.949
Oh, my God. You came!

24:10.367 --> 24:12.536
And you're a cowboy.

24:12.744 --> 24:14.871
You think the mechanical
bull's in a back room
somewhere?

24:16.540 --> 24:18.500
What? What's with the face?

24:18.708 --> 24:21.253
I'm sweatin' like
a 10 dollar whore
on nickel night.

24:21.461 --> 24:22.963
What if my voice cracks?

24:23.130 --> 24:25.298
What if in the middle
of my song some redneck
shouts out,

24:25.507 --> 24:27.884
"Show us your hooters!"
And I go into
full-on zombie mode?

24:28.093 --> 24:29.678
Oh, "if, if, if."

24:29.886 --> 24:32.639
If a bullfrog had wings
it wouldn't bump its bum
when he jumps.

24:34.933 --> 24:38.228
Let's hear it for
Skip McKitrick!

24:38.437 --> 24:42.065
Please give a warm welcome
to a Slow Roll virgin,
Olivia Moore.

24:42.274 --> 24:43.900
Whoo!

24:48.989 --> 24:52.325
Hi, I'm Liv.

24:52.534 --> 24:57.873
This is a song that I wrote
about two people that I have
gotten to know recently.

24:59.416 --> 25:01.543
They love each other,

25:01.751 --> 25:04.880
desperately, but they can't
seem to stop hurting
each other.

25:06.089 --> 25:09.926
<i>♪ So you heard from some folks</i>

25:10.135 --> 25:14.181
<i>♪ That I ain't been true</i>

25:14.389 --> 25:19.144
<i>♪ I guess you still get gossip
in the clink</i>

25:21.605 --> 25:29.029
<i>♪ It happened on one night,
I was full of SoCo and lime</i>

25:29.237 --> 25:36.244
<i>♪ When a pretty boy bought
me a drink</i>

25:36.453 --> 25:44.127
<i>♪ And he said darlin',
you're too pretty to be sad</i>

25:44.336 --> 25:50.842
<i>♪ And I said Mister, I needed
to hear that real bad</i>

25:54.638 --> 25:57.807
<i>- Hey, you've reached
Liv's phone. Leave a message.</i>

25:58.016 --> 26:01.061
Liv, I had to cut Rick loose.
His wife was lying about him
coming home late.

26:01.269 --> 26:02.479
The whole thing.

26:02.687 --> 26:03.855
Uh, excuse me?

26:04.064 --> 26:06.441
I'm sorry.
Uh, my son found this.

26:06.650 --> 26:08.985
- I thought I should
show someone.
- Oh, of course.

26:09.194 --> 26:10.987
Cavanaugh!
Can you help this lady?

26:11.196 --> 26:12.113
Yeah.

26:14.157 --> 26:17.452
On another front, Sue,
the ex-con/ex-boyfriend?

26:17.661 --> 26:19.412
His alibi evaporated.

26:19.621 --> 26:21.790
His buddy Phil was
getting ticketed for
speeding in Issaquah

26:21.998 --> 26:23.250
when they were supposed
to be together.

26:23.458 --> 26:28.296
<i>♪ There's only
nightmares ahead of us</i>

26:28.505 --> 26:31.675
<i>♪ And sweet dreams long ago</i>

26:31.883 --> 26:35.512
<i>♪ It's time to wake up, baby</i>

26:35.720 --> 26:41.393
<i>♪ It's time I let you go</i>

26:43.353 --> 26:50.151
<i>♪ I've got to let you go ♪</i>

26:57.867 --> 26:59.035
Ow!

26:59.244 --> 27:00.161
Thank you.

27:02.247 --> 27:04.374
Keep it going
for Olivia Moore!

27:04.583 --> 27:06.626
...take a little break.
So, we'll see you back here
in about ten minutes.

27:06.835 --> 27:08.461
That was amazing!

27:10.088 --> 27:12.048
What do you feel right now?

27:12.257 --> 27:14.467
Clarity.
I have to go see Major.

27:15.427 --> 27:17.262
Oh, but...

27:17.470 --> 27:18.388
You're gonna miss me
trying to convince
one of these lovelies

27:18.597 --> 27:20.599
to play Cowgirl and Indian.

27:36.448 --> 27:40.160
Hey. I just wanted to tell you
that was some
good playin' in there.

27:40.368 --> 27:42.120
Oh.

27:42.329 --> 27:44.372
- Thank you.
- 'Course.

27:45.081 --> 27:46.791
Goodnight.

27:47.000 --> 27:48.627
I liked your song.

27:51.796 --> 27:54.215
I think Lacy
would've liked it, too.

27:56.801 --> 28:01.139
Growin' up, my dad used
to tell me, "Son, you could
screw up a steel ball."

28:02.432 --> 28:04.267
I did that with Lacy.

28:06.561 --> 28:08.229
I loved that girl.

28:10.190 --> 28:12.150
Love ain't always enough.

28:20.909 --> 28:24.245
<i>Seven days and
still no sign of a missing
Bellevue man.</i>

28:24.454 --> 28:28.249
<i>Thirty-three-year-old tech
entrepreneur Colin Andrews,
was last seen</i>

28:28.458 --> 28:30.877
<i>Wednesday evening,
when he told his brother</i>

28:31.086 --> 28:33.963
<i>he was going for a run
in Seward Park with his dog.</i>

28:39.469 --> 28:40.720
Hey.

28:41.596 --> 28:43.348
Twice in a week.

28:43.556 --> 28:45.975
I'm sorry.
I know you want space.

28:46.184 --> 28:48.812
But that's kind of why
I'm here.

28:49.020 --> 28:51.606
I realized something tonight.

28:51.815 --> 28:53.608
I just need to say it.

28:54.401 --> 28:55.527
Okay.

28:58.029 --> 29:01.908
From the moment
that I met you I knew we were
meant to be together.

29:02.117 --> 29:06.329
I was sure of it.
It was like fate.

29:06.538 --> 29:09.999
But that was before
I'd witnessed a mass murder.

29:10.208 --> 29:13.420
Before I'd eaten fresh brain,

29:13.628 --> 29:17.841
before I'd lied to you,
or let you put yourself
in a mental hospital.

29:19.801 --> 29:21.845
It was before
I watched you die.

29:22.053 --> 29:27.058
And it was before all
this cruelty was directed
back at me.

29:27.267 --> 29:30.895
Now, I don't think that
space can fix what's
wrong with us.

29:32.522 --> 29:34.315
We're a dream that's dead.

29:37.444 --> 29:40.321
I doubt that I will ever stop
loving you,

29:42.699 --> 29:44.576
but it's over now.

29:45.827 --> 29:47.495
I gotta let you go.

29:48.997 --> 29:50.457
Completely.

29:51.958 --> 29:53.251
Forever.

29:56.379 --> 29:57.881
Perfect.

29:58.089 --> 29:59.924
Thanks for stopping by.

30:16.524 --> 30:19.110
Hey! Stop!

30:19.319 --> 30:22.405
I'm coming here like an adult,
trying to talk to you.

30:22.614 --> 30:23.782
How can you be
this cold to me?

30:23.990 --> 30:25.742
Who exactly
am I being cold to?

30:25.950 --> 30:27.744
Huh? Whose brain
did you eat this week?

30:27.952 --> 30:30.288
Oh, this is all me!

30:30.497 --> 30:33.583
And in case you've forgotten,
I didn't ask for this.

30:33.792 --> 30:36.294
I went to a party because
you told me I should.

30:36.503 --> 30:39.464
I woke up on a shore
craving brains.

30:39.672 --> 30:42.509
And next thing I know, I've
cracked this corpse's head
open...

30:42.717 --> 30:44.385
How could I
bring that home to you?

30:44.594 --> 30:48.807
How could I be your wife?
I had become a monster.

30:49.015 --> 30:52.769
And I was confused,
and I was dangerous.

30:52.977 --> 30:55.396
Every decision
that I made last year,

30:55.605 --> 30:59.692
I made trying to protect
you from my new reality.

30:59.901 --> 31:05.406
I know that in your eyes
I screwed up badly
somewhere along the line.

31:05.615 --> 31:07.575
But I did the best I could.

31:09.369 --> 31:11.579
You know, I just...

31:11.788 --> 31:14.457
I keep asking you
for some space,

31:14.666 --> 31:19.128
and every time I turn around,
here you are.

31:31.516 --> 31:33.268
Why are you doing this?

31:34.185 --> 31:36.437
Doing what?

31:36.646 --> 31:40.525
Making me doubt the only
thing in my life that
I was sure was real.

31:57.834 --> 31:59.377
Major.

32:00.753 --> 32:01.963
Major!

32:03.006 --> 32:04.507
Where's the dog?

32:04.716 --> 32:06.676
Uh, he was just right here.

32:06.885 --> 32:09.512
Well, the back door's
wide open and he's not
here now.

32:09.721 --> 32:12.307
I even shook his bag
of snick snacks and still,
no dog.

32:12.515 --> 32:15.184
Yeah. He'll be back.
He's uh... Probably just...

32:15.393 --> 32:18.313
What? Down at
the corner bodega
picking up some munchies?

32:18.521 --> 32:21.316
Well, let's go!
We need to find the dog!

32:28.865 --> 32:30.575
Yeah, okay.
Jesus rose from the dead.

32:30.783 --> 32:33.494
That doesn't make him a zombie
if he doesn't eat brains.

32:37.624 --> 32:40.418
Dude, that body
of Christ stuff, that was
for his disciples to eat.

32:40.627 --> 32:44.380
I don't know what you qualify
as when you make other people
eat you.

32:44.589 --> 32:46.215
Narcissistic.

32:46.424 --> 32:49.385
Let's check in on
our man of the cloth
before I head out, huh?

32:53.097 --> 32:56.601
And on the second day,
he shared the
Utopium recipe, right?

32:59.479 --> 33:01.230
I'll die first.

33:01.439 --> 33:04.651
I'll tell you what.
I'll get you halfway there.

33:04.859 --> 33:06.027
Chief?

33:07.195 --> 33:08.321
What?

33:11.032 --> 33:12.325
No! No!

33:16.537 --> 33:18.331
Wait! Wait!

33:18.539 --> 33:21.042
No! Wait a second!

33:21.250 --> 33:23.753
He's gonna be a fresh,
angry zombie soon.

33:23.962 --> 33:26.422
You'll want to use
a few more screws.

33:29.759 --> 33:33.513
So, uh... It says here
you were slinging for
Stacey Boss.

33:33.680 --> 33:37.767
But are now a local
business owner.

33:37.976 --> 33:40.436
So, seeing as you're
not serving time,
have everything to lose

33:40.645 --> 33:43.231
and nothing to gain,
I don't know what
to offer you.

33:43.439 --> 33:45.108
Except,

33:45.316 --> 33:47.402
the peace of mind you'd have
serving your community

33:47.610 --> 33:50.905
if you told me anything
you know about Stacey Boss.

33:51.114 --> 33:52.657
Peace of mind.

33:52.865 --> 33:54.951
Can't put a price tag on that.

33:58.204 --> 34:00.915
Stacey imports his Utopium
from Hong Kong.

34:01.124 --> 34:03.292
It's hidden in shipments
of scrap copper.

34:03.501 --> 34:05.920
The shipments come
bimonthly into a port
at Terminal 18.

34:06.129 --> 34:08.631
And in regards to what
you can offer me?

34:08.840 --> 34:11.759
I would like to discuss
immunity for the crimes
I'm about to admit to.

34:13.845 --> 34:17.515
So, Jiang Jin is Boss'
lieutenant,

34:17.724 --> 34:19.934
and specifically, he's
the gatekeeper for Hong Kong.

34:20.143 --> 34:23.479
But with Jiang and his son AJ
both in prison, then
who's running the Jin empire?

34:23.688 --> 34:25.440
That, I don't know.

34:25.648 --> 34:27.817
But if Jin's operation was
in some way compromised,

34:28.026 --> 34:30.403
Boss' supply out of Hong Kong
would be compromised.

34:30.611 --> 34:33.906
You are really saving
my ass here.

34:34.115 --> 34:36.325
You'll tell the press that
it was my savvy interrogation

34:36.534 --> 34:37.618
that got you
to cooperate, right?

34:40.079 --> 34:43.499
"She exuded a power that
compelled me to talk.
I was helpless to resist."

34:47.336 --> 34:48.713
You sure you
don't want anything?

34:48.921 --> 34:49.881
Wine is all I need.

34:50.715 --> 34:53.342
What was I saying?

34:53.551 --> 34:56.554
- You went all hell
hath no fury on Major.
- Yeah.

34:56.763 --> 34:58.681
Something snapped in me.

34:58.890 --> 35:00.516
I unloaded on him.

35:00.725 --> 35:03.019
I was just tired
of living in the doghouse,
you know?

35:03.227 --> 35:05.688
No, I get it, it's time.

35:05.897 --> 35:08.983
But for what it's worth,
the guy walking around
claiming to be Major

35:09.192 --> 35:11.611
doesn't seem at all like
the Major I remember.

35:13.279 --> 35:14.280
Gilda!

35:14.489 --> 35:15.865
- Hi.
- Want some Tom Yum soup?

35:16.074 --> 35:18.117
I ordered it extra-spicy.

35:18.326 --> 35:22.914
Thanks, but, uh, new diet.
No eating after 6:00.

35:23.122 --> 35:26.084
Unless it's a whisky sour.

35:26.292 --> 35:29.212
I don't know about
this Gilda chick, with the

35:29.420 --> 35:32.298
legs and the hair,
and the hard liquor dinners.

35:32.507 --> 35:35.927
- Think maybe a background
check is in order.
- Ooh, I like you jealous.

35:36.135 --> 35:37.970
Keeps you from
phoning it in with me.

35:38.179 --> 35:40.765
Or focusing too much
of your energy on boys.

35:40.973 --> 35:42.558
Yuck. Boys.

35:42.767 --> 35:45.561
Not to worry.
I'm currently a free agent.

35:45.770 --> 35:48.523
Actually, I met someone
interesting at work today.

35:49.899 --> 35:51.359
I think you'd like him.

35:56.823 --> 35:58.741
He is risen.

35:58.950 --> 36:00.576
You feeling peckish?

36:00.785 --> 36:01.702
Hmm?

36:03.663 --> 36:05.123
Oh.

36:05.331 --> 36:06.624
Oh, oh, oh.

36:09.001 --> 36:10.545
Nice work, Chief.

36:14.423 --> 36:16.467
Last chance, Preach.

36:16.676 --> 36:20.096
Tell me what you cut
the Utopium with, and I will
feed you and cure you.

36:20.304 --> 36:23.599
You give me what I want
and you shall be healed!

36:26.102 --> 36:28.020
God is testing me.

36:28.229 --> 36:29.689
Right.

36:30.940 --> 36:33.860
Out! Foul demon!

36:36.195 --> 36:38.281
Enjoy your 40 days
in the wilderness.

36:38.489 --> 36:40.992
Come back when you have
a different answer for me.

36:55.131 --> 36:57.049
Hey!

36:57.216 --> 36:59.260
I didn't listen
to your voicemail about Sue
until this morning.

36:59.468 --> 37:01.804
I actually ran into him
last night at The Slow Roll.

37:02.013 --> 37:05.016
- You what?
- I think Sue's just
a prickly pear.

37:05.224 --> 37:08.477
Soft and sweet on the inside?
I don't see him killing Lacy.

37:08.686 --> 37:12.565
- You were out
working the case?
- I was on stage. Singing.

37:12.773 --> 37:15.693
- And Sue was a gentleman.
- He lied about his alibi, Liv.

37:15.902 --> 37:17.486
I mean, I can't...

37:20.698 --> 37:22.158
Oh, someone hit big
on the scratch-off?

37:22.366 --> 37:24.785
No, that lady who came
in last night?

37:24.994 --> 37:27.914
Brought in the gun
from that convenience store
job in Queen Anne.

37:28.122 --> 37:30.082
Ballistics just confirmed it.

37:30.291 --> 37:33.544
She said her kid found it
in some bushes up by
Evergreen Manor?

37:33.753 --> 37:35.421
- Congrats.
- Thanks.

37:37.298 --> 37:39.634
Wait a sec.

37:39.842 --> 37:41.177
Where'd you say
the kid found it?

37:45.723 --> 37:47.391
Thank God.

37:47.600 --> 37:48.601
Where'd you find him?

37:48.809 --> 37:50.394
On a lost pet message board.

37:50.603 --> 37:52.188
A jogger found him
wandering around a
park, posted a...

37:52.396 --> 37:56.525
- Which park?
- Uh... Seward Park.

37:56.734 --> 37:59.153
I mean, why does that matter?

37:59.362 --> 38:02.156
No, uh... It doesn't, I guess.
I, uh...

38:02.365 --> 38:03.741
Not in the grand scheme.

38:03.950 --> 38:06.160
What is going on
with you, man?

38:06.369 --> 38:08.746
When I came in yesterday,
you couldn't respond
to your own name,

38:08.955 --> 38:11.165
you couldn't remember
when you'd last seen Minor.

38:11.374 --> 38:14.001
I'm starting to wonder whether
you can take care of yourself,
let alone an animal.

38:14.210 --> 38:17.421
Look, it was just
a bad day is all. All right?
I'll get myself together.

38:17.630 --> 38:20.091
Cool. You do that. Oh.

38:20.299 --> 38:22.885
Next time you decide
to invite an ex of mine
to live with us,

38:23.094 --> 38:24.679
give us a heads up first,
will you?

38:24.887 --> 38:25.972
Cheers.

38:26.180 --> 38:27.598
Come on, Minor.

38:38.484 --> 38:40.361
Looking to score a couple
of U bombs.

38:42.822 --> 38:43.781
Major?

38:47.326 --> 38:50.579
Yo, Stubs! Get me a coupla
brain busters on the house
for this cat.

38:50.788 --> 38:53.249
We go way back
to Helton Shelter.

38:53.457 --> 38:56.711
This dude was trying
to keep us off drugs!

38:59.880 --> 39:02.133
Privilege drop, bro!

39:26.365 --> 39:30.328
After you shot
the Sack & Pack clerk in
Queen Anne, you were on foot.

39:30.536 --> 39:32.079
You made it all the
way to Evergreen Manor,

39:32.288 --> 39:34.457
where you ditched
the gun in some bushes.

39:34.665 --> 39:37.418
Police choppers were
in the air with spotlights so,

39:37.626 --> 39:41.047
you ducked into the
first unlocked house
you could find.

39:42.673 --> 39:44.967
Lacy Cantrell's.

39:45.176 --> 39:47.887
She comes home,
so you hide in her closet.

39:48.095 --> 39:50.598
My guess is she
heard something,

39:50.806 --> 39:53.726
went to check it out,
and discovered you.

39:53.934 --> 39:56.437
You panicked
and choked her to death.

39:56.645 --> 39:59.440
We found pantyhose on
her closet floor,

39:59.648 --> 40:02.693
the same ones you wore
on your head in the robbery.

40:02.902 --> 40:05.237
Your DNA's gonna be
all over them.

40:05.446 --> 40:07.531
You already confessed
to one murder.

40:07.740 --> 40:11.577
Do a good thing
and give Lacy's family
some closure.

40:16.123 --> 40:19.794
So, that's it? Lacy was
just in the wrong place
at the wrong time?

40:20.544 --> 40:22.296
It happens.

40:22.505 --> 40:25.925
Try not to dwell on it.
It'll make you crazy.

40:34.266 --> 40:36.560
<i>Yeah, no kidding
it'll make you crazy.</i>

40:39.105 --> 40:41.982
<i>You spend your life
in a comfortable dream state
believing in destiny.</i>

40:42.191 --> 40:45.444
<i>Then reality snaps you awake
like a kick in the teeth.</i>

40:45.653 --> 40:48.030
<i>Bad things happen as often
as good things.</i>

40:48.239 --> 40:50.950
<i>People who think they're meant
to be together, aren't.</i>

40:51.158 --> 40:54.120
<i>Turns out we're nothing
more than chemicals
hurtling through space,</i>

40:54.328 --> 40:56.080
<i>haphazardly bouncing
off each other.</i>

40:58.124 --> 41:01.377
<i>Feeling stupid we
ever believed there was
some grand plan.</i>

41:06.841 --> 41:08.300
I need help.
