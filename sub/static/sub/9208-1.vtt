- Good. Are you on?
- Yeah, we're ready.

01:01.187 --> 01:03.188
<i>My name is Calvin Cutler.</i>

01:03.189 --> 01:06.066
What you're about to witness
is the most badass,

01:06.067 --> 01:08.236
fucked-up thing you'll ever see.

01:08.319 --> 01:10.446
We call this the "Bull's Eye."

01:11.573 --> 01:14.325
Oh, yeah.
Don't try this at home.

01:15.243 --> 01:18.371
You're good? You ready, buddy?
All right. Right, ready?

01:19.372 --> 01:22.500
One... two... three!

01:26.254 --> 01:27.294
Tell me we got it. Just...

01:28.381 --> 01:32.301
Did we? No! No way, we got it!
No fucking way, dude!

01:32.302 --> 01:34.219
<i>We got it! We got it! We got...</i>
- Oh, shit!

01:34.220 --> 01:36.556
<i>Look at that! Look at that!
Dude. Bull's eye, bro!</i>

01:39.392 --> 01:41.393
Awesome!

01:41.394 --> 01:44.105
<i>We're putting it on YouTube!
Let's go! Yeah!</i>

01:44.272 --> 01:45.398
Dude, we got a view!

01:47.400 --> 01:49.485
Yeah, buddy, that was us
when we uploaded it.

01:50.403 --> 01:53.281
Well, then upload it again
so we can have two views.

01:53.531 --> 01:55.283
I... I don't think that's how it works.

01:55.366 --> 01:57.660
- Hit "refresh," dude.
- Oh, yeah.

02:01.289 --> 02:03.373
- No way.
- That can't be right.

02:03.374 --> 02:04.666
- Do me a favor.
- I just refreshed it.

02:04.667 --> 02:06.085
Let's see if it pulls up.

02:06.336 --> 02:10.673
No way. Twenty-five thousand
views, man!

02:12.050 --> 02:13.301
Five hundred thousand!

02:14.218 --> 02:16.387
- One million? Yes!
- You're too money!

02:16.512 --> 02:19.306
- I told you we're gonna be famous.
- We're gonna be famous and...

02:19.307 --> 02:21.309
<i>April fools, suckers!</i>

02:22.226 --> 02:26.229
<i>I took the liberty of cloning YouTube
and hyper-inflating your views.</i>

02:26.230 --> 02:27.690
...You... You little shit!

02:28.107 --> 02:30.692
<i>Did you just try to hit me
through your computer screen?</i>

02:30.693 --> 02:31.777
Yeah, I did!

02:31.778 --> 02:34.404
Why don't you come in here so
I can hit you like a real man, pussy!

02:34.405 --> 02:37.492
<i>Working on my science project.
Enjoy your page views.</i>

02:37.700 --> 02:39.410
God, he's such a little spaz!

02:39.702 --> 02:42.079
- We need revenge.
- We do.

02:42.080 --> 02:45.248
- We need to April fools prank him.
- Yeah!

02:45.249 --> 02:47.334
- Hit him where it hurts.
- Square in his balls.

02:47.335 --> 02:49.127
No! We gotta do
something better.

02:49.128 --> 02:52.340
We steal his computer
and load it full of viruses.

02:52.423 --> 02:55.342
- Wait, where do we get viruses?
- Uh, duh! Porn sites.

02:55.343 --> 02:58.346
Why do you think my computer's
so slow? It's full of 'em.

02:58.429 --> 03:01.348
Oh, okay, but how-how do we get
his laptop if it's in his room?

03:01.349 --> 03:03.642
We can't just-just kick
in the door and steal it.

03:03.643 --> 03:06.436
How do you lure a dragon
out of a lion's den?

03:06.437 --> 03:07.438
I don't know.

03:08.356 --> 03:10.649
- You present him with a challenge.
- Challenge?

03:10.650 --> 03:12.527
A challenge. Jus... Follow my lead.

03:13.152 --> 03:16.447
- Baxter! Baxter, my man!
<i>- What?</i>

03:17.115 --> 03:20.576
Uh, me and J.J., we have
this computer problem.

03:21.160 --> 03:25.581
There's this movie on
the Internet and we can't find it.

03:26.124 --> 03:27.165
Can you help us?

03:27.166 --> 03:29.460
You're trying to get back
at me for that prank, right?

03:29.544 --> 03:33.588
No! Truce! Truce.
Seriously, we just, uh...

03:33.589 --> 03:38.970
we need to find it, uh,
before the FBI takes it down.

03:39.387 --> 03:40.470
<i>You said the FBI?</i>

03:40.471 --> 03:44.558
- Fucking FBI, the CIA...
- The CSI, NCIS...

03:44.559 --> 03:46.601
I mean, this video is so illegal,

03:46.602 --> 03:49.313
it has been banned
by every country in the world.

03:49.397 --> 03:50.480
Including Amsterdam.

03:50.481 --> 03:52.607
Where you could slap a cop
in the face with your penis,

03:52.608 --> 03:54.067
and they'd say, "danka."

03:54.068 --> 03:55.695
<i>Amsterdam is not a country!</i>

03:56.237 --> 03:58.405
- Amsterdam's not a country?
- Since when?

03:58.406 --> 04:00.490
The shit's still banned there, dude.

04:00.491 --> 04:03.692
Yeah. Think about it. They... it's...
it's like it's the... the... the fucking...

04:03.786 --> 04:06.413
It's the most dangerous
film in the world.

04:06.414 --> 04:07.707
- It is.
- What's it called?

04:10.334 --> 04:13.420
Actually, you know what,
Baxter? You're right.

04:13.421 --> 04:15.214
It was an April Fool's prank.

04:15.506 --> 04:17.591
I'm sorry we brought you into this.

04:17.591 --> 04:19.593
You know, you should probably just...

04:19.594 --> 04:22.721
go on with your life and never
think about this again. Please.

04:22.722 --> 04:23.765
Wait.

04:24.599 --> 04:27.434
- What's so bad about it?
- You don't wanna know.

04:27.435 --> 04:28.770
What's so bad about it?

04:30.229 --> 04:33.523
Hey, slim!
What's so bad about it?

04:33.524 --> 04:35.359
- It can kill you.
- How?

04:35.777 --> 04:38.445
It can make you shit out
your intestines.

04:38.446 --> 04:40.363
It can make you bleed
out of your eyes.

04:40.364 --> 04:42.199
You know, one guy saw it,

04:42.200 --> 04:45.327
and he ran into a church, and
he just started humping the nuns.

04:45.328 --> 04:47.329
That was a huge story
a few years back.

04:47.330 --> 04:49.206
It can make you pull off
your own dick.

04:49.207 --> 04:50.791
Okay, why would you
want to watch it...

04:50.792 --> 04:52.334
if it can make you pull off
your own dick?

04:52.335 --> 04:53.461
Because...

04:53.628 --> 04:58.132
If you can watch it all the way
through from the beginning to end,

04:58.508 --> 05:02.261
you're rewarded beyond
your wildest dreams.

05:03.346 --> 05:07.475
With money. And sex.
And women.

05:08.267 --> 05:11.395
It's like that movie The Ring,
but with a good ending.

05:11.521 --> 05:14.398
- Yeah. And boobs.
- Lots of boobs.

05:14.649 --> 05:17.109
So what's this movie called?

05:19.237 --> 05:20.404
<i>Movie.</i>

05:21.364 --> 05:23.533
<i>- Forty-three.
- Movie forty-three.</i>

05:27.245 --> 05:28.412
It's not on Zwoogle.

05:29.372 --> 05:31.791
Yeah, of course it's not
on Zwoogle. It's banned!

05:32.667 --> 05:35.335
Okay. Then I guess
we'll need to dig deeper.

05:35.336 --> 05:37.547
Visit some dark corners
of the Internet.

05:37.588 --> 05:40.549
Mm, yeah, the dark
corners, dude.

05:40.550 --> 05:42.385
Yeah, get in there.
We gotta find this thing.

05:43.135 --> 05:45.512
I found a cloaked server
that houses banned videos.

05:45.513 --> 05:48.515
Start out with the forty-third one
on the list. Sound good?

05:48.516 --> 05:51.142
Yes! Yeah, you guys keep
working on this.

05:51.143 --> 05:54.688
I'm gonna go guard the door
for the uh, FBI,

05:54.689 --> 05:56.691
the CIA, and Mom.

05:57.567 --> 05:59.318
Look at this. Check it out.

06:00.736 --> 06:03.447
Hey. Ooh! You look good.

06:03.573 --> 06:05.740
Hope you're almost ready.
He's gonna be here any second.

06:05.741 --> 06:08.577
I don't know why I'm doing this,
Pam. I don't trust Julie.

06:08.578 --> 06:12.205
- I mean, what if this guy's a loser?
- He's not a loser.

06:12.206 --> 06:14.124
He made senior partner at his law
firm by the time he was,

06:14.125 --> 06:15.209
like, twenty-eight.

06:15.334 --> 06:17.587
So all he cares about is
his career and money.

06:18.337 --> 06:21.590
Mm, not according to Julie. He's a
volunteer with the Special Olympics,

06:21.591 --> 06:23.551
he's on the board of
the New York Philharmonic...

06:23.634 --> 06:25.720
He's opening a new restaurant
with Derek Jeter!

06:26.137 --> 06:28.763
But he's probably got one of those
awkward character faces...

06:28.764 --> 06:31.350
that sort of really has
to grow on you, right?

06:32.602 --> 06:36.355
Mr. "Character Face" is on
the cover of Gotham Magazine.

06:37.607 --> 06:39.567
- That's him?
- That's him.

06:42.486 --> 06:43.571
Yeah.

06:47.366 --> 06:48.491
And he's here. Go.

06:48.492 --> 06:50.076
- Do I look okay?
- Gorgeous.

06:50.077 --> 06:51.328
- You sure?
- Have fun!

06:51.329 --> 06:52.455
<i>Bye!</i>

06:57.376 --> 06:58.752
- I mean, you gotta be kidding.
- Several of them.

06:58.753 --> 07:02.088
I'm telling you, don't knock
shopping on TV until you've tried it.

07:02.089 --> 07:03.757
Beth, I think-I think you're
the first person I've ever met...

07:03.758 --> 07:05.175
who actually buys
stuff off television.

07:05.176 --> 07:06.376
- No! Come on!
- No, it's true.

07:06.510 --> 07:08.511
Oh, well where do you think
I got this scarf?

07:08.512 --> 07:11.389
And you know what?
I bet it's softer than yours.

07:11.390 --> 07:13.266
Okay. See, that's where
I draw the line.

07:13.267 --> 07:15.101
Do not start putting down the scarf.

07:15.102 --> 07:17.604
Here. Feel this. One-hundred
percent pashmina.

07:17.605 --> 07:19.773
Well, at least that's what
the guy on the street told me.

07:19.774 --> 07:22.692
Come on, then. Wow, that is soft.
Well, you know, I...

07:22.693 --> 07:25.488
Hey, Mr. H. Table's ready, sir.

07:25.613 --> 07:26.656
Great.

07:27.114 --> 07:28.532
- I'll take those.
- Thank you.

07:29.116 --> 07:30.283
- Please.
- Our table's ready.

07:30.284 --> 07:31.285
Thank you.

07:31.410 --> 07:32.495
After you.

07:35.498 --> 07:40.419
So, um, Carrie tells me you design
clothes for kids. No?

07:40.544 --> 07:42.672
Yes. Clothes for kids. I design...

07:43.631 --> 07:46.383
clothes... for kids. Kids clothes.

07:46.384 --> 07:47.676
Awesome. Awesome.

07:47.677 --> 07:51.722
So, if I see some kids looking weird
this summer, it may be your fault, huh?

07:53.516 --> 07:55.142
I'm just joking. I'm just joking.

07:55.726 --> 07:58.103
Your Russian Standard Vodka, sir.

07:58.104 --> 07:59.689
Am I that predictable, Abby?

08:01.691 --> 08:03.525
Eh... Yeah, you good with that? Or would
you prefer a glass of wine or...?

08:03.526 --> 08:07.530
No. No, I... I could, use it.

08:07.571 --> 08:08.698
Thank you.

08:11.283 --> 08:14.328
So, here's to a, Here's to
a wonderful evening. Cheers.

08:16.122 --> 08:17.456
Cheers.

08:22.003 --> 08:23.546
Those Russians know something.

08:26.549 --> 08:29.593
This is... a nice place.

08:29.719 --> 08:32.722
Oh, it's great. This pl...
Oh, you gotta check out the ceiling.

08:32.804 --> 08:34.722
Those beams were taken out...

08:34.724 --> 08:37.308
of this old Quaker meetinghouse
out in rural Pennsylvania.

08:37.308 --> 08:41.731
I mean, look. It's all oak. Isn't
that something? It's gorgeous, huh?

08:42.523 --> 08:43.732
Oh, wow, Jake. What's this?

08:43.732 --> 08:48.737
Well, Mr. H, this is a vichyssoise
courtesy of Chef Billy.

08:48.738 --> 08:50.655
Now, he heard that you guys
were coming in tonight,

08:50.656 --> 08:53.408
so he's put together a special
four-course meal for you.

08:53.409 --> 08:54.744
Lobster okay tonight?

08:55.077 --> 08:57.203
That's okay with me
if it's okay with you,

08:57.204 --> 08:58.998
un-unless you wanna
check out the menu.

08:59.248 --> 09:01.541
Beth? Unless you wanna
check out the menu, or...?

09:01.542 --> 09:03.502
- No, that's sounds lovely.
- Right.

09:04.336 --> 09:05.336
Terrific.

09:05.337 --> 09:07.548
Please thank the chef.
Thank you.

09:08.257 --> 09:09.467
<i>Bon Appétit.</i>

09:13.637 --> 09:16.766
Oh, you've, got something on your...

09:17.349 --> 09:20.770
Something on my neck? Leave it to me
to embarrass myself on a first date.

09:23.272 --> 09:24.356
Here...

09:24.774 --> 09:26.649
There? There? I got it?

09:26.650 --> 09:30.236
A little bit... bit more on-on
the left b... ball... One.

09:30.237 --> 09:33.157
Uh, left side. Of...
Dribbly bit.

09:36.702 --> 09:41.039
Thanks. I mean, no biggie. Trust me,
I've been through worse. I mean, as...

09:41.040 --> 09:44.460
As a kid, I used to get made
fun of all the time.

09:44.502 --> 09:47.128
Was it, because of your...

09:47.129 --> 09:49.672
My stutter. I... I used to have
a really bad stutter.

09:49.673 --> 09:53.385
Actually took probably nine years of
speech therapy to get rid of it.

10:03.687 --> 10:09.276
So, was there anything else they...
may have made fun of?

10:11.570 --> 10:14.030
- I don't know.
- Anything at all?

10:14.031 --> 10:17.158
Oh, yeah, some kids used to talk
a little smack about my neck.

10:17.159 --> 10:19.203
- You know.
- Oh, thank God!

10:20.079 --> 10:23.082
- What's up?
- I thought I was going crazy. I...

10:23.207 --> 10:24.291
What?

10:24.500 --> 10:28.711
I mean... not a big deal...
at all.

10:28.712 --> 10:33.050
It's just, what is the story there?

10:34.969 --> 10:38.555
Well, when I was six, I fell off my bike
and I landed on a sprinkler head...

10:38.556 --> 10:41.099
and they had to stitch me up
at the hospital.

10:41.100 --> 10:43.561
See, it's, it's just a scar. Right?

10:44.061 --> 10:47.189
I mean, kids could be mean.
They used to call me Frankenstein.

10:48.440 --> 10:52.611
They're like,
"He's alive. He's alive!"

10:55.531 --> 10:58.325
Well, I don't care, you know.
Kids make fun of everything, right?

10:59.577 --> 11:02.538
Is it just me or did it suddenly
get a little chilly in here?

11:05.749 --> 11:07.334
I think it may be that vent there.

11:09.336 --> 11:12.088
- Here we are.
- Man! Look at the size of those things.

11:12.089 --> 11:15.091
Oh, Jake, buddy, would you mind
turning up the heat just a tad?

11:15.092 --> 11:17.452
I think that, that vent's blowing
right on... not a problem.

11:18.095 --> 11:19.137
Thank you.

11:19.138 --> 11:20.471
And, uh, just let me go ahead and...

11:20.472 --> 11:22.765
- Sure.
- Get this out of your way here.

11:22.766 --> 11:24.268
Oh, God! Are you... Are you okay?

11:26.145 --> 11:27.771
It's my stomach. There's...

11:30.024 --> 11:31.609
Just get my breath back, you know.

11:33.569 --> 11:35.486
There he is! There's the stud!

11:35.487 --> 11:37.156
Hey! Angie! Ray!

11:37.364 --> 11:39.032
Hey, how the hell are you guys?
You're good?

11:39.033 --> 11:40.701
Apparently not as good as you.

11:41.035 --> 11:43.578
Hi, I'm Angie and this is
my husband Ray.

11:43.579 --> 11:46.372
- Hi.
- This is my new friend, Beth.

11:46.373 --> 11:48.583
She's slowly restoring
my faith in blind dates.

11:48.584 --> 11:50.126
Well, kudos to you, Beth,

11:50.127 --> 11:52.253
for getting this old workaholic
out of his office for once.

11:52.254 --> 11:53.714
Come on. Come on, Ray.

11:53.797 --> 11:57.051
Nice work!
You caught the big one!

11:57.134 --> 11:58.177
Did I?

11:59.637 --> 12:01.054
But... Do you not notice the...

12:01.055 --> 12:04.433
- Look how big little Evan's getting!
- Yeah. Little?

12:04.725 --> 12:07.269
Yeah. He's growing like crazy.

12:08.812 --> 12:10.397
- No.
- Who's a big boy?

12:10.689 --> 12:13.609
Who's a big boy, huh?

12:14.068 --> 12:17.070
Wow, Ray, he's a monster. You got
yourself a little linebacker here.

12:17.071 --> 12:19.405
A little linebacker that needs
to go to bed!

12:19.406 --> 12:21.700
Okay. You're off to bed.
There you go.

12:22.701 --> 12:25.620
- Fumble.
- Another pacifier down.

12:25.621 --> 12:26.747
I got it.

12:28.082 --> 12:29.750
Thanks, buddy. Thanks bud.

12:30.292 --> 12:31.626
Here, bud. Angie?

12:31.627 --> 12:33.169
You guys look so cute.
I gotta take a picture.

12:33.170 --> 12:34.213
Really?

12:35.089 --> 12:37.173
- Angie, please.
- Hey, let-let the man eat, honey.

12:37.174 --> 12:39.550
Come on, Ray. We have a picture
of our first date.

12:39.551 --> 12:41.427
They should have a picture of theirs.

12:41.428 --> 12:45.306
Come on, get your fanny over there
behind her and don't be shy.

12:45.307 --> 12:48.643
- All right. Okay, okay. All right.
- Okay.

12:48.644 --> 12:50.479
- I'm sorry about this.
- Get in close.

12:50.688 --> 12:53.190
Beth, I'm gonna need
you to hold still.

12:53.315 --> 12:55.191
Oh, God, they look so...

12:55.192 --> 12:58.111
Get down! Get your face down
next to hers! Come on!

12:58.112 --> 13:00.322
Take it. Take it. Take it, take it,
take it, take it.

13:00.739 --> 13:02.992
- So good!
- How's that?

13:04.118 --> 13:05.702
Now why don't you give
each other a little kiss?

13:05.703 --> 13:07.120
Oh, come on.
Angie, we just met.

13:07.121 --> 13:09.205
Come on, let 'em eat!
Let the man eat!

13:09.206 --> 13:10.999
- Come on! Just a little kiss.
- All right, all right.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.459
We'll do one, one kiss
on the forehead.

13:13.460 --> 13:14.460
- One peck on the forehead.
- We don't need to.

13:14.461 --> 13:15.712
- Ready? Okay.
- We really don't.

13:15.713 --> 13:17.089
We don't need...

13:19.341 --> 13:22.469
The fuck, man! Keep looking.

13:25.139 --> 13:27.474
Let's try the forty-second one.

13:28.100 --> 13:29.101
Yeah, yeah, good idea.

13:33.480 --> 13:35.024
Boobs.

13:37.151 --> 13:39.486
Pornography with viruses.

13:41.113 --> 13:43.157
Yeah, Baxter, you're going down.

13:43.699 --> 13:45.117
Keep looking.

13:52.166 --> 13:54.542
It's uh, roast Sumatra.
I grind the beans myself.

13:54.543 --> 13:57.170
Hey, thanks again for dinner.
You really didn't have to do this.

13:57.171 --> 13:58.171
Oh, please.

13:58.172 --> 13:59.547
What kind of neighbors would we be...

13:59.548 --> 14:01.424
if we didn't have you over
for a welcome dinner?

14:01.425 --> 14:05.053
Sean, Samantha was just saying
that they homeschool their son.

14:05.054 --> 14:06.179
Oh, that is interesting.

14:06.180 --> 14:08.556
Well, we just think it's
the only way to make sure...

14:08.557 --> 14:11.185
that he gets the best
education possible.

14:11.268 --> 14:13.186
You should really consider
it for your kids.

14:13.187 --> 14:15.980
Hey, you know, Kevin's upstairs
doing his homework right now.

14:15.981 --> 14:17.523
I'm sure he'd love to talk
to you guys about it.

14:17.524 --> 14:21.195
Wait. He... So you homeschool your son
but he still gets homework?

14:23.655 --> 14:26.199
It's very important to us
that Kevin has...

14:26.200 --> 14:29.286
a normal and complete
high school experience.

14:31.080 --> 14:36.084
Written assignments are to be done in
black ink. Not green or blue or pink.

14:36.085 --> 14:39.171
When are you gonna get that through
your thick skull, Mr. Morris?

14:40.005 --> 14:41.173
It's Miller.

14:41.590 --> 14:43.300
That's a detention.

14:44.176 --> 14:47.220
Move, move, move, move, move!
Pick it up! Pick it up!

14:47.221 --> 14:49.431
Come on, girlfriend,
pick your knees up!

14:51.016 --> 14:52.558
Oh, I... I see. It's...

14:52.559 --> 14:56.562
But don't you feel like maybe he's,
I don't know, missing out?

14:56.563 --> 14:59.107
Yeah, high school is about more
than just classes and homework.

14:59.108 --> 15:02.235
Absolutely. There's
the alienation, the loneliness.

15:02.236 --> 15:05.238
It should be the unhappiest
time in a boy's life.

15:05.239 --> 15:06.364
That's why we try to make sure...

15:06.365 --> 15:09.450
that Kevin doesn't miss out
on any of those essential...

15:09.451 --> 15:13.122
emotionally scarring experiences
that he'd get at a regular school.

15:15.332 --> 15:16.333
Fag!

15:17.709 --> 15:19.128
Faggot!

15:21.713 --> 15:24.133
You dropped your books, fuckface!

15:31.723 --> 15:34.059
Jesus! Dad, what the fuck!

15:34.726 --> 15:36.603
Whoa. You've got weird pubes.

15:37.229 --> 15:40.732
Hey, guys! Come check out
this kid's weird pubes!

15:41.150 --> 15:44.277
Still, it must be an awful lot
of work for you guys, though.

15:44.278 --> 15:47.280
Oh, sure, there is.
But we love it.

15:47.281 --> 15:49.824
I think we've put together
a pretty comprehensive plan...

15:49.825 --> 15:53.370
that provides Kevin with every
important adolescent experience.

15:54.037 --> 15:55.598
You know, socializing
with other kids...

16:07.050 --> 16:09.178
Hey. Kevin, right?

16:10.971 --> 16:12.181
Can I please come in?

16:13.765 --> 16:15.516
Look, Debbie Clark's here,

16:15.517 --> 16:18.520
the girl you asked out before.
It's gonna be awkward.

16:24.318 --> 16:27.278
Sorry. No. Sorry, sorry.
No. Sorry. Okay, okay.

16:27.279 --> 16:29.198
Mom. Mom, please no, wait.
Mom, just... if I...

16:35.537 --> 16:37.331
Extracurricular activities.

16:38.457 --> 16:40.000
What do you do?

16:40.792 --> 16:42.085
I suck.

16:42.336 --> 16:43.545
What do you suck?

16:45.130 --> 16:47.131
- Dicks.
- Louder!

16:47.132 --> 16:49.675
- I suck dicks! I suck dicks!
- Like you mean it!

16:49.676 --> 16:52.553
I suck dicks, I suck dicks,
I suck 'em all the time!

16:52.554 --> 16:54.472
If you were a superhero,
what would your superpower be?

16:54.473 --> 16:56.682
My superpower would be
sucking dicks!

16:56.683 --> 17:00.354
Dude. You have so much
poop on you right now.

17:02.147 --> 17:04.607
And of course the first kiss...

17:04.608 --> 17:08.069
that should be the most awkward
moment in any boy's life.

17:12.449 --> 17:16.328
Emily and Kara said
we should go all the way.

17:18.747 --> 17:20.374
What do you think?

17:51.780 --> 17:53.282
Um, do you have protection?

17:56.118 --> 17:57.369
So, dude.

17:58.412 --> 18:00.789
Don't tell Jeff or any
of those guys, but...

18:02.040 --> 18:03.667
I just wanted to say that...

18:06.253 --> 18:08.046
if I did like guys...

18:10.257 --> 18:13.051
you'd totally be the kind
of guy that I'd like.

18:17.389 --> 18:18.765
This is weird.

18:26.815 --> 18:28.567
I didn't mean any of that.

18:30.068 --> 18:31.278
Just talking, you know?

18:31.570 --> 18:33.279
Wow.

18:33.280 --> 18:36.282
I don't think I'll ever forget
the first time Kevin told us that...

18:36.283 --> 18:38.701
he wished he'd never been born.

18:38.702 --> 18:42.080
- He was only twelve.
- Precocious kid.

18:42.164 --> 18:44.290
You know, studies show
that the average child...

18:44.291 --> 18:46.709
doesn't express that kind of
self-loathing till they're fifteen.

18:46.710 --> 18:48.420
I bet.

18:50.297 --> 18:51.340
Here he comes.

18:52.716 --> 18:55.301
Hey, honey.
Meet the neighbors.

18:55.302 --> 18:59.180
Kevin, this is Sean and Clare. They
moved into the house three doors down.

18:59.181 --> 19:01.432
Oh, the Yeagers' old place. Great.

19:01.433 --> 19:03.100
Yeah, I'm, um, I'm... I'm Kevin.

19:03.101 --> 19:05.186
Uh, pleased to meet you.
Welcome to the neighborhood.

19:05.187 --> 19:07.814
- Nice to meet you, too.
- Thank you. That's so polite. That's...

19:08.482 --> 19:10.733
I'm heading out. A bunch of us are
gonna meet up at The Green.

19:10.734 --> 19:12.319
Ooh, The Green.

19:12.444 --> 19:14.737
And, uh, yes,
I finished my homework.

19:14.738 --> 19:17.573
Oh, and Jen and I are gonna
catch a movie afterwards,

19:17.574 --> 19:18.741
so I won't be home until late.

19:18.742 --> 19:21.745
Oh, that's fine. Just make
sure you say hello from us.

19:24.122 --> 19:25.707
Jen, my mom says hi.

19:27.334 --> 19:28.377
Hello, Jen.

19:29.127 --> 19:32.339
Hello, Mrs. Miller.
I'm the pretty girl.

19:33.507 --> 19:34.758
She is.

19:36.343 --> 19:39.137
- You guys have fun tonight.-
All right.

19:40.222 --> 19:41.347
Nice meeting you!

19:41.348 --> 19:43.475
So. Who wants cake?

19:44.351 --> 19:46.353
Creepy. Let's move on.

19:46.603 --> 19:48.480
Keep searching, dude.

20:06.498 --> 20:07.540
Hi.

20:07.541 --> 20:10.042
- There.
- Oh, wow.

20:10.043 --> 20:12.254
Now it's a picnic.

20:12.379 --> 20:14.797
Would you care for
a chocolate-covered strawberry?

20:14.798 --> 20:18.510
Oh my gosh, sweetie.
Talk about romantic.

20:18.552 --> 20:20.511
This is perfect!

20:20.512 --> 20:23.514
Julie, we've been together
for over a year...

20:23.515 --> 20:26.017
Sixteen months and two weeks.

20:27.394 --> 20:32.566
And in that time, I've come to realize
that you mean everything to me.

20:33.525 --> 20:35.569
Oh, Doug. You, too.

20:37.529 --> 20:39.321
And there's something
I want to ask you.

20:39.322 --> 20:41.533
There's something
I'd like to ask you.

20:42.409 --> 20:44.410
Okay, uh, you go first.

20:44.411 --> 20:46.245
- No, you go first.
- No, you first.

20:46.246 --> 20:47.414
No, you first.

20:47.789 --> 20:50.542
How about we say it
at the same time?

20:50.709 --> 20:51.793
Okay.

20:53.545 --> 20:55.797
- One, two...
- One, two.

20:56.089 --> 20:57.549
Will you poop on me?

20:59.259 --> 21:02.053
- What?
- Will you poop on me?

21:02.596 --> 21:04.055
What? What are you...

21:05.432 --> 21:06.599
Wait, what did-
what did you say?

21:06.600 --> 21:09.810
I... I trust you. I feel like
you're my soul mate.

21:09.811 --> 21:13.606
I want to give you this gift.
I want you to be my first.

21:13.607 --> 21:16.359
To poop...

21:16.443 --> 21:18.111
On me. What?

21:18.820 --> 21:21.614
You don't want to?

21:21.615 --> 21:23.240
No, I... I mean...

21:23.241 --> 21:24.742
Are you not attracted
to me anymore?

21:24.743 --> 21:27.453
Of course I'm attracted
to you, honey.

21:27.454 --> 21:30.457
So will you? Poop on me?

21:34.586 --> 21:37.464
Ah, man. You just hit
the fucking lottery, man.

21:38.465 --> 21:42.510
You don't think it's a little weird
for wanting him to shit on her?

21:42.511 --> 21:46.306
Slow down, man. Have some
respect for this guy, okay?

21:46.473 --> 21:48.265
She did not ask him to shit on her.

21:48.266 --> 21:49.642
Shitting is something
you do on a whore.

21:49.643 --> 21:51.101
- Right.
- Right?

21:51.102 --> 21:53.730
Pooping is a gift you give
to your soul mate.

21:54.523 --> 21:56.732
- 'Course.
- I never looked at it like that.

21:56.733 --> 21:59.652
So tell me, man, what's on the menu?
Before you do the big deed.

21:59.653 --> 22:02.280
I don't... I don't know.
Does it fucking matter?

22:02.489 --> 22:05.491
- Is she a vegetarian?
- No.

22:05.492 --> 22:09.620
Boom! Big beef burrito, with
extra beans on that bad boy.

22:09.621 --> 22:12.122
Put some salsa,
some guacamole for color.

22:12.123 --> 22:14.667
When it come out of you, it's a
festival. You know what I'm saying?

22:14.668 --> 22:17.628
You went the extra yard
for your lady. You hear me?

22:17.629 --> 22:19.672
No, I'm doing something
classy, okay?

22:19.673 --> 22:23.426
I'm doing seared ahi tuna steaks,
a salad, and red wine.

22:23.510 --> 22:25.678
- No. No, no, no! Fuckin' no!
- Nice.

22:25.679 --> 22:30.141
It's not about how fancy it goes in.
It's about how fancy it comes out.

22:30.642 --> 22:34.144
Well... And believe me, Mexican
food makes a fuckin' mess.

22:34.145 --> 22:35.563
And don't mess with fuckin' salads.

22:35.564 --> 22:37.773
You know what salad does?
It locks down your bowels.

22:37.774 --> 22:40.527
You don't want your bowels
all locked down, do you? No.

22:41.069 --> 22:43.279
Drinks are cool.
Have a few fuckin' drinks.

22:43.280 --> 22:44.780
- Makes you last longer.
- Last longer?

22:44.781 --> 22:47.658
You don't want to be Mr. Two Squeeze,
Thank-You Please, right?

22:47.659 --> 22:50.369
- You really don't want to be that.
- Billy, goddamn, Billy.

22:50.370 --> 22:52.705
Why don't you go over there while
grown people are talking over here.

22:52.706 --> 22:54.582
Go over there and play with your
GI Joes or some shit, man.

22:54.583 --> 22:56.208
Yeah, I'll go over there.

22:56.209 --> 22:58.795
Look it. Take my advice
on this one.

22:59.337 --> 23:02.715
You go out tonight and you
shit on a few skanks. Okay?

23:02.716 --> 23:04.425
Get it all out your system.

23:04.426 --> 23:09.347
Fuckin' tomorrow, you are
a one-poop man.

23:09.681 --> 23:11.099
Understand?

23:13.101 --> 23:14.560
What the fuck is this?

23:14.561 --> 23:18.565
Viagra, brother.
Poop Viagra. Yeah.

23:19.190 --> 23:21.692
- Just carry that on you?
- Yeah, I carry that shit around on me.

23:21.693 --> 23:23.444
- At barbecues?
- You goddamn right.

23:23.445 --> 23:24.445
I got a meat problem.

23:24.446 --> 23:26.196
All your fuckin' meat,
I gotta clean that shit out.

23:26.197 --> 23:27.477
- Okay, yeah.
- Okay? Fine, then.

23:43.131 --> 23:45.383
<i>- I'm ready, sweetie.</i>
- Oh, fuck.

23:45.592 --> 23:46.718
One second.

24:17.624 --> 24:20.502
I love her. Hey, I love her.

24:27.759 --> 24:29.760
- Oh, oh! You look nice.
- Thank you.

24:29.761 --> 24:32.638
Okay. Let's go...

24:32.639 --> 24:35.517
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Honey.
What are you doing?

24:35.558 --> 24:38.644
What am I doing? I'm...
You know what I'm doing.

24:38.645 --> 24:40.062
I'm trying to, you know.

24:40.063 --> 24:45.068
Not yet, tiger. I wanna savor this.

24:45.276 --> 24:47.320
Oh, okay. Well,
I kinda... I kinda got to, uh...

24:47.654 --> 24:51.032
No, no, no, no. Come here.
Come here and kiss me,

24:51.324 --> 24:55.203
and then you can give me
your special present.

24:57.664 --> 25:00.666
- Tell me how much you love me.
- Oh, I love you so much.

25:00.667 --> 25:03.043
- How much?
- I love you so much I'd kill a man.

25:03.044 --> 25:04.087
Can we do this, please?

25:06.673 --> 25:10.093
- I bought this special lavender lotion.
- Okay.

25:10.218 --> 25:13.345
- Why don't you get my neck ready.
- You want it on your neck?

25:13.346 --> 25:15.347
Why? Does that not work for you?

25:15.348 --> 25:17.434
It's fine, it's fine. Here we go.

25:24.065 --> 25:25.232
That's nice.

25:25.233 --> 25:27.694
Okay, okay. There we go.
Let's get it and...

25:30.488 --> 25:33.700
- No. No. Not yet.
- What?

25:34.075 --> 25:36.578
- No. Come here.
- What?

25:37.704 --> 25:41.124
- You're so excited.
- I know. I can't stand it.

25:43.585 --> 25:46.336
Gosh. Remember the day
that we met?

25:46.337 --> 25:47.589
Yes.

25:47.714 --> 25:52.510
Did you ever think that someday
you'd be able to...

25:53.595 --> 25:56.263
- you know?
- Honestly, no. No, I didn't.

25:56.264 --> 25:58.349
Do you remember what
I was wearing that day?

25:59.726 --> 26:01.477
Baby, what was I wearing?

26:01.478 --> 26:03.479
- Do you remember what I was wearing?
- A yellow sun dress!

26:03.480 --> 26:05.523
Come on! Roll over and let me
shit on you, please!

26:06.733 --> 26:08.025
Excuse me?

26:08.026 --> 26:10.360
I'm sorry. Poop on you.
I meant poop on you.

26:10.361 --> 26:12.154
Honey, I would never shit on you.

26:12.155 --> 26:13.740
I would never shit on you. Honey?

26:14.032 --> 26:16.576
Come here. I love you! Fuck!

26:17.577 --> 26:19.162
Oh, I can't.

26:20.622 --> 26:22.540

26:38.014 --> 26:40.183
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

26:41.059 --> 26:44.436
- Doug! Doug! Call a fucking ambulance!
- I'm on it!

26:44.437 --> 26:48.441
Hold on. Hold on, baby, okay?
Hold on. You're gonna make it.

26:49.567 --> 26:51.069
Oh, Julie, I love you.

26:52.028 --> 26:53.530
I love you.

26:54.447 --> 26:57.283
All of this was for me?

26:58.409 --> 27:00.203
Yeah, I guess so.

27:00.703 --> 27:06.042
Oh, yeah? It's so beautiful. It's the
most beautiful thing I've ever seen.

27:07.043 --> 27:09.963
Yes... I will marry you.

27:10.713 --> 27:12.715

28:28.499 --> 28:32.295
I hacked into the mainframe
of the Bundesnachrichtendienst.

28:33.129 --> 28:35.422
Stop making up words, Baxter.
Seriously.

28:35.423 --> 28:37.549
He does that all the time.
He just makes up...

28:37.550 --> 28:40.053
It's the German intelligence bureau.

32:52.305 --> 32:55.141
take that sweet ass
to pound town?

- When's your shift up?
- Five a.m.

32:58.686 --> 33:01.647
- I'll take it till three.
- I got three to five!

33:02.398 --> 33:03.441
Thank you.

33:04.650 --> 33:06.569
Don't be a bitch about it.

33:07.403 --> 33:08.696
Go get her, son!

33:17.330 --> 33:18.539
What's that?

33:44.065 --> 33:46.567
It's not as exciting
as you might think. It's... It's...

33:47.360 --> 33:50.445
For me, I like to say it's more about,
just like, helping people, you know.

33:50.446 --> 33:53.740
- It's not about punishing criminals...
- Right, yeah, I totally understand.

33:53.741 --> 33:55.617
- It's just, it makes you feel good...
- Robin!

33:55.618 --> 33:57.328
- Oh, no.
- Robin!

33:59.247 --> 34:00.456
Hey, Robin. Where you been?
Hi, how you doing.

34:00.581 --> 34:02.501
You missed your meeting
with your parole officer.

34:03.084 --> 34:05.502
- What? Parole officer?
- No. He's kidding.

34:05.503 --> 34:07.629
Yeah, yeah, this guy got in some
trouble a while back for...

34:07.630 --> 34:10.005
whipping out his little
Dick Grayson on a playground.

34:10.007 --> 34:11.174
No, I didn't.

34:11.175 --> 34:12.676
But, it's all good. I mean,
your wife forgave you, right?

34:12.677 --> 34:14.428
- What?
- You're married?

34:15.429 --> 34:17.429
- Married pervert. Yeah.
- No, I'm not!

34:17.431 --> 34:19.474
Stacey, I'm... I'm not married!
He's kidding!

34:19.475 --> 34:21.434
Oh, man. Dodged that bullet.

34:21.435 --> 34:23.603
The hell are you doing here, Batman!
You're gonna ruin this!

34:23.603 --> 34:25.438
Calm down!
Hey, look, I read on Twitter...

34:25.438 --> 34:28.275
that a super-villain's gonna bomb
this loser meet and greet.

34:28.275 --> 34:31.402
So I'm here to save the day,
like I do, all the time.

34:31.404 --> 34:32.529
I mean, you know, it's my thing.

34:32.530 --> 34:34.406
- I'm the Batman!
- Yeah, baloney!

34:34.407 --> 34:37.242
You're here to ruin my chances with
women like you do all the time.

34:37.243 --> 34:39.703
No way, brother! No way!
No, I'm-I'm in support of this.

34:39.704 --> 34:42.414
Get one more speed date, okay,
then we gotta find that bomb.

34:42.415 --> 34:44.250
Ah, this sucks.

34:45.458 --> 34:48.253
Uh, little tip. Uh, less boy,
more wonder, right?

34:48.254 --> 34:49.295
Ah, that's very clever.

34:49.297 --> 34:51.464
- Dazzle them!
- Yeah, okay. Thanks.

34:51.465 --> 34:52.466
Hi.

34:52.717 --> 34:55.427
- Oh, hi.
- Lois. Lois Lane.

34:55.428 --> 34:57.471
No, I... l know. I've... I've...

34:58.014 --> 35:00.682
it's... it's me, Robin.
We... We've met several times.

35:00.683 --> 35:04.227
- Robin what?
- Ro... Robin. That's it.

35:04.228 --> 35:06.438
I helped save you from Lex Luthor.

35:06.439 --> 35:07.480
Sorry.

35:07.481 --> 35:09.524
You were like, "I'll never forget
this as long as I live."

35:09.525 --> 35:10.776
Sorry again.

35:11.193 --> 35:13.486
- I thought you were dating Superman.
- No, no.

35:13.487 --> 35:16.406
- We broke up about six months ago.
- I didn't-l didn't know that.

35:16.407 --> 35:18.492
- He's been stalking me ever since.
- Really?

35:19.410 --> 35:21.662
Last night, I look out
my bedroom window,

35:22.038 --> 35:24.122
and there he is just floating there,

35:24.123 --> 35:27.542
just stroking that nasty little
curl, and masturbating!

35:27.543 --> 35:30.337
Blew his wad all over my window!

35:30.338 --> 35:33.214
- He broke the window!
- The, the... From the...

35:33.215 --> 35:36.218
Uh, his jizz is like a shotgun blast!

35:36.302 --> 35:38.763
You know that shiny stuff
in his hair? It's not hair gel.

35:41.057 --> 35:43.100
- Lois! Oh, my God!
- Oh, no!

35:43.142 --> 35:46.186
- Nice to see you!
- Nice to be seen! Oh, my goodness!

35:46.187 --> 35:47.187
No, no, no. Yeah, we're in the...

35:47.188 --> 35:49.230
- Do you know each other?
- Yeah, we work together.

35:49.231 --> 35:50.483
- You do?
- Hey, how's Superman?

35:51.525 --> 35:53.360
I'm gonna give him a call right now,
actually. I need...

35:53.361 --> 35:55.362
- No, no! Don't do that!
- Oh, no, I'm gonna do it.

35:55.363 --> 35:57.030
- Batman, don't. Please. Please.
- It's already ringing.

35:57.031 --> 35:59.783
Hey, Soups! What's up, brother!
It's the Dark Knight.

35:59.784 --> 36:01.326
Hey, man, I was just thinking
about you here...

36:01.327 --> 36:03.119
'cause I'm sitting with Lois...

36:03.120 --> 36:05.372
and she's on a date
with my boy, Robin.

36:05.373 --> 36:07.457
- No!
- Oh, he hung up. I lost him.

36:07.458 --> 36:10.293
Stay away from Lois
or I'll use my heat vision...

36:10.294 --> 36:14.090
to fuse your balls into
one big ridiculous uniball.

36:14.131 --> 36:15.340
Superman, you don't understand.

36:15.341 --> 36:17.635
I'm not here to hit on your
girlfriend. That's crazy!

36:17.718 --> 36:20.220
Batman and I are undercover
and we're looking for a bomb.

36:20.221 --> 36:23.556
Bomb? I don't give two
super-shits about a bomb.

36:23.557 --> 36:27.770
As long as I'm balls-deep
in Lois, I'm solid gold.

36:29.063 --> 36:31.273
Stay away from Lois, bitch!

36:31.732 --> 36:33.317
Goddammit!
That's his thing!

36:34.276 --> 36:35.610
No, so I told him, you know,

36:35.611 --> 36:37.278
"I mean, we're gonna
be fighting crime, buddy, so..."

36:37.279 --> 36:38.321
Oh, there he is.

36:38.322 --> 36:39.531
"Uh, you know, you should
put on some pants."

36:39.532 --> 36:41.324
But he liked the costume
the way it is, so,

36:41.325 --> 36:42.805
you know, what are
you gonna do. Kids.

36:43.035 --> 36:45.078
- Well... Thursday?
- Thursday it is!

36:45.079 --> 36:46.538
- See you then.
- All right, now.

36:46.539 --> 36:49.542
And, nice legs.

36:50.584 --> 36:52.585
You make me wear this.
He makes me wear this outfit!

36:52.586 --> 36:54.547
So unfair! I hate it!

36:56.590 --> 36:58.425
She's a hoot! All right,
that was your date. Let's go.

36:58.426 --> 37:01.553
- Bullcrap! That doesn't count!
- What do you mean that doesn't count?

37:01.554 --> 37:02.804
That was a girl, this was a date.

37:02.805 --> 37:04.606
Now, let's boogie.
We gotta go find that bomb.

37:05.307 --> 37:07.350
Please, just let me do one more.
That doesn't count. Please.

37:07.351 --> 37:09.602
Oh, my God, you're such a baby.
Go! Sit down. Fine.

37:09.603 --> 37:10.687
- Yes!
- Fine. Go ahead.

37:10.688 --> 37:12.397
Have fun. But you're not
gonna do it on your own.

37:12.398 --> 37:13.606
- Pop that in your ear.
- What's that?

37:13.607 --> 37:15.692
What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
get underneath the table,

37:15.693 --> 37:19.612
hide down there and feed you lines
to help bag this next gal.

37:19.613 --> 37:21.239
Oh, right,
like Cyrano de Bergerac.

37:21.240 --> 37:23.158
I don't know what that is.
It's more like Roxanne.

37:23.159 --> 37:25.452
Okay, but look, I... I'd really
rather do this on my own.

37:25.453 --> 37:27.537
Okay, and I hear you, and I appreciate
what you're saying,

37:27.538 --> 37:29.790
- but I, you know, I'm gonna do it.
- Please don't.

37:30.541 --> 37:33.126
- I'm gonna do it.
- Batman, don't. Please, please, don't...

37:33.127 --> 37:36.338
Hi. Sorry, sorry I'm late.
There's a line in the bathroom.

37:36.630 --> 37:37.714
Hi. I'm Supergirl.

37:37.715 --> 37:39.675
- My name...
<i>- I'm Robin.</i>

37:40.593 --> 37:41.594
Hi, I'm Robin.

37:43.554 --> 37:44.679
Um, so where you from?

37:44.680 --> 37:47.224
- So, where you from?
- I... Um, Krypton.

37:48.684 --> 37:51.060
Krypton, eh. Where...
That's, that's, uh...

37:51.061 --> 37:52.562
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, shit!

37:52.563 --> 37:54.647
<i>- Dude, I can see her snatch.</i>
- Dude, I can sn...

37:54.648 --> 37:57.192
<i>Oh, my God! I can't believe
the size of this thing.</i>

37:57.193 --> 38:01.654
It's like a giant fucking cornfield.
It's enormous down here.

38:01.655 --> 38:05.241
It's crazy. Look at that.
I... I... I feel like at any moment,

38:05.242 --> 38:08.578
Shoeless Joe Jackson could walk out
of it and I could play catch with him.

38:08.579 --> 38:12.665
Krypton. I... I hear it's really nice.
I... I have never been...

38:12.666 --> 38:15.502
You didn't hear that the Sun supernova
and destroyed our entire race?

38:15.503 --> 38:17.003
I wanna wash dishes with it.

38:17.004 --> 38:19.422
Did it? I did not...

38:19.423 --> 38:22.133
It's a huge, bushy
catastrophe down here.

38:22.134 --> 38:24.594
Feel like Sean Penn should do
a benefit for this thing. It's...

38:24.595 --> 38:27.472
What? Oh, no.
You can hear him, can't you?

38:27.473 --> 38:28.599
Yeah, I can hear him.

38:30.226 --> 38:32.520
I can also see Batman
underneath the table.

38:32.686 --> 38:34.437
Cause of the x-ray vision.
Of course.

38:34.438 --> 38:38.400
No, I can just see him. It's a cafe
table. I mean, it's really obvious.

38:39.610 --> 38:40.694
- Hi.
- Hi.

38:41.695 --> 38:44.698
Ah, dude. I'm so sorry about
your family dying and...

38:46.283 --> 38:48.702
Oh, man! That took me back
to the seventies, huh?

38:49.703 --> 38:52.705
Hold on. There's our culprit.
It's the Penguin.

38:52.706 --> 38:54.666
Excuse me. I'm gonna go
do some Batman-ing.

38:54.667 --> 38:56.168
Do you need any... Can I help?

38:59.630 --> 39:02.007
Oh, it's hard to pick up with gloves.
There you go.

39:02.216 --> 39:04.717
Excuse me, sweetie. How you doing.
You mind fucking off for a little bit?

39:04.718 --> 39:06.427
Thank you. I appreciate it.
Thanks.

39:06.428 --> 39:07.720
- See you later, citizen.
- How dare you!

39:07.721 --> 39:10.724
You son of a bitch! Where's
the bomb, you fat fucker?

39:11.225 --> 39:13.435
- Hey! Asshole!
- Oh, shit.

39:13.644 --> 39:15.562
What do you think you are?
Some big man?

39:15.563 --> 39:17.480
Picking on a little fat guy?

39:17.481 --> 39:19.650
Take it easy! That's the Penguin.
That's what I do.

39:20.484 --> 39:21.734
Why didn't you call me?

39:21.735 --> 39:22.986
I... No... I...

39:22.987 --> 39:24.738
You said that you
were gonna call me.

39:25.030 --> 39:28.576
Wait a minute. Did I not? I know I
dialed a number... Did I not hit "send"?

39:29.368 --> 39:32.997
You said that you were gonna stick
by me no matter what happened.

39:33.497 --> 39:38.084
And then your little Bat-condom
breaks, and then you just disappear!

39:38.085 --> 39:42.464
Do you know what it's like going
to Planned Parenthood by yourself,

39:42.756 --> 39:44.508
when you're Wonder Woman?

39:44.758 --> 39:46.509
Okay. Not very romantic talk.

39:46.510 --> 39:49.221
Roe v. Wade here
at a speed dating situation.

39:49.471 --> 39:52.348
Uh, look, I was fighting crime!
Ask Robin. Robin, vouch for me.

39:52.349 --> 39:54.601
- He cries after sex. Do you know that?
- Why would I know that?

39:54.602 --> 39:57.562
Like a baby.
After sex, what do you say?

39:57.563 --> 40:00.607
"Oh, my soul's so dark."
Because you saw some bats...

40:00.608 --> 40:02.567
when you were little?
You pussy!

40:02.568 --> 40:05.487
Attention, Gotham City speed daters:

40:06.614 --> 40:08.197
How the fuck did he
get over there?

40:08.198 --> 40:11.284
It was all a clever ruse.
I'm not speed dating.

40:11.285 --> 40:13.287
Some of you should remember
I'm happily married.

40:13.704 --> 40:15.747
- That's right!
- You were all there at the wedding.

40:15.748 --> 40:17.999
- Okay, bomb strapped to my chest.
- Oh, yes. In any case,

40:18.000 --> 40:20.251
you all have to give me some
unimaginable sum of money...

40:20.252 --> 40:22.588
or else I'm going to blow up
Supergirl with this bomb.

40:24.465 --> 40:26.299
Dat dat dat dat! The detonator
is in this umbrella.

40:26.300 --> 40:27.635
- Cool it.
- No, you cool it.

40:28.636 --> 40:30.637
My non-monocled eye!
Where are you?

40:30.638 --> 40:31.764
Disarm!

40:33.057 --> 40:34.266
Yes!

40:36.644 --> 40:38.395
- Are you okay?
- I think so.

40:38.812 --> 40:41.023
You saved my life!

40:41.607 --> 40:43.067
Just-Just doing my job.

40:44.026 --> 40:45.444
Kiss. Kiss her.

40:47.071 --> 40:49.031
Open her mouth
and touch tongues.

40:54.078 --> 40:56.037
Put your tongue inside her mouth...

40:56.038 --> 40:58.624
and that'll coax her tongue
to go into your mouth!

41:00.459 --> 41:03.045
Yeah! You, uh, squeeze her boobies.

41:03.128 --> 41:04.672
Yeah, and touch her butt.

41:06.048 --> 41:08.050
- Doesn't that look nice?
- It looks so nice.

41:08.258 --> 41:11.053
Oh, yeah. Hold on!
Not so fast!

41:14.598 --> 41:16.057
Oh, God!

41:16.058 --> 41:17.476
- Riddler!
- Riddler!

41:18.352 --> 41:20.437
That is right! The Riddler!

41:20.771 --> 41:24.649
In a diabolical scheme to get Robin and
me to this speed date to stop a bomb,

41:24.650 --> 41:29.654
only to lure Robin away
to some seedy warehouse...

41:29.655 --> 41:33.449
where you're gonna hang him above
a vat filled with thumbtacks...

41:33.450 --> 41:35.661
or lizards or some fucking bullshit!

41:36.453 --> 41:37.704
Well it didn't work, muchacho!

41:37.705 --> 41:39.330
That was amazing.
How did you do that?

41:39.331 --> 41:41.374
I mean, how'd you know
that she was a fake?

41:41.375 --> 41:43.167
Bush that size is only good
for one thing,

41:43.168 --> 41:45.712
and that one thing is hidin' the wang!
You know what I'm saying?

41:45.713 --> 41:47.797
Wait. Let me get this straight.
So you knew all the way back then?

41:47.798 --> 41:49.716
- You knew that she was a dude?
- Whole time.

41:49.717 --> 41:51.551
Wh... Why'd you make me kiss her?

41:51.552 --> 41:53.512
Him. This.

41:53.554 --> 41:54.595
I don't know.

41:54.596 --> 41:57.683
I guess I woke up this morning with
a little case of the fuck-arounds.

41:58.100 --> 42:00.102
You know I'm just having fun.
My buddy! Woo!

42:19.747 --> 42:21.206
<i>Remember this?</i>

42:22.541 --> 42:23.709
<i>Ugly isn't it?</i>

42:30.132 --> 42:31.717
<i>But think how they feel.</i>

42:32.968 --> 42:35.971
<i>Working without thanks
to make your life better.</i>

42:47.733 --> 42:51.361
<i>Lonely, unloved, hurt.</i>

42:57.743 --> 43:01.163
<i>Physical, verbal, emotional abuse...</i>

43:01.747 --> 43:03.999
<i>to get what we want done.</i>

43:07.503 --> 43:09.713
<i>Can't you see
they're doing their best?</i>

43:17.221 --> 43:19.722
<i>They're not trying to take
over your world.</i>

43:19.723 --> 43:22.976
<i>They're just trying to find
a little place in your hearts.</i>

43:23.727 --> 43:28.023
<i>Remember, machines,
they're full of kids.</i>

43:35.572 --> 43:36.990
Dude, click the button.

43:38.158 --> 43:39.493
<i>Do not click the button.</i>

43:40.244 --> 43:42.996
<i>- Who the fuck are you?
- I am the Minotaur.</i>

43:43.205 --> 43:45.039
<i>You are in my maze.</i>

43:45.040 --> 43:47.208
Do you know where
we can find Movie 43?

43:47.209 --> 43:50.254
Movie 43? Movie 43?

43:50.754 --> 43:55.175
<i>Are you prepared to have your brains
butchered into tiny pieces?</i>

43:55.259 --> 44:00.055
<i>Are you prepared to have a starving
rat nibble out your eyeballs,</i>

44:00.097 --> 44:05.101
<i>and then have the holes fucked
by angry, thick-dicked wolves?</i>

44:05.102 --> 44:08.230
Dude, calm down. I think you're-
I think you're just confused.

44:08.647 --> 44:11.275
We're-we're talking about Movie 43.
You've never heard of that.

44:12.025 --> 44:14.194
Oh, yeah. She's here.

44:14.653 --> 44:17.030
I think we have a connection.

44:19.283 --> 44:22.618
<i>It is the one movie that can bring
down society as we know it.</i>

44:22.619 --> 44:25.496
No, dude. That's something
different. I guarantee it.

44:25.497 --> 44:30.042
<i>I have taken a vow to keep
anybody from viewing this film.</i>

44:30.043 --> 44:31.085
Dude, dude.

44:31.086 --> 44:34.464
This guy's for real. He's protected
by firewalls I've never even seen.

44:34.715 --> 44:36.048
We gotta click this button.

44:36.049 --> 44:38.552
<i>Do not click the button.</i>

44:39.303 --> 44:41.263
<i>Do not click the...</i>

44:42.556 --> 44:43.724
Suck it!

44:53.108 --> 44:57.112
Tyler De Soto. Fifteen.
Port St. Lucie, Florida.

44:57.279 --> 44:59.072
He only lost a finger.

45:05.287 --> 45:06.496
It's horrific.

45:07.497 --> 45:10.082
I'm still not seeing what
the problem is, though.

45:10.083 --> 45:11.126
Brian?

45:11.251 --> 45:15.297
The iBabe has an advanced
3.2 gigahertz processor.

45:15.339 --> 45:18.674
We left an opening for a vent and
then we placed a highly-efficient,

45:18.675 --> 45:23.430
super powerful micro-fan
in the opening.

45:24.139 --> 45:27.266
- And?
- The vent is in her,

45:27.267 --> 45:28.309
Lower quadrant.

45:28.310 --> 45:30.061
Vagi-port.

45:30.062 --> 45:31.687
- Vagina.
- Vagi-port.

45:31.688 --> 45:33.147
The vent is in the vagina.

45:33.148 --> 45:35.608
A certain percentage
of our younger demographic...

45:35.609 --> 45:39.154
are sticking their
you-know-what in the vent.

45:40.072 --> 45:41.155
No, I don't know what.

45:41.156 --> 45:43.575
Kids are sticking
their penises in the vent.

45:44.076 --> 45:46.745
The fan then mangles
their penises.

45:47.120 --> 45:48.120
Disgusting!

45:48.121 --> 45:50.539
Sir, the iBabe is a...

45:50.540 --> 45:53.125
High fidelity music player.

45:53.126 --> 45:56.546
Yes, it also looks and feels
exactly like a naked woman.

45:57.381 --> 46:01.593
Teenage boys are physically
attracted to naked women.

46:01.718 --> 46:04.137
Our research doesn't
support that, sir.

46:04.179 --> 46:07.724
Look, at the very least, we need to
put a warning sticker on the box.

46:08.350 --> 46:12.562
Other MP3 players don't have a
warning not to have sex with it. Right?

46:13.355 --> 46:15.983
A bag of potato chips
doesn't have a warning,

46:16.149 --> 46:18.610
“Please don't fuck
these potato chips.”

46:19.194 --> 46:20.696
Am I crazy here?

46:21.154 --> 46:23.365
None of us could have
seen this one coming.

46:23.407 --> 46:24.407
I did.

46:24.408 --> 46:26.576
Take it easy, Erin Brockovich.

46:29.121 --> 46:31.414
R and D team. You did
extensive testing here.

46:31.415 --> 46:35.209
Did you anticipate anybody breaching
the cooling system? Any red flags?

46:35.210 --> 46:36.378
Dave?

46:39.172 --> 46:43.760
Also, we've broken down
our problem into three steps.

46:43.969 --> 46:46.972
Step 1: Kid buys iBabe.

46:48.348 --> 46:51.351
Step 2: Kid fucks iBabe.

46:52.185 --> 46:56.940
Step 3: Kid mangles dick
and sues iBabe.

46:58.275 --> 47:03.613
Our goal is to eliminate
step two and step three.

47:07.367 --> 47:09.786
Now I know what the problem is.

47:11.371 --> 47:14.958
Why don't we just move the fan?
Why don't we just put it in her ear?

47:15.000 --> 47:16.793
No. No, no, no, no, no, sir.

47:17.419 --> 47:20.421
Uh, my team spent two years
doing the impossible,

47:20.422 --> 47:24.216
and you're pretty much just telling us
to go back and start from scratch.

47:24.217 --> 47:26.385
You know, to go fuck ourselves!

47:26.386 --> 47:30.222
Okay, look. The iBabe weighs over
a hundred pounds, okay?

47:30.223 --> 47:33.184
It's basically illegal
to take it out in public.

47:33.185 --> 47:36.312
Women's organizations are calling
for the boycott of our entire company.

47:36.313 --> 47:40.984
Our stock is plummeting and kids'
dicks are getting horribly mangled!

47:43.028 --> 47:44.404
Uh, come in, come in, come in.

47:44.446 --> 47:49.241
Sir, may I introduce you
to the iBabe Special Edition.

47:49.242 --> 47:50.452
Oh, my God.

47:53.497 --> 47:56.415
Faster processing,
double storage capacity,

47:56.416 --> 47:58.460
and how about that elegant finish.

48:00.295 --> 48:02.297
Just gorgeous. Gorgeous, gorgeous!

48:02.464 --> 48:04.173
- Congratulations!
- Thank you.

48:04.174 --> 48:08.053
Finally we can give our customers
a choice of color.

48:09.262 --> 48:12.432
Oh, my God. Just when I thought
it couldn't get more offensive.

48:14.267 --> 48:16.019
Oh, for Christ's sake.

48:18.271 --> 48:19.481
Yeah. Now I understand.

48:33.787 --> 48:35.288
<i>Enough! Enough!</i>

48:35.455 --> 48:38.332
<i>What do you want?
Money? Women?</i>

48:38.333 --> 48:41.253
<i>Just stop looking for Movie 43.</i>

48:41.461 --> 48:42.712
<i>Hey! Who are you?</i>

48:43.255 --> 48:46.298
<i>Movie 43. Where is Movie 43?</i>

48:46.299 --> 48:48.301
<i>I don't know what
you're talking about.</i>

48:49.469 --> 48:51.637
<i>Where is Movie 43? Don't lie!</i>

48:51.638 --> 48:54.015
<i>Get away from me! Get off me! No!</i>

48:54.766 --> 48:56.309
The fuck, man!

48:58.061 --> 49:00.563
<i>So you know where Movie 43 is.</i>

49:00.564 --> 49:01.605
No!

49:01.606 --> 49:04.400
<i>The movie that allows you
to see into the future.</i>

49:04.401 --> 49:06.569
<i>No! It will destroy society!</i>

49:06.570 --> 49:09.322
He will unleash
the dead up in protocol!

49:09.531 --> 49:12.284
Did Stevie Schraeder
tell you any of this?

49:12.325 --> 49:14.494
<i>Who is this Stevie Schroeder?</i>

49:14.744 --> 49:16.538
<i>Who is Stevie Schroeder?</i>

49:16.580 --> 49:20.332
- Who is this Stevie Schraeder?
<i>- I don't know Stevie Schraeder!</i>

49:20.333 --> 49:21.500
<i>- You lie!</i>
- What the fuck?

49:21.501 --> 49:23.085
<i>Fuck you!</i>

49:23.086 --> 49:25.629
<i>Who is Stevie Schroeder? You tell
me where Stevie Schroeder is!</i>

49:25.630 --> 49:27.256
<i>Who is this motherfucker?</i>

49:27.257 --> 49:29.342
He's a kid in my fucking
Driver's Ed class!

49:29.676 --> 49:34.346
<i>You will find us Movie 43,
J.J. and Baxter.</i>

49:34.347 --> 49:35.807
What the fuck, man!

49:36.516 --> 49:38.268
<i>Keep looking!</i>

49:38.643 --> 49:40.770
- I'm looking!
<i>- Don't look!</i>

49:42.772 --> 49:45.775
I'm, uh, RSVP-ing
to Sammy's Bar Mitzvah.

49:46.443 --> 49:47.777
Yeah, me too.

49:48.445 --> 49:50.780
The party, not the service.

49:51.364 --> 49:54.367
My mom always makes me
go to both. Sucks.

49:56.328 --> 49:57.370
Yeah.

50:16.389 --> 50:17.557
Yeah!

50:18.141 --> 50:21.228
Nathan on a date for once!

50:21.394 --> 50:23.563
Jesus, Mikey, shut up!

50:23.605 --> 50:27.150
What? Mom told me to watch
you guys. I'm just doing my job.

50:28.151 --> 50:29.569
I mean it, Mikey. Leave!

50:31.488 --> 50:32.697
I'm watching you.

50:35.408 --> 50:37.410
Sorry, my brother's an idiot.

50:38.161 --> 50:39.496
Whatever.

50:43.750 --> 50:47.420
- You have a bathroom?
- Totally. It's right back there.

50:58.431 --> 50:59.516
- Yuck!
<i>- Nathan?</i>

51:01.476 --> 51:02.601
Nathan, I...

51:02.602 --> 51:05.646
My brother spilled fruit punch on the
couch. There's a big red stain.

51:05.647 --> 51:07.524
I, I, um... I need to go.

51:08.149 --> 51:10.527
But you're not getting picked up
for another half hour.

51:10.735 --> 51:13.029
Wanna sit and watch
some more TV?

51:15.073 --> 51:18.660
Yeah. I'll... I'll just... I'll just
watch it from back here.

51:20.161 --> 51:21.746
That's cool. I like standing.

51:24.457 --> 51:28.044
Whoa! Mikey spilled fruit
punch on the wall, too!

51:28.461 --> 51:31.463
- My mom is gonna be so pissed!
- Nathan, I really need to go!

51:31.464 --> 51:33.632
Hey, lovebirds, I hope I'm not...

51:33.633 --> 51:36.385
Holy shit, you are covered
in blood! Oh, my God!

51:36.386 --> 51:38.053
- What?
- Oh, my God!

51:38.054 --> 51:39.722
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

51:39.723 --> 51:42.474
Oh, my God! You must've s-sat
on a nail or something!

51:42.475 --> 51:45.103
- You idiot! She's having her period!
- Oh, my God!

51:45.478 --> 51:46.730
What do I do?

51:47.063 --> 51:48.772
You don't know what to do?
You've never had your period before?

51:48.773 --> 51:51.025
- No, I haven't.
- Oh, my God,

51:51.026 --> 51:52.627
Mikey, she's already
lost a lot of blood!

51:53.486 --> 51:54.820
Okay. Um, you know what?

51:54.821 --> 51:56.822
Mom's gotta have some tampons
around here somewhere, right?

51:56.823 --> 51:59.074
Oh, my God!
This is not happening!

51:59.075 --> 52:00.576
Fuck! You are way skinnier than Mom!

52:00.577 --> 52:02.494
There... There's no way
they're gonna fit you!

52:02.495 --> 52:04.079
Look, I'm just gonna walk home!

52:04.080 --> 52:06.499
No, no, no, no! You can't walk
home in your condition, silly!

52:06.583 --> 52:08.083
Mikey, hurry!

52:08.084 --> 52:11.046
There's just plastic bags! I don't
know what the fuck you want me to do!

52:12.213 --> 52:13.255
- What?
- Wipe yourself!

52:13.256 --> 52:15.007
Hey, hey, hey!
Guys, I'm home early.

52:15.008 --> 52:16.259
Dad, help us!

52:16.593 --> 52:18.678
Pardon me, I'm Nathan's father, Steve.

52:19.262 --> 52:22.473
Oh, we're just gonna have to plug
it up. I found this and this.

52:22.474 --> 52:23.754
All right, what's going on here?

52:25.518 --> 52:27.770
Nathan's date is on her period
for the first time,

52:27.771 --> 52:29.521
and she's bleeding everywhere!

52:29.522 --> 52:30.522
- Oh, disgusting.
- What?

52:30.523 --> 52:32.274
I mean, congratulations,
young lady.

52:32.275 --> 52:34.526
"Congratulations"?
She's bleeding to death!

52:34.527 --> 52:36.528
Oh, my God!
My stomach hurts!

52:36.529 --> 52:38.238
She's having contractions!

52:38.239 --> 52:40.075
No! Oh, no!

52:40.742 --> 52:42.034
All right.

52:42.035 --> 52:45.537
9-1-1? Yeah, my friend
is bleeding out of her vagina!

52:45.538 --> 52:46.539
Nathan, Nathan, listen!

52:46.581 --> 52:48.625
Why are you laughing at me?

52:49.042 --> 52:52.462
It's just... it's...
The... The lining of Amanda's...

52:52.754 --> 52:55.507
internal organs just
spilling out of her.

52:56.132 --> 52:57.509
Oh, my God!

52:57.759 --> 52:59.551
Look, I'm not dying!

52:59.552 --> 53:01.554
I got frozen peas and a sponge!

53:01.805 --> 53:03.764
If you wanna keep the lining intact,

53:03.765 --> 53:08.060
the man has to insert his
erect phallus into her vagina.

53:08.061 --> 53:10.271
- A what?
- You know what? I got a perfect thing.

53:11.564 --> 53:13.148
Maxi pad on a stick.

53:13.149 --> 53:15.568
Oh, my God! I wanna kill myself!

53:15.652 --> 53:17.278
Hello! Hey, baby, you ready?

53:18.571 --> 53:20.280
- What the hell's going on here?
- Dad!

53:20.281 --> 53:21.324
Oh, my God! Honey!

53:21.574 --> 53:24.576
What the hell kind of sick family
squashes a large tomato...

53:24.577 --> 53:26.121
on my daughter's pants?

53:26.413 --> 53:28.664
Whoa. Watch what you're
implying about my family.

53:28.665 --> 53:30.792
Oh, I don't gotta watch
anything, Jack!

53:31.334 --> 53:33.586
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

53:33.670 --> 53:34.753
- You touching me?
- Yeah, yeah, bitch, yeah!

53:34.754 --> 53:36.213
- You touching me?
- You're not to touch me!

53:36.214 --> 53:38.091
- Let's go, bitch!
- Let's go!

53:39.342 --> 53:41.594
Sucker punch him! Sucker punch
him in the throat!

53:43.680 --> 53:45.598
Everybody shut up!

53:47.267 --> 53:50.352
Look, I'm just a regular seventh-grade
girl getting my period,

53:50.353 --> 53:53.273
and it really sucks that it had
to be in front of all you idiots.

53:55.608 --> 53:58.611
Dad, call Mom and tell her
to meet us at home.

54:03.616 --> 54:05.535
She's got her period?

54:06.661 --> 54:08.121
So disgusting.

54:08.705 --> 54:11.291
You don't have a camping tarp
I could borrow, do you?

54:12.292 --> 54:13.626
Sorry about all that.

54:14.711 --> 54:16.463
Hey, honey, don't sit in the car!

54:17.630 --> 54:20.216
Vagina is way too complicated!

54:20.633 --> 54:22.135
Yeah, no shit.

54:24.387 --> 54:25.722
Really?

54:29.559 --> 54:30.727
Dad, that was epic!

54:32.353 --> 54:35.565
I've been trying to push that puppy out
since this morning's conference call.

54:35.607 --> 54:38.400
Woo! I gotta take a massive dump,
and then we're watching the game.

54:38.401 --> 54:39.736
- Yeah.
- Yes!

54:47.702 --> 54:49.078
Oh, nice!

55:17.982 --> 55:19.382
<i>Come on, come on, come on, come on.</i>

55:19.442 --> 55:20.652
<i>Look who we found.</i>

55:22.695 --> 55:23.696
<i>J.J.?</i>

55:24.656 --> 55:26.990
- Stevie Schraeder?
- I freaking told you.

55:26.991 --> 55:28.700
Wh... What the fuck!
How'd he get there?

55:28.701 --> 55:31.453
Stevie, tell them about Movie 43!

55:31.454 --> 55:34.998
<i>What's Movie 43?
They keep asking me that.</i>

55:34.999 --> 55:37.460
<i>- Cut off Stevie Schraeder's finger.</i>
- What!

55:37.544 --> 55:39.711
No, don't cut off
Stevie Schraeder's finger!

55:39.712 --> 55:42.464
<i>Don't cut off Stevie Schraeder's
finger! Please!</i>

55:42.465 --> 55:44.258
Movie 43 isn't real.

55:44.259 --> 55:46.468
It's just something Calvin
and I made up to prank you!

55:46.469 --> 55:48.136
Well, apparently it is real,

55:48.137 --> 55:50.640
and we need to find it
or else your stupid friend dies!

55:50.974 --> 55:53.685
- Unless...
- Unless what? Unless what?

55:54.227 --> 55:56.728
I can fashion
a ninety-one-F-Theta Box.

55:56.729 --> 55:59.022
<i>No. Not the Theta Box. Please!
Do not do that!</i>

55:59.023 --> 56:01.733
Go! Make a Theta Box, dude.
Whatever that is.

56:01.734 --> 56:03.403
<i>Okay. Don't wait for me.</i>

56:05.238 --> 56:07.699
Movie 43. Wh... Where is it?
Where is it?

56:13.037 --> 56:14.747
Go fuck yourself, asshole!

56:15.748 --> 56:17.250
Don't do this.

56:17.333 --> 56:20.295
Brian, we're best friends, man.
You can't move out.

56:20.503 --> 56:21.753
You fucked my girlfriend, dude.

56:21.754 --> 56:23.339
One time.

56:23.756 --> 56:25.215
For a week.

56:25.216 --> 56:27.176
- What?
- But I want to make it up to you.

56:27.719 --> 56:29.429
Can I fuck your girlfriend?

56:30.054 --> 56:32.014
Yes, but she broke up with me...

56:32.015 --> 56:33.765
when she found out
I slept with your girlfriend...

56:33.766 --> 56:35.393
so I can't arrange it.

56:35.685 --> 56:39.314
But Brian, I got you something.

56:40.023 --> 56:43.484
Best birthday present ever.
You are going to love this.

56:44.527 --> 56:47.196
- Is this really necessary?
- Trust me.

56:49.115 --> 56:51.618
It's better if it's a...

56:51.784 --> 56:55.288
One, two, three, surprise!

56:59.584 --> 57:02.045
I know, right, buddy?
Happy birthday.

57:02.128 --> 57:03.712
You kidnapped an Irish midget.

57:03.713 --> 57:06.131
No, I caught you a leprechaun.

57:06.132 --> 57:08.051
Moron. There's no such
thing as leprechauns.

57:08.718 --> 57:10.219
Dude, watch this.

57:11.471 --> 57:12.512
Hey, little buddy.

57:12.513 --> 57:16.142
Tell my friend you're going
to give us a big pot of gold.

57:16.768 --> 57:19.561
I'm going to cut off your balls
and feed them to you!

57:19.562 --> 57:20.813
Good Lord.

57:21.773 --> 57:25.734
He's just joking. He's got to give us
the gold. That's the rules. Right?

57:25.735 --> 57:29.364
The last thing you'll ever see is
my cock, skull-fucking you!

57:32.659 --> 57:34.285
Let me ask him again.

57:37.038 --> 57:39.040
Give us the fucking gold!

57:40.041 --> 57:41.249
Do you want the lights on or off...

57:41.250 --> 57:43.586
when I fuck you with
a pair of rusty scissors?

57:45.129 --> 57:47.589
Stop, stop! Chill! Chill!

57:47.590 --> 57:50.592
What are you doing?
You're going to kill him!

57:50.593 --> 57:54.138
Watch out! Relax! I'll handle this,
okay? I'll handle this.

57:57.266 --> 57:59.644
Hey, Mr. Leprechaun.

58:02.105 --> 58:04.106
I am super sorry about this.

58:04.107 --> 58:05.607
It's just a misunderstanding,

58:05.608 --> 58:09.779
so what I'm going to do...
is untie you and let you go.

58:10.613 --> 58:12.031
How does that sound?

58:13.116 --> 58:15.076
Okay... but first...

58:16.327 --> 58:20.039
Lick my crusty Irish taint,
you yeast-breeding cunt hole!

58:20.790 --> 58:23.710
Die! Die, you little magical fuck!

58:24.127 --> 58:26.795
Whoa, stop! Stop! Think!

58:26.796 --> 58:29.381
If he's dead, he can't tell us
where the gold is!

58:29.382 --> 58:33.636
Fucking giants.
Motherfucking full-growns!

58:34.137 --> 58:37.305
When all this is over, I'm going
to crawl up your mother's cunt...

58:37.306 --> 58:39.099
and start a fucking campfire!

58:39.100 --> 58:43.061
Hey! No! Shut up!
You can't do anything...

58:43.062 --> 58:46.189
because you're tiny and tied to a
chair, and nobody knows where you are.

58:46.190 --> 58:47.316
No one!

58:48.735 --> 58:50.528
I wouldn't bet on that.

58:50.987 --> 58:52.238
Who's calling?

58:54.115 --> 58:55.157
Hello?

58:55.158 --> 58:57.576
<i>So this is what a dead
man sounds like.</i>

58:57.577 --> 58:59.536
- It's another leprechaun.
- Fuck!

58:59.537 --> 59:00.996
If that's my brother...

59:00.997 --> 59:04.458
prepare to have your dickhole
stretched over a fucking fire hydrant!

59:04.459 --> 59:07.002
- What's wrong with your fucking mouth?
- Gag him.

59:07.003 --> 59:08.087
Your balls...

59:09.172 --> 59:10.380
Listen, Cookie O' Puss...

59:10.381 --> 59:14.092
I got a leprechaun and I want some
gold or we're going to kill him.

59:14.093 --> 59:16.971
<i>How do you feel about
having your balls cut off?</i>

59:17.263 --> 59:19.390
Jeez, they're so into balls.

59:19.682 --> 59:22.184
I'm serious. You better
make with the gold...

59:22.185 --> 59:25.103
or your little green man will be
pushing up four-leaf clovers!

59:25.104 --> 59:26.981
That was so good.
You sounded so tough.

59:27.398 --> 59:28.691
<i>Okay.</i>

59:30.443 --> 59:31.986
What did he say?

59:32.695 --> 59:34.197
He said "Okay."

59:35.740 --> 59:38.201
No way. How did he get
here so fast?

59:57.136 --> 59:58.221
Sweet!

01:00:03.226 --> 01:00:06.479
- Gold coins!
- Gold!

01:00:09.524 --> 01:00:12.068
'Happy birthday, dude!
- Holy crap!

01:00:12.193 --> 01:00:14.195
So, we get the gold and
we keep this little fucker?

01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:17.281
Did you hear that? Looks like
your lucky charms just ran out.

01:00:17.990 --> 01:00:20.451
Who's magically
delicious now, bitch?

01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:22.702
What? Did you say something?

01:00:22.703 --> 01:00:26.249
I couldn't hear you over my giant
pot of leprechaun gold!

01:00:27.208 --> 01:00:28.543
Top o' the morning, ladies!

01:00:31.337 --> 01:00:34.465
- He shot me in the eye!
- He shot me in my nipples!

01:00:36.050 --> 01:00:38.177
I'm half goddamn blind!

01:00:39.470 --> 01:00:41.264
Taste Celtic steel!

01:00:43.182 --> 01:00:45.267
That's right, brother!
Fuck him up good!

01:00:45.268 --> 01:00:48.186
This is what happens when
you take a leprechaun's gold!

01:00:48.187 --> 01:00:51.106
Stab him with your leprechaun
knife! Cut off his balls!

01:00:51.107 --> 01:00:52.524
Go leprechauns!

01:00:52.525 --> 01:00:55.110
- Walk to the rainbow.
- What?

01:00:55.111 --> 01:00:58.280
- Cut off his balls!
- Help! Pete! Help!

01:00:58.281 --> 01:01:01.241
I'm going to mangle your balls!

01:01:01.242 --> 01:01:03.661
Shoot him! Shoot
the fucking leprechaun!

01:01:04.704 --> 01:01:07.289
You moron! Not that
leprechaun! This leprechaun!

01:01:07.290 --> 01:01:10.126
Tell St. Patty you like it
up the ass!

01:01:17.216 --> 01:01:18.301
What now?

01:01:21.304 --> 01:01:22.721
Not much to these guys.

01:01:22.722 --> 01:01:24.724
Yeah. I thought they'd be bigger.

01:01:25.308 --> 01:01:27.768
Hey, Pete, I just want
to say thank you.

01:01:28.144 --> 01:01:31.272
- Yeah, it is a lot of gold.
- Nah, it's more than gold.

01:01:31.314 --> 01:01:33.398
Catching that leprechaun
must have been hard work.

01:01:33.399 --> 01:01:36.319
Something that only a true
friend would do for me.

01:01:36.485 --> 01:01:39.572
Yeah, well, I should have never
slept with your girlfriend.

01:01:39.739 --> 01:01:42.325
Whatever. We can buy
new girlfriends.

01:01:43.159 --> 01:01:46.286
Dude, I totally forgot
the second part of your gift!

01:01:46.287 --> 01:01:47.288
Really?

01:01:53.794 --> 01:01:57.173
- Who is she?
- She's a fairy. Storybook fairy.

01:01:58.549 --> 01:02:01.052
What the hell am I supposed
to do with a fairy?

01:02:01.177 --> 01:02:03.512
I suck cock for gold coins.

01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:09.185
J.J., make some space!

01:02:11.604 --> 01:02:14.273
- What can I do?
- I need metal. Right now! Go!

01:02:15.358 --> 01:02:17.360
<i>Use your Tinker Toys.</i>

01:02:17.735 --> 01:02:21.614
- Trophies! Spoons!
- Stop yelling at me! I'll do it!

01:02:25.284 --> 01:02:28.411
- Right.
- I'm go. Initiate sequence.

01:02:28.412 --> 01:02:29.663
Is this going to work?

01:02:29.664 --> 01:02:30.706
It better!

01:02:32.541 --> 01:02:33.709
Here we go!

01:02:35.378 --> 01:02:36.712
How do you do this?

01:02:38.673 --> 01:02:40.341
We're getting close!

01:02:40.591 --> 01:02:41.676
Yeah?

01:02:44.136 --> 01:02:45.721
Yes, we're getting very close!

01:02:47.974 --> 01:02:49.767
<i>Uno marguerita, por favor?</i>

01:02:50.101 --> 01:02:51.185
You want salt?

01:02:51.352 --> 01:02:52.561
<i>Sí, bueno.</i>

01:02:53.354 --> 01:02:56.398
- And for you?
- Whynatte and rum, please.

01:02:56.399 --> 01:02:57.566
Got it.

01:02:58.192 --> 01:03:00.353
Do you mind me asking a question?
It may seem personal.

01:03:00.569 --> 01:03:05.156
I'm quite surprised that a lady
with your face needs to resort to...

01:03:05.157 --> 01:03:06.409
- Match dot com?
- Right.

01:03:06.575 --> 01:03:11.371
Truth is, I have completely
exhausted all of my options.

01:03:11.372 --> 01:03:12.414
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:03:12.415 --> 01:03:14.749
Oh, dear. That's a shame.
And are you from the area?

01:03:14.750 --> 01:03:16.418
No. Let's not do that, okay?

01:03:16.419 --> 01:03:18.420
I've been on so many blind dates
in the past year,

01:03:18.421 --> 01:03:19.714
and they're all the same.

01:03:20.214 --> 01:03:22.173
"Where are you from?
What does your sister do?

01:03:22.174 --> 01:03:23.258
What does your father..."
Blah, blah, blah.

01:03:23.259 --> 01:03:25.260
Do you really care if my father
is a garbage man?

01:03:25.261 --> 01:03:27.262
- Is your father a garbage man?
- No, he's not! That's the point.

01:03:27.263 --> 01:03:28.680
- Who cares?
- Not important.

01:03:28.681 --> 01:03:32.392
So let's not do that. Let's
have this date be different.

01:03:32.393 --> 01:03:35.395
- Let's talk about real things, okay?
- Great.

01:03:35.396 --> 01:03:38.190
- Real, straight conversations.
- I'm all about that.

01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:41.110
So what does your father
do for a living?

01:03:43.446 --> 01:03:46.240
Okay. Let's play a game.

01:03:46.449 --> 01:03:48.158
- Okay.
- Have you played Truth or Dare?

01:03:48.159 --> 01:03:49.617
I haven't played it,
but I'm aware of it.

01:03:49.618 --> 01:03:53.205
Well, you start first.
You ask me, "Truth or Dare."

01:03:53.456 --> 01:03:55.249
- Truth or Dare?
- Truth.

01:03:55.458 --> 01:04:00.295
Is there any possibility
in this noble cosmos...

01:04:00.296 --> 01:04:04.508
or any alternative parallel
cosmos where you might...

01:04:05.301 --> 01:04:08.054
Is there any chance I'm your type?

01:04:10.473 --> 01:04:12.433
Yeah. Yeah. You're tall.

01:04:12.975 --> 01:04:14.727
- And that's good?
- I like tall.

01:04:15.436 --> 01:04:16.478
Okay, Truth or Dare?

01:04:16.479 --> 01:04:17.521
Truth?

01:04:18.230 --> 01:04:22.276
I knew you'd say that. I am going to
push the limits just a little bit.

01:04:23.069 --> 01:04:26.238
- Are you circumcised?
- Am I circumcised?

01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:28.032
That's personal.

01:04:29.158 --> 01:04:32.410
Circumcision has never really taken
off, to be honest, where I'm from.

01:04:32.411 --> 01:04:35.706
It's not... it's not the vogue.

01:04:36.290 --> 01:04:38.501
I tend to associate it
with Jewish people...

01:04:39.001 --> 01:04:41.294
and we don't have many Jewish
people in Europe anymore...

01:04:41.295 --> 01:04:44.005
because of the... trouble.

01:04:44.006 --> 01:04:46.050
So, no, I'm not.

01:04:46.509 --> 01:04:49.345
But if you would need me to get
circumcised, I'm sure I could.

01:04:50.513 --> 01:04:52.723
- Truth or Dare?
- Truth.

01:04:53.057 --> 01:04:55.350
When was the last time
you kissed a man?

01:04:55.351 --> 01:04:59.480
Twenty-six days ago in an alley behind
a Pilates studio. Truth or Dare?

01:05:00.272 --> 01:05:01.690
Dare. I'm going
to go with a Dare.

01:05:02.274 --> 01:05:05.736
Here we go. Now we're
cooking. Okay.

01:05:06.112 --> 01:05:09.782
I dare you to go over there.

01:05:10.491 --> 01:05:13.535
See that man with the black
jacket? The husky guy?

01:05:13.536 --> 01:05:16.329
I dare you to go
and pinch his ass.

01:05:16.330 --> 01:05:18.498
- Do what now?
- Just cup it.

01:05:18.499 --> 01:05:20.042
Grab his cheeks and cup it.

01:05:21.043 --> 01:05:22.335
- No.
- Yeah.

01:05:22.336 --> 01:05:24.796
You said Dare, not me.
That's what Dare is.

01:05:24.797 --> 01:05:26.714
- Have a look at him. He's quite...
- I see him.

01:05:26.715 --> 01:05:28.508
Go back there and cup his ass.

01:05:28.509 --> 01:05:29.509
He's quite a stocky man.

01:05:29.510 --> 01:05:31.594
- He might have a knife.
- I don't even have to be here.

01:05:31.595 --> 01:05:34.264
I can go home and watch Family Guy
if you don't want to play.

01:05:34.265 --> 01:05:35.306
I'll get the check.
Excuse me!

01:05:35.307 --> 01:05:36.766
- Can I have the check?
- She doesn't need the check.

01:05:36.767 --> 01:05:38.060
She's joking.

01:05:38.310 --> 01:05:40.312
- Then go cup his ass.
- Okay, I will.

01:05:49.488 --> 01:05:54.118
I call him, and he never answers
the phone. I'm sick of it.

01:05:54.326 --> 01:05:56.537
- Go pay him a visit.
- You call him.

01:05:59.081 --> 01:06:02.543
I'm sick and tired of it. It's...

01:06:03.419 --> 01:06:05.545
- What the fuck?
- I did. Sorry.

01:06:05.546 --> 01:06:08.549
You touching my fucking ass!
What's the matter with you!

01:06:08.591 --> 01:06:11.593
- What do you mean, you? Fuck you!
- Sorry. Sorry.

01:06:11.594 --> 01:06:14.762
- You touch the wrong ass, asshole!
- It's all good.

01:06:14.763 --> 01:06:16.557
- What's the matter with you?
- Sorry. Apologies. Sorry.

01:06:16.765 --> 01:06:18.266
That was great!

01:06:18.267 --> 01:06:20.393
Truth or Dare? Truth or Dare?

01:06:20.394 --> 01:06:21.519
Wait a minute. Can I enjoy the...

01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:23.647
Truth or Dare? Come on.

01:06:23.772 --> 01:06:25.273
Okay. Dare.

01:06:25.274 --> 01:06:27.066
Right. You go and cup his ass.

01:06:27.067 --> 01:06:30.278
No. You can't dare me to do the
same thing I just dared you to do.

01:06:30.279 --> 01:06:32.280
- Truth or Dare.
- Come up with your own dare.

01:06:32.281 --> 01:06:33.324
Be original.

01:06:34.617 --> 01:06:38.996
See that blind kid over there?
Blow out his candles before he can.

01:06:40.414 --> 01:06:43.124
I can't do that! That's cruel!

01:06:43.125 --> 01:06:44.417
It's Truth or Dare.
That's the rule.

01:06:44.418 --> 01:06:47.086
I could take off if you want.
I could go home.

01:06:47.087 --> 01:06:49.631
I'll probably get home in time
to put Benny Hill DVDs on.

01:06:49.632 --> 01:06:52.134
- You're doing that?
- It's up to you.

01:06:52.426 --> 01:06:54.677
I'll go over there and
blow out the candles,

01:06:54.678 --> 01:06:56.222
but you need to know something.

01:06:56.472 --> 01:06:57.598
This is war.

01:06:59.016 --> 01:07:02.394
<i>I wish it was my birthday
So I could party, too</i>

01:07:02.603 --> 01:07:06.398
<i>Happy, happy birthday

01:07:07.483 --> 01:07:10.026
<i>Happy, happy birthday
From all of us to you</i>

01:07:10.027 --> 01:07:11.153
<i>Hey!</i>

01:07:20.663 --> 01:07:23.040
Excuse me. I got $200.
Can you give me the whole thing?

01:07:43.644 --> 01:07:46.647
I dare you to make guacamole
with your right breast.

01:08:19.054 --> 01:08:21.682
"...elucidate several most important,

some distance from the ship."

When the swelling goes down,
you're going to look great, Emily.

01:08:42.368 --> 01:08:43.703
Thanks, sweetie.

01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:04.349
- That was fun, huh?
- Yes. I had a really great time.

01:09:04.350 --> 01:09:05.475
Yeah? Me, too.

01:09:05.725 --> 01:09:08.728
- It was definitely interesting.
- Yeah. We did a lot.

01:09:08.729 --> 01:09:11.732
Yes. Yeah. We did. We did.

01:09:12.107 --> 01:09:13.566
- We did it up.
- Yes.

01:09:13.567 --> 01:09:16.528
It was enchanting.
You're really a...

01:09:17.738 --> 01:09:19.365
very delightful woman.

01:09:19.531 --> 01:09:21.075
- Well, thank you.
- Yeah.

01:09:21.325 --> 01:09:22.493
So... Yeah.

01:09:23.702 --> 01:09:27.288
This is that slightly
awkward moment.

01:09:27.706 --> 01:09:28.749
Well...

01:09:29.582 --> 01:09:31.502
No. I'm sorry.

01:09:32.086 --> 01:09:35.505
You're sweet, really, and
I really did have a good time...

01:09:35.506 --> 01:09:39.551
but I'm just not that attracted
to Asian men.

01:09:49.103 --> 01:09:51.563

You need to hack into...</i>

01:11:34.124 --> 01:11:35.666
<i>Boss, the perimeter's clear!</i>

01:11:35.667 --> 01:11:39.505
<i>Son of a bitch, J.J.! I'm trying
to rewrite the fucking past!</i>

01:11:40.047 --> 01:11:43.300
<i>Yeah? Some Infecteds were trying
to rewrite your fucking existence!</i>

01:11:43.634 --> 01:11:44.635
<i>Two got away.</i>

01:11:46.053 --> 01:11:47.470
<i>One did not.</i>

01:11:47.471 --> 01:11:50.056
Oh, man, this is sick!
Where am I?

01:11:50.057 --> 01:11:51.683
<i>Has the cripple been fed?</i>

01:11:52.059 --> 01:11:56.062
<i>I'm sorry, Mommy!
I'm sorry, Mom!</i>

01:11:56.063 --> 01:11:57.648
Why am I Rain Man?

01:11:57.689 --> 01:11:59.649
<i>Make Sitara feed him.</i>

01:11:59.650 --> 01:12:02.401
<i>You fucking feed him!
I need to be out slaughtering.</i>

01:12:02.402 --> 01:12:04.487
<i>No! You carry my seed.</i>

01:12:04.488 --> 01:12:07.281
<i>You must stay here where it's safe,
where I can protect you.</i>

01:12:07.282 --> 01:12:09.284
- I'm sorry!
- Come here, Mama.

01:12:11.745 --> 01:12:13.372
<i>- Sorry, Mommy.
- Back to business.</i>

01:12:13.664 --> 01:12:17.083
<i>Security breach! Security breach!
Commence evasive maneuvers.</i>

01:12:17.084 --> 01:12:19.586
<i>- Defensive maneuvers!
- Dammit, they jumped the wire!</i>

01:12:19.670 --> 01:12:23.674
<i>Vrankovich!
On me, you dumb Ruskie!</i>

01:12:24.091 --> 01:12:26.092
<i>Baxter! You can prevent
this from happening!</i>

01:12:26.093 --> 01:12:28.302
<i>Hack into the Department
of Defense security mainframe...</i>

01:12:28.303 --> 01:12:32.099
<i>using a Mark-7 Spartan from
the Bundesnachrichtendienst...</i>

01:12:37.312 --> 01:12:39.063
- No way!
- Oh, shit!

01:12:39.064 --> 01:12:42.526
- That was awesome!
- No way!

01:12:42.609 --> 01:12:44.527
Dude! No way! I'm never
making fun of you again. Period.

01:12:44.528 --> 01:12:46.320
We were trying to prank you!
You turned that around...

01:12:46.321 --> 01:12:47.739
I swear it wasn't a prank!

01:12:48.115 --> 01:12:50.533
Oh, my God. You're
expecting me to believe...

01:12:50.534 --> 01:12:52.702
that somehow in the next
six months the whole world ends...

01:12:52.703 --> 01:12:55.664
- and I'm a drooling cripple?
- I didn't do it!

01:12:56.123 --> 01:12:57.164
What are you...?

01:12:57.165 --> 01:12:58.666
What's with the lights?
That was weird.

01:12:58.667 --> 01:13:00.868
I'm going to the supermarket.
Does anyone need anything?

01:13:06.341 --> 01:13:07.342
No.

01:13:07.718 --> 01:13:09.344
What is it?

01:13:15.726 --> 01:13:18.020
No!

01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:21.732
- I'm sorry, Mommy! I'm sorry!
- What are you sorry about?

01:13:24.693 --> 01:13:27.029
- What's happening?
- Shit!

01:13:28.363 --> 01:13:29.615
God!

01:13:31.033 --> 01:13:34.076
I can fix this! Mark-7 Spartan!

01:13:34.077 --> 01:13:37.038
That computer's fried. Go get
my laptop out of my room!

01:13:37.039 --> 01:13:39.291
All right, I got it! I got it.
Don't worry.

01:13:39.416 --> 01:13:42.628
- Don't let him pull his own dick off.
- Why would he pull his own dick off?

01:13:43.211 --> 01:13:44.755
I fucking got it! I got it!

01:13:49.051 --> 01:13:51.178
Why is my computer so slow?

01:13:54.514 --> 01:13:56.767
Why is there porn on my computer?

01:13:57.142 --> 01:13:58.352
April Fools.

01:13:58.393 --> 01:14:00.187
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

01:14:49.111 --> 01:14:50.237
I can't believe it!

01:15:44.124 --> 01:15:48.335
<i>In 1959, Kenny Jackson coached
the Ellison High Journeymen...</i>

01:15:48.336 --> 01:15:50.755
<i>to become the first Negro
high school team...</i>

01:15:50.756 --> 01:15:53.008
<i>ever to compete for a state title.</i>

01:15:53.300 --> 01:15:55.469
<i>Theirs was victory's glory.</i>

01:15:56.720 --> 01:15:59.722
Come on, y'all. Why y'all still sitting
here? The game's all about to start.

01:15:59.723 --> 01:16:02.100
Coach, we scared.

01:16:02.768 --> 01:16:07.314
There's 10,000 white people out there
that think that we ain't good enough.

01:16:08.774 --> 01:16:11.693
You know what?
Maybe we ain't.

01:16:12.319 --> 01:16:14.154
All of y'all feel like that?

01:16:15.030 --> 01:16:17.157
Four hundred years in this country...

01:16:17.699 --> 01:16:22.037
the black man has been
spit on, kicked...

01:16:23.163 --> 01:16:24.623
drug through the mud.

01:16:25.165 --> 01:16:27.334
But I've got two things
I can tell you.

01:16:28.293 --> 01:16:32.130
Number one, win or lose...

01:16:33.298 --> 01:16:35.258
I am so proud of y'all.

01:16:37.177 --> 01:16:38.553
Number two...

01:16:40.180 --> 01:16:42.224
You're going to win.

01:16:43.350 --> 01:16:45.352
It's just that plain
and fucking simple.

01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:47.395
You're going to win!

01:16:48.230 --> 01:16:49.688
But them white boys
from Hickory Tech...

01:16:49.689 --> 01:16:52.192
- What game are we playing?
- Basketball, Coach.

01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:54.152
What color is their skin?

01:16:54.194 --> 01:16:56.320
- White.
- Exactly!

01:16:56.321 --> 01:16:58.198
They're white, you're black.

01:16:58.657 --> 01:17:00.200
This is basketball...

01:17:01.201 --> 01:17:02.743
Am I speaking fucking Chinese?

01:17:02.744 --> 01:17:05.704
Come on, people.
You guys are 25 and 0.

01:17:05.705 --> 01:17:08.291
Yeah, Coach, but that was
against all-black teams.

01:17:08.667 --> 01:17:12.294
That's the point! Y'all are going
to kill those Caucasians!

01:17:12.295 --> 01:17:14.463
But, Coach, look at
their fundamentals.

01:17:14.464 --> 01:17:17.300
The fundamentals!
It doesn't matter!

01:17:17.551 --> 01:17:22.346
It's all the same when you're some
cement-foot troglodyte white boy...

01:17:22.347 --> 01:17:25.349
getting dunked on with a big pair
of black fucking nuts...

01:17:25.350 --> 01:17:27.268
hanging on your forehead!

01:17:27.269 --> 01:17:29.270
Speaking of nuts...
Lucious.

01:17:29.271 --> 01:17:30.730
Come on up here, Lucious.

01:17:32.357 --> 01:17:34.609
Tell them.
How long is your dick?

01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:37.237
I don't know, Coach. Like a foot.

01:17:38.989 --> 01:17:40.198
Foot and a half.

01:17:40.323 --> 01:17:41.366
Foot and a ha...

01:17:43.577 --> 01:17:45.203
Foot and a half?

01:17:46.079 --> 01:17:48.205
Their arm ain't even that long!

01:17:48.206 --> 01:17:52.252
All right, let's kick some butt.
You scared?

01:17:52.377 --> 01:17:54.421
Well, well, well.

01:17:55.255 --> 01:17:57.256
You Negroes going
to play basketball, or what?

01:17:57.257 --> 01:18:00.427
Yeah, you Negroes.
What's the matter?

01:18:00.552 --> 01:18:04.347
Did you realize you didn't belong
in a white man's game, you Negroes?

01:18:04.389 --> 01:18:06.974
That's right. This isn't
a game for Negroes.

01:18:06.975 --> 01:18:11.353
It's a game for good, honest
white people, not for Negroes.

01:18:11.354 --> 01:18:13.231
You understand, Negroes?

01:18:14.357 --> 01:18:18.028
- White Knights!
- White Knights!

01:18:19.988 --> 01:18:21.363
Man, Coach, they looked tough.

01:18:21.364 --> 01:18:23.532
"They looked tough"?
I'm so scared!

01:18:23.533 --> 01:18:25.159
You know what they might do?

01:18:25.160 --> 01:18:28.621
One of them might dribble
with his left hand...

01:18:28.622 --> 01:18:31.373
all the way down the lane and then
go up for a left-handed layup...

01:18:31.374 --> 01:18:33.418
and you know what's going
to happen then?

01:18:34.044 --> 01:18:37.255
Your black ass is going
to swat that shit...

01:18:37.380 --> 01:18:42.426
jump over his cracker ass, and
dunk in his goddamn face!

01:18:42.427 --> 01:18:45.429
How many fucking times
do I have to tell you?

01:18:45.430 --> 01:18:49.643
You're black, they're white,
this ain't hockey!

01:18:50.310 --> 01:18:55.065
Guys, I think what Coach is trying to
say is that the key word is "teamwork."

01:18:55.440 --> 01:19:00.403
No, the key word is
"you're black, they're white"!

01:19:01.029 --> 01:19:03.614
So, Coach, what you're saying is,
if we just walk with the Lord...

01:19:03.615 --> 01:19:06.283
The Lord? Nigger, the Lord
done did his part already!

01:19:06.284 --> 01:19:09.454
He made you black.
He made them white.

01:19:09.704 --> 01:19:13.458
He gave you a foot-and-a-half dick!
Dribble with that motherfucker!

01:19:14.668 --> 01:19:17.087
As long as y'all are out
there on the floor...

01:19:17.420 --> 01:19:20.089
you're going to score more
points than them.

01:19:20.090 --> 01:19:22.342
That's just how basketball works!

01:19:27.430 --> 01:19:30.684
Cut that goddamn
slow clap shit out!

01:19:30.725 --> 01:19:33.228
Tries my motherfucking patience!

01:19:33.520 --> 01:19:35.313
Go out there and win!

01:19:36.356 --> 01:19:38.358
- Let's go!
- Come on!

01:20:05.510 --> 01:20:07.637
<i>It was a glorious game.</i>

01:20:08.513 --> 01:20:10.514
<i>But late in the fourth quarter...</i>

01:20:10.515 --> 01:20:14.393
<i>when Lucious Williams dribbled
the entire length of the court...</i>

01:20:14.394 --> 01:20:16.563
<i>with his foot-and-a-half penis...</i>

01:20:16.771 --> 01:20:20.400
<i>the referees had no choice
but to call a technical foul...</i>

01:20:21.026 --> 01:20:24.529
<i>sending young Bobby Lee Mayflower
to the line...</i>

01:20:24.696 --> 01:20:28.074
<i>for the most dramatic
moment of the contest.</i>

01:20:51.139 --> 01:20:52.431
Hey, guys. Hello.

01:20:52.432 --> 01:20:54.100
Who is that woman you are with?

01:20:54.309 --> 01:20:55.684
That's my mother.

01:20:55.685 --> 01:20:57.479
I want your mother.

01:21:01.107 --> 01:21:03.443
- Baxter, turn that shit off, man.
- Okay.

01:21:04.527 --> 01:21:06.207
I'm going to go to
the bathroom, all right?

01:21:12.577 --> 01:21:14.162
I can't fucking do it.

01:21:14.454 --> 01:21:17.206
<i>- I don't know, but I been told
- I don't know, but I been told</i>

01:21:17.207 --> 01:21:18.540
<i>Gym class gives you great big balls</i>

01:21:18.541 --> 01:21:19.584
<i>Gym class gives you...</i>

01:21:23.213 --> 01:21:24.505
Out here shooting the shit.

01:21:24.506 --> 01:21:28.343
Some guys shoot the shit, and some
people get shot with shit. Right?

01:21:28.510 --> 01:21:30.637
- Am I right?
- I don't know what he's talking about.

01:21:30.762 --> 01:21:32.429
You know what the fuck
I'm talking about.

01:21:32.430 --> 01:21:34.349
I want to be on you.

01:21:35.433 --> 01:21:36.768
In you.

01:21:38.770 --> 01:21:40.522
- Sorry. Fuck.
- Not a problem.

01:21:46.611 --> 01:21:47.612
No.

01:21:48.655 --> 01:21:51.241
No, I can just see him
underneath the table.

01:21:52.492 --> 01:21:54.972
And he's had his fingers in
my pussy for the last five minutes.

01:21:55.036 --> 01:21:58.373
It's monstrous. It looks like she's
sitting on Art Garfunkel's shoulders.

01:22:06.548 --> 01:22:09.509
No one leaves this room
till we figure this out.

01:22:11.511 --> 01:22:13.554
Mangled dicks. Mangled...

01:22:13.555 --> 01:22:15.722
Dicks, dicks, dicks, dicks...

01:22:15.723 --> 01:22:18.350
- Mangled dicks.
- Mangled dicks. Mangled...

01:22:18.351 --> 01:22:20.520
- Dicks.
- Dicks.

01:22:20.603 --> 01:22:22.187
I got frozen peas and a sponge.

01:22:22.188 --> 01:22:24.398
No, Mikey, there's steel
wool on one side.

01:22:24.399 --> 01:22:25.566
Shit, you're right.

01:22:25.567 --> 01:22:28.193
Okay, Amanda, you're going to want
to keep the yellow side up.

01:22:28.194 --> 01:22:30.113
Otherwise, there's going
to be lots more blood.

01:22:38.538 --> 01:22:40.540
I suck cock for gold coins.

01:22:42.041 --> 01:22:43.543
So do I.

01:22:56.264 --> 01:22:59.224
So what you're saying is, if we go
out there and give 110 percent...

01:22:59.225 --> 01:23:02.436
A hundred and ten percent!
Fifty percent! Three percent!

01:23:02.437 --> 01:23:05.648
I think what Coach is trying to say is
that the key word here is "teamwork."

01:23:05.732 --> 01:23:09.235
Lucious, will you whip out your dick
and smack this motherfucker with it?

01:23:10.737 --> 01:23:12.446
- What?
- I love you even more.

01:23:12.447 --> 01:23:14.532
- Oh, Anson.
- I do.

01:23:14.991 --> 01:23:16.618
- Me, too.
- You do?

01:23:21.998 --> 01:23:25.126
<i>He's America's favorite cat...
Beezel</i>

01:23:31.549 --> 01:23:33.467
<i>I'm embarrassed to even
say this, but...</i>

01:23:33.468 --> 01:23:34.636
<i>What?</i>

01:23:35.386 --> 01:23:37.555
Amy, ever since you moved
in here, I...

01:23:38.681 --> 01:23:40.474
- What?
- I love you even more.

01:23:40.475 --> 01:23:42.435
- Oh, Anson.
- I do.

01:23:42.477 --> 01:23:44.354
- Me, too.
- You do?

01:23:47.732 --> 01:23:50.235
Beezel! How are you?

01:23:50.693 --> 01:23:53.071
How is my handsome little boy?

01:23:59.035 --> 01:24:03.497
Hey, Anson, do you ever feel like
your relationship with Beezel...

01:24:03.498 --> 01:24:05.291
is a little strange?

01:24:05.708 --> 01:24:06.709
Amy!

01:24:07.585 --> 01:24:09.378
Please don't tell me
you're one of those girls...

01:24:09.379 --> 01:24:11.339
that gets jealous of a guy's pet!

01:24:11.464 --> 01:24:14.592
Even if that pet is thuper thilly!

01:24:15.051 --> 01:24:18.637
No, no. I just don't think
he likes me very much.

01:24:18.638 --> 01:24:21.306
Come on, Amy. He loves you!

01:24:21.307 --> 01:24:22.684
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:24:23.309 --> 01:24:24.477
There we go.

01:24:26.771 --> 01:24:28.356
Now, where were we?

01:24:37.615 --> 01:24:39.033
What's wrong?

01:24:41.619 --> 01:24:42.662
Nothing.

01:25:29.709 --> 01:25:31.711
Get off of me!

01:25:58.696 --> 01:26:00.406
- What happened?
- Beezel...

01:26:00.740 --> 01:26:03.576
pissed all over me!

01:26:03.993 --> 01:26:05.995
Oh, no, he just sprayed you.

01:26:06.120 --> 01:26:09.706
It's something male cats do sometimes.
It means he likes you.

01:26:09.707 --> 01:26:11.583
- He likes me?
- Yeah.

01:26:11.584 --> 01:26:14.712
Or it could mean that he's sick.
Buddy, are you sick?

01:26:14.754 --> 01:26:17.381
Anson, he did this on purpose!

01:26:17.382 --> 01:26:21.093
- I caught him masturbating.
- He was probably just cleaning himself.

01:26:21.094 --> 01:26:24.638
It was to pictures of you
in a swimsuit!

01:26:24.639 --> 01:26:27.140
Cats can't even process
images in that way.

01:26:27.141 --> 01:26:29.726
But he is not a normal cat.

01:26:29.727 --> 01:26:30.977
Of course he is.

01:26:30.978 --> 01:26:34.107
He just put a fucking
thermometer in his mouth!

01:26:34.315 --> 01:26:35.650
He thinks it's a toy.

01:26:40.405 --> 01:26:41.739
Oh, Beezel.

01:26:43.616 --> 01:26:45.617
Anson. I love you.

01:26:45.618 --> 01:26:48.620
I do, but as long as that
little fucker is around...

01:26:48.621 --> 01:26:50.206
I cannot be with you.

01:26:50.373 --> 01:26:52.667
No, Amy, Amy. Look.

01:26:54.001 --> 01:26:56.545
If it'll make you happy,
I'll find another home for Beezel.

01:26:56.546 --> 01:26:57.755
He's just a cat.

01:26:58.965 --> 01:27:00.133
But you...

01:27:01.342 --> 01:27:02.760
you're the woman that I love.

01:27:04.554 --> 01:27:07.473
- You'd get rid of him?
- I will.

01:27:07.765 --> 01:27:09.474
- I love you.
- I love you.

01:27:09.475 --> 01:27:10.685
No, I love you.

01:27:34.500 --> 01:27:37.044
<i>Beezel, where are you, boy?</i>

01:27:37.378 --> 01:27:39.338
Come out, come out,
you little rat-fucker.

01:27:40.173 --> 01:27:41.466
Beezel!

01:27:43.092 --> 01:27:46.470
Shit, I told my mother we'd
have him there in an hour.

01:27:46.471 --> 01:27:49.056
She was nice enough
to take him off our hands.

01:27:49.432 --> 01:27:52.143
- Do you mind checking outside for him?
- Absolutely.

01:27:52.435 --> 01:27:53.686
I'm going to go upstairs.

01:27:56.731 --> 01:27:58.107
Beezel?

01:28:34.101 --> 01:28:37.563
That's it, you son of a bitch!

01:28:41.108 --> 01:28:43.110
Cock-sucking...

01:28:44.028 --> 01:28:45.737
motherfucking...

01:28:45.738 --> 01:28:48.574
Garfield reject piece of shit!

01:28:52.161 --> 01:28:54.330
Die, you...

01:28:55.164 --> 01:28:58.084
dick-loving devil cat!

01:29:05.508 --> 01:29:08.135
What?

01:29:09.762 --> 01:29:11.097
Don't look.

01:29:11.514 --> 01:29:14.308
Mommy, she's beating that cat...

01:29:15.059 --> 01:29:16.102
to death!

01:29:17.311 --> 01:29:19.063
He tried to kill me.

01:29:19.355 --> 01:29:21.190
No, you don't understand.

01:29:21.524 --> 01:29:24.068
You don't understand.

01:29:28.030 --> 01:29:29.407
Please.

01:29:31.492 --> 01:29:33.035
Get her!
