02:29.516 --> 02:33.782
People always talk about fate.
Destiny.

02:33.953 --> 02:38.617
I never used to believe in that. Some
things are just out of your control.

02:38.791 --> 02:42.158
Like my parents.
They died when I was 18.

02:42.328 --> 02:45.229
There was nothing I could do
about that.

02:46.065 --> 02:48.590
But was that fate?

02:50.303 --> 02:53.363
Then you would have to say
everything was fate.

02:54.007 --> 02:56.441
Who you spend your life with.

02:56.676 --> 02:59.144
What you end up doing for a living.

02:59.312 --> 03:04.045
Is what happens prepackaged
and served to me by a higher power?

03:04.217 --> 03:07.778
I didn't think so,
but there has to be some explanation.

03:07.954 --> 03:11.583
Because my life was totally different
a couple weeks ago.

03:13.326 --> 03:16.352
- I went to the bank today.
- Yeah?

03:16.529 --> 03:19.760
- Have you checked our balance lately?
- No.

03:27.173 --> 03:30.802
We have exactly $30,006.

03:31.744 --> 03:33.268
We can get married!

03:33.580 --> 03:34.808
Yes.

03:39.819 --> 03:43.983
I know you thought it was silly
to wait until we had this money...

03:44.157 --> 03:48.059
...before we got married, but now
we can put a payment on a house...

03:48.228 --> 03:51.527
...we can plan a family...
- Elaine was incredible.

03:51.698 --> 03:53.097
I'm so happy.

03:54.133 --> 03:55.657
Not here.

03:56.269 --> 04:00.797
- You can kiss me at home.
- Although she did have one odd habit.

04:01.341 --> 04:03.434
She cried when we made love.

04:03.610 --> 04:07.637
Very loud crying, which
made it kind of tough to concentrate.

04:07.814 --> 04:08.940
Are you okay?

04:10.116 --> 04:11.913
- Bye, sweetie.
- Bye.

04:12.085 --> 04:16.283
She ran a gift-basket business.
It was about to turn the corner.

04:16.589 --> 04:19.887
And I was the assistant manager
at Homespital...

04:20.059 --> 04:23.688
...a store that sold medical supplies
for the home.

04:27.033 --> 04:30.969
I know it's a lot of money, sir,
but it's a lot of chair.

04:31.137 --> 04:34.698
- John? In my office.
- Excuse me.

04:37.010 --> 04:42.004
If there was one problem, it was that I
worked for Elaine's father, Mr. Warner.

04:43.049 --> 04:46.644
There always seemed to be
an unspoken tension between us.

04:47.186 --> 04:51.213
John-boy! Come on in. Sit down.

04:51.391 --> 04:54.554
My little girl told me the big news.

04:54.727 --> 04:57.890
- Well, I'm glad, John. I'm really glad.
- Yes, sir!

04:58.064 --> 05:00.555
He wasn't glad. He hated me.

05:00.733 --> 05:05.670
I think he even trained his dog, Rex,
to hate me too.

05:06.506 --> 05:09.873
You're an honorable kid.
You don't see that these days.

05:10.043 --> 05:14.173
I appreciate that you have been
true to your word to me...

05:14.347 --> 05:18.750
...and that you have not
slept with my daughter.

05:18.918 --> 05:21.284
Have you slept with her, John?

05:25.291 --> 05:28.886
- No, sir.
- Okay, all right. I'll tell you what.

05:29.062 --> 05:32.156
I'm gonna give you
a few seconds of immunity.

05:32.332 --> 05:38.430
If you've slept with her, tell me here,
tell me now, and we'll let it go.

05:38.604 --> 05:41.368
Have you slept with my daughter?

05:42.241 --> 05:45.836
Mr. Warner,
I have never slept with Elaine.

05:46.145 --> 05:48.705
Good! Goddamn it, that's good.

05:48.881 --> 05:52.510
If you had, I was gonna kick
your balls into your head...

05:52.685 --> 05:57.088
...and let them rattle in your skull
like dice in a cup. Have a good one.

05:57.357 --> 06:01.851
To be completely honest,
he sort of gave me the creeps.

06:02.428 --> 06:06.023
He had a slightly weird relationship
with his daughter.

06:07.233 --> 06:10.725
But aside from that and my job...

06:10.903 --> 06:12.700
...life was pretty good.

06:13.239 --> 06:16.299
- Hi.
- Hi. John, look at this biscuit basket.

06:16.476 --> 06:20.310
- Think the biscotti makes it look busy?
- No, it looks great.

06:20.480 --> 06:22.573
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

06:23.149 --> 06:26.676
It does look good.
I'm proud of this basket.

06:26.853 --> 06:29.651
- You should be. It's good work.
- Thank you.

06:31.958 --> 06:34.984
- We should head to my sister's soon.
- Oh, yeah.

06:35.661 --> 06:37.128
I'm not going.

06:38.731 --> 06:41.529
Elaine never liked my sister, Patty.

06:41.701 --> 06:44.363
Maybe it's because
Patty was a free spirit.

06:44.537 --> 06:48.268
I say free spirit because
I'm uncomfortable calling her...

06:48.574 --> 06:52.169
...sexually indiscriminate trailer trash.

06:52.412 --> 06:54.607
- Hey, Patty!
- Where's Elaine?

06:54.981 --> 06:56.175
Headache.

06:56.349 --> 06:59.785
Poor thing.
Probably from being such a bitch 24l7.

06:59.952 --> 07:02.318
You know, she really likes you.

07:02.488 --> 07:05.116
And I'm growing a dick,
how about that?

07:07.427 --> 07:10.692
Elaine wanted me to give you
this gift basket.

07:10.863 --> 07:12.626
God! Fantastic!

07:13.065 --> 07:16.262
Because this one was starting to reek.

07:17.737 --> 07:20.706
- Thanks.
- I hope you didn't clean on my account.

07:20.873 --> 07:25.469
Hey, you know what? It has been
crazy around here, all right?

07:25.912 --> 07:30.008
Both of the cats ran away.
Both of them. Two cats, MIA.

07:30.183 --> 07:33.675
- What would make them do that?
- Self-respect?

07:34.153 --> 07:36.144
- Hi, Uncle John!
- Hey!

07:36.322 --> 07:39.120
Noreen's my niece.
We're not sure who her dad is...

07:39.325 --> 07:41.919
...so I spent as much time with her
as I could.

07:42.094 --> 07:46.463
- Happy Halloween!
- Hi! What are you?

07:46.632 --> 07:49.601
I'm the Statue of Liberty.

07:51.237 --> 07:55.333
You could say I'm the closest thing
she has to a father figure.

07:56.676 --> 07:58.473
- Good luck!
- Thanks, Uncle John!

07:58.644 --> 08:01.772
Come on! These carcasses
don't move themselves.

08:01.948 --> 08:05.543
And I'm proud to say,
she turned out to be a great kid.

08:05.718 --> 08:08.551
Genuine, hard-working...

08:08.721 --> 08:13.055
...and in spite of everything that had
happened around her, normal.

08:13.226 --> 08:15.387
- Hi.
- Why are we watching these?

08:15.561 --> 08:19.691
We're celebrating. Noreen has news.

08:20.967 --> 08:24.198
- Please tell me you're not pregnant.
- Uncle John!

08:25.004 --> 08:26.631
Here we go! Remember this?

08:26.806 --> 08:31.004
Hi. Sorry I'm late. Traffic.
Has the spelling bee started yet?

08:31.177 --> 08:32.508
She's already out.

08:32.678 --> 08:36.739
Got her on the first word.
It was rigged. I'm writing a letter!

08:36.916 --> 08:39.179
Noreen. I'm sorry.

08:39.352 --> 08:43.549
- What was the word she misspelled?
- Tarp.

08:44.624 --> 08:47.388
- Tarp?
- Yeah.

08:47.560 --> 08:49.551
T-A-R-P?

08:49.729 --> 08:52.926
Great.
Where were you five minutes ago?

08:53.799 --> 08:57.291
- I'm stupid.
- No, you're not. You're smart.

08:57.470 --> 08:59.438
- Yes.
- You'll do great in school...

08:59.605 --> 09:03.564
...you're gonna go to college,
you're gonna be brilliant.

09:04.110 --> 09:07.204
Well, Uncle John, you were half right.

09:07.380 --> 09:11.680
I don't know if I'm brilliant,
but guess who got into Harvard?

09:11.851 --> 09:13.409
- I can't believe it!
- What?

09:13.586 --> 09:17.078
- I got accepted to Harvard University!
- You're kidding!

09:17.256 --> 09:20.191
That's what this is about?
That's incredible!

09:20.359 --> 09:25.126
- I know!
- My little goddamned genius!

09:25.965 --> 09:27.660
See? What did I tell you?

09:27.833 --> 09:32.327
You work hard and follow your dreams,
and things will always work out.

09:32.505 --> 09:34.200
You were right.

09:34.473 --> 09:37.965
- Bet you're sorry you promised.
- What promise?

09:38.144 --> 09:40.578
Wait! Here it comes. My favorite part.

09:41.614 --> 09:44.845
I'm never gonna go into college now.

09:45.017 --> 09:48.612
Yes, you will. I guarantee it.

09:48.788 --> 09:51.814
I believe in you so much,
know what I'm gonna do?

09:51.991 --> 09:54.186
- What?
- I'm paying for it.

09:54.360 --> 09:57.454
You get into college,
and I'll pay for it.

09:57.630 --> 10:01.464
And that's a promise
from your Uncle John.

10:04.403 --> 10:06.530
I'll be right back.

10:10.810 --> 10:14.405
Idiot! Idiot! Idiot! Idiot!

10:17.316 --> 10:22.344
You know, Noreen, a lot of kids
are just taking a year off these days.

10:23.289 --> 10:24.756
Ever think about that?

10:24.924 --> 10:29.520
Traveling? Seeing Asia? Lot of people
there. Must be something to it.

10:29.695 --> 10:33.290
- Do you not want me to go to Harvard?
- What? No!

10:33.466 --> 10:37.732
I just think there's value to being
on the road with nothing but $ 100.

10:37.903 --> 10:39.632
Hell, I'll give you $ 100.

10:39.939 --> 10:42.032
If it's about money, don't worry.

10:42.208 --> 10:45.837
I've saved almost everything
I've ever earned for this.

10:46.012 --> 10:50.005
Plus, I get financial aid,
so it's all pretty much paid for...

10:50.182 --> 10:53.515
...except one little chunk.
- Good!

10:53.686 --> 10:59.716
- How much more money do you need?
- $29,879.

11:00.559 --> 11:02.151
That's the small chunk?

11:03.696 --> 11:05.493
It's expensive.

11:06.365 --> 11:07.889
Found one.

11:09.068 --> 11:11.696
And we need the money by the 15th.

11:11.871 --> 11:16.001
Yeah. There's our Mr. Biscuits.

11:18.644 --> 11:21.875
I have to go. Yeah, he just walked in.

11:22.248 --> 11:26.651
I didn't know how to do it, but
I had to tell Elaine our house fund...

11:26.819 --> 11:29.754
...had just become Noreen's
college fund.

11:30.589 --> 11:32.523
So how was Patty's?

11:32.692 --> 11:34.785
Really nice.

11:35.361 --> 11:38.922
- You know, Noreen's a great kid.
- Yeah.

11:39.098 --> 11:41.896
So much raw potential.

11:42.068 --> 11:47.404
- Boy, with the right opportunities...
- So I found this great house today.

11:48.007 --> 11:49.975
What do you think?

11:51.043 --> 11:55.980
It's great. It's a charming starter house
on a spectacular tree-lined street...

11:56.148 --> 11:59.515
...and it has hardwood cabinets.
And I love it.

11:59.685 --> 12:03.712
If you go by and like it too,
then maybe we could...

12:05.558 --> 12:08.152
Don't you think we're
moving fast here?

12:08.327 --> 12:13.128
John. I know it seems scary to be
spending all this money on a house...

12:13.299 --> 12:16.530
...but that's what we've
been saving for.

12:16.702 --> 12:20.638
My mom and dad fought about money,
but that can't happen to us...

12:20.806 --> 12:23.536
...because we have $30,000...

12:23.709 --> 12:29.341
...for our house. Our home.
Our future.

12:29.515 --> 12:33.349
And no one can take that
away from us.

12:34.286 --> 12:36.481
That's what I meant.

12:37.957 --> 12:42.485
So Noreen got into college, and
Elaine had found our dream house.

12:42.928 --> 12:47.922
These wonderful things were locked
in a struggle for the same money.

12:48.701 --> 12:51.431
Not $30, $30,000.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.333
I had to try and borrow it.

12:53.672 --> 12:55.867
- Hello, dear.
- I called my Aunt Jean:

12:56.041 --> 12:58.509
- No!
- My Uncle Dave:

12:58.677 --> 13:01.771
- No!
- And my grandmother:

13:01.947 --> 13:05.439
Who do you think I am?
Albert fucking Trump?

13:06.986 --> 13:11.582
It was my last option. A man whose
ideas were sometimes so dumb...

13:11.757 --> 13:15.659
...they were brilliant.
I had to go to Duff.

13:22.268 --> 13:24.828
Hey, man, how you been?

13:28.541 --> 13:34.844
John. Been almost two months. Did
you disappear off the face of the earth?

13:35.181 --> 13:37.479
- I've just been busy.
- I've been busy...

13:37.650 --> 13:41.142
...with my landscaping company,
Landscape Escape.

13:41.320 --> 13:45.518
Doesn't mean I have to go and
disappear off the face of the earth.

13:48.627 --> 13:52.495
- I can't stay mad at you, man.
- Duff! You burned me.

13:52.665 --> 13:55.031
John! John!

13:58.804 --> 14:01.102
- Tarp?
- Yep.

14:01.273 --> 14:03.741
- Like a tarpaulin?
- No, just tarp.

14:03.943 --> 14:06.377
Who can't spell tarp, Duff?

14:12.218 --> 14:16.587
Duff? Don't you think you're
taking a little too much off the top?

14:16.755 --> 14:18.416
I know what I'm doing.

14:18.591 --> 14:23.790
I have to taper it so light reaches the
lower leaves during growing season.

14:26.298 --> 14:29.165
But what about this string?

14:30.903 --> 14:34.771
This string is a guide, John.
It's just a guide.

14:35.241 --> 14:38.972
- I don't know what I'm gonna do.
- Know what your problem is?

14:39.144 --> 14:43.706
You don't understand an oath is an
oath. You made an oath to your niece.

14:43.883 --> 14:45.373
No, I didn't.

14:45.551 --> 14:48.418
It was just an offhand remark.

14:49.121 --> 14:51.487
- How much money you got?
- 30,000.

14:51.657 --> 14:54.592
But that's for buying
Elaine a house.

14:54.760 --> 15:00.027
Right. Look, I'm your friend. I feel
like I can talk straight with you.

15:00.199 --> 15:04.932
Elaine, I like her. I like her a lot,
John. But she's a bitch!

15:05.104 --> 15:08.471
- She's a dirty, dumb bitch!
- Duff! Come on.

15:08.641 --> 15:13.305
There are more productive things to do
with money besides buying a house.

15:13.479 --> 15:15.037
- Such as?
- Such as...

15:15.214 --> 15:18.274
...putting it in a bag and
throwing it off a cliff.

15:18.484 --> 15:22.284
And that's just coming off
the top of my head.

15:23.389 --> 15:26.790
- I do know how you can get the money.
- How?

15:31.363 --> 15:34.332
You take $ 1000,
you go to the horse racetrack...

15:34.500 --> 15:37.492
...you put it on a 30-to-1.
- What's wrong with you?

15:37.670 --> 15:41.436
John, it's been done, man.
Kevin Darnell, remember him?

15:41.607 --> 15:44.940
He put money down, won,
and bought a used DeLorean.

15:45.110 --> 15:49.012
He crashed it and died, but
he did get money. It can happen.

15:49.181 --> 15:53.777
I was hoping for something just
this side of theoretically possible.

15:54.219 --> 15:55.914
You know any criminals?

15:56.088 --> 16:01.720
Because, you know,
criminals have lots of money.

16:01.894 --> 16:03.521
How about David Loach?

16:03.696 --> 16:06.824
David Loach from high school?
That guy's a psycho.

16:06.999 --> 16:10.765
You know what your problem is?
You're mentally inflexible.

16:10.936 --> 16:15.737
- Duff, I hate to ask, but...
- John, I'm not rich, you know.

16:15.908 --> 16:21.744
I may look it because of my expensive
tools and my wonderful truck.

16:22.314 --> 16:27.149
I'm like Bill Gates. He may be the
richest, but he doesn't have money.

16:27.319 --> 16:31.653
It's all tied up in stocks.
I'm not liquid, John.

16:31.824 --> 16:36.727
- I'm not liquid.
- What does that mean?

16:36.895 --> 16:40.331
It means I don't have any money
for you, man.

16:42.401 --> 16:46.770
Duff couldn't give me money,
but he could certainly give me advice.

16:47.172 --> 16:51.336
Know what your problem is? You don't
take responsibility seriously.

16:51.510 --> 16:55.674
Maybe you should have thought
before you went and became an uncle!

16:55.848 --> 17:01.252
I'm doing my best, Duff. I know she's
overcome a lot to turn out normal.

17:01.420 --> 17:04.287
There haven't been many people
who helped her.

17:04.455 --> 17:06.185
- Yeah.
- But you know what?

17:06.358 --> 17:10.988
I'm gonna be one of them.
If I don't come through for her now...

17:11.163 --> 17:16.260
...it's possible she could lose faith
or whatever she's got that's working.

17:16.435 --> 17:21.463
I'm getting that money, Duff.
Even if I have to go to David Loach.

17:21.640 --> 17:24.336
You're not gonna
have to go to David Loach.

17:24.510 --> 17:26.773
I've got another idea.

17:27.646 --> 17:28.977
Can you get the beer?

17:33.452 --> 17:37.149
Hey, kids. Duff's Dial-A-Bottle.
Time to party.

17:37.456 --> 17:40.550
- It'll be 20 each.
- I thought it was 15.

17:40.726 --> 17:42.921
That's what the flyer says.

17:43.629 --> 17:48.362
But the fine print says "prices subject
to change." Read the flyer.

17:48.534 --> 17:51.503
You happy? You scum!
Give me the money.

17:51.670 --> 17:55.606
I'm not making money. Do I look rich?
I barely break even. Go!

17:55.774 --> 17:58.902
You skunks! You pukes!
Read the fine print.

17:59.078 --> 18:03.208
That is the most irresponsible thing
I've ever seen you do.

18:03.382 --> 18:05.942
Look, I provide a public service, John.

18:07.186 --> 18:10.053
One way or another,
they were gonna get drunk.

18:10.222 --> 18:14.124
Maybe they would have
drank mouthwash or sniffed glue...

18:14.293 --> 18:18.491
...but, you know, they wanted beer.
Those are good, honest kids.

18:18.664 --> 18:22.327
They deliver newspapers,
return old pop bottles all week...

18:22.501 --> 18:28.030
They deserve to unwind and get drunk.
It's all part of the American dream.

18:30.876 --> 18:33.936
Your American dream
just gave you the finger.

18:35.714 --> 18:37.739
It's their freedom.

18:44.056 --> 18:46.081
Jesus, Duff!

18:49.928 --> 18:52.328
Here are your briefs, Walter.
Hi, John.

18:52.498 --> 18:55.023
- Hi, Mrs. Duffy.
- How are your folks, John?

18:55.200 --> 18:57.031
Dead. Still.

18:57.202 --> 19:01.696
I forgot. I'm so sorry. I'm on
medication and it makes me loopy.

19:01.874 --> 19:04.843
- Mom!
- Say hi to your folks, John.

19:05.711 --> 19:08.077
You have to forgive her.

19:08.247 --> 19:12.206
She's been going through empty nest
syndrome since I moved out.

19:12.384 --> 19:14.909
Moved out?
You're 20 feet from the house.

19:15.087 --> 19:17.715
Yeah. And I love the freedom.

19:18.423 --> 19:21.756
I could keep these beauties on
as late as I want.

19:21.994 --> 19:23.621
Great.

19:25.430 --> 19:27.091
John...

19:28.100 --> 19:30.534
I have a client.

19:30.702 --> 19:34.194
Lives over
in the Pembroke Hills Estates area.

19:34.473 --> 19:40.173
Guy's loaded. Last week,
I was just finishing up a job...

19:40.646 --> 19:45.481
But I thought I'd do one last round
of the property. You know, details?

19:47.920 --> 19:53.620
Inspection is important to me. Thought
I'd check out the whole interior.

19:53.792 --> 19:59.094
Although I'm an exterior landscaper,
John, I also do interior work.

20:01.333 --> 20:05.394
I was hungry, so I thought
I'd heat up a brick of cheese.

20:09.141 --> 20:11.336
I need my cheese!

20:12.911 --> 20:16.312
But, John,
I heard something upstairs...

20:16.481 --> 20:19.780
...and I thought,
"I should check this out. "

20:19.952 --> 20:23.718
So I went to look around and
I saw this painting on the wall...

20:23.889 --> 20:26.551
...and something didn't seem right
about it.

20:26.725 --> 20:30.354
And I touched it, and it moved.

20:30.529 --> 20:34.295
And behind the painting,
there was this safe.

20:34.466 --> 20:39.529
But I heard someone coming,
so I gracefully slipped out.

20:41.139 --> 20:45.803
But the best part, John,
is the safe...

20:45.978 --> 20:48.879
...it wasn't even locked.
- Nope.

20:49.047 --> 20:53.245
You turn this corner,
and it's the whole slippery slope.

20:53.418 --> 20:56.546
Your whole moral code
goes out the window. No way.

20:56.722 --> 21:00.818
Look. Is it moral to let some fat,
greasy man roll around naked...

21:00.993 --> 21:04.861
...in a pile of cash when
it could be used for something good...

21:05.030 --> 21:08.261
...like sending Noreen to college?

21:12.037 --> 21:15.029
- We can't.
- The guy's never home Sunday nights.

21:15.207 --> 21:18.040
Sunday we go there,
slip through the window...

21:18.210 --> 21:22.340
...which I accidentally left unlocked
today.

21:22.514 --> 21:25.142
And we grab the money.

21:26.485 --> 21:29.943
- The guy won't miss the money?
- Heard of insurance?

21:30.122 --> 21:32.750
Heard of insurance?
It's called insurance.

21:32.991 --> 21:36.392
He's not gonna miss the money.
He's not gonna pay.

21:36.561 --> 21:39.496
The insurance guys
are gonna have to pay.

21:39.665 --> 21:42.259
And they deserve to pay!

21:43.235 --> 21:45.396
Bastards.

21:50.142 --> 21:52.110
Bastards.

21:56.948 --> 21:59.542
Where are you going?

21:59.718 --> 22:01.811
- Why are you here?
- I live here.

22:01.987 --> 22:05.650
- I thought you were going to a movie.
- That was last night.

22:05.824 --> 22:11.490
- We're supposed look at that house.
- I can't. I've gotta go out.

22:11.663 --> 22:15.724
Why are you all dressed in black?
Are you going to rob a bank?

22:18.136 --> 22:23.096
No, baby. I'm Johnny Cash. Hello.

22:24.876 --> 22:28.437
But I'll look at the house
on the way home. Okay?

22:28.613 --> 22:31.810
Soon as I'm done robbing that bank.

22:32.250 --> 22:34.480
Have a good time.

22:43.061 --> 22:47.157
- Okay. Ready?
- Yeah. Let's go.

22:50.102 --> 22:51.569
Sorry.

22:52.571 --> 22:54.232
All right.

22:57.943 --> 23:01.379
- Here we go.
- Let's go. Let's go, let's go.

23:02.814 --> 23:05.442
- Under the fence.
- Wait.

23:05.617 --> 23:07.710
Go. Go. Go.

23:08.320 --> 23:11.118
What are you doing? It's open.

23:12.357 --> 23:16.623
John. See those dead bushes?
I planted those.

23:20.599 --> 23:23.432
- That's the window there.
- Who should go first?

23:23.602 --> 23:25.627
- I'm not going in.
- What?

23:25.804 --> 23:28.466
Someone has to watch in case
he comes home.

23:28.640 --> 23:31.006
- You said he would be out.
- He will be.

23:31.176 --> 23:34.543
- Then why do we need a lookout?
- We don't. Just go in.

23:34.713 --> 23:38.012
- You go in.
- I don't need money. Why risk it?

23:38.250 --> 23:40.878
- What risk?
- There is no risk.

23:42.754 --> 23:44.654
Just go!

24:05.610 --> 24:08.875
- Crap! John.
- Hello?

24:09.047 --> 24:10.776
John!

24:12.617 --> 24:14.676
Good luck, buddy.

24:32.370 --> 24:36.500
Well, well. What have we here?

24:36.675 --> 24:40.634
- Please don't shoot me.
- I'm not going to shoot you.

24:41.746 --> 24:44.715
- Are you gonna call the police?
- No.

24:47.252 --> 24:48.719
What are you gonna do?

24:48.920 --> 24:51.855
My wife died several years ago,
and it's...

24:52.023 --> 24:54.651
It's really nice
to have someone around.

25:04.536 --> 25:07.937
- Now what?
- Now we're going to spoon.

25:08.940 --> 25:10.430
Spoon?

25:10.675 --> 25:14.975
You remember when we went
to Nova Scotia that spring...

25:15.146 --> 25:20.174
...and we had those sand dabs
at that restaurant on the bay?

25:21.419 --> 25:25.321
- Yes.
- Weren't they tasty?

25:26.725 --> 25:28.283
Yes.

25:28.460 --> 25:32.055
I don't think we've ever had sand dabs
that tasty again.

25:32.230 --> 25:35.290
- Remember the boat ride over?
- Yes.

25:35.467 --> 25:37.230
We drove.

25:38.069 --> 25:39.661
Oh, yeah.

25:42.040 --> 25:45.305
Happy times. Turn.

25:50.849 --> 25:52.942
The petting zoo...

25:53.952 --> 25:58.218
All right. Now we do the photo shoot.

25:59.224 --> 26:01.215
Oh, my God.

26:10.735 --> 26:13.135
It won't do you any good
to tell anyone.

26:13.338 --> 26:18.366
I'm a respected member of the
community. No one will believe you.

26:20.245 --> 26:21.940
A mint?

26:26.117 --> 26:28.244
I'm not gay.

26:29.588 --> 26:31.818
I miss her very much...

26:31.990 --> 26:37.223
...and I haven't been able
to properly grieve and let go.

26:40.231 --> 26:43.257
- Do you understand?
- Yeah.

26:49.741 --> 26:52.676
Catch you around here again,
I'll kill you!

27:13.698 --> 27:18.192
That was enough. I had to tell Elaine
that Noreen needed our money.

27:18.370 --> 27:21.305
And no matter how unpleasant
that would be...

27:21.473 --> 27:24.931
...it couldn't hold a candle
to the fetish I just endured.

27:25.110 --> 27:26.702
Hi.

27:28.213 --> 27:29.805
Hi.

27:31.282 --> 27:33.512
I'm gonna go take a shower.

27:33.685 --> 27:38.054
Wait. Don't you think you should tell
me what happened at that house?

27:38.223 --> 27:39.713
What?

27:44.396 --> 27:47.092
You said you were gonna
look at that house.

27:49.267 --> 27:52.862
That house.
Yeah, I looked at it.

27:53.038 --> 27:57.134
- It was great. Great.
- Oh, God.

27:57.308 --> 28:00.209
I am so glad you liked it.

28:01.813 --> 28:04.008
Because I did something bad.

28:04.182 --> 28:08.414
I can't even believe I did this,
but I put in an offer.

28:08.586 --> 28:12.488
- What do you mean?
- I know. It seems so impulsive.

28:12.657 --> 28:17.424
But I just love the house so much,
and you do too, so...

28:17.595 --> 28:21.588
- What about the $30,000?
- It's gone!

28:21.766 --> 28:27.432
All of it. In escrow. And we find out
tomorrow if they accept the offer.

28:27.605 --> 28:32.042
Isn't it exciting? Everything is
working out exactly like we planned.

28:32.210 --> 28:34.644
Aren't you thrilled?

28:36.181 --> 28:38.240
- Yeah.
- You don't look thrilled.

28:38.683 --> 28:41.311
I'm in happy shock.

28:44.155 --> 28:46.453
Duff! You left me there.

28:46.691 --> 28:49.091
You said he wasn't home
Sunday nights.

28:49.260 --> 28:52.320
I tried to warn you.
What happened?

28:52.597 --> 28:56.693
Nothing. Absolutely nothing happened
at all.

28:56.968 --> 28:59.766
If nothing happened,
why are you so angry?

28:59.938 --> 29:04.773
Elaine put in an offer on this house.
If they accept, our money's locked up.

29:04.943 --> 29:08.037
"Sorry, Noreen. Hope you like
working at Dairy Queen."

29:08.213 --> 29:10.875
Mr. Warner wants to see you
in his office.

29:11.049 --> 29:12.846
Thanks, Loretta.

29:20.492 --> 29:24.087
I'm calling regarding the property
on Hyden Street.

29:24.262 --> 29:26.856
I'd like to put in an offer.

29:27.799 --> 29:30.927
You have an offer already now,
do you?

29:31.102 --> 29:34.503
Well, perhaps I could throw my hat
into the ring.

29:38.643 --> 29:41.203
John. Come on in.

29:42.647 --> 29:44.808
So, John-boy...

29:45.650 --> 29:49.484
What did you and my little girl
do last night?

29:49.654 --> 29:52.589
- Hung out, watched television.
- Really?

29:52.757 --> 29:57.194
That's funny. I was visiting a friend
near Pembroke Heights last night...

29:57.362 --> 30:00.854
...9:30, 9:45,
and I thought I saw you...

30:01.032 --> 30:04.365
...run out of somebody's house
like a bat out of hell.

30:04.536 --> 30:08.404
I saw you, John. Rex saw you.

30:10.675 --> 30:12.472
- No.
- No, John?

30:12.644 --> 30:15.613
Odd. It looked just like you,
and guess what?

30:15.780 --> 30:18.715
He got into a car
looked just like your car.

30:18.883 --> 30:20.282
Interesting.

30:20.785 --> 30:25.484
You wouldn't lie to me. So I guess
my eyes were playing tricks on me.

30:25.657 --> 30:29.684
I'll just have to watch what's
going on more carefully, won't I?

30:34.599 --> 30:37.534
- You won't have to watch...
- Watch what?

30:37.702 --> 30:40.728
I won't have to watch what?
Go ahead, say it.

30:41.506 --> 30:43.098
- I should...
- Say it!

30:43.908 --> 30:45.102
Confess!

30:45.276 --> 30:48.507
I really need to get back to work.

30:51.449 --> 30:52.973
We know.

30:54.352 --> 30:56.786
We know, don't we, Rex?

30:58.590 --> 31:03.425
Okay. I see what's going on here.
You think you're Mr. Real Estate.

31:03.595 --> 31:07.087
That's great. Let me ask you this:
Do you have any kids?

31:07.265 --> 31:10.598
Good. Three of them?
Well, that's even better.

31:10.768 --> 31:14.397
Because I want an audience
when I come over, take you out...

31:14.572 --> 31:17.564
...and beat the living bejesus
out of you!

31:23.681 --> 31:28.618
- I was putting an offer on your house.
- Great. How'd that go?

31:28.786 --> 31:30.344
He's mulling it over.

31:31.656 --> 31:33.351
We got the house!

31:33.524 --> 31:37.119
I was worried about the other offer,
but it fell through.

31:37.295 --> 31:40.594
It must be fate! I'm so happy!

31:46.437 --> 31:47.870
Should we stop?

31:48.039 --> 31:51.031
Why do you always do that?

31:52.277 --> 31:55.804
We get a nice mood going,
and then you ruin it.

31:55.980 --> 32:00.474
I think you have some intimacy
problems, John. I really do.

32:01.519 --> 32:02.645
What is that?

32:04.355 --> 32:08.314
John! John, come here!

32:09.360 --> 32:11.658
Is that Duff?

32:11.996 --> 32:13.896
Yeah, I guess it is.

32:15.533 --> 32:19.469
- You can't ring the doorbell?
- I didn't wanna wake up Elaine.

32:19.637 --> 32:22.231
That's why you were
revving your engine?

32:22.407 --> 32:25.672
Okay, well, I guess someone doesn't
want $30,000.

32:25.843 --> 32:28.004
- From where?
- I asked my uncle.

32:28.179 --> 32:31.046
Are you serious?
I don't know what to say.

32:31.249 --> 32:34.980
Don't worry about it. Hop in.
We gotta meet him in 15 minutes.

32:35.153 --> 32:37.018
- I see.
- What is he doing here?

32:37.188 --> 32:40.282
- Evening, ma'am.
- You wanna shut off M'Lady?

32:40.458 --> 32:45.794
You wanna shut it off for me?
Maybe you'd like to shut it off for me!

32:46.064 --> 32:49.625
Just, please.
Just sit tight a second. Okay?

32:50.802 --> 32:53.498
I thought you weren't
hanging out anymore.

32:53.671 --> 32:58.199
- Duff's grown up an awful lot.
- He's still an asshole.

32:58.376 --> 33:00.970
- Casserole.
- I said asshole.

33:01.145 --> 33:03.978
- I thought you said casserole.
- I said asshole.

33:04.148 --> 33:05.706
I heard casserole.

33:05.883 --> 33:09.842
I bumped into Duff, and when
he heard about the new house...

33:10.021 --> 33:14.185
...he was so thrilled, he offered
to do some free landscaping.

33:14.359 --> 33:16.987
- What are you...?
- Don't wait up, okay?

33:17.161 --> 33:20.392
- We may have to do soil tests...
- Got soil testing...

33:20.565 --> 33:22.396
- You're...
- Check the roots...

33:22.567 --> 33:24.364
- Checking the roots.
- Don't...

33:24.535 --> 33:26.799
- Irrigation.
- What are...?

33:44.222 --> 33:47.282
You're waking everybody up!

33:56.901 --> 33:59.392
You come here a lot, Jack?

33:59.570 --> 34:03.472
I don't think that's any of your
goddamn business.

34:04.475 --> 34:06.136
- Sorry.
- So here's the deal.

34:06.310 --> 34:10.076
The state lottery jackpot's
up to $86 million this week.

34:10.248 --> 34:12.580
I don't think the lottery's
gonna help.

34:12.750 --> 34:16.379
Shut up before I show this shoe
your anal cavity.

34:16.554 --> 34:19.614
I don't like this guy.
I got a feeling.

34:19.791 --> 34:23.283
He just wants to know what's
going on, okay, Uncle Jack?

34:27.498 --> 34:29.022
Not here.

34:30.001 --> 34:33.596
My uncle owns one of the biggest
liquor stores in the state.

34:33.838 --> 34:36.170
He's a very successful man.

34:36.340 --> 34:39.672
That's because I found
an opportunity and exploited it.

34:39.844 --> 34:43.143
That opportunity being alcoholics.

34:43.313 --> 34:47.842
And after all these years of work,
I wind up being a pimp for the state.

34:48.018 --> 34:50.248
- The lottery.
- The lottery.

34:50.420 --> 34:53.549
I have one of the biggest lottery
outlets in the state.

34:53.724 --> 34:56.284
Tomorrow alone we'll take
in over $ 70,000.

34:56.460 --> 35:01.694
You know what I get for that?
Pennies? It's an insult.

35:01.866 --> 35:03.561
So tell him the plan.

35:08.139 --> 35:09.538
Not here.

35:11.442 --> 35:15.879
I got so much lottery money,
I can't fit it in the cash register.

35:16.080 --> 35:20.107
I dump it into a cardboard box
under the ticket terminal.

35:20.318 --> 35:24.277
Can you imagine how easy
it would be to steal that money?

35:24.455 --> 35:28.516
- Wouldn't that be bad?
- That would be bad, hamster-dick...

35:28.726 --> 35:33.129
...unless I knew who was robbing me,
and we had a deal worked out.

35:33.397 --> 35:38.528
It's foolproof. We stick the place up,
we grab the money and we're done.

35:38.703 --> 35:42.332
- And you're gonna be there.
- No, I'm going to be in Reno...

35:42.540 --> 35:44.440
...so nobody smells anything.

35:44.609 --> 35:48.204
The kid behind the counter
weighs like 8 pounds.

35:48.412 --> 35:52.212
Is he gonna piss when he sees
what a big gun you have?

35:52.416 --> 35:56.477
- Gun? No. No way.
- We're not gonna use real guns, John.

35:56.687 --> 36:00.418
- We're not gonna use real guns.
- Just bring me the cash...

36:00.591 --> 36:03.185
...l'll give you 30,000
for your trouble.

36:03.394 --> 36:05.828
You in or out?

36:06.330 --> 36:09.925
- Can I think about it?
- While I think about cutting off...

36:10.101 --> 36:12.296
...your sack with a dull penknife.

36:13.838 --> 36:17.797
- Where did you get him?
- What are you doing, man?

36:20.111 --> 36:21.806
Excuse me.

36:25.149 --> 36:27.640
- Nice.
- We're going skiing.

36:29.453 --> 36:34.481
None of these guns look real. This one
is green. This one turns into a robot.

36:34.659 --> 36:37.457
Don't they have any
that look like real guns?

36:37.662 --> 36:42.395
- Maybe we should use slingshots.
- A slingshot is not a real weapon.

36:42.600 --> 36:46.161
- It's a toy.
- It's not a real weapon, is it, John?

36:46.337 --> 36:48.328
Define the word weapon for me...

36:48.539 --> 36:53.203
...while this baby smashes into
your temple at 180 miles per hour.

36:53.377 --> 36:56.175
- Hello?
- Hi.

36:57.448 --> 37:00.110
- Can I help you?
- We're looking for a gun...

37:00.284 --> 37:05.119
...that looks like a real gun.
Metal, possibly with some bolt action.

37:05.289 --> 37:07.883
We don't sell realistic weapons, sir.

37:08.092 --> 37:12.222
Our store's policy is to make
children's gunplay nonviolent.

37:12.396 --> 37:13.920
Do you sell spray paint?

37:15.533 --> 37:19.492
- Can I help you guys?
- No, no. We're cool.

37:28.813 --> 37:30.508
Look, John...

37:30.715 --> 37:33.684
...we got Mr. Tough Guy here.

37:33.884 --> 37:36.148
Are you ready?

37:36.320 --> 37:38.049
No?

37:41.993 --> 37:45.622
How about now, you bastards?

37:45.830 --> 37:48.890
You want a slice of this?

37:49.267 --> 37:54.261
How would you like a whole plateful
of this, you stupid bastards?

37:54.438 --> 37:55.666
What?

37:55.840 --> 37:59.037
You boys look nice.
Are you going to the dance?

37:59.243 --> 38:00.767
Mom...

38:00.978 --> 38:03.003
...get out of here!

38:06.417 --> 38:08.578
- You nervous?
- I guess.

38:08.786 --> 38:12.745
- You got your gun?
- Yeah, but the paint is a little sticky.

38:12.923 --> 38:15.357
- It looks good, though.
- Thanks.

38:15.559 --> 38:17.789
- Let's do this.
- Yeah.

38:21.399 --> 38:22.525
- John, wait.
- What?

38:22.700 --> 38:25.828
- We should make up some names.
- Why?

38:26.003 --> 38:28.801
Just in case we have to communicate
inside.

38:28.973 --> 38:33.535
I wanna be Kyle. I knew this guy,
his name was Kyle. He was maybe 13.

38:33.744 --> 38:37.009
He got two girls pregnant.
Two girls pregnant.

38:37.782 --> 38:41.240
- Yeah, Kyle. Who you gonna be?
- Steve.

38:41.419 --> 38:43.182
- Steve.
- Yeah.

38:43.354 --> 38:47.154
- Okay, Steve.
- Okay, Kyle.

38:47.325 --> 38:48.383
Wait.

38:48.559 --> 38:50.720
- What?
- Wait, I wanna be Steve.

38:50.895 --> 38:53.056
- I'm Steve. You're Carl.
- Kyle!

38:53.230 --> 38:55.892
- I just wanna go in there and do this!
- Kyle!

38:56.467 --> 38:58.094
Excuse me.

38:58.502 --> 39:00.231
All right, American cattle!

39:00.438 --> 39:04.602
Nobody does anything stupid
and you go home to your Tv dinners.

39:04.775 --> 39:08.233
- Put your hands in the air, sweetheart.
- Shit.

39:08.412 --> 39:10.380
- Get them up.
- Give us the money.

39:10.581 --> 39:12.481
- It's underneath.
- I'll get it.

39:12.650 --> 39:15.483
If he tries to be a hero,
you pop him, Kyle.

39:15.686 --> 39:19.281
- I hear you, Kyle.
- I'm Steve. I'm Steve.

39:19.457 --> 39:22.187
- He's Kyle!
- Give us the money!

39:22.360 --> 39:25.420
- Keep the hands up, schoolboy!
- Here.

39:25.629 --> 39:28.063
Yeah, come to Steve.

39:28.265 --> 39:32.224
All right, get on the floor
and count to 300.

39:32.403 --> 39:36.931
No skipping numbers or counting
in base 8 or anything like that.

39:37.108 --> 39:40.100
- One. Two...
- Look at this gun. This one's better.

39:40.711 --> 39:42.474
Not now. Let's go!

39:42.646 --> 39:45.615
I don't think so, punk-ass! Freeze!

39:45.783 --> 39:48.274
You move, I pop you like a pimple.

39:48.452 --> 39:51.012
Now put the box down.

39:51.589 --> 39:53.682
Now drop the guns.

39:55.226 --> 39:56.955
Drop it!

39:57.161 --> 40:01.894
- I'm trying. The paint, it's stuck.
- Fucking get with it, John.

40:02.066 --> 40:04.728
Steve. My name is Steve!

40:04.902 --> 40:06.733
Drop it!

40:08.773 --> 40:10.968
Go! Go! Go!

40:43.874 --> 40:46.934
- We almost died.
- I've never been shot at before.

40:47.144 --> 40:50.910
There was one other time,
but I didn't know till after.

40:51.081 --> 40:53.811
I told you it was a bad idea.
I told you!

40:53.984 --> 40:55.815
- Know your problem?
- Get out!

40:55.986 --> 40:58.682
You can't thank people
for trying to help.

40:58.856 --> 41:00.983
Help me get my ass shot off?

41:01.192 --> 41:05.561
I give up. I failed Noreen, and I don't
care. I wanna get back to my life.

41:05.763 --> 41:10.029
I've been thinking of this scam
that involves pizza delivery.

41:12.303 --> 41:15.170
You were never Steve!

41:16.907 --> 41:22.243
One of these guys was about 6 foot.
What about the other guy?

41:22.413 --> 41:24.278
The same, only heavier.

41:24.482 --> 41:29.442
- And you said his name was...?
- John or Kyle...

41:30.187 --> 41:31.176
...or Steve.

41:31.355 --> 41:35.815
- And the other guy's name was...?
- Kyle or John or Steve.

41:35.993 --> 41:38.393
- Do you have a permit?
- Yes, sir.

41:38.562 --> 41:43.022
- How many times did you fire it?
- Just once. I shot out the window.

41:43.234 --> 41:46.135
I didn't shoot out the sign.
They did that.

41:46.337 --> 41:48.601
They shot the sign, not me.

41:48.806 --> 41:53.402
And then they doubled back
and stole the surveillance tapes.

41:53.611 --> 41:57.547
They were crazy. They were crazy.
They were crazy.

41:59.216 --> 42:02.242
Anything else you'd like
to tell me right now?

42:02.419 --> 42:04.410
I don't know if this would help...

42:04.588 --> 42:07.557
...I remember four digits
on the license plate.

42:07.725 --> 42:10.694
No. I don't think that
would help at all.

42:10.861 --> 42:15.025
What are you, a complete numskull?
Give me the numbers.

42:25.709 --> 42:29.304
Yeah, I can't believe I got in!

42:31.682 --> 42:33.547
- Patty?
- Who is it?

42:33.751 --> 42:37.710
- It's John.
- Hold on!

42:41.091 --> 42:44.117
- How's it going?
- Hi.

42:48.132 --> 42:52.398
The doorbell gave out this morning,
and they couldn't fix it.

42:52.570 --> 42:56.631
- A little late for an electrician.
- I don't like your tone.

42:56.807 --> 42:59.776
You got something to say,
why don't you say it?

42:59.944 --> 43:01.309
Hey.

43:06.951 --> 43:10.546
I know I've always been
too wild for your tastes...

43:10.754 --> 43:14.588
...but what can I tell you?
I've got an independent spirit.

43:14.758 --> 43:18.091
And a thing for
the Electricians Local 214.

43:18.295 --> 43:20.661
Why are you so mean?
Give me a break.

43:20.831 --> 43:25.097
Patty, I'm sorry! I'm having
a really rough time right now.

43:25.302 --> 43:27.964
I'm having trouble
getting it together.

43:28.172 --> 43:30.072
John...

43:35.112 --> 43:38.081
Do you remember
Mom and Dad's funeral?

43:38.282 --> 43:41.080
- And that suit you wore?
- The brown one.

43:41.285 --> 43:45.688
You couldn't tie your tie, and you
asked me to do it, but I couldn't.

43:46.023 --> 43:51.393
- It was no big deal. The priest did it.
- But that is a big deal, John.

43:52.029 --> 43:57.365
Because I'm your older sister, and
I couldn't even tie your goddamn tie.

43:58.469 --> 44:02.997
I mean, look, I know I'm not
gonna win the Best Sister prize...

44:03.907 --> 44:05.306
...but...

44:06.910 --> 44:09.378
God, John...

44:09.813 --> 44:13.806
...what you are doing for Noreen...

44:14.018 --> 44:19.217
...is so generous and so good.

44:20.424 --> 44:23.257
It's nice to know after all this time...

44:23.427 --> 44:27.591
...I have a little brother
who maybe sort of loves me.

44:28.165 --> 44:30.759
You know I love you.

44:30.934 --> 44:33.061
You're my family.

44:46.450 --> 44:48.441
Uncle John! What a surprise!

44:48.652 --> 44:53.589
This is my uncle. If it wasn't for him,
none of this would be possible.

45:21.118 --> 45:24.610
Pull the vehicle forward.
A little more. A little more.

45:25.155 --> 45:28.147
Ricky, swing to the branch.
Swing your body.

45:28.325 --> 45:31.624
Pretend you're a little monkey,
but you have a saw...

45:31.795 --> 45:34.286
...and you're pruning.
You're a monkey.

45:34.465 --> 45:37.901
Good. Yeah, no... On the branch.
Prune, Ricky, prune.

45:38.068 --> 45:42.368
Swing it, swing on the branch.
On the branch, Ricky!

45:42.573 --> 45:47.010
Hey, how did she take the news?
Did she start to cry?

45:47.177 --> 45:49.407
Did she shake?
She didn't wobble?

45:49.580 --> 45:54.608
I didn't tell her, Duff, and I'm not
going to. Noreen is going to Harvard.

45:54.785 --> 45:57.913
Because I am going to see Loach.

45:58.188 --> 45:59.621
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

45:59.957 --> 46:02.858
And you're coming with me. Right now.

46:08.098 --> 46:10.760
Okay, that's an act of God.

46:11.568 --> 46:13.263
Hang in there, Ricky.

46:13.604 --> 46:19.167
Yes, I understand it was a funeral.
I guess I goofed up.

46:19.977 --> 46:24.641
I can see how a happy happy-birthday
basket...

46:24.815 --> 46:30.685
...might seem ironic and cruel,
but it was an honest mistake.

46:34.091 --> 46:40.428
It's not that easy running a small-sized
business out of a house...

46:40.597 --> 46:42.963
...especially this house!

46:43.133 --> 46:48.935
I'm sorry he's dead, but things
haven't been great around here either.

46:49.106 --> 46:51.973
Can I put you on hold?

47:01.885 --> 47:04.012
- Hello.
- Daddy?

47:04.188 --> 47:06.019
Is it okay if I come over?

47:14.598 --> 47:17.260
- What do you want?
- Hey, is Loach here?

47:17.634 --> 47:23.402
Lift high and lower. Point the toes.
Flatten abdominals.

47:31.982 --> 47:34.951
Hey, guys. We're old
friends of Dave's.

47:35.152 --> 47:37.052
We went to school with him.

47:37.221 --> 47:40.156
Yeah, school. I'm sure
you've heard of school.

47:40.324 --> 47:44.761
You probably went there for a couple
of days while you were little.

47:45.863 --> 47:48.525
I'm just kidding.
Trying to break the ice.

47:48.699 --> 47:51.133
Why is anybody talking?

47:51.869 --> 47:53.928
Hey, Dave.

47:54.304 --> 47:58.604
John Plummer. Remember?
You used to call me asshole?

47:58.775 --> 48:02.302
- I call everybody asshole.
- I believe I was the first.

48:02.646 --> 48:07.208
- We were 5, maybe 6, at the time.
- Congratulations, asshole.

48:07.384 --> 48:09.011
Now get to the point.

48:09.186 --> 48:11.984
I might need a partner
for some heavy stuff.

48:12.155 --> 48:13.622
How heavy?

48:13.790 --> 48:18.386
Well, let's just say it's a little
too heavy to lift alone.

48:22.032 --> 48:24.125
Okay, so talk.

48:27.771 --> 48:29.102
Not here.

48:36.146 --> 48:41.743
Okay, just so we're all on the same
page, I'm flying right now. Angel dust.

48:41.919 --> 48:47.152
So let's keep it real, boys. Keep it
real, and nobody is getting hurt.

48:50.594 --> 48:54.496
I could smell your foot.
I could smell your foot on that one.

48:55.065 --> 48:58.432
He's been acting strange.
He's been out three nights.

48:58.602 --> 49:03.130
The first night he came home,
he went and took a shower.

49:03.307 --> 49:06.538
- That's not good.
- He's having an affair, isn't he?

49:06.710 --> 49:11.443
Now, sweetheart, let's not rush
to judgment. But yes.

49:11.615 --> 49:14.448
Your shitty boyfriend
is having an affair...

49:14.618 --> 49:17.485
...and we might have some
information about that.

49:17.654 --> 49:19.349
Tell me. Tell me.

49:19.523 --> 49:23.391
No. I don't want to upset you
until it's absolutely certain...

49:23.560 --> 49:26.427
...that I can upset you.
Let me do some snooping...

49:26.596 --> 49:30.555
...and then we'll respond
swiftly and without mercy.

49:31.301 --> 49:33.826
What happened?
Did he give you the money?

49:34.004 --> 49:39.032
He said he'd get it for me tomorrow,
Duff. It couldn't have been easier.

49:39.209 --> 49:42.542
I don't know how this is gonna
go down, sweetheart.

49:42.713 --> 49:47.377
- Things could get a little crazy.
- I don't want you getting hurt.

49:47.684 --> 49:52.815
Kitten, I gave the vC 18 months to
hurt me, and I walked away laughing.

49:52.990 --> 49:55.390
- Don't worry about me.
- I'm coming.

49:55.559 --> 49:58.084
No, you're not.
This doesn't concern you.

49:58.261 --> 50:00.559
Doesn't concern me? It's my life.

50:00.731 --> 50:04.189
You made a heck of a job out of it.
This guy is a lump.

50:04.368 --> 50:08.998
I don't want you wasting more time.
Who is gonna support you?

50:09.473 --> 50:14.001
I can support myself. Once my basket
business turns the corner, I...

50:14.177 --> 50:19.740
Putting bows on faggy little olives
and water biscuits is not a job.

50:19.916 --> 50:23.079
It's a nice hobby,
but it will never pay the bills.

50:23.720 --> 50:27.121
It's always money with you.

50:27.891 --> 50:31.657
Sometimes I think you care more
about money than you do me.

50:31.828 --> 50:35.229
Kitten, honey, innocent...

50:35.399 --> 50:38.698
I don't want you getting
all emotional about this.

50:38.869 --> 50:40.393
Yeah.

50:49.546 --> 50:52.674
Hello? Is anyone home?

50:54.785 --> 50:56.650
Hello?

51:01.324 --> 51:03.918
Well, well. What have we here?

51:09.733 --> 51:14.898
What kind of car did we have
when we first got married?

51:15.072 --> 51:18.166
- I think it was an El Dorado.
- Yes.

51:18.341 --> 51:22.801
It was an El Dorado, wasn't it? Turn.

51:29.586 --> 51:35.081
I'm not a homosexual, you understand.
I just... I miss my wife very much.

51:36.026 --> 51:40.793
- I lost my wife three years ago.
- You know what I'm going through.

51:41.465 --> 51:46.095
Well, not to this extent, per se,
but I have a rough idea.

51:47.904 --> 51:50.668
You can go ahead
and put your clothes on.

51:51.074 --> 51:56.376
Can I have some privacy? I feel funny
getting dressed around other men.

52:13.797 --> 52:16.425
What the hell?

52:17.567 --> 52:20.730
I'm here investigating
a holdup of a liquor store...

52:20.904 --> 52:24.203
...that occurred a short time ago
on Fourth Street.

52:24.374 --> 52:28.538
- I don't know anything about that.
- That's odd. Here's why.

52:28.845 --> 52:32.975
The license plate on your car matches
the license plate of the car...

52:33.150 --> 52:36.210
...used during the robbery.
- That's not possible.

52:36.386 --> 52:39.549
- It was with me the whole night.
- Where were you?

52:39.723 --> 52:41.987
With... My friend.

52:42.159 --> 52:44.753
- Having a couple beers.
- Where?

52:45.328 --> 52:50.732
I just don't really remember, because
I was, you know, a little messed up.

52:50.901 --> 52:53.631
- You drove drunk?
- I'm sorry?

52:53.803 --> 52:58.103
You were in the car and you were
drunk, so you drove drunk.

52:58.608 --> 53:00.576
Not that I can recall.

53:01.545 --> 53:06.414
- What was your friend's name?
- Walter Duffy. Duff.

53:06.583 --> 53:11.282
And this Duff will say that you were
with him at the time of the robbery?

53:11.454 --> 53:15.390
Yeah, he will. V ery much so. Yeah.

53:17.060 --> 53:20.621
- You seem a little shaky, Plummer.
- Yeah.

53:21.965 --> 53:26.800
- The booze. It's a bad scene.
- It sure as hell is.

53:27.270 --> 53:30.000
You told him you were with me.
Gave my name.

53:30.173 --> 53:34.701
- You want me to lie to a cop?
- Yes! Yes, I do!

53:35.312 --> 53:37.610
- Where is Loach?
- He'll be here.

53:37.781 --> 53:43.720
He told us to park in this lot at 3:00
and to wait until he showed up.

53:43.887 --> 53:46.913
Well, it's 10 after.
He's not gonna show.

53:47.090 --> 53:51.891
Yes, he will. This is a plan that,
unlike your plans, will succeed.

53:52.062 --> 53:53.620
And do you know why?

53:53.797 --> 53:56.789
Because I did a little creative
visualization...

53:56.967 --> 53:59.663
...and I saw it succeeding
in my mind's eye.

53:59.869 --> 54:03.202
Everybody, hands in the air!
Money in the bag!

54:03.373 --> 54:06.103
Facedown! Money in the bag!

54:06.276 --> 54:07.971
I'll shoot you in the ass!

54:08.144 --> 54:09.406
He's not gonna show.

54:09.579 --> 54:11.342
- Yes, he will.
- Let's go!

54:13.216 --> 54:17.152
- Let's hit it! Start the car, asshole.
- I told you he'd show up.

54:17.420 --> 54:21.186
- Drive! Hit it! Hit it!
- They robbed a bank!

54:21.391 --> 54:24.417
- Wait, where's my money?
- Drive or die!

54:24.594 --> 54:28.155
Jesus, John, just drive.
They got a gun at your head.

54:28.331 --> 54:31.129
I'm not going anywhere
until I get my 30,000.

54:31.334 --> 54:34.792
- Get these guys out of the car!
- I want my money!

54:35.005 --> 54:37.473
- You are dead!
- Go away!

54:37.674 --> 54:41.303
- You are so dead! You're dead!
- I want my money!

54:41.511 --> 54:45.379
We're dead. Go! Go!
We are so dead! We are so dead!

54:46.182 --> 54:50.482
Get back here, you asshole!
You asshole!

54:54.157 --> 54:58.389
I hit David Loach in the head.
I hit him! It felt good, Duff.

54:58.595 --> 55:02.793
That's super. Nice plan, by the way.
Guess I couldn't visualize it...

55:02.966 --> 55:06.367
...because there was a gun pointed
at my mind's eye.

55:06.536 --> 55:08.902
- See you later.
- Where are you going?

55:09.072 --> 55:13.668
I'm certainly not gonna stick around
anywhere near the getaway car!

55:13.843 --> 55:18.405
- I'm just supposed to leave my car?
- Know what your problem is, John?

55:18.581 --> 55:22.950
- Not knowing when to cut your losses.
- You think that's my problem?

55:23.119 --> 55:26.577
That's not my problem.
Wanna know what my problem is?

55:26.756 --> 55:29.156
You. Are. The. Problem!

55:29.359 --> 55:32.590
You! You! You!

56:30.253 --> 56:32.414
It's a two-way mirror, Duff.

56:56.713 --> 56:59.546
I turned 40 last week.

57:00.216 --> 57:02.411
Do you know what I did?

57:02.952 --> 57:07.013
Got my colon scoped by Dr. Spencer.
Do you know what he told me?

57:07.223 --> 57:13.219
"You have one of the cleanest rectums
I've ever seen." And do you know why?

57:13.396 --> 57:16.957
During my quiet time here at work,
I use a toothbrush...

57:17.133 --> 57:21.627
...I have here in my desk to get
to the really hard-to-find spots.

57:21.805 --> 57:24.433
Just for a really good scrubbing.

57:29.446 --> 57:32.882
- You think you're so smart, don't you?
- No.

57:34.184 --> 57:38.018
The way you made those
surveillance tapes just disappear...

57:38.221 --> 57:42.521
...just got rid of them somehow.
- What tapes?

57:42.725 --> 57:45.558
- Will you do me a personal favor, son?
- Sure.

57:45.762 --> 57:51.132
Don't ever play me like a flute. Okay?

57:51.301 --> 57:56.068
You two idiots got real lucky.
I don't have enough to keep you here.

57:56.306 --> 57:59.798
But mark my words, gentlemen.
You're going down.

58:00.009 --> 58:05.709
I mean, you're either going down
or, by God, I'm gonna take you down.

58:05.882 --> 58:09.409
But either way, once you're down...

58:11.721 --> 58:14.212
You'll stay down! You'll stay down!

58:14.424 --> 58:17.416
You will stay down!

58:18.094 --> 58:19.561
Now get up and get out!

58:19.762 --> 58:23.858
Get up, get out! Get up, get out!

58:24.067 --> 58:28.595
Get up and go! Get up and go!
Don't touch my door!

58:41.184 --> 58:42.674
Hello.

58:44.354 --> 58:46.584
I know you're wondering
where I've been...

58:46.789 --> 58:50.452
...and I know I've been distracted
and weird, but I promise you...

58:50.660 --> 58:55.063
...everything's gonna get back
to normal. I love you and...

58:58.334 --> 59:01.792
- I'll get that. Don't worry about it.
- You lying bastard!

59:01.971 --> 59:05.998
- What did I do?
- You pretended to be decent...

59:06.175 --> 59:10.703
...and now I find out
you're a sick, twisted pervert!

59:11.147 --> 59:13.775
What? Where did you get this?

59:13.983 --> 59:16.451
From Daddy. You're a drag queen!

59:16.653 --> 59:19.816
You are a cross-dressing
transvestite freak!

59:19.989 --> 59:23.652
- And you lied to me.
- I did, but let me tell you why.

59:24.060 --> 59:26.893
Noreen got into Harvard,
she needed $30,000...

59:27.096 --> 59:30.395
...I promised to pay for it.
I tried to steal the money...

59:30.567 --> 59:35.300
...from this guy, but I ended up in
a wig and a dress spooning with him.

59:35.505 --> 59:38.338
- Spooning?
- Yes!

59:38.641 --> 59:43.305
Then I went into a liquor store with a
gun and almost got my ass shot off!

59:43.780 --> 59:49.116
And today I came this close to driving
the getaway car for a bank robbery.

59:49.319 --> 59:53.653
And I hit David Loach in the face with
that steering-wheel Club you gave me.

59:53.856 --> 59:57.019
- Crazy David from school?
- Plus there's your father.

59:57.226 --> 01:00:00.457
- What did you do to him?
- Nothing. That's the problem.

01:00:00.630 --> 01:00:04.031
He's always watching me.
And when I come home...

01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:06.498
...he's here to take you on dates!
- What dates?

01:00:06.703 --> 01:00:11.606
Where he squires you around. You go
to bed smelling like English Leather...

01:00:11.774 --> 01:00:14.436
...and I have freaky dreams
about England.

01:00:14.711 --> 01:00:18.147
Why didn't you come to me
in the first place?

01:00:19.816 --> 01:00:23.343
Why was the hardest thing
to tell me the truth?

01:00:24.087 --> 01:00:27.488
Of all the things I've done
these past few days...

01:00:27.657 --> 01:00:32.185
...the one thing I couldn't do
was disappoint you.

01:00:34.831 --> 01:00:37.231
Do you like my baskets?

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:38.799
Yeah.

01:00:39.002 --> 01:00:43.962
- You don't think they're just a hobby?
- No, they're amazing!

01:00:46.943 --> 01:00:48.911
John.

01:00:58.755 --> 01:01:01.019
I know where we can get $30,000.

01:01:01.190 --> 01:01:03.181
- Where?
- From my dad.

01:01:03.393 --> 01:01:05.691
We're not borrowing
from your father.

01:01:05.895 --> 01:01:09.991
- I know. We're gonna take it from him.
- Take as in "steal"?

01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:16.094
When he was drunk, he told me he
keeps about $50,000 in cash at work.

01:01:16.272 --> 01:01:19.503
- At Homespital?
- Yep. It's just sitting there.

01:01:19.676 --> 01:01:21.041
Waiting for us.

01:01:21.210 --> 01:01:23.337
This is gonna be easy.

01:01:23.513 --> 01:01:25.743
- And fun.
- I don't know, Elaine.

01:01:25.915 --> 01:01:30.443
- Stealing from your father?
- What? He's got insurance.

01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:34.181
- We're really just stealing from them.
- Bastards.

01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:36.449
Yeah.

01:01:37.493 --> 01:01:42.430
So tell me again about how you hit
David Loach in the face.

01:01:43.433 --> 01:01:47.927
Well, let's just put it this way.
His ass was kicked.

01:01:48.504 --> 01:01:51.268
You are so sexy right now.

01:01:56.479 --> 01:01:59.937
- You're not crying.
- Why would I be crying?

01:02:04.287 --> 01:02:06.983
She couldn't spell "tarp"?

01:02:11.894 --> 01:02:13.555
Wait.

01:02:14.263 --> 01:02:16.925
I have a confession to make.

01:02:18.367 --> 01:02:19.664
What?

01:02:19.836 --> 01:02:21.804
I never saw the house.

01:02:22.271 --> 01:02:24.296
- Isn't it cute?
- Yeah.

01:02:24.474 --> 01:02:25.600
I love it.

01:02:33.549 --> 01:02:36.143
I love that kitchen.

01:02:40.623 --> 01:02:43.319
Elaine said we needed
a third person...

01:02:43.693 --> 01:02:46.992
...and there was only one place
we could go.

01:02:47.163 --> 01:02:48.630
We had to go to Duff.

01:02:55.438 --> 01:02:58.874
- What's this?
- It's Gruyere cheese. It's good.

01:02:59.041 --> 01:03:02.135
Really? Is it good?

01:03:02.311 --> 01:03:05.144
Is it mild and nutty,
yet piquant in flavor?

01:03:05.314 --> 01:03:08.613
Named after the Gruyeres district
in Switzerland?

01:03:08.785 --> 01:03:12.915
I happen to know what Gruyeres is,
Elaine. I've been to Gruyeres.

01:03:16.058 --> 01:03:17.855
Gruyere is in France.

01:03:18.461 --> 01:03:21.055
- Whatever, Elaine.
- So will you help us?

01:03:22.532 --> 01:03:24.830
Mom! Privacy!

01:03:25.201 --> 01:03:29.228
- You hit my head on the car.
- I was frustrated. I'm sorry, Duff.

01:03:29.405 --> 01:03:33.136
- I have to wear a Band-Aid.
- Are you gonna help us or not?

01:03:35.745 --> 01:03:38.578
I can't stay mad at you, man.

01:03:39.248 --> 01:03:43.514
We have to promise to not say any
more mean things about each other.

01:03:43.686 --> 01:03:46.849
- I have never said anything mean.
- You're a lying bitch.

01:03:47.056 --> 01:03:49.251
- You're a bag of crap.
- You are.

01:03:49.458 --> 01:03:51.619
- You're such a loser!
- Skank!

01:03:51.794 --> 01:03:55.252
Okay, super! So we're all on board.

01:04:04.774 --> 01:04:07.242
Well, hello.

01:04:16.586 --> 01:04:19.555
- Everybody ready?
- How about you, Anton?

01:04:19.722 --> 01:04:21.212
- Yeah.
- Griselda?

01:04:21.390 --> 01:04:22.618
I'm ready, Steve.

01:04:22.792 --> 01:04:25.556
- It's Stan.
- I thought you liked Steve.

01:04:25.728 --> 01:04:30.995
You saw what happened to Steve.
Screw Steve. I hate Steve.

01:04:34.570 --> 01:04:36.629
Let's do this.

01:04:39.809 --> 01:04:42.437
Okay. Come on, come on.

01:04:42.612 --> 01:04:44.910
Go. Go. Go.

01:04:52.388 --> 01:04:54.288
Duff, what is that?

01:04:55.491 --> 01:04:57.550
Do you know what you're doing?

01:04:57.727 --> 01:05:01.219
I'd like to think the answer
to that is obvious.

01:05:08.738 --> 01:05:10.706
Over here.

01:05:18.014 --> 01:05:20.107
Cleaners.

01:05:22.885 --> 01:05:24.910
They're leaving.

01:05:48.978 --> 01:05:53.506
We've got a little surprise for you.
Don't we, Rex?

01:06:05.895 --> 01:06:07.863
Duff, is that Silly Putty?

01:06:08.097 --> 01:06:11.123
In a manner of speaking, yes, it is.

01:06:12.468 --> 01:06:15.301
You guys, it's open.

01:06:25.314 --> 01:06:28.249
- Wow, he really likes you.
- Rex!

01:06:29.986 --> 01:06:33.478
My little girl with those two lumps...

01:06:40.029 --> 01:06:42.361
There you go.

01:06:43.399 --> 01:06:45.458
He said there was money in here.

01:06:45.634 --> 01:06:49.764
Let's look in his office. Smash a
window, make it look like a break-in.

01:06:49.939 --> 01:06:53.238
Smash a window?
Think I'm a little busy here, guys.

01:06:54.076 --> 01:06:57.944
Think he might have caught a whiff
of my... Gruyeres cheese.

01:07:00.249 --> 01:07:04.515
I can't find it. And there's not
one single picture of me in here.

01:07:04.687 --> 01:07:06.450
- I bet it's in there.
- What?

01:07:06.622 --> 01:07:08.613
Organ Man.

01:07:15.498 --> 01:07:18.467
Snack time. Go get the hand.

01:07:52.034 --> 01:07:54.002
It's here. All right, let's go.

01:07:54.170 --> 01:07:55.432
- Hold it.
- What is it?

01:07:55.771 --> 01:08:00.504
You. In command. Taking control.

01:08:00.709 --> 01:08:04.543
You're very sexy right now.
I wanna do it right here.

01:08:04.713 --> 01:08:07.910
- What?
- Right on my dad's desk.

01:08:31.774 --> 01:08:34.937
Here we go. Okay.

01:09:21.624 --> 01:09:23.386
Okay. Okay.

01:09:30.899 --> 01:09:33.663
Joe. Homespital.

01:09:34.502 --> 01:09:38.234
Detective Charles.
Backup, immediately.

01:09:38.439 --> 01:09:41.408
No! Just get away! Get away!

01:09:46.549 --> 01:09:50.417
Asshole! Think you could just
leave me there?

01:09:52.421 --> 01:09:53.410
Loach?

01:09:53.622 --> 01:09:56.113
Cheap-shot me, then leave me
to get pinched?

01:09:56.525 --> 01:10:00.552
I know we sort of got our signals
crossed back at the bank...

01:10:00.729 --> 01:10:03.857
...but I've got $50,000 here,
and I only need 30.

01:10:04.033 --> 01:10:10.097
Well, well, well. If it isn't big, bad
David Loach. Nice nose.

01:10:10.406 --> 01:10:14.035
Why don't you go back in the closet?
I can handle this.

01:10:14.210 --> 01:10:17.543
Did you enjoy getting the crap kicked
out of you?

01:10:17.746 --> 01:10:21.273
You back for seconds, little man?

01:10:21.450 --> 01:10:22.974
Daddy!

01:10:23.185 --> 01:10:26.951
- Thank you, Mr. Warner.
- Don't thank me, I thought it was you.

01:10:27.122 --> 01:10:30.057
Come over here and stand
where he was standing.

01:10:30.259 --> 01:10:32.022
Well, you piece of shit.

01:10:32.194 --> 01:10:34.822
- Wanna explain what's going on?
- Well...

01:10:34.997 --> 01:10:38.433
Shut your cakehole and let's get it on.
Let's go, boy.

01:10:38.601 --> 01:10:41.434
In all fairness, I'm younger
and in better shape.

01:10:42.037 --> 01:10:44.801
- I don't wanna hear from you.
- Okay, stop it.

01:10:45.541 --> 01:10:49.170
Well, Mr. Warner,
you're gonna hear from me. A lot.

01:10:49.378 --> 01:10:52.905
Know how I told you I never
had sex with your daughter?

01:10:53.115 --> 01:10:55.709
Well, I wasn't being entirely truthful.

01:10:55.884 --> 01:10:58.910
We did it the first night we met.
And ever since...

01:10:59.121 --> 01:11:03.455
...we've been banging together like a
pair of cymbals in a marching band.

01:11:03.726 --> 01:11:06.456
- So get used to it.
- I'll get used to it.

01:11:06.629 --> 01:11:10.497
As soon as you get used to walking
around with your balls...

01:11:10.699 --> 01:11:12.599
...in a fanny pack!

01:11:22.077 --> 01:11:24.045
Come on!

01:11:30.352 --> 01:11:32.547
I urge you to drop it!

01:11:36.859 --> 01:11:38.622
John, wait! Stop!

01:11:39.128 --> 01:11:41.756
- Duff, get in!
- Stop! Stop!

01:11:41.930 --> 01:11:45.331
Okay, go! Go! Go! Go! John, go!
Dog, stop!

01:11:45.534 --> 01:11:47.900
Duff, where were you?

01:11:48.103 --> 01:11:51.300
- Drop the weapon. Put it down!
- But they're stealing...

01:11:51.473 --> 01:11:54.374
- They're stealing from my man.
- Calm down.

01:11:54.543 --> 01:11:57.034
- From my man.
- Citizen, calm down.

01:11:57.212 --> 01:11:59.476
They were gonna have sex
on my desk.

01:11:59.682 --> 01:12:03.083
Listen to me. These won't hurt a bit.

01:12:03.285 --> 01:12:05.549
- Drive!
- I'm trying! I'm going!

01:12:07.389 --> 01:12:10.381
- We've got to get rid of the dog.
- Screw the dog.

01:12:10.559 --> 01:12:12.254
No! Stop the dog!

01:12:15.998 --> 01:12:17.397
Oh, my God!

01:12:29.945 --> 01:12:31.936
Daddy!

01:12:33.349 --> 01:12:36.113
- I'm fine.
- I'm sorry. You were mean to me.

01:12:36.285 --> 01:12:38.014
I'm fine. I'm fine, really.

01:12:39.722 --> 01:12:42.282
It's a good thing you're here, officer.

01:12:42.458 --> 01:12:45.188
Because a crime
has just been committed.

01:12:45.627 --> 01:12:47.424
Put the dog down.

01:12:48.263 --> 01:12:49.423
Number four.

01:12:49.598 --> 01:12:52.567
"Oh, yeah. Come to Steve."

01:12:52.735 --> 01:12:55.329
Now number three.

01:12:55.504 --> 01:12:58.871
"Oh, yeah. Come to Steve."

01:12:59.041 --> 01:13:02.477
That's him. The guy in the middle
and the guy next to him.

01:13:02.644 --> 01:13:06.944
They robbed the liquor store,
shot the sign, stole the porno mags...

01:13:07.116 --> 01:13:10.449
...and the chocolate milk...
Jeez, they're guilty, man.

01:13:10.652 --> 01:13:15.180
Might as well tell me everything.
We got your buddy, your girlfriend...

01:13:15.357 --> 01:13:17.655
You know one of them's
gonna spill.

01:13:17.826 --> 01:13:20.192
I don't think so. Elaine won't talk.

01:13:20.362 --> 01:13:22.728
She's my fiancée. We have a bond.

01:13:22.898 --> 01:13:25.128
Fair enough. What about Mr. Duffy?

01:13:25.300 --> 01:13:29.760
- Duff's my oldest friend in the world.
- Why are you pointing fingers at me?

01:13:29.938 --> 01:13:32.998
He did it. He planned it.
He's the mastermind.

01:13:33.175 --> 01:13:37.236
Give me a pen. I'll sign a blank piece
of paper. You can fill it out.

01:13:37.446 --> 01:13:41.177
This is not good.
Breaking and entering.

01:13:41.350 --> 01:13:45.446
Animal cruelty.
Attempted vehicular manslaughter.

01:13:45.654 --> 01:13:49.283
This is bad.
This is really, really bad.

01:13:54.196 --> 01:13:56.892
Okay, look. You are so going to jail.

01:13:57.065 --> 01:14:00.432
The best idea is to plead
insanity. What do you say?

01:14:00.602 --> 01:14:03.799
All rise.
Court is officially in session.

01:14:04.106 --> 01:14:08.736
The Honorable Emmett Cook
presiding. Please be seated.

01:14:09.378 --> 01:14:12.541
Good morning, everyone.
Shall we begin?

01:14:20.856 --> 01:14:22.221
Remember me?

01:14:33.368 --> 01:14:36.064
I have the picture.

01:14:40.542 --> 01:14:44.069
I can... You know, I don't...
I see no cause.

01:14:44.246 --> 01:14:48.410
So... Charges are dismissed.

01:14:48.784 --> 01:14:51.753
- Justice!
- I won a case.

01:15:18.514 --> 01:15:21.381
- What are you doing here?
- I had to talk, John.

01:15:21.750 --> 01:15:24.514
Look at me.
I can't go to prison.

01:15:24.686 --> 01:15:29.555
I wouldn't last a day in there. They'd
pass me around like a bag of Oreos.

01:15:30.692 --> 01:15:32.182
I'm sorry, man.

01:15:36.598 --> 01:15:38.532
I mean it.

01:15:41.136 --> 01:15:44.902
This is $ 1000, Duff.
What am I supposed to do with this?

01:15:48.610 --> 01:15:51.875
- You know what your problem is?
- What?

01:15:52.347 --> 01:15:54.008
You're too good a friend.

01:16:03.425 --> 01:16:04.414
John?

01:16:07.863 --> 01:16:12.766
People always talk about fate.
I never used to believe in all that.

01:16:12.935 --> 01:16:17.065
I'd always hoped we were masters
of our own destiny.

01:16:17.506 --> 01:16:20.998
And my destiny had become a bet
on a horse named M'Lady.

01:16:23.111 --> 01:16:25.841
That, believe it or not,
was a 30-to- 1 shot.

01:16:26.248 --> 01:16:29.115
I had tried a lot of ways
to get the money...

01:16:29.284 --> 01:16:33.516
...and all it ever got me was punched,
shot at and arrested.

01:16:33.689 --> 01:16:35.657
- And they're off!
- So here I was...

01:16:35.857 --> 01:16:39.623
...pinning Noreen's hopes
for education on an animal that...

01:16:39.828 --> 01:16:42.661
...couldn't win if it was
shot out of a cannon.

01:16:42.831 --> 01:16:46.358
And trailing is number 5, M'Lady.

01:16:48.437 --> 01:16:52.771
Making his move from behind,
the long shot, number 5, M'Lady.

01:16:52.975 --> 01:16:56.172
But for some reason, that day...

01:16:56.878 --> 01:16:59.904
...my horse ran the race of his life.

01:17:00.816 --> 01:17:04.843
As we enter the stretch, number 4,
Dance in the Dark, is fading.

01:17:05.153 --> 01:17:06.848
It's a two-horse race.

01:17:07.022 --> 01:17:11.220
So was that fate? I don't know.
But I do know this:

01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:17.089
If you show up, do your best and
spoon with the occasional judge...

01:17:17.265 --> 01:17:19.529
...you don't have to believe
in fate.

01:17:19.701 --> 01:17:26.004
- And it's M'Lady by a nose!
- Because fate will believe in you.

01:17:28.010 --> 01:17:32.879
Things worked out.
Elaine and I got married.

01:17:34.249 --> 01:17:37.013
Noreen couldn't be there.
She was at college.

01:17:37.219 --> 01:17:40.552
So Patty was the maid of honor.

01:17:40.722 --> 01:17:43.987
And there on the steps
of our charming starter home...

01:17:44.159 --> 01:17:47.253
...surrounded by our special friends...

01:17:47.429 --> 01:17:52.992
...it felt like we were finally
starting to live our dream.

01:17:53.635 --> 01:17:58.231
The only thing I didn't figure out
was how Duff got that $ 1000.

01:17:58.407 --> 01:18:01.968
Well, well. What have we here?

01:22:03.184 --> 01:22:04.549
Okay.

01:22:05.754 --> 01:22:07.278
Wait. Let me shut it.

01:22:07.589 --> 01:22:10.820
I know exactly
what you're talking about.

01:22:13.428 --> 01:22:15.487
I just salivated on you, I'm sorry.

01:22:15.664 --> 01:22:19.430
Saliva shot onto your body.

01:22:20.869 --> 01:22:22.496
So do I get paid...?

01:22:24.606 --> 01:22:25.595
- Let's go.
- Hold it.

01:22:25.774 --> 01:22:28.470
What... is it?

01:22:29.844 --> 01:22:33.336
Suddenly I'm William Shatner.
Let me do this again.

01:22:39.521 --> 01:22:41.580
- What is it?
- You.

01:22:43.458 --> 01:22:46.359
Wait. Sorry. Go back. Wait. Okay.

01:22:52.867 --> 01:22:54.266
I'm your private dancer.

01:22:54.436 --> 01:22:55.903
- You're a bag of crap.
- Shut up!

01:22:56.071 --> 01:22:58.562
- You shut up!
- What are you doing?

01:22:58.740 --> 01:23:01.800
Okay. Super. So we're all on board.

01:23:01.977 --> 01:23:03.501
Stupid bag of crap.

01:23:04.079 --> 01:23:06.445
Any free landscaping you want.

01:23:06.614 --> 01:23:08.479
I'll trim your bush.

01:23:09.451 --> 01:23:11.715
How would you like me to...?
I don't want to talk about it.

01:23:15.357 --> 01:23:17.052
It's been a while.

01:23:22.397 --> 01:23:24.490
I forgot my line!

01:23:26.634 --> 01:23:29.364
Mom, privacy!

01:23:30.872 --> 01:23:33.397
Mom, privacy!

01:23:37.012 --> 01:23:38.707
Big truck.

01:23:42.717 --> 01:23:44.446
Nobody does anything...

01:23:49.724 --> 01:23:52.215
I'm supposed to leave my car here?

01:23:52.394 --> 01:23:55.056
You know what your problem is, Duff?
John.

01:23:55.230 --> 01:23:56.959
You know what...? Sorry.

01:23:58.500 --> 01:24:00.331
Okay, but I don't...

01:24:00.969 --> 01:24:04.461
...spoon until...

01:24:04.639 --> 01:24:06.004
...after.

01:24:06.207 --> 01:24:08.903
Your head is so yellow and furry.

01:24:12.547 --> 01:24:14.879
I don't look fat in this, do I?

01:24:16.684 --> 01:24:18.481
- We've been doing it...
- I know.

01:24:18.653 --> 01:24:21.679
...a lot.
- Doing it and doing it right

01:24:21.856 --> 01:24:22.845
Hi, Duff.

01:24:27.829 --> 01:24:30.093
Get on the floor!

01:24:30.265 --> 01:24:31.698
And...

01:24:33.802 --> 01:24:35.963
Okay, I want the money.

01:24:36.137 --> 01:24:37.604
Now.

01:24:38.106 --> 01:24:39.095
Now.

01:24:41.843 --> 01:24:44.243
Spooning feels dirty.

01:24:47.882 --> 01:24:50.009
I work hard for the money.

01:24:51.252 --> 01:24:53.277
So hard for the money.

01:24:58.259 --> 01:25:00.193
- Tuna.
- Oh, you...

01:25:02.430 --> 01:25:04.295
Hold on. One more time.
Keep going.

01:25:04.466 --> 01:25:08.027
Holding. Anytime.

01:25:08.570 --> 01:25:10.299
One more time.

01:25:15.276 --> 01:25:17.767
All right. Cut.

01:25:19.514 --> 01:25:22.312
That's what I'm talking about.
