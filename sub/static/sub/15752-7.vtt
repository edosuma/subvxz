08:41.020 --> 08:43.423
"hardly perceptible
on the horizon,

08:43.423 --> 08:45.693
mirrored
my imperceptible heart."

08:45.693 --> 08:47.961
I'm just wondering
if we need the "cold."

08:47.961 --> 08:51.264
I think it's stronger
without it.

I agree.

where you write,

"After shutting ourselves
indoors for the winter

"like the first lingonberry

we bud miraculously."

09:16.189 --> 09:18.225
I'm just wondering
if "lingonberry"

09:18.225 --> 09:20.894
is meant to be plural...

09:20.894 --> 09:22.262
Oh, God.

09:22.262 --> 09:25.866
Anton, please don't worry
about the Swedish Fish.

I just want you to be
comfortable here.

09:27.935 --> 09:30.537
I am very comfortable,
I assure you.

like pervs to me.

last night?

10:09.977 --> 10:11.311
Yes,

10:11.311 --> 10:12.813

this morning.

10:12.813 --> 10:14.682
- Nice.
- Show me the money.

a little more booty *

Hey. Hey.
Gary. Gary!

10:43.677 --> 10:44.712
What happened?

10:44.712 --> 10:46.513
I just got sniffed
and stiffed.

10:46.513 --> 10:47.748
Ew.

hey *

10:53.186 --> 10:55.689
You always get the money first.
Didn't I mention that?

10:55.689 --> 10:56.824
It's okay.

10:56.824 --> 10:57.958
I don't think this
is my calling.

10:57.958 --> 10:59.259
I think I'm gonna
close up shop.

10:59.259 --> 11:01.261
Okay, well,
if you're interested,

11:01.261 --> 11:03.030
I have another gig for you.

11:03.030 --> 11:05.032
Okay.
I'm listening.

11:05.032 --> 11:07.400
So my friend Rakeem does PR
for a start-up

11:07.400 --> 11:09.636
that's throwing a launch party
for a new app

11:09.636 --> 11:11.438
called Getcha Buzz On.

11:11.438 --> 11:13.573
I'm sure they could use
a cocktail waitress tonight.

11:13.573 --> 11:15.743
I did a gig with Rakeem
and the beauty is,

11:15.743 --> 11:17.044
he pays in cash

11:17.044 --> 11:18.078
right after you turn in
your costume.

11:18.078 --> 11:19.179
Costume?

11:19.179 --> 11:20.814
Unless my ears
are deceiving me,

11:20.814 --> 11:22.615
that is my phone ringing
off the hook.

11:22.615 --> 11:24.551
Uh, I'm sorry.

11:24.551 --> 11:25.919
Where'd she go?

11:31.558 --> 11:32.893
I like your look.

11:32.893 --> 11:34.795
You're hot but not whorey.

11:34.795 --> 11:36.764
Uh, thanks.

11:36.764 --> 11:38.131
So what does this app do?

11:38.131 --> 11:40.167
It geolocates affiliated
liquor brands

11:40.167 --> 11:42.369
so you can buy drinks
using your Buzz Points.

11:42.369 --> 11:44.471
It sounds like a complicated way
to get a drink.

11:44.471 --> 11:45.906
You got that right.

11:45.906 --> 11:48.475
I like my liquor
and my men the same way:

11:48.475 --> 11:49.542
simple.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.078
Yeah.
Same here.

11:51.078 --> 11:52.679
All right,
you're good to go.

11:52.679 --> 11:53.881
Okay.

11:53.881 --> 11:54.882
Oh.

I know you.

12:12.332 --> 12:16.069
You work for Diana Trout.

12:16.069 --> 12:20.373
Well, obviously, I work in
publishing for love, not money.

12:20.373 --> 12:21.809
Buzzy navel?

12:21.809 --> 12:23.410
Oh.

12:23.410 --> 12:26.646
Glad to meet a girl who's not
living off her trust fund.

12:26.646 --> 12:27.948
Trust fund?

12:27.948 --> 12:29.249
My father's a high school
gym teacher

12:29.249 --> 12:30.383
in Maplewood, New Jersey.

12:30.383 --> 12:32.652
And is marketing
your passion?

12:32.652 --> 12:34.487
Well, my heart's
in editorial,

12:34.487 --> 12:37.490
but it's, uh--
yeah, it's very valuable

12:37.490 --> 12:38.826
learning from Diana.

12:38.826 --> 12:41.094
You're quite the politician.

12:41.094 --> 12:44.497
So what brings you out
to this fabulous bash?

12:44.497 --> 12:47.200
Oh, a friend of mine
is an investor.

12:47.200 --> 12:50.337
Also, I'm just trying
to get out there more,

12:50.337 --> 12:54.141
expand my comfort zone
since my divorce.

12:54.141 --> 12:55.843
Those first few months
are tough.

12:55.843 --> 12:57.377
I totally understand.

12:57.377 --> 12:59.212
I mean, not--
I don't understand,

12:59.212 --> 13:00.848
like personally,
but I--

13:00.848 --> 13:04.151
I've read many novels
with divorced characters.

13:04.151 --> 13:06.486
Well, here's to
a bright future

13:06.486 --> 13:08.856
and fewer parties
like this one

13:08.856 --> 13:10.057
for both of us.

13:10.057 --> 13:12.159
Sorry, I can't drink
on the job.

Uh...

13:20.033 --> 13:21.869
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

13:21.869 --> 13:23.270
I am so sorry.
I'm really--

13:23.270 --> 13:24.637
I'm really sorry.

13:24.637 --> 13:26.874
I think you're done here
for the night.

13:26.874 --> 13:27.975
Yeah.
Yeah.

I think so too.
Okay.

Wait, you didn't get paid?

13:33.914 --> 13:35.115
Paid?

13:35.115 --> 13:36.416
I'm lucky
I didn't have to pay

calfskin jacket.

Oh.

13:40.153 --> 13:41.989
You know, if you're really
strapped for cash,

13:41.989 --> 13:43.891
you could always
sell your eggs.

13:46.159 --> 13:48.561
I saw your spill last night.

13:48.561 --> 13:50.663
I think you better
stick to publishing.

13:50.663 --> 13:51.698
I'm just saying.

13:51.698 --> 13:52.765
Well, as long as
I still get to

in the office.

Why is he talking to you?

14:03.443 --> 14:05.745
Uh, it's--
it was nothing.

14:05.745 --> 14:07.347
I know an inside joke
when I see one.

Get in here.

[door bangs]

And?

14:14.221 --> 14:15.688
We ran into each other
at this party last night.

14:15.688 --> 14:17.724
What kind of party would
you be at with Charles?

14:17.724 --> 14:19.259
Well, I wasn't
exactly a guest.

14:19.259 --> 14:20.961
I was working...

14:20.961 --> 14:22.529
as a caterer.

14:22.529 --> 14:24.297
Actually, more as
a bartendress.

14:24.297 --> 14:25.798
You were serving people?

14:25.798 --> 14:27.400
Well, I need to make
some extra money.

14:27.400 --> 14:29.502
I have this
student loan payment

14:29.502 --> 14:30.938
of, like, $1,800 due,

14:30.938 --> 14:32.772
and they're totally
harassing me and--

14:32.772 --> 14:33.773
I see.

14:33.773 --> 14:36.376
So tell me...

14:37.710 --> 14:40.647
What's Charles like
in the wild?

14:40.647 --> 14:43.683
Actually,
he's a little dorky.

14:43.683 --> 14:44.684
Dorky?

14:44.684 --> 14:45.752
Yeah.

14:45.752 --> 14:46.619
I mean, he's at
this cool party

14:46.619 --> 14:47.854
at this very happening club.

14:47.854 --> 14:49.556
- Mm-hmm.
- Very young crowd.

14:49.556 --> 14:50.690
Like, nobody over 30,

14:50.690 --> 14:51.959
and they're all partying--

14:51.959 --> 14:53.093
On a Tuesday night?

14:53.093 --> 14:55.628
And was Charles...
partying?

14:55.628 --> 14:56.964
No.
I mean, that's my point.

14:56.964 --> 14:58.098
He wasn't.

14:58.098 --> 14:59.299
He didn't look very
comfortable there.

14:59.299 --> 15:00.700
Oh, thank God.

15:00.700 --> 15:02.102
I mean, it was like he was
going through the motions

15:02.102 --> 15:03.803
of trying to have a good time,
but you could tell

15:03.803 --> 15:06.239
he was just kind of forcing
himself to get out there.

15:06.239 --> 15:07.274
Did he bring a date?

15:07.274 --> 15:09.109
Definitely not.
He was alone.

15:09.109 --> 15:11.611
All alone at a hot party.

15:11.611 --> 15:12.579
Sad.

15:12.579 --> 15:13.880
Men are so desperate.

15:13.880 --> 15:15.682
I do think he's feeling
a little adrift

15:15.682 --> 15:18.885
since the divorce, which,
you know, it's totally normal.

15:18.885 --> 15:21.989
And where do you gather these
little nuggets of wisdom from?

15:21.989 --> 15:23.090
BuzzFeed?

15:23.090 --> 15:24.591
It was just an observation.

15:24.591 --> 15:26.593
The headline here, Liza,
is that girls who work for me

15:26.593 --> 15:28.295
shouldn't spend their nights
cocktail waitressing.

15:28.295 --> 15:29.529
It's very bad form.

15:29.529 --> 15:31.664

I want you doing

15:31.664 --> 15:33.266

he is a little kinky.

this guy degrade you.

16:02.329 --> 16:03.830

in a coffee shop bathroom

16:06.666 --> 16:08.535

17:34.521 --> 17:35.655
[speaks Swedish]
Please.

17:35.655 --> 17:39.126
Some...
[speaking Swedish]

17:39.126 --> 17:41.794
I am not your girlfriend,
Anton.

17:41.794 --> 17:43.330
I'm your editor.

17:43.330 --> 17:45.565
Oh.
I'm sorry.

17:45.565 --> 17:48.935
I mean, my editor.

17:57.144 --> 17:59.212
Bring me the catalog copy
for the Bjornberg book.

17:59.212 --> 18:02.815
I looked for it on your desk,
but it was a rat's nest.

18:02.815 --> 18:05.218
Sure.
I'll go find it.

18:23.069 --> 18:24.304
Diana,

18:24.304 --> 18:25.605
this is generous of you,

18:25.605 --> 18:26.906
but I couldn't possibly
take this.

18:26.906 --> 18:30.777
Consider it an early
Christmas bonus.

18:30.777 --> 18:33.180
You have no idea how much
this means to me.

18:33.180 --> 18:35.182
I don't know how to thank you.

18:35.182 --> 18:36.616
Well,

18:36.616 --> 18:39.652
you can start by bringing me
that catalog copy I asked for.

18:39.652 --> 18:41.988
Of course.

18:41.988 --> 18:43.089
And Charles is not dorky.

18:43.089 --> 18:44.524
You don't know him at all.

18:44.524 --> 18:47.059
She doesn't know him at all.

18:54.667 --> 18:55.668
Hey.

18:55.668 --> 18:58.004
Hey.

18:58.004 --> 18:59.806
[clears throat]

18:59.806 --> 19:02.409
[sighs]

19:03.443 --> 19:05.312
So what's going on
with you?

19:05.312 --> 19:06.846
Hmm?

19:06.846 --> 19:09.316
Nothing.
Why?

19:09.316 --> 19:10.417
Well,

19:10.417 --> 19:12.752
you've been acting
a little weird.

19:12.752 --> 19:14.621
I am weird.

19:14.621 --> 19:17.890
I mean, you've been making
phone calls in the bathroom,

19:17.890 --> 19:20.126
hiding emails.

19:20.126 --> 19:23.963
I just feel like
you're acting sketchy.

19:23.963 --> 19:27.234
Okay,
um...

19:27.234 --> 19:29.469
All right,
the truth is...

19:32.104 --> 19:34.707
I have been short on cash,

19:34.707 --> 19:38.878
so I made an ill-fated attempt
to sell my used underwear.

19:38.878 --> 19:40.112
Wait.
What?

19:40.112 --> 19:44.784
Here.
You can read the emails.

19:44.784 --> 19:47.787
- Okay.
- Yeah.

19:47.787 --> 19:49.121
[chuckles]

19:49.121 --> 19:51.958
And how much did my
sexy girlfriend profit

19:51.958 --> 19:54.527
from this very
questionable transaction?

19:54.527 --> 19:56.896
$1,800.

19:56.896 --> 19:57.930
Yeah.

19:57.930 --> 19:59.131
Wow.

19:59.131 --> 20:00.467
Uh, how much do you think

20:00.467 --> 20:03.570
a pair of American Apparel
boxer briefs

20:03.570 --> 20:05.171
with a slightly blown-out
waistband are going for--

20:05.171 --> 20:06.172
No, I'm out
of the business.

20:06.172 --> 20:08.441
Ah.
Just ballpark it.

20:08.441 --> 20:11.844
(man)
Josh. Let's go.

20:11.844 --> 20:13.513
Hey.

20:13.513 --> 20:16.082
Thanks for being so honest,
groupie.

20:18.785 --> 20:21.721
[band warming up]

20:23.756 --> 20:25.525
[phone chimes]

20:29.128 --> 20:31.731
(man)
One, two, three...

20:31.731 --> 20:34.601
[bluegrass music playing]

20:34.601 --> 20:35.602
(woman)
Whoo!

20:35.602 --> 20:36.936
(man)
Yeah!

20:36.936 --> 20:39.672
