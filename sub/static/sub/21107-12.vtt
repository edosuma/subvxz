10:35.701 --> 10:37.369
Did you hear that?

10:37.371 --> 10:41.339
Jett Black says
he'll always remember you.

10:43.175 --> 10:46.578
Okay, here goes nothing.

10:49.048 --> 10:49.648
(GASPS)

10:49.650 --> 10:52.884
Aunt Lydia,
I'm so glad you're okay.

10:52.886 --> 10:54.719
Why are you trying
to upper five me

10:54.721 --> 10:56.655
when there is work
to be done?

10:56.657 --> 10:58.023
I know, and I'm sorry.

10:58.025 --> 11:02.627
I realize now that
managing this place
isn't a one-monster job.

11:02.629 --> 11:07.666
That is a very grown-up lesson
to have learned, Mavis.

11:07.668 --> 11:10.368
So I'm not being punished?

11:10.370 --> 11:11.436
Of course you are.

11:11.438 --> 11:14.439
The Scream Stone
needs to be polished.

11:14.774 --> 11:15.840
Oh, no.

11:15.842 --> 11:17.676
(SCREAMING)

11:20.746 --> 11:22.847
(BATS SQUEAKING)

11:25.017 --> 11:27.052
(WAILING)

11:28.854 --> 11:29.921
Ooh, ooh,
let me guess.

11:29.923 --> 11:33.792
The Cerberus beat him
to the Mice Crispy
squares again?

11:35.127 --> 11:36.695
(BELCHING)

11:36.697 --> 11:38.463
Uh, yes,
but that's not it.

11:38.465 --> 11:41.833
Pedro found out
his mom's finally
coming to visit.

11:41.835 --> 11:42.701
(SQUEALS)

11:42.703 --> 11:45.070
A mummy mommy
is so much fun!

11:45.072 --> 11:46.938
No, it isn't!

11:46.940 --> 11:49.541
Because of my brother Rusty.

11:49.543 --> 11:50.475
(WHISTLE BLOWS)

11:50.477 --> 11:53.411
PEDRO: <i>He's a superstar.</i>

11:53.979 --> 11:57.582
(SIGHS) My mommy...
Yes, I still call her mommy.

11:57.584 --> 11:59.250
Let's not rehash that.

11:59.252 --> 12:02.520
...is always bragging
about how great Rusty is.

12:02.522 --> 12:04.889
How responsible
Rusty is.

12:04.891 --> 12:06.825
How "rusty" Rusty is.

12:06.827 --> 12:08.560
So I got jealous

12:08.562 --> 12:13.598
and kind of maybe told her
I sort of run the hotel.

12:13.600 --> 12:14.532
ALL: What?

12:14.534 --> 12:16.301
So you lied
to your mummy mommy?

12:16.303 --> 12:18.937
Now she's popping by
on her way to Spookarest,

12:18.939 --> 12:21.039
and she's going to
find out my only job

12:21.041 --> 12:24.943
is to flip a dumb switch
that doesn't do anything.

12:27.713 --> 12:28.179
You see?

12:28.181 --> 12:32.784
(SIGHS) She's gonna think
I'm such a disappointment.

12:33.285 --> 12:34.819
Pedro, we've got this.

12:34.821 --> 12:36.855
All we have to do
is let you run the hotel

12:36.857 --> 12:38.189
while your mommy
is here,

12:38.191 --> 12:40.992
and she'll think
you're a superstar, too.

12:40.994 --> 12:42.694
You'd do that for me?

12:42.696 --> 12:43.361
Of course.

12:43.363 --> 12:45.630
I know a thing or two
about having to live up

12:45.632 --> 12:48.767
to a parent's
high expectations.

12:48.769 --> 12:52.103
Stop looking at me
like that.

12:52.105 --> 12:54.806
Yeah, being the spare parts
son of Frankenstein

12:54.808 --> 12:57.108
is no bed of nails either.

12:57.110 --> 12:58.443
I'm in, too.

12:59.278 --> 13:01.946
I'm unconditionally loved.

13:03.449 --> 13:06.518
Mmm, direct deposit.

13:07.419 --> 13:08.186
Okay, listen up.

13:08.188 --> 13:11.055
As long as Pedro's mom
is here, he's in charge.

13:11.057 --> 13:14.425
You take orders from no one
but Pedro, got it?

13:14.427 --> 13:16.194
What about the real boss
of Hotel Transylvania?

13:16.196 --> 13:20.231
Luckily, she just got
Cornelius Shivers'
new romance novel.

13:20.233 --> 13:22.867
She'll be lost to it
for hours.

13:22.869 --> 13:24.869
(TIRES SQUEALING)

13:26.605 --> 13:30.241
Pedro, my dear,
your mommy is here.

13:30.243 --> 13:34.646
Mommy! Mommy!
Welcome to the hotel!
Pedro.

13:34.648 --> 13:37.682
Oh, right.
I mean, my hotel.

13:37.684 --> 13:43.087
Hmm. Rusty can't believe
Dracula would leave you
in charge

13:43.089 --> 13:45.089
of Hotel Transylvania.

13:45.091 --> 13:48.760
Rusty thinks you're
full of boo-loney.

13:48.762 --> 13:50.328
Rusty.

13:50.863 --> 13:52.597
(FLY BUZZING)

13:55.034 --> 13:57.268
Now, I don't know
who to believe,

13:57.270 --> 13:59.237
so I came to see for myself.

13:59.239 --> 14:03.041
Um, Pedro, maybe your mother
would like a hot drink.

14:03.043 --> 14:05.710
Well, I could use
something scalding

14:05.712 --> 14:08.346
to burn the skin off
the roof of my mouth.

14:08.348 --> 14:10.014
It's a new thing
I'm trying.

14:10.016 --> 14:12.584
Mavis, my mother's drink.

14:12.586 --> 14:13.985
Yes, boss.

14:15.654 --> 14:18.823
(SLURPS) Hmm,
they're listening to you.

14:18.825 --> 14:21.826
Maybe you really are
in charge of the hotel.

14:21.828 --> 14:24.195
Yeah. I totally am.

14:24.197 --> 14:25.196
(STUTTERS) Check this.

14:25.198 --> 14:28.967
Hey, you, stop loafing
around and, uh...

14:28.969 --> 14:32.604
Clean the invisible sofa.
Uh, yes, sir.

14:32.606 --> 14:33.104
(SQUEAKING)

14:33.106 --> 14:36.674
Hey, don't just pretend
to clean it, dude.

14:36.676 --> 14:38.376
Actually clean it.

14:38.378 --> 14:40.311
(GRUNTS)
(RAPID SQUEAKING)

14:41.046 --> 14:42.580
Watch this, Mommy.

14:42.582 --> 14:44.916
Zombies, make a pyramid.

14:45.985 --> 14:47.585
(GRUNTS) Ha!

14:47.587 --> 14:48.987
Now that would
be impressive,

14:48.989 --> 14:53.524
but Rusty did the same thing
once with monster trucks,

14:53.526 --> 14:55.793
only upside down.

14:59.465 --> 15:01.332
<i>That didn't end so well.</i>

15:01.334 --> 15:04.435
Okay, Pedro, maybe it's time
to say bye to your mom

15:04.437 --> 15:05.637
and see her off
to Spookarest.

15:05.639 --> 15:08.139
You know, before
Aunt Lydia finds out.

15:08.141 --> 15:10.875
No way.
I got to top Rusty.

15:10.877 --> 15:12.944
Whoa! (GROANS)

15:13.545 --> 15:17.916
Ah! I can't believe Pedro made
me braid Bigfoot's toe hair.

15:17.918 --> 15:19.450
I don't even work here.

15:19.452 --> 15:21.152
Uh, do you want to trade?

15:21.154 --> 15:23.821
AUNT LYDIA:
What is going on here?
(SCREAMS)

15:25.391 --> 15:28.559
Am I standing in slug guts?

15:28.561 --> 15:29.694
(CLUCKING)

15:29.696 --> 15:30.995
You sure are.

15:30.997 --> 15:32.297
My son's idea.

15:32.299 --> 15:36.334
He thought they'd attract
better quality zombies.

15:36.769 --> 15:38.503
(CROAKING)

15:38.505 --> 15:40.471
And just who
is your son?

15:40.473 --> 15:44.776
The one and only
Pedro Moomay, of course.

15:44.778 --> 15:47.812
He's in charge.
Mmm-hmm.

15:47.814 --> 15:49.647
Oh, really?

15:49.649 --> 15:51.149
Oh, skull snaps.

15:51.151 --> 15:54.953
Son, you need to
send her to the dungeon

15:54.955 --> 15:57.288
for glaring at you
like that.

15:57.290 --> 15:58.790
Rusty would.

15:58.792 --> 16:01.793
Uh, no problemo.

16:01.795 --> 16:04.295
Don't do it.
Ixnay.

16:04.297 --> 16:05.496
Whoa!

16:06.966 --> 16:08.166
Oh, no.

16:08.168 --> 16:11.903
You will, uh, do as I say.

16:11.905 --> 16:12.704
(WHISPERS) Wink, wink.

16:12.706 --> 16:14.605
Do you have something
in your eye, child?

16:14.607 --> 16:16.841
Has it infected
your brain?

16:16.843 --> 16:19.644
(CLEARS THROAT)
I order you to the dungeon!

16:19.646 --> 16:21.612
(SOFTLY) If you don't mind,
pretty please.

16:21.614 --> 16:24.949
You order me?

16:25.050 --> 16:28.553
No, no, I ordered you,
"wink, wink."

16:30.222 --> 16:31.522

Aunt Lydia?

16:40.800 --> 16:42.100
Uh...

16:42.102 --> 16:46.704
Wow. Rusty never did
anything like that before.

16:46.706 --> 16:50.508
He didn't?
I mean, oh, no, he didn't!

16:50.510 --> 16:52.977
All hail King Pedro.

16:52.979 --> 16:55.580
King Pedro! Whee!

17:01.253 --> 17:01.919
(YAWNS)

17:01.921 --> 17:04.055
Pedro, this needs
to stop.

17:04.057 --> 17:06.557
Hey, he called me
King Pedro.

17:06.559 --> 17:08.992
And this was your idea.

17:08.994 --> 17:10.294
Oh, come on.

17:10.296 --> 17:11.896
Aunt Lydia
is gonna wake up,

17:11.897 --> 17:15.333
and when she does
you need to be far,
far away.

17:15.335 --> 17:17.167
Like Jupiter far.

17:17.435 --> 17:19.537
Not sure that's
gonna be enough.

17:19.539 --> 17:22.839
Oh, Pedro, my baby,

17:22.842 --> 17:25.843
I am so proud of you.

17:25.845 --> 17:27.345
I'm not going anywhere.

17:27.347 --> 17:30.948
Did you hear that?
I'm finally the
number one son.

17:30.950 --> 17:34.419
How you like them
crabapples, Rusty?

17:34.653 --> 17:36.354
(BLOWS WHISTLE WEAKLY)

17:36.722 --> 17:37.588
Ugh!

17:37.590 --> 17:40.491
Just do this one last thing,
and I promise I'll end it.

17:40.493 --> 17:43.327
Ugh! Fine.
As you wish, King Pedro.

17:43.329 --> 17:45.930
One last thing.
But don't make things worse.

17:45.932 --> 17:51.069
Don't worry, I'll keep things
on the down-low, trust me.

Ah. So cute.

18:01.714 --> 18:05.016
Uh, why are we still
going along with this?

18:07.319 --> 18:09.220
You going to argue
with them?

18:09.222 --> 18:14.826
(YAWNS) Being in charge
is so exhausting.

18:14.828 --> 18:16.127
Mmm-hmm. That's right.

18:16.129 --> 18:20.131
Only the best fruit mold
for my handsome boy.

18:20.133 --> 18:23.267
Ew! This mold
has fruit on it!

18:23.269 --> 18:24.802
How dare you?

18:24.804 --> 18:26.871
To the dungeon with you!

Ooh, look at my little
bandage boss

18:30.844 --> 18:34.011
wield power
in such a reckless way.

18:34.013 --> 18:37.648
Oh, come on, Pedro,
it was just an accident.

18:37.650 --> 18:39.083
Let him go.

18:40.119 --> 18:41.953
He locked you
in the dungeon?

18:41.955 --> 18:44.622
He sent all of us down here
for not following orders.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.524
I'm in for not kneeling
fast enough.

18:46.526 --> 18:51.062
Okay, you guys, sit tight.
I'll get Pedro to end this.

18:51.064 --> 18:52.230
Uh, could you hurry?

18:52.232 --> 18:55.166
I don't think these dungeons
have bathrooms.

18:55.701 --> 18:59.036
Pedro, you have to
come clean to your mom now.

18:59.038 --> 19:00.872
If you don't, I will.

19:00.874 --> 19:03.741
You can't do that.
It's against the code.

19:03.743 --> 19:06.010
Never rat a friend out
to their parents.

19:06.012 --> 19:10.114
What about the code of
not putting your friends
in a dungeon?

19:10.116 --> 19:10.715
Doesn't ring a bell.

19:10.717 --> 19:13.518
Besides, why would I
want to change anything?

19:13.520 --> 19:15.720
My mommy thinks
I'm a success,

19:15.722 --> 19:19.056

coming up Pedro.

with all this racket?

19:23.730 --> 19:25.429
Pedro, make it stop.

19:25.431 --> 19:29.367
I'm on it, Mommy.
Noise, you're fired.

19:30.135 --> 19:31.936
The noise isn't
listening to you.

19:31.938 --> 19:36.707
The hotel is falling apart
under your rule, King Pedro.

19:36.709 --> 19:39.677
What? It can't fall apart.
I just got it.

19:39.679 --> 19:41.512
Mavis, you got to
do something.

19:41.514 --> 19:44.482

smell Mice Crispies?

This is the worst!

ate all those.

back some, if you can.

The build-up of methane gas

is it to open it?

20:14.647 --> 20:16.948
(COUGHS)
Oh, wait a sec.

20:16.950 --> 20:19.584
That wire must
open the vent.

Pedro, the switch.

20:34.067 --> 20:35.533
It actually
does something.

20:35.535 --> 20:38.236
We need to flip it
to release Cerberus' gas.

20:38.238 --> 20:41.339
And it only works
with your bandage print.

20:41.341 --> 20:42.873

20:44.610 --> 20:47.411
Ah! We're stuck
in slug guts.

20:47.413 --> 20:48.579
What do we do?

20:48.581 --> 20:50.114
Hmm. (GASPS)

20:50.215 --> 20:51.382
A-ha!
Huh?

20:51.384 --> 20:53.618
Time for you
to be the hero.

20:53.620 --> 20:54.885
Hey!

20:55.220 --> 20:57.255
Oh, I got this.

21:13.172 --> 21:16.240
Mommy, I'm not in charge
of the hotel.

21:16.242 --> 21:20.111
I'm never going to be
a big shot like Rusty.

21:20.113 --> 21:22.413
(BLOWING WHISTLE)

21:22.581 --> 21:23.414
I'm sorry I lied.

21:23.416 --> 21:25.549
I just wanted you
to be proud of me.

21:25.551 --> 21:27.718
But I am proud of you.

21:27.720 --> 21:30.354
You saved the hotel
from being destroyed.

21:30.356 --> 21:34.925
Uh, well, it was my idea
to use the bandage
as a lasso and...

21:34.927 --> 21:36.060
Not now, Mavis.

21:36.062 --> 21:38.062
You're right.
I'm a hero.

21:38.064 --> 21:41.265
I saved the hotel.
I save it every day.

21:41.267 --> 21:43.801
Now you're getting a little
carried away again.

21:43.803 --> 21:47.238
All hail King Pedro!

21:47.240 --> 21:49.106
That's my baby.

21:49.108 --> 21:50.875
(AIR WHOOSHING)
Uh-oh.

21:50.877 --> 21:52.777
(GROWLING)

21:54.246 --> 21:56.180
Hey, what about
the friend code

21:56.182 --> 21:58.349
of sticking together
no matter what?

21:58.351 --> 22:00.751
MAVIS:
Sorry, not this time.
Good luck, King Pedro.

22:00.753 --> 22:02.253
MOTHER:
I'll miss you, baby boy.

22:02.255 --> 22:04.789

CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)
