00:12.470 --> 00:14.431
[Alexa] High school was going pretty good.

00:14.514 --> 00:18.560
Katie and I both had our new wigs,
and no one even knew I had cancer.

00:18.643 --> 00:20.854
The best part of our day was lunch.

00:20.937 --> 00:22.939
It had two of my favorite things:

00:23.022 --> 00:24.649
food and gossip.

00:26.526 --> 00:28.194
OK, gossip.

00:29.237 --> 00:31.906
I heard Courtney Stillman
is in a Target commercial.

00:31.990 --> 00:34.159
I heard Lorraine and Tanya
are fighting again.

00:34.242 --> 00:36.369
We're not talking about
your great-aunts, Hannah.

00:36.453 --> 00:37.454
It's still juicy.

00:38.371 --> 00:39.706
[whispers] Tell me later.

00:41.082 --> 00:43.418
I heard that a girl in our grade
has cancer.

00:45.712 --> 00:48.339
[stammers and chuckles]
Nobody likes a gossip, Toby.

00:49.924 --> 00:51.426
You guys, who told?

00:51.509 --> 00:53.428
-I didn't tell.
-I didn't tell.

00:54.095 --> 00:55.889
-I told.
-Hannah!

00:56.890 --> 01:00.810
-Who did you tell?
-Lady Gaga. But it was just in a dream.

01:01.394 --> 01:05.231
We also ate apples dipped in chocolate
and I flew on her back.

01:06.691 --> 01:09.736
Oh, OK, so people know,
but they don't know it's you.

01:09.819 --> 01:12.906
Everyone will figure it out when I don't
try out for basketball this week.

01:12.989 --> 01:15.784
Who are these people
following your every move?

01:16.367 --> 01:18.745
People do, Katie. They just do.

01:20.288 --> 01:21.289
[Gwenny] Oh!

01:21.372 --> 01:24.125
Hey, Alexa. Look at you, sitting down.

01:24.209 --> 01:26.795
That will be great practice
for warming the bench this year.

01:26.878 --> 01:27.879
[Gwenny's friends laugh]

01:27.962 --> 01:29.881
Oh, it's you, Gwenny!

01:29.964 --> 01:31.549
Well, that explains the smell.

01:31.633 --> 01:33.218
I thought a rat died in the vent.

01:33.301 --> 01:34.552
[Alexa's friends laugh]

01:34.636 --> 01:36.513
[feigns laughter] Go ahead and laugh.

01:36.596 --> 01:39.390
You'll be crying Friday
when I beat you out for point guard.

01:39.474 --> 01:40.600
Ha!

01:40.683 --> 01:43.728
Joke's on you, Gwenny.
She can't try out this year.

01:43.812 --> 01:45.271
-Hannah!
-Why not?

01:47.023 --> 01:49.692
Because I'm joining an after-school club.

01:49.776 --> 01:50.819
The Losers Club?

01:51.945 --> 01:53.571
That's not even a thing.

01:53.655 --> 01:57.367

it would be made of you.

Hi, sweetheart. How was school?

03:13.985 --> 03:16.195
Horrible.
I can't be on the basketball team.

03:16.696 --> 03:17.739
Oh, honey.

03:17.822 --> 03:21.034

Sorry. Your illness has made me
a little extra protective.

-I shouldn't have said that.
-No, no, that's good. Lean into that.

03:32.503 --> 03:34.714
-I have good news.
-Ooh! What is it? What is it?

03:34.797 --> 03:35.965
Ah, hold on.

03:36.049 --> 03:37.675
I've been burned by this before.

from work a little early every day.

03:41.721 --> 03:44.557
-Oh, I'm aware.
-Mm. I won't be doing that any more.

03:44.974 --> 03:45.808
Wow.

03:46.142 --> 03:47.727
Ms. Ember and I put our heads together

03:47.810 --> 03:50.355

I could work from home.

I've, uh, got the height?

10:50.024 --> 10:51.692
You just need a better coach.

10:51.776 --> 10:55.029
I'm doing just fine, Lucas.
She just needs to concentrate.

10:55.112 --> 10:56.238
Right, Katie?

10:56.947 --> 10:57.948
Katie?

10:58.824 --> 10:59.909

11:01.202 --> 11:04.747
You know what?
Maybe you do need a better coach.

11:04.830 --> 11:06.457
Lucas is a great coach.

11:07.083 --> 11:09.168
Some people say I can be a great coach,

11:09.251 --> 11:10.544
some say I have great hair.

11:10.628 --> 11:11.671
I say both can be true.

11:12.797 --> 11:14.757
How would you like Lucas to be your coach?

11:15.216 --> 11:17.009
I guess that would be all right.

11:17.093 --> 11:19.220
Yeah, I can give you some pointers
sometime, Katie.

11:19.303 --> 11:21.514
Cool! Tomorrow's good.

11:21.597 --> 11:24.517
Or the next day,
but I can move stuff if I have to.

-Not if I text you first!

11:41.617 --> 11:43.035

11:43.119 --> 11:46.705
I came down here for breakfast,
like always, and there's no breakfast.

11:47.498 --> 11:48.833
Just this empty plate.

11:50.709 --> 11:51.752

11:51.836 --> 11:54.046
I tried that. I'm out of ideas.

11:55.381 --> 11:58.050

so she could do more for us.

since I got up this morning,

12:01.053 --> 12:02.638

12:02.930 --> 12:05.641
Don't look at me.
I don't know where the warm things are.

12:06.725 --> 12:07.726

Can you get me the fuzzy afghan?

12:10.396 --> 12:11.522
And waffles?

12:13.107 --> 12:14.775

12:53.856 --> 12:55.065
Are you wearing make-up?

12:55.149 --> 12:58.277
I-I hugged my mom. Maybe some rubbed off.

13:00.863 --> 13:02.031
OK, Katie.

13:02.531 --> 13:03.741

13:09.288 --> 13:10.873
[stammers] Am I holding it right?

13:10.956 --> 13:12.791
No. You have to hold
your left hand under--

-Like this?
-Here, I'll show you.

13:19.465 --> 13:20.466

with your right hand and follow through.

Maybe defense is more your thing.

13:41.987 --> 13:43.822
I'm gonna try to score.
You try to guard me.

13:48.452 --> 13:49.828
Come in on me. Get closer.

13:50.371 --> 13:51.997
Wow. Yeah. Uh-huh. OK.

13:54.708 --> 13:57.127
Come on, Katie.
You've really got to get up on me.

14:04.260 --> 14:05.761
