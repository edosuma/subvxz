WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:03.440
Come on. We'll be late.

00:03.440 --> 00:05.800
I feel so bad about Ellen.
It's awful.

00:05.800 --> 00:07.800
Like she's just disappeared.

00:07.800 --> 00:11.280
Can she really have been sent home
without even saying goodbye?

00:11.280 --> 00:14.040
It's practically the end of term.
We'll all be going home soon.

00:14.040 --> 00:17.680
If she is the thief, Miss Grayling
would be right to expel her.

00:17.680 --> 00:20.760
And she was found with Mr Parker's
pen in her hands.

00:22.160 --> 00:25.960
If she stole anything, her trunk's
the most obvious place to hide it.

00:25.960 --> 00:29.240
Look now before anyone comes.
They're bound to send it off today.

00:29.240 --> 00:31.720
We shouldn't normally go
through people's stuff, but...

00:40.240 --> 00:43.520
Apart from her blanket,
there's almost nothing here.

00:44.760 --> 00:46.840
Why's she taken all her things
with her already?

00:46.840 --> 00:48.320
This is all she has.

00:48.320 --> 00:50.880
She doesn't get pocket money
or presents like the rest of us.

00:50.880 --> 00:53.240
Which would explain
why she's stealing ours.

00:53.240 --> 00:55.960
Poor Ellen! I understand
she may have been tempted,

00:55.960 --> 00:57.680
but it's not an excuse for stealing.

00:57.680 --> 00:59.960
We haven't always made it easy
for her.

00:59.960 --> 01:01.560
We're so lucky.

01:01.560 --> 01:03.000
I really don't think she did it.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.360
But even if she did,
given the circumstances,

01:05.360 --> 01:07.720
don't you think
she deserves a second chance?

01:07.720 --> 01:09.720
No! Maybe she does.

01:09.720 --> 01:12.040
You're right, Jean.

01:12.040 --> 01:14.440
Everybody deserves a second chance.

01:14.440 --> 01:16.880
Perhaps the three of us should go
to Miss Grayling at break.

01:16.880 --> 01:19.920
You tell her your side of the story
with the pen,

01:19.920 --> 01:21.440
I'll explain how we feel,

01:21.440 --> 01:24.200
and you put a good word in
for Ellen's character.

01:24.200 --> 01:26.160
Good plan. Count me in.

01:26.160 --> 01:27.640
Me, too.

01:31.760 --> 01:33.400
SHE SIGHS

02:00.400 --> 02:01.960
BELL RINGS

02:01.960 --> 02:03.320
Oh!

02:06.240 --> 02:07.600
Gwen?

02:07.600 --> 02:10.000
Come on, slowcoach,
you'll be late for class.

02:11.320 --> 02:12.880
What are you doing?

02:12.880 --> 02:14.400
My last brown envelope ripped.

02:16.440 --> 02:18.440
It's a disaster! You...

02:18.440 --> 02:21.880
you don't happen to have some brown
paper, string and stamps, do you?

02:21.880 --> 02:23.960
Oh, who's the parcel for?

02:23.960 --> 02:25.880
It's my mother's birthday tomorrow.

02:25.880 --> 02:27.440
BELL RINGS

02:27.440 --> 02:29.000
Come on, second bell!

02:35.640 --> 02:37.000
Gwen?

02:45.800 --> 02:47.560
Why can't you give it to her
tomorrow?

02:47.560 --> 02:50.240
My governess is collecting me.
I'm with her for a few weeks,

02:50.240 --> 02:52.600
but I've already told my mother
I'd posted it.

02:52.600 --> 02:55.520
I'll be in such terrible trouble
if she finds out I lied.

02:55.520 --> 02:59.000
Poor Gwen. I don't have stamps,
but I have paper and string.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.560
Would you leave it on my bed
at break? Of course.

03:01.560 --> 03:04.000
I just wish I could do more to help.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.800
I'll have to borrow money
for postage.

03:05.800 --> 03:06.960
It's bound to be pricey.

03:06.960 --> 03:09.600
Would you mind excusing me to
Mr Parker?

03:09.600 --> 03:12.360
Just say I went to speak to
Matron or something.

03:17.680 --> 03:19.520
Thank you so much.

03:19.520 --> 03:21.520
You're my only real friend,
Mary-Lou.

03:50.280 --> 03:51.640
Is that the report schedule?

03:51.640 --> 03:55.560
No lessons after the break, packing,
tidying and individual critique.

03:55.560 --> 03:57.160
Check your times.

03:57.160 --> 03:58.680
Any luck?

04:00.080 --> 04:03.320
Collecting for the orphanage.
Nearly at a guinea already.

04:06.440 --> 04:09.000
Mam'zelle put in
a ten shilling note.

04:14.760 --> 04:17.400
Oh! So generous, Mr Parker.

04:20.840 --> 04:24.680
Of course, Mr Thomas,
business is business,

04:24.680 --> 04:27.560
but education
and youth are also worth developing.

04:27.560 --> 04:29.200
KNOCK AT DOOR

04:29.200 --> 04:30.800
One moment!

04:30.800 --> 04:34.720
Just before you go, Mr Thomas,
I am begging you to reconsider.

04:34.720 --> 04:38.000
Invest in the school,
not in tearing it down.

04:41.960 --> 04:43.640
KNOCK AT DOOR

04:45.480 --> 04:46.720
Come in.

04:48.480 --> 04:50.600
Girls. What can I do for you?

04:50.600 --> 04:52.280
We've come about Ellen,
Miss Grayling.

04:52.280 --> 04:54.440
We feel terrible that
she's been expelled and I think

04:54.440 --> 04:56.440
it's partly my fault
for handling things badly.

04:56.440 --> 04:58.240
Who told you Ellen was expelled?

04:58.240 --> 05:00.400
We weren't told as such,
but after what happened,

05:00.400 --> 05:02.240
when she wasn't in the dorm
this morning...

05:02.240 --> 05:04.280
We put two and two together.

05:04.280 --> 05:07.880
Perhaps you should put what happened
into your own words.

05:07.880 --> 05:09.440
Well, um...

05:11.920 --> 05:14.520
People's things have been
going missing all term.

05:14.520 --> 05:16.600
And there have been theories
and accusations.

05:16.600 --> 05:18.040
This is the first I've heard of it!

05:18.040 --> 05:20.600
We didn't want to bother you,
not until we had proof.

05:20.600 --> 05:23.640
But then, when I found her rummaging
through Mr Parker's drawer

05:23.640 --> 05:26.160
and taking his pen...
You caught her doing this?

05:26.160 --> 05:28.320
Yes, and I lost my temper and said

05:28.320 --> 05:30.320
that she must do the right thing
and own up to you.

05:31.360 --> 05:33.160
Indeed.

05:33.160 --> 05:36.520
And so, you have concluded
she came to me and confessed,

05:36.520 --> 05:38.680
and I expelled her for thieving?

05:41.920 --> 05:44.120
And what have you come to ask me?

05:44.120 --> 05:45.760
We wanted to put in a good word.

05:45.760 --> 05:47.960
She is a good person, she truly is.

05:50.680 --> 05:52.320
Thank you, girls.

05:52.320 --> 05:53.800
I will look into this further.

05:56.040 --> 05:59.440
I wish she hadn't been expelled,
even if she did it.

05:59.440 --> 06:00.880
She was my friend.

06:00.880 --> 06:03.160
It was really brave of her
to turn herself in.

06:03.160 --> 06:04.520
She can't be all that bad.

06:04.520 --> 06:06.320
I will give this thought.

06:06.320 --> 06:08.200
No-one is ever all bad.

06:14.520 --> 06:16.200
MATRON HUMS A TUNE

06:26.080 --> 06:27.840
SHE SIGHS

06:26.080 --> 06:27.840
Now...

06:36.280 --> 06:38.040
Where is that note?

06:48.240 --> 06:49.640
Gwendoline? Mam'zelle!

06:49.640 --> 06:51.080
Vraiment! Qu'est-ce que tu fais?

06:51.080 --> 06:52.520
You're late for your report!

06:52.520 --> 06:54.200
Could I possibly swap with someone?

06:54.200 --> 06:55.880
I have an errand
I really need to run.

06:55.880 --> 06:59.000
No, no, no, no, no, no.
We are waiting. Allez. Allez, allez!

07:00.680 --> 07:02.480
Allez!

07:06.040 --> 07:07.600
Allez.

07:08.960 --> 07:10.800
Gwen, are you upset?

07:10.800 --> 07:13.160
Probably nervous for her report,
no doubt.

07:14.240 --> 07:16.400
Good luck. It won't be so bad.

07:19.760 --> 07:21.800
Oh, poor, Gwen!

07:21.800 --> 07:24.560
That's why she was unhappy.
She'll be late for the post.

07:25.520 --> 07:27.000
SHE SIGHS

07:27.000 --> 07:29.840
Someone did lend her the money.
What a brick!

07:30.920 --> 07:32.600
I just need an address.

07:32.600 --> 07:34.280
What are you doing?

07:34.280 --> 07:36.320
Gwen needs to send this to her mum.

07:36.320 --> 07:39.960
I'm doing poor Gwen a favour
and taking it to the post myself.

07:43.400 --> 07:46.880
You know, she doesn't deserve
your loyalty.

07:48.120 --> 07:52.000
Well, actually, I'm the only person
she calls her real friend.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.880
I feel sorry for her.
Her parents are horrid.

07:54.880 --> 07:57.920
But you're going to be late
for your report slot.

07:57.920 --> 08:00.080
Well, I'll take the cliff path.

08:00.080 --> 08:01.840
You know that's not safe alone.

08:01.840 --> 08:03.680
Those cliffs are dangerous!

08:03.680 --> 08:05.200
That's why it's not allowed.

08:05.200 --> 08:07.480
You'll get into lots of trouble
if they find out.

08:08.880 --> 08:10.120
Don't do it.

08:10.120 --> 08:11.520
Gwen's not worth it.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.960
Where's my parcel?

08:40.960 --> 08:43.800
Mary-Lou was talking about
taking it to the post office.

08:43.800 --> 08:46.200
Along the cliff path,
if you can believe that!

08:46.200 --> 08:48.880
She couldn't post it anyway,
I hadn't addressed it.

08:48.880 --> 08:52.000
She knew it was for your mother.
She addressed it for you.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.760
But she'd never get permission.

08:53.760 --> 08:57.040
Exactly. It's probably
in the postbox in the hall.

09:11.080 --> 09:12.600
GULLS CRY

09:32.960 --> 09:34.480
You asked to see me, Matron?

09:34.480 --> 09:36.240
Yes. As head of the second form,

09:36.240 --> 09:38.720
I need your help
with a very serious matter.

09:38.720 --> 09:40.480
There is a thief in the class.

09:40.480 --> 09:42.920
Don't worry, Matron,
we looked into that yesterday.

09:42.920 --> 09:44.520
It won't happen again.

09:44.520 --> 09:47.000
Yesterday?
What are you talking about?

09:47.000 --> 09:49.920
Money was taken from my charity tin
this morning!

09:49.920 --> 09:51.360
Are you sure?

09:51.360 --> 09:53.320
Yes, of course I'm sure, Miss Hope!

09:53.320 --> 09:54.640
It's a disgrace!

09:54.640 --> 09:59.080
So you need to find out who it is
and get that money back. Go on!

09:59.080 --> 10:01.200
Ah, do come in, Miss Grayling.

10:05.920 --> 10:07.480
Before I talk to her, Matron,

10:07.480 --> 10:09.800
please, take me through
exactly where and how

10:09.800 --> 10:11.720
you and Mr Parker found her
last night.

10:11.720 --> 10:15.320
Of course. Well, you should have
seen the state of her.

10:18.240 --> 10:20.000
GULLS CRY

10:20.000 --> 10:21.960
WAVES CRASH

10:28.360 --> 10:29.760
Mary-Lou.

10:30.760 --> 10:32.080
Mary-Lou!

10:43.520 --> 10:44.920
How are you feeling today, Ellen?

10:46.160 --> 10:47.960
A little better.

10:49.400 --> 10:50.960
Good.

10:52.360 --> 10:55.920
Matron explained you came to her
in a terrible state the other night

10:55.920 --> 10:59.200
with the same symptoms you had
the time before,

10:59.200 --> 11:00.960
the day of the class test.

11:04.120 --> 11:05.600
Can you describe how you felt?

11:07.400 --> 11:09.520
My chest went really tight.

11:10.880 --> 11:12.440
My head pounded.

11:14.720 --> 11:16.640
I-I panicked.

11:16.640 --> 11:19.320
I got pins and needles
in my hands, and...

11:20.400 --> 11:22.600
..I felt as if I was going to faint.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.640
Sounds like a further attack
of the nerves.

11:26.640 --> 11:29.920
It can happen sometimes,
before stressful events

11:29.920 --> 11:31.720
like tests and exams.

11:33.600 --> 11:35.080
But why yesterday?

11:37.800 --> 11:40.040
Miss Grayling, I've tried so hard!

11:42.800 --> 11:45.520
I'm not sure I'm the right sort
of girl for Malory Towers.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.400
Perhaps I shouldn't come back
next term.

11:53.720 --> 11:55.720
Why would you think that?

11:55.720 --> 11:59.240
Your teachers are very pleased
with you.

11:59.240 --> 12:03.200
It's not the teachers...it's
the girls!

12:06.840 --> 12:08.200
They think as I'm a thief.

12:09.600 --> 12:11.080
Goodness!

12:12.080 --> 12:13.480
Why would they think that?!

12:15.000 --> 12:18.400
All term, people's special things
have been going missing.

12:19.720 --> 12:22.240
And now Darrell has told the girls
that I stole them.

12:22.240 --> 12:24.280
Did you? No!

12:24.280 --> 12:26.720
Then why would Darrell come up with
a story like that?

12:30.720 --> 12:32.960
Miss Grayling,
I did a terrible thing!

12:38.280 --> 12:39.880
I sneaked out of bed.

12:41.400 --> 12:42.800
I-I...

12:44.040 --> 12:45.520
..I tried...

12:46.560 --> 12:50.320
..I tried to look at the questions
for the interschool quiz.

12:53.240 --> 12:54.640
I see.

12:55.680 --> 12:57.240
Darrell caught me.

12:57.240 --> 13:00.200
Alicia already accused me
of thieving

13:00.200 --> 13:02.600
and it looked like
everything she said was true!

13:04.520 --> 13:08.000
I was too ashamed to explain myself.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.640
Why did you try to cheat?

13:10.640 --> 13:13.000
Because I'm rotten at quizzes

13:13.000 --> 13:16.080
and everyone expects me
to be a clever scholarship girl.

13:21.720 --> 13:25.840
With everyone already so angry
with me,

13:25.840 --> 13:27.880
I couldn't mess the quiz up, too.

13:29.360 --> 13:31.760
And let them all down.
It would have been the last straw.

13:33.560 --> 13:36.680
Sounds like you put yourself
under an awful lot of pressure.

13:39.320 --> 13:42.320
But...cheating is wrong.

13:43.440 --> 13:45.440
I'm afraid this is a serious matter,
Ellen.

13:47.480 --> 13:49.520
I know. I've failed myself!

13:51.040 --> 13:52.360
And you, too.

13:55.680 --> 13:57.200
I don't know what to do!

13:58.240 --> 14:00.400
Oh, my head is pounding!

14:00.400 --> 14:01.840
Sh-sh-sh.

14:03.280 --> 14:06.240
It's all right. Breathe deeply.

14:07.360 --> 14:09.680
ELLEN BREATHES DEEPLY

14:09.680 --> 14:11.120
Good girl.

14:12.200 --> 14:13.960
That's better.

14:13.960 --> 14:17.640
Do you promise me you have not taken
any of the girls' belongings?

14:17.640 --> 14:19.200
Of course! I'm not a thief!

14:19.200 --> 14:21.880
Then I will help you clear your name
with your classmates.

14:23.080 --> 14:25.040
Are you ready to do that?

14:25.040 --> 14:26.440
How?

14:26.440 --> 14:29.800
You've admitted to trying to cheat
to me,

14:29.800 --> 14:33.120
now you need to find the courage
to tell the girls.

14:45.280 --> 14:46.840
GULLS CRY

15:15.640 --> 15:17.040
Argh!

15:21.200 --> 15:22.640
Oh, no!

15:27.360 --> 15:29.000
Oh, dear.

15:47.440 --> 15:49.040
Mary-Lou!

15:49.040 --> 15:50.840
SHE SIGHS

15:50.840 --> 15:52.680
Mary-Lou!

15:54.120 --> 15:56.840
Help! H-e-e-e-elp!

15:58.080 --> 16:01.480
Oh! Mary-Lou! Help! I'm here! Here!

16:04.080 --> 16:07.320
Mary-Lou! Oh, Gwen!
Oh, I'm so happy to see you help!

16:07.320 --> 16:08.800
Help! I can't hold on much longer!

16:08.800 --> 16:11.240
Gracious, Mary-Lou,
whatever happened?

16:11.240 --> 16:14.720
I tripped and your parcel went over,
but I've got it safe now!

16:25.000 --> 16:26.840
Gwen, I'm so sorry!

16:26.840 --> 16:28.800
It wasn't your fault.

16:28.800 --> 16:32.160
The only important thing now
is getting you to safety.

16:32.160 --> 16:33.720
Here, take my hand.

16:35.320 --> 16:38.160
MARY-LOU GRUNTS

16:38.160 --> 16:39.720
I can't reach!

16:41.080 --> 16:43.560
I'm going to have to run for help!
Gwen, don't leave me!

16:43.560 --> 16:47.200
I can't hold on much longer!
Gwen, please! Please!

16:47.200 --> 16:49.360
You have to.

16:49.360 --> 16:51.280
You have to!

16:51.280 --> 16:53.400
Gwen!

16:53.400 --> 16:55.320
Gwen!

16:55.320 --> 16:57.240
MARY-LOU SOBS

17:01.760 --> 17:04.240
You must be excited to see
your family again.

17:04.240 --> 17:06.560
Yes, definitely!

17:06.560 --> 17:08.920
Um...how do you do this packing
business?

17:08.920 --> 17:11.000
Oh, I just shove it in and hope,

17:11.000 --> 17:13.680
but try sitting on it
if it doesn't close.

17:13.680 --> 17:16.880
Where's Mary-Lou? She missed her
report slot. Mr Parker's furious.

17:16.880 --> 17:19.040
What? That's not like Mary-Lou.

17:19.040 --> 17:21.560
Er...Gwen was looking for her.
Maybe they're together?

17:21.560 --> 17:23.600
I haven't seen Gwen in an age
either.

17:23.600 --> 17:26.960
Mary-Lou was going over the
cliff path to post Gwen's parcel.

17:26.960 --> 17:28.280
No, she wouldn't.

17:28.280 --> 17:30.280
What if she did?!
Anything could have happened!

17:30.280 --> 17:32.040
If she did, she ought to be back
by now.

17:32.040 --> 17:34.320
You don't think Gwen
went after her, do you?

17:34.320 --> 17:37.080
Darrell, where are you going? To
find them. They may be in trouble.

17:37.080 --> 17:39.440
You'll be in trouble, too,
if you go after them.

17:39.440 --> 17:41.360
Tell Sally or one of the teachers.

17:41.360 --> 17:44.400
There's no time.
They may be in real danger.

17:44.400 --> 17:46.280
ALICIA SIGHS

17:46.280 --> 17:48.640
I think you're right, Alicia.
Honest to goodness,

17:48.640 --> 17:52.040
if Darrell isn't going to get
the teachers, we should.

18:03.920 --> 18:06.560
Mary-Lou, quick, hold this!

18:06.560 --> 18:08.440
Gwen, you came back!

18:08.440 --> 18:09.920
Loop this around your wrist!

18:11.960 --> 18:17.040
Well done! Then I'm going to
pull you up on three.

18:17.040 --> 18:21.320
One...two...three.

18:21.320 --> 18:23.520
Wait! Gwen, wait!
My hand's slipping.

18:23.520 --> 18:25.200
I can't do this!

18:25.200 --> 18:28.400
I think it's better to wait
for someone to find us.

18:28.400 --> 18:29.920
Does anyone know we're out here?

18:36.000 --> 18:38.080
This way, Sally.
There's someone I want you to see.

18:38.080 --> 18:40.800
Ah! Miss Grayling. Do you know
where Mary-Lou might be? She's...

18:40.800 --> 18:43.160
Ooh! Sorry! Mais, Alicia, attention!

18:43.160 --> 18:45.320
This is why it is forbidden
to run in the corridor!

18:45.320 --> 18:47.800
But it's an emergency.
Gwen and Mary-Lou have gone missing!

18:47.800 --> 18:50.200
What? We think they went over
the cliff path,

18:50.200 --> 18:51.840
but they should've been back
ages ago!

18:51.840 --> 18:53.080
They could be in real danger.

18:53.080 --> 18:54.840
Darrell went to find them, but...

18:54.840 --> 18:58.120
A second former is not enough
if something's gone wrong there!

18:58.120 --> 19:00.400
I'll call the Coastguard,
but they may be some way off.

19:00.400 --> 19:02.600
I'll go out there now.
There's no time to lose.

19:02.600 --> 19:04.200
You can't go alone. I'll come!

19:04.200 --> 19:06.240
Someone with medical training
is more useful.

19:06.240 --> 19:08.200
I'll go.
You stay here and keep order.

19:08.200 --> 19:10.480
Very sensible, Matron. Thank you.
Sorry, Sally.

19:10.480 --> 19:12.880
Please, make your own way
to the sanatorium.

19:12.880 --> 19:14.640
I trust you to resolve this alone.

19:37.320 --> 19:38.840
GULLS CRY

19:43.080 --> 19:44.440
Mary-Lou?

19:46.040 --> 19:48.880
Gwen? We're here!

19:48.880 --> 19:52.920
Help! Please!
It's Mary-Lou! Down here!

19:52.920 --> 19:54.960
Coming! Hold on,
I'll be right there!

19:54.960 --> 19:56.520
Mary-Lou! Gwen!

19:59.560 --> 20:01.320
Darrell, help! My hand's slipping!

20:01.320 --> 20:03.120
It's all right, I'll hold on, too,
Gwen.

20:03.120 --> 20:05.400
We'll keep Mary Lou safe
till help arrives!

20:06.640 --> 20:08.240
I did a very stupid thing.

20:08.240 --> 20:11.680
A wrong thing, but I'm not
the thief, I promise you!

20:11.680 --> 20:13.760
I never thought you were,
I swear it.

20:14.800 --> 20:16.440
I know you,
and you wouldn't do this.

20:18.560 --> 20:20.520
I just wish there was a way
to prove it.

20:23.680 --> 20:25.040
I think I have one!

20:26.240 --> 20:27.720
Sally, really?

20:31.640 --> 20:34.520
Mary-Lou, just keep on holding
tight, help will be here soon.

20:34.520 --> 20:37.280
How soon? I should have gone
for a teacher!

20:37.280 --> 20:39.440
Yes, you damn right should!

20:39.440 --> 20:40.800
Oh, Matron!

20:40.800 --> 20:43.960
I've never been more pleased
to see you in all my born days!

20:43.960 --> 20:47.000
What on earth possessed
you to endanger yourself like this?

20:47.000 --> 20:49.720
I'll take it from here, girls.
We'll get you all back safe.

20:49.720 --> 20:51.360
Praise be!

21:00.320 --> 21:02.280
Girls, thank heavens, you're safe!

21:02.280 --> 21:03.920
What were you doing?!

21:03.920 --> 21:05.800
I'm so sorry, Mr Grayling,
it's all my fault.

21:05.800 --> 21:07.120
I was trying to get to the post.

21:07.120 --> 21:10.720
Well, you're safe and sound, and
for now, that's all that matters.

21:10.720 --> 21:13.200
Straight up to the dorm
for a wash and a lie-down.

21:13.200 --> 21:14.600
Cook's already making cocoa.

21:16.080 --> 21:18.080
Were they on the cliff
like we thought?

21:18.080 --> 21:19.520
Hanging half off of it.

21:19.520 --> 21:22.160
Thank goodness you went out
after them!

21:22.160 --> 21:23.920
Thank goodness you got the teachers.

21:23.920 --> 21:25.880
I couldn't have brought them back
alone.

21:25.880 --> 21:27.120
I've been kicking myself.

21:27.120 --> 21:29.600
I didn't for a moment think she'd
go against the rules.

21:29.600 --> 21:31.760
Be so rash, or so brave.

21:31.760 --> 21:33.000
Lucky Gwen realised.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.920
Who'd have thought she'd be such
an incredible friend to Mary-Lou?

21:37.120 --> 21:39.200
Puts me to shame.

21:39.200 --> 21:42.400
I've not really been a great friend
to you this year, have I?

21:42.400 --> 21:44.960
Well, it has been a bit tricky
between us.

21:44.960 --> 21:46.680
I suppose when Betty left,

21:46.680 --> 21:48.520
I'd hoped you'd be
my one special friend.

21:48.520 --> 21:50.600
I can be close to more than
one person, you know.

21:50.600 --> 21:53.120
You'll always be my friend,
no matter what.

21:53.120 --> 21:54.560
Really?

21:56.160 --> 21:58.000
I know I didn't react
in the right way

21:58.000 --> 22:00.360
to you being best friends
with Sally,

22:00.360 --> 22:02.160
and to her becoming head of form.

22:04.240 --> 22:05.480
I'm sorry.

22:05.480 --> 22:07.480
Thanks for apologising.

22:08.920 --> 22:11.360
It's impossible to say cross
with you.

22:11.360 --> 22:12.640
You're always the best fun.

22:17.640 --> 22:19.200
GULLS CRY

22:20.240 --> 22:21.880
OWL HOOTS

22:23.960 --> 22:25.440
Gwen was an absolute heroine.

22:25.440 --> 22:28.080
She was gripping so hard,
her arms went numb. Huh!

22:29.200 --> 22:31.040
Ellen! Ellen?

22:31.040 --> 22:33.560
I thought you'd been expelled?

22:33.560 --> 22:35.680
I was ill, in the San.

22:35.680 --> 22:38.200
She's not the thief,
and we can prove it.

22:38.200 --> 22:41.960
Because there were still thefts
today whilst Ellen was in the San.

22:41.960 --> 22:43.600
What? What?

22:43.600 --> 22:46.480
Money went missing from Matron's
collection box this morning,

22:46.480 --> 22:48.760
right by our classroom.

22:48.760 --> 22:50.160
Ellen, I'm so sorry.

22:50.160 --> 22:52.640
It was utterly unacceptable
for me to accuse you like that.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.760
Please accept my apology.

22:55.760 --> 22:57.560
I was the first one to blame you.

22:57.560 --> 22:59.920
Sally, I should have listened
to you. I'm sorry.

22:59.920 --> 23:01.280
To the both of you.

23:01.280 --> 23:03.960
I believe we all owe Ellen
an apology,

23:03.960 --> 23:05.720
not just Darrell and Alicia.

23:05.720 --> 23:07.320
We all believed the worst.

23:07.320 --> 23:09.960
Sorry, Ellen. Apologies.

23:09.960 --> 23:12.040
Gosh, I'm so sorry, Ellen.

23:15.160 --> 23:17.920
I never believed the worst.
I always knew it wasn't you.

23:17.920 --> 23:20.240
She's right.
She always stood up for you.

23:21.800 --> 23:24.320
I'm so sorry you've been
put through this.

23:24.320 --> 23:27.120
There is still one question, though.

23:27.120 --> 23:29.880
If Ellen isn't the thief, who is?

23:31.680 --> 23:33.040
The truth is, it doesn't matter.

23:34.400 --> 23:36.240
we're all together.

23:36.240 --> 23:38.760
We're all safe. That's what counts.

23:38.760 --> 23:41.720
Now, please,
can we put this behind us?

23:41.720 --> 23:43.640
I'm sure there'll be no more thefts.

23:45.360 --> 23:47.440
And the culprit's learnt
their lesson.

23:47.440 --> 23:51.160
Gwen's right, and I think there's
something we're all forgetting.

23:52.400 --> 23:55.160
This might be our last night
ever here together.

23:55.160 --> 23:58.160
I don't want the school to close.
Nor do I.

23:58.160 --> 24:00.200
Today has been the most awful,

24:00.200 --> 24:02.760
and yet also,
the most wonderful day.

24:02.760 --> 24:05.360
I can't imagine a life
without you all.

24:05.360 --> 24:08.280
I can't imagine not being
at Malory Towers.
