00:43.503 --> 00:45.733
KAHN: Here you go. RSVP means...

00:45.839 --> 00:48.000
respondez-vous, <i>s'il</i> vous plaÎt,,,

00:48.108 --> 00:50.770
which in redneck means,
"pick up phone and call...

00:50.877 --> 00:54.005
"to give me head count for big
Laotian New Year's party."

00:55.448 --> 00:56.437
HANK: New Year's party?

00:56.549 --> 00:59.677
We're not falling
for a New Year's party in April, Kahn.

00:59.786 --> 01:01.947
We are not April fools.

01:02.255 --> 01:04.120
You are dumb as chimps.

01:04.491 --> 01:08.052
Laotians use lunar calendar,
so our New Year come in April.

01:08.261 --> 01:09.489
It's called Pimai.

01:09.596 --> 01:12.087
So, when do you pay your taxes? August?

01:13.199 --> 01:14.928
Okay. This real simple.

01:15.035 --> 01:17.765
You all come to my big Pimai party...

01:17.871 --> 01:20.738
get out of your stinking pig pens
for a night...

01:20.940 --> 01:23.875
see what it's like to live
in a Pottery Barn catalog.

01:25.845 --> 01:27.039
[Exclaiming incredulously]

01:27.147 --> 01:29.513
So, Kahn's party is for real.

01:30.417 --> 01:32.715
I'm gonna RSVP I'm not going.

01:32.819 --> 01:33.786
Nope.

01:33.987 --> 01:37.684
Je réponds non, Absolument non!

01:38.291 --> 01:39.280
[Slurping]

01:41.127 --> 01:44.961
I'm gonna make a Pimai resolution
to kiss you every day.

01:45.265 --> 01:47.358
And to get out more.

01:48.501 --> 01:50.662
KAHN: Kahn Jr!
CONNIE: I had better go.

01:50.837 --> 01:52.634
If my dad sees us together...

01:52.739 --> 01:55.606
Well, he thinks I'm collecting soil samples.

01:55.775 --> 01:59.006
Your dad's days of hating me
are coming to a close.

01:59.245 --> 02:01.645
Who can hate a kid who can Charleston?

02:02.315 --> 02:04.112
[Singing softly]

02:05.285 --> 02:06.252
CONNIE: [Laughing] Bye.

02:06.419 --> 02:08.545
Hank, we are going to that party.

02:08.722 --> 02:12.180
They are Connie's parents,
and it's not like there is a stream of girls...

02:12.292 --> 02:13.884
lining up to date Bobby.

02:13.993 --> 02:15.688
- There is one.
- Yeah.

02:15.795 --> 02:18.093
- Used to be none.
- Exactly.

02:18.298 --> 02:20.493
That is why we are going to do our part...

02:20.600 --> 02:23.330
and pretend that we like Kahn and Minh.

02:23.603 --> 02:26.128
Now, let's practice. I'll be Kahn.

02:26.339 --> 02:27.465
[Clearing throat]

02:27.574 --> 02:31.066
- [Imitating Kahn] You are a dumb redneck!
- That sounds more like Minh.

02:31.211 --> 02:34.203
Well, leave my wife out of this, hillbilly!

02:34.914 --> 02:36.677
I wish they'd move.

02:37.217 --> 02:39.481
I'm not wearing that to the Pimai party.

02:39.719 --> 02:42.153
I don't know why you buy clothes
for me online.

02:42.255 --> 02:43.688
Wassanasongs might come.

02:43.790 --> 02:46.759
Chane Wassanasong is
the biggest shank in our class.

02:46.860 --> 02:48.885
They very important family.

02:48.995 --> 02:52.123
Ted Wassanasong
member of Nine Rivers Country Club.

02:52.232 --> 02:53.199
KAHN: Hey!

02:53.466 --> 02:54.990
I just get big call.

02:55.101 --> 02:56.568
Ted Wassanasong?

02:57.337 --> 02:59.305
Yes. They're coming to our party...

02:59.405 --> 03:02.340
and Ted says they are
bringing along important monks.

03:02.542 --> 03:03.770
Buddhist monks?

03:03.877 --> 03:05.868
Yeah, Buddhist, whatever. Monks.

03:05.979 --> 03:08.345
- I'll get shrimp!
- Yeah, big shrimp!

03:08.481 --> 03:11.245
These monks are looking
for reborn spirit of some lama...

03:11.351 --> 03:13.512
name of Lama Sanglug.

03:13.753 --> 03:17.154
Lesser-known lama, but still
spiritual big shot, any way you slice it.

03:17.257 --> 03:19.657
They think he reincarnated <i>in this</i> area,

03:19.926 --> 03:23.555
They look all over McMaynerbury,
turn up squat.

03:23.863 --> 03:26.263
Ted says all signs point to Chane.

03:26.566 --> 03:30.468
You hear that, Connie?
Chane could be a lama, a great leader!

03:30.737 --> 03:33.638
What makes everybody so sure
that Chane is the lama?

03:33.773 --> 03:37.231
He's second oboist, runner-up
in Westinghouse Science Contest...

03:37.343 --> 03:39.334
and he has terrific posture.

03:39.479 --> 03:42.141
I'm first violin and a Westinghouse winner.

03:42.282 --> 03:44.341
How do you know I'm not the lama?

03:45.185 --> 03:46.709
[Exclaiming] Connie? A lama?

03:47.153 --> 03:49.144
That'd be amazing!

03:49.255 --> 03:53.191
Finally, stuffed-up jerk Ted Wassanasong
have to kiss my ass.

03:55.695 --> 03:57.219
[Chattering]

04:12.245 --> 04:13.405
[Slurping]

04:13.513 --> 04:15.037
- Hey, Hank.
- Bill.

04:15.248 --> 04:17.978
Happy Pimai!

04:18.517 --> 04:19.745
Damn it, Bill.

04:20.053 --> 04:22.544
- It's a Pimai custom.
- I'm in!

04:30.597 --> 04:32.895
Gentle Christian neighbor...

04:33.499 --> 04:36.093
as you might hear from
my daughter, Sanglug...

04:36.870 --> 04:40.704
I mean Connie. Where'd that come from?

04:41.074 --> 04:44.237
They throw water on you
to wash away the old year...

04:44.377 --> 04:46.208
and bring luck for the new.

04:46.579 --> 04:47.944
[Both grunting]

04:49.115 --> 04:50.377
BOBBY: Connie...

04:50.717 --> 04:53.049
I saw Chane trying to suck up
to the monks...

04:53.152 --> 04:54.915
by wrapping up a to-go plate.

04:55.021 --> 04:56.648
He is such a loser.

04:56.756 --> 05:00.692
Talk to the junior monk.
He likes oceanography.

05:01.227 --> 05:04.719
And who went to oceanography camp?

05:04.831 --> 05:05.820
Me.

05:06.266 --> 05:07.563
And Chane.

05:10.003 --> 05:12.198
Kahn, I found one of your Heinekens...

05:12.305 --> 05:15.138
sitting in back of one
of the crisper drawers. Can I have it?

05:15.308 --> 05:16.707
[Laughing awkwardly]

05:16.809 --> 05:18.868
That not my beer.

05:20.179 --> 05:21.612
I don't drink.

05:22.749 --> 05:25.081
BILL: Minh said it was yours.
KAHN: Take it.

05:27.220 --> 05:28.346
He village idiot...

05:28.454 --> 05:30.945
and in this village
that really saying something.

05:31.057 --> 05:34.254
And yet Connie, my daughter,
still read to him.

05:35.929 --> 05:37.829
Good luck trying to be a lama.

05:38.264 --> 05:40.494
You don't have to try to be a lama...

05:40.633 --> 05:42.760
you either are or you aren't.

05:42.902 --> 05:44.130
And I am.

05:44.437 --> 05:46.769
Why would a lama want to come back
as a third oboe?

05:46.873 --> 05:49.307
- Second, Connie.
- Any woodwind.

05:50.944 --> 05:54.471
...and when she little girl,
she name her goldfish Lama Sanglug.

05:54.881 --> 05:56.371
[All exclaiming softly]

05:56.683 --> 05:59.015
We would like to lay out some artifacts...

05:59.152 --> 06:02.986
for your daughter
and the Wassanasong boy to observe.

06:03.823 --> 06:08.453
If either child is the reincarnated lama,
they will choose correctly.

06:08.594 --> 06:10.858
Yeah, the test! I go get her.

06:11.698 --> 06:13.689
I need the keys to the Aerostar.

06:16.636 --> 06:19.400
Hey, a yard sale. How much for the bell?

06:19.505 --> 06:21.370
No. This is a test.

06:21.474 --> 06:25.570
One of these objects belonged
to our revered lama before he died.

06:25.979 --> 06:27.446
[Chanting]

06:27.547 --> 06:30.539
His reborn spirit
will recognize the object...

06:30.650 --> 06:31.878
and choose it.

06:32.652 --> 06:35.052
Let me try. How much is it? Dollar a play?

06:35.455 --> 06:37.150
[Exclaiming in exasperation]

06:40.393 --> 06:43.794
Okay, son, you the lama.

06:43.963 --> 06:46.431
Watch close. Every monk has a tell.

06:46.632 --> 06:49.066
Hurry, hurry. You gotta pick before Chane.

06:50.370 --> 06:51.337
HANK: Hi, there.

06:51.771 --> 06:54.535
It's great to see the kids enjoying
a good old...

06:55.375 --> 06:57.400
[Stuttering] Pi... ma... Pong party.

06:58.845 --> 07:01.313
Out of my way, you redneck. It's test time.

07:02.048 --> 07:03.913
Hey, Peggy does do a good you!

07:05.885 --> 07:07.819
[Bobby exclaims nervously]

07:08.021 --> 07:10.956

07:15.228 --> 07:16.195
Oh, no.

07:16.295 --> 07:17.694
BOBBY: I'll stall him.

07:18.865 --> 07:21.197
Hey, Chane! Who wants to move with me?

07:21.868 --> 07:24.496
[Singing popular ragtime tune]

07:31.911 --> 07:33.344
[Exclaiming in surprise]

07:33.446 --> 07:34.811
Bobby?

07:40.286 --> 07:44.279
No, please get up. I'm just a warm-up act.

07:46.092 --> 07:47.787
Here's Connie to take the test.

07:47.894 --> 07:49.953
Bobby, you just took the test.

07:52.498 --> 07:56.628
No, I didn't. Connie, here's your cane.

07:58.438 --> 08:00.497
You have selected correctly.

08:00.606 --> 08:03.871
That cane belonged to Sanglug.

08:04.043 --> 08:05.977
[Chanting softly]

08:06.779 --> 08:10.875
Bobby, we believe
you are a very special child.

08:11.217 --> 08:14.744
Sanglug was also joyful
and given to dance.

08:15.388 --> 08:18.255
You could be destined
to be a spiritual leader...

08:18.357 --> 08:21.554
as the reincarnation of Lama Sanglug.

08:21.661 --> 08:24.323
Okay, show's over. We're going home.

08:25.431 --> 08:28.889
This is all a big mistake.
You don't want me.

08:29.001 --> 08:30.059
No, Bobby.

08:30.403 --> 08:33.634
Today you passed a very important test.

08:34.039 --> 08:37.976
Our leader, the Rinpoche,
will come here next Sunday...

08:38.077 --> 08:40.307
to confirm our findings.

08:41.013 --> 08:41.980
Look here...

08:42.081 --> 08:45.710
I can't stop you from doing
what you do at the airports...

08:45.818 --> 08:49.413
but in my neighborhood
you'll stay away from my son.

08:49.522 --> 08:50.989
Thanks a lot, Bobby.

08:51.390 --> 08:53.449
But I didn't do anything.

08:53.626 --> 08:56.720
That guy in the dress is loco,

08:57.130 --> 09:01.294
That guy is a monk,
and that dress is a robe...

09:01.434 --> 09:03.766
and my religion is not a joke.

09:05.905 --> 09:08.373
They are not taking this very well.

09:08.908 --> 09:10.899
One of us should stay.

09:11.244 --> 09:13.712
[Whispering in foreign language]

09:17.483 --> 09:20.714
What? Come on!

09:20.953 --> 09:23.444
I'm not sleeping in that van another night.

09:23.856 --> 09:25.915
We are blessed to be in a town...

09:26.025 --> 09:29.017
with a most generous Buddhist family.

09:29.862 --> 09:34.458
Oh, good. Company.
Blow up the air mattress.

09:35.568 --> 09:37.092
[Peggy laughing]

09:37.803 --> 09:40.533
And they thought it was gonna be Connie.

09:40.740 --> 09:44.232
Well, I always knew
my Bobby was destined for greatness.

09:45.111 --> 09:47.477
To be perfectly honest, didn't see lama.

09:48.147 --> 09:52.709
[Sighing] The Buddhists think Bobby
is a holy man. That's just sad.

09:53.252 --> 09:57.586
Hank, listen to this.
Richard Gere is a Buddhist!

09:58.658 --> 10:00.216
Just keeps getting sadder.

10:03.863 --> 10:06.058
Is this what you dragged me out here for?

10:06.165 --> 10:08.531
Soft-serve ice cream at the student union?

10:08.634 --> 10:11.194
That was an unscheduled detour.

10:13.673 --> 10:16.733
The campus Buddhist club
is the main attraction.

10:18.077 --> 10:21.706
BOBBY: Don't tell anyone I'm a lama.
I want to blend in.

10:23.983 --> 10:25.507
[Peaceful instrumental music]

10:25.618 --> 10:29.918
This act symbolizes when the Buddha
left his palace to become a monk...

10:30.289 --> 10:32.883
and cut off his long hair with a sword.

10:33.926 --> 10:36.121
My parents don't go to things like this.

10:36.229 --> 10:38.493
There's no one here they want to meet.

10:38.698 --> 10:40.256
[All chanting]

10:40.366 --> 10:43.961
- Thanks for bringing me, Bobby.
- Thank you for the ice-cream cone.

10:45.171 --> 10:48.004
A real lama wouldn't be thinking
of Supercuts jokes...

10:48.107 --> 10:50.098
in the middle of the ceremony, right?

10:50.209 --> 10:53.007
Lama Sanglug always said
that the funniest joke...

10:53.179 --> 10:55.306
comes from the tedium of meditation.

10:55.748 --> 10:57.773
He was a wonderfully funny man.

10:58.351 --> 11:00.649
He often wore his begging bowl like a hat.

11:00.753 --> 11:03.187
I do that with my cereal bowl!

11:04.257 --> 11:07.886
There are some teachings
that I think may help you on your journey.

11:08.694 --> 11:09.854
[Exclaims excitedly]

11:09.962 --> 11:11.088
Cool!

11:14.100 --> 11:15.362
BOBBY: No pictures?

11:17.903 --> 11:19.200
Maybe this will help.

11:22.942 --> 11:24.842
[Grunting and groaning]

11:25.544 --> 11:28.604
DALE: Let go of my finger.
BILL: You let go of my beer.

11:28.714 --> 11:31.740
So help me, Bill,
don't mess with my trigger finger!

11:31.851 --> 11:34.149
What are you going to do?
Shoot me with my beer?

11:34.253 --> 11:35.584
I don't think so.

11:35.755 --> 11:37.450
Why are friends fighting?

11:37.590 --> 11:40.787
- He put his finger in my beer.
- He dared me to.

11:41.060 --> 11:44.860
You fight, but you both
have the same goal, right?

11:45.498 --> 11:46.465
- So?
- So?

11:46.666 --> 11:47.997
Mr. Gribble...

11:48.167 --> 11:51.227
I want you to relax,
and imagine your finger...

11:51.337 --> 11:54.363
sliding right out of Mr. Dauterive's beer.

11:54.874 --> 11:59.106
That is the single most ridiculous thing
I have ever...

11:59.545 --> 12:01.240
[Exclaiming in disbelief]

12:01.447 --> 12:03.574
[Oriental instrumental music]

12:04.750 --> 12:07.241
CONNIE: Chane Wassanasong
could never have done that.

12:07.653 --> 12:09.120
BOBBY: Chane's a good guy.

12:18.631 --> 12:20.030
[Hank exclaims in shock]

12:20.499 --> 12:22.558
[Chanting]

12:23.969 --> 12:27.461
No way! No God-dang way!

12:29.108 --> 12:32.373
Dad, I was this close to enlightenment.

12:33.245 --> 12:36.476
You can call putting paint on your head
anything you want...

12:36.582 --> 12:39.676
but we're Christians,
and we don't do that kind of stuff.

12:39.819 --> 12:42.686
Why do you think we go to church
every Sunday? For fun?

12:42.788 --> 12:46.087
- Why do we go?
- Because we're Methodist.

12:46.292 --> 12:48.260
Yeah, I've been meaning to ask you:

12:48.361 --> 12:50.556
What is Methodism, anyway?

12:53.399 --> 12:56.459
REVEREND: Methodism is a rejection
of Calvinism.

12:56.569 --> 12:58.560
[Exclaiming knowingly]

12:59.071 --> 13:02.734
So, Bobby, you heard her.
You can't be a lama.

13:02.875 --> 13:04.137
[Exclaiming excitedly]

13:04.243 --> 13:06.871
You're the boy! Congratulations.

13:06.979 --> 13:08.276
Now, hold on.

13:08.514 --> 13:10.982
Wait, we're supposed to be
on the same team here.

13:11.083 --> 13:12.641
Of course we are.

13:12.752 --> 13:14.811
Bobby, do you love Jesus?

13:14.920 --> 13:17.445
- With all my heart.
- Buddhist liar.

13:17.590 --> 13:21.185
Mr. Hill, I would prefer it if Bobby
were simply a devout Methodist...

13:21.293 --> 13:25.093
but if he can use this experience
to connect to his spirituality sincerely...

13:25.197 --> 13:27.358
Yeah, okay. We're running late.

13:27.500 --> 13:28.865
Reverend, I'll see you Sunday.

13:28.968 --> 13:32.404
We could use an extra heart at the
homeless prayer service Saturday.

13:32.505 --> 13:34.405
I'll mention it to the missus.

13:35.841 --> 13:37.308
BOBBY: Listen to the wind.

13:37.777 --> 13:41.269
Let the wind take the <i>world</i> away,

13:41.480 --> 13:43.812
What do you hear inside, Connie?

13:43.983 --> 13:48.283
I just hear my dad's ignorance
and my mom's empty-headed materialism.

13:48.687 --> 13:50.518
No, wait.

13:50.823 --> 13:53.758
I hear my dad's
empty-headed materialism, too...

13:54.326 --> 13:55.793
and that's the loudest.

13:55.895 --> 13:58.056
You expect too much of them, Connie.

13:58.364 --> 14:01.595
Sometimes you have to let things be
as they are.

14:02.168 --> 14:04.068
So your parents don't like me.

14:04.837 --> 14:06.896
I'm carrying a few extra pounds.

14:07.606 --> 14:10.473
Easy for you to say. You're a lama.

14:10.576 --> 14:11.873
[Shushing]

14:11.977 --> 14:15.276
I'm teaching here. Listen with your heart.

14:15.548 --> 14:19.314
The beating of it
will drown out everything else.

14:19.618 --> 14:23.611
All that's left will be the sound of us.

14:24.190 --> 14:25.919
Kiss me, Sanglug.

14:26.025 --> 14:28.152
[Soft instrumental music]

14:32.998 --> 14:36.764
"My child is an honor student
at Westview Elementary."

14:39.038 --> 14:40.869
[Car engine revving]

14:41.140 --> 14:45.270
Yeah? Well, my child is God
to billions of Asians!

14:45.678 --> 14:47.168
[Tires screeching]

14:51.116 --> 14:53.812
I noticed that you couldn't stop
looking over at me.

14:53.919 --> 14:57.082
I kept hearing flats.
I assumed they were coming from you.

14:57.189 --> 14:59.157
Now, come on, you two.

14:59.391 --> 15:02.588
If one of you plays flats
and the other plays sharps...

15:02.695 --> 15:04.754
we will have perfect harmony.

15:04.897 --> 15:07.422
That doesn't even make sense, nitwit.

15:07.533 --> 15:11.367
Shut up. You're just jealous
because you weren't chosen as lama.

15:11.971 --> 15:13.905
I'm glad I'm not a lama.

15:14.106 --> 15:17.098
The Chane train stops for the ladies.

15:17.309 --> 15:18.776
What is that supposed to mean?

15:18.878 --> 15:22.678
Lamas can't have wives.
They can't even have girlfriends.

15:24.917 --> 15:27.385
Is that true, Bobby?

15:27.486 --> 15:28.646
It can't be.

15:28.954 --> 15:32.321
I mean, how do they get new lamas
if the lamas can't...

15:33.125 --> 15:34.456
Oh, no.

15:35.160 --> 15:36.718
Reincarnation.

15:37.997 --> 15:39.897
[Gasping in horror]

15:45.538 --> 15:47.938
I got it. I'm leaving the Buddhahood.

15:48.240 --> 15:50.105
Bobby, I won't let you.

15:50.910 --> 15:54.209
I want to be with you, too,
but it's not our choice.

15:54.580 --> 15:58.107
If you're Sanglug, you're Sanglug.
It's meant to be.

15:58.317 --> 16:03.084
I can always tank the test.
I'll pick a bell. Who owns a bell?

16:03.389 --> 16:06.950
- What if it is the bell?
- I'll pick another cane.

16:07.092 --> 16:08.992
They wouldn't make it
the same thing twice.

16:09.094 --> 16:10.959
Don't make this a game.

16:11.130 --> 16:13.030
If you don't take that test tomorrow...

16:13.132 --> 16:16.499
I'm going to be wondering
for the rest of my life if you're a lama.

16:16.602 --> 16:19.969
And if you are,
I'll be disrespecting Buddha every day.

16:20.472 --> 16:22.064
I can't live with that.

16:24.243 --> 16:25.335
[Slurping]

16:26.345 --> 16:29.212
- How long you been celibate?
- Three years.

16:30.583 --> 16:32.574
The fourth year's the tough one.

16:35.821 --> 16:38.813
You go tell my boy he's not a lama. Now.

16:38.991 --> 16:41.789
I can't tell him that,
because it's not up to me.

16:41.894 --> 16:43.361
There's a Buddhist saying:

16:43.462 --> 16:46.295
"As the wheel follows the ox
that draws the cart...

16:46.465 --> 16:49.093
"the wind cannot overturn a mountain."

16:49.702 --> 16:52.535
You're talking like a song
from The Lion King,

16:52.705 --> 16:54.798
Stop that. It makes no sense.

16:54.907 --> 16:57.808
- Or does it make perfect sense?
- What the...

16:58.277 --> 17:01.678
See, that's the type of...
I'm gonna kick your ass.

17:01.847 --> 17:05.510
If my ass is going to be kicked,
then it will be kicked.

17:05.617 --> 17:06.585
What...

17:07.152 --> 17:08.847
[Exclaims in frustration]

17:11.290 --> 17:13.622
To the celibacy of monks.

17:13.726 --> 17:15.660
The celibacy of monks.

17:22.401 --> 17:25.700
There, there, Kahn Jr.
We know how you must feel.

17:25.804 --> 17:28.898
But really, you just dodged
a chubby white bullet.

17:29.008 --> 17:31.238
[Soft instrumental music]

17:35.814 --> 17:38.112
[Chanting]

17:41.954 --> 17:42.943
[Sighing]

17:43.055 --> 17:45.216
I don't know what the heck I'm doing.

17:45.324 --> 17:49.021
Lama Sanglug, I miss Connie so much.

17:49.628 --> 17:52.597
Wait, I'm Lama Sanglug.

17:53.632 --> 17:56.157
What should we do? Give us a sign.

17:56.635 --> 17:59.399
HANK: [In ghostly voice]
I am the great Lama Sanglug.

17:59.972 --> 18:01.405
And you are not,

18:01.874 --> 18:04.638
Forget about that dang Buddhist hooey,

18:04.910 --> 18:06.844
<i>I command you,</i>

18:08.180 --> 18:09.738
Dad, what are you doing?

18:10.449 --> 18:13.907
Nothing, I was just walking by
and I thought I heard...

18:14.019 --> 18:15.179
[Exclaims wearily]

18:15.287 --> 18:17.778
- Don't take the test tomorrow.
- I have to.

18:17.890 --> 18:21.053
- What have they got on you, boy?
- I'm in a jam here.

18:21.293 --> 18:24.990
Connie says she'll have to dump me
if I don't take the test.

18:26.198 --> 18:28.325
[Sighing] Well, we definitely
can't have that.

18:28.434 --> 18:30.629
That's why I'm praying my guts out.

18:30.936 --> 18:32.836
But I'm not getting an answer.

18:33.739 --> 18:35.673
I don't know what to do.

18:37.209 --> 18:38.608
Everything is gonna...

18:39.044 --> 18:41.137
It's gonna be all right.

18:42.247 --> 18:45.011
So just hang in there.

18:48.821 --> 18:49.879
Okay, then.

18:53.192 --> 18:54.750
Don't forget to brush.

19:03.368 --> 19:05.199
Okay, here we go.

19:05.604 --> 19:08.573
Lord, Hank Hill here, Methodist.

19:09.274 --> 19:12.072
Sorry about missing
the homeless prayer service.

19:12.578 --> 19:14.068
Now, about Bobby...

19:14.179 --> 19:18.377
I'm pretty sure we're on the same page
about this lama thing.

19:18.884 --> 19:22.718
I was kind of hoping that you could
just have him fail this test tomorrow.

19:22.821 --> 19:27.019
You know, like you've had him fail
so many other tests in the past.

19:28.193 --> 19:31.060
Oh, and the starving kids.

19:31.497 --> 19:32.896
Gotta go. Amen.

19:34.800 --> 19:37.667
[Serene instrumental music]

19:45.644 --> 19:47.271
[Birds chirping]

20:01.527 --> 20:03.290
Hey, Bobby Hill, look.

20:03.529 --> 20:07.488
I got a statue of Buddha.
Separated at birth, or what!

20:10.836 --> 20:13.304
[Tense instrumental music]

20:15.841 --> 20:20.175
If he picks right,
he gets to keep all those prizes.

20:20.846 --> 20:23.815
- What if he picks wrong?
- Cap snaffler.

20:24.283 --> 20:27.116
Snaffles caps off all size jugs,
bottles, and jars...

20:27.219 --> 20:29.119
and it really works.

20:32.024 --> 20:33.787
This is the final test.

20:34.326 --> 20:35.293
Please...

20:35.561 --> 20:37.756
choose an item you see on this rug.

20:37.896 --> 20:39.488
[Sighing]

20:44.837 --> 20:47.465
[Tense instrumental music continues]

21:01.186 --> 21:04.019
I can pick anything I see on this rug?

21:04.323 --> 21:05.290
Yes.

21:05.891 --> 21:07.119
I pick Connie.

21:07.326 --> 21:09.351
Right there in the mirror.

21:09.461 --> 21:10.689
[Connie exclaims in shock]

21:10.796 --> 21:12.730
Hey, make him pick for real. He cheating.

21:12.831 --> 21:14.196
There is no cheating.

21:14.299 --> 21:16.995
The test has been taken. He has chosen.

21:19.938 --> 21:21.872
[Screaming]

21:23.342 --> 21:25.640
Do you think maybe I should pick?

21:26.645 --> 21:27.612
No.

21:29.081 --> 21:31.549
[Serene instrumental music]

21:37.489 --> 21:38.717
Pack it up.

21:38.824 --> 21:41.884
- But that was Sanglug's mirror.
- I know.

21:42.127 --> 21:45.187
- But he didn't pick it.
- But he used it.

21:45.297 --> 21:46.525
[Exclaiming affirmatively]

21:46.632 --> 21:47.724
Tough call.

21:48.467 --> 21:50.264
MONK 1: But it's mine, and I made it.

21:57.042 --> 21:58.669
[Theme music]

22:27.372 --> 22:29.602
