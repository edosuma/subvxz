WEBVTT

00:07.173 --> 00:08.826
WOMAN: Are you gonna help me out here?

00:08.869 --> 00:10.565
Feels like I'm eating
the whole thing.

00:10.608 --> 00:12.130
I'm helping.

00:12.173 --> 00:13.565
Mm-hmm.

00:13.608 --> 00:15.217
And it's your turn.

00:15.260 --> 00:17.652
Do you love me...

00:17.695 --> 00:19.956
more than your truck?

00:20.000 --> 00:22.173
Tough one.

00:22.217 --> 00:23.130
But heck, yeah, I do.

00:23.173 --> 00:24.956
[chuckles]

00:25.000 --> 00:27.739
Do you love me more
than your dog?

00:27.782 --> 00:30.826
Now that's not fair.
I love my Betty.

00:30.869 --> 00:32.956
I love my truck.

00:33.000 --> 00:37.043
Then I guess
I love you both equally.

00:37.086 --> 00:39.565
In very different ways,
of course.

00:39.608 --> 00:41.347
[coughing]

00:41.391 --> 00:42.608
You okay?

00:42.652 --> 00:44.086
[coughs]

00:44.130 --> 00:45.913
I'm so sorry.

00:45.956 --> 00:49.130
Why are you sorry? It's...

00:49.173 --> 00:51.434
it's a ring.

00:51.478 --> 00:53.565
It was my grandmother's.

00:55.173 --> 00:56.869
Too soon?

00:56.913 --> 00:58.869
By years.

00:58.913 --> 01:01.000
This is our 11th date.

01:01.043 --> 01:02.913
You haven't even met my parents.

01:02.956 --> 01:06.956
Well, guess this couldn't
have gone any worse.

01:07.913 --> 01:09.739
Look out!

01:20.347 --> 01:22.347
[gasps]

01:24.217 --> 01:25.217
[gasps]

02:00.826 --> 02:02.565
BISHOP:
Morning, men.

02:02.608 --> 02:04.565
Wow. Look at these early birds!

02:04.608 --> 02:06.173
Oh, if it isn't

02:06.217 --> 02:07.739
Jake the snake, who...

02:07.782 --> 02:10.260
takes the cake, never
wakes and bakes and...

02:10.304 --> 02:11.260
I haven't had

02:11.304 --> 02:12.347
my coffee yet.

02:12.391 --> 02:13.565
To what do we owe
the pleasure?

02:13.608 --> 02:14.913
Jake and I decided
to carpool.

02:14.956 --> 02:16.217
And it's been a while,
so I thought

02:16.260 --> 02:18.000
I'd pop in, say
hi to the gang.

02:18.043 --> 02:20.304
Oh... the gang.Oh... the gang.

02:20.347 --> 02:22.391
Yeah. Why?
Is that weird?

02:22.434 --> 02:25.521
No. I mean, maybe.
But... it's okay.

02:25.565 --> 02:27.173
Unfortunately, your, uh,

02:27.217 --> 02:30.260
BFF has yet to join
the gang this morning.

02:30.304 --> 02:32.695
Oh. They really
call us that?You thought I was kidding?

02:32.739 --> 02:35.347
Look, guys, um, maybe
Gibbs and I are starting

02:35.391 --> 02:38.304
to become buddies, kind of,
but, uh, when I say "the gang,"

02:38.347 --> 02:40.391
I mean all of you-- I mean
Jimmy, Ducky, uh, Abby.

02:40.434 --> 02:42.043
Ev... All of you.

02:42.086 --> 02:43.652
We're just messing
with you, Jake.

02:43.695 --> 02:45.173
[chuckles]
Mostly.

02:45.217 --> 02:47.130
To be honest with you,
we're not even remotely

02:47.173 --> 02:49.608
accustomed to anyone
getting close to Gibbs.

02:49.652 --> 02:51.739
Well, I'd-I'd hardly
say we're close.

02:51.782 --> 02:54.086
None of our phone conversations
last more than a few minutes.

02:54.130 --> 02:56.565
Phone conversations?Like on the phone?

02:56.608 --> 02:59.086
Mmm. They talk
almost daily.

02:59.130 --> 03:01.043
Again, very brief
conversations.

03:01.086 --> 03:02.695
TONY: Still, it sounds
like you buddies

03:02.739 --> 03:05.521
are getting...
b-b-b-buddier.

03:05.565 --> 03:07.695
Maybe a second covert operation
in the works?

03:07.739 --> 03:10.043
Funny, I don't remember
the first.

03:10.086 --> 03:12.695
Uh, not covert, boss.
I meant the thing

03:12.739 --> 03:15.130
with the-the Russian intel,
when you and...

03:15.173 --> 03:16.782
you and Fornell were
at the, uh, cabin.

03:16.826 --> 03:17.956
I'm...

03:18.000 --> 03:19.782
I haven't had
my coffee yet either.

03:19.826 --> 03:21.434
Uh, Gibbs.
Uh, glad I caught you.

03:21.478 --> 03:22.695
I was gonna get Ellie
to return this,

03:22.739 --> 03:24.695
but, uh...BISHOP: Yeah, it really did

03:24.739 --> 03:26.695
the trick on our bedroom door.
Silly thing kept

03:26.739 --> 03:29.347
swelling and jamming
and sticking.Mm-hmm.

03:29.391 --> 03:32.347
So many setups to so many
jokes I can't say out loud.Mmm.

03:32.391 --> 03:35.000
No joke. Got a dead Navy officer
in Franconia.

03:35.043 --> 03:36.000
Come on. Let's go.

03:36.043 --> 03:38.043
Then I'll get to work, too.

03:38.086 --> 03:40.000
What about the rest of the gang?

03:40.043 --> 03:42.043
Yeah. Don't you want to say hi
to Ducky and Abby and Jimmy?

03:42.086 --> 03:43.565
Well, I-I imagine
they're busy, too.

03:43.608 --> 03:46.000
I'll catch them
another time.

03:46.043 --> 03:47.043
I'm sure they'll understand.

03:50.782 --> 03:55.304
Victim is Navy Ensign
Janine Wilt, 25 years old.

03:55.347 --> 03:57.304
Crash occurred
just after midnight.

03:57.347 --> 03:58.913
Miraculously,
no witnesses were injured.

03:58.956 --> 04:01.347
Can't say the same for her.

04:01.391 --> 04:03.173
She had to be going awfully fast
to jump the curb

04:03.217 --> 04:04.826
and smash through this place.

04:04.869 --> 04:07.217
Yeah, but her wound is hardly
from the crash.

04:07.260 --> 04:09.130
Her throat's been cut.

04:09.173 --> 04:12.000
Severed the carotid artery.

04:12.043 --> 04:14.130
The poor girl tried
to stem the flow

04:14.173 --> 04:15.391
with her free hand...

04:15.434 --> 04:18.260
but likely bled out
in a minute or two.

04:18.304 --> 04:19.956
There's a hospital not far
from here.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.913
She was probably trying
to get there before she...

04:21.956 --> 04:24.043
McGee, you got an address
for her?

04:24.086 --> 04:26.000
Yeah, that's about
all I've got, boss.

04:26.043 --> 04:28.043
License has her
living in Fairfax,

04:28.086 --> 04:32.043
but the Navy database has pretty
much everything else classified.

04:33.086 --> 04:34.521
Classified?

04:34.565 --> 04:37.391
Keep digging.
DiNozzo.

04:37.434 --> 04:39.913
Yeah. I got a gym bag
in the backseat here.

04:39.956 --> 04:42.391
Sweaty clothes and a cell phone.

04:42.434 --> 04:45.173
No calls in or out
since mid-afternoon yesterday.

04:45.217 --> 04:48.173
Why didn't she call 911
from wherever she was slashed?

04:48.217 --> 04:51.304
I rather doubt anyone would be
thinking clearly when

04:51.347 --> 04:54.043
rapidly bleeding to death,
Mr. Palmer.

04:54.086 --> 04:56.956
"Wherever she was slashed."
That's the question.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.521
No GPS to locate the
starting point of the car.

04:59.565 --> 05:01.347
Boss-- "Gorton Poly Proud."

05:01.391 --> 05:03.739
Oh, Gorton Poly High School.

05:03.782 --> 05:04.913
That's all the way
over in Arlington.

05:04.956 --> 05:06.913
It's about 12 miles from here.

05:06.956 --> 05:09.000
It's in a whole other direction
from where she lived.

05:09.043 --> 05:11.695
DiNozzo, McGee, finish up here.
Bishop, come on.

05:11.739 --> 05:13.695
You're with me.

05:19.391 --> 05:22.347
Principal said to bring these
people to you, Coach Curry.

05:22.391 --> 05:25.043
Thanks, Brad. Get back to class.

05:25.086 --> 05:27.608
What can I do for you?

05:27.652 --> 05:28.913
NCIS.

05:28.956 --> 05:29.913
I'm Special Agent Bishop,

05:29.956 --> 05:31.913
this is Special
Agent Gibbs.

05:31.956 --> 05:33.565
Navy Ensign Janine Wilt.

05:33.608 --> 05:35.652
We understand she works for you.

05:35.695 --> 05:39.391
Volunteers, yeah. We coach
the girls basketball team.

05:39.434 --> 05:42.086
Why? Is she okay?

05:45.000 --> 05:47.347
[voice breaking]:
This can't be.

05:47.391 --> 05:49.434
Janine was just here
last night.

05:49.478 --> 05:52.956
Was it a robbery?
Like a-a carjacking?

05:53.000 --> 05:55.043
What time last night?

05:55.086 --> 05:58.434
Uh, practice ended at 9:00.

05:58.478 --> 06:02.913
She stayed after to work out,
while I graded report cards.

06:02.956 --> 06:05.043
Left a little before me,
11:00 or so?

06:05.086 --> 06:07.000
You see her leave?

06:08.130 --> 06:12.173
She threw me a big wave
when she drove off.

06:12.217 --> 06:14.043
Any idea where she was headed?

06:14.086 --> 06:16.043
Home, I assume.

06:16.086 --> 06:17.173
Was she in a relationship?

06:17.217 --> 06:20.086
No. I mean,
not that I'm aware of.

06:20.130 --> 06:23.956
Between this and her Navy job,
I doubt she could find the time.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.043
And what was her Navy job?

06:26.086 --> 06:27.956
You'd know better than I would.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.565
She was always very private
about that.

06:30.608 --> 06:32.782
Something to do with computers.

06:32.826 --> 06:35.043
GIRLS:
Dragons!

06:35.086 --> 06:38.000
What am I gonna tell the girls?

06:38.043 --> 06:40.000
Janine was
more than a coach.

06:40.043 --> 06:41.608
She was a friend.

06:41.652 --> 06:44.695
Do they really need to hear
that she was murdered?

06:44.739 --> 06:46.869
Until we know more,
maybe just...

06:46.913 --> 06:49.000
tell them
about the car accident.

06:51.695 --> 06:55.000
So basically we have a lost hour
between the time

06:55.043 --> 06:57.608
Ensign Wilt left here
and then crashed her car.

06:57.652 --> 06:59.869
Check street surveillance--
any stops she made--

06:59.913 --> 07:01.956
stores, traffic lights,
hitchhikers.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.173
[phone rings]

07:04.217 --> 07:06.608
Yeah, McGee.
What do you have?

07:06.652 --> 07:09.043
Uh, dug up a little more, boss.
Actually, a lot more.

07:09.086 --> 07:11.043
Turns out Ensign Wilt
was working

07:11.086 --> 07:13.130
as a Cyber Warfare Engineer

07:13.173 --> 07:14.826
with the Office
of Naval Intelligence.

07:14.869 --> 07:16.173
Pretty young for that detail.

07:16.217 --> 07:18.521
Yeah, well, that explains
the classified status.

07:18.565 --> 07:20.043
Well, that's
the "a lot more" part.

07:20.086 --> 07:22.217
Her personnel file went dark
not two weeks ago.

07:22.260 --> 07:24.043
Kind of makes you wonder.

07:24.086 --> 07:26.043
Wonder what
she was working on.

07:26.086 --> 07:28.695
Maybe it got her killed.

07:37.043 --> 07:39.565
Got any daughters,
Director Vance?

07:39.608 --> 07:42.043
I do. I have one.I have three.

07:42.086 --> 07:44.695
If any one of them grows up
to be like Ensign Wilt,

07:44.739 --> 07:46.956
I'll be
one proud papa.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.739
Just a special kid,
in every way.

07:50.782 --> 07:54.086
A kid with a very heady position
at ONI, Captain.

07:54.130 --> 07:55.652
She earned it.

07:55.695 --> 07:56.956
Smart,

07:57.000 --> 07:58.739
squared away, and a knack
for computer analysis

07:58.782 --> 08:01.086
and code-breaking
like I've never seen.

08:01.130 --> 08:02.608
Please.

08:02.652 --> 08:04.826
She had far greater access
to code-word operations

08:04.869 --> 08:07.826
than a lot of our more
experienced hands.

08:07.869 --> 08:09.782
Her file just went dark
two weeks ago.

08:09.826 --> 08:11.391
What was she
working on?

08:11.434 --> 08:13.826
Espada de Satanás.

08:13.869 --> 08:15.826
"Sword of Satan."

08:15.869 --> 08:17.739
Colombian drug ring
moving product

08:17.782 --> 08:19.565
through our ports for years.

08:19.608 --> 08:21.913
That is, until Ensign Wilt
successfully hacked

08:21.956 --> 08:25.391
their Dark Web server and
deciphered their communications.

08:25.434 --> 08:27.869
So is there a chance
that her murder was retribution?

08:27.913 --> 08:30.782
Absolutely not.
We had a joint task force

08:30.826 --> 08:32.956
round up every known member
of the ring.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.913
Every knownmember.

08:34.956 --> 08:36.739
We got them all, Agent Gibbs.

08:36.782 --> 08:40.608
Besides, Wilt's covered status
was enough to protect her.

08:40.652 --> 08:43.086
Not enough to keep us
from tracing her to you.

08:43.130 --> 08:44.434
Gibbs...

08:44.478 --> 08:45.956
If Wilt did track down
the cartel,

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
it's not a large stretch
to think that they

08:48.043 --> 08:49.652
would've tracked her back.

08:53.347 --> 08:56.043
Is it, Cap'n?

08:56.086 --> 08:58.739
It is kind of interesting if
we really break it down, right?

08:58.782 --> 09:00.739
Right.'Cause, I mean,
there's the age disparity...

09:00.782 --> 09:02.913
Hey, Bish, quick question.
The BFFs.

09:02.956 --> 09:04.913
Are they on the phone
every day?

09:04.956 --> 09:06.260
Are we still on that?

09:06.304 --> 09:08.043
Well, he is.It's not...

09:08.086 --> 09:09.260
every day, Tony.

09:09.304 --> 09:10.913
See? What did
I tell you?

09:10.956 --> 09:12.173
Most Tuesdays

09:12.217 --> 09:14.173
or Thursdays, they just meet
for racquetball.

09:14.217 --> 09:15.869
GIBBS:
Okay, let's have it.

09:15.913 --> 09:17.130
Any luck on the car?

09:17.173 --> 09:19.391
BISHOP: Nothing yet.
The thing about traffic cams

09:19.434 --> 09:21.782
is they only take a picture
when you do something wrong.

09:21.826 --> 09:23.608
We went to the apartment.
No sign of foul play.

09:23.652 --> 09:25.739
Uh, we did bring
her laptop.

09:25.782 --> 09:27.043
I tried opening it there,
but this thing is

09:27.086 --> 09:28.782
a virtual Fort
Knox of firewalls

09:28.826 --> 09:29.956
and security codes.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.869
Run it by Abby.Well, she's tied up

09:31.913 --> 09:33.826
trying to get Ensign
Wilt's car into evidence,

09:33.869 --> 09:35.826
so I called
Cyber Operations

09:35.869 --> 09:37.869
and they have their
best agent on the way now.

09:37.913 --> 09:39.652
I don't know about best, McGee,

09:39.695 --> 09:40.739
but I'm
working on it.

09:40.782 --> 09:42.217
Special Agent Dorneget.

09:42.260 --> 09:44.043
Reporting for duty,
Agent Gibbs.

09:44.086 --> 09:45.956
How's it going, Tony,

09:46.000 --> 09:48.173
McGee...

09:48.217 --> 09:49.869
you?

09:49.913 --> 09:51.956
Bishop.Ah, of course.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.739
I've seen you
around campus. Ned.

09:53.782 --> 09:55.913
TONY:
Look at the Dorney,
all grown up.

09:55.956 --> 09:58.826
Accelerated past probie
to special agent,

09:58.869 --> 10:01.000
graduated to Cyber.

10:01.043 --> 10:02.782
What can I say?
My mom was wrong.

10:02.826 --> 10:05.000
All those years of playing Xbox
finally paid off.

10:05.043 --> 10:06.913
Ah, good.

10:06.956 --> 10:08.782
See if you can make this
pay off, Dorney. Come here.

10:09.782 --> 10:11.739
McGEE:
Oh, and, Dorney, I'm here

10:11.782 --> 10:12.956
if you need help.
Just...

10:13.000 --> 10:14.130
[computer chimes]

10:17.956 --> 10:18.695
Uh-oh.

10:18.739 --> 10:20.043
GIBBS:
Yeah, wuh-oh.

10:20.086 --> 10:21.565
You're gonna be busy, Tim.

10:21.608 --> 10:22.956
What is it, McGee?

10:25.086 --> 10:27.043
It's a whole bunch of
secured e-mails from ONI.

10:27.086 --> 10:29.565
Subject: Ensign Wilt.

10:29.608 --> 10:32.000
It's intel on a drug ring
she helped take down.

10:32.043 --> 10:34.000
Split it up with DiNozzo,
see what's there.

10:34.043 --> 10:35.695
You thinking revenge, boss?

10:35.739 --> 10:38.608
No, I'm thinking
"see what's there."

10:40.826 --> 10:42.826
[grunts]

10:48.217 --> 10:51.173
Rather quiet today, Doctor.
Everything okay?

10:51.217 --> 10:54.086
Yes, I'm enjoying
the silence.

10:54.130 --> 10:56.608
It is nice.

10:56.652 --> 10:57.869
It's different.

10:57.913 --> 10:59.173
We've been at this a while,

10:59.217 --> 11:01.043
and not one
Jack the Ripper comment

11:01.086 --> 11:03.260
or Isadora Duncan comparison...

11:03.304 --> 11:05.826
I'm not a... jukebox,
Mr. Palmer.

11:05.869 --> 11:07.956
Nor do I take requests.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.086
And as to Isadora Duncan,
she was strangled

11:11.130 --> 11:15.000
by her scarf, which got tangled
in the rear axle of a car.

11:15.043 --> 11:16.826
There is no comparison.

11:16.869 --> 11:18.782
What do we have, Duck?

11:18.826 --> 11:21.739
Cause of death confirmed.

11:21.782 --> 11:22.826
A single wound

11:22.869 --> 11:23.826
to the ensign's carotid artery

11:23.869 --> 11:24.956
with a wide blade.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.782
What do you mean "wide"?

11:26.826 --> 11:28.913
Well, see for yourself.

11:28.956 --> 11:29.956
It's not a clean
razor cut,

11:30.000 --> 11:32.695
but, uh, rather sloppy.

11:32.739 --> 11:34.826
The skin around
the incision

11:34.869 --> 11:37.956
is pulled and torn.I'll take
your word for it.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.826
Another point of interest,
Agent Gibbs,

11:39.869 --> 11:42.130
are the nicks and abrasions
above and below the wound.

11:42.173 --> 11:43.782
DUCKY: The killer likely
held the weapon

11:43.826 --> 11:45.043
against the ensign's throat

11:45.086 --> 11:47.869
before delivering
the final slice.

11:47.913 --> 11:49.130
What are those?

11:49.173 --> 11:50.869
JIMMY:
Neck tissue samples.

11:50.913 --> 11:52.130
If any residue was left behind,

11:52.173 --> 11:53.782
it may help
in identifying the weapon.

11:53.826 --> 11:56.782
I was just about
to take it over to Abby.

11:56.826 --> 11:58.869
And still you are here?

12:01.000 --> 12:02.869
Palmer.

12:03.826 --> 12:05.173
Thank you.

12:08.043 --> 12:10.826
ABBY: Whywouldn't Gibbs
thank you, Jimmy?

12:10.869 --> 12:12.043
He thanks us all the time.

12:12.086 --> 12:14.217
No, he always thanks you.

12:14.260 --> 12:16.826
Well, maybe it's just the first
time you actually heard it.

12:16.869 --> 12:20.043
Maybe. Oh, that makes
me feel appreciated.

12:20.086 --> 12:22.043
Well, gratitude
has a way of doing that.

12:22.086 --> 12:25.173
Gibbs likes me!
He really likes me!

12:25.217 --> 12:26.782
[laughs]

12:26.826 --> 12:28.391
That's Sally Field.

12:28.434 --> 12:29.826
I really, really like you,
too, Jimmy,

12:29.869 --> 12:31.913
and I would really like it
if you would take

12:31.956 --> 12:33.043
those tissue samples upstairs

12:33.086 --> 12:34.869
and put them
in the fridge in my lab.

12:34.913 --> 12:36.695
'Cause I have to focus
on this car.

12:36.739 --> 12:38.869
Hope you can figure
out where it's been.

12:39.913 --> 12:42.173
Okay, little deuce coupe...

12:42.217 --> 12:44.869
show me what you got.

12:44.913 --> 12:46.956
Where is Dorneget?

12:47.000 --> 12:49.086
I don't know. We looked up
a minute ago and he was gone.

12:49.130 --> 12:51.826
Gibbs, I found Wilt's car--
running a red light

12:51.869 --> 12:54.956
on Route 7 in Falls Church
at 11:42 p.m.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.869
No other vehicles
on the road, luckily.

12:56.913 --> 12:59.217
Can't see the interior.It's a bad shot, I know.

12:59.260 --> 13:00.826
But... she couldn't
have been stabbed yet.

13:00.869 --> 13:02.347
I mean, both hands
on the wheel.

13:02.391 --> 13:03.956
And this is
a full 20 minutes

13:04.000 --> 13:05.782
before she crashed
into the pie shop.

13:05.826 --> 13:08.739
She wasin a hurry.Let's do this.

13:08.782 --> 13:10.217
At last,
a kindred spirit.

13:10.260 --> 13:12.217
Just fueling up for battle.

13:12.260 --> 13:14.913
Talk about peeling the onion--
I've never seen this level

13:14.956 --> 13:16.391
of security
on a personal computer.

13:16.434 --> 13:19.739
Even for a techie, this
Ensign Wilt was pretty paranoid.

13:19.782 --> 13:21.956
Or afraid of this guy.

13:22.000 --> 13:25.782
Alfredo Montez-- he's
a paroled drug trafficker...

13:25.826 --> 13:28.782
[wry laugh] turned "legitimate"
computer consultant.

13:28.826 --> 13:30.565
What is this?

13:30.608 --> 13:32.260
Well, his main client
was the drug ring.

13:32.304 --> 13:33.826
He created
a secure online network

13:33.869 --> 13:35.521
and messaging system for them.

13:35.565 --> 13:37.000
Not so secure after all.

13:37.043 --> 13:39.130
Not after Ensign Wilt
cracked it.

13:39.173 --> 13:40.130
Maybe he traced her back.
That many aliases,

13:40.173 --> 13:41.652
he could be hiding
in plain sight.

13:45.130 --> 13:47.608
I'll take
the first three.I'll take the next three.

13:48.652 --> 13:51.260
Count me in.
Winner buys dinner.

14:02.913 --> 14:04.652
TONY: Well,
hey there, Alfredo.

14:04.695 --> 14:06.913
Looks like you turned in
your prison jumpsuit, huh?

14:09.434 --> 14:10.608
NCIS! Don't move.

14:11.608 --> 14:12.347
Hey!

14:17.434 --> 14:19.000
Just go ahead.

14:19.043 --> 14:21.739
Just kill me!
Just get it over with.

14:22.913 --> 14:24.521
And why would
we do that?

14:24.565 --> 14:25.565
TONY:
Alfredo...

14:25.608 --> 14:28.130
we're NCIS.

14:28.173 --> 14:31.130
So, like, Feds can't be bought?

14:31.173 --> 14:33.869
[quietly]: That's not
really our style.

14:33.913 --> 14:36.478
You're not gonna kill me?

14:47.695 --> 14:50.000
Your boss says you were off
last night, Alfredo.

14:50.043 --> 14:51.217
Or is it...

14:51.260 --> 14:52.608
Alfonso?

14:52.652 --> 14:54.173
Isn't that the name
you go by now?

14:54.217 --> 14:57.652
And you can't tell us
where you were?

14:59.565 --> 15:01.782
Alfredo.What? I was home.

15:03.217 --> 15:06.043
Yeah, just now,
where were you?

15:06.086 --> 15:09.739
Thinking how relieved
I was that you guys
are legit NCIS.

15:09.782 --> 15:13.173
I thought Espada De Satanás
had sent you.

15:13.217 --> 15:14.521
You thought she
was a hit man?

15:14.565 --> 15:15.608
Hey.

15:15.652 --> 15:17.000
I've been
going crazy.

15:17.043 --> 15:18.608
Hiding out...

15:18.652 --> 15:20.956
laying low ever since
the man hacked the system

15:21.000 --> 15:22.782
that I built for the Colombians.

15:22.826 --> 15:24.304
"The man"?

15:24.347 --> 15:26.913
I swore to them
it was hack-proof.

15:26.956 --> 15:29.956
Then one of your damn white hats
backdoors my server

15:30.000 --> 15:32.652
with a Trojan,
click-jacks my message chain,

15:32.695 --> 15:35.086
and then I got owned
without even knowing it.

15:35.130 --> 15:36.956
Yeah, I hate it
when that happens.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.217
So, you don't
specifically know

15:39.260 --> 15:42.086
whobackdoored your server?[chuckles]

15:42.130 --> 15:45.347
It was you.
The man. Federales. Pues...

15:47.000 --> 15:50.173
And not the individual hacker?

15:50.217 --> 15:52.956
Whoever it is,
he's no Script-Kiddie,

15:53.000 --> 15:55.043
I can tell you that.

15:55.086 --> 15:57.347
[sighs]

15:57.391 --> 15:59.608
Last known cartel member,

15:59.652 --> 16:02.347
but I'm not so sure
that he's our killer.

16:04.086 --> 16:06.304
ABBY [over phone]: Gibbs,
Gibbs, Gibbs, Gibbs, Gibbs.

16:06.347 --> 16:08.782
GIBBS:
What do you got, Abbs?

16:08.826 --> 16:11.043
Ensign Wilt was not
in this car alone.

16:11.086 --> 16:12.434
How do you know that?

16:12.478 --> 16:14.826
It's hard to see...

16:14.869 --> 16:17.695
but there is a glove print
on this handle

16:17.739 --> 16:19.869
that has our girl's
blood on it.

16:19.913 --> 16:22.739
She ran a red light
with a knife to her throat.

16:22.782 --> 16:25.869
Got any idea
when he got in there?As far as we know,

16:25.913 --> 16:28.913
the sadistic creep
could have been hiding
back here the whole time,

16:28.956 --> 16:31.304
till he decided
to finish her off
and jump out.

16:31.347 --> 16:33.347
What you're collecting's
gonna tell us who it is?

16:33.391 --> 16:35.086
Well, Major Mass Spec's
gonna tell us.

16:35.130 --> 16:36.391
Meanwhile, I've got
some neck tissue

16:36.434 --> 16:38.434
in my fridge I need
to get started on.

16:38.478 --> 16:41.086
[phone rings]Oh, yeah, hits just
keep on coming.

16:41.130 --> 16:43.521
Yeah, McGee.

16:47.434 --> 16:49.565
Hey, Dorny, you need a towel
or a fan over there?

16:49.608 --> 16:52.043
You try navigating this
gauntlet, Timmy boy.

16:52.086 --> 16:54.217
Feels like I just spent hours
running through catacombs

16:54.260 --> 16:56.913
to kill a dragon priest,
only to step outside and have

16:56.956 --> 16:59.434
another dragon land
right on my head.

16:59.478 --> 17:01.260
McGEE:
It's an obscure

17:01.304 --> 17:03.956
Skyrim reference, boss--
it actually makes perfect sense.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.217
Thank you, Elf Lord.

17:05.956 --> 17:07.000
What did you find,

17:07.043 --> 17:08.869
Dragon Priest?

17:08.913 --> 17:11.652
It may be nothing,
but it seems Ensign Wilt

17:11.695 --> 17:13.608
gained remote access
from this laptop

17:13.652 --> 17:15.173
to a home computer

17:15.217 --> 17:16.565
in Annandale
two nights ago.

17:16.608 --> 17:18.086
I sent McGee
the IP address.

17:18.130 --> 17:20.043
I got a name here.

17:20.086 --> 17:23.478
Adem Faruk Korkmaz.

17:23.521 --> 17:24.739
Listed as a
businessman.

17:24.782 --> 17:26.739
Appears to run it
out of his home.

17:26.782 --> 17:29.695
Our girl was poking
around his hard drive
for a half an hour.

17:29.739 --> 17:31.521
Yeah? Doing what?

17:31.565 --> 17:33.173
Only his computer
can tell us that.

17:37.869 --> 17:39.434
Hi.

17:39.478 --> 17:42.000
We're wondering if there is
an Adem Korkmaz home?

17:42.043 --> 17:43.826
Oh. Sure.

17:43.869 --> 17:44.826
[loudly]:
Dad!

17:44.869 --> 17:47.434
It's for you!

17:47.478 --> 17:49.043
He'll be right down.

17:50.086 --> 17:51.304
ADEM:
Who is it, Layna?

17:51.347 --> 17:52.913
LAYNA:
I don't know.

17:52.956 --> 17:54.565
Mr. Korkmaz.

17:54.608 --> 17:57.521
NCIS. We're here
to ask you some questions

17:57.565 --> 18:00.478
regarding some information
linked to your home computer.

18:00.521 --> 18:02.391
Uh, it is a...

18:02.434 --> 18:05.130
it is a business computer.
What about it?

18:05.173 --> 18:07.434
More specifically,
it's about remote access to it

18:07.478 --> 18:08.565
obtained by...

18:08.608 --> 18:09.565
this woman,

18:09.608 --> 18:11.347
Ensign Janine Wilt.

18:11.391 --> 18:12.869
Never saw her before.

18:12.913 --> 18:15.347
And no one has access
to my computer but me.

18:15.391 --> 18:16.956
It's for
business only.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.304
Right. We-we got that.

18:18.347 --> 18:19.608
But you think
maybe it's possible

18:19.652 --> 18:21.434
she could have gotten in
without your knowledge?

18:21.478 --> 18:23.608
No. No, it's quite secure,

18:23.652 --> 18:26.000
and I would know
if someone were tampering.

18:26.043 --> 18:27.391
Well, you would know even better

18:27.434 --> 18:29.086
if you'd let us take
a quick look.

18:29.130 --> 18:31.478
Do you have a warrant?

18:31.521 --> 18:33.565
Mr. Korkmaz,
if it makes any difference,

18:33.608 --> 18:35.391
we're pursuing a murder case.

18:35.434 --> 18:36.869
Ensign Wilt's murder.

18:38.956 --> 18:40.434
I'm sorry.

18:40.478 --> 18:43.869
But I assure you
I don't know this woman,

18:43.913 --> 18:46.652
and she certainly had
no access to my computer.

18:46.695 --> 18:48.000
Mr. Korkmaz...And...

18:48.043 --> 18:49.478
if you don't have a warrant,

18:49.521 --> 18:52.000
there is nothing else
to discuss here.

18:53.913 --> 18:56.521
Nothing suspicious about that.

18:56.565 --> 18:59.000
Let's get that warrant.

18:59.043 --> 19:01.652
Okay, let's hear it-- who is
this guy, what's his business,

19:01.695 --> 19:04.608
what's he hiding?Adem Faruk Korkmaz.

19:04.652 --> 19:07.260
46. Immigrated from
Istanbul in '98.

19:07.304 --> 19:08.608
Granted U.S. citizenship

19:08.652 --> 19:09.956
in '03.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.130
Founded Korkmaz,
an import-export
business in '05.

19:12.173 --> 19:14.826
Importing, exporting,
shipping and receiving, huh?

19:14.869 --> 19:16.304
Possible cartel connection?

19:16.347 --> 19:18.086
Korkmaz Apparel Imports

19:18.130 --> 19:20.739
has been cited twice since '05
for late taxes,

19:20.782 --> 19:22.521
but otherwise,
no criminal record.

19:22.565 --> 19:24.217
And no warrant.

19:24.260 --> 19:25.956
Judge denied
the warrant

19:26.000 --> 19:27.521
on Korkmaz's computer--
he cited jurisdiction

19:27.565 --> 19:29.217
from another agency.

19:29.260 --> 19:30.565
What other agency?

19:30.608 --> 19:32.173
Details are classified.

19:32.217 --> 19:34.434
Classified?Popular word
on this case.

19:34.478 --> 19:36.434
Classified, McGee?
By who?

19:36.478 --> 19:37.782
Take your pick
of agencies, boss.

19:37.826 --> 19:39.913
I mean, it could be FBI,
DEA, Homeland...

19:39.956 --> 19:41.739
NSA.

19:41.782 --> 19:43.043
I just got
called from one

19:43.086 --> 19:44.956
of their people
asking us to back off.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.434
They hold a FISA warrant

19:46.478 --> 19:48.391
to monitor
Korkmaz's dealings with Turkey.

19:48.434 --> 19:50.956
Who was it that called,
Director?Doesn't matter.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.391
What matters is,
NSA Director Conte

19:52.434 --> 19:54.217
is on a red-eye to Geneva.

19:54.260 --> 19:56.043
I will call her
in the morning.
So in the meantime,

19:56.086 --> 19:58.608
I suggest that we
all get some rest.

19:58.652 --> 20:00.652
Forget resting.

20:05.913 --> 20:07.391
Hey.

20:07.434 --> 20:09.782
Long day.
Did you eat yet?

20:09.826 --> 20:13.217
What's NSA's interest
in Adem Korkmaz?

20:13.260 --> 20:15.304
I know you know.

20:16.565 --> 20:18.086
[sighs]

20:21.434 --> 20:23.347
[sighs]

20:23.391 --> 20:26.913
You know better than to
ask me about NSA affairs.

20:26.956 --> 20:29.173
Yet here we are.

20:29.217 --> 20:31.826
We used to talk
about this stuff all the time.

20:31.869 --> 20:34.391
The operative words
there: "used to."

20:34.434 --> 20:37.130
Why are you guys monitoring him?

20:37.173 --> 20:40.086
Like I know specifics.

20:40.130 --> 20:42.782
You're the agency's
lead attorney.And how many

20:42.826 --> 20:45.434
foreign-born businessmen
has NSA followed since 9/11?

20:45.478 --> 20:47.478
Thousands. Millions.

20:47.521 --> 20:49.521
And for a million
and one reasons.

20:49.565 --> 20:51.521
We don't care about millions.

20:51.565 --> 20:55.173
We care about Korkmaz's computer
and its possible connection

20:55.217 --> 20:58.304
to the murder
of a young Navy officer.

20:59.608 --> 21:00.956
[sighs]

21:01.000 --> 21:03.608
And... what happened there?

21:03.652 --> 21:05.217
Well, if NSA wasn't interfering,

21:05.260 --> 21:08.478
I might know the answer
to that, Jake.We're not interfering.

21:08.521 --> 21:09.521
Just maintaining
jurisdiction on a case

21:09.565 --> 21:12.043
that's been ours
for months, years.

21:12.086 --> 21:13.521
Years?

21:13.565 --> 21:15.304
What, you think
this is personal?
Like we suddenly

21:15.347 --> 21:17.000
decided to block you
guys for no reason?

21:17.043 --> 21:19.695
Well, the call Vance
just got was pretty sudden.

21:19.739 --> 21:21.782
Okay, look, no, stop.

21:21.826 --> 21:24.217
You're asking me
to betray my agency.

21:24.260 --> 21:26.304
No, I'm asking for your help.

21:26.347 --> 21:29.130
In a way you never
would have dreamed of before.

21:29.173 --> 21:31.782
Something's changed
here, Ellie.

21:31.826 --> 21:32.956
Something's different.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.173
You're different.

21:34.217 --> 21:36.695
Yeah, everything is different!

21:41.956 --> 21:44.304
I shot a man in Kabul
last week.

21:46.869 --> 21:50.130
I killed him.

21:50.173 --> 21:52.043
[sighs]

21:52.086 --> 21:54.217
Has a way of changing a person.

21:54.260 --> 21:56.086
Wait.

21:56.130 --> 21:58.304
What?!

21:58.347 --> 22:00.173
You...

22:00.217 --> 22:01.869
You didn't tell me.

22:01.913 --> 22:04.043
Why would I?

22:04.086 --> 22:07.304
We don't tell each other
anything anymore.

22:07.347 --> 22:09.304
But...

22:09.347 --> 22:11.739
how, Ellie?

22:11.782 --> 22:14.173
What happened?

22:15.173 --> 22:17.826
It was him or me.

22:20.260 --> 22:22.478
And...

22:22.521 --> 22:25.782
as long as I keep
reminding myself of that,

22:25.826 --> 22:29.478
I can also keep pretending
that I'm fine.

22:29.521 --> 22:33.043
You should have told me.

22:33.086 --> 22:35.478
I could have helped.

22:35.521 --> 22:38.260
Then help me now.

22:38.304 --> 22:41.434
Let go of Korkmaz's computer.

22:41.478 --> 22:45.043
We need it.

22:45.086 --> 22:47.782
Please?

22:49.043 --> 22:51.130
I can't. No.

22:51.173 --> 22:53.260
I'm sorry.

22:54.521 --> 22:58.826
Look, Ellie, you chose to
leave NSA and take this job.

22:58.869 --> 23:00.739
No one pushed you.

23:00.782 --> 23:02.391
I know.

23:02.434 --> 23:04.913
And it's changed
things between us.

23:05.869 --> 23:08.000
But we can work it out.

23:08.043 --> 23:10.608
Right?

23:10.652 --> 23:13.000
[sighs]

23:20.391 --> 23:22.565
[laughter]

23:22.608 --> 23:24.739
That's hilarious, right?

23:24.782 --> 23:26.521
Hey.
Who's the early bird now?

23:26.565 --> 23:28.608
Did you take
the carpool again?

23:32.086 --> 23:34.130
Uh, that beltway
can be murder, you know.

23:34.173 --> 23:36.434
Carpool lane was

23:36.478 --> 23:38.173
flying, though,
wasn't it, McGee?

23:38.217 --> 23:39.608
Oh, yeah, it was flying.

23:39.652 --> 23:41.956
Gentlemen, morning.
TONY:
Oh.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
Hey, Jake.

23:56.347 --> 23:57.173
Sit.

24:08.521 --> 24:10.608
I do hate to put you
in this position,

24:10.652 --> 24:12.913
especially with your wife
being an agent.

24:12.956 --> 24:15.739
My wife's job's beside
the point, Director,

24:15.782 --> 24:18.217
and this position is my job.

24:18.260 --> 24:21.043
It's what I do.
Then there's
what wedo.

24:21.086 --> 24:23.695
And the only thing I haven't
been letting you do, Gibbs,

24:23.739 --> 24:25.608
is override NSA jurisdiction,

24:25.652 --> 24:28.130
and we're under no legal
obligation to explain why.

24:28.173 --> 24:30.434
You want my opinion?
Your job sucks.

24:31.565 --> 24:33.347
Gibbs...The longer we go

24:33.391 --> 24:35.608
before checking
Korkmaz's computer,

24:35.652 --> 24:38.565
the better chance we have
a killer gets away.

24:39.608 --> 24:42.782
Okay, then, go ahead.

24:42.826 --> 24:44.913
NSA surrenders access.

24:46.347 --> 24:48.217
Excuse me, did you just say...?

24:48.260 --> 24:49.608
I'll clear it upstairs.

24:49.652 --> 24:52.043
Any repercussions,

24:52.086 --> 24:53.608
I'll take the hit.

24:53.652 --> 24:56.739
Well, you heard the man, Gibbs.
Go get your warrant.

24:56.782 --> 24:59.565
Actually, let me
save you a step.

25:01.565 --> 25:02.826
Is this what I think it is?

25:04.347 --> 25:07.782
I have no idea.

25:13.739 --> 25:15.652
This is like a nightmare.

25:15.695 --> 25:17.565
You have no right
to search my data.

25:17.608 --> 25:19.217
What are you afraid
we're gonna find?

25:19.260 --> 25:21.521
I make my living
on that machine.

25:21.565 --> 25:24.739
If your people corrupt my files,
it could ruin my business.

25:24.782 --> 25:26.478
Oh, you need to relax.

25:26.521 --> 25:27.913
Our computer techs
are very careful.

25:27.956 --> 25:31.000
They're very,
um... discreet.

25:31.043 --> 25:33.521
[sighs]
NED:
Holy guacamole, look at all

25:33.565 --> 25:35.000
the business he does
through Turkey.

25:35.043 --> 25:36.652
Nothing through Colombia?

25:36.695 --> 25:39.000
Not unless Istanbul
is code for Bogota.

25:39.043 --> 25:40.608
Wait.

25:40.652 --> 25:41.913
Where are you getting this?

25:41.956 --> 25:43.565
I don't see
Korkmaz's computer.

25:43.608 --> 25:44.826
Don't need it.

25:44.869 --> 25:46.739
We're using the SSD drive
Gibbs gave us.

25:46.782 --> 25:50.260
And where did he get that?

25:50.304 --> 25:51.913
We didn't ask, Bishop,
and neither should you.

25:51.956 --> 25:55.913
Okay.
So, what's it telling us?

25:55.956 --> 25:58.782
Telling us that Korkmaz
is shipping and receiving

25:58.826 --> 26:00.608
a whole lot of designer clothes
and accessories.

26:00.652 --> 26:02.739
And he's making a
boatload doing it,

26:02.782 --> 26:04.608
but it all seems
legitimate.

26:04.652 --> 26:05.782
Uh, Dorney, need your help here.

26:05.826 --> 26:07.260
I got folders that won't open.

26:07.304 --> 26:09.000
I got it.

26:10.782 --> 26:12.565
Interesting.

26:12.608 --> 26:14.826
They're both protected
by the same firewalls

26:14.869 --> 26:16.695
Ensign Wilt used
on her laptop.

26:16.739 --> 26:18.565
We'll consider that
her signature.

26:18.608 --> 26:20.652
Any way to see
what's in them?

26:20.695 --> 26:22.521
I've conquered this dungeon
before,

26:22.565 --> 26:24.695
but this time,
I have dragon arrows.

26:24.739 --> 26:27.565
Skyrim.Okay, one folder's

26:27.608 --> 26:28.956
empty, but it held
an e-mail account

26:29.000 --> 26:30.695
that's been deleted.

26:30.739 --> 26:31.521
What's in the other one?

26:31.565 --> 26:33.695
A link to a chat room,

26:33.739 --> 26:36.260
but no access.

26:36.304 --> 26:38.565
All that's left is
a list of screen names.

26:38.608 --> 26:42.652
Let's print 'em.
Print everything.

26:42.695 --> 26:44.826
[sighs] Well, how much
longer must I wait?

26:44.869 --> 26:48.000
Until we know
what's on your computer.

26:48.043 --> 26:49.695
But you're free
to go any time.

26:49.739 --> 26:52.173
No worries. When we find
something, we'll come get you.

26:53.869 --> 26:55.130
We found something.

26:55.173 --> 26:56.217
Ooh.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.043
Hey, have a seat.

27:00.086 --> 27:02.130
Uh...

27:02.173 --> 27:03.869
O-Okay, you must believe me,

27:03.913 --> 27:06.608
I had no idea
they were knockoffs.

27:06.652 --> 27:08.260
My distributor assured me

27:08.304 --> 27:10.869
that these were genuine
designer bags,

27:10.913 --> 27:13.739
and when I figured out
that they were fakes,

27:13.782 --> 27:16.043
the demand was
too great to stop.

27:16.086 --> 27:18.695
I could have lost my house.

27:18.739 --> 27:22.347
This what NSA
was monitoring?

27:22.391 --> 27:23.956
NSA?

27:24.000 --> 27:26.086
Well, they had to be suspecting
a little bit more than this.

27:26.130 --> 27:29.565
That's not at all
what I have here.

27:29.608 --> 27:30.695
What is it?

27:30.739 --> 27:32.695
A deleted e-mail account

27:32.739 --> 27:34.869
and a chat room
that's been blocked.

27:34.913 --> 27:37.739
Y-You found this
on-on my computer?

27:39.478 --> 27:41.565
You hardly seem
like the chat-room type.

27:41.608 --> 27:44.086
I'm not.
I've never seen this.

27:44.130 --> 27:46.608
Any of those screen names
ring a bell?

27:46.652 --> 27:48.739
I mean, of course not. I...

27:48.782 --> 27:51.565
Just it...
it makes no sense. I...

27:57.260 --> 27:58.913
"Scout99"?

27:58.956 --> 28:01.173
That mean something?

28:02.608 --> 28:05.043
Your daughter.

28:05.086 --> 28:08.043
She was born in '99.

28:08.086 --> 28:10.869
That Mockingbirdbook
is her favorite.

28:10.913 --> 28:13.260
And she uses your computer?

28:13.304 --> 28:17.086
No, she's forbidden.
She-she knows better...

28:17.130 --> 28:20.608
Gorton Poly High--
that where she goes to school?

28:22.608 --> 28:24.739
She play basketball?

28:24.782 --> 28:26.043
How do you know this?

28:26.086 --> 28:27.260
Wait...

28:27.304 --> 28:29.608
How...?

28:29.652 --> 28:33.043
Our school tablet is
unbelievably restricted.

28:33.086 --> 28:35.695
No private e-mail,
no social media.

28:35.739 --> 28:39.347
You snuck onto Dad's computer.

28:39.391 --> 28:41.086
Tell them
everything, Layna.

28:41.130 --> 28:42.869
We'll discuss it later.

28:44.695 --> 28:46.826
Secret e-mail account?
Chat rooms?

28:46.869 --> 28:49.347
Just one chat room...
at first.

28:49.391 --> 28:51.217
It was fun talking
with other kids

28:51.260 --> 28:52.956
around the country,
the world even.

28:53.000 --> 28:54.652
At first?

28:54.695 --> 28:56.652
Until things got creepy.

28:56.695 --> 28:58.608
I got talked into joining
this other chat room.

28:58.652 --> 29:01.652
Only nobody there was
talking movies or music.

29:01.695 --> 29:03.260
What were they talking about?

29:03.304 --> 29:05.739
Bunch of haters
complaining about life.

29:05.782 --> 29:07.782
Everybody and everything.

29:07.826 --> 29:11.565
Asking if I was lonely,
and did I know my calling.

29:11.608 --> 29:13.130
What's your calling?

29:13.173 --> 29:14.652
I-I don't know.

29:14.695 --> 29:16.826
They talked
about that a lot.

29:16.869 --> 29:18.956
About who I was
and did my life have meaning?

29:19.000 --> 29:20.347
So I quit.

29:20.391 --> 29:22.652
Both chat rooms.

29:22.695 --> 29:25.695
That's when the weird messages
started coming.

29:25.739 --> 29:26.913
Messages from who?

29:26.956 --> 29:28.739
The crazy people.

29:28.782 --> 29:31.826
Trying to shame me into coming
back, saying I needed them,

29:31.869 --> 29:34.695
and that my life was
nothing without a purpose.

29:34.739 --> 29:37.695
So you turned to Ensign Wilt.

29:37.739 --> 29:41.739
She saw I was upset, and
she promised not to tell my dad.

29:41.782 --> 29:43.739
She knew computers,

29:43.782 --> 29:45.739
and said she could help
without even having to be there.

29:45.782 --> 29:48.739
By accessing
your dad's hard drive.All I had to

29:48.782 --> 29:50.086
was give her a
few passwords,

29:50.130 --> 29:51.869
and she got in there in
the middle of the night.

29:51.913 --> 29:53.826
Deleted the e-mail account,

29:53.869 --> 29:55.652
blocked the chat room
and everyone on it.

30:00.130 --> 30:02.347
Do you know any
of them personally?

30:02.391 --> 30:04.347
Just their screen names.

30:04.391 --> 30:06.739
And only a few of these are
from that other chat room.

30:06.782 --> 30:08.521
Which ones?

30:08.565 --> 30:11.086
Hater-extreme39,

30:11.130 --> 30:13.086
Joker-B...

30:13.130 --> 30:15.739
and this one.

30:15.782 --> 30:18.000
Hellbent427.

30:18.043 --> 30:19.913
He's the one who
got me to join

30:19.956 --> 30:21.826
and got real mad when I quit.

30:21.869 --> 30:23.260
He took it personal.

30:23.304 --> 30:25.869
Said I made him look
bad to the others.

30:30.217 --> 30:34.826
Hey, McGee,
try Hellbent427.

30:34.869 --> 30:38.826
Dorneget, Hellbent427--
find him.

30:38.869 --> 30:40.304
Ooh, very original.

30:40.347 --> 30:42.173
Hell this, Hell that.

30:42.217 --> 30:44.347
Where's Gibbs?He's on his way.

30:44.391 --> 30:45.695
The car give you anything?

30:45.739 --> 30:49.173
Yeah. A lot of lint
and asphalt, but...

30:49.217 --> 30:51.130
Major Mass Spec
made up for it

30:51.173 --> 30:53.217
with tissue samples
from the wound.

30:53.260 --> 30:54.608
Come on, Abbs, keep talking.

30:54.652 --> 30:56.086
ABBY:
Perfect timing, Gibbs.

30:56.130 --> 30:58.217
Okay, so, first of all,
I would bet

30:58.260 --> 31:00.260
that the weapon was
most certainly a bayonet.

31:00.304 --> 31:02.739
It was dull, it was old,
not quite an antique.

31:02.782 --> 31:04.826
What? Not quite?

31:04.869 --> 31:08.782
Well, these mold spores
found inside the wound--

31:08.826 --> 31:11.956
they're dried up,
they're practically mummified.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.086
I'm guessing maybe
50 years old.

31:14.130 --> 31:16.739
That's a pretty
specific guess.

31:16.782 --> 31:19.000
Well, it's based
on a specific fungus.

31:19.043 --> 31:21.130
Aflatoxin B-One is

31:21.173 --> 31:23.434
commonly found
in deep-water rice paddies,

31:23.478 --> 31:25.434
and they're grown
in the Mekong Delta.

31:25.478 --> 31:27.695
It's off
a Vietnamese bayonet.

31:27.739 --> 31:29.869
Yeah, but it could be
one of ours used over there.

31:29.913 --> 31:31.739
I found six
significant collectors

31:31.782 --> 31:34.217
of Vietnam War memorabilia
in the Metro area.

31:34.260 --> 31:36.652
So, all we have
to do is visit them...NED: Excuse me, but

31:36.695 --> 31:40.391
is one of those collectors
named Simek? Bradley Simek?

31:40.434 --> 31:44.782
I have a Peter Simek
in Alexandria.

31:44.826 --> 31:46.304
Hellbent?

31:46.347 --> 31:48.913
According to the chat-room
support site, Hellbent427

31:48.956 --> 31:51.130
is Bradley Simek.

31:53.782 --> 31:56.565
Brad, get off your computer
and come down, please!

31:56.608 --> 31:58.956
You have company!

31:59.000 --> 32:01.565
Don't tell me
he skipped school again.

32:01.608 --> 32:05.260
Uh...No, nothing like that. We just
have a few questions for him.

32:05.304 --> 32:08.260
Is this Brad?

32:08.304 --> 32:10.826
Yeah, that's my little guy.
Not so little anymore.

32:10.869 --> 32:13.000
This is quite
the collection.

32:13.043 --> 32:15.478
Oh, Peter thought so--
my late husband.

32:15.521 --> 32:18.086
I'm not a fan,
but Brad likes it.

32:18.130 --> 32:20.086
Reminds him
of his father.

32:20.130 --> 32:22.434
Um, you know, he must be
on those damn headphones.

32:22.478 --> 32:25.217
Why don't you just
come on up?

32:25.260 --> 32:27.043
Brad?

32:27.086 --> 32:29.782
I've been calling you.

32:32.086 --> 32:34.695
No Brad.

32:34.739 --> 32:37.000
This looks like
your rig at home.

32:37.043 --> 32:40.000
Not really. I certainly don't
have a 3-D printer.

32:40.043 --> 32:41.608
[distant whirring]

32:41.652 --> 32:44.086
That is our garage door.

32:56.391 --> 32:58.652
NCIS, stop!

32:58.695 --> 33:00.304
That's my car!

33:00.347 --> 33:02.130
He doesn't even have
his license!

33:02.173 --> 33:04.173
Oh, my God.

33:11.043 --> 33:12.826
Okay, boys, lay it on me.

33:12.869 --> 33:14.739
If one of these isn't the murder
weapon, there's a third one

33:14.782 --> 33:16.826
missing that probably is.Okay, I'll look at them,

33:16.869 --> 33:18.304
but I was talking about
this baby.

33:18.347 --> 33:19.782
Careful, this baby's heavy.

33:19.826 --> 33:21.608
BOLOs are out on the car
and Bradley Simek.

33:21.652 --> 33:23.260
No sightings yet.

33:23.304 --> 33:24.956
You ping his phone, McGee?Well, I kept trying, boss,

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
but either his
phone is turned off

33:27.043 --> 33:28.739
or he's figured out a
way to block my signal.

33:28.782 --> 33:30.173
Either way,
he's savvy enough to know

33:30.217 --> 33:31.739
we can use his phone
to find him.

33:31.782 --> 33:32.869
Savvy enough to figure out
Ensign Wilt

33:32.913 --> 33:34.478
blocked his chat room?

33:34.521 --> 33:37.217
Well, if not him, definitely
the people running it.

33:37.260 --> 33:38.478
Dark Web stuff.

33:38.521 --> 33:40.826
Nothing you can Google,
and very advanced.

33:40.869 --> 33:43.478
It's all right here on the
computer-- files, programs,

33:43.521 --> 33:45.782
games, 3-D printer software.

33:45.826 --> 33:47.260
He has a 3-D printer?

33:47.304 --> 33:49.086
Mm. McGee was very jealous.

33:49.130 --> 33:51.217
I'm very jealous.I call dibs, Gibbs.

33:51.260 --> 33:54.434
Whoa, dibs, Abby? I'm Cyber Ops
now, I already have dibs.

33:54.478 --> 33:57.347
Now you both got dibs--
double dibs, both of you, go,

33:57.391 --> 33:59.347
together, now.

33:59.391 --> 34:02.391
Send everything you got on this
kid to Ducky for a profile.

34:05.608 --> 34:08.391
Huh. You hear
Dark Web or Deep Web--

34:08.434 --> 34:10.565
think it'd be scarier.

34:10.608 --> 34:12.086
Jimmy, the Deep Web's
not a bad place.

34:12.130 --> 34:13.869
There's just bad apples,
like everywhere else.

34:13.913 --> 34:16.478
And that's not even
the Deep Web.

34:16.521 --> 34:18.956
That's just my screen saver.

34:19.000 --> 34:20.260
This is Bradley Simek's desktop.

34:20.304 --> 34:21.652
JIMMY:
Aah!

34:21.695 --> 34:22.913
Okay, then.

34:22.956 --> 34:25.391
And these are his chats
and his e-mails

34:25.434 --> 34:27.000
for you and Ducky
to profile.

34:27.043 --> 34:29.217
Oh, thanks for including me
in there, but

34:29.260 --> 34:32.391
Dr. Mallard's really
the profiler, I'm just the...

34:32.434 --> 34:35.391
You are the wind
beneath his wings.

34:35.434 --> 34:37.086
Now go...

34:37.130 --> 34:39.260
blow.

34:39.304 --> 34:42.043
VANCE:
So this kid was friends

34:42.086 --> 34:43.739
with Korkmaz's daughter?

34:43.782 --> 34:45.869
Hardly friends, Director.
They are in the same school

34:45.913 --> 34:49.217
with hundreds of other teens,
but Layna barely knew him.

34:49.260 --> 34:51.695
She had no idea he
was in the chat room.

34:51.739 --> 34:54.130
The kid wanted to pull her
into what he was doing.

34:54.173 --> 34:56.000
BISHOP:
But they never even spoke.

34:56.043 --> 34:58.565
Apparently, he rarely
spoke to anyone.

34:58.608 --> 35:01.000
Shy, loner, brooding.

35:01.043 --> 35:02.391
Practically a stereotype.[phone rings]

35:02.434 --> 35:03.739
Yeah, Duck,

35:03.782 --> 35:04.956
I'll be right down.

35:07.217 --> 35:08.217
Jake, need something?

35:08.260 --> 35:11.043
Gibbs, Director, are we good?

35:11.086 --> 35:12.956
I hope the delay
didn't hurt you any.

35:14.217 --> 35:16.391
Well, we'll find out.

35:18.217 --> 35:20.347
All good, Malloy.

35:23.826 --> 35:26.956
Jake, I...I did my job.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.043
No worries.

35:29.086 --> 35:32.043
Then I should get back to mine.

35:32.086 --> 35:34.521
Ellie.

35:34.565 --> 35:38.304
I wish you'd told me.

35:39.956 --> 35:42.000
We'll talk later.

35:51.130 --> 35:52.782
What do we think, Duck?

35:52.826 --> 35:56.043
We have a textbook
teenage misfit here, Jethro,

35:56.086 --> 35:58.434
using his chat
room to express

35:58.478 --> 35:59.869
unsettling thoughts

35:59.913 --> 36:02.173
that he would never have
the nerve to say in public.

36:02.217 --> 36:03.869
He's hiding
behind a screen name.

36:03.913 --> 36:07.043
Well, with few friends
and no one to turn to, he finds

36:07.086 --> 36:10.217
kinship with others
facing similar demons.

36:10.260 --> 36:13.521
They're-they're linked
by a common cause.

36:13.565 --> 36:15.521
Like a terrorist group.

36:15.565 --> 36:17.608
Well, I wouldn't hesitate
to make that leap.

36:17.652 --> 36:21.130
And SSó_BUILDER-48

36:21.173 --> 36:23.391
is especially hostile.

36:23.434 --> 36:26.086
"The world hates you,
Hellbent427,

36:26.130 --> 36:28.565
even more than you
hate the world."

36:28.608 --> 36:31.608
Steady diet of that's liable
to twist any kid's mind.

36:31.652 --> 36:34.043
There anything in here about
where this kid might have gone?

36:34.086 --> 36:35.304
Not in his chat room.

36:35.347 --> 36:38.173
Mr. Palmer?Uh, not in his e-mails, uh, no.

36:38.217 --> 36:40.217
From what I can tell, when he's
not at school, his whole world

36:40.260 --> 36:42.043
is about his room
and his computer.

36:42.086 --> 36:43.347
And his father.

36:43.391 --> 36:45.130
His father? Father's dead.

36:45.173 --> 36:47.217
He died three years ago,
of a heart attack,

36:47.260 --> 36:51.000
but Brad still e-mails
him every few weeks.

36:51.043 --> 36:52.739
None of them being
returned, obviously.

36:52.782 --> 36:55.347
Having trouble coping
with a significant loss

36:55.391 --> 36:58.434
at a delicate age
makes him an easy mark.

36:58.478 --> 37:00.391
Why the ensign?

37:00.434 --> 37:03.913
Well, they were trying to
recruit young Layna Korkmaz.

37:03.956 --> 37:05.304
Ensign Wilt got in the way.

37:05.347 --> 37:08.217
And what's more to the point,

37:08.260 --> 37:12.304
she could trace them back
to their true identities.

37:12.347 --> 37:14.739
So Hellbent handled it?

37:14.782 --> 37:16.869
To prove himself.

37:21.260 --> 37:23.826
There's a whole lot of hate
being thrown around on here.

37:23.869 --> 37:26.086
Who are these people?I don't know.

37:26.130 --> 37:28.304
I'm hating this
encrypted folder right now.

37:28.347 --> 37:30.043
A dictionary attack
on this password

37:30.086 --> 37:31.739
would take, like, years.

37:31.782 --> 37:33.434
Did you try Hellbent427?

37:33.478 --> 37:35.434
His screen name?

37:38.217 --> 37:40.391
Huh.

37:40.434 --> 37:42.347
[chuckling]:
Well, that was easy.

37:42.391 --> 37:45.260
Some of the best hackers I know
use the most obvious passwords.

37:45.304 --> 37:47.086
[beeping]Oh, Major Mass Spec needs me.

37:47.130 --> 37:50.260
What's the magic machine
chewing on now?

37:51.869 --> 37:54.217
Whoa.

37:54.260 --> 37:56.043
Gunpowder.

37:56.086 --> 37:57.869
In minute traces.

37:57.913 --> 37:59.173
From where?

37:59.217 --> 38:00.608
Brad's computer tower.

38:00.652 --> 38:02.695
I swabbed the power button,
just in case.

38:02.739 --> 38:04.739
What do you make of this?

38:06.652 --> 38:08.173
Looks like a blueprint.

38:08.217 --> 38:10.826
Encoded for a 3-D printer.

38:10.869 --> 38:12.869
McGee said the kid
had one, right?

38:14.695 --> 38:16.260
It's some kind of mechanism.

38:16.304 --> 38:18.391
Wait a minute, is that...

38:18.434 --> 38:22.260
Where's Gibbs?

38:22.304 --> 38:23.347
Got a hit on the BOLO, Gibbs.

38:23.391 --> 38:24.782
Somewhere in McLean.

38:24.826 --> 38:26.391
We're trying
to get an exact location.

38:26.434 --> 38:28.304
Okay, the helo's up;
Virginia State Police are on it.

38:28.347 --> 38:31.695
Gibbs, he's got a bomb.Where, Abbs?

38:31.739 --> 38:33.347
I don't know,
but the kid has gunpowder

38:33.391 --> 38:34.608
on his computer,

38:34.652 --> 38:36.434
and a blueprint
for a plastic detonator.

38:36.478 --> 38:39.043
Gibbs, he printed a detonator.

38:39.086 --> 38:41.043
Okay, we got the car parked
near the corner

38:41.086 --> 38:43.608
of Waverly and Birch Hill,
in McLean.

38:43.652 --> 38:44.739
No sign of Simek.

38:44.782 --> 38:45.913
Wait, I got his phone.

38:45.956 --> 38:47.260
Must have turned
it back on.

38:47.304 --> 38:48.260
Okay, get us a location.

38:48.304 --> 38:49.260
He's on the move.

38:49.304 --> 38:51.173
Everyone, let's go.

38:51.217 --> 38:53.304
LOIS:
Brad?

38:53.347 --> 38:55.347
Bradley, is that you?

38:55.391 --> 38:58.043
Talk to me, baby.

38:58.086 --> 39:00.391
Answer me.

39:00.434 --> 39:02.000
Please come home.

39:02.043 --> 39:04.000
I'm so worried.

39:10.000 --> 39:11.217
Sit-rep?

39:11.260 --> 39:14.782
Bomb squad's on standby,
waiting for a location.

39:14.826 --> 39:16.347
Location keeps changing.

39:16.391 --> 39:18.260
The kid's
cell signal's moving fast.

39:18.304 --> 39:19.782
Too fast to be on foot.

39:19.826 --> 39:21.000
Ditched his car
for someone else's

39:21.043 --> 39:22.347
and heading across town.

39:22.391 --> 39:23.434
BISHOP:
That road's a bus line.

39:23.478 --> 39:25.086
Six eastbound.

39:25.130 --> 39:26.434
I need a bus number.

39:26.478 --> 39:29.130
Tell the driver to
pull over and stay put.

40:01.913 --> 40:03.913
[engine slowing]

40:09.782 --> 40:11.434
Open the side door.

40:16.869 --> 40:18.913
Okay, get off.

40:24.217 --> 40:25.434
Everybody get off.

40:30.913 --> 40:32.347
No! Nobody move!

40:32.391 --> 40:34.391
Don't!

40:34.434 --> 40:36.782
Don't.

40:38.739 --> 40:41.565
Let them go, Brad.

40:41.608 --> 40:43.913
They haven't done anything
to you.

40:47.086 --> 40:48.608
Stay back.

40:48.652 --> 40:50.434
Go on, get out of here.

40:50.478 --> 40:53.130
Go, go, go, go, go.

40:55.173 --> 40:56.608
GIBBS:
Easy.

40:56.652 --> 40:58.652
Easy, easy.

40:59.565 --> 41:01.000
Come on.

41:02.695 --> 41:05.652
You made your point, Brad.

41:07.130 --> 41:09.000
Hellbent.

41:10.913 --> 41:12.826
The coach?

41:12.869 --> 41:14.826
No, no, th-that wasn't,

41:14.869 --> 41:16.217
that wasn't me.

41:16.260 --> 41:18.043
It-it-it was my knife,

41:18.086 --> 41:19.521
but I didn't, I didn't do it.

41:19.565 --> 41:21.826
Well, don't do this.

41:23.695 --> 41:25.826
Your dad wouldn't want you
to do this.

41:27.956 --> 41:29.173
Your mom, either.

41:29.217 --> 41:31.608
She's outside.

41:37.000 --> 41:38.608
Come on.

41:43.565 --> 41:45.086
Come on.

41:45.130 --> 41:46.521
Let's go talk to your mom.

41:46.565 --> 41:47.869
Follow me out.

41:47.913 --> 41:50.043
Follow me.

41:50.086 --> 41:51.000
Come on.

41:53.173 --> 41:55.913
It's okay.

41:55.956 --> 41:56.869
Let's go talk to her.

41:56.913 --> 41:59.043
Follow me.

41:59.086 --> 42:00.434
Come on, Brad.

42:00.478 --> 42:03.391
That's it.

42:03.434 --> 42:05.782
Doing good.

42:05.826 --> 42:08.652
Come on, almost there.

42:12.956 --> 42:14.086
That's good, Brad.

42:14.130 --> 42:15.652
Drop the bag.

42:18.913 --> 42:20.913
Just put it down.

42:20.956 --> 42:23.000
Put it down.

42:26.347 --> 42:29.000
That's it.

42:32.913 --> 42:34.000
Look-- Brad, look at me.

42:37.086 --> 42:39.869
You're a good kid.

42:40.956 --> 42:43.478
No, I'm not.

42:46.260 --> 42:47.782
No!
