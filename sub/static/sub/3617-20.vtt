The truth revealed

14:17.167 --> 14:18.818
Open hearts and
secrets unsealed

14:18.918 --> 14:20.192
From now until
it's now again

14:20.292 --> 14:22.834
After which
the memory ends

14:25.083 --> 14:26.083
Did you see that?

14:27.501 --> 14:30.626
Okay, here goes nothing.

14:31.792 --> 14:33.899
Nate...

14:33.999 --> 14:36.609
...I'm a witch.
A real witch,

14:36.709 --> 14:39.899
with real magical powers,

14:39.999 --> 14:42.999
and I just kind of wanted to see
if maybe you'd be open to that.

14:46.999 --> 14:48.375
What are you talking about?

14:49.417 --> 14:50.999
I'm talking about this.

14:53.334 --> 14:55.125
Behind you.

14:56.792 --> 15:00.234
- How did you do that?
- I told you, I'm a witch.

15:00.334 --> 15:03.567
I just kind of wanted to see
how you'd feel about it

15:03.667 --> 15:06.401
before I went any further
into the relationship.

15:06.501 --> 15:09.859
I can see that you don't feel
so very good about it.

15:09.959 --> 15:12.442
Let me just get my
head around this.

15:12.542 --> 15:15.292
You don't see stuff
like this every day.

15:20.584 --> 15:24.000
Maybe you would
be okay with it?

15:25.709 --> 15:27.651
Yeah. Hell, yeah.

15:27.751 --> 15:30.899
I mean, but I always sort
of thought this stuff
was real, you know,

15:30.999 --> 15:33.942
I just didn't really know
it was really real, you know?

15:34.042 --> 15:35.459
My God, my wife
is gonna love this.

15:37.876 --> 15:40.275
- Excuse me?
- Did I just say "wife"?

15:40.375 --> 15:43.942
You're married? You never
told me you were married.

15:44.042 --> 15:46.942
Yeah, and I didn't tell you
I had children either, but--

15:47.042 --> 15:48.834
Did I just say kids too?

15:51.751 --> 15:52.899
PIPER:
See, I was right.

15:52.999 --> 15:55.317
You vanquished this demon
60 years ago.

15:55.417 --> 15:57.442
The Necromancer
is not a demon,

15:57.542 --> 15:59.818
he's the ghost of a demon.
And it wasn't a vanquish,

15:59.918 --> 16:02.317
I banished him back
into the spirit realm.

16:02.417 --> 16:05.234
Well, then you should be
a little more specific
in your wording.

16:05.334 --> 16:08.734
The point is,
he's had about 70 years

16:08.834 --> 16:10.899
to find a way out
of the spirit realm.

16:10.999 --> 16:12.859
And that man, that...

16:12.959 --> 16:16.776
That demon is nothing
if not confident.

16:16.876 --> 16:18.234
I guess I'll take
your word for it,

16:18.334 --> 16:21.567
considering you seem
to know so much about him.

16:21.667 --> 16:23.899
"Enjoys Clark Gable movies"?

16:23.999 --> 16:27.899
"Favorite dinner,
lamb chops with mint jelly."

16:27.999 --> 16:30.234
Well, I mean, you never
know what will be useful.

16:30.334 --> 16:34.899
So, what do you suggest,
that I go to the video store
and you get cooking?

16:34.999 --> 16:36.484
Don't be so literal.

16:36.584 --> 16:39.359
I was just trying to show
how much he craves life,

16:39.459 --> 16:42.942
the sensuousness of it.
Food, drink, sex--

16:43.042 --> 16:45.567
Don't! I don't wanna hear about
a dead demon doing the dirty.

16:45.667 --> 16:48.542
He wants to be resurrected.

16:49.792 --> 16:51.942
It says that he has
dominion over the dead.

16:52.042 --> 16:53.899
You would think
that would be enough.

16:53.999 --> 16:56.776
Not for him it isn't. He only
uses his power over the dead

16:56.876 --> 16:59.899
to absorb their spirit
and get a temporary fix of life.

16:59.999 --> 17:02.818
But he was always searching
for magical spirits

17:02.918 --> 17:06.733
with enough power
to resurrect himself for good.

17:06.834 --> 17:09.317
Like all the spirits
of the Halliwell matriarchs.

17:09.416 --> 17:11.442
That's why he attacked
at your mother's Wiccanning.

17:11.541 --> 17:13.900
Now you see why
I'm so worried.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.733
Okay, so if he's out,
we'll send him packing
back to the spirit realm,

17:16.834 --> 17:19.150
because nothing is gonna get in
the way of Wyatt's Wiccanning.

17:19.250 --> 17:22.776
Good. And I know just
the potion to use on him too.

17:22.876 --> 17:27.526
Let's see,
we'll need some dragonroot,

17:27.626 --> 17:30.899
eelskin, blood wort...

17:30.999 --> 17:36.526
You know, Piper, I'm still
surprised that you had a boy.

17:36.626 --> 17:39.526
- Well, fifty-fifty chance.
- Not in our family.

17:39.626 --> 17:41.900
Three hundred years
and not a male in the bunch.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.899
- I guess our family's changing.
- Mm.

17:44.999 --> 17:48.401
Well, I mean, it just begs a few
questions, don't you think?

17:48.501 --> 17:52.900
I mean, we've never had
a male witch. And, you know,
men are just so...

17:53.000 --> 17:55.359
They're just evil,
that's what they are.

17:55.459 --> 17:57.442
They are just plain evil.

17:57.542 --> 18:00.983
Oh, I take it Nate wasn't too
happy about you being a witch.

18:01.083 --> 18:03.025
Nate was fine with it.

18:03.125 --> 18:04.899
It's maybe his wife that
would've had a problem.

18:04.999 --> 18:08.442
- He's married?
- Yeah, with two kids.

18:08.542 --> 18:11.067
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.

18:11.167 --> 18:13.234
I told you she should've
gotten a dog.

18:13.334 --> 18:15.442
What did you do
when you found out?

18:15.542 --> 18:16.899
Plenty.

18:16.999 --> 18:19.526
I mean, I'm sure plenty
will happen to him,

18:19.626 --> 18:21.651
karmically speaking.

18:21.751 --> 18:23.859
The cheat.

18:23.959 --> 18:25.334
Well...

18:27.209 --> 18:29.876
...there's no wrath like a
witch scorned, I always say.

18:31.501 --> 18:33.209
Care to take it out on him?

Wait, so he called
her by her name?

19:20.999 --> 19:22.776
Penny. Yeah.
Kind of weird, huh?

19:22.876 --> 19:24.776
Yeah, and he acted
like he liked her.

19:27.167 --> 19:29.484
That's Chinese for
"excuse me."

19:29.584 --> 19:31.526
Fascinating.

19:31.626 --> 19:34.692
- Did you guys vanquish him?
- He's dead,
he can't be vanquished.

19:34.792 --> 19:39.109
But we did send his sorry male
ass back to the spirit realm.

19:39.209 --> 19:42.818
Okay, let's not jump on Grams'
male-bashing bandwagon, please.

19:42.918 --> 19:44.609
Grams is a wise woman.

19:44.709 --> 19:45.983
I'll be sure to
let Wyatt know.

19:46.083 --> 19:48.983
Don't worry, we're not gonna let
him grow up to be a slime bag.

19:49.083 --> 19:53.109
Great, so let's focus on
blessing him in light and
goodness.

19:53.209 --> 19:56.150

the Chinese thing?

20:02.501 --> 20:04.983
It's a little souvenir that
Jason brought me back from China

20:05.083 --> 20:06.899
when he was there
on his business trip.

20:06.999 --> 20:09.899
Hah! Business trip.
Yeah, business trip.

20:09.999 --> 20:11.567
A likely story.

20:11.667 --> 20:13.899
- What is that supposed to mean?
- I'm just saying.

20:13.999 --> 20:15.899
He could be leading
a double life.

20:15.999 --> 20:19.899
He could be married,
he could have a mistress,
he could be gay.

20:19.999 --> 20:22.275
- You don't know.
There are many variables.
- [PHONE RINGING]

20:22.375 --> 20:25.609
- Or he could just
be perfect for me.
- Don't be so sure.

20:25.709 --> 20:28.192
Men are full of surprises,
that's all.

20:28.292 --> 20:32.899
Funny you should mention
surprises, because he had a
little surprise for me.

20:32.999 --> 20:33.899
LEO: Paige?

20:33.999 --> 20:36.442
Darryl's on the phone.
He's pissed.

20:36.542 --> 20:37.899
Something about
your boyfriend?

20:37.999 --> 20:43.000
He's not my boyfriend,
he's my ex-boyfriend.

20:45.999 --> 20:49.067
What are you doing with Wyatt?
Grams was gonna spend
time with him.

20:49.167 --> 20:52.484
- Well, she didn't want to.
- What? That's ridiculous.

20:52.584 --> 20:55.983
Really? Then why didn't
she want to touch him,
change him or feed him?

20:56.083 --> 20:59.275
Well, she's probably just
resting before the ceremony.

20:59.375 --> 21:02.025
She said she would do it
as soon as we get rid of
the Necromancer.

21:02.125 --> 21:04.776
This has nothing to do
with the Necromancer,
and you know it.

21:04.876 --> 21:08.959

that Wyatt's a boy, and she
makes no bones about it.

And I summoned you
in record time too.

count on that.

- Penny Halliwell.

21:46.542 --> 21:49.359
The witch who stole my heart.

21:49.459 --> 21:52.067
You should have seen her.
The glint in her eye.

21:52.167 --> 21:54.899
The way she held up
her hand and sent me
hurtling into that wall.

21:54.999 --> 21:55.983
Youch.

21:56.083 --> 21:58.776
Didn't hurt as much
as the potion did, though.

I could tell she made it
herself. The flames were
excruciating.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.899
She was furious with me.
Which can only mean one thing.

She still feels
the passion, the heat.

22:11.417 --> 22:12.734
You sure that wasn't the fire?

22:12.834 --> 22:15.899
If only I knew why
she came back here.

22:15.999 --> 22:19.692
Why leave a cozy
eternity up there?

Uh, it could have to do
with the new baby.

- Baby? What baby?
- Oh.

22:24.167 --> 22:27.275
It's the talk of
the underworld. One of the
Charmed Ones had a kid.

one we're not to mess with.

- Oh, Piper, you scared me.

22:54.999 --> 22:58.983
Hm. I didn't know you
could scare a ghost.

22:59.083 --> 23:01.859
- We need to talk.
- About?

23:01.959 --> 23:03.109
I think you know what about.

23:03.209 --> 23:05.651
Leo seems to think you don't
wanna be around Wyatt

23:05.751 --> 23:08.999
for some reason, and I'm
beginning to wonder myself.

23:11.999 --> 23:13.859
This is all my fault.

23:13.959 --> 23:16.899
I mean, maybe if I'd lived
longer, had been around longer,

23:16.999 --> 23:20.899
maybe things would've worked out
the way they were supposed to.

23:22.876 --> 23:24.401
This.

23:24.501 --> 23:26.776
Wyatt.

23:26.876 --> 23:29.818
Oh, you mean because
he's not a girl?

23:29.918 --> 23:31.692
Piper, you know as well as I do

23:31.792 --> 23:34.899
that the Charmed line
is supposed to be led by women,

23:34.999 --> 23:36.818
- not men.
- Who says?

23:36.918 --> 23:39.526
Tradition says. Destiny says.

23:39.626 --> 23:42.899
Tell me that you didn't hope
to have a little girl,

23:42.999 --> 23:45.776
expect to have a little girl,
just like you foresaw.

23:45.876 --> 23:48.317
Well, of course, but so what?

23:48.417 --> 23:51.484
"So what" is something went
wrong, terribly wrong.

This is not the baby
you were meant to have.

23:54.042 --> 23:55.192
Grams.

23:55.292 --> 23:57.317
You saw it when you went
to the future.

23:57.417 --> 24:00.899
The future where Prue was
still alive and witches
were burned at the stake.

24:00.999 --> 24:04.067
- Things change.
- Not this.

24:04.167 --> 24:08.484
Oh, it's just that I'm worried
about the family, you know.

24:08.584 --> 24:10.192
We don't know what to expect.

24:10.292 --> 24:15.401
I know. That's why we shouldn't
treat him any differently
because he's a boy.

24:15.501 --> 24:17.692
That's why we're going
to do the ceremony.

24:17.792 --> 24:20.083
At the very least,
he deserves that.

24:21.834 --> 24:23.042

24:24.167 --> 24:25.792
I can't.

Come on, this is outrageous.

24:29.209 --> 24:30.859
I'll sue you for false
imprisonment.

When I get out, I'm gonna tell
everybody about you, you witch.

For your information,

just make you tell the truth.

24:37.250 --> 24:38.834
Something you might
wanna think about.

24:40.542 --> 24:43.776
Are you out of your mind? You
can't orb in here and think
that's gonna fly.

24:43.876 --> 24:45.442
- Because it's not.
- Why not?

24:45.542 --> 24:48.234
- Do you know what he did?
- I don't care what he did.

24:48.334 --> 24:49.899
Get him out of here, now.

25:03.876 --> 25:05.899
Look, he's a jerk, fine.

25:05.999 --> 25:08.942
But cheating is immoral,
it's not illegal.

25:09.042 --> 25:10.776
All right, I understand that.

25:10.876 --> 25:12.484
And I can't deny
that I'm taking some sort

25:12.584 --> 25:14.401
of personal pleasure
from this, because I am.

25:14.501 --> 25:17.834
But that's not the main thing
that's happening here.

25:19.417 --> 25:22.192
I cast a truth spell.

25:22.292 --> 25:25.275
- Oh, no.
- It's just a little one.

25:25.375 --> 25:28.609
But it's a good thing I did.
Otherwise I wouldn't know
what a jerk he is.

25:28.709 --> 25:31.692
- This is so not my problem.
- Actually, it is.

25:31.792 --> 25:34.692
Because if he goes out,
he's gonna be telling
people that I'm a witch,

25:34.792 --> 25:38.567
and also about my
special friend,
the cop who helps the witch.

25:38.667 --> 25:41.776
What am I supposed to do,
keep him in here indefinitely?

25:41.876 --> 25:45.401
No, not indefinitely. Just,
like, the next 20 hours or so.

25:45.501 --> 25:48.042
What am I supposed to tell
the other cops if they hear him?

25:50.292 --> 25:52.526
Just tell them he's insane.

25:52.626 --> 25:55.899
You are crazy. This isn't
about him or our legacy.

25:55.999 --> 25:58.899
- This is about you.
- Piper, you don't understand.

25:58.999 --> 26:01.359
That you don't want to perform
a blessing on my son?

26:01.459 --> 26:03.983
You are damn right
I do not understand.

26:04.083 --> 26:06.109
You see him as an
innocent little boy.

26:06.209 --> 26:08.401
But he won't be like
that, not for long.

26:08.501 --> 26:10.692
So you can't even hold
him because someday,

26:10.792 --> 26:13.776
some very far-away day,
he will become a man?

26:13.876 --> 26:15.983
Men cannot be
trusted with magic.

26:16.083 --> 26:17.899
They can't handle it.
They're weak.

26:17.999 --> 26:20.275
And evil will
eventually win out.

26:20.375 --> 26:21.818
That is silly.
Look at Leo!

26:21.918 --> 26:24.692
Oh, well, Leo. I mean, he's an
angel. You can't count Leo.

26:24.792 --> 26:27.484
Hey, what's going on here?

26:27.584 --> 26:30.192
Your grandmother hates
her grandson,
that's what's going on.

26:30.292 --> 26:31.818
That is not true.

26:31.918 --> 26:35.401
Oh, I'm sorry, you just
hate men, is that correct?

26:35.501 --> 26:37.567
No, I don't trust men.
There's a difference.

26:37.667 --> 26:40.275
And there is a reason
that they don't last
long in this family.

26:40.375 --> 26:42.442
They're always trying to
take advantage of what we have.

26:42.542 --> 26:44.651
- That's not true.
- Isn't it?

26:44.751 --> 26:47.692
Look what Cole put you through.
Look what your father
did to your mother.

26:47.792 --> 26:51.776
We're supposed to give up
on trying to find love
because we might get hurt?

26:51.876 --> 26:55.234
Oh, no, you will get hurt.
That's our legacy too,
unfortunately.

26:55.334 --> 26:58.651
You know what, forget it.
You couldn't bless my son
with any kind of goodness

26:58.751 --> 27:01.567
because you are too
consumed by your bitterness.

27:01.667 --> 27:04.234
- Piper.
- And since his father is an
angel,

27:04.334 --> 27:06.501
we will take our chances
without a Wiccanning!

27:07.751 --> 27:09.501
[GRUNTS]

27:10.209 --> 27:11.667
[GASPS]

27:12.751 --> 27:14.918
Leave them alone. Ah!

27:16.999 --> 27:18.417
- Surprise.
- PHOEBE: Piper!

27:19.375 --> 27:20.501
Ah!

27:28.876 --> 27:31.150
Well, let's face it.
Grams would not be in this
position

27:31.250 --> 27:33.899
if she hadn't sent us after
the guy in the first place.

27:33.999 --> 27:36.484
Not helpful. We have to
summon her back here, fast.

27:36.584 --> 27:39.609
We can't. The Necromancer
will follow, and you don't
have a way to stop him.

27:39.709 --> 27:42.692
How did he get a clean shot at
her? Weren't you guys with her?

27:42.792 --> 27:45.859
- Uh...
- We were fighting with her.

27:45.959 --> 27:48.401
- Fighting? About what?
- PIPER: Uh, later.

27:48.501 --> 27:51.899
Let's just focus on the
vanquishing and the saving.

27:51.999 --> 27:53.567
PHOEBE:
Yeah, but I don't know how to.

27:53.667 --> 27:56.067
It's not like we could even
vanquish him, he's a ghost.

27:56.167 --> 28:00.025
Well, ghosts can still feel
pain. Maybe I could just orb
his testicles somewhere.

28:00.125 --> 28:03.899
Paige, there will be no
talk of testicle-orbing
in front of the child.

28:03.999 --> 28:06.317
And not around his daddy either.

28:06.417 --> 28:08.292
Oh, criminy, I'm just
trying to help.

28:12.709 --> 28:16.776
Okay, there's got to be a
weakness in here somewhere.

28:16.876 --> 28:18.692
I mean, he must have
a weakness, right?

28:18.792 --> 28:21.692
Well, do mint jelly
and Clark Gable movies count?

28:21.792 --> 28:23.999
PIPER: She wrote it.

28:25.292 --> 28:27.776
Oh, my God.

28:27.876 --> 28:29.083
That's why she's so
obsessed with him.

28:31.292 --> 28:33.109
Grams was
the Necromancer's lover.

28:33.209 --> 28:35.234
[GASPS]

28:35.334 --> 28:37.899
- That's disgusting.
- Oh, no, I think you're right.

28:37.999 --> 28:39.859
That would explain everything.

28:39.959 --> 28:43.526
Grams was alive when she
banished the Necromancer, right?

28:43.626 --> 28:45.526
- Right.
- Okay, so now she's dead.

28:45.626 --> 28:48.192
- You sound so happy about that.
- No, that's not what she means.

28:48.292 --> 28:50.109
The ghost-vanquishing spell.

28:50.209 --> 28:54.042
- You gotta be dead
to use it, right?
- It's worth a shot.

29:00.918 --> 29:04.083
Your spirit is strong, Penny.

29:05.999 --> 29:09.584
Almost strong enough
to sustain us both.

29:11.167 --> 29:12.999
Almost.

29:16.292 --> 29:17.959
Awaken.

29:20.083 --> 29:22.709
No need to worry, Penny.
You're safe here.

29:23.667 --> 29:26.025
Ah, ah, ah.

29:26.125 --> 29:28.651
You're well aware
of my powers, Penny.

29:28.751 --> 29:33.025
I covet your spirit, and any
spirit I covet, I control.

29:33.125 --> 29:34.209
- You son of a--
- Shh.

29:36.501 --> 29:38.900
Of course you know,
the more you fight me,

29:39.000 --> 29:42.359
the more I know
that you still love me.

29:42.459 --> 29:45.567
Are you crazy?
I hate you.

29:45.667 --> 29:49.234
Yes. But you only hate me
because you once loved me.

29:49.334 --> 29:53.776
After all, we only hate
those who have gotten
close to us, don't we?

29:53.876 --> 29:56.542
Those who've gotten close
enough to touch our hearts.

29:58.918 --> 30:00.734
You used me.

30:00.834 --> 30:04.442
You preyed on my affections
just to get to my family.

30:04.542 --> 30:07.067
And for that I am
truly, truly sorry.

30:07.167 --> 30:09.042
I was just
trying to survive.

30:10.999 --> 30:13.959
I never intended to
fall in love with you either.

30:17.792 --> 30:19.401
What do you want, Armand?

30:19.501 --> 30:21.192
What I wanted then.

30:21.292 --> 30:23.776
Life, with you!

30:23.876 --> 30:26.651
Think about it.
Think about it, Penny.

30:26.751 --> 30:30.442
There's enough magic
in the Halliwell line
to resurrect us both!

30:30.542 --> 30:32.025
To give us a second
chance together.

30:32.125 --> 30:36.359
All you have to do is to call up
the spirits of the matriarchs.

30:36.459 --> 30:37.859
I'll do the rest.

30:37.959 --> 30:40.899
No, no. You will never
make me do that.

30:40.999 --> 30:42.859
I can if I have to.

30:42.959 --> 30:44.876
I'll tell my granddaughters,
they will destroy you--

30:48.125 --> 30:51.192
Oh, you haven't changed one bit.

30:51.292 --> 30:53.876
Isn't that why you loved me?

30:55.417 --> 30:58.776
Because I was dangerous?
Exciting?

30:58.876 --> 31:02.459
Why your heart beats a little
faster when I'm near you?

31:04.999 --> 31:06.125
Or when I do this?

31:13.751 --> 31:15.651
You still love me, Penny.

31:15.751 --> 31:17.734
You know it and I know it.

31:17.834 --> 31:21.209
And you're going to help
us both to live again...

31:21.999 --> 31:23.792
...forever.

As soon as we summon her,
we gotta get her straight
to the Book,

31:33.999 --> 31:35.900
because the Necromancer
is gonna be right behind her.

bad timing, don't they?

31:49.999 --> 31:52.025
Yeah, I kind of
owe him an answer.

31:52.125 --> 31:55.999

- He asked me to go back
to Hong Kong with him.

31:57.334 --> 31:58.584
To live.

32:00.417 --> 32:01.751

- Now is not really a good time.
- I need to talk to her.

32:08.999 --> 32:11.609
- I don't have much time.
- It's okay, Leo.

32:11.709 --> 32:13.275
- What about--?
- Don't worry about it.

- Hi.

32:19.375 --> 32:21.818
Listen, Phoebe,
I've been thinking.

32:21.918 --> 32:23.899
Yeah, me too.

32:23.999 --> 32:25.942
I shouldn't have asked you
to come with me like that.

32:26.042 --> 32:28.109
You shouldn't have?

32:28.209 --> 32:29.776
It's not that I don't
want you to, I do.

32:29.876 --> 32:31.067
I just--
I think I sort of

32:31.167 --> 32:33.899
blind-sided you with it
and I feel bad about it.

32:33.999 --> 32:36.192
Jason...

32:36.292 --> 32:39.692
And it was unfair of me
to spring it on you like that,

32:39.792 --> 32:42.192
knowing how close you
are to your family.

32:42.292 --> 32:43.983
That's really sweet--

32:44.083 --> 32:46.899
I don't wanna pressure
you into deciding.

32:46.999 --> 32:50.900
And I wanted you to know
that if you need more time
to think about it--

32:51.000 --> 32:52.192
I don't.

32:52.292 --> 32:54.567
- You don't?
- No, I don't.

32:54.667 --> 32:56.983
I do love my family,
and I don't wanna leave them.

32:57.083 --> 33:00.859
But I think if I don't,
at least for a little while,

33:00.959 --> 33:03.942
then I'm gonna wind up
like my grandmother,
and I don't want that.

33:04.042 --> 33:08.526

to fight it.

but to do as I wish.

Come on, come on.
This way, this way, this way.

34:26.542 --> 34:28.275
That is a spell
to vanquish a ghost.

34:28.375 --> 34:30.067
But only a
ghost can read it.

- And that's you.
- You shouldn't have done this.

Oh, come on, Grams,

Grams, he's gonna
be here any second.

34:39.167 --> 34:41.417
I know, I know. It's just
that I don't think that--

34:43.208 --> 34:46.000
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

34:47.833 --> 34:51.567
I never meant to hurt you.
Or Wyatt.

34:51.667 --> 34:56.317
Right. Okay, we kind of
need to focus on the
demon at hand here, okay?

34:56.417 --> 34:59.751
Whoa. Incoming!

35:02.999 --> 35:05.983
- Now, Grams!
- Grams, read the spell.

35:06.083 --> 35:08.334
Don't bother.
She's with me now.

35:12.125 --> 35:14.083
It's time, dear.

35:21.918 --> 35:23.275
Piper, blow him up
or something.

35:23.375 --> 35:25.234
The ghost? You want me
to blow up the ghost?

35:25.334 --> 35:26.567
He's already dead.

Use it on Grams.

For those who want
The truth revealed

35:36.667 --> 35:38.567
Open hearts and
secrets unsealed

35:38.667 --> 35:40.234
From now until
it's now again

35:40.334 --> 35:42.709
After which the memory ends.

35:43.876 --> 35:46.526
Penny, finish the spell.

35:46.626 --> 35:50.167
Grams? Tell him how you
really feel about him.
Tell him the truth.

35:53.999 --> 35:55.125
I love you.

35:56.501 --> 35:58.025
Any other bright ideas?

35:58.125 --> 36:01.734
And now I know that
you didn't just use me,

36:01.834 --> 36:03.899
that you really
did love me too.

36:03.999 --> 36:05.000
I still do.

36:06.334 --> 36:09.484
I know. But the truth is

36:09.584 --> 36:11.983
that our love isn't
nearly as powerful

36:12.083 --> 36:14.209
as the love I
have for my family.

Ashes to ashes,
spirit to spirit

36:23.999 --> 36:26.234
- Take his soul
- Penny, what are you doing?

36:26.334 --> 36:27.876
Banish this evil

36:34.083 --> 36:35.626
Penny.

36:46.709 --> 36:48.818
I am so sorry.

36:48.918 --> 36:50.859
I never realized how much

36:50.959 --> 36:54.776
my anger, my bitterness,
affected my life.

36:54.876 --> 36:57.317
Or yours.

36:57.417 --> 36:58.899
But I'm most sorry
for what I did

36:58.999 --> 37:02.692
to my great-grandson
and you.

37:02.792 --> 37:05.067
And if ever I wanted
a second chance,

37:05.167 --> 37:08.250
it would be with him...

37:09.999 --> 37:11.250
...and you.

37:21.667 --> 37:23.734
Don't make the
same mistake I did.

37:23.834 --> 37:25.501
Don't ever give up on love.

37:51.209 --> 37:53.317
Paige, you gotta
let me out of here sometime.

37:53.417 --> 37:54.983
You can't keep me
in here forever.

37:55.083 --> 37:56.900
Don't worry.
When the spell wears off

37:57.000 --> 38:00.651
you won't remember
a single thing.

38:00.751 --> 38:03.275
Although I've got a couple
of things I'd like to say
to you before it does.

38:03.375 --> 38:04.899
Say it fast, will you?

38:04.999 --> 38:06.192
Shush.

38:06.292 --> 38:08.859
You know, Paige,
I've been thinking.

38:08.959 --> 38:10.401
I've been in here a long time,

38:10.501 --> 38:13.209
and I realize what I did
to you was really wrong.

38:15.042 --> 38:16.375
I hope you're buying this.

38:18.792 --> 38:20.900
You know, I thought you would
have a problem with magic,

38:21.000 --> 38:24.899
I didn't think you would be a
problem on a basic human level.

38:24.999 --> 38:28.234
I was gonna tell you
about Morgan and the
kids at some point.

38:28.334 --> 38:30.567
No, I wasn't.

38:30.667 --> 38:33.025
For what it's worth, Nate,
I don't hate you.

38:33.125 --> 38:35.899
You're just too pathetic.

38:35.999 --> 38:38.999
It doesn't matter anyway,
it's gonna be over in,
like, a second.

38:43.918 --> 38:46.275
What happened?
Why am I in jail?

38:46.375 --> 38:48.292
I don't know,
why don't you ask your wife?

38:51.999 --> 38:55.899
- What's so funny?
- You'll never know.

38:55.999 --> 38:58.899
A little friendly advice:
Don't ask any questions,

38:58.999 --> 39:02.025
don't call Paige, and walk
away as fast as you can.

39:02.125 --> 39:03.899
Is that a threat?

39:03.999 --> 39:07.000
Actually, Nate, it is.

39:17.999 --> 39:19.734
I'm sorry, Mr. Dean,

39:19.834 --> 39:21.899
if we don't leave very soon,
you'll miss your meeting.

39:21.999 --> 39:24.250
I know, I know.

39:29.626 --> 39:32.651
- Jason!
- Phoebe!

39:32.751 --> 39:36.234
Wow, you're cutting it
pretty close, aren't you?

39:36.334 --> 39:37.959
Where are your bags?

39:39.000 --> 39:41.999
- Jason...
- You're not coming, are you?

39:43.209 --> 39:44.501
No, I'm not.

39:45.999 --> 39:48.651
I want to.
More than you know.

39:48.751 --> 39:49.900
Well, then why don't you?

39:50.000 --> 39:51.626
Uh....

39:52.792 --> 39:56.025
It's hard to explain.

39:56.125 --> 40:00.234
I just feel like,
for now at least,

40:00.334 --> 40:04.484
that my place is here, you know?
That this is where I need to be.

40:04.584 --> 40:08.999
Not forever. I mean,
God, I hope not forever.

40:10.667 --> 40:12.899
Just for now.

40:12.999 --> 40:15.459
I guess I should've gotten
you jewelry after all.

40:29.999 --> 40:31.999
Hurry back.

41:04.959 --> 41:07.359
I think he looks a little
like your grandfather.

41:07.459 --> 41:09.567
Oh, trust me,
that's a good thing.

41:09.667 --> 41:12.292
- He was a good man.
- Nice to know.

41:13.417 --> 41:16.109
Shall we?

41:16.209 --> 41:19.526
I call forth
from space and time

41:19.626 --> 41:21.776
Matriarchs from
the Halliwell line

41:21.876 --> 41:24.900
Mothers, daughters,
sisters, friends

41:25.000 --> 41:28.150
Our family spirit without end

41:28.250 --> 41:32.275
To gather now
in this sacred place

41:32.375 --> 41:36.042
And help us bring
this child to grace

41:47.375 --> 41:51.442
The next generation has
been born into our family.

41:51.542 --> 41:53.167
Our legacy.

42:10.792 --> 42:15.484
We pledge to be with this child,
this beautiful boy, always.

42:15.584 --> 42:19.192
Apart but never separate,
free but never alone.

42:19.292 --> 42:22.067
He is one of us,
and because of that,

42:22.167 --> 42:25.818
we will bless him with
all the goodness that we are.

42:25.918 --> 42:30.999
Welcome to the family,
Wyatt Matthew Halliwell.

42:32.959 --> 42:35.192
- Blessed be.
- ALL: Blessed be.

42:35.292 --> 42:36.999
- LEO AND PIPER: Blessed be.
- PHOEBE AND PAIGE: Blessed be.

42:44.626 --> 42:46.667
Take good care
of my great-grandson.
