Previously on "the secret life
of the american teenager"...

00:02.770 --> 00:06.682
I can't imagine not seeing you every
day, being with you through all this.

00:06.717 --> 00:09.296
I wanna do this all alone.
I'm going to my grandmother's.

00:09.331 --> 00:11.875
I don't wanna say goodbye
because I don't want you to leave.

00:11.910 --> 00:14.195
How can you be angry
with a guy who loves you

00:14.196 --> 00:16.340
despite the fact that you're
pregnant by another guy?

00:16.375 --> 00:18.485
Are you seeing adrian's
mother? You're the boyfriend?

00:18.520 --> 00:20.425
You stay away from my
daughter and you keep

00:20.426 --> 00:22.330
your mouth shut about
me and adrian's mom.

00:22.365 --> 00:26.506
We're not friends because
your boyfriend and I hooked up.

00:26.541 --> 00:27.363
I've forgiven him.

00:27.398 --> 00:28.631
What do you even want to talk about?

00:28.666 --> 00:30.517
I think I do wanna be involved.

00:30.552 --> 00:32.334
Don't even know why I did this.

00:32.369 --> 00:34.593
Maybe it's because I asked
if you wanted to be friends.

00:34.628 --> 00:35.845
You need me around here!

00:35.880 --> 00:37.766
I'm not so sure that I
want to fix our marriage.

00:37.801 --> 00:39.840
Perfectly capable of
speaking for myself!

00:39.875 --> 00:40.642
Since when?

00:40.677 --> 00:42.556
Since I discovered
that I am going to have

00:42.557 --> 00:44.436
to take charge of another
human being's life!

00:44.471 --> 00:46.976
I might as well just start with my own.

01:01.209 --> 01:02.961
Mimsy!

01:02.996 --> 01:05.000
Oh, amy. Ohh.

01:05.824 --> 01:07.284
Honey. Ohh.

01:09.769 --> 01:12.121
Good morning, sweet pea.

01:12.156 --> 01:15.457
- Morning.
- I was talking to the baby.

01:16.094 --> 01:19.517
Oh, please, now, no shame.
Not a moment of shame.

01:19.552 --> 01:22.293
Not with me, because
I am so proud of you.

01:22.328 --> 01:25.657
You are a wonderful girl.
You are a wonderful girl.

01:25.692 --> 01:28.951
So you're going to have a baby.
So what? Who cares?

01:28.986 --> 01:33.028
Life must have wanted another
beautiful creature on this planet.

01:33.063 --> 01:34.771
Who knows life's plan?

01:34.806 --> 01:36.380
We don't know how this
is all gonna turn out,

01:36.415 --> 01:39.288
whether it's gonna be a good thing or
a bad thing, so don't worry about it.

01:39.323 --> 01:41.250
Not a bit.

01:41.646 --> 01:45.282
Oh, and thank you. Thank you for
letting your mother call me and tell me.

01:45.317 --> 01:48.508
Oh, no, mimsy, thank you so much
for letting me stay with you.

01:48.543 --> 01:50.832
- mom?
- Oh, hi.

01:51.473 --> 01:55.325
Um, I got up at four and rushed down
here 'cause I couldn't wait to see my amy.

01:55.360 --> 01:57.366
But I thought I was
gonna drive amy up to you.

01:57.401 --> 02:01.530
Well, I'm not a planner. You know
I'm not a planner. Neither are you.

02:01.565 --> 02:05.660
And neither are you. Obviously
you take after your mother and me.

02:05.695 --> 02:08.352
- What's going on?
- Ashley.

02:08.387 --> 02:10.973
- Hey, mimsy.
- Little ashley.

02:11.008 --> 02:14.660
I didn't know you were coming,
but no one tells me anything.

02:14.695 --> 02:17.112
If anyone had told me
that someone in the family

02:17.147 --> 02:20.694
was gonna be pregnant as a teenager,
I would have said it was you.

02:20.729 --> 02:22.999
Yeah, well, um, is that bacon?

02:23.034 --> 02:25.520
Yes, it is. The real thing. Thick cut.

02:25.555 --> 02:27.532
I brought it from home
just for your father.

02:27.567 --> 02:29.041
Where is he?

02:30.781 --> 02:32.936
Um, I-I told you. They
don't tell me anything.

02:32.971 --> 02:37.135
Uh, he had to go to a furniture
thing, um, in north carolina.

02:37.170 --> 02:39.055
North carolina?

02:39.493 --> 02:42.811
Like george ever bought
furniture made in this country.

02:42.846 --> 02:44.654
Come on. Where is he?

02:44.689 --> 02:46.427
In north carolina.

02:46.462 --> 02:49.731
He buys a lot of furniture
in north carolina, mother.

02:49.766 --> 02:53.000
But he should be back by
tonight if you can stay.

02:53.335 --> 02:56.194
Oh, sure. We can take
off in the morning, right?

02:56.229 --> 02:57.618
I guess.

02:57.653 --> 03:00.262
Tomorrow? Can't you
stay for, like, a week?

03:00.297 --> 03:03.603
- A week?
- Ashley, your grandmother -

03:03.638 --> 03:05.879
Uh, no g-word, dear.

03:06.220 --> 03:08.720
Mimsy doesn't have her
things to stay for a week.

03:08.755 --> 03:10.490
Probably not even for a night.

03:10.525 --> 03:12.709
You know, why not?

03:12.744 --> 03:14.972
We can pick up some things at the mall,

03:15.007 --> 03:17.165
and then we'll go
during the school hours

03:17.200 --> 03:21.232
so that you won't run into any
of those stupid teenage girls.

03:21.267 --> 03:22.525
I guess.

03:22.560 --> 03:25.616
Mom, the thing is is amy's already
said goodbye to her friends,

03:25.617 --> 03:28.672
and I think she really wanted
to get out of here today.

03:28.707 --> 03:31.616
She didn't say goodbye
to milli and vanilli.

03:32.881 --> 03:36.301
So how are madison and lauren?

03:36.336 --> 03:37.828
I said goodbye to them.

03:37.863 --> 03:41.258
- No, you didn't, not in person.
- Did too.

03:41.312 --> 03:45.051
You know, you're acting very
strange, and you're not a good liar.

03:45.086 --> 03:48.273
So, come on, come on, give
me the straight poop now.

03:48.308 --> 03:51.461
- You and george are not...
- No, we're not. We're fine.

03:51.496 --> 03:52.604
We're very happy.

03:52.639 --> 03:58.586
But we'll all be a lot happier when
he gets back from... North carolina.

04:28.040 --> 04:30.031
Get over here.

06:09.908 --> 06:14.515
hey, you! Snap out of it. Daydreamin'?

06:17.067 --> 06:19.579
Visual realization.

06:29.698 --> 06:31.371
How's it goin'?

06:31.764 --> 06:33.372
I see her everywhere I look.

06:33.407 --> 06:35.992
Then stop looking for
her everywhere you look.

06:36.027 --> 06:36.911
how?

06:36.946 --> 06:40.186
Just stop, otherwise you're
gonna make yourself miserable.

06:40.221 --> 06:42.506
I am miserable.

06:43.483 --> 06:45.095
Get used to it.

06:45.167 --> 06:48.153
That's what love feels like misery.

06:48.188 --> 06:50.063
No, it's the absence of love.

06:50.098 --> 06:53.445
That's what the absence
of love feels like. Misery.

06:53.480 --> 06:55.487
You wanna start focusing
on something else?

06:55.522 --> 06:57.085
Like...?

06:57.120 --> 07:02.039
Like school. Don't forget you came here to
get an education. Focus on your education.

07:02.074 --> 07:04.419
It's an interesting idea.

07:05.264 --> 07:08.131
But I can't focus on anything but amy,

07:08.570 --> 07:12.941
every second of every minute
of every hour of every day.

07:12.976 --> 07:15.805
What's the point in
doing that to yourself?

07:16.178 --> 07:18.366
And don't say you can't
help it. You can help it.

07:18.401 --> 07:21.543
Right. Only I...

07:21.578 --> 07:26.781
I think that if I keep picturing her,
then... She'll maybe show up here again.

07:27.225 --> 07:29.886
And that could happen. I mean,
she could come back to school.

07:29.921 --> 07:33.932
Ben, she could come back,
but most girls like amy go

07:33.967 --> 07:37.944
into a continuation program,
where they go to smaller

07:37.945 --> 07:41.023
classes at another school
with other girls having babies.

07:41.058 --> 07:44.102
So even if she decided to
stay at home with her parents,

07:44.103 --> 07:47.131
more than likely she'd go
into the continuation program.

07:47.166 --> 07:49.304
It's not likely that
she'd come back here.

07:49.339 --> 07:52.365
He gets to come to school every
day as if nothing happened.

07:52.400 --> 07:55.442
- That's right.
- No, that's wrong.

07:55.477 --> 07:58.021
That's just... It's wrong.

07:58.056 --> 08:02.105
Would you just focus on something else?
You have to focus on something else.

08:02.140 --> 08:04.347
Choose what you think about,
and don't think about amy

08:04.382 --> 08:07.467
every second of every
hour of every day.

08:07.502 --> 08:09.548
You'll go crazy.

08:09.865 --> 08:11.906
That's odd. You just sound crazy.

08:11.941 --> 08:14.652
She's not coming back
to school here, ben.

08:14.687 --> 08:17.511
Wow. Insensitive, don't you think?

08:17.709 --> 08:19.283
Truthful.

08:19.318 --> 08:24.463
Yeah, but what is the truth? I
mean, the truth is, it could happen.

08:24.498 --> 08:27.110
She could come back to school.

08:27.822 --> 08:30.586
Ben... ben!

08:33.399 --> 08:35.111
I'm sorry.

08:35.823 --> 08:39.096
I just hate to see you do this to
yourself your first year of high school.

08:39.335 --> 08:41.159
And what are you doing to yourself?

08:41.195 --> 08:44.008
You have anyone in your
life, or are you just

08:44.009 --> 08:46.786
too scared of being
miserable to get involved?

08:46.821 --> 08:51.903
Well, I'd rather be miserable
and involved. That's just me.

08:54.368 --> 08:57.048
Great. That went great.

08:59.313 --> 09:02.174
Look, I'm sorry I haven't
called. I've been really

09:02.175 --> 09:05.615
busy lately, learnin'
about babies and stuff.

09:05.650 --> 09:09.021
- Me. Can you imagine?
- Nope. I can't imagine.

09:09.056 --> 09:12.904
But if you wanna come over, i'll
remind you of where babies come from.

09:12.939 --> 09:17.421
I know you don't take my problems
seriously, but I care about this baby.

09:17.456 --> 09:21.903
Or, do you just think you should
care, so you're acting as if you care?

09:21.938 --> 09:25.105
- What's the difference?
- Exactly.

09:27.958 --> 09:31.236
Look, ricky, if you're
gonna be involved with amy

09:31.237 --> 09:34.515
and the baby, I don't
think I can see you anymore.

09:34.550 --> 09:37.956
- Why not?
- Because I don't want to.

09:38.800 --> 09:41.261
Grace! Hi.

09:41.922 --> 09:44.785
Hi, adrian. Hi, ricky.

09:45.493 --> 09:47.821
So, um, thanks for
letting me come by your

09:47.822 --> 09:50.149
house the other night.
I had a really nice time.

09:50.184 --> 09:51.795
Oh, me too.

09:51.967 --> 09:54.965
Oh, did you know that
grace and I are friends now?

09:55.000 --> 09:58.553
No, I didn't. Grace and I are
friends, too. Aren't we, grace?

09:58.588 --> 10:01.396
- We're all friends, aren't we?
- Yeah.

10:01.846 --> 10:06.915
And as of right now,
that's all we are. Friends.

10:07.220 --> 10:10.620
- Bye, grace.
- bye.

10:13.607 --> 10:16.209
She's just upset because I've
decided to do the responsible

10:16.210 --> 10:18.776
thing and be more involved
with amy and the baby.

10:18.811 --> 10:21.547
Oh, I didn't know. I heard she
wasn't coming back to school.

10:21.582 --> 10:26.574
Yeah, she's... Goin' to her grandmother's.
She's runnin' away like a child.

10:26.609 --> 10:28.967
I mean, it might be a
good time to grow up.

10:29.002 --> 10:31.358
There are schools for girls like her.

10:31.393 --> 10:34.383
I guess it's just a little harder for
her to come to school than you because

10:34.384 --> 10:37.373
soon people are gonna be able to look
at her and just tell that she's pregnant.

10:37.408 --> 10:41.855
- People are lookin' at me, too.
- Yeah, I guess they are. Maybe.

10:41.890 --> 10:44.138
Well, it just goes with the territory.

10:44.173 --> 10:46.352
We did something we shouldn't have,

10:46.387 --> 10:49.897
and now we're both havin'
to suffer the consequences.

10:49.932 --> 10:53.408
Yes. I just hope the baby
isn't paying the consequences.

10:53.443 --> 10:55.848
Is she planning on keeping the baby?

10:56.229 --> 10:59.746
I hope so, but I think she's
leaning toward adoption.

10:59.781 --> 11:02.847
That's good. Don't you think?

11:02.882 --> 11:06.222
I don't know. I don't know
what it's like to be adopted.

11:06.257 --> 11:09.642
- Ricky, I'm sorry.
- That's ok.

11:09.944 --> 11:12.460
Look, you think I can come
over tonight and talk to ya?

11:12.495 --> 11:14.210
I really need someone
to talk to about this,

11:14.245 --> 11:17.916
someone who's not so
emotionally involved, you know?

11:17.951 --> 11:19.531
I don't know.

11:19.566 --> 11:21.428
Are you seeing jack again?

11:21.463 --> 11:25.105
Not really. I guess
we're just friends, too.

11:25.693 --> 11:27.181
He hasn't called, so...

11:27.216 --> 11:29.506
You want some advice from a friend?

11:29.541 --> 11:31.560
Just forget about that guy.

11:31.595 --> 11:34.066
- Because...?
- Because you deserve better.

11:34.101 --> 11:38.581
I'm not saying that I'm better, but
there's better out there, better than jack.

11:41.188 --> 11:43.920
Excuse me for just a second. I
have to ask amy's friend something.

11:45.142 --> 11:47.776
- Hey, it's madison, right?
- What do you want?

11:47.811 --> 11:51.409
- And if it's sex, forget it.
- No, but thank you for offering.

11:51.444 --> 11:53.704
Is that what you consider an offer?

11:53.739 --> 11:57.117
I just wanted to know if amy's
left for her grandmother's yet.

11:57.152 --> 11:59.666
Well, I can neither
confirm or deny that.

11:59.701 --> 12:01.812
What, are you runnin'
for office or something?

12:01.847 --> 12:04.122
I know what's goin' on. I know
she's goin' to her grandmother's.

12:04.157 --> 12:07.806
I just don't know if she's there yet.
I'd like to call her. I need her number.

12:07.841 --> 12:09.211
Well, I'm not gonna
give you her number.

12:09.246 --> 12:12.848
If amy wanted you to have her number,
she would have given you her number.

12:12.883 --> 12:16.299
And you don't have it, so she
obviously doesn't want you to call her.

12:16.334 --> 12:18.380
Obviously.

12:19.107 --> 12:22.526
- wow.
- Wow? Wow what?

12:22.561 --> 12:25.570
You have incredible
eyes, you know that?

12:26.040 --> 12:28.219
Thank you.

12:29.217 --> 12:31.657
Come on, let me have the number.

12:31.692 --> 12:36.097
No. I will not let you have her number.

12:39.506 --> 12:41.570
You will not believe
what just happened.

12:41.605 --> 12:44.852
- What happened?
- Ricky just tried to seduce me.

12:44.887 --> 12:47.116
- That's funny.
- Why is that funny?

12:47.151 --> 12:49.089
- Come on.
- What?

12:49.124 --> 12:52.098
- Why would he try to seduce you?
- Oh, to get amy's number.

12:52.133 --> 12:55.540
You think he would try to get you to sleep
with him just to get a number out of you?

12:55.575 --> 12:57.672
He slept with amy. Why wouldn't
he want to sleep with me?

12:57.707 --> 13:00.032
- That's not the issue.
- Well, what is the issue?

13:00.067 --> 13:02.358
The issue is... Well, I
don't really know what the

13:02.359 --> 13:05.139
issue is, but I just don't
think he would do that.

13:05.174 --> 13:08.029
- Well, why not?
- why?

13:08.064 --> 13:10.473
You're just jealous that he
wanted to seduce me and not you.

13:10.508 --> 13:13.106
What? No. I'm sure he
didn't ask me for her number

13:13.141 --> 13:14.803
because he knew I
wouldn't give it to him.

13:14.838 --> 13:16.338
Oh, because you're too smart?

13:16.373 --> 13:18.941
- I didn't say that.
- Yeah, well, you're thinking it.

13:18.976 --> 13:20.506
You think you're smarter
than me, don't you?

13:20.541 --> 13:23.082
Well, you think you're
sexier than me, don't you?

13:23.117 --> 13:25.624
I have amy's number,
too, so I don't know why

13:25.625 --> 13:27.768
he would try to seduce
you and not seduce me.

13:27.803 --> 13:31.516
- Well, it's just what happened.
- Well, we'll see about that.

13:56.885 --> 13:59.712
hi. What's up?

14:00.266 --> 14:02.442
You wanna open that door?

14:02.477 --> 14:05.837
Don't get nervous.
I just wanna talk to you.

14:05.872 --> 14:09.869
I'm not nervous. School
policy. Why would I be nervous?

14:09.904 --> 14:12.166
It's personal, ok?

14:12.201 --> 14:15.456
I don't want anyone
hearing what I have to say.

14:15.491 --> 14:21.399
- I can talk to you, right?
- Right. Just like any other student.

14:22.034 --> 14:25.793
Ok. Well, I need some help.

14:26.271 --> 14:28.187
ok.

14:29.744 --> 14:32.789
I wanna find my father.
I wanna know who he is.

14:32.824 --> 14:33.763
You have a name?

14:33.798 --> 14:35.910
If I had a name, then I'd
just go on the internet.

14:35.945 --> 14:40.459
- Your mother knows who he is?
- Well, I would hope so.

14:40.919 --> 14:43.707
- I don't know, ok?
- Have you ever asked her?

14:43.742 --> 14:46.125
- No.
- Could you ask her?

14:46.160 --> 14:49.553
I don't wanna ask her. I
wanna do this on my own.

14:49.588 --> 14:52.746
Be a lot easier if you had a name.

14:52.982 --> 14:56.880
Is that what you're looking for? Easy?

14:56.915 --> 15:01.147
No, no, no. Whoa. Don't
start that stuff with me, ok?

15:01.792 --> 15:05.612
I'm not interested in high school
girls, not even one as smart as you.

15:05.647 --> 15:09.125
- Really?
- Really.

15:13.148 --> 15:17.401
You're gonna be late for class.
Lemme do some research.

16:04.148 --> 16:07.516
- ben, Where's your lunch?
- I don't feel like eating.

16:07.551 --> 16:12.050
You have to eat, ben. You can't just
wait to eat till you see amy again.

16:12.085 --> 16:13.880
I see her everywhere I look.

16:13.915 --> 16:16.861
The solution for that
may be to go blind.

16:16.896 --> 16:21.114
I know a great way to go blind.
Ah, I knew I could make you laugh.

16:21.149 --> 16:23.098
I don't get it.

16:23.910 --> 16:26.985
Uh... I'll let you take this one.

16:27.487 --> 16:30.110
You know, loving yourself.
In a physical way.

16:30.145 --> 16:32.734
Masturbation. That
won't make you go blind.

16:32.769 --> 16:33.719
It was just a joke.

16:33.754 --> 16:35.832
It's just an old wives'
tale. It's not even funny.

16:35.867 --> 16:37.875
- It made him laugh.
- It didn't make me laugh.

16:37.910 --> 16:42.102
That's because you don't engage
in any eye-damaging activities.

16:42.137 --> 16:44.211
According to the
encyclopedia britannica,

16:44.246 --> 16:48.072
92% of men masturbate and
between 70-80% of girls.

16:48.107 --> 16:49.688
- Girls?
- Girls?

16:49.723 --> 16:52.996
Yeah. Please.

16:53.614 --> 16:56.870
You-you think girls don't do that.

16:57.541 --> 16:59.894
Well, you don't.

16:59.929 --> 17:02.478
I think I'll skip lunch
and go study somewhere.

17:02.479 --> 17:05.027
I have an algebra test tomorrow. Bye.

17:06.866 --> 17:08.996
So she has sex with
herself but not with me?

17:09.031 --> 17:12.016
Whoa, be careful. You don't wanna
slip into a double standard here.

17:12.050 --> 17:16.367
I feel like I just found
out that... Alice cheated.

17:16.402 --> 17:19.638
You feel like your girlfriend cheated?
Oh, come on, please.

17:19.674 --> 17:22.877
At least you know who you're
competing against... The drummer.

17:22.912 --> 17:27.276
But... Who do you think
alice is attracted to?

17:27.310 --> 17:31.089
Who do you think she's fantasizing
about? Who is she having sex with?

17:31.124 --> 17:32.900
- You don't wanna know that.
- Oh, yes, I do.

17:32.935 --> 17:35.170
No, you don't.

17:35.205 --> 17:38.654
I bet it's that stupid
justin timberlake.

17:38.689 --> 17:41.476
Don't go down this road. Don't.

17:41.511 --> 17:43.553
I'll see ya.

17:53.632 --> 17:55.353
Can I ask you something?

17:55.388 --> 17:59.272
Sure. But I already have a girlfriend.

18:01.789 --> 18:04.754
Do you mind? It's personal.

18:04.789 --> 18:07.720
All right, you guys. Move it.

18:13.601 --> 18:17.084
Do you have any idea of how I could
get a copy of my birth certificate?

18:17.119 --> 18:19.861
Uh, there's probably a copy
in your permanent record.

18:19.896 --> 18:23.344
You know, when you entered
school. Kindergarten?

18:23.549 --> 18:28.580
- Thanks.
- Wait. Wait. I charge for this stuff.

18:35.651 --> 18:37.841
I'm all outta cash.

18:47.581 --> 18:50.167
Are you that desperate to get ricky?

18:50.202 --> 18:54.462
I am not desperate. You are
desperate. I can get any guy I want.

18:54.497 --> 18:57.909
Yeah, well, I bet I could get a boyfriend
before you could get a boyfriend.

18:57.944 --> 19:01.287
Really? 'cause you look like a tragic
teen star in her declining years.

19:01.322 --> 19:06.085
Oh, excuse me, janet. It looks like you're
about to have a wardrobe malfunction.

19:06.120 --> 19:10.489
- Is that some kind of racist remark?
- Oh, so now I'm a racist.

19:10.524 --> 19:12.706
Hey, ricky.

19:13.119 --> 19:14.993
- hi.
- hi.

19:15.028 --> 19:18.367
Just so you know, i'm not gonna give
you amy's cell phone number, either.

19:18.402 --> 19:20.485
- All right.
- Just so you know.

19:20.520 --> 19:22.856
Yeah, I didn't think you
would. That's why I didn't ask.

19:22.891 --> 19:26.854
Yeah, I guess you know
that I'm smarter than that.

19:26.889 --> 19:30.817
No, you're just more
difficult than that. Than her.

19:31.279 --> 19:32.423
No, I'm not.

19:32.458 --> 19:35.947
Hey, don't apologize. I like
difficult women. I like a challenge.

19:35.982 --> 19:39.858
Yeah? Well, I am a challenge.

19:40.847 --> 19:44.834
Hey, if I give you my cell number, would
you give it to amy and ask her to call me?

19:44.869 --> 19:46.658
I don't think she
has my number, either.

19:46.693 --> 19:49.837
Yeah. I guess I could do that.

20:09.604 --> 20:12.518
Hang on a sec. You have a
copy of my birth certificate.

20:12.553 --> 20:15.563
What? No. But I know how to get a copy.

20:15.598 --> 20:18.296
All you have to do is fill out
a form and get it notarized.

20:18.297 --> 20:20.994
It's real easy. I'll give you a
website. It's a very simple process.

20:21.029 --> 20:24.660
- I know all about the website.
- Then what's the problem?

20:24.695 --> 20:28.292
Did you read the fine print?
It takes four months to get it.

20:28.327 --> 20:30.232
Look, there's a copy
of my birth certificate

20:30.233 --> 20:32.173
in my permanent record, isn't there?

20:32.208 --> 20:33.589
Four months isn't that long.

20:33.624 --> 20:37.081
oh, come on. If you have a copy of my
birth certificate, just give it to me.

20:37.116 --> 20:40.729
- Can't.
- You could if you wanted to.

21:04.920 --> 21:08.735
Hello. I'm sorry, I can't hear you.

21:08.770 --> 21:12.378
- Cindy, is that you?
- Cindy? Cindy who?

21:12.769 --> 21:15.248
Uh, cindy. Cindy lou.

21:15.283 --> 21:18.667
I told you I'd call you
when the bunk beds got in.

21:18.702 --> 21:21.232
I know you wanted to surprise
little tommy for his birthday,

21:21.267 --> 21:23.552
but... I don't think
they'll be here in time.

21:23.587 --> 21:24.902
- George...
- You know what?

21:24.937 --> 21:29.219
Get that kid a puppy. That's what he
really wants. Got a customer. Gotta go.

21:36.733 --> 21:38.908
- hi.
- Hi. It's me.

21:38.943 --> 21:41.048
- Me who?
- George.

21:41.083 --> 21:44.164
Anne, is that you? Why you whispering?

21:44.199 --> 21:47.297
- Because my mom's here.
- Mimsy? Really? She wanna see me?

21:47.332 --> 21:49.331
She doesn't know
you're not living here.

21:49.366 --> 21:51.330
I told her that you're
in north carolina.

21:51.365 --> 21:52.239
That's just great.

21:52.274 --> 21:55.182
<i>So don't drop by here until I've
called and told you she's left.</i>

21:55.217 --> 21:58.055
So you'll let me know when your
mother's taken our daughter away?

21:58.090 --> 22:01.774
Gimme a break. She's gonna be two hours
away. You can visit her anytime you want.

22:01.809 --> 22:05.085
Yeah, when I get back
from north carolina.

22:29.354 --> 22:31.619
Hey, it's me.

22:32.147 --> 22:34.043
You know I hate to ask, but...

22:35.163 --> 22:37.659
I really need someone to talk to.

22:38.475 --> 22:40.707
- hi.
- hi.

22:40.742 --> 22:44.428
So, did dad get back
from north carolina yet?

22:44.463 --> 22:46.864
I don't wanna tell her, ok?

22:51.990 --> 22:54.702
ta-da. You rember this one?

22:54.737 --> 22:57.367
- That's mine, isn't it?
- Mimsy brought it for me.

22:57.402 --> 23:00.388
She said she has a lot of
your stuff that might fit.

23:00.423 --> 23:03.374
I didn't know that you saved
that. I loved that sweater.

23:03.409 --> 23:05.660
Me too. Do you rember when you wore it?

23:05.695 --> 23:09.720
Well, I don't remember if it was a
special occasion, but I wore it a lot.

23:09.755 --> 23:10.903
It was a long time ago.

23:10.938 --> 23:13.656
You wore it when you
were pregnant with amy.

23:13.691 --> 23:16.217
No, I don't think so. I
think I was in junior high.

23:16.252 --> 23:21.326
No. I remember you were wearing it
when you told me that you were pregnant.

23:21.361 --> 23:24.307
Really? I had that in college?

23:24.342 --> 23:28.883
I distinctly rember because I told you,

23:28.884 --> 23:33.424
as I've told amy, that
adoption is not an option.

23:33.827 --> 23:37.671
You know, we're a big family.
We can take care of this baby.

23:37.706 --> 23:41.116
You and george and
me and even ashley...

23:41.151 --> 23:44.618
- We can take care of the baby.
- Well, mom, I don't know about that.

23:44.653 --> 23:46.412
Ok, we still have lots of time to think

23:46.413 --> 23:48.206
about what's right for
amy and for the baby.

23:48.255 --> 23:51.219
Oh, well, we don't need any
more time. Amy and I have decide.

23:51.220 --> 23:54.184
We don't want adoption.
We wanna keep the baby.

23:54.701 --> 23:58.200
Amy, let's think about it, ok? There's
still plenty of time to think about that.

23:58.235 --> 24:03.707
No, mom, this is my baby. And,
you know, I wanna keep her or him.

24:03.742 --> 24:07.080
And mimsy definitely
agrees that ben and I should

24:07.081 --> 24:10.453
get married and possibly
go on a honeymoon to paris?

24:10.488 --> 24:13.196
A little wedding gift from mimsy.

24:13.231 --> 24:15.870
- What?
- Well, he's a good boy.

24:15.905 --> 24:20.931
You haven't even met him. He's 15 years
old, just like amy. They're both 15.

24:20.966 --> 24:25.200
- Oh, who cares how old they are?
- I do. And so does george.

24:25.235 --> 24:27.232
Well, george always
agrees with me, so we'll

24:27.233 --> 24:29.229
wait till he gets home,
and I'll talk with him.

24:29.264 --> 24:35.239
You know, this house is plenty big enough
for one more, and a baby is very tiny.

24:35.674 --> 24:38.081
I mean, you only weighed 3 pounds.

24:38.116 --> 24:41.356
No. I weighed 7 pounds, 4 ounces.

24:41.391 --> 24:44.596
You were tiny. You were very tiny.

24:45.276 --> 24:49.996
Tsk, now, amy, the
baby can stay in here

24:50.221 --> 24:53.555
for the first year or
two, and then, after that,

24:53.590 --> 24:56.890
we'll find something bigger,
like a dresser drawer.

25:04.386 --> 25:08.746
Ashley, can you call your
dad to see if he's landed yet?

25:09.999 --> 25:11.990
I don't know why I did it.

25:12.750 --> 25:18.747
I've been married for 15 years.
She's need me for the past 15 years.

25:19.827 --> 25:24.602
She doesn't need me anymore.
She doesn't even like me anymore.

25:25.475 --> 25:27.443
Ignore that.

25:29.091 --> 25:31.310
I'm an attractive guy, don't you think?

25:31.980 --> 25:36.802
I'm smart, funny. I mean,
why can't she see that?

25:37.303 --> 25:41.411
That's a lot to see. Maybe
too much for the eyes.

25:41.446 --> 25:43.530
That's true.

25:47.152 --> 25:49.410
- So you still with that guy?
- How long have I worked here?

25:49.445 --> 25:50.146
Years.

25:50.181 --> 25:52.320
And you don't know i'm
still with that guy?

25:52.355 --> 25:53.472
no.

25:53.507 --> 25:56.185
Yes, I'm still with that guy.

25:56.220 --> 26:00.742
His name is leon, and we're
married, happily married.

26:00.777 --> 26:02.705
10 years.

26:03.222 --> 26:05.554
I didn't know that. Is that legal?

26:05.589 --> 26:08.501
A marriage is more than a piece of
paper, george. It's a commitment.

26:08.536 --> 26:10.734
I know that.

26:10.769 --> 26:14.090
So, you never...?

26:14.529 --> 26:18.104
No. He never did, either.

26:19.457 --> 26:22.787
We have a guest room.
It's all yours if you want it.

26:23.392 --> 26:25.796
Oh, thanks, I'm fine.

26:25.831 --> 26:27.466
Short commute.

26:27.501 --> 26:32.636
In that case, I set the
alarm for 7:00. Good night.

27:17.341 --> 27:19.745
- Maybe I should be going.
- You just got here.

27:19.780 --> 27:21.486
Yeah, you just got here.

27:21.521 --> 27:25.603
I'm just not comfortable talking
with... A third person listening in.

27:25.638 --> 27:30.298
- No offense.
- Why don't you leave us alone, grace?

27:30.333 --> 27:34.231
Ok. I know you wanted to talk to ricky.

27:39.157 --> 27:43.314
Women. Huh, you can't live with them.

27:43.349 --> 27:45.625
Can't live without 'em, yeah.

27:45.660 --> 27:47.959
Is that what you wanted to
talk to me about... women?

27:47.994 --> 27:51.250
- Yeah. My mother.
- Your mother.

27:51.285 --> 27:54.581
- She was old.
- She's not that old.

27:54.616 --> 27:57.877
And between you and
me, she's kinda hot.

27:57.912 --> 28:01.479
- You are confused.
- I'm confused?

28:01.514 --> 28:03.528
I am adopted.

28:04.286 --> 28:07.536
My mom died.

28:22.928 --> 28:24.792
Go away.

28:25.456 --> 28:27.183
It's me.

28:29.368 --> 28:34.652
I just wanted to come and say
goodbye in person. See mimsy.

28:37.169 --> 28:41.221
Don't cry. It's gonna be ok, all right?

28:42.892 --> 28:45.721
You look, uh, different.

28:46.909 --> 28:49.201
Oh, I look like a slut, don't i?

28:49.539 --> 28:53.561
I am a slut. Lauren and I got
in a fight today at school.

28:53.596 --> 28:55.355
Over...?

28:56.231 --> 28:58.044
Ricky.

28:58.496 --> 29:00.525
Wait. Ricky? What?

29:00.750 --> 29:03.781
Well, it all started when
ricky tried to seduce me.

29:03.816 --> 29:06.059
- Ricky.
- Hello? He seduced you.

29:06.094 --> 29:08.268
Why wouldn't he try to seduce me?

29:08.303 --> 29:10.125
Wait, ricky's hitting
on you and lauren now?

29:10.160 --> 29:13.878
Well, not lauren. Although
that would make her very happy.

29:13.913 --> 29:16.103
I don't understand. Lauren
wants to go out with him?

29:16.138 --> 29:18.120
Well, not really.

29:18.155 --> 29:21.621
Ok, but you're dressed like this
because you wanna go out with ricky?

29:21.656 --> 29:25.100
Ok, I'm over it. It was
just temporary insanity.

29:25.135 --> 29:28.166
Lauren and I both wanted him to
want us. And not the both of us.

29:28.201 --> 29:31.197
Like, I wanted him to want me,
lauren wanted him to want her.

29:31.232 --> 29:34.699
Just got into this stupid competion.

29:35.752 --> 29:40.531
I don't know why I would want a guy to want
me when I know he's such a horrible guy.

29:40.566 --> 29:45.670
I understand. Believe me,
I completely understand.

29:46.103 --> 29:49.366
It's kinda how this
whole thing happened.

29:50.935 --> 29:56.439
I knew it was wrong, I knew
he was wrong, and yet, i, uh...

29:56.712 --> 29:58.662
And yet...

30:01.078 --> 30:01.913
Where's lauren?

30:01.948 --> 30:05.152
Her parents still won't let
her come over here, so...

30:05.187 --> 30:09.678
I figure she'll probably give you
a call after she figures I've left.

30:12.847 --> 30:17.390
You're gonna call me, right, every day?

30:19.502 --> 30:23.322
Please don't cry, amy. I know
you're sad about leaving, but just...

30:23.357 --> 30:25.159
Please don't cry.

30:25.194 --> 30:28.829
Madison, I'm not sad because of that.

30:29.992 --> 30:34.433
I'm sad because I have no place to go.

30:35.106 --> 30:37.168
Sorry.

30:40.441 --> 30:44.770
Mm. It's lauren. She
probably wants to say goodbye.

30:46.920 --> 30:51.282
- hey.
- Hi. Amy? I thought I called madison.

30:51.317 --> 30:55.749
- Are you at mimsy's?
- No. There's been a little complication.

30:56.976 --> 30:59.679
- Oh. Are you ok?
- Not really.

30:59.714 --> 31:00.981
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

31:01.016 --> 31:03.543
And I'm sorry my parents
won't let me come over there.

31:03.578 --> 31:05.761
Yeah, me too.

31:07.054 --> 31:09.042
Uh, madison said you
guys were in a fight?

31:09.077 --> 31:12.119
Yeah. We're both stupid.

31:12.569 --> 31:15.192
- I'm so sorry.
- So am i.

31:15.227 --> 31:18.420
<i>We should never let a guy that we
don't even like come between us.</i>

31:18.455 --> 31:20.703
Even guys we do want.

31:20.932 --> 31:24.520
Well, unless he's, like,
a really hot celebrity.

31:24.555 --> 31:25.687
Madison.

31:25.722 --> 31:29.774
It's an extreme case that would
never happen. Friendship first.

31:29.809 --> 31:33.827
I know, even though we're both
desperate to get a boyfriend.

31:33.862 --> 31:37.867
Well, it'll just
happen when it happens.

31:40.251 --> 31:42.814
I know someone who
wants to go out with you.

31:42.849 --> 31:43.670
You do?

31:43.705 --> 31:45.762
Have you ever considered
dating my brother,

31:45.797 --> 31:49.281
who happens to be sitting
right here listening to us talk?

31:51.806 --> 31:55.389
- Hi, madison. It's me.
- It's jason.

31:56.674 --> 31:59.645
Uh, I told lauren it was
completely unnecessary for her

31:59.646 --> 32:02.616
to ask you when I'm perfectly
capable of asking you myself.

32:02.651 --> 32:04.006
Really?

32:04.041 --> 32:08.727
Really. By the way, I like the new you.

32:09.543 --> 32:13.803
Ha. Thanks. I would
love to go out with you.

32:15.651 --> 32:20.683
Ok, well, um, i'll
call you later? Ok. Bye.

32:26.508 --> 32:29.544
- Oh, my god!
- I can't believe it.

32:29.579 --> 32:32.206
Johnny depp.

32:32.241 --> 32:36.687
Ok. Alice, our next
guess is johnny depp.

32:36.722 --> 32:39.844
Oh, uh, he's married to
some french woman apparently.

32:39.879 --> 32:40.775
so?

32:40.810 --> 32:43.510
Well, obviously alice
doesn't go for married men.

32:43.545 --> 32:45.495
Can't she just fantasize
he's not married?

32:45.530 --> 32:47.921
Can't you... no.

32:48.974 --> 32:51.555
- Brad pitt.
- Brad pitt.

32:52.064 --> 32:56.873
- "ew. " uh, oh, raymond.
- Romano?

32:56.908 --> 33:00.866
No. The guy in science class.
The kid with the good hair.

33:02.348 --> 33:04.791
- She hung up.
- I don't get it.

33:04.826 --> 33:07.696
I don't get why she has sex all
by herself when she could have me.

33:07.731 --> 33:09.890
You get it. You do the same thing.

33:09.925 --> 33:11.716
So do you.

33:12.106 --> 33:13.354
I quit.

33:13.389 --> 33:16.367
You can't quit. Once you
start, you can never quit.

33:16.402 --> 33:18.107
You're just taking some time off.

33:18.142 --> 33:22.167
No, I quit. I'm in
love with amy juergens.

33:22.557 --> 33:25.580
I don't have anyone in particular.

33:26.076 --> 33:28.319
I know I can make you laugh.

33:28.354 --> 33:31.697
Amy was supposed to call me when
she got to her grandmother's.

33:31.732 --> 33:35.508
She'll call you.
I bet it's shia labeouf.

33:35.543 --> 33:37.275
Aw, please stop this.

33:37.310 --> 33:40.860
It's shocking to me that she
could put me off for this long.

33:40.895 --> 33:45.079
No, it's just shocking to you how she's
been putting you off for this long.

33:45.804 --> 33:49.554
You ever think about having sex with
amy? Of course you think about it.

33:49.589 --> 33:52.315
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- She's already pregnant.

33:52.350 --> 33:54.225
You and her could... And...

33:54.260 --> 33:57.552
We're gonna wait until we get
married. I love her that much.

33:57.587 --> 34:00.741
Oh, yeah? Well, I love alice that much.

34:00.776 --> 34:03.683
And if she'd let me, i'd
have sex with her tonight.

34:06.358 --> 34:09.600
I came over here just to
tell you that you're an idiot.

34:09.635 --> 34:13.188
Why is that? Because I didn't know
about your boyfriend or boyfriends?

34:13.223 --> 34:17.820
no. Because I'm thinking about you.

34:18.083 --> 34:19.788
I fantasize about you.

34:19.822 --> 34:22.757
I have this whole story I think
about where we're married and I'm in a

34:22.759 --> 34:25.694
wedding dress and we're in paris, i'm
on a balcony, and you rip the dress off.

34:26.108 --> 34:28.649
Enough, enough.

34:34.677 --> 34:37.495
I have to go now. I have
an algebra test tomorrow

34:37.530 --> 34:40.339
and my mother drove me over
here, and she's waiting for me.

34:40.373 --> 34:42.684
You were in the car with
your mom while we were

34:42.685 --> 34:44.995
talking about who you
fantasize about when you...?

34:45.030 --> 34:50.367
Yeah. She's my mother, and she's a
therapist. We talk about everything.

34:57.695 --> 34:59.119
That's not right.

34:59.154 --> 35:01.056
Well, look at the upside of things...

35:01.091 --> 35:06.365
She didn't tell her dad, although I
think her mother will tell her dad.

35:06.928 --> 35:11.453
Oh, why did I do this? What was I
thinking? Why didn't I take your advice?

35:11.488 --> 35:13.646
You want a ride home?

35:14.075 --> 35:16.147
No, thanks.

35:24.771 --> 35:26.597
Made me kinda sad.

35:26.632 --> 35:29.921
It's a sad story with a happy ending.

35:30.919 --> 35:32.023
Where's his father?

35:32.058 --> 35:34.756
He left when he was born.
He couldn't handle it.

35:34.791 --> 35:37.455
And so his mom was left
all by herself, and she

35:37.456 --> 35:39.944
didn't have insurance, so
my dad helped them anyway.

35:39.979 --> 35:42.108
That's why he left
the practice he was in.

35:42.143 --> 35:44.238
He's constantly doing
things he's not supposed

35:44.239 --> 35:46.668
to do as a doctor, like helping people,

35:47.489 --> 35:51.533
so when tom's mom had to go into
assisted-care living, he brought tom home,

35:51.568 --> 35:54.519
and then he and my mom
and me, we all adopted him.

35:54.554 --> 35:56.301
Why are you telling me this?

35:56.336 --> 35:59.219
Well, we thought maybe if
we told you more about us,

35:59.254 --> 36:02.103
then you'd tell us more
about you, and if we knew more

36:02.104 --> 36:04.573
about each other, maybe
we could really be friends.

36:04.608 --> 36:05.941
Yeah.

36:06.360 --> 36:10.013
Or maybe you'd decide that I'm
not the kind of guy you think I am.

36:10.048 --> 36:13.727
Maybe if you knew who my
mother was or who my father was,

36:13.728 --> 36:17.441
you'd be too scared to
even be in a room with me.

36:19.204 --> 36:23.225
I think I better go.
It was nice talking to you.

36:24.485 --> 36:26.557
Thanks.

36:40.536 --> 36:42.568
Hurry up.

36:55.747 --> 36:58.647
I can't believe you two would
sneak into my office at night.

36:58.682 --> 37:00.929
How'd you even get into the school?

37:00.964 --> 37:02.126
The gym.

37:02.161 --> 37:03.575
It's the construction.

37:03.610 --> 37:06.651
Anyone can get in, so it's
not like we were breaking in.

37:06.686 --> 37:08.439
How'd you get in?

37:08.474 --> 37:10.100
You're not supposed to
be here, either, sir.

37:10.135 --> 37:12.857
The gym. And I know the security guard,

37:12.892 --> 37:16.016
who called me when he saw
the two of you in here.

37:16.051 --> 37:17.949
Then why didn't you call the police?

37:17.984 --> 37:20.911
'cause I told the security
guard that this might happen.

37:20.946 --> 37:23.166
And I'll be the one to
ask the questions here.

37:23.201 --> 37:25.657
You know I could have the two of
you suspended from school for this?

37:25.923 --> 37:28.477
And you could be kicked
off of majorettes.

37:28.512 --> 37:31.311
And you could be kicked
off the football team.

37:31.346 --> 37:34.075
- Please don't do that.
- Yeah, that's scary.

37:34.110 --> 37:37.256
But it's probably not as scary
as getting fired from your job.

37:37.291 --> 37:39.726
I don't have your permanent record, ok?

37:39.761 --> 37:42.131
Permanent records are kept
in the principal's office.

37:42.166 --> 37:43.853
But you have access to it.

37:43.888 --> 37:46.762
I do, I have access.

37:47.086 --> 37:52.020
And I went to the principal's office
during school hours and pulled your file.

37:52.055 --> 37:54.397
I figured you had a point
about the entire school

37:54.398 --> 37:56.774
board knowing who your
father is when you don't.

37:56.809 --> 37:59.439
What do you get out
of this, if I may ask?

38:01.780 --> 38:04.509
Grace and I are friends now, kind of,

38:04.544 --> 38:07.914
and I told jack that i'd
get them back together.

38:07.949 --> 38:09.081
how?

38:09.312 --> 38:11.807
- I'll figure it out, ok?
- You better.

38:11.842 --> 38:13.402
I will.

38:15.847 --> 38:17.295
so?

38:23.192 --> 38:27.859
It's not a legally binding document.
It's just a copy of a copy of a copy.

38:31.416 --> 38:33.913
No, no, no. No touching.

38:35.472 --> 38:39.078
- Thank you.
- So when do I get grace?

38:39.113 --> 38:42.684
I said I'd talk to
her. I'll talk to her.

38:43.156 --> 38:45.586
Let's get outta here.

38:58.259 --> 39:00.712
- hi.
- How are you doing?

39:00.747 --> 39:02.690
Lousy.

39:03.423 --> 39:05.008
How about you?

39:05.043 --> 39:08.136
- The same.
- I'm sorry.

39:08.171 --> 39:11.940
I'm sorry, too, I mean, about mimsy.

39:12.411 --> 39:13.927
hi.

39:16.317 --> 39:21.181
I think I'm the one who should
apologize. I should've told you.

39:21.216 --> 39:26.016
It's kind of embarrassing having
alzheimer's when you can rember it.

39:27.247 --> 39:31.555
You know, I forgot to take my medication
when I left the house this morning,

39:31.590 --> 39:35.868
and I'm really much better
when I'm on my medication.

39:36.818 --> 39:41.594
You know, mimsy, I could still stay with
you. I mean, I could take care of you.

39:41.629 --> 39:45.970
Oh, amy, I know you could, honey,
but then who would take care of you?

39:46.005 --> 39:50.684
I'll take care of you. Both
of you. All three of you.

39:52.170 --> 39:57.059
You check back with us after you get
through this stage, and then we'll see.

39:59.881 --> 40:02.939
Mom, you can't just go home.

40:02.974 --> 40:05.997
No, I wasn't planning to.

40:06.270 --> 40:10.300
You see, when you called me and
told me that you were driving

40:10.301 --> 40:14.331
up, I ran out and pulled the
"sold" sign out of the front lawn.

40:14.366 --> 40:16.774
And then I went into a panic,

40:16.809 --> 40:20.523
because I was planning
on getting situated first,

40:20.558 --> 40:24.295
and then telling you that I'd moved.

40:24.561 --> 40:30.492
- to?
- To a very nice assisted-care complex.

40:33.748 --> 40:36.228
You know, I never liked that house.

40:36.263 --> 40:40.768
No. You know, your father
surprised me with it because he

40:40.769 --> 40:45.273
liked it, and I always wanted
a fireplace and a screen porch,

40:45.308 --> 40:48.903
and so now I've got a
fireplace and a screen porch.

40:48.938 --> 40:54.884
You know, it's odd that they'd provide
a fireplace for someone in assisted care.

40:54.919 --> 40:57.139
It's electric.

41:00.360 --> 41:04.107
You know, I'd been planning
on traveling for the next few

41:04.108 --> 41:07.854
months, a few of us there who
are still capable of traveling,

41:07.855 --> 41:11.602
and there's this very nice
doctor and his wife and... They

41:11.603 --> 41:15.349
said they would take us on
a trip through europe and...

41:16.595 --> 41:18.591
Well...

41:19.475 --> 41:23.352
I really would come and take care of
you though, amy, if you really need me.

41:23.387 --> 41:25.297
Mimsy, it's...

41:25.805 --> 41:29.282
- It's ok.
- Thank you. Thank you for that.

41:29.317 --> 41:34.085
I knew you'd say that. I
mean, I want to help, I do,

41:34.120 --> 41:38.854
but I'm really more of a
good-time girl, you know?

41:38.889 --> 41:41.355
I'm really not a good helping type.

41:41.390 --> 41:45.714
And besides, look at all the
people you have to take care of you.

41:46.815 --> 41:52.771
And I really would like to have this
vacation while I still can, you know?

41:53.472 --> 41:57.164
And you should take a
vacation while you still can.

41:57.199 --> 42:01.002
Take a little break
from george and go on out

42:01.003 --> 42:04.841
and do whatever it is
you've always wanted to do.

42:05.141 --> 42:07.689
Life is short, anne.

42:07.984 --> 42:12.435
Believe me, it's over
in the blink of an eye.

42:13.218 --> 42:17.652
- So you know about george and me?
- Yeah, I know.

42:18.362 --> 42:22.651
But don't worry. I'll soon forget.
