<i>Okay.</i>

01:21.849 --> 01:23.115
<i>Shit.</i>

01:25.753 --> 01:27.252
<i>Bridget,
can you get in here?</i>

01:27.254 --> 01:28.554
I need your help with something.

01:32.126 --> 01:34.176
<i>Hey, Bridge?</i>

01:34.177 --> 01:36.227
<i>I'll be in there
in one minute, okay?</i>

01:36.230 --> 01:37.350
<i>I'm trying to put him down.</i>

01:38.432 --> 01:39.765
<i>But, uh, bring a sweater</i>

01:39.767 --> 01:41.400
<i>if you're gonna be
out and about.</i>

01:41.402 --> 01:43.335
<i>And perhaps we'll start to...</i>

01:43.336 --> 01:45.269
I just need your help
for a goddamn second, all right?

01:45.272 --> 01:47.272
<i>So, uh,
speaking of getting out...</i>

01:47.274 --> 01:49.208
- <i>Bridget.
- Mom, seriously.</i>

01:49.210 --> 01:50.810
<i>God.</i>

01:50.811 --> 01:52.411
<i>Hey, Tommy,
what do you got happening</i>

01:52.413 --> 01:53.479
<i>for this weekend?</i>

01:53.480 --> 01:54.546
<i>Hey, how are you doing?</i>

01:54.547 --> 01:55.613
<i>We've actually got a lot
of great events</i>

01:55.616 --> 01:57.433
<i>coming up this weekend.</i>

01:57.434 --> 01:59.251
<i>If you go down to Philadelphia
on Thursday night...</i>

01:59.253 --> 02:00.486
Bridget?

02:16.437 --> 02:17.536
Hey, Bridge?

02:18.472 --> 02:19.538
Bridget!

02:21.074 --> 02:22.607
Bridge, can you come in here
for a second?

02:22.610 --> 02:24.510
I need your help.
I need your help with something.

02:24.512 --> 02:25.928
Which boots do you like?

02:25.929 --> 02:27.345
I think he's cutting
another tooth or something.

02:27.348 --> 02:28.447
Which boots? Hurry up.

02:28.449 --> 02:30.249
- Brett's going to be here.
- Black.

02:30.251 --> 02:31.450
I was thinking the brown.

02:31.452 --> 02:32.852
I don't like the brown.

02:32.853 --> 02:34.253
There are too many straps
going on or something.

02:34.255 --> 02:35.938
I like all the straps going on.

02:35.939 --> 02:37.979
I feel like it gives it
a little something extra.

02:38.692 --> 02:39.692
So...

02:40.461 --> 02:41.627
Where's he taking you?

02:44.231 --> 02:46.265
Some new place out in Media.

02:46.834 --> 02:48.834
Like Rustica or...

02:48.836 --> 02:51.436
The Rusticana,
or something rusticky.

02:51.438 --> 02:52.671
Ooh, it sounds fancy.

02:52.673 --> 02:54.439
Well, I'm a fancy girl.

02:54.441 --> 02:55.641
Don't expect to buy me
a hamburger

02:55.643 --> 02:56.742
and get a look at the goods.

02:56.744 --> 02:58.877
- Ugh! "The goods"?
- Right here.

03:05.286 --> 03:06.385
Okay.

03:07.688 --> 03:09.721
I'm fat.
You can keep the dress.

03:09.723 --> 03:11.623
All I ever wear anymore

03:11.624 --> 03:13.524
are baggy T-shirts
and sweatpants anyways.

03:13.527 --> 03:16.228
You're not fat, sweetie.
You're stuck in a rut.

03:17.598 --> 03:19.831
Do you know how much weight
I gained when I had you?

03:20.935 --> 03:23.535
- No.
- Forty-five pounds.

03:23.537 --> 03:24.803
That's a lie.

03:24.805 --> 03:26.789
I'm serious!

03:26.790 --> 03:28.774
I had this crazy,
crazy craving all the time.

03:29.543 --> 03:31.710
There was this place...

03:31.712 --> 03:35.347
out on 352 called Wagon Wheel.

03:35.349 --> 03:38.917
It's not there anymore,
but it was this big, like...

03:38.919 --> 03:41.720
like Sizzler-type place.

03:41.722 --> 03:44.456
And every night, my friend,
Karen G. Russo,

03:44.458 --> 03:45.991
used to pick me up.

03:45.993 --> 03:48.393
And we'd drive over
to Wagon Wheel

03:48.395 --> 03:50.896
so that I could get
the spicy meatballs,

03:50.898 --> 03:54.366
and I'd top it all off
with sour cream.

03:54.368 --> 03:56.501
It took me two goddamn years

03:56.503 --> 03:57.736
to get back
to my original weight.

03:57.738 --> 03:59.972
So, you can quit feeling sorry
for yourself.

04:00.541 --> 04:01.607
Okay?

04:01.976 --> 04:03.242
Mm.

04:04.278 --> 04:05.844
It's just I want things
to go back

04:05.846 --> 04:06.912
to the way they were before.

04:08.965 --> 04:11.015
They are not gonna go back
to the way they were.

04:11.018 --> 04:12.951
You make do with what's left.

04:15.188 --> 04:17.028
Oh, shit, that's him.

04:18.591 --> 04:20.358
Okay.

04:20.361 --> 04:21.927
All right. How do I look?

04:21.928 --> 04:24.263
- You look pretty.
- Just pretty?

04:24.265 --> 04:26.665
Not drop-dead, or stunning,
or beautiful?

04:26.667 --> 04:28.500
You look drop-dead

04:28.502 --> 04:33.338
and stunning
and beautiful as always.

04:33.340 --> 04:35.474
- Love you, sweetie.
- I love you, too.

04:41.849 --> 04:42.948
Don't wait up.

04:48.656 --> 04:49.855
- Look at you.
- Hi.

04:49.857 --> 04:51.323
You look handsome.

05:35.769 --> 05:37.602
What the hell
are you doing out there?

05:37.604 --> 05:38.970
Setting up the lights
on the catwalk.

05:38.972 --> 05:40.489
Come on out.

05:40.490 --> 05:42.007
Did you really pick
these out yourself?

05:42.009 --> 05:43.809
The girl
at the counter told me

05:43.811 --> 05:45.877
it's what all the hot mistresses
are wearing these days.

05:45.879 --> 05:47.879
Oh, that's really fucking funny.

05:47.881 --> 05:49.014
Come on out, babe.

05:49.016 --> 05:50.749
You're driving me crazy
out here.

05:50.751 --> 05:53.051
Well, put some music on,
for Christ's sake.

05:53.053 --> 05:55.721
There's nothing worse
than dancing in the quiet.

05:57.307 --> 05:58.890
Whoa, go back, go back.
I like that one.

05:58.892 --> 06:00.025
This one?

06:00.661 --> 06:01.727
Yeah.

07:02.623 --> 07:04.756
He was in my panty drawer again.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.024
How do you know?

07:06.026 --> 07:07.759
Because they're
all over my floor.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.728
What is it with him
and the panties, anyway?

07:09.730 --> 07:10.963
I don't know.

07:10.964 --> 07:12.976
Maybe he likes how they feel,
or something.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.166
It's weird.

07:14.168 --> 07:15.867
It's not weird, Mom.
He's a baby.

07:15.869 --> 07:17.068
He doesn't know
what he's doing.

07:17.070 --> 07:18.904
He knows something.

07:18.906 --> 07:22.007
Six drawers in that dresser,
he never goes after the socks.

07:22.743 --> 07:24.876
So, um...

07:24.878 --> 07:27.012
Tyler texted me...

07:27.014 --> 07:30.682
to see if I wanted to go
to dinner with him tonight.

07:30.684 --> 07:33.885
So... Oh, come on,
don't make that face.

07:33.887 --> 07:35.954
Can you watch J for me
for a couple of hours?

07:35.956 --> 07:37.088
If I have to.

07:40.861 --> 07:41.960
Don't let him
sweet-talk to you

07:41.962 --> 07:43.682
into starting something
up again.

07:44.765 --> 07:46.465
I'm just saying,
you get amnesia.

07:46.467 --> 07:47.999
He says one nice thing,
takes you out...

07:48.001 --> 07:49.634
Poof! You forget
all the shitty things

07:49.636 --> 07:50.969
he has done to you.

07:50.971 --> 07:52.637
Well, at least
he's making an effort.

07:53.640 --> 07:54.906
If he was making an effort,

07:54.908 --> 07:56.875
he'd come over to see his son
once in a while,

07:56.877 --> 07:59.644
instead of playing video games
and scratching his ass.

07:59.646 --> 08:02.013
Oh, Christ, don't say nothing
about Brett taking me out, okay?

08:02.015 --> 08:03.248
- I won't.
- I'm serious, Bridge.

08:03.250 --> 08:04.683
I don't wanna hear
her shit right now.

08:04.685 --> 08:06.585
- I won't. Jeez Louise.
- Yeah?

08:06.587 --> 08:07.953
I need some milk.

08:07.955 --> 08:09.187
The boys are about to get up.

08:11.058 --> 08:13.992
Aren't you lucky you live
so close to your little sister?

08:13.994 --> 08:16.194
I'm not sure
how you'd survive without me.

08:16.196 --> 08:18.196
Something tells me I'd manage.

08:18.198 --> 08:20.599
Will you send Terry over
to fix the garbage disposal?

08:20.601 --> 08:22.167
Every time I turn it on,
it makes this like...

08:24.605 --> 08:27.072
...sound, like there's a cat
stuck in there or something.

08:30.143 --> 08:33.211
So, how was your night out
with Brett?

08:35.115 --> 08:36.948
What? I didn't say anything.

08:36.950 --> 08:38.283
I saw his car pull up
in the driveway

08:38.284 --> 08:39.768
at four in the morning.

08:39.769 --> 08:41.251
- Oh, you.
- I thought that was all over.

08:41.253 --> 08:42.736
I don't know why
you're thinking about it at all.

08:42.736 --> 08:44.220
- The hell are you doing, Deb?
- Hey, you know what? Get out.

08:44.224 --> 08:45.991
Didn't we just have
this conversation?

08:45.992 --> 08:47.759
Get out. I don't want to deal
with your shit right now.

08:47.761 --> 08:49.027
You're gonna get yourself
in trouble

08:49.029 --> 08:51.013
running with a married man.

08:51.014 --> 08:52.998
Sooner or later,
you will get caught.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.201
<i>♪ It's where I find
Myself again ♪</i>

08:57.971 --> 09:02.941
<i>♪ Carry a laser down the road
That I must travel ♪</i>

09:02.943 --> 09:04.876
You know those aren't
the lyrics, right?

09:04.878 --> 09:08.613
<i>♪ Carry a laser down
the highway of the night ♪</i>

09:08.615 --> 09:10.949
<i>♪ Carry a laser down the road
That I must travel ♪</i>

09:10.951 --> 09:12.784
You're torturing those children.

09:13.887 --> 09:16.288
Aunt Kath,
I wasn't laughing at you.

09:16.290 --> 09:18.023
Grow the hell up, Deb!

09:24.131 --> 09:25.411
What'd she do this time?

09:26.266 --> 09:28.600
Go fix her garbage disposal.

09:28.602 --> 09:29.734
What's wrong
with it now?

09:29.736 --> 09:30.969
There's a cat stuck in it.

09:38.812 --> 09:39.878
Hey, Cindy?

09:41.181 --> 09:42.247
Cindy!

09:44.618 --> 09:45.684
Hey, Cindy?

09:45.686 --> 09:47.352
Cindy?

09:47.354 --> 09:48.653
What? I'm over here.

09:48.655 --> 09:50.655
Cindy, get over here.

09:50.657 --> 09:53.191
- Paul asked me to restock.
- Fuck Paul. Let's go.

09:59.132 --> 10:01.032
She'll shit herself
when she sees it.

10:11.912 --> 10:13.979
Oh, my god.

10:13.981 --> 10:16.081
Who got me this? Deb!

10:16.083 --> 10:17.882
Wait till football
season starts.

10:17.884 --> 10:18.950
You'll be pulling that thing out

10:18.952 --> 10:20.085
more than your wallet.

10:20.087 --> 10:21.987
- Oh, my god.
- I'm not wrong.

10:21.989 --> 10:23.855
Uh, sorry
to break this up, guys,

10:23.857 --> 10:25.690
but we've got quite
the line out there.

10:33.834 --> 10:34.966
You want the blueberry,
Mrs. Riley?

10:34.968 --> 10:36.768
You usually get
the home-style kind.

10:36.770 --> 10:37.836
This is blueberry.

10:39.706 --> 10:41.640
Let me go get
the home-style for you, okay?

10:46.313 --> 10:47.793
Pizza!

10:49.850 --> 10:51.683
- Hey!
- Hey.

10:51.685 --> 10:53.351
Hey, Patrick, put this
on the steps for me, will you?

10:53.353 --> 10:55.070
You're not the boss of me.

10:55.071 --> 10:56.788
I'm the boss of everyone.
Now put it on the steps.

10:56.790 --> 10:58.356
Can I please hold Jesse?

10:58.357 --> 10:59.923
- Need a hand with anything, Deb?
- No, beer's on the front steps.

10:59.926 --> 11:01.760
And can I show him
my new Viking battle sword?

11:01.762 --> 11:03.228
No Viking battle swords.

11:03.229 --> 11:04.695
Remember what happened
last time you did that?

11:04.696 --> 11:06.162
He had a bump on his head,
the size of an orange.

11:06.166 --> 11:07.232
No, Murph.

11:08.368 --> 11:09.768
Hey, hey, hey!
What are you doing?

11:09.770 --> 11:10.835
Put that down.

11:10.837 --> 11:12.157
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey, Deborah.

11:13.173 --> 11:14.706
- Thanks, Terr.
- Yeah.

11:18.712 --> 11:19.911
Do you want to say something?

11:19.913 --> 11:21.212
- Do you?
- No.

11:21.214 --> 11:22.530
Okay then.

11:22.531 --> 11:23.847
Looks like you got something
on your mind.

11:23.850 --> 11:24.850
Mm-hm.

11:25.085 --> 11:26.751
Where's Bridget?

11:26.753 --> 11:28.086
Date night with dipshit.

11:28.088 --> 11:29.354
I don't like that word, Deborah.

11:29.356 --> 11:31.022
Oh, I don't really give
a crap, Mom.

11:31.024 --> 11:32.957
Well, are they at least trying
to work things out

11:32.959 --> 11:34.192
- for Jesse's sake?
- God, I hope not.

11:34.194 --> 11:35.427
I think it would be a good idea

11:35.429 --> 11:36.928
if they tried
to patch things up.

11:36.930 --> 11:38.063
No one really cares
what you think.

11:38.065 --> 11:39.464
Haven't you learned that by now?

11:41.301 --> 11:43.068
Hey, cut it out.

11:43.070 --> 11:45.136
Cut it out.
Make yourself useful.

11:45.138 --> 11:47.272
Get the drinks ready
or something.

11:47.974 --> 11:49.374
Yes, sir.

11:49.376 --> 11:51.076
Idiot.

11:51.078 --> 11:53.011
Goofball.

11:54.381 --> 11:55.931
<i>One on.</i>

11:55.932 --> 11:57.482
<i>Right back in the third base!
In the second base!</i>

11:57.484 --> 11:58.950
<i>Double play!</i>

12:07.060 --> 12:09.928
Are you at least gonna apologize
for lying about Brett?

12:12.399 --> 12:13.732
Katherine Margaret Tate,

12:13.734 --> 12:16.201
I'm truly, deeply sorry
for my behavior.

12:16.203 --> 12:18.286
Yeah, you really sound like it.

12:18.287 --> 12:20.370
Just everything with you turns
into a goddamn lesson, you know.

12:20.373 --> 12:22.874
I get tired of hearing that shit
after a while.

12:22.876 --> 12:24.409
Do you think I want to do that?

12:24.411 --> 12:26.111
Do you think I want
to look out my window

12:26.113 --> 12:27.812
- to see if he's coming over?
- I don't know.

12:27.814 --> 12:30.915
You do it all the time,
so you must not hate it.

12:30.917 --> 12:32.150
Maybe you're bored
with your own life,

12:32.152 --> 12:33.284
you got to spy on mine.

12:33.286 --> 12:34.519
Okay, you know what?

12:35.922 --> 12:38.156
I do it
because I care about you.

12:38.158 --> 12:40.091
And God forbid, Mom finds out
you're going with a married man.

12:40.093 --> 12:42.227
Oh, God forbid.
Oh, God forbid. Amen.

12:42.229 --> 12:45.096
Holy Family might kick her out
of the Parish Bridge Club.

12:45.098 --> 12:49.000
Or, oh, Father Cassano might not
let me receive the Eucharist.

12:49.002 --> 12:50.535
You haven't gone to mass
in years, Deb.

12:50.537 --> 12:52.971
Because they look at me like
I'm some kind of leper there.

12:54.351 --> 12:55.728
Remember when I was pregnant
with Bridge,

12:55.729 --> 12:57.106
I used to walk in and see
all of Mom's friends

12:57.110 --> 12:58.076
pointing at me whispering...

12:58.979 --> 13:00.278
...like little asshole mice.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.147
Don't be so dramatic.

13:02.149 --> 13:04.282
Try looking at it
from the other side.

13:04.284 --> 13:06.518
He's got a wife
and three young children.

13:06.520 --> 13:08.953
They made a commitment
to each other.

13:08.955 --> 13:10.054
You're living in the Stone Ages,

13:10.056 --> 13:11.122
you know that?

13:11.124 --> 13:13.058
What's that supposed to mean?

13:13.059 --> 13:14.993
What it means is,
when you get to the altar,

13:14.995 --> 13:16.795
and you promise
to love and honor

13:16.797 --> 13:18.897
all the days of your life,
it doesn't mean what it used to.

13:18.899 --> 13:20.098
Okay? It's not practical.

13:20.100 --> 13:22.066
Well, worked for Terr and I,
didn't it?

13:22.068 --> 13:23.468
Well, you know why it worked?

13:23.470 --> 13:25.403
Because you never experienced
anything else.

13:25.405 --> 13:27.972
How do you know if what you got

13:27.974 --> 13:30.108
is the best thing
in the whole world?

13:30.577 --> 13:32.243
Terry.

13:32.245 --> 13:33.478
Terry's dick...

13:34.514 --> 13:36.948
is the only dick
you've ever seen.

13:39.186 --> 13:40.351
Oh, my god.

13:41.054 --> 13:42.253
Who else's?

13:44.024 --> 13:46.558
Oh, my god, Kevin Kramer.

13:46.560 --> 13:47.826
Kevin Kramer?

13:47.828 --> 13:48.993
Was it as big as they say?

13:48.995 --> 13:50.528
Carrie Manfry said
he had a hose.

13:50.530 --> 13:53.031
Do you always
have to be so crude?

13:53.033 --> 13:54.199
And what, you're proud
that you slept

13:54.201 --> 13:55.466
with half the men
in Delaware County?

13:55.468 --> 13:56.901
- Not proud, no.
- Kath?

13:56.903 --> 13:59.237
- I'll have my coffee now.
- Okay. Just a sec.

13:59.239 --> 14:01.472
But I know what's good
and what's not

14:01.474 --> 14:03.141
'cause I've been around
a few times.

14:03.143 --> 14:04.843
Oh, congratulations.

14:08.081 --> 14:10.014
Okay, what if someone else
came along?

14:10.016 --> 14:11.482
Someone else like Tom Selleck?

14:12.185 --> 14:13.885
Yes.

14:13.887 --> 14:17.355
Tom Selleck walks
into this kitchen right now,

14:17.357 --> 14:20.258
he says,
"Kathy, I gotta hard-on.

14:20.260 --> 14:23.061
Take you upstairs..."

14:23.063 --> 14:24.329
"Kath, I've got a hard-on."

14:25.999 --> 14:27.398
Wait.

14:27.400 --> 14:29.400
"Kath, I've got a hard-on.
Take you upstairs.

14:29.402 --> 14:32.637
Go down on you for an hour."
Would you say...

14:32.639 --> 14:33.938
Would you say,

14:33.940 --> 14:36.207
"Tom, I'd like
to fuck your brains out,

14:36.209 --> 14:39.444
but I made a promise to Terry
at the altar."

14:44.351 --> 14:45.650
Yes, I actually would.

14:45.652 --> 14:47.919
Bullshit.

14:47.921 --> 14:50.388
- Bullshit.
- Oh, god!

14:50.390 --> 14:53.057
Oh, god, you probably would.

14:53.059 --> 14:54.659
That's even more depressing.

15:33.533 --> 15:34.632
Bridge!

15:41.675 --> 15:43.041
Bridget!

15:50.317 --> 15:51.382
Bridget!

16:01.561 --> 16:03.628
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.

16:06.566 --> 16:09.233
Oh, come on. Okay.

16:11.037 --> 16:13.071
All right. Okay.

16:14.407 --> 16:16.341
Oh, goddamn it.

16:22.115 --> 16:23.715
<i>Hey, this is Bridget</i>

16:23.717 --> 16:26.050
<i>and Jesse. Leave us a message.</i>

16:26.052 --> 16:27.685
Bridget, it's 8:20.

16:27.687 --> 16:29.554
I don't give a shit
how hungover you are.

16:29.556 --> 16:30.722
You get your ass home.

16:30.724 --> 16:32.757
I'm not
your personal babysitter.

16:39.065 --> 16:40.131
No.

16:40.133 --> 16:41.232
Come on.

16:59.219 --> 17:00.485
Hi, Aunt Deb.

17:07.594 --> 17:09.426
- Hey, Kath?
- Down here.

17:09.429 --> 17:10.744
No, I already paid for that.

17:10.746 --> 17:12.061
What, with cash?

17:12.065 --> 17:13.664
Yeah, 700 dollars.

17:13.665 --> 17:15.566
I need you to watch him
for a little while.

17:15.568 --> 17:16.951
Bridget didn't come home
last night.

17:16.952 --> 17:18.791
- What's going on?
- I can't get ahold of her.

17:20.473 --> 17:21.673
Don't do anything stupid, Deb.

17:22.442 --> 17:23.641
I'll get my keys.

17:33.102 --> 17:35.262
All right. All right.
I'm coming. Jesus.

17:37.157 --> 17:38.423
- Can I help you?
- Where's Bridget?

17:38.425 --> 17:39.690
How would I know
where she is?

17:39.692 --> 17:41.426
She went out
with Ty last night

17:41.427 --> 17:43.161
and she never came home,
so I assume she slept here.

17:43.163 --> 17:44.395
- She never slept here.
- Where's Tyler?

17:44.397 --> 17:45.780
Out with some friends.

17:45.781 --> 17:47.164
Hey, you can't just barge
in here like that, Deb!

17:47.167 --> 17:48.389
Hey, Carol.

17:48.390 --> 17:49.612
You'd better get her
out of here.

17:49.613 --> 17:50.835
I'm going to call the cops
on her ass!

17:50.837 --> 17:52.537
Where's Bridget?

17:52.538 --> 17:54.238
You got 15 seconds to get out,
or I'm calling the cops, Deb!

17:54.240 --> 17:55.473
Tell me where she is,
and I'll leave.

17:55.475 --> 17:56.841
What did you do that for?

17:56.842 --> 17:58.208
I don't know
where the hell she is.

17:58.211 --> 17:59.444
I dropped her off
at Jenna's house.

17:59.446 --> 18:00.511
Dropped her off
at Jenna's house?

18:00.513 --> 18:01.546
- Jenna Cunningham.
- Why?

18:01.548 --> 18:02.680
All right,
we got into an argument

18:02.682 --> 18:03.748
- at dinner...
- Down to ten!

18:03.750 --> 18:05.383
Shut up, Mom!

18:05.385 --> 18:06.851
And she didn't want to go home.

18:06.853 --> 18:08.486
The girls were all hanging out
over there,

18:08.488 --> 18:09.620
so I dropped her off.

18:09.622 --> 18:12.123
Jeez, you crazy bitch.

18:12.125 --> 18:14.125
What did you call me?

18:14.127 --> 18:15.426
You're a piece of trash,
you know that?

18:15.428 --> 18:16.661
- Five seconds.
- You're fucking trash.

18:16.663 --> 18:17.951
All right, come on, Deb.
Let's go.

18:17.952 --> 18:19.240
- I'm trash?
- Yeah, you're trash.

18:19.241 --> 18:20.529
You're a dirty skank
who has phone sex

18:20.533 --> 18:21.599
with all her boyfriends.

18:21.601 --> 18:22.834
I'm trash.

18:24.370 --> 18:26.370
Yeah, Bridget told me
she could barely sleep

18:26.372 --> 18:29.173
because she'd hear her mom
fingering herself all night.

18:29.175 --> 18:31.375
Why don't you ever come by
and see your son, huh?

18:31.377 --> 18:32.788
Because you're a piece of trash.

18:32.789 --> 18:34.200
Because I know
you're going to be there!

18:34.201 --> 18:35.612
- His brain is about trashed.
- That's it. I'm calling.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.655
- Get the fuck out of here.
- Call them, Carol.

18:39.652 --> 18:40.629
Fucking call them!

18:40.630 --> 18:41.607
- Come on.
- Fuck you!

18:41.608 --> 18:42.585
- Deb, you can't just go busting
- Fuck you, Carol.

18:42.589 --> 18:43.821
into people's house like that,
you know that?

18:43.823 --> 18:44.823
Now, where are you going?

18:51.531 --> 18:53.164
She got here at around ten.

18:53.900 --> 18:55.199
I guess.

18:56.669 --> 18:58.736
She was upset.

18:58.738 --> 19:00.618
Said she had another fight
with Tyler.

19:03.309 --> 19:05.543
We had a few drinks.

19:05.545 --> 19:08.679
She left at around midnight,
I guess.

19:09.816 --> 19:11.883
So, she was just gonna
walk home?

19:13.353 --> 19:14.919
It's got to be over three miles.

19:14.921 --> 19:17.255
That's what I said.

19:17.257 --> 19:18.656
No, I said she should
just sleep here,

19:18.658 --> 19:20.458
and I'd drive her home
in the morning.

19:21.361 --> 19:22.693
But, um, she said you'd be mad

19:22.695 --> 19:24.775
if you woke up and had
to take care of Jesse, so...

19:25.465 --> 19:26.465
she left.

19:48.288 --> 19:49.587
What about Bridget's father?

19:49.589 --> 19:50.655
He's not around.

19:50.657 --> 19:52.256
How long has that been the case?

19:52.258 --> 19:54.892
Since he found out
I was pregnant 17 years ago,

19:54.894 --> 19:56.561
he never wanted anything
to do with her, so...

19:56.563 --> 19:58.203
Deb,
would you sit down, please?

19:59.299 --> 20:00.865
Where is he?

20:00.867 --> 20:03.568
- Where is he living now?
- South Carolina, Florida.

20:03.570 --> 20:05.836
Look, you're wasting your time
with him, okay?

20:05.838 --> 20:07.205
Tyler Hanrick,

20:07.207 --> 20:08.606
this is who you need
to be looking at.

20:08.608 --> 20:09.840
They got
into an argument last night.

20:09.842 --> 20:11.759
He admitted that.

20:11.760 --> 20:13.677
He never wanted her to have
Jesse in the first place.

20:13.680 --> 20:15.546
And he has been violent
with her before.

20:15.548 --> 20:17.348
What... What do you mean
he has been violent?

20:17.350 --> 20:18.649
I mean, he has hit her.

20:18.651 --> 20:19.884
More than once.

20:21.621 --> 20:23.487
And Bridget never liked
telling me all the shit he did.

20:23.489 --> 20:24.755
So, if it was more than once,

20:24.757 --> 20:26.390
you can bet it was
a lot more than that.

20:26.392 --> 20:27.725
Has an Incident Report
ever been filed?

20:27.727 --> 20:29.510
No,
I told her to file one,

20:29.511 --> 20:31.294
but she wasn't going to do that
to the father of her kid.

20:31.297 --> 20:33.464
What I'm saying is all the boxes
are checked off here. Okay?

20:33.466 --> 20:34.799
Deborah, would you
just please sit down?

20:34.801 --> 20:36.400
Mom, if you tell me
to fucking sit down

20:36.402 --> 20:38.269
one more fucking time,
I swear to God...

20:38.271 --> 20:40.138
Kath, can you just get her
out of here?

20:40.139 --> 20:42.006
Because I can't fucking
deal with it right now, Mom.

20:42.008 --> 20:45.509
We, uh, we understand
what you're trying to say,

20:45.511 --> 20:48.579
but Tyler claims he got in
from the date around 10:30 p.m.,

20:48.581 --> 20:50.548
and he stayed inside
the rest of the night.

20:50.550 --> 20:52.950
- His parents said the same.
- Oh, big fucking surprise.

20:52.952 --> 20:54.485
They'll say anything
to protect him.

20:54.486 --> 20:56.019
They will say any fucking
bullshit to protect him.

20:56.022 --> 20:58.623
They're fucking trash,
those people, okay?

20:58.625 --> 20:59.957
Right.

20:59.959 --> 21:02.426
Is there anyone else
you can think of,

21:02.428 --> 21:03.728
besides Tyler...

21:03.730 --> 21:05.596
...that would have
a reason to hurt her?

21:05.598 --> 21:07.565
There's no one else.
Right?

21:07.567 --> 21:09.567
Okay.

21:09.569 --> 21:12.703
Look, if you think
of anything else, let us know.

21:12.705 --> 21:14.005
In the meantime,

21:14.007 --> 21:15.806
we have her photo
in all of our patrol cars.

21:15.808 --> 21:17.608
Chester and Bucks County, too.

21:17.610 --> 21:19.530
If she is out there,
we're going to find her.

21:19.812 --> 21:21.712
What did you say?

21:21.714 --> 21:24.515
I said, if she is out there,
we are gonna find her.

21:26.586 --> 21:28.546
So, we're just supposed
to sit here and wait?

21:29.322 --> 21:30.988
Yeah?

21:30.990 --> 21:32.757
What are we
supposed to do? I mean, just...

21:32.759 --> 21:35.726
We will call you, Deb. Okay?

21:35.728 --> 21:37.295
- As soon as we get something.
- Okay.

21:37.297 --> 21:38.729
- I promise.
- Okay.

21:38.731 --> 21:40.631
You do that. Yeah.

21:40.633 --> 21:41.932
Thank you very much.

21:44.737 --> 21:47.872
Okay, um,
you all have a good night.

21:47.874 --> 21:49.373
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

21:49.709 --> 21:50.808
Okay.

22:10.463 --> 22:12.497
Okay.

22:12.498 --> 22:14.578
We're gonna split you all up
into four groups.

22:15.068 --> 22:17.368
Vans are waiting outside

22:17.370 --> 22:19.904
to transport you
to the search areas.

22:19.906 --> 22:23.374
And once you're there,
listen to your group leader.

22:23.376 --> 22:25.543
If you find something
that you think

22:25.545 --> 22:26.644
might be evidence,

22:26.646 --> 22:28.813
do not touch or move the item.

22:28.815 --> 22:31.349
Please,
notify your group leader,

22:32.018 --> 22:33.551
and we will process it.

22:34.587 --> 22:35.653
Okay?

22:37.724 --> 22:40.791
Miss Callahan, anything you want
to add, by chance?

22:41.661 --> 22:43.027
Deb.

22:43.763 --> 22:44.829
Go on up.

22:45.465 --> 22:46.597
Want me to...

23:00.546 --> 23:02.780
It's been, uh...

23:04.817 --> 23:07.551
It's been three days
since we last saw Bridget.

23:10.156 --> 23:12.390
She left home around seven.

23:13.760 --> 23:17.128
<i>She was wearing
a pink sweatshirt</i>

23:17.130 --> 23:19.163
<i>and white sneakers.</i>

23:21.167 --> 23:23.534
She had her hair colored
a few days ago,

23:23.536 --> 23:26.537
so it's a little lighter now,
little more blonde.

23:28.641 --> 23:29.774
But not much.

23:33.780 --> 23:36.147
<i>This is a mother's
worst nightmare.</i>

23:39.585 --> 23:41.619
<i>To know that your daughter's
out there somewhere,</i>

23:41.621 --> 23:44.655
<i>and that she's calling for you,
you can't get to her to help...</i>

23:44.657 --> 23:45.857
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

23:48.761 --> 23:50.895
I'm sorry.

23:56.436 --> 23:58.035
I miss my daughter.

24:01.007 --> 24:03.073
Her son misses his mom.

24:04.677 --> 24:06.644
We just want to find her
and bring her home.

24:07.947 --> 24:09.046
Okay?

24:37.210 --> 24:38.809
<i>Bridge loves animals.</i>

24:38.811 --> 24:41.045
<i>Especially horses.</i>

24:41.047 --> 24:43.647
<i>She used to volunteer
over at Willowmay Stables.</i>

24:45.551 --> 24:47.184
<i>And this is Clover.</i>

24:51.023 --> 24:53.057
<i>Bridget's grandfather
bought her for her</i>

24:53.059 --> 24:56.560
<i>on her 12th birthday.</i>

24:56.562 --> 24:58.095
<i>If Bridget's
out there watching right now,</i>

24:58.097 --> 24:59.857
<i>what would you like
to say to her?</i>

25:00.666 --> 25:01.999
<i>Just that I love her.</i>

25:03.236 --> 25:04.835
<i>That I'm always with her.</i>

25:08.207 --> 25:09.974
You have to eat something, Deb.

25:09.976 --> 25:11.041
You're scaring us.

25:14.747 --> 25:17.615
Now, I am going to stand here
until you eat that,

25:17.617 --> 25:18.983
and I am not going to let you up

25:18.985 --> 25:20.084
until it's done.

25:26.092 --> 25:27.892
Deb, where are you going?

25:27.894 --> 25:29.927
Cigarettes.
I'll be right back.

25:38.104 --> 25:39.970
Oh, Jesus, Deb.

25:39.972 --> 25:42.540
Just... I don't even know
what to say.

25:45.711 --> 25:47.545
I just can't even imagine.

25:48.948 --> 25:50.581
Deb.

25:50.583 --> 25:51.682
Deb.

25:53.553 --> 25:54.652
Stop.

25:57.823 --> 25:59.623
Deb.

25:59.625 --> 26:01.158
Will you come and stay with me?

26:05.932 --> 26:07.565
This week's really tough.

26:11.270 --> 26:12.736
The regional manager's in town...

26:12.738 --> 26:14.738
I... I can't...
I can't take another day

26:14.740 --> 26:16.240
of just sitting around
with my family.

26:16.242 --> 26:18.742
I just... Will you just
come stay with me,

26:18.744 --> 26:20.611
so I don't feel
so goddamn alone?

26:24.984 --> 26:26.083
Please.

26:28.321 --> 26:29.620
Okay.

26:29.956 --> 26:31.021
Okay.

26:32.024 --> 26:33.090
Saturday.

26:35.361 --> 26:37.161
I'll come stay with you
on Saturday.

26:47.940 --> 26:49.106
Okay.

26:49.108 --> 26:50.641
Try and get some sleep.

27:27.346 --> 27:28.912
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

27:28.914 --> 27:31.148
<i>Uh, just wondering
when you're going to be here.</i>

27:32.118 --> 27:34.418
Call me back, okay?

27:39.725 --> 27:42.159
<i>We get one night together
in the past month,</i>

27:42.161 --> 27:44.161
<i>and you decide to show up late?</i>

27:44.163 --> 27:46.063
Fuck you, Brett. Fuck you.

27:46.432 --> 27:47.698
Fuck you.

27:48.768 --> 27:49.833
Fuck you.

27:51.904 --> 27:55.105
<i>If you don't call me back
in 30 seconds,</i>

27:55.107 --> 27:57.875
<i>I'm going to drive over there
and tell your wife</i>

27:57.877 --> 28:00.711
<i>how you begged me
to let you come inside me</i>

28:00.713 --> 28:02.946
<i>because she wouldn't let you
do that anymore.</i>

28:03.416 --> 28:04.948
<i>Thirty seconds.</i>

28:18.464 --> 28:19.797
Fuck!

28:42.221 --> 28:43.787
Want some coffee?

28:43.789 --> 28:45.489
Deb, what the hell?
Jesus Christ.

28:47.059 --> 28:48.125
You need to leave.

29:01.207 --> 29:02.806
Get out of my house.

29:05.010 --> 29:06.930
What?
You think you're special?

29:08.080 --> 29:09.747
You think you're the first one
of his whores

29:09.749 --> 29:10.948
who has come to my house?

31:40.065 --> 31:42.466
J, it's 7:15.
Get moving. Come on!

31:42.468 --> 31:44.234
Where are my clothes?

31:44.236 --> 31:46.003
I left them on your dresser.

31:54.046 --> 31:55.946
- Morning, babe.
- Hey.

31:55.948 --> 31:57.668
How about some eggs
and sausage, huh?

32:06.292 --> 32:09.059
I'm playing poker
over at Timmy's later.

32:09.061 --> 32:11.161
Was going to call Terry to see
if he wanted to join.

32:11.163 --> 32:12.262
That's a good idea.

32:12.264 --> 32:14.264
So you won't be home for dinner?

32:14.266 --> 32:15.933
No, I want to have something
before I go.

32:15.935 --> 32:17.334
I don't want to eat
that fast food shit

32:17.336 --> 32:18.602
they got over there
all the time.

32:18.604 --> 32:21.338
Twists up my stomach.

32:21.340 --> 32:24.474
J and I are gonna go over
to Kath's house, I think.

32:24.476 --> 32:26.610
Make something up for me
before you leave, then.

32:28.547 --> 32:30.113
J, it's time to get moving!

32:30.115 --> 32:32.149
You're gonna miss the bus again.
Hurry up.

32:34.553 --> 32:36.520
Why does your grandmother
always got to scream at you

32:36.522 --> 32:37.587
to get you moving?

32:37.589 --> 32:39.456
Because I'm tired.

32:39.457 --> 32:41.324
You're tired because you're up
all night playing video games.

32:41.327 --> 32:42.860
Cut that shit out.

32:42.861 --> 32:44.394
Your ass will be running down
those stairs every morning.

32:44.396 --> 32:45.462
Want some cereal, hon?

32:45.464 --> 32:46.530
Mm-hm.

32:49.168 --> 32:50.567
Put that thing away.

32:50.569 --> 32:52.469
Why?

32:52.471 --> 32:55.372
Because I said so.
That's the only reason you need.

32:57.409 --> 33:00.077
Don't look at her.
I told you to put it away.

33:01.213 --> 33:02.279
All right.

33:02.581 --> 33:03.747
Hey!

33:03.749 --> 33:05.615
You're gonna learn
to listen to me.

33:05.617 --> 33:08.051
And until you do,
it's going to stay up here.

33:08.053 --> 33:09.119
Yeah?

33:22.167 --> 33:24.634
Why is he always
taking away my things?

33:26.038 --> 33:28.405
Ray likes to be in charge, okay?

33:28.407 --> 33:31.274
It makes him feel good
to be the boss of everything.

33:31.276 --> 33:32.509
It's annoying.

33:32.511 --> 33:34.077
Well, you don't have to be

33:34.079 --> 33:35.959
a shit all the time either,
you know?

33:36.248 --> 33:38.115
I'm not a shit.

33:38.117 --> 33:39.616
Not all the time.

33:42.421 --> 33:44.054
Look, Ray's a hemorrhoid.

33:44.056 --> 33:45.489
What's a hemorrhoid?

33:45.491 --> 33:49.192
A pain in your ass
that doesn't go away.

33:49.194 --> 33:51.661
But he's a hemorrhoid
who's paying for the house,

33:51.663 --> 33:52.729
and the groceries,

33:52.731 --> 33:54.581
and the bills
while I'm in school,

33:54.582 --> 33:56.432
so we have to put up
with some of his bad qualities.

33:56.435 --> 33:58.802
Do you have to keep dating him?

33:58.804 --> 34:01.038
Can't you find someone better?

34:01.040 --> 34:03.507
Well, that's the thing.
There is no one better.

34:03.509 --> 34:05.075
They're all the same.

34:05.076 --> 34:06.642
Sweet and charming
when they're chasing after you,

34:06.645 --> 34:08.178
then after they got you...

34:09.647 --> 34:11.847
...all that good stuff flies out
of the window.

34:12.251 --> 34:14.650
You're not gonna marry him,
are you?

34:14.652 --> 34:15.752
Ray?

34:16.288 --> 34:17.621
God, no.

34:17.623 --> 34:19.188
I'm not marrying anyone.

34:20.492 --> 34:22.492
Besides, Ray farts in his sleep.

34:26.781 --> 34:28.164
Fill out the Taxes column
by using a formula

34:28.167 --> 34:31.568
that calculates 35 percent
of the gross pay.

34:34.339 --> 34:36.273
What's the problem now, Deb?

34:36.275 --> 34:38.408
Nothing, um...

34:38.409 --> 34:40.210
Did you...
Did you say 35 percent?

34:40.212 --> 34:41.829
Mm-hm.

34:41.830 --> 34:43.447
And fill out the Net Pay
by using a formula

34:43.449 --> 34:46.248
that subtracts 35 percent
from the gross pay.

34:47.351 --> 34:49.853
Wait. Shit.

34:49.855 --> 34:52.489
Something just happened.
It all just went... Poof!

34:52.491 --> 34:54.458
"Poof"?

34:54.458 --> 34:56.426
Has anybody here ever seen
their computer go "poof" before?

34:58.079 --> 34:59.729
Can somebody please volunteer
to help Deb out,

34:59.731 --> 35:02.732
so she doesn't keep
on slowing us down?

35:02.734 --> 35:03.800
Thank you.

35:03.802 --> 35:04.868
Thank you.

35:09.675 --> 35:10.774
Is it serious?

35:10.776 --> 35:12.375
He's 16.

35:12.377 --> 35:14.611
I had Bridget when I was 16.

35:14.613 --> 35:16.346
Oh, I reminded him of that.

35:18.183 --> 35:20.550
Oh, shit, he's in love.

35:23.222 --> 35:24.938
Hope she's not with him

35:24.939 --> 35:26.655
just because he's the big
swinging dick football star.

35:26.658 --> 35:28.458
- Ew.
- Ew.

35:28.460 --> 35:30.193
And no, she's not like you.

35:30.562 --> 35:31.628
Ouch.

35:38.137 --> 35:39.870
So, how is Ray?

35:42.574 --> 35:44.708
Ray is Ray. You know.

35:47.846 --> 35:49.646
Heard you fighting
the other night.

35:50.883 --> 35:53.183
And?

35:53.185 --> 35:54.885
And I've been hearing that
a lot lately.

35:54.887 --> 35:56.887
So, buy a set of earplugs, Kath.

36:01.360 --> 36:02.559
Is it going anywhere?

36:02.561 --> 36:03.760
- It's been over a year.
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

36:03.762 --> 36:04.928
I'm sitting here
doing you a favor

36:04.930 --> 36:06.263
cutting out
stupid-ass footballs.

36:06.265 --> 36:07.431
You really gonna start in on me?

36:07.432 --> 36:08.598
- What's going on?
- Don't.

36:08.600 --> 36:09.933
You talk to her.

36:09.935 --> 36:11.434
All I did was mention Ray.

36:11.436 --> 36:12.802
Oh, Jesus Christ.

36:12.804 --> 36:14.538
Is that going anywhere, Deborah?

36:14.540 --> 36:16.373
Do you see
what you just started, Kath?

36:16.375 --> 36:18.542
Well, we all think that
he's pulling you away from us.

36:18.544 --> 36:19.877
"We all"?

36:19.878 --> 36:21.211
What, you all got together
behind my back?

36:21.213 --> 36:23.197
No, not behind your back.

36:23.198 --> 36:25.182
We were all together
at Murph's football game,

36:25.184 --> 36:26.616
and Ray's name came up,

36:26.618 --> 36:28.818
and we all came up
with the same idea about him.

36:29.555 --> 36:30.787
Which was what?

36:30.789 --> 36:32.422
He likes to control you,

36:32.424 --> 36:33.857
and that's pulling you
away from us.

36:33.859 --> 36:35.625
Do you know what's
pulling me away from you, Ma?

36:35.627 --> 36:36.927
- Ray.
- Not Ray.

36:36.929 --> 36:38.929
You assholes
fucking interrogating me

36:38.931 --> 36:40.831
all the goddamn time.

36:40.832 --> 36:42.732
Were you in on this little Ray
powwow thing, too?

36:42.734 --> 36:45.302
- Huh?
- "Huh? Huh?"

36:45.304 --> 36:46.870
- You fucking heard what I said.
- Just ignore her, Terry.

36:46.872 --> 36:48.838
All right, leave me alone, Deb.
I'm trying to watch the game.

36:48.840 --> 36:50.307
Did Ray come over here earlier

36:50.309 --> 36:51.541
to see if you wanted
to play poker?

36:51.543 --> 36:52.776
Yeah, yeah.
He called over earlier, yeah.

36:52.778 --> 36:54.544
Yeah,
so why didn't you go?

36:54.546 --> 36:55.879
Uh, I don't know. I'm tired?

36:55.881 --> 36:57.431
You know,
I've been working all week.

36:57.432 --> 36:58.982
Do you think you're better
than him? Is that it?

36:58.984 --> 37:00.850
What the hell are you even
talking about, Deb? Really?

37:00.852 --> 37:02.319
Is that what you're gonna
go with me?

37:02.321 --> 37:03.620
- We support you. That's all.
- Support me?

37:03.622 --> 37:04.955
When have you
ever fucking supported...

37:04.957 --> 37:06.823
Name one fucking time, Mom!

37:06.825 --> 37:08.658
You name one time
when I haven't.

37:08.659 --> 37:10.492
Do you want me to sit here
and start rattling them off?

37:10.495 --> 37:11.761
Because I'm very happy
to do that.

37:11.763 --> 37:13.697
Do you want me to do that? No.

37:13.699 --> 37:15.599
No. Because then everyone
would know

37:15.600 --> 37:17.500
what a fucking hypocrite
and a fucking fraud you are.

37:17.502 --> 37:18.969
What have I ever done
to you, Deb?

37:18.971 --> 37:20.604
- Oh, god!
- What is it that I've done

37:20.606 --> 37:21.905
that has made you
hate me so much?

37:21.907 --> 37:23.473
My whole life,
you've tried to silence me,

37:23.475 --> 37:24.908
- because I didn't fit in
- Silence you? Good lord.

37:24.910 --> 37:26.676
- to what you wanted me to be.
- I couldn't silence you

37:26.678 --> 37:28.411
- if I try, nobody could!
- And all you ever did

37:28.413 --> 37:30.280
was made me feel shitty
about feeling good.

37:30.282 --> 37:31.815
The only fucking person,
damn it!

37:31.817 --> 37:33.083
The only person, the only...

37:33.084 --> 37:34.350
Oh, here you go again
about your father.

37:34.353 --> 37:35.785
The only person who ever

37:35.787 --> 37:37.287
- understood you, right?
- Yes! Yes!

37:37.289 --> 37:38.922
The only person
who ever loved you!

37:38.924 --> 37:41.291
Yes! Oh, there you go,
tuning me out again.

37:41.293 --> 37:43.827
And you never answered
my fucking question.

37:43.829 --> 37:45.495
You want to know
why I didn't play poker?

37:45.497 --> 37:47.397
I just fucking
asked you that, didn't I? Yes!

37:47.399 --> 37:49.499
'Cause Tim Haggerty's
an asshole. Okay? All those guys

37:49.501 --> 37:51.051
- Ray hangs out with,
- Maybe you're the asshole!

37:51.052 --> 37:52.602
- they're all fucking assholes...
- Did you ever think about that?

37:52.604 --> 37:53.937
Maybe you're
the fucking asshole.

37:53.938 --> 37:55.271
- I'm the fucking asshole?
- Yeah!

37:55.272 --> 37:56.605
You know what, Kath?
Get her out of my house.

37:56.608 --> 37:58.041
Oh, you want me to get out
of your house?

37:58.043 --> 37:59.643
Yes! Please get the fuck
out of my house!

37:59.645 --> 38:01.278
You want me to leave?
Fine. Fuck you.

38:01.280 --> 38:02.045
- Okay, cool.
- Fuck you all.

38:03.315 --> 38:04.648
Jesse, let's go!

38:04.650 --> 38:06.483
Your aunt's kicking us
out of her house.

38:06.485 --> 38:07.884
But I wanted to play Nerf.

38:07.886 --> 38:08.952
Now!

39:07.913 --> 39:09.379
Wanna get
the other side, Mom?

39:09.381 --> 39:10.447
Uh-huh.

39:13.452 --> 39:14.551
Here.

39:16.855 --> 39:18.521
Are you going to put in 22?

39:19.725 --> 39:20.790
Yeah.

39:24.129 --> 39:25.562
So, where's Ray, Deb?

39:26.631 --> 39:28.098
At the refinery, Mom.

39:36.541 --> 39:37.974
Don't start. Not today.

39:37.976 --> 39:39.776
Okay? Not today.

39:39.778 --> 39:41.578
- Can I have cake now?
- Not now.

39:41.580 --> 39:42.946
- It's not ready.
- But I'm starving.

39:42.948 --> 39:44.881
It's not ready, okay?
Just sit down.

39:44.883 --> 39:47.617
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight...

39:50.989 --> 39:52.622
So I just want to thank everyone

39:52.624 --> 39:54.384
for making it out again
this year.

39:55.794 --> 39:58.595
Today, Bridget would've been
22 years old.

40:00.932 --> 40:02.515
More than anything,

40:02.516 --> 40:04.516
I just want her to know
that we still love her.

40:06.037 --> 40:08.671
that we haven't forgotten
about her,

40:08.673 --> 40:10.974
and that we're still
hunting down the answers.

40:13.111 --> 40:14.911
Happy Birthday, Bridge.

40:46.077 --> 40:49.078
<i>Second down,
17 yards to go in the quarter...</i>

40:51.917 --> 40:53.750
- Go!
- Come on!

41:01.193 --> 41:02.692
Attaboy, Murph!

41:05.464 --> 41:06.563
Attaboy, Murph!

41:12.804 --> 41:14.771
I'm going to go get a soda.
Do you guys want anything?

41:14.773 --> 41:16.840
- Can I have a hotdog?
- Sure.

41:16.842 --> 41:17.941
No?

41:39.898 --> 41:41.531
<i>Who were you talking to?</i>

41:42.701 --> 41:44.267
Huh?

41:44.269 --> 41:46.870
At the snack stand,
you were talking to some guy.

41:48.073 --> 41:50.073
Oh, Matt Carter.

41:50.075 --> 41:52.275
We went to high school together.

41:52.277 --> 41:53.710
Must be funny, huh?

41:55.146 --> 41:57.180
Class clown,
the way you were laughing.

41:57.182 --> 41:58.715
Whatever you're getting at,

41:58.717 --> 42:00.250
I wish you would just hurry up
and get at it

42:00.252 --> 42:02.185
instead of talking
all the time about it.

42:03.788 --> 42:04.921
Ah!

42:12.197 --> 42:13.963
Everybody told me about you,

42:13.965 --> 42:16.799
to stay away from you, Deb.

42:16.801 --> 42:19.869
You want me to keep paying
for your house and your car,

42:20.772 --> 42:22.805
and your fancy fucking haircuts,

42:22.807 --> 42:24.874
then your attitude's
gonna change.

42:24.876 --> 42:25.942
Do you understand?

43:12.591 --> 43:14.791
<i>Why do I even have
to see him?</i>

43:14.793 --> 43:16.626
<i>'Cause he's your dad.</i>

43:16.628 --> 43:18.712
<i>Not really.</i>

43:18.713 --> 43:20.797
I mean, he has never been around
or done anything

43:20.799 --> 43:22.599
like dads are supposed to do.

43:22.601 --> 43:24.033
I know.

43:24.035 --> 43:25.301
One day, you're gonna
come to me,

43:25.303 --> 43:27.003
and you're gonna wanna know
what he was like,

43:27.005 --> 43:28.638
and if he did skateboarding...

43:30.375 --> 43:31.908
...played basketball,

43:31.910 --> 43:33.209
and you're gonna have
all these questions

43:33.211 --> 43:34.944
about why you are who you are.

43:34.946 --> 43:37.046
So, think of it
as me covering my ass, okay?

43:38.216 --> 43:40.049
Hey, little man.

43:40.051 --> 43:41.784
Brought you some bottle rockets.

43:44.990 --> 43:46.255
It's been a while, huh?

43:47.826 --> 43:49.759
It's good to see you.
It's good to see you.

43:50.962 --> 43:52.762
You got so big.
Look at you.

44:12.784 --> 44:13.850
I quit.

44:17.355 --> 44:18.755
I wish I could.

44:27.999 --> 44:29.759
Thanks for bringing him
to see me.

44:31.369 --> 44:33.403
So you're living
down in Florida now?

44:36.007 --> 44:38.441
Yeah. Sober living house
for now.

44:38.443 --> 44:40.110
But if things go right,

44:40.111 --> 44:42.191
Kaylee and me are gonna get
our own apartment.

44:43.014 --> 44:45.081
She seems really sweet, Tyler.

44:46.251 --> 44:47.784
I'm happy for you.

44:51.823 --> 44:53.389
You really fucked me up.

44:54.759 --> 44:55.992
You know that?

44:58.329 --> 44:59.896
All that shit you made up

44:59.898 --> 45:02.131
about me being abusive
to Bridget.

45:05.203 --> 45:07.336
Everyone looked
at me different after that.

45:11.109 --> 45:13.309
No one ever laid
a finger on her.

45:17.949 --> 45:20.216
I swear, half the shit
I got going on right now

45:20.218 --> 45:21.718
is because of what happened
back then.

45:21.720 --> 45:23.152
I was in a really...

45:24.389 --> 45:25.922
bad place.

45:28.426 --> 45:30.493
Goddamn, I lost my daughter.

45:32.797 --> 45:34.397
I was looking for someone
to blame.

45:34.399 --> 45:36.032
You were just an easy target.

45:37.302 --> 45:38.501
I'm sorry.

45:47.212 --> 45:49.412
My mom came down to visit and...

45:50.482 --> 45:52.081
brought a bunch of old pictures.

45:52.083 --> 45:53.216
Oh, yeah?

46:07.832 --> 46:09.132
No, you keep it.

46:11.269 --> 46:13.202
And you can even cut me
out of it if you want.

46:13.204 --> 46:14.604
- I don't care.
- Thank you.

46:19.978 --> 46:21.844
- You don't still think...
- No.

46:23.047 --> 46:24.147
No.

46:25.550 --> 46:27.817
I stopped thinking that
a long time ago.

46:33.792 --> 46:35.792
I appreciate you raising him.

46:39.931 --> 46:41.431
Who knows?

46:41.432 --> 46:42.932
Maybe one day, I can put
all this shit behind me

46:42.934 --> 46:44.467
and be more a part of his life.

46:51.509 --> 46:52.842
Is he a good kid?

46:54.245 --> 46:56.245
I mean, he's not a troublemaker
or a smart-ass, is he?

46:56.247 --> 46:59.415
He's a really good kid.
Really good kid.

47:01.319 --> 47:03.039
- That's good.
- Yeah.

47:25.476 --> 47:27.543
Picked you up something
on the way over.

47:28.513 --> 47:30.279
Do you like Warheads?

47:30.281 --> 47:31.881
Got plenty of those in there,

47:31.883 --> 47:35.251
and some Nerds Ropes
and Lemonheads, too.

47:35.253 --> 47:37.854
My gran says
I'm not allowed to eat junk.

47:37.856 --> 47:40.590
You can have it this time,
sweetie, say "thank you."

47:40.592 --> 47:42.558
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

47:44.963 --> 47:47.163
Be good and listen
to what your gran says, okay?

47:47.599 --> 47:48.865
Okay.

47:50.235 --> 47:51.400
I love you.

47:52.337 --> 47:53.402
Okay.

47:54.339 --> 47:56.105
And keep in touch, Tyler.

47:57.208 --> 47:58.274
I will.

47:59.611 --> 48:01.143
See you soon, I hope.

50:00.765 --> 50:02.031
Hey, Deb!

50:03.301 --> 50:05.301
Oh, god, this is trouble.

50:08.773 --> 50:10.740
Let me transfer
my last two tables, okay?

50:28.659 --> 50:30.159
Don't eat that.

50:30.161 --> 50:31.260
What are you talking about?

50:31.262 --> 50:32.395
It's gonna get cold.

50:37.168 --> 50:38.968
What time did you get in
last night?

50:41.072 --> 50:42.371
Last night, I don't know.

50:42.373 --> 50:44.507
- Eleven?
- Eleven?

50:44.509 --> 50:47.109
Maybe later. I don't know.

50:47.111 --> 50:49.111
Some of the girls I used to work
with at Trucchi's came by.

50:49.113 --> 50:50.993
We sat around catching up
for a while.

50:51.716 --> 50:53.315
I stayed up until 1:30,

50:53.317 --> 50:54.784
waiting for your ass
to get home.

50:54.786 --> 50:56.752
Then I drive by Coco's
and see you outside

50:56.754 --> 50:58.687
talking to some black fella.

50:58.689 --> 51:00.089
You mean Paul?

51:00.091 --> 51:01.223
I don't know his fucking name.

51:01.225 --> 51:02.558
Paul's gay.

51:02.560 --> 51:04.260
Okay? A faggot.
That's what you'd call him.

51:04.262 --> 51:05.761
So, if you're worried
about me and Paul doing it,

51:05.763 --> 51:07.463
you can throw that idea out.

51:12.170 --> 51:14.703
Nobody's eating
until I say we're eating.

51:22.747 --> 51:24.680
Mm. Nice and fluffy.

51:24.682 --> 51:26.415
You know what the secret is?

51:26.417 --> 51:27.817
A fuckload of butter!

51:27.819 --> 51:29.118
Oh, yeah, you want to eat?

51:29.120 --> 51:30.853
Eat! Eat it all,
you fucking bitch.

51:30.855 --> 51:32.755
Yeah, eat it all!

51:39.163 --> 51:41.764
You want to eat.
There, fucking eat it all.

51:41.766 --> 51:44.200
Want to? Yeah. Fucking...

51:47.605 --> 51:49.872
Ray's hurting Gran!
Ray's hurting Gran!

51:51.509 --> 51:54.610
Goddamn it! Oh, shit!

51:54.612 --> 51:55.811
You fucking...

51:55.813 --> 51:58.314
Goddamn, Deb,
that hurt! Fuck!

51:59.851 --> 52:02.818
- Goddamn it!
- Get out of my house!

52:03.654 --> 52:05.421
Deb,

52:05.423 --> 52:07.756
put that goddamn thing down.

52:07.758 --> 52:09.225
It's over.

52:09.227 --> 52:10.459
I made a mistake.

52:11.395 --> 52:13.446
Are you all right, Deb?

52:13.447 --> 52:15.498
I will be when this son of
a bitch leaves my house.

52:15.500 --> 52:17.140
The cops are
on their way.

52:17.768 --> 52:19.735
If I walk out now,

52:19.737 --> 52:21.437
I'm never coming back.

52:22.173 --> 52:23.339
You sure you want that?

52:23.341 --> 52:26.342
Get out!

52:29.213 --> 52:30.880
Right. Yeah.

52:30.881 --> 52:33.241
Good luck finding somebody else
to put up with your shit.

52:33.918 --> 52:35.918
Fuck you, too, Terry.

52:41.893 --> 52:43.159
You all right?

52:48.533 --> 52:49.632
You bet.

53:15.960 --> 53:17.326
Hey, Terry,
you want a beer?

53:17.328 --> 53:19.208
Yeah, I'll take another one.
Thanks.

53:21.666 --> 53:23.599
I need a breather.

53:23.600 --> 53:25.533
Aunt Claire has got my ear
about her gallstones.

53:25.536 --> 53:26.869
Oh, god.

53:26.871 --> 53:28.404
- Deborah.
- Hi, Ma!

53:28.406 --> 53:29.471
Hi.

53:30.441 --> 53:31.674
Is that for me?

53:31.676 --> 53:33.475
Yeah,
I got you a present.

53:33.477 --> 53:35.978
- You didn't need to do that.
- Well...

53:35.980 --> 53:37.980
- Should I open it now?
- Yes.

53:41.319 --> 53:43.752
"To Deb.
All my love. Mom."

53:49.560 --> 53:52.428
That can go on the wall
of a new office.

53:54.765 --> 53:55.931
Yes, it can.

53:55.933 --> 53:57.967
Thank you. Thanks, Mom.

53:57.969 --> 53:59.235
You're welcome.

54:00.371 --> 54:01.770
Oh, I'll be right back.

54:01.772 --> 54:02.838
Okay.

54:03.941 --> 54:05.307
Outside!

54:06.344 --> 54:08.244
She's so proud of you.

54:08.246 --> 54:09.862
Actually get a job,

54:09.863 --> 54:11.479
maybe she'll have something
to be proud of.

54:11.482 --> 54:13.449
You should try calling
that Nancy Evans.

54:13.451 --> 54:14.617
She works over at Pennhurst,

54:14.618 --> 54:15.784
- that assisted living place.
- Oh, yeah?

54:15.786 --> 54:17.720
She has done real well
at that company.

54:17.722 --> 54:19.688
I'll take anything
at this point.

54:20.891 --> 54:22.925
Not just anything.

54:22.927 --> 54:24.693
You've worked too damn hard
for just anything.

54:24.695 --> 54:25.761
You deserve
something great, right?

54:25.763 --> 54:26.862
Right.

54:32.270 --> 54:34.303
Hey, you ready
to start dating again?

54:34.305 --> 54:35.571
No.

54:35.573 --> 54:37.506
Oh, hell, no. Why?

54:38.376 --> 54:40.042
I might know a someone.

54:40.044 --> 54:41.477
He works with Terry.

54:42.280 --> 54:43.345
He's cute.

54:43.881 --> 54:45.381
He's young.

54:45.383 --> 54:46.582
What do you mean young?

54:46.584 --> 54:47.783
Thirty-five.

54:47.785 --> 54:49.785
Kath, he's a baby.
Jesus Christ, no.

54:49.787 --> 54:50.986
Trust me,
it wasn't my idea.

54:50.988 --> 54:52.655
I know what a pain
in the ass you are.

54:52.657 --> 54:53.889
He pointed you out.

54:53.891 --> 54:55.975
What do you mean
he pointed me out?

54:55.976 --> 54:58.060
He was over for dinner last week
and saw a picture of you.

54:58.062 --> 54:59.628
What picture?

54:59.630 --> 55:01.096
Why's it matter what picture?

55:01.097 --> 55:02.563
'Cause if it's like a picture
from seven years ago

55:02.566 --> 55:03.999
when I was tan
and my ass was tight

55:04.001 --> 55:04.967
and my tits were standing up.

55:04.969 --> 55:07.002
What picture?

55:07.004 --> 55:09.972
Oh. A new picture.

55:09.974 --> 55:11.073
What's his name?

55:12.343 --> 55:13.409
Chris McGuire.

55:14.412 --> 55:16.245
Chris McGuire.

55:16.246 --> 55:18.566
We could all go out
together, if it makes it easier.

55:19.817 --> 55:20.883
Hey, Deb?

55:20.885 --> 55:22.168
Yeah?

55:22.169 --> 55:23.452
Uncle Jack
and Aunt Dottie are here.

55:23.454 --> 55:24.586
- Dottie.
- Hey!

55:24.588 --> 55:25.921
How are you?

55:35.700 --> 55:37.366
Oh, shit.

55:37.368 --> 55:41.036
Yeah, so, great. I turn around,

55:41.038 --> 55:45.374
I sit back down,
and the guy pours a cup of beer

55:45.376 --> 55:47.376
on top of my head.

55:47.378 --> 55:48.644
Yeah.

55:48.645 --> 55:49.911
Oh, come on.
Tell me you knocked him out.

55:49.914 --> 55:52.047
No, I wanted to.
Trust me.

55:52.049 --> 55:55.084
But I got my nephew sitting
right next to me.

55:55.086 --> 55:56.752
So, you know,

55:56.754 --> 55:58.854
I'm just stuck with it
the entire game, you know,

55:58.856 --> 56:02.458
drenched in beer,
freezing my ass off.

56:02.460 --> 56:04.126
But, you know, what can you do?

56:07.798 --> 56:10.566
So, uh, Deb, you like football?

56:11.135 --> 56:13.635
Oh, no, not really. No.

56:14.572 --> 56:16.572
Mm-hm.

56:16.574 --> 56:18.941
What do you, uh,
like to do for fun?

56:18.943 --> 56:20.709
Sleep.

56:20.711 --> 56:22.111
So busy with work and school.

56:22.113 --> 56:24.513
When I have time off,
I usually just sleep.

56:24.515 --> 56:27.516
Right. Yeah, I understand that.

56:27.518 --> 56:28.684
Um...

56:28.686 --> 56:31.720
Well, when you're not tired
and working,

56:31.722 --> 56:32.788
what do you like to do?

56:34.492 --> 56:37.059
I can't remember the last time
I wasn't tired and working.

56:39.463 --> 56:41.063
You know what?

56:41.065 --> 56:44.099
I'm going to go to the bathroom.
Deb, do you want to come?

56:44.101 --> 56:45.701
I'm good, thanks.

57:00.618 --> 57:02.684
- Night.
- Night.

57:02.686 --> 57:04.086
Send J over.

57:08.993 --> 57:10.993
Jesse? Come on.

57:18.969 --> 57:21.170
- <i>Hello.</i>
- What was that?

57:21.172 --> 57:22.438
<i>What?</i>

57:22.440 --> 57:23.739
You didn't say a word all night.

57:23.741 --> 57:25.607
You just sat there
like a little statue.

57:25.609 --> 57:27.743
<i>Yeah, because I obviously
didn't want to be there.</i>

57:27.745 --> 57:29.161
Then why did you go?

57:29.162 --> 57:30.578
- <i>Because you made me.</i>
- Night, Aunt Kath.

57:30.581 --> 57:32.080
Night, hon.

57:32.082 --> 57:33.582
I didn't make you
do anything, Deb.

57:33.584 --> 57:35.301
<i>I'm tired.
I'm going to bed.</i>

57:35.302 --> 57:37.019
Oh, I know you're tired.
Everyone knows you're tired.

57:37.021 --> 57:38.687
You made that very clear.

57:38.689 --> 57:40.306
<i>He made an effort.</i>

57:40.307 --> 57:41.924
- <i>He brought you flowers.</i>
- Oh, oh, he bought me flowers.

57:41.926 --> 57:43.893
So I guess since he spent 7.50,

57:43.894 --> 57:45.861
I should just spread my legs,
let him do me under the booth?

57:45.863 --> 57:47.103
You've done it before for less.

57:49.133 --> 57:52.501
Flowers. I hate fucking
flowers anyway.

57:52.503 --> 57:55.604
All they do is sit on a table
and die and smell like shit.

57:55.606 --> 57:57.206
Go to bed. Wait, give me that.

57:58.175 --> 57:59.541
Go to bed.

58:06.917 --> 58:08.617
It's not a match, okay?

58:08.619 --> 58:10.052
What was wrong with him?

58:10.054 --> 58:11.253
<i>A lot of things.</i>

58:11.255 --> 58:13.055
Like?

58:13.057 --> 58:14.756
Like, I didn't find
him attractive.

58:14.758 --> 58:16.191
Like, if he really wanted
to make an effort

58:16.193 --> 58:17.993
he wouldn't have come
in his goddamn work clothes.

58:17.995 --> 58:19.761
Maybe he would've washed
his fucking hands.

58:19.763 --> 58:21.523
Fine. He thought
you were too old anyway.

58:36.146 --> 58:38.213
Brian, can you give me
two of those beers?

58:38.716 --> 58:39.815
Yeah.

58:46.090 --> 58:49.658
- Hm.
- Get you started with a drink?

58:49.660 --> 58:53.862
Yeah. Could I get
a Bud draft, please...

58:53.864 --> 58:56.765
Oh, whoa, Deb.
I didn't know you worked here.

58:56.767 --> 58:58.567
Cut the crap.

58:58.569 --> 59:00.068
I just saw you.
You turned to my station.

59:00.070 --> 59:01.236
What do you want?

59:01.238 --> 59:03.972
I'm gonna do the,
uh, cheesesteak

59:03.974 --> 59:07.209
- and fried onions.
- No. I mean, what do you want?

59:07.211 --> 59:10.746
I'm 38 years old,
raising a seven-year-old boy.

59:10.748 --> 59:13.015
If you're looking for a fling
or a party girl

59:13.017 --> 59:14.683
or someone you can have
some fun with,

59:14.685 --> 59:15.951
just keep on looking.

59:15.953 --> 59:18.053
Well, I just so happen
to be in the market

59:18.055 --> 59:20.756
for a 38-year-old waitress

59:20.758 --> 59:22.624
that has
a seven-year-old grandson

59:22.626 --> 59:25.193
that just doesn't like
to have any fun at all, so...

59:25.195 --> 59:26.795
it's kind of perfect.

59:29.867 --> 59:31.600
Bud draft with a cheesesteak,
fried onions?

59:31.602 --> 59:33.302
Mm-hm.

59:33.304 --> 59:35.637
- Ketchup?
- Hell yes.

59:37.141 --> 59:39.141
Pick me up at seven on Saturday.

59:47.785 --> 59:49.084
You wanna come in?

59:49.820 --> 59:50.886
Yeah.

59:57.227 --> 59:58.961
That's Terry's house.

59:58.963 --> 01:00:00.243
Yeah.

01:00:02.166 --> 01:00:03.799
Come on in.

01:00:15.212 --> 01:00:17.312
Hey, we just got back.
Will you send J over?

01:00:17.314 --> 01:00:19.314
<i>Well, how was it?</i>

01:00:19.316 --> 01:00:21.083
It was good.

01:00:21.085 --> 01:00:23.752
<i>Did he clean up?
How was his outfit?</i>

01:00:24.822 --> 01:00:26.054
Can we talk about this later?

01:00:26.056 --> 01:00:27.389
Because he's standing right
in front of me

01:00:27.391 --> 01:00:28.824
and I want to wait
until he leaves

01:00:28.826 --> 01:00:30.392
to tell you what
a shitty date he was.

01:00:30.394 --> 01:00:31.727
<i>Okay.</i>

01:00:31.729 --> 01:00:33.245
Okay.

01:00:33.246 --> 01:00:34.762
<i>Call me
as soon as he's gone.</i>

01:00:34.765 --> 01:00:36.965
I'm going
to use the bathroom.

01:00:36.967 --> 01:00:39.301
Don't get too comfortable.
You're not staying long.

01:00:39.303 --> 01:00:40.802
Oh, that's fine.
I got another date

01:00:40.804 --> 01:00:42.004
I got to get to anyway, so...

01:00:42.006 --> 01:00:43.138
Ha-ha.

01:00:55.185 --> 01:00:56.318
Hey.

01:00:57.121 --> 01:00:58.121
I'm Chris.

01:01:01.992 --> 01:01:03.291
J, this is Chris.

01:01:03.293 --> 01:01:04.993
Yeah, we just met.

01:01:04.995 --> 01:01:07.262
Go take a shower, 30 minutes
of TV in my room, okay?

01:01:07.264 --> 01:01:09.431
- But I wanted to...
- But nothing. Go, 30 minutes.

01:01:09.433 --> 01:01:10.799
You want a beer?

01:01:11.935 --> 01:01:13.235
Sure, why not.

01:01:18.008 --> 01:01:19.307
Thank you.

01:01:23.313 --> 01:01:25.347
So Kath made you dress up?

01:01:26.850 --> 01:01:28.984
She, uh, she might've hinted

01:01:28.986 --> 01:01:31.420
that improving
my wardrobe could...

01:01:31.422 --> 01:01:33.722
produce better results, yes.

01:01:33.724 --> 01:01:34.990
Oh, really?

01:01:35.959 --> 01:01:37.959
I liked you better before.

01:01:37.961 --> 01:01:39.161
Really?

01:01:43.801 --> 01:01:45.767
Hey, so, uh...

01:01:45.769 --> 01:01:47.929
Terry told me about what
happened with your daughter.

01:01:48.806 --> 01:01:51.073
Deb, I'm real sorry.

01:01:51.075 --> 01:01:52.174
Whoo.

01:01:59.149 --> 01:02:01.249
I don't really smoke anymore.
I just...

01:02:02.886 --> 01:02:04.853
Every now and then,
I get the urge.

01:02:07.891 --> 01:02:09.825
Kath told me
you're a great mother.

01:02:13.130 --> 01:02:14.796
I wish that were true.

01:02:20.270 --> 01:02:22.971
I was 16 years old
when I had Bridget.

01:02:25.476 --> 01:02:28.210
Slept with some guy two times,
that was it.

01:02:28.979 --> 01:02:30.278
First boyfriend?

01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:32.981
- First everything.
- Hm.

01:02:34.485 --> 01:02:35.851
And he wanted me
to have an abortion,

01:02:35.853 --> 01:02:37.252
but I wanted her too bad.

01:02:39.123 --> 01:02:41.957
I was so nervous,
I slept on her floor every night

01:02:41.959 --> 01:02:43.191
for the first year.

01:02:44.128 --> 01:02:45.994
I didn't know what I was doing.

01:02:48.065 --> 01:02:49.931
I don't know
how you made it through it.

01:02:53.003 --> 01:02:54.336
I almost didn't.

01:02:59.009 --> 01:03:01.476
Well, you made it back.

01:03:03.547 --> 01:03:06.014
Back to what?

01:03:07.050 --> 01:03:09.117
That's the question.

01:03:19.963 --> 01:03:21.196
What's it telling you?

01:03:26.537 --> 01:03:28.170
I wish I knew.

01:03:31.875 --> 01:03:34.376
Why can't I go to Music Beats
after school?

01:03:34.378 --> 01:03:36.044
Who are the teachers?

01:03:36.046 --> 01:03:38.280
- I don't know.
- Exactly.

01:03:38.282 --> 01:03:39.581
I don't want you
spending time alone

01:03:39.583 --> 01:03:41.416
with people I don't know.

01:03:41.418 --> 01:03:44.119
Timmy's allowed to go.
So is Brian.

01:03:44.121 --> 01:03:45.987
I'm not in charge
of Timmy and Brian.

01:03:45.989 --> 01:03:47.355
I'm in charge of you.

01:03:47.357 --> 01:03:49.324
You never let me go anywhere.

01:03:50.427 --> 01:03:53.028
I feel like you're
suffocating me.

01:03:53.030 --> 01:03:55.163
You don't even know
what "suffocating" means.

01:03:55.165 --> 01:03:56.932
Like, you can't breathe.

01:03:58.902 --> 01:04:01.102
You seem to be breathing
just fine to me.

01:04:01.104 --> 01:04:02.304
Get in the car.

01:04:06.076 --> 01:04:08.109
Steelworkers' Sons.

01:04:08.111 --> 01:04:09.544
That's what we called ourselves.

01:04:09.546 --> 01:04:10.612
Were you any good?

01:04:10.614 --> 01:04:11.913
No, no, no.

01:04:11.915 --> 01:04:13.415
We were awful.

01:04:15.468 --> 01:04:17.518
But we, we did
the whole Jersey Shore tour

01:04:17.521 --> 01:04:19.221
for like a few years.

01:04:19.223 --> 01:04:21.890
Point Pleasant,
all the way down to Wildwood.

01:04:21.892 --> 01:04:23.191
It was beautiful.

01:04:25.996 --> 01:04:28.230
All the college girls
throwing themselves at you?

01:04:28.232 --> 01:04:29.631
Oh, you would not believe it.

01:04:29.633 --> 01:04:33.168
I would walk off that stage
every single night

01:04:33.170 --> 01:04:35.036
with a trash bag
full of panties.

01:04:35.038 --> 01:04:36.938
- Ew.
- Yeah, that was gross.

01:04:36.940 --> 01:04:38.607
That was actually
not true at all.

01:04:40.310 --> 01:04:41.943
You know, I had this, uh...

01:04:43.046 --> 01:04:46.581
I had this routine where...

01:04:46.583 --> 01:04:48.083
I would pick out
the prettiest girl

01:04:48.085 --> 01:04:49.150
in the audience

01:04:49.152 --> 01:04:53.088
real early on
in the show, and...

01:04:53.090 --> 01:04:55.657
when the last song
came around, I would...

01:04:55.659 --> 01:04:58.927
ask her to join me on the stage
to dance with me.

01:05:00.364 --> 01:05:02.297
You know, I would've picked
you out right away.

01:05:02.299 --> 01:05:04.065
- Oh, really?
- Mm-hm.

01:05:04.067 --> 01:05:05.467
- Hm.
- My god.

01:05:05.469 --> 01:05:07.302
Um, actually,

01:05:09.439 --> 01:05:11.339
you're going to want this.
Trust me.

01:05:12.509 --> 01:05:14.487
I'm not.

01:05:14.488 --> 01:05:16.466
No, you're gonna,
you're gonna love this.

01:05:16.467 --> 01:05:18.445
Hey, everybody, thank you.
Please, please calm down.

01:05:18.448 --> 01:05:22.050
Would the beautiful girl
in the blue jeans

01:05:22.052 --> 01:05:25.387
and the gorgeous pink top...

01:05:25.389 --> 01:05:28.156
come up here
on the stage with me?

01:05:28.158 --> 01:05:30.659
No, thanks.

01:05:30.661 --> 01:05:32.627
Well, I'm not going
to sing us out of here

01:05:32.629 --> 01:05:34.162
until you're up here
with me, so...

01:05:34.164 --> 01:05:36.264
I'm just gonna stay here
with my friends.

01:05:36.266 --> 01:05:38.099
Oh, you're going to stay
down there with your friends?

01:05:38.101 --> 01:05:39.067
Yeah. Mm-hm.

01:05:39.069 --> 01:05:40.549
- You sure?
- Mm-hm.

01:05:41.705 --> 01:05:42.971
Really?

01:05:48.946 --> 01:05:50.078
Oh, Deb.

01:05:51.515 --> 01:05:52.614
Deb.

01:05:55.519 --> 01:05:57.118
Come on, try me out.

01:05:58.989 --> 01:06:02.190
I'm not that good of a dancer
but try me out. Come on.

01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:04.993
Come on. Come on.

01:06:07.664 --> 01:06:09.397
I don't dance.

01:06:09.399 --> 01:06:11.566
I'm a terrible dancer,
too, so...

01:06:18.575 --> 01:06:20.275
I just made all that shit up,

01:06:20.277 --> 01:06:21.576
so you'd dance
with you, you know?

01:06:21.578 --> 01:06:23.178
I figured as much.

01:06:24.715 --> 01:06:27.315
Steelworkers' Sons.

01:06:27.317 --> 01:06:29.117
I don't know.

01:06:40.697 --> 01:06:42.097
Hey, Deb?

01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:44.299
Yeah?

01:06:45.302 --> 01:06:46.534
Is everything okay?

01:06:55.712 --> 01:06:57.078
I can't.

01:07:03.220 --> 01:07:04.620
Okay.

01:07:12.429 --> 01:07:13.595
Come here.

01:07:15.399 --> 01:07:17.098
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:07:17.100 --> 01:07:19.100
- Come here.
- Okay.

01:07:27.377 --> 01:07:28.443
Hey.

01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:31.780
I'm not going to hurt you, Deb.

01:09:17.420 --> 01:09:19.587
You want to say
some words, sweetie?

01:09:21.424 --> 01:09:23.625
Bye, Clover.

01:09:23.627 --> 01:09:26.294
I'm going to miss
making you obstacle courses.

01:09:27.363 --> 01:09:29.296
I hope you were happy here.

01:09:30.533 --> 01:09:32.700
Say hi to my mom if you see her.

01:09:34.837 --> 01:09:35.904
Amen.

01:09:38.341 --> 01:09:39.407
Amen.

01:10:16.947 --> 01:10:18.797
Is everyone here?

01:10:18.798 --> 01:10:20.648
- Everyone but Cindy.
- Where the fuck is Cindy?

01:10:20.650 --> 01:10:22.383
- We're starting in 15 minutes.
- She went to the Wawa

01:10:22.385 --> 01:10:24.319
to get coffee creamer.
Relax, breathe.

01:10:24.321 --> 01:10:26.287
Hello. Hello!
Where's the gorgeous bride?

01:10:26.289 --> 01:10:27.522
Mom, I told you
to stay down

01:10:27.524 --> 01:10:28.957
'til we're ready to come out.

01:10:28.958 --> 01:10:30.391
Well, I wanted
to give you a present.

01:10:30.393 --> 01:10:33.461
I wore this the day
your father and I got married.

01:10:33.463 --> 01:10:34.896
Does that mean
I have to wear it?

01:10:34.898 --> 01:10:37.699
Yes. It's an heirloom.

01:10:37.701 --> 01:10:39.534
Oh, you shouldn't be drinking.

01:10:41.605 --> 01:10:43.771
So, I suppose you're gonna go
through with this.

01:10:43.773 --> 01:10:45.190
Oh, my fucking god.

01:10:45.191 --> 01:10:46.608
Mom, are you
really doing this right now?

01:10:46.610 --> 01:10:47.809
I am just asking questions

01:10:47.811 --> 01:10:49.477
that any mother would ask.

01:10:49.479 --> 01:10:51.312
You've been dating him for what?
Eight weeks?

01:10:51.314 --> 01:10:52.614
I mean, I don't even know
his last name.

01:10:52.616 --> 01:10:53.698
McGuire!

01:10:53.699 --> 01:10:54.781
Well, see,
I didn't know that.

01:10:54.784 --> 01:10:56.150
It's on the invitation.

01:10:56.151 --> 01:10:57.517
Kath, could you get me
a cigarette, please?

01:10:57.518 --> 01:10:58.884
Don't smoke.
Your dress is going to smell.

01:10:58.888 --> 01:11:00.021
Oh, my god.

01:11:03.393 --> 01:11:04.759
I am not trying
to make you anxious.

01:11:04.761 --> 01:11:06.294
But eight weeks
is just not enough time

01:11:06.296 --> 01:11:08.079
to get to know somebody...

01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:09.863
So you thought you would come
in here and talk me out of it?

01:11:09.866 --> 01:11:11.399
Well, I thought
I'd give it a try.

01:11:11.401 --> 01:11:12.767
Have I ever listened
to you, Mom?

01:11:12.769 --> 01:11:14.052
- No.
- Right.

01:11:14.053 --> 01:11:15.336
So, I'm going
to smoke that cigarette.

01:11:15.338 --> 01:11:17.505
Uh-huh.

01:11:17.507 --> 01:11:18.973
I'm going to go
downstairs and marry the man

01:11:18.975 --> 01:11:21.776
that I've been dating
and screwing...

01:11:23.546 --> 01:11:26.414
...for the past fucking
eight weeks,

01:11:26.416 --> 01:11:27.849
and I'm going to give everyone
a big bear hug.

01:11:27.851 --> 01:11:28.950
Oh, shit.

01:11:28.952 --> 01:11:30.918
Oh, my dress,
it smells like smoke.

01:11:33.290 --> 01:11:34.355
Oh, god.

01:11:34.357 --> 01:11:36.024
Mom, just...

01:11:36.026 --> 01:11:39.560
- Here.
- Right.

01:11:39.562 --> 01:11:41.296
- All right.
- Go now.

01:11:41.298 --> 01:11:43.364
- Goddamn it.
- At least he's Catholic.

01:11:43.366 --> 01:11:44.932
Mom, you going to go
in the other car?

01:11:44.934 --> 01:11:46.684
- Be careful.
- Oh, god.

01:11:46.685 --> 01:11:48.435
All right, we're going
in the van. Let's go.

01:11:48.438 --> 01:11:50.278
You're gonna trip.
Be careful.

01:11:52.609 --> 01:11:53.675
You got lipstick?

01:11:53.677 --> 01:11:54.776
I got it!

01:11:54.778 --> 01:11:55.910
All right. She has got it.

01:12:13.496 --> 01:12:15.763
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I introduce to you,

01:12:15.765 --> 01:12:18.499
Mr. and Mrs. Chris McGuire!

01:12:41.925 --> 01:12:44.492
Okay. Uh...

01:12:44.494 --> 01:12:46.694
Excuse me, everybody.
I'd like to say a few words.

01:12:46.696 --> 01:12:49.597
Oh, god. Oh, god.

01:12:49.599 --> 01:12:51.466
I promise it won't hurt
that bad, Deb.

01:12:51.468 --> 01:12:54.402
Uh, if any of you don't know
who I am,

01:12:54.404 --> 01:12:56.804
then you should probably leave
because you're on my property.

01:12:57.923 --> 01:12:59.039
I'm just kidding around.
I'm playing around.

01:12:59.042 --> 01:13:01.076
My name is Terry, and, uh,

01:13:01.077 --> 01:13:03.111
I'm very proud to be
Deb's favorite brother-in-law.

01:13:03.113 --> 01:13:04.545
- Only brother-in-law.
- Only brother-in-law.

01:13:04.547 --> 01:13:05.780
- Yeah.
- Whatever. I win by default.

01:13:05.782 --> 01:13:09.417
- No choice.
- And she's just as beautiful

01:13:09.419 --> 01:13:10.852
and as much of a pain in the ass

01:13:10.854 --> 01:13:12.720
as she was
the first night I met her.

01:13:12.722 --> 01:13:15.823
But, uh, they're
a wonderful couple.

01:13:15.825 --> 01:13:18.159
And I just want to say
that, uh...

01:13:18.161 --> 01:13:21.095
it's, it's, uh, really great
to see them together,

01:13:21.097 --> 01:13:23.531
and it's something
that Kath and I

01:13:23.533 --> 01:13:25.700
have wanted for Deb
for many years.

01:13:25.702 --> 01:13:27.635
And I...

01:13:27.637 --> 01:13:29.537
And I also want to say that...

01:13:29.539 --> 01:13:32.707
that, you know, I know that
if Bridget were here,

01:13:32.709 --> 01:13:35.843
she would welcome you into
our family with lots of love...

01:13:36.713 --> 01:13:39.447
just like we all have.

01:13:39.448 --> 01:13:42.182
And I just want to thank you,
Chris, for taking care of Deb.

01:16:12.035 --> 01:16:13.568
Guys, dinner.

01:16:16.039 --> 01:16:17.905
- Hello.
- Be right up, babe.

01:16:19.108 --> 01:16:20.308
Good, right. Yeah.

01:16:20.310 --> 01:16:22.643
That sounds good. That was good.

01:16:25.281 --> 01:16:27.114
You ready
for the talent show, J?

01:16:27.116 --> 01:16:29.383
Still got a long way to go.

01:16:29.384 --> 01:16:31.651
Oh, are you kidding me?
Kid was born ready.

01:16:31.654 --> 01:16:33.988
Clapton's shaking
in his boots right now.

01:16:33.990 --> 01:16:35.122
I bet.

01:16:35.124 --> 01:16:36.190
What do you want to drink, babe?

01:16:36.192 --> 01:16:37.291
I'm fine with water.

01:16:37.293 --> 01:16:38.726
Hey, did you get
your science test back?

01:16:38.728 --> 01:16:39.894
B plus.

01:16:39.896 --> 01:16:42.030
- Nice.
- See?

01:16:42.031 --> 01:16:44.165
Aren't you glad we started
studying a little more now?

01:16:44.167 --> 01:16:45.866
Are you going to go
to the dance?

01:16:45.868 --> 01:16:47.201
What dance?

01:16:47.203 --> 01:16:49.270
There's a mixer
over at the high school.

01:16:49.272 --> 01:16:50.905
Mrs. Kiefer asked me
to chaperone,

01:16:50.907 --> 01:16:52.273
but she said J hadn't bought
his ticket yet.

01:16:52.275 --> 01:16:53.841
Dances aren't really my thing.

01:16:53.843 --> 01:16:55.176
Aren't really your thing?

01:16:55.178 --> 01:16:58.679
Um. Girls, slow-dancing,
making out.

01:16:58.681 --> 01:16:59.897
Not making out.

01:16:59.898 --> 01:17:01.114
Well,
that's every guy's thing.

01:17:01.117 --> 01:17:03.150
Look. If you need any lessons,

01:17:03.152 --> 01:17:07.922
back in the day, girls used to
refer to me as "The Grind King."

01:17:07.924 --> 01:17:09.323
Did you know that, babe?

01:17:09.325 --> 01:17:11.225
You see, you just press up
against them real close

01:17:11.227 --> 01:17:12.693
- like this.
- Okay. All right, Grind King.

01:17:12.695 --> 01:17:14.028
You can sit down now.
We get the point.

01:17:14.030 --> 01:17:16.063
Show Mallory what
you got working with down.

01:17:16.065 --> 01:17:17.198
Who's Mallory?

01:17:19.902 --> 01:17:21.068
No idea.

01:17:21.971 --> 01:17:23.170
Never heard of her.

01:17:24.273 --> 01:17:25.840
Well, I think you should go.

01:17:25.842 --> 01:17:27.375
I think a lot of girls are going
to be disappointed

01:17:27.377 --> 01:17:28.643
if you don't show up.

01:17:28.645 --> 01:17:29.844
Oh, yeah, right.

01:17:34.684 --> 01:17:35.750
Thank you.

01:17:45.395 --> 01:17:48.195
Okay, everybody calm down.
This...

01:17:48.197 --> 01:17:50.297
contract is not
what you deserve.

01:17:50.299 --> 01:17:51.866
So, what do we do?

01:17:52.902 --> 01:17:54.335
You walk out.

01:17:54.337 --> 01:17:55.787
Strike.

01:17:55.788 --> 01:17:57.238
And the people in
the big offices out in Phoenix

01:17:57.240 --> 01:18:00.274
are going to wait for you
to blink first. Don't do it.

01:18:00.276 --> 01:18:02.176
And the first contract offer
they send through

01:18:02.178 --> 01:18:03.277
will be a shitty one.

01:18:03.279 --> 01:18:04.378
Don't take it.

01:18:04.380 --> 01:18:07.348
You stay strong, stay together.

01:18:07.350 --> 01:18:09.316
Remember how we did it
in 2012, Lorraine?

01:18:09.318 --> 01:18:11.252
Yeah. We didn't break.

01:18:11.254 --> 01:18:13.554
It's the only way,

01:18:13.555 --> 01:18:15.855
the only way that
they will take you seriously.

01:18:15.858 --> 01:18:18.693
And what about you, Deb?
Doesn't that put you in a bind?

01:18:18.695 --> 01:18:20.428
It will, but we'll manage.

01:18:20.430 --> 01:18:22.997
We'll just dump all
of the extra work on Shawna.

01:18:22.999 --> 01:18:24.098
Oh, really?

01:18:25.368 --> 01:18:26.967
I don't think so. Um...

01:18:26.969 --> 01:18:29.804
No, no, no. We'll bring
in some per diem nurses

01:18:29.806 --> 01:18:31.872
to sort of bridge the gap
if we need to.

01:18:31.874 --> 01:18:33.714
We'll be fine.
We'll be fine.

01:18:41.967 --> 01:18:43.395
What time are you guys
taking off on Saturday?

01:18:43.419 --> 01:18:44.719
Eight.

01:18:45.788 --> 01:18:47.354
Can't come with us?

01:18:47.356 --> 01:18:49.457
God, I wish.

01:18:49.459 --> 01:18:52.493
I got that flip project out
on Providence Road

01:18:52.495 --> 01:18:55.196
we're scrambling to...
finish up.

01:18:55.198 --> 01:18:56.997
You're working too hard.

01:18:59.836 --> 01:19:02.803
Maybe we can go on a trip,
you know,

01:19:02.805 --> 01:19:04.839
just you and I.

01:19:04.841 --> 01:19:08.242
Jeb's got that timeshare down
in Clearwater.

01:19:08.244 --> 01:19:09.977
What about New Mexico?

01:19:11.748 --> 01:19:13.247
What about New Mexico?

01:19:14.984 --> 01:19:17.151
I saw this travel program
the other day.

01:19:17.153 --> 01:19:19.103
Mm-hm.

01:19:19.104 --> 01:19:21.054
People were hiking
along the Rio Grande.

01:19:22.158 --> 01:19:26.127
There was art,
like these incredible...

01:19:26.129 --> 01:19:30.131
ancient paintings on the walls
of these caves and...

01:19:31.768 --> 01:19:34.135
I don't know. It spoke to me.

01:19:34.137 --> 01:19:35.903
Yeah, what did it say?

01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:42.977
"Come to me, Chris and Deb."

01:19:42.979 --> 01:19:47.114
Well, you say it like
that then... yeah.

01:19:47.116 --> 01:19:48.249
Yeah?

01:19:49.185 --> 01:19:51.185
Yeah. Why the hell not?

01:19:51.187 --> 01:19:52.887
I'm going to bed.

01:19:54.824 --> 01:19:55.990
Love you.

01:19:58.895 --> 01:20:00.239
Come on, babe.
We'll hit traffic.

01:20:00.240 --> 01:20:01.584
- All right, hey.
- Got everything there?

01:20:01.585 --> 01:20:02.929
- Take that, Terry.
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

01:20:02.932 --> 01:20:04.120
Did you double-check?

01:20:04.121 --> 01:20:05.309
- Drive well.
- For the stove?

01:20:05.310 --> 01:20:06.498
- Bye, sweetheart. I love you.
- Love you.

01:20:06.502 --> 01:20:08.068
Call me when
you get there, Jesse.

01:20:08.070 --> 01:20:09.070
We will.

01:20:10.173 --> 01:20:11.438
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:12.940
Miss you.

01:20:12.942 --> 01:20:14.041
Bye, Kath.

01:20:14.043 --> 01:20:15.176
Pack a hoagie
for the road?

01:20:16.412 --> 01:20:17.478
See you.

01:20:52.381 --> 01:20:54.381
- There she is.
- There's the lake.

01:21:01.424 --> 01:21:02.523
About time.

01:21:02.525 --> 01:21:04.291
Hey.

01:21:04.293 --> 01:21:05.526
Are you drinking a beer?

01:21:05.528 --> 01:21:06.994
It's spring break.

01:21:06.996 --> 01:21:08.896
- So?
- So this is the first of many.

01:21:08.898 --> 01:21:09.964
Oh, honey.

01:21:12.368 --> 01:21:13.567
How's college life?

01:21:13.569 --> 01:21:15.402
- It's, it's amazing.
- Yeah?

01:21:15.404 --> 01:21:17.271
- It's amazing?
- Yeah, we'll see how

01:21:17.273 --> 01:21:18.823
amazing it is when
we get his grades.

01:21:18.824 --> 01:21:20.374
Oh, no, no, no.
We're not doing that.

01:21:20.376 --> 01:21:22.176
We're not talking about school.

01:21:22.178 --> 01:21:23.444
No! No, wait, put me down!

01:21:23.446 --> 01:21:25.029
You're going to have
fun on this trip

01:21:25.030 --> 01:21:26.613
- whether you like it or not!
- Guys, my sunglasses!

01:21:26.616 --> 01:21:28.916
Grab them! Grab them! Grab them!

01:21:28.918 --> 01:21:31.552
No, you guys, don't. No!

01:21:31.554 --> 01:21:33.587
Don't you dare! Don't you dare!

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.200
Get her a drink!

01:21:46.202 --> 01:21:47.601
Mom said
you forced her to go

01:21:47.603 --> 01:21:49.270
to Bingo at the home last night.

01:21:50.072 --> 01:21:51.171
She seemed pretty down

01:21:51.173 --> 01:21:52.606
when I was over there
on Wednesday.

01:21:52.607 --> 01:21:54.040
I think that stroke
took more out of her

01:21:54.043 --> 01:21:55.826
than she's willing to admit.

01:21:55.827 --> 01:21:57.610
I keep telling her,
she can move in with us.

01:21:57.613 --> 01:22:00.147
- We've got two rooms upstairs.
- I know.

01:22:00.149 --> 01:22:02.249
Terry's friend said
he would build a ramp

01:22:02.251 --> 01:22:03.517
outside for her wheelchair.

01:22:03.519 --> 01:22:05.119
She doesn't want to be
a burden, you know?

01:22:05.121 --> 01:22:07.488
I think she's
a little embarrassed.

01:22:07.490 --> 01:22:09.623
Why is she embarrassed?

01:22:09.625 --> 01:22:12.126
She's been independent
her whole life,

01:22:12.128 --> 01:22:14.395
and suddenly,
she has to rely on other people.

01:22:14.397 --> 01:22:16.263
It's... It's not easy
on her, Kath.

01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:53.267
I spoke to someone before.

01:22:53.268 --> 01:22:55.748
I'm being charged for something
that I returned two months ago.

01:22:56.072 --> 01:22:57.405
Yeah.

01:22:57.406 --> 01:22:58.739
<i>Do you know the account number?</i>

01:22:58.741 --> 01:23:00.708
I don't know the account...
Where is the account number?

01:23:00.710 --> 01:23:03.043
<i>It should be
on the upper right-hand corner.</i>

01:23:03.045 --> 01:23:05.045
Hey, Chris,
where's the Sears bill?

01:23:06.115 --> 01:23:08.382
Oh, shit, I might've tossed it.

01:23:08.384 --> 01:23:09.550
<i>Do you have it?</i>

01:23:09.552 --> 01:23:11.192
I'm going to have
to call you back.

01:23:12.555 --> 01:23:14.021
Why did you throw it out?

01:24:01.170 --> 01:24:02.703
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:24:03.406 --> 01:24:04.638
Everything okay?

01:24:05.174 --> 01:24:06.573
Yeah.

01:24:06.575 --> 01:24:09.676
Well, I have some good news.
Corporate called.

01:24:09.678 --> 01:24:11.512
They're sending over
the new contract offer

01:24:11.514 --> 01:24:13.313
to the nurses this afternoon.

01:24:14.383 --> 01:24:15.649
We won, Deb.

01:24:15.651 --> 01:24:17.618
- Oh, my god.
- We did it.

01:24:20.222 --> 01:24:22.089
Will you let everyone know?

01:24:22.091 --> 01:24:23.490
Sure.

01:24:23.492 --> 01:24:24.825
You sure you're okay?

01:24:27.129 --> 01:24:29.763
- That's such good news.
- It is.

01:24:29.765 --> 01:24:31.632
- Well done.
- You, too.

01:24:41.510 --> 01:24:43.327
- Hey.
<i>- Hey, babe.</i>

01:24:43.328 --> 01:24:45.145
<i>Hey, I just wanted to call.
We're running a little behind.</i>

01:24:45.147 --> 01:24:47.748
- <i>I'm not sure...</i>
- What time will you be home?

01:24:47.750 --> 01:24:51.618
<i>Not that late.
Love you, babe.</i>

01:24:51.620 --> 01:24:52.753
Love you, too.

01:26:21.744 --> 01:26:22.809
Hey.

01:26:25.181 --> 01:26:26.413
What's with the bags?

01:26:28.751 --> 01:26:30.584
How long has it been going on?

01:26:34.223 --> 01:26:35.422
Been going on?

01:26:37.426 --> 01:26:39.226
I saw you at her house.

01:26:40.296 --> 01:26:41.428
How long?

01:26:42.598 --> 01:26:44.331
No, Deb, I can explain...

01:26:44.333 --> 01:26:46.533
Do you really want me
to scream and yell

01:26:46.535 --> 01:26:48.502
and throw my fucking glass
against the wall?

01:26:48.504 --> 01:26:49.736
Do you want me to do that?

01:26:49.738 --> 01:26:51.872
- Because I fucking will.
- Hey, she...

01:26:51.874 --> 01:26:52.973
She's just...

01:26:54.743 --> 01:26:56.663
- Whatever you think you saw...
- Chris.

01:27:10.659 --> 01:27:12.259
Six months.

01:27:15.731 --> 01:27:16.863
Tops.

01:27:22.771 --> 01:27:23.870
Who is she?

01:27:28.978 --> 01:27:30.644
Her name is Sarah.

01:27:33.249 --> 01:27:35.315
I met her at a bar
in Wilmington.

01:27:38.988 --> 01:27:40.254
Why?

01:27:42.258 --> 01:27:43.757
- Deb...
- Why?

01:27:44.827 --> 01:27:46.426
What didn't I give you?

01:27:51.333 --> 01:27:52.432
It's...

01:27:52.901 --> 01:27:54.001
Hey.

01:27:54.603 --> 01:27:55.736
Hey, bud.

01:27:57.039 --> 01:27:59.006
What did you do?

01:27:59.008 --> 01:28:01.308
I'm just going to go away
for a little while.

01:28:01.710 --> 01:28:02.776
Hey, J.

01:28:17.393 --> 01:28:18.458
Deb.

01:28:45.554 --> 01:28:46.687
Is she pretty?

01:28:46.989 --> 01:28:48.055
Mm-hm.

01:28:48.657 --> 01:28:50.023
Nice tits, too.

01:28:51.627 --> 01:28:52.826
- Shit.
- Mm-hm.

01:28:53.796 --> 01:28:55.495
Really nice tits.

01:28:57.433 --> 01:28:59.433
Well, you're not crying.
That's good.

01:28:59.435 --> 01:29:03.670
Oh, I will, eventually.
It'll all come pouring out.

01:29:03.672 --> 01:29:05.939
Right now, I have
to chaperone this damn thing.

01:29:07.876 --> 01:29:10.110
- Too tired.
- Whoa! Look at you.

01:29:10.112 --> 01:29:11.411
So handsome.

01:29:12.781 --> 01:29:14.047
All right. I'm going.

01:29:59.628 --> 01:30:02.028
Hey, Mom.
Mom, it's Deborah.

01:30:04.099 --> 01:30:05.465
Hey, Mom?

01:30:09.638 --> 01:30:10.737
Mom?

01:30:11.707 --> 01:30:12.939
Mom!

01:30:13.642 --> 01:30:15.509
What? What?

01:30:15.511 --> 01:30:16.710
Oh, Jesus Christ.

01:30:18.013 --> 01:30:20.080
Nothing. I just thought
for a second...

01:30:20.749 --> 01:30:22.949
I'm not dead.

01:30:22.951 --> 01:30:25.018
- Yeah?
- I'm sorry to interrupt.

01:30:25.020 --> 01:30:27.888
Deb, there's a Detective Morris
here to see you.

01:30:29.992 --> 01:30:32.092
You go.
I'll sit with your mother.

01:31:25.747 --> 01:31:27.247
<i>As you know, last week,</i>

01:31:27.249 --> 01:31:29.950
<i>we arrested Frank Gerald Derrick
of Eddystone</i>

01:31:29.952 --> 01:31:33.153
<i>and charged him with kidnapping
and murder of Amanda Butler.</i>

01:31:33.155 --> 01:31:36.122
<i>While interviewing Mr. Derrick,
he subsequently confessed...</i>

01:31:36.124 --> 01:31:38.992
<i>to the kidnapping and murder
of three other victims.</i>

01:31:38.994 --> 01:31:41.411
<i>With Mr. Derrick's cooperation,</i>

01:31:41.412 --> 01:31:43.829
<i>we have located the remains of
Jessica Edmonds, Kelly Ryerson,</i>

01:31:43.832 --> 01:31:45.098
<i>and Bridget Callahan.</i>

01:31:46.201 --> 01:31:47.534
<i>We'll take questions now.</i>

01:31:55.010 --> 01:31:56.109
My name is Deb Callahan.

01:31:56.110 --> 01:31:57.209
Your husband murdered
my daughter.

01:31:57.212 --> 01:31:58.879
I want to speak with him.

01:31:58.881 --> 01:32:00.547
- Please go away.
- I'm... Don't touch me.

01:32:00.549 --> 01:32:01.832
Don't fucking touch me.

01:32:01.833 --> 01:32:03.116
I want to know
what happened to my daughter.

01:32:03.118 --> 01:32:04.584
Please just leave us alone.

01:32:04.586 --> 01:32:05.652
I'm not going to do that.

01:32:05.654 --> 01:32:06.820
I am not going
to stop coming here

01:32:06.822 --> 01:32:08.222
until you let me speak to him.

01:32:08.223 --> 01:32:09.623
You have to let me
speak to your husband.

01:32:09.625 --> 01:32:11.258
I need to know what happened
to my daughter.

01:32:11.260 --> 01:32:12.826
I am begging you to tell me.

01:32:12.828 --> 01:32:14.027
Get him to speak to me.

01:32:14.029 --> 01:32:16.069
I need to know what happened
to my daughter.

01:32:18.967 --> 01:32:20.634
I'm begging you.

01:32:20.636 --> 01:32:22.102
I'm begging you.

01:32:22.104 --> 01:32:23.236
I'm begging you!

01:32:24.106 --> 01:32:25.171
Goddamn it.

01:33:03.111 --> 01:33:05.045
Hello?

01:33:05.046 --> 01:33:06.980
<i>Deb,
it's Detective Morris. I...</i>

01:33:06.982 --> 01:33:09.849
<i>I got word from
the DA's office this morning.</i>

01:33:09.851 --> 01:33:11.918
<i>Frank Derrick's
going to meet with you today.</i>

01:33:12.688 --> 01:33:13.820
What time?

01:33:14.590 --> 01:33:15.922
<i>5:00 p.m.</i>

01:33:17.626 --> 01:33:18.725
Okay.

01:33:19.861 --> 01:33:20.961
<i>Okay.</i>

01:36:42.063 --> 01:36:43.163
You okay?

01:36:44.466 --> 01:36:46.065
Think so.

01:36:46.067 --> 01:36:49.068
Deb, you go.
We'll stay back here.

01:36:57.345 --> 01:36:59.078
You want to stay here, sweetie?

01:37:03.218 --> 01:37:04.551
No, I want to go with you.

01:40:51.513 --> 01:40:53.813
Yeah, so four dollars?

01:40:53.815 --> 01:40:56.049
- Four bucks.
- Do you want to...

01:40:56.051 --> 01:40:57.250
Let me get my bag.

01:40:59.721 --> 01:41:01.821
We can see how many
are in there.

01:41:01.823 --> 01:41:04.724
I have four bucks left,
so, you know?

01:41:04.726 --> 01:41:06.846
- I'll do them for four.
- Okay.

01:41:07.829 --> 01:41:09.128
Hey.

01:41:11.466 --> 01:41:13.066
How are you doing, bud?

01:41:13.068 --> 01:41:14.434
Good, good.

01:41:14.436 --> 01:41:16.102
Good to see you.

01:41:16.104 --> 01:41:17.336
Studying hard?

01:41:17.338 --> 01:41:19.138
Yeah.

01:41:19.140 --> 01:41:20.673
I got a girlfriend now.

01:41:20.675 --> 01:41:22.375
Yeah?

01:41:22.377 --> 01:41:23.810
You talking about Mallory?

01:41:23.812 --> 01:41:26.179
We made out for the first time
at the mixer.

01:41:26.181 --> 01:41:27.680
Nice.

01:41:27.682 --> 01:41:31.217
See, "The Grind King's"
rubbing off on you a little.

01:41:31.219 --> 01:41:32.685
Isn't she going
to be heartbroken

01:41:32.687 --> 01:41:34.087
now that you're leaving town?

01:41:34.089 --> 01:41:35.655
I told her we'd be back
for the holidays.

01:41:35.657 --> 01:41:37.223
She said she'd wait for me.

01:41:38.259 --> 01:41:39.525
Good for you.

01:41:39.527 --> 01:41:41.094
Why don't you go help that lady?

01:41:45.133 --> 01:41:46.833
What are you doing here, Chris?

01:41:48.269 --> 01:41:50.403
Well, you won't meet up with me.

01:41:50.405 --> 01:41:52.238
You won't return my calls.

01:41:52.240 --> 01:41:54.807
Figured that this might be
my last chance

01:41:54.809 --> 01:41:56.375
to see you before you took off.

01:41:58.780 --> 01:42:00.113
How's it going?

01:42:01.249 --> 01:42:03.216
Seventy-eight dollars so far.

01:42:03.218 --> 01:42:05.551
Should get us as far
as Harrisburg at least.

01:42:08.356 --> 01:42:10.189
Anything set up out there?

01:42:10.191 --> 01:42:11.557
Not really.

01:42:11.559 --> 01:42:13.626
Year lease on
a two-bedroom place.

01:42:18.900 --> 01:42:21.767
Well, you know, maybe I could...

01:42:22.670 --> 01:42:24.604
take a trip out there sometime,

01:42:25.640 --> 01:42:27.740
you know, get out of the cold.

01:42:27.742 --> 01:42:30.376
Spend some time with J and...

01:42:30.378 --> 01:42:31.744
you too, if...

01:42:31.746 --> 01:42:33.779
you know, if that's...
that's all right.

01:42:38.820 --> 01:42:40.319
I still love you, Deb.

01:42:41.422 --> 01:42:43.189
That never changed.

01:42:52.834 --> 01:42:54.901
Well, let me at least
buy something.

01:42:55.770 --> 01:42:57.587
All right?

01:42:57.588 --> 01:42:59.588
Got an entire apartment
I need to fill, anyway.

01:43:00.275 --> 01:43:01.741
What will it be?

01:43:01.743 --> 01:43:03.176
How much for this?

01:43:03.945 --> 01:43:05.278
Fifteen.

01:43:10.885 --> 01:43:12.785
- Oh. Keep it.
- Thank you.

01:43:12.787 --> 01:43:15.321
Push you past the
Harrisburg city limits at least.

01:43:15.323 --> 01:43:16.589
That should help.

01:43:22.397 --> 01:43:23.596
Goodbye, Chris.

01:44:33.468 --> 01:44:34.734
You ready, kiddo?

01:44:36.971 --> 01:44:38.638
Okay, J.

01:44:38.640 --> 01:44:40.006
You call me every
couple of hours,

01:44:40.008 --> 01:44:42.088
because you know your
grandmother's going to forget.

01:44:43.511 --> 01:44:45.071
- I love you.
- Love you, too.

01:44:49.384 --> 01:44:50.983
- Bye, Gran.
- Bye.

01:44:52.320 --> 01:44:53.486
God bless.

01:44:55.723 --> 01:44:56.956
Good luck, bud.

01:45:04.866 --> 01:45:07.433
Well, this is it, Mom.

01:45:07.435 --> 01:45:09.935
The moment you've been waiting
for for 40 years.

01:45:11.005 --> 01:45:12.538
Cut it out.

01:45:20.515 --> 01:45:21.714
My heart.

01:45:25.486 --> 01:45:27.086
Okay, you first.

01:45:28.589 --> 01:45:30.523
Safe travels, Deb.

01:45:30.525 --> 01:45:31.824
Love you.

01:45:34.329 --> 01:45:36.595
You keep my sister busy, okay?

01:45:36.597 --> 01:45:38.597
I thought that was your job.

01:45:56.918 --> 01:46:01.387
I love you. I love you.
I love you.

01:46:29.384 --> 01:46:30.583
Buckle up.
