WEBVTT

01:20.497 --> 01:22.290
What the hell happened down there?

01:22.373 --> 01:26.086
At first, we thought maybe impact
from one of those meteors, but…

01:27.462 --> 01:30.507
no meteor would be large enough
to create that kind of destruction.

01:30.590 --> 01:31.508
Agreed.

01:32.801 --> 01:33.802
Then what did?

01:38.014 --> 01:40.767
Okay, everyone, I don't wanna stay here
longer than we need to.

01:40.850 --> 01:42.977
-Will, make sure the robot's ready.
-Yeah.

01:43.061 --> 01:45.271
Penny, can you check on the kids, please?

01:45.814 --> 01:47.315
Wait, hold on.

01:47.398 --> 01:50.026
Sorry, Will has one job,
and I have 97 jobs?

01:50.110 --> 01:52.487
-You're better with the kids than he is.
-Hey!

01:53.238 --> 01:55.949
Sorry, it's just
they're a little intimidated by you.

01:56.449 --> 01:58.785
-Really? Have they met Will?

01:58.868 --> 02:00.787
Yes, well, Will has a robot.

02:01.287 --> 02:03.248
Uh, well, Penny has a strong boyfriend.

02:03.331 --> 02:06.209
And which one of your boyfriends
is the strong one again?

02:06.292 --> 02:10.130
-Okay, I don't care for either of you.
-Next stop, Alpha Centauri.

02:18.429 --> 02:20.348
It was once the greatest ship ever built.

02:22.058 --> 02:24.435
Never even had a chance
to complete her mission.

02:24.936 --> 02:25.937
Mmm.

02:27.438 --> 02:29.566
Well, she kept you and your crew alive.

02:31.734 --> 02:34.904
Life's not just about survival.
It's about making a difference.

02:35.864 --> 02:38.074
So when you're all done, you can say,

02:39.284 --> 02:40.243
"I did that."

02:42.120 --> 02:45.331
-Look, about what happened earlier--
-Happened. Past tense.

02:46.666 --> 02:48.042
No need to dwell on it.

02:50.044 --> 02:51.045
Let's just move on.

02:57.051 --> 02:57.969
Understood.

03:03.224 --> 03:05.143
Yeah, that looks good. Okay.

03:22.285 --> 03:24.996
I thought we said
no loose items during flight.

03:25.622 --> 03:29.709
Sorry. It's just… my mom says
if you ever get nervous,

03:29.792 --> 03:31.586
just stay focused on the goal.

03:33.755 --> 03:37.508
Well, then we're just going to have to do
a better job of tucking that in.

03:44.724 --> 03:47.310
When I was in the ruins,
I recorded these sounds.

03:51.940 --> 03:54.192
I think it might be some kind of language,

03:54.734 --> 03:56.486
made by whoever built you.

03:57.612 --> 03:58.947
Do you know what it's saying?

04:04.452 --> 04:08.998
Look, I know you don't remember much
about the way you were before, but…

04:10.250 --> 04:13.044
do you understand what I mean
when I talk about programming?

04:13.544 --> 04:17.632
It's the way we tell a machine,
like a computer, what we want it to do.

04:20.051 --> 04:22.136
Yes, Will Robinson.

04:22.220 --> 04:27.141
So, what if these sounds
are how they controlled the robots?

04:27.225 --> 04:29.477
And if so, maybe one could even stop them.

04:29.560 --> 04:32.188
-Or at least slow them down--
-Hey, lazy butts.

04:32.272 --> 04:34.899
I would like to point out
that my 97 things are done,

04:34.983 --> 04:37.235
and your one thing
still hasn't turned on the map.

04:37.318 --> 04:38.152
Sorry.

04:38.778 --> 04:39.696
Go ahead.

04:40.238 --> 04:43.449
We'll have time to finish working
on this problem on Alpha Centauri.

04:48.413 --> 04:49.539
What's the problem?

04:50.039 --> 04:52.417
Oh, nothing. It's a robot thing.

04:52.500 --> 04:54.127
Don't pull the robot card on me.

04:54.210 --> 04:56.713
I'm not.
Since when did you get to be so nosy?

04:56.796 --> 04:59.340
-First of all, I've always been nosy.

04:59.424 --> 05:01.092
-Second of all--
-Hold on.

05:08.266 --> 05:10.727
What? What is he doing?

05:11.227 --> 05:14.480
His lights are… turning on.

05:17.233 --> 05:18.609
Like in the ruins.

05:19.694 --> 05:21.362
Is he connecting to Scarecrow?

05:22.905 --> 05:23.781
Mom?

05:24.866 --> 05:26.242
Dad, are you there?

05:36.794 --> 05:37.920
Hello?

05:38.004 --> 05:39.714
Why isn't anybody answering?

05:52.268 --> 05:54.854
Hey. What's taking so long?

05:59.025 --> 06:02.195
That's not Alpha Centauri, is it?

06:03.905 --> 06:05.531
No, it's not.

06:11.454 --> 06:13.623
Robot, what are you doing?

06:13.706 --> 06:16.793
Will, tell the robot to stop.
That's not where we wanna go.

06:16.876 --> 06:19.587
Wait. Those are Jupiters.
That's our parents.

06:40.108 --> 06:41.567
Danger.

06:42.151 --> 06:43.611
Family.

06:44.904 --> 06:47.782
Why would Mom and Dad wanna show us this?

06:47.865 --> 06:48.825
They're not.

06:50.993 --> 06:51.911
SAR is.

06:56.916 --> 06:57.959
Hey. Hey.

06:58.626 --> 07:00.586
-Hey.

07:22.525 --> 07:23.901
Scarecrow's gone,

07:25.194 --> 07:26.279
isn't he?

07:29.949 --> 07:31.200
I'm so sorry.

07:46.507 --> 07:49.385
Can someone please explain to me
what just happened?

07:50.178 --> 07:52.430
<i>Incoming enemy hostiles.</i>

07:52.930 --> 07:55.349
I thought we'd be safe in the suns.
What changed?

07:55.850 --> 07:56.934
Scarecrow.

07:58.561 --> 08:01.105
The robot that helped our children escape

08:01.189 --> 08:04.192
was trying to help us, too,
when he was captured.

08:04.275 --> 08:06.944
Which means the robots know
everything that Scarecrow knew,

08:07.028 --> 08:08.488
which includes our location.

08:08.571 --> 08:11.365
-Did he know where our kids are?
-We're assuming no.

08:11.449 --> 08:12.617
Why's that?

08:12.700 --> 08:14.911
If he did, those ships
wouldn't be headed for us.

08:14.994 --> 08:16.245
How far out are they?

08:16.329 --> 08:17.997
-Thirty minutes.
-Thirty minutes…

08:18.080 --> 08:20.917
West, how long will it take your crew
to decouple the Jupiters?

08:21.000 --> 08:23.336
I feel like you want me to say
less than 30 minutes.

08:23.419 --> 08:25.922
Even if our Jupiters were
operating at full capacity,

08:26.005 --> 08:28.424
which they're not,
we can't outrun those ships.

08:29.050 --> 08:30.968
They'll pick us off one by one.

08:31.052 --> 08:34.096
-Let's talk alternatives.
-If we can't outrun them,

08:34.180 --> 08:36.724
we find a way to take them out,
like we did on the Resolute.

08:39.393 --> 08:41.521
Problem is we're not on the Resolute.

08:42.813 --> 08:44.690
There are no places to hide here.

08:46.067 --> 08:49.946
No EMFs to slow them down.
No weapons to defend ourselves with.

08:50.530 --> 08:53.741
The last time we faced the robots,
we threw everything we had at them,

08:53.824 --> 08:55.952
including the Resolute,
and they still found us.

08:56.035 --> 08:59.580
-Then we have to think outside the box.
-We can't save ourselves.

09:06.128 --> 09:10.424
The faster we accept that, the faster
we can focus on the people we can save.

09:12.176 --> 09:13.094
Our kids.

09:19.559 --> 09:22.103
When SAR gets here,
he's gonna tear the Jupiters apart

09:22.186 --> 09:24.272
to try and find the location
of Alpha Centauri,

09:24.355 --> 09:27.066
where our kids are headed with his engine.

09:27.775 --> 09:32.572
Anything that might be a clue,
hardware, software, maps, even photos,

09:32.655 --> 09:34.073
all of it has to be destroyed.

09:35.116 --> 09:38.244
We'll make teams, disconnect
the shredders from the 3D printers,

09:38.327 --> 09:42.415
and disable fire safety systems
so that we can do burns in the garage.

09:42.498 --> 09:43.416
On it.

09:43.499 --> 09:45.918
And wipe the flight data
from the ship's hard drives.

09:46.002 --> 09:47.420
I can help with that.

09:47.503 --> 09:49.297
I've got a few degaussers.

09:50.548 --> 09:51.716
Why would you have those?

09:51.799 --> 09:55.428
Let's just say that in my previous life,
I had to cover my tracks once.

09:55.511 --> 09:57.805
And by once, I mean 24 times.

09:57.888 --> 09:59.223
Which is a good thing,

09:59.932 --> 10:02.143
'cause if we leave any scraps behind,

10:03.060 --> 10:04.979
all the sacrifices that we made,

10:05.855 --> 10:09.066
all the lives that have been lost,
will have been for nothing.

10:10.735 --> 10:12.737
Our children's lives depend on us.

10:14.280 --> 10:15.281
Let's get started.

10:23.039 --> 10:24.206
All this has to go!

10:24.999 --> 10:26.459
-Clear.
-Right.

10:35.092 --> 10:37.136
-You're a teacher, right?
-Yes. Biology.

10:37.219 --> 10:39.430
We need your lesson plans,
lecture notes, all of it.

10:39.513 --> 10:40.389
Seriously?

10:40.890 --> 10:44.310
Information about the natural resources
on Alpha Centauri goes in the bag.

10:56.155 --> 10:58.491
Just don't stop until you get
a solid green light.

10:58.574 --> 11:01.285
-Hurry. Here, go with him.
-Where's that bag?

11:01.369 --> 11:03.204
-Get this shredded.
-I always wondered

11:03.287 --> 11:05.665
how you managed to get your goods
past the allotment system.

11:05.748 --> 11:08.918
I also wondered why the allotment system
was constantly malfunctioning.

11:09.001 --> 11:11.504
Stay focused.
Stop thinking about the past.

11:12.421 --> 11:14.340
<i>Welcome to Alpha Centauri.</i>

11:14.423 --> 11:16.717
<i>-Welcome to your new life.</i>

11:16.801 --> 11:21.389
<i>It's been a long journey for you,</i>
<i>almost 26 trillion miles.</i>

11:21.472 --> 11:22.515
<i>But you are home now.</i>

11:22.598 --> 11:24.016
I wish to hell we were.

11:25.267 --> 11:27.144
-<i>You've joined a community</i>

11:27.228 --> 11:29.855
<i>of the best and brightest</i>
<i>Earth has to offer,</i>

11:30.523 --> 11:32.358
<i>-dedicated to building…</i>

11:32.441 --> 11:33.693
At least we know now.

11:35.069 --> 11:37.530
-What do you mean?
-About the kids.

11:38.906 --> 11:42.118
You said the hardest part
was the not knowing. We know now.

11:42.201 --> 11:43.119
They're okay.

11:45.413 --> 11:47.623
-They're gonna make it there.

11:49.291 --> 11:50.793
Even if we aren't.

11:56.340 --> 11:58.509
I think everybody's
pretty spooked.

11:58.592 --> 12:00.469
That's exactly what SAR wants.

12:01.971 --> 12:03.472
We don't know what he wants.

12:03.556 --> 12:05.641
Yes, we do. He wants the engine.

12:05.725 --> 12:09.353
He knows that if he threatens our parents,
then we'll go there and give it to him.

12:09.854 --> 12:11.981
What if he's after more
than just our engine?

12:12.648 --> 12:14.775
He could be after a ham sandwich,
for all I care.

12:14.859 --> 12:16.902
He's gonna kill our parents.
We can't let that happen.

12:16.986 --> 12:19.071
Hold on. We have to think things through.

12:19.613 --> 12:20.740
No, Vijay's right.

12:21.282 --> 12:22.199
He is?

12:22.783 --> 12:25.661
Sorry, I think that's
the first time you've ever said that.

12:25.745 --> 12:29.039
Guys, SAR didn't just make a threat.
He just made a mistake.

12:29.540 --> 12:32.752
He just showed us where our parents are.
Their exact coordinates.

12:32.835 --> 12:36.672
-So we can go get them. Use the robot--
-It's not a mistake, Penny. It's a trap.

12:38.048 --> 12:41.761
I was given direct orders to take us
to Alpha Centauri from our parents.

12:41.844 --> 12:43.471
From everyone's parents.

12:43.971 --> 12:46.182
People who put their trust in me
to get us there.

12:46.265 --> 12:49.143
-They would want us to at least try.
-No. They wanted one thing.

12:49.226 --> 12:51.020
For us to get to the colony safely.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.314
What about what <i>we </i>want?

12:54.190 --> 12:56.108
I wanna save my parents.

13:02.573 --> 13:03.491
Noah…

13:05.075 --> 13:06.160
everyone,

13:07.119 --> 13:11.332
there is a big difference
between wanting to save our parents

13:11.415 --> 13:13.459
and actually pulling it off.

13:13.542 --> 13:15.669
We lack any element of surprise.

13:15.753 --> 13:19.298
SAR knows that we're coming.
And the second we get there, he's gonna…

13:20.883 --> 13:23.344
he's gonna send
everything he's got after us.

13:35.648 --> 13:37.066
I still want to try.

13:39.193 --> 13:40.194
Yeah.

13:43.864 --> 13:44.698
Me too.

14:32.830 --> 14:34.248
-Hey.
-Hey.

14:41.046 --> 14:41.964
You need anything?

14:46.051 --> 14:47.511
Yeah. Actually, I do.

14:48.679 --> 14:52.141
There's no way that we can outrun SAR.
The Jupiter's not fast enough.

14:52.975 --> 14:57.313
Our technology versus theirs. Our one ship
versus how many of theirs? It--

14:57.897 --> 15:00.065
I just don't see how it's possible.

15:00.900 --> 15:01.734
You're right.

15:02.943 --> 15:06.030
Not even the best pilot or computer
can do what you're asking.

15:06.989 --> 15:07.907
Hey.

15:09.575 --> 15:10.492
You okay?

15:14.705 --> 15:16.916
<i>But there's one thing</i>
<i>my mother would tell me</i>

15:16.999 --> 15:19.043
<i>when the bullies</i>
<i>would chase me after school.</i>

15:19.752 --> 15:24.173
"If you're not faster than them,
then you damn well better be smarter."

15:25.758 --> 15:26.967
And from what I've seen,

15:27.051 --> 15:29.720
you've got a lot of smart people
on this ship.

15:30.304 --> 15:34.016
I know a part of you thinks
you need to be the one to solve this,

15:34.767 --> 15:35.809
but you don't.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.146
Okay? You're not alone.

15:40.898 --> 15:42.066
You're the captain.

15:43.317 --> 15:44.234
You.

15:44.860 --> 15:47.446
This isn't a democracy.
Votes don't matter.

15:47.529 --> 15:50.908
Who raises their hand, how many…
Doesn't matter.

15:52.326 --> 15:53.577
It's your call.

15:54.828 --> 15:57.081
And whatever that call is, either way…

15:58.624 --> 16:00.376
I believe it will be the right one.

16:02.044 --> 16:03.712
Every problem
has a solution, right?

16:05.172 --> 16:08.008
Look, there's a little bit of Mom
in all of us,

16:08.634 --> 16:10.719
which means, if there is a solution here,

16:10.803 --> 16:13.263
a way to save them,
the three of us can find it.

16:16.767 --> 16:17.893
Who wants to start?

16:27.069 --> 16:28.028
Judy…

16:32.533 --> 16:34.076
I think I know what to do.

16:38.706 --> 16:40.708
…with everything coming out of…

16:42.918 --> 16:44.336
Okay, is that everything?

16:45.796 --> 16:49.591
Not everything. I--
I know every-- every page, every word.

16:49.675 --> 16:51.677
Nothing in here could lead them
to Alpha Centauri.

16:51.760 --> 16:54.555
-Maureen--
-What is in here is us.

16:54.638 --> 16:55.973
It's our family, and…

16:58.100 --> 16:59.685
if this is where it ends, I…

17:06.567 --> 17:07.443
It's okay.

17:17.703 --> 17:18.704
Hey, last call.

17:18.787 --> 17:19.955
Hey. Here you are.

17:21.915 --> 17:22.791
Hey.

17:23.459 --> 17:24.293
Thank you.

17:24.376 --> 17:27.629
No. Thank you. 'Cause of you and Maureen,
my kids are gonna be safe.

17:27.713 --> 17:29.214
No, it's 'cause of all of us.

17:29.298 --> 17:31.425
<i>T-minus ten minutes</i>
<i>until arrival.</i>

17:34.053 --> 17:35.220
Better get moving.

17:38.599 --> 17:41.518
-J2, all clear. J6, prepare for pickup.

17:46.815 --> 17:49.610
Jupiter 30,
I'm headed to you with a junk trunk.

17:54.406 --> 17:56.033
-This it?
-Every last one.

17:56.116 --> 17:56.992
Okay.

18:00.287 --> 18:01.622
This is the rest!

18:03.123 --> 18:03.999
Come on.

18:05.375 --> 18:07.503
Come on! You piece of junk!

18:08.253 --> 18:09.088
God--

18:10.339 --> 18:11.799
Guess we're goin' old school.

18:13.175 --> 18:14.802
Okay. Oh!

18:15.803 --> 18:19.389
Good form! You know,
after your promotion, I was worried

18:19.473 --> 18:21.350
-you'd forgotten how to do the work!

18:21.433 --> 18:23.477
Okay! Don! Don, Don, Don!

18:23.560 --> 18:26.105
Hey, hey, hey!
We're doing the right thing!

18:26.647 --> 18:29.566
Those robots aren't gonna find
any trace of Alpha Centauri!

18:29.650 --> 18:30.901
And neither are we!

18:32.236 --> 18:35.197
Everything we've done.
Every crazy plan we tried.

18:39.243 --> 18:43.205
What was the point of giving yourself hope
for a future you're never gonna have?

18:44.123 --> 18:46.375
Hope <i>was </i>the point, Don.

18:52.881 --> 18:55.509
<i>T-minus five minutes until arrival.</i>

19:06.395 --> 19:07.229
Hey.

19:07.813 --> 19:08.939
Everything's ready.

19:09.022 --> 19:10.649
Okay. Be right there.

19:11.859 --> 19:14.111
Will, it's a good plan.

19:17.614 --> 19:18.490
Yeah.

19:20.284 --> 19:21.160
It is.

19:24.496 --> 19:25.372
Okay.

19:48.770 --> 19:51.607
This is Will Robinson
of the 24th Colonist Group.

19:52.983 --> 19:53.942
And…

19:56.612 --> 19:58.363
if you're watching this recording…

20:02.534 --> 20:04.328
…this is my final transmission.

20:11.376 --> 20:13.003
Okay, that's 100% burn.

20:13.086 --> 20:15.839
Four Chariots full, top to bottom.
Nothing but ash.

20:15.923 --> 20:17.591
Hardware's ghosted and shredded.

20:17.674 --> 20:19.301
All the Jupiters swept clean.

20:19.843 --> 20:22.346
So… that's everything.

20:23.096 --> 20:24.097
It seems so.

20:26.099 --> 20:28.018
I'm happy our children
are out there together.

20:29.603 --> 20:31.563
Vijay will be a better man because of it.

20:32.397 --> 20:33.941
He's already a good man.

20:40.364 --> 20:41.573
Excuse me.

20:43.116 --> 20:44.034
The first one.

20:45.118 --> 20:46.370
It's here.

20:57.089 --> 20:58.215
It's been an honor.

21:23.991 --> 21:28.120
Wait, we're picking up an energy spike
at the edge of the solar benchmark.

21:28.704 --> 21:29.663
An energy spike?

21:30.330 --> 21:32.749
Incoming spacecraft
bearing three-three-zero.

21:34.459 --> 21:35.961
It's a transport Jupiter.

21:44.594 --> 21:46.430
-It's the kids.
-No.

21:46.513 --> 21:49.308
-What the hell are they doing here?
-No. No!

21:51.226 --> 21:53.562
Will Robinson.

21:55.355 --> 21:57.190
They're gonna get themselves killed.

21:59.067 --> 22:02.529
Any ship ready to fly, we need you
to divert SAR away from the transport.

22:02.612 --> 22:04.072
<i>-Now!</i>
-Don West.

22:04.156 --> 22:06.825
-Already on it.
-Get ready to launch on my count.

22:06.908 --> 22:08.118
<i>Belay that order.</i>

22:09.578 --> 22:12.748
-Judy.
-Judy, what the hell are you doing?

22:13.332 --> 22:14.624
Are you crazy?

22:14.708 --> 22:17.169
Maybe, but crazy tends
to run in the family.

22:17.252 --> 22:20.213
Wait, the frequency you're on,
that's not the Jupiter.

22:20.297 --> 22:22.632
If they're not on the Jupiter,
where are they?

22:26.887 --> 22:28.096
That's impossible.

22:34.519 --> 22:36.980
<i>This is Judy Robinson,</i>
<i>on board the Fortuna,</i>

22:37.064 --> 22:38.231
<i>hailing all Jupiters.</i>

22:38.315 --> 22:42.527
We are here to assist you.
I repeat. We are here to assist you.

22:43.236 --> 22:44.946
They came through the Rift together.

22:46.490 --> 22:47.949
The Jupiter was a decoy.

22:49.368 --> 22:52.412
The Fortuna's been gone 19 years.

22:53.121 --> 22:55.332
What the hell is it doing way out here?

22:55.415 --> 22:56.666
<i>Rescuing you.</i>

22:56.750 --> 22:57.918
You're welcome.

23:07.677 --> 23:10.263
Engaging RCS. Beginning deceleration.

23:11.014 --> 23:12.474
Copy. On your mark.

23:14.851 --> 23:16.812
Prepare for docking at Jupiter 2.

23:36.540 --> 23:37.999
Oh, come on.

23:39.209 --> 23:40.377
Ah, come on!

23:41.294 --> 23:44.297
Why does this stupid door
take so long?

24:05.068 --> 24:05.944
Hey.

24:14.077 --> 24:15.871
-Oh!
-Mom! Dad!

24:16.371 --> 24:17.539
Oh!

24:18.081 --> 24:20.459
-For real this time.

24:20.959 --> 24:24.504
Dad, I know…
Look, I know you gave me an order…

24:24.588 --> 24:29.676
No, no, Judy, I gave you command.
What you did with it was always up to you.

24:33.763 --> 24:34.598
Penny.

24:35.098 --> 24:36.433
-Mom.
-Oh, baby.

24:38.685 --> 24:39.603
Hey.

24:40.437 --> 24:41.354
Where's Will?

24:44.441 --> 24:45.942
Who's flying the Jupiter?

25:06.630 --> 25:09.758
-All clear. Everyone's off the ship.

25:09.841 --> 25:10.717
Will!

25:11.510 --> 25:14.179
-Will!
-Look at you! You've got so big!

25:17.474 --> 25:20.185
Okay, I need everyone
to super-triple pinkie promise

25:20.268 --> 25:22.270
that we are never gonna separate again.

25:22.354 --> 25:24.272
-Okay? I'm serious. Promise.
-Okay.

25:24.356 --> 25:25.774
-Promise.
-I promise.

25:32.447 --> 25:35.534
That decoy's not gonna last for long.
Everybody find their family.

25:35.617 --> 25:38.036
Head back to your Jupiter.
We don't have much time.

25:38.119 --> 25:40.288
Do what your captain says.
And listen carefully.

25:40.372 --> 25:43.917
We've assigned transports to anyone
who doesn't have their own Jupiter.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.294
So A through I, you're with the Azevedos.

25:46.378 --> 25:48.380
J through Q, you're with the Dhars.

25:48.463 --> 25:50.549
The rest of you with the Watanabes.

25:51.967 --> 25:53.510
Wow. Nice suit.

25:54.261 --> 25:56.513
Okay, I leave for a year,
and you're management?

25:56.596 --> 25:58.682
Please. Captain Robinson?

25:59.432 --> 26:01.393
Or is it Dr. Robinson still?

26:01.476 --> 26:04.396
Do I call you Captain Dr. Robinson?
Dr. Captain Robinson?

26:04.479 --> 26:05.480
Just Judy.

26:06.856 --> 26:07.691
I can do that.

26:12.362 --> 26:13.738
-Okay.
-Let's go.

26:14.406 --> 26:15.991
Let's get to work, everybody. Come on.

26:16.074 --> 26:19.286
Judy, I don't understand.
How did you find the Fortuna?

26:19.828 --> 26:21.371
How did you learn how to--

26:22.706 --> 26:23.832
…gotten so big…

26:24.874 --> 26:25.709
Grant.

26:29.170 --> 26:31.172
How are you here?

26:31.256 --> 26:33.258
I'm still trying
to figure that out myself.

26:33.758 --> 26:36.678
When we lost communication,
everyone assumed the worst.

26:36.761 --> 26:39.389
And I-- I mean,
there was no way to know, but I--

26:40.307 --> 26:43.101
What? How did you find our kids?

26:44.019 --> 26:45.186
They found me.

26:45.270 --> 26:48.690
<i>Attention. The alien ship</i>
<i>has reached the transport.</i>

26:48.773 --> 26:49.858
-I--
-All right.

26:49.941 --> 26:51.735
We need to detach as soon as we're ready.

26:51.818 --> 26:54.988
-See you all on the Alpha Centauri.
-I-- I'm sorry. I--

26:55.989 --> 26:56.865
Of course.

26:57.490 --> 27:01.077
Penny? The drives have been scraped,
so we need to boot comms manually.

27:01.161 --> 27:02.203
Okay.

27:02.287 --> 27:03.163
-Don.
-Yeah.

27:03.246 --> 27:05.582
-We need to uncouple from the base now.
-On it.

27:05.665 --> 27:08.126
-Where's Robot?
-He's still on the Fortuna.

27:08.209 --> 27:11.046
No time to transfer the engine.
Tell him to open the Rift from there.

27:11.129 --> 27:13.548
-And hold it until we get through.
-What?

27:13.632 --> 27:14.924
I-- I just missed this.

27:27.854 --> 27:29.147
This one stays with us.

27:29.230 --> 27:30.357
Where do you want it?

27:30.440 --> 27:32.359
You can put it in the med bay. Thanks.

27:32.442 --> 27:33.401
You got it.

27:37.238 --> 27:40.367
Stop. Wait.
I need to tell you what's really going on.

27:41.701 --> 27:44.412
You and I aren't going with everyone else.
We're staying here.

27:45.080 --> 27:47.624
-Family.
-We're not going with our family.

27:48.583 --> 27:51.211
Once everyone gets through,
you need to close the Rift behind them.

27:51.294 --> 27:53.880
Danger, Will Robinson.

27:54.381 --> 27:55.965
I know, but only for us.

27:56.049 --> 27:59.469
When everyone gets to Alpha Centauri,
they won't have an engine.

28:00.387 --> 28:02.764
Or me, which means they'll be safe.

28:04.349 --> 28:08.019
Then SAR will have everything he wants,
right here, waiting for him.

28:09.062 --> 28:10.063
Then you and I…

28:13.066 --> 28:13.983
together…

28:15.860 --> 28:17.654
can try to put an end to this.

29:02.031 --> 29:04.743
Hey! Hey. Hey, wake up.

29:04.826 --> 29:06.619
Are we on Alpha Centauri?

29:09.456 --> 29:11.040
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

29:11.124 --> 29:13.793
We had a chance to save our parents.
We took a vote.

29:13.877 --> 29:16.588
That's funny.
I don't remember getting a vote.

29:16.671 --> 29:19.007
I don't remember you being
a ten to 16-year-old kid,

29:19.090 --> 29:20.717
but you ended up on our Jupiter.

29:20.800 --> 29:21.718
Fair point.

29:22.594 --> 29:24.471
Look, you'll still get to the colony.

29:24.554 --> 29:26.848
-Right now, I need your help.

29:26.931 --> 29:28.683
-I woke you up.

29:29.809 --> 29:32.437
I held up my end of the deal.
Now it's your turn.

29:32.520 --> 29:33.438
Ugh.

29:46.242 --> 29:48.453
Okay, that's everyone. We're up.

29:58.171 --> 30:01.883
Do we have to sit at the kids' table,
or can we be with the grown-ups this time?

30:06.596 --> 30:07.889
Which seat's mine?

30:07.972 --> 30:11.684
-I thought you were supposed to be dead.
-I was supposed to be a lot of things.

30:11.768 --> 30:13.228
None of those worked out either.

30:13.311 --> 30:15.647
I saw your shattered helmet.

30:15.730 --> 30:17.607
I-- How did you get--

30:17.690 --> 30:20.985
She stowed away on our Jupiter.
She's been with us the whole time.

30:21.069 --> 30:23.696
I helped take care of the kids,
Maureen.

30:23.780 --> 30:26.658
It's true.
She's like a less drunk Miss Hannigan.

30:28.409 --> 30:29.452
Okay, buckle up!

30:29.536 --> 30:30.912
-We need--
-Maureen!

30:33.581 --> 30:37.544
I actually owe my survival to you.

30:38.044 --> 30:41.339
If you hadn't built this
nifty little compartment over here,

30:41.422 --> 30:43.216
I-- I never would have made it.

30:43.842 --> 30:47.971
Sure, it's a little cramped,
but as Penny can attest…

30:50.098 --> 30:52.725
I'm really good
at squeezing into tight spaces.

30:52.809 --> 30:54.185
I'm surprisingly…

30:55.353 --> 30:56.479
bendy.

30:56.563 --> 30:57.730
Penny, grab your brother.

30:57.814 --> 31:00.024
I think he's still on the Fortuna
with the robot.

31:00.108 --> 31:01.651
Get him. We're launching now.

31:06.239 --> 31:08.032
What is that?

31:15.081 --> 31:16.332
Reinforcements.

31:19.669 --> 31:21.754
No. No!

31:21.838 --> 31:24.757
The Rift is still open.
We can't let them through.

31:27.010 --> 31:28.636
<i>Audio connected.</i>

31:31.890 --> 31:34.767
-Is that sound coming from them?

32:06.799 --> 32:09.010
-Will! Are you okay?

32:09.093 --> 32:11.346
-Come on! We gotta go now! Come on!

32:14.515 --> 32:18.019
Robot, let's go.
And close the Rift when we're through.

32:21.022 --> 32:23.066
Hi. It's nice of you to join us.

32:43.336 --> 32:45.213
I think someone's crashing our party.

32:52.053 --> 32:53.137
It's SAR.

32:54.263 --> 32:57.141
John, he can't go to the colony
if we don't.

32:57.225 --> 32:58.059
Right.

32:58.643 --> 33:01.312
-Robot, send us somewhere else!
-Wait! What?

33:02.438 --> 33:03.898
<i>Anywhere else! Now!</i>

33:17.120 --> 33:19.080
-We've lost power!

33:19.163 --> 33:20.415
Hold on, everyone!

33:34.679 --> 33:35.722
Alpha Centauri.

33:37.515 --> 33:39.183
We made it!

33:40.560 --> 33:41.853
All pilots report in.

33:41.936 --> 33:44.313
As soon as you're accounted for,
head for the colony.

33:44.397 --> 33:46.274
-Hail Alpha Centauri.

33:46.858 --> 33:48.609
-Tell 'em we're coming.
-<i>Jupiter 12.</i>

33:48.693 --> 33:50.653
-<i>Jupiter 16. Ready.</i>
-<i>Jupiter 5.</i>

33:50.737 --> 33:52.238
<i>-Jupiter 33.</i>
<i>-Jupiter 9. Ready.</i>

33:52.321 --> 33:53.448
<i>Jupiter 7. We copy.</i>

33:53.531 --> 33:55.450
Sir, it-- it looks like we're one short.

33:56.868 --> 33:57.785
Who?

33:58.953 --> 33:59.954
The Jupiter 2.

34:04.417 --> 34:06.294
Where are they?

34:24.687 --> 34:26.022
I can't power cycle!

34:26.105 --> 34:29.317
All the systems are dead.
Ignition, navigation, everything.

34:29.400 --> 34:30.485
What do we do?

34:31.069 --> 34:32.904
We're gonna have to eject.

34:32.987 --> 34:34.989
You've got to be kidding!

34:36.240 --> 34:37.658
John, we'll lose the ship.

34:37.742 --> 34:40.620
We could lose more than that.
We're bailing! Now!

34:41.245 --> 34:42.789
-Okay.
-Dad!

34:43.748 --> 34:45.917
You'll all be fine.
Just remember your training.

34:46.000 --> 34:47.752
-Will, you good?
-Yeah!

34:49.629 --> 34:52.048
Okay, on my count. Three…

34:54.092 --> 34:55.468
Two…

34:56.594 --> 34:57.845
One!

35:13.361 --> 35:15.863
Okay, Judy?

35:16.906 --> 35:19.283
My ejector's jammed!

35:19.867 --> 35:20.701
Mine too.

35:28.000 --> 35:29.544
Judy!

35:29.627 --> 35:30.503
I'm here!

35:31.087 --> 35:32.630
-Judy!

35:38.719 --> 35:39.554
Mom!
