00:18.018 --> 00:18.935
[knocking on door]

00:19.019 --> 00:21.771
[Mindy] Dad, come on. Open the door.
We just wanna talk.

00:21.855 --> 00:25.316
Maybe somebody should go round the back
just in case he tries to run.

00:25.400 --> 00:26.818
-I'll go.
-Please.

00:26.901 --> 00:31.239
He's a 75-year-old man.
The only running he does is to the toilet.

00:31.322 --> 00:32.198
[Robbie] I won't go.

00:32.282 --> 00:34.034
I don't know.
He's pretty spry for his age.

00:34.117 --> 00:35.577
-I'll go.
-[Mindy] Stay!

00:35.660 --> 00:36.661
I won't go.

00:37.954 --> 00:39.205
Is everything okay?

00:40.457 --> 00:41.916
Hey, Yvette!

00:42.000 --> 00:43.043
Zdravstvuyte!

00:43.752 --> 00:44.669
Zdravstvuyte.

00:44.753 --> 00:46.004
How do you know her?

00:46.755 --> 00:48.923
Oh, no. Your dad knows her.

00:49.007 --> 00:50.842
[chuckles] I don't know her.

00:51.426 --> 00:53.470
Everything's fine. Thank you

00:53.553 --> 00:55.055
Tell Sandy I say hi.

00:55.138 --> 00:56.431
You've got it!

00:56.931 --> 00:57.974
[footsteps receding]

01:04.314 --> 01:06.900
I'm so sorry. I was in the shower.

01:06.983 --> 01:08.985
You're fucking Russian hookers now, huh?

01:10.278 --> 01:11.613
Please, come in.

01:18.661 --> 01:20.080
It's like a clown car.

01:21.498 --> 01:23.291
[theme music playing]

01:28.004 --> 01:30.924
-Judd Melman, family and estate law.
-All right.

01:31.007 --> 01:34.427
Divorce, child custody, alimony,
trusts, probates, wills, et cetera.

01:34.511 --> 01:35.345
Okay.

01:35.428 --> 01:37.138
I'm also Dianetics clear, OT VII.

01:37.222 --> 01:39.974
I'm an ethics officer
in the Church of Scientology.

01:40.058 --> 01:42.018
-How much are you paying this guy?
-Nothing.

01:42.102 --> 01:44.229
He agreed to represent us on contingency.

01:44.729 --> 01:45.939
-Twenty percent?
-Thirty.

01:46.022 --> 01:47.065
Whoa! [chuckles]

01:47.148 --> 01:50.026
Thirty. Wow.
That's… that's… that's good for you, huh?

01:51.402 --> 01:52.487
What's this?

01:52.570 --> 01:55.198
A lowball estimate
of how much you'll be giving him.

01:58.451 --> 01:59.494
Let's talk outside.

02:02.372 --> 02:04.332
That is one enturbulated thetan.

02:04.415 --> 02:05.667
Whole track engrams.

02:05.750 --> 02:06.584
[door opens]

02:08.711 --> 02:09.546
[door closes]

02:12.048 --> 02:13.925
Okay. Your turn.

02:14.801 --> 02:15.635
[sighs]

02:16.219 --> 02:18.805
I'm sorry, Dad, but Martin
is more important to me than money.

02:18.888 --> 02:20.974
He won't be if you give it a little time.

02:21.808 --> 02:23.852
What the hell-- [chuckles]
What money is this?

02:24.686 --> 02:27.272
Norman left me ten million dollars.

02:30.775 --> 02:31.693
You kidding me?

02:33.111 --> 02:35.071
Is this why you've been so mean to me?

02:35.155 --> 02:36.114
Yes.

02:37.490 --> 02:39.951
I'm sorry. He got in my head.

02:40.034 --> 02:40.869
Oh, really?

02:40.952 --> 02:43.663
-You're throwing me under the bus?
-I thought you and I were friends.

02:43.746 --> 02:46.583
We are, but come on,
that's a fuckload of money.

02:46.666 --> 02:48.126
Shame on you!

02:48.209 --> 02:50.753
No. No shame. Good father.

02:51.504 --> 02:52.881
If it will make you feel better,

02:52.964 --> 02:56.801
I will sign a prenup that prevents me
from touching that money.

02:56.885 --> 02:58.303
-Deal.
-Wait.

02:58.386 --> 03:01.764
No waiting. We all heard him.
Prenup. He gets nothing.

03:01.848 --> 03:03.641
-All right. Shut up.
-Too late.

03:04.726 --> 03:07.312
-Look. Is what's yours mine?
-Of course.

03:07.395 --> 03:08.938
-The house?
-Yes.

03:09.022 --> 03:12.317
Oh, come on. That dump is worthless.
It's… it's a knockdown.

03:12.400 --> 03:15.236
You told me the house was lovely
and had good bones.

03:15.320 --> 03:17.989
-That's just what you say.
-Oh, shame on you!

03:20.700 --> 03:22.410
Then what's mine is yours.

03:22.493 --> 03:23.620
Oh, shit.

03:25.663 --> 03:26.664
Wow.

03:26.748 --> 03:29.209
Mindy Clarice Kominsky--

03:29.292 --> 03:31.836
-[Phoebe] We fired Judd.
-But we still want our money.

03:31.920 --> 03:33.046
Not now!

03:35.548 --> 03:36.591
Go on.

03:39.344 --> 03:40.678
Will you marry me?

03:41.346 --> 03:42.180
[chuckles]

03:42.931 --> 03:43.765
I will.

03:44.349 --> 03:45.225
[both chuckle]

03:46.935 --> 03:49.646
Oy. Okay, I'm gonna come up
and kiss you in a second.

03:49.729 --> 03:51.147
-[Mindy] Okay.
-Little help here?

03:51.231 --> 03:52.899
Congratulations.

03:54.442 --> 03:55.610
Are you happy?

03:55.693 --> 03:56.611
Very.

03:59.113 --> 04:00.657
[suspenseful music playing]

04:08.623 --> 04:11.084
How's it going
with your daughter moving back in?

04:11.167 --> 04:12.210
My child.

04:12.293 --> 04:14.212
Sorry. Your child.

04:14.295 --> 04:18.007
Well, you know, it's hard work,
but I love being a grand zaza.

04:18.716 --> 04:20.718
-Being a what?
-Grand zaza.

04:20.802 --> 04:22.470
"Grandpa" is too gender-specific.

04:22.553 --> 04:24.013
-Oh, right. Sure.
-Wow.

04:24.097 --> 04:26.641
Bad news is
I'm not getting any help from Kelly.

04:26.724 --> 04:28.268
What's going on with her?

04:28.351 --> 04:29.185
Them.

04:29.769 --> 04:31.104
Sorry. Them.

04:31.771 --> 04:34.565
Yesterday was Jackie's first day
of kindergarten.

04:34.649 --> 04:37.443
Kelly insists that Ze present as andro.

04:37.527 --> 04:41.906
Jackie has a meltdown because Ze
wants to present as Buzz Lightyear.

04:41.990 --> 04:43.032
Ze is he?

04:43.116 --> 04:44.450
And she.

04:44.951 --> 04:48.955
While Kelly is
the dictionary definition of "unfluid."

04:49.038 --> 04:50.373
That's in the dictionary?

04:50.456 --> 04:53.334
So Ze tells Jackie
that Buzz is bi-gender.

04:53.418 --> 04:55.545
-Is that true?
-Course not.

04:55.628 --> 04:59.340
Buzz is totally cisgender.
Gynosexual at the very least.

04:59.424 --> 05:00.383
At the least.

05:00.466 --> 05:02.051
Here we go.

05:03.970 --> 05:05.096
[groans]

05:06.055 --> 05:06.889
Hmm.

05:07.849 --> 05:09.350
Thirty-two caliber. What do you think?

05:09.434 --> 05:12.729
[sighs] Full metal jacket,
steel core, armor-piercing.

05:12.812 --> 05:16.065
Went through that car door
like an incontinent Republican

05:16.149 --> 05:18.318
in a gender-neutral bathroom.

05:18.401 --> 05:20.486
Are we done? Should I close him up?

05:21.487 --> 05:22.780
What are you looking for?

05:23.489 --> 05:26.659
Police have the shooter and the gun.
Ballistics are sure to match.

05:26.743 --> 05:28.911
[Morgan] The footage
from the CCTV near the bridge

05:28.995 --> 05:32.206
shows our vic here
slumped over the steering wheel of his car

05:32.290 --> 05:33.916
at exactly 12:05.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.877
-[Margaret] So?
-[Morgan groans]

05:37.545 --> 05:38.880
Look at that ticker.

05:38.963 --> 05:41.507
This guy clearly had
a massive heart attack

05:41.591 --> 05:42.800
a little after 12 p.m.

05:43.384 --> 05:46.721
-Meaning…
-Meaning, how do you murder a dead man?

05:46.804 --> 05:49.015
-You're setting him free.
-No.

05:49.974 --> 05:51.642
The evidence is setting him free.

05:51.726 --> 05:54.020
[director] And cut!
All right. Let's turn it around.

05:54.103 --> 05:55.480
-[bell rings]
-Hot potato.

05:58.399 --> 06:01.027
-[chuckles] Thanks for coming.
-Hey.

06:01.110 --> 06:02.945
-Sorry.
-Great job.

06:03.029 --> 06:05.031
When I saw you here, I got so nervous.

06:05.114 --> 06:07.700
-Didn't show at all. You were terrific.
-[chuckles]

06:07.784 --> 06:09.660
Oh, Sandy, this is Morgan.

06:09.744 --> 06:12.205
Morgan, this is
my incredible acting coach,

06:12.288 --> 06:13.373
Sandy Kominsky.

06:13.456 --> 06:15.249
-So nice to meet-- Sorry.
-[both chuckle]

06:15.333 --> 06:17.960
Same here. I… I'm such a big fan.

06:18.044 --> 06:19.045
Well, thank you.

06:19.128 --> 06:21.130
I love the new twist on the character.

06:21.214 --> 06:22.757
Were you able to follow the dialogue?

06:22.840 --> 06:25.385
I wanna say yes, but, uh--

06:25.468 --> 06:26.677
No. I get it.

06:26.761 --> 06:28.930
I keep trying to tell these writers,

06:29.013 --> 06:31.849
"Don't assume the audience
is going to understand this stuff."

06:31.933 --> 06:34.894
But they--
And when I say "they," I mean "they."

06:34.977 --> 06:38.022
They insist
that's how the character would speak.

06:38.106 --> 06:38.981
Writers.

06:39.065 --> 06:40.400
Fuckin' bullies.

06:40.483 --> 06:43.403
Oh, hey, way to go
with this young lady here. [chuckles]

06:43.486 --> 06:47.448
I had very little to do with it.
They is truly talented.

06:47.532 --> 06:48.616
-[Morgan chuckles]
-Stop.

06:48.699 --> 06:50.118
Hey, if you ever have a free night,

06:50.201 --> 06:52.245
maybe you'd like to come
to one of my classes,

06:52.328 --> 06:54.163
talk about how you approach your work.

06:54.247 --> 06:55.748
Well, thank you.

06:55.832 --> 06:58.292
I just may take you up on that.

06:58.376 --> 07:01.546
You know,
I have an acting workshop on MasterClass.

07:01.629 --> 07:03.131
Oh sure. No, I've… I've heard of that.

07:03.214 --> 07:04.924
You should check out the website.

07:05.007 --> 07:09.178
Helen Mirren, Natalie Portman, Scorsese.
A lot of big people are doing it.

07:09.262 --> 07:10.555
Uh, that's cool. Yeah.

07:10.638 --> 07:13.433
I got my own website, you know.
I do the Instagram.

07:13.516 --> 07:15.309
-A little YouTube.
-Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

07:16.018 --> 07:17.353
-Morgan. Ready for you.
-Okay.

07:17.937 --> 07:19.730
Ready for your close-up, dear?

07:19.814 --> 07:21.607
-I guess.
-[Morgan] Okay.

07:21.691 --> 07:23.359
-Very nice to meet you.
-Likewise.

07:24.318 --> 07:25.153
Bye.

07:28.156 --> 07:30.241
[exhales] "A little YouTube"?

07:30.741 --> 07:34.579
Good, Sandy, that's great.
That's just… fucking great.

07:43.254 --> 07:44.297
[laughs]

07:45.423 --> 07:47.508
I love it that you still come here.

07:47.592 --> 07:49.635
When something is good, you stick with it.

07:50.303 --> 07:51.679
That's a little insulting.

07:52.597 --> 07:53.931
Hey. You divorced me.

07:54.515 --> 07:56.809
Oh yeah, because you weren't good.

07:57.310 --> 07:59.187
Oh well. I stand corrected.

07:59.770 --> 08:01.022
-Moving on.
-Okay.

08:01.105 --> 08:03.566
-How do we do this wedding?
-Oh, easy.

08:03.649 --> 08:07.111
I'll plan everything with Mindy,
and then we hand you the bills.

08:07.195 --> 08:08.529
And by "everything" you mean…

08:08.613 --> 08:13.367
The menu, food, the band,
the flowers, the invites,

08:13.451 --> 08:15.495
the wedding dress, the rehearsal dinner.

08:16.579 --> 08:22.460
Oh, don't worry. Maybe Mindy
will want to keep it small and intimate.

08:22.543 --> 08:25.421
Maybe we can encourage that.

08:25.505 --> 08:26.339
Ah.

08:26.881 --> 08:29.425
[inhales] What do we know
about Martin's parents?

08:30.009 --> 08:32.220
Not much. His, uh… his dad passed.

08:32.303 --> 08:36.516
His mom's in one of those,
uh, senior citizen ghettos in Scottsdale.

08:36.599 --> 08:39.894
Oh! God's waiting room. Are they close?

08:39.977 --> 08:41.437
I don't think so.

08:41.521 --> 08:43.814
Every time I ask about her, he, uh--

08:44.524 --> 08:46.943
He flinches a little bit,
then he changes the subject.

08:47.026 --> 08:49.779
-You're kidding.
-No. Try-- Try it. You'll see.

08:49.862 --> 08:51.239
He actually goes…

08:51.739 --> 08:53.199
[both laugh]

08:53.950 --> 08:57.161
Oh, God! Mommy issues.
Oh, that's not a good sign.

08:57.245 --> 08:59.539
That's what you always said
was my problem.

08:59.622 --> 09:00.957
Well, tell me.

09:01.624 --> 09:04.126
Why is it that, in your long life…

09:04.210 --> 09:08.714
[inhales deeply] …you have utterly failed
to form a lasting relationship

09:09.340 --> 09:10.466
with any one woman?

09:11.175 --> 09:12.635
I didn't say you were wrong.

09:12.718 --> 09:14.554
[both chuckle]

09:19.475 --> 09:22.645
[inhales] I know it doesn't mean much
at this point, uh…

09:23.396 --> 09:24.230
[inhales]

09:24.313 --> 09:26.732
…but I'm sorry I was not a better husband.

09:29.485 --> 09:31.362
That means a lot. [chuckles]

09:31.445 --> 09:32.446
Thank you.

09:32.530 --> 09:33.364
[inhales]

09:37.118 --> 09:37.952
Tell me.

09:38.494 --> 09:39.328
[clears throat]

09:39.412 --> 09:41.247
How come you never remarried?

09:42.164 --> 09:43.624
Oh, you really want to know?

09:45.835 --> 09:47.837
Well, Sandy, sweetheart,

09:48.796 --> 09:51.173
I never fell out of love with you.

09:52.967 --> 09:54.010
Really?

09:54.802 --> 09:57.221
-No. I'm fucking with you.
-[scoffs, laughs]

09:57.305 --> 09:58.931
I was too busy with the work.

09:59.015 --> 10:00.933
-Why would you do that?
-I'm sorry.

10:01.017 --> 10:03.477
-You're not sorry. Yeah, right.
-No, I'm not sorry.

10:04.061 --> 10:06.897
-Here's to fucking with me.
-Here's to fucking with you.

10:11.068 --> 10:13.029
Tell me the truth
about the Russian hooker.

10:13.613 --> 10:14.614
[groans]

10:22.955 --> 10:24.332
Oh, shit.

10:27.043 --> 10:28.544
-Surprise!
-[Robbie] How do?

10:28.628 --> 10:30.671
[Phoebe chuckles]

10:30.755 --> 10:31.589
Now what?

10:31.672 --> 10:34.967
Oh, we were both really upset
about how we handled things,

10:35.051 --> 10:36.385
and we wanted to apologize.

10:36.469 --> 10:38.638
On the emotional tone scale,
we are below grief,

10:38.721 --> 10:41.349
somewhere between self-abasement
and making amends.

10:41.432 --> 10:44.477
Uh-huh, and I see the Greeks
have come bearing gifts, huh?

10:45.311 --> 10:46.520
I don't know what that means,

10:46.604 --> 10:49.565
but this is a cashmere hoodie
from Brunello Cucinelli.

10:49.649 --> 10:50.816
And this is an assortment

10:50.900 --> 10:53.069
of fine wines and cheeses
from Larry's Liquor Locker.

10:53.152 --> 10:54.028
Uh-huh.

10:55.112 --> 10:56.697
Can we just talk for a minute?

10:56.781 --> 10:58.324
Do I have a choice?

10:58.407 --> 10:59.492
[Phoebe] We want you to know

10:59.575 --> 11:02.078
how sorry we are
for siccing our lawyer on you.

11:02.161 --> 11:03.871
That was totally uncalled-for,

11:03.954 --> 11:06.207
and I have initiated
a third-party investigation

11:06.290 --> 11:09.210
to find out whether
a suppressive person caused the entheta.

11:11.879 --> 11:13.422
What is wrong with you?

11:14.131 --> 11:15.257
I'm gonna find out.

11:16.175 --> 11:17.635
Is that it? Are we done?

11:17.718 --> 11:18.552
Not quite.

11:19.845 --> 11:22.848
Based on your lowball number
and our own inquiries--

11:22.932 --> 11:25.976
-Google.
-[sighs] We guesstimate Dad's estate--

11:26.060 --> 11:27.978
Cash, stocks, bonds, properties,

11:28.062 --> 11:29.939
controlling interest
in the Newlander Agency.

11:30.022 --> 11:31.816
To be worth about $100 million.

11:31.899 --> 11:33.067
[Robbie] Again, a guesstimate.

11:33.150 --> 11:35.695
And we think it wouldn't be
the worst thing in the world

11:35.778 --> 11:37.988
for some part of that
to be distributed now.

11:38.072 --> 11:41.158
Yeah. Bank wire, Venmo, PayPal. Your call.

11:42.118 --> 11:44.995
Okay, first of all,
the estate is not worth 100 million.

11:45.663 --> 11:47.623
-It's not?
-Closer to 150.

11:47.707 --> 11:48.666
[coughs]

11:49.875 --> 11:52.878
-Is… is that a guesstimate?
-No.

11:52.962 --> 11:56.298
And once again, I have been instructed
to give it all to charity

11:56.382 --> 12:01.095
if, in my judgment, neither of you
seem to be mature enough to inherit.

12:01.178 --> 12:03.848
-Which way do you think it's leaning?
-At the moment?

12:04.807 --> 12:06.183
[smacks lips] Mmm…

12:06.267 --> 12:11.188
American Cancer Society, Red Cross,
uh, maybe, uh, Jews for Jesus, you know.

12:11.272 --> 12:12.481
This is good cheese.

12:12.565 --> 12:14.900
Sandy,
I'm just gonna throw this out there,

12:14.984 --> 12:17.069
and this is just for the sake of argument,

12:17.153 --> 12:21.031
but given your advanced age,
what happens to--

12:21.115 --> 12:21.991
Careful.

12:25.786 --> 12:27.705
-Never mind.
-That's a good call.

12:28.789 --> 12:30.916
Okay, Mom. I… I think we're done here.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.461
-Thank you so much for your time.
-Sure.

12:33.544 --> 12:35.796
I… I hope you know,

12:35.880 --> 12:41.135
despite all this back and forth
about money, that I love you very much.

12:42.845 --> 12:45.181
-Good night, Phoebe.
-Good night, Sandy.

12:49.393 --> 12:50.227
Sandy.

12:51.479 --> 12:54.857
I… also love you very much.

13:01.155 --> 13:02.031
[door closes]

13:06.786 --> 13:08.996
I hope you're enjoying this.

13:11.040 --> 13:13.375
[Darshani] Oh, my God, you're right!
Every time I see them,

13:13.459 --> 13:16.837
no matter what character they're playing,
I think I'm losing my hearing.

13:16.921 --> 13:19.757
Christian Bale,
Matthew McConaughey, and Tom Hardy.

13:19.840 --> 13:22.009
They're like the holy trinity
of movie mumblers.

13:22.092 --> 13:25.221
Mm-hmm. The father, the son,
and the "what the fuck did he just say?"

13:25.304 --> 13:26.138
[all laugh]

13:26.222 --> 13:29.433
If you're Marlon Brando, you can mumble,
but everybody else has to speak up.

13:29.517 --> 13:32.853
Yeah. You know who's also a big mumbler?
Paul Giamatti.

13:32.937 --> 13:36.774
No. He's a whisperer. Watch Billions.
Every scene.

13:36.857 --> 13:39.318
[whispering] "This time,
Axe Capital is going down."

13:39.401 --> 13:41.654
-[others chuckle]
-"Bobby Axelrod is history."

13:41.737 --> 13:44.365
A couple years ago, I met him
at a dry cleaner's on Cahuenga.

13:44.448 --> 13:46.617
He was very chilly to me.

13:46.700 --> 13:49.078
I… I liked him in Sideways.

13:49.161 --> 13:50.037
[silence]

13:51.705 --> 13:52.540
So?

13:54.542 --> 13:55.876
So, he was funny.

13:57.211 --> 13:59.421
-Eddie Redmayne.
-Un-fucking-intelligible.

14:00.297 --> 14:01.632
[all] Hey, Sandy.

14:01.715 --> 14:03.008
-[Sandy] Hey.
-[door shuts]

14:03.092 --> 14:05.052
Oh, I'm glad you're all here.

14:05.678 --> 14:06.804
We need to talk.

14:06.887 --> 14:09.139
-Just make sure you enunciate.
-[others laugh]

14:09.223 --> 14:10.850
-What?
-Nothing.

14:10.933 --> 14:12.059
Sorry. Go on.

14:12.977 --> 14:15.729
I didn't think, uh,
that this needed to be said,

14:16.230 --> 14:17.857
but apparently, it does.

14:17.940 --> 14:18.858
[clears throat]

14:19.525 --> 14:23.195
What we do and what I teach
is an art form.

14:23.279 --> 14:24.697
It's not a competition.

14:25.656 --> 14:28.367
[inhales] It's a, uh… a group effort.

14:29.076 --> 14:33.038
A communal expression
of what it means to be human.

14:33.706 --> 14:34.623
So… [exhales]

14:34.707 --> 14:37.126
…you know, when one of us falls,
we pick them up.

14:37.918 --> 14:41.380
And when one of us achieves
fame and fortune,

14:42.006 --> 14:46.760
whether it be through lucky breaks
or plain old hard work or both,

14:47.511 --> 14:50.306
we put aside jealousy and envy

14:50.931 --> 14:53.767
and joyfully celebrate their success.

14:53.851 --> 14:55.561
And in so doing,

14:55.644 --> 15:00.858
we open up our hearts and create a channel
for success to come to us.

15:01.609 --> 15:02.484
Understood?

15:02.985 --> 15:05.362
-[Breana] Mm-hmm.
-Good. Okay. See you in a few.

15:09.783 --> 15:11.368
I so disagree with that.

15:11.452 --> 15:13.579
Yeah. That is some serious bullshit.

15:13.662 --> 15:16.332
-What the hell was that?
-Some hippie-dippie bullshit.

15:16.415 --> 15:17.541
No, no. No way.

15:18.125 --> 15:19.585
Ooh, yeah.

15:20.461 --> 15:22.838
And how are my wedding planners?

15:22.922 --> 15:24.381
Oh, pretty good.

15:24.882 --> 15:30.304
Hey.
We're thinking June in Tahiti or Fiji,

15:30.387 --> 15:32.097
Bora-Bora.

15:32.181 --> 15:33.682
[chuckling] That's very funny.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.226
It's not a joke, Dad.

15:36.310 --> 15:37.561
Yeah, right.

15:38.228 --> 15:39.104
It's not.

15:40.856 --> 15:42.608
-It's not?
-Uh-uh.

15:43.609 --> 15:46.570
I know it's expensive, so if you'd rather,
Martin and I can pay for it

15:46.654 --> 15:48.072
out of my inheritance from Norman.

15:48.155 --> 15:50.324
No, no. Don't touch that.
That's your nest egg.

15:50.407 --> 15:52.242
Well, then how do we do this?

15:52.326 --> 15:54.787
I… I… I still wanna pay. It's just, uh,

15:54.870 --> 15:57.998
I wasn't thinking
an exotic destination wedding.

15:58.582 --> 15:59.792
What were you thinking?

16:00.376 --> 16:01.627
I don't know. [sighs]

16:01.710 --> 16:03.629
The Sportsmen's Lodge in the Valley?

16:05.756 --> 16:06.674
Oh, honey.

16:08.008 --> 16:08.926
I'm sorry.

16:09.468 --> 16:12.096
It's okay.
I had a feeling this would happen.

16:12.179 --> 16:14.473
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait.
Now… now… now wait.

16:14.556 --> 16:18.268
Maybe there's some middle ground
that's, uh, more affordable.

16:18.352 --> 16:20.479
-Hawaii.
-Middle-er.

16:20.562 --> 16:21.397
Cabo?

16:21.480 --> 16:23.691
-Keep coming.
-Just say it.

16:24.733 --> 16:26.986
The Valley can be very beautiful
in the spring.

16:28.070 --> 16:28.988
[exhales deeply]

16:29.863 --> 16:31.699
Know what? Never mind.

16:31.782 --> 16:34.368
We'll have a little party
in Martin's backyard,

16:34.451 --> 16:35.911
invite a few friends.

16:36.829 --> 16:37.830
It'll be fine.

16:37.913 --> 16:40.332
No! Oh no, baby. No, no.

16:40.416 --> 16:43.669
We will figure something out.
We're gonna make it a special day for you.

16:43.752 --> 16:46.255
Right? Come on. Help me out.

16:47.256 --> 16:48.173
I can't.

16:49.174 --> 16:52.845
-Why not?
-Because I'm still fucking with you.

16:52.928 --> 16:54.513
-[snorts]
-[both laugh]

16:54.596 --> 16:55.556
What?

16:55.639 --> 16:57.266
Oh, if you could see your face.

16:57.891 --> 16:58.726
Middle-er?

16:59.601 --> 17:01.645
You little rat fuckers, you know.

17:01.729 --> 17:04.815
Oh, the Valley is so beautiful.

17:04.898 --> 17:07.109
-In the spring.
-[Sandy] Okay. All right.

17:07.192 --> 17:10.821
-That's enough. Very funny.
-I thought I was gonna pee myself.

17:10.904 --> 17:13.032
-[both laughing]
-Very good. Okay.

17:13.115 --> 17:15.325
[laughing continues]

17:15.409 --> 17:16.493
So where's Martin?

17:16.577 --> 17:17.619
[laughing stops]

17:19.121 --> 17:20.080
He's, uh…

17:20.873 --> 17:23.500
-He's taking a break.
-But what does that mean?

17:24.585 --> 17:28.714
It means he doesn't want
to be in your class anymore.

17:29.548 --> 17:30.382
Why?

17:30.466 --> 17:32.384
Seriously, you don't know?

17:33.218 --> 17:35.888
[sighs] You really hurt his feelings
about the money.

17:36.680 --> 17:39.558
Oh, please, he has to know
that I was trying to protect you.

17:39.641 --> 17:44.480
Sandy, you looked him right in the eye
and told him you didn't trust him.

17:45.105 --> 17:47.775
Yeah, but, yeah, I was just trying
to pro… protect her.

17:48.358 --> 17:50.903
[sighs] Maybe you should go over later
and talk to him.

17:50.986 --> 17:54.406
-You want me to go over and apologize?
-Yes.

17:56.992 --> 17:57.826
Well?

17:59.119 --> 18:01.163
Are you sure that you're gonna marry him?

18:01.830 --> 18:02.748
I am.

18:03.749 --> 18:06.043
Okay, well,
then I guess my hands are tied.

18:06.126 --> 18:07.836
You used to like that.

18:08.670 --> 18:09.755
Mom.

18:10.297 --> 18:11.131
[Roz] He did.

18:11.215 --> 18:13.050
-Ugh.
-[both chuckle]

18:16.470 --> 18:17.471
[phone rings]

18:18.764 --> 18:19.723
Yello.

18:19.807 --> 18:21.892
Sandy, Robbie Newlander here.

18:21.975 --> 18:23.685
What can I do for you, Robbie?

18:23.769 --> 18:25.896
Nothing. Just called to say hi.

18:25.979 --> 18:27.022
Hi.

18:27.106 --> 18:29.399
-Are you having a nice day?
-[Sandy] Robbie, come on.

18:29.900 --> 18:32.486
Okay. I have an idea for a new business.

18:32.569 --> 18:34.571
I need a little seed money
to get it up and running.

18:35.155 --> 18:37.366
Uh-huh, and what is this business?

18:37.449 --> 18:39.326
It's a slam dunk is what it is.

18:39.409 --> 18:41.161
I can't believe
nobody thought of this before.

18:41.245 --> 18:42.287
Just tell me, Robbie.

18:42.371 --> 18:44.832
Okay. So, you get
how we've all lived multiple lives

18:44.915 --> 18:46.125
going back billions of years.

18:46.208 --> 18:47.751
Sure. I get that.

18:47.835 --> 18:50.796
So, what I wanna do
is create an online community

18:50.879 --> 18:53.173
where people can share
their past-life memories.

18:53.257 --> 18:54.091
[Sandy] Okay.

18:54.174 --> 18:56.718
We could have a monthly magazine
with cover stories like,

18:56.802 --> 18:58.095
"Robert Downey Jr."

18:58.178 --> 19:00.347
-"Why Does He Look So Familiar?"
-[Sandy] Right.

19:00.430 --> 19:03.892
And a chain of theme restaurants
that take a playful look

19:03.976 --> 19:06.186
at our various incarnations
throughout the millennia.

19:06.270 --> 19:09.773
Waiters dressed like Nazis
or plantation owners, that sort of thing.

19:09.857 --> 19:13.026
So, like the worst of mankind
and buffalo wings.

19:13.110 --> 19:14.111
Exactly.

19:14.194 --> 19:16.196
And how much seed money
are we talking about?

19:16.280 --> 19:18.657
-Let me tell you the name I came up with.
-[phone beeps]

19:18.740 --> 19:20.617
Wait, hold on.
I got another call coming in here.

19:21.201 --> 19:22.035
Hello.

19:22.119 --> 19:24.121
Sandy, hey, it's Morgan Freeman.

19:24.621 --> 19:26.915
Hey, Morgan! Hey, what's up?

19:26.999 --> 19:30.002
Is it cool to come by Friday night?
Talk to your class?

19:30.085 --> 19:32.045
Yes! Absolutely. Thanks.

19:32.129 --> 19:35.132
Are you working on anything
that I might be able to help with?

19:35.215 --> 19:38.385
Uh, maybe you could encourage the kids
to be more supportive of each other.

19:38.468 --> 19:40.846
You know,
talk about how acting is a team sport.

19:40.929 --> 19:43.807
[chuckles] Right.
You came up in New York, didn't you?

19:43.891 --> 19:44.808
Yeah.

19:44.892 --> 19:46.768
I… I… I thought so.

19:46.852 --> 19:49.563
Well, no worries,
I can sell that bullshit all day long.

19:49.646 --> 19:51.607
I gotta go now, Sandy. Bye.

19:52.107 --> 19:52.983
-[phone beeps]
-[sighs]

19:53.066 --> 19:55.027
Uh, sorry, Robbie. Go ahead.

19:55.110 --> 19:57.070
It's called Samsara's Club. [chuckles]

19:57.154 --> 19:58.280
Uh, what is?

19:58.363 --> 20:01.283
The social media platforms, the magazine,
the restaurants.

20:01.366 --> 20:04.369
Samsara is the Buddhist word
for the eternal suffering caused

20:04.453 --> 20:06.371
by the cycle of birth and death.

20:06.455 --> 20:07.289
Cute, huh?

20:07.789 --> 20:10.792
It's a play on Sam's Club.
Samsara's Club. [chuckles]

20:10.876 --> 20:13.837
That is very, very cute.
And the seed money?

20:13.921 --> 20:15.923
Twenty-five million dollars.

20:16.006 --> 20:17.424
Go big or go home, right?

20:17.507 --> 20:18.717
Go home, Robbie.

20:18.800 --> 20:19.635
[phone beeps]

20:28.852 --> 20:29.728
[groans]

20:33.523 --> 20:34.399
[sighs]

20:35.234 --> 20:36.401
[knocking]

20:38.528 --> 20:40.072
[Mindy] Thanks for doing this.

20:46.078 --> 20:47.913
-Where is he?
-In his shoe room.

20:48.830 --> 20:50.832
-Showroom?
-His shoe room.

20:50.916 --> 20:52.501
He makes his own shoes.

20:53.710 --> 20:55.087
Are you still fucking with me?

20:55.170 --> 20:57.130
No. It's his hobby.

20:57.839 --> 20:59.841
My future son-in-law is a cobbler?

21:00.550 --> 21:02.970
My second stepmother was a junkie
and a porn star.

21:03.053 --> 21:04.680
Methadone and soft-core.

21:04.763 --> 21:05.639
[grunts]

21:05.722 --> 21:06.556
Which way?

21:09.476 --> 21:10.310
[exhales deeply]

21:13.855 --> 21:14.690
[banging lightly]

21:20.153 --> 21:20.988
Hey.

21:22.406 --> 21:24.491
-Hey.
-["Man on the Corner" by Genesis playing]

21:24.574 --> 21:26.702
Oh, I didn't know you made your own shoes.

21:26.785 --> 21:30.122
Yeah, well, there's a lot
you don't know about me, Sandy.

21:31.164 --> 21:32.666
I… I guess so, but…

21:33.208 --> 21:35.502
[sniffs] …what got you into this?

21:35.585 --> 21:39.715
Well, a lot of your name-brand shoes
are made in Southeast Asia

21:39.798 --> 21:41.300
using child labor.

21:41.383 --> 21:43.218
-I didn't know that.
-Mm-hmm.

21:44.219 --> 21:46.346
So you got young blood on your feet.

21:48.098 --> 21:49.766
Well, that… that's not cool.

21:51.977 --> 21:53.645
[exhales] So, listen, um,

21:54.938 --> 21:56.523
I want to apologize.

21:56.606 --> 21:59.109
I know you're a good and trustworthy man.

21:59.192 --> 22:02.362
And I should never have implied otherwise.

22:03.989 --> 22:07.701
Listen. I loved Mindy
when she didn't have a pot to piss in.

22:07.784 --> 22:09.828
-And I love her now.
-I know that.

22:09.911 --> 22:13.582
You know, I… I… I didn't work
as a public school teacher for 38 years

22:13.665 --> 22:15.751
'cause I… I… I cared about money.

22:15.834 --> 22:17.502
I know that too.

22:17.586 --> 22:20.756
You have been an honorable man
in an honorable profession.

22:20.839 --> 22:23.133
All I ever cared about
was improving the lives of children.

22:23.216 --> 22:25.093
They don't make 'em like you anymore.

22:25.969 --> 22:29.222
And just so you know,
I've instructed Norman's trust…

22:29.306 --> 22:30.140
[inhales deeply]

22:30.640 --> 22:34.019
…to wire the money
into you and Mindy's joint account.

22:35.687 --> 22:36.563
I…

22:36.646 --> 22:38.065
Fine. Whatever.

22:38.148 --> 22:40.609
It's not gonna change my life
one way or the other.

22:42.569 --> 22:45.447
Well, I… I ju… I just hope
we can be friends again.

22:46.156 --> 22:47.908
Well, I hope so too, Sandy.

22:48.658 --> 22:50.369
You're gonna come back to class?

22:51.745 --> 22:53.747
I don't-- Sure.

22:54.998 --> 22:55.832
Good.

22:56.375 --> 22:58.710
[sighs] Okay, well, I'll, uh…

22:58.794 --> 23:00.462
I'll… I'll leave you to it, hmm?
