16:52.680 --> 16:54.520
Oh, my gosh, look at the time.

16:54.520 --> 16:56.720
I'm starving.

16:57.200 --> 16:59.720
- Have we had dinner yet? 
 - [ Man Chattering On TV ]

16:59.720 --> 17:01.160
Good to hear 
 your voice again, Dad.

17:01.600 --> 17:03.560
[ Seth Whispering ] 
 Let's go.

17:05.920 --> 17:07.400
It worked.

17:07.400 --> 17:09.920
Man, that was close. 
 Could we get rid of this thing now?

17:09.920 --> 17:12.400
- But I fixed it. 
 - Seth.

17:13.920 --> 17:16.400
[ Sighs ] 
 All right.

17:21.839 --> 17:23.359
Put it right in the bottom.

17:24.359 --> 17:27.359
- There. 
 - What time do they pick up the trash?

17:27.359 --> 17:28.359
Not soon enough for me.

17:28.840 --> 17:30.840
- Yeah. See you tomorrow. 
 - See you.

17:32.840 --> 17:34.480
[ Dog Barking ]

17:35.480 --> 17:38.480
[ Chuckling ] 
 What am I, crazy?

17:41.960 --> 17:44.240
[ Whistling ]

17:52.240 --> 17:53.760
Come to papa.

17:54.760 --> 17:56.160
[ Laughing ]

18:02.600 --> 18:04.120
[ Students Chattering ]

18:11.800 --> 18:12.880
[ Exhales ]

18:13.400 --> 18:14.840
Oh! Hi, Kev.

18:14.840 --> 18:16.880
I thought we threw 
 that thing away last night.

18:16.880 --> 18:19.120
- We did. 
 - Then what are you doing with it?

18:19.120 --> 18:21.280
Well, I-- I tried to get rid of it

18:21.680 --> 18:23.880
but it kept on magically 
 appearing in my room.

18:23.880 --> 18:27.800
You're lying, Seth. 
 And not very well.

18:27.800 --> 18:28.960
So what if I am? 
 Leave me alone.

18:29.400 --> 18:31.600
Seth, you've got to 
 get rid of that thing.

18:31.600 --> 18:32.480
It's changed you.

18:32.920 --> 18:33.960
You're right it's changed me.

18:34.360 --> 18:36.880
- I'm not a wimp any more. 
 - But it's dangerous.

18:36.880 --> 18:39.800
You almost turned your family 
 into a permanent still life.

18:39.800 --> 18:41.160
I know why you're mad.

18:41.160 --> 18:43.400
'Cause you didn't get 
 to the garbage can first.

18:43.400 --> 18:45.240
Maybe you did. 
 But you weren't quick enough.

18:45.240 --> 18:46.760
Seth, you're being a jerk.

18:46.760 --> 18:48.600
- Now give me the remote. 
 - No.

18:50.040 --> 18:51.960
- [ Kevin ] Give it to me. 
 - You can't have it.

18:51.960 --> 18:53.360
[ Grunts ]

18:54.480 --> 18:55.760
Seth...

18:57.560 --> 18:59.800
Try that again 
 and you'll really be sorry,

18:59.800 --> 19:01.240
friend.

19:15.160 --> 19:17.280
[ Phone Ringing ]

19:24.560 --> 19:26.560
[ Tony ] 
 You've misused your gift,

19:26.560 --> 19:29.040
even after repeated warnings.

19:29.040 --> 19:31.000
This is your last chance.

19:31.000 --> 19:36.000
Remember, 
 the consequences are severe.

19:36.000 --> 19:39.040
- Quit buggin' me. 
 - Give me the remote.

19:39.760 --> 19:40.510
No!

19:41.880 --> 19:43.360
[ Panting ]

19:45.760 --> 19:48.720
- Give me the remote, Seth. 
 - Back off.

19:48.720 --> 19:51.200
Kevin, back off.

19:52.640 --> 19:54.160
Give it to me!

19:56.080 --> 19:57.880
Back off, Kevin.

19:59.640 --> 20:01.800
Seth, don't do it!

20:09.960 --> 20:11.480
Hello?

20:14.360 --> 20:15.280
Hello?

Hello!

[ Remote Control Beeping ]

Oh, no. "Battery low."

it will bring you 
 a lifetime of enjoyment.

All I need are some batteries!
