WEBVTT

00:04.004 --> 00:06.297
<i>Hooch, let's tell them
what happened last week.</i>

00:06.381 --> 00:08.758
How's my favorite prosecutor?
How's Boston?

00:08.842 --> 00:10.844
Per the song,
I left my heart in San Francisco.

00:11.845 --> 00:13.638
- I gotta run. Miss you.
- Miss you.

00:13.722 --> 00:17.058
Erica, I took you for granted,
and I really apologize.

00:17.142 --> 00:19.936
I was hoping that I could pick up
Hooch's training again.

00:20.020 --> 00:21.938
- Friends again?
-<i>Friends.</i>

00:22.022 --> 00:25.150
Your dad was always riled
about developers ruining the town.

00:25.233 --> 00:27.277
- He called me wanting to meet.
- About what?

00:27.360 --> 00:29.487
He died before I had
the chance to talk with him.

00:29.571 --> 00:32.699
You know how I said I'd ask around about
that road where Dad had his heart attack?

00:32.782 --> 00:35.744
<i>Turns out, there's this warehouse out
there owned by some trucking company.</i>

00:35.827 --> 00:38.496
- Mr. Hollis, I'm so sorry.
- Please. Call me Walton.

00:38.580 --> 00:42.917
Your father, I met him a couple times.
Good guy. Sorry to hear he passed.

00:43.001 --> 00:45.336
Look me in the eyes right now
and tell me that you believe

00:45.420 --> 00:48.882
<i>that man that Hooch just freaked out at
was a friend of Dad.</i>

00:48.965 --> 00:50.258
We have no evidence, Laura.

00:50.341 --> 00:52.385
Hooch is all the evidence I need.
Let's go.

00:58.141 --> 01:00.894
So, this is how this is gonna work.

01:00.977 --> 01:04.147
When you want Hooch to attack,
you're gonna say "<i>packen</i>."

01:04.230 --> 01:06.066
<i>Packen.</i>

01:06.149 --> 01:08.651
That's his cue to run in
and bite the target.

01:08.735 --> 01:10.445
And when you wanna release,
you say "<i>platz</i>."

01:10.528 --> 01:12.447
Why are all the attack commands in German?

01:12.530 --> 01:16.242
Well, mostly
because they started in Germany,

01:16.326 --> 01:19.370
but we keep them German because we don't
want anyone to say them by accident.

01:19.454 --> 01:20.872
Hooch speaks German now, huh?

01:20.955 --> 01:23.625
Good job, buddy.
I can barely remember high school Spanish.

01:23.708 --> 01:25.168
<i>¿Dónde está la casa de Pepe?</i>

01:25.251 --> 01:27.170
That's all I know. Four years.

01:29.339 --> 01:30.882
Uh, so you think he's ready?

01:31.633 --> 01:33.218
Yeah, I mean,
I think he knows the commands.

01:33.301 --> 01:35.678
It's just about trying him in the field.

01:35.762 --> 01:36.679
- All right.
- Okay.

01:39.390 --> 01:42.685
All right, Hooch. Come on. You're a lean,
mean, biting machine. <i>Packen</i>!

01:43.186 --> 01:44.395
Yes!
Come on, Hooch!

01:44.479 --> 01:46.856
I believe in you! I believe in you!

01:46.940 --> 01:48.983
See? Go, Hooch!

01:49.067 --> 01:51.569
Come on, Hooch! No. Hooch, no.

01:51.653 --> 01:53.613
Come on. Bite him. Bite.

01:54.155 --> 01:55.573
- Yeah.

01:56.366 --> 01:57.700
I'll do it in a German accent.

01:57.784 --> 01:59.452
<i>Packen. Packen.</i>

01:59.536 --> 02:00.620
Do high-pitched.

02:00.703 --> 02:01.704
<i>Packen!</i>

02:02.330 --> 02:03.748
All right, buddy. Head in the game.

02:03.832 --> 02:06.042
<i>Packen</i>! Make him pay, Hooch! Make him pay!

02:06.126 --> 02:08.336
More <i>packen</i>-ing.

02:08.419 --> 02:11.256
He thinks it's "fetch."
It's not a stick, it's a gun.

02:11.339 --> 02:12.423
I don't know how...

02:12.507 --> 02:13.925
- I'll take it. Yeah.
- Yeah?

02:14.008 --> 02:15.760
You're doing so good. See that target?

02:15.844 --> 02:17.095
Ready, Hooch? <i>Packen</i>!

02:17.887 --> 02:19.889
- Looking good. He's doing it!
- Yes! Get him!

02:22.684 --> 02:23.810
Get him!

02:23.893 --> 02:26.396
I think he's, uh... He's cuddling.

02:27.397 --> 02:29.858
- That's a cuddle.
- Yeah, that's for sure a cuddle.

02:30.984 --> 02:32.318
Thanks, Curtis.

02:32.402 --> 02:35.655
Technically, he did immobilize Tony.

02:35.738 --> 02:38.616
Yeah. I'm set, as long as I only go
after criminals who like to spoon.

02:39.826 --> 02:43.079
The thing with attack training is,
we are tapping into the dog's instinct.

02:43.163 --> 02:45.874
Hooch gets mad at people
who threaten someone he cares about.

02:46.833 --> 02:50.253
But in his heart, I think Hooch is just
more of a lover than a biter.

02:50.837 --> 02:53.882
You gotta be patient.
It's worth it if someone's really special.

02:55.425 --> 02:59.053
And by someone, I mean, some dogs.
Hooch is a dog.

02:59.679 --> 03:02.849
I'm a trainer.
I train dogs, obviously. Never mind.

03:50.563 --> 03:52.482
<i>This is Brooke. Leave a message</i>.

03:53.900 --> 03:57.362
Hey, Brooke.
Keep getting your voice mail. It's me.

03:57.445 --> 04:00.949
I'm just headed to my sister's.
I was hoping to finally catch ya.

04:01.658 --> 04:06.204
Tag, you're "it." Still.
Call me back or you'll be "it" forever.

04:06.287 --> 04:10.458
Nobody likes to be "it." Except for me
'cause I chase people for a living.

04:11.167 --> 04:12.585
Arrrgh!

04:13.169 --> 04:15.713
I don't know why
I just made a pirate sound.

04:15.797 --> 04:18.007
Okay, call me.

04:18.091 --> 04:21.386
<i>If you're satisfied
with your message, press or say "one."</i>

04:21.469 --> 04:23.930
-<i>To rerecord, press or say "two."</i>
- Thank God. Two.

04:24.013 --> 04:26.182
-<i>Message complete. Goodbye.</i>

04:26.266 --> 04:31.020
That wasn't a "one." Thank you, Hooch.
Always have my back.

04:34.107 --> 04:36.359
Hey! The door was open.

04:36.442 --> 04:37.443
Hey, Uncle Scott!

04:37.527 --> 04:40.238
I made up a new game
called Make Blob Move!

04:40.321 --> 04:42.073
- You and Hooch can play too.
- Okay.

04:42.156 --> 04:45.076
Sorry, bud. Uncle Scott and Mommy need
to talk about grown-up stuff.

04:45.159 --> 04:47.996
Is it the puberty talk? I got it too.

04:48.079 --> 04:51.749
Uncle Scott, your body's gonna go
through some really gross changes.

04:51.833 --> 04:54.877
And your voice will sound like this.

04:54.961 --> 04:56.921
See ya!
- Good luck, Blob.

04:57.005 --> 04:58.089
Come on, Hooch.

05:00.174 --> 05:01.426
Yo!

05:01.509 --> 05:05.763
Hey. So, I've been doing some thinking
about Walton and the warehouse.

05:05.847 --> 05:07.640
And I would like to present...

05:09.934 --> 05:12.061
- Wow!
-...my case board.

05:12.145 --> 05:14.605
- I feel like I'm at the science fair.
- Yeah.

05:14.689 --> 05:16.399
- That's a lotta yarn.
- I know.

05:16.482 --> 05:19.694
- Are those devil horns?
- Yeah, 'cause he's the bad guy.

05:19.777 --> 05:22.238
So, I put on all the criminals
that were in Dad's case box,

05:22.322 --> 05:24.032
plus the stuff
from his files at the station.

05:24.115 --> 05:26.993
And I thought, you know,
you could do your marshal magic

05:27.076 --> 05:28.911
and see if I was missing anything.

05:29.871 --> 05:31.998
I appreciate the work, Laura.

05:32.081 --> 05:35.126
And it's got a very fun
sort of dream catcher vibe.

05:35.209 --> 05:36.210
It totally does.

05:36.294 --> 05:38.838
But this is the stuff people do in movies.

05:38.921 --> 05:41.841
Like, if I needed to do a link analysis,
I would just use a computer.

05:41.924 --> 05:43.051
Look, look.

05:43.134 --> 05:46.554
Green yarn's for the clues that Dad found,
and yellow's for the clues that we found,

05:46.637 --> 05:48.389
and then, well, red's for dead ends,

05:48.473 --> 05:50.975
but the answer has got to be
here somewhere.

05:51.059 --> 05:53.478
Laura, I do believe Walton's lying to us.

05:53.561 --> 05:58.191
But a real investigation, it's not about
some, like, big "aha" moment, you know.

05:58.274 --> 06:02.028
It's about following leads
and talking to people and--

06:03.279 --> 06:06.324
Wait a second. This timeline here.
This is from Dad's file?

06:06.407 --> 06:09.285
Yes! See! Aha. Go, case board!
Should I get more yarn?

06:09.369 --> 06:10.953
I think we're fine, yarn-wise.

06:11.037 --> 06:13.706
It's just, you know, cops, they usually--

06:13.790 --> 06:17.960
what, they run license plates
when they do traffic stops, right?

06:18.044 --> 06:21.798
But it looks like Dad ran a bunch
every Wednesday afternoon.

06:23.758 --> 06:27.387
Wait. Wait. Wednesdays, Wednesdays.

06:29.305 --> 06:31.140
Wednesdays, Wednesdays. I--

06:32.308 --> 06:33.601
Grandpa Fun Day.

06:33.684 --> 06:37.563
Every Wednesday, Dad would take
Matthew out on the town. Just them.

06:38.314 --> 06:40.066
Huh. We should talk to Matt.

06:40.149 --> 06:42.193
- Hey, Matt.
- No, no, no, no. No.

06:42.276 --> 06:45.613
If Matthew finds out that Dad was using it
as a cover for an investigation,

06:45.696 --> 06:46.697
it'll break his heart.

06:46.781 --> 06:48.282
Don't say anything.
I'll think of something.

06:48.366 --> 06:49.951
- Can I have my face back? Thank you.
- Yeah.

06:50.034 --> 06:51.577
Did you call me, Uncle Scott?

06:52.286 --> 06:57.041
Hey. Yeah.
Just seeing how Make Blob Move was going.

06:57.125 --> 06:59.544
It's going great.
They're having a fun time.

07:03.005 --> 07:04.006
- We should go.
- Yeah.

07:08.428 --> 07:09.429
Yeah.

07:09.512 --> 07:12.807
All right, folks,
pay attention, 'cause this is big.

07:12.890 --> 07:15.351
Just spoke
with WITSEC regional chief inspector.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.478
We almost lost someone
in witness protection yesterday.

07:17.562 --> 07:19.230
What?
What? Seriously?

07:19.313 --> 07:21.441
- Hey, hey, hey. It's okay, buddy.
Name's Roland Byer.

07:21.524 --> 07:24.485
Accountant.
He testified against the Russian mob.

07:24.569 --> 07:26.988
Lived in Alameda for ten years
under a new name.

07:27.071 --> 07:30.241
Slipped up once to call his dying mom.

07:30.324 --> 07:33.578
He was attacked in his yard
the very next day.

07:33.661 --> 07:35.997
He's currently in a coma
at John Book Medical Center.

07:36.080 --> 07:38.416
They tapped his mom's phone for a decade?

07:38.499 --> 07:39.876
The Volkov crime family is ruthless.

07:39.959 --> 07:43.838
Chances are, their hit man will try again.
We need to catch him first.

07:43.921 --> 07:48.259
Now, it won't be easy. We don't have
a description, very few leads.

07:48.342 --> 07:50.803
But the US Marshals have never
lost someone in WITSEC,

07:50.887 --> 07:53.222
and that's not going to change
on my watch.

07:53.306 --> 07:54.307
Or mine.

07:56.434 --> 07:57.894
Yep.

07:59.353 --> 08:01.814
Well, I mean, it's your watch.
It's not mine. It's yours.

08:01.898 --> 08:03.816
I'll just watch wherever you need.
Overwatch.

08:03.900 --> 08:05.985
Even-watch.
It's more of an under-watch, really.

08:06.068 --> 08:07.945
- Watch out.
- See-- Shut up.

08:08.446 --> 08:09.572
Yeah.

08:10.072 --> 08:13.242
Okay, as of now, everyone not assigned
to court is on this,

08:13.326 --> 08:14.994
so come and get your assignments.

08:19.665 --> 08:22.960
How are we supposed to do a manhunt
with no description or leads?

08:23.044 --> 08:25.713
Sometimes when you're out surfing
and you can't find the wave,

08:25.796 --> 08:26.797
the wave finds you.

08:27.840 --> 08:30.426
You know that's the worst metaphor
ever, don't you?

08:30.510 --> 08:34.180
Like, in a manhunt,
the guy you're hunting never finds you.

08:34.263 --> 08:35.806
If you're saying the hit man is the wave?

08:35.890 --> 08:40.394
Well, the wave can be anything.
Or anyone. The wave is the unexpected.

08:40.978 --> 08:42.188
I disagree.

08:42.271 --> 08:43.481
- Turner.
- Huh?

08:43.564 --> 08:48.444
Chief's got a special assignment for you.
Wants to see you in his office. Hooch too.

08:48.528 --> 08:49.529
X.

08:49.612 --> 08:51.489
No, no, no. X.

08:51.572 --> 08:54.116
Don't you dare say
that the chief is the wave.

08:54.200 --> 08:55.368
I don't have to.

08:55.451 --> 08:56.452
You just did.

08:56.536 --> 08:58.162
No, I did not.

08:58.996 --> 09:00.831
<i>I'm sorry. Please stop.</i>

09:00.915 --> 09:04.627
<i>Anthony, it's okay. We're all finished.
We're gonna go home, okay? Deep breaths.</i>

09:05.419 --> 09:07.505
The kid lives with his mom
next door to Byer.

09:07.588 --> 09:10.007
He was climbing a tree
when he saw the attack over the fence.

09:10.091 --> 09:11.092
He started screaming.

09:11.175 --> 09:13.052
Hit man ran off
before he could finish the job.

09:13.135 --> 09:15.596
Cops got nothing from him.
I need you to do better.

09:16.472 --> 09:17.890
He looks pretty upset.

09:17.974 --> 09:19.100
He's on the autism spectrum.

09:19.183 --> 09:22.895
I don't know the details, but he needs
a softer hand than the cops used.

09:22.979 --> 09:24.397
Doesn't the FBI have therapists?

09:24.480 --> 09:26.148
I put in a request, but they're backed up.

09:26.232 --> 09:28.651
We need a description now.
You're all we've got.

09:28.734 --> 09:31.821
You know, I appreciate you think
so highly of me, sir, but I don't--

09:31.904 --> 09:35.825
No. I didn't say I think highly of you.
I said that you're all we've got.

09:35.908 --> 09:39.161
- If the vending machine only has Funyuns--
- Well, you get the Funyuns.

09:39.245 --> 09:41.956
- Bingo. Look--
- A-7. In the breakroom-- Sorry.

09:42.039 --> 09:44.166
I think that you can do this.
You're good with kids.

09:44.250 --> 09:45.459
You've got this dippy charm.

09:45.543 --> 09:46.544
Thanks.

09:46.627 --> 09:49.088
Uh, but I don't know
the first thing about autism.

09:49.171 --> 09:51.716
This kid is the only one
who saw the hit man.

09:51.799 --> 09:54.927
Every second we're talking here,
that boy's life's in danger.

09:55.011 --> 09:58.264
- Yes, but--
- Every second, Turner. Go.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.773
Hey. You guys working together?

10:07.857 --> 10:09.025
Yeah, unfortunately.

10:09.859 --> 10:11.193
We could've been on the manhunt,

10:11.277 --> 10:14.155
but X got us put on guard duty
with a witness at the hospital.

10:14.238 --> 10:16.907
- Totally out of the action.
- There's plenty of action in a hospital.

10:16.991 --> 10:18.618
We're guarding a guy in a coma, bro.

10:18.701 --> 10:20.578
The only action's gonna be
watching his beard grow.

10:20.661 --> 10:23.623
Yeah, but at a hospital
you got births, deaths.

10:24.206 --> 10:25.916
The cycle of life is a beautiful thing.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.169
- The hell you talking about?
- We'll do good there.

10:28.961 --> 10:29.962
I can feel it.

10:30.046 --> 10:31.672
And good luck with the kid, Scott.

10:39.347 --> 10:43.934
I know this is hard,
but I do need to talk to your son.

10:44.018 --> 10:48.939
Now? After the attack and the way
the police treated him, I'm not so sure.

10:49.023 --> 10:53.361
I'll be very sensitive to his condition.
If you have any tips.

10:53.444 --> 10:54.654
Tips?

10:54.737 --> 10:58.658
Anthony gets overstimulated easily.
He doesn't like to be touched.

10:59.450 --> 11:03.371
- Also, what is this? A small horse?

11:03.454 --> 11:05.956
Hooch is a French Mastiff.
He's great with kids.

11:06.540 --> 11:09.669
If we don't catch this guy, we'll have
to move you for your own protection,

11:09.752 --> 11:12.004
so unless you wanna start packing...

11:12.088 --> 11:13.881
- No, no, no!

11:13.964 --> 11:15.591
-<i>Platz</i>! <i>Platz</i>!

11:15.675 --> 11:16.592
Sorry.

11:17.176 --> 11:19.970
I said the word P-A-C-K-I-N-G,

11:20.054 --> 11:22.223
and I think it sounded similar
to a command

11:22.306 --> 11:23.891
he learned at attack dog training.

11:23.974 --> 11:26.310
- He's an attack dog?
- Yeah. No. No.

11:26.394 --> 11:28.229
Kind of. He wasn't very good at it.

11:29.563 --> 11:32.233
This is going well. Let's do this.

11:32.316 --> 11:35.569
Why don't I leave Hooch here,
I'll go inside and talk with Anthony.

11:35.653 --> 11:37.154
We'll take it slow.

11:37.238 --> 11:38.864
Just what you're comfortable with.

11:40.074 --> 11:41.075
Okay.

11:41.158 --> 11:42.159
Great.

11:42.243 --> 11:43.244
Hey.

11:45.913 --> 11:47.790
Now you're an attack dog?

11:49.625 --> 11:51.961
Anthony?

11:52.044 --> 11:53.295
This is Deputy Turner.

11:54.004 --> 11:55.214
Nice to meet you, Anthony.

11:55.965 --> 11:57.508
You can call me Scott.

11:59.176 --> 12:00.469
Is it okay if I sit?

12:01.053 --> 12:01.929
Yeah.

12:06.183 --> 12:09.019
That's a cool drawing, dude.
Do you like trains?

12:10.354 --> 12:12.732
He loves them. Draws every single detail.

12:12.815 --> 12:15.735
Never misses a spoke.
Never leaves a drawing unfinished.

12:16.444 --> 12:19.822
Anthony, Deputy Turner needs
to ask some questions.

12:19.905 --> 12:22.491
But you don't have to answer
any you don't like, okay?

12:25.411 --> 12:26.412
Don't wanna talk?

12:27.329 --> 12:29.623
That's cool.
Sometimes I don't wanna talk either.

12:32.918 --> 12:37.465
Maybe you'd like to look at some
pictures instead? Would that be cool?

12:38.799 --> 12:42.636
Do any of these look like the man
you saw who hurt your neighbor?

12:45.514 --> 12:46.766
All right.

12:46.849 --> 12:50.269
Well, just in case you wanna look at 'em,
I will leave 'em right here.

12:50.352 --> 12:52.313
Wait.

12:53.230 --> 12:55.733
Sorry. I didn't... realize. It's--

12:55.816 --> 12:57.985
Anthony, Scott's here to help.

12:59.820 --> 13:04.116
Hey, do you maybe
wanna point to a marker instead?

13:04.784 --> 13:07.620
To show me what color hair
the bad man had?

13:08.454 --> 13:10.706
Was it, um...

13:10.790 --> 13:12.625
- He doesn't like being touched--

13:12.708 --> 13:14.251
- Sorry. I forgot.
- Anthony. Anthony.

13:14.335 --> 13:16.128
- Honey. It's okay.

13:19.215 --> 13:21.300
- It's okay. Anthony.

13:21.383 --> 13:23.344
Oh, my God! Stop him!
- Hooch! No!

13:45.991 --> 13:48.953
- Maybe we should take a break.
- Yeah.

14:16.939 --> 14:18.357
Blah!

14:18.440 --> 14:20.109
You still playing Make Blob Move?

14:20.192 --> 14:23.362
Yeah, it's not even fun anymore.
I just wanna win once!

14:24.780 --> 14:25.781
Yeah.

14:25.865 --> 14:29.785
There's gotta be something more fun than
scaring the world's laziest cat, right?

14:31.287 --> 14:33.247
Say, um...

14:33.914 --> 14:36.208
do you remember those Grandpa Fun Days?

14:36.292 --> 14:37.835
Yeah! They were the best.

14:37.918 --> 14:39.712
What if we did a Fun Day?

14:39.795 --> 14:42.381
Do everything
that you and Grandpa used to.

14:43.007 --> 14:44.508
I don't think you would like it.

14:44.592 --> 14:46.468
Why wouldn't I like it? I'm fun.

14:46.552 --> 14:48.971
Well, because Grandpa always used to say,

14:49.054 --> 14:53.058
"We can do all the fun stuff
that your mom doesn't like to do."

14:53.142 --> 14:54.476
- Oh, he did, did he?
- Yeah.

14:54.560 --> 14:56.270
Okay, challenge accepted.

14:56.353 --> 14:58.397
You're taking me on a Fun Day.
I'll have fun.

14:58.981 --> 15:01.317
But do you promise to do everything?

15:01.400 --> 15:02.776
Everything.

15:02.860 --> 15:03.861
Awesome!

15:03.944 --> 15:05.821
So, first we have to go to the woods

15:05.905 --> 15:08.324
and dig for worms in the muddy area
at the trees at the park.

15:08.407 --> 15:09.408
Uh-huh.

15:09.491 --> 15:11.619
Then we would use those worms
to go fishing.

15:11.702 --> 15:14.371
Then Grandpa would clean the fish
and then cook 'em for snacks.

15:15.915 --> 15:17.082
Okay.

15:17.166 --> 15:20.336
So, worms and cleaning fish.

15:20.419 --> 15:22.588
Yeah, basically.
And then we'd get ice cream.

15:23.172 --> 15:25.341
- Great! Let's go have fun.
- Yeah!

15:35.184 --> 15:37.269
"Fun day." Real fun.

15:39.355 --> 15:40.773
Fishing area.

15:43.567 --> 15:45.653
- What were you seeing, Dad?

15:45.736 --> 15:47.988
Hey, Mom? This ice cream's yummy.

15:48.072 --> 15:50.908
Are you sure you don't want one?
I thought you liked ice cream.

15:50.991 --> 15:51.992
I love ice cream.

15:52.076 --> 15:55.287
But I'm covered in mud and fish goo
and worm juice from our Fun Day.

15:55.371 --> 15:56.997
So, you know, maybe later.

15:57.081 --> 15:59.166
All right. Your loss.

15:59.249 --> 16:02.002
Hey, kiddo. I'm just wondering,
is this all you did on Grandpa Fun Day?

16:02.086 --> 16:03.671
There wasn't anything else?

16:05.297 --> 16:09.301
Well, sometimes we got two ice creams.

16:09.385 --> 16:12.304
We should probably do that
before we clean the fish.

16:12.388 --> 16:14.723
You know, just for the full experience?

16:14.807 --> 16:18.185
Yeah. Okay. Here you go.
Knock yourself out.

16:19.520 --> 16:20.646
Score!

16:22.731 --> 16:24.942
"Fishing area. Gross."

16:26.694 --> 16:28.070
- Okay, Helen, you ready?
- Sure am.

16:28.153 --> 16:29.321
Double or nothing. Let's go.

16:30.864 --> 16:31.865
Not again.

16:31.949 --> 16:34.868
- Good game, Dr. Terry. Don't change.

16:35.577 --> 16:37.579
- What are you doing?
- My job.

16:38.122 --> 16:42.042
Dude, what are you talking about? Our job
is to guard that door and that door only.

16:42.126 --> 16:44.503
- Our job is to keep Roland Byer safe.
- Same difference.

16:44.586 --> 16:46.839
How is talking to every person that works
here gonna keep Roland Byer safe?

16:46.922 --> 16:48.090
I don't know yet.

16:48.173 --> 16:50.342
Larry the Ladies' Man.
Looking good in all white.

16:50.426 --> 16:51.427
You know it.

16:51.510 --> 16:52.720
What do you think is gonna happen?

16:52.803 --> 16:57.349
Larry the Ladies' Man is gonna teach
you medicine? Find a cure to a coma?

16:57.433 --> 16:59.309
Yeah, a coma's not a disease.

16:59.393 --> 17:01.437
It's a deep state
of prolonged unconsciousness.

17:01.520 --> 17:04.356
Or perhaps an alternate consciousness,
like a shamanic journey.

17:05.232 --> 17:06.942
I don't like it when you talk to me.

17:07.026 --> 17:08.027
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:08.110 --> 17:10.487
- Did you guys see the chief?
- Yeah, he's in with Byer.

17:10.571 --> 17:12.573
Turner, you ride with this nutjob.

17:12.656 --> 17:15.659
Is there an instruction manual
or a mute button? An off button?

17:15.743 --> 17:16.827
A lot of protein in nuts.

17:16.910 --> 17:18.120
Any button?

17:18.203 --> 17:21.040
No. You just gotta ride the wave.

17:21.123 --> 17:23.834
- What is with the waves? I hate waves.
- Just gotta ride 'em.

17:23.917 --> 17:25.919
- Hey, do you mind?
- Yeah, I do mind.

17:26.003 --> 17:28.422
- I'm loving the chemistry I'm seeing here.
- That's not chemistry.

17:28.505 --> 17:29.923
- It's biology.
- It's not either.

17:38.557 --> 17:40.517
You know how Byer wound up in WITSEC?

17:41.894 --> 17:44.688
Ten years ago, an ambitious deputy
promised to protect him.

17:45.522 --> 17:47.858
Guarded him 24-7 during the trial.

17:47.941 --> 17:53.489
And when he got scared, convinced him
the Volkovs would never find him.

17:55.074 --> 17:56.658
That deputy was you, wasn't it?

17:58.702 --> 18:00.037
Tell me you got something.

18:00.120 --> 18:02.206
Honestly, things didn't go so well.

18:02.289 --> 18:03.832
What does that mean?

18:03.916 --> 18:05.167
He wouldn't talk to me.

18:06.502 --> 18:09.755
The highlight was Hooch dragging a tree
into their living room.

18:09.838 --> 18:11.256
Maybe if we had an expert--

18:11.340 --> 18:12.841
I told you, Turner.

18:13.926 --> 18:15.052
I already tried.

18:16.303 --> 18:18.305
You need an expert? Go find one.

18:19.389 --> 18:20.390
Yes, sir.

18:22.976 --> 18:26.522
You brought a dog trainer
to help talk to my son?

18:26.605 --> 18:31.068
Yes. But Erica's not just a dog trainer.
Her brother Curtis is autistic.

18:31.151 --> 18:32.402
And we're really close.

18:32.486 --> 18:33.529
But you train dogs?

18:33.612 --> 18:35.030
- Yep.
- Yeah.

18:35.114 --> 18:37.741
So, what are you gonna do?
Teach Anthony to roll over?

18:38.575 --> 18:42.913
Looks like he already knows how, so...
Better come up with another plan.

18:42.996 --> 18:46.875
Listen, I'm his mom,
and he rarely speaks to me.

18:46.959 --> 18:49.545
The idea that he'll just talk
to someone he's never met--

18:49.628 --> 18:52.464
I understand. I do. Trust me.

18:52.548 --> 18:54.424
But dogs can be really helpful here.

18:54.508 --> 18:56.677
Their emotions are simpler.

18:57.302 --> 19:00.472
It's easier for someone on the spectrum
to relate to.

19:01.306 --> 19:04.017
- Connecting with us? I mean, scary.
- Yeah.

19:04.101 --> 19:04.935
Hooch though...

19:06.728 --> 19:07.729
I don't know.

19:11.316 --> 19:12.317
I guess you can try.

19:12.401 --> 19:13.944
Great.
- Thank you.

19:15.070 --> 19:17.447
- Ready?
- Yeah. Ready for what?

19:21.577 --> 19:26.206
Look, I really appreciate you coming.
Like, totally, totally appreciate it.

19:26.290 --> 19:28.750
- But I don't get it.
- Don't get what?

19:28.834 --> 19:31.461
You want me to crawl around
like a dog with Anthony?

19:31.545 --> 19:32.963
Mm-hmm. And Hooch.

19:33.046 --> 19:35.382
But I'm supposed to be getting
the description of a suspect.

19:35.465 --> 19:37.217
But this is a great way to build trust.

19:37.301 --> 19:40.220
It requires no eye contact.
You'll be working in parallel.

19:41.096 --> 19:42.097
Okay.

19:43.807 --> 19:46.518
But I just-- Is there another way?

19:46.602 --> 19:51.190
'Cause there's cameras everywhere
and deputies monitoring those cameras.

19:51.273 --> 19:54.234
And if the footage got out...
I can already see the memes.

19:54.318 --> 19:56.445
Yeah. Me too. Fun!

19:56.528 --> 19:58.822
It's embarrassing. Really embarrassing.

19:58.906 --> 20:00.032
Oh.

20:02.034 --> 20:03.035
I have a question.

20:03.118 --> 20:06.413
If the hit man we're looking for were
to come here right now with a gun,

20:06.496 --> 20:07.497
what would you do?

20:09.791 --> 20:11.835
I would protect Anthony, of course.

20:11.919 --> 20:14.963
So, you would jump in front of a bullet
to save him,

20:15.047 --> 20:17.216
but you won't crawl on the ground?

20:17.925 --> 20:19.885
Yeah, yeah. No, that makes sense.

20:22.763 --> 20:23.764
Lead the way.

20:33.899 --> 20:35.400
- Scott?
- Yo.

20:35.484 --> 20:37.361
I've never seen a dog move like that.

20:38.111 --> 20:40.614
Oh. There was one. I think he had worms.

20:40.697 --> 20:44.785
I don't have worms, okay. I'm a dog.
I'm on the ground. We're dogging.

20:44.868 --> 20:46.411
What's up, dog? I'm on the ground.

20:46.495 --> 20:50.874
You look like an embarrassed
deputy marshal. Or a constipated duck.

20:51.458 --> 20:54.878
Quack! I mean quick! Hurry.
Think dog. They're coming.

20:54.962 --> 20:56.838
Um... whoo-hoo!

20:56.922 --> 20:58.465
Being a dog's so fun!

20:58.548 --> 20:59.758
Dogs don't talk.

20:59.841 --> 21:01.301
The whole idea's to get him to talk.

21:01.385 --> 21:02.761
Connect first. Talk after.

21:02.844 --> 21:04.972
Come on. Dogs are fun.

21:05.055 --> 21:06.682
Just be fun!

21:06.765 --> 21:09.142
Fun. I'm the funnest! I'm very fun.

21:09.226 --> 21:10.310
- Whoo!

21:11.186 --> 21:13.272
Oh-ho-ho!

21:44.678 --> 21:47.472
Huh?

21:58.608 --> 21:59.651
Yeah.

22:06.742 --> 22:08.160
So, let me get this straight.

22:08.243 --> 22:10.996
Every Wednesday your dad did
all this stuff in the park?

22:11.079 --> 22:12.581
And then he ran license plates?

22:12.664 --> 22:15.042
Exactly. And I'm just trying
to figure out what it all means.

22:15.125 --> 22:18.587
It means he had a great metabolism.
Ice cream every week.

22:19.921 --> 22:23.508
I'm looking for something a little deeper.
I mean, you were his partner.

22:23.592 --> 22:25.010
That was 30 years ago.

22:25.594 --> 22:29.014
They played "U Can't Touch This"
at my retirement party.

22:29.097 --> 22:30.932
And I did the MC Hammer dance.

22:31.641 --> 22:32.976
I would have paid to see that.

22:34.519 --> 22:39.441
Think about it for me, David.
I mean, it doesn't make any sense.

22:39.524 --> 22:42.444
These license plate numbers
that he was running were for fancy cars.

22:42.527 --> 22:46.239
Escalades and Jaguars.
But the things he was doing with Matthew.

22:46.323 --> 22:50.827
Well, A, were super gross and,
B, not even near any major roads.

22:50.911 --> 22:55.040
But he was getting the license plate
numbers from somewhere. Somehow.

22:55.123 --> 22:56.375
Well, here's the thing.

22:56.458 --> 23:00.379
Do you remember that big case your dad
and I did in '89? With the original Hooch?

23:00.462 --> 23:02.756
Um, the one from the newspaper article

23:02.839 --> 23:04.674
that was taped to my fridge
my entire childhood?

23:04.758 --> 23:06.093
Yeah, it rings a bell.

23:06.176 --> 23:08.929
Well, your dad,
he just saw things differently.

23:09.513 --> 23:11.139
We saw ice blocks.

23:11.223 --> 23:13.308
He saw a way to ship drug money.

23:13.392 --> 23:17.396
We saw a big slobbery dog,
and he saw a clue to a murder.

23:18.105 --> 23:19.606
So, what are you saying?

23:19.689 --> 23:21.650
He saw what things could be.

23:23.652 --> 23:28.281
But what did he see in worms
and a stinky lake? And fish guts?

23:28.365 --> 23:30.617
Well, that's the million-dollar question.

23:30.700 --> 23:34.371
And just one of the million reasons
I wish that he was still around.

23:34.955 --> 23:35.956
Me too.

23:36.498 --> 23:37.791
We just gotta keep looking.

23:38.375 --> 23:42.629
But I'll tell you this, it's very nice
working with a Turner again.

23:44.005 --> 23:45.549
Mm-hmm.

23:54.808 --> 23:56.893
Hooch. Come on.

24:13.160 --> 24:15.871
Scott! What up, dog?

24:15.954 --> 24:17.831
- Woof woof woof!
-<i>Super funny.</i>

24:17.914 --> 24:20.041
Inside's secure.
What's it looking like out there?

24:20.125 --> 24:22.377
A whole lot of nothing.

24:22.461 --> 24:25.255
Anyone sets foot in this yard,
we'll be on them like white on rice.

24:25.338 --> 24:29.509
Just remember this hit man is very good
at what he does. Right?

24:29.593 --> 24:33.597
He avoided every traffic cam,
every doorbell cam in the neighborhood.

24:33.680 --> 24:37.017
Even after he stabbed Byer,
he got away completely clean.

24:37.100 --> 24:39.603
Yeah. Well,
that was before we were on the case.

24:39.686 --> 24:40.937
No one's gonna hurt this kid.

24:41.021 --> 24:42.355
<i>Thank you.</i>

25:28.276 --> 25:30.153
You're like Angel when she's nervous.

25:30.237 --> 25:32.155
Upstairs, downstairs,
upstairs, downstairs.

25:32.239 --> 25:33.907
- You bark in your sleep too?
- Mmm.

25:34.533 --> 25:36.535
Yeah, I don't think I'll be sleeping much

25:36.618 --> 25:38.912
knowing there's a killer out there
coming for Anthony.

25:40.830 --> 25:42.374
Thought I'd have something by now.

25:43.041 --> 25:45.043
You're making great progress.

25:45.126 --> 25:48.838
He didn't throw his trains at you today.
His mom said that's a really big deal.

25:49.464 --> 25:50.590
Yeah.

25:51.341 --> 25:53.635
How do we get to the next step, you know?

25:54.302 --> 25:56.304
Like, how did you--

25:56.972 --> 25:59.683
How did you get Curtis to open up
when you were kids?

25:59.766 --> 26:02.227
I don't know.

26:02.310 --> 26:05.188
Stupid stuff. You wouldn't get it.

26:05.272 --> 26:06.856
You're not embarrassed, are you?

26:06.940 --> 26:10.277
You were embarrassed
about playing dog, so...

26:10.360 --> 26:11.945
Whoa. That's very different.

26:12.028 --> 26:15.156
Biting a toy and burying it in the garden.
That's objectively embarrassing.

26:15.699 --> 26:17.367
What's so bad? You were a kid.

26:18.577 --> 26:19.911
Um...

26:20.704 --> 26:25.250
Okay. When we were kids, all Curtis wanted
to do was dress up as Aladdin

26:25.333 --> 26:29.671
and build our dog, Remi,
these forts out of cushions.

26:29.754 --> 26:33.508
He did it every day.
Same thing. Wouldn't even look at me.

26:34.217 --> 26:35.218
So, what did you do?

26:35.802 --> 26:40.348
So, I finally asked my mom
for a Princess Jasmine costume,

26:40.432 --> 26:42.809
and I just started helping him build.

26:43.476 --> 26:44.978
And then he started talking to you?

26:45.061 --> 26:46.896
No, not exactly.

26:47.897 --> 26:49.899
But it got us in the same fort, so...

26:49.983 --> 26:51.776
But when did the talking start?

26:53.028 --> 26:56.948
This is the embarrassing part.
You know the song "MMMBop"?

26:57.032 --> 26:58.950
Of course. I had a childhood.

26:59.034 --> 27:00.952
That was Curtis's favorite song.

27:01.036 --> 27:07.167
And I discovered that he wouldn't listen
to me if I talked to him,

27:07.250 --> 27:11.880
but he would listen to me
if I sang what I wanted to say

27:12.672 --> 27:15.050
as long as it was to the tune of "MMMBop."

27:15.634 --> 27:16.968
I'm gonna need you to show me.

27:17.052 --> 27:20.013
See, that's why I didn't want to tell you
'cause I knew you were gonna ask me that,

27:20.096 --> 27:21.097
and no.

27:21.181 --> 27:24.559
It's not for me.
It's for the federal investigation, right.

27:24.643 --> 27:27.145
- Right.
- You have to. I'm a federal agent.

27:27.228 --> 27:29.189
Yeah. Okay. Okay.

27:29.272 --> 27:31.524
- Yeah.
- Yeah, so it's like...

27:34.819 --> 27:38.698
♪ <i>Hey, Scott
This is how I talk, Scott</i> ♪

27:38.782 --> 27:43.328
♪ <i>And now I'm doing it here, Scott
'Cause you forced me to</i> ♪

27:43.411 --> 27:45.288
♪ <i>Yeah, yeah</i> ♪

27:45.372 --> 27:47.582
- That was incredible.
- That was weird.

27:48.500 --> 27:50.377
Yeah, I know. I know, okay.

27:51.002 --> 27:55.256
I know with Curtis
and my dog stuff and everything,

27:55.340 --> 27:58.301
you're just like, "Oh, she's so weird."

27:59.219 --> 28:01.179
Well, maybe I like weird.

28:06.309 --> 28:07.310
You do?

28:13.024 --> 28:16.236
What is it, boy? You hear something?

28:33.837 --> 28:35.463
- Hey.
-<i>What's going on out there?</i>

28:35.547 --> 28:37.048
Nothing on the monitor. Why?

28:37.132 --> 28:39.551
Hooch was growling.
You don't see anything out there?

28:39.634 --> 28:42.053
Just the yard.
The same that it's been all night.

28:43.304 --> 28:44.806
I'm gonna go take a look around.

28:46.516 --> 28:47.851
All right. I'll stay on the line.

28:54.941 --> 28:56.317
Hooch.

29:01.322 --> 29:03.158
- Hooch, what's going on?
- Scott!

29:03.241 --> 29:04.909
Freeze! US Marshals!

29:04.993 --> 29:06.327
Anthony, stay in the room!

29:09.998 --> 29:12.250
Stay down.
Don't let Anthony out of his room.

29:12.333 --> 29:14.210
Anthony! Anthony!
- He's safe. Don't open the door!

29:15.670 --> 29:17.922
Hit man! Second floor. Southeast room.

29:18.923 --> 29:21.176
Anthony, Mama's here. It's okay.

29:27.891 --> 29:31.561
Scott! He ran over the neighbor's roof.
He got away.

29:40.737 --> 29:43.031
He used a tree to escape
over the neighbor's roof.

29:43.114 --> 29:46.284
We-- We searched the area,
but were unable to locate the suspect.

29:46.367 --> 29:48.661
This is bad. We can't take
the chance this happens again.

29:48.745 --> 29:52.165
We need to move
the kid, his mother, Byer, everyone.

29:52.248 --> 29:53.625
Chief, if we had more time, I--

29:53.708 --> 29:57.045
This guy snuck past six cameras,
scaled the house,

29:57.128 --> 29:59.339
climbed through the trees
and almost killed our witness.

29:59.422 --> 30:00.423
We're out of time.

30:00.507 --> 30:05.094
I know. I know it's a serious situation.
It's just Anthony and I are connecting.

30:05.178 --> 30:07.514
You can connect in the safe house.
We move everyone first thing.

30:07.597 --> 30:08.556
That's final.

30:14.062 --> 30:16.523
It's okay. It's okay.

30:17.816 --> 30:20.151
Hey, I just wanted to check on you.

30:22.737 --> 30:25.698
Hooch is fine.
Yeah, I think he's worried about Anthony.

30:25.782 --> 30:27.408
He keeps trying to go inside, but--

30:27.492 --> 30:30.453
I mean, maybe we should let him
because Anthony was pretty upset.

30:30.537 --> 30:33.790
Well, we can deal with that in a minute.
I was asking about you.

30:33.873 --> 30:37.794
Oh, uh... I'm fine.

30:37.877 --> 30:38.920
Yeah, I think.

30:40.088 --> 30:43.299
I've never had a knife thrown at me,
so that's, like, new.

30:43.383 --> 30:46.928
It's okay to be freaked out. I am.

30:49.556 --> 30:52.475
Can I-- Would you mind--

30:53.059 --> 30:54.227
Yeah. Yeah.

30:55.812 --> 30:58.189
It's okay. He's gone.

31:00.692 --> 31:01.901
It's gonna be okay.

31:07.323 --> 31:08.658
Grandpa Fun Days.

31:08.741 --> 31:12.954
What do you have to do
with license plates? Or is it the lake?

31:14.289 --> 31:16.165
What would they do on <i>Murder, She Wrote</i>?

31:17.208 --> 31:19.377
Mom, what are you doing?

31:19.460 --> 31:21.921
I was just-- Why are you awake?

31:22.005 --> 31:27.427
I was in bed, but I kept on hearing
you say, "Speak to me. Speak to me."

31:27.510 --> 31:29.512
Well, you were probably
just having a dream.

31:29.596 --> 31:31.973
Come on, let me get you some milk.
Would you like that?

31:32.056 --> 31:35.184
Those are photos from today. Why?

31:39.355 --> 31:40.481
Come here, kiddo.

31:41.608 --> 31:42.650
Um...

31:43.818 --> 31:44.819
I'm really sorry.

31:44.903 --> 31:48.781
I should have told you exactly what I was
doing, but I didn't wanna upset you.

31:48.865 --> 31:50.658
I think I'm already upset.

31:52.035 --> 31:54.120
Yep. I am. I'm upset.

31:54.203 --> 31:55.747
Yeah, I hear that.

31:55.830 --> 31:58.958
You know that Grandpa loved
your Fun Days, right?

31:59.042 --> 32:01.544
And this doesn't change that,
not even a tiny little bit.

32:01.628 --> 32:07.008
But I think that Grandpa was also doing
some investigating during Fun Days.

32:07.091 --> 32:08.468
He loved you so much.

32:08.551 --> 32:10.845
I know you're probably mad
he was investigating--

32:10.929 --> 32:13.306
I'm not mad he was investigating.

32:13.389 --> 32:16.267
I'm mad that you didn't tell me.
I could have helped.

32:16.351 --> 32:18.853
No, you're a kid.
You shouldn't have to worry about--

32:18.937 --> 32:20.563
Mom, I'm already worried.

32:21.189 --> 32:24.192
I know you don't think I know
about your investigation with Uncle Scott,

32:24.275 --> 32:25.276
but I do.

32:26.194 --> 32:28.780
I'm not seven anymore. I'm eight!

32:29.447 --> 32:31.282
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

32:32.617 --> 32:35.370
This thing that your Uncle Scott
and I have to do for our dad--

32:35.453 --> 32:38.539
He's your dad. But he's my grandpa.

32:43.795 --> 32:44.796
You're right.

32:45.588 --> 32:46.631
You really wanna help?

32:47.799 --> 32:50.677
What do you say we start tomorrow?
Does that work for you?

32:50.760 --> 32:54.806
I may have to move some things,
but I think I'm available.

32:54.889 --> 32:55.974
Okay, good.

32:56.641 --> 33:00.478
Right now, you and I need to get
some sleep. Okay? Come on, kiddo.

33:06.317 --> 33:09.529
I don't understand.
You can't even tell us where we're going?

33:09.612 --> 33:12.281
That's why they call it
an undisclosed location because--

33:12.365 --> 33:15.410
Well, we don't disclose it.
It's for your own protection.

33:15.493 --> 33:17.495
What about my job? I'm a single mom.

33:17.578 --> 33:19.664
It's the annual Spa-tacular sale
next week.

33:19.747 --> 33:21.457
That's half the hot tub sales
for the year.

33:21.541 --> 33:24.919
Well, when we apprehend the suspect,
you can return to selling hot tubs.

33:25.003 --> 33:27.755
The guy we're after
is incredibly dangerous.

33:27.839 --> 33:30.550
You were the ones
who moved a criminal in next door.

33:30.633 --> 33:32.093
Anthony can't handle this, okay?

33:32.176 --> 33:35.763
He unravels if a fork's in the wrong place
or his trains aren't lined up--

33:35.847 --> 33:38.891
I know it's hard.
But it's the only way to keep him safe.

33:38.975 --> 33:40.727
I'm sorry. We need to go.

33:40.810 --> 33:43.688
Just pack what you need, and we can
send a deputy back for the rest.

33:43.771 --> 33:45.523
I need you to sign some paperwork.

33:45.606 --> 33:48.359
Scott. Scott, Scott.
Can I just show you something?

33:51.070 --> 33:52.196
I'm in the middle of something.

33:52.780 --> 33:57.493
Yes, but there's another something.
An important something. Please?

33:58.661 --> 33:59.662
I'll be right back.

34:00.997 --> 34:02.957
Go. Go.

34:03.875 --> 34:06.544
I am so sorry to interrupt,
but I had to show you this right away.

34:08.254 --> 34:09.839
It's great they're playing with trains,

34:09.922 --> 34:12.133
but we're way past
the bonding-with-Anthony stage.

34:12.216 --> 34:14.510
No, no, no. Not bonding. Teaching.

34:14.594 --> 34:17.722
Anthony is teaching Hooch
how to push his train.

34:18.806 --> 34:19.849
We can use this.

34:19.932 --> 34:24.687
I gotta help Zoe P-A-C-K, okay?
Can we talk about this at the safe house?

34:24.771 --> 34:27.815
But what if we don't have to go
to the safe house? That's my point.

34:27.899 --> 34:28.900
What do you mean?

34:28.983 --> 34:32.320
Okay, when Curtis was Anthony's age,
he was terrified of water.

34:32.403 --> 34:34.489
Oceans, showers, even puddles sometimes.

34:34.572 --> 34:36.199
We're teaching our dog how to swim,

34:36.282 --> 34:39.160
my dad's getting frustrated,
and Curtis dives in.

34:39.243 --> 34:40.953
To the water. And teaches him.

34:41.037 --> 34:42.038
I don't see how this--

34:42.121 --> 34:43.122
Not just swimming.

34:43.206 --> 34:46.042
When Remi wouldn't chase a tennis ball,
Curtis showed him how.

34:46.125 --> 34:48.294
When Remi didn't know how to roll over,
Curtis showed him how.

34:48.377 --> 34:50.088
When Remi didn't know
how to pee outside, Curtis--

34:50.171 --> 34:52.590
Understood. So you're suggesting...

34:53.549 --> 34:55.259
Uh, okay.

34:55.343 --> 34:58.262
Anthony won't tell us
what the hit man looked like, right?

34:58.346 --> 35:02.391
But if he thought Hooch needed his help,
maybe he would show us.

35:03.267 --> 35:06.229
I don't know exactly how to do it yet.

35:06.312 --> 35:10.066
I... I think I have an idea.

35:12.026 --> 35:13.027
Hold on.

35:17.990 --> 35:19.742
Hooch, come over here.

35:19.826 --> 35:21.410
This is very serious.

35:21.494 --> 35:25.206
I need to know what the bad man
you saw last night looked like.

35:25.289 --> 35:27.458
I need you to draw him
for me right now, Hooch.

35:27.542 --> 35:30.670
What did his eyes look like? His hair?

35:31.504 --> 35:33.506
Hooch, come here.

35:35.133 --> 35:40.721
Good, Hooch. I need you
to draw the bad man. Okay? Here.

35:41.639 --> 35:44.851
Take a marker. Take a marker, Hooch.

35:46.018 --> 35:50.439
No, we're not-- We're not bite--
Hooch. Hooch, this is very serious.

35:50.523 --> 35:54.443
I need you to draw the bad man
right now or no more treats.

35:57.989 --> 35:59.907
- No! Hooch.

35:59.991 --> 36:01.826
This is very serious, Hooch.

36:01.909 --> 36:06.789
Hold it. Hold it, Hooch.
Take the marker. Hold the marker.

36:06.873 --> 36:11.419
Go for it, Hooch.
Draw it all-- Yeah. Draw the bad man.

36:11.502 --> 36:13.045
Does he have an underbite?

36:14.797 --> 36:18.426
Double chins? Everything.
What is that? Come on.

36:18.509 --> 36:21.554
Don't stop, Hooch. Finish the drawing.

36:21.637 --> 36:24.182
- Turner, what are you doing?
- You're in trouble with the chief.

36:24.265 --> 36:26.100
- Come on, Hooch.
- He's getting your description. Quiet.

36:26.684 --> 36:27.894
- He's what?

36:27.977 --> 36:33.399
Hooch, this is just a scribble.
It's not a man. Bad dog. Try again.

36:35.943 --> 36:40.323
Hooch. Hooch, I need you
to finish this drawing right now,

36:40.406 --> 36:42.867
or I won't let you play
with Anthony anymore.

36:45.870 --> 36:46.871
Come on, Hooch.

36:52.251 --> 36:53.085
Yes!

36:53.169 --> 36:55.922
Watch Anthony, Hooch.
He's a better teacher than me.

36:59.508 --> 37:01.969
Are you sure about this?
I mean, his head looks like a yam.

37:02.053 --> 37:05.765
Look, I know it's not great art,
but I've seen Anthony draw.

37:05.848 --> 37:07.183
He's all about the details.

37:07.266 --> 37:10.770
If a train has 60 spokes,
he draws 60 spokes.

37:12.146 --> 37:13.272
All right.

37:16.275 --> 37:20.404
Darius, honey, millions of people install
their car seats every day

37:20.446 --> 37:22.865
without getting their hand caught
in the seat belt.

37:22.949 --> 37:24.742
- How did that even happ--

37:24.825 --> 37:28.496
Okay, I gotta go. You'll figure it out,
babe, okay? I believe in you.

37:29.830 --> 37:32.583
Hey, Chief. How are things going
out there? You guys get anything?

37:32.667 --> 37:33.709
Maybe, maybe not.

37:33.793 --> 37:36.170
I need you
to cross-reference a description

37:36.254 --> 37:38.798
with local PD and FBI Organized Crime.

37:38.881 --> 37:40.466
Okay. Copy that.

37:40.549 --> 37:46.138
Caucasian male, black hair, green eyes,
scar on left cheek.

37:46.222 --> 37:49.934
- Call me if you get anything.
- No. Actually, Chief. Hang on.

37:50.518 --> 37:53.896
Hang on. I did a deep dive
into the Volkov crime family,

37:53.980 --> 37:57.233
and there was something I remember...

37:58.025 --> 38:00.695
Aha. Murder in Trenton, three years ago.

38:00.778 --> 38:03.447
No picture, never found the guy,
but the assailant was described

38:03.531 --> 38:05.658
as green-eyed, black-haired,
Caucasian male.

38:05.741 --> 38:07.743
5'10" to 6', scar on the left cheek.

38:08.536 --> 38:10.496
Victim died of a stab to the back.

38:10.579 --> 38:11.872
- Knife?
- Mm-hmm.

38:11.956 --> 38:14.417
- That's our guy. That's our guy!
Yeah?

38:14.500 --> 38:17.044
Get that description
to all of our deputies in local PD.

38:17.128 --> 38:18.671
Okay. On it.

38:18.754 --> 38:21.090
- Let's get the family to the safe house.
- Yeah.

38:22.550 --> 38:26.262
You know he's in a coma, right?
He's not in great shape to travel.

38:26.846 --> 38:31.434
Or... is it perfect
because he's just, you know, laying there?

38:32.518 --> 38:35.104
All right. Well, I've got
some paperwork for you to sign.

38:35.187 --> 38:37.356
And he'll need
to visit the respiratory therapist

38:37.481 --> 38:40.943
to make sure he's intubated properly
before we put him in an ambulance.

38:41.027 --> 38:43.237
You and Lee take him to respiratory.
I'll handle this.

38:43.321 --> 38:46.532
Right. 'Cause you probably gotta
say bye to all your new friends.

38:46.615 --> 38:48.826
Yo, X. You in for the hold 'em tourney?

38:48.909 --> 38:50.995
- I gotta rain check, Eli.
- Come on.

38:51.078 --> 38:52.872
- You got my number though?
- You know I do.

38:52.955 --> 38:54.582
Sorry about the paperwork.
You know lawyers.

38:54.665 --> 38:57.293
It's all good. I find paperwork calming.

38:57.376 --> 39:00.713
<i>S-F-21 and S-F-33, this is S-F Base.</i>

39:00.796 --> 39:04.258
<i>suspect is 5'10 to 6', Caucasian male</i>

39:04.342 --> 39:06.052
<i>with black hair, green eyes
and left cheek scar.</i>

39:06.135 --> 39:08.512
- Just need two signatures.
- Okay, listen, listen. There's an orderly.

39:08.596 --> 39:11.015
Black hair, green eyes. Todd, I think?

39:11.098 --> 39:12.099
I'm not sure.

39:12.183 --> 39:15.394
No, he was working yesterday with Lesley
and that tech from Cincinnati, Andrea.

39:15.478 --> 39:16.687
Him. Yeah, I know him.

39:16.771 --> 39:19.023
- He just got hired a couple of days ago.
- Two days?

39:19.690 --> 39:22.401
- Where does he work?
- I think he's in the respiratory unit.

39:22.485 --> 39:24.945
- That's where they just went.
- Hey! What about the paperwork?

39:25.029 --> 39:27.406
Trent, come in. Trent, do you copy?

39:27.490 --> 39:29.784
<i>Can hear... Reception... in the up--</i>

39:29.867 --> 39:31.035
Trent!

39:32.286 --> 39:34.622
Jack! Zian! Out of the way!

39:40.503 --> 39:43.672
Trent! Get Todd's mask off.
We need to see his face!

39:43.756 --> 39:44.757
Who's Todd?

39:44.840 --> 39:47.510
The orderly! Behind you!
We need to see his face!

40:10.491 --> 40:12.493
Dr. Ermilio, get me through.

40:20.126 --> 40:22.294
Freeze! Get down! Get--

40:23.921 --> 40:24.964
Trent, you okay?

40:25.047 --> 40:27.007
I'm fine. I got Byer. Go, go!

40:27.633 --> 40:31.470
Suspect spotted!
Fourth floor respiratory unit!

40:31.554 --> 40:33.764
<i>Officer down. Lock down all exits!</i>

40:33.848 --> 40:36.559
- How fast can we get to the hospital?
- Couple of minutes. It's down the road.

40:36.642 --> 40:38.269
Will you stay with Anthony?
Make sure he's okay?

40:38.352 --> 40:41.772
- Yes! We can sing songs and color!
- Get them out of here. Go!

40:46.068 --> 40:49.947
<i>Code silver. Code silver.</i>

40:58.873 --> 41:01.792
- Luther? You okay?
- I'm fine.

41:01.876 --> 41:04.920
- Which way?
- East Wing. He took my gun!

41:05.713 --> 41:08.132
<i>Code silver. Code silver.</i>

41:08.215 --> 41:12.094
Suspect is armed and last seen headed
down East Wing. Anyone have a visual?

41:12.178 --> 41:13.179
<i>Negative on one.</i>

41:13.262 --> 41:15.139
<i>Negative on two.
Negative on three.</i>

41:15.222 --> 41:18.601
Okay. Keep the exits locked down.
All patients shelter in place now.

41:26.066 --> 41:28.611
X, it's Turner.
We're on the scene. Main entrance.

41:28.694 --> 41:32.323
Copy. Just finished clearing
the second floor. No sign of the suspect.

41:32.406 --> 41:33.782
He must be on the ground floor.

41:33.866 --> 41:36.827
Hey, main entrance is secure.
You take north, I'll take south.

41:36.911 --> 41:37.995
All right. Come on.

41:40.998 --> 41:44.335
All right, we've got to clear out.
Come on. Let's move. Come on.

41:44.418 --> 41:47.213
<i>Code silver. Code silver.</i>

41:47.296 --> 41:48.631
Hooch! What are you doing?

41:48.714 --> 41:50.424
There's a hit man,
and you're eating pudding now?

41:51.967 --> 41:53.260
Drop your weapon!

41:58.432 --> 42:02.645
- Hooch! <i>Packen</i>! Go get him! <i>Packen</i>!

42:02.728 --> 42:05.147
Chief, it's Turner.
Hit man's headed your way!

42:05.231 --> 42:07.900
All right, US Marshals. Everyone, go.

42:07.983 --> 42:11.237
Keep your head down,
and don't come out until I say so. Go, go.

42:11.320 --> 42:13.405
Sir. Sir! You need to go.

42:13.489 --> 42:15.908
I've waited six months for this procedure.

42:15.991 --> 42:18.244
Okay, we'll reschedule. Go, go.

42:18.327 --> 42:19.912
Take him. Take him.

42:19.995 --> 42:20.913
Oh!

42:44.520 --> 42:46.188
Aah!

42:46.272 --> 42:47.982
- Don't move.

42:49.650 --> 42:51.151
Hooch, stop! Off!

42:51.819 --> 42:53.571
- Stupid animal.
-<i>Platz</i>!

42:54.113 --> 42:56.740
Good boy, Hooch. Turn over.

43:00.286 --> 43:01.704
You're under arrest.

43:02.204 --> 43:03.956
Hooch. Hooch.

43:04.790 --> 43:09.128
All right, just this once.
Just this once. Good job, boy.

43:12.172 --> 43:13.465
Ugh.

43:14.466 --> 43:17.845
So you really think we should retrace
the investigation backwards?

43:17.928 --> 43:19.972
You didn't just want more ice cream?

43:20.055 --> 43:24.059
Mom, I know what I'm doing, okay?
Investigation is in my blood.

43:24.810 --> 43:27.438
Okay. I just-- You sure
Grandpa and you didn't go anywhere else?

43:27.521 --> 43:31.442
I mean, it just seems weird. If he was
looking for suspicious cars, there's--

43:31.525 --> 43:34.945
Just digging up worms,
fishing and cleaning the guts out of fish.

43:35.029 --> 43:37.364
Yeah. No, I got that part. Thanks, bud.

43:37.448 --> 43:39.408
And then we came here for ice cream.

43:41.368 --> 43:45.789
"Serving the entire community
seven days a week."

43:47.416 --> 43:49.668
Wait! The ice cream truck! It--

43:49.752 --> 43:51.253
Sells ice cream!

43:51.337 --> 43:52.338
Yes! But--

43:52.421 --> 43:54.840
- Okay, stay with me on this, bud.
-'Kay.

43:54.923 --> 43:57.343
Mayor Sutton said that Grandpa used
to see things in different ways,

43:57.426 --> 43:59.928
what else they could do
and what else they could be.

44:00.012 --> 44:02.348
The ice cream truck drives everywhere...

44:02.431 --> 44:03.932
And sees all the cars!

44:04.016 --> 44:05.267
Yes!

44:05.934 --> 44:08.062
Hi! Two Drumsticks, please.

44:08.145 --> 44:09.271
- Sure. Coming up.
- Thank you.

44:09.355 --> 44:13.734
Also, I'm Laura Turner,
and this is my son, Matthew.

44:13.817 --> 44:15.194
- Hi.
- Hi, Matthew.

44:15.277 --> 44:17.905
I believe you knew my father,
Scott Turner?

44:17.988 --> 44:20.616
That I did, young lady. Fine man.

44:21.408 --> 44:24.119
Do you mind if we ask you a few questions?

44:25.496 --> 44:28.415
Thanks for letting us come by.
You getting all settled in?

44:28.499 --> 44:30.834
Yeah. Things are getting back to normal.

44:31.418 --> 44:34.630
Anthony! Honey. Hooch is here to see you.

44:34.713 --> 44:36.632
The chief sends his thanks.

44:36.715 --> 44:39.968
Says it's the first time he ever caught
a guy using a six-year-old's drawing.

44:40.052 --> 44:44.139
Well, we have Hooch to thank.
You have quite the dog.

44:44.223 --> 44:45.683
Anthony's really gonna miss him.

44:46.350 --> 44:49.728
Hey, Anthony. I got someone
I want you to meet. Yeah?

44:49.812 --> 44:50.979
Hooch, lead the way.

44:53.399 --> 44:57.361
Hi! This is my brother. He works with me.

44:57.444 --> 44:59.571
I hear we have a lot in common.
What's your name?

44:59.655 --> 45:01.907
His name's Anthony.
He's not talking much lately.

45:01.990 --> 45:02.991
That's okay.

45:03.075 --> 45:04.868
I'm Curtis. With a "C."

45:04.952 --> 45:07.496
Someone called me Bertis yesterday...
Not my name.

45:07.579 --> 45:12.835
Yes. And Curtis, with a "C,"
and I have a surprise for you.

45:18.966 --> 45:21.552
Come on out. Come to Anthony.

45:21.635 --> 45:23.262
Oh, my goodness.

45:23.345 --> 45:26.181
This is your new dog.
They love each other.

45:26.890 --> 45:30.436
Hello. Oh, my goodness.

45:32.688 --> 45:36.191
- What do you think his name should be?
- Hooch Two!

45:36.275 --> 45:37.234
Oh!

45:56.503 --> 45:59.923
Scott! Anthony needs you
to teach Hooch Two how to bark.

46:08.932 --> 46:10.642
Kiss me.

46:14.271 --> 46:15.522
Good boy.
