WEBVTT

01:18.208 --> 01:20.375
What the hell is going on?

01:20.458 --> 01:22.291
It's past curfew
on a Wednesday night.

01:22.375 --> 01:24.291
Andy, you're in trouble.

01:44.375 --> 01:46.041
That is very funny.

01:48.500 --> 01:53.000
Andy, please, you guys all
have
to go to bed now, seriously.

02:03.417 --> 02:07.000
One more song
then lights out.

02:47.917 --> 02:50.667
Feels like we landed
in a foreign country.

02:50.750 --> 02:53.083
One of Philly's few
high
schools for the deaf.

02:53.166 --> 02:55.083
'Founded in 1872.'

02:55.166 --> 02:57.375
Shoved them out
in the boondocks.

02:57.458 --> 02:58.750
All that gesturing

02:58.834 --> 03:00.291
seems like they're fighting
all the time.

03:03.083 --> 03:04.500
That kid talking
about us?

03:06.166 --> 03:08.250
Yeah, he's pointing at
the donut on your chin.

03:11.625 --> 03:13.041
This place gives me
the creeps.

03:20.333 --> 03:21.417
Good morning, boss.

03:21.500 --> 03:22.667
Lil, Nick.

03:22.750 --> 03:24.333
What's up?

03:24.417 --> 03:26.250
December 18th, '06.

03:26.333 --> 03:28.917
Deaf student Andy Rierdan
went missing from home.

03:29.041 --> 03:30.667
School was closed
for Christmas break?

03:30.750 --> 03:32.458
Yeah. Initial theory
was a runaway.

03:32.542 --> 03:33.709
So what are we
doing here?

03:33.792 --> 03:35.417
Teacher was cleaning
things out

03:35.500 --> 03:37.583
found blood
traces on the piano
keys.

03:37.667 --> 03:39.333
Lab just
confirmed the
ID.

03:39.417 --> 03:40.625
Matches Andy's.

03:40.709 --> 03:43.125
You saying Andy
was killed here?

03:43.208 --> 03:45.041
Could have had a nosebleed
playing piano.

03:45.125 --> 03:46.583
Deaf kid playing the piano,
Nick?

03:46.667 --> 03:48.625
Spot of blood
ain't
conclusive, boss.

03:50.625 --> 03:51.834
James.

03:59.875 --> 04:03.000
- Conclusive enough for you?
- That ain't a nosebleed.

04:03.083 --> 04:06.166
Looks like our runaway
didn't
stray far from home.

04:06.250 --> 04:08.542
Killed in a place where no one
can hear you scream.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
I still can't believe this.

04:47.083 --> 04:48.417
I mean,
you haven't
found--

04:48.500 --> 04:50.792
We're searching the campus
for Andy's body.

04:50.875 --> 04:53.417
Many students stay on campus
over the Christmas break?

04:53.500 --> 04:54.750
Andy wasn't even
staying here.

04:54.834 --> 04:56.125
It doesn't
make sense.

04:56.208 --> 04:57.458
Yeah, but there were other
students around?

04:57.542 --> 04:59.208
You don't think
another student--

04:59.291 --> 05:02.583
We'll need the names of
everyone
who was on campus that week.

05:02.667 --> 05:04.375
Of course.

05:04.458 --> 05:06.208
Are the parents here?

05:06.291 --> 05:07.500
Yeah, they're
waiting in my
office.

05:07.583 --> 05:09.333
I understand
they're both, uh..

05:09.417 --> 05:11.458
Deaf.

05:11.542 --> 05:12.709
It's okay to use that word.

05:12.792 --> 05:14.375
I'm happy to
interpret for
you.

05:14.458 --> 05:16.917
- If you need me.
- Oh, yeah, we'll need you.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.291
Now, how's it work?

05:18.375 --> 05:20.542
Most of these kids'
parents deaf, too?

05:20.625 --> 05:22.291
No, Andy's are the exception.

05:22.375 --> 05:25.083
They're both deaf
and both deeply
caring.

05:25.166 --> 05:26.166
And the other parents?

05:26.250 --> 05:27.458
Most of the hearing parents

05:27.542 --> 05:28.917
of the students at our
school don't even
bother

05:29.000 --> 05:30.959
to learn
American sign
language.

05:31.041 --> 05:32.750
The school's a dump
site
for them.

05:35.458 --> 05:37.250
You been working here long?

05:37.333 --> 05:38.500
Twelve years.

05:38.583 --> 05:40.208
That's a long time.

05:40.291 --> 05:41.583
Every time I
wanna
quit I think

05:41.667 --> 05:43.375
about the parents
who already have.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.667
They're talking
about you again.

05:47.750 --> 05:48.917
What's that pointing sign?

05:49.000 --> 05:50.625
I keep seeing it
around here.

05:50.709 --> 05:52.583
It means murder.

05:52.667 --> 05:55.208
'They're saying that you two
are homicide detectives.'

05:55.291 --> 05:58.583
The finger
stands
for a knife.

05:58.667 --> 06:02.750
(Vivian)
'I have no idea who would
wanna hurt our son.'

06:02.834 --> 06:04.583
'We never thought
Andy ran away.'

06:04.667 --> 06:05.959
'The cops didn't
believe us.'

06:06.041 --> 06:09.166
'They thought that we
were deaf and dumb.'

06:09.250 --> 06:11.375
Sorry to hear that.

06:11.458 --> 06:14.125
We'll do our best
to find out what happened.

06:14.208 --> 06:17.000
And Andy ever get
into any trouble?

06:19.000 --> 06:22.542
No, he was a popular kid
who everyone liked.

06:22.625 --> 06:24.208
Andy was a proud..

06:30.041 --> 06:32.792
'He wants you to know
Andy was a proud member'

06:32.875 --> 06:33.917
'of the deaf community.'

06:34.000 --> 06:36.125
He was as good
as any hearing child.

06:36.208 --> 06:38.333
Well, wow long was
Andy enrolled here?

06:41.291 --> 06:43.125
'He lost his hearing
when he was seven'

06:43.208 --> 06:44.709
'after he became sick with..'

06:46.458 --> 06:48.750
'...spinal meningitis.'

06:48.834 --> 06:50.333
'But he never complained.'

06:50.417 --> 06:52.542
'He took to our world
wonderfully.'

06:54.041 --> 06:55.166
Our world?

06:55.250 --> 06:56.709
Over the years, the deaf
community has developed

06:56.792 --> 06:58.375
their own separate
culture.

06:58.458 --> 07:00.375
(Vera)
'You'd think they
wouldn't wanna be separate.'

07:01.583 --> 07:03.709
Well, if you have
your own language

07:03.792 --> 07:06.125
you feel comfortable
with your own.

07:06.208 --> 07:08.458
Well, that's just moving hands.

07:10.750 --> 07:14.083
ASL is a beautiful
emotive language.

07:14.166 --> 07:15.667
You should try learnin' it.

07:15.750 --> 07:19.750
Uh, about Andy, you know how
parents are.

07:19.834 --> 07:21.250
'Was he really
such a saint?'

07:21.333 --> 07:23.667
A saint? No, no.

07:23.750 --> 07:25.000
He was mischievous.

07:25.083 --> 07:27.875
He was kind of wild,
but he..

07:27.959 --> 07:29.792
...he was a great
kid at heart.

07:29.875 --> 07:32.125
He was a straight A student.

07:32.208 --> 07:34.000
They can read your lips,
by the way.

07:37.125 --> 07:40.041
Uh, sorry. Had to ask.

07:40.125 --> 07:42.875
Any idea what Andy was
doing back on campus?

07:44.709 --> 07:46.041
Who had access to that room?

07:47.208 --> 07:49.542
Well, that room hadn't
been used in years--

07:49.625 --> 07:51.583
Yeah, but someone must
have had a key.

07:51.667 --> 07:53.125
I did.

07:53.208 --> 07:54.792
And a month before
Andy disappeared

07:54.875 --> 07:56.375
I gave the key to someone.

07:59.834 --> 08:02.375
Did you finish
your college essay yet?

08:09.792 --> 08:11.500
No, I'm at that school.

08:11.583 --> 08:13.041
I started today, remember?

08:13.125 --> 08:14.709
...and party less.

08:14.792 --> 08:18.250
Yeah, kind of Dickens orphan
depressing.

08:18.333 --> 08:20.375
'Dickens was
a writer, daddy.'

08:20.458 --> 08:21.792
- Gotta go.
- Mornin', Emma.

08:23.333 --> 08:25.875
Emma will be volunteering
here for a month.

08:25.959 --> 08:27.375
Have you been playing long?

08:27.458 --> 08:28.875
I wouldn't call it playing.

08:28.959 --> 08:32.166
I just know some basics
from when I took lessons.

08:32.250 --> 08:34.041
Well, the kids will love it.

08:34.125 --> 08:37.291
'This is Andy and Carlos.'

08:37.375 --> 08:40.208
Hi. It's nice to meet you.

08:40.291 --> 08:43.333
This is such a nice place.

08:46.875 --> 08:49.917
I took a class for two years
for extra credit.

08:56.333 --> 08:59.834
Well, I thought some could,
you know

08:59.917 --> 09:01.917
feel the vibration.

09:07.709 --> 09:09.917
Andy!
What is wrong?

09:10.000 --> 09:11.208
She wants to help!

09:18.500 --> 09:20.291
- Andy!
- You don't know me.

09:28.125 --> 09:29.667
And you're the big shot
at a school

09:29.750 --> 09:32.583
where most of the kids graduate
with a fifth-grade education.

09:32.667 --> 09:34.375
- Emma!
- You're not disabled.

09:34.458 --> 09:36.458
You're pathetic.

09:36.542 --> 09:38.417
Sorry. Maybe this
isn't gonna work out.

09:42.375 --> 09:45.500
This Emma, the only one
with a key to the room?

09:45.583 --> 09:47.333
Yes, I gave her the key, yeah.

09:47.417 --> 09:49.458
Some fireworks,
but it seems like Emma quit

09:49.542 --> 09:50.583
long before Andy died.

09:50.667 --> 09:52.083
No, she couldn't quit.

09:52.166 --> 09:53.500
And why's that?

09:53.583 --> 09:55.959
Well, she wasn't here out
of the kindness of her heart.

09:57.208 --> 09:59.041
It was a court-ordered
community service.

09:59.125 --> 10:02.166
- What did she do?
- Uh, DUI.

10:02.250 --> 10:05.583
Emma was a very
complicated girl.

10:05.667 --> 10:09.000
But she stayed and she
actually
became a great teacher.

10:09.083 --> 10:11.542
- The kids liked her.
- But not Andy.

10:11.625 --> 10:12.875
No.

10:13.875 --> 10:15.000
Did you know Emma?

10:16.583 --> 10:19.375
'No. We never met.'

10:19.458 --> 10:22.500
'Andy, he only really
liked his own people.'

10:31.125 --> 10:33.625
You and Andy
didn't get
along.

10:33.709 --> 10:35.291
The security logs over
the Christmas break

10:35.375 --> 10:38.041
show you were at the school
the day Andy disappeared.

10:38.125 --> 10:39.625
You there
to see him?

10:39.709 --> 10:41.417
I went to grab
my laptop, okay?

10:41.500 --> 10:42.458
I didn't see Andy.

10:42.542 --> 10:43.750
Things get worse
between you two?

10:43.834 --> 10:45.125
Better, actually.

10:45.208 --> 10:47.458
Much as it hurt,
he had me down cold.

10:47.542 --> 10:50.750
Meaning you didn't give
a rat's ass about those
kids.

10:50.834 --> 10:52.917
All I cared about
was clearing my
record

10:53.000 --> 10:55.709
and getting accepted
at an Ivy League
school.

10:55.792 --> 10:58.291
- And you succeeded?
- On both counts.

10:58.375 --> 11:00.375
I'm sure you checked.

11:00.458 --> 11:02.208
So he was right about you.

11:02.291 --> 11:04.041
And I was wrong about him.

11:04.125 --> 11:05.542
I thought he was
just a party boy.

11:05.625 --> 11:07.458
Something change
between you two?

11:07.542 --> 11:08.667
Yeah.

11:08.750 --> 11:12.000
Two days after we
met,
he came to me.

11:23.083 --> 11:24.583
Not done
criticizing
me?

11:30.667 --> 11:31.917
It's okay.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.500
You were kinda
funny, too.

11:35.834 --> 11:37.375
And I was mean.

11:37.458 --> 11:39.375
You know why I'm
really here,
right?

11:55.792 --> 11:58.667
I had a huge
fight with my
dad.

11:58.750 --> 12:02.542
I was all sad
and weirded
out.

12:02.625 --> 12:05.291
I thought that drinking a
half
bottle of vodka would
help.

12:08.542 --> 12:11.709
I only got a B-plus
on an English paper.

12:20.750 --> 12:23.792
My dad's a third
generation
steelworker.

12:23.875 --> 12:26.750
He wants his
daughter
to do better.

12:26.834 --> 12:28.625
A lot better.

12:34.375 --> 12:37.834
The quiet is
so peaceful.

12:46.500 --> 12:48.750
Help me understand.

12:51.917 --> 12:55.333
You hear
with
your eyes?

13:21.792 --> 13:23.834
You wanna know what
my voice sounds
like?

13:25.625 --> 13:26.917
I don't know.

13:28.542 --> 13:29.834
It sounds like..

13:30.917 --> 13:32.166
...me.

14:15.500 --> 14:18.000
This Leah was
Andy's girlfriend?

14:18.083 --> 14:19.625
That's what she
thought, anyway.

14:19.709 --> 14:22.917
- She ever threaten Andy again?
- No.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.625
But she'd always be around.

14:25.709 --> 14:28.250
- It was kinda weird.
- "Fatal Attraction" weird?

14:28.333 --> 14:30.250
Andy told me sometimes
he'd see her standing

14:30.333 --> 14:34.000
out in the quad just staring
up
at his room for hours.

14:34.083 --> 14:35.333
What about you and Andy?

14:36.583 --> 14:37.792
You two hook up?

14:37.875 --> 14:40.875
For like two
seconds,
but I broke it off.

14:42.417 --> 14:43.959
Why?

14:44.041 --> 14:45.917
We were too..

14:46.000 --> 14:47.291
...different.

14:54.625 --> 14:55.917
Everything okay, Lil?

14:56.000 --> 14:57.250
Sure.

14:57.333 --> 14:58.959
Why not?

14:59.041 --> 15:00.166
Good.

15:00.250 --> 15:01.959
'Dean Harden finally
faxed over the list'

15:02.041 --> 15:04.291
of kids on campus
during Christmas
break.

15:04.375 --> 15:05.709
Leah O'Rafferty on it?

15:05.792 --> 15:08.125
Yup. And take a look
at her school
records.

15:09.709 --> 15:11.250
Huh.

15:11.333 --> 15:14.458
Suspended last year for
stalking her ex-boyfriend.

15:14.542 --> 15:16.208
Threw a rock through
his dorm window?

15:16.291 --> 15:18.834
While he was asleep.
Almost took out an
eye.

15:19.959 --> 15:21.750
A dangerous girl
to break up with.

15:27.709 --> 15:28.834
Yeah. Well, thanks.

15:30.250 --> 15:32.792
Still no luck finding
Andy's body near the campus.

15:32.875 --> 15:34.208
We got the dogs out?

15:34.291 --> 15:35.417
- The works.
- I've got something for you.

15:35.500 --> 15:36.917
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.625
You're real popular this
morning. It's a Jarrod Jones?

15:41.542 --> 15:43.458
Everything alright?

15:43.542 --> 15:44.834
Couldn't be better.

15:48.208 --> 15:49.291
You don't wanna know.

15:54.208 --> 15:55.500
Figure that might
help us understand

15:55.583 --> 15:56.750
who we're talking to
a little better.

15:56.834 --> 15:59.542
- Yeah. Learning any?
- Yeah. Um..

16:08.834 --> 16:11.417
- What does that mean?
- You're buying lunch.

16:11.500 --> 16:13.458
Really?

16:13.542 --> 16:14.875
Well, how do you sign

16:14.959 --> 16:17.458
You still owe me
50 bucks from poker?

16:17.542 --> 16:18.792
Oh. Uh..

16:19.375 --> 16:21.333
It's, uh..

16:24.625 --> 16:26.375
I always thought that
meant something else.

16:29.166 --> 16:30.959
Leah, I heard
you were jealous

16:31.041 --> 16:33.166
when Andy started
spending time with Emma.

16:39.709 --> 16:42.583
I can hear you.
I have a
cochlear.

16:42.667 --> 16:43.959
A cochlear?

16:44.041 --> 16:46.125
A cochlear implant.

16:46.208 --> 16:47.500
Show her, Leah.

16:50.041 --> 16:54.041
It's an outpatient surgery
that helps restore hearing.

16:54.125 --> 16:56.417
- It's a cure?
- Not exactly.

16:56.500 --> 16:58.083
Works different
for every candidate.

16:58.166 --> 17:00.291
I can hear a twig snap now.

17:02.166 --> 17:05.458
Leah, were you upset when
he broke it off with you?

17:07.250 --> 17:10.208
I wath..
I wath..

17:15.625 --> 17:17.750
(Vivian)
'I was mad at first, but..'

17:18.875 --> 17:20.667
...I could never
stay mad at Andy.

17:22.125 --> 17:23.625
Well, that's not what I heard.

17:24.709 --> 17:26.000
Don't lie to me, Leah.

17:27.875 --> 17:29.792
I'm not lying.

17:29.875 --> 17:31.500
'I wasn't mad.
I loved him.'

17:31.583 --> 17:33.750
But he tossed you aside.

17:33.834 --> 17:35.000
He used you.

17:35.083 --> 17:38.583
And you followed him.
Couldn't let it go.

17:43.250 --> 17:46.125
'I wasn't the only one
mad at Andy.'

18:26.583 --> 18:29.333
(male #1)
'Hey, kid!
Get outta the way!'

18:29.417 --> 18:31.250
'Hard to hear?'

18:31.333 --> 18:33.583
'Just came into
the street, you know..'

18:38.000 --> 18:42.208
'He was so interested
in the hearing world'

18:42.291 --> 18:44.458
I couldn't
compete, so..

18:44.542 --> 18:46.333
...I gave up.

18:46.417 --> 18:47.542
'It hurt.'

18:47.625 --> 18:50.291
Was Carlos still mad
at Andy before he died?

18:52.041 --> 18:53.166
'I think so.'

18:54.458 --> 18:55.792
'I mean, they weren't
hanging out much.'

18:55.875 --> 18:58.917
Do you think Carlos
might have hurt him?

18:59.000 --> 19:00.333
'He does have a bad temper.'

19:00.417 --> 19:01.542
And he's acted
so strange.

19:01.625 --> 19:03.375
He won't go near
Andy's old room.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.083
(Vera)
'Hi. Carlos.'

19:11.166 --> 19:14.875
I'm Detective Vera.

19:14.959 --> 19:17.458
This is Detective

19:17.542 --> 19:20.500
J-E-F-F-E..

19:20.583 --> 19:24.208
...R-I-E-S.

19:24.291 --> 19:28.583
Uh, we want to
talk
with you.

19:28.667 --> 19:31.625
"Your signing sucks.

19:31.709 --> 19:32.917
'I read lips good."'

19:33.000 --> 19:34.834
So you understand me?

19:34.917 --> 19:38.291
You have two assault charges
on your juvie record, Carlos.

19:38.375 --> 19:40.709
And we know you
and Andy got into a fight.

19:40.792 --> 19:42.959
You were on campus
the night he died.

19:45.917 --> 19:47.542
(Jefferies)
'"I never saw him."'

19:47.625 --> 19:50.083
Yeah, right.

19:50.166 --> 19:52.208
Did Leah say
I got into a
fight?

19:52.291 --> 19:54.000
It doesn't matter
who said it,
Carlos.

19:55.458 --> 19:57.500
"Leah's a freak
with an
implant."

19:59.208 --> 20:00.875
Admit it, Carlos,
you can't stand

20:00.959 --> 20:03.250
the fact that your best
friend
wanted the hearing chick.

20:10.709 --> 20:12.041
"Wrong about Emma."

21:03.125 --> 21:04.792
Why didn't you tell me
you could play?

21:08.959 --> 21:10.041
That was amazing.

21:16.750 --> 21:18.000
Where?

21:20.083 --> 21:22.166
Small concert halls?

21:22.250 --> 21:23.500
Wow.

21:23.583 --> 21:25.000
So you were a prodigy?

21:27.667 --> 21:29.750
Do you still..

21:31.375 --> 21:34.917
Well, Beethoven composed
when he was deaf.

21:39.583 --> 21:40.667
What are you playing?

21:47.583 --> 21:49.333
What do you mean by visual?

22:13.250 --> 22:15.125
No, it's beautiful.

22:16.291 --> 22:19.542
What chord do you hear
when you see me, Andy?

22:22.667 --> 22:24.375
Isn't there a way
for you to hear again?

22:24.458 --> 22:27.166
Have you thought about
getting a cochlear, Andy?

22:56.667 --> 22:58.625
- What the hell is going on?
- Dad.

22:58.709 --> 23:00.417
- Get away from her!
- 'You're hurting me, daddy!'

23:00.500 --> 23:02.417
Stay away from my daughter!

23:02.500 --> 23:05.208
You people need
to stay with your own!

23:05.291 --> 23:07.500
And I ever see you
near my daughter again

23:07.583 --> 23:09.542
I'll break
every finger you got.

23:09.625 --> 23:11.000
'Let's get out of here.'

23:15.875 --> 23:17.709
Her dad sounds
like a real nice guy.

23:17.792 --> 23:19.542
What was he doing there?

23:22.750 --> 23:25.792
"Emma lost license.
He drove her to school."

23:25.875 --> 23:27.792
Did Emma keep seeing Andy?

23:31.250 --> 23:33.500
Thank you for your time.

23:34.959 --> 23:37.458
Car...los.

23:40.458 --> 23:42.667
- "Your signing still
sucks."
- Whatever.

23:45.250 --> 23:47.333
It's beautiful how you're
bonding with the students.

23:47.417 --> 23:49.333
Deaf or not,
that kid's still a punk.

23:49.417 --> 23:51.458
Same thing Emma's dad
thought about Andy.

23:51.542 --> 23:54.000
Yeah. The question is,
was he willing to kill over
it?

24:01.417 --> 24:04.625
Didn't like your daughter
dating a freak did you, Al?

24:04.709 --> 24:06.625
(Miller)
'But Andy wasn't the kind
of guy who would back off.'

24:06.709 --> 24:08.125
You saw it yourself.

24:08.208 --> 24:12.250
So I killed a teenage boy
to keep him away? Come on.

24:12.333 --> 24:13.542
You did threaten him.

24:13.625 --> 24:16.333
Look, I'm sorry this
little crippled boy

24:16.417 --> 24:19.417
got killed, but he had
no business with my kid.

24:19.500 --> 24:22.166
- Because he was deaf.
- Hell, yeah.

24:22.250 --> 24:23.208
Emma has a bright future.

24:23.291 --> 24:24.625
If she stayed with that boy

24:24.709 --> 24:25.959
she'd have been a nurse
for life.

24:26.041 --> 24:27.375
But she saw him again, Al.

24:29.083 --> 24:31.458
Question is, did you?

24:33.834 --> 24:36.583
I was inspecting a site halfway
across the state that weekend.

24:36.667 --> 24:38.375
- 'Got records to back that
up?'
- Sure do.

24:38.458 --> 24:39.500
Good.

24:39.583 --> 24:41.542
Anyway, I went to
the dean to tell her

24:41.625 --> 24:44.542
to keep that boy
away from my daughter.

24:44.625 --> 24:45.709
I'll bet you did.

24:45.792 --> 24:47.750
Yeah, but she took his side.

24:47.834 --> 24:51.041
Told me Emma wasn't welcome
in the school.

24:51.125 --> 24:53.333
Are you saying
Vivian fired Emma?

24:53.417 --> 24:55.375
Bawled her out, more like.

24:55.458 --> 24:58.083
Said Emma had no right
being with Andy.

24:59.959 --> 25:01.667
Ask me, that dean..

25:03.166 --> 25:05.500
She had a thing for him.

25:05.583 --> 25:06.959
When was this?

25:07.041 --> 25:10.208
I don't know. Two days
before the Christmas break.

25:12.500 --> 25:15.709
So Emma didn't just leave,
you fired her.

25:15.792 --> 25:19.208
Well, that that type of
behavior
was completely inappropriate.

25:19.291 --> 25:22.375
Andy was a good-looking,
charming young man.

25:22.458 --> 25:24.208
Any of the teachers
have a crush on him?

25:24.291 --> 25:27.583
Anything...inappropriate?

25:27.667 --> 25:29.041
Of course not.

25:29.125 --> 25:31.125
He was a 17-year-old boy.

25:31.208 --> 25:32.375
What about you?

25:33.834 --> 25:35.125
That's absurd.

25:36.583 --> 25:37.792
I don't like being lied to,
Vivian.

25:37.875 --> 25:39.250
I'm not.

25:39.333 --> 25:42.500
The warrant on your computer
turned up an interesting
e-mail.

25:42.583 --> 25:44.208
(Rush)
'"Andy, we have to meet.'

25:44.291 --> 25:47.333
I think your parents know. V."

25:47.417 --> 25:49.333
Andy must have deleted his
back in the day.

25:49.417 --> 25:50.792
You saved yours.

25:50.875 --> 25:54.166
Now, what were you saying about
not having a crush on Andy?

25:54.250 --> 25:55.291
I swear--

25:55.375 --> 25:57.959
You and Andy
had a little tryst.

25:58.041 --> 25:59.208
Something go wrong?

26:01.583 --> 26:03.291
This wasn't about me and Andy.

26:03.375 --> 26:04.417
No?

26:05.667 --> 26:09.583
It was about Emma and Andy.

26:09.667 --> 26:10.959
He was making a big mistake.

26:11.041 --> 26:13.709
He was trying to be
a part of her world.

26:13.792 --> 26:16.625
And I went to his parents
to discuss it..

26:16.709 --> 26:18.792
We all wanna
understand what's going on.

28:04.166 --> 28:06.500
Andy realized that trying
to fit into her world

28:06.583 --> 28:08.875
would be a mistake.

28:08.959 --> 28:10.834
He knew he belonged
with his own.

28:15.917 --> 28:18.000
From your boy Jones again.

28:20.000 --> 28:24.625
This whole you're-out-sick
thing
is getting kind of old.

28:24.709 --> 28:26.250
Say I died, then.

28:26.333 --> 28:27.917
You know, it's none
of my business

28:28.000 --> 28:30.458
but maybe you should let this
guy meet his own daughter.

28:35.125 --> 28:36.792
You're right.

28:36.875 --> 28:38.291
It's none of your business.

28:43.875 --> 28:46.208
I've been spending a lot
of time with Toni's son.

28:47.792 --> 28:50.291
'Kid's taking to me.'

28:50.375 --> 28:52.291
Good for you.

28:52.375 --> 28:53.750
It's never
gonna be the same

28:53.834 --> 28:56.000
as having his real
father,
though.

28:56.083 --> 28:57.375
Not even close.

29:00.250 --> 29:02.959
So you're a parent
for five minutes

29:03.041 --> 29:04.458
now you're schooling me
how to do it?

29:04.542 --> 29:07.542
- That's not what I'm doing.
- You don't get it.

29:07.625 --> 29:11.875
I start telling her about
him,
I got to tell her about me.

29:13.125 --> 29:14.542
Who I was back then.

29:17.834 --> 29:19.500
So who were you back then?

29:21.166 --> 29:23.041
Someone I'm not now.

29:25.667 --> 29:30.000
Someone who would spend
one...reckless night

29:30.083 --> 29:31.709
with a Jarrod Jones.

29:34.125 --> 29:36.750
She finds out
who I really was..

29:38.417 --> 29:39.834
...it'll break her heart.

29:42.375 --> 29:43.834
No way that's gonna happen.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.625
(Valens)
'You were willing
to defy your dad'

29:52.709 --> 29:54.333
but Andy obeyed his.

29:57.709 --> 30:00.458
Come on, Emma, you
really just let it
go?

30:00.542 --> 30:02.834
I left school,
put the piano back in storage

30:02.917 --> 30:04.250
and didn't hear from him.

30:04.333 --> 30:06.542
Then you were home sick
with mono for a month.

30:06.625 --> 30:08.500
I was heartbroken
because Andy was gone.

30:08.583 --> 30:11.083
Or you were feeling bad
'cause you killed the guy

30:11.166 --> 30:12.208
'who broke your heart.'

30:12.291 --> 30:13.583
I would never hurt him.

30:13.667 --> 30:16.125
'Andy dumped you
for the deaf world.'

30:17.333 --> 30:19.291
'You admitted you..'

30:19.375 --> 30:21.583
'...you drink
when you get sad.'

30:23.583 --> 30:25.041
Lot of booze.

30:26.250 --> 30:29.166
You went back after
having a few and..

30:29.250 --> 30:31.125
...things got out
of control, right?

30:36.667 --> 30:38.417
Did you?

30:38.500 --> 30:41.291
[sighs]
But it wasn't what you think.

30:41.375 --> 30:42.583
Why don't you
enlighten me
then?

30:42.667 --> 30:44.000
'I didn't want
to tell you before'

30:44.083 --> 30:48.750
because even now,
if his parents knew the
truth..

30:50.000 --> 30:52.083
...it would break their hearts.

31:00.083 --> 31:03.083
Hey, you
didn't
text me back.

31:05.500 --> 31:06.583
Yeah.

31:06.667 --> 31:09.375
Last day of school.

31:09.458 --> 31:10.959
How'd your tests go?

31:13.583 --> 31:15.542
That's stupid
and you know
it.

31:19.208 --> 31:21.458
You're not gonna
get the implant?

31:23.709 --> 31:24.917
You used to hear.

31:28.208 --> 31:30.792
It's not about anyone
but you, and you know
it.

31:34.709 --> 31:36.125
You're scared.

31:36.208 --> 31:39.125
You're scared to hear
yourself play, aren't
you?

31:39.208 --> 31:41.291
'Cause what if
you're
not good anymore?

31:48.875 --> 31:51.166
Don't you want to
hear the snow
again?

31:54.125 --> 31:56.125
Andy?

31:56.208 --> 31:57.667
Don't you?

32:08.125 --> 32:09.625
Don't you wanna hear me?

32:16.959 --> 32:19.000
You gave him
the storage room
key.

32:19.083 --> 32:20.667
Thinking he got the implant?

32:20.750 --> 32:23.000
I don't know
if he ever found the courage
to.

32:23.083 --> 32:25.709
If he did,
sure would have pissed off
dad.

32:37.667 --> 32:39.208
We just found the body.

32:50.291 --> 32:51.583
(Rush)
Anything off the body?

32:51.667 --> 32:52.875
(Jefferies)
'Yeah, literally.'

32:52.959 --> 32:55.709
CSU found this near the skull.

32:55.792 --> 32:57.125
(Valens)
'It's a cochlear implant?'

32:57.208 --> 32:58.625
You got it.

32:58.709 --> 33:01.291
Looks like our boy
Andy found his
courage.

33:01.375 --> 33:04.125
Decided not to let his
parents
keep him down any longer.

33:04.208 --> 33:07.250
Andy turns his back
on his own people.

33:07.333 --> 33:09.291
It's the ultimate act
of betrayal.

33:15.375 --> 33:16.667
(Valens)
'Traced the serial number
of the cochlear'

33:16.750 --> 33:19.000
to a clinic in Manhattan.

33:19.083 --> 33:20.583
There's dad's signatures
on the release form.

33:20.667 --> 33:22.208
Well, it's got
to be a
forgery.

33:22.291 --> 33:23.667
Had the outpatient surgery

33:23.750 --> 33:26.500
for the implant December 18.

33:26.583 --> 33:27.834
Day he went missing.

33:27.917 --> 33:30.583
Goes back to school to
hide from his parents.

33:30.667 --> 33:32.291
Unless they found out.

33:32.375 --> 33:33.959
Maybe dad
was waiting for
him.

33:37.375 --> 33:40.709
You must have been upset when
you found Andy got an implant.

33:41.667 --> 33:43.333
He betrayed you.

33:43.417 --> 33:45.166
(Vera)
'Did you track him
down at school?'

33:50.166 --> 33:52.000
We think this is a forgery.

33:58.333 --> 33:59.417
"It has to be."

34:00.792 --> 34:02.667
When did you find out, Ed?

34:10.625 --> 34:11.709
Come on, Ed.

34:14.291 --> 34:15.709
(Vera)
'I know this is hard.'

34:30.959 --> 34:32.709
I signed it.

36:26.834 --> 36:28.250
So you let him go.

36:32.959 --> 36:35.125
(Miller)
'"I had to let my child
go.'

36:35.208 --> 36:37.083
Even if it meant losing him."

36:38.834 --> 36:40.959
So you knew he had
an implant all
along.

36:44.500 --> 36:47.792
You thought he'd wait till
after Christmas break to get
it?

36:55.083 --> 36:56.291
Thanks for your time.

37:06.333 --> 37:08.667
Are you talking about Carlos

37:08.750 --> 37:10.250
Andy's best friend?

37:11.333 --> 37:12.458
What about Carlos?

37:17.041 --> 37:18.750
(Vera)
'"Carlos talked him into
it?"'

37:20.542 --> 37:24.500
Are you saying Carlos wanted
Andy to get the implant?

37:24.583 --> 37:26.125
That doesn't make sense.

37:30.583 --> 37:32.125
(Miller)
'"Carlos went with him"'

37:37.583 --> 37:40.291
So Leah was a freak
for getting an implant?

37:42.834 --> 37:45.917
The same for Andy, right?

37:46.000 --> 37:47.583
(Vivian)
'I told him he shouldn't do
it.'

37:47.667 --> 37:50.250
Really? That's not what I heard.

37:52.083 --> 37:53.291
You went with him.

37:54.959 --> 37:56.792
Yeah, I did some digging,
Carlos.

37:58.834 --> 38:00.375
You got tested, too,
didn't you?

38:00.458 --> 38:02.834
W-w-wait,
there must be a mistake.

38:02.917 --> 38:05.500
Carlos is a well-adjusted
deaf young man.

38:05.583 --> 38:07.083
'When will you people learn?'

38:07.166 --> 38:10.333
People like Carlos don't need
to do anything to fit in..

38:17.542 --> 38:19.250
You wanna say
something, Carlos?

38:29.000 --> 38:30.375
"She doesn't know
what it's like

38:30.458 --> 38:32.834
to live in a world
where you're a freak."

38:32.917 --> 38:36.333
Carlos, no one thinks that.

38:40.333 --> 38:42.500
So you wanted
an implant, too.

38:47.125 --> 38:49.667
But you weren't a good
candidate because you were..

38:50.542 --> 38:52.917
...born deaf.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.875
'It must have hurt
to know Andy'

38:56.000 --> 38:58.083
was gonna leave you
behind in the..

38:58.166 --> 38:59.583
'for the hearing world.'

39:01.750 --> 39:03.625
Did you see him
at the school?

39:20.000 --> 39:22.166
- What's he saying?
- Please don't do this to
him.

39:22.250 --> 39:25.458
- Please.
- No, come on, Carlos.

39:25.542 --> 39:27.000
Andy was all you had.

39:27.083 --> 39:28.792
You were afraid
of-of being alone..

39:28.875 --> 39:30.709
No more best buds.

39:32.208 --> 39:33.834
Hey! Look at me.

39:33.917 --> 39:35.542
'Look at me.'

39:36.709 --> 39:39.208
I know you can read
my lips, Carlos.

39:46.125 --> 39:47.709
You found him, didn't you?

39:50.875 --> 39:52.458
'You saw him playing piano.'

39:54.792 --> 39:57.000
Right? Saw him hearing.

40:02.041 --> 40:03.500
How'd that make you feel?

40:05.166 --> 40:07.166
'Where'd that
leave you, Carlos?'

41:02.291 --> 41:03.458
Emma.
