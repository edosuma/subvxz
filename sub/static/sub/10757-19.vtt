WEBVTT

00:09.374 --> 00:11.365
- Frasier, Roz.
- Niles.

00:11.627 --> 00:15.063
- I'd join you but there's not a chair.
- I was just leaving.

00:15.380 --> 00:19.009
Niles, every time I give you my chair,
you wipe it off first.

00:19.343 --> 00:21.937
It's just insulting.

00:23.513 --> 00:26.550
For your information,
I was reaching for my cell phone.

00:28.393 --> 00:32.545
I'm sorry, Niles. I stepped out of line.
See you later, Frasier.

00:32.898 --> 00:33.887
Bye-bye, Roz.

00:36.568 --> 00:40.004
This is table seven. Could
you send someone to dust my chair?

00:40.322 --> 00:43.075
For God's sake, Niles. I'll do it.

00:43.367 --> 00:46.120
That's the most ridiculous thing
I've ever seen.

00:46.411 --> 00:48.402
Stop it. Just sit down.

00:51.542 --> 00:53.214
May I have one of those, please?

00:53.460 --> 00:57.453
So, I understand you had
a full dance card this weekend.

00:57.798 --> 01:01.234
I met a lovely young artist
at the gallery opening on Saturday.

01:01.552 --> 01:05.181
We went out for coffee afterwards
and our date lasted until, well,

01:05.513 --> 01:07.744
the cows didn't actually come home

01:08.016 --> 01:10.211
but I did hear mooing
on the front porch.

01:11.853 --> 01:15.562
I'm drawing a blank. The only woman
I remember you chatting with

01:15.899 --> 01:20.131
was the one in the Birkenstocks who went
on and on about her driftwood collages.

01:20.487 --> 01:22.842
Yes, that's Caitlin.

01:23.115 --> 01:25.106
We seem different on the surface

01:25.367 --> 01:28.962
but once you get to know her,
she is a breath of fresh air.

01:30.080 --> 01:33.152
I haven't felt this excited
about a relationship in ages.

01:33.458 --> 01:36.256
That's wonderful, Frasier.

01:36.879 --> 01:39.188
So, is she from around here?

01:39.464 --> 01:42.456
- It didn't come up.
- I see.

01:42.759 --> 01:45.796
- Where did she go to school?
- She didn't mention it.

01:49.057 --> 01:51.048
Probably art school.

01:51.310 --> 01:55.223
Being an artist, I'm sure she
is enthusiastic about the finer things.

01:55.564 --> 01:58.522
- Literature, music...
- We never got around to that.

01:58.817 --> 02:01.206
I think I'm putting you
on the spot here.

02:01.486 --> 02:05.638
Let's just leave it at congratulations
on your new relationship.

02:05.991 --> 02:07.265
What are you implying?

02:07.492 --> 02:11.167
I think we both know what kind
of relationship we're talking about.

02:11.496 --> 02:15.535
Would you stop saying the word
"relationship" that way?

02:15.876 --> 02:18.868
I'm not condemning you
for your little fling.

02:20.672 --> 02:22.788
Don't pass it off as something deeper.

02:23.050 --> 02:25.518
All you have in common
is the faint impression

02:25.802 --> 02:28.032
of the word "Sealy" on your backsides.

02:32.059 --> 02:35.734
I wouldn't stay in a relationship
if there was no future in it.

02:36.063 --> 02:40.261
So if you had nothing in common
beyond the physical, you'd break it off?

02:40.609 --> 02:43.282
Yes, absolutely.
It's a principle of mine.

02:43.570 --> 02:47.643
This topic comes up all the time
on my show. What do I always say?

02:47.991 --> 02:51.188
- Surely you must listen occasionally.
- Of course.

02:51.495 --> 02:53.884
But I'm usually busy
between eleven and one.

02:54.164 --> 02:56.314
My show is on from two to five.

03:00.420 --> 03:04.208
- Can't wait to see his face.
- Me, too. He doesn't have a clue.

03:04.550 --> 03:05.539
All set.

03:07.000 --> 03:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:20.566 --> 03:22.682
Let's do it together.

03:22.943 --> 03:24.296
Good boy.

03:25.404 --> 03:27.122
That was terrific.

03:28.282 --> 03:30.876
- I wonder if he made a wish.
- I know I did.

03:31.702 --> 03:33.181
- Niles.
- Hello, Frasier.

03:33.412 --> 03:36.370
Daphne, Dad.
We don't want to miss the previews.

03:36.665 --> 03:39.737
Come on, birthday boy.
I haven't given you your present.

03:40.043 --> 03:43.115
I got him a brand-new,
rubber eeseburger-chay.

03:45.632 --> 03:47.782
Frasier, can we convince you to join us?

03:48.051 --> 03:51.839
I don't think so. Your brother's
been slaving away in the kitchen.

03:52.180 --> 03:54.375
I'm having Caitlin over for dinner.

03:56.894 --> 03:58.486
For dinner.

04:02.232 --> 04:05.941
And what would
you be preparing for dinner?

04:08.614 --> 04:10.844
Stop your sniggering insinuations

04:11.116 --> 04:14.153
that Caitlin and l
share nothing but the physical.

04:14.453 --> 04:16.444
There are many things we share.

04:16.704 --> 04:17.694
Caitlin.

04:20.584 --> 04:22.814
Now they're sharing a Tic Tac.

04:24.796 --> 04:26.787
Let me take your coat.

04:27.049 --> 04:30.200
You remember Niles, of course.
And this is Daphne, Caitlin.

04:30.510 --> 04:32.501
We'll be out of your way in a minute.

04:32.763 --> 04:35.152
As soon as I can tear
Mr Crane away from Eddie.

04:35.432 --> 04:38.265
Yes, he's having a birthday party
for his dog.

04:38.560 --> 04:39.879
How old is he?

04:40.103 --> 04:42.742
Too old to be having a birthday party
for his dog.

04:43.774 --> 04:47.813
Can I interest you in a drink? I've just
opened a bottle of CÃ´te de Brouilly.

04:48.153 --> 04:52.465
You've been saving it. Bourgogne hasn't
made a decent Beaujolais in years.

04:52.824 --> 04:54.815
Do you hear that, Niles?

04:56.078 --> 04:58.592
Our Caitlin is a fellow oenophile.

04:58.872 --> 05:01.340
When I was little,
my father owned a vineyard.

05:01.625 --> 05:05.061
I would open a can of Hawaiian Punch
and let it breathe.

05:06.713 --> 05:09.671
And we share that same
quirky sense of humour.

05:09.967 --> 05:13.277
- Would you care for a glass?
- No. I hate the taste of wine.

05:13.595 --> 05:16.826
Finally. Something I can use
to tell you two apart.

05:21.103 --> 05:22.377
Martini?

05:22.604 --> 05:25.072
I cut out alcohol
along with processed sugar,

05:25.357 --> 05:28.713
dairy products and meat.
I hope I'm not screwing up your menu.

05:29.027 --> 05:32.064
- What are you serving?
- Well, so far...

05:32.364 --> 05:33.877
parsley

05:35.158 --> 05:38.070
and curvy orange slices.

05:38.745 --> 05:42.294
But we'll make do. Let me get you
a glass of mineral water.

05:42.624 --> 05:46.742
Please, help yourself
to the melon slices. Just...

05:48.005 --> 05:49.996
unwind the prosciutto.

05:51.550 --> 05:54.383
I owe you an apology.
You two are compatible.

05:54.678 --> 05:57.670
How long before
we're standing outside a wedding chapel

05:57.973 --> 06:00.931
pelting you both
with whole grain brown rice?

06:01.226 --> 06:03.694
Spare me your sarcasm.

06:03.979 --> 06:06.095
Let me have my fun. You're having yours.

06:06.356 --> 06:08.824
Even if you deny
that's what you're doing.

06:09.109 --> 06:10.827
I would never continue

06:11.069 --> 06:14.948
if I didn't feel that there was some
future in it. And I believe there is.

06:15.282 --> 06:17.318
Ever heard of opposites attracting?

06:17.576 --> 06:20.534
Where I am worldly,
Caitlin is unspoiled.

06:20.829 --> 06:23.946
Rather remarkable,
given her terror of preservatives.

06:25.250 --> 06:29.038
Frasier, I just met your dad.
Did you know we're both Libras?

06:29.379 --> 06:34.055
Which explains why I'm so perky,
open-minded and quick to tears.

06:36.053 --> 06:38.965
- And don't forget outgoing.
- No, I didn't.

06:39.264 --> 06:40.458
Everybody coming?

06:40.682 --> 06:44.800
- It was nice meeting you all.
- Nice to meet you, too, Caitlin.

06:45.145 --> 06:47.136
Will you stop smirking?

06:47.397 --> 06:49.752
It'll take more
than dabbling in astrology

06:50.025 --> 06:52.061
to dim the charm of this young woman.

06:52.319 --> 06:55.356
Oh, my God! This is the coolest chair.

06:58.075 --> 06:59.110
Just get out.

07:10.295 --> 07:13.844
- Morning, Frasier.
- Morning, Dad.

07:14.758 --> 07:16.430
What's the matter?

07:18.428 --> 07:19.827
It's Caitlin.

07:21.014 --> 07:22.333
I'm in hell.

07:24.101 --> 07:29.334
Last night I had the most intense
physical pleasure I've ever known.

07:29.731 --> 07:32.120
Frasier, before you continue,

07:33.402 --> 07:36.474
I shared my bed last night with a dog.

07:40.075 --> 07:42.430
That's not the problem, Dad.

07:42.703 --> 07:45.979
It's just there's absolutely no future
for me and Caitlin.

07:46.290 --> 07:49.088
I never thought there was.
She's a flake.

07:49.376 --> 07:51.367
That's not the point.

07:51.628 --> 07:54.938
There are aspects of her personality
that I find off-putting.

07:55.257 --> 07:57.248
Like her being a flake.

07:58.427 --> 08:02.136
It's just difficult to walk away
from something so intoxicating.

08:02.472 --> 08:04.906
Fras, I'm going to say one thing.

08:05.183 --> 08:09.335
Watch out for this woman.
I know how these things work.

08:09.688 --> 08:13.044
- You experienced something like this?
- I didn't say that.

08:13.358 --> 08:17.874
I just know the type. Today, she's got
you going against your better judgement.

08:18.238 --> 08:21.355
Pretty soon you'll be
thinking about her all the time,

08:21.658 --> 08:26.288
losing sleep, missing work,
neglecting your friends.

08:28.707 --> 08:33.940
And then you'll get caught naked with
her in the back seat of your squad car.

08:39.801 --> 08:43.510
But, anyway, the point is
the longer you put this off,

08:43.847 --> 08:46.042
the harder it'll be to end it.

08:47.684 --> 08:51.836
You're absolutely right, Dad.
Got to nip this thing in the bud.

08:52.189 --> 08:56.785
I'll go over there now. Doing anything
else would make me a hypocrite.

08:57.152 --> 09:02.067
Just yesterday I dedicated an entire
show to the importance of self-control.

09:02.449 --> 09:05.327
- You did?
- Doesn't anybody listen?

09:13.835 --> 09:15.905
- Who is it?
- It's Frasier.

09:16.171 --> 09:21.450
Why didn't you call first?
I'm working on one of my collages.

09:21.843 --> 09:26.553
I'm covered in paint. I got turpentine
in my hair. I'm all sweaty.

09:26.932 --> 09:30.686
It'll only take a moment.
I need to talk to you about something.

09:31.019 --> 09:33.658
All right, but be nice.

09:36.066 --> 09:38.022
Well, actually, I...

09:38.277 --> 09:40.268
Good Lord, you really do look...

09:41.905 --> 09:42.894
Good Lord.

09:52.040 --> 09:55.157
- Hey, Daphne, is Frasier here?
- No, he's not back yet.

09:55.460 --> 09:58.452
He was supposed to meet me
to finish this paperwork.

09:58.755 --> 10:00.746
Now he can just do it himself.

10:01.008 --> 10:04.398
- Can I use our powder room?
- Yeah, of course.

10:04.720 --> 10:08.349
Frasier's attempt to break up
with Caitlin has gone awry again.

10:08.682 --> 10:10.638
Now I've missed the wine tasting.

10:10.893 --> 10:14.249
What kind of weak-willed man
allows a woman to come between him

10:14.563 --> 10:17.396
- and a 1981 Cheval Blanc?
- Just out of curiosity,

10:17.691 --> 10:21.923
why didn't you go by yourself instead
of sitting with me for half an hour?

10:24.448 --> 10:27.042
I was worried about him, Daphne,
worried sick.

10:30.078 --> 10:33.434
Dr Crane.
Were you at Caitlin's all this time?

10:33.749 --> 10:37.628
Heavens, no,
I stopped by early this morning.

10:38.712 --> 10:41.510
We've decided to go our separate ways.

10:41.798 --> 10:45.552
And then I met up with Roz,
went over some paperwork.

10:45.886 --> 10:50.437
You know how she is. Get her on
one of her troubles and yak, yak, yak.

10:50.807 --> 10:53.275
And yet she makes
every story so interesting,

10:53.560 --> 10:55.790
I could listen to her for hours.

10:56.104 --> 10:58.299
Where have you been?

10:58.565 --> 11:03.081
Where do you think I've been?
Trying to break up with Caitlin.

11:03.445 --> 11:05.913
But did I do it? No.

11:06.657 --> 11:10.206
And why?
Because I'm Frasier and I'm a sexoholic.

11:19.795 --> 11:24.152
It's obvious what's happening here.
You are having a purely sexual fling

11:24.508 --> 11:27.181
that happens to all of us
at some time in our lives.

11:27.469 --> 11:31.018
Where the chemistry is perfect,
where you can't be alone together

11:31.348 --> 11:35.182
without tearing each other's clothes off
and jumping each other.

11:35.519 --> 11:37.510
Does this sound familiar?

11:38.522 --> 11:39.796
Yeah.

11:43.151 --> 11:46.621
Everyone's had a relationship like that.
I know I have.

11:46.947 --> 11:48.346
His name was...

11:49.616 --> 11:52.050
I can't tell you this.
It's too embarrassing.

11:52.327 --> 11:54.602
We're all friends here.

11:54.872 --> 11:57.511
I don't even remember all the details.

11:57.791 --> 11:59.429
Take a minute.

12:00.627 --> 12:06.065
It all started one afternoon when I was
sunbathing on the roof of our building.

12:06.466 --> 12:12.302
I was concerned about tan lines
so I decided to unhook my bikini top.

12:12.723 --> 12:14.395
I'll get it.

12:18.979 --> 12:24.531
Mine was this lifeguard. He had long,
blond hair and the bluest eyes.

12:24.943 --> 12:30.939
He used to get so sunburnt I'd spend
hours peeling the skin off his back.

12:31.909 --> 12:34.264
What was his name?

12:34.536 --> 12:37.130
Rick? Nick?
I know there was an ick sound.

12:37.414 --> 12:39.564
I was about to make one of those myself.

12:40.876 --> 12:44.232
My mother picks the worst times to call.
Did I miss anything?

12:44.546 --> 12:48.255
- No. You were telling us a story.
- Yeah, that's right.

12:48.592 --> 12:51.868
Well, once I got my top off,
I started thinking to myself,

12:52.179 --> 12:56.934
I've never had an all-over tan.
So I looked to see if I was still alone.

12:57.309 --> 12:59.300
Then I started to slip off...

12:59.561 --> 13:01.153
The rolls are done.

13:04.274 --> 13:06.834
We haven't heard anything from you,
Niles.

13:07.110 --> 13:10.546
I don't think we're exactly
in Niles' wheelhouse.

13:10.864 --> 13:12.343
I beg your pardon.

13:12.574 --> 13:15.611
I've heard your stories.
They're not the steamiest stuff.

13:15.911 --> 13:19.108
You've forgotten the semester
I spent living in Paris.

13:19.414 --> 13:21.723
I had a torrid affair
with a married woman.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.070
- Really?
- I had no idea.

13:24.336 --> 13:28.693
It's not something I boast about.
The attraction was simply overpowering.

13:29.049 --> 13:33.247
Every Thursday, two o'clock,
the Hotel de Boulogne.

13:33.595 --> 13:37.554
We'd arrive separately,
climb the stairs, open the door

13:37.891 --> 13:40.200
and ooh-la-la.

13:43.230 --> 13:45.425
What an embrace.

13:45.691 --> 13:47.602
Afterwards, she'd whisper to me,

13:47.859 --> 13:50.931
"There's something so sweet
in your eyes, and it..."

13:51.238 --> 13:54.389
"...does me so much good,"
said Emma Bovary.

13:57.870 --> 14:01.579
If you're going to steal a love life,
don't steal from the classics.

14:06.712 --> 14:09.101
The part about being in Paris is true.

14:09.923 --> 14:14.439
Got them out just in time. Another
minute and I would've had burnt buns.

14:14.803 --> 14:17.636
Which brings us back to your story.

14:17.931 --> 14:23.164
There I was wearing nothing but a smile
when the sun started to shift.

14:23.562 --> 14:27.635
So I moved behind the water tower,
and who was lying there but Derrick,

14:27.983 --> 14:30.781
the good-looking fireman
from across the hall

14:31.069 --> 14:35.347
who was also getting an all-over tan,
I might add. So I had two choices.

14:35.699 --> 14:38.418
I could either tiptoe away or...

14:38.994 --> 14:40.825
- Tea.
- No, sit!

14:41.079 --> 14:43.752
Must Daphne do everything around here?

14:45.125 --> 14:48.435
I'll get it. I could use
a glass of iced water anyway.

14:48.754 --> 14:52.030
You're not the only one.
Let me give you a hand.

14:52.341 --> 14:55.253
- Is any of this helping?
- Not much.

14:55.552 --> 14:59.306
I've got to make a point here.
For as long as I've known you,

14:59.640 --> 15:02.598
you've been complaining
about your lack of a sex life.

15:02.893 --> 15:06.408
Now you have one,
so why are you still complaining?

15:06.730 --> 15:10.200
It just seems wrong.
I've thought a lot about this...

15:10.525 --> 15:13.562
That's your problem.
You've thought too much about this.

15:13.862 --> 15:19.141
Why don't you stop listening to your
head and start listening to your body?

15:19.535 --> 15:23.164
You're enjoying this. Why
do you have to feel so guilty about it?

15:23.497 --> 15:25.772
I'm afraid I have no future with her.

15:26.041 --> 15:27.030
So?

15:28.293 --> 15:30.602
Maybe she thinks
she has a future with me.

15:30.879 --> 15:33.791
Then it would be wrong.
But is that how she feels?

15:34.091 --> 15:36.480
- I don't know.
- Ask her.

15:36.760 --> 15:39.228
If she feels the same way,
just enjoy yourself.

15:39.513 --> 15:43.825
These things don't come around very
often and they don't last when they do.

15:44.184 --> 15:48.655
You're right. Over-thinking things
can certainly spoil anything.

15:49.022 --> 15:52.856
I gave the same advice on my show
to that lawyer from Bainbridge.

15:53.193 --> 15:55.912
- I don't remember that.
- You were five feet away.

15:56.196 --> 15:57.834
Doesn't anyone listen?

15:58.073 --> 16:00.462
It wasn't until afterwards
that we realised

16:00.742 --> 16:04.291
we'd rolled onto the skylight
above the main stairwell.

16:08.208 --> 16:11.359
We took some ribbing about that.

16:37.487 --> 16:42.038
Everything's under control. Dinner
should be ready in about 20 minutes.

16:42.409 --> 16:45.606
- Smells wonderful.
- So do you.

16:45.913 --> 16:48.586
- Caitlin, you know...
- Yes?

16:49.833 --> 16:53.064
I wanted to ask you,
where do you see this going?

16:53.378 --> 16:55.892
Right now I'm heading
to your earlobe

16:56.173 --> 17:00.769
but if you care to reroute me,
I'm open to suggestions.

17:01.136 --> 17:05.015
No, I mean our relationship.
We've never talked about it.

17:06.849 --> 17:12.527
I don't know. I guess I was kind of
looking at this as a nice, casual thing.

17:12.940 --> 17:16.694
- I hope that doesn't disappoint you.
- No, I'm actually relieved.

17:17.027 --> 17:19.540
I've been loving things
the way they are, too.

17:19.820 --> 17:24.416
- We're just having some fun, right?
- Fun doesn't begin to describe it.

17:24.785 --> 17:27.583
I wanted to make sure
we were both on the same page.

17:27.871 --> 17:30.988
Is that what's been on your mind
because you've been tense.

17:31.291 --> 17:34.124
I even got some hot oil
to give you a massage.

17:34.419 --> 17:36.410
I guess we won't be needing that now.

17:36.672 --> 17:42.110
Well, I have been terribly worried
about this global warming situation.

17:42.511 --> 17:45.981
We've got some time before dinner.
I'll go get the oil.

17:47.182 --> 17:50.174
- I'm so glad we had this conversation.
- Yeah, me, too.

17:50.477 --> 17:54.595
I was starting to worry that
you were scared off by my lifestyle.

17:54.940 --> 17:58.535
- I mean, I'm pretty out there.
- Oh, Caitlin...

18:00.404 --> 18:03.794
I'm not that narrow-minded.
We have a wonderful chemistry.

18:04.116 --> 18:06.755
That's enough to offset
a few minor differences.

18:07.035 --> 18:09.424
You can be taking your shirt off.

18:11.039 --> 18:13.030
Same goes, by the way.

18:14.251 --> 18:17.129
I just love these converted loft spaces.

18:17.421 --> 18:20.538
I wonder what this one was
before you moved in.

18:20.841 --> 18:24.959
Judging by these meat hooks,
I'd say a slaughterhouse, huh?

18:25.304 --> 18:28.455
No, I put those in.
It was a day-care centre.

18:33.395 --> 18:37.513
You artists with your whimsical
decorating touches.

18:42.613 --> 18:44.604
That's a mousetrap, isn't it?

18:45.490 --> 18:49.563
- Do you get many mice?
- I wish. I use them in my art.

18:53.582 --> 18:55.140
Dead mice?

18:55.375 --> 19:00.324
They're part of my newest collage
series. It's all about mortality.

19:03.133 --> 19:05.567
Caitlin, you've cut your hair.

19:05.844 --> 19:09.314
Yeah, sometimes the spirit
just grabs me and I've got to do it.

19:09.640 --> 19:12.393
It's very freeing.
Plus, there's something great

19:12.684 --> 19:15.881
about using your body parts
for a practical use.

19:19.483 --> 19:21.474
Well, it's different.

19:21.735 --> 19:24.203
It's still beautiful, nonetheless.

19:24.488 --> 19:28.037
- Is that all your hair?
- It's mostly mine.

19:33.163 --> 19:37.600
- I'm thinking...
- No, don't think.

19:37.960 --> 19:42.715
The secret to a good massage
is to let the mind rest

19:43.090 --> 19:46.127
- and listen to the body.
- Right.

19:49.304 --> 19:52.262
Go ahead, body, I'm listening.

19:54.810 --> 19:57.005
That feels good.

19:57.271 --> 20:02.186
If we move to the bed, I could give you
a more thorough massage.

20:03.527 --> 20:06.087
I just remembered
it's a full moon tonight.

20:07.406 --> 20:09.840
Look. Isn't that beautiful?

20:10.117 --> 20:14.076
How romantic. There's nothing like
a full moon to make one want to...

20:21.378 --> 20:22.367
Caitlin?

20:22.588 --> 20:25.261
I'm a member of the Lycanthrope Society.

20:25.549 --> 20:29.337
- As in werewolf?
- Not literally. It's a group of women

20:29.678 --> 20:31.953
who believe the moon
controls our cycles.

20:32.222 --> 20:34.452
This is our way of paying our respects.

20:39.354 --> 20:41.424
Besides, you've heard me howl before.

20:41.690 --> 20:45.649
Yes, but in that context,
I took it as a compliment.

20:47.821 --> 20:53.453
Frasier, you're getting all tense again.
It's the hair pillows, isn't it?

20:53.869 --> 20:56.542
Yes, that...

20:56.830 --> 20:58.980
- Got one.
- Among other things.

21:00.834 --> 21:04.349
I'm starting to think
that maybe this isn't such a good idea.

21:04.671 --> 21:06.024
What do you mean?

21:06.256 --> 21:10.727
We're just so different. I'm basically
your stuffy, buttoned-down sort of guy.

21:11.094 --> 21:16.009
You're a free-spirited, mouse-painting,
moon-howling sort of girl.

21:17.976 --> 21:23.209
Is even the most satisfying sexual
relationship enough to bridge that gap?

21:23.607 --> 21:25.598
Well, I think so.

21:26.735 --> 21:28.851
What do you think?
