12:44.036 --> 12:46.503
[groaning]

12:46.538 --> 12:48.505
I'll go.

12:48.540 --> 12:50.040
No.

12:50.092 --> 12:52.542
Come on, what's the worst
Claire can do?

12:52.544 --> 12:54.878
Shoot me again?

12:56.632 --> 12:58.048
Look, just try to stay calm,
okay?

12:58.100 --> 12:59.516
I'll find someone
to send, don't worry.

12:59.551 --> 13:02.219
Who?
[panting]

13:02.221 --> 13:04.388
For a bounty like that,

13:04.440 --> 13:07.057
hell, I'd turn you in
myself.

13:08.777 --> 13:11.395
I'm available.

13:11.397 --> 13:12.396
Nice try.

13:12.398 --> 13:14.564
Negotiating's what I do.

13:14.616 --> 13:16.616
You said it yourself...

13:16.652 --> 13:18.735
you got no one else
to send.

13:22.958 --> 13:24.958
How do I know
you won't bolt?

13:24.993 --> 13:26.460
And go where?

13:26.495 --> 13:28.328
Everyone in the city
thinks I have a predilection

13:28.380 --> 13:30.080
for eight-ball sex.

13:30.082 --> 13:32.749
I'm a pariah, down here,
up there... doesn't matter.

13:32.751 --> 13:35.051
The fact is,
I'm probably safer with you

13:35.087 --> 13:38.555
than anywhere else in Vega.

13:38.590 --> 13:40.807
Come on, Zoe, look around.

13:40.843 --> 13:43.894
I've already given you
food, a place to hide.

13:43.929 --> 13:45.512
Frankly,
I think I'm the only one

13:45.564 --> 13:49.483
who's keeping
this little operation going.

13:49.518 --> 13:51.485
I just saved your life,
didn't I?

13:51.520 --> 13:53.186
Now, let me save his.

13:59.912 --> 14:01.111
Claire.

14:01.113 --> 14:03.330
We just got a message
from Zoe.

14:03.365 --> 14:04.614
She wants to negotiate.

14:04.616 --> 14:06.199
Any conditions?

14:06.251 --> 14:08.618
She wants to sit down
at a mutually agreed upon place

14:08.620 --> 14:10.704
and a few basic
medical supplies.

14:10.756 --> 14:12.122
Someone must have
been hurt.

14:12.174 --> 14:14.708
Zoe will send an emissary.

14:14.760 --> 14:15.842
So should you.

14:15.878 --> 14:17.210
I'm willing to go
on your behalf.

14:17.262 --> 14:18.795
No, it's too dangerous.

14:18.797 --> 14:20.046
Arika, you just got here.

14:20.098 --> 14:23.133
To help Claire
in any way possible.

14:23.135 --> 14:26.603
I put down two rebellions
in Helena.

14:26.638 --> 14:28.555
These radicals usually send
whichever lackey

14:28.607 --> 14:30.724
draws the shortest straw.

14:30.776 --> 14:32.642
I'll hear their demands

14:32.694 --> 14:36.146
and report back to you.

14:36.198 --> 14:37.280
Okay.

14:38.358 --> 14:41.651
Alex. Alex!

14:41.653 --> 14:44.070
You bring
this kind of carnage with you

14:44.122 --> 14:45.572
wherever you go?

14:45.624 --> 14:46.873
Where's Noma
and Riesen?

14:46.909 --> 14:50.160
I needed to talk to you.
Don't worry, they're fine.

14:50.162 --> 14:51.828
Now, my guards inform me

14:51.880 --> 14:53.747
that not one
but two archangels

14:53.799 --> 14:55.832
have found their way
into my city.

14:55.884 --> 14:59.336
That's a 25-year record
broken.

14:59.338 --> 15:00.504
Have you ever wondered

15:00.556 --> 15:03.807
why Michael hasn't just
killed Gabriel yet, hmm?

15:03.842 --> 15:07.477
Michael could end this war
right now if he wanted.

15:07.513 --> 15:09.513
But he won't.

15:09.515 --> 15:10.764
What are you talking
about?

15:10.816 --> 15:12.232
They're brothers, Alex.

15:12.267 --> 15:13.233
They're twins.

15:13.268 --> 15:15.101
God created them

15:15.153 --> 15:18.271
out of darkness
in the exact same moment.

15:18.323 --> 15:20.357
Can you imagine?

15:20.409 --> 15:22.025
[laughs]

15:22.027 --> 15:26.029
Even a dyad's bond is nothing
compared to theirs.

15:26.081 --> 15:28.782
Now, look, I know
you and Michael are close,

15:28.834 --> 15:32.869
and loyalty is an admirable
quality in a foot soldier.

15:32.921 --> 15:36.540
But you came here
to lead an army, win a war,

15:36.542 --> 15:38.708
and sacrifices
must be made, my friend.

15:38.760 --> 15:41.795
Now,
Michael trusts you.

15:41.847 --> 15:45.048
If you lure him
into the trap,

15:45.100 --> 15:47.350
Gabriel will follow.

15:47.386 --> 15:50.053
You can save Vega, Alex,

15:50.105 --> 15:52.355
but it comes at a price.

15:52.391 --> 15:56.059
You trap Michael,
you kill Gabriel,

15:56.061 --> 15:58.228
and you end this war.

16:01.733 --> 16:04.317
Or I could just kill you...

16:04.369 --> 16:07.571
right now.

16:07.623 --> 16:09.489
But you won't

16:09.541 --> 16:11.908
because you know I'm right.

16:11.960 --> 16:13.743
I've waited thousands
of years

16:13.795 --> 16:15.712
for this moment,

16:15.747 --> 16:20.000
and I can't live with myself
if Gabriel gets away.

16:21.199 --> 16:22.615
Can you?

16:48.918 --> 16:50.468
I've seen men
go to great lengths

16:50.503 --> 16:52.253
to get my attention
before, David,

16:52.255 --> 16:55.056
but this is extreme.

16:55.091 --> 16:56.557
Even for you.

17:02.349 --> 17:04.147
[rattling]

17:04.184 --> 17:06.150
The boy is dying, Arika.

17:06.185 --> 17:10.188
He needs a doctor,
not a fistful of vitamins.

17:10.240 --> 17:12.824
Antibiotics and painkillers
are in short supply.

17:12.858 --> 17:15.108
A doctor can be
arranged quickly

17:15.111 --> 17:18.913
when Zoe and her rebels
turn themselves in.

17:18.948 --> 17:23.117
Zoe sent me to arrange
a cease-fire, not a surrender.

17:23.118 --> 17:25.086
Excuse me, who are you?

17:25.121 --> 17:27.454
Zoe sent me
to keep an eye on him.

17:27.507 --> 17:28.873
A one-on-one negotiation.

17:28.925 --> 17:31.876
Those were the terms
we agreed upon.

17:31.928 --> 17:35.630
Let me know
when your people get serious.

17:35.682 --> 17:38.466
She won't talk
with you here.

17:38.468 --> 17:41.969
Do you want Jasper to die
because of you?

17:45.521 --> 17:47.521
I'll be right outside.

17:52.904 --> 17:56.039
Now, where were we?

17:58.121 --> 18:00.204
You have to get me
out of here.

18:00.240 --> 18:01.989
Tell Claire I'm willing to do
whatever it takes

18:02.042 --> 18:03.958
to get back to Whele Tower.

18:03.993 --> 18:05.993
David, you slept
with an eight-ball.

18:06.046 --> 18:07.495
We both know
that's bullshit.

18:07.547 --> 18:09.130
Claire just has to release
a statement exonerating...

18:09.165 --> 18:12.050
David, shut up.

18:12.085 --> 18:14.085
Tell me about Zoe.

18:14.137 --> 18:16.137
The crate, what's inside?

18:16.172 --> 18:18.256
C-4.

18:18.308 --> 18:21.843
Maybe a few hundred pounds.

18:21.895 --> 18:24.645
They stole a truck
this morning.

18:24.681 --> 18:26.931
Plan is to blow up
Caesars Palace

18:26.983 --> 18:29.600
and Claire with it.

18:29.652 --> 18:32.904
- When?
- Tomorrow morning.

18:32.939 --> 18:34.856
Convince Zoe
to turn herself in.

18:34.908 --> 18:37.075
There's not a lot of reasoning
with an anarchist.

18:37.110 --> 18:40.244
They want everything to go bad.
That's the whole point.

18:40.280 --> 18:41.579
Then you're going
to have to bring us

18:41.614 --> 18:44.115
the explosives yourself.

18:46.119 --> 18:48.453
You can't be serious.

18:48.505 --> 18:50.538
Claire needs
this little situation resolved,

18:50.590 --> 18:52.757
so she can focus
on the real war,

18:52.792 --> 18:56.127
the one outside Vega.

18:56.179 --> 18:57.628
Bring us that truck
in three hours,

18:57.680 --> 18:59.797
and we'll return the favor.

19:00.967 --> 19:04.552
What does that mean?

19:04.604 --> 19:06.554
A comfortable life.

19:06.606 --> 19:08.689
V-3 or above.

19:08.725 --> 19:11.776
Your reputation restored.

19:11.811 --> 19:14.228
How do I know Claire will keep
her end of the deal?

19:14.230 --> 19:16.397
You have three hours.

19:29.078 --> 19:31.379
Have you found the boy?

19:31.414 --> 19:34.715
Julian's not a human.
He's a dyad.

19:34.751 --> 19:36.634
Only disembodied higher angels
are powerful enough

19:36.669 --> 19:39.303
to form a dyad
with a human soul.

19:39.339 --> 19:42.807
All the more reason to bring
this city to its knees.

19:42.842 --> 19:44.308
Do it now.

19:44.344 --> 19:47.311
[alarm sounds]

19:47.347 --> 19:50.982
Once in a while, humans come up
with something quite clever.

19:51.017 --> 19:52.433
Military defense protocol

19:52.485 --> 19:54.519
designed to keep
the enemies out...

19:54.571 --> 19:56.521
or our enemies in.

19:56.573 --> 19:58.356
(woman) Lockdown activated
in ten minutes.

19:58.408 --> 19:59.657
Gabriel, no.

19:59.692 --> 20:01.075
We need to get Alex
out of here.

20:01.110 --> 20:04.078
I'll help you with Alex
once I lay waste to this city.

20:04.113 --> 20:05.997
Julian's been killing
our brothers and sisters

20:06.032 --> 20:09.283
for decades, Michael,
while we looked the other way.

20:09.285 --> 20:11.285
- Not anymore.
- It's too dangerous.

20:11.287 --> 20:13.421
Protect yourself.
Let me finish this.

20:13.456 --> 20:16.257
I ran from this city once.

20:16.292 --> 20:19.126
I won't do it again.

20:19.179 --> 20:23.097
[groaning]

20:23.132 --> 20:25.049
Your recklessness has got us
into trouble before.

20:25.101 --> 20:27.101
I can't take
that chance now.

20:27.136 --> 20:28.636
You'll heal in time,
but this is the only way

20:28.638 --> 20:31.222
to protect you from Julian
and Alex from you.

20:31.274 --> 20:34.141
I can't let either of you
be harmed.

20:34.143 --> 20:36.394
If you can't walk or run,
you can't be part of this.

20:36.446 --> 20:38.446
You can only fly,
away from here.

20:38.481 --> 20:40.648
Michael,
don't do this alone!

20:40.650 --> 20:41.816
[growls]

20:47.490 --> 20:49.490
I purged him to the V-1s
two days ago,

20:49.492 --> 20:52.326
and now he's speaking on behalf
of a V-1 rebellion?

20:52.328 --> 20:54.161
Gotta admit,
I'm kinda impressed.

20:54.214 --> 20:56.664
We all know David has
certain underhanded tendencies,

20:56.716 --> 20:59.500
but in this case,
he's right where we want him.

20:59.502 --> 21:03.170
(Claire) Yeah, but he's a politician,
not a secret agent.

21:03.223 --> 21:05.806
Do you really think he can
steal the explosives on his own?

21:05.842 --> 21:07.842
David's a man
who gets what he wants.

21:07.894 --> 21:09.510
And right now,
there's nothing he wants more

21:09.512 --> 21:11.312
than to be back up here with us.

21:11.347 --> 21:12.980
Oh, damn it.

21:13.016 --> 21:15.516
Our tail just lost David
in part of the northwest quad

21:15.568 --> 21:16.684
where the surveillance cameras
are down.

21:16.686 --> 21:18.019
They must have known.

21:18.021 --> 21:19.353
I mean, it narrows
the search, but...

21:19.405 --> 21:20.988
If Zoe detonates
that much C-4,

21:21.024 --> 21:22.189
how much damage
are we talking?

21:22.242 --> 21:23.858
Four or five city blocks
or more.

21:23.910 --> 21:25.743
We need to evacuate
right now.

21:25.778 --> 21:27.745
No, evacuation sends
the wrong message.

21:27.780 --> 21:29.280
Yes, "we want to live,"
which is a message

21:29.332 --> 21:30.531
I am perfectly okay with.

21:30.583 --> 21:31.866
(Claire)
I am not running away.

21:31.918 --> 21:33.534
Create a perimeter
ten blocks wide.

21:33.586 --> 21:36.704
I don't want any military trucks
near this hotel.

21:36.756 --> 21:39.373
If David delivers for us,
making him a V-1

21:39.375 --> 21:42.470
could actually turn out to be
the smartest move I ever made.

21:45.688 --> 21:48.072
[door opens and closes]

21:50.860 --> 21:51.942
This is it?

21:51.994 --> 21:53.861
Claire won't send a doctor

21:53.913 --> 21:57.148
unless you
turn yourself in.

21:57.183 --> 22:00.418
She put a soldier
on us too.

22:00.453 --> 22:01.702
We had to take
the crowded alley

22:01.754 --> 22:03.788
behind Circus Circus
to shake him.

22:05.508 --> 22:06.624
Sit.

22:06.626 --> 22:09.210
I thought we had
an understanding.

22:09.262 --> 22:11.846
Yeah, and I thought
you could get Jasper help.

22:11.881 --> 22:13.681
I guess we were both wrong.

22:16.853 --> 22:18.853
[grunts]

22:27.697 --> 22:29.396
(Zoe)
Radio me if you need to.

22:29.449 --> 22:30.815
(Jasper)
Zoe, what's going on?

22:30.817 --> 22:32.950
I need to talk
to our rebels in the Corps.

22:32.985 --> 22:34.735
I won't wait until morning.

22:34.787 --> 22:36.704
We're bombing Riesen Tower
tonight.

22:36.739 --> 22:40.241
Vega will change, and I'm gonna
make sure you live to see it.

22:40.293 --> 22:42.159
[door opens and closes]

22:50.136 --> 22:52.253
Always look
for the highest perch.

22:52.305 --> 22:53.754
High places keep you safe,

22:53.806 --> 22:55.840
allow you to see
what's coming.

22:55.842 --> 22:57.508
I wonder where
my dad is right now.

22:57.510 --> 22:58.893
All he left me
was a note.

22:58.928 --> 23:00.511
My own father disappeared.

23:00.563 --> 23:01.512
Did you leave you
a note?

23:01.564 --> 23:03.180
In a way.

23:03.182 --> 23:04.565
A message.

23:04.600 --> 23:06.600
But I can't read it.

23:09.105 --> 23:11.021
My dad has
bad handwriting too.

23:14.160 --> 23:15.693
Those boys
are gonna kill me.

23:15.745 --> 23:17.745
Only if you let them.

23:17.780 --> 23:19.246
They're bigger than me.

23:19.282 --> 23:22.283
I'd be dead
if you hadn't stopped them.

23:22.335 --> 23:23.868
This world is filled
with monsters

23:23.870 --> 23:27.288
far worse
than those boys, Alex.

23:27.340 --> 23:29.340
The blade I gave you...

23:33.763 --> 23:36.213
You must use it.

23:36.215 --> 23:38.933
We can't wait
for our fathers to return, Alex.

23:38.968 --> 23:42.469
We must fight our battles
on our own.

23:42.522 --> 23:44.388
Dad never taught me how.

23:44.390 --> 23:46.891

36:27.617 --> 36:29.784
(Julian)
Find Michael!

36:33.957 --> 36:36.123
These are beautiful.
Who drew them?

36:38.044 --> 36:40.127
An old friend.

36:40.129 --> 36:43.464
One foolishly obsessed
with the Chosen One.

36:43.466 --> 36:46.388
An old friend
or a dead one?

36:47.387 --> 36:50.187
A friend who outlived
her usefulness.

36:52.225 --> 36:55.810
You know I hate it
when you're cryptic.

36:55.812 --> 36:57.695
Please don't
treat me like

36:57.730 --> 37:00.064
I'm just another doctor
of Helena.

37:03.653 --> 37:06.654
I've always looked out for you,
haven't I?

37:08.658 --> 37:10.825
I appreciate
your protection,

37:10.877 --> 37:13.160
but I want
your trust, too.

37:13.162 --> 37:17.665
I know you didn't come
back to Vega to play mentor.

37:17.667 --> 37:19.000
I like Claire.

37:19.002 --> 37:21.335
She's a strong
and capable woman.

37:21.387 --> 37:24.005
Just the kind of leader
the Cradle needs.

37:24.057 --> 37:26.349
Shame we have to take
her city.

37:26.384 --> 37:28.342
Then what are
we waiting for?

37:28.344 --> 37:30.040
I should be cutting Claire's
throat, not caring for...

37:30.075 --> 37:33.230
Careful, Daria.

37:33.266 --> 37:37.018
Even doctors can outlive
their own usefulness.

37:38.855 --> 37:41.355
You only spent a few days
in Helena.

37:41.407 --> 37:43.324
It's worse
than you think.

37:43.359 --> 37:45.526
I've heard the reports.

37:45.578 --> 37:48.946
I know the storms
have worsened...

37:48.998 --> 37:52.833
Tiring our people...

37:52.869 --> 37:56.537
Weakening our defenses...

37:56.589 --> 38:00.174
Our city is running
out of time.

38:00.209 --> 38:03.544
Soon Helena's women
will need a new home.

38:03.546 --> 38:06.347
That's why we're here,

38:06.382 --> 38:09.383
but we must first
make room.

38:18.277 --> 38:21.278
[heavy breathing]

38:31.974 --> 38:33.270
I have to go.

38:33.305 --> 38:36.744
Why? Wh...
Where are you going?

38:36.746 --> 38:38.462
You can't just
leave me here.

38:38.498 --> 38:40.131
Trust your instincts.

38:40.166 --> 38:41.549
You will make
the right choice.

38:41.584 --> 38:43.000
I have faith in you,
Alex.

38:51.260 --> 38:53.260
What is it?

39:03.940 --> 39:06.941
What have I done, Nomes?

39:23.193 --> 39:25.643
Jasper!
Jasper, are you there?

39:25.679 --> 39:29.764
148, 149, 150.

39:29.816 --> 39:31.399
[grunting]

39:33.253 --> 39:35.019
(Zoe)
Jasper, do you read me?

39:37.691 --> 39:40.442
Relax, Zoe.
I'm here.

39:40.545 --> 39:41.973
Zoe, listen up.

39:42.123 --> 39:44.021
You got to
do exactly as I say.

39:44.067 --> 39:46.172
Get the V-1s
out of the tunnels, now.

39:46.305 --> 39:47.984
Get them to run.
Understand?

39:48.019 --> 39:49.334
What... Why?

39:49.369 --> 39:51.870
Because if there are any V-1s
left in the tunnels in...

39:51.922 --> 39:54.205
- How long do we have?
- Ten minutes.

39:54.257 --> 39:56.708
In ten minutes,
they're going to be dead.

39:56.760 --> 39:58.710
(Zoe)
Jasper, tell me what's going on.

39:58.762 --> 40:02.213
Do it, Zoe.
Please.

40:06.673 --> 40:07.946
All right.

40:12.726 --> 40:14.309
What can I do?
I'm here to help.

40:14.361 --> 40:15.477
Claire, I'm getting reports

40:15.529 --> 40:17.061
that V-1s are moving east

40:17.063 --> 40:19.731
out of the tunnels
and they're in a hurry.

40:19.733 --> 40:21.566
Those tunnels lead
all the way across Vega.

40:21.618 --> 40:23.284
That's thousands of people.

40:23.320 --> 40:27.655
[crowd screaming]

40:27.707 --> 40:30.325
[explosion]

40:30.377 --> 40:33.328
[explosions]

40:33.380 --> 40:36.714
Oh, holy shit.

40:36.750 --> 40:40.835
[booming]

40:41.507 --> 40:43.641
[electronic beeping]

40:45.892 --> 40:48.893
[chuckling]

40:50.259 --> 40:52.372
[booming]

40:52.407 --> 40:55.492
(Gates) The agri-tower's
on the other side.

40:55.527 --> 40:57.503
I think David
just stole our food.

40:57.538 --> 41:01.239
He did more than that.
He split the city in two.

41:01.274 --> 41:04.542
David Whele just started
a civil war.
