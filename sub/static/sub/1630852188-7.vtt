[Big Eatie groans]

01:18.286 --> 01:21.873
There was a bunch of BRADs.
We had to take cover.

01:21.956 --> 01:23.666
We lost sight of Kash.

01:24.542 --> 01:26.920
That means he could be in there
with Darius.

I'm the luckiest guy alive.

Another human. Finally, I'm saved!

01:44.103 --> 01:46.648
Okay, easy. Just back it up, kid,

01:46.731 --> 01:48.316
and answer my questions.

01:48.858 --> 01:52.570
Who are you
and how did you get on my island?

01:52.654 --> 01:53.738

01:53.822 --> 01:55.448
My name is Darius Bowman.

and I washed up here.

03:00.054 --> 03:02.056
[tense music]

03:03.224 --> 03:06.102
My dad and I were on vacation
when that Indominus thing escaped.

03:06.603 --> 03:10.106
We hid in these caves for a while,
so we missed the evacuation.

03:11.858 --> 03:15.862
After that, we had to fight
for our lives every day.

03:16.654 --> 03:18.114
My dad, he…

03:19.949 --> 03:21.159
He didn't make it.

03:22.160 --> 03:23.912
I've been on my own ever since.

03:24.746 --> 03:27.165
You expect me to believe that?

03:27.248 --> 03:28.416
It's the truth.

03:28.499 --> 03:31.336
Look, man,
if you let me call someone, anyone,

03:31.419 --> 03:34.380
I'm more than happy to get out of your way
and get the heck home.

03:34.464 --> 03:36.883
No can do. You've seen too much.

03:36.966 --> 03:38.676
So, you're stuck here.

04:06.996 --> 04:10.250
Okay, we are not trying that again.

04:10.333 --> 04:13.294
Oh, yeah, we are.
We're just gonna be smarter about it.

04:13.378 --> 04:14.837

[Kash] Let's say I buy
this story of yours.

04:24.264 --> 04:29.185
You're telling me you destroyed
an entire warehouse of BRADs on your own?

04:29.269 --> 04:31.562
The crazy robots
who kept trying to kill me?

04:31.646 --> 04:32.814
You bet I did.

04:32.897 --> 04:34.899
Took 'em out with one of those snow ATVs.

04:35.566 --> 04:36.484
Ka-ching!

04:41.447 --> 04:43.157
I've dealt with way worse than that.

04:59.716 --> 05:01.467
Super cool.

05:02.343 --> 05:04.887
Dinosaurs took everything from me.

05:04.971 --> 05:07.557
I'm all about watching them
go at each other for a change.

05:08.975 --> 05:10.727
It'll be over soon, though.

05:10.810 --> 05:14.314

What do you mean?

06:24.675 --> 06:27.303
Well, I figure making them
is crazy expensive,

06:27.386 --> 06:29.931
but if you lose one every fight,

06:30.014 --> 06:32.725
you either have a lot of 'em
or a ton of dough.

07:08.636 --> 07:10.805

07:10.888 --> 07:13.808
I guess the boss will be happier
if they can fight again.

07:13.891 --> 07:16.394
[Kash] Might already be too late
for the Kentrosaurus.

I'm Kash, by the way.

Look, kid, I got stuff to do,
and I'm not letting you out of my sight.

07:38.124 --> 07:41.502
[Kash] So, don't be annoying
and don't even think of trying to escape.

07:41.586 --> 07:44.005
The minute it's easier
to just feed you to a dinosaur,

07:44.088 --> 07:45.423
that's exactly what I'll do.

[laughs]

07:49.510 --> 07:52.555

[chuckles]

07:55.683 --> 07:57.685
At least he's alive?

For now.

[Big Eatie snores]

08:09.489 --> 08:11.741
Ever been this close
to one of these things?

08:13.075 --> 08:14.410
Closer.

08:14.494 --> 08:17.121
And when I was by myself on Nublar,

08:17.205 --> 08:20.124
I didn't have killer robots
to knock them out for me.

08:22.210 --> 08:23.878
Take us to the med bay.

[Brooklynn] No! Where is he taking Darius?

08:35.223 --> 08:36.807
Mae might know where they went.

08:41.938 --> 08:43.856
[Kash] It's just me and my BRADs for now,

08:43.940 --> 08:46.943
but when we're fully staffed,
it's gonna be so tight.

08:47.652 --> 08:48.819
[gasps]

08:48.903 --> 08:51.155
[tense music]

08:58.538 --> 09:00.748
Whoa! I was wondering
where those platforms went.

09:00.831 --> 09:02.583
You got a genetics lab down here too?

09:02.667 --> 09:06.462
So many questions. Too many questions.

09:07.547 --> 09:08.714
[rumbles]

09:09.715 --> 09:11.801
Hey, man. I'm looking out for me.

09:11.884 --> 09:13.553
If I'm stuck here, I just wanna know

09:13.636 --> 09:16.347
that you got this handled better
than those fools on Nublar.

09:16.931 --> 09:18.808
Once this place is up and running,

09:18.891 --> 09:21.561
it'll make Jurassic World
look like a cheap knockoff.

09:21.644 --> 09:24.647
[Kash] Dinosaurs are only here to fight
for the entertainment

09:24.730 --> 09:26.482
of serious high rollers.

09:33.197 --> 09:35.324
What's with the different terrains
and junk?

09:35.408 --> 09:37.243
Why watch dinos only fight in the jungle

09:37.326 --> 09:39.662
when you can also watch 'em
duke it out in the snow,

09:39.745 --> 09:41.747
or the desert, or somewhere else?

09:41.831 --> 09:44.542
If you can afford it, we can provide it.

09:44.625 --> 09:46.627
[foreboding music]

09:47.336 --> 09:50.006
[Mae] No!
[sighs]

09:50.089 --> 09:52.174
I'm sorry. This is just…

09:52.258 --> 09:55.928
Big Eatie's already been through so much,
and I practically raised Pierce.

09:56.012 --> 09:59.390
And now, Darius is stuck
with that monster.

09:59.473 --> 10:01.309
I get it, believe me.

10:01.392 --> 10:04.270
But they're tough, okay?
They'll get through this.

10:05.104 --> 10:06.772
There's an underground med bay.

10:06.856 --> 10:08.316
I didn't have access,

10:08.399 --> 10:10.443
probably because Kash
is doing horrible things

10:10.526 --> 10:12.236
he didn't want me to know about.

10:12.320 --> 10:16.115
And on top of everything else,
now he has my research.

10:16.949 --> 10:18.784
How could I have been so naive?

10:19.452 --> 10:20.870
We need another way to get in.

10:20.953 --> 10:24.165
Any of the feeding platforms
should get you down to the lower level.

10:24.248 --> 10:25.916
The next feeding is in the desert.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.294
With the saber-toothed tiger?

10:28.836 --> 10:30.838
So not "not dangerous".

10:33.007 --> 10:35.176
[pensive music]

10:39.305 --> 10:42.350
We go get Darius, no matter what.

[keyboard clacking]

10:49.440 --> 10:53.277
[door hissing, clanking]

10:53.361 --> 10:57.698
So, all these doors are, like,
rooms for injured dinosaurs?

10:57.782 --> 11:00.534
No, they're mega garages
for ginormous cars.

Yes, they're rooms. Stop talking.

are coming along just fine.

12:25.619 --> 12:27.788
Why is everyone waiting on me
to call the shots?

12:27.872 --> 12:31.083
Because I can't be the leader
and the heartthrob.

12:31.167 --> 12:33.127
It's just not fair to everyone else.

12:34.170 --> 12:36.547
I'm being serious.
What if I make a bad call?

12:36.630 --> 12:37.965
Oh, you will.

12:38.924 --> 12:41.594
[Kenji] But you'll also figure
a way out of it.

12:41.677 --> 12:43.679

what I needed to hear.

so surprised.

I'm just trying to help. Okay?

13:00.905 --> 13:02.239
-[grunts]
-[Big Eatie growls]

13:02.323 --> 13:03.616
[groans, gasps]

13:03.699 --> 13:05.784
[Kash] Yeah, that name's not great either.

13:07.161 --> 13:10.998
-[monitor beeping]
-[groaning]

13:28.057 --> 13:30.267
Just hear me out, <i>compadre.</i>

13:30.351 --> 13:33.604
Dino battles will make bank, for sure.

13:33.687 --> 13:35.981
[Kash's boss]
<i>Listen. This is extremely important.</i>

13:36.065 --> 13:38.776
<i>Do you understand exactly
what I need done?</i>

13:38.859 --> 13:41.946
But if you'll listen,
my idea could propel Mantah Corp.

13:42.029 --> 13:43.989
into the next stratosphere.

13:44.073 --> 13:46.450
[Kash's boss] <i>I am tired
of your interjections</i>

13:46.534 --> 13:47.910
<i>and your time-wasting.</i>

13:49.620 --> 13:51.539
[tense music]

13:51.622 --> 13:53.958
[Kash's boss] <i>…given you.
Do you understand that?</i>

13:54.041 --> 13:57.211
Yeah. Stick to the fights
and stop wasting time.

13:57.836 --> 13:59.880
Totally your call.
[grunts]

13:59.964 --> 14:00.839
[gasps]

14:02.883 --> 14:04.385
[Kash] We're doing another test.

14:04.468 --> 14:07.930
Put Asset 87 into the desert.
Monitor its stats.

14:08.013 --> 14:10.224
See how long it can last
in the heat or whatever.

14:11.183 --> 14:14.186
[in robotic voice]
<i>Unable to quantify "whatever".</i>

14:14.270 --> 14:18.148
Just do the stupid test.

14:18.232 --> 14:20.025
-[robotic footsteps]
-[gasps]

14:24.738 --> 14:26.824
[suspenseful music]

14:27.408 --> 14:28.492

14:29.910 --> 14:31.412
-[Kash screams]
-[shattering]

14:31.996 --> 14:35.708
No, Kash, stop wasting your time
on genius ideas.

14:35.791 --> 14:39.628
We'll just stick to the boring plan
like freaking simpletons.

14:39.712 --> 14:41.046
[Kash screaming]

14:41.130 --> 14:44.633
Why is that idiot in charge?

14:46.427 --> 14:47.428
[Darius yelps]

14:47.511 --> 14:49.013
[gasps]

14:49.096 --> 14:50.890
[breathing heavily]

14:50.973 --> 14:52.725
What are you looking at?

14:55.728 --> 14:56.770
[Sammy panting]

14:56.854 --> 14:59.023
Guys? I know we're in a desert,

14:59.106 --> 15:01.859
but it feels like
it got way hotter all of a sudden.

15:01.942 --> 15:06.739
So, how do we get onto the saber-tooth's
feeding platform without being dessert?

15:06.822 --> 15:08.574
We have to time it just right.

15:08.657 --> 15:11.452
We'll hide nearby,
and after the tiger eats and leaves,

15:11.535 --> 15:13.954
we jump on the platform
before it goes back down.

15:14.038 --> 15:15.372
Good plan, chief.

15:16.540 --> 15:18.542
[foreboding music]

15:20.502 --> 15:21.795
[Brooklynn] What is that?

15:23.130 --> 15:25.132
[tense music]

15:26.133 --> 15:27.468
[gasps]

15:27.551 --> 15:29.595
[deep growling]

15:30.888 --> 15:31.722
[roars]

15:31.805 --> 15:32.973
[Brooklynn] That's new.

15:33.974 --> 15:35.309
[all scream]

15:35.392 --> 15:36.226
[roaring]

15:36.310 --> 15:37.561
What is that thing?

15:37.645 --> 15:39.605
I didn't know they made 'em that big!

15:40.439 --> 15:42.858
[growling]

15:46.570 --> 15:48.447
Come on! In there!

15:50.407 --> 15:52.076
[all grunting]

15:52.743 --> 15:53.619

-[Kenji] Come on!
-[all whimper]

16:02.586 --> 16:04.213
[Sammy] It can't get to us in here.

16:05.631 --> 16:06.715
Right?

16:06.799 --> 16:09.802
It's too big to fit
through the entrance, but there's still--

16:09.885 --> 16:11.053
-[deep growl]
-[both gasp]

16:15.140 --> 16:18.268
[deep growl continues]

16:18.894 --> 16:20.229
This keeps getting better.

16:20.312 --> 16:21.230
Run!

16:24.441 --> 16:25.985
[snarls]

16:27.653 --> 16:28.696

16:40.040 --> 16:41.542
-[thuds]
-[groans]

16:43.752 --> 16:45.504
Any more ideas, chief?

[saber-toothed tiger cries]

17:08.193 --> 17:09.319
What?

17:10.029 --> 17:11.196
[roars]

17:11.280 --> 17:12.489
[all scream]

17:12.573 --> 17:13.824
Go around!

17:14.658 --> 17:16.243
[Asset 87 growling]

17:17.411 --> 17:18.620
[Brooklynn] Come on.

17:19.204 --> 17:20.789
[growling continues]

17:22.166 --> 17:25.711
[Brooklynn] Come on. We have to make it
to the platform before it lowers.

17:26.295 --> 17:30.507
You know, it'd be a lot easier
if I didn't have to tiptoe around you.

17:30.591 --> 17:32.801
I already have to do it
with my idiot boss.

17:32.885 --> 17:36.638
Yeah. If you ask me,
dude sounds like a total jerk.

17:36.722 --> 17:39.099
I didn't. But he is.

17:40.809 --> 17:44.271
I don't know what your idea is,
but he should listen to you.

17:44.354 --> 17:47.608
Sure, dino fights are cool, for a while.

17:47.691 --> 17:50.527
After that, it's gonna get lame.

17:53.489 --> 17:54.364
Exactly.

17:55.532 --> 17:57.576
Finally, someone gets it.

18:00.079 --> 18:01.538
[all panting]

18:09.171 --> 18:11.256
The next one won't be here for hours.

18:13.092 --> 18:14.551
-[grunts]
-[Kenji] Brooklynn!

18:18.806 --> 18:20.182
[Brooklynn] Come on! Hurry!

18:23.310 --> 18:24.394
[all grunting]

18:27.856 --> 18:29.149
[Darius] What are you looking for?

18:29.233 --> 18:31.902
Holler if you see a case
labeled "V-55 chips".

18:34.530 --> 18:35.948
I'll look over here.

18:36.657 --> 18:38.242
[Kash] Never mind, found it.

18:38.325 --> 18:39.535
[grumbles]

18:41.245 --> 18:42.621
Hold this.

18:44.581 --> 18:45.833
[chips clatter]

18:45.916 --> 18:46.959
[groans]

18:47.042 --> 18:48.335
Useless!

18:53.674 --> 18:55.759
[tense music]

19:01.056 --> 19:02.558
Anything else I can do to help?

19:02.641 --> 19:06.645
Unless you can reprogram a multi-core
processor in less than a week, no.

19:07.771 --> 19:09.356
Why do you need to do that?

19:09.439 --> 19:13.485
Some chick who used to work here came up
with a sort of dinosaur language.

19:13.569 --> 19:16.530
I figured, if they can understand
what I'm saying,

19:16.613 --> 19:19.950
what's to stop me
from making them do whatever I want?

19:20.033 --> 19:25.205
I'm talking completely
controlling dinosaurs.

19:25.289 --> 19:27.583
Imagine the kind of power you'd have

19:27.666 --> 19:30.878
if these stone-cold killers
did your bidding.

19:30.961 --> 19:34.214
No one is saying "no" to you ever again.

19:36.008 --> 19:37.509
Sick.

19:40.679 --> 19:41.513
[beeps]

19:41.597 --> 19:43.265
The med bay should be straight ahead.

19:46.143 --> 19:47.144
[chimes]

19:47.895 --> 19:49.813
I'm gonna be busy for the next few days,

19:49.897 --> 19:52.566
so if you stay out of the way
and don't distract me,

19:52.649 --> 19:54.359
you just might survive this.

19:54.443 --> 19:55.444
Sound good?

19:55.527 --> 19:57.237
Yeah. Real good.

19:58.447 --> 19:59.281
[beeps]

20:01.158 --> 20:02.409
[gasps]

20:03.952 --> 20:05.037
Hey!

20:05.120 --> 20:06.288
[beeping]

20:06.371 --> 20:07.915
[grunts, grumbles]

20:07.998 --> 20:10.250
-[Sammy] Darius!
-[Brooklynn] Oh, thank goodness!

20:10.334 --> 20:12.794
-[Yaz] Oh, you're okay.
-[Kenji] We were worried, dude.

20:12.878 --> 20:14.755
-[chuckles, gasps]
-[elevator dings]

20:17.883 --> 20:19.218
How'd you make it down here?

20:19.301 --> 20:22.221
Brooklynn. It was dicey for a minute,
but she got us out of it.

20:24.473 --> 20:25.557
What happened?

20:25.641 --> 20:30.270
I was about to stop the fight,
but the phone was right there.

20:31.355 --> 20:32.272
I'm sorry.

20:32.773 --> 20:34.942
I wanted to get us all home,
but Kash caught me,

20:35.025 --> 20:38.070
and now, we're still stuck,
and the dinosaurs are hurt real bad and--

20:38.153 --> 20:38.987
Darius.

20:39.071 --> 20:40.614
[sighs]
It's okay.

20:40.697 --> 20:42.324
You did what you thought was right.

20:42.407 --> 20:44.159
But it's like you said,

20:44.243 --> 20:46.954
we're the only ones
who can help the dinosaurs here.

20:47.037 --> 20:48.205
We have to stay.

20:49.998 --> 20:53.710
On that note, we should get out of here
before psycho killer comes back.

20:53.794 --> 20:54.795
Wait.

20:54.878 --> 20:57.839
Kash is planning on using Mae's language
to control the dinosaurs.

20:57.923 --> 20:59.424
-What?
-That's terrible.

20:59.508 --> 21:00.968
-How?
-Don't know,

21:01.051 --> 21:03.804
but it's got something to do
with these chips.

21:05.264 --> 21:07.224
Guys, I know it sounds nuts,

21:07.307 --> 21:10.435
but I think the only way to find out
how to stop this is if--

21:10.519 --> 21:11.645
You stay here.

21:12.229 --> 21:13.772
Serves me right.

21:14.481 --> 21:17.651
-The minute I get my hands on that kid…
-[elevator dings]

21:19.069 --> 21:20.237
[dinging continues]

21:22.322 --> 21:26.243
Look, if I run now, he'll hunt me down
and find the rest of you.

21:26.326 --> 21:28.036
But if I'm on the inside…

21:28.120 --> 21:30.205
You can find a way to get us information.

21:30.289 --> 21:33.250
Then, we can do whatever we can
to undo Kash's plans.

21:34.584 --> 21:36.378
It makes sense.

21:36.461 --> 21:38.005
Ah! It's crazy.

21:38.088 --> 21:40.257
He tried to kill Mae.
He'll do the same to you.

21:40.340 --> 21:42.175
He hasn't yet.

21:42.259 --> 21:44.553
No. No way. No way. We stick together.

21:44.636 --> 21:45.762
No one gets left behind.

21:45.846 --> 21:47.931
[Sammy] Guys, he's coming back.

21:48.015 --> 21:50.767
We have to decide, like, right now.

21:50.851 --> 21:53.395
[suspenseful music]

21:54.980 --> 21:57.816
You're toast, little man. I'm gonna…

22:00.569 --> 22:01.903
Saw this on the floor.

22:03.822 --> 22:05.449
[Darius] Thought you might need it.

22:18.045 --> 22:20.047
[somber music]

22:21.173 --> 22:23.175
[Brandon] I'm gonna find you,
little brother.

22:30.057 --> 22:32.476
[thrilling epic music]
