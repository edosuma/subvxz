00:02.001 --> 00:03.920
Previously on Lost:

00:04.003 --> 00:07.090
We were together for only one week.

00:07.174 --> 00:09.384
They came.

00:10.427 --> 00:13.012
They came and took her.

00:14.807 --> 00:16.641
Alex.

00:17.935 --> 00:19.686
They took my baby.

00:25.275 --> 00:28.111
Somebody please help me!

00:28.195 --> 00:31.447
He had this... this thing,
like... like a needle!

00:31.532 --> 00:34.200
He stabbed me with it!

00:34.284 --> 00:36.119
He was trying to hurt my baby!

00:37.121 --> 00:40.957
We got a problem. The manifest.
The names of everyone who survived.

00:41.041 --> 00:44.210
I interviewed everyone.
One of them isn't in the manifest.

00:44.294 --> 00:45.336
Hello there.

00:46.714 --> 00:48.464
Ethan.

00:52.761 --> 00:55.847
- I think they've been taken.
- Claire!

01:03.522 --> 01:07.900
I don't remember Ethan.
I don't remember what he did to me.

01:07.985 --> 01:09.694
Help me!

01:09.778 --> 01:13.406
Don't believe a word he says.
He's one of them.

01:13.490 --> 01:16.534
I have no idea what she's talking about.

01:16.618 --> 01:18.703
For a long time, he will lie.

01:19.621 --> 01:23.166
I don't know why you're asking me
these questions. This is a mistake.

01:24.668 --> 01:26.210
Tell me who you are!

01:26.295 --> 01:29.964
- What if he's telling the truth, John?
- What if he's not?

01:35.179 --> 01:36.971
Hey.

01:40.934 --> 01:42.935
Hey, it's OK, sweetie.

01:49.985 --> 01:51.986
Sweetie, it's all right.

01:55.824 --> 02:00.578
- John! John. Wake up.
- What... Claire? What?

02:00.662 --> 02:04.457
He's burning up,
and he's got a rash and...

02:04.541 --> 02:06.167
I need to find Jack.

02:06.251 --> 02:08.627
He's... He's on shift at the hatch.

02:11.131 --> 02:13.800
- OK.
- Uh. No, Claire, wait.

02:13.884 --> 02:17.136
- Claire, wait!
- No, I can't, John. The baby...

02:17.221 --> 02:21.474
No, no, you're not walking through
the jungle in the middle of the night.

02:21.558 --> 02:24.811
I'll go get Jack.
I'll send him right back here.

02:24.895 --> 02:26.979
- OK.
- Don't worry.

02:37.574 --> 02:39.283
Jack.

02:41.036 --> 02:43.830
- What's going on?
- The baby's got a fever.

02:45.457 --> 02:47.917
- A fever?
- Claire was coming here.

02:51.755 --> 02:54.757
- He asleep?
- Not a sound all night.

02:57.052 --> 02:59.387
I'll get back here as soon as I can.

03:14.444 --> 03:17.113
Hey, hey, sweetie.

03:17.197 --> 03:20.366
It's OK, it's OK.
Mummy's just gonna cool you down, OK?

03:20.450 --> 03:23.077
OK? Shh. It's OK.

03:24.329 --> 03:26.247
Jack?

03:28.041 --> 03:29.876
What are you doing here?

03:31.044 --> 03:35.047
- You stay away from us.
- He's infected, isn't he?

03:35.883 --> 03:37.341
What?

03:38.385 --> 03:43.931
- Your child. He's sick.
- Just get away. You get away from us!

03:46.476 --> 03:48.436
You don't remember, do you?

03:53.483 --> 03:57.153
It's a vaccine,
we don't want him to get sick.

03:58.488 --> 04:02.700
Hey, get back! Get away from her!
What do you think you're doing here?

04:02.784 --> 04:05.202
What are you doing here?

04:05.287 --> 04:07.288
Just get out of our camp!

04:15.505 --> 04:17.380
What happened?

04:19.843 --> 04:22.011
What did she say?

04:24.139 --> 04:26.724
She said there's
something wrong with him.

04:47.496 --> 04:51.207
It's just not like him.
He always sleeps through the night.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.960
- This rash... Something's wrong.
- Babies get sick.

04:54.044 --> 04:56.462
- What about the fever, cough...
- It's normal.

04:56.546 --> 04:59.840
- And he hasn't been eating at all...
- Claire. He's OK.

04:59.925 --> 05:01.509
It's probably roseola.

05:01.593 --> 05:04.220
It's a virus
that's common in children his age.

05:04.304 --> 05:08.099
- And the rash is a sign of it.
- OK. What if it's not?

05:08.183 --> 05:10.685
What if he caught something really bad?

05:11.687 --> 05:14.647
- Like some kind of infection?
- Infection?

05:14.731 --> 05:16.482
Where did you get that idea?

05:16.566 --> 05:18.567
Rousseau was here.

05:21.154 --> 05:24.490
- What did she say to you?
- She said she knew he was sick. OK?

05:24.574 --> 05:27.952
- That he's infected.
- Claire, there is no infection.

05:28.036 --> 05:31.163
We've been on this island for two months
and no one's gotten sick.

05:31.248 --> 05:35.001
Rousseau's crazy. We're gonna
let the fever just run its course.

05:35.085 --> 05:38.129
He's gonna be fine. OK? Trust me.

05:39.131 --> 05:41.048
I'm gonna get back to the hatch,

05:41.133 --> 05:44.635
but I'll come back in a couple hours
and check on him again, OK?

05:44.720 --> 05:46.595
- OK?
- Yeah.

05:54.479 --> 05:57.940
Hey. I'm sure that if there was
something wrong, Jack would know.

06:03.321 --> 06:06.323
Are you sure about this?
We don't really know her.

06:06.408 --> 06:08.409
I think she can help me.

06:10.328 --> 06:12.955
- Hey.
- Hey, guys.

06:13.040 --> 06:15.041
So, you're a shrink, right?

06:15.667 --> 06:20.713
I'm a clinical psychologist,
but "shrink" works, too.

06:20.797 --> 06:23.132
Can you help people remember things?

06:24.051 --> 06:26.844
I guess it depends
on what you need to remember.

06:29.139 --> 06:31.515
So, it was
our second week on the island.

06:31.600 --> 06:34.977
I was out in the jungle, and I...
I thought I was having the baby.

06:35.062 --> 06:39.065
Charlie was with me,
and there was this man, Ethan.

06:39.149 --> 06:43.027
We thought he was one of us
from the plane, but he wasn't.

06:43.111 --> 06:44.987
So, he took me. He took both of us.

06:45.072 --> 06:48.908
And I don't remember...
I don't remember anything.

06:48.992 --> 06:52.745
When Jack and I found Charlie,
he was hanging from a tree, by his neck.

06:52.829 --> 06:54.914
I have no idea what happened,

06:54.998 --> 06:57.917
and now I'm seeing these flashes
of things and...

06:58.001 --> 06:59.502
You know, I have amnesia.

06:59.586 --> 07:02.088
There's two weeks missing from my life.

07:02.172 --> 07:04.548
Claire, I don't think you have amnesia.

07:05.175 --> 07:07.551
Sometimes
when something terrible happens,

07:07.636 --> 07:10.054
there's a little switch in your head
that flicks on

07:10.138 --> 07:13.057
to protect us
from having to deal with it.

07:13.141 --> 07:15.684
Maybe your memories aren't gone.

07:15.769 --> 07:18.145
Maybe you're just blocking them.

07:21.608 --> 07:23.609
Then I need you to unblock them.

07:24.236 --> 07:27.321
Because my baby's sick,
and they did something to him.

07:41.920 --> 07:45.214
- Do you have to go to the bathroom?
- No.

07:45.298 --> 07:49.218
- Well, just let us know when you do.
- Yeah, I'll look forward to that.

07:54.099 --> 07:56.142
Thought you might like
something to read.

07:56.226 --> 07:58.060
Dostoyevsky.

07:58.979 --> 08:03.315
- You don't have any Stephen King?
- Mm-mm. Library's a little outdated.

08:03.400 --> 08:05.317
Right.

08:05.402 --> 08:07.069
Well, thanks.

08:12.576 --> 08:14.618
What's with the book?

08:15.453 --> 08:17.371
Just something to pass the time.

08:20.500 --> 08:24.336
Did you know that Hemingway
was jealous of Dostoyevsky?

08:25.255 --> 08:27.506
No, John, I didn't know that.

08:27.591 --> 08:29.967
He wanted to be
the world's greatest writer,

08:30.051 --> 08:32.428
but convinced himself
that he could never get out

08:32.511 --> 08:34.388
from under Dostoyevsky's shadow.

08:34.472 --> 08:37.015
Kind of sad, really.

08:37.100 --> 08:39.559
What are we doing, Jack?

08:39.644 --> 08:43.022
- What are we doing?
- We can't hide him down here forever.

08:43.106 --> 08:45.608
Changing shifts will
get people asking questions.

08:45.692 --> 08:48.611
I just want to know
what the long-term plan is.

08:50.071 --> 08:52.531
Well, John, let me ask you this:

08:52.616 --> 08:54.909
we don't have a long-term plan
for the button,

08:54.993 --> 08:57.286
but we keep pushing it, don't we?

08:59.915 --> 09:04.501
Look, until we know who he is,
whether or not he's telling the truth,

09:04.586 --> 09:06.837
we have to keep doing what we're doing.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.465
If you've a better idea, let's hear it.

09:09.549 --> 09:12.009
How about you let me go?

09:20.310 --> 09:24.188
Now we're away
from all the noises of the camp.

09:25.232 --> 09:27.066
Just breathe.

09:27.150 --> 09:29.693
Let your whole body relax.

09:31.071 --> 09:33.489
Good. Listen to the waves.

09:38.745 --> 09:40.162
Good. In...

09:41.831 --> 09:44.667
...and out, slowly.

09:44.751 --> 09:46.126
Good.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.755
Keep your eyes closed.

09:52.092 --> 09:54.176
Very relaxed, Claire.

09:55.512 --> 09:57.596
Just keep breathing.

09:57.681 --> 10:02.434
Now, I want you to visualize yourself
when you were pregnant.

10:03.728 --> 10:05.688
Keep listening to my voice.

10:07.357 --> 10:09.608
Think about what you see.

10:16.992 --> 10:20.244
We don't want him to get sick.

10:23.039 --> 10:25.374
When was your last checkup, Claire?

10:25.458 --> 10:28.836
Oh, I haven't been in a while.

10:28.920 --> 10:30.921
I've been busy.

10:31.006 --> 10:33.966
- I'm going to Los Angeles.
- Really?

10:34.050 --> 10:36.302
- Yeah.
- Traveling in your third trimester,

10:36.386 --> 10:40.139
- that's not usually recommended.
- Well, there's a family there.

10:40.223 --> 10:43.934
I'm, uh,
giving the baby up for adoption.

10:44.019 --> 10:46.395
Oh. Of course. I understand.

10:48.732 --> 10:50.983
The sedative I gave you was very mild.

10:51.067 --> 10:53.694
I know these exams
can be very stressful.

10:55.280 --> 10:57.614
I'm going to give you a shot now,
Claire.

11:00.910 --> 11:02.911
A little medicine for your baby.

11:14.299 --> 11:18.469
Don't worry,
you're just gonna feel a little pinch.

11:24.100 --> 11:26.018
It's OK!

11:26.102 --> 11:28.604
It's OK, it's OK.

11:28.688 --> 11:31.106
It was Ethan! I saw Ethan!

11:31.191 --> 11:33.400
I saw him! It was Ethan!

11:37.113 --> 11:38.280
It's OK.

11:38.365 --> 11:39.698
- No!
- You're all right.

11:39.783 --> 11:42.159
No! I'm not all right!
It was Ethan!

11:42.243 --> 11:45.204
- What happened? What did you do?
- Nothing! She...

11:45.288 --> 11:48.874
- Do it again. Do it again!
- No, Claire, you were screaming.

11:48.958 --> 11:50.667
But I remembered! OK?

11:50.752 --> 11:54.004
I saw Ethan. He was there
and he was giving me an exam.

11:54.089 --> 11:57.549
What you saw could be combining
experiences from before the crash

11:57.634 --> 12:01.220
- to things that happened to you here.
- No! No! This was real. OK?

12:01.304 --> 12:03.555
I was drugged.

12:03.640 --> 12:05.891
- They did something to me.
- Calm down.

12:05.975 --> 12:09.186
- It's not good for Aaron...
- You know what? Aaron is sick.

12:09.270 --> 12:11.605
I need to find that place, that room.

12:11.689 --> 12:13.899
It's real. It's real. OK?

12:13.983 --> 12:17.069
And there's medicine there for the baby.

12:17.153 --> 12:19.196
I need to find it. I need to find it.

12:22.492 --> 12:26.286
Kate, please help me find it.

12:53.773 --> 13:01.738
Hello?

13:02.699 --> 13:03.866
What's the...

13:06.244 --> 13:08.454
Hello?

13:08.538 --> 13:10.247
Howdy.

13:10.331 --> 13:11.999
Hello, John.

13:12.792 --> 13:15.627
- You are alone?
- Not anymore.

13:15.712 --> 13:18.255
- How many...
- Shut up.

13:20.550 --> 13:22.634
I was hoping to borrow a saw.

13:24.888 --> 13:27.097
Absolutely. Right this way.

13:42.322 --> 13:45.032
I need a gun,
and you don't get to ask why.

13:46.075 --> 13:50.787
Well, Thelma, seeing as
I got all the guns, I do get to ask why.

13:50.872 --> 13:53.749
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.335
Watch.

13:57.378 --> 14:00.506
- Why?
- Just give me a gun, Sawyer.

14:02.133 --> 14:06.637
Check it out. Found a new pair of
glasses, damn near my prescription.

14:06.721 --> 14:08.388
You like 'em?

14:11.184 --> 14:15.020
All right, I'm going into the jungle
to track down Rousseau.

14:15.104 --> 14:17.689
The French chick? What for?

14:17.774 --> 14:21.193
Claire thinks she knows where
there might be some medicine.

14:21.277 --> 14:22.903
The baby's sick.

14:22.987 --> 14:26.448
- Well, hell, I got medicine.
- She thinks he's really sick.

14:26.533 --> 14:28.534
As in "quarantine" sick.

14:30.620 --> 14:33.914
- What do you think?
- I think she's a little too worried.

14:34.999 --> 14:38.126
But she's going after Rousseau
with or without me.

14:38.211 --> 14:40.003
No boys allowed, huh?

14:46.928 --> 14:50.097
All right, what do you want?
Nine millimeter or rifle?

14:56.854 --> 15:00.774
I don't think this is a good idea.
Maybe you should listen to Jack.

15:00.858 --> 15:04.236
What if Jack's wrong? He said
the fever would break, and it hasn't.

15:04.320 --> 15:07.239
- He's getting worse.
- Just because it hasn't broken...

15:07.323 --> 15:09.658
How long am I supposed to wait, Sun?

15:13.079 --> 15:14.997
A mother should not leave her child.

15:18.209 --> 15:19.918
I'm sorry, are you a mother?

15:21.629 --> 15:23.005
No.

15:24.007 --> 15:25.549
I'm not.

15:28.886 --> 15:31.555
Claire,
are you sure you want to do this?

15:35.727 --> 15:39.354
- What did you say?
- Are you sure you want to do this?

15:41.190 --> 15:45.110
- You need to be sure.
- You have to get out of here.

15:52.368 --> 15:54.745
Do you have to put that in my tummy?

15:54.829 --> 15:57.247
It really, really hurts.

15:57.332 --> 15:59.333
I know.

15:59.417 --> 16:01.710
I wish there was another way...

16:02.795 --> 16:05.547
...but the baby needs it, Claire, OK?

16:07.717 --> 16:09.217
OK.

16:20.063 --> 16:22.481
There. All done.

16:22.565 --> 16:24.566
That wasn't so bad, was it?

16:26.277 --> 16:27.611
No.

16:28.404 --> 16:31.365
And now,
because you've been such a good girl,

16:31.449 --> 16:33.450
I think it's time for a surprise.

16:53.262 --> 16:55.597
Claire, this way, here we go.

16:56.140 --> 16:57.808
Over here.

17:05.023 --> 17:08.151
What is this place?

17:08.236 --> 17:10.028
It's for your baby, Claire.

17:10.113 --> 17:12.030
Oh, it's amazing.

17:20.790 --> 17:23.208
What happened to Charlie?

17:23.291 --> 17:27.212
Charlie? Oh, he's fine. When we got far
enough from camp, I let him go back.

17:28.756 --> 17:29.965
Oh.

17:30.717 --> 17:33.051
So, where did it all come from?

17:33.136 --> 17:35.887
I'd love to explain
everything to you, Claire,

17:35.972 --> 17:39.141
but I'm afraid it would be
a little overwhelming right now.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.318
Go ahead. Turn it on.

18:05.835 --> 18:09.004
- Ethan!
- Wait here, I'll be right back.

18:11.007 --> 18:12.424
OK.

18:17.013 --> 18:18.722
What the hell happened?

18:18.806 --> 18:22.434
You were supposed to make the list
and then bring her in. Was I unclear?

18:22.518 --> 18:23.894
It's not my fault.

18:23.978 --> 18:26.563
They knew I wasn't on the plane.
They had a manifest.

18:26.647 --> 18:28.857
Well, what am I supposed to tell him?

18:29.776 --> 18:34.070
Do you know what he's going to do
when he finds out? Damn it, Ethan.

18:41.537 --> 18:44.581
Get out. Get out of here.

18:48.586 --> 18:50.212
Claire?

18:51.380 --> 18:54.216
Claire? Are you all right?

18:56.052 --> 18:57.511
I...

19:03.059 --> 19:04.893
Ready to go?

19:08.231 --> 19:09.481
Sweetheart, shh.

19:09.565 --> 19:12.234
Mummy's gotta go now, sweetheart, OK?

19:12.318 --> 19:15.237
Don't cry, don't cry, it's OK.

19:15.321 --> 19:19.241
I'll be back really soon and I'll make
you feel all better, OK? I promise.

19:25.248 --> 19:27.541
- Thanks.
- OK.

19:37.176 --> 19:39.177
- You OK?
- Yeah.

19:47.019 --> 19:49.729
You're sure this is her trail?

19:49.814 --> 19:53.608
We started at the exact spot
where we chased her off the beach.

19:53.693 --> 19:57.028
- So, what do you know about Rousseau?
- Not much.

19:57.113 --> 20:00.031
You spent time with her
when you went to the Black Rock.

20:00.116 --> 20:02.325
You must have talked about something.

20:02.410 --> 20:07.247
Just about her ship crashing here
and her research team getting stranded.

20:07.331 --> 20:09.416
What happened to them?

20:10.793 --> 20:12.460
They died.

20:13.379 --> 20:15.005
How?

20:15.965 --> 20:20.302
- Tracks are gone. Trail ends here.
- Kate, how did they die?

20:22.263 --> 20:25.390
- She killed them.
- What?

20:25.474 --> 20:28.310
- Why would she...
- Because they were infected.

20:32.648 --> 20:34.399
You believe me now, don't you?

20:34.483 --> 20:36.985
I want you to take me back there.

20:38.195 --> 20:39.905
- Back?
- To where I scratched you.

20:39.989 --> 20:43.033
- Claire...
- No, OK, she knows I remember.

20:43.117 --> 20:44.743
OK, I remember a lot of it now.

20:44.827 --> 20:50.415
I remember the room,
the medicine, a teenage girl...

20:50.499 --> 20:54.377
OK? So don't lie to me and make out
you don't know what I'm talking about.

20:54.462 --> 20:57.756
My baby is sick. You're gonna
take me there to get what he needs.

20:57.840 --> 20:59.382
Right now.

21:02.386 --> 21:04.387
It's not far from here.

21:18.861 --> 21:22.280
Jack, may I have a word with you?

21:23.616 --> 21:24.991
Sure.

21:26.869 --> 21:29.704
- Who is he?
- What?

21:30.706 --> 21:33.208
The man that you are keeping
in the hatch.

21:38.965 --> 21:41.549
- Did Locke...
- Locke did not tell me anything.

21:41.634 --> 21:43.635
Who is he?

21:46.722 --> 21:51.309
- I wish to speak to him.
- Speak to him about what?

21:51.394 --> 21:53.478
I wish to speak to him alone.

21:54.188 --> 21:56.189
Can you arrange this?

21:57.900 --> 21:59.901
Why should I do that?

22:00.736 --> 22:03.071
Because you wish to keep this a secret.

22:26.303 --> 22:28.430
Why are we stopping here?

22:29.432 --> 22:31.641
This is where you scratched me.

22:32.935 --> 22:35.020
But there's nothing here.

22:36.981 --> 22:40.025
- Where do we go next?
- Why are you asking me that?

22:40.109 --> 22:43.194
- You need to tell me where to go.
- Where is this room?

22:43.279 --> 22:46.364
How can you be saying that?
OK, you grabbed me.

22:46.449 --> 22:49.784
I scratched you because
you were taking me back to them!

22:49.869 --> 22:51.786
Is that what you think?

22:53.706 --> 22:57.417
You said you remembered!
That's why I brought you here!

22:58.961 --> 23:02.505
- You lied!
- Hey! Get your hands off of her!

23:15.144 --> 23:16.728
Go ahead.

23:17.855 --> 23:19.230
Please.

23:20.066 --> 23:21.316
Do it.

23:31.869 --> 23:40.710
Claire!

23:56.435 --> 23:57.727
Wake up.

23:59.563 --> 24:03.608
- How's it coming?
- One down, one to go.

24:03.692 --> 24:06.027
All we need is a little foot
to put it on, huh?

24:08.155 --> 24:13.451
Tell you what. What do you say
we sneak out of here and take a walk?

24:13.536 --> 24:14.702
OK.

24:17.414 --> 24:21.584
Whoa! I'm sorry this is the first time
I've managed to get you out.

24:21.669 --> 24:24.254
- My friends are afraid you'll run away.
- Whoops!

24:24.338 --> 24:27.966
- Whoa! Don't tell on me, OK?
- OK.

24:28.050 --> 24:30.760
Whoa. Easy now. All right.

24:32.429 --> 24:34.973
- Easy. Easy!
- Whoo!

24:35.057 --> 24:37.559
- Whoa.
- Yeah!

24:37.643 --> 24:39.477
OK, here, this'll help.

24:40.604 --> 24:42.480
Oh, thanks.

24:46.235 --> 24:47.193
What?

24:47.278 --> 24:49.696
- That is really sour.
- Is it?

24:50.281 --> 24:51.656
I hadn't noticed.

24:55.077 --> 24:58.204
Oh! Hey, he's kicking!

25:00.249 --> 25:03.126
- May I?
- Yeah.

25:07.590 --> 25:10.842
- Claire, can I tell you a secret?
- Yeah.

25:10.926 --> 25:14.304
I'm going to miss you. I...

25:16.557 --> 25:18.766
I wish you didn't have to go.

25:20.269 --> 25:22.437
Well, maybe I don't have to go.

25:24.315 --> 25:26.232
We've been through this, Claire.

25:26.317 --> 25:29.277
There's not enough vaccine
for you and the baby.

25:29.361 --> 25:32.030
- But I'm not... I'm not sick.
- Thank God.

25:32.114 --> 25:33.823
And once you've delivered,

25:33.908 --> 25:37.452
you can go back to your friends
and hopefully you'll stay that way.

25:39.455 --> 25:42.707
But, what...
What if I want to see the baby?

25:46.337 --> 25:50.715
Hey, nobody is going to take him
from you unless that's what you want.

25:51.342 --> 25:53.426
You have a choice.

25:58.474 --> 26:02.310
We're good people, Claire.
We're a good family.

26:03.729 --> 26:09.442
But if you're going to trust us with
your child, I want you to be sure.

26:13.489 --> 26:15.073
OK?

26:30.464 --> 26:31.589
Sure.

26:35.261 --> 26:36.928
There you are.

26:39.265 --> 26:41.182
Where are you going?

26:46.522 --> 26:49.774
I know this is it. It's here.

26:49.858 --> 26:51.609
Claire?

26:56.365 --> 26:58.616
- Leave her alone.
- Excuse me?

26:58.701 --> 27:01.703
- Let her look.
- Look for what?

27:07.918 --> 27:13.756
Claire!

28:23.577 --> 28:25.370
Flashlights.

28:45.057 --> 28:50.186
No lights. I'm gonna see
if I can turn the power on. You OK?

28:56.568 --> 28:58.319
This way.

29:39.361 --> 29:41.529
What is this place?

29:41.613 --> 29:43.656
It's where they were going to keep him.

30:42.049 --> 30:44.634
Wake up!

30:44.718 --> 30:46.219
Wake up.

30:47.429 --> 30:49.305
- Who are you?
- Shh!

30:49.389 --> 30:52.642
They'll hear you.
Look, you have to get out of here.

30:52.726 --> 30:55.436
- What?
- You have to get out of here. Now.

30:55.521 --> 30:58.272
- What? No, no, no. I can't leave.
- Yes, you can.

30:58.357 --> 31:01.192
- I can't leave! No!
- Come on.

31:01.276 --> 31:03.611
- What are you doing?
- Shh!

31:05.781 --> 31:07.031
Shh.

31:11.203 --> 31:12.703
Don't scream.

31:15.582 --> 31:19.252
- They're gonna do it tonight.
- What? Do what?

31:19.336 --> 31:21.087
- Shh!
- What are you talking about?

31:21.171 --> 31:24.465
You are going to die.
They are gonna cut him out of you.

31:25.217 --> 31:28.010
I can get you back to your camp,
but we have to leave now.

31:28.095 --> 31:29.220
Hey, you're lying!

31:29.304 --> 31:32.223
- You're lying! OK? I'm sure about this!
- Shh!

31:32.307 --> 31:34.058
- I want to talk to Ethan.
- Stop!

31:34.142 --> 31:36.894
- Ethan wouldn't hurt me.
- Shh!

31:36.979 --> 31:39.397
You'll thank me for this one day.

31:39.481 --> 31:41.065
It's a vaccine.

31:41.149 --> 31:42.942
We don't want him to get sick.

31:46.154 --> 31:49.031
It's here. The medicine's here.

31:59.418 --> 32:01.210
Help me.

32:03.171 --> 32:06.591
Help! Kate! Come here, I need some help!

32:08.010 --> 32:11.262
- Help me out with this.
- What is it?

32:11.346 --> 32:14.390
It's in here. The vaccine's in here!

32:15.350 --> 32:16.809
OK, come on.

32:16.893 --> 32:20.062
OK. One, two, three!

32:26.445 --> 32:27.987
OK.

32:33.869 --> 32:36.996
It was in here! The vaccine was in here!

32:37.080 --> 32:39.206
Where is it? Where is it?

32:39.291 --> 32:41.667
The vaccine was in here! Where is it?

32:42.669 --> 32:44.920
You were bringing me back here!
Where is it?

32:45.005 --> 32:48.799
You know where it is, don't you?
Tell me! Tell me where it is!

32:48.884 --> 32:50.468
Tell me!

33:18.705 --> 33:21.916
Ethan? Ethan?

33:23.835 --> 33:26.921
Ethan? Ethan, I'm sure!

33:33.720 --> 33:35.096
Ethan!

33:36.765 --> 33:40.518
Hey, hey, Ethan! Ethan!

33:41.228 --> 33:44.605
I'm... I'm sure!
I want you take the baby.

33:45.607 --> 33:46.941
Ethan.

33:54.616 --> 33:56.200
Who are... Who are you?

33:56.284 --> 33:59.453
- Claire?
- Yeah! I'm here!

33:59.538 --> 34:03.457
- I can hear you! Where are you?
- Quiet!

34:03.542 --> 34:06.335
- I'm here, Ethan!
- Be quiet.

34:06.420 --> 34:08.170
I have to give him to them.

34:08.255 --> 34:10.922
I have to give him to them
so he'll be safe. OK?

34:11.007 --> 34:14.385
Help! I'm here! Ethan!

34:14.469 --> 34:15.636
Claire!

34:18.223 --> 34:20.891
Claire! Where are you?

34:29.317 --> 34:33.404
You weren't trying to take me back,
were you?

34:35.824 --> 34:38.199
You were trying to save me.

34:40.078 --> 34:42.246
I carried you on my back to your camp.

34:43.998 --> 34:46.041
I left you where they would find you.

34:49.838 --> 34:51.505
I'm sorry.

34:58.680 --> 35:00.765
Where are you going?

35:04.019 --> 35:07.730
You're not the only one who didn't
find what they were looking for.

35:36.510 --> 35:38.219
This is as far as I go.

35:43.517 --> 35:45.434
Your baby...

35:47.354 --> 35:49.313
...was it a girl?

35:50.315 --> 35:52.858
- Yes.
- What was her name?

35:55.821 --> 35:57.071
Alex.

35:58.114 --> 35:59.615
Alexandra.

36:06.373 --> 36:08.582
I remember a girl.

36:09.459 --> 36:11.502
A girl with blue eyes.

36:15.090 --> 36:18.592
She, uh... She helped me. She saved me.

36:18.677 --> 36:20.469
Just like you did.

36:21.930 --> 36:23.889
She wasn't like the others.

36:26.059 --> 36:28.102
She was good.

36:42.158 --> 36:46.620
I am sorry that you didn't
find what you were looking for.

36:49.875 --> 36:52.501
And I hope your baby is not infected.

36:56.673 --> 36:58.465
But if it is...

37:01.803 --> 37:04.138
...I hope you know what must be done.

37:34.836 --> 37:36.503
Back for more tools?

37:37.422 --> 37:39.340
He knows, John.

37:42.052 --> 37:43.677
Well, there you go.

37:46.598 --> 37:51.435
Just be careful what you say to him.
He's smart and curious.

37:51.519 --> 37:56.315
- Just give us a shout when you're done.
- And if the alarm goes off...

37:56.399 --> 37:58.776
...don't tell him what it's for.

37:58.860 --> 38:00.903
What is it for?

38:20.006 --> 38:21.674
Hello.

38:28.556 --> 38:30.182
I am Mr. Eko.

38:33.895 --> 38:35.604
Henry Gale.

38:36.564 --> 38:38.315
Do you mind if I sit, Henry?

38:39.567 --> 38:41.068
OK.

38:51.246 --> 38:53.455
How long have you been in here?

38:54.416 --> 38:58.168
- Two days.
- Are they treating you well?

38:59.713 --> 39:01.588
Treating me well?

39:03.216 --> 39:05.801
I'm a... a prisoner.

39:07.012 --> 39:10.848
- And I don't know why or for what or...
- You are a prisoner

39:10.932 --> 39:12.933
because they are being careful.

39:14.269 --> 39:18.313
They are being careful
because they believe you are lying.

39:18.398 --> 39:20.399
Why would I lie?

39:21.526 --> 39:23.861
They think I'm one of these Others?

39:23.945 --> 39:27.406
- Other what?
- Please stop talking, Henry.

39:31.077 --> 39:33.996
The first night I spent on this island,

39:35.123 --> 39:38.584
I was dragged into the jungle
by two men.

39:40.170 --> 39:44.006
They never spoke a word to me,
nor I to them.

39:46.676 --> 39:48.302
I killed these men.

39:49.262 --> 39:51.764
Smashed in their head with a stone.

39:51.848 --> 39:53.640
Felt their blood on my arms.

39:58.563 --> 40:02.858
I need you to know
how sorry I am for this.

40:06.071 --> 40:10.741
I need you to know
that I am back on a righteous path now

40:10.825 --> 40:12.868
and that I regret my actions.

40:18.166 --> 40:20.459
I ask you for your forgiveness.

40:23.088 --> 40:25.005
Why are you telling me this?

40:27.008 --> 40:29.218
Because I needed to tell someone.

41:18.852 --> 41:22.271
He looks good. Fever's broken.

41:22.355 --> 41:26.942
- The rash has even started to fade.
- Thank you so much.

41:28.111 --> 41:29.653
I didn't do anything.

41:29.737 --> 41:33.282
- I'll check back in a couple hours, OK?
- OK.

41:56.347 --> 41:57.723
Look.

41:58.558 --> 42:00.601
Mummy made this for you

42:00.685 --> 42:03.437
when you were still inside her tummy.

42:11.988 --> 42:16.116
You know, I wanted them to take you.

42:22.874 --> 42:27.544
But now I know. Now I know
that we're supposed to be together.

42:28.630 --> 42:34.635
You and me. We're supposed
to take care of each other, OK?

42:43.144 --> 42:44.895
You're mine.

42:44.979 --> 42:47.564
And I love you. I love you so much.

42:49.651 --> 42:51.068
Yes.

43:14.467 --> 43:17.678
- No cheeseburgers, huh?
- No cheeseburgers.

43:17.762 --> 43:19.638
Bon appétit.

43:23.184 --> 43:25.769
Is that true
what you said about Hemingway?

43:29.023 --> 43:32.067
- You have good ears.
- You have thin doors.

43:37.031 --> 43:39.616
- You read Hemingway?
- Sure.

43:39.701 --> 43:43.203
Guy ran with the bulls.
Fought in the Spanish Civil War.

43:43.288 --> 43:46.832
Stuff I can wrap my brain around.
This, I can't get through five pages of.

43:48.584 --> 43:51.295
Dostoyevsky had his virtues, too.

43:51.379 --> 43:54.131
He was a genius, for one.

43:54.215 --> 43:56.091
Bullfighting isn't everything.

43:58.386 --> 43:59.928
So which one are you?

44:01.889 --> 44:04.766
- I'm sorry?
- Are you the genius?

44:04.851 --> 44:09.938
Or are you the guy who always feels like
he's living in the shadow of the genius?

44:12.066 --> 44:14.276
I was...

44:15.153 --> 44:18.822
I was never very much
into literary analysis.

44:25.872 --> 44:29.166
I just don't understand
why you let the doctor call the shots.

44:32.170 --> 44:34.171
No one calls the shots.

44:36.549 --> 44:38.717
Jack and I make decisions together.

44:41.179 --> 44:42.596
Right. OK.

44:48.102 --> 44:49.686
My mistake.
