THE OLD BUNNY TRAIL...

12:59.904 --> 13:00.779
AND THIS GUY
OFFERED ME $200

14:57.229 --> 15:00.899
DONNA, I HAVE TO
CONFESS SOMETHING.

15:01.066 --> 15:04.027
IT WASN'T TERRIBLE.

15:05.279 --> 15:07.405
HOW NOT TERRIBLE?

15:07.573 --> 15:10.450
IT WAS THE BEST KISS
OF MY LIFE!

I MEAN, FEZ IS TOTALLY
NOT AN OPTION

MICHAEL HAS NEVER
KISSED ME LIKE THAT.

15:19.752 --> 15:21.336
WHAT WAS SO GOOD
ABOUT IT?

15:21.503 --> 15:23.004
DO YOU KNOW
WHEN FEZ TALKS,

15:23.172 --> 15:27.175
HE SOMETIMES
ROLLS HIS Rs?

15:27.343 --> 15:31.554
WELL, THAT'S WHAT
HE DID IN MY MOUTH!

15:33.641 --> 15:34.891
REALLY?

15:35.059 --> 15:36.517
THAT ACTUALLY SOUNDS
KIND OF COOL.

15:36.685 --> 15:38.102
I KNOW!

15:38.270 --> 15:39.896
I MEAN,
DON'T GET ME WRONG.

15:40.064 --> 15:41.230
ERIC'S, YOU KNOW, HE'S A GREAT
KISSER AND EVERYTHING, BUT...

15:41.398 --> 15:45.860
HE'S NEVER, LIKE,
ROLLED ANYTHING.

15:46.028 --> 15:47.445
OH... I JUST
LOVE KISSING.

15:47.613 --> 15:50.406

16:05.464 --> 16:07.632
SEE, HYDE?

16:07.800 --> 16:10.635
I ASKED YOU NOT TO MAKE SPECIAL
BROWNIES, BUT DID YOU LISTEN?

16:10.803 --> 16:13.930
WELL... EXACTLY.
YOU DIDN'T.

16:14.098 --> 16:18.184
YOU WERE JUST SOOO SMART.

16:18.352 --> 16:20.103
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

16:20.270 --> 16:23.690
I... YEAH, THAT'S IT. RIGHT.
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

16:23.857 --> 16:25.441
YOU WEREN'T
THINKING.

16:25.609 --> 16:28.152
NOW MY FOLKS ARE FRIED,
AND I GOT NO CAR.

16:28.320 --> 16:29.779

16:36.412 --> 16:37.912
GUESS WHAT, BUDDY.

16:38.080 --> 16:40.832
THERE'S A LESSON
IN ALL THIS.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.501
YOU KNOW WHAT
THAT LESSON IS?

16:43.669 --> 16:45.211
THE LESSON IS...
ALL RIGHT,

16:45.379 --> 16:48.965
WHY DON'T I JUST TELL
YOU WHAT THE LESSON IS?

16:49.133 --> 16:51.801
YOU DANCE WITH MARY JANE, YOU
GET YOUR TOES STEPPED ON,

16:51.969 --> 16:53.011
THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

16:53.178 --> 16:54.470
CONSEQUENCES, MY FRIEND.

16:54.638 --> 16:57.557
YEAH, CONSEQUENCES.

16:57.725 --> 16:58.891
NOW MY CAR IS GONE,

16:59.059 --> 17:01.185
RED'S HIGH

WHO I SOLD THE CAR TO.

17:12.990 --> 17:14.615
WHO?

17:14.783 --> 17:17.285
I DON'T KNOW,

ON THAT CHECK HE GAVE ME!

17:28.505 --> 17:29.839
YEAH!

17:30.007 --> 17:33.509
MAYBE IT IS.

17:44.313 --> 17:46.064

18:02.498 --> 18:06.584
[AS FEZ] I'M FEZ.

18:06.752 --> 18:08.002
IN MY COUNTRY,

18:08.170 --> 18:10.338
WE MAKE OUT WITH
OUR FRIENDS' GIRLFRIENDS

18:10.506 --> 18:13.591
BECAUSE... LA DEE DA.

18:16.095 --> 18:17.595
OH, KELSO, I AM SORRY.

18:17.763 --> 18:20.890
YOUR GIRLFRIEND GIVES ME
ACTION IN THE PANTS.

18:21.975 --> 18:23.267
OH, NO, SHE DOESN'T.

18:23.435 --> 18:25.103
YES, SHE DOES.

18:25.270 --> 18:26.979
SHE CAME UP TO ME.
SHE SAID I WAS FUNNY.

18:27.147 --> 18:28.397
FEZ...

18:28.565 --> 18:29.982
SOMETIMES...

18:30.150 --> 18:31.567
WHEN A GIRL SAYS
THAT YOU'RE FUNNY,

18:31.735 --> 18:34.821
IT JUST MEANS
THAT YOU'RE FUNNY.

18:34.988 --> 18:36.364
WELL...

18:36.532 --> 18:39.450

BETWEEN US,

18:44.998 --> 18:49.335
AND NOBODY CAN COME
BETWEEN THAT BOND.

18:49.503 --> 18:51.963

19:01.431 --> 19:07.478
YOU ARE A WHORE.

19:07.646 --> 19:10.356
OKAY, THEN.
APOLOGY ACCEPTED.

19:13.610 --> 19:17.280

GOING FOR ICE CREAM!

19:17.447 --> 19:18.614
WHEN WE GET
THE CAR BACK.

19:18.782 --> 19:20.366

WERE GONNA GET HIM ICE CREAM.

19:20.534 --> 19:21.576

19:21.743 --> 19:23.536
AND YOU'RE NOT HELPING!

19:23.704 --> 19:27.665
HEY, PUT THAT DOWN!

19:30.711 --> 19:33.963

19:50.397 --> 19:51.314
WELL, YOU HAVE TO.

19:51.481 --> 19:53.524
I'LL WAIT IN THE CAR.

19:53.692 --> 19:54.859
NO, NO, RED.

19:55.027 --> 19:56.277
YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO
TAKE RESPONSIBILITY

19:56.445 --> 19:57.778
FOR YOUR OWN ACTIONS.

19:57.946 --> 20:00.740
WELL, THAT'S STUPID!

20:00.908 --> 20:02.992
YEAH?

20:03.160 --> 20:06.954

THIS MORNING?

20:08.874 --> 20:10.458
A STATION WAGON? YEAH.

20:10.626 --> 20:12.668
HE BOUGHT THAT PIECE
OF CRAP FOR ME.

20:12.836 --> 20:15.046
"PIECE OF CRAP"?

20:15.214 --> 20:18.216
THAT'S A VISTA CRUISER!

20:18.383 --> 20:20.676
YOU COULD LITERALLY...

20:20.844 --> 20:25.056
CRUUUISE THE VISTA.

20:25.224 --> 20:29.143
