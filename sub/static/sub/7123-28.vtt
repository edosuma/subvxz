06:30.123 --> 06:31.818

to that guy's port.

06:31.891 --> 06:33.688

Did I hear "Beemo"?

Hey, I'm Moe.

Don't worry.
My legs don't work.

09:00.506 --> 09:04.237
You're Moe?
Wait, are you human, too?

09:04.310 --> 09:05.902

[Panting]

09:17.323 --> 09:18.950
It is Beemo.

09:19.025 --> 09:22.620
Looks like there's some
software problems.

09:25.164 --> 09:25.994
Hmm.

09:26.065 --> 09:29.523
FINN:
So... you made Beemo?

09:29.602 --> 09:31.229
Hey, you're not gonna reset

09:31.304 --> 09:32.828
our friend's personality,
are you?

09:32.905 --> 09:35.373
Huh? What?
No.

09:35.441 --> 09:37.204
Beemo's one-of-a-kind.

09:37.276 --> 09:39.676
I built Beemo to take care
of my son.

09:39.745 --> 09:41.838
Yeah... oh, oh, thank you.

09:41.914 --> 09:45.179
But I guess I never ended up
dating any women.

09:45.251 --> 09:48.550
[Chuckles]
So, that's that.

09:48.621 --> 09:50.589
I sent Beemo off
into the world alone,

09:50.656 --> 09:52.647
hoping...
[coughs]

09:52.725 --> 09:54.989
He could find a fam...
[coughs]

09:55.061 --> 09:56.926
A family of his own.
[Coughs]

09:56.996 --> 09:58.657
And maybe even find

09:58.731 --> 10:00.995
somebody else's little boy
to take care of.

10:01.067 --> 10:02.125
Aww.

10:02.201 --> 10:05.364
Oh, there's that back-up
driver disk.

10:05.438 --> 10:07.998
Thank you.

10:08.074 --> 10:09.598
That ought to done it.

10:09.675 --> 10:12.269
I must have built, what, like,
a million Mos,

10:12.345 --> 10:15.872
but Beemo is very,
very special.

10:15.948 --> 10:21.511
I built Beemo to understand fun
and how to play.

You see, I made Beemo
