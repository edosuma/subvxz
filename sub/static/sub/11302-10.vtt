WEBVTT

00:07.174 --> 00:09.342
- Hey, morning.
- Hey.

00:09.426 --> 00:11.719
Hey... is that my jacket?

00:12.638 --> 00:13.722
I left that at Heather's.

00:13.806 --> 00:15.516
All right, Officer Sherlock.

00:16.517 --> 00:18.117
Yeah, I slept at Mary's the other night.

00:18.138 --> 00:19.461
Heather told me to give you this.

00:20.312 --> 00:22.690
She also told me to give you this.

00:25.025 --> 00:26.234
What the hell you do that for?

00:26.318 --> 00:27.653
Well, now it's
awkward 'cause I kissed you,

00:27.736 --> 00:28.588
not 'cause I'm banging

00:28.612 --> 00:30.160
your girlfriend's mom.

00:30.823 --> 00:32.533
You know what, I ain't
gonna be super-interested

00:32.616 --> 00:34.577
in joking about this for a while.

00:34.660 --> 00:37.245
Look, Colt... Sorry
if it's awkward for you,

00:37.329 --> 00:39.247
but I'm really into Mary.

00:39.331 --> 00:41.208
That being said, you are my brother,

00:41.291 --> 00:43.085
and if you want me to stop datin' her...

00:43.168 --> 00:44.419
just say it.

00:45.545 --> 00:46.797
I want you to stop datin' her.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.423
All right, bluff called.

00:50.884 --> 00:52.010
Seriously though, man,

00:52.094 --> 00:53.778
if you want me to give up my chance

00:53.803 --> 00:55.580
at a happy relationship and die alone

00:55.639 --> 00:57.307
just 'cause it makes
you a little uncomfortable...

00:57.390 --> 00:58.559
you just say so.

00:59.476 --> 01:01.353
Thank you, I appreciate that.

01:02.395 --> 01:04.188
Shit, bluff called again.

01:05.941 --> 01:06.942
All right, look...

01:07.818 --> 01:09.820
if you're serious about Mary,

01:09.903 --> 01:11.477
and you promise not to screw things up

01:11.502 --> 01:12.429
with me and Heather...

01:13.991 --> 01:16.243
it's your life, I'm not
gonna be an asshole about it.

01:16.952 --> 01:18.203
Cool.

01:18.286 --> 01:19.580
And for the record,

01:19.663 --> 01:21.539
I give you my
blessing to date her daughter.

01:22.791 --> 01:24.209
Oh, hey, uh...

01:25.127 --> 01:27.587
I heard old Kenny proposed to Abby.

01:27.671 --> 01:29.965
Yeah. Why, you wanna date her, too?

01:30.924 --> 01:32.718
Been there, done that.

01:34.219 --> 01:37.389
So... them getting
engaged, that mess you up?

01:37.472 --> 01:39.975
No... I'm fine with it.

01:40.058 --> 01:42.394
You should've seen the
ring though, too big.

01:42.477 --> 01:44.062
Yeah...

01:44.146 --> 01:45.939
Women hate when things are too big.

01:47.440 --> 01:49.609
Yeah, and he proposed to
her at the Cracker Barrel.

01:49.693 --> 01:50.694
I mean, who does that?

01:51.779 --> 01:53.697
Uh, lots of people.

01:53.781 --> 01:55.424
Rich Weiner proposed to Allie there,

01:55.448 --> 01:56.557
Jeff proposed to Leslie.

01:56.617 --> 01:58.786
I proposed a
threesome to the Flet sisters.

02:00.162 --> 02:02.539
They proposed I go fuck myself.

02:05.208 --> 02:07.129
Later that night, I took
'em up on that proposal.

02:09.378 --> 02:11.006
Let me ask you a question...

02:11.089 --> 02:12.633
I texted Mary a couple
of times last night,

02:12.716 --> 02:14.384
she never hit me back.

02:14.467 --> 02:16.303
Check this out. Uh, 1:12...

02:16.386 --> 02:17.721
"'Sup, girl? You up?"

02:19.556 --> 02:21.349
Nothing. 1:27...

02:21.433 --> 02:23.686
"You down to clown? I'm around."

02:26.021 --> 02:27.648
Nothing.

02:27.731 --> 02:29.650
1:45, I pull out the big guns, right?

02:29.733 --> 02:31.592
I sent her this video of a cat

02:31.617 --> 02:34.095
who's scared of a cucumber.

02:34.154 --> 02:37.532
I mean, how is that not
worth at least one "LOL"?

02:37.615 --> 02:39.349
Apparently, we got different ideas

02:39.374 --> 02:40.810
about what the "big gun" is.

02:43.538 --> 02:44.873
- Mornin', Dad.
- Mornin'.

02:44.957 --> 02:47.250
Hey, what time is that buyer comin'?

02:47.334 --> 02:50.170
He's not. I called him off.

02:50.253 --> 02:52.881
- We're not sellin'.
- What?

02:53.757 --> 02:56.259
Cattle prices are at rock bottom...

02:56.343 --> 03:00.513
Anderson sold last week. They
didn't even turn a profit.

03:00.597 --> 03:02.349
We're not gonna sell right now.

03:02.432 --> 03:03.892
We're gonna hold out.

03:05.227 --> 03:08.188
Are you serious? I... When
were you plannin' on tellin' us?

03:08.731 --> 03:10.315
To be honest...

03:10.398 --> 03:14.111
If I'm not looking right at
you, I try to forget you're here.

03:17.072 --> 03:19.657
Dad, we don't have any electricity!

03:19.742 --> 03:22.494
We gotta
sell. You ever see The Shining?

03:22.577 --> 03:24.599
Jack Nicholson killed his entire family

03:24.624 --> 03:25.938
with an ax. You know why?

03:25.998 --> 03:27.374
They didn't have a TV!

03:29.960 --> 03:32.921
Look, we can't afford
to keep the calves.

03:33.005 --> 03:34.798
We can't even afford
to keep the lights on.

03:35.883 --> 03:37.425
What are we gonna do for
the winter, huh? I mean...

03:37.509 --> 03:39.928
me and you, we can eat
Colt. What are the cows gonna eat?

03:41.722 --> 03:43.932
I didn't work my ass off all year,

03:44.016 --> 03:46.518
so I could go in the hole.

03:46.601 --> 03:49.312
We can hold on a little
while, things will turn.

03:50.438 --> 03:51.502
And what if they don't?

03:51.528 --> 03:53.425
Maybe you two can get a second job.

03:53.483 --> 03:54.098
Ugh.

03:54.123 --> 03:55.967
There aren't enough hours in the day

03:56.028 --> 03:57.154
to take on more work.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.133
We should take what we can get now

03:59.158 --> 04:00.890
and keep our heads above water.

04:00.949 --> 04:02.743
All right, look, I
don't normally say this,

04:02.826 --> 04:04.244
but Rooster's right.

04:06.288 --> 04:08.248
You know, I don't normally say this,

04:08.331 --> 04:10.417
but I don't give a shit what you think.

04:12.753 --> 04:15.422
You say that all the time!

05:33.583 --> 05:34.835
Damn it.

05:38.421 --> 05:40.423
We both saw that. Colt did it.

05:41.967 --> 05:44.302
Beau, you in there?

05:44.386 --> 05:46.554
If I say no, will you go away?

05:47.597 --> 05:49.516
I see you're as chipper as ever.

05:49.599 --> 05:51.434
What are you doin' here, Dale?

05:51.518 --> 05:54.396
I heard that you might be
thinkin' about not sellin'.

05:54.479 --> 05:56.481
- How'd you hear that?
- Huh?

05:56.564 --> 05:58.441
Said, "How'd you hear that?"

05:58.525 --> 06:00.360
I hear everything.

06:02.070 --> 06:03.989
I think you're makin' a big mistake.

06:04.072 --> 06:07.117
Look, Dale, don't tell
me how to run my business.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.785
I don't tell you how to run yours.

06:08.868 --> 06:11.538
Well, that's all you do! The
last time I was out here,

06:11.621 --> 06:13.873
you tried to tell me how
to castrate a bull.

06:15.250 --> 06:17.044
I'm not gonna sell, Dale.

06:17.127 --> 06:20.505
Look... we're getting
up in age, both of us.

06:20.588 --> 06:21.817
Now I'm 73 years old,

06:21.842 --> 06:24.241
and I don't know if you knew it or not,

06:24.301 --> 06:26.344
but I'm beginning to lose my hearing.

06:27.595 --> 06:30.057
Really? I had no idea.

06:30.140 --> 06:33.351
Yeah, it's just a Timex, but thank you.

06:35.979 --> 06:37.278
And look, at your age,

06:37.303 --> 06:39.840
do you really want
to take on this fight?

06:39.899 --> 06:42.735
You know, what they're
offering is criminal.

06:42.819 --> 06:44.821
I'm not sayin' you're wrong.

06:46.031 --> 06:47.746
Look, you deserve a lot more,

06:47.771 --> 06:50.017
but a little is better than nothing.

06:50.077 --> 06:53.121
For all you know, the
market might keep going down.

06:53.205 --> 06:55.373
You don't think I know that?

06:55.457 --> 06:57.125
What are you gonna tell me next?

06:57.209 --> 06:59.502
Sky is blue? Water's wet?

06:59.586 --> 07:01.671
Next thing out of your
mouth is gonna be "What?"

07:01.754 --> 07:03.090
What?

07:04.466 --> 07:07.385
Look, just make the sale.

07:07.469 --> 07:11.723
Go inside, turn your power
on, enjoy your family.

07:11.806 --> 07:15.852
If this is your last winter on Earth...

07:15.936 --> 07:18.771
do you want to spend
it without television?

07:21.233 --> 07:24.277
I'm not selling. Say
hi to Charlene for me.

07:24.361 --> 07:26.529
Well, suit yourself.

07:27.614 --> 07:29.992
You know, your gate's busted.

07:30.908 --> 07:31.909
Colt did it.

07:31.994 --> 07:36.123
Mmm-hmm. He also clipped
your mailbox on the way in.

07:42.545 --> 07:44.381
Hey, Ab.

07:44.464 --> 07:45.673
Hey.

07:49.636 --> 07:51.346
You still got time to
take a look at my truck?

07:53.515 --> 07:55.142
Yeah.

07:55.225 --> 07:56.893
What was that noise it's making, again?

07:59.437 --> 08:01.398
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I remember.

08:01.481 --> 08:02.555
I just wanted to hear you

08:02.580 --> 08:04.383
do that bad impression again.

08:05.235 --> 08:07.570
Why don't you do an impression
of a guy who's not a jackass

08:07.654 --> 08:08.989
and just fixes my truck?

08:10.157 --> 08:11.616
So, what's going on with you?

08:11.699 --> 08:14.244
Well, Dad decided he didn't
want to sell the calves.

08:14.327 --> 08:15.912
Why?

08:15.996 --> 08:17.623
Said he wanted to hold
out for better prices.

08:17.705 --> 08:19.348
Same thing he used to say when I used to

08:19.373 --> 08:20.774
bring over the Girl Scout cookies.

08:22.919 --> 08:25.213
Well, let's take a
look at that truck, huh?

08:25.297 --> 08:26.339
Yeah.

08:28.258 --> 08:31.553
Look at that rock. Whoo!

08:31.636 --> 08:34.139
Guess that's what Kenny's Marriott
money gets you, huh?

08:34.222 --> 08:35.933
Yeah, he went to Jared.

08:38.018 --> 08:39.445
You know, about the other night,

08:39.470 --> 08:41.253
that wasn't how I wanted it to happen.

08:41.313 --> 08:42.438
What's that?

08:42.522 --> 08:44.552
Me finding out or
you getting proposed to

08:44.577 --> 08:45.591
at a Cracker Barrel?

08:45.650 --> 08:47.944
It was actually sweet.

08:48.028 --> 08:50.113
And they gave us 20 bucks to
spend in the general store.

08:50.197 --> 08:52.490
We got a big bag of those sour rolls.

08:52.574 --> 08:54.826
So good.

08:56.578 --> 08:59.164
Anyway, if it was awkward for you...

08:59.247 --> 09:00.248
I'm sorry.

09:02.459 --> 09:03.668
Why would it be awkward?

09:03.751 --> 09:05.920
Well, it was weird for me.

09:06.003 --> 09:07.702
I mean, I didn't expect to get engaged

09:07.727 --> 09:08.989
in front of my ex-boyfriend.

09:09.049 --> 09:11.176
Although I do have this dream

09:11.259 --> 09:12.822
that I get married to Channing Tatum

09:12.847 --> 09:14.620
in front of every
guy who ever dumped me.

09:17.849 --> 09:19.226
Kenny's a good guy.

09:19.892 --> 09:22.000
He's smart, he's got a great job.

09:22.025 --> 09:24.380
I'm sure he's got one of them 400k's.

09:24.439 --> 09:26.108
It's 401k.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.277
Even better.

09:30.903 --> 09:34.407
Look, you guys are great together.

09:34.491 --> 09:36.691
I think you'll have a long,
happy life here in Garrison.

09:38.120 --> 09:39.586
Unless Channing Tatum shows up

09:39.611 --> 09:41.272
to shoot the Colt Bennett story.

09:41.331 --> 09:43.833
Peter Dinklage is gonna play Rooster.

09:49.464 --> 09:51.508
Oh, hey, Mary.

09:52.509 --> 09:53.718
Nice hog.

09:55.262 --> 09:57.805
Hey, Colt. You cheatin' on my daughter?

09:57.889 --> 09:59.056
'Cause I will murder you.

09:59.141 --> 10:02.435
No, no. No, no... No,
no. This is, uh, Abby.

10:02.519 --> 10:04.896
She's my ex-girlfriend.
We hang out sometimes.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.357
That does not sound better, does it?

10:07.440 --> 10:08.983
Mmm-mmm.

10:09.066 --> 10:10.985
Hi, I'm Mary. Nice to meet you.

10:11.068 --> 10:14.489
Actually, we've met. I was
Heather's history teacher.

10:14.572 --> 10:17.200
Oh, yeah! How'd she do?

10:17.284 --> 10:19.411
Well, she
wasn't my worst student.

10:19.494 --> 10:21.204
I'll take it.

10:23.039 --> 10:25.500
Oh,
damn! Look at that Harley.

10:25.583 --> 10:28.002
I did not think you could
get any more awesome.

10:28.085 --> 10:31.047
Hey, if you can name three
Denver Broncos, I'll marry you.

10:32.632 --> 10:33.836
Peyton Manning, CJ Anderson,

10:33.861 --> 10:35.451
Emmanuel Sanders, Demaryius Thomas.

10:35.510 --> 10:37.094
Whoo! I'm gonna pass out.

10:38.263 --> 10:40.014
Rooster, can we, uh, go inside?

10:40.097 --> 10:41.599
You know we can.

10:41.683 --> 10:44.352
Oh, Abby, by the way... congrats
on that engagement.

10:44.436 --> 10:47.439
Is it cool if I bring Colt's
girlfriend's mom to your wedding?

10:48.440 --> 10:49.774
Uh, okay.

10:52.694 --> 10:54.487
I have a name, you know?

10:54.571 --> 10:56.072
Yeah, I know. Sorry about that.

10:56.156 --> 10:59.075
It just pisses off Colt a shit-ton
more when I do it this way.

11:01.118 --> 11:02.620
So what's up? Did you get my text?

11:02.704 --> 11:04.164
My sexy pics come through?

11:06.333 --> 11:08.585
Yes, Rooster, I got the
picture of your balls.

11:10.837 --> 11:12.270
Thank God. I thought I sent it

11:12.295 --> 11:13.822
to the other Mary in my phone.

11:15.049 --> 11:16.801
Sister Mary from Immaculate Heart.

11:18.261 --> 11:20.513
Okay, we need to set a
few ground rules here.

11:20.597 --> 11:22.374
Number one being, don't send me

11:22.399 --> 11:24.291
pictures of your fucking balls.

11:25.518 --> 11:27.998
Yeah, everyone sends dick pics.

11:28.023 --> 11:30.422
The Rooster sends ball pics.

11:32.149 --> 11:35.237
'Cause it's funny and sexy.

11:36.238 --> 11:38.990
No, uh-uh. It's stupid and disgusting.

11:41.033 --> 11:42.702
Agree to disagree.

11:42.785 --> 11:45.288
Listen, if you think
you're interested in

11:45.372 --> 11:47.707
and capable of being in
an adult relationship...

11:47.790 --> 11:49.542
- I do.
- Then... Okay.

11:49.626 --> 11:52.254
You say that, but you texted
me a picture of your balls.

11:55.673 --> 11:57.174
I did.

11:57.259 --> 11:59.041
Yeah. Do you... do you see how those

11:59.065 --> 12:00.701
two things might not go together?

12:01.679 --> 12:03.180
I don't.

12:05.099 --> 12:07.727
No, I'm kidding. I'm
kidding. But, you know, I mean...

12:07.810 --> 12:10.130
You're asking me to change who
I am, you know? It's like...

12:10.187 --> 12:12.524
you date the Rooster, you get the beak.

12:15.067 --> 12:18.821
I'm fine with the beak. I
just don't want the balls.

12:23.034 --> 12:24.118
You think about it.

12:24.201 --> 12:25.703
If you decide you want to give this

12:25.728 --> 12:27.103
a real shot, you give me a call.

12:27.163 --> 12:29.624
- Wait, you're leaving?
- I got the dinner shift.

12:29.707 --> 12:32.168
You just came over here to talk?

12:35.297 --> 12:37.549
See, that's what...
that's what adults do.

12:39.301 --> 12:41.636
All right, well, before
you leave, can you, uh...

12:41.719 --> 12:43.346
name off a couple more Broncos?

12:46.057 --> 12:47.058
Von Miller...

12:49.185 --> 12:50.645
Brandon McManus.

12:50.728 --> 12:52.564
Oh, my
God. You know the kicker!

13:09.163 --> 13:12.750
You scared me. Why are you
standing there like a creep?

13:12.834 --> 13:15.294
I like listening to you sing.

13:15.378 --> 13:16.796
That's sweet.

13:16.879 --> 13:19.131
Still creepy, but sweet.

13:20.091 --> 13:21.551
Did you bring the rolls?

13:22.510 --> 13:24.394
Oh, didn't think I had to mention

13:24.418 --> 13:26.079
that they needed to be baked.

13:27.056 --> 13:31.518
But dinner will be in 12 to 15
minutes or until golden brown.

13:34.105 --> 13:35.482
How're you doin'?

13:36.483 --> 13:38.150
I called off the calf sale.

13:38.901 --> 13:41.446
Whoa. You sure you wanna do that?

13:42.780 --> 13:44.532
I'm not sure about anything.

13:45.783 --> 13:47.284
I'm dead tired.

13:48.202 --> 13:51.080
Boys have been working
hard. They deserve a break.

13:52.289 --> 13:54.125
Don't tell 'em I said that.

13:56.961 --> 13:58.921
I won't, but you should.

13:59.005 --> 14:01.173
They need to hear that you
think they did a good job.

14:01.257 --> 14:02.925
I'll put it in my will.

14:05.219 --> 14:07.514
They think I should sell.

14:07.597 --> 14:09.474
Dale thinks I should sell.

14:10.683 --> 14:12.445
Based on your reaction,

14:12.470 --> 14:14.920
I guess you feel the same way.

14:16.981 --> 14:19.817
Maybe I'm just being stubborn
in my old age.

14:19.901 --> 14:21.819
In your old age?

14:21.903 --> 14:23.810
Beau, you've written in Ronald Reagan

14:23.835 --> 14:25.138
the last three elections.

14:27.158 --> 14:29.911
My gut's telling me to hold out longer.

14:32.079 --> 14:35.583
Then trust it. It's gotten you this far.

14:38.836 --> 14:40.588
What about us, Mags?

14:41.839 --> 14:43.049
You comin' home?

14:48.262 --> 14:49.431
Okay.

14:51.265 --> 14:53.435
- Really?
- Yeah.

14:53.518 --> 14:55.478
Maybe it's time to give it a shot.

14:56.479 --> 14:59.315
Even if you are a broke old man.

15:00.942 --> 15:03.570
We said in our vows
for richer or poorer.

15:05.112 --> 15:07.239
No, we actually didn't say vows.

15:08.074 --> 15:10.201
I read a poem by Robert Frost,

15:10.284 --> 15:12.620
and you said, "Yep."

15:14.706 --> 15:16.624
I still feel the same way today.

15:18.292 --> 15:19.376
Do you?

15:20.294 --> 15:21.629
Yep.

15:27.969 --> 15:29.471
Sorry I didn't answer your texts.

15:29.554 --> 15:30.727
I had my phone on silent

15:30.752 --> 15:32.413
'cause my sister was passed out.

15:32.474 --> 15:33.725
I didn't wanna wake up her baby.

15:33.808 --> 15:36.102
If you add a pick-up
truck and an American flag,

15:36.185 --> 15:38.187
you get yourself a country song.

15:38.270 --> 15:39.522
Can I ask you something?

15:39.606 --> 15:40.982
Yeah, what's up?

15:41.065 --> 15:43.068
Just... you were acting kind of weird

15:43.093 --> 15:44.884
after Kenny and Abby got engaged.

15:46.320 --> 15:47.681
Is there something going on there?

15:49.240 --> 15:52.159
No. Me and Abby is just friends.

15:52.827 --> 15:56.413
Yeah, but you kept saying they
don't belong together and...

15:56.498 --> 15:59.376
I just don't think you were talking
about the chicken and waffles.

15:59.459 --> 16:02.003
Look, there's nothing
going on with me and Abby.

16:02.086 --> 16:03.212
I'm just saying,

16:03.295 --> 16:05.131
if you saw me acting like
that with an old boyfriend of mine,

16:05.214 --> 16:06.298
you'd have some questions.

16:06.382 --> 16:07.780
No, I wouldn't. I'd believe you

16:07.805 --> 16:09.743
when you said there
was nothing going on.

16:09.802 --> 16:10.970
So just drop it.

16:11.888 --> 16:13.848
All right, it was just a question.

16:13.931 --> 16:16.643
- You don't have to be a dick.
- I'm not being a dick.

16:16.726 --> 16:17.769
I'm in a great mood.

16:17.852 --> 16:19.194
My ex-girlfriend got engaged.

16:19.219 --> 16:20.837
The ranch's running out of money.

16:20.897 --> 16:22.497
My brother's dating my girlfriend's mom.

16:22.524 --> 16:23.983
Old Colt's doin' great!

16:25.109 --> 16:26.986
All right. You know what?

16:27.069 --> 16:29.113
I hope you are upset about
them gettin' engaged.

16:29.196 --> 16:30.406
Otherwise, you're just an asshole.

16:30.490 --> 16:32.617
I'm not upset.

16:32.700 --> 16:34.619
I swear, I'm just an asshole.

16:40.332 --> 16:43.085
Colt, wake up.

16:43.169 --> 16:44.958
Dad, wake up. Get your ass out of bed.

16:44.983 --> 16:45.945
This is not a drill.

16:47.006 --> 16:49.676
This better be North
Koreans, or I'm shooting you.

16:50.718 --> 16:53.220
What the hell? Is it fire or zombies?

16:53.304 --> 16:55.056
If Rooster got bit, don't
wait for him to turn.

16:55.139 --> 16:56.473
Just shoot him now!

16:58.893 --> 17:00.269
What are you doing sleeping
out on the porch?

17:00.352 --> 17:02.647
I don't like vomit in
my own bed, smart guy.

17:03.606 --> 17:04.732
This better be good.

17:04.816 --> 17:07.026
I was horseback
riding with Channing Tatum.

17:09.153 --> 17:10.863
Why'd you wake us up?

17:10.946 --> 17:13.119
Listen, "State of emergency declared

17:13.145 --> 17:15.141
after EPA spill in Animas River."

17:15.201 --> 17:16.828
Let me see that.

17:17.954 --> 17:19.204
I can't read that.

17:20.540 --> 17:21.624
Keep going.

17:21.708 --> 17:23.862
Uh, says the EPA was trying to reinforce

17:23.887 --> 17:25.777
the dam, and they screwed up and...

17:25.837 --> 17:27.334
they spilled a couple million gallons

17:27.358 --> 17:28.697
of poisonous sludge in the river.

17:28.756 --> 17:31.133
God, thousands of ranchers draw water

17:31.158 --> 17:32.659
from that Animas River.

17:32.719 --> 17:34.220
Those poor people.

17:34.303 --> 17:37.682
Damned disaster. Could be good for us.

17:37.765 --> 17:39.726
- I know, right?
- Yeah, it is.

17:40.643 --> 17:41.853
Why?

17:43.938 --> 17:45.320
Nobody's gonna buy their cattle

17:45.345 --> 17:46.547
off contaminated grounds.

17:46.608 --> 17:48.192
Yeah, of course.

17:49.861 --> 17:51.070
So?

17:52.488 --> 17:55.658
- So our calves are gonna be worth...
- A lot more money!

17:55.742 --> 17:57.619
Yeah, way ahead of you, Dad.

17:57.702 --> 18:00.788
That's a tough way to make
it but we need the money.

18:00.872 --> 18:02.707
This looks like a real mess.

18:02.790 --> 18:04.873
But, hey, we're
still gonna throw a party

18:04.898 --> 18:06.484
when we sell the calves, right?

18:06.543 --> 18:08.713
Oh, we'll do a little something.

18:10.131 --> 18:11.633
Man, we're gonna have money again.

18:11.716 --> 18:13.342
Hear that, little buddy?

18:13.425 --> 18:15.427
We're gonna fix you up real good.

18:17.013 --> 18:18.179
I'm gonna buy separate shampoo

18:18.204 --> 18:19.330
and conditioner.

18:19.390 --> 18:21.392
Fuck you, Pert Plus.

18:26.105 --> 18:29.358
Excuse me.

18:31.402 --> 18:33.445
Excuse me.

18:34.488 --> 18:36.824
I know we're all
having a good time, but...

18:36.908 --> 18:39.535
I'd like to take a minute and
acknowledge all the ranchers

18:39.619 --> 18:41.621
that are affected by the spill.

18:42.955 --> 18:44.749
Let's just be thankful we came down

18:44.774 --> 18:46.566
on the side of grace on this thing.

18:48.085 --> 18:51.005
Yeah, and hopefully, the EPA will
step up. But, in the meantime,

18:51.088 --> 18:53.540
10% of every drink
you buy over at my bar

18:53.565 --> 18:55.491
will go out to help these folks.

18:55.551 --> 18:58.054
Finally, reason to feel
good about my drinking.

19:00.222 --> 19:01.432
We don't pay.

19:01.515 --> 19:02.850
Shut up, Colt.

19:04.393 --> 19:06.395
Hey, Mom. This is Mary.

19:07.313 --> 19:08.856
Hi, Mary, nice to meet you.

19:08.940 --> 19:11.358
Hi, you, too. Your son is great.

19:11.442 --> 19:12.535
The son I'm dating.

19:12.560 --> 19:14.803
Not the son who's dating my daughter.

19:14.862 --> 19:16.698
He's... he's great, too.

19:16.781 --> 19:18.032
Small towns, huh?

19:20.409 --> 19:22.578
- Dad, you guys know each other.
- Hey, Mary.

19:22.662 --> 19:25.206
Yeah, between the Cracker
Barrel and the bowling team,

19:25.289 --> 19:26.412
first time I've ever seen you

19:26.437 --> 19:27.730
without your name on your shirt.

19:27.750 --> 19:30.878
- Oh.
- Wow, look at that tie.

19:30.962 --> 19:33.380
Yeah, just got it. Now I got three.

19:33.464 --> 19:36.425
One for funerals, court... and other.

19:38.135 --> 19:39.136
I might have mentioned

19:39.220 --> 19:40.930
- it's time to grow up a little.
- Well...

19:41.013 --> 19:43.265
Hey, then I'm already a fan of yours.

19:43.349 --> 19:45.027
Now, can you tell him that crumbs

19:45.052 --> 19:46.877
left in his beard are not leftovers?

19:46.936 --> 19:48.145
Ah...

19:48.229 --> 19:49.939
Don't you think he'd look
good without the beard?

19:50.022 --> 19:52.316
All right, you
guys are done talking.

19:54.443 --> 19:56.403
There's Abby and that little guy.

19:58.197 --> 20:01.033
His name is Kenny. You've
met him a dozen times.

20:01.117 --> 20:02.994
Don't care and won't remember.

20:04.286 --> 20:07.081
How you doin' there... Kenny?

20:07.164 --> 20:09.250
- Hey.
- Hey, Abby.

20:09.333 --> 20:11.210
- Sir.
- Congratulations, you two.

20:11.293 --> 20:12.586
Aw, we're really excited.

20:12.669 --> 20:15.339
Oh, come on, tell me the
story. How did he ask you?

20:15.422 --> 20:18.300
Oh, well, it's not the
most, uh, romantic place.

20:18.384 --> 20:19.635
We were at Cracker Barrel.

20:19.719 --> 20:22.013
Oh, well, who the hell am I to judge?

20:22.096 --> 20:24.590
Beau started his proposal to me with,

20:24.615 --> 20:26.124
"Oh, before I forget."

20:27.393 --> 20:30.772
Got the job done. Am I right... Kenny?

20:31.688 --> 20:34.275
- Yeah, Beau.
- Mr. Bennett will do.

20:34.358 --> 20:35.818
Yes, sir.

20:36.778 --> 20:38.780
You all have fun.

20:38.863 --> 20:40.907
Especially you... Kenny.

20:42.658 --> 20:45.702
Your ex-boyfriend's family's so cool.

20:45.787 --> 20:47.329
Yeah, they're great.

20:48.372 --> 20:50.750
I didn't even know Mr.
Bennett knew my name.

20:51.959 --> 20:53.294
It's awesome.

20:54.754 --> 20:57.882
- Hi, sweetie.
- Oh... hey, Mom.

20:57.965 --> 20:59.550
You know what, it's weird.

20:59.633 --> 21:02.053
I always thought you and
Abby would end up together.

21:03.220 --> 21:04.972
Yeah, well...

21:06.265 --> 21:07.391
shit happens.

21:08.434 --> 21:11.145
I also thought I'd have
four Super Bowl rings by now.

21:11.228 --> 21:12.897
Two MVPs.

21:12.980 --> 21:15.191
A Nationwide commercial.

21:15.274 --> 21:17.651
"Colt Bennett's
so damn handsome."

21:20.446 --> 21:22.907
It's okay to be upset about Abby.

21:24.033 --> 21:25.571
It's hard to shut the door on someone

21:25.596 --> 21:26.810
you've loved for a long time.

21:27.912 --> 21:29.831
But, darling, you don't
wanna miss what's right here

21:29.914 --> 21:32.333
because you can't let go of the past.

21:33.375 --> 21:34.877
I'm glad I've only had a six-pack.

21:34.902 --> 21:36.402
I'd like to remember some of that.

21:37.713 --> 21:39.342
Well, look who's here, Heather.

21:39.367 --> 21:41.574
You must not have screwed it up too bad.

21:43.052 --> 21:44.292
How'd you know I screwed it up?

21:44.303 --> 21:47.181
You, a girl... Just playin' the odds.

21:48.140 --> 21:49.558
That's fair.

21:49.641 --> 21:51.185
Got any motherly advice for me?

21:52.144 --> 21:53.624
Don't fuck it up again.

21:56.941 --> 21:58.609
- Hey.
- Hey.

22:02.238 --> 22:04.115
I'm... I'm really sorry.

22:05.116 --> 22:07.076
Yeah, you should be.

22:09.245 --> 22:10.371
I'm glad you came.

22:10.913 --> 22:13.415
I wasn't gonna miss
this over a little fight.

22:13.499 --> 22:15.420
Plus, my sister's kid was
having a tantrum and...

22:15.751 --> 22:17.752
I figured if I have to
deal with a screaming child,

22:17.753 --> 22:18.880
it might as well be you.

22:20.422 --> 22:22.133
You've got yourself
another country song.

22:22.216 --> 22:24.343
Look...

22:24.426 --> 22:26.303
I, uh...

22:27.513 --> 22:29.114
The thing with Abby caught me off guard.

22:30.432 --> 22:33.269
My feelings for her are all in the past.

22:34.561 --> 22:35.983
If you were around 15 years ago,

22:36.009 --> 22:37.964
maybe you'd have
been my first girlfriend.

22:38.024 --> 22:39.691
Hmm.

22:39.775 --> 22:41.860
Except, 15 years ago I was eight.

22:44.280 --> 22:46.657
Hey, math is still not my friend.

22:48.742 --> 22:51.787
- Look, neither one of us want drama so...
- Yes.

22:51.870 --> 22:53.664
Why don't we just start being
honest with each other?

22:53.747 --> 22:56.333
All right, agreed. Which reminds me...

22:57.334 --> 22:59.253
the other night, when you
were storming out of that bar...

22:59.336 --> 23:00.629
Mmm-hmm.

23:01.338 --> 23:02.423
I checked out your ass.

23:02.506 --> 23:04.841
- You're such an idiot.
- Yeah?

23:04.926 --> 23:06.677
Yeah.

23:06.760 --> 23:08.054
He's at the ten!

23:08.137 --> 23:11.682
He's at the five. Touchdown, Bennett!

23:11.765 --> 23:13.809
Kenny and Abby go wild.

23:15.394 --> 23:16.979
God, this family is cool.

23:17.604 --> 23:19.315
Do you think I should grow
a mustache like Mr. Bennett?

23:19.398 --> 23:20.566
No.

23:23.986 --> 23:26.530
Congratulations, Beau Bennett.

23:26.613 --> 23:28.032
It's good you trusted your gut.

23:28.115 --> 23:31.160
It just proves I should
never listen to anyone.

23:32.411 --> 23:34.746
Everything proves that to you.

23:36.498 --> 23:38.542
God, what a year, huh?

23:38.625 --> 23:40.544
Colt comes home...

23:40.627 --> 23:42.129
all of our rough spots...

23:43.339 --> 23:44.798
the ranch.

23:45.757 --> 23:47.468
Feels good to get a win.

23:47.551 --> 23:49.595
Well, you deserve it.

23:49.678 --> 23:52.806
We both deserve it.
It's your ranch, too.

23:52.889 --> 23:55.309
Oh, thanks for saying that.

23:56.810 --> 23:58.770
I love you, Mags.

23:59.396 --> 24:00.689
I love you, too.

24:02.108 --> 24:04.610
Hey, now that everything's
turned around, you know...

24:04.693 --> 24:06.612
all we have to do is fix our kids.

24:06.695 --> 24:07.989
What do you mean?

24:08.072 --> 24:09.920
Well, somebody's gotta make them

24:09.945 --> 24:11.849
into mature responsible adults.

24:11.908 --> 24:13.744
One miracle at a time.

24:16.288 --> 24:18.326
I think I'll go back to the Airstream

24:18.351 --> 24:20.066
and I'll get my stuff together.

24:20.126 --> 24:21.335
Need a hand?

24:21.418 --> 24:23.124
No, I... You got Rooster, and Colt,

24:23.149 --> 24:24.570
and a whole bunch of alcohol.

24:24.630 --> 24:26.540
Somebody better stay here and make sure

24:26.565 --> 24:27.949
the place doesn't burn down.

24:33.805 --> 24:35.182
You're all right, Hank?

24:36.600 --> 24:37.893
Been better.

24:38.935 --> 24:41.605
I lost my job at the EPA today.

24:44.983 --> 24:47.444
Man, that was a fun day.

24:47.528 --> 24:51.782
Yeah... we deserve
it after such a shit year.

24:52.616 --> 24:54.785
It wasn't that bad. You
know, I came home this year.

24:54.868 --> 24:57.079
I said what I said.

24:58.997 --> 25:01.333
I don't understand why we're
wastin' time talking to each other

25:01.417 --> 25:04.586
when we can be inside making
quality time with the new TV.

25:07.256 --> 25:09.550
You know, I ask an
awful lot of you boys.

25:10.759 --> 25:13.262
Fact is...

25:13.345 --> 25:14.888
I couldn't have done it without you.

25:17.558 --> 25:19.017
Thank you.

25:20.227 --> 25:22.854
Beau Bennett... best
rancher in the state.

25:22.938 --> 25:24.273
Mmm-hmm.

25:30.362 --> 25:33.657
- It tastes different.
- It's the good stuff, that's why.

25:35.576 --> 25:37.703
Nah, it ain't the whiskey.

25:38.620 --> 25:40.122
I mean drinking while happy.

25:41.790 --> 25:43.500
I got something for you.

25:54.052 --> 25:55.346
My championship ring?

25:56.305 --> 25:57.306
Oh, that's cool.

25:57.389 --> 25:58.891
Fifteen years of free
labor, I never abandoned you,

25:58.974 --> 26:00.559
I don't need nothing.

26:04.480 --> 26:05.647
Dad...

26:07.233 --> 26:08.359
you didn't have to do this.

26:09.693 --> 26:12.363
I know the calf sale went
well and all, but...

26:12.446 --> 26:14.367
you shouldn't be throwing
around this much money.

26:15.991 --> 26:18.202
All right, I wasn't
gonna say this but...

26:18.285 --> 26:21.622
the guy at the pawn shop
threw that in with the TV.

26:24.666 --> 26:26.960
I'm just kidding you. I paid for it.

26:28.003 --> 26:30.256
But it was heavily discounted.

26:33.091 --> 26:34.593
Where are you goin'?

26:35.844 --> 26:37.346
Goin' to help your mom.

26:38.805 --> 26:40.891
Hey, we're
happy she's moving back in.

26:40.974 --> 26:43.101
Yep, really happy for you, Dad.

26:49.400 --> 26:51.058
All right, he's gone.
Let's go watch TV.

26:51.083 --> 26:51.634
Yep.

26:57.324 --> 26:58.700
- Hey, Maria.
- Hey, Beau.

26:58.784 --> 27:00.911
- Maggie around?
- No, she left a while ago.

27:00.994 --> 27:01.995
She told me to close up.

27:02.078 --> 27:03.622
- All right, thanks.
- Mmm-hmm.

27:35.070 --> 27:38.324
Well, that's gotta be a new
record for breaking a TV.

27:38.407 --> 27:41.327
Well, if someone would
learn how to catch a ball.

27:41.410 --> 27:42.659
Well, maybe you should've taken that

27:42.684 --> 27:43.561
Orlando quarterback's arm

27:43.620 --> 27:44.871
instead of his girlfriend.

27:46.748 --> 27:48.917
If the ball hits your
hands, you make the catch!

27:52.379 --> 27:53.422
That Abby?

27:54.340 --> 27:56.258
Yeah... the hell does she want?

27:57.175 --> 27:58.510
Probably me.

28:03.014 --> 28:05.351
Sorry, Abby, I'm taken.

28:06.435 --> 28:08.395
- Hey, Ab.
- Hey.

28:08.479 --> 28:11.106
Hey... you notice anything?

28:11.189 --> 28:13.442
Yeah, it's the new tie.

28:15.486 --> 28:16.862
Can I, uh, talk to you, Colt?

28:16.945 --> 28:18.739
If you're looking for a
compliment on those bangs,

28:18.822 --> 28:20.324
you can keep on waiting.

28:23.994 --> 28:26.330
So your truck stopped
making that noise, huh?

28:29.333 --> 28:31.167
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

28:32.753 --> 28:35.839
- You want something to drink?
- Uh...

28:35.922 --> 28:38.174
Nah. Nah, thank you.

28:38.259 --> 28:39.551
Suit yourself.

28:42.178 --> 28:43.419
What do you want to talk about?

28:45.181 --> 28:46.517
I'm not really sure.

28:50.229 --> 28:52.063
It's just, uh... you ever, um...

28:53.064 --> 28:54.865
think about where you're
gonna be in 20 years?

28:57.903 --> 28:59.905
Probably sitting on this porch...

28:59.988 --> 29:02.699
watching Rooster and Mary's
kids play with my kids...

29:04.034 --> 29:05.867
who are also cousins and brothers

29:05.892 --> 29:07.562
and sisters and her grandkids.

29:10.999 --> 29:14.336
Sorry... I don't know why I came here.

29:16.505 --> 29:17.548
What do you mean?

29:18.590 --> 29:21.092
I was just driving around and...

29:21.176 --> 29:23.929
I'm not even
sure where I was going but...

29:25.681 --> 29:26.890
I ended up here.

29:27.808 --> 29:29.100
Hmm.

29:31.645 --> 29:32.854
You all right?

29:34.273 --> 29:35.816
Yeah, I'm fine.

29:36.858 --> 29:38.193
But...

29:39.778 --> 29:41.237
I keep...

29:43.156 --> 29:44.757
gettin' all these pictures in my head...

29:46.285 --> 29:48.954
of where I'm gonna
be in 20 years and, uh...

29:53.417 --> 29:54.585
And?

29:56.712 --> 29:59.465
I'm not sure Kenny's the
one I'm supposed to marry.
