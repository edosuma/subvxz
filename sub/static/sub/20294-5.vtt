03:03.100 --> 03:04.867
DO YOU NEED ANY
MEDICAL ATTENTION RIGHT NOW?

03:04.967 --> 03:06.600
LISTEN, DO YOU NEED
AN AMBULANCE TO COME HERE?

03:06.700 --> 03:08.467
-I WANT TO KNOW--
HE'S ON SOME KIND
OF MEDICATION.

03:08.567 --> 03:10.733
-MA'AM, JUST GIVE ME A SECOND.
-I'M HIS MOTHER.

03:10.833 --> 03:12.967
-I AM IN SO MUCH
PAIN RIGHT NOW.
-THAT'S WHAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT.

03:13.067 --> 03:15.367
THAT'S THE MAIN THING
I'M WORRIED ABOUT.
-YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW-- OW!

03:15.467 --> 03:17.100
-LISTEN, WHAT'S
YOUR FIRST NAME?
-OW!

03:17.200 --> 03:18.500
-WHAT'S HIS FIRST NAME?

03:18.600 --> 03:21.233
-IT'S (bleep) HURTS, DAMMIT!
-TRAVIS... ALL RIGHT.

03:21.333 --> 03:23.100
-LISTEN, WE'RE GONNA
WALK OVER HERE.
-(screaming)

03:23.200 --> 03:25.133
-TRAVIS GET UP.
YOU'RE NOT DOING THAT.

03:25.233 --> 03:26.800
-IT HURTS DAMMIT!

03:26.900 --> 03:28.167
-WHEN WE ROLLED UP,
YOU WERE FIGHTING

03:28.267 --> 03:30.067
ON THE GROUND
WITH SOMEBODY--
WHO WAS THAT GUY?

03:30.100 --> 03:31.267
-THAT WAS MY COUSIN.

03:31.367 --> 03:33.067
HE WAS TRYING
TO RESTRAIN ME.

03:33.133 --> 03:34.700
MY MOM'S BOYFRIEND
THOUGHT I ROBBED HIM

03:34.800 --> 03:36.433
AND I DIDN'T.
-OKAY.

03:36.533 --> 03:38.067
-NO I DIDN'T.
-SO THEY THOUGHT...

03:38.167 --> 03:40.233
SO THEY WERE FALSE
ACCUSING YOU OF SOMETHING,

03:40.333 --> 03:42.433
YOU GOT UPSET,
GOT A LITTLE EMOTIONAL.

03:42.533 --> 03:44.800
AND THEN THAT'S WHEN
THE BRAWL KIND OF HAPPENED
BETWEEN YOUR COUSIN?

03:44.900 --> 03:48.067
-YEAH. HE CAME OVER HERE
AND THEN HE GOT ME
IN A CHOKEHOLD.

03:48.100 --> 03:49.233
I COULDN'T BREATHE.

03:49.333 --> 03:52.533
AND I WAS SCREAMING
BECAUSE I COULDN'T BREATHE.

03:52.633 --> 03:54.567
-THE ONLY ISSUE THAT
I'M CONCERNED ABOUT

03:54.667 --> 03:57.067
IS MY PARTNER
AND I WERE STANDING
OVER YOU GUYS

03:57.100 --> 03:58.800
FOR A FEW MINUTES...
-I DIDN'T KNOW. I DIDN'T KNOW...

03:58.900 --> 04:00.533
AND WE WERE-- IDENTIFIED
OURSELVES AND WERE LIKE,

04:00.633 --> 04:02.067
"ALL RIGHT. KNOCK IT OFF.
IF WE LET HIM UP,

04:02.133 --> 04:03.867
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE COOL.
WE'RE GOING TO BE COOL."

04:03.967 --> 04:06.067
YOU SAID, "BRING IT!"
GOT UP...

04:06.167 --> 04:07.767
START THROWING US AROUND...
-THAT'S BECAUSE...

04:07.867 --> 04:09.433
-YOU HAD TO GET TAKEN
TO THE GROUND,

04:09.533 --> 04:10.867
AND THAT'S WHY
YOU'RE IN CUFFS RIGHT NOW.

04:10.967 --> 04:12.467
I'M JUST TRYING--
-I DIDN'T KNOW
IT WAS YOU GUYS.

04:12.567 --> 04:13.867
I MEAN, I DIDN'T
HEAR NO SIRENS.
-OKAY.

04:13.967 --> 04:15.767
-I DIDN'T SEE NO LIGHTS
PULL UP OR NOTHING.

04:15.867 --> 04:17.233
I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS YOU GUYS.
-ALL RIGHT.

04:17.333 --> 04:18.333
WELL HERE'S
THE AMBULANCE NOW

04:18.433 --> 04:19.833
SO YOU CAN TELL THEM
WHERE YOUR PAIN IS.

04:19.933 --> 04:21.600
-YOU FIGHT WITH YOUR MOM,

04:21.700 --> 04:23.433
YOU'RE MANHANDLING
YOUR MOM AND STUFF...

04:23.533 --> 04:25.067
-NO...
-NO?

04:25.167 --> 04:27.167
WHY DOES SHE HAVE
ALL THESE MARKS ON HER THEN?

04:27.267 --> 04:29.167
-NO 'CAUSE SHE-- SHE HAD
A LIGHT IN HER HAND.

04:29.267 --> 04:31.400
AND I WAS-- I ASKED HER
IF I COULD USE A LIGHT, PLEASE.

04:31.500 --> 04:34.200
AND SHE SAID NO, SO I TRIED
TO SNATCH IT OUT OF HER HAND

04:34.300 --> 04:37.300
'CAUSE I REALLY NEEDED A LIGHT
'CAUSE I REALLY NEEDED TO LOOK
FOR SOMETHING.

04:37.400 --> 04:39.567
AND I ACCIDENTALLY
HIT HER ELBOW.

04:39.667 --> 04:41.233
AND THEN SHE'S LIKE,
"GET THE (bleep) UP."

04:41.333 --> 04:43.567
SHE WAS LIKE,
"GET THE 'F' OFF ME,
GET THE 'F' OFF ME."

04:43.667 --> 04:44.900
-WHAT KIND OF LIGHT?
LIKE A LIGHTER?

04:45.067 --> 04:46.700
-HUH? NO LIKE...
LIKE A FLASHLIGHT.

04:46.800 --> 04:48.767
-OKAY.
-'CAUSE WE DON'T HAVE
NO POWER IN THE HOUSE.

04:48.867 --> 04:50.933
-HEY, TYLER.
-YEAH?

04:51.067 --> 04:53.367
-TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED
FROM WHEN YOU SHOWED
UP TILL I SHOWED UP.

04:53.467 --> 04:56.100
-BASICALLY HIS MOM
TOLD ME TO...

04:56.200 --> 04:58.500
-WHOSE MOM?
-TRAVIS'S MOM TOLD ME TO...

04:58.600 --> 05:00.733
SHE JUST WALKED IN THE HOUSE
AND I JUST GOT HOME.
-OKAY.

05:00.833 --> 05:02.633
-AND SHE SAID "TRAVIS IS GOING
CRAZY. HE'S ON SOMETHING."

05:02.733 --> 05:05.400
SO I RAN OVER HERE
AND HE GOT REALLY ANGRY.

05:05.500 --> 05:07.200
I JUST PUT HIM ON THE GROUND
AND DETAINED HIM.

05:07.300 --> 05:09.267
-YOU WERE THE ONE DETAINING
HIM BEFORE WE GOT HERE? OKAY.

05:09.367 --> 05:11.300
-JEREMIAH!
-HE'S RUNNING.

05:11.400 --> 05:13.367
STOP! STOP RUNNING!

05:13.467 --> 05:15.300
-OW!

05:15.400 --> 05:17.900
OW! WHY DID YOU HIT
ME IN THE FACE?

05:18.067 --> 05:21.133
OW! WHY DID
YOU HIT ME IN THE FACE?

05:21.233 --> 05:23.233
-WHY'D YOU PUSH AWAY?
-OW!

05:23.333 --> 05:25.667
-I'M ON METH...
-WE DON'T CARE, TRAVIS.

05:25.767 --> 05:29.300
-I'M (bleep) UP.

05:29.400 --> 05:31.067
-STAND UP.
-I'M (bleep) UP.

05:31.167 --> 05:32.600
-MEDICS ARE CHECKING
THE GUY OUT...

05:32.700 --> 05:35.433
WHILE THEY'RE CHECKING HIM OUT,
HE TAKES FLIGHT.

05:35.533 --> 05:37.100
UM, COMPLAINING ABOUT
A SHATTERED KNEECAP.

05:37.200 --> 05:38.500
OBVIOUSLY NOT SHATTERED
WHEN HE RUNS.

05:38.600 --> 05:40.967
UH, CONSISTENT BEHAVIOR, SO...
-YEAH.

05:41.067 --> 05:44.433
-WELL, TO ME, I INSTANTLY
KNEW THAT HE WAS ON SOMETHING.

05:44.533 --> 05:46.333
-OKAY.
-I MEAN I LOVE HIM
AND HE LOVES ME TO DEATH.

05:46.433 --> 05:48.267
AND AFTER HE REALIZED
HE HIT ME,

05:48.367 --> 05:50.867
HE... HE JUST STARTED
CRYING AND FREAKING OUT.

05:50.967 --> 05:52.967
-OKAY.
-AND I MEAN, EVEN THOUGH...

05:53.067 --> 05:54.567
-AND WHERE DID HE HIT YOU?
CAN YOU EXPLAIN?

05:54.667 --> 05:57.367
-LIKE DESCRIBE IT
A LITTLE BIT TO ME?
-HE COME AT ME LIKE A HUGE RAGE.

05:57.467 --> 05:59.367
-YEAH?
-AND WHEN HE HIT ME HERE,

05:59.467 --> 06:01.067
HE KNEW I'D...
-DID YOU FALL BACK?

06:01.133 --> 06:03.667
-OH, NO. I WENT TO FALL BACK
BUT THEN I PUSHED HIM BACK.

06:03.767 --> 06:04.700
-OKAY.
-I WAS LIKE, "C'MON BOY.

06:04.800 --> 06:06.167
YOU GONNA GO?
LET'S GO."

06:06.267 --> 06:07.733
-YEAH. YOU'RE MAMA.
YOU GOTTA PROTECT YOURSELF.
I GOTCHA.

06:07.833 --> 06:09.533
-AND HE COME-- HE COME
BACK AT ME AGAIN

06:09.633 --> 06:11.767
AND I'M LIKE, "OH MY GOD.
ARE FOR REAL? YOU'RE GONNA
HIT ME AGAIN?"

06:11.867 --> 06:14.067
-OKAY. YEAH. OH OKAY.
-"HIT ME AGAIN!"

06:14.167 --> 06:16.100
-ALL RIGHT.
SO THEN HE HITS YOU,

06:16.200 --> 06:18.733
AND THAT'S WHEN YOUR--
HIS COUSIN, THE BIG GUY...

06:18.833 --> 06:21.700
-YUP. I TOLD HIM,
"MAN, YOU GOTTA COME AND GET
TRAVIS. HE'S RAGING RIGHT NOW."

06:21.800 --> 06:24.433
-OKAY. SO THAT'S WHEN
TYLER CAME IN AND HELPED
OUT WITH TRAVIS.

06:24.533 --> 06:25.667
-TYLER.
-AND WE PULLED UP.

06:25.767 --> 06:28.067
AND HE COMES AFTER US.
-RIGHT.

06:28.100 --> 06:30.233
-ULTIMATELY HE'S FAILING
TO OBEY OUR LAWFUL COMMANDS,

06:30.333 --> 06:32.167
WHICH IS WHY HE WAS
TAKEN TO THE GROUND.

06:32.267 --> 06:34.267
OKAY. I GOTCHA. ALL RIGHT.
-I THOUGHT TYLER WOULD
LET HIM UP.

06:34.367 --> 06:35.967
-TYLER WOULD HAVE TO...
HE'S LIKE, "C'MON!" HE'S...

06:36.067 --> 06:38.633
YOU KNOW, TYLER IS TELLING HIM,
"I'M A LOT STRONGER
THAN YOU ARE.

06:38.733 --> 06:40.900
AND I COULD DO
THIS ALL DAY."
-OKAY.

06:41.067 --> 06:43.633
-WELL OBVIOUSLY I KNOW
YOU'RE A MOM AND PARENT.

06:43.733 --> 06:46.133
AND CHILDREN ACT
OUT SOMETIMES,
BUT IT'S NEVER RIGHT.

06:46.233 --> 06:49.100
HE'S ESSENTIALLY A GROWN MAN
AND HE'S GOING TO JAIL TONIGHT.

06:49.200 --> 06:50.833
HE'S GOING TO JAIL
FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE,

06:50.933 --> 06:53.767
AND HE'S GOING TO JAIL
FOR OBSTRUCTION, OKAY?

06:56.100 --> 06:57.467
-I'M NOT ORIGINALLY
FROM FLORIDA.

06:57.567 --> 06:58.700
I ACTUALLY GREW
UP IN TEXAS.

06:58.800 --> 06:59.767
BUT I'VE BEEN HERE IN FLORIDA

06:59.867 --> 07:02.100
FOR THE PAST
13 YEARS OR SO.

07:02.200 --> 07:04.500
IN TEXAS THERE WASN'T
REALLY A LOT TO DO.

07:04.600 --> 07:06.767
IT WAS A SMALLER TOWN
AND A LOT OF DESERTS,

07:06.867 --> 07:08.100
NOT A LOT OF WATER.

07:08.200 --> 07:09.933
HERE IT'S A NICE
CHANGE OF PACE

07:10.067 --> 07:12.467
'CAUSE WE HAVE BEACHES
AND IT'S GOOD TO SPEND TIME

07:12.567 --> 07:14.400
OVER AT THE BEACH
WITH THE FAMILY.

07:14.500 --> 07:17.267
ALL RIGHT WE'RE GONNA ASSIST
MY ZONE PARTNER OVER HERE

07:17.367 --> 07:19.333
ON A TRAFFIC STOP.
HE JUST PULLED OVER
THIS VEHICLE.

07:19.433 --> 07:21.367
SO WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD
AND SEE WHAT HE'S GOT.

07:27.133 --> 07:29.667
-SWERVING BACK THERE...
-YEAH, I WAS LOST.

07:29.767 --> 07:31.367
-OKAY.

THIS SIDE OR THE AREA.

07:31.467 --> 07:33.767
AND SHE TOLD
ME TO TAKE HANCOCK.

07:33.867 --> 07:35.767
AND I'M LIKE, "OKAY."
-THIS IS YOUR CAR?

07:35.867 --> 07:37.967

-AND MA'AM, DO YOU HAVE

07:41.233 --> 07:42.700
CAN YOU ROLL THIS DOWN?

07:42.800 --> 07:44.267
-THE WINDOW DOESN'T GO DOWN.

07:44.367 --> 07:46.133
-YOU BOUGHT A CAR
THAT WINDOW DOESN'T GO DOWN?

07:46.233 --> 07:47.500
-YEAH. (laughs)

07:49.233 --> 07:51.100
-DO YOU HAVE
AN I.D. AT ALL?

07:51.200 --> 07:52.333
-(indistinct muttering)

07:52.433 --> 07:53.800
-SHE DOESN'T HAVE
AN I.D. OR ANYTHING

07:53.900 --> 07:55.867
WITH HER NAME ON IT
IN HER PURSE THAT'S
RIGHT NEXT TO HER?

07:55.967 --> 07:57.633
-UM...

07:57.733 --> 08:00.500
ANGELA, THAT'S YOUR PURSE
RIGHT THERE, RIGHT?

08:00.600 --> 08:02.067
-SO WHERE ARE YOU ALL
COMING FROM?

08:02.100 --> 08:03.733
I MISSED THE WHOLE
FIRST PART OF THE CONVERSATION.

08:03.833 --> 08:04.833
-...MY MOM STAYS
ON EPSON DRIVE.

08:04.933 --> 08:06.433

08:17.800 --> 08:19.333
OH OKAY.
-MM-MM.

08:29.267 --> 08:30.700

08:30.800 --> 08:32.333
-DO YOU... DID YOU GUYS

08:32.433 --> 08:34.733
EARLIER IN THE CAR
OR SOMETHING?
OR DO YOU EVER?

08:34.833 --> 08:36.400
DID YOU GET IN THE CAR
AND SMOKE IT?
-NO, I DIDN'T.

08:36.500 --> 08:38.800
NO. I GOT IT BRAND NEW
JUST YESTERDAY.

08:38.900 --> 08:40.367
-OKAY.
-LIKE LITERALLY JUST YESTERDAY.

08:40.467 --> 08:41.967
AND I TOLD THEM
WHAT WAS WRONG

08:42.067 --> 08:44.133
WITH IT AND WHAT-- WHY
IT WAS SMELLING LIKE THAT.

08:44.233 --> 08:45.667
-IT SMELLS LIKE WEED
IN THE CAR.
-YEAH.

08:45.767 --> 08:47.567
YEAH. I CAN SMELL IT...
THAT'S ALL I'M ASKING.
-THEY TOLD ME--

08:47.667 --> 08:50.067
THEY JUST TOLD ME...
-SO YOU BOUGHT
THE CAR LIKE THAT?

08:50.100 --> 08:52.233
-YEAH. I JUST...
-YOU BOUGHT THE CAR
WITH THE MARIJUANA SMELL IN IT?

08:52.333 --> 08:54.333
-I HAD JUST-- THAT'S WHY
I'M GOING TO MY MOM'S HOUSE,

08:54.433 --> 08:55.733

AND EVERYTHING.

08:55.833 --> 08:57.200
-SO YOU'RE GONNA

-YEAH. EVERYTHING.

08:57.300 --> 08:58.600
-HERE'S WHAT I WANNA DO.
I WANNA MAKE SURE

08:58.700 --> 09:00.367
I'M REAL HONEST WITH YOU.
I WANT NOTHING MORE THAN

09:00.467 --> 09:02.167
YOU TO GET BACK IN YOUR CAR
AND GO TO YOUR MOM'S HOUSE

09:02.267 --> 09:03.900
AND I'LL GIVE

-OKAY. THANK YOU.

09:04.067 --> 09:05.233
-BUT BEFORE THAT
I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT

09:05.333 --> 09:06.533
YOU NEED TO BE
HONEST WITH ME.

09:06.633 --> 09:08.233
AM I GONNA FIND ANYTHING
WHEN I GO THROUGH THIS CAR?

09:08.333 --> 09:09.733
-NO.
-FACE THE CAR.

09:09.833 --> 09:11.633
JUST GONNA PAT YOU DOWN
FOR WEAPONS REAL QUICK.
ALL RIGHT?

09:11.733 --> 09:14.400
-ALL RIGHT. NO.
-NO KNIVES, NO WEAPONS, RIGHT?

09:14.500 --> 09:16.233
ALL RIGHT, MAN.
I APPRECIATE IT.

09:16.333 --> 09:19.233
WHY DON'T YOU COME BACK
OVER HERE WITH MY PARTNER
REAL QUICK AND YOUR GIRLFRIEND?

09:21.967 --> 09:24.633
ALL RIGHT. WE REMOVED
ALL OCCUPANTS OF THE VEHICLE

09:24.733 --> 09:27.267
DUE TO THE STRONG
ODOR OF MARIJUANA

09:27.367 --> 09:28.567
COMING FROM THE VEHICLE.

09:28.667 --> 09:30.467
THEY ALL SAID THAT THEY JUST
PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE.

09:30.567 --> 09:33.367
HEY BUBLEY,
THERE'S A SIGNAL ZERO

09:33.467 --> 09:35.233
IN THE CENTER,
JUST SO YOU KNOW.

09:37.667 --> 09:39.633
THERE'S ALSO A BAG.

09:41.267 --> 09:43.400
IT SAYS "WHOLE LEAF TOBACCO."

09:49.400 --> 09:51.300
AND THAT'S GONNA BE
WHERE THE STRONG ODOR

09:51.400 --> 09:52.600
OF THE MARIJUANA
IS COMING FROM.

09:52.700 --> 09:53.767
-Police radio: 24-34.

09:53.867 --> 09:56.800
-LOOKS LIKE MAYBE SOME
CRACK COCAINE AS WELL.

09:56.900 --> 09:59.867
-(police radio chatter)
-YOU'RE SAYING THAT
YOU JUST BOUGHT A CAR

10:00.067 --> 10:03.400
THAT SMELLS LIKE WEED
AND HAS A GUN IN IT RANDOMLY,

10:03.500 --> 10:04.867
AND I'M JUST
CONFUSED ON THAT.

10:04.967 --> 10:06.900
SO FOR OUR SAFETY,
WE'RE JUST GONNA FIGURE
IT OUT TOGETHER.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.133
-NO PROBLEM, SIR. YEAH.
-YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

10:09.233 --> 10:11.967
ALL RIGHT?
-CAN I PULL UP
MY PANTS A LITTLE BIT?

10:12.067 --> 10:13.833
-YEAH, I'LL PULL
THEM UP FOR YOU.

10:13.933 --> 10:15.033
-APPRECIATE IT.

10:15.133 --> 10:16.500
-EVERYONE'S SAYING
THAT NO ONE KNOWS ANYTHING?

10:16.600 --> 10:17.900
-NO. I'M NOT SAYING
THAT I DON'T KNOW.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.667
-I DON'T KNOW THAT...
-YOU'RE GIVING ME A WEDGIE.

10:19.767 --> 10:22.000
-YOU GOT A WEDGIE?
TAKE A SEAT REAL QUICK
ON THE GROUND.

10:22.100 --> 10:24.067
SIT DOWN. SIT...
SIT RIGHT ON YOUR BUTT.

10:25.367 --> 10:27.167
BUBLEY, CHECK HIS MOUTH.

10:32.533 --> 10:34.333
-THERE IT IS.
SPIT IT OUT.

10:34.433 --> 10:35.933
-SPIT IT OUT.

10:37.867 --> 10:39.867
-OPEN YOUR MOUTH AGAIN.

10:41.300 --> 10:42.933
THAT'S ALL YOU HAD IN THERE?
-YEAH.

10:43.033 --> 10:44.700
-YOU SWALLOWED IT?
-NO. I AIN'T EVEN

10:44.800 --> 10:46.700
-ALL RIGHT. STAND UP.

10:46.800 --> 10:48.100
-Woman:
I AIN'T GOT NOTHING ON ME.

10:49.500 --> 10:51.633
HOW DID MY PARTNER KNOW
THAT YOU HAD IT
IN YOUR MOUTH?

10:51.733 --> 10:54.467
-NO, BECAUSE I WAS LEAVING
THE STORE BUT...

10:54.567 --> 10:56.800
I DON'T GOT NOTHING ON ME.
-IT REEKS...

10:56.900 --> 10:58.233
-NO, THAT AIN'T EVEN MINE.

10:58.333 --> 11:01.067
-WHAT IS THIS THING FOR?
-OH THAT'S MY GOOD LUCK CHARM.

11:01.100 --> 11:02.633
-GOOD LUCK CHARM?
WELL, IT'S NOT GOOD LUCK IF...

11:02.733 --> 11:04.433
-YO, I AIN'T GOT NOTHING ON ME.
-GOT CAUGHT WITH A GUN

11:04.533 --> 11:06.133
AND SOME MARIJUANA.
-NO. THAT AIN'T EVEN MINE.

11:06.233 --> 11:08.833
-WELL HOW COME WHEN WE SAID,
"DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING BAD
OR ON YOU,

11:08.933 --> 11:11.067
GUNS, DRUGS, OR WEAPONS,"
YOU DIDN'T SAY NOTHING?

11:11.100 --> 11:13.333
-OH 'CAUSE...
IN MY MOUTH?

11:13.433 --> 11:16.067
-YEAH. I SAID,
"DO YOU HAVE ANY
GUNS, DRUGS, OR WEAPONS,"

11:16.133 --> 11:19.200
-AND YOU SAID...
-I AIN'T GOT THAT SHIT
ON ME, SO I'M GOOD...

11:19.300 --> 11:21.900
-NO, THAT WAS...
THE GUY WHO JUST FINISHED.

11:22.067 --> 11:24.067
I JUST CAME FROM THE STORE
BUT I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING THAT--

11:24.133 --> 11:25.933
YOU WOULD HAVE
SMELT IT ON ME, LIKE HONEST.

11:26.067 --> 11:27.467
-I DID SMELL IT ON YOU.
THAT'S WHY WE ASKED

11:27.567 --> 11:29.400
TO LOOK THROUGH
YOUR MOUTH-- I CAN SMELL IT
RIGHT AROUND HERE.

11:29.500 --> 11:31.167
-YO, BUDDY. YO,
THAT AIN'T MINE.

11:31.267 --> 11:33.667
-ALL RIGHT. TAKE A SEAT
RIGHT THERE, JUST HANG OUT
AND STAY COOPERATIVE.

11:33.767 --> 11:35.667
ANGELA, RIGHT?
-YES.

11:35.767 --> 11:36.733
-PLEASE STAND UP.

11:36.833 --> 11:38.067
WE'RE JUST TRYING
TO GET TO THE BOTTOM

11:38.100 --> 11:39.433
OF WHAT'S GOING ON.
ALL RIGHT?

11:39.533 --> 11:41.133
WHY WERE YOU
IN THE CAR WITH THEM?

11:41.233 --> 11:42.867
-SHE WAS GIVING ME A RIDE.
-FROM WHERE?

11:42.967 --> 11:44.700
-UH, I WAS IN FORT MEYERS.

11:44.800 --> 11:46.367
AND THE CAR
I WAS IN STOPPED WORKING,

11:46.467 --> 11:48.367
SO I CALLED HER,
SHE CAME AND GOT ME,

11:48.467 --> 11:50.933
AND SHE WAS GOING TO TAKE
ME TO GO GET... SOMETHING.

11:51.067 --> 11:52.367
-DRUGS?
-YEAH.

11:52.467 --> 11:53.500
AND DROP ME OFF.
-OKAY.

11:53.600 --> 11:55.067
SO SHE WAS LITERALLY
JUST DRIVING YOU TO GO

11:55.133 --> 11:57.100
PICK UP SOME DRUGS AND...
-WELL, SHE GOT
TO GO SEE SOMEBODY.

11:57.200 --> 11:58.367

11:58.467 --> 11:59.833
-OKAY.

-YEAH.
-OKAY. SO YOU WERE JUST
GOING TO BUY SOME DRUGS

12:03.300 --> 12:04.700

12:04.800 --> 12:06.367
-YEAH. THAT'S ALL I--
-SO WHAT WAS THE GUN FOR?

12:06.467 --> 12:07.967
-I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.

12:08.067 --> 12:09.267
I DIDN'T KNOW
THAT WAS IN THE CAR.

12:09.367 --> 12:11.400
I'M IN THE BACK SEAT
SITTING THERE, TWIRLING,

12:11.500 --> 12:13.800
WAITING TO GET SOME DOPE
'CAUSE I HAVEN'T HAD DOPE ALL...

12:13.900 --> 12:15.800

WHY DON'T YOU COME CLEAN
ABOUT EVERYTHING I HEARD?

12:23.267 --> 12:25.800
-WHOSE GUN IS IT?
-IT'S MY BOYFRIEND'S GUN.

12:25.900 --> 12:27.300
-IT'S YOUR BOYFRIEND'S GUN?

12:27.400 --> 12:28.733
-YES, SIR.
-OKAY.

12:28.833 --> 12:30.867
DID HE GET IT
FROM ANYWHERE IN PARTICULAR?

12:30.967 --> 12:32.933
DID HE BUY IT?
DID SOMEONE GIVE IT TO HIM?

12:33.067 --> 12:35.233
SOMEBODY BOUGHT IT.
HE BOUGHT IT FROM SOMEBODY

12:35.333 --> 12:37.200
THAT I DID KNOW--
HIS COUSIN.

12:37.300 --> 12:38.833
-HE BOUGHT IT FROM HIS COUSIN?
-YES.

12:38.933 --> 12:40.767
-OKAY. WHAT ABOUT
ALL THE DRUGS?

12:40.867 --> 12:42.267

BUY THE DRUGS?

12:42.367 --> 12:43.700
-SHE DID.
-SHE DID?

12:43.800 --> 12:45.267
-I DIDN'T-- I DIDN'T
HAVE NOTHING,

12:45.367 --> 12:47.067
NO PART IN BUYING
NO DRUGS OR NOTHING.

12:47.167 --> 12:48.600
-HOW COME YOUR BOYFRIEND
HAD THE GUN?

12:48.700 --> 12:50.433
WAS IT 'CAUSE HE'S SCARED
WHENEVER HE COMES OVER HERE

12:50.533 --> 12:52.367
TO BUY DRUGS?
-HE HAD CAME...

12:52.467 --> 12:55.867
HE WENT TO GO GET
THE GUN OR WHATEVER,

12:55.967 --> 12:59.233
BECAUSE WE WERE
IN THE CAR WITH HER
IN THE KNIGHTS INN.

12:59.333 --> 13:02.100
AND SHE WAS GONNA
GIVE THE GUN TO HER.

13:02.200 --> 13:03.800
-OKAY.
-SO THAT SHE FEELS SAFE.

13:03.900 --> 13:05.833
-ALL RIGHT.

MY BABY MAMA'S GOING
TO PRISON, RIGHT?

13:13.200 --> 13:15.467
-SHE IS A REGISTERED FELON,
IT'S HER VEHICLE,

13:15.567 --> 13:17.667

13:17.767 --> 13:19.300
-I ALREADY KNOW THE STORY.
THEY ALREADY TOLD ME.

13:19.400 --> 13:20.400
YOU GOT IT

13:20.500 --> 13:21.733
THEY SAID YOU GUYS
WERE COMING OVER HERE

13:21.833 --> 13:22.800
TO BUY DRUGS,

13:22.900 --> 13:24.167
YOU LIKE TO HAVE
THE FIREARM FOR YOU

13:24.267 --> 13:26.233
FOR PROTECTION,
WHICH I KIND OF UNDERSTAND.

13:26.333 --> 13:27.733

13:27.833 --> 13:29.233
TONIGHT FOR THE POSSESSION

13:30.400 --> 13:31.800
THAT WAS

13:31.900 --> 13:33.600
AND FOR THE MARIJUANA
THAT YOU HAD IN YOUR MOUTH.

13:36.367 --> 13:37.667
-WELL, I'VE BEEN

PILLS ORIENTED.

14:05.200 --> 14:07.067
-SHE CAME INTO MY ROOM--

-HE'S TRYING TO SAY
I WENT IN THERE

14:10.067 --> 14:11.667
AND TOOK SOMETHING,

14:11.767 --> 14:14.433
-SHE'S COMING INTO MY ROOM...
-AND THIS LITTLE SKANKY THING

14:14.533 --> 14:16.633
-I SAID, "STAY OUT OF MY ROOM."
-WHY DON'T YOU GO

OF THE ROAD.

14:26.267 --> 14:28.333
WHAT'S...
WHAT'S GOING ON?

14:28.433 --> 14:29.933
-ALL RIGHT. WE...
-COME TALK TO ME.

14:30.067 --> 14:32.067
-WE HAD SOMETHING COME UP
MISSING FROM OUR ROOM,

14:32.100 --> 14:33.667
SO THEY-- WE HAD ALL LEFT.
-OKAY.

14:33.767 --> 14:35.433
-SO WE WENT
TO GO TALK TO THEM.

14:35.533 --> 14:37.233
TO ASK THEM, YOU KNOW,
YOU KNOW, WE WANT IT BACK.

14:37.333 --> 14:38.800
-OKAY. WHAT IS IT?
-THEY...

14:38.900 --> 14:41.067
IT WAS A PACK
OF CIGARILLOS

14:41.167 --> 14:42.533
BECAUSE WE SMOKE.
-OKAY.

14:42.633 --> 14:44.267
WE SMOKE CIGARILLOS.
-OKAY, SO THIS IS ALL
OVER CIGARILLOS?

14:44.367 --> 14:45.367
-YES. OVER CIGARILLOS.

14:45.467 --> 14:46.667
SO WE GO AND WE WALK
AND WE MEET THEM.

14:46.767 --> 14:48.400
AND WE'RE LIKE, YOU KNOW,
"WE WANT OUR STUFF BACK."

14:48.500 --> 14:50.567
YOU KNOW...
"YOU TOOK IT OUT OF OUR ROOM."

14:50.667 --> 14:51.733
YOU KNOW,
DA DA DA DA.

14:51.833 --> 14:53.567
WELL, SHE STARTS
FREAKING OUT, AS YOU HEARD.

14:53.667 --> 14:55.733
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HEARD--
-Woman: AND I SAID QUIT
CALLING ME A--

14:55.833 --> 14:57.733
-WHY DON'T YOU JUST
LISTEN TO WHAT HE SAYS?

14:57.833 --> 14:59.333
RELAX, OKAY?

14:59.433 --> 15:00.700
-SHE SITS THERE.
AS YOU CAN SEE,

15:00.800 --> 15:02.333
SHE'S BEING VERY BELLIGERENT.

15:02.433 --> 15:03.467
-MM-HMM.
-STARTS FREAKING OUT,

15:03.567 --> 15:04.700
CALLING ME
A SKANKY LITTLE WHORE,

15:04.800 --> 15:07.633
BECAUSE I GOT PREGNANT
BEFORE I TURNED 18,

15:07.733 --> 15:09.700
AND I'M NOT MARRIED,
AND DA DA DA DA DA,

15:09.800 --> 15:11.733
AND SHE SAYS,
"WELL, WHEN I GET
BACK TO THE HOUSE,

15:11.833 --> 15:13.900
"I'M TAKING ALL THAT (bleep)
OUT OF THE (bleep) ROOM."

15:14.067 --> 15:15.600
BECAUSE THE BED
THAT'S IN THERE,

15:15.700 --> 15:16.733
THE DRESSER
THAT'S IN THERE,

15:16.833 --> 15:18.700
THAT HAVE OUR CLOTHES
AND STUFF IN IT,

15:18.800 --> 15:20.133
IT CAME FROM HER HOUSE.

15:20.233 --> 15:21.467
-IS THAT YOUR ROOMMATE?

15:21.567 --> 15:23.567
-THAT'S MY BOYFRIEND
SO YES, MY ROOMMATE.
-OKAY.

15:23.667 --> 15:25.833
WELL, SHE'S LIKE,
"AS SOON AS I GET THERE,

15:25.933 --> 15:27.667
I'M GOING IN THERE
AND I'M TAKING
ALL THE (bleep) DOWN."

15:27.767 --> 15:29.200
MY BOYFRIEND IS WALKING
IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY,

15:29.300 --> 15:30.667
HE'S LIKE,
"YOU'RE NOT GOING IN THERE."

15:30.767 --> 15:32.067
HE'S LIKE, "YOU'RE NOT
GOING IN THERE.

15:32.133 --> 15:34.100
YOU'RE NOT GOING IN THERE."
SO WHEN WE GOT HERE,

15:34.200 --> 15:35.833
HE JUST STOOD.
JUST LIKE THIS.

15:35.933 --> 15:39.067
IN FRONT OF THE DOOR
AND SHE JUST
STRAIGHT PUSHED HIM.

15:39.100 --> 15:40.333
I'M LIKE, "I'M CALLING
THE COPS."
-OKAY.

15:40.433 --> 15:41.733
-"YOU'RE NOT GONNA
TOUCH MY BOYFRIEND."

15:41.833 --> 15:43.067
I MEAN I--
I CAN'T INTERVENE.

15:43.167 --> 15:45.633
AND I CAN'T STOP
THEM FROM ANYTHING.
-ALL RIGHT.

15:45.733 --> 15:47.167
LET ME GET
YOUR NAME, HON.
-ANDREA.

15:47.267 --> 15:48.733
-SEE MY VEHICLE RIGHT THERE?
-YES.

15:48.833 --> 15:50.733
-WHY DON'T YOU GO HANG
OUT BEHIND MY VEHICLE?

15:50.833 --> 15:52.067
OKAY?

15:52.100 --> 15:53.700
SO, TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED.

15:53.800 --> 15:55.067
-SHE CALLED ME A THIEF,

15:55.167 --> 15:56.867
I SAID,
"FINE! I'M A THIEF.

15:56.967 --> 15:58.433
I'M GONNA GO
BACK OVER HERE,"

15:58.533 --> 16:00.500
THEY'RE RENTING A ROOM.
I SAID, "THAT'S FINE."

16:00.600 --> 16:02.100
I'M GONNA TAKE
ALL MY FURNITURE OUT

16:02.200 --> 16:03.367
OF THE ROOM THAT
THEY'RE RENTING

16:03.467 --> 16:05.300
AND YOU GUYS CAN
GO GET YOUR OWN STUFF.
-MM-HMM.

16:05.400 --> 16:06.533
-BUT SINCE...

16:06.633 --> 16:08.567
AND I HAVE TO GO
THROUGH THERE
TO GO OUT BACK.

16:08.667 --> 16:10.400
-I COULD GO THROUGH
THERE OUT BACK...
-WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

16:10.500 --> 16:11.800
OKAY, WHY DON'T YOU
LOWER YOUR VOICE DOWN?

16:11.900 --> 16:13.567
I'M RIGHT HERE
IN FRONT OF YOU...
-I'M SORRY.

16:13.667 --> 16:15.067
I'M JUST AGGRAVATED.
-I UNDERSTAND YOU ARE,

16:15.167 --> 16:16.800
BUT I'M RIGHT HERE,
AND I EXPECT THAT

16:16.900 --> 16:18.233
YOU WOULD GO AHEAD
AND TALK TO ME THE SAME

16:18.333 --> 16:19.533
LEVEL I TALK TO YOU AT.
-I'M SORRY.

16:19.633 --> 16:21.567
-OKAY. WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
-PATRICIA.

16:21.667 --> 16:23.300
HE PRETTY MUCH PUSHED ME
AND SAID, "NO YOU'RE NOT."

16:23.400 --> 16:24.700
OKAY.
-OKAY.

16:24.800 --> 16:26.333
-AND THAT'S WHEN
SHE STARTED FREAKIN'.

16:26.433 --> 16:27.767
AND I'M LIKE, "ALL RIGHT."
AND THEN I SAID,

16:27.867 --> 16:28.933
"DREW, YOU BETTER
LET GO OF ME."

16:29.067 --> 16:30.500
HE PRETTY MUCH
GRABBED ME AND HELD ME.

16:30.600 --> 16:32.667
-HOW MANY-- HOW MANY MONTHS
HAVE THEY BEEN LIVING HERE NOW?

16:32.767 --> 16:34.700
-NO MONTHS.
-HOW MANY WEEKS
HAVE THEY BEEN LIVING HERE?

16:34.800 --> 16:36.933
-WELL, THEY... LAST SUNDAY.
AND THEY HAVE NOT YET

16:37.067 --> 16:39.267
PAID ME ONE THING,
AND THEY HAVE NOTHING
IN THEIR NAME.

16:39.367 --> 16:41.533
AND I TOLD DREW EARLIER
THAT I WANT HIM

16:41.633 --> 16:43.767
AND HIS SKANKY LITTLE
GIRLFRIEND OUT OF MY HOUSE.

16:43.867 --> 16:45.900
-BUT HERE'S THE THING,
IF THEY'RE LIVING IN THERE,

16:46.067 --> 16:48.600
FOR THREE DAYS OR MORE
ACCORDING TO FLORIDA
STATE STATUTES,

16:48.700 --> 16:51.133
THEY ARE ENTITLED
TO LIVE THERE

16:51.233 --> 16:53.933
AS A-- THEIR PLACE
THAT THEY LIVE AT.

16:54.067 --> 16:55.533
THIS IS THEIR PRIMARY HOME NOW.
THEY LIVE THERE.

16:55.633 --> 16:57.233
THEY GOT THEIR STUFF
IN THERE NOW.
-NO, THEY DON'T.

16:57.333 --> 16:58.500
THEY HAVE MY STUFF IN THERE.

16:58.600 --> 17:00.367
-NEVERTHELESS, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE AGREEMENT IS

17:00.467 --> 17:02.933
BETWEEN YOU AND THEM,
BUT MY SUGGESTION TO YOU

17:03.067 --> 17:06.233
IS WHAT YOU NEED TO DO
IS EVICT THEM FROM THE PROPERTY.

17:06.333 --> 17:08.833
OKAY? YOU GOTTA GO DOWN
TO THE COUNTY COURTHOUSE

17:08.933 --> 17:10.167
AND FILE AN EVICTION NOTICE.

17:10.267 --> 17:12.300
BUT YOU GUYS
NEED TO CALM DOWN, OKAY?

17:12.400 --> 17:14.200
ALL RIGHT.
BE RIGHT BACK.

17:15.633 --> 17:17.567
-MY AUNT PUSHED ME.
I NEVER PUSHED HER AT ALL.

17:17.667 --> 17:20.333
LIKE... I WON'T EVEN
LEAVE MY ROOM,

17:20.433 --> 17:23.100
IF SHE'D JUST RESPECT MY ROOM
AND NOT COME IN THERE.

17:23.200 --> 17:24.467
-I UNDERSTAND.
-YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

17:24.567 --> 17:26.133
I MEAN, I GOTTA HAVE
MY OWN PERSONAL SPACE.

17:26.233 --> 17:27.867
I GOT A PREGNANT
GIRLFRIEND, YOU KNOW?

17:27.967 --> 17:30.733
I CAN'T EVEN... WE CAN'T EVEN
LAY IN THE BED NAKED AT NIGHT,

17:30.833 --> 17:32.467
AND THEY JUST COME
IN WHENEVER THEY WANT TO.

17:32.567 --> 17:34.433
-HOW MANY WEEKS
PREGNANT IS SHE?

17:34.533 --> 17:36.533
-SHE'S EIGHT MONTHS PREGNANT.
-EIGHT MONTHS NOW?

17:36.633 --> 17:38.067
-THE FURNITURE WAS HERE
WHEN I GOT HERE.

17:38.133 --> 17:39.933
SHE'S THE ONE WHO ASKED
ME TO MOVE HERE,

17:40.067 --> 17:42.067
SO I CAN PAY THE BILLS.
-OKAY.

17:42.167 --> 17:43.567
-I MEAN, THE WATER
AND THE ELECTRICITY

17:43.667 --> 17:45.267
ARE GONNA GET
SHUT OFF THIS WEEK,

17:45.367 --> 17:47.633
BUT I'M PAYING IT
SO IT'S NOT GETTING SHUT OFF.

17:47.733 --> 17:49.067
-OKAY.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

17:50.067 --> 17:52.200
YOU AND HIM
PUSHING EACH OTHER.

17:52.300 --> 17:53.967
THAT'S ALL I'M CONCERNED
ABOUT RIGHT NOW.

17:54.067 --> 17:56.633
OKAY?
-OH. I NEVER TOUCHED HIM.

17:56.733 --> 17:59.400
HE PRETTY MUCH GRABBED
ME TO STOP ME GOING

17:59.500 --> 18:02.133
AND GRABBING MY STUFF.
-WELL, REMEMBER THAT'S...

18:02.233 --> 18:03.833
-REMEMBER, SHE'S ACTUALLY--
WHATEVER SHE IS SAYING,

18:03.933 --> 18:06.067
SHE WAS ACTUALLY OUTSIDE.
-BUT YOU'RE NOT
UNDERSTANDING ME.

18:06.100 --> 18:07.933
THEY'RE RENTING.
THEY'RE TECHNICALLY RENTING.

18:08.067 --> 18:09.633
THEY'RE TECHNICALLY
RENTING A ROOM.

18:09.733 --> 18:11.533
SO WE'RE ONLY HERE--
YOU CAN'T STOP THEM NOW

18:11.633 --> 18:13.467
FROM GOING IN THEIR ROOM.
HERE'S THE THING.
-I'M NOT!

18:13.567 --> 18:15.500
-HERE'S THE THING.
AND I ALWAYS TELL PEOPLE THIS...

18:15.600 --> 18:18.567
-I'M NOT STOPPING THEM
FROM GOING INTO THE ROOM.
-LET ME TALK.

18:18.667 --> 18:20.133
-OKAY.
-IT'S A FUNNY LINE.

18:20.233 --> 18:21.733
IT'S EASY
TO MOVE PEOPLE IN,

18:21.833 --> 18:23.067
IT'S HARD
TO MOVE 'EM OUT.

18:23.100 --> 18:25.233
AND I TELL THAT TO
A LOT OF PEOPLE DURING THE DAY.

18:25.333 --> 18:26.333
OKAY?
-ALL RIGHT.

18:26.433 --> 18:28.067
-SO TECHNICALLY,
THAT'S HIS ROOM.

18:28.133 --> 18:29.567
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT I'M GETTING AT?

18:29.667 --> 18:31.067
SO WHAT
YOU NEED TO DO

18:31.133 --> 18:34.367
IS... YOU CAN'T STOP THEM
FROM GOING IN THE ROOM.

18:34.467 --> 18:36.633
AND THE THINGS
THAT ARE IN THAT ROOM

18:36.733 --> 18:39.500
ONCE YOU RENTED THEM OUT,
THOSE THINGS STAY
IN THE ROOM.

18:39.600 --> 18:40.767
I HATE TO TELL YOU THAT.

18:40.867 --> 18:44.267
BUT YOU GUYS PUT YOURSELF
IN THAT SITUATION.
-OKAY.

18:44.367 --> 18:46.333
-OKAY BUT WHAT YOU NEED
TO DO IS-- THIS IS WHAT
YOU NEED TO DO.

18:46.433 --> 18:48.233
WHATEVER DAY YOU WANT
TO GO DOWN TO
THE COUNTY COURTHOUSE,

18:48.333 --> 18:50.133
YOU NEED TO FILL OUT
THE EVICTION PROCESS.

18:50.233 --> 18:51.300
-THAT'S FINE.
-OKAY.

18:51.400 --> 18:52.800
-THEY CAN STAY THERE.
-ALL RIGHT,

18:52.900 --> 18:54.600
BUT HERE'S THE THING.
I'M GONNA COME BACK LATER,

18:54.700 --> 18:56.067
AND I JUST DON'T WANT
THIS TO ESCALATE.

18:56.133 --> 18:57.733
-IT WON'T ESCALATE.
-OKAY.

18:57.833 --> 19:00.533
-BUT SHE TOOK THE DOORS DOWN,
SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE
A SERIOUS PROBLEM.

19:00.633 --> 19:02.200
-THEY PUT DOORS UP,
SHE RIPPED 'EM DOWN.

19:02.300 --> 19:04.200
THEY SAID, "WELL,
YOU GUYS AIN'T GONNA
HAVE NO PRIVACY."

19:04.300 --> 19:05.967
WELL, IT WAS ME
AND MY PREGNANT GIRLFRIEND.

19:06.067 --> 19:07.733
-AND, SIR...
-WHAT'S THE RULES ON THAT?

19:07.833 --> 19:09.100
-...WE DON'T HAVE
ANY AIR CONDITIONING.

19:09.200 --> 19:10.800
-THERE'S TWO
MINORS IN THE HOUSE.
-I UNDERSTAND THAT.

19:10.900 --> 19:12.433
-I SLEEP NAKED.
-THERE'S TWO MINORS
IN THE HOUSE.

19:12.533 --> 19:15.900
-I'M NOT GONNA
NOT SLEEP NAKED JUST BECAUSE
OF SOMETHING SHE DID.

19:16.067 --> 19:18.067
AND I DON'T WANT THE COPS--
I DON'T WANT YOU GUYS
COMING BACK,

19:18.167 --> 19:20.467
SAYING I'M INDECENTLY
EXPOSING MYSELF TO TWO MINORS.

19:20.567 --> 19:22.500
-ISN'T THERE
A DOMESTIC KIND OF--
ISN'T THERE SOMETHING THAT--

19:22.600 --> 19:25.067
-NO, THERE'S NOT.
-TWO KIDS CAN'T EVEN SLEEP
IN THE SAME ROOM.

19:25.167 --> 19:26.900
-IT'S STILL TECHNICALLY
YOUR AUNT, RIGHT?

19:27.067 --> 19:29.067
SHE ALSO GAVE YOU
A PLACE TO LIVE TOO, RIGHT?

19:29.100 --> 19:31.633
-WELL, YEAH, SHE CALLED
AND SHE ASKED ME TO MOVE IN,
BUT SHE DIDN'T--

19:31.733 --> 19:34.633
-NEVERTHELESS-- OKAY.
-BUT SHE GETS LIKE THIS
ALL THE TIME.

19:34.733 --> 19:36.633
I KNOW SHE'LL BE
OVER IT TOMORROW,

19:36.733 --> 19:39.067
AND THEN SHE'LL GET MAD
ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE
IN THREE DAYS.

19:39.133 --> 19:40.567
SHE'S, LIKE,
BIPOLAR OR SOMETHING.

19:40.667 --> 19:43.967
-MY SUGGESTION TO YOU
IS DO WHAT YOU CAN DO
FOR YOUR PRIVACY,

19:44.067 --> 19:47.733
AND JUST FIND ANOTHER PLACE
THAT IS MORE CONDUCENT
TO WHAT YOU GUYS NEED.

19:48.733 --> 19:49.767
-Officer over radio:
132 AND BUSH.

19:49.867 --> 19:51.433
I'VE GOT HIM AT GUNPOINT.

19:51.533 --> 19:53.200
-Dispatcher:
OKAY, GUNPOINT, 132 AND BUSH.

19:53.300 --> 19:54.233
COVER IS CODE THREE.

19:54.333 --> 19:57.333
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)

20:03.167 --> 20:05.900
-Dispatcher:
OKAY, STILL SEND A CODE THREE.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.533
-(theme music playing)
