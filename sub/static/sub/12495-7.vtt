WEBVTT

00:16.433 --> 00:17.434
What are you doing?

00:17.601 --> 00:19.687
I'm waiting for a cute girl.

00:19.728 --> 00:21.856
Oh.

00:19.728 --> 00:21.856
That's pretty

00:19.728 --> 00:21.856
creepy.

00:24.650 --> 00:27.695
Ooh, ooh. Here she comes.

00:24.650 --> 00:27.695
Get away, get away, get away.

00:35.619 --> 00:38.539
Whoa. Hey, Monica.

00:38.998 --> 00:41.166
Oh, hi, Jasper.

00:38.998 --> 00:41.166
Uh...

00:42.376 --> 00:44.003
Cool skirt.

00:45.212 --> 00:46.213
Thanks.

00:46.588 --> 00:47.965
What are those, flowers?

00:50.300 --> 00:52.511
Uh... yeah.

00:50.300 --> 00:52.511
Mmm-hmm.

00:54.262 --> 00:57.057
Hey, you didn't tell anybody

00:54.262 --> 00:57.057
my secret, did you?

00:57.098 --> 00:58.600
Of course not.

00:59.560 --> 01:00.728
Look, look, look.

01:00.769 --> 01:01.770
Look.

01:03.647 --> 01:04.773
He's doing it again.

01:05.273 --> 01:07.442
What, Jasper?

01:05.273 --> 01:07.442
Yeah. He keeps trying

01:07.484 --> 01:09.820
to make that girl

01:07.484 --> 01:09.820
Monica think he's Kid Danger.

01:09.862 --> 01:11.112
(laughs)

01:11.154 --> 01:12.113
Oh, man.

01:12.740 --> 01:14.449
Ow.

01:12.740 --> 01:14.449
Are you okay?

01:14.491 --> 01:15.701
Yeah.

01:15.743 --> 01:18.203
I just had a rough night

01:15.743 --> 01:18.203
last night at work.

01:18.537 --> 01:21.081
Really? Was there

01:18.537 --> 01:21.081
a lot of... Danger?

01:21.122 --> 01:22.708
Shh.

01:24.960 --> 01:26.712
You know I can't talk

01:24.960 --> 01:26.712
about my job.

01:27.880 --> 01:29.464
Ooh, sorry.

01:29.506 --> 01:31.675
(laughs)

01:29.506 --> 01:31.675
He touched her lips.

01:32.718 --> 01:34.970
It's not funny.

01:32.718 --> 01:34.970
He's lying to her.

01:35.846 --> 01:37.472
And now she's got

01:35.846 --> 01:37.472
dirty lips.

01:39.516 --> 01:40.517
Come on.

01:41.142 --> 01:43.979
Hey, Jasper.

01:41.142 --> 01:43.979
What's poopinin'?

01:44.939 --> 01:46.941
Henry...

01:44.939 --> 01:46.941
You guys know Monica.

01:46.982 --> 01:47.942
Sure.

01:46.982 --> 01:47.942
Hey, Monica.

01:47.983 --> 01:49.109
Hi.

01:49.150 --> 01:50.652
So, dude, trick

01:49.150 --> 01:50.652
or treating tonight,

01:50.694 --> 01:51.862
you still coming with us?

01:51.904 --> 01:54.155
It's okay to say no.

01:54.197 --> 01:55.115
Yeah, I'm coming.

01:56.324 --> 01:57.659
You want to come trick

01:56.324 --> 01:57.659
or treating with us?

01:57.701 --> 02:01.121
I'd love to come.

01:57.701 --> 02:01.121
Cool. Just remember...

02:01.162 --> 02:03.958
A certain Captain

02:01.162 --> 02:03.958
might need my help tonight.

02:05.125 --> 02:09.964
That's okay.

02:05.125 --> 02:09.964
I like danger.

02:05.125 --> 02:09.964
And danger likes you.

02:13.008 --> 02:14.593
Hey, Jasper.

02:13.008 --> 02:14.593
What?

02:16.011 --> 02:17.596
Shh.

02:30.776 --> 02:33.112
Hey, hey, hey.

02:30.776 --> 02:33.112
Check me out.

02:34.613 --> 02:36.615
(Harvey groans)

02:38.533 --> 02:40.702
What are you?

02:38.533 --> 02:40.702
I'm a zombie

02:38.533 --> 02:40.702
tennis player.

02:42.245 --> 02:44.081
Cool costume, right?

02:44.123 --> 02:46.458
Don't you think zombies

02:44.123 --> 02:46.458
are kind of played out?

02:46.500 --> 02:48.877
Well, yeah,

02:46.500 --> 02:48.877
regular zombies.

02:48.919 --> 02:50.963
That's why I added

02:48.919 --> 02:50.963
the whole tennis element.

02:51.005 --> 02:56.384
So, now it's...

02:51.005 --> 02:56.384
Boom... Fresh.

02:56.426 --> 02:57.678
(doorbell rings)

02:57.719 --> 02:59.138
Hey, I think we have

02:57.719 --> 02:59.138
another trick or treater!

02:59.638 --> 03:01.015
Yes,

02:59.638 --> 03:01.015
I heard the doorbell!

03:04.143 --> 03:06.020
Trick or treat.

03:07.312 --> 03:09.023
You stole my costume.

03:09.064 --> 03:11.483
Just put the candy

03:09.064 --> 03:11.483
in the sack.

03:18.073 --> 03:19.908
Boom, fresh.

03:20.659 --> 03:21.743
Yeah, all right.

03:23.328 --> 03:26.289
Henry, will you help me

03:23.328 --> 03:26.289
find my car keys?

03:26.331 --> 03:27.582
No thanks.

03:28.083 --> 03:31.045
Hey, interesting costumes.

03:32.087 --> 03:33.296
Thanks.

03:32.087 --> 03:33.296
I'm a garbage man.

03:33.881 --> 03:35.716
And I'm a bag of trash.

03:37.551 --> 03:39.469
And I'm so proud

03:37.551 --> 03:39.469
to be your son.

03:41.304 --> 03:43.223
I am so angry.

03:43.932 --> 03:46.685
Whoa. Who are you

03:43.932 --> 03:46.685
supposed to be?

03:46.727 --> 03:49.479
I was supposed

03:46.727 --> 03:49.479
to be Taylor Swift.

03:50.355 --> 03:52.482
Well, you don't look

03:50.355 --> 03:52.482
very much like Taylor Swift.

03:52.983 --> 03:56.195
Yeah, 'cause your husband

03:52.983 --> 03:56.195
ordered me the wrong costume.

03:56.236 --> 03:57.821
My name is Dad.

03:58.613 --> 04:00.281
I'm not talking

03:58.613 --> 04:00.281
to you tonight.

04:01.783 --> 04:03.326
That's not the costume

04:01.783 --> 04:03.326
you wanted?

04:03.368 --> 04:06.914
No. I told Dad to order me

04:03.368 --> 04:06.914
a Taylor Swift costume.

04:06.955 --> 04:08.832
I made a mistake.

04:06.955 --> 04:08.832
And he ordered me

04:08.874 --> 04:10.834
this Jonathan Swift

04:08.874 --> 04:10.834
costume.

04:12.086 --> 04:14.838
Who's Jonathan Swift?

04:12.086 --> 04:14.838
Exactly.

04:16.173 --> 04:18.800
He's a very famous 18th century

04:16.173 --> 04:18.800
author from Ireland.

04:20.886 --> 04:22.763
What? I'm weird

04:20.886 --> 04:22.763
'cause I'm educated?

04:25.265 --> 04:27.226
Ooh, we're late

04:25.265 --> 04:27.226
for the party. We've got to go.

04:27.267 --> 04:28.977
I just need my purse.

04:27.267 --> 04:28.977
What?

04:29.019 --> 04:30.520
You're going to a party?

04:30.562 --> 04:31.897
I thought you were going to

04:30.562 --> 04:31.897
take Piper trick or treating.

04:31.939 --> 04:33.314
We were.

04:31.939 --> 04:33.314
Now you are.

04:33.356 --> 04:34.524
What? Wait!

04:34.566 --> 04:35.901
Sorry, got to

04:34.566 --> 04:35.901
take out the trash.

04:35.943 --> 04:37.569
That's me.

04:35.943 --> 04:37.569
No!

04:37.611 --> 04:40.822
Mom, dad, please don't make me

04:37.611 --> 04:40.822
take Piper trick or treating!

04:40.864 --> 04:43.909
We had a deal!

04:40.864 --> 04:43.909
You can't just...

04:43.951 --> 04:44.701
I love you?

04:45.535 --> 04:47.121
(car horn honks)

04:52.126 --> 04:54.086
You think

04:52.126 --> 04:54.086
I'm happy about it?

04:55.129 --> 04:56.130
You just listen to me.

04:57.547 --> 05:01.176
I'm in charge tonight

04:57.547 --> 05:01.176
so you have to show me respect.

05:06.014 --> 05:07.849
Starting now.

05:09.559 --> 05:11.103
Hey, halloweeners.

05:12.729 --> 05:14.064
Have no fear...

05:14.106 --> 05:15.941
Kid danger is here.

05:16.900 --> 05:19.153
Oh...

05:16.900 --> 05:19.153
My...

05:19.194 --> 05:20.320
God.

05:22.156 --> 05:23.282
It all just kind of happened.

05:23.323 --> 05:25.284
My dad was

05:23.323 --> 05:25.284
an irresponsible scientist.

05:25.909 --> 05:27.286
I wanted an afterschool job.

05:27.327 --> 05:30.330
And by accident,

05:27.327 --> 05:30.330
he made me indestructible.

05:30.371 --> 05:31.623
(screams)

05:31.665 --> 05:33.250
(Harvey)

05:31.665 --> 05:33.250
I went into this crazy store

05:33.959 --> 05:35.919
and met

05:33.959 --> 05:35.919
a pretty interesting guy.

05:35.961 --> 05:37.462
I'm gonna blow your mind.

05:37.504 --> 05:39.506
(Ray)

05:37.504 --> 05:39.506
Now I protect the good citizens

05:37.504 --> 05:39.506
of Swellview.

05:39.547 --> 05:40.799
Who call me...

05:40.841 --> 05:42.550
And he turned out to be...

05:40.841 --> 05:42.550
You know the name.

05:42.592 --> 05:44.886
Captain Man.

05:42.592 --> 05:44.886
That's right, Henry.

05:44.928 --> 05:47.597
In time, I realized

05:44.928 --> 05:47.597
that being a superhero

05:47.639 --> 05:49.224
is a lot to handle alone.

05:49.266 --> 05:51.726
He wanted some help.

05:49.266 --> 05:51.726
(Ray)

05:49.266 --> 05:51.726
I needed a sidekick.

05:51.768 --> 05:53.187
I, Henry Hart...

05:53.228 --> 05:54.980
(Ray)

05:53.228 --> 05:54.980
Pledge to never ever, ever

05:53.228 --> 05:54.980
tell anyone...

05:55.022 --> 05:56.982
That I'm Captain Man's

05:55.022 --> 05:56.982
secret sidekick.

05:57.024 --> 05:58.357
It is done.

05:58.399 --> 06:00.359
(Henry)

05:58.399 --> 06:00.359
Now we blow bubbles.

05:58.399 --> 06:00.359
(Ray)

05:58.399 --> 06:00.359
And fight crime.

06:00.401 --> 06:01.820
(Henry)

06:00.401 --> 06:01.820
Feels good.

06:15.834 --> 06:16.501
Call it.

06:16.543 --> 06:18.086
Up the tube!

06:19.046 --> 06:20.463
Oh, my boots.

06:20.505 --> 06:21.422
(Ray screams)

06:27.554 --> 06:32.351
Stupid Jonathan Swift.

06:27.554 --> 06:32.351
Way to go, Dad.

06:34.353 --> 06:36.355
So, Jasper...

06:34.353 --> 06:36.355
Uh, uh, uh.

06:36.395 --> 06:39.398
Tonight you can call me

06:36.395 --> 06:39.398
Kid Danger.

06:39.941 --> 06:44.071
Okay, cool.

06:39.941 --> 06:44.071
So, can I ask you something?

06:44.112 --> 06:45.322
Sure.

06:45.364 --> 06:46.990
How come your costume

06:47.032 --> 06:49.201
doesn't look quite like

06:47.032 --> 06:49.201
the real Kid Danger costume?

06:49.993 --> 06:54.956
Oh. See...

06:49.993 --> 06:54.956
By wearing this fake costume,

06:55.540 --> 06:58.501
no bad guys will ever suspect

06:55.540 --> 06:58.501
that I'm the real Kid Danger.

06:59.336 --> 07:01.213
Oh.

06:59.336 --> 07:01.213
That makes sense, right?

07:02.672 --> 07:04.007
Yeah, that tracks.

07:06.051 --> 07:07.177
You guys, come on.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.221
We going trick

07:07.761 --> 07:09.221
or treating or what?

07:09.263 --> 07:11.932
Yeah, let's do it.

07:09.263 --> 07:11.932
Okay.

07:12.432 --> 07:15.685
Let's start on Riverside because

07:12.432 --> 07:15.685
rich people give out great candy

07:16.353 --> 07:17.854
and then we can go--

07:16.353 --> 07:17.854
(watch beeping)

07:20.565 --> 07:22.567
Why is your watch

07:20.565 --> 07:22.567
always beeping?

07:23.777 --> 07:25.987
It's my boss

07:23.777 --> 07:25.987
from Junk-N-Stuff.

07:26.029 --> 07:27.364
I got to go see what he wants.

07:27.406 --> 07:28.656
I'll go with you.

07:27.406 --> 07:28.656
Right.

07:28.698 --> 07:31.159
No. We're supposed

07:28.698 --> 07:31.159
to go trick or treating.

07:31.785 --> 07:33.078
Hey, I'm going to take Monica

07:33.120 --> 07:35.122
and go hit the houses

07:33.120 --> 07:35.122
on Riverside.

07:36.790 --> 07:37.749
Cool.

07:37.791 --> 07:38.666
We'll text you

07:37.791 --> 07:38.666
and meet up later.

07:38.708 --> 07:40.252
Okay.

07:38.708 --> 07:40.252
See you.

07:40.794 --> 07:42.921
We better hurry.

07:40.794 --> 07:42.921
Yeah. Piper, let's go.

07:42.963 --> 07:45.757
No. I'm not going

07:42.963 --> 07:45.757
to your stupid store.

07:46.300 --> 07:48.343
I promised Mom and Dad

07:46.300 --> 07:48.343
I'd watch you tonight.

07:48.385 --> 07:50.637
So, watch me stuff candy

07:48.385 --> 07:50.637
in my face.

07:51.972 --> 07:54.015
We'll take you trick

07:51.972 --> 07:54.015
or treating right after.

07:54.057 --> 07:55.642
Not acceptable.

07:55.683 --> 07:58.228
If you guys don't take me trick

07:55.683 --> 07:58.228
or treating right now,

07:58.270 --> 07:59.980
then I'll tell Mom and Dad--

08:01.773 --> 08:04.818
Why'd you do that?

08:01.773 --> 08:04.818
She was talking so much.

08:06.194 --> 08:09.364
Now, come on, we got to go see

08:06.194 --> 08:09.364
what Ray wants. Grab her feet.

08:09.406 --> 08:10.657
Aw, man.

08:14.869 --> 08:16.288
(grunting)

08:19.916 --> 08:20.750
Happy Halloween.

08:20.792 --> 08:21.835
Shabbat Shalom.

08:25.046 --> 08:27.090
So...

08:25.046 --> 08:27.090
When you're Kid Danger

08:27.132 --> 08:29.968
and you and Captain Man

08:27.132 --> 08:29.968
are fighting bad guys,

08:30.010 --> 08:31.803
do you ever worry

08:30.010 --> 08:31.803
about getting hurt?

08:31.845 --> 08:33.763
Nah.

08:33.805 --> 08:36.850
When someone needs a superhero,

08:33.805 --> 08:36.850
I don't think, I just do.

08:38.393 --> 08:42.981
That's so Yoda.

08:38.393 --> 08:42.981
You really get me.

08:44.565 --> 08:45.775
(glass shattering)

08:47.235 --> 08:50.530
Oh my gosh. You see that guy?

08:47.235 --> 08:50.530
He's breaking into that car.

08:51.072 --> 08:52.782
Maybe we should

08:51.072 --> 08:52.782
call the cops.

08:52.824 --> 08:54.493
You don't need the cops.

08:54.534 --> 08:58.163
Why don't I?

08:54.534 --> 08:58.163
Because you're Kid Danger.

08:59.498 --> 09:06.004
Right. But Captain Man's

08:59.498 --> 09:06.004
not here with me, so...

09:06.046 --> 09:09.466
It's just one guy.

09:06.046 --> 09:09.466
Go get him, Kid Danger.

09:11.259 --> 09:12.760
Yeah, I don't know...

09:15.722 --> 09:16.723
You there!

09:17.224 --> 09:18.475
Stop what you're doing!

09:19.642 --> 09:21.728
Hey, you, in the car there!

09:23.397 --> 09:25.232
Whoa. Cool 'stume.

09:26.400 --> 09:29.403
This is not just a 'stume.

09:26.400 --> 09:29.403
I'm...

09:31.738 --> 09:33.740
I'm the real Kid Danger.

09:35.616 --> 09:40.121
Cool. Hand me a screwdriver.

09:35.616 --> 09:40.121
For what?

09:40.163 --> 09:42.332
I'm trying to steal part

09:40.163 --> 09:42.332
of this car.

09:42.374 --> 09:44.876
Could you check there,

09:42.374 --> 09:44.876
in my bag of burglar tools?

09:46.545 --> 09:48.963
No, I'm not going to check

09:46.545 --> 09:48.963
your bag of tools.

09:50.048 --> 09:52.384
You're...

09:50.048 --> 09:52.384
You're under arrest, man.

09:54.219 --> 09:55.720
(laughs)

09:55.762 --> 09:59.015
>> You're hilarious.

09:55.762 --> 09:59.015
Hang on a sec, I'll come out.

10:07.107 --> 10:10.693
Hey... Aren't you Captain Man's

10:07.107 --> 10:10.693
new little partner?

10:11.278 --> 10:14.739
That's Kid Danger and

10:11.278 --> 10:14.739
he's going to rip your face off.

10:16.699 --> 10:21.162
I will handle this.

10:16.699 --> 10:21.162
Will you please just go home?

10:22.456 --> 10:25.083
I bet Captain Man

10:22.456 --> 10:25.083
would pay big bucks

10:25.125 --> 10:27.085
to get his

10:25.125 --> 10:27.085
little Kid Danger back.

10:28.628 --> 10:32.048
Actually, we're like a

10:28.628 --> 10:32.048
non-profit crime-fighting team,

10:32.090 --> 10:34.509
so I doubt that he would--

10:36.303 --> 10:38.430
Ooh, now you're really

10:36.303 --> 10:38.430
gonna get it.

10:38.472 --> 10:40.056
Please stop helping me.

10:42.517 --> 10:44.060
(thief)

10:42.517 --> 10:44.060
Can you stop resisting?

10:46.563 --> 10:48.022
Come here.

10:55.405 --> 10:57.532
Omar. Omar, look.

10:55.405 --> 10:57.532
A jelly bean.

10:58.199 --> 11:00.368
Would you like a jelly bean?

11:01.744 --> 11:02.496
Here you go.

11:05.582 --> 11:08.709
Oh, yes. You chew so cutely.

11:15.383 --> 11:17.927
Henry and Charlotte.

11:15.383 --> 11:17.927
Happy Halloween.

11:17.969 --> 11:19.387
Hey.

11:17.969 --> 11:19.387
What's up?

11:19.429 --> 11:21.931
Who is that?

11:19.429 --> 11:21.931
Oh, this is my little sister.

11:22.599 --> 11:25.726
And when did you kill her?

11:22.599 --> 11:25.726
She's not dead.

11:25.768 --> 11:27.354
I just stunned her.

11:25.768 --> 11:27.354
Oh, good.

11:29.272 --> 11:31.191
Will you keep an eye on her

11:29.272 --> 11:31.191
while we go talk to Ray?

11:31.232 --> 11:32.359
Sure.

11:31.232 --> 11:32.359
Cool.

11:32.400 --> 11:33.610
Thanks.

11:36.112 --> 11:37.905
(gagging)

11:39.407 --> 11:41.868
Something wrong with Omar?

11:39.407 --> 11:41.868
Well...

11:41.909 --> 11:43.786
I just gave him a jelly bean.

11:41.909 --> 11:43.786
And--

11:47.748 --> 11:49.584
Your plant just puked

11:47.748 --> 11:49.584
on my sister.

11:50.502 --> 11:53.712
Yes. No more candy for you.

12:04.391 --> 12:05.808
You all right?

12:05.850 --> 12:07.686
Yeah, but I think

12:05.850 --> 12:07.686
I dropped a noodle.

12:09.479 --> 12:11.481
Ray?

12:09.479 --> 12:11.481
Happy Halloween.

12:14.359 --> 12:16.194
Look. I'm a cheer lobster.

12:20.657 --> 12:23.201
Cheer lobster?

12:20.657 --> 12:23.201
Is that, like, a thing?

12:23.868 --> 12:25.245
Yeah, it's a thing.

12:26.120 --> 12:29.999
Look.

12:26.120 --> 12:29.999
Go team! Please don't boil me

12:31.750 --> 12:36.130
or use a tiny fork

12:31.750 --> 12:36.130
to remove my flesh and eat me!

12:36.172 --> 12:38.174
You look more like a lobster

12:36.172 --> 12:38.174
than a cheerleader.

12:38.216 --> 12:40.301
Well, there was no room

12:38.216 --> 12:40.301
for lobster boobs.

12:41.595 --> 12:43.137
Why did you beep Henry?

12:43.179 --> 12:45.348
So you guys could come see

12:43.179 --> 12:45.348
my cool costume.

12:45.390 --> 12:49.060
Aw, Ray. I had to zap

12:45.390 --> 12:49.060
my little sister to come here.

12:49.102 --> 12:51.896
You killed her?

12:49.102 --> 12:51.896
No. I just stunned her.

12:52.813 --> 12:54.815
Wait, I think

12:52.813 --> 12:54.815
it was set to stun.

12:54.857 --> 12:56.943
Stun is blue

12:54.857 --> 12:56.943
and kill is red, right?

12:56.984 --> 12:59.571
I don't know.

12:56.984 --> 12:59.571
I can never remember.

12:59.613 --> 13:01.155
Can we please go trick

12:59.613 --> 13:01.155
or treating?

13:01.197 --> 13:02.365
(alarm ringing)

13:02.407 --> 13:04.325
Uh-oh, trouble.

13:08.329 --> 13:11.874
Oh, shellfish!

13:08.329 --> 13:11.874
What's up, gooch?

13:12.417 --> 13:14.669
You just received a video.

13:12.417 --> 13:14.669
From who?

13:14.711 --> 13:17.422
From a man who claims

13:14.711 --> 13:17.422
to have captured Kid Danger.

13:19.424 --> 13:21.509
Play the video.

13:22.051 --> 13:23.553
Hey, Captain Man.

13:23.595 --> 13:24.763
It's your old friend--

13:23.595 --> 13:24.763
Pause!

13:26.598 --> 13:31.269
Jeff.

13:26.598 --> 13:31.269
That guy is so stupid.

13:32.520 --> 13:33.896
How do you know him?

13:33.938 --> 13:36.190
He's been a petty thief

13:33.938 --> 13:36.190
in Swellview for years.

13:36.232 --> 13:38.985
I put him in jail, like,

13:36.232 --> 13:38.985
a dozen times. Resume play.

13:39.860 --> 13:42.821
So, guess what?

13:39.860 --> 13:42.821
I kidnapped your sidekick.

13:43.490 --> 13:45.992
Aw, please don't be Jasper.

13:43.490 --> 13:45.992
Please don't be Jasper.

13:46.033 --> 13:47.452
It's gonna be Jasper.

13:48.286 --> 13:48.911
Take a look.

13:49.454 --> 13:52.707
(mumbling)

13:52.749 --> 13:56.127
It's Jasper.

13:52.749 --> 13:56.127
What a surprise twist.

13:58.630 --> 14:01.341
Hey, isn't that kid your

13:58.630 --> 14:01.341
friend with the sweaty hands

14:01.382 --> 14:03.426
who loves buckets?

14:03.468 --> 14:05.219
That's him.

14:05.261 --> 14:08.014
How can that Jeff guy think

14:05.261 --> 14:08.014
Jasper's the real Kid Danger?

14:08.055 --> 14:10.183
Oh, well, see...

14:08.055 --> 14:10.183
It's because he's a moron.

14:12.018 --> 14:14.688
Oh, and I also

14:12.018 --> 14:14.688
kidnapped Kid Danger's woman.

14:14.729 --> 14:18.274
(mumbling)

14:18.899 --> 14:21.194
Now, if you ever want

14:18.899 --> 14:21.194
to see them again,

14:21.235 --> 14:25.490
you better bring me, like...

14:21.235 --> 14:25.490
A million dollars.

14:26.616 --> 14:30.161
Oh, and I want two big-n-beefys

14:26.616 --> 14:30.161
from Inside Out Burger.

14:30.203 --> 14:33.039
With fries. And don't forget

14:30.203 --> 14:33.039
the million dollars.

14:34.791 --> 14:37.251
What? Is that guy insane?

14:34.791 --> 14:37.251
Yeah.

14:37.293 --> 14:39.295
Nobody can eat

14:37.293 --> 14:39.295
two big-n-beefys.

14:39.337 --> 14:42.131
Not with fries.

14:39.337 --> 14:42.131
Whatever.

14:42.965 --> 14:45.134
Come on, Henry.

14:42.965 --> 14:45.134
Let's go rescue your friend.

14:46.636 --> 14:50.390
I... I can't go with you.

14:46.636 --> 14:50.390
Why can't you?

14:50.431 --> 14:53.017
Because Jasper

14:50.431 --> 14:53.017
really likes that girl.

14:53.059 --> 14:54.602
So?

14:54.644 --> 14:56.730
He made her think

14:54.644 --> 14:56.730
that he's Kid Danger.

14:56.771 --> 14:58.523
So, now if I show up there

14:56.771 --> 14:58.523
with you

14:58.565 --> 15:00.233
she's gonna know

14:58.565 --> 15:00.233
he was lying.

15:00.274 --> 15:01.942
Don't you think Jasper

15:00.274 --> 15:01.942
should find a girl

15:01.984 --> 15:04.487
who likes him

15:01.984 --> 15:04.487
for who he really is?

15:04.529 --> 15:06.406
You know that's never

15:04.529 --> 15:06.406
gonna happen.

15:07.699 --> 15:10.368
All right.

15:07.699 --> 15:10.368
I'll go rescue your friend.

15:10.410 --> 15:12.078
Okay.

15:10.410 --> 15:12.078
But when you're there,

15:12.119 --> 15:14.080
you got to act like Jasper's

15:12.119 --> 15:14.080
the real Kid Danger.

15:14.121 --> 15:16.165
I know how to act.

15:25.216 --> 15:26.217
Good luck.

15:26.467 --> 15:28.969
I don't need luck.

15:26.467 --> 15:28.969
It's Jeff.

15:33.057 --> 15:34.475
Up the tube.

15:40.690 --> 15:42.442
Hey...

15:42.483 --> 15:44.318
I have to go take my nephew

15:42.483 --> 15:44.318
to a Halloween party.

15:46.613 --> 15:47.906
Later.

15:56.330 --> 15:59.459
Well, I guess I should

15:56.330 --> 15:59.459
get you kids some food.

16:01.795 --> 16:03.045
Ow!

16:03.087 --> 16:04.798
Sorry.

16:05.465 --> 16:06.716
Ow!

16:06.758 --> 16:07.801
Sorry.

16:09.719 --> 16:12.305
I'll go get you guys

16:09.719 --> 16:12.305
some corn chips.

16:12.680 --> 16:14.390
I think I left them

16:12.680 --> 16:14.390
in my bathroom.

16:15.725 --> 16:17.059
When you get back here,

16:17.101 --> 16:19.061
Kid Danger's gonna

16:17.101 --> 16:19.061
smash your head in.

16:21.230 --> 16:23.608
She's just joking.

16:21.230 --> 16:23.608
She loves comedy.

16:27.445 --> 16:29.614
Okay, he's out of the room,

16:27.445 --> 16:29.614
make your move.

16:30.323 --> 16:31.198
Okay.

16:32.742 --> 16:33.910
Not on me!

16:36.120 --> 16:37.997
Please?

16:38.038 --> 16:39.666
Come on, just break

16:38.038 --> 16:39.666
through your ropes

16:39.707 --> 16:41.626
and go all Kid Danger

16:39.707 --> 16:41.626
on that guy.

16:41.668 --> 16:44.754
But... He's so big.

16:44.796 --> 16:47.632
So? You're a superhero.

16:47.674 --> 16:49.300
Sidekick, baby.

16:50.343 --> 16:53.721
That's like a significant

16:50.343 --> 16:53.721
notch down from a superhero.

16:55.640 --> 16:57.433
I found the chips.

17:01.061 --> 17:02.522
I don't want--

17:06.192 --> 17:07.777
I don't want that.

17:11.113 --> 17:13.324
Captain Man.

17:11.113 --> 17:13.324
Uh-oh.

17:14.951 --> 17:16.076
(groaning)

17:22.291 --> 17:24.711
Dude, the door

17:22.291 --> 17:24.711
wasn't even locked.

17:26.337 --> 17:27.588
I know, Jeff.

17:27.630 --> 17:30.466
But I don't like you,

17:27.630 --> 17:30.466
so I smashed your door.

17:32.134 --> 17:33.177
I don't see

17:32.134 --> 17:33.177
any hamburgers.

17:33.219 --> 17:34.804
Where are my big-n-beefys?

17:34.846 --> 17:37.015
The only thing you're going

17:34.846 --> 17:37.015
to get that's big and beefy

17:37.056 --> 17:38.558
will be your cell mate in jail.

17:39.642 --> 17:41.895
Okay, well, when do

17:39.642 --> 17:41.895
I get my million dollars?

17:43.145 --> 17:45.565
Okay, you're too stupid

17:43.145 --> 17:45.565
to talk to. Sit.

17:46.733 --> 17:50.236
Hey, Kid Danger,

17:46.733 --> 17:50.236
I was worried about you.

17:51.905 --> 17:56.158
Thanks, boss.

17:51.905 --> 17:56.158
I was worried about you, too.

17:56.200 --> 17:58.285
Well, I knew

17:56.200 --> 17:58.285
you didn't need me

17:58.327 --> 18:01.247
to take down

17:58.327 --> 18:01.247
a petty criminal like Jeff.

18:02.040 --> 18:03.416
Oh, yeah.

18:03.457 --> 18:05.292
I was just about to bust out

18:03.457 --> 18:05.292
of those ropes

18:05.334 --> 18:07.169
and rain down

18:05.334 --> 18:07.169
some pain on that dude.

18:07.545 --> 18:09.422
Okay, Kid Danger...

18:07.545 --> 18:09.422
Go to it.

18:12.383 --> 18:15.053
Huh?

18:12.383 --> 18:15.053
Go show that criminal

18:12.383 --> 18:15.053
who's boss.

18:15.595 --> 18:17.972
Yeah, Kid Danger,

18:15.595 --> 18:17.972
go bust him up.

18:20.391 --> 18:21.976
I love it when boys fight.

18:22.936 --> 18:24.311
Okay...

18:26.064 --> 18:29.149
This is what you get

18:26.064 --> 18:29.149
for breaking into people's cars

18:29.191 --> 18:31.778
and for kidnapping us

18:29.191 --> 18:31.778
on Halloween.

18:31.819 --> 18:34.906
(grunts)

18:36.783 --> 18:37.909
Whoa!

18:39.243 --> 18:40.870
That was

18:39.243 --> 18:40.870
for you, Monica.

18:42.038 --> 18:45.833
Way to go, K-D.

18:42.038 --> 18:45.833
Yay, great job, Kid Danger.

18:45.875 --> 18:47.543
Hey, can I talk to you

18:45.875 --> 18:47.543
for a second?

18:48.669 --> 18:51.047
Yeah, sure.

18:48.669 --> 18:51.047
My boss needs me.

18:54.174 --> 18:55.134
Listen, Captain Man...

18:55.802 --> 18:56.594
Yes?

18:58.512 --> 19:00.807
I'm not really

18:58.512 --> 19:00.807
Kid Danger.

19:00.848 --> 19:02.141
I know that.

19:03.517 --> 19:06.437
Now, don't you think

19:03.517 --> 19:06.437
you should tell someone else?

19:09.690 --> 19:12.693
But if I tell her the truth,

19:09.690 --> 19:12.693
she won't like me anymore.

19:14.361 --> 19:16.280
How old are you, son?

19:14.361 --> 19:16.280
13.

19:17.073 --> 19:19.617
Then you're way too young

19:17.073 --> 19:19.617
to be lying to girls.

19:22.495 --> 19:25.123
Okay. I'll tell her.

19:22.495 --> 19:25.123
Good boy.

19:27.041 --> 19:29.460
All right, I'm going to take

19:27.041 --> 19:29.460
this idiot back to jail.

19:31.129 --> 19:32.463
Get up, stupid.

19:35.508 --> 19:37.093
All right, you know what?

19:37.135 --> 19:40.554
You are riding my last nerve.

19:37.135 --> 19:40.554
Come on. Stop that. Get up.

19:43.850 --> 19:47.854
Okay. Just get her up.

19:43.850 --> 19:47.854
Careful not to drop her.

19:48.562 --> 19:50.106
Not to what?

19:48.562 --> 19:50.106
Drop her.

19:50.148 --> 19:51.065
Okay.

19:56.403 --> 19:57.864
You said drop her.

19:57.905 --> 20:00.992
No, I said--

19:57.905 --> 20:00.992
oh, forget it.

20:01.034 --> 20:02.035
Let's just take her to--

20:03.202 --> 20:05.121
she's waking up.

20:03.202 --> 20:05.121
Yeah.

20:05.163 --> 20:06.497
Because you dropped her.

20:08.332 --> 20:11.251
What happened?

20:14.047 --> 20:16.716
You ate some bad candy.

20:19.259 --> 20:21.387
Real bad candy.

20:23.681 --> 20:26.600
Why are you guys

20:23.681 --> 20:26.600
so close to my face?

20:31.731 --> 20:35.442
There you go. All free.

20:31.731 --> 20:35.442
Thanks.

20:36.402 --> 20:38.905
So, before, when Captain Man

20:36.402 --> 20:38.905
took you into the kitchen...

20:38.946 --> 20:40.198
Yeah?

20:40.239 --> 20:41.657
What were you guys

20:40.239 --> 20:41.657
talking about?

20:42.783 --> 20:45.619
Well... See...

20:48.288 --> 20:49.790
He gave me a raise.

20:50.917 --> 20:53.252
No way.

20:50.917 --> 20:53.252
Yep. That's what happened.

20:54.253 --> 20:56.255
I'm really proud of you,

20:54.253 --> 20:56.255
Kid Danger.

20:56.296 --> 20:58.841
Well... I earned it.

21:01.385 --> 21:02.887
(Piper)

21:01.385 --> 21:02.887
Henry!

21:02.929 --> 21:04.513
I've already answered

21:02.929 --> 21:04.513
all your questions.

21:04.555 --> 21:07.307
I want the truth.

21:04.555 --> 21:07.307
Will you just let it go?

21:07.349 --> 21:11.270
No. I don't think

21:07.349 --> 21:11.270
I ate any bad candy.

21:11.604 --> 21:12.855
Well, you did.

21:12.897 --> 21:14.356
Well, I'm going

21:12.897 --> 21:14.356
to tell Mom and Dad--

21:14.398 --> 21:16.234
Excuse me.

21:14.398 --> 21:16.234
Excuse me, kids?

21:16.275 --> 21:17.985
Are you guys trick or treaters

21:16.275 --> 21:17.985
or do you live here?

21:18.027 --> 21:20.362
Oh, we live here.

21:18.027 --> 21:20.362
Just what do you want?

21:22.073 --> 21:23.866
Well, I know it's already

21:22.073 --> 21:23.866
after 9:00,

21:23.908 --> 21:26.202
but my kid and I got

21:23.908 --> 21:26.202
a late start trick or treating

21:26.244 --> 21:29.205
and I was wondering if

21:26.244 --> 21:29.205
you're still giving out candy.

21:29.247 --> 21:32.250
Oh, I can check inside and--

21:29.247 --> 21:32.250
Wait, shut up.

21:34.501 --> 21:36.921
Your costume...

21:34.501 --> 21:36.921
Are you?

21:36.963 --> 21:38.547
Jonathan Swift.

21:39.548 --> 21:41.217
I'm Jonathan swift.

21:41.259 --> 21:42.718
Cool.

21:42.760 --> 21:44.595
Let's hang.

21:42.760 --> 21:44.595
Okay.

21:46.097 --> 21:48.682
Piper! I didn't say you could

21:46.097 --> 21:48.682
hang out with--

21:50.768 --> 21:51.518
Good luck.

21:52.728 --> 21:54.480
No worries.

21:52.728 --> 21:54.480
I'll keep an eye on the kids.

21:57.441 --> 22:00.653
(howling)

22:33.393 --> 22:34.352
(oven bell dings)

22:34.394 --> 22:35.229
(man)

22:34.394 --> 22:35.229
Mmm..
