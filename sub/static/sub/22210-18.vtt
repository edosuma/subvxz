WEBVTT

00:02.169 --> 00:06.209
<i>My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

00:06.298 --> 00:09.166
<i>To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,</i>

00:09.259 --> 00:12.252
<i>but secretly, with the help of
my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

00:12.346 --> 00:15.089
<i>I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.</i>

00:15.182 --> 00:17.390
<i>But I became lost in time.</i>

00:17.476 --> 00:20.219
<i>It took everything in my friends'
power to bring me back.</i>

00:20.312 --> 00:23.350
<i>And in doing so, our world
was opened up to new threats.</i>

00:23.440 --> 00:26.148
<i>And I'm the only one fast enough
to stop them.</i>

00:26.235 --> 00:28.192
<i>I am the Flash.</i>

00:29.530 --> 00:30.941
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

00:31.031 --> 00:32.442
Just one more bus meta out there.

00:32.533 --> 00:34.820
Edwin Gauss.
We better find him before DeVoe does.

00:34.910 --> 00:36.446
This is an intelligence booster.

00:36.537 --> 00:38.779
You're talking about intense
amounts of dark energy

00:38.872 --> 00:40.488
<i>going right into that cap.</i>

00:40.582 --> 00:41.698
I'm gonna help you finish
the thinking cap

00:41.792 --> 00:43.078
without using dark matter.

00:43.168 --> 00:44.158
Fine.

00:45.879 --> 00:47.211
Good evening, Dr. Wells.

00:47.297 --> 00:48.504
How can I be of service?

00:48.590 --> 00:49.751
Hello, Gideon.

00:53.804 --> 00:58.299
Good ol' CCTA bus number 405,
where I was gifted with pretty much

00:58.392 --> 00:59.553
the best powers ever.

00:59.643 --> 01:00.884
If it wasn't for this old girl,

01:00.978 --> 01:03.265
I'd still have to leave the couch
when I need to use the bathroom.

01:03.605 --> 01:05.972
- You know, because I can...
- Yes, I know.

01:06.358 --> 01:07.940
All right, this might be
our last chance

01:08.026 --> 01:09.517
to find any clues
on the final bus meta

01:09.611 --> 01:12.228
- before DeVoe catches him.
- Yeah, we know what happens next.

01:12.322 --> 01:13.688
What do we know about this meta?

01:14.324 --> 01:17.908
Other than his name, Edwin Gauss?
Nothing, it's like he disappeared.

01:19.079 --> 01:21.787
Well, that explains the brand-new
beepy flashy schmancies.

01:21.873 --> 01:24.616
Cisco designed these scanners
to look for dark matter anomalies,

01:24.710 --> 01:26.167
so anything that looks
weird, all right?

01:26.253 --> 01:29.212
Waves, ripples, whatever, log it.

01:30.299 --> 01:31.415
Oh!

01:31.508 --> 01:32.840
- I got something.
- What?

01:33.260 --> 01:34.501
My Big Belly punch card.

01:34.595 --> 01:36.507
Only five away
from a free kids' meal.

01:36.847 --> 01:38.304
If I even live long enough to use it.

01:38.724 --> 01:41.182
Man, don't even joke like that,
we're gonna get DeVoe.

01:41.268 --> 01:43.180
Throw him in the Pipeline,
long before he gets to you.

01:43.478 --> 01:46.596
Right, if that doesn't work, we'll
just take him out the other way.

01:46.815 --> 01:47.805
What other way?

01:48.066 --> 01:49.182
We'll put him down with a shovel.

01:49.276 --> 01:51.313
Give him his harp and wings,
send him to visit

01:51.403 --> 01:52.894
Grandma Thinker in the sky.

01:54.740 --> 01:56.106
Ralph, you think
we're gonna kill DeVoe?

01:58.577 --> 02:00.034
The way that you're saying that
makes me think

02:00.120 --> 02:01.156
I'm supposed to say no?

02:02.789 --> 02:03.870
Okay, look.

02:04.374 --> 02:06.536
I've taught you a lot
about being a hero, right?

02:06.627 --> 02:09.586
You ready for what's
probably the most important lesson?

02:10.631 --> 02:11.917
We never have to kill.

02:13.216 --> 02:15.503
For people with our abilities,
there's just always another way.

02:15.844 --> 02:16.834
You understand?

02:19.222 --> 02:21.635
Allen, you complete me.

02:21.725 --> 02:22.715
- Bring it in.
- I'm good.

02:22.809 --> 02:24.300
- Thank you.
- Just a little bit.

02:24.394 --> 02:25.601
Come on. Okay.

02:26.438 --> 02:27.770
What's this?

02:32.444 --> 02:33.434
Wait a second.

02:34.363 --> 02:35.899
I talked to the guy
who was sitting there.

02:35.989 --> 02:37.730
I remember 'cause I paid his fare.

02:40.786 --> 02:42.118
Uh... U-oh.

02:43.038 --> 02:45.655
I think I may have left my wallet
in my other pants.

02:45.749 --> 02:48.366
Look, buddy, either pay the fare,
or you hit the sidewalk.

02:48.460 --> 02:49.826
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

02:49.920 --> 02:51.411
Mr. Bus Driver, dude.

02:51.755 --> 02:54.498
Allow me to pay his fare.

02:55.258 --> 02:57.124
Who are we to be the gatekeepers

02:57.386 --> 03:00.094
of whatever path
this fellow traveler is on?

03:01.264 --> 03:02.596
Have a seat.

03:05.310 --> 03:07.347
Uh... Thanks.

03:07.437 --> 03:08.678
<i>Namaste, hermano.</i>

03:08.772 --> 03:10.764
<i>Namaste</i> in the back of the bus.

03:11.400 --> 03:12.811
You're a funny fat dude.

03:14.820 --> 03:17.688
This is crazy, his residual
dark matter reads as if

03:17.781 --> 03:20.740
he was here one second
and the next, vanished.

03:23.537 --> 03:25.620
It's Harry, he wants us back
at S.T.A.R. Labs.

03:25.706 --> 03:27.698
Says he got something important
to show everyone.

03:27.791 --> 03:30.033
Well, now so do we.

03:31.211 --> 03:32.873
Yeah, right, come on.

03:34.047 --> 03:36.164
THE FLASH

03:40.178 --> 03:41.168
That's the big news?

03:41.263 --> 03:43.505
You're taking a sculpture class
at the community college?

03:43.598 --> 03:45.055
It's not art.

03:45.142 --> 03:47.099
It's science! And as such,

03:47.936 --> 03:50.303
it is the thing that
is going to help us defeat...

03:52.357 --> 03:53.347
DeVoe.

03:53.984 --> 03:57.898
Recall, if you will, the one thing
that we've seen, nay, heard,

03:58.405 --> 03:59.691
that can actually harm DeVoe.

04:00.031 --> 04:01.397
Izzy Bowin's sound wave powers.

04:01.491 --> 04:03.232
No, Izzy was killed by DeVoe,
so whatever power she had

04:03.326 --> 04:04.362
is in his hands now.

04:04.453 --> 04:08.697
And now, Joe, they're in ours.

04:09.416 --> 04:10.577
Watch this.

04:10.917 --> 04:11.907
So...

04:13.253 --> 04:14.619
Maybe you should

04:15.422 --> 04:17.584
take a couple of steps back
if you value your internal organs.

04:27.893 --> 04:28.883
I know how that feels.

04:31.605 --> 04:32.641
One strike

04:33.064 --> 04:34.896
incapacitates The Thinker. Two strikes,

04:35.525 --> 04:39.314
no more Thinker.
I call it a Sonic Scepter.

04:40.739 --> 04:43.527
Okay, points for alliteration.

04:43.617 --> 04:45.108
Basically just a big tuning fork.

04:45.202 --> 04:46.192
My goodness.

04:46.286 --> 04:50.781
It's not just any tuning fork.
This might be the most powerful

04:50.874 --> 04:52.240
tuning fork in the multiverse.

04:52.334 --> 04:54.542
You must've laser shaved
this thing down to the nano.

04:54.628 --> 04:56.290
Shaved it right down to the last
angstrom as a matter of fact,

04:56.379 --> 04:58.416
child's play for me
and my thinking cap.

04:58.507 --> 05:01.045
The Sonic Scepter mimics
Izzy Bowin's sonic frequencies,

05:01.134 --> 05:03.501
so we can penetrate
a heretofore impenetrable

05:03.595 --> 05:04.881
force field of DeVoe.

05:04.971 --> 05:07.679
And here's the best part.
Because there's no tech involved...

05:07.766 --> 05:09.007
It's Kilg%re proof.

05:09.100 --> 05:10.261
- Yes.
- Nice.

05:10.352 --> 05:12.890
So, now we just need to figure out
where DeVoe is gonna appear next.

05:12.979 --> 05:14.720
As a matter of fact,
before you got here,

05:14.815 --> 05:17.649
I've scripted a subroutine
on the pocket dimension predictor

05:17.734 --> 05:19.350
and it's gonna give us
a massive head start.

05:19.778 --> 05:21.189
DeVoe's next location, thank you.

05:21.530 --> 05:23.192
Yesterday, I thought you said
that was impossible.

05:23.281 --> 05:25.523
That's right, Snow,
I did say that yesterday,

05:25.617 --> 05:26.858
but today...

05:27.619 --> 05:29.485
Is a new day.
I've got a million new ideas.

05:29.579 --> 05:30.660
The cap and I are...

05:32.457 --> 05:34.870
Firing on all cylinders.

05:34.960 --> 05:37.247
Onward and upward.

05:39.214 --> 05:40.750
Okay, let's get to it.

05:40.841 --> 05:42.958
Cisco, can you integrate
Harry's algorithm

05:43.051 --> 05:44.713
- into the predictor?
- Can do.

05:44.803 --> 05:45.793
Okay.

05:48.557 --> 05:49.764
Hey.

05:51.643 --> 05:55.057
Harry's really loving
that thinking cap, huh?

05:55.146 --> 05:58.264
Oh, my God, it's like
the best friend he never had.

05:58.358 --> 06:00.645
I mean, he wears this thing
everywhere, I'm pretty sure

06:00.735 --> 06:02.317
I saw him step out
of the shower with it.

06:02.863 --> 06:04.980
I wanna know what kind of problem
he was trying to solve in there.

06:05.991 --> 06:09.610
No, no, I don't wanna know.

06:15.750 --> 06:16.911
What are you working on?

06:17.002 --> 06:18.834
My brain. Or brains.

06:18.920 --> 06:21.333
I think I've finally figured out
the science behind what

06:21.423 --> 06:22.504
activates Killer Frost.

06:22.799 --> 06:25.837
So, in fight or flight,
the adrenal glands flood the body

06:25.927 --> 06:28.294
with catecholamines,
AKA the stress hormone,

06:28.388 --> 06:30.755
and guess where the highest
concentration of dark matter is

06:30.849 --> 06:31.965
in my body?

06:32.309 --> 06:33.470
In your adrenal glands?

06:33.560 --> 06:34.801
Exactly. So,

06:34.895 --> 06:37.729
if adrenaline is what activates
Killer Frost, then all I need...

06:37.814 --> 06:39.100
Is a shot of epinephrine?

06:39.190 --> 06:42.774
No more Harry and Cisco traumatizing
me to get Killer Frost to show up.

06:43.111 --> 06:44.101
Can't wait to tell her.

06:44.821 --> 06:46.562
Wait, you guys talk now?

06:46.656 --> 06:49.740
Sort of. We leave each other notes.

06:51.953 --> 06:54.912
"Thanks for the badass new jacket,
I got some blood on it.

06:54.998 --> 06:56.739
"Don't worry, it's not ours."

06:59.461 --> 07:02.454
I guess her humor
is sort of an acquired taste.

07:04.007 --> 07:05.123
Uh-oh.

07:05.216 --> 07:06.582
Pocket dimension is about to open.

07:06.676 --> 07:08.508
It's DeVoe, get that pen ready.

07:14.100 --> 07:15.841
Okay, stay ready.

07:36.581 --> 07:37.742
Edwin Gauss?

07:43.254 --> 07:44.335
What?

07:49.344 --> 07:51.927
All right, guys, say hello
to our last known bus meta,

07:52.013 --> 07:54.175
Edwin Gauss. As we know,
there's not much on him.

07:54.265 --> 07:56.177
No college history,
no known addresses,

07:56.267 --> 07:58.680
just a couple of backpacking photos
on an old message board.

07:58.770 --> 08:01.638
Old? Flip phones are old,
this site is from the age

08:01.731 --> 08:03.814
of dial-up. Try prehistoric.

08:03.900 --> 08:06.233
No digital fingerprint,
everything this guy owns

08:06.319 --> 08:07.435
is strapped to his back.

08:07.529 --> 08:09.862
He was off-grid before
he was even a meta.

08:09.948 --> 08:12.986
That and his powers are
the reason that we couldn't find him.

08:13.076 --> 08:14.692
And why there were
12 heat signatures

08:14.786 --> 08:16.368
on the bus, including the driver.

08:16.746 --> 08:18.533
Cisco, the way he appeared
and disappeared.

08:18.623 --> 08:19.659
Pocket dimension.

08:19.749 --> 08:21.706
What, like the DeVoe kind?

08:21.793 --> 08:24.285
No, like the Edwin Gauss kind.

08:24.379 --> 08:27.122
You see, pocket dimensions
like the one you see here

08:27.215 --> 08:28.877
are unique to their users.

08:28.967 --> 08:31.960
Just like DeVoe can only enter
or exit his,

08:32.053 --> 08:35.217
Gauss, too, is limited
to his own pocket dimension.

08:35.306 --> 08:36.717
So, why does DeVoe need him?

08:36.808 --> 08:40.097
Well, DeVoe uses his chair
to create pocket dimensions.

08:40.186 --> 08:43.099
If he has Edwin Gauss' powers,
he won't need it anymore.

08:43.188 --> 08:44.680
Then we need to catch Gauss first.

08:44.774 --> 08:45.890
And we will.

08:45.984 --> 08:48.692
Little late, just tweaking
the cap. Now, listen,

08:49.029 --> 08:51.066
locating this meta is not a task
that we have to accomplish.

08:51.156 --> 08:53.022
"Why is that, Harry?"
I'll tell you why,

08:53.116 --> 08:55.733
it's because we already have.

08:55.827 --> 08:57.784
Now, this is the map that we constructed

08:57.871 --> 09:00.033
of all the pocket dimension activity
throughout Central City.

09:00.123 --> 09:02.206
Right, but that's when we thought
all the pocket dimensions

09:02.292 --> 09:04.750
belong to DeVoe, now we don't know
whether they belong to him

09:04.836 --> 09:06.247
- or to Gauss.
- And figuring out

09:06.337 --> 09:08.920
those distinctions, sorry,
but that's too big even

09:09.007 --> 09:11.090
- for your britches, Harry.
- My britches are plenty big.

09:11.176 --> 09:14.010
Okay? I fill my britches,
watch this, okay.

09:14.095 --> 09:16.508
By simply tracking the
trillions of identifiers,

09:16.598 --> 09:19.136
cross-referencing the fluctuation
migration patterns

09:19.225 --> 09:20.636
and the temporal displacement
and energy...

09:20.727 --> 09:21.808
And...

09:22.395 --> 09:26.730
I give you Edwin Gauss'
pocket dimension activity.

09:28.276 --> 09:31.769
"Ah! Harry, it's amazing."

09:32.864 --> 09:35.777
Yeah, let's all just split up
and search each one

09:35.867 --> 09:38.405
for Edwin Gauss.
Barry you take Caitlin and Ralph,

09:38.495 --> 09:40.452
and I'll go with Cisco
and my dad, Harry.

09:40.538 --> 09:41.949
- I'll go with you.
- No, I was thinking that

09:42.040 --> 09:44.248
you could just stay here
and hold down the fort.

09:44.334 --> 09:45.791
Okay, I'll tweak the cap.

09:54.803 --> 09:56.669
Detective, are you not going
after Gauss?

09:56.763 --> 09:58.720
I'm on my way out,
I just wanted to see

09:58.807 --> 10:00.298
if you needed anything
before we left.

10:01.184 --> 10:02.470
If I need? No, I'm good.

10:03.311 --> 10:05.394
Holding that thinking cap real close.

10:05.480 --> 10:07.267
Never know when you might need it.

10:07.440 --> 10:10.558
You only need it for
DeVoe-related problems, right?

10:11.152 --> 10:13.064
DeVoe-related problems,
science problems.

10:13.154 --> 10:14.486
Making the perfect omelet.

10:15.365 --> 10:16.651
You make omelets with that cap?

10:16.741 --> 10:17.857
Yeah.

10:17.951 --> 10:18.941
Pretty darn good omelet.

10:19.285 --> 10:20.742
I bet. Hey.

10:21.788 --> 10:23.780
- Do you mind if I borrow the cap?
- No, I don't think so.

10:24.082 --> 10:25.618
- Not a good idea.
- Why not?

10:25.875 --> 10:26.911
It seems pretty easy to use.

10:27.001 --> 10:28.993
Detective, this "easy-to-use"
thing is actually

10:29.087 --> 10:31.420
a delicate scientific instrument
that directly alters

10:31.506 --> 10:33.338
the brain wave of the user,
so I don't think so.

10:33.424 --> 10:34.585
Hmm.

10:34.676 --> 10:36.417
- So, it's dangerous?
- Yeah, it's very dangerous.

10:36.719 --> 10:39.632
And yet you risked using it
to make breakfast?

10:45.186 --> 10:48.350
All right. Okay, you're good, Detective.

10:49.315 --> 10:50.351
How much do you wear that cap?

10:50.441 --> 10:52.307
I'm not overusing it
if that's what you're asking.

10:52.402 --> 10:55.065
Overusing is one way of putting it,
addiction is another.

10:55.155 --> 10:56.441
I'm not addicted to...

10:58.783 --> 11:00.149
Your concerns are well-founded.

11:00.243 --> 11:01.950
Ramon had the same concern.
I told him...

11:02.036 --> 11:04.824
No, I promised him
I would not use this thinking cap

11:05.165 --> 11:06.155
with dark matter.

11:06.708 --> 11:09.041
- Hmm. And that's a promise you kept?
- Yes.

11:11.129 --> 11:13.291
I don't mean to be paranoid.

11:13.798 --> 11:16.836
Sometimes it's just hard
to turn off the cop brain.

11:17.594 --> 11:19.210
I get it. No worries.

11:20.805 --> 11:22.171
Good luck finding Gauss.

11:42.285 --> 11:43.446
Guys.

11:44.120 --> 11:45.406
Where are we?

11:45.496 --> 11:47.658
Looks like some
sort of hippie commune.

11:47.749 --> 11:48.865
Yeah. Smells like one too.

11:48.958 --> 11:50.449
I think I figured out DeVoe's plan.

11:50.543 --> 11:51.579
He means to suffocate us

11:51.669 --> 11:53.080
with B.O. and incense.

11:53.379 --> 11:55.996
Well, this is the last pocket
dimension hot spot on our list.

11:56.090 --> 11:58.833
So just... Do you see Gauss anywhere?

12:01.346 --> 12:02.962
Unwashed flower child.

12:03.056 --> 12:04.513
Have you seen this man?

12:05.141 --> 12:06.257
No.

12:07.268 --> 12:10.602
I've seen the soul that belongs
to this man.

12:11.314 --> 12:13.101
Dude's aura is a trip.

12:13.191 --> 12:14.978
Wait, so you know Edwin Gauss?

12:15.068 --> 12:16.309
Sure do.

12:16.736 --> 12:18.352
Around here, we call him

12:18.613 --> 12:20.400
"The Folded Man."

12:21.532 --> 12:23.945
- Folded man?
- He's everywhere.

12:24.702 --> 12:26.284
And nowhere.

12:27.664 --> 12:29.280
But mostly he's around here.

12:30.208 --> 12:33.827
Time for the reflection hike,
everyone, don't forget to leash

12:33.920 --> 12:36.003
your spirit animals.

12:37.173 --> 12:38.880
Literally already smells better.

12:39.259 --> 12:42.343
Okay, let's just search for Gauss
and stay in touch over the comms.

12:42.553 --> 12:44.886
Yeah, I will leash my inner
penguin spirit animal

12:44.973 --> 12:46.384
and head south.

12:47.350 --> 12:48.511
Be careful.

12:49.102 --> 12:50.263
Don't touch anybody.

12:53.273 --> 12:55.560
Okay, remember
if we find Gauss first,

12:55.650 --> 12:57.767
we might be able
to put an end to DeVoe's plans.

12:57.860 --> 12:59.476
Speaking of ending DeVoe...

12:59.570 --> 13:01.607
- It's not what I said.
- Allen, I'm just saying

13:01.698 --> 13:03.860
DeVoe has been ahead of us
at every turn, his backup plans

13:03.950 --> 13:05.612
have backup plans. On the off chance

13:05.702 --> 13:06.943
that we can't capture him,

13:07.036 --> 13:08.527
shouldn't we be willing to do
whatever it takes?

13:08.621 --> 13:09.987
- We know that he is.
- I am willing to do

13:10.081 --> 13:13.040
whatever it takes, except kill DeVoe.

13:13.126 --> 13:14.992
- Even in self-defense?
- It's not self-defense

13:15.086 --> 13:16.452
if you're already thinking about it.

13:16.546 --> 13:17.878
Look.

13:18.798 --> 13:21.131
I've been down this road,
I know you're scared,

13:21.217 --> 13:22.674
I understand the temptation,

13:22.760 --> 13:26.128
but you have to hear me when
I say there's always another way.

13:30.184 --> 13:31.846
I really hope you're right, rookie.

13:32.854 --> 13:34.641
<i>Guys, I've got eyes on Gauss!</i>

13:34.731 --> 13:36.893
He's fast for a non-speedster.

13:39.068 --> 13:40.400
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

13:40.611 --> 13:41.977
Easy narcs, hey.

13:42.905 --> 13:44.817
- I give up.
- We're not cops.

13:45.533 --> 13:47.616
But you are in danger,
we are here to protect you.

13:47.702 --> 13:49.819
Oh. Righteous.

13:49.912 --> 13:52.279
Is that why you brought
your ninja buddy?

13:52.373 --> 13:53.614
What?

14:03.176 --> 14:04.292
Caitlin.

14:04.385 --> 14:05.671
Meet us at S.T.A.R. Labs.

14:07.138 --> 14:09.380
<i>You can't stop me, Mr. Dibny.</i>

14:09.640 --> 14:13.475
<i>I'll cut through all of Team Flash
to get what I want.</i>

14:20.193 --> 14:21.229
Are you sure you're okay?

14:21.319 --> 14:24.062
Yeah, I mean the wound started
healing before I even woke up.

14:24.155 --> 14:25.862
You frosted out for a sec
when we got here,

14:25.948 --> 14:27.189
- it probably helped.
- Yeah.

14:28.284 --> 14:30.401
Hey, shouldn't you rest?

14:30.703 --> 14:32.194
Honestly, I'm fine.

14:32.288 --> 14:34.280
If anything, this has just made
me more determined

14:34.374 --> 14:36.457
to get DeVoe. I'm gonna
go help Cisco with that

14:36.542 --> 14:37.908
pocket dimension predictor.

14:40.463 --> 14:42.500
Well, it could've gone worse.

14:42.590 --> 14:44.877
Yeah, all things considered,
we got pretty lucky.

14:44.967 --> 14:46.003
Yeah.

14:46.135 --> 14:48.673
Lucky? Are you two serious?

14:49.097 --> 14:51.259
Am I the only one
who's paying attention here?

14:51.349 --> 14:53.306
Ralph, the mission was successful.

14:53.684 --> 14:56.392
Caitlin's okay and Edwin
agreed to stay in the Pipeline.

14:56.479 --> 14:57.845
Edwin will be safe in there.

14:57.939 --> 15:01.103
Safe. Because DeVoe
has never successfully attacked

15:01.192 --> 15:03.434
metas in a maximum security
facility before.

15:03.528 --> 15:05.736
Wait, he did exactly that.

15:05.822 --> 15:07.734
- Watch it, Ralph.
- I have been watching.

15:08.032 --> 15:09.819
Watching DeVoe ahead of us
at every turn,

15:09.909 --> 15:12.492
watching Caitlin get skewered,
watching the metas drop

15:12.578 --> 15:15.912
like flies one by one,
because we can't save them.

15:15.998 --> 15:19.582
And why? Because we won't make
the tough call and end DeVoe

15:19.669 --> 15:21.126
- when we get the chance.
- Look, I'm not doing this.

15:21.212 --> 15:24.046
Okay, Ralph, I get where
you're coming from.

15:24.132 --> 15:26.590
But that is not the tough call,
that is the wrong one.

15:26.676 --> 15:29.589
Mr. and Mrs. S.T.A.R. Labs agree.

15:29.804 --> 15:31.215
I swear, if I was running this team...

15:31.305 --> 15:32.921
- But you're not!
- Okay, all right. That's enough.

15:33.015 --> 15:35.473
We don't have time for this, okay?
We need to focus

15:35.560 --> 15:37.017
and stick to the game plan.

15:37.103 --> 15:39.971
Find DeVoe, hit him with the scepter
and put him in the Pipeline.

15:40.064 --> 15:41.350
No one has to die.

15:43.276 --> 15:44.642
Same plan again.

15:45.319 --> 15:47.811
And you wonder
why he's always ahead of us.

16:13.848 --> 16:14.838
Yo.

16:15.433 --> 16:17.015
Magnum, P.I.

16:17.351 --> 16:21.311
I am digging this
tiny padded room, bro.

16:21.397 --> 16:24.640
It's like an eggshell for my body.

16:24.984 --> 16:27.772
Which is the eggshell for my soul.

16:28.946 --> 16:32.405
Which contains the universe
on this...

16:32.492 --> 16:35.701
Zesty Ranch.

16:35.828 --> 16:36.944
Right on.

16:37.538 --> 16:40.030
You strike me
as a munchies kind of guy.

16:41.417 --> 16:45.001
Guilty. Wait, wait,
not actually guilty,

16:45.087 --> 16:49.001
it's not like I'm on anything.
You guys said you aren't cops, right?

16:49.258 --> 16:50.749
- Nope.
- All right.

16:50.843 --> 16:52.960
But apparently we have to follow
more rules than they do.

16:53.054 --> 16:56.593
Well, whatever rules protect me
from the evil genius dude,

16:56.682 --> 16:58.093
I shall heed.

16:58.184 --> 17:00.050
Even his name is creepy.

17:00.645 --> 17:02.432
The Ponderer.

17:02.855 --> 17:04.721
It's Thinker.

17:05.273 --> 17:06.935
Yeah, sure is a thinker.

17:07.026 --> 17:10.440
Make me think about my journey,
like first time I folded,

17:10.530 --> 17:14.398
I was in this white space for days,
and then another time,

17:14.492 --> 17:18.531
I tumbled down this ramp
in this space-agey room

17:18.621 --> 17:21.079
with blue lights and there was
this bald dude and a professor,

17:21.165 --> 17:24.282
exploding chair with tubes coming out
of his noggin,

17:24.377 --> 17:28.462
and there was this lady
in a white lab coat,

17:28.548 --> 17:31.632
with such a hot accent. Ah!

17:31.717 --> 17:33.709
Wait, wait, wait,
Edwin, do you remember anything else

17:33.803 --> 17:35.669
from there? Anything at all?
This is important.

17:37.223 --> 17:40.182
I don't know if this detail
is relevant,

17:40.268 --> 17:42.555
but he had one of those
robot samurai dudes.

17:43.229 --> 17:44.765
You were in DeVoe's lair.

17:45.189 --> 17:47.476
But how can that be?
Cisco said that a pocket dimension

17:47.567 --> 17:49.934
can only be accessed by
a specific user.

17:50.444 --> 17:51.980
I mean, I don't know...

17:52.238 --> 17:54.696
Some places are harder
to get to than others,

17:54.782 --> 17:58.025
but if you set your mind
to a high enough plane,

17:59.370 --> 18:00.360
you can go anywhere.

18:00.454 --> 18:02.116
My mind gets really high.

18:02.206 --> 18:03.822
Edwin, can you get us back there?

18:04.792 --> 18:05.953
For sure.

18:09.171 --> 18:10.332
Come on.

18:11.048 --> 18:12.289
I got more.

18:13.217 --> 18:14.424
I got more.

18:14.677 --> 18:17.215
I cannot do it any faster, Captain.

18:17.597 --> 18:21.307
If I apply any more hobby glue,
this ship is gonna blow!

18:24.228 --> 18:25.344
Wow!

18:25.438 --> 18:27.145
This glue is really something else.

18:27.315 --> 18:28.601
I should probably wear a respirator.

18:30.484 --> 18:31.691
Where is it?

18:31.777 --> 18:34.019
Where is what? The exit?
It's right behind you.

18:34.113 --> 18:36.696
- Please and thank you.
- Can't find my thinking cap.

18:37.950 --> 18:40.738
Hey, I don't have it,
Captain Caveman.

18:43.414 --> 18:44.621
I never said you did.

18:44.707 --> 18:47.290
So, why would you volunteer
that information unless

18:47.376 --> 18:48.583
you do have it.

18:48.669 --> 18:50.251
- Get out.
- I know what this is about.

18:50.338 --> 18:52.500
You never wanted me to build
this sucker in the first place.

18:52.590 --> 18:53.831
'Cause you never wanted
me to be smarter than you,

18:53.924 --> 18:56.883
well, guess what, that's funny,
'cause I already am.

18:57.219 --> 18:58.926
What the hell are you talking about?

19:00.181 --> 19:01.797
- What the hell are you doing?
- Give me my cap!

19:01.891 --> 19:03.974
- Hey.
- Give it to me.

19:04.060 --> 19:05.642
- It's mine, it's my cap!
- Cut it out.

19:05.728 --> 19:06.764
- It's mine!
- Stop!

19:06.854 --> 19:08.140
Harry!

19:08.230 --> 19:09.437
He didn't take it.

19:11.150 --> 19:12.436
I didn't take it.

19:14.320 --> 19:16.528
You definitely have a problem, man.

19:16.614 --> 19:18.071
- Joe, this is fine.
- Be quiet.

19:19.492 --> 19:20.699
Just listen.

19:20.785 --> 19:24.369
I've seen these signs before
with my late wife Francine.

19:25.498 --> 19:27.114
Back then, I didn't intervene

19:27.208 --> 19:30.542
so quickly because I said to myself
I needed to be sure.

19:31.504 --> 19:33.086
But I was sure.

19:33.172 --> 19:37.132
I just didn't want to see those signs
in somebody I cared about.

19:38.469 --> 19:41.177
I can't make you stop using this,
that's up to you.

19:41.806 --> 19:45.425
All I will ask is that you take
a long hard look at what

19:45.518 --> 19:46.884
it's doing to you.

19:47.269 --> 19:49.556
And how it's making you treat people
you care about.

20:00.950 --> 20:02.031
Ramon.

20:19.009 --> 20:21.752
Uh... Where are we going again?

20:22.221 --> 20:25.214
You are gonna open up
a pocket dimension into DeVoe's lair.

20:25.307 --> 20:27.048
And I'm gonna stop him for good.

20:27.601 --> 20:28.808
No, you're not.

20:31.105 --> 20:34.098
Cisco installed motion detectors
in the Pipeline intake.

20:34.191 --> 20:36.103
I thought it was DeVoe
coming for Edwin.

20:37.236 --> 20:38.602
And I kind of wish it was.

20:38.696 --> 20:41.655
Edwin can get me into DeVoe's lair,
I can end this.

20:42.324 --> 20:43.781
All you have to do is let me go.

20:43.868 --> 20:45.234
I can't let you do that.

20:45.327 --> 20:46.613
Um...

20:47.329 --> 20:49.662
Listen, I don't really
do confrontation,

20:49.749 --> 20:51.991
so can I just go back
to my glass cage?

20:52.084 --> 20:53.700
We're both leaving in a second.

20:53.794 --> 20:55.001
Okay.

20:55.713 --> 20:57.124
Just give me the scepter.

20:57.214 --> 20:59.627
You know I can take it away
from you if I have to.

20:59.717 --> 21:00.924
Yeah?

21:04.096 --> 21:05.758
Well, you're going
to have to take it out of me.

21:10.102 --> 21:13.595
Whoa! Bro, okay, I'm actually glad
I stayed for that.

21:13.689 --> 21:15.806
That was trippy.

21:16.525 --> 21:18.141
- Don't do this.
- Do what?

21:18.944 --> 21:19.980
This?

21:42.384 --> 21:43.625
I'm sorry, Ralph.

22:05.324 --> 22:06.610
Olive branch?

22:10.746 --> 22:12.203
You don't want to have
a drink with your buddy?

22:13.249 --> 22:15.536
Is that what you call someone
who just went all

22:15.626 --> 22:16.867
Thor, son of Odin on you?

22:16.961 --> 22:18.918
- You can take it.
- Yeah.

22:23.133 --> 22:24.123
Look.

22:24.552 --> 22:26.088
I know you're worried about DeVoe.

22:26.554 --> 22:28.011
About what he might do to you.

22:29.473 --> 22:31.840
But there are some
lines we can't cross.

22:32.101 --> 22:33.512
Wow.

22:34.019 --> 22:36.432
You really don't know as much
as you think you do, rookie.

22:36.522 --> 22:39.014
I know what killing DeVoe
would do to you.

22:39.108 --> 22:41.225
You would be throwing away
everything you've done

22:41.318 --> 22:43.150
to become a better man,
to become a hero.

22:43.237 --> 22:44.478
You gotta realize that.

22:45.364 --> 22:46.480
You

22:47.074 --> 22:48.485
are a moron.

22:49.159 --> 22:51.742
- Ralph...
- I am not afraid of DeVoe

22:51.829 --> 22:53.286
or what he might do to me.

22:53.747 --> 22:55.989
I am afraid of what
he might do to you.

22:57.042 --> 22:59.955
And Iris and Caitlin and Cisco.

23:00.462 --> 23:02.294
Joe, Harry, Cecile.

23:03.382 --> 23:06.295
DeVoe has taken out
everyone who has gotten in his way.

23:06.510 --> 23:07.876
And Team Flash...

23:09.221 --> 23:11.679
They will always be in his way.

23:13.851 --> 23:15.968
This was never about
protecting yourself.

23:17.021 --> 23:19.434
I know that killing DeVoe
would mean throwing away

23:19.523 --> 23:21.230
everything I've done
to become a hero.

23:23.986 --> 23:25.193
But aside from my mom,

23:27.156 --> 23:29.944
this team is the only family
that I have ever had.

23:30.743 --> 23:32.700
And I would throw myself
into a furnace

23:32.786 --> 23:34.322
to keep them safe.

23:36.582 --> 23:38.289
DeVoe cannot have them.

23:39.084 --> 23:40.200
They are mine.

23:46.133 --> 23:47.840
What about what we want?

23:49.303 --> 23:52.011
You may not care about
losing who you've become,

23:52.097 --> 23:53.383
but we do.

23:54.475 --> 23:56.137
We like hero Ralph.

24:02.733 --> 24:04.395
Please don't take him away from us.

24:19.625 --> 24:23.164
Well, Ralph was misguided,

24:23.545 --> 24:25.286
but he had a half-good idea.

24:25.381 --> 24:27.839
- Which half?
- We use Edwin Gauss' powers

24:27.925 --> 24:29.757
to create a pocket dimension
to DeVoe's lair.

24:29.843 --> 24:31.755
Yeah, that's the half
I was afraid of.

24:31.845 --> 24:33.302
It doesn't get more
dangerous than this.

24:33.389 --> 24:35.972
So, if we go, everybody
needs to sign off.

24:36.058 --> 24:39.927
Look, you two have led this team
through every danger there is,

24:40.020 --> 24:42.057
so if you think this will stop
DeVoe from claiming

24:42.147 --> 24:43.763
any more lives, then...

24:44.191 --> 24:45.602
Let's go get that bastard.

24:46.026 --> 24:48.939
I mean, damn, Joe, you put it
all John McClane like that,

24:49.029 --> 24:50.110
of course, I'm in.

24:50.197 --> 24:52.029
- I'm in.
- I don't even need to ask

24:52.116 --> 24:54.199
Killer Frost how she votes,
we're in, too.

24:54.284 --> 24:55.445
So, it's settled.

24:57.663 --> 24:59.871
Tonight, we take on The Thinker.

25:05.170 --> 25:07.583
- Open it.
- You got it, mega-fast dude.

25:09.133 --> 25:10.874
Open it again in 15 minutes.

25:11.218 --> 25:12.629
If we don't come out with DeVoe
in cuffs,

25:12.720 --> 25:14.461
close it, don't open it again.

25:33.699 --> 25:34.815
It didn't work.

25:34.908 --> 25:36.069
Why would it?

25:36.452 --> 25:39.240
Sound has no effect on a hologram.

25:40.456 --> 25:42.197
If DeVoe's not here, then...

25:46.670 --> 25:48.161
Now, my love,

25:49.089 --> 25:51.376
the real battle begins.

26:06.523 --> 26:07.730
What's happening?

26:08.192 --> 26:09.854
Someone's taken over our systems.

26:10.027 --> 26:11.017
He sealed us in.

26:11.111 --> 26:13.068
The second pocket dimension
opened in S.T.A.R. Labs at the exact

26:13.155 --> 26:14.441
same time as ours.

26:15.699 --> 26:17.611
It's DeVoe, he used
that first opening

26:17.701 --> 26:18.737
to conceal his own entrance.

26:18.827 --> 26:20.409
That's why our sensors
didn't register.

26:20.496 --> 26:22.988
This is all a part of his plan,
the Samuroid attack,

26:23.082 --> 26:25.790
us getting Edwin, using him
to attack DeVoe's lair.

26:25.876 --> 26:27.458
- He wanted us divided.
- Where did Edwin go?

26:27.544 --> 26:29.206
He's back locked in his cell,
and we've got DeVoe's

26:29.296 --> 26:31.458
pocket dimension energy
coming from the Cortex.

26:31.548 --> 26:33.414
That must be where his chair is.
I mean, if we can get to it,

26:33.509 --> 26:34.499
we can use it to get our team back.

26:34.593 --> 26:36.129
First, we gotta get ourselves
out of here.

26:36.220 --> 26:37.586
Harry, can you unhack his code?

26:37.679 --> 26:39.591
Trying, but it's too complex.
If only I had my quantum

26:39.681 --> 26:41.263
encryption keys, I could do it,
but they're stuck in

26:41.350 --> 26:42.431
Cisco's workshop.

26:42.518 --> 26:43.850
But we're not stuck in here.

26:45.521 --> 26:47.934
- What are you gonna do?
- It's a little worst case scenario

26:48.023 --> 26:49.389
that I had Cisco whip up.

27:00.202 --> 27:01.613
Get back, get back.

27:02.079 --> 27:03.115
Harry.

27:03.205 --> 27:04.867
- Go, get your...
- I'm going to hack the computers.

27:04.957 --> 27:06.323
Yeah. Iris, get to that chair.

27:06.416 --> 27:07.657
- Dad, you can't...
- Go.

27:24.810 --> 27:26.597
I heard all the commotion
and I thought,

27:26.687 --> 27:28.223
"If DeVoe was here.

27:28.605 --> 27:29.937
"Where would he be going?"

27:30.274 --> 27:31.355
Hmm.

27:31.650 --> 27:34.688
A simple deduction for a simple man.

27:35.487 --> 27:38.605
Though I assure you,
you are no threat

27:38.699 --> 27:41.191
for an intellect of my magnitude.

27:41.451 --> 27:42.532
Please.

27:42.995 --> 27:44.952
Everyone I fight is smarter than me.

27:45.038 --> 27:46.995
No bad guy has beaten me yet.

27:47.082 --> 27:51.292
Well, I'm afraid an old friend
requests a re-match.

27:52.754 --> 27:54.086
I really hate sequels.

28:25.287 --> 28:26.823
Ah!

28:26.955 --> 28:28.366
Mrs. West-Allen.

28:28.707 --> 28:30.118
I was hoping we'd meet again.

28:35.380 --> 28:37.372
You might change your mind
about that pretty soon.

28:37.674 --> 28:38.835
Ah...

28:38.926 --> 28:41.885
There's that passion for
our chat in the courthouse.

28:41.970 --> 28:45.463
But I do remember warning you
that it could easily be destroyed.

28:46.892 --> 28:49.009
And I remember you asking me
what I was willing to do

28:49.102 --> 28:50.183
for my husband.

28:50.896 --> 28:52.182
How about I show you?

29:08.914 --> 29:10.200
Gideon.

29:10.290 --> 29:11.747
Yes, Dr. Wells?

29:11.833 --> 29:14.166
Increase the thinking cap's
dark matter feed.

29:17.506 --> 29:18.587
More.

29:18.674 --> 29:20.961
Warning, safe zone parameters
will be exceeded.

29:21.051 --> 29:23.543
- Recommend...
- Maximum capacity, now!

29:24.930 --> 29:26.046
Ah!

29:52.374 --> 29:53.535
Come on.

29:53.959 --> 29:56.702
A little closer. Little closer.

29:57.504 --> 30:00.918
Warning, fists in Pipeline
are larger than they appear.

30:23.071 --> 30:24.482
No.

30:43.884 --> 30:45.125
God!

30:47.512 --> 30:50.220
Even gray matter as un-evolved
as yours understands

30:50.307 --> 30:52.890
the pain of psychic attacks.

30:53.685 --> 30:56.553
You were born for me, Mr. Dibny.

30:56.646 --> 30:57.978
And now...

30:58.523 --> 31:00.139
You will die.

31:00.692 --> 31:01.933
For me.

31:02.152 --> 31:05.236
Yeah? You first!

31:08.367 --> 31:09.357
What's that?

31:14.873 --> 31:16.739
Big old fork to shove up your...

31:21.380 --> 31:23.872
One more strike and you're dead.

31:24.508 --> 31:26.875
I have been waiting
for this a long time,

31:26.968 --> 31:30.336
you and me alone
so I can make the hard choice

31:30.430 --> 31:31.966
that no one else will.

31:51.284 --> 31:53.526
Perhaps you are willing to do
what it takes.

31:55.247 --> 31:59.742
But it seems my love
is stronger than yours.

32:08.260 --> 32:09.922
Get out of my office.

32:13.682 --> 32:14.718
Where is he?

32:14.808 --> 32:16.015
- Iris.
- I'm okay.

32:16.101 --> 32:17.387
I'm okay, the others are
still out there

32:17.477 --> 32:18.763
fighting DeVoe and a Samuroid.

32:18.854 --> 32:20.390
Actually, now it's just DeVoe.

32:23.859 --> 32:25.145
- Iris.
- I'm okay,

32:25.235 --> 32:27.192
- we just need to get DeVoe.
- Breach us to him, I'm ready

32:27.279 --> 32:29.191
- to get blood on this jacket.
- The blowback in the lair

32:29.281 --> 32:30.692
knocked down my breaching.

32:30.782 --> 32:31.943
I'll find him.

32:38.707 --> 32:40.118
Did you just...

32:42.836 --> 32:46.295
Beat the Thinker? Yeah, I did.

32:46.798 --> 32:48.790
You just got out-thunk, punk.

32:49.968 --> 32:51.709
And I see you went
with the same plan as always.

32:51.803 --> 32:53.044
Yeah.

32:54.264 --> 32:56.176
Do you remember when
I visited you in prison?

32:56.683 --> 32:59.642
You said that I can have
a greater life if I just

32:59.728 --> 33:01.139
rise up?

33:02.189 --> 33:05.432
Well, I'm ready for that life.

33:06.526 --> 33:07.892
And for the first time,

33:08.320 --> 33:09.686
I might even deserve it.

33:10.739 --> 33:11.820
Yes.

33:12.657 --> 33:14.990
It appears I have been bested.

33:16.077 --> 33:19.866
However, a tip if I may.

33:21.291 --> 33:23.157
Before you cuff a meta,

33:23.960 --> 33:26.043
make sure the light
is the right color.

33:27.964 --> 33:29.045
Ralph!

33:36.348 --> 33:39.841
Ms. Petty never understood
the full magnitude of her powers.

33:39.935 --> 33:42.052
You're currently
the same gravimetric weight

33:42.145 --> 33:43.636
as a cement truck, Mr. Allen.

33:44.272 --> 33:47.356
That should hold you long enough
to bear witness.

33:49.653 --> 33:53.363
Ralph, just fight it, all right,
fight it. I'll save you.

33:57.118 --> 33:58.529
You already did, Barry.

33:58.995 --> 34:00.202
No.

34:03.583 --> 34:04.790
No!

34:07.128 --> 34:08.208
Ralph.

34:10.047 --> 34:11.289
Stay back.

34:45.417 --> 34:46.533
Melt.

35:00.599 --> 35:02.340
All the training.

35:02.434 --> 35:04.972
All the lessons you've taught
Mr. Dibny to help him

35:05.061 --> 35:06.768
reach his full potential.

35:07.188 --> 35:09.646
This body will be
the greatest gift of all.

35:10.609 --> 35:12.350
Thank you, Mr. Allen.

35:13.069 --> 35:15.402
You were an excellent teacher.

35:37.761 --> 35:39.468
We were supposed to save them.

35:41.848 --> 35:43.180
We tried.

35:44.225 --> 35:45.386
We failed.

35:49.272 --> 35:51.730
I know this isn't the ending
we were expecting,

35:51.816 --> 35:52.977
so...

35:53.902 --> 35:55.939
If anyone wants to talk.

36:02.535 --> 36:03.901
Should I track him down?

36:04.204 --> 36:05.536
No.

36:06.414 --> 36:08.155
I think I know where he is going.

36:19.594 --> 36:20.710
Cisco.

36:20.804 --> 36:23.592
Hey, uh, weather says rain's coming,
you mind helping me?

36:23.682 --> 36:26.220
Can you get Harry?
I think something's wrong with me.

36:32.065 --> 36:34.933
- All your vitals seem okay.
- Blood pressure,

36:35.026 --> 36:36.813
respiratory rate
seems normal as well.

36:36.903 --> 36:38.519
You're gonna have
to run the test again.

36:38.613 --> 36:41.651
There was some feeling,
I don't know what it was, but...

36:42.075 --> 36:43.407
You touched DeVoe.

36:44.327 --> 36:45.613
Hand me the dark matter scanner.

36:45.704 --> 36:46.990
The dark matter.

36:47.497 --> 36:48.704
I'll get it.

36:51.376 --> 36:53.242
- Focus, Harry.
- Gotta focus.

37:00.468 --> 37:03.131
There's no trace of dark matter
anywhere in your body.

37:03.430 --> 37:06.719
He must've used Melting Point's
powers to entangle your meta-DNA.

37:06.808 --> 37:09.676
- So, Killer Frost...
- Is gone?

37:41.134 --> 37:43.547
Thought I might find you
at the other office.

37:44.304 --> 37:45.465
Yeah, well...

37:45.722 --> 37:47.463
Without Ralph being around
to dodge rent,

37:47.557 --> 37:48.798
it's only a matter of time

37:48.975 --> 37:51.388
before the landlord
closes this place up.

37:51.895 --> 37:54.979
I know there are some things in here
Ralph wouldn't want anybody finding.

37:57.025 --> 37:59.608
You know, you could just
"whoosh" around

37:59.694 --> 38:01.526
and you could pack up a lot faster.

38:01.613 --> 38:02.899
Yeah, I know.

38:09.120 --> 38:10.577
Barry, look, I just wanna...

38:10.663 --> 38:12.370
Iris, I've...

38:14.292 --> 38:15.874
I know that you're...

38:16.586 --> 38:19.169
You're here for me
and that I can talk to you.

38:19.255 --> 38:21.121
And I love you for that, but...

38:23.468 --> 38:25.050
Right now, I just need to pack up.

38:26.471 --> 38:27.882
That's all.

38:31.392 --> 38:32.724
Okay, yeah.

38:36.397 --> 38:37.763
I'll leave you to it.

39:27.657 --> 39:29.148
I'll keep them safe.

40:11.784 --> 40:13.946
To our overwhelming success.

40:17.999 --> 40:19.080
Yes.

40:19.167 --> 40:20.999
In more ways than one.

40:21.252 --> 40:23.494
- What do you mean?
- Not only is my new host

40:23.588 --> 40:27.502
body immune to the ravages
of my ever-expanding mind,

40:32.513 --> 40:35.927
it also holds an ancillary benefit.

40:44.025 --> 40:46.483
Clifford!

40:51.115 --> 40:52.856
I'm nothing without you.

40:55.161 --> 40:59.826
And now all of me
is with you once more.

41:17.016 --> 41:20.350
But we must temper our celebration
with conviction.

41:22.313 --> 41:24.555
Our plans have yet
to reach their apex.

41:31.322 --> 41:32.904
- What is that?
- Dark matter,

41:33.449 --> 41:36.908
siphoned from the room where
Dr. Wells was charging

41:36.995 --> 41:38.486
his counterfeit cap.

41:38.997 --> 41:43.116
As I predicted,
his hubris was his undoing.

41:44.711 --> 41:49.877
And so now, the fire that burns down
Team Flash,

41:54.887 --> 41:57.504
will also light the path
to the enlightenment.
