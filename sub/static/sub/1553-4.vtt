02:16.379 --> 02:18.339
(Panting)

02:19.715 --> 02:22.051
(Gasping)

02:27.140 --> 02:28.807
(Hundred Eyes)
Stop struggling, fool.

02:30.393 --> 02:32.436
You were struck by
a five- step snake.

02:32.520 --> 02:34.772
His venom moves swiftly.

02:34.856 --> 02:38.442
Most die before their fifth step.

02:40.486 --> 02:41.905
Where is my sword?

02:41.988 --> 02:43.239
(Hundred Eyes)
Taken away.

02:43.322 --> 02:45.699
Punishment for breaking curfew.

02:45.783 --> 02:48.411
I need to go, Sifu.
Now.

02:49.370 --> 02:51.414
How do you revenge a snake?

02:52.248 --> 02:56.335
You would be a fool to think
only one serpent lays in wait.

02:56.419 --> 02:59.672
There is always
a deadlier strike to come.

02:59.755 --> 03:01.966
One should walk away.

03:02.050 --> 03:03.134
(Jingim)
Sifu.

03:04.718 --> 03:05.719
Master Polo.

03:08.639 --> 03:10.808
Save your breath.

03:11.767 --> 03:15.771
The Khan requests
that I inquire as to the Latin's health.

03:15.854 --> 03:17.731
Will he survive?

03:19.984 --> 03:22.320
Father will be most pleased.

03:22.403 --> 03:24.280
(Hundred Eyes)
And, um, the Prince?

03:26.824 --> 03:28.742
Without compassion,

03:28.826 --> 03:31.537
what is there
to distinguish men from beasts?

03:32.871 --> 03:35.041
What was your student
doing beyond the walls?

03:35.124 --> 03:36.792
(Marco)
Sleep escaped me.

03:36.875 --> 03:39.753
I thought a ride would clear my mind.

03:45.759 --> 03:48.596
So close to your throat...

03:49.847 --> 03:53.642
A few inches lower,
the venom would have stilled your heart.

03:53.726 --> 03:57.188
Tread carefully, Master Polo.

03:57.271 --> 04:00.774
Or you will find yourself
a more permanent sleep.

04:11.535 --> 04:13.454
(Kublai moaning)

04:39.897 --> 04:41.065
Great Khan.

04:42.025 --> 04:44.527
Business forces us
to disturb you.

04:48.947 --> 04:50.324
Escort the concubine out.

04:50.408 --> 04:52.535
Leave her to her task.

04:53.411 --> 04:54.828
(Moaning continues)

04:57.831 --> 05:01.210
Tell me, son,
what news of the Latin?

05:01.294 --> 05:04.255
Would you rather not hear
the news we carry of the Song rebels?

05:07.300 --> 05:10.261
I would have asked first if I had.

05:15.641 --> 05:19.937
The foreigner claims his mind was
muddied with thoughts that hindered sleep.

05:20.021 --> 05:22.981
He hoped a ride in the grasslands
might assist him.

05:23.066 --> 05:24.067
Oh.

05:24.900 --> 05:27.361
I wonder what disturbed him so.

05:27.445 --> 05:29.447
The healer promised
a full recovery.

05:29.530 --> 05:31.865
What news of the Song?

05:32.825 --> 05:34.202
They request a parley.

05:35.119 --> 05:36.745
To what end,
we do not know.

05:36.829 --> 05:40.040
(Jingim)
It seems an auspicious opportunity.

05:40.124 --> 05:41.542
They are afraid of war.

05:41.625 --> 05:42.793
An opportunity born of what, though?

05:42.876 --> 05:44.795
It makes little sense
with their current standing.

05:44.878 --> 05:46.422
But the parley will give us clarity.

05:47.715 --> 05:49.425
They request you personally, Sire.

05:49.508 --> 05:52.178
Perhaps a ruse to take your life.

05:52.261 --> 05:55.848
We must not be deceived.
Prepare to destroy them.

05:56.974 --> 05:59.602
They will make do with emissaries.

05:59.685 --> 06:02.062
The thought of a parley pleases me.

06:02.146 --> 06:04.273
Jingim's instincts are correct.

06:04.357 --> 06:06.275
Assemble the War Council.

06:15.075 --> 06:16.619
(Moaning contentedly)

06:24.835 --> 06:26.086
(Ling Ling laughing)

06:26.170 --> 06:28.297
(Jia Sidao) She has quite a way
with the boy, doesn't she?

06:28.381 --> 06:30.341
Caring. Kind.

06:30.424 --> 06:32.510
She is her mother's daughter.

06:34.387 --> 06:36.347
Will my mother
come back for me, Uncle?

06:36.430 --> 06:37.973
Of course.

06:38.056 --> 06:43.061
She is simply off learning
to be the best dancer in the world

06:43.146 --> 06:45.523
- so she can teach you one day.
- Mmm- hmm.

06:46.524 --> 06:48.317
Then I will be the best dancer

06:48.401 --> 06:49.485
- in the world.
- Mmm- hmm.

06:49.568 --> 06:51.445
'Tis odd...

06:51.529 --> 06:55.533
I've not seen Mei Lin since
the Emperor's spirit left his body.

06:55.616 --> 06:57.993
Where does your sister
keep herself now?

06:59.077 --> 07:00.913
Returned to her old ways, I suspect.

07:00.996 --> 07:03.582
Practicing her art in brothels.

07:03.666 --> 07:06.585
Mei Lin was cared for
and welcomed in her time here.

07:07.836 --> 07:10.005
What would drive her away?

07:10.088 --> 07:11.382
Treasure?

07:11.465 --> 07:13.842
You have enough to share, surely.

07:13.926 --> 07:15.803
I am not my sister's protector.

07:15.886 --> 07:17.012
(Empress Dowager)
Why?

07:17.095 --> 07:19.848
Was she not yours
in the days before your ascension?

07:19.932 --> 07:23.352
- That was a long time ago, Empress.
- (Ling Ling laughing)

07:27.898 --> 07:30.818
Would such a look have escaped
your face toward my husband?

07:31.944 --> 07:33.862
(Jia Sidao) I never knew
your husband to eat jonquils.

07:33.946 --> 07:36.615
If it suited him, he would have.

07:36.699 --> 07:39.410
And you would have worn
a more esteemed look.

07:39.493 --> 07:41.245
I am the Emperor!

07:41.329 --> 07:43.121
(Jia Sidao)
If my Emperor could eat flowers

07:43.206 --> 07:45.291
and keep the Mongols in check...

07:46.459 --> 07:48.877
I would gladly serve him a garden.

08:05.603 --> 08:06.729
(Marco)
Let me pass.

08:06.812 --> 08:08.063
(Guard)
What's your business, foreigner?

08:08.146 --> 08:09.273
(Marco)
Let me pass!

08:09.357 --> 08:11.442
- (Guard) What's your business...
- (Za Bing) Leave him.

08:15.946 --> 08:17.948
I need to speak with Kokachin.

08:19.116 --> 08:22.703
Delusion is an imperfection
that defiles the mind.

08:22.786 --> 08:24.663
I must speak with her, please.

08:32.337 --> 08:35.341
Is it the serpent's sting
that has deluded you?

08:35.424 --> 08:36.924
I intend no harm.

08:37.009 --> 08:38.385
(Scoffs)

08:38.469 --> 08:40.596
You are incapable of harm,
Master Marco.

08:40.679 --> 08:43.974
You need to be more vigilant
in your protection of Kokachin.

08:44.057 --> 08:45.183
She is in danger.

08:45.268 --> 08:47.811
Concern yourself
with the danger you face.

08:47.895 --> 08:51.023
The Blue Princess
is secure in my care.

08:51.106 --> 08:54.109
Leave now
or suffer my fate.

08:55.193 --> 08:56.404
(Sighs)

08:59.240 --> 09:00.241
(Relieved groan)

09:00.324 --> 09:02.200
(Za Bing urinating)

09:03.286 --> 09:06.414
Have you ever sampled
the third sex, Latin?

09:09.833 --> 09:11.835
(Urinating continues)

09:13.128 --> 09:14.129
(Sighs)

09:23.972 --> 09:27.560
Four winters ago, I took an arrow
in the back fighting the North Hordes.

09:27.643 --> 09:30.563
I tasted blood for two days.

09:30.646 --> 09:35.609
Great Khan bid me come and see him
when I was finally able to stand.

09:35.693 --> 09:38.821
And I'm his own flesh and blood.

09:45.619 --> 09:47.330
You were strong

09:47.413 --> 09:50.165
and quickly saddled
your own steed again.

09:51.542 --> 09:53.502
So brave.

10:04.888 --> 10:07.350
I heard word of a parley
with the Song rebels.

10:07.433 --> 10:10.227
- Is it true?
- It is.

10:10.311 --> 10:12.396
The War Council assembles.

10:12.480 --> 10:14.147
In your absence?

10:14.231 --> 10:15.899
We wait on Father.

10:15.983 --> 10:17.318
Where is he?

10:18.486 --> 10:21.989
Surely tending to
his round- eyed pet.

10:22.072 --> 10:25.409
Might you offer your Empress tea?
Or will you continue to stand idle?

10:25.493 --> 10:27.411
Forgive me, Empress.

10:39.047 --> 10:41.049
Spare the Europa no thought, Jingim.

10:42.009 --> 10:45.388
Do not let your father
doubt you the better man.

10:45.471 --> 10:47.598
I am the better man.

10:47.681 --> 10:52.144
The better man does not sit in the dark
with his woman and his jealousies.

10:52.227 --> 10:55.981
The better man stands erect and strong

10:56.064 --> 10:59.818
and finds a way
to tilt the scales in his favor.

11:05.282 --> 11:07.451
- (Horse whinnying)
- (Sube) Easy, girl.

11:13.916 --> 11:14.917
Sube.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.711
A message for my brother.

11:18.754 --> 11:20.130
It's urgent.

11:20.213 --> 11:23.426
Follow our arrangement
and make fast your horse.

11:24.510 --> 11:25.594
Yes, ma'am.

11:26.762 --> 11:29.473
(Ahmad) Sidao beheaded
our men not weeks ago.

11:29.557 --> 11:31.141
Why call for peace now?

11:31.224 --> 11:33.936
(Jingim) He fears the wrath
that comes and seeks to alter course.

11:34.019 --> 11:37.565
The man is not circumspect.
Jia Sidao is too arrogant for that.

11:37.648 --> 11:39.525
(Yusuf)
His ambition is his arrogance.

11:39.608 --> 11:43.696
But the Chancellor is not the only
mind at work within the Walled City.

11:43.779 --> 11:45.989
You see a different landscape, Yusuf?

11:46.073 --> 11:48.784
Have your spies received
intelligence from Xiangyang?

11:48.867 --> 11:51.537
No, Sire.
I rely now on my own.

11:51.620 --> 11:54.414
The Boy Emperor
is but five seasons old.

11:54.498 --> 11:56.792
His coronation day approaches.

11:56.875 --> 12:00.420
Sidao may play the royal,
but he's a pretender to the throne.

12:00.504 --> 12:04.550
He desires power, but holds
no royal position or blood claim.

12:04.633 --> 12:06.927
There are other ways to secure power,
Prince Jingim.

12:07.010 --> 12:11.264
Are we safe to assume
Jia Sidao takes such steps presently?

12:11.348 --> 12:12.516
(Jingim)
Yes.

12:12.600 --> 12:14.685
A divided empire
is an opportunity.

12:14.768 --> 12:17.605
One that must be seized upon
with ruthless force.

12:17.688 --> 12:20.190
One that can be
molded to serve us.

12:20.273 --> 12:22.359
(Kublai)
Sidao is a peasant...

12:22.442 --> 12:24.528
Empress a grieving widow.

12:24.612 --> 12:28.323
A grieving widow
loyal to the memory of her husband.

12:29.950 --> 12:32.452
The dead Emperor
was always a reluctant warrior.

12:32.536 --> 12:33.579
(Grunts)

12:41.294 --> 12:43.463
Which hand offers the parley?

12:45.549 --> 12:46.967
Either way,

12:47.050 --> 12:49.386
it is better to
know what we face...

12:49.469 --> 12:51.680
and win the war
with this knowledge

12:51.764 --> 12:54.057
before we consider the battlefield.

12:59.312 --> 13:00.480
We parley.

13:00.564 --> 13:02.983
See what the table presents us.

13:03.526 --> 13:06.403
Perhaps there will be
a dung- stuffed head of a five- year- old.

13:06.486 --> 13:08.947
Then we will have our answer.

13:09.031 --> 13:10.198
Ahmad...

13:12.075 --> 13:14.912
you will lead the parley
with the Song ambassadors.

13:14.995 --> 13:16.454
Depart at dawn.

13:17.540 --> 13:18.582
Sire...

13:20.000 --> 13:23.921
might I recommend
sending Prince Jingim...

13:24.838 --> 13:28.508
so the parley has some
semblance of royal command?

13:32.179 --> 13:33.722
Prince Jingim will
oversee the conference.

13:36.850 --> 13:38.310
You honor me
with this task.

13:41.980 --> 13:42.981
(Grunts)

13:53.325 --> 13:56.494
Heal the battle wounds
of Wuchang, Jingim...

13:56.579 --> 13:58.664
as a diplomat making peace.

14:09.216 --> 14:10.508
(Marco grunts)

14:12.010 --> 14:14.429
Never volunteer
for a stealth mission.

14:14.512 --> 14:17.057
You might as well
have a barking dog accompany you.

14:17.140 --> 14:19.852
- I need my sword.
- Are all Latins as dense as you?

14:24.189 --> 14:26.149
I would give you a sword...

14:26.233 --> 14:28.235
but I'm afraid whose body
the blade would find

14:28.318 --> 14:30.153
when the rumors reach you.

14:31.321 --> 14:33.616
Your father has returned.

14:36.994 --> 14:38.621
(Ostrich honking)

14:43.626 --> 14:44.918
(NiccolÃ²)
Great Khan,

14:45.002 --> 14:49.381
a rare and exotic gift
from the Arabian Peninsula

14:49.464 --> 14:51.258
by route of Dunhuang.

14:51.341 --> 14:53.886
(Kublai)
Animal smells of shit.

14:56.597 --> 14:59.892
It has been aboard our caravan
for weeks, Great Khan.

14:59.975 --> 15:01.018
Rise.

15:01.101 --> 15:04.521
A caravan we humbly
take through your kingdom.

15:04.605 --> 15:08.108
A kindness we wish to continue,
if your wisdom should allow us.

15:08.191 --> 15:11.444
Prosperous business
is always welcome.

15:11.528 --> 15:14.657
We gladly gave tribute,
Lord Khan.

15:16.825 --> 15:19.036
You shall be allowed
to continue your trade.

15:19.119 --> 15:21.622
My realm is yours.

15:29.046 --> 15:32.007
Do you have
any interest in your son?

15:33.676 --> 15:35.886
Yes, Sire.
I am anxious to embrace him.

15:35.969 --> 15:37.971
It has been too long.

15:38.055 --> 15:41.558
Then turn, merchant, and behold.

16:13.631 --> 16:15.092
You look like an Oriental.

16:15.175 --> 16:18.011
(NiccolÃ²)
One must adapt to survive, brother.

16:18.095 --> 16:19.304
And Marco has.

16:19.387 --> 16:21.849
One can adapt
without forsaking his heritage...

16:23.100 --> 16:24.351
his father's heritage.

16:24.434 --> 16:26.186
My father forsook his son.

16:26.269 --> 16:28.897
- I understand your...
- You understand nothing!

16:30.565 --> 16:32.776
I am sorry I had to leave you,

16:32.860 --> 16:34.277
but it is more dangerous
on the Silk Road...

16:34.361 --> 16:36.238
Why did you return?

16:37.280 --> 16:41.201
To bank profits, pay tribute,
mostly to see my boy.

16:41.284 --> 16:43.370
Is that not enough?

16:43.453 --> 16:45.538
It is enough.

16:45.622 --> 16:46.790
It's not believable.

16:46.874 --> 16:49.251
There are reasons
why we left you.

16:51.795 --> 16:54.089
Reasons we must again
return to the Silk Road.

16:54.172 --> 16:55.758
- Commerce.
- No.

16:56.717 --> 16:58.969
You must trust me when I say

16:59.052 --> 17:04.432
all efforts that I make are for
our home... our Lord and for you.

17:06.393 --> 17:08.060
I need your help.

17:08.145 --> 17:09.561
Say it and it is done.

17:09.646 --> 17:10.814
Give me your blade.

17:10.897 --> 17:12.565
(NiccolÃ²)
For what purpose?

17:12.648 --> 17:15.152
This was not an accident.

17:15.234 --> 17:17.279
- What trouble have you got into?
- It is no concern of yours.

17:17.362 --> 17:19.990
What requires a sword, Marco?

17:20.907 --> 17:23.367
Someone is in danger.

17:23.451 --> 17:25.619
- Someone?
- A friend.

17:25.703 --> 17:27.830
A woman?

17:30.542 --> 17:32.252
Marco, listen to me.

17:32.335 --> 17:36.214
Despite your dress and visage,
you are not one of them.

17:36.298 --> 17:38.091
You never will be.

17:38.175 --> 17:40.427
You get involved with them,
you damage us.

17:40.510 --> 17:42.720
You damage the family business.

17:48.060 --> 17:49.436
I thought he would never go.

17:52.272 --> 17:54.107
One day, he will understand.

18:42.364 --> 18:44.157
Your chest is puffed.

18:45.408 --> 18:46.534
In this place,

18:46.618 --> 18:48.912
that's what whores do
when they want to get fucked.

18:48.996 --> 18:52.958
The horseman with the shaved head,
where is he?

18:53.041 --> 18:54.792
That's half of Cambulac.

18:54.877 --> 18:59.006
This one deals in jewels
he could not rightfully own.

18:59.089 --> 19:01.216
That's the other half of Cambulac.

19:02.592 --> 19:03.844
Now, piss off.

19:03.927 --> 19:05.888
You know who I speak of.

19:07.764 --> 19:10.058
Tell me where I can find him.

19:19.776 --> 19:23.030
Did you enter
my tea house unarmed?

19:26.741 --> 19:27.784
Answer me!

19:27.868 --> 19:28.869
(Grunting)

19:39.296 --> 19:40.297
(Gasping)

19:45.468 --> 19:46.511
(Groans)

19:50.682 --> 19:51.849
Tell me where!

19:52.850 --> 19:55.270
The south end.

19:55.353 --> 19:58.106
The shanty by the ironworks.

19:58.190 --> 20:01.068
If you're lying,
I will come back.

20:02.069 --> 20:03.570
Please do.
(Grunts)

20:06.281 --> 20:07.699
(Altan gasping)

21:15.850 --> 21:17.644
(Faint scratching sound)

21:33.410 --> 21:35.620
(Scratching continues)

21:52.054 --> 21:55.057
(Scratching continues)

22:33.428 --> 22:34.887
(Grunting)

22:36.098 --> 22:37.724
Why do you threaten Kokachin?

22:37.807 --> 22:38.891
(Grunts)

22:40.435 --> 22:43.688
I saw you on the grasslands.
I saw you take the jewels.

22:43.771 --> 22:46.149
What concern is it of yours?

22:47.609 --> 22:48.610
(Grunts)

22:49.611 --> 22:52.989
I threatened Kokachin with nothing!
You pursued me.

22:53.072 --> 22:56.284
I thought you the danger.
I would lay down my life for her.

22:56.951 --> 22:58.828
(Men shouting)

23:01.414 --> 23:03.791
(Marco)
What are you doing? No!

23:05.127 --> 23:08.546
Let me go!
Let me go! Now!

23:08.630 --> 23:10.006
- Let me go!
- (Guard) No!

23:11.258 --> 23:13.135
(Marco)
You're making a mistake.

23:22.227 --> 23:25.522
Tell Vice Regent Yusuf where I am.
He will tell you.

23:26.731 --> 23:28.441
It's on his orders.

23:30.777 --> 23:31.778
(Cell locks)

23:37.367 --> 23:38.910
You did this.

23:40.036 --> 23:41.246
No.

23:42.872 --> 23:44.874
Those savages did this,

23:44.957 --> 23:46.334
though we did nothing.

23:46.418 --> 23:48.211
Those dogs you live with,

23:48.295 --> 23:51.173
they don't know
how to treat men of God.

23:51.256 --> 23:52.632
- We were...
- (NiccolÃ²) Smuggling.

23:54.634 --> 23:56.178
We were smuggling.

23:58.180 --> 24:00.807
There is no point
lying to the boy.

24:09.982 --> 24:11.943
Do you know
what they do for that?

24:16.781 --> 24:18.908
Why am I here?

24:20.743 --> 24:23.330
We had to store
the goods somewhere.

24:23.413 --> 24:24.539
The coin, son.

24:25.623 --> 24:27.917
You left me
in this foreign land...

24:30.462 --> 24:32.505
and now you have destroyed me.

24:34.424 --> 24:36.759
Do you not see that?

24:40.930 --> 24:42.557
You're a coward.

24:58.740 --> 24:59.949
All my life

25:00.032 --> 25:05.162
I have waited for the great adventurer
to offer me a place at his side.

25:08.916 --> 25:11.419
I finally got what I wanted.

26:11.187 --> 26:12.605
Sidao is not here?

26:12.689 --> 26:15.567
With regret, no.

26:15.650 --> 26:19.446
Surely, the same regret
the Great Khan offers

26:19.529 --> 26:21.072
for not attending.

26:22.615 --> 26:26.619
I am his son and heir
and I speak with full authority.

26:26.703 --> 26:30.998
And I, Prince,
speak with authority from the Walled City.

26:31.082 --> 26:32.792
And from whose authority
does that flow?

26:32.875 --> 26:35.962
The child, the old woman,
or the pretender?

26:37.380 --> 26:41.008
I speak on behalf of
all the Song dynasty.

26:41.092 --> 26:42.510
(Ahmad)
You mean all that remains

26:42.594 --> 26:44.971
by a shred of silk
down by the Han River.

26:45.054 --> 26:47.974
We take your request
for parley with seriousness.

26:48.057 --> 26:50.059
As a gesture of such,

26:50.142 --> 26:54.772
the Great Khan releases
our prisoners of war from Wuchang to you.

26:54.856 --> 26:57.692
Your gesture is greatly appreciated.

26:57.775 --> 26:59.026
So was yours.

26:59.110 --> 27:01.946
Though returning our prisoners
without their bodies

27:02.029 --> 27:04.240
was an interesting prelude for peace.

27:04.323 --> 27:07.952
A regrettable circumstance of war

27:08.035 --> 27:10.497
and one we wish not to repeat.

27:10.580 --> 27:11.873
We are in agreement.

27:11.956 --> 27:15.167
And my father's minister will capitulate.

27:15.251 --> 27:17.294
Of course.

27:17.379 --> 27:20.632
Provided suitable terms
and tribute payments are offered.

27:22.299 --> 27:23.385
We are prepared to offer...

27:23.468 --> 27:26.262
Five hundred thousand
taels of silver.

27:26.345 --> 27:28.848
Five hundred thousand
bolts of silk.

27:28.931 --> 27:32.184
And three of every
five grains of rice you sow...

27:32.268 --> 27:33.561
for 10 years.

27:34.937 --> 27:38.858
This is beyond reason.
We called for this parley in good faith.

27:38.941 --> 27:41.486
You called for this parley in fear.

27:42.153 --> 27:45.239
If you do not wish to
engage in honorable terms,

27:45.322 --> 27:47.074
- we will return to...
- (Jingim) Ambassador,

27:47.158 --> 27:48.743
this rate is unwarranted.

27:49.786 --> 27:51.871
We will find a suitable figure.

27:51.954 --> 27:56.042
And Minister Ahmad will wait
with the convoy by the horses.

28:13.142 --> 28:18.189
The Great Kublai Khan
is interested in peace with South China.

28:18.272 --> 28:22.652
All he demands is that your leaders
surrender the Song dynasty to history.

28:22.735 --> 28:27.699
Become unified with the North
in a new dynasty under a new emperor.

28:28.450 --> 28:31.786
This message
is a burden of royalty.

28:33.287 --> 28:36.248
One better suited to myself
than the Minister.

28:36.332 --> 28:41.921
Your respect for Chinese ways and culture
is known to us, Prince.

29:20.084 --> 29:21.961
We are still new to
the ways of your kingdom.

29:25.923 --> 29:28.718
Value is the first thing you seek.

29:29.677 --> 29:31.012
Risk, the second.

29:32.639 --> 29:34.474
The silk worm is sacred,

29:34.557 --> 29:37.644
more valuable
than gems and gold, Master Polo.

29:37.727 --> 29:41.773
Its theft is punishable by death.

29:41.856 --> 29:45.693
Please... we did not know...

29:45.777 --> 29:47.153
Enough.

30:02.877 --> 30:04.587
What is their origin?

30:04.671 --> 30:06.338
They were not procured by us.

30:09.091 --> 30:11.928
A man in our caravan
acquired them.

30:17.892 --> 30:19.435
Where is this man now?

30:19.519 --> 30:22.104
He did not survive the journey,
Lord Khan.

30:29.904 --> 30:32.156
And I'm quite confident
neither shall you.

31:14.531 --> 31:18.578
A dispatch has arrived, Chancellor.
From your sister.

32:00.369 --> 32:02.705
I've just received word that
the great and noble Kublai Khan

32:02.789 --> 32:05.457
will not be attending
my peace parley.

32:06.626 --> 32:09.295
What parley?

32:10.462 --> 32:12.589
What have you done?

32:14.341 --> 32:16.719
You no longer hold a place
in the Royal Court.

32:18.763 --> 32:20.222
Old woman,

32:20.306 --> 32:23.768
you have no authority
to dictate or declare my place.

32:25.352 --> 32:29.565
My ambassadors were instructed to secure
an accord with the Mongols at all costs.

32:29.649 --> 32:32.109
When they return,
I will have every authority

32:32.193 --> 32:34.486
and you will find yourself
a lonely warmonger.

32:35.612 --> 32:38.574
Your currency is the fear of war.

32:38.658 --> 32:41.368
But it is spent
and you are nothing without it.

32:42.286 --> 32:45.790
The Song shall not share rice
with that bloated Mongolian cur.

32:45.873 --> 32:49.168
The Council will
embrace peace if offered.

32:50.336 --> 32:54.506
The people of South China
will do their Lord's bidding.

32:54.590 --> 32:56.592
And so will you.

33:12.566 --> 33:14.861
(Chains rattling)

33:34.046 --> 33:35.256
Unchain him.

33:44.056 --> 33:45.599
Leave us.

33:57.987 --> 33:59.696
Tell me of your father.

34:09.916 --> 34:11.458
He...

34:14.210 --> 34:16.297
He is a well- regarded trader.

34:18.507 --> 34:20.885
His shipping contacts
have remained loyal through the years.

34:20.967 --> 34:24.554
I ask of character
and you tell me of his profession.

34:24.638 --> 34:29.101
Do you have any of your colorful language
that speaks to the man or not?

34:30.476 --> 34:33.480
It would be artful color, My Lord.

34:35.524 --> 34:37.400
A mirage.

34:42.697 --> 34:46.159
(Kublai) I grew hearing tales
of the Great Genghis.

34:47.786 --> 34:49.621
I knew him only as a small boy,

34:49.705 --> 34:53.583
but the man my eyes saw
was not big enough.

34:55.043 --> 34:57.839
Genghis of my mind...

34:57.922 --> 35:00.507
he was a giant.

35:01.884 --> 35:04.595
Our imaginations outrun us, Sire.

35:09.683 --> 35:12.812
When you made your way to Cambulac
and your father left you to me,

35:12.895 --> 35:15.481
you had gone no further east,
had you?

35:16.983 --> 35:18.109
No.

35:20.736 --> 35:22.864
These silkworms...

35:24.490 --> 35:26.783
they are native
to the Jiangxi province.

35:26.868 --> 35:30.371
A region you have never visited.

35:30.454 --> 35:33.457
But your father and uncle
have since traveled there.

35:37.628 --> 35:41.423
It's the cocoon
that gives the silk.

35:43.050 --> 35:45.887
Comes out like sweet milk, then hardens.

35:48.139 --> 35:51.350
Ugly worm turns
into an ugly moth, but...

35:52.809 --> 35:54.520
leaves such treasure behind.

35:55.938 --> 35:59.650
Then some child somewhere
crushes the moth, but...

36:01.027 --> 36:03.154
the silk is still mine.

36:04.947 --> 36:06.282
The worm...

36:08.534 --> 36:10.244
the silk...

36:10.327 --> 36:12.496
the child...

36:13.747 --> 36:15.041
All mine.

36:21.547 --> 36:24.841
You will be spared.

36:27.303 --> 36:29.972
Your father and uncle
will be sentenced.

36:31.015 --> 36:34.185
Artful color will not
alter their character.

36:35.102 --> 36:37.688
What is their punishment?

36:39.148 --> 36:41.733
It is on this that I dwell.

37:07.426 --> 37:08.844
(Knock on door)

37:10.012 --> 37:11.222
(Knocking continues)

37:27.821 --> 37:29.906
You've been fighting.

37:29.991 --> 37:32.784
A spy, he tracked me.

37:34.536 --> 37:36.288
Who was it?

37:36.372 --> 37:38.290
A foreigner.
A round eye.

37:39.875 --> 37:41.002
He is no threat.

37:41.085 --> 37:42.794
The Imperial Guard arrested him.

37:42.878 --> 37:44.505
You did not need
to set the snake.

37:48.217 --> 37:49.801
If the Guard have him...

37:49.885 --> 37:51.220
He knows nothing.

37:51.303 --> 37:53.222
He thought I was trying to hurt you,

37:53.305 --> 37:55.349
to steal from you.

38:00.271 --> 38:02.148
And he tried to defend me.

38:02.231 --> 38:03.357
Why would he do that?

38:05.026 --> 38:07.153
I do not know.

38:07.236 --> 38:11.198
But I know your mind.
I turn my heart to no other.

38:12.616 --> 38:15.869
The gems have traded well.
We should go.

38:15.952 --> 38:17.288
Patience.

38:17.371 --> 38:19.165
War is coming.

38:19.248 --> 38:22.251
We will find cover
for our escape within it.

38:38.309 --> 38:40.644
The Song have agreed
to cease their raids in the west

38:40.727 --> 38:42.646
and pay tribute to you, Father.

38:43.980 --> 38:46.400
Peace without bloodshed
is upon us.

38:46.483 --> 38:49.195
Was there a sense of where
the parley offer came from?

38:49.278 --> 38:50.987
Who is the administering hand?

38:51.072 --> 38:53.990
(Jingim) To this end,
the Minister was wise to inquire.

38:54.075 --> 38:56.368
They artfully evaded a direct answer.

38:56.452 --> 38:59.580
But it would be safe
to assume the Walled City is caught

38:59.663 --> 39:02.374
amidst a power struggle
between the Chancellor Jia Sidao

39:02.458 --> 39:03.834
and the Empress Dowager.

39:05.001 --> 39:07.754
Let the yellow birds
battle over their defeat

39:07.838 --> 39:12.301
while we celebrate
the well- crafted victory of Prince Jingim.

39:12.384 --> 39:13.802
- Yes.
- (Court murmurs in agreement)

39:18.515 --> 39:20.392
(Chabi)
Such an ugly little creature.

39:20.476 --> 39:22.894
(Kublai)
Yet men will kill for it.

39:24.146 --> 39:26.190
Risk my wrath.

39:26.273 --> 39:27.774
Betray their blood.

39:28.859 --> 39:30.652
Because to them...

39:32.279 --> 39:35.532
it is fortune, not legacy,
that changes a life.

39:44.375 --> 39:45.876
(Growls softly)

39:47.294 --> 39:48.920
Come to me.

39:51.798 --> 39:53.049
(Clears throat)

39:55.469 --> 39:56.470
(Grunts)

40:06.605 --> 40:08.607
What is wrong?

40:08.690 --> 40:10.484
I'm simply surprised.

40:11.777 --> 40:13.154
By?

40:14.405 --> 40:17.824
Your attention these days
seems to be occupied with...

40:17.908 --> 40:19.535
Chinese matters.

40:20.744 --> 40:21.745
Ah.

40:22.704 --> 40:23.747
Yes.

40:24.998 --> 40:27.876
These Chinese, they...

40:27.959 --> 40:29.920
require careful attention.

40:31.172 --> 40:34.258
Well, I should...
have to watch her close.

40:37.594 --> 40:41.056
Not something the Great Khan
should be troubled with.

40:43.559 --> 40:46.102
Let me find you
someone more exotic.

40:47.729 --> 40:49.940
An Indian.

40:50.023 --> 40:51.858
A Zanzibari.

40:51.942 --> 40:54.445
Perhaps, a Slav.

40:54.528 --> 40:56.238
It's her...

40:56.322 --> 41:01.827
Her prowess is evident,
yet simply not harnessed in the...

41:01.910 --> 41:03.287
proper manner.

41:04.621 --> 41:08.292
Something that should be
remedied with much practice.

41:13.839 --> 41:18.051
You worry without cause,
my lovely, favorite wife.

41:19.428 --> 41:22.431
You have a place
above all others.

41:23.724 --> 41:25.058
Ceremonially.

41:26.435 --> 41:27.936
Chabi...

41:29.521 --> 41:31.022
you have my devotion.

41:47.456 --> 41:51.543
It is time to honor
Jingim's Mongol triumph over the Chinese.

42:19.112 --> 42:21.782
Your mother sent a message today.

42:21.865 --> 42:25.244
An important message
that arrived too late.

42:25.327 --> 42:26.703
It cost me greatly.

42:28.330 --> 42:30.707
But luck was with me.

42:30.791 --> 42:33.335
I turned your mother's failure
to my favor.

42:34.545 --> 42:38.006
Still, mistakes demand correction.

42:40.342 --> 42:43.345
I have a tale to tell you
before sleep.

42:45.306 --> 42:47.391
(Theater music playing)

42:49.810 --> 42:50.977
(Kublai chuckling)

42:52.313 --> 42:55.899
It's the Cricket Minister.
(Laughing) It's the Cricket Minister.

42:55.982 --> 42:59.778
Look how they leap. (Laughing)
Look how they leap.

42:59.861 --> 43:02.864
(Man singing in Cantonese)

43:04.325 --> 43:07.869
(Singing continues)

43:09.788 --> 43:10.789
(Court laughing)

43:14.626 --> 43:17.296
A victorious son!

43:17.379 --> 43:18.589
(Kublai chuckling)

43:21.342 --> 43:22.801
(Kublai)
Ahmad!

43:30.266 --> 43:31.852
(Jia Sidao)
Long ago...

43:31.935 --> 43:35.314
the consort Yao Niang
was the favorite of Emperor Li Yu.

43:35.397 --> 43:38.567
She was a dancer, like you.

43:39.818 --> 43:41.027
Emperor Yu believed

43:41.111 --> 43:44.948
that a woman's feet were
the very essence of feminine beauty.

43:45.907 --> 43:48.118
This is why
he liked Yao Niang.

43:48.201 --> 43:52.498
Her feet were small,
delicate, perfect.

43:53.707 --> 43:56.793
Women with such feet
became coveted.

43:56.877 --> 44:00.756
Measures had to be taken
to keep their feet the perfect size.

44:00.839 --> 44:02.508
Three inches long.

44:02.591 --> 44:03.592
(Giggles)

44:06.637 --> 44:09.305
They had to be bound.

44:12.476 --> 44:15.145
That is not
how that happened.

44:15.228 --> 44:18.565
I congratulate you, brother,
on a fine accord.

44:18.649 --> 44:22.193
You are now proven
in battle and politics.

44:22.277 --> 44:24.029
Warrior and diplomat.

44:24.112 --> 44:26.072
(Man singing in Cantonese)

44:30.577 --> 44:34.289
And I beg forgiveness if I,
at all, overstepped at the parley.

44:34.373 --> 44:36.082
It was your hour, not mine.

44:36.166 --> 44:37.876
Your aggression weakened the Song.

44:39.085 --> 44:40.962
Wolf and crow, Ahmad.

44:41.046 --> 44:43.048
I am just a bookkeeper.

44:43.131 --> 44:46.342
I tally, I account, I serve.

44:46.427 --> 44:47.719
It was our day.

44:47.803 --> 44:49.721
Were we born of the same mother,

44:49.805 --> 44:52.265
we could not have worked
together better as brothers.

45:17.833 --> 45:19.125
(Jia Sidao)
A piece of linen...

45:19.209 --> 45:24.005
is wrapped
over the four small toes...

45:26.424 --> 45:29.094
pulled under the instep

45:29.177 --> 45:31.012
and behind the heel.

45:49.114 --> 45:50.824
Come.

45:56.246 --> 45:57.873
(Jia Sidao)
Now, this linen...

45:57.956 --> 46:01.835
is tightened daily
until the toes break,

46:01.918 --> 46:04.337
fold under the foot

46:04.420 --> 46:07.090
and flatten themselves
against the sole.

46:19.102 --> 46:23.356
The heel becomes slender over time.

46:23.439 --> 46:25.316
And finally...

46:25.400 --> 46:28.319
the heel shifts forward
to the ball of the foot,

46:28.403 --> 46:31.615
breaking the arch
and forcing it upward.

46:49.382 --> 46:50.634
My Lady.

47:00.977 --> 47:03.396
The Khan is dissatisfied.

47:03.479 --> 47:06.191
I am pained
to hear such news.

47:06.274 --> 47:08.735
As well you should be.

47:11.362 --> 47:12.447
Show me.

47:13.448 --> 47:14.783
Empress?

47:14.866 --> 47:17.285
Show me how you move.

47:19.245 --> 47:21.915
I will remedy your flaws.

47:42.185 --> 47:45.355
Do you think you would like to be
one of these hallowed women?

47:46.773 --> 47:48.692
Like the beautiful dancer Yao Niang?

47:48.775 --> 47:50.611
Chancellor?

47:52.738 --> 47:53.905
Yes?

48:05.626 --> 48:08.629
Your mother should have
started this years ago.

48:10.631 --> 48:13.341
She causes you this pain.

48:15.719 --> 48:17.137
(Bones cracking)
(Screaming)

48:18.596 --> 48:20.098
Be still, my Sunflower.

48:22.142 --> 48:23.727
- Be still.
- (Screaming continues)

48:27.147 --> 48:28.314
(Horses whinnying)
(Men shouting)

48:47.458 --> 48:49.044
(Man)
We are your ambassadors.

48:49.795 --> 48:52.380
Please! Mercy!
We are Song!

48:53.131 --> 48:54.299
(Groans)

48:55.508 --> 48:56.843
(Speaking Cantonese)

48:59.971 --> 49:01.347
(Kublai laughing)

49:01.431 --> 49:02.974
(Man laughing)

49:23.453 --> 49:27.248
I expect that sacrifice was a ruse
the Great Khan had intended.

49:27.332 --> 49:28.333
Hmm.

49:33.129 --> 49:35.048
Do you worry for your father?

49:39.510 --> 49:42.013
My father brought
his plight upon himself.

49:43.473 --> 49:45.350
I know this.

49:45.433 --> 49:47.102
It keeps sleep at bay, hmm?

49:49.604 --> 49:52.774
A persistent affliction
since I was a boy.

49:54.275 --> 49:56.737
And is it this affliction
that sees you roaming

49:56.820 --> 49:59.489
at night on horseback?

50:00.907 --> 50:06.037
The canals called to me at home.
Here, the grasslands.

50:08.164 --> 50:10.291
(Kublai)
It is a demon like no other.

50:12.043 --> 50:15.380
One who sleeps
wherever he lays his head

50:15.463 --> 50:17.841
can never understand the beast.

50:17.924 --> 50:20.010
You, too, My Lord?

50:22.137 --> 50:26.307
The distractions of rule
occupy my mind when I should sleep.

50:26.391 --> 50:30.645
You are a thinker, Latin,
as am I.

50:32.647 --> 50:34.732
This is good.

50:54.335 --> 50:57.213
Amends must be made
for your father's crime.

50:58.714 --> 50:59.757
(Sighs)

50:59.841 --> 51:01.802
I understand.

51:02.718 --> 51:04.595
You will decide his fate.

51:06.764 --> 51:08.599
My Lord?

51:08.683 --> 51:11.061
Left to my vice regent, Yusuf,
or myself,

51:11.144 --> 51:13.354
your father's punishment
would be certain.

51:14.480 --> 51:16.732
His thief heart would now be still.

51:17.943 --> 51:20.695
I know the pain this will cause you.

51:20.778 --> 51:23.406
I know compassion.

51:23.489 --> 51:24.825
And you know our laws...

51:26.159 --> 51:27.994
our customs.

51:28.912 --> 51:30.872
You will choose
your father's punishment.

51:31.998 --> 51:35.335
And then you shall find sleep.
