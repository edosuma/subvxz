00:01.168 --> 00:03.785
Previously on "Designated Survivor”...

00:03.921 --> 00:06.128
[Ritter] Capitol's been attacked.
Eagle is gone.

00:06.256 --> 00:08.634
Congress, the Cabinet.
You are now the President.

00:08.759 --> 00:09.794
My name is Seth Wright.

00:09.927 --> 00:12.134
| was named White House
Press Secretary.

00:12.262 --> 00:14.754
Aaron, I want you here.
| won't take "no" for an answer.

00:14.890 --> 00:16.972
| serve at the pleasure
of the President.

00:17.100 --> 00:19.091
-Welcome back.
-Thank you, sir.

00:19.228 --> 00:21.970
| would like you to be my chief of staff.
I'm throwing you in the deep end.

00:22.105 --> 00:23.061
| won't let you down.

00:23.190 --> 00:25.272
Agent Wells,
| hereby authorize you

00:25.400 --> 00:26.856
to use whatever means necessary,

00:26.985 --> 00:28.851
to find the people
involved in this conspiracy

00:28.987 --> 00:30.443
and bring them to justice.

00:30.572 --> 00:32.028
[Hannah] Our target is Patrick Lloyd.

00:32.156 --> 00:35.149
We believe that he is responsible
for the bombing on our Capitol.

00:35.285 --> 00:36.275
What's going on?

00:36.411 --> 00:37.446
Patrick Lloyd.

00:37.579 --> 00:40.037
He hacked the Defense Department's
most highly classified server.

00:40.165 --> 00:42.543
Troop movements,
intel on our nuclear arsenal.

00:42.668 --> 00:44.955
Lloyd could sell off the information
in pieces to the highest bidder.

00:45.087 --> 00:47.954
-Are we any closer to finding him?
-No, sir.

00:49.424 --> 00:53.418
[majestic music]

01:16.952 --> 01:19.660
They broke ground here in 1793.

01:21.999 --> 01:25.537
The British burned it down in 1814,
but we rebuilt it.

01:26.962 --> 01:28.669
Patrick Lloyd blew it to pieces.

01:29.506 --> 01:31.338
We rebuilt it again.

01:33.802 --> 01:36.134
It's just masonry and paint.

01:36.722 --> 01:38.508
Why do you think
it means so much?

01:39.725 --> 01:42.342
Because it's, um, a symbol, sir.

01:42.477 --> 01:44.514
A symbol that nearly bankrupted us.

01:44.646 --> 01:49.015
You honestly think that this glorified
office building's worth $7 billion?

01:49.151 --> 01:50.687
No, sir.

01:51.320 --> 01:53.311
| think it's worth
a whole lot more.

01:54.865 --> 01:56.321
Damn right.

02:02.205 --> 02:03.411
Morning, sir.

02:03.540 --> 02:05.451
[man] And what about
the rebuilt Capitol?

02:05.584 --> 02:08.918
They should call it Kirkman's Folly.
He rebuilt it in one year.

02:09.045 --> 02:10.411
Cost overruns. Overtime.

02:10.547 --> 02:11.787
And as an encore,

02:11.923 --> 02:13.914
he jams through
an emergency defense bill

02:14.051 --> 02:15.758
after Lloyd's Pentagon hack.

02:15.886 --> 02:18.093
-Good morning, Mr. President.
-Good morning.

02:18.221 --> 02:19.632
Lloyd couldn't kill Kirkman,

02:19.765 --> 02:22.257
<i>so he's killing his presidency
one dollar at a time.</i>

02:22.392 --> 02:23.769
Lloyd's greatest shot

02:23.894 --> 02:25.760
was the one he didn't fire--
[cellphone beeps]

02:25.896 --> 02:27.762
-Good morning, Mr. President.
-Good morning.

02:28.398 --> 02:30.776
One year in. Someone
should have baked a cake.

02:31.401 --> 02:34.189
-Yes, sir.
-Because this is a festive occasion.

02:34.404 --> 02:35.394
Yes, sir.

02:36.907 --> 02:38.068
You're saying "Yes, sir"

02:38.200 --> 02:40.282
because I'm the President
of the United States, right?

02:40.410 --> 02:41.571
Yes, sir.

02:43.580 --> 02:44.786
[sighs]

02:46.416 --> 02:48.157
| need some water.
[phone rings]

02:48.293 --> 02:50.159
Okay. Sasha, can you get us
a bottle of water?

02:50.295 --> 02:51.797
Oh, bottled water?
No, thank you.

02:51.922 --> 02:53.128
BPAs.

02:53.256 --> 02:54.462
We'll find you a fountain.

02:54.591 --> 02:56.298
[laughs]
This building is 200 years old.

02:56.426 --> 02:58.292
You know how much lead
those pipes are leaching?

02:58.428 --> 02:59.680
That's all the water we have.

02:59.805 --> 03:01.591
-Really?
-Yep. Lyor, look.

03:01.723 --> 03:04.806
Hi. Lyor, I've spent six months
trying to convince the President

03:04.935 --> 03:06.346
to hire a political director.

03:06.478 --> 03:08.139
If you blow this,

03:08.271 --> 03:10.649
you won't get within a ZIP code
of the White House again.

03:10.774 --> 03:12.606
[indistinct conversations]

03:13.443 --> 03:15.309
Well, at least I'll be well hydrated.

03:15.445 --> 03:17.982
Two presidential campaigns,
nine senatorial ones,

03:18.115 --> 03:19.697
and adviser to Cameron.

03:19.825 --> 03:22.783
Two PhDs from Chicago
in Philosophy and History.

03:22.911 --> 03:24.493
Did you study
with Paul Bridgeman?

03:24.621 --> 03:26.453
Ah, yes, sir. I didn't like him.

03:30.127 --> 03:31.492
You're good on paper,

03:31.628 --> 03:32.834
and Emily says
you're the smartest person

03:32.963 --> 03:34.704
that she's ever worked with.

03:34.840 --> 03:38.834
So, why do you think
| need a political director?

03:38.969 --> 03:41.336
Sir, what do you want
out of your presidency?

03:42.097 --> 03:44.509
My initial goals were
to stabilize the country

03:44.641 --> 03:47.508
and try and lead the American people
back from a terrible tragedy.

03:47.644 --> 03:50.978
But now, I want them to believe
in their government again.

03:51.106 --> 03:53.347
| want them to trust
that their vote matters

03:53.483 --> 03:55.895
and know that they have a say
in their own destiny.

03:56.027 --> 03:57.358
But the only way that happens

03:57.487 --> 03:59.228
is for the American people
to believe in you,

03:59.364 --> 04:01.321
-and currently the polls say--
- I don't care about the polls.

04:01.450 --> 04:03.532
-You should, sir.
-No, I shouldn't.

04:03.660 --> 04:07.324
The polls didn't make any headway on
clean energy or fill judicial vacancies.

04:07.456 --> 04:08.491
The only thing that really matters

04:08.623 --> 04:11.490
is the actual work that we get done here
on behalf of the American people.

04:11.626 --> 04:12.878
But only if they know about it.

04:13.003 --> 04:16.166
Appearance is reality,
and the reality here

04:16.298 --> 04:18.414
is that people think
you're not doing a good job.

04:18.550 --> 04:20.416
I'm guessing that we're still
talking about the polls.

04:20.552 --> 04:22.338
Sir, you need approval ratings
to get a mandate.

04:22.471 --> 04:23.882
No mandate,
Congress won't listen to you.

04:24.014 --> 04:25.675
If Congress doesn't listen,
you can't govern.

04:25.807 --> 04:28.094
Yet I come into this office
every day and do exactly that.

04:28.226 --> 04:29.512
Well, yes,
but not effectively.

04:29.644 --> 04:31.601
| mean, your legislation's
stuck in the pipeline.

04:31.730 --> 04:33.016
| think I know the chorus.

04:33.148 --> 04:35.389
Did you know that James Garfield
had better numbers that you?

04:35.525 --> 04:36.856
And someone shot him.

04:36.985 --> 04:39.022
| think what Lyor's trying
to say here, sir, is--

04:39.154 --> 04:40.394
Emily, I don't need a translation.

04:40.906 --> 04:43.864
Mr. Boone here doesn't mince his words.
He just likes to repeat them.

04:44.534 --> 04:46.400
But you're candid, and I value that.

04:47.537 --> 04:49.448
| would like to try this on a trial basis.

04:49.581 --> 04:51.697
| think that would be best
for both of us.

04:51.833 --> 04:55.201
If it's okay, I'd like to start by
observing. Just dip my toe in the water?

04:55.337 --> 04:57.874
-But not the White House water 'cause--
-I'll show him to his office.

04:59.758 --> 05:02.045
Mr. President.
We have a situation.

05:02.511 --> 05:03.592
[ominous tone plays]

05:03.720 --> 05:06.212
[Nick] Federated Russian Air 342...

05:06.348 --> 05:09.306
[all screaming]

05:09.434 --> 05:11.892
...hijacked at Chicago Metro
20 minutes ago.

05:12.020 --> 05:14.432
Mr. Director, I fought very hard
to add billions of dollars

05:14.564 --> 05:17.602
to Homeland Security's budget,
because the procedures in place--

05:17.734 --> 05:19.566
Are clearly insufficient, sir.

05:19.694 --> 05:21.560
Aaron's asked us
to overhaul our protocol.

05:21.696 --> 05:23.027
We'll make it a priority.

05:23.573 --> 05:24.859
How the hell did they do this?

05:25.575 --> 05:27.782
Ceramic knives, sir.

05:27.911 --> 05:30.778
There are four hijackers, sir.
They haven't made any demands yet.

05:30.914 --> 05:31.949
What's the passenger count?

05:32.082 --> 05:34.744
165, 68 Americans.

05:37.963 --> 05:40.204

06:18.128 --> 06:19.163

06:19.296 --> 06:20.707
No, I gotta go home.

06:21.923 --> 06:23.004
So early?

06:24.009 --> 06:26.125

-Excuse me.

Buenos Aires, Nairobi,

07:18.021 --> 07:19.762
Oslo, Amsterdam.

07:19.898 --> 07:21.263
What can you tell me
about them?

07:21.399 --> 07:23.436
Nothing. They don't link
to residences or businesses,

07:23.568 --> 07:24.683
and I think I know why.

07:24.819 --> 07:27.072
These cities are all nodes
for the dark web.

07:27.197 --> 07:28.278
Locations of folks Lloyd's been paying

07:28.406 --> 07:30.067
to keep him off the grid
for the past six months.

07:30.200 --> 07:31.065

07:31.201 --> 07:33.442
| sent you the Amsterdam coordinates.
Hannah, this guy was Special Forces.

07:33.578 --> 07:35.956
You better have back-up.
Do not go after Lloyd alone.

08:23.253 --> 08:25.290
Why are you British all of a sudden?

08:25.422 --> 08:28.130
Why do Americans
ask so many questions?

08:28.258 --> 08:30.465
You're an Englishman

09:11.968 --> 09:14.300
My name's Damien Rennett,

09:14.429 --> 09:16.545
and you're a long way
from home, Ms. Wells.

09:16.681 --> 09:19.423
Thought you were one of the guys
on Lloyd's payroll.

09:19.976 --> 09:21.717
I've been tracking you for a week.

09:21.853 --> 09:24.015
I've been tracking you for two.

09:24.606 --> 09:25.641
[scoffs]

09:25.982 --> 09:27.484
Sorry about your head.

09:27.984 --> 09:29.645
How long have you been
on Lloyd's trail?

09:29.778 --> 09:32.736
Months. I'm closing in, but,
you know, a guy with his assets,

09:32.864 --> 09:34.354
he's still got a lot of trap doors.

09:34.491 --> 09:37.358
But I'm surprised to find
British Intelligence on this.

09:37.494 --> 09:40.987
Lloyd owns £200 million
worth of property in England.

09:41.998 --> 09:44.080
Well, as long as we're following
the same breadcrumbs,

09:44.209 --> 09:45.916
we might as well pool our resources.

09:46.044 --> 09:47.205
Agreed.

09:50.507 --> 09:53.841
Young, tech guy, old-timey clock?

10:04.354 --> 10:05.389
Let's hard-wire it.

10:12.028 --> 10:14.486
Ah, there's our boy.

10:16.074 --> 10:18.190
Lloyd knows we're getting closer.

10:18.660 --> 10:20.367
He's covering his tracks.

10:26.334 --> 10:28.371
What do we know about the hijackers?

10:28.503 --> 10:31.120
Not much. DNI's pulling up
some profiles as we speak.

10:31.256 --> 10:33.247
Let me know as soon
as they've got an assessment.

10:33.383 --> 10:35.124
Here's the passenger manifest, sir.

10:35.260 --> 10:38.048
It includes a humanitarian
mission from the WHO.

10:38.680 --> 10:41.718
They were hoping to cross into Ukraine,
deliver medical supplies.

10:55.613 --> 10:57.069
Mr. President?

11:00.285 --> 11:02.572
These people hijacked
a plane on U.S. soil

11:02.704 --> 11:05.162
in an effort to pull the West
into a regional conflict,

11:05.290 --> 11:07.281
and they're willing
to kill Americans to do it.

11:07.917 --> 11:10.955
Right now, both of you should be huddling
with the Ukrainian and Russian ambassadors

11:11.087 --> 11:14.455
because Russia will use this
as an excuse to attack Ukraine.

11:14.591 --> 11:17.504
We need to get them talking.
That's our job.

11:17.635 --> 11:18.625
Let's get it done.

11:18.761 --> 11:20.092
-Will do, sir.
-Yeah.

11:29.105 --> 11:30.846
You take Shevchenko,
I'll take Pavlov.

11:30.982 --> 11:33.815
-Shevchenko doesn't like me.
-Pavlov doesn't like you either.

11:33.943 --> 11:35.195
That's true.

11:35.320 --> 11:37.186
You're the President's
National Security adviser.

11:37.322 --> 11:38.653
Any words of wisdom?

11:38.781 --> 11:40.738
Yes, we shouldn't be
feeling very secure.

11:41.409 --> 11:42.820
[sighs]

11:42.952 --> 11:45.990
Ukraine has no association
with these men or their crime,

11:46.122 --> 11:48.204
and I resent outrageous implication.

11:48.333 --> 11:51.166
No, I'm not implying anything,
Mr. Ambassador.

11:51.294 --> 11:54.002
We are simply asking for Russian
assistance, Mr. Ambassador.

11:54.130 --> 11:57.122
Russia does not negotiate
with terrorists.

11:57.258 --> 12:00.626
I'm asking whether your government
can influence Ukrainian citizens.

12:00.762 --> 12:01.968
Terrorists.

12:02.972 --> 12:04.713
Terrorists who are Ukrainian.

12:04.849 --> 12:08.638
We are just asking for you
to take the diplomatic initiative.

12:08.770 --> 12:12.684
Let's begin with U.S. response
to illegal Russian invasion of my country.

12:12.815 --> 12:15.022
You know why this plane
wasn't hijacked in Russia?

12:15.151 --> 12:18.360
Because these animals know
we have ways of dealing with them.

12:18.488 --> 12:22.698
We co-sponsored a U.N. resolution
condemning Russia's aggression.

12:22.825 --> 12:24.532
We continue to pressure them
on this front.

12:24.661 --> 12:28.245
You summon me, "Mr. Ambassador,
terror happening in America.

12:28.373 --> 12:30.159
Ukraine must fix."

12:30.291 --> 12:35.161
With pleasure, right after
America fix terror in Ukraine.

12:37.215 --> 12:41.209
This hijacking is an attack
on a Russian entity,

12:41.344 --> 12:46.305
so with respect,
we decide how we respond.

12:46.683 --> 12:48.674
And to use an American phrase...

12:50.019 --> 12:52.135
we don't cry uncle.

12:55.066 --> 12:57.228
[machinery whirring]

12:57.360 --> 13:00.068
We ship 40,000 electric cars
a month, Seth.

13:00.196 --> 13:03.780
Zero emissions,
built by computers, affordable.

13:03.908 --> 13:05.444
It's impressive.

13:05.576 --> 13:07.738
Except we should be
shipping twice that.

13:07.870 --> 13:11.204
Our problem's not product, it's PR.

13:12.583 --> 13:14.369
And that's where you come in.

13:14.502 --> 13:15.913
| already have a job.

13:16.671 --> 13:17.911
Let's be frank, Seth.

13:18.840 --> 13:23.255
You guys are in a terminal tailspin,
and that makes you a distressed asset,

13:23.386 --> 13:26.253
which means your value
will continue to depreciate.

13:26.389 --> 13:30.223
But right now, today,
you're still a commodity.

13:32.687 --> 13:34.269
Two more years in the White House,

13:34.397 --> 13:37.890
you'll get a job as editorial director
of a magazine no one will read.

13:38.568 --> 13:40.479
Two years as my head of marketing,

13:40.611 --> 13:42.739
you can buy that magazine.

13:42.864 --> 13:44.730
[cellphone rings]

13:44.866 --> 13:45.822
[cellphone beeps]

13:45.950 --> 13:46.985
Excuse me.

13:47.118 --> 13:48.404
Yeah?

13:49.245 --> 13:51.077
[reporters clamoring]
The hijackers are Ukrainian nationals.

13:51.205 --> 13:54.288
They're a group calling
themselves Osovobodit Ukrainu.

13:54.417 --> 13:57.580
-What are they asking for?
-Negotiations on the status of Crimea.

13:57.712 --> 14:00.750
Ukraine is demanding an immediate
withdrawal of Russia's occupation.

14:00.882 --> 14:02.464
Now, DHS is monitoring the situation,

14:02.592 --> 14:05.129
and we have some FBI hostage negotiation
teams on site.

14:05.261 --> 14:06.968
Is Patrick Lloyd linked to this?

14:07.096 --> 14:08.302
We have no evidence of that.

14:08.431 --> 14:11.298
But this isn't technically inconsistent
with his modus operandi, is it?

14:11.434 --> 14:13.641
Patrick Lloyd is one of the most
hunted people on earth.

14:13.770 --> 14:16.933
His businesses have been closed,
his co-conspirators have been arrested,

14:17.065 --> 14:18.931
and he hasn't been heard from
in half a year,

14:19.067 --> 14:20.978
yet somehow, guys,
every third question is about--

14:21.110 --> 14:22.896
So you're not ruling him out?

14:23.654 --> 14:26.612
On current information, Patrick Lloyd had
nothing to do with the hijacking.

14:26.741 --> 14:28.823
Or the listeria outbreak
in New Hampshire,

14:28.951 --> 14:30.612
or with global warming.
Any other questions?

14:30.745 --> 14:33.783
C-can you at least update the status
of the Lloyd investigation?

14:33.915 --> 14:36.156
Yes, all our best people are on it.
Thank you.

14:36.292 --> 14:38.533
-[indistinct shouting]
[reporter] Seth. Seth!

14:38.669 --> 14:40.626
-That was a real beauty.
-Yeah, well, they keep asking

14:40.755 --> 14:42.621
the same questions
expecting different answers,

14:42.757 --> 14:45.624
-so I figured I'd try a different tack.
-Naked hostility?

14:45.760 --> 14:47.376
Yeah, sometimes it's stick,
sometimes it's carrot.

14:47.512 --> 14:49.469
Oh, we need your latest
hijacking update out immediately.

14:49.597 --> 14:51.008
I've asked Lyor Boone to take a look.

14:51.140 --> 14:52.642
-Who?
-He's auditioning for P.D.

14:52.767 --> 14:54.223
Ooh, and Elias Grandy's
in the West Wing.

14:54.352 --> 14:57.185
-Come on, I thought you brushed him off.
-I've brushed him off six times.

14:57.313 --> 15:00.146
He's the only National Medal for the Arts
recipient the President hasn't met,

15:00.274 --> 15:01.730
and he's insistent
on meeting all of them.

15:01.859 --> 15:04.191
Oh, Grandy's a poison pen,
biting political satire,

15:04.320 --> 15:06.687
not the kind of guy who should be
pressing flesh with the President,

15:06.823 --> 15:08.484
especially not when the water's
rising around here.

15:08.616 --> 15:11.654
-Tell me something I don't know.
-Um, I can play "Chopsticks" with my feet.

15:11.786 --> 15:14.198
Why don't you use those
to sashay over to Reception?

15:14.330 --> 15:16.537
Grandy's been there two hours.
Just stash him somewhere.

15:16.666 --> 15:19.078
If the President frees up,
we'll do a drive-by, 30 seconds tops.

15:19.210 --> 15:20.541
That's 30 seconds too long.

15:20.670 --> 15:22.001
We appreciate your patience, Mr. Grandy.

15:22.130 --> 15:23.746
The President's been pulled away
on an urgent matter,

15:23.881 --> 15:25.383
but he should be with you shortly.

15:25.508 --> 15:27.249
-I can come back.
-Oh, that won't be necessary.

15:27.385 --> 15:28.546
Just make yourself comfortable.

15:29.720 --> 15:30.710
[door closes]

15:39.564 --> 15:40.850
-Uh, excuse me.
-Oh, hello.

15:40.982 --> 15:43.440
-Lyor Boone. I'm gonna be observing--
-I know. What are you doing?

15:43.568 --> 15:45.229
I'm just looking for a pen.
| figured you're a writer,

15:45.361 --> 15:47.853
you might have a lot of them.
You do. It's quite a selection here.

15:47.989 --> 15:49.320
This is an ergonomic match.
How much?

15:49.740 --> 15:50.696
How much?

15:50.825 --> 15:53.613
| have $16. I've got a Slinky,
uh, half an egg salad sandwich.

15:53.744 --> 15:55.280
Yeah, we're pretty lousy
with pens around here,

15:55.413 --> 15:56.778
so knock yourself out.

15:56.914 --> 15:58.951
Really? Thanks.
Oh, and here are a few notes

15:59.083 --> 16:01.700
on your press release about
the Federated Russian Air thing.

16:01.836 --> 16:03.998
Yeah, I only had a problem
with the first two pages.

16:06.007 --> 16:07.372
It is two pages!

16:07.508 --> 16:08.714
[knocking on door]

16:08.843 --> 16:09.753
[door opens]

16:14.223 --> 16:17.716
Chicken korma from Rasika,
and you're not gonna touch it?

16:19.020 --> 16:20.556
Sorry, I'm just not hungry.

16:20.688 --> 16:22.099
The hijacking, right?

16:22.231 --> 16:25.565
A little while ago, they gave me
the passenger manifest.

16:25.693 --> 16:27.730
Russell Donson's on the plane.

16:27.862 --> 16:30.900
Russ? Oh, my God.

16:31.532 --> 16:33.114
Part of a humanitarian mission.

16:33.242 --> 16:35.279
Oh, my God, we haven't
seen him in so long.

16:35.411 --> 16:36.492
You know, I feel so bad.

16:36.621 --> 16:39.409
| haven't even called Rena since
you took over the presidency.

16:39.540 --> 16:41.451
It's kind of sad
that we all drifted apart.

16:41.584 --> 16:43.245
We didn't drift apart, Alex.

16:43.377 --> 16:44.629
Russell and I fell out.

16:44.754 --> 16:46.461
What are you talking about?

16:46.589 --> 16:49.798
[sighs] When we came back from
the Peace Corps in Naruba, remember?

16:51.052 --> 16:53.168
Then you got into Stanford's
doctoral program,

16:53.304 --> 16:57.298
and he and Rena left
on a mission to Ghana

16:57.433 --> 16:58.673
about a week later.

16:58.809 --> 17:00.937
| promised Russell
| would go on that mission.

17:02.271 --> 17:04.523
Stanford came knocking,
| couldn't turn it down.

17:04.648 --> 17:05.980
Russell called me a sell-out.

17:06.108 --> 17:08.816
| called him a sanctimonious
son of a bitch. It took off from there.

17:08.944 --> 17:12.108
Wow. W-Why didn't you tell me?

17:13.449 --> 17:14.609
[exhales]

17:15.117 --> 17:17.779
"Cause I didn't want you
to think I was a sell-out, too.

17:19.454 --> 17:21.617
We'd all made a pact together
to change the world

17:21.749 --> 17:23.615
from the ground up, brick by brick.

17:24.085 --> 17:26.452
Leo had just been born.

17:27.088 --> 17:29.671
| kept telling myself I was thinking
about my family,

17:29.799 --> 17:32.086
but I... I was thinking about myself.

17:33.094 --> 17:35.176
And I broke a promise to my best friend,

17:35.304 --> 17:37.341
and now he's on that plane.

17:37.473 --> 17:38.975
And if they connect him to me...

17:39.100 --> 17:40.590
He becomes a bargaining chip.

17:41.310 --> 17:42.687
If he's lucky.

17:48.693 --> 17:49.808
[door opens]

17:49.944 --> 17:53.482
They want us to help them broker a deal
with the Russians for $47 billion?

17:53.614 --> 17:55.855
Money they say Russia stole
from the Ukrainian treasury.

17:55.992 --> 17:59.326
They also want repatriation
of the remains of Ukrainian nationalists.

17:59.453 --> 18:00.864
Yeah, the demands keep escalating.

18:00.997 --> 18:02.988
If they're not met, they start killing
passengers at midnight,

18:03.124 --> 18:04.535
beginning with Americans.

18:04.667 --> 18:07.750
We're getting word of a Russian
naval buildup in the Sea of Azov.

18:07.878 --> 18:09.585
Ukraine's not part of NATO, but Turkey is.

18:09.714 --> 18:12.046
If Russia starts flexing
its muscle too close to Turkey,

18:12.174 --> 18:15.508
NATO's gonna have to scramble their fleet,
which will implicate our troops.

18:16.512 --> 18:17.718
Thank you, Mike.

18:21.892 --> 18:23.678
Son of a bitch.

18:24.353 --> 18:26.936
Satellite imagery shows
the Russian Sixth Army

18:27.064 --> 18:28.680
massing at the Ukrainian border.

18:28.816 --> 18:30.727
-What's our timeline?
-We're eight hours in.

18:30.860 --> 18:32.942
Hostage negotiators tell me
if these situations

18:33.070 --> 18:35.687
don't resolve in the first day,
they usually end violently.

18:35.823 --> 18:37.109
Where the hell's
the Secretary-General?

18:37.241 --> 18:38.948
-Wheels down at Andrews.
-Get him here now.

18:39.076 --> 18:40.692
If this thing looks
like it's cratering,

18:40.828 --> 18:42.535
the President's gonna want
those tactical options.

18:42.663 --> 18:44.745
-Having them drawn up as we speak.
-Good.

18:45.416 --> 18:49.080
Dev... Devon Braverman from The Times
called me for a comment, by the way.

18:49.211 --> 18:50.292
Why would he call you?

18:50.421 --> 18:51.957
Well, Seth hung up on him, twice.

18:52.089 --> 18:54.421
You don't hang up on a Pulitzer
Prize-winning columnist.

18:54.550 --> 18:56.632
Looks like our boy's going
through a bit of a rough patch.

18:56.761 --> 18:57.626
He'll get through it.

18:57.762 --> 18:58.627
-Emily?
-Yep?

18:58.763 --> 19:01.095
There's a V.A. Committee meeting
in the Roosevelt Room in 30.

19:01.223 --> 19:02.384
Oh, Lenny's running point on that.

19:02.516 --> 19:04.382
Yes, but some writer said
Seth said to stay there.

19:04.518 --> 19:05.553
Right, sorry. Thank you.

19:05.686 --> 19:07.802
Uh, Elias Grandy, Aaron.
Can you handle it?

19:07.938 --> 19:09.554
Yeah, not my job.

19:10.024 --> 19:11.810
True, but it's my job

19:11.942 --> 19:14.400
to make sure that trains are
running on time around here,

19:14.528 --> 19:17.395
so technically you report to me,
meaning your job just expanded.

19:19.909 --> 19:21.070
[sighs]

19:21.202 --> 19:23.489
Sorry, the President's still tied up,
Mr. Grandy.

19:23.621 --> 19:25.282
- I can come back.
-No, just hang tight,

19:25.414 --> 19:26.950
and let us know
if you need anything.

19:27.083 --> 19:28.573
A-actually,
I-I haven't eaten yet--

19:28.709 --> 19:29.824
-[cellphone rings]
-Excuse me a moment.

19:29.960 --> 19:31.291
Yeah, Aaron Shore.

19:41.430 --> 19:43.637
-Your Newton's cradle.
-Yeah.

19:43.766 --> 19:46.224
You know, Newton didn't even invent it;
John Wallis did.

19:47.937 --> 19:49.143
It's odd, right?

19:49.271 --> 19:50.602
Anything I can help you with?

19:50.731 --> 19:54.224
Yes. I was wondering...
What product do you use?

19:54.610 --> 19:55.645
Product?

19:55.778 --> 19:57.439
On your face.
Your skin is luminous.

19:57.571 --> 19:59.653
Is it glycolic acid?
Nightingale droppings?

19:59.782 --> 20:01.489
-Pumice?
-Soap and water.

20:02.159 --> 20:03.115
Huh.

20:04.453 --> 20:05.659
Uh, thank you.

20:05.788 --> 20:09.031
Yeah, it's important,
the products we use, you know?

20:09.166 --> 20:10.668
Kind of like the words we use.

20:10.793 --> 20:13.125
And the words
this administration's using:

20:13.254 --> 20:14.494
no good.

20:14.630 --> 20:16.667
[sighs]
Any words in particular?

20:16.799 --> 20:18.289
I'm compiling a list, actually, yeah.

20:18.426 --> 20:20.212
| think there should be
a lexicon of bad words.

20:20.344 --> 20:22.176
You think I should talk to Seth
about that?

20:22.638 --> 20:26.051
Sure. Telling a writer what words to use
is always a great idea.

20:26.183 --> 20:28.265
Oh, and the hotel you met
the Ukrainian ambassador at:

20:28.853 --> 20:29.843
terrible.

20:31.647 --> 20:33.263
-I'll make a note.
-Good.

20:34.942 --> 20:36.023
Good talk.

20:38.779 --> 20:39.940
[cellphone buzzing]

20:42.158 --> 20:43.239
Talk to me.

20:43.367 --> 20:45.699
[Hannah] I'm in Amsterdam,
12 hours behind Lloyd.

20:45.828 --> 20:48.035
-Wait, I thought he was in Budapest.
-Not anymore.

20:48.164 --> 20:50.997
He knocked off a confederate who was
fronting for his purchases here.

20:51.125 --> 20:52.911
This guy's computer
has a Bitcoin account

20:53.043 --> 20:55.080
that was accessed a few minutes
before he died.

20:55.212 --> 20:57.590
That account was used to buy
half-a-million dollars in computers

20:57.715 --> 20:59.331
on the black market a week ago.

20:59.467 --> 21:01.549
Wait, w-what's Lloyd
using computers for?

21:01.677 --> 21:02.883
I'm gonna find out.

21:03.012 --> 21:04.502
A source tells me that,
in Amsterdam,

21:04.638 --> 21:07.016
there's only one seller who can
move that volume of equipment,

21:07.141 --> 21:10.179
so I'm on the way to the warehouse now.
But, Aaron, we're closing in.

21:10.311 --> 21:11.893
All these months of cat and mouse,

21:12.021 --> 21:13.386
we've run him into the ground.

21:13.522 --> 21:16.765
| don't want to bring the President in
the loop yet until we firm up the intel.

21:16.901 --> 21:19.142
| mean, anything breaks...
-Yeah, I got you on speed dial.

21:19.528 --> 21:20.814
One last thing...

21:21.155 --> 21:23.863
Hey, you turn up dead,
I'm gonna look really bad.

21:24.533 --> 21:25.694
Thanks, Coach.

21:27.036 --> 21:29.277
[Egon] I didn't know
who the purchaser was.

21:29.413 --> 21:30.869
| don't meet my customers.

21:30.998 --> 21:33.285
They sent Bitcoin, I sent goods.

21:33.417 --> 21:35.499
Okay, so tell us
where you sent the computers.

21:36.337 --> 21:38.578
No. I am paid for discretion.

21:40.257 --> 21:43.045
[in Dutch]

21:43.552 --> 21:45.418
Actually, no. No politie.

21:45.554 --> 21:48.262
If he doesn't want to cooperate,
let's just leave him to Patrick Lloyd.

21:48.724 --> 21:51.512
He's a loose end.
He doesn't like loose ends.

21:52.186 --> 21:53.221
Wait.

21:54.188 --> 21:56.350
I'll tell you
where Lloyd's computers are.

21:58.734 --> 22:01.601
Both sides have rejected
our diplomatic initiative.

22:01.737 --> 22:03.478
Each one thinks
we're on the other's side,

22:03.614 --> 22:07.073
so we were hoping that the U.N.
could step in as a neutral arbiter.

22:07.201 --> 22:08.612
We have tried, sir.

22:08.744 --> 22:11.406
Neither Russia or Ukraine
is willing to engage us.

22:13.415 --> 22:15.076
[scoffs] Something's off with this.

22:15.209 --> 22:16.995
Both sides refuse to negotiate.

22:17.127 --> 22:19.459
Both sides refuse
a third-party intervention.

22:19.588 --> 22:21.670
The hijackers keep changing
their demands,

22:21.799 --> 22:24.461
making it impossible for us
to meet them even if we wanted to,

22:24.593 --> 22:27.631
which they know we can't because
we don't negotiate with terrorists.

22:27.763 --> 22:30.755
It's like both sides want
the situation to deteriorate.

22:33.143 --> 22:34.759
[exhales]

22:35.271 --> 22:36.978
Yes, it's exactly like that.

22:37.106 --> 22:40.644
Thank you, Mr. Secretary-General,
for getting here so quickly.

22:41.235 --> 22:43.101
| wish I could've been more of service.

22:43.779 --> 22:44.814
Thank you.

22:46.574 --> 22:48.281
Forensic accounting just dug this up.

22:48.409 --> 22:50.025
Fully funded Swiss bank accounts
were opened

22:50.160 --> 22:52.413
in each of the hijackers' names
three days ago.

23:01.005 --> 23:02.791
Wait a second.

23:02.923 --> 23:06.211
This shows the money traces back
to a state-run Russian bank.

23:06.343 --> 23:10.758
Why would Russia pay Ukrainian
separatists to hijack a Russian jet?

23:13.684 --> 23:15.800
Russia's looking for a pretext for war.

23:15.936 --> 23:18.223
Ukraine's happy to sit on its hands,
let things escalate.

23:18.355 --> 23:20.471
Russia attacks, and the world finally
takes note of their plight.

23:20.608 --> 23:22.849
While we waste our time
with shuttle diplomacy,

23:22.985 --> 23:26.148
which neither side wants.
165 lives hang in the balance.

23:26.280 --> 23:28.021
I'll get the Russian and
Ukrainian ambassadors here.

23:28.157 --> 23:30.068
| want them both in my office
at the same time.

23:30.200 --> 23:31.326
Yes, sir.

23:38.334 --> 23:39.495
Sasha?

23:40.377 --> 23:41.754
Can I get a goji kombucha?

23:41.879 --> 23:43.540
-We're out.
-Send an intern.

23:43.672 --> 23:44.833
No, Northwest D.C. is out.

23:44.965 --> 23:47.548
Someone bought up 60 crates last night
from the local distributor.

23:47.676 --> 23:50.168
Who would buy 60 crates of goji kombucha?

23:50.304 --> 23:51.920
Funny you should ask.

23:52.056 --> 23:54.047
[Emily] So you don't drink goji kombucha.

23:54.183 --> 23:55.218
No. No, I hate it.

23:55.351 --> 23:56.591
Then why would you buy 60 crates?

23:56.727 --> 23:58.388
-Because I hate it.
-Let's try this again.

23:58.520 --> 24:01.729
| have an olfactory sensitivity
to fermented goji products.

24:01.857 --> 24:04.189
It would be presumptuous of me
to ask anyone in the White House

24:04.318 --> 24:06.059
not to drink it, so I removed it
from consideration.

24:06.195 --> 24:07.526
-60 crates.
-Oh, don't worry,

24:07.655 --> 24:09.441
| found a reseller
who's moving them out of state.

24:09.573 --> 24:10.904
I'm actually making a profit.

24:11.033 --> 24:12.615
Lyor, you can't control what I drink.

24:12.743 --> 24:15.235
Well, maybe not, but I can make
failure a virtue.

24:15.371 --> 24:17.863
You know, that's a little...
That's pretty good.

24:17.998 --> 24:19.909
It should be the motto
of the White House...

24:20.042 --> 24:22.704
Hey, Lyor! Do you think maybe
since I stuck my neck out for you,

24:22.836 --> 24:25.214
you could act like someone who didn't
just escape from an asylum?

24:26.256 --> 24:27.382
Wow.

24:29.093 --> 24:31.380
-You really like goji kombucha.
-[scoffs] My God!

24:32.221 --> 24:34.883
Hey, Seth. Your release
on the hostage crisis;

24:35.015 --> 24:36.597
it's a little combative.

24:36.725 --> 24:39.592
Hijackings are combative.
They call for muscular language.

24:39.728 --> 24:40.934
What did Lyor say?

24:41.063 --> 24:43.395
He put an "X"
through both pages.

24:43.524 --> 24:45.310
| feel like he couldn't find
his lighter fluid.

24:45.442 --> 24:48.059
He can be a little direct,
but he's brilliant.

24:48.195 --> 24:49.651
Speaker Fenton was dead in the polls,

24:49.780 --> 24:52.772
and I watched him resuscitate his
campaign and water-into-wine stuff.

24:52.908 --> 24:54.239
That was eight years ago, right?

24:54.368 --> 24:56.826
| feel like he's been dropped on his head
since then, repeatedly.

24:56.954 --> 24:57.944
He'll grow on you.

24:58.080 --> 25:00.117
Look, I got a lot of cooks
in my soup already.

25:00.249 --> 25:02.286
| would've appreciated the heads-up
before you looped him in.

25:02.418 --> 25:05.410
The President signed off on him last
night. I was looking for you this morning.

25:05.546 --> 25:06.957
-Oh. Doctor's appointment.
-Everything okay?

25:07.089 --> 25:09.126
Yeah, just a routine check-up.
Thank you for the name.

25:09.258 --> 25:10.589
-Dr. Wetzel?
-Yep.

25:10.718 --> 25:12.550
Dr. Wetzel's on vacation all month.

25:16.765 --> 25:18.551
-Oh, my God.
-Come here.

25:19.435 --> 25:20.300
You're gonna quit.

25:20.436 --> 25:22.143
-I'm not quitting.
-Then where were you?

25:22.271 --> 25:23.761
[background chatter]

25:24.440 --> 25:26.647
| was at a meet and greet
with Dax Minter.

25:26.775 --> 25:27.765
Dax Minter of Kwellis?

25:27.901 --> 25:30.279
Yeah. Minter cold-calls you,
you don't thumb your nose at him.

25:30.404 --> 25:33.863
You do if you work in the White House.
| didn't know you were so unhappy.

25:33.991 --> 25:34.856
| never said that.

25:34.992 --> 25:36.653
No, you just snuck off for an interview

25:36.785 --> 25:38.947
and lied about it because
of your high job satisfaction.

25:39.079 --> 25:40.820
-It's complicated.
-No, it's simple.

25:40.956 --> 25:43.323
The ship's taking on water,
and you're looking for a lifeboat.

25:43.459 --> 25:45.370
| mean, the President deserves
a modicum of loyalty.

25:45.502 --> 25:47.038
Modicum? Emily,
| work 18 hours a day.

25:47.171 --> 25:48.661
You know what I accomplish?
Nothing.

25:48.797 --> 25:49.958
-We--
-No, listen.

25:50.090 --> 25:52.172
My only job is to make things
sound better,

25:52.301 --> 25:54.133
and every word
that comes out of my mouth,

25:54.261 --> 25:55.672
| make them sound worse.

25:55.804 --> 25:58.842
| mean, I-I'm like
the herald of doom around here.

26:01.810 --> 26:03.676
You don't want to leave
because the ship's sinking.

26:03.812 --> 26:06.099
You want to leave because
you think you're sinking it.

26:07.191 --> 26:09.102
- I don't matter.
-You matter to me.

26:13.155 --> 26:15.146
And to everyone in this building.

26:15.991 --> 26:17.698
But here's the thing;

26:17.826 --> 26:19.692
my job is to protect the President.

26:19.828 --> 26:22.911
So if you're not all in, you're all out.

26:23.040 --> 26:24.075
Emily.

26:24.208 --> 26:27.291
You have until the end of the day
to decide, or I decide for you.

26:31.715 --> 26:33.706
Sorry, but the President's still tied up.

26:33.842 --> 26:35.094
He'll be with you shortly.

26:35.219 --> 26:38.337
I-I can go home, really.
| like my home.

26:40.724 --> 26:43.341
Shouldn't be long now.
You gonna be okay here?

26:43.685 --> 26:45.551
Would it matter if I said no?

26:45.687 --> 26:47.064
Probably not.

26:54.571 --> 26:56.187
[chuckles]

27:14.758 --> 27:16.499
Mr. President, the ambassadors are here.

27:17.553 --> 27:18.543
Thank you.

27:20.931 --> 27:22.342
[sighs]

27:23.267 --> 27:26.430
Don't bother sitting down.
You won't be here long enough.

27:26.562 --> 27:28.223
Mr. President, my country--

27:28.355 --> 27:30.471
Has done absolutely nothing
but sit on its hands.

27:30.607 --> 27:32.143
Not a single overture to the hijackers.

27:32.276 --> 27:34.813
Yes, because they do not listen to us.

27:34.945 --> 27:36.231
And your country, Ambassador Pavlov...

27:36.905 --> 27:38.487
Does not negotiate with terrorists.

27:38.615 --> 27:40.276
Especially with the ones they're paying.

27:41.243 --> 27:42.654
[exhales]
Mr. President,

27:42.786 --> 27:45.073
| fear you are seriously misinfor--

27:45.205 --> 27:48.323
No, sir! You have been the one
who has misinformed me,

27:48.458 --> 27:50.950
and I don't think I need
to explain the ramifications

27:51.086 --> 27:54.795
of Americans being killed on American
soil by terrorists sponsored by Russia.

27:55.924 --> 27:57.710
You are upset.

27:58.093 --> 27:59.504
We all are.

27:59.636 --> 28:03.049
Many of us have friends on that plane.

28:05.559 --> 28:09.894
So we should all proceed with caution.

28:11.940 --> 28:13.851
There's a Russian proverb...

28:13.984 --> 28:17.568
[speaking Russian]

28:18.113 --> 28:21.151
"A cautious friend is a good friend."

28:21.617 --> 28:22.732
| prefer...

28:23.410 --> 28:25.993
[in Russian]

28:26.955 --> 28:28.457
My wife's family is Russian.

28:28.582 --> 28:30.823
Her grandparents didn't want her
dating a poor academic,

28:30.959 --> 28:34.122
so I learned their language
in an effort to win them over.

28:35.005 --> 28:36.746
Because I'm thorough.

28:37.341 --> 28:39.457
Every single person
that's hurt on that plane,

28:39.593 --> 28:41.960
let me explain
how thorough I will be.

28:42.095 --> 28:46.180
| will wake up every morning determined
to punish those who are responsible,

28:46.308 --> 28:47.514
and when your bosses start calling,

28:47.643 --> 28:50.476
trying to figure out why
we've severed diplomatic relations

28:50.604 --> 28:52.766
and the sanctions just keep mounting...

28:54.608 --> 28:57.441
two names will be used
in my explanation.

28:57.986 --> 28:59.602
[in Russian]

29:04.785 --> 29:06.116
That'll be all.

29:11.166 --> 29:13.032
What did you tell them?

29:13.627 --> 29:15.163
Playtime is over.

29:22.552 --> 29:24.168
[whirring]

29:26.306 --> 29:28.718
[clattering]

29:42.531 --> 29:44.943
[Hannah] Lloyd's computers weren't there.
Talk to me, Chuck.

29:45.075 --> 29:47.407
Lloyd bought those computers
for their processing power.

29:47.536 --> 29:50.028
He networks them,
he's got a supercomputer.

29:50.163 --> 29:51.745
All right, I'm listening.

29:51.873 --> 29:54.740
Well, that much active hardware
would leave an enormous heat signature.

29:54.876 --> 29:57.038
We're talking hundreds
of thousands of kilowatts.

29:57.671 --> 29:59.378
And... presto.

29:59.840 --> 30:01.126
Getting a power surge
where I shouldn't:

30:01.258 --> 30:02.589
an abandoned building.

30:02.718 --> 30:04.254
Sending the address now.

30:04.386 --> 30:05.842
[door creaks]

30:12.227 --> 30:15.219
[computer beeping]

30:30.078 --> 30:32.410
[computer beeping]

30:33.457 --> 30:34.947
He's crunching data.

30:38.420 --> 30:40.411
No, he crunched it.

30:40.881 --> 30:42.622
And he scrubbed
whatever he was working on.

30:48.263 --> 30:50.470
He's got a bunch of passports here;

30:50.932 --> 30:52.969
different names,
different nationalities.

30:53.101 --> 30:56.469
He's got about a dozen tickets here,
all for this morning...

30:57.939 --> 30:59.771
all for different airports.

30:59.900 --> 31:01.140
He's gone.

31:01.276 --> 31:03.358
| can confirm that Russia's
latest troop movements

31:03.487 --> 31:05.854
indicate a complete withdrawal
from the Ukrainian border,

31:05.989 --> 31:09.527
and our negotiators are finalizing
the details of the hijackers' surrender.

31:09.659 --> 31:11.320
Have their demands been met?

31:11.453 --> 31:14.286
No, but because of the direct involvement
of the President,

31:14.414 --> 31:16.155
diplomatic channels have opened.

31:16.291 --> 31:19.875
Passengers are disembarking now and
are being escorted to a security area.

31:20.003 --> 31:20.993
So this is a breakthrough.

31:21.129 --> 31:22.665
Uh, just to confirm,

31:22.798 --> 31:25.381
no evidence Patrick Lloyd was
involved in this, right?

31:25.509 --> 31:28.501
Right. Um, this hijacking
appears to have been

31:28.637 --> 31:31.345
strictly a regional dispute.
Thank you.

31:31.473 --> 31:33.635
[indistinct chatter]

31:36.520 --> 31:40.309
Uh, one more item, guys, if I may.

31:41.149 --> 31:42.184
Thank you.

31:42.317 --> 31:44.479
You know, if things have seemed
a bit crabby

31:44.611 --> 31:46.818
on this side of the podium,
I-I apologize.

31:47.322 --> 31:50.986
| understand that your job is to ask
questions and mine is to answer them.

31:51.118 --> 31:54.076
But if I can just offer
a little bit of context.

31:54.204 --> 31:56.866
This President has survived
an assassination attempt,

31:57.791 --> 31:59.998
the murder of his vice president,

32:00.127 --> 32:04.371
and an opposition who can only
seem to agree on the single proposition

32:04.506 --> 32:06.338
that he should be thwarted at every turn.

32:06.466 --> 32:11.131
And yet, the President has never wavered
in his belief in the American dream,

32:12.347 --> 32:15.965
or in the fundamental belief
in the goodness of the American people.

32:17.644 --> 32:19.351
Write about that.

32:21.022 --> 32:22.012
[whispers] Booyah.

32:25.152 --> 32:27.735
Mr. Grandy, thank you
very much for coming.

32:27.863 --> 32:29.604
| hope you haven't been waiting
too long.

32:29.739 --> 32:31.195
No. No, sir.

32:31.324 --> 32:32.280
Please.

32:32.409 --> 32:34.275
| wanted to thank you
in person for your work,

32:34.411 --> 32:37.779
and congratulate you on becoming
a National Medal for the Arts recipient.

32:37.914 --> 32:40.201
Thank you, sir, but I can't accept.

32:40.333 --> 32:41.619
I'm sorry?

32:41.751 --> 32:42.877
| can't accept.

32:43.003 --> 32:44.289
Perhaps you could elaborate.

32:44.421 --> 32:45.832
Well, it's a bad fit.

32:46.214 --> 32:50.003
| was just some name on a list
drawn up by a subordinate, right?

32:50.594 --> 32:53.052
But nobody actually checked
to see who I am.

32:53.597 --> 32:55.929
You probably haven't read
a word I've written.

32:56.057 --> 32:57.309
No, I've read all of them.

32:57.434 --> 32:58.924
"Winter's Chill," "The Painter,"

32:59.060 --> 33:00.596
the Berman Trilogy.

33:00.729 --> 33:02.561
T-then you know I'm not someone
you can honor.

33:03.023 --> 33:04.479
How is that?

33:04.608 --> 33:06.815
| abhor what you stand for.

33:06.943 --> 33:09.150
| think the establishment
IS cancerous,

33:09.279 --> 33:11.441
and I can't be bought off
by a trinket.

33:11.573 --> 33:14.941
-I'm counting on that.
-I-I don't-- I'm sorry, what?

33:15.076 --> 33:17.784
Government exists
simply as a means.

33:17.913 --> 33:20.621
It allows us to live, love, create.

33:20.749 --> 33:24.083
If you didn't exist,
there'd be no reason for me to.

33:25.045 --> 33:28.754
I... - I don't know
how to respond to that, sir.

33:29.591 --> 33:30.752
Yes, you do.

33:31.259 --> 33:32.374
Keep writing.

33:34.429 --> 33:37.091
I'm not asking you to stand down.

33:37.224 --> 33:39.090
I'm asking you to stand up.

33:39.893 --> 33:41.383
You think you can do that?

33:42.270 --> 33:43.305
| think so.

33:43.438 --> 33:44.644
Good.

33:45.148 --> 33:47.480
Good.
| really am a fan.

33:54.074 --> 33:56.532
Emily, we're going in there
with or without you.

33:56.660 --> 33:58.526
| just think Lyor needs
a little more time.

33:58.662 --> 34:00.448
To do what? This is a senior
staff assignment,

34:00.580 --> 34:02.036
someone we have to work
intimately with.

34:02.165 --> 34:03.872
He's temperamentally unfit.
He's not socialized.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.332
He tried to trade me
an egg salad sandwich for my pen.

34:06.461 --> 34:07.963
His egg salad sandwiches
are really good.

34:08.088 --> 34:09.168
-Em...
-Look, wait, guys.

34:09.297 --> 34:12.505
Lyor is here because we need
a direction, a battle plan,

34:12.634 --> 34:15.342
someone to help with our messaging,
and there is no one better.

34:15.469 --> 34:17.335
When you were coming up together,
that was probably true,

34:17.472 --> 34:19.713
but now he's a square peg
in a round hole. He doesn't fit.

34:19.849 --> 34:22.341
Would you rather be having
this conversation with the President

34:22.476 --> 34:23.808
before he starts or in two months?

34:35.489 --> 34:36.855
What's wrong?

34:37.951 --> 34:39.987
We need to talk to you about Lyor.

34:41.036 --> 34:42.652
Oh, good.

34:43.456 --> 34:45.197
Your timing's perfect.
Come with me.

34:48.878 --> 34:50.744
This was the book
| was talking about.

34:50.880 --> 34:54.009
Oh.
Oh, the cov... ah, yes.

34:54.676 --> 34:56.382
Oh, hey, gang.

34:56.511 --> 34:57.717
[book thunks]

34:57.846 --> 35:02.261
Ah, so... uh, I just told
the President.

35:02.392 --> 35:06.386
I've decided I want to work here
because I think I can help.

35:07.814 --> 35:09.020
Please.

35:09.149 --> 35:11.436
Seth, you keep using
the word "hijacking."

35:11.568 --> 35:14.856
That suggests a loss of control
and incompetence.

35:14.988 --> 35:16.899
The optimal phrase is just
"terrorist attack."

35:17.032 --> 35:18.238
It makes us look like victims, right?

35:18.366 --> 35:20.528
Victims are sympathetic.
People like them.

35:21.202 --> 35:22.283
O-okay.

35:22.412 --> 35:25.746
Aaron, you met the Ukrainian
ambassador in a hotel.

35:25.874 --> 35:28.741
Uh, Ukraine already has
an inferiority complex, right?

35:28.877 --> 35:32.370
Then you went and told them
that they can't set foot in the citadel.

35:32.756 --> 35:34.246
They're a proud people.

35:34.382 --> 35:35.884
Symbols matter to them.

35:36.551 --> 35:38.883
And once you offend them,
oh, God...

35:39.012 --> 35:40.047
- I didn't--
-And, Emily,

35:40.180 --> 35:43.423
you were worried about the optics of the
President meeting Elias Grandy, that

35:43.558 --> 35:45.799
-he would make the President look weak...
-Exactly.

35:45.935 --> 35:48.142
...but embracing a critic makes
the President look strong,

35:48.271 --> 35:50.478
and you want that embrace to be public.

35:50.607 --> 35:53.144
You want to tell the world
this man reaches out to everybody,

35:53.276 --> 35:54.892
even his fiercest critics.

35:55.028 --> 35:56.894
Because Tom Kirkman...

35:58.073 --> 35:59.234
is everyone's president.

35:59.366 --> 36:00.606
[laughs]

36:00.742 --> 36:02.073
So, what do you think?

36:03.578 --> 36:05.160
[scoffs]

36:05.288 --> 36:08.326
I-I think he would be, um, an asset.

36:08.458 --> 36:11.792
Yes. Uh, he'd be a great addition, sir.
You should bring him aboard.

36:11.920 --> 36:13.752
Good, 'cause I already have.

36:13.880 --> 36:16.793
| have to be honest, Em,
at first, I was a bit skeptical,

36:16.925 --> 36:18.962
but you're right--
he's on to something.

36:19.094 --> 36:22.758
Inspiration is fundamental to what
we're doing here in this building.

36:23.098 --> 36:24.463
Couldn't put it better, sir.

36:24.599 --> 36:27.307
Well, you're gonna have to try
if you want to get paid around here.

36:27.435 --> 36:28.687
-Welcome aboard.
-Thank you.

36:28.812 --> 36:29.973
[cellphone buzzes]

36:30.105 --> 36:33.143
Mr. President,
you're needed in command ops.

36:33.274 --> 36:35.231
There's been a development.

36:39.072 --> 36:41.313
-Ten-hut!
-Please, everybody sit.

36:41.449 --> 36:42.701
What have you got?

36:42.826 --> 36:44.362
Sir, this happened moments ago.

36:44.494 --> 36:46.110
[beeps]

36:48.665 --> 36:51.157
An oxygen canister that was
brought on for a passenger

36:51.292 --> 36:54.421
was accidentally ignited
by a spark from the tramway.

37:00.468 --> 37:01.674
Any fatalities?

37:01.803 --> 37:03.134
Just two.

37:03.263 --> 37:05.004
Passengers
had already deplaned,

37:05.140 --> 37:08.349
except for a doctor who was
ministering to a sick man.

37:26.035 --> 37:27.992
[indistinct conversations]

37:33.001 --> 37:35.538
Everyone, if I could just have
your attention, please.

37:36.671 --> 37:40.835
I-I just wanted to take a moment
and thank you for your hard work today.

37:41.509 --> 37:43.921
We managed to avoid
an international crisis,

37:44.053 --> 37:45.794
and we saved a lot of lives.

37:47.348 --> 37:48.759
But [, uh...

37:48.892 --> 37:51.008
| didn't get everyone home, though.

37:52.896 --> 37:56.139
As some of you might know already,
| had a friend on that plane--

37:58.485 --> 38:00.522
One of the two people
who were Killed.

38:02.530 --> 38:05.989
He dedicated his life
to helping other people.

38:07.535 --> 38:09.117
Not for fortune or fame,

38:09.245 --> 38:12.033
but... because whenever he saw pain,

38:12.165 --> 38:15.374
he would have to do whatever he could
to try and ease it.

38:17.086 --> 38:19.919
His focus and commitment to that ideal

38:20.715 --> 38:23.833
will be an inspiration to me
for the rest of my life.

38:26.179 --> 38:29.217
You have all dedicated
yourselves to public service,

38:30.266 --> 38:34.726
and you serve approximately
326 million Americans,

38:35.522 --> 38:39.561
most of whom
you'll never meet or ever know.

38:40.276 --> 38:43.189
It is imperative that we not become numb.

38:44.197 --> 38:45.938
The people that we serve, they...

38:46.950 --> 38:48.440
they have faces,

38:49.202 --> 38:51.819
families, hopes and dreams...

38:51.955 --> 38:53.741
[exhales]

38:54.582 --> 38:55.913
...and stories.

38:56.417 --> 38:58.499
And they are our fellow Americans,

38:58.628 --> 39:00.995
and by virtue of that bond alone,

39:01.130 --> 39:03.508
they are worthy of our sacrifice,

39:03.633 --> 39:05.544
our commitment, and our service.

39:09.389 --> 39:12.632
I'm talking as much to myself
as I am to any of you.

39:14.561 --> 39:15.767
I'm sorry, I...

39:17.397 --> 39:19.479
| came in here to thank you

39:19.607 --> 39:22.395
for your incredible work today, so...

39:22.986 --> 39:24.272
thank you.

39:24.404 --> 39:25.815
And good night.

39:26.614 --> 39:28.992
[indistinct conversations]

39:32.161 --> 39:33.572
[whispers] Booyah.

39:33.955 --> 39:35.116
[chuckles]

39:42.797 --> 39:43.787
Hey.

39:45.466 --> 39:46.922
You did your best.

39:48.428 --> 39:50.419
My best wasn't good enough.

39:51.306 --> 39:52.967
It was an accident.

39:53.433 --> 39:54.969
He was trying to help someone.

39:55.643 --> 39:57.975
Otherwise, he would have gotten
off the plane.

39:59.022 --> 40:01.263
- I need to call Rena.
- Ispoke with her,

40:01.858 --> 40:06.022
and she wanted you to know
that Russell understood.

40:07.655 --> 40:09.521
He was never mad at you.

40:15.330 --> 40:17.492
-[receiver clicks]
-Patch me through, please.

40:20.793 --> 40:22.659
Rena, it's Tom.
