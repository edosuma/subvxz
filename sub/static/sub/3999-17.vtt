WEBVTT

00:17.785 --> 00:18.784
(liquid bubbling)

00:18.786 --> 00:19.785
(timer dings)

00:19.787 --> 00:21.787
All right, clockwise, honey.

00:21.789 --> 00:22.988
Don't fight it.

00:22.990 --> 00:24.523
Let me make you.

00:24.525 --> 00:26.792
What... is that?

00:26.794 --> 00:29.161
This is the only thing us
Miller men know how to make.

00:29.163 --> 00:31.030
And we call it The Sauce.

00:31.032 --> 00:32.631
It stinks.
- It doesn't stink.

00:32.633 --> 00:34.466
Fawn is coming over
for a midnight fondue supper.

00:34.468 --> 00:36.468
There's no chocolate
or cheese on this earth

00:36.470 --> 00:39.138
that makes a cube of bread pop
like The Sauce.

00:39.140 --> 00:41.040
Your girlfriend's coming
over for the first time,

00:41.042 --> 00:43.375
and you asked
Nick to cook?

00:43.377 --> 00:45.477
True, normally food à la Nick
would be less appealing to me

00:45.479 --> 00:47.379
than licking the floor
of a beach bathroom.

00:47.381 --> 00:49.348
But I want Fawn
to have the best,

00:49.350 --> 00:51.717
and The Sauce is the best.

00:51.719 --> 00:54.319
Good for you-- when you said
"Fawn" and then "fondue,"

00:54.321 --> 00:56.155
I definitely thought you were
headed in the direction of--

00:56.157 --> 00:58.023
Step one: fondue.

00:58.025 --> 01:00.492
Step two: do Fawn.
That's not bad.

01:00.494 --> 01:02.361
Yeah, and I was like,
"Fondue is Fawn done."

01:02.363 --> 01:04.229
(snickers)
Th-These are all good.

01:04.231 --> 01:05.697
Hey, has anybody
heard from Cece?

01:05.699 --> 01:07.566
'Cause she hasn't
answered any of my texts,

01:07.568 --> 01:09.168
and I'm starting
to get worried.

01:09.170 --> 01:11.170
Jess is starting
to find your behavior...

01:11.172 --> 01:12.871
"suspicious."

01:12.873 --> 01:14.173
That's a police word.

01:14.175 --> 01:15.407
It's not a police word, Winston.

01:15.409 --> 01:16.742
It's a very common word.

01:16.744 --> 01:19.411
And you know
why I'm keeping my distance.

01:19.413 --> 01:20.546
I like Schmidt.

01:20.548 --> 01:21.713
For the second time!

01:21.715 --> 01:23.549
I know how many times.

01:23.551 --> 01:24.716
Ah. Ah.

01:24.718 --> 01:26.018
If you could see
my face right now,

01:26.020 --> 01:27.853
I'm smiling,
and I'm saying, "Ah."

01:27.855 --> 01:29.588
And if Jess finds out, she's
gonna want to get involved,

01:29.590 --> 01:31.023
and I don't want her involved

01:31.025 --> 01:32.558
because there's nothing
that she can do.

01:32.560 --> 01:34.526
Look, if you act suspicious,

01:34.528 --> 01:35.928
then she's gonna be suspicious,
all right?

01:35.930 --> 01:37.429
Look, don't slink
your head in the dumps.

01:37.431 --> 01:38.764
You got to raise your hand
with the sunshine

01:38.766 --> 01:40.699
wh-where people walk, you know?

01:40.701 --> 01:42.367
Because that's what
the whole point of the...

01:42.369 --> 01:44.369
when the... (stammers)
if you can lead 'em to water,

01:44.371 --> 01:46.238
but you can't make
a sound, right?

01:46.240 --> 01:47.406
Look, just call her.

01:47.408 --> 01:48.707
Fine, okay, I'll call her.

01:48.709 --> 01:51.243
But... and listen to me,

01:51.245 --> 01:54.246
she cannot find out.

01:54.248 --> 01:55.414
Under no circumstance.

01:55.416 --> 01:56.615
Okay, baby.

01:56.617 --> 01:58.717
Look, your secret is safe
with me.

01:58.719 --> 02:00.385
That being said,

02:00.387 --> 02:02.788
I am not a smooth man.
Yeah, I get that.

02:02.790 --> 02:05.424
Did I do something
to piss Cece off?

02:05.426 --> 02:07.726
Oh, Schmidt, you have
something on your pants.

02:07.728 --> 02:08.927
Ah! It's a spider!
- (shrieks)

02:08.929 --> 02:10.963
Jess, why did you do that?

02:10.965 --> 02:13.065
You know how he gets--
he turns into

02:13.067 --> 02:14.900
a cartoon elephant
of yesteryear

02:14.902 --> 02:16.101
who just saw a mouse.

02:16.103 --> 02:17.436
Which is offensive
in present day

02:17.438 --> 02:18.770
'cause it seems like
a gay stereotype

02:18.772 --> 02:19.972
they tried to sneak by us.

02:19.974 --> 02:21.306
(imitates elephant trumpeting)

02:21.308 --> 02:22.908
(with lisp):
"Where's my balance ball?

02:22.910 --> 02:25.744
There's a mouse loose
in the house."

02:25.746 --> 02:27.646
SCHMIDT: Where is it?
We've got to hunt it down.

02:27.648 --> 02:29.448
We got to have
a spiderhunt.
We're not having one of those.

02:29.450 --> 02:31.283
No, dude, no more spiderhunts.
Guys, they're all over me!

02:31.285 --> 02:33.752
This is childish, and
you need to get over it.

02:33.754 --> 02:35.420
Jess, would you please?
You know this fear comes

02:35.422 --> 02:37.122
from a very real
place-- 1999.

02:37.124 --> 02:39.124
<i>American Pie</i> was
sweeping the nation.

02:39.126 --> 02:40.926
And everybody was
doing it with pies.

02:40.928 --> 02:43.495
I just happened to accidentally
fall asleep right afterwards.

02:43.497 --> 02:45.464
And when I awoke,

02:45.466 --> 02:47.933
the dried
apple filling was...

02:47.935 --> 02:49.501
it just had attracted
so many spiders,

02:49.503 --> 02:51.103
and they were
all over it, and I...

02:51.105 --> 02:53.272
Okay, everyone was
doing it with pies?

02:53.274 --> 02:55.140
Well, Y2K was an uncertain time.

02:55.142 --> 02:57.609
I don't know "everyone," Jess.
I might have dabbled.

02:57.611 --> 02:59.645
Fawn can't see me
like this.
- Fawn won't care.

02:59.647 --> 03:02.181
Jess, I'm embarrassed...
for her to see me in this state.
You're fine...

03:02.183 --> 03:03.949
It's embarrassing--
just a little spider!
- You're fine.

03:03.951 --> 03:05.651
And there it is!
I just saw it!

03:05.653 --> 03:07.352
Get off the table.
We'll do the spiderhunt.

03:07.354 --> 03:09.621
Fawn can't see
you like this.
- There it is!

03:09.623 --> 03:11.690
It's right there--
it's licking it's lips.

03:19.133 --> 03:20.699
So I'm finally e-mailing
that girl, May.
- Nice.

03:20.701 --> 03:22.501
Here's what
I got so far.
- Mm-hmm.

03:22.503 --> 03:24.169
"Dear May.

03:24.171 --> 03:25.804
Lay down on me."

03:25.806 --> 03:27.172
Well, th-then what?

03:27.174 --> 03:28.640
You met this woman weeks ago--
I can't believe

03:28.642 --> 03:30.209
you haven't e-mailed her.
Just text her.

03:30.211 --> 03:32.144
COACH: If I had her number,
I would text her.

03:32.146 --> 03:33.478
She gave me her e-mail.

03:33.480 --> 03:35.013
And now I have to
write how I feel.

03:35.015 --> 03:37.316
Which is weird,
it's like...

03:37.318 --> 03:39.484
I-I like her. Much.

03:39.486 --> 03:40.552
You like her much?

03:40.554 --> 03:41.987
All right.

03:41.989 --> 03:44.056
"Girl, it's warm today.

03:44.058 --> 03:45.691
"Yesterday
was warm, too.

03:45.693 --> 03:47.659
Yeah."

03:47.661 --> 03:49.161
Yeah, I'm gonna
write, "Yeah."

03:49.163 --> 03:50.362
You're happy about this?

03:50.364 --> 03:51.830
Damn it, no, it
doesn't feel right.

03:51.832 --> 03:53.332
Yeah, just hold it down,
hold it down.

03:53.334 --> 03:54.733
Okay, you guys
know the drill.

03:54.735 --> 03:57.502
We split up into teams,
and we hunt this spider.

03:57.504 --> 03:59.838
Why can't we just call
an exterminator?
- Yes.

03:59.840 --> 04:01.006
They've all blocked
Schmidt's calls

04:01.008 --> 04:02.174
since the dandelion incident.

04:02.176 --> 04:04.176
It moved like
a spider, Nick!

04:04.178 --> 04:05.510
(cell phone ringing)

04:05.512 --> 04:07.246
(gasps)

04:07.248 --> 04:08.714
I don't know a Cece.

04:08.716 --> 04:11.250
(chuckles) Yeah, I do.
How the hell are you?

04:11.252 --> 04:13.852
Jess, please, hurry
up, we're on a hunt!

04:13.854 --> 04:15.687
It could be right
above our heads right now.

04:15.689 --> 04:18.257
Hanging from its butt-rope.

04:18.259 --> 04:19.858
Come over.

04:19.860 --> 04:21.760
I can't.
Why not?

04:21.762 --> 04:23.395
Did I do something?

04:23.397 --> 04:25.397
Are we in another purse thing
that I don't know about?

04:25.399 --> 04:27.866
No, no, Jess,
of course it's not you.

04:27.868 --> 04:29.434
It would just be...

04:32.373 --> 04:34.273
...an honor.

04:34.275 --> 04:36.074
I'll be right there.

04:36.076 --> 04:38.944
Great, wear shoes that you don't
mind getting spider guts on.

04:38.946 --> 04:40.412
Bye.

04:40.414 --> 04:42.381
So...

04:42.383 --> 04:43.548
what's going
on with Cece?

04:43.550 --> 04:44.916
Well, I had to beg her
like a nerd,

04:44.918 --> 04:46.418
but she's finally
coming over.

04:46.420 --> 04:47.719
Oh, she's coming over?
- Yeah.

04:47.721 --> 04:49.554
Good, man.
Took a lot of cajoling.

04:49.556 --> 04:51.423
That's cool.
Normally, it's like,
she'll come over all the time.

04:51.425 --> 04:52.758
But now it's diff...
I don't know why

04:52.760 --> 04:54.593
that would be
the case at all,

04:54.595 --> 04:56.595
but that's cool-- I respect the
decision for her to come over.

04:56.597 --> 04:58.563
Why are you acting weird?

04:58.565 --> 05:00.699
I'm acting weird?

05:01.602 --> 05:03.568
Mm.
- Do you know something?

05:03.570 --> 05:04.770
Do...?

05:04.772 --> 05:06.738
You... I'm not
a smooth man.

05:06.740 --> 05:07.739
Is she mad at someone?

05:07.741 --> 05:09.308
Ah... no.

05:09.310 --> 05:10.475
No.

05:10.477 --> 05:12.244
No, she's not
mad at anyone.

05:12.246 --> 05:13.412
It's the opposite.

05:13.414 --> 05:14.746
Mm.

05:14.748 --> 05:16.748
It's the opposite?
- That's not
what I said.

05:16.750 --> 05:19.751
You said, "No, no,
she's not mad at anyone.

05:19.753 --> 05:21.286
It's the opposite."

05:21.288 --> 05:23.655
I said, "Whoa, whoa.

05:23.657 --> 05:25.290
"Cheese is bad e'ryone.

05:25.292 --> 05:27.259
Let's stop and spit."

05:27.261 --> 05:29.928
The opposite of mad is...

05:29.930 --> 05:31.630
(gasps)
Does she like someone?

05:31.632 --> 05:33.332
What would make you
assume that would be...?

05:34.468 --> 05:35.767
I can hear it.

05:35.769 --> 05:37.502
I can hear it
building its house.

05:37.504 --> 05:39.271
Building its sticky,
deadly house

05:39.273 --> 05:40.639
that you can never leave.

05:40.641 --> 05:42.474
Building it.

05:42.476 --> 05:44.710
With its ass.

05:52.152 --> 05:53.952
We're breaking up
into two-person teams.
Cece.

05:53.954 --> 05:56.455
Each team has one Smusher
and one Jar-Man.

05:56.457 --> 05:58.457
Nick, I'm gonna make you a
Smusher since you have to stir.

05:58.459 --> 05:59.958
Hey, am I stirring right now?

05:59.960 --> 06:02.694
Or is my arm still
and the world is stirring?

06:02.696 --> 06:04.529
Coach, you're a Jar-Man.

06:04.531 --> 06:06.631
Mm.
- You're with Schmidt.

06:06.633 --> 06:09.968
Cece, with your delicate little
hands, you're a born Jar-Man.

06:09.970 --> 06:12.504
Okay.
Which means I need to pair
you up with a Smusher.

06:12.506 --> 06:13.972
I smush.
That'd be me.

06:13.974 --> 06:15.974
Smusher for life.
- You're such
a Jar-Man.

06:15.976 --> 06:18.543
You don't even know
you're a Jar-Man, Jar-Man.

06:18.545 --> 06:20.379
Yeah, you are.
You're a born J-man.
Come on, Winston.

06:20.381 --> 06:22.314
Uh, Cece.
- Yeah.

06:22.316 --> 06:24.516
Before we get started,
you want to have a quick

06:24.518 --> 06:25.884
Jar-Man strategy
session?

06:25.886 --> 06:27.986
A little Jar-Jar
strat sesh?

06:27.988 --> 06:29.554
Are you winking or farting?

06:29.556 --> 06:32.023
The only strategy is: find
the spider, kill the spider,

06:32.025 --> 06:33.825
mount the spider's head
on top of the roof

06:33.827 --> 06:35.360
so all the other
spiders know.

06:35.362 --> 06:37.496
All right. And spiderhunt!

06:37.498 --> 06:38.563
Spiderhunt!
- Spiderhunt!

06:38.565 --> 06:39.765
You find that thing...

06:41.835 --> 06:44.669
...you-you make sure that
it's done.
- That's extreme.
That's...

06:44.671 --> 06:46.238
Okay.

06:49.042 --> 06:51.543
Hey, what do you think Jess
and Cece are talking about?

06:51.545 --> 06:55.013
Uh, probably that stupid
movie theater popcorn machine

06:55.015 --> 06:57.015
that Cece wants me
to get for the bar.

06:57.017 --> 06:58.417
She keeps haranguing me
about it.

06:58.419 --> 07:00.552
"Popcorn machine,
popcorn machine."

07:00.554 --> 07:01.920
Look, I don't know what void

07:01.922 --> 07:03.522
Cece's trying to fill
in her life...

07:03.524 --> 07:05.056
I don't know, either.
Why would I know?

07:05.058 --> 07:06.425
I don't know what void
she's trying to fill.

07:06.427 --> 07:08.560
It's all she wants
to talk about.
- Oh.

07:08.562 --> 07:10.362
Stupid movie theater
popcorn machine.

07:10.364 --> 07:12.697
I'm like, "Shut up, dude."
(timer dings)

07:12.699 --> 07:14.433
You put bologna
in your Bolognese?

07:14.435 --> 07:15.934
Where else would
it get its name?

07:15.936 --> 07:18.770
Trick question-- it gets it
from the mayonnaise.

07:21.942 --> 07:24.176
(chuckling):
Yeah, yeah.

07:26.213 --> 07:28.380
You got it.

07:28.382 --> 07:31.917
Do you think a good subject
line is "The Inside of You"?

07:31.919 --> 07:33.385
Hey, you know,
I bet I could spot this spider

07:33.387 --> 07:34.453
a lot better
if I was on your shoulders.

07:34.455 --> 07:35.554
Do not ask me again

07:35.556 --> 07:36.588
to get on my shoulders.

07:36.590 --> 07:37.889
That's
a once-a-year thing,

07:37.891 --> 07:39.291
and you already used it
on Halloween,

07:39.293 --> 07:41.059
when we were ten-foot-tall
Ralph Macchio.

07:41.061 --> 07:43.295
(elevator bell dings)

07:45.065 --> 07:48.066
SCHMIDT:
Ow! Damn it!

07:48.068 --> 07:49.734
That was cool.

07:49.736 --> 07:51.269
I didn't like that.
I could feel

07:51.271 --> 07:52.571
your genitals
on the back of my neck

07:52.573 --> 07:53.905
like an airplane pillow.

07:53.907 --> 07:54.973
Okay, you know what?
How about this?

07:54.975 --> 07:56.308
I'm not sure why he did it

07:56.310 --> 07:57.609
but I sure am glad
that God rearranged

07:57.611 --> 07:59.244
the letters in "yam" to...

07:59.246 --> 08:01.413
create something even sweeter.

08:01.415 --> 08:03.281
What?
May.

08:03.283 --> 08:05.817
Oh, May, yeah.
Yeah, all right.

08:05.819 --> 08:08.253
Keep going, keep going.

08:08.255 --> 08:10.489
Oh, dear God.

08:10.491 --> 08:12.257
It's left the web to feed.

08:12.259 --> 08:13.792
All right, I'll put that.

08:13.794 --> 08:15.427
Seems like a weird thing to say.

08:15.429 --> 08:17.429
CECE: Lots of bars
have popcorn machines.

08:17.431 --> 08:19.097
I really think that
people would dig it.

08:19.099 --> 08:20.332
They're not that expensive,

08:20.334 --> 08:22.300
and everybody loves
fresh popcorn.

08:22.302 --> 08:24.035
Do you like somebody
in the loft?

08:24.938 --> 08:26.605
Winston.

08:26.607 --> 08:29.274
Okay, what did
he tell you?

08:29.276 --> 08:30.775
He told me you like someone
but he won't name names.

08:30.777 --> 08:32.277
Is it Schmidt?
Do you like Schmidt again?

08:32.279 --> 08:33.478
No. No, no, no, no, no, no,

08:33.480 --> 08:34.479
no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

08:34.481 --> 08:36.481
Absolutely not. No.

08:36.483 --> 08:37.949
Who is it then? Who?

08:37.951 --> 08:40.118
I want to tell you.
I want to tell you so,

08:40.120 --> 08:41.620
like, so badly--
you know me--

08:41.622 --> 08:43.288
I want to tell you
so bad, I just, um,

08:43.290 --> 08:44.856
I'm very sorry, but I can't.

08:44.858 --> 08:46.625
Right, right, right, right,
you can't tell anybody,

08:46.627 --> 08:48.660
except freaking Winston!

08:48.662 --> 08:50.362
That slow puzzler!

08:50.364 --> 08:52.464
I know.
I'm lower down on the food chain

08:52.466 --> 08:53.832
than Officer Cat Fancy?!
No!

08:53.834 --> 08:55.800
No. No, no, no, no.
It's just I know

08:55.802 --> 08:57.836
that you would do
anything to help me,

08:57.838 --> 08:59.671
and in this situation,

08:59.673 --> 09:01.840
you know, there's just
nothing to be done.

09:01.842 --> 09:03.308
And we both know that

09:03.310 --> 09:04.809
you would just want
to get involved.

09:04.811 --> 09:06.811
Well, I can stay uninvolved.

09:06.813 --> 09:09.414
I want to tell you, but I can't.
I just can't.

09:11.351 --> 09:13.818
Okay. That's fine.
- Okay.

09:13.820 --> 09:16.621
That's cool, that's cool.
New teams!

09:21.328 --> 09:23.228
You have to tell me
who she likes.

09:23.230 --> 09:24.996
There are no secrets
between Jar-Man and Smusher.

09:24.998 --> 09:26.331
Please.

09:26.333 --> 09:28.567
She's my best friend.
You have to tell me.

09:28.569 --> 09:30.001
Okay.

09:30.003 --> 09:32.404
Look, Jess...

09:32.406 --> 09:34.539
she likes me.

09:34.541 --> 09:36.942
It's me she wants.

09:40.747 --> 09:42.948
(both laughing)

09:44.251 --> 09:45.550
Not even for a second.

09:45.552 --> 09:47.018
I thought I was convincing.
- Yeah.

09:47.020 --> 09:49.354
I need you to close
your eyes and taste it.

09:49.356 --> 09:51.089
Okay.

09:53.427 --> 09:55.527
Oh...

09:55.529 --> 09:57.429
Oh, Nick.

09:57.431 --> 09:59.197
It's legit terrible.

09:59.199 --> 10:02.534
Well, you taste for texture
not taste, you big old...

10:02.536 --> 10:04.269
Not really what I was
looking for at this stage.

10:04.271 --> 10:06.638
Definitely affects
my confidence.

10:11.078 --> 10:12.110
(gasps)

10:12.112 --> 10:14.212
Wait. Wait!

10:14.214 --> 10:16.915
The only person that Cece
could like that she wouldn't

10:16.917 --> 10:18.416
want to tell me about...

10:18.418 --> 10:20.352
is Nick.

10:21.388 --> 10:23.054
Uh...

10:23.056 --> 10:25.890
Does Cece like Nick?

10:25.892 --> 10:26.891
Does Cece like...?

10:26.893 --> 10:28.193
JESS:
Oh, my...

10:29.262 --> 10:31.463
No...

10:31.465 --> 10:33.598
you guessed it.

10:33.600 --> 10:36.001
How you did that?

10:40.107 --> 10:43.074
Oh, my God. My ex-boyfriend
and my best friend?

10:43.076 --> 10:44.075
(groans)

10:44.077 --> 10:45.777
I feel like Brenda

10:45.779 --> 10:47.646
when Kelly dated Dylan!

10:47.648 --> 10:49.481
Or the other way around.

10:49.483 --> 10:51.249
Now, I know those
are the characters

10:51.251 --> 10:52.784
from the original<i> 90210.</i>

10:52.786 --> 10:54.919
But that's about my ceiling.
Dylan-- was his nickname

10:54.921 --> 10:56.454
the Peach Pit?
'Cause I remember...

10:56.456 --> 10:58.089
I remember that being
a whole thing.

10:58.091 --> 10:59.758
I'm sorry,
I'm a little wound up.

10:59.760 --> 11:01.426
You should be wound up
because the Peach Pit used

11:01.428 --> 11:03.762
to be yours, but now
Brenda want a slice.

11:03.764 --> 11:05.263
Everybody trying to get
a slice of that Peach Pit.

11:05.265 --> 11:06.431
You have every right
to be mad,

11:06.433 --> 11:08.099
Jess, but just do it quietly.

11:08.101 --> 11:10.335
You know, just do it on
the low, do it in here.

11:10.337 --> 11:13.271
30 seconds, and you haven't
brought up the popcorn machine.

11:13.273 --> 11:15.774
Yeah, well, I guess
I'm just gonna have to drop it.

11:15.776 --> 11:17.842
You know, even Jess didn't
want to hear about it,

11:17.844 --> 11:20.311
and she'll listen to Schmidt
discussing Andy Cohen

11:20.313 --> 11:22.514
discussing Bethenny
discussing NeNe.

11:22.516 --> 11:24.616
Well, great, I'm glad
that's behind us.

11:24.618 --> 11:26.151
Yeah.

11:26.153 --> 11:28.620
Now let's never speak of
popcorn machines again.

11:28.622 --> 11:30.455
Cece and Nick?

11:30.457 --> 11:32.223
Cece likes Nick?

11:33.293 --> 11:35.126
Cece likes Nick?

11:35.128 --> 11:36.628
I mean,
I guess I understand it

11:36.630 --> 11:38.630
'cause they're
at the bar together,

11:38.632 --> 11:40.131
and once you start
sharing tips,

11:40.133 --> 11:41.633
where does the sharing end?
Look...

11:41.635 --> 11:43.468
Jess, it's not
that big of a deal.

11:43.470 --> 11:45.970
Because we all just cats and
dogs at the end of the day.

11:45.972 --> 11:48.306
What about Schmidt?
Schmidt's Nick's best friend,

11:48.308 --> 11:50.642
and Schmidt and Cece
have a history.

11:50.644 --> 11:52.477
Look at the memory on you.

11:52.479 --> 11:54.345
I'm gonna have to help
Schmidt through this.
No, no, no, no, no.

11:54.347 --> 11:56.347
Look, Jess, you can't talk to
Schmidt about Cece liking Nick.

11:56.349 --> 11:58.483
Come on.
- No, you're right.
I have to talk to Cece first.

11:58.485 --> 12:00.652
Right, you got to talk to Ce...
No, wait, no. No, no, no, no,

12:00.654 --> 12:03.154
no, no, no.
Jess, you can't talk to Cece

12:03.156 --> 12:06.157
because Cece,
you know, and Nick,

12:06.159 --> 12:08.827
they just won't work.
'Cause I was talking to Nick.

12:08.829 --> 12:11.663
He said, "Winston." I was like,
"What's up, Nick?" He said...

12:11.665 --> 12:13.531
What?

12:13.533 --> 12:14.866
He said she ugly.

12:14.868 --> 12:17.168
He said what?!

12:17.170 --> 12:19.671
He said she look like
a dang ol' meatball with hair.

12:19.673 --> 12:20.839
New teams!

12:20.841 --> 12:22.006
JESS:
<i>You know who's great?</i>

12:22.008 --> 12:23.908
Cece.
- One of our finest.

12:23.910 --> 12:25.310
Lovely woman.

12:27.581 --> 12:29.914
And she has so much to offer.

12:31.585 --> 12:33.218
Is that what this is about?

12:33.220 --> 12:35.186
She sends you
to sell me on it?

12:35.188 --> 12:38.523
No, Nick. She doesn't know
I'm talking to you at all. Wait.

12:38.525 --> 12:40.525
You guys have talked about it?

12:40.527 --> 12:41.860
All the time.

12:41.862 --> 12:42.927
But I thought

12:42.929 --> 12:44.896
she and I had come
to a decision.

12:44.898 --> 12:47.432
Which is?
It's not happening.

12:47.434 --> 12:50.201
Well, why not?
'Cause I'm not interested.

12:50.203 --> 12:51.603
And I know it's not cool
to say, but...

12:51.605 --> 12:54.873
I don't like the way
it would look.

12:54.875 --> 12:56.541
People are gonna say
what they're gonna say.

12:56.543 --> 12:59.244
They're not reasons
not to go through with it.

12:59.246 --> 13:01.379
Fine. You want to know
my biggest concern?

13:01.381 --> 13:03.848
My biggest concern
is the smell.

13:04.951 --> 13:07.051
The smell?

13:07.053 --> 13:08.219
The smell of it.

13:08.221 --> 13:09.921
Yeah, and it's not
Cece's fault.

13:09.923 --> 13:13.558
I mean, they all smell.
I've told her that.

13:13.560 --> 13:15.226
You told Cece
you think all women...

13:15.228 --> 13:17.262
Don't make this
a feminist thing...

13:17.264 --> 13:19.063
It... I'm not making
it a feminist thing.

13:19.065 --> 13:21.733
How? They smell terrible.
It's common knowledge.

13:21.735 --> 13:23.067
I thought your biggest
concern would be

13:23.069 --> 13:24.736
how it affected
the people around you.

13:24.738 --> 13:26.771
I mean, sure, a bunch of
old drunks will grab at it...

13:26.773 --> 13:28.907
But if your biggest
concern is the smell,

13:28.909 --> 13:30.909
I'm sure that's
highly manageable.

13:30.911 --> 13:33.478
Yeah, I guess there's, like,
special solvents and soaps.

13:33.480 --> 13:36.447
I-I haven't read up on it
that much.

13:36.449 --> 13:40.084
You know, but you got to really
get in there and scrub it out.

13:40.086 --> 13:42.253
It's disgusting.

13:42.255 --> 13:46.591
You know, 'cause of the daily
wear and tear and... oil

13:46.593 --> 13:49.427
and grease just cooking
in there.

13:49.429 --> 13:53.097
It's enough to make
a man barf thinking about it.

13:53.099 --> 13:55.133
I mean, they get really hot.

13:55.135 --> 13:56.801
I know what
temperature it gets.

13:56.803 --> 13:58.436
But if I'm being honest,
you know--

13:58.438 --> 14:00.638
and I haven't talked to her
about this-- but...

14:00.640 --> 14:03.107
I do have good memories
associated with the smell.

14:03.109 --> 14:06.945
Ball games, the circus,
hanging with my dad.

14:06.947 --> 14:09.147
Listen here, you idiot.
I've known Cece

14:09.149 --> 14:10.949
a very long time,
and I can promise you

14:10.951 --> 14:12.984
the smell will not be a problem.
That's really easy

14:12.986 --> 14:14.786
for you to say 'cause you're not
the one who's gonna have

14:14.788 --> 14:16.120
to remind her
to clean it all the time.

14:16.122 --> 14:18.022
I promise you,

14:18.024 --> 14:19.958
if it becomes a problem,

14:19.960 --> 14:22.794
I will remind her.
- Well,

14:22.796 --> 14:25.997
if you remind her
and she doesn't do it,

14:25.999 --> 14:29.634
I don't want you sneaking around
and cleaning it yourself.

14:29.636 --> 14:31.336
(scoffs)
Nick.

14:31.338 --> 14:34.305
I'm a good friend, but I am
not that good of a friend.

14:34.307 --> 14:35.673
"...that a dream house
is a house,

14:35.675 --> 14:37.141
but a dreamboat
is a person."

14:37.143 --> 14:39.344
I mean, it does
speak to the soul.

14:39.346 --> 14:42.647
Hey, what are these?
I've always wondered.

14:42.649 --> 14:44.983
Those are grapes.
- Uh, they're
our glass grapes, bro.

14:44.985 --> 14:46.985
Grapes?
- Brings the whole,
like, room together.

14:46.987 --> 14:48.820
What the hell they
doing in the loft?

14:48.822 --> 14:51.823
Cece, um, do ladies have loins?

14:51.825 --> 14:54.559
You know, it's like I've never
looked around this house before.

14:54.561 --> 14:56.995
Skimboards, a boxing glove.

14:56.997 --> 14:59.030
Who in this loft has been
to a single Coachella,

14:59.032 --> 15:00.531
let alone six of them?

15:00.533 --> 15:02.533
Don't tell Cece
that we talked.

15:02.535 --> 15:04.402
She doesn't want me
getting involved.

15:04.404 --> 15:06.037
Of course she does,
she just didn't think

15:06.039 --> 15:07.672
you were
into the idea, okay?

15:07.674 --> 15:09.274
She really values
your opinion.

15:13.013 --> 15:14.712
What if you
guys had a r...

15:14.714 --> 15:16.681
a r-real talk?

15:16.683 --> 15:19.183
You know, outside
of the bar.

15:19.185 --> 15:20.685
All right.

15:20.687 --> 15:23.187
We'll talk, just the two
of us, outside the bar.

15:23.189 --> 15:24.255
I'm proud of you, Nick.

15:24.257 --> 15:26.357
Just make sure
she makes her case

15:26.359 --> 15:28.259
about facts and figures.

15:28.261 --> 15:29.928
And no more of this,
"Come on, Nick,

15:29.930 --> 15:31.429
it tastes so yummy" crap.

15:31.431 --> 15:32.997
New teams!

15:35.268 --> 15:39.404
¶ I want to do something freaky
to you... ¶

15:39.406 --> 15:41.439
¶ ¶
No one can resist

15:41.441 --> 15:43.541
my "Get Frisky" playlist, guys.

15:43.543 --> 15:45.944
Just give in.

15:45.946 --> 15:46.911
Give in.

15:46.913 --> 15:48.212
I support it.

15:48.214 --> 15:51.382
"To whom it may concern."

15:51.384 --> 15:53.084
That's good.
I like that.

15:53.086 --> 15:55.887
Wait a minute, is your e-mail
address owwMeSoErnie@coolidge?

15:55.889 --> 15:57.722
Still?
Yeah, man. Picked it in college.

15:57.724 --> 16:00.792
It's just gonna follow me from
job to job, ISP to ISP.

16:00.794 --> 16:02.794
We've been everywhere
together, brotha.

16:02.796 --> 16:04.629
Never done .org or a .gov.
- Oh.

16:04.631 --> 16:06.230
I would never do that.
- Right.

16:06.232 --> 16:07.298
But every other damn domain.

16:07.300 --> 16:09.100
You can't e-mail a girl like May

16:09.102 --> 16:11.970
from an e-mail address like
owwMeSoErnie.

16:11.972 --> 16:14.906
Although, you did got a job
at a school, so what do I know?

16:14.908 --> 16:18.309
I must really like
this girl, huh?

16:18.311 --> 16:20.311
Okay, it says here,

16:20.313 --> 16:22.947
we need "a murder
of peppercorn," and a...

16:22.949 --> 16:25.316
and "some of that flat
Jew bread"?

16:25.318 --> 16:28.753
Miller family!

16:28.755 --> 16:30.321
Murder is
over there.

16:32.425 --> 16:34.158
(gasps)

16:34.160 --> 16:36.594
¶ ¶
It could be something
really beautiful,

16:36.596 --> 16:38.596
and you-you won't know
unless you try.

16:38.598 --> 16:40.598
Okay! Jess!

16:40.600 --> 16:42.667
You don't have to
trap me in your room.

16:42.669 --> 16:46.771
We will, on a trial basis,
rent a popcorn machine.

16:46.773 --> 16:48.806
Okay?

16:48.808 --> 16:51.109
(sniffing)

16:51.111 --> 16:53.511
Something's wrong
with my Sauce.

16:53.513 --> 16:54.779
My Sauce!

16:54.781 --> 16:56.981
Hey.

16:56.983 --> 16:58.016
Hey.

16:58.018 --> 17:00.451
You...?
- I...

17:00.453 --> 17:01.352
With him?

17:01.354 --> 17:03.454
¶ Good times! ¶

17:03.456 --> 17:05.456
Winston.

17:05.458 --> 17:07.525
Wh-Where'd it go?

17:08.461 --> 17:09.794
How long has this been
unstirred?!

17:09.796 --> 17:11.462
40 seconds. 45 tops.

17:11.464 --> 17:12.764
Is it 40 or 45?

17:16.970 --> 17:18.202
Spider!
(yelling)

17:18.204 --> 17:20.805
Schmidt! Schmidt!
- Whoa!

17:20.807 --> 17:22.473
Come on, man!
- No! Aah!

17:22.475 --> 17:23.808
(yelling)
- Hey! Hey!

17:23.810 --> 17:25.376
Hey, it's gone.
- Get him!

17:25.378 --> 17:26.978
It's gone. It's gone. It's gone.
It can't hurt you.

17:26.980 --> 17:28.312
It can't hurt you.
Where is... where is the body?!

17:28.314 --> 17:30.148
He was headed straight
for The Sauce!

17:30.150 --> 17:31.983
Can you imagine how powerful
that spider would've become

17:31.985 --> 17:33.584
had he entered my Sauce?

17:34.988 --> 17:36.888
Did I break it?
You sent all 15 drafts

17:36.890 --> 17:38.656
of my e-mail to May.

17:38.658 --> 17:40.725
She's gonna think I'm crazy.

17:40.727 --> 17:41.993
WINSTON:
Way I see it,

17:41.995 --> 17:43.661
we got two options.
- (sighs)

17:43.663 --> 17:45.496
All right, well, what are
the two options, man?

17:45.498 --> 17:47.365
I mean, you know, just, you
got to just dive in, you know?

17:47.367 --> 17:49.734
No, you don't have any options.
I don't have any options.

17:49.736 --> 17:51.736
Sometimes you don't
have to talk.
I'm really sorry, Coach.

17:51.738 --> 17:53.404
I-I'll make it up to you.

17:53.406 --> 17:56.340
But the good news is,
is we got that spider, huh?

17:56.342 --> 17:58.743
Don't have to worry
about that thing anymore.

18:00.713 --> 18:03.848
What? What are you guys trying
to tell me?

18:03.850 --> 18:05.716
So, it is Schmidt?

18:05.718 --> 18:08.753
Yeah.

18:13.726 --> 18:16.727
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you, but...
No, it's okay. It's okay.

18:16.729 --> 18:18.362
Look, I promise
I won't tell him.

18:18.364 --> 18:19.764
Nobody's gonna tell him.
- Okay.

18:19.766 --> 18:21.265
NICK:
Hey, somebody tell him.

18:21.267 --> 18:23.201
You tell him, but easy.

18:23.203 --> 18:24.869
Tell him.
COACH: I don't want to tell
him, dude. You tell him.

18:24.871 --> 18:26.204
We're all his best
friends. Tell him.

18:26.206 --> 18:27.438
I think I'm pretty good
with it now.

18:27.440 --> 18:28.739
Hey, Schmidt, I...

18:28.741 --> 18:29.941
I mean, spiders and all.
NICK: Tell him!

18:29.943 --> 18:31.209
WINSTON:
I don't want to tell him.

18:31.211 --> 18:32.110
NICK:
Somebody just tell him!

18:32.112 --> 18:34.112
Guys, just tell me.

18:34.114 --> 18:36.080
You're being so
dramatic right now.
You have a spider on your face.

18:36.082 --> 18:37.615
What are you talking about?

18:41.054 --> 18:44.489
(loud, high-pitched screaming)

18:47.727 --> 18:49.427
SCHMIDT (high-pitched scream):
<i>I touched it!</i>

18:49.429 --> 18:50.895
Get it off!
- Okay.
Oh!

18:50.897 --> 18:52.263
Don't touch me!
- (urgent chatter)

18:52.265 --> 18:54.232
Don't touch me!
Get it off! Get it off of me!

18:54.234 --> 18:56.567
Get it away from me!
Get it off!

18:56.569 --> 18:57.935
Get it off!
- Hey, hey, the spider.

18:57.937 --> 18:59.137
Get it off! Don't touch!

18:59.139 --> 19:01.405
Hello.
Don't touch!
Get it off of me!

19:01.407 --> 19:02.907
Get it...!

19:02.909 --> 19:03.808
Schmidt.

19:03.810 --> 19:05.243
Hold still.
- COACH: Aah!

19:05.245 --> 19:07.445
Oh! Oh!
WINSTON:
Oh...

19:07.447 --> 19:08.813
SCHMIDT:
Ah!

19:09.582 --> 19:12.116
What's up now, spider?

19:12.118 --> 19:13.584
Vote Moscato!

19:13.586 --> 19:15.953
(laughing):
Well, it can't hear you.

19:15.955 --> 19:17.755
But, seriously,
vote Moscato.

19:17.757 --> 19:19.590
So, that guy, huh?

19:19.592 --> 19:20.958
Yeah. Can you blame me?

19:20.960 --> 19:22.793
He's perfect.

19:22.795 --> 19:24.262
FAWN: And when is dinner?
Is it, um...?

19:24.264 --> 19:26.097
NICK: The Sauce! Sauce.
The Sauce.

19:26.099 --> 19:27.965
Yeah. 'Cause Fawn's hungry.
COACH: My e-mails.

19:27.967 --> 19:29.767
I'm about to pick you up
with a tissue like you
wouldn't believe!

19:29.769 --> 19:31.102
So, what's the plan?

19:31.104 --> 19:32.470
Jess.
- I'm gonna pick you up

19:32.472 --> 19:33.604
with a tissue so hard!

19:33.606 --> 19:34.939
He's happy.
He has a girlfriend.

19:34.941 --> 19:36.340
SCHMIDT:
Yeah, spi-spider!

19:36.342 --> 19:38.176
I know, but it's you,

19:38.178 --> 19:40.278
and Fawn kind of scares me.

19:40.280 --> 19:42.947
Let this be a warning
to all your other little, uh,

19:42.949 --> 19:45.283
spider friends
hiding out, too.

19:45.285 --> 19:47.351
(Schmidt continues)
I know that would do
anything for anybody,

19:47.353 --> 19:49.820
but right now,
I just need you to...

19:49.822 --> 19:53.124
be there for me and
hold my hand, okay?

19:53.126 --> 19:54.458
That's all.

19:54.460 --> 19:56.294
Little half-insects,
half-lobsters.

19:56.296 --> 19:58.196
Ah...

19:58.198 --> 20:00.531
I really want to do something.

20:00.533 --> 20:03.467
Don't go up the spout if you
can't handle the rain, s-spider!

20:03.469 --> 20:05.002
Okay, well,
you've done it.

20:05.004 --> 20:06.637
The perfect burn
of the dead bug.

20:06.639 --> 20:08.039
Yeah, that's right.
- Now stop.

20:08.041 --> 20:09.540
(quietly): Okay.

20:10.476 --> 20:12.810
The Sauce is
shockingly great.

20:12.812 --> 20:14.145
FAWN:
This tastes

20:14.147 --> 20:17.982
like the inside of a bear,

20:17.984 --> 20:20.551
and that is a compliment,
my friend.

20:20.553 --> 20:21.886
SCHMIDT:
All right.

20:21.888 --> 20:23.421
(phone vibrates)
I... Oh.

20:24.324 --> 20:26.791
Oh. May responded to my e-mails.

20:28.194 --> 20:31.062
"I appreciate how much effort
you put into these.

20:31.064 --> 20:32.997
I'd love to go out."

20:32.999 --> 20:34.031
Hey.
- Great.

20:34.033 --> 20:34.999
All right.

20:35.001 --> 20:36.567
There you go.
- Yeah!

20:36.569 --> 20:37.568
Uh, you're welcome.

20:37.570 --> 20:39.437
This is great guys, right?

20:40.240 --> 20:42.006
To Fawn.
- Oh.

20:42.008 --> 20:43.341
SCHMIDT:
A woman who likes me

20:43.343 --> 20:44.842
not in spite,

20:44.844 --> 20:47.345
but<i> because</i> of my flaws.

20:47.347 --> 20:48.412
I do like you.

20:49.182 --> 20:50.982
But I hate your flaws.

20:51.718 --> 20:53.251
And to all my friends.

20:53.253 --> 20:56.420
In the spiderhunt of life...

21:00.093 --> 21:02.059
...I sure am glad
that we're a team of six.

21:02.061 --> 21:03.427
Cheers!
- Hey! Hey!

21:03.429 --> 21:04.395
To those who...

21:04.397 --> 21:05.730
Okay. No, that's good.

21:05.732 --> 21:07.798
And thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

21:21.781 --> 21:22.880
COACH:
All right, here we go.

21:22.882 --> 21:24.782
SCHMIDT: Ow.
Oh.

21:35.228 --> 21:37.628
Yeah, sweep the leg, Johnny.

21:41.401 --> 21:43.067
Ow.
Ah...

21:43.069 --> 21:46.137
Okay. Okay.

21:47.640 --> 21:49.607
COACH: All right.
Get off of me!
