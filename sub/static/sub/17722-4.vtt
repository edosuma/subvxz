07:49.500 --> 07:50.200
Wow!

07:50.200 --> 07:51.333
I know, right?

07:51.333 --> 07:53.400

though. He lives in L.A.

07:53.400 --> 07:54.766
But I really
like him.

07:54.766 --> 07:56.600

a record exec,

07:56.600 --> 07:58.000
he's sweet

07:58.000 --> 08:00.333

to debrief.

08:01.366 --> 08:03.233
Can't it wait
'til tonight?

08:03.233 --> 08:06.000

Rob over for dinner.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.100
You know what? Okay,
fine, we'll order in.

08:08.100 --> 08:10.166

Rob out for you.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.633

08:20.366 --> 08:23.366
We can be there by 2:00,
they can be there by 2:00.

08:23.366 --> 08:25.266
Understood?
Go!

I didn't mean anything.

08:37.766 --> 08:38.633
(unintelligible chatter)

08:40.400 --> 08:42.400

a different flavour.

08:42.400 --> 08:44.233

to tiger-tail

08:44.233 --> 08:45.533

in between.

08:45.533 --> 08:47.300

08:48.300 --> 08:50.533
This whole ice cream
thing, it's cute,

08:50.533 --> 08:54.100
but what I'm really digging
is the idea that's behind it.

08:54.100 --> 08:56.133
The pan-sexual
encyclopedia.

08:56.133 --> 08:57.566
That's naughty...
In a good way.

08:57.566 --> 08:59.566
You could have kept
it at just "vanilla,"

08:59.566 --> 09:01.200
but you surprised me.

09:01.200 --> 09:03.366
Great, Julianne.
Thank you.

09:03.366 --> 09:05.166
So, who's the writer?

09:05.166 --> 09:07.100
I'm... I'm still
working on that.

09:07.100 --> 09:08.333
Well, I had some
thoughts.

09:08.333 --> 09:09.633
Um, Dan Savage.

09:10.633 --> 09:12.233
I heart his column.

09:12.233 --> 09:15.266
Uh, or maybe we could talk sex
with Sue Johanson, or...

09:15.266 --> 09:16.266
Uh, Jules...

09:17.400 --> 09:19.400
This book's supposed
to revolutionize sex

09:19.400 --> 09:24.166
and leading that revolution
is a newspaper columnist?

09:24.166 --> 09:26.400
Okay, so who would you
have write the book?

09:26.400 --> 09:28.033
And don't say yourself.

09:28.033 --> 09:29.133
Friedken: anyone else.

09:29.133 --> 09:31.133
A sex trade
worker, a pimp.

09:31.133 --> 09:33.733
A 400 pound midget that
likes to wear diapers.

09:33.733 --> 09:35.566
Hell, I'd rather have
Erica write it.

09:35.566 --> 09:37.600
It was her idea. She
has the vision.

09:37.600 --> 09:38.766
Erica?

09:38.766 --> 09:40.566
Oh, no-no-no, I think
that he was joking.

09:40.566 --> 09:41.700
No, he wasn't.

09:41.700 --> 09:43.300
I had never
written a word

09:43.300 --> 09:45.633
before Julianne hired me to
write "the secret of now."

09:45.633 --> 09:46.300
Really?

09:46.300 --> 09:46.766
That's true.

09:48.166 --> 09:49.566
And look how that
turned out.

09:49.566 --> 09:51.133
(mimics air swooshing)

09:51.133 --> 09:53.433
You wanna be an author,
don't you, Erica?

09:53.433 --> 09:54.100
Um,

09:54.100 --> 09:54.600
(stammering)

09:54.600 --> 09:56.366
yes, but...

09:56.366 --> 09:57.633
But what? But what?

09:57.633 --> 10:00.300
I mean,
friedken's right.

10:00.700 --> 10:03.566
I'm willing to go
there if you are.

10:03.566 --> 10:04.600
(stunned laughter)

10:04.600 --> 10:07.433
wow, um...

10:07.433 --> 10:08.600
What about my books?

10:08.600 --> 10:11.033
Well, obviously you...
Couldn't write this book

10:11.033 --> 10:13.100
and remain an
editor here.

10:13.100 --> 10:15.166
Right, right.
Um...

10:15.166 --> 10:17.200
(laughs nervously,
stammering)

10:17.200 --> 10:20.066
do you think I could...
Can I think it over?

10:20.066 --> 10:21.066
Oh, sure.

10:22.066 --> 10:24.200
Sure. Overnight.

10:24.200 --> 10:25.333
Okay.

10:25.333 --> 10:27.200
(excited giggle)

10:29.500 --> 10:30.500
Um...

10:35.200 --> 10:36.666
So, I'm still
thinking about it.

10:36.666 --> 10:39.300
I just don't get what
there is to think about?

10:39.300 --> 10:42.500
Well, it's a big deal, Jenny,
I'd have to give up my job.

10:42.500 --> 10:43.700
Yeah, to become
an author.

10:43.700 --> 10:44.500
More wine?

10:44.500 --> 10:45.433
Uh, yes, please.

10:45.433 --> 10:46.700
You've wanted
to be a writer

10:46.700 --> 10:48.533
ever since you wrote
your first story

10:48.533 --> 10:50.533
in Mrs. Daily's class
back in grade one.

10:50.533 --> 10:52.133
I know, but...
No thank you.

10:53.466 --> 10:54.633
But a sex writer?

10:54.633 --> 10:56.066
Hmm...

10:57.066 --> 11:00.266
Oh, hey, I think you're
smart to sleep on it.

11:00.266 --> 11:01.600
So, in other
words, don't?

11:01.600 --> 11:04.200
No, but you're gonna have
to quit your job and...

11:04.200 --> 11:06.200
There's no guarantee the
book will turn out.

11:06.200 --> 11:07.200
Uh...

11:08.300 --> 11:09.666
Rob?

11:09.666 --> 11:10.633
(laughs)

11:10.633 --> 11:12.200
don't look at me,
we just met.

11:12.200 --> 11:14.533
Which makes you the
objective third party.

11:16.366 --> 11:17.566
Oh, okay.

11:17.566 --> 11:19.466
Um... It's
like this.

11:19.466 --> 11:20.666
Mm-hm.

11:20.666 --> 11:23.000
The world can be divided up
into two camps:

11:23.000 --> 11:25.300
you got rock stars
that make the music

11:25.300 --> 11:27.233
and roadies who set up
the equipment.

11:28.533 --> 11:31.100
No guts, no glory.

11:31.100 --> 11:33.200
That's my two cents.

11:34.200 --> 11:35.200
(glasses clink)

11:36.200 --> 11:37.700
(exhales)

11:43.700 --> 11:46.233
(inhales and exhales tensely)

11:53.766 --> 11:56.066
Friedken:
...Then on the cover,

11:56.066 --> 11:57.566
a new typeface.
Custom.

11:57.566 --> 11:59.466
We can call it "Friedken:

11:59.466 --> 12:01.766
a new font for a new world."

12:01.766 --> 12:03.366
Oh... Yeah.

12:03.366 --> 12:06.300
Uh, I'm not sure that's exactly
where we we're gonna head...

12:06.300 --> 12:08.000
(clears throat)

12:08.000 --> 12:10.333
you wanted my answer
to the book,

12:10.333 --> 12:13.033
and the answer is "yes"!

12:13.033 --> 12:15.700
Huh, I was sure
you'd chicken out.

12:15.700 --> 12:18.166
Uh, no way, no chicken
here, so, yes!

12:18.166 --> 12:18.700
Yes?

12:18.700 --> 12:19.466
Yes!

12:19.466 --> 12:20.166
Yes.

12:20.166 --> 12:20.633
Yes!

12:20.633 --> 12:22.133
'Kay. Yes.

12:22.133 --> 12:25.033
Say it like, "yes!"

12:25.033 --> 12:26.200
Yes. Um, yeah.

12:26.200 --> 12:27.266
No-no.
Say it, "yes!"

12:27.266 --> 12:27.766
Yeah.

12:27.766 --> 12:29.200
Say that. "yes!"

12:29.200 --> 12:31.000
I... You know what?
I'm just gonna...

12:31.000 --> 12:33.033
I'm gonna come back
when you're less busy.

12:33.033 --> 12:34.566
Friedken: yes!

12:35.100 --> 12:36.633
(squeals)

12:36.633 --> 12:38.233
and the answer is...

12:39.766 --> 12:41.333
"yes."

12:41.333 --> 12:44.066
That is the fifth time
in ten shakes.

12:44.066 --> 12:46.600
Very interesting,
the law of averages.

12:46.600 --> 12:48.733
Well, "yes"
works for me.

12:49.733 --> 12:51.166
It's fascinating that
some people

12:51.166 --> 12:54.266
can put so much faith
into a piece of plastic

12:54.266 --> 12:56.466
to tell their fortune.

12:56.466 --> 12:57.733
Mmm-mm-mm.

12:59.333 --> 13:01.100
"the answer is no."

13:01.633 --> 13:04.233
Well, "no" is
for cowards.

13:04.233 --> 13:05.500
Mm, harsh.

13:06.666 --> 13:08.533
Harsh, maybe,
but kinda true.

13:09.333 --> 13:11.200
I have said "no" a lot

13:12.333 --> 13:15.700
and as a result,
I've missed out.

13:16.700 --> 13:18.333
"Taipei."

13:18.333 --> 13:19.766
Regret number 18.

13:19.766 --> 13:20.600
(giggles to self)

13:20.600 --> 13:21.700
Exactly.

13:21.700 --> 13:23.366
That is a perfect example.

13:23.366 --> 13:26.000
That was the worst summer
of my life, I was...

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
I was between my undergrad
and my masters,

13:28.000 --> 13:30.233
and I had a huge debt
because of school.

13:30.233 --> 13:32.400
So I took this
well-paying job

13:32.400 --> 13:33.400
with the government,

13:33.400 --> 13:35.400
but it was deadly boring.

13:35.400 --> 13:38.766
It was my first
call-centre gig.

13:38.766 --> 13:42.033
Jenny thought I was making
the safe choice, as usual.

13:42.033 --> 13:43.566
We'd always talked about
travelling together

13:43.566 --> 13:45.133
after undergrad.

13:46.133 --> 13:48.133
So, she had this
crazy idea.

13:49.133 --> 13:51.066
Go to Taiwan for
the summer,

13:51.066 --> 13:53.166
make a ton of money
teaching ESL,

13:53.166 --> 13:56.633
and then use our savings
to travel across asia

13:56.633 --> 13:59.433
before coming back to the...
"the real world."

13:59.433 --> 14:01.500
Mm, the real world
is overrated.

14:02.500 --> 14:04.166
I thought so,

14:04.166 --> 14:06.033
so I quit my job.

14:06.033 --> 14:07.633
I booked a ticket
to Taipei.

14:07.633 --> 14:09.566
It was...

14:09.566 --> 14:12.666
It was gonna be
my grand awakening.

14:13.666 --> 14:16.233
But then right before
we were about to leave,

14:16.233 --> 14:18.133
I chickened out.

14:18.133 --> 14:20.366
I suddenly realized that
the only plan we had

14:20.366 --> 14:21.600
once we got there...

14:21.600 --> 14:23.033
Was to just wing it.

14:23.033 --> 14:25.033
We were gonna stay
in a youth hostel,

14:25.033 --> 14:26.300
and the jobs we had,

14:26.300 --> 14:28.300
we found on some
sketchy website.

14:28.300 --> 14:32.466
So instead of forcing myself
to get into that cab,

14:33.466 --> 14:34.733
I walked away.

14:35.733 --> 14:37.733
I got my job back,

14:37.733 --> 14:41.500
and I spent the summer
miserable and bored.

14:42.233 --> 14:43.166
(sighs)

14:43.166 --> 14:46.266
If I hadn't have
been so afraid,

14:46.266 --> 14:48.600
who knows what woulda
happened?

14:48.600 --> 14:50.733
Perhaps it's time
to find out.

14:54.300 --> 14:55.300
(cab rumbles away)

14:57.133 --> 14:59.100
Wait! Jenny! Jenny!

14:59.100 --> 15:00.766
Hey!

15:00.766 --> 15:01.766
I changed my mind.

15:01.766 --> 15:02.766
Are you sure?

15:02.766 --> 15:05.533
100,000 percent, yes.

15:05.533 --> 15:06.600
All right!

15:07.600 --> 15:08.433
Woo-hoo!

15:08.433 --> 15:09.433
Jenny:
woo-hoo!

15:11.500 --> 15:16.366
♪

15:17.366 --> 15:19.633
(low hum of chatter,
traffic rumbles along)

15:24.000 --> 15:25.133
Palace, huh?

15:26.133 --> 15:29.100
Palace is a bit
of a stretch.

15:31.166 --> 15:34.200
Well, it looks
very authentic.

15:34.200 --> 15:35.600
Authentically filthy.

15:35.600 --> 15:37.666
Listen, I have my parents'
credit card here

15:37.666 --> 15:39.200
in case of emergencies.

15:39.200 --> 15:41.033
Lonely planet says
there's a 5-star hotel

15:41.033 --> 15:42.233
right down the street.

15:42.233 --> 15:43.466
(hesitant whine)

15:43.466 --> 15:44.600
Come on!

15:44.600 --> 15:48.533
No, Jenny, we are here
for an adventure.

15:48.533 --> 15:49.466
Ugh...

15:49.466 --> 15:50.266
Let's go.

15:50.266 --> 15:51.000
Yeah-yeah.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.433
I'm sorry.

15:52.433 --> 15:54.466
Erica: we are in a
great location.

15:54.466 --> 15:56.700
We're just down the road
from the peace park,

15:56.700 --> 15:58.733
we're a short walk
to the MRT line...

15:58.733 --> 16:00.133
Whoa, Erica,
watch the puke.

16:00.133 --> 16:01.300
Erica: Oh God.

16:01.300 --> 16:02.433
Wow.

16:02.433 --> 16:04.100
Wow, puddles of puke.

16:04.100 --> 16:05.600
This hostel
sure is authentic.

16:05.600 --> 16:07.400
We're livin' on
the edge.

16:07.400 --> 16:08.400
Woo-hoo.

16:10.433 --> 16:11.100
Hi.

16:11.100 --> 16:12.066
Hey.

16:16.533 --> 16:19.433
See, the Taipei Palace
has its merits.

16:19.433 --> 16:20.600
Where's our room?

16:20.600 --> 16:22.733
I need to get some sleep
before our first day.

16:22.733 --> 16:23.766
Female:
oh god.

16:23.766 --> 16:25.100
(bed springs squeak)

16:25.100 --> 16:26.766
Oh God...

16:26.766 --> 16:28.633
Oh God!

16:28.633 --> 16:29.733
(woman moans)

16:29.733 --> 16:31.133
Oh God!

16:31.133 --> 16:32.133
(woman moans)

16:32.133 --> 16:33.000
Oh!

16:33.000 --> 16:35.266
Bloody hell,
don't stop!

16:35.266 --> 16:36.333
(girl whines)

16:38.166 --> 16:39.200
All right.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.466
Hi, I'm Laurie
from Bristol.

16:44.466 --> 16:45.533
Laurie, I'm Erica.

16:45.533 --> 16:47.133
Uh, this is Jenny
from Toronto.

16:47.133 --> 16:48.000
(awkward stammer)

16:48.000 --> 16:49.266
We can come
back later.

16:49.266 --> 16:51.566
No, no, it's all right,
I'll just bring him back.

16:51.566 --> 16:53.600
You know, finish
what we started.

16:53.600 --> 16:54.433
Right.

16:54.433 --> 16:55.466
(laughs)

16:57.500 --> 16:59.133
She was joking,
right?

16:59.133 --> 17:01.333
And the adventure
continues.

17:01.333 --> 17:04.066
Hope you packed
earplugs.

17:11.766 --> 17:14.166
Jenny, it feels like we've
walked here before.

17:14.166 --> 17:16.566
Excuse me, do you know
where chengdu road is?

17:18.233 --> 17:19.333
Oh! Hey,
sorry.

17:22.333 --> 17:24.366
Hey, jenny? Jenny!

17:26.033 --> 17:27.233
Can I help you?

17:27.233 --> 17:31.100
Oh, thank God,
someone who speaks English.

17:33.133 --> 17:34.366
Nice backpack.

17:34.366 --> 17:36.100
Thanks.

17:36.100 --> 17:38.733
So, how goes
the big adventure?

17:38.733 --> 17:41.733
Uh, it's...
It's been an experience.

17:41.733 --> 17:43.633
You know,
Taipei, it's...

17:43.633 --> 17:45.033
It's interesting.
It's...

17:45.033 --> 17:47.000
Actually, it's been
pretty awful so far.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
Huh.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.633
I thought this
was supposed to be

17:49.633 --> 17:51.733
the most amazing
summer ever?

17:51.733 --> 17:53.433
Yeah, well, right now,
that...

17:53.433 --> 17:56.133
That cubicle in richmond hill
is looking pretty comfy.

17:56.133 --> 17:58.133
Mmm. Right.

17:58.133 --> 17:59.266
Stinky tofu?

18:00.266 --> 18:02.000
Oh, that smells like
rotten garbage.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.300
Yeah.

18:03.300 --> 18:04.766
That's because it's been
fermented in shrimp brine,

18:04.766 --> 18:07.133
mustard greens
and chinese herbs.

18:07.133 --> 18:09.566
The soup base, called mala,
is goose blood.

18:09.566 --> 18:11.000
Mmm.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.666
It's the unofficial snack
food here in Taiwan.

18:12.666 --> 18:14.600
You know, like
donuts in Canada.

18:14.600 --> 18:16.033
Go ahead.

18:16.033 --> 18:18.266
The more stinky the tofu is,
the better the taste.

18:18.266 --> 18:19.500
Try it.

18:19.500 --> 18:20.633
Oh, god.

18:22.333 --> 18:24.600
(low hum of chatter,
traffic rumbles)

18:27.266 --> 18:28.500
actually, it's
not that bad.

18:28.500 --> 18:30.433
(chuckles)

18:30.433 --> 18:33.033
"it doesn't work to leap
a twenty foot chasm

18:33.033 --> 18:35.133
in two ten-foot jumps."

18:35.133 --> 18:36.466
American proverb.

18:36.466 --> 18:38.133
And chengdu road,
by the way,

18:38.133 --> 18:39.700
is two blocks that way.

18:39.700 --> 18:41.133
Enjoy.

18:41.133 --> 18:42.000
Thank you.

18:42.000 --> 18:42.466
(sighs)

18:42.466 --> 18:44.466
Okay, hey.

18:44.466 --> 18:45.666
Hey, where have
you been?

18:45.666 --> 18:48.066
I saw a white guy
go into a shop

18:48.066 --> 18:50.266
and I ran like a psycho
to catch him.

18:50.266 --> 18:51.466
He gave me
directions and...

18:51.466 --> 18:52.266
What's that smell?

18:52.266 --> 18:53.566
Uh, stinky tofu.

18:54.333 --> 18:55.666
Ew. Okay.

18:55.666 --> 18:58.100
How about we go
for a big mac, instead?

18:58.100 --> 18:58.700
(squeals excitedly)

18:58.700 --> 19:00.566
Let's get to work.

19:00.566 --> 19:02.266
It's up here.

19:04.300 --> 19:06.300
I pay $300
a week.

19:06.300 --> 19:08.466
Your ad, it
said $400.

19:08.466 --> 19:11.066
Four hundred
if you're on work visa.

19:11.066 --> 19:13.433
Three hundred
if you aren't.

19:13.433 --> 19:15.566
$300 sounds
more than fair.

19:15.566 --> 19:17.466
Jenny, you have
the four-year-olds.

19:17.466 --> 19:19.566
Score! Little
kids love me.

19:19.566 --> 19:22.566
Erica, I noticed you have
camp experience,

19:22.566 --> 19:25.366
so, I'm giving you
a bit more of a challenge.

19:31.100 --> 19:32.666
Their teacher
had an emergency,

19:32.666 --> 19:34.200
and had to leave.

19:34.200 --> 19:36.266
She was teaching the
class their song

19:36.266 --> 19:38.366
for the upcoming
parents' showcase.

19:38.366 --> 19:40.200
Oh, what song?

19:40.200 --> 19:42.400
"where does my heart
beat now."

19:42.400 --> 19:44.533
That's Celine Dion,
fellow Canadian.

19:44.533 --> 19:46.066
Represent!

19:46.066 --> 19:47.766
You look like Celine Dion.

19:47.766 --> 19:49.500
Same height, same hair,
same mouth.

19:50.500 --> 19:51.500
You could be sisters.

19:51.500 --> 19:53.500
Mm, just don't ask
to hear her sing.

19:53.500 --> 19:55.700
Trust me, the resemblance
ends there.

19:55.700 --> 19:57.200
Anyway,

19:57.200 --> 20:01.000
the kids know the words,
they just need to practice.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.766
Okay, well, maybe I'll sign
some autographs.

20:09.700 --> 20:10.700
Thank you.

20:13.200 --> 20:14.200
Uh, hello.

20:18.633 --> 20:19.633
Okay, everyone!

20:19.633 --> 20:21.100
(kids screaming)

20:21.100 --> 20:24.133
Everyone, sitting
down, okay?!

20:24.133 --> 20:27.000
Please, shhh! Be
quiet! Shhh!

20:27.000 --> 20:28.100
Shh-shh-shh-shh.

20:28.100 --> 20:29.100
Oh.

20:31.233 --> 20:34.000
Sitting down,
everyone! Sit!

20:34.000 --> 20:35.433
Shay...

20:35.433 --> 20:37.566
Shay hoi shoo-oh
ing when?

20:39.266 --> 20:43.233
Hey, do... Do you... Hi,
do you speak English?

20:43.233 --> 20:44.366
Do you speak English?

20:44.366 --> 20:46.566
Okay, 'cause I need you
to help me, okay?

20:46.566 --> 20:50.366
Can you tell everyone here
to stand in a lineup,

20:50.366 --> 20:52.000
so that we can sing
our song.

20:52.000 --> 20:52.533
(grunts)

20:52.533 --> 20:54.066
Ouch!

20:54.066 --> 20:56.266
Oh my God!
Look, stay back!

20:56.266 --> 20:57.266
Little monster!

20:57.266 --> 20:58.666
Back!
No, no, no!

20:59.666 --> 21:01.133
(traffic rumbles loudly)

21:04.100 --> 21:07.466
man: (sings "I Will
Survive" in Cantonese)

21:16.400 --> 21:18.000
Oh, I hate to say it,

21:18.000 --> 21:19.600
but you look down right
pathetic.

21:19.600 --> 21:21.366
What if it's fractured?

21:21.366 --> 21:24.300
I can't believe some
kid karate-chopped you.

21:24.300 --> 21:25.400
(laugh)

21:25.400 --> 21:27.500
look, knock a few of
these cosmos back

21:27.500 --> 21:29.100
and you won't feel
a thing.

21:29.100 --> 21:30.033
Trust me.

21:30.033 --> 21:31.733
These cosmos cost $20 bucks.

21:31.733 --> 21:33.666
I can afford
to knock back one.

21:33.666 --> 21:35.700
You hate it here,
don't you?

21:35.700 --> 21:37.300
No. No!

21:37.300 --> 21:38.366
Okay.

21:38.366 --> 21:40.566
I just need to stop
living in fear

21:40.566 --> 21:42.266
and start living the life.

21:42.266 --> 21:44.166
Look, sitting here
and talking the talk

21:44.166 --> 21:45.533
ain't gonna cut it,
yeah?

21:45.533 --> 21:47.666
You've gotta walk
the walk.

21:47.666 --> 21:50.500
You know what, Laurie?
You're absolutely right.

21:50.500 --> 21:51.700
Let's get out of here,

21:51.700 --> 21:53.433
let's just go do
something crazy.

21:53.433 --> 21:56.066
Something wild and risky.

21:56.066 --> 21:57.733
Yes. Excuse me.
Cheque please.

21:57.733 --> 22:00.133
You know, maybe we could
hitchhike out of Taipei,

22:00.133 --> 22:01.733
and go all bohemian.

22:01.733 --> 22:03.266
You know, take odd jobs,

22:03.266 --> 22:05.133
sleep in the countryside.

22:05.133 --> 22:07.600
Just, just really live
for the moment, you know?

22:07.600 --> 22:09.300
Oh my God.

22:09.300 --> 22:10.300
Hmm.

22:12.066 --> 22:13.333
Oh my God.

22:14.733 --> 22:19.266
$13,200 Taiwanese dollars
for six cosmos?

22:19.266 --> 22:21.500
Six cosmos
and a table fee?

22:21.500 --> 22:24.600
That's like $400 american.
I have maybe $50.

22:24.600 --> 22:26.266
I don't have any cash.

22:27.266 --> 22:28.266
Um...

22:32.166 --> 22:33.433
Just don't draw
any attention,

22:33.433 --> 22:36.633
we'll slip out,
no one'll notice.

22:45.300 --> 22:46.766
Watch out

22:46.766 --> 22:49.233
he eats dishonest westerners
for breakfast.

22:49.233 --> 22:51.233
I'd pay your bill,
if I were you.

22:53.633 --> 22:56.200
Oh, pay our bill?
But the, um...

22:56.200 --> 22:59.066
The owner, he said that our
drinks were complimentary.

22:59.066 --> 23:00.733
Right, we're VIP guests.

23:00.733 --> 23:01.733
Yes.

23:01.733 --> 23:02.700
(laughs)

23:02.700 --> 23:04.400
it's true,
I am very generous

23:04.400 --> 23:07.066
with my VIP clients.

23:07.066 --> 23:08.533
You're the owner?

23:08.533 --> 23:09.533
Really?

23:09.533 --> 23:10.700
Are you Americans?

23:10.700 --> 23:13.266
Uh, Canadians. Two
Canadians and a brit.

23:13.266 --> 23:14.733
Hmm. That's so strange,

23:14.733 --> 23:18.166
I don't remember any Canadians
on my VIP list tonight.

23:18.166 --> 23:21.533
Sorry, remind me
of your name, miss...

23:21.533 --> 23:22.566
Dion.

23:22.566 --> 23:25.000
Miss. Celine Dion.

23:25.733 --> 23:26.400
(laughs)

23:26.400 --> 23:28.200
Of course,

23:28.200 --> 23:30.033
how could I have
missed it?

23:30.033 --> 23:31.066
Everyone,

23:31.066 --> 23:34.166
we have the one and
only Celine Dion

23:34.166 --> 23:36.033
gracing our bar.

23:37.033 --> 23:39.733
You must honor us
with a song.

23:39.733 --> 23:42.033
Oh, no, I usually don't,
for my throat.

23:42.033 --> 23:43.233
Just saving it,
you know?

23:43.233 --> 23:45.033
You want me to
waive your bill

23:45.033 --> 23:47.066
and you won't even
perform one song?

23:47.066 --> 23:48.266
That is not very generous.

23:48.266 --> 23:51.000
It's true, Celine,
you're being rude.

23:51.666 --> 23:52.666
Mm-hmm.

23:57.033 --> 24:00.366
Bien sur. One song

25:18.600 --> 25:21.366
(low hum of

25:21.366 --> 25:24.433
I thought everyone in Asia
lived on top of each other.

25:24.433 --> 25:26.766
Lots of people
do, I don't.

25:26.766 --> 25:28.566
In fact, I don't
even live here.

25:28.566 --> 25:31.133
So what do you do
with all this space?

25:31.133 --> 25:32.666
Rent it out.

25:32.666 --> 25:34.100
Usually over chinese
new year.

25:34.100 --> 25:35.433
Summer is the low season,

25:35.433 --> 25:38.100
so I use it for parties
or whatever.

25:38.100 --> 25:39.300
So, no one's here now?

25:39.300 --> 25:42.133
I mean minus 30
of your closest friends.

25:42.133 --> 25:43.700
Thirty-three after tonight.

25:43.700 --> 25:45.200
Oh. Huh.

25:45.200 --> 25:46.600
Erica: so....

25:46.600 --> 25:50.133
How much would you charge
three very nice and responsible,

25:50.133 --> 25:53.533
yet severely underpaid
ESL teachers?

25:53.533 --> 25:55.400
Depends, what's
in it for me?

25:55.400 --> 25:58.133
Oh, our... Our rent,

25:58.133 --> 25:59.366
measly as it may be,

25:59.366 --> 26:01.366
and, well, we can, uh,
I don't know...

26:01.366 --> 26:03.033
Throw in some free
English lessons-

26:03.033 --> 26:04.533
not that you
need any, and...

26:04.533 --> 26:05.566
Tell you what,

26:05.566 --> 26:07.166
How 'bout you keep your
money

26:07.166 --> 26:08.233
and your English lessons

26:08.233 --> 26:10.166
and you stay here as
my guests.

26:11.600 --> 26:13.333
Stay here for free?

26:13.333 --> 26:14.233
Yes.

26:14.233 --> 26:15.333
That is so generous
of you.

26:15.333 --> 26:16.600
That would be brilliant.

26:16.600 --> 26:18.733
Uh, wait up, hold
up, time out.

26:18.733 --> 26:20.233
Erica, Erica, don't.

26:20.233 --> 26:22.166
Jenny, I have to.

26:23.133 --> 26:24.266
Look, kendrick,
that's...

26:24.266 --> 26:26.433
That's a very
generous offer.

26:26.433 --> 26:28.333
It's too generous.

26:28.333 --> 26:30.533
There are no strings
attached to my offer.

26:30.533 --> 26:32.266
You move in,
we enjoy ourselves,

26:32.266 --> 26:34.033
whatever happens,
happens.

26:34.033 --> 26:36.433
And what if we don't want
anything to happen?

26:36.433 --> 26:38.100
Then it doesn't.

26:39.100 --> 26:41.300
It goes without saying
that I'm inviting you here

26:41.300 --> 26:45.500
because I find all three of you
charming and beautiful.

26:45.500 --> 26:47.733
You won't hold my honesty
against me, I hope?

26:47.733 --> 26:49.333
I didn't hold
your deception tonight

26:49.333 --> 26:50.666
against you.

26:50.666 --> 26:51.733
(awkward chuckle)

26:53.033 --> 26:54.200
we'd love to stay.

26:54.200 --> 26:56.033
Cheers!

26:56.033 --> 26:57.033

27:00.366 --> 27:01.366

28:11.133 --> 28:12.600
Jenny.

28:12.600 --> 28:13.633
Oh, God.

28:14.633 --> 28:15.733
Oh God.

28:15.733 --> 28:18.000
Mrs. Li:
(speaking in mandarin)

28:18.000 --> 28:19.666
red:

28:19.666 --> 28:22.000
r-e-d.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.000
Red.

28:25.133 --> 28:26.533
(speaks in mandarin)

28:26.533 --> 28:28.166
Hi, I'm so sorry.

28:28.166 --> 28:29.766
There was construction
on the nangang line

28:29.766 --> 28:31.166
and then my MRT pass,

28:31.166 --> 28:32.766
it wouldn't swipe
at the guandu station.

28:32.766 --> 28:35.000
So then I had
to take a taxi.

28:35.000 --> 28:36.400
Or maybe you party
all night

28:36.400 --> 28:38.200
and woke up late.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.133
The showcase is
tomorrow night, Erica.

28:41.133 --> 28:44.133
I need you here,
not at some party.

28:44.133 --> 28:46.666
I will be here,
I promise.

28:53.533 --> 28:54.533
Good morning.

28:56.600 --> 28:59.566
(traffic rumbles,
dance music plays)

29:02.266 --> 29:04.266
(low hum of chatter)

29:14.100 --> 29:15.666
okay, so...
Teaching hungover?

29:15.666 --> 29:17.233
Not so fun.

29:17.233 --> 29:19.533
If it's okay with you guys,
I'm just gonna go to bed.

29:19.533 --> 29:22.000
No. No, no. No way.
You're not going to bed.

29:22.000 --> 29:22.466
(laughs)

29:22.466 --> 29:23.233
Jenny.

29:23.233 --> 29:25.166
Not until you say "yes."

29:25.166 --> 29:27.200
Okay, fine, yes,
what?

29:27.200 --> 29:29.433
You just agreed to fly
to hong kong tomorrow

29:29.433 --> 29:30.500
for the weekend!

29:30.500 --> 29:32.233
Kendrick has rented out
the entire floor

29:32.233 --> 29:34.266
of this, like, crazy,
luxury hotel.

29:34.266 --> 29:35.266
It's amazing.

29:35.266 --> 29:37.000
Oh, you guys,
I can't.

29:37.000 --> 29:38.400
What? It's like
an hour flight,

29:38.400 --> 29:41.266
it won't cost you anything
and you get your own room.

29:41.266 --> 29:43.400
I'm sharing
with kendrick.

29:48.033 --> 29:50.533
Look, I have the showcase,
I'm serious, Jenny.

29:50.533 --> 29:52.733
I promised Mrs. Li
that I would be there.

29:52.733 --> 29:55.066
Erica, you have given
Mrs. Li your blood,

29:55.066 --> 29:56.066
sweat and tears.

29:56.066 --> 29:57.766
For what?!
To be underpaid?

29:57.766 --> 29:59.600
To work for free
on a saturday?

29:59.600 --> 30:00.733
Jenny!

30:00.733 --> 30:02.766
We came to Taipei
to have an adventure.

30:02.766 --> 30:05.000
When are you gonna get
this chance again?

30:05.000 --> 30:06.600
(sighs, unsure)

30:08.100 --> 30:09.366
Well, I guess...

30:09.366 --> 30:11.166
You know, I could
call Mrs. Li

30:11.166 --> 30:12.366
and give her some warning.

30:12.366 --> 30:13.766
The kids,
they know the song

30:13.766 --> 30:15.600
and I've got them
this far.

30:15.600 --> 30:16.666
So...

30:16.666 --> 30:18.466
Let me go get kendrick's
cell phone.

30:18.466 --> 30:20.266
We are gonna have
an incredible time.

30:20.266 --> 30:23.133
(squeal excitedly)

30:25.333 --> 30:26.366
Cheers.

30:29.633 --> 30:32.433
Erica: Hi, Mrs. Li,
it's Erica Strange.

30:32.433 --> 30:34.066
Uh...

30:34.066 --> 30:35.733
Listen, I'm...
Something's come up

30:35.733 --> 30:37.766
and I'm not gonna
be able to make

30:37.766 --> 30:39.366
the parents showcase
tomorrow.

30:39.366 --> 30:41.600
I do realize
that it's short notice

30:41.600 --> 30:44.200
and I apologize
for that,

30:44.733 --> 30:46.766
but the kids,
they did a great job

30:46.766 --> 30:49.066
on the dress rehearsal
and...

30:49.066 --> 30:51.733
I'm sure they'll
be great.

30:51.733 --> 30:52.733
Bye.

30:54.666 --> 30:57.633
(music plays,
low hum of chatter)

31:01.600 --> 31:04.333
(soft moans)

31:08.300 --> 31:09.300
Ugh...

31:13.666 --> 31:15.000
(giggling)

31:17.233 --> 31:18.233
Erica: Jenny?

31:18.233 --> 31:19.666
Hey, we need to talk.

31:19.666 --> 31:22.000
What is it?

31:22.000 --> 31:25.000
I just went to the kitchen
and I saw...

31:25.000 --> 31:28.466
I saw Kendrick and Laurie
making out.

31:31.733 --> 31:32.733
So?

31:34.000 --> 31:35.100
So?

31:35.100 --> 31:36.633
Yes, Erica...
Come on, it's okay.

31:36.633 --> 31:38.033
How is it okay?
I...

31:38.033 --> 31:39.666
I thought that you
were with Kendrick?

31:39.666 --> 31:42.066
I mean, you guys
are all over each other,

31:42.066 --> 31:43.466
you're sharing rooms
in Hong Kong...

31:43.466 --> 31:44.500
Look, Erica,

31:44.500 --> 31:45.500
I'm not worried
about this, okay,

31:45.500 --> 31:47.366
and you shouldn't
be either.

31:47.366 --> 31:48.200
Really?

31:48.200 --> 31:48.666
Really.

31:48.666 --> 31:50.166
Kendrick: Jenny.

31:52.000 --> 31:53.266
What's this for?

31:53.266 --> 31:54.466
Hong Kong.

31:54.466 --> 31:56.400
I'm sending a car
to pick you girls up tomorrow.

31:56.400 --> 31:58.433
I want you to buy
something nice.

31:58.433 --> 32:00.733
All three of you.
No backpacker clothes.

32:00.733 --> 32:02.366
Oh my god,
thank you.

32:02.366 --> 32:04.366
I can't believe we're
going to Hong Kong!

32:04.366 --> 32:06.166
It's gonna be a
total blast!

32:06.166 --> 32:07.166
Yes.

32:08.466 --> 32:10.566
(music plays,
partygoers chatter)

Jenny,
what're you doing?

32:54.500 --> 32:55.600
What?

32:55.600 --> 32:56.666
What?
With Kendrick.

32:56.666 --> 32:58.200
What the hell
was that performance?

32:58.200 --> 33:00.000
Erica, it's fine.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.500
It's fine because he paid
you a bunch of money?

33:02.500 --> 33:04.100
What are you,
his girlfriend?

33:04.100 --> 33:04.733
You're his mistress?

33:04.733 --> 33:06.200
A part of his harem?

33:06.200 --> 33:08.400
Okay, tone it down,
drama queen.

33:08.400 --> 33:09.600
Look, I'm sorry,
but...

33:09.600 --> 33:11.533
I don't understand
how you're okay with this.

33:11.533 --> 33:12.533
And I don't understand

33:12.533 --> 33:15.000
how this is
any of your business.

33:16.000 --> 33:17.266
Jenny!

33:17.266 --> 33:19.433
Look, it's my business
because you are my friend

33:19.433 --> 33:21.766
and he's treating you
like a piece of meat.

33:21.766 --> 33:23.400
Oh, I'm a piece of meat?

33:23.400 --> 33:24.500
Okay, and you're not?

33:24.500 --> 33:26.600
I'm not the one that's
making out with him,

33:26.600 --> 33:28.200
or kissing Laurie
on his say-so

33:28.200 --> 33:29.500
because he pays me.

33:29.500 --> 33:32.066
I mean, Jenny,
you are acting like...

33:32.066 --> 33:33.466
A whore?

33:33.733 --> 33:35.133
You know what?
You're right.

33:35.133 --> 33:36.533
You're not making out
with him.

33:36.533 --> 33:38.133
But you're living
in his place

33:38.133 --> 33:39.366
and you're eating his food,

33:39.366 --> 33:41.066
so what does that
make you?!

33:41.066 --> 33:43.266
You know what, Erica?
The problem with you

33:43.266 --> 33:45.466
is that you're scared
of everything.

33:45.466 --> 33:47.533
No, that is not
what this is about.

33:47.533 --> 33:48.633
Yes. Yes, it is.

33:48.633 --> 33:50.500
We have an incredible thing
going here

33:50.500 --> 33:52.000
and you wanna ruin it

33:52.000 --> 33:55.666
by looking for problems
that don't exist.

33:56.666 --> 33:59.100
I have to go pack.

33:59.100 --> 34:00.233
Now? Pack tomorrow,

34:00.233 --> 34:01.633
our flight doesn't leave
till late.

34:01.633 --> 34:03.666
No, not for Hong Kong.

34:03.666 --> 34:06.200
I'm going back
to the palace.

34:06.200 --> 34:07.300
Erica.

34:07.300 --> 34:08.699
Don't, don't-don't-don't.
Look....

34:08.699 --> 34:10.300
Come on, I am
sorry, okay?

34:10.300 --> 34:12.166
I don't want us
to fight and...

34:12.166 --> 34:14.699
Don't skip out on this
and Hong Kong just 'cause...

34:14.699 --> 34:17.100
'cause I'm drunk and not
watching what I say.

34:17.100 --> 34:18.266
No, it's fine.

34:18.266 --> 34:19.766
Jenny, you're right,
it's none of my business.

34:19.766 --> 34:22.366
And even if I don't like
what's going on here,

34:22.366 --> 34:24.733
it's your life,
it is your call,

34:24.733 --> 34:26.566
but this is
not for me.

34:26.566 --> 34:29.433
Erica, please
don't do this.

34:32.533 --> 34:34.533
(hurried panting)

34:35.433 --> 34:37.166
I'm-i'm sorry.

34:37.566 --> 34:40.066
I am here to do the
showcase if...

34:40.066 --> 34:41.466
If you still
want me to.

34:41.466 --> 34:45.066
Mrs. Li: good to have
you here, Erica.

34:45.066 --> 34:46.533
Now, children,
it's time.

34:46.533 --> 34:47.533
Big smiles.

34:49.166 --> 34:51.500
Remember to smile
big, okay?

34:51.500 --> 34:52.500
(children giggle)

34:55.133 --> 34:56.133
Okay...

35:00.566 --> 35:01.633
(exhales, annoyed)

35:01.633 --> 35:03.166
You know you could've
sent me to Taipei

35:03.166 --> 35:05.000
the same way
you brought me back

35:05.000 --> 35:06.600
and saved me
a 24 hour flight.

35:06.600 --> 35:08.633
Well, you said you wanted
the full adventure;

35:08.633 --> 35:10.233
I gave you
the full adventure.

35:10.233 --> 35:11.633
Yeah? Well, it
turns out

35:11.633 --> 35:14.366
that I am not the full
adventure type, after all.

35:14.366 --> 35:16.400
I don't think
that's true.

35:16.400 --> 35:19.600
I just think it depends on
what the adventure is.

35:19.600 --> 35:21.200
The people
that take the risk

35:21.200 --> 35:23.000
are the people
that get the reward.

35:23.000 --> 35:25.133
Everyone knows that.

35:27.600 --> 35:28.600
What?

35:36.466 --> 35:39.200
My daughter
used to take risks

35:39.200 --> 35:41.233
all the time.

35:41.233 --> 35:45.200
In fact, it was the thing
that defined her,

35:45.200 --> 35:47.733
and of course,
terrified me.

35:48.733 --> 35:50.233
I used to think

35:50.233 --> 35:53.433
that there was nothing
that Sara wouldn't try.

35:53.433 --> 35:55.100
And some people,
her friends,

35:55.100 --> 35:57.766
admired her for that,
but...

36:02.366 --> 36:04.366
Well, I only bring
it up because...

36:04.366 --> 36:06.766
I happen to think
that sometimes

36:06.766 --> 36:08.166
the biggest risk of all

36:08.166 --> 36:11.333
can be the willingness
to say "no."

36:13.600 --> 36:14.633
Brent: Erica?

36:15.500 --> 36:17.566
We're all waiting
for you.

36:17.566 --> 36:19.366
Oh right, um...

36:29.500 --> 36:31.133
Excuse me. Hi, um,
Julianne,

36:31.133 --> 36:33.366
can I talk to you
for a second, please?

36:33.366 --> 36:34.766
Oh, you'll be spending
all day

36:34.766 --> 36:36.533
speaking with me.

36:36.533 --> 36:38.566
Right after we make
this "offish."

36:38.566 --> 36:40.333
Brent...

36:40.333 --> 36:44.333
You will be taking over
Erica's slate, so...

36:44.333 --> 36:48.000
First is "Rocket Man"
by Marcus Stahl.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
And then my personal
favourite,

36:50.000 --> 36:51.733
"The None"
by Katie Atkins.

36:52.733 --> 36:55.433
That's my personal
favourite, too.

36:56.433 --> 36:59.100
Actually, Julianne,
um...

36:59.100 --> 37:01.300
What I wanted to talk
to you about is,

37:01.300 --> 37:02.566
is that...

37:04.033 --> 37:06.400
I can't write
the sex book.

37:06.400 --> 37:07.500
What?

37:07.500 --> 37:09.300
I'm sorry, I'm not
the person you need.

37:09.300 --> 37:11.633
I am not
a self-help writer.

37:11.633 --> 37:14.000
Uh-oh, someone
has cold feet.

37:14.000 --> 37:15.466
It's more than
just cold feet.

37:15.466 --> 37:16.666
It's...
It's not for me.

37:16.666 --> 37:17.666
And the truth is,

37:17.666 --> 37:20.200
is that I don't wanna
quit my job.

37:20.200 --> 37:21.500
And I realize,
believe me,

37:21.500 --> 37:23.533
that this an incredible
opportunity.

37:23.533 --> 37:25.133
Oh, you bet
it is.

37:25.133 --> 37:27.433
But I thought you wanted
to be an author.

37:27.433 --> 37:28.566
I do.

37:28.566 --> 37:30.600
It's my dream to...
To write literature

37:30.600 --> 37:33.600
and short stories
and essays, but...

37:35.366 --> 37:38.433
I don't wanna write
a sex book.

37:41.766 --> 37:44.100
I'm sorry, chicken,

37:45.633 --> 37:48.700
looks like Erica
has come back to roost.

37:57.166 --> 37:58.600
If you'll excuse me.

37:58.600 --> 38:00.600
Brent, I'm really sorry.

38:00.600 --> 38:03.233
Oh, I'm making everything
so complicated.

38:03.233 --> 38:05.166
Yeah, no guff.

38:06.166 --> 38:09.600
Well, I can't say I "love"
this turn of events,

38:10.533 --> 38:12.733
but I can't force you
to write a book

38:12.733 --> 38:16.266
that your heart
is clearly not into.

38:16.266 --> 38:17.600
One more time.

38:18.600 --> 38:20.200
You're sure?

38:25.466 --> 38:26.766
Completely.

38:29.433 --> 38:31.700
Brent: listen,
Mr. Galvin.

38:31.700 --> 38:33.133
(exhales heavily)

38:33.133 --> 38:35.466
I want you to know that
I only sent that email

38:35.466 --> 38:37.400
because I care
about river rock

38:37.400 --> 38:41.266
and I would hate to see
non-fiction falter...

38:41.266 --> 38:43.366
Because my manager's
having an affair

38:43.366 --> 38:45.133
with one of
our authors.

38:45.133 --> 38:46.666
Friedken,
yes?

38:46.666 --> 38:47.700
Yes.

38:47.700 --> 38:49.100
And I believe
their relationship

38:49.100 --> 38:51.133
is compromising
Julianne's leadership.

38:51.133 --> 38:52.533
In what way?

38:53.533 --> 38:56.600
Well, um...
She's distracted.

38:56.600 --> 38:58.566
She's making snap decisions.

38:58.566 --> 39:01.433
Like asking junior editors
to be authors.

39:01.433 --> 39:04.166
What? Which
junior editor?

39:05.700 --> 39:07.000
Brent.

39:07.000 --> 39:08.300
Um, Erica, sir.

39:09.300 --> 39:11.133
But that was
Julianne's doing.

39:11.133 --> 39:12.300
Friedken's and hers.

39:12.300 --> 39:16.000
She's not thinking
clearly, sir.

39:16.000 --> 39:17.200
Books, Brent.

39:18.233 --> 39:19.666
They're all I care about.

39:19.666 --> 39:22.300
When I start to see
this quarter's work roll out,

39:22.300 --> 39:25.433
I will know immediately
if you're right.

39:25.433 --> 39:29.433
It's a ballsy move
coming to me like this.

39:35.466 --> 39:37.200
(tense exhale)

39:41.333 --> 39:42.333
(knocking on door)

39:42.333 --> 39:43.333
Coming!

39:49.033 --> 39:49.566
Hey!

39:49.566 --> 39:51.100
Surprise!

39:51.100 --> 39:54.700
it's to celebrate your book,
and me meeting a great guy.

39:54.700 --> 39:56.033
What's this?

39:56.033 --> 39:57.666
Oh, I'm just...

39:57.666 --> 40:00.133
Cleaning out some of
my stuff in the closet

40:00.133 --> 40:01.000
for Ethan's things

40:01.000 --> 40:04.466
because he's moving in.

40:04.466 --> 40:06.466
Erica, this is
fantastic!

40:06.466 --> 40:07.500
(giggle happily)

40:07.500 --> 40:10.333
Look at you,
living with Ethan,

40:10.333 --> 40:12.233
soon to be
a published writer.

40:12.233 --> 40:13.600
What's next?

40:13.600 --> 40:16.666
Actually, I passed
on the book.

40:16.666 --> 40:17.366
Oh.

40:17.366 --> 40:18.366
Yeah.

40:18.366 --> 40:19.766
Ethan talked you
out of it.

40:19.766 --> 40:21.766
No. No, it just...

40:21.766 --> 40:24.033
It... It wasn't
the right leap.

40:24.033 --> 40:25.433
Not right now,
not this book,

40:25.433 --> 40:28.466
but I'm happy
right where I am.

40:28.466 --> 40:29.566
Okay.

40:29.566 --> 40:31.400
Well, if you're happy
then I am happy.

40:31.400 --> 40:34.200
All I know is that I wanna
drink this thing, so...

40:34.200 --> 40:36.000
How about we
celebrate the fact

40:36.000 --> 40:38.333
that I am moving to L.A.

40:40.500 --> 40:41.333
What?

40:41.333 --> 40:42.733
I am so into
Rob, Erica.

40:42.733 --> 40:44.533
I just figure
I'll quit my job,

40:44.533 --> 40:45.766
hop on a plane,

40:45.766 --> 40:47.533
give it a shot.

40:49.100 --> 40:52.366
But... Jenny,
you barely know him.

40:52.366 --> 40:53.500
I know,

40:53.500 --> 40:56.766
but I have a really good
feeling about this.

40:56.766 --> 40:58.300
I just, I...

40:58.300 --> 40:59.333
What?

40:59.333 --> 41:01.266
I don't think it's a
good idea, Jenny,

41:01.266 --> 41:04.133
for you to pick up
and leave your whole life here

41:04.133 --> 41:06.100
for a guy
you don't even know.

41:06.100 --> 41:07.366
I mean, does Rob...

41:07.366 --> 41:09.166
Does he even know
about this?

41:09.166 --> 41:11.566
And where are you gonna live
when you get there?

41:11.566 --> 41:13.533
With Rob.

41:13.533 --> 41:17.500
Okay, but what if...
It doesn't work out?

41:18.600 --> 41:20.066
Then it doesn't.

41:20.066 --> 41:22.766
But at least I'll know
that I didn't chicken out.

41:25.633 --> 41:26.666
(stunned chuckle)

41:29.166 --> 41:30.000
That's unfair.

41:30.000 --> 41:31.400
Really?

41:31.400 --> 41:33.233
'cause you turned down
a book deal.

41:33.233 --> 41:34.200
No, no, actually,

41:34.200 --> 41:36.000
what you turned down
is your dream.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
Talk about a bad idea.

41:38.000 --> 41:39.733
My dream is to write
fiction

41:39.733 --> 41:41.333
and that will happen
some day;

41:41.333 --> 41:42.733
I am not letting that go.

41:42.733 --> 41:44.466
No, you're just letting
the opportunity

41:44.466 --> 41:46.400
to publish something
you wrote go.

41:46.400 --> 41:48.400
But you don't see me
attacking you.

41:48.400 --> 41:50.000
No. God, I'm not...
Listen, okay.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.200
I'm not attacking you,
I just care about you

41:52.200 --> 41:55.266
and I don't think that
moving to L.A. On a whim

41:55.266 --> 41:57.566
is going after
what you want.

41:57.566 --> 42:01.166
It's not a risk,
it's just reckless.

42:02.233 --> 42:03.566
Wow.

42:03.566 --> 42:06.000
This is what happens when
you get a boyfriend, huh?

42:06.000 --> 42:08.233
You become one of those,
those stuck up girls

42:08.233 --> 42:09.633
who thinks a safe,
boring life

42:09.633 --> 42:11.233
is the only way to go?

42:11.233 --> 42:13.033
That is not what
this is about.

42:13.033 --> 42:14.433
Jenny, I'm just
worried about you.

42:14.433 --> 42:15.433
Just spare me, okay?

42:15.433 --> 42:16.166
Come on.

42:16.166 --> 42:17.200
Keep the champagne.

42:17.200 --> 42:18.433
Hey, you know what?
Listen to me,

42:18.433 --> 42:20.233
and you're really not
gonna like this,

42:20.233 --> 42:22.266
but you think that you're
this big risk-taker,

42:22.266 --> 42:23.566
but you're not.

42:23.566 --> 42:25.700
Because you do the same thing
all the time with guys;

42:25.700 --> 42:28.100
you hook up with them
for a couple months

42:28.100 --> 42:29.500
and then you
break it off.

42:29.500 --> 42:32.500
I mean, you flying to L.A.,
it's not living on the edge,

42:32.500 --> 42:34.000
it's par for
the course.

42:34.000 --> 42:35.233
Honestly, Jenny,

42:35.233 --> 42:37.600
taking a risk, for you,
would be to take it slow.

42:37.600 --> 42:40.300
And for once,
to show this guy

42:41.000 --> 42:43.200
the side of Jenny
that the men you date,

42:43.200 --> 42:44.700
they never get to see.

42:44.700 --> 42:47.566
That would be taking
a risk.

42:54.200 --> 42:55.433
Erica: Risks.

42:55.433 --> 42:59.366
How we feel about them
says a lot about us.

43:03.533 --> 43:05.466
Every day, every moment

43:05.466 --> 43:07.333
we calculate and assess,

43:07.333 --> 43:09.333
debate and decide.

43:19.500 --> 43:21.533
But when you get
right down to it,

43:21.533 --> 43:23.766
the truth is, that when
it comes to risk,

43:23.766 --> 43:25.600
the only thing
that matters

43:25.600 --> 43:30.333
is that you take the ones
that are right for you.
