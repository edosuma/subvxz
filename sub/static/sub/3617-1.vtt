WEBVTT

00:04.548 --> 00:07.641
Okay, Piper, I can't be late
getting to the office today.

00:07.741 --> 00:10.316
I have a radio interview with
those morning guys, Pip and Skeeter.

00:10.416 --> 00:11.673
That's Skip and Peter.

00:11.773 --> 00:14.827
Could you forget about
your advice column for two seconds?

00:14.927 --> 00:16.542
Come see where
we're putting the nursery.

00:16.642 --> 00:18.778
You're putting it in your closet.
I've seen your closet.

00:18.878 --> 00:20.214
There's a lot of shoes, honey.

00:20.314 --> 00:21.931
No, not anymore.

00:22.031 --> 00:23.966
Look, it's perfect.

00:24.066 --> 00:26.062
It's a little cramped, though,
don't you think?

00:26.501 --> 00:28.476
That's why I'm adding a window,
to bring in light

00:28.576 --> 00:31.051
and create a sense of space.

00:31.969 --> 00:33.625
You guys are very cute.

00:33.725 --> 00:36.659
But why are you doing all this now?
Your due date's not for months.

00:36.759 --> 00:40.330
Well, demon activity has been light,
so it's a good time to get ahead.

00:40.430 --> 00:42.206
Speaking of ahead,

00:42.306 --> 00:45.360
I can't believe you guys didn't notice
my billboards downtown.

00:45.460 --> 00:48.233
Oh, honey, of course
we noticed them.

00:48.333 --> 00:51.786
You can see them
from a passing 747.

00:51.886 --> 00:53.423
We'd have told you
how proud we are,

00:53.523 --> 00:55.497
but you never slow down
to give us a chance.

00:55.597 --> 00:57.454
Well, you know,
nothing perks up a girl's career

00:57.554 --> 00:59.689
like sending her husband
straight to hell.

00:59.789 --> 01:02.881
Okay, well, I've seen the nursery,
and it's absolutely beautiful,

01:02.981 --> 01:04.798
but I really have to go
to that interview.

01:04.897 --> 01:07.871
Honey, I know your work
is very important to you.

01:07.971 --> 01:10.067
But guess what. I'm having a baby.

01:10.167 --> 01:11.384
I know.

01:11.484 --> 01:14.417
Yeah, so how about you take
a couple minutes to be Aunt Phoebe?

01:14.517 --> 01:16.452
Oh, my God, you're so right.

01:16.552 --> 01:19.446
I'm so sorry.
Okay, what do you need?

01:19.546 --> 01:21.542
An opinion.

01:22.141 --> 01:24.136
I'm thinking...

01:25.334 --> 01:27.608
Positions! Bogey in three, two, one!

01:37.068 --> 01:38.765
So much for the theory
that Borneo demons

01:38.865 --> 01:40.400
are impervious to magical powers.

01:40.500 --> 01:42.356
I can't wait to tell
the local witch doctors.

01:42.456 --> 01:45.310
Excuse me, can we refrain from
blowing up demons in the nursery?

01:45.410 --> 01:47.446
Oh, honey, it was just one.

01:47.765 --> 01:49.062
Piper, you're going to be a mom.

01:49.162 --> 01:51.397
You need to start thinking
about the safety of our daughter.

01:53.752 --> 01:56.087
And you, you're getting so caught up
with this magical kick.

01:56.187 --> 01:59.040
Look at your hair. It's still red
from the potion you blew up last night.

01:59.140 --> 02:01.894
Do you have any idea how much
this would cost in a salon?

02:02.653 --> 02:05.307
I love your new 'do, honey.
I think you look beautiful.

02:05.407 --> 02:06.823
Okay, bye.

02:06.923 --> 02:08.180
Thank you.

02:08.280 --> 02:09.857
Honey, sweets, toots?

02:09.957 --> 02:11.812
I appreciate that you're
very concerned,

02:11.912 --> 02:13.250
but I am still a witch,

02:13.350 --> 02:17.161
and we do still have innocents
to protect and demons to fight.

02:17.261 --> 02:19.257
I can't just crawl in a hole.

02:25.204 --> 02:28.416
It's too bad, Mylie,
but your time is up.

02:28.516 --> 02:33.865
You had 30 days to find love
or the penalty would be death.

02:35.102 --> 02:37.956
But he does love me.
I know he does.

02:38.056 --> 02:39.592
Oh, really?

02:39.692 --> 02:40.789
Did he tell you?

02:40.889 --> 02:43.065
He doesn't have to tell me
he loves me.

02:43.165 --> 02:45.799
Well, actually, he does.

02:46.397 --> 02:49.212
But he'll never say he loves you
until he trusts you.

02:49.312 --> 02:54.360
And he'll never trust you
until you tell him what you really are.

02:54.460 --> 02:57.294
You see why I always
win these bargains.

02:58.013 --> 03:03.700
As an immortal being, I'm afraid
only you can give up your life.

03:03.800 --> 03:07.313
Place this auger shell
over your heart.

03:07.791 --> 03:12.381
It will draw your immortality inside.

03:14.377 --> 03:15.474
And if I don't?

03:15.574 --> 03:19.486
Then you can rot for eternity
right here.

03:33.535 --> 03:36.389
You're wrong. He does love me.

03:36.489 --> 03:38.565
And I'm gonna prove it.

04:23.028 --> 04:27.918
Leo, I can't believe you found
all our old baby stuff.

04:28.018 --> 04:30.652
Grams was a bit of a pack rat.

04:31.569 --> 04:33.266
Baby book.

04:33.366 --> 04:35.820
My baby book.

04:35.920 --> 04:38.475
Oh, look how squishy I was.

04:39.193 --> 04:41.289
You were so adorable.

04:41.389 --> 04:43.284
Leo, you can't even see the picture.

04:43.384 --> 04:45.120
I'm your whitelighter.

04:45.220 --> 04:47.934
I've been watching you
ever since you were a baby.

04:48.573 --> 04:50.769
Yeah, see, that's too creepy
to think about.

04:52.364 --> 04:54.660
I never knew that Mom
kept a baby book for me.

04:54.760 --> 04:58.092
Why not? I mean,
you started one for our daughter.

04:58.192 --> 05:01.385
I always thought you
and your mom were a lot alike.

05:04.738 --> 05:06.833
It's strange to think that
she went through everything

05:06.933 --> 05:08.230
I'm going through right now.

05:08.330 --> 05:11.064
I don't think you ever really know
how much your mother loves you

05:11.164 --> 05:13.160
until you become one yourself.

05:18.907 --> 05:21.382
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

05:22.499 --> 05:24.595
Here.

05:24.695 --> 05:27.409
- Why don't you let me help you?
- It's heavy.

05:28.088 --> 05:31.181
Well, see, that's kind of why
I wanted to help you with it.

05:31.281 --> 05:34.174
Piper, when are you gonna
accept the fact that you're pregnant?

05:34.274 --> 05:36.329
When are you gonna stop
being so overprotective?

05:36.429 --> 05:38.963
All I'm suggesting
is that you slow down.

05:39.063 --> 05:41.159
Okay, Leo, I'm not gonna be
one of those women

05:41.259 --> 05:44.910
that sits on her ass and eats bonbons
throughout her entire pregnancy.

05:45.010 --> 05:46.707
That's just not the woman
you married.

05:46.807 --> 05:49.221
Besides, generations
of Halliwell women

05:49.321 --> 05:52.016
raised perfectly normal children
before me.

05:52.116 --> 05:54.111
They all got through it, and so will I.

05:54.750 --> 05:56.246
Not all of them.

05:56.346 --> 05:57.883
What's that supposed to mean?

05:57.983 --> 05:59.978
How far along in the book
have you gotten?

06:10.595 --> 06:13.230
There was no one there to finish it
after your mother died.

06:21.571 --> 06:23.567
Like I said,
you're a lot like your mother.

06:24.365 --> 06:26.301
She was careless too.

06:26.401 --> 06:28.875
She thought she was invincible.

06:30.312 --> 06:32.308
She was wrong.

06:43.563 --> 06:47.016
Hello. Begging your evil pardon.

06:47.116 --> 06:49.750
I bear a message from my master.

06:50.629 --> 06:52.125
Necron?

06:52.225 --> 06:55.039
He wants the immortality
you promised him,

06:55.139 --> 06:56.714
and he wants it now!

06:56.814 --> 06:59.070
His words, not mine.

06:59.170 --> 07:03.460
Tell your master he'll get what
he wants, but he must be patient.

07:03.560 --> 07:05.177
Oh, no.

07:05.277 --> 07:07.133
I can't tell him that.

07:07.233 --> 07:12.641
No disrespect, but skeletal beings
aren't known for their patience.

07:12.741 --> 07:15.235
Then you best hurry along.

07:15.335 --> 07:17.669
I'll do as you ask.

07:17.769 --> 07:22.918
But it'll be the last thing I do
before Necron eats my life force.

07:24.515 --> 07:26.511
Then comes for yours.

07:36.090 --> 07:37.546
<i>Water</i>

07:37.646 --> 07:40.580
<i>Rise up from the sea</i>

07:40.680 --> 07:43.553
<i>Find the one who fled from me</i>

07:43.873 --> 07:47.405
<i>Follow where the winds are cold</i>

07:47.505 --> 07:52.135
<i>Then fall tenfold like days of old</i>

08:12.131 --> 08:14.147
Mylie.

08:14.247 --> 08:17.141
- Mylie, hey.
- Hey.

08:17.241 --> 08:18.977
I'm so sorry to pull you out
of your meeting.

08:19.077 --> 08:21.152
They said it was important.
What's going on?

08:21.591 --> 08:23.587
I need to know
how you feel about me.

08:25.742 --> 08:26.919
What's so funny?

08:27.019 --> 08:29.015
- You know what I love?
- No, what?

08:29.773 --> 08:31.929
Your enthusiasm.

08:32.885 --> 08:34.582
What else?

08:34.683 --> 08:39.273
Well, l... I love this dimple
right here when you smile.

08:41.707 --> 08:43.703
Mylie, what's going on here?

08:45.020 --> 08:50.029
Look, I told you, I need to know
how you feel about me deep inside.

08:50.129 --> 08:51.506
It's important.

08:51.606 --> 08:54.260
Well, listen, I'm gonna be on a plane
in two hours to go to New York.

08:54.360 --> 08:55.737
When I get back, we'll go out...

08:55.837 --> 08:58.591
No, before you get on the plane.

08:59.110 --> 09:00.686
I can't explain right now,

09:00.786 --> 09:04.060
but unless you tell me
how you feel about me,

09:04.618 --> 09:06.614
I may not be here
when you get back.

09:07.332 --> 09:08.628
What's that supposed to mean?

09:08.728 --> 09:11.224
I'm sorry, this isn't a threat.

09:11.324 --> 09:13.139
It just... It is what it is.

09:13.239 --> 09:15.614
Look, Mylie, this isn't the time
or the place for this.

09:15.714 --> 09:18.008
Whatever I feel for you
should come out when I'm ready.

09:18.108 --> 09:20.104
But we're running out of time.

09:22.858 --> 09:27.987
Look, Craig, I admit that
this isn't fair, what I'm asking you.

09:28.087 --> 09:33.715
But it's what I need right now
if you want to keep me in your life.

09:36.149 --> 09:37.566
Okay.

09:37.666 --> 09:41.059
If it's that important, okay.

09:42.496 --> 09:44.492
When I first met you...

09:45.729 --> 09:47.585
...I felt a wall come down.

09:47.685 --> 09:49.800
A wall around my heart.

09:54.150 --> 09:56.844
I mean, I don't know
how to say this, but...

09:56.944 --> 09:58.561
- I gotta go.
- What?

09:58.661 --> 10:01.176
- Wait a minute, you just...
- I'm so sorry. I've gotta go.

10:46.716 --> 10:48.093
Matthews!

10:48.193 --> 10:50.589
In my office, now!

10:54.580 --> 10:57.753
Weather advisory: If you're gonna
go outside, bring a paddle.

10:57.853 --> 10:59.349
Where were you?

10:59.449 --> 11:01.744
I had to run the McKenzie papers
over to the courthouse.

11:01.844 --> 11:03.221
You've been gone an hour.

11:03.321 --> 11:06.014
Yeah, well, there's a freak rainstorm.
The entire city's flooded.

11:06.114 --> 11:08.210
You should've let someone know
where you're headed.

11:08.310 --> 11:10.924
You have this habit
of coming and going as you please.

11:11.024 --> 11:12.281
As I please?

11:12.381 --> 11:15.314
No, I come and go
as other people please.

11:15.414 --> 11:18.707
That's what assistants do.
They run errands.

11:18.807 --> 11:21.621
I'll tell you a little secret.
They don't like it.

11:21.721 --> 11:23.297
Well, your behaviour
has got to change.

11:23.397 --> 11:25.732
Maybe it'll change if you promote me
to social worker.

11:25.832 --> 11:27.828
I already did.

11:28.306 --> 11:30.302
You start tomorrow.

11:31.379 --> 11:32.956
He promoted you?

11:33.056 --> 11:34.832
Congratulations.

11:34.932 --> 11:37.227
- Thanks, I guess.
- What do you mean, you guess?

11:37.327 --> 11:39.682
Paige, you've worked
so hard for this. It's your dream.

11:40.240 --> 11:42.496
Yeah, Cowan already gave me
the big responsibility speech.

11:42.596 --> 11:45.130
No more coming to work late,
no more long lunches.

11:45.230 --> 11:46.327
<i>Hold on a second, sweetie.</i>

11:46.427 --> 11:47.963
Nancy O'Dell's producer's
on the phone.

11:48.063 --> 11:49.880
They want to know
if you want hair and makeup.

11:49.980 --> 11:51.756
No, I will do my own. Thanks.

11:51.856 --> 11:53.591
- Hi.
- Nancy O'Dell?

11:53.691 --> 11:56.506
Yeah, she wants to interview me
on TV tomorrow.

11:56.606 --> 11:59.937
Look at you, blowing up around town.
Billboards, radio, TV.

12:00.037 --> 12:01.774
What's next?
Phoebe, the world tour?

12:01.874 --> 12:04.927
Oh, no, even better.

12:05.027 --> 12:06.923
<i>- Divorce court.</i>
<i>- What?</i>

12:07.023 --> 12:10.515
I can't believe you found time
to push a divorce through the system.

12:10.615 --> 12:12.670
I just want my life back.

12:12.770 --> 12:14.546
I don't want to have to look
over my shoulder,

12:14.646 --> 12:16.302
praying that Cole
isn't gonna find a way

12:16.402 --> 12:18.098
out of the demonic wasteland,
you know?

12:18.198 --> 12:19.934
<i>- Do you think he will?</i>
<i>- You know what?</i>

12:20.034 --> 12:22.489
I don't care.
Because even if he does,

12:22.589 --> 12:25.782
after today, I'll be free.

12:41.747 --> 12:44.660
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

12:45.140 --> 12:48.233
It's just that I recognize you
from your billboard.

12:48.333 --> 12:50.587
- I need your help.
- Oh, that's sweet, sweetie.

12:50.687 --> 12:52.983
But if you write a letter,
then I respond to everyone.

12:53.083 --> 12:55.079
No, you don't understand.

12:55.717 --> 12:57.892
I recognized you
as a Charmed One.

12:57.992 --> 13:00.407
You're very famous
where I come from.

13:00.507 --> 13:02.123
I'm not evil or anything.

13:02.223 --> 13:04.817
- I've heard that one before.
- No, honestly.

13:17.350 --> 13:19.445
- We need to go.
- Well, yeah!

13:19.545 --> 13:20.762
The Sea Hag can track my tail.

13:20.862 --> 13:23.058
- Well, then make it go away.
- I can't.

13:39.782 --> 13:43.015
All right. Okay.

13:52.833 --> 13:54.829
Okay, hang on!

14:14.387 --> 14:17.958
Okay, I just cut work on the day
of my big promotion

14:18.058 --> 14:19.715
and sped through a rainstorm
to get here.

14:19.815 --> 14:23.905
- What is the 911?
- Phoebe found a mermaid.

14:24.005 --> 14:25.542
Actually, she found me.

14:25.642 --> 14:28.256
On the way to a very important
court date, I might add.

14:28.356 --> 14:30.052
Hi, I'm Mylie.

14:30.152 --> 14:31.489
You must be Paige.

14:31.589 --> 14:33.585
You have a very big
underwater fan base.

14:34.024 --> 14:37.915
You're a mermaid?
You guys actually exist?

14:38.015 --> 14:41.348
Excuse me,
when you said Sea Hag,

14:41.448 --> 14:44.422
did you mean like old-woman hag
or evil-magic hag?

14:44.522 --> 14:47.236
Because, see, I'm not really
in the battle mood today.

14:48.073 --> 14:50.069
She's kind of both.

14:50.588 --> 14:52.444
Forget that,
what's life like under the sea?

14:52.544 --> 14:54.719
Does your skin get wrinkly?

14:54.819 --> 14:57.313
Does algae pose
a personal-hygiene problem?

14:57.413 --> 14:59.907
Okay, guys, why don't we
let her up for a little air?

15:00.007 --> 15:01.304
No, it's okay, I don't mind.

15:01.404 --> 15:03.340
Actually, there's nothing like
being a mermaid.

15:03.440 --> 15:07.171
You get to swim in the open sea
all day, explore endless wonders.

15:07.271 --> 15:09.367
- It's pure freedom.
- Sounds like heaven.

15:09.467 --> 15:11.881
I'm sure you wanna get back.
I can drop you off at the beach...

15:11.981 --> 15:13.079
No, you don't understand.

15:13.179 --> 15:16.771
It was a great life
for the first few hundred years.

15:19.086 --> 15:20.384
Mermaids are immortal.

15:20.484 --> 15:23.098
Yeah, we can spend eternity at sea.

15:23.198 --> 15:27.248
Because our hearts are, well,
some say, as cold as the water.

15:27.348 --> 15:30.002
But sometimes
a mermaid gets Ionely,

15:30.102 --> 15:33.435
and her heart warms,
and she wants more.

15:33.535 --> 15:35.151
Is that what happened to you?

15:35.251 --> 15:38.903
The ocean's floor is littered with bones
of mortals who died for love.

15:39.003 --> 15:40.619
I had to know why.

15:40.719 --> 15:43.273
Now, these bones,

15:43.912 --> 15:47.385
could they be bones of mortals
that perhaps the Sea Hag killed?

15:47.704 --> 15:49.360
- Piper.
- What?

15:49.460 --> 15:52.673
So you said you wanted to feel love.
Is that why you saw the Sea Hag?

15:52.773 --> 15:56.864
Yes. If a mortal professes his love
to a mermaid, she becomes human.

15:56.964 --> 15:58.820
The Sea Hag agreed to give me legs,

15:58.920 --> 16:00.696
but if I didn't find love
before her deadline,

16:00.796 --> 16:02.691
I would have to give her
my immortality.

16:02.791 --> 16:04.527
All that for a guy?

16:04.627 --> 16:06.404
Boy, did you get taken for a ride.

16:06.504 --> 16:07.561
- Phoebe.
- What?

16:07.661 --> 16:09.657
But I did find love.

16:09.976 --> 16:12.171
I mean, I think I did.

16:12.890 --> 16:16.522
But I might be dead
before I get to find out for sure.

16:17.958 --> 16:19.954
Craig's getting on a plane
to New York soon.

16:20.354 --> 16:22.329
Oh, no, no, no. This is good.

16:22.429 --> 16:24.245
Because all we gotta do
is find the fish lover,

16:24.345 --> 16:27.158
get him to spill his guts, and then
we don't have to face the Sea Hag.

16:27.258 --> 16:28.555
- Piper.
- What?

16:28.655 --> 16:30.950
If your boyfriend's love
can make you human,

16:31.050 --> 16:33.046
why don't you just tell him
you're a mermaid?

16:33.525 --> 16:35.221
You mean that I'm a genetic freak

16:35.321 --> 16:37.616
with a fish tail
coated in glandular slime?

16:37.716 --> 16:40.210
- She raises a good point.
- Yeah.

16:40.310 --> 16:42.086
You may be half fish,
but you're still a woman.

16:42.186 --> 16:44.600
And women, you know, they generally
know when a man's in love

16:44.700 --> 16:45.878
even before he does.

16:45.978 --> 16:47.793
Oh, please.

16:47.893 --> 16:51.167
If I wrote that slop in my column,
I'd be driven out of town.

16:51.486 --> 16:55.118
Okay, that is it.
Can I see you two in the kitchen?

16:58.710 --> 17:00.686
Okay, what is going on
with you guys?

17:00.786 --> 17:02.921
I'm sorry. Like you need a man
to be complete.

17:03.021 --> 17:05.993
That kind of thinking dates back
to the days we all had tails.

17:06.094 --> 17:07.151
Maybe Phoebe's right.

17:07.251 --> 17:09.227
Maybe we just throw the mermaid
back into the ocean

17:09.327 --> 17:10.784
and we keep the manor
a hag-free zone.

17:10.884 --> 17:12.101
Who are you people,

17:12.201 --> 17:14.454
and what have you done
with my sisters?

17:14.555 --> 17:16.611
Let's start with you.
What is going on in that head?

17:16.711 --> 17:18.807
I keep thinking about
the court date I'm missing.

17:18.906 --> 17:20.801
Okay, so you're dumping
all over our innocent?

17:20.902 --> 17:22.398
I don't mean to be.

17:22.499 --> 17:25.112
Paige, I've been fighting so hard
to get my life back.

17:25.212 --> 17:27.228
If Cole shows up
and we're still married,

17:27.328 --> 17:29.025
then it was all for nothing.

17:29.125 --> 17:30.382
I need my freedom.

17:30.482 --> 17:31.938
Okay, fine, go meet the judge.

17:32.038 --> 17:34.033
Just hurry back,
and we'll deal with Mylie.

17:38.305 --> 17:39.562
Where's she going?

17:39.662 --> 17:41.079
Everything okay?

17:41.179 --> 17:43.034
Yeah, Piper and I
were just about to discuss

17:43.134 --> 17:44.392
how best to vanquish
the Sea Hag.

17:44.492 --> 17:46.706
No, you said we were
gonna deal with Mylie.

17:46.806 --> 17:49.220
You didn't say anything about
doing anything with the Sea Hag.

17:49.320 --> 17:50.737
What is up with you

17:50.837 --> 17:53.332
and these demon-avoidance issues
you've suddenly got?

17:53.432 --> 17:55.247
I think if we can protect Mylie

17:55.347 --> 17:58.201
and avoid a run-in with the Sea Hag,
I'm all for that.

17:58.301 --> 17:59.877
What is going on with everybody?

17:59.977 --> 18:01.753
We're talking about the Sea Hag,

18:01.853 --> 18:03.390
mysterious monster
of the deep blue sea,

18:03.490 --> 18:05.824
whose name strikes fear
in the hearts of sailors everywhere.

18:05.924 --> 18:08.458
Okay, somebody's been watching
way too much Discovery Channel.

18:08.558 --> 18:10.974
You're probably right,
but she's an interesting evil specimen.

18:11.074 --> 18:13.448
<i>Reminds me of this water demon</i>
<i>I read about in the Book.</i>

18:13.548 --> 18:15.284
She kills in the most
fascinating way.

18:15.384 --> 18:17.619
- Paige.
- What?

18:19.215 --> 18:21.211
We know how it kills.

18:23.646 --> 18:25.142
What'd I say?

18:25.242 --> 18:27.238
It killed Mom.

18:29.633 --> 18:31.050
It's okay, you didn't know.

18:31.150 --> 18:32.766
Look, I just don't see any sense

18:32.866 --> 18:36.299
in going up against a demon like this
if we don't have to.

18:37.656 --> 18:40.989
Okay, maybe we can get Craig
to confess his love for Mylie.

18:41.089 --> 18:42.386
I'll ask her what flight he's on,

18:42.486 --> 18:44.820
and maybe I can stop him
from getting on that plane.

18:44.920 --> 18:46.297
But if it doesn't work,

18:46.397 --> 18:49.090
we're gonna have to come up with
a plan B to vanquish the Sea Hag.

18:49.190 --> 18:51.466
<i>I know. I will check</i>
<i>the Book of Shadows.</i>

18:57.333 --> 18:59.229
You okay?

18:59.329 --> 19:01.324
Yeah.

19:07.431 --> 19:10.904
Hello, begging your evil pardon.

19:11.263 --> 19:13.258
I see you're still alive.

19:21.641 --> 19:26.470
Six months ago,
I came to this cavern to feed on you.

19:27.109 --> 19:29.344
You talked me out of it.

19:29.703 --> 19:31.040
What was it you said?

19:31.140 --> 19:33.873
I promised you an immortal being

19:33.973 --> 19:36.409
to give you permanent
and everlasting life.

19:36.888 --> 19:38.983
Yes. That was it.

19:39.083 --> 19:41.079
A mermaid, I believe.

19:41.597 --> 19:43.593
Did you capture her for me?

19:44.870 --> 19:46.906
No. Not yet.

19:50.458 --> 19:51.954
It's not too late.

19:52.054 --> 19:53.391
I can cast a new spell,

19:53.491 --> 19:56.126
conjure a storm like
San Francisco has never seen.

19:56.724 --> 19:58.840
Think what you're giving up
if you kill me.

20:03.710 --> 20:05.705
Now, this isn't right.

20:19.116 --> 20:22.708
I'm so tired of feeding
on lower life-forms.

20:23.028 --> 20:25.562
The mermaid
won't get away this time.

20:25.662 --> 20:27.078
She better not.

20:27.178 --> 20:29.174
For your sake.

20:34.682 --> 20:39.970
<i>Flight 83 to Palm Beach, Florida</i>
<i>will be boarding in 15 minutes.</i>

20:40.070 --> 20:45.739
<i>Flight 83 to Palm Beach, Florida</i>
<i>will be boarding in 15 minutes.</i>

20:46.656 --> 20:49.929
Thank you, Mr. Wilson.
Have a nice flight.

20:50.567 --> 20:52.463
Craig? Craig Wilson?

20:52.563 --> 20:54.060
- Yeah?
- I have a message for you.

20:54.160 --> 20:55.696
Mylie sent me.

20:55.796 --> 20:57.851
Let me guess,
she sent me a singing telegram.

20:57.951 --> 21:01.084
No, no, a stripagram,
that's more Mylie's style.

21:01.184 --> 21:03.240
Shocking and unexpected.

21:03.340 --> 21:04.397
I'm a friend of Mylie's.

21:04.497 --> 21:06.693
She sent me here
because she needs to speak with you.

21:07.211 --> 21:09.027
Why didn't she come herself?

21:09.127 --> 21:10.464
That's a good question.

21:10.564 --> 21:13.578
There's a good answer,
I just can't tell you what it is.

21:13.678 --> 21:14.895
But it's good.

21:14.995 --> 21:17.090
Let me get this straight.
You're a friend of Mylie's.

21:17.190 --> 21:18.886
I've never met you,
never even heard of you,

21:18.986 --> 21:20.442
and you know more about her
than I do?

21:20.542 --> 21:23.675
No, not more about her
than you do, just a little secret.

21:23.775 --> 21:25.751
Well, a big secret.

21:25.851 --> 21:27.348
Well, I'm tired of Mylie's secrets.

21:27.448 --> 21:30.162
Okay, I'm tired of her moving closer
to me, and then running away and...

21:31.279 --> 21:32.616
I'm just tired.

21:32.716 --> 21:34.452
There's a really good reason
for all of this,

21:34.552 --> 21:37.086
and one day you guys are gonna
sit down at a nice seafood dinner

21:37.186 --> 21:40.719
and laugh about this, but until then,
you really need to trust her.

21:40.819 --> 21:43.233
No, right now, I need to catch a plane.
Excuse me.

21:43.333 --> 21:46.367
Craig, her life is in danger.

21:52.753 --> 21:56.764
I sent a sheriff to his apartment,
to his work, even his dry cleaners.

21:56.864 --> 21:58.999
Trust me, Your Honour,
I didn't make a good faith effort

21:59.099 --> 22:00.796
to try to notify my husband
of our divorce,

22:00.896 --> 22:02.471
I made a great faith effort.

22:02.571 --> 22:05.186
But to grant a default divorce,

22:05.286 --> 22:08.060
the court requires that you
put a notice in the local newspaper

22:08.160 --> 22:10.934
saying where the missing spouse
was last residing.

22:11.034 --> 22:12.490
Did you do that?

22:12.590 --> 22:15.404
I made the notice
larger than legally required.

22:15.504 --> 22:18.238
I even used a 12-pica bold font
to make sure it really popped.

22:18.338 --> 22:21.211
You see there how it really pops?

22:22.968 --> 22:24.744
What is your business here,
inspector?

22:24.844 --> 22:28.216
I led the investigation into
the disappearance of Mr. Cole Turner.

22:28.316 --> 22:31.009
We used every method at our
disposal to locate his whereabouts,

22:31.109 --> 22:32.966
and we still came up empty.

22:33.066 --> 22:35.261
It's my belief that Mr. Turner
has left the country.

22:36.059 --> 22:37.715
I must say, young lady,

22:37.815 --> 22:39.272
in all my years on the bench,

22:39.372 --> 22:42.266
I have never seen a divorce
pushed through this fast.

22:42.366 --> 22:44.362
Please sign here.

22:45.758 --> 22:48.432
- Free at last.
- Is this the right office?

22:49.869 --> 22:51.865
Cole Turner, Your Honour.

22:52.264 --> 22:55.377
Nice ad.
Thanks for letting me know.

22:56.654 --> 22:59.348
You evil bastard. Why didn't you
just stay where you belong?

22:59.448 --> 23:00.865
Wait a minute, I'm not evil.

23:00.965 --> 23:03.300
Do you have any idea
what you just did to me in there?

23:03.400 --> 23:05.934
Hold on. I'm not evil. I'm good.

23:06.034 --> 23:08.130
You're good at crushing
my every hope and dream.

23:08.230 --> 23:09.527
Well, I'm gonna make up for that.

23:09.627 --> 23:11.442
Made me look like a fool
in front of the judge.

23:11.542 --> 23:13.997
You are like a pit bull
with a death grip.

23:14.097 --> 23:16.092
You know,
I should arrest you on principle.

23:20.882 --> 23:22.179
Too many people talking at once.

23:22.279 --> 23:25.012
You see, Cole, this is
exactly what I'm talking about.

23:25.112 --> 23:27.966
Good people don't turn other people
into water coolers.

23:28.066 --> 23:29.882
- I needed you to hear me.
- Go to hell.

23:29.982 --> 23:31.838
I was just there.
I didn't mean to stay so long,

23:31.938 --> 23:33.833
but I needed to gather
enough powers to execute...

23:33.933 --> 23:36.428
Execute who, huh? Execute who?

23:36.528 --> 23:39.302
My plan. I'm here to redeem myself.

23:39.402 --> 23:41.138
You better be careful.

23:41.238 --> 23:45.089
You are stepping down
a very dangerous road right now.

23:45.189 --> 23:47.324
I'm already on it.

23:47.424 --> 23:49.160
I got my job back at the law firm.

23:49.260 --> 23:52.014
I'm gonna use my powers
to help people.

23:53.052 --> 23:54.709
Make up for my past.

23:54.809 --> 23:56.226
You'll see we're meant to be together.

23:56.326 --> 23:59.119
Cole, if you say that again,
I swear I'll scream.

24:00.317 --> 24:02.591
I want you out of my life.

24:03.150 --> 24:04.767
I'll keep my distance.

24:04.867 --> 24:06.802
But I'm not going away.

24:06.902 --> 24:08.898
My love for you hasn't changed.

24:09.377 --> 24:11.911
It kept me alive in the wasteland...

24:12.011 --> 24:14.007
...and led me back to you.

24:16.162 --> 24:18.258
You won't use that.

24:18.358 --> 24:21.591
I know you still love me,
on some level, deep inside.

24:26.939 --> 24:30.830
You are seriously mistaken
if you think I still love you in any way.

24:30.930 --> 24:32.266
I wasn't expecting a warm welcome,

24:32.366 --> 24:35.321
but don't you think
this is a little extreme?

24:42.665 --> 24:44.760
Wait.

24:44.860 --> 24:46.436
You stay away from me,

24:46.536 --> 24:48.532
whatever you are.

24:57.393 --> 24:59.388
What happened?

24:59.907 --> 25:01.763
Where's Phoebe?

25:01.863 --> 25:03.858
She ran off.

25:04.857 --> 25:07.211
You're lucky that's all she did.

25:11.243 --> 25:14.695
<i>Pounding the coastline</i>
<i>and leaving weary residents...</i>

25:14.795 --> 25:16.531
<i>Now, the Book says</i>
<i>that the Sea Hag</i>

25:16.631 --> 25:18.726
has power over
her natural environment.

25:18.826 --> 25:22.478
Would that be, like, rainstorms?

25:22.578 --> 25:26.291
- Yeah, rainstorms, hurricanes.
- Hurricanes?

25:26.649 --> 25:28.465
Even tidal waves.

25:28.565 --> 25:31.299
Leo, she said tidal waves.
How far do tidal waves travel?

25:31.399 --> 25:33.335
Excuse us.

25:33.435 --> 25:35.410
What has gotten into you?

25:35.510 --> 25:38.005
I don't know.
I just don't feel like myself.

25:38.105 --> 25:40.319
Well, our job is
to keep the innocent calm.

25:40.419 --> 25:42.156
Can you do that
while I go talk to the Elders

25:42.256 --> 25:44.072
and see if they
can help control the Sea Hag?

25:44.172 --> 25:46.167
Sure.

25:51.994 --> 25:53.690
Hey.

25:53.790 --> 25:54.888
You came.

25:54.988 --> 25:57.303
Yeah, Paige told me your life
was in danger. What's going on?

25:57.981 --> 26:00.157
I really need to know
how you feel about me.

26:00.257 --> 26:03.270
I can't believe we're back on this.
What, you two in on this joke, or what?

26:03.370 --> 26:05.584
It's no joke. You have to tell her
how you feel about her.

26:05.684 --> 26:07.261
Her life depends on it.

26:07.361 --> 26:10.035
What is this?
The Delusional Girls' Club? Come on.

26:11.113 --> 26:12.690
Tell me what's happening.

26:12.790 --> 26:15.544
- I can't.
- You can't?

26:16.461 --> 26:17.998
You yank me out
of a business meeting,

26:18.098 --> 26:20.074
you have your friend ambush me
at the airport,

26:20.174 --> 26:22.888
I miss my plane,
and you can't tell me why?

26:23.725 --> 26:24.823
No.

26:24.923 --> 26:27.896
Okay, buddy, look. You obviously
wouldn't be here if you didn't care.

26:27.996 --> 26:31.209
So why don't you just tell her
that you love her, for crying out loud.

26:31.309 --> 26:32.366
- Piper, relax.
- What?

26:32.466 --> 26:35.340
If he does not do this,
then we gotta fight the evil...

26:37.136 --> 26:38.713
Person.

26:38.813 --> 26:40.849
- Know what, I'm out of here.
- Craig, wait!

26:44.042 --> 26:46.556
You want to know
what I'm hiding from you?

26:47.594 --> 26:49.590
Okay.

26:50.707 --> 26:52.703
Mylie.

26:53.022 --> 26:55.017
No, don't!

27:00.925 --> 27:03.000
Please don't be afraid.

27:03.600 --> 27:05.595
It's still me.

27:05.994 --> 27:08.190
What are you?

27:20.961 --> 27:22.958
Did you find a vanquishing spell?

27:25.751 --> 27:27.747
Piper, freeze her!

27:29.543 --> 27:31.539
I can't.

27:45.229 --> 27:47.204
Piper!

27:47.304 --> 27:50.397
Piper, help me! Piper!

27:50.497 --> 27:52.493
Help!

27:59.398 --> 28:01.394
What happened to you?

28:15.842 --> 28:19.055
She took our innocent?
How could you let that happen?

28:19.155 --> 28:22.488
I don't know.
I think I had a panic attack.

28:22.588 --> 28:24.584
I couldn't breathe or move.

28:24.942 --> 28:26.599
Okay, but she took our innocent.

28:26.699 --> 28:28.076
Let's give Piper a break, okay?

28:28.176 --> 28:32.108
No, she's right. I froze up.
Mylie's gone, and it's my fault.

28:32.208 --> 28:34.981
No, it's not your fault.
It's your hormones.

28:35.081 --> 28:36.936
Your maternal instincts
are kicking in.

28:37.036 --> 28:38.173
More like taking over.

28:38.273 --> 28:41.367
It's natural for a mother
to feel protective of her baby.

28:41.467 --> 28:43.842
But she's been handling demons
ever since she got pregnant.

28:43.942 --> 28:45.359
Why the sudden change today?

28:45.459 --> 28:47.194
I don't know. I just...

28:47.294 --> 28:49.290
I don't.

28:49.649 --> 28:52.363
Let's just focus on finding Mylie.
What'd you get on the Sea Hag?

28:53.162 --> 28:56.394
There's a vanquishing spell,
power of three.

28:56.794 --> 28:58.790
I have it somewhere.

28:59.468 --> 29:00.765
Okay, what about a location?

29:00.865 --> 29:02.861
<i>Did the Book say</i>
<i>where we could find her?</i>

29:05.335 --> 29:08.288
The Elders say she keeps
a cavern on a remote island.

29:09.007 --> 29:10.943
She keeps it hidden
with charms and spells.

29:11.043 --> 29:13.038
The only way to track her
is with a mermaid.

29:13.398 --> 29:15.334
Well, unfortunately,
we're fresh out of those.

29:15.434 --> 29:18.267
Okay, yeah, well, where were you
when this all went down?

29:20.622 --> 29:22.278
I had my own demon to deal with.

29:22.378 --> 29:25.232
The good news is, is that the Sea Hag
can't steal Mylie's immortality

29:25.332 --> 29:26.828
unless she's willing to give it up.

29:26.928 --> 29:28.425
Which could be any minute.

29:28.525 --> 29:31.618
It's true. If she gives up hope,
she might wanna die.

29:31.718 --> 29:33.295
Well, I'll find Craig.
We may need him.

29:33.395 --> 29:35.390
Try the airport.
He was headed to New York.

29:38.543 --> 29:40.539
I'll try to locate the Sea Hag.

29:40.859 --> 29:42.854
Oh, honey.

29:43.692 --> 29:45.269
I'm sorry.

29:45.369 --> 29:47.543
I might have been pushing too hard.

29:47.643 --> 29:49.839
Why don't you let me and Paige
worry about the Sea Hag?

29:50.717 --> 29:53.171
- No, this I've got to...
- Rest.

29:53.271 --> 29:55.846
If not for your sake,
then for my niece.

29:55.946 --> 29:58.041
All this stress can't be good.

29:58.141 --> 30:00.137
She's right.

30:12.709 --> 30:15.444
I underestimated you.

30:15.544 --> 30:18.038
They always come back to me
with empty hearts,

30:18.138 --> 30:20.512
begging me to end their lives.

30:20.612 --> 30:22.608
But you...

30:25.362 --> 30:27.358
You almost found love.

30:27.916 --> 30:29.453
I did find love.

30:29.553 --> 30:31.648
Maybe he did love you.

30:31.748 --> 30:34.442
But I'm afraid that's over,
my dear child,

30:34.542 --> 30:36.538
now that he knows what you are.

30:39.730 --> 30:43.243
It's time to embrace your fate.

30:48.990 --> 30:52.303
The pain you're feeling
won't go away.

30:53.980 --> 30:56.793
As an immortal creature...

30:56.893 --> 31:00.606
...can you bear to live with it
for eternity?

31:11.861 --> 31:13.398
Inspector 43 in need of assistance.

31:13.498 --> 31:16.151
216 in progress. I have shots fired.

31:16.251 --> 31:19.325
<i>Ten-four.</i>
<i>Inspector 43 requesting backup.</i>

31:19.884 --> 31:23.117
Last time I come to this place
for lunch.

31:37.925 --> 31:40.160
Thought you could use a little help.

31:40.878 --> 31:42.495
You thought right.

31:42.595 --> 31:44.750
Let's go get the bad guy.

31:45.628 --> 31:48.362
- What did you do?
- Gave us a little extra time.

31:48.462 --> 31:50.317
Yeah, I can see that. Why?

31:50.417 --> 31:52.153
You mean, other than
to save your ass?

31:52.253 --> 31:55.227
Well, I need to show Phoebe
that I am good.

31:55.327 --> 31:57.542
I help you make this collar,
you look good to your bosses.

31:57.642 --> 31:59.258
It's a win-win proposition.

31:59.358 --> 32:01.493
What if I don't want your help?

32:01.593 --> 32:03.908
I could always turn you
into a water cooler.

32:05.624 --> 32:07.620
Got cuffs?

32:10.374 --> 32:11.711
Thanks.

32:11.811 --> 32:13.807
Here, hold this.

32:15.324 --> 32:18.257
So anyway, if you need help
on any cases,

32:18.357 --> 32:21.729
supernatural or otherwise,
I'm at your service.

32:21.829 --> 32:25.102
I'm gonna prove to everyone
that I'm not evil.

32:32.566 --> 32:33.983
Whether they like it or not.

32:34.083 --> 32:36.896
Look, she doesn't want you.

32:36.996 --> 32:39.012
Why don't you just give it up?

32:39.112 --> 32:41.108
Because I'm in love.

32:43.103 --> 32:45.299
Don't forget to tell her what I did.

32:49.050 --> 32:50.547
This is really good.

32:50.647 --> 32:53.181
Adding Eastern thinking
to Western Wicca.

32:53.281 --> 32:55.536
It should break through
the Sea Hag's protective charms.

32:55.636 --> 32:58.929
- Are you gonna answer your phone?
- No. It's my boss.

32:59.029 --> 33:01.523
- I've been gone all afternoon.
- Okay, then can we turn it off?

33:01.623 --> 33:04.277
Do you think it's possible to get
promoted and fired in the same day?

33:04.377 --> 33:06.473
Paige, please,
just turn off the phone.

33:06.573 --> 33:09.905
You know, maybe in our new destiny,
this job just isn't meant to be.

33:10.005 --> 33:12.001
Okay.

33:12.679 --> 33:15.194
Okay. Interesting.

33:15.792 --> 33:17.788
Phoebe.

33:19.025 --> 33:21.021
What is going on?

33:21.939 --> 33:23.835
He's back.

33:23.935 --> 33:25.511
- Who?
- Cole.

33:25.611 --> 33:27.607
What?

33:30.999 --> 33:32.256
This is his blood.

33:32.356 --> 33:34.352
Blood is not supposed to do that.

33:35.509 --> 33:37.745
- You stabbed him?
- Yeah.

33:38.503 --> 33:41.018
- Good.
- He wants me back.

33:41.536 --> 33:45.627
He wants me back,
and I just want to run.

33:45.727 --> 33:48.123
As fast and far as I can.

33:48.482 --> 33:49.899
I swear, if I had your power,

33:49.999 --> 33:53.191
Paige, I would orb myself to a rock
in the middle of the sea.

33:54.349 --> 33:57.402
He has put me through
so much, and I just...

33:57.502 --> 33:58.999
I don't wanna go through it again.

33:59.099 --> 34:01.314
Okay, running is not the answer.

34:01.414 --> 34:03.190
Don't give him that power over you.

34:03.290 --> 34:05.824
You have built
a great life for yourself.

34:05.924 --> 34:07.980
But it doesn't matter.

34:08.080 --> 34:10.074
I'm too tired to fight him.

34:11.391 --> 34:13.407
And I don't even know if I could.

34:13.507 --> 34:16.860
He's got all these
new demonic powers now.

34:17.938 --> 34:19.934
You know what,
turn your anger towards the Sea Hag.

34:20.692 --> 34:23.385
After we deal with her,
I'll test Cole's blood

34:23.485 --> 34:26.878
and come up with a magic way
to keep him from you, okay?

34:28.675 --> 34:30.670
Okay.

34:31.389 --> 34:33.385
Thank you.

34:33.743 --> 34:36.398
Let's see if the spell
that you wrote works.

34:36.498 --> 34:37.995
I will go find Piper.

34:38.094 --> 34:41.266
Oh, Piper.
I'm kind of worried about her.

34:41.367 --> 34:42.743
She picked maybe the worst time

34:42.842 --> 34:44.839
to come up with
a massive demon phobia.

34:45.478 --> 34:47.773
You think she's gonna be okay
to take on the Sea Hag?

34:47.873 --> 34:51.286
Well, I think pregnancy's
an emotional time,

34:51.386 --> 34:53.281
and anything can happen.

34:53.380 --> 34:55.377
I'll be fine.

34:55.856 --> 34:58.350
Okay, let's go. We got a job to do.

34:58.450 --> 35:00.984
- Are you sure you're up to it?
- Well, I don't have a choice.

35:01.084 --> 35:03.260
It's a power-of-three spell, right?
One, two, three.

35:03.360 --> 35:05.614
Should we wait for Leo
to find Craig before we go?

35:05.714 --> 35:08.070
No, Mylie needs us now.

35:10.664 --> 35:14.275
Okay, if this spell works,
it should take us right to the Sea Hag.

35:14.375 --> 35:16.511
<i>Powers of the witches rise</i>

35:16.611 --> 35:19.504
<i>Find the hag who speaks in lies</i>

35:19.604 --> 35:22.298
<i>Balance chakras, focus chi</i>

35:22.398 --> 35:25.312
<i>Lead us through the cruel, cruel sea</i>

35:53.530 --> 35:54.867
Hey!

35:54.967 --> 35:56.963
Sorry, I couldn't hold you.

35:58.120 --> 36:01.234
Phoebe, you can't stand,
you don't have legs.

36:01.633 --> 36:04.686
Okay, well, why me?
Why did I get the tail?

36:04.786 --> 36:06.961
We all read that spell together.

36:07.061 --> 36:08.638
Maybe because
you're the best swimmer?

36:08.738 --> 36:11.272
Yeah, at the Y.
But this is the ocean.

36:11.372 --> 36:14.345
It is very cold,
and I'm allergic to shellfish!

36:14.445 --> 36:17.898
Okay, forget that. Do you sense
the Sea Hag? Is she close?

36:17.998 --> 36:20.052
How should I know?

36:20.152 --> 36:22.288
Well, maybe if you put
your head underwater.

36:22.388 --> 36:23.965
And get my hair wet?

36:24.065 --> 36:25.321
Phoebe, you're a mermaid.

36:25.421 --> 36:27.238
You should be able
to sense the Sea Hag.

36:27.338 --> 36:31.129
My spell worked,
just not the way I envisioned it.

36:37.435 --> 36:39.710
I found Craig. He was on a plane
on his way to New York.

36:41.506 --> 36:43.043
Why am I standing in the ocean?

36:43.143 --> 36:45.279
Phoebe's a mermaid.

36:45.379 --> 36:48.132
Oh, well, that would explain it.

36:48.492 --> 36:51.006
Dive in. The water's great.

36:51.405 --> 36:53.840
Phoebe, get back here this instant.

36:57.711 --> 37:01.044
The call of the sea is intense.
Just like Mylie said it was.

37:01.144 --> 37:03.140
Well, ignore it.
Did you find the Sea Hag?

37:03.499 --> 37:05.914
Now that you mention it,
there was a stench under the water.

37:06.014 --> 37:07.830
That could be
the sewage treatment plant.

37:07.930 --> 37:09.745
We'll take our chances.
Follow the stench.

37:09.845 --> 37:11.222
- How?
- I don't know.

37:11.322 --> 37:13.218
Get in touch with your inner fish.

37:13.318 --> 37:16.850
And then when you find the cavern,
call for Leo and we will orb there.

37:16.950 --> 37:18.945
Okay.

37:22.298 --> 37:25.591
That's actually the most fun I've seen
Phoebe have since Cole died.

37:25.691 --> 37:28.505
- Which time?
- Good point.

37:28.605 --> 37:31.179
Okay, you guys ready?
T minus Sea Hag and counting.

37:31.279 --> 37:33.275
Piper, you got
the power-of-three spell?

37:38.223 --> 37:40.419
Piper, are you okay?

37:42.933 --> 37:46.406
I'm fine. Everything's under control.

37:54.867 --> 37:58.560
Are you ready
to make your pain go away?

37:58.660 --> 38:00.655
Yes.

38:03.449 --> 38:06.004
Necron will be pleased.

38:07.960 --> 38:11.691
It doesn't hurt. I promise.

38:11.791 --> 38:14.105
The auger shell brings peace.

38:46.236 --> 38:48.292
She's calling, let's go.

38:48.392 --> 38:50.547
Come on, come on, let's go!

39:13.178 --> 39:15.174
- Where's Piper?
- She let go of my hand.

39:15.652 --> 39:17.748
What?

39:17.848 --> 39:20.681
Enough with the water! Shell!

40:02.311 --> 40:04.846
- Is everyone okay?
- Yeah.

40:04.946 --> 40:07.001
No, she's dying.

40:07.101 --> 40:09.297
Can you heal her?

40:10.733 --> 40:12.628
It's no use. She's not human.

40:12.728 --> 40:14.724
No, not yet. Get Craig. Hurry.

40:16.241 --> 40:18.217
She should have stayed
in the water.

40:18.317 --> 40:21.231
- She could have avoided all of this.
- Can we stay positive, please?

40:21.589 --> 40:23.585
Get your hands off me. What...?

40:24.623 --> 40:27.198
What just happened? Where am I?

40:27.298 --> 40:30.291
Somewhere off the North Atlantic
would be my gut instinct.

40:31.608 --> 40:34.402
What...? Who are you people?

40:35.000 --> 40:36.616
- Witch.
- Angel.

40:36.716 --> 40:38.912
- Mermaid.
- Don't you mean witch?

40:41.346 --> 40:43.562
I know this is hard to accept.

40:43.662 --> 40:45.837
But all that matters is she's dying,
and you can help.

40:45.937 --> 40:47.233
What can I do?

40:47.333 --> 40:49.489
Tell her how you feel.

40:50.487 --> 40:51.864
Your love can save her.

40:51.964 --> 40:54.458
My love? Hey, how can I love her?

40:54.558 --> 40:57.113
- Look at her, she's got a...
- Really beautiful heart?

40:59.427 --> 41:02.121
Now you know what she is,
but who she is,

41:02.221 --> 41:04.217
you've always known that.

41:16.231 --> 41:18.227
I do love you.

42:11.391 --> 42:13.327
Thank you.

42:13.427 --> 42:15.362
Thank you for everything.

42:15.462 --> 42:18.277
Okay, I hate to cut this short,
but I can sense Piper's panic,

42:18.377 --> 42:21.330
and I think we should get back to her
and let her know everything's all right.

42:21.729 --> 42:23.265
Phoebe, take my hand,
I'll orb you back.

42:23.365 --> 42:25.661
Nope. I'm staying in the ocean.

42:25.761 --> 42:27.217
Okay, just meet us
back at the beach.

42:27.317 --> 42:29.452
You swim so fast, you'll probably
beat us there anyway.

42:29.552 --> 42:33.344
No, I'm staying in the ocean.
I'm not going back.

42:33.942 --> 42:35.239
I don't understand.

42:35.339 --> 42:37.335
Paige, it's everything
that Mylie said it was.

42:38.293 --> 42:39.869
It's complete freedom.

42:39.969 --> 42:43.123
The call of the sea.
It'll turn her heart cold if she lets it.

42:44.120 --> 42:47.014
- Phoebe, get out of the water.
- No.

42:47.114 --> 42:49.329
- Phoebe, take my hand.
- No!

42:49.429 --> 42:51.604
Phoebe, fight it!

42:51.704 --> 42:53.400
I don't want to fight it.

42:53.500 --> 42:55.496
I just want to be free.

42:58.649 --> 43:00.644
Phoebe!

43:52.453 --> 43:54.448
Leo, the Persian.

43:55.924 --> 43:57.661
I found Phoebe.

43:57.761 --> 44:00.256
You did?
Well, why didn't you bring her?

44:00.356 --> 44:02.790
She's too fast. And slippery.

44:03.388 --> 44:05.764
It's official, Phoebe's on the run.

44:05.864 --> 44:07.400
On the swim, technically.

44:07.500 --> 44:09.435
Well, what the heck
is she swimming from?

44:09.535 --> 44:12.988
She's got billboards, TV interviews,
she got her divorce,

44:13.088 --> 44:15.104
she should be loving life.

44:15.204 --> 44:17.937
- That's right, you don't know.
- I don't know what?

44:18.037 --> 44:19.454
Well, I didn't want
to make you mad,

44:19.554 --> 44:21.170
you know, you getting
so panicky and all...

44:21.270 --> 44:22.607
Yes, we've established

44:22.707 --> 44:24.802
I was a spineless coward
in the face of evil.

44:24.902 --> 44:26.898
Now, what don't I know?

44:28.215 --> 44:30.211
Cole's back.

44:30.609 --> 44:32.905
What? Why don't I know about this?

44:33.005 --> 44:36.337
- Well, Phoebe told me confidentially.
- Yes, but I'm your whitelighter.

44:36.437 --> 44:38.492
As a witch, you have a duty
to let me know this.

44:38.592 --> 44:40.568
I have a greater duty to my sister.

44:40.668 --> 44:42.883
Excuse me, but he's
the former Source of All Evil.

44:42.983 --> 44:46.056
This is not something
you just sweep under the rug.

44:50.047 --> 44:52.861
Breathe. Take a deep breath.
Take a deep breath.

44:52.961 --> 44:55.276
Does he want my baby?

44:55.836 --> 44:58.050
No, honey, of course not.

44:58.150 --> 45:00.226
He's in love. He wants Phoebe back.

45:01.423 --> 45:04.037
Hey, that's it. If Cole and Phoebe
declare their love...

45:04.137 --> 45:06.691
Cole's love is the problem,
not the solution.

45:07.051 --> 45:08.667
Paige, I know you hate Cole, but...

45:08.767 --> 45:11.900
Yeah, I do. I loathe and despise him,
but that's not the point.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.375
Mylie said that mermaids are
cold-hearted. Maybe that's why

45:14.475 --> 45:17.528
my spell turned Phoebe into
a mermaid in the first place.

45:17.628 --> 45:19.644
Wait a minute,
we're talking about Phoebe here.

45:19.744 --> 45:21.838
Since when did Phoebe
become cold-hearted?

45:21.938 --> 45:24.114
Well, maybe she's been in
the deep freeze

45:24.214 --> 45:26.389
ever since Cole came back.

45:26.489 --> 45:28.345
All right, so where do we go next?

45:28.445 --> 45:31.019
<i>I don't know, Book of Shadows,</i>
<i>Library of Congress, Internet.</i>

45:31.119 --> 45:33.753
Anywhere we can
to get rid of Phoebe's tail.

45:45.807 --> 45:47.803
Hag?

45:52.712 --> 45:55.346
I want my eternal life!

45:57.781 --> 46:00.574
Or your life, it's your choice.

46:33.623 --> 46:34.880
Who are you?

46:34.980 --> 46:37.295
You have something I want.

46:39.092 --> 46:41.087
They're all yours!

46:48.670 --> 46:51.763
I am so sorry I am missing work,
Mr. Cowan.

46:51.863 --> 46:56.913
l... It's just my sister,
she's had a fishing accident.

46:57.013 --> 47:01.543
Well, of course I'm grateful for
the promotion. Of course I am.

47:01.643 --> 47:03.977
And I'm gonna prove to you
just how grateful I am

47:04.077 --> 47:06.971
as soon as I get there, and...

47:07.071 --> 47:08.527
Mr. Cowan?

47:08.627 --> 47:10.623
Hello?

47:11.381 --> 47:13.377
I lost Phoebe.

47:13.895 --> 47:15.073
- You lost Phoebe?
- Yeah.

47:15.173 --> 47:16.470
Somewhere in the Gulf of Mexico.

47:16.570 --> 47:19.624
I was tracking her and...
She's getting harder to sense.

47:19.724 --> 47:22.358
I think the mermaid in her
is starting to take over.

47:22.677 --> 47:24.932
I'll just have to find a way
to turn her back.

47:25.032 --> 47:27.028
Look through these books.

47:27.786 --> 47:29.801
You've been working on this
all night?

47:29.901 --> 47:31.398
Yeah.

47:31.498 --> 47:32.915
Well, what have you learned so far?

47:33.015 --> 47:34.790
I have learned that mermaids
are cold-blooded,

47:34.890 --> 47:37.783
they like shiny baubles, sea chanteys
are the only songs they know,

47:37.883 --> 47:41.176
and my adoption file
is short one document.

47:41.276 --> 47:42.613
You lost me with that last one.

47:42.713 --> 47:44.449
Leo, it's my first day
as a social worker,

47:44.549 --> 47:47.163
and I'm already screwing up
and failing bigtime.

47:47.263 --> 47:49.259
This kid's adoption
is gonna fall apart without me.

47:49.659 --> 47:51.075
You can't let that happen.

47:51.175 --> 47:53.070
I'm so glad you agree.

47:53.170 --> 47:55.864
I was thinking I'd just cast a spell
from here and create a file...

47:55.964 --> 47:57.860
That's not what I meant.
Go to work.

47:57.960 --> 47:59.577
- But what about...?
- But what about what?

47:59.677 --> 48:01.653
You're just an orb away.

48:01.753 --> 48:04.586
- You sure you can handle this alone?
- I'm not alone. I have Piper.

48:05.544 --> 48:07.540
Piper.

48:08.178 --> 48:12.150
Okay, Leo, I don't know if it's because
she's afraid of the demons

48:12.250 --> 48:15.024
or she has guilt over Phoebe,
but she's not doing so well.

48:15.124 --> 48:17.318
I had to come down here
to get any work done at all.

48:17.877 --> 48:19.334
What do you mean?

48:19.434 --> 48:21.429
Go up to the attic
and see for yourself.

48:45.297 --> 48:48.510
Your scales...

48:48.610 --> 48:51.703
- No.
- Honey, it's okay.

48:51.803 --> 48:54.059
No, let go, I'm almost done.

48:54.159 --> 48:55.934
Piper, you need to take a break.

48:56.034 --> 48:58.908
I just need one more verse.

48:59.427 --> 49:01.901
Piper, this is not helping Phoebe.

49:06.252 --> 49:08.248
Leo...

49:08.727 --> 49:10.662
...I'm scared.

49:10.762 --> 49:14.494
- I know.
- No, you don't.

49:14.594 --> 49:16.809
I'm scared all of the time.

49:16.909 --> 49:18.365
Piper, you're pregnant.

49:18.465 --> 49:20.681
Your hormones and adrenaline
are running very high.

49:20.781 --> 49:22.038
It's okay to be afraid.

49:22.138 --> 49:24.313
No, it's not.

49:24.413 --> 49:26.409
Did you see what my fear
did to Phoebe?

49:26.728 --> 49:29.382
I'm supposed to be stronger than ever
now that I'm pregnant,

49:29.482 --> 49:31.178
for our daughter and my sisters.

49:31.278 --> 49:33.852
It's my job to take care of this family.

49:33.952 --> 49:36.506
Sometimes it's this family's job
to take care of you.

49:38.303 --> 49:40.618
You know, sometimes it's my job.

49:44.130 --> 49:45.347
Well, what do I do?

49:45.447 --> 49:47.423
You need to figure out
what's behind your fear.

49:47.523 --> 49:51.294
Okay, well, therapy takes years,
and Phoebe needs me now.

49:51.394 --> 49:55.146
Well, the only way you can help
Phoebe is by removing your fear.

49:57.063 --> 49:58.160
What did you say?

49:58.260 --> 50:01.573
I said you need to remove your fear,
and I can help you do that.

50:03.728 --> 50:04.985
I think you just did.

50:05.085 --> 50:10.174
Right now, I just need some...
Some time to figure this out.

50:10.274 --> 50:12.269
Alone.

50:50.307 --> 50:52.303
What's that?

50:57.411 --> 50:59.587
So how's your sister doing
after the fishing accident?

50:59.687 --> 51:02.420
Well, we're not sure,
we haven't found her yet.

51:02.520 --> 51:04.676
What, is she lost at sea?

51:05.035 --> 51:06.571
You could say that.

51:06.671 --> 51:09.684
- Paige!
- Look, Mr. Cowan,

51:09.784 --> 51:12.000
I may be stubborn at times,
and late to work often,

51:12.100 --> 51:14.474
and I don't always know
when to shut up, like right now,

51:14.574 --> 51:15.871
but trust me,

51:15.971 --> 51:18.067
even if I told you the truth,
you wouldn't believe me.

51:18.167 --> 51:20.601
So if you'll excuse me,
I have an adoption to save.

51:21.001 --> 51:23.475
You forgot insolent.
You're very insolent.

51:24.952 --> 51:27.047
You're right. Can I go now?

51:27.147 --> 51:29.222
Don't make me regret
giving you this promotion, Paige.

51:33.732 --> 51:35.728
Wait. Before you say anything...

51:36.846 --> 51:38.183
Not say. Do.

51:38.283 --> 51:41.915
Because I'm about to orb
your family jewels far, far away.

51:42.393 --> 51:43.770
Yeah, that would hurt.

51:43.870 --> 51:46.744
But you don't want to use your powers
in front of all these people, do you?

51:47.902 --> 51:51.095
- What do you want?
- I want to prove that I've changed.

51:51.494 --> 51:53.570
Not just to Phoebe,
but to you and Piper as well.

51:54.487 --> 51:57.381
The copies of the adoption application
and police clearances.

51:57.481 --> 51:59.217
Fax them ASAP.

51:59.317 --> 52:01.213
It might sway the agency's decision.

52:01.313 --> 52:04.985
I'm familiar with family law.
Maybe I could do some good here.

52:05.544 --> 52:06.960
Didn't we fire you?

52:07.060 --> 52:08.397
Actually, I quit.

52:08.497 --> 52:11.511
But now I'm a partner
at Jackman, Carter and Kline.

52:11.611 --> 52:15.342
- So, what are you doing here?
- Came to help Paige.

52:15.442 --> 52:18.077
Who doesn't want or need his help.

52:19.114 --> 52:21.748
A good social worker knows
when to use outside resources.

52:22.547 --> 52:26.179
They don't get much better
than Jackman, Carter and Kline.

52:29.412 --> 52:30.549
Well, you heard him.

52:30.649 --> 52:33.064
They don't get much better than me,
so let me help you.

52:33.164 --> 52:34.421
It won't be any trouble at all.

52:34.521 --> 52:36.896
No trouble?
You've been nothing but trouble.

52:36.996 --> 52:39.729
Phoebe was finally happy, and now
you're back, and suddenly she's a...

52:39.829 --> 52:41.825
Yellowtail?

52:42.184 --> 52:44.180
Your usual lunch order?

52:46.176 --> 52:48.970
No fish. Not now, not ever.

52:53.640 --> 52:55.636
Phoebe's a what?

52:58.230 --> 52:59.567
You wanna know what Phoebe is?

52:59.667 --> 53:01.721
She's a mermaid.
And do you want to know why?

53:01.821 --> 53:04.835
- I'm sorry, did you say "mermaid"?
- Yeah, gills, fins, scales and all.

53:04.935 --> 53:06.511
Well, you can fix that, right?

53:06.611 --> 53:09.026
No, Cole, we can't fix that,
because she wants to be a mermaid

53:09.126 --> 53:11.820
- because you broke her heart.
- I never meant to hurt her.

53:11.920 --> 53:14.095
You didn't mean to do lots of things,
but they happened.

53:14.195 --> 53:15.372
You are a one-man death squad.

53:15.472 --> 53:17.528
Bodies, blood and pain
follow you wherever you go.

53:17.628 --> 53:20.281
Well, there may be some truth to that,
but it's in my past.

53:20.381 --> 53:22.397
- I came back to make up...
- Make up for it?

53:22.497 --> 53:24.233
If you want to make up for it,
go to Tibet,

53:24.333 --> 53:27.146
join a monastery, pray for absolution,
but don't put your guilt on us.

53:27.246 --> 53:29.362
- You don't understand, I love...
- Love Phoebe?

53:29.801 --> 53:33.133
What is it with you guys? Like it's all
about you and your feelings.

53:33.233 --> 53:34.411
What about Phoebe's feelings?

53:34.511 --> 53:36.526
- She still loves me.
- Wrong, she doesn't love you.

53:36.626 --> 53:38.842
She thinks you're an evil freak
with super powers from hell

53:38.942 --> 53:40.119
and battery acid for blood.

53:40.219 --> 53:42.493
She doesn't love you.
She wishes you'd stayed dead.

53:43.810 --> 53:44.908
She told you this?

53:45.008 --> 53:47.263
Told me? She didn't have to tell me.
She's a mermaid.

53:47.363 --> 53:49.099
Her body erupted in scales.

53:49.199 --> 53:51.993
She had to turn into a fish to get away
from you. Do you get it now?

53:52.432 --> 53:55.126
Listen, the only way
you can help us get our sister back

53:55.226 --> 53:56.883
is for you to disappear.

53:56.983 --> 53:58.978
Forever.

54:06.202 --> 54:08.497
<i>Locked in, boxed in, full of fear</i>

54:08.597 --> 54:11.331
<i>My panic grows manic till I can't hear</i>

54:11.431 --> 54:13.565
<i>In need of reprieve</i>
<i>So that I can breathe</i>

54:13.665 --> 54:16.859
<i>Remove my fear</i>
<i>Please make it leave</i>

54:49.189 --> 54:51.184
What the hell?

55:03.238 --> 55:04.934
Watch it!

55:05.034 --> 55:07.010
No, get your filthy meat hooks
off me!

55:07.110 --> 55:08.926
Check out the mouth on her.

55:09.026 --> 55:11.021
All I care about is the tail.

55:12.738 --> 55:14.913
How much do you think the tabloids
would pay to see this?

55:15.013 --> 55:17.987
I don't know about you guys, but I don't
wanna spend my life on that boat.

55:18.087 --> 55:20.142
Maybe we should be thinking
bigger than tabloids here.

55:20.242 --> 55:21.339
- Bigger?
- Yeah.

55:21.439 --> 55:23.714
If we bring her in like this,
sure, we'll get a small fee.

55:24.352 --> 55:26.488
But mostly we'll just get credit
for finding her.

55:26.588 --> 55:28.863
Now, on the other hand,
if we say we found her dead,

55:29.262 --> 55:32.056
we could sell the body for a fortune.

55:35.089 --> 55:37.285
Sorry, her life belongs to me.

55:58.120 --> 56:01.133
Mermaids are such
poor, defenceless creatures.

56:01.233 --> 56:02.690
I almost feel pity.

56:02.790 --> 56:04.785
Pity this!

56:10.772 --> 56:14.524
Leo! I'm ready to go home now!

56:15.242 --> 56:17.238
I'm glad you finally
came to your senses.

56:19.354 --> 56:21.349
No!

56:26.818 --> 56:28.853
Go. Find the mermaid.

56:40.587 --> 56:44.080
Sorry. I was a medic, not a vet.

56:44.180 --> 56:46.295
Here's your water.

56:52.003 --> 56:53.999
Could use a little salt.

56:54.877 --> 56:57.331
- That's about all I can do for it.
- Okay, well, good enough.

56:57.431 --> 56:59.327
Will one of you orb me
back to the ocean, please?

56:59.427 --> 57:01.323
Wait, isn't there a demon after you?

57:01.423 --> 57:03.717
Demon?
Did somebody say demon?

57:03.817 --> 57:06.551
Yeah, one chased Phoebe
back home.

57:06.651 --> 57:09.065
Well, that was nice of it.
Welcome home.

57:09.165 --> 57:10.941
This isn't my home anymore.

57:11.041 --> 57:13.895
So, what about this demon?

57:13.995 --> 57:16.709
Where is it?
I'd like to thank it and then kill it.

57:17.947 --> 57:19.982
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yeah, never better.

57:20.421 --> 57:24.332
Ready to face my fears,
like that painting.

57:24.892 --> 57:27.665
I hung it on the wall because
I was afraid to tell Leo that it was ugly,

57:27.765 --> 57:29.761
but now...

57:33.513 --> 57:35.688
No offence, honey.

57:35.788 --> 57:37.723
So, what does this demon look like?

57:37.823 --> 57:40.258
Tall, dark and skeletal,
shoots electricity.

57:40.857 --> 57:43.352
<i>Paige, we need the Book of Shadows.</i>
<i>Can you orb it down here?</i>

57:43.452 --> 57:46.704
You want me to use magic
for household chores?

57:46.804 --> 57:48.660
I thought you had a total fear
of personal gain.

57:48.760 --> 57:51.454
See, there's that word again. "Fear."
It's very debilitating.

57:51.554 --> 57:53.550
Just do as I ask.

57:53.989 --> 57:56.144
<i>Book of Shadows.</i>

58:00.694 --> 58:03.188
Okay, I told you everything I know.

58:03.288 --> 58:05.184
- Can I go home now?
- You are home.

58:05.284 --> 58:08.457
And you're insane if you think
that I am gonna take you anywhere.

58:08.557 --> 58:10.951
Relax, Paige, everything will be fine.

58:11.630 --> 58:13.965
Glad you're so calm.

58:14.065 --> 58:16.958
Why are you so calm?

58:17.058 --> 58:20.551
Well, I just did as you suggested,
and now I feel fine.

58:20.651 --> 58:22.028
So can we save Phoebe?

58:22.128 --> 58:24.981
Okay, you guys, I don't need saving.

58:25.081 --> 58:29.571
Okay, all I need are my sea friends
and little shiny objects

58:29.671 --> 58:32.923
and to lay on a rock
and comb out my hair.

58:33.023 --> 58:34.919
I need water.

58:35.019 --> 58:37.075
Got him.

58:37.175 --> 58:38.632
- Yeah, that's him.
- "Necron.

58:38.732 --> 58:42.064
A skeletal being who hovers
between life and death.

58:42.164 --> 58:44.898
Has the power to incinerate any
living creature and feed on its life..."

58:44.998 --> 58:46.853
Yadda yadda yadda.

58:46.953 --> 58:50.087
No wonder he's after Phoebe.
If mermaids are immortal,

58:50.187 --> 58:51.683
and he's stuck between
life and death,

58:51.783 --> 58:54.217
then immortality would place him
squarely in the "life" column.

58:54.976 --> 58:58.110
Well, he cannot have
my immortality.

58:58.210 --> 59:01.461
Will someone please get me
back to the ocean before I suffocate?

59:01.561 --> 59:03.058
I need the water.

59:03.158 --> 59:06.271
You want water?
I'll get you some water.

59:07.230 --> 59:09.045
You are holding me hostage!

59:09.145 --> 59:10.283
Yep, looks like it.

59:10.383 --> 59:13.536
Look, I am not a common goldfish.
I cannot ignore the call of the sea.

59:14.055 --> 59:17.208
Well, the call of the common bathtub
is just gonna have to do.

59:20.361 --> 59:22.018
Why are you being so difficult?

59:22.118 --> 59:24.412
<i>The regulations</i>
<i>concerning this matter are clear.</i>

59:24.512 --> 59:27.006
<i>We cannot accept anything</i>
<i>but the original medical report</i>

59:27.106 --> 59:28.403
<i>for a legal adoption.</i>

59:28.503 --> 59:31.098
Well, that really just
doesn't work for me.

59:33.453 --> 59:37.385
Are you absolutely sure
you can't use the fax copy I sent you?

59:37.485 --> 59:39.100
<i>Of course we can, Mr. Turner.</i>

59:39.200 --> 59:41.096
<i>I'll finalize the adoption immediately.</i>

59:41.196 --> 59:43.630
<i>- Thank you.</i>
<i>- Anytime.</i>

59:47.343 --> 59:49.339
What was that?

59:50.057 --> 59:52.272
Just helping Paige
cut through some red tape.

59:52.372 --> 59:55.644
And she's okay with you using
voodoo powers to cheat the system?

59:56.243 --> 59:58.099
Well, she doesn't know
that I'm helping her.

59:58.199 --> 01:00:00.494
And they're not voodoo powers.

01:00:00.594 --> 01:00:03.687
Oh, what powers
are you packing these days?

01:00:03.787 --> 01:00:05.943
Maybe the power
to turn men into dust?

01:00:06.541 --> 01:00:07.918
What's that supposed to mean?

01:00:08.018 --> 01:00:10.512
Three fishermen
mysteriously vanished today

01:00:10.612 --> 01:00:13.087
and left behind what
the medical examiner believes to be

01:00:13.407 --> 01:00:14.863
piles of bone dust.

01:00:14.963 --> 01:00:17.737
- You think I killed them?
- Damn right I do.

01:00:17.837 --> 01:00:19.014
You think I killed them, me,

01:00:19.114 --> 01:00:22.127
the guy who saved your surprisingly
small brain from a bullet yesterday?

01:00:22.227 --> 01:00:26.139
You don't expect me to believe
that you did that for me?

01:00:26.818 --> 01:00:29.631
I'm just a pawn in your twisted scam
to win Phoebe back.

01:00:29.731 --> 01:00:31.906
I realize that people's reputations
precede them,

01:00:32.006 --> 01:00:35.418
but contrary to popular opinion, I am
not The Source of All Evil anymore.

01:00:35.518 --> 01:00:38.232
In fact, I'm not
the source of any evil anymore.

01:00:42.543 --> 01:00:44.858
I just want my wife back.

01:00:54.038 --> 01:00:56.413
Let's pretend for a second here,

01:00:56.513 --> 01:00:58.129
just for the sake of argument,

01:00:58.229 --> 01:01:02.420
that you saved my butt
because you are my friend.

01:01:02.859 --> 01:01:06.950
So as your hypothetical friend,
can I give you some advice?

01:01:07.050 --> 01:01:09.864
- Yeah.
- Don't do this to yourself.

01:01:09.964 --> 01:01:11.740
I can't help it.

01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:14.174
You love her. I get it.

01:01:14.274 --> 01:01:17.727
And your love, it's epic. Okay.

01:01:17.827 --> 01:01:19.822
Look what it's doing to you.

01:01:24.013 --> 01:01:26.108
Paige says she hates me.

01:01:26.208 --> 01:01:29.382
She says I should leave for good.

01:01:29.482 --> 01:01:32.475
You've known her for a long time,
Darryl. What do you think?

01:01:33.273 --> 01:01:35.269
Should I leave?

01:01:39.060 --> 01:01:41.216
I know you don't want to.

01:01:43.012 --> 01:01:46.644
But what you want
really doesn't matter, right?

01:01:49.917 --> 01:01:51.054
Right.

01:01:51.154 --> 01:01:53.470
Well, there you go.

01:02:15.621 --> 01:02:17.238
What is going on? Are you okay?

01:02:17.338 --> 01:02:19.374
Minor setback. It's fine.

01:02:23.564 --> 01:02:25.101
Minor setback?

01:02:25.201 --> 01:02:27.096
The room is on fire.

01:02:27.196 --> 01:02:30.808
You're supposed to be figuring out a
way to vanquish Necron, not yourself.

01:02:30.908 --> 01:02:33.283
Oh, come on, we weren't using
any of this junk anyway.

01:02:33.383 --> 01:02:34.839
Where's the fish girl?

01:02:34.939 --> 01:02:36.935
She's downstairs
cooling off in the tub.

01:02:37.255 --> 01:02:39.030
What are you
mixing up here anyway?

01:02:39.130 --> 01:02:43.062
Oh, a little burdock root
and some eye of newt.

01:02:43.162 --> 01:02:46.933
What? You're never, ever supposed
to mix those two things together.

01:02:47.033 --> 01:02:48.889
That is a volatile combination.

01:02:48.989 --> 01:02:52.441
Well, Necron's a serious threat,
we need a serious potion.

01:02:52.541 --> 01:02:53.799
<i>Did you know, in the Book,</i>

01:02:53.899 --> 01:02:56.033
there's a "witches be warned"
on skeletal beings?

01:02:56.133 --> 01:02:57.510
The last two that vanquished him...

01:02:57.610 --> 01:02:59.267
Actually, the only two
that vanquished him.

01:02:59.367 --> 01:03:00.464
- died in the process.

01:03:00.564 --> 01:03:02.858
Great. So the rate you're going,
you'll be number three.

01:03:02.958 --> 01:03:05.413
You know, you ought to be
more careful.

01:03:05.513 --> 01:03:07.848
Hey, "A good plan
violently executed this week

01:03:07.948 --> 01:03:11.041
is better than a perfect plan
executed next week."

01:03:11.141 --> 01:03:13.157
That's Patton.

01:03:13.257 --> 01:03:14.634
Why are you quoting Patton?

01:03:14.734 --> 01:03:17.727
So I figure
if I just double the burdock root...

01:03:18.245 --> 01:03:20.021
Hey!

01:03:20.121 --> 01:03:24.712
No touch. I don't want you
or my unborn niece around that.

01:03:27.785 --> 01:03:30.958
You shouldn't be inhaling all this
smoke when you're pregnant anyway.

01:03:31.058 --> 01:03:33.313
Paige, you're such a worrywart.

01:03:33.413 --> 01:03:35.109
What happened?

01:03:35.209 --> 01:03:37.065
We're just getting ready
to kick some demon ass.

01:03:37.165 --> 01:03:38.820
That's what we do, right?

01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:40.776
I'll get it. It's probably
Phoebe's interview.

01:03:40.876 --> 01:03:42.952
Well, send them away.

01:03:44.907 --> 01:03:47.462
Don't look at me, she's your wife.

01:03:47.862 --> 01:03:50.556
Does it seem like she overcame
her fear a little quickly to you?

01:03:50.656 --> 01:03:53.549
I don't know, I guess it's better than
her having a nervous breakdown

01:03:53.649 --> 01:03:55.384
like she was this morning.

01:03:55.484 --> 01:03:57.480
I'm not so sure.

01:04:00.434 --> 01:04:01.931
What are you looking at?

01:04:02.031 --> 01:04:03.727
To see if she had any help.

01:04:03.827 --> 01:04:07.340
Magical help?
Piper would never do that.

01:04:08.417 --> 01:04:10.193
Oh, no.

01:04:10.293 --> 01:04:12.608
It's a fearless spell.

01:04:13.287 --> 01:04:17.238
- Piper wrote a fearless spell.
- Paige!

01:04:18.275 --> 01:04:19.612
Gosh, I am so sorry.

01:04:19.712 --> 01:04:22.007
Your sister said we're doing
the interview in the bathroom.

01:04:22.107 --> 01:04:23.564
That should've been
your first clue

01:04:23.664 --> 01:04:26.238
that my sister sprang from
the shallower end of the gene pool.

01:04:26.338 --> 01:04:28.433
Oh, come on, Phoebe,
you wanted fame.

01:04:28.533 --> 01:04:30.309
<i>Go ahead and grab it.</i>
<i>Carpe diem.</i>

01:04:30.409 --> 01:04:32.145
Don't mention carp
around me, please.

01:04:32.245 --> 01:04:35.618
I am doing you a favour. People will
think you're bold and daring.

01:04:35.718 --> 01:04:38.532
What's better than a celebrity who
wants to do an interview in the nude?

01:04:38.632 --> 01:04:42.243
I could be just as fascinating with my
clothes on in a TV studio, thank you.

01:04:42.343 --> 01:04:43.640
Well, actually you can't.

01:04:43.740 --> 01:04:46.574
<i>My show is called</i>
<i>At Home With Nancy O'Dell.</i>

01:04:46.893 --> 01:04:48.989
See? Fabulous.

01:04:49.089 --> 01:04:51.084
Fire away.

01:04:52.202 --> 01:04:54.197
Piper.

01:04:55.794 --> 01:04:58.368
What is going on?
We heard Phoebe scre...

01:04:58.468 --> 01:05:00.444
She's going a TV interview.

01:05:00.544 --> 01:05:01.641
In the bathtub?

01:05:01.741 --> 01:05:03.637
Don't worry,
she's not showing any tail.

01:05:03.737 --> 01:05:06.311
That Nancy O'Dell
has, like, perfect teeth.

01:05:06.411 --> 01:05:09.624
You can't be serious.
You're risking exposure to all of us.

01:05:09.724 --> 01:05:13.257
Now, see, there's your risk-aversion
side rearing its ugly head again.

01:05:13.357 --> 01:05:15.252
Piper, we know you cast
a fearless spell.

01:05:15.352 --> 01:05:17.926
Not a fearless spell, a freedom spell.

01:05:18.026 --> 01:05:20.839
You told me to get rid of my fears,
so that's what I did.

01:05:20.939 --> 01:05:23.035
But you didn't get rid of it,
you just suppressed it.

01:05:23.135 --> 01:05:24.352
Well, what's the difference?

01:05:24.452 --> 01:05:27.785
I'm free to be myself
and to help others be themselves.

01:05:27.885 --> 01:05:29.661
Okay, but Phoebe's self
is a mermaid,

01:05:29.761 --> 01:05:34.011
and that self is about to be broadcast
on the 6:00 news unless we stop it.

01:05:34.111 --> 01:05:36.246
Now, see, you're only seeing
the downside here.

01:05:36.346 --> 01:05:37.403
What's the upside?

01:05:37.503 --> 01:05:40.557
The upside is Phoebe loves her job
more than anything else

01:05:40.657 --> 01:05:42.792
and doing this interview
will remind her of that

01:05:42.892 --> 01:05:45.087
and help bring her to her senses.

01:05:47.402 --> 01:05:50.336
People are chewing
entire species into extinction.

01:05:50.436 --> 01:05:53.250
Take Chilean sea bass.
I have yet to even spot one.

01:05:53.350 --> 01:05:57.580
And swordfish, for example, you might
as well be munching on a bald eagle.

01:05:58.658 --> 01:06:02.230
I didn't realize you had
such a passion for fish.

01:06:02.330 --> 01:06:04.305
Yeah, I do.

01:06:04.405 --> 01:06:07.418
Okay, we're gonna
have to end this now.

01:06:07.518 --> 01:06:09.614
It's okay. Ask one more question.

01:06:09.714 --> 01:06:11.131
So back to your advice to lovers.

01:06:11.231 --> 01:06:14.464
It's so real, so heartfelt,
especially lately.

01:06:14.783 --> 01:06:17.856
Is there a lucky guy in your life
that you get your inspiration from?

01:06:19.134 --> 01:06:21.229
- No, there's not.
- Really?

01:06:21.329 --> 01:06:23.325
Then what's with
all the love columns?

01:06:25.041 --> 01:06:27.036
I don't know.

01:06:27.356 --> 01:06:29.052
I think I do.

01:06:29.152 --> 01:06:32.245
Okay, I'm sorry, we're really gonna
have to wrap this up. Leo?

01:06:32.345 --> 01:06:33.842
Okay, come on,
I'll show you downstairs.

01:06:33.942 --> 01:06:36.795
- But we're not finished yet.
- I think you are.

01:06:36.895 --> 01:06:39.309
We'll reschedule. I'll have my people
call your people, okay?

01:06:39.409 --> 01:06:40.666
- Thanks.
- All right, bye-bye.

01:06:40.766 --> 01:06:42.762
- Bye, Nance.
- Bye-bye.

01:06:45.117 --> 01:06:46.334
So how you feel?

01:06:46.434 --> 01:06:48.430
Actually, thanks to you, I feel free.

01:06:48.909 --> 01:06:51.124
Free from the shallowness
of human pursuit.

01:06:51.224 --> 01:06:55.176
From craving wealth and fame. Now all
I crave is the serenity of the sea.

01:06:56.533 --> 01:06:58.468
Good job on the fearless spell.

01:06:58.568 --> 01:07:00.564
What fearless spell?

01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:04.595
What the heck is their problem?

01:07:05.793 --> 01:07:07.788
- Orb Phoebe to the attic.
- What about you?

01:07:10.662 --> 01:07:12.658
Just do it!

01:07:18.085 --> 01:07:20.441
Okay, static man, very impressive.

01:07:31.936 --> 01:07:33.752
How long is that spell gonna take?

01:07:33.852 --> 01:07:36.166
I don't know, it's tricky.
There's a lot of factors involved.

01:07:37.483 --> 01:07:39.459
Okay, why can't we just
orb to Necron

01:07:39.559 --> 01:07:41.795
and try the vanquishing potion
that Piper was working on?

01:07:42.273 --> 01:07:44.807
Because Piper was under the
influence when she mixed that potion,

01:07:44.907 --> 01:07:48.340
as you can tell by the lovely remains
of our burned-out attic.

01:07:49.139 --> 01:07:52.052
Okay, so, what happened?

01:07:52.651 --> 01:07:54.067
Well, thanks to her fearless spell,

01:07:54.167 --> 01:07:57.380
she went straight to an offensive place
with her explosion potion,

01:07:57.480 --> 01:07:59.416
and I don't think that's the answer.

01:07:59.516 --> 01:08:01.053
Why not? It sounds good
to me right now.

01:08:01.153 --> 01:08:03.727
Well, because the last two witches
that vanquished skeletal beings

01:08:03.827 --> 01:08:05.363
were vaporized in the process.

01:08:05.463 --> 01:08:08.037
I think a power-of-three spell
is our best chance of killing Necron

01:08:08.137 --> 01:08:10.133
and staying alive.

01:08:11.171 --> 01:08:12.707
- Can you sense her?
- Yeah.

01:08:12.807 --> 01:08:14.064
- Is she hurt?
- Who knows?

01:08:14.164 --> 01:08:17.417
All I can sense is courage,
lots and lots of courage.

01:08:17.517 --> 01:08:19.452
Well, don't worry, honey,
he's not gonna kill her.

01:08:19.551 --> 01:08:21.548
He needs her alive
if he's gonna get to me.

01:08:22.107 --> 01:08:25.599
Yeah, well, we still have to hurry
before Piper does something stupid.

01:08:25.698 --> 01:08:28.551
Like get Nancy O'Dell
an exclusive with Necron.

01:08:28.652 --> 01:08:32.185
I'm beginning to wonder if this whole
power-of-three spell is even worth it.

01:08:32.285 --> 01:08:33.782
- What do you mean?
- Well, firstly,

01:08:33.881 --> 01:08:35.417
it's not really
a power-of-three spell.

01:08:35.518 --> 01:08:39.629
More like a power-of-two-and-a-half
spell, considering you're half a witch.

01:08:40.068 --> 01:08:42.761
Secondly, I'm worried
that my fearless wife

01:08:42.862 --> 01:08:44.877
won't let us interfere
to take on Necron.

01:08:44.977 --> 01:08:47.252
She isn't exactly using
her best judgment right now.

01:08:47.810 --> 01:08:49.827
I don't even know why she cast
that spell, you know.

01:08:49.926 --> 01:08:51.863
I could have helped her through it.

01:08:51.962 --> 01:08:53.578
Well, try to see
where she's coming from.

01:08:53.679 --> 01:08:55.055
She's barely been able to function,

01:08:55.156 --> 01:08:58.587
and she blames herself
for what happened to Phoebe.

01:08:59.147 --> 01:09:01.421
Wait a minute, what do you mean,
"What happened to Phoebe?"

01:09:02.020 --> 01:09:04.435
What happened to me is the best thing
that ever happened to me.

01:09:04.535 --> 01:09:08.527
I am swimming with the dolphins now.
I'm basking with belugas.

01:09:09.484 --> 01:09:12.598
Leo, I actually think I've got something,
but I need to talk to you about it alone.

01:09:13.117 --> 01:09:16.090
Okay, you see? This is exactly why
I love being a mermaid.

01:09:16.189 --> 01:09:17.965
There are no secrets underwater.

01:09:18.064 --> 01:09:20.799
You know, there are no walls
to keep you trapped.

01:09:20.899 --> 01:09:23.573
Okay, enough. Leo, stairs.

01:09:25.211 --> 01:09:28.462
You guys, wait. Wait, you guys.

01:09:28.563 --> 01:09:29.779
If we orb Phoebe to the ocean,

01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:32.375
the second Necron is a pile of dust,
she's out of here for good.

01:09:32.475 --> 01:09:33.930
Do we have another option?

01:09:34.031 --> 01:09:37.085
I don't know. Something Nancy O'Dell
said in that interview got me thinking.

01:09:37.185 --> 01:09:39.399
What if Phoebe's heart
isn't as cold as we thought?

01:09:39.499 --> 01:09:41.515
Well, we don't have time to find out.

01:09:41.615 --> 01:09:43.590
Well, let's take the time, okay?

01:09:43.689 --> 01:09:46.264
I don't want to save one sister
just to lose another.

01:09:46.363 --> 01:09:49.877
I'm sorry, Paige, but that is a risk
that we have to take.

01:09:56.103 --> 01:09:59.196
All right, what did you guys
say about me?

01:09:59.296 --> 01:10:01.910
I said I thought you were gonna swim
away the moment we save Piper.

01:10:02.010 --> 01:10:04.724
- Are you?
- Come on, we have to hurry.

01:10:11.510 --> 01:10:13.825
This better work.

01:10:18.575 --> 01:10:20.571
Where's Paige?

01:10:24.202 --> 01:10:28.832
I think we've given your sisters
enough time to worry about you.

01:10:30.309 --> 01:10:32.943
Now, call for your whitelighter.

01:10:34.021 --> 01:10:36.016
Or what?

01:10:41.685 --> 01:10:43.780
Oh, please, please,
somebody help me.

01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:47.472
The mean demon is dipping me
into the water and it's really cold.

01:10:48.270 --> 01:10:50.266
Attack!

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:03.996
Is that the best you got?

01:11:04.355 --> 01:11:06.351
Again.

01:11:11.620 --> 01:11:12.957
Cole?

01:11:13.057 --> 01:11:14.952
Paige, you don't have
to break into my apartment.

01:11:15.052 --> 01:11:16.908
I'm leaving. I'm taking your advice.

01:11:17.008 --> 01:11:19.282
Don't. I've been known
to give very bad advice.

01:11:19.602 --> 01:11:22.197
- I beg your pardon?
- Phoebe needs your help.

01:11:23.594 --> 01:11:27.805
I know. That's why I'm going away.
It's the best way to help her.

01:11:27.905 --> 01:11:29.900
- Now, if you'll excuse me...
- No!

01:11:30.259 --> 01:11:33.852
- What are you doing?
- Please, I can't let you leave.

01:11:34.969 --> 01:11:36.426
What kind of game are you playing?

01:11:36.526 --> 01:11:40.277
I'm not playing any games.
I told you, Phoebe needs your help.

01:11:40.956 --> 01:11:43.750
And you need psychological help.

01:11:44.229 --> 01:11:45.486
Okay, that's probably true,

01:11:45.586 --> 01:11:47.840
especially because I cannot believe
what I'm about to say,

01:11:47.940 --> 01:11:51.233
but I think Phoebe's
still in love with you.

01:11:51.333 --> 01:11:54.467
Oh, yeah, "Phoebe hates you so much
her body erupted in scales."

01:11:54.567 --> 01:11:56.423
That's what you said this morning.

01:11:56.523 --> 01:11:59.416
Okay, maybe
an unfortunate choice of words.

01:11:59.516 --> 01:12:01.850
I thought Phoebe was running away
because she hated you,

01:12:01.950 --> 01:12:04.944
but now I think
it's because she loves you.

01:12:06.660 --> 01:12:09.894
- You think?
- It's a theory.

01:12:10.691 --> 01:12:14.404
Look, her advice column has been
obsessed with love ever since you left.

01:12:15.601 --> 01:12:17.177
You told me to go away.

01:12:17.277 --> 01:12:21.208
Phoebe said it, Darryl said it.
I got the message.

01:12:21.308 --> 01:12:24.222
Now you're changing
your opinion based on a theory?

01:12:25.459 --> 01:12:27.655
What if I can prove it?

01:12:29.092 --> 01:12:31.088
Only Phoebe can prove
that she still loves me.

01:12:32.045 --> 01:12:34.140
You're right.

01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:36.176
<i>Open Phoebe's heart to Cole</i>

01:12:36.276 --> 01:12:37.932
<i>Reveal the secret that it holds</i>

01:12:38.032 --> 01:12:40.087
<i>Bring forth the passion of love's fire</i>

01:12:40.187 --> 01:12:42.742
<i>That he may feel her true desire</i>

01:12:45.017 --> 01:12:47.013
What did you do?

01:12:54.956 --> 01:12:56.951
Phoebe.

01:13:02.858 --> 01:13:06.091
I guess she loves you more
than either of us realized.

01:13:13.395 --> 01:13:15.471
Paige wasn't in the manor.
I don't know where she is.

01:13:15.910 --> 01:13:18.564
Okay, well, forget her.
Let's go find Piper.

01:13:18.664 --> 01:13:21.658
Yeah, but you need
the power of three to take out Necron.

01:13:23.534 --> 01:13:25.269
He's hurting her again.

01:13:25.369 --> 01:13:27.505
- He wants me, I'm going alone.
- No!

01:13:27.605 --> 01:13:30.419
Leo, I can't let anything happen
to Piper or the baby.

01:13:30.519 --> 01:13:32.973
- Yeah, but Phoebe...
- You wait here for Paige.

01:13:33.073 --> 01:13:35.089
I'm gonna go buy us some time.

01:13:35.189 --> 01:13:37.184
Phoebe!

01:13:47.602 --> 01:13:51.253
Okay, I've had enough.

01:13:51.353 --> 01:13:53.389
Your treatment of me is shocking.

01:13:54.546 --> 01:13:56.601
Get it? "Shocking"?

01:13:56.701 --> 01:14:00.593
- Do you have a death wish?
- You're not demon enough to kill me.

01:14:00.693 --> 01:14:02.509
You would've done it already
if you were.

01:14:02.609 --> 01:14:06.840
On the contrary.
I wasn't hungry until now.

01:14:07.238 --> 01:14:11.031
But it's just about my feeding time.

01:14:13.225 --> 01:14:15.421
Let her go! It's me that you want.

01:14:18.215 --> 01:14:20.589
Oh, look out, Phoebe,
he's packing a seashell.

01:14:20.689 --> 01:14:23.623
- You know what this is?
- Yeah, auger shell.

01:14:23.723 --> 01:14:25.659
Sucks eternal life.

01:14:25.759 --> 01:14:29.511
Look, I will give you my immortality
if you let my sister go.

01:14:33.941 --> 01:14:34.999
No!

01:14:35.099 --> 01:14:38.650
And I promise I'll kill her
unless you give me what I want first.

01:14:39.170 --> 01:14:41.166
Piper, are you okay?

01:14:42.083 --> 01:14:44.079
My baby.

01:14:45.356 --> 01:14:47.352
What did you do?

01:14:54.257 --> 01:14:56.293
Keep your promise, witch.

01:15:07.188 --> 01:15:08.805
Where you been?

01:15:08.905 --> 01:15:11.580
I forgot the vanquishing spell
in the attic.

01:15:18.085 --> 01:15:20.081
Honey, it's okay. I'm right here.

01:15:23.474 --> 01:15:25.469
Phoebe!

01:15:26.986 --> 01:15:28.982
Shell!

01:15:30.219 --> 01:15:32.953
Piper, take Phoebe's hand.

01:15:33.053 --> 01:15:35.148
Okay, prepare for a big blast.

01:15:35.248 --> 01:15:37.183
<i>Tide of evil, washed ashore</i>

01:15:37.283 --> 01:15:39.139
<i>Bring its darkness evermore</i>

01:15:39.239 --> 01:15:41.055
<i>With all our strength, we fight this fate</i>

01:15:41.155 --> 01:15:43.150
<i>Make this evil obliterate</i>

01:16:37.193 --> 01:16:38.490
Paige, wake up.

01:16:38.590 --> 01:16:40.706
Paige! Wake up!

01:16:44.657 --> 01:16:46.993
No wonder those demons
carry warning labels.

01:16:47.093 --> 01:16:48.909
Tell me about it.

01:16:49.009 --> 01:16:52.520
- Leo, you okay?
- Yeah, I think so.

01:16:56.791 --> 01:16:58.787
Where's Piper?

01:17:05.133 --> 01:17:07.128
Piper.

01:17:09.524 --> 01:17:11.818
I know why you've been afraid.

01:17:11.918 --> 01:17:15.910
You don't want to leave your baby
the way I left you.

01:17:17.905 --> 01:17:21.777
But spells won't make
that fear go away, only faith will.

01:17:22.655 --> 01:17:26.926
Have faith that your destiny
is different than mine.

01:17:30.718 --> 01:17:32.713
Take my hand, sweetie.

01:17:59.536 --> 01:18:02.130
- Mom?
- No, it's okay, honey, it's us.

01:18:02.489 --> 01:18:04.484
Leo, heal her stomach.

01:18:08.635 --> 01:18:10.931
How'd you do that?

01:18:11.031 --> 01:18:13.027
I didn't.

01:18:14.224 --> 01:18:16.219
- The baby did.
- What?

01:18:17.775 --> 01:18:20.051
I guess she takes
after her daddy.

01:18:23.045 --> 01:18:25.139
That must have been
what Mom meant.

01:18:25.239 --> 01:18:28.133
- Mom?
- She came to me in the water.

01:18:28.233 --> 01:18:31.028
She helped me understand
why I've been so afraid.

01:18:32.185 --> 01:18:35.278
I don't wanna leave my baby
without a mother.

01:18:35.378 --> 01:18:37.313
You have something that she didn't.

01:18:37.413 --> 01:18:39.729
- Oh, yeah? What's that?
- Me.

01:18:41.445 --> 01:18:43.440
And me.

01:18:46.593 --> 01:18:48.589
But not her.

01:18:50.026 --> 01:18:52.400
- What do we do?
- Nothing.

01:18:52.500 --> 01:18:54.676
I have a feeling
she'll come back again.

01:18:54.776 --> 01:18:56.352
How do you figure?

01:18:56.452 --> 01:18:59.764
Let's just say I have a pretty good idea
about what's going on inside her head.

01:19:10.701 --> 01:19:12.837
How did I get here?

01:19:12.937 --> 01:19:14.752
I brought you here.

01:19:14.852 --> 01:19:17.785
This isn't happening.
This can't be happening.

01:19:17.885 --> 01:19:19.701
This goes beyond stalking!

01:19:19.801 --> 01:19:22.076
I'm not stalking you. Paige sent me.

01:19:24.711 --> 01:19:26.566
I know why you ran, Phoebe.

01:19:26.666 --> 01:19:28.682
You don't know anything about me.

01:19:28.782 --> 01:19:31.955
You thought you could escape
into this big ocean,

01:19:32.055 --> 01:19:34.050
that the waves
would wash away your pain.

01:19:34.529 --> 01:19:37.762
But they won't. Not until you admit
what drove you here in the first place.

01:19:38.282 --> 01:19:41.175
I know what drove me here. You.

01:19:41.275 --> 01:19:42.532
Yeah, but why?

01:19:42.632 --> 01:19:45.146
And don't say because you're
scared of me, because you're not.

01:19:46.743 --> 01:19:50.096
Come on, you don't want to spend
eternity alone just to avoid the truth.

01:19:50.934 --> 01:19:53.987
If not for me,
be honest for your own sake.

01:19:54.087 --> 01:19:56.083
Don't lose yourself because of me.

01:19:57.041 --> 01:19:58.737
What do you want me to say?

01:19:58.837 --> 01:20:00.893
You don't have to say anything.

01:20:00.993 --> 01:20:04.424
All you have to do to free yourself
is admit how you truly feel about me.

01:20:05.183 --> 01:20:07.178
In your heart.

01:20:33.122 --> 01:20:35.438
How could you be so sure?

01:20:36.755 --> 01:20:38.750
I had a feeling.

01:20:42.622 --> 01:20:44.517
I do love you.

01:20:44.617 --> 01:20:46.613
And I always will.

01:20:47.412 --> 01:20:49.966
But it doesn't change anything.

01:20:50.484 --> 01:20:52.480
It doesn't matter.

01:20:54.396 --> 01:20:56.392
It's over between us.

01:21:40.017 --> 01:21:42.013
Paige.

01:21:45.606 --> 01:21:49.217
I know I've been tough on you,
but I don't want you to quit.

01:21:49.317 --> 01:21:51.313
You've got a real gift
for helping people.

01:21:52.231 --> 01:21:53.647
Don't worry.

01:21:53.747 --> 01:21:56.083
I'm gonna keep helping people.

01:21:56.183 --> 01:21:59.376
I just don't wanna
split my focus anymore.

01:22:01.171 --> 01:22:03.447
But thanks for everything.
