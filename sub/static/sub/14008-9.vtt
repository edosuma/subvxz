Previously on Damages:

00:02.315 --> 00:03.916
Congratulations are in order.

00:03.917 --> 00:05.086
You're gonna be a grandmother.

00:05.087 --> 00:06.368
Remind me what you do?

00:06.369 --> 00:07.818
I'm sort of an architect.

00:07.819 --> 00:10.326
It's always felt like
I'm living in a hotel.

00:10.327 --> 00:12.661
The warmth all lie behind these walls.

00:12.662 --> 00:16.509
There's somebody here tonight that I think
merits special attention: Terry Brooke.

00:16.510 --> 00:18.392
Now we all know Terry from Hollywood.

00:18.393 --> 00:20.204
It's your life story, huh?

00:20.205 --> 00:22.111
Let me option this,
and I want to play you.

00:22.112 --> 00:23.598
I'm not doing drugs, Ellen.

00:23.599 --> 00:25.602
I need you to be honest with me.

00:25.603 --> 00:27.804
Here are account statements
from my bank in Antigua.

00:27.805 --> 00:30.104
I don't see how this could have
anything to do with the Tobin's money.

00:30.105 --> 00:31.489
Where did you spend last Thanksgiving?

00:31.490 --> 00:32.873
Upstate with a friend and her family.

00:32.874 --> 00:33.550
Why?

00:33.551 --> 00:35.030
You didn't celebrate with your mother?

00:35.031 --> 00:35.710
No.

00:35.711 --> 00:37.090
We may have another lead.

00:37.091 --> 00:38.481
Carol Tobin's missing.

00:38.482 --> 00:40.505
She hasn't been back to
her apartment in days.

00:40.506 --> 00:41.483
Are you okay?

00:41.484 --> 00:44.578
Carol, let me speak
with Lenny alone, okay?

00:44.579 --> 00:46.219
Why are you hiding her?

00:46.220 --> 00:50.260
Because Zedeck didn't kill Danielle.

What's this?

01:11.875 --> 01:15.263
My resignation from the firm.

02:12.601 --> 02:14.603
Carol?!

02:22.280 --> 02:24.748
You all right?

02:27.385 --> 02:29.954
Brought you lunch.

02:30.021 --> 02:33.124
You didn't eat yesterday.

02:33.191 --> 02:36.460
You didn't eat anything
this morning either.

02:47.641 --> 02:49.008
What can I do?

02:49.009 --> 02:51.240
Nothing.

02:51.308 --> 02:53.542
Are you sure?

02:53.609 --> 02:55.441
You'll be out of here soon.

02:55.442 --> 02:58.375
It's just not safe for you to leave yet.

02:58.376 --> 02:59.909
Why not?

02:59.910 --> 03:05.376
Someone from the DA's
office approached Joe.

03:05.444 --> 03:09.245
They're conducting an
investigation into Danielle's death.

03:09.246 --> 03:12.014
So, how long do I have to be here?

03:12.015 --> 03:13.982
Until they close the file.

03:13.983 --> 03:15.716
And when they do, then we'll get

03:15.717 --> 03:17.351
you right back to your apartment

03:17.352 --> 03:21.254
and everything will be... just as normal.

03:28.861 --> 03:33.697
Would you like to start
seeing Dr. Samuels again?

03:33.765 --> 03:37.300
You know my brother
doesn't want me to do that.

03:37.301 --> 03:42.473
But do you think seeing your
psychiatrist would be helpful to you?

03:47.813 --> 03:50.515
Well, it's not healthy
for you living like this.

03:50.516 --> 03:52.417
I'm gonna talk to Joe.

03:52.485 --> 03:53.585
Fine.

03:53.586 --> 03:55.253
Do whatever you want.

03:55.254 --> 03:57.154
He won't change his mind, and

03:57.189 --> 03:59.023
I'm gonna be stuck here forever.

04:04.928 --> 04:07.529
He'll never get it.

04:10.600 --> 04:12.433
Has anyone tried to approach her?

04:12.434 --> 04:13.101
No, sir.

04:13.102 --> 04:13.968
No one's been by.

04:13.969 --> 04:14.635
Building's been quiet.

04:14.636 --> 04:15.301
Okay.

04:15.302 --> 04:17.503
You have my number if anything comes up.

04:17.504 --> 04:19.505
Yes, sir.

04:30.748 --> 04:33.216
Malcolm told us that Carol
Tobin hasn't left the loft

04:33.217 --> 04:36.518
in four days and the Tobins have
security outside the building.

04:36.586 --> 04:39.688
They're afraid she's gonna be
questioned about Danielle's murder.

04:39.689 --> 04:45.226
- Did you find anything at the DA's office?
- After the Ponzi scheme went public, we

04:45.227 --> 04:47.862
interviewed Carol Tobin, so
I looked up the transcript,

04:47.863 --> 04:50.097
What did she say about Thanksgiving?

04:50.098 --> 04:56.558
After her father confessed, Carol said that
she went... back to her apartment alone,

04:56.559 --> 05:01.641
but no one talked to her until the next day
when the authorities came to question her.

05:01.709 --> 05:04.243
But I still don't understand
what you're thinking about

05:04.244 --> 05:08.247
- Thanksgiving. Why would that lead you to the money?
- Well, we think we

05:08.248 --> 05:09.715
know where the Tobins are hiding it.

05:09.716 --> 05:10.382
Where?

05:10.383 --> 05:11.050
Antigua.

05:11.051 --> 05:13.419
And Thanksgiving was
Louis Tobin's last chance

05:13.420 --> 05:16.054
to move the money before he confessed.

05:16.055 --> 05:19.591
Yeah. Hopefully, we can get Carol to
tell us something about that night.

05:19.592 --> 05:24.495
We just have to get to her without
tipping off the rest of the family.

05:26.398 --> 05:29.299
The planet Earth... our future.

05:29.300 --> 05:32.969
And the wind... our greatest resource.

05:32.970 --> 05:38.106
Renewable energy is no longer a
far-off, pie-in-the-sky ambition.

05:38.107 --> 05:41.305
It's here today as an achievable goal.

05:41.306 --> 05:42.772
And the Whirlwind Initiative

05:42.773 --> 05:44.305
wants to make sure that that

05:44.306 --> 05:45.738
goal becomes a reality.

05:45.739 --> 05:47.837
I'm Terry Brooke.

05:47.905 --> 05:51.537
You may have seen me in the
silver screen saving the world

05:51.538 --> 05:55.139
in the movies, but today I'd
like to ask you to join me in

05:55.140 --> 05:58.710
supporting the Whirlwind
Initiative, so together we can

05:58.778 --> 06:03.215
save the world for real.

06:03.282 --> 06:05.883
Cut! Cut.

06:05.951 --> 06:06.851
How was that?

06:06.852 --> 06:07.718
Oh, fantastic!

06:07.719 --> 06:09.052
Are you kidding me?

06:09.053 --> 06:12.521
Hey, you have the power
of persuasion, my friend.

06:12.522 --> 06:14.556
The dialogue feels a little clunky.

06:14.557 --> 06:17.358
Mind if I play with that a little bit?

06:17.359 --> 06:18.092
Whatever you want.

06:18.093 --> 06:19.126
A couple of tweaks.

06:19.127 --> 06:20.827
Yeah, yeah, just go with the flow.

06:20.828 --> 06:22.228
Let me take another crack at it.

06:22.229 --> 06:23.562
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

06:23.563 --> 06:25.664
We can get it in little bits and pieces.

06:25.665 --> 06:26.497
Good, good, good.

06:26.498 --> 06:27.631
I'm ready. All right.

06:27.632 --> 06:28.298
Planet Earth.

06:28.299 --> 06:30.900
Earth. Maybe just "Earth."

06:30.968 --> 06:31.767
Planet.

06:31.768 --> 06:34.636
Planet Earth.

06:34.637 --> 06:36.638
The planet Earth.

06:39.340 --> 06:40.640
Ellen.

06:40.641 --> 06:41.774
Hey.

06:41.775 --> 06:44.442
You need to see this arrest report.

06:44.443 --> 06:46.577
Who got busted?

06:49.215 --> 06:52.785
I didn't tell Gates.

06:56.024 --> 06:58.027
Thanks, Nick.

07:14.046 --> 07:15.046
Thank you.

07:15.047 --> 07:18.749
You got ten minutes, ma'am.

07:24.088 --> 07:27.023
- Are you okay?
- This whole thing is bullshit.

07:27.024 --> 07:29.325
They said you had over an ounce on you.

07:29.326 --> 07:30.092
Is that true?

07:30.093 --> 07:31.626
Yeah, but I wasn't dealing.

07:31.627 --> 07:32.527
It doesn't matter.

07:32.528 --> 07:35.063
By law, anything over an ounces
is considered intent to distribute.

07:35.064 --> 07:36.164
It's a Class B felony.

07:36.165 --> 07:38.332
Well, I wasn't gonna sell it, you know?

07:38.333 --> 07:40.434
I was just gonna give it to a friend.

07:40.435 --> 07:41.401
Stop lying!

07:41.402 --> 07:42.335
I'm not lying!

07:42.336 --> 07:44.971
I can only help you if
you're honest with me.

07:44.972 --> 07:46.872
I'm...

07:46.940 --> 07:50.208
you know, I'm broke, Ellen.

07:50.276 --> 07:51.343
And Eddie left me.

07:51.344 --> 07:53.144
What else was I supposed to do?

07:53.145 --> 07:54.745
You should have come to me.

07:54.746 --> 07:55.846
I offered to help you.

07:55.847 --> 07:58.615
Yeah, you gave me a check
and en you canceled it.

07:58.616 --> 07:59.749
Thanks. Lot of help.

07:59.750 --> 08:02.985
I only canceled it because you
were lying to me about the drugs.

08:02.986 --> 08:08.390
What's gonna happen now? Hmm?

08:08.457 --> 08:10.458
Am I going to jail?

08:12.828 --> 08:14.161
Probably, yes.

08:14.162 --> 08:16.864
Will you be my lawyer?

08:16.865 --> 08:17.865
I can't.

08:17.866 --> 08:19.132
I work for the DA.

08:19.133 --> 08:22.168
We prosecute drug offenders,
we don't defend them.

08:22.169 --> 08:25.938
So you won't help me?

08:26.005 --> 08:29.273
I would plead guilty.

08:29.308 --> 08:30.942
You're a first-time drug offender.

08:30.943 --> 08:33.277
If you're lucky, maybe they'll be lenient.

08:33.278 --> 08:34.111
I see.

08:34.111 --> 08:35.111
I'm not your problem, you know,

08:35.113 --> 08:37.047
so why get your hands dirty?

08:37.115 --> 08:40.383
As always, you're just
gonna do what's best for you.

08:42.352 --> 08:45.487
And what's gonna happen to my baby, huh?

08:45.487 --> 08:47.922
Don't you even care about Charlotte?

08:47.923 --> 08:49.756
Of course I do.

08:49.757 --> 08:53.292
I'll talk to someone in Social Services.

08:53.293 --> 08:55.427
You will?

08:55.494 --> 08:57.095
Yeah, I will.

08:57.096 --> 09:01.064
In the meantime, figure
out what you want to do.

09:01.132 --> 09:04.800
Let me know if you're
ready to make a change.

09:07.836 --> 09:09.736
Hello?!

09:13.073 --> 09:15.307
Carol?

09:22.679 --> 09:24.679
Carol?

09:28.650 --> 09:31.317
Is everything okay?

09:34.487 --> 09:36.488
Carol?

09:37.757 --> 09:39.359
Jesus Christ!

09:39.360 --> 09:40.995
Just a few drops.

09:40.996 --> 09:42.633
What?

09:42.634 --> 09:44.503
Just a few drops.

09:44.504 --> 09:46.039
No, no!

09:46.040 --> 09:47.443
There's no blood.

09:47.444 --> 09:48.812
No, no, no blood.

09:48.813 --> 09:51.148
Just a few drops in her glass.

09:51.216 --> 09:52.350
In her glass.

09:52.351 --> 09:53.450
Just a few.

09:53.451 --> 09:55.018
Oh, Carol, honey, honey, please.

09:55.019 --> 09:55.851
Don't, don't, please.

09:55.852 --> 09:56.518
Okay.

09:56.519 --> 09:57.485
Come on. Come on.

09:57.486 --> 09:59.320
Let me get you out of here.

09:59.321 --> 10:00.788
Don't. It's okay.

10:00.789 --> 10:02.223
Come on.

10:02.224 --> 10:03.857
Maybe... maybe it

10:03.858 --> 10:05.458
wasn't even me.

10:05.459 --> 10:07.993
Maybe something else killed her.

10:08.061 --> 10:11.262
Come on. Come on, sweetheart. You okay?

10:11.263 --> 10:12.063
It's just a few...

10:12.064 --> 10:14.865
Everything's gonna be okay, okay?

10:17.661 --> 10:18.794
I know we met under

10:18.795 --> 10:19.861
difficult circumstances, but I

10:19.862 --> 10:21.896
appreciate these afternoons.

10:21.964 --> 10:24.431
They mean a lot to me, Tessa.

10:24.498 --> 10:25.865
Me, too.

10:25.866 --> 10:29.968
I'm so happy that we've taken
time to get to know each other.

10:29.969 --> 10:33.603
Thank you.

10:33.671 --> 10:36.672
What is it, dear?

10:39.075 --> 10:42.779
Patty Hewes contacted me.

10:42.847 --> 10:46.482
She wanted to know whether or not I
spent last Thanksgiving with my mom.

10:46.483 --> 10:47.616
Did you spend

10:47.617 --> 10:48.517
Thanksgiving with her?

10:48.518 --> 10:52.185
My mom made me promise
to never talk about it.

10:52.253 --> 10:54.553
Did you tell Patty?

10:54.620 --> 10:57.421
No.

10:57.489 --> 11:00.990
Louis was always so kind to me and my mom.

11:00.991 --> 11:02.490
Thanksgiving was the last time

11:02.491 --> 11:05.092
I ever saw him, and...

11:05.160 --> 11:08.094
I just don't want to
get anybody in trouble.

11:08.095 --> 11:11.896
If that's what your mother
wanted, you did the right thing.

11:13.665 --> 11:15.298
It's going to be fine.

11:15.299 --> 11:17.900
You're a good girl.

11:20.569 --> 11:24.271
Are you sure that this is okay with Joe?

11:24.272 --> 11:25.105
Yes.

11:25.106 --> 11:28.107
I spoke to him, and he's fine with it...

11:28.142 --> 11:29.776
as long as you don't tell the

11:29.777 --> 11:33.580
doctor anything about Danielle Marchetti.

11:35.217 --> 11:37.117
No, I won't.

11:37.152 --> 11:38.552
Good, good.

11:38.553 --> 11:43.159
Okay, so I'm going to
be waiting right here.

11:43.227 --> 11:44.226
As soon as you're finished, you

11:44.227 --> 11:46.195
come out, and I'll take you home.

11:46.196 --> 11:47.663
Okay.

11:47.664 --> 11:49.564
Thanks, Lenny.

11:49.566 --> 11:53.402
I just want you to feel better.

11:53.470 --> 11:55.471
And... and you will, too.

12:04.050 --> 12:05.150
Hey.

12:05.151 --> 12:06.384
How are you?

12:06.385 --> 12:07.118
Art, this is my

12:07.119 --> 12:07.852
producing partner Gail Sturmer.

12:07.853 --> 12:08.554
Nice to meet you.

12:08.555 --> 12:10.022
Ms. Sturmer, it's a real pleasure.

12:10.023 --> 12:11.357
Gail, please.

12:11.358 --> 12:12.791
I didn't realize how tall you are.

12:12.792 --> 12:14.126
And even more handsome in person.

12:14.127 --> 12:15.696
Hey, save that shit for the actors.

12:15.697 --> 12:17.998
We're the ones with the fragile egos.

12:17.999 --> 12:19.433
Yeah, he's not kidding.

12:19.434 --> 12:20.701
Wow. Beautiful space.

12:20.702 --> 12:21.802
Yeah. I love it.

12:21.803 --> 12:22.602
Come on in.

12:22.603 --> 12:23.469
Sit down.

12:23.470 --> 12:24.470
Thank you.

12:24.471 --> 12:26.570
Gail, why don't you sit right there?

12:26.571 --> 12:27.304
Thanks.

12:27.305 --> 12:30.272
So, how long have you
two been working together?

12:30.273 --> 12:32.607
Oh, almost 12 years now.

12:32.608 --> 12:36.208
- Since Underestimated.
- Underestimated, yeah.
- Yeah, what a great

12:36.209 --> 12:39.875
idea to have an alien and a...
and a mailman switch bodies.

12:39.943 --> 12:42.374
Yeah, we've come a long way, huh?

12:42.375 --> 12:43.142
Sure have.

12:43.143 --> 12:49.445
Now, this... ...is a tremendous book.

12:49.513 --> 12:51.113
Windy is deeply moving work.

12:51.114 --> 12:52.581
She can't stop talking about it.

12:52.582 --> 12:54.596
Well, thank you. I
really do appreciate that.

12:54.597 --> 12:58.286
No, it's true. See, blockbusters pay the bills,
but it's the smaller films that really excite us.

12:58.287 --> 12:59.457
Your story needs to be told.

12:59.458 --> 13:01.759
Look, to be honest, when
Terry first told me about

13:01.760 --> 13:03.294
this, I thought, "So what?"

13:03.295 --> 13:04.862
We'd seen it on CNN.

13:04.863 --> 13:06.630
We got hit over the head with it on Greta.

13:06.631 --> 13:09.665
But the truth is, we hadn't
been told the whole story.

13:09.666 --> 13:12.334
What... what do you mean?

13:12.335 --> 13:14.836
Well, your trial played out in
the press as completely one-sided.

13:14.837 --> 13:18.538
It was the corrupt corporate thief
and the do-good female lawyer.

13:18.539 --> 13:22.075
Your book throws that
watered-down bullshit on its head.

13:22.076 --> 13:23.676
We love the idea of
flipping the story around.

13:23.677 --> 13:24.343
Yeah.

13:24.344 --> 13:25.978
It's about a good man who
got caught up in something.

13:25.979 --> 13:26.645
Mm-hmm.

13:26.646 --> 13:27.312
He lost himself.

13:27.313 --> 13:27.980
Right.

13:27.981 --> 13:29.447
But now he's seeking redemption.

13:29.448 --> 13:34.552
Right, and the difference is, he
knows he's done something wrong.

13:34.619 --> 13:36.920
Patty Hewes is the real
villain, because she acts like

13:36.921 --> 13:40.824
it's about justice, but the
woman is pure Machiavellian evil.

13:40.825 --> 13:41.991
She got, what?

13:41.992 --> 13:44.526
20, 30 percent from that settlement?

13:44.527 --> 13:45.327
30 percent, but,

13:45.328 --> 13:47.729
you know, she's a...

13:47.797 --> 13:48.730
She was just doing what she was

13:48.731 --> 13:52.301
supposed to be doing, there. I
mean, she... she's not a mercenary.

13:52.302 --> 13:55.037
Patty has her own kind of integrity.

13:55.038 --> 13:55.704
Absolutely.

13:55.705 --> 13:56.404
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:56.405 --> 14:01.876
No, we'll find Patty's humanity and
we'll drive it through hard core.

14:01.944 --> 14:03.244
I have an idea.

14:03.245 --> 14:06.179
How would you like to meet
Patty, if I can set that up?

14:06.180 --> 14:08.382
- Shit, yeah. Love it.
- We'd love it.

14:08.383 --> 14:15.187
- Really? - Yeah. - All right. 'Cause
I think you guys need to meet her.

14:15.255 --> 14:18.856
I believe the last time I saw you
was just after your father died.

14:18.857 --> 14:22.782
I know this has been a
tumultuous time for you,

14:22.783 --> 14:24.527
made even more difficult

14:25.439 --> 14:26.214
by all the media attention.

14:29.299 --> 14:31.152
Yes. I don't get out of the house much.

14:32.246 --> 14:33.469
Have you been sleeping?

14:33.470 --> 14:35.570
Not really.

14:35.638 --> 14:37.872
Any loss of appetite?

14:37.873 --> 14:41.161
Inability to experience enjoyment?

14:43.651 --> 14:44.387
I would say both.

14:45.415 --> 14:47.618
Well, it's certainly not surprising,

14:47.619 --> 14:49.676
given your situation,

14:51.012 --> 14:57.155
that you would be experiencing increased
levels of both anxiety and depression.

15:03.060 --> 15:06.328
Is there anything you want to talk about?

15:06.330 --> 15:09.865
Look, can you just write me a
prescription and call it a day?

15:09.866 --> 15:11.033
Carol.

15:11.034 --> 15:12.367
I'm not a pill dispenser.

15:12.368 --> 15:15.737
If you need a prescription,
I'll write one for you.

15:15.738 --> 15:19.340
But with the symptoms that
you are experiencing, it is

15:19.341 --> 15:23.476
important that you talk
about what's bothering you.

15:27.580 --> 15:29.247
Okay.

15:29.248 --> 15:31.215
All right.

15:31.282 --> 15:36.651
So, has anything else happened lately?

15:40.055 --> 15:47.125
Has there been any other concern that has
increased your level of emotional distress?

15:53.663 --> 15:57.898
I can't help if you don't
tell me what's going on.

16:01.968 --> 16:04.401
Doctor?

16:04.469 --> 16:06.469
Yes?

16:09.939 --> 16:11.939
There's nothing else.

16:15.409 --> 16:17.910
All right.

16:17.978 --> 16:21.112
I'm giving you something
to ease your anxiety.

16:21.180 --> 16:27.919
But on the condition that you
come in next week and see me again.

16:31.557 --> 16:35.127
You need to start talking, Carol.

16:40.704 --> 16:42.238
Malcolm called.

16:42.239 --> 16:44.341
Carol finally left the apartment.

16:44.342 --> 16:45.476
Winstone came by to pick her up.

16:45.477 --> 16:46.376
Where'd he take her?

16:46.377 --> 16:49.279
To a shrink.

16:49.347 --> 16:51.648
Did Malcolm get the
name of the psychiatrist?

16:51.649 --> 16:52.915
Dr. Maurice Samuels.

16:52.916 --> 16:54.483
Upper West Side.

16:54.484 --> 16:56.551
He dropped her off, waited in his car.

16:56.552 --> 16:58.786
When she was done, he took
her straight back to the loft.

16:58.787 --> 17:00.321
He's not letting her out of his sight.

17:00.322 --> 17:02.789
Yeah, it seems that way.

17:02.790 --> 17:05.125
If we can't get to Carol
directly, we're going to

17:05.126 --> 17:06.425
have to go through her doctor.

17:06.426 --> 17:08.361
What about patient confidentiality?

17:08.362 --> 17:11.663
There are ways around that.

17:58.236 --> 18:00.236
Corey?

18:03.641 --> 18:05.241
Corey, where are you, boy?

18:05.242 --> 18:06.508
I let myself in.

18:06.509 --> 18:08.942
I hope it's okay.

18:09.010 --> 18:12.510
I didn't know you still
had your keys, Michael.

18:16.481 --> 18:19.082
I'm having a baby.

18:19.150 --> 18:21.151
Really?

18:21.219 --> 18:23.219
Really.

18:28.591 --> 18:31.026
You don't seem very surprised.

18:31.027 --> 18:33.463
I'm processing it.

18:37.743 --> 18:38.467
Or maybe you already knew.

18:38.968 --> 18:41.836
How would I know if you didn't tell me?

18:41.837 --> 18:46.585
It doesn't matter. Uh,
I owe you an apology.

18:47.969 --> 18:50.041
That day we had lunch, I lied to you.

18:50.042 --> 18:54.536
I don't have an office job. I'm
painting. And I didn't break up with Jill.

18:55.937 --> 18:59.253
- So, Jill is the mother?
- Yeah.

18:59.949 --> 19:01.717
Lovely.

19:01.785 --> 19:04.753
Why did you lie?

19:04.821 --> 19:08.117
Uh, I wasn't in the
mood for your judgment.

19:10.918 --> 19:13.311
I don't want you to take
this the wrong way...

19:15.396 --> 19:17.563
but are you sure that you are

19:17.631 --> 19:26.170
- the father?
- Definitely. Anyway, I need to talk to you

19:26.171 --> 19:30.661
because our genetic counselor has some
questions about my family background.

19:30.662 --> 19:33.142
- Is there a problem?
- It's routine.

19:33.143 --> 19:41.015
They're looking for chromosomal abnormalities. My
real dad's in jail, so... I figured I'd ask you.

19:41.083 --> 19:43.851
You were the same age as Jill

19:43.919 --> 19:46.053
when you had me, weren't you?

19:46.121 --> 19:47.621
I guess I was.

19:47.622 --> 19:49.255
Were there any problems?

19:49.256 --> 19:50.957
No.

19:50.958 --> 19:52.492
You were an easy baby.

19:52.493 --> 19:55.861
What about before me?

19:55.929 --> 19:57.929
Any miscarriages or anything?

20:00.766 --> 20:02.666
No.

20:02.667 --> 20:05.702
What about the other women in your family?

20:07.771 --> 20:11.607
Michael, you know I haven't
talked to anyone for over 40 years.

20:11.608 --> 20:13.342
Well, what about Uncle Pete?

20:13.343 --> 20:14.376
What about him?

20:14.377 --> 20:17.444
You never told me how he died.

20:17.512 --> 20:21.849
He died of natural causes.

20:21.916 --> 20:23.849
Are you okay, Mom?

20:23.917 --> 20:25.817
I'm fine.

20:25.851 --> 20:28.019
Next question?

20:28.086 --> 20:28.953
It's all right.

20:28.954 --> 20:29.753
Look.

20:29.754 --> 20:31.255
Here's a checklist.

20:31.256 --> 20:32.589
Go through it on your own time.

20:32.590 --> 20:33.656
I can do it right now.

20:33.657 --> 20:34.924
It's no big deal.

20:34.925 --> 20:37.259
Just, uh, leave it with the
doorman in the next few days,

20:37.260 --> 20:41.129
and I will swing by and pick it up.

20:42.798 --> 20:44.799
Thanks, Mom.

21:31.909 --> 21:34.244
I was happy to hear from you.

21:34.245 --> 21:38.180
Last time we spoke, you didn't
seem ready for a remodel.

21:38.248 --> 21:40.815
I'm still deliberating.

21:40.816 --> 21:42.483
May I see the plans?

21:42.484 --> 21:44.485
Sure.

21:53.560 --> 21:57.762
Doesn't seem that different
from what's here now.

21:57.830 --> 22:00.764
As I explained before,
the real value of the

22:00.832 --> 22:04.600
apartment is behind the walls.

22:06.035 --> 22:07.302
You never know what we might

22:07.303 --> 22:09.304
find if we, uh, tear them down.

22:12.575 --> 22:15.176
What do you think?

22:15.244 --> 22:17.879
Well, it'd certainly be a change.

22:17.880 --> 22:19.881
Isn't that the point?

22:22.919 --> 22:23.886
It's a big decision.

22:23.887 --> 22:25.888
I understand.

22:29.331 --> 22:32.035
But you've made big
decisions before, right?

22:33.934 --> 22:37.172
I'll let you know, Mr. Decker.

22:37.240 --> 22:39.007
Please do.

22:39.008 --> 22:40.542
Have yourself a good night now.

22:40.543 --> 22:42.544
Mm-hmm.

22:50.981 --> 22:58.550
- Thank you.
- Mom.
- Thank you for letting me meet you at work.

22:58.551 --> 23:00.918
I didn't know what to do.

23:00.986 --> 23:05.554
It's okay, it's okay. Let's,
uh, let's go through here.

23:07.723 --> 23:09.756
I knew something was wrong
when your sister didn't

23:09.757 --> 23:12.789
- come to pick up Charlotte.
- How is Dad handling all of this?

23:12.790 --> 23:13.624
How do you think?

23:13.625 --> 23:16.886
He's furious. She can't go to jail, Ellen.

23:16.887 --> 23:18.971
You know Carrie. Sh...
she's not strong enough.

23:18.972 --> 23:20.161
Can't you do something?

23:20.162 --> 23:20.866
Like what?

23:20.867 --> 23:23.350
You work for the DA. Talk
to someone, make it go away.

23:23.496 --> 23:25.197
Mom, she committed a felony.

23:25.198 --> 23:29.306
- Carrie's name is in the system now.
- This is your sister we're talking about.

23:29.307 --> 23:32.842
This is not some criminal off
the street you never met before.

23:32.910 --> 23:36.912
- I know, but there are rules.
- So you're willing to sit by and... and just let her

23:36.913 --> 23:39.113
- suffer?
- No, that's not what I'm saying.

23:39.114 --> 23:40.982
If she goes to jail, she
will lose her daughter.

23:40.983 --> 23:41.782
I understand that.

23:41.783 --> 23:43.117
Her life will be ruined.

23:43.118 --> 23:43.984
Mom, listen to me.

23:43.985 --> 23:47.320
Carrie has never had a chance.

23:47.388 --> 23:49.389
What do you mean?

23:49.457 --> 23:51.324
I've never been able to protect her.

23:51.325 --> 23:52.392
I still can't.

23:52.393 --> 23:55.461
I'm helpless.

23:55.529 --> 23:57.362
It's gonna be okay.

23:57.363 --> 23:59.531
I need you.

24:01.768 --> 24:02.968
All right.

24:02.969 --> 24:06.538
All right, I'll see what I can do.

24:37.498 --> 24:40.366
I should've seen this coming.

24:40.367 --> 24:42.823
It's Hollywood, Dad. You're
not gonna change them.

24:42.824 --> 24:45.620
They're gonna try to make
Patty Hewes the villain.

24:46.921 --> 24:48.739
Jeez, you know, I
worked hard on this book.

24:48.740 --> 24:50.273
I really tried to be honest and

24:50.274 --> 24:51.741
dig deep within myself, and now

24:51.742 --> 24:56.076
they're gonna turn it into
another piece of phony crap.

24:56.144 --> 25:00.027
She did try to destroy you.
I thought you hated her.

25:00.028 --> 25:03.645
I did at the time. But that was
before I worked through my shit.

25:03.646 --> 25:05.113
You know, I was still in...

25:05.114 --> 25:07.314
I was still in denial.

25:07.382 --> 25:09.082
You know, anyway, I'm not saying

25:09.083 --> 25:10.883
she's not flawed, but so am I.

25:10.884 --> 25:14.621
That's, you know, that's the whole
point I was trying to make in the book.

25:14.622 --> 25:15.788
Right.

25:15.789 --> 25:17.556
But it's your story.

25:17.557 --> 25:18.824
You're the protagonist.

25:18.825 --> 25:21.259
Oh, what's that supposed to mean?

25:21.260 --> 25:24.928
So there has to be an
antagonist... the opposing force.

25:24.996 --> 25:26.797
Well, yeah, all right.

25:26.798 --> 25:27.564
But that doesn't mean that

25:27.565 --> 25:29.466
everything has to be
black and white, right?

25:29.467 --> 25:33.151
I mean, life is complicated,
Owen. We live in the gray areas.

25:34.502 --> 25:36.905
- Not in Hollywood.
- If we're gonna get this right, those people are

25:36.906 --> 25:39.841
gonna have to understand the nuances.

25:39.842 --> 25:42.843
I wouldn't count on that happening.

25:42.911 --> 25:47.547
Well, that... that's why I'm trying to set this
meeting up with Patty. You know, hopefully, they'll

25:47.548 --> 25:50.116
see what she's really like,
you know, and they'll realize

25:50.117 --> 25:54.052
that we have to make this
movie, you know, thoughtful and

25:54.120 --> 25:57.471
balanced and fair. Has to be fair.

25:58.337 --> 25:58.996
And if they don't?

26:00.896 --> 26:04.461
Well, then they don't get to
make my goddamn movie, do they?

26:09.932 --> 26:12.967
Found the latest session
notes for Carol Tobin.

26:13.035 --> 26:16.636
Situational depression, anxiety.

26:16.703 --> 26:18.337
What'd he put her on?

26:18.338 --> 26:20.071
There's a copy of a new prescription.

26:20.072 --> 26:22.573
How often does she see Dr. Samuels?

26:22.574 --> 26:25.508
Before this last visit, she hadn't
been to see him in a couple of months.

26:25.509 --> 26:29.711
Now he wants to see her once a week.

26:40.285 --> 26:41.385
Hello.

26:41.386 --> 26:42.552
Mr. Winstone?

26:42.553 --> 26:43.853
Speaking.

26:43.854 --> 26:45.421
This is Dr. Maurice Samuels.

26:45.422 --> 26:47.322
Sorry to bother you.

26:47.324 --> 26:48.024
No bother.

26:48.025 --> 26:49.227
What can I do for you?

26:49.228 --> 26:51.128
A patient... Carol Tobin...

26:51.134 --> 26:52.801
isn't returning my calls.

26:52.802 --> 26:55.837
I see she's listed you
as her emergency contact.

26:55.838 --> 26:56.504
Yes.

26:56.505 --> 26:57.171
Sure.

26:57.172 --> 26:59.707
I think it would be a good
idea for Carol to check in with

26:59.708 --> 27:01.876
me even before her next appointment.

27:01.877 --> 27:04.446
I'd like to see her in person,
schedule some blood work.

27:04.447 --> 27:06.548
When would you like this to happen?

27:06.549 --> 27:07.849
How's Saturday?

27:07.850 --> 27:09.384
Maybe 2:00?

27:09.385 --> 27:12.522
I'll make sure she's there.

27:12.590 --> 27:16.862
- Thank you, Doctor.
- You're welcome, Mr. Winstone.

27:18.931 --> 27:24.201
Do you have a minute? Just needed
some perspective on something.

27:24.202 --> 27:28.004
All right.

27:28.072 --> 27:33.976
- My sister was arrested.
- I'm sorry. Uh, what's the charge?

27:34.044 --> 27:35.611
Intent to distribute.

27:35.612 --> 27:40.515
Meth. Jeez. That's, uh...

27:40.582 --> 27:45.018
- I'm sorry, Ellen.
- It's very serious. That's why I wanted to, uh, talk to you.

27:45.019 --> 27:47.786
Don't get involved.

27:47.854 --> 27:50.722
It wouldn't just reflect on you.

27:50.789 --> 27:51.689
I understand.

27:51.690 --> 27:56.325
And I certainly can't intervene.

27:56.393 --> 27:57.159
I know.

27:57.160 --> 27:59.960
I was...

28:00.028 --> 28:02.529
I was just wondering, what would you do?

28:02.530 --> 28:03.730
What would I do?

28:03.731 --> 28:04.397
Yeah.

28:04.398 --> 28:07.766
If it... if it was your sister.

28:07.834 --> 28:10.901
Honestly, if it was my sister,
I would get the biggest,

28:10.902 --> 28:15.214
baddest prick of a prosecutor I could find,
and I'd tell him to go for the jugular.

28:16.215 --> 28:18.640
- Why?
- Because I'd want to keep my career.

28:18.641 --> 28:23.151
And I know that if there were even
a hint of favoritism, I'm dead.

28:24.310 --> 28:27.930
-  Clear?
- Clear.

28:34.318 --> 28:37.853
It could also be the best thing for her.

29:18.280 --> 29:19.879
Hey, Patty.

29:19.880 --> 29:20.712
Arthur.

29:20.713 --> 29:22.147
Great to see you again.

29:22.148 --> 29:25.084
Um, I'd like to introduce, uh, Ga... um...

29:25.085 --> 29:25.817
Gail Sturmer.

29:25.818 --> 29:26.485
Hello.

29:26.486 --> 29:27.252
Nice to meet you.

29:27.253 --> 29:29.723
And I bet you probably recognize
Terry from all of his movies.

29:29.724 --> 29:30.624
Hi.

29:30.625 --> 29:31.659
Of course.

29:31.660 --> 29:33.727
Please, have a seat.

29:33.795 --> 29:38.365
So, um, thank you so much
for letting us do this.

29:38.366 --> 29:42.033
These guys, uh, know about our
trial obviously from the press.

29:42.034 --> 29:45.667
But I wanted them to meet you
in person, you know, see who

29:45.668 --> 29:48.501
you... you really are, you
know, what makes you tick.

29:48.502 --> 29:51.270
It's a thrill, Ms. Hewes, truly.

29:51.271 --> 29:54.139
So this is where it all happens, huh?

29:54.140 --> 29:57.643
I was... I was telling them earlier
about, uh, last time I was here.

29:57.644 --> 29:59.645
Do you remember it?

30:01.648 --> 30:03.816
The... the UNR case.

30:03.884 --> 30:06.451
I'm surprised you'd want to bring that up.

30:06.452 --> 30:09.254
Oh, ri...

30:09.255 --> 30:10.555
Case got complicated.

30:10.556 --> 30:15.326
Last minute, I was forced to
drop out as Patty's key plaintiff.

30:15.327 --> 30:17.027
That's what she...

30:17.028 --> 30:21.597
Oh, well, those moments are what
make your relationship so compelling.

30:21.598 --> 30:24.666
Bitter enemies struggling to put their

30:24.667 --> 30:28.302
differences aside for the greater good.

30:28.369 --> 30:32.338
- I understand you're gonna play
the role of Arthur Frobisher.
- I got halfway through

30:32.339 --> 30:35.475
Arthur's book, and I
just knew... had to be me.

30:35.542 --> 30:37.777
Yeah, let me, uh, let me jump in here just

30:37.778 --> 30:41.980
for a second, thanks. This story
is not just about myself, Patty.

30:41.981 --> 30:43.581
I do not, I promise you, see

30:43.582 --> 30:45.850
myself as... as the hero of this thing.

30:45.851 --> 30:46.517
No?

30:46.518 --> 30:47.851
No. No, no, no.

30:47.852 --> 30:48.952
My greatest fear... and I've

30:48.953 --> 30:50.921
told these guys this... that if

30:50.989 --> 30:57.795
this film were to oversimplify things... see,
the... the Patty Hewes character has to be living,

30:57.830 --> 31:01.032
breathing, three-dimensional.

31:01.100 --> 31:03.000
That's why I wanted to, uh,

31:03.035 --> 31:04.302
get us all together, so we could

31:04.303 --> 31:07.472
chat, get to know each other.

31:09.809 --> 31:13.378
Well, here we are.

31:14.847 --> 31:24.588
See, to me, you are the hero of
this story. If it weren't for you, I

31:24.589 --> 31:27.324
would've kept grabbing for more.

31:27.392 --> 31:29.927
But you cut me down.

31:29.995 --> 31:34.965
You forced change. And frankly,
you brought me to a better place.

31:35.032 --> 31:40.935
Shit, I... I... I couldn't
be more grateful to you.

31:40.936 --> 31:46.641
We see the, um, Frobisher
trial as a epic tale of rebirth.

31:46.642 --> 31:51.112
A true-life story of redemption.

31:51.180 --> 31:52.432
Redemption?

31:55.517 --> 32:00.603
Well, there certainly hasn't been any
redemption for the countless workers

32:00.604 --> 32:03.641
whose lives Arthur ruined.

32:07.025 --> 32:10.128
Or for Ray Fiske, the attorney
who put a bullet through his

32:10.129 --> 32:12.563
head because of Arthur's scandals.

32:12.564 --> 32:18.734
Patty. All of it will
be part of the story.

32:18.802 --> 32:25.373
Patty, why don't you, uh, why don't you tell
us about the Arthur Frobisher that you know.

32:27.443 --> 32:29.260
The Arthur Frobisher that I know?

32:30.622 --> 32:36.093
Foolish, vain......pathetically insecure.

32:37.494 --> 32:40.615
The Arthur Frobisher that I
know is a despicable bully.

32:40.789 --> 32:41.788
Hey, Patty, I...

32:41.789 --> 32:45.291
He stole from his employees,
then he manipulated

32:45.292 --> 32:49.542
the system to escape life in
prison with a slap on the wrist.

32:51.561 --> 32:54.181
But... that's just me.

32:56.371 --> 32:58.039
Do whatever you want.

32:58.040 --> 33:02.043
I don't much like movies, anyway.

33:04.312 --> 33:09.279
So, I'm gonna be right here
in the car. And when you're

33:09.280 --> 33:13.445
done, I'll take you someplace
nice for lunch, all right?

33:24.347 --> 33:31.071
- Hello, Miss Tobin.
- What are you doing here?

33:31.072 --> 33:34.766
I wanted to talk to you.

33:37.766 --> 33:46.239
- Look... my attorney is right outside, waiting for me.
- Does he know you

33:46.240 --> 33:50.843
killed Danielle Marchetti?

33:50.911 --> 33:57.082
Luckily for you, I can't prove it.
Yet. But I could have a conversation

33:57.083 --> 33:58.817
with the District Attorney.

33:58.818 --> 34:02.686
He's looking for any reason
to throw a Tobin into jail.

34:05.657 --> 34:09.125
What do you want?

34:09.193 --> 34:12.762
Sit down.

34:19.735 --> 34:24.838
I want to know what
happened on Thanksgiving.

34:28.775 --> 34:30.443
I spoke to Carol Tobin.

34:30.444 --> 34:31.944
How did that go?

34:31.945 --> 34:38.248
She is a very troubled girl, but hopefully
she can get some information for us.

34:38.317 --> 34:41.418
I don't know if you know this, but...

34:41.420 --> 34:44.187
I've got a hole in my wall?

34:44.188 --> 34:46.621
I'm thinking of renovating.

34:46.690 --> 34:49.925
To do it right, you have
to tear the drywall off.

34:49.926 --> 34:51.426
Why?

34:51.427 --> 34:55.129
Well, apparently, there's
something of interest behind there.

34:55.130 --> 34:58.731
You know, like old
factory brick or whatever.

34:58.799 --> 35:01.733
It just looks like a hole.

35:01.734 --> 35:06.268
So, what did you want
to speak to me about?

35:10.204 --> 35:13.104
Um, I hate coming to you
with a problem like this.

35:13.105 --> 35:15.572
But...

35:15.640 --> 35:18.408
What is it?

35:18.475 --> 35:21.009
My sister...

35:21.077 --> 35:23.544
I need a favor.

35:26.914 --> 35:28.581
Hey...

35:28.582 --> 35:32.984
- How are you feeling?
- Better.
- I'm glad to hear that.

35:32.985 --> 35:36.919
Yeah, I'm good.

35:36.987 --> 35:45.358
- I keep thinking about Dad, though. I miss him.
- I miss him, too.

35:49.328 --> 35:58.900
- I'm trying to make sense of everything
that's happened, but... it's hard.
- I know.

35:58.968 --> 36:08.273
The doctor said it would help if I could talk about
it, but... obviously I can't tell him the truth.

36:10.843 --> 36:13.611
So, talk to me.

36:19.215 --> 36:24.185
Why did we go to Danielle
Marchetti's that night?

36:24.252 --> 36:26.085
When?

36:26.086 --> 36:27.553
Thanksgiving.

36:27.554 --> 36:29.054
Wait here, okay?

36:29.055 --> 36:29.988
Where are you going?

36:29.989 --> 36:33.224
I just have to pick something up.

36:36.428 --> 36:38.828
What did you have to get there?

36:38.829 --> 36:41.096
The night he confessed,
your father asked me

36:41.097 --> 36:48.668
to clear out Danielle's apartment. He didn't
want to leave behind any trace of his affair.

36:48.736 --> 36:52.737
What was in the bag?

36:52.805 --> 36:56.340
Your father's boots and
the cell phone that he and

36:56.407 --> 36:58.307
Danielle used to talk on.

36:59.176 --> 37:11.361
- I'm sorry, Carol. Your father was
ashamed. He asked me to do it.
- Who was the girl?

37:13.600 --> 37:15.234
Which girl?

37:15.235 --> 37:19.073
The girl who gave you the bag.

37:25.952 --> 37:27.852
Thank you, Tessa.

37:27.859 --> 37:30.264
Happy Thanksgiving.

37:30.332 --> 37:34.578
I never met her before.

37:34.646 --> 37:37.349
I think she was someone
your father had hired to help

37:37.350 --> 37:40.689
Danielle around the house.

37:44.494 --> 37:45.494
Water, right?

37:45.495 --> 37:46.495
Thank you.

37:46.496 --> 37:49.131
Well, that was absolutely genius.

37:49.132 --> 37:50.065
Yeah...

37:50.066 --> 37:51.866
I am so happy you introduced us, man.

37:51.867 --> 37:53.368
You cannot make that woman up.

37:53.369 --> 37:55.135
I mean, if you wrote that,
no one would believe it.

37:55.136 --> 37:55.968
Yeah, I know.

37:55.969 --> 37:56.702
I told you guys, right?

37:56.703 --> 37:57.369
Yes!

37:57.370 --> 38:01.205
I mean, you have to see her in person to
see just how big a bitch she really is.

38:01.206 --> 38:03.472
I'm now twice as excited
about this project.

38:03.473 --> 38:06.140
Good. See, that... that's
what I wanted you to see.

38:06.141 --> 38:07.641
I mean, you can try to reason

38:07.642 --> 38:08.942
with that woman all you want.

38:08.943 --> 38:12.045
It... it's just always all about her.

38:12.046 --> 38:13.146
I mean, did you see her?

38:13.147 --> 38:14.814
She can't help but stick the knife in.

38:14.815 --> 38:15.481
Did you see that?

38:15.482 --> 38:16.148
Yes!

38:16.149 --> 38:18.183
And you were worried about
portraying her humanity.

38:18.184 --> 38:22.087
Oh, screw her humanity.

38:22.155 --> 38:26.592
She's gonna make a great villain.

38:26.660 --> 38:28.827
Don't you think?

38:31.798 --> 38:37.370
So, after your father confessed on
Thanksgiving, you didn't go home?

38:37.437 --> 38:39.338
No, I... I was too upset.

38:39.406 --> 38:41.306
I went to see our lawyer.

38:41.307 --> 38:42.707
Leonard Winstone?

38:42.708 --> 38:44.075
Yes.

38:44.076 --> 38:49.246
And he got a call, so we drove over
to Danielle Marchetti's apartment.

38:49.247 --> 38:51.615
To do what?

38:51.683 --> 38:55.351
Um, Lenny had to pick up
some of my dad's things.

38:55.386 --> 38:58.421
What kind of things?

38:58.489 --> 39:03.093
Some boots, a cell phone...
it was a bag of stuff.

39:03.161 --> 39:08.434
Lenny had to get rid of it to
hide my dad's affair with Danielle.

39:08.435 --> 39:10.937
Did you see who gave Mr. Winstone the bag?

39:10.938 --> 39:14.207
Lenny said it was Danielle
Marchetti's housekeeper.

39:14.208 --> 39:17.843
What did she look like?

39:17.911 --> 39:24.049
She was young, kinda short... in her 20s.

39:28.321 --> 39:33.225
Is this the woman you saw?

39:33.293 --> 39:35.628
Yes, that could be her.

39:35.629 --> 39:37.630
Why? Who is she?

39:37.697 --> 39:51.644
- She's Danielle Marchetti's housekeeper.
Mr. Winstone was telling you the truth.
- Of course he was. So, can I go now?

39:51.712 --> 39:53.312
Yes.

39:53.313 --> 39:55.280
Thank you, Miss Tobin.

39:55.348 --> 39:56.348
Thanks.

39:56.349 --> 39:57.349
Yeah.

39:57.350 --> 40:14.453
- Appreciate it.
- So, Tessa Marchetti spent Thanksgiving with her mother. Apparently.

40:14.520 --> 40:16.694
So, why is she lying to us?

40:45.761 --> 40:46.761
I just, uh... uh...

40:46.762 --> 40:48.195
wanted to tell you that I...

40:48.196 --> 40:50.096
I love you.
