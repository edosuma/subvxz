           My target?
      Shea garcia-miller.

07:32.152 --> 07:35.020
        - No, it's not!
 I did--I just gave her advice!

07:35.022 --> 07:38.824
   - You told her point blank
     to go after my money!

07:38.826 --> 07:40.992
             You...

07:40.994 --> 07:42.594
      Scratched my teflon.

07:42.596 --> 07:44.863
          It was you.

07:44.865 --> 07:50.101
 And you are going to fix this.

07:50.103 --> 07:52.571
      Fix this right now!

07:55.843 --> 07:59.244
       - [clears throat]

07:59.246 --> 08:01.046
            Stacey?

08:01.048 --> 08:03.715
     Hi, you probably don't
          remember me.

08:03.717 --> 08:05.650
            - Fiona!
            - Whoa!

08:05.652 --> 08:07.752
Strong little thing, aren't you?
         - Oh, my god!

08:07.754 --> 08:09.621
   Of course I remember you.

08:09.623 --> 08:12.557
       How could I forget
    the woman who literally

08:12.559 --> 08:13.892
 Changed the course of my life?

08:13.894 --> 08:16.661
        - Did I? Did I?
           - You did.

08:16.663 --> 08:19.731
      I mean, you are such
         a wise woman.

08:19.733 --> 08:21.533
 - Oh, that's very kind of you.

08:21.535 --> 08:22.968
    I mean, really I'm just,
           you know,

08:22.970 --> 08:24.903
           A conduit
   for the wisdom of others.

08:24.905 --> 08:27.539
      - You're so modest.
 No, literally, because of you,

08:27.541 --> 08:30.809
   I have completely changed
     the course of my life.

08:30.811 --> 08:33.645
 I mean, I'm no longer looking
     for mindless hookups.

08:33.647 --> 08:34.980
           Thank god.
            - Good.

08:34.982 --> 08:37.782
- And I'm just focusing on what
       I really deserve.

08:37.784 --> 08:38.783
            - Aw...

08:38.784 --> 08:40.751
            - Money.
             - Oh.

08:40.754 --> 08:43.288
 - And you helped me see that.

08:43.289 --> 08:46.892
  - Well, if I could offer up
    another piece of wisdom?

08:46.894 --> 08:48.159
            - Sure.
            - Um...

08:48.161 --> 08:52.831
   When I said that I thought
       you deserved more,

08:52.833 --> 08:55.967
      I meant emotionally.

08:55.969 --> 08:58.270
         - Emotionally?
      - Yeah, emotionally.

08:58.272 --> 09:00.038
        Not financially.

09:00.040 --> 09:02.807
You see, when I said you should
      value yourself more,

09:02.809 --> 09:04.075
      That's what I meant.

09:04.077 --> 09:06.778
         - Emotionally,
      and not financially.

09:06.780 --> 09:07.879
     - Yeah, you see that?

09:07.881 --> 09:09.948
     Now you're getting it.
        Well done, you!

09:09.950 --> 09:11.950
          - I get it.

09:11.952 --> 09:15.820
      You're here because
   will sent you, aren't you?

09:15.822 --> 09:18.757
  You are here to talk me out
        of the lawsuit.

09:18.759 --> 09:20.692
       - Well, and to do
       a bit of pilates.

          Stiff neck.

09:23.230 --> 09:26.131
     - Arms in the straps,
       everyone, please.

09:26.133 --> 09:28.700
  Um, we're gonna start class
      on our backs today.

09:28.702 --> 09:31.570
     It's gonna be a very,
      very intense class.

     on such short notice.

09:36.843 --> 09:40.779
      My helpless victims
 of wrongful eviction can wait.

09:40.781 --> 09:42.914
 Way more important to help you
deal with the groupie gone wild.

09:42.916 --> 09:44.082
        Get off my desk.

09:44.084 --> 09:46.718
     - Okay, hostile vibe,
        I'm feeling it.

09:46.720 --> 09:48.286
             Okay?
          Registered.

09:48.288 --> 09:49.788
  But I just want you to take
      a quick look at this

09:49.790 --> 09:53.358
  And tell me that this stacey
      is just a wack-a-doo

09:53.360 --> 09:54.893
      With, uh, you know,
         no real case.

09:54.895 --> 09:57.862
      - Is this wack-a-doo
        a former lover?

09:57.864 --> 09:59.764
   - I wouldn't say "lover."

09:59.766 --> 10:03.301
   I mean, we had a, roughly,
       eight-night stand

10:03.303 --> 10:05.337
       Back when I wrote
    my platinum hit single.

10:05.339 --> 10:06.771
 - You better hope this doesn't
          go to trial.

10:06.773 --> 10:08.239
        Get off my desk.
        - Okay, listen.

10:08.241 --> 10:09.808
         I'm not saying
 I was a gentleman, all right?

10:09.810 --> 10:11.943
     - Gentleman? [scoffs]
  I've defended serial killers

10:11.945 --> 10:13.645
   That were more sympathetic
           than you.

10:13.647 --> 10:15.714
   - Fine. I admit it, okay?
          I admit it.

10:15.716 --> 10:17.182
  I was a bit of a lady-killer
           back then.

10:17.184 --> 10:20.051
 But I promise you that she had
     nothing, and I repeat,

10:20.053 --> 10:21.987
   Nothing to do with writing
           this song.

10:21.989 --> 10:24.055
 So I just need you to tell me
           that this

10:24.057 --> 10:26.825
   Is much ado about nothing,
    that it's just a drawing

10:26.827 --> 10:28.293
    In the sand that'll be,
           you know,

10:28.295 --> 10:30.362
   Washed away with the tide.

10:30.364 --> 10:32.397
       - Do you even hear
       the steaming crap

10:32.399 --> 10:34.065
      That just falls out
         of your mouth?

10:34.067 --> 10:35.333
  - That was a solid metaphor.

10:35.335 --> 10:37.268
    - Okay, get off my desk!

10:37.270 --> 10:38.269
       Sit in the chair.

10:38.271 --> 10:42.874
 Your bedside manner needs some
       serious attention.

10:42.876 --> 10:44.809
      - It doesn't matter
        how wack-a-doo,

10:44.811 --> 10:47.245
    Or to use an adult word,
      meritless her case.

10:47.247 --> 10:49.114
 This thing could still drag on
           for years.

10:49.116 --> 10:51.216
         - Years? What?
             - Oh!

10:51.218 --> 10:53.752
     She's not just looking
       for future checks.

10:53.754 --> 10:54.986
   She wants back royalties.

10:54.988 --> 10:56.988
   This girl means business.
       - Back royalties?

10:56.990 --> 10:58.757
       She can't do that.
        That's not fair.

10:58.759 --> 11:04.195

11:08.835 --> 11:13.438
  About my hair for one second
  and just tell me what to do?

11:13.440 --> 11:16.841
  - The best thing you can do
     right now is nothing.

11:16.843 --> 11:18.276
Do not reach out to this woman.

11:18.278 --> 11:20.245
          No contact.
             Zero.

11:23.683 --> 11:25.684

     even if it's so tough

11:25.686 --> 11:27.986

       might fall apart.

           too wide,

      Because that is how
         you get hurt,

14:58.932 --> 15:01.532
 - You're not an idiot, marcus.
            - I am.

15:01.534 --> 15:02.934
     And I'm used to people
       calling me names,

15:02.936 --> 15:09.007
       Like dweeb, loser,
         fart nugget...

15:09.009 --> 15:13.144
         But when shea
     called me a stalker...

15:13.146 --> 15:15.380
 Will, you don't have any idea
         what it's like

15:15.382 --> 15:20.251
 To have someone you care about
 make you feel like a monster.

15:24.390 --> 15:27.392
           - Stacey.

15:27.394 --> 15:29.460
           Hi. Uh...

15:29.462 --> 15:31.296
        You're looking--
      you're looking wel--

15:31.298 --> 15:32.931
      You're looking very,
         very healthy.

15:32.933 --> 15:34.966
 - What can I do for you, will?

15:34.968 --> 15:38.703
      - Uh, well, I was...
        [clears throat]

15:38.705 --> 15:43.007
  Hoping that we could...Talk.

15:43.009 --> 15:44.709
          - Hmm. Well,
     let me think about it.

15:44.711 --> 15:47.712
   Um, no, I'm not interested
       in talking, okay?

15:47.714 --> 15:50.715
   All you're gonna do is try
 to tell me to drop my lawsuit,

15:50.717 --> 15:53.251
     And I'm not interested
    in dropping my lawsuit.

15:53.253 --> 15:54.652
   - I wasn't gonna tell you
          to do that.

15:54.654 --> 15:55.954
      I--really, I just--

15:55.956 --> 15:58.022
     I would like to talk,
        just you and me.

15:58.024 --> 16:00.358
  - You know what, this isn't
  a therapist's office, will.

16:00.360 --> 16:02.527
   This is a pilates studio.

16:02.529 --> 16:06.030
    So if you want to talk,
     then get on a machine.

16:06.032 --> 16:09.667
 - Oh, no, I--well, I actually
    just did abs, you know?

16:09.669 --> 16:11.569
And they're barking pretty good.

16:11.571 --> 16:14.739
       - Well, then we're
        not gonna talk.

16:14.741 --> 16:15.740
            - Okay.

16:15.742 --> 16:17.642
         What do I do,
        I just sit on--

16:17.644 --> 16:19.744
         Just sit down
     on this bad boy here?

16:19.746 --> 16:22.146
   - No, that's way too easy.

16:22.148 --> 16:24.716
Let's get you going on that guy.

16:24.718 --> 16:27.118
    - Oh, the strappy thing.

16:27.120 --> 16:28.386
    Are you sure about that?

16:28.388 --> 16:30.688
          - Positive.

16:30.690 --> 16:32.323
            - Okay.

16:32.325 --> 16:34.659
     Yeah, this is a little
           dungeon-y.

16:34.661 --> 16:37.996
   I'll put my hands in these
   fuzzy little friends here.

16:37.998 --> 16:39.464
    Oh, yeah, you're right.
  You know, I can already feel

16:39.466 --> 16:41.332
   My core kind of firing up.

16:41.334 --> 16:42.767
              Ahh.
    Doesn't seem too tough.

16:42.769 --> 16:44.602
   - Yeah, that's real funny.
          Real funny.

16:44.604 --> 16:47.705
Now get your hands out of there
     and put in your feet.

16:47.707 --> 16:49.507
 - That seems a little tougher.

16:52.044 --> 16:52.276
               .

16:52.278 --> 16:54.278
        - It is painful!
       It's very painful!

16:54.280 --> 16:55.780
       - Good! Excellent.

16:55.782 --> 16:58.750
Now, why don't we hold this pose
        for a count of--

16:58.752 --> 17:00.651
       Oh, I don't know--
           two weeks?

17:00.653 --> 17:02.620
 Which is how long it took you
        to text me back

17:02.622 --> 17:04.055
 After the first time we slept
        with each other.

17:04.057 --> 17:05.690
        - In my defense,
       texting was just--

17:05.692 --> 17:08.526
     It was in its infancy,
       infancy back then.

17:08.528 --> 17:10.560
         Uncle! Uncle!
         Too much pain!

17:10.563 --> 17:12.663
      - Well, now we know
    you can feel something.

17:12.665 --> 17:15.133
      - Okay, I probably--
    I probably deserve that.

17:15.135 --> 17:17.635
          - Sure did.
       - I swear to you,

17:17.637 --> 17:21.204
 I didn't come here to get you
      to drop the lawsuit.

17:21.207 --> 17:23.741
       I came to tell you
        that I'm sorry.

17:23.742 --> 17:26.243
I--really, I'm sorry for the way
         I treated you.

17:26.246 --> 17:29.514
         I probably was
       kind of a bad guy.

17:29.516 --> 17:32.183
 - Uh, no, you were definitely
           a bad guy.

17:32.185 --> 17:34.619
            - Look.

17:34.621 --> 17:36.788
  I was--I was a selfish jerk
           back then,

17:36.790 --> 17:38.689
    And I surrounded myself
   with other selfish jerks,

17:38.691 --> 17:41.426
And basically just spent my life
     jerking people around.

17:41.428 --> 17:42.693
           - Mm-hmm.
        - But I really--

17:42.695 --> 17:44.162
     I've got better people
      in my life right now

17:44.164 --> 17:46.164
Who are helping me see the world

17:46.166 --> 17:48.299
     And see that there are
      other people in it.

17:48.301 --> 17:51.836
And I know that this is gonna be
    hard for you to believe,

17:51.838 --> 17:55.606
 But I am not that guy anymore.

17:55.608 --> 17:58.609
         And so, I'm...

17:58.611 --> 17:59.844
        I'm just sorry.

17:59.846 --> 18:02.513
       That's--that's all
     I really have to say.

18:02.515 --> 18:04.682
   I'll get out of your way.

18:04.684 --> 18:07.118
            - Wait.

18:07.120 --> 18:09.787
         Are you really
     not that guy anymore?

18:09.789 --> 18:12.490
        - I pinky swear.

18:15.194 --> 18:16.794
  - But you're still that guy

18:16.796 --> 18:20.498
         In the one way
   that really counts, right?

18:20.500 --> 18:23.868
        - Oh, hell yeah.

18:25.571 --> 18:29.273
    [footsteps approaching]

18:32.177 --> 18:33.744
       [footsteps resume]

18:33.746 --> 18:35.813
       [metal clattering]

18:38.817 --> 18:40.685
       [footsteps resume]

18:40.687 --> 18:43.888
 [rapid footsteps approaching]

18:56.735 --> 18:58.736
             - Boo.
             - Ah!

18:58.738 --> 19:02.440
   - How does it feel getting
  followed around everywhere?

19:02.442 --> 19:03.574
          - Not great.

19:03.576 --> 19:06.711
        - That's right.

19:06.713 --> 19:08.446
     You know what, pasty?

19:08.448 --> 19:11.382
I actually wouldn't mind hanging
  out with you once in a while

19:11.384 --> 19:15.520
        If you could...
  Just be a little bit cooler.

19:15.522 --> 19:16.921
  - I could totally be cooler.

19:16.923 --> 19:18.523
          - You sure?

19:18.525 --> 19:20.758
          - Well, no,
    but I mean, if I like--

19:20.760 --> 19:23.194
   If I formulate a strategy,

19:23.196 --> 19:25.463
  Put together a focus group,
        I can get there.

19:28.267 --> 19:30.468
      - You are one weird,
          little dude.

19:33.772 --> 19:37.875
    - So, do you wanna join
        my focus group?

19:39.711 --> 19:42.747
    [door opens and closes]

19:42.749 --> 19:45.850
 Well, I'm not hearing a "no."

19:45.852 --> 19:47.318
  - Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Look! Look!
          Look there!

19:47.320 --> 19:50.688
    She's crowning with one
    giant moment of ecstasy!

19:50.690 --> 19:54.592
     - Oh, look, it's a...
        Very gifted boy.

19:54.594 --> 19:55.793
     [baby cries on video]

19:55.795 --> 19:57.828
  - That's the umbilical cord,
             andy.

19:57.830 --> 19:59.664
           - [groans]

19:59.666 --> 20:01.365
         Oh, hey, guys.
             - Hey.

20:01.367 --> 20:02.667
           - Listen,
   I just wanted you to know

20:02.669 --> 20:04.769
That I really thought about what
        you said, fiona,

20:04.771 --> 20:07.838
      And took your advice
   and apologized to stacey.

20:07.840 --> 20:11.609
     Don't take her advice.
      She's not a lawyer!

20:11.611 --> 20:12.843
           [whispers]
    she's not even a doula.

20:12.845 --> 20:15.780
  - Do you know I am so proud
         of you, will?

20:15.782 --> 20:20.518
  I feel like I planted a seed
         inside of you,

20:20.520 --> 20:23.421
And now I'm watching it blossom
      into a colossal tree

20:23.423 --> 20:29.694
  - Yeah, I apologized to her,
 um, several times last night,

20:29.696 --> 20:33.764
         And after this
    restorative beverage...

20:33.766 --> 20:35.600
     I'm gonna go upstairs
      and apologize to her

20:35.602 --> 20:36.601
      A couple more times.

20:36.603 --> 20:37.935
  - That's my guy right there.

20:37.937 --> 20:41.405
      - What a puny shrub
       of disappointment

20:41.407 --> 20:43.307
     You turned out to be.

20:43.309 --> 20:44.709
    - Hey, you have your way
      of solving problems,

20:44.711 --> 20:45.776
          I have mine.

20:45.778 --> 20:47.845
     Mine's a bit more fun.

20:47.847 --> 20:51.249
Um, but listen, to celebrate her
     dropping the lawsuit,

20:51.251 --> 20:54.652
 I was wondering, should I buy
    a boat or a motorcycle?

20:54.654 --> 20:56.787
     - I vote for the boat.
   - That's one for the boat.

20:56.789 --> 20:58.623
     - I'm calling a lawyer
 and having a restraining order

20:58.625 --> 21:01.892
 - Can you just stop obsessing
        about my penis?

21:01.894 --> 21:03.294
     - What does that mean?
       - I can't believe

21:03.296 --> 21:05.863
   What you're doing to this
        wounded, naive,

21:05.865 --> 21:07.665
     Innocent young woman.

21:07.667 --> 21:09.433
     - Okay, we'll go boat.
          - Bye, will.

21:09.435 --> 21:11.836
    Thanks for all the sex.
           Super fun.

21:11.838 --> 21:14.305
- It was my pleasure, and yours.
           - Mm-hmm.

21:14.307 --> 21:16.540
      Oh, and by the way,
     this changes nothing.

21:16.542 --> 21:19.277
  I'm totally still suing you.

21:19.279 --> 21:20.978
           Hi, fiona!
             - Hi!

21:20.980 --> 21:23.447
- How does that affect the boat?

21:23.449 --> 21:25.449
          [dog barks]
