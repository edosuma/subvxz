EVERYBODY HATES CHRIS #028
"...the Buddy System"
CLOSED CAPTIONED

00:03.504 --> 00:04.372
CHRIS ROCK:
As class president,

00:04.405 --> 00:06.607
I thought things
would change for me,

00:06.640 --> 00:08.709
but I couldn't
have been more wrong.

00:10.211 --> 00:13.081
When you two are done,
see me in my office.

00:13.114 --> 00:14.415
Who are you?

00:14.448 --> 00:16.417
Mr. Edwards.
New principal.

00:23.557 --> 00:27.561
You were fighting.

00:27.595 --> 00:29.263
Why?

00:29.297 --> 00:30.531
'Cause he hates
black people,

00:30.564 --> 00:32.366
and I'm a
black person.

00:32.400 --> 00:34.435
That's a lie.
I love Michael Jordan.

00:34.468 --> 00:36.370
I think Gary Coleman
is hysterical.

00:36.404 --> 00:38.506
And don't even get me
started about Billy Ocean.

00:38.539 --> 00:41.142
"Caribbean Queen."

00:41.175 --> 00:44.078
That's a very good song.

00:44.112 --> 00:45.846
See?

00:45.879 --> 00:47.448
Just because you
watch Soul Train

00:47.481 --> 00:49.283
don't make you
Don Cornelius.

00:49.317 --> 00:51.119
Mr. Edwards,
he has been picking on me

00:51.152 --> 00:52.520
since the first day
I came to this school.

00:52.553 --> 00:53.821
Is that true?

00:53.854 --> 00:56.190
Yeah.

00:56.224 --> 00:57.658
All right, Caruso, you can go.

00:59.427 --> 01:01.095
What?

01:01.129 --> 01:02.496
What?

01:02.530 --> 01:04.332
Before coming to Corleone,

01:04.365 --> 01:05.833
Principal Edwards
was on a self-imposed,

01:05.866 --> 01:07.501
three-year vow of silence.

01:07.535 --> 01:11.505
Keep your filthy hands
off of my school lunch program!

01:11.539 --> 01:12.740
You get the hell out...!

01:12.773 --> 01:14.208
Which he allegedly began

01:14.242 --> 01:16.177
two minutes after
cursing like a madman

01:16.210 --> 01:18.479
and knocking out the teeth
of his former boss.

01:18.512 --> 01:21.549
Have you ever
considered the possibility

01:21.582 --> 01:23.617
this is your fault?

01:23.651 --> 01:25.653
That's what they said
to Rodney King.

01:25.686 --> 01:26.854
My fault?

01:26.887 --> 01:29.723
He's threatened by you, Chris.

01:29.757 --> 01:33.694
Your very presence
makes him doubt

01:33.727 --> 01:36.364
his ability

01:36.397 --> 01:37.665
to succeed.

01:37.698 --> 01:40.334
He always succeeds
in punching me in the face.

01:44.272 --> 01:48.409
He's using you as
a manifestation of his angst.

01:48.442 --> 01:51.579
Subsequently, he's trying
to quell his anxiety

01:51.612 --> 01:52.780
by conquering you,

01:52.813 --> 01:56.317
thereby conquering his fear.

01:56.350 --> 01:58.519
By punching me in the face?

01:58.552 --> 01:59.720
Exactly.

01:59.753 --> 02:02.756
So you want me
to just let him do it?

02:02.790 --> 02:06.794
Have you thought about trying
to see things

02:06.827 --> 02:09.263
from his point
of view?

02:09.297 --> 02:11.165
So you want me to punch him
in the face?

02:11.199 --> 02:13.234
No.

02:13.267 --> 02:14.735
Have you ever

02:14.768 --> 02:18.339
seen the film
The Defiant Ones?

02:18.372 --> 02:20.474
The Defiant Ones? No.

02:20.508 --> 02:21.809
What's that?

02:24.978 --> 02:28.516
Two men are shackled together

02:28.549 --> 02:30.351
while trying
to escape from prison--

02:30.384 --> 02:35.256
one white, one black,
one educated, one...

02:35.289 --> 02:41.695
They learn they have to depend
on each other or perish.

02:41.729 --> 02:42.796
That's what I'm going
to do for you.

02:42.830 --> 02:46.334
You're going to chain us
together and put us in jail?

02:46.367 --> 02:48.902
Yeah! Figuratively.

02:48.936 --> 02:52.273
I'm taking some students
on a field trip tomorrow.

02:52.306 --> 02:53.874
You and Caruso are going
to come along.

02:53.907 --> 02:55.676
Have your mother sign this.

02:55.709 --> 02:57.811
To help you
and Caruso

02:57.845 --> 02:59.647
learn to depend on each other,

02:59.680 --> 03:02.616
I'm going to employ
the buddy system.

03:02.650 --> 03:03.617
The buddy system?

03:03.651 --> 03:09.723
Chris, you and Caruso
are going to be buddies.

03:09.757 --> 03:11.692
Just like the Crips
and the Bloods.

03:11.725 --> 03:15.696

NETWORK TELEVISION

03:19.800 --> 03:21.869
* Oh... make it funky now!

03:44.658 --> 03:47.861
While I was preparing to see
Caruso in a whole new way,

03:47.895 --> 03:49.763
Tonya was working
on a new look, too.

03:49.797 --> 03:51.765
Mom...

03:51.799 --> 03:52.900
can I borrow
your clip-on

03:52.933 --> 03:54.902
hoop earrings?
No.

03:54.935 --> 03:55.969
But all my friends
are wearing

03:56.003 --> 03:57.571
pink shirts
and hoop earrings.

03:57.605 --> 03:59.307
I'm not your
friends' mother.

03:59.340 --> 04:01.375
I don't know, Mom.
Earrings may draw away

04:01.409 --> 04:02.676
attention from her
big, old head.

04:02.710 --> 04:03.811
You got a big head.

04:03.844 --> 04:04.612
You're head-mo-knotty,

04:04.645 --> 04:05.513
got more head than
you got body.

04:05.546 --> 04:07.815
Your head so big, your
hat got two floors.

04:07.848 --> 04:11.018
Your head so big, you
got to put on your
shirts feet first.

04:11.051 --> 04:12.853
Your head so big,
it has a moon.

04:12.886 --> 04:14.788
Eh, hey-- all right.

04:14.822 --> 04:16.056
Enough now.

04:16.089 --> 04:17.958
Tonya, why don't you
wear your flower earrings?

04:17.991 --> 04:19.960
You're too young
for hoops, that's
women's jewelry.

04:19.993 --> 04:21.429
And I'm not going
to have people

04:21.462 --> 04:22.663
looking at my
daughter like that.

04:22.696 --> 04:24.498
Like what?
Like this.

04:29.470 --> 04:30.771
You see the earrings
on that girl?

04:31.872 --> 04:33.841
Everybody else has them.

04:33.874 --> 04:35.909
Well, if everybody else
got a butt whooping,

04:35.943 --> 04:37.345
would you want one, too?

04:37.378 --> 04:38.979
JULIUS:
Hey.

04:39.012 --> 04:41.449
Where's Chris?
ROCHELLE:
He left early.

04:41.482 --> 04:43.884
He had to go on
a field trip.
Hey, Dad.

04:43.917 --> 04:45.686
Check it out.
I got a hundred

04:45.719 --> 04:47.321
on my spelling test.
All right.

04:47.355 --> 04:48.489
My man!

04:48.522 --> 04:49.790
I was thinking...

04:49.823 --> 04:52.493
Could I get a hockey
jersey since I got

04:52.526 --> 04:53.961
a hundred on my test?
You're supposed to get

04:53.994 --> 04:56.096
a hundred, you don't get
a prize for doing well.

04:56.129 --> 04:58.065
My father never
rewarded good behavior.

04:58.098 --> 04:59.733
Dad, I cleaned out the tub.

04:59.767 --> 05:02.069
You're supposed to clean
the tub, it's your dirt ring.

05:02.102 --> 05:04.638
Hey, Dad. I fixed the heater.

05:04.672 --> 05:05.873
You're supposed
to fix the heater.

05:05.906 --> 05:07.641
You're the one
who likes it warm.

05:07.675 --> 05:09.977
Hey, Dad, I slaughtered a pig.

05:11.679 --> 05:13.013
You're supposed
to slaughter a pig.

05:13.046 --> 05:14.815
You're the one that likes bacon.

05:14.848 --> 05:16.784
Julius, it's just
a hockey jersey.

05:16.817 --> 05:18.519
Mom, it's not just
a hockey jersey.

05:18.552 --> 05:20.421
It's Wayne Gretzky.

05:20.454 --> 05:22.856
He's the best player
in the league.

05:22.890 --> 05:24.658
Gretzky, huh?

05:24.692 --> 05:25.826
I'll think about it.

05:26.860 --> 05:28.962
Okay, time to go to school.

05:34.602 --> 05:36.136
ROCHELLE:
Tonya?

05:36.169 --> 05:38.372
Coming.

05:40.007 --> 05:41.642
Geez, Caruso?

05:41.675 --> 05:42.976
Why didn't he just
kick you into traffic?

05:43.010 --> 05:44.478
I don't know.

05:44.512 --> 05:46.146
But I'm going to give it a shot.

05:46.179 --> 05:47.815
I mean, it can't get any worse.

05:47.848 --> 05:49.783
That's what people said
while they were

05:49.817 --> 05:51.519
boarding the Amistad.
So who's your buddy?

05:52.553 --> 05:53.987
Hey, Greg, you ready?

05:54.021 --> 05:56.390
Sure am.
I'll be right there.

05:57.425 --> 05:58.692
You got a girl?

05:58.726 --> 06:00.994
Not just a girl, but a
girl who's interested

06:01.028 --> 06:02.830
in the evolution
of species.

06:02.863 --> 06:04.031
I am so in there.

06:08.035 --> 06:09.470
Come on, Bubbles.

06:10.904 --> 06:12.573
Right now, I'd feel safer
at the Neverland Ranch.

06:13.741 --> 06:14.842
* Risky. *
Hey, Julius.

06:14.875 --> 06:15.909
You want some
tap shoes?

06:15.943 --> 06:16.944
Tap shoes?

06:16.977 --> 06:18.612
Yeah. I got men's.

06:18.646 --> 06:22.015
I got women's and
children's, huh?

06:22.049 --> 06:24.952
You get your whole
family some tap shoes.

06:24.985 --> 06:27.655
My father always thought
if you wore tap shoes,

06:27.688 --> 06:28.756
you had to tap dance.

06:28.789 --> 06:30.958
We're friends of
the deceased.
Oh, right this way.

06:37.698 --> 06:39.967
You can't make
no money tap dancing.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.470
What I really need
is a hockey jersey for Drew.

06:42.503 --> 06:43.336
Wayne Gretzky.

06:43.370 --> 06:46.740
Hockey? What kind
of kids you raising?

06:46.774 --> 06:47.875
Do you have one
or not?

06:47.908 --> 06:49.910
All right, all right.

06:49.943 --> 06:51.479
Hockey, uh...

06:51.512 --> 06:53.614
I'm sorry, I-I don't
have anything,

06:53.647 --> 06:55.616
but if I find something,
I'll let you know.

06:55.649 --> 06:56.884
All right, brother.

06:56.917 --> 06:58.952
All right. Okay.
Take care.

06:59.987 --> 07:02.456
Hockey? Them kids in trouble.

07:02.490 --> 07:04.592
My father was dealing
with the bad news

07:04.625 --> 07:06.694
while my mother
was getting great news.

07:06.727 --> 07:07.995
What?

07:08.028 --> 07:09.897
The guy I'm seeing
has kidney stones!

07:09.930 --> 07:12.032
Vanessa, that's good news?

07:12.065 --> 07:14.234
We got tickets
to see Patti LaBelle.
Uh-huh.

07:14.267 --> 07:16.236
And he can't go!

07:16.269 --> 07:17.738
Listening to Patti LaBelle

07:17.771 --> 07:19.973
could make my mother feel good,
no matter what.

07:21.041 --> 07:22.910
Come on, pepito.

07:22.943 --> 07:25.879
I told you, man,
I didn't do it.

07:25.913 --> 07:29.182
¿Cual es tu último voluntad?

07:29.216 --> 07:30.951
Can you play "New Attitude"?

07:30.984 --> 07:32.920
Yes! Wait a minute,
wait a minute, wait.

07:32.953 --> 07:34.655
I gotta figure out
what I'm gonna wear.

07:34.688 --> 07:36.023
Me, too. Oh, girl,
I'll see you later.

07:36.056 --> 07:37.157
Wh-wh-wh...
Ooh.

07:37.190 --> 07:39.026
Wear that blue dress.
I like you in the blue dress.

07:39.059 --> 07:40.628
Yeah, girl.

07:40.661 --> 07:42.763
Patti. Patti. Patti.

07:42.796 --> 07:45.966
* I'm in control,
my worries are few *

07:45.999 --> 07:49.069
* Know where I'm going,
and I know what to do *

07:49.102 --> 07:50.971
* Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

07:51.004 --> 07:52.172
* I've got a...

07:52.205 --> 07:55.008
Oww. * New attitude.

07:55.042 --> 07:58.979
EDWARDS:
All right, class, listen up.

07:59.012 --> 08:01.882
I reiterate: we are
on the buddy system today.

08:01.915 --> 08:06.186
So, you are responsible
for your buddy.

08:06.219 --> 08:09.723
No matter what happens,
stay together.

08:09.757 --> 08:11.224
We have about two hours,

08:11.258 --> 08:13.561
so you have plenty of time
to see all the exhibits.

08:14.595 --> 08:15.829
Is he kidding?

08:15.863 --> 08:18.065
You can come here
every weekend for years

08:18.098 --> 08:19.900
and still barely
scratch the surface.

08:19.933 --> 08:22.002
After 20 years,
Greg still hasn't

08:22.035 --> 08:23.971
made it out
of the bone exhibit.

08:25.172 --> 08:26.006
Now remember...

08:27.274 --> 08:29.309
...the only way you're
going to get along

08:29.342 --> 08:32.212
with Caruso is if
you understand

08:32.245 --> 08:34.682
why he hates you.

08:34.715 --> 08:35.883
He needs your help.

08:35.916 --> 08:37.751
But if I'm helping him,
who's gonna help me?

08:39.787 --> 08:41.955
You're helping yourself.

08:43.023 --> 08:45.092
Spoken like a true white man.

08:46.293 --> 08:47.327
CHRIS:
Come on, man,
we've gotta go

08:47.360 --> 08:48.762
before the bus
leaves us.

08:48.796 --> 08:50.097
Listen, Bohannon, relax.

08:50.130 --> 08:51.999
The bus isn't going
to leave without us.

08:52.032 --> 08:54.101
The whole class
is waiting on us.

08:54.134 --> 08:55.869
I thought you people
were used to being late.

08:55.903 --> 08:57.738
Come on, man,
we've got to go.

08:57.771 --> 09:00.708
All you've been doing
since we got here is
complaining.

09:00.741 --> 09:03.143
Well, I haven't
really seen anything.

09:03.176 --> 09:04.812
All I've seen
is you eating

09:04.845 --> 09:06.246
in the cafeteria
for over an hour.

09:06.279 --> 09:07.848
All right, you know what?

09:07.881 --> 09:09.650
I'm sorry. I'll just
be another minute.

09:09.683 --> 09:12.085
Really?
Maybe Principal Edwards
was right.

09:12.119 --> 09:14.054
Caruso might make a change.

09:14.087 --> 09:15.923
Yeah, just do me
a favor, hold this.

09:18.058 --> 09:20.293
Now, go wait
by the door.
Okay.

09:20.327 --> 09:22.896
WOMAN :
Tim, do you need
cashier help or security?

09:24.865 --> 09:27.668
The buddy system
was failing miserably,

09:27.701 --> 09:30.337
but the black decoy
system was working great.

09:30.370 --> 09:33.040
(woman on radio talks
indistinctly)

09:38.411 --> 09:40.781
Usually Greg would've
noticed if I was gone,

09:40.814 --> 09:42.382
but if you put a girl
in front of him,

09:42.415 --> 09:44.051
he didn't see anything else.

09:44.084 --> 09:46.319
Hurry up, I want
to get on this bus.

09:46.353 --> 09:48.355
Don't worry, I'm sure
they saved you a
spot in the back.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.591
Which one's ours?

09:57.898 --> 09:58.999
I think it's that one.

10:01.869 --> 10:04.805
I think I should've been
buddies with the bus driver.

10:08.876 --> 10:10.744
CARUSO:
How come you didn't tell me
the bus was leaving?

10:10.778 --> 10:13.647
When I said "Let's hurry up
before the bus leaves us,"

10:13.681 --> 10:15.783
what bus did you think
I was talking about?

10:15.816 --> 10:19.152
Sorry, I couldn't understand
all your crazy jive talk.

10:19.186 --> 10:22.055
Okay, we can catch
the next train,

10:22.089 --> 10:23.657
and we'll be back in no time.

10:23.691 --> 10:25.759
I spent all my
money on food.

10:25.793 --> 10:27.861
Okay, fine, I think
I have enough money

10:27.895 --> 10:29.863
to get two tokens.
So let's go.

10:29.897 --> 10:31.098
Who put you in charge?

10:31.131 --> 10:33.033
I'm just trying to get
us back to school.

10:33.066 --> 10:34.267
Just let me make
the decisions.

10:34.301 --> 10:35.502
Why should I do that?

10:35.535 --> 10:39.006
How many times do
I have to punch you
before you get a clue?

10:39.039 --> 10:40.173
Don't you watch the movies?

10:40.207 --> 10:42.676
Gene Wilder made all the
decisions in Silver Streak.

10:42.710 --> 10:44.111
Richard Pryor
just followed orders.

10:44.144 --> 10:46.847
So... what do
you want to do?

10:46.880 --> 10:49.216
Let's take the next train.

10:49.249 --> 10:51.284
To get back to Brooklyn,

10:51.318 --> 10:54.955
it felt like we went around
the entire city.

10:54.988 --> 10:58.291
We went through Chinatown...

10:58.325 --> 11:01.829
The meatpacking district...

11:01.862 --> 11:04.031
We even went through
theatre district.

11:04.064 --> 11:05.899
The only place
we didn't go through

11:05.933 --> 11:06.967
was our school district.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.903
While me and Caruso were lost,

11:09.937 --> 11:12.740
Tonya was trying
not to get found out.

11:25.518 --> 11:26.887
Where are you going?

11:26.920 --> 11:29.256
I'm going to see
Patti LaBelle.

11:31.158 --> 11:32.860
How do I look?

11:32.893 --> 11:35.095
You look like one of those
ladies from those old movies.

11:35.128 --> 11:36.329
Who asked you?

11:36.363 --> 11:37.998
Well, I think
you look better

11:38.031 --> 11:40.267
in the brown skirt,
the beige stripped shirt.

11:40.300 --> 11:41.068
Brush your hair back

11:41.101 --> 11:42.936
and put on
your gold hoop earrings.

11:42.970 --> 11:44.371
He's good.

11:44.404 --> 11:46.339
Oh, and can I get some
potato chips before dinner?

11:46.373 --> 11:47.274
Yeah, yeah, yeah, go ahead.

12:04.992 --> 12:07.027
Tonya knew she was
going to be caught.

12:07.060 --> 12:08.996
Just didn't know when.

12:09.029 --> 12:10.363
Did you take my earrings?

12:10.397 --> 12:11.999
What earrings?

12:12.032 --> 12:14.367
Okay, here's how this
works, Tonya.

12:14.401 --> 12:17.470
You can keep lying, or you can
tell me you took my earrings.

12:17.504 --> 12:19.206
You decide.

12:19.239 --> 12:21.208
You promise you won't yell?

12:21.241 --> 12:23.276
I won't yell.

12:23.310 --> 12:24.812
I took you earrings...

12:24.845 --> 12:26.780
and I lost one.

12:26.814 --> 12:31.251
:
Didn't I tell you not
to touch my earrings?!

12:31.284 --> 12:32.519
You promised you wouldn't yell.

12:32.552 --> 12:34.154
I've been falling for that one
for years.

12:34.187 --> 12:37.791
Do you know how valuable
those earrings were, Tonya?!

12:37.825 --> 12:39.292
Huh?!

12:39.326 --> 12:41.361
Whenever my mother was ready
to kill one of us,

12:41.394 --> 12:43.964
she'd always count down
from five.

12:43.997 --> 12:45.132
Five...

12:45.165 --> 12:46.967
* Huh!

12:47.000 --> 12:48.035
...four...

12:49.269 --> 12:50.403
...three...

12:51.338 --> 12:52.339
...two...

12:52.372 --> 12:54.374
* Uh!

12:54.407 --> 12:56.143
...one.

12:56.176 --> 12:57.410
That's it.

12:57.444 --> 13:01.414
I'm going to let your
father handle this.

13:04.117 --> 13:05.986
After taking a tour
of the city,

13:06.019 --> 13:08.155
I decided it was time
to take charge.

13:08.188 --> 13:09.322
Where are
you going?

13:09.356 --> 13:11.158
I'm going
to call my mother.

13:11.191 --> 13:13.426
I'm making the decisions
around here.
Not for me.

13:13.460 --> 13:14.995
You can do whatever you feel

13:15.028 --> 13:16.329
like doing,
but I'm calling my mother.

13:16.363 --> 13:17.564
Well, give me a quarter,
too. I'll call my mom.

13:17.597 --> 13:20.067
No. I only have
one quarter.

13:20.100 --> 13:21.268
Ah, don't
worry about it.

13:21.301 --> 13:23.470
I'll have my mother
call your mother.

13:28.441 --> 13:31.311
Mom. Yeah,
it's Joey.

13:31.344 --> 13:34.281
All right, if the
school calls and
says I'm lost,

13:34.314 --> 13:35.415
I'm not.

13:35.448 --> 13:36.884
Nah, I'm okay.

13:36.917 --> 13:38.418
I'm with Chris.

13:38.451 --> 13:39.419
Yeah, the black one.

13:39.452 --> 13:41.321
Strange realizing

13:41.354 --> 13:43.423
that Caruso had a loving family
at home.

13:43.456 --> 13:45.425
A loving racist family.

13:45.458 --> 13:46.459
All right.
Love you. Bye.

13:46.493 --> 13:49.562
Hey, you were supposed
to tell her to call my mom.

13:49.596 --> 13:50.931
Forgot. Sorry.

13:50.964 --> 13:52.165
Why don't you call collect?

13:52.199 --> 13:53.867
That's what the guys
in prison do.

13:53.901 --> 13:56.236
Move!

14:02.509 --> 14:03.911
Hello?

14:03.944 --> 14:06.379
WOMAN:
I have a collect call from...

14:06.413 --> 14:08.848
Ooh! Ooh.

14:12.252 --> 14:14.354
My dad couldn't always
give us what we wanted,

14:14.387 --> 14:16.389
but he would always
do his best.

14:16.423 --> 14:19.426
Hey, Dad.
I'm really proud of you for
getting 100 on that test,

14:19.459 --> 14:22.963
so here you go.

14:22.996 --> 14:24.397
Yeah!

14:24.431 --> 14:26.233
Wow.

14:26.266 --> 14:28.401
Huh

14:28.435 --> 14:30.570
Drew thought
about saying this...

14:30.603 --> 14:32.105
Gritsky?

14:32.139 --> 14:33.406
It's not Gritsky.

14:33.440 --> 14:35.508
It's Gretzky with an "E"!

14:35.542 --> 14:37.210
I scored 100
on my spelling test.

14:37.244 --> 14:38.245
I can't wear this!

14:38.278 --> 14:40.680
You got that big old head,
and you can't even spell

14:40.713 --> 14:42.182
Gretzky.

14:42.215 --> 14:44.117
Maybe you should take
my spelling classes.

14:44.151 --> 14:45.185
I ain't wearing this.

14:45.218 --> 14:47.554
But if he did,
here's what would've happened.

14:47.587 --> 14:48.388
What's the story?

14:48.421 --> 14:49.622
Apparently,
the kid loves hockey.

14:49.656 --> 14:52.659
Father brings home a jersey
that says Gritsky with an "I"

14:52.692 --> 14:54.394
instead of Gretzky with an "E."

14:54.427 --> 14:55.695
Son mouths off,
dad loses it,

14:55.728 --> 14:57.430
shoves the jersey
down the kid's throat.

14:57.464 --> 14:58.598
Is that the jersey?

14:58.631 --> 14:59.432
It's all we
could find.

14:59.466 --> 15:01.501
Good thing he didn't
ask for skates.

15:01.534 --> 15:03.136
So?

15:03.170 --> 15:04.304
It's cool.

15:04.337 --> 15:05.305
Thanks, Dad.
Oh.

15:05.338 --> 15:08.175
The next year,
Drew got a Yankees jersey

15:08.208 --> 15:10.010
that said Mezzie Mackson.

15:10.043 --> 15:13.080
You better talk
to your daughter
before I kill her.

15:13.113 --> 15:14.314
Why

15:14.347 --> 15:16.416
Go ask her.

15:16.449 --> 15:19.686
All that could save Tonya
was a sad look.

15:24.524 --> 15:26.559
What's going on?

15:28.095 --> 15:29.496
Mom's really mad at me.

15:30.663 --> 15:32.365
Tell me what happened.

15:32.399 --> 15:35.502
I just wanted to wear
earrings like my friends,

15:35.535 --> 15:37.537
so I took Mom's
gold hoops,

15:37.570 --> 15:39.172
and I lost one.

15:39.206 --> 15:40.373
Oh, Tonya.

15:40.407 --> 15:43.376
Do you think maybe I could
save up and buy another pair?

15:43.410 --> 15:45.445
It's not about the money, Tonya.

15:45.478 --> 15:47.580
I gave your mother
those earrings.

15:47.614 --> 15:50.250
You can't replace them.

15:50.283 --> 15:52.685
What are you going to do?

15:52.719 --> 15:54.287
My father could've
spanked Tonya,

15:54.321 --> 15:56.223
or grounded her
until she was grown,

15:56.256 --> 15:57.457
but he said something

15:57.490 --> 15:59.759
that made her feel worse
than all of that.

15:59.792 --> 16:01.394
I'm really disappointed
in you.

16:03.463 --> 16:06.466
Father, I have brought
disgrace to myself

16:06.499 --> 16:08.668
and to our family.

16:08.701 --> 16:10.437
Tonya, no!

16:10.470 --> 16:11.571
Leave me now, Father.

16:11.604 --> 16:12.672
I must whup myself

16:12.705 --> 16:16.009
until you can find it
in your heart to forgive me.

16:19.279 --> 16:21.581
I'm sorry.

16:21.614 --> 16:23.150
Did you tell your mother that?

16:23.183 --> 16:24.484
Will you come with me?

16:24.517 --> 16:26.419
Did I take the earrings?

16:33.493 --> 16:35.495
Good luck.

16:37.730 --> 16:40.433
Are you sure
we're on the right train?

16:40.467 --> 16:42.102
You're in charge.
You tell me.

16:42.135 --> 16:44.471
Look, nobody told you to wait
for me in the first place.

16:44.504 --> 16:46.273
We're on the buddy
system, which means

16:46.306 --> 16:48.341
I'm supposed
to stay with you
no matter what.

16:48.375 --> 16:49.742
You think I
want to be here?

16:49.776 --> 16:52.179
Shoot, if I had done
what I wanted to do,

16:52.212 --> 16:53.513
you'd be sitting
here by yourself.

16:53.546 --> 16:54.614
Well, go then.

16:54.647 --> 16:56.716
Fine.

16:56.749 --> 16:59.052
(indistinct male voice
over intercom)

17:06.126 --> 17:08.228
So long, Caruso.

17:08.261 --> 17:10.597
Enjoy talking civil rights
with your new friends.

17:13.666 --> 17:16.303
Even though Caruso had gotten
on my last nerve,

17:16.336 --> 17:18.571
I was afraid
I might be his last chance.

17:18.605 --> 17:21.708
(indistinct male voice
over intercom)

17:21.741 --> 17:25.245
So, you take that
to Brooklyn Beach stop,

17:25.278 --> 17:27.347
and you're right there,
all right?

17:27.380 --> 17:28.648
Hey.

17:28.681 --> 17:30.550
How'd you get
here before me?

17:30.583 --> 17:31.818
I took the express train.

17:31.851 --> 17:33.320
This is the local train.

17:33.353 --> 17:34.287
Hey, man,

17:34.321 --> 17:36.456
why'd you leave your
boy out here like that?

17:36.489 --> 17:37.624
We could've hurt him.

17:37.657 --> 17:38.725
I came back to get him.

17:38.758 --> 17:40.393
What you want
me to do?

17:40.427 --> 17:41.561
Nah.

17:41.594 --> 17:42.529
Leave him alone.

17:42.562 --> 17:45.298
If he gets hurt,
I think it effects my grade.

17:45.332 --> 17:48.468
Hey, man, in the
buddy system,

17:48.501 --> 17:50.470
you never leave
your buddy.

17:50.503 --> 17:51.538
No matter what.

17:51.571 --> 17:53.340
You understand?

17:53.373 --> 17:55.308
Yeah.
Good.

17:55.342 --> 17:56.543
Now give me your wallet.

17:56.576 --> 17:58.111
I don't have any money in it.

17:58.145 --> 17:59.812
Did I ask you
all of that?

17:59.846 --> 18:02.615
I guess this is what
Martin Luther King fought for--

18:02.649 --> 18:05.885
black and white bullies side
by side ready to kick my ass.

18:05.918 --> 18:09.088
Hey... hold
on to that.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.026
What now?

18:14.060 --> 18:16.763
Well, we switch platforms
and then head back downtown.

18:16.796 --> 18:19.199
All right, let's go.
Oh, wait.

18:19.232 --> 18:20.600
So you really
came back for me?

18:20.633 --> 18:21.601
Yeah. Why?

18:21.634 --> 18:23.436
Because I would
have left you.

18:23.470 --> 18:25.238
For real?
Yeah, man.
You're dumb.

18:25.272 --> 18:26.739
Those guys could
have killed you.

18:26.773 --> 18:28.741
All right. All right,
you done?

18:28.775 --> 18:29.909
Yeah.

18:29.942 --> 18:32.879
Let's go home, Muddy.

18:32.912 --> 18:35.648
Look, I don't know what
you have against me.

18:35.682 --> 18:37.584
Hey, I don't
even know you.

18:37.617 --> 18:39.586
So, I was wondering maybe...

18:39.619 --> 18:41.521
You know, maybe
we can be cool.

18:41.554 --> 18:43.423
You don't even
have to like me.

18:43.456 --> 18:45.292
Yeah, I know what you mean.

18:45.325 --> 18:46.726
Tell you what.
What?

18:46.759 --> 18:49.462
If you can run faster
than I can throw,

18:49.496 --> 18:51.731
I won't hit you
with this battery.

18:56.936 --> 18:59.339
* Why can't we be friends?

18:59.372 --> 19:00.807
* Why can't we be friends?

19:00.840 --> 19:02.509
Hey, man, where
have you been?

19:02.542 --> 19:04.177
We missed the bus.

19:04.211 --> 19:05.478
Was anyone looking for us?

19:05.512 --> 19:06.446
No.

19:06.479 --> 19:08.481
So, how are things going
with you and Jennifer?

19:08.515 --> 19:11.218
It was going great until
we got into a debate

19:11.251 --> 19:13.686
about whether humans or climatic
change caused the demise

19:13.720 --> 19:15.222
of the Pleistocene megafauna.

19:15.255 --> 19:16.389
Idiot!

19:16.423 --> 19:18.791
* I really 'membered you,
when you drink my wine... *

19:18.825 --> 19:19.959
It didn't
end well.

19:19.992 --> 19:21.461
Same as Bobby and Whitney.

19:21.494 --> 19:23.196
* Why can't we be friends?

19:23.230 --> 19:24.431
So how did it go?

19:24.464 --> 19:26.499
Huh?

19:26.533 --> 19:27.634
Oh, the buddy system?

19:27.667 --> 19:29.469
Oh, it was all right.

19:29.502 --> 19:30.737
Really?

19:30.770 --> 19:32.572
Even after I left
you at the museum.

19:32.605 --> 19:34.641
* I seen you walkin' down
in Chinatown... *
Wait.

19:34.674 --> 19:36.609
You left me and Caruso
alone on purpose?

19:36.643 --> 19:39.279
* I called you but
you could not look around... *

19:39.312 --> 19:40.813
You can't do that.
I mean, we're kids.

19:40.847 --> 19:42.215
Anything could've happened.

19:42.249 --> 19:44.751
I had my eyes on
you the whole time.

19:44.784 --> 19:45.752
What?

19:45.785 --> 19:46.886
That's right.

19:46.919 --> 19:49.789
From Chinatown through the
Bronx down through Harlem.

19:49.822 --> 19:51.424
Oh. Here's your wallet.

19:51.458 --> 19:53.960
* I bring my money
to the welfare line... *

19:53.993 --> 19:56.563
Okay, I-I really
don't understand.

19:56.596 --> 19:57.730
What was the point?

19:57.764 --> 19:59.699
Caruso still hates me.

19:59.732 --> 20:00.867
What about you?

20:00.900 --> 20:02.469
Did you learn
anything today?

20:02.502 --> 20:07.340
Well, I learned that
Caruso didn't like me yesterday,

20:07.374 --> 20:08.875
he doesn't like me today,

20:08.908 --> 20:11.278
and he's not going
to like me tomorrow.

20:11.311 --> 20:12.712
Yes, all that's true.

20:12.745 --> 20:13.846
But you're forgetting

20:13.880 --> 20:16.449
you learned something else
today much more important.

20:16.483 --> 20:17.617
What?

20:17.650 --> 20:19.552
You learned that
I was wrong.

20:19.586 --> 20:21.788
* Everybody hates Chris.

20:21.821 --> 20:25.825
