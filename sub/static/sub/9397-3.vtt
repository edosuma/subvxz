00:02.520 --> 00:03.714
I'm your mother.

00:03.800 --> 00:07.713
- Is this woman my mother?
- Your mom is gone, Peyton.

00:07.800 --> 00:10.872
But your biological mother is alive.

00:11.880 --> 00:14.713
<i>I saw her buying drugs in the park today.</i>
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

00:15.040 --> 00:18.396
- You and Erica broke up?
- She got popular.

00:18.480 --> 00:19.515
I love you.

00:19.600 --> 00:21.875
I really don't know
when I'm gonna be ready for us again,

00:21.960 --> 00:24.030
or even if I'll be ready for us at all.

00:24.120 --> 00:27.510
We could totally have a summer-like fling,
just in the fall.

00:27.600 --> 00:29.955
And nonexclusive.

00:30.840 --> 00:33.115
I'm the guy for you, Brooke Davis.

00:33.320 --> 00:34.435
You'll see.

00:34.520 --> 00:37.080
<i>Three months ago,</i>

00:37.160 --> 00:40.197

00:40.280 --> 00:43.590

02:01.200 --> 02:02.838
Looks like we're gonna
have to go to Augusta

02:02.920 --> 02:04.592
to get in a decent nine holes, huh?

02:04.680 --> 02:08.309
I didn't think you were coming back,
so I took the course down.

02:08.400 --> 02:10.197
It didn't feel right letting it fall apart.

02:10.280 --> 02:13.238
I think you're just tired
of me schooling your sorry butt.

02:13.320 --> 02:14.912
I didn't think you'd remember.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.752
Are you kidding me?
Tomorrow's the first day of school.

02:16.840 --> 02:19.229
Every year we try and predict
what the next year is gonna hold,

02:19.320 --> 02:21.038
and every year I realize
how out of touch I was

02:21.120 --> 02:22.269
with the year before.

02:22.360 --> 02:26.148
Unless, of course, this says
that I'd be married and separated by now.

02:27.040 --> 02:29.235
- Zero hour.
- You first.

02:30.280 --> 02:32.748
"This year I'm going to kiss a boy."

02:32.840 --> 02:35.035
That's mine. It's from seventh grade!

02:35.120 --> 02:38.715
- Well, it finally happened for you, didn't it?
- Shut up. What about you?

02:38.800 --> 02:40.438
"This year I'll talk to Peyton Sawyer."

02:40.520 --> 02:41.873
It doesn't say that.

02:41.960 --> 02:43.473
Yes, it does. Look at it.

02:45.200 --> 02:47.794
"This year I'll volunteer
at the tutor center."

02:48.280 --> 02:50.874
"Mom and Keith will finally get married."

02:54.320 --> 02:56.515
"I'll date a musician."

02:58.520 --> 03:00.192
Why do we do this again?

03:00.280 --> 03:01.395
It's supposed to be fun.

03:01.480 --> 03:03.596
How about this year we just wait
and see how the first day goes

03:03.680 --> 03:05.238
before any predictions?

03:05.880 --> 03:07.711
It's good to have you back, Haley.

03:07.800 --> 03:10.314
Couldn't have done senior year
without you.

03:18.200 --> 03:20.077
Okay, I know in high school
you always feel like

03:20.160 --> 03:22.390
everyone's staring at you,
but this is ridiculous.

03:22.480 --> 03:26.029
No, they're not used to having
a celebrity in their midst.

03:26.120 --> 03:28.793
- They'll get over it.
- Let's just find our lockers.

03:28.880 --> 03:32.759
- I'm 141. What are you?
- 143. This year it must be alphabetical.

03:32.840 --> 03:34.273
Which means...

03:37.880 --> 03:39.996
You should've used your stage name.

03:46.280 --> 03:49.317
- I waited for you this morning.
- What do you mean?

03:49.960 --> 03:52.315
I just figured since
it's the first day of school,

03:52.400 --> 03:54.994
"the guy for me" would pick me up,

03:55.080 --> 03:56.672
bring me flowers, maybe a bagel.

03:56.760 --> 03:59.558
Just saying, not that impressive.

03:59.880 --> 04:02.075
I had a couple things to take care of.

04:05.160 --> 04:07.515
You totally pimped my locker.

04:09.080 --> 04:11.913
Yep. It's very exclusive.

04:19.360 --> 04:21.555
Hey, roommate,
you were out early this morning.

04:21.640 --> 04:24.234
You know, it's the first day.
You have to pace yourself.

04:24.320 --> 04:26.788
I'm usually one of those people
that likes the first day of school.

04:26.880 --> 04:28.552
You know, new pens, new notebook,
new backpack.

04:28.640 --> 04:30.949
- A nerd.
- Exactly.

04:31.680 --> 04:34.240
I found out that I'm behind
for the first time in my academic career,

04:34.320 --> 04:37.676
and I'm gonna have to work twice as hard
if I want to graduate by June, so...

04:37.760 --> 04:39.591
And everybody here is giving me
the zoo treatment,

04:39.680 --> 04:42.478
except for Nathan,
who, of course, won't barely look at me.

04:42.560 --> 04:43.549
Right.

04:43.640 --> 04:45.073
You could always run away
and join a rock tour.

04:45.160 --> 04:47.276
No, wait, you already did that.

04:49.920 --> 04:53.310
She's had a complicated... year.

04:53.400 --> 04:54.958
I'll talk to her.

05:00.640 --> 05:02.358
Hey, you got a problem?

05:09.920 --> 05:12.388
Nathan, you think I could get
a quick interview?

05:12.480 --> 05:14.675
I'm podcasting a preseason Ravens report.

05:14.760 --> 05:16.113
Podcasting?

05:16.200 --> 05:18.760
Yeah, it's kind of like radio,
but the fans can download it

05:18.840 --> 05:20.796
and listen to it on their iPods.

05:21.480 --> 05:23.835
We're here with Number 23, Nathan Scott.

05:23.920 --> 05:25.911
Nate, what's your prediction
for this Ravens team?

05:26.000 --> 05:29.709
Is this the year that you'll finally claim
that elusive championship trophy,

05:29.800 --> 05:31.950
or will it once again end up
in the arms of someone else?

05:32.040 --> 05:34.998
Someone more popular, better looking,

05:35.080 --> 05:36.911
possibly a surfer,

05:37.000 --> 05:39.833
leaving you empty and angry
with only that final buzzer of regret

05:39.920 --> 05:41.638
ringing in your ears?

05:45.600 --> 05:48.319
I think we'll have a great season.

05:54.920 --> 05:56.148
Oh, no.

05:56.520 --> 06:00.229
- Sometimes I wish I had gone blind.
- Easy, old-timer.

06:00.320 --> 06:04.393
I just came by to congratulate you
on your 400th year at Tree Hill High.

06:06.760 --> 06:09.797
I see Nathan ranked nationally.

06:09.880 --> 06:12.314
Ten spots ahead of you, if memory serves.

06:12.400 --> 06:15.198
Yeah, well, it would have been higher
if they'd gone off last year's record

06:15.280 --> 06:16.713
instead of his weak play
at that damn camp.

06:16.800 --> 06:19.075
Does anything
ever make you happy, Danny?

06:19.520 --> 06:20.999
Actually, yeah.

06:21.840 --> 06:24.149
It's the agenda
for this week's school board meeting.

06:24.240 --> 06:25.593
Take a look at item three.

06:25.680 --> 06:28.592
I put it in 24-point font
so you could read it.

06:32.360 --> 06:33.952
"Replace Whitey Durham."

06:34.040 --> 06:35.473
It's nothing personal.

06:35.560 --> 06:38.791
Wait a minute. Who am I kidding?
Of course it's personal.

06:38.880 --> 06:42.475
You know, it's a shame you didn't burn up
along with your dealership.

06:42.880 --> 06:45.872
But of course,
Dan Scott can survive anything, can't he?

06:46.880 --> 06:48.438
Like a cockroach.

06:50.360 --> 06:53.113
What's the matter, Danny?
I'm just lighting a candle.

06:53.200 --> 06:55.714
Good for the feng shui.

06:55.800 --> 06:57.711
You look a little skittish.

06:57.800 --> 07:00.997
I thought fire was supposed
to be Satan's friend.

07:02.720 --> 07:03.835
It is.

07:04.560 --> 07:07.870
If you see Lucas...
That is, if you're still able to,

07:08.280 --> 07:10.350
tell him I'd like to speak to him.

07:16.120 --> 07:18.270
- Lucas.
- What do you want?

07:18.360 --> 07:21.636
- I need your help.
- I'm sorry. I'm fresh out of heroin.

07:21.720 --> 07:23.631
- Try the Park.
- Wait, Lucas,

07:23.720 --> 07:27.554
you did see me buying drugs,
but it was for medical reasons.

07:27.640 --> 07:31.553
- Let me guess. You're going blind.
- Actually, no. I have cancer.

07:32.400 --> 07:34.311
I didn't want Peyton to know.

07:35.400 --> 07:37.391
Marijuana helps with the nausea.

07:38.320 --> 07:39.799
How far along?

07:39.920 --> 07:41.114
Far enough.

07:41.440 --> 07:42.714
I'm sorry.

07:43.880 --> 07:47.031
I came back here 'cause I needed to know
that Peyton was okay,

07:47.120 --> 07:48.792
that she'd be okay.

07:49.120 --> 07:50.872
She deserves to know.

07:51.360 --> 07:53.157
- You have to tell her.
- I know.

07:53.240 --> 07:56.232
But I want her to get to know me first,
on her own terms,

07:56.320 --> 07:58.390
not because she feels sorry for me.

07:59.960 --> 08:03.794
I thought maybe you could tell her
you made a mistake,

08:04.640 --> 08:07.200
encourage her to give me another chance.

08:23.440 --> 08:24.919
Can I help you?

08:27.080 --> 08:28.479
Taking a walk.

08:28.560 --> 08:30.551
Seeing as I've been doing
a lot of that lately.

08:30.640 --> 08:33.279
How about taking a hike?
You done that lately?

08:34.679 --> 08:37.352
Did I ever tell you about
the dog I found in this park?

08:37.440 --> 08:40.398
I took him into my home
and gave him the best of everything.

08:40.480 --> 08:42.674
Some might say I even spoiled him.

08:43.799 --> 08:45.438
And then one day,

08:45.840 --> 08:46.875
he bit me.

08:46.960 --> 08:48.234
Smart dog.

08:50.360 --> 08:51.509
Point is,

08:52.920 --> 08:54.911
that dog never bit me again.

08:58.080 --> 08:59.991
I get why you come out here.

09:01.160 --> 09:02.878
Fresh air, solitude.

09:04.320 --> 09:05.912
Gives one clarity.

09:06.680 --> 09:08.033
That's important.

09:08.120 --> 09:10.076
Something I've been trying
to grasp at all summer,

09:10.160 --> 09:12.594
but it just kept slipping
through my fingers

09:13.040 --> 09:15.429
until I saw you
the other night at the beach,

09:15.520 --> 09:17.112
at the bonfire.

09:18.920 --> 09:20.638
I know it was you, Lucas.

09:22.080 --> 09:23.911
I don't know what you're talking about.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.230
I saw you at the dealership that night.

09:26.920 --> 09:28.797
You think I wouldn't remember?

09:31.400 --> 09:32.833
Careful, now.

09:32.920 --> 09:34.717
Don't want to get that heart rate up,

09:34.800 --> 09:36.791
especially since you stopped
taking your meds.

09:36.880 --> 09:38.711
It'd be a shame if you collapsed
right here on the court,

09:38.800 --> 09:40.756
and no one to call an ambulance.

09:41.560 --> 09:43.198
Thanks for your concern,

09:44.440 --> 09:45.589
Dad.

09:46.120 --> 09:49.078
I didn't raise you,
so maybe you didn't get the lesson.

09:49.760 --> 09:51.557
But if you're gonna start something,

09:51.640 --> 09:53.710
you sure as hell better finish it.

09:56.400 --> 09:58.709
I'm not playing this game anymore.

10:05.440 --> 10:08.796
Good talk, Son. We'll finish it soon.

10:18.440 --> 10:20.237
What are you doing
on this side of the school?

10:20.320 --> 10:23.517
- Going to P.E.
- Whoa, what? By way of Florida?

10:23.600 --> 10:24.874
You're dodging Haley.

10:24.960 --> 10:26.791
Well, how'd you deal with it
when we first broke up,

10:26.880 --> 10:29.633
aside from immediately trying
to hook up with Lucas?

10:30.320 --> 10:31.309
No, seriously.

10:31.400 --> 10:34.233
I mean, how did you deal with having
to see each other every day?

10:34.320 --> 10:36.754
Really, the only thing I missed
was skipping algebra

10:36.840 --> 10:37.989
and making out in my car.

10:38.080 --> 10:40.548
As much as I loathed kissing you,
algebra was worse.

10:40.640 --> 10:43.996
Do you have any idea how annoying it is
to only go to your locker once a day?

10:44.080 --> 10:45.593
I'm gonna need a good chiropractor.

10:45.680 --> 10:48.797
Let's talk about something happy,
like how we're gonna get evicted

10:48.880 --> 10:50.154
if we don't find money for rent.

10:50.240 --> 10:52.310
Wait a minute.
I thought your parents sent you money.

10:52.400 --> 10:54.709
Well, it barely covered
my back-to-school wardrobe.

10:54.800 --> 10:57.109
You spent your rent money on clothes?

10:57.200 --> 11:00.158
I can't come to school naked.
It wouldn't be very presidential.

11:00.240 --> 11:02.708
Although I suppose I would
never have to worry about re-election.

11:02.800 --> 11:05.553
Oh, my God, it's so good
that you're not treasurer.

11:05.640 --> 11:07.790
By the way, have you talked to Peyton?

11:08.280 --> 11:09.918
I get why Nathan's freezing me out,

11:10.000 --> 11:12.753
but it's not like
I put Peyton up for adoption.

11:13.360 --> 11:16.318
Star forward Nathan Scott
and wife, Haley, face to face.

11:16.400 --> 11:18.994
How will her return affect his game?
Will she destroy his average

11:19.080 --> 11:22.197
like Erica Marsh threatens
to destroy this reporter's GPA?

11:34.160 --> 11:37.152
I don't care how many board members
got their cars at cost.

11:37.240 --> 11:40.232
Forty years of coaching
should count for more than that.

11:42.760 --> 11:46.116
- Hey, Coach.
- Well, well, Avril Lavigne.

11:46.200 --> 11:49.909
- What can I do for you?
- I wanted to talk to you about Nathan.

11:51.240 --> 11:53.231
I'm not exactly
his favorite person right now.

11:53.320 --> 11:57.916
- And you'd like for me to talk to him.
- I was hoping. He really listens to you.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.788
Listen, girlie, I'm a basketball coach,
not Dr. Phil.

12:02.320 --> 12:04.914
I don't have time
for anybody else's problems right now.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.831
- I've got plenty of my own.
- I understand.

12:06.920 --> 12:10.913
Besides that, I should be happy
that my star player's focusing on the game

12:11.000 --> 12:12.513
rather than on his love life.

12:12.600 --> 12:14.830
We got a championship to win this year.

12:15.120 --> 12:16.348
Here.

12:16.440 --> 12:19.113
- What's this?
- It's called a detention slip.

12:19.200 --> 12:20.269
Detention for what?

12:20.360 --> 12:23.318
Last time I checked,
this was the boys' locker room.

12:23.600 --> 12:25.238
Now, take it and go.

12:30.760 --> 12:34.469
So, how is everything going
with Peyton and Ellie?

12:34.560 --> 12:36.790
I don't know. I told Ellie to stay away.

12:37.120 --> 12:40.271
But part of me thinks it might be
a good idea for those two to talk.

12:40.360 --> 12:43.318
- How much do you know about her?
- Not much, really.

12:43.400 --> 12:45.311
We met her
when she was pregnant with Peyton,

12:45.400 --> 12:46.674
looking for an adoptive couple.

12:46.760 --> 12:48.113
She chose us.

12:48.200 --> 12:49.872
What about Peyton's father?

12:50.560 --> 12:52.039
Biological father?

12:52.120 --> 12:54.793
Well, we asked about him,
but she would never talk about him.

12:54.880 --> 12:56.552
I don't know, Karen.

12:56.680 --> 13:00.275
Half the time I'm floating in the Atlantic,
trying to keep a roof over our heads,

13:00.360 --> 13:03.955
and Peyton is scratching her way
through adolescence alone.

13:04.040 --> 13:06.349
Peyton knows that you love her, Larry.

13:06.600 --> 13:08.113
I know she does.

13:08.640 --> 13:10.631
I just don't want to see her hurt again.

13:10.720 --> 13:12.756
You know, I don't know Ellie.

13:12.840 --> 13:14.910
I don't know her intentions,

13:15.000 --> 13:18.356
but this may be the one opportunity
that Peyton has to find out.

13:19.400 --> 13:21.391
I know you want to protect her,

13:21.480 --> 13:24.597
but maybe what she needs
protection from is regret.

13:27.320 --> 13:30.357
Coach Durham, if I said something
to upset you earlier, I'm really sorry.

13:30.440 --> 13:31.919
Take your seat.

13:34.760 --> 13:38.753
- What are you doing here?
- She's got detention, just like you.

13:38.840 --> 13:41.673
What? Are we the only two people
that got in trouble today?

13:42.800 --> 13:44.233
Get lost, kid.

13:45.040 --> 13:46.553
You're pardoned.

13:52.400 --> 13:54.960
Today, we're gonna allow talking.

13:55.600 --> 13:58.478
I believe you two
have some catching up to do.

14:07.040 --> 14:08.553
So, how'd detention go?

14:08.640 --> 14:11.279
It was exactly what it was supposed to be,
punishment.

14:11.360 --> 14:13.874
Nathan looked at me exactly once
when my stomach growled funny

14:13.960 --> 14:15.791
and then stared at the clock
for the rest of the hour.

14:15.880 --> 14:17.996
Well, gave you time to work
on those predictions though, right?

14:18.080 --> 14:19.115
Are you kidding me?

14:19.200 --> 14:21.953
The way this year's going,
I predict I'm gonna get my GED.

14:22.040 --> 14:24.395
- See you at lunch.
- All right.

14:29.640 --> 14:32.791
Excuse me. Aren't you Kelly Clarkson?

14:33.360 --> 14:34.509
Bitch.

14:35.480 --> 14:37.471
You want to try saying that to my face?

14:37.560 --> 14:41.155
You like to sing about stars?
Maybe you'd like to see some.

14:41.240 --> 14:42.878
I have never done anything to you!

14:42.960 --> 14:45.315
Hey, hey! Break it up. Break it up, now!

14:45.400 --> 14:48.198
I'm not gonna have any catfights
on my watch.

14:49.640 --> 14:51.676
Fighting at school? That's a detention.

14:51.760 --> 14:55.514
- Coach, she started it!
- Talking back to a teacher? That's two.

14:55.600 --> 14:58.114
Whitey, I really appreciate it,
but I don't think it's gonna work...

14:58.200 --> 15:00.509
Calling me "Whitey" is three.

15:00.600 --> 15:03.398
- Okay, I think two's enough.
- I'm serious about that third one.

15:03.480 --> 15:05.198
I'll see you in detention.

15:20.520 --> 15:23.432
You really knock out
Sue Garvey's front tooth?

15:24.840 --> 15:27.070
What? Where did you hear that?

15:27.160 --> 15:28.673
It's all over school.

15:28.760 --> 15:31.320
Great. Add "bully" to my résumé now.

15:32.920 --> 15:35.718
You know, I played for some tough crowds
on the road.

15:35.800 --> 15:39.270
Nothing compares to the hostility
I feel walking down that hallway.

15:39.760 --> 15:42.115
What did I even do to make
those girls hate me anyway?

15:42.200 --> 15:43.235
They don't even know me.

15:43.320 --> 15:45.709
It's high school. They don't need a reason.

15:46.400 --> 15:48.630
Try missing the winning shot
at a home game.

15:48.720 --> 15:50.995
You'll feel hatred at a whole new level.

15:52.880 --> 15:55.519
Yeah, I guess I never thought
of it that way.

16:00.520 --> 16:03.353
- Nathan...
- I should get back to this.

16:03.440 --> 16:05.271
I don't have a tutor anymore.

16:16.240 --> 16:17.434
Let me guess.

16:17.520 --> 16:19.397
Mom's not home.
She doesn't know you're here.

16:19.480 --> 16:21.311
Well, technically,
we haven't divided our assets yet.

16:21.400 --> 16:23.960
Technically, hanging around the house
when your wife's kicked you to the curb

16:24.040 --> 16:26.474
- makes you a loser.
- Well, I guess you'd know, right?

16:26.560 --> 16:28.869
Come on, get suited up.
We'll play one-on-one.

16:28.960 --> 16:30.518
Where you been anyway?

16:31.240 --> 16:32.639
I had detention.

16:33.040 --> 16:35.349
Nathan, you can't afford
to be a discipline case.

16:35.440 --> 16:38.113
- This stuff gets back to the scouts.
- No, it wasn't like that.

16:38.200 --> 16:40.430
Whitey's just playing games
with me and Haley.

16:40.520 --> 16:41.669
Whitey, huh?

16:41.760 --> 16:43.591
Well, you won't have to worry
about him much longer.

16:43.680 --> 16:45.477
What does that mean?

16:45.840 --> 16:47.671
I'm looking out for you, Son.

16:48.200 --> 16:52.159
I'm going before the school board tonight.
We're gonna get you a real coach.

16:53.080 --> 16:54.195
Swish!

16:54.640 --> 16:57.518
I'm only saying
maybe I was wrong about Ellie.

16:58.120 --> 17:00.998
Who knows what I saw.
It could've been any number of things.

17:01.080 --> 17:03.275
What? Crack? Speed?
Maybe she's huffing model-airplane glue.

17:03.360 --> 17:04.554
That's not what I mean.

17:04.640 --> 17:07.108
Lucas, I confronted her about it.
She didn't deny it.

17:07.200 --> 17:08.758
There could be some explanation.

17:08.839 --> 17:11.434
There's always an explanation with her.
It's called lying.

17:11.520 --> 17:13.954
Why are you on the Ellie train
all of a sudden anyway?

17:14.040 --> 17:15.189
I'm not.

17:15.280 --> 17:18.157
I'm just saying
maybe you should give her a chance.

17:23.079 --> 17:24.148
Hey.

17:24.480 --> 17:25.549
Hi, Peyton.

17:25.960 --> 17:28.269
- What are you doing here?
- I invited her.

17:28.359 --> 17:30.999
I thought maybe we could all talk.

17:31.440 --> 17:33.158
I had no idea how gifted you were.

17:33.240 --> 17:34.673
You set me up.

17:34.960 --> 17:37.758
- No, I...
- Hey, Peyton, wait, wait. Listen.

17:37.840 --> 17:41.230
No, you listen! This is my world, okay?
That's my music.

17:41.320 --> 17:44.710
This is my art,
art that has everything to do with Mom.

17:45.200 --> 17:48.795
My real mom, okay?
I can't believe you would do this to me.

17:50.640 --> 17:52.198
Did you know about this?

17:52.280 --> 17:53.554
Peyton.

17:53.680 --> 17:56.717
No, just... Just stay out of my life, okay?

17:56.800 --> 17:58.119
All of you.

17:59.680 --> 18:01.113
It's my fault.

18:10.400 --> 18:12.516
Good news. Our money troubles are over.

18:12.600 --> 18:15.068
- I am a working girl.
- Is that legal?

18:15.160 --> 18:18.152
I am now the newest employee
at Suburban Filth.

18:18.240 --> 18:19.389
It's a clothing store.

18:19.480 --> 18:22.199
"Suburban Filth." That's perfect.

18:24.200 --> 18:25.599
What have you got there?

18:25.680 --> 18:29.309
These, my dear roommate,
are hair scrunchies circa 1995,

18:29.400 --> 18:32.153
and they are what is going to make
this little living arrangement bearable.

18:32.240 --> 18:34.913
Brooke, I know you never liked my hair,
but it's just...

18:35.000 --> 18:37.958
No. Well, true, but no.

18:38.040 --> 18:40.270
When either of us has a boy over,

18:40.360 --> 18:42.555
these scrunchies will be
our first line of defense.

18:42.640 --> 18:46.349
Observe. Red scrunchie means "occupied."

18:46.440 --> 18:48.237
Some serious action going on in here.

18:48.320 --> 18:51.153
The yellow scrunchie means
we're just making out,

18:51.240 --> 18:52.593
but one or more of us may be topless.

18:52.680 --> 18:54.033
And the black one?

18:54.120 --> 18:56.395
You're gonna have to leave the apartment.

18:56.480 --> 18:59.074
Well, I'm not sure I can handle
thinking of you and Lucas

18:59.160 --> 19:01.151
hooking up in the same room
where I'm sleeping.

19:01.240 --> 19:04.277
- Lucas and/ or others.
- Brooke, it's a...

19:04.360 --> 19:06.271
It's a really good system.

19:06.360 --> 19:09.193
But I just really don't think
I'm gonna be needing any scrunchies

19:09.280 --> 19:12.909
- any time soon, so...
- No, no, roommate, come here.

19:13.960 --> 19:16.952
Come on. Nathan's gonna come around.

19:17.720 --> 19:20.518
He just needs to know
you're here for the long haul.

19:25.280 --> 19:26.599
You know,

19:28.680 --> 19:32.309
sometimes people play hard to get
because they need to know

19:32.520 --> 19:34.715
the other person's feelings are real.

19:46.240 --> 19:48.390
Nathan. It's been a long time.

19:48.480 --> 19:50.710
Yeah. Have you seen Lucas?

19:50.800 --> 19:54.315
- Not for a few hours.
- Okay. Thanks.

19:55.200 --> 19:56.349
Nathan.

19:58.560 --> 19:59.834
Haley came back.

20:01.080 --> 20:02.115
Yeah.

20:03.680 --> 20:04.908
Do you...

20:05.000 --> 20:07.230
Do you remember
that day on the river court

20:07.320 --> 20:09.914
when you told me that you would
give anything to have her home?

20:10.000 --> 20:11.115
Yeah.

20:11.200 --> 20:12.952
- Yeah, you told me to have faith.
- Yeah.

20:13.040 --> 20:16.635
Well, faith is believing
when there's nothing else you can do.

20:17.920 --> 20:19.399
She's here now.

20:21.440 --> 20:23.351
What are you gonna do about it?

20:24.400 --> 20:25.799
Haley's here.

20:25.920 --> 20:29.071
Just don't know if the guy she left
is ever gonna come back.

20:32.880 --> 20:35.872
And if you see Lucas,
tell him he might want to come

20:35.960 --> 20:37.439
to the school board meeting tonight.

20:37.520 --> 20:39.351
- School board?
- Yeah.

20:39.440 --> 20:41.510
My dad's trying to get Whitey fired,

20:41.960 --> 20:45.111
and we both know
he usually gets what he wants.

21:10.400 --> 21:12.516
I thought you might be here.

21:14.720 --> 21:18.269
Ever since your mom died,
I've been guessing a lot.

21:18.960 --> 21:20.791
Sometimes I guess wrong.

21:22.720 --> 21:26.554
I shouldn't have brought Ellie
into your room without asking.

21:28.240 --> 21:30.549
But she didn't have anything to do with it.

21:30.640 --> 21:32.198
Neither did Lucas.

21:35.040 --> 21:36.951
Sometimes you guess right.

21:38.840 --> 21:40.671
You guessed where to find me.

21:48.400 --> 21:50.516
This has all been a lot to take.

21:53.760 --> 21:56.194
I want you to know
you can always talk to me.

21:57.040 --> 21:58.996
But sometimes I can't, Dad.

21:59.560 --> 22:01.312
If you're not always comfortable
talking with me,

22:02.720 --> 22:04.915
maybe we should find you someone.

22:04.560 --> 22:06.152
Like a shrink?

22:08.200 --> 22:10.794
Well, it might help you
to get some of this out.

22:09.880 --> 22:11.029
Just beyond these doors,

22:25.720 --> 22:28.029
Coach Durham's fate is being decided
as we speak.

22:26.960 --> 22:28.154
The tension is palpable.

22:29.360 --> 22:32.193
The only audible sounds
are the heartbeats of this Ravens team

22:30.640 --> 22:32.596
beating in unison for its beloved coach.

22:33.560 --> 22:35.232
My heart would be beating, too,

22:35.600 --> 22:38.558
but it's been ripped out and
stomped on by one Erica Marsh.

22:37.360 --> 22:40.318
Mouth, got a second?

22:40.400 --> 22:43.949
Look, I know what you're going through,
man, but at a certain point

22:47.920 --> 22:50.070
you gotta stop wearing
your heart on your sleeve.

22:51.560 --> 22:54.279
In fact, your whole shirt's
getting a little ripe.

22:53.800 --> 22:55.711
That's easy for you to say, Luke.

22:56.600 --> 22:58.511
You get your heart broken

22:58.600 --> 23:00.989
and there's a dozen girls
waiting to put it back together.

23:00.600 --> 23:02.830
It doesn't work like that for me.

23:03.080 --> 23:05.913
And even if it did, I don't want it to.

23:05.600 --> 23:07.272
I just want Erica back.

23:10.480 --> 23:13.790
<i>To the school board, concerned parents,</i>

23:15.400 --> 23:16.719
<i>Mr. Mayor,</i>

23:19.080 --> 23:21.674
<i>I think Coach Durham 's record</i>
<i>speaks for itself.</i>

23:20.480 --> 23:22.311
<i>He's never won a state title.</i>

23:24.000 --> 23:25.911
<i>In fact, the closest he ever came</i>
<i>were those years</i>

23:26.200 --> 23:28.077
<i>where myself and my sons</i>
<i>were on the team.</i>

23:28.200 --> 23:31.510
<i>Now, let's face it.</i>
<i>Whitey's running out of my DNA.</i>

23:30.160 --> 23:32.435
<i>This is Nathan's final year at Tree Hill</i>

23:36.640 --> 23:38.358
<i>and a lot of the other boys, too.</i>

23:39.000 --> 23:42.197
<i>We may not have another chance</i>
<i>like this for decades.</i>

23:40.800 --> 23:42.199
<i>Now, I love Whitey.</i>

23:44.120 --> 23:46.270
<i>He's an institution in this town,</i>

23:46.320 --> 23:48.390
<i>but this is bigger than just one man.</i>

23:48.560 --> 23:49.959
<i>This is about civic pride.</i>

23:50.720 --> 23:53.678
<i>This is about driving into Tree Hill</i>
<i>in the middle of the night</i>

23:52.200 --> 23:54.839
<i>and seeing your headlights</i>
<i>splash that sign,</i>

23:55.240 --> 23:57.515
<i>"Welcome to Tree Hill,</i>
<i>home of the Ravens,</i>

23:57.960 --> 24:00.633
<i>"North Carolina</i>
<i>State Basketball Champions. "</i>

24:00.320 --> 24:02.709
<i>It gives me chills just thinking about it.</i>

24:03.480 --> 24:05.550
<i>And our kids deserve</i>
<i>to have that feeling, too.</i>

24:06.280 --> 24:08.396
<i>Hell, so does all of Tree Hill.</i>

24:08.440 --> 24:11.159
<i>Now, if we make the change</i>
<i>by replacing Coach Durham,</i>

24:11.080 --> 24:13.071
<i>we can get there this year.</i>

24:13.880 --> 24:15.472
<i>I honestly believe that.</i>

24:16.400 --> 24:17.549
<i>Thank you.</i>

24:18.680 --> 24:21.148
Well, thank you, Mr. Scott.

24:21.600 --> 24:23.477
Time to call this to a vote.

24:26.120 --> 24:28.156
I would like to say something.

24:28.400 --> 24:29.628
Mayor Mullins,

24:31.720 --> 24:33.597
Miss Roe is not a member
of the school board.

24:33.040 --> 24:35.759
As a matter of fact, I don't think
I've ever seen her at a meeting before.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.912
- I object.
- Well, this is not a court of law, Dan.

24:37.800 --> 24:39.233
We go by my rules.

24:40.800 --> 24:42.028
Sit down.

24:43.000 --> 24:44.877
Please go ahead, Miss Roe.

24:47.800 --> 24:48.949
<i>Thank you.</i>

24:50.640 --> 24:53.518
<i>Most of you know me.</i>
<i>I am Lucas Scott's mom.</i>

24:52.280 --> 24:56.512
<i>I run a café downtown,</i>
<i>and Lucas joined the Ravens last year.</i>

24:55.240 --> 24:57.708
<i>What you don't know</i>
<i>is that I was against it.</i>

25:00.040 --> 25:02.713
<i>Whitey knew that,</i>
<i>but he recruited him anyway.</i>

25:03.080 --> 25:05.389
<i>I was against it for good reason.</i>

25:08.120 --> 25:11.476
<i>Because I have seen</i>
<i>what this game can turn people into,</i>

25:11.560 --> 25:14.393
<i>and I was worried that</i>
<i>that would happen to my son.</i>

25:15.000 --> 25:18.959
<i>What I didn't realize</i>
<i>is how what Whitey teaches these boys</i>

25:18.280 --> 25:20.077
<i>goes beyond the simple game.</i>

25:22.320 --> 25:24.788
<i>I have seen his influence in my own son</i>

25:25.160 --> 25:26.991
<i>beyond the x's and the o's,</i>

25:27.720 --> 25:30.359
<i>and so have all the other parents</i>
<i>in this room.</i>

25:29.640 --> 25:31.710
<i>Our boys are becoming men,</i>

25:32.960 --> 25:36.794
<i>and I cannot put that into statistics.</i>

25:35.640 --> 25:38.234
<i>It may not translate into championships.</i>

25:39.560 --> 25:42.632
<i>But if you put too much focus</i>
<i>on those things,</i>

25:42.320 --> 25:45.949
<i>in the end, all you're gonna end</i>
<i>up with is a sad bunch of boys</i>

25:46.520 --> 25:49.432
<i>who never learned</i>
<i>to leave the game behind.</i>

25:50.240 --> 25:51.719
<i>Unlike Dan Scott,</i>

25:54.320 --> 25:57.232
<i>I don't believe</i>
<i>that our sons deserve anything.</i>

25:55.880 --> 25:57.393
<i>You get what you earn.</i>

25:59.320 --> 26:02.471
<i>But Coach Durham, he deserves better.</i>

26:02.880 --> 26:04.677
<i>He's already earned it.</i>

26:07.320 --> 26:09.276
So, my mom told me
you came looking for me.

26:19.960 --> 26:22.679
It wasn't about you. Just wanted to
make sure everybody knew about Whitey.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.309
So you do care about something
besides basketball.

26:24.800 --> 26:27.394
Whitey gets me touches.
He knows it's my team.

26:27.200 --> 26:30.431
- Pretty soon the scouts will, too.
- Your team, huh?

26:29.880 --> 26:33.793
Yeah, I guess we'll see about that
when we get back on the court, won't we?

26:33.960 --> 26:34.949
- Hey.
- Hi.

26:39.840 --> 26:42.752
Listen, about earlier, I'm sorry.
I didn't know that she...

26:40.920 --> 26:43.559
I know. My dad told me
you weren't on the grassy knoll.

26:43.920 --> 26:45.433
Look, I'm sorry.

26:46.640 --> 26:48.835
You're actually one of the few people
that's been honest with me

26:48.240 --> 26:49.798
through this whole thing.

26:50.520 --> 26:52.556
So, what are you doing after this?

26:52.160 --> 26:53.832
Bad news, gentlemen.

27:04.960 --> 27:06.552
You're stuck with me.

27:08.640 --> 27:10.995
We're going all the way this season!

27:25.440 --> 27:27.749
Been a while
since we've been in here, huh?

27:32.080 --> 27:33.877
I'm in here every night.

27:34.960 --> 27:36.439
My mind, anyway.

27:36.840 --> 27:40.879
Replaying the shot you missed,
the shot that ended our season,

27:38.480 --> 27:41.153
the shot you've probably made,
what, 1,000 times?

27:42.600 --> 27:43.635
Okay.

27:45.360 --> 27:47.316
So, what do you have to tell me?

27:47.840 --> 27:49.193
How'd you know?

27:51.200 --> 27:54.237
Well, I figured you either
brought me in here to talk,

27:52.640 --> 27:54.392
to make out, or to kill me.

27:55.760 --> 27:59.309
And since we're not gonna make out,
I guess it's talk or die, right?

27:57.600 --> 27:58.874
Is it bad?

28:01.840 --> 28:02.875
Yeah.

28:03.440 --> 28:05.829
Let me guess. I've got three moms.

28:04.800 --> 28:08.270
Ellie was buying marijuana,
but not for the reasons you think.

28:10.400 --> 28:11.549
She's sick.

28:13.960 --> 28:15.552
She has cancer, Peyton.

28:16.320 --> 28:17.639
She told you that.

28:18.400 --> 28:21.358
Come on, Luke,
that's just another one of her lies.

28:21.080 --> 28:22.399
I don't think so.

28:24.120 --> 28:26.270
I think she was afraid
that if you knew the truth,

28:26.000 --> 28:28.150
you'd feel obligated to her some way,

28:28.240 --> 28:31.073
that it would change things between you
for the wrong reasons.

28:30.600 --> 28:33.831
Kind of like your little secret
about Dan and the fire.

28:33.520 --> 28:35.636
And what little secret is that?

28:37.800 --> 28:41.156
Sorry to interrupt your little melodrama,
but Lucas and I have unfinished business.

28:40.840 --> 28:43.912
- Peyton, you should go.
- Yeah, we're both going.

28:44.280 --> 28:47.909
A bit oedipal, don't you think?
Trying to kill Daddy?

28:47.440 --> 28:49.795
Someone should tell Mom
she's in for some action.

28:51.400 --> 28:53.675
You don't know what happened that night.

28:53.840 --> 28:56.400
You can't remember, and it's killing you.

28:58.520 --> 28:59.589
Enlighten me.

29:01.520 --> 29:03.192
- Let go!
- Leave him alone!

29:02.680 --> 29:05.114
This is a family matter.
You'd understand that if you had one.

29:04.440 --> 29:05.839
You son of a bitch!

29:06.960 --> 29:09.838
My record on this court's
a little better than yours, Lucas.

29:11.360 --> 29:12.395
Don't...

29:14.440 --> 29:16.396
- You really think you can try to kill me?
- Stop it!

29:16.120 --> 29:17.951
- You think you can get away with this?
- Let go!

29:18.160 --> 29:19.513
There are easier ways
to kill a man, Lucas.

29:20.080 --> 29:21.433
He wasn't trying to kill you!

29:21.520 --> 29:23.988
- Like choking!
- He saved your life!

29:22.960 --> 29:25.076
Lucas, please,
you're gonna have to tell him.

29:36.880 --> 29:38.199
I was there,

29:41.880 --> 29:43.313
but not to kill you.

29:44.360 --> 29:45.952
<i>I saved your life.</i>

30:39.720 --> 30:41.836
<i>But I should've let you burn.</i>

30:43.440 --> 30:45.510
Well, a stronger man would've.

30:54.400 --> 30:58.029
This will be our secret, Lucas.
And that goes for you, too, Miss Sawyer.

31:00.040 --> 31:02.349
Luke, I'm sorry. I had to tell him.

31:16.440 --> 31:18.237
It's all right. I know.

31:19.960 --> 31:21.109
Are you okay?

31:22.400 --> 31:23.879
That's my father.

31:25.600 --> 31:27.192
What do you think?

31:27.640 --> 31:30.074
If I were you, I'd keep those boxes packed.

31:48.480 --> 31:49.629
What are you still doing here?

31:51.640 --> 31:53.790
You mean other than paying the bills?

31:52.880 --> 31:54.359
It's over, Dad.

31:56.160 --> 31:57.434
Let it go.

31:58.280 --> 32:01.192
Can't blame a guy for trying to hold on,
can you?

32:02.920 --> 32:05.036
I hear this place is open all night.

32:18.880 --> 32:21.269
- You heard right.
- Okay, thanks.

32:21.480 --> 32:24.756
And now that I have a new job,
we eat, too.

32:23.960 --> 32:26.918
Pizza's on the way. I'm gonna change.
You guys hang.

32:27.320 --> 32:28.833
What happened to you?

32:30.760 --> 32:32.876
This pickup game got a little rough.

32:33.320 --> 32:34.719
What are you doing?

32:36.040 --> 32:37.996
I'm just looking through
this list of predictions

32:38.440 --> 32:40.396
and dreams and wishes
I made over the years.

32:40.480 --> 32:43.153
You know, I really think that maybe
back then I was a better person.

32:42.520 --> 32:44.476
You're the same person
you've always been,

32:45.280 --> 32:47.316
but that's not a list of who you are.

32:47.320 --> 32:51.916
That's a list of who you're gonna be,
and that's still up to you.

32:49.440 --> 32:50.509
Yeah.

32:54.880 --> 32:56.472
Well, whatever I want to happen this year,

32:56.040 --> 32:58.600
I'm gonna just predict the opposite,
'cause life always has a way

32:57.720 --> 32:59.915
of figuring out how to surprise you.

33:00.360 --> 33:01.554
That was fast.

33:04.400 --> 33:06.152
You pitching in, you mooch?

33:06.480 --> 33:07.629
Hey!

33:12.320 --> 33:13.958
Nice place.

33:13.760 --> 33:15.318
Can I talk to you?

33:15.480 --> 33:16.515
Yeah.

33:17.880 --> 33:19.472
I'm glad it's you that stopped by.

33:26.280 --> 33:28.510
Living with Brooke,
you never know who's gonna come in

33:27.960 --> 33:29.791
for a late-night booty call.

33:30.280 --> 33:31.474
Look,

33:33.320 --> 33:35.834
I've been doing some thinking about us,

33:35.080 --> 33:37.878
about what we're gonna do,

33:37.800 --> 33:39.677
and I still have the annulment papers.

33:40.680 --> 33:42.352
But if we get an annulment,

33:42.640 --> 33:44.790
that means that our marriage
never happened,

33:44.400 --> 33:46.072
and that'd be a lie.

33:46.640 --> 33:48.517
And we had a lot of great times together,
Haley.

33:49.320 --> 33:51.550
I don't want to pretend like we didn't.

33:51.280 --> 33:52.713
Neither do I.

33:54.080 --> 33:56.196
So, instead of an annulment,

33:57.360 --> 33:59.157
I've looked into a divorce.

33:59.560 --> 34:02.313
The State says we'd have to be separated
for a year.

34:06.600 --> 34:07.749
What?

34:10.239 --> 34:13.038
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying that I...

34:13.600 --> 34:16.637
I think we should see what
happens between now and then.

34:17.480 --> 34:19.835
Nathan, I love you.

34:20.679 --> 34:23.353
I know that we can work this out,
and a year from now

34:25.080 --> 34:26.831
things will be good for us again.

34:27.840 --> 34:30.717
Maybe, but maybe not.

34:29.679 --> 34:31.795
I guess we'll just have to see.

34:35.040 --> 34:36.473
I should probably go.

34:45.960 --> 34:47.871
What, you're just gonna eat
Haley's half of the pizza

34:48.040 --> 34:49.234
and then run?

34:50.040 --> 34:54.750
Let's be optimistic.
Nathan and Haley have a lot of problems.

34:51.320 --> 34:53.594
They'll probably be out all night,

34:56.120 --> 34:58.475
and you know I hate to sleep alone.

34:59.120 --> 35:02.396
- I would love to spend the night, Brooke.
- Yeah?

35:03.560 --> 35:04.709
Yeah,

35:08.040 --> 35:09.951
as soon as we're exclusive.

35:09.880 --> 35:14.032
You're good. But before you go,

35:11.880 --> 35:16.158
did I mention that one of the perks
of my new job

35:16.120 --> 35:19.635
is that I get to take home free samples?

35:20.480 --> 35:23.153
You're better. Much better.

35:29.920 --> 35:31.717
So are we staying yet?

35:33.800 --> 35:35.518
Are we exclusive yet?

35:37.880 --> 35:39.677
Game on, Brooke Davis.

35:44.680 --> 35:46.398
Well, that's a first.

35:55.520 --> 35:58.193
Mouth McFadden,
newsman extraordinaire.

36:05.200 --> 36:06.872
What are you doing out so late?

36:08.400 --> 36:12.154
I was hoping I could get a statement
about your first win of the season.

36:10.160 --> 36:12.833
I'll go you one better than that.

36:15.440 --> 36:17.158
I'll give you an exclusive.

36:18.400 --> 36:20.470
This will be my final season.

36:25.160 --> 36:27.549
The end of this year, win or lose,

36:28.000 --> 36:29.194
I'm retiring.

36:30.760 --> 36:31.875
But why?

36:33.280 --> 36:35.316
That's it. That's your scoop.

36:34.480 --> 36:36.391
And do me a favor,

36:36.680 --> 36:39.638
keep it under wraps
until after the first game.

36:38.800 --> 36:43.351
Hey, Coach, could I ask you
one more question, off the record?

36:55.200 --> 36:57.714
How do you deal
with losing someone you love?

37:02.200 --> 37:03.838
Shut the door, son.

37:11.360 --> 37:12.918
Pull up a chair.

37:13.840 --> 37:16.070
<i>Henry Wadsworth Longfellow wrote,</i>

37:40.640 --> 37:42.676
<i>"All are architects of fate</i>

37:43.440 --> 37:46.318
<i>"So look not mournfully into the past</i>

37:47.760 --> 37:49.671
<i>"It comes not back again"</i>

37:50.720 --> 37:55.350
My dad said I should talk to someone,
so I'm talking to you,

38:23.560 --> 38:24.834
all of you.

38:29.960 --> 38:31.552
Where do I begin?

38:32.200 --> 38:35.078
Well, I guess until a few days ago,

38:33.880 --> 38:36.519
I thought my mom was my mom

38:36.840 --> 38:38.592
and my dad was my dad.

38:39.560 --> 38:41.676
Come on. We're late for class.
