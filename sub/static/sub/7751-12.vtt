00:01.134 --> 00:03.602
<i>Previously on "devious maids"...</i>

00:03.604 --> 00:05.070
She took my kid.
Drinking
won't get him back.

00:05.072 --> 00:07.773
You're my maid, carmen.
Not my mom.

00:07.775 --> 00:09.108
Go to rehab.

00:09.110 --> 00:10.409
When you get back...

00:10.411 --> 00:12.644
I will be here waiting for you.

00:12.646 --> 00:14.079
What's wrong?

00:14.081 --> 00:15.647
There's a problem
with my kidneys.

00:15.649 --> 00:18.350
Seems the little buggers
are starting to shut down.

00:18.352 --> 00:20.619
My father kicked me out
of this house because of you.

00:20.621 --> 00:22.354
I don't want her to leave.

00:22.356 --> 00:23.589
It's didi.

00:23.591 --> 00:25.190
What's going on?

00:25.192 --> 00:26.425
Uncle ken asked me
and his business managers

00:26.427 --> 00:28.660
To inform didi
that he wants a divorce.

00:28.662 --> 00:30.029
We have to get you out of here

00:30.031 --> 00:31.330
Before reggie sends you away.

00:31.332 --> 00:33.032
This man isn't supposed
to have visitors.

00:33.034 --> 00:34.466
Mr. Kenneth
was getting stronger.

00:34.468 --> 00:36.235
He wanted to take back control
of his business,

00:36.237 --> 00:37.703
So you made him fall.

00:37.705 --> 00:39.338
There's an immigration hearing
next week.

00:39.340 --> 00:41.440
It could go well
for you and your son...

00:41.442 --> 00:42.741
Or not so well.

00:42.743 --> 00:44.309
I want us to hit another house.

00:44.311 --> 00:45.611
Are you high?

00:45.613 --> 00:47.414
Last time we went out,
carter killed somebody.

00:50.316 --> 00:51.517
We've got to get out of here!

00:51.519 --> 00:53.252
Did you
tell someone?
Valentina.

00:53.254 --> 00:55.187
If she tells someone...
I don't think
she will.

00:55.189 --> 00:56.455
But I'm getting out
just in case.

00:56.457 --> 00:57.657
You might want to do the same.

00:57.658 --> 00:58.724
We call the police now.

00:58.726 --> 01:00.292
I can't turn ethan in!

01:00.294 --> 01:02.161
I spent 14 months in jail.

01:02.163 --> 01:04.096
Please don't make
the same mistake I did.

01:04.098 --> 01:06.165
I've decided to tell the police
about ethan.

01:06.167 --> 01:07.132
You're doing the right thing.

01:07.134 --> 01:08.600
Good morning, javier.

01:08.602 --> 01:10.269
So, javier's a good guy?

01:10.271 --> 01:11.770
He's great.

01:11.772 --> 01:14.640
But today,
I was thanking god for you.

01:14.642 --> 01:15.774
Who did you kill, nick?

01:15.776 --> 01:17.843
I'm not a murderer.

01:17.845 --> 01:19.745
Opal, no!

01:21.000 --> 01:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:31.491 --> 01:34.226
Just... I had no idea
she was that crazy.

01:34.228 --> 01:37.162
We're so sorry.

01:39.466 --> 01:42.668
Mrs. Deering,
your husband's here.

01:42.670 --> 01:44.303
What the hell's going on?

01:44.305 --> 01:45.871
Opal is dead.

01:45.873 --> 01:47.372
What?

01:47.374 --> 01:49.241
She shot herself last night.

01:49.243 --> 01:51.510
Here? Wh...

01:51.512 --> 01:53.178
Oh, my god.

01:53.180 --> 01:55.848
And now we need to talk.

01:58.485 --> 02:01.720
To witness
something like that...

02:01.722 --> 02:03.255
I can't imagine.

02:03.257 --> 02:04.590
It was awful.

02:04.592 --> 02:05.624
Oh.

02:05.626 --> 02:07.526
I'm sorry.

02:07.528 --> 02:09.261
I-I'm sorry.

02:09.263 --> 02:11.797
I-I-I thought
under the circumstances...

02:14.767 --> 02:16.668
I learned something last night.

02:16.670 --> 02:18.303
What's that?

02:18.305 --> 02:20.873
It was opal who pushed dahlia
off the bridge.

02:20.875 --> 02:22.774
At first, I was relieved,

02:22.776 --> 02:25.477
But then it occurred to me,

02:25.479 --> 02:28.814
"why would you keep her secret
all these years

02:28.816 --> 02:32.217
Unless you had
a secret of your own?"

02:32.219 --> 02:36.488
And it would have to be
pretty terrible for you

02:36.490 --> 02:39.758
To let your wife's death
to go unpunished.

02:39.760 --> 02:42.361
So...

02:42.363 --> 02:44.363
Maybe you <i>did kill someone.</i>

02:44.365 --> 02:46.165
Okay, the house
is full of strangers.

02:46.167 --> 02:47.199
Can we discuss it later?

02:47.201 --> 02:48.901
I won't be here later.

02:50.870 --> 02:52.604
Where was opal staying?

02:52.606 --> 02:54.473
Some apartment.
Why?

02:54.475 --> 02:55.674
I-I-I gave her
a watch once

02:55.676 --> 02:57.309
That belonged to my grandmother.

02:57.311 --> 02:59.431
I'd like to get it back.
Y-you don't know the address?

03:00.380 --> 03:01.813
She banks at beverly pacific.

03:01.815 --> 03:03.916
I'm sure they'll know
where she was staying.

03:03.918 --> 03:05.918
So...

03:05.920 --> 03:08.720
You're not gonna tell me
what you did?

03:08.722 --> 03:10.822
It's not what you think.

03:18.865 --> 03:20.866
So, how did it go?

03:20.868 --> 03:22.968
All he would talk about
is opal's apartment.

03:22.970 --> 03:24.670
Why?

03:24.672 --> 03:26.338
She was blackmailing him,

03:26.340 --> 03:28.207
Maybe she had some
physical proof of what he did.

03:28.209 --> 03:30.742
You need to get to that
apartment before nick does.

03:30.744 --> 03:32.678
Do you know
where she was staying?

03:32.680 --> 03:36.215
As a matter of fact, I do.

04:02.342 --> 04:03.976
Morning.

04:03.978 --> 04:06.778
Oh, crap.

04:06.780 --> 04:09.314
Did we have sex last night?

04:09.316 --> 04:10.482
No.

04:10.484 --> 04:12.417
Oh, thank you, lord.

04:12.419 --> 04:14.653
We made love.

04:14.655 --> 04:16.288
Oh.

04:16.290 --> 04:19.725
Thanks for nothing.

04:23.731 --> 04:25.030
<i>Mami!</i>

04:25.032 --> 04:26.632
Oh!

04:26.634 --> 04:28.634
<i>Mija,</i> what are you doing here?

04:28.636 --> 04:30.936
I have to meet
with the police at 9:00

04:30.938 --> 04:32.838
To talk to them about ethan.

04:32.840 --> 04:35.474
Is it okay that I crashed here
last night?

04:35.476 --> 04:36.642
Of course.

04:36.644 --> 04:38.644
I just wish
you'd called me first.

04:38.646 --> 04:41.346
Two cups of coffee, huh?

04:41.348 --> 04:44.683
Yeah, the doctor thinks
I need more caffeine in my diet.

04:44.685 --> 04:46.285
Come on.

04:46.287 --> 04:47.586
I know you had company.

04:47.588 --> 04:49.821
You do?
Well, I can explain.

04:49.823 --> 04:51.423
It's okay.

04:51.425 --> 04:53.358
I really like javier.

04:53.360 --> 04:54.493
Who?

04:54.495 --> 04:56.662
Oh, right. Javier.

04:56.664 --> 04:57.996
He's so sweet.

04:57.998 --> 04:59.464
I don't think you could have
picked a nicer guy.

04:59.466 --> 05:01.667
Yeah, I'd be a fool
to mess that up.

05:03.437 --> 05:05.737
And <i>papi</i> left <i>you.</i>

05:05.739 --> 05:09.408
I think that means you can sleep
with whoever you want.

05:11.044 --> 05:12.444
Morning.

05:13.713 --> 05:14.846
<i>Mami?</i>

05:14.848 --> 05:17.049
Hold that thought, sweetness.

05:17.051 --> 05:19.885
What are you doing here?

05:19.887 --> 05:21.420
I picked up some <i>pastelitos.</i>

05:21.422 --> 05:23.388
I thought we could have
breakfast together.

05:23.390 --> 05:24.723
Fantastic!

05:24.725 --> 05:26.391
But we should eat them
in the park.

05:26.393 --> 05:27.492
Why?

05:27.494 --> 05:29.528
Food tastes better outside.

05:29.530 --> 05:32.030
You're a chef.
You should know that!

05:32.032 --> 05:36.001
If anyone should ask
where I've gone, <i>anyone</i> at all,

05:36.003 --> 05:37.769
I'll be back soon.

05:38.871 --> 05:40.605
Okay.

05:41.974 --> 05:44.676
Hey, <i>mija!</i>

05:44.678 --> 05:46.478
Dad?!

05:46.480 --> 05:48.513
Got exciting news...

05:48.515 --> 05:52.851
Looks like your mom and I
are back together.

05:59.426 --> 06:01.493
I must say I was surprised
to get your call.

06:01.495 --> 06:03.362
It's been ages.

06:03.364 --> 06:05.731
And I feel awful about that.

06:05.733 --> 06:08.667
I do enjoy you
and evelyn so much.

06:08.669 --> 06:11.770
Are you sure there's not
another reason for this visit?

06:11.772 --> 06:14.139
I detected a hint of desperation
in your voice

06:14.141 --> 06:15.440
When you called.

06:15.442 --> 06:17.109
It's true.

06:17.111 --> 06:19.911
I'm here because
I need something.

06:19.913 --> 06:22.047
Then you came
to the right place.

06:22.049 --> 06:24.649
I never could say no
to a pretty face.

06:25.719 --> 06:26.852
What is it you need?

06:26.854 --> 06:28.653
A kidney.

06:28.655 --> 06:30.122
Beg pardon?

06:30.124 --> 06:32.791
I have renal failure,

06:32.793 --> 06:34.793
So I'm asking people
to get tested

06:34.795 --> 06:36.862
In the hopes someone
will be a match

06:36.864 --> 06:38.597
And give me their kidney.

06:40.099 --> 06:42.100
Well?

06:42.102 --> 06:43.668
Uh, it would be one thing

06:43.670 --> 06:46.438
If you were going to ask
to use my jet or my yacht,

06:46.440 --> 06:48.907
But this is a major organ
we're talking about,

06:48.909 --> 06:50.876
One I've grown quite fond of.

06:50.878 --> 06:52.644
I know it's a big favor.

06:52.646 --> 06:55.514
That's why I'm only asking
my closest friends.

06:55.516 --> 06:58.717
Now might be a good time to
point out, we're <i>not</i> that close.

06:58.719 --> 07:01.820
But don't you remember
the bermans' christmas party?

07:01.822 --> 07:04.423
We talked in the corner
the whole night.

07:04.425 --> 07:06.992
You said we had
an amazing connection.

07:06.994 --> 07:09.694
Honestly, I was hitting on you.

07:09.696 --> 07:11.997
No.
Oh, yes.
I'm very skeevy.

07:11.999 --> 07:14.099
Well, it was a long time ago.

07:14.101 --> 07:16.101
I'm willing to forgive you.

07:16.103 --> 07:17.736
That seems misguided.

07:17.738 --> 07:19.104
I have no choice.

07:19.106 --> 07:21.706
My condition's getting worse.

07:21.708 --> 07:23.074
Please help me.

07:23.076 --> 07:25.010
I'm sorry.

07:25.012 --> 07:27.746
But if there was anything else
I could do for you...

07:27.748 --> 07:31.917
Well I would like
to get away for the weekend.

07:33.086 --> 07:34.820
Could you loan me your yacht?

07:34.822 --> 07:36.855
Oh, sweetheart.

07:36.857 --> 07:38.190
No.

07:44.130 --> 07:45.997
Miguel.

07:45.999 --> 07:48.700
I need to talk to you.

07:50.169 --> 07:52.204
In, <i>papito.</i>

07:52.206 --> 07:55.807
Now, this is very serious.

07:55.809 --> 07:57.776
Mr. Kenneth
is in trouble.

07:57.778 --> 08:00.111
Someone is stealing from him.

08:00.113 --> 08:01.813
His treasure?

08:01.815 --> 08:03.648
Yes.

08:03.650 --> 08:06.485
Someone is stealing
his treasure...

08:06.487 --> 08:09.154
A bad man...
and I need to stop him.

08:09.156 --> 08:11.156
The problem is,

08:11.158 --> 08:14.593
This bad man will be angry.

08:14.595 --> 08:17.562
He may try
to send us back to mexico.

08:17.564 --> 08:18.630
No.

08:18.632 --> 08:19.764
Yes.

08:19.766 --> 08:22.000
Sometimes in life,

08:22.002 --> 08:26.071
We have to choose between
what is good for us

08:26.073 --> 08:28.640
And what is
the right thing to do.

08:28.642 --> 08:31.276
Do you understand?

08:31.278 --> 08:33.278
And I know
how much you want to stay

08:33.280 --> 08:35.514
In this country

08:35.515 --> 08:37.582
So I am asking
for your permission.

08:38.951 --> 08:42.287
Will you let me
fight this very bad man?

08:48.594 --> 08:51.196
You will need a sword.

09:02.942 --> 09:04.676
What's going on?

09:04.678 --> 09:06.244
Oh, the cops are
breaking into ethan's locker.

09:06.246 --> 09:07.812
They've got a warrant
and everything.

09:07.814 --> 09:09.314
A warrant?

09:10.716 --> 09:12.984
Yeah, people are saying he was a
part of that home-invasion ring.

09:12.986 --> 09:14.753
Oh, my god.

09:14.755 --> 09:16.121
Wow.
That's messed up.

09:16.123 --> 09:17.656
Yeah,
they're talking to kids now,

09:17.658 --> 09:19.224
Trying to figure out
who else was part of it.

09:19.226 --> 09:21.293
You guys knew ethan, right?

09:23.229 --> 09:24.829
Not really.
We should bounce.

09:24.831 --> 09:26.565
We're gonna be late
for chemistry.

09:26.567 --> 09:29.200
This is bad.
What if carmen finds out?

09:29.202 --> 09:31.836
Who the hell is carmen?
That girl
I told you about.

09:31.838 --> 09:34.105
Don't worry about her.
Worry about going to jail.

09:34.107 --> 09:35.674
I know. I know.

09:35.676 --> 09:36.975
God, we just...
we got to come up with a plan.

09:36.977 --> 09:40.312
Well, until we do,
stay cool, okay?

09:46.319 --> 09:49.254
Hey, spence.
How are you?

09:49.256 --> 09:51.222
How's rehab going?

09:51.224 --> 09:53.625
Aww, that's great.

09:53.627 --> 09:54.859
Me?

09:54.861 --> 09:56.595
I'm so busy.

09:56.597 --> 09:59.931
You know, sweeping and mopping
and... Polishing.

10:01.201 --> 10:02.901
There's the door.
I should go.

10:02.903 --> 10:04.803
Listen,
keep up the good work, okay?

10:04.805 --> 10:06.037
Bye!

10:11.277 --> 10:12.777
Hi.

10:12.779 --> 10:14.145
This is spence westmore's
house, right?

10:14.147 --> 10:16.281
Who are you, and what is that?

10:16.283 --> 10:18.783
I'm gavin... peri westmore's
personal assistant.

10:18.785 --> 10:19.918
And this is her son.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.686
Do you know where spence is?

10:21.688 --> 10:23.288
He's at re...

10:23.290 --> 10:25.857
Rehearsal for a show.

10:25.859 --> 10:28.093
I thought the baby
was with peri in rome.

10:28.095 --> 10:29.728
Well, he was,

10:29.730 --> 10:31.262
But peri's nanny got arrested
for shoplifting.

10:31.264 --> 10:33.098
Really?
If you knew
what peri paid us,

10:33.100 --> 10:34.766
You wouldn't be that shocked.

10:34.768 --> 10:36.334
Uh, long story short,
the movie wraps in a week,

10:36.336 --> 10:38.770
And until then, peri needs
spence to take care of the baby.

10:38.772 --> 10:40.005
Oh, no, no, no, no.

10:40.007 --> 10:42.307
Spence isn't here,
and I hate kids.

10:42.309 --> 10:44.209
Oh, you don't have to love him.
Just keep him alive.

10:44.211 --> 10:45.410
I can't promise that.

10:45.412 --> 10:46.745
Lady, please.

10:46.747 --> 10:48.747
Peri's got some nerve.

10:48.749 --> 10:51.182
Didn't she just sue
for custody of tucker?

10:51.184 --> 10:53.084
Well, she says
if spence does this for her,

10:53.086 --> 10:55.420
She's willing to reconsider
the entire custody ruling.

10:56.922 --> 10:58.890
Oh.

10:58.892 --> 11:02.927
Well... I guess I could watch him
until spence gets back.

11:02.929 --> 11:04.663
I'm sure you'll do
a wonderful job.

11:04.665 --> 11:05.697
Hey.

11:05.699 --> 11:07.899
Where's his cage?
Cage?

11:07.901 --> 11:10.068
You know,
the thing you keep children in

11:10.070 --> 11:11.336
So they can't get away.

11:11.338 --> 11:12.937
You mean his playpen?

11:12.939 --> 11:15.040
Yes. Yes.
I'll need one of those.

11:15.042 --> 11:16.374
I'll have one delivered.

11:16.376 --> 11:18.009
Good luck.
Thanks.

11:18.011 --> 11:20.311
I was talking to the baby.

11:29.722 --> 11:30.955
We have to get rid
of everything.

11:30.957 --> 11:32.057
What? Do you mean,
like, the guns?

11:32.059 --> 11:33.324
The guns, the masks, the van...

11:33.326 --> 11:35.060
Anything that ties us
to the robberies.

11:35.062 --> 11:36.795
Look, let's not just panic.

11:36.797 --> 11:38.930
Okay, the cops
haven't arrested ethan.

11:38.932 --> 11:40.799
Damn it!
Why isn't he texting me back?

11:42.102 --> 11:44.135
You can forget about that.
Ethan took off.

11:44.137 --> 11:46.137
Took off? Why?

11:46.139 --> 11:48.173
Valentina knows
about the robberies.

11:48.175 --> 11:49.441
He told his girlfriend?

11:49.443 --> 11:50.775
She figured it out.

11:50.777 --> 11:52.110
Did she go to the police?

11:52.112 --> 11:54.179
Who knows?

11:54.181 --> 11:56.815
If ethan told her about us,
we're dead.

11:56.817 --> 11:59.017
I'm starting to think
it's time we all get
the hell out of dodge.

11:59.019 --> 12:01.352
If valentina doesn't know
that we're involved

12:01.354 --> 12:03.822
And if ethan is in the wind...

12:03.824 --> 12:06.091
There are a lot of "ifs"
in that sentence.

12:06.093 --> 12:09.861
Guys, let me just talk
to valentina.

12:09.863 --> 12:13.431
Then we'll know for sure
what we have to do.

12:16.335 --> 12:18.236
Rosie!

12:18.238 --> 12:20.371
Thank god you're here!

12:20.373 --> 12:23.007
I came as soon as I could.
What's wrong?

12:23.009 --> 12:24.876
I don't think
I can do this anymore.

12:24.878 --> 12:26.411
You have to get him out of here.

12:26.413 --> 12:28.780
Who are you talking about?

12:28.782 --> 12:29.848
Him!

12:31.117 --> 12:34.219
Is that tucker westmore?

12:34.221 --> 12:37.522
You call him tucker.
I call him <i>el diablo!</i>

12:37.524 --> 12:39.324
Why?

12:39.326 --> 12:40.925
He's been here two hours,

12:40.927 --> 12:43.128
And he's already broken a lamp,
spit on my shoe,

12:43.130 --> 12:45.363
And what he did to that diaper
was pure evil!

12:46.999 --> 12:50.268
Eh, don't pretend to be cute
just because she's here.

12:50.270 --> 12:53.505
Carmen, why did you call me?

12:55.207 --> 12:56.307
I need you to take him.

12:56.309 --> 12:57.942
What?!

12:57.944 --> 13:01.379
Kids drive me crazy...
all the drooling and the crying.

13:01.381 --> 13:03.114
And this one has been
trying to talk,

13:03.116 --> 13:04.382
But who can understand him?

13:04.384 --> 13:06.151
His diction is worse than mine.

13:06.153 --> 13:08.286
I would love to babysit tucker,
but I can't.

13:08.288 --> 13:10.288
I have an important meeting.

13:10.290 --> 13:13.124
Seriously?
I'm not doing so well.

13:13.126 --> 13:16.127
I'll take him as soon as I can.
I promise.

13:16.129 --> 13:17.228
I'll call you.

13:17.230 --> 13:19.164
Thank you.

13:19.166 --> 13:21.232
I'm sorry
that I'm acting like this,

13:21.234 --> 13:23.134
But ever since tucker got here,

13:23.136 --> 13:25.270
I've been moody and tired
and crabby.

13:26.506 --> 13:28.439
Why are you smiling?

13:28.441 --> 13:32.577
'cause now you know
what it's like to be a mother.

13:47.159 --> 13:48.560
Hey!

13:48.562 --> 13:50.328
Did you come by
for a little visit?

13:50.330 --> 13:52.530
I came to congratulate you.

13:52.532 --> 13:55.333
Dad says you two are
getting back together.

13:57.137 --> 13:59.571
Obviously,
your father's confused.

13:59.573 --> 14:03.041
Mm. Well, maybe that's because
you slept with him!

14:03.043 --> 14:04.142
Okay!

14:04.144 --> 14:05.944
Calm down.

14:05.946 --> 14:07.478
Your father and I
are still married,

14:07.480 --> 14:09.180
So from
the church's perspective...

14:09.182 --> 14:10.882
Don't go all catholic on me

14:10.884 --> 14:13.218
Because I will call the pope
and tell him about javier.

14:13.220 --> 14:15.954
Is this what they taught you
in catechism... blackmail?

14:15.956 --> 14:18.256
Look, if you don't want
<i>papi</i> back,

14:18.258 --> 14:19.924
You have to tell him.

14:19.926 --> 14:21.860
That's the problem.
I'm not sure!
<i>Ay, mami!</i>

14:21.862 --> 14:24.195
Last night opened up
a lot of old feelings,

14:24.197 --> 14:27.065
And it's gonna take me a while
to sort through them.

14:27.067 --> 14:28.433
Well, while you're sorting,

14:28.435 --> 14:30.501
You need to tell javier
what you did

14:30.503 --> 14:32.170
And beg his forgiveness.

14:32.172 --> 14:34.505
He won't have to forgive me
if he never finds out,

14:34.507 --> 14:36.941
And my logic
is pretty sound on that.

14:36.943 --> 14:40.979
Did it hurt when you found out
dad was seeing helen

14:40.981 --> 14:42.914
Before he broke up with you?

14:45.217 --> 14:46.284
Yeah.

14:46.286 --> 14:47.585
Then guess what...

14:47.587 --> 14:50.521
You're doing
the same thing to javier,

14:50.523 --> 14:52.991
Which means
you're no better than dad.

14:52.993 --> 14:55.627
This is, like,
the worst visit ever.

14:55.629 --> 14:58.563
Please tell javier
what's going on.

14:58.565 --> 15:00.832
It's the right thing to do.

15:02.534 --> 15:04.502
Why did I raise you so well?

15:11.344 --> 15:14.312
Miss lucinda, you came.

15:14.314 --> 15:15.513
I don't know why

15:15.515 --> 15:17.515
After the way you stabbed me
in the back.

15:17.517 --> 15:19.050
What is it you want?

15:19.052 --> 15:21.019
It wasn't me who got you
kicked out of the house.

15:21.021 --> 15:22.420
Who, then?

15:22.422 --> 15:25.156
I'll explain everything
as soon as we're all seated.

15:25.158 --> 15:26.691
What do you mean "all"?

15:26.693 --> 15:30.261
Rosie, who else is coming?

15:30.263 --> 15:32.063
Hello, chubbs.

15:32.065 --> 15:33.564
Hey, syphilis.

15:33.566 --> 15:35.033
Hold on, you two.

15:35.035 --> 15:36.501
Shouldn't you be
at the nursing home

15:36.503 --> 15:38.036
Looking for a new husband?

15:38.038 --> 15:39.437
Shouldn't you be
cutting the line

15:39.439 --> 15:40.705
At an
all-you-can-eat buffet?!

15:40.707 --> 15:42.140
Stop it!

15:42.142 --> 15:44.642
You two can't be fighting now.

15:44.644 --> 15:48.446
Mr. Kenneth is in trouble,
and he needs you.

15:48.448 --> 15:50.348
What's happened?

15:50.350 --> 15:53.384
He's in the hospital,
and reggie put him there.

15:53.386 --> 15:54.719
What do you mean?

15:54.721 --> 15:56.421
I'll tell you,

15:56.423 --> 15:59.424
But only if you both promise
to behave, all right?

16:22.581 --> 16:24.482
What are you doing in here?

16:24.484 --> 16:27.018
Oh, you scared me!

16:27.020 --> 16:29.087
Good.
I'm dolores.

16:29.089 --> 16:31.222
I'm the landlady,
and this is not your apartment.

16:31.224 --> 16:33.524
I'm marisol, a friend of opal's.

16:33.526 --> 16:35.526
I don't know if you heard...

16:35.528 --> 16:38.463
Yeah, I heard.
Cops said she shot herself.

16:38.465 --> 16:39.764
In my home.

16:39.766 --> 16:41.366
Oh, honey.

16:41.368 --> 16:44.402
Well, I'm glad she didn't
blow her brains out here.

16:44.404 --> 16:46.104
Try renting that apartment.

16:46.106 --> 16:49.240
What an...
Interesting point.

16:49.242 --> 16:51.242
So, how did you get in here?

16:51.244 --> 16:53.644
Opal's keys, uh,
were in her purse.

16:53.646 --> 16:56.514
Oh, you better return those.
Copies are expensive.

16:56.516 --> 16:58.282
Don't let these clothes
fool you.

16:58.284 --> 16:59.350
I'm not made of money.

16:59.352 --> 17:01.419
Sure.
As soon as I'm done.

17:01.421 --> 17:03.721
You're not here to take her
stuff, are you?

17:03.723 --> 17:06.523
'cause it's a bit early
to be picking the bones clean.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.459
No, I'm not interested
in opal's things.

17:08.461 --> 17:11.128
Not even that vase?
It looks expensive.

17:11.131 --> 17:12.797
No.

17:12.799 --> 17:16.099
Just so you know,
I collect vases.

17:16.102 --> 17:18.603
It was lovely to meet you,
dolores.

17:18.605 --> 17:22.406
And I will get you those keys
just as soon as I am done.

17:22.409 --> 17:23.741
Yeah, but I...
take care.

17:32.651 --> 17:36.621
So, what is this important thing
you wanted to talk about?

17:36.623 --> 17:39.157
I wanted to talk about...

17:39.159 --> 17:41.392
Us.

17:41.394 --> 17:43.294
My favorite subject.

17:44.730 --> 17:47.765
I think that one of the reasons
we work so well together

17:47.767 --> 17:50.802
Is because we're always honest,

17:50.804 --> 17:52.637
We don't keep secrets.

17:54.506 --> 17:55.673
Oh, no.

17:55.675 --> 17:57.175
Yeah.

17:57.177 --> 17:58.509
So...

17:58.511 --> 18:00.311
Damn it.

18:00.313 --> 18:02.447
She told you,
didn't she?
Hmm?

18:02.449 --> 18:04.482
I knew genevieve couldn't
keep her mouth shut,

18:04.484 --> 18:06.717
But I needed to make sure
you could get the time off.

18:06.719 --> 18:08.586
I didn't want to buy
two tickets to paris

18:08.588 --> 18:10.288
And then find out
you couldn't go.

18:10.290 --> 18:12.723
Oh, my god.
We're going to paris?

18:12.725 --> 18:15.426
Isn't that the secret you
wanted to talk about?

18:16.762 --> 18:17.762
Yes.

18:17.764 --> 18:19.597
Yes, it is.

18:19.599 --> 18:21.532
Then why do you sound
so surprised?

18:21.534 --> 18:23.568
I'm not surprised.
I'm excited!

18:23.570 --> 18:25.670
Oh, my god.
We're going to paris!

18:25.672 --> 18:27.405
You said you've never been

18:27.407 --> 18:28.806
And that you always
wanted to see it.

18:28.808 --> 18:31.576
When did I say that?

18:31.578 --> 18:33.311
Our third date...

18:33.313 --> 18:35.746
At that little bistro
in santa monica.

18:35.748 --> 18:38.216
You remember that?

18:39.551 --> 18:41.619
Hey.

18:41.621 --> 18:42.753
You okay?

18:42.755 --> 18:45.890
Sure. I'm...

18:45.892 --> 18:50.228
I'm just very happy.

18:50.230 --> 18:53.197
Happier than I deserve to be.

18:53.199 --> 18:55.800
So, you're not mad at me
for trying to surprise you?

18:55.802 --> 18:57.368
No.

18:57.370 --> 19:01.105
There are some things
that should be kept secret.

19:19.691 --> 19:20.858
Marisol.

19:20.860 --> 19:23.561
Nick. Hi.

19:23.563 --> 19:27.532
I was just, um,
looking for something.

19:27.534 --> 19:29.634
Judging by the condition
of the room,

19:29.636 --> 19:31.335
I guess you didn't find it.

19:31.337 --> 19:33.337
I wasn't sure
what I was looking for.

19:33.339 --> 19:35.306
How's that?

19:38.277 --> 19:40.678
I'm searching for evidence.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.413
You know, that thing

19:42.415 --> 19:45.816
That proves you did
whatever it was you did.

19:45.818 --> 19:48.653
And you didn't find it?

19:48.655 --> 19:50.488
No.

19:50.490 --> 19:53.391
And thanks for not
denying its existence.

19:53.393 --> 19:57.195
For the sake of argument,

19:57.197 --> 20:00.698
Uh, let's say I did
something... A long time ago,

20:00.700 --> 20:02.433
Something that was wrong.

20:02.435 --> 20:04.702
Yeah, let's say that.

20:04.704 --> 20:08.339
And if it was an accident,
something I've shed tears over,

20:08.341 --> 20:10.675
Would that change
your opinion of me?

20:10.677 --> 20:13.578
What am I supposed to say?

20:13.580 --> 20:14.946
Say you'll forgive me.

20:14.948 --> 20:18.249
You don't get absolution
before the confession.

20:18.251 --> 20:20.818
It'd be easier to confess
to someone who still loved me.

20:20.820 --> 20:24.422
I don't know how I feel
about you anymore

20:24.424 --> 20:29.260
Because... I don't know
who you are.

20:29.262 --> 20:31.329
Well...

20:33.498 --> 20:35.566
...At least
you're honest.

20:41.774 --> 20:43.774
Whatever opal had on you...

20:45.877 --> 20:48.679
...I'm going to find it.

20:50.016 --> 20:52.283
You'll wish you hadn't.

20:57.757 --> 20:59.590
Yeah. Hi.
This is carmen luna.

20:59.592 --> 21:01.759
I got your message
about the audition.

21:01.761 --> 21:04.962
Is it possible
that I go in tomorrow instead?

21:04.964 --> 21:07.865
I have some...
Child-care issues.

21:09.868 --> 21:12.603
Okay, no, no, no.
I don't want to cancel.

21:12.605 --> 21:14.805
I'll be there in an hour, then.

21:14.807 --> 21:16.674
Okay, thanks.

21:18.544 --> 21:19.977
Hey, diablo.

21:21.647 --> 21:24.048
How am I supposed to take you
to an audition?

21:41.466 --> 21:42.867
Stay.

21:42.869 --> 21:44.402
Hey.

21:44.404 --> 21:46.337
Did you just audition
for the salsa commercial?

21:46.339 --> 21:47.405
Yeah.

21:47.407 --> 21:48.606
I think I nailed it.

21:48.608 --> 21:49.740
Good for you.

21:49.742 --> 21:51.442
Listen, could you do me a favor

21:51.444 --> 21:53.511
And watch my kid
for five minutes?

21:53.513 --> 21:55.646
Are you auditioning,
too?
I am.

21:55.648 --> 21:57.081
Then no.

21:58.884 --> 22:00.551
Are you carmen luna?

22:00.553 --> 22:02.086
Yeah.

22:02.088 --> 22:04.588
You're late.
Let's go.

22:12.564 --> 22:14.332
Thank you for this opportunity.

22:14.334 --> 22:16.567
I am very excited.
Great.

22:16.569 --> 22:17.835
Why don't you slate first,

22:17.837 --> 22:19.470
And then we'll take it
from the top.

22:19.472 --> 22:20.705
Whenever you're ready.

22:21.707 --> 22:23.941
Hi. I'm carmen luna,

22:23.943 --> 22:27.645
And I am auditioning
for the rosada salsa jingle.

22:32.919 --> 22:35.786
♪ On a chip, on some eggs

22:35.788 --> 22:38.456
♪ add some zip, give it legs

22:38.458 --> 22:40.891
♪ rosada

22:40.893 --> 22:44.729

22:50.370 --> 22:52.470

hold on!

22:55.808 --> 22:58.576
♪ Salsa stop!

22:58.578 --> 23:00.511
Is that a baby crying?

23:00.513 --> 23:02.113
Oh, it's okay.
He's fine.

23:02.115 --> 23:03.481
That's <i>your</i> kid?

23:03.483 --> 23:04.648
Mm-hmm.

23:04.650 --> 23:06.450
Who's watching him?

23:06.452 --> 23:09.653
Well, he's very independent.

23:15.395 --> 23:18.662
What kind of monster are you?

23:18.664 --> 23:21.065
A talented one?

23:30.409 --> 23:32.076
How's he doing?

23:32.078 --> 23:35.012
Wonderful,
but he's getting sleepy.

23:35.014 --> 23:36.814
Oh, <i>n</i> you're getting sleepy?

23:36.816 --> 23:39.617
You couldn't you take a nap
yesterday, you audition killer?

23:40.853 --> 23:43.120
I still can't believe
you tied him up.

23:43.122 --> 23:45.689
What? I-I was desperate,
all right?

23:45.691 --> 23:47.425
That's why I needed
your help, rosie.

23:47.427 --> 23:49.059
I can't deal with kids.

23:49.061 --> 23:52.029
You'll get the hang of it
once you have kids of your own.

23:53.132 --> 23:55.032
Please.
I'm never having kids.

23:55.034 --> 23:57.802
How can you say that?
'cause I don't want them.

23:57.804 --> 23:59.570
I have a career to worry about.

23:59.572 --> 24:02.973
Well, I don't get that,
but... Okay.

24:02.975 --> 24:05.576
You're like every other woman
that has kids, you know?

24:05.578 --> 24:07.578
They find out that I don't have
the "mom gene,"

24:07.580 --> 24:08.746
And they look down on me.

24:08.748 --> 24:10.648
I don't mean to insult you.

24:10.650 --> 24:12.850
It's just...
I love having a child.

24:12.852 --> 24:14.985
Miguel makes me very happy.

24:14.987 --> 24:16.921
You know what I love having?

24:16.923 --> 24:18.189
A dream.

24:18.191 --> 24:19.924
And the day my dream comes true,

24:19.926 --> 24:21.725
I'm gonna be as happy
as you are.

24:21.727 --> 24:23.160
What if it doesn't come true?

24:23.162 --> 24:24.829
What?

24:24.831 --> 24:26.630
Well, lots of people have dreams
that don't work out,

24:26.632 --> 24:30.034
Or they get their dream
and then it goes wrong.

24:30.036 --> 24:31.669
That's not gonna happen to me.

24:31.671 --> 24:33.671
But what if it does?

24:33.673 --> 24:37.141
Won't you need something else
in your life,

24:37.143 --> 24:39.944
Something that'll give you joy?

24:39.946 --> 24:42.746
My dream is gonna come true.

24:42.748 --> 24:45.082
How can you be so sure?

24:46.785 --> 24:48.686
It just has to.

24:58.897 --> 25:01.065
Zoila!

25:01.067 --> 25:02.666
Did you talk to javier?

25:02.668 --> 25:05.202
Did he have
anything interesting to say?

25:05.204 --> 25:07.705
Yeah, he told me about the trip.

25:07.707 --> 25:09.139
Have you been crying?

25:09.141 --> 25:10.508
Just a little.

25:10.510 --> 25:14.678
Oh, zoila,
you're gonna love paris.

25:14.680 --> 25:16.213
Forget paris.
What's wrong?

25:17.849 --> 25:20.784
I haven't had any luck
finding a donor,

25:20.786 --> 25:24.255
And the doctor says I'm gonna
need a kidney very soon.

25:24.257 --> 25:26.290
Oh, honey.

25:26.292 --> 25:28.259
And it hit me...

25:28.261 --> 25:31.862
One of these days,
I could actually die.

25:31.864 --> 25:33.864
That never occurred to you?

25:33.866 --> 25:37.535
I guess I didn't
think it through.

25:37.537 --> 25:39.870
Oh, I don't want to die
just yet,

25:39.872 --> 25:42.072
Not while I still look so good.

25:42.074 --> 25:44.275
I've got an idea.

25:44.277 --> 25:47.278
Why not let me get tested?

25:47.280 --> 25:48.846
Zoila, no.

25:48.848 --> 25:51.181
You asked every other friend
you have.

25:51.183 --> 25:52.750
But you work for me.

25:52.752 --> 25:55.286
I wouldn't want you
to feel I'm forcing you.

25:55.288 --> 25:58.322
After all these years,
do you still not get it?

26:00.058 --> 26:03.160
I'd do that for you.

26:14.139 --> 26:15.639
Hi.

26:15.641 --> 26:17.908
I left earlier
without returning your keys.

26:17.910 --> 26:19.009
I'm so sorry.

26:19.011 --> 26:20.811
Oh, don't worry about it.

26:20.813 --> 26:22.146
Come on in.

26:23.682 --> 26:26.283
So, did you find
what you were looking for?

26:26.285 --> 26:28.052
No.

26:28.054 --> 26:30.621
Do you have any extra storage
here at the building?

26:30.623 --> 26:31.922
I wish.

26:31.924 --> 26:33.891
People would pay
through the nose for that.

26:33.893 --> 26:35.359
Well, thanks anyway.

26:35.361 --> 26:38.062
Hey, this silver key isn't mine.

26:38.064 --> 26:39.330
It's not?

26:39.332 --> 26:40.898
No.

26:40.900 --> 26:44.335
It's got, uh, "beverly pacific"
stamped on it.

26:44.337 --> 26:48.339
Opal's bank.
Of course.

26:48.341 --> 26:49.673
Hey!

26:49.675 --> 26:51.275
Don't think you can go

26:51.277 --> 26:54.178
Snooping around
someone's safe-deposit box.

26:54.180 --> 26:55.946
That's illegal.

26:57.082 --> 26:59.617
Isn't that opal's vase?

26:59.619 --> 27:01.151
Lovely to meet you.

27:09.794 --> 27:11.695
Who are you?

27:11.697 --> 27:14.064
Her name is esperanza.

27:14.066 --> 27:15.833
She's your new maid.

27:15.835 --> 27:17.267
My new maid?

27:17.269 --> 27:19.370
<i>Hola. ¿cómo está?</i>

27:19.372 --> 27:22.206
I called the agency,
they sent her over.

27:22.208 --> 27:24.375
I didn't realize
you'd be leaving so soon.

27:24.377 --> 27:26.110
You won't miss me.

27:26.112 --> 27:28.846
She's very good at her job.

27:28.848 --> 27:30.114
I trust you'll keep quiet

27:33.251 --> 27:37.087
When I came here, I saw
how broken this family was.

27:37.089 --> 27:39.857
I thought I could help
put it back together.

27:39.859 --> 27:42.860
But mrs. Didi and miss lucinda
don't care about mr. Kenneth,

27:42.862 --> 27:45.262
And he seems ready to die.

27:45.264 --> 27:47.264
So, take all his money.

27:47.266 --> 27:49.733
There is nothing I can do
to stop you.

27:49.735 --> 27:52.269
You make me sound so evil.

27:52.271 --> 27:55.406
I don't know the english word
for what you are.

27:55.408 --> 27:59.276
All I ask is that you don't mess
with my immigration.

27:59.278 --> 28:01.879
I want my son to grow up
in this country.

28:01.881 --> 28:05.849
And you'll keep quiet about
my... Creative accounting?

28:05.851 --> 28:08.352
I will.

28:08.354 --> 28:09.820
Oh, and, uh...

28:12.724 --> 28:15.292
...I don't want this.

28:15.294 --> 28:17.094
Keep it...

28:17.096 --> 28:20.164
As a reminder of what your life
could have been like.

28:29.174 --> 28:31.008
Well?

28:31.010 --> 28:33.143
He's so dumb.

28:34.780 --> 28:36.780
Let's do this.

28:38.217 --> 28:42.119
Okay, uh, give me 10 minutes.
I'll be right over.

28:43.855 --> 28:45.355
Was that the hospital?

28:45.357 --> 28:47.157
Some of the people that
promised mom they'd get tested

28:47.159 --> 28:48.358
Didn't show up.

28:48.360 --> 28:50.360
I have to go see
what's going on.

28:50.362 --> 28:51.862
Do what you need to.

28:53.733 --> 28:56.266
You know, it really helps a lot
knowing you're here.

28:56.268 --> 28:58.936
I'm glad.

29:00.940 --> 29:03.207
Call me later.
Yeah.

29:11.316 --> 29:14.418
Oh!
I am really sorry!

29:14.420 --> 29:15.452
That's okay.

29:15.454 --> 29:17.054
Let me buy you another cup.

29:17.056 --> 29:18.522
Miss, when you have a second?

29:18.524 --> 29:21.091
You don't have to do that.
It's no big deal.

29:21.093 --> 29:23.093
Hey!

29:23.095 --> 29:25.863
Aren't you valentina...
ethan's girlfriend?

29:25.865 --> 29:27.431
Do I know you?

29:27.433 --> 29:30.334
I go to school with him.
He's always talking about you.

29:30.336 --> 29:32.803
He even has a picture of you
in his locker.

29:32.805 --> 29:34.505
Oh.

29:34.507 --> 29:36.774
You know...

29:36.776 --> 29:38.442
Everybody at school

29:38.444 --> 29:40.544
Is saying the cops
are looking for him.

29:40.546 --> 29:42.913
Was he really part
of that robbery ring?

29:42.915 --> 29:45.249
I don't want to talk about it.

29:45.251 --> 29:47.351
Oh, come on.
He must have said something.

29:47.353 --> 29:49.253
You can trust me.
I won't tell anyone.

29:50.421 --> 29:53.223
Forget about the coffee.
I have to be somewhere.

29:53.225 --> 29:55.425
Geez, I'm just worried
about him.

29:55.427 --> 29:57.060
That's all.

29:57.062 --> 29:59.396
I hope you're not gonna
say anything to the cops.

29:59.398 --> 30:01.398
E-excuse me?

30:01.400 --> 30:04.401
He could go to jail,
along with those other guys.

30:04.403 --> 30:06.870
You'd ruin
a lot of people's lives.

30:08.439 --> 30:10.274
Since you asked,

30:10.276 --> 30:13.277
I already told the police
everything I know.

30:13.279 --> 30:15.379
You did?

30:15.381 --> 30:18.816
I'm sorry.
I didn't catch your name.

30:20.151 --> 30:21.251
Forget it.

30:21.253 --> 30:23.153
Sorry to bother you.

30:32.864 --> 30:34.164
Hey!

30:34.166 --> 30:36.333
I told you
you're not allowed up here.

30:36.335 --> 30:39.102
You said only family
could visit.

30:39.104 --> 30:41.471
Well, this is
mr. Kenneth's family.

30:41.473 --> 30:43.373
I'm lucinda, his daughter,

30:43.375 --> 30:45.342
And this is
my father's wife, didi.

30:45.344 --> 30:47.211
We're taking him home.

30:47.213 --> 30:48.545
Not without authorization,
you're not.

30:48.547 --> 30:50.480
I'm calling reggie.

30:50.482 --> 30:54.084
Just tell me one thing.
How much is he paying you?

30:56.354 --> 30:59.590
It's okay.
We're prepared to negotiate.

31:11.469 --> 31:15.172
Rosie's told us everything.

31:15.174 --> 31:17.608
We've come back to help you.

31:17.610 --> 31:21.578
I c-can't believe it.

31:21.580 --> 31:24.381
After the way
I've treated you both?

31:27.252 --> 31:31.121
That's the first thing
you learn in a family...

31:31.123 --> 31:33.123
How to forgive.

31:39.965 --> 31:41.899
Thank you.

31:49.941 --> 31:52.009
Thank you for your help.

31:52.011 --> 31:54.077
Oh, no. Thank <i>you.</i>

32:04.389 --> 32:06.590
Sorry I'm late.

32:06.592 --> 32:08.558
It's fine.
I let myself in.

32:08.560 --> 32:11.094
I was at the hospital
getting tested.

32:11.096 --> 32:13.497
I don't know if you heard
about genevieve.
I have.

32:13.499 --> 32:15.699
So, you'd really give her
one of your kidneys?

32:15.701 --> 32:18.568
Sure, if I'm a match,
which is doubtful,

32:18.570 --> 32:20.971
But you know
how I feel about her.

32:23.574 --> 32:25.709
What are those for?

32:25.711 --> 32:27.244
The other night.

32:27.246 --> 32:30.447
Yeah, about that...

32:30.449 --> 32:34.518
Come on, you can't tell me
you didn't have a great time,

32:34.520 --> 32:36.119
'cause I was there.

32:36.121 --> 32:37.487
I heard you.
Yeah, well...

32:37.489 --> 32:39.523
hell, the neighbors heard you.

32:39.525 --> 32:42.059
Okay!
We had some fun.

32:42.061 --> 32:44.061
Please don't read
too much into it.

32:44.063 --> 32:47.197
You don't want to take me back?

32:47.199 --> 32:49.466
I don't think so.

32:49.468 --> 32:51.735
But I just broke up with helen.

32:51.737 --> 32:54.071
I'm sorry.

32:54.073 --> 32:56.340
Zoila, I messed up.
I admit that.

32:56.342 --> 32:58.608
But if I had
any doubts about us,

32:58.610 --> 33:01.011
The other night took them away.

33:01.013 --> 33:03.580
We can still be great together.

33:03.582 --> 33:06.049
You know what my problem is?

33:06.051 --> 33:09.219
I don't forget so easy.

33:09.221 --> 33:12.489
Then focus on the good times.
There were a lot of them.

33:12.491 --> 33:14.124
Believe me.

33:14.126 --> 33:16.159
I don't want to throw out
20 years' worth of memories.

33:16.161 --> 33:19.029
But when I think
about what you did to me,

33:19.031 --> 33:21.031
How can I trust you?

33:21.033 --> 33:23.367
So, you'd rather be with javier?

33:23.369 --> 33:24.768
Maybe.

33:24.770 --> 33:27.237
I don't know.

33:28.573 --> 33:30.107
Look, look.

33:30.109 --> 33:31.708
Look, look, look!
I'll do whatever you want.

33:31.710 --> 33:33.377
I'll get on my knees.

33:33.379 --> 33:36.179
I'll make some grand,
romantic gesture.

33:36.181 --> 33:39.049
Just please, zoila,
don't shut the door.

33:39.051 --> 33:42.285
I think I'll be
out of town next week.

33:42.287 --> 33:45.355
Let's talk about it after.

33:53.232 --> 33:55.265
What... what do you mean,
you lost him?!

33:55.267 --> 33:57.367
H-he's a 65-year-old
stroke victim.

33:57.369 --> 33:58.702
He couldn't just walk out!

33:58.704 --> 34:00.570
Someone must have taken him.

34:04.409 --> 34:07.077
I need to call you back.

34:09.213 --> 34:11.614
You have five seconds
to tell me where my uncle is.

34:11.617 --> 34:12.681
I mean it, rosie!

34:12.684 --> 34:14.117
If you don't tell me,

34:14.119 --> 34:15.652
I will call the cops.

34:15.654 --> 34:17.687
Good...

34:17.688 --> 34:20.757
Since we were gonna
call them anyway.

34:21.793 --> 34:24.161
Uncle ken, I've...
I've been so worried.

34:24.163 --> 34:26.295
You can relax now.

34:26.297 --> 34:28.297
We've been taking
good care of him.

34:28.300 --> 34:30.233
You shouldn't have taken him
out of the hospital.

34:30.235 --> 34:31.568
I'm his legal guardian.

34:31.570 --> 34:33.503
Not anymore, you're not.

34:33.505 --> 34:36.373
Mr. Kenneth has taken back
his power of attorney.

34:36.375 --> 34:38.574
And that's allowed us
to investigate.

34:38.577 --> 34:40.844
We know what you've
been up to, reggie.

34:40.846 --> 34:44.281
I was shocked,
and I used to be a stripper.

34:44.283 --> 34:46.817
N-none of you
are making any sense.

34:46.819 --> 34:48.717
We have proof, reggie,

34:48.719 --> 34:51.855
Which we got off the files
on your computer.

34:51.857 --> 34:53.723
My computer
hasn't left this house.

34:53.725 --> 34:56.092
And that gave me a lot of time
to go through it,

34:56.094 --> 34:57.194
So thank you.

34:58.729 --> 35:01.731
Esperanza is actually a

35:01.733 --> 35:03.834
What is the english word?

35:03.836 --> 35:05.702
Forensic accountant.

35:05.704 --> 35:08.338
And she's been going
over the mess you've
made of kenny's estate.

35:08.340 --> 35:11.708
So, we know you've
been stealing from
daddy hand over fist.

35:11.710 --> 35:13.343
That's a lie.

35:13.345 --> 35:15.645
Mr. Miller, I have statements
from all your accounts,

35:15.647 --> 35:17.814
Even the ones
in the cayman islands.

35:19.617 --> 35:22.586
I told you
she was good at her job.

35:25.723 --> 35:28.625
This is all
a big misunderstanding.

35:28.627 --> 35:31.695
I did move some money around,
but I was investing it...

35:31.697 --> 35:34.231
For you...
for the family.

35:34.233 --> 35:36.600
You shouldn't use that word,

35:36.602 --> 35:39.569
Since you don't know
what it means.

35:39.571 --> 35:42.172
We'll understand if you want to
get the hell out of here.

35:42.174 --> 35:45.775
Don't worry.
We'll be seeing you in court.

35:50.681 --> 35:53.350
You might want to
pack your bags...

35:53.352 --> 35:55.519
'cause I am gonna see to it

35:55.521 --> 35:58.321
You are thrown
out of this country.

36:11.703 --> 36:13.570
Hello?

36:15.439 --> 36:16.740
Oh. Hi, dr. Kimball.

36:16.742 --> 36:18.942
Um, she's actually resting
right now.

36:18.944 --> 36:20.744
Can I ask what this is about?

36:25.616 --> 36:27.317
Mom! Mom!
Wake up.

36:27.319 --> 36:29.419
Wake up, wake up, wake up.

36:29.421 --> 36:30.720
What is it?
I-is something wrong?

36:30.722 --> 36:32.455
No!

36:32.457 --> 36:34.257
Dr. Kimball's on the phone,
and he has amazing news.

36:34.259 --> 36:35.659
You've got to
talk to him right now.

36:37.396 --> 36:38.762
Hello, doctor.

36:38.764 --> 36:40.830
Mrs. Delatour,
sorry to bother you,

36:40.832 --> 36:43.233
But I wanted to tell you
right away...

36:43.235 --> 36:44.334
We found a donor.

36:44.336 --> 36:46.903
Are you serious?

36:48.272 --> 36:49.706
Absolutely.

36:49.708 --> 36:51.468
We confirmed the tests.
It's a perfect match.

36:52.611 --> 36:54.811
Someone is willing
to give me a kidney?

36:54.813 --> 36:56.646
Who is this angel?

36:56.648 --> 36:58.682
Actually, I think you know him.

36:58.684 --> 37:00.750
He's married to your maid.

37:04.822 --> 37:06.790
Valentina talked to the cops?

37:06.792 --> 37:08.358
What did she tell them?

37:08.360 --> 37:09.526
I couldn't ask her that.

37:09.528 --> 37:10.961
She was starting
to get suspicious.

37:10.963 --> 37:12.629
Of him?
Oh, this is great.

37:12.631 --> 37:14.764
There's no reason
to panic, okay?

37:14.766 --> 37:16.733
My dad's a lawyer.
I know this stuff.

37:16.735 --> 37:19.603
Even if we went to trial,
what would they use as evidence?

37:19.605 --> 37:21.538
Are you joking?
They know about ethan.

37:21.540 --> 37:22.839
But ethan's gone, okay?

37:22.841 --> 37:24.708
Unless the cops can tie us
to the robberies

37:24.710 --> 37:26.610
With physical evidence...

37:26.612 --> 37:28.945
Which they can't get because
we got rid of everything.

37:28.947 --> 37:31.748
So the only thing they've got
is valentina's testimony

37:31.750 --> 37:33.717
Of something her boyfriend
told her.

37:33.719 --> 37:35.719
And that wouldn't be enough
to convict us...

37:35.721 --> 37:36.987
Would it?

37:36.989 --> 37:39.823
There's only one way to be sure.

37:39.825 --> 37:41.024
What's that?

37:43.928 --> 37:47.797
We have to get rid of valentina.

37:49.333 --> 37:51.034
This is it, carmen.
I can feel it.

37:51.036 --> 37:53.436
Shh! Not so loud.
I just got the baby down.

37:53.438 --> 37:56.806
Whatever opal had on nick
is in that box.

37:56.808 --> 37:58.875
Then what are you waiting for?
Go get it.

37:58.877 --> 38:00.343
I can't.
I'm not opal.

38:00.345 --> 38:01.645
But you have the key?

38:01.647 --> 38:03.613
That's not the way
safe-deposit boxes work.

38:03.615 --> 38:05.415
The bank manager has a key, too.

38:05.417 --> 38:06.950
It takes both to open the box.

38:06.952 --> 38:08.885
Oh. Then what
are you gonna do?

38:13.324 --> 38:14.891
How good are you at makeup?

38:14.893 --> 38:16.960
Clearly, I'm fantastic.

38:16.962 --> 38:18.028
Why?

38:18.030 --> 38:21.531
Can you make me look...

38:21.533 --> 38:23.300
Like this?

39:00.638 --> 39:02.272
Good afternoon.

39:02.274 --> 39:04.774
I want to get into
my safe-deposit box, please.

39:04.776 --> 39:07.744
Okay.
I'll just need an I.D.

39:19.390 --> 39:23.059
Would you mind removing
your sunglasses, please?

39:35.473 --> 39:37.974
You know, you're
much prettier in person.

39:39.710 --> 39:42.379
Thank god you feel that way.

39:52.156 --> 39:53.390
Thank you.

39:53.392 --> 39:54.657
My pleasure.

39:54.659 --> 39:56.793
Just ring the bell
when you're done.

40:26.757 --> 40:28.925
Oh, my god.
