00:02.435 --> 00:04.164
The big new accessory
with eyeglasses...

00:05.505 --> 00:08.531
...seems to be that strap that connects
so you can take them on and off...

00:08.708 --> 00:11.871
...which I don't get because if you
have glasses, isn't that because...

00:12.045 --> 00:14.570
...you need to wear glasses?

00:14.748 --> 00:16.739
"You need glasses."
Isn't that what they say?

00:16.916 --> 00:18.349
An eye doctor doesn't say:

00:18.518 --> 00:21.009
"Would you care for some glasses?"

00:22.722 --> 00:25.782
People with crutches don't
have a chain attached to their belt...

00:25.959 --> 00:29.588
...so they can just let go
of them every now and then.

00:29.763 --> 00:32.357
Why not get a toupee with a
rubber band for water-skiing?

00:32.531 --> 00:34.432
The thing could just....

00:42.475 --> 00:43.772
Hey, George.

00:44.944 --> 00:46.571
Gary?

00:47.080 --> 00:48.445
Where the hell have you been?

00:48.615 --> 00:50.378
I've been leaving
messages for months.

00:50.550 --> 00:52.711
-I know, I've been busy.
-Don't give me busy.

00:52.886 --> 00:57.152
Who's not busy? I'm busy.
We're all busy. Everybody's busy.

00:57.323 --> 00:59.951
All right. Tell me.
What's kept you so busy?

01:00.126 --> 01:01.855
Mostly chemotherapy.

01:02.028 --> 01:03.791
Hey, I'll see you.

01:09.335 --> 01:11.326
Hey, pig!

01:16.009 --> 01:17.499
Hey, hey, hey!

01:18.311 --> 01:20.006
So you called the cop a pig?

01:20.180 --> 01:22.171
I was yelling at the litterbug.

01:22.348 --> 01:23.713
I mean, this is my town.

01:23.883 --> 01:27.011
You don't throw trash
on the streets of my town.

01:27.187 --> 01:29.087
So, didn't you explain that
to the cop?

01:29.255 --> 01:31.587
No, I fled the scene.

01:32.959 --> 01:35.393
-Hey.
-Hey.

01:36.196 --> 01:39.529
Kramer, I need to talk
to Jerry privately.

01:41.468 --> 01:43.129
What about?

01:45.605 --> 01:47.664
-Kramer.
-Oh, come on, George...

01:47.841 --> 01:49.240
...you can share it with me.

01:49.409 --> 01:51.934
-You're hurting me.
-You gonna share with me next time?

01:52.112 --> 01:56.549
-Sure. I swear.
-All right. I'm looking forward to it.

02:06.493 --> 02:08.723
All right, I got news. You ready?

02:10.729 --> 02:14.496
-Gary Fogel had cancer.
-Oh, yeah, I knew.

02:14.667 --> 02:17.659
-You knew? How did you know?
-He told me a few months ago.

02:17.837 --> 02:19.236
Why did he tell you and not me?

02:19.405 --> 02:22.966
-I don't know.
-How are you closer to him than me?

02:23.877 --> 02:26.175
-So is he okay?
-Oh, yeah, he's fine.

02:26.346 --> 02:28.280
He was in bad shape
for a while, though.

02:28.448 --> 02:30.313
Really? How bad?
Was he on his deathbed?

02:30.483 --> 02:32.747
No, he was on his regular bed.

02:33.219 --> 02:34.584
So why didn't you tell me?

02:34.754 --> 02:37.245
-He swore me to secrecy.
-So?

02:37.423 --> 02:38.754
It's not like you're my wife.

02:38.925 --> 02:40.756
I still think you should've told me.

02:40.927 --> 02:42.360
You were better off not knowing.

02:42.529 --> 02:45.191
It's not easy to deal with
someone in a situation like this.

02:45.365 --> 02:48.163
I was so nice to him l
almost made myself sick.

02:48.334 --> 02:49.926
I'm gonna talk to him about this.

02:50.103 --> 02:51.764
That's right. You let him have it.

02:51.938 --> 02:54.406
Who is he not to tell you
about his life-threatening illness?

02:54.574 --> 02:56.838
-That's what I'm saying.
-His illness is your business.

02:57.010 --> 03:00.002
-lf not mine, whose?
-lf not now, when?

03:01.214 --> 03:03.079
Were you just talking about me?

03:03.249 --> 03:05.183
No, an old friend of ours, Gary.

03:05.351 --> 03:07.114
Oh, the guy with cancer?

03:07.854 --> 03:09.947
You told her? She's not your wife.

03:10.123 --> 03:12.182
If I told you, you would've
given it away.

03:12.358 --> 03:15.794
-You don't think I can keep a secret?
-No, but he would have read your face.

03:16.396 --> 03:20.093
-You don't trust my poker face?
-Do you ever win at poker?

03:21.401 --> 03:22.959
No.

03:23.770 --> 03:27.297
Hey. Oh, I just saw your
old boyfriend on TV.

03:27.473 --> 03:29.100
-Jake Jarmel?
-Yeah.

03:29.275 --> 03:31.903
I like those glasses he was wearing.
Where'd he get those?

03:32.078 --> 03:33.943
-Why? You don't wear glasses.
-I know.

03:34.113 --> 03:35.876
But I need a new look.
I'm stagnating.

03:36.916 --> 03:40.079
I have to say, as a glasses-wearer,
I take exception to that.

03:40.253 --> 03:43.620
That's like me buying a wheelchair
to cruise around in.

03:44.290 --> 03:46.224
Yeah, I've considered that.

03:46.893 --> 03:49.327
Look, how do I get in touch
with this guy?

03:49.629 --> 03:52.393
He's having a two-day book signing
at Walden's.

03:52.565 --> 03:54.294
You know, we had
a really bad breakup.

03:54.467 --> 03:56.332
The Jujyfruits?

03:56.736 --> 03:59.102
Yeah, the Jujyfruits.

04:01.774 --> 04:03.207
Okay, K-Man.

04:03.376 --> 04:05.936
-Enjoy the book.
-Thank you. Listen, Jake...

04:06.112 --> 04:08.012
...where did you get
those eyeglass frames?

04:08.181 --> 04:10.342
-I can't tell you.
-You don't know where?

04:10.516 --> 04:13.349
Yes, I do, but I don't want
anyone else to have them.

04:13.519 --> 04:16.420
Well, that's peculiar.

04:20.059 --> 04:22.527
Oh, there's that woman that
never talks to anybody.

04:22.996 --> 04:23.985
Really?

04:24.163 --> 04:26.188
Every day she comes in and reads.

04:26.366 --> 04:27.663
Never talks to anybody.

04:27.834 --> 04:30.598
Oh, I spoke to Debby Biblow.
She said to say hi.

04:31.137 --> 04:32.263
Really?

04:33.106 --> 04:35.506
Gary, I really have to say
I'm a little bit hurt...

04:35.675 --> 04:37.802
...that you didn't decide
to confide in me.

04:37.977 --> 04:40.946
Well, frankly, you can't
keep a secret.

04:41.114 --> 04:44.709
You know, you'd get two pair,
the whole table knows.

04:44.884 --> 04:46.374
Well, I still think it was wrong.

04:46.552 --> 04:49.214
I'm sorry. All right?
I guess I was just thinking of myself.

04:49.389 --> 04:51.084
Yes.

04:52.859 --> 04:55.350
So I called the litterbug a pig.
Not you.

04:55.528 --> 04:58.190
I like policemen.
I wanted to be a policeman.

04:58.364 --> 05:00.298
Yeah, so why didn't you?

05:00.466 --> 05:02.559
I'm scared of being shot.

05:03.036 --> 05:05.664
Mr. Kramer, let me tell you a story.

05:05.838 --> 05:10.832
In 1979, I ticketed a brown Dodge
Diplomat for parking in a church zone.

05:11.010 --> 05:12.841
That fine was never paid.

05:13.012 --> 05:16.038
And since then, that scofflaw has
piled up more parking tickets...

05:16.215 --> 05:18.046
...than anyone in New York City.

05:18.217 --> 05:20.913
For 16 years I pursued him...

05:21.087 --> 05:24.181
...only to see him give me
the slip time and time again.

05:24.357 --> 05:26.655
I've never got
a clean look at his face...

05:26.826 --> 05:29.886
...but he's become my white whale.

05:30.063 --> 05:33.396
Mr. Kramer, that day was yesterday.

05:33.566 --> 05:37.764
But thanks to you, I don't know if
I'll every get that chance again.

05:38.538 --> 05:40.836
I like that eye patch.

05:43.042 --> 05:45.636
All right. I'm gonna move my car.
My meter's up.

05:46.179 --> 05:49.376
-You can't park in this city.
-Hey.

05:49.549 --> 05:51.414
George, you know that
company I work for?

05:51.584 --> 05:53.449
They own the parking lot
around the corner.

05:53.619 --> 05:57.783
-Oh, that's a Kinney lot?
-Yeah. There's a space opening and...

05:57.957 --> 06:00.152
...I could get it for you.
You'd just pay tax.

06:00.326 --> 06:02.021
It'd be, like, 50 a month.

06:02.395 --> 06:04.522
Fifty bucks a month?
That's incredible.

06:04.697 --> 06:06.028
Okay. Thanks.

06:06.199 --> 06:07.928
I got lunch, all right?

06:08.901 --> 06:10.391
Still owe me a secret.

06:12.672 --> 06:15.004
All right, there is something
I haven't told you.

06:15.174 --> 06:18.371
-Yeah?
-But you can't tell Jerry.

06:18.845 --> 06:22.941
What do you think, I tell Jerry
everything? It's not like he's my wife.

06:23.883 --> 06:25.373
Okay. Well...

06:26.185 --> 06:28.210
...the thing is I've been living a lie.

06:28.755 --> 06:31.315
Just one? I'm living, like, 20.

06:33.259 --> 06:34.487
What's yours?

06:34.660 --> 06:36.389
Well, l....

06:37.096 --> 06:39.564
I never actually had cancer.

06:39.732 --> 06:41.427
I'll see you.

06:43.836 --> 06:46.202
So he refused to tell you
where he got the glasses?

06:46.372 --> 06:47.896
Flat out refused.

06:48.074 --> 06:50.338
Yeah, isn't that just like him?

06:50.510 --> 06:52.944
You know, he has to be
the only one who has them.

06:53.112 --> 06:55.603
Yeah, tell me about it, soul sister.

06:55.782 --> 06:59.183
-Anyway, I told Jake that you said hi.
-What?

06:59.952 --> 07:02.318
-You told Jake I said hi?
-Yeah.

07:02.488 --> 07:05.252
I can't believe you did that.
Why did you tell him I said hi?

07:05.425 --> 07:07.757
I never said hi. When did I say hi?

07:07.927 --> 07:10.054
-I never heard her say hi.
-It's common courtesy.

07:10.229 --> 07:14.563
No, no, Kramer. You don't understand.
He made the last contact between us.

07:14.734 --> 07:18.636
I had the upper hand in the
post-breakup relationship.

07:19.138 --> 07:22.596
If he thinks that I said hi,
then I lose the upper hand.

07:22.775 --> 07:24.538
It's like a game of tag.

07:25.111 --> 07:26.942
-Where are you going?
-Nowhere.

07:27.113 --> 07:29.013
You're going to the bookstore
to see Jake.

07:29.182 --> 07:30.479
-So what if I do?
-Listen...

07:30.650 --> 07:34.177
...if you're going, you can get him to
tell you where he got those glasses.

07:34.353 --> 07:36.116
Elaine!

07:36.656 --> 07:38.089
Hey.

07:38.825 --> 07:42.693
-How'd it go with Gary?
-Fine. Fine.

07:44.497 --> 07:47.193
-Really?
-Yeah.

07:48.835 --> 07:53.670
-Looks like something's on your mind.
-No, nothing. I'm fine.

07:54.974 --> 07:57.534
So that's your poker face.

08:00.880 --> 08:02.848
-A regular face.
-No, it isn't.

08:03.015 --> 08:05.279
I've seen your regular face.
That is not it.

08:07.653 --> 08:09.120
What are you saying?

08:09.288 --> 08:11.756
All right, George, come on.
What do you got?

08:12.592 --> 08:15.390
-I got nothing.
-What do got? A pair of bullets?

08:16.329 --> 08:17.728
What are you talking about?

08:17.897 --> 08:19.330
Two pair? Three of a kind?

08:19.499 --> 08:23.196
-Will you stop it?
-Oh, my God. You got a flush.

08:23.603 --> 08:26.003
-You're holding a flush.
-I don't have a flush.

08:26.172 --> 08:28.902
A full house?
You got a full house?

08:29.275 --> 08:33.177
Turn them over, George. I wanna
see them. Come on. I'm calling.

08:33.346 --> 08:37.043
-What do you got?
-Gary Fogel never had cancer!

08:42.087 --> 08:45.580
So you see, Kramer took it upon
himself to say hi to you for me...

08:45.758 --> 08:48.522
...when in fact, it was
an unauthorized hi.

08:48.694 --> 08:50.855
-You didn't say hi?
-That's what I'm saying.

08:51.030 --> 08:53.021
-That's what you came to tell me?
-Correct.

08:53.199 --> 08:54.860
-You never said hi.
-Correct.

08:55.034 --> 08:57.025
-You still like me, don't you?
-Correct. What?

08:57.203 --> 08:59.763
Hey, I have been trying to get
this book signed all day.

08:59.939 --> 09:04.103
How can you say that I still like you
when I didn't even say hi to you?

09:04.277 --> 09:06.268
Coming down to say
that you didn't say hi...

09:06.445 --> 09:08.709
...is more of a gesture
than if you did say hi.

09:09.515 --> 09:11.039
Jake....

09:13.486 --> 09:15.113
The doctors thought
he had cancer...

09:15.288 --> 09:17.779
...but the surgery revealed
he never actually had it.

09:17.957 --> 09:20.016
-So, what was wrong with him?
-Nothing.

09:20.192 --> 09:21.784
He's been lying to me
for two months?

09:21.961 --> 09:24.930
-That's right.
-What kind of person is this?

09:25.097 --> 09:28.533
There's one other person who might
do something like this, and that's you.

09:29.001 --> 09:31.231
-Well....
-I don't even think you could do it.

09:31.404 --> 09:33.338
No, I could do it.

09:33.506 --> 09:36.339
-Yeah, I guess you could.
-Come on.

09:37.243 --> 09:40.337
He was so worried about losing
more hair with chemo treatments...

09:40.513 --> 09:44.313
...I bought him an unlimited gift
certificate at the Hair Team For Men...

09:44.483 --> 09:46.075
...just to put his mind at ease?

09:46.452 --> 09:47.749
-You did that?
-Yeah!

09:47.920 --> 09:51.651
-Oh, I can't wait to talk to this guy.
-Wait! You can't say anything.

09:51.824 --> 09:54.088
-Why not?
-Because he'll know I told you.

09:54.260 --> 09:57.661
Besides, he's giving me a parking spot
around the corner for nothing.

09:57.830 --> 09:59.889
So because you're
getting free parking...

10:00.066 --> 10:01.897
...I gotta pretend
this guy had cancer?

10:02.068 --> 10:03.797
Yeah.

10:04.770 --> 10:06.260
Well, I don't like it.

10:06.439 --> 10:09.374
I don't like it one bit. And
I'm supposed to see him tomorrow.

10:09.542 --> 10:11.237
Maintain the same disposition.

10:11.410 --> 10:13.708
You can't act any differently.
You have to be nice.

10:13.879 --> 10:16.609
-Why didn't he tell me?
-Because you were being so nice.

10:16.782 --> 10:19.444
-I don't think I could be that nice.
-You be nice!

10:36.369 --> 10:37.734
Gary?

10:37.903 --> 10:39.336
What do you think?

10:39.505 --> 10:41.200
Check it out.

10:45.244 --> 10:48.213
-Is that from my gift certificate?
-Yeah, buddy.

10:48.381 --> 10:50.315
You came through.
You've been so nice.

10:50.483 --> 10:53.213
Yeah, well, I'm glad you could
take advantage.

10:53.386 --> 10:56.753
Yeah. Hey, know what
I'm thinking of doing?

10:56.922 --> 11:00.358
I'm getting rid of all my fillings
because that mercury's toxic.

11:00.526 --> 11:02.994
-Hey, let me see your fillings.
-I don't think so.

11:03.629 --> 11:05.859
Oh, come on. Open up.
Let me take a look.

11:06.499 --> 11:09.366
<i>You be nice.
He's giving me a parking space.</i>

11:09.535 --> 11:13.027
<i>Parking space. Parking space.</i>

11:17.309 --> 11:18.867
Well, what do you know.

11:19.045 --> 11:23.573
-Hey, lookie there. You're loaded.
-Okay.

11:24.116 --> 11:25.344
Hey, look who's over there.

11:25.851 --> 11:27.409
Miss Cool Toes.

11:28.287 --> 11:30.187
Check this out, Jack.

11:31.257 --> 11:33.225
Hey, buddy.

11:33.392 --> 11:34.882
Hey.

11:35.494 --> 11:37.689
Look at you. What's this?

11:37.863 --> 11:41.094
-It's an eye patch.
-You look like a pirate.

11:41.567 --> 11:43.558
I wanna be a pirate.

11:44.437 --> 11:46.837
-This is Gary.
-How are you doing?

11:53.713 --> 11:56.238
Well, I tell you, there's
only one problem.

12:00.686 --> 12:02.449
Can't see on your right side?

12:03.022 --> 12:06.253
No. It's itchy.

12:08.561 --> 12:11.052
-Nice car.
-Yeah.

12:11.597 --> 12:13.758
Once belonged to Jon Voight.

12:13.933 --> 12:16.367
-Really?
-Sure did.

12:19.505 --> 12:23.566
So, what made you just call
me out of the blue like that?

12:23.743 --> 12:28.612
Oh, well, Gary told me you said hi.

12:29.381 --> 12:32.942
-I didn't say hi.
-You didn't?

12:33.119 --> 12:37.488
No, I told him to send you my regards.
I didn't say hi.

12:37.890 --> 12:41.417
-Regards?
-Yeah, regards.

12:44.864 --> 12:47.332
Anyway, I admit I was dumb
to go to the bookstore...

12:47.500 --> 12:50.901
...to tell him I didn't say hi,
but he didn't have to act so smug.

12:51.070 --> 12:53.470
Oh, I hate smugness.
Don't you hate smugness?

12:53.639 --> 12:56.608
Smugness is not a good quality.

12:56.876 --> 12:59.174
Oh, my God, that man over there.

12:59.345 --> 13:04.146
I think he's wearing glasses that look
like Jake's. Pull over. Stop the car.

13:04.650 --> 13:07.619
Here. I think I've got a way
of getting back at my ex-boyfriend.

13:07.787 --> 13:10.813
Good. Revenge is very good.

13:11.557 --> 13:13.252
Excuse me.

13:13.425 --> 13:16.826
-Excuse me. Excuse me. Sir, sir?
-Yeah.

13:17.997 --> 13:21.296
If you don't mind my asking, could you
tell me where you got your glasses?

13:21.467 --> 13:22.934
-Malaysia.
-Malaysia?

13:23.102 --> 13:24.694
Yeah.

13:24.870 --> 13:28.306
Look, I know this'll sound odd,
but can I buy them from you?

13:29.175 --> 13:33.509
Actually, I was gonna buy a new pair.
But I can barely see without these.

13:34.079 --> 13:38.311
-Come on.
-Well, these were expensive.

13:38.517 --> 13:40.508
Let's start the bidding.

13:41.620 --> 13:43.713
So you didn't think this was a date?

13:43.889 --> 13:46.551
No, not really. Why? Is it a date?

13:46.725 --> 13:48.124
I thought it was a date.

13:48.294 --> 13:50.489
No, it's not a date.

13:50.663 --> 13:53.131
-What about the regards?
-Regards don't mean anything.

13:53.299 --> 13:55.790
I mean, it's not like I said hi.

13:56.001 --> 13:57.992
I mean, the fact is...

13:58.804 --> 14:01.773
-...I shouldn't say anything.
-No, tell me.

14:01.974 --> 14:05.501
-Can you keep a secret?
-Me? Oh, yeah.

14:07.179 --> 14:10.171
I never had feelings for Gary
until he got sick.

14:10.349 --> 14:16.185
But he was so brave and gained
such a wonderful perspective on life.

14:16.589 --> 14:18.284
I fell in love with him.

14:18.457 --> 14:20.755
Yeah, he's got some
perspective there.

14:21.160 --> 14:23.890
-Hey, you know what the whip does?
-What whip?

14:24.063 --> 14:26.623
The whip in the Senate
and the House.

14:26.799 --> 14:29.324
Well, in the old days when
the senators didn't vote...

14:29.501 --> 14:33.130
...the way that the party leaders
wanted them to, they whipped them.

14:34.607 --> 14:40.307
"You better vote the way we want you
to, or there's gonna be big trouble."

14:42.481 --> 14:44.415
She won't talk to anyone, huh?

14:44.583 --> 14:48.280
Oh, no, she won't say a word
to anybody.

14:48.454 --> 14:53.357
Well, she's talking
a blue streak now, Jack.

14:59.498 --> 15:02.661
Well, well, the white whale.

15:03.102 --> 15:05.627
Oh, look at this. There's no
place to park around here.

15:05.804 --> 15:07.669
I don't know why
they even sell cars here.

15:07.840 --> 15:10.070
Don't complain.
At least you have your health.

15:16.015 --> 15:18.006
George, watch out for that man!

15:22.421 --> 15:25.390
Hey, hey, get back here.

15:25.891 --> 15:29.258
Newman? The white whale.

15:30.629 --> 15:32.824
Can you believe he sold
his glasses on the street?

15:32.998 --> 15:37.526
Can you believe someone would lie
about chemotherapy to get a wig?

15:38.103 --> 15:41.197
-Would you do that?
-No, definitely not.

15:41.373 --> 15:43.341
I'm pretty sure I wouldn't.

15:43.509 --> 15:46.239
Know what else? He picked
up that woman in the coffee shop.

15:46.545 --> 15:48.137
-The one who sits by herself?
-Yeah.

15:48.314 --> 15:49.975
-How?
-Because he was brimming...

15:50.149 --> 15:53.380
-...with confidence from the toupee.
-Really?

15:53.552 --> 15:57.682
Debby told me she fell in love with
him because he has perspective.

15:57.856 --> 16:00.017
She thinks a guy who lies
about an illness...

16:00.192 --> 16:02.490
...so he can get some phony hair
has perspective?

16:06.932 --> 16:09.400
-He picked her up?
-Walked right over to her table.

16:10.169 --> 16:11.659
Wow.

16:18.744 --> 16:22.202
Jake. Jake, take a look.

16:23.015 --> 16:25.848
See? You're not the only one who
has them. I have them too.

16:26.018 --> 16:28.851
-Where did you get those?
-Malaysia. I was in the area.

16:33.525 --> 16:35.686
-Kramer.
-Just drive.

16:35.861 --> 16:38.989
All right. Now you listen,
and you listen good.

16:39.164 --> 16:41.064
I know who you are.

16:41.233 --> 16:43.463
You're the scofflaw.

16:43.969 --> 16:48.303
-What are you talking about?
-Don't play dumb. It's me, Cosmo.

16:48.974 --> 16:50.532
All right, so it's me. So what?

16:50.709 --> 16:54.509
You don't think I know how you're
feeling every second of the day?

16:54.680 --> 16:57.581
Looking over your shoulder to see
if someone's coming up...

16:57.750 --> 17:00.378
...sitting alone at night knowing
they could be closing in.

17:00.552 --> 17:04.852
-I can't sleep, I tell you. I can't sleep.
-Of course you can't, you poor sap.

17:05.023 --> 17:07.788
-Why didn't you tell me?
-I couldn't. I couldn't tell anyone.

17:07.960 --> 17:10.053
So you've been living this secret
by yourself?

17:10.229 --> 17:12.595
-It's been awful.
-Yeah.

17:13.165 --> 17:15.497
I wanted to tell somebody.

17:15.666 --> 17:19.296
-Help me, Kramer. Help me.
-All right, I'm gonna help you.

17:19.471 --> 17:22.702
I'll try some on, we'll see
how they look. It's just hair.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.809
Ever see what that
looks like in the back?

17:24.977 --> 17:26.740
You got natural curls
on the bottom...

17:26.912 --> 17:29.642
...and that big phony mat
coming down on top of it.

17:29.815 --> 17:32.579
Some look good. The ones that
look good, you don't know about.

17:32.751 --> 17:35.345
What if you got involved with a
woman? How do you tell her?

17:35.521 --> 17:37.853
The way they make them,
I'll never have to tell her.

17:38.023 --> 17:40.116
So you keep it a secret
your whole life?

17:40.292 --> 17:43.125
Then at your funeral, the mortician
comes out, "Mrs. Costanza...

17:43.295 --> 17:45.559
...I thought you might want this."

17:48.534 --> 17:52.095
It's no secret that it's my dream
to have my own publishing house.

17:52.271 --> 17:55.502
If this Jake Jarmel book does, you
know, what I think it's gonna do...

17:55.674 --> 17:58.302
...if I can get this whole thing off
the ground, then...

17:58.477 --> 18:02.777
-...I think I'll have something for you.
-Oh, Mr. Lippman.

18:03.515 --> 18:06.450
That is so exciting. I mean,
you have no idea...

18:06.618 --> 18:10.145
...how sick I am of running
around town looking for socks.

18:10.589 --> 18:12.580
By the way, those are great glasses.

18:12.758 --> 18:15.420
-Oh, really, you like them?
-Very unusual.

18:15.594 --> 18:17.255
-Well, you know what?
-What?

18:17.429 --> 18:18.862
-You can have them.
-No, no.

18:19.031 --> 18:20.828
No, no. Go to that
place on the corner.

18:20.999 --> 18:23.399
They'll change the prescription
in an hour. Take them.

18:23.569 --> 18:25.036
-Really?
-I have no use for them.

18:25.204 --> 18:26.466
-Honestly.
-I could use...

18:26.638 --> 18:29.471
-...a new pair of reading glasses.
-They're from Malaysia.

18:29.641 --> 18:32.508
-Oh, yeah?
-Fabulous.

18:34.079 --> 18:36.570
Well, Mr. Newman, in all
my years on the bench...

18:36.748 --> 18:40.809
...I have never come across
anything quite like this.

18:41.720 --> 18:46.817
I have given this matter some serious
consideration, and I've decided that...

18:46.992 --> 18:51.929
...what's best for the city and possibly
yourself, is for you to keep your car...

18:52.097 --> 18:56.193
...in a garage that is conveniently
located next to your home.

18:56.368 --> 18:57.960
I can't afford that.

18:58.270 --> 19:01.137
Afford it you will, Mr. Newman...

19:01.306 --> 19:05.675
...or this court will see that your car
is impounded and sold at auction.

19:05.844 --> 19:08.904
Well, don't you worry, Your Honor.
He's in my custody.

19:14.853 --> 19:16.480
Well, what do you think?

19:18.690 --> 19:21.250
I really can't say.

19:22.261 --> 19:25.253
-No, say. I want you to say.
-It's not good, okay?

19:25.430 --> 19:27.227
It's not good.

19:27.399 --> 19:28.696
You look...

19:28.867 --> 19:30.266
...stupid.

19:30.435 --> 19:31.766
I'm sorry.

19:32.237 --> 19:35.434
You have to realize this has not
been custom-fitted to his scalp.

19:35.607 --> 19:37.768
I really think this looks pretty good.

19:37.943 --> 19:40.002
Why not get white shoes,
move to Miami Beach...

19:40.179 --> 19:42.170
...and get the whole thing over with?

19:46.118 --> 19:48.052
Maybe you could
show me something else.

19:48.220 --> 19:52.156
As I said, it'll be different once we
design something specifically for you.

19:52.324 --> 19:54.849
But I don't think your friend
here is being very helpful.

19:55.027 --> 19:58.326
Oh, hey. I'm being helpful.
I am the only one being helpful.

19:58.497 --> 20:01.159
I don't think you're being helpful!
You're being disruptive.

20:01.333 --> 20:03.893
You make it difficult for your friend
to improve his life.

20:04.069 --> 20:06.594
I'm preventing him from
becoming one of those guys...

20:06.772 --> 20:09.673
...people snicker at
because they look ridiculous.

20:09.841 --> 20:12.036
No offense to you personally.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.270
You people with hair think
you're so superior.

20:14.446 --> 20:15.936
You have no idea what it's like.

20:16.114 --> 20:18.514
You ever look in the tub
and see a fistful of hair?

20:18.684 --> 20:19.912
Start your day with that!

20:20.085 --> 20:22.576
All right. Take it easy.
Take it easy.

20:22.754 --> 20:24.312
I'm sorry.

20:24.623 --> 20:26.250
Please.

20:29.695 --> 20:31.663
Hey, Jerry.

20:31.964 --> 20:34.262
George, you decided to get a rug.

20:34.433 --> 20:36.958
Good for you, Jack.

20:38.136 --> 20:40.366
Well, I'm just looking, really.

20:40.539 --> 20:44.908
Tommy, I'm gonna
need a little adjustment.

20:45.744 --> 20:47.712
I'll be right with you.

20:51.516 --> 20:54.383
Listen, George,
I got some bad news.

20:54.553 --> 20:56.919
I'm not gonna be able
to give you that parking space.

20:57.089 --> 20:59.182
-What?
-What?

20:59.358 --> 21:01.690
This judge has to use it
for some scofflaw.

21:01.860 --> 21:04.522
And you know,
you can't fight city hall.

21:09.167 --> 21:11.431
You know, Gary...

21:14.172 --> 21:16.834
...I had a little chat with
George the other day.

21:17.342 --> 21:18.673
-You didn't!
-I did.

21:18.844 --> 21:20.744
And he told me that--

21:20.912 --> 21:23.540
-I'm not 100 percent recovered yet.
-Give me that thing.

21:41.066 --> 21:43.159
How's your life? All right?

21:43.335 --> 21:45.895
Yeah, not bad at all.

22:02.020 --> 22:04.511
And now, ladies and
gentlemen of the press...

22:04.690 --> 22:09.923
...it is my pleasure to introduce
you to Mr. Jake Jarmel.

22:10.662 --> 22:13.460
So, Jake, what's your
percentage on this book?

22:13.632 --> 22:16.760
Actually, I have some very
interesting information on that.

22:16.935 --> 22:19.768
-You know, this is a co-venture--
-Where did you get those?

22:19.938 --> 22:21.599
-And as such it--
-Those glasses.

22:21.773 --> 22:24.105
-Where did you get those glasses?
-Where?

22:24.276 --> 22:27.109
Is this supposed to be
some kind of a joke on me?

22:27.279 --> 22:30.339
Because it's not very funny.
Give me those.

22:30.515 --> 22:32.881
-I want the glasses. Give me those.
-Wait. Calm down.

22:33.051 --> 22:34.985
-Give me those.
-Don't touch me!

22:35.153 --> 22:37.781
I'm gonna go look for some socks.

22:38.305 --> 22:44.543
