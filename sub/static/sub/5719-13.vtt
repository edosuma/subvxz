00:00.343 --> 00:01.859
Previously on "Heartland"...

00:01.912 --> 00:04.380
Let's do it.
Let's move in together.

00:04.415 --> 00:06.349
I don't think you understand
what I'm trying to say.

00:06.383 --> 00:08.485
I wanna buy this place
on my own.

00:09.499 --> 00:11.254
- Yes!
- You got us out!

00:11.288 --> 00:13.423
We did it! We did it!
We got out!

00:13.457 --> 00:15.692
Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh... Um...

00:17.661 --> 00:19.262
- Ah! There's my dad. Let's go.
- Yeah.

00:19.296 --> 00:21.931
- I'm giving you the horse.
- You know it's not that easy.

00:21.966 --> 00:25.401
I screwed everything up.
I know that.

00:25.436 --> 00:26.870
I loved you, I really did.

00:26.904 --> 00:29.606
Yeah. I guess that's
what makes this so difficult.

01:07.178 --> 01:10.380
Jack, I'm gonna have
to take off to the diner.

01:12.149 --> 01:14.651
I'm gonna have to take
off to the diner, I said.

01:14.685 --> 01:16.619
You know, it's a heck of a week
that Lou picked

01:16.654 --> 01:19.022
to go on vacation, again.

01:19.056 --> 01:20.690
Good thing Casey's gonna help
me out.

01:20.724 --> 01:23.193
She's gonna meet me there.

01:23.227 --> 01:27.463
Jack! Did you hear anything
I said? Jack!

01:27.498 --> 01:31.634
- Did you lose something?
- Yes, I did. My phone.

01:31.669 --> 01:33.937
It's brand new.
Lisa bought it for me.

01:36.640 --> 01:38.408
You know, I gotta say,
I admire the fact

01:38.442 --> 01:41.678
that Lisa's trying to at least
bring you into the 20th century.

01:41.712 --> 01:45.215
Don't you mean 21st century?

01:45.249 --> 01:47.283
Well, she's not
a miracle worker.

01:47.318 --> 01:50.186
All right. Didn't you say
you had somewhere to be?

01:50.221 --> 01:51.821
I do.

01:53.857 --> 01:56.226
Oh God...

01:56.260 --> 02:00.233
All right.
Oh... Katie, honey,

02:00.898 --> 02:03.733
all you've done is lick
the butter off this toast.

02:03.767 --> 02:05.134
That's 'cause I love butter.

02:05.169 --> 02:06.669
Well, yes, I know you do,

02:06.704 --> 02:08.204
but then you're going
to be hungry later.

02:08.239 --> 02:10.273
And so I need you to come
and sit down and eat.

02:10.306 --> 02:11.641
Can I have butter on it?

02:11.675 --> 02:13.876
No. You already licked
the butter off,

02:13.911 --> 02:15.311
so come on now.

02:15.346 --> 02:17.046
- Good morning.
- Hi!

02:17.081 --> 02:18.448
Come on, we almost have to go.

02:18.482 --> 02:20.183
Hey, have you seen
your grandfather this morning?

02:20.217 --> 02:21.754
No, I haven't.

02:21.837 --> 02:24.053
Well, he's supposed to pick Georgie
up at the wildlife reserve,

02:24.088 --> 02:25.455
and I've been calling him
all morning.

02:25.489 --> 02:26.856
He won't answer.

02:26.890 --> 02:30.126
Um... that's probably because
his phone is right here.

02:30.160 --> 02:33.129
What?

02:33.163 --> 02:37.567
Of course it is...
and it's not on. Shoot!

02:37.601 --> 02:39.202
Lisa, I can pick up Georgie
at the reserve

02:39.236 --> 02:40.637
if that helps you.

02:40.671 --> 02:41.685
You look like you have
your hands full.

02:41.751 --> 02:43.780
- Really? Can you? - Yeah.
- Okay, great. Thank you.

02:43.845 --> 02:45.675
And can you just watch her
for a moment?

02:45.709 --> 02:47.510
I have to go find
her ballet slippers.

02:47.544 --> 02:50.179
- Yeah. Of course. Good morning, Katie.
- Okay.

02:50.214 --> 02:53.950
Auntie Amy, can I please
have some butter on my toast?

02:53.984 --> 02:55.718
Yeah, of course.
I'll grab you some.

03:06.964 --> 03:09.032
Why would you wanna run
for Class President?

03:09.066 --> 03:10.767
Isn't it just a popularity
contest?

03:10.801 --> 03:12.201
I'd like to think
our fellow classmates

03:12.236 --> 03:15.071
would vote for someone
who's right for the job.

03:15.105 --> 03:17.907
Especially if they care
for issues like...

03:17.941 --> 03:20.310
extended library hours
and more secure bike racks.

03:20.344 --> 03:23.046
I think you're giving our "fellow
students" way too much credit.

03:23.080 --> 03:25.214
They're just gonna vote for
Olivia 'cause she's popular.

03:25.249 --> 03:28.051
- I'm popular.
- On what planet?

03:28.085 --> 03:29.585
Olivia has her friends
and I have mine.

03:29.620 --> 03:31.454
Just because they're not
football players or cheerleaders

03:31.488 --> 03:32.989
doesn't mean their votes
don't count.

03:33.023 --> 03:34.991
So you're actually serious
about this?

03:35.025 --> 03:37.427
I wouldn't be running
if I didn't think I could win.

03:38.676 --> 03:40.704
I'll get started with those branches.
Are you good with the feed?

03:40.803 --> 03:42.999
Uh, yeah, j0ust be careful
when you go over there.

03:43.033 --> 03:45.134
Those llamas spit.

03:45.169 --> 03:47.770
Actually llamas spitting
at people is mostly a myth.

03:47.805 --> 03:49.672
They're much more likely
to spit at each other

03:49.707 --> 03:51.774
in order to discipline lower
ranked members of the herd.

03:51.809 --> 03:54.344
- But Ty said...
- It's actually quite interesting.

03:54.378 --> 03:56.579
A llama's place in the herd's
hierarchy is never static.

03:56.613 --> 03:58.014
They move up and down
the social ladder

03:58.048 --> 03:59.615
by spitting and fighting.

03:59.650 --> 04:02.952
Wow. You sure like
to hear yourself talk.

04:02.986 --> 04:04.754
Maybe you should go
into politics.

04:04.788 --> 04:06.889
Thank you.

04:06.924 --> 04:09.359
It wasn't a compliment.

04:15.632 --> 04:18.166
Eww! Disgusting!

04:21.171 --> 04:23.239
This is totally gross!
What're you doing?

04:24.808 --> 04:26.175
Are you recording this?!

04:26.210 --> 04:27.577
I'm documenting llama behaviour.

04:27.611 --> 04:29.612
This is not funny!

04:29.646 --> 04:31.514
Georgie!

04:33.484 --> 04:35.985
I thought we already had
this conversation.

04:36.019 --> 04:39.455
I thought you liked
your bachelor lifestyle.

04:41.325 --> 04:44.560
Yeah, but every man's gotta
grow up sometime.

04:46.830 --> 04:49.632
Besides, Case, aren't you tired
of going back and forth

04:49.666 --> 04:52.068
between our places?

04:52.102 --> 04:53.836
I don't know.
We've made it work this long.

04:53.871 --> 04:55.605
Can somebody get that, please?

04:55.639 --> 04:57.073
Yeah. Well, we've managed.

04:57.107 --> 05:02.044
Yeah, and it's been good.
But it could be so much better.

05:02.079 --> 05:04.680
You know, last time we talked about it,
you weren't ready, I wasn't ready.

05:04.715 --> 05:06.482
But I think now, I think now...

05:06.517 --> 05:09.552
I think we're ready.
Please, will someone get that!

05:11.914 --> 05:12.854
What do you say?

05:12.937 --> 05:16.192
I say you should go get that order.

05:16.226 --> 05:17.593
Okay. Will you think about it?

05:17.628 --> 05:21.564
Okay, okay! Coming.

05:23.233 --> 05:26.169
Yeah! Give me this bell.

05:26.203 --> 05:28.671
What does a girl have to do
to get a coffee around here?

05:28.705 --> 05:30.106
She just has to sit down

05:30.140 --> 05:32.408
and a waitress will be right
with her.

05:34.678 --> 05:37.580
- Janice.
- Hey, Tim.

You know, I knew you lost
money at the track, but...

06:23.026 --> 06:24.393
I never thought I'd see the day

06:24.428 --> 06:26.896
where Tim Fleming was waiting
on tables.

06:28.365 --> 06:30.600
I own the place.

06:30.634 --> 06:33.636
Just... have to give these
to these people.

06:33.670 --> 06:35.505
Oh. Thank you!

06:35.539 --> 06:37.406
There you go.

06:41.035 --> 06:42.778
What brings you here?

06:42.813 --> 06:46.115
I was just passing through town.

06:46.149 --> 06:48.050
You look well.

06:48.085 --> 06:50.119
So do you.

06:50.153 --> 06:54.490
Hey, Tim, do you know
where these nylon halters go?

06:54.525 --> 06:56.158
Hello.

06:56.193 --> 06:58.494
Oh, this is Janice. She is a,

06:58.529 --> 07:00.863
was a business associate
of mine.

07:00.898 --> 07:03.199
And, uh, okay, uh, Janice,

07:03.233 --> 07:05.134
this is Casey,
she's my girlfriend.

07:07.104 --> 07:08.671
- Hi.
- Hi.

07:08.705 --> 07:10.873
It's, it's nice to meet you.

07:10.908 --> 07:14.644
I was, um, actually
just heading out.

07:14.678 --> 07:16.746
Goodbye, Tim.

07:19.116 --> 07:23.119
Uh, those... go at the back,
just... at the way back.

07:23.153 --> 07:24.554
Just make room.

07:24.588 --> 07:26.355
If there's not room, make it.

07:26.390 --> 07:28.558
Excuse me for one second.

07:30.527 --> 07:33.829
Janice. Hey! Janice, come on.

07:33.864 --> 07:35.998
Really, Tim? Business associate?

07:36.033 --> 07:37.500
I panicked.

07:38.561 --> 07:40.303
If you wanted a formal
introduction,

07:40.337 --> 07:41.737
you could've picked up
the phone.

07:41.772 --> 07:43.673
Wait, you think I planned this?

07:43.707 --> 07:46.509
I'm on my way back to Edmonton,
where I live now.

07:46.543 --> 07:48.077
All I wanted was a cup
of coffee.

07:48.111 --> 07:50.279
How was I supposed to know
you bought the diner?

07:50.314 --> 07:51.647
Cut me some slack.

07:51.682 --> 07:53.449
You're the last person
I expected to see today.

07:53.483 --> 07:55.785
You're the last person
I expected to see ever.

07:55.819 --> 07:58.387
That makes two of us.

07:58.422 --> 08:01.924
Well, just come back inside
and we'll have a conversation.

08:01.959 --> 08:04.226
What about your girlfriend?

08:04.261 --> 08:06.462
Well, we'll walk.

08:06.496 --> 08:08.130
Come on.

08:08.165 --> 08:10.232
Janice, come on.

08:15.505 --> 08:18.140
No, Lisa, I like my new phone.

08:18.175 --> 08:20.276
I'm real fond of it.

08:20.310 --> 08:23.946
You're so fond of it,
you left it here this morning.

08:23.981 --> 08:27.249
Yeah, it was tough getting up
today.

08:27.284 --> 08:29.619
I was still half asleep
when I left.

08:29.653 --> 08:31.587
I'm surprised I remembered
to put on my pants,

08:31.622 --> 08:33.155
never mind the phone.

08:33.190 --> 08:35.191
You seem to be heading
to bed later and later.

08:35.225 --> 08:36.993
Is everything okay?

08:37.027 --> 08:40.763
Well, Tim's at the diner
all the time 'cause Lou's gone.

08:40.797 --> 08:42.398
That leaves me
with twice the work.

08:42.432 --> 08:43.933
There aren't enough hours
in the day.

08:43.967 --> 08:45.236
I'm getting worn out.

08:45.352 --> 08:48.938
Well, maybe you should consider
hiring someone to help you.

08:48.972 --> 08:52.241
Not even maybe. I'm gonna do it.

08:52.275 --> 08:56.905
In fact... I'm gonna use
the phone

08:57.014 --> 09:01.017
my beautiful wife gave me
to make a few calls.

09:01.051 --> 09:03.584
I might even send a text.

09:04.554 --> 09:06.889
- Thanks for picking me up.
- Hey, no problem.

09:06.923 --> 09:08.924
You know, the one good thing
about Ty being away for so long

09:08.959 --> 09:10.960
is I get extra time
with my nieces.

09:10.994 --> 09:12.962
- Do you miss him?
- Yeah. I do.

09:12.996 --> 09:14.897
But I definitely don't
miss his feet.

09:14.931 --> 09:17.033
- What?
- They're always so cold!

09:17.067 --> 09:18.668
Even in July,
when he gets into bed...

09:18.702 --> 09:20.670
Don't tell him I told you.

09:20.704 --> 09:22.905
Hey, Georgie! Over here!

09:22.939 --> 09:25.875
Ah...
I better go say hi.

09:25.909 --> 09:27.943
Yeah, I'll be inside.

09:27.978 --> 09:30.212
I hope I can count
on your vote next week.

09:30.247 --> 09:32.014
Here, have an official
campaign cookie.

09:32.049 --> 09:34.350
- They're homemade.
- Thanks.

09:34.384 --> 09:36.185
Can you believe Adam is
actually running against me?

09:36.219 --> 09:39.288
Well, you're not afraid of a little
competition, are you, Olivia?

09:39.322 --> 09:42.258
Hardly.
Like he even stands a chance.

09:42.292 --> 09:44.660
I mean, who cares about library
hours and bike racks.

09:44.695 --> 09:46.262
I stand for important things,

09:46.296 --> 09:48.064
like making sure there are more
stalls in the girl's washroom

09:48.098 --> 09:50.466
and banning all junior high
boys from wearing cargo shorts.

09:50.500 --> 09:53.369
I mean, why do they need
so many pockets anyways?

09:53.403 --> 09:56.305
Okay. Well, good-good luck.

09:56.339 --> 09:58.274
Um, hey! Do you remember
all those photos that you took

09:58.308 --> 09:59.709
while we were taking trick
riding lessons?

09:59.743 --> 10:01.310
Yeah.

10:01.344 --> 10:02.978
I need them
for my campaign website.

10:03.013 --> 10:04.947
Just the ones that make me look
super hardcore.

10:04.981 --> 10:08.084
Okay. I'll email you the link
to my public folder

10:08.118 --> 10:09.854
and you can pick the ones
you want.

10:09.953 --> 10:11.687
Perfect. And you don't mind helping
me pass these out, do you?

10:11.722 --> 10:13.789
- Oh, well...
- Thank you!

10:15.225 --> 10:17.426
Hey, you guys! Do you want
some campaign buttons?

10:17.461 --> 10:18.994
So the ribs are on special

10:19.029 --> 10:20.963
and the soup is Moroccan
chicken.

10:20.997 --> 10:23.632
And the pie is strawberry
rhubarb.

10:26.837 --> 10:30.039
- Who's Janice?
- What?

10:30.073 --> 10:32.308
Janice. You know who that is?

10:32.342 --> 10:34.410
Oh, um...

10:34.444 --> 10:37.079
Because your dad introduced
her as his "business associate",

10:37.114 --> 10:39.648
but I'm not really buying that.

10:39.683 --> 10:41.851
She didn't really act
like a "business associate."

10:41.885 --> 10:44.086
So Janice was here?

10:44.121 --> 10:46.856
What kind of business
did they do together?

10:46.890 --> 10:51.260
Um... horse racing.
Janice was my dad's jockey.

10:51.294 --> 10:55.034
So that's it?
She was just his jockey?

10:58.168 --> 11:01.170
Oh, she's beautiful.
What's her name?

11:01.204 --> 11:05.407
Sophie. We named her
after Stan's grandmother.

11:05.442 --> 11:08.444
- Stan the father?
- Yes, my husband.

11:08.478 --> 11:10.579
Wow, you don't waste
any time, do you?

11:10.614 --> 11:12.782
I'm gonna pretend
you said congratulations

11:12.816 --> 11:14.383
and that you're happy for me.

11:14.417 --> 11:15.851
Congratulations.
I'm happy for you.

11:17.287 --> 11:20.923
I am. Janice, I'm happy for you.

11:20.957 --> 11:22.980
Thanks.

11:25.162 --> 11:27.296
You know, if it weren't for you,

11:27.330 --> 11:28.798
I never would've met Stan.

11:28.832 --> 11:30.466
- Really.
- Yeah.

11:30.500 --> 11:31.967
After you gave me Cisco back,

11:32.002 --> 11:33.469
I had to find someone
to partner up with

11:33.503 --> 11:35.004
so I could still be a jockey.

11:35.038 --> 11:37.473
So how is Cisco anyway?

11:37.507 --> 11:40.676
Cisco is retired
to a nice big pasture.

11:40.710 --> 11:43.379
Are you still in the game?

11:43.413 --> 11:45.981
No, um... I haven't jockeyed
since the baby,

11:46.016 --> 11:49.118
but yeah, Stan and I own
a couple of racehorses.

11:50.754 --> 11:52.254
Risky business.

11:52.289 --> 11:54.590
Yeah. Tell me about it.

11:54.624 --> 11:56.225
We've got this new horse,
Danger.

11:56.259 --> 11:58.260
We had really high hopes
for him.

11:58.295 --> 12:00.963
But he hasn't even come close to finishing
in the money his last two races.

12:00.997 --> 12:03.299
When we first got him,
all he wanted to do was win.

12:03.333 --> 12:06.836
Now he could care less.
I just... I don't get it.

12:06.870 --> 12:08.604
Well, it's too bad.
If he was with you here,

12:08.638 --> 12:10.506
I'd tell you to go see Amy.

12:10.540 --> 12:11.974
Well, actually, I just came
from a race,

12:12.008 --> 12:13.809
so he's in the trailer.

12:13.844 --> 12:17.087
Well, then stop by Heartland,
let Amy have a look.

12:18.114 --> 12:19.982
Yeah, I don't know, Tim.
Maybe we it's...

12:20.016 --> 12:21.417
better we leave the past
in the past.

12:21.451 --> 12:24.620
Janice, come on. We're adults.

12:24.654 --> 12:26.355
We've both moved on
with our lives.

12:26.389 --> 12:30.025
You need to win a few races.
Go see Amy.

12:35.999 --> 12:38.934
Nice work! You're really
getting the hang of this.

12:38.969 --> 12:40.502
Thanks!

12:44.608 --> 12:46.809
- Who's that?
- I don't know.

12:50.049 --> 12:52.214
I think that's Janice.

12:52.249 --> 12:54.016
What is she doing here?

12:54.050 --> 12:55.885
Who's Janice?

12:55.919 --> 12:58.988
She was my dad's jockey,
and his girlfriend.

12:59.022 --> 13:02.892
They dated for a long time
and it didn't end so well.

13:02.926 --> 13:05.461
- Hey, Amy.
- Hey!

13:06.930 --> 13:09.798
Wow! How long's it been?
Three, four years?

13:09.833 --> 13:11.166
Yeah, something like that.

13:11.201 --> 13:13.669
I heard you got married.
Congratulations.

13:13.703 --> 13:15.070
Thank you.

13:15.105 --> 13:16.705
And you must be Georgie.

13:16.740 --> 13:18.607
Tim was just telling me
all about you.

13:18.642 --> 13:20.943
Nice to meet you.
It's cool that you're a jockey.

13:20.977 --> 13:24.079
Was a jockey.
I'm more of a horse owner now.

13:24.114 --> 13:27.416
- Actually, that's why I'm here.
- Oh?

13:27.450 --> 13:29.551
Listen, I didn't wanna take
up your time,

13:29.586 --> 13:32.021
but your dad insisted.

13:32.055 --> 13:35.891
I'm hoping that you can help me
with my horse.

13:35.926 --> 13:38.928
I know, deja vu, right?

13:42.933 --> 13:45.234
Case, technically
she's a business associate.

13:45.268 --> 13:47.836
You can't just be up front
with me about this?

13:47.871 --> 13:49.738
Well, we were in business
together

13:49.773 --> 13:51.774
and then it became more than
business and then it ended.

13:51.808 --> 13:53.409
The point is, it's in the past

13:53.443 --> 13:55.544
and what's important now
is you and me.

13:55.578 --> 13:57.079
Look, I'm not a teenager.

13:57.113 --> 13:58.814
I don't need some
platitude-filled speech

13:58.848 --> 14:00.449
about how I'm the only woman
in your life.

14:00.483 --> 14:03.752
I know that you've had wives
and girlfriends before me.

14:03.787 --> 14:06.522
One. One wife.

14:07.958 --> 14:10.159
The point is, it doesn't
scare me.

14:10.193 --> 14:12.895
But next time one of your
ex-girlfriends comes walking in here,

14:12.929 --> 14:16.165
could you just let me know
who she is?

14:16.199 --> 14:18.500
I will.

14:19.970 --> 14:22.037
I will. I promise.

14:22.072 --> 14:23.539
You're amazing.

14:23.573 --> 14:26.308
Aw.

14:26.343 --> 14:28.010
Thank you.

14:28.044 --> 14:31.547
Oh, and by the way, um,
if we ever do break up

14:31.581 --> 14:33.549
and you introduce me
to your future girlfriend

14:33.583 --> 14:37.386
as your "business associate,"
I will kill you.

14:41.191 --> 14:44.760
Georgie?
You have a visitor.

14:44.794 --> 14:48.964
Oh. Adam. We don't have
a tutoring session, do we?

14:48.999 --> 14:53.135
No. But I need to talk to you
about something.

14:53.169 --> 14:55.938
I'll be downstairs
if you need me.

14:55.972 --> 14:58.307
I know what you did Georgie
and it's not funny.

14:58.341 --> 15:00.009
What do you mean?

15:06.249 --> 15:08.250
Ew! Disgusting!

15:08.284 --> 15:11.687
This is totally gross!
What're doing?

15:11.721 --> 15:13.989
- Over a hundred views.
- Are you recording this?!

15:14.024 --> 15:16.625
- You must be proud.
- I didn't do this.

15:16.659 --> 15:18.660
You're the one who took the
video. It was on your phone.

15:18.695 --> 15:21.597
I know but I didn't post this.
Adam, you have to believe me.

15:21.631 --> 15:23.365
The one thing I've learned
from moving around so much,

15:23.400 --> 15:25.334
is that kids are
the same everywhere.

15:25.368 --> 15:28.303
They're small minded
and just plain mean.

15:28.338 --> 15:30.606
Georgie, I'm not being funny!

15:30.640 --> 15:33.108
I don't know why I thought
you'd be any different.

15:33.143 --> 15:36.378
- Georgie!
- Adam!

15:38.181 --> 15:40.182
Stop filming me!

16:01.531 --> 16:04.466
So? What do you think?

16:04.924 --> 16:07.769
I don't know. I'd really like
to work with him another day.

16:07.804 --> 16:11.139
Maybe take him around
the track tomorrow.

16:11.174 --> 16:12.541
Tomorrow, huh...

16:12.575 --> 16:14.209
How long are you in town for?

16:14.243 --> 16:16.344
Well, I was hoping
to leave tonight.

16:16.379 --> 16:19.781
Janice, there's really not a
whole lot I can do in a few hours.

16:19.816 --> 16:22.217
Well, could you just give me
your first impression?

16:22.251 --> 16:25.987
Sure. You said he's well bred,

16:26.022 --> 16:27.556
but you can breed the best
with the best,

16:27.590 --> 16:30.091
it's not a perfect science,
you know.

16:30.126 --> 16:33.762
He can be big and fast,
but if he doesn't wanna win,

16:33.796 --> 16:35.597
You know, that's the x-factor.

16:35.631 --> 16:37.566
I know what the x-factor
looks like, Amy.

16:37.600 --> 16:39.568
You asked for my first
impression.

16:39.602 --> 16:41.303
I'm just being straight
with you.

16:41.337 --> 16:43.138
Danger doesn't have it.

16:43.172 --> 16:44.506
You should've seen him before.

16:44.540 --> 16:46.808
Okay, he had the x-factor
in spades.

16:46.843 --> 16:49.177
He wanted to win more
than he wanted food and water.

16:49.212 --> 16:51.379
How does that just go away?

16:51.414 --> 16:53.215
I'd love to help you work
with him,

16:53.249 --> 16:56.218
but I'm really gonna need
more than a day.

16:59.255 --> 17:01.356
Excuse me.

17:01.390 --> 17:03.825
Olivia, how could you?!
I didn't send you that video.

17:03.860 --> 17:06.027
Yes you did.
It was in your public folder.

17:06.061 --> 17:08.296
I just clicked on the link
you sent me and there it was.

17:08.330 --> 17:10.898
Well, it wasn't supposed to
be there. That was a mistake.

17:10.933 --> 17:13.201
Relax, Georgie.
Everyone thinks it's hilarious.

17:13.236 --> 17:15.303
They're calling Adam llama boy!

17:15.338 --> 17:16.872
You shouldn't have posted it.

17:16.906 --> 17:18.473
I didn't. I just sent
the link to Britney.

17:18.508 --> 17:20.407
She thought it was funny
so she sent it to Christine.

17:20.443 --> 17:21.943
Christine sent it to Taylor,

17:21.996 --> 17:23.843
and then Taylor probably
sent it to some other friend.

17:23.909 --> 17:25.380
Who knows how it ended up
online?

17:25.414 --> 17:27.382
Take it down.

17:27.415 --> 17:30.418
I just told you,
I have no idea who posted it.

17:30.453 --> 17:33.321
Maybe you should be more careful
about which files you send people.

17:33.356 --> 17:35.827
Somebody might take advantage
of you.

17:41.197 --> 17:43.064
Oh.

17:43.099 --> 17:46.619
Uh, that's you...
meowing.

17:47.303 --> 17:50.105
What is that?!

17:50.139 --> 17:52.040
Uh... Katie was playing
with your phone earlier.

17:52.074 --> 17:53.542
She probably changed
the setting.

17:53.576 --> 17:56.978
That's why we don't leave it
lying around.

17:57.013 --> 17:58.647
Oh, it's a text from Caleb.

17:58.681 --> 18:00.949
He said he'd help me out
tomorrow, by the way.

18:00.983 --> 18:02.350
Oh, good.

18:02.385 --> 18:04.619
Hey! I'm not late for dinner,
am I?

18:04.654 --> 18:06.121
Uh, we weren't expecting you.

18:06.155 --> 18:07.722
Casey's coming too.
She just took her own truck,

18:07.757 --> 18:10.325
- so she's a few minutes behind.
- Uhoh.

18:10.359 --> 18:12.561
That is okay, right?

18:12.595 --> 18:14.018
Yeah, it's just Janice...

18:14.110 --> 18:17.343
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
I should've told you about her.

18:17.433 --> 18:19.601
Did you look at her horse? Do
you know what's wrong with it?

18:19.635 --> 18:21.403
And that's the thing.
I-I needed more time,

18:21.437 --> 18:24.472
so she agreed to stay in town
for a few more days.

18:24.507 --> 18:25.874
There's an empty cabin
at the Dude Ranch,

18:25.908 --> 18:28.143
- so she's... there.
- Oh.

18:28.177 --> 18:31.546
And we invited her for dinner.

18:31.581 --> 18:33.615
I'll just call Casey and cancel.

18:33.649 --> 18:37.052
Hello, everybody.

18:37.086 --> 18:40.989
- Hey, you're here!
- Yeah... And look who I found.

18:41.023 --> 18:43.224
- Hey.
- Hi.

18:43.259 --> 18:46.194
- Hey! Hey...
- Dinner smells great.

18:46.228 --> 18:48.363
Come on in.
I will set some more places.

18:48.397 --> 18:50.031
Yeah. Come in.

18:50.066 --> 18:53.168
Just... Yeah.

18:56.973 --> 18:59.374
Mm. My rodeo school
is really doing well.

18:59.408 --> 19:02.077
Classes are booked for months
in advance.

19:02.111 --> 19:03.945
That's so great, Tim. Really.

19:03.980 --> 19:05.647
Yeah, yeah. Well, of course,

19:05.681 --> 19:08.183
I couldn't do it without
this one here.

19:08.217 --> 19:09.753
You know, she helps me
With the school,

19:09.806 --> 19:12.320
but she also does all the scheduling,
the books, the whole thing.

19:12.355 --> 19:14.623
Well, I am glad that someone
is keeping him organized.

19:14.657 --> 19:16.257
'Cause back when Tim and I
were racing,

19:16.292 --> 19:18.360
he could never remember
the schedule.

19:18.394 --> 19:20.028
I mean, I thought if we trained
on the days of the week

19:20.062 --> 19:22.731
that started with a "t"
you know, for training

19:22.765 --> 19:24.399
that that might help him
remember,

19:24.433 --> 19:26.501
but nope, didn't happen.

19:26.535 --> 19:28.336
He's the worst.

19:28.371 --> 19:31.673
I tried to get him onto this
online joint calendar thing

19:31.707 --> 19:33.975
an exercise in futility.

19:34.010 --> 19:37.379
Well, he used to have a calendar
on his fridge from 2007.

19:37.413 --> 19:39.080
We met in 2010.

19:39.115 --> 19:40.782
It's still there.

19:40.816 --> 19:42.317
No it's not!

19:42.351 --> 19:43.952
I like the pictures.

19:43.986 --> 19:45.818
Oh...

19:47.356 --> 19:48.723
Georgie, you're quiet tonight.

19:48.758 --> 19:51.226
How's everything? What's new?

19:51.260 --> 19:53.895
I'm fine. Nothing.

19:55.264 --> 19:57.432
Um... I'll get started
on the dishes.

19:57.466 --> 19:58.967
I'll give you a hand.

19:59.001 --> 20:01.870
What do you say we have
dessert in front of the fire?

20:01.904 --> 20:04.239
Great idea. I hope everyone
likes peach cobbler.

20:04.273 --> 20:06.708
Sounds good.

20:09.345 --> 20:11.179
You know, my dad was right.

20:11.213 --> 20:13.548
You were awfully quiet
at dinner.

20:13.582 --> 20:16.651
Is... everything okay?

20:16.686 --> 20:18.685
I think I might've made
a mistake.

20:19.187 --> 20:20.755
Oh?

20:23.004 --> 20:25.393
One of the llamas
at the Reserve spat on Adam,

20:25.428 --> 20:28.363
and I got it on video,
as a joke.

20:28.397 --> 20:31.066
I bet he didn't think
that was very funny.

20:31.100 --> 20:32.834
Well, it gets worse.

20:32.868 --> 20:35.537
I accidentally sent the video
to one of the kids at school,

20:35.571 --> 20:38.273
but I swear I didn't send it
on purpose.

20:38.307 --> 20:40.308
Somehow it ended up online,

20:40.342 --> 20:43.411
and now all the kids
are laughing at him.

20:43.446 --> 20:46.381
The worst part is Adam's
running for Class President

20:46.415 --> 20:49.050
and I totally ruined everything
for him.

20:49.085 --> 20:51.286
That's the problem with that
social media, huh?

20:51.320 --> 20:52.687
No one has privacy anymore.

20:52.722 --> 20:55.557
Yeah, sort of like this
conversation.

20:57.860 --> 21:00.028
I know it's none
of my business, but...

21:00.062 --> 21:01.730
what happened to your friend...

21:01.764 --> 21:04.065
might not be the worst thing
in the world.

21:04.100 --> 21:07.302
Listen, everyone likes a story
about a long-shot racehorse

21:07.336 --> 21:09.170
who beats the odds
and wins the race.

21:09.205 --> 21:11.106
I mean, even if the other kids
are laughing at him,

21:11.140 --> 21:12.587
at least they know who he is,
right?

21:12.653 --> 21:16.144
I don't know, maybe your friend could
use this video to his advantage...

21:16.178 --> 21:18.049
to win.

21:38.534 --> 21:40.535
Oohhh...

21:44.974 --> 21:47.075
Oh no!

21:50.880 --> 21:53.548
Uh-oh.

21:53.582 --> 21:56.885
I wanted to say, this...
it's been fun.

21:58.559 --> 22:00.789
And I'm glad you got a chance
to meet Casey.

22:00.823 --> 22:03.525
Yeah. She's...
She's really great.

22:03.559 --> 22:05.627
Yeah.

22:05.661 --> 22:07.862
Well, she's the only one that seems
to be able to put up with me.

22:07.897 --> 22:11.900
Hmm. No, I... I can tell
it's more than that.

22:13.402 --> 22:15.570
I'm happy for you.

22:15.604 --> 22:17.806
And this new rodeo school...

22:17.840 --> 22:20.008
it sounds like you found the perfect
thing to do with your life.

22:20.042 --> 22:23.711
Yeah. Yeah, well,
that has worked out.

22:23.746 --> 22:27.315
I actually got an offer from a
junior college down in Texas.

22:27.349 --> 22:30.251
They want me to be their head
coach for their rodeo team.

22:30.286 --> 22:34.022
Imagine that,
me teaching at college?

22:34.056 --> 22:36.191
Tim, that's an amazing
opportunity.

22:36.225 --> 22:38.526
Yeah, well, I turned it down.

22:38.561 --> 22:42.259
Really. Now why would you
do that?

22:42.932 --> 22:46.100
Things are going so well
with Casey.

22:46.135 --> 22:49.204
There's talk of us moving in.

22:49.238 --> 22:52.907
So... this is my life.

22:52.942 --> 22:56.845
- Well, you seem really happy.
- Yeah, you too.

22:58.314 --> 23:02.183
This whole new life of yours...
Stan and the baby...

23:03.586 --> 23:05.854
It's your dream come true.

23:05.888 --> 23:08.089
Yeah, I'm... a lucky girl.

23:09.491 --> 23:11.960
And you're a lucky guy.

23:11.994 --> 23:13.895
Yeah.

23:15.297 --> 23:18.647
- Well, good night, Tim.
- Night.

23:31.113 --> 23:33.114
Not again!

23:35.117 --> 23:37.886
Hey, Jack, I think I ought
to get back to the ranch

23:37.920 --> 23:39.420
and get started on that
to-do list.

23:39.455 --> 23:42.590
Yeah, all right. Don't forget
about that tub up in the loft.

23:42.625 --> 23:46.327
- Those taps need a new divert...
- Diverter. Yeah, it's on the list.

23:46.362 --> 23:48.029
I promise I'll go
to the hardware store

23:48.063 --> 23:49.564
and get it this afternoon.

23:49.598 --> 23:52.200
All right.
There's one more thing...

23:52.234 --> 23:54.636
I need you
to go into the house

23:54.670 --> 23:57.739
and take a look
for my cell phone.

23:57.773 --> 24:01.209
- Okay.
- And don't be all obvious about it.

24:01.243 --> 24:04.612
Lisa can't know that
I misplaced it... again.

24:04.647 --> 24:06.247
A little bit of trouble
in paradise?

24:06.282 --> 24:08.216
Nah, just do it.

24:15.925 --> 24:17.926
You said Danger's been lazy?

24:17.960 --> 24:21.696
Not exactly lazy,
just kind of average, you know?

24:21.730 --> 24:23.665
Janice said he used to be fast
and eager to win,

24:23.699 --> 24:26.401
but that's not the horse I rode
around the track yesterday.

24:30.157 --> 24:31.463
Are you okay?

24:32.708 --> 24:34.742
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just...

24:34.777 --> 24:36.144
I've been fighting a flu
all week.

24:36.178 --> 24:37.545
I'm okay.

24:37.579 --> 24:38.947
All right. You sure?

24:38.981 --> 24:41.049
Yeah. What about his
coordination?

24:41.083 --> 24:43.685
It's not bad, but it's really
not great either.

24:43.719 --> 24:45.053
Why, what are you thinking?

24:45.087 --> 24:46.487
Well, I'd have to do
a myelogram to be certain,

24:46.522 --> 24:49.090
but it might be a cervical
vertebral malformation.

24:49.124 --> 24:51.826
It can cause a lack of coordination
in the limbs and weakness.

24:51.860 --> 24:53.795
Most people call it
Wobbler's Syndrome.

24:53.829 --> 24:55.363
I know what that is.

24:55.397 --> 24:57.799
He doesn't exactly seem to be
stumbling around though.

24:57.833 --> 24:59.634
It could be a very mild case.

24:59.668 --> 25:01.469
Just enough to affect
his performance.

25:01.503 --> 25:03.404
I'll run some blood work to make
sure it's not something else,

25:03.439 --> 25:06.407
but from what I see,
it points to Wobbler's.

25:06.442 --> 25:10.078
- Hm?
- Well, my vet ruled out Wobbler's.

25:10.112 --> 25:13.548
Uh, Janice, this is Cass...
Dr. Fay.

25:13.582 --> 25:15.550
I asked her to do
a consultation.

25:15.584 --> 25:18.152
Well, that wasn't necessary. I just
had him vetted a few weeks ago.

25:18.187 --> 25:19.988
Well, it's easy to miss
in the early stages.

25:20.022 --> 25:21.422
I won't be able to make
a diagnosis

25:21.457 --> 25:23.224
until I do a myelogram though.

25:23.258 --> 25:25.293
How old are you anyway?
Like twelve?

25:25.327 --> 25:27.729
Excuse me? I did a practicum
down in the States

25:27.763 --> 25:30.031
at a clinic that specializes
in CVM.

25:30.065 --> 25:31.432
I assisted with
several examinations.

25:31.467 --> 25:33.568
I know exactly what to look for.

25:33.602 --> 25:37.150
Well, that's it then.
We're done.

25:38.607 --> 25:40.541
Janice, this isn't the end.

25:40.576 --> 25:42.010
Cassandra's gonna run
some more tests.

25:42.044 --> 25:43.411
You know, maybe it's something
else.

25:43.445 --> 25:44.912
Yeah, well,
she seemed pretty sure.

25:44.947 --> 25:47.081
Okay, well, even if
it is Wobbler's Syndrome,

25:47.116 --> 25:48.783
there's gotta be something
we can do about it.

25:48.817 --> 25:50.818
Treatments or surgery.

25:50.853 --> 25:54.689
Amy, a racehorse with balance
issues is extremely dangerous.

25:54.723 --> 25:57.658
The surgery's expensive and it's
not even guaranteed to work.

25:57.693 --> 25:59.794
If he does have
Wobbler's Syndrome,

25:59.828 --> 26:02.764
I'm gonna have to put him down.

26:06.411 --> 26:08.997
I don't see how I can use
this video to my advantage.

26:09.041 --> 26:10.542
It makes me look like an idiot.

26:10.576 --> 26:13.044
That's not true.
It's actually pretty funny.

26:13.113 --> 26:13.852
It's humiliating.

26:13.931 --> 26:16.181
Only if people think
you're not in on the joke.

26:16.215 --> 26:18.550
Look, Georgie. If you hadn't
recorded it in the first place,

26:18.584 --> 26:20.251
or if you actually knew how
to use a public folder,

26:20.286 --> 26:22.020
none of this would've happened.

26:22.054 --> 26:24.556
I can only say sorry
so many times.

26:24.590 --> 26:26.925
That video is out there
and we can't change that.

26:26.959 --> 26:29.794
So instead of sulking,
let's do something about it.

26:29.829 --> 26:31.496
What're you proposing?

26:31.530 --> 26:33.031
We make another video.

26:33.065 --> 26:34.833
No. No way.

26:34.867 --> 26:37.001
Well, do you wanna win
this election or not?

26:41.741 --> 26:44.709
Caleb, are
you coming to my tea party?

26:44.744 --> 26:46.478
You know what?
Maybe tomorrow, kid.

26:46.512 --> 26:48.480
But it's happening right now.

26:48.514 --> 26:50.448
I'm gonna have to take
a rain check. I'm at work.

26:50.483 --> 26:52.417
I don't have to work.
I'm a princess.

26:52.460 --> 26:53.515
Well la-di-da.

26:53.608 --> 26:56.020
Katie, honey,
maybe you should leave Caleb alone.

26:56.055 --> 26:57.489
'Cause he has a lot of work
to do.

26:57.523 --> 26:59.424
Okay. Come on, Remy.

26:59.458 --> 27:01.192
Thank you.

27:03.662 --> 27:05.830
Can I help you find something?

27:05.865 --> 27:09.300
I was uh... just looking
for Jack's tools.

27:09.335 --> 27:12.404
Have you tried the quonset hut?

27:12.438 --> 27:15.407
I'll do that. Thanks.

27:21.881 --> 27:23.248
So how long are you in town?

27:23.282 --> 27:24.649
Just until tomorrow.

27:24.683 --> 27:27.051
Oh, no, it's on the house.

27:27.086 --> 27:29.988
Oh. Thank you.

27:30.022 --> 27:34.793
You know, I-I gotta say,
Tim seems like a different guy.

27:34.827 --> 27:36.428
In a good way.

27:36.462 --> 27:38.663
My guess is he owes that to you.

27:38.697 --> 27:41.833
Nah, he was pretty
much that way when I found him.

27:41.867 --> 27:44.669
No, I'm serious.
I mean, until last night,

27:44.703 --> 27:47.272
I never thought Tim Fleming was
capable of settling down with anyone.

27:47.306 --> 27:48.807
The Tim I knew would've been
on the first plane to Texas

27:48.841 --> 27:51.309
to take that job.

27:51.343 --> 27:54.479
- What job was that?
- Oh, the-the rodeo school.

27:54.513 --> 27:56.514
The junior college,
head coach of the rodeo team.

27:56.549 --> 27:58.883
Yeah, right. That one.

28:00.386 --> 28:04.155
Anyway, I'm really glad
I got a chance to meet you.

28:04.190 --> 28:06.825
- Me too.
- Take care, Casey.

28:06.859 --> 28:09.260
Take care.

28:17.369 --> 28:19.671
Hey! Did you get everything?

28:19.705 --> 28:23.074
Yeah. My mom was asking
a bunch of questions.

28:23.108 --> 28:25.610
I told her we were doing
an experiment.

28:25.644 --> 28:27.512
I guess we kind of are.

28:27.546 --> 28:30.381
If this doesn't work, I'm gonna be
the laughing stock of Hudson High.

28:30.416 --> 28:32.517
You already are the laughing
stock of Hudson High,

28:32.551 --> 28:34.519
it can't get any worse.

28:34.553 --> 28:36.921
Thanks. That makes me feel
a whole lot better.

28:54.106 --> 28:55.907
- I'm on to you.
- Ah...

28:57.343 --> 28:59.744
You're on to me?
What does that mean?

28:59.778 --> 29:03.047
I left you three messages,
sent you five texts.

29:03.082 --> 29:04.482
And you didn't respond
to any of them

29:04.517 --> 29:06.684
because you lost your phone
again, didn't you?

29:06.719 --> 29:11.259
Okay, I admit,
I may have misplaced it.

29:11.323 --> 29:14.125
But please don't overreact.

29:14.159 --> 29:15.994
I'm not gonna overreact.
But let's admit it,

29:16.028 --> 29:17.662
you hate the phone.

29:17.696 --> 29:20.732
No, I told you, I love it.
I really do.

29:20.766 --> 29:23.034
Well, if that was the case,
you wouldn't keep losing it.

29:23.068 --> 29:25.303
You know what I'm gonna do
the next time I'm in town,

29:25.337 --> 29:28.206
I'm going to buy you an old
fashioned flip phone

29:28.240 --> 29:30.542
and we'll be done with this.

29:32.011 --> 29:34.846
Here, GG. You can have my phone.

29:34.880 --> 29:39.286
Why thank you, honey.

29:39.577 --> 29:43.588
Okay. Let's see how good
this one works.

29:45.124 --> 29:47.325
I don't mean to sound
like such a downer,

29:47.359 --> 29:50.028
but this whole thing with
Danger is driving me crazy.

29:50.062 --> 29:52.130
He's just such a beautiful horse

29:52.164 --> 29:53.731
and the thought of
putting him down...

29:53.766 --> 29:56.534
- Amy? Are you home?
- Um, yup! Come on in.

29:56.569 --> 29:59.237
Hey, Ty, can I call you back?
Cassandra's here.

29:59.271 --> 30:00.872
Okay. Bye.

30:00.906 --> 30:02.273
- Hey!
- Hey.

30:02.308 --> 30:04.075
I hope I'm not catching you
at a bad time.

30:04.109 --> 30:05.877
No, not at all.
Can I get you something?

30:05.911 --> 30:08.079
Uh, no thanks. I just wanted
to drop by and let you know

30:08.113 --> 30:11.015
Janice brought Danger to the
clinic so I could do a myelogram.

30:11.050 --> 30:13.451
I have to send the images in
for confirmation,

30:13.485 --> 30:16.621
but I'm certain it's Wobbler's.

30:18.958 --> 30:21.526
Uh... okay, I should-I should-
I should go.

30:21.560 --> 30:25.063
You just got here.

30:25.097 --> 30:26.598
You really don't look so good.

30:26.632 --> 30:28.633
No, I'm fine.

30:28.667 --> 30:30.134
No, you're not.
Here, have a seat.

30:30.169 --> 30:32.103
I'll get you some water.

30:32.137 --> 30:34.138
Thanks.

30:39.278 --> 30:41.656
How long have you been
feeling sick?

30:42.593 --> 30:45.495
Um... a few days.

30:46.485 --> 30:49.454
I'm tired all the time
and nauseous.

30:51.790 --> 30:55.460
Mostly in the mornings,
every morning.

30:55.494 --> 30:58.153
Oh my God...
You don't think you're...

30:58.192 --> 30:59.907
Pregnant?

31:03.702 --> 31:07.305
I don't know. Maybe.

31:14.787 --> 31:16.421
It's not doing anything.

31:16.455 --> 31:18.790
The pharmacist said the test
takes at least three minutes.

31:18.824 --> 31:21.059
I set an alarm on my phone.

31:22.862 --> 31:26.698
Well, three minutes might
as well be an eternity.

31:26.732 --> 31:28.166
Do you want some tea?

31:28.200 --> 31:30.209
Do you have any wine?

31:30.736 --> 31:32.804
You're right, tea it is.

31:32.838 --> 31:35.306
Why don't we talk
about something else?

31:35.341 --> 31:37.980
You know, to pass the time.

31:38.969 --> 31:42.480
Okay. Um... Let's discuss
treatment options for Danger.

31:42.514 --> 31:45.149
I just... really don't see
much point.

31:45.184 --> 31:47.185
Janice said she's gonna put
the horse down.

31:47.219 --> 31:50.755
Really? That's too bad.

31:50.789 --> 31:53.524
He's a good candidate
for cervical spinal surgery.

31:53.559 --> 31:56.594
If it's done in the early stages
there's a lot of success.

31:56.629 --> 31:57.996
So if a horse has that surgery,

31:58.030 --> 31:59.430
they could go on to race?

31:59.465 --> 32:02.200
Yeah. Scott diagnosed a horse
with Wobbler's two years ago.

32:02.234 --> 32:03.868
The owner went through
with the surgery.

32:03.903 --> 32:05.503
A year later, the horse is back
on the circuit

32:05.537 --> 32:07.338
winning all kinds of races.

32:07.373 --> 32:09.374
Do you think maybe you could
put me in touch with that owner?

32:09.408 --> 32:10.909
I'll get him to call you.

32:14.013 --> 32:16.277
- Time's up?
- Yup.

32:34.566 --> 32:37.435
Huh.

32:37.469 --> 32:40.305
I don't know how
I'm supposed to feel.

32:40.339 --> 32:42.140
I mean, I'm not scared
or anything like that.

32:42.174 --> 32:44.575
I just... I feel kind of numb.

32:46.612 --> 32:48.012
Please don't tell Caleb.

32:48.047 --> 32:50.782
No, of course not.

32:52.098 --> 32:55.086
I've heard that these tests
aren't always a 100% accurate,

32:55.120 --> 32:58.823
so... maybe you should go see
your doctor just to be sure.

33:00.759 --> 33:04.228
Is it okay if I just sit here
for awhile?

33:04.912 --> 33:08.266
- Do you want company?
- Yeah.

33:15.541 --> 33:17.542
Hey...

33:26.285 --> 33:27.652
Hello. I'm Adam Parker

33:27.686 --> 33:29.520
and I'm running to be
your next Class President.

33:29.555 --> 33:31.556
It was Aristotle that said,
"Democracy arises

33:31.590 --> 33:33.024
out of the notion that

33:33.058 --> 33:34.826
those who are equal
in any respect

33:34.860 --> 33:36.627
are equal in all respects;

33:36.662 --> 33:38.096
because men are equally free."

33:38.130 --> 33:41.099
So don't forget to exercise your
democratic rights tomorrow...

33:45.371 --> 33:47.772
by voting for someone who won't
falter in the line of fire.

33:47.806 --> 33:50.908
I'm Adam Parker and I'm your next
Class President.

33:52.344 --> 33:53.745
I'm no Stephen Spielberg,

33:53.779 --> 33:56.647
but I think I nailed
the special effects.

33:56.682 --> 33:58.950
You enjoyed squirting
fake llama spit in my face

33:58.984 --> 34:02.253
- a little too much.
- It was pretty fun.

34:03.722 --> 34:05.390
What if this doesn't work?

34:05.424 --> 34:06.991
What if everyone
just laughs at me?

34:07.026 --> 34:08.793
They're not gonna be laughing
at you,

34:08.827 --> 34:12.530
they're gonna laugh with you...
I hope.

34:13.150 --> 34:14.532
You hope?

34:14.565 --> 34:18.302
That doesn't exactly
instill confidence.

34:18.337 --> 34:20.838
Are we uploading this or not?

34:20.873 --> 34:22.407
Here goes nothing.

34:36.355 --> 34:38.956
Why would I tell you about a job
I had no intention of taking?

34:38.991 --> 34:40.558
Because it's kind of a big deal.

34:40.592 --> 34:42.994
Because people don't just get
offered jobs like that everyday.

34:43.027 --> 34:46.597
- I'm not going to Texas.
- Well, why not?

34:46.632 --> 34:48.366
Because my daughters are here.

34:48.400 --> 34:51.268
My rodeo school's here.

34:53.338 --> 34:55.907
Casey...

34:57.534 --> 34:59.579
you're here.

35:01.413 --> 35:05.483
Look, if we weren't thinking
about moving in together...

35:05.517 --> 35:08.252
if I wasn't in the picture...

35:08.287 --> 35:11.556
would you at least consider
taking that job?

35:11.590 --> 35:14.212
What kind of question is that?

35:16.128 --> 35:17.595
I love you, Tim.

35:17.629 --> 35:21.065
I love everything that
we have together.

35:21.100 --> 35:24.035
But this life that you've
planned for us...

35:24.069 --> 35:26.337
you know, where we settle down
and buy a dog...

35:26.371 --> 35:31.375
I mean, I had that
for twenty years with Hank.

35:33.345 --> 35:37.515
And after he died, I had to
figure out how to be on my own.

35:37.549 --> 35:40.184
And I just started getting
good at it.

35:40.219 --> 35:42.954
What are you saying?

35:49.895 --> 35:52.330
I'm saying that...

35:52.364 --> 35:56.701
I'm afraid of making promises
I might not be able to keep.

36:15.120 --> 36:17.021
His name's Overage.

36:17.055 --> 36:19.891
So far, this season alone,
he's had six starts:

36:19.925 --> 36:22.627
two firsts, three seconds,
and one third.

36:22.661 --> 36:24.695
Impressive.

36:24.730 --> 36:27.198
Overage had cervical spinal
surgery two years ago

36:27.232 --> 36:28.933
to fix his Wobbler's Syndrome.

36:28.967 --> 36:30.935
He made a full recovery

36:30.969 --> 36:32.770
and now he's placing
in the money every time.

36:32.804 --> 36:35.907
Yeah, I kinda figured you
were trying to make a point.

36:35.941 --> 36:38.910
Danger has the same potential.

36:39.700 --> 36:41.078
You're right.

36:41.113 --> 36:43.948
There's a chance Danger
could go on to win races.

36:43.982 --> 36:45.950
But there's an even bigger
chance he won't.

36:45.984 --> 36:49.453
Factor in the surgery costs
and recovery time,

36:49.955 --> 36:51.789
the numbers just don't add up.

36:51.823 --> 36:55.927
So that's all Danger
Is to you? A number?

36:55.961 --> 36:59.964
No, he's not.
It kills me to do this, Amy.

36:59.998 --> 37:02.233
But I'm not gonna mortgage
my entire life on a horse

37:02.267 --> 37:04.769
who might never race again.

37:04.803 --> 37:06.737
I'm sorry.

37:12.028 --> 37:14.045
Thank you.

37:14.079 --> 37:16.547
How did you rope me
into this again?

37:16.582 --> 37:19.083
She wanted you here.

37:19.117 --> 37:21.966
Well, at least
I'm getting paid, right?

37:22.955 --> 37:24.956
Would you like some tea?

37:24.990 --> 37:27.792
What the heck... fill her up.

37:30.896 --> 37:34.332
- Did you hear that?
- Hear what?

37:37.336 --> 37:40.738
No, don't do that, GG!

37:42.574 --> 37:45.076
Oh...

37:52.818 --> 37:57.021
Would you mind telling me
why my phone is under your bed?

37:57.055 --> 37:58.823
Uh-oh...

38:03.517 --> 38:05.630
You're gonna leaving without saying Goodby?

38:06.060 --> 38:07.699
Goodbye, Tim.

38:08.329 --> 38:11.431
I talked to Amy. She filled
me in on all the details.

38:11.465 --> 38:14.935
So I spoke to the local vet,
Scott. You know Scott.

38:14.969 --> 38:18.438
He's going to give you
a heck of deal on the surgery.

38:18.472 --> 38:21.641
- You just call him.
- Tim, you don't understand.

38:21.676 --> 38:24.945
My husband and I were pinning all
of our hopes on Danger this season.

38:24.979 --> 38:26.479
The reason he flew home early

38:26.514 --> 38:28.214
was so he could take
a job interview.

38:28.249 --> 38:31.651
With the government,
if you can believe it.

38:31.686 --> 38:33.920
Danger was our last hope
this year,

38:33.955 --> 38:37.591
and the Wobbler Syndrome was
just the nail in the coffin.

38:37.625 --> 38:39.893
We're gonna have to get
out of the business.

38:39.927 --> 38:41.861
So what're you gonna do?

38:41.896 --> 38:45.409
I don't know. Be a mom, I guess.

38:46.701 --> 38:49.444
Janice, that's never gonna
be enough for you.

38:51.038 --> 38:53.306
I know you. Take the card,
do the surgery.

38:53.341 --> 38:55.108
No, it's too risky.

38:55.142 --> 38:57.911
You're the one that told Georgie

38:57.945 --> 39:00.046
that everyone likes a story
about a long-shot racehorse

39:00.081 --> 39:02.616
that beats the odds.

39:02.650 --> 39:05.819
Danger could be
a hell of a story.

39:05.853 --> 39:07.954
Take this card.

39:11.092 --> 39:13.460
That's the Janice I know.

39:13.494 --> 39:17.030
- I must be crazy.
- You're brave.

39:17.064 --> 39:19.699
That's one thing I always loved
about you.

39:25.706 --> 39:28.174
I gotta go. Good luck.

39:28.209 --> 39:30.744
Hey, Tim?

39:30.778 --> 39:33.680
You know, while we're being
honest with each other,

39:33.714 --> 39:36.282
I like Casey a lot.

39:36.317 --> 39:38.852
But you turning that job down
to play house with her,

39:38.886 --> 39:40.687
that's not you either.

39:41.912 --> 39:44.524
- People change.
- Do they?

39:52.700 --> 39:54.768
- Anything yet?
- No.

39:54.802 --> 39:58.171
Keep refreshing the page. They're
supposed to post it any minute now.

40:05.846 --> 40:07.647
Wait. Here it is.

40:07.682 --> 40:09.549
What? What does it say?

40:09.583 --> 40:11.851
- You won!
- I won?!

40:11.886 --> 40:13.285
- Yeah, you won!
- Are you serious?

40:13.348 --> 40:14.266
Yeah!

40:14.319 --> 40:16.423
Hey, Adam!
I totally voted for you, man.

40:16.457 --> 40:18.358
You're hilarious.

40:18.392 --> 40:21.961
Hey, everybody, look!
It's llama boy! Woo!

40:21.996 --> 40:26.032
Llama boy! Llama boy!
Llama boy! Llama boy!

40:27.702 --> 40:30.637
Llama boy! Llama boy! Llama boy!
Llama boy!

40:42.149 --> 40:44.784
So Katie's having
a little time out.

40:44.819 --> 40:48.121
Hm. Well, at least the phone
is repairable.

40:48.155 --> 40:51.257
Amy agreed to come by
and babysit,

40:51.292 --> 40:54.227
so I'm taking you out
for dinner.

40:56.430 --> 40:58.465
I accuse you of something
you didn't do,

40:58.499 --> 41:00.934
and you take me out to dinner.
How does that work?

41:00.968 --> 41:04.370
Well, see, I'm taking you
to that steak house

41:04.405 --> 41:06.940
that has the all-you-can-eat
salad bar

41:06.974 --> 41:09.576
and they give you steaks
as big as your plate.

41:09.610 --> 41:12.078
- I hate that place.
- Yes you do.

41:12.113 --> 41:15.281
And... you're buying.

41:15.909 --> 41:20.204
Oh yes. I see how that works.

41:57.825 --> 42:03.120
Yeah. Billy? Hey, Billy.
Yeah, it's Tim.

42:04.098 --> 42:06.566
Yeah, I'm good.

42:06.600 --> 42:09.769
Uh, yeah. No, Billy, listen.

42:09.804 --> 42:11.337
I think I might have been
a little hasty

42:11.372 --> 42:13.973
turning down that job.

42:14.453 --> 42:15.575
Yeah.

42:15.609 --> 42:18.444
Well, I think I'd like
to take you up on your offer.

42:18.479 --> 42:22.731
You know, to come down,
see the campus, meet the guys.

42:23.584 --> 42:24.779
Yup.

42:26.187 --> 42:27.543
All right.

42:29.490 --> 42:30.583
All right.

42:30.657 --> 42:32.852
Yup. Well, I'll see you
in Dallas.

42:34.195 --> 42:37.564
Okay. Okay. Good. Bye.

42:42.773 --> 42:45.071
Well, the diverter won't
take long to install.

42:45.105 --> 42:46.873
Okay. Can I offer you a beer
or something?

42:46.907 --> 42:48.341
Have I ever said no
to a free beer?

42:48.375 --> 42:50.710
No.

42:50.744 --> 42:52.212
Here you go. I'm gonna be
down in the barn,

42:52.246 --> 42:54.480
- so just holler if you need me.
- Thanks.

43:24.311 --> 43:28.268
Oh wow, Amy's pregnant.

43:32.373 --> 43:33.506
On the next Heartland...

43:33.548 --> 43:34.854
If she hasn't told you yet,

43:34.856 --> 43:36.556
she must be wanting
to make it a surprise.

43:36.558 --> 43:38.224
Is there something else
you want to talk about?

43:38.226 --> 43:39.058
No.

43:39.060 --> 43:39.893
Just be careful, okay?

43:39.895 --> 43:41.561
Are you sure
that she's pregnant?

43:41.563 --> 43:43.296
Okay this is crazy,
I'm just going to ask her.

43:43.298 --> 43:44.197
Bad idea, man.

43:44.199 --> 43:47.131
Heartland,
