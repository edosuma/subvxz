Tonight there's a big event at the Dyad.
Rachel will be there.

00:20.120 --> 00:22.088
How do you get next to Rachel with Daniel in the way?

00:22.155 --> 00:24.919
Rachel's a very busy woman
but if you tell me where you are,

00:24.992 --> 00:25.981
I'll bring you to her.

00:26.093 --> 00:27.082
Who in the hell are you?

This is our mistake.

I want my daughter.
If you don't have her, you're dead!

Not the Dyad people, somebody else took Kira.

00:39.873 --> 00:44.242
I know. The cowboy who took the shotgun

04:07.080 --> 04:08.513

We're going to take five, and I mean five.

14:23.996 --> 14:25.827
Carter, no more sobbing.

14:26.232 --> 14:27.221
Alison, please.

14:27.834 --> 14:28.926
Okay.

14:30.002 --> 14:32.300
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

14:32.405 --> 14:33.463
- Here.
- Mmm-hmm.

14:33.606 --> 14:37.167
- Okay, now, do you feel that?
- Mmm-hmm.

14:37.243 --> 14:40.440
That is you breathing very high.

14:41.080 --> 14:43.048
- Yes.
- That's anxiety residue.

14:43.316 --> 14:45.648
- Okay.
- What you want to do

14:45.718 --> 14:48.585
is you want to breathe from here,

14:48.688 --> 14:49.950
- from the sacrum.
- What?

14:50.056 --> 14:52.217
From the sacrum to the diaphragm and out.

14:52.325 --> 14:54.156
- Let's do it, okay?
- Are you sure that's my sacrum?

14:54.227 --> 14:57.287
- No, right. Feel it right here, and in.
- (INHALES)

14:57.363 --> 15:00.059
- And out...
- Out.

15:01.567 --> 15:02.864
- In.
- Excuse me.

15:03.136 --> 15:05.502
- And out...
- Ah! Thank god!

15:06.005 --> 15:08.439
Sarah, everybody, this is Felix, my acting coach.

15:08.508 --> 15:10.442
Hello, you all look wonderful.

15:10.510 --> 15:12.444
Hi, I'm Alexander, I'm the director.

15:12.512 --> 15:14.309
Yes, I've seen where that hand's been.

15:14.414 --> 15:17.315
Okay, let's just go.
We'll be right back, thank you.

15:18.451 --> 15:20.783
Donnie is your husband, Aynsley is your monitor.

15:20.887 --> 15:23.151
- No. No, I was wrong.
- Yes!

15:23.256 --> 15:24.917
I was wrong, Felix.

15:24.991 --> 15:27.551
Vague text messages.
They don"t prove anything.

15:27.627 --> 15:29.959
You have a history of jumping to monitor conclusions.

15:30.563 --> 15:31.962
What have I done?

15:37.203 --> 15:39.068
Aynsley's dead.

15:40.673 --> 15:41.662
I'm sorry, what?

15:41.808 --> 15:44.800
There was an, uh, an accident with her garbage disposal.

15:45.478 --> 15:47.946
Her scarf got caught and...

15:49.048 --> 15:50.515
she choked to death.

15:51.117 --> 15:52.106
Oh, my god!

15:52.185 --> 15:57.122
And I was there. I watched it happen,
Felix. I didn"t do anything about it.

15:57.190 --> 15:59.317
Shh. Okay, okay, look.

15:59.392 --> 16:00.723
- Are you joking?
- No!

16:00.793 --> 16:02.693
- No?
- No, no, no. I thought it was her.

16:02.762 --> 16:04.127
We all did. We...

16:04.831 --> 16:07.959
- It was Donnie all along.
- Okay.

16:08.034 --> 16:10.025
- I killed Aynsley.
- No, no, darling.

16:10.136 --> 16:12.434
- Yes, I did, yes.
- No. Well...

16:13.039 --> 16:16.372
I mean, not really, you know, just, like, hardly.

16:16.442 --> 16:18.933
Oh, god, you can't tell Sarah, please.

16:19.045 --> 16:20.603
You can't tell anybody.

16:20.680 --> 16:22.944
(STAMMERING) I can't...
I can't go to jail, oh, my god.

16:23.049 --> 16:24.083
I have two children. I can't...

16:24.116 --> 16:26.641
Nobody's going tojail, okay?
No one's going to jail.

16:26.853 --> 16:30.516
Wejust need to prove that Donnie <i>'</i> s really your monitor.

16:30.857 --> 16:31.824
How?

16:32.625 --> 16:35.719
I mean, he's bamboozled me for all of these years.

16:35.828 --> 16:38.092
He is very good at being evil.

16:38.164 --> 16:40.598
Yes. Yes, he is, terribly.

16:40.666 --> 16:42.759
So here's what we do. We set a trap.

16:43.035 --> 16:46.562
Give him some monitorish information
and see if he reacts like a monitor.

16:46.639 --> 16:48.300
- Uh-huh.
- Okay.

16:49.375 --> 16:51.309
Got any ideas or you just want to keep drinking?

16:51.410 --> 16:54.243
I think I need to keep drinking
for a while and then I'll have an idea.

16:56.816 --> 16:58.477
I made things worse, Siobhan...

16:59.519 --> 17:01.487
- Why didn't you call me?
- I couldn't trust the phones.

17:01.988 --> 17:05.287
There was more than one person watching
the house, I knew someone was coming,

17:05.358 --> 17:08.759
so I tossed the place. I made it look
like an abduction to confuse the issue.

17:08.828 --> 17:10.420
I put Kira first.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.054
You think I didn't?

17:18.371 --> 17:19.804
Hey, I know this place.

17:21.406 --> 17:24.103
This is where we landed when we left the UK.

17:38.324 --> 17:40.485
Hello, Sarah, welcome back.

17:41.827 --> 17:42.816
Barry.

17:43.996 --> 17:45.861
The birdwatchers.

17:45.965 --> 17:47.227
My old network.

17:47.333 --> 17:51.167
They helped us disappear once.
They're helping again.

17:53.406 --> 17:55.704
Well, look at you.

17:56.876 --> 17:58.605
Brenda, yeah?

17:58.678 --> 18:00.703
Yeah, she remembers.

18:00.813 --> 18:01.802
Well done.

18:02.014 --> 18:04.414
Such a beauty and all grown up.

18:04.483 --> 18:06.474
- I wouldn <i>'</i> t say either.
- Oh.

18:07.520 --> 18:08.748
Mommy!

18:10.690 --> 18:12.681
Monkey! Come here!

18:14.927 --> 18:18.294
Oh, I was so worried about you.
I didn't know where you were.

18:18.831 --> 18:21.766
- We came to the birdwatchers.
- I know.

18:23.436 --> 18:25.028
Are you all right?

18:26.772 --> 18:28.433
Are you sure?

18:29.275 --> 18:30.799
Come on inside.

18:31.711 --> 18:33.838
I know I could use a drink.

18:34.847 --> 18:36.610
Could have answered your phone.

18:36.716 --> 18:38.206
ART: What's the point?

18:38.284 --> 18:42.084
I don't know, quash the wild rumours
you're about to get suspended?

18:42.154 --> 18:43.951
Union rep's on it.

18:44.056 --> 18:45.045
No.

18:48.527 --> 18:50.757
So, what, I got to beat it out of you?

18:50.830 --> 18:52.627
What the hell happened?

18:54.367 --> 18:57.336
You know that lawyer?
The real connected one?

18:57.403 --> 19:00.065
Pulled the rug out from under us
during the Sarah Manning thing?

19:00.172 --> 19:02.470
Well, we crossed paths

19:02.575 --> 19:03.906
and words were exchanged.

19:04.010 --> 19:05.910
He <i>'</i> s the one trying to get you suspended?

19:06.512 --> 19:08.275
I got something that might help.

19:08.347 --> 19:09.871
You know Carp, the patrol guy?

19:09.949 --> 19:13.077
Mentioned he's got the weirdest Jane Doe in hospital.

19:19.191 --> 19:20.886
- Holy shit.
- Yeah.

19:21.227 --> 19:23.161
That's what, like, number five?

19:25.765 --> 19:27.357
Don't go there, Angie.

19:27.433 --> 19:28.923
Just drop it.

19:29.001 --> 19:31.629
Alison Hendrix...
Just drop the whole thing.

19:31.737 --> 19:35.070
But you're getting screwed, Art.
And what aboutjustice for Beth?

19:35.174 --> 19:38.041
Look, I'm serious. Leave it alone.

19:41.047 --> 19:43.311
- You're not going there.
- Not going there.

19:44.517 --> 19:46.251
I'm here about the Jane Doe that came in last night,

19:46.285 --> 19:47.274
the gunshot vic?

19:47.353 --> 19:49.321
Sure, she's right down here.

19:55.494 --> 19:57.223
Where'd she go?

19:57.630 --> 19:59.427
(SIGHS)
You're kidding.

20:05.838 --> 20:06.964
Who are you?

20:08.407 --> 20:09.465
Family.

20:17.450 --> 20:19.281
Nervous, Gracie?

20:21.287 --> 20:22.777
It's not usual, is it?

20:23.522 --> 20:26.685
I'm sure we seem as strange to them as they do to us.

20:27.960 --> 20:29.518
Just do as your father says.

20:52.685 --> 20:53.947
Hello, Gracie.

20:56.655 --> 20:58.088
Will it eat?

20:59.291 --> 21:00.918
Of course she will.

21:00.993 --> 21:03.018
Come on, Gracie, don't be scared.

21:03.129 --> 21:04.721
She needs our care.

21:04.797 --> 21:06.526
And we need her trust.

21:12.071 --> 21:13.595
(MAN GRUNTING)

21:26.452 --> 21:27.783
Forgive me.

21:28.487 --> 21:29.852
An old custom.

21:33.025 --> 21:34.287
Hello, Tomas.

21:34.360 --> 21:38.820
I am so grateful to your family
for my rescue and for hers.

21:38.931 --> 21:43.061
I found myself praying for her soul.

21:43.169 --> 21:46.229
- Well, that's not so crazy, is it?
- Abominations have no soul.

21:46.572 --> 21:51.703
Though one could easily mistake the
bullet missing her heart for a miracle.

21:52.311 --> 21:55.872
It is a miracle, my friend. Your charge

21:57.316 --> 21:58.715
has a genetic anomaly.

22:00.085 --> 22:01.677
She's a mirror.

22:02.188 --> 22:04.986
See, her internal organs are all reversed.

22:05.424 --> 22:06.413
What?

22:07.793 --> 22:10.785
It's a condition that, uh,

22:10.896 --> 22:13.126
sometimes occurs with identical twins.

22:13.332 --> 22:16.130
Kind of a yin-yang sort of thing.

22:17.369 --> 22:21.100
One of them's right-handed.
One of them's left-handed.

22:23.242 --> 22:25.642
One of them has her heart on the left side

22:27.413 --> 22:29.347
and one of them has their heart...

22:30.749 --> 22:32.717
Her heart is on the wrong side.

22:33.352 --> 22:35.149
This is surely the mark of corruption.

22:35.254 --> 22:37.745
Yeah, well, that's where I disagree with you.

22:37.990 --> 22:41.187
You see, I steered my faith through science at MIT

22:41.293 --> 22:42.317
and what I see here...

22:43.529 --> 22:45.997
What I see here is God opening a whole new door.

22:46.799 --> 22:49.063
But what you see is not who she is.

22:49.168 --> 22:54.697
Your new order should appreciate
this wretch is not merely an affront,

22:55.040 --> 22:58.168
she is the war for the future of creation.

23:02.248 --> 23:04.239
I got no argument with you there.

23:04.950 --> 23:06.850
You're welcome here, Tomas, both of you,

23:07.086 --> 23:09.520
for as long as it takes her to recover.

23:15.895 --> 23:19.456
Hey look, that's where Uncle Felix bashed his head open.

23:19.732 --> 23:23.065
Thanks to his foster sister who was
helping him down the stairs head first.

23:23.335 --> 23:24.529
He asked for it.

23:24.603 --> 23:25.837
We don't get many through these days,

23:25.905 --> 23:28.396
but we could still kit out an army if we had to.

23:28.574 --> 23:30.474
All sizes and shapes.

23:31.110 --> 23:35.740
- Mrs S says I have your old bed.
- Yeah, I think you do.

23:37.116 --> 23:39.880
Look, that's me and that's Uncle Felix.

23:50.296 --> 23:51.991
Oh, Marjorie, that's horrible.

23:52.197 --> 23:56.065
But I can't, I can't today.
No, absolutely not.

23:56.368 --> 23:58.893
Now, make it sound all dire, you know?

23:59.004 --> 24:00.904
And, oh, mention Sarah.

24:01.006 --> 24:02.496
We're all obsessed with Sarah.

24:02.608 --> 24:04.371
<i>No, not even an emergency.</i>

24:04.443 --> 24:08.402
I can't talk to Sarah. I can <i>'</i> t.
That's not my business.

24:08.747 --> 24:10.146
<i>Now set the hook.</i>

24:10.249 --> 24:12.342
I absolutely cannot do it today.

24:12.518 --> 24:14.748
No, no. Fine.

24:17.489 --> 24:19.013
Looking good, Teddy.

24:19.692 --> 24:20.750
Do you need a stretch?

24:21.961 --> 24:24.896
I need to go out.
It's absolutely essential.

24:42.614 --> 24:44.013
I followed her to the cemetery.

24:44.416 --> 24:47.283
You said to call if she had contact
with a Sarah someone, right?

24:47.953 --> 24:50.513
Manning. Sarah Manning.

24:50.589 --> 24:51.681
<i>I don't know who that is.</i>

24:51.890 --> 24:54.017
Oh... Here comes someone.

24:56.795 --> 24:58.228
Yeah, someone's coming, hang on.

24:58.530 --> 25:00.054
Alison.

25:00.432 --> 25:02.024
Sarah, hi.

25:02.134 --> 25:04.261
Oh, honey, look at you. You're shaking.

25:04.403 --> 25:05.427
Oh.

25:06.638 --> 25:09.766
Really nice of you to come by on such short notice.

25:09.842 --> 25:11.002
Of course I came.

25:11.977 --> 25:13.035
It's a lot, eh?

25:13.545 --> 25:17.140
Aynsley passing and taking over her role.

25:18.317 --> 25:19.341
Okay, I'm back.

25:19.585 --> 25:21.177
It's Sarah Stubbs.

25:21.987 --> 25:23.079
Who's that?

25:23.756 --> 25:25.280
She's in the play with Alison.

25:29.428 --> 25:30.952
Wasn't that...

25:31.997 --> 25:33.328
My husband.

25:34.733 --> 25:38.260
Uh, I don't know her very well
but she's probably early 30s,

25:38.370 --> 25:40.304
I guess you'd say plus-size?

25:40.406 --> 25:43.273
Donald, stop talking.

25:43.375 --> 25:44.967
<i>That's not the right Sarah.</i>

25:45.044 --> 25:48.070
Okay, well, then, what do you want me to do now?

25:48.147 --> 25:49.944
<i>Hang up, Donnie.</i>

25:50.549 --> 25:51.607
Hello?

25:53.652 --> 25:54.846
Oh!

25:55.954 --> 25:58.980
- Alison.
- Hello, Donnie.

25:59.324 --> 26:02.225
Uh, I guess you're wondering, um...

26:02.895 --> 26:03.884
Hmm?

26:04.730 --> 26:05.958
Honey...

26:07.066 --> 26:08.465
You haven't even cried yet.

26:08.734 --> 26:11.862
I knew you were coming here,
to see Aynsley. I was worried.

26:11.970 --> 26:14.700
Worried? That I might...

26:14.807 --> 26:16.468
do something drastic?

26:17.242 --> 26:18.709
To myself?

26:19.812 --> 26:20.801
To you?

26:22.448 --> 26:23.915
I was just worried.

26:26.285 --> 26:28.276
Would you like to join us?

26:31.857 --> 26:33.757
No, um...

26:33.826 --> 26:36.317
- You be with your friend. I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

26:37.129 --> 26:38.426
I love you.

26:47.840 --> 26:50.604
She's not used to being cooped up.

26:50.676 --> 26:52.109
Yeah, that makes two of us.

26:52.678 --> 26:54.839
So, what were you planning to do with her?

26:54.913 --> 26:56.005
Before I showed up?

26:57.916 --> 26:59.713
I've organised drivers, booked two flights

26:59.785 --> 27:01.309
on the red-eye to London tonight.

27:02.321 --> 27:03.982
London's where this all started.

27:05.524 --> 27:07.958
Will you follow? You and Fe?

27:08.527 --> 27:12.395
They're for me and Kira, Sarah.
You and Felix can stay here with Brenda.

27:13.599 --> 27:15.191
When it's safe, I'll organise to bring you,

27:15.267 --> 27:17.565
there are people in the UK I haven't seen in a long time,

27:17.636 --> 27:19.661
- people with answers.
- She's my daughter.

27:20.005 --> 27:22.997
And your next move is what, exactly?
Because so far,

27:23.075 --> 27:25.043
you've done a piss-poor job
of keeping her safe.

27:25.511 --> 27:26.842
Yeah...

27:26.912 --> 27:28.345
It's all my fault, yeah?

27:28.447 --> 27:29.436
No.

27:29.681 --> 27:32.445
No, but it is your reality.

27:33.552 --> 27:37.386
And my care of Kira has always
been bulletproof, has it not?

27:46.798 --> 27:47.924
What is this?

27:50.836 --> 27:52.235
Project LEDA?

27:54.072 --> 27:55.699
Well, you clearly know something I don't.

27:56.108 --> 27:57.871
Amelia gave that to me.

27:58.477 --> 27:59.910
Well, what does she say it is?

28:00.012 --> 28:01.479
She warned me about you.

28:02.814 --> 28:05.977
As she died of a stab wound from Helena.

28:08.153 --> 28:10.519
She put you with these people.

28:11.190 --> 28:12.817
I'm sorry, Sarah.

28:14.193 --> 28:18.391
I'm very sorry but I swear to you,
I don't know who they are.

28:23.168 --> 28:25.033
MRS S: Brenda, you've outdone yourself.

28:25.137 --> 28:29.005
It's nice to feed a proper pack again.

28:30.842 --> 28:32.503
To safe travels.

28:32.611 --> 28:34.101
Mmm-hmm.

28:37.849 --> 28:39.476
Brenda used to run strike kitchens

28:39.551 --> 28:41.382
on nothing more than scrap meat and canned veg.

28:41.486 --> 28:44.250
I tried to keep Siobhan in the kitchen,

28:44.323 --> 28:47.554
but she preferred scrubbing Kalashnikovs to pots and pans.

28:48.493 --> 28:50.552
What kind of strikers need machineguns?

28:51.830 --> 28:54.128
I was on guns for funds.

28:54.766 --> 28:59.066
Running weapons to finance freedom,
it made a lot of sense at the time.

28:59.204 --> 29:03.038
Not particularly effective but good times.

29:03.108 --> 29:04.871
Then we lost Jamie.

29:08.013 --> 29:09.037
Who's Jamie?

29:10.048 --> 29:11.413
Jamie's my dad.

29:13.085 --> 29:15.349
There's always a high price to pay for righting wrongs.

29:20.192 --> 29:23.184
Does this extractor fan even work?

29:23.762 --> 29:25.559
- Uh...
- That's okay, we'll get it fixed.

29:25.631 --> 29:26.620
Right.

29:28.533 --> 29:31.400
You making, like, a shopping list for me?

29:31.470 --> 29:32.698
I am.

29:35.274 --> 29:38.641
Okay, chill zone up here.

29:38.710 --> 29:41.508
- With, like, a Persian rug.
- (CHUCKLES)

29:41.647 --> 29:44.844
And this really nice leather couch.

29:44.916 --> 29:48.784
Hang on, does a gene chip system
make a two-channel array moot?

29:50.088 --> 29:51.282
Moot?

29:52.591 --> 29:54.115

29:54.893 --> 29:56.360
You're so cute.

30:05.570 --> 30:07.765
Well, so much for security.

30:12.544 --> 30:14.944
Hello. Rachel Duncan.

30:16.748 --> 30:18.113
You sure are.

30:18.650 --> 30:21.983
Uh, I'm Cosima. The real Cosima,

30:22.087 --> 30:25.318
not the one who kicked your ass or whatever.

30:25.791 --> 30:27.349
Got to love concealer.

30:27.693 --> 30:29.092
I hear you're very clever.

30:29.294 --> 30:30.761
Yeah, I was clever when I was like six.

30:31.330 --> 30:33.457
Dr Cormier, now that we've met,

30:33.565 --> 30:35.624
you'll need to sign a new confidentiality agreement.

30:35.734 --> 30:36.826
Would you leave us, please?

30:37.035 --> 30:38.593
Yes, of course.

30:47.279 --> 30:48.746
So,

30:49.681 --> 30:50.943
you're gay.

30:52.551 --> 30:55.520
My sexuality's not the most interesting thing about me.

30:57.989 --> 30:59.149
How are you feeling?

31:01.226 --> 31:04.320
These are the results of your last medical tests.

31:05.097 --> 31:06.394
What tests?

31:07.199 --> 31:10.362
You visited your university GP two weeks ago.

31:10.435 --> 31:11.993
Blood tests.

31:12.404 --> 31:16.170
You have a high lymphocide count,
along with high CRP and ESR.

31:16.508 --> 31:19.705
You were aware of Katja Obinger"s
undiagnosed condition, yes?

31:21.313 --> 31:23.747
- Yeah.
- Here's the data.

31:23.849 --> 31:25.248
Redacted to the pertinent.

31:25.717 --> 31:28.982
It's in our best interests to eliminate
genetic predisposition.

31:29.287 --> 31:32.586
Um, then you should let me examine the original genome.

31:32.691 --> 31:34.420
Oh, that's not possible.

31:35.360 --> 31:36.384
Why not?

31:36.495 --> 31:39.464
I assure you, the original DNA was robust.

31:40.265 --> 31:42.927
We believe RSUs stem from the cloning procedure.

31:43.468 --> 31:45.800
Dr Cormier will schedule you an MRI.

31:46.905 --> 31:49.567
And here's something else I'd like you to engage with.

31:50.776 --> 31:53.438
Here's what little we know of Sarah Manning's upbringing

31:53.512 --> 31:55.002
and environment.

31:55.914 --> 31:58.610
And here's her sequenced genome.

32:00.185 --> 32:02.779
I want you to tell me why she's different than we are.

32:03.155 --> 32:06.921
You mean, why she of all of us can have a child?

32:10.896 --> 32:12.989
Do make yourself at home.

32:29.114 --> 32:30.877
Why does he need to take it outside?

32:30.949 --> 32:32.780

Okay, come on. Come on.

33:21.333 --> 33:23.164
Should I put my pyjamas on?

33:24.135 --> 33:26.365
Depends what you have to tell me.

33:29.975 --> 33:31.067
What's wrong?

33:32.377 --> 33:34.311
What did you show Mrs S outside?

33:38.116 --> 33:41.051
That. Why?

33:41.486 --> 33:45.149
That's Amelia's. I saw it
when she was snooping in her stuff.

33:50.729 --> 33:53.527
Why was Mrs S snooping in her stuff?

33:58.203 --> 34:02.401
I bet Mrs S has loads of secrets.
Some of them are good, yeah?

34:02.874 --> 34:04.967
Maybe, but I don't think so.

34:07.913 --> 34:10.404
- We should go.
- Yeah.

34:14.585 --> 34:15.917
We're on hold.

34:16.922 --> 34:18.389
If there's trouble, I need to know.

34:18.590 --> 34:21.559
Barry? Is there trouble?

34:22.827 --> 34:26.853

- Usual delays.

35:07.706 --> 35:09.003
Well, we'll change the route.
