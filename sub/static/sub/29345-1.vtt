WEBVTT

00:01.435 --> 00:03.237
I'll see you at the lake.

00:03.904 --> 00:04.905
(gasps)

00:12.012 --> 00:13.114
(motors revving)

00:13.214 --> 00:16.784
ANNOUNCER: FX presents Mayans.

00:19.520 --> 00:20.721
- Last season
on "Mayans M.C."...

00:20.821 --> 00:22.590
- He ever talk to you
about Mom or any of that?

00:22.690 --> 00:24.225
- Mom! Mom!

00:25.393 --> 00:28.262
- Drop it! Drop it!

00:28.362 --> 00:29.863
- Hold it right there!

00:29.963 --> 00:31.532
- Get down on your knees!

00:31.632 --> 00:33.934
- You killed a cop,
and it was a gift.

00:34.034 --> 00:36.204
- What I signed up for was
fitting you into la Galindo.

00:36.304 --> 00:38.072
The day the DEA has enough
to move on that cartel

00:38.172 --> 00:39.273
is the day that I walk away.

00:41.509 --> 00:42.976
- You lied to me!

00:43.077 --> 00:46.080
My own baby brother
fucking betrayed me!

00:48.716 --> 00:51.652
- My real name
is Ignacio Cortina.

00:51.752 --> 00:55.456
My partner and I,
we did some very bad things.

00:55.556 --> 00:57.325
With some very bad people.

00:57.425 --> 00:58.459
- Pop.

00:58.559 --> 00:59.827
- The U.S. Attorney's Office

00:59.927 --> 01:03.564
coerced me
into the same type of deal

01:03.664 --> 01:06.167
they made my father sign
nearly ten years ago.

01:06.267 --> 01:09.069
- Here's the deal:
we reinstate balance.

01:09.170 --> 01:11.105
We'll also supply
manpower and weapons

01:11.205 --> 01:13.107
to crush Los Olvidados.

01:13.207 --> 01:16.076
- What the U.S. and Mexican
authorities don't know

01:16.177 --> 01:18.679
is that someone else
offered me a deal.

01:18.779 --> 01:21.149
- Please sit.

01:21.249 --> 01:24.852
- My organization is no longer
at odds with Los Olvidados.

01:24.952 --> 01:26.787
- Galindo will continue
doing business with them,

01:26.887 --> 01:28.322
keep it looking real.

01:28.422 --> 01:30.691
- And Sam Crow
can supply the cartel.

01:30.791 --> 01:32.960
- Through us.
Feds'll have no idea.

01:33.060 --> 01:34.862
- Primo, need to talk to you.

01:34.962 --> 01:36.464
Galindo and I discussed
a lot of things

01:36.564 --> 01:38.866
on the way back last night.

01:38.966 --> 01:41.602
- Marcus...

01:41.702 --> 01:42.803
- Thank you.

01:42.903 --> 01:44.605
- I come here
with an opportunity.

01:44.705 --> 01:48.176
You help with this,
and you will be free and clear.

01:48.276 --> 01:50.144
- We'll do whatever this thing
for Potter is,

01:50.244 --> 01:51.545
put it behind us.

01:51.645 --> 01:52.846
- You tell Bishop you're done,

01:52.946 --> 01:55.483
hand in your cut,
and you leave.

01:55.583 --> 01:56.784
- Fre--
- Oh, no!

01:56.884 --> 01:57.985
Ugh!

01:59.820 --> 02:02.323
- Execute command 9-2-9.

02:04.758 --> 02:06.894
- That's it?
- That's it.

02:06.994 --> 02:09.230
- My brother talked to you.
- Yeah.

02:09.330 --> 02:11.131
Your brother asked me
to sponsor him.

02:11.232 --> 02:13.967
Said the family shit
was fucking with both of you.

02:14.067 --> 02:16.370
- We had a deal,
and you're gonna fucking do it.

02:16.470 --> 02:19.473
- No. This shit,
this shit I've earned.

02:24.011 --> 02:26.847
- Drop it! Drop it!

02:41.762 --> 02:43.331
Vámonos.
- Vámonos!

04:53.361 --> 04:54.862
- Lighten up, Boy Scout.

04:54.962 --> 04:57.498
Ain't no fun
if it can't kill you.

05:26.927 --> 05:28.762
- Vamos, vamos.

06:04.498 --> 06:06.700
- Angel, no!

06:08.969 --> 06:10.103
- EZ?

06:11.472 --> 06:12.973
Let's go.

06:35.696 --> 06:37.230
- How was the trip?
- It was good.

06:37.330 --> 06:38.632
- Good.

06:39.633 --> 06:41.234
- Hey.

07:05.358 --> 07:07.861
- These are
the last of them.

07:07.961 --> 07:10.030
Contractor just
walked me through it.

07:10.130 --> 07:12.500
Jesus.

07:12.600 --> 07:14.935
Why so many change orders?

07:15.035 --> 07:17.270
- We didn't know how much
of the plumbing was destroyed.

07:17.370 --> 07:19.973
Fire ruined all of it.
Had to be gutted.

07:20.073 --> 07:22.876
All new copper.

07:22.976 --> 07:25.879
- Like a phoenix.

07:25.979 --> 07:30.518
- Creating a mythical bird
probably be cheaper.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.522
- I'll get these
to the business office.

07:34.622 --> 07:35.956
- Mm.

07:36.056 --> 07:37.558
- Are you late?

07:37.658 --> 07:38.859
- More than likely.

07:38.959 --> 07:40.460
- Mexico?

07:40.561 --> 07:42.663
- Not sure.

07:42.763 --> 07:44.364
- Can you let
me know, please?

07:44.464 --> 07:47.000
- Yes.

07:47.100 --> 07:49.369
You'll check on Mom?
- Mm-hmm.

08:09.322 --> 08:12.225
- Who took the bad shots?

08:12.325 --> 08:14.494
- Three white dudes,
same block,

08:14.595 --> 08:17.765
State Prison Tucson,
only one affiliated.

08:17.865 --> 08:19.099
- We pulled the product.

08:19.199 --> 08:21.935
It was stepped on a lot:
fentanyl, speed.

08:22.035 --> 08:25.906
Whatever killed those junkies
came from us.

08:26.740 --> 08:29.543
- 80% of the heroin
Galindo's pushing

08:29.643 --> 08:30.878
from this rebel shadow place

08:30.978 --> 08:33.280
feeding this
new Arizona pipeline.

08:33.380 --> 08:34.548
We lose it,
it fucks up everything.

08:34.648 --> 08:35.783
That can't happen.

08:35.883 --> 08:37.450
- Ah.

08:39.252 --> 08:40.220
- Give us the room.

08:55.135 --> 08:58.606
Internal shit like this,

08:58.706 --> 08:59.940
wish Alvarez
was still in this seat.

09:01.575 --> 09:03.243
- I'm sure he'd weigh in
if we asked.

09:03.343 --> 09:05.979
- It's not his problem anymore.
- No, it's not.

09:06.079 --> 09:08.949
It's ours now,
so let's not fuck it up.

09:10.918 --> 09:14.487
Tucson, Sahuarita, and Tempe,
we make the drops,

09:14.588 --> 09:15.789
see who turns blue.

09:15.889 --> 09:18.325
- Agreed.
- Agreed.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.164
- Reach out to the school.

09:24.264 --> 09:25.666
Have the prospect
do his thing.

09:25.766 --> 09:28.335
- Yeah.

09:28.435 --> 09:30.303
We hear from Angel?
- Yeah.

09:30.403 --> 09:31.905
They already set up
the generators,

09:32.005 --> 09:33.473
and now they're
handing out supplies.

09:33.573 --> 09:34.642
Saint's on her way.

09:35.609 --> 09:37.144
- Good.

09:37.244 --> 09:39.479
Another village
that's got a shot.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.682
- I think Angel's getting off
on his own Mother Teresa thing.

09:44.517 --> 09:46.787
- Put EZ on the next Adelita
relief run.

09:48.188 --> 09:50.157
- Angel will shut that down.

09:50.257 --> 09:51.625
- Angel doesn't
fucking decide.

09:53.493 --> 09:55.262
The only way these Reyes
brothers work out this beef

09:55.362 --> 09:56.697
is in each other's face.

09:59.466 --> 10:00.834
Make 'em run together.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.002
- Yeah.

10:06.506 --> 10:08.709
- Alvarez.

10:08.809 --> 10:09.843
- I'll call Coco.

10:21.855 --> 10:23.190
- Yeah.

10:23.290 --> 10:24.357
- Let the prospect
do his thing.

10:24.457 --> 10:25.959
- He knows.
- Good.

10:28.195 --> 10:30.530
- Three kings
make a decision yet?

10:30.630 --> 10:32.900
- Yeah, they just finished up.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.501
Coco.

10:34.601 --> 10:35.969
- Tell him we heard
from Alvarez.

10:36.069 --> 10:38.205
Hobart's running with the intel
on the LO.

10:38.305 --> 10:40.073
Have him pick us up,
sewer hatch.

10:40.173 --> 10:42.542
- You want me with?
- No.

10:42.642 --> 10:45.578
Need you to help Ramos
and Contry set up the AZ play.

10:45.679 --> 10:46.914
- I just talked to Bishop.

10:47.014 --> 10:48.515
He wants you
and the prospect

10:48.615 --> 10:49.750
to pick him up in the Bronco.

10:49.850 --> 10:51.584
- Cool.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.736
- You and Creep
stay on the transport.

11:08.836 --> 11:10.037
Let me know
when it's in the air.

11:10.137 --> 11:11.939
- Heading there now.

11:23.650 --> 11:25.185
- Gracias. Sí.

11:28.722 --> 11:30.457
- Gracias.

11:30.557 --> 11:33.526
- Damn, haven't seen this kind
of poor and wretched

11:33.626 --> 11:34.895
since Afghanistan, bro.

11:34.995 --> 11:36.596
- Well, brother,

11:36.696 --> 11:38.531
you've never been
to Fresno.

11:38.631 --> 11:39.967
- Yeah.

11:50.643 --> 11:53.781
- That the Saint?
- Yeah.

11:53.881 --> 11:56.049
- Hey, I know
I'm the real Mexican,

11:56.149 --> 11:57.450
but on this side, it doesn't
mean I do all the work.

11:57.550 --> 11:58.485
Come on.

11:58.585 --> 12:02.422
- Yeah.

12:18.972 --> 12:21.108
- As soon as Potter's mercs
kick down that door,

12:21.208 --> 12:23.610
we follow fast,
destroy any data,

12:23.710 --> 12:25.345
find a place
to plant this shit.

12:25.445 --> 12:27.247
- They gotta think
they just slaughtered

12:27.347 --> 12:29.182
a rebel command post.

12:30.650 --> 12:32.152
- Who will
they be slaughtering?

12:32.252 --> 12:35.622
- Human traffickers, scumbags.

12:43.897 --> 12:45.432
- These the guys
Potter hired?

12:45.532 --> 12:48.201
- Hobart's ex-Green Beret.

12:48.301 --> 12:50.337
Most of these guys
were in his unit.

12:50.437 --> 12:53.941
- Stone fuckin' killers.

12:54.041 --> 12:56.543
- Every T.O.D. is a C.O.D.

13:08.521 --> 13:09.957
- Those your guys?

13:10.057 --> 13:12.893
- Partners,
M.C. from Santo Padre.

13:12.993 --> 13:15.695
A lot of them are ex-military.

13:16.563 --> 13:17.664
Primo.

13:21.201 --> 13:23.503
- Gentlemen.

13:31.845 --> 13:34.181
All right, intel puts
the rebel HQ

13:34.281 --> 13:36.649
at the blue building,
northeast corner, first floor.

13:36.749 --> 13:38.318
Looks like nine, ten targets.

13:38.418 --> 13:39.386
We'll breach the front.

13:39.486 --> 13:41.221
The rest of you guys
cover the exits.

13:42.555 --> 13:44.057
- Riz, go with.

13:44.157 --> 13:46.159
Watch your six, huh?

13:46.259 --> 13:48.061
- Locals?

13:48.161 --> 13:49.696
- La policía knows we're here.

13:49.796 --> 13:51.698
They'll stay clear.

13:51.798 --> 13:53.166
We got a guy working recon

13:53.266 --> 13:55.702
checking the high rocks
for scopes or spotters.

13:56.336 --> 13:58.671
Time to shut down
Los Olvidados.

13:59.873 --> 14:01.274
Gear up.
Let's go.

14:34.074 --> 14:35.608
- Move in!

15:13.446 --> 15:16.016
- We got two runners.

15:25.425 --> 15:26.359
- Oh, shit.

15:31.631 --> 15:33.533
- Ugh!

15:58.658 --> 16:00.160
- Kitchen's clear.

16:04.564 --> 16:06.199
- Bedroom's clear.

16:10.170 --> 16:12.572
- Second bedroom's clear.

16:12.672 --> 16:15.008
- All clear.

16:15.108 --> 16:17.144
- Pull any tech, anything
that might be intel.

16:17.244 --> 16:18.878
Go.
- Copy.

16:21.648 --> 16:22.882
- You recognize
any of 'em?

16:24.717 --> 16:26.253
- Yeah.

16:26.353 --> 16:28.188
Looks like Pablo.

16:28.288 --> 16:29.722
Might be Adelita's second.

16:31.324 --> 16:32.492
- There's more outside.

16:32.592 --> 16:35.062
No one got away.

16:35.162 --> 16:36.929
- Got these off
the guys we dropped.

16:39.599 --> 16:41.201
- Good work, gentlemen.

16:41.301 --> 16:43.336
- Won't get much info
out of these.

16:43.436 --> 16:47.174
- Hobart, these'll help,
hard drives.

16:47.274 --> 16:48.375
Found them in the bread box.

16:49.909 --> 16:53.046
- Found some LO propaganda,
bedroom dresser.

17:00.019 --> 17:01.788
- We'll let Potter know.

17:01.888 --> 17:03.790
This might be the deathblow
to your rebel problem.

17:03.890 --> 17:05.692
- This is recon.
Spot a little bird.

17:05.792 --> 17:07.060
- Go.

17:12.899 --> 17:14.567
- It's Mini.

17:14.667 --> 17:15.868
It all went down.

17:20.140 --> 17:21.308
Hola?

17:21.408 --> 17:23.076
Mini?

17:25.578 --> 17:26.946
Hola?

17:27.046 --> 17:28.915
Mini?

17:44.331 --> 17:46.933
- * Mother of exiles

17:47.033 --> 17:49.136
* The torch of hope

17:49.236 --> 17:52.004
* In the toss of the tempest

17:52.105 --> 17:54.507
* Threw us Madison's rope

17:54.607 --> 17:58.111
* But the brazen giant

17:58.211 --> 18:00.113
* With limbs astride

18:00.213 --> 18:03.116
* Blocks the golden door

18:03.216 --> 18:07.187
* To the U.S. of Lies

18:07.287 --> 18:10.757
* Damn your huddled masses

18:10.857 --> 18:14.127
* Scrub our floors

18:14.227 --> 18:16.696
* Cut our grasses

18:16.796 --> 18:19.299
* I am a wolf

18:19.399 --> 18:22.202
* A wild cur

18:22.302 --> 18:25.305
* Cut from the pack

18:25.405 --> 18:28.007
* With blood on my fur

18:28.107 --> 18:30.643
* Every howl

18:30.743 --> 18:33.480
* Marks a debt

18:33.580 --> 18:36.983
* 'Cause a beaten dog

18:38.785 --> 18:41.988
* Never forgets

18:42.088 --> 18:44.657
* Every howl

18:44.757 --> 18:47.460
* Marks the debt

18:47.560 --> 18:52.199
* 'Cause a beaten dog

18:52.299 --> 18:55.902
* Never forgets

18:57.904 --> 19:01.007
* Never forgets

19:12.685 --> 19:14.086
- Coming in!
- Come in.

19:15.355 --> 19:17.390
- Found Delgado.

19:17.490 --> 19:19.692
- Who's this?
- Our little bird.

19:22.262 --> 19:24.864
- She was watching from
the rocks on a sat phone.

19:24.964 --> 19:25.998
Gotta be a scout.

19:26.098 --> 19:27.600
- She's just a kid.

19:27.700 --> 19:30.102
- Kid with a KG-9
in her bag.

19:30.203 --> 19:32.372
- Tie her up.
See what she knows.

19:35.942 --> 19:38.678
- Soldier.
Remember, she's not a kid.

19:38.778 --> 19:40.079
She's a killer.

19:57.797 --> 20:02.369
- Not many butcher shops with
a classic literature section

20:02.469 --> 20:05.405
in case I want
a little Márquez with my--

20:05.505 --> 20:07.907
my ribeye.

20:09.442 --> 20:11.077
- I know who you are.

20:12.312 --> 20:16.082
- Obviously, a meat-eater.

20:16.182 --> 20:18.785
Of course you know
who I am.

20:18.885 --> 20:20.287
I wouldn't expect
anything less

20:20.387 --> 20:23.323
from a man
with your experience.

20:23.423 --> 20:25.325
- This about my son?

20:25.425 --> 20:29.962
- Actually, it's about you,
Ignacio...

20:32.231 --> 20:35.768
And your days as an inspector
in La División Entre Torres.

20:39.906 --> 20:42.275
I have so many questions.

20:44.277 --> 20:45.978
I--I--

20:46.078 --> 20:50.417
I truly hope that Ezekiel gets
his eidetic memory from you.

20:53.920 --> 20:54.987
- Heard from our team.

20:55.087 --> 20:57.123
- Hmm.

21:03.195 --> 21:05.332
- I look forward
to our reminiscing.

21:18.545 --> 21:20.613
- What the hell
was the kid doing here?

21:20.713 --> 21:22.982
- LO rebels have been keeping
tabs on the human traffickers

21:23.082 --> 21:24.384
waiting for
the right time.

21:24.484 --> 21:26.118
- Kids are always
the best scouts.

21:26.218 --> 21:27.820
A place like this,
they're fucking invisible.

21:27.920 --> 21:29.055
- They're gonna fuck her up.

21:29.155 --> 21:31.057
- Let's move.

21:31.157 --> 21:32.625
- She could tell 'em
everything.

21:33.993 --> 21:35.161
- We gotta do something.

21:35.261 --> 21:37.029
- It's not that simple, Primo.

21:37.129 --> 21:39.298
These mercs report directly
to the DOJ.

21:40.367 --> 21:42.034
- It is simple.

21:42.134 --> 21:43.570
They're gonna torture
a little girl.

21:51.511 --> 21:53.580
- Sorry, brother,
my guy lost his cell phone.

21:53.680 --> 21:55.247
Mind if we take a look?

21:55.348 --> 21:56.916
- I didn't see anything,
but go ahead.

22:07.259 --> 22:09.161
- You have any kids?

22:14.434 --> 22:16.603
- No phone in here, man.

22:25.945 --> 22:29.015
- Damn, how'd you miss
this shit?

22:29.115 --> 22:31.217
- Y'all need to get
the fuck outta here.

22:35.788 --> 22:37.089
-  What?

22:54.373 --> 22:55.542
- The fuck?

23:00.312 --> 23:01.581
Fucker.

24:03.142 --> 24:05.444
- * All the way down
I was hoping *

24:05.545 --> 24:06.713
- Yay!

24:10.049 --> 24:12.719
- * All the way down
I could see *

24:15.922 --> 24:18.691
- How's our boy?
- He's happy today.

24:23.162 --> 24:25.665
Thank you.

24:25.765 --> 24:28.334
Will Miguel be home
for dinner tonight?

24:28.434 --> 24:29.736
- I don't think so.

24:32.539 --> 24:35.174
- He's been away
so much lately.

24:36.909 --> 24:38.545
The boy should have
his father.

24:38.645 --> 24:41.848
- Cristobal's fine, Dita.

24:42.682 --> 24:45.417
- How you doing, my love?

24:45.518 --> 24:47.419
- What are you playing with?

24:53.159 --> 24:56.062
- No other territories
are showing rebel activity?

24:56.162 --> 24:58.931
Nothing near the riots,
the farm belt strikes?

24:59.031 --> 25:01.200
- No, our satellites
and drones

25:01.300 --> 25:03.402
forced most of the cells
out of the open desert.

25:03.502 --> 25:05.672
And after today,

25:05.772 --> 25:08.675
we've wiped out
three encampments,

25:08.775 --> 25:12.178
a dozen weapon caches,
six communication hubs,

25:12.278 --> 25:14.914
pretty much shut down
the entire propaganda machine.

25:15.014 --> 25:17.349
- And what of our mother-to-be?

25:17.449 --> 25:19.185
- Other than that security
camera footage

25:19.285 --> 25:22.521
a few months ago,
Adelita is still off the grid.

25:22.622 --> 25:26.125
Guess getting knocked up
has shifted her priorities.

25:26.225 --> 25:28.360
- Perhaps.

25:28.460 --> 25:32.565
Keep Hobart on the dime
for another month or so.

25:32.665 --> 25:38.104
Let's be certain Los Olvidados
are indeed olvidados.

25:43.442 --> 25:46.145
- What's wrong?

25:46.245 --> 25:47.980
- Are those
real fingernails?

25:49.481 --> 25:52.284
- Yeah,
it's a French tip.

25:52.384 --> 25:54.053
It keeps me
from biting them.

25:54.153 --> 25:57.790
- Oh, functional beauty.

25:57.890 --> 26:04.063
Alas, my alpha-keratin
is a bit diminished as well.

26:04.163 --> 26:05.832
Bad habit,
nail-biting.

26:05.932 --> 26:07.967
- Yep.

26:08.067 --> 26:10.236
- At least
my nocturnal enuresis

26:10.336 --> 26:12.238
is no longer a problem.

26:14.173 --> 26:16.175
I was a bed wetter.

26:17.844 --> 26:19.846
- Glad that cleared up.

26:19.946 --> 26:21.247
- Small victories.

26:23.015 --> 26:24.784
- Killing these mercs.

26:24.884 --> 26:26.919
- How fucked are we?

26:27.019 --> 26:29.255
- Very fucked.

26:31.457 --> 26:34.493
- Fuck.

26:34.593 --> 26:36.528
- You okay, mi'jo?

26:36.629 --> 26:38.297
- Yeah.

26:38.397 --> 26:40.366
- I owe you one, Ezekiel.

26:40.466 --> 26:43.002
- Just do what I had to do,
el padrino.

26:43.102 --> 26:44.203
- I thought maybe you did it

26:44.303 --> 26:46.773
'cause you didn't want
to see me dead.

26:48.474 --> 26:49.608
- That too.

26:49.709 --> 26:51.110
- Good.

26:51.210 --> 26:52.812
That makes me happy.

27:01.821 --> 27:03.155
- Four dozen.

27:03.255 --> 27:04.657
- 4 times 12 is 48.

27:04.757 --> 27:06.125
- Yeah, thanks, Rain Man.

27:07.259 --> 27:08.695
- You're most welcome.

27:08.795 --> 27:11.630
- We miss you, Chucky.

27:13.365 --> 27:14.667
- Can I ask a question, Hap?

27:14.767 --> 27:16.335
- You got to talk to Chibs.

27:16.435 --> 27:19.571
- Not about the bet.

27:19.672 --> 27:22.041
I thought Jax wanted you guys
out of the gun business.

27:22.141 --> 27:25.912
- Transition's taking longer
than we thought.

27:26.012 --> 27:27.479
It's a lot at stake.

27:41.293 --> 27:42.829
- EZ around?
- No.

27:42.929 --> 27:45.097
- Angel?
- No one's here.

27:45.197 --> 27:47.333
I'm not sure
when they're back, sorry.

27:47.433 --> 27:51.037
- All right, tell EZ
I need to talk to him

27:51.137 --> 27:52.571
and stay off
his cell phone.

27:52.671 --> 27:55.174
- Yeah, okay.

28:02.614 --> 28:03.582
- Who's the old man?

28:03.682 --> 28:05.284
- Felipe?

28:05.384 --> 28:07.386
Oh, EZ and Angel's pop.

28:07.486 --> 28:10.857
- His sons are Mayans?
- Yeah.

28:10.957 --> 28:12.892
Why?

28:12.992 --> 28:14.393
- Got a long drive
ahead of us.

28:14.493 --> 28:16.128
Let's go.

28:18.130 --> 28:19.198
- Something wrong, Hap?

28:19.298 --> 28:20.532
- Shut up.
- All right.

28:46.759 --> 28:48.795
- How did it all go?

28:52.564 --> 28:54.100
Okay.

29:01.941 --> 29:03.309
- Table.

29:23.429 --> 29:24.931
- Hey.

29:32.404 --> 29:34.440
- The numbers
don't add up differently

29:34.540 --> 29:36.608
the more you look at them.

29:36.708 --> 29:39.711
- Just pulling some of
the infrastructure costs.

29:39.812 --> 29:41.180
Martin is bringing over

29:41.280 --> 29:44.183
his public utility guy
this afternoon.

29:46.018 --> 29:48.154
It's just so many variables
with the wildfires.

29:48.254 --> 29:51.490
- You know...

29:51.590 --> 29:54.126
You're allowed
to enjoy this.

29:55.061 --> 29:57.129
- I'll enjoy it tomorrow after
it's submitted and approved.

29:57.229 --> 29:59.331
- Mm.

29:59.431 --> 30:01.633
This was all you.

30:01.733 --> 30:03.836
- That's ridiculous.

30:07.373 --> 30:11.343
You know, I married you
for your brains, right?

30:11.443 --> 30:13.245
It's so sexy.

30:13.345 --> 30:17.183
- Just make sure sexy
is home by 4:00.

30:20.186 --> 30:23.322
You have to take her
to Dr. Cayman.

30:23.422 --> 30:24.924
I've got Martin.
You promised.

30:25.024 --> 30:26.492
- I know.

30:26.592 --> 30:27.994
I will.

30:29.395 --> 30:31.563
- She's getting worse.

30:33.332 --> 30:34.934
- We don't know that.

30:35.034 --> 30:37.169
- You're not with her
as much as I am.

30:37.269 --> 30:40.606
I love her, Miguel,

30:40.706 --> 30:42.774
but she makes me
so fucking anxious.

30:42.875 --> 30:44.911
- We'll figure it out,
querida.

30:45.011 --> 30:46.212
- Mm-hmm.

30:50.449 --> 30:52.784
- Mr. Alvarez is here.

31:08.800 --> 31:10.970
- My cousin's a trooper
in Alameda.

31:11.070 --> 31:13.372
Pulled anything
the state had on him.

31:13.472 --> 31:15.807
- Thank you, Franky.

31:15.908 --> 31:17.543
- You wanna give me
a clue yet?

31:17.643 --> 31:18.945
- Just curiosity.

31:19.045 --> 31:21.547
- A Google search is curious.

31:21.647 --> 31:22.949
Having me run
background checks,

31:23.049 --> 31:25.651
pull local
and state records?

31:25.751 --> 31:27.886
That's something else.

31:27.987 --> 31:29.088
- I know it's a lot,

31:29.188 --> 31:30.222
but I wouldn't ask
if this wasn't--

31:30.322 --> 31:33.059
- I know, a family thing.

31:35.261 --> 31:37.463
Don't make me part of something
I'm gonna regret, EZ.

31:40.632 --> 31:42.434
- I promise.

31:42.534 --> 31:46.338
If it lands on you,
nothing happens here.

31:49.675 --> 31:51.510
- Stay safe, dirtbag.

31:51.610 --> 31:52.511
- You too, pig.

32:49.801 --> 32:51.703
- Sorry.

32:51.803 --> 32:53.839
- Bad time?
- No.

32:56.008 --> 32:58.344
What's going on?

32:58.444 --> 33:02.081
- Potter came by
the shop last night.

33:02.181 --> 33:04.083
- Why?

33:04.183 --> 33:05.884
- Didn't say,

33:05.984 --> 33:09.688
just made a comment
on needing information.

33:09.788 --> 33:12.924
Shit from my past.

33:13.025 --> 33:15.427
Probably just fucking with me.

33:18.230 --> 33:20.566
- Nothing Potter does
is random.

33:24.336 --> 33:26.538
It means something.

33:26.638 --> 33:29.241
- As long as he
doesn't hurt you.

33:33.079 --> 33:37.015
You've never asked anything
about what was in the lockbox.

33:39.285 --> 33:42.621
Ignacio Cortina.

33:42.721 --> 33:44.423
I know you saw it.

33:45.791 --> 33:47.793
- It was on you
to bring up.

33:47.893 --> 33:49.395
- Yeah, I will,

33:49.495 --> 33:52.264
when it makes sense
to hear it.

33:54.266 --> 33:55.701
Angel?

33:55.801 --> 33:57.136
- He doesn't know anything.

33:57.236 --> 34:00.072
- Mm.

34:00.172 --> 34:01.107
- They reached out at all?

34:01.207 --> 34:03.809
- Not a word.

34:03.909 --> 34:06.912
Almost eight months.

34:07.012 --> 34:08.547
Things any better
around here?

34:10.149 --> 34:13.152
- He deals with me
what he has to.

34:13.252 --> 34:15.053
Club stuff.

34:16.455 --> 34:17.789
- Club stuff
give you that?

34:19.325 --> 34:21.893
Yeah.

34:21.993 --> 34:24.296
- You wanna talk about it?

34:24.396 --> 34:26.098
- When it makes sense
to hear.

34:29.000 --> 34:32.338
- You think this merc fuck-up
can blow back on us?

34:32.438 --> 34:34.740
- Padre still thinks he has
Galindo by the balls.

34:34.840 --> 34:38.076
Doesn't know about
our deal with the LO.

34:38.177 --> 34:39.978
Makes no sense for the cartel
to off the mercs.

34:40.078 --> 34:41.480
- So best-case scenario,

34:41.580 --> 34:43.582
this all comes crashing down
on Adelita?

34:43.682 --> 34:44.916
- It's a possibility.

34:45.016 --> 34:46.518
- How the fuck
they find the kid?

34:46.618 --> 34:48.754
Why wasn't someone
watching the recon?

34:50.356 --> 34:51.457
What the fuck
was the prospect...

34:51.557 --> 34:53.459
- EZ was where
I told him to be.

34:53.559 --> 34:55.827
- He saved el padrino
from taking a bullet, carnan.

34:55.927 --> 34:57.163
- Course he did.

35:04.603 --> 35:06.505
- We're all set
with the AZ chapters:

35:06.605 --> 35:09.275
Tempe, Tucson, Sahuarita.

35:09.375 --> 35:11.343
They'll be down this afternoon.

35:11.443 --> 35:12.944
- Pulling the prison drops?
- Yeah.

35:13.044 --> 35:14.480
- Yuma's handling it.

35:14.580 --> 35:16.548
- And the problem,

35:16.648 --> 35:18.049
if it ends up being
an internal one?

35:19.218 --> 35:21.387
- It falls on the charter.

35:21.487 --> 35:23.189
They decide how it goes away.

35:41.540 --> 35:44.876
- Biggs,

35:44.976 --> 35:47.346
Jonas,

35:47.446 --> 35:49.748
and Delgado.

35:49.848 --> 35:51.683
Dead.

35:51.783 --> 35:53.552
Three of my best men.

35:53.652 --> 35:55.221
- And the kid was gone?

35:55.321 --> 35:57.256
- Yeah.

35:57.356 --> 35:59.891
- That's a very dangerous
12-year-old kid.

35:59.991 --> 36:01.527
- You think
this shit is funny?

36:01.627 --> 36:05.163
- No, I think the child
is the reason they're dead.

36:05.264 --> 36:07.032
Mm.

36:07.132 --> 36:08.567
- The rebels?

36:08.667 --> 36:10.702
- Well,

36:10.802 --> 36:12.571
I can't imagine
it was locals.

36:12.671 --> 36:15.106
- These were seasoned warriors,
Mr. Potter.

36:15.207 --> 36:17.543
Whoever did this was trained
and had a plan.

36:17.643 --> 36:19.445
- You think the kid
was a trap?

36:19.545 --> 36:20.712
- Split up our unit.

36:20.812 --> 36:22.180
It's what I would have done.

36:22.281 --> 36:24.350
- Why now?

36:24.450 --> 36:26.252
Rebels have been
pushed back for months.

36:26.352 --> 36:27.586
Hard drives you brought
confirm it.

36:27.686 --> 36:29.255
No movement in other cells.

36:29.355 --> 36:30.522
No active recruitment.

36:30.622 --> 36:31.623
They're dead.

36:34.860 --> 36:37.296
- And perhaps waiting
to be reborn.

36:39.365 --> 36:41.900
How far along
would you say she is here?

36:43.902 --> 36:46.104
- I don't know,
five months, maybe more.

36:46.204 --> 36:48.440
- Perhaps her water has broken

36:48.540 --> 36:52.311
and el bebé is now safely
swaddled in a Mexican manger.

36:52.411 --> 36:54.980
- And Mama's making up
for lost time?

36:55.080 --> 36:58.384
- Or a nasty case
of postpartum.

36:58.484 --> 37:01.753
- I want that bitch,

37:01.853 --> 37:04.490
and I don't give a shit
if it's on your dime or mine.

37:06.758 --> 37:09.160
- Let's facilitate
the major's hate, agent.

37:11.963 --> 37:14.266
It is the American way.

37:44.296 --> 37:45.464
- No.

38:41.353 --> 38:43.054
- What's up?

38:43.154 --> 38:44.656
- Brother.

38:44.756 --> 38:46.858
- Good to see you, brother.

38:48.660 --> 38:50.996
- Hey, ese, you're the one
with the memory shit, right?

38:51.096 --> 38:52.698
- I guess so.

39:05.877 --> 39:07.713
Just talked to Pop.

39:07.813 --> 39:08.880
Potter was in the shop
last night.

39:08.980 --> 39:11.216
- Maybe he wanted
a good steak.

39:12.751 --> 39:15.921
- Show up like that,
can't be anything good.

39:16.021 --> 39:17.523
- Then it's
the old man's problem.

39:17.623 --> 39:19.725
- That we fucking created.
- No.

39:19.825 --> 39:21.560
That you fucking created.

39:21.660 --> 39:23.629
- Hey, come on, Angel.

39:25.063 --> 39:26.364
- No.

39:37.075 --> 39:39.611
- Need anything else?

39:42.614 --> 39:44.282
- Think we're good, Chucky.

39:47.218 --> 39:49.320
- We know anything else
about this beef?

39:49.421 --> 39:51.557
Starting to feel like
their fucking mother.

39:51.657 --> 39:54.793
- Man, Angel says
it's old shit, family wounds.

39:54.893 --> 39:58.129
- Family or not, been going on
way too fucking long.

39:58.229 --> 39:59.565
It's bleeding
all over the table.

40:05.471 --> 40:06.838
- We're back.

40:16.582 --> 40:18.416
- Under the building
inspection,

40:18.517 --> 40:19.985
but, actually, I've added it
as an extra fee already.

40:20.085 --> 40:21.520
- Okay.

40:21.620 --> 40:22.921
- Excuse me.

40:23.021 --> 40:25.356
We should leave soon.

40:25.457 --> 40:27.358
- No, I'm not
taking you today, Dita.

40:27.459 --> 40:29.661
- Why not?

40:29.761 --> 40:32.297
- Sorry.
I'll be right back.

40:35.767 --> 40:38.537
Miguel, he's taking you
to Dr. Cayman,

40:38.637 --> 40:40.138
and he should be here
any minute,

40:40.238 --> 40:41.272
so why don't you
just sit down?

40:41.372 --> 40:43.008
- Why is Miguel taking me?

40:43.108 --> 40:45.343
I'm sure he has more
important things to do.

40:46.712 --> 40:47.979
- So do I.

40:48.079 --> 40:50.649
- Oh, yes, of course.

40:50.749 --> 40:52.951
You go back to your meeting.

40:54.720 --> 40:57.188
And I'll be in the car
with Nestor.

40:57.288 --> 40:59.858
Hope we don't miss
the appointment.

40:59.958 --> 41:02.193
I think I might
be getting worse.

41:27.553 --> 41:29.855
- Your call is being
forwarded...

42:10.261 --> 42:12.263
- Want to tell us why
the shot callers are here?

42:12.363 --> 42:13.965
- Yeah, we thought
this was about

42:14.065 --> 42:16.134
picking up guns
and making a progress report.

42:16.234 --> 42:18.136
- It'll all make sense.

42:18.236 --> 42:19.571
- Weapons, gentlemen.

42:40.325 --> 42:43.829
- We've hit an ugly bump
in our Arizona prison pipeline.

42:45.731 --> 42:47.666
That's why you're all here.

42:47.766 --> 42:50.135
- And it's the reason
we're here.

42:51.837 --> 42:55.674
- Tempe, Sahuarita, and Tucson,
the heroin that you sent

42:55.774 --> 42:58.977
to your respective prison drops
this morning,

42:59.077 --> 43:00.646
my charter pulled
before they got there.

43:00.746 --> 43:02.480
- The fuck for?

43:02.580 --> 43:04.515
- One of your last shipments
was cut so deep,

43:04.616 --> 43:06.317
three inmates OD'd.

43:06.417 --> 43:08.987
I don't have to tell you
what that does to our business.

43:09.087 --> 43:10.689
It can't happen again.

43:10.789 --> 43:12.290
- You putting this shit
on one of us?

43:12.390 --> 43:13.825
- No, carnan, we just need

43:13.925 --> 43:15.961
to take that possibility
off the table.

43:19.497 --> 43:20.431
- Get the prospect.

43:20.531 --> 43:21.800
- Yeah.

44:08.213 --> 44:10.515
- Charter ID's
in a different place.

44:16.554 --> 44:17.889
- Huh.

44:22.027 --> 44:24.662
Tucson.
- This is bullshit.

44:28.734 --> 44:32.537
- If this stays clear,
it's pure.

44:32.637 --> 44:35.841
It turns blue,
it's been cut.

44:43.614 --> 44:44.582
Shit.

44:44.682 --> 44:47.585
- What the fuck?

44:47.685 --> 44:49.520
- You do the pickup
from the airdrop?

44:49.620 --> 44:51.022
- You think it was me?

44:51.122 --> 44:53.124
- You're the only one
who was alone with the package.

44:53.224 --> 44:54.425
- This is crazy.

44:54.525 --> 44:55.861
- Is it?

44:56.795 --> 44:58.396
- Answer him.

45:01.432 --> 45:02.968
- There's stupid,

45:03.068 --> 45:05.270
and there's really
fuckin' stupid.

45:15.814 --> 45:17.816
- Sorry, brothers.

45:17.916 --> 45:19.717
We had no idea.

45:26.657 --> 45:29.094
- We know that.

45:29.194 --> 45:31.229
- You'll handle the problem.

45:31.329 --> 45:33.164
- Yeah.

45:33.264 --> 45:35.233
- Do it before you leave.

46:00.258 --> 46:02.193
- I'm gonna head out,
if it's cool.

46:03.528 --> 46:05.496
- Sit down.

46:11.402 --> 46:14.672
- This shit with you and Angel,

46:14.772 --> 46:16.541
haven't pressed it.

46:16.641 --> 46:18.376
Knew it was blood.

46:18.476 --> 46:19.777
Figured it would
correct itself.

46:19.878 --> 46:21.646
- It hasn't.

46:24.182 --> 46:27.485
- Your patch vote
is coming up.

46:27.585 --> 46:30.856
Judging by the vibe I get,

46:30.956 --> 46:32.690
we don't have
a unanimous table.

46:34.725 --> 46:35.961
- Angel said he'd vote no.

46:36.061 --> 46:37.128
- He don't say shit.

46:37.228 --> 46:39.064
Neither do you.

46:39.164 --> 46:41.499
That's the problem.

46:41.599 --> 46:43.334
- It's gone on too long.

46:43.434 --> 46:46.571
I don't care how you do it.
Work it the fuck out now.

46:50.842 --> 46:54.245
- Yeah.

46:54.345 --> 46:55.847
Okay.

47:00.118 --> 47:03.154
* Señor

47:03.254 --> 47:07.492
* Señor

47:07.592 --> 47:10.528
* Can you tell me
where we're headin'*

47:10.628 --> 47:14.866
* Lincoln County Road
or Armageddon *

47:14.966 --> 47:19.504
* Seems like I been down
this way before *

47:22.207 --> 47:26.277
* Is there any truth in that,
señor *

47:28.013 --> 47:30.215
* Señor

47:31.682 --> 47:35.053
* Señor

47:35.153 --> 47:37.688
* Do you know
where she's hidin' *

47:39.624 --> 47:42.427
* How long
we gonna be riding *

47:42.527 --> 47:46.731
* How long must I keep
my eyes glued to the door *

47:49.400 --> 47:51.970
* Will there be
any comfort there, señor *

47:56.707 --> 48:01.980
* There's a wicked wind still
blowing on that upper deck *

48:04.382 --> 48:06.817
* There's an iron cross
still hanging down *

48:06.918 --> 48:09.787
* From around her neck

48:10.821 --> 48:13.458
* There's a marching band
still playing *

48:13.558 --> 48:15.660
* In that vacant lot

48:18.196 --> 48:21.732
* Where's she held me in
her arms one time and said *

48:21.832 --> 48:24.669
* "Forget me not"

48:55.366 --> 48:59.937
- Listen, I am so sorry
about today.

49:00.038 --> 49:02.640
- Where were you?

49:02.740 --> 49:05.110
- There were
some complications,

49:05.210 --> 49:06.344
the rebels.

49:06.444 --> 49:07.612
I was on the other side.

49:07.712 --> 49:09.280
- You were with Adelita.

49:10.881 --> 49:13.118
- Yes.
- This whole time?

49:13.218 --> 49:15.153
- Alvarez and me.

49:23.861 --> 49:26.197
- You should get some sleep.

49:26.297 --> 49:28.666
You look exhausted.

49:30.135 --> 49:32.637
- Yeah, I am.

49:32.737 --> 49:33.971
- Okay.

49:41.346 --> 49:43.514
- Has she told you
who the father is yet?

49:47.818 --> 49:49.054
Adelita.

49:51.189 --> 49:54.225
- No.

49:54.325 --> 49:56.761
I don't think
she's told anyone.

50:01.532 --> 50:03.601
* Señor

50:05.203 --> 50:06.937
* Señor

50:09.374 --> 50:12.177
* I can see
that painted wagon *

50:12.277 --> 50:16.681
* Smell the tail
of the dragon *

50:16.781 --> 50:20.518
* I can't stand the suspense
here anymore *

50:23.121 --> 50:27.958
* Can you tell me
who to contact here, señor *

50:30.161 --> 50:32.630
* Well, the last thing
I remember *

50:32.730 --> 50:35.466
* Before I stripped
and kneeled *

50:37.168 --> 50:39.404
* Was that trainload
of fools *

50:39.504 --> 50:40.771
* Bogged down
in a magnetic field *

50:40.871 --> 50:43.040
- Mom!
- All right, come on.

50:45.143 --> 50:47.712
- Mom! Angel!

50:47.812 --> 50:49.114
- Boys.

50:51.449 --> 50:54.152
No dessert if you're fighting,
okay?

50:54.252 --> 50:56.721
* It's the real thing

50:58.223 --> 50:59.990
* Señor

51:01.559 --> 51:03.894
* Señor

51:03.994 --> 51:08.233
* You know their hearts
is as hard as leather *

51:08.333 --> 51:12.237
* Give me a minute,
let me get it together *

51:12.337 --> 51:17.242
* Just gotta pick myself
up off the floor *

51:20.178 --> 51:23.348
* I'm ready when you are,
señor *

51:26.117 --> 51:28.253
* Señor

51:36.827 --> 51:38.796
* Señor

52:36.854 --> 52:38.856
- What are you doing here?
- We have to talk, Angel.

52:38.956 --> 52:40.925
- There's nothing
to talk about.

52:43.261 --> 52:44.429
- Yeah, there is.

52:44.529 --> 52:47.332
- What, your, um,
sponsor sent you here?

52:47.432 --> 52:49.066
Worried his golden boy
didn't get the votes he needs?

52:49.166 --> 52:50.435
- I don't give a fuck
about the vote.

52:50.535 --> 52:52.370
- Well, if this is about Pop,
man, then stay out of it.

52:52.470 --> 52:53.704
It's none of your
fucking business.

52:53.804 --> 52:55.373
- It's not about Pop.

52:55.473 --> 52:57.675
It's about Mom.
- What?

53:05.182 --> 53:07.017
I know who killed her.

54:08.346 --> 54:10.581
I need to be part of the club.

54:10.615 --> 54:12.450
The line?

54:12.483 --> 54:14.619
You cross it,
ain't no walkin' it back.

54:14.652 --> 54:17.355
ANNOUNCER: Mayans.
All new Tuesdays at 10:00 on FX.

54:20.257 --> 54:21.992
This is business.
Let's make some money.

54:23.528 --> 54:27.932
I will bring you all down,
one... by... one.

54:27.965 --> 54:29.667
FRANKLIN: Playin'
a different game now.

54:34.672 --> 54:36.874
You can't make people
like you,

54:36.974 --> 54:39.310
but if people
don't respect you,

54:39.344 --> 54:40.811
you can make 'em fear you.

54:50.655 --> 54:52.390
(chattering)

54:52.490 --> 54:54.725
(breathing heavily)

55:00.398 --> 55:03.300
(screaming)

55:06.871 --> 55:08.506
-(recorder playing theme song)
-(babbling)

55:08.539 --> 55:09.540
Pink eye!

55:11.308 --> 55:14.011
(grunting)

55:14.044 --> 55:16.046
(babbling)

55:16.814 --> 55:18.182
Pink eye!

55:18.215 --> 55:20.385
FRANK: Don't judge me!
This is art!

55:20.418 --> 55:21.419
(recorder hits sour note)
