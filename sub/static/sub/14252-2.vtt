00:19.160 --> 00:22.072
Seven of Nine.
How's my favourite Borg?

00:22.240 --> 00:26.677
Annoyed. In future, announce
your presence before entering.

00:26.840 --> 00:29.832
- Sorry, I should knock.
- Are we ready?

00:30.000 --> 00:32.992
Yes. Spatial conditions are ripe.

00:33.160 --> 00:35.958
A protonebula could emerge shortly.

00:36.120 --> 00:38.839
Mr Paris is expecting us.

00:39.760 --> 00:42.115
Not a bad looking hologram.

00:47.840 --> 00:49.796
This should be exciting.

00:49.960 --> 00:54.238
It's just an astronomical survey.
What is your function?

00:54.400 --> 00:59.758
To study the nebula's effect on the crew.
This may be a new radiation.

00:59.920 --> 01:03.151
I can't wait to see
one of these clouds.

01:03.320 --> 01:06.073
I brought a holo-imager for snapshots.

01:06.240 --> 01:09.357
There will be no time for recreation.

01:09.520 --> 01:12.751
The Borg, party poopers of the galaxy.

01:12.920 --> 01:17.357
Tomorrow we'll start you on
developing your joie de vivre.

01:27.680 --> 01:32.515
Sorry. Just a little spatial turbulence.
Nothing to worry about.

01:34.840 --> 01:36.193
Hello there.

01:36.360 --> 01:40.911
I don't know about you,
but I've got class-2 claustrophobia.

01:41.080 --> 01:44.038
- I remember it well.
- Lieutenant?

01:44.200 --> 01:47.556
That's what cadets
used to call these shuttles.

01:47.720 --> 01:51.269
Fast, manoeuvrable,
but not built for comfort.

01:51.440 --> 01:55.069
They would shoehorn cadets in
for weeks at a time.

01:55.240 --> 01:58.118
You did not want to open that airlock.

01:58.280 --> 02:02.353
You should design a new shuttle.
Larger, more efficient.

02:02.520 --> 02:04.476
Not a bad idea.

02:07.600 --> 02:09.989
I'm reading plasma surges.

02:14.720 --> 02:17.553
All stop. Keep our distance.

02:20.160 --> 02:23.357
Move over. I want to get a group shot.

02:23.520 --> 02:26.830
- I'm busy.
- Then smile, like I know you can.

02:31.120 --> 02:33.395
- What was that?
- A plasma surge.

02:33.560 --> 02:36.632
It's massive. Tom, back us off.

02:42.560 --> 02:46.314
- We're in the gravimetric shear.
- Engines are down.

02:47.840 --> 02:52.630
- The away team is in distress.
- They're engulfed in the shearline.

02:52.800 --> 02:56.190
Full impulse.
Stand by for emergency beam out.

02:57.600 --> 03:02.037
- Unless the shuttle clears that nebula...
- It won't. They lost propulsion.

03:02.200 --> 03:05.112
- It will be a rough transport.
- Energise.

03:10.920 --> 03:15.789
- I'm having trouble separating patterns.
- Reset the pattern buffers.

03:15.960 --> 03:17.996
The signals are clearing.

03:21.080 --> 03:23.036
Is everyone all right?

03:29.680 --> 03:35.357
- My emitter. It's been damaged.
- I'll transfer your program to sickbay.

03:46.320 --> 03:49.312
Sickbay to transporter room 1, report.

03:49.480 --> 03:53.632
- Some emitter circuits were fused.
- Can you repair it?

03:53.800 --> 03:57.554
- Most likely. I'll run a diagnostic.
- Most likely?

03:57.720 --> 04:01.156
Relax, Doctor. I'll keep you posted.
Mulchaey.

04:09.160 --> 04:12.994
Computer,
run diagnostic routine alpha 36.

04:13.160 --> 04:15.116
Diagnostic in progress.

04:15.280 --> 04:19.716
- In the morning, check the results.
- I'll be here early.

06:15.640 --> 06:20.714
Captain's log supplemental.
This protonebula has a mind of its own.

06:20.880 --> 06:23.678
It's still expanding with no end in sight.

06:23.840 --> 06:27.594
We're holding at a safe distance
to monitor its growth.

06:27.760 --> 06:30.274
Rise and shine, Lieutenant.

06:34.840 --> 06:37.400
06:00 hours. Early bird gets the gagh.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.552
What do you want?

06:41.720 --> 06:44.518
I'll settle for my mobile emitter.

06:44.680 --> 06:47.274
What's the ETA on those repairs?

06:47.440 --> 06:49.396
Go away.

06:49.560 --> 06:52.757
Can't you at least give me a prognosis?

06:57.840 --> 07:00.149
The one day I get to sleep in...

07:00.320 --> 07:02.754
You're worried about a few seconds?

07:02.920 --> 07:04.911
My freedom is at stake.

07:06.720 --> 07:09.632
Computer, activate sonic shower.

07:16.960 --> 07:19.554
One more thing. I was thinking...

07:21.120 --> 07:23.076
I'm a doctor, not a peeping Tom.

07:23.240 --> 07:25.196
Nothing I haven't seen before.

07:25.360 --> 07:29.751
Bring the emitter to sickbay
and we can work on it together...

07:29.920 --> 07:31.319
Hello? B'Elanna?

07:42.320 --> 07:45.437
Regeneration cycle incomplete.

07:51.440 --> 07:53.192
Commander.

07:53.360 --> 07:57.478
- How did you sleep?
- Well enough. What's new?

07:57.640 --> 08:01.599
That nebula's expanding
at 8,000 cubic kilometres per hour.

08:01.760 --> 08:04.069
I've adjusted course 11 times.

08:04.240 --> 08:07.232
- You're enjoying the big chair.
- It's not bad.

08:07.400 --> 08:10.756
You've done a fine job.
The crew is impressed.

08:10.920 --> 08:13.673
Is it true they call you "Captain Kim"?

08:13.840 --> 08:16.274
- Good morning.
- Yet to be seen.

08:16.440 --> 08:18.271
Problem?

08:18.440 --> 08:21.830
My proximity transceiver
has been activated.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.639
- That could indicate a Borg presence.
- Harry?

08:24.800 --> 08:29.112
I've been running sensor sweeps.
I haven't seen anything.

08:29.280 --> 08:32.635
- The nebula could mask a vessel.
- Not a chance.

08:32.799 --> 08:35.678
Not even a Borg cube
would last seconds.

08:35.840 --> 08:39.469
Your transceiver
could be malfunctioning.

08:39.640 --> 08:42.359
- It is possible.
- Pay a visit to sickbay.

08:42.520 --> 08:46.877
In the meantime we'll redouble
our scans, just to be sure.

08:47.040 --> 08:48.996
Very well.

08:50.880 --> 08:53.110
I'll get the scans underway.

08:53.280 --> 08:56.272
If you don't mind being an ensign again.

09:33.720 --> 09:35.278
Seven?

09:36.320 --> 09:40.154
My proximity transceiver
activated again.

09:42.360 --> 09:46.114
Someone is rerouting power
from the warp conduits.

09:46.280 --> 09:50.478
- To where?
- Deck 8, section 22. The science lab.

09:50.640 --> 09:53.234
Bridge to science lab.

09:53.400 --> 09:55.550
Ensign Mulchaey, respond.

09:55.720 --> 09:57.676
Harry.

09:58.720 --> 10:02.395
Sensors are being deflected
by a force field.

10:02.560 --> 10:05.233
The force field has a Borg signature.

10:05.400 --> 10:10.394
Red Alert. Captain to the bridge.
Take a security team to the lab.

10:10.560 --> 10:15.156
Seven of Nine, you were right.
We detected Borg in the science lab.

10:15.320 --> 10:18.551
- How many drones?
- Unknown. Tuvok's there.

10:18.720 --> 10:21.439
- I will join him.
- The science lab?

10:21.600 --> 10:23.556
My mobile emitter's in there.

10:51.680 --> 10:55.309
This technology resembles
a Borg maturation chamber,

10:55.480 --> 10:58.677
but many of the components
are unfamiliar.

10:58.840 --> 11:00.751
Commander.

11:05.720 --> 11:10.350
Punctured by an extraction tubule.
It removed a tissue sample.

11:11.240 --> 11:15.392
There are residual nanoprobes
surrounding the wound.

11:16.440 --> 11:19.398
Their encoding sequences
are identical to mine.

11:19.560 --> 11:21.516
Your nanoprobes? How?

11:22.960 --> 11:24.916
I don't know.

11:25.080 --> 11:27.036
Take him to sickbay.

11:41.680 --> 11:43.636
What are you doing?

11:43.800 --> 11:46.439
I will be recognised as Borg.

12:13.200 --> 12:17.318
A drone.
But unlike any I've ever seen.

12:18.320 --> 12:20.993
It appears to be in the foetal stage.

12:22.920 --> 12:25.992
I don't understand. The Borg assimilate.

12:26.160 --> 12:29.152
They do not reproduce in this fashion.

12:43.720 --> 12:45.676
Where did it come from?

12:45.840 --> 12:49.196
I believe it was created
in the science lab.

12:49.360 --> 12:53.717
When the away team beamed back
the transporter malfunctioned.

12:53.880 --> 12:56.075
The patterns merged briefly.

12:56.240 --> 13:00.233
My nanoprobes might have infected
the Doctor's emitter.

13:00.400 --> 13:02.356
They began to assimilate?

13:02.520 --> 13:06.638
Nanoprobes utilise any technology
they encounter.

13:06.800 --> 13:10.998
It assimilated the emitter
and began to transform this station.

13:11.160 --> 13:13.594
They sampled Mulchaey's DNA.

13:13.760 --> 13:18.072
Using his genetic code as a template
to create a life-form.

13:24.440 --> 13:27.318
The drone has increased in mass
by 17%.

13:27.480 --> 13:31.314
Its maturation rate is 25 times
that of a conventional Borg.

13:31.480 --> 13:35.837
Tuvok, erect a level-10 force field
around this section.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.468
Post round-the-clock security.

13:38.640 --> 13:41.029
You intend to let it mature?

13:41.880 --> 13:46.635
The alternative is to pull the plug.
I'm not prepared to do that.

13:46.800 --> 13:51.430
Resume your analysis.
I want to know what we're dealing with.

13:51.600 --> 13:55.195
- Or should I say, "whom"?
- Yes, Captain.

13:59.320 --> 14:03.472
I've adapted the sensors
to penetrate the Borg force field.

14:03.640 --> 14:07.713
- You said this thing was a foetus.
- An hour ago it was.

14:08.680 --> 14:11.797
The drone has entered
the fourth phase of gestation.

14:11.960 --> 14:18.513
- In human terms, a child of six years.
- 'A boy of six years. The drone is male.

14:18.680 --> 14:22.593
Route your sensor data to sickbay.
I want to run a few scans.

14:23.400 --> 14:24.992
Stand by.

14:27.040 --> 14:30.271
He appears to be human,
for the most part.

14:31.200 --> 14:35.796
Borg implants comprise approximately
27% of his body.

14:35.960 --> 14:39.669
His body plate is composed
of polydeutonic alloy.

14:39.840 --> 14:42.035
Just like my mobile emitter.

14:42.200 --> 14:46.796
The nanoprobes must have extrapolated
that technology.

14:46.960 --> 14:51.317
Wait a second.
The emitter came from the 29th century.

14:51.480 --> 14:53.675
It's advanced by 500 years.

14:53.840 --> 14:58.038
It is logical to assume this drone
will be equally advanced.

14:58.200 --> 15:01.033
- A 29th century Borg.
- In essence.

15:01.200 --> 15:06.228
I've located my mobile emitter.
It's embedded in his cerebral cortex.

15:06.400 --> 15:10.632
It's been adapted to function as part
of his central nervous system.

15:10.800 --> 15:15.828
- It controls autonomic functions.
- If we remove it, we kill the drone.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.912
- Has it contacted the collective?
- No.

15:19.080 --> 15:22.311
- I've dampened its transceiver.
- For now.

15:22.480 --> 15:24.835
What about when it grows up?

15:28.920 --> 15:33.198
Reactive body armour,
multidimensional adaptability.

15:33.360 --> 15:37.831
- lnternal transporter nodes?
- It has superior technology.

15:38.000 --> 15:41.595
It will fully mature in less than two hours.

15:41.760 --> 15:44.320
We can still terminate it.

15:44.480 --> 15:47.472
Hold on a minute, I want some answers.

15:47.640 --> 15:51.235
What happens when a drone
disengages from the chamber?

15:51.400 --> 15:57.191
- It awaits the collective's instructions.
- It has no designation without them.

15:57.360 --> 15:59.316
- No purpose.
- Correct.

16:00.600 --> 16:05.958
If we can keep him from the collective,
we can give him a purpose.

16:06.120 --> 16:07.155
Captain.

16:07.320 --> 16:10.869
This is the most advanced drone
ever to exist.

16:11.040 --> 16:16.797
We could teach him our values,
what it means to be an individual.

16:16.960 --> 16:22.557
If it were to be assimilated,
the collective would be more powerful.

16:22.720 --> 16:26.599
What I'm proposing
is the only defence against that,

16:26.760 --> 16:31.276
short of murder,
and that's an order I prefer not to give.

16:31.480 --> 16:33.516
As I recall, Seven,

16:33.680 --> 16:38.435
there were a few crewmembers
who had similar doubts about you.

16:38.600 --> 16:40.670
- This is different.
- Is it?

16:40.840 --> 16:43.798
A Borg, disconnected
from the collective,

16:43.960 --> 16:46.190
unsure of its identity.

16:46.360 --> 16:49.716
A potential threat, but we succeeded.

16:49.880 --> 16:54.590
We'll pull the same trick again.
Only this time, you're the teacher.

16:54.760 --> 16:58.116
I am to instruct the drone
in the ways of humanity?

16:58.280 --> 17:00.510
Think of it as first contact.

17:01.840 --> 17:03.990
And you are our ambassador.

17:27.760 --> 17:30.228
Maturation cycle is complete.

17:41.360 --> 17:44.352
We are Borg. State our designation.

17:44.520 --> 17:47.910
Irrelevant.
You are not part of the collective.

17:48.080 --> 17:52.312
You are an individual.
You receive instructions from me.

17:52.480 --> 17:55.313
- lnsufficient.
- You must comply.

17:55.480 --> 17:57.471
Insufficient.

17:59.400 --> 18:01.470
We are Borg.

18:02.680 --> 18:07.037
My designation is Seven of Nine,
Tertiary Adjunct of Unimatrix Zero One.

18:07.200 --> 18:10.431
- You may call me Seven of Nine.
- Seven of Nine.

18:10.600 --> 18:14.878
- You will comply with my commands.
- Seven of Nine.

18:15.040 --> 18:16.837
Yes.

18:17.000 --> 18:20.310
We are not Borg.
We are individuals.

18:20.480 --> 18:23.711
- Do you understand?
- State our designation.

18:23.880 --> 18:28.874
- Apparently not.
- lts responses are programmed.

18:29.040 --> 18:30.996
It doesn't understand.

18:31.160 --> 18:34.311
I must initiate a direct neural interface.

18:34.480 --> 18:38.314
- Are you sure that's wise?
- There is no other way.

18:39.480 --> 18:41.232
Proceed.

18:45.120 --> 18:47.588
You will not be harmed.

18:48.640 --> 18:51.200
Resistance is futile.

18:58.640 --> 19:01.108
I am providing it with instructions.

19:04.960 --> 19:06.712
It understands.

19:08.600 --> 19:11.592
The drone is probing
my neural pathways.

19:13.120 --> 19:17.636
It is trying to assimilate all of
my knowledge. I cannot disengage.

19:19.480 --> 19:21.596
Terminate interface.

19:24.440 --> 19:28.194
You must comply. You are hurting me.

19:33.520 --> 19:35.556
I will comply.

19:46.240 --> 19:48.470
Daily log, Seven of Nine.

19:48.640 --> 19:52.758
I've activated the drone's
linguistic database.

19:52.920 --> 19:58.233
A direct neural link is too dangerous
so I'll use Borg data nodes.

19:58.400 --> 20:01.233
Special delivery, two Borg data nodes.

20:01.400 --> 20:04.551
More? Link them to the data port.

20:05.600 --> 20:09.479
How many Borg hitchhikers
are we going to pick up?

20:09.640 --> 20:14.350
Maybe this is the Borg's new strategy.
Show up and look helpless.

20:14.520 --> 20:15.669
Now, B'Elanna.

20:15.840 --> 20:20.231
What will it become?
It's gone from infant to adult in one day.

20:20.400 --> 20:22.914
It will become what we help it to become.

20:23.080 --> 20:24.832
How Starfleet of you.

20:25.000 --> 20:30.438
Seven of Nine to Neelix. Report to the
science lab. Bring the first data node.

20:30.600 --> 20:32.352
On my way.

20:44.640 --> 20:48.189
We are Borg. State our designation.

20:48.360 --> 20:53.309
I've compiled information
into this data node for you to assimilate.

20:53.480 --> 20:57.712
- We do not understand.
- You will. Assimilate the data.

20:57.880 --> 21:00.269
Come here.

21:00.440 --> 21:02.192
Comply.

21:05.200 --> 21:07.156
Give me your arm.

21:13.640 --> 21:18.111
Inject the data node
with an assimilation tubule, here.

21:18.280 --> 21:20.475
We do not understand.

21:50.720 --> 21:53.712
- Your designation is Seven of Nine.
- Yes.

21:55.280 --> 21:58.670
- Your designation is Neelix.
- That's me.

22:01.560 --> 22:04.677
This is a laboratory. On a vessel.

22:04.840 --> 22:06.831
The starship Voyager.

22:07.000 --> 22:10.788
- I am travelling through space.
- Yes.

22:12.120 --> 22:14.998
- Why?
- This is a ship of exploration.

22:16.840 --> 22:19.638
- I am an explorer.
- We all are.

22:19.800 --> 22:22.234
- We are Borg.
- Well, no.

22:22.400 --> 22:25.392
You are a unique individual.
One of many.

22:25.560 --> 22:29.394
This is not a Borg collective.
Do you understand?

22:30.680 --> 22:33.717
Individual. My thoughts are my own.

22:33.880 --> 22:35.996
Precisely.

22:36.160 --> 22:39.152
- I wish to assimilate more information.
- Not yet.

22:39.320 --> 22:42.869
Neural pathways require time
to process information.

22:43.040 --> 22:45.554
You will need to regenerate soon.

22:45.720 --> 22:49.429
I will adapt one of the alcoves
to your technology.

22:49.600 --> 22:53.593
Take the drone to the Doctor for
medical analysis. Go with him.

22:58.960 --> 23:03.750
All members of this crew must report
to the sickbay for evaluation.

23:07.480 --> 23:10.711
When I am finished here, I will join you.

23:15.480 --> 23:19.553
Duranium hull.
Plasma-based power distribution.

23:19.720 --> 23:24.396
Tricylic life-support systems.
Artificial gravity plating.

23:24.560 --> 23:28.235
Right. Systems analysis
appears to be your forte.

23:28.400 --> 23:31.915
- Think about a future in operations.
- Human. Female.

23:32.080 --> 23:33.638
Very good.

23:33.800 --> 23:36.837
- She was frightened.
- Why do you say that?

23:37.000 --> 23:39.958
I detected an elevation
in her response.

23:40.120 --> 23:44.193
An unfamiliar face
takes some getting used to.

23:44.360 --> 23:48.478
When I first came aboard
I provoked strange reactions.

23:48.640 --> 23:52.076
I still do. Just look at me.
Whiskers and spots.

23:52.240 --> 23:55.118
- Were people afraid of you as well?
- No.

23:55.280 --> 23:57.350
Do they fear me because I am Borg?

23:57.520 --> 24:01.957
Borg can be a little intimidating.
Don't take it personally.

24:02.120 --> 24:05.669
- I want to know about the collective.
- Of course.

24:05.840 --> 24:08.035
- Tell me.
- What's to tell.

24:08.240 --> 24:12.119
You've seen one enhanced species
you've seen them all.

24:12.280 --> 24:14.874
You'll have plenty of time to learn.

24:15.040 --> 24:19.079
First give yourself a chance
to adapt to life on Voyager.

24:19.240 --> 24:22.915
Now, Mr... In all the excitement
I forgot your name.

24:23.080 --> 24:26.709
- I do not have a name.
- Every individual needs a name.

24:26.880 --> 24:30.873
We can't call you "the drone".
That's not interesting.

24:31.040 --> 24:34.316
- Seven of Nine says it is irrelevant.
- I disagree.

24:34.480 --> 24:38.519
You should choose a name.
Something that defines you.

24:38.680 --> 24:40.671
There's only one of you.

24:40.840 --> 24:42.990
- One.
- Here we are. Sickbay.

24:46.200 --> 24:48.156
Good morning.

24:48.320 --> 24:51.949
- Emergency Medical Hologram.
- You are observant.

24:52.120 --> 24:55.954
- Step this way.
- I have to get back to mess hall.

24:56.120 --> 25:01.433
There's nothing to worry about.
You'll be finished before you know it.

25:01.600 --> 25:03.352
I will comply.

25:06.240 --> 25:10.677
It's a non-invasive biomedical scan.
You won't feel a thing.

25:12.120 --> 25:14.839
Normal central nervous system.

25:15.000 --> 25:19.835
But there's degradation in your neural
pathways. You'll need to regenerate.

25:20.000 --> 25:23.549
My central nervous system
is regulated by your mobile emitter.

25:23.720 --> 25:25.472
That's right.

25:25.640 --> 25:30.350
- It is more advanced than these tools.
- Far more advanced.

25:30.520 --> 25:34.479
It came from the 29th Century,
400 years in the future.

25:34.640 --> 25:37.712
- I am an advanced form of life.
- Yes.

25:37.880 --> 25:39.632
I am unique.

25:39.800 --> 25:42.394
- Describe my origins.
- Long story.

25:42.560 --> 25:46.030
I wish to hear it.
I wish to hear the story. Now.

25:49.280 --> 25:52.033
There was a transporter malfunction.

25:52.200 --> 25:57.228
My emitter fused with several
of Seven of Nine's nanoprobes.

25:57.400 --> 26:01.951
- I was an accident.
- A random convergence of technology.

26:02.120 --> 26:04.315
Am I unwelcome here?

26:06.880 --> 26:11.874
On the contrary. Our primary mission
is to explore new forms of life.

26:12.040 --> 26:16.909
You may have been unexpected,
but I'm sure you'll make a fine addition.

26:17.080 --> 26:20.390
You have my mobile emitter
driving your neocortex

26:20.560 --> 26:24.235
so you're bound to make
a dazzling impression.

26:25.400 --> 26:28.631
- That's called a joke.
- Joke.

26:28.800 --> 26:31.633
A comment designed
to provoke laughter.

26:31.800 --> 26:33.915
You have your mother's
sense of humour.

26:39.920 --> 26:44.710
Deck 11, section 32, main
engineering. That is the warp core.

26:44.880 --> 26:50.034
Fuelled by a reaction which produces
4000 teradynes per second,

26:50.200 --> 26:53.112
providing power for fast propulsion.

26:53.280 --> 26:56.352
- Correct.
- This isn't a classroom, Seven.

26:56.520 --> 26:59.910
Lieutenant Torres.
Klingon-human hybrid.

27:00.080 --> 27:04.756
She possesses extensive knowledge
and a volatile temperament.

27:04.920 --> 27:06.911
Volatile. English adjective.

27:07.080 --> 27:11.119
Meaning readily vaporisable.
Easily aroused.

27:11.280 --> 27:14.670
- Tending to eruption.
- You get a gold star.

27:14.840 --> 27:19.231
The captain asked me to familiarise
the drone with Voyager.

27:19.400 --> 27:23.552
How about familiarising him
with the airponics bay?

27:23.720 --> 27:27.713
I have to predict the expansion rate
of this protonebula

27:27.880 --> 27:31.156
or Janeway will pull the plug
on the survey.

27:31.320 --> 27:35.074
- Do you mind?
- A multispatial algorithm will work.

27:35.920 --> 27:37.876
I can demonstrate.

27:40.560 --> 27:42.312
All right.

27:52.720 --> 27:54.472
Amazing.

27:59.760 --> 28:02.513
Greetings. Our designation...

28:05.640 --> 28:09.189
My designation is One.
How are you today?

28:09.360 --> 28:11.669
I'm just fine, thank you.

28:11.840 --> 28:14.718
- One?
- He requested a designation.

28:14.880 --> 28:17.394
One seemed appropriate.

28:17.560 --> 28:21.519
- And how are you today, One?
- Well. Thank you, Captain.

28:21.680 --> 28:24.069
- Adapting to life here?
- Yes.

28:24.240 --> 28:29.360
I've assimilated 47 billion teraquads
of information on subjects

28:29.520 --> 28:34.116
including particle physics,
comparative humanoid anatomy,

28:34.280 --> 28:37.238
and culinary delights
of the Delta Quadrant.

28:37.400 --> 28:41.029
Mr Neelix. They've been
spending time together.

28:41.200 --> 28:45.557
Is your assessment of me complete?
Am I sufficient?

28:45.720 --> 28:50.589
More than sufficient.
In fact, you're making excellent progress.

28:50.760 --> 28:53.115
But this isn't an assessment.

28:53.280 --> 28:55.430
I would like to be excused.

28:55.600 --> 28:59.991
Lieutenant Torres wishes
to improve the Bussard collectors.

29:00.160 --> 29:02.515
Permission granted.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.992
- You've done a remarkable job.
- Thank you.

29:11.160 --> 29:15.073
He has absorbed
an incredible amount of knowledge,

29:15.240 --> 29:19.518
and he's fitting in and developing
a distinct personality.

29:19.680 --> 29:21.830
He is adapting quickly.

29:22.840 --> 29:26.435
Then why do I feel
something is bothering you?

29:26.600 --> 29:30.275
He has been expressing curiosity
about the Borg.

29:31.320 --> 29:35.757
You're worried if he learns about them
he may be drawn to the collective.

29:35.920 --> 29:37.876
Yes.

29:38.960 --> 29:43.829
We should tell him. I'd rather he learn
about the Borg from us.

29:44.000 --> 29:49.552
The lure of perfection is powerful.
He may want to seek them out.

29:49.720 --> 29:52.792
That would pose a grave tactical risk.

29:54.120 --> 29:57.476
We can delay telling him,
but keep in mind

29:57.640 --> 30:02.555
the drone is becoming an individual,
he has the right to know.

30:02.720 --> 30:06.474
Sooner or later we'll have
to answer his questions.

30:09.480 --> 30:14.793
Deck 8, section 4, cargo bay 2.
Used for storage of surplus materials.

30:14.960 --> 30:18.191
And where I regenerate.
You will reside here.

30:18.360 --> 30:22.353
- I wish to assimilate more information.
- It's enough for one day.

30:22.520 --> 30:25.830
You've also provided assistance
to the crew.

30:26.000 --> 30:30.516
- You exceeded expectations.
- Then they were insufficient.

30:30.680 --> 30:34.389
- A simple thank you would suffice.
- Thank you?

30:34.560 --> 30:39.031
A customary expression of gratitude.
I paid you a compliment.

30:39.200 --> 30:41.350
We must regenerate.

30:43.040 --> 30:47.352
This technology does not conform
with Starfleet parameters.

30:47.520 --> 30:50.034
I am Borg. This technology is Borg.

30:51.200 --> 30:55.796
- We must regenerate.
- I wish to assimilate all Borg data.

30:55.960 --> 30:58.428
Step into the alcove.

31:05.120 --> 31:07.714
No, you must face outward.

31:13.640 --> 31:18.430
Computer, activate regeneration cycle.
Alcoves beta and gamma.

31:20.600 --> 31:22.511
Seven of Nine.

31:23.560 --> 31:25.596
Yes.

31:25.760 --> 31:27.990
Thank you.

31:32.040 --> 31:33.359
We must regenerate.

31:57.400 --> 32:00.517
A Borg proximity signal
has been detected.

32:00.680 --> 32:03.638
Origin, Unimatrix 325.

32:03.800 --> 32:06.189
Grid, 006.

32:06.360 --> 32:08.510
Alter course to intercept.

32:21.360 --> 32:22.349
Captain?

32:22.520 --> 32:26.593
The drone transmitted a Borg
proximity signal. Wake him.

32:39.760 --> 32:42.593
- You contacted the collective?
- No.

32:42.760 --> 32:44.955
Check his transceiver.

32:45.120 --> 32:48.749
You deactivated my transceiver
two days ago.

32:52.600 --> 32:56.593
Your cranial implants created
a secondary transceiver.

32:56.760 --> 33:01.993
- A Borg fail-safe device.
- Have you detected any vessels?

33:02.160 --> 33:05.948
Long-range sensors picked up
a transwarp conduit.

33:06.120 --> 33:09.430
- A ship is approaching.
- Time to intercept?

33:09.600 --> 33:13.149
- Approximately three hours.
- The Borg?

33:13.320 --> 33:14.878
Yes.

33:16.080 --> 33:18.275
- I wish to meet them.
- Seven.

33:23.200 --> 33:28.115
I think it's time we showed our drone
what the Borg are all about.

33:35.840 --> 33:40.356
- They have assimilated many species.
- Correct.

33:40.520 --> 33:43.034
What becomes of those species?

33:43.200 --> 33:47.910
Their neural pathways are linked
to a collective mind - the hive.

33:48.080 --> 33:52.870
Their bodies augmented with technology.
They become drones.

33:53.040 --> 33:55.918
I wish to experience the hive mind.

33:56.080 --> 34:01.712
If you did, then you wouldn't be unique.
The Borg will destroy your individuality.

34:01.880 --> 34:06.556
- And that is...undesirable?
- Very.

34:07.720 --> 34:11.235
The Borg are the most
destructive force we know.

34:11.400 --> 34:16.076
They've assimilated billions of individuals
against their will.

34:16.239 --> 34:21.030
- You were assimilated.
- My link to the collective was severed.

34:21.199 --> 34:24.431
When you were in the collective
you assimilated others.

34:24.600 --> 34:26.158
Yes.

34:27.719 --> 34:29.949
You call the Borg destructive.

34:30.120 --> 34:33.668
- Seven of Nine is not.
- She has regained her individuality.

34:33.840 --> 34:38.277
If the Borg had the chance,
they'd take it away from her again.

34:38.440 --> 34:41.795
They'd assimilate
everyone on Voyager.

34:42.960 --> 34:48.273
With your technology, they would
become even more destructive.

34:48.440 --> 34:52.433
We have to prevent that,
but we can't do it without you.

34:52.600 --> 34:58.152
We need your abilities to enhance
our defences - shields, weapons.

34:58.320 --> 35:01.073
Will you help us resist them?

35:02.560 --> 35:07.190
Seven of Nine, do you wish
to rejoin the collective?

35:12.200 --> 35:14.077
Voyager is my collective.

35:17.080 --> 35:20.197
I will need time to assimilate
this information.

35:21.200 --> 35:24.510
Battle stations.
Borg vessel approaching.

35:24.680 --> 35:26.716
We just ran out of time.

35:35.080 --> 35:40.200
Seven of Nine, I'm detecting
irregularities in my nervous system.

35:40.360 --> 35:43.193
Cardiovascular excitation.

35:43.360 --> 35:47.319
You are experiencing anxiety.
It is only temporary.

35:47.480 --> 35:50.756
Anxiety. Apprehension caused by fear.

35:50.920 --> 35:55.038
- The Borg elicit this response.
- Are you anxious as well?

35:55.200 --> 35:57.794
Yes, along with every crewmember.

35:57.960 --> 36:01.999
- Because they fear assimilation?
- Correct. Deck 1.

36:05.960 --> 36:08.599
- Seven of Nine.
- Yes?

36:08.760 --> 36:13.072
- What will happen now?
- We will engage the Borg.

36:13.240 --> 36:16.118
Will Voyager be destroyed?

36:19.120 --> 36:23.477
The Borg are powerful,
but Captain Janeway is resourceful.

36:23.640 --> 36:27.110
- We will resist.
- Resistance is futile.

36:29.080 --> 36:30.832
Perhaps.

36:39.920 --> 36:43.435
- The Borg vessel is in range.
- On screen.

36:45.800 --> 36:51.830
Long-range tactical vessel. Transwarp
capability. Ablative hull armour.

36:52.000 --> 36:55.675
- We're being scanned.
- They're preparing to attack.

36:55.840 --> 37:00.994
You must help us enhance our shields.
Access the shield generators.

37:01.160 --> 37:04.789
- They're hailing us.
- Open a channel.

37:04.960 --> 37:08.475
We are the Borg.
You will be assimilated.

37:08.640 --> 37:11.154
Resistance is futile.

37:12.520 --> 37:15.193
I can hear them in my mind.

37:17.360 --> 37:21.911
- They've locked on a tractor beam.
- The collective is calling to me.

37:22.080 --> 37:24.150
I hear it, too.

37:25.320 --> 37:28.710
Billions of voices speaking as one.

37:33.560 --> 37:36.393
We must resist that voice.

37:36.560 --> 37:40.678
The crew of Voyager
will be destroyed if we don't.

37:45.520 --> 37:47.875
Our shields are remodulating.

37:53.120 --> 37:56.954
- We've broken free.
- Can you enhance our phasers?

37:57.120 --> 37:59.076
- Yes.
- Do it.

37:59.240 --> 38:02.915
When he has finished,
target their propulsion system.

38:03.080 --> 38:05.799
Be prepared to jump to warp, Mr Paris.

38:07.040 --> 38:09.918
Enhancements complete. You may fire.

38:15.360 --> 38:18.875
- What happened?
- They inverted our phaser beam.

38:19.880 --> 38:21.836
They took out our warp drive.

38:22.000 --> 38:27.074
Your technology is limited.
I cannot enhance it further.

38:27.240 --> 38:31.438
I must interface with them,
disrupt them from within.

38:31.600 --> 38:35.832
- They will try to assimilate you.
- They will fail.

38:39.600 --> 38:43.639
- Harry, lock on to the drone.
- That won't be necessary.

38:46.280 --> 38:48.953
He's inside the sphere.

38:49.120 --> 38:52.795
We are the Borg.
You will be assimilated.

38:52.960 --> 38:57.351
My technology is superior.
Stop your attack, or I will destroy you.

38:57.520 --> 39:01.425
Your technological distinctiveness
will be added to our own.

39:01.430 --> 39:04.076
Resistance is futile.

39:07.200 --> 39:09.156
Shields down to 25%.

39:17.200 --> 39:20.192
He's accessing
their navigational controls.

39:30.160 --> 39:32.993
It's heading directly for the nebula.

39:33.160 --> 39:35.390
Their hull will collapse.

39:38.160 --> 39:40.310
Terminate your interface.

39:55.680 --> 39:58.069
Stand down Red Alert.

39:58.240 --> 40:00.356
Tuvok, secure all stations.

40:00.520 --> 40:03.637
Organise damage control
teams, Chakotay.

40:06.000 --> 40:09.913
Captain, I'm reading a lifesign
in the debris.

40:10.080 --> 40:12.913
It's the drone. He survived.

40:18.440 --> 40:22.797
He's erected a multispatial force field,
but it is weakening.

40:22.960 --> 40:26.111
Get a lock on him.
Beam him to sickbay.

40:30.120 --> 40:33.715
- Damage?
- His implants are regenerating.

40:33.880 --> 40:36.235
But not his biological systems.

40:36.400 --> 40:41.679
Severe trauma to the cerebral cortex.
He needs immediate surgery.

40:41.840 --> 40:45.276
- The sphere?
- Destroyed.

40:45.440 --> 40:48.193
You were successful.

40:48.360 --> 40:53.878
While I was linked to the Borg
I could hear their thoughts,

40:54.040 --> 40:56.508
their objectives.

40:56.680 --> 41:01.549
They are aware of my existence.
They will pursue me.

41:01.720 --> 41:04.280
Irrelevant. They will fail.

41:04.440 --> 41:07.591
- I need to get started.
- No, I should not exist.

41:08.760 --> 41:13.197
I was an accident.
A random convergence of technology.

41:13.360 --> 41:17.717
- You are unique.
- I was never meant to be.

41:19.280 --> 41:22.875
As long as I exist, you are in danger.

41:23.720 --> 41:26.075
All life on Voyager is in danger.

41:26.240 --> 41:28.470
We can talk about this later.

41:30.800 --> 41:33.439
Allow the Doctor to proceed.

41:34.720 --> 41:38.599
- Lower the force field.
- His synapses are failing.

41:38.760 --> 41:41.911
- You must comply.
- I will not.

41:43.000 --> 41:45.673
You must comply.

41:45.840 --> 41:47.592
Please.

41:48.840 --> 41:50.796
You are hurting me.

41:52.160 --> 41:54.310
You will adapt.

42:14.840 --> 42:16.592
I'm sorry.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
