WEBVTT

00:03.100 --> 00:04.433
You fired.

00:04.433 --> 00:06.800
I'm happy to have my
one and only baby back home.

00:06.800 --> 00:08.700
Shouldn't be burying
no 22-year-old

00:08.700 --> 00:10.267
'cause he
went out to a club.

00:10.267 --> 00:12.167
I'll see you
in court, Counselor.

00:12.167 --> 00:13.667
If we lose the civil suit,

00:13.667 --> 00:16.033
the insurance ain't
gonna cover that.

00:17.267 --> 00:19.867
Smoke always said
you was funny.

00:19.867 --> 00:21.100
Damita, let me
holler at you.

00:21.100 --> 00:22.533
Yeah, what do you--

00:22.533 --> 00:24.067
Takes a real tough
motherfucker

00:24.067 --> 00:26.000
to hit a lady, right?

00:26.000 --> 00:27.167
Imani X is ready.

00:27.167 --> 00:28.433
Well, you tell her to
leave her demo.

00:28.433 --> 00:30.300
Geronimo ain't
coming back, Bruce.

00:30.300 --> 00:32.733
This shit ends today.
Truce.

00:32.733 --> 00:33.733
Number three.

00:33.733 --> 00:35.033
Run, bitch.

00:36.400 --> 00:38.667
Long as the law know how
dope we was a few weeks back,

00:38.667 --> 00:40.267
when we was here,
recording all day.

00:40.267 --> 00:41.600
Else there ain't
no "we."

00:41.600 --> 00:43.067
I don't know,
just something about you.

00:43.067 --> 00:44.800
Loyal, aren't you?
I try to be.

00:44.800 --> 00:46.100
It'll carry you far.

00:46.100 --> 00:47.633
That's my girl.

00:47.633 --> 00:48.600
Mom.

01:05.567 --> 01:07.767
Striking.
Thank you.

01:07.767 --> 01:09.467
I know you've gotten calls
from Cory Robbins

01:09.467 --> 01:10.667
and Bill Stephney.

01:10.667 --> 01:12.633
And Russell Simmons
and Will Socolov,

01:12.633 --> 01:14.400
just to name a few.

01:14.400 --> 01:15.867
Yeah, the difference
between them and you

01:15.867 --> 01:17.267
is they know rap.

01:17.267 --> 01:19.967
Well, we know how to take
rap to the next level.

01:19.967 --> 01:21.600
We can get your
client's music on the radio.

01:21.600 --> 01:23.133
They can't.

01:23.133 --> 01:24.800
And those independents...

01:24.800 --> 01:26.700
they're not prepared to
create what I believe will be

01:26.700 --> 01:28.833
the biggest phenomenon
since MC Hammer.

01:31.267 --> 01:32.533
Atlantic made us
an offer too.

01:32.533 --> 01:33.833
We'll beat it.

01:48.467 --> 01:50.167
Totally stay with me
as long as you like.

01:50.167 --> 01:51.400
Thanks.
Yeah.

01:51.400 --> 01:52.900
So, what are you gonna
do for work?

01:52.900 --> 01:54.367
I don't know,
I'll figure it out.

01:54.367 --> 01:55.567
I have no choice.

01:55.567 --> 01:57.900
You love me long time.

01:57.900 --> 02:00.267
That lyric sets
Asian feminist discourse

02:00.267 --> 02:01.800
back like 20 years.

02:01.800 --> 02:03.433
It doesn't do much
for the sisters either.

02:03.433 --> 02:04.933
Yeah.
Oh, speaking of,

02:04.933 --> 02:08.267
Damita getting Uncle Luke
as her first cover, huh?

02:08.267 --> 02:10.467
She's interviewing
Luther Campbell?

02:10.467 --> 02:11.867
Oh, you haven't
talked to her?

02:11.867 --> 02:14.500
I left a couple messages,
all of which she ignored.

02:14.500 --> 02:16.233
You should keep trying.

02:16.233 --> 02:19.133
For real.
Call her.

02:19.133 --> 02:20.433
Why do I have to
call her?

02:20.433 --> 02:22.633
Come on, just do it.
She played me.

02:24.067 --> 02:25.567
Ow.

02:25.567 --> 02:29.233
I told you to
stay out of it.

02:29.233 --> 02:31.800
Whatever.

02:31.800 --> 02:33.433
Ow, Damita,
what the fuck?

02:33.433 --> 02:35.367
That hurts you?

02:35.367 --> 02:37.533
Gordy could've
killed you.

02:37.533 --> 02:39.133
Whatever.

02:43.500 --> 02:45.067
Wait, where are
you going?

02:45.067 --> 02:46.467
You just got here.

02:46.467 --> 02:49.067
Yeah, I wanna get there early
and prep for my interview.

02:50.133 --> 02:52.800
Wish me luck?

02:52.800 --> 02:55.733
I wish you could
stay a little longer.

02:58.200 --> 03:00.167
Why?

03:01.933 --> 03:03.700
So I could
wish you good luck.

03:06.467 --> 03:09.600
Damn... you're just
dope.

03:09.600 --> 03:12.500
Mother, journalist...

03:12.500 --> 03:16.800
Shitty nurse.
Horrible nurse.

03:16.800 --> 03:18.767
What don't you do?

03:19.967 --> 03:21.933
Waste time.

03:21.933 --> 03:23.700
Hm.

03:28.500 --> 03:30.367
Ow, ow.
Oh-- oh, sorry.

03:30.367 --> 03:33.867
I'm sorry.
It's fine,
it's fine, it's fine.

03:41.633 --> 03:43.300
Like... so what's
the holdup?

03:43.300 --> 03:45.067
Hashim is the only
reason why I even got

03:45.067 --> 03:46.467
booked tonight
because he invited me.

03:46.467 --> 03:48.600
Nah, Hashim is not
the reason

03:48.600 --> 03:49.933
why you got
booked tonight.

03:49.933 --> 03:51.067
Your talent got you
the gig.

03:51.067 --> 03:52.967
You're doing
Mr. Hashim a favor.

03:52.967 --> 03:55.933
And I'm down.
Lil Ray, Josie and me,

03:55.933 --> 03:57.300
we're gonna be in
the house tonight.

03:57.300 --> 03:59.367
Okay, so where's
Nikki?

03:59.367 --> 04:01.933
Miss Jones and I
parted ways.

04:03.633 --> 04:05.367
So, when you getting
me in the studio?

04:05.367 --> 04:07.133
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.
I'm checking on it.

04:07.133 --> 04:09.367
I'm waiting to hear back
from this particular studio.

04:09.367 --> 04:10.700
They got Living Color
in there,

04:10.700 --> 04:12.067
so we're gonna get you
in there real soon--

04:12.067 --> 04:13.667
Barry, you know
I don't care about

04:13.667 --> 04:14.900
what studio I record--
Yeah, but I care

04:14.900 --> 04:16.733
about the studio.
I care about it.

04:16.733 --> 04:17.900
Man, when's shit
gonna pop?

04:17.900 --> 04:19.200
I need shit to pop.

04:19.200 --> 04:20.733
I know, right, right,
right, right.

04:20.733 --> 04:23.067
So listen, when you
get on the stage tonight,

04:23.067 --> 04:25.867
I want you to spit fire
out there.

04:25.867 --> 04:27.733
Kill the crowd.
Can you do that?

04:27.733 --> 04:28.867
I always do.

04:28.867 --> 04:30.467
You do.
You do, you do, you do.

04:30.467 --> 04:32.200
Good, good, good, good,
good, good.

04:32.200 --> 04:34.533
That's what the deal is.

04:34.533 --> 04:37.233
Thanks.

04:37.233 --> 04:38.567
Yo...

04:38.567 --> 04:40.567
John, John, John,
John, John.

04:40.567 --> 04:42.567
I need five aspirins.

04:42.567 --> 04:44.467
Five, yeah.

04:46.067 --> 04:48.367
Let's just say he
knows what he's holding.

04:48.367 --> 04:50.067
Yeah, I heard it.

04:50.067 --> 04:51.767
I'm telling you,
it's really--

04:51.767 --> 04:54.533
This way.
I'll call you back
in a minute.

04:54.533 --> 04:56.833
Miss Jones, how can
I help you today?

04:56.833 --> 04:58.500
Thank you so much
for meeting me.

04:58.500 --> 05:00.133
Please, take a seat.

05:02.067 --> 05:04.500
To what do I owe
this pleasure?

05:04.500 --> 05:07.433
I'm not with
Fouray anymore.

05:07.433 --> 05:10.067
I'd like to inquire about
a possible position.

05:11.100 --> 05:13.500
A&R, right?
To start.

05:13.500 --> 05:15.400
How's your ear
for talent?

05:15.400 --> 05:16.600
I'm told it's good.

05:16.600 --> 05:18.167
Hm.

05:18.167 --> 05:19.767
So, bring me an artist
worth signing

05:19.767 --> 05:22.100
and we'll talk about
a future for you here at EBJ.

05:22.100 --> 05:23.833
Thank you so much.
I-- I--

05:23.833 --> 05:27.500
Let's just see what
you come up with first.

05:27.500 --> 05:28.567
Now, if you'll
excuse me?

05:28.567 --> 05:30.867
Mm-hmm.

05:30.867 --> 05:34.200
Thank you.
And you're welcome.

05:36.400 --> 05:38.967
Well, wait, what do you mean,
you've closed the books?

05:38.967 --> 05:40.500
That's still my photo
on the album cover.

05:40.500 --> 05:42.500
You still
owe me the money.

05:42.500 --> 05:46.200
No... no, I can't wait
three more months, Larry.

05:46.200 --> 05:48.933
Film stock, new lenses.
I need the money now!

05:48.933 --> 05:52.267
You-- you know what, Larry?
Fuck you!

05:52.267 --> 05:54.500
Whoa.
What's up?

05:54.500 --> 05:57.267
That dick at Choice Records
won't pay me.

05:57.267 --> 05:58.800
That's the money
I needed to finish

05:58.800 --> 06:00.067
shooting the video
tonight.

06:00.067 --> 06:01.900
So, why don't you
just call Barry

06:01.900 --> 06:03.633
and have him pay for it?

06:03.633 --> 06:06.733
Barry just-- Barry just
needs to see the video.

06:06.733 --> 06:08.233
We'll get it on
Music Box

06:08.233 --> 06:09.767
and then he'll understand
how much he needs this.

06:09.767 --> 06:11.967
Fouray is just like
the rest of them.

06:11.967 --> 06:13.600
He make
a whole bunch of promises

06:13.600 --> 06:16.133
and never come through.

06:16.133 --> 06:17.933
I'm-- I'm really sorry.

06:17.933 --> 06:20.867
It's not your fault.
It's my fault.

06:20.867 --> 06:22.067
Oh, no.

06:22.067 --> 06:23.600
Look, I'll figure
something out.

06:23.600 --> 06:24.933
Don't worry,
I got this.

06:24.933 --> 06:27.100
I'm gonna get
you your video.

06:30.067 --> 06:31.800
Ladies and gentlemen,

06:31.800 --> 06:34.067
you are listening to
the sounds

06:34.067 --> 06:35.600
of the one,
the only...

06:35.600 --> 06:37.367
Ahm...

06:37.367 --> 06:41.433
...and super producer
DJ DeeVee!

06:41.433 --> 06:43.100
Yeah, rest in peace.

06:43.100 --> 06:44.567
My man David.

06:44.567 --> 06:47.733
Yeah, always remember
this moment, baby.

06:47.733 --> 06:48.967
Uh-huh, hey, yo, Ahm.

06:48.967 --> 06:50.233
Yeah.

06:50.233 --> 06:52.233
Talk to 'em
one time.
Yeah.

06:52.233 --> 06:53.767
Let 'em know...

06:59.733 --> 07:01.067
Hey.

07:01.067 --> 07:03.867
I'm sorry for tripping.

07:03.867 --> 07:05.267
My landlord is wiling,

07:05.267 --> 07:06.700
and my sister's
all up in my face,

07:06.700 --> 07:08.433
talking about my mom need
new insulin needles,

07:08.433 --> 07:10.233
and I ain't know
who else to call.
You good.

07:10.233 --> 07:12.167
You need something,
you call me, all right?

07:21.933 --> 07:23.800
I'm working a double
on Saturday

07:23.800 --> 07:25.067
so I'm gonna
hit you back.

07:25.067 --> 07:27.200
You don't need to
do that.

07:27.200 --> 07:30.067
I got some
Chinese in the fridge.

07:32.700 --> 07:35.400
You want some soda?

07:35.400 --> 07:36.667
Yeah.

07:43.200 --> 07:45.133
All right, well,
I'll try to stop by later

07:45.133 --> 07:46.600
if my mom can take
the baby.

07:46.600 --> 07:47.967
Please do.

07:47.967 --> 07:49.167
Okay.
Okay.

07:49.167 --> 07:51.067
Wait, wait,
wait, wait.

07:52.533 --> 07:54.367
Rest up.

07:54.367 --> 07:56.333
Okay.

08:04.633 --> 08:06.300
Goodness.

08:06.300 --> 08:08.333
That woman.

08:26.900 --> 08:28.800
Couldn't wait?
Mr. Van Putten?

08:28.800 --> 08:31.633
Detective Purdell, NYPD.
Got a minute?

08:31.633 --> 08:34.067
Name was Tina.

08:35.133 --> 08:37.067
She crossed paths
with your friend,

08:37.067 --> 08:38.967
Ahmed Harris,
and someone else

08:38.967 --> 08:42.633
you might know,
goes by Scooby.

08:42.633 --> 08:45.800
Poor lady.
She was intimidated.

08:45.800 --> 08:47.900
Refused to work
with the NYPD,

08:47.900 --> 08:50.133
and things still
didn't go so well for her.

08:52.067 --> 08:53.967
I can protect you,

08:53.967 --> 08:56.733
but you gotta make
a decision,

08:56.733 --> 08:59.267
sooner rather than later.

09:14.867 --> 09:17.600
What?
Nothing.

09:17.600 --> 09:19.467
I'm just surprised
that you called.

09:19.467 --> 09:21.133
You know, I heard
you went back home

09:21.133 --> 09:23.067
and I didn't think you'd
be coming back so soon.

09:23.067 --> 09:24.967
Me neither.

09:24.967 --> 09:28.233
Okay, so why'd
you come back?

09:28.233 --> 09:29.967
I don't know, it just
didn't feel right.

09:29.967 --> 09:31.800
Nah, I feel you.

09:31.800 --> 09:35.333
Sometimes it takes a minute
to figure out what's right.

09:38.767 --> 09:39.967
Right?

09:39.967 --> 09:42.633
Yeah.

09:42.633 --> 09:44.333
What, you looking
for work?

09:44.333 --> 09:45.867
Looking.

09:45.867 --> 09:47.667
How are things?

09:47.667 --> 09:51.733
You know...
Fouray's a mess, like usual.

09:51.733 --> 09:53.300
Yeah?
Yeah.

09:53.300 --> 09:55.733
Yo, homey, OD'd.
I had to call in a favor

09:55.733 --> 09:57.267
and everything to get
him squared away.

09:57.267 --> 09:59.067
Shit, he okay?
He's cool.

09:59.067 --> 10:02.467
You know,
he's all right.

10:02.467 --> 10:04.067
How's Imani?
Is she recording?

10:04.067 --> 10:06.533
Is she in the studio?

10:06.533 --> 10:08.067
Nah.

10:09.500 --> 10:12.367
So, we gonna talk about
what happened or what?

10:14.500 --> 10:17.067
I can't.

10:17.067 --> 10:20.133
Not yet.
Not yet.

10:22.367 --> 10:26.167
All right.
Cool.

10:26.167 --> 10:27.933
I do like
the hair, though.

10:27.933 --> 10:30.367
Oh, I know you
like the hair.
Oh, you know
I like the hair.

10:30.367 --> 10:32.067
I know you like the hair.
That's why you did it, huh?

10:39.067 --> 10:42.100
Hey, Dad.
It's, uh, it's me.

10:42.100 --> 10:45.267
Uh, hopefully
you get this.

10:45.267 --> 10:46.733
I think you're right
about Onondaga.

10:46.733 --> 10:50.167
I think-- I think
I gotta leave... today.

10:50.167 --> 10:52.333
Something crazy just happened

10:52.333 --> 10:54.733
and I'm a little
shaken up,

10:54.733 --> 10:57.200
so, uh, when you get this,

10:57.200 --> 10:59.533
can you please just meet me
at the "Village Voice"?

10:59.533 --> 11:02.133
I gotta go say goodbye
to somebody.

11:02.133 --> 11:04.333
Peace.

11:17.333 --> 11:19.500
Yo, Prep School.

11:24.167 --> 11:25.600
What's up?

11:25.600 --> 11:27.500
You know, man, we was
just rolling by

11:27.500 --> 11:30.433
your pop's crib,
we was in the neighborhood.

11:30.433 --> 11:33.867
That's-- that's dope.
I'll-- I'll see you around.

11:33.867 --> 11:36.200
Where you headed, man?

11:36.200 --> 11:37.900
I'm just going to
the Ride.

11:37.900 --> 11:39.267
The radio!

11:39.267 --> 11:41.167
We was just
going that way.

11:41.167 --> 11:43.067
Hop in.

11:43.067 --> 11:44.733
Nah, I can make my--

11:44.733 --> 11:47.267
Come on, man.
Get in the car.

12:13.267 --> 12:15.333
No, bitch,
where you been?

12:15.333 --> 12:17.233
And this hair.

12:17.233 --> 12:18.800
Got a new cut and shit.

12:18.800 --> 12:20.667
I had to go back home
to help my mom.

12:20.667 --> 12:22.233
Oh, word?
Is she good?
She good.

12:22.233 --> 12:23.400
All right.

12:23.400 --> 12:25.300
Yo, you need to get back
with Fouray.

12:25.300 --> 12:26.633
What the fuck
is up with him?

12:26.633 --> 12:28.233
He been holding off on me
getting in the studio.

12:28.233 --> 12:29.767
Yo, really?
Word.

12:29.767 --> 12:31.933
He... he was short on
my check last week,

12:31.933 --> 12:33.867
but I didn't think it
was affecting his artists.

12:33.867 --> 12:35.767
No worries.
I'm sure he'll be cooking

12:35.767 --> 12:37.233
the books by tomorrow,
I'm sure.

12:37.233 --> 12:39.067
Yeah, he better get
his shit together.

12:39.067 --> 12:41.400
Yo, it's been a minute.
What's up with you?

12:41.400 --> 12:43.567
You know, me and Hashim
going to Carwash tonight.

12:43.567 --> 12:45.067
Put you on this list
or what?

12:45.067 --> 12:46.500
Yes, count me in.

12:46.500 --> 12:49.300
Yo, I would love to get
a plus-one if I could.

12:49.300 --> 12:52.467
I'll see what
I can do.

12:52.467 --> 12:55.400
21 letters.
Ronald Daniel Henricson.

12:55.400 --> 12:57.500
And I was hoping
to add "Junior"

12:57.500 --> 12:59.700
and a coma,
so that's another seven.

12:59.700 --> 13:04.433
Also, birthday,
date of death.

13:04.433 --> 13:06.800
I never figured
a headstone inscription

13:06.800 --> 13:08.067
would be so costly.

13:08.067 --> 13:09.867
Hm.

13:09.867 --> 13:11.833
I wanna settle.

13:14.100 --> 13:18.533
A settlement
is a compromise.

13:18.533 --> 13:21.400
The incident needs
to be heard in court

13:21.400 --> 13:23.933
for a determination
of final justice.

13:23.933 --> 13:26.500
What about forgiveness?

13:26.500 --> 13:28.800
Your brother deserves
a full reckoning.

13:28.800 --> 13:31.667
Ronny deserves
to be buried.

13:46.567 --> 13:48.200
Shit, man, you don't
need the money?

13:48.200 --> 13:50.467
What you doing this for?

13:50.467 --> 13:53.933
A lawsuit ain't gonna bring
no one up out the grave.

14:05.800 --> 14:07.667
Ernesto Sierra, line one.

14:07.667 --> 14:09.567
Take a message.
Okay.

14:09.567 --> 14:12.200
You should take that.
I'm not interested.

14:12.200 --> 14:13.800
Sierra's artists
is wack.

14:13.800 --> 14:15.600
Well, Mattie Taylor
doesn't think so.

14:15.600 --> 14:17.367
Listen, like I told you, man,
I'm not feeling this plan.

14:17.367 --> 14:18.700
Well, be that
as it may, sir,

14:18.700 --> 14:20.433
you don't have much
of a choice.

14:20.433 --> 14:22.667
So, whenever you decide
to settle on a name

14:22.667 --> 14:24.267
for the label of
the company or whatever,

14:24.267 --> 14:26.067
just make sure it doesn't
include "Fouray."

14:26.067 --> 14:28.300
So, what am I supposed
to call it then?
Anything but "Fouray."

14:28.300 --> 14:30.300
But Fouray
is my name.
Exactly.

14:30.300 --> 14:31.667
Listen, I came in
this world a Fouray,

14:31.667 --> 14:33.333
I'm gonna leave this world
a Fouray, too.

14:33.333 --> 14:35.100
Fuck this
bankruptcy bullshit.

14:35.100 --> 14:36.500
What I need is some cash.

14:36.500 --> 14:39.133
I was supposed to have Imani
in the studio yesterday.

14:39.133 --> 14:40.233
It ain't a good look.

14:40.233 --> 14:42.600
First step: bankruptcy.

14:42.600 --> 14:44.067
Second step--
No.

14:44.067 --> 14:46.133
The first step is Imani.

14:46.133 --> 14:47.467
I'll find
the money.

14:47.467 --> 14:49.267
You have to be
realistic, man.

14:49.267 --> 14:51.900
Look, I'm not gonna
go bankrupt.

14:51.900 --> 14:54.467
Since when do I like
bank on failure?

14:54.467 --> 14:55.667
I'm trying to help you.

14:55.667 --> 14:57.733
It's not about banking
on failure.

14:57.733 --> 15:00.700
Good.
Then we done.

15:06.067 --> 15:09.367
Let's be clear.

15:09.367 --> 15:11.167
You lose this case,
it's over.

15:11.167 --> 15:12.733
You lose everything.

15:12.733 --> 15:14.667
Well, that means you
better win this damn case.

15:14.667 --> 15:16.467
And if for some reason,
you're feeling like

15:16.467 --> 15:18.567
you're not capable
of winning this case,

15:18.567 --> 15:20.800
then, Mr. Anders,
you need to let me know,

15:20.800 --> 15:22.267
'cause then I'll
get my ass out there

15:22.267 --> 15:23.800
and find a lawyer
who can.

15:23.800 --> 15:27.333
Sure you will, Barry.
Good day.

15:31.933 --> 15:34.200
It's like a fucking
Rubik's cube.

15:34.200 --> 15:37.200
Figure out one side,
the other side all fucked up.

15:37.200 --> 15:39.067
I feel you.
Yeah, but, look,

15:39.067 --> 15:42.067
SRR needs an extra $1,600
for tonight's showcase,

15:42.067 --> 15:44.567
and hair and makeup says they
need an extra room to set up in.

15:44.567 --> 15:46.700
Yo, look, B,
maybe I can come back

15:46.700 --> 15:48.467
another time, all right?
No.

15:48.467 --> 15:50.367
Now is the right time.
Right now.

15:50.367 --> 15:54.633
Actually... I need you
to call your man, the hookup.

15:57.500 --> 15:58.767
No, no, no,
you don't wanna do that.

15:58.767 --> 16:00.300
That's some serious shit, B.

16:00.300 --> 16:01.467
This is some
serious shit!

16:01.467 --> 16:03.733
Are you crazy?

16:03.733 --> 16:05.633
You don't have anybody else
that you can call?

16:09.167 --> 16:10.567
Nobody?

16:14.533 --> 16:15.900
Shit.

16:28.067 --> 16:29.900
Hey, Mattie, it's Nikki.

16:29.900 --> 16:32.900
Uh, I was calling to invite you
to a show tonight.

16:32.900 --> 16:34.700
Sounds lovely,
but I'm already booked

16:34.700 --> 16:37.133
for 2 Live Crew.

16:37.133 --> 16:38.400
How funny.

16:38.400 --> 16:39.800
That's the show
I was talking about.

16:39.800 --> 16:42.900
Maybe I'll see you there.

16:42.900 --> 16:46.067
Hope so.

16:53.633 --> 16:57.433
Hmm... you know
what I miss?

16:57.433 --> 16:58.800
What?

17:02.567 --> 17:05.200
When things was nice.

17:07.200 --> 17:08.500
Yeah.

17:10.200 --> 17:13.800
Smoke used to always talk
about your skills.

17:13.800 --> 17:17.967
How you be spitting.
His eyes would light up.

17:17.967 --> 17:22.067
The only other time I seen
that twinkle in his eye...

17:23.633 --> 17:28.733
was when it was just me,
him and the baby.

17:32.133 --> 17:35.133
I should've took
a photo or something.

18:00.733 --> 18:02.633
So, what you got
going on after this?

18:02.633 --> 18:05.600
You meeting up
with anyone?

18:05.600 --> 18:07.700
Nope.
Good.

18:07.700 --> 18:09.600
'Cause I'm taking it
upon myself to get you

18:09.600 --> 18:11.900
to the police station,
all right?

18:11.900 --> 18:14.300
Time to quit procrastinating
on all this alibi business.

18:14.300 --> 18:17.100
You feel me?

18:17.100 --> 18:19.100
Yeah, no doubt.

18:21.533 --> 18:23.367
Hey, you just missed
the ex--

18:23.367 --> 18:26.900
He knows where
he's going.

18:26.900 --> 18:28.633
So, you and Ahm,
y'all about to put out

18:28.633 --> 18:31.400
a record together
or something?

18:31.400 --> 18:33.533
Nah.

18:33.533 --> 18:35.067
I don't know, maybe.

18:35.067 --> 18:37.900
What you mean,
you don't know, man?

18:40.300 --> 18:43.067
Hey, I could, uh,
get to the station myself.

18:43.067 --> 18:46.200
Relax, man.
We good.

18:48.967 --> 18:52.167
You must've really fucked
with that nigga Ahm, yo.

18:52.167 --> 18:54.467
'Cause you about to
put it all on the line

18:54.467 --> 18:56.067
with that alibi.

18:57.167 --> 18:58.867
Shit.

18:58.867 --> 19:01.733
You know,
that's appreciated.

19:01.733 --> 19:03.833
I know many
a nigga who stood tall

19:03.833 --> 19:05.500
and still got murdered.

19:05.500 --> 19:07.300
'Cause motherfuckers
got worried

19:07.300 --> 19:08.567
they was gonna cop a plea

19:08.567 --> 19:10.733
even after they
signed the paper.

19:10.733 --> 19:12.167
See, some niggas would
rather dime

19:12.167 --> 19:14.767
than even think
about the possibility.

19:17.600 --> 19:19.800
But our Prep School,

19:19.800 --> 19:22.267
he gonna do the right thing
'cause he know Ahm

19:22.267 --> 19:24.900
gonna do right by him.

19:24.900 --> 19:27.300
Ain't that right,
Prep School?

19:30.667 --> 19:32.800
Yeah.

19:40.533 --> 19:42.300
Hey.

19:42.300 --> 19:44.467
Hey.

19:44.467 --> 19:47.733
What are you
doing here?

19:47.733 --> 19:50.233
I'm here to meet, uh...

19:51.867 --> 19:55.167
Oh my God,
what happened?

19:55.167 --> 19:58.567
Turns out that Gordy
didn't like my article either.

19:58.567 --> 20:01.433
He-- what the fuck?

20:01.433 --> 20:03.733
I'm over it.
No, fuck that.

20:03.733 --> 20:05.367
Nah, I just
wanna move on.

20:05.367 --> 20:07.133
Did you press charges?

20:07.133 --> 20:08.600
I don't need
a pity party.

20:08.600 --> 20:10.233
You need to
tell the truth.

20:10.233 --> 20:12.700
Really?
A lot of good it gets me.

20:12.700 --> 20:14.000
This is not about
the article.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.033
No man should put
their hands on you-- period.

20:18.600 --> 20:22.467
Look... I am really
sorry about what happened.

20:22.467 --> 20:24.700
Don't be.
You spoke the real.

20:24.700 --> 20:25.967
Fouray's a shithead.

20:25.967 --> 20:28.167
Let's just put it
behind us, cool?

20:28.167 --> 20:29.700
Cool.

20:31.933 --> 20:33.200
You wanna get a drink?

20:33.200 --> 20:36.133
Yes.
I really need one.

20:36.133 --> 20:37.867
Me too.

20:39.567 --> 20:42.500
You've done a lot
with the place.

20:42.500 --> 20:45.067
All these people
working for you.

20:45.067 --> 20:48.000
I'm impressed.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.867
Mm, actually, that's...

20:50.867 --> 20:52.333
that's why I wanted
to bring you down here,

20:52.333 --> 20:55.200
so you can see what
I've been working on.

20:55.200 --> 20:57.933
Oh, please.
I'm an old man.

20:57.933 --> 21:00.067
What else do I have to do?

21:00.067 --> 21:02.067
You know, I have
to stop your mother

21:02.067 --> 21:03.500
from telling everyone

21:03.500 --> 21:05.800
about the big check
our son gave us.

21:05.800 --> 21:07.900
That woman
and her mouth.

21:07.900 --> 21:10.167
We're gonna get robbed.

21:10.167 --> 21:14.133
You know, Pop,
about that money, um,

21:14.133 --> 21:15.633
like I said, you know,
you can tell,

21:15.633 --> 21:16.933
I've been working
like crazy down here

21:16.933 --> 21:18.833
to get this going and...

21:18.833 --> 21:20.533
I know I told
y'all not to worry about

21:20.533 --> 21:23.567
all the stuff you've been
seeing on the news.

21:23.567 --> 21:25.200
But, uh, it's just...

21:25.200 --> 21:27.933
What is it, son?

21:27.933 --> 21:29.933
Well, I'm gonna
need to borrow

21:29.933 --> 21:33.067
some of that money back,
but just for a little bit.

21:33.067 --> 21:34.700
You know, I've got
this artist--

21:34.700 --> 21:37.667
my artist, my label,

21:37.667 --> 21:39.567
and-- and--
and with all the things

21:39.567 --> 21:41.067
that's going on right now,

21:41.067 --> 21:43.567
I'm just a little
short on cash.

21:43.567 --> 21:45.467
You missed Sunday dinner.

21:45.467 --> 21:47.167
The last time
that happened--
I know.

21:47.167 --> 21:51.067
I told you, I'm sorry, Pop,
but those days are done.

21:51.067 --> 21:56.100
Now I'm focusing on
my label, and that's it.

21:57.167 --> 21:58.867
I just want you
to be okay.

21:58.867 --> 22:00.367
I'm okay, Pop.

22:00.367 --> 22:03.067
I just need this money
to cover my bases

22:03.067 --> 22:04.800
for the next few weeks,

22:04.800 --> 22:06.867
and then I'm gonna sign
my distribution deal

22:06.867 --> 22:09.333
and... and then
I'll be fine.

22:13.267 --> 22:15.067
Okay.

22:19.500 --> 22:21.833
How much
do you need?

22:27.500 --> 22:30.633
We say dirty words,
but everybody say dirty words.

22:30.633 --> 22:32.067
Obscenity.

22:32.067 --> 22:35.100
You can't talk about
pussy, dick or asshole,

22:35.100 --> 22:37.067
but I can go to the movies
and watch a man's head

22:37.067 --> 22:38.967
get blown off.
Isn't that obscenity?

22:38.967 --> 22:41.167
Not legally,
but according to

22:41.167 --> 22:43.567
Federal District Judge
Jose Gonzalez,

22:43.567 --> 22:44.833
your material is.

22:44.833 --> 22:46.233
Man, fuck Judge Gonzalez.

22:46.233 --> 22:48.533
I should be able to say
what I damn well please.

22:48.533 --> 22:51.167
That's freedom of speech.
That's what the United
States of America

22:51.167 --> 22:53.433
is supposed to be all about.

22:53.433 --> 22:54.733
You sound very patriotic.

22:54.733 --> 22:58.100
Patriotic?
I am America.

23:09.067 --> 23:11.933
Uh-uh, play that back
from the beginning.

23:18.333 --> 23:22.500
Super producer DJ DeeVee!

23:22.500 --> 23:24.133
Who that?

23:24.133 --> 23:27.167
It's one of
DeeVee friends.

23:27.167 --> 23:28.800
He one of the ones
that got killed

23:28.800 --> 23:31.633
at that
Rex Boogie thing.

23:31.633 --> 23:35.433
Your boy DeeVee, I heard
him on the radio, right?

23:38.467 --> 23:41.500
He got radio connects, you need
to get this tape over there--

23:41.500 --> 23:43.967
Nah, we ain't
doing all that.
Why?

23:43.967 --> 23:46.733
'Cause this music shit
is just for me.

23:46.733 --> 23:49.567
I ain't doing it
so people get to know me.

23:49.567 --> 23:51.867
Oh, that's some bullshit.

23:51.867 --> 23:54.100
You ain't white.
You need to do this shit,

23:54.100 --> 23:56.233
and you need to do it
for one reason only,

23:56.233 --> 23:59.267
so you can get out
of this shit hood.

23:59.267 --> 24:02.167
That ain't never
gonna happen.
Why not?!

24:02.167 --> 24:06.800
Me and Smoke used to always
talk about getting out.

24:06.800 --> 24:10.067
Smoke used to promise.

24:16.267 --> 24:18.367
He...

24:18.367 --> 24:19.800
Hey.

24:19.800 --> 24:21.933
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

24:45.700 --> 24:47.167
I gotta bounce.

24:50.600 --> 24:53.067
Stay as long
as you want.

25:10.800 --> 25:14.467
Ooh, this is my jam!
Ooh, yeah.

25:14.467 --> 25:16.433
Yeah, you like it,
you like how...

25:16.433 --> 25:18.433
Ooh, hey!
Hey...

25:18.433 --> 25:21.300
So, baby, you got what you need
to write something dope?

25:22.833 --> 25:25.200
Yeah, one last question.

25:25.200 --> 25:26.800
What would you say
to your female fans

25:26.800 --> 25:29.100
that listen to you rap about
women in a degrading way?

25:29.100 --> 25:31.467
What would I say?
I wouldn't say shit.

25:31.467 --> 25:34.233
And first of all,
I ain't degrading women.

25:34.233 --> 25:35.767
I ain't talking
all women anyway,

25:35.767 --> 25:37.433
just certain women.

25:37.433 --> 25:39.800
But don't all women
deserve respect?

25:39.800 --> 25:41.933
Not the ones who don't
respect themselves.

25:41.933 --> 25:44.300
So, you mean like prostitutes
don't deserve respect?

25:44.300 --> 25:48.067
I mean prostitutes,
I mean hoes--

25:48.067 --> 25:49.467
Like ones with multiple
sex partners,

25:49.467 --> 25:51.233
or ones whose
baby daddy ran off?

25:51.233 --> 25:52.800
Why are you tripping?

25:52.800 --> 25:55.467
Because I don't know why
the fuck you deserve a cover.

25:55.467 --> 25:57.967
Who the fuck are you
to determine

25:57.967 --> 26:00.133
what woman
deserves your respect?

26:01.600 --> 26:03.467
If you wanted to sit
on my lap,

26:03.467 --> 26:05.300
all you had
to do was ask.

26:09.067 --> 26:10.733
I got everything
that I needed.

26:10.733 --> 26:11.933
Thanks.

26:11.933 --> 26:14.567
Oh, no.
Oh, don't be mad.

26:14.567 --> 26:17.600
Come on, baby, there's--
there's room on this lap now.

26:17.600 --> 26:19.500
Don't-- don't be--
don't be mad.

26:19.500 --> 26:21.700
Fuck you.
Oh, okay.

26:21.700 --> 26:23.200
You'll be back.

26:54.100 --> 26:56.100
Hello.
Dad?

26:56.100 --> 26:57.400
Junior, what's wrong?

26:57.400 --> 27:00.933
Nothing, I'm all right.
I just, uh...

27:00.933 --> 27:02.433
Look, I-- I got a...

27:02.433 --> 27:04.533
Some detective came by
the house today,

27:04.533 --> 27:06.200
showing me pictures
of a dead witness,

27:06.200 --> 27:08.200
and then one of Ahm's boys just
picked me up off the street.

27:08.200 --> 27:09.933
What? Where are you?
I'm on my way!

27:09.933 --> 27:12.267
No, no.
I still have to do my show.

27:12.267 --> 27:13.433
Your show?

27:13.433 --> 27:14.900
Boy, don't nobody care
about your show.

27:14.900 --> 27:17.167
Dad, Ahm's boy is still
outside waiting for me.

27:17.167 --> 27:19.833
Okay? If I leave right now,
he'll know what's up.

27:19.833 --> 27:21.667
Please, just meet me
here after my show.

27:21.667 --> 27:24.533
I finish at 10:00.
Yeah, all right, yeah.

27:24.533 --> 27:26.200
I'll be downstairs
by 9:55.

27:26.200 --> 27:28.233
Thank you.

27:28.233 --> 27:32.067
Thank you, thank you.
All right, bye.

27:35.500 --> 27:38.067
So, you're really gonna
help these guys get bigger?

27:38.067 --> 27:39.833
It's a business.

27:39.833 --> 27:41.967
Yeah, but they perpetuate
the worst stereotypes.

27:41.967 --> 27:45.400
It's just a spectacle.
Spectacle sells.

27:45.400 --> 27:47.500
But you're a woman
who has power, you don't--

27:47.500 --> 27:49.600
Nikki, every label needs
to have a few cash cows.

27:49.600 --> 27:53.100
That's how we keep
the lights on, pay the bills.

27:53.100 --> 27:55.600
But then after that,
you can take a risk?

27:57.267 --> 27:59.633
On?
On a rookie.

27:59.633 --> 28:01.467
Who's really got
something to say

28:01.467 --> 28:04.067
that's both empowering
and uplifting.

28:04.067 --> 28:06.667
The one and only
Mattie Taylor!

28:06.667 --> 28:08.533
When they told me
you were coming yourself,

28:08.533 --> 28:11.667
I made sure to put
my good drawers on.

28:11.667 --> 28:13.267
Luther, looking forward
to the performance.

28:13.267 --> 28:15.067
Yeah, I knew you
was a freak.

28:15.067 --> 28:17.467
Better watch yourself,
you might end up on that stage.

28:17.467 --> 28:19.067
Well...
Y'all want
some drinks?

28:19.067 --> 28:20.467
Hey, yo, Roscoe!

28:20.467 --> 28:22.867
I got this good pussy
over here, man.

28:22.867 --> 28:24.767
And this one,
she swallow every drop.

28:24.767 --> 28:27.600
Yo, that's right.
Let's go.

28:45.067 --> 28:47.200
You think he gonna sing?

28:47.200 --> 28:49.200
I just hope he don't
piss on my seats

28:49.200 --> 28:51.533
before we get
to the station.

28:54.067 --> 28:56.267
Nigga, did you fart?

28:57.700 --> 29:01.700
That was you, nigga.
It wasn't me.

29:17.600 --> 29:20.133
Man.

29:20.133 --> 29:22.333
Woman.

29:22.333 --> 29:24.233
Verse.

29:24.233 --> 29:26.300
Infinity.

29:41.067 --> 29:42.633
95 FM The Ride.

29:42.633 --> 29:45.833
I told Luther
to go fuck himself.

29:45.833 --> 29:47.233
Damita?

29:47.233 --> 29:49.300
Yeah, I did.

29:52.400 --> 29:53.567
I don't believe you.

29:53.567 --> 29:56.367
I did.
I lost my shit.

29:57.900 --> 30:00.267
Well, maybe you got,
uh, I don't know,

30:00.267 --> 30:02.367
something that
you gotta say.

30:02.367 --> 30:04.567
I do, and I will.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.833
What's up?
You blew up my pager.

30:08.833 --> 30:11.867
Yeah, I, uh...
I just, um...

30:13.233 --> 30:14.533
I wanted to tell you, uh...

30:14.533 --> 30:15.933
Are you okay?

30:15.933 --> 30:18.600
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
most def, I...

30:20.000 --> 30:21.700
I-- I just wanted to tell you

30:21.700 --> 30:23.233
that this morning was--

30:23.233 --> 30:25.467
Amazing.

30:25.467 --> 30:27.567
What you doing later?

30:29.600 --> 30:32.833
I don't know, I just...
you know, I gotta go.

30:32.833 --> 30:35.767
I gotta go.

30:35.767 --> 30:37.500
Uh, I'll-- I'll talk
to you in a minute.

30:37.500 --> 30:39.400
Okay.
No, I'm sorry.

30:39.400 --> 30:41.867
I gotta change
the records.

30:41.867 --> 30:43.900
Uh... bye.

31:52.300 --> 31:54.067
Yo, she's dope, right?

31:54.067 --> 31:56.833
Yeah.
Yup.

31:56.833 --> 31:59.067
This girl's
gonna be a star.
Hope so.

31:59.067 --> 32:02.400
I robbed my mom's safe
just so I could film her.

32:46.067 --> 32:49.800
You get her for me,
you'll be my new A&R.

33:35.133 --> 33:37.067
Yeah.

33:37.067 --> 33:38.800
Ladies and gentlemen,

33:38.800 --> 33:40.600
you are listening to
the sounds

33:40.600 --> 33:42.067
of the one,
the only...

33:42.067 --> 33:44.600
Ahm...

33:44.600 --> 33:47.400
...and super producer
DJ DeeVee!

33:47.400 --> 33:49.900
Yeah, rest in peace.

33:49.900 --> 33:51.067
My man David.

33:51.067 --> 33:52.400
Yeah.
Yeah.

33:52.400 --> 33:54.367
Always remember
this moment, baby.

33:54.367 --> 33:56.833
Uh-huh,
hey, yo, Ahm.
Yeah.

33:56.833 --> 33:58.667
Talk to 'em
one time.
Yeah.

33:58.667 --> 34:00.900
Let 'em know...
one time.

34:08.167 --> 34:11.833
Killed that.
Imani X, you loud.

34:11.833 --> 34:13.533
Word, loud.

34:13.533 --> 34:14.767
I'm just a mirror.

34:14.767 --> 34:16.500
That's it.

34:16.500 --> 34:17.900
That was dope!

34:17.900 --> 34:20.767
Thank you.

34:20.767 --> 34:23.633
Imani, please meet
Mattie Taylor.

34:23.633 --> 34:25.633
It's so refreshing
to hear a young artist

34:25.633 --> 34:27.067
who's got something to say.

34:27.067 --> 34:29.800
Someone who defies
stereotypes,

34:29.800 --> 34:32.400
who's empowering
and uplifting.

34:32.400 --> 34:35.067
Damn.
Thank you.

34:35.067 --> 34:37.567
Why don't you stop
by my office?

34:37.567 --> 34:40.067
I'd like to bring
you on board EBJ.

34:40.067 --> 34:43.167
I don't even
know what to say.

34:43.167 --> 34:46.800
Think about it.
But don't think too long.

34:51.967 --> 34:53.367
Bitch,
you a company girl now?

34:53.367 --> 34:55.067
Yo, Mattie has reach.

34:55.067 --> 34:57.400
And from what
you told me about Fouray...

34:57.400 --> 34:58.700
Wait, where is Barry?

34:58.700 --> 34:59.900
Nah, I ain't seen him.

34:59.900 --> 35:01.433
But if EBJ is getting
into rap,

35:01.433 --> 35:03.400
you definitely going
to the top of that pyramid.

35:03.400 --> 35:04.700
See?

35:04.700 --> 35:06.800
Nikki... what you doing?

35:06.800 --> 35:08.167
Yo, what you thought
about tonight?

35:08.167 --> 35:10.067
Oh, check it.
I talked to the guy

35:10.067 --> 35:11.400
about the studio,
we definitely getting you

35:11.400 --> 35:13.200
in the studio tomorrow.
Are you?

35:13.200 --> 35:15.167
Yeah, stay away
from my artists.

35:15.167 --> 35:16.567
This one right here,
you gotta watch this one.

35:16.567 --> 35:17.767
She kinda slippery.

35:17.767 --> 35:19.467
Fuck you, Barry.

35:19.467 --> 35:21.767
I've always had her best
interest at heart-- always.

35:21.767 --> 35:23.267
Oh, her best interest?
How?

35:23.267 --> 35:25.067
Mattie Taylor, who don't
know shit about hip-hop?

35:25.067 --> 35:27.267
I'm what's best
for Imani X.

35:27.267 --> 35:29.200
You wouldn't even listen
to her demo, remember?

35:29.200 --> 35:31.333
Wouldn't let
her audition.

35:31.333 --> 35:34.100
Hold up.
What?

35:38.700 --> 35:40.867
I'm gonna tell
you something...

35:40.867 --> 35:42.333
you better watch yourself.

35:42.333 --> 35:44.567
You keep playing
games with my artists,

35:44.567 --> 35:46.933
I'm gonna play games
with you.

35:46.933 --> 35:49.200
You do that, Barry.

35:56.867 --> 35:59.200
Don't judge me.

35:59.200 --> 36:02.200
So, is that why
you met me today?

36:02.200 --> 36:03.767
Hmm?

36:03.767 --> 36:06.300
This doesn't change
anything I said...

36:06.300 --> 36:07.567
about us.

36:07.567 --> 36:10.567
Except you didn't say
anything about us.

36:18.833 --> 36:20.533
Assassins everywhere.

36:20.533 --> 36:22.833
Yeah, but it was probably more
Mattie than Nikki, though.

36:22.833 --> 36:25.667
Yeah, fuck 'em.
I'm gonna take EBJ down.

36:25.667 --> 36:27.267
Fuck Nikki Jones.

36:27.267 --> 36:29.100
And what's up with that
Ernesto Sierra dude?

36:29.100 --> 36:30.900
Did they close
on anybody yet?

36:30.900 --> 36:33.100
No, I don't think so.
Good.

36:33.100 --> 36:35.267
Tell Tamika I said
set up a meeting.

36:35.267 --> 36:36.900
I'm going after Vanilla Ice.

36:36.900 --> 36:38.867
Please tell me
you're kidding me.

36:38.867 --> 36:40.533
I'm going after
Vanilla Ice.

37:02.067 --> 37:04.900
Run, Junior!

37:04.900 --> 37:06.567
Come on!

37:10.267 --> 37:11.933
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no...

37:11.933 --> 37:13.600
Turn around,
get against the wall.

37:13.600 --> 37:14.900
Turn around.
Me?

37:14.900 --> 37:16.167
Whoa, whoa!

37:16.167 --> 37:17.900
Oh... okay, all right.

37:17.900 --> 37:19.167
Don't make this any harder
than it has to be.

37:19.167 --> 37:20.500
What are you doing?
Let's go.

37:20.500 --> 37:22.333
I didn't do
anything, Dad.

37:22.333 --> 37:24.167
That's my son.
Where are you taking him?!

37:24.167 --> 37:27.067
He's under arrest!
Get out of here!

37:29.433 --> 37:31.400
I'm gonna come
get you, Junior!

37:39.533 --> 37:41.400
He just left.

38:09.067 --> 38:10.967
Somebody's shooting out here!

38:13.467 --> 38:15.333
I see him, I see him!
Yo, get him, he's running!

38:15.333 --> 38:16.900
He's moving, he's moving!

38:16.900 --> 38:20.300
Around the car,
around the car!

38:20.300 --> 38:22.200
He's at the back
of that car!

38:26.467 --> 38:28.100
Fuck.

38:28.100 --> 38:30.200
Get inside,
get inside!

38:42.467 --> 38:44.100
Jesus Christ!

38:47.700 --> 38:50.267
Yo, give it up, Ahm!

39:23.400 --> 39:25.067
Come on.

39:30.633 --> 39:31.967
Next time on "The Breaks"...

39:31.967 --> 39:34.267
This is the biggest night
of my career

39:34.267 --> 39:35.733
and it's game time, baby.

39:35.733 --> 39:37.133
You only have one chance
to break an artist.

39:37.133 --> 39:39.067
You don't need to explain
that to me, Nikki.

39:39.067 --> 39:40.967
Do I gotta keep
looking over my shoulder?

39:40.967 --> 39:42.333
It's New York City, man.

39:42.333 --> 39:43.900
Do you know how many
people spend their entire

39:43.900 --> 39:46.533
miserable lives, wishing for
a chance at greatness?

39:46.533 --> 39:49.900
What's up?
Everybody's talking about
that song you did with DeeVee.

39:49.900 --> 39:51.733
Ain't no protection
nowhere in this game!

39:51.733 --> 39:53.433
Ain't you figure
that out by now?

39:53.433 --> 39:55.067
Darryl Van Putten, Junior,

39:55.067 --> 39:56.867
charged with obstruction
of justice.

39:58.133 --> 39:59.800
Yo...
