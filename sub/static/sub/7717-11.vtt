- Wow, this place is...
So great.

09:48.255 --> 09:50.889
I had no idea--on the phone,
you made it sound kind of dinky.

09:50.891 --> 09:52.824
- Well, I mean, I don't even
have the paycheck yet.

09:52.826 --> 09:54.092
It is a start-up, so...

09:54.094 --> 09:55.794
These things go down
all the time.

09:55.796 --> 09:58.797
- If this company's going down,
I wanna go down on it.

09:58.799 --> 10:00.198
With it.
I wanna go down with it.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.766
- Are you cool
to just hang out?

10:01.768 --> 10:03.034
- Sure, no problem.
- Yeah?

10:03.036 --> 10:04.603
You ready?
- Yeah.

10:04.605 --> 10:07.872
- Let's do it.

10:20.886 --> 10:22.887
- The pen delivery
went amazing,

10:22.889 --> 10:24.956
And now I've got all these pens
just waiting to be unpacked.

10:24.958 --> 10:26.825
But pam did not tell me
to unpack the pens,

10:26.827 --> 10:28.326
And I'm not one of those people
who's just like, "uh, sure,

10:28.328 --> 10:29.995
I'll accept the pens
when they come in,"

10:29.997 --> 10:32.931
I unpack the pens
and get all this credit

10:32.933 --> 10:34.866
And some great pen unpacker.

10:34.868 --> 10:37.068
On the other hand...
They are just sitting here.

10:37.070 --> 10:40.171
Pam didn't tell me
not to unpack them.

10:40.173 --> 10:42.374
Don't wanna be a busybody, but I
don't wanna be a lazybones.

10:42.376 --> 10:44.109
Busybody, lazybones.
Busybody, lazybones.

10:44.111 --> 10:46.678
Aah! My brain is ping-ponging
around in my head right now.

10:46.680 --> 10:47.946
It's insane.

10:47.948 --> 10:50.281
I'm sorry.
What was your question again?

10:50.283 --> 10:52.117
Oh, yeah.

10:52.119 --> 10:54.119
No. I've never had
an espresso before.

10:54.121 --> 10:56.421
They're good, though.

10:56.423 --> 10:58.423
- A-bam!

10:58.425 --> 11:01.159
My favorite
is viennese amaretto.

11:01.161 --> 11:03.261
And the worst flavor
I've tried so far

11:03.263 --> 11:05.697
Is alpine select!

11:05.699 --> 11:06.865
- Yes!

11:06.867 --> 11:08.299
[giggles]

11:08.301 --> 11:09.334
- Ah!
- One!

11:09.336 --> 11:10.935
- Kevin! Kevin! Kevin!
- Two!

11:10.937 --> 11:12.937
- That's enough, kevin.
- Stop it, kevin!

11:12.939 --> 11:13.938
- Four!
- That's enough.

11:13.940 --> 11:15.407
- So for
your menswear catalogue,

11:15.409 --> 11:18.009
I think we can offer you
some very competitive pricing.

11:18.011 --> 11:19.778
- I heard that before.
- Well, I understand, but--

11:19.780 --> 11:21.379
- I bet you have.
He knows nothing

11:21.381 --> 11:23.815
About what people have heard
before, my son.

11:23.817 --> 11:25.950
- Here we go again, another
lecture from the old man.

11:25.952 --> 11:27.952
- Listen to him.
He created you.

11:27.954 --> 11:30.455
- Maybe if you listened
a little bit, you'd improve.

11:30.457 --> 11:32.090
No wonder women
despise you.

11:32.092 --> 11:34.159
- Women
don't despise me.

11:34.161 --> 11:35.827
- His last girlfriend
was a transvestite.

11:35.829 --> 11:36.995
I knew it right away.

11:36.997 --> 11:39.397
Adam's apple
like the prow of a ship.

11:39.399 --> 11:41.433
Thumbs
like a lowland gorilla.

11:41.435 --> 11:44.169
Ha. But this one couldn't see it
or didn't wanna see it.

11:44.171 --> 11:45.937
- All right,
that's enough,

11:45.939 --> 11:47.272
'cause I can say some things
about him too.

11:47.274 --> 11:48.940
- Yeah, like what?
- Like the time

11:48.942 --> 11:51.976
That you got drunk
and--and then...

11:51.978 --> 11:53.411
Killed those kids
on their way to prom.

11:53.413 --> 11:55.313
- That never happened.
He's always been a liar.

11:55.315 --> 11:56.948
Ever since he
was a little kid

11:56.950 --> 11:58.316
And he got caught
"saving treats"

11:58.318 --> 12:00.218
From the kitty litter box.

12:00.220 --> 12:03.788
- So we can offer you matte
or glossy printing--

12:03.790 --> 12:05.724
- Glistening brown morsels

12:05.726 --> 12:08.026
Tumbling from every pouch
in his trousers.

12:08.028 --> 12:10.795
- There's obviously
a volume discount if you--

12:10.797 --> 12:12.864
- Following the cat around
on his knees

12:12.866 --> 12:14.899
With his hands cupped
beneath its tail,

12:14.901 --> 12:17.869
Going, "please, kitty,
may I have some more?"

12:17.871 --> 12:19.771
You can't make
this stuff up!

12:19.773 --> 12:22.006
- No, I think someone
could make it up.

12:22.008 --> 12:23.842
Someone
with very few friends.

12:23.844 --> 12:26.177
- Hey, fellas,
sorry to keep you waiting.

12:26.179 --> 12:27.879
- There he is.
My son.

12:27.881 --> 12:31.983
- [scoffs] got cat turd
collector written all over him.

12:33.252 --> 12:36.321
- Did you say
cat turd collector?

12:36.323 --> 12:38.256
- So definitely looking
to expand our market,

12:38.258 --> 12:40.058
But for now we're just
concentrating on athletes

12:40.060 --> 12:41.826
That are popular
here in the northeast.

12:41.828 --> 12:43.461
Of course,
that's not a mandate.

12:43.463 --> 12:47.866
- "mandate"--always think
of two men on a date.

12:52.772 --> 12:55.406
I have gay friends.
I have one gay friend.

12:55.408 --> 12:57.909
Oscar.
- Mm-hmm.

12:57.911 --> 12:59.844
- All right,
so what makes you think

12:59.846 --> 13:02.413
You'd be
a good fit here?

13:07.019 --> 13:10.288
- Okay.
Um...

13:10.290 --> 13:13.291
All right.

13:13.293 --> 13:15.093
Obviously,
y'all look really busy,

13:15.095 --> 13:16.961
And I don't want to waste
your time anymore.

13:16.963 --> 13:20.064
Sorry, I just, uh...

13:20.066 --> 13:22.867
Obviously, I'm not qualified
to be here, man, I'm...

13:22.869 --> 13:25.403
I'm a warehouse manager,
you know...

13:25.405 --> 13:28.439
- Darryl,
I was a newspaper editor.

13:28.441 --> 13:31.009
- Science teacher.
Volleyball coach.

13:31.011 --> 13:33.111
- I work
at a home shopping network.

13:33.113 --> 13:34.445
- I'm a lawyer.

13:34.447 --> 13:36.581
I'm the only one here
who can honestly help.

13:36.583 --> 13:39.584
- And as you know,
I was a paper salesman.

13:39.586 --> 13:42.854
Hey, I find it helps if you just
picture everybody naked.

13:42.856 --> 13:45.089
[laughter]

13:45.091 --> 13:47.058
- Cool.

13:47.060 --> 13:50.228
Hey, thanks.

13:50.230 --> 13:52.931
- So how
about we start over, hmm?

13:52.933 --> 13:55.099
Darryl, do you have
any thoughts on the company?

13:55.101 --> 13:58.303
- Yes, as a matter of fact,
I, uh...

13:58.305 --> 14:00.839
I wrote some down.
- Oh.

14:00.841 --> 14:04.976
- There you go.

14:04.978 --> 14:07.846
Wow, this guy came prepared.
It impresses me!

14:07.848 --> 14:09.514
[laughter]

14:11.584 --> 14:15.119
- Ah. So this is what 2:00 p.M.
Looks like around here.

14:18.557 --> 14:22.126
I usually take a siesta
about now.

14:25.331 --> 14:27.599
- Stocking pens, huh?

14:27.601 --> 14:29.267
You're like
the new office administrator.

14:29.269 --> 14:31.169
- No. I just took over
the pen shipment

14:31.171 --> 14:32.570
Because pam had to leave.

14:32.572 --> 14:34.505
When I say it out loud,
I know that sounds insane,

14:34.507 --> 14:35.874
But it's the truth,
I swear.

14:35.876 --> 14:38.443
- Pam!
Pam, look out!

14:38.445 --> 14:40.912
Erin's gunning for your job!
- No, I'm not.

14:40.914 --> 14:42.981
- [imitating gunfire]
- it's not like that at all.

14:42.983 --> 14:45.350
Forget it. I'm so sorry.
- Pam, look out!

14:45.352 --> 14:47.518
- Pens, you did not
buy into this.

14:47.520 --> 14:50.955
I am sorry.
What a day you've had.

14:52.558 --> 14:54.893
- By the way, jim talks
about you all the time.

14:54.895 --> 14:56.995
- That's sweet
that he talks about me.

14:56.997 --> 14:58.062
- It's too bad he still has
to work part-time

14:58.064 --> 14:59.063
In scranton though.

14:59.065 --> 15:00.665
- Well, that's funny,

15:00.667 --> 15:04.035
'cause I think of him as working
part-time in philadelphia.

15:04.037 --> 15:08.473
- We can't wait
until you move here.

15:08.475 --> 15:11.276
- I'm sorry--you guys are here
to sell us paper?

15:11.278 --> 15:13.011
- Do you mind?
The men are talking.

15:13.013 --> 15:15.046
- Sons used to idolize
their fathers.

15:15.048 --> 15:16.681
- Us old-timers
need to stick together.

15:16.683 --> 15:20.151
And how better
than by signing a contract?

15:20.153 --> 15:21.452
- I'd love to.

15:21.454 --> 15:24.088
Sam junior here,
he runs the business now.

15:24.090 --> 15:25.990
Kinda pushed me out,
truth be told.

15:25.992 --> 15:28.626
I'm just here
for human contact.

15:28.628 --> 15:30.995
- Okay, pop.

15:30.997 --> 15:33.398
- Wait.
So you're the boss?

15:33.400 --> 15:34.999
- That's right.

15:35.001 --> 15:38.002
- Hi. I'm clark.
- Hey.

15:38.004 --> 15:39.470
- Let's talk.
- Okay.

15:39.472 --> 15:41.973
- So if you look
at our catalog here...

15:41.975 --> 15:44.175
- Well,
thanks for coming down, darryl.

15:44.177 --> 15:45.576
- It was nice meeting you,
darryl.

15:45.578 --> 15:46.978
I think
you'd fit in great here.

15:46.980 --> 15:48.579
- Yeah.
Yeah, me too.

15:48.581 --> 15:49.714
I think it'd be like...
[laughs]

15:49.716 --> 15:51.416
You know what?

15:51.418 --> 15:54.485
I think it'd be like
a kevin durant jump shot--

15:54.487 --> 15:58.156
<i>Perfecto!</i>

16:10.703 --> 16:12.170
Oh, my god.

16:14.273 --> 16:15.540
- They're the ones

16:15.542 --> 16:17.408
Who put a fish tank
next to a basketball hoop.

16:17.410 --> 16:18.710
It's like if I put
a glass of milk

16:18.712 --> 16:20.979
On the edge of the table
and cece knocks it over,

16:20.981 --> 16:22.447
I don't blame cece.

16:22.449 --> 16:25.416
- So I'm like a three-year-old
girl in this scenario.

16:25.418 --> 16:27.418
- Say they
don't hire you.

16:27.420 --> 16:29.420
It's not like
you're out on the street.

16:29.422 --> 16:31.456
You have a great job
with people who love you.

16:31.458 --> 16:34.158
- And I'd only get to see jada
on the weekends.

16:34.160 --> 16:36.094
You know, I'm...
I'm not so sure

16:36.096 --> 16:38.596
I'd like living
in philadelphia.

16:38.598 --> 16:41.432
- Right? Thank you!
It's just philly.

16:41.434 --> 16:44.135
Everyone's acting like it's
new york or paris or london.

16:44.137 --> 16:46.304
- Who needs it?
- Not us.

16:46.306 --> 16:48.339
[footsteps]

16:48.341 --> 16:51.209
- Okay.
So the consensus was

16:51.211 --> 16:53.077
That that was unique.

16:53.079 --> 16:55.046
They're gonna make you pay
for the fish,

16:55.048 --> 16:56.347
And...

16:56.349 --> 16:59.384
They wanted to know
when you can start.

16:59.386 --> 17:01.386
- What?

17:01.388 --> 17:03.454
How 'bout yesterday?

17:03.456 --> 17:05.523
[both laughing]

17:05.525 --> 17:08.059
- Congratulations.
- Oh, thank you.

17:08.061 --> 17:10.294
- I guess you gotta move
to philly after all.

17:10.296 --> 17:11.529
- Yes, I love philly!

17:11.531 --> 17:13.364
Two-one-five or die!

17:13.366 --> 17:15.400
[laughing]

17:15.402 --> 17:16.667
- No, I'm not upset.

17:16.669 --> 17:19.771
I'm really excited
for darryl.

17:21.373 --> 17:22.774
Maybe I'm
a little disappointed

17:22.776 --> 17:26.244
That we'll be losing him.

17:28.213 --> 17:30.448
- It feels really hot in here.
Is it hot in here?

17:30.450 --> 17:32.050
It feels really,
really hot in here.

17:32.052 --> 17:34.285
- It's insane! They need
to have the a.C. On year-round!

17:34.287 --> 17:35.653
January too!

17:35.655 --> 17:37.255
[thudding]

17:37.257 --> 17:40.658
- I don't get the point
of this stupid window!

17:42.127 --> 17:43.594
- I mean, look,
you and I both know

17:43.596 --> 17:46.431
That in paper or fashion,
styles change.

17:46.433 --> 17:48.399
Check out
my dad's suit.

17:48.401 --> 17:50.501
You are looking
at pure acrylic.

17:50.503 --> 17:52.437
That's why his face
always breaks out.

17:52.439 --> 17:55.306
- Does that suit
come with a fire extinguisher?

17:55.308 --> 17:56.774
- [chuckling]
- ha ha ha.

17:56.776 --> 17:58.076
- You know what, dad?

17:58.078 --> 17:59.744
Maybe you should
buy me a suit.

17:59.746 --> 18:01.579
I mean,
I'm gonna need one, right,

18:01.581 --> 18:03.381
If I'm ever gonna
get a "real" job

18:03.383 --> 18:06.417
And move "my lazy ass"
out of your "g.D. House."

18:06.419 --> 18:09.087
- He's got ya there.

18:09.089 --> 18:11.122
That's italian silk.
Very comfortable.

18:11.124 --> 18:13.558
Very tasteful...
Although expensive.

18:13.560 --> 18:16.227
- Yeah, you don't want italian.
You'll look like a mafia don.

18:16.229 --> 18:18.729
Next thing you know, you'll be
doing life in rikers island.

18:18.731 --> 18:21.199
- Well, that's better than
looking like the undertaker

18:21.201 --> 18:23.568
From boring island.
- That place doesn't exist.

18:23.570 --> 18:25.536
It's not a documented island.

18:25.538 --> 18:28.639
Cartograph much?

18:30.275 --> 18:31.776
- [whistles]

18:31.778 --> 18:34.245
- How do I look?

18:34.247 --> 18:37.315
- Actually...
You look great.

18:37.317 --> 18:38.549
They steered you right.

18:38.551 --> 18:39.884
I guess it does make sense

18:39.886 --> 18:42.320
Buying
from a father-son team.

18:42.322 --> 18:43.454
You know what?

18:43.456 --> 18:45.623
I'll take one too.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.558
- Everyone, now that we have
all this energy,

18:47.560 --> 18:49.393
Why don't we move the copier
into the annex

18:49.395 --> 18:50.661
Like we've always
wanted to?

18:50.663 --> 18:52.897
- Whoo!
- Frickin' a!

18:52.899 --> 18:54.632
- So long, noise!

18:54.634 --> 18:56.434
- One, two, three!

18:56.436 --> 18:57.902
[rip]
- oh!

18:57.904 --> 18:59.370
- And we have torn up
the carpet.

18:59.372 --> 19:01.606
Oh, we're gonna be
in so much trouble!

19:01.608 --> 19:03.474
- Wait!

19:03.476 --> 19:05.443
It's beautiful.

19:05.445 --> 19:06.744
Hardwood.

19:06.746 --> 19:08.646
I always knew
it was down here.

19:08.648 --> 19:11.549
I just never dreamed
that I would actually see it.

19:11.551 --> 19:13.284
- Tear up the carpet!

19:13.286 --> 19:14.485
- Whoo!

19:14.487 --> 19:17.522
- Kill their fish,
and they still hire me.

19:17.524 --> 19:18.923
That's how you do that,
baby.

19:18.925 --> 19:20.224
[sighs]

19:20.226 --> 19:21.826
It's all good.
I'm ready.

19:21.828 --> 19:23.895
Y'all ready for this?

19:23.897 --> 19:25.863

19:39.212 --> 19:40.945
- Kevin, move.
I can't pull up the rug

19:40.947 --> 19:43.581
If you're standing on it
with your rhinoceros feet.

19:43.583 --> 19:44.882
- Well,
I can't stand here

19:44.884 --> 19:47.385
If you pull the carpet out
from under me.

19:47.387 --> 19:49.620
- Oh, my head
is killing me.

19:49.622 --> 19:51.556
Does anyone have
a baby aspirin?

19:51.558 --> 19:53.224
- Oh,
enough with the whining already.

19:53.226 --> 19:54.492
Why don't you just have
some more coffee?

19:54.494 --> 19:57.495
I didn't get a chance
to try them all

19:57.497 --> 20:00.431
Because creed poured
my bogota sunrise in the plant.

20:00.433 --> 20:01.566
- I saw the leaves twitch.

20:01.568 --> 20:03.734
- Shut up.
- You shut up!

20:03.736 --> 20:05.670
- Everybody shut up
and work.

20:05.672 --> 20:07.371
- We don't work for you.
- Yeah.

20:07.373 --> 20:08.472
- Yeah.
- Hey.

20:08.474 --> 20:10.675
It's 5:00.

[horns honking]

20:14.314 --> 20:17.682
- Kevin, can--

20:17.684 --> 20:22.553
[horns honking]

20:22.555 --> 20:24.522
- Yes!
We did it!

20:24.524 --> 20:25.856
- You opened the door.

20:25.858 --> 20:30.261
- And you closed it.
The boys are back in town.

20:30.263 --> 20:32.363
High fives!
Ha ha!

20:32.365 --> 20:36.734
- Hey, so all that really
specific cat turd business--

20:36.736 --> 20:38.336
That was about you, right?

20:38.338 --> 20:41.305
- You got me!

20:41.307 --> 20:43.741
I used to collect 'em.
- Why?

20:43.743 --> 20:46.944
- Each one is very different,
like a snowflake.

21:03.695 --> 21:05.863
- Hey.
What happened here?

21:05.865 --> 21:07.798
- You left me in charge
of the pens, pam.

21:07.800 --> 21:11.435
That's what happened.
The pens happened.

21:15.307 --> 21:17.808
- Are the pens here?
