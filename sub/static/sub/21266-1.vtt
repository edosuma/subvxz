<i>You don't have to be
quiet, but just shut the fuck up.</i>

00:06.093 --> 00:07.726
<i>Are we good?</i>

00:07.762 --> 00:08.861
<i>Let's cut to the fucking chase, man.</i>

00:08.896 --> 00:10.763
- Let's cut to the chase.
<i>- Boom.</i>

00:10.798 --> 00:13.866
<i>Does my hair look particularly terrible?</i>

00:13.901 --> 00:16.901
I do ask for the right
to be able to spit.

00:16.936 --> 00:19.871
So you got, like, 45?

00:19.906 --> 00:21.372
Sure.

00:21.408 --> 00:23.841
- I love food and wine.
<i>- Dre, take two.</i>

00:23.877 --> 00:26.778
Take two? What do you mean, "take two"?

00:26.813 --> 00:28.513
February, Stevie Nicks.

00:28.548 --> 00:30.314
This is a whole, like, art to this.

00:30.349 --> 00:32.283
You want me to scoot this way?
Is that better for the light?

00:32.317 --> 00:34.818
I'll put this in the movie. I'll put
all this shit in the movie.

00:34.853 --> 00:36.620
That's why I'm trying to tell 'em to go.

00:36.655 --> 00:37.888
Oh, jeez.

00:37.924 --> 00:40.291
- When is this coming out?
- Huh? Say again?

00:40.326 --> 00:41.425
When this gonna be out?

00:41.460 --> 00:43.360
It should be out next year.

00:43.396 --> 00:47.298
Describe that relationship,
Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine.

00:47.333 --> 00:50.300
Okay, cool. We're talking
about Jimmy and Dr. Dre.

00:50.335 --> 00:52.436
The relationship between Jimmy and Dre.

00:52.471 --> 00:55.204
April 1st, 2014,

00:55.240 --> 00:59.476
a rumor leaks
that Apple is buying Beats.

01:01.346 --> 01:03.814
So, I call Jimmy like,
"Yo, is this for real?"

01:03.849 --> 01:06.182
"No, Will, those are rumors.

01:06.217 --> 01:07.850
It's not real."

01:09.187 --> 01:10.219
Right?

01:11.122 --> 01:13.189
April Fool's!

01:13.224 --> 01:14.857
Excuse me. Excuse me.

01:14.892 --> 01:17.193
What's the matter? Take it off.

01:17.228 --> 01:19.162
<i>I called Dre. I said, "Dre,</i>

01:19.197 --> 01:23.599
"remember De Niro's character,
Jimmy, in <i> Goodfellas</i>

01:23.634 --> 01:26.535
"when Jimmy told the guys,

01:26.571 --> 01:27.870
<i>"'Don't buy any furs.</i>

01:27.905 --> 01:30.138
<i>Don't buy cars. Don't get showy'?"</i>

01:30.174 --> 01:31.841
<i>He said, "Yeah?"</i>

01:31.876 --> 01:34.844
<i>I said, "Don't move this weekend.</i>

01:34.879 --> 01:36.979
Don't do anything."

01:37.014 --> 01:39.948
He says, "I gotcha."

01:39.984 --> 01:44.353
That Friday night... Puff calls me.

01:44.388 --> 01:47.722
"Yo, man, is this true
or not, this deal?

01:47.757 --> 01:51.159
You made a deal with Apple,
and you're not telling me?"

01:51.195 --> 01:54.829
I said, "Look, I'm talking to a
bunch of people about the company.

01:54.865 --> 01:57.966
<i>You gotta respect me, know that
I can't talk to you about it."</i>

01:58.001 --> 02:00.434
Now that was about eight o'clock.

02:01.838 --> 02:03.972
Two in the morning,

02:04.007 --> 02:07.976
Puff calls me and starts
yelling over the phone.

02:08.011 --> 02:11.479
"You wouldn't tell me?
You wouldn't tell your friend?

02:11.515 --> 02:17.051
And yet Dr. Dre and Tyrese are
talking about it on Facebook."

02:17.086 --> 02:19.320
I said, "Where?"

02:19.355 --> 02:23.424
He said, "Facebook!"
I said, "I... I gotta go."

02:23.459 --> 02:25.692
The homey is drunk off a Heinekens.

02:28.697 --> 02:30.163
The homey drunk off a Hein...

02:30.198 --> 02:32.332
I look, he said, "Stop
searching, motherfucker!"

02:32.367 --> 02:35.402
We had gone for, like,
six weeks without it leaking.

02:35.437 --> 02:37.571
Billionaire boys' club, for real, homey.

02:37.606 --> 02:39.472
- Huh? Fix your face.
- Yeah, you know that.

02:39.508 --> 02:40.741
- Fix your face.
- You know that.

02:40.776 --> 02:44.044
This thing is leaked.
This thing is loud.

02:44.079 --> 02:47.280
Oh, shit, the <i> Forbes's</i> list
just changed.

02:47.315 --> 02:49.849
They need... Hey, it came out,
like, two weeks ago.

02:49.884 --> 02:53.553
They need to update the <i> Forbes's</i> list.
Shit just changed.

02:53.588 --> 02:54.954
In a big way.

02:54.989 --> 02:56.489
- Oh my.
- Understand that.

02:56.525 --> 02:59.192
- Oh my.
- The first billionaire in hip-hop,

02:59.227 --> 03:02.127
right here from the motherfucking
West Coast, believe me.

03:02.163 --> 03:04.196
Oh! Oh shit, nigga.

03:07.068 --> 03:10.036
Fuck y'all, niggas. What the
fuck y'all niggas talking about?

03:10.071 --> 03:12.438
Nigga, what?
What y'all niggas talking about?

03:15.309 --> 03:16.709
Tyrese fucked that up.

03:16.744 --> 03:18.677
This nigga was so drunk and high,

03:18.712 --> 03:21.080
I don't know what the fuck he
was, but he went, "Yeah, nigga,

03:21.115 --> 03:23.682
"the first motherfucking deal
you nailed, nigga.

03:23.717 --> 03:26.118
From Compton, nigga. Yeah, nigga."

03:26.153 --> 03:27.953
And then Tyrese crip walks.

03:27.988 --> 03:32.591
And I'm... I can only imagine
Jimmy at that point in time.

03:32.626 --> 03:34.059
"No, this can't be!

03:34.095 --> 03:36.094
"This... No! This can't...

03:36.129 --> 03:37.395
What, are you crazy?"

03:37.430 --> 03:38.630
Crazy. It was like,

03:38.665 --> 03:39.598
"What is this?

03:39.633 --> 03:42.100
How can this possibly be the case?"

03:42.135 --> 03:43.835
We start off this Friday morning

03:43.870 --> 03:45.369
with some California love.

03:45.405 --> 03:48.607
<i>Hip-hop mogul
and headphone tycoon, Dr. Dre,</i>

03:48.642 --> 03:51.709
<i>boasting in a video on Facebook
with friend Tyrese Gibson.</i>

03:51.744 --> 03:53.111
The biggest deal in its history,

03:53.146 --> 03:55.415
<i>and hip-hop's first billionaire.</i>

03:55.470 --> 03:59.673
<i>The selling price, rumored
to be a whopping... $3.2 billion.</i>

03:59.674 --> 04:02.242
Think about it. Apple known
for discretion in its deals,

04:02.277 --> 04:04.777
and... and then,
you know, there's, like,

04:04.813 --> 04:08.280
a Facebook page with a
victory lap by Dr. Dre.

04:08.316 --> 04:10.617
<i>I can't imagine what
the legal departments were doing</i>

04:10.652 --> 04:11.923
when they saw that video.

04:11.947 --> 04:13.487
This I just a bad deal.

04:13.488 --> 04:15.588
"Yes, hello? This is Apple.

04:15.624 --> 04:17.490
"Oh, you niggas want to talk early, huh?

04:17.526 --> 04:20.392
Take a few... yeah, take a couple off."

04:20.428 --> 04:21.694
"Yeah, take a couple off, nigga.

04:21.730 --> 04:24.230
Shut up, nigga. It ain't inked yet."

04:25.199 --> 04:27.199
I had been wanting to work with Apple...

04:27.235 --> 04:32.938
at that point, it's probably... 10
years, maybe more than 10 years.

04:32.973 --> 04:36.708
And I'm like, "How could
this be possibly happening?"

04:36.744 --> 04:38.610
So, sure, I thought the deal could blow.

04:38.646 --> 04:40.846
I think, you know, for Jimmy, who
had to bear the brunt of it...

04:40.881 --> 04:42.981
I'm sure it was not a good
two or three days.

04:43.017 --> 04:45.483
And I felt bad for him,
'cause he was getting...

04:45.519 --> 04:47.185
he was getting the crap
knocked out of him,

04:47.220 --> 04:49.254
and he was responsible
to all the shareholders

04:49.289 --> 04:51.156
to make that deal go through.

04:51.191 --> 04:52.591
He was crushed.

04:53.527 --> 04:54.392
And when he told me...

04:54.428 --> 04:56.261
when I finally talked
to him, he was like...

04:57.297 --> 04:59.630
"We could potentially lose this."

05:01.134 --> 05:04.102
You know? And he says...

05:05.772 --> 05:07.838
"But it's the horse I rode in with."

05:09.809 --> 05:11.576
<i>I was actually in the studio,</i>

05:11.611 --> 05:12.877
<i>excitement was in the room.</i>

05:12.912 --> 05:16.346
<i>You mix excitement with a
fucking fifth of alcohol, man,</i>

05:16.382 --> 05:18.950
<i>something terrible is bound to happen.</i>

05:18.985 --> 05:20.551

05:31.964 --> 05:34.131
Sometimes things like this happen.

05:37.002 --> 05:40.504
And I'm so secluded, I'm so private.

05:40.539 --> 05:43.773
At the same time, I want
to have fun, I want to party,

05:43.809 --> 05:46.143
and I want to make my music
and that whole shit.

05:46.178 --> 05:48.277
But it, you know...

05:48.313 --> 05:52.849
As far as, um... along with
cameras around me, like this...

05:55.186 --> 05:57.487
along with cameras in my studio,

05:57.522 --> 06:00.389
around my family, in my home...

06:01.693 --> 06:04.327
around any fucking thing that I'm doing

06:04.362 --> 06:05.894
that I really give a fuck about.

06:08.966 --> 06:10.666
<i>Well, I'm at a place with it right now</i>

06:10.701 --> 06:14.504
<i>where I'm comfortable enough
to let these things go</i>

06:14.539 --> 06:16.372
<i>and to talk about these things.</i>

06:20.945 --> 06:24.680
Okay, God, give us a lightning
strike, but keep it out there.

07:47.795 --> 07:52.265
You're about to hear what many people

07:52.300 --> 07:53.933
<i>that are offensive.</i>

07:53.968 --> 07:55.635

09:14.646 --> 09:18.782
<i>I've had such a traumatic career,</i>

<i>but such a fortunate career

<i>It seems like these artists
that I've worked with</i>

09:25.890 --> 09:28.525
<i>are fucking angels to me, you know?</i>

09:28.560 --> 09:31.194
<i>They always come in at the right time.</i>

09:32.731 --> 09:34.030
<i>As far as me and Jimmy goes,</i>

09:34.065 --> 09:37.400
<i>we're just some lucky motherfuckers, man.</i>

09:37.436 --> 09:40.069
Here's Dr. Dre. Hello, Dr. Dre.

09:40.104 --> 09:42.104
First of all,
what is he making right now?

09:42.140 --> 09:43.439
I'm not interviewing fucking Dre.

09:43.474 --> 09:45.674
I know you're not interviewing him.

09:45.710 --> 09:48.277
<i>I always felt that I had
to work harder than the next guy</i>

09:48.313 --> 09:50.346
<i>just to do as well as the next guy.</i>

09:50.381 --> 09:54.283
<i>And to do better than the
next guy, I had to just kill.</i>

09:54.319 --> 09:56.685
<i>Jimmy Iovine, the music executive,</i>

09:56.721 --> 10:00.356
<i>has worked with everyone from
Bruce Springsteen to Lady Gaga,</i>

10:00.391 --> 10:02.190
<i>but his partnership with Dr. Dre</i>

10:02.226 --> 10:05.126
<i>is creating the most
business buzz these days.</i>

10:05.162 --> 10:06.662
<i>What kind of numbers can you give us</i>

10:06.697 --> 10:08.230
on how quickly this business has grown?

10:08.265 --> 10:11.166
And has it grown faster
than you thought it would?

10:11.201 --> 10:13.701
Well, of course it's grown
faster than we thought it would.

10:19.076 --> 10:21.642
<i>So what happened was, Apple stays true</i>

10:21.678 --> 10:24.579
<i>to who I always knew
they were, kept their word,</i>

10:24.614 --> 10:28.082
<i>ignored all the noise,
and made the deal.</i>

10:30.787 --> 10:32.720
<i>There is this thing
called the American dream,</i>

10:32.756 --> 10:34.955
<i>and we know it's a myth.</i>

10:34.991 --> 10:38.793
<i>It only applies to very few people.</i>

10:38.828 --> 10:41.028
<i>But Jimmy's one of those people</i>

10:41.063 --> 10:44.064
who has not only succeeded,

10:44.100 --> 10:47.902
<i>but has become a better
person in the process.</i>

10:48.737 --> 10:50.237
<i>He's a scrapper, man.</i>

10:50.273 --> 10:52.672
I mean, he came from Hell's Kitchen.

10:52.708 --> 10:56.076
He's persistent.
This motherfucker is, like...

10:56.112 --> 10:57.945
He's a different type of motherfucker.

10:57.980 --> 11:01.448
Jimmy has this brute law state.

11:01.483 --> 11:02.749
It can appear rude.

11:02.785 --> 11:04.785
<i>Lots of people don't like him,</i>

11:04.820 --> 11:07.987
<i>but brutal honesty is why
you want him in the room.</i>

11:08.023 --> 11:10.557
Of course, it's all driven
by his low self-esteem.

11:10.592 --> 11:12.191
I mean, but so are we all, you know?

11:12.227 --> 11:14.828
<i>And our visions of grandiosity,</i>

11:14.863 --> 11:16.095
<i>you know, on top of that.</i>

11:16.131 --> 11:18.197
What else is there?

11:18.233 --> 11:21.000
<i>Jimmy's the guy
firing a million ideas a minute,</i>

11:21.036 --> 11:23.403
<i>and Dre is looking at those ideas,</i>

11:26.274 --> 11:28.441
<i>that is the best in the world.</i>

11:28.476 --> 11:30.443

my favorite rock group of all time.

12:31.371 --> 12:33.371
Here's a...

12:33.406 --> 12:37.241
a little bit of Kraftwerk,
"Metal on Metal," live.

12:39.879 --> 12:41.344
<i>I was born in Compton,</i>

12:41.380 --> 12:43.847
<i>two weeks after my
mother's 16th birthday.</i>

12:43.883 --> 12:46.449
<i>A lot of shit went on with my father.</i>

12:46.485 --> 12:49.653
<i>He's smart as shit,
but crazy as shit, too.</i>

12:49.688 --> 12:53.524
Very abusive,
physically and, uh, verbally.

12:53.559 --> 12:55.025
<i>A lot of drugs.</i>

12:55.794 --> 12:57.693
<i>And he was out of the picture</i>

12:57.729 --> 12:59.829
<i>before I could talk, you know?</i>

12:59.864 --> 13:01.898
<i>But the violence that was going on,</i>

13:01.933 --> 13:03.233
<i>it was just normal.</i>

13:05.404 --> 13:08.471
<i>Unit 13-80-61, 13-80-61, drive-by shooting,</i>

13:08.507 --> 13:10.873
<i>confirm one victim down.
53-18 South Main.</i>

13:10.909 --> 13:13.042
<i>Here you go. I knew it was gonna happen,</i>

13:13.077 --> 13:14.010
<i>'cause this is a Saturday night,</i>

13:14.045 --> 13:15.945
<i>it's terribly warm, the moon's out,</i>

13:15.980 --> 13:17.747
<i>and the gangs are already
starting to shoot.</i>

13:17.782 --> 13:20.482
<i>Compton, especially
where and when I grew up,</i>

13:20.518 --> 13:21.784
<i>it was going down.</i>

13:21.819 --> 13:24.253
<i>More than 70,000 gang members</i>

13:24.288 --> 13:25.922
<i>live in Los Angeles County.</i>

13:25.957 --> 13:27.924
<i>Violence can erupt any time.</i>

13:27.959 --> 13:31.427
<i>Because my mother was
having a kid at such a young age,</i>

13:31.462 --> 13:34.530
<i>people were telling her,
her life isn't gonna be shit.</i>

13:34.565 --> 13:36.231
<i>Her son's life isn't gonna be shit.</i>

13:36.267 --> 13:39.000
<i>So I can remember my entire youth,</i>

13:39.036 --> 13:40.302
<i>my mom banging in my head</i>

13:40.337 --> 13:42.404
<i>that I had to be a success at something.</i>

13:42.440 --> 13:44.306
<i>I used it as a tool.</i>

13:44.341 --> 13:48.276
It made me strive to do better.

13:48.311 --> 13:50.445
<i>She's one of the
strongest people I know.</i>

13:50.480 --> 13:52.747
<i>Compton was the American dream.</i>

13:52.783 --> 13:55.016
<i>Sunny California. Temptingly close</i>

13:55.052 --> 13:57.586
<i>to the Los Angeles ghetto
in the '50s and '60s,</i>

13:57.621 --> 14:00.055
<i>it became the black American dream.</i>

14:00.090 --> 14:02.423
<i>But the dream has turned sour.</i>

14:02.459 --> 14:04.692
<i>They have been unable
to solve the problems</i>

14:04.727 --> 14:06.026
<i>of crime and growing welfare,</i>

14:06.062 --> 14:08.596
<i>which is slowly turning suburban Compton</i>

14:08.631 --> 14:11.132
<i>into an extension
of the black inner city.</i>

14:11.167 --> 14:14.902
Bill Kurtis, CBS News,
Compton, California.

14:17.840 --> 14:20.074
Yeah, I mean, if you know
anything about hip-hop

14:20.109 --> 14:23.176
or the history of hip-hop,
you know that melody.

14:23.212 --> 14:24.912
It's like late '70s, early '80s,

14:24.947 --> 14:27.147
Kraftwerk was a big inspiration

14:27.182 --> 14:29.483
for a lot of hip-hop artists
back then, you know?

14:29.518 --> 14:32.753
When hip-hop was really
starting from the ground floor.

14:32.788 --> 14:36.156
So, you know, they're definitely
one of my inspirations.

14:37.392 --> 14:40.260
<i>I think it was born in him,</i>

14:40.295 --> 14:42.596
<i>the music.</i>

14:42.631 --> 14:45.965
<i>He liked noise.</i>

14:46.001 --> 14:49.202
<i>He's always been like that.</i>

14:49.238 --> 14:53.272
<i>When he was a baby, you just put
him somewhere near a speaker,</i>

14:53.307 --> 14:56.308
and he'd just lay there
and kind of looked in the air

14:56.344 --> 14:58.511
like he's searching for the notes,

14:58.546 --> 14:59.946
the sounds, and stuff.

14:59.981 --> 15:01.981
- Hey, what's happening?
- Hey, Tommy.

15:03.852 --> 15:06.753
We always had the house that
everybody would congregate.

15:06.788 --> 15:09.455
<i>There was always parties and dancing.</i>

15:09.490 --> 15:11.290
<i>When company would come over,</i>

15:11.325 --> 15:13.292
<i>Andre would be the little DJ.</i>

15:13.327 --> 15:15.227
<i>Before I could read, if there was a song</i>

15:15.263 --> 15:16.195
<i>that I knew everybody liked,</i>

15:16.230 --> 15:17.929
<i>I just knew what that label looked like,</i>

15:17.965 --> 15:19.965
<i>so I would stack up 1045s</i>

15:20.000 --> 15:22.234
<i>in the order that I saw fit.</i>

15:22.270 --> 15:24.370
<i>He'd just stack 'em up and play them.</i>

15:40.888 --> 15:42.387
<i>abuse and all that stuff.</i>

15:42.422 --> 15:44.088
<i>I saw my share of violence.</i>

15:44.123 --> 15:47.024
<i>My mom tried to keep me away
from that as much as possible,</i>

15:47.060 --> 15:49.661
so I was to myself quite a bit.

15:49.696 --> 15:53.764
<i>And my brother Tyree

15:56.403 --> 15:58.468

But I don't want to get into that.

16:05.812 --> 16:08.545

16:45.617 --> 16:48.083

16:52.690 --> 16:54.823
Yeah, I gotta spend

<i>Jimmy Iovine, my little brother.</i>

17:59.622 --> 18:01.789
<i>We used to call him
"the guy who fell to Earth,"</i>

18:01.824 --> 18:04.257
because he was so unlike anyone else.

18:04.293 --> 18:08.195
<i>I was born in Red Hook,
Brooklyn, in 1953.</i>

18:08.230 --> 18:09.963
<i>My grandparents came from Italy.</i>

18:09.998 --> 18:12.665
<i>And my mother's father,
he was a longshoreman.</i>

18:12.701 --> 18:16.402
<i>My dad went to work down at the
piers as well as a longshoreman.</i>

18:16.438 --> 18:19.772
There wasn't a lot of talk about
being a doctor or a lawyer,

18:19.808 --> 18:21.741
<i>but I was a very
fortunate guy, you know?</i>

18:21.776 --> 18:23.810
<i>I had a mother and father
that loved me a lot,</i>

18:23.846 --> 18:27.079
<i>and my sister, and my grandmother,
and my aunts, and my uncles.</i>

18:27.114 --> 18:29.281
<i>I don't know how old
he was when he started walking.</i>

18:29.317 --> 18:33.553
He never had to, because my mother
and I would do everything for him.

18:33.588 --> 18:37.390
<i>And then, of course, we were so
worried when he started school.</i>

18:39.728 --> 18:44.163
I don't remember one moment
of high school that I enjoyed.

18:44.198 --> 18:47.466
<i>Catholic school, nuns, suits,</i>

18:47.501 --> 18:50.602
jacket, tie, no girls, all guys.

18:50.637 --> 18:53.272
I hated every second of it.

18:53.307 --> 18:54.740
I would make his tie every morning.

18:54.775 --> 18:57.509
I hated it. I used to have
a lot of trouble reading.

18:57.544 --> 18:58.810
And I would do his homework.

18:58.846 --> 19:00.245
I was below average.

19:00.280 --> 19:03.081
<i>I wanted to get out of school.</i>

19:05.085 --> 19:06.785
<i>So, I bought a guitar,</i>

19:06.820 --> 19:08.953
<i>14 to 16 was my band.</i>

19:08.989 --> 19:11.590
And we would all go to these
dinky, little dark places.

19:11.625 --> 19:14.025
Couple of really nice clubs
in New York City.

19:14.060 --> 19:16.227
<i>You should never put the
lights on in places like this.</i>

19:16.263 --> 19:17.495
<i>We were rock stars or something.</i>

19:17.530 --> 19:19.864
<i>- He was amazing.
- We weren't very good.</i>

19:19.900 --> 19:23.334
<i>And that's when frustration
first set in, you know?</i>

19:23.370 --> 19:28.106
<i>Like, "Oh, okay, this is...
this is tough."</i>

19:28.141 --> 19:31.675
<i>They're not gonna ask you
to join The Rolling Stones.</i>

19:31.711 --> 19:35.479
<i>So then I was thinking
not what I was gonna do,</i>

19:35.515 --> 19:36.881
<i>I was thinking what I wasn't gonna do,</i>

19:36.916 --> 19:39.784
<i>'cause my father had plans for
me to go down to the docks,</i>

19:39.819 --> 19:41.719
<i>where he had a job for me, you know?</i>

19:41.754 --> 19:45.656
I... I'm just... I wanted to do
something that felt special.

19:46.959 --> 19:48.358
<i>Yeah, it was really interesting,</i>

19:48.394 --> 19:49.759
<i>and most people I bumped into</i>

19:49.795 --> 19:52.229
<i>still don't know
what their real passion is,</i>

19:52.264 --> 19:55.265
<i>whereas I was really blessed
to find hip-hop.</i>

19:55.301 --> 19:58.068
<i>At a early age,</i>

19:58.103 --> 19:59.970
<i>Andre had a focus.</i>

20:00.005 --> 20:04.273
- <i>♪ Focus, baby, focus ♪
- ♪ Dre, Dre, Dre ♪</i>

20:04.309 --> 20:07.710
<i>At first, it was
dancing, the Freak Patrol.</i>

20:07.746 --> 20:10.814
Damn, Freak Patrol.
You're taking me back now, okay.

20:10.849 --> 20:13.316
- He had it together.
- It was terrible,

20:13.351 --> 20:15.618
and... I'm actually embarrassed

20:15.654 --> 20:17.086
talking about that shit right now, man.

20:17.121 --> 20:20.489
<i>I would always say,
"You can't get no job pop locking.</i>

20:20.524 --> 20:22.491
<i>You need to find you a job."</i>

20:22.526 --> 20:24.827
And he was always coming in second.

20:24.862 --> 20:26.362
And I remember him saying

20:26.397 --> 20:30.066
<i>that he needed to do something
that he could be first in.</i>

20:30.101 --> 20:33.369
<i>There was a club in the
neighborhood called Eve After Dark.</i>

20:33.404 --> 20:35.871
<i>One of my uncles
was a bouncer at this club,</i>

20:35.906 --> 20:38.740
<i>and he snuck me in one night.
Kurtis Blow was performing,</i>

20:38.776 --> 20:41.724
<i>and his little brother,
Davy DMX, was the DJ.</i>

20:42.516 --> 20:44.804
<i>This is the first time in my
life that I saw scratching.</i>

20:44.815 --> 20:47.649
Just... fucked me up.

20:47.685 --> 20:49.585
<i>I knew that this was my calling.</i>

20:49.620 --> 20:51.419
<i>There was a friend of mine,</i>

20:51.455 --> 20:54.155
<i>he put together two turntables,</i>

20:54.191 --> 20:55.823
<i>and he used a balance knob</i>

20:55.859 --> 20:58.026
to be able to go
from turntable to turntable.

20:58.061 --> 21:02.097
I started doing this thing,
and I just fell in love with it.

21:02.132 --> 21:04.265
<i>All right, are you ready to go off?</i>

21:04.301 --> 21:07.102
<i>Well, check it out. Right about now,

I didn't get here today like you did,

22:54.674 --> 22:57.842
by studying hard
and excelling in school.

22:57.877 --> 22:59.877
Yet, here I stand before you

22:59.913 --> 23:02.847
at this amazing crossroads in your life.

23:02.882 --> 23:04.548
<i>When I graduated high school,</i>

23:04.584 --> 23:07.441
<i>my mother and father said,
"You have to go to college."</i>

23:08.316 --> 23:10.764
<i>I said, "No kidding," because the draft.</i>

23:10.789 --> 23:13.190
<i>I knew if I hated high school...</i>

23:13.226 --> 23:15.892
<i>I was really gonna hate Vietnam.</i>

23:17.096 --> 23:19.230
<i>So they accepted me in John Jay College</i>

23:19.265 --> 23:21.571
<i>of Criminal Justice.
I thought it sounded good,</i>

23:21.596 --> 23:24.400
<i>like maybe that's
what Alfred was in Batman.</i>

23:24.436 --> 23:26.970
Like, I had no idea.
Maybe I was dyslexic.

23:27.006 --> 23:29.539
I don't want to find out now
'cause that'd only rock the boat.

23:29.574 --> 23:33.209
Things are kind of good. But this
was the first time somebody said,

23:33.245 --> 23:36.346
"You're a nice kid. You need
to go do something else."

23:37.949 --> 23:39.549
<i>So he would stay up in his room</i>

23:39.584 --> 23:41.751
<i>and listen to music for hours on end.</i>

23:41.786 --> 23:43.319
<i>I read the back of album covers.</i>

23:43.355 --> 23:45.888
<i>I learned about producing.
That's so cool.</i>

23:45.923 --> 23:49.091
He would make you a super fan
of whatever he was a fan of.

23:49.127 --> 23:51.394
"Do you hear that sound? And do you
know why you hear that sound?"

23:51.429 --> 23:53.630
<i>And he wanted to try the music business.</i>

23:53.665 --> 23:55.364
<i>And I met, through my cousin,</i>

23:55.399 --> 23:57.599
<i>this incredible songwriter,
Ellie Greenwich,</i>

23:57.635 --> 23:59.234
<i>who got me my first studio job.</i>

23:59.270 --> 24:01.570
<i>Jimmy got a job sweeping out the studio,</i>

24:01.605 --> 24:03.472
but somehow he got fired from sweeping.

24:03.507 --> 24:06.909
She got me another job,
and I had 90-day trial.

24:06.944 --> 24:09.378
- <i>On the 89th day...</i>
- He got fired.

24:09.413 --> 24:12.347
You get a kid a job and he gets fired,

24:12.383 --> 24:14.349
you're not gonna get him another job.

24:14.385 --> 24:17.319
<i>So on the way home,
I called Ellie Greenwich.</i>

24:17.354 --> 24:19.588
<i>She said, "Don't get on the train.</i>

24:19.623 --> 24:21.523
<i>Go down to the Record Plant."</i>

24:21.559 --> 24:23.892
<i>And it turns out there were
these two Italian guys.</i>

24:23.927 --> 24:27.062
<i>And this guy, Roy Cicala,
who owned the studio,</i>

24:27.097 --> 24:30.065
<i>was a really groundbreaking
recording engineer.</i>

24:30.100 --> 24:31.432
<i>And how he would teach you</i>

24:31.467 --> 24:35.870
<i>was to work through you.
And we just hit it off.</i>

24:39.209 --> 24:41.375
<i>He sits you at the
console, and he'd say,</i>

24:41.411 --> 24:43.377
<i>"Give me a compressor on the vocal,</i>

24:43.413 --> 24:45.346
<i>"2 dB at 10,000 cycles.</i>

24:45.381 --> 24:47.915
No, try three. No, two sounds better."

24:47.950 --> 24:49.783
<i>And as you're turning the knob,</i>

24:49.819 --> 24:51.785
<i>you're hearing the vocal get brighter.</i>

24:51.821 --> 24:54.288
Or you put the echo on, the tape delay,

24:54.324 --> 24:56.624
and you actually hear it.
He goes, "No, that's too much.

24:56.659 --> 24:59.193
"Have it... all right,
slow the tape machine up a little bit.

24:59.229 --> 25:00.861
Okay, do you hear why that's working?"

25:00.896 --> 25:03.764
And you get a
feel for how to make a record,

25:03.799 --> 25:05.733
<i>because I didn't have any skills.</i>

25:07.436 --> 25:09.937
<i>And then one day, Roy called me at home.</i>

25:09.972 --> 25:12.372
<i>It was Easter Sunday, and he said,</i>

25:12.407 --> 25:15.442
<i>"I need you to come in today
to answer the phones."</i>

25:15.477 --> 25:18.111
<i>Went to my mother. I said,
"Mom, I gotta go to work."</i>

25:18.146 --> 25:20.079
She said, "Are you crazy?
It's Easter Sunday.

25:20.115 --> 25:21.948
"Your family's coming over.
Your aunts, your uncles,

25:21.983 --> 25:23.250
"all your cousins are coming here.

25:23.285 --> 25:24.951
We have to go to church. We have to..."

25:26.888 --> 25:30.457
So, I went into work,
and when I got there...

25:33.027 --> 25:34.994
I went, "Okay."

25:37.766 --> 25:39.431
<i>Roy said, "I just wanted to see</i>

25:39.467 --> 25:41.834
<i>"if you would come in on Easter Sunday.</i>

25:41.870 --> 25:43.736
<i>"The assistant engineer can't make it,</i>

25:43.772 --> 25:45.571

This is the

This was a teenage night club, 1979.

28:29.765 --> 28:31.065
<i>This was where it all started.</i>

28:31.100 --> 28:33.000
Mirrors on the wall.

28:33.036 --> 28:34.835
On a good Saturday night,
if it was packed,

28:34.870 --> 28:36.804
the mirrors would sweat
like it was raining out.

28:36.839 --> 28:39.005
And the ceiling would get hot and moist,

28:39.041 --> 28:40.273
and they'd start to sag.

28:40.309 --> 28:42.943
And we built a stage
out front so that Yella...

28:42.978 --> 28:44.511
- Yella.
<i>- could be seen.</i>

28:44.547 --> 28:46.680
<i>It was just off the chain.</i>

28:46.715 --> 28:49.382
<i>Wreckin' Cru... we were a crew of DJs,</i>

We were just... hot.

28:53.455 --> 28:54.887
But we was always

28:54.923 --> 28:57.122
<i>every weekend for a couple of years.</i>

28:57.158 --> 29:00.826
<i>- Alonzo was the club owner.
- I was the big dog.</i>

29:00.861 --> 29:03.929
<i>That was the guy that you
wanted to know if you wanted to DJ.</i>

29:03.965 --> 29:06.295
<i>One of my boys on
the cleanup crew, kept on...</i>

29:06.320 --> 29:07.866
<i>"Hey, man, you wanna hear my boy Dre?"</i>

29:07.901 --> 29:10.502
I'm like, "Well, I got enough DJs.
I got four DJs already.

29:10.537 --> 29:12.338
"I don't need no fucking more DJs."

29:14.541 --> 29:17.542
<i>At that time, my whole
mission was to get on the turntables.</i>

29:17.578 --> 29:20.512
<i>I didn't give a fuck about anything
else that was going on in the club.</i>

29:20.547 --> 29:22.481
<i>I wasn't tripping on no girls, nothing.</i>

29:22.516 --> 29:25.316
<i>I wanted to be able
to get in there and rock,</i>

29:25.352 --> 29:29.454
<i>and Alonzo used to always be
standing out in front of the club.</i>

29:29.490 --> 29:31.422
<i>'Cause the club was
technically 18 and over.</i>

29:31.458 --> 29:33.157
<i>And I tried to keep it that way.</i>

29:33.193 --> 29:35.626
<i>Him and Eazy came up.
They wasn't dressed right.</i>

29:35.661 --> 29:37.328
<i>So, I like, "No, no, no, no."</i>

29:37.364 --> 29:39.230
<i>Dre started talking to me.</i>

29:39.265 --> 29:41.665
<i>You know, Dre's a smooth-talking
motherfucker, okay?</i>

29:41.701 --> 29:43.901
So I said, "Look, man, change clothes.

29:43.936 --> 29:45.569
Come back and see me next week."

29:45.605 --> 29:48.506
Dre changed clothes. Eazy didn't.

29:48.541 --> 29:51.876
So, just to piss Eazy off, I let Dre in,

29:51.911 --> 29:53.443
made Eazy's ass stand outside.

29:54.747 --> 29:58.081
And how Dre got on the turntables...

29:58.117 --> 30:00.851
if you waterboarded my ass,
I couldn't tell you.

30:00.887 --> 30:04.888
<i>'Cause all I know is, Eazy's

31:50.692 --> 31:51.891
Absolutely.

31:51.927 --> 31:55.028
We want to put together
a show designed by yourself

31:55.063 --> 31:56.296
that says what you want to say,

31:56.332 --> 31:58.232
i.e. takes people as far back

31:58.267 --> 31:59.499
to the history of it as you want to go,

but also as up-to-date with the

32:02.137 --> 32:04.570
We believe that shows like yours
need to be on every other week.

32:04.606 --> 32:06.714
So what we have here is we're looking

32:06.738 --> 32:08.365

32:08.366 --> 32:10.209
That's all of that. Look for the lines.

And you couldn't wait... for it to end.

32:27.928 --> 32:29.428
Hi, Don.

32:29.464 --> 32:32.898
<i>You had two kinds
of guys we ran into at that time.</i>

32:33.868 --> 32:35.467
There were the kinds of guys that wanted

32:35.502 --> 32:37.169
to go home at five o'clock,

32:37.204 --> 32:38.871
<i>and their interest
in what you were doing</i>

32:38.906 --> 32:42.374
didn't exceed the normal
demands of the day for them.

32:42.409 --> 32:45.077
<i>And those guys never lasted.</i>

32:45.112 --> 32:48.513
<i>Because when you're trying to
push the boundaries on things</i>

32:48.549 --> 32:51.316
<i>and when you're moving into
different types of frontiers,</i>

32:51.351 --> 32:55.086
<i>you need to be surrounded by people who
really believe in what you're doing.</i>

32:55.121 --> 32:57.822
<i>And I had never witnessed
anything like that before.</i>

32:57.857 --> 32:59.257
I had never understood that.

32:59.293 --> 33:00.858
Everything I ever did in my life,

33:00.894 --> 33:02.394
I wanted to stop doing it.

33:06.032 --> 33:09.633
Iovine. 'Cause I couldn't hear
myself in the damn headphones.

33:09.669 --> 33:11.903
What else is new?

33:21.842 --> 33:24.348
<i>Bruce taught me a work ethic.</i>

33:29.722 --> 33:32.389
<i>In 1975,</i>

33:32.425 --> 33:34.391
<i>we're trying to make "Born to Run,"</i>

33:34.427 --> 33:37.094
<i>and we're having
great difficulty doing so.</i>

33:39.765 --> 33:42.232
<i>Walked into the Record Plant.</i>

33:42.267 --> 33:46.737
<i>This was our first step inside a
professional recording studio.</i>

33:46.772 --> 33:49.940
<i>A skinny, little Italian kid,</i>

33:49.975 --> 33:51.708
<i>sitting at the tape machine.</i>

33:51.744 --> 33:55.345
Basic job was to take
the tape on and off,

33:55.380 --> 33:58.548
push the stop and start button.

33:58.583 --> 34:00.416
That was Jimmy Iovine.

34:01.519 --> 34:02.918
<i>He came with the furniture.</i>

34:02.954 --> 34:04.754
<i>I did come with the furniture.</i>

34:05.857 --> 34:07.923
<i>And I came in a few nights later,</i>

34:07.959 --> 34:09.859
<i>and our engineer was gone.</i>

34:09.893 --> 34:13.262
<i>Landau looked to me
and said, "Can you do this?"</i>

34:13.297 --> 34:15.697
<i>And I wasn't really sure
if I could do it or not,</i>

34:15.733 --> 34:17.666
<i>but I said, "Yeah, why not?"</i>

34:17.701 --> 34:21.070
<i>And that was my first solo flight.</i>

34:38.989 --> 34:40.955
<i>The center of what he's doing</i>

34:40.991 --> 34:43.891
is to try and create an artistic vision.

34:43.927 --> 34:46.094
<i>There was an intellectual aspect to it.</i>

34:46.129 --> 34:48.396
<i>We were just very, very determined.</i>

34:48.431 --> 34:51.766

34:51.802 --> 34:56.204

34:56.239 --> 34:58.673

<i>But it was simply understood</i>

35:02.845 --> 35:06.514
<i>that you're there because you believe
what we're doing is worth it.</i>

35:06.549 --> 35:10.250

35:26.468 --> 35:28.435

35:31.673 --> 35:35.174

- Stick.

36:02.536 --> 36:03.903
But I wasn't saying, "I'm sorry,"

36:03.938 --> 36:06.138

dragging through the mill.

36:06.174 --> 36:07.406
<i>Coffee wasn't working anymore.</i>

36:07.441 --> 36:09.875

36:18.118 --> 36:19.217

36:19.253 --> 36:21.687
<i>The engineer would take the blame,</i>

36:21.722 --> 36:26.358
<i>and I was not above laying it
upon him until we got our sounds.</i>

36:26.393 --> 36:29.194
<i>It's a stick hitting a drum.</i>

36:29.229 --> 36:32.297

<i>He made an impression on me immediately.</i>

43:05.579 --> 43:08.012
<i>If Bruce wasn't there working,</i>

43:08.047 --> 43:10.214
<i>he would stay for hours</i>

43:10.250 --> 43:14.118
<i>and study other people's
mixes, other albums.</i>

43:14.154 --> 43:15.654
<i>He'd find some old tape</i>

43:15.689 --> 43:17.689
<i>to see if he could improve that.</i>

43:17.724 --> 43:19.557
<i>He worked all the time.</i>

43:19.593 --> 43:22.827
<i>I said to myself,
"No fun, no life, no nothing.</i>

43:22.862 --> 43:26.197
<i>You're gonna give up everything and
put a hundred percent into this."</i>

43:26.232 --> 43:29.267
That's the kind of guy I wanted.

43:29.302 --> 43:31.568
<i>So Jimmy, unbeknownst to us,</i>

43:31.604 --> 43:34.172
<i>is working with Patti as a producer</i>

43:34.207 --> 43:36.373
<i>while he's engineering our record,</i>

43:36.409 --> 43:38.375
and she was coming in
in the middle of the night.

43:39.779 --> 43:43.781
<i>I had had a serious
accident in the beginning of '77,</i>

43:43.816 --> 43:47.184
<i>and I was way behind
preparing for the album.</i>

43:47.219 --> 43:49.886
<i>We didn't have a whole lot of songs.</i>

43:49.922 --> 43:53.590
<i>We didn't have a single
to get you into the album.</i>

43:53.626 --> 43:56.659
<i>Now, Bruce had this
song that was not quite</i>

43:56.695 --> 43:59.662
<i>at the center of the album
that he was making,</i>

43:59.698 --> 44:02.532
<i>but he suspected
that if it was on there,</i>

44:02.567 --> 44:05.735
that might be the focus.
He didn't want it.

44:05.770 --> 44:07.838
I really don't know to this day

44:07.873 --> 44:11.441
how Jimmy wangled
this song out of Bruce.

44:11.476 --> 44:15.411
<i>He took me out
to Coney Island for a drive,</i>

44:15.447 --> 44:20.516
and somehow he let slip,
"Hey, I'm producing now."

44:20.552 --> 44:23.052
"Great." "You know that
song, 'Because the Night'?"

44:23.087 --> 44:25.421
"Yes, I do." "Are you gonna use it?"

44:25.457 --> 44:26.756
"No, I don't think I am."

44:26.791 --> 44:29.358
"Do you mind if I give it
to Patti Smith?"

44:29.393 --> 44:32.027
"Bruce, this song w... I mean, we...

44:32.063 --> 44:34.830
"how could we give...
how could we pass on this song

44:34.866 --> 44:36.398
being on your album? Are you crazy?"

44:36.433 --> 44:38.934
He says, "Yeah, but, you know, it's..."

44:38.970 --> 44:40.502
So, I brought it to Patti.

44:40.537 --> 44:41.636
"Would you listen to it?

44:41.672 --> 44:44.306
Maybe you wanna, you know, collaborate."

44:44.342 --> 44:48.276
And I was like, "Jimmy, you know,
I only want to write my own songs."

44:48.311 --> 44:50.211
<i>So I took this cassette,</i>

44:50.247 --> 44:51.913
<i>I went back to my little apartment,</i>

44:51.948 --> 44:55.283
<i>and I put it on the mantle
and then forgot about it.</i>

44:55.318 --> 44:56.785
<i>Even now it makes me laugh.</i>

44:56.820 --> 44:59.220
Every day I come to the studio,
he wouldn't say hello to me.

44:59.256 --> 45:02.623
He'd say, "Did you listen to the song?
Listen to the song?"

45:02.658 --> 45:04.325
I said, "Eh, I didn't listen to it yet."

45:04.361 --> 45:07.795
"Should we go back to your
apartment, listen to this song?"

45:07.830 --> 45:10.598
<i>For days, "Did you listen to the song?"</i>

45:14.570 --> 45:17.238
<i>At that time, I was building a romance</i>

45:17.274 --> 45:20.374
<i>with my future husband,
Fred "Sonic" Smith,</i>

45:20.410 --> 45:24.445
<i>and he lived in Detroit, so I only
got to talk to him once a week.</i>

45:24.480 --> 45:26.947
<i>I'm home, and I'm waiting
for Fred to call.</i>

45:26.982 --> 45:29.450
<i>7:30 comes. He doesn't call.</i>

45:29.485 --> 45:32.686
<i>Eight o'clock comes.
I was getting really agitated.</i>

45:32.722 --> 45:35.422
<i>And I noticed the tape
sitting on the mantle,</i>

45:35.457 --> 45:38.558
<i>and I thought, "Oh, I'll
listen to that darn song."</i>

45:38.593 --> 45:40.660
<i>♪ Take me now, baby ♪</i>

45:40.695 --> 45:42.896
<i>♪ Here as I am ♪</i>

45:42.932 --> 45:44.764
<i>♪ Pull me close ♪</i>

45:44.800 --> 45:47.234
<i>♪ Try and understand ♪</i>

45:47.269 --> 45:52.605
I put it on, and it's flawlessly
produced, great chorus.

45:52.641 --> 45:55.942
<i>It's in my key. It's anthemic.</i>

45:55.977 --> 45:58.010
<i>♪ Come on now ♪</i>

45:58.046 --> 46:00.112
<i>♪ Try and understand ♪</i>

46:01.249 --> 46:04.617
<i>So Fred finally calls me,
like, almost midnight.</i>

46:04.653 --> 46:06.719
- <i>♪ Take my hand ♪
- But by midnight,</i>

46:06.755 --> 46:08.587
<i>I had written all the lyrics.</i>

46:08.622 --> 46:11.357
"Have I doubt, when I'm alone,

46:11.392 --> 46:14.860
love is a ring, the telephone."

46:14.895 --> 46:16.462
<i>I was waiting for Fred.</i>

46:16.497 --> 46:20.699
<i>♪ Because the night belongs to lovers ♪</i>

46:20.734 --> 46:24.670
<i>♪ Because the night belongs to love ♪</i>

46:24.705 --> 46:28.607
<i>♪ Because the night belongs to lovers ♪</i>

46:28.642 --> 46:30.375
<i>♪ Because the night ♪</i>

46:30.410 --> 46:32.611
<i>♪ Belongs to love ♪</i>

46:32.646 --> 46:34.580
The next day, Jimmy goes...

46:35.449 --> 46:36.849
"Did you listen to the song?"

46:36.884 --> 46:38.517
I said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."

46:38.552 --> 46:40.051
"What'd you think?"
"I wrote lyrics to it."

46:40.087 --> 46:41.519
"What? Where are they?"

46:41.554 --> 46:43.154
<i>In, like, two days, we recorded it.</i>

46:43.190 --> 46:46.057
<i>Now, Bruce had
accomplished a great deal by then.</i>

46:46.093 --> 46:48.326
One thing he hadn't had
was a top 10 single.

46:48.362 --> 46:49.427
Pop!

46:49.463 --> 46:51.262
<i>We hadn't finished with</i> Darkness,

46:51.298 --> 46:54.499
<i>so while Jimmy is engineering our album,</i>

46:54.534 --> 46:55.800
<i>this comes out,</i>

46:55.835 --> 46:58.769
<i>and the single goes to top 10.</i>

46:58.805 --> 47:02.272
<i>There is the talent of Jimmy Iovine.</i>

47:02.308 --> 47:06.844
<i>He eases in, and in his
very slippery way,</i>

47:06.880 --> 47:08.613
<i>greases all the wheels</i>

47:08.648 --> 47:11.181
<i>so things happen at a certain moment.</i>

47:11.217 --> 47:13.683
<i>And Jimmy Iovine works his magic.</i>

47:14.853 --> 47:16.053
So exciting.

47:16.088 --> 47:18.822
I mean, I'd walk down the street

47:18.857 --> 47:20.557
<i>in the Village, in New York,</i>

47:20.592 --> 47:24.794
<i>and it would be coming out of
boom boxes or every record store.</i>

47:24.830 --> 47:27.898
<i>In fact, I got flack for that,
because people were saying,</i>

47:27.933 --> 47:29.666
<i>"Oh, you know, you sold out.</i>

47:29.701 --> 47:32.468
<i>You're a punk rocker,
and you have a hit song."</i>

47:32.504 --> 47:34.604
<i>And I said, "Punk rock is about freedom.</i>

47:34.640 --> 47:36.773
<i>"It's not about your chart position.</i>

47:36.808 --> 47:39.543
And I'll sing any fucking song I want."

47:45.450 --> 47:48.851
<i>It wasn't that Jimmy
wanted to be the number one guy.</i>

47:48.886 --> 47:51.154
<i>It was like he was ambitious for you.</i>

47:51.189 --> 47:54.457
<i>And, uh... he was ambitious for me.</i>

47:54.492 --> 47:57.460
<i>You always felt that his whole goal</i>

47:57.495 --> 48:00.563
<i>was for the world to see
what he was seeing.</i>

48:10.775 --> 48:13.742
- Wow.
- It's beautiful.

48:13.778 --> 48:16.011
- Iovine.
- Yes, Sir.

48:16.047 --> 48:18.013
Good idea, right?

48:18.049 --> 48:19.081
This is nutso.

48:19.116 --> 48:21.216
See that roundish building over there?

48:21.251 --> 48:23.518
Like, the end of this block,

48:23.554 --> 48:25.135
it sort of curves at the end?

48:25.190 --> 48:30.225
- When I was 23 years old...
- Yeah.

48:30.260 --> 48:31.693
I had an apartment in that building.

48:31.728 --> 48:32.827
- Really?
- It was...

48:32.862 --> 48:35.930
- Overlooking the park?
- Yep, it was $1,400 a month.

48:35.966 --> 48:37.565
Shit.

48:37.601 --> 48:39.901
- Times have changed.
- Yeah.

48:39.936 --> 48:41.970
$1,400 a month, right now...

48:42.005 --> 48:43.871
<i>You know, people become successful,</i>

48:43.907 --> 48:49.744
<i>and they get locked into the behaviors
that led them to be a success.</i>

48:49.779 --> 48:52.646
<i>Jimmy was very, very good at letting go</i>

48:52.681 --> 48:57.418
of the things that might have
made him a success to this point.

48:57.453 --> 48:59.119
He's willing to shed that...

48:59.154 --> 49:02.388
<i>and go for something completely else,</i>

49:02.424 --> 49:05.558
<i>and not afraid to partner</i>

49:05.594 --> 49:07.860
<i>with other very visionary people.</i>

49:07.895 --> 49:10.430
<i>So, Jimmy's career is based</i>

49:10.465 --> 49:14.734
on a tremendous lack
of fear of moving forward.

49:21.109 --> 49:24.343
<i>It was scary for me, leaving the group,</i>

49:24.378 --> 49:28.047
<i>'cause I was separating
myself from this thing</i>

49:28.082 --> 49:31.450
that taught me everything
I knew up till then,

49:31.485 --> 49:33.519
and just taking that
little bit of knowledge

49:33.554 --> 49:36.888
that I had and trying
to go off on my own

49:36.923 --> 49:38.857
and create something entirely new.

49:40.594 --> 49:42.561
<i>But I knew I had this talent,</i>

49:42.596 --> 49:44.630
<i>and I knew I gotta just step up,</i>

49:44.665 --> 49:47.399
<i>be my own man, so I took the gamble.</i>

49:48.501 --> 49:51.569
<i>But I was limited on equipment,</i>

49:51.604 --> 49:54.673
<i>and the only person I knew that
had money at that time was Eazy.</i>

49:54.708 --> 49:56.908
<i>He was selling drugs, and, you know.</i>

49:56.943 --> 49:57.976
<i>He was a hustler.</i>

49:58.011 --> 49:58.977
<i>Eazy had money.</i>

49:59.012 --> 50:01.379
<i>Eazy wanted to get
into the music business,</i>

50:01.414 --> 50:02.814
<i>to be a label owner.</i>

50:02.849 --> 50:04.715
<i>So, me and Eazy,</i>

50:04.750 --> 50:07.351
<i>we decided to start a label
called Ruthless Records.</i>

50:07.387 --> 50:10.555
<i>And I wanted to do
something for the streets,</i>

50:10.590 --> 50:12.723
<i>something that the guys in the park</i>

50:12.758 --> 50:14.091
<i>were gonna be able to relate to,</i>

50:14.126 --> 50:17.695
<i>'cause New York had everything
covered as far as hip-hop.</i>

50:17.730 --> 50:21.865
<i>But West Coast hip-hop in '86
was pretty much nonexistent,</i>

50:21.901 --> 50:24.768
<i>so I convinced Cube
to write a song for us.</i>

50:24.804 --> 50:27.237
And I wrote "Boyz-n-the-Hood" for him.

50:27.272 --> 50:29.472
<i>Los Angeles has a car culture.</i>

50:29.508 --> 50:32.542
<i>If you didn't have subwoofers
in your car, you wasn't shit.</i>

50:32.578 --> 50:36.046
<i>That's what made me start paying
attention to sonics and clarity.</i>

50:36.082 --> 50:37.947
<i>And when we did "Boyz-n-the-Hood,"</i>

50:37.982 --> 50:40.550
<i>I wanted to make sure that
those subwoofers were working.</i>

50:40.586 --> 50:42.652
It was so powerful, your jaw dropped.

50:42.688 --> 50:45.689
<i>I'm much better
and much more comfortable</i>

50:45.724 --> 50:47.990
<i>directing an artist
than being an artist myself,</i>

50:48.026 --> 50:53.162
<i>and Eazy had this creative part
about him that was just so street.</i>

50:53.198 --> 50:56.933
<i>So I decided, "I'm gonna talk
Eazy into recording this record."</i>

50:56.968 --> 50:58.801
<i>He looked at me like I was nuts.</i>

50:58.837 --> 51:00.870
<i>He kept saying, "I'm not a rapper.</i>

51:00.905 --> 51:02.504
<i>I've never rapped before in my life."</i>

51:02.540 --> 51:04.874
<i>But I had a baby at the time.
I needed money.</i>

51:04.909 --> 51:07.176
<i>I was determined to get
him to do this song.</i>

51:07.212 --> 51:09.612
<i>I had no idea how it was gonna come out.</i>

51:09.647 --> 51:11.513
<i>As a matter of fact, I didn't
think it was gonna work,</i>

51:11.549 --> 51:15.117
<i>but I spent two hours talking him
into getting on the microphone.</i>

51:15.152 --> 51:17.653
<i>And finally, he makes
me turn the lights off,</i>

51:17.688 --> 51:20.822
<i>he puts on dark glasses,
and we got started.</i>
