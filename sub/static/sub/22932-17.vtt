One person here
will be found guilty.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.040
The other, not guilty.

10:25.040 --> 10:26.040
Thank you.

10:34.580 --> 10:36.540
[Lewie] So you claim you could
not have damaged the car

10:36.540 --> 10:39.170
because you were elsewhere
at the time of the incident.

10:39.170 --> 10:40.620
Where were you?

10:40.620 --> 10:42.120
The attic.

10:42.120 --> 10:44.120
Ah. The attic.

10:44.120 --> 10:45.380
Playing roll-ball,
no doubt.

10:46.670 --> 10:48.330
And did you set
a high score

10:48.330 --> 10:50.790
that would prove you were
in the attic at the time?

10:50.790 --> 10:52.710
Uh, no.

10:54.210 --> 10:55.250
And why not?

10:55.250 --> 10:56.670
And remember,

10:56.670 --> 10:58.040
you're under oath.

11:02.040 --> 11:04.040
I'm not very good.

11:04.040 --> 11:05.460
[Lewie]
What was that?

11:06.460 --> 11:08.330
I'm bad at roll-ball, okay?

11:08.330 --> 11:11.330
The only win I've ever had
was against Deathne.

11:11.330 --> 11:13.120
Yes! Ha!

11:14.670 --> 11:18.620
Sad. The man can only
beat a doll.

11:18.620 --> 11:21.790
I think it's fair to say
he's so bad at roll-ball--

11:21.790 --> 11:23.500
terrible, really--

11:23.500 --> 11:26.460
that it's plausible he spent
hours in the attic

11:26.460 --> 11:28.000
practicing with nothing
to show for it,

11:28.000 --> 11:29.790
because he's terrible.

11:29.790 --> 11:31.040
They get it.

11:32.790 --> 11:34.960
Hmm. I remember
hearing someone

11:34.960 --> 11:36.330
stomping around
up there yesterday.

11:36.330 --> 11:38.880
I guess, based on alibis,
it had to be Ethan.

11:38.880 --> 11:41.170
You're the judge,
not a witness.

11:44.040 --> 11:45.040
Look at their faces.

11:45.040 --> 11:47.210
That's a solid alibi.

11:47.210 --> 11:49.120
Even I'm starting to think
he didn't do it.

11:50.460 --> 11:51.710
Me too.

11:51.710 --> 11:53.170
Wish he was my client.

11:56.040 --> 11:57.540
So at the time of the crash,

11:57.540 --> 12:00.080
you were working on this
shoe-dirt knocker-off-er?

12:00.080 --> 12:02.790
Yes, and it's called
the Mat-o-Matic.

12:02.790 --> 12:04.710
It's a special doormat
to clean your shoes

12:04.710 --> 12:06.170
before you go
in the house.

12:06.170 --> 12:08.460
Objection! Boring!

12:08.460 --> 12:10.000
It'll help the whole family.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.830
Ah. Help...

12:12.830 --> 12:15.290
the whole family.

12:15.290 --> 12:17.830
Is that something
a criminal would say?

12:17.830 --> 12:20.330
Objection!
Kissing up to the jury.

12:21.620 --> 12:22.880
[dice rattle]

12:22.880 --> 12:24.210
-Four!
-Five!

12:25.420 --> 12:26.880
Six. Overruled.

12:26.880 --> 12:28.210
Yes! I win!

12:31.540 --> 12:32.880
[pants ripping]

12:42.710 --> 12:44.000
That's it?

12:44.000 --> 12:46.620
I partied so hard
I blew out my pants.

12:46.620 --> 12:48.210
Not sure what more
you want.

12:48.210 --> 12:51.000
Don't you want to mention
how yesterday was the only day

12:51.000 --> 12:52.540
I could've worked
on the invention,

12:52.540 --> 12:54.460
which proves my alibi?

12:58.000 --> 13:01.290
Sure, let's hear more
about that.

13:01.290 --> 13:02.580
[sighs]

13:02.580 --> 13:04.580
I had to be working
on my invention,

13:04.580 --> 13:06.920
because I hadn't even received
the most important part

13:06.920 --> 13:08.500
until that morning.

13:08.500 --> 13:10.250
And I can prove it.

13:10.250 --> 13:12.790
Yes, I signed for your package
yesterday.

13:12.790 --> 13:14.500
House bursting at the seams
with children,

13:14.500 --> 13:16.500
yet never anyone
to sign for a delivery.

13:16.500 --> 13:21.210
Anyway, yes, Harley picked up
the package around 10:00 a.m.

13:21.210 --> 13:23.960
I told her I was always happy
to help a young inventor.

13:23.960 --> 13:25.790
And just so you know,
my purpose in life

13:25.790 --> 13:27.040
isn't to serve
as a "storage" center

13:27.040 --> 13:29.250
for your mail order
doodads.

13:31.420 --> 13:33.580
So my client could not have
picked up the part at 10:00,

13:33.580 --> 13:38.040
crashed the car and still had
time to complete her invention.

13:40.120 --> 13:42.120
Yeah! Uh-huh.

13:42.120 --> 13:43.120
Uh-huh.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.210
[bangs gavel

13:46.210 --> 13:48.080
Cease and desist
on the victory dance.

13:48.080 --> 13:50.210
I'm seeing a little
too much tush back here.

13:50.210 --> 13:51.580
[sighs]

13:51.580 --> 13:53.920
Yes, way too much.

13:53.920 --> 13:55.880
That's a lovely brooch
you have, Miss Peters.

13:55.880 --> 13:57.170
Thank you.

13:57.170 --> 13:58.710
Tell me,
were you wearing it

13:58.710 --> 14:01.460
at the time you committed
mail fraud?

14:01.460 --> 14:02.880
Excuse me?

14:02.880 --> 14:05.040
In order for you to know
what was in that package,

14:05.040 --> 14:06.080
you would've had to open it.

14:06.080 --> 14:07.710
[Bethany]
I would never.

14:07.710 --> 14:10.290
It's against the law
to open someone else's mail.

14:10.290 --> 14:11.920
Oh, dear.

14:11.920 --> 14:14.750
Then I guess you can't
say for sure

14:14.750 --> 14:17.120
Harley's invention part
was in that package.

14:17.120 --> 14:18.830
And therefore,
you can't say

14:18.830 --> 14:20.790
Harley was working
on her invention.

14:23.790 --> 14:25.330
Maybe she was working
on something else.

14:25.330 --> 14:28.620
Like, say, video chatting
with your nephew

14:28.620 --> 14:30.460
and smashing the car
into the garage?

14:33.290 --> 14:35.250
It's making me uncomfortable
how much Harley's losing.

14:35.250 --> 14:36.500
We need to take a break.

14:39.750 --> 14:41.170
Looks like Lewie's
winning streak

14:41.170 --> 14:43.120
isn't going to be ending
anytime soon.

14:43.120 --> 14:44.960
It's pretty clear
you didn't do it.

14:44.960 --> 14:46.540
And I know you didn't
do it either.

14:46.540 --> 14:49.620
When you're lying, you throw
your hands up and walk away.

14:49.620 --> 14:50.920
And you didn't do that.

14:50.920 --> 14:53.290
BFTF. You know me.

14:54.290 --> 14:56.710
But the trial's
not going my way,

14:56.710 --> 14:58.290
so I'm just going
to plead guilty.

14:58.290 --> 14:59.920
What? No.

14:59.920 --> 15:02.830
Maybe we can get Lewie
to pin it on Rachel.

15:02.830 --> 15:04.580
She's an ocean away,
but he's good.

15:04.580 --> 15:07.330
No. One of us
has to take the blame.

15:07.330 --> 15:10.290
There's no point in both of us
going to lockdown.

15:10.290 --> 15:12.880
I'll be your character witness,
so Mom and Dad go easy on you.

15:12.880 --> 15:14.250
And they probably will.

15:14.250 --> 15:16.540
After all,
my first word was "love."

15:16.540 --> 15:18.330
It was "shoe."

15:18.330 --> 15:20.170
Wow, we do know
each other.

15:22.580 --> 15:24.080
Court is back in session.

15:24.080 --> 15:25.750
Also, be advised
I'm moving from dice

15:25.750 --> 15:27.790
to One Potato, Two Potato.

15:27.790 --> 15:29.250
No need.

15:29.250 --> 15:31.330
I'm going to end this thing.

15:31.330 --> 15:32.750
[Beast]
Wait!

15:34.290 --> 15:36.710
I'd like to call
a surprise witness.

15:36.710 --> 15:38.000
I object.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.460
That's our Peeby and Jay car.

15:39.460 --> 15:42.250
Plus, Harley's already had
a surprise witness.

15:42.250 --> 15:44.920
Daphne's been on the razor's
edge of a tantrum all day.

15:44.920 --> 15:46.460
I'm not telling her "no."

15:46.460 --> 15:47.880
[scoffs]

15:47.880 --> 15:50.790
I call to the stand
Captain Sasha Phluff.

15:52.080 --> 15:55.290
Ethan says he was in the attic,

15:55.290 --> 15:57.420
but we all know he records
his music in the car.

15:57.420 --> 15:59.710
According to the time stamp,

15:59.710 --> 16:02.420
a song was uploaded
to our cloud yesterday,

16:02.420 --> 16:05.620
and then deleted right after
our family meeting.

16:08.500 --> 16:10.500
So, Ethan was in the car.

16:11.790 --> 16:13.250
And he tried
to cover it up!

16:14.290 --> 16:15.540
You did it,

16:15.540 --> 16:17.330
and you were going to let me
take the blame?

16:19.000 --> 16:21.040
I-I... uh...

16:21.040 --> 16:22.380
I can't believe it.

16:22.380 --> 16:25.620
Turns out the "B" in BFTF
stands for "betrayal."

16:34.170 --> 16:36.290
It's not how it looks.

16:36.290 --> 16:37.580
Really?

16:37.580 --> 16:39.830
Because it looks like
you lied to my face.

16:39.830 --> 16:43.000
And worse, you were going
to let me take the punishment.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.120
Luckily, Phluff was
on the case.

16:45.120 --> 16:47.080
And she's one heck of a cop.

16:47.080 --> 16:48.920
I swear, I didn't do it.

16:48.920 --> 16:50.380
Then play the song.

16:50.380 --> 16:52.040
Show us you're not
hiding something.

16:53.290 --> 16:54.710
I can't.

16:54.710 --> 16:58.080
And I want to believe you,
but I can't.

16:58.080 --> 16:59.580
Harley, look, it's--

16:59.580 --> 17:01.790
Save it for the stand.

17:01.790 --> 17:03.500
You're my next witness.

17:06.380 --> 17:08.120
[sighs]

17:10.330 --> 17:12.120
I swear,
I can do this.

17:12.120 --> 17:13.540
I changed my pants
and everything.

17:13.540 --> 17:15.580
I'm sorry.
But if this goes my way,

17:15.580 --> 17:17.460
you can still
do the victory dance.

17:19.460 --> 17:22.500
Shouldn't Beast
be asking questions?

17:22.500 --> 17:25.460
The judge is using a meat
tenderizer and rolling dice.

17:25.460 --> 17:27.170
I think the ship has sailed
on protocol.

17:27.170 --> 17:28.460
Yeah.

17:28.460 --> 17:31.460
If there's one thing
I know about Ethan Diaz,

17:31.460 --> 17:34.460
it's that he never
deletes a song for good.

17:36.040 --> 17:37.710
No matter how many times
we ask him to.

17:40.170 --> 17:44.540
So, I ask that the witness
let us hear that recording.

17:44.540 --> 17:45.580
I can't.

17:47.170 --> 17:49.920
Because he knows
it also contains the sound

17:49.920 --> 17:51.960
of the car smashing
into the garage.

17:55.670 --> 17:57.620
I think we all know
who's lying here today.

17:57.620 --> 17:58.880
[sighs]

17:58.880 --> 18:00.500
I rest my case.

18:04.920 --> 18:06.540
The end.

18:07.830 --> 18:10.540
Hey, that was the end, right?

18:15.500 --> 18:16.880
Now it's up to the jury.

18:16.880 --> 18:19.460
Hopefully Mom and Dad
see through Ethan's fake story

18:19.460 --> 18:21.620
faster than I did.

18:21.620 --> 18:23.790
I'm just sorry I couldn't
help you more.

18:23.790 --> 18:26.500
Hey, you did your best.

18:26.500 --> 18:29.710
You put on a suit
and blew out the pants.

18:29.710 --> 18:31.540
But no one wants me
as their lawyer.

18:31.540 --> 18:33.170
Everyone wants Lewie.

18:33.170 --> 18:35.620
That's not true.

18:35.620 --> 18:37.170
He's the one
who always wins.

18:37.170 --> 18:40.040
He has the fancy words,
the glasses.

18:40.040 --> 18:42.710
He even beat me
at being born.

18:42.710 --> 18:45.830
Just once, I wanted
to save the day.

18:47.210 --> 18:48.880
You can't without proof.

18:48.880 --> 18:50.620
And we had none.

18:51.920 --> 18:54.250
Yeah, it's weird Ethan
would delete a file

18:54.250 --> 18:57.170
when the cloud gets backed up
to Dad's laptop.

18:57.170 --> 18:58.580
What?

18:58.580 --> 18:59.880
It does?

18:59.880 --> 19:01.580
Yeah, Rachel set it up

19:01.580 --> 19:04.620
after I erased her fashion vlogs
by mistake.

19:04.620 --> 19:06.580
That came out fast.

19:08.580 --> 19:10.580
That means the file
Ethan deleted

19:10.580 --> 19:12.250
is still on Dad's laptop.

19:12.250 --> 19:14.620
If I find it,
I'll have the evidence I need

19:14.620 --> 19:16.290
to crack this case wide open.

19:16.290 --> 19:19.040
Beast, you did save the day.

19:19.040 --> 19:20.750
Without even meaning to.

19:20.750 --> 19:22.620
Nice!

19:22.620 --> 19:24.830
I'll take you
as my lawyer anytime.

19:24.830 --> 19:27.750
Thanks, but I'd rather
be court reporter,

19:27.750 --> 19:29.670
now that I know
they get to shred stuff.

19:29.670 --> 19:30.960
[laughs]

19:33.580 --> 19:34.960
Look what I got.

19:34.960 --> 19:36.750
And it's all ours.

19:36.750 --> 19:38.670
I had the delivery guy
meet me at Bethany's.

19:38.670 --> 19:40.210
I was afraid the kids
would smell the egg rolls.

19:40.210 --> 19:41.670
Genius.

19:41.670 --> 19:43.710
I hope another kid
does something wrong soon.

19:43.710 --> 19:45.790
There's an Indian place
that just opened.

19:45.790 --> 19:46.920
-Ooh.

19:49.830 --> 19:50.920
Hello?

19:50.920 --> 19:52.170
Oh.

19:52.170 --> 19:53.830
You're kidding me.

19:53.830 --> 19:55.210
Ooh, that changes
everything.

19:56.790 --> 19:58.670
All right, thanks for
letting me know.

19:58.670 --> 20:00.330
Huh. We have our verdict.

20:00.330 --> 20:02.920
I didn't even get
to open my chopsticks.

20:05.830 --> 20:07.790
Yes! That's what
I'm looking for.

20:07.790 --> 20:10.040
Ethan, you are so going down.

20:10.040 --> 20:13.790
Ugh, how many times
am I going to mess this up?

20:13.790 --> 20:18.000
All right, video invite

want me to hear.

20:39.830 --> 20:41.710
[Daphne]
Great, you're back.

20:41.710 --> 20:43.880
Let's end this and eat
the Chinese food Dad snuck in.

20:45.670 --> 20:47.040
Phluff misses nothing.

20:47.040 --> 20:48.670
Where's Harley?

20:50.170 --> 20:51.880
I'm guilty. It was me.

20:51.880 --> 20:53.710
Punish me.

20:54.880 --> 20:56.670
What are you
talking about?

20:56.670 --> 20:58.830
Super shocking plea
coming your way.

20:58.830 --> 21:00.290
E-man didn't do it.

21:00.290 --> 21:02.170
That's all I got to say.

21:02.170 --> 21:04.170
You found the song.

21:05.750 --> 21:06.750
Not sure what this is,

21:06.750 --> 21:08.750
but we reached
a different verdict.

21:08.750 --> 21:10.670
Yeah. Uh...

21:10.670 --> 21:12.210
I got a call
from our mechanic.

21:12.210 --> 21:14.380
It turns out the car
has a faulty transmission.

21:14.380 --> 21:16.710
It can slip out of gear
for almost no reason.

21:16.710 --> 21:19.080
[Suzy]
That must be why it rolled
into the garage.

21:19.080 --> 21:21.040
No one did it...
this time.

21:21.040 --> 21:24.920
So, sorry for suspecting you...
this time.

21:24.920 --> 21:26.000
[sighs]

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
"Sorry" was a little
buried in there.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.830
But thanks.

21:31.420 --> 21:33.920
I just want to take off
this itchy wig.

21:33.920 --> 21:35.790
Case closed!

21:35.790 --> 21:37.120
[all cheer]

21:37.120 --> 21:39.960
[Harley]
In the case of BFTF v BFTF,

21:39.960 --> 21:44.080
the Diaz family court concludes
a mistrial.

Yo. E-Man out.

[all cheer]

22:17.710 --> 22:18.920
That was so good!

22:18.920 --> 22:20.380
[Harley]
Life is tricky.

22:20.380 --> 22:22.710
It's not always easy to know
who's on your side.

22:22.710 --> 22:25.120
But even when
there's reasonable doubt,

22:25.120 --> 22:27.750
there are some people
you should always believe in.
