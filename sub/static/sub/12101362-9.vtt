00:02.127 --> 00:03.586
Previously on Dynasty...

00:03.628 --> 00:05.088
Hello, is this Oliver Knoble?

00:05.130 --> 00:06.381
I'm a friend
of your ex-girlfriend. Kirby?

00:06.423 --> 00:07.674
Cristal? You okay?

00:07.716 --> 00:09.759
I have a brain tumor.

00:09.801 --> 00:11.678
I got to be straight with Jeff,
so do you want me to tell him,

00:11.720 --> 00:13.346
or do you want
to let him down first?

00:13.388 --> 00:15.974
I like you both, so I was
planning on dating you both.

00:16.016 --> 00:17.183
Good morning, handsome.

00:17.225 --> 00:19.394
Sorry. I didn't mean
to wake you.

00:19.436 --> 00:22.689
You traded a nonsinking house
for an empty hole in the ground.

00:22.731 --> 00:24.399
And I will give you

00:24.441 --> 00:26.985
the full 24 hours
to vacate the premises.

00:27.027 --> 00:28.653
(shouting)

00:28.695 --> 00:30.321
(wood creaking, rocks tumbling)

00:37.787 --> 00:39.247
BLAKE:
Thank you, Jeremiah.

00:39.289 --> 00:40.915
And make sure
the rest of the staff knows

00:40.957 --> 00:44.044
to remove all other vestiges
of Alexis's time here.

00:44.085 --> 00:46.713
Taking a more active role
in management this time around?

00:46.755 --> 00:48.423
Well, just making myself
a visible presence

00:48.465 --> 00:50.675
so everyone knows
who's in charge.

00:50.717 --> 00:53.386
And removing the havoc
of Alexis.

00:53.428 --> 00:55.221
Which is everywhere.

00:55.263 --> 00:57.891
It appears she has no interest
in claiming her possessions.

00:57.932 --> 00:59.392
Well, that's not a problem.

00:59.434 --> 01:02.312
We'll just collect it all
in a big pile for her.

01:02.353 --> 01:03.855
If you see her, let her know

01:03.897 --> 01:05.648
that anything still here
tomorrow will be donated.

01:05.690 --> 01:09.527
And by donated, I mean burned.

01:12.405 --> 01:14.199
Stop yelling at me!

01:14.240 --> 01:16.659
I'll stop yelling
if you push harder.

01:16.701 --> 01:18.995
You use your legs,
not your back.

01:19.037 --> 01:20.080
Everyone knows that.

01:20.121 --> 01:21.706
Oh. (groans)

01:21.748 --> 01:25.085
Oh, God. You're as useless below
ground as you are above.

01:25.126 --> 01:28.838
Oh, I'm sorry, is
my "trapped in a mine" behavior

01:28.880 --> 01:31.049
not up to your standards?

01:31.091 --> 01:32.467
Why don't you
do something?

01:32.509 --> 01:34.677
Aside from hoarding
like a rodent.

01:34.719 --> 01:36.888
It's called rationing.

01:36.930 --> 01:39.307
This is all of the food
and water left by the miners.

01:39.349 --> 01:41.142
We have been
down here for 24 hours

01:41.184 --> 01:42.727
and we have no cell reception.

01:42.769 --> 01:44.354
Don't be melodramatic.

01:44.395 --> 01:46.481
Fallon and Adam
will send out a search party

01:46.523 --> 01:48.274
the moment
they realize I'm gone.

01:48.316 --> 01:51.528
Are you that deluded?
That moment is never coming.

01:51.569 --> 01:53.613
They do not know or care
where you are.

01:53.655 --> 01:55.365
You are their mother
in name only.

01:55.406 --> 01:56.699
Now, if I were
trapped down here

01:56.741 --> 01:58.576
with Blake,
we'd be saved already.

01:58.618 --> 02:00.787
BLAKE:
Alexis is gone,

02:00.829 --> 02:03.498
and gluten is back, people.

02:03.540 --> 02:05.959
Thank God, I was starting
to turn into a kale frittata.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.168
ADAM: Well,
it seems like today

02:07.210 --> 02:09.379
is a day
of Carrington celebrations.

02:09.420 --> 02:12.173
Oh, crap, is it
Fallon's birthday?

02:12.215 --> 02:14.968
It's Adam's first day as
chief of staff at the hospital.

02:15.009 --> 02:16.678
Very exciting,

02:16.719 --> 02:17.887
even if it does
mean he already has

02:17.929 --> 02:19.472
less time for his girlfriend.

02:19.514 --> 02:22.142
That's great news, son.
I'm proud of you.

02:23.560 --> 02:24.769
Blake?

02:24.811 --> 02:26.229
Is everything okay?

02:26.271 --> 02:27.647
Couldn't be better.

02:27.689 --> 02:29.065
I'm back at the head
of the table

02:29.107 --> 02:31.025
with the woman I love
by my side.

02:32.694 --> 02:35.947
I'm just savoring the moment.

02:35.989 --> 02:39.325
FALLON:
Blake, you're late
for our meeting!

02:39.367 --> 02:42.078
Well, it was nice
while it lasted.

02:44.497 --> 02:47.292
Well, I better be going as well.

02:47.333 --> 02:48.835
Got to set a good example.

02:48.877 --> 02:50.920
I'm late for a meeting
at the clinic as well.

02:50.962 --> 02:52.922
(phone chimes, buzzes)

02:57.385 --> 02:59.012
KIRBY:
Do you think it's weird
everyone has a job

02:59.053 --> 03:00.680
they're passionate about but me?

03:00.722 --> 03:02.640
You know
that I'm your boss, right?

03:02.682 --> 03:04.350
But I did take
this aptitude quiz.

03:04.392 --> 03:08.396
It said my true calling in
life is to be a "helper."

03:08.438 --> 03:10.023
Hmm. "Helpers should seek
a career

03:10.064 --> 03:12.442
"that empowers others
by providing advice

03:12.483 --> 03:13.985
or an essential service."

03:14.027 --> 03:18.239
I already help events
get planned. (scoffs)

03:18.281 --> 03:20.658
Well, maybe you're looking at it
from the wrong angle.

03:20.700 --> 03:22.702
Helper can mean a lot of things.

03:24.287 --> 03:25.955
BLAKE:
You got your work
cut out for you.

03:25.997 --> 03:28.625
This is how much the Scottish
castle restoration is costing?

03:28.666 --> 03:31.169
Well, no one said
refurbishing a trebuchet

03:31.211 --> 03:33.463
from 1412 was
gonna be cheap.

03:33.504 --> 03:34.839
But it got us the land.

03:34.881 --> 03:36.549
Maybe, but if you don't start

03:36.591 --> 03:38.259
paying off these loans,
you'll be shuttering

03:38.301 --> 03:40.428
entire divisions before
the end of the fiscal year.

03:40.470 --> 03:42.055
You don't need to tell me
my company's in danger.

03:42.096 --> 03:43.681
Okay? I already know.

03:43.723 --> 03:45.683
But if our IPO is approved,

03:45.725 --> 03:47.352
then it'll all work out.

03:47.393 --> 03:49.354
I mean, I know that
it's a risky move to go public

03:49.395 --> 03:50.813
in order to cover debt, but...

03:50.855 --> 03:52.649
Risky is when I let
the Tesla self-drive

03:52.690 --> 03:53.816
with my eyes closed for fun.

03:53.858 --> 03:55.610
This is way beyond that.

03:55.652 --> 03:59.656
Look, SEC approval for this
usually averages around 25 days,

03:59.697 --> 04:01.074
but I need it
to happen...

04:02.033 --> 04:04.202
...in two.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.955
Okay. Whose palms do
we need to grease?

04:06.996 --> 04:10.458
The palms of my
assigned SEC officer.

04:11.751 --> 04:13.169
Oh, Corinne Simpson.

04:13.211 --> 04:14.837
We used to winter together
in St. Barts.

04:16.005 --> 04:17.340
Nope. I misread.

04:17.382 --> 04:19.175
"Corinne Simon."
Don't know her. Sorry.

04:20.176 --> 04:22.470
LIAM:
Uh, I know Corinne Simon.

04:27.850 --> 04:30.520
How long has he been in here?
He's quiet.

04:30.561 --> 04:32.772
Corinne is an old
Van Kirk family friend.

04:32.814 --> 04:34.691
I'd be happy to make a call
when I take my next break.

04:34.732 --> 04:37.068
(clears throat)
I'm researching a few
potential stories...

04:38.444 --> 04:41.406
Or I can take my break now.

04:43.950 --> 04:46.035
Hey, Mom. Haven't heard
back from you yet.

04:46.077 --> 04:48.162
But I was serious
about talking. Call me.

04:48.204 --> 04:49.998
Hey, man.

04:50.039 --> 04:51.541
What brings you in?

04:51.582 --> 04:54.294
I don't suppose that was Mia
on the phone?

04:54.335 --> 04:56.671
Was it supposed to be?

04:56.713 --> 05:00.550
Remember how I said
I would stand down with Mia?

05:00.591 --> 05:03.761
I did, but then I stood up.

05:03.803 --> 05:05.555
And then we kissed.

05:05.596 --> 05:08.725
Okay, did she send you here
to talk to me or something?

05:08.766 --> 05:10.518
No, but I need to.

05:10.560 --> 05:12.562
Because now she wants
to date the both of us.

05:13.730 --> 05:15.982
I hope I didn't screw up
our friendship.

05:16.983 --> 05:18.985
Relax. If Mia wants

05:19.027 --> 05:21.279
to test-drive two
high-performing cars at once,

05:21.321 --> 05:23.406
I say we let her.

05:23.448 --> 05:25.158
A little friendly competition
never hurt anyone.

05:25.199 --> 05:27.493
Ah. I'm glad you're chill
about this.

05:27.535 --> 05:29.120
That makes me
feel a lot better

05:29.162 --> 05:30.413
about the brunch date I
have with her in a few hours

05:30.455 --> 05:32.582
at L'Etoile.
Oh, I'm super chill with it.

05:32.623 --> 05:34.834
Because I'm seeing her
later tonight for dinner.

05:36.461 --> 05:37.837
So I guess that's game on?

05:39.756 --> 05:41.174
(soft clattering in distance)

05:41.215 --> 05:42.842
BLAKE:
So, you know how you're gonna

05:42.884 --> 05:44.052
play this tonight?

05:44.093 --> 05:46.095
I got this. Somewhere--

05:46.137 --> 05:47.889
after surf,
but well before turf--

05:47.930 --> 05:49.307
I'll just
casually mention

05:49.349 --> 05:50.641
that Fallon Unlimited needs

05:50.683 --> 05:52.518
the review process...
accelerated.

05:52.560 --> 05:54.312
And if we've sufficiently
charmed her,

05:54.354 --> 05:56.189
she'll think it's all her idea,
it'll be smooth sailing.

05:56.230 --> 05:57.607
Mm.
I think you may need

05:57.648 --> 05:59.359
to drop your anchor
for a second.

05:59.400 --> 06:01.402
I just spoke with
some old VKI colleagues.

06:01.444 --> 06:04.072
Turns out Corinne helped
my father take VKI public

06:04.113 --> 06:05.907
back in the day.
And, uh...

06:05.948 --> 06:07.575
this extravaganza's got to go.

06:07.617 --> 06:09.243
What? Why?

06:09.285 --> 06:11.079
Who doesn't like
a little special treatment?

06:11.120 --> 06:13.539
Corinne. Anything even
resembling a bribe

06:13.581 --> 06:15.666
will end this faster
than you can say chowdah.

06:15.708 --> 06:17.668
Well, I would never say that,
fast or slow.

06:17.710 --> 06:19.879
Yeah, who said anything
about a bribe?

06:19.921 --> 06:21.923
This is just a casual
dinner with a woman

06:21.964 --> 06:24.342
who happens to love
New England seafood.
New England seafood.

06:24.384 --> 06:27.136
Trust me, this is
how things are done.

06:27.178 --> 06:29.263
Trust me, my father is
the one who knew her.

06:29.305 --> 06:30.306
But, hey, if you won't
listen to my advice,

06:30.348 --> 06:31.933
I don't need to be here tonight.

06:35.103 --> 06:36.687
Okay, okay, okay. Fine.

06:36.729 --> 06:38.523
We'll eighty-six
the tanks,

06:38.564 --> 06:40.566
and the chefs, the helm.

06:40.608 --> 06:43.986
And, you know, anything that
feels nautical or bribey.

06:44.028 --> 06:45.613
(clears throat)

06:45.655 --> 06:49.075
And, uh, that means
you, too, Blake.

06:49.117 --> 06:50.201
BLAKE:
What?

06:50.243 --> 06:51.869
Why do I have to go?

06:51.911 --> 06:54.789
I mean, Blake Carrington
in the room will smell fishier

06:54.831 --> 06:56.374
than that seafood tower
I just saw wheeled in.

06:56.416 --> 06:57.834
Yeah.

06:57.875 --> 07:00.461
I'm sorry, but...

07:00.503 --> 07:02.755
I trust Liam.

07:02.797 --> 07:04.382
Fine.

07:04.424 --> 07:06.926
Don't come running to me
when things go south.

07:06.968 --> 07:08.344
I'll be getting my
house back in order.

07:08.386 --> 07:11.097
And I am taking
this lobster with me.

07:11.139 --> 07:14.225
Can someone bring me
some melted butter?

07:14.267 --> 07:16.352
♪ ♪

07:23.484 --> 07:26.946
Wait a minute, did you...

07:26.988 --> 07:28.531
CULHANE:
Rent out the entire restaurant

07:28.573 --> 07:30.867
and have them create
a special menu for us?

07:30.908 --> 07:32.326
Guilty as charged.

07:32.368 --> 07:34.537
(chuckles)
I'm flattered.

07:34.579 --> 07:36.164
And relieved.

07:36.205 --> 07:38.166
I was worried no one else in
the city wanted to eat here.

07:38.207 --> 07:40.126
(laughs)

07:40.168 --> 07:41.669
Well, I figured we'd
cut out the noise

07:41.711 --> 07:43.254
and distraction
on our first date,

07:43.296 --> 07:44.505
really get to know
each other.

07:44.547 --> 07:46.132
And I promise

07:46.174 --> 07:48.176
to stop thinking about
our kiss the other night.

07:48.217 --> 07:50.178
Though, if it happens again...

07:50.219 --> 07:53.931
I don't see kissing
anywhere on here.

07:53.973 --> 07:55.975
Oh, that's an off-the-menu item.

07:56.017 --> 07:57.727
Welcome, to the both of you.

07:57.768 --> 08:00.521
This is a 1928 Krug champagne.

08:00.563 --> 08:01.647
Our rarest vintage.

08:01.689 --> 08:03.024
I-I don't think I...

08:03.065 --> 08:04.692
A Mr. Jeff Colby called

08:04.734 --> 08:06.444
to have it sent over.
(chuckles)

08:06.486 --> 08:09.489
That is generous of him,
but I was thinking of something

08:09.530 --> 08:11.532
that pairs better with the menu.

08:11.574 --> 08:12.867
Not a problem.
Mr. Colby purchased

08:12.909 --> 08:14.494
the restaurant's
entire wine cellar

08:14.535 --> 08:16.370
for your enjoyment.

08:16.412 --> 08:19.874
Uh, bit of a waste
for the two of us.

08:19.916 --> 08:21.709
He mentioned anything
you don't use

08:21.751 --> 08:24.170
will be donated to tomorrow's
One City, One Voice dinner.

08:24.212 --> 08:26.797
(chuckles)
I'll get you the wine list.

08:26.839 --> 08:28.299
MIA:
He already offered

08:28.341 --> 08:30.843
to move the auction
to Club Colby for us.

08:32.303 --> 08:34.639
He's in quite a charitable mood.

08:34.680 --> 08:37.225
Yeah, he really is something.

08:38.851 --> 08:40.394
If I'm dying, just tell me.

08:40.436 --> 08:42.438
I can't tell you anything
until we do more tests.

08:42.480 --> 08:44.273
What kind of tests?

08:44.315 --> 08:45.900
Well, to start, an MRI.

08:45.942 --> 08:47.902
You have a
considerable growth

08:47.944 --> 08:50.947
near the nerve leading from
your inner ear to your brain.

08:50.988 --> 08:52.782
Now, if we're lucky,

08:52.823 --> 08:55.076
it's an acoustic neuroma, and
that would explain your vertigo.

08:55.117 --> 08:57.036
That doesn't sound lucky.

08:57.078 --> 08:58.913
It would mean
the tumor was benign.

08:58.955 --> 09:01.707
But we need the scan. I'll call
Neurology to set it up.

09:01.749 --> 09:04.919
Thank you for doing this.

09:04.961 --> 09:06.337
And for not telling Blake.

09:06.379 --> 09:08.673
Of course.

09:08.714 --> 09:10.591
I don't want
to downplay anything.

09:10.633 --> 09:13.010
There's still a long way to go
before you're out of the woods.

09:17.932 --> 09:20.351
I have to admit, the lack of
frills tonight was refreshing.

09:20.393 --> 09:22.103
Well, this is how we eat
most nights.

09:22.144 --> 09:23.187
You know? Frill-less.

09:23.229 --> 09:24.647
Well, you wouldn't believe

09:24.689 --> 09:26.274
what some CEO-types
try to ply me with.

09:26.315 --> 09:27.358
Fancy seafood?

09:27.400 --> 09:28.943
Pricey vintages
of champagne?

09:28.985 --> 09:29.944
Live lobster?

09:29.986 --> 09:30.987
Point made, darling.

09:31.028 --> 09:32.822
And more.
Which is why

09:32.863 --> 09:35.575
it's been so pleasant to just
catch up with an old friend.

09:35.616 --> 09:38.828
Well, now that we're
all old friends,

09:38.869 --> 09:42.039
I do have a tiny,
little request to run by you.

09:42.081 --> 09:44.125
Of course, I don't want
to cross any lines, but...

09:44.166 --> 09:46.544
I assume you want my help
moving along your SEC review?

09:46.586 --> 09:48.796
Okay, you didn't tell me your
friend was a mind reader, Liam.

09:48.838 --> 09:50.798
(stammers)
I saw your prospectus

09:50.840 --> 09:52.675
come through this morning.
It's just impeccable.

09:52.717 --> 09:53.843
So it's a yes, then.

09:53.884 --> 09:55.303
No.

09:55.344 --> 09:56.554
I can't get to it

09:56.596 --> 09:57.638
for at least two months.

09:57.680 --> 09:58.806
My dance card is quite packed

09:58.848 --> 10:00.725
with companies
these days.

10:00.766 --> 10:02.852
But their applications can't be
as good as mine, right?

10:02.893 --> 10:04.687
I mean, you said "impeccable."

10:04.729 --> 10:06.230
No, they're not.

10:06.272 --> 10:07.732
Especially not the one
I'm working on right now.

10:07.773 --> 10:09.817
Ooh. It's a tech company, I bet?

10:09.859 --> 10:11.736
Millennials are the laziest.

10:11.777 --> 10:15.573
More infomercial than anything,
but... I can't talk about it.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.783
Oh. Okay, okay, I understand.

10:17.825 --> 10:20.786
So Corinne, when was the
last time we saw each other?

10:20.828 --> 10:23.456
I know exactly when it was.

10:23.497 --> 10:25.166
Your 18th birthday.

10:26.250 --> 10:27.877
Oh, right.

10:27.918 --> 10:30.296
My mother had too much
Chardonnay and fell in the pool.

10:30.338 --> 10:33.549
(chuckles)
Laura was in fine form.

10:33.591 --> 10:36.260
But I remember that day
as the last time I saw

10:36.302 --> 10:38.971
your father in good spirits,
despite everything.

10:39.013 --> 10:42.058
W-What do you mean,
"despite everything"?

10:43.100 --> 10:44.769
You know, uh,

10:44.810 --> 10:47.605
everything going on
with the tankers.

10:47.647 --> 10:50.024
I'm not sure your time line
makes sense.

10:50.066 --> 10:52.443
Maybe we should just drop it.

10:55.738 --> 10:57.948
These granola bars
are riddled with gluten.

10:57.990 --> 11:00.618
Fine. Save them for me, then,
and help.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.161
I'm a little tired.

11:02.203 --> 11:04.872
You seem to know everything.
You got this.

11:04.914 --> 11:07.041
So you're still mad at me
for what I said about your kids?

11:07.083 --> 11:08.584
Get over it.

11:08.626 --> 11:11.295
Oh, the words of a failed
nightclub singer like you

11:11.337 --> 11:13.589
don't have an effect on me.

11:13.631 --> 11:17.385
Especially when we all know
who the worse mother is.

11:17.426 --> 11:21.097
Please. I know I'm not perfect,
but unlike you,

11:21.138 --> 11:24.225
I can accept the place
I'm at with my children.

11:24.266 --> 11:25.726
The place
where they don't like you?

11:25.768 --> 11:27.937
If that's a reality
you accept,

11:27.978 --> 11:29.522
you're even sadder
than I thought.

11:29.563 --> 11:32.191
The reality

11:32.233 --> 11:34.819
is that none of our kids
care enough to find us.

11:34.860 --> 11:37.071
It's just you and me.

11:37.113 --> 11:39.198
So I'll say it one more time:

11:39.240 --> 11:42.535
get your child-neglecting ass
over here and move a rock.

11:44.453 --> 11:48.249
Okay, well, thanks
to Corinne's clues,

11:48.290 --> 11:50.835
I was able to scour
the SEC's time line

11:50.876 --> 11:53.713
and as soon as I buy out a
company called Spartan Shakes,

11:53.754 --> 11:55.297
a spot will open up,

11:55.339 --> 11:57.258
which is, uh...

11:57.299 --> 12:00.052
Clearly you're paying
no attention to me.

12:00.094 --> 12:02.346
On my 18th birthday,
a VKI tanker broke down,

12:02.388 --> 12:04.181
and my father
only told four people.

12:04.223 --> 12:06.100
Now, we were all
sworn to secrecy

12:06.142 --> 12:09.061
so VKI could take the week
to strategize.

12:09.103 --> 12:11.063
So as far as the world knew,
it happened a week later,

12:11.105 --> 12:12.732
on this date.

12:12.773 --> 12:14.942
I feel like this has nothing
to do with my IPO launch.

12:14.984 --> 12:17.820
Before the story broke,
a ton of stock was unloaded.

12:17.862 --> 12:19.739
People had clearly
been tipped off,

12:19.780 --> 12:22.032
and my father was accused
of insider trading,

12:22.074 --> 12:23.659
a charge he denied
until the day he died.

12:23.701 --> 12:25.244
Well, is it that crazy to think

12:25.286 --> 12:27.288
that a man who impregnated
his son's girlfriend

12:27.329 --> 12:29.457
also dabbled
in illegal stock trading?

12:29.498 --> 12:31.876
But if Corinne knew
on my 18th birthday,

12:31.917 --> 12:33.961
she might've been the one
tipping people off.

12:34.003 --> 12:35.171
I need to talk to her.

12:35.212 --> 12:37.339
No. No, no, no, no.

12:37.381 --> 12:39.633
That's exactly what you
need not to do.

12:39.675 --> 12:41.552
I need Corinne's approval, okay?

12:41.594 --> 12:44.680
And if you start to scare her,
then my IPO is DOA.

12:44.722 --> 12:47.266
But Fallon, this could
exonerate my father.

12:47.308 --> 12:49.810
Who? The man who's been dead
for years? I think he can wait.

12:51.729 --> 12:53.773
Resting peacefully, of course.

12:53.814 --> 12:54.982
Hey.

12:55.024 --> 12:56.317
Promise me

12:56.358 --> 12:57.902
that you will not
reach out to Corinne

12:57.943 --> 13:00.821
until after the SEC paperwork's
cleared.

13:04.325 --> 13:05.618
Fine.

13:06.827 --> 13:08.621
I promise.

13:17.630 --> 13:19.215
So, what do you think?

13:19.256 --> 13:21.425
Do the tannins
taste different up here?

13:23.344 --> 13:25.888
Neither of us actually knows
what tannins are, right?

13:25.930 --> 13:28.265
Not really.
(both laugh)

13:28.307 --> 13:31.352
But you've always been the
classy one in this operation.

13:31.393 --> 13:36.065
(sighs) Jeff,
this is really lovely,

13:36.106 --> 13:39.151
but why a hot-air balloon?

13:39.193 --> 13:41.779
Ouch. Okay.

13:41.821 --> 13:44.031
You really don't
remember our first date?

13:44.073 --> 13:45.825
What, like,
our first first date?

13:45.866 --> 13:49.453
You told me that you had a dream
to look down on every state

13:49.495 --> 13:51.080
from a hot-air balloon.

13:51.121 --> 13:53.791
I don't remember saying that.

13:53.833 --> 13:55.543
But it's sweet you did.

13:56.961 --> 13:58.379
(phone chimes, buzzes)

13:58.420 --> 14:00.756
Well, you make being
a good listener pretty easy.

14:09.098 --> 14:11.809
Wow.
(laughs)

14:12.977 --> 14:14.270
(phone chimes, buzzes)

14:17.356 --> 14:19.859
"Look west, and enjoy the show.

14:21.068 --> 14:22.403
"Have a great time tonight.

14:22.444 --> 14:25.072
Love and lights, Michael."

14:26.782 --> 14:30.619
Looks like Mr. Culhane is paying
you back for the wine cellar.

14:30.661 --> 14:33.622
Yeah. Guess so.
(chuckles)

14:33.664 --> 14:35.749
What a guy.

14:36.834 --> 14:39.086
So, how's the bartending going?

14:39.128 --> 14:40.671
Have we found your calling?

14:40.713 --> 14:43.299
If I have to listen
to one more sob story,

14:43.340 --> 14:46.594
I'm going to stick
a maraschino cherry in my eye.

14:46.635 --> 14:47.636
I think I just
need to accept

14:47.678 --> 14:49.763
that my boyfriend is boring,

14:49.805 --> 14:51.181
my job is boring,

14:51.223 --> 14:52.474
and I am,

14:52.516 --> 14:55.102
by association... Oliver?

14:55.144 --> 14:56.896
SAM: Who?
My ex,

14:56.937 --> 14:58.772
from back in Australia.

14:58.814 --> 15:01.400
Well, if he looked like that
when you broke up with him,

15:01.442 --> 15:02.776
then shame on you, honey.

15:02.818 --> 15:04.904
Cover for me? Thanks.

15:09.033 --> 15:10.910
Oliver.

15:10.951 --> 15:12.453
What are you doing here?

15:12.494 --> 15:13.787
Kirby Anders?

15:13.829 --> 15:15.289
Is that really you?

15:15.331 --> 15:17.750
Or is this hotel
called La Mirage for a reason?

15:17.791 --> 15:19.251
How about you answer
my question?

15:19.293 --> 15:20.377
'Cause I'm kind of
freaking out right now.

15:20.419 --> 15:22.296
I'm here for a photography gig.

15:22.338 --> 15:23.589
I can't believe this.

15:23.631 --> 15:25.049
You look...

15:26.008 --> 15:27.384
You do, too.

15:27.426 --> 15:28.969
We're complimenting
each other, right?

15:29.011 --> 15:30.554
(laughs softly)

15:30.596 --> 15:32.681
You've really cleaned up a lot.

15:32.723 --> 15:34.642
At least, on the outside.

15:34.683 --> 15:36.602
Inside, too, I hope.

15:36.644 --> 15:39.438
Maybe you can see for
yourself over dinner?

15:39.480 --> 15:41.273
I have a boyfriend.

15:41.315 --> 15:43.150
And he doesn't allow you to eat?

15:43.192 --> 15:45.527
Fine, forget about dinner.

15:45.569 --> 15:47.446
But I won't let this
serendipity go to waste.

15:47.488 --> 15:49.198
How about you come by the
photo shoot tomorrow morning?

15:50.866 --> 15:52.368
Okay. That sounds safe.

15:52.409 --> 15:55.663
I mean, it's not like
I have much else going on.

15:55.704 --> 15:57.206
(laughs softly)

16:00.209 --> 16:02.461
This woman saved every piece
of paper she's ever had.

16:02.503 --> 16:04.046
Should you be rifling
through that?

16:04.088 --> 16:06.173
Oh, no, this is gonna be good.
It says "Manor."

16:06.215 --> 16:09.093
Oh, probably all her decorating
ideas she never got around to.

16:09.134 --> 16:10.761
There's a lot of that,
some notes

16:10.803 --> 16:12.596
about calling lawyers
to countersue.

16:15.724 --> 16:20.854
Receipt for a wire transfer
to Adam for $200,000?

16:20.896 --> 16:22.564
It's a forwarding
address.

16:22.606 --> 16:25.067
To the same town where
we had our refinery explosion.

16:25.109 --> 16:26.443
Well, that could mean anything.

16:26.485 --> 16:27.736
No, it means one thing.

16:27.778 --> 16:29.113
It means that Adam
fronted the money

16:29.154 --> 16:30.489
to some local
for the attack on C.A.

16:31.740 --> 16:32.700
Which means that Adam
played a key role

16:32.741 --> 16:33.701
in destroying my life.

16:33.742 --> 16:35.452
(shouts)

16:35.494 --> 16:38.497
Betrayal and hurt
are valid emotions.

16:38.539 --> 16:40.082
In fact, it's probably
what Adam felt

16:40.124 --> 16:42.459
when you almost
left him for dead in Moldavia.

16:42.501 --> 16:44.086
Are you telling me
I deserved this?

16:44.128 --> 16:46.213
No, no, it's just
that you've fought so hard

16:46.255 --> 16:47.798
to get back to where you are.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.675
You don't want to throw it away
in a fit of rage.

16:52.428 --> 16:54.555
(camera shutter clicking)

16:54.596 --> 16:55.973
We need to move on
to the next look.

16:56.015 --> 16:58.434
Can someone get me
an ETA on Mirabella?

16:58.475 --> 17:01.270
I never really thought
you'd make it as a professional.

17:01.311 --> 17:03.188
Mostly because
you were always high.

17:03.230 --> 17:05.941
Ouch. But fair.

17:05.983 --> 17:09.570
Until yesterday, I wasn't
even sure if you were alive.

17:09.611 --> 17:12.531
I think the last time
I saw you was...

17:14.450 --> 17:16.702
...when I left you
on the steps at the ER.

17:19.329 --> 17:20.789
I should've stayed.

17:20.831 --> 17:22.666
No, absolutely not.

17:22.708 --> 17:24.501
You were right to leave.

17:24.543 --> 17:28.464
What we had was fun, but I took
you down a dangerous path.

17:30.424 --> 17:32.634
You skipping town
was the wake-up call I needed.

17:32.676 --> 17:34.553
I checked myself into rehab
the next day.

17:34.595 --> 17:38.682
It seems like you've really made
something of yourself.

17:40.100 --> 17:41.769
It's very impressive.

17:43.020 --> 17:45.689
Mm. Kind of inspiring.

17:45.731 --> 17:48.275
Mirabella's out.
She broke up with her boyfriend,

17:48.317 --> 17:50.027
shaved her head, now the entire
show's palette is off.

17:50.069 --> 17:52.780
And who is she and who reps her?

17:53.781 --> 17:55.365
Oh, this is my friend Kirby.

17:55.407 --> 17:58.077
Perfect. We need a redhead.

17:58.118 --> 18:01.413
Oh. Uh, I'm-I'm not a model.

18:01.455 --> 18:03.165
And I'm really more of
a strawberry blonde.

18:03.207 --> 18:06.043
Weren't you just telling me
that you're bored at work?

18:06.085 --> 18:08.003
You'd actually be
doing us a favor.

18:11.298 --> 18:12.758
(footsteps approaching)

18:14.718 --> 18:16.095
Oh...

18:16.136 --> 18:18.472
Corinne!
What a nice surprise.

18:18.514 --> 18:21.850
Hi, Fallon. I just came
to give you the good news

18:21.892 --> 18:24.144
that Spartan Shakes,
the company impeding

18:24.186 --> 18:25.854
your approval,
withdrew from the calendar.

18:26.814 --> 18:28.023
That's unbelievable.

18:28.065 --> 18:29.483
What's unbelievable is Liam

18:29.525 --> 18:31.735
investigating
my supposed misconduct

18:31.777 --> 18:33.070
at the SEC.

18:33.112 --> 18:34.613
Liam?

18:34.655 --> 18:36.490
Well, that sounds
like a mistake.

18:36.532 --> 18:38.283
I hope so.
Otherwise you'll be waiting

18:38.325 --> 18:40.035
a long time
to get on my calendar.

18:41.537 --> 18:43.956
Get him to drop it.

18:52.589 --> 18:54.508
Uh, thank you so much
for the opportunity, Jordanna.

18:54.550 --> 18:56.552
Uh-- No, you have a good day.
(gasps)

18:56.593 --> 18:59.138
Didn't get it?
They want me back
for the rest of the shoot.

18:59.179 --> 19:01.515
Well, I guess that quiz was
wrong about you being a helper.

19:01.557 --> 19:03.350
Well, no, I'm gonna
help the world realize

19:03.392 --> 19:05.352
how fantastic I look
in designer clothing.

19:05.394 --> 19:06.770
(gasps)
Wait, I need to text Oliver.

19:06.812 --> 19:08.772
Hold on.

19:08.814 --> 19:10.149
Is he gonna be the photographer
the whole time?

19:10.190 --> 19:12.025
Yeah, but it's not a big deal.

19:12.067 --> 19:13.986
Look, take it from me.

19:14.027 --> 19:15.863
It can be confusing
and heart-wrenching

19:15.904 --> 19:17.197
to work with an ex.

19:17.239 --> 19:18.782
You think you can
be professional,

19:18.824 --> 19:22.619
and then the light hits
in just the right way,

19:22.661 --> 19:23.912
and then it's too late.

19:23.954 --> 19:26.665
Oh, my God.
You slept with Fletcher.

19:26.707 --> 19:27.958
Of course I did.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.502
And I feel awful
about it, okay?

19:30.544 --> 19:32.254
I keep avoiding Fletcher,
I keep avoiding Ryan,

19:32.296 --> 19:35.465
I can't even look
in the mirror. It's terrible.

19:35.507 --> 19:37.301
Oh, I'm sorry you're going
through that, Sammy Jo,

19:37.342 --> 19:39.428
but I'm gonna be fine,
I promise. Okay?

19:39.469 --> 19:41.388
Adam and I are purely platonic.

19:42.472 --> 19:44.516
(gasps)
Oliver.

19:44.558 --> 19:47.019
I mean, Oliver and I.
(chuckles)

19:47.060 --> 19:50.689
Yeah. That's not
concerning at all.

19:52.107 --> 19:53.901
So, when's lunch getting here?

19:53.942 --> 19:55.527
I'm kind of hungry.

19:55.569 --> 19:57.362
Soon.

19:57.404 --> 20:00.616
In the meantime, how's your
search for a new story coming?

20:01.909 --> 20:03.076
Pretty good...

20:03.118 --> 20:04.661
Lies.

20:04.703 --> 20:06.830
I know
you're investigating Corinne.

20:06.872 --> 20:08.832
There's not gonna be
any lunch, is there?

20:08.874 --> 20:12.169
Lunch is only for well-behaved
husbands who follow orders.

20:12.211 --> 20:13.921
So, what,
now you're General Fallon?

20:13.962 --> 20:15.380
I have to do
exactly as you say

20:15.422 --> 20:17.132
and salute every time I see you?

20:18.467 --> 20:19.927
That's not gonna happen.

20:19.968 --> 20:21.887
This is a real story, Fallon.

20:21.929 --> 20:25.265
I'm meeting with a former
VKI colleague of my dad's

20:25.307 --> 20:27.017
who's behind bars
for insider trading.

20:27.059 --> 20:29.061
I don't know,
maybe he was set up, too.

20:29.102 --> 20:31.146
And what is this loser's name?

20:31.188 --> 20:32.773
You don't know him.
His name's Harold.

20:32.814 --> 20:34.399
And technically,

20:34.441 --> 20:36.068
I did just as you asked.

20:36.109 --> 20:37.402
I didn't reach out to Corinne.

20:37.444 --> 20:39.655
Oh, really, Liam?
A loophole defense?

20:39.696 --> 20:41.031
Obviously Corinne

20:41.073 --> 20:42.407
was going to find out,
which she did,

20:42.449 --> 20:43.700
and threaten
to hold up my approval,

20:43.742 --> 20:45.535
which she also did.

20:45.577 --> 20:47.371
Wait, wait, wait. Corinne's
holding your approval hostage?

20:47.412 --> 20:48.705
I mean, Fallon, right there,

20:48.747 --> 20:50.457
that's basically
an admission of guilt.

20:50.499 --> 20:52.251
I don't care if she admitted
to shooting Lincoln, Liam.

20:52.292 --> 20:54.753
I need her stamp of approval
to move forward.

20:54.795 --> 20:58.799
I mean, do you have any idea
what I have riding on this?

20:58.840 --> 21:00.217
(chuckles)

21:00.259 --> 21:02.219
We're supposed to be a team.

21:02.261 --> 21:04.137
No, no, no, no, no..
If we were a team,

21:04.179 --> 21:06.598
you wouldn't ask me
to sacrifice something

21:06.640 --> 21:09.101
you know I have
a personal stake in.

21:09.142 --> 21:12.187
I know you make more money
than I do,

21:12.229 --> 21:14.523
but my goals aren't
any less important than yours.

21:17.985 --> 21:19.569
Actually...

21:19.611 --> 21:21.196
this time they are
less important.

21:21.238 --> 21:22.990
And that's just something you're
gonna have to deal with.

21:23.031 --> 21:25.200
No. I don't think it is.

21:25.242 --> 21:28.495
I need to find the truth out
about my father.

21:30.580 --> 21:33.208
And I hope you'll find
a way to support me.

21:39.256 --> 21:41.967
Hey, Mom, it's me again.

21:42.009 --> 21:44.261
It's clear you're ignoring me
for whatever reason,

21:44.303 --> 21:46.471
so I'm gonna respect
your wishes.

21:46.513 --> 21:49.182
I won't be calling anymore.

21:50.434 --> 21:52.102
Well, well, well.

21:52.144 --> 21:53.979
If it isn't the wine king.

21:54.021 --> 21:55.814
(chuckles)
Thank you for that.

21:55.856 --> 21:57.649
No, thank you
for those fireworks.

21:57.691 --> 21:59.943
I mean, it really brightened
up a date that was...

21:59.985 --> 22:01.611
already pretty hot.

22:02.904 --> 22:04.740
This is gonna get awkward
pretty soon.

22:04.781 --> 22:06.491
One of us should
probably bow out.

22:09.536 --> 22:12.414
Hmm, or maybe when
this event is done,

22:12.456 --> 22:13.832
we can just let Mia decide.

22:13.874 --> 22:15.625
Sounds like a plan to me.

22:15.667 --> 22:17.586
As long as there's no jockeying
for position here.

22:17.627 --> 22:19.671
Truce tonight?

22:19.713 --> 22:21.631
You got it.

22:21.673 --> 22:23.592
I'm gonna go check out
the silent auction.

22:23.633 --> 22:26.303
Mia mentioned it was important
for tonight's success.

22:26.345 --> 22:28.430
So...

22:35.771 --> 22:37.439
I don't do this often.

22:37.481 --> 22:39.691
So you'd better
cherish the moment.

22:39.733 --> 22:42.611
I'm sorry for causing
the cave-in.

22:42.652 --> 22:44.279
It's not your fault.

22:44.321 --> 22:46.156
We're both being punished
for our sins.

22:46.198 --> 22:47.657
(chuckles)

22:47.699 --> 22:49.117
You want to talk about sins?

22:49.159 --> 22:51.244
Honey, mine could run laps
around yours.

22:51.286 --> 22:52.954
I seriously doubt that.

22:52.996 --> 22:55.207
You are talking to the woman
who purposefully

22:55.248 --> 22:57.501
gave food poisoning to Ashanti.

22:57.542 --> 23:00.253
I flew Kirby's ex-boyfriend here
all the way from Australia

23:00.295 --> 23:02.798
so he could break up
her relationship with my son.

23:02.839 --> 23:04.758
Which is hopefully
happening right now.

23:04.800 --> 23:07.177
I slept
with my stepdaughter's boyfriend

23:07.219 --> 23:10.472
for the publicity
of a love triangle scandal.

23:10.514 --> 23:12.307
I hired a man to cut off
his finger and pretend

23:12.349 --> 23:14.434
to be my long-lost
kidnapped son.

23:14.476 --> 23:16.561
Severed finger, you win.

23:16.603 --> 23:18.271
Mm.

23:18.313 --> 23:19.856
Wait.

23:19.898 --> 23:22.192
You slept with Michael Culhane?

23:22.234 --> 23:23.944
Indeed.

23:23.985 --> 23:25.779
Oh! (laughs)

23:25.821 --> 23:27.823
Good for you.
It was.

23:27.864 --> 23:30.450
(both laugh)

23:32.994 --> 23:35.580
I lied yesterday.

23:35.622 --> 23:38.417
I'm not at peace
in my relationship with Jeff.

23:39.960 --> 23:42.003
Not by a long shot.

23:43.672 --> 23:47.342
And I know that I've done a lot
of harm to Fallon and Adam.

23:48.301 --> 23:51.012
Neglect and manipulation
of our children.

23:52.389 --> 23:54.766
That's the sin we're paying for.

23:55.892 --> 23:57.561
(Fitbit chiming)

23:57.602 --> 23:59.187
Great.

23:59.229 --> 24:01.273
My heartrate is slowing.

24:02.816 --> 24:04.985
We're probably
running out of air.

24:06.111 --> 24:08.029
Well...

24:08.071 --> 24:11.908
I hope the champagne in hell
isn't too burned.

24:14.161 --> 24:17.038
ADAM:
The mass is a stage-four

24:17.080 --> 24:19.166
glioblastoma.

24:19.207 --> 24:20.667
Well...

24:20.709 --> 24:22.586
what are my options?

24:22.627 --> 24:24.921
Given the proximity
of the tumor

24:24.963 --> 24:27.215
to the brain stem, I...

24:27.257 --> 24:29.134
I don't think
it's operable.

24:29.176 --> 24:31.386
I'm so sorry.

24:31.428 --> 24:34.514
So if I try to have surgery,

24:34.556 --> 24:37.309
I die?

24:37.350 --> 24:40.228
And if I don't... I die?

24:40.270 --> 24:43.148
We're gonna get
the best oncologists

24:43.190 --> 24:45.400
and the best neurologists
in the world on this.

24:45.442 --> 24:47.444
If there's a way out of this,
we're gonna find it.

24:47.486 --> 24:49.279
But we probably won't.

24:49.321 --> 24:51.948
So what do I do now?

24:53.116 --> 24:55.952
I think the time has come for
you to tell the people you love.

24:57.913 --> 24:59.581
Starting with Blake.

25:11.551 --> 25:14.554
Okay, y'all. It's the moment
you've been waiting for.

25:14.596 --> 25:17.307
The silent auction is closed,
and I have the winning bids

25:17.349 --> 25:19.976
listed right here.
(applause)

25:22.020 --> 25:23.730
Let's start big.

25:23.772 --> 25:26.816
The all-expenses-paid trip
to Paris for two.

25:26.858 --> 25:28.151
Ooh là là.
(chuckling)

25:28.193 --> 25:29.444
And the winner is...

25:31.112 --> 25:32.906
...one of tonight's sponsors,
Michael Culhane.

25:32.948 --> 25:35.492
(applause)
A double thank you
to him.

25:35.534 --> 25:37.452
On to another big item.

25:37.494 --> 25:40.956
The beautiful
XSR48 powerboat.

25:40.997 --> 25:42.249
And this one goes to...

25:42.290 --> 25:43.416
(chuckles)

25:43.458 --> 25:45.794
...the very generous owner

25:45.835 --> 25:46.795
of tonight's venue,

25:46.836 --> 25:50.298
Jeff Colby.
(applause)

25:51.550 --> 25:53.176
Clocks in a little higher
than your weekend getaway, huh?

25:53.218 --> 25:54.177
I'm not worried.

25:54.219 --> 25:56.012
(chuckles softly)

25:56.054 --> 25:58.515
And the private dinner for 12
goes to Michael Culhane.

25:58.557 --> 25:59.766
Again.

25:59.808 --> 26:02.644
(applause)

26:03.603 --> 26:05.063
One moment, please.

26:10.986 --> 26:12.487
I have to apologize.

26:12.529 --> 26:14.114
Seems that there may have been
a malfunction

26:14.155 --> 26:15.156
in the bidding process.

26:15.198 --> 26:17.659
(murmuring)

26:17.701 --> 26:19.369
♪ ♪

26:23.498 --> 26:25.584
(footsteps approaching)

26:28.962 --> 26:31.381
JENNINGS:
Drinking while
distantly staring into the fire.

26:32.340 --> 26:33.717
Not a good sign.

26:33.758 --> 26:35.552
Well, such is the custom

26:35.594 --> 26:37.137
when you've spent
the afternoon in jail

26:37.178 --> 26:40.223
blackmailing a
felon into silence.

26:40.265 --> 26:42.225
It hasn't been the best day.

26:42.267 --> 26:44.227
What's that?
Did you get Blake

26:44.269 --> 26:45.812
a "welcome back to
the manor" present?

26:45.854 --> 26:47.939
I'm sure he would love
another portrait of himself.

26:48.898 --> 26:50.025
It's actually for you.

26:50.066 --> 26:52.485
It was gonna be
your wedding gift,

26:52.527 --> 26:54.654
but that day didn't go
quite as planned.

26:54.696 --> 26:57.407
Then I was gonna give it to you
for your anniversary,

26:57.449 --> 26:58.992
but...

26:59.034 --> 27:00.243
why wait?

27:01.620 --> 27:02.579
Oh.

27:02.621 --> 27:04.289
My wedding invitation.

27:04.331 --> 27:07.167
People always remember
to frame their wedding photos,

27:07.208 --> 27:09.586
but... sometimes
it's the little things

27:09.628 --> 27:10.920
that feel the most special.

27:12.422 --> 27:14.257
You and Blake seem good.

27:15.216 --> 27:16.509
We are.

27:16.551 --> 27:17.510
Great, actually.

27:17.552 --> 27:19.220
Losing C.A.

27:19.262 --> 27:21.181
might have been bad for him,
but it was good for us.

27:21.222 --> 27:24.184
He finally treats me
like an equal,

27:24.225 --> 27:26.436
which is all I ever wanted.

27:26.478 --> 27:28.063
Right.

27:28.104 --> 27:29.814
I mean, after all,

27:29.856 --> 27:32.567
marriage is a partnership.
(exhales)

27:32.609 --> 27:35.195
Anyway, I'm sorry
it was such a hellacious road

27:35.236 --> 27:36.446
for you to get there.

27:36.488 --> 27:38.198
Me, too.

27:38.239 --> 27:40.825
I wish we hadn't wasted
all that time.

27:42.285 --> 27:43.995
Such a precious thing.

27:48.083 --> 27:49.334
(indistinct chatter)

27:49.376 --> 27:50.669
Thanks for
celebrating with me,

27:50.710 --> 27:52.212
but I should probably
call it a night.

27:52.253 --> 27:54.130
I promised Adam I'd be
home when he got back.

27:55.090 --> 27:56.675
Oh, I didn't realize
you'd gotten married.

27:56.716 --> 27:58.760
And were living
in the 1950s.

27:58.802 --> 28:00.053
You gonna make him
a nice pot roast

28:00.095 --> 28:01.680
when you
get back, too?

28:01.721 --> 28:04.015
Come on. Stay out
a little bit longer.

28:04.057 --> 28:07.268
Or are you really so determined
to be that boring?

28:08.853 --> 28:09.813
Fine.

28:09.854 --> 28:11.272
But if I stay out,

28:11.314 --> 28:12.857
I'm gonna need shots,
if that's okay.

28:12.899 --> 28:15.485
Of course. I mean,
I don't drink, but I'm no saint.

28:17.028 --> 28:20.073
If you're gonna hit the hard
stuff, I think I might...

28:21.074 --> 28:22.826
Actually, don't worry about it.

28:22.867 --> 28:23.827
I'll be back.

28:23.868 --> 28:25.203
Where are you going

28:25.245 --> 28:26.955
and why are you being
so mysterious?

28:28.039 --> 28:29.833
Look, it's not a big deal.

28:29.874 --> 28:33.837
I'm just going to the bathroom
for a quick bump of, um...

28:33.878 --> 28:35.463
energy.

the help.

28:46.599 --> 28:48.143

to tempt you with it

28:48.184 --> 28:49.769

less adventurous place,

the auction?

Yes. Second highest
bidder wins the item.

We agree.

39:17.605 --> 39:20.399
Oh. Um, just some files
from the clinic.

39:20.441 --> 39:21.609
Nothing important.

39:23.277 --> 39:25.404
I thought maybe...

39:25.446 --> 39:26.906
we could hit the hot tub.

39:26.947 --> 39:30.576
The one at La Mirage
didn't have great jets and...

39:30.618 --> 39:32.203
wasn't in our bedroom.

39:32.244 --> 39:34.705
I would like nothing more.

LIAM:
Back to work on the IPO.

39:42.213 --> 39:43.339
Congratulations.

39:43.381 --> 39:44.465
Thank you.

39:45.174 --> 39:48.219
But I'm not thrilled with
what it took to get there.

39:48.260 --> 39:49.970
Or how I treated you.

39:50.930 --> 39:51.972
It's okay.
I forgive you.

39:52.014 --> 39:53.766
And, luckily,

39:53.808 --> 39:55.726
I don't see our careers going
head-to-head again like that

39:55.768 --> 39:57.144
anytime soon.

39:57.186 --> 39:58.813
Though if they do,

39:58.854 --> 40:00.564
then we'll figure out a way
to support each other.

40:03.484 --> 40:05.653
How are you holding up?

40:05.694 --> 40:08.239
I know you don't like talking
about your dad's death.

40:08.280 --> 40:10.658
Yeah.

40:10.699 --> 40:12.576
I guess I was just ashamed.

40:14.328 --> 40:17.915
He drowned in a lake
after falling off his boat.

40:19.125 --> 40:22.628
Cops found six empty bottles
of scotch in the cabin.

40:24.296 --> 40:26.966
There was nothing suspicious
about it.

40:28.175 --> 40:29.885
Yeah, it was just, uh...

40:29.927 --> 40:32.513
Well, it was
shocking, I'm sure.

40:32.555 --> 40:34.598
It was pathetic.
(chuckles softly)

40:35.766 --> 40:37.518

40:38.769 --> 40:40.771
If Corinne is right...
(inhales)

40:40.813 --> 40:43.774
...if my dad was murdered,
I need to find out the truth.

40:43.816 --> 40:45.443
Okay.

40:45.484 --> 40:46.944
But you heard her.

40:46.986 --> 40:48.612
Those are dangerous people,

40:48.654 --> 40:49.780

Which is why...

40:51.449 --> 40:52.575
I have to go.

40:52.616 --> 40:54.034
I've already tracked down
a lead

40:54.076 --> 40:55.870
who can get me closer
to the truth.

40:56.829 --> 40:58.289
Corinne's former boss.

40:58.330 --> 40:59.748
He works at a corporate
think tank in Washington.

40:59.790 --> 41:01.542
Liam,

41:01.584 --> 41:03.461
listen to me, okay?

41:03.502 --> 41:06.046
This is not worth the risk
of getting hurt.

41:06.088 --> 41:07.298
Yeah, but it is.

41:07.339 --> 41:08.924
If my father
was murdered,

41:08.966 --> 41:11.135
then maybe he wasn't just
some drunk that I barely knew.

41:12.803 --> 41:15.764
He can be my dad again,
