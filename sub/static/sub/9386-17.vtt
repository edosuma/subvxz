WEBVTT

00:01.543 --> 00:04.463
It seems today
that all you see

00:04.546 --> 00:07.758
Is violence in movies
and sex on TV

00:07.841 --> 00:11.762
But where are those
good old-fashioned values

00:11.845 --> 00:14.890
On which we used to rely?

00:14.973 --> 00:17.768
Lucky there's a Family Guy

00:17.851 --> 00:21.647
Lucky there's a man who
positively can do

00:21.730 --> 00:23.273
All the things
that make us

00:23.357 --> 00:24.650
Laugh and cry

00:24.733 --> 00:29.905
He's... a...
Fam...ily... Guy

00:33.867 --> 00:36.828
Peter, don't forget
you have a physical today at 1:00.

00:36.912 --> 00:39.164
For the hundredth time, Lois,
I won't forget.

00:39.248 --> 00:40.624
Nag, nag, nag.

00:40.707 --> 00:42.626
Sometimes I think
I should have married that woman

00:42.709 --> 00:45.254
I met the night
of my bachelor party.

00:45.337 --> 00:48.173
Peter, I can't believe
your friends just left you here.

00:48.257 --> 00:49.299
Let's get you home.

00:49.383 --> 00:52.636
Wow, strange lady.
You're so sexy.

00:52.719 --> 00:56.640
I should marry you tomorrow
instead of that pain-in-the-ass Lois.

00:56.765 --> 00:57.766
Peter, it's me.

00:57.850 --> 00:58.851
You know what? Screw it.

00:58.934 --> 01:01.311
I am so gonna cheat
on Lois right now.

01:01.395 --> 01:03.522
-I don't care if she finds out.
-Peter...

01:03.605 --> 01:06.859
You got a condom? Never mind.
I got this Milky Way wrapper.

01:10.320 --> 01:11.905
Put this on.
Why?

01:11.989 --> 01:14.575
Because I'm skipping my physical
to go have steaks with the guys

01:14.658 --> 01:16.159
and I don't want Lois
to know about it.

01:16.243 --> 01:18.495
Um, okay.

01:18.579 --> 01:21.790
Lois, I'm going to
my physical now.

01:21.874 --> 01:24.001
Okay, honey.
I'll see you later.

01:25.294 --> 01:26.587
Um...

01:27.504 --> 01:29.339
What the hell?
I'll just ask it.

01:29.423 --> 01:31.550
Why did we need
the horse suit for that?

01:37.431 --> 01:40.058
Okay, all right,
that's...

01:40.142 --> 01:42.477
that's seven
16-ounce steaks.

01:42.561 --> 01:43.562
Oh!

01:43.645 --> 01:45.147
Come on, Joe.
You haven't even finished one.

01:45.230 --> 01:46.565
I mean, that guy had two.

01:46.648 --> 01:48.692
I know, I know,
I'm terrible.

01:48.775 --> 01:51.111
Which is why
I'm gonna order the cheesecake.

01:51.195 --> 01:53.197
Oh, I can't do it. I'm...

01:53.280 --> 01:54.948
I'm so full.

01:55.032 --> 01:56.283
Full of what? Estrogen.

01:56.366 --> 01:58.076
Come on, take
the skirt off, you pansy.

01:58.160 --> 01:59.161
Oh!

01:59.244 --> 02:00.829
Let's go.
Chow down, Mary Jane.

02:00.913 --> 02:02.289
I said, I can't.

02:02.372 --> 02:03.707
-Eat it. Eat the damn steak.
-No.

02:03.790 --> 02:05.292
-Come on! What are you waiting for?
-I can't.

02:05.375 --> 02:06.710
Eat it, Joe. Eat it!
No, no, no.

02:06.793 --> 02:08.879
Joe, eat it!
I said I'm not hungry!

02:09.963 --> 02:12.424
Where is it now, huh?
Where is it now?

02:12.508 --> 02:14.551
Easy, sailor, easy.

02:14.635 --> 02:16.386
Put the gun down, Joe.

02:16.470 --> 02:18.931
Yeah. Nobody's
judging you, man. It's cool.

02:19.014 --> 02:21.934
I'll just put this
back in your purse next to your tampons.

02:24.478 --> 02:25.812
All right,
let's start the bidding.

02:25.896 --> 02:28.607
Jennifer, how much do you bid
on the dinette set?

02:28.690 --> 02:29.816
Um...

02:29.900 --> 02:31.777
$675, Bob.

02:31.860 --> 02:33.070
$675. Steven?

02:33.153 --> 02:34.321
Uh, $780.

02:34.404 --> 02:36.865
-$780. Tammy?
-What was the last bid?

02:36.949 --> 02:38.742
-$780.
-$781.

02:39.451 --> 02:41.078
(Bleep) you!

02:41.870 --> 02:43.747
Hi, honey.
How was your physical?

02:43.830 --> 02:46.083
Good. Good. Good.
Yeah. Yeah.

02:46.166 --> 02:47.584
Too good,
matter of fact.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.253
You know
what the doctor said?

02:49.336 --> 02:51.547
Doctor said I was
too healthy, you know?

02:51.630 --> 02:53.257
In too good of shape.

02:53.340 --> 02:55.342
Don't even know how.
Too good of shape.

02:55.425 --> 02:57.094
You didn't go to
your physical, did you?

02:57.177 --> 02:58.512
Uh, I did not.

03:00.681 --> 03:02.975
So, Doctor?
Is Peter healthy?

03:03.058 --> 03:04.977
My goodness!
You'll be dead within a month.

03:05.060 --> 03:06.061
BOTH: What?

03:06.144 --> 03:08.522
Oh, Hagar the Horrible,
if you keep up that lifestyle

03:08.605 --> 03:11.316
of pillaging and giant turkey legs,
you'll be dead within a month.

03:11.400 --> 03:12.484
Now, on to you.

03:12.568 --> 03:14.278
So, what do you think?
Pretty healthy, huh?

03:14.361 --> 03:17.155
Well, Mr. Griffin, let's take a look
at your physical results.

03:17.239 --> 03:18.240
(screaming)

03:18.365 --> 03:20.826
There's a spider in here.
Now, here we go.

03:20.909 --> 03:22.828
Mr. Griffin, you're going to
expire in a month.

03:22.911 --> 03:23.912
(exclaiming)

03:23.996 --> 03:25.622
This is
your driver's license, isn't it?

03:25.706 --> 03:28.667
Now, unfortunately,
I'm afraid you are going to die

03:28.750 --> 03:30.961
when you watch
these Dean Martin celebrity roasts.

03:31.044 --> 03:33.547
Will you just tell us
how Peter's health is?

03:33.630 --> 03:36.758
Mr. Griffin, I'm not quite
sure how to say this.

03:36.842 --> 03:42.264
Kim Bass-inger, Base-inger,
Basin-jer, Basinger?

03:42.347 --> 03:44.016
But now on to the cancer.

03:44.099 --> 03:45.100
-Ah!
-Oh, my God!

03:45.184 --> 03:47.519
You are a Cancer, right?
You were born in July?

03:47.603 --> 03:48.979
Now, on to these test results.

03:49.062 --> 03:51.523
My, they're much worse
than I thought.

03:51.607 --> 03:54.109
My son got a D minus
on his history test.

03:54.193 --> 03:55.986
Now, Mr. Griffin,
that liver's got to come out.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.362
BOTH: What?

03:57.446 --> 03:59.698
It's been in the microwave
for three minutes. It'll get dry. Now...

03:59.781 --> 04:01.867
Please. Please.

04:01.950 --> 04:04.786
We can't take
any more shtick.

04:04.870 --> 04:07.206
Please, just tell us,
is Peter healthy?

04:07.289 --> 04:09.291
Oh, yeah. He's fine.
He's just really fat.

04:09.374 --> 04:10.459
Oh, thank God!

04:10.542 --> 04:12.211
Wait, wait, wait.
Hang on a second.

04:12.294 --> 04:13.962
Did you just say
I was fat?

04:14.046 --> 04:16.465
Well, yeah.
You are pretty fat.

04:16.548 --> 04:17.799
Um,

04:17.883 --> 04:21.178
okay.
This is news to me.

04:21.261 --> 04:24.223
Boy! This is more awkward
than having sex with a rhinoceros

04:24.306 --> 04:26.391
who doesn't love you anymore.

04:26.475 --> 04:29.019
Why wouldn't you
look at me during?

04:30.145 --> 04:32.648
(sobbing)

04:35.234 --> 04:36.735
Hey, how was your physical?

04:36.818 --> 04:39.738
Stupid doctor said I was fat.
Can you believe that idiot?

04:39.821 --> 04:41.573
Well, Peter,
you are on the large side.

04:41.657 --> 04:43.242
Oh, please, Brian.
If I was fat,

04:43.325 --> 04:44.910
could I do this
with a Hula-Hoop?

04:46.161 --> 04:47.663
(groaning)

04:49.206 --> 04:50.749
(tittering)

04:53.335 --> 04:57.089
No. No, no, I guess
you couldn't do that if you were fat.

05:00.092 --> 05:02.594
Careful, Peter.
That's an old family photo.

05:02.678 --> 05:04.346
My mother gave it to me.

05:04.429 --> 05:06.348
Huh, that's weird.

05:10.185 --> 05:12.771
-I didn't know you had a brother.
-I don't.

05:12.855 --> 05:14.857
I mean, I don't think so.

05:14.940 --> 05:17.317
Hey, if I'm fat,
then Stewie's fat, too.

05:17.401 --> 05:18.986
Because we wear
the same size onesie.

05:23.448 --> 05:25.284
(cell phone ringing)

05:25.367 --> 05:26.952
Hello, pumpkin.
Hello, Daddy?

05:27.035 --> 05:28.704
Did I miss
your piano recital?

05:28.787 --> 05:30.789
No, Daddy.
I'm in my 40s now.

05:30.873 --> 05:31.874
Good God!

05:31.957 --> 05:34.293
I had a question
I wanted to ask.

05:34.376 --> 05:36.628
Um, do I have a brother?

05:36.712 --> 05:38.088
(stuttering)

05:38.172 --> 05:39.965
No, no. Don't be silly.

05:40.048 --> 05:41.383
'Cause I found
this picture...

05:41.466 --> 05:45.345
Uh, uh... Oh, Dick. Thank God
you're here. Talk to her.

05:45.429 --> 05:47.931
Message CM-27.

05:48.015 --> 05:50.017
The subscriber you are
trying to reach

05:50.100 --> 05:52.895
is unavailable or outside
the calling area.

05:53.645 --> 05:54.646
What do you feel
like doing later?

05:54.730 --> 05:57.191
Message CM-42.

05:57.274 --> 06:00.319
Let's go pay some hookers
to knock our junk around.

06:03.030 --> 06:04.781
Are you sure
this is a good idea?

06:04.865 --> 06:06.992
Daddy's never gonna
tell me the truth.

06:07.075 --> 06:09.703
The only way to find out
is to check the family records.

06:09.786 --> 06:12.706
Ah, breaking into Grandma
and Grandpa's house.

06:12.789 --> 06:15.375
This is more exciting
than that time I saw Bobby McFerrin

06:15.459 --> 06:17.002
fall down all those stairs.

06:17.920 --> 06:19.755
(scatting)

06:23.383 --> 06:24.968
Cool!

06:27.054 --> 06:29.139
Wait. What are you doing?
They're sleeping in here.

06:29.264 --> 06:32.434
Oh, please. They get
so doped up on sleeping pills and liquor,

06:32.518 --> 06:34.811
an earthquake wouldn't
wake them up.

06:38.440 --> 06:40.651
My God! How does she
sleep at night

06:40.734 --> 06:43.070
knowing she has to funnel
this old duffer's hog?

06:46.448 --> 06:49.201
(gasps) This is it!
Patrick Pewterschmidt.

06:49.284 --> 06:53.288
56 Meadow Lane, Brookfield.
I do have a brother.

06:53.372 --> 06:54.873
Oh, my God.
I've got to meet him.

06:54.957 --> 06:57.668
Oh, hey, Brian.
You know what would be fun?

06:58.585 --> 07:00.128
Oh, God, totally!

07:00.212 --> 07:02.130
-Yeah!
-Whoo!

07:03.131 --> 07:04.299
BOTH: Awesome!

07:04.383 --> 07:07.052
You know, sometimes
the old-fashioned playthings are the best.

07:07.135 --> 07:09.429
ADVERTISING MAN:
Hey, kids of America.

07:09.513 --> 07:11.223
It's hand-painted
wooden ball in a cup.

07:11.306 --> 07:14.434
Who needs constant
electronic video stimulation

07:14.518 --> 07:16.144
when there's ball in a cup?

07:16.228 --> 07:19.815
Mexico's favorite toy
for over 340 years.

07:19.898 --> 07:22.651
Toss the ball,
catch it in the cup,

07:22.734 --> 07:24.653
dump it out of the cup,
toss it,

07:24.736 --> 07:26.280
and catch it in the cup again.

07:26.363 --> 07:29.449
The ball is on a string
and attached to the cup.

07:29.533 --> 07:31.910
So there's no worry
if you don't catch the ball in the cup.

07:31.994 --> 07:35.747
And cleanup is as easy
as catching a ball in a cup.

07:35.831 --> 07:38.625
So why spend another day
not catching a ball in a cup

07:38.709 --> 07:40.919
when you could be
catching a ball in a cup?

07:41.003 --> 07:42.296
SINGERS:Ball in a cup

07:42.379 --> 07:43.547
Ball in a cup

07:43.630 --> 07:44.673
It's a ball in a cup

07:44.798 --> 07:45.799
Ball in a cup!

07:45.883 --> 07:47.050
Ball in a cup

07:49.887 --> 07:52.472
Peter, I think maybe
you're in denial about this fat thing.

07:52.556 --> 07:54.600
Oh, yeah?
Well, I challenge you to prove to me

07:54.683 --> 07:55.726
that I'm fat.

07:55.809 --> 07:57.686
Uh, okay, hang on.

07:57.769 --> 07:59.062
-See this?
-Yeah.

07:59.146 --> 08:00.147
You know what it is?

08:00.230 --> 08:01.607
Duh, it's an apple.

08:01.690 --> 08:03.859
Good, good, good.
All right, watch this.

08:06.278 --> 08:08.280
What the--
What is this?

08:08.363 --> 08:09.698
Is this some kind of gag?

08:09.781 --> 08:11.700
No. That's orbit.
Huh?

08:11.783 --> 08:13.744
You have your own
gravitational pull.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.662
Oh, that's a bunch of crap.

(chuckling)
Aw.

08:27.382 --> 08:29.343
(chuckling)
Aw.

08:30.928 --> 08:34.640
Oh! Can you believe
I'm about to meet my long lost brother?

08:34.723 --> 08:37.059
Maybe Dateline will do
a story on us, huh?

08:37.142 --> 08:39.561
I'll get to meet
that pompous ass, Stone Phillips.

08:39.645 --> 08:41.855
He's a kind of guy you hate
till he's inside you.

08:41.939 --> 08:43.857
There it is.

(gasping)
Oh, my God! Mom's brother's crazy.

08:52.115 --> 08:54.576
Oh, no. I didn't catch
the ball in the cup.

08:54.660 --> 08:56.119
Oh, wait a minute.

08:56.203 --> 08:58.830
It's okay because the ball is on a string
and attached to the cup.

09:05.963 --> 09:08.215
Doctor, is my brother
really insane?

09:08.298 --> 09:11.051
Mrs. Griffin,
we don't use the word "insane."

09:11.134 --> 09:13.220
We prefer the term
"mentally hilarious."

09:13.303 --> 09:15.138
Ooh, I can't wait to
meet the lunatic.

09:15.222 --> 09:17.766
I bet he's even weirder
than that commercial I saw.

09:17.850 --> 09:19.560
Hey, is that
that new butter substitute?

09:19.643 --> 09:20.894
It sure is.

09:20.978 --> 09:22.771
Is it true it has
half the calories of butter or margarine

09:22.855 --> 09:24.439
-with all the great taste?
-Yeah.

09:24.523 --> 09:25.899
Can I have some?
Get your own.

09:25.983 --> 09:27.276
Take that, you bitch!

09:27.359 --> 09:28.485
What the hell?

09:28.569 --> 09:29.611
How'd you like that?

09:29.695 --> 09:31.572
Hey, joke's on you.
I have hepatitis.

09:31.655 --> 09:32.656
(groaning)

09:32.739 --> 09:34.491
Patrick?
Yes?

09:34.575 --> 09:37.578
My name's Lois.
I'm your sister.

09:37.661 --> 09:39.580
Oh, my God, Lois.

09:39.663 --> 09:41.456
I never thought
I'd see you again.

09:41.540 --> 09:42.833
These are my children.

09:42.916 --> 09:45.919
Why do you live
in a crazy house, Uncle Patrick?

09:46.003 --> 09:48.130
Well, when I was
just a little boy,

09:48.213 --> 09:50.841
I had a very
traumatic experience.

09:51.800 --> 09:54.011
Mommy, can I have
a drink of water?

09:54.094 --> 09:56.555
(gasping)
Jackie Gleason!

09:56.638 --> 09:58.015
Beat it, kid.
Your mother's busy.

09:58.098 --> 10:00.434
GLEASON: Humminah,
humminah, humminah, humminah.

10:00.517 --> 10:01.935
Pow, right in the kisser!

10:02.019 --> 10:04.688
-Oh, that's a horrible story.
-Yes.

10:04.771 --> 10:07.107
I was so traumatized
they sent me here.

10:07.191 --> 10:09.067
And I guess
they must have forgotten about me.

10:09.151 --> 10:11.111
Well, you seem
perfectly normal to me.

10:11.195 --> 10:12.779
And no brother of mine
is gonna be

10:12.863 --> 10:14.781
cooped up in
some insane asylum.

10:14.865 --> 10:17.492
We are taking you
back to Quahog with us.

10:17.576 --> 10:19.286
Oh, that's a great idea.

10:19.369 --> 10:21.246
Maybe he can bring
his sling blade and order up some

10:21.330 --> 10:23.248
(mimicking Billy Bob Thornton)
French-fried "potaters."

10:23.332 --> 10:24.333
Mmm-hmm.

10:26.210 --> 10:28.045
Thank God I'm out
of that hospital.

10:28.128 --> 10:30.631
It's great to be eating lunch
with my family

10:30.714 --> 10:32.716
instead of a bunch
of chronic masturbators.

10:32.799 --> 10:34.176
Those people are disgusting.

10:34.259 --> 10:37.221
Is it lonely up there
on your pedestal, Patrick?

10:37.304 --> 10:40.307
Oh, Peter, there you are.
This is my brother Patrick.

10:40.390 --> 10:41.850
Yeah, yeah.
Good to meet you, Patrick.

10:41.934 --> 10:43.101
All right,
listen up, everybody.

10:43.185 --> 10:44.978
I have something
to tell you.

10:45.062 --> 10:47.523
I'm not quite sure
how to say this.

10:48.565 --> 10:49.733
I'm fat.

10:49.816 --> 10:52.319
Let me give you
a minute to absorb that.

10:52.402 --> 10:55.197
That's the way it is.
It's nobody's fault, Meg.

10:55.280 --> 10:57.491
But I've decided
to do something about it.

10:57.574 --> 11:00.035
Oh, great.
You gonna drop some weight, fat ass?

11:00.118 --> 11:03.413
No, dummy. I'm gonna help
make this a fat man's world

11:03.497 --> 11:08.085
by establishing the National Association
for the Advancement of Fat People.

11:08.168 --> 11:11.463
This is the best idea I've had
since I slayed that dragon.

11:13.382 --> 11:14.800
-Cybill Shepherd?
-Yes.

11:14.883 --> 11:16.051
(unsheathing)

11:17.427 --> 11:18.470
(roaring)

11:30.774 --> 11:33.902
People, you are free!

11:33.986 --> 11:35.320
(people cheering)

11:39.700 --> 11:42.244
You know, I'm very glad
you're here, Patrick.

11:42.327 --> 11:43.662
Well, I want
to tell you that

11:43.745 --> 11:46.248
Marian and I both
appreciate what you've done.

11:46.331 --> 11:49.334
Marian? Oh,
you have a girlfriend.

11:49.418 --> 11:52.421
Oh, where are my manners?
Marian is my wife.

11:52.504 --> 11:53.922
She is sitting
right next to me.

11:54.006 --> 11:55.716
Oh, here we go.

11:55.799 --> 11:57.801
Oh... huh.

11:57.885 --> 12:00.262
Nice to meet you, Marian.

12:00.345 --> 12:03.265
What's that, honey?
Oh, yes. Hang on.

12:03.348 --> 12:05.434
Marian wants some coffee.

12:05.517 --> 12:07.561
Lois, did you see that?
He's nuts.

12:07.644 --> 12:10.647
Brian, he's been locked up
in that place for 30 years.

12:10.731 --> 12:13.150
It's perfectly understandable
that he'd invent

12:13.233 --> 12:15.027
an imaginary companion.

12:15.110 --> 12:18.488
Yes. He's even more imaginative
than the people who invented singing.

12:18.572 --> 12:20.324
(groaning)

12:21.617 --> 12:23.035
(grunting)

12:30.167 --> 12:33.837
Oh, oh, oh

12:33.921 --> 12:36.924
-The longest
-For the longest time

12:37.007 --> 12:39.134
Whoa, oh, oh

12:39.218 --> 12:40.969
-The longest
-For the longest

12:41.053 --> 12:44.973
If you say good-bye
to me tonight

12:45.057 --> 12:46.225
(scatting)

12:50.395 --> 12:52.773
All right, everyone,
I'd like to get started.

12:52.856 --> 12:56.777
-(all panting)
-I'd like to get-- We're start--

12:56.860 --> 12:59.738
You know what? Maybe...
Maybe everyone should sit down.

13:02.783 --> 13:05.327
(all wheezing)

13:10.749 --> 13:14.211
Okay, that's better.
Welcome, everybody, to the...

13:15.128 --> 13:17.381
(rustling packaging)

13:18.298 --> 13:19.341
Uh, uh...

13:19.424 --> 13:22.344
snacks are best
saved for later.

13:24.388 --> 13:25.430
(farting)

13:27.766 --> 13:28.767
(burping)

13:31.395 --> 13:32.396
(panting)

13:33.438 --> 13:34.439
(farting)

13:35.774 --> 13:37.150
(farting)

13:37.234 --> 13:39.528
Okay, now, I've prepared
an agenda for our organization,

13:39.611 --> 13:43.240
what we want from the community
as fat people with pride.

13:43.323 --> 13:45.158
(coughing)

13:45.242 --> 13:46.285
(panting continues)

13:47.035 --> 13:48.453
(farting continues)

13:52.249 --> 13:53.333
(burping continues)

13:55.085 --> 13:56.170
(farting continues)

13:58.922 --> 14:00.591
(crashing)

14:00.674 --> 14:02.843
All right, I think
we got a lot accomplished here today.

14:02.926 --> 14:04.928
We'll pick this up
again tomorrow.

14:07.389 --> 14:09.600
Hey, guys,
I'm going for a run.

14:09.683 --> 14:12.728
Do me a favor
and keep Marian company while I'm gone.

14:12.811 --> 14:14.313
Uh, sure.

14:14.396 --> 14:17.816
Great. Bye, honey.
(kissing)

14:17.900 --> 14:20.944
Hey, Brian.
Marian just called you an alcoholic.

14:21.028 --> 14:24.364
Oh, yeah?
Marian just called you a homo.

14:24.448 --> 14:27.576
Wait a second.
I'll be right back.

14:27.659 --> 14:31.705
Hey, Brian, Brian.
What if I put this cucumber right here?

14:31.788 --> 14:33.665
Put the cucumber
right there.

14:33.749 --> 14:35.209
Do you think Patrick
would be angry?

14:35.292 --> 14:37.044
I don't know, man.
It's his wife.

14:37.127 --> 14:39.546
You don't think
he'd be ticked off if I put this...

14:39.630 --> 14:40.964
Just put that right there?

14:41.048 --> 14:43.467
Just right in that spot,
right there on the couch?

14:43.550 --> 14:45.677
Hey, Marian's giving you
a thumb's up.

14:45.761 --> 14:47.846
You know what we should do?

14:47.930 --> 14:50.891
We should let it sit here for a couple
of weeks and see if it pickles.

14:50.974 --> 14:52.643
(both laughing)

14:52.726 --> 14:56.230
If after three weeks
it pickles, then she's real

14:56.313 --> 14:58.190
and we both have
to buy Patrick a steak.

14:58.273 --> 14:59.816
(both guffawing)

15:03.278 --> 15:04.780
(crickets chirping)

15:04.863 --> 15:08.367
Hey, pie.
I know what you want.

15:08.450 --> 15:09.535
I saw you in that movie.

15:09.618 --> 15:11.578
Whore, slut, bitch.

15:11.662 --> 15:13.539
You don't deserve
to have sex with me.

15:13.622 --> 15:15.707
Instead, I'm gonna
eat the whore out of you.

15:15.791 --> 15:18.502
Peter, did you start
a coalition for fat guys?

15:18.585 --> 15:20.087
Yeah. The fat-guy coalition.

15:20.170 --> 15:22.548
Peter, you shouldn't
encourage people to be fat.

15:22.631 --> 15:24.216
Fat people are immoral.

15:24.299 --> 15:25.676
How do you figure,
sports fan?

15:25.759 --> 15:29.012
They're just bad people,
like that Jackie Gleason.

15:29.096 --> 15:31.139
He was fat and he was bad.

15:31.223 --> 15:32.474
One time when I was a boy...

15:32.558 --> 15:34.101
Oh, I love Jackie Gleason.

15:34.184 --> 15:37.855
Hey, take a look
at what I bought at this TV convention.

15:37.938 --> 15:41.108
(chuckling)
It's a bus driver's uniform.

15:41.191 --> 15:43.151
Pow, right in the kisser!

15:44.903 --> 15:47.948
Pow, right in the kisser!
Pow, right in the kisser!

15:48.031 --> 15:51.493
Pow, right in the kisser!
Pow, right in the kisser!

15:51.577 --> 15:53.078
Pow, right in the kisser!

15:53.161 --> 15:54.580
Pow, right in the kisser!

15:54.663 --> 15:56.081
Pow, right in the kisser!

15:56.164 --> 15:57.958
Pow, right in the kisser!

15:58.041 --> 15:59.042
Pow, right in the kisser!

15:59.168 --> 16:00.169
(screaming)

16:00.252 --> 16:03.839
Wow! That set him off
like a Paul Shaffer fire alarm.

16:05.674 --> 16:07.134
(Paul Shaffer's voice
screaming)

16:13.724 --> 16:15.142
(ringing)

16:15.225 --> 16:17.269
-Hello?
-Lois, it's your father.

16:17.352 --> 16:19.521
The hospital called
and said you released Patrick.

16:19.605 --> 16:21.857
Have you lost your mind?
He's incredibly dangerous.

16:21.940 --> 16:25.110
Oh, well, that's ridiculous.
Patrick is a very nice man.

16:25.194 --> 16:28.655
And you should be ashamed of yourself
for locking up your own son.

16:29.615 --> 16:31.033
Whose pickle is this?

16:31.283 --> 16:33.660
This just in.
The body of a local fat man

16:33.744 --> 16:36.371
was found murdered
in Quahog Park last night.

16:36.455 --> 16:38.290
Police released this sketch
of the suspect.

16:40.501 --> 16:41.752
Oh, my God!

16:41.835 --> 16:44.630
Police also released
this sketch of a female accomplice

16:44.796 --> 16:46.298
believed to be his wife.

16:54.723 --> 16:56.183
Hello, I'm Tom Tucker.

16:56.266 --> 16:59.478
Quahog's newest serial killer
has struck again.

16:59.561 --> 17:01.688
Since the first victim
at Quahog Park last week,

17:01.772 --> 17:03.232
three more men
have been killed,

17:03.315 --> 17:05.484
all of them very, very fat.

17:05.567 --> 17:07.611
Lois, that sketch looks
a lot like Patrick.

17:07.694 --> 17:09.321
Oh, that's ridiculous.

17:09.404 --> 17:11.073
I don't know. I mean,
he's clearly crazy.

17:11.156 --> 17:12.991
Look at that
imaginary wife of his.

17:13.075 --> 17:16.328
Well, if she's imaginary, how do you
explain the pickle on the couch?

17:16.411 --> 17:18.205
I don't understand what...

17:18.288 --> 17:20.415
Oh, wait. What? Really?

17:20.499 --> 17:21.750
Hey, Stewie!

17:21.834 --> 17:23.585
STEWIE: I know,
I know. I heard!

17:26.088 --> 17:27.840
Patrick.

17:27.923 --> 17:29.049
Where have you been?

17:29.132 --> 17:32.427
Oh, it's nothing
you need to concern yourself with, Lois.

17:32.511 --> 17:34.346
Well, that's a relief.

17:34.429 --> 17:36.139
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, that's a relief.

17:36.223 --> 17:39.226
Yeah, the Fat Guy Strangler's living here
and there's a fat guy in the house.

17:39.309 --> 17:43.063
This'll be a bigger disaster
than when Peter did Tara Reid's boob job.

17:44.523 --> 17:46.608
Oh, dropped some
pepperoni on there.

17:46.692 --> 17:48.652
You know what?
That works. Sew it up.

17:49.987 --> 17:51.864
All right, everybody,
just make yourselves at home.

17:51.947 --> 17:54.324
Lois, these are
the fat guys. Fat guys, Lois.

17:54.408 --> 17:56.118
My God, look at you
fat bastards.

17:56.201 --> 17:58.704
I bet none of you
can even find your own penis.

17:58.787 --> 18:01.373
Find your penis for a dollar.
Find your penis, one dollar.

18:01.456 --> 18:03.917
One dollar, find your penis.
Find your penis here.

18:04.001 --> 18:05.335
Peter, what's going on?

18:05.419 --> 18:06.795
Lois, my people are in danger.

18:06.879 --> 18:09.631
Until they find
the Fat Guy Strangler, we will stay--

18:09.715 --> 18:11.133
Victor, don't lean
against that.

18:11.216 --> 18:12.259
(Meg screaming)

18:12.342 --> 18:13.385
Hey, everybody.

18:13.468 --> 18:15.095
Peter, you gotta get
these guys out of here.

18:15.179 --> 18:17.264
-Patrick is the murderer.
-What?

18:17.347 --> 18:19.725
-(gasping)
-You son of a bitch!

18:19.808 --> 18:22.603
Don't listen to Brian.
He doesn't know what he's talking about.

18:22.686 --> 18:25.230
Out of my way, Lois.
Your brother is toast.

18:25.314 --> 18:27.191
Warm buttery toast!

18:27.274 --> 18:28.400
(all moaning)

18:28.483 --> 18:30.235
-That sounds good.
-I love toast.

18:30.319 --> 18:31.361
I just found my penis.

18:31.445 --> 18:32.863
Run, Patrick, run!

18:32.946 --> 18:34.031
After him!

18:35.824 --> 18:37.534
Boys, to your Rascals!

18:45.250 --> 18:47.628
He went into James Woods.
Let's spread out and find him.

18:47.753 --> 18:49.379
We'll head him off at the...

18:49.463 --> 18:51.173
(chicken clucking)

18:51.256 --> 18:53.091
Todd, man, you got
to chew your food.

18:55.052 --> 18:58.597
Brian, I know my brother.
He couldn't have done these things.

18:58.680 --> 19:01.058
Well, let's see
if you feel that way when you see this.

19:02.100 --> 19:03.393
Look.

19:09.274 --> 19:12.361
So he has pictures of himself
strangling fat guys.

19:12.444 --> 19:14.613
That doesn't mean
he's the Fat Guy Strangler.

19:14.696 --> 19:17.115
Oh, yeah? What about
the dead fat guy under his bed?

19:17.199 --> 19:18.283
Coincidence?

19:18.367 --> 19:20.285
What about the half-dead
fat guy in the corner?

19:20.369 --> 19:21.870
Patrick tried to kill me.

19:21.954 --> 19:24.206
-Well, maybe it's a different Patrick.
-Lois!

19:24.289 --> 19:26.625
Okay, okay. Oh, my God!

19:26.708 --> 19:29.211
Peter's out there with him!
Wait!

19:29.294 --> 19:30.963
You gonna eat
that dead fat guy?

19:32.589 --> 19:34.508
How are we gonna find them?

19:34.591 --> 19:36.093
Don't worry, Lois.
I'm good at finding people.

19:36.176 --> 19:38.846
I was the one who found Bush
after Hurricane Katrina.

19:40.889 --> 19:43.475
-Mr. President, are you up there?
-Go away!

19:43.559 --> 19:45.435
Sir, there's a disaster
in New Orleans.

19:45.519 --> 19:46.645
I'm reading Superfudge.

19:46.728 --> 19:47.980
You got to come down
and deal with this.

19:48.063 --> 19:49.439
Don't make me do stuff.

19:50.357 --> 19:52.693
Patrick? Patrick!

19:52.776 --> 19:54.778
Oh, crap! Guess we lost him.

19:54.862 --> 19:57.823
Well, nothing left to do
but finish this sentence uninterrupt--

19:57.906 --> 19:58.907
(shouting)

20:01.410 --> 20:03.245
Patrick, let him go!

20:03.328 --> 20:04.621
Don't come any closer!

20:04.705 --> 20:08.667
Patrick, let him go
or Marian gets it.

20:08.750 --> 20:11.712
Nice try.
But Marian's over there.

20:13.255 --> 20:14.882
Don't hurt her!

20:16.508 --> 20:17.926
Now, let him go!

20:18.010 --> 20:19.136
Okay! Okay!

20:20.429 --> 20:22.139
-Ah! You missed!
-No, I didn't.

20:22.222 --> 20:25.142
That's for rolling up the damn window
when I tried to jump into the General Lee.

20:25.225 --> 20:30.022
I'm sorry, Lois.
I never meant to hurt anybody.

20:30.105 --> 20:33.859
I mean, I did mean to kill those fat guys,
but I never meant to hurt you.

20:33.942 --> 20:36.987
You may be very sick, Patrick,
but I love you.

20:37.070 --> 20:39.781
You're my brother
and you'll always be my brother.

20:39.865 --> 20:42.367
I have to go back to
the hospital, don't I?

20:42.451 --> 20:44.119
Yeah. I'm afraid so.

20:44.203 --> 20:46.955
Hey, Patrick. Did you see
how that rock hit me in the face?

20:47.039 --> 20:48.624
It was like, pow,
right in the kisser!

20:48.707 --> 20:50.042
Pow, right in the kisser!

20:50.125 --> 20:51.126
Pow, right in the kisser!

20:51.210 --> 20:52.336
(screaming)

20:52.419 --> 20:54.713
Stop screaming, you can't hear me.
Pow, right in the kisser!

20:54.796 --> 20:56.089
Pow, right in the kisser!

20:56.173 --> 20:57.257
Pow, right in the kisser!

20:59.468 --> 21:00.886
I miss Uncle Patrick.

21:00.969 --> 21:04.223
Don't worry, kids.
I promise we can visit him once a month.

21:04.306 --> 21:05.974
We'll be his period.

21:06.642 --> 21:08.018
I was just upstairs

21:08.101 --> 21:11.813
and there's
a half-dead fat guy eating a dead fat guy.

21:13.232 --> 21:16.485
Uh-huh. So I guess
we're just looking the other way, huh?

21:20.280 --> 21:22.491
(theme music playing)
