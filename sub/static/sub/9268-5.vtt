00:44.900 --> 00:46.100
Nie.

01:00.700 --> 01:02.780
Nie!

01:34.100 --> 01:37.060
I reckon the storm caused
a surge in the power grid

01:37.060 --> 01:40.260
because the whole of Kembleford
went ka-blooey last night.

01:40.260 --> 01:43.540
I'm sure I've seen that symbol
somewhere before.

01:43.540 --> 01:46.140
Oh, probably Satanists, Father.

01:46.140 --> 01:48.620
And the Lord said,
"Let there be light."

01:48.620 --> 01:50.340
Wahey!

01:50.340 --> 01:53.420
"And the light shineth in darkness,

01:53.420 --> 01:55.940
"and the darkness
recognised it not."

01:57.900 --> 02:00.980
Well, at last. Sorry, Father.

02:00.980 --> 02:03.180
Not to worry. Everything all right?

02:03.180 --> 02:05.780
Yes, but...
Your list of chores.

02:07.700 --> 02:09.380
Father, why are you going?

02:09.380 --> 02:13.980
You not had one of these? The whole
town's been deluged with them.

02:13.980 --> 02:16.380
Yeah... Your chores!

02:16.380 --> 02:20.580
Right, Father, let's go and find out
what all this nonsense is about.

02:22.220 --> 02:27.500
You stupid girl. I have spent
a whole hour alphabetising those.

02:28.700 --> 02:31.380
You sure everything's all right?
Yes, I'm fine.

02:32.980 --> 02:34.620
Have a good day.

02:38.460 --> 02:41.700
I make...I make tea?

02:41.700 --> 02:44.780
Oh, wish I could, darling, but,
you know, four more jobs today.

02:44.780 --> 02:47.900
Storm damage. Terrible thing.

03:45.380 --> 03:46.980
We come in peace.

04:16.980 --> 04:19.899
Looks like they've come
in their pyjamas.

04:19.899 --> 04:22.580
And is that supposed to be music?

04:23.860 --> 04:26.700
Let's both try and keep
an open mind, shall we?

04:40.900 --> 04:45.660
Good people of Kembleford,
our founder and leader, Kalon.

04:58.500 --> 05:00.620
What a glorious sight.

05:01.900 --> 05:03.260
Welcome.

05:04.700 --> 05:06.780
Welcome, all.

05:10.300 --> 05:15.260
I was covered in mud.
I was broken, bloodied.

05:15.260 --> 05:17.260
There were shells exploding
all around me,

05:17.260 --> 05:18.620
bullets whizzing past my ear.

05:18.620 --> 05:22.780
I was engulfed in pain,
I was paralysed by fear.

05:22.780 --> 05:25.620
And then it happened.

05:26.860 --> 05:28.260
A sniper's bullet...

05:29.500 --> 05:32.380
..through my brain and
out through the back of my head.

05:33.460 --> 05:38.700
And I fell back, staring into
the noonday sun, in the mud,

05:38.700 --> 05:42.380
and barely had I registered
what had happened to me,

05:42.380 --> 05:45.740
when in a burst of pure joy,

05:45.740 --> 05:49.260
the knowledge of millennia
was delivered into my brain.

05:50.500 --> 05:54.820
From the astral ancestors dwelling
within the fiery core of the sun,

05:54.820 --> 05:57.340
to the deepest recesses of my soul...

05:58.500 --> 06:02.140
..transported on a ribbon of energy,

06:02.140 --> 06:06.580
93 million miles across empty space.

06:08.300 --> 06:12.420
And as this beautiful knowledge,
it filled me up, I was pure peace.

06:13.780 --> 06:15.140
Pure joy.

06:16.740 --> 06:18.220
Pure hope.

06:27.580 --> 06:28.900
So much hope.

06:41.220 --> 06:46.060
I was given a purpose that day -
to carry this wisdom to the rest of

06:46.060 --> 06:51.140
humanity. For the path to happiness
lies within the life-giving sun.

06:52.940 --> 06:55.580
By harnessing its eternal energies...

06:58.100 --> 07:02.060
..we chase away the demons,
we vanquish the loneliness,

07:02.060 --> 07:07.900
we reach a higher plane where
spiritual, emotional and physical

07:07.900 --> 07:11.900
healing can belong to us all.

07:17.220 --> 07:20.140
Of course, I don't expect you
to take my word for it.

07:22.260 --> 07:25.340
But I can offer you something
that other religions,

07:25.340 --> 07:27.460
in my experience, can never provide.

07:33.820 --> 07:34.860
Proof.

07:37.740 --> 07:38.980
You.

07:41.700 --> 07:46.060
Come, come forward.
Don't be afraid. Come.

07:50.740 --> 07:52.780
Follow the light, come.

07:53.860 --> 07:56.780
She can't have finished
those chores already.

07:56.780 --> 07:58.380
I'll be having words with her.

08:03.180 --> 08:07.300
Welcome. What is your name?

08:08.660 --> 08:09.940
Susie.

08:11.420 --> 08:13.140
Susie?

08:13.140 --> 08:15.660
That's how everybody calls me.

08:15.660 --> 08:17.140
But your family?

08:18.260 --> 08:21.780
They called me Zuzanna.

08:23.460 --> 08:25.980
Zuzanna, what a beautiful name.

08:27.900 --> 08:32.940
Trust me, Zuzanna. All I want
is to open your eyes.

08:34.620 --> 08:37.659
The astral spirits are with us today.

08:38.780 --> 08:40.620
They are with us now.
I can feel them.

08:43.980 --> 08:47.100
Sit. Sit.

08:48.580 --> 08:50.100
Trust me, Zuzanna.

08:53.180 --> 08:55.260
Sense the sun on your skin.

08:59.380 --> 09:00.740
Close your eyes.

09:02.180 --> 09:03.620
Take a deep breath.

09:05.780 --> 09:07.180
Let it go.

09:08.540 --> 09:11.260
Feel the sun's energy filling you up.

09:14.060 --> 09:17.380
There is a lonely place
inside of you, Zuzanna.

09:18.500 --> 09:21.540
It's been there a long time.

09:21.540 --> 09:23.380
Since you were a child.

09:24.780 --> 09:28.860
Your father....gave his life
in battle, yes?

09:28.860 --> 09:32.020
Yes. And your mother
passed away, too. Yes.

09:32.020 --> 09:36.540
Oh, Zuzanna. Know that the
astral spirits of your mother

09:36.540 --> 09:41.860
and father, your parents,
are here now. I can see their faces.

09:41.860 --> 09:43.620
Oh, Zuzanna.

09:44.940 --> 09:46.860
They miss you so much.

09:46.860 --> 09:49.860
They love you so deeply.
Can you feel them?

09:51.500 --> 09:54.060
I.... I...

09:54.060 --> 09:56.340
Can you feel them?

09:56.340 --> 10:00.540
Their love? Their warmth? Their joy?
Their light? Do you feel them?

10:00.540 --> 10:04.580
Can you feel them?
Yes. Yes. Yes, yes.

10:12.780 --> 10:14.940
Mostly Barnum statements.

10:14.940 --> 10:17.620
Plus some cold reasoning,

10:17.620 --> 10:19.860
a few high probability deductions...

10:21.460 --> 10:23.060
..the power of suggestion.

10:23.060 --> 10:25.620
So you're saying he's a charlatan?

10:25.620 --> 10:28.700
That I'm not sure of yet.
Either he is,

10:28.700 --> 10:31.820
or he really thinks he has a gift.

10:32.860 --> 10:37.580
What if I genuinely have a gift.
Is that not also a possibility?

10:37.580 --> 10:42.100
Many things are possible.
The question is, what's probable?

10:44.780 --> 10:48.420
Might I ask what is
the meaning of the symbol?

10:48.420 --> 10:51.740
It represents the duality of
night and day, delivered to me

10:51.740 --> 10:53.340
in a vision by the astral spirits.

10:54.340 --> 10:55.620
I see.

10:55.620 --> 10:57.140
Father, surely, you of all people,

10:57.140 --> 11:00.500
believe in the
transcendence of the spirit.

11:00.500 --> 11:03.980
This is my astral partner,
Dominique.

11:03.980 --> 11:06.380
That's like a wife, is it?

11:06.380 --> 11:11.700
Oh, so much more. A symbiosis of
souls, an amalgamation of destiny.

11:11.700 --> 11:13.260
Oh, right you are.

11:14.300 --> 11:18.060
The transcendence of the spirit
I'm all for, but turning someone's

11:18.060 --> 11:22.100
grief into a theatrical event,
that I find somewhat dubious.

11:22.100 --> 11:25.060
I lost my husband
and sons in the war.

11:25.060 --> 11:29.540
Kalon has been my salvation from
grief, as he has for everyone here.

11:31.740 --> 11:35.180
What exactly do you find
dubious about that, Father?

11:35.180 --> 11:37.700
I was hoping for a little
ecumenical goodwill.

11:40.060 --> 11:42.860
I'm truly sorry about your family.

11:42.860 --> 11:47.500
But understand, I am merely looking
after the interests of my flock.

11:48.980 --> 11:52.020
And I'm the Big Bad Wolf? Precisely.

11:52.020 --> 11:54.020
Nobody's being preyed upon.

11:55.780 --> 12:00.220
Then might I ask,
how much does it cost

12:00.220 --> 12:02.020
to join your order?

12:02.020 --> 12:05.660
Nothing. Everything the religion
needs, it gets from me.

12:05.660 --> 12:08.460
Dominique's family is absurdly rich.
Banking and such like.

12:08.460 --> 12:11.700
So you see, our intentions
here are completely benign.

12:11.700 --> 12:15.860
We're not here to swindle your
parishioners or steal your souls.

12:15.860 --> 12:18.140
All we're asking for is a
quiet corner of the world

12:18.140 --> 12:21.020
to practise our faith. Now,
that is not too much to ask, is it?

12:21.020 --> 12:22.420
Will you excuse me?

12:29.380 --> 12:30.860
So....

12:30.860 --> 12:34.140
How long have you two
been amalgamated?

12:40.060 --> 12:43.540
I want to thank you for volunteering.

12:43.540 --> 12:46.460
Astral communion can be
an overwhelming experience,

12:46.460 --> 12:48.500
especially the first time.

12:48.500 --> 12:51.540
I should like to personally
invite you to join us

12:51.540 --> 12:54.300
to greet the sun tomorrow morning.
Greet the sun?

12:54.300 --> 12:56.460
Yes, it is a ritual,
the way we start the day.

12:56.460 --> 12:59.220
Oh. Zuzanna.

13:01.180 --> 13:04.580
I have done hundreds of readings
for hundreds of people and not

13:04.580 --> 13:08.140
since Dominique have I felt a spirit
so vibrant, so primed for change.

13:10.460 --> 13:13.460
Give yourself the chance to be
whatever it is you want to be.

13:15.860 --> 13:18.380
I don't know. Trust me.

13:21.740 --> 13:24.780
Everything you could ever
want is in there.

13:24.780 --> 13:28.700
With time you will be able
to communicate with the

13:28.700 --> 13:31.820
astral spirits of your
father and mother

13:31.820 --> 13:35.100
all by yourself. You will
never feel alone again.

13:39.020 --> 13:40.260
5:00 AM.

13:51.580 --> 13:53.820
All right?

13:53.820 --> 13:56.580
Yes, I'm fine. See you tomorrow.

14:56.740 --> 14:59.700
We greet the sun with
humble reverence,

14:59.700 --> 15:03.980
we pay our respects to the ancient
astral spirits and thank them

15:03.980 --> 15:07.380
for showing us the way
and for blessing me,

15:07.380 --> 15:11.300
their humble servant, with the gift
of their message.

15:11.300 --> 15:15.500
We greet thee, we greet thee,
we greet thee.

15:15.500 --> 15:19.220
ALL: We greet thee,
we greet thee, we greet thee.

15:20.260 --> 15:24.420
ALL: We greet thee, we greet thee,
we greet thee.

15:24.420 --> 15:29.100
We greet thee, we greet thee,
we greet thee.

15:29.100 --> 15:33.540
We greet thee, we greet thee,
we greet thee.

15:33.540 --> 15:37.620
We greet thee, we greet thee,
we greet thee.

15:43.340 --> 15:45.580
Father, will you stop playing
with your food?

15:49.460 --> 15:51.020
And she's late again.

15:54.820 --> 15:57.940
I'll take a stroll down to the camp.
And what time do you call this?

15:57.940 --> 15:59.580
Susie's gone.

16:05.900 --> 16:09.820
What's the matter?
Why aren't you communing?

16:09.820 --> 16:12.140
I...

16:12.140 --> 16:16.180
I can't concentrate. Don't force it.

16:16.180 --> 16:18.540
Let each thought come
and go as it pleases.

16:19.820 --> 16:21.780
You can do it.

16:22.860 --> 16:26.300
What's the point? Excuse me?

16:26.300 --> 16:29.100
Ten months I'm here.
I can still barely sleep,

16:29.100 --> 16:30.940
still hobbling about like a cripple.

16:30.940 --> 16:33.580
You can't expect the transitioning
to happen overnight.

16:33.580 --> 16:37.060
Then when? How much longer
do I have to be like this?

16:37.060 --> 16:39.420
Kalon says it's when your
body and spirit...

16:39.420 --> 16:42.380
I don't care what Kalon says.
Adam? He's....

16:45.420 --> 16:46.460
Adam!

16:47.540 --> 16:49.580
This is a delicate time.

16:49.580 --> 16:52.340
She needs to be free
of negative influences.

16:52.340 --> 16:53.900
Negative influences?

16:53.900 --> 16:56.820
I realise you care about her,
but whether you choose to admit it

16:56.820 --> 16:58.940
or not, you don't want her to change.

17:00.100 --> 17:01.620
She fulfils a role in your life.

17:01.620 --> 17:03.580
She makes you feel secure,
comfortable.

17:03.580 --> 17:05.859
More Barnum statements.

17:05.859 --> 17:08.339
I am normally a very
placid man, Father,

17:08.339 --> 17:10.420
but you are beginning to irritate me.

17:10.420 --> 17:13.900
Then, trust me, the quickest way
to get rid of me is to give in.

17:13.900 --> 17:17.500
All I ask is ten minutes.
Come back in a few days...

17:18.859 --> 17:20.780
..after her initiation.

17:34.940 --> 17:37.740
Kalon is a vessel
for ancient wisdom.

17:37.740 --> 17:40.260
How can you be so blind?
That's enough.

17:40.260 --> 17:42.220
Or do you just look
the other way on purpose?

17:42.220 --> 17:45.300
I don't know what you're talking
about. Yes, you do.

17:45.300 --> 17:47.740
Lisa, Daisy.

17:47.740 --> 17:50.340
Those girls were disruptive to
the harmony of the community.

17:50.340 --> 17:53.260
So you said at the time.
This is none of your business.

17:53.260 --> 17:55.540
I think it's the business
of everyone here to know

17:55.540 --> 17:58.100
they're being led by a man
of low moral character.

17:58.100 --> 18:01.940
Kalon is a great man,
but he's still a man.

18:01.940 --> 18:05.620
Yes, I sent those girls away, but
I did it before he could be tempted.

18:05.620 --> 18:10.500
They wanted him. Is that right? Yes.

18:10.500 --> 18:11.820
And what about the new girl?

18:13.340 --> 18:14.740
The way he looks at her?

18:15.740 --> 18:18.580
There's more going on in his head
than spiritual enlightenment.

18:27.020 --> 18:28.260
What are you doing?

18:29.940 --> 18:33.980
So this is why you're
making up lies? Pathetic.

18:56.740 --> 18:59.140
Right, what I say is
we sneak in, we grab her.

18:59.140 --> 19:01.580
Once we've got her, we can
talk some sense into her.

19:01.580 --> 19:04.980
There's a word for that. Brilliant?
Kidnapping. That's it.

19:04.980 --> 19:06.460
Breaks one of those law-thingies

19:06.460 --> 19:08.340
you may have heard about
from time to time.

19:12.060 --> 19:15.060
Wait here. Keep a look-out.

19:48.740 --> 19:52.420
Father! Father.

19:52.420 --> 19:54.140
You have to leave.

19:54.140 --> 19:56.980
After those gymnastics?
I think not.

20:19.900 --> 20:22.660
With these people? Really?

20:24.540 --> 20:26.460
I'm sorry, I know how that sounded.

20:27.500 --> 20:29.260
It's just, they're so...

20:30.620 --> 20:34.940
..I really want to say barmy,
but I know I'll get into trouble.

20:34.940 --> 20:38.580
It's no more barmy than
any other religion.

20:38.580 --> 20:43.460
I'm only trying to protect you.
You know nothing about this Kalon.

20:43.460 --> 20:45.580
I suspect that's not
even his real name.

20:45.580 --> 20:49.620
He...he's a great man.

20:49.620 --> 20:51.780
He has gift.

20:51.780 --> 20:55.140
I believe there's a rational
explanations for his gift.

20:55.140 --> 20:58.140
You believe what you want,
I'll believe what I want.

20:58.140 --> 21:00.060
What are you doing here?
Please leave, now.

21:05.180 --> 21:06.580
Dominique!

21:09.500 --> 21:12.740
It's locked. Dominique!

21:12.740 --> 21:15.140
I've got some spare keys
in the office, down the hallway,

21:15.140 --> 21:18.900
on the key rack. Dominique!
Please, please, hurry!

21:20.900 --> 21:22.140
Dominique.

21:34.980 --> 21:37.060
Dominique! Dominique, please.

21:43.140 --> 21:44.300
Dominique?

22:07.380 --> 22:10.220
So, you say there was no-one
in the room?

22:13.220 --> 22:14.980
No other way out?

22:16.180 --> 22:17.580
Unless the killer could fly.

22:22.140 --> 22:25.460
Mr...Kalon, is it?

22:28.220 --> 22:32.300
I'm sorry to ask this, but is there
any chance your wife could have...

22:35.060 --> 22:37.180
It was suicide?
Was she depressed?

22:39.020 --> 22:41.940
She was full of sunlight.
You ask anyone.

22:43.380 --> 22:46.620
We did hear her screaming for help.

22:46.620 --> 22:50.020
She didn't jump. She was pushed.

22:50.020 --> 22:52.460
She came flying out of window.

22:52.460 --> 22:55.940
But you didn't see anyone?
Inspector?

22:55.940 --> 22:57.780
That must be the master key.

23:10.260 --> 23:12.940
Right, let's see this room.

23:25.180 --> 23:28.500
Five-lever mortice,
near enough unpickable.

23:29.980 --> 23:32.580
Check with the groundskeepers
there's no other copies.

23:36.580 --> 23:39.100
Don't touch anything.

23:45.140 --> 23:46.180
Blood.

23:48.020 --> 23:50.380
There's no way anyone could have
hidden behind the door?

23:50.380 --> 23:52.380
Under the bed?

23:52.380 --> 23:53.820
No secret passages?

23:57.700 --> 23:59.900
Ah! More blood.

24:01.620 --> 24:05.060
I may be mistaken, but
I think that that is paint.

24:05.060 --> 24:09.340
Now, that on the other hand,
that is blood.

24:09.340 --> 24:12.900
I think we may deduce that she took
a bath to wash off the paint

24:12.900 --> 24:15.300
and then when whatever
happened, happened.

24:15.300 --> 24:18.500
Adam. Dominique's novice.
He's a painter.

24:19.540 --> 24:22.220
He has mental disturbances,
shell shock.

24:22.220 --> 24:24.700
That doesn't necessarily
mean he's a murderer.

24:24.700 --> 24:27.620
Sounds like a good place to start.

24:27.620 --> 24:30.140
No! Ah, Mr Watkins. I didn't do it.

24:31.220 --> 24:33.260
What are you doing?

24:33.260 --> 24:34.660
Unlock this door, now!

24:37.660 --> 24:39.140
Looks like we've found our man.

24:39.140 --> 24:41.140
< Officer!

24:41.140 --> 24:42.660
Perhaps.

24:46.700 --> 24:48.860
Well, he won't get very
far with that limp.

24:56.580 --> 24:58.580
Are you all right?

24:58.580 --> 25:01.900
She's in the light. I see her.

25:03.660 --> 25:05.180
She's at peace.

25:06.540 --> 25:07.900
She forgives.

25:33.980 --> 25:36.220
It was you. Calm down, Mr Watkins.

25:36.220 --> 25:38.540
You did it. How dare you?

25:38.540 --> 25:41.540
You wanted her out of the way
so you could.... Ask him.

25:41.540 --> 25:44.380
Ask him about the girls.
Lisa, Daisy, ask him!

25:44.380 --> 25:46.660
What's he talking about?
It's a private matter.

25:46.660 --> 25:48.060
Not today, I'm afraid.

25:50.100 --> 25:53.220
My Dominique had a morbid fear of
abandonment, which is not surprising,

25:53.220 --> 25:55.140
given her loss. But it
made her paranoid.

25:55.140 --> 25:56.860
She imagined relations. Imagined?

25:56.860 --> 25:58.380
Yes, imagined relations between

25:58.380 --> 26:01.060
myself and certain young women
in our community.

26:01.060 --> 26:03.700
I had to tell them to leave
for Dominique's peace of mind.

26:03.700 --> 26:06.300
He's lying! He's lying!
Besides, I was nowhere near her.

26:07.580 --> 26:09.700
And Father Brown can attest to that.

26:12.540 --> 26:14.220
Problem, Father Brown?

26:16.980 --> 26:19.900
Groundskeepers confirm
there are no other keys.

26:19.900 --> 26:24.340
Maybe Mr Watkins can enlighten us
to how he disappeared into thin air.

26:24.340 --> 26:27.460
When will you leave us to mourn?
Forensics are almost finished.

26:27.460 --> 26:29.700
Once we've taken statements,
we'll be off.

26:29.700 --> 26:33.300
But don't leave town.
Investigation's not over yet.

26:49.020 --> 26:51.900
You obviously have
something on your mind, Father.

26:51.900 --> 26:54.900
You let an innocent man
pay for your crime?

26:54.900 --> 26:58.340
Who of us is truly innocent?
Then you admit it.

27:02.780 --> 27:05.020
How did I do it?
Split myself in two?

27:05.020 --> 27:07.220
Well, I haven't fathomed out
the details yet.

27:07.220 --> 27:08.780
but I know the eyes of a murderer.

27:08.780 --> 27:11.100
I see, that's your proof,
is it? My eyes.

27:11.100 --> 27:13.180
Windows of the soul.

27:13.180 --> 27:15.700
Then look deeply.

27:15.700 --> 27:18.260
See that I won't let
anything or anyone

27:18.260 --> 27:20.740
get in the way of spreading
the word of the ancients.

27:20.740 --> 27:22.780
That's why you killed her.

27:23.820 --> 27:26.460
Because she stood in your way.

27:26.460 --> 27:28.580
You are not my confessor.

27:28.580 --> 27:32.900
Then tell me, what sort of a man

27:32.900 --> 27:35.540
covets another woman on the
day of his wife's murder?

27:36.900 --> 27:40.220
Finally, we get to what
this is really about.

27:41.660 --> 27:42.860
Jealousy.

27:44.100 --> 27:46.300
I understand you want her back.

27:46.300 --> 27:48.980
But know this - as surely
as night follows day,

27:48.980 --> 27:51.260
what happened to
Dominique was destiny.

27:51.260 --> 27:54.220
She made way for a
brighter spirit, a light

27:54.220 --> 27:57.140
so pure that it outshines even hers.

27:57.140 --> 28:00.700
And you will not have her.

28:03.020 --> 28:04.500
Now get off my property.

28:13.540 --> 28:17.460
Malcolm. Gather everyone.
I have an announcement.

28:24.500 --> 28:27.700
Father, I heard.
What an awful, hideous thing.

28:28.820 --> 28:32.780
I'll put the kettle on and
you can tell me all about it.

28:32.780 --> 28:36.420
Five-lever mortice lock.
Practically unpickable.

28:36.420 --> 28:39.140
No other keys. Which means what?

28:42.340 --> 28:44.460
He's been like this
since we left the manor.

28:44.460 --> 28:47.700
She started screaming
when we were in the garden.

28:49.980 --> 28:53.020
It's about 20 seconds
to the bedroom door.

28:55.100 --> 28:58.220
Father, I made you
a nice shepherd's pie.

28:58.220 --> 29:01.940
And I zipped through
all of Susie's chores.

29:01.940 --> 29:04.060
I have no idea what
takes her so long.

29:04.060 --> 29:08.580
Plus, I managed to
re-alphabetise all those files,

29:08.580 --> 29:12.300
and I still had time to bake some of
my award-winning strawberry scones.

29:12.300 --> 29:14.580
Files! We're going back.

29:19.900 --> 29:21.820
I hate it when he does that.

29:29.780 --> 29:30.980
You're glowing.

29:33.140 --> 29:34.820
Give us a moment, please, Rose.

29:41.700 --> 29:44.060
I want you to have this.

29:44.060 --> 29:46.580
Dominique wore it on her initiation.

29:46.580 --> 29:49.340
I...I couldn't. She wants you to.

29:54.940 --> 29:56.100
You're troubled.

30:00.140 --> 30:03.260
Zuzanna, what is that fear broiling
in the pit of your stomach?

30:03.260 --> 30:04.380
What's it about?

30:07.100 --> 30:08.260
Let me tell you.

30:10.780 --> 30:14.940
It is the fear of change,
of transformation.

30:17.780 --> 30:20.780
Allow yourself that feeling.

30:20.780 --> 30:24.140
Don't be afraid. Befriend it.

30:25.260 --> 30:26.820
Shake hands with it.

30:28.860 --> 30:30.420
Let it go.

30:53.780 --> 30:58.220
If Kalon won't tell us about those
girls, maybe something in here will.

31:01.620 --> 31:04.140
Where is everyone? Lisa...

31:06.540 --> 31:07.660
..and Daisy.

31:09.900 --> 31:11.780
Family records.

31:11.780 --> 31:13.580
Medical records.

31:15.540 --> 31:17.900
Dietary requirements.

31:19.020 --> 31:21.820
Nothing untoward. Now what?

31:38.100 --> 31:39.420
Wait a minute.

31:57.500 --> 31:58.900
They're leaving.

32:08.260 --> 32:09.860
Susie.

32:09.860 --> 32:12.540
What are you doing here?
Just listen, that's all I ask.

32:12.540 --> 32:16.060
If afterwards, you want to stay,
I won't stand in your way.

32:16.060 --> 32:18.780
I give you my word.
Adam was right about Kalon.

32:18.780 --> 32:21.060
And apparently,
he's a keen photographer.

32:21.060 --> 32:22.220
Got quite the collection.

32:25.860 --> 32:27.060
He's sick, Susie.

32:35.940 --> 32:37.740
He is sick?

32:37.740 --> 32:40.740
He? No.

32:40.740 --> 32:44.780
You are. Both of you.
But the proof's right there!

32:44.780 --> 32:46.180
You only see what you want.

32:48.060 --> 32:51.020
He captures our light.

32:51.020 --> 32:53.340
Our spirit.

32:53.340 --> 32:54.940
See?

32:54.940 --> 32:57.900
It's...it's not sick.

32:57.900 --> 32:59.820
It's beautiful.

32:59.820 --> 33:01.420
Susie, they're planning on leaving.

33:02.580 --> 33:05.420
I know. I go with them.

33:07.820 --> 33:09.580
You don't think that's suspicious?

33:10.740 --> 33:13.300
Would you like to live in
house where murder happened?

33:14.980 --> 33:17.820
It casts shadow.
Now she's talking like one of them.

33:19.020 --> 33:20.260
Susie, if you will abscond,

33:20.260 --> 33:22.260
Inspector Valentine
will definitely...

33:22.260 --> 33:26.500
He knows. They are charging Adam.
We are free to go.

33:28.700 --> 33:30.100
You said you'd leave.

33:32.100 --> 33:33.300
You gave your word.

33:34.660 --> 33:38.300
I did. How very touching.
Now let me show you the door.

33:44.700 --> 33:46.100
Goodbye, Father.

34:16.060 --> 34:19.300
She prefers my faith to yours.
Can you blame her?

34:53.460 --> 34:56.780
Zuzanna, the sun is setting
on your old life.

34:56.780 --> 35:00.340
Are you ready to be born anew? Yes.

35:00.340 --> 35:03.460
Do you open your heart to
the ancient astral ancestors?

35:04.460 --> 35:08.580
Do you embrace their wisdom?
Do you accept their truth?

35:08.580 --> 35:10.940
Yes. Then behold the light!

35:13.060 --> 35:18.820
By the power of the light,
the holy sun, I baptise you.

35:41.420 --> 35:44.620
Sounds to me like she's found her
calling and you just don't like it.

35:46.980 --> 35:50.780
We are deeply concerned
about her safety.

35:50.780 --> 35:53.500
The pros sols have the final say.
There's nothing I can do.

35:53.500 --> 35:55.220
Has he confessed?

35:55.220 --> 35:58.860
Mr Watkins was in love with the
victim. He's confessed to that.

35:58.860 --> 36:01.700
But not to murder? They rarely do.

36:01.700 --> 36:03.980
What about my suspicions
regarding the lock?

36:05.060 --> 36:08.100
They're suspicions,
not proof, not evidence.

36:09.260 --> 36:10.900
Come.

36:14.340 --> 36:16.100
Thanks, Sergeant.

36:19.300 --> 36:20.940
Is that the file on Kalon?

36:23.220 --> 36:26.060
I am not sharing police
information with you.

36:27.100 --> 36:29.260
Susie has been brainwashed.

36:31.220 --> 36:34.940
She is under the influence of what
I believe is a deeply disturbed man.

36:36.260 --> 36:39.340
The least you can do is give
us a chance to help her.

36:42.540 --> 36:43.940
Please.

36:48.660 --> 36:50.340
It's too early for all this.

36:50.340 --> 36:52.460
I'm going to get myself
a cup of coffee.

36:53.900 --> 36:57.340
I'll trust you not to touch
anything on my desk.

37:10.340 --> 37:11.980
Gerald Firth.

37:13.100 --> 37:16.780
He wasn't lying about his war
injury. Spent two months at a

37:16.780 --> 37:19.580
military hospital in Kent.
Bullet wound to the head.

37:19.580 --> 37:21.900
Most of that time, delirious,
paranoid delusions.

37:21.900 --> 37:24.060
Does that mean he's
a conman or he's just nuts?

37:24.060 --> 37:25.620
Well, I...

37:31.780 --> 37:34.620
What? What is it?

37:34.620 --> 37:36.540
I need to speak to Kalon. Now.

37:45.100 --> 37:48.500
They've gone. We've missed her!

38:00.020 --> 38:01.620
Perhaps not.

38:08.940 --> 38:14.460
The master bible. Written over
40 days and 40 nights.

38:14.460 --> 38:18.420
The wisdom of the ancients pouring
out of me in a ceaseless torrent.

38:21.380 --> 38:23.980
I don't usually allow
anyone to touch this.

38:40.340 --> 38:42.620
What is this?

38:42.620 --> 38:45.100
One last-ditch attempt
to vanquish me?

38:46.220 --> 38:47.940
Something along those lines, yes.

38:49.540 --> 38:52.060
What about the small matter
of your being my alibi?

38:54.620 --> 38:57.260
I'll deal with method.
Motive, first.

38:57.260 --> 38:59.860
Father, please. I'm sorry,
Susie. I have to do this.

38:59.860 --> 39:04.860
No, Zuzanna. Let us hear his
insinuations for the last time.

39:06.740 --> 39:08.900
Something happened
yesterday, did it not...

39:09.980 --> 39:12.380
that made Dominique realise that you

39:12.380 --> 39:15.220
would never change your
lecherous ways. Is that so?

39:16.740 --> 39:19.180
In all likelihood,
to do with Susie.

39:21.260 --> 39:27.380
Enough to make Dominique threaten
the thing you cared most about.

39:27.380 --> 39:30.740
The thing you told me yourself that
you would do anything to protect -

39:30.740 --> 39:33.500
your religion.
He's grasping at straws.

39:34.700 --> 39:38.060
What happened? What did she see?

39:38.060 --> 39:40.380
Spinning fantasies
out of thin air.

39:41.500 --> 39:44.780
From the moment you saw Susie,
you desired her.

39:45.860 --> 39:47.260
And Dominique knew that.

39:50.300 --> 39:54.140
Father, this is
becoming embarrassing.

39:54.140 --> 39:55.540
Susie?

40:00.180 --> 40:01.540
I remember.

40:14.420 --> 40:17.180
I didn't think of it at the time.

40:17.180 --> 40:19.460
That's because there was
nothing to think about.

40:28.420 --> 40:30.900
You went to Dominique's room, yes?

40:30.900 --> 40:32.740
No. Yes.

40:41.820 --> 40:44.100
Who is it? It's me.

40:56.740 --> 40:58.540
You argued with her.

41:00.060 --> 41:01.860
I just wanted to
capture her light.

41:01.860 --> 41:04.900
What? Like the others?
Dominique, please. It's over.

41:06.780 --> 41:09.260
Meaning? Meaning, by the
time I'm finished with you,

41:09.260 --> 41:11.060
you won't have a penny to your name.

41:11.060 --> 41:14.740
You'll be ridiculed as a
lecherous crank. You disgust me.

41:16.340 --> 41:17.940
Why?

41:19.940 --> 41:23.700
The blood on the rug was from
the first time you hit her.

41:25.060 --> 41:28.020
The blood on the door
of the bathroom

41:28.020 --> 41:30.420
was when you tried to make
it look like an accident.

41:32.460 --> 41:36.060
From far-fetched to outlandish!

41:36.060 --> 41:37.820
I haven't even started yet.

41:39.140 --> 41:42.340
Because she wasn't dead, was she?

41:46.540 --> 41:49.340
Your plan to discover her
corpse was thwarted...

41:51.540 --> 41:53.220
..when she started screaming.

41:56.700 --> 42:00.540
So you did the only thing possible,
you feigned a locked door.

42:00.540 --> 42:04.020
It's locked. There are spare keys
in the office down the hallway,

42:04.020 --> 42:07.460
on the key rack. Please hurry!
Dominique! Please.

42:09.540 --> 42:13.700
And when I went to fetch the
spare key, you dashed in...

42:16.020 --> 42:18.100
..you threw her out of a window.

42:25.860 --> 42:27.780
Dominique! Dominique, please.

42:32.540 --> 42:35.620
Pure...showmanship.

42:35.620 --> 42:39.420
No, no, no, he just wants you
for himself. He's jealous.

42:39.420 --> 42:41.140
Susie. Zuzanna.

42:48.460 --> 42:50.540
Admit it.

42:52.340 --> 42:55.820
One man of faith to another.
Unburden yourself.

42:55.820 --> 42:58.700
Why? So you can arrest me?
I only care about your soul.

42:58.700 --> 43:01.060
Then, you of all people, should
understand that this was

43:01.060 --> 43:03.700
meant it be, it was ordained.
The astral spirits...

43:03.700 --> 43:07.460
There are no astral spirits!

43:07.460 --> 43:10.220
Says the man who believes
in virgin births.

43:12.980 --> 43:14.780
Sorry.

43:30.260 --> 43:34.420
That's you, Gerald.
That's not my name. But it is.

43:36.100 --> 43:37.900
It says so, there.

43:39.700 --> 43:41.060
Look at the doctor...

43:42.780 --> 43:44.220
..what he's wearing.

43:46.540 --> 43:49.260
It's the last piece of the puzzle
that's been nagging away at me

43:49.260 --> 43:50.620
since you first arrived.

43:52.020 --> 43:56.660
I saw plenty of those when
I was a chaplain in the army,

43:56.660 --> 43:58.860
but I never put it
together until now.

44:00.980 --> 44:03.940
You incorporated the
stethoscope into your fantasy.

44:07.740 --> 44:12.580
It became the symbol that the astral
aliens planted in your brain.

44:12.580 --> 44:14.220
No.

44:14.220 --> 44:15.660
Yes.

44:15.660 --> 44:17.340
Proof.

44:20.820 --> 44:23.380
You were in a terrible place.

44:23.380 --> 44:26.020
Broken. Helpless. Lost.

44:26.020 --> 44:28.780
You needed a refuge.

44:28.780 --> 44:31.180
And you created this.

44:31.180 --> 44:33.780
You dare to come into
my house of worship

44:33.780 --> 44:37.140
and tell me that my god is false?

44:37.140 --> 44:45.140
SHOUTING: No. No.
No! No! No! No! Nooo!

44:47.140 --> 44:50.900
Oh, God, Dominique. Dominique.

44:50.900 --> 44:54.780
I'm sorry!

44:54.780 --> 44:56.980
I'm so sorry!

45:17.060 --> 45:21.420
Do you have anywhere to stay?
Think I might just wander a while.

45:24.900 --> 45:28.620
Name of a local hostel and
if you ever need to talk at all,

45:28.620 --> 45:30.300
I will be in St Mary's.

45:37.500 --> 45:40.060
Mr Firth? Quiet as a church mouse.

45:43.620 --> 45:45.180
How'd you know his real name?

45:46.780 --> 45:50.460
Don't know. Must've
read it somewhere.

45:58.900 --> 46:00.620
Cup of tea?

46:02.900 --> 46:06.460
I prefer to be alone. Thank you.

46:07.780 --> 46:09.420
I will see you tomorrow.

46:26.300 --> 46:27.620
Mind if I join you?

46:35.460 --> 46:36.780
All I have left.

46:38.660 --> 46:42.420
I try to picture their faces.
But they slip away.

46:42.420 --> 46:46.020
Maybe the trick is not to try.
Let them come to you.

46:47.100 --> 46:48.780
I just wanted to talk to them.

46:50.940 --> 46:52.540
You don't need Kalon for that.

46:54.900 --> 46:58.980
Carry them in your heart, and you
can talk to them whenever you want.

47:01.220 --> 47:04.100
You can talk to me.
I'm always here.

47:06.980 --> 47:10.180
Time for elevenses. I have chores.

47:10.180 --> 47:12.740
Scones first. Chores later.

47:14.180 --> 47:18.740
Tea and award-winning strawberry
scones. What could be better?

47:18.740 --> 47:22.940
Rumour has it you pinched your
scone recipe from Mrs O'Boyle.

47:22.940 --> 47:25.820
You wash your mouth out
with soap, Sid Carter.

47:25.820 --> 47:28.820
Just saying what I heard.
I heard same thing.

47:28.820 --> 47:32.300
Well, I'll have that back, then.
And yours, too.
