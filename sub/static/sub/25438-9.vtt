00:06.464 --> 00:10.093
-[Ruth] Wait! What is this? Is this real?
-[Justine] Yeah, seriously!

00:10.176 --> 00:13.930
-[Ruth] This is real curriculum?
-[Justine] Yes, it's "Family Living."

00:14.014 --> 00:17.726
[laughs] "Family living?" That's a class?

00:17.809 --> 00:19.686
Oh, yeah. And it's mandatory.

00:19.769 --> 00:22.981
They make you get fake-married
and take care of a plant

00:23.064 --> 00:24.858
and make a household budget.

00:24.941 --> 00:27.736
-God, I miss high school.
-[Justine] It's regressive bullshit.

00:27.819 --> 00:31.781
There's more girls than guys in the class,
so they gave every husband two wives.

00:31.865 --> 00:33.867
Ooh! Teen polygamy!

00:33.950 --> 00:36.911
And now I gotta meet with her teacher
because she's failing this class

00:36.995 --> 00:38.747
that shouldn't exist in the first place.

00:38.830 --> 00:42.125
I'm not failing. I'm getting a D.
In protest.

00:42.250 --> 00:44.044
Oh, right. Right.

00:46.046 --> 00:47.338
Oh, I can help clean up.

00:47.422 --> 00:48.882
-No.
-[Justine] You can barely walk.

00:49.090 --> 00:51.092
[chuckles]

00:54.345 --> 00:56.347
Thanks for inviting me to family dinner.

00:56.431 --> 00:59.476
Oh, it was Justine's idea.
I think she wanted a buffer.

00:59.559 --> 01:05.190
Well, it's a nice way to spend
our last night before our last week.

01:07.734 --> 01:10.445
Can't believe families do this
every night, right?

01:10.528 --> 01:11.362
[laughs]

01:11.446 --> 01:14.324
Oh, Justine, I left two dresses
in your room from Jenny.

01:14.407 --> 01:15.992
You need to pick one
for Winter Formal.

01:16.451 --> 01:20.038
I'm not getting dressed up.
Billy and I are going ironically.

01:22.123 --> 01:22.957
What?

01:23.500 --> 01:24.793
You're back together with Billy?

01:25.960 --> 01:26.878
We never broke up.

01:33.218 --> 01:35.970
[Ruth] I'm gonna leave those dresses here
in case you change your mind.

01:36.054 --> 01:37.555
[Justine] I won't. Good night.

01:37.764 --> 01:39.516
[Ruth inhales sharply] Night.

01:40.350 --> 01:41.267
[door closes]

01:41.392 --> 01:44.270
-All right, all right, all right.
-[laughing]

01:46.689 --> 01:48.024
-Okay?
-Thanks.

01:53.863 --> 01:57.450
-[Sam] Whoa. You made it...
-[chuckles]

01:58.201 --> 01:59.494
-...to the couch.
-[groans]

02:02.080 --> 02:04.916
[sighs] Can you give me a ride back?

02:04.999 --> 02:09.129
I don't know. Only if you're comfortable
with a very tired drunk driver.

02:09.921 --> 02:11.840
You know what?
Why don't you just stay here?

02:11.923 --> 02:15.885
I can kick Justine out of the guest room.
She can sleep outside.

02:15.969 --> 02:17.387
-[Ruth] No! [laughs]
-And you can...

02:17.470 --> 02:19.806
I'm good with the couch.
See? I'm already here.

02:19.889 --> 02:20.723
[Sam] Yeah?

02:23.268 --> 02:26.688
I'm gonna just put these away,
get this going.

02:26.771 --> 02:27.981
[laughs]

02:28.106 --> 02:29.691
[Sam] Now it's pretty good. Oh, wait.

02:33.862 --> 02:34.737
[sighs]

02:36.781 --> 02:38.283
Yeah, this-- this is better.

02:38.908 --> 02:40.743
[Ruth] Thank you.

Justine! Turn down the fucking music!

02:58.136 --> 03:00.013
[Justine] It's not that loud!

03:00.096 --> 03:02.807
[Sam] Sounds like someone's being murdered

03:13.860 --> 03:16.279
Would it kill you to put out
a decent continental breakfast?

03:16.654 --> 03:18.156
Or at least give us cups?

03:19.240 --> 03:22.410
It's beautiful muffin meal.

03:23.912 --> 03:28.208
I'll give you cups

09:13.219 --> 09:15.763
Ah! You gave it to me.

09:16.055 --> 09:19.141
So I could have sex. I did not have sex,
so the deal is off.

09:19.475 --> 09:21.811
You're just jealous
because I have a boyfriend.

09:21.936 --> 09:24.564
Ooh, I'm gonna find out
when you work at The Limited.

09:24.647 --> 09:27.441
I'm gonna go there,
and I'm gonna try on everything.

09:27.525 --> 09:30.361
Actually, Jenny, maybe I will grab one
of those applications.

09:30.444 --> 09:31.445
Yes!

09:31.529 --> 09:34.407
Oh, my God! If you work
at The Limited, and we work at the salon,

09:34.490 --> 09:36.993
-we'll all be working at the mall!
-We can eat at the food court!

09:37.076 --> 09:37.910
Yes!

09:38.077 --> 09:40.121
Um, I can't answer this first question.

09:40.913 --> 09:42.164
You don't know your name?

09:42.248 --> 09:46.210
-No! What's a Social Security number?
-You don't have a Social Security number?

09:46.294 --> 09:48.462
How are you even working, like, right now?

09:48.546 --> 09:51.048
Well, what info did you put
on the paperwork for the show?

09:51.132 --> 09:53.175
Uh, I think I just left that part blank.

09:53.259 --> 09:54.927
-Rhonda.
-[laughs] Rhonda.

09:55.011 --> 09:57.388
You guys, it's fine. Okay?

09:57.471 --> 09:59.932
I'm just...
I'm a little bit "off the grid," you know?

10:00.016 --> 10:01.392
-Oh, try "illegal."
-Mm-hmm.

10:01.475 --> 10:03.019
Did you kill someone in England?

10:03.102 --> 10:05.104
I just like it here. I want to stay.

10:05.229 --> 10:08.149
You need to go to the British Consulate
or whatever

10:08.232 --> 10:10.151
and, like, get a visa.
My uncle Timmy did it,

10:10.234 --> 10:13.404
and he barely speaks English.
Now he owns, like, four doughnut shops.

10:13.696 --> 10:17.033
Hmm, I don't know. I've gotten this far
without an American ID.

10:17.408 --> 10:18.659
I got this job, didn't I?

10:18.993 --> 10:21.078
Not everyone's as dumb as Bash.

10:21.162 --> 10:24.290
The Limited is serious, okay?
It's a very well-run company.

10:24.457 --> 10:25.708
You're gonna need ID.

10:25.791 --> 10:28.294
Just go! Just go to the consulate.
It's gonna take, like, an hour.

10:28.377 --> 10:29.295
Yeah.

10:29.420 --> 10:32.923
Fine! I really think you people are making
too big a deal over this.

10:33.758 --> 10:35.551
Americans love British people.

10:36.218 --> 10:38.012
They love us! We get exceptions.

10:38.095 --> 10:39.764
[in British accent] Hello!
I'd like a visa.

10:39.847 --> 10:43.059
-I've worn my gold suit to the consulate.

with his own.

10:48.272 --> 10:49.899
How many times have you seen this movie?

10:49.982 --> 10:52.943
Oh, Florian and I saw it, like, four times
in theaters as my research

10:53.027 --> 10:54.028
for my life in the arts.

10:54.111 --> 10:56.739
Anyway, so-- so the rats are
underneath the table,

-Packing up.
-Why? What's going on?

28:11.439 --> 28:13.858
I took your great advice,
and I went to the consulate.

28:13.942 --> 28:15.360
They sent me
to the immigration office,

28:15.443 --> 28:17.362
and now I have 30 days
to leave the country!

Oh, sweetie! We'll go back
with you tomorrow and we'll fix it.

28:24.494 --> 28:26.371
You can't! I'm on the records.

28:26.579 --> 28:29.124
Okay? [sighs]
I can't believe I listened to you guys!

28:29.708 --> 28:32.419
I was getting by just fine by myself,
like I always do.

28:33.169 --> 28:36.715
And now, I have to go back
to my alcoholic parents

28:36.965 --> 28:39.926
in Bromley and have frizzy hair
and be miserable!

28:44.556 --> 28:46.558

No! I mean, yes, perfect solution,
and no, I don't have a better idea,

28:58.570 --> 28:59.988
but fucking no! No!

you've been really consistent, and...

31:08.283 --> 31:13.663
I know that "consistent and nice"
just sounds boring and that's just...

It's like something you say
when you don't like someone's face,

31:17.000 --> 31:17.834
but I do...

31:18.626 --> 31:19.460
like your face.

31:20.795 --> 31:25.508
I know I should have said something
like this weeks ago, but I just...

31:26.175 --> 31:28.720
All this crap got in the way,
and then I... [stammers]

I have these stupid crutches,
