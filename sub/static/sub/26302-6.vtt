WEBVTT

00:01.569 --> 00:03.737
-The Lyons are
hitting back on Empire.
-(shouts)

00:03.771 --> 00:06.174
-May we rise.
-Like we always do.

00:06.207 --> 00:08.076
Catch all-new episodes
Wednesdays.

00:08.109 --> 00:10.211
And check out
our other Fox programs--

00:10.244 --> 00:13.081
Star, 9-1-1, and The Resident.

00:13.114 --> 00:14.215
That's a win-win.

00:14.248 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:18.619 --> 00:20.354
-Previously on Empire...
-Do y'all remember the three

00:20.388 --> 00:21.989
-black divas? They are back!
-(applause and cheering)

00:22.022 --> 00:24.692
-Please marry me. I love you.
-(crying): I love you.

00:24.725 --> 00:27.595
-How do you know I'm adopted?
-I know your real mom.

00:27.628 --> 00:29.863
I was in prison with her.

00:29.897 --> 00:32.500
-You're all screwed up,
and you need help.
-You can be strong.

00:32.533 --> 00:34.368
Look, you ain't got to do it
for me. Do it for your babies.

00:34.402 --> 00:36.237
Oh, you ain't care about my baby
when you killed their mother.

00:36.270 --> 00:38.172
Yo, when I heard
that Blake wrote...

00:38.206 --> 00:40.941
Blake wrote? So you told her
you wrote my song, brah?

00:40.974 --> 00:42.943
-(groans)
-(gasping)

00:42.976 --> 00:45.513
(intro
to "Moment of Silence" plays)

00:45.546 --> 00:48.382
* Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah *

00:48.416 --> 00:51.018
* Yeah

00:51.051 --> 00:54.188
-* Uh-huh
-* Yeah, yeah, yeah *

00:54.222 --> 00:57.024
* When they fire that shot,
then the body drop *

00:57.057 --> 00:58.926
* Drop, drop

00:58.959 --> 01:01.129
* We need a moment of silence

01:01.162 --> 01:03.097
* Silence, silence, silence *

01:03.131 --> 01:04.932
-* Yeah, yeah *
-* Silence, silence

01:04.965 --> 01:08.602
* Yeah, when you sitting on top
and they want ya spot *

01:08.636 --> 01:10.604
-(gunshot)
-* Then the music stop

01:10.638 --> 01:12.373
* We need a moment of silence

01:12.406 --> 01:14.375
* Silence, silence, silence *

01:14.408 --> 01:17.411
* Yeah, yeah, yeah,
silence, silence, silence *

01:17.445 --> 01:20.214
* I get up from the dust,
it's no love, it's no trust *

01:20.248 --> 01:22.583
* If you wait, come with us,
it's just me and my blood... *

01:22.616 --> 01:25.153
Yeah, you want a midnight snack?
Huh?

01:25.186 --> 01:26.954
I'll bring the Cookie,
you bring the milk.

01:26.987 --> 01:28.422
-Are you serious?
-(laughs)

01:28.456 --> 01:30.057
-Mm-hmm.
-(laughs)

01:30.090 --> 01:32.626
Uh-oh. Wait a minute. Why
it smell like a barn in here?

01:32.660 --> 01:34.595
And why does that boy look
like his ass stink?

01:34.628 --> 01:36.464
-How long y'all been down here?
-No, no. We've been

01:36.497 --> 01:39.167
at it long enough
for our boy to realize

01:39.200 --> 01:41.569
that monster
that lives in him is back.

01:41.602 --> 01:44.004
* Messed around and survived,
don't wanna... *

01:44.037 --> 01:46.006
He has found himself.
I mean, do you remember

01:46.039 --> 01:47.441
when I stayed in the studio,

01:47.475 --> 01:49.343
-it was, like, 72 hours, right?
-Mm-hmm.

01:49.377 --> 01:51.179
Trying to do two albums.

01:51.212 --> 01:53.847
What I was doing
is what he's doing.

01:53.881 --> 01:55.916
I was exorcising my demons.

01:55.949 --> 01:57.851
He's getting it out of him now.

01:57.885 --> 02:00.020
You know?
Let him stay in there

02:00.053 --> 02:02.423
and you can save me a little bit
of that for later.

02:02.456 --> 02:04.358
No. What he needs

02:04.392 --> 02:07.195
to exercise, Lucious,
is a washcloth,

02:07.228 --> 02:09.963
-and he needs some sleep,
Lucious.
-Baby...

02:09.997 --> 02:11.432
Don't "baby" me.

02:11.465 --> 02:14.202
This is a family business,

02:14.235 --> 02:16.003
so I expect you
to take care of our son.

02:16.036 --> 02:17.338
-Hey...
-Forget that,

02:17.371 --> 02:19.607
then you can forget about these,

02:19.640 --> 02:21.875
and you can forget
about this for sure.

02:21.909 --> 02:23.444
-Can't forget that.
-No.

02:23.477 --> 02:24.878
-It's unforgettable.
-Clean this place up.

02:24.912 --> 02:27.615
* When you sitting on top
and they want ya spot *

02:27.648 --> 02:29.817
-* Stop, stop *
-* Then the music stop

02:29.850 --> 02:31.785
* We need a moment of silence

02:31.819 --> 02:33.954
* I do... *

02:33.987 --> 02:35.889
*

02:40.994 --> 02:43.897
COOKIE: Did you know that,
with new medical advances,

02:43.931 --> 02:46.334
somebody with HIV will probably

02:46.367 --> 02:49.303
live longer than someone
with type 2 diabetes?

02:49.337 --> 02:50.838
Isn't that interesting?

02:50.871 --> 02:53.073
You know something else
you didn't know?

02:53.106 --> 02:56.510
If Jamal thought
Kai needed your help,

02:56.544 --> 02:58.546
I think he would ask you.

02:58.579 --> 03:00.748
Our son loves this man,

03:00.781 --> 03:02.816
for real, okay,

03:02.850 --> 03:04.852
and I don't want to be ignorant

03:04.885 --> 03:06.687
to what Kai might be
going through,

03:06.720 --> 03:08.389
so I'm educating myself, okay?

03:08.422 --> 03:10.391
So why don't you just trust him?

03:10.424 --> 03:12.360
You know, maybe then
you don't have to worry so much.

03:12.393 --> 03:13.994
That's all I'm saying.

03:14.027 --> 03:16.096
Well, what about all the artists
we should have signed,

03:16.129 --> 03:17.998
like, yesterday?
Can I worry about that?

03:18.031 --> 03:22.002
Well, we just signed Devon
to Def Jam, and...

03:22.035 --> 03:23.771
And we're about
to lose everything

03:23.804 --> 03:26.006
if we don't get
any more cash flowing

03:26.039 --> 03:28.942
through this brand-new company,
Lucious.

03:28.976 --> 03:31.111
Baby, will you please relax?

03:31.144 --> 03:33.013
Your man is doing his part.

03:33.046 --> 03:35.849
Thirsty's on his way over here
right now,

03:35.883 --> 03:39.953
and we're finalizing our plans
to get Carlito

03:39.987 --> 03:43.557
-under Lyon Family Management.
-Mm.

03:43.591 --> 03:45.859
That's real cash right away.

03:45.893 --> 03:49.863
I will still probably
sign someone faster than you.

03:49.897 --> 03:51.765
Hmm?

03:51.799 --> 03:53.367
Mmm.

03:53.401 --> 03:55.369
Is that a challenge?

03:55.403 --> 03:57.438
Whoever brings in
the first artist

03:57.471 --> 04:00.974
gets on top tonight.

04:01.008 --> 04:02.676
(laughs)

04:04.812 --> 04:06.747
(door opening)

04:09.016 --> 04:12.486
Carlito's manager plays
in a high-stake poker game

04:12.520 --> 04:15.155
every Wednesday,
and he's damn good.

04:15.188 --> 04:17.090
But word on the street--
he's on the tilt.

04:17.124 --> 04:18.592
How does that help me?

04:18.626 --> 04:20.394
He's got a bit of
a gambling problem.

04:20.428 --> 04:22.630
Cleaned out his bank account,
mortgaged his home, everything.

04:22.663 --> 04:24.498
-Everything except...
-Carlito.

04:24.532 --> 04:26.634
Exactly.

04:26.667 --> 04:29.403
You got to get me a seat
at that table, man.

04:29.437 --> 04:31.104
Already done.

04:31.138 --> 04:33.106
Thurston Rawlings.

04:33.140 --> 04:35.776
Before we get the accolades
going, there is a catch.

04:35.809 --> 04:38.078
The game got
a half-a-million-dollar buy-in.

04:38.111 --> 04:40.280
Blinds are 250 and 500.

04:40.314 --> 04:42.916
(exhales)

04:42.950 --> 04:45.653
I'm gonna assume you ain't got
that kind of money lying around?

04:45.686 --> 04:47.621
Yeah. Damn.

04:53.561 --> 04:56.296
What good is a little poker...

04:56.330 --> 05:00.033
without a little bluffing?

05:05.873 --> 05:10.010
* I'm not awake *

05:10.043 --> 05:11.812
-* I'm not alone... *
-(snoring)

05:11.845 --> 05:14.348
You're snoring... again.

05:14.382 --> 05:16.350
Pretty sure I wasn't.

05:16.384 --> 05:19.387
-(sighs)
-Heavy breathing, however,
guaranteed.

05:19.420 --> 05:21.789
Uh-uh, come on.

05:21.822 --> 05:23.657
(laughing):
Hey, get up.

05:23.691 --> 05:26.159
We've been loved up in this
damn apartment for three days.

05:26.193 --> 05:28.396
(sighs)

05:28.429 --> 05:30.964
"So when you asking him?"
(laughs)

05:30.998 --> 05:33.634
I told you your mom was gonna
Meghan Markle our wedding plans.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.569
-(phone chimes)
-No, this is Becky.

05:35.603 --> 05:38.205
She's just...
confirming tonight.

05:38.238 --> 05:39.707
(Jamal sighs)

05:39.740 --> 05:41.241
Sure you don't want to cancel?

05:41.274 --> 05:44.177
Uh, no.
Even when I was in London,

05:44.211 --> 05:47.147
I didn't cancel
our FaceTime dates.

05:47.180 --> 05:49.182
Cannot start now.

05:49.216 --> 05:51.585
You're engaged.

05:51.619 --> 05:53.987
Might be time
for some new rules?

05:54.021 --> 05:57.925
New rule--
don't be looking at me

05:57.958 --> 06:00.394
-like that when I'm trying
to explain something.
-Fine.

06:00.428 --> 06:03.196
One hour.
If she's still here,

06:03.230 --> 06:06.266
when I get back,
I'm getting buck-ass naked,

06:06.299 --> 06:08.736
-Hey.
-getting my man and we are going

06:08.769 --> 06:11.004
back to bed.

06:11.038 --> 06:13.607
-All right,
you put it like that...
-Yeah.

06:13.641 --> 06:15.075
-(applause and cheering)
-COOKIE: All right, here we go.

06:15.108 --> 06:17.177
Hey, everybody. Yes!

06:17.210 --> 06:19.112
Good job putting this together,
Porsha.

06:19.146 --> 06:22.616
I see you!
I'm gonna see what you got, too.

06:22.650 --> 06:26.386
Girl, this turnout is
everything. I see you!

06:26.420 --> 06:28.388
Yes, we're gonna sign somebody
in here.

06:28.422 --> 06:31.258
They're ready to perform.
Let's get this over with.

06:31.291 --> 06:32.693
Okay.
Got your speech for the crowd.

06:32.726 --> 06:34.628
Child, I know how
to talk to the people.

06:34.662 --> 06:37.731
-All right, y'all, listen up.
-(applause and cheering)

06:37.765 --> 06:39.467
Here we go.

06:39.500 --> 06:42.235
Five boroughs in five days,
and we gonna start right here--

06:42.269 --> 06:45.205
that's right--
in Harlem's Riverside Park.

06:45.238 --> 06:48.476
Why? Because Lyon
Family Management is looking

06:48.509 --> 06:50.544
for artists
that got something to say.

06:50.578 --> 06:53.647
And we know we can find it
right here in these streets.

06:53.681 --> 06:56.316
-(applause and cheering)
-That's right.

06:56.349 --> 06:59.152
So I want you
to hear me when I say this.

07:01.254 --> 07:03.824
You don't need everybody
to believe in you.

07:03.857 --> 07:07.094
All you need is one somebody.

07:07.127 --> 07:09.396
And she's standing right here
in front of you.

07:09.429 --> 07:11.331
(applause and cheering)

07:12.199 --> 07:13.166
Cookie, I love you!

07:13.200 --> 07:16.303
So bring it!

07:16.336 --> 07:18.305
* Addicted to ballin' *

07:18.338 --> 07:20.641
* I have to get my cash

07:20.674 --> 07:24.277
* The money is callin', got
bands, got bands, got bands *

07:24.311 --> 07:26.113
* I'm addicted to ballin' *

07:26.146 --> 07:29.116
* I, I, I, I, I, I, I... *

07:29.149 --> 07:31.852
All right, the money's all there
and window clean.

07:31.885 --> 07:34.187
Y'all don't have to secure it
to the back first?

07:34.221 --> 07:36.990
-No, we're good.
-It's all there.

07:37.024 --> 07:39.192
-Nathan...
-Yes.

07:39.226 --> 07:42.029
-Thank you, baby.
-You got it, man.

07:43.063 --> 07:45.032
MOVER:
All the way.

07:45.065 --> 07:46.634
All right,
look, not for nothing,

07:46.667 --> 07:47.801
but can you really play?

07:47.835 --> 07:49.970
I mean, if I remember correctly,

07:50.003 --> 07:52.806
that Derrick Adams was
a wedding gift to Cookie.

07:52.840 --> 07:57.110
Man, this cat's been handling
art transactions for years.

07:57.144 --> 07:59.346
He... He'll... He's gonna
keep it on the shelf.

07:59.379 --> 08:01.982
Get this back before
Cookie even knows it's gone.

08:02.015 --> 08:05.185
Tell me about this poker game,
man.

08:05.218 --> 08:07.287
THIRSTY:
At the old Hampton estate,

08:07.320 --> 08:10.490
each guest shall be met by
Miss Shelby. She runs the game.

08:10.524 --> 08:12.359
The evening guests shall be...

08:12.392 --> 08:14.695
the easiest mark in the room,
Dr. Dave Smith,

08:14.728 --> 08:16.864
Maureen Lowenstein,

08:16.897 --> 08:18.966
revolutionized hedge-funding
in the late eighties.

08:18.999 --> 08:21.134
Then we got Vincent Green,
Hollywood heartthrob

08:21.168 --> 08:22.570
turned world-class
poker player.

08:22.603 --> 08:24.805
Nikolay Stanislaski,

08:24.838 --> 08:27.741
father of the New York
Chechen Mafia. Enough said.

08:27.775 --> 08:30.343
Karl Binyan, Carlito's manager.
We get Binyan in the red,

08:30.377 --> 08:32.580
he'll be forced
to put Carlito in the pot.

08:33.781 --> 08:37.585
-Any questions?
-Yeah.

08:37.618 --> 08:39.252
Think I need a new suit?

08:45.525 --> 08:47.561
-Thank you. Thank you.
-You can go.
-Oh.

08:47.595 --> 08:49.563
We'll-we'll call you.

08:49.597 --> 08:52.733
Only if this next one
got a blip of talent.

08:52.766 --> 08:54.101
Oh, trust.
He's got mad flow.

08:54.134 --> 08:55.769
Uh, well, how in the hell
would you know?

08:55.803 --> 08:57.571
'Cause it runs in the family.
This my play cousin.

08:57.605 --> 08:59.039
Oh, Porsha, look,
ain't nobody got time

08:59.072 --> 09:00.440
for your play nepotism.

09:00.473 --> 09:03.376
Really, Cookie Lyon,
mother of Andre,

09:03.410 --> 09:05.212
Jamal and Hakeem Lyon?

09:05.245 --> 09:07.380
Eh. What is your name,
young man?

09:07.414 --> 09:09.750
-I go by Big City.
-Mm-hmm.

09:09.783 --> 09:11.284
Why so nervous, Big Town?

09:11.318 --> 09:13.186
It's Big City,
and you'd be nervous, too,

09:13.220 --> 09:15.723
if Cookie Lyon is staring
you down. Now give us a chance.

09:15.756 --> 09:18.225
-Us?
-Yes. He needs
an introduction, okay?

09:19.827 --> 09:22.095
* Let me go ahead
and introduce the kid *

09:22.129 --> 09:25.265

09:53.827 --> 09:55.162
* Redd Foxx.

09:55.195 --> 09:58.098
-Yeah.
-Wow. Yeah. Just... wow.

09:58.131 --> 09:59.633
-Yeah.
-Hey, all right.

09:59.667 --> 10:01.268
Well, Porsha, first of all,
I didn't know

10:01.301 --> 10:03.270
you had it in you, girl.
(chuckles)

10:03.303 --> 10:04.672
Well, not me. I'm just reppin'
for my boy Big City.

10:04.705 --> 10:06.239
I'm talking about him.

10:06.273 --> 10:08.241
Yeah, see, that's why I don't
give your ass compliments,

10:08.275 --> 10:10.678
'cause you don't know how to
just shut up and say thank you.

10:10.711 --> 10:13.480
Okay, thank you. And my boy--
what you think?

10:13.513 --> 10:16.083
You got the skills. You just
don't have the confidence

10:16.116 --> 10:18.151
to go with it, but you...
you on your way.

10:18.185 --> 10:21.755
I'm gonna need you to drop some
mix tapes, hit a couple clubs.

10:21.789 --> 10:24.091
-Respect, queen, respect.
-Yes, you do that, baby.

10:24.124 --> 10:25.525
You come back and see me.

10:25.558 --> 10:29.262
-Keep plugging.
-You did good. You got this.
-Okay.

10:29.296 --> 10:31.364
-Hello.
-Are you...?

10:31.398 --> 10:32.332
Uh, no cutsies.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.770
You sure
you're in the right place?

10:36.804 --> 10:38.706
If you're Cookie Lyon, I am.

10:38.739 --> 10:40.207
I'm Elizabeth Landry.

10:41.675 --> 10:43.210
Maya's mom.

10:47.380 --> 10:49.717

10:49.750 --> 10:52.886
-* You ready?
-* Looking for somebody

10:52.920 --> 10:55.222
* That's single for the night *

10:55.255 --> 10:57.858
* We don't need nobody *

10:57.891 --> 11:00.627
-* Just you by my side
-* Just you *

11:00.660 --> 11:03.230
* 'Cause you got that body *

11:03.263 --> 11:05.833

11:05.866 --> 11:08.335

11:08.368 --> 11:10.303
* It's cool, I don't mind *

11:10.337 --> 11:13.206
-* Can you shake it le-e-eft? *
-* Can you?

11:13.240 --> 11:15.909

11:18.511 --> 11:20.047

11:20.080 --> 11:21.681
-* And I brought my ride
-* Come bring me *

11:21.715 --> 11:23.383
-* That good, good love *
-* Your love

11:23.416 --> 11:25.685
-* And I'll do the same *
-* The same

11:25.719 --> 11:27.687
* Just drop that
duh-duh-duh-duh *

11:27.721 --> 11:30.257
-* Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh
-* You know why I came... *

11:30.290 --> 11:35.662
Becky, I'm telling you,
this is going to be a hit.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.430
I'm taking it to
Essence Fest this summer.

11:37.464 --> 11:39.733
Now, I know that I got us
kicked out of Essence Fest,

11:39.767 --> 11:41.434
but I did not get us
banned for life.

11:41.468 --> 11:42.870
GISELLE: You tried
to take your tube top off.

11:42.903 --> 11:44.704
Come in here.

11:44.738 --> 11:46.573
-* That's just how we live *
-* Yeah, yeah *

11:46.606 --> 11:48.208
GISELLE:
You hear this?

11:48.241 --> 11:50.878
-* I'll kiss all your wounds *
-So dope.

11:50.911 --> 11:52.880
* Make you feel
invincible tonight *

11:52.913 --> 11:55.182
* Take off that wardrobe

11:55.215 --> 11:57.217
* Take off all those fancy...

11:57.250 --> 11:59.519
-Oh, hey.
-(vocalizing melody)

11:59.552 --> 12:01.088
Let's take five, guys.

12:04.724 --> 12:07.394
So, the Three Bland Decrepits

12:07.427 --> 12:08.962
-are a thing of the past.
-(scoffs)

12:08.996 --> 12:10.931
Please stop chasing yesterday.

12:10.964 --> 12:12.565
I'm sorry, are you serious?

12:12.599 --> 12:13.801
Are you not hearing
what we hear?

12:13.834 --> 12:14.968
What Becky is trying
to say, Jeff...

12:15.002 --> 12:17.905
You know what?
Uh-uh, sis.

12:17.938 --> 12:20.273
Becky just said exactly what
Becky was trying to say.

12:21.741 --> 12:23.543
-I'm gonna go cool down.
-Okay.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.645
Take a minute, Becky.

12:25.678 --> 12:28.315
-Jeff...
-Giselle, I feel like
a broken record.

12:28.348 --> 12:31.952
The data shows that TBD can
never make as much as they cost.

12:31.985 --> 12:33.286
Well, they would if they had

12:33.320 --> 12:34.621
a record label
that supported them.

12:34.654 --> 12:35.923
-Have the hard conversation.
-They...

12:35.956 --> 12:38.191
I am dropping them.

12:43.964 --> 12:45.833
HAKEEM (on recording):
* I know where you sleep,
I know where you eat *

12:45.866 --> 12:47.835
* I can't have you playing
with my fam *

12:47.868 --> 12:50.670
* Got you counting sheep,
friends turned into enemies *

12:50.703 --> 12:53.640
* You a wannabe rap version
of Kenny G, bow to the king *

12:53.673 --> 12:55.675
-* listen, B...
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:55.708 --> 12:57.410
Ooh, this song goes hard, man.

12:57.444 --> 12:59.112
Blake ain't gonna be ready
for this diss track.

12:59.146 --> 13:01.014
* Six feet under

13:01.048 --> 13:03.616
* You ain't gon' see me coming
like you Stevie Wonder *

13:03.650 --> 13:06.619
* I'm Arenas with the shot,
we ain't talking jumpers *

13:06.653 --> 13:09.189
* Yeah, messing with my girl,
then you deal with me *

13:09.222 --> 13:11.024
-* I can have
your hashtag ready *
-Upload it.

13:11.058 --> 13:12.826
A'ight.
That's ballgame.

13:12.860 --> 13:15.062
* Apples never fall far
from the tree... *

13:21.301 --> 13:23.270
BECKY:
Yo.

13:23.303 --> 13:25.505
Okay, you are not gonna believe

13:25.538 --> 13:27.607
what Kingsley said to me today.
He was talk...

13:27.640 --> 13:30.978
Um, I'm so confused.
Where is your onesie?

13:31.011 --> 13:34.147
(chuckles):
Oh. Right, the onesie.

13:34.181 --> 13:36.783
I just... I haven't even had
a second to get it together.

13:36.816 --> 13:39.319
Why, 'cause you been all up
underneath your new man?

13:39.352 --> 13:41.488
Can we not do that today?

13:41.521 --> 13:42.722
I might have to cut it
a little short, though,

13:42.755 --> 13:43.991
'cause I did promise Kai
that I...

13:44.024 --> 13:45.825
You promised Kai. You know,
give me my damn snacks.

13:45.859 --> 13:48.695
Where are you going? Becky.

13:48.728 --> 13:52.665
Siri, find me a new best friend
who will watch Insecure

13:52.699 --> 13:55.168
and not flake on me every time
he's got a new boyfriend.

13:55.202 --> 13:57.670
-I'm out of here.
-I'm... Becky,
look, I'm trippin'.

13:57.704 --> 13:59.339
Okay? I'm being a complete ass.

13:59.372 --> 14:00.673
-Agreed.
-I am.

14:00.707 --> 14:02.209
So just stay.

14:04.111 --> 14:05.879
And you'll wear the onesie?

14:05.913 --> 14:07.380
(sighs)

14:07.414 --> 14:09.883
Yes, girl,
I'll wear the damn onesie.

14:21.394 --> 14:23.430
Good evening, Mr. Lyon.

14:31.704 --> 14:33.773
Aren't we short a player?

14:33.806 --> 14:35.708
Dr. Smith has been detained
at the hospital,

14:35.742 --> 14:37.410
but the next gentleman
on our wait list

14:37.444 --> 14:39.079
should be here shortly.

14:44.918 --> 14:47.120
Welcome.

14:47.154 --> 14:48.956
MAN:
You a regular here, Mr. Lyon?

14:48.989 --> 14:50.958
I intend to be.

14:50.991 --> 14:52.960
And you are?

14:52.993 --> 14:54.727
I'm Damon Cross.

14:57.297 --> 14:59.232
I hope you're ready.

15:00.467 --> 15:02.269
'Cause I'm a game changer.

15:15.515 --> 15:17.884
-(excited chatter on recording)
-WOMAN: Maya, pass the bong.
-MAYA: Here.

15:17.917 --> 15:20.087
So you see why your mom
is upset, right?

15:20.120 --> 15:23.290
She knows you're smoking up.

15:23.323 --> 15:25.325
You done snitched on yourself.

15:25.358 --> 15:28.395
She's just angry that
I'm not letting her control me.

15:28.428 --> 15:31.131
-I didn't post that.
-I knew

15:31.164 --> 15:33.566
there was something up when
you stopped returning my calls.

15:33.600 --> 15:36.269
I should've...
I should've tried harder.

15:36.303 --> 15:38.871
Look, how do we fix this, hmm?

15:40.974 --> 15:42.675
-MAYA: Hey, babe.
-Hey.

15:42.709 --> 15:45.612
Hey, you all right?

15:45.645 --> 15:48.348
Yeah, I'm good.

15:48.381 --> 15:51.418
Oh, um, this is Cookie.

15:51.451 --> 15:54.154
-My mom sent her to spy on me.
-Ah.

15:54.187 --> 15:57.257
-Hi. Evan.
-Evan.

15:57.290 --> 15:59.326
-Uh...
-Don't you have somewhere
to go, Cookie?

15:59.359 --> 16:00.927
Where you from, Evan?

16:00.960 --> 16:03.463
(chuckles)
Fairfield.

16:03.496 --> 16:05.465
Mm. Family?

16:05.498 --> 16:06.799
Cookie.

16:06.833 --> 16:08.301
EVAN:
Father died when I was five.

16:08.335 --> 16:10.203
Raised by my mother.

16:10.237 --> 16:12.639
And my dad's
significant trust fund.

16:12.672 --> 16:15.542
-Oh. NYU, right?
-Yeah.

16:15.575 --> 16:18.311
Okay, so, you have any plans
when you graduate?

16:18.345 --> 16:22.215
Uh... I open up clubs
all over the globe.

16:22.249 --> 16:24.717
With a bit of help
of the trust fund.

16:24.751 --> 16:26.153
I mean, obviously.

16:26.186 --> 16:29.622
-(chuckles) One last thing.
-Yeah.

16:29.656 --> 16:31.824
Stop posting your videos
on Snapchat

16:31.858 --> 16:33.926
because it's stupid, obviously.

16:36.263 --> 16:38.931
I'll call you later, okay?

16:44.271 --> 16:46.173
Sorry.

16:48.675 --> 16:50.143
Come on, where's
y'all competitive spirit,

16:50.177 --> 16:51.844
ladies and gentlemen?

16:51.878 --> 16:54.514
This is only money.
You can't take it with you.

16:54.547 --> 16:57.984
It can't buy you happiness.
Right, Lucious?

16:58.017 --> 16:59.652
Oh, I'm sorry, I...

16:59.686 --> 17:02.822
You and me are on
a first-name basis now... Damon.

17:02.855 --> 17:05.058
(laughs)
All right.

17:05.092 --> 17:06.259
I'm all in.

17:07.860 --> 17:10.397
Quarter mil, please.

17:10.430 --> 17:12.799
I'm afraid
this is your final borrow.

17:17.970 --> 17:19.772
DAMON:
Hmm.

17:19.806 --> 17:22.309
-Shall we?
-Mm-hmm.

17:26.146 --> 17:28.848
Ah, yes!

17:28.881 --> 17:30.783
There we go.

17:30.817 --> 17:33.386
My apologies, but, um...

17:33.420 --> 17:35.255
what is it that you do?

17:35.288 --> 17:37.257
Oh, man, no apologies.

17:37.290 --> 17:39.926
Unlike you,
I avoid the limelight.

17:39.959 --> 17:42.028
I'm a money guy.

17:42.061 --> 17:44.697
VC? Investment banking?
Hedge fund?

17:44.731 --> 17:47.033
Mm, I don't like labels.

17:47.066 --> 17:48.435
But people
who need my services--

17:48.468 --> 17:50.437
they know I'm the best
at what I do.

17:58.645 --> 18:00.880
I don't even know why he wants

18:00.913 --> 18:02.315
to run a music label
in the first place.

18:02.349 --> 18:04.083
He clearly hates music.

18:04.117 --> 18:05.285
(Jamal laughing)

18:05.318 --> 18:07.387
BECKY:
Hello?

18:07.420 --> 18:09.889
What's so funny? My pain?

18:09.922 --> 18:13.793
I'm sorry, boo.
I'm so sorry.

18:13.826 --> 18:15.228
No, no, no.

18:15.262 --> 18:17.764
These are mine.
Have you been eating these?

18:17.797 --> 18:19.632
Yeah, my bad.

18:19.666 --> 18:21.668
I got hungry.

18:21.701 --> 18:23.436
No, hon, these are...

18:23.470 --> 18:25.172
these are my edibles.

18:25.205 --> 18:27.607
-Your what?
-My edibles.

18:27.640 --> 18:30.477
What? Becky,
I can't eat no damn edibles.

18:30.510 --> 18:32.679
I'm in recovery. I don't
even celebrate 420 anymore.

18:32.712 --> 18:33.813
Well, why you eating them?

18:33.846 --> 18:35.182
Why the hell
you bring them over here?

18:35.215 --> 18:36.783
For my anxiety.

18:38.050 --> 18:40.153
I just like to get high.

18:40.187 --> 18:42.689
Why the hell would...

18:42.722 --> 18:44.291
Are you okay?

18:44.324 --> 18:46.125
-Becky, I...
-(whistling)

18:46.159 --> 18:48.161
It's your phone.

18:49.996 --> 18:52.131
Oh, you gonna have to just
breathe through this, okay?

18:52.165 --> 18:53.466
What?

18:53.500 --> 18:55.101
-Are you...?
-Kai's coming home.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.769
So?

18:56.803 --> 18:58.971
-Hide. Hide.
-What is your...?

18:59.005 --> 19:00.340
Hide from what?

19:00.373 --> 19:01.941
From who? Kai?

19:01.974 --> 19:04.477
-(laughs) Why are you hiding?
-Becky!

19:04.511 --> 19:06.846
* 'Cause I'm the big dog, all
my homies call me Clifford... *

19:06.879 --> 19:08.915
-Sorry, Juanita.
-(music stops)

19:16.155 --> 19:17.724
(snoring)

19:17.757 --> 19:19.559
Hakeem.

19:21.694 --> 19:23.796
Hakeem.

19:23.830 --> 19:26.165
-Wake up.
-(grunts)

19:26.199 --> 19:28.968
Come on, man. Come on, get up.

19:29.001 --> 19:30.903
Take a shower, man.

19:34.741 --> 19:36.709
Where Chicken and Marcel at?

19:36.743 --> 19:38.711
They went home.

19:38.745 --> 19:40.680
Now prove to me I don't need
to be worried about you.

19:44.251 --> 19:47.220
Take a shower
and let's get something to eat.

19:49.956 --> 19:51.491
(crunching)

19:51.524 --> 19:52.992
-BECKY: Oh, shh, shh.
-JAMAL: Shh.

19:53.025 --> 19:54.927
BECKY (whispering): Just freeze.
I'm gonna tell you something.

19:54.961 --> 19:58.197
-Shush. That's what I got
to tell you. Shush.
-No.

19:58.231 --> 20:01.734
Uh, you two are aware that
I can see and hear you, right?

20:01.768 --> 20:04.737
That's why I told you shush.

20:04.771 --> 20:06.373
-Hey, Kai.
-Hi.

20:09.442 --> 20:12.078
Babe, Becky messed me up.

20:12.111 --> 20:13.680
And now all of my...

20:13.713 --> 20:15.415
all sobriety chips are gone.

20:15.448 --> 20:17.049
BECKY:
Wow. Okay, first of all,

20:17.083 --> 20:19.018
I didn't even offer it to you.
You just went through my bag,

20:19.051 --> 20:21.220
and now you throwing me under
the bus for your man tonight?

20:21.254 --> 20:23.222
-But you don't
even understand, B.
-Sure don't.

20:23.256 --> 20:24.957
That's what I'm saying.
Babe, she don't understand.

20:24.991 --> 20:27.527
-Okay, okay, then explain it
to us, then, Jamal.
-Oh, I don't.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.462
I will.

20:35.167 --> 20:38.605
Sometimes...
sometimes I feel like...

20:38.638 --> 20:42.442
even you two don't know
what it's like to be me.

20:42.475 --> 20:44.944
Exactly, and you can't talk
to anybody about it,

20:44.977 --> 20:46.446
'cause everybody's like,
"Oh, don't nobody want to hear

20:46.479 --> 20:50.550
about some good-looking,
sexy as hell R&B god."

20:50.583 --> 20:52.985
-Or whatever. I know that
that sounds ridiculous.
-Oh, my God. R&B god?

20:53.019 --> 20:55.555
-Is that what you think
my inner...? Okay.
-Back. Back, back, back.

20:55.588 --> 20:58.257
Do you know what it's like
to be me? It ain't been easy.

21:00.660 --> 21:03.630
All alone, like a loser.

21:07.867 --> 21:09.369
KAI:
Mm-hmm.

21:12.939 --> 21:15.074
Huh?

21:15.107 --> 21:17.009
We're all in this together.

21:17.043 --> 21:18.945
-Psycho.
-But you like that.

21:18.978 --> 21:21.448
-I like that. (laughs)
-Hmm? Okay. (laughs)

21:21.481 --> 21:24.651
-Wow.
-(Cookie exhales)

21:24.684 --> 21:26.486
Cookie, say hey.

21:26.519 --> 21:29.021
-Girl, get that out of my face.
-You on live.

21:29.055 --> 21:31.524
It's dinnertime, y'all,

21:31.558 --> 21:34.026
and even Cookie Lyon
gets hungry.

21:34.060 --> 21:35.762
But she never gives up.

21:35.795 --> 21:38.631
Uh, we will be back
in Riverside Park

21:38.665 --> 21:41.468
to finish out Manhattan Day
in a couple of hours.

21:41.501 --> 21:44.971
Um, hey, we gon' find that star.

21:45.004 --> 21:47.106
Tonight. (laughs)

21:47.139 --> 21:49.075
All right,
see you after the break.

21:52.211 --> 21:54.113
We did find a star, you know.

21:54.146 --> 21:55.682
Oh, I hope you're not talking

21:55.715 --> 21:58.284
about your fake cousin,
Lil Town.

21:58.317 --> 21:59.952
-Uh, Big City.
-Right.

21:59.986 --> 22:01.454
And I'm talking about you.

22:01.488 --> 22:03.690
Your followers
and your impressions are way up.

22:03.723 --> 22:06.158
People are saying
if Simon Cowell and Iyanla

22:06.192 --> 22:07.660
had a baby, it would be you.

22:07.694 --> 22:10.497
-(chuckles) What?
-(phone ringing)

22:15.402 --> 22:17.637
-Hello?
-RECORDED MALE VOICE:
You have a collect call

22:17.670 --> 22:19.205
from the Manhattan
Police Department.

22:19.238 --> 22:21.140
To accept the call,
please press one.

22:21.173 --> 22:23.142
Who is this calling me
from jail?

22:23.175 --> 22:25.244
(beep)

22:25.277 --> 22:27.013
Who is this?

22:27.046 --> 22:28.948
(on phone):
It's Maya.

22:36.188 --> 22:38.357
-Something ain't right
with your story, Maya.
-I told you everything.

22:38.391 --> 22:39.859
Yeah, you told me everything
to keep me

22:39.892 --> 22:41.694
from asking you
the million-dollar question.

22:41.728 --> 22:44.030
-What are you talking about?
-Why were you carrying stuff

22:44.063 --> 22:46.666
for a supposed
club promoter, huh?

22:46.699 --> 22:48.568
Tell me that.

22:48.601 --> 22:50.369
Well, because he, uh...

22:50.403 --> 22:53.205
Okay. So, I went
to the laundromat,

22:53.239 --> 22:54.574
-Mm-hmm.
-and-and a guy named Sh...

22:54.607 --> 22:56.342
Hey.

22:56.375 --> 22:57.844
(sighs)

22:57.877 --> 22:59.345
Go ahead.

22:59.378 --> 23:01.380
A guy named Ship
identified himself,

23:01.414 --> 23:03.115
just like Evan said he would,

23:03.149 --> 23:05.718
and, um, I gave him the bag
and then he gave me

23:05.752 --> 23:08.254
the money, and it was like,
as soon as I took the bag fr...

23:08.287 --> 23:10.222
Yeah, he flashed his badge,
and all of a sudden

23:10.256 --> 23:11.891
cops were everywhere, right?

23:11.924 --> 23:14.026
How di-how did you know that?

23:14.060 --> 23:16.295
Because I'm from these
damn streets, Maya, okay?

23:16.328 --> 23:19.131
You are just a middle-class
black-white girl who knows

23:19.165 --> 23:22.134
how to tell a fake Balenciaga
bag from the real one,

23:22.168 --> 23:24.203
'cause that's what you do.
I can tell the difference

23:24.236 --> 23:27.440
from a real drug dealer
and a undercover cop,

23:27.474 --> 23:29.208
'cause that's what I do.

23:29.241 --> 23:30.777
Damn.

23:30.810 --> 23:33.145
I feel really stupid.

23:36.282 --> 23:37.684
Come here.

23:40.352 --> 23:42.321
You're not stupid, sweetheart,

23:42.354 --> 23:44.323
you're just dumb in love.

23:44.356 --> 23:47.494
Cookie, I can't...
I can't be with him.

23:47.527 --> 23:49.662
I know that.

23:49.696 --> 23:51.464
So will you come help me
get my stuff?

23:51.498 --> 23:52.965
I sure as hell will.

23:52.999 --> 23:54.433
Taxi!

24:03.776 --> 24:05.612
You got a minute, boy genius?

24:06.879 --> 24:08.681
What's up?

24:08.715 --> 24:11.183
I believe in analytics just...
w... almost as much as you do.

24:11.217 --> 24:12.785
I just want to make sure

24:12.819 --> 24:15.688
that you're inputting
the proper values

24:15.722 --> 24:18.958
before we dump
a potential cash cow.

24:18.991 --> 24:22.495
Three Black Divas sold out every
date on their east coast tour.

24:22.529 --> 24:24.797
That success piqued the interest

24:24.831 --> 24:26.999
of Andy Cohen
and Steve Wynn.

24:27.033 --> 24:28.635
If we cut them now

24:28.668 --> 24:30.169
we're just
leaving money on the table.

24:32.338 --> 24:35.542
Going backwards to pick up
pennies from the past

24:35.575 --> 24:38.845
is not going to help Empire
get to its very bright future.

24:38.878 --> 24:41.480
Please do what I said.

24:44.817 --> 24:47.386
This isn't about TBD.

24:47.419 --> 24:49.355
It's about the Lyons.

24:49.388 --> 24:52.825
The success of TBD
would be a victory

24:52.859 --> 24:54.794
for Cookie and Lucious.

24:54.827 --> 24:56.395
And you'd rather
destroy the careers

24:56.428 --> 24:58.965
of these talented singers
than risk Lucious

24:58.998 --> 25:02.234
getting the credit
for their success, right?

25:04.503 --> 25:06.405
Do you hear yourself
right now, Giselle?

25:08.207 --> 25:09.508
You sound crazy.

25:10.777 --> 25:13.245
(chuckles softly)

25:13.279 --> 25:15.214
It does sound crazy, doesn't it?

25:33.800 --> 25:37.003
(whispering):
Focus. Focus.

25:37.036 --> 25:40.206
Focus, focus, focus, focus.

26:08.768 --> 26:10.469
* Think that I'm done trippin' *

26:10.502 --> 26:11.971
* I'm trip-trippin',
I've been... *

26:12.004 --> 26:13.405
Y'all, I have an idea.

26:13.439 --> 26:14.641
Y'all, I have
an idea.

26:14.674 --> 26:17.276
Yo, what's your idea?

26:17.309 --> 26:19.646
No, I ain't got no idea, I was
just being supportive of you.

26:19.679 --> 26:21.614
I was just, like, trying to give
back to my community,

26:21.648 --> 26:23.549
-you know what I mean?
-Jamal. Baby...

26:23.582 --> 26:25.151
-I love you!
-I love you.

26:25.184 --> 26:26.753
-(laughs)
-(laughs) I'm...

26:26.786 --> 26:29.455
I'm begging...
What's-what's your idea?

26:29.488 --> 26:31.090
BECKY:
Oh, my God.

26:31.123 --> 26:34.994
A'ight-- we should play
truth or dare.

26:35.027 --> 26:36.663
Oh, snap. True...

26:36.696 --> 26:38.564
-Truth!
-Hey... No one
asked a question yet.

26:38.597 --> 26:41.500
Truth: Jamal
is scared of clowns, right?

26:41.533 --> 26:42.669
-True.
-That's true, that's true.

26:42.702 --> 26:44.470
Jamal got hella smelly feet.

26:44.503 --> 26:45.972
-Ooh. True, true.
-Like, gross, bee-ba soo-rah,

26:46.005 --> 26:48.007
-trash.
-True, true.

26:48.040 --> 26:51.577
Oh, that's true-true.
Also, also, um, all of Jamal's,

26:51.610 --> 26:53.946
like, ex-boyfriends-- and he's
got a lot, 'cause, like, he's

26:53.980 --> 26:56.348
low-key ho-key, you know what
I mean? You know-you know what,

26:56.382 --> 26:57.416
-Michael's my favorite.
-But who said that, though?

26:57.449 --> 26:58.918
That's true, true, true.

26:58.951 --> 27:02.321
Okay, this is not
how you play, but, truth:

27:02.354 --> 27:05.624
Kai... put himself
through law school

27:05.658 --> 27:09.095
as an exotic dancer named

27:09.128 --> 27:11.197
Chocolate and Dynamite.

27:11.230 --> 27:13.465
-Pow! Pow!
-(both clamoring)

27:15.835 --> 27:17.870
If Michael was so special,

27:17.904 --> 27:20.172
why do I have
a ring on my finger?

27:20.206 --> 27:23.142
* To be true,
baby boy, your love... *

27:23.175 --> 27:25.044
Oh, hell.

27:25.077 --> 27:27.279
You proposed to him
and you didn't tell me?

27:27.313 --> 27:30.616
* Yeah, it's big enough,
got me trippin' on you. *

27:30.649 --> 27:33.319
-(all laughing)
-Yo! Hey, yo, listen,

27:33.352 --> 27:36.322
listen, listen, listen.
To Giselle and Becky.

27:36.355 --> 27:38.691
-Cheers.
-TASHA: Hell yeah. (laughs)
-BROOKE: Get that!

27:38.725 --> 27:40.626
TASHA:
And Jeff Kingsley's

27:40.659 --> 27:43.195
new vision for Empire.

27:43.229 --> 27:45.965
-DENISE: Okay, yeah!
-BROOKE:
Get a little more on that.

27:45.998 --> 27:48.000
-(laughs)
-GISELLE: Jeff, my ass.

27:48.034 --> 27:50.469
I think you need
to give yourself

27:50.502 --> 27:52.839
-a little more credit, ladies.
-BROOKE: Hmm.

27:52.872 --> 27:54.206
(chuckling)

27:54.240 --> 27:55.708
Because what Jeff Kingsley

27:55.742 --> 27:57.977
doesn't realize is that...

27:58.010 --> 28:01.680
-you pulled yourself up
from nothing.
-TASHA: Well...

28:01.714 --> 28:03.649
Hey. Got that right.

28:03.682 --> 28:06.318
-You put in your time.
-DENISE: Yeah.

28:06.352 --> 28:09.221
-You paid your dues.
-DENISE: Mm-hmm.
-TASHA: Yes.

28:09.255 --> 28:12.725
-And your moment is right now.
-DENISE: All right. (chuckles)

28:12.759 --> 28:14.060
And Jeff Kingsley

28:14.093 --> 28:16.763
doesn't have a vision...

28:18.097 --> 28:19.598
...he's got a computer.

28:19.631 --> 28:22.234
Okay, well,
what's wrong with that?

28:22.268 --> 28:23.602
BROOKE:
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa--

28:23.635 --> 28:25.772
why was he really
in the studio today?

28:25.805 --> 28:28.841
He was... minding my business.

28:28.875 --> 28:31.343
The real reason.

28:31.377 --> 28:33.279
He's a chump.

28:34.713 --> 28:36.115
And a bitch.

28:38.951 --> 28:40.887
And he wants to drop you
from the label.

28:40.920 --> 28:44.123
-What?
-Wh-What... the hell you...?

28:44.156 --> 28:45.792
-(stammers)
-I don't-I don't unders...

28:45.825 --> 28:47.894
We just killed in there.

28:47.927 --> 28:50.897
-DENISE: What?
-He don't know.

28:50.930 --> 28:53.365
-Wow.
-DENISE: I don't unders...
I don't understand. What?

28:53.399 --> 28:56.568
GISELLE:
It's because he don't know
nothing about nothing.

28:56.602 --> 28:58.237
-DENISE: Wait a minute...
-Don't you worry, though.

28:58.270 --> 28:59.605
I got this.

28:59.638 --> 29:01.874
He's a digital...

29:01.908 --> 29:03.943
-scumbag.
-No, no, no, no. No, we-we...

29:03.976 --> 29:05.945
we been working really hard.

29:05.978 --> 29:08.981
This, right here-- this is what
makes you miss the Lyons.

29:09.015 --> 29:12.451
-(sighs)
-'Cause at least they knew
what we were worth.

29:22.795 --> 29:24.696
Hakeem.

29:30.302 --> 29:32.839
I thought we agreed, man--
shower and dinner.

29:33.973 --> 29:34.974
No time.

29:35.007 --> 29:36.475
I listened to your diss track.

29:36.508 --> 29:39.311
-It's lit, right?
-I heard a lot of pain.

29:39.345 --> 29:41.680
I think you should
talk to somebody. A therapist.

29:41.713 --> 29:44.716
That ain't me. You holding
the crazy spot in the family.

29:48.387 --> 29:52.224
Then I should know
when somebody needs help, right?

29:55.627 --> 29:58.364
Rapping is my therapy.

29:58.397 --> 29:59.966
Look at you.

29:59.999 --> 30:02.701
It's not working.
Don't you want to be

30:02.734 --> 30:04.770
the best father you can be?
Do it for your kids.

30:04.803 --> 30:06.705
I am a great father.

30:08.540 --> 30:10.776
And I grew up without Moms.

30:10.809 --> 30:12.778
And I damn sure
don't need no therapist

30:12.811 --> 30:14.713
to tell me how much that hurt.

30:16.215 --> 30:18.484
I never wanted Bella
to go through that.

30:18.517 --> 30:21.687
But you did that to her.

30:21.720 --> 30:24.156
Does November 25
mean anything to you?

30:26.425 --> 30:28.394
It's Rhonda's due date.

30:29.728 --> 30:31.898
I was going to be a father.

30:31.931 --> 30:34.533
My son would have been
five years old now.

30:37.669 --> 30:39.371
Anika killed him, Hakeem.

30:39.405 --> 30:42.741
And I'm not trying to go
tit for tat with you on this.

30:42.774 --> 30:46.312
I am sorry
for the pain I caused you.

30:46.345 --> 30:47.746
But you ain't, though.

30:49.348 --> 30:50.749
I am.

30:53.285 --> 30:55.221
You're my baby brother, Hakeem.

30:55.254 --> 30:59.191
I never meant
to hurt you or Bella.

30:59.225 --> 31:02.394
And I swear to you...

31:02.428 --> 31:05.397
I'm gonna spend
the rest of my life

31:05.431 --> 31:07.366
making up for that.

31:08.867 --> 31:12.604
Hakeem, I need us both
to understand

31:12.638 --> 31:14.640
what we've been through.

31:17.709 --> 31:19.611
Can you do that?

31:26.318 --> 31:27.586
You know what?

31:30.289 --> 31:33.859
I'm leaving.

31:33.892 --> 31:37.096
-Becky, come on, man,
I told you that I was going to,
-Let me get my stuff.

31:37.129 --> 31:38.864
-so just chill, it's all love.
-Let me just get my stuff.

31:38.897 --> 31:41.767
Yeller!
You heard it, Potato Chip?

31:41.800 --> 31:43.569
(deep voice):
I definitely heard it.

31:43.602 --> 31:45.271
Tell him to kiss your ass.

31:45.304 --> 31:46.605
You guys are both right.

31:46.638 --> 31:48.207
-Kiss my ass!
-Becky...

31:48.240 --> 31:49.408
-Bye!
-Wait, wait, wait.
Becky, Becky...

31:49.441 --> 31:51.343
Just let her go,
just let her go.

31:54.313 --> 31:56.282
You really don't
want me here, do you?

31:56.315 --> 31:58.750
Of course he does.
Becky, we both do.

31:58.784 --> 32:00.486
Jamal's just
being an ass right now.

32:00.519 --> 32:03.522
Well, then I'm waiting
for my apology.

32:06.625 --> 32:08.027
Damn.

32:12.999 --> 32:14.666
Becky, please stay.

32:14.700 --> 32:16.835
Do you promise
he's the last one?

32:16.868 --> 32:18.470
Literally, yes.

32:18.504 --> 32:20.506
For the rest of my life.

32:23.675 --> 32:25.911
Good, because I'm sick of it.

32:25.944 --> 32:29.648
And, truth...

32:29.681 --> 32:31.984
when you went missing, I didn't
even really feel nothing.

32:32.018 --> 32:34.820
-JAMAL: Oh, wow. Okay.
-Oh. That's rude.

32:34.853 --> 32:37.756
-I wasn't sad, hurt--
none of that.
-Okay, I mean,

32:37.789 --> 32:39.458
-that's important information
for him to hear.
-Yeah, that's just my truth.

32:39.491 --> 32:43.295
-That... This...
-But-- but--
let me finish my truth.

32:43.329 --> 32:45.597
Like, if you died
right this second--

32:45.631 --> 32:48.967
you know, like, right this...
(grunts) this second?

32:49.001 --> 32:52.138
I would feel, um...
I would be sad

32:52.171 --> 32:53.772
-if you died right now.
-Thanks.

32:53.805 --> 32:56.975
I would be sad if I died too.

32:57.009 --> 32:59.545
Um, you got to come...
you got to come hug me now,

32:59.578 --> 33:02.881
since we-we in the family.
We-we family now.

33:02.914 --> 33:06.018
Go under, though,
'cause I like to be up.

33:06.052 --> 33:08.520
-Come on, come on. Go un...
-Oh, okay, okay, got that. I'm
glad you said something. Okay.

33:08.554 --> 33:09.855
BECKY:
I'm-a caress you.

33:09.888 --> 33:11.157
Uh, Mal? Mal?

33:11.190 --> 33:12.524
KAI:
Try to get in on this?

33:12.558 --> 33:14.026
-'Cause we... we're family now,
-Baby?

33:14.060 --> 33:15.961
-so we got to...
-There you go.

33:15.994 --> 33:17.396
Mmm.

33:21.500 --> 33:22.701
(knocking continues)

33:24.203 --> 33:25.804
-What the hell
is taking you so lo...
-Hey. Cookie.

33:25.837 --> 33:28.040
It's.. Uh, Cookie,
I changed my mind.

33:31.543 --> 33:34.346
You changed your mind?

33:34.380 --> 33:36.215
Or that bastard smirking

33:36.248 --> 33:38.184
in the corner over there
changed your mind?

33:38.217 --> 33:39.751
The reason that he couldn't
bail me out, Cookie,

33:39.785 --> 33:41.253
is because the way
his trust fund...

33:41.287 --> 33:43.155
Sweetie, listen to me.

33:43.189 --> 33:45.257
That boy don't
care about you, okay?

33:45.291 --> 33:47.193
He cares about
somebody like you,

33:47.226 --> 33:48.760
someone foolish enough

33:48.794 --> 33:51.029
to carry his packages around
and not snitch

33:51.063 --> 33:52.998
on his narrow ass
if you get caught.

33:53.031 --> 33:55.434
He doesn't love you, Maya.
That's not love.

33:55.467 --> 33:57.169
And you do?

33:57.203 --> 34:00.005
Cookie, you introduced me
to my convict birth mother.

34:00.038 --> 34:02.241
You turned my world upside down.

34:03.742 --> 34:06.212
(sighs)
That's not fair,

34:06.245 --> 34:08.547
'cause Poundcake
really loved you, Maya.

34:08.580 --> 34:10.382
And I-I thought you should know.

34:10.416 --> 34:12.951
Yeah, but for one second,
Cookie, did you think

34:12.984 --> 34:15.221
that maybe me finding out
that I'm a product

34:15.254 --> 34:18.557
of a jailhouse rape
might mess me up?

34:21.660 --> 34:25.097
(short chuckle)
I'm sorry.

34:26.898 --> 34:28.434
I guess Queen Cookie
doesn't know everything,

34:28.467 --> 34:30.802
does she?

34:30.836 --> 34:32.771
'Cause you surely don't know
anything about love,

34:32.804 --> 34:34.473
because if you did,
you wouldn't be with a man

34:34.506 --> 34:36.808
who let you rot in jail
for 17 years,

34:36.842 --> 34:38.444
and-and with Hakeem,

34:38.477 --> 34:41.280
on stage playing
"drop the mic" with a gun?

34:41.313 --> 34:43.782
Cookie, you have
your own family to fix.

34:43.815 --> 34:46.685
No. Honestly,
what are you doing here?

34:48.287 --> 34:50.656
Exactly.

34:50.689 --> 34:51.923
(scoffs)

34:54.160 --> 34:56.328
-(sighs)
-(lock clicks)

35:10.842 --> 35:14.079
Look at all those people waiting
for you to change their lives.

35:14.112 --> 35:17.483
How do you feel
about that, Cookie?

35:17.516 --> 35:19.151
I think...

35:19.185 --> 35:21.620
(indistinct chatter)

35:21.653 --> 35:23.555
(sighs)

35:25.657 --> 35:27.959
(sighs) I think...

35:27.993 --> 35:31.630
I don't have all the answers.

35:31.663 --> 35:33.165
And the answers I do have,

35:33.199 --> 35:35.667
they ain't the right ones.

35:35.701 --> 35:38.537
Listen to me,
sounding all shocked.

35:40.138 --> 35:43.709
Who the hell do I think I am?

35:43.742 --> 35:46.645
Thinking I can fix
every-damn-body

35:46.678 --> 35:48.514
and save everything.

35:48.547 --> 35:52.451
I... I can't even
fix my own family.

35:52.484 --> 35:54.186
You know what, Cookie?

35:54.220 --> 35:55.554
I'm-a just gonna go ahead
and stop this.

35:55.587 --> 35:57.523
No.

35:57.556 --> 36:00.659
(sighs)

36:00.692 --> 36:03.028
(laughs)

36:03.061 --> 36:07.399
I mean, what do I know, huh?

36:07.433 --> 36:10.502
What do I know except music?

36:15.874 --> 36:19.010
I know a hit when I hear one.

36:19.044 --> 36:22.481
So, five boroughs
in five days.

36:22.514 --> 36:26.084
And like I said: bring it.

36:28.086 --> 36:30.789
You never game me my shoes,
Porsha.

36:32.123 --> 36:34.526
Put up or shut up, man.

36:34.560 --> 36:36.495
Come on,
you Al B. Sure! lookin'...

36:36.528 --> 36:38.196
(laughing)

36:38.230 --> 36:39.898
You ain't nothin', Lyon.

36:39.931 --> 36:42.901
Yeah, that's a lot coming
from your broke ass.

36:42.934 --> 36:44.903
What you got?

36:44.936 --> 36:46.705
Hey, spot me 250.

36:46.738 --> 36:48.073
I got this.

36:48.106 --> 36:49.575
This is my turn.
I got this.

36:49.608 --> 36:50.876
You're on the tilt, Mr. Binyan.

36:50.909 --> 36:52.544
I've already cut you off.

36:52.578 --> 36:54.680
I'm sorry, but you'll have to
fold the hand

36:54.713 --> 36:56.515
if you cannot meet
Mr. Lyon's bet.

36:56.548 --> 36:59.217
I will tell you what, sexy.

36:59.251 --> 37:01.086
If you're so certain about them

37:01.119 --> 37:03.021
pretty little cards
in your hand, why don't you

37:03.054 --> 37:06.392
just put Carlito right there
on top of the pile?

37:06.425 --> 37:10.195
We can toss the cards over
and winner take all.

37:10.228 --> 37:12.564
You're bluffing.

37:12.598 --> 37:15.133
Maybe.

37:15.166 --> 37:18.637
Or maybe not.

37:18.670 --> 37:21.507
(Lucious chuckles)

37:30.449 --> 37:32.818
Deal.

37:32.851 --> 37:35.186
(chuckles)

37:43.429 --> 37:46.432
Three tens.

37:49.868 --> 37:52.203
But, oops.
(laughs)

37:56.808 --> 37:58.810
(grunts)
Okay.

37:58.844 --> 38:02.180
I look forward to Carlito
coming by the house

38:02.213 --> 38:04.249
and meeting his new mommy
and daddy

38:04.282 --> 38:05.984
with Lyon Family Management.

38:06.017 --> 38:07.919
-Nobody move!
-(woman shrieks)

38:07.953 --> 38:11.857
Put your hands up!
Don't...

38:11.890 --> 38:13.492
-Get all that money.
-(screams)

38:16.495 --> 38:19.130
-Man!
-Get your hands up!

38:19.164 --> 38:22.200
-Let's go.
-Get your hands up!

38:22.233 --> 38:24.002
I wouldn't do that
if I was you.

38:24.035 --> 38:25.003
Get your hands up!

38:25.036 --> 38:26.037
-Oh, my God.
-ROBBER: All right.

38:28.740 --> 38:30.709
Get all that money.

38:30.742 --> 38:32.378
Everybody be cool.

38:32.411 --> 38:33.979
Nobody move, nobody get hurt.

38:34.012 --> 38:37.015
Man with a plan, man.

38:37.048 --> 38:40.852
My idea is never enter
a building...

38:40.886 --> 38:42.721
if you don't have
an exit strategy.

38:42.754 --> 38:44.723
I owe you.

38:44.756 --> 38:46.658
I'm looking forward to seeing
what you're gonna do

38:46.692 --> 38:48.126
with Lyon Family Management.

38:48.159 --> 38:50.696
Word on the street,
you coming strong.

38:50.729 --> 38:52.631
Well, you know Lyons,

38:52.664 --> 38:54.400
that's all we do
is come strong.

38:54.433 --> 38:56.067
All right.

39:06.445 --> 39:08.213
I'm telling you, your...
our plan was perfect.

39:08.246 --> 39:11.316
Automatic weapons, masks...

39:11.349 --> 39:13.251
We got four million dollars.

39:13.284 --> 39:14.653
And you won Carlito, right?

39:14.686 --> 39:17.689
-Yeah.
-The plan...

39:17.723 --> 39:19.558
was damn near perfect.

39:23.094 --> 39:25.363
Near perfect?

39:25.397 --> 39:29.267
I went to pick up
the Derrick Adams.

39:29.300 --> 39:31.369
Your boy sold it.

39:38.810 --> 39:40.178
(clears throat)

39:40.211 --> 39:42.414
I know.

39:42.448 --> 39:45.417
I mean, some corporate buyer

39:45.451 --> 39:47.018
made him a deal
he couldn't refuse.

39:47.052 --> 39:49.421
I am tracking it down now.

39:49.455 --> 39:52.758
I'm getting a copy printed until
we get the original back.

39:52.791 --> 39:54.793
Cookie won't even notice it.

39:54.826 --> 39:58.664
Get me that damn painting.

40:19.284 --> 40:20.852
I was wondering where you were.

40:22.454 --> 40:23.889
Thought you'd be upstairs
in bed,

40:23.922 --> 40:27.292
waiting for me to come
and climb up on top.

40:29.094 --> 40:31.329
You know what?
You are not sexy

40:31.362 --> 40:34.165
when you're feeling yourself
like this.

40:34.199 --> 40:35.901
Damn.
What's wrong with you?

40:35.934 --> 40:39.938
I thought I'd get
a chuckle or something.

40:39.971 --> 40:42.974
-What's wrong?
-(chuckles) It's just,

40:43.008 --> 40:45.110
I feel like we're moving
too fast, you know?

40:45.143 --> 40:46.845
Like, we're making
all of these decisions,

40:46.878 --> 40:49.615
and we're not
thinking them through.

40:49.648 --> 40:51.650
Mm... Baby,

40:51.683 --> 40:55.487
I've found that you and me,
we make our very best decisions

40:55.521 --> 40:58.857
when we come from our gut
and then we move.

40:58.890 --> 41:01.192
That's how and why...

41:01.226 --> 41:04.496
we get...

41:04.530 --> 41:07.032
what we want and need
from this life.

41:17.075 --> 41:19.678
Well, isn't this special?

41:22.681 --> 41:25.050
You know I love you, right?

41:26.752 --> 41:28.987
Why you being all extra?

41:29.020 --> 41:30.221
I wouldn't be extra

41:30.255 --> 41:32.558
if you weren't writing lyrics

41:32.591 --> 41:35.561
that sound like
you want to kill somebody.

41:35.594 --> 41:37.629
Ma, I had to get it out.

41:37.663 --> 41:39.164
But I'm good.

41:43.268 --> 41:45.370
(doorbell rings)

41:52.778 --> 41:54.379
This ought to be interesting.

41:54.412 --> 41:56.014
We have a proposition for you.

41:56.047 --> 41:57.515
We?

41:57.549 --> 41:59.517
Hey, Lucious.

42:00.886 --> 42:02.854
(sighs)

42:02.888 --> 42:05.023
If you want to make some money,
you'll invite us in.

42:05.056 --> 42:08.627
Honey, we've got guests.

42:18.637 --> 42:20.672
Can we get on with this, please?

42:20.706 --> 42:23.374
Now, Mr. Lyon still needs to pay
his respects at the gravesite.

42:23.408 --> 42:25.911
Please.

42:25.944 --> 42:28.446
Last time we talked, you said
that you did not know this man.

42:30.215 --> 42:31.617
Please tell me
you're not interrupting

42:31.650 --> 42:33.251
my client's grieving

42:33.284 --> 42:35.053
to repeat back to him
what he already told you.

42:35.086 --> 42:36.922
This is a total waste of time.
This is a waste of time

42:36.955 --> 42:38.556
-and FB...
-No, Thirst, wait.

42:38.590 --> 42:40.959
He wouldn't have driven
all the way up here

42:40.992 --> 42:43.094
unless he thought
he had something...

42:43.128 --> 42:45.030
worth showing me.

42:45.063 --> 42:47.098
Go ahead.

42:47.132 --> 42:49.267
Well, you might not know
Damon Cross.

42:49.300 --> 42:51.269
But your wife certainly does.

42:54.606 --> 42:56.808
In fact, they look
downright friendly.

43:15.026 --> 43:16.662
Care to explain?

44:05.143 --> 44:07.145
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

44:09.147 --> 44:11.282
Now that Empire
has you all fired up,

44:11.316 --> 44:13.584
here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

44:16.054 --> 44:17.255
Buckle up, buttercup.

44:19.590 --> 44:21.960
It's real, and it pulls
people together.

44:21.993 --> 44:25.530
-* We're breaking waves
shooting star *
-(siren wailing)

44:25.563 --> 44:29.134
* We live for glory
not forever *

44:29.167 --> 44:30.168
MAN: Touchdown!

44:30.201 --> 44:33.739
* Reach out *

44:33.772 --> 44:37.375
* Make this right here
right now *

44:37.408 --> 44:40.345
* Stand up *

44:41.212 --> 44:42.981
* Here right now *

44:43.014 --> 44:44.682
That sounds like fun.
