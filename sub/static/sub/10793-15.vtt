WEBVTT

00:00.300 --> 00:03.500
This is what Destiny intended from
the moment it entered the star system.

00:04.736 --> 00:06.671
We are going to survive.

00:06.672 --> 00:09.600
We are going to make it home.

00:10.000 --> 00:13.645
I'm telling you, the ship
came here for a reason.

00:13.646 --> 00:16.280
Destiny is powered
by the stars themselves.

00:16.981 --> 00:18.783
He and Young are
bumping heads, yes.

00:19.584 --> 00:22.219
Not sure which camp
is the better choice.

00:22.220 --> 00:23.487
We just pretend
nothing happened.

00:23.488 --> 00:26.324
We need to be ready
for the next encounter.

00:26.325 --> 00:27.792
For the sake of the crew.

00:28.293 --> 00:30.228
For the sake of the crew.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.200
I'm not sick.

00:34.534 --> 00:36.068
What about the father?

00:37.271 --> 00:38.571
This is unlike
any other kind

00:38.572 --> 00:40.939
Of alien technology
we've encountered before.

00:40.940 --> 00:42.574
If they're indigenous to
this part of the universe,

00:42.575 --> 00:44.108
They might be willing to trade.

00:45.712 --> 00:47.079
You lost the kino?

00:47.080 --> 00:49.548
No, I took a wrong turn
trying to steer it out.

00:49.549 --> 00:52.451
I just need to take a look
and get my bearings.

00:55.922 --> 00:58.255
We haven't found
any other sort of exit,

00:58.256 --> 00:59.558
Or access to ground level.

00:59.559 --> 01:00.525
We're not going to make it.

01:00.526 --> 01:01.827
Fire in the hole!

01:04.998 --> 01:06.598
Doesn't look like that had
the desired effect.

01:06.599 --> 01:07.966
We just made things
a lot worse.

01:09.635 --> 01:12.971
God be with you, Colonel.

01:16.542 --> 01:18.210
Riley...

01:18.211 --> 01:19.211
I think Eli would
want someone

01:19.212 --> 01:20.479
Documenting
the efforts

01:20.480 --> 01:21.680
To rescue the team

01:21.681 --> 01:22.681
That was
left behind.

01:22.682 --> 01:24.216
Well, given that Eli is
one of the team

01:24.217 --> 01:25.183
That was left behind,

01:25.184 --> 01:26.551
I would have thought

01:26.552 --> 01:28.153
He'd want everyone
doing anything possible

01:28.154 --> 01:29.488
To help rescue them.

01:29.489 --> 01:30.822
Well, you didn't like my idea.

01:30.823 --> 01:31.957
Telling Destiny to go
back and pick them up

01:31.958 --> 01:32.991
Isn't going to work.

01:32.992 --> 01:33.825
How do you know?

01:33.826 --> 01:36.094
Because I've already tried it!

01:37.830 --> 01:39.831
I'm done.

01:41.934 --> 01:44.202
The stargate aboard this ship
is much more primitive

01:44.203 --> 01:46.805
Than the later models
found in the milky way.

01:46.806 --> 01:50.175
As you can see from this map,
each time Destiny stops,

01:50.176 --> 01:52.911
It's in range
of only a small group of gates.

01:52.912 --> 01:55.614
That means the next time
we drop out of FTL,

01:55.615 --> 01:57.616
The planet the team
was stranded on

01:57.617 --> 02:00.018
Will no longer be
in range of Destiny.

02:00.019 --> 02:02.487
However, Dr. Rush and
Mr. Brody are working on...

02:04.857 --> 02:06.258
That's weird.

02:06.259 --> 02:07.859
What happened?

02:07.860 --> 02:09.761
Well, the battery
must have died.

02:09.762 --> 02:11.229
Okay.

02:11.230 --> 02:12.597
I just got this one
fresh out of the dispenser.

02:16.769 --> 02:18.804
It wasn't me.

02:18.805 --> 02:19.905
I am not
the sort of person

02:19.906 --> 02:21.673
Who just jumps into bed
with anyone.

02:21.674 --> 02:22.808
I had thought we...

02:27.213 --> 02:29.147
Colonel Young asked you
to check on me, didn't he?

02:29.148 --> 02:32.851
Yes, but he's asking me
to keep tabs on everybody.

02:32.852 --> 02:35.053
He believes in you.

02:35.054 --> 02:36.288
Well, he doesn't
have much choice.

02:36.289 --> 02:39.024
I'm also here because
I'm your friend.

02:40.860 --> 02:44.196
I'm sorry, it's just that...

02:46.232 --> 02:47.566
Rush, come in.

02:47.567 --> 02:48.967
Yeah, we've got
several systems down.

02:48.968 --> 02:51.837
Looks like Destiny's activated
some kind of power-saving mode.

02:51.838 --> 02:53.872
That's strange, because
our reserves are still

02:53.873 --> 02:55.106
At almost maximum current
capacity

02:55.107 --> 02:56.908
From the last
recharge.

02:56.909 --> 02:57.943
Life support's fine.

02:57.944 --> 02:59.945
I should be able to
work round it,

02:59.946 --> 03:01.580
Get the lights back on
in a couple of minutes.

03:01.581 --> 03:02.681
Maybe we shouldn't.

03:02.682 --> 03:03.815
What?

03:03.816 --> 03:05.250
Work around it.

03:05.251 --> 03:06.985
I mean, there's got to be a
good reason this is happening.

03:06.986 --> 03:08.954
This whole ship
is falling apart.

03:08.955 --> 03:10.188
Computers
don't last forever.

03:10.189 --> 03:11.957
Maybe it's a malfunction.

03:11.958 --> 03:13.692
Well, we're not going
to be able to do anything

03:13.693 --> 03:15.660
In the dark.

03:16.762 --> 03:19.297
We have two days
of water, tops.

03:19.298 --> 03:20.999
We'll find more.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.234
Step one,

03:22.235 --> 03:24.302
We get out of
these tunnels.

03:24.303 --> 03:26.171
We're off to a bad start.

03:26.172 --> 03:27.572
We'll find
food and water.

03:27.573 --> 03:28.874
They can't turn
the ship around.

03:28.875 --> 03:31.343
Then we'll use the gates
to catch up.

03:31.344 --> 03:34.246
In order to connect the dots
between here and the Destiny,

03:34.247 --> 03:36.281
There have to be gates
in range of each other

03:36.282 --> 03:39.818
Between this planet and
wherever Destiny stops next.

03:39.819 --> 03:43.088
Plus, this remote
only tells you

03:43.089 --> 03:44.990
Which gates are in range
of this planet,

03:44.991 --> 03:46.224
Not where they are.

03:46.225 --> 03:48.226
There's no way to know
which direction we'd be going.

03:48.227 --> 03:49.995
Oh, and in case
that's not bad enough,

03:49.996 --> 03:51.830
We have no idea

03:51.831 --> 03:53.365
Where Destiny went.

03:53.366 --> 03:54.733
Whoa, one step at a time.

03:54.734 --> 03:56.134
Yeah, let's all try and keep
a positive attitude.

04:03.843 --> 04:06.177
C4 blast could have
destabilized the whole place.

04:06.178 --> 04:07.112
Oh, that's just great.

04:07.113 --> 04:08.380
We had to take the risk.

04:08.381 --> 04:09.881
We're seriously...

04:09.882 --> 04:10.916
Eli.

04:16.221 --> 04:19.057
All we can do right
now is keep moving.

Son of a...

04:53.550 --> 04:54.884
So, what
do we know?

04:54.885 --> 04:56.118
Not much.

04:56.119 --> 04:57.420
Several
nonessential systems

04:57.421 --> 04:58.754
Automatically
shut down.

04:58.755 --> 05:01.458
We still only have
limited control.

05:01.459 --> 05:03.326
How about rescuing
the team we left behind?

05:03.327 --> 05:04.227
As I've said, Colonel,

05:04.228 --> 05:06.529
We won't know if the planet
they were left on is reachable

05:06.530 --> 05:08.865
Until we've
dropped out of FTL.

05:08.866 --> 05:10.466
This is crazy.

05:10.767 --> 05:12.034
You'd think some
of these tunnels

05:12.035 --> 05:13.736
Would lead somewhere.

05:13.737 --> 05:16.172
No wonder the people
that built this place died out.

05:16.173 --> 05:18.674
They probably all
got lost down here.

05:18.675 --> 05:20.643
Just wandered around thinking,

05:20.644 --> 05:22.812
"if only we had thought
to put in a few more exits."

05:22.813 --> 05:26.015
Or how about one of those maps
you see in a shopping mall

05:26.016 --> 05:27.116
With a big red dot.

05:27.117 --> 05:29.719
"you are here."

05:29.720 --> 05:31.888
How hard is that?

05:31.889 --> 05:33.789
I'd kill for
a big red dot right now.

05:33.790 --> 05:34.924
I can't take this
anymore.

05:34.925 --> 05:39.028
All right, let's stop,
take a quick breather.

05:39.029 --> 05:40.196
Five minutes.

05:40.197 --> 05:42.531
Thank God!

05:50.540 --> 05:51.941
Still looking for that kino?

05:51.942 --> 05:55.244
Uh, no.

05:55.245 --> 05:57.079
So what
are you doing?

05:57.080 --> 05:58.814
I've been thinking about
using the gates, actually.

05:58.815 --> 06:00.082
And?

06:02.519 --> 06:05.554
I may have painted an
overly bleak picture before.

06:05.555 --> 06:09.759
I'll admit,
I was freaking out a bit.

06:09.760 --> 06:10.960
And now?

06:11.962 --> 06:13.296
Well, we do know

06:13.297 --> 06:15.932
That Destiny is traveling
down a path,

06:15.933 --> 06:19.802
Basically
a corridor of gates

06:19.803 --> 06:21.637
Left behind by the ships
that were sent in advance.

06:21.638 --> 06:23.105
It meanders somewhat,

06:23.106 --> 06:26.075
But generally,
it heads in one direction.

06:26.076 --> 06:28.711
I mean, they wouldn't put gates
on every planet in every galaxy.

06:28.712 --> 06:30.246
Obviously not.

06:30.247 --> 06:32.014
People don't
realize

06:32.015 --> 06:33.683
How big a galaxy is.

06:33.684 --> 06:34.617
Anyway...

06:39.222 --> 06:43.492
Let's say the gates
in range of the planet we're on

06:43.493 --> 06:46.228
Are in this circle.

06:46.229 --> 06:48.664
This circle
represents

06:48.665 --> 06:53.002
The gates in range of Destiny

06:53.003 --> 06:54.537
The next time
it drops out of FTL.

06:54.538 --> 06:56.005
Okay, so we need to
get to that circle.

06:56.006 --> 06:57.640
Yeah, right.

06:57.641 --> 07:00.710
Now, hopefully, there are gates
in range of each other

07:00.711 --> 07:02.278
Between these circles.

07:02.279 --> 07:04.714
Once we are in range of
Destiny,

07:04.715 --> 07:07.283
The address will show up
on here.

07:07.284 --> 07:13.055
You see how easy it is
to make a simple map?

07:13.056 --> 07:15.191
Okay, so how do we know
we're going the right way?

07:16.593 --> 07:18.661
We don't,

07:18.662 --> 07:20.629
But if we do go
the wrong way,

07:20.630 --> 07:22.198
We'll either
run out of addresses

07:22.199 --> 07:23.833
Because we've hit the edge
of the corridor,

07:23.834 --> 07:25.868
Or we'll run into planets
we've been to before

07:25.869 --> 07:27.169
Or at least addresses

07:27.170 --> 07:29.638
I'll hopefully remember
or recognize, but...

07:29.639 --> 07:33.109
At least it's a 50-50 shot.

07:33.110 --> 07:34.844
Good.

07:37.647 --> 07:38.981
All right,
we should really get moving.

07:38.982 --> 07:40.883
Why? It hasn't been
five minutes.

07:40.884 --> 07:42.251
Eli, seriously!

07:56.033 --> 07:57.133
Are you seeing
what I'm seeing?

07:57.134 --> 08:00.202
Yeah.

08:00.203 --> 08:01.971
Well, I suspected
as much.

08:01.972 --> 08:03.873
Well, if it's true...

08:03.874 --> 08:05.241
I know.

08:05.242 --> 08:06.709
You're not going to tell Young?

08:06.710 --> 08:09.245
Well, it's not certain.

08:11.715 --> 08:13.349
You have to tell him.

08:19.156 --> 08:20.322
She's upset.

08:20.323 --> 08:21.590
We all are.

08:21.591 --> 08:24.093
But she's fine, though?

08:24.094 --> 08:25.261
I mean, I don't
have to worry

08:25.262 --> 08:26.562
About putting her
back out there?

08:26.563 --> 08:27.797
No.

08:27.798 --> 08:30.166
A few words of encouragement
from you

08:30.167 --> 08:31.500
Wouldn't hurt, though.

08:31.501 --> 08:32.735
She thinks you don't have
any confidence in her,

08:32.736 --> 08:34.870
That you're only
putting her out there

08:34.871 --> 08:36.005
Because you don't
have a choice...

08:36.006 --> 08:38.107
I don't.

08:38.107 --> 08:40.943
I know you think
she's a good soldier.

08:40.943 --> 08:42.211
Is she aware that I know

08:42.212 --> 08:43.745
About her previous
relationship with Scott?

08:43.746 --> 08:46.615
No.

08:46.616 --> 08:48.383
She's not over him, either,

08:48.384 --> 08:49.518
But that's not an issue.

08:49.519 --> 08:51.386
Thanks.

08:51.387 --> 08:53.221
Sir...

08:55.525 --> 08:59.227
There's something else I...

08:59.228 --> 09:00.629
Need to tell you.

09:00.630 --> 09:03.599
Well, that sounds serious.

09:04.467 --> 09:05.467
Colonel Young, come in.

09:05.468 --> 09:07.202
Rush, go ahead.

09:07.203 --> 09:09.338
You're going to
want to see this.

09:09.339 --> 09:11.173
I'll be
right there.

09:11.174 --> 09:13.375
So, you were going to say?

09:17.280 --> 09:19.348
It can wait.

09:19.349 --> 09:22.184
It's more of a
longer conversation.

09:22.185 --> 09:24.119
Okay.

09:29.859 --> 09:31.560
When I was left behind
on that planet

09:31.561 --> 09:32.894
With the crashed
alien ship...

09:32.895 --> 09:34.763
I remember.

09:34.764 --> 09:36.164
One of the things
I saw there

09:36.165 --> 09:37.633
Appeared to be a map
of this galaxy,

09:37.634 --> 09:38.533
Including
the stargates.

09:38.534 --> 09:40.068
And?

09:40.069 --> 09:42.437
Well, Mr. Brody and myself have
been working on our own map,

09:42.438 --> 09:44.172
Based on our own records

09:44.173 --> 09:46.441
Of where Destiny
has been thus far.

09:46.442 --> 09:48.644
I thought Destiny had a map
of where it's been.

09:48.645 --> 09:50.245
Yeah, but trying to create
a clearer picture

09:50.246 --> 09:51.513
Of the entire galaxy
we're in...

09:51.514 --> 09:53.248
Rush, just cut to the chase,
will you?

09:53.249 --> 09:55.651
I was hoping to have
some better news,

09:55.652 --> 09:57.552
But if I'm right...

09:57.553 --> 10:00.322
Then we are at the very edge
of this galaxy.

10:00.323 --> 10:01.723
Now, how is that bad news?

10:01.724 --> 10:03.291
We know that Destiny
travels between galaxies.

10:03.292 --> 10:07.229
Yeah, but the space
between galaxies is huge.

10:07.230 --> 10:09.031
Vast, empty.

10:09.032 --> 10:10.465
You think that's why that
power-saving protocol kicked in?

10:10.466 --> 10:11.933
I don't know,
it could be,

10:11.934 --> 10:14.469
But more importantly,
there will be no more gates.

10:15.805 --> 10:19.941
No chance of dialing
back to this system.

10:19.942 --> 10:21.510
If we don't find them

10:21.511 --> 10:24.680
The next time
we drop out of FTL...

10:24.681 --> 10:28.316
We won't have another chance.

10:39.586 --> 10:41.186
Oh, my God!

10:41.187 --> 10:42.254
What?

10:42.255 --> 10:44.490
The kino.

10:44.491 --> 10:46.658
Look, look, an exit!

10:46.659 --> 10:49.561
The kino found an exit.

10:49.562 --> 10:51.163
That's awesome.
Where's the kino?

10:51.164 --> 10:52.431
I have no idea.

10:52.432 --> 10:53.532
Right.
Exactly.

10:53.533 --> 10:55.901
Come on, at least
now we know

10:55.902 --> 10:58.304
That there is
a way out of here.

10:58.305 --> 11:00.039
Left or right?
What's it going to be?

11:00.040 --> 11:02.141
We're traveling blind,

11:02.142 --> 11:03.442
So what difference
does it make?

11:03.443 --> 11:05.211
Left.
I like left.

11:05.212 --> 11:08.080
No offence to what
you like, man, but...

11:08.081 --> 11:09.882
No.

11:09.883 --> 11:11.116
He's right.
We should go left.

11:14.020 --> 11:15.120
How do you know
for sure?

11:15.121 --> 11:18.490
Because that's what
this map says.

11:20.860 --> 11:24.029
There's been a few
of these along the way.

11:24.030 --> 11:28.167
I thought they were just
decorative at first.

11:28.168 --> 11:30.469
So far they've been the same
except for one thing.

11:30.470 --> 11:33.472
This symbol seems to be
in different places.

11:36.109 --> 11:38.143
"you are here."

11:38.144 --> 11:41.313
There have been maps down here
this whole time?

11:41.314 --> 11:42.982
That's awesome.
Are you sure?

11:42.983 --> 11:46.852
Well, this seems to be
the fork we're standing at.

11:46.853 --> 11:50.923
Yeah, well, there's only
one way to find out.

11:50.924 --> 11:52.291
What are you doing?

11:52.292 --> 11:55.327
Going to go look
for another one.

11:57.797 --> 11:59.498
Greer!

12:02.969 --> 12:05.204
Greer!

12:10.176 --> 12:13.212
She's right.
There's another map...

12:18.852 --> 12:22.388
Greer!

12:26.326 --> 12:28.027
I tried.

12:28.028 --> 12:29.528
I did, really!

12:29.529 --> 12:31.130
I was about to tell him,

12:31.131 --> 12:32.598
And then he got called away
by Rush.

12:32.599 --> 12:34.266
Well, you should have
told him anyway.

12:34.267 --> 12:36.869
It just, it sounded important.

12:36.870 --> 12:38.337
So is this.

12:38.338 --> 12:40.439
I know.

12:40.440 --> 12:42.174
He's going to
find out soon enough.

12:42.175 --> 12:44.143
I mean, you're starting to
show.

12:44.144 --> 12:46.578
I know.

12:46.579 --> 12:48.147
Are you afraid of
what he's going to say?

12:50.050 --> 12:52.484
Or not say, I don't know.

12:52.485 --> 12:54.953
Go tell him right now.

12:54.954 --> 12:57.589
It just seems like
there's always something.

13:02.429 --> 13:04.263
Matt!

13:04.264 --> 13:06.398
I'm fine.

13:06.399 --> 13:07.399
Oh, my God.

13:07.400 --> 13:09.368
Greer!

13:11.538 --> 13:14.139
Greer!

13:14.140 --> 13:16.942
Come in, Greer!

13:16.943 --> 13:19.244
Ron, can you hear me?

13:19.245 --> 13:22.981
Maybe the signal can't
penetrate the rocks.

13:22.982 --> 13:27.453
We could hear James
pretty clearly.

13:38.531 --> 13:40.165
Three hours.

13:40.166 --> 13:41.633
Besides dialing,

13:41.634 --> 13:43.369
Checking for
safe environment,

13:43.370 --> 13:45.371
Roughly eight
to ten minutes per planet.

13:45.372 --> 13:47.373
Factor in time to get back,

13:47.374 --> 13:50.509
We'll be able to see
roughly 20 planets.

13:50.510 --> 13:53.445
At least we know
the direction to go in.

13:53.446 --> 13:55.280
We'll find them,
sir.

13:55.281 --> 13:57.082
Good luck.

13:58.485 --> 14:00.986
Colonel, it's TJ, come in?

14:00.987 --> 14:02.654
Go ahead.

14:02.655 --> 14:04.056
Have they left?

14:04.057 --> 14:05.290
Yes.

14:05.291 --> 14:07.259
Unfortunately,
it's a very short window.

14:07.260 --> 14:10.028
Do you have some time
to talk in private?

14:10.029 --> 14:11.530
I'm just on my way
to see to Dr. Volker,

14:11.531 --> 14:13.565
Talk about the charging plates,
putting them back online.

14:13.566 --> 14:15.601
Nothing seems to be
working around here.

14:15.602 --> 14:17.169
Can it wait?

14:23.209 --> 14:25.210
Greer!

14:25.211 --> 14:26.645
Come on, buddy!

14:26.646 --> 14:28.147
Greer!

14:28.148 --> 14:31.083
Ow, wait, wait, wait!

14:34.254 --> 14:36.021
All right, stop,
stop, stop!

14:36.022 --> 14:37.723
Stop moving rocks.

14:39.426 --> 14:41.226
We need to get out of here.

14:43.563 --> 14:46.465
Look, I saw those rocks
coming down. It...

14:46.466 --> 14:49.668
I know he would want us
to get out of here alive,

14:49.669 --> 14:51.637
Especially if there
was no hope for him.

14:51.638 --> 14:53.005
Are you just saying that

14:53.006 --> 14:54.239
Because you think you need
to get us out of here?

14:56.209 --> 14:57.509
Gear up.

14:57.510 --> 14:58.777
Give me a second here.

14:58.778 --> 15:00.045
Just... Go.

15:10.356 --> 15:11.690
Look, Greer?

15:14.394 --> 15:17.763
I'm sorry, man.

15:24.504 --> 15:26.605
Go! Move, move, move,
this thing's coming down.

15:32.473 --> 15:33.640
Please.

15:33.808 --> 15:35.075
The boy has to eat.

15:35.076 --> 15:37.978
Look, don't you
go near there.

15:37.979 --> 15:39.580
You got to
let him out.

15:39.581 --> 15:40.714
I don't got to
do nothing!

15:44.419 --> 15:46.887
Mom?

15:46.888 --> 15:49.823
The boy
has to learn.

16:07.175 --> 16:09.476
Hello!

16:11.946 --> 16:13.113
Hey, you guys,
can anybody hear me?

16:13.114 --> 16:17.951
I'm here!

16:24.726 --> 16:27.928
Scott, this is Greer, come in.

16:27.929 --> 16:29.930
Come in...

16:33.101 --> 16:37.004
Hey, at least the
tremors have stopped.

16:37.005 --> 16:40.874
Probably got far enough
from the cave-in.

17:07.669 --> 17:09.670
I'll go.

17:59.020 --> 18:01.855
Done.

18:08.630 --> 18:10.230
Done.

18:30.819 --> 18:33.253
He wasn't
always like this.

18:33.254 --> 18:35.722
You say that
all the time.

18:35.723 --> 18:38.592
He was a good man,

18:38.593 --> 18:39.893
A good father.

18:39.894 --> 18:40.994
You were too young
to remember.

18:40.995 --> 18:42.129
I hate him.

18:42.130 --> 18:44.164
It's not his fault.

18:44.165 --> 18:45.732
Don't care.

18:45.733 --> 18:47.067
You need to be strong.

18:47.068 --> 18:48.602
I know you got it in you.

18:48.603 --> 18:52.906
He needs us,
both of us.

18:52.907 --> 18:54.741
Nobody else
is going to take care of him.

18:55.877 --> 18:57.044
We need to go.

18:57.045 --> 18:59.246
Where?

18:59.247 --> 19:01.715
Far away. Both of us.

19:01.716 --> 19:02.950
We need to get out of here.

19:31.079 --> 19:32.946
Eli, hold up
a second.

19:33.915 --> 19:34.915
What?

19:56.137 --> 19:58.338
I'm saying maybe
the thing to do is stay put.

19:58.339 --> 20:00.107
If it is possible
to connect the dots

20:00.108 --> 20:01.241
Between here and Destiny,

20:01.242 --> 20:02.943
Then Colonel Young is
going to send a team

20:02.944 --> 20:04.211
Back to look for us.

20:04.212 --> 20:05.479
Maybe we'd be
better off

20:05.480 --> 20:06.713
Waiting for them
to find us.

20:06.714 --> 20:07.714
We don't know
how long

20:07.715 --> 20:08.749
Destiny is
going to stop for.

20:08.750 --> 20:10.150
If it's a short window,

20:10.151 --> 20:11.385
There might not be enough
time for them to get here,

20:11.386 --> 20:14.721
And then to gate
back to Destiny?

20:14.722 --> 20:17.124
We need to take the chance.

20:32.407 --> 20:34.341
Okay, dial it.

20:47.922 --> 20:50.190
It's hard to see.

20:51.993 --> 20:53.160
Looks pretty foggy,

20:53.161 --> 20:55.829
But everything else is good.

20:57.465 --> 20:58.532
It's safe to go.

21:38.006 --> 21:39.940
Get out.

21:43.745 --> 21:44.945
Get out.

21:44.946 --> 21:47.247
I don't have any money.

21:47.248 --> 21:50.517
Probably a good thing
down here.

22:10.905 --> 22:11.905
Matt?

22:33.761 --> 22:34.928
It'll take a minute

22:34.929 --> 22:37.264
For the gate list
to refresh.

22:37.265 --> 22:39.466
If Destiny's in FTL,
it won't show up, right?

22:39.467 --> 22:41.101
Right.

22:41.102 --> 22:42.402
So shouldn't we
be spending

22:42.403 --> 22:44.071
A little more time
on these planets?

22:44.072 --> 22:45.172
Waiting to see if it does?

22:45.173 --> 22:48.241
What if it is out of FTL,

22:48.242 --> 22:50.110
But just one planet
away from here?

22:50.111 --> 22:51.812
See, I knew
this was a bad idea.

22:51.813 --> 22:53.547
Weren't you
the one who said

22:53.548 --> 22:54.948
We should stop being
so negative?

22:54.949 --> 22:57.017
10 minutes.

22:57.018 --> 22:58.118
We give each planet...

23:03.057 --> 23:04.291
You hear that?

23:04.292 --> 23:05.559
Of course we heard it.

23:06.794 --> 23:07.894
Dial the gate.

23:07.895 --> 23:10.030
I'm dialing.

23:10.031 --> 23:11.198
Dial faster.

23:11.199 --> 23:12.132
I'm dialing,
I'm dialing!

23:49.087 --> 23:50.421
Eli!

23:55.561 --> 23:59.330
Holy...

24:30.863 --> 24:32.964
Mom! Mom!

24:39.070 --> 24:41.838
Mom! Mom!

24:41.839 --> 24:43.774
Mom, we have to go!
Mom, wake up!

25:04.662 --> 25:07.798
You should've
let me burn.

25:19.110 --> 25:20.610
It's beautiful.

25:20.611 --> 25:22.612
Not that I'd want
to be stuck here

25:22.613 --> 25:23.814
For a long time,

25:23.815 --> 25:25.615
But it is an incredible
sight to see.

25:27.118 --> 25:28.185
Yes.

25:28.186 --> 25:29.686
This is our
tenth planet.

25:29.687 --> 25:31.521
We have less than
an hour and a half left.

25:31.522 --> 25:34.057
This is a lot more complicated
than I'd anticipated.

25:34.058 --> 25:35.759
Who would have guessed

25:35.760 --> 25:37.027
That Destiny had skipped over
so many planets

25:37.028 --> 25:38.261
With gates on them?

25:38.262 --> 25:39.930
Getting back should be
much quicker, though.

25:39.931 --> 25:41.965
Yes.

25:41.966 --> 25:43.633
Well, we have
extra kinos and a remote.

25:43.634 --> 25:45.168
Maybe it's time to split up,
cover more planets.

25:45.169 --> 25:47.137
Agreed.

25:47.138 --> 25:49.673
We're going to find them.

25:49.674 --> 25:50.941
We just need a bit of luck.

25:50.942 --> 25:52.876
I'm afraid
I don't believe in that.

25:54.779 --> 25:56.747
So you'll take one team
and I'll take the other?

26:06.791 --> 26:09.292
The fires...

26:09.293 --> 26:10.694
The fires were everywhere.

26:10.695 --> 26:11.895
That oil burned hot.

26:11.896 --> 26:13.697
Got so we forgot

26:13.698 --> 26:15.565
What a clean breath of air
felt like.

26:15.566 --> 26:17.968
Emphysema,
asthma, bronchitis.

26:17.969 --> 26:19.703
They said none of the guys
sent in to put out the fires

26:19.704 --> 26:20.971
Showed any ill effects.

26:20.972 --> 26:22.739
Come on, you buy that?

26:22.740 --> 26:23.874
How can that be true?

26:23.875 --> 26:25.642
Those fires were everywhere...

26:25.643 --> 26:27.711
The man's
a living hell.

26:27.712 --> 26:33.283
Sent by the devil himself
to torture me for all eternity.

26:33.284 --> 26:34.885
Just a little skin
reaction, they said.

26:34.886 --> 26:37.220
Just a little itchy on the arm.

26:37.221 --> 26:38.722
The FDA approved it

26:38.723 --> 26:40.190
Even though it'd never
been through

26:40.191 --> 26:42.292
Any serious
large-scale trials.

26:42.293 --> 26:43.727
There were no
side effects.

26:43.728 --> 26:44.895
They said
it was the war,

26:44.896 --> 26:47.831
Not the vaccine.

26:47.832 --> 26:49.132
Between 1998
and 2000,

26:49.133 --> 26:51.334
20,000 soldiers
had to be hospitalized

26:51.335 --> 26:52.903
After receiving the vaccine

26:52.904 --> 26:55.639
Even though they had never
been deployed overseas.

26:55.640 --> 26:58.308
The pentagon failed
to report that to congress!

26:58.309 --> 27:01.178
Wasn't as bad as
the sand fleas, though.

27:01.179 --> 27:02.813
They got under
your skin and how.

27:02.814 --> 27:04.714
Carried all kinds of diseases.

27:04.715 --> 27:06.316
Diseases you can't even say.

27:06.317 --> 27:08.018
Tank busters.

27:08.019 --> 27:09.953
Uranium depleted.
I loaded those munitions.

27:09.954 --> 27:12.222
Nothing dangerous
coming off those.

27:12.223 --> 27:14.124
What do you think?

27:14.125 --> 27:16.726
18,000 times in two years
those alarms went off.

27:16.727 --> 27:19.095
It's not the mustard gas,
never the mustard gas!

27:19.096 --> 27:20.263
It was cigarettes.

27:20.264 --> 27:22.299
Deodorant!
Can you believe that?

27:22.300 --> 27:24.267
Chronic fatigue,
loss of muscle control,

27:24.268 --> 27:26.369
Headaches, dizziness,
memory loss,

27:26.370 --> 27:28.104
Shortness of breath,
brain cancer...

27:28.105 --> 27:29.639
I'm going to kill him.

27:29.640 --> 27:30.874
Put him out of his misery.

27:30.875 --> 27:32.375
It was the war.

27:32.376 --> 27:33.610
It was the war!

27:33.611 --> 27:34.811
It wasn't the fires.

27:34.812 --> 27:36.313
They were everywhere.

27:36.314 --> 27:37.948
Big black billowing smoke.

27:37.949 --> 27:39.182
The war is why he can't
breathe.

27:56.767 --> 27:57.968
Hey, TJ!

27:57.969 --> 27:59.636
Listen, I'm sorry.

27:59.637 --> 28:01.171
One thing turned
into another,

28:01.172 --> 28:02.372
And the next thing I know,
a five-minute update is...

28:02.373 --> 28:03.840
I'm pregnant.

28:13.784 --> 28:15.085
You're pregnant?

28:26.797 --> 28:28.198
How far along are you?

28:31.269 --> 28:33.970
About 22 weeks.

28:33.971 --> 28:35.805
It's yours.

28:35.806 --> 28:39.376
Ours.

28:41.779 --> 28:44.981
A baby.

28:44.982 --> 28:48.018
On this ship...

28:49.987 --> 28:53.290
I'm keeping it.

28:53.291 --> 28:56.793
No, I didn't...
I didn't say you shouldn't.

28:59.697 --> 29:01.164
What are you saying?

29:17.148 --> 29:18.982
We're going to...
we're going to make this work.

29:18.983 --> 29:22.285
We're going to do it,
we're going to make it work.

29:22.286 --> 29:23.420
Okay?

29:43.975 --> 29:47.043
This is a problem.

29:47.044 --> 29:48.812
What?

29:48.813 --> 29:50.313
The kino says

29:50.314 --> 29:52.816
The atmosphere on the planet
we just sent it to is toxic.

29:52.817 --> 29:53.883
We can't go through.

29:53.884 --> 29:56.453
Which means we can't
get that kino back.

29:56.454 --> 29:57.854
And we won't know
if the next address we try

29:57.855 --> 29:58.955
Is safe.

29:58.956 --> 30:00.423
Dial another one.

30:00.424 --> 30:01.958
But I just said that...

30:01.959 --> 30:02.959
I know, I know,

30:02.960 --> 30:03.994
But we can't
stay here, can we?

30:03.995 --> 30:05.195
No, no, but I...

30:05.196 --> 30:06.062
You stay,
I'll go, I'll go.

30:06.063 --> 30:07.163
I'll radio back
if it's safe.

30:07.164 --> 30:08.398
Matt, no.

30:08.399 --> 30:09.899
Look, we stay here,

30:09.900 --> 30:11.034
We're as good
as dead anyway.

30:11.035 --> 30:12.068
Dial another one.

30:15.106 --> 30:17.707
They left you.

30:17.708 --> 30:20.377
Abandoned you.

30:20.378 --> 30:25.115
They did whathey had to do.

30:25.116 --> 30:26.349
They thought I was dead.

30:26.350 --> 30:29.819
Nobody's
going to save you.

30:29.820 --> 30:33.023
Nobody cares.

30:33.024 --> 30:37.927
In the end, all there is
is you.

30:39.864 --> 30:42.966
You alone.

30:48.839 --> 30:50.840
Doctor says

30:50.841 --> 30:52.809
There's an infection
in his brain.

30:52.810 --> 30:54.944
They say there's nothing
they can do for him.

30:58.182 --> 31:00.050
I enlisted.

31:00.051 --> 31:02.786
What'd you go and do that for?

31:05.022 --> 31:06.156
I didn't get the scholarship.

31:06.157 --> 31:07.757
But you worked so hard.

31:07.758 --> 31:10.960
Wasn't fast enough.

31:10.961 --> 31:13.296
You always said
it wasn't his fault.

31:15.266 --> 31:17.934
His choice
wasn't wrong.

31:17.935 --> 31:20.136
He just wanted to be somebody.

31:20.137 --> 31:23.973
I want to be somebody.

31:23.974 --> 31:26.843
You don't have anything
to prove to anyone.

31:26.844 --> 31:30.080
You didn't let him
change you.

31:30.081 --> 31:31.815
Nothing can hurt
the spirit God gave you...

31:31.816 --> 31:35.151
I have to use it.

31:35.152 --> 31:37.954
Don't I?

31:37.955 --> 31:39.322
To make a difference.

31:43.994 --> 31:48.832
You can still
change your mind.

31:48.833 --> 31:50.100
I'm not going to.

32:20.731 --> 32:22.765
All right, I'm okay.

32:22.766 --> 32:24.501
It's cold and dark,

32:24.502 --> 32:26.002
But I can breathe,

32:26.003 --> 32:27.437
And there's no crazy dinosaurs,

32:27.438 --> 32:29.506
At least not yet.

32:29.507 --> 32:31.508
Come on through.

32:47.091 --> 32:49.259
It's kind of pretty.

32:52.830 --> 32:53.997
Sometimes
we would spend christmas

32:53.998 --> 32:55.765
At a cabin in Vermont.

32:55.766 --> 32:58.268
Amazing...

32:58.269 --> 32:59.969
That a planet on the other side
of the universe

32:59.970 --> 33:02.839
Can remind you of Vermont.

33:06.043 --> 33:08.077
Okay.

33:08.078 --> 33:09.179
Here we go,

33:09.180 --> 33:12.549
The next set
of addresses.

33:12.550 --> 33:14.484
Oh, God...

33:14.485 --> 33:16.286
What?

33:16.287 --> 33:17.687
I recognize this one.

33:17.688 --> 33:18.988
One we've
been to before?

33:18.989 --> 33:21.257
Not recently.

33:21.258 --> 33:22.658
That's not good.

33:22.659 --> 33:24.627
It's the one with the
downed alien ship.

33:24.628 --> 33:29.965
The... The planet
Rush was stranded on.

33:29.966 --> 33:31.667
We've been heading
the wrong way.

33:38.948 --> 33:41.516
Okay, so what now?

33:41.517 --> 33:43.685
Can we retrace
our steps?

33:43.686 --> 33:45.754
Wait...

33:46.255 --> 33:47.289
No.

33:47.290 --> 33:49.391
We should go
to this planet.

33:49.392 --> 33:50.625
Why?

33:50.626 --> 33:52.560
Look, even if we
retrace our steps

33:52.561 --> 33:55.397
And try this all again
with different choices,

33:55.598 --> 33:58.333
We're traveling blind.

33:58.334 --> 34:00.568
Rush said he we was able
to boot up the computer

34:00.569 --> 34:02.003
On that alien ship.

34:02.004 --> 34:03.404
Yea, and that's what
brought the aliens.

34:03.405 --> 34:05.306
Yes, but in the small
time that he was there,

34:05.307 --> 34:07.275
He was able to glean
some information

34:07.276 --> 34:09.409
About the shape of this galaxy

34:09.411 --> 34:10.478
And where the stargates are.

34:10.478 --> 34:14.382
If I can do the same,

34:14.382 --> 34:16.518
We won't have
to stumble around.

34:16.518 --> 34:19.786
We'd have a map.

34:19.788 --> 34:22.657
Okay, but
what about the aliens?

34:22.658 --> 34:24.893
Believe me, you do not
want to end up a prisoner

34:24.893 --> 34:26.293
On one of those ships.

34:26.295 --> 34:28.830
I realize we might
not have much time.

34:28.831 --> 34:31.431
We'll have to get
in and out quickly.

34:31.433 --> 34:34.335
If they're not there now.

35:05.267 --> 35:06.434
Lieutenant.

35:35.631 --> 35:39.534
I hope
this is a good idea.

35:46.242 --> 35:48.376
All right, come on.

35:58.821 --> 36:00.221
Hey, Eli?

36:00.222 --> 36:01.389
How about this?

36:15.938 --> 36:17.805
Guess we're in
the right place.

36:17.806 --> 36:19.674
Well, I didn't see any
other alien spaceships,

36:19.675 --> 36:21.242
Did you?

36:21.243 --> 36:22.410
Come on, clock is ticking.

36:22.411 --> 36:25.413
I know, I know.

36:33.555 --> 36:34.856
15 minutes.

36:34.857 --> 36:36.858
Where'd you get
that number?

36:36.859 --> 36:38.860
I like it.

36:38.861 --> 36:42.463
This is an alien spaceship.

36:42.464 --> 36:43.598
Right, exactly.
15 minutes, that is it.

36:43.599 --> 36:44.666
End of discussion.

36:55.344 --> 36:56.978
Nice work, Lieutenant.

36:56.979 --> 36:59.614
Thank you, sir.

36:59.615 --> 37:00.615
Any word from Rush?

37:00.616 --> 37:01.949
Not yet.

37:03.385 --> 37:04.819
I'm glad you made it back.

37:04.820 --> 37:07.288
Yes, sir.

37:08.857 --> 37:11.793
Sergeant?

37:11.794 --> 37:13.761
They thought I was dead.

37:13.762 --> 37:15.563
I don't think they would have
left me otherwise.

37:15.564 --> 37:20.802
I just hope that choice
doesn't mean we've lost them.

37:29.044 --> 37:31.579
None of this makes any sense.

37:32.981 --> 37:34.415
Okay, time's up,
we need to walk away.

37:34.416 --> 37:35.717
Not yet.

37:35.718 --> 37:37.151
Wait.

37:37.152 --> 37:38.319
You just said none of this
makes any sense...

37:38.320 --> 37:39.520
I know. I know.

37:39.521 --> 37:41.356
Eli...

37:41.357 --> 37:43.624
Go back.

37:43.625 --> 37:44.859
What do you mean?

37:44.860 --> 37:46.461
The screens,
go back.

37:50.666 --> 37:52.500
There!

37:52.501 --> 37:53.568
Select that.

38:00.743 --> 38:02.910
There it is.

38:02.911 --> 38:04.812
How did you
know that?

38:04.813 --> 38:07.048
I don't know.

38:07.049 --> 38:08.816
Can you read this?

38:08.817 --> 38:09.917
No, I just...

38:09.918 --> 38:11.619
Know what it means?

38:11.620 --> 38:13.654
Look, can you use this

38:13.655 --> 38:14.756
To get us back to Destiny
or not?

38:14.757 --> 38:17.959
Uh... Yes?

38:17.960 --> 38:19.060
Yes.

38:19.061 --> 38:21.462
I think so.

38:23.599 --> 38:24.665
We have to hurry, though.

38:24.666 --> 38:25.700
Why?

38:25.701 --> 38:28.569
If I'm reading this right,

38:28.570 --> 38:30.938
Then Destiny is about
to leave the galaxy.

38:30.939 --> 38:32.673
If we don't get back on board
before it does,

38:32.674 --> 38:35.777
We're going to be
stranded for good.

38:35.778 --> 38:38.780
Game over.

38:45.053 --> 38:48.156
Five minutes.

38:54.763 --> 38:56.030
Okay...

38:56.031 --> 38:58.132
Seriously,
there was no quicker way?

38:58.133 --> 38:59.734
No.

38:59.735 --> 39:02.937
If I'm right,
this planet should be just...

39:02.938 --> 39:04.038
There it is!

39:04.039 --> 39:05.006
Destiny!

39:05.007 --> 39:06.007
Dial, dial, dial!

39:06.008 --> 39:07.475
Okay.

39:13.715 --> 39:15.082
Down to the wire.

39:15.083 --> 39:18.119
Incoming wormhole.

39:42.444 --> 39:43.511
You cut it close.

39:43.512 --> 39:44.612
Greer.

39:44.613 --> 39:46.013
And the others
were not with him.

39:51.453 --> 39:52.553
What happened?

39:52.554 --> 39:53.754
I don't know.

39:53.755 --> 39:54.789
It didn't connect.

39:54.790 --> 39:55.823
Why not?

39:55.824 --> 39:56.824
I don't know!

39:58.594 --> 39:59.794
So where are they?

39:59.795 --> 40:00.728
Dial it again.

40:00.729 --> 40:02.563
Dial it again!

40:02.564 --> 40:03.698
Yeah, yeah, okay.

40:34.997 --> 40:35.963
What happened?

40:35.964 --> 40:37.999
I said I don't...

40:38.000 --> 40:40.568
Oh, God!

40:40.569 --> 40:42.069
What?

40:42.070 --> 40:43.237
The address just disappeared.

40:43.238 --> 40:44.739
How can it be there
one second

40:44.740 --> 40:45.940
And gone the next?

40:48.577 --> 40:49.644
They jumped.

40:51.713 --> 40:55.082
We missed it.

40:55.083 --> 40:56.851
We must have just...

40:56.852 --> 40:58.886
Missed it.

41:07.129 --> 41:10.831
That's it.

41:10.832 --> 41:12.233
We're done.

41:25.981 --> 41:27.181
I'm trying to carry on for Eli.

41:27.182 --> 41:28.649
Don't you think
he'd want me to?

41:28.650 --> 41:31.118
I mean, I think
it's important.

41:31.119 --> 41:33.120
Look, I know you've
been through a lot.

41:33.121 --> 41:35.890
I only need
a minute or two.

41:35.891 --> 41:38.759
What happened on the planet?

41:38.760 --> 41:40.628
People are going to
want to hear your story,

41:40.629 --> 41:42.296
You know.

41:46.835 --> 41:49.236
Maybe another time.
