<i>Previously on Camelot...</i>

00:03.586 --> 00:07.121
- Are you really a sorcerer?
- I don't care what you believe.

00:07.188 --> 00:09.057
But I've sworn off those powers
a long time ago.

00:09.125 --> 00:12.070
- Why?
- Because they cost.

00:12.138 --> 00:15.615
It's over.
This was it. The once.

00:15.683 --> 00:19.121
Now we must never talk of it.
I have to get ready for my wedding.

00:19.189 --> 00:21.663
Every woman in this village is
protected. By my men,

00:21.731 --> 00:25.167
by my flag.
Exham is now part of Camelot.

00:25.234 --> 00:27.603
We understand
he is your brother,

00:27.671 --> 00:31.543
but the land moves further
into chaos every day.

00:31.611 --> 00:33.511
Everything
that was once so secure

00:33.579 --> 00:36.948
under my father's reign is
now under threat.

When Zeus asked his daughter,
Artemis,

02:24.549 --> 02:27.985
what she would like
for her third birthday,

02:28.053 --> 02:31.122
she requested
that he grant her 6 wishes.

02:33.058 --> 02:35.025
The first wish was

02:35.093 --> 02:37.528
that she be allowed
to live her life

02:37.596 --> 02:40.231
without the distraction
of love or marriage.

02:40.299 --> 02:43.901
<i>The second wish was</i>
<i>to be the bringer of life...</i>

02:49.708 --> 02:53.011
Guinevere!
There's a messenger here to see you.

02:53.079 --> 02:55.114
He says it's urgent.

02:57.751 --> 02:59.852
Coming, Bridget.

03:06.595 --> 03:09.698
- Come on!
- Up!

03:09.765 --> 03:11.333
Come again!

03:17.308 --> 03:19.710
- Camelot!
- Come on lads,

03:19.778 --> 03:23.147
put your backsides into it,
would you! King's orders.

03:23.216 --> 03:25.150
Push!

03:25.218 --> 03:28.688
- Bloody hell, it's a big territory.
- Stick it well in, now.

03:28.756 --> 03:31.958
- You really think these will make a difference?
- The king does.

03:32.026 --> 03:34.361
Well, they look good.
Until they're pulled

03:34.429 --> 03:36.397
out of the ground
and used for firewood.

03:36.465 --> 03:38.432
These banners push
our message further.

03:38.500 --> 03:40.702
They tell people they're
in King Arthur's land--

03:40.769 --> 03:42.570
that they're protected.

03:42.638 --> 03:45.140
On your horses, all of you.
We've work to do.

03:45.207 --> 03:46.775
What do you mean?

03:46.843 --> 03:48.977
We're doing the work.

03:49.045 --> 03:52.448
We've a higher priority.
We're going to your old home.

03:52.516 --> 03:54.050
Why?

03:54.117 --> 03:56.385
For the library
your father put together.

03:56.453 --> 03:59.289
That doesn't need all of us,
Sorcerer.

03:59.356 --> 04:02.325
Books are as valuable to us
as gold.

04:02.393 --> 04:04.827
- Oh, he knows that.
- We should have done this

04:04.895 --> 04:08.264
sooner. We have an armoury,
we need a library.

04:08.332 --> 04:10.299
So, let's go.

04:13.603 --> 04:15.905
Are you all right?

04:15.972 --> 04:17.706
Yes.

04:17.774 --> 04:20.976
I just never thought
I'd be going back there.

04:33.490 --> 04:36.526
We're moving too slowly.
The floors need to be made safe.

04:36.594 --> 04:38.761
More rooms cleared
for living space.

04:38.829 --> 04:40.764
Strip out the plants
and overgrowth.

04:40.831 --> 04:44.000
Oh, and we'll need, uh, rafters to
repair the roof in the Great Hall.

04:44.068 --> 04:46.502
Your Highness. Arthur.
Guinevere's gone!

04:46.570 --> 04:48.004
What do you mean, gone?

04:48.072 --> 04:50.006
She rode out just now
by herself.

04:50.074 --> 04:52.809
I'm sorry, I didn't know who else to talk to.
Where did she go?

04:52.876 --> 04:56.413
You should talk
to the messenger.

04:56.480 --> 04:59.716
Her father, Leodegrance, he's sick.
He has only a few days to live.

04:59.784 --> 05:01.718
He sent me from the Fenlands
in the east to summon her.

05:01.785 --> 05:03.686
But with the length
of the journey,

05:03.754 --> 05:06.689
he may be dead already.
Can we send some men out after her?

05:06.757 --> 05:08.691
No, most are already out
marking the territories.

05:08.759 --> 05:11.795
- She's not safe out there on her own!
- I'll go.

05:11.862 --> 05:15.365
Make way!
Make way for the king!

05:15.432 --> 05:18.735
How long have
they been waiting?

05:18.803 --> 05:20.904
They started coming
at sunrise.

05:20.971 --> 05:24.573
They all want the same thing-- to
have the ear of the king's sister.

05:24.641 --> 05:26.375
I told you they'd come.

05:26.443 --> 05:29.044
Your influence can only grow
from this.

05:51.967 --> 05:54.236
Don't kneel.

05:54.304 --> 05:57.373
Tell me
why you're here.

05:57.440 --> 05:59.208
It's about my boy.

05:59.276 --> 06:01.845
Me and his father, we haven't
been together for 7 years--

06:01.912 --> 06:03.947
he went off with another woman.
Now he wants the boy

06:04.014 --> 06:05.949
to help with the labour
on his farm.

06:06.017 --> 06:08.584
But his father didn't raise him,
I did. He should stay with me.

06:08.652 --> 06:10.920
And you came to me
so I would settle your feud?

06:10.987 --> 06:14.356
I've brought you a gift:
some milk from my herd.

06:16.793 --> 06:19.293
You're the father.

06:19.361 --> 06:21.295
Why should you have him?

06:21.362 --> 06:23.597
She's always kept him
from me.

06:23.665 --> 06:26.232
I need help
with the work.

06:26.300 --> 06:29.002
He's old enough to be called on.
And he's the only family I have.

06:31.940 --> 06:34.876
Do you both swear
to abide by my decision?

06:34.944 --> 06:36.945
- Yes.
- I do.

06:43.987 --> 06:46.723
Then I'll buy the child
from you.

06:46.791 --> 06:48.392
What?!

06:48.460 --> 06:51.061
For a good price.

06:51.129 --> 06:52.469
He can live here as a servant.

06:52.494 --> 06:56.107
- Five goats in exchange for him.
- That's not why I came!

06:56.535 --> 06:58.770
Five goats
and 2 sheep.

06:58.837 --> 07:01.038
No.

07:01.106 --> 07:05.643
Ten goats and 5 sheep.
He's young,

07:05.711 --> 07:08.479
but he'll grow strong.
You'll get good work from him.

07:08.546 --> 07:11.482
- Seven goats, 3 sheep.
- You can't do this!

07:11.550 --> 07:14.318
- Nine goats--
- Eight.

07:14.385 --> 07:17.754
And 3 sheep.
The boy's yours for that.

07:17.822 --> 07:19.923
Immediate payment.
No!

07:19.991 --> 07:22.626
Good!

07:22.693 --> 07:24.861
The child stays
with his mother!

07:24.929 --> 07:26.796
What?

07:26.864 --> 07:28.932
We just made a deal!

07:29.000 --> 07:30.967
You bartered your son
for nothing.

07:31.035 --> 07:34.905
You're not worthy
to be called a father. Get out.

07:34.972 --> 07:36.507
Go on! Out with you!

07:36.574 --> 07:38.442
Thank you.

07:51.222 --> 07:53.890
You have a good mother.

07:53.958 --> 07:56.894
Treasure her.

08:03.134 --> 08:04.735
Next!

08:22.921 --> 08:25.489
Whoever attacked them could
still be here.

08:46.447 --> 08:48.715
Help.

08:50.651 --> 08:52.418
It's all right.

08:52.486 --> 08:55.721
- My wife...
- Don't move.

08:55.789 --> 08:57.389
Did they spare her?

09:04.363 --> 09:06.597
Whoever they were,
they've moved on.

09:09.101 --> 09:11.602
Am I dying?

09:16.674 --> 09:19.543
Yes.
Whatever you believe in,

09:19.611 --> 09:21.846
now's the time
to make your peace.

09:23.749 --> 09:26.818
- Can't you help him?
- Can't you?

09:26.885 --> 09:29.254
You have powers,
don't you?

09:29.321 --> 09:33.925
What exactly do you think
I'm capable of?

09:33.993 --> 09:36.595
A man needs
your help here.

09:36.663 --> 09:38.864
We each have our time.

09:38.932 --> 09:41.834
His is done.

09:41.902 --> 09:44.137
What are you saying?

09:44.204 --> 09:46.839
Help me.

09:46.907 --> 09:50.142
Please.
Your wounds are too great.

09:50.210 --> 09:51.978
We'll pray for your soul.

09:52.046 --> 09:54.247
Can I help?

09:56.183 --> 09:58.584
Yes.

10:10.498 --> 10:12.566
Easy.

10:30.151 --> 10:32.252
I'll dig a grave.

10:48.903 --> 10:51.704
- Guinevere.
- What're you doing here?

10:51.772 --> 10:53.338
You rode off on your own.

10:53.406 --> 10:55.407
My father's dying.

10:55.475 --> 10:56.942
I heard. I'm sorry.

10:57.009 --> 10:59.711
Stop.

11:02.147 --> 11:04.582
He's been living
with his sister, out east,

11:04.650 --> 11:08.019
since the wedding.
It's not safe!

11:08.086 --> 11:10.855
What would you do
if you were me?

11:12.791 --> 11:16.227
Thank you.
Where you heading?

11:16.295 --> 11:19.230
- Out east.
- Not through the forest.

11:19.298 --> 11:21.633
There was another attack
last night.

11:21.701 --> 11:23.868
That's no place
for your wife.

11:23.936 --> 11:28.740
- I'm not his wife.
- None of my business.

11:28.807 --> 11:31.876
- How long has it been like that?
- Oh, since always.

11:31.944 --> 11:34.311
We get people through here,
they're wounded,

11:34.379 --> 11:35.812
and they're scared.

11:35.880 --> 11:38.181
They're just trying
to make a living.

11:38.249 --> 11:40.217
People said
it would be...

11:40.284 --> 11:42.185
...it would be different
with the new king.

11:42.252 --> 11:45.521
But no.
He's done nothing for us.

11:45.589 --> 11:48.023
Maybe
he's doing his best.

11:48.091 --> 11:49.993
It's a big task.

11:50.060 --> 11:52.395
But he wanted it.

11:52.463 --> 11:54.865
You'd think
he'd be better at it.

12:00.839 --> 12:04.209
- I'll accompany you.
- You're in more danger than I am.

12:04.277 --> 12:06.712
The king
travelling alone?

12:06.779 --> 12:09.882
No banners, no seals.
Outside of Camelot,

12:09.950 --> 12:12.084
hardly anyone knows
what I look like, apparently.

12:12.152 --> 12:14.753
If you get hurt
because of me--

12:14.821 --> 12:16.255
We'll take the coast,

12:16.323 --> 12:18.590
not the forest.

12:18.658 --> 12:21.360
Leontes saved my life.

12:21.428 --> 12:23.996
The least I can do
is guard my champion's wife.

12:24.063 --> 12:26.231
I'll take you
to your father.

12:26.299 --> 12:29.034
For Leontes.

12:30.970 --> 12:33.539
- For both of you.
- No other reason?

12:33.606 --> 12:36.008
The past is done with.

12:38.978 --> 12:41.213
Thank you.

12:49.122 --> 12:51.691
Ya!

12:59.266 --> 13:01.200
...she's done
to my family!

13:01.268 --> 13:04.337
She's resting.

13:04.404 --> 13:06.872
Where are you going?
Where is she?

13:06.940 --> 13:10.209
The king's sister.
I need to see her immediately.

13:10.277 --> 13:13.446
She sees people in order.
And she has more than enough

13:13.513 --> 13:14.914
to see today.

13:14.982 --> 13:18.451
The gates will be
open again tomorrow.

13:18.519 --> 13:21.487
No.
She needs to see us.

13:21.555 --> 13:23.957
Now.

13:43.610 --> 13:46.045
You've hardly
said anything since we set off.

13:46.113 --> 13:48.714
Is it
what that woman said?

13:48.782 --> 13:52.084
How do I make it work?
We stake our territory to the North,

13:52.151 --> 13:54.486
people to the East are
vulnerable. I tackle the valleys

13:54.554 --> 13:56.621
in the East, we face incursion
from the South.

13:56.689 --> 13:59.024
Every time I fail,
or make an omission,

13:59.091 --> 14:02.994
or prioritize, I'm responsible
for a death somewhere else.

14:03.062 --> 14:06.131
Everyone looks
to me now.

14:06.199 --> 14:08.100
I saw how you handled
the hearing

14:08.168 --> 14:09.602
with Katelyn's father.

14:09.669 --> 14:12.038
You listened
and you questioned.

14:13.974 --> 14:16.376
Even the fact you convened it
in the first place.

14:16.444 --> 14:19.212
You understand the people,
and you care.

14:19.280 --> 14:21.015
Well done.

14:22.951 --> 14:27.054
Family disagreements,
territorial wrangling--

14:27.122 --> 14:29.256
you handled them all
superbly.

14:29.324 --> 14:31.391
And when
the time comes,

14:31.459 --> 14:34.894
all of them shall owe you
loyalty.

14:37.497 --> 14:40.566
But now you must apply yourself
to your new powers.

14:40.633 --> 14:42.601
You asked for them,

14:42.668 --> 14:46.004
and yet you shy away
from using them. Why?

14:46.071 --> 14:47.739
You know why.

14:47.806 --> 14:50.241
Because I can't bear
to be in her skin.

14:50.309 --> 14:52.010
Not good enough.

14:52.078 --> 14:54.012
You've been given a gift.

14:54.080 --> 14:55.448
Use it.

14:55.515 --> 14:57.416
I'm sorry to disturb you.
There's a woman

14:57.484 --> 15:00.086
in the hall insisting
on speaking to you immediately.

15:00.154 --> 15:02.622
Tell her to wait her turn
like everyone else.

15:02.690 --> 15:04.791
I did. It's just...

15:04.859 --> 15:07.794
...she says
you're in terrible danger.

15:43.132 --> 15:45.900
Are you thinking
about your father?

15:45.968 --> 15:49.336
Last night I dreamt of him
as if he was calling me.

15:51.239 --> 15:53.975
I never dreamt of him
before.

15:54.043 --> 15:55.776
We'll get to him.

15:58.981 --> 16:02.416
If you could have your old
life back, would you take it?

16:02.484 --> 16:05.219
If I said yes, it would mean
my parents would be alive.

16:05.287 --> 16:09.056
But I'd be back there and know
none of this, and the thing is,

16:09.124 --> 16:10.658
I love it.

16:12.594 --> 16:15.196
You say that
like you should be ashamed.

16:17.600 --> 16:20.368
I didn't realize it
until just now.

16:20.435 --> 16:23.070
Who has summoned me?

16:28.576 --> 16:30.511
We need to speak alone.

16:30.579 --> 16:33.213
I have nothing to hide
from my people.

16:33.281 --> 16:35.015
You may not,

16:35.083 --> 16:37.684
but the woman
at your side does.

16:37.752 --> 16:40.453
Do you know
each other?

16:40.521 --> 16:42.422
I can't tell.

16:42.490 --> 16:45.291
Take off your veil.
You don't order me.

16:45.359 --> 16:48.962
Have you told her?
Does she know?

16:49.030 --> 16:51.798
I don't know
what you mean.

16:51.865 --> 16:53.834
The king's sister harbours
a devil.

16:53.902 --> 16:55.736
What?

16:58.373 --> 17:02.310
Why do you keep your face
covered? May I see?

17:02.378 --> 17:05.381
Yes. Maybe then
you'll understand.

17:22.297 --> 17:24.698
How did it happen?

17:29.103 --> 17:31.371
My daughter was
in the building.

17:31.439 --> 17:34.876
She'd sent a message
for me to come.

17:34.943 --> 17:37.545
I got there
too late.

17:37.613 --> 17:40.415
I was inside
when it started.

17:40.483 --> 17:44.954
The flames spread
like the devil himself--

17:45.022 --> 17:48.891
across the doorways,
the floors.

17:48.959 --> 17:52.362
And then I heard her.

17:52.429 --> 17:54.564
Where was this?

17:54.631 --> 17:56.699
The nunnery
across the sea.

17:56.767 --> 17:59.268
I know
you were there once.

17:59.336 --> 18:02.171
Is that why
you allowed her here?

18:02.239 --> 18:05.941
I came to be at her side.
She needed me.

18:06.009 --> 18:07.876
Of course.

18:07.944 --> 18:11.446
You thought
no one would find you.

18:11.514 --> 18:14.816
But I've made it
my mission.

18:14.884 --> 18:18.187
You lit that fire.

18:18.254 --> 18:20.523
The nunnery burned

18:20.590 --> 18:22.558
because of you.
No.

18:22.626 --> 18:24.293
I pulled myself out,

18:24.361 --> 18:27.530
and I saw you,
hiding

18:27.598 --> 18:30.300
as my daughter died
screaming.

18:30.368 --> 18:33.003
It can't be!

18:33.071 --> 18:34.705
What do you want?

18:34.773 --> 18:37.875
- Retribution.
- To what end?

18:39.945 --> 18:41.880
For the daughter I lost.

18:41.948 --> 18:43.882
You must sit in judgment

18:43.950 --> 18:46.219
on the woman you've been
harbouring.

18:46.286 --> 18:48.521
She must be executed.

19:51.351 --> 19:52.752
How was your swim?

19:52.819 --> 19:54.887
Was the water cold?

19:54.955 --> 19:58.056
Freezing.
But I have to swim.

19:58.124 --> 20:00.025
Why?

20:01.928 --> 20:04.596
To forget myself.

20:04.664 --> 20:07.699
To lose the world
for a moment.

20:09.601 --> 20:11.569
The king's feast.

20:14.306 --> 20:16.374
Thank you.

20:20.345 --> 20:23.280
Why didn't you save him?

20:23.348 --> 20:27.217
I can't stop people dying or
bring them back from the dead

20:27.285 --> 20:30.120
any more than you can.
So you're not a sorcerer.

20:30.188 --> 20:32.022
The word's an insult.

20:33.958 --> 20:36.527
Did you study magic,
or were you born with it?

20:36.595 --> 20:40.599
- Neither.
- So where does it come from?

20:40.667 --> 20:43.536
Thought...
made manifest.

20:43.603 --> 20:45.538
That doesn't make
any sense.

20:45.606 --> 20:48.107
Would you be happier if I said
it was a gift from God?

20:48.175 --> 20:51.277
It would be clearer
to me.

20:51.345 --> 20:54.981
Listen, there are forces
in the fire, wind,

20:55.048 --> 20:57.984
water,

20:58.052 --> 21:00.353
the earth.

21:00.421 --> 21:04.457
I can shape these elements
to my will--

21:04.525 --> 21:07.994
in some...
small degree.

21:08.062 --> 21:11.264
- No, that's God working through you.
- Unlikely,

21:11.332 --> 21:13.800
given there is no God.

21:15.770 --> 21:18.773
Merlin, I followed you from
Uther's deathbed to Camelot.

21:18.841 --> 21:22.443
I'm the king's most loyal knight.
All that I ask is that you respect my faith.

21:22.511 --> 21:25.613
Like you respect mine?

21:27.516 --> 21:29.283
I don't understand it,

21:29.350 --> 21:32.352
but I don't disrespect it.

21:32.420 --> 21:35.456
You don't hear me call you
a devil for what you do.

21:35.523 --> 21:38.259
Then what would you call me?
Hmm?

21:40.195 --> 21:42.396
An angel perhaps?

21:51.508 --> 21:55.211
I've been called a lot
of things, but never that.

21:58.883 --> 22:02.853
Perfect. So you could summon a
storm to blow all this away?

22:02.921 --> 22:05.656
No. Too big.

22:05.724 --> 22:07.658
The cost would kill me.

22:07.726 --> 22:09.526
What sort of cost?

22:09.594 --> 22:13.530
On the body.
The soul.

22:13.598 --> 22:15.432
And those around me.

22:18.269 --> 22:20.736
It's an addiction.

22:20.804 --> 22:24.139
One which I deny myself
every waking hour.

22:26.075 --> 22:29.211
Not now.
Of all the times, not now!

22:29.279 --> 22:31.213
Is there anything
I can get you?

22:31.281 --> 22:34.884
And in front of all those people!
Think of what they'll say.

22:34.951 --> 22:37.520
Imagine how fast
this is spreading--

22:37.587 --> 22:40.589
that Morgan judges others,
but keeps a murderer close!

22:40.657 --> 22:42.024
There were only
a few people there--

22:42.092 --> 22:44.193
That makes no difference!
They'll gossip!

22:44.261 --> 22:45.894
They love to gossip.

22:45.962 --> 22:48.563
What we are doing must not be
undermined.

22:48.631 --> 22:50.765
It's too important.

22:50.833 --> 22:54.235
How could she do this to me?
How could she not tell me?

22:54.302 --> 22:56.103
What will you do?

23:02.276 --> 23:05.211
I don't have a choice.

23:05.279 --> 23:08.214
I must have
a public hearing.

23:08.282 --> 23:11.451
The facts must be heard.

23:11.519 --> 23:13.020
Do you think it's true?

23:13.087 --> 23:15.589
I don't need you
questioning me too, Vivian.

23:15.657 --> 23:18.192
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean anything by it.

23:18.260 --> 23:20.628
Why now?

23:20.696 --> 23:23.799
When people were starting
to believe in me.

23:23.866 --> 23:27.603
Sybil asked
if she could see you.

23:27.671 --> 23:32.174
So she can lie to me?
Talk me round? Ha!

23:32.242 --> 23:36.244
Tell her I'm indisposed.
Are you sure?

23:36.312 --> 23:39.847
I can arrange it
so no one would know or see.

23:42.150 --> 23:45.052
Tell her I'll see her tomorrow
at the hearing.

23:45.119 --> 23:48.054
And we shall uncover
the truth.

23:50.024 --> 23:53.160
If it's true,
what will you do?

23:53.228 --> 23:55.897
That will be all,
Vivian.

24:22.092 --> 24:24.794
<i>Help me!</i>
<i>Help me!</i>

24:26.763 --> 24:29.765
<i>Help, somebody!</i>

24:45.447 --> 24:49.551
What do you think they are,
up there?

24:49.619 --> 24:52.253
Maybe the eyes
of the gods keeping watch.

24:52.321 --> 24:54.756
Or the many eyes
of a single God.

24:54.824 --> 24:58.059
Spread across
every land,

24:58.127 --> 25:00.261
seeing everything.

25:03.499 --> 25:05.434
I don't know.

25:05.501 --> 25:09.038
I'm sorry for everything
that's happened.

25:10.941 --> 25:12.876
I'm sorry for it all.

25:12.943 --> 25:16.312
There's nothing
to apologize for.

25:19.483 --> 25:21.584
Thank you.

25:34.765 --> 25:38.000
- Take that.
- Arthur,

25:38.068 --> 25:41.603
- Mm?
- There's somebody here.

25:41.671 --> 25:43.772
And the other one.

25:53.948 --> 25:56.216
Come here, you!
Come here!

26:18.173 --> 26:20.508
- No, please!
- Put it down,

26:20.576 --> 26:23.445
or I put your face
in the fire.

26:25.348 --> 26:27.649
Are you all right?

26:56.244 --> 26:58.312
It's been
plundered.

27:00.015 --> 27:02.483
Your really think
they left the books?

27:02.551 --> 27:06.187
I'm hoping a barbarian's thugs didn't
realize the treasures that lay here.

27:06.255 --> 27:09.190
Are you ready?

27:09.258 --> 27:12.527
This feels
another life away.

27:12.594 --> 27:14.662
I'll go in first.

27:58.308 --> 28:00.710
I've been kidding myself
I could walk back in

28:00.778 --> 28:03.045
and my parents would
still be here.

28:03.113 --> 28:04.847
I know.

28:06.784 --> 28:09.786
The books are gone,
Merlin.

28:09.854 --> 28:11.722
No...

28:11.790 --> 28:15.126
They have to be here!

28:15.194 --> 28:17.795
They're not.

28:21.601 --> 28:24.036
It doesn't make
any sense.

28:24.104 --> 28:28.207
Maybe someone took them,
or used them as fuel for their fires.

28:32.078 --> 28:34.979
Come and be judged.

28:37.516 --> 28:39.984
You've heard
the accusation.

28:40.052 --> 28:42.253
What do you say
in response?

28:44.657 --> 28:46.224
First of all,

28:46.291 --> 28:48.392
I come
to ask forgiveness.

28:48.459 --> 28:52.396
Forgiveness?
You killed my daughter!

28:52.464 --> 28:54.131
Let her speak.

28:54.199 --> 28:57.768
Did you burn
the nunnery?

28:57.836 --> 29:00.804
Yes.

29:10.916 --> 29:12.983
Tell us what happened.

29:16.054 --> 29:19.256
There are forces
in this world

29:19.324 --> 29:20.891
which must be satisfied

29:20.959 --> 29:23.461
if they are
to be kept at bay.

29:25.898 --> 29:27.499
There was a ritual.

29:27.567 --> 29:31.570
Every year,
one girl was selected.

29:34.074 --> 29:38.311
Embracing God did not mean
we abandoned the old ways.

29:38.379 --> 29:40.347
What did you do
to my daughter?

29:40.414 --> 29:43.817
Nothing. I swear.

29:43.885 --> 29:47.188
- You offered girls to the devil in a nunnery!
- No.

29:47.256 --> 29:49.257
Not the devil.

29:51.626 --> 29:56.863
Only a few understood
the necessity of the ritual.

29:56.931 --> 29:58.765
Many did not.

29:58.833 --> 30:01.367
That night,
the priests came,

30:01.435 --> 30:03.903
looking for evidence
of the ceremony.

30:03.971 --> 30:05.704
So I burned it.

30:05.772 --> 30:08.474
But the fire spread.
I couldn't stop it.

30:08.542 --> 30:12.345
I only survived by jumping
from a window.

30:12.413 --> 30:15.281
Every night...

30:15.349 --> 30:18.718
...I hear her screams.

30:18.786 --> 30:21.554
And see her face.

30:21.622 --> 30:23.524
It haunts me

30:23.592 --> 30:25.659
like a demon.

30:29.565 --> 30:31.666
Is that everything
you wish to say?

30:31.734 --> 30:34.670
This changes nothing!

30:34.737 --> 30:38.040
An execution is
the only just decision.

30:40.611 --> 30:43.446
A woman's life is
at stake.

30:43.514 --> 30:46.984
I shall take time
to consider.

30:47.051 --> 30:50.187
When I'm ready,
you shall hear my decision.

30:50.254 --> 30:52.289
Now clear the hall.

31:10.773 --> 31:12.708
That's his shield.

31:12.776 --> 31:15.811
He's already dead,
isn't he?

31:15.879 --> 31:18.314
Whatever you find here,
you can face it.

31:18.382 --> 31:20.183
You came!

31:20.251 --> 31:22.853
He'll be so pleased.
Aunt Sara.

31:25.090 --> 31:27.024
He said you'd come.

31:27.092 --> 31:29.260
He was so sure.
How is he doing?

31:29.328 --> 31:30.728
In a lot of pain.

31:30.795 --> 31:34.097
He's holding on for you.
Go on through.

31:51.014 --> 31:52.915
You came.

31:52.983 --> 31:55.083
Yes.

31:55.151 --> 31:57.085
I missed you, Alice.

32:00.022 --> 32:01.956
No, Father.

32:02.024 --> 32:03.891
It's me.

32:03.959 --> 32:06.159
Guinevere.

32:09.029 --> 32:11.197
Is there anything else
we can do for him?

32:11.264 --> 32:13.165
Just be with him.

32:25.879 --> 32:29.514
When Zeus asked his daughter,
Artemis,

32:29.582 --> 32:33.051
what she wanted
for her third birthday,

32:33.119 --> 32:36.188
she requested
that he grant her 6 wishes.

32:38.158 --> 32:41.460
The first wish was
that she be allowed

32:41.528 --> 32:44.496
to live her life...

32:47.801 --> 32:50.902
...without the distraction
of love and marriage.

33:26.736 --> 33:29.137
Here's what
I don't understand--

33:29.205 --> 33:31.373
Oh,
this could take a while.

33:31.441 --> 33:33.075
Very funny.

33:33.142 --> 33:35.377
You bring Arthur
to Camelot.

33:35.444 --> 33:37.713
You recruit warriors
from...

33:37.780 --> 33:40.716
...throughout the realm.
You tell all of us

33:40.783 --> 33:43.719
to use our skills
to serve the new king.

33:43.787 --> 33:47.156
And yet you won't use yours
for the same end.

33:47.224 --> 33:49.158
It's different.

33:49.226 --> 33:51.995
Why? Because
you're better than us?

33:53.898 --> 33:57.668
Because I loathe this power
inside me.

33:59.604 --> 34:01.772
Because it terrifies me.

34:01.840 --> 34:03.775
Because you deny it.

34:03.842 --> 34:06.477
Because it controls you.

34:06.545 --> 34:09.080
Because it pulls me
to the dark.

34:09.147 --> 34:11.081
Then don't let it.

34:11.149 --> 34:14.551
You think this is any different
than any of us learning combat,

34:14.619 --> 34:17.887
learning to suppress rage
for greater skill?

34:17.955 --> 34:21.924
We all struggle, we all fight,
and we all learn to control.

34:21.992 --> 34:24.059
You have a raw power,
Merlin.

34:24.127 --> 34:27.594
But instead of denying it,
learn to love it.

34:27.663 --> 34:30.331
Imagine what you could be
capable of then.

34:32.268 --> 34:35.370
What you could bring
to Camelot.

34:52.789 --> 34:54.222
Why didn't you tell me?

34:54.290 --> 34:56.224
I was ashamed.

34:56.292 --> 34:59.761
You came here because
you thought you'd be safe.

34:59.829 --> 35:01.730
No.

35:01.797 --> 35:04.099
I came here to help you

35:04.166 --> 35:06.734
through your sickness.

35:06.802 --> 35:08.770
And look at you now.

35:08.838 --> 35:11.373
On the verge of the throne.

35:11.441 --> 35:14.843
Look at what you've got.
So much strength.

35:14.911 --> 35:17.246
You're so close.

35:17.314 --> 35:19.349
You mustn't let this...

35:21.318 --> 35:25.788
...this misunderstanding
push us off course.

35:33.631 --> 35:35.532
As the king's sister,

35:35.600 --> 35:38.936
I can't ignore
what I've been told.

35:40.838 --> 35:42.906
I understand.

35:47.545 --> 35:49.613
Don't abandon me.

35:52.050 --> 35:53.484
Morgan, please!

35:53.552 --> 35:56.187
Good night, Sybil.

36:15.611 --> 36:17.545
This was his cloak.

36:17.613 --> 36:20.682
He said I was to make sure
you had it.

36:22.652 --> 36:24.386
Thank you.

36:27.323 --> 36:29.858
Would you say something?

36:34.764 --> 36:36.698
Thank you all
for being here.

36:36.766 --> 36:39.868
I'm sure
it meant a lot to him.

36:39.936 --> 36:42.238
I'm so glad he came
to be with you here,

36:42.305 --> 36:47.176
and that you could be near him
at the end.

36:55.385 --> 36:58.287
We all have our own ideas
of what death might be.

36:58.355 --> 37:00.322
For all we know,

37:00.390 --> 37:04.561
Death could be the greatest
good that could happen to us.

37:07.498 --> 37:13.369
Cicero said, "The life of the dead is
placed in the memories of the living".

37:13.437 --> 37:17.107
The love we feel
in life

37:17.175 --> 37:20.110
keeps people alive
beyond their time.

37:20.178 --> 37:23.448
There isn't a day
my parents aren't with me.

37:23.515 --> 37:28.153
In my memories,
and in who I am.

37:28.221 --> 37:32.424
Anyone who has given love will
always live on

37:32.491 --> 37:34.559
in another's heart.

37:40.498 --> 37:43.433
All is change.

37:43.501 --> 37:47.102
All yields its place
and goes.

37:47.170 --> 37:50.840
To persevere,
trusting in what hopes he has,

37:50.907 --> 37:52.841
is courage in a man.

37:52.909 --> 37:55.678
Only the coward despairs.

37:59.249 --> 38:03.186
Come on.
Good night.

38:12.297 --> 38:13.831
Father.

39:44.658 --> 39:47.060
Are you ready?

39:49.563 --> 39:52.465
We could stay longer,
if you want.

39:52.533 --> 39:54.934
No.

39:55.002 --> 39:57.403
Let's go home.

40:39.043 --> 40:40.945
So many books.

40:41.012 --> 40:43.380
And they're all
different.

40:43.448 --> 40:47.118
All human experience is
here.

40:47.186 --> 40:50.789
- Why did he hide them?
- Because he knew their value.

40:52.691 --> 40:56.160
Because he thought
we'd come back for them.

41:07.672 --> 41:09.806
How did you know
where to look?

41:15.746 --> 41:19.515
Well, we got
what we came for.

41:19.583 --> 41:22.585
Shall we go?
Yes.

41:22.653 --> 41:24.553
Let's go home.

41:27.857 --> 41:29.958
- Ha!
- Ya!

41:52.085 --> 41:54.053
Are you all right?

41:55.956 --> 41:57.790
It's colder tonight.

42:00.227 --> 42:02.295
I'm an orphan now.

42:07.001 --> 42:08.935
Will you hold me?

42:10.838 --> 42:12.405
Nothing else.

42:12.473 --> 42:14.541
I just don't want
to feel alone.

42:24.318 --> 42:27.687
They're not the eyes
of the gods;

42:27.755 --> 42:31.190
they're the eyes
of those who've passed...

42:33.127 --> 42:36.295
...watching over us.

42:36.363 --> 42:38.865
I like that.

43:31.054 --> 43:35.491
Leontes!
What's the hurry?

43:42.364 --> 43:45.132
- What happened?
- A deer ran in front

43:45.200 --> 43:47.334
of my horse. It frightened
the life out of it--it threw me.

43:47.402 --> 43:50.671
The king's champion,
wounded by a deer.

43:50.738 --> 43:52.373
Your shoulder's come
out of the socket.

43:52.440 --> 43:53.874
- I'll do it.
- I'm fine. Don't touch me.

43:53.942 --> 43:55.943
Better think
of something else.

43:56.011 --> 43:57.978
Just try and pretend like
you're not going to enjoy this,

43:58.046 --> 43:59.847
all right?
Leave it!

43:59.914 --> 44:02.015
Leontes!

44:05.153 --> 44:07.321
Look.

44:17.599 --> 44:19.400
Now!

44:19.467 --> 44:21.935
Ahhhhh!!

44:22.003 --> 44:25.005
There we go.

44:41.455 --> 44:43.990
So you can control it.

44:48.128 --> 44:50.663
See?
You are an angel.

45:00.575 --> 45:02.977
I've considered
all that's been said.

45:03.044 --> 45:06.114
There has been
enormous suffering.

45:06.181 --> 45:09.884
There shall be
no favours.

45:09.952 --> 45:12.888
The punishment must be
both fitting

45:12.955 --> 45:15.223
and appropriate!

45:17.626 --> 45:21.663
Morgan, please!

45:21.730 --> 45:23.398
Quiet.

45:23.466 --> 45:25.933
You need
to accept this.

45:27.836 --> 45:29.971
Burn her!

45:32.507 --> 45:36.309
Burn her!
Yes! Vengeance!

45:44.552 --> 45:47.988
That is
your retribution.

45:48.055 --> 45:50.891
It is not enough.
She must be executed.

45:50.958 --> 45:53.393
- I've given my decision.
- My daughter died!

45:53.460 --> 45:56.795
- That was a mistake!
- What about the rituals? The other girls who died?

45:56.863 --> 45:59.464
- No girls died.
- She said they were chosen!

45:59.531 --> 46:04.201
You have no idea what it means to be chosen.
I will not be challenged!

46:07.705 --> 46:09.873
You want her
to feel your pain?

46:09.941 --> 46:12.376
She will now.
Every day.

46:12.443 --> 46:14.878
You want her life
for your daughter's?

46:14.946 --> 46:17.781
I don't accept that.

46:17.849 --> 46:21.786
She has her punishment.
You have your retribution.

46:23.723 --> 46:27.359
Now go,
or face my guards.

46:35.134 --> 46:38.837
Does anyone else wish
to dispute my decision?

46:45.143 --> 46:47.244
It is beautiful.

46:47.312 --> 46:49.212
We'll make it
more than that--

46:49.280 --> 46:52.548
make it a place to be
proud of, I promise.

46:52.616 --> 46:55.017
I believe you.

48:04.288 --> 48:06.556
Thank you.

48:19.071 --> 48:21.640
Well done.
It's exactly what we need.

48:21.708 --> 48:23.408
A place to think.

48:23.476 --> 48:26.112
The whole nation
will be that.

48:28.482 --> 48:31.751
What was it like?

48:31.818 --> 48:34.053
It was beautiful.

48:36.656 --> 48:39.258
Thank you for taking such great
care of my wife on the journey.

48:39.326 --> 48:41.761
If it had to be anyone,
I'm grateful it was you.

48:41.828 --> 48:45.631
It was my honour. I'm sorry it
wasn't for a happier occurrence.

48:48.101 --> 48:52.171
Right, well, we've still got a lot
of work to do. Gawain, Brastias,

48:52.238 --> 48:55.508
take 30 men out to the valley in the east.
Plant banners every mile.

48:55.576 --> 48:58.678
When you stop in the woods, let
everyone know what you're doing.

48:58.746 --> 49:00.747
Tell them to spread the word:
they are protected.

49:00.814 --> 49:03.650
- We've only just got back.
- The king gave an order, Brastias.

49:03.717 --> 49:05.651
Gather up the banners.

49:05.719 --> 49:07.519
We're moving east.

49:09.322 --> 49:11.023
Did I hear of plans

49:11.090 --> 49:13.192
to rebuild the roof?

49:13.259 --> 49:15.560
No,
I've changed my mind.

49:15.628 --> 49:17.696
That roof must
never be sealed.

49:17.764 --> 49:20.533
Never built over.
If we look up and see the sky,

49:20.600 --> 49:22.535
we'll never forget
who we're serving.

49:22.603 --> 49:24.537
never be disconnected
from the world outside.

49:24.605 --> 49:26.640
I like that.
