00:03.754 --> 00:06.040
It looked as though Yamucha

00:06.131 --> 00:10.500
had been victorious over one of the Saibaimen.

00:10.594 --> 00:12.175
However...

00:15.974 --> 00:20.263
Hey, get that filthy, tattered mess cleaned up.

00:20.354 --> 00:24.814
At length, Kuririn's anger explodes!

"Sit Tight, Chaozu!
Tenshinhan's Screaming Kikoho. "

02:07.920 --> 02:11.583
Let me show you the results of my training!

02:15.552 --> 02:17.213
Go!

02:23.268 --> 02:26.351
What's with the slow-motion blast?

02:50.212 --> 02:51.668
You got them!

02:51.755 --> 02:53.711
Wow, amazing!

02:53.799 --> 02:56.006
Kuririn, are you okay?

02:56.093 --> 02:59.927
Yeah... but I missed one of them.

03:07.938 --> 03:09.553
To hell with you!

03:22.786 --> 03:25.243
That's Piccolo for you.

03:25.330 --> 03:29.573
Just thinking that he might be our
enemy again gives me the chills.

03:29.668 --> 03:32.375
Thank you, Piccolo-san.

03:32.462 --> 03:35.750
Don't get the wrong idea.
As if I would rescue you.

03:35.841 --> 03:41.381
I was just warming up for the
wonderful fight that's about to begin.

03:44.516 --> 03:47.929
Let's hope that's how the fight turns out.

03:55.319 --> 04:01.110
Well then, as you wish, shall we
put an end to the fun and games?

04:02.659 --> 04:05.196
The real battle is about to begin.

04:06.580 --> 04:10.744
I-Impossible! They aren't fazed at all!

04:10.834 --> 04:14.042
|-| hit them at full power!

04:17.466 --> 04:20.003
That's what Saiyans are like?!

04:27.184 --> 04:31.894
Let me take them. I'll finish off
all five of them in an instant.

04:31.980 --> 04:35.598
Suit yourself. However...

04:35.692 --> 04:38.684
Do not kill the Namekian.

04:38.779 --> 04:43.398
We have to get information about
the Dragon Balls out of him afterward.

04:43.492 --> 04:47.155
Okay then, do your best
to make this entertaining.

04:47.245 --> 04:49.201
I'll start...

04:50.624 --> 04:52.580
...with you!

04:54.086 --> 04:55.872
Let me handle this!

05:08.767 --> 05:10.678
Piccolo-san!

05:12.646 --> 05:15.558
It looks like this is going to be sort of fun.

05:15.649 --> 05:17.856
W-What?

05:38.839 --> 05:42.081
T-The whole ground is shaking...

05:44.344 --> 05:46.881
l-lt's no use, Ten-san!

05:48.682 --> 05:51.594
My supernatural powers have no effect!

05:51.685 --> 05:53.892
T-This can't be!

05:56.481 --> 06:01.225
H-How can this be? I had no
idea it would be this bad!

06:07.784 --> 06:10.947
Hurry! Hold on, guys!

06:33.935 --> 06:35.596
All right...!

06:39.608 --> 06:41.690
Chaozu, watch yourself!

07:06.802 --> 07:08.758
Tenshinhan!

07:15.811 --> 07:17.426
Ten-san!

07:25.445 --> 07:27.106
What fragile folks these are.

07:27.197 --> 07:29.688
Now to finish you!

07:33.495 --> 07:35.326
Damn you!

07:42.796 --> 07:45.458
Tenshinhan-san!

07:51.805 --> 07:54.262
Damn it! Tenshinhan!

07:54.349 --> 07:56.681
Wait! He's had it! Let him be!

07:56.768 --> 07:58.474
Shut up!

08:00.105 --> 08:02.312
Stay out of this!

08:28.466 --> 08:30.172
I can't see the bottom of the hole...

08:30.260 --> 08:34.253
Unbelievable! What a
tremendous energy wave!

08:34.347 --> 08:37.054
D-Damn...

08:37.142 --> 08:40.304
Nappa, look behind you!

08:44.149 --> 08:46.231
--Chaozu!
--Why, you...!

08:46.318 --> 08:48.274
You little punk!

08:58.079 --> 09:00.866
Chaozu! Get away from him!

09:03.877 --> 09:07.461
Chaozu, that's enough! Get away from him!

09:07.547 --> 09:09.959
T-Ten-san...

09:12.052 --> 09:14.418
Thank you...

09:14.512 --> 09:19.552
W-What are you talking about, Chaozu?!

09:19.643 --> 09:22.806
Get out of there! Hurry and get out of there!

09:26.900 --> 09:32.395
I enjoyed being together with you.

09:35.367 --> 09:40.452
Chaozu! What are you thinking of doing?!

09:46.628 --> 09:52.669
Farewell, Ten-san. Please don't die.

09:52.759 --> 09:56.468
Stop! Chaozu!!

10:14.406 --> 10:17.148
Ten-san!

10:24.332 --> 10:27.699
Chaozu!!

10:31.631 --> 10:33.587
He blew himself up, taking them both out.

10:33.675 --> 10:35.916
A pretty drastic thing to do.

10:36.011 --> 10:38.844
Nice work, for the little guy.

10:56.031 --> 10:59.194
That was a worthless thing to do.

10:59.284 --> 11:05.075
N-No way! How can he still
be fine?! That's terrible!

11:05.165 --> 11:09.033
Chaozu even gave up his own life!

11:10.628 --> 11:15.748
Chaozu... h-has already been brought
back to life once with the Dragon Balls!

11:15.842 --> 11:21.212
He can't ever be brought
back to life again! Damn it!

11:21.306 --> 11:23.672
I swear you'll pay for this!

11:26.728 --> 11:31.722
It looks like you still don't
realize how terrifying we are.

11:31.816 --> 11:35.855
All that remains for you is death!

11:57.467 --> 12:00.755
l-lt had no effect at all!

12:00.845 --> 12:04.383
Chaozu won't be able to rest in peace!

12:10.397 --> 12:12.058
Chaozu...

12:13.149 --> 12:16.983
Be grateful. I'll send you to see
him in the next world, right away!

12:21.032 --> 12:23.865
Y-You'll pay for this!

12:23.952 --> 12:26.910
I swear you'll pay for this!

12:53.189 --> 12:57.228
A-At this rate, Tenshinhan-san
will be done in as well!

12:57.318 --> 12:59.525
l have to do something!

12:59.612 --> 13:01.898
Stop!

13:01.990 --> 13:05.733
We'll have a brief opening during
the instant when he moves to attack.

13:05.827 --> 13:08.409
Wait for that moment.

13:08.496 --> 13:10.361
Got that, Gohan?

13:11.875 --> 13:13.206
Yes...

13:13.293 --> 13:15.375
That's a good strategy.

13:15.462 --> 13:18.204
Best of luck with that.

13:18.298 --> 13:21.210
Are you sure you should be looking away?

13:21.301 --> 13:23.132
You'll miss your chance.

13:23.219 --> 13:25.210
Heh, you sure are sure of yourself.

13:25.305 --> 13:30.265
But you'll stop making that stupid
face once Son Goku gets here.

13:30.351 --> 13:35.937
Ho? Who's that? Your ace-in-the-hole?

13:37.233 --> 13:39.189
Just you wait and see.

13:47.494 --> 13:50.702
Looks like that's all for you, huh?

13:50.788 --> 13:53.871
I'll come put you out of your misery, right now.

14:03.718 --> 14:05.800
See you in hell!

14:08.306 --> 14:10.467
Now! Scatter, Kuririn and Gohan!

14:10.558 --> 14:12.014
Yeah!

14:14.395 --> 14:17.432
I'm gonna finish you! Die!

14:20.485 --> 14:21.941
What?!

14:25.573 --> 14:28.064
Gohan! Now! Shoot him!

14:32.121 --> 14:33.531
Gohan!

14:33.623 --> 14:35.659
Get yourself ready!

14:37.085 --> 14:39.747
|-|'m too scared!

14:50.807 --> 14:52.217
You filthy brat!

14:52.308 --> 14:54.048
It's not working!

15:05.113 --> 15:08.355
We missed him! Our timing was too late!

15:09.534 --> 15:15.575
Now you've done it! You've just
shortened your own lives even more!

15:15.665 --> 15:20.534
Fine. I've decided to change
the order that I kill you in!

15:20.628 --> 15:23.040
Say your prayers!

15:23.131 --> 15:27.966
l-l'm sorry... Uncle Piccolo...

15:29.262 --> 15:32.095
What is wrong, Kami-sama?

15:32.181 --> 15:36.299
Hmm, it would seem my life
will only last a little longer.

15:36.394 --> 15:40.478
Death... death is closing in on me.

15:40.565 --> 15:44.308
You cannot mean...

15:44.402 --> 15:46.643
Piccolo is going to be killed.

15:46.738 --> 15:49.445
And so is everyone else.

15:49.532 --> 15:51.397
W-What about Goku?

15:51.492 --> 15:55.735
Hmm... I still don't sense his presence.

15:55.830 --> 15:57.821
Goku, hurry!

15:59.292 --> 16:01.829
Ch-Chaozu...!

16:05.298 --> 16:08.916
We've always fought together...

16:09.010 --> 16:11.547
...and now, you can't be brought back to life!

16:16.059 --> 16:19.267
Ten-san... I'm sorry...

16:23.983 --> 16:25.848
Chaozu...!

16:28.571 --> 16:31.688
You were fools to upset me.

16:33.368 --> 16:37.202
Now, which one of you will I toy with first?

16:37.288 --> 16:42.624
I'll leave the Namekian just barely alive.

16:42.710 --> 16:46.703
Have to get more about the
Dragon Balls out of you, after all.

16:51.678 --> 16:53.589
and then I will be coming!

16:53.680 --> 16:57.389
I won't leave you there feeling lonely!

16:57.475 --> 17:02.060
This is... this is my... last...

17:04.607 --> 17:10.193
K-Kikoho!!

17:23.751 --> 17:26.208
Oh, did he get him?!

17:45.773 --> 17:47.764
Don't startle me like that!

17:47.859 --> 17:50.851
l-lt had no effect on him!

17:50.945 --> 17:53.231
That monster! Is he immortal?!

17:56.200 --> 17:59.283
C-Confound it...

18:10.798 --> 18:12.038
Fool!

18:12.133 --> 18:14.340
He could have just stayed down,

18:14.427 --> 18:17.009
but he used up all his power,
and died for nothing.

18:17.096 --> 18:21.055
O-Oh, no... not Tenshinhan, too...

18:21.142 --> 18:23.007
This is horrible... It's a nightmare...

18:23.102 --> 18:26.139
Everyone is dying, one after another...

18:27.982 --> 18:32.100
Gokull Get here, quickâ€œ

18:32.195 --> 18:34.607
Gokull

18:34.697 --> 18:35.812
Hurry!

18:35.907 --> 18:37.863
H urry! !

18:39.285 --> 18:42.072
Goku?

18:42.163 --> 18:45.155
Why do you keep saying--

18:45.249 --> 18:46.989
Hold on...

18:48.753 --> 18:53.543
I put another one of you away.
Now, it's your turn!

18:53.633 --> 18:55.794
Let's get back on the ground and fight.

18:55.885 --> 18:59.798
He's far better at fighting
in mid-air than we are.

19:02.058 --> 19:04.219
It'll be the same, either way.

19:04.310 --> 19:06.551
Flounder about, flounder about!

19:08.815 --> 19:10.521
Here goes!

19:10.608 --> 19:13.975
--Here he comes!
--Father!

19:14.070 --> 19:16.686
Nappa! Wait!

19:19.826 --> 19:22.408
W-What?! Why won't you let me at them?!

19:22.495 --> 19:26.454
Don't be hasty. There's a little
something I want to ask them.

19:26.541 --> 19:30.204
This "Son Goku" you keep
talking about is Kakarrot, right?

19:30.294 --> 19:33.127
That's right! So what if he is?!

19:35.842 --> 19:39.175
To think that your last
resort would be Kakarrot!

19:39.262 --> 19:41.594
What good will he do once he gets here,

19:41.681 --> 19:44.263
when he didn't stand a
chance against even Raditz?

19:44.350 --> 19:49.060
He's not like he was before!
He's gotten much, much stronger!

19:49.146 --> 19:52.434
Don't you go making light of Son Goku!

19:54.902 --> 19:57.860
For all of that, he doesn't
seem to be coming, does he?

19:57.947 --> 20:00.654
Are you sure he hasn't
gotten scared, and run away?

20:00.741 --> 20:04.734
H-He'll be here! My father
will be here for sure!

20:04.829 --> 20:07.411
And he's going to beat you guys up!

20:07.498 --> 20:10.114
That's some faith you have in him.

20:10.209 --> 20:13.576
This should be interesting.
We'll wait until he gets here.

20:13.671 --> 20:17.459
You're kidding, right?! Let's put
these guys away, right now!

20:17.550 --> 20:20.007
However, we'll only give him three hours.

20:20.094 --> 20:22.710
We won't wait any longer than that.

20:22.805 --> 20:25.842
This is ridiculous! I'm going to play now!

20:27.018 --> 20:30.260
Nappa! Didn't you hear what I said?!

20:31.939 --> 20:36.148
S-Sorry. I got a little carried away there...

20:36.235 --> 20:38.021
That's the deal. You should be grateful.

20:38.112 --> 20:40.945
You'll get to live a little while longer.

20:50.875 --> 20:54.914
You can't blame him. This is
his first real fight, after all.

20:55.004 --> 20:58.417
Hmph! What a sap I am for
expecting anything out of you.

20:58.507 --> 21:00.668
Get lost, you pantywaist.

21:03.262 --> 21:07.050
I have to say, though, the way that
big guy was cowering just now...

21:07.141 --> 21:08.972
Does that mean the runt there, Vegeta,

21:09.060 --> 21:12.848
is even more ridiculously strong?

21:12.939 --> 21:16.773
l'm aching to do something!
I can't wait any longer!

21:16.859 --> 21:20.067
Now, hold on. Three more hours.

21:20.154 --> 21:23.942
In three hours, we'll be witness
to a hellish horror show.

21:24.033 --> 21:27.241
Three hours until the battle resumes.

21:27.328 --> 21:30.411
Will Goku make it in time?
