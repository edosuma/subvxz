it's a triple‐word score.

00:03.336 --> 00:06.973
I get double letters here,
and here for a grand total

00:07.040 --> 00:09.743
of 21 points. Booyah.

00:09.810 --> 00:13.079
I don't think we can
accept E‐I‐E‐I‐O.

00:14.981 --> 00:17.684
Come on now, we let you get
away with "Peanutiness."

00:19.052 --> 00:22.689
The way I see it,
you E‐I‐E‐I owe me 21 points.

[imitates gasp]

00:24.525 --> 00:25.692
Oh, my God.

00:25.759 --> 00:29.462
There was big drama
at choir rehearsal today.

00:29.530 --> 00:31.331
The reverend's wife
and the choir director

00:31.397 --> 00:33.233
almost came to blows.

00:33.299 --> 00:36.570
You see, Ms. Taylor wanted the
play "Refrain Adagio," right?

00:36.637 --> 00:39.439
But Clarence insisted
that we played "Allegro."

00:39.506 --> 00:41.508
Then he accused her
of havin' no taste

00:41.575 --> 00:44.077
put on his fake zebra skin
jacket with the matching hat..

00:45.445 --> 00:46.713
...and stormed out.

00:46.780 --> 00:48.849
And the timing
could not be worse.

00:48.915 --> 00:52.085
I mean, the church's 50th
anniversary is only a week away.

00:52.152 --> 00:53.754
B‐b‐but the choir
has to perform!

00:53.820 --> 00:55.155
This is a big event.

00:55.221 --> 00:57.924
And I have the honor
of directing our church members

00:57.991 --> 01:00.466
and their guests
to their parking spaces.

our choir director

02:01.167 --> 02:02.703
has given me an ultimatum

that either Mrs. Taylor
goes or he goes. Heh‐heh.

Kyle directed

02:17.684 --> 02:19.452
the college choir.

02:19.519 --> 02:21.588
Oh, come on, Overton. Don't brag
in front of the reverend.

02:21.655 --> 02:24.925
You know, a state championship

I'm, I'm really flattered

02:40.373 --> 02:42.042

at work that‐‐

02:42.108 --> 02:45.178

I go there

03:57.123 --> 03:59.459
there's never enough seats.

03:59.526 --> 04:01.735
That's why they added
the 200‐seat annex

You know, Kyle

04:44.377 --> 04:46.847

we finally have a choir director

04:46.913 --> 04:49.182
who's not gonna play
favorites.

04:49.249 --> 04:53.720
So, now you can give the solo
to your favorite, moi.

it will give you center stage.

You know, there's,
there's nothing more fulfilling

05:08.374 --> 05:12.012
for a singer than
to raise her lone voice to God

05:12.078 --> 05:15.616
to let him hear
her joyful noise.

Okay, fine, Regine,
