WEBVTT

00:00.825 --> 00:01.959
- Previously on <i>Awkward:</i>

00:02.961 --> 00:04.227
- On our right,
we have the English Department.

00:04.229 --> 00:05.128
- Do you want to
get out of here?

00:05.130 --> 00:06.796
- We've been texting
each other every day.

00:06.798 --> 00:07.964
She's really cool.

00:07.966 --> 00:09.365
- It's just a little
catfishing.

00:09.367 --> 00:10.633
It's totally no big deal.

00:10.635 --> 00:12.201
- I'm sorry to bother you,
but I know you've been

00:12.203 --> 00:13.736
avoiding me,
and I'm just wondering why.

00:13.738 --> 00:15.204
- I'm adopted!

00:17.941 --> 00:20.643
- In the three weeks since
my college overnight,

00:20.645 --> 00:22.879
my one-night stand
had blossomed into

00:22.881 --> 00:24.981
three weekends of awesome.

00:24.983 --> 00:26.149
Luke was perfect.

00:26.151 --> 00:27.116
He was an adult.

00:27.118 --> 00:29.919
I liked the person I became
when we were together.

00:29.921 --> 00:33.456
I was Jenna 2.0, a better,
more evolved version

00:33.458 --> 00:34.657
of the girl I'd been...

00:34.659 --> 00:37.660
[mooing cow ringtone]

00:37.662 --> 00:38.261
Almost.

00:38.263 --> 00:39.996
- Hey, a couple of my friends
are planning a road trip

00:39.998 --> 00:41.864
to see Arctic Monkeys
in November.

00:41.866 --> 00:42.865
You want in?

00:42.867 --> 00:46.636
[cow mooing]

00:46.638 --> 00:47.737
Right.
Parents.

00:47.739 --> 00:49.906
I keep forgetting
you don't actually go here.

00:49.908 --> 00:52.542
I'm guessing Arctic Monkeys
are a no go.

00:52.544 --> 00:53.309
- What? Why?

00:53.311 --> 00:54.277
I love the Arctic Monkeys.

00:54.279 --> 00:56.913
- Your parents would seriously
let you drive to Arizona

00:56.915 --> 00:58.614
with four college guys
in a van?

00:58.616 --> 01:00.083
- My parents are
super laid back.

01:00.085 --> 01:02.185
They don't even like me
to call them Mom and Dad.

01:02.187 --> 01:04.887
They treat me more like
a best friend than a child.

01:04.889 --> 01:07.757
- Well, I'll count you in.

01:09.727 --> 01:13.129
[phone ringing]

01:14.331 --> 01:15.832
Hello.

01:15.834 --> 01:18.134
Who is this?

01:18.136 --> 01:20.336
Oh. Hi.

01:20.338 --> 01:23.239
Yeah, sure.

01:23.241 --> 01:26.342
- Jenna, it's Dad.

01:26.344 --> 01:27.477
- Hey, Kev.

01:27.479 --> 01:28.644
How'd you get Luke's number?

01:28.646 --> 01:30.012
- I called the dorm
and threatened to have him

01:30.014 --> 01:32.615
arrested for kidnapping
if they didn't hand it over.

01:32.617 --> 01:33.549
- What?
Are you insane?

01:33.551 --> 01:36.119
- No, I'm a parent,
and you're a child,

01:36.121 --> 01:38.654
one who is 45 minutes
past her curfew.

01:38.656 --> 01:40.156
Get home now.

01:40.158 --> 01:44.060
Oh, and Jenna, one more thing:
Plan on a long night.

01:44.062 --> 01:46.896
Your room's a real pigsty.

01:46.898 --> 01:48.264
[typing]

01:48.266 --> 01:50.433
Boom!

01:50.435 --> 01:53.770
[cheering]

01:54.671 --> 01:56.939
- Dating a college guy
made it harder

01:56.941 --> 01:58.274
to get into high school stuff,

01:58.276 --> 02:00.476
some of which I hated
in the first place,

02:00.478 --> 02:02.612
like being cheer bitch,
but sadly,

02:02.614 --> 02:03.946
while my heart
was in college,

02:03.948 --> 02:05.915
my head was stuck
in high school,

02:05.917 --> 02:08.317
and my face was
target practice.

02:08.319 --> 02:09.585
[cheering]

02:09.587 --> 02:10.553
- Come on, Matty!

02:10.555 --> 02:14.056
No guts, no glory, son!

02:14.058 --> 02:15.291
Let's go!

02:15.293 --> 02:17.593
- Dude, the Maryland scouts
watching you like a hawk.

02:17.595 --> 02:18.895
That last goal was insane, man.

02:18.897 --> 02:21.130
- No pressure, no diamonds.
- Okay!

02:21.132 --> 02:23.699
- Our son set the record
for most shots on goal

02:23.701 --> 02:24.700
his sophomore year.

02:24.702 --> 02:25.668
- Yep, you told me that.

02:25.670 --> 02:27.637
We've only got five
spots on our fall roster,

02:27.639 --> 02:29.272
but he's definitely
a strong candidate.

02:29.274 --> 02:31.207
- All right,
he's a McKibben!

02:31.209 --> 02:33.142
- So are they back
together or what?

02:33.144 --> 02:34.977
- No, they hate each other,
but they have to put on

02:34.979 --> 02:37.780
a united front because
they're McKibbens.

02:37.782 --> 02:38.948
- All right, Matty!

02:38.950 --> 02:39.982
Make us proud!

02:39.984 --> 02:41.217
[whistle blows]

02:41.219 --> 02:45.021
[cheering]

02:45.023 --> 02:46.789
- Come on, Matty!

02:46.791 --> 02:48.791
Come on!

02:48.793 --> 02:50.326
Go, go, go!

02:50.328 --> 02:52.195
- Aw!

02:52.197 --> 02:54.497
- Damn it!

02:57.835 --> 02:58.768
- Go, go, go!

02:58.770 --> 03:00.503
Get in there
and do your job!

03:00.505 --> 03:02.038
The Mr. P.H.H.S. pageant
is in five days,

03:02.040 --> 03:03.573
and you still haven't
printed the program,

03:03.575 --> 03:04.974
finalized the sets,
or talked lighting

03:04.976 --> 03:06.075
with Theo and Cole.

03:06.077 --> 03:08.377
I need rage management to cope
with your stage management.

03:08.379 --> 03:11.747
- T, it's a fake male
beauty pageant, not Broadway.

03:11.749 --> 03:12.682
Relax.
I'm on it.

03:12.684 --> 03:14.951
- The only thing
you're on is Cloud 69.

03:14.953 --> 03:18.154
Need I remind you
that this is a major application

03:18.156 --> 03:19.322
augmentation for you?

03:19.324 --> 03:19.989
[bell rings]

03:19.991 --> 03:21.924
- What was that?
- What was what?

03:21.926 --> 03:22.859
I should go change.

03:22.861 --> 03:25.728
You know how sweats
make me sweat.

03:25.730 --> 03:28.097
- You said you were done
catfishing.

03:28.099 --> 03:29.232
- I am!

03:29.234 --> 03:30.066
Almost.

03:30.068 --> 03:31.267
It's just...

03:31.269 --> 03:32.435
Jake Booty-texted me.

03:32.437 --> 03:34.203
Tamara-me, not Autumn-me.

03:34.205 --> 03:36.205
Well, technically,
he Booty-texted both of us,

03:36.207 --> 03:38.474
but the point is,
Jakara is back on track

03:38.476 --> 03:40.109
to being the P.H.H.S.P.C. again.

03:40.111 --> 03:41.677
The P.H.H.S. power couple.

03:41.679 --> 03:42.478
- Pause.
Rewind.

03:42.480 --> 03:44.714
Are you saying you want to
get back together with Jake?

03:44.716 --> 03:45.882
- No!

03:45.884 --> 03:46.916
Yes?
Maybe.

03:46.918 --> 03:49.952
- So ditch the online persona
and tell him the truth.

03:49.954 --> 03:50.887
- I will.

03:50.889 --> 03:53.489
As soon as Autumn convinces
Jake that Tamara has his heart

03:53.491 --> 03:56.659
this catfish is fried.

03:56.661 --> 03:57.727
- That was a tough game.

03:57.729 --> 04:00.630
- I can't believe the scout
bailed before halftime, man.

04:00.632 --> 04:02.198
What are you so happy about?

04:02.200 --> 04:03.099
- Autumn.

04:03.101 --> 04:05.334
Things are getting intense.
I'm really into her.

04:05.336 --> 04:06.435
- You've never even met her!

04:06.437 --> 04:08.838
She's probably a 45-year-old
sex offender named Ralph.

04:08.840 --> 04:11.140
- No way.
You can't fake that body.

04:11.142 --> 04:15.311
If she wants you to wire money
to her Nigerian Uncle, bail.

04:15.313 --> 04:18.581
- Mommy, did you see
my basket catch?

04:18.583 --> 04:19.782
- Humility, Lissa.

04:19.784 --> 04:21.150
Oh, look at the time!

04:21.152 --> 04:23.753
Tyler and I have a million
things to do:

04:23.755 --> 04:24.420
Bible study,

04:24.422 --> 04:26.322
shopping for Mr. P.H.H.S.
clothes--

04:26.324 --> 04:28.557
so Sadie can take you home,
right?

04:28.559 --> 04:31.594
- I don't have a car,
and my guardian is a skankaholic

04:31.596 --> 04:33.429
with a prescription
pill problem.

04:33.431 --> 04:34.797
- Okay, great.
Thanks, hon.

04:34.799 --> 04:36.766
- Bye, sis.
Thanks for the cheer.

04:36.768 --> 04:38.901
- Bye, babies.

04:38.903 --> 04:39.835
- Get over it, Lissa.

04:39.837 --> 04:41.971
The basket catch
wasn't that good.

04:41.973 --> 04:43.039
- It's not that.

04:43.041 --> 04:46.375
Ever since we adopted Tyler,
he's all my mom cares about.

04:46.377 --> 04:48.844
Now everything's all about
Mr. P.H.H.S.

04:48.846 --> 04:50.146
Just because Tyler's in it.

04:50.148 --> 04:53.282
Maybe I should compete
so she remembers I'm alive.

04:53.284 --> 04:55.551
- Are you too busy
with cheer captain

04:55.553 --> 04:57.720
to study your S.A.T. words,
Lissa?

04:57.722 --> 05:01.590
"Mister" means people
with penises.

05:01.592 --> 05:04.961
- But I'm the one
with pageant experience.

05:04.963 --> 05:06.429
[gasps]
I could coach Tyler!

05:06.431 --> 05:09.332
- Mr. P.H.H.S. isn't
a real beauty pageant.

05:09.334 --> 05:10.399
It's a popularity contest.

05:10.401 --> 05:14.270
Brian Woods won last year
for shotgunning a soda.

05:14.272 --> 05:16.605
I could take any loser
in this school,

05:16.607 --> 05:18.207
and beat you and Mufasa.

05:18.209 --> 05:21.610
- I told you, we call him Tyler,
and you could not!

05:21.612 --> 05:25.014
Winning any pageant takes
way more than popularity.

05:25.016 --> 05:25.781
- Want to bet?

05:25.783 --> 05:28.250
Loser gives up 40 bucks,
plus their honor,

05:28.252 --> 05:29.618
dignity, and self-esteem.

05:29.620 --> 05:30.920
Go ahead.

05:30.922 --> 05:34.390
Pick any guy.

05:38.061 --> 05:40.763
- Him!

05:44.067 --> 05:45.301
- Oh!
- Go ahead.

05:45.303 --> 05:46.535
- After you.

05:46.537 --> 05:49.772
Uh, have you picked a talent
for Mr. P.H.H.S. yet?

05:49.774 --> 05:51.841
- Well,
we know it's not soccer.

05:51.843 --> 05:54.076
- Yeah, your parents seemed
pretty intense.

05:54.078 --> 05:55.811
- Yeah,
that's one word for it.

05:55.813 --> 05:58.681
So I hear you're into
older guys now.

05:58.683 --> 05:59.482
- What?
No!

05:59.484 --> 06:01.250
- It's cool,
if you're happy.

06:01.252 --> 06:02.351
We're gonna be
in college soon.

06:02.353 --> 06:05.287
You might as well
get a jump on it.

06:06.523 --> 06:08.057
[beeping]

06:08.059 --> 06:09.892
[line ringing]

06:09.894 --> 06:10.526
- Hey.

06:10.528 --> 06:12.294
- Hey.
Why is campus so far?

06:12.296 --> 06:14.263
I'm having severe
separation anxiety.

06:14.265 --> 06:17.767
- Me, too, and I'm living
off five-dollar foot-longs.

06:17.769 --> 06:19.135
It saves me a ton of cash,

06:19.137 --> 06:20.536
which is going right into
the gas fund,

06:20.538 --> 06:21.537
so I can
come see you.

06:21.539 --> 06:23.472
Speaking of which, Saturday
is going to be awesome.

06:23.474 --> 06:26.342
Snuggle down with some cocoa
and watch <i>Evil Dead.</i>

06:26.344 --> 06:27.109
- I can't.

06:27.111 --> 06:28.277
I'm stuck in P.V. this weekend,

06:28.279 --> 06:29.378
stage managing a play.

06:29.380 --> 06:30.746
- Well, I'll come down,
see you in action.

06:30.748 --> 06:32.848
- Thus far, all of the action
between us

06:32.850 --> 06:35.351
had taken place in the privacy
of Luke's dorm room.

06:35.353 --> 06:39.188
Our relationship existed
in totally separate worlds,

06:39.190 --> 06:40.256
and I liked it that way.

06:40.258 --> 06:43.392
- It's just some stupid
high school thing.

06:43.394 --> 06:44.460
So not worth the drive.

06:44.462 --> 06:46.128
- Well, then I guess
we'll have to come up with ways

06:46.130 --> 06:49.331
to make the distance
less painful.

06:49.333 --> 06:50.499
- Sweetie?

06:50.501 --> 06:51.100
- Wow!

06:51.102 --> 06:52.902
I had no idea it took
12 years to paint

06:52.904 --> 06:54.570
the <i>Mona Lisa's</i> smile.

06:54.572 --> 06:55.204
Neat!

06:55.206 --> 06:57.373
- Is that Luke?
Hi, Luke!

06:57.375 --> 06:58.507
- Bye!
He has to study.

06:58.509 --> 06:59.809
- We would love
to see you again.

06:59.811 --> 07:01.644
Are you coming to
Jenna's pageant?

07:01.646 --> 07:02.978
- Mom!
- Pageant?

07:02.980 --> 07:03.979
- Mr. P.H.H.S.

07:03.981 --> 07:07.683
It's this goofy little pageant
for the senior boys.

07:07.685 --> 07:10.252
Jenna's dad was Mr. P.H.H.S.

07:10.254 --> 07:10.886
- Ah, I see.

07:10.888 --> 07:13.289
- It's lame.
- I'd love to come.

07:13.291 --> 07:13.889
- Great!

07:13.891 --> 07:15.324
Come by, and we'll
all go together.

07:15.326 --> 07:16.559
- No, no, no,
you don't have to.

07:16.561 --> 07:18.360
It's--really--
- sounds awesome.

07:18.362 --> 07:18.994
- Yay!

07:18.996 --> 07:20.362
We'll see you on
Saturday, Luke.

07:20.364 --> 07:21.964
- My relationship with Luke
may have existed

07:21.966 --> 07:24.333
in a separate world,
but apparently

07:24.335 --> 07:26.602
the planets
were about to collide.

07:29.172 --> 07:32.308
- San Diego is so far away
from Australia.

07:32.310 --> 07:34.310
I get so lonely.

07:34.312 --> 07:34.944
- Aw...

07:34.946 --> 07:38.047
Well, San Diego is close
to Palos Verdes.

07:38.049 --> 07:41.817
So close it's--close.

07:41.819 --> 07:42.718
You know,

07:42.720 --> 07:45.387
I feel like I can tell you
anything, Autumn.

07:45.389 --> 07:46.355
- Oh, me, too.

07:46.357 --> 07:49.325
Oy, that's my oldies
calling from the outback.

07:49.327 --> 07:50.359
Bye, schmoops!

07:50.361 --> 07:52.294
- Bye, boops.

17:58.334 --> 17:59.801
- Ladies and gentlemen,

17:59.803 --> 18:02.370
we are down to just
three finalists,

18:02.372 --> 18:07.175
one of whom will claim
the coveted Mr. P.H.H.S. crown:

18:07.177 --> 18:10.979
Kyle Cohen, Tyler Miller,

18:10.981 --> 18:12.881
and Jake Rosati!

18:12.883 --> 18:14.149
[cheers and applause]

18:14.151 --> 18:16.485
- Jake Rosati?

18:16.487 --> 18:19.321
Last call for Jake--

18:19.323 --> 18:22.591
okay, in the meantime,
one final question:

18:22.593 --> 18:25.694
Tyler, what is your most
cherished dream?

18:25.696 --> 18:28.864
- My dream is to be able to use
my recent blessings

18:28.866 --> 18:31.299
to get an education
to enable me

18:31.301 --> 18:34.970
to devote my life to ending
misery and suffering everywhere.

18:34.972 --> 18:35.604
- Ugh!

18:35.606 --> 18:37.873
Could he be any more cliche?

18:37.875 --> 18:39.741
- Well,
I believe he's sincere.

18:39.743 --> 18:41.977
- Whatever.
Get over it!

18:41.979 --> 18:45.313
- Kyle, for the crown.

18:45.315 --> 18:47.883
- Last night I had a dream
I was eating Sushi,

18:47.885 --> 18:50.819
and when I asked what
kind of fish was in it,

18:50.821 --> 18:54.055
the waiter said it was
human flesh,

18:54.057 --> 18:55.190
and I liked it.

18:55.192 --> 18:59.494
It tasted like ficken,
you know, like chicken-fish,

18:59.496 --> 19:04.699
and when I woke up,
the bed was wet.

19:08.805 --> 19:12.240
- The winner is...

19:12.242 --> 19:13.708
Tyler Miller!

19:13.710 --> 19:17.279
[cheers and applause]

19:22.285 --> 19:24.986
- As much as I'd wanted
to convince myself

19:24.988 --> 19:26.154
that I was Jenna 2.0,

19:26.156 --> 19:30.792
the truth was
I was still just Jenna.

19:33.196 --> 19:34.062
- Hi.

19:34.064 --> 19:35.831
- Listen, I'm sorry I didn't
tell you about the pageant,

19:35.833 --> 19:37.432
but this is why
I didn't want you to come,

19:37.434 --> 19:38.667
because I'm still
in high school,

19:38.669 --> 19:39.868
and I have
embarrassing parents,

19:39.870 --> 19:41.303
and a ridiculous amount
of ex-boyfriend drama,

19:41.305 --> 19:43.104
and if you can't handle
that, that's fine--

19:43.106 --> 19:43.705
- Jenna,

19:43.707 --> 19:46.074
I didn't leave the pageant
because I couldn't deal.

19:46.076 --> 19:46.708
- Yeah, right.

19:46.710 --> 19:48.243
- I left because what happened
to you up there

19:48.245 --> 19:49.277
was kind of rough,

19:49.279 --> 19:53.114
and I thought maybe
you could use some cheering up.

19:53.116 --> 19:56.551
Pumpkin spice,
your favorite.

19:56.553 --> 19:57.853
Wait.

20:01.324 --> 20:02.591
- I don't even know what to say.

20:02.593 --> 20:04.459
- I haven't been out of
high school that long.

20:04.461 --> 20:06.194
I haven't forgotten
the drama,

20:06.196 --> 20:09.197
and I wasn't nearly cool enough
to stage manage

20:09.199 --> 20:10.699
a male beauty pageant.

20:10.701 --> 20:11.566
- So you're not scared off?

20:11.568 --> 20:15.370
- You're going to have to
try a lot harder than that.

20:15.372 --> 20:16.605
I'm not going anywhere.

20:16.607 --> 20:20.842
I like you,
Jenna Hamilton.

20:20.844 --> 20:22.744
A lot.

20:22.746 --> 20:26.348

20:26.350 --> 20:32.020
♪

20:36.293 --> 20:37.026
- next on <i>Awkward--</i>

20:38.028 --> 20:39.294
- no one wants to see their ex
date other people.

20:39.296 --> 20:42.464
- Seeing Matty move on like
I have would make me happy.

20:42.466 --> 20:43.164
- What do you want?

20:43.166 --> 20:45.333
- I have this
great photo of you.

20:45.335 --> 20:45.901
- Nice try.

20:45.903 --> 20:48.203
Nothing happened that night,
and you know it.

20:48.205 --> 20:50.272
- My plan to make Matty
happy was working,

20:50.274 --> 20:52.307
so why was I suddenly
feeling so unhappy?

20:52.309 --> 20:53.808
It's not like I still had
feelings for him.

20:53.810 --> 20:56.745
Holy [bleep]!
I still had feelings for him.
