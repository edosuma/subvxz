Narrator:
In New York City war on crime

00:08.074 --> 00:11.613
the worst criminal offenders
are pursued by the detectives

00:11.645 --> 00:13.352
of the Major Case Squad.

00:13.380 --> 00:15.826
These are their stories.

00:17.718 --> 00:20.597
Let's see what the birds
are doing in the park.

00:20.621 --> 00:23.795
- Can you see them?
- Yes, they're playing in the trees.

00:23.824 --> 00:25.929
- ( laughs )
- ( buzzing )

00:25.959 --> 00:27.870
Oh, time for Daddy to go to work.

00:30.564 --> 00:32.566
- Good morning, everybody.
- How are you doing?

00:34.000 --> 00:40.074

00:56.757 --> 00:59.328
Good morning. First
patient's prepped in room two.

00:59.359 --> 01:01.361
She's 19, single, in the 10th week.

01:01.395 --> 01:03.341
- Name is Patricia.
- Who's here with her?

01:03.363 --> 01:06.742
One of her friends. Her boyfriend was
supposed to drive her but never showed.

01:06.767 --> 01:08.474
- How is she feeling?
- Scared.

01:08.502 --> 01:10.709
Let's see what we can do about that.

01:11.705 --> 01:13.548
- Lunch time.
- All right, children,

01:13.574 --> 01:15.645
let's close our books
and put our pencils down.

01:15.676 --> 01:17.553
Somebody want to help me with these?

01:17.578 --> 01:20.422
- Put them on the floor.
- Kids: Thank you.

01:22.349 --> 01:24.124
- Everybody ready?
- Kids: Yeah.

01:24.151 --> 01:26.461
Let's give thanks.

01:27.454 --> 01:29.991
Thank you, God, for your
bounty, today and every day.

01:30.023 --> 01:32.435
- Amen.
- Kids: Amen.

01:32.459 --> 01:34.962
Oh, and thank you, Dennis, for making lunch.

01:34.995 --> 01:37.100
Kids: Thank you.

01:38.298 --> 01:40.574
- Doctor: And what's a baby cow?
- A calf.

01:40.601 --> 01:43.878
- That's right. And what's a baby chicken?
- An egg.

01:44.905 --> 01:48.250
- I'm going to make some tea.
Does anyone want anything?
- Girl: Juice.

01:48.275 --> 01:50.653
- What comes out of the egg?
- Baby chicks.

01:50.677 --> 01:51.781
Yeah.

02:03.123 --> 02:05.330
I want to see the cars, Daddy.

02:05.359 --> 02:07.396
Okay. Come here.

02:11.932 --> 02:14.469
Lord, steady my hand

02:14.501 --> 02:17.209
and let Thy justice find its mark.

02:24.077 --> 02:26.148
- Can you see the cars?
- Yes.

02:38.625 --> 02:41.128
( whistles )

02:52.939 --> 02:55.749
Honey, are you sure you don't want any--

03:01.648 --> 03:03.491
Get into the bedroom now. Quick.

03:03.517 --> 03:06.123
Quick, quick, quick. Oh my God, Leo, hold on.

03:06.820 --> 03:08.629
Hold on.

03:08.655 --> 03:11.431
Hello, my husband's been shot.

03:11.458 --> 03:14.132
Our address is 845 Central Park West,

03:14.161 --> 03:16.698
apartment 4A. My name is Marie Cavella.

03:16.730 --> 03:19.006
Hurry. Oh my God, Leo, hold on.

03:19.032 --> 03:21.137
They're coming, honey. They're coming!

03:21.168 --> 03:23.409
Hold on! I love you!

03:23.437 --> 03:24.541
Hold on!

03:26.039 --> 03:28.178
( theme music playing )

04:24.397 --> 04:27.810
It looks like he was
80 to 100 feet into the park.

04:29.169 --> 04:31.979
That makes it about a 200-yard shot.
This guy had practice.

04:39.179 --> 04:42.058
Make sure you cover him up.

04:42.082 --> 04:44.221
In our own living room,

04:44.251 --> 04:46.322
in front of our baby.

04:46.353 --> 04:49.732
These people that say
they love children so much--

04:49.756 --> 04:52.032
Your husband get threats?

04:52.058 --> 04:54.504
There was this website,

04:54.528 --> 04:57.236
his name was on a hit list
of abortion providers,

04:57.264 --> 05:00.006
with our old address in Dobbs Ferry.

05:00.033 --> 05:02.775
It's why we moved to the city-- to be safer.

05:02.803 --> 05:06.307
Our phone's unlisted,
the condo's in my maiden name,

05:06.339 --> 05:08.148
we have a post office box.

05:08.175 --> 05:11.452
- Where was your husband's clinic?
- In Bethel.

05:11.478 --> 05:13.549
Two hours each way, every day,

05:13.580 --> 05:15.890
because he wanted to help people...

05:15.916 --> 05:18.590
They have no right.

05:18.618 --> 05:21.224
( sobbing )
Oh God, Leo.

05:22.889 --> 05:25.369
We're very sorry, Mrs. Cavella.

05:30.564 --> 05:32.066
According to the calculations,

05:32.098 --> 05:33.975
the shot came from this tree here.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.241
- Any footprints?
- Ground's too hard.

05:40.473 --> 05:42.680
Would've put his knee down here.

05:48.615 --> 05:51.824
He tied his rifle
to the tree to stabilize it...

05:52.919 --> 05:55.160
So he'd have a shooting platform.

06:04.965 --> 06:07.036
He was an experienced hunter

06:07.067 --> 06:08.842
or he had military training.

06:09.836 --> 06:11.645
How we doing on witnesses?

06:11.671 --> 06:14.117
We got one homeless lady, calls herself God,

06:14.140 --> 06:16.313
said she saw a male, white,
going into the woods

06:16.343 --> 06:18.186
about a half an hour before the shooting.

06:18.211 --> 06:20.384
Put "God" together with a sketch artist.

06:20.413 --> 06:22.723
Keep the witness canvass
going for the next week,

06:22.749 --> 06:25.457
double up in the evenings
around the time of the shooting.

06:30.457 --> 06:31.959
Eames!

06:31.992 --> 06:34.973
( camera shutters clicking )

06:35.829 --> 06:38.400
It's a Remington 703-aught-8,

06:38.431 --> 06:41.503
with a Burris 3x10 scope.

06:41.534 --> 06:43.673
He brought it here piece by piece,

06:43.703 --> 06:46.115
assembled, buried it until he needed it.

06:46.139 --> 06:49.552
I can already tell catching this mutt's
going to be a walk in the park.

06:52.679 --> 06:56.126
There are killers and there are people
who kill abortion doctors.

06:56.149 --> 06:57.719
There's two types of those: the martyr--

06:57.751 --> 07:00.391
he kills without a lot of planning
in broad daylight,

07:00.420 --> 07:03.401
in front of witnesses,
with a shotgun or a handgun,

07:03.423 --> 07:04.925
doesn't care if he gets caught.

07:04.958 --> 07:06.198
Then there's this guy.

07:06.226 --> 07:08.866
Months of preparation, stalks his target,

07:08.895 --> 07:12.365
plans his escape, kills from a distance,

07:12.399 --> 07:14.436
no intention of getting caught.

07:14.467 --> 07:16.811
He's in it to create fear.

07:16.836 --> 07:20.181
You know, kill one, scare a thousand.

07:20.206 --> 07:22.914
Three witnesses, including God,
saw a male, white,

07:22.943 --> 07:25.753
come out of the woods near
the 97th Street transverse.

07:25.779 --> 07:28.316
30s, medium to tall, baseball cap,

07:28.348 --> 07:30.055
maybe a mustache, maybe brown hair.

07:30.083 --> 07:33.155
Maybe we put up fliers in the park,
maybe we get better witnesses.

07:33.186 --> 07:34.756
Take a look at this website.

07:34.788 --> 07:36.495
"The New Killing Fields."

07:36.523 --> 07:38.503
Lists abortion doctors in every state.

07:38.525 --> 07:42.496
Here. Leo Cavella. Still his old address.

07:42.529 --> 07:45.032
Any guesses what the slash
through his name means?

07:45.065 --> 07:47.909
- It's a damn hit list.
- Protected by the First Amendment.

07:47.934 --> 07:50.915
- Of course.
- Ballistics report on the rifle.

07:50.937 --> 07:52.939
Figures, no fingerprints.

07:52.973 --> 07:56.113
Rifle traced to a gun dealer in Pennsylvania

07:56.142 --> 07:58.952
who sold it at a gun show
in Honesdale eight weeks ago.

07:58.979 --> 08:02.586
- No ID on the buyer.
- Honesdale-- that's just across the state line

08:02.615 --> 08:04.595
from Cavella's clinic in Bethel.

08:07.153 --> 08:10.157
My husband drove Leo's van.
He never noticed anyone following.

08:10.190 --> 08:12.670
What about the people with the signs?
They regulars?

08:12.692 --> 08:14.865
Every day since the clinic opened
four years ago.

08:14.894 --> 08:17.465
- We videotape them.
- We'll need those tapes.

08:17.497 --> 08:20.068
Those people are horrible,
always calling us names,

08:20.100 --> 08:22.546
yelling at the patients.

08:22.569 --> 08:26.073
Who on Dr. Cavella's staff had his address?

08:26.106 --> 08:27.380
I did, in my address book,

08:27.407 --> 08:29.284
which I kept locked up in my office.

08:29.309 --> 08:31.653
Doctor Cavella's check register.

08:31.678 --> 08:34.591
Checks to Con Ed, to his condo board.

08:34.614 --> 08:36.491
After he paid his bills,
what did he do with them?

08:36.515 --> 08:39.895
Some he took home, some like
his power bill he threw away.

08:39.919 --> 08:42.798
- Any problems with his trash bin outside?
- A couple months ago.

08:42.822 --> 08:46.360
The police said it was raccoons.
We bought cans with animal-proof lids.

08:46.393 --> 08:47.838
How'd that work out?

08:47.861 --> 08:51.104
Two weeks later, they got broken into again.

08:51.131 --> 08:54.738
Animal-proof lids.
Nobody ever gives raccoons enough credit.

08:54.768 --> 08:56.645
Your money's still on the raccoons.

08:56.669 --> 09:00.378
I just can't imagine anybody
scrounging around for a Con Ed bill.

09:00.407 --> 09:02.478
Cavella's address would be on a Con Ed bill.

09:02.509 --> 09:04.386
What did your investigation turn up?

09:04.411 --> 09:05.583
Well, not much.

09:05.612 --> 09:08.616
Somebody saw a car parked across
the street, that was about it.

09:08.648 --> 09:10.093
A car is something.

09:10.116 --> 09:13.393
Well, the plates traced to Mr.
and Mrs. McLeish in White Lake.

09:13.420 --> 09:15.093
They're a nice couple in their 60s.

09:15.121 --> 09:18.659
I don't figure they climbed that
eight-foot fence around those trash cans.

09:18.691 --> 09:21.638
Any history of anti-abortion activity?

09:21.661 --> 09:24.767
They chained themselves
to the door of the clinic last year.

09:24.798 --> 09:26.675
Got 12 monthsâ€™ probation.

09:26.699 --> 09:28.872
Well, I'll bet that included
a restraining order

09:28.902 --> 09:30.813
to stay away from the clinic.

09:30.837 --> 09:32.248
Well, yes, it did.

09:32.272 --> 09:34.548
Sounds like they violated their probation.

09:37.210 --> 09:39.816
Please! For the last time,
you don't have a choice here!

09:39.846 --> 09:41.416
You got to let us in.

09:41.448 --> 09:43.621
( muttering voices )

09:47.187 --> 09:49.030
You ain't going to need those.

09:49.055 --> 09:51.592
You didn't see the hole in Cavella's chest.

09:53.226 --> 09:55.206
Woman: Give us this day our daily bread.

09:55.228 --> 09:59.506
Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive
those who trespass against us.

09:59.532 --> 10:02.479
Mr. and Mrs. McLeish, we have
a bench warrant for your arrest

10:02.502 --> 10:04.743
for violation of your probation.

10:04.771 --> 10:06.876
They're not going anywhere
without the radiator.

10:06.906 --> 10:08.647
The locks are laced through it.

10:08.675 --> 10:11.679
- ...forgive those who trespass against us.
- Hallowed be Thy name.

10:11.711 --> 10:13.850
Eames: Hey, Bobby.

10:17.150 --> 10:20.597
The neighbors say they had somebody
staying with them six weeks ago.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.725
Male, white, mid to late 30s,

10:22.755 --> 10:24.325
brown hair, beard.

10:24.357 --> 10:25.927
They saw him driving their car.

10:25.959 --> 10:28.565
- Damn.
- What's the problem?

10:28.595 --> 10:30.802
Blade's stuck.

10:30.830 --> 10:34.073
Somebody put steel pipes around the locks,

10:34.100 --> 10:36.478
then stuck metal rods inside the pipes,

10:36.503 --> 10:38.915
so my blades are just spinning.

10:38.938 --> 10:40.679
I got to change blades.

10:40.707 --> 10:42.709
You all better get comfortable.

10:43.710 --> 10:46.452
What'd they use when they chained
themselves to the clinic?

10:46.479 --> 10:49.949
Just a padlock and a bicycle chain.
We cut them loose in a minute flat.

10:55.054 --> 10:58.035
Deakins: Nine hours to cut them out.
That's just great.

10:58.057 --> 11:00.435
We have a sketch of Ma and
Pa Kettle's house guest.

11:00.460 --> 11:03.703
We tried one without the beard and
showed it to the Central Park witnesses.

11:03.730 --> 11:06.904
- No definite hits, but it's close.
- Got him.

11:06.933 --> 11:08.810
The old couple didn't have the tools

11:08.835 --> 11:10.781
or materials to make the locks.

11:10.803 --> 11:12.680
I figured the house guest made them.

11:12.705 --> 11:14.685
I did a search for protesters

11:14.707 --> 11:16.345
who blockaded abortion clinics

11:16.376 --> 11:18.185
by chaining themselves to the doors.

11:18.211 --> 11:19.884
The longer it takes to remove them,

11:19.913 --> 11:21.824
the longer the clinics have to shut down.

11:24.584 --> 11:27.394
One guy got famous in Wisconsin

11:27.420 --> 11:30.765
for teaching people how to make locks
that took up to 12 hours to remove.

11:30.790 --> 11:32.997
He did it with steel pipes,

11:33.026 --> 11:35.131
metal rods, abrasives--

11:35.161 --> 11:37.437
meet Dennis Griscom.

11:38.598 --> 11:41.306
From locks to lock 'n' load.

11:41.334 --> 11:43.712
Next stop for Mr. Griscom is lockup.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.346
Griscom has two convictions

11:49.375 --> 11:51.355
for anti-abortion activities

11:51.377 --> 11:53.983
in Wisconsin and Florida. He served 60 days.

11:54.013 --> 11:56.015
He's been off the radar the last 4 years.

11:56.049 --> 11:59.087
And there's fiber evidence.
A hair on the stick left at the scene

11:59.118 --> 12:01.598
matched a hair from a blanket
in the McLeish's house.

12:01.621 --> 12:04.431
A probable match, not conclusive.

12:04.457 --> 12:06.459
What's the old folks' involvement?

12:06.492 --> 12:09.336
They're being transported here
for questioning. We'll see.

12:09.362 --> 12:10.807
Goren: Heâ€™s done with them.

12:10.830 --> 12:13.140
He'll seek support from other zealots.

12:13.166 --> 12:15.806
He's a terrorist, with a profound dedication

12:15.835 --> 12:17.815
to an over-valued idea,

12:17.837 --> 12:21.148
one that's his sole focus in life.

12:21.174 --> 12:23.415
Zealot, terrorist--

12:23.443 --> 12:25.514
loaded terms, Detective.

12:25.545 --> 12:28.253
I hope you're not suggesting
he represents a movement.

12:30.550 --> 12:33.656
Well, I'm suggesting he might think he is

12:33.686 --> 12:35.222
and act accordingly.

12:38.858 --> 12:40.667
This is a murder case.

12:40.693 --> 12:44.197
Let's not turn into a litmus test on abortion.

12:50.370 --> 12:52.816
Sounds like it already is.

12:55.208 --> 12:57.347
I couldn't sleep the night before.

12:57.377 --> 12:59.914
I felt like I had a lead weight in my chest,

12:59.946 --> 13:02.358
and the closer I got to
doing it, the worse I felt.

13:02.382 --> 13:05.124
I didn't feel brave, I
didn't feel full of fire.

13:05.151 --> 13:08.030
Providence spoke to you, Dennis.
You had no choice.

13:08.054 --> 13:10.830
When I looked though that scope...

13:14.994 --> 13:18.305
It was like the Lord slipped
his hand inside mine,

13:18.331 --> 13:20.333
like a glove, you know?

13:20.366 --> 13:22.812
And put his finger around the trigger.

13:22.835 --> 13:24.815
That's exactly what he did.

13:24.837 --> 13:26.817
He helped you save the babies.

13:27.674 --> 13:28.880
I just--

13:28.908 --> 13:31.684
I can't shake this sadness I'm feeling.

13:31.711 --> 13:34.123
You're not alone in this.
People will help you.

13:34.147 --> 13:36.184
Okay?

13:37.684 --> 13:39.527
Here's $500.

13:43.356 --> 13:46.166
If you need any more, send a message.

13:46.192 --> 13:49.833
- Thank you.
- Hey.

13:49.862 --> 13:51.864
Thank you.

14:04.811 --> 14:07.451
We have witnesses who saw
him near the shooting,

14:07.480 --> 14:10.859
forensic evidence linking him to it.

14:13.653 --> 14:15.997
How can you protect him?

14:18.691 --> 14:20.967
I saw books in your home

14:20.993 --> 14:24.133
by Gandhi, Martin Luther King--

14:24.163 --> 14:27.804
Apostles of non-violence.

14:27.834 --> 14:31.008
I know that you follow in their footsteps.

14:32.672 --> 14:35.152
Conscientious objector in the '50s.

14:36.342 --> 14:39.152
Voter registration in the '60s.

14:39.178 --> 14:41.784
You marched against Vietnam,

14:43.182 --> 14:46.095
apartheid, abortion.

14:46.119 --> 14:48.998
Always by non-violent means, right?

14:49.021 --> 14:51.058
Yes.

14:54.193 --> 14:57.367
I found these in your home.

14:58.364 --> 15:01.038
You and your wife at candlelight vigils.

15:01.067 --> 15:03.946
You oppose the death penalty.

15:03.970 --> 15:06.280
Any kind of killing.

15:06.305 --> 15:10.117
I have a lot of respect
for that position, Mr. McLeish.

15:12.645 --> 15:17.424
There's no hypocrisy to it,
no double standard...

15:21.821 --> 15:24.825
Even for doctors like Leo Cavella.

15:30.163 --> 15:32.302
Even for him, right?

15:42.842 --> 15:44.515
Mrs. McLeish: God forgive us.

15:44.544 --> 15:47.457
We didn't know what he was planning.

15:47.480 --> 15:49.482
How'd you meet Griscom?

15:50.750 --> 15:54.789
At a movement conference
in Memphis last spring.

15:54.821 --> 15:57.324
There were old friends
from Operation Rescue,

15:57.356 --> 15:59.199
and some people we didn't know,

15:59.225 --> 16:02.468
radicals who said the Lord wanted us

16:02.495 --> 16:05.704
to pick up the sword
and kill more abortionists.

16:05.731 --> 16:07.972
Was Griscom one of the radicals?

16:08.000 --> 16:10.446
No. He just listened.

16:12.305 --> 16:14.945
He never said anything about Dr. Cavella,

16:14.974 --> 16:16.453
or buying a rifle.

16:16.476 --> 16:18.080
What did he do all day?

16:18.110 --> 16:19.453
- Did he have a job?
- No.

16:19.479 --> 16:22.016
He had savings, he said.

16:22.048 --> 16:25.086
Mostly, he helped around the place.

16:25.117 --> 16:27.063
I took him bird watching.

16:27.086 --> 16:29.566
There's a bald eagle preserve near Goshen.

16:29.589 --> 16:32.968
Even gave him an old pair of binoculars.

16:32.992 --> 16:35.131
- What kind?
- Zeiss.

16:36.662 --> 16:39.438
He was a serious young man,

16:39.465 --> 16:42.537
who didn't know what direction
he was supposed to go.

16:42.568 --> 16:44.980
How did he end up staying with you?

16:45.004 --> 16:46.483
We invited him to visit.

16:46.506 --> 16:48.315
One day he showed up.

16:48.341 --> 16:51.481
Goren: Did he talk about any
friends in the movement,

16:51.511 --> 16:53.650
people who might help him?

16:53.679 --> 16:56.990
No. Only people he talked
about were his parents,

16:57.016 --> 16:58.518
his father mostly.

16:58.551 --> 17:00.553
And what did he say about him?

17:00.586 --> 17:03.590
Well, he told me he was an engineer.

17:03.623 --> 17:05.933
He said his father was proud of him.

17:07.960 --> 17:09.734
And that mattered to him?

17:09.762 --> 17:11.742
Sure.

17:11.763 --> 17:14.335
His father sounded like a hard man to please.

17:17.303 --> 17:20.113
Any idea where he stayed after he left?

17:20.138 --> 17:22.618
- I think with family.
- What makes you say that?

17:22.642 --> 17:25.452
Before he left, he came
with me to the Wal-Mart

17:25.478 --> 17:27.515
to buy some gifts for his nieces.

17:27.547 --> 17:29.356
Is that who he said they were for?

17:29.382 --> 17:31.623
No, but he bought two key chains

17:31.651 --> 17:33.961
with kittens on them and
the initials "K" and "R,"

17:33.986 --> 17:35.829
so I assumed that's who they were for.

17:41.494 --> 17:43.804
Dennis doesn't have any nieces.

17:43.829 --> 17:47.299
He has a nephew-- my
daughter's son, in Seattle.

17:47.333 --> 17:50.473
When was the last time you talked to him?

17:50.503 --> 17:54.349
Maybe six months ago, I'm not sure.

17:55.675 --> 17:58.451
I see your husband was a marksman in Vietnam.

18:00.012 --> 18:02.754
Is this him hunting with Dennis?

18:02.782 --> 18:04.921
Yes.

18:04.951 --> 18:07.329
They look like they're good pals. Are they?

18:09.555 --> 18:11.432
My husband died a year ago.

18:11.457 --> 18:14.097
Dennis looked up to him.

18:14.126 --> 18:17.471
He told people his father was proud of him.

18:20.466 --> 18:23.675
- When was this taken?
- Maybe last year.

18:26.806 --> 18:28.786
Zeiss binoculars.

18:32.211 --> 18:34.282
This was taken two months ago...

18:35.848 --> 18:39.159
In the area where Dr. Cavella
had his clinic.

18:40.152 --> 18:43.292
He didn't shoot that doctor.

18:43.322 --> 18:47.327
10 years ago he became
a missionary to help people.

18:48.661 --> 18:51.505
He couldn't hurt anyone.

18:52.498 --> 18:55.308
He won't be safe unless he talks to us.

18:55.334 --> 18:58.281
Please, how did you get this picture?

19:03.275 --> 19:04.549
(sighs)

19:10.016 --> 19:12.997
I found this on the porch a month ago.

19:13.019 --> 19:15.590
It's just books and letters.

19:16.722 --> 19:18.759
- Was there a note?
- No.

19:18.791 --> 19:20.600
He just left it on the porch,

19:20.626 --> 19:22.833
he didn't even ring the doorbell.

19:23.929 --> 19:25.738
I found that picture inside.

19:25.765 --> 19:29.406
Did you recognize any of the people
in these other pictures?

19:29.435 --> 19:31.676
- No.
- Do you know Lori Carlson?

19:31.704 --> 19:34.275
- No.
- This is addressed to Dennis.

19:34.306 --> 19:36.286
"Dear Dennis, we hope this finds you well.

19:36.308 --> 19:39.585
Yesterday we took Katie
and Ruthie to the Botanical Gardens.

19:39.612 --> 19:42.388
They love going there
and witnessing the Lord's wonders.

19:42.415 --> 19:46.659
We all miss you. Please call."
Signed, "Lori Carlson."

19:46.686 --> 19:49.792
It's postmarked last October in Brooklyn.

19:49.822 --> 19:53.326
K and R-- Katie and Ruthie
Carlson in Brooklyn.

19:53.359 --> 19:55.032
It's a start.

19:55.061 --> 19:57.837
( doorbell rings )

19:57.863 --> 19:59.274
- Lori Carlson?
- Yes?

19:59.298 --> 20:02.302
- This is a warrant allowing us to
search your house.
- What's going on?

20:02.334 --> 20:05.076
- Stay in here with your children.
- Two upstairs. You two with me.

20:05.104 --> 20:07.141
Are there any adults here besides yourself?

20:07.173 --> 20:09.153
- No. Why are you here?
- Officer: Clear!

20:09.175 --> 20:11.985
We're looking for Dennis Griscom.

20:12.011 --> 20:15.390
Mrs. Carlson, we're conducting
a murder investigation.

20:15.414 --> 20:18.020
Now is not the time to lie to the police.

20:19.685 --> 20:24.156
Dennis left four days ago.
I don't know where he went.

20:24.190 --> 20:25.999
What room was he staying in?

20:26.025 --> 20:28.027
Down the stairs.

20:29.061 --> 20:30.631
Shh.

20:59.225 --> 21:00.966
Eames, I need a bag.

21:05.998 --> 21:08.478
Suspicious dust balls?

21:08.501 --> 21:10.174
It's spun glass.

21:10.202 --> 21:12.648
Commonly used to make silencers.

21:12.671 --> 21:15.811
There was no attachment
for a silencer on the Remington.

21:15.841 --> 21:18.151
No. it's from a second rifle.

21:18.177 --> 21:20.020
He's not done yet.

21:24.350 --> 21:26.489
I don't know where he was planning to go.

21:26.519 --> 21:28.362
He mention other doctors or clinics?

21:28.387 --> 21:30.424
No. He didn't talk about things like that.

21:30.456 --> 21:32.561
I don't believe he did the things you say.

21:32.591 --> 21:36.004
But if he did, then he must believe
he's doing God's will,

21:36.028 --> 21:38.508
and then it's up to God to deal' with him.

21:38.531 --> 21:40.067
Maybe God's too busy

21:40.099 --> 21:43.546
dealing with Leo Cavella's
5-year-old daughter.

21:43.569 --> 21:47.381
She was standing next to him when
your friend's bullet tore into him.

21:47.406 --> 21:50.649
Goren: I noticed there are no posters

21:50.676 --> 21:52.656
of pop singers in your daughters rooms,

21:52.678 --> 21:54.680
or pictures of athletes.

21:54.713 --> 21:56.488
We don't approve of that.

21:56.515 --> 21:58.392
Well, how about...

22:00.486 --> 22:02.295
Soccer and tennis?

22:02.321 --> 22:03.857
I didn't see any equipment.

22:03.889 --> 22:08.634
We don't participate in those parts of the
culture that don't bring glory to God.

22:08.661 --> 22:11.801
Dennis, he dragged
this abomination,

22:11.831 --> 22:14.573
this execution into your living room.

22:16.135 --> 22:18.775
How can that bring glory to God?

22:21.340 --> 22:25.379
We have every reason to believe
he's going to kill again.

22:35.354 --> 22:37.027
Dennis...

22:39.024 --> 22:42.494
Dennis was on the computer a lot,

22:42.528 --> 22:46.066
talking to other people when we weren't home.

22:49.034 --> 22:51.036
Please, don't hurt him.

22:57.209 --> 22:59.086
We found some of Griscom's e-mails.

22:59.111 --> 23:01.614
Just their tracks.
The actual e-mails were long gone.

23:01.647 --> 23:05.459
Most of the e-mails around the time of the
shooting are to and from one address.

23:05.484 --> 23:07.361
Zach here thinks he can chase it down.

23:07.386 --> 23:08.956
Zach here has chased him down.

23:08.988 --> 23:11.468
It's linked to a website.

23:11.490 --> 23:13.470
Whoa! This is extreme.

23:13.492 --> 23:17.634
"Stop abortion on demand
by the most direct means possible."

23:17.663 --> 23:19.301
Looks like Griscom found a friend.

23:19.331 --> 23:21.470
There's a PO box address in Long Island.

23:21.500 --> 23:22.638
If we find this clown,

23:22.668 --> 23:25.808
any way we can monitor his e-mail
traffic in case Griscom contacts him?

23:25.838 --> 23:27.681
You can.

23:27.706 --> 23:30.778
If you install a spying
application on his computer.

23:36.515 --> 23:39.826
You can look all you want,
you won't find any guns here.

23:39.852 --> 23:42.560
Your website said,
"The most direct means possible."

23:42.588 --> 23:44.829
Everyone knows what that means, Mr. Cutler.

23:44.857 --> 23:47.838
It means whatever you need it to mean.

23:47.860 --> 23:50.602
I'm just a truck driver.
I never threatened anybody.

23:50.629 --> 23:52.506
What about the Supreme Court?

23:52.531 --> 23:54.568
I wouldn't hurt a hair on those gentlemen.

23:54.600 --> 23:56.705
But the two women on the Court,
they're fair game?

23:56.735 --> 24:00.706
Ma'am, God's never told me to kill anybody.

24:00.739 --> 24:02.650
Eames: But if He did, I bet you would.

24:02.675 --> 24:04.621
I'd obey him, just like Abraham did.

24:04.643 --> 24:07.624
- I heard a threat to a government official.
- The hell you did.

24:07.646 --> 24:10.092
I'm taking you in. Turn around.

24:10.115 --> 24:12.652
- This is bull. You can't do thisâ€”
- Shut your mouth.

24:12.685 --> 24:15.529
Maybe you read only the parts
of the Bible you like,

24:15.554 --> 24:17.534
but what I remember from Sunday school

24:17.556 --> 24:19.934
is God stopped Abraham from killing.

24:19.959 --> 24:22.235
I'll get downtown started on the complaint.

24:25.497 --> 24:28.205
Let's step in here, Mr. Cutler.

24:28.233 --> 24:30.804
Hey, Harland, it's me, Eames,

24:30.836 --> 24:33.442
I need you to fill out a complaint for me.

24:33.472 --> 24:36.009
Suspect's name is Lorne Cutler.

24:36.041 --> 24:38.043
You take orders from that lady?

24:38.077 --> 24:40.921
She's got seniority.

24:40.946 --> 24:42.983
You know these women on the force,

24:43.015 --> 24:45.928
they come with an extra set of brass ones.

24:47.619 --> 24:50.498
- Is that better?
- Yes, thank you.

24:50.522 --> 24:53.731
The TPO is the suspect's home
at 428 Powell Street

24:53.759 --> 24:57.206
in Bayside, New York. Okay, PH hold.

24:58.764 --> 25:02.143
You admire this man,
the one who shot the doctor?

25:02.167 --> 25:04.147
He killed to protect innocent life.

25:04.169 --> 25:06.615
He heard God's command and he obeyed.

25:06.638 --> 25:09.209
Yeah, like Saint Joan, and
the Knights Templar.

25:11.143 --> 25:13.555
I read your website. I get it.

25:15.481 --> 25:20.396
The government is using
these statutes and lawsuits

25:20.419 --> 25:23.628
by pro-abortion groups
to cut off all legitimate protest.

25:23.655 --> 25:27.728
So if you believe that the soul
enters a body at conception...

25:31.830 --> 25:34.003
You have to take the next step.

25:34.033 --> 25:36.104
Shutting down those killing fields...

25:37.770 --> 25:41.877
It's the only cause left
worth dying for, isn't it?

25:43.776 --> 25:45.949
There is no higher calling.

25:50.349 --> 25:52.955
I'm glad this person skipped the state.

25:54.286 --> 25:56.926
I don't have to be involved in his arrest.

25:59.091 --> 26:01.367
Where do you think he went?

26:01.393 --> 26:04.533
Let's just say he's not on
this side of the Mason-Dixon.

26:07.132 --> 26:08.770
We got to kick him.

26:08.801 --> 26:11.247
Downtown won't sign off on the complaint.

26:12.805 --> 26:14.807
What did I tell you?

26:19.545 --> 26:21.354
Goren: Now Cutler is writing e-mails.

26:21.380 --> 26:24.793
Eames: "All it takes is for one state
to threaten sedition over abortion

26:24.817 --> 26:27.491
and this thing will turn around.
There's reason to hope.

26:27.519 --> 26:31.490
We have friends in surprising places--
even in the New York City police.

26:31.523 --> 26:34.436
I met a detective who
thinks picking up the sword

26:34.460 --> 26:38.340
is the only option left to stop
the abortion factories."

26:39.832 --> 26:42.870
- You told him that?
- Mm-hmm. To earn his confidence.

26:42.901 --> 26:45.814
Not to mention his love and admiration.

26:45.838 --> 26:48.785
True believers expect everyone
to think like them.

26:51.677 --> 26:53.657
(sighs)

26:53.679 --> 26:55.556
What do you really think?

26:55.581 --> 26:58.619
I'll tell you what I
think when I get pregnant.

26:58.650 --> 27:01.290
You're going to have to do
a lot better than that, Bobby.

27:03.956 --> 27:05.196
Okay.

27:10.796 --> 27:12.776
Life is full of uncertainty.

27:12.798 --> 27:15.472
People need to have options.

27:15.501 --> 27:18.414
Abortion has got to be one of those options.

27:20.472 --> 27:22.145
That's what I think.

27:22.174 --> 27:25.155
He just got pulled into a private chat.

27:28.680 --> 27:30.421
Goren: Okay. That's Griscom.

27:30.449 --> 27:33.157
I gave Cutler misinformation
about our investigation.

27:33.185 --> 27:35.563
Can you trace him?

27:35.587 --> 27:38.261
He's a guest on somebody else's account.

27:38.290 --> 27:41.828
The account is registered
with Barbara's Place,

27:41.860 --> 27:43.897
it's a copy store chain.

27:45.097 --> 27:47.304
( chatting )

27:47.332 --> 27:49.334
Susan!

27:52.504 --> 27:54.142
Dennis?

27:54.173 --> 27:55.811
What are you doing here?

27:55.841 --> 27:58.253
The alumni office told me where you worked.

27:59.344 --> 28:01.915
Are you all right? How are your parents?

28:01.947 --> 28:03.449
Dad passed away last year.

28:03.482 --> 28:06.088
I'm so sorry.

28:06.118 --> 28:09.361
- Your boyfriend?
- No.

28:09.388 --> 28:11.766
I'm engaged.

28:11.790 --> 28:14.100
I'm getting married in a few months.

28:15.794 --> 28:17.535
You going to have kids?

28:19.965 --> 28:21.638
Maybe.

28:23.468 --> 28:25.141
I have something for you.

28:27.472 --> 28:29.315
Not exactly a wedding present.

28:31.210 --> 28:33.281
They were my Dad's when he was in the army.

28:33.312 --> 28:35.258
He always liked you a lot.

28:38.650 --> 28:42.063
- This is very sweet of you, Dennis.
- Have a good life, Susan.

28:47.659 --> 28:50.936
I was so angry, for so long.

28:50.963 --> 28:52.840
But I was angry at the wrong person.

29:04.443 --> 29:08.084
Yeah, he's been in here using
the computers a few times.

29:08.113 --> 29:09.922
Last night, as a matter of fact.

29:09.948 --> 29:11.894
- How did he pay?
- Cash.

29:11.917 --> 29:13.919
He never stays on the computer long.

29:13.952 --> 29:17.263
- What did he use for ID?
- This guy didn't have any ID.

29:17.289 --> 29:18.393
I think he's homeless.

29:18.423 --> 29:20.767
I let him leave a meal card
from Saint Mark's Mission.

29:41.480 --> 29:43.824
Buddy, if I were you, I'd taste it first.

29:43.849 --> 29:46.125
Hey, ease off on him.

29:46.151 --> 29:48.631
There's plenty to be grateful for, yeah?

29:48.654 --> 29:52.124
Go ahead. Go ahead.
Say grace, preacher. Go ahead.

29:52.157 --> 29:54.569
It wouldn't kill any of us to have
a little gratitude.

29:59.831 --> 30:03.677
Thank you, God, for your bounty
today and every day. Amen.

30:03.702 --> 30:05.613
Amen.

30:10.008 --> 30:12.045
Easy!

30:12.077 --> 30:15.524
- Our Father who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy name...
- All right. Stand up!

30:16.515 --> 30:18.927
Goren: Youâ€™re going to have to carry him.

30:18.950 --> 30:21.157
Give us this day our daily bread,

30:21.186 --> 30:22.790
and forgive us our trespasses,

30:22.821 --> 30:25.495
as we forgive those who trespass against us.

30:28.593 --> 30:31.403
Eames: We have you pegged every
inch of the way, Dennis.

30:31.430 --> 30:34.070
Where you bought the rifle,
how you got his address,

30:34.099 --> 30:36.477
where you stayed in Brooklyn.

30:36.501 --> 30:39.107
The state's got you for second-degree murder.

30:41.506 --> 30:43.611
That's 25 years to life.

30:43.642 --> 30:45.622
But the Feds also have jurisdiction.

30:45.644 --> 30:46.987
That's the death penalty.

30:47.012 --> 30:48.855
You don't show some cooperation,

30:48.880 --> 30:51.156
we're going to let them throw you the party.

30:52.484 --> 30:55.988
Goren: Let's talk about the second rifle,
the one you made your silencer for

30:56.021 --> 30:58.661
You stashed it, buried it, whatever.

30:58.690 --> 31:01.398
We need to find it before someone else does.

31:01.426 --> 31:04.464
Eames: You don't want some
poor kid to get shot, do you?

31:04.496 --> 31:06.635
It won't be incriminating.

31:06.665 --> 31:08.667
You can say you were throwing it away,

31:08.700 --> 31:10.941
or you saw somebody put it there.

31:10.969 --> 31:13.848
But you don't tell us,
and God forbid something happens,

31:13.872 --> 31:16.011
you think the big guy's
going to forgive you?

31:16.041 --> 31:17.987
The big guy?

31:18.009 --> 31:19.784
You trivialize him.

31:19.811 --> 31:24.282
You pretend to know
what He will or will not forgive.

31:26.351 --> 31:28.661
I'm a soldier in the Lord's army.

31:28.687 --> 31:31.361
My conscience is clear.

31:31.390 --> 31:35.668
And you, you have a duty
to protect innocent life.

31:35.694 --> 31:38.368
So youâ€™re going to do
the right thing now, aren't you?

31:40.198 --> 31:43.042
You're going to open that door
and let me walk out of here.

31:59.918 --> 32:02.956
In five, 10, maybe 15 years,

32:02.988 --> 32:05.696
people like whoever killed this Dr. Cavella,

32:05.724 --> 32:08.568
they're going to be heroes in this country.

32:08.593 --> 32:12.166
- What do we have on him?
- Hindering prosecution.

32:12.197 --> 32:14.336
Nothing that implicates him in a conspiracy.

32:14.366 --> 32:15.811
And Griscom?

32:15.834 --> 32:17.643
The best evidence we have against him

32:17.669 --> 32:19.808
is still the hair we found at the scene.

32:19.838 --> 32:21.476
A single hair?

32:21.506 --> 32:24.487
We have 48 hours to bring
him up for arraignment.

32:24.509 --> 32:27.979
With what we have now,
I might not be able to hold him.

32:28.013 --> 32:29.822
What's he doing?

32:29.848 --> 32:31.850
He's praying.

32:33.351 --> 32:35.991
Speaking of litmus tests,

32:36.021 --> 32:37.625
assuming we get the goods on him,

32:37.656 --> 32:41.194
how do you try him without having
it turn into a three-ring circus?

32:41.226 --> 32:44.435
By inoculating the jury
against Griscom's defense.

32:44.463 --> 32:47.137
He's going to claim he killed
to protect unborn children.

32:47.165 --> 32:49.338
Inoculate them, how?

32:49.367 --> 32:53.509
By telling the jury you agree
with Griscom on abortion?

32:53.538 --> 32:55.176
It crossed my mind.

32:55.207 --> 32:59.451
You really believe abortion is murder?

33:01.313 --> 33:04.294
Like I said, long as you
bring me the evidence,

33:04.316 --> 33:07.729
convicting this... gentleman
shouldn't be a problem.

33:07.752 --> 33:09.231
(sighs)

33:14.326 --> 33:16.966
Promise me a margarita when this is all over.

33:18.830 --> 33:21.470
The copying place sent over a list of websites

33:21.500 --> 33:23.980
Griscom visited on their computer.

33:24.002 --> 33:25.811
Look at this one.

33:25.837 --> 33:28.943
Hudson University Alumni Association.

33:33.345 --> 33:35.916
Goren: The Association said he looked you up.

33:35.947 --> 33:38.484
When did you last talk to him?

33:38.517 --> 33:40.326
Three days ago.

33:40.352 --> 33:43.663
I was on my way out to lunch
and he just walked up to me.

33:43.688 --> 33:45.167
What did he want?

33:45.190 --> 33:47.670
He had something for me, from his father.

33:47.692 --> 33:50.195
- He died last year.
- Goren: What was it?

33:55.867 --> 33:58.347
I don't know why Dennis thought I'd want them.

33:58.370 --> 34:00.611
I was never particularly fond of his dad.

34:00.639 --> 34:03.449
He was really hard on Dennis.

34:03.475 --> 34:05.614
How long had it been since you talked to him?

34:05.644 --> 34:08.250
Almost 10 years.

34:08.280 --> 34:10.783
What happened between the two of you?

34:14.152 --> 34:16.757
Something was eating away
at him all these years.

34:18.156 --> 34:20.136
These mementos were precious to him,

34:20.158 --> 34:21.795
but he gave them to you. Why?

34:26.498 --> 34:30.105
Dennis had this idea
that we were going to get married

34:30.135 --> 34:33.139
and help the poor and have a lot of kids.

34:33.170 --> 34:36.152
I respected those goals and I loved him,

34:36.174 --> 34:39.485
but I had another life in mind

34:39.511 --> 34:41.889
and then I got pregnant.

34:41.913 --> 34:45.087
Dennis was so happy

34:45.116 --> 34:49.257
and I thought it was the worst thing
that could've happened to me.

34:49.286 --> 34:52.359
So I started talking about having an abortion.

34:54.859 --> 34:56.634
Dennis went crazy.

34:58.330 --> 35:01.311
Yeah. He ordered me not to do it.

35:02.801 --> 35:04.940
He put pictures of aborted fetuses

35:04.970 --> 35:06.278
all around our apartment.

35:06.304 --> 35:09.183
Told me I'd be murdering his child,

35:09.207 --> 35:12.450
as if what was inside me was
more important to him than I was.

35:13.445 --> 35:15.891
So that's when I made up my mind.

35:15.914 --> 35:19.953
I waited until he went to work,
I packed up and left.

35:19.985 --> 35:22.989
I went to the clinic and I
never saw Dennis again.

35:28.126 --> 35:30.299
I've got to put him in
front of a judge in an hour.

35:30.328 --> 35:33.935
You've got less time than that to get
some kind of admission out of him.

35:33.965 --> 35:36.639
My client has a date in arraignment court.

35:36.668 --> 35:39.012
There are a few things we need
to clear up with him first.

35:39.037 --> 35:40.914
He's invoking his right to be silent.

35:40.939 --> 35:44.751
He doesn't have a right to be deaf, so he'll
have to listen to what we have to say.

35:47.512 --> 35:51.324
First thing, there's nothing
in your file about children.

35:51.349 --> 35:53.158
Do you have any kids?

35:56.354 --> 35:58.960
No. I took a vow of celibacy.

35:58.990 --> 36:01.630
You never wanted any kids?
You don't like them?

36:01.660 --> 36:05.107
Mm-mm, I love kids.

36:05.130 --> 36:08.270
But that's not what God had planned for me.

36:08.299 --> 36:10.973
You think you would've been a good parent?

36:12.370 --> 36:14.316
Better than your father?

36:16.474 --> 36:19.546
There's nothing wrong with the
way my father brought me up.

36:19.577 --> 36:21.853
He thought there was
a lot wrong with you, didn't he?

36:21.880 --> 36:23.860
My dad was proud of me.

36:23.882 --> 36:26.624
Is that why you became--
what is it you called yourself?

36:26.651 --> 36:29.325
"A soldier in the Lord's army"?

36:30.321 --> 36:32.892
To prove to him that you had the discipline,

36:32.924 --> 36:36.201
or the commitment, the will
to sacrifice yourself

36:36.227 --> 36:40.767
for a greater cause, like he did in Vietnam?

36:45.170 --> 36:47.480
Well, it was just a thought.

36:50.675 --> 36:53.485
Maybe you were...

36:53.511 --> 36:56.492
One of those special people who heard--

36:56.514 --> 36:58.960
heard the voice of God tell them...

36:58.983 --> 37:02.089
To join the movement, is that it?

37:02.120 --> 37:03.895
Yes.

37:07.959 --> 37:09.961
It was divine guidance...

37:15.300 --> 37:18.440
Not some base human passion,

37:18.470 --> 37:22.145
like anger... or revenge.

37:23.975 --> 37:26.819
Pride.

37:30.648 --> 37:33.822
It was wounded pride, wasn't it, Dennis?

37:33.852 --> 37:35.593
She defied you,

37:35.620 --> 37:38.624
she killed your unborn child
and it broke you.

37:38.656 --> 37:41.500
- She was weak. It's not her fault.
- Who then?

37:41.526 --> 37:43.563
Nobody held a gun
to her head to go to a clinic--

37:43.595 --> 37:45.404
It's the ones who allowed it!

37:45.430 --> 37:47.706
It's the ones who kept my baby
from being saved!

37:47.732 --> 37:49.939
What is it you told her? That you were angry

37:49.968 --> 37:53.313
at the wrong person all of these years!

37:53.338 --> 37:57.286
It was the doctors! They ripped
that life out of her body.

37:57.308 --> 38:00.255
Is that what you were thinking
when you had Cavella in your scope?

38:00.278 --> 38:04.351
Your baby? The life that might've
been your life with Susan?

38:04.382 --> 38:06.328
I don't think about that anymore.

38:06.351 --> 38:09.696
You think about it all the time.

38:12.957 --> 38:14.959
You've given up hope.

38:16.294 --> 38:18.467
You're giving everything away,

38:21.633 --> 38:24.011
touching base with old friends.

38:25.637 --> 38:27.981
You're closing the book.

38:29.307 --> 38:31.947
You're going to kill yourself.

38:31.976 --> 38:35.048
But not before you pay them back.

38:35.079 --> 38:37.525
- Murderers like Cavella.
- All right, stop this!

38:37.549 --> 38:39.324
I'm telling you, we are through here--

38:39.350 --> 38:43.196
- Pay them back for what they
took away from you!
- He is going to arraignment court!

38:43.221 --> 38:45.861
Pay them back the way your dad taught you!

38:45.890 --> 38:48.336
Come on, Dennis, say it!

38:50.328 --> 38:53.138
You took a life for a life.

38:57.168 --> 38:59.170
( knocking )

39:16.921 --> 39:19.697
His mother put up her house
as bond for the bail.

39:19.724 --> 39:22.432
Soon as the paperwork's done,
he'll be out of our hands.

39:22.460 --> 39:26.306
We'll put surveillance on him and we'll
call Intel to alert the abortion clinics.

39:26.331 --> 39:28.937
I'm thinking he's planning
something closer to home.

39:28.967 --> 39:31.971
- Girlfriend?
- The doctor who performed the abortion.

39:51.656 --> 39:54.227
The surveillance team followed
him to his lawyer's office.

39:54.259 --> 39:56.637
They waited until the lawyer
went home for the night.

39:56.661 --> 39:58.641
They never saw Griscom leave the building.

39:58.663 --> 40:02.042
- Maybe he slipped out through the garage.
- Terrific.

40:07.005 --> 40:09.679
The doctor who did the abortion
passed away two years ago.

40:09.707 --> 40:12.415
I put a trace out on everyone else
involved in the procedure.

40:12.443 --> 40:15.481
This guy has a death wish and he's going
to take somebody down with him.

40:15.513 --> 40:19.518
We can hope he gets the order
mixed up and shoots himself first.

40:23.855 --> 40:27.234
- I need to run Griscom's name through Westlaw.
- Deakins: Go ahead.

40:30.695 --> 40:32.834
What're you looking for?

40:32.864 --> 40:36.175
He said it's the ones who allowed it,

40:36.200 --> 40:39.704
the ones who kept his baby from being saved.

40:41.039 --> 40:42.950
Here we go.

40:42.974 --> 40:46.649
"Dennis Griscom in Re: An Unborn Child."

40:46.678 --> 40:48.351
He sued on behalf of his unborn kid

40:48.379 --> 40:50.689
to stop Susan Ward from having the abortion.

40:50.715 --> 40:53.195
- The judge turned him down.
- Judge Adam Yates.

40:53.217 --> 40:55.561
You find him, you find the gun.

40:57.188 --> 40:59.691
Man: How you doing, Judge? Good to see you.

41:40.431 --> 41:42.308
(gun clicks)

41:50.908 --> 41:52.216
(gun clicks)

41:54.379 --> 41:56.518
Might help if you had a firing pin.

41:56.547 --> 41:58.049
Drop the gun, Dennis!

42:01.486 --> 42:03.966
- Stay away from me.
- Get off the ledge, Dennis.

42:03.988 --> 42:05.296
Don't come near me!

42:05.323 --> 42:07.325
Why do you want to hurt yourself?

42:08.326 --> 42:10.465
- Just tell me why.
- I don't answer to you!

42:10.495 --> 42:11.974
I know.

42:11.996 --> 42:14.340
What about your mother,
and Lori and her kids?

42:14.365 --> 42:17.312
- They're going to want to know.
- ( panting )

42:30.014 --> 42:32.187
It looks like it's going to rain tonight.

42:33.151 --> 42:35.392
- What?
- Goren: Yeah.

42:35.420 --> 42:38.799
It looks like we're going to get
a good soaking. What do you think?

42:41.025 --> 42:42.629
I don't know.

42:42.660 --> 42:45.140
I saw some lighting

42:45.163 --> 42:47.143
from over the park.

42:48.699 --> 42:50.701
Can you see anything?

42:58.876 --> 43:01.083
Come on, Dennis, let's go inside.

43:10.788 --> 43:11.994
- Cuff him.
- Grab him.

43:12.023 --> 43:13.730
I got him.

43:13.758 --> 43:16.500
- Let's go.
- All right, get him up.

43:18.663 --> 43:20.609
Tell the judge we're all clear.

43:23.167 --> 43:24.976
Until the next one.

43:36.714 --> 43:38.819
( theme music playing )
