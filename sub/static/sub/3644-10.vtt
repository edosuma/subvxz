00:05.117 --> 00:08.185
<i>In Los Angeles, lives a
girl named Kirsten Clark.</i>

00:08.210 --> 00:10.244
<i>Kirsten has a very particular gift.</i>

00:10.278 --> 00:14.314
Cameron: <i>That gift is more of a
curse. Kirsten has no sense of time.</i>

00:14.339 --> 00:15.806
Are those brains?

00:15.831 --> 00:18.499
Camille: <i>Or humor. Basically,
the worst roommate ever.</i>

00:18.534 --> 00:20.840
Linus: <i>Because of her condition,
Kirsten lives in a state</i>

00:20.865 --> 00:22.403
<i>of perpetual déjà vu.</i>

00:22.438 --> 00:24.600
Maggie: <i>One day, Kirsten
met a woman named Maggie,</i>

00:24.625 --> 00:27.679
<i>who recruited her for a
secret government program.</i>

00:27.704 --> 00:30.372
<i>We do something there called stitching.</i>

00:30.397 --> 00:33.914
<i>We take a living consciousness and
shove it into someone else's brain.</i>

00:33.939 --> 00:36.429
Linus: <i>A dead someone else's dead brain.</i>

00:36.454 --> 00:38.778
Cameron: <i>Once inside, we
hack the person's memories</i>

00:38.803 --> 00:40.606
<i>to learn how he or she died,</i>

00:40.631 --> 00:42.832
<i>- and it's always pretty horrible.</i>
- (Screaming)

00:42.870 --> 00:44.884
Maggie: <i>We give the dead back their voice,</i>

00:44.909 --> 00:48.440
<i>and in the process, we solve
some very serious crimes.</i>

00:48.465 --> 00:50.633
<i>Kirsten's the perfect stitcher.</i>

00:50.658 --> 00:53.553
Cameron: <i>But she's got a ton of
dark secrets from her own past,</i>

00:53.578 --> 00:55.817
<i>many of which she doesn't even know.</i>

00:55.842 --> 00:57.843
Linus: <i>Which is actually kind of ironic...</i>

00:57.869 --> 01:00.938
Camille: <i>Because for a girl who
lives in the memories of the dead...</i>

01:00.963 --> 01:05.800
Cameron: <i>Kirsten sure has a lot of ghosts.</i>

01:06.440 --> 01:10.056
<i>(Wolf howling)</i>

01:20.033 --> 01:22.430
Camille?

01:42.819 --> 01:46.258
New boyfriend, Camille? Nice try.

01:46.283 --> 01:49.314
Unbelievable.

01:49.339 --> 01:53.051
I thought plunging you into total darkness
would put you over the top this time.

01:53.076 --> 01:55.294
I told you. I don't do scared.

01:55.319 --> 01:57.994
- You let me down, Zed.
- (Beeps)

01:58.019 --> 02:00.455
(Powers down)

02:03.065 --> 02:05.617
(Sighs)

02:05.642 --> 02:09.102
Oh, God. I can't wait till this
place gets back to normal.

02:09.127 --> 02:13.173
You mean boring. Seriously,
you investigate murders

02:13.198 --> 02:15.854
by poking around the
memories of dead people.

02:15.879 --> 02:19.194
How can you not love Halloween?

02:19.939 --> 02:21.870
That reminds me. I'm hungry.

02:21.895 --> 02:23.745
You're gonna be the life
of my Halloween party.

02:23.770 --> 02:25.258
At least you invited me this year.

02:25.283 --> 02:27.184
I didn't like you last year.

02:27.219 --> 02:30.147
(Knock on door)

02:30.172 --> 02:32.770
What? Not me.

02:34.623 --> 02:37.068
(Cackling)

02:37.093 --> 02:41.172
Huh? What do you think?

02:41.196 --> 02:43.596
Dead on. Am I right?

02:43.621 --> 02:44.851
You're two days early.

02:44.876 --> 02:46.787
I'm just trying stuff out.

02:46.812 --> 02:49.195
A cow? Really?

02:49.220 --> 02:50.731
These babies work.

02:51.535 --> 02:54.899
- Give 'em a yank.
- Now, that's scary.

03:04.335 --> 03:06.955
You will find another place for your party.

03:06.980 --> 03:09.581
Well, you know, I was
actually kind of thinking...

03:09.606 --> 03:11.073
No, you can't use our house.

03:11.098 --> 03:12.397
Yeah, you're right. It's too small.

03:12.422 --> 03:13.716
It's not scary enough, even with you in it.

03:13.741 --> 03:15.386
Who left this in the break room?

03:15.411 --> 03:16.978
- That would be me.
- Breakfast of champions?

03:17.003 --> 03:19.304
- Hardly.
- What do you have against corn?

03:19.329 --> 03:22.045
Corn on the cob? Nothing.
Corn tortillas? Bring it.

03:22.069 --> 03:24.823
Popcorn, corn chowder, corn
muffins? I'm all over that.

03:24.848 --> 03:28.344
But pretend corn trying to be corn? Pass.

03:28.511 --> 03:31.604
Read the first ingredient.

03:31.629 --> 03:34.519
- "Corn syrup."
- Thank you.

03:34.544 --> 03:37.247
- So, what are you going to do?
- I don't know.

03:37.272 --> 03:40.302
Camille lost the venue for her
big Halloween bash tomorrow night.

03:40.327 --> 03:41.746
"Nightmare on Camille street"?

03:41.771 --> 03:44.547
Yeah, you know the big spooky
house I always use on Coronado?

03:44.572 --> 03:48.269
Well, it's being torn down to make
way for, ironically, a mortuary.

03:48.293 --> 03:53.141
<i>- (Alarm blaring)</i>
- Speaking of irony, a new sample.

03:55.566 --> 03:59.555
Devon Landry. Age 20. A
student at Archer University.

03:59.580 --> 04:02.395
He was found hanging from a
tree near his home. Suicide.

04:02.420 --> 04:04.605
He left behind a note saying
he was sorry for what he did.

04:04.629 --> 04:05.659
Which was?

04:05.660 --> 04:09.916
We think that he's connected to
the disappearance of Kelli Marino.

04:09.941 --> 04:12.616
She was a student at Archer University

04:12.641 --> 04:14.834
and worked at a diner near campus.

04:14.859 --> 04:16.392
Went missing two days ago.

04:16.418 --> 04:17.880
Oh, I saw that on the news.

04:17.906 --> 04:19.759
She and Devon shared
several classes together,

04:19.784 --> 04:21.789
and given his remorseful suicide note...

04:21.814 --> 04:24.109
- He may have abducted her?
- Or worse.

04:24.134 --> 04:26.501
Maggie: The police have
already searched Devon's house.

04:26.526 --> 04:29.307
He's been living alone since
his parents died a few years ago.

04:29.332 --> 04:31.069
Because that's not creepy at all.

04:31.094 --> 04:34.212
We need to find out if he is
responsible for Kelli's disappearance,

04:34.237 --> 04:37.861
and with any luck, where
we can find her, alive.

04:37.886 --> 04:41.021
Missing girl, possibly murdered.

04:41.046 --> 04:43.282
Happy Halloween.

I'm at a diner.

05:38.535 --> 05:40.435
Devon's watching Kelli.

05:40.460 --> 05:42.998
Just watching her?

05:44.502 --> 05:45.769
Would you like anything else?

05:45.794 --> 05:49.187
No, no, I'm good.

05:49.212 --> 05:51.740
Just get me when you're ready.

05:51.765 --> 05:57.027
Hey, that, uh, that lab test

05:57.052 --> 05:58.782
the other day was pretty hard, huh?

05:58.807 --> 06:02.409
I think he likes her, but he's
kind of awkward around her.

06:02.434 --> 06:04.874
Cameron, you can relate to that.

06:04.899 --> 06:07.471
(Mock laughs)

06:08.557 --> 06:12.529
- We're in the same class.
- Oh, we are?

06:12.554 --> 06:16.074
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that lab was killer.

06:16.099 --> 06:20.376
Yeah, I... (Clears throat)

06:26.469 --> 06:29.237
Oh, here.

06:29.262 --> 06:32.762
Okay, then.

06:35.678 --> 06:39.799
- Have a nice day.
- Yeah, you too.

06:44.638 --> 06:48.568
I'm not sure where I am now,

06:48.593 --> 06:50.528
but Devon's with a dead body.

06:50.553 --> 06:51.982
Oh, God!

06:52.492 --> 06:54.864
Is it Kelli?

07:01.261 --> 07:03.951
I don't know. I'm someplace else.

07:05.059 --> 07:09.551
I... I think it's Devon's bedroom.

07:10.603 --> 07:14.239
Why do you do bad things?

07:14.264 --> 07:16.299
He's talking to himself.

07:16.324 --> 07:18.183
You need to stop.

07:18.208 --> 07:20.671
Just leave her alone.

07:22.500 --> 07:24.893
I'm ping ponging all over the place.

07:24.919 --> 07:27.678
I'm back at the diner.

07:30.599 --> 07:32.805
Kelli's locking up.

07:36.048 --> 07:39.887
- Devon's watching her again.
- Is there anyone else around?

07:39.912 --> 07:41.935
- Any witnesses?
- No.

07:43.163 --> 07:47.230
Don't you try and stop me!

07:49.211 --> 07:52.503
(Screaming)

07:52.528 --> 07:54.671
I'm bouncing!

07:57.046 --> 07:58.250
_

07:58.275 --> 08:01.747
You still had time. Why did you bounce?

08:02.703 --> 08:04.965
Devon looked at me and talked to me.

08:04.990 --> 08:06.475
Wait a second.

08:06.501 --> 08:09.623
That dead guy talked to you, in his memory?

08:09.648 --> 08:12.376
Yeah, yeah, he said that I
shouldn't try to stop him.

08:12.401 --> 08:13.467
And then, he grabbed Kelli.

08:13.492 --> 08:17.040
Everyone who's freaked out, say "me." Me!

08:17.065 --> 08:18.939
It was a phantasmic memory anomaly.

08:18.964 --> 08:20.783
Yes, it's a PMA. Of course.

08:20.808 --> 08:22.783
Now, in "human," please.

08:22.808 --> 08:24.839
A phantom memory. A distortion.

08:24.864 --> 08:26.452
What you saw didn't really happen.

08:26.477 --> 08:28.578
He was thinking that thought,
and then, in his mind,

08:28.603 --> 08:30.587
it got encoded as a
direct comment to himself.

08:30.612 --> 08:32.582
Cameron: But it appears as if you saw him.

08:32.607 --> 08:33.677
Maybe.

08:33.678 --> 08:36.280
Okay, focus, people. You
said that he grabbed her.

08:36.306 --> 08:37.833
Could you tell if he killed her?

08:37.859 --> 08:40.061
(Sighs) No.

08:40.086 --> 08:42.821
- The body you saw in the room?
- I don't know if it was Kelli's.

08:42.846 --> 08:44.406
I couldn't even tell where it was.

08:44.431 --> 08:45.507
Devon's house?

08:45.531 --> 08:47.414
The police were all over that.
They didn't find anything.

08:47.615 --> 08:48.919
Well, maybe they missed something.

08:48.944 --> 08:51.802
I'll call Fisher and get a copy of
the report from the first responders.

08:51.827 --> 08:55.295
In the meantime, go check it out.

09:05.165 --> 09:08.636
- Linus: Wow!
- Holy crapenstein.

09:08.661 --> 09:10.896
Cameron: Talk about your good,
old-fashioned nightmare fuel.

09:10.921 --> 09:13.790
Talk about the perfect
place for my Halloween party.

09:13.815 --> 09:15.749
Oh, seriously? We have a job to do.

09:15.774 --> 09:17.641
As do I. Look, according to public records,

09:17.666 --> 09:20.817
the place is completely paid
off and freshly ownerless.

09:20.842 --> 09:22.576
As soon as Devon's death becomes public,

09:22.601 --> 09:24.419
the whole kit and kaboodle
will be grabbed up by the state.

09:24.444 --> 09:27.275
- Okay, so?
- So, it's available.

09:27.300 --> 09:30.896
Cameron: A girl is missing. You can't
throw a party where her kidnapper lived.

09:30.921 --> 09:33.623
- Because?
- Because it's wrong on every level.

09:33.648 --> 09:36.225
I think there's a gray area
where it's a wee bit right.

09:36.250 --> 09:38.256
All right. Does anything you see out
here, match what you saw in the stitch?

09:38.281 --> 09:39.792
No.

09:43.445 --> 09:46.356
Um, there's someone in the house.

09:46.505 --> 09:48.770
I didn't see anything.

09:48.795 --> 09:50.404
I did.

10:00.123 --> 10:02.470
Hello?

10:05.796 --> 10:09.466
Did it strike anyone else as
odd that the door was unlocked?

10:09.491 --> 10:10.819
Should we be worried?

10:10.844 --> 10:12.407
Answer the second question first.

10:12.432 --> 10:14.100
Kirsten, the cops already
searched the place.

10:14.125 --> 10:16.431
I saw someone upstairs.

10:16.456 --> 10:18.947
And she's going upstairs.

10:19.830 --> 10:21.705
Bro, this place give you the creeps?

10:21.730 --> 10:23.576
Yeah, it would creep me out
even if it wasn't the domain

10:23.601 --> 10:26.474
of a kidnapper and possible killer.

10:35.758 --> 10:37.769
Hello?

10:49.230 --> 10:51.397
Hello?

10:51.456 --> 10:54.594
Okay, the punch bowl goes there.
Zed the zombie's out there...

10:54.619 --> 10:56.626
Still wrong. Check the basement.

10:56.650 --> 10:57.984
- For what?
- Bodies.

10:58.009 --> 11:00.043
Why don't you go check out the basement?

11:00.068 --> 11:02.643
Yeah, why don't you go check
out what is probably the most

11:02.647 --> 11:04.028
awful basement in the universe?

11:04.029 --> 11:07.473
I would, but...

11:07.497 --> 11:09.461
I've gotta go upstairs.

11:16.487 --> 11:19.255
This is so perfect.

11:36.742 --> 11:38.609
I thought I saw someone.

11:38.634 --> 11:42.266
- It was just the curtain.
- Yeah, I guess.

11:42.291 --> 11:44.339
You coming?

11:44.919 --> 11:46.601
Do you feel that?

11:46.626 --> 11:48.032
Feel what?

11:48.057 --> 11:51.626
Like a... presence.

11:51.651 --> 11:54.499
Wh-what kind of presence?

11:54.684 --> 11:56.786
The watching kind.

11:56.811 --> 11:58.954
So, I checked downstairs.

11:58.979 --> 12:03.470
There was nobody there. Get it? "No body."

12:03.848 --> 12:06.639
Come on, these are the jokes, people.

12:06.664 --> 12:07.798
No one's up here.

12:07.823 --> 12:09.430
So, the house is empty.

12:10.964 --> 12:12.669
She doesn't look convinced.

12:12.694 --> 12:15.685
She feels a presence.

12:15.710 --> 12:17.444
I thought you don't do scared.

12:17.469 --> 12:19.870
I don't. I'm doing intrigued.

12:19.895 --> 12:22.856
And on that note...

12:58.448 --> 13:01.471
I don't get it. Devon's online profile.

13:01.495 --> 13:03.278
He doesn't seem like a killer.

13:03.279 --> 13:05.307
He did well in school.
He never got in trouble.

13:05.308 --> 13:09.092
He kept to himself,
doesn't have many friends.

13:09.117 --> 13:10.947
Sounds like a leggy blonde I know.

13:10.971 --> 13:12.386
Care for an "eye d'oeuvre"?

13:12.387 --> 13:14.791
- Eye d'oeuvre?
- Yeah, they're for the party.

13:14.816 --> 13:16.825
It's mozzarella, a little black olive,

13:16.860 --> 13:20.455
and a touch of food coloring
for that creepy, bloodshot look.

13:20.480 --> 13:22.764
Are you seriously going
ahead with the party?

13:22.797 --> 13:26.743
Uh, funny story. I may have accidentally

13:26.770 --> 13:28.637
told a couple of people
about finding Devon's house,

13:28.672 --> 13:30.036
and then, one of them

13:30.061 --> 13:33.936
may have group chatted the address.

13:33.961 --> 13:35.939
Come on, it'll be fine.
It's just one night.

13:35.964 --> 13:39.100
And besides, the whole place is
in limbo until the state claims it.

13:39.134 --> 13:41.945
What's the worst that could happen?

13:41.970 --> 13:44.939
Hi, Linus. Did you know that
Camille's going ahead with the party?

13:44.973 --> 13:48.009
Yeah. We're actually heading out right now
to pick up some more Halloween decorations.

13:48.034 --> 13:49.231
I know a guy who owns a prop house.

13:49.256 --> 13:51.096
He's letting us borrow a coffin.

13:51.121 --> 13:52.564
Are you seriously going along with this?

13:52.565 --> 13:55.035
Look, I know the whole
house thing's a little weird,

13:55.036 --> 13:56.812
- Yeah.
- but it is a party, right?

13:58.072 --> 14:01.020
- Are these eye d'oeuvres?
- Mm-hmm.

14:01.357 --> 14:04.635
Mmm. Mmm. You got nachos?

14:04.660 --> 14:06.747
I only have eyes for you.

14:06.772 --> 14:09.611
Anyways, we should get going. My
friend said he'll kill me if we're late.

14:09.636 --> 14:12.254
Well, if he does, we can break
in that coffin. Later, roomie.

14:12.279 --> 14:13.880
See ya.

14:17.349 --> 14:21.379
- (Wind rushing)
- (Thunder crashing)

14:49.223 --> 14:52.960
(Creaking)

15:00.519 --> 15:04.463
(Gasps)

15:27.975 --> 15:30.546
Who's there?

15:33.242 --> 15:35.787
(Clattering)

15:50.327 --> 15:53.069
(Panting)

15:55.631 --> 15:58.820
- (Cat screeches)
- (Screams)

16:06.072 --> 16:08.692
(Knocking on door)

16:18.084 --> 16:21.807
I know you have no concept of time, but
do you have any idea what time it is?

16:21.832 --> 16:23.073
Devon was at my house.

16:23.098 --> 16:24.795
- Kirsten...
- No, I'm serious.

16:24.820 --> 16:26.623
He was outside. He was
outside, he was staring at me,

16:26.648 --> 16:29.016
and then he was just...
he was gone like a ghost.

16:29.041 --> 16:30.635
A ghost?

16:30.660 --> 16:34.066
I know. I know. It's
ridiculous. Devon's dead.

16:34.315 --> 16:37.747
Have you got any chocolate hazelnut spread?

16:37.772 --> 16:39.474
Excuse me?

16:39.499 --> 16:43.021
Chocolate hazelnut
spread. It calms me down.

16:49.752 --> 16:52.231
There's a tidbit of information
I never knew about you.

16:52.256 --> 16:54.191
Look, I know there's no
such thing as ghosts, but...

16:54.225 --> 16:56.730
Well, for you, there are, kind of.

16:56.755 --> 17:00.938
When you're in someone's memory, you're
basically looking at images that linger.

17:02.773 --> 17:05.044
But I wasn't in the stitch. I was at home.

17:05.069 --> 17:07.826
Things have a way of
sticking to your subconscious.

17:07.852 --> 17:09.987
Milk.

17:10.167 --> 17:12.146
That calm you down, too?

17:12.172 --> 17:14.339
No. Goes with the chocolate.

17:14.816 --> 17:17.050
Here.

17:17.075 --> 17:20.554
I'll get you a...

17:22.344 --> 17:27.234
Glass. Should I be worried about you?

17:27.723 --> 17:30.866
No. No, I'm fine.

17:31.832 --> 17:33.799
I just need to sleep.

17:33.824 --> 17:37.435
Enjoy the couch. I'll
see you in the morning.

17:43.908 --> 17:46.104
All right, let's get this over with.

17:52.148 --> 17:56.014
Aren't you going to call
a go, no-go for the stitch?

18:14.765 --> 18:19.211
Uh, Cameron, something's wrong.

18:22.797 --> 18:24.696
Cameron.

18:24.721 --> 18:27.356
We're losing water.

18:27.381 --> 18:30.719
Camille, Linus!

18:30.744 --> 18:33.239
Guys, do you see what's happening?

18:33.264 --> 18:35.919
What's going on? Guys.

18:35.944 --> 18:39.693
(Panting)

18:39.718 --> 18:41.526
(Gasping)

18:41.551 --> 18:43.607
(Screams) Cameron!

18:43.632 --> 18:45.599
(Screams) Cameron!

18:45.624 --> 18:48.442
Stop the stitch! Cameron!

18:48.467 --> 18:50.234
No!

18:50.259 --> 18:51.527
No!

18:51.551 --> 18:53.166
Cameron!

18:53.192 --> 18:56.735
Cameron, stop the stitch! Cameron!

18:56.759 --> 18:59.335
(Screaming)

19:02.742 --> 19:05.246
Oh, God.

19:05.271 --> 19:07.849
Cameron, stop the stitch!

19:08.756 --> 19:12.647
- (Thunder clap)
- (Panting)

20:20.964 --> 20:23.766
(Gasps)

20:33.093 --> 20:36.029
Oh!

20:36.054 --> 20:38.560
He's out there. He's out there.

20:38.585 --> 20:42.841
- Who?
- Devon. Look. Look. Come on.

20:43.359 --> 20:47.993
Devon's out there. Don't.

20:51.320 --> 20:54.162
- No one's out here.
- He was. I just saw him.

20:54.187 --> 20:56.882
Okay, how about we put
the knife away, Jason?

20:56.907 --> 20:58.530
I just saw him.

20:58.554 --> 21:01.875
Kirsten, this is just work-induced stress.

21:01.900 --> 21:03.161
But why this case?

21:03.186 --> 21:05.122
Everyone has got their limits.

21:05.147 --> 21:06.649
No, no, I don't.

21:06.674 --> 21:10.734
Okay, just give me... Hand me the knife.

21:10.759 --> 21:12.991
Okay. Oh, my God, you're shaking.

21:13.016 --> 21:17.052
Okay, just take some deep
breaths. Try to relax.

21:17.296 --> 21:20.232
- Okay.
- You don't do scared, remember?

21:20.257 --> 21:22.450
- Okay.
- Okay, you're safe.

21:22.475 --> 21:26.046
You're safe. Devon's dead.
Nothing is going to happen to you.

21:26.071 --> 21:28.806
So, what do you say you go
back to bed and get some sleep?

21:28.831 --> 21:31.186
- Okay.
- Okay.

21:44.426 --> 21:48.215
Okay, you all good?

21:49.556 --> 21:51.791
Okay, I'll see you in the morning.

21:51.816 --> 21:54.392
Wait.

21:55.886 --> 21:58.389
Stay with me?

21:58.778 --> 22:00.862
Sure.

22:42.737 --> 22:45.819
(Cell phone rings)

22:50.731 --> 22:52.699
Hey, Fisher.

22:52.724 --> 22:56.026
<i>Just heard Devon Landry worked
as a temp at Archer's med school</i>

22:56.051 --> 22:57.751
<i>in the cadaver lab.</i>

22:57.776 --> 22:59.566
That's what I get to wake up to?

22:59.591 --> 23:03.207
<i>I'm sorry. Good morning! Sleep well?</i>

23:03.232 --> 23:06.022
<i>Devon Landry worked as a
temp in the cadaver lab.</i>

23:06.047 --> 23:09.918
Much better. It could be why
Kirsten saw a body in the stitch.

23:09.943 --> 23:12.527
<i>Maybe she'll connect with
something that'll lead us to Kelli.</i>

23:12.552 --> 23:15.079
<i>See if you can find
Kirsten and meet me there.</i>

23:15.104 --> 23:19.191
Yeah, I'll see if I can find her.

23:30.556 --> 23:32.036
You okay?

23:32.061 --> 23:33.653
She's a little rattled by this case.

23:33.678 --> 23:36.294
No, I'm not. I didn't
sleep well last night.

23:36.319 --> 23:38.821
- You snore.
- No, I don't.

23:38.846 --> 23:40.668
Are you guys...?

23:40.694 --> 23:43.781
(Laughs) You know what? T.M.I.

23:43.806 --> 23:46.369
- We're not. And, I don't.
- Ok, let's just do this.

23:46.394 --> 23:49.355
- Look familiar?
- Yeah, this kind of does.

23:51.817 --> 23:53.866
- You may want to look away.
- Seriously?

23:53.891 --> 23:55.992
He's right. You don't
know what's under here.

23:56.017 --> 23:57.918
I work with the dead every single day.

23:57.943 --> 24:00.001
Don't say we didn't warn you.

24:00.026 --> 24:01.890
Holy crapenstein.

24:01.915 --> 24:03.761
Ugh. His organs are missing.

24:03.786 --> 24:05.309
Yeah, that's what happens
with medical school cadavers.

24:05.334 --> 24:06.862
- You okay, boys?
- Yup, fine.

24:06.887 --> 24:08.483
Clearly, it isn't Kelli.

24:08.508 --> 24:10.784
Wait. Wait. What's that?

24:10.809 --> 24:13.340
What?

24:16.032 --> 24:19.558
Oh, no, please don't.

24:24.768 --> 24:26.024
Ugh.

24:26.048 --> 24:29.395
Tonight, it's my turn
to have the nightmares.

24:33.545 --> 24:36.138
It's Kelli's phone. I saw it in the stitch.

24:36.163 --> 24:40.587
So, he placed it there for someone
to find, and then, offs himself? Why?

24:40.612 --> 24:42.861
We're not dealing with a rational person.

24:42.886 --> 24:46.751
(Gasps) Oh, my God.

24:48.845 --> 24:51.068
Talk to me, people. I
need to know where Kelli is

24:51.093 --> 24:54.362
and if she's still alive.
Where are Linus and Camille?

24:54.387 --> 24:57.648
Sorry. I'm sorry. Zed's
rotator cuff was all jammed up,

24:57.673 --> 24:58.771
and then, there was Linus' driving, so...

24:58.811 --> 25:00.517
Zed?

25:00.542 --> 25:02.965
We'll explain later. And there's
nothing wrong with my driving.

25:02.990 --> 25:05.619
Yeah, anyway, while Linus was
busy driving like my grandmother,

25:05.644 --> 25:07.678
I ran the photogrammetry on the picture.

25:07.703 --> 25:09.939
- Kelli is in...
- A small room with cement walls.

25:09.964 --> 25:11.765
Yes, but did you notice...

25:11.789 --> 25:13.724
The walls are covered
with plastic? Yeah, we did.

25:13.725 --> 25:17.038
- No windows and the seams are...
- Sealed, so they're airtight.

25:17.063 --> 25:19.724
Let me talk. Thank you so much.

25:19.749 --> 25:22.751
Based on Kelli and
Devon's height and weight

25:22.776 --> 25:24.810
and per the visibility and
spectral analysis I ran,

25:24.835 --> 25:27.120
Kelli is in a space that
is 7 by 8 by 10 feet.

25:27.145 --> 25:30.514
- When was the selfie taken?
- Her phone said 6:13 A.M., two days ago.

25:30.539 --> 25:35.202
So, she's been sealed for
54 hours and 47 minutes.

25:35.227 --> 25:37.328
So, doing the math, if
Kelli is still alive,

25:37.353 --> 25:40.563
carbon dioxide will kill
her in approximately...

25:40.588 --> 25:42.667
124 minutes.

25:48.555 --> 25:51.607
Kelly doesn't have much time.
Where was that picture taken?

25:51.641 --> 25:53.933
The geotag location function
on her phone was disabled.

25:53.957 --> 25:55.535
It could have been anywhere.

25:55.536 --> 25:57.384
- Could it have been in Australia?
- What?

25:57.409 --> 25:58.924
Of course not. What's your point?

25:58.949 --> 26:00.916
My point is that it can't be anywhere.

26:00.951 --> 26:03.864
It has to be somewhere within
certain geographic parameters.

26:03.889 --> 26:07.432
Did you guys know that the term
"selfie" was invented by an Australian?

26:07.457 --> 26:11.376
And did you know that the term "who cares?"
was invented to describe this conversation?

26:11.401 --> 26:13.820
Quiet. Time of death on Devon was 9:00 A.M.

26:13.845 --> 26:16.285
That's 2 hours and 47 minutes

26:16.310 --> 26:17.859
after he took the selfie with Kelli.

26:17.884 --> 26:19.379
We know he went to a cadaver lab

26:19.413 --> 26:21.147
because he left her phone in a cadaver.

26:21.182 --> 26:24.014
Okay, so let's say he spent no
more than ten minutes at the morgue,

26:24.039 --> 26:25.769
and it takes another ten minutes

26:25.794 --> 26:26.983
to get to and from the office in his car.

26:27.008 --> 26:29.298
How close is the lab to his house?

26:29.323 --> 26:32.026
At that time of day, the drive
home took Devon 33 minutes.

26:32.051 --> 26:34.165
Let's give him another six minutes
to write the suicide letter,

26:34.190 --> 26:37.026
twenty minutes to rig the ropes
and find just the right tree.

26:37.051 --> 26:39.208
That leaves 88 minutes of
Devon's time unaccounted for,

26:39.233 --> 26:42.943
which means Kelli is no further than
that in any direction from his house.

26:42.968 --> 26:44.848
We don't have time to run a grid search.

26:44.873 --> 26:47.656
But we do have time to stitch.

26:51.658 --> 26:55.075
- We need to talk.
- No, we need to stitch, now.

26:55.100 --> 26:56.801
That's what we need to talk about.

26:56.826 --> 26:59.027
Are you sure that you're
emotionally ready for this?

26:59.052 --> 27:01.242
Cameron told you I'm seeing things.

27:01.267 --> 27:03.787
Devon's ghost, to be exact.

27:03.812 --> 27:06.189
Tell the whole world, why don't you?

27:07.046 --> 27:10.815
- Linus?
- There's 97 minutes of air left.

27:10.840 --> 27:13.722
So, we can talk or we
can save Kelli. Your call.

27:16.302 --> 27:18.017
Cameron, let 'er rip.

27:18.042 --> 27:20.463
- Com check, Kirsten.
- I'm with you.

27:20.488 --> 27:22.762
Okay, Kelli. Come out,
come out, wherever you are.

27:22.787 --> 27:24.702
Induce stitch neurosync on my mark,

27:24.727 --> 27:28.498
in three, two, one, mark.

27:31.344 --> 27:34.988
(Speaking slowly) I'm in Devon's house.

27:40.188 --> 27:43.842
He hears something downstairs.

27:48.441 --> 27:50.195
I'm in the basement.

27:50.220 --> 27:52.043
Ok. What's Devon doing?

27:52.067 --> 27:54.145
I don't see him.

28:01.600 --> 28:05.398
- I see him now.
- (Muffled screaming)

28:06.820 --> 28:12.254
I can hear Kelli screaming,
but I don't know where she...

28:14.924 --> 28:18.734
You're next.

28:19.511 --> 28:21.574
I'm bouncing.

28:22.687 --> 28:25.175
Call Fisher. Kelli's in the basement.

28:36.465 --> 28:39.731
Help me. She's behind here.

28:51.738 --> 28:53.559
Kirsten: Kelli.

28:54.560 --> 28:57.503
- Is she...?
- Still breathing.

28:57.528 --> 28:59.471
Kelli, wake up.

29:00.571 --> 29:02.958
Kelli, wake up.

29:06.685 --> 29:10.216
- Okay.
- Please stay with us.

29:10.241 --> 29:13.862
Kelli, please, open your
eyes, open your eyes.

29:13.887 --> 29:15.701
Open your eyes.

29:18.266 --> 29:20.841
Kelli, Kelli.

29:20.866 --> 29:24.536
- (Coughs)
- It's okay. We're here to save you.

29:24.711 --> 29:27.379
It's okay.

29:27.404 --> 29:29.043
Who are you?

29:29.068 --> 29:31.540
I'm Kirsten. You're safe now.

29:31.565 --> 29:33.639
- (Crying)
- It's okay.

29:33.664 --> 29:37.599
It's okay. You're safe now.

29:37.624 --> 29:40.470
Okay.

29:54.533 --> 29:55.937
Kelli's dehydrated.

29:55.961 --> 29:57.303
A couple minor scrapes and bruises,

29:57.304 --> 29:58.844
but she's going to be okay.

29:58.869 --> 29:59.891
Physically.

30:00.176 --> 30:02.576
Victim services is gonna
meet her at the hospital.

30:02.601 --> 30:04.776
Do you need our statements about
Devon Landry kidnapping her?

30:04.802 --> 30:07.593
Uh, let's keep you guys off the grid.

30:07.618 --> 30:11.763
If it weren't for you, she
would've died. You saved her life.

30:11.788 --> 30:14.361
It's basically what we do for a living.

30:17.495 --> 30:19.413
Well done.

30:19.438 --> 30:21.573
Maybe now that we've
put Devon's ghost to bed,

30:21.598 --> 30:22.798
you can get a decent night's sleep.

30:22.823 --> 30:24.593
Yeah.

30:24.618 --> 30:27.353
- Well, I guess we should all go home.
- Camille: Why?

30:27.378 --> 30:30.480
It is Halloween.

30:30.505 --> 30:31.814
(Makes ghostly noise)

30:31.839 --> 30:35.918
Come on. I got stuff to do. Let's go.

30:38.055 --> 30:40.885
(Groaning)

30:40.910 --> 30:44.398
<i>(Dance music playing)</i>

31:07.882 --> 31:10.798
How did you pull this off in one day?

31:10.823 --> 31:13.013
I know people, baby. I
just made a few calls.

31:13.038 --> 31:15.122
This party is epic.

31:15.147 --> 31:17.320
Yeah, and also highly inappropriate.

31:17.345 --> 31:20.195
Oh, shut up and drink
your morgue-arita already.

31:20.220 --> 31:21.621
Everyone is having a blast.

31:21.646 --> 31:24.232
Did you guys know that Halloween
started as a Gaelic celebration

31:24.257 --> 31:25.731
at the end of the harvest season?

31:25.756 --> 31:29.017
No one likes a know-it-all, Linus.
What are you even supposed to be?

31:29.042 --> 31:32.475
I'm an intergalactic rock star.

31:32.500 --> 31:34.556
It looks like your
mother did your make-up.

31:34.580 --> 31:35.753
Your point?

31:35.754 --> 31:39.481
Anyway, Halloween is about a lot of things,

31:39.507 --> 31:42.576
but tonight, it's about not
letting your fears get to you.

31:42.601 --> 31:45.394
Scantily-clad vampire
space princess is right.

31:45.419 --> 31:48.100
It's just "vampire space princess."

31:48.125 --> 31:50.880
Let's make some magic happen at this party.

31:51.434 --> 31:53.635
Ah!

31:54.008 --> 31:58.639
Oh, my God. A pregnant zombie!
That is so oddly intriguing.

31:58.663 --> 32:01.080
Let's go get our picture with her.

32:03.025 --> 32:06.131
You've got pixie dust on you.

32:06.156 --> 32:08.721
- And to my eye. Great.
- Wait. I...

32:08.746 --> 32:11.159
(Blows)

32:11.581 --> 32:13.954
You look like an angel.

32:13.979 --> 32:16.456
You look like a hero.

32:17.134 --> 32:20.496
No, but, seriously, thank you for helping
me through the last couple of days.

32:20.521 --> 32:23.623
Well, that's what heroes do.
Then again, you would know.

32:23.648 --> 32:25.201
Kelli is alive because of you.

32:25.226 --> 32:27.538
- Because of us.
- Okay, fine.

32:27.744 --> 32:30.344
We should start a crime-fighting team.

32:30.369 --> 32:31.586
Excellent idea.

32:31.611 --> 32:34.049
Okay, well, what should
our superhero names be?

32:34.074 --> 32:37.640
You could be Captain Big Hair.

32:37.665 --> 32:38.776
Really?

32:39.199 --> 32:41.784
Making the world safe for mousses and gels,

32:41.809 --> 32:44.346
it's Captain Big Hair!

32:44.371 --> 32:47.816
Okay, fine. You can be Deathstare.

32:47.841 --> 32:51.844
Deathstare? Seriously? Like,
that's my superhero name?

32:51.869 --> 32:54.335
There it is.

32:55.982 --> 32:59.536
You, um... You wanna dance?

32:59.561 --> 33:01.362
Sure.

33:01.387 --> 33:03.143
Just let me get the
pixie dust out of my eyes.

33:03.168 --> 33:05.220
But the line for the bathroom's nuts.

33:05.245 --> 33:07.862
Yeah, I think I saw one upstairs.

33:08.021 --> 33:10.873
I'll be waiting for that dance.

33:23.878 --> 33:26.259
Hello?

33:43.418 --> 33:47.114
Why do you do bad things?

33:49.122 --> 33:51.946
Where's the mirror?

33:54.111 --> 33:56.801
(Glass cracks)

33:59.929 --> 34:02.881
(Gasps)

34:14.103 --> 34:16.552
Get off of me! Let go!

34:16.553 --> 34:18.777
Why are you here?

34:18.802 --> 34:21.358
Why did you bring these people to my house?

34:24.091 --> 34:26.501
Don't you try and stop me.

34:26.784 --> 34:28.752
Why do you do bad things?

34:28.777 --> 34:31.065
You're my ghost.

34:31.090 --> 34:34.344
No, I'm your nightmare.

34:45.536 --> 34:46.728
Cameron!

34:46.924 --> 34:47.967
Cameron!

34:49.882 --> 34:52.945
Where's Kirsten already? I
got her a monster mash-tini.

34:52.967 --> 34:54.864
- Seriously, who comes up with these names?
- I did.

34:54.937 --> 34:57.348
Space princess doesn't think
I have Halloween spirit.

34:57.373 --> 35:01.631
The space princess doesn't
like the space rock star.

35:01.856 --> 35:05.461
Okay, I'm a space
princess, but I have fangs.

35:05.486 --> 35:10.487
You're not scary. Neither of
you are embracing the essence

35:10.512 --> 35:13.269
of what makes Halloween so awesome.

35:13.294 --> 35:15.673
There's an evil twin
upstairs in a secret room!

35:15.698 --> 35:17.732
(Music stops)

35:18.747 --> 35:22.142
Ha! That's what I'm talking about!

35:22.183 --> 35:24.749
- (Music resumes)
- (People cheer)

35:25.358 --> 35:28.560
No, I'm not kidding.

35:28.585 --> 35:30.881
- Devon has a twin brother. He's here.
- What?

35:30.906 --> 35:33.741
He's the one that kidnapped
Kelli and killed Devon.

35:34.389 --> 35:37.612
We have to clear everybody out. Clear
everyone out right now. Right now.

35:37.637 --> 35:41.068
Excuse me. Excuse me. Ok.
Everybody out! The party's over.

35:41.093 --> 35:42.547
Seriously, party's over!

35:42.572 --> 35:45.804
Oh, for the love of... Excuse me.

35:46.472 --> 35:51.143
You guys, Stephen King's outside
and he's signing autographs!

35:51.168 --> 35:53.660
Go ahead. Don't miss it.

35:56.605 --> 36:00.069
We'll see you next year. It was fantastic.

36:04.506 --> 36:07.441
- Okay, Fisher's on his way.
- Okay, good.

36:07.783 --> 36:10.211
- Where's Camille?
- I didn't see her leave.

36:10.236 --> 36:12.006
Me neither.

36:12.030 --> 36:15.076
- Damn it.
- Camille?

36:15.101 --> 36:18.247
- Camille!
- (Camille shouting)

36:20.700 --> 36:23.328
Cameron: Kirsten, wait!

36:25.143 --> 36:27.221
Camille!

36:27.246 --> 36:29.113
Phones!

36:29.138 --> 36:31.279
(Camille screaming)

36:42.899 --> 36:45.611
This wasn't here before.

36:49.106 --> 36:51.177
Kirsten!

36:52.787 --> 36:55.488
- Cameron: Kirsten!
- (Gasps)

36:55.796 --> 36:58.022
- Where is he?
- He said he was looking for you.

36:58.047 --> 36:59.799
Cameron: Kirsten!

37:09.426 --> 37:13.014
I said I was going to get
her, not go look for her.

37:13.039 --> 37:15.141
Okay, the police are coming.

37:15.548 --> 37:17.265
Just let us go.

37:17.290 --> 37:19.604
- Come on!
- I'm trying!

37:19.628 --> 37:21.323
No, pull up!

37:21.348 --> 37:23.676
- Cameron: Kirsten!
- You know, they can't get in here.

37:23.701 --> 37:25.880
You don't have to do this.

37:25.905 --> 37:27.603
This isn't my fault.

37:29.639 --> 37:33.078
It's Devon. It's always been Devon.

37:33.103 --> 37:36.230
Everybody's favorite.

37:36.255 --> 37:38.004
Is that why you killed him?

37:38.029 --> 37:39.964
He wanted me to let her go.

37:39.989 --> 37:41.796
Kelli?

37:42.261 --> 37:44.262
Yeah.

37:46.709 --> 37:49.328
He liked her.

37:49.562 --> 37:51.463
I had to get her away from him.

37:51.488 --> 37:52.630
Push it up!

37:53.089 --> 37:55.852
- Kirsten, we're coming!
- Camille!

37:55.877 --> 37:58.912
You know, when I'm through with you,

37:58.937 --> 38:01.373
your boyfriend's next.

38:01.398 --> 38:04.213
It was you, wasn't it? It
was you outside my window,

38:04.238 --> 38:07.714
and you in the hallway,
not Devon. You followed me.

38:07.739 --> 38:09.709
Yeah,

38:09.734 --> 38:13.339
there's something different about you.

38:13.364 --> 38:15.411
There's something not right.

38:15.436 --> 38:17.055
I swear, he didn't get that from me.

38:17.080 --> 38:19.982
Quiet. No, you're right.

38:20.007 --> 38:23.563
You're right. There is
something off about me.

38:23.588 --> 38:25.260
I'm just like you.

38:25.284 --> 38:28.676
No, see, you're not like me.

38:28.701 --> 38:30.736
Okay? Nobody is.

38:30.761 --> 38:34.264
I know. It's not easy being different.

38:34.289 --> 38:35.723
Trust me, I know.

38:35.747 --> 38:37.662
When you're different,

38:37.687 --> 38:41.470
people, they... they look
at you strange, right?

38:41.495 --> 38:45.966
People treat you... treat you
like you're... like you're a freak.

38:46.699 --> 38:49.952
That's what happened
to me when I was a kid.

38:49.977 --> 38:52.980
No one wanted to be around
me, not even my parents.

38:53.005 --> 38:55.558
Devon was supposed to be with me.

38:55.583 --> 38:57.978
Then, he went off with her.

38:58.003 --> 39:00.917
I know. He deserved to be punished.

39:01.458 --> 39:05.094
They both did, because
Devon, he betrayed you.

39:05.119 --> 39:07.867
Right? I get that.

39:07.892 --> 39:10.556
I do. I don't know what I would have done

39:10.581 --> 39:13.846
if I had a twin that everybody
thought was special and good.

39:13.871 --> 39:15.986
The twin that got to be out in the sun

39:16.011 --> 39:18.077
while I was kept hidden away.

39:19.744 --> 39:23.614
I get you, I get you,

39:23.639 --> 39:25.791
because I am just like you...

39:26.461 --> 39:29.860
In every way except one.

39:31.398 --> 39:34.381
I am nothing like you.

39:40.950 --> 39:43.546
Holy crapenstein.

39:52.573 --> 39:55.288
Well, the good news is
you weren't seeing a ghost.

39:55.313 --> 39:57.072
Kirsten: Yeah, bad news?

39:57.097 --> 40:01.000
We need to get some sort of
twin alert in the stitch lab.

40:01.025 --> 40:03.660
A phantasmic memory anomaly? Really?

40:03.685 --> 40:05.657
Sounds better than "evil twin."

40:05.682 --> 40:07.815
Or not.

40:07.840 --> 40:11.232
His name's Gavin. And I don't know how,

40:11.257 --> 40:13.408
but his existence was
completely off the record.

40:13.434 --> 40:15.506
Some parents don't deal
well with different.

40:15.531 --> 40:17.960
Yeah, real different.

40:17.985 --> 40:20.689
At least we cleared Devon's
name. It's all good now.

40:20.714 --> 40:22.444
Actually, it's not.

40:22.469 --> 40:24.939
Trespassing, breaking and entering,

40:24.964 --> 40:26.937
all for a Halloween party.

40:26.962 --> 40:28.926
An epic Halloween party.

40:28.951 --> 40:33.496
Thank you, weird space alien rocker?

40:33.521 --> 40:36.892
Thank you. See?

40:36.917 --> 40:38.708
Are you gonna arrest us?

40:39.604 --> 40:41.582
Only if you don't invite me next year.

40:41.607 --> 40:43.347
Oh!

40:43.722 --> 40:45.565
Later.

40:45.590 --> 40:48.921
Well, this was definitely
the scariest Halloween ever.

40:48.947 --> 40:52.275
I told you, I don't do scared.

40:57.690 --> 41:01.109
(Groaning)
