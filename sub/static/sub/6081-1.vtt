01:14.161 --> 01:15.869
Be seated.

01:19.373 --> 01:21.496
Now, I want you to remember...

01:22.835 --> 01:26.703
...that no bastard ever won a war...

01:27.632 --> 01:30.038
...by dying for his country.

01:32.093 --> 01:33.587
He won it...

01:34.637 --> 01:39.430
...by making the other poor dumb
bastard die for his country.

01:41.563 --> 01:42.972
Men...

01:44.815 --> 01:47.899
...all this stuff you've heard
about America not wanting to fight...

01:48.151 --> 01:50.274
...wanting to stay out of the war...

01:50.779 --> 01:52.771
...is a lot of horse dung.

01:53.156 --> 01:54.401
Americans...

01:54.865 --> 01:57.273
...traditionally love to fight.

01:57.535 --> 02:02.779
All real Americans love
the sting of battle.

02:04.543 --> 02:06.334
When you were kids...

02:07.878 --> 02:10.913
...you all admired
the champion marble shooter...

02:11.131 --> 02:15.711
...the fastest runner, big-league
ball players, the toughest boxers.

02:16.429 --> 02:18.836
Americans love a winner...

02:19.347 --> 02:21.969
...and will not tolerate a loser.

02:22.392 --> 02:24.717
Americans play to win all the time.

02:24.978 --> 02:29.891
I wouldn't give a hoot in hell
for a man who lost and laughed.

02:30.735 --> 02:35.941
Thas why Americans have never lost
and will never lose a war...

02:36.740 --> 02:39.491
...because the very thought
of losing...

02:40.410 --> 02:43.031
...is hateful to Americans.

02:44.538 --> 02:45.736
Now...

02:46.833 --> 02:50.119
...an army is a team.

02:50.837 --> 02:53.459
It lives, eats, sleeps,
fights as a team.

02:53.715 --> 02:56.632
This individuality stuff
is a bunch of crap.

02:56.884 --> 02:59.968
The bilious bastards who wrote
that stuff about individuality...

03:00.220 --> 03:02.629
...for the Saturday Evening Post...

03:03.057 --> 03:07.636
...don't know anything more about real
battle than they do about fornicating.

03:10.230 --> 03:14.097
Now we have the finest food
and equipment...

03:15.194 --> 03:17.436
...the best spirit...

03:17.696 --> 03:20.153
...and the best men in the world.

03:21.575 --> 03:22.606
You know...

03:24.077 --> 03:28.490
...by God, I actually pity those poor
bastards we're going up against.

03:28.707 --> 03:29.952
By God, I do.

03:30.166 --> 03:33.083
We're not just going to shoot
the bastards...

03:33.585 --> 03:36.540
...we're going to cut out
their living guts...

03:36.798 --> 03:40.630
...and use them to grease
the treads of our tanks.

03:40.886 --> 03:45.796
We're going to murder those lousy
Hun bastards by the bushel.

03:46.682 --> 03:47.880
Now...

03:49.184 --> 03:51.011
...some of you boys...

03:51.395 --> 03:53.519
...I know are wondering...

03:54.399 --> 03:58.312
...whether or not you'll chicken out
under fire. Don't worry about it.

03:59.861 --> 04:01.854
I can assure you...

04:02.322 --> 04:04.564
...that you will all do your duty.

04:06.076 --> 04:07.904
The Nazis...

04:08.413 --> 04:10.404
...are the enemy.

04:10.706 --> 04:12.497
Wade into them!

04:12.958 --> 04:16.161
Spill their blood!
Shoot them in the belly!

04:17.128 --> 04:19.584
When you put your hand...

04:20.214 --> 04:22.502
...into a bunch of goo...

04:22.758 --> 04:26.459
...that a moment before was
your best frienďs face...

04:28.765 --> 04:30.425
...you'll know what to do.

04:32.811 --> 04:35.217
There's another thing
I want you to remember.

04:36.981 --> 04:41.690
I don't want to get any messages
saying we are "holding our position."

04:42.195 --> 04:45.646
We're not "holding" anything.
Let the Hun do that.

04:46.324 --> 04:50.486
We're advancing constantly. We're not
interested in holding on to anything...

04:50.702 --> 04:52.529
...except the enemy.

04:52.787 --> 04:56.536
We're going to hold on to him
by the nose and kick him in the ass.

04:56.792 --> 04:58.999
We're going to kick the hell
out of him all the time...

04:59.211 --> 05:02.959
...and we're going to go through him
like crap through a goose!

05:05.217 --> 05:06.497
Now...

05:09.262 --> 05:11.089
...there's one thing...

05:11.722 --> 05:15.471
...that you men will be able to say
when you get back home.

05:16.394 --> 05:18.601
And you may thank God for it.

05:20.357 --> 05:24.021
Thirty years from now when you're
sitting around your fireside...

05:24.235 --> 05:26.725
...with your grandson on your knee...

05:27.863 --> 05:29.274
...and he asks you:

05:29.531 --> 05:32.983
"What did you do in the great
World War II?"

05:34.120 --> 05:36.111
You won't have to say:

05:37.998 --> 05:39.242
"Well...

05:40.708 --> 05:43.627
...I shovelled shit in Louisiana."

05:46.716 --> 05:49.467
All right, now, you sons of bitches...

05:50.052 --> 05:51.961
...you know how I feel.

05:57.017 --> 05:59.056
I will be proud...

06:00.186 --> 06:04.266
...to lead you wonderful guys
into battle anytime...

06:05.983 --> 06:07.395
...anywhere.

06:10.822 --> 06:12.233
Thas all.

11:05.273 --> 11:07.681
The Arabs need food and clothing.

11:08.068 --> 11:11.021
They strip our dead before
we can even bury them.

11:11.320 --> 11:14.155
Looks like the reports were
pretty accurate.

11:16.909 --> 11:20.112
Sixty-one armored vehicles,
45 tons of ammunition...

11:20.371 --> 11:25.197
...twenty-five 40mm guns,
three self-propelled 105s.

11:25.792 --> 11:28.165
Not counting mortars, machine guns,
rifles...

11:28.420 --> 11:32.916
...pistols, telescopes, belt buckles,
GI socks.

11:34.468 --> 11:37.504
One thousand, eight hundred men.

12:34.108 --> 12:36.349
Our people salute you, general...

12:36.611 --> 12:40.692
...for your brilliant amphibious
landing on the continent of Africa...

12:40.907 --> 12:44.608
...and for your enlightened
administration of our country.

12:45.579 --> 12:47.155
I've enjoyed being here, Excellency.

12:47.413 --> 12:50.912
Naturally, I'd prefer to be in Tunisia
fighting the Germans.

13:03.928 --> 13:07.843
"The lions in their dens
tremble at his approach."

13:09.477 --> 13:11.552
I appreciate that, Excellency.

14:13.996 --> 14:15.788
Magnificent!

14:16.207 --> 14:17.915
I wish our troops looked that good.

14:51.116 --> 14:54.983
Tell me, general,
what do you think of Morocco?

14:55.203 --> 14:56.484
I love it, Excellency.

14:56.746 --> 15:01.242
Is a combination
of the Bible and Hollywood.

15:45.126 --> 15:48.163
BRADLEY: These men fight at Kasserine?
CARVER: Yes, sir.

15:48.379 --> 15:50.953
For the American Army to take
a licking like that...

15:51.173 --> 15:53.795
...the first time at bat
against the Germans...

15:58.056 --> 16:00.891
Up against Rommel, what we need
is the best tank man we've got.

16:01.101 --> 16:03.426
Somebody tough enough
to pull this outfit together.

16:04.937 --> 16:07.344
- Patton?
- Possibly.

16:08.273 --> 16:09.982
God help us.

18:03.135 --> 18:04.547
Lieutenant...

18:04.971 --> 18:07.046
...where is the duty officer?

18:07.264 --> 18:08.509
Sir...

18:08.724 --> 18:13.432
- He said he's caught at shaving.
- Why isn't he here on duty?

18:13.937 --> 18:15.597
Guess he needed a shave.

18:15.855 --> 18:19.140
We got a new commanding general
due today.

18:44.049 --> 18:47.085
MAN: Who the hell is kicking me
in the butt?

18:50.514 --> 18:52.305
Oh, sorry, sir.

18:52.558 --> 18:56.887
- What were you doing down there?
- Trying to get some sleep, sir.

18:57.104 --> 18:58.681
Well...

18:58.897 --> 18:59.928
Get back down there, son.

19:00.190 --> 19:03.393
You're the only son of a bitch here
who knows what he's trying to do.

19:03.651 --> 19:05.229
Yes, sir.

19:09.072 --> 19:12.738
PATTON: Brad, how the hell are you?
- Fine, George. Good to see you.

19:12.952 --> 19:15.788
We were all under the impression
you wouldn't be here until 0900.

19:16.039 --> 19:17.948
Yes, I gathered that.

19:18.583 --> 19:21.500
- You know my boy, Dick Jenson.
- Yes.

19:21.919 --> 19:23.995
Brad, tell me.

19:24.463 --> 19:27.833
- What are you doing here?
- Ike wanted a report on Kasserine.

19:28.051 --> 19:30.588
Meanwhile, I have to stay here
as an observer...

19:30.845 --> 19:32.801
...but I report directly to Ike.

19:33.013 --> 19:34.423
You're spying.

19:34.889 --> 19:37.345
Get me General Eisenhower's
headquarters.

19:38.685 --> 19:40.678
Tell me, Brad...

19:41.814 --> 19:44.602
...what happened at Kasserine?
I heard it was a shambles.

19:44.817 --> 19:47.354
Apparently, everything went wrong.

19:48.278 --> 19:52.276
We'd send over a 75mm shell,
the krauts would return an 88.

19:52.532 --> 19:54.655
Their tanks are diesels.

19:55.285 --> 19:59.448
Even when we managed to hit one
they kept on running. Our tanks...

20:00.915 --> 20:02.789
The men call them
"Purple Heart boxes."

20:03.042 --> 20:05.616
One hot piece of shrapnel
and the gasoline explodes.

20:05.879 --> 20:07.207
I warned them about the tank.

20:07.464 --> 20:10.132
I talked to one of the
soldiers about the half-tracks.

20:10.382 --> 20:13.881
I asked them if the machine-gun
bullets pierced the armor.

20:14.136 --> 20:15.761
And he said, "No, sir.

20:16.014 --> 20:19.263
They just come through one side
and rattle around a bit."

20:20.142 --> 20:23.475
I understand they had a little trouble
coordinating the air cover.

20:23.728 --> 20:25.139
The trouble was no air cover.

20:25.396 --> 20:28.849
- General Smith on the line, sir.
- Excuse me, Brad.

20:34.573 --> 20:35.948
Bedell?

20:36.241 --> 20:40.535
Listen, I'm calling about Bradley
and his job here.

20:41.246 --> 20:45.742
I need a good number-two man, I want
to make Brad my deputy commander.

20:47.084 --> 20:48.876
You clear it with Ike?

20:50.004 --> 20:51.795
All right, thanks, Bedell.

20:52.089 --> 20:55.424
Now you're not spying for Eisenhower
anymore, you're working for me.

20:56.136 --> 20:58.093
- Okay?
- Fine, okay.

20:58.638 --> 21:01.804
Dick. You got those stars?

21:02.516 --> 21:04.722
- Yes, sir.
- Les get them on.

21:16.904 --> 21:20.025
Whas the matter, Brad?
I've been nominated by the president.

21:20.576 --> 21:24.953
I know, but it doesn't become official
until is approved by the Senate.

21:25.414 --> 21:26.824
Well...

21:27.457 --> 21:30.162
...they have their schedule
and I have mine.

21:35.465 --> 21:36.578
George...

21:37.925 --> 21:41.010
...if you were named admiral
of the Turkish Navy...

21:41.220 --> 21:43.427
...I believe your aides could dip
into their haversacks...

21:43.682 --> 21:45.758
...and come up with the appropriate
badge of rank.

21:46.893 --> 21:50.806
Anyway, congratulations.
Premature congratulations.

21:52.064 --> 21:53.522
You know...

21:54.192 --> 21:57.976
I think those stars look better
on a green shirt.

21:58.237 --> 22:02.898
Did I ever tell you about the time I
designed a uniform for tank crewmen?

22:04.450 --> 22:08.152
It was green leather,
it had red stripes...

22:08.414 --> 22:12.198
...and sort of a row of brass buttons
down across here.

22:12.460 --> 22:15.413
And topped off
by a gold football helmet.

22:16.338 --> 22:18.959
The Army rejected it, of course.

22:19.215 --> 22:20.544
Goddamn, it was beautiful.

22:22.135 --> 22:24.377
Lloyd Fredendall is just leaving.

22:58.462 --> 23:03.586
George, there's one other thing I put
in my Kasserine report.

23:04.050 --> 23:06.755
Some of our boys
were just plain scared.

23:07.012 --> 23:08.636
Thas understandable.

23:08.888 --> 23:11.640
Even the best foxhound is gun-shy
the first time out.

23:11.891 --> 23:13.599
I can remember...

23:14.267 --> 23:17.388
...when nothing frightened me
as much as the idea of...

23:17.647 --> 23:19.105
...a bullet coming
straight for my nose.

23:19.357 --> 23:23.437
I don't know why, but the image of a
bullet coming right for my nose...

23:23.695 --> 23:25.984
...was more horrible
than any other possibility.

23:26.197 --> 23:29.648
Well, I can understand that,
with such a handsome nose.

23:31.827 --> 23:34.864
You want to know why this outfit
got the hell kicked out of it?

23:35.164 --> 23:37.157
Blind man could see it in a minute.

23:37.583 --> 23:40.334
They don't look like soldiers.
They don't act like soldiers.

23:40.585 --> 23:42.163
Why should they fight like soldiers?

23:42.420 --> 23:45.706
You're absolutely right.
The discipline's pretty poor.

23:46.550 --> 23:49.718
In about 15 minutes we're going
to start turning these boys...

23:49.971 --> 23:52.591
...into fanatics, razors.

23:52.806 --> 23:55.297
They'll lose their fear
of the Germans.

23:55.892 --> 23:58.846
I hope to God they never lose
their fear of me.

24:19.373 --> 24:22.209
Up bright and early, general?
Breakfast?

24:22.418 --> 24:24.541
Have all my officers
finished breakfast?

24:24.795 --> 24:26.835
We're open from 6 till 8.

24:27.089 --> 24:29.544
Most of the officers are
just coming in, sir.

24:29.799 --> 24:32.255
Please inform these officers
the mess hall is closed.

24:33.011 --> 24:35.253
But, sir! Is only a quarter to 8.

24:35.514 --> 24:40.177
From now on, you will open at 6
and no one will be admitted after 6: 15.

24:40.435 --> 24:41.846
Where are your leggings?

24:42.104 --> 24:45.852
Leggings? Well, hell, general, sir,
I'm a cook.

24:47.525 --> 24:49.103
You're a soldier.

24:50.069 --> 24:51.101
$20 fine.

24:56.075 --> 24:57.450
Gentlemen...

24:58.285 --> 25:00.362
...from this moment any man...

25:00.580 --> 25:03.700
...without leggings, without a helmet,
without a tie...

25:04.417 --> 25:07.785
Any man with unshined shoes
or soiled uniform...

25:10.047 --> 25:11.672
...is going to be skinned.

25:51.630 --> 25:55.626
This is a barracks.
Is not a bordello.

26:23.493 --> 26:25.532
- Good morning.
- Good morning, sir.

26:26.371 --> 26:27.402
Doctor.

26:27.664 --> 26:28.695
Sir.

26:28.957 --> 26:33.168
I understand you have two cases
of self-inflicted wounds.

26:33.419 --> 26:34.747
Yes, sir, we do.

26:35.004 --> 26:36.498
Get them out of here.

26:36.756 --> 26:39.129
One has developed a serious infection.

26:39.384 --> 26:42.551
I don't care if he dies,
just get him out of here.

26:42.804 --> 26:46.172
Doesn't belong in the same room
with men wounded in battle.

26:46.557 --> 26:49.308
- I'll see that they're moved.
- One more thing.

26:49.644 --> 26:52.847
There'll be no "battle fatigue."
Thas an order.

26:53.522 --> 26:56.392
Battle fatigue is a free ride
to the hospital.

26:56.649 --> 26:58.725
I'm not going to subsidize cowardice.

26:58.985 --> 27:00.148
Yes, sir.

27:00.361 --> 27:03.696
Doctor...
Where's your helmet?

27:05.158 --> 27:07.650
I don't wear a helmet
in the hospital.

27:08.537 --> 27:09.782
Start.

27:10.038 --> 27:13.039
I can't use my stethoscope
when I'm wearing my helmet.

27:15.752 --> 27:17.032
Well...

27:18.671 --> 27:22.039
...then cut two holes in your helmet
so that you can.

27:22.550 --> 27:25.800
And get those yellow-bellies
out of here, today.

27:34.311 --> 27:35.591
Hold it.

27:36.438 --> 27:37.718
Turn right, here.

27:37.981 --> 27:39.975
The battlefield is ahead.

27:40.193 --> 27:42.481
Don't argue.
I can smell a battlefield.

27:42.737 --> 27:44.361
He was out here yesterday.

27:44.613 --> 27:47.282
Is over there. Turn right, damn it.

28:29.699 --> 28:31.276
It was here.

28:34.494 --> 28:36.285
The battlefield was here.

28:45.340 --> 28:48.375
The Carthaginians
defending the city...

28:48.633 --> 28:51.919
...were attacked by three
Roman legions.

28:53.763 --> 28:57.974
They were brave, but they
couldn't hold. They were massacred.

29:00.477 --> 29:02.138
Arab women...

29:02.855 --> 29:06.723
...stripped them of their tunics
and their swords and lances.

29:08.403 --> 29:10.360
The soldiers lay naked in the sun...

29:13.866 --> 29:15.692
...2000 years ago.

29:20.081 --> 29:21.741
I was here.

29:27.003 --> 29:28.414
You don't believe me.

29:32.009 --> 29:33.836
You know what the poet said:

29:35.138 --> 29:37.378
"Through the travail of ages

29:38.932 --> 29:42.182
Is the pomp and toils of war

29:42.685 --> 29:47.181
Have I fought and strove and perished

29:47.690 --> 29:50.311
Countless times upon the star

29:55.115 --> 29:58.032
As if through a glass and darkly

29:59.119 --> 30:01.787
The age-old strife I see

30:03.121 --> 30:05.956
Where I fought in many guises
Many names

30:07.668 --> 30:09.293
But always me."

30:16.259 --> 30:18.251
You know who the poet was?

30:21.056 --> 30:22.219
Me.

32:31.265 --> 32:34.551
There's an opportunity
for us to mount an offensive.

32:34.811 --> 32:36.850
We've concentrated on the flank...

32:37.104 --> 32:39.013
...draw strength from the British.

32:39.231 --> 32:41.519
It appears now that we could...

32:41.733 --> 32:43.642
...split the African corridor.

32:43.901 --> 32:45.360
Drive through Rommel to the sea.

32:45.611 --> 32:48.649
I'm sorry, but that territory
has been reserved...

32:48.907 --> 32:51.150
...for General Bernard Law Montgomery.

32:51.411 --> 32:54.280
We're supposed to let him win this one
no matter what.

32:54.538 --> 32:56.993
They're entitled to have their hero.

32:57.248 --> 33:00.498
Montgomery did push Rommel
clear across North Africa.

33:00.877 --> 33:03.996
What about the Americans?
Don't they need a hero too?

33:04.921 --> 33:06.581
You have anybody in mind?

33:08.884 --> 33:12.171
Air Vice-Marshal Coningham
is here with General Buford.

33:12.430 --> 33:13.841
Excuse me, gentlemen...

33:14.057 --> 33:19.050
...while I ask our British friends
whas happened to our air cover.

33:20.312 --> 33:21.806
BRADLEY:
Harry.

33:22.064 --> 33:23.310
How are you?

33:23.524 --> 33:25.731
George. Good to see you.

33:27.278 --> 33:29.732
- You know Arthur Coningham.
- Sir Arthur.

33:29.988 --> 33:31.482
Delighted to see you.

33:32.699 --> 33:34.691
I've heard so much about you.

33:39.499 --> 33:44.290
Gentlemen, it appears there's been a
slight misunderstanding here...

33:44.544 --> 33:46.620
...and Ike thought we should fix it.

33:46.880 --> 33:48.919
No, no. No misunderstanding.

33:49.174 --> 33:52.009
We're supposed to have Allied
air cover and we don't.

33:52.260 --> 33:54.963
German planes are strafing my troops.

33:55.220 --> 33:59.384
If I may say so, general, I'm afraid
your operation reports are inaccurate.

33:59.642 --> 34:03.261
Report? Three days ago, the crowds
took off after my command car...

34:03.480 --> 34:05.223
...ran my ass into a ditch.

34:05.440 --> 34:08.605
My staff has assured me,
we have complete air supremacy...

34:08.859 --> 34:10.567
...everywhere in the Mediterranean.

34:10.777 --> 34:12.853
PATTON:
When I complained about air cover...

34:13.114 --> 34:15.900
...you said our troops
were not battleworthy.

34:16.158 --> 34:20.985
You spoke of the discredited practice
of using air force as an alibi...

34:21.246 --> 34:24.163
...for lack of success on the ground.

34:24.415 --> 34:28.117
I have to wet-nurse Montgomery,
I don't have to stand for that.

34:28.378 --> 34:31.996
I sincerely apologize for that remark,
whoever made it.

34:33.216 --> 34:35.789
And I promise you one thing, general:

34:36.011 --> 34:38.299
You will see no more German planes.

34:50.442 --> 34:53.645
We were discussing air supremacy,
Sir Arthur.

35:26.976 --> 35:28.257
Damn door won't open!

35:42.075 --> 35:44.281
By God, thas enough!

36:03.345 --> 36:05.468
Get that thing out of here!

36:06.390 --> 36:09.675
Come on, you bastards,
take a shot at me on the nose!

36:09.935 --> 36:14.431
Get back in here, George! We need
a corps commander, not a casualty.

36:41.215 --> 36:43.089
CONINGHAM:
How'd you manage to stage that?

36:44.427 --> 36:45.541
I don't know...

36:45.803 --> 36:48.838
...but if I could find
the Nazis flying those things...

36:49.055 --> 36:51.131
...I'd give them each a medal.

37:12.077 --> 37:15.114
PATTON: Can't get over how cold
it gets in the desert.

37:15.748 --> 37:17.623
Awfully cold, sir.

37:48.321 --> 37:50.610
PATTON: Rommel's out there somewhere,
waiting for me.

37:50.865 --> 37:52.241
JENSON:
Yes, sir.

37:54.202 --> 37:55.577
PATTON:
You know...

37:56.704 --> 38:00.997
...if I had my way, I'd send
that genius son of a bitch...

38:01.458 --> 38:04.958
...an engraved invitation
in iambic pentameter:

38:05.546 --> 38:09.082
A challenge in two stanzas
to meet me alone in the desert.

38:09.718 --> 38:11.212
I'll deliver it.

38:14.763 --> 38:17.468
Rommel in his tank and me in mine.

38:18.559 --> 38:22.058
We'd stop about 20 paces.
We'd get out, we'd shake hands...

38:22.897 --> 38:26.015
...then we'd button up and do battle,
just the two of us.

38:27.275 --> 38:30.394
That battle would decide
the outcome of the war.

38:31.321 --> 38:34.358
Is too bad jousting's
gone out of style.

38:35.451 --> 38:37.324
Is like your poetry, general.

38:37.577 --> 38:40.199
It isn't part of the 20th century.

38:41.039 --> 38:42.913
You're right, Dick.

38:44.459 --> 38:46.451
The world grew up.

38:47.545 --> 38:49.169
Hell of a shame.

38:51.882 --> 38:55.049
Dick, I want a 24-hour guard
put around this area.

38:55.303 --> 38:57.759
If we don't, the Arabs will dig
them up for their clothes.

38:58.014 --> 38:59.390
Yes, sir.

39:00.100 --> 39:03.966
Our graves aren't gonna disappear
like everybody else's who fought here.

39:04.478 --> 39:08.772
The Greeks, Romans, Carthaginians.

39:11.360 --> 39:13.980
God, how I hate the 20th century.

41:39.378 --> 41:40.623
General.

41:41.088 --> 41:42.332
General?

41:43.840 --> 41:46.081
We intercepted a German radio message.

41:46.342 --> 41:50.175
Rommel's 10th Panzer is going
to hit us near El Guettar.

41:56.102 --> 41:57.894
Rommel, huh?

43:48.669 --> 43:50.294
All my life...

43:52.299 --> 43:55.502
...I've wanted to lead a lot of men
in a desperate battle.

44:02.390 --> 44:04.265
Now I'm going to do it.

44:15.487 --> 44:16.566
Look.

44:51.855 --> 44:53.480
Battalion strength at least.

46:16.437 --> 46:18.976
They haven't spotted our positions yet.

46:19.649 --> 46:23.018
They'll get an education
in about 10 seconds.

46:23.278 --> 46:26.028
Wait till they get a dose of
that artillery fire.

46:41.085 --> 46:43.292
Commence firing.
Fire at will.

46:45.215 --> 46:49.426
Commence firing. Fire at will.
Commence firing. Fire at will.

47:49.485 --> 47:52.105
What a hell of a waste
of fine infantry.

48:10.172 --> 48:12.628
- Get General Bradley on the radio.
- Yes, sir.

48:31.317 --> 48:33.061
Sir, I can't raise him.

48:33.278 --> 48:36.812
Go tell him to hit them hard. Here's
where we hold them by the nose...

48:37.031 --> 48:38.905
...and kick them in the ass.
Go on.

49:54.147 --> 49:55.855
Put him in my car.

51:50.051 --> 51:51.331
Rommel...

51:52.762 --> 51:56.545
...you magnificent bastard.
I read your book!

52:21.497 --> 52:24.831
PATTON: Captain Richard N. Jenson
was a fine boy.

52:25.293 --> 52:28.876
Loyal, unselfish and efficient.

52:32.051 --> 52:34.292
I am terribly sorry.

52:43.478 --> 52:46.810
There are no coffins here
since there is no wood.

52:47.605 --> 52:50.560
We will have a trumpeter
and an honor guard...

52:50.818 --> 52:55.148
...but we will not fire the volleys as
people would think an air raid was on.

53:11.337 --> 53:15.798
I enclosed a lock of Dick's hair
in a letter to his mother.

53:17.970 --> 53:19.594
He was a fine man...

53:20.347 --> 53:21.890
...and a fine officer.

53:22.724 --> 53:24.966
And he had no vices.

53:33.651 --> 53:35.607
I shall miss him a lot.

53:45.830 --> 53:49.993
I can 't see the reason
such fine young men get killed.

53:51.418 --> 53:54.170
There are so many battles
yet to fight.

54:09.144 --> 54:12.643
NARRATOR: Battle-weary, but
victorious, American Gls and Tommies...

54:12.897 --> 54:16.349
...of the British 8th Army meet in
an Allied victory celebration...

54:16.609 --> 54:19.183
...at Wadi Akarit in North Africa.

54:19.404 --> 54:23.816
For the first time in this war,
Broadway and Piccadillyjoin hands.

54:27.912 --> 54:30.830
Meanwhile, General Montgomery,
hero of El Alamein...

54:31.041 --> 54:33.994
...continues to lead his
victorious British 8th Army...

54:34.252 --> 54:38.379
...in a relentless drive against
Rommel's vaunted Africa corps.

56:41.041 --> 56:44.326
General Bradley's done
a tremendous job with 2nd Corps.

56:44.586 --> 56:47.871
He's moved into Bizerte
and taken over 41,000 prisoners.

56:48.131 --> 56:49.541
Good. Very good.

56:49.799 --> 56:54.342
You're not surprised, are you?
After all, you trained that outfit.

56:59.100 --> 57:00.678
- Excuse me, general.
- Hm?

57:00.935 --> 57:05.596
This is interesting. We've discovered
Rommel wasn't present at El Guettar.

57:05.981 --> 57:08.519
- Who says so?
- G2, sir.

57:10.319 --> 57:14.151
When we took 10th Panzer,
Rommel was in Berlin with an earache?

57:14.365 --> 57:16.522
Severe nasal diphtheria, sir.

57:16.783 --> 57:19.487
Also, Hitler probably
retained Rommel in Berlin...

57:19.744 --> 57:22.069
...because things were going badly
for the Africa Corps.

57:22.330 --> 57:25.000
He didn't want his favorite general
to lose face.

57:25.208 --> 57:27.783
I'm my favorite general,
and I don't like to be told...

57:28.045 --> 57:31.662
...that some second-stringer
is up against me. Then I lose face.

57:39.222 --> 57:41.047
Who the hell are you, anyway?

57:41.431 --> 57:44.801
CARVER: General, this is Lieutenant
Colonel Codman. Your new aide.

57:45.019 --> 57:48.768
Codman. I pulled your name off
the list because I know your family.

57:49.024 --> 57:50.138
I'm glad you did, sir.

57:50.400 --> 57:54.064
Rommel is the best the krauts have,
and I kicked the hell out of him.

57:54.319 --> 57:57.237
Now my own G2 section is telling
me he wasn't even there.

57:57.489 --> 58:01.701
But, general, he undoubtedly
planned the German battle.

58:02.328 --> 58:07.119
If you defeat Rommel's plan, you've
defeated Rommel. Isn't that true?

58:08.583 --> 58:09.828
Codman...

58:11.962 --> 58:14.631
- Have a drink with me tonight.
- Yes, sir.

58:14.840 --> 58:17.758
I have a plan
for the invasion of Sicily.

58:18.009 --> 58:21.923
I want to make sure I get it approved.
You can help me.

58:22.138 --> 58:24.807
I want to give a dinner
for General Alexander.

58:25.016 --> 58:26.510
Get to him before Montgomery does.

58:26.768 --> 58:32.009
This will be strictly a formal affair,
Codman, but purely social.

58:32.356 --> 58:33.815
By that I mean...

58:34.024 --> 58:36.183
...purely political.
- Yes, sir.

58:36.444 --> 58:39.231
I want the finest food, the best wine
available. Everything, comme il faut.

59:08.892 --> 59:10.516
Thank you.

59:11.186 --> 59:14.021
George, this is really splendid wine.

59:14.230 --> 59:15.510
Thank you, Arthur.

59:18.609 --> 59:19.889
Thank you.

59:22.196 --> 59:26.574
Sir Harold, I think it was Alcibiades
in the Peloponnesian War...

59:26.785 --> 59:28.445
...415 B.C.

59:28.661 --> 59:32.610
He said, "If Syracuse falls, all
Sicily falls, and then Italy."

59:32.873 --> 59:36.372
He knew that Syracuse was the
jugular of the island.

59:36.626 --> 59:39.414
Old Alcibiades always went
for the throat.

59:39.672 --> 59:41.748
I propose to take Sicily
in the same way.

59:41.966 --> 59:45.168
- How's it going?
- The old man has them in his pocket.

59:48.846 --> 59:50.674
PATTON:
Now, according to my plan...

59:50.891 --> 59:53.927
...General Montgomery will land here.

59:55.146 --> 59:57.636
I'll hit the beaches here,
take Palermo.

59:57.856 --> 01:00:01.271
Monty will drive north on the coast,
I'll come due east...

01:00:01.526 --> 01:00:04.195
...take Messina and cut off
the German escape route.

01:00:04.529 --> 01:00:06.153
Yes...

01:00:06.364 --> 01:00:08.605
It looks like an interesting plan.

01:00:08.823 --> 01:00:12.276
Well, gentlemen,
to the conquest of Sicily.

01:00:13.162 --> 01:00:14.324
ALEXANDER:
To the conquest of Sicily.

01:00:14.956 --> 01:00:16.581
OFFICERS:
To Sicily!

01:00:17.375 --> 01:00:20.661
George, you'd have made a great
marshal for Napoleon...

01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:22.579
...if you'd lived in the 18th century.

01:00:22.921 --> 01:00:26.206
But I did, sir. I did.

01:01:02.751 --> 01:01:04.792
Morning. Is General Smith in?

01:01:05.046 --> 01:01:08.130
MAN: I believe he's in the lavatory.
- Thank you.

01:01:15.347 --> 01:01:18.017
- Ah, there you are, Bedell.
- Monty.

01:01:18.267 --> 01:01:22.181
Bedell, I've been giving a good bit of
thought to the Sicily operation.

01:01:22.438 --> 01:01:23.551
Yes?

01:01:24.522 --> 01:01:26.064
I assume we're alone.

01:01:26.274 --> 01:01:29.690
Georgie Patton has already
discussed his plan with Alexander.

01:01:29.945 --> 01:01:31.059
I realize that...

01:01:31.321 --> 01:01:35.235
...but I have an idea that his plan
may lead to an absolute disaster.

01:01:35.450 --> 01:01:36.695
Oh?

01:01:40.496 --> 01:01:41.576
Bedell, look.

01:01:41.789 --> 01:01:44.078
This is Sicily.

01:01:44.834 --> 01:01:47.750
Now then, according to Patton's plan...

01:01:47.961 --> 01:01:50.453
...I will attack Syracuse here.

01:01:50.673 --> 01:01:53.164
And he would attack Palermo up here.

01:01:53.426 --> 01:01:55.751
Now, obviously our forces would be
divided.

01:01:56.012 --> 01:01:58.717
And obviously, they
could be chopped up piecemeal.

01:01:58.973 --> 01:02:03.634
Now then, what I propose, and what
I shall insist on, by the way...

01:02:03.852 --> 01:02:05.097
...is this.

01:02:07.189 --> 01:02:10.107
I will land at Syracuse as planned.

01:02:10.317 --> 01:02:14.017
But the Americans-
The Americans will land here, at Gela.

01:02:14.237 --> 01:02:19.279
I will advance north to Messina,
the Americans protecting my flank.

01:02:19.493 --> 01:02:22.447
After all, Messina is the key.

01:02:22.705 --> 01:02:25.277
Is the reason for invading Sicily.

01:02:26.458 --> 01:02:29.031
I'll discuss your plan with Ike.

01:02:30.003 --> 01:02:32.790
I'm sure he'll give it
serious consideration.

01:02:38.009 --> 01:02:39.385
- Amusing, isn't it?
- What?

01:02:39.637 --> 01:02:41.345
That the plans for the
invasion of Sicily...

01:02:41.597 --> 01:02:44.468
...should have been put forward
in an Algerian lavatory.

01:02:44.893 --> 01:02:48.226
George, I have bad news for you
about your Sicily plan.

01:02:48.479 --> 01:02:50.518
Ike has turned it down.

01:02:50.897 --> 01:02:55.311
Since the Italians will be defending
their native soil for the first time...

01:02:55.528 --> 01:03:00.106
...and the German resistance is
stiffening, we shouldn't be divided.

01:03:00.949 --> 01:03:04.863
- Well, where do my people land then?
- In the Gulf of Gela.

01:03:05.077 --> 01:03:06.702
There's nothing there
but a beach.

01:03:06.954 --> 01:03:10.953
Yes, but it puts you in a good
position to support Montgomery.

01:03:12.044 --> 01:03:13.751
Where does Montgomery land?

01:03:14.004 --> 01:03:18.250
He'll land in Syracuse and drive north
to Catania. Possibly even Messina.

01:03:18.675 --> 01:03:21.794
And you'll be alongside,
protecting his left.

01:03:22.303 --> 01:03:23.466
I see.

01:03:25.389 --> 01:03:29.802
In other words, we get the burden again
while good old Monty gets the glory.

01:03:30.060 --> 01:03:32.848
Ike had to consider all points of view.

01:03:33.064 --> 01:03:36.398
He made his decision not as an
American, but as an Ally.

01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:40.775
Had it been the other way around,
I assure you, Monty would protest.

01:03:42.113 --> 01:03:43.276
No...

01:03:44.784 --> 01:03:47.025
...I've been in the Army 30 years.

01:03:47.411 --> 01:03:51.823
When I get an order, I say, "Yes, sir."
And I do my best to carry it out.

01:03:55.918 --> 01:04:00.047
This is what happens when your
commander stops being an American...

01:04:00.466 --> 01:04:02.458
...and starts being an Ally.

01:05:13.536 --> 01:05:15.778
I don't think I've made
myself clear, sir.

01:05:16.039 --> 01:05:19.620
Is true, Montgomery met the
toughest resistance there at Catania.

01:05:19.833 --> 01:05:20.782
However, if we're-

01:05:21.042 --> 01:05:22.454
Perfectly clear.

01:05:22.712 --> 01:05:26.756
Old Monty is as stuck
as a bug on flypaper.

01:05:27.591 --> 01:05:29.713
But this order from
General Alexander...

01:05:29.967 --> 01:05:33.799
...directing you to turn over the
Vizzini-Caltagirone road to Montgomery.

01:05:34.388 --> 01:05:37.556
Well, then, old Bradley will have to
slug- slug, mind you...

01:05:37.767 --> 01:05:42.560
...his way up center of the island over
those tough mountain roads, won't he?

01:05:42.814 --> 01:05:44.012
Yes, sir.

01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:46.314
Messina, Bell.

01:05:46.859 --> 01:05:47.974
Messina...

01:05:49.028 --> 01:05:52.064
...is the heart of it. If they'd
followed my plan, I'd be there by now.

01:05:52.281 --> 01:05:55.697
I'd cut off the retreat of every
German on this island!

01:05:56.744 --> 01:05:58.701
Now, you know what I'm gonna do?

01:05:58.954 --> 01:06:00.284
I'm gonna go to Palermo.

01:06:00.540 --> 01:06:04.538
I'm gonna beat that limey at Messina
if is the last thing I ever do!

01:06:04.752 --> 01:06:09.247
Hey, whas all this talk about taking
the Vizzini road away from 2nd Corps?

01:06:12.635 --> 01:06:15.505
General Alexander's orders.
Road goes to Montgomery.

01:06:15.763 --> 01:06:18.431
Now, that road was assigned to me.

01:06:19.182 --> 01:06:21.969
How can I get north without it?
You know the terrain there.

01:06:22.184 --> 01:06:26.349
I'm sorry, Brad. But Monty's run
into tough opposition. Very tough.

01:06:28.859 --> 01:06:32.523
You wouldn't be taking advantage of
this situation, would you?

01:06:32.779 --> 01:06:34.273
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:06:34.531 --> 01:06:37.697
Without that road, your army,
except for my 2nd Corps...

01:06:37.909 --> 01:06:39.284
...would be out of a job.

01:06:39.827 --> 01:06:41.903
Free for you to go into Palermo.

01:06:42.163 --> 01:06:44.285
Who said anything about Palermo?

01:06:45.749 --> 01:06:47.623
I can read a map.

01:06:48.670 --> 01:06:51.161
Does Alexander know
you've pushed out this far?

01:06:51.422 --> 01:06:54.092
Thas a reconnaissance in force.

01:06:57.052 --> 01:06:58.250
George...

01:07:00.180 --> 01:07:02.506
...are you saying I've got to slug
it out in those mountains...

01:07:02.767 --> 01:07:04.925
...with heavy resistance?

01:07:05.477 --> 01:07:08.477
Just so you can make
a bigger splash than Monty?

01:07:09.063 --> 01:07:10.344
General...

01:07:11.274 --> 01:07:13.397
...I just follow my orders.

01:07:13.652 --> 01:07:16.190
Like the simple old soldier I am.

01:07:17.155 --> 01:07:18.698
General Bradley.

01:07:19.783 --> 01:07:22.867
Sir, General Alexander has heard
we're moving west.

01:07:23.119 --> 01:07:27.448
He says here, "Stop immediately.
Go no farther than Agrigento.

01:07:27.707 --> 01:07:30.577
Repeat. Stop, immediately."

01:07:31.335 --> 01:07:33.493
Thas what you think it says.

01:07:33.879 --> 01:07:36.833
I think it was garbled
in transmission.

01:07:37.091 --> 01:07:39.629
Ask them to re-transmit the message.

01:07:39.886 --> 01:07:42.044
Thall take half a day at least.

01:07:42.263 --> 01:07:43.342
Yes, sir.

01:07:47.601 --> 01:07:49.143
Now, Brad.

01:07:51.856 --> 01:07:53.314
Where were we?

01:07:55.192 --> 01:07:57.896
We were talking about a simple...

01:07:58.111 --> 01:07:59.770
...old soldier.

01:08:30.225 --> 01:08:31.685
Look at that, gentlemen.

01:08:34.020 --> 01:08:35.846
Compared to war...

01:08:36.314 --> 01:08:39.600
...all other forms of human endeavor
shrink to insignificance.

01:08:40.444 --> 01:08:42.733
Les go, sergeant.
Move out!

01:09:32.411 --> 01:09:34.450
Give me that helmet.

01:09:37.038 --> 01:09:38.831
Come on, les get out of here!

01:09:51.136 --> 01:09:53.426
What silly son of a bitch
is in charge of this operation?

01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:56.350
I don't know, but they
ought to hang him.

01:10:08.446 --> 01:10:09.857
PATTON:
Afternoon, Padre.

01:10:10.073 --> 01:10:12.693
PADRE: These men are here from the
States, looking over our program...

01:10:12.949 --> 01:10:14.741
...for the spiritual welfare
of the men.

01:10:14.951 --> 01:10:16.659
We'll take you right into Palermo.

01:10:16.911 --> 01:10:19.071
Col. David toured us around
your quarters...

01:10:19.331 --> 01:10:24.039
...and I saw a Bible by your bed.
Do you actually find time to read it?

01:10:24.752 --> 01:10:26.081
I sure do.

01:10:26.337 --> 01:10:28.246
Every goddamn day.

01:10:51.195 --> 01:10:53.686
Sir, Patton's taken Palermo!

01:10:54.866 --> 01:10:55.696
Damn!

01:11:14.050 --> 01:11:16.754
Palermo's the most conquered city
in history.

01:11:17.011 --> 01:11:18.920
First the Phoenicians...

01:11:19.348 --> 01:11:22.882
...the Romans,
Carthaginians, Byzantines.

01:11:23.143 --> 01:11:24.887
Then came the Arabs...

01:11:25.146 --> 01:11:27.682
...Spaniards, Neapolitans.

01:11:27.897 --> 01:11:29.356
Now comes...

01:11:29.566 --> 01:11:31.439
...the American Army.

01:11:41.619 --> 01:11:43.611
This is from General Alexander, sir...

01:11:43.872 --> 01:11:47.075
...reminding you that you are
not to take Palermo.

01:11:47.667 --> 01:11:49.790
Send him a message, Cod.

01:11:50.085 --> 01:11:52.327
Ask him if he
wants me to give it back.

01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:40.459
PATTON: Let me ask you a question
for a change.

01:12:40.717 --> 01:12:42.626
You've just come from Washington.

01:12:42.928 --> 01:12:45.384
How do they feel about our boys
taking Palermo?

01:12:45.639 --> 01:12:49.851
The general impression is, your army
barreled through token resistance...

01:12:50.102 --> 01:12:52.473
...while Montgomery faced the brunt
of the fighting.

01:12:52.728 --> 01:12:55.480
Don't they know we took on
the Hermann Göring division?

01:12:55.731 --> 01:12:57.142
Toughest outfit in the German Army.

01:12:57.400 --> 01:12:59.477
The people at home
are interested in you.

01:12:59.694 --> 01:13:01.937
They're curious about your
pearl-handle revolvers.

01:13:02.156 --> 01:13:05.275
They're ivory. Only a pimp
from a New Orleans whorehouse...

01:13:05.533 --> 01:13:07.158
...would carry a pearl handle.

01:13:07.368 --> 01:13:09.028
What about your language?

01:13:09.287 --> 01:13:12.371
When I want it to stick,
I give it to them loud and dirty.

01:13:12.623 --> 01:13:14.450
What do your troops feel about that?

01:13:14.709 --> 01:13:18.076
I don't want these men to love me.
I want them to fight for me.

01:13:18.462 --> 01:13:22.591
Ernie Pyle says you have a secret
weapon here: General Bradley.

01:13:22.801 --> 01:13:24.674
Ernie calls him "The GI General."

01:13:24.886 --> 01:13:28.006
Omar Bradley is no secret.
He's a damn fine commander.

01:13:28.264 --> 01:13:30.505
MAN:
Whas your feeling about Montgomery?

01:13:30.765 --> 01:13:32.924
PATTON:
He's the best general the English have.

01:13:33.184 --> 01:13:36.768
He seems more concerned with not
losing than he does about winning.

01:13:37.022 --> 01:13:40.107
He's not aggressive enough,
is that correct?

01:13:40.650 --> 01:13:43.437
Look, I've been getting into
a lot of trouble lately.

01:13:43.694 --> 01:13:46.648
Yesterday, the office told me
that my Italian prisoners...

01:13:46.907 --> 01:13:48.698
...didn't have enough latrine.

01:13:49.284 --> 01:13:52.321
They didn't know what a
latrine was till I showed them.

01:13:52.580 --> 01:13:55.948
If I've said anything too critical
of my British colleague...

01:13:56.165 --> 01:13:57.494
...les forget about it.

01:13:57.750 --> 01:14:00.751
I will tell you one thing, though.
Off the record.

01:14:01.546 --> 01:14:03.253
I'm gonna beat that...

01:14:03.464 --> 01:14:05.337
...gentleman to Messina.

01:14:13.558 --> 01:14:17.009
Ah, Freddie. Do you realize what
this madman Patton is saying?

01:14:17.270 --> 01:14:19.510
He's going to save our skins
by taking Messina.

01:14:19.771 --> 01:14:21.811
This report might interest you.

01:14:22.065 --> 01:14:25.649
Here I am in these bloody marshes,
fighting malaria and Germans...

01:14:25.903 --> 01:14:29.236
...while he's taking Palermo
and getting all the glory.

01:14:31.074 --> 01:14:32.236
Well!

01:14:32.450 --> 01:14:36.199
Now he's up against three good
German divisions and he's stuck.

01:14:36.455 --> 01:14:38.198
He's not going to get Messina.

01:14:38.456 --> 01:14:41.826
Thas reserved for the
British 8th Army and me.

01:14:48.383 --> 01:14:52.676
Is time for a move, Lucian. Terry
Allen's 1 st Division is bogged down.

01:14:52.929 --> 01:14:54.552
You're bogged down too.

01:14:54.804 --> 01:14:58.091
What we need is another end run
just to break things loose.

01:14:59.601 --> 01:15:02.687
- Lucian. How's my fighter?
- Fine, George.

01:15:03.022 --> 01:15:07.268
Come in, come in. We need another
one of your amphibious specialties.

01:15:10.487 --> 01:15:14.651
Lucian, I want you to send a
reinforced battalion by sea...

01:15:14.909 --> 01:15:18.324
...to make a landing up here at Brolo
behind the kraut lines.

01:15:18.579 --> 01:15:20.950
You want me to do a land-based attack.

01:15:21.205 --> 01:15:24.491
Right. I want a coordinated
attack the morning of the 11 th.

01:15:24.750 --> 01:15:26.958
I don't think we can make it
by the 11 th.

01:15:27.212 --> 01:15:32.087
- Hell, is only 15, 20 miles.
- My boys have been dying for yards.

01:15:33.092 --> 01:15:34.290
Hm.

01:15:34.719 --> 01:15:37.636
Maybe you better kick a few butts
if you have to.

01:15:38.639 --> 01:15:41.593
I recommended you for your DSM
in your last promotion.

01:15:41.809 --> 01:15:44.299
I know what you can do when
you put your mind to it.

01:15:44.894 --> 01:15:46.603
Excuse me, sir.

01:15:47.898 --> 01:15:50.983
I'm sorry, but I can't
do the impossible.

01:15:52.237 --> 01:15:55.984
You're too old an athlete to think
you can postpone a scheduled match.

01:15:56.198 --> 01:15:59.780
You're an old athlete yourself.
You know matches are postponed.

01:16:00.035 --> 01:16:04.329
If we can't back Lucian up by land,
our end run could be a disaster.

01:16:04.540 --> 01:16:08.488
Those men might get caught
on the beach and cut to pieces.

01:16:08.710 --> 01:16:11.283
- Whas the matter?
BRADLEY: All we're saying is...

01:16:11.504 --> 01:16:14.173
...not to rush in until we're ready.

01:16:14.423 --> 01:16:16.216
Give him an extra day.

01:16:16.426 --> 01:16:17.837
Just one more day.

01:16:18.219 --> 01:16:20.178
The landing is on.

01:16:20.638 --> 01:16:21.836
We're going to Messina.

01:16:22.223 --> 01:16:25.592
We're going to get there before
Montgomery does.

01:16:25.810 --> 01:16:30.306
- Whas so important about that?
- General Truscott...

01:16:30.565 --> 01:16:34.264
...if your conscience won't permit
you to conduct this operation...

01:16:34.484 --> 01:16:36.145
...I'll find somebody who can.

01:16:36.362 --> 01:16:41.439
General, is your privilege to
relieve me anytime you want to.

01:16:41.659 --> 01:16:44.779
This match will not be postponed.

01:16:46.997 --> 01:16:48.195
Any questions?

01:16:54.004 --> 01:16:55.167
No, sir.

01:16:55.589 --> 01:16:58.126
You're a very good man, Lucian.

01:16:58.382 --> 01:17:01.253
You want to guard against
being too conservative.

01:17:01.469 --> 01:17:03.711
Remember what
Frederick the Great said:

01:17:03.930 --> 01:17:08.593
"L 'audace, I'audace!
Toujours I'audace!"

01:17:10.603 --> 01:17:12.512
Go on, have a drink.

01:17:13.690 --> 01:17:18.766
Excuse me, sir, I won't be drinking
for the next couple of days.

01:17:22.405 --> 01:17:25.905
If anything happens to those men,
I'd like to be there with them.

01:17:28.913 --> 01:17:31.285
You're not going, so forget about it.

01:17:32.959 --> 01:17:35.449
You believe Truscos right?

01:17:36.294 --> 01:17:37.575
No.

01:17:39.130 --> 01:17:41.836
But you're gambling
with those boys' lives...

01:17:42.051 --> 01:17:44.624
...just to beat Montgomery
into Messina.

01:17:45.804 --> 01:17:49.219
If you pull it off, you're a hero,
but if you don't...

01:17:50.099 --> 01:17:54.014
What happens to them?
The ordinary combat soldier.

01:17:54.813 --> 01:17:58.811
He doesn't share in your dreams
of glory, he's stuck here.

01:17:59.567 --> 01:18:04.443
He's living out every day, day-to-day,
with death tugging at his elbow.

01:18:08.326 --> 01:18:11.528
There's one big difference
between you and me, George.

01:18:13.414 --> 01:18:16.331
I do this job because I've been
trained to do it.

01:18:17.084 --> 01:18:18.828
You do it because...

01:18:20.964 --> 01:18:22.588
...you love it.

01:18:38.688 --> 01:18:41.475
The men on the beach are
catching hell, general.

01:18:41.732 --> 01:18:45.351
The men are doing their best.
We have no replacements.

01:18:45.570 --> 01:18:48.109
I can't break through to the coast.

01:18:48.364 --> 01:18:50.322
I'm going down there myself.

01:19:05.381 --> 01:19:06.792
PATTON:
Colonel!

01:19:07.884 --> 01:19:09.627
How did he get over there?

01:19:09.928 --> 01:19:11.801
PATTON:
What the hell are you waiting for?

01:19:12.013 --> 01:19:15.546
Looking for a place to ford, general.

01:19:15.765 --> 01:19:17.758
I sent a patrol to reconnoiter.

01:19:17.976 --> 01:19:22.437
PATTON: I've done that. Down there
this sewer's no more than 3 feet deep.

01:19:22.648 --> 01:19:25.767
Get that outfit cranked up
or you'll be out of a job!

01:19:27.860 --> 01:19:30.980
- And put that helmet on.
- Yes, sir.

01:19:46.045 --> 01:19:48.168
Move it! Les go!

01:19:58.057 --> 01:20:01.557
- Whas holding up this column?
- I don't know, sir.

01:20:01.769 --> 01:20:02.883
Planes!

01:20:07.273 --> 01:20:08.733
Come on, move it!

01:20:32.048 --> 01:20:33.542
Pull up over there.

01:20:39.846 --> 01:20:41.471
- Come on.
- Whas going on here?

01:20:41.682 --> 01:20:42.595
Sir, these mules-

01:20:42.808 --> 01:20:43.839
Jackasses!

01:20:44.226 --> 01:20:48.688
You let a column get stalled and
strafed on account of two jackasses?!

01:20:53.068 --> 01:20:54.811
No. No.

01:21:02.536 --> 01:21:05.452
Now, dump them over the side
and clear this bridge!

01:21:52.668 --> 01:21:55.537
We're pinned down because
we can't get air support!

01:21:55.795 --> 01:21:57.871
Nobody's getting any air support!

01:21:58.089 --> 01:22:01.293
Put fire into this battalion,
or I'll get somebody who can.

01:22:01.509 --> 01:22:02.790
Major!

01:22:03.262 --> 01:22:04.922
- You the executive officer here?
- Yes, sir.

01:22:05.138 --> 01:22:06.466
- Your name?
- Walker.

01:22:06.681 --> 01:22:08.389
You're now commanding officer.

01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:11.007
You've got 4 hours to break through
that beachhead.

01:22:11.227 --> 01:22:13.220
If you don't make it, I'll fire you.

01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:27.239
50,000 men on this island would
like to shoot that son of a bitch.

01:23:02.481 --> 01:23:05.820
Please take me home.
Take me home.

01:23:06.694 --> 01:23:09.364
Please take me home.
Take me home.

01:23:33.179 --> 01:23:38.310
- There he goes, "Old Blood and Guts."
- Yeah, our blood. His guts.

01:23:45.694 --> 01:23:47.111
Hi, how are you, son?

01:23:54.993 --> 01:23:56.786
Where are you from, Gomez?

01:23:58.163 --> 01:24:00.080
California, sir.

01:24:00.291 --> 01:24:01.918
Me too.

01:24:02.376 --> 01:24:06.295
- Where were you hit?
- In the chest, sir.

01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:08.174
Well...

01:24:08.633 --> 01:24:13.762
...this might be interesting to you.
The last German I saw had no chest.

01:24:14.263 --> 01:24:16.097
Didn't have any head either.

01:24:18.183 --> 01:24:20.060
You get well quickly, son.

01:26:16.885 --> 01:26:18.511
Whas the matter with you?

01:26:22.473 --> 01:26:25.393
I guess I just can't take it, sir.

01:26:29.397 --> 01:26:30.815
What did you say?

01:26:34.318 --> 01:26:36.237
Is my nerves, sir.

01:26:37.739 --> 01:26:40.617
I just can't stand
the shelling anymore.

01:26:43.159 --> 01:26:44.995
Your nerves?

01:26:46.831 --> 01:26:49.793
Hell, you're just a goddamn coward.

01:26:52.253 --> 01:26:53.547
Shut up!

01:26:55.798 --> 01:26:58.133
I won't have
a yellow bastard crying...

01:26:58.550 --> 01:27:00.845
...in front of these
brave, wounded men.

01:27:04.223 --> 01:27:05.641
Shut up!

01:27:08.394 --> 01:27:12.105
Don't admit this yellow bastard.
Nothing wrong with him.

01:27:12.356 --> 01:27:17.069
I won't have sons of bitches afraid to
fight stink up this place of honor.

01:27:17.654 --> 01:27:20.239
You're going back to the front,
my friend.

01:27:20.447 --> 01:27:25.119
You may get shot, you may get killed,
but you're going up to the fighting.

01:27:25.704 --> 01:27:29.247
Either that or I'll stand you up
in front of a firing squad.

01:27:29.665 --> 01:27:33.794
I should shoot you myself,
you bastard! Get him out of here!

01:27:36.088 --> 01:27:37.549
Send him up to the front!

01:27:37.799 --> 01:27:41.928
You hear me? You goddamn coward!

01:27:51.019 --> 01:27:53.190
I won't have cowards in my army.

01:28:23.678 --> 01:28:25.180
I had to kick a few butts...

01:28:25.388 --> 01:28:29.600
...but Truscott finally broke through
to those people on the beach.

01:28:29.851 --> 01:28:31.977
Have you seen the casualty lists?

01:28:32.729 --> 01:28:34.271
Yes, I've seen them.

01:28:35.149 --> 01:28:36.857
Whas the word from the coast road?

01:28:37.067 --> 01:28:39.943
The 3rd Division's east of Brolo,
heading toward Messina.

01:28:40.152 --> 01:28:43.612
Les get over there.
I want to go in with the troops.

01:28:43.822 --> 01:28:46.783
You go ahead, George.
I'm not very good at that.

01:28:48.578 --> 01:28:50.121
General Bradley...

01:28:50.331 --> 01:28:53.832
...is time to consider how many
casualties we'd have...

01:28:54.039 --> 01:28:57.419
...if we were still crawling on
that goddamn road.

01:30:24.006 --> 01:30:26.049
Forward, march!

01:30:44.444 --> 01:30:46.403
Don't smirk, Patton.
I shan't kiss you.

01:30:47.572 --> 01:30:52.701
Pity. I shaved close this morning
to prepare for getting smacked by you.

01:31:01.461 --> 01:31:03.378
Forward, march!

01:31:38.246 --> 01:31:40.291
You wanted to see me, George?

01:31:42.918 --> 01:31:44.878
Got a letter here from Ike.

01:31:53.554 --> 01:31:56.765
I was rereading Caesar's
Commentaries last night.

01:31:59.436 --> 01:32:04.231
In battle, Caesar wore a red robe to
distinguish him from his men.

01:32:04.438 --> 01:32:06.985
I was struck by that fact because-

01:32:09.736 --> 01:32:13.447
"Despicable." First time anybody's
ever applied that word to me.

01:32:13.739 --> 01:32:18.037
Well, at least is a personal
reprimand, is not official.

01:32:18.286 --> 01:32:21.789
The man was yellow. He shoulďve
been tried for cowardice and shot.

01:32:22.039 --> 01:32:26.421
People have taken a lot worse
than a little kick in the pants.

01:32:26.670 --> 01:32:30.133
I ruffled his pride a bit.
Whas that compared to war?

01:32:30.799 --> 01:32:34.886
Two weeks ago at Palermo they said
I was the greatest general...

01:32:35.094 --> 01:32:39.476
...since Stonewall Jackson.
- Now they draw cartoons about you.

01:32:39.682 --> 01:32:41.600
Dirty bastard!

01:32:42.061 --> 01:32:46.190
They got me holding a little GI
and kicking him with an iron boot.

01:32:46.398 --> 01:32:48.899
You see that, whas on my boot?
A swastika.

01:32:49.149 --> 01:32:52.445
On my boot.
An iron boot with a swastika!

01:32:56.951 --> 01:33:00.370
"You will apologize to the soldier
you slapped...

01:33:00.997 --> 01:33:05.250
...to all doctors and nurses present
in the tent at the time...

01:33:05.500 --> 01:33:08.546
...to every patient in the tent
who can be reached...

01:33:08.962 --> 01:33:12.341
...and last but not least
to the 7th Army as a whole...

01:33:12.717 --> 01:33:15.594
...through individual units,
one at a time."

01:33:20.765 --> 01:33:22.266
God, I...

01:33:23.977 --> 01:33:25.604
...feel low.

01:33:32.653 --> 01:33:34.154
PATTON:
Oh, God...

01:33:34.403 --> 01:33:36.281
...Thou art my God.

01:33:37.280 --> 01:33:39.367
Early will I seek Thee.

01:33:40.034 --> 01:33:43.120
My soul thirsteth for Thee.

01:33:43.370 --> 01:33:47.833
My flesh longeth for Thee
in a dry and thirsty land.

01:33:48.082 --> 01:33:51.672
So as I have seen Thee
in the sanctuary.

01:33:51.879 --> 01:33:55.093
My soul followeth hard after Thee.

01:33:56.050 --> 01:34:00.095
But those that seek my soul
to destroy it...

01:34:00.304 --> 01:34:03.766
...shall go into the lower parts
of the earth.

01:34:04.434 --> 01:34:07.687
They shall fall by the sword.

01:34:07.896 --> 01:34:11.690
They shall be apportioned for foxes.

01:34:12.776 --> 01:34:15.861
But the king shall rejoice in God.

01:34:16.698 --> 01:34:20.158
Everyone that sweareth by him
shall glory.

01:34:20.909 --> 01:34:25.247
But the mouth of them
that speak lies...

01:34:25.913 --> 01:34:28.208
...shall be stopped.

01:34:32.504 --> 01:34:34.755
Ten-hut!

01:34:36.840 --> 01:34:38.176
PATTON:
At ease.

01:34:50.897 --> 01:34:54.235
I thought I'd stand up here
and let you people see...

01:34:56.109 --> 01:35:00.280
...if I am as big a son of a bitch
as some of you think I am.

01:35:05.119 --> 01:35:07.789
I assure you I had no intention...

01:35:08.662 --> 01:35:12.585
...of being either harsh or cruel
in my treatment of the...

01:35:13.168 --> 01:35:14.838
...soldier in question.

01:35:19.843 --> 01:35:22.428
My sole purpose was to try
to restore in him...

01:35:22.636 --> 01:35:25.724
...some appreciation of his
obligations as a man...

01:35:27.309 --> 01:35:29.059
...and as a soldier.

01:35:30.979 --> 01:35:33.147
If one can shame a coward...

01:35:34.941 --> 01:35:39.277
...I felt one might help him
to regain his self-respect.

01:35:41.824 --> 01:35:43.407
This was on my mind.

01:35:45.743 --> 01:35:48.246
Now, I freely admit...

01:35:48.455 --> 01:35:50.540
...that my method was wrong...

01:35:51.457 --> 01:35:53.709
...but I hope you understand
my motive...

01:35:55.128 --> 01:35:57.214
...and will accept this...

01:35:57.756 --> 01:35:59.507
...explanation...

01:36:01.174 --> 01:36:02.636
...and this...

01:36:04.721 --> 01:36:05.971
...apology.

01:36:08.223 --> 01:36:11.602
- Dismissed.
- Ten-hut!

01:36:17.691 --> 01:36:21.612
Good evening, general. I want to
report on a private poll I'm taking.

01:36:21.821 --> 01:36:22.864
What poll?

01:36:23.071 --> 01:36:24.239
The fan mail.

01:36:24.490 --> 01:36:27.286
Eleven percent con,
89 percent pro.

01:36:27.493 --> 01:36:32.038
And that 11% of protest, in most
cases, is both obscene and anonymous.

01:36:32.288 --> 01:36:36.002
But the pro letters are mostly from
relatives and servicemen.

01:36:36.210 --> 01:36:39.755
"I want you to know we're proud
our son is serving in your army.

01:36:40.004 --> 01:36:43.676
From the newspaper, we're not clear
exactly what you did and why...

01:36:44.136 --> 01:36:46.595
...but we want you to know
we're for you.

01:36:46.804 --> 01:36:48.639
Keep going, and God bless you."

01:36:49.307 --> 01:36:51.059
Keep going, huh?

01:36:51.267 --> 01:36:52.686
Where?

01:36:56.440 --> 01:37:00.733
I thought you might like a sip
of wine, general. Is New Year's.

01:37:00.944 --> 01:37:03.113
You didn't celebrate at all
last night.

01:37:10.868 --> 01:37:13.332
I'm sick of sitting around this...

01:37:13.582 --> 01:37:15.791
...royal doghouse.

01:37:15.999 --> 01:37:18.961
We've taken Sicily.
I'm ready for a new assignment.

01:37:19.628 --> 01:37:24.383
Maybe you've got it.
Here's a radio message, just came in.

01:37:28.887 --> 01:37:30.014
Cod.

01:37:31.223 --> 01:37:32.641
I've been relieved.

01:37:35.018 --> 01:37:37.939
They've relieved me from command
of the 7th Army.

01:37:38.773 --> 01:37:40.650
I don't believe it.

01:37:43.610 --> 01:37:44.653
Happy New Year.

01:37:51.077 --> 01:37:52.744
Just a minute, sir.

01:37:53.620 --> 01:37:56.332
Since they're sure to give you
another command...

01:37:56.539 --> 01:38:00.043
...isn't it logical they'd
relieve you here first?

01:38:01.211 --> 01:38:04.463
You mean command of all American
troops going into Europe?

01:38:04.673 --> 01:38:08.260
Is possible. I know is been
discussed from time to time.

01:38:08.511 --> 01:38:12.974
The logic of it is so obvious,
it couldn't mean anything else.

01:38:14.475 --> 01:38:19.021
Sir, I'm going to open
this bottle of wine.

01:38:19.437 --> 01:38:20.815
No, Sir Cod...

01:38:21.066 --> 01:38:24.651
...but if you find a bottle of cognac,
I'll help you drink it.

01:38:31.867 --> 01:38:35.745
- How you feeling tonight, general?
- Not bad, not bad at all.

01:38:35.955 --> 01:38:39.043
- Get me some writing paper, will you?
- Yes, sir.

01:38:39.791 --> 01:38:42.587
Your wife ever give you the devil
for not writing?

01:38:42.795 --> 01:38:44.213
All the time, sir.

01:38:44.422 --> 01:38:48.426
Only I don't write as often as you
do. Don't seem to get around to it.

01:38:49.300 --> 01:38:50.804
Lucky for us we got them.

01:38:51.804 --> 01:38:55.223
Who wants to marry a couple of
broken-down old horse captains?

01:38:55.431 --> 01:38:58.228
Thas what my wife says to me
every time I come home, sir.

01:38:59.395 --> 01:39:01.064
Why are you up so late, George?

01:39:01.271 --> 01:39:03.984
Thought you'd like a nice hot bath
or something.

01:39:12.032 --> 01:39:15.535
I got this sleeping pill from the doc,
just in case you need it.

01:39:16.827 --> 01:39:18.455
Sleeping pill!

01:39:18.996 --> 01:39:22.043
- Whas going on here?
- I heard the news, sir.

01:39:22.251 --> 01:39:25.546
- They announced it on the radio.
- What news?

01:39:26.421 --> 01:39:30.968
About General Bradley, sir. How they
gave him the top American command.

01:39:32.802 --> 01:39:34.096
Oh.

01:39:35.305 --> 01:39:36.598
Oh, yeah.

01:39:38.975 --> 01:39:42.227
I just thought you might be
feeling kind of low, sir.

01:39:59.204 --> 01:40:02.249
Your writing things, sir.
Here on the desk, sir.

01:40:02.876 --> 01:40:05.543
Yeah. Thank you, George.

01:40:07.962 --> 01:40:09.340
One little dog face.

01:40:09.591 --> 01:40:13.010
One measly little slap.
Thas what done it.

01:40:15.639 --> 01:40:17.682
Ah, George.

01:40:19.599 --> 01:40:22.477
I wish I'd kissed the son of a bitch.

01:43:51.241 --> 01:43:55.620
He's paying tribute to the Free French
Forces under DeGaulle and Leclerc.

01:44:11.891 --> 01:44:13.933
And to the people of the Resistance...

01:44:14.141 --> 01:44:17.145
...who risk their lives
to help destroy the Germans.

01:44:24.405 --> 01:44:27.117
"France will be free again.
I give you my word."

01:44:54.397 --> 01:44:58.525
"Just as Free French troops liberated
Corsica, Napoleon's place of birth...

01:44:58.777 --> 01:45:03.114
...I will someday land in France to
liberate the birthplace of Lafayette."

01:45:07.119 --> 01:45:10.415
General, the reporters would like
a word with you.

01:45:13.334 --> 01:45:15.255
- Good afternoon.
- General.

01:45:15.462 --> 01:45:18.505
Can you tell us the purpose
of this visit to Corsica?

01:45:18.716 --> 01:45:20.552
General Eisenhower ordered me here.

01:45:20.761 --> 01:45:25.139
You wrote the mother of the boy you
slapped, "The rat shoulďve been shot."

01:45:25.390 --> 01:45:27.726
- Is that true, general?
- No comment.

01:45:27.933 --> 01:45:30.438
Sir, I understand
Gen. Alexander suggested...

01:45:30.688 --> 01:45:33.609
...you take over Gen. Clark's
Italian campaign...

01:45:33.859 --> 01:45:36.111
...but it was killed
due to the incident.

01:45:36.362 --> 01:45:39.404
- No comment.
- Can you say where you're going, sir?

01:45:39.614 --> 01:45:42.451
Off the record,
Eisenhower's ordered me to Malta.

01:45:42.659 --> 01:45:43.788
Interview concluded.

01:45:43.995 --> 01:45:46.746
You plan on slapping
any soldiers there, general?

01:46:17.115 --> 01:46:20.536
PATTON: In 1528, these forts
were defended by...

01:46:20.788 --> 01:46:25.625
...400 Knights of Malta
and 800 mercenaries...

01:46:25.875 --> 01:46:30.298
...against a force of 40,000 Turks.

01:46:31.090 --> 01:46:32.383
Codman.

01:46:35.177 --> 01:46:38.225
- Still no word from Gen. Eisenhower?
- No, sir.

01:46:38.723 --> 01:46:42.394
Not even a response about
the two turkeys I sent for Christmas?

01:46:42.644 --> 01:46:44.061
No, sir.

01:46:44.940 --> 01:46:48.444
Go ahead, gentlemen.
Take a closer look for yourselves.

01:46:51.822 --> 01:46:56.161
Looks like you boys have hitched
your wagon to a falling star.

01:46:57.204 --> 01:47:00.248
Pass the word.
If anyone wants out, I'll understand.

01:47:00.456 --> 01:47:04.086
Sir, I can speak for the entire staff.

01:47:04.670 --> 01:47:08.883
We want to stay with you, no matter
what duty you're assigned to.

01:47:12.512 --> 01:47:15.766
Up in London, they're planning
the invasion of Europe.

01:47:17.852 --> 01:47:20.562
I've trained my mind,
body and spirit for that.

01:47:20.813 --> 01:47:23.276
What, in Goďs name, am I doing here?

01:47:25.652 --> 01:47:27.029
All right.

01:47:27.319 --> 01:47:29.323
Les get on to Cairo.

01:47:29.989 --> 01:47:32.452
See if the pyramids
are still standing.

01:48:54.086 --> 01:48:57.339
- This place is for me?
- Yes, sir. This way, sir.

01:48:58.632 --> 01:49:01.719
Whoever found it has a genius
for cloak and dagger.

01:49:19.740 --> 01:49:21.368
Who picked this cathouse?

01:49:21.619 --> 01:49:23.495
I think it was Gen. Smith, sir.

01:49:23.704 --> 01:49:25.706
To spite me, that son of a bitch.

01:49:25.916 --> 01:49:29.712
- Welcome to London, Georgie.
- Bedell. How are you?

01:49:29.918 --> 01:49:32.172
- Is Ike here?
- He asked me to brief you.

01:49:32.383 --> 01:49:34.258
Would you excuse us, please?

01:49:36.594 --> 01:49:38.638
Let me put you straight about Ike.

01:49:38.888 --> 01:49:42.184
We hear a lot about you
criticizing his decisions.

01:49:42.433 --> 01:49:45.478
Not really. You know me.
I'm just an old fool.

01:49:45.686 --> 01:49:48.816
At times, I do wonder whether
he isn't a limey at heart.

01:49:49.024 --> 01:49:52.820
George, this is the toughest coalition
ever attempted in history.

01:49:53.070 --> 01:49:57.200
Ike's trying to hold it together
and lick the Germans at the same time.

01:49:57.450 --> 01:49:59.494
- Is a hell of a job.
- I understand.

01:50:00.118 --> 01:50:04.083
You have an important assignment
connected to the Normandy invasion.

01:50:04.292 --> 01:50:08.547
Good. I've studied the Overlord Plan
and there's a number of flaws in it.

01:50:08.755 --> 01:50:13.509
You can't depend on Monty taking
Cannes by D-day. He'll never make it.

01:50:13.760 --> 01:50:16.847
I've drawn up an alternate plan
to land at Calais...

01:50:17.098 --> 01:50:21.395
...following an air bombardment-
- Will you just listen for a change?

01:50:21.645 --> 01:50:24.354
Ike stood by you when everyone,
I mean everyone...

01:50:24.605 --> 01:50:27.235
...wanted Patton
with a rope around his neck.

01:50:32.823 --> 01:50:36.619
We're gonna let it leak out
that you are here undercover.

01:50:36.828 --> 01:50:39.958
That you're preparing to invade
at the Pas de Calais.

01:50:40.165 --> 01:50:42.793
We hope to pin down
the German 15th Army there...

01:50:43.044 --> 01:50:45.881
...so that they can't be used
against us at Normandy.

01:50:46.255 --> 01:50:48.049
Is that all I'm good for?

01:50:48.259 --> 01:50:52.472
We're going to build an army
of 12 divisions around you.

01:50:52.722 --> 01:50:54.766
All fictitious, of course.

01:50:54.974 --> 01:50:57.896
Dummy troop concentrations,
dummy landing craft...

01:50:58.104 --> 01:51:00.396
...simulated radio traffic.

01:51:00.604 --> 01:51:05.236
The Germans are convinced that you
will lead the main invasion effort.

01:51:05.654 --> 01:51:07.574
Their agents will spot you soon...

01:51:07.781 --> 01:51:10.410
...then we can move you to Knutsford.

01:51:10.617 --> 01:51:13.913
- What do I do there?
- Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

01:51:15.081 --> 01:51:18.124
Frankly, George, you're on probation.

01:51:18.334 --> 01:51:20.420
Take my advice and behave yourself.

01:51:20.630 --> 01:51:22.089
Remember...

01:51:22.381 --> 01:51:25.424
...your worst enemy
is your own big mouth.

01:52:20.782 --> 01:52:24.284
Look at this nasty-faced
son of a bitch. Ready for combat.

01:52:24.495 --> 01:52:27.162
I'll call him William
as in "the Conqueror."

01:52:27.539 --> 01:52:31.460
- Sir, should we leave him in the car?
- No. Good afternoon, ladies.

01:52:31.710 --> 01:52:33.419
Good afternoon.

01:52:38.259 --> 01:52:39.885
Watch this, Cod.

01:52:40.177 --> 01:52:42.639
- Sir, he'll kill that dog.
- I'll hold him.

01:52:52.066 --> 01:52:55.946
I'm terribly sorry, general.
Did Abigail frighten your dog?

01:52:57.363 --> 01:52:59.282
Thas quite all right, madam.

01:53:00.159 --> 01:53:01.577
This way, sir.

01:53:03.829 --> 01:53:05.332
Your name isn't William.

01:53:06.332 --> 01:53:07.833
Is Willie.

01:53:10.838 --> 01:53:12.338
WOMAN:
My dear friends.

01:53:12.673 --> 01:53:16.927
General George S. Patton, Jr.,
has accepted our invitation...

01:53:17.178 --> 01:53:18.722
...to say a few words to you...

01:53:18.971 --> 01:53:21.726
...on the occasion
of this inaugural ceremony.

01:53:27.441 --> 01:53:31.110
General Patton is not here
in an official capacity...

01:53:31.487 --> 01:53:33.947
...and I have assured him
most earnestly...

01:53:34.197 --> 01:53:36.618
...that nothing he says
will be quoted.

01:53:39.997 --> 01:53:43.081
May I present General Patton.

01:53:54.347 --> 01:53:56.765
- Remember, sir, watch your language.
- Yeah.

01:53:57.265 --> 01:53:58.933
My dear ladies.

01:53:59.603 --> 01:54:01.437
Until today...

01:54:01.688 --> 01:54:06.818
...my only experience
at welcoming has been...

01:54:07.069 --> 01:54:12.198
...to welcome Germans and Italians
to the infernal region.

01:54:13.701 --> 01:54:16.288
At this I have been
quite successful...

01:54:16.497 --> 01:54:19.667
...since the troops, which I have had
the honor to command...

01:54:19.875 --> 01:54:22.503
...have, to date, killed or captured...

01:54:22.754 --> 01:54:26.340
...some 170,000 of our enemies.

01:54:35.101 --> 01:54:40.232
I feel that such clubs as these
are of very real value...

01:54:40.605 --> 01:54:43.444
...because I believe
with Mr. Bernard Shaw...

01:54:43.653 --> 01:54:47.365
...that the British and the Americans
are two peoples...

01:54:47.617 --> 01:54:51.284
...separated by a common language.

01:54:53.955 --> 01:54:59.002
Since it is the destiny of the British
and Americans to rule the world...

01:55:00.547 --> 01:55:02.549
...the better we know each other...

01:55:02.800 --> 01:55:04.633
...the better we will do it.

01:55:05.886 --> 01:55:08.390
The Russians,
don't forget the Russians.

01:55:08.806 --> 01:55:10.516
I think that a club like this...

01:55:10.766 --> 01:55:14.229
...is an ideal place
for promoting mutual understanding.

01:55:15.061 --> 01:55:20.487
Because as soon as our soldiers meet
and get to know the English ladies...

01:55:20.944 --> 01:55:26.325
...and write home and tell our women
just how lovely you truly are...

01:55:30.996 --> 01:55:33.960
...then the sooner the American ladies
will get jealous...

01:55:34.209 --> 01:55:37.129
...and force this war
to a quick termination.

01:55:41.219 --> 01:55:46.139
And then I'll get the chance to go
to the Pacific and kill Japanese.

01:56:04.787 --> 01:56:06.204
NARRATOR:
All over the nation...

01:56:06.454 --> 01:56:10.418
...mass meetings are held to protest
General Patton 's statement...

01:56:10.668 --> 01:56:13.461
...that Britain and America
will rule the post war world.

01:56:13.713 --> 01:56:15.633
That Russia will have no say.

01:56:15.840 --> 01:56:20.138
Congressional leaders like Senator
Clayburn Foss are quick to react.

01:56:20.388 --> 01:56:23.097
This man has insulted
our Russian allies...

01:56:23.348 --> 01:56:26.228
...implying Anglo-American world rule.

01:56:26.477 --> 01:56:29.564
In my opinion, he should be
severely disciplined.

01:56:29.897 --> 01:56:31.859
This time I didn't do a damn thing.

01:56:32.110 --> 01:56:34.780
They promised there
wouldn't be any reporters.

01:56:35.029 --> 01:56:37.281
I made a few remarks off the record.

01:56:37.489 --> 01:56:39.952
Ike told you to keep your mouth shut.

01:56:40.202 --> 01:56:43.997
You know how suspicious the Russians
are of the British and us.

01:56:44.205 --> 01:56:47.503
I was only trying to be polite
to the old ladies.

01:56:47.751 --> 01:56:53.175
If I'd seen the Russians there, I'd
have mentioned the sons of bitches.

01:56:53.508 --> 01:56:56.470
Bedell, I don't know
anything about politics.

01:56:56.720 --> 01:56:58.638
I have no political ambitions.

01:56:58.889 --> 01:57:01.892
All I want to do is
to command an army in combat.

01:57:02.143 --> 01:57:04.188
Well, is out of our hands now.

01:57:04.438 --> 01:57:07.733
Ike sent a message last night
to the chief of staff.

01:57:07.983 --> 01:57:13.156
Now is up to General Marshall
whether you stay here as a decoy...

01:57:13.405 --> 01:57:15.408
...or he sends you home.

01:57:17.911 --> 01:57:19.581
He's a good man.

01:57:20.080 --> 01:57:22.291
At least he's a fair man.

01:57:22.791 --> 01:57:24.585
I'll let it sit with him.

01:57:39.686 --> 01:57:41.062
PATTON:
George...

01:57:42.315 --> 01:57:44.609
...our war is over.

01:57:44.817 --> 01:57:46.068
Over, sir?

01:57:46.653 --> 01:57:50.034
Is just a question of waiting
for the orders now.

01:57:57.583 --> 01:57:59.418
I feel I'm...

01:58:01.086 --> 01:58:05.466
I'm destined to achieve some
great thing. What, I don't know.

01:58:07.218 --> 01:58:11.306
But this last incident is...

01:58:12.098 --> 01:58:16.104
...so trivial in its nature
and so terrible in its effect-

01:58:16.687 --> 01:58:20.275
It can't be an accident.
It has to be the work of God.

01:58:21.193 --> 01:58:22.567
Yes, sir.

01:58:23.236 --> 01:58:25.779
The last great opportunity
of a lifetime...

01:58:25.989 --> 01:58:30.492
...an entire world at war
and I'm left out of it?

01:58:30.745 --> 01:58:32.121
No, sir.

01:58:32.330 --> 01:58:34.415
God will not permit this to happen!

01:58:34.873 --> 01:58:39.464
I am going to be allowed
to fulfil my destiny!

01:58:44.426 --> 01:58:46.345
His will be done.

01:58:58.945 --> 01:59:02.489
NARRATOR: In the greatest amphibious
operation ever attempted...

01:59:02.696 --> 01:59:05.408
...a predawn naval bombardment
prepares the way...

01:59:05.618 --> 01:59:08.663
...for allied soldiers to assault
the Normandy beaches...

01:59:08.872 --> 01:59:12.460
...and claw out a desperate foothold
on the continent of Europe.

01:59:27.602 --> 01:59:32.858
I knew Montgomery couldn't take Caen
on D-day or D-plus-10. And I said so.

01:59:33.105 --> 01:59:37.030
And here they are all hung up
in the hedgerow country.

01:59:37.322 --> 01:59:41.409
They should pivot the way von
Schlieffen planned it in World War I.

01:59:42.325 --> 01:59:45.996
Then we might get a chance to do
some real broken field running.

01:59:46.997 --> 01:59:48.917
But they don't listen to me.

01:59:52.089 --> 01:59:54.590
What a way to enter
the continent of Europe.

01:59:54.839 --> 01:59:57.261
Along with all the rest
of the spare parts.

01:59:57.885 --> 02:00:00.595
Sir, everything on this plane
is high priority.

02:00:01.724 --> 02:00:05.520
Gen. Bradley wouldn't send for you
unless he had something in mind.

02:00:05.727 --> 02:00:09.357
I'll tell you, Cod.
I've learned my lesson.

02:00:09.983 --> 02:00:13.529
If I ever do get another chance,
I'm gonna keep my mouth shut.

02:00:15.364 --> 02:00:17.282
I'm gonna play the game.

02:00:17.743 --> 02:00:19.787
If I forget, you remind me.

02:00:20.535 --> 02:00:24.916
- I'll give a gentle nudge in the ribs.
- Give me a swift kick in the ass.

02:00:25.707 --> 02:00:27.001
Yes, sir.

02:00:48.819 --> 02:00:50.363
Welcome to France, sir.

02:00:50.570 --> 02:00:53.033
Hope the war's still on.
Where's the boss?

02:00:53.240 --> 02:00:54.491
Right this way, sir.

02:01:31.701 --> 02:01:35.289
Patton, haven't seen you
since Messina.

02:01:35.496 --> 02:01:36.539
How are you?

02:01:36.747 --> 02:01:39.502
You're doing a splendid job
decoying the Jerries.

02:01:39.709 --> 02:01:42.254
You'll forgive me,
I'm off to the front.

02:01:42.464 --> 02:01:44.257
Best of everything, old boy.

02:01:48.387 --> 02:01:49.889
By the way...

02:01:50.348 --> 02:01:53.809
...intelligence confirms
that I'm against Rommel again.

02:01:58.522 --> 02:01:59.900
Rommel.

02:02:01.860 --> 02:02:03.321
Hi, how are you, George?

02:02:04.236 --> 02:02:07.617
- Pretty fair, Brad. How are you?
- Fine.

02:02:11.454 --> 02:02:13.665
Well. My, my.

02:02:13.873 --> 02:02:15.584
Isn't this plush?

02:02:15.836 --> 02:02:18.795
Looks like you're
bucking for archbishop.

02:02:19.006 --> 02:02:22.300
Chet Hansen had this rig built for me.
George, sit down.

02:02:22.884 --> 02:02:26.848
Ike wanted me to talk to you
since we can level with each other.

02:02:27.098 --> 02:02:28.264
Thas right.

02:02:29.142 --> 02:02:33.064
We're making 3rd Army operational
when I take over 12th Army group.

02:02:33.272 --> 02:02:34.731
Do I get it?

02:02:35.357 --> 02:02:37.025
I'll be honest with you.

02:02:37.276 --> 02:02:38.945
I've had reservations.

02:02:39.778 --> 02:02:42.865
You've been my senior ever since
I left the academy.

02:02:43.117 --> 02:02:47.037
You were the boss in North Africa
and Sicily and I just thought...

02:02:48.330 --> 02:02:50.498
...well, it might be a problem for us.

02:02:51.041 --> 02:02:52.668
It wouldn't bother me.

02:02:52.876 --> 02:02:54.880
There's one other thing.

02:02:55.129 --> 02:02:57.090
We're different kinds of people.

02:02:57.339 --> 02:03:00.178
Goddamn it, Brad, you're always right.

02:03:00.385 --> 02:03:04.891
With your brains and my screwy ideas,
we make a great team, like in Sicily.

02:03:05.265 --> 02:03:09.564
Truthfully, if I had been your senior
in Sicily, I would have relieved you.

02:03:12.107 --> 02:03:13.317
Brad...

02:03:15.067 --> 02:03:17.780
...I'm not crawling on my belly
to get a command.

02:03:17.988 --> 02:03:20.618
For Goďs sake, get me in this fight.

02:03:22.243 --> 02:03:25.706
The only way out of the doghouse
is to do something great.

02:03:25.915 --> 02:03:27.582
I gotta get back in the war!

02:03:27.791 --> 02:03:31.003
Hitler's own people tried
to kill him a few days ago.

02:03:31.212 --> 02:03:33.549
First thing you know,
ill be over and...

02:03:36.927 --> 02:03:38.136
I'll...

02:03:40.473 --> 02:03:43.350
...keep my mouth shut.
I'll behave myself.

02:03:46.229 --> 02:03:47.941
I give you my word.

02:03:51.779 --> 02:03:53.153
George...

02:03:53.863 --> 02:03:56.492
...I've been working
on a plan called Cobra.

02:03:57.075 --> 02:03:58.744
I'd like your opinion.

02:03:58.951 --> 02:04:01.371
We've been slugging through
hedgerow country...

02:04:01.579 --> 02:04:04.749
...half an acre a day
and we've got to find a way out.

02:04:05.001 --> 02:04:06.544
I want to use this road.

02:04:06.752 --> 02:04:08.547
The Saint Lô-Periers road.

02:04:08.753 --> 02:04:11.466
Monty will pin down
the enemy forces at Caen.

02:04:11.675 --> 02:04:15.345
We'll pulverize an area
31/2 miles wide with bombing.

02:04:15.553 --> 02:04:17.556
Then seven divisions will follow.

02:04:17.806 --> 02:04:22.978
The 3rd Army will swing around here, a
sweeping end run right across France.

02:04:23.648 --> 02:04:25.022
What do you think?

02:04:26.318 --> 02:04:31.737
I think you'll need a screwball old
cavalryman to command the 3rd Army.

02:04:32.824 --> 02:04:34.452
George...

02:04:36.536 --> 02:04:41.335
...Ike came to that conclusion
in London three months ago.

02:04:41.919 --> 02:04:43.209
He what?

02:04:44.045 --> 02:04:48.259
Why, that dirty-!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

02:04:48.509 --> 02:04:50.512
I promise to keep my mouth shut.

02:06:47.143 --> 02:06:50.231
George could have the courtesy
to tell us where he's going.

02:07:03.411 --> 02:07:07.001
Good God, look at that.
Where you going, general?

02:07:07.293 --> 02:07:08.419
Berlin.

02:07:08.668 --> 02:07:12.549
I'm going to personally shoot
that paper-hanging son of a bitch.

02:07:53.929 --> 02:07:57.391
Hold it. Hold it!

02:07:58.517 --> 02:07:59.894
This place isn't on the map.

02:08:00.145 --> 02:08:03.020
You know why?
We've run clear off the map.

02:08:14.788 --> 02:08:17.330
Give George a headline,
and he's good for another 30 miles.

02:09:16.731 --> 02:09:18.734
SOLDIER:
Atten-hut!

02:09:19.735 --> 02:09:21.028
Hold it!

02:09:25.281 --> 02:09:28.954
Pay attention. We're gonna clean
this mess up right now.

02:09:29.246 --> 02:09:32.916
Les move this vehicle out this way.
This one out this way.

02:09:33.124 --> 02:09:36.046
Back that thing up there,
and we'll take this one here.

02:09:36.254 --> 02:09:38.759
All right, get up off your ass.
Les go now!

02:09:50.521 --> 02:09:52.354
Thas it.
Thas the way to move.

02:09:52.606 --> 02:09:55.442
Good boy. All right, come on.

02:09:55.734 --> 02:09:58.945
Come on, now. Here we go. Come on.
Thas it!

02:09:59.153 --> 02:10:01.074
Thas it! Gun it!

02:10:01.659 --> 02:10:03.577
Gun that thing!

02:10:03.868 --> 02:10:05.664
Okay, come on.

02:10:07.290 --> 02:10:08.582
Watch it!

02:10:09.292 --> 02:10:11.710
Go, go, go! Come on.
Hold it up.

02:10:11.962 --> 02:10:14.214
Come on, baby. Yeah, yeah.
Come on.

02:10:15.339 --> 02:10:16.926
Thas it.

02:10:17.551 --> 02:10:19.012
Come on, now.

02:10:21.597 --> 02:10:23.599
- Chet.
- Yeah, will do.

02:10:26.478 --> 02:10:30.148
Come on, keep coming. Keep coming.
Hold it up there.

02:10:33.026 --> 02:10:34.488
Now come on! Hold it!

02:10:34.736 --> 02:10:37.992
Hey, dummy, hold the fricking tank!

02:10:43.247 --> 02:10:44.706
Thas it. Come on.

02:10:44.957 --> 02:10:46.334
Good boy.

02:10:49.129 --> 02:10:50.754
- Hold it up there.
- General!

02:10:51.006 --> 02:10:53.340
General Bradley wants to have
a word with you.

02:10:53.593 --> 02:10:56.471
Okay. Come on!

02:10:57.637 --> 02:11:01.976
Okay. Hold it up. Take over.

02:11:09.526 --> 02:11:12.197
George, you'd make a good traffic cop.

02:11:13.948 --> 02:11:16.577
George this drive has been
magnificent...

02:11:16.826 --> 02:11:19.705
...but I'm sorry to say
I have to slow you down.

02:11:19.915 --> 02:11:24.084
- What the hell for?
- We'll have to cut off your supplies.

02:11:24.333 --> 02:11:28.132
Gasoline, ammunition, everything.
We're up against new priorities.

02:11:28.380 --> 02:11:32.011
- I think I smell Montgomery.
- Take it easy, George.

02:11:32.260 --> 02:11:35.264
There are serious issues involved.
Political issues.

02:11:35.516 --> 02:11:37.351
By God, it is Montgomery.

02:11:37.600 --> 02:11:41.521
The launching sites for the B-2 bombs
are all in his area.

02:11:41.772 --> 02:11:43.816
Churchill wants those bases destroyed.

02:11:44.275 --> 02:11:47.446
Hitler kills more civilians
in London than soldiers.

02:11:47.652 --> 02:11:49.365
Expect Montgomery to do anything?

02:11:50.115 --> 02:11:53.827
You give me gasoline and I'll gain
ground with it, kill Germans too.

02:11:54.079 --> 02:11:55.997
Give me 400,000 gallons.
I'll go to Berlin.

02:11:56.289 --> 02:11:57.876
George, I can't do it.

02:11:58.124 --> 02:12:00.044
The Siegfried line
is an empty shell.

02:12:00.293 --> 02:12:02.462
They stripped the equipment
and sent it east.

02:12:02.711 --> 02:12:05.507
Is crawling with cows.
I can punch through in two days.

02:12:05.759 --> 02:12:08.761
There's no use in arguing with me.
It wasn't my idea.

02:12:08.968 --> 02:12:11.015
Why did you pick me to command?

02:12:11.264 --> 02:12:13.305
I didn't pick you.

02:12:15.143 --> 02:12:16.645
Ike picked you.

02:12:20.025 --> 02:12:22.487
George, you have performed
brilliantly.

02:12:22.861 --> 02:12:24.612
You are loyal, dedicated.

02:12:24.863 --> 02:12:27.699
You're one of the best I've got,
but you don't know when to shut up.

02:12:27.949 --> 02:12:31.663
George, you're a pain in the neck.

02:12:35.376 --> 02:12:37.628
I have a lot of faults, Brad.

02:12:37.877 --> 02:12:40.339
But ingratitude isn't one of them.

02:12:40.590 --> 02:12:42.091
I owe you a lot.

02:12:43.260 --> 02:12:46.889
Hell, I know I'm a prima donna.
I admit it.

02:12:47.179 --> 02:12:50.432
What I can't stand about Monty is,
he won't admit it.

02:13:15.838 --> 02:13:19.049
Captain, the Bailey's run out of gas.

02:13:19.509 --> 02:13:21.303
The point tank has run out too.

02:13:22.972 --> 02:13:25.265
And there's a kraut column up ahead.

02:13:25.681 --> 02:13:27.142
Yeah, I know.

02:15:29.323 --> 02:15:31.244
PATTON:
Were you in command here, captain?

02:15:32.744 --> 02:15:33.829
I was in command.

02:15:34.830 --> 02:15:38.666
My tank platoon was supporting
an infantry company.

02:15:38.919 --> 02:15:43.756
Tanks ran out of gas,
so we had to fight it out.

02:15:45.259 --> 02:15:47.929
We started 11:00 last night.

02:15:49.347 --> 02:15:51.474
Finished a couple hours ago.

02:15:53.643 --> 02:15:58.148
This morning the fighting
was hand-to-hand.

02:16:46.536 --> 02:16:48.413
I had a dream last night.

02:16:50.624 --> 02:16:53.835
In my dream it came to me...

02:16:54.047 --> 02:16:57.382
...that right now the whole Nazi Reich
is mine for the taking.

02:16:57.592 --> 02:17:01.972
Think about that, Cod.
I was nearly sent home in disgrace.

02:17:02.680 --> 02:17:05.308
Now I have precisely
the right instrument...

02:17:05.516 --> 02:17:10.314
...at precisely the right moment of
history and exactly the right place.

02:17:10.607 --> 02:17:11.941
The Saar?

02:17:12.148 --> 02:17:14.277
This will change too, very quickly.

02:17:14.485 --> 02:17:17.111
Like a planet spinning off
into the universe.

02:17:17.364 --> 02:17:20.199
A moment like this won't come again
for 1000 years.

02:17:20.407 --> 02:17:23.243
All I need is a few
miserable gallons of gasoline.

02:17:23.621 --> 02:17:27.207
Right now, the weak spot is here.

02:17:28.751 --> 02:17:32.214
In 10 days, we could be in Berlin.

02:17:32.464 --> 02:17:35.966
What about the fortifications
that were done in Metz?

02:17:37.804 --> 02:17:39.973
Fixed fortifications, huh?

02:17:40.223 --> 02:17:43.267
Monuments to the stupidity of man.

02:17:44.061 --> 02:17:47.564
When mountain ranges and oceans
could be overcome...

02:17:47.815 --> 02:17:49.773
...anything built by man
can be overcome.

02:17:54.573 --> 02:17:57.243
You know how I'm sure
they're finished out there?

02:17:59.410 --> 02:18:00.788
The carts.

02:18:02.540 --> 02:18:05.791
They're using carts to move
their wounded and the supplies.

02:18:07.670 --> 02:18:11.635
The carts came to me in my dream.
I couldn't figure it out.

02:18:12.968 --> 02:18:14.763
Then I remembered...

02:18:16.596 --> 02:18:21.019
...that nightmare in the snow.
The agonizing retreat from Moscow.

02:18:21.894 --> 02:18:23.731
How cold it was.

02:18:27.151 --> 02:18:30.820
They threw the wounded and what was
left of the supplies in the carts.

02:18:32.074 --> 02:18:33.951
Napoleon was finished.

02:18:36.204 --> 02:18:38.956
Not any color left.
Not even the red of blood.

02:18:40.208 --> 02:18:41.877
Only the snow.

02:18:46.922 --> 02:18:48.342
Look at this, Cod.

02:18:56.059 --> 02:18:57.519
I love it.

02:19:01.522 --> 02:19:03.776
God help me, I do love it so.

02:19:07.906 --> 02:19:09.448
I love it more than my life.

02:19:18.669 --> 02:19:21.921
NARRATOR: Paris is liberated,
and French troops lead the way.

02:19:22.715 --> 02:19:27.429
The Allies march into the city
after four years of Nazi occupation.

02:19:27.846 --> 02:19:30.682
The hard-fighting French
2nd Armored Division...

02:19:30.891 --> 02:19:33.269
...under Major General
Jacques Leclerc...

02:19:33.477 --> 02:19:35.312
...gets an unforgettable welcome...

02:19:35.771 --> 02:19:37.857
...as they enter their beloved Paris.

02:19:42.948 --> 02:19:44.864
In a powerful drive to the north...

02:19:45.074 --> 02:19:48.661
...General Montgomery cuts off and
bypasses the French coastal towns...

02:19:48.911 --> 02:19:51.332
...of Boulogne, Calais and Dunkirk.

02:19:51.579 --> 02:19:54.835
Pushing on to capture the vital
Belgian port of Antwerp.

02:20:00.840 --> 02:20:02.592
Meanwhile, the main body
of Patton 's army...

02:20:02.802 --> 02:20:07.139
...resupplied now and rolling like a
juggernaut, slashes toward the Saar.

02:20:08.100 --> 02:20:10.145
Nazi resistance appears to crumble.

02:20:10.394 --> 02:20:15.108
It seems that nothing can stop our
troops from driving on into Germany.

02:20:23.867 --> 02:20:26.997
- Sir, General Bradley on your line.
- Good, good.

02:20:33.129 --> 02:20:35.881
Brad, listen, I've got a bridgehead
across the Saar.

02:20:36.132 --> 02:20:37.301
I'm on my way to Germany.

02:20:37.592 --> 02:20:40.176
Wait a minute, George.
There's a lot of trouble up north.

02:20:40.428 --> 02:20:45.559
I want you to transfer tank armor
to Middleton's 8th Corps right away.

02:20:45.976 --> 02:20:47.521
Brad, you can't do that.

02:20:47.895 --> 02:20:50.857
George, listen.
I don't have time to argue.

02:20:51.107 --> 02:20:53.902
There's a lot of enemy activity
up around Ardennes.

02:20:54.194 --> 02:20:56.446
No, I don't know how serious it is...

02:20:56.696 --> 02:21:01.202
...but Ike wants us to meet
with Bedell Smith tomorrow at Verdun.

02:21:01.452 --> 02:21:02.662
Be there at 1100.

02:21:03.163 --> 02:21:04.538
Yes, sir.

02:21:45.504 --> 02:21:48.338
PATTON: There's absolutely no reason
for us to assume...

02:21:48.548 --> 02:21:51.261
...that the Germans are mounting
a major offense.

02:21:52.553 --> 02:21:56.683
The weather is awful
and their supplies are low.

02:21:57.600 --> 02:22:01.313
The Germans haven't mounted a winter
attack since Frederick the Great.

02:22:04.023 --> 02:22:07.195
Therefore I believe thas exactly
what they're going to do.

02:22:49.034 --> 02:22:51.953
I want you to start making
contingency plans...

02:22:52.204 --> 02:22:53.915
...for pulling out
of our eastward attack.

02:22:54.290 --> 02:22:57.084
Changing directions 90 degrees,
moving up to Luxembourg.

02:22:58.876 --> 02:23:00.714
Don't look so stunned, gentlemen.

02:23:01.423 --> 02:23:04.050
I want you to plan
for three possible axes of attack.

02:23:04.260 --> 02:23:06.178
From Diekirch, due north.

02:23:06.430 --> 02:23:10.726
From Orléans to Bastogne.

02:23:10.934 --> 02:23:14.478
From Neufchâteau against the German
left flank.

02:23:34.793 --> 02:23:37.131
We've identified four German armies:

02:23:37.379 --> 02:23:42.385
The 7th, the 5th Panzer,
6th SS Panzer and the 15th.

02:23:42.930 --> 02:23:44.931
They've hit us with 26 divisions.

02:23:45.181 --> 02:23:48.060
They've overran two regimens
of the 106th Division.

02:23:48.308 --> 02:23:51.395
And 7500 of our men
were forced to surrender.

02:23:51.772 --> 02:23:54.318
Our concern is that von Rundstedt...

02:23:54.525 --> 02:23:58.488
...has the 101 st Airborne trapped
here at Bastogne.

02:24:01.408 --> 02:24:05.579
Bastogne, by the way, is the key
to this entire area.

02:24:06.372 --> 02:24:10.168
If we can hold it, we can break up
the entire German offensive.

02:24:10.794 --> 02:24:13.505
If they take it,
we're in serious trouble.

02:24:14.631 --> 02:24:17.009
Ike wants to know if anybody can go...

02:24:17.218 --> 02:24:20.472
...and relieve the 101 st
before they're torn to pieces.

02:24:22.723 --> 02:24:25.060
There's nothing Montgomery can do.

02:24:25.309 --> 02:24:27.688
At any rate, not for some weeks.

02:24:28.395 --> 02:24:30.399
What about you, George?

02:24:31.318 --> 02:24:33.735
I can attack with three divisions
in 48 hours.

02:24:37.738 --> 02:24:39.368
I'd give myself some leeway.

02:24:39.951 --> 02:24:42.078
Ike wants a realistic estimate,
George.

02:24:42.330 --> 02:24:46.460
You're in the middle of a fight now.
Is over a hundred miles to Bastogne.

02:24:46.710 --> 02:24:49.046
My staff's already working
out the details.

02:24:51.338 --> 02:24:54.385
Frankly, I don't see how
is possible.

02:24:54.846 --> 02:24:56.888
Not in this kind of weather.

02:24:57.515 --> 02:25:00.348
I should have thought you'd want
to fall back and regroup.

02:25:00.600 --> 02:25:03.354
Not me. I don't like to pay
for the same real estate twice.

02:25:03.604 --> 02:25:04.939
TEDDER:
But what about your men?

02:25:05.274 --> 02:25:09.569
You can't cart them off 100 miles,
expecting them to attack without rest.

02:25:09.987 --> 02:25:11.112
I trained these men.

02:25:11.364 --> 02:25:13.281
They'll do what I tell them to do.

02:25:13.532 --> 02:25:17.245
We hadn't realized you were
so popular with your troops, general.

02:25:18.577 --> 02:25:22.542
I'm not. They'll do it
because they're good soldiers.

02:25:22.791 --> 02:25:26.673
And because they realize, as I do,
that we can still lose this war.

02:25:29.926 --> 02:25:32.678
Then I think I can speak
for Field Marshal Montgomery.

02:25:33.552 --> 02:25:36.017
He'd say you're asking
the impossible of your men.

02:25:36.266 --> 02:25:37.809
Of course he would.

02:25:38.060 --> 02:25:41.314
Cause he's never realized thas
what we're in business for.

02:26:59.567 --> 02:27:02.032
General McAuliffe refused
a German surrender demand.

02:27:02.281 --> 02:27:03.908
You know what he said?

02:27:05.034 --> 02:27:06.287
What?

02:27:06.661 --> 02:27:08.288
He said, "Nuts."

02:27:10.497 --> 02:27:11.750
Keep them moving, colonel.

02:27:12.001 --> 02:27:14.336
A man that eloquent has to be saved.

02:29:32.577 --> 02:29:34.494
This is where it pays off.

02:29:34.872 --> 02:29:36.499
The training and discipline.

02:29:37.583 --> 02:29:39.709
No other outfit in the world.

02:29:40.420 --> 02:29:44.091
Pulled out of a winter battle,
move a hundred miles.

02:29:44.382 --> 02:29:48.471
Going to a major attack with no rest,
no sleep, no hot food.

02:29:48.680 --> 02:29:52.350
God! God, I'm proud of these men!

02:30:18.005 --> 02:30:22.135
Sir, von Rundsteds thrown another
panzer division against Bastogne.

02:30:22.383 --> 02:30:24.595
101 st Airborne's barely holding on.

02:30:24.804 --> 02:30:29.183
We need damned air cover. If we had
decent weather, we might make it.

02:30:29.643 --> 02:30:31.688
CARVER:
General Mason, sir.

02:30:46.288 --> 02:30:49.415
Hello, Mase?
Listen, we're short on foot soldiers.

02:30:49.665 --> 02:30:53.377
Cannibalize your antiaircraft units
and turn them into riflemen.

02:30:53.587 --> 02:30:55.464
Yes, every last one you can find.

02:30:55.716 --> 02:30:57.006
Good evening, general.

02:30:57.257 --> 02:31:00.469
I just got the weather report
for tomorrow. More snow.

02:31:00.720 --> 02:31:02.681
There goes our air cover.

02:31:02.932 --> 02:31:05.601
We may have to wait
for better weather.

02:31:05.847 --> 02:31:10.732
Brave men dying up there. I won't
wait, not an hour, not a minute.

02:31:13.065 --> 02:31:14.485
Going to keep moving.

02:31:14.735 --> 02:31:16.529
Is that clear?

02:31:18.616 --> 02:31:22.162
We're going to attack all night
and attack tomorrow morning!

02:31:23.204 --> 02:31:25.497
If we're not victorious...

02:31:27.793 --> 02:31:29.793
...let no one come back alive.

02:31:41.557 --> 02:31:43.268
You know something, general?

02:31:43.519 --> 02:31:47.816
Sometimes, they can't tell when
you're acting and when you're not.

02:31:49.566 --> 02:31:51.777
It isn't important for them to know.

02:31:53.320 --> 02:31:55.532
Is only important for me to know.

02:32:02.582 --> 02:32:05.962
- You want to see me, general?
- Oh, yeah, chaplain.

02:32:06.168 --> 02:32:08.796
I'm tired of 3rd Army
having to fight Germans...

02:32:09.047 --> 02:32:11.383
...with supreme command,
no gasoline...

02:32:11.593 --> 02:32:13.592
...and now this ungodly weather.

02:32:13.845 --> 02:32:15.931
I want a prayer, a weather prayer.

02:32:16.975 --> 02:32:18.308
A weather prayer, sir?

02:32:18.559 --> 02:32:21.603
Yes, les see if you can't get God
working with us.

02:32:21.854 --> 02:32:24.316
Gonna take a thick rug
for that kind of praying.

02:32:24.565 --> 02:32:26.820
I don't care if it
takes a flying carpet.

02:32:27.026 --> 02:32:29.946
I don't know how this
will be received, general.

02:32:30.196 --> 02:32:33.118
Praying for good weather
so we can kill our fellow man.

02:32:33.366 --> 02:32:36.495
I assure you, because of
my relations with the Almighty...

02:32:36.745 --> 02:32:39.958
...if you write a good prayer,
we'll have good weather.

02:32:40.249 --> 02:32:42.878
And I expect that prayer
within an hour.

02:32:43.671 --> 02:32:44.963
Yes, sir.

02:33:15.623 --> 02:33:18.544
"Almighty and most merciful Father...

02:33:19.462 --> 02:33:21.922
...we humbly beseech Thee...

02:33:22.173 --> 02:33:24.382
...of Thy great goodness...

02:33:25.303 --> 02:33:28.762
...to restrain this
immoderate weather...

02:33:30.016 --> 02:33:32.309
...with which we've had to contend.

02:33:34.478 --> 02:33:37.316
Grant us fair weather for battle.

02:33:38.441 --> 02:33:40.233
Graciously hearken to us...

02:33:41.362 --> 02:33:43.573
...as soldiers who call upon Thee...

02:33:44.073 --> 02:33:46.534
...that armed with Thy power...

02:33:46.908 --> 02:33:49.872
...we may advance
from victory to victory...

02:33:50.079 --> 02:33:52.458
...and crush the oppression...

02:33:52.707 --> 02:33:55.253
...and wickedness of our enemies...

02:33:55.460 --> 02:33:57.754
...and establish Thy justice...

02:33:58.589 --> 02:34:01.925
...among men and nations.

02:34:05.305 --> 02:34:06.557
Amen."

02:34:21.990 --> 02:34:23.451
Weather's perfect.

02:34:24.744 --> 02:34:27.581
Cod, get me that chaplain.

02:34:27.832 --> 02:34:30.835
He's in good with the Lord
and I want to decorate him.

02:34:58.449 --> 02:35:00.826
Hiya, general!

02:35:38.704 --> 02:35:41.331
NARRATOR: Supported by medium bombers
and fighter bombers...

02:35:41.582 --> 02:35:44.126
...flying sorties
against German positions...

02:35:44.377 --> 02:35:46.004
...elements of the 3rd Army...

02:35:46.211 --> 02:35:48.797
...spearheaded by the
4th Armored Division...

02:35:49.049 --> 02:35:50.591
...drive into Bastogne...

02:35:50.800 --> 02:35:53.304
...to relieve its 18,000 defenders...

02:35:53.511 --> 02:35:55.181
...on the day after Christmas.

02:35:56.308 --> 02:35:59.603
During this operation,
3rd Army moved farther and faster...

02:35:59.852 --> 02:36:02.271
...and engaged more divisions
in less time...

02:36:02.522 --> 02:36:06.235
...than any other army in the history
of the United States.

02:39:21.958 --> 02:39:23.585
Excuse me, sir.

02:39:23.835 --> 02:39:26.587
General Katkov would like to know
if you'll join him...

02:39:26.839 --> 02:39:29.591
...to drink to the surrender
of Germany.

02:39:29.883 --> 02:39:32.220
My compliments to the general.

02:39:32.470 --> 02:39:35.640
Please inform him that I do not care
to drink with him...

02:39:35.848 --> 02:39:38.560
...or any other Russian
son of a bitch.

02:39:39.061 --> 02:39:41.272
Sir...

02:39:41.482 --> 02:39:43.315
...I cannot tell the general that.

02:39:44.776 --> 02:39:46.277
You tell him that.

02:39:46.570 --> 02:39:48.154
Tell him word for word.

02:40:10.430 --> 02:40:13.183
The general says he thinks that...

02:40:13.432 --> 02:40:15.310
...you are a son of a bitch too.

02:40:20.899 --> 02:40:23.946
Okay. I'll drink to that.

02:40:24.197 --> 02:40:25.946
One son of a bitch to another.

02:41:08.496 --> 02:41:10.875
Is it true that Roosevelt,
before he died...

02:41:11.125 --> 02:41:13.295
...promised you
a command in the Pacific?

02:41:13.545 --> 02:41:18.298
Yes. But now that he's gone, I don't
think there's much chance of that.

02:41:18.550 --> 02:41:20.762
Doug MacArthur
doesn't want me up there.

02:41:20.968 --> 02:41:24.138
We're told of "wonder weapons"
the Germans were working on:

02:41:24.388 --> 02:41:26.851
Long-range rockets,
push-button bombing...

02:41:27.102 --> 02:41:29.519
...weapons that don't need soldiers.

02:41:29.812 --> 02:41:31.190
"Wonder weapon"?

02:41:32.108 --> 02:41:34.568
My God, I don't see
the wonder in them.

02:41:35.152 --> 02:41:39.323
Killing without heroics. Nothing
is glorified, nothing is reaffirmed.

02:41:39.947 --> 02:41:43.496
No heroes, no cowards, no troops.

02:41:43.746 --> 02:41:45.371
No generals.

02:41:46.081 --> 02:41:49.336
Only those that are left alive
and those that are left...

02:41:49.628 --> 02:41:51.004
...dead.

02:41:51.419 --> 02:41:53.296
I'm glad I won't live to see it.

02:41:53.505 --> 02:41:57.178
REPORTER: Is said you're still
using former Nazis in key positions.

02:41:57.427 --> 02:41:59.597
Despite the denazification policy.

02:41:59.846 --> 02:42:02.891
Well, if I'm supplied
with trained personnel...

02:42:03.100 --> 02:42:04.769
...I'll get rid of the Nazis.

02:42:05.019 --> 02:42:08.982
Until then, I'll use them to keep
the railroads and telephones working.

02:42:09.232 --> 02:42:12.486
After all, didn't most
ordinary Nazis join the Party...

02:42:12.737 --> 02:42:17.074
...in about the same way Americans
become Republicans or Democrats?

02:42:17.450 --> 02:42:18.868
Yes, thas about it.

02:42:22.290 --> 02:42:26.959
You agree that national policy be made
by civilians, not by the military?

02:42:27.546 --> 02:42:30.549
Of course. But the politicians
never let us finish.

02:42:30.800 --> 02:42:33.968
They always stop short and leave us
with another war.

02:42:34.762 --> 02:42:37.097
You thinking about our Russian allies?

02:42:42.063 --> 02:42:46.068
Did you say if you found your army
between the Germans and the Russians...

02:42:46.318 --> 02:42:48.195
...you'd attack in both directions?

02:42:48.443 --> 02:42:50.654
No, I never said that.

02:42:51.448 --> 02:42:53.157
I never said any such thing.

02:42:53.782 --> 02:42:55.368
But I wish I had.

02:43:09.927 --> 02:43:14.015
Sir, there's a call on your line from
supreme headquarters, General Smith.

02:43:19.479 --> 02:43:20.440
Bedell?

02:43:20.982 --> 02:43:22.775
Ike is furious.

02:43:23.024 --> 02:43:27.612
How could you compare Republicans
and Democrats to the Nazi Party?

02:43:27.862 --> 02:43:29.992
And the statement
that you refuse to denazify...

02:43:30.242 --> 02:43:32.995
...has the Russians, the British,
everybody, screaming.

02:43:33.410 --> 02:43:36.124
Well, the hell
with the Mongoloid Russians.

02:43:36.332 --> 02:43:39.377
We've given them Berlin, Prague,
God knows what else.

02:43:39.628 --> 02:43:41.463
They gonna dictate policy too?

02:43:41.713 --> 02:43:43.881
George, don't be a fool.

02:43:44.131 --> 02:43:47.428
The war in Europe is over.
Washington dictates policy.

02:43:47.680 --> 02:43:52.100
The war shouldn't be over. We should
stop pussyfooting about the Russians!

02:43:52.350 --> 02:43:56.231
We'll have to fight them anyway. Why
not do it now, when the army's here?

02:43:56.729 --> 02:44:00.402
Instead of disarming Germans les
get them to help fight the Bolsheviks.

02:44:00.943 --> 02:44:03.362
You better shut up.
This line may be tapped.

02:44:03.614 --> 02:44:05.323
I don't care. I'll tell you...

02:44:05.575 --> 02:44:07.660
...we've been fighting
the wrong people.

02:44:07.909 --> 02:44:11.371
You and I don't have to get involved,
you're so soft about it.

02:44:11.622 --> 02:44:14.919
Leave it to me. In 10 days
I'll have us at war with them...

02:44:15.166 --> 02:44:17.047
...and make it look like their fault!

02:44:17.503 --> 02:44:20.755
George, you're mad.
You're absolutely out of your mind!

02:44:21.007 --> 02:44:22.677
Well, I'm no diplomat.

02:44:22.929 --> 02:44:25.596
I'm a combat soldier.
Thas all they understand.

02:44:25.845 --> 02:44:29.602
Get Ike to give me the word,
and I'll kick them back to Russia!

02:44:39.195 --> 02:44:41.406
Shall I call the artist back, sir?

02:44:43.075 --> 02:44:45.162
Oh, the hell with it.

02:44:46.828 --> 02:44:50.374
Nobody wants to see a picture of me.
I'm mad!

02:44:51.334 --> 02:44:52.878
Don't you know that?

02:45:40.014 --> 02:45:42.976
Field Marshal Montgomery,
his majesty is prepared...

02:45:43.226 --> 02:45:46.689
...to receive the next chief
of the imperial general staff.

02:45:59.703 --> 02:46:01.289
Thank you.

02:46:02.207 --> 02:46:03.791
Thank you.

02:46:04.502 --> 02:46:06.085
Take care of yourself.

02:46:06.295 --> 02:46:07.546
George.

02:46:20.728 --> 02:46:23.605
Well, gentlemen...

02:46:25.318 --> 02:46:28.610
...all good things
must come to an end.

02:46:30.989 --> 02:46:33.826
And the best thing
thas happened to me...

02:46:34.743 --> 02:46:36.329
...in my life...

02:46:38.246 --> 02:46:40.291
...has been...

02:46:43.294 --> 02:46:44.671
...uh...

02:46:45.462 --> 02:46:47.176
...the honor...

02:46:47.675 --> 02:46:50.718
...and privilege...

02:46:52.930 --> 02:46:55.100
...of commanding the 3rd Army.

02:46:57.895 --> 02:46:59.188
Goodbye...

02:47:00.398 --> 02:47:01.983
...and God bless you.

02:47:28.639 --> 02:47:30.556
Brad...

02:47:30.850 --> 02:47:33.394
...they've taken the 3rd Army
away from me.

02:47:33.644 --> 02:47:34.897
I know.

02:47:35.563 --> 02:47:38.482
I thought we could have dinner
together tonight.

02:47:40.194 --> 02:47:43.198
Thank you, Brad.

02:47:43.447 --> 02:47:45.783
Thas damn thoughtful.
I appreciate it.

02:47:53.166 --> 02:47:55.713
Right now, I think I'll take
Willie for a walk.

02:48:03.095 --> 02:48:04.971
George, look out!

02:48:12.482 --> 02:48:14.900
After all I've been through...

02:48:15.149 --> 02:48:17.778
...imagine getting killed
by an oxcart.

02:48:19.238 --> 02:48:23.869
No, Brad, there's only one proper way
for a professional soldier to die.

02:48:24.118 --> 02:48:28.124
Thas from the last bullet
of the last battle of the last war.

02:48:29.209 --> 02:48:32.503
At least the 3rd Army earned its pay.

02:48:33.380 --> 02:48:36.047
In our drive across Europe,
we liberated...

02:48:36.299 --> 02:48:38.343
...12,000 cities and towns...

02:48:38.554 --> 02:48:41.430
...and inflicted a million and a half
enemy casualties.

02:48:41.681 --> 02:48:45.434
I sense from now on, just being
a good soldier won't mean a thing.

02:48:45.684 --> 02:48:50.482
I'm afraid we're gonna have to be
diplomats, administrators, you name it.

02:48:50.732 --> 02:48:52.317
God help us.

02:48:57.533 --> 02:49:00.660
George, I want to say one thing.

02:49:01.995 --> 02:49:04.832
You've done a magnificent job
here in Europe.

02:49:05.543 --> 02:49:07.044
Thas right, George.

02:49:07.835 --> 02:49:12.966
That soldier you slapped did more to
win the war than any other private.

02:49:16.054 --> 02:49:17.763
I'll see you for dinner.

02:49:18.139 --> 02:49:19.640
Six-thirty?

02:49:36.118 --> 02:49:37.912
PATTON:
For over a thousand years...

02:49:38.162 --> 02:49:41.165
...Roman conquerors
returning from the wars...

02:49:41.415 --> 02:49:46.129
...enjoyed the honor of a triumph,
a tumultuous parade.

02:49:46.962 --> 02:49:51.051
In the procession came trumpeters
and musicians and strange animals...

02:49:51.301 --> 02:49:53.220
...from the conquered territories...

02:49:54.096 --> 02:49:58.224
...together with carts laden with
treasure and captured armaments.

02:49:59.476 --> 02:50:03.023
The conqueror rode
in a triumphal chariot...

02:50:03.274 --> 02:50:06.569
...the dazed prisoners
walking in chains before him.

02:50:07.486 --> 02:50:10.240
Sometimes, his children,
robed in white...

02:50:10.490 --> 02:50:14.034
...stood with him in the chariot,
or rode the trace horses.

02:50:15.120 --> 02:50:18.081
A slave stood behind the conqueror...

02:50:18.330 --> 02:50:20.963
...holding a golden crown...

02:50:21.671 --> 02:50:24.505
...and whispering in his ear
a warning...

02:50:25.089 --> 02:50:27.009
...that all glory...

02:50:27.508 --> 02:50:29.346
...is fleeting.
