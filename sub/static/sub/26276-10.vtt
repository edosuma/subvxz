WEBVTT

00:08.095 --> 00:09.183
[distorted]:
Get down.

00:10.575 --> 00:11.837
I said down!

00:11.881 --> 00:13.491
Get down. Come on, let's go!
Come on!

00:13.535 --> 00:14.492
Get down. Faster!

00:14.536 --> 00:16.277
You, move.

00:16.320 --> 00:17.974
Keep those hands up!MAN: Take it, take it all.

00:18.018 --> 00:20.411
Okay, everything
goes in the bag.

00:20.455 --> 00:22.065
Watches, phones, jewelry.

00:22.109 --> 00:24.111
Faster! Come on, let's move.
All of it!

00:24.154 --> 00:25.416
Get those earrings off, lady.

00:25.460 --> 00:27.636
In there now. Come on, hurry!

00:27.679 --> 00:29.725
In there, now!

00:29.768 --> 00:30.726
We good?

00:30.769 --> 00:33.381
You, poker lady.

00:33.424 --> 00:34.382
Get up now.

00:34.425 --> 00:36.601
It's okay.

00:36.645 --> 00:39.952
I said get up. Faster.

00:42.216 --> 00:43.739
Faster.

00:43.782 --> 00:44.740
Let me help her.
Let me help her, man.

00:44.783 --> 00:46.481
Stay where you are.

00:50.789 --> 00:52.661
The safe. Open it.

00:53.792 --> 00:56.099
Now!
Please.

00:56.143 --> 00:58.058
I'm not gonna
tell you again.

00:59.015 --> 01:00.190
[woman screams]

01:04.586 --> 01:06.849
You picked a bad day
to be a hero, pal.

01:08.894 --> 01:10.809
â™ª

01:29.176 --> 01:30.481
MAGNUM:
It's not like Rick

01:30.525 --> 01:31.787
to call
in the middle of the night,

01:31.830 --> 01:33.441
so I knew right away
it was bad.

01:33.484 --> 01:34.877
Now, I don't have
all the details,

01:34.920 --> 01:36.400
but I guess his friend Toni

01:36.444 --> 01:37.445
was looking to put together
some quick cash

01:37.488 --> 01:39.447
to help out her sick brother.

01:39.490 --> 01:41.449
Enter Rick,
who was able to rope in

01:41.492 --> 01:43.059
some whales for a card game.

01:43.103 --> 01:45.366
The only problem is
the game got hit.

01:45.409 --> 01:48.108
The whole situation makes me
think of that old saying:

01:48.151 --> 01:50.501
no good deed goes unpunished.

01:50.545 --> 01:52.416
Toni.Hey, thanks for coming.

01:52.460 --> 01:54.288
Of course. You all right?

01:54.331 --> 01:56.116
Yeah. Little shook up.Yeah.

01:56.159 --> 01:57.943
Hey, buddy.

01:57.987 --> 01:59.771
How you doing?[groans]

01:59.815 --> 02:01.773
You know, I'll live.

02:01.817 --> 02:03.514
Do you think

02:03.558 --> 02:04.994
maybe you could see
if there's some fresh ice

02:05.037 --> 02:07.127
in the machine
down the hall?

02:07.170 --> 02:09.999
Is that code for wanting
some privacy with Thomas?

02:10.042 --> 02:11.305
Yeah.

02:11.348 --> 02:13.785
Fresh ice, coming right up.

02:13.829 --> 02:15.744
Thanks, Toni.

02:18.181 --> 02:19.226
What?

02:19.269 --> 02:20.618
There a little thing going on?

02:20.662 --> 02:22.446
Come on. Relax.

02:22.490 --> 02:23.578
I'm supposed to be
your best friend.

02:23.621 --> 02:25.232
You weren't gonna
tell me anything?

02:25.275 --> 02:26.972
Look, there's nothing to tell,
all right?

02:27.016 --> 02:29.714
I like her, yes.
I'm just being careful.

02:29.758 --> 02:32.108
I mean, it's different when
you have feelings for a friend.

02:33.457 --> 02:35.459
I get it.

02:35.503 --> 02:38.636
So, you want to tell
me what happened?

02:38.680 --> 02:40.116
Uh...

02:40.160 --> 02:41.683
Like I told you,

02:41.726 --> 02:43.467
Toni got behind
on her brother's medical bills,

02:43.511 --> 02:45.469
so I helped her put together
a little game.

02:45.513 --> 02:47.471
A no-limit Texas hold 'em

02:47.515 --> 02:49.299
with the highest rollers
I could find.

02:49.343 --> 02:51.345
Guy Hagi was here.

02:51.388 --> 02:53.521
Meghan Lou,
this ranching heiress.

02:53.564 --> 02:56.393
Uh, there was this
hedge fund guy from New York,

02:56.437 --> 02:59.483
uh, Bert Lyons.

02:59.527 --> 03:01.659
This big-shot
local business guy,

03:01.703 --> 03:03.922
Russell Chang. Loves to gamble.

03:03.966 --> 03:05.794
And finally, Pascale.

03:05.837 --> 03:08.231
MAGNUM:
Wait, uh, Pascale Parata?

03:08.275 --> 03:11.016
The O.G. crime boss himself.

03:11.060 --> 03:13.802
Now, the buy-in was 15K,

03:13.845 --> 03:16.413
and Toni was taking a rake,
five percent of each pot.

03:16.457 --> 03:19.329
A rake.
So the game wasn't exactly...

03:19.373 --> 03:22.245
Legal, no,
but it was for a good cause.

03:22.289 --> 03:25.335
Now, we were about four hours in
when it happened.

03:25.379 --> 03:27.772
There was a lot
of rebuys happening,

03:27.816 --> 03:29.818
so there was a ton of cash
on the table.

03:31.646 --> 03:32.995
This is amazing.

03:33.038 --> 03:36.216
Bert Lyons just rebought for 30k
and didn't blink.

03:36.259 --> 03:37.608
Well, that's chump change
for him.

03:37.652 --> 03:39.436
Chump change for all of 'em,
actually.

03:39.480 --> 03:41.264
But not for you.

03:41.308 --> 03:43.397
You didn't have to play,
you know.

03:43.440 --> 03:45.225
Well, these guys
wouldn't have shown up

03:45.268 --> 03:46.356
unless there were six people.

03:46.400 --> 03:48.967
Yeah, but what if you lose?

03:49.011 --> 03:52.057
No, listen, I'm playing smart.
I'm up 5K.

03:52.101 --> 03:54.582
Do you realize how many
dinners for two that is?

03:54.625 --> 03:56.758
I do.

03:56.801 --> 03:58.673
If only I had somebody
to go with me

03:58.716 --> 04:02.024
to one of those dinners
or all of those dinners or...

04:02.067 --> 04:03.808
I can think of someone.

04:03.852 --> 04:05.462
[knock on door]

04:05.506 --> 04:07.464
You expecting someone else?

04:07.508 --> 04:08.813
No.

04:08.857 --> 04:10.467
[groans]

04:10.511 --> 04:12.469
Nobody move!

04:12.513 --> 04:13.601
Nobody move!

04:13.644 --> 04:15.342
RICK: It's okay. It's okay.Get back.

04:15.385 --> 04:17.387
Rick?

04:17.431 --> 04:18.475
Hands up high
where I can see them.

04:18.519 --> 04:19.650
Everyone

04:19.694 --> 04:21.391
around the table and
down on your knees.

04:21.435 --> 04:22.827
Move. Let's go, let's go.

04:22.871 --> 04:25.308
Get down!

04:25.352 --> 04:26.396
Everything goes in the bag.

04:26.440 --> 04:27.963
Watches,
phones, jewelry.

04:28.006 --> 04:29.051
Keys, everything.

04:29.094 --> 04:30.487
Faster.

04:30.531 --> 04:31.967
RICK:
They wanted everything.

04:32.010 --> 04:35.187
You know, uh,
wallets, phones, keys.

04:35.231 --> 04:37.015
Then they wanted
to get in the safe.

04:37.059 --> 04:40.584
Toni froze,
so they kept on pressing her.

04:40.628 --> 04:42.847
And that's when
you jumped in and...

04:42.891 --> 04:43.848
Yeah.

04:43.892 --> 04:45.285
How much money was in the safe?

04:45.328 --> 04:47.330
260 thou.

04:47.374 --> 04:48.940
Ouf.

04:48.984 --> 04:51.116
Look, Thomas, I need your help.

04:51.160 --> 04:53.249
All right,
I-I got to get that money back,

04:53.293 --> 04:56.121
but I can't call the cops
because it was an illegal game.

04:56.165 --> 04:58.385
Forget the money.
Nobody got hurt.

04:58.428 --> 05:01.953
Right? You just got to know
when to fold 'em

05:01.997 --> 05:04.260
and figure out another way
to help Toni.

05:04.304 --> 05:07.002
You don't understand.
Toni was the bank.

05:07.045 --> 05:10.179
Now she's got to cover
those losses. Right now

05:10.222 --> 05:12.007
most of the players,
they're willing to take a credit

05:12.050 --> 05:13.661
for the next time they play.

05:13.704 --> 05:17.273
But not the guy who was up.
He wants to be paid in full.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.580
And who was that?That's the problem.

05:19.623 --> 05:21.799
It was Pascale Parata.

05:21.843 --> 05:23.540
The crime boss, perfect.

05:23.584 --> 05:26.282
Uh, how much was he up?

05:26.326 --> 05:28.240
170.

05:28.284 --> 05:31.374
Now, before he left,
he gave a deadline

05:31.418 --> 05:32.810
for Toni to square up.

05:32.854 --> 05:34.856
He wants the cash
by tomorrow afternoon.

05:37.772 --> 05:39.730
Pascale, he is not one
to make idle threats.

05:39.774 --> 05:41.950
He is dead serious about this.

05:43.081 --> 05:45.519
Well...

05:45.562 --> 05:47.390
let's go find the money.

06:13.155 --> 06:14.417
What happened to you?

06:14.461 --> 06:16.332
Coconut fall on your head?

06:16.376 --> 06:18.203
Is it really that bad?Actually, it's an improvement.

06:21.337 --> 06:23.165
I wasn't expecting you
until next week,

06:23.208 --> 06:24.949
so this has to be serious.

06:24.993 --> 06:27.996
Yeah. Got myself
in a bit of a bind.

06:28.039 --> 06:29.954
What's her name?

06:29.998 --> 06:31.216
Toni.

06:31.260 --> 06:34.089
Tell me.

06:34.132 --> 06:35.960
Well, last night
she's hosting a poker game.

06:36.004 --> 06:38.485
I offered to help.
Brought in a couple whales.

06:38.528 --> 06:41.662
About halfway through, two mutts
kick in the door and rob it.

06:41.705 --> 06:45.317
Now, the problem is
Toni is the bank,

06:45.361 --> 06:47.145
so she's on the hook to the guy
who was in the lead.

06:47.189 --> 06:48.233
And who's that?

06:48.277 --> 06:50.410
Pascale Parata.

06:51.802 --> 06:53.674
How the hell
did you rope Pascale in?

06:55.850 --> 06:57.547
You dropped my name.

06:59.506 --> 07:02.378
[sighs]
Sorry, Icepick.

07:02.422 --> 07:04.685
You were always in a jam
growing up, Rick.

07:04.728 --> 07:06.164
Headed down the wrong path.

07:06.208 --> 07:08.863
On your way to becoming
a criminal degenerate like me.

07:08.906 --> 07:11.996
So what do I do?
I nudge you onto another path.

07:12.040 --> 07:14.999
Now you're a war hero
earning an honest living,

07:15.043 --> 07:18.263
and still you're mixing up
with animals like Pascale.

07:18.307 --> 07:21.136
And what the hell were you doing
bringing a crime boss to a game?

07:21.179 --> 07:23.007
Look, I know, I know. It was
stupid. I get it, all right?

07:24.139 --> 07:26.881
[exhales]

07:26.924 --> 07:29.884
My guess? They're amateurs.

07:29.927 --> 07:32.016
What makes you say that?Because if

07:32.060 --> 07:33.496
you're gonna pull
a cowboy score like that,

07:33.540 --> 07:35.411
you wait till the end
of the night

07:35.455 --> 07:38.240
when the maximum amount of coin
is on the table.

07:38.283 --> 07:40.242
Look, my advice to you, kid?

07:40.285 --> 07:43.332
Be smart. Stay out.

07:43.375 --> 07:47.162
Guy like Pascale gets involved,
it always gets messy.

07:47.205 --> 07:50.557
And no skirt is worth a bullet
between the eyes.

07:50.600 --> 07:52.384
Toni is way more than that.

07:52.428 --> 07:54.212
You sound bit, my friend.

07:54.256 --> 07:55.692
Maybe.

07:57.302 --> 07:59.304
She has MS.

08:00.436 --> 08:02.264
Tough break.

08:02.307 --> 08:04.658
Not for her, it isn't.
Let me tell you, Ice,

08:04.701 --> 08:07.487
this woman is stronger
than I ever will be.

08:07.530 --> 08:09.663
And she knows me well.

08:09.706 --> 08:12.579
So much so that I was afraid
to make a move at first.

08:12.622 --> 08:15.886
Got a gal who can call you out
on all that baggage you got.

08:17.845 --> 08:19.586
That's a horse
of a different color.

08:22.414 --> 08:25.461
So, you think
you can talk to Pascale?

08:25.505 --> 08:28.203
He gave her a deadline
till this afternoon.

08:28.246 --> 08:31.902
I-I just need a little more time
to track down the dough.

08:31.946 --> 08:35.427
My one redeeming quality
in this life

08:35.471 --> 08:39.910
is that I've always tried
to be a father figure to you.

08:39.954 --> 08:43.827
What kind of father figure
would I be now if I stepped in?

08:46.438 --> 08:49.050
No.

08:49.093 --> 08:52.444
You got yourself into this,
Rick. Get yourself out.

08:52.488 --> 08:55.622
It's the only way
you're gonna learn.

09:01.105 --> 09:02.846
[lock buzzes]

09:11.725 --> 09:13.422
You talk to Icepick?

09:13.465 --> 09:15.598
Yeah, his hands are tied.

09:15.642 --> 09:18.166
What is this?

09:18.209 --> 09:19.820
We got less than six hours.

09:19.863 --> 09:22.039
What are you guys doing gawking
at women on FlicPhoto?

09:22.083 --> 09:24.389
Relax, we're not.You said the gunmen

09:24.433 --> 09:26.174
wore jeans and hoodies, right?Yeah.

09:26.217 --> 09:28.829
Well, Thomas had the smart idea
of looking through any photos

09:28.872 --> 09:31.092
location-tagged
to the hotel last night

09:31.135 --> 09:33.616
to see if maybe somebody
caught those guys on camera

09:33.660 --> 09:35.313
coming in or out of the place.

09:35.357 --> 09:37.838
Oh, that is smart.
You get anywhere?

09:37.881 --> 09:39.535
Not yet.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.842
I checked out Toni's dealer
and bouncer. They're both clean.

09:41.885 --> 09:43.583
I mean, it's possible
somebody mentioned

09:43.626 --> 09:45.933
something to the gunmen
about the game,

09:45.976 --> 09:47.587
or maybe one of the players
blabbed about it,

09:47.630 --> 09:48.979
and somebody thought
it'd be a quick score.

09:49.023 --> 09:51.068
[chuckles]:
If that's what happened,

09:51.112 --> 09:52.853
then my money's
on the hedge fund guy.

09:52.896 --> 09:54.855
You mean Bert. Why him?

09:54.898 --> 09:57.335
Because this clown
was dumb enough

09:57.379 --> 09:59.860
to actually post a photo of
his chip stack during the game.

09:59.903 --> 10:01.122
Well, that makes sense.

10:01.165 --> 10:02.819
Bert thinks he's a
social media celebrity.

10:02.863 --> 10:04.560
He's got, like, 90 followers.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.518
Yeah, a guy who would brag
like this seems like

10:06.562 --> 10:08.608
the same type
who would run his mouth.

10:08.651 --> 10:09.739
MAGNUM:
Yeah, but the problem is

10:09.783 --> 10:11.306
we don't have time
to talk to everybody

10:11.349 --> 10:12.786
that Bert might have mentioned
the game to.

10:12.829 --> 10:15.353
I think our best chance we have
of seeing these guys

10:15.397 --> 10:17.225
is the hotel's
video surveillance.

10:17.268 --> 10:19.531
I told you, that place has a
very high-security firewall.

10:19.575 --> 10:21.185
It would take days
to break through.

10:21.229 --> 10:23.057
Well, that's why we've just got
to go down there and get it.

10:23.100 --> 10:25.755
But how? You're not a cop.

10:25.799 --> 10:27.801
Yeah, and I have a feeling
that they're not just gonna

10:27.844 --> 10:29.367
hand it over if you go
there and ask nicely.

10:29.411 --> 10:31.413
No, you're probably right.

10:31.456 --> 10:34.459
But I think I have an idea.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.115
[line ringing]

10:38.159 --> 10:39.421
HIGGINS:
Hello.

10:39.464 --> 10:41.205
Higgy, it's Magnum.

10:41.249 --> 10:44.078
Uh, how do you feel
about being my wife?

10:48.996 --> 10:51.694
Must we really walk
arm-in-arm?

10:51.738 --> 10:54.610
Y-Yes. Well, you want them
to buy it, don't you?

10:54.654 --> 10:57.308
Aloha. Welcome to the
Maika'i Hotel and Spa.

10:57.352 --> 10:58.483
How may I help you?

10:58.527 --> 11:00.311
Hi there, Philip.

11:00.355 --> 11:02.052
Uh, me and my lovely wife here
have a reservation

11:02.096 --> 11:04.707
under Sam Marlowe.

11:04.751 --> 11:06.187
[typing]

11:06.230 --> 11:07.492
PHILIP:
Hmm.

11:07.536 --> 11:10.191
I don't see any reservation
under that name.

11:10.234 --> 11:13.716
Well, there must be
some kind of mistake.

11:13.760 --> 11:15.631
We made the reservation
months ago.

11:15.675 --> 11:17.459
[American accent]:
Um, Philip,

11:17.502 --> 11:20.070
if you could just do me a favor
and would you just check again?

11:20.114 --> 11:22.203
There must be some
kind of a mix-up.

11:22.246 --> 11:25.728
I mean,
it's-it's our anniversary.

11:25.772 --> 11:28.122
I'm sorry, but, uh,
it's not here.

11:28.165 --> 11:30.254
Wait. Okay, hold up.

11:30.298 --> 11:33.214
Are you saying a reservation
that I made three months ago

11:33.257 --> 11:34.389
somehow just vanished?

11:34.432 --> 11:36.434
HIGGINS:
Honey, calm down.

11:36.478 --> 11:37.740
I'm sure that they can, uh,

11:37.784 --> 11:39.133
still accommodate us,
right, Philip?

11:39.176 --> 11:40.961
I'm sorry, ma'am,
but it's just that

11:41.004 --> 11:42.658
the International Pet Food
Convention's in town

11:42.702 --> 11:44.051
and we're completely
booked up.

11:44.094 --> 11:47.315
The International
Pet Food Convention?

11:47.358 --> 11:48.795
Are you kidding me?

11:48.838 --> 11:50.579
We-we flew 15 hours from Omaha

11:50.622 --> 11:52.059
to get here to celebrate
our anniversary,

11:52.102 --> 11:54.191
and now you're kicking us out
on the street

11:54.235 --> 11:55.845
because some International

11:55.889 --> 11:57.281
Pet Food Convention is
happening? That's crazy.

11:57.325 --> 11:58.892
HIGGINS:
Honey, relax.

11:58.935 --> 12:01.242
It's-it's not good for your
blood pressure.

12:01.285 --> 12:02.809
I want to talk
to the manager,

12:02.852 --> 12:05.812
Mr. Akamu; I made
my reservation with him,

12:05.855 --> 12:08.336
and he promised me not only that
the suite would be ready,

12:08.379 --> 12:10.468
but that there'd be rose petals
scattered from the doorway

12:10.512 --> 12:12.949
to the bedroom,
just like I asked.

12:12.993 --> 12:15.299
I'm sorry, babe, that was
supposed to be a surprise.

12:15.343 --> 12:17.475
Aw... rose petals?

12:17.519 --> 12:19.390
Honey, that's so romantic.I know, it's really...

12:19.434 --> 12:20.435
I know.

12:20.478 --> 12:21.828
Akamu, of course.

12:21.871 --> 12:23.090
One second.

12:25.266 --> 12:27.181
Okay, do your thing.

12:29.009 --> 12:31.620
Nice American accent,
by the way.

12:31.663 --> 12:33.013
HIGGINS [normal voice]:
There's nothing nice about
an American accent.

12:34.841 --> 12:36.843
Wish me luck.

12:42.674 --> 12:44.372
AKAMU: Mr. Marlowe?Yes.

12:44.415 --> 12:45.895
I'm Akamu.Mm.

12:45.939 --> 12:48.115
I understand we have an issue.Yeah.

12:48.158 --> 12:49.812
Yeah, there's an issue.
My wife's in the ladies room

12:49.856 --> 12:51.205
crying her eyes out right now.

12:51.248 --> 12:53.816
You know, I'm a verified user
on Yelp

12:53.860 --> 12:56.993
with 714 reviews,
and I have never,

12:57.037 --> 13:00.301
okay, not once,
left a one-star review.

13:00.344 --> 13:01.693
Don't make me start today.

13:05.045 --> 13:06.960
Not only that,

13:07.003 --> 13:10.180
I have almost 10,000 followers
on Twitter.

13:10.224 --> 13:12.313
I don't want to leave a review
talking about this clusterfudge.

13:12.356 --> 13:14.794
I want to talk about how
spectacular this place is,

13:14.837 --> 13:17.013
how attentive the staff can be,

13:17.057 --> 13:18.885
the food, the-the spa,
the services.

13:18.928 --> 13:20.234
Like, all that stuff.

13:20.277 --> 13:22.018
And we all want that, too.

13:27.154 --> 13:29.852
It seems we actually have
a last-minute cancellation.

13:29.896 --> 13:31.811
Okay.
It's not the room
you booked

13:31.854 --> 13:33.421
but it does have an ocean view.

13:33.464 --> 13:35.379
I like ocean.
Plus,

13:35.423 --> 13:37.468
I can give you a voucher
for two free nights

13:37.512 --> 13:39.601
in our fabulous honeymoon suite

13:39.644 --> 13:41.472
to be redeemed at
a later date.

13:41.516 --> 13:43.518
Would that be satisfactory?

13:43.561 --> 13:46.042
You know what, Akamu?

13:46.086 --> 13:50.525
This is the kind of service
I expect from the Maika'i Hotel.

13:50.568 --> 13:52.222
You just earned yourself
five stars, buddy.

13:52.266 --> 13:53.484
Thank you, sir.

13:53.528 --> 13:54.921
Thank you.
You, too, Philip.

13:54.964 --> 13:56.748
I'm going to go
tell my wife.

13:56.792 --> 13:59.664
They bolted right
after midnight.

13:59.708 --> 14:01.884
I'll check the cameras by
the lobby elevator and stairs.

14:01.928 --> 14:05.192
MAGNUM:
Uhp, there. Took the
service elevator down.

14:05.235 --> 14:08.499
It looks like they're headed
for the parking garage.

14:08.543 --> 14:11.024
RICK:
Terrific.

14:11.067 --> 14:12.895
No clear shot
of their faces.

14:12.939 --> 14:14.723
It's like they knew where
the cameras were.

14:14.766 --> 14:16.986
Could've done some recon
beforehand.

14:17.030 --> 14:19.206
RICK:
Ah, getaway car.

14:19.249 --> 14:20.860
They had a wheelman.

14:20.903 --> 14:22.383
HIGGINS: Right.[typing]

14:27.910 --> 14:30.870
The vehicle is registered to
a Terry Kanarot.

14:30.913 --> 14:32.872
His address is in Mililani.
450 Coral Road.

14:34.786 --> 14:36.658
MAGNUM:
Let's go.

14:53.544 --> 14:55.546
[quietly]:
You find him?

14:55.590 --> 14:57.766
You don't have to whisper.

15:17.177 --> 15:18.134
TC:
Damn.

15:18.178 --> 15:20.745
RICK:
Is that the money?

15:20.789 --> 15:24.053
Nah. It's just
the personal stuff.

15:24.097 --> 15:26.316
Wallets,
phones, watches.

15:26.360 --> 15:28.971
This one here is,
uh, Mike Davis.

15:29.015 --> 15:31.104
Then that must be Terry.

15:31.147 --> 15:32.844
You think the guy that was
driving turned on these guys

15:32.888 --> 15:34.150
and split with the cash?

15:34.194 --> 15:35.717
Maybe.

15:37.893 --> 15:40.200
Or it was whoever told them
about the poker game.

15:43.333 --> 15:44.813
Your boy's eyes are closed.

15:44.856 --> 15:46.336
You're gonna have to
pry 'em open

15:46.380 --> 15:47.816
if you want that to work.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.994
I'm gonna go ahead
and call "not it."

15:52.038 --> 15:53.996
Yeah. TC and I
found this place, man.

15:54.040 --> 15:55.345
I... I think it's all you.

15:58.958 --> 16:01.003
RICK:
You guys are such candy-asses.

16:03.310 --> 16:05.094
There you go.

16:05.138 --> 16:06.661
[sighs]

16:06.704 --> 16:07.575
Okay, this is interesting.

16:07.618 --> 16:08.706
What you got?

16:08.750 --> 16:10.447
Terry was texting

16:10.491 --> 16:12.014
with a guy named Charley Franks
immediately before

16:12.058 --> 16:14.016
and after the robbery,

16:14.060 --> 16:16.236
saying, "Almost at the door."

16:16.279 --> 16:17.367
"Keep the engine running."

16:17.411 --> 16:18.760
Terry was giving Franks
updates.

16:18.803 --> 16:20.588
So this Franks could be
the wheelman.

16:20.631 --> 16:23.373
Maybe. If he is,
we got to find him.

16:23.417 --> 16:24.853
Go through that, see if there's
anybody connected to the game.

16:27.029 --> 16:29.466
No, it doesn't look like it.

16:29.510 --> 16:31.207
They got a tip from somebody.

16:33.166 --> 16:34.906
What?

16:36.734 --> 16:39.215
Okay. Just... just hear me out.

16:39.259 --> 16:41.087
Theoretically,

16:41.130 --> 16:44.742
Toni could have told these two
guys about the game, right?

16:44.786 --> 16:47.528
Oh, come on. You crazy? Toni?

16:47.571 --> 16:49.138
You said it yourself.

16:49.182 --> 16:51.053
Her brother needs care.

16:51.097 --> 16:53.447
A big score like that
could help.

16:53.490 --> 16:55.144
Yeah, but she was already
taking a rake.

16:55.188 --> 16:56.624
What is it, five percent?

16:56.667 --> 16:58.234
Toni's not gonna rip off
her own game.

16:58.278 --> 17:00.149
I don't know, man.
You'd be surprised

17:00.193 --> 17:01.846
what people would do for family.

17:01.890 --> 17:05.024
Hey, you don't know her, okay?[phone ringing]

17:07.026 --> 17:09.419
Hey.

17:09.463 --> 17:10.638
All right, stay there.

17:10.681 --> 17:12.292
Stay there, I'll be right over.

17:12.335 --> 17:13.641
Is there a problem?

17:13.684 --> 17:14.946
Yeah. It's, uh, it's Toni.

17:14.990 --> 17:16.861
I got to go over there.She okay?

17:16.905 --> 17:18.080
Not really.

17:18.124 --> 17:19.168
Should we come?

17:19.212 --> 17:22.171
No. No. Y-You just...

17:22.215 --> 17:23.999
you go and make sure you find
that Franks guy.

17:24.043 --> 17:26.132
[sighs]

17:26.175 --> 17:27.959
I don't think he wanted
to hear that about Toni.

17:28.003 --> 17:29.918
Yeah.

17:29.961 --> 17:32.138
So what do we do
with these two stiffs?

17:39.188 --> 17:40.276
[horn honks]

17:47.979 --> 17:50.504
Pascale's crew do this?

17:50.547 --> 17:54.595
If they were sending a message,
I heard it loud and clear.

17:54.638 --> 17:57.380
This is all my fault.

17:57.424 --> 17:59.382
No, it's not.

17:59.426 --> 18:00.644
No, it is.

18:00.688 --> 18:02.385
I'm the one that
roped in Pascale.

18:03.517 --> 18:06.085
What? What is it?

18:06.128 --> 18:08.478
I'm thinking I should just get
on the next flight off-island.

18:08.522 --> 18:10.654
You're gonna run?

18:10.698 --> 18:12.265
What choice do I have?

18:12.308 --> 18:13.614
I promise, we're gonna find
the money.

18:13.657 --> 18:15.703
Odds are you won't.

18:15.746 --> 18:16.965
No, that's not true.

18:17.008 --> 18:18.662
No, we got a lead
and it's a good one.

18:18.706 --> 18:20.142
The guys are working
on it right now.

18:20.186 --> 18:21.274
Running is
the safe move here.

18:27.062 --> 18:28.237
Were you in on this?

18:30.326 --> 18:31.501
What?

18:31.545 --> 18:32.807
Just answer the question.

18:32.850 --> 18:34.243
Were you involved in this
in any way?

18:34.287 --> 18:36.332
In the robbery?

18:36.376 --> 18:38.117
How could you even ask me that?

18:38.160 --> 18:39.814
Your brother needs money
right now.

18:39.857 --> 18:41.424
100% is better than five.

18:41.468 --> 18:43.644
Are you serious?

18:43.687 --> 18:45.950
Look, those guys didn't just
stumble onto that game.

18:45.994 --> 18:47.343
Somebody told them about it.

18:47.387 --> 18:49.432
Somebody gave them
the time and the place.

18:49.476 --> 18:51.782
And you think that
didn't occur to me?

18:51.826 --> 18:54.350
I've been asking myself,
was it Liko, was it my dealer

18:54.394 --> 18:55.960
who could've talked?

18:56.004 --> 18:58.311
But you have to believe me,
I had nothing to do with this.

18:58.354 --> 19:00.704
Look, I want to believe you,
but I...
Forget it, Rick.

19:00.748 --> 19:02.315
I don't want to talk anymore.

19:02.358 --> 19:04.099
Hey, hey, hey.
Listen, listen.

19:04.143 --> 19:05.535
Don't leave.
Don't leave.

19:05.579 --> 19:07.581
Look.

19:07.624 --> 19:10.366
You. Me. This.

19:10.410 --> 19:12.020
This...

19:12.063 --> 19:13.891
This could be something.

19:15.676 --> 19:18.461
Come on, tell me
you don't feel it, too.

19:19.984 --> 19:21.290
Tell me you feel something.

19:21.334 --> 19:22.726
I'm-I'm really
putting myself out here.

19:24.598 --> 19:26.295
I do.

19:29.559 --> 19:32.780
Look, I know you're scared,
but you got to trust me.

19:32.823 --> 19:34.434
And if we don't find
the money,

19:34.477 --> 19:36.175
I'll be on that flight with you.

19:36.218 --> 19:38.089
You can't mean that.

19:38.133 --> 19:39.178
Why not?

19:44.357 --> 19:47.577
MAGNUM: TC and I went by
Charley Franks' apartment.

19:47.621 --> 19:49.231
Place was empty,
but we talked to a neighbor

19:49.275 --> 19:51.233
who saw Charley leaving
this morning with a backpack

19:51.277 --> 19:52.887
and overnight bag.

19:52.930 --> 19:55.324
My guess is our wheelman's
gonna lay low for a bit.

19:55.368 --> 19:56.978
And I think I might know where.

19:57.021 --> 19:59.415
So you think we're gonna find
him over there?

19:59.459 --> 20:02.157
Mm. I know this might sound
crazy but I've had my fair share

20:02.201 --> 20:04.464
of skip traces, and
more than half the time

20:04.507 --> 20:07.336
they're hiding out
at their mom's place.

20:07.380 --> 20:08.642
â™ª Bad boys, bad boys

20:08.685 --> 20:10.078
â™ª What you gonna do?

20:10.121 --> 20:12.167
â™ª What you gonna do
when they come for you? â™ª

20:12.211 --> 20:14.865
Katsumoto!

20:14.909 --> 20:16.824
I'm about to head out
to a crime scene in Mililani.

20:16.867 --> 20:18.086
Two bodies at a house.

20:18.129 --> 20:19.653
You know anything about that?

20:19.696 --> 20:21.176
No, I-I can't say I do.

20:21.220 --> 20:22.699
Magnum,

20:22.743 --> 20:24.919
you know they record those
anonymous tip lines, don't you?

20:24.962 --> 20:26.312
And you know

20:26.355 --> 20:28.009
I know your voice, right?

20:28.052 --> 20:30.011
Uh, yeah, yeah.

20:30.054 --> 20:31.360
No, I-I...

20:31.404 --> 20:33.754
I called it in, all right?
You got me.

20:33.797 --> 20:35.277
Great. Want to explain
how you ended up

20:35.321 --> 20:37.192
at a crime scene
with two dead bodies?

20:37.236 --> 20:40.282
Uh, you know, I'd love to,
but I'm on a case right now.

20:40.326 --> 20:42.980
But I promise you I-I
will fill you in later.

20:43.024 --> 20:44.721
I'm gonna check out
this crime scene,

20:44.765 --> 20:46.419
but after that,
you're gonna tell me everything.

20:57.473 --> 20:59.432
What's that for?

20:59.475 --> 21:01.434
Just follow my lead.

21:01.477 --> 21:03.218
I don't know, man.

21:03.262 --> 21:06.003
This Charley guy looks like he
grew up in a nice neighborhood.

21:06.047 --> 21:08.441
Patriotic family.

21:08.484 --> 21:10.007
Yeah, how'd he get involved
in something like this?Yeah.

21:11.400 --> 21:12.749
Good question.

21:17.450 --> 21:19.800
Hi. Can I help you gentlemen?

21:19.843 --> 21:22.019
You're not here to sell
me something, are you?

21:22.063 --> 21:24.283
Mm, no, ma'am. We're
actually census takers.

21:25.936 --> 21:28.548
Uh, but the census isn't
for another two years.

21:28.591 --> 21:30.201
Just getting
an early jump on it.

21:30.245 --> 21:32.856
A lot of people to count.

21:33.988 --> 21:35.685
So, it says here, uh,

21:35.729 --> 21:37.644
Charley Franks resides
at this address.

21:37.687 --> 21:39.602
Uh, can I talk to him?

21:39.646 --> 21:40.864
That can't be right.

21:40.908 --> 21:42.779
Charley has his own place.

21:42.823 --> 21:45.304
So... Charley's not here?

21:45.347 --> 21:47.393
No. Sorry.

21:47.436 --> 21:48.655
So nobody else resides here?

21:48.698 --> 21:50.483
No, just me.

21:50.526 --> 21:53.355
Oh. Who's the other pair
of slippers for?

21:53.399 --> 21:55.488
Uh, those.

21:55.531 --> 21:56.967
They're mine.

21:57.011 --> 21:58.317
[chuckles]:
Really?

21:58.360 --> 21:59.361
Men's size 12, huh?

22:00.667 --> 22:02.843
[engine revs]

22:02.886 --> 22:03.974
[tires squeal]

22:14.071 --> 22:16.073
MAGNUM:
A lot of people ask me

22:16.117 --> 22:17.553
why I choose to drive
Robin Masters' car

22:17.597 --> 22:19.207
instead of getting
one of my own.

22:19.250 --> 22:22.906
Easy. Zero to 100
in just 2.9 seconds.

22:33.395 --> 22:35.441
Thomas, I-I think
he's gonna hit us, man.

22:35.484 --> 22:37.356
MAGNUM:
Nah, he's gonna stop.

22:37.399 --> 22:40.271
That's easy for you
to say-- if we get T-boned,
I'm the one getting boned!

22:40.315 --> 22:42.230
Come on, man, do something!
Quit playing, man!

22:46.582 --> 22:48.845
See? Told you he
was gonna stop.

22:48.889 --> 22:49.977
I hate you.

22:55.112 --> 22:56.766
Got the money.

22:56.810 --> 22:58.028
Who are you guys?

22:58.072 --> 22:59.856
He's a private investigator,

22:59.900 --> 23:02.468
and I'm... I guess
you could say I'm the muscle.

23:02.511 --> 23:04.470
[panting]: I thought
maybe you were the guys

23:04.513 --> 23:05.949
that killed
Terry and Mike.

23:05.993 --> 23:07.124
Oh, so you didn't kill them?

23:07.168 --> 23:08.909
What? No way, man.

23:08.952 --> 23:10.519
Okay, so there's two dead guys,
and you got

23:10.563 --> 23:12.434
the money they stole--
you tell me how that looks.

23:12.478 --> 23:14.393
Yeah. But I didn't kill them.

23:14.436 --> 23:16.003
Look, when I got
to Terry's place this morning,

23:16.046 --> 23:17.526
they were already dead.

23:17.570 --> 23:19.093
I just saw the money there,
and I grabbed it.

23:19.136 --> 23:21.225
So somebody else killed them

23:21.269 --> 23:23.532
and left that big wad
of cash behind?

23:23.576 --> 23:25.491
Good luck selling HPD on that.

23:25.534 --> 23:27.971
It's the truth.
I'd never betray
those guys.

23:28.015 --> 23:30.931
So if you didn't kill them,
who did?I don't know.

23:30.974 --> 23:32.628
And who told them
about the poker game?

23:32.672 --> 23:34.195
I don't know
that, either.

23:34.238 --> 23:35.762
Look, they didn't
tell me much.

23:35.805 --> 23:37.546
Terry just, he...
he asked for my help,

23:37.590 --> 23:38.504
and I said okay.

23:38.547 --> 23:39.896
Just like that?

23:39.940 --> 23:41.594
He was a good guy.

23:41.637 --> 23:43.030
Mike, too.

23:43.073 --> 23:45.206
Look, I get how it looks,
but it's the truth.

23:45.249 --> 23:48.252
My older brother served
with them.

23:48.296 --> 23:50.341
2nd Ranger Battalion.
He was KIA.

23:52.039 --> 23:53.301
Terry and Mike brought
his body back,

23:53.344 --> 23:55.042
so my mom and I
could give him a proper burial.

23:57.566 --> 23:59.394
I owed those guys.

23:59.438 --> 24:01.483
I would've done whatever
they asked, no questions.

24:01.527 --> 24:03.877
And besides,

24:03.920 --> 24:06.488
Terry... he said he
was doing it for a good reason.

24:06.532 --> 24:08.795
He said he was doing it
for his family,

24:08.838 --> 24:10.492
and it wasn't about money.

24:10.536 --> 24:12.581
[panting]

24:12.625 --> 24:15.105
â™ª Bad boys, bad boys,
what you gonna do? â™ª

24:15.149 --> 24:19.153
â™ª What you gonna do
when they come for you? â™ª

24:19.196 --> 24:20.720
Katsumoto.

24:20.763 --> 24:22.983
All right, I checked out the
crime scene. Now it's your turn.

24:23.026 --> 24:24.680
How the hell'd you
get onto a double murder?

24:24.724 --> 24:27.291
I was investigating a robbery.

24:27.335 --> 24:29.859
The two vics ripped off
a friend of mine last night.

24:29.903 --> 24:30.686
You sure about that?

24:30.730 --> 24:32.296
100%.

24:32.340 --> 24:34.821
Well, I'm finding that
a little hard to believe.

24:34.864 --> 24:35.822
Why?

24:35.865 --> 24:36.910
We ran both of them.

24:36.953 --> 24:39.086
Terry Kanarot and Mike Davis

24:39.129 --> 24:40.217
were decorated former soldiers.

24:40.261 --> 24:41.784
Both served with distinction.

24:41.828 --> 24:44.526
Both had good jobs,
stable lives.

24:44.570 --> 24:45.962
Is that right?

24:46.006 --> 24:47.268
Any idea who killed them?

24:49.618 --> 24:51.446
MAGNUM:
My little voice is telling me

24:51.490 --> 24:53.143
that Charley
is telling the truth,

24:53.187 --> 24:55.537
which means I've got
a choice here: tell Katsumoto

24:55.581 --> 24:57.713
about him, or leave him out
of it and cross my fingers

24:57.757 --> 25:00.499
that I'm not letting
a killer off the hook.

25:00.542 --> 25:03.066
No, I don't... I don't know.

25:03.110 --> 25:04.546
Sorry.

25:04.590 --> 25:06.548
I have to talk to the M.E.

25:06.592 --> 25:09.638
But I want to see you
in my office in two hours.

25:09.682 --> 25:11.771
You're gonna walk me
through every step of
your investigation.

25:13.990 --> 25:16.036
Well, Charley,

25:16.079 --> 25:17.777
looks like it's
your lucky day.

25:17.820 --> 25:20.301
We're gonna take this,

25:20.344 --> 25:22.042
try not to mention
your name to HPD.

25:22.085 --> 25:23.260
In the meantime,

25:23.304 --> 25:24.479
lay low, all right?

25:24.523 --> 25:25.480
Whoever killed

25:25.524 --> 25:26.960
Terry and Mike
might want

25:27.003 --> 25:29.136
to try and tie up
some loose ends.

25:29.179 --> 25:31.399
I got it.
Thank you.

25:31.442 --> 25:32.487
Let's get out of here.

25:32.531 --> 25:33.575
Got somebody waiting
for this money.

25:33.619 --> 25:36.360
My bad, man.

25:36.404 --> 25:38.362
[panting]

25:38.406 --> 25:40.277
[sighs]

25:40.321 --> 25:44.412
Wow. Guys...
I cannot thank you enough.

25:44.455 --> 25:47.023
Thank you, thank you,
thank you. Come on.

25:47.067 --> 25:48.590
Bring it in.
I need a group hug.

25:48.634 --> 25:50.026
Thank you, boys.

25:50.070 --> 25:51.462
Thank you so much.

25:51.506 --> 25:52.812
Now all I got to do is
text Pascale

25:52.855 --> 25:55.205
and tell him
we have his money.

25:55.249 --> 25:59.209
I don't know about y'all, man,
but I am beat.

25:59.253 --> 26:01.560
Y'all got me running around here
like I'm Shaft.

26:01.603 --> 26:05.128
All this private investigator
work is hard, man.

26:05.172 --> 26:06.434
[exhales]

26:08.305 --> 26:10.351
Hey, man, you okay?

26:10.394 --> 26:12.919
Yeah. I just don't have
that "case closed" feeling.

26:12.962 --> 26:14.355
You know?

26:14.398 --> 26:15.965
What are you talking about?

26:16.009 --> 26:19.578
We got the money back,
Toni's safe.

26:19.621 --> 26:21.884
Got my stuff back.
All is good in the world.

26:21.928 --> 26:24.278
There's also two dead Rangers
sitting on ice in the morgue.

26:26.367 --> 26:28.717
Yeah, that's true.

26:28.761 --> 26:30.763
I mean, HPD's on it,
though, right?

26:30.806 --> 26:33.113
I don't get it.
They-they served with honor,

26:33.156 --> 26:34.767
they had great jobs,
and then they suddenly decide

26:34.810 --> 26:37.334
to break bad and-and pull off
a robbery like this?

26:37.378 --> 26:38.466
It just doesn't
make sense.

26:38.509 --> 26:39.641
Well, Charley said that
they did it

26:39.685 --> 26:41.991
for a good reason, right?

26:42.035 --> 26:43.427
That it was about family.

26:43.471 --> 26:45.081
Maybe that's where
the answer lies.

26:45.125 --> 26:47.431
He also said
it wasn't about money.

26:47.475 --> 26:51.087
Maybe they were
after something else.

26:51.131 --> 26:52.306
What do you mean,
"something else"?

26:52.349 --> 26:53.786
Well...

26:57.050 --> 27:01.141
...money wasn't the only thing
they stole at the poker game.

27:01.184 --> 27:03.926
What are you doing?

27:05.319 --> 27:07.582
There it is.
The-the hula girl key chain.

27:12.021 --> 27:13.327
It isn't here.

27:15.677 --> 27:17.897
What if those guys were
after the keys,

27:17.940 --> 27:19.986
and they-they stole everything
else to cover it up?

27:20.029 --> 27:21.770
And then they
killed those guys

27:21.814 --> 27:23.337
to get the keys back.

27:23.380 --> 27:25.948
And that explains
the left-behind money.

27:25.992 --> 27:27.167
TC:
I don't know, Thomas.

27:27.210 --> 27:28.777
That all seems like
a reach to me, man.

27:28.821 --> 27:30.692
Actually, it doesn't.

27:30.736 --> 27:32.302
You know, Icepick said
something to me earlier.

27:32.346 --> 27:35.001
He said,
"You don't rob a poker game

27:35.044 --> 27:36.089
until the end of the night."

27:36.132 --> 27:37.699
These guys didn't do that.

27:37.743 --> 27:40.006
That tells me money
wasn't the priority.MAGNUM: Exactly.

27:40.049 --> 27:41.485
They were after the keys.

27:41.529 --> 27:44.053
Okay, so who do the keys
belong to?

27:44.097 --> 27:45.881
Whoever it is, they're
probably the killer, right?

27:45.925 --> 27:47.274
Rick?

27:47.317 --> 27:50.059
Let's see, uh, who was
sitting across from Bert?

27:50.103 --> 27:52.496
Uh, Russell Chang.

27:52.540 --> 27:53.759
MAGNUM:
What's his story?

27:53.802 --> 27:55.499
He's a local business guy.

27:55.543 --> 27:58.198
He owns some sort
of employment agency.

27:58.241 --> 27:59.590
Agro Workforce Solutions.
Something like that.

27:59.634 --> 28:01.114
Is he shady?

28:01.157 --> 28:03.072
I-I don't know him very well.

28:03.116 --> 28:04.683
But you know who does?

28:04.726 --> 28:07.163
Pascale.

28:07.207 --> 28:10.123
Probably shady.[line ringing]

28:10.166 --> 28:12.212
PASCALE [on speaker]:
Hello?
Hey.

28:12.255 --> 28:13.735
It's Rick Wright.
I just sent you a text.

28:13.779 --> 28:14.867
I got your money.

28:14.910 --> 28:15.955
Saw that.

28:15.998 --> 28:17.696
Come by my club, 30 minutes.

28:17.739 --> 28:19.175
RICK:
You got it.

28:19.219 --> 28:20.742
Hey, now that I'm back
in your good graces,

28:20.786 --> 28:22.526
let me ask you something.

28:22.570 --> 28:24.703
What can you tell me
about Russell Chang?

28:24.746 --> 28:26.182
Why are you asking?

28:26.226 --> 28:28.794
Just indulge me.
Is he trouble?

28:28.837 --> 28:30.360
You could say that.
Word on the street is

28:30.404 --> 28:31.535
the guy's in the slave trade.

28:34.016 --> 28:35.322
Like trafficking?

28:35.365 --> 28:37.541
More like forced labor.

28:41.154 --> 28:42.372
So, what's the plan?

28:42.416 --> 28:44.244
Higgy finds this
Chang guy, then what?

28:44.287 --> 28:46.463
Confront him as to why
he killed two servicemen.

28:46.507 --> 28:49.118
HIGGINS:
Okay, got him.

28:49.162 --> 28:50.641
He's at the Hawaii Union Bank
on Ala Wai.

28:52.818 --> 28:54.776
What?

28:54.820 --> 28:56.386
MAGNUM:
Take a look at the key.

28:56.430 --> 28:58.475
TC:
What is that, a number?

28:58.519 --> 29:01.609
Could be a key
to a safe deposit box.

29:01.652 --> 29:03.002
If it is, I'd like to know
what's in there

29:03.045 --> 29:04.655
that's worth killing over.

29:04.699 --> 29:06.005
Let's head to the bank.

29:13.534 --> 29:15.318
MAGNUM:
There he is.

29:15.362 --> 29:17.581
Russell!

29:18.974 --> 29:19.758
Can we talk to you
for a minute?

29:22.108 --> 29:23.326
We just want to
ask you a question

29:23.370 --> 29:24.545
about Mike Davis

29:24.588 --> 29:26.460
and Terry Kanarot.Where you going, bro?

29:28.288 --> 29:30.856
TC, grab that.I'm on it.

29:35.077 --> 29:36.252
[Chang grunts]

29:36.296 --> 29:38.124
Get your ass over here.

29:38.167 --> 29:41.257
Wait, you're not a cop.

29:41.301 --> 29:42.781
Private investigator.

29:42.824 --> 29:45.871
Yo, Thomas, you got to see
what's in here, man.

29:49.439 --> 29:50.179
It's passports.

29:53.879 --> 29:55.794
Who are these people?

29:58.753 --> 30:01.625
He had 27 passports on him,
all citizens of Thailand.

30:01.669 --> 30:04.280
And he wouldn't tell us why,
but Rick did some research,

30:04.324 --> 30:06.369
and it turns out that
Chang's main business

30:06.413 --> 30:08.850
is recruiting workers
from foreign countries,

30:08.894 --> 30:10.852
and bringing them here
to work on local farms.

30:10.896 --> 30:12.854
Word is, once they
get here, he takes

30:12.898 --> 30:15.726
their passports and uses that
as leverage to keep 'em here.

30:15.770 --> 30:17.903
He tells them they'll get
their passports back

30:17.946 --> 30:20.688
after they work off the cost
of bringing 'em over here.

30:20.731 --> 30:22.081
Guy's a slave trader.

30:22.124 --> 30:24.648
MAGNUM: And there's
more. Higgins did

30:24.692 --> 30:26.737
a deep dive, and it turns out
that one of the gunmen,

30:26.781 --> 30:29.871
Terry, had a cousin who arrived
on the island eight months ago

30:29.915 --> 30:32.308
from New Bangkok International.

30:32.352 --> 30:34.310
His name is on one
of the passports.

30:34.354 --> 30:36.791
Yeah, we're thinking
that Terry and Mike were trying

30:36.835 --> 30:38.706
to get their hands
on these passports

30:38.749 --> 30:41.448
to liberate Terry's cousin and
the rest of these good people.

30:41.491 --> 30:46.018
Somehow those two must've found
out where Chang was keeping them

30:46.061 --> 30:48.498
and where he was gonna be
last night.

30:48.542 --> 30:50.326
Yeah, and since there were
no guns or bodyguards allowed in

30:50.370 --> 30:51.719
the hotel room, they thought
it'd be a great time

30:51.762 --> 30:53.895
to bust in there
and take the key.

30:53.939 --> 30:56.593
We need to find these people.

31:01.033 --> 31:02.382
You have the wrong idea.

31:02.425 --> 31:04.775
I was just holding on to these,
keeping them safe.

31:04.819 --> 31:07.169
I've got detectives out
at those farms right now.

31:07.213 --> 31:09.258
Apparently, these people
were all put on buses

31:09.302 --> 31:10.912
early this morning.

31:10.956 --> 31:12.740
Now no one can find them.

31:17.614 --> 31:22.489
808-555-0192.

31:22.532 --> 31:23.838
What's that?

31:23.882 --> 31:25.318
My lawyer's phone number.

31:25.361 --> 31:27.015
I think I'm done talking.

31:27.059 --> 31:28.712
I want to know
where these people are.

31:28.756 --> 31:30.149
Lawyer.

31:30.192 --> 31:32.238
You're relocating them,
aren't you?

31:35.023 --> 31:36.329
Lawyer.

31:36.372 --> 31:38.287
All right.

31:39.723 --> 31:41.464
Call your lawyer.

31:42.988 --> 31:45.686
I'm just gonna go call
the prosecuting attorney

31:45.729 --> 31:47.340
and have her indict your wife
as a coconspirator,

31:47.383 --> 31:49.342
since she's an employee
of your company.

31:49.385 --> 31:50.865
How old are your kids?

31:50.909 --> 31:53.259
Five and seven, right?

31:53.302 --> 31:55.217
If they're lucky, Child Services
won't split them up

31:55.261 --> 31:56.523
when they're put
in the foster system.

31:58.655 --> 31:59.787
[exhales]

32:04.096 --> 32:05.575
They're on a boat.

32:08.143 --> 32:09.840
He's moving 'em
off-island.

32:11.494 --> 32:13.192
Wait, uh, what are you doing?

32:13.235 --> 32:14.976
Gonna have the Coast Guard
intercept that boat.

32:15.020 --> 32:16.282
What? Hold up.

32:16.325 --> 32:17.805
The moment Chang's crew
is approached

32:17.848 --> 32:19.459
by any law enforcement vessel,

32:19.502 --> 32:21.069
they're gonna start throwing
bodies overboard.

32:21.113 --> 32:23.332
You got a better idea?

32:23.376 --> 32:25.552
Actually, yeah.

32:26.901 --> 32:27.989
I do.

32:38.652 --> 32:41.002
I can't believe I let
you talk me into this.

32:41.046 --> 32:42.699
This is a bad idea.

32:42.743 --> 32:44.310
People see a tour copter,
it's not gonna raise

32:44.353 --> 32:46.312
any red flags.No, I'm not talking
about that.

32:46.355 --> 32:48.140
That's a good idea. I'm talking
about letting you come along.

32:48.183 --> 32:50.229
I don't care if you
were military. You guys

32:50.272 --> 32:52.100
are civilians now.We're gonna be over
international waters.

32:52.144 --> 32:54.755
Anything goes wrong, you
will not be held responsible.

32:54.798 --> 32:56.844
Trust me.

32:56.887 --> 32:58.846
I still don't get why
you guys are doing this.

32:58.889 --> 33:01.762
Mike and Terry wanted
to free these people,

33:01.805 --> 33:03.242
and it cost them their lives.

33:03.285 --> 33:05.113
We didn't know 'em, but
they were still our brothers.

33:05.157 --> 33:08.247
We're gonna finish
what they started.

33:09.683 --> 33:11.598
â™ª

33:17.082 --> 33:17.734
Let's go.

33:25.133 --> 33:26.787
Get us out
of here, TC!

33:38.538 --> 33:41.149
I assume you have permits
for those.

33:41.193 --> 33:43.978
Yeah, yeah. I'll apply
for them as soon as we land.

33:50.115 --> 33:51.464
TC, I got her.

33:51.507 --> 33:53.683
There's no sign of any crew.

33:53.727 --> 33:55.772
Take us down, as close
to the deck as possible.

33:55.816 --> 33:57.774
All right. Hold on.

33:57.818 --> 33:59.472
This is gonna suck.

34:04.042 --> 34:05.869
[helicopter blades whirring]

34:09.221 --> 34:10.831
Go check it out.

34:10.874 --> 34:12.006
Come on.

34:22.712 --> 34:24.714
[whistles]

34:24.758 --> 34:25.802
[automatic gunfire]

34:46.084 --> 34:47.737
[grunting]

34:54.483 --> 34:56.006
[grunting]

35:02.578 --> 35:04.754
[shouting, grunting]

35:09.455 --> 35:10.847
[panting]

35:16.201 --> 35:17.898
[grunting]

35:19.204 --> 35:20.030
[groaning]

35:35.872 --> 35:36.656
How 'bout we turn
this boat around?

35:37.787 --> 35:39.485
How 'bout not?

35:40.486 --> 35:42.357
[groans]

35:45.230 --> 35:46.709
How 'bout we turn
this boat around?

35:48.842 --> 35:50.191
Absolutely.

35:50.235 --> 35:51.410
Thank you.

35:51.453 --> 35:52.585
How's that hand?

35:52.628 --> 35:54.195
Doesn't feel good.

35:57.764 --> 35:59.157
CAPTAIN:
In here.

36:05.772 --> 36:07.687
Turn around.

36:11.952 --> 36:15.434
[whimpering, crying]

36:18.437 --> 36:20.003
It's all right.

36:20.047 --> 36:21.483
You're safe.

36:21.527 --> 36:22.789
You can come out now.

36:25.357 --> 36:27.707
Thank you.

36:34.279 --> 36:35.845
Thank you.

36:43.113 --> 36:45.638
[man speaking Thai]

36:52.862 --> 36:55.561
Uh, I'd like to say a few
things, if that's all right.

36:55.604 --> 36:58.955
Um, to you guys, uh, thank you

36:58.999 --> 37:00.914
for always being there.[clears throat]

37:00.957 --> 37:02.524
Higgins, thanks
for having my back.

37:02.568 --> 37:04.309
You are very welcome.

37:04.352 --> 37:07.399
And to my new BFF,
Detective Katsumoto.

37:07.442 --> 37:08.487
Well, I wouldn't go that far.

37:08.530 --> 37:09.705
[chuckles]

37:09.749 --> 37:11.272
And to, uh, Terry and Mike,

37:11.316 --> 37:12.839
two guys who we didn't know,

37:12.882 --> 37:15.494
but I feel like
we had a lot in common with.

37:17.409 --> 37:18.366
Salud.
Cheers.

37:18.410 --> 37:21.587
Cheers.

37:21.630 --> 37:23.632
Hey. You made it.Hey.

37:23.676 --> 37:26.983
Yeah. Um, unfortunately,
I can't stay.

37:27.027 --> 37:28.376
Oh.

37:28.420 --> 37:30.552
Yeah. But I wanted to see you.

37:30.596 --> 37:31.901
Hi, guys.

37:31.945 --> 37:33.338
Hey.
Hey, hey.
Hey, how are you?

37:33.381 --> 37:34.948
Uh, what's-what's this?

37:34.991 --> 37:36.471
It's a little gift.

37:36.515 --> 37:37.777
Something to say thank you.Oh.

37:37.820 --> 37:40.693
TONI:
It's a koki'o ke'oke'o.

37:40.736 --> 37:43.304
Wow, it smells nice.[chuckles]

37:43.348 --> 37:45.263
Sure I'll be able
to keep this alive?

37:45.306 --> 37:46.873
You kept mealive.

37:49.049 --> 37:51.573
Can we talk alone for a minute?

37:51.617 --> 37:53.053
Yeah, sure.

37:59.755 --> 38:02.628
So I never told you this,
but when I moved to Hawaii,

38:02.671 --> 38:04.412
I never thought
it would be permanent.

38:04.456 --> 38:06.719
Just looking
for a little adventure.

38:06.762 --> 38:09.678
But I ended up sticking around
because I had a job that I liked

38:09.722 --> 38:11.550
and I met
some pretty great people.

38:12.681 --> 38:14.553
I sense a "but" coming.

38:15.945 --> 38:17.730
You got the money back,

38:17.773 --> 38:19.906
but my reputation's gonna
take a hit over this.

38:19.949 --> 38:22.300
I mean, who's gonna play
in a game that got held up?

38:22.343 --> 38:23.910
We'll figure something out.

38:23.953 --> 38:26.782
I'm gonna have to start over.

38:26.826 --> 38:30.090
And I don't think I can do that
on a tiny island.

38:35.182 --> 38:37.837
So my plant is a parting gift.

38:40.100 --> 38:42.407
I'm going back to the mainland,

38:42.450 --> 38:44.322
some place
where my games are legit,

38:44.365 --> 38:47.150
and I don't have to look over
my shoulder all the time.

38:47.194 --> 38:49.152
Most importantly,
I'll be close to my brother,

38:49.196 --> 38:50.763
who really needs me right now.

38:50.806 --> 38:53.548
So this is it?

38:53.592 --> 38:57.204
I don't know. I hope not.

38:57.247 --> 39:00.860
I know the
timing's lousy.

39:00.903 --> 39:02.601
Yeah.

39:02.644 --> 39:05.865
Thank you for everything.

39:05.908 --> 39:09.782
The game, the money,
your friendship.

39:12.654 --> 39:15.004
I wish it could be different.

39:15.048 --> 39:17.659
Me, too.

39:22.142 --> 39:25.058
Enjoy the plant.

39:25.101 --> 39:29.758
For some, it symbolizes
strength, and love.

39:33.283 --> 39:35.460
Bye, Rick.

39:35.503 --> 39:39.072
â™ª Where you're going,
I can't follow â™ª

39:39.115 --> 39:41.944
â™ª You

39:41.988 --> 39:46.427
â™ª So take me
where your ocean finds â™ª

39:46.471 --> 39:47.646
MAGNUM:
You all right?

39:47.689 --> 39:50.649
â™ª Its deepest blue...

39:50.692 --> 39:53.303
She's leaving.

39:53.347 --> 39:54.609
She's going back
to the mainland.

39:56.481 --> 39:58.613
I'm sorry to hear that.

39:58.657 --> 40:01.877
Yeah. It's not that bad.

40:01.921 --> 40:05.315
You know, we freed those people,
got the money back.

40:05.359 --> 40:07.317
Just didn't get the girl.

40:07.361 --> 40:09.450
Nah.
[laughs softly]

40:09.494 --> 40:11.496
Look at the bright side,

40:11.539 --> 40:15.325
you still got me,
TC and... a plant.

40:15.369 --> 40:19.329
Still though,
I'd rather have the girl.

40:19.373 --> 40:20.896
You know, if I had to choose.

40:20.940 --> 40:24.683
Yeah, I don't blame you,
brother.

40:24.726 --> 40:26.728
I don't blame you.

40:26.772 --> 40:30.253
â™ª The deepest blue.
