00:48.047 --> 00:49.632
I invited him to game night.

00:49.716 --> 00:51.509

I don't understand

00:51.593 --> 00:53.636
why you keep inviting people
to my home.

00:53.720 --> 00:57.307

happen for myself, you know.

00:57.390 --> 01:00.810

What's this again?

01:00.894 --> 01:02.479

I can't wait to see
what we're cooking up.

01:48.817 --> 01:51.152
These are my best friends,
Theresa and--

01:51.236 --> 01:52.904
- Hi.

01:52.987 --> 01:54.322
- Raquelle.
- Sorry.

01:54.405 --> 01:56.324
- You forgot my name.
- No, I didn't.

01:56.407 --> 01:57.700
- Hi, Raquelle. Hi, Theresa.

01:57.784 --> 01:59.577
- Hi.
- They're good, right?

01:59.661 --> 02:01.371
But why am I talking for you?

02:01.454 --> 02:04.374
- It's so nice to meet you.
I'm from Chicago.

02:04.457 --> 02:08.503
So I am very happy
to be cooking with you today.

02:08.586 --> 02:10.088
- Yeah. Will you tell us
what we're doing?

02:10.171 --> 02:11.881
- Yes, we are.
Tonight, I'm gonna teach you

02:11.965 --> 02:15.718
how to make
my classic pan pizza

02:15.802 --> 02:19.722

02:24.769 --> 02:28.481
It's the ultimate carb fest
for game night.

02:28.565 --> 02:30.567
- Whoo!
- That sounds amazing.

02:30.650 --> 02:33.778
I mean, forget the diet
I'm on, but yeah.

02:33.862 --> 02:36.406
- Hey, you know, it's--
who's counting?

02:36.489 --> 02:38.032
- [laughs]

02:38.116 --> 02:39.742
- So the first things we do
which is the things

02:39.826 --> 02:41.244
that takes a little longer,

02:41.327 --> 02:44.372
we have to make
the actual dough.

02:44.455 --> 02:46.291
So we're gonna make dough
from scratch.

02:46.374 --> 02:47.834
- Oh, boy.
- Ooh. Okay.

02:47.917 --> 02:52.046
- Do me a favor.
Pre-heat your oven to 475.

02:52.130 --> 02:54.674
- Okay.
- Find your stand-up mixer.

02:54.757 --> 02:56.426
- Is that the pink thing?
- Yeah.

02:56.509 --> 02:57.969
- With a paddle attachment.

02:58.052 --> 03:00.096
- It's heavy.
- Oh.

03:00.179 --> 03:02.932
- I like the pink color on it.
- Isn't it cute?

03:03.016 --> 03:05.435
- Adorable I would say.
Very cute.

03:05.518 --> 03:06.895
Do you have
a paddle attachment?

03:06.978 --> 03:09.439
- Okay.
<i>- The one on your left hand.</i>

03:09.522 --> 03:11.232
Yeah, kind of stick it in

03:11.316 --> 03:13.484
and then you flip it,
so it's secure, right?

03:13.568 --> 03:15.987
- Yes.
- Whoa.

03:16.070 --> 03:17.447
<i>- But you wanna--</i>

03:17.530 --> 03:19.324
yeah, be careful
because it's very heavy.

03:19.407 --> 03:21.659
- On the side?
- Yeah. Is that on?

03:21.743 --> 03:23.202
- Perfect.

03:23.286 --> 03:25.496
[clatters loudly]

03:25.580 --> 03:27.665
Is that plugged in?

03:27.749 --> 03:29.751
- No.
Oh, man.

03:29.834 --> 03:32.587
- It's gonna take a lot
less time if we plug it in

03:32.670 --> 03:34.505
to make the dough
with electricity there.

03:34.589 --> 03:37.717
- Makes sense.
- I'm just not coordinated.

03:37.800 --> 03:39.385
- We like to watch
the struggle.

03:39.469 --> 03:41.054
<i>- You're doing great.</i>
- She got it plugged in.

03:41.137 --> 03:42.347
- Okay.
- We're in business.

03:42.430 --> 03:44.223
- Fantastic.
There is two lever.

03:44.307 --> 03:47.101
One locks it, one turns it on.
See, that didn't work.

03:47.185 --> 03:49.479
- It fell off.
- I'm sorry.

03:49.562 --> 03:51.940
- One of the two black lever
is gonna lock the head.

03:52.023 --> 03:53.942
You gotta
move it forward, I think.

03:54.025 --> 03:57.487
- Oh, that's why.
- Hey.

03:57.570 --> 03:59.280
<i>- Now it's locked.</i>
- Whoo.

03:59.364 --> 04:01.407
Do you have a cup
just like this?

04:01.491 --> 04:02.867
- Yes.
- What we need right now

04:02.951 --> 04:05.995
is about a cup
and a half of water.

04:06.079 --> 04:07.914
Faucet water is perfect.

04:07.997 --> 04:10.458
I mean, I grew up drinking
from a hose anyway so.

04:10.541 --> 04:14.963
- God, I hope this is right.
- I sent you yeast.

04:15.046 --> 04:18.841
Yeast is the key
for great pizza making.

04:18.925 --> 04:21.052
Its right in front of you,
I see it from here.

04:21.135 --> 04:25.640
If you extend your left hand
I'll guide you to it.

04:25.723 --> 04:28.518
Further out, further out,
further out, further out.

04:28.601 --> 04:30.853
Further out, further--
- No.

04:30.937 --> 04:33.272
- No, that's bread.
- Not the parmesan.

04:33.356 --> 04:35.358
- Right, right there.
Right there.

04:35.441 --> 04:37.735
[cheering]
There you go.

04:37.819 --> 04:40.446
All right.
So get two of those.

04:40.530 --> 04:42.615
Yeast is one of the key
ingredient for it.

04:42.699 --> 04:45.576
- Hang on. I accidentally
dropped some yeast.

04:45.660 --> 04:47.412
- The yeast has gotta be
in the water to work.

04:47.495 --> 04:49.455
The cou--the counter
is not gonna work well.

04:49.539 --> 04:53.001
- There it goes on the floor.
Bye-bye yeast.

04:53.084 --> 04:56.170
- Get like this, look.
Get the yeast in the water.

04:56.254 --> 04:59.173
Two little packages, okay?
Look at that.

04:59.257 --> 05:01.384
Now you got a tablespoon
of sugar in the water

05:01.467 --> 05:03.302
to activate the yeast.

05:03.386 --> 05:07.348
- One tables--
that's not right.

05:07.432 --> 05:11.019
- Trust me, get a soup spoon.
Measuring is for beginner.

05:11.102 --> 05:13.229
We're, like, seasoned veterans
of pizza dough here.

05:13.312 --> 05:14.897
- Okay.

05:14.981 --> 05:16.899
<i>- Just get a tablespoon</i>
<i>of sugar into the yeast water.</i>

05:16.983 --> 05:18.151
- Got it.

05:18.234 --> 05:20.069
- Now, with
the very same spoon,

05:20.153 --> 05:21.529
stir it like this.

05:21.612 --> 05:24.073
- Why does it look like
you have more than us?

05:24.157 --> 05:25.742
<i>- Because mine is smaller.</i>

05:25.825 --> 05:27.618
<i>You have a Chipmunk's</i>
<i>bathtub there</i>

05:27.702 --> 05:29.078
instead of a measuring cup.

05:29.162 --> 05:31.080
- Got it.
- Ah.

05:31.164 --> 05:34.083
- We gotta set this aside
for about five minutes.

05:34.167 --> 05:35.376
Do you got flour there?

05:35.460 --> 05:37.795
- Yes, I do.
Okay.

05:37.879 --> 05:39.464
- Open it.
- Oh.

05:39.547 --> 05:41.716
- You can open the flour.
Please. I feel so bossy today.

05:41.799 --> 05:43.760
- It's okay.
- We love it.

05:43.843 --> 05:45.636
- We don't know
what we're doing, so...

05:45.720 --> 05:46.971
- Nope.

05:47.055 --> 05:48.598
- All right, get another
soup spoon for yourself.

05:48.681 --> 05:50.349
And I--and I wanna--I wanna
show you something.

05:50.433 --> 05:54.062
America sells a bunch of crap
that nobody needs.

05:54.145 --> 05:56.189
All you need in Italy
is a spoon.

05:56.272 --> 05:57.690
They're spoons, all right?

05:57.774 --> 06:00.276
So this is
an Italian tablespoon.

06:00.359 --> 06:02.820
You just stick
the spoon in and just lift.

06:02.904 --> 06:05.573
Whatever comes up
is an Italian tablespoon.

06:05.656 --> 06:07.116
There you go.

06:07.200 --> 06:10.828
Now, you're gonna get
eight Italian tablespoon

06:10.912 --> 06:13.372
in a little side container
like this.

06:13.456 --> 06:14.665
- Eight?
<i>- Eight of those.</i>

06:14.749 --> 06:15.875
- Eight of those.

06:15.958 --> 06:18.628
- Get your--
get your olive oil.

06:18.711 --> 06:21.839
<i>You need good,</i>
<i>good tasting olive oil.</i>

06:21.923 --> 06:23.674
Do you like olive oil?
Extra virgin olive oil?

06:23.758 --> 06:26.302
<i>Are you familiar with them?</i>
- I love olive oil.

06:26.385 --> 06:28.054
- You know, I take--
I take shots

06:28.137 --> 06:29.972
of olive oil all the time.

06:30.056 --> 06:32.183
- What?
- Such a chef.

06:32.266 --> 06:33.810
- You think I'm kidding.

06:33.893 --> 06:36.979
- No, don't do it.
Oh, my gosh.

06:37.063 --> 06:38.481
- Should we take a shot?

06:38.564 --> 06:40.191
- Yeah,
you have to do it too.

06:40.274 --> 06:43.027
- If you're doing it,
I feel like we should do it.

06:43.111 --> 06:44.695
- Yeah.

06:44.779 --> 06:46.739
<i>- Yeah, you can have</i>
<i>a tablespoon if you want to.</i>

06:46.823 --> 06:49.033
- Thanks for signing us
up for that.

08:31.844 --> 08:33.804
<i>♪ Si' stata</i>
<i>'o primmo ammore ♪</i>

08:33.888 --> 08:35.723
- We love "Oje Vita Mia."

08:35.806 --> 08:38.726
- Now the dough is dry,
all right?

08:38.809 --> 08:41.020
Can you touch it now?
Does it still stick?

08:41.103 --> 08:42.230
- No.

08:42.313 --> 08:44.190
<i>- Perfect.</i>
<i>All right.</i>

08:44.273 --> 08:46.567
Now, you wanna get a bowl,
something like this.

08:46.651 --> 08:48.069
- Okay.

08:48.152 --> 08:51.030
- Like, a little glass bowl
or metal bowl.

08:51.113 --> 08:52.782
- This?
- That is perfect.

08:52.865 --> 08:54.367
- Okay.

08:54.450 --> 08:57.828
- And now the goal is to get
the dough in the bowl there.

08:57.912 --> 08:59.956
- It's messy time.
- Yeah, you know what?

09:00.039 --> 09:01.958
I think it's time
for some help.

09:02.041 --> 09:04.585
- What?
- [chuckles mischievously]

09:07.546 --> 09:10.007
- Oh, wow, it really does
feel like Play-Doh.

09:10.091 --> 09:11.884
- So you have this
in the bowl, correct?

09:11.968 --> 09:13.427
- Yes.

09:13.511 --> 09:15.471
- Now what we do,
we cover it with plastic.

09:15.554 --> 09:18.641
You have, like, plastic wrap?
Plastic wrap too?

09:18.724 --> 09:21.352
- Oh, my gosh,
I hate this stuff.

09:21.435 --> 09:24.981
- So look.
You just cover it with plastic.

09:25.064 --> 09:27.149
And what you do with this--

09:27.233 --> 09:29.068
- Hang on.

09:29.151 --> 09:32.488
Okay. Okay. Wait.

09:32.572 --> 09:35.032
- She's totally talking
to herself.

09:35.116 --> 09:37.451
- Oh yeah.

09:37.535 --> 09:39.537
- Sorry.

09:39.620 --> 09:41.706
- Oh, my God.
-<i> You can use a knife--</i>

09:41.789 --> 09:45.001
- Wait.
What the hell?

09:45.084 --> 09:47.086
- It's making me mad.

09:47.169 --> 09:48.838
- It's cause you're doing--
wait.

09:48.921 --> 09:51.424
What?
<i>- Try with a--</i>

09:51.507 --> 09:53.926
try with a chainsaw.

09:54.010 --> 09:55.803
- We're good. We're good.
We're good.

09:55.886 --> 09:57.972
- See, you get it aligned.

09:58.055 --> 09:59.849
Okay, got it.
<i>- I'll tell you what though,</i>

09:59.932 --> 10:02.018
that's a strong
plastic wrap there, damn.

10:02.101 --> 10:03.436
- Yeah. Yeah.

10:03.519 --> 10:05.980
- All right,
so now this dough

10:06.063 --> 10:09.692
is gonna rest on your
kitchen counter overnight.

10:09.775 --> 10:11.360
- Oh.

10:11.444 --> 10:14.572
- So we are off
the hook till tomorrow.

10:14.655 --> 10:16.240
And then once the dough
is ready,

10:16.324 --> 10:20.620
we can shape that
and we can make pizza.

10:20.703 --> 10:22.204
- Amazing.

10:22.288 --> 10:24.415
- Well, we can't do that,
right?

10:24.498 --> 10:25.708
- What do you mean?

10:25.791 --> 10:28.210
- We can't
go to sleep right now.

10:28.294 --> 10:29.879
- Well, we're not
going to sleep.

10:29.962 --> 10:31.964
It's like--by me it's, like,
3:00 in the afternoon.

10:32.048 --> 10:33.758
It's, like, what, 1:00 by you?

10:33.841 --> 10:36.469
- I don't know. I don't--
Maybe I just need coffee.

10:36.552 --> 10:38.220
- [laughs]
- I'm kidding.

10:38.304 --> 10:41.223
The dough will have to proof
overnight to be able to use it.

10:41.307 --> 10:43.893
But I sent you
the premade pizza dough.

10:43.976 --> 10:46.062
- Ooh.

10:46.145 --> 10:48.689
- Ooh, you are a legend.

10:48.773 --> 10:50.232
- So open that.

10:50.316 --> 10:52.276
- Oh, it's way
prettier than ours.

10:52.360 --> 10:53.736
- Wow, stunning.
- Perfect.

10:53.819 --> 10:55.321
Ours would have
never looked like that.

10:55.404 --> 10:57.823
- It looks like an ass.
- Oh, my God.

10:57.907 --> 10:59.450
- Wait, wait, wait.

10:59.533 --> 11:01.952
Inappropriate over here.
<i>- It's perfect.</i>

11:02.036 --> 11:03.287
- It's not focusing.

11:03.371 --> 11:06.707
- Wait.
- Oh, my gosh.

11:06.791 --> 11:08.626
Sorry Fabio for being--

11:08.709 --> 11:11.295
<i>- No, no, no.</i>
<i>It's perfect.</i>

11:11.379 --> 11:12.671
- Oh, my gosh.

11:12.755 --> 11:13.923
- Okay, sorry.

11:14.006 --> 11:15.549
- Do you have a pan
like this?

11:15.633 --> 11:18.636
Like, an oven pan.
That's non-stick, right?

11:18.719 --> 11:20.429
- Yes.
- Perfect.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.473
All right.
So what I want you to do,

11:22.556 --> 11:24.558
<i>I want you to get</i>
<i>a little bit of olive oil</i>

11:24.642 --> 11:27.561
and put about a tablespoon
on the pan.

11:27.645 --> 11:29.939
That's perfect.
Spread the olive oil

11:30.022 --> 11:33.776
around to cover
all the bottom of the pan.

11:33.859 --> 11:35.194
- Okay.

11:35.277 --> 11:37.363
<i>- So now get one of</i>
<i>the pizza ball</i>

11:37.446 --> 11:41.075
and put it
in the middle of the pan.

11:41.158 --> 11:42.701
- Okay.
- Then you can get

11:42.785 --> 11:46.956
a touch of olive oil
on top of the pizza dough.

11:47.039 --> 11:49.250
And that will help you
to press it down

11:49.333 --> 11:51.544
without getting your fingers
sticking to it.

11:51.627 --> 11:52.962
- Okay.

11:53.045 --> 11:55.089
- Now, press it down
like this like I did.

11:55.172 --> 11:56.549
- She's loving it.

11:56.632 --> 11:58.467
<i>- This is gonna be</i>
<i>for the focaccia.</i>

11:58.551 --> 12:01.679
So let's get ready
for the topping

12:01.762 --> 12:03.472
that we're gonna do
for the focaccia.

12:03.556 --> 12:07.977
In the fresh herbs I sent you
there is a bunch of rosemary.

12:08.060 --> 12:09.562
- Smells amazing.

12:09.645 --> 12:12.940
- The best way to peel
the rosemary is to hold the top

12:13.023 --> 12:15.484
and slide your finger
through it like this.

12:15.568 --> 12:18.529
[whistles]
- Oh, my God.

12:18.612 --> 12:19.780
- Okay, I think we--

12:19.864 --> 12:21.866
I think I did it.
- You got it.

12:21.949 --> 12:23.409
<i>Yeah, that's plenty,</i>
<i>plenty of rosemary.</i>

12:23.492 --> 12:24.952
- Good job.
<i>- That's perfect.</i>

12:25.035 --> 12:27.246
Now, put the rosemary
to cover

12:27.329 --> 12:30.416
as much of the focaccia
as you can.

12:30.499 --> 12:32.418
- Oh, yummy.

12:32.501 --> 12:34.086
<i>- That's good. That is good.</i>
<i>All right.</i>

12:34.170 --> 12:36.839
<i>So now get the olive oil</i>
<i>that we all love.</i>

12:36.922 --> 12:39.383
<i>Give it a good drizzle</i>
<i>on top of your pizza.</i>

12:39.467 --> 12:41.844
<i>All right?</i>
- Nice.

12:41.927 --> 12:43.846
- Now, let's get the salt.

12:43.929 --> 12:46.682
Get the flaky salt.
Don't go too light on it.

12:46.765 --> 12:48.350
- She's going wild.

12:48.434 --> 12:49.894
- Perfect.
Fantastic.

12:49.977 --> 12:52.062
Gonna throw a little
pepper on it.

12:52.146 --> 12:54.106
- Okay.
- And that's it.

12:54.190 --> 12:55.858
- Oh, my gosh,
this looks so good.

12:55.941 --> 12:57.401
- I know, yum.

12:57.485 --> 13:00.112
- All right. So now we're
gonna stick that in the oven

13:00.196 --> 13:03.199
and put it on the higher rack
if you can.

13:03.282 --> 13:04.950
- Yes. Whoo.

13:05.034 --> 13:08.412
- Now that we have to wait
for the focaccia to cook,

13:08.496 --> 13:12.374
let's make fresh
cherry tomato jam...

13:12.458 --> 13:14.251
<i>- Ooh.</i>
<i>- Whoo!</i>

13:14.335 --> 13:18.506
<i>- ...that is gonna pair</i>
<i>with our burrata appetizer.</i>

13:18.589 --> 13:19.840
<i>- Amazing.</i>

13:19.924 --> 13:21.383
<i>- You're good with that?</i>
- Hell yeah.

13:21.467 --> 13:23.344
- A few things
I would like you

13:23.427 --> 13:25.930
to have ready to roll
on your counter.

13:26.013 --> 13:29.391
Cherry tomato, garlic,

13:29.475 --> 13:32.561
brown sugar and honey.

13:32.645 --> 13:37.650
And then you're gonna get
five or six cloves of garlic.

13:37.733 --> 13:38.943
- Yummy.

13:39.026 --> 13:41.737
- One other thing you're
gonna need is a pan.

13:43.364 --> 13:47.368
Do you have anything less tall,
more like a sauté pan for you?

13:49.161 --> 13:50.704
No.

13:50.788 --> 13:54.083
- Oh, my God. Or this?
- Ahh!

13:54.166 --> 13:55.584
- Look at that.
- Whoo!

13:55.668 --> 13:56.919
- That's the one.
Perfect.

13:57.002 --> 13:58.420
- All right.
<i>- All right.</i>

13:58.504 --> 14:02.424
So now you're gonna have
your sauté pan

14:02.508 --> 14:06.095
<i>with low fire underneath.</i>
- Okay.

14:06.178 --> 14:09.139
- Get at least
25, 30 cherry tomato

14:09.223 --> 14:12.268
and literally just
cut them in half.

14:12.351 --> 14:14.603
[laughter]

14:14.687 --> 14:16.063
- It fell.

14:16.146 --> 14:17.439
One down.

14:17.523 --> 14:19.275
Are we counting how many?

14:19.358 --> 14:20.693
- We need to sharpen
these knives.

14:20.776 --> 14:22.069
- I know.

14:22.152 --> 14:23.654
<i>- So do you wanna hear</i>
<i>a funny story?</i>

14:23.737 --> 14:24.863
- Yes, I do.

14:24.947 --> 14:26.365
<i>- So I'm 13 years old.</i>

14:26.448 --> 14:30.077
I got a job at a butcher shop
on a weekend.

14:30.160 --> 14:32.746
I had a knife
just about like that.

14:32.830 --> 14:33.872
Big knife, right?

14:33.956 --> 14:35.457
- Yeah.
<i>- Big knife.</i>

14:35.541 --> 14:38.294
I used to work from midnight
till 7:00 in the morning.

14:38.377 --> 14:41.297
Middle of the night
I'm the only kid in the shop.

14:41.380 --> 14:44.300
I have a headset.
I have heavy metal music,

14:44.383 --> 14:47.303
and I'm there butchering
chicken banging things

14:47.386 --> 14:48.887
with heavy metal.

14:48.971 --> 14:54.226
And I look down and
my entire pinky was about

14:54.310 --> 14:55.936
two and a half feet
away from me on the table.

14:56.020 --> 14:58.647
- No!
- Oh, my gosh.

14:58.731 --> 15:01.650
- So I went down and I just
cut a slice through it.

15:01.734 --> 15:03.193
- Ugh.
- And I don't know

15:03.277 --> 15:05.571
if you can see but I had,
like, few surgery.

15:05.654 --> 15:07.114
They reattached it back.

15:07.197 --> 15:08.574
I just--you know,
it's great now.

15:08.657 --> 15:10.409
But it was gone.
It was gone.

15:10.492 --> 15:12.202
- Oh, my God.

15:12.286 --> 15:16.707
- So I had my share
of kitchen accidents, trust me.

15:16.790 --> 15:18.334
<i>All right,</i>
<i>so what you wanna do,</i>

15:18.417 --> 15:21.003
add about two tablespoon
of olive oil in the pan.

15:21.086 --> 15:23.255
Get the fire on medium.

15:23.339 --> 15:26.634
And now add all the tomato
in the pan.

15:26.717 --> 15:28.052
- Okay.

15:28.135 --> 15:30.846
- Good pinch of salt
in the tomato.

15:30.929 --> 15:33.682
And a good pinch of pepper.
Fantastic.

15:33.766 --> 15:35.225
- Yay.
<i>- All right.</i>

15:35.309 --> 15:36.935
So now the tomato
is cooking, right?

15:37.019 --> 15:38.187
Can you hear the sizzle?

15:38.270 --> 15:41.482
- Yes, I can.
- Get a knife.

15:41.565 --> 15:45.903
<i>And you wanna smash the garlic</i>
<i>with the side of the knife.</i>

15:47.196 --> 15:48.989
- All right.
<i>- Perfect.</i>

15:49.073 --> 15:53.035
All right, so now the garlic
goes into the tomato.

15:53.118 --> 15:56.038
- Yes. I love garlic.

15:56.121 --> 16:00.668
- See now one nice soup spoon
of honey and put that in.

16:00.751 --> 16:02.211
<i>Fantastic.</i>

16:02.294 --> 16:04.922
Now we're gonna add
almost a tablespoon of sugar.

16:05.005 --> 16:06.882
- This is gonna be so good.
<i>- Perfect. That's it.</i>

16:06.965 --> 16:09.218
All right.
So now with the spoon, stir.

16:09.301 --> 16:10.636
- Oh, my God, what happened?

16:10.719 --> 16:12.054
<i>- What happened?</i>
<i>Are you all right?</i>

16:12.137 --> 16:13.681
- Nothing,
I was really dramatic.

16:13.764 --> 16:15.349
- It's okay, we got the yeast
in the brown sugar

16:15.432 --> 16:16.975
on the floor.

16:17.059 --> 16:19.061
If you put some water
and flour, you get focaccia.

16:19.144 --> 16:22.731
All right, so now get
a little wooden spoon.

16:22.815 --> 16:26.276
In America, wooden spoons
are cooking tools.

16:26.360 --> 16:27.861
It's just a tool.

16:27.945 --> 16:31.615
How I grew up, this is a mood
adjustment device.

16:31.699 --> 16:35.160
Growing up with an Italian mom,
every time she had this

16:35.244 --> 16:38.247
in her hand
everybody freezes in my family.

16:38.330 --> 16:40.290
'Cause you know
that you misbehave,

16:40.374 --> 16:42.459
you get whacked with a wooden
spoon in Italy.

16:42.543 --> 16:43.794
- Oh, my gosh.

16:43.877 --> 16:45.671
- Grandmothers and
wooden spoon in Italy,

16:45.754 --> 16:47.214
is like guns and tequilas.

16:47.297 --> 16:50.342
They should never be
in the same room.

16:50.426 --> 16:51.927
- So funny.

16:52.010 --> 16:53.971
- All right, so get the spoon
and stir the tomato

16:54.054 --> 16:57.933
and trying to incorporate
the honey with the rest

16:58.016 --> 17:00.185
<i>of what you got</i>
<i>in the pan there.</i>

17:00.269 --> 17:03.105
Make sure
it's nicely incorporated.

17:03.188 --> 17:04.565
<i>Exactly. Perfect.</i>

17:04.648 --> 17:08.026
Let's turn it off.
And tomato jam, its ready.

17:08.110 --> 17:11.697
We just have to let it
cool down a little bit.

17:11.780 --> 17:13.532
Okay?
- Okay.

17:13.615 --> 17:16.910
- So what do you do for that?
You put tomato jam into a bowl.

17:16.994 --> 17:19.371
<i>And you use a spoon</i>
<i>and you just put that in.</i>

17:19.455 --> 17:20.622
<i>Perfect.</i>

17:20.706 --> 17:22.624
- Oh, it's hot.
- Here, I'll do it.

17:22.708 --> 17:24.835
Just get out of my way.
- It was on the stove.

17:24.918 --> 17:28.589
- As you can see, Selena,
my focaccia is ready.

17:28.672 --> 17:32.301

27:22.807 --> 27:24.225
- Should we try
the other stuff too?

27:24.309 --> 27:26.061
- I wanna like--
- Save it for everyone?

27:26.144 --> 27:28.396
<i>- You can.</i>
- Mmm.

27:28.480 --> 27:30.106
- Whoo!
[laughter]

27:30.190 --> 27:32.108
- This is so good.

27:32.192 --> 27:34.110
- Selena, can you
give me a "(Michael)"?

27:34.194 --> 27:36.571
- This is my favorite meal
I've ever made.

27:38.490 --> 27:41.242
- It's so good.
- Thank you.

27:41.326 --> 27:43.661
- Fabio, we actually have
some friends coming over.

27:43.745 --> 27:45.747
We're gonna do, like,
a game night.

27:45.830 --> 27:49.584
So I basically wanna
save this for them.

27:49.667 --> 27:54.130
But I wanna thank you so much
for the lesson today.

27:54.214 --> 27:56.091
And I'm so grateful

27:56.174 --> 28:00.136
because I'm gonna be
showing this off for damn sure.

28:00.220 --> 28:02.931
- I appreciate it very much.
Thank you so much.

28:03.014 --> 28:04.766
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>I mean, this was great.</i>

28:04.849 --> 28:06.601
Had a lot of fun
doing this video.

28:06.684 --> 28:08.978
- Well, thank you so much.
Have a great day.

28:09.062 --> 28:10.688
<i>- Bye.</i>
- You too, hon.

28:10.772 --> 28:12.065
<i>- Bye.</i>
- Bye, guys.

28:12.148 --> 28:13.900
Thank you very much.
<i>- Thank you.</i>

28:13.983 --> 28:17.278
- Fox, Paige,
my little sister.

28:17.362 --> 28:19.489
It's game night.

28:19.572 --> 28:21.533
- Pizza time.

28:21.616 --> 28:23.368
- It smells so good.
- Here.

28:23.451 --> 28:25.453
- Wonderful, I'm gonna take
the best looking piece.

28:25.537 --> 28:27.497
All right.
Moment of truth guys.

28:27.580 --> 28:28.832
- Is it good?

28:28.915 --> 28:30.959
- Who's going next?
- Mmm, mmm.

28:31.042 --> 28:32.544
- It's so good.
- Really?

28:32.627 --> 28:35.130
- It's, like, perfectly
toasted too.

28:35.213 --> 28:36.756
I feel like
it's all over my face.

28:36.840 --> 28:38.299
- This is a good pizza.

28:38.383 --> 28:39.926
- Do you like it?
- Mm-hmm.

28:40.009 --> 28:43.388
- I love this Jenga.
- Do you love it?

28:43.471 --> 28:45.598
- Yes...

28:45.682 --> 28:48.268
- A lot of basil?

28:48.351 --> 28:49.519
- That's my--okay.

28:49.602 --> 28:51.855
That's my critique
from my sister.

28:53.898 --> 28:55.483
- Oh, my gosh!

28:55.567 --> 28:57.152
- That's so embarrassing.
- It's in the pizza!
