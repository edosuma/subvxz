Yeah .

12:34.462 --> 12:38.090
James, Spencer, Marsden ,

12:38.591 --> 12:41.135

12:49.185 --> 12:51.145
Something's wrong
with the gate.

12:51.438 --> 12:55.732
Rush doesn't think
we can risk using it,
even with what's happened .

13:02.782 --> 13:08.745
We can't reach Destiny on
radio, either, so apparently
we're trapped here.

13:11.082 --> 13:14.376
There's 22 hours
until Destiny jumps back
into FTL.

13:19.716 --> 13:22.217
The creatures
seem to be nocturnal .

13:23.011 --> 13:25.721
They stopped coming
once the sun came up.

13:26.097 --> 13:30.100
Hopefully, the gate
will start working
before it gets dark again .

13:31.186 --> 13:35.063
Apparently, we don't have
much ammunition left.

RUSH : Eli , what are you doing?

13:50.163 --> 13:52.748
ELl : Volker wasn't killed
by the creatures.

13:52.832 --> 13:55.667
T.J . says he died
of the illness
during the night.

13:55.752 --> 13:57.002
Everyone seems
to be coming down

13:57.086 --> 13:59.004

with symptoms
at this point. . .

13:59.339 --> 14:03.717

yet again that documenting
this could be important?

by one of the creatures.

14:25.240 --> 14:26.782
He's now in a coma.

We are under quarantine.

14:38.461 --> 14:41.088
Sergeant Greer has
found a cave nearby.

14:42.048 --> 14:46.802
lt could be our best chance
to survive another night
if it comes down to that.

a defensible position .

15:04.821 --> 15:06.113

on all sides.

can't help people.

lt does.

15:37.145 --> 15:38.854
ELl : My mom was a nurse.

15:39.939 --> 15:43.942
She got stuck by a needle
trying to restrain a junkie
in the ER.

15:45.862 --> 15:47.279
She got HIV.

15:50.033 --> 15:51.366
JOHANSEN: I'm sorry.

15:53.745 --> 15:55.621
ELl : My father
couldn't handle it.

15:55.705 --> 15:58.081
He just. . . He just left.

15:59.751 --> 16:01.627
ELl : l was 1 4 at the time.

16:01.711 --> 16:03.211
That must have been
hard on you .

16:06.299 --> 16:07.924
ELl : Do you have
a family?

16:09.052 --> 16:11.720
My parents.
My dad's retired .

16:12.263 --> 16:14.014
ELl : (CH UCKLES)
What did he do?

16:14.098 --> 16:15.515
He was a tailor.

16:16.100 --> 16:19.144
He's actually the one
who taught me
how to do stitches.

16:19.228 --> 16:23.398
l remember this one time
he cut himself pretty badly
with some scissors,

16:24.525 --> 16:27.402
and he sewed it up himself
and kept right on working .

16:30.073 --> 16:31.448
ELl : Brothers or sisters?

16:31.532 --> 16:34.618
A sister.
She has two kids.

16:35.912 --> 16:37.329
l miss them .

16:40.750 --> 16:45.170
ELl : l'm really afraid that
my mom's just gonna give up
if l die out here.

16:57.392 --> 17:02.312
ELl : l remember as a kid ,
l was, l don't know,
maybe seven or eight,

17:02.480 --> 17:06.441
my grandfather died ,
and my parents took me
to the funeral .

17:07.402 --> 17:10.529
Watching his casket
getting lowered
into the ground ,

17:10.613 --> 17:15.659
it was the first time
that l realized l was
going to die one day.

17:16.077 --> 17:18.412
l mean , l knew people died .

17:18.496 --> 17:23.333
l'm talking about the idea
that my consciousness
was going to end .

17:23.835 --> 17:27.128
l wasn't going to see
what happened
to the world . l . . .

17:28.548 --> 17:32.467
lt was such an empty,
dark feeling ,

17:33.344 --> 17:38.515
like l was falling down
a pitch-black hole. lt was. . .
Scared the crap out of me.

17:39.142 --> 17:41.518
l take it you don't
believe in the afterlife.

17:42.979 --> 17:47.232
ELI : That fear was
almost too much to handle.

17:47.567 --> 17:50.736
l guess maybe l thought
l'd just get used to it.

17:51.738 --> 17:53.989
But you don't.
ELl : No.

17:54.449 --> 17:58.326
No, it scared me
just as much every time.

17:59.620 --> 18:01.538
RUSH: Most people realize
their own mortality

18:01.622 --> 18:02.748
at some stage
of the game, Eli.

18:02.832 --> 18:05.417
lt's not a particularly
unique experience.

18:05.501 --> 18:06.918
ELI : I know.

18:07.003 --> 18:10.297
The question is,
did it change you?

18:11.883 --> 18:16.386
Did it inspire you to
make something of this short
existence that we have?

18:17.096 --> 18:20.515
ELl : Well , l'm here,
aren't l?

18:23.770 --> 18:28.940
Of course, the Ancients
evolved to a point where
their physical bodies

18:29.025 --> 18:31.109
were no longer necessary,

18:31.986 --> 18:35.155
found a way for consciousness
to become immortal .

18:36.783 --> 18:38.950
ELl : You really think
that's possible?

18:41.537 --> 18:43.038
l know it is.

18:47.043 --> 18:50.712
Maybe not for you and me,
but that idea,

18:53.382 --> 18:56.134
it's the reason
why l ended up here.

18:57.470 --> 19:02.390
ELl : So, you think if we
learn enough , that somehow,

19:03.309 --> 19:07.896
somewhere out there
we could discover
how it's done?

19:13.861 --> 19:15.821
We have to make it
through the day.

19:27.583 --> 19:29.125

19:29.210 --> 19:31.837
Well , it's not clear
what happened .

19:32.588 --> 19:36.341

planet and have all those
people die under my watch .

19:36.425 --> 19:38.093
lt wasn't your fault,
Sergeant.

19:38.845 --> 19:41.263
lt didn't look like
there was anything you
could have done differently.

19:41.347 --> 19:44.558

in what did not happen .

that recording came
into existence,

We just don't go back
to that planet.

lt's been three hours
since we dropped out of FTL.

20:30.313 --> 20:34.816

Eli said Volker
died because of it.

powerful enough ,

was just too small .

28:19.865 --> 28:21.574
Well , it isn't now.

28:21.658 --> 28:24.077
lt's possible that
a batch of water

to pass from the blood

31:27.803 --> 31:30.471
RUSH : A solar flare.
lt's the only explanation .

31:31.014 --> 31:34.350
lf a wormhole's trajectory
takes it too close to a star

31:34.434 --> 31:37.061
and it passes through
an active solar flare,

31:37.145 --> 31:39.939
it can cause it to
move forwards
or backwards in time.

31:40.023 --> 31:43.526
ln some cases, the wormhole
can actually loop back around

31:43.610 --> 31:47.989
and connect to the same gate
in a different time.
ln this case, the past.

31:48.824 --> 31:53.411

The "us" on that recording
dropped out of FTL
and went to the planet.

Sometime later, a solar flare
occurred preventing
normal gate travel .

32:08.510 --> 32:12.597

he was sending the Kino
back to the Destiny,

32:12.848 --> 32:16.684

sending it back to
the planet but in the past.

disrupted gate travel
