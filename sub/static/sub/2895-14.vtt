WEBVTT

00:01.468 --> 00:03.870
So I sign this and the bribery
allegations are gone?

00:03.904 --> 00:05.537
And no one ever knows
a thing.

00:05.572 --> 00:08.241
You never let me tell you
what the money was for.

00:08.275 --> 00:10.442
You didn't listen to me
when I told you I don't care.

00:10.477 --> 00:12.278
Well, do you care
that after Mike grilled me,

00:12.312 --> 00:15.047
I was so impressed with him that
I wonder why I'd forgotten him?

00:15.082 --> 00:19.685
But I couldn't find any record
of him ever being in my class.

00:19.719 --> 00:21.787
Just like they're not gonna
find any record of you

00:21.821 --> 00:23.655
accepting a bribe
from a student.

00:23.690 --> 00:26.425
Jessica, your secret
is safe with me.

00:27.560 --> 00:29.495
I told him you found out

00:29.529 --> 00:32.264
that I covered up
Daniel Hardman's embezzlement.

00:32.298 --> 00:34.500
And now you want me to protect
another one of your secrets.

00:34.534 --> 00:36.735
It's the same secret, Louis,

00:36.770 --> 00:38.704
and you have just as much
invested in it as I do.

00:38.738 --> 00:40.939
You want me to kiss the ring,
Louis, after what you did?

00:40.973 --> 00:42.340
You're damn right I do,

00:42.375 --> 00:44.276
because I don't care
how it got up there.

00:44.310 --> 00:48.780
My name is on that wall
whether you like it or not.

♪

01:07.433 --> 01:09.967
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:10.001 --> 01:12.169
What do you think
of this tie?

01:12.203 --> 01:13.904
I think...

01:13.938 --> 01:17.140
I want to
tie you up with it.

01:17.174 --> 01:23.046
Really?
And what brought that on?

01:23.080 --> 01:25.515
Okay, well,

01:25.550 --> 01:28.718
then let's make

01:28.753 --> 01:31.855
that happen.

01:31.889 --> 01:33.323
Wait.

01:33.357 --> 01:34.524
Is this to do things
to me

01:34.559 --> 01:36.125
or just to get control
of the remote?

01:36.160 --> 01:37.761
Why can't it be both?

01:37.795 --> 01:40.463
Rachel, if you think I'm gonna
let you watch <i>Game of Thrones</i>

01:40.497 --> 01:42.030
while sexually dominating me,

01:42.065 --> 01:45.067
then you are absolutely right.

01:47.604 --> 01:50.706
Seriously, what's got you
feeling so good?

01:50.740 --> 01:52.140
Oh, it just feels like
such a weight off

01:52.175 --> 01:53.408
now that Louis doesn't--

01:53.443 --> 01:55.077
- Despise me?
- Mm-hmm.

01:55.111 --> 01:57.179
Ah, you know what else
would feel like a weight off?

01:59.649 --> 02:01.684
- Oh--
- No. No, no, no.

02:01.718 --> 02:03.519
Nobody ever calls
the landline except my parents.

02:03.553 --> 02:05.187
- What if something's wrong?
- It's fine.

02:05.221 --> 02:06.221
Mike.

02:06.255 --> 02:08.590
Okay, okay, okay.

02:08.624 --> 02:09.991
Hello.

02:10.026 --> 02:11.994
Yeah, this is him.

02:14.630 --> 02:17.199
Yeah, of course
I can come meet you.

02:17.233 --> 02:20.469
Can I ask what this is--
hello?

02:20.503 --> 02:21.536
Who was it?

02:21.570 --> 02:23.005
Professor Gerard.

02:23.039 --> 02:24.572
He wants me to go meet him.

02:24.607 --> 02:25.807
Did he say
what it was about?

02:25.841 --> 02:27.442
No, he hung up.

02:27.477 --> 02:29.044
When does he want you
to meet him?

02:29.078 --> 02:30.212
Right now.

02:32.615 --> 02:36.884
- Professor Gerard.
- Thanks for coming.

02:36.918 --> 02:38.819
I wouldn't have bothered you
if it wasn't important.

02:38.853 --> 02:40.854
It's not a problem.
What can I help you with?

02:40.889 --> 02:42.623
It's not me.

02:42.657 --> 02:45.993
A former employee at
Liberty Rail reached out to me.

02:46.028 --> 02:47.594
He claims he was fired
because he knows

02:47.629 --> 02:49.430
the real reason
for the crash.

02:49.464 --> 02:52.333
And what was
the real reason?

02:52.367 --> 02:53.700
He wouldn't tell me.

02:53.735 --> 02:54.902
Well, what did he
tell you?

02:54.936 --> 02:57.138
Enough for me to know
it would be unethical

02:57.172 --> 03:00.541
if somebody didn't
look into this.

03:00.575 --> 03:03.744
But you can't, so you want me
to get Harvey to.

03:03.778 --> 03:06.013
Well, you convinced him
to look into my case

03:06.048 --> 03:07.248
when he didn't want to,
didn't you?

03:07.282 --> 03:09.616
This is different.
We don't take cases like this.

03:09.651 --> 03:12.653
Maybe,

03:12.687 --> 03:15.622
but I believe a man
who can convince Harvey

03:15.657 --> 03:17.490
to hire someone
who never went to law school

03:17.525 --> 03:20.360
could convince him
to make an exception for this.

03:22.329 --> 03:25.032
What?

03:25.066 --> 03:26.900
He didn't tell you I know.

03:29.437 --> 03:30.671
No, he didn't.

03:30.705 --> 03:33.006
Well, I do.

03:34.909 --> 03:38.812
But what I'm asking you to do
and me knowing

03:38.846 --> 03:40.980
have nothing
to do with each other.

03:43.750 --> 03:45.184
I appreciate that.

03:45.218 --> 03:48.287
Does that mean that you're
gonna tell him to take the case?

03:48.321 --> 03:49.889
I have a better idea.

03:55.428 --> 03:56.963
Got a second?

03:56.997 --> 03:59.231
Of course.
What do you need?

03:59.265 --> 04:02.068
I'd like you to sign off
on my vacation request.

04:04.404 --> 04:06.138
Paris.

04:06.172 --> 04:07.739
I've never heard you
talk about Paris.

04:07.773 --> 04:11.176
No, but I have heard you
talk about it,

04:11.211 --> 04:13.178
which is why I'm taking you.

04:14.380 --> 04:16.748
Are you asking me
to go to Paris with you?

04:16.781 --> 04:18.016
I believe I just did.

04:18.050 --> 04:19.089
Jeff, do you have any idea

04:19.119 --> 04:20.519
how much is on my plate
right now?

04:20.553 --> 04:21.685
Actually, I do, all of which

04:21.721 --> 04:24.022
Harvey has agreed to cover.

04:24.056 --> 04:25.924
You went to Harvey with this.

04:25.958 --> 04:27.359
Well, I would have
come to you first,

04:27.393 --> 04:30.262
but then it really
wouldn't be a surprise.

04:32.664 --> 04:34.232
I'll think about it.

04:34.266 --> 04:36.334
Take all the time you need.

04:36.368 --> 04:37.701
But in the meantime,

04:37.736 --> 04:40.671
I'll be thinking about
who else around here I can take.

04:40.705 --> 04:42.240
Really?

04:42.274 --> 04:44.408
Well, you're awfully
sure of yourself.

04:44.443 --> 04:47.011
You think I haven't seen
the way Norma looks at me?

04:47.045 --> 04:48.912
Calls me
the Black Stallion.

04:55.253 --> 04:57.054
Norma.

05:00.291 --> 05:01.291
Taking a case.

05:01.325 --> 05:02.693
What kind of case?

05:02.727 --> 05:03.994
What does it matter?

05:04.029 --> 05:05.896
Because you wouldn't be
announcing it like that

05:05.930 --> 05:07.364
if there wasn't something wrong.

05:07.398 --> 05:10.367
It's a case that came
from Professor Gerard.

05:10.401 --> 05:11.468
What?

05:11.502 --> 05:12.736
A man who used to work
at Liberty Rail

05:12.771 --> 05:14.771
says the real cause
of the crash was covered up.

05:14.805 --> 05:16.072
Then refer him to a firm

05:16.106 --> 05:17.840
that takes whistle-blower cases,
because we don't.

05:17.875 --> 05:18.941
Yeah, I'm not gonna do that.

05:18.976 --> 05:20.476
Then don't,
but there's a reason

05:20.510 --> 05:22.812
lawyers who take whistle-blower
cases don't work here,

05:22.846 --> 05:24.313
and it's because corporations

05:24.347 --> 05:26.082
don't appreciate
shakedown artists.

05:26.116 --> 05:27.476
And what if
this isn't a shakedown?

05:27.484 --> 05:28.617
And how do you know
it isn't?

05:28.652 --> 05:30.252
What I know is that
innocent people died--

05:30.287 --> 05:32.789
mothers and fathers
and sons and daughters--

05:32.823 --> 05:35.158
and if somebody's covering up
why that happened

05:35.192 --> 05:36.726
and I can stop it,
then I'm going to.

05:36.760 --> 05:38.127
And I said you're not.

05:38.162 --> 05:40.029
Well, but you also said
that Professor Gerard

05:40.064 --> 05:41.864
didn't know my secret.

05:43.232 --> 05:45.500
Harvey, I know,
I know he'll never tell anyone,

05:45.534 --> 05:47.703
but someday, someone's
gonna find out who will,

05:47.737 --> 05:48.737
and I'll be done.

05:48.738 --> 05:49.771
Mike, he's not--

05:49.806 --> 05:51.506
Harvey, I got
into this whole thing

05:51.540 --> 05:54.810
so that I could try
to help people,

05:54.844 --> 05:56.544
and I don't know
how much time I have left,

05:56.579 --> 06:00.749
so please,

06:00.783 --> 06:03.785
let me try
and help these people.

06:07.556 --> 06:09.124
Then you better make damn sure

06:09.158 --> 06:12.159

isn't full of sh--.

06:50.840 --> 06:52.240
Bonjour, madame.

06:52.275 --> 06:54.543
Oh, I'm so glad you started
with that French bullshit,

06:54.578 --> 06:56.211
because that's what
I want to talk to you about.

06:56.245 --> 06:57.512
I know.

06:57.547 --> 06:59.848
Never thought I'd have
someone ask my permission

06:59.883 --> 07:01.149
to take you to Paris.

07:01.184 --> 07:03.118
You know damn well
that's not what Jeff did.

07:04.921 --> 07:07.122
Jessica, what exactly
do you want to talk about?

07:07.156 --> 07:09.424
I want to know
why you cleared my schedule.

07:09.459 --> 07:11.025
Because Jeff asked me to,

07:11.060 --> 07:12.894
and I can't remember the last
time you took a vacation.

07:12.928 --> 07:14.629
When's the last time
you took a vacation?

07:14.663 --> 07:16.598
I'm not the one
in a serious relationship.

07:16.632 --> 07:18.032
Oh, so you're playing matchmaker
for me now?

07:18.067 --> 07:19.267
Oh, I'm not playing anything,

07:19.302 --> 07:20.835
and you were the one
who said you had to choose

07:20.869 --> 07:23.871
between hiring him
and continuing to see him.

07:23.906 --> 07:25.207
And then I changed my mind.

07:25.241 --> 07:27.109
And I don't want you
to make the same mistake I did.

07:27.143 --> 07:30.645
What are you talking about?

07:30.679 --> 07:32.247
I should have taken
some time with Scottie.

07:32.281 --> 07:34.015
Jeff and I are not
you and Scottie.

07:34.049 --> 07:35.484
Jessica, take a vacation.

07:35.518 --> 07:36.918
Don't take a vacation.

07:36.952 --> 07:38.320
The man came in here,

07:38.354 --> 07:40.654
asking me for help because
he wants to go away with you,

07:40.688 --> 07:43.757
and I said yes because I'm not
gonna be the reason he can't.

07:54.002 --> 07:57.471
Pearson Specter,
how may I direct your call?

08:01.209 --> 08:04.444
Pearson Specter,
how may I direct your call?

08:09.316 --> 08:11.651
- Louis, do you have a minute?
- No, I don't.

08:11.685 --> 08:14.521
Okay.
What are you doing?

08:14.555 --> 08:16.789
Pearson Specter,
how may I direct your call?

08:16.823 --> 08:19.159
Pearson Specter,
how may I direct your call?

08:19.193 --> 08:20.660
You hear--

08:20.694 --> 08:22.228
Pearson Specter,
how may I direct your call?

08:22.263 --> 08:26.331
Hello?
Pearson Specter--

08:26.366 --> 08:27.867
You hear that?

08:27.901 --> 08:29.601
Where's the Litt?

08:29.636 --> 08:31.436
Every call is like a slap
in the face.

08:31.471 --> 08:33.673
Louis, it's standard practice
for a law firm

08:33.707 --> 08:34.940
to shorten their name
on the phone.

08:34.975 --> 08:36.909
So blatant disrespect
is standard practice now?

08:36.943 --> 08:38.443
It's not disrespect.
It's just--

08:38.477 --> 08:40.511
You're telling me
that your father doesn't

08:40.547 --> 08:41.580
have them answer the phone,

08:41.614 --> 08:43.315
"Rand, Kaldore, Zane"?

08:43.349 --> 08:44.684
Actually, no, he doesn't,

08:44.718 --> 08:48.187
and I think you'd agree
that people respect my father.

08:48.221 --> 08:49.453
Unless you want to go back
to telling me

08:49.488 --> 08:50.689
that he's a shady lawyer.

08:50.723 --> 08:52.603
Come on, Rachel,
that was when I was mad at you.

08:52.624 --> 08:56.761
Which is actually why I wanted
to come and talk to you.

08:57.997 --> 09:00.965
I want to thank you
for forgiving Mike.

09:01.000 --> 09:04.502
It--it means a lot to me.

09:04.536 --> 09:06.204
Now, can you stop
obsessing over the phone

09:06.238 --> 09:08.673
long enough to hear that?

09:08.708 --> 09:09.908
I'm sorry, Rachel,

09:09.942 --> 09:11.309
but I can't,

09:11.343 --> 09:13.211
and now I have to go rip
that receptionist a new ass--

09:13.245 --> 09:16.247
Louis, if one of your first acts
as name partner

09:16.281 --> 09:19.049
is to rip the receptionist
to shreds,

09:19.084 --> 09:21.319
you'll regret that
for the rest of your life.

09:21.353 --> 09:23.187
Just let it go.

09:23.222 --> 09:24.488
Let it go.

09:24.523 --> 09:27.758
Things will run
their course.

09:27.792 --> 09:29.760
You know what, Rachel?
You're right.

09:29.794 --> 09:33.797
And by the way, I'm glad
that we're friends again.

09:44.007 --> 09:46.008
Pearson Specter--

09:49.247 --> 09:52.515
Harvey, what are you doing
at 3:30 this afternoon?

09:52.550 --> 09:53.883
Why?

09:53.917 --> 09:56.152
I have some news, and I don't
want you to overreact.

09:56.186 --> 09:57.186
What is it?

09:57.187 --> 10:00.590
Jeffrey Bender
wants to meet with you.

10:00.625 --> 10:02.158
He heard we're taking
a whistle-blower case,

10:02.192 --> 10:05.160
and he wants us to drop it.

10:05.194 --> 10:08.430
Relax, I'll take care
of Jeffrey Bender.

10:08.465 --> 10:09.565
Wait a second,
you're not gonna try

10:09.599 --> 10:11.367
to cut Mike's legs
out from under him

10:11.401 --> 10:12.735
- before he even gets started?
- What's the point?

10:12.769 --> 10:15.237
He'd just bother me
until I agreed not to anyway.

10:18.040 --> 10:19.875
I can't believe it.

10:19.909 --> 10:22.311
You have no idea what to say.

10:22.345 --> 10:24.546
What's the date today?
I want to write this down.

10:24.581 --> 10:26.348
You know what?

10:26.383 --> 10:27.949
It's the seventh
of kiss my ass,

10:27.984 --> 10:31.086
and tomorrow is the eighth of
set your own goddamn meetings.

10:31.120 --> 10:32.420
Is that the Mayan calendar?

10:32.454 --> 10:34.489
Nope,
that's the Donna calendar.

10:34.523 --> 10:37.292
I got you.
For the record, I got you.

10:40.329 --> 10:42.664
All right, take me
through it one more time.

10:42.698 --> 10:44.766
It's simple.

10:44.801 --> 10:48.069
There are axles on all the cars
in all the trains,

10:48.104 --> 10:51.072
and those axles have sensors to
make sure they don't overheat.

10:51.107 --> 10:52.540
So you're saying
that the train crashed

10:52.574 --> 10:53.875
because the heat sensors
failed.

10:53.910 --> 10:56.311
I'm saying
that all the heat sensors

10:56.345 --> 10:58.846
on the entire fleet were faulty,

10:58.880 --> 11:00.247
and they knew about it.

11:00.282 --> 11:01.849
Then why didn't you
come forward with this before?

11:01.883 --> 11:04.218
You mean before they fired me
for coming forward with it?

11:04.252 --> 11:05.753
Which brings me
to my next question.

11:05.788 --> 11:08.255
You've had four different jobs
in the last six years.

11:08.290 --> 11:09.290
What are you getting at?

11:09.291 --> 11:11.459
I want to know why.

11:11.493 --> 11:12.660
I move around.

11:12.695 --> 11:14.028
It's not uncommon
in my business.

11:14.062 --> 11:16.531
Move around or keep failing?

11:16.565 --> 11:18.833
I got fired
for blowing the whistle,

11:18.867 --> 11:20.301
not for messing up on the job.

11:20.336 --> 11:22.296
That's not what your last
performance review says.

11:22.304 --> 11:24.103
I don't give a shit
what it says.

11:24.138 --> 11:26.206
They used that as an excuse
to fire me,

11:26.240 --> 11:28.775
and my reviews
before I came forward

11:28.810 --> 11:30.477
passed with flying colors.

11:30.511 --> 11:31.578
I'm a solid worker.

11:31.612 --> 11:32.946
How the hell do you think
I got this?

11:32.980 --> 11:34.748
I know your reviews
are stellar.

11:34.782 --> 11:36.750
What I need to know is
if there's anything out there

11:36.784 --> 11:38.918
that we don't have, because
they are gonna come at us

11:38.953 --> 11:41.287
any way they can,
and when they do,

11:41.322 --> 11:42.823
it's not gonna
be about heat sensors.

11:42.857 --> 11:44.358
It's gonna be about you.

11:44.392 --> 11:47.327
Yeah, I don't care if
I'm the worst guy in the world.

11:47.362 --> 11:49.796
I know I'm not the only guy
in that company

11:49.831 --> 11:51.965
that knows
those sensors are faulty.

11:54.068 --> 11:55.969
What are you talking about?

11:56.003 --> 11:57.737
What do you mean,
there's a report?

11:57.771 --> 12:00.907
Done after the crash
that showed a defective part

12:00.941 --> 12:03.343
was the real cause,
not engineer error.

12:03.377 --> 12:04.510
Says the whistle-blower.

12:04.544 --> 12:07.413
Says these.

12:07.447 --> 12:09.015
That's a memo
ordering the report

12:09.049 --> 12:11.817
and another email
acknowledging its existence.

12:11.852 --> 12:13.152
We got 'em.

12:13.187 --> 12:14.820
- We do.
- Set a meeting.

12:14.855 --> 12:16.890
Let them do the talking,
then drop the hammer,

12:16.924 --> 12:18.224
and stick a settlement
down their throat

12:18.259 --> 12:19.225
before they know
what hit them.

12:19.260 --> 12:20.826
I appreciate the advice,
Harvey,

12:20.861 --> 12:22.827
but this time I'm going in
with the hammer in my hand,

12:22.862 --> 12:24.529
and I am coming out swinging.

12:24.563 --> 12:26.398
Okay, big talker,
how much you asking for?

12:26.432 --> 12:28.166
40 million.

12:28.201 --> 12:29.501
Are you kidding me?

12:29.535 --> 12:31.937
They'll pay ten times that
without even trying.

12:31.971 --> 12:33.305
Not when I tell them
they're gonna have to admit

12:33.339 --> 12:34.606
what they did.

12:34.640 --> 12:36.408
- Are you nuts?
- No, I am not.

12:36.442 --> 12:37.842
We are not sealing
this settlement,

12:37.877 --> 12:40.279
and before you say another word,
this is my case.

12:40.313 --> 12:41.513
I don't care
whose case it is.

12:41.547 --> 12:43.282
They're never going to admit
what they did.

12:43.316 --> 12:44.956
Pick a higher number
and let them seal it.

12:44.984 --> 12:47.219
Harvey, you told me to prove
this wasn't a shakedown.

12:47.253 --> 12:49.554
Now you want me to take money
to cover things up?

12:49.588 --> 12:51.322
You know what that is?
A shakedown!

12:51.356 --> 12:54.025
A shakedown is when
your case has no merit.

12:54.059 --> 12:55.326
This is the way things work.

12:55.360 --> 12:56.827
Not to mention,
if we quietly settle,

12:56.861 --> 12:58.996
we don't have to worry
about scaring away our clients.

12:59.031 --> 13:00.697
That's why
it's the way things work.

13:00.732 --> 13:02.800
Harvey, people died
in this crash!

13:02.834 --> 13:05.436
And they're not coming back, no
matter what Liberty Rail admits.

13:05.470 --> 13:07.405
You are such a cold,
heartless son of a bitch.

13:07.439 --> 13:09.206
And this isn't
about your parents,

13:09.241 --> 13:11.175
so back them
into whatever corner you want,

13:11.209 --> 13:13.110
but when they refuse
to admit what they did,

13:13.145 --> 13:15.879
you are not going to trial.

13:19.584 --> 13:21.585
Stay out of my case.

13:33.252 --> 13:35.286
Something smells delicious.

13:35.320 --> 13:39.556
I'm making us dinner, but it
won't be ready for a while.

13:39.591 --> 13:41.259
Good,
that means we have time

13:41.293 --> 13:43.795
to go over
my proposed itinerary.

13:43.829 --> 13:46.030
I don't recall saying yes.

13:46.064 --> 13:48.266
I thought that we would start

13:48.300 --> 13:51.002
with a private tour
of the Rodin.

13:51.036 --> 13:52.436
Oh, the Rodin.

13:52.470 --> 13:56.072
God, I must have visited that
sculpture garden a dozen times.

13:56.107 --> 13:57.874
Then I'm so glad that I arranged
for us to have a picnic

13:57.909 --> 13:59.309
while we're there,

13:59.343 --> 14:00.376
and during that picnic,

14:00.411 --> 14:03.814
we can reminisce
about the week before,

14:03.848 --> 14:06.683
where we danced the night away
in the Latin Quarter.

14:06.717 --> 14:08.118
We did?

14:08.152 --> 14:10.921
Mm, or we'll talk
about how we'll end the trip

14:10.955 --> 14:13.423
in the Loire Valley,

14:13.457 --> 14:17.593
where we will sip wine
along the Seine.

loved Paris, so I started there.

14:28.572 --> 14:30.606

I called your sister.

You did that for me?

- Mm-hmm.

So you let me go through
all that even though

14:57.267 --> 14:59.301

say yes the entire time?

something too needy,

15:45.179 --> 15:46.846
It was one client,
and you covered it.

15:46.881 --> 15:48.215

to trial,

15:48.249 --> 15:49.316

when they answer the phone.

19:06.008 --> 19:08.009
- Who says I did that?
- They do.

19:08.043 --> 19:09.777
God damn it.

19:09.812 --> 19:11.345
I paid them good money
to keep Louis

19:11.379 --> 19:12.580
from finding out
for at least a month.

19:12.615 --> 19:13.848
He hasn't found out.

19:13.882 --> 19:15.850
It wasn't him who got them
to crack, it was me.

19:15.884 --> 19:17.719
Even still,
I'm asking for a refund.

19:17.753 --> 19:20.354
Jeff, I'm serious
about this.

19:22.224 --> 19:24.892
I know you're pissed about
how he got his name on the door,

19:24.927 --> 19:27.394
but I need you
to bury the hatchet.

19:27.429 --> 19:29.363
- Well, I'm not gonna do that.
- Why not?

19:29.397 --> 19:31.465
Because every single time
I see his rat face,

19:31.500 --> 19:32.866
I think about him
blackmailing you,

19:32.900 --> 19:34.101
and it makes me want
to walk over to him

19:34.135 --> 19:35.468
and rip his arms
off his body,

19:35.503 --> 19:38.872
and that little phone prank
was just my way

19:38.906 --> 19:42.042
of keeping myself
from doing something like that.

19:42.076 --> 19:43.510
I understand,

19:43.544 --> 19:45.712
and I do appreciate it,

19:45.747 --> 19:48.181
but I'm not asking you
to do it for him.

19:48.215 --> 19:50.216
I'm asking you to do it
for me.

19:58.626 --> 20:00.826
Mr. Ross.

20:00.861 --> 20:02.395
All I can say about your filing
is that I think

20:02.429 --> 20:04.597
you might have a career
writing fiction.

20:04.632 --> 20:06.666
And if you don't hand over
that report we're requesting,

20:06.700 --> 20:08.368
you're gonna
have a career behind bars.

20:08.402 --> 20:09.802
You're not here
for that report.

20:09.836 --> 20:12.138
You're here to strong arm
my client into a big, fat check.

20:12.173 --> 20:13.540
I'm sorry to be the one
to tell you this,

20:13.574 --> 20:16.409
but a big, fat check
isn't gonna get you out of this.

20:16.443 --> 20:17.910
- Is that a fact?
- Sure as hell is,

20:17.944 --> 20:19.279
because we both know
that report

20:19.313 --> 20:21.681
says you're responsible
for this accident,

20:21.715 --> 20:23.816
and we're not settling anything
without you admitting it.

20:23.850 --> 20:26.851
And we're not admitting
something we didn't do.

20:28.421 --> 20:29.588
What the hell is this?

20:29.622 --> 20:30.889
Well, you wanted the report.

20:30.923 --> 20:32.524
Here it is.

20:32.559 --> 20:34.393
Your client wasn't lying
about its existence.

20:34.427 --> 20:36.328
He was just lying
about everything else.

20:36.362 --> 20:38.330
We ran repeated tests
on our heat sensors,

20:38.364 --> 20:40.098
and they passed every one.

20:42.134 --> 20:43.134
This is bullshit.

20:43.169 --> 20:44.236
The only thing that's bullshit

20:44.270 --> 20:45.804
is Joe Henderson.

20:45.838 --> 20:47.406
He doesn't care
about the accident.

20:47.440 --> 20:49.107
All he's trying to do
is shake us down,

20:49.141 --> 20:51.810
exactly like he did
at his last four jobs.

20:55.247 --> 20:56.581
What the hell is that?

20:56.615 --> 20:59.117
His last four lawsuits.

20:59.151 --> 21:00.618
Did you think we wouldn't
find out about them

21:00.652 --> 21:02.220
just because the records
were sealed?

21:02.254 --> 21:04.322
Mr. Ross,
your client's been playing

21:04.356 --> 21:06.424
the whistle-blower lottery
for years.

21:06.458 --> 21:07.892
He's never won before.

21:07.927 --> 21:09.794
He's not going to win today.

21:19.972 --> 21:21.840
You son of a bitch,
you tried to blow the whistle

21:21.874 --> 21:25.876
at every job you've ever had,
and now they know it!

21:25.910 --> 21:28.345
Keep your voice down.

21:28.379 --> 21:30.014
You--
no, I'll keep my voice down

21:30.048 --> 21:31.381
when you stop bullshit-ing me.

21:31.415 --> 21:33.717
Those claims were
supposed to be sealed.

21:33.752 --> 21:35.452
I don't care what they were
supposed to be.

21:35.486 --> 21:38.388
They found them, and you were
supposed to tell me about them.

21:38.422 --> 21:40.323
And what would you
have done if I did?

21:40.358 --> 21:41.659
I would've said
what they said,

21:41.693 --> 21:43.533
that you don't give a shit
about what they did!

21:43.561 --> 21:44.928
You're just looking
to get rich.

21:44.963 --> 21:46.729
You think I would've
risked my job

21:46.764 --> 21:49.199
and everything that I have
for nothing?

21:49.233 --> 21:50.233
Excuse me?

21:50.268 --> 21:52.235
I said, I don't see you

21:52.270 --> 21:53.936
working out of the goodness
of your heart

21:53.971 --> 21:56.005
in your $1,000 suit.

21:56.040 --> 21:59.209
You have no idea
who I am or why I do things.

21:59.243 --> 22:02.279
And I told you, you don't have
to be concerned about my history

22:02.313 --> 22:05.282
because what
I'm telling you is true.

22:05.316 --> 22:07.083
Not according to this.

22:07.117 --> 22:09.486
That's the report that you said
gave us all the leverage

22:09.520 --> 22:11.488
and they say
proves them innocent.

22:11.522 --> 22:13.256
That report is bullshit,

22:13.291 --> 22:15.925
because I'm telling you,
those sensors didn't work,

22:15.959 --> 22:17.526
and that was the cause
of that accident.

22:17.561 --> 22:18.828
Well, I might have
a leg to stand on

22:18.862 --> 22:20.963
if you had
any credibility at all.

22:20.998 --> 22:22.832
How the hell am I supposed
to get a jury to believe you

22:22.866 --> 22:24.867
when I'm not even sure I do?

22:33.677 --> 22:35.044
What are you doing here?

22:35.079 --> 22:36.813
I'm here to tell you
to call the front desk.

22:36.847 --> 22:38.781
Oh, let me guess.

22:38.816 --> 22:40.615
Jessica told you
they won't say my name

22:40.649 --> 22:41.983
and you thought
it was hilarious.

22:42.018 --> 22:43.185
You're right, I did.

22:43.219 --> 22:44.252
Why don't you get the hell
out of my office

22:44.286 --> 22:46.354
and go laugh somewhere else?

22:46.388 --> 22:47.856
Oh, you want to hit me now?

22:47.890 --> 22:49.858
Yeah, well, why don't you go
ask Mike Ross about my headlock?

22:49.892 --> 22:52.060
'Cause it's a goddamn vice.

22:57.399 --> 22:58.366
Pearson Specter Litt,

22:58.400 --> 23:00.401
how may I direct your call?

23:05.474 --> 23:06.474
It was you.

23:06.475 --> 23:07.843
Yes, it was me,

23:07.877 --> 23:10.445
but I fixed it,
so...

23:10.479 --> 23:12.380
you can stop worrying
if everybody at the firm

23:12.414 --> 23:15.483
respects you,
because they do.

23:19.488 --> 23:21.489
Everyone except you.

23:28.063 --> 23:29.764
No, Louis, including me.

23:29.798 --> 23:32.333
Listen, I may not like how
you got your name on the wall,

23:32.368 --> 23:34.902
but that doesn't mean
it shouldn't be up there.

23:37.139 --> 23:40.140
Congratulations, Louis.

23:40.174 --> 23:42.976
Thanks, Jeff.

23:43.010 --> 23:45.812
Hey, maybe we can even
get drinks this week.

23:47.114 --> 23:50.384
- Name partner buys.
- Deal.

23:50.418 --> 23:52.018
Done.

23:57.458 --> 23:59.378
You can leave the coffee,
but I'm not getting up.

23:59.394 --> 24:01.728
Mike, you've been working
for seven hours straight.

24:01.763 --> 24:03.229
You need a break.

24:03.264 --> 24:04.864
I've been working for seven
hours because if I tell Harvey

24:04.899 --> 24:06.333
what's going on
before I have a fix,

24:06.367 --> 24:07.601
he is gonna pull the plug.

24:07.635 --> 24:09.335
Well, then maybe the plug
needs to be pulled.

24:09.369 --> 24:11.070
Rachel, just because
Joe Henderson is

24:11.105 --> 24:12.172
a bullshit plaintiff
doesn't mean

24:12.206 --> 24:13.372
they didn't cover things up.

24:13.407 --> 24:16.142
It doesn't mean
that they did.

24:16.177 --> 24:17.677
Okay, fine.

24:17.711 --> 24:18.812
Why would he ask
for that report

24:18.846 --> 24:21.514
if he knew
it would hurt our case?

24:21.548 --> 24:22.882
- I don't know.
- I don't know either,

24:22.917 --> 24:24.517
which is why I need more time.

24:24.551 --> 24:26.619
Well, then you need to convince
Harvey to let you keep going,

24:26.653 --> 24:28.221
because if you don't
and he finds out--

24:28.255 --> 24:29.689
He is not gonna find out.

24:29.723 --> 24:32.625
Mike, he's not gonna
find out from me,

24:32.659 --> 24:34.894
but if I've learned one thing
in the last six months

24:34.929 --> 24:39.031
of working here, it's that if
he finds out from somebody else,

24:39.065 --> 24:41.533
you're gonna regret it.

24:47.273 --> 24:48.907
You come here to tell me
you're taking that vacation?

24:48.942 --> 24:50.775
I came by to ask
when Mike Ross started taking

24:50.810 --> 24:51.810
whistle-blower cases.

24:51.811 --> 24:52.811
Jessica--

24:52.812 --> 24:54.112
I want you
to put the brakes on him

24:54.147 --> 24:55.314
before this gets
out of control.

24:55.348 --> 24:57.282
Well, I'm not gonna do that.

24:57.317 --> 24:58.984
- Harvey.
- Jessica, it's one case.

24:59.018 --> 25:01.519
He asked me to trust him,
and I'm gonna do it,

25:01.554 --> 25:03.755
and if you're ever gonna
be able to enjoy a vacation,

25:03.789 --> 25:06.924
you're gonna have to trust me.

25:06.959 --> 25:10.261
All right.
Good night.

25:10.295 --> 25:12.629
Bon voyage.

25:12.664 --> 25:14.732
You do know
that doesn't mean "good night."

25:14.766 --> 25:15.967
Of course I do.

25:16.001 --> 25:17.969
Do you know how to say
"good night" in French?

25:18.003 --> 25:20.571
What, do you think
I'm some kind of Neanderthal?

25:20.605 --> 25:23.941
You don't know one word
of French, do you?

25:23.976 --> 25:25.109
<i>Ménage à trois.</i>

25:25.143 --> 25:26.978
You're an idiot.

25:28.313 --> 25:30.514
<i>Ménage à quatre.</i>

25:30.548 --> 25:32.350
<i>Ménage à cinq.</i>

25:34.051 --> 25:36.019
Can I come in?

25:40.625 --> 25:43.226
What's going on?

25:43.261 --> 25:44.261
We have a problem.

25:44.262 --> 25:46.296
I'm listening.

25:46.330 --> 25:49.232
Liberty Rail's report
directly contradicts our claim.

25:49.267 --> 25:50.667
That's a big damn problem.

25:50.702 --> 25:52.235
I believe my client, Harvey.

25:52.270 --> 25:53.437
Based on what, your gut?

25:53.471 --> 25:55.238
No, I found the guy
who wrote the report.

25:55.273 --> 25:57.641
He's on indefinite leave
in Australia,

25:57.675 --> 25:59.242
where we can't subpoena him.

25:59.277 --> 26:01.144
So it's our word
against theirs.

26:01.178 --> 26:02.845
Which is why I'm here.

26:04.848 --> 26:08.451
Joe Henderson made four other
claims in the last six years.

26:08.485 --> 26:09.725
- You're shit-ing me.
- Harvey--

26:09.753 --> 26:11.922
That's it.
I'm pulling the plug.

26:11.956 --> 26:13.223
I knew it.

26:13.257 --> 26:14.958
I knew you would bail on me
the second this thing

26:14.992 --> 26:16.059
hit the smallest bump.

26:16.093 --> 26:17.260
Bail on you?

26:17.295 --> 26:19.262
I backed you because you told me
you had a case.

26:19.297 --> 26:21.965
I do have a case.
I told you they got to this guy.

26:21.999 --> 26:23.033
And you got no proof of that.

26:23.067 --> 26:24.100
And if this were your case,

26:24.135 --> 26:26.069
you would be begging me
for help to get it.

26:26.103 --> 26:27.603
It's not my case.
It's yours.

26:27.638 --> 26:29.171
And now you're asking a jury

26:29.205 --> 26:31.574
to believe these guys
fabricated a report

26:31.608 --> 26:33.743
based on the word
of a career whistle-blower.

26:33.777 --> 26:35.511
No, I'm asking you
to believe it.

26:35.546 --> 26:37.012
It doesn't matter
what I believe.

26:37.047 --> 26:38.948
This guy is
a goddamn shakedown artist,

26:38.982 --> 26:39.982
and I'm pulling the plug.

26:39.983 --> 26:41.216
I don't care what he is.

26:41.251 --> 26:44.320
I'm not
a goddamn shakedown artist!

26:44.354 --> 26:45.721
Mike--

26:45.756 --> 26:50.726
Harvey, you told me that
those people weren't my parents,

26:50.761 --> 26:52.895
but they are
somebody's parents.

26:55.566 --> 26:57.399
Please.

26:58.936 --> 27:00.937
You got 24 hours.

27:18.582 --> 27:20.850
You know it's against the law
to litter, don't you?

27:20.884 --> 27:22.284
What do you want, Donna?

27:22.318 --> 27:23.518
I know you went to see Harvey.

27:23.520 --> 27:24.953
You know that
he wants me to fail.

27:24.988 --> 27:26.288
That's not true.

27:26.322 --> 27:28.290
I don't have anything,
and he only gave me a day.

27:28.324 --> 27:29.392
And if he wanted you to fail,

27:29.426 --> 27:32.227
he wouldn't have given you
another second.

27:32.262 --> 27:34.697
You know he thinks
this is about my parents, right?

27:38.001 --> 27:39.834
Is it?

27:43.706 --> 27:46.408
Maybe it is,

27:46.442 --> 27:48.743
but what these people did
is a million times worse

27:48.778 --> 27:51.012
because they knew
it could happen.

27:51.046 --> 27:52.514
Wait a second--
they knew this could happen,

27:52.548 --> 27:53.848
and they didn't fix it before?

27:53.883 --> 27:55.917
Yeah, Donna, and then they--
they rolled the dice.

27:55.951 --> 27:57.018
Well, what about now?

27:57.052 --> 27:58.152
Are those trains
still messed up?

27:58.186 --> 27:59.587
Because that would
make them monsters.

27:59.622 --> 28:01.456
They are monsters, but that
would also make them idiots,

28:01.490 --> 28:02.557
and they're not idiots.

28:02.591 --> 28:03.725
Well, what are you
talking about?

28:03.759 --> 28:05.258
Well, they must have
fixed the sensors by now;

28:05.293 --> 28:07.093
otherwise if it happened again,
they'd all go to jail.

28:07.128 --> 28:08.695
Well, if they fixed the sensors,
then there has to be

28:08.730 --> 28:09.897
- a paper trail.
- Of course there is.

28:09.931 --> 28:11.432
Then all you have to do
is get it.

28:11.466 --> 28:13.467
What do you think I've been
trying to figure out all night?

28:13.501 --> 28:15.268
What's to figure out?
Subpoena it.

28:15.303 --> 28:18.505
Yeah, there's only one problem.
Harvey only gave me 24 hours.

28:18.540 --> 28:19.640
But now that
you've come up with this,

28:19.674 --> 28:21.207
maybe Harvey
will change his mind.

28:21.242 --> 28:23.477
Donna, I have a theory that
I can't prove and an opposition

28:23.511 --> 28:25.178
that's shown they're willing
to alter evidence.

28:25.212 --> 28:27.914
He's not gonna change his mind,
and you know it.

28:27.949 --> 28:29.515
There's got to be another way.

28:29.550 --> 28:32.685
Donna, look, I appreciate
what you're doing,

28:32.719 --> 28:35.555
but unless you have this other
way in your pocket, please,

28:35.589 --> 28:38.425
just leave me alone
and let me try

28:38.459 --> 28:41.094
and think this thing through.

28:59.812 --> 29:01.780
No! I don't care what he says.

29:01.814 --> 29:03.282
It's an active
goddamn investigation,

29:03.316 --> 29:04.283
and I'm not gonna
stand around--

29:04.317 --> 29:05.317
You can't talk
on that here.

29:05.352 --> 29:06.618
Hang on a second, Charlie.

29:06.652 --> 29:08.720
I'm sorry, we got off
on the wrong foot.

29:08.754 --> 29:10.422
Is your name Danielle?

29:10.457 --> 29:12.157
That's what it says
on the plate, isn't it?

29:12.192 --> 29:14.159
Well, Danielle, I'm here
to pick up the documents

29:14.194 --> 29:16.354
I ordered an hour ago,
and if you don't give them to me

29:16.363 --> 29:17.529
in the next 15 seconds,

29:17.563 --> 29:19.030
today's gonna be
your last day.

29:19.064 --> 29:20.098
You didn't talk to me.

29:20.132 --> 29:22.801
I said hold on, damn it.

29:22.835 --> 29:26.104
Look, I don't have time
to play "who spoke To who."

29:26.138 --> 29:28.373
I am up from DC because,
as it is, these documents

29:28.407 --> 29:30.041
weren't sent
when they were promised.

29:30.075 --> 29:31.342
I'm sorry.
What is it you need again?

29:31.377 --> 29:33.545
Oh, Jesus Christ.

29:33.579 --> 29:36.381
All the maintenance work orders
from the past six months.

29:36.415 --> 29:38.583
I can't let you have that
without authorization.

29:38.618 --> 29:40.785
Well, then by all means,
let's call your supervisor,

29:40.820 --> 29:43.521
and we can tell him
how you'd rather play <i>Farmville</i>

29:43.555 --> 29:45.355
than cooperate with me.

29:49.127 --> 29:50.694
Who did you say
you're with again?

29:50.729 --> 29:53.731
Have you heard of the National
Transportation Safety Board?

29:57.335 --> 29:59.336
They'll give you
what you need in the back.

30:16.587 --> 30:18.220
What did you do?

30:18.255 --> 30:20.156
I didn't do anything.
What did you do?

30:20.190 --> 30:21.190
Don't give me that.

30:21.191 --> 30:22.926
This makes my entire case,

30:22.960 --> 30:25.094
but I can't use it if
I don't know where it came from.

30:25.128 --> 30:27.163
Oh, that looks like
it came from Liberty Rail.

30:27.197 --> 30:29.699
Oh, oh, yeah,
it just happened to walk itself

30:29.733 --> 30:31.768
over from their secure facility.

30:31.802 --> 30:33.736
Well, it's possible that
somebody went over there

30:33.771 --> 30:35.704
and released it
from their secure facility.

30:35.738 --> 30:38.240
Donna, if I go to Harvey
with this and tell him

30:38.275 --> 30:39.475
what I know happened, he--

30:39.509 --> 30:41.009
You don't know.
You think.

30:41.044 --> 30:43.946
Don't lawyer me.
He'll never let me use it.

30:43.980 --> 30:46.182
Well, then don't tell him
what you think happened,

30:46.216 --> 30:49.351
because if you do,
he'll make you drop the case.

30:49.386 --> 30:52.254
Okay, right now,
I don't care about the case.

30:53.623 --> 30:55.491
I care about you.

30:55.525 --> 30:59.095
Mike, I didn't steal anything.

30:59.129 --> 31:00.996
I talked my way in,
and that's what happened.

31:01.030 --> 31:02.064
Did you tell them
this was discovery

31:02.099 --> 31:03.099
for a case against them?

31:03.100 --> 31:04.066
No.

31:04.100 --> 31:05.366
Then it's not admissible
in court.

31:05.401 --> 31:06.835
Well, then you
have to figure out a way

31:06.869 --> 31:10.138
to use it not in court,

31:10.172 --> 31:11.673
but don't ask me
for my help on that.

31:11.708 --> 31:13.709
I have done enough.

31:24.921 --> 31:26.454
Hey.

31:26.489 --> 31:28.523
Heard you
wanted to see me.

31:28.557 --> 31:30.992
I take it you patched things up
with Louis Litt.

31:31.026 --> 31:32.160
How do you know?

31:32.194 --> 31:34.462
Oh, he wanted to know
if you were a sports bar guy

31:34.497 --> 31:35.930
or a wine bar guy.

31:35.964 --> 31:37.965
Did you tell him I'm more
of a strip club kind of guy?

31:38.000 --> 31:40.268
You really want to go
to a strip club with Louis Litt?

31:40.302 --> 31:43.471
I don't really want to go
to a strip club with anyone,

31:43.506 --> 31:44.805
but I do have a meeting
in 10 minutes,

31:44.840 --> 31:45.840
and it's 15 minutes away.

31:45.841 --> 31:47.041
Oh, I just wanted to tell you

31:47.075 --> 31:49.477
that I appreciate you
patching things up with him.

31:49.512 --> 31:51.346
There's no need to thank me.

31:51.380 --> 31:54.382
I would do anything
for the woman that I love...

31:56.452 --> 31:58.453
Even get a drink
with Louis Litt.

32:09.997 --> 32:12.065
You here to talk
about Anderton Software?

32:12.099 --> 32:14.501
Because your 24-hour
Liberty Rail pass is up.

32:14.536 --> 32:15.602
Then I guess
it's a good thing

32:15.637 --> 32:17.638
that just came
in the mail for me.

32:17.672 --> 32:18.672
What is it?

32:18.673 --> 32:19.839
Maintenance records showing

32:19.874 --> 32:21.708
they replaced the heat sensors
on all of their trains

32:21.742 --> 32:24.178
within six weeks
after the derailment.

32:24.212 --> 32:26.480
Now, why would they do that if
they never failed a safety test?

32:26.514 --> 32:27.747
They wouldn't.

32:27.782 --> 32:29.516
Which means Joe Henderson
was telling the truth.

32:29.551 --> 32:30.816
I can think
of three different ways

32:30.850 --> 32:32.218
they'll explain this away.

32:32.252 --> 32:36.289
Not if we can get them on record
before they know we have it.

32:36.323 --> 32:38.224
And why don't they know
we have it?

32:38.258 --> 32:39.625
The same way I didn't know
they got

32:39.660 --> 32:40.900
Joe Henderson's sealed records.

32:40.927 --> 32:42.407
Which means you did
something sketchy.

32:42.429 --> 32:45.030
Harvey, do you want to spend
all night asking me exactly

32:45.065 --> 32:46.232
what I did or did not do,

32:46.266 --> 32:48.634
or do you want
to help me right a wrong?

32:50.970 --> 32:54.307
Donna?

32:54.341 --> 32:56.209
Set a deposition
with Liberty Rail,

32:56.243 --> 32:59.312
and tell them this time
it won't just be Mike.

32:59.346 --> 33:01.146
I'm on it.

33:10.108 --> 33:12.676
Who the hell is that?

33:12.711 --> 33:14.244
That's the CEO
of Liberty Rail.

33:14.278 --> 33:16.379
Yeah, I know who he is.
Who is she?

33:16.414 --> 33:18.048
That's their lawyer.

33:18.083 --> 33:19.849
Why didn't you tell me
she was hot?

33:19.883 --> 33:21.284
Because it's not relevant.

33:21.319 --> 33:22.819
- It is to me.
- Why?

33:22.853 --> 33:24.554
Because she's hot.

33:24.589 --> 33:26.656
You must be
the infamous Harvey Specter.

33:26.691 --> 33:28.791
- You must be--
- Evan Smith.

33:28.826 --> 33:30.460
Have to admit,
when I saw your name was Evan,

33:30.494 --> 33:32.295
I thought you were a man.

33:32.330 --> 33:33.863
And I have to admit,
when I saw your name was Harvey,

33:33.897 --> 33:35.198
I thought you were a man.

33:35.233 --> 33:37.200
- I think I'm in love.
- I think you are too.

33:37.235 --> 33:38.801
Okay, can we
get this over with?

33:38.836 --> 33:40.337
We sure can.

33:40.371 --> 33:42.204
I don't even know how you
have any questions at all,

33:42.239 --> 33:43.305
given our last meeting.

33:43.340 --> 33:44.773
We just have a few.

33:49.178 --> 33:50.979
Mr. McIntyre,
before the derailment,

33:51.013 --> 33:54.015
Liberty Rail conducted tests on
the heat sensors on its trains.

33:54.050 --> 33:55.217
Is that correct?

33:55.252 --> 33:56.772
- Of course we did.
- And why was that?

33:56.786 --> 34:00.055
We run tests
on all our systems.

34:00.089 --> 34:01.390
It's routine.

34:01.424 --> 34:02.758
And the finding of that report

34:02.792 --> 34:04.926
is that there were no problems
with the heat sensors.

34:04.961 --> 34:06.362
Are you going to just
ask questions

34:06.396 --> 34:07.495
that you already
know the answers to?

34:07.529 --> 34:08.996
It's routine.

34:09.030 --> 34:10.665
There weren't any problems
with the sensors.

34:10.699 --> 34:13.635
And do you routinely
replace the heat sensors?

34:13.668 --> 34:15.002
Yes.

34:15.036 --> 34:16.471
We replace them
every five years

34:16.505 --> 34:18.406
as part of our regularly
scheduled maintenance.

34:18.440 --> 34:20.408
And when was the last
regularly scheduled maintenance?

34:20.442 --> 34:21.976
That would be
two years ago.

34:22.010 --> 34:23.143
And you wouldn't fix something
that wasn't broken, right?

34:25.380 --> 34:27.547
Of course not.

34:27.583 --> 34:29.717
I'm not in the business
of wasting money, gentlemen.

34:29.752 --> 34:32.018
I'm a bit confused.

34:32.053 --> 34:34.188
If you're not in the business
of wasting money

34:34.222 --> 34:35.956
and there was nothing wrong
with those sensors,

34:35.991 --> 34:37.958
then why did you just
replace all of them?

34:37.993 --> 34:39.559
They didn't replace
all of them.

34:39.594 --> 34:42.029
I think we'd like your client
to answer that question.

34:44.199 --> 34:45.900
You're in a bit
of a pickle, Richard.

34:45.934 --> 34:47.768
You don't know whether to say
you did or you didn't.

34:47.803 --> 34:49.603
Of course, you could roll
the dice with your own life

34:49.637 --> 34:51.038
just like you did
with other people's.

34:51.072 --> 34:52.907
The truth is,
it doesn't matter,

34:52.940 --> 34:54.408
because you already
said on camera

34:54.442 --> 34:55.609
you didn't replace
those sensors.

34:55.643 --> 34:57.644
And we have these.

35:08.088 --> 35:09.255
Where'd you get these?

35:09.290 --> 35:10.990
I'll tell you
what I told Joe Henderson.

35:11.025 --> 35:13.360
It doesn't matter
where they came from.

35:13.394 --> 35:16.296
It just matters
that they're here.

35:16.331 --> 35:17.831
I need to talk to my client.

35:17.865 --> 35:19.299
That's a good idea.

35:19.334 --> 35:20.634
You should discuss
how many zeros

35:20.668 --> 35:22.035
you're gonna write
on that check.

35:22.069 --> 35:23.169
And one more thing.

35:23.204 --> 35:24.370
You're not only gonna
write a check.

35:24.404 --> 35:25.538
You're gonna
write a public admission

35:25.572 --> 35:27.940
because people died
in that crash.

35:27.974 --> 35:29.408
That's not how this works.

35:29.443 --> 35:35.247
It's how it works today.

35:35.281 --> 35:37.015
You're really gonna force
them to make a public admission?

35:37.050 --> 35:38.417
Damn right, I am.

35:38.452 --> 35:40.720
- Who are you, Mahatma Gandhi?
- Somebody has to be.

35:40.754 --> 35:42.688
You were too busy
demanding a bunch of zeros.

35:42.723 --> 35:44.189
Well, I was just
looking out for you.

35:44.224 --> 35:45.824
Those suits don't pay
for themselves.

35:45.858 --> 35:46.924
No, they don't.

35:46.959 --> 35:50.362
Mike, great job.
You really stepped it up.

35:50.396 --> 35:52.129
Thanks, Harvey.

35:52.164 --> 35:55.166
I think you might be starting
to come into your own too.

36:02.941 --> 36:04.475
Really?

36:04.509 --> 36:06.109
Every single game?

36:06.143 --> 36:08.512
No, just the playoffs.

36:08.546 --> 36:10.213
- Two sips?
- Two sips.

36:10.248 --> 36:12.716
- No more, no less.
- Any beer?

36:12.751 --> 36:14.385
Oh, no, not any beer.

36:14.419 --> 36:15.986
Miller Lite.

36:17.555 --> 36:19.523
Miller Lite?
What?

36:19.557 --> 36:20.591
But she's a queen.

36:20.625 --> 36:22.693
What can I tell you?
She got it from her dad.

36:22.727 --> 36:24.628
Look, if the Giants
are in the playoffs

36:24.662 --> 36:26.430
and Jessica doesn't take
two sips of Miller Lite

36:26.464 --> 36:27.564
after every single first down,

36:27.599 --> 36:28.699
she thinks they're gonna lose,

36:28.733 --> 36:30.000
and there's no talking her
out of it.

36:30.034 --> 36:32.802
And those happen a lot, right?
First downs?

36:32.836 --> 36:34.003
They sure do.

36:34.037 --> 36:36.572
So what is she like
when she's drunk?

36:36.607 --> 36:38.608
Well, that's a conversation
for another time.

36:38.642 --> 36:40.643
Ooh.

36:40.677 --> 36:42.011
I so feel you, bro.

36:46.950 --> 36:49.385
You know, I got to say,
Louis,

36:49.420 --> 36:52.321
I almost feel bad
about pulling that prank on you.

36:52.355 --> 36:55.224
Don't feel bad.

36:55.258 --> 36:56.959
It was a pretty good prank.

36:56.993 --> 37:01.262
Okay.
One more?

37:01.297 --> 37:03.832
Only if you tell me more about
what Jessica's like at home.

37:03.866 --> 37:05.266
No, screw that,
I want you to tell me

37:05.301 --> 37:08.336
what she was like back
when it was Pearson Hardman.

37:08.370 --> 37:10.972
Done.

37:11.006 --> 37:12.073
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:12.107 --> 37:13.207
You're heading out
for the night?

37:13.242 --> 37:14.776
- In a few minutes.
- Want to grab a drink?

37:14.811 --> 37:15.911
Celebrate?

37:15.945 --> 37:17.412
- I can't.
- Why not?

37:17.447 --> 37:19.013
Not that it's
any of your concern,

37:19.048 --> 37:21.114
but I'm having drinks
with Evan Smith.

37:21.149 --> 37:22.983
What?
You got her number?

37:23.017 --> 37:24.384
No, she called me.

37:24.419 --> 37:25.686
Oh, she asked for your number?

37:25.720 --> 37:28.221
No, she didn't have to.
You gave it to her.

37:28.256 --> 37:29.457
It was on that subpoena.

37:29.491 --> 37:31.291
I know what's gonna
be on your subpoena.

37:31.326 --> 37:33.594
- What does that even mean?
- You know what it means.

37:33.628 --> 37:35.429
Sure as hell do.

37:36.865 --> 37:38.666
- You wanted to see me?
- I did.

37:38.700 --> 37:40.733
I take it you heard
about Liberty Rail.

37:40.768 --> 37:41.935
- I did.
- See?

37:41.969 --> 37:45.304
No harm, no foul,
no mass exodus of clients.

37:45.339 --> 37:47.139
I'm glad.

37:47.174 --> 37:48.508
What's on your mind, Jessica?
You don't seem--

37:48.542 --> 37:51.110
I know you told Scottie
about Mike Ross.

37:59.119 --> 38:00.152
How'd you know?

38:00.187 --> 38:02.755
I didn't till just now.

38:02.790 --> 38:04.591
- Jessica--
- I'm not mad.

38:04.625 --> 38:07.259
I just want to know
what made you want to tell her.

38:07.294 --> 38:08.728
What difference
does that make?

38:08.762 --> 38:10.997
Because I want to tell Jeff
the truth about Mike Ross too.

38:11.031 --> 38:12.664
What changed between now

38:12.700 --> 38:14.767
and when you fed him
that Louis bullshit?

38:14.801 --> 38:16.568
Nothing's changed.

38:16.603 --> 38:19.905
I just don't want
to lie to him anymore.

38:19.939 --> 38:22.074
He told you he loved you,
didn't he?

38:23.577 --> 38:26.213
When the hell did you start
figuring shit like that out?

38:27.514 --> 38:30.016
I didn't
till just now.

38:30.050 --> 38:31.250
Then answer my question.

38:31.284 --> 38:33.185
What made you decide
to tell Scottie?

38:33.220 --> 38:36.322
That's not what
you really want to know.

38:36.356 --> 38:40.092
What you want to know
is if I wish I told her sooner.

38:40.127 --> 38:41.927
Do you?

38:44.164 --> 38:45.998
Yes, I do.

38:57.176 --> 38:58.576
Hey.

38:58.610 --> 39:01.812
Hey, Rachel,
what can I do for you?

39:01.847 --> 39:05.616
I just wanted to come by
and say thank you.

39:05.651 --> 39:08.386
- For what?
- Oh, come on, Donna.

39:08.421 --> 39:11.456
Mike told me
you saved the day.

39:11.490 --> 39:12.957
Oh, well, you know,

39:12.991 --> 39:14.825
after I saved those kids
from that burning building,

39:14.860 --> 39:16.661
I had a little extra time, so--

39:16.695 --> 39:18.530
Well, then maybe you should
take the rest of the night off.

39:18.564 --> 39:19.763
And why is that?

39:19.797 --> 39:23.600
Because that's what
superheroes do.

39:48.425 --> 39:50.693
Macallan 18.

39:50.727 --> 39:52.861
You got great taste.

39:52.896 --> 39:54.263
Surprised I called?

39:54.298 --> 39:56.765
Like I said, you got great
taste, but let me be clear.

39:56.800 --> 39:57.967
You want to talk settlement,

39:58.001 --> 40:00.035
I can't do it
without Mike Ross.

40:00.070 --> 40:02.171
I'm definitely not here
to talk settlement.

40:02.206 --> 40:06.142
Good, because there are things
I can do without him,

40:06.176 --> 40:07.977
exceptionally.

40:09.946 --> 40:12.548
I want to show you
a little video.

40:12.583 --> 40:14.750
What, did you dig up footage

40:14.784 --> 40:16.018
from my high school
championship?

40:16.052 --> 40:18.053
Because that'll make this
too easy.

40:19.155 --> 40:21.957
Afraid not.

40:21.992 --> 40:25.360
That's your secretary
unlawfully gathering evidence,

40:25.394 --> 40:29.397
which means there will be
no settlement of any kind.

40:36.039 --> 40:40.109
And tomorrow, I'm sending this
to the district attorney.

40:40.143 --> 40:42.209
Enjoy your drink, handsome.

♪

41:09.904 --> 41:11.104
Jessica.

41:11.139 --> 41:13.874
Jeff, there's something
I need to tell you.

41:13.908 --> 41:15.942
There's something
I need to tell you too.

41:18.647 --> 41:19.980
What's going on?

41:20.014 --> 41:22.216
What's going on is
I just had drinks with Louis,

41:22.250 --> 41:24.017
you know, as a favor to you.

41:24.052 --> 41:27.655
Turns out he's not so great
at holding his liquor.

41:27.689 --> 41:30.524
- What did he do?
- No, he didn't do anything.

41:30.559 --> 41:32.859
- You did.
- I don't--

41:32.894 --> 41:34.094
You see, we were
actually bonding

41:34.128 --> 41:35.928
when I suddenly remembered
what he had done to you,

41:35.962 --> 41:38.264
and I--
well, I wanted to make sure

41:38.299 --> 41:40.433
that no one
ever did that to you again.

41:40.467 --> 41:41.901
So I asked him
how he found out

41:41.935 --> 41:43.703
about Daniel Hardman's
embezzlement,

41:43.737 --> 41:45.238
and he started with the words,

41:45.272 --> 41:47.574
"It was two years ago."

41:47.608 --> 41:48.941
Jeff, I can explain.

41:48.975 --> 41:50.210
You can always explain,

41:50.244 --> 41:52.412
but that just means
your whole story

41:52.447 --> 41:55.416
about how Louis got his name
on the door is bullshit.

41:55.449 --> 41:57.049
And I came here
to tell you the truth.

41:57.085 --> 41:58.652
More bullshit!

41:58.686 --> 42:00.152
Then let me tell you now.

42:00.187 --> 42:01.487
Don't you get it?
We're past that now.

42:01.522 --> 42:03.055
- I don't want to know!
- Jeff--

42:03.090 --> 42:05.090
In fact, I never really
wanted to know, I just--

42:05.124 --> 42:07.125
I just wanted you
to tell me.

42:07.159 --> 42:08.960
But now, no matter
what you tell me,

42:08.994 --> 42:11.463
I won't ever believe
it's the truth.

42:11.497 --> 42:12.797
Jeff, let me in.

42:12.832 --> 42:13.998
It's over, Jessica.

42:14.033 --> 42:16.034
It's done.
