(THEME SONG PLAYING)

00:33.033 --> 00:34.300
(PHONE RINGING)

00:40.801 --> 00:43.534
Yep. Um, Obviously what we're doing in the moment is just...

00:43.601 --> 00:45.734
No!

00:45.801 --> 00:49.334
Sorting the ladies that the agency have sent me into yes and no piles.

00:49.400 --> 00:51.567
These are the matches, they've come up with.

00:51.634 --> 00:53.567
Um, quite a lot of choice, which is good.

00:53.634 --> 00:58.901
Um, and I get three free introductions for the money I've already paid.

00:58.968 --> 01:00.634
Um, I've already chosen one.

01:00.701 --> 01:02.534
Actually, I'm taking her to lunch a little bit later today.

01:02.601 --> 01:04.400
So, just got to choose two more.

01:04.467 --> 01:06.734
And I just hook up with them, see how it goes.

01:06.801 --> 01:07.868
What's the worst that could happen?

01:07.934 --> 01:09.033
You could get one pregnant.

01:09.100 --> 01:10.868
I'm not gonna get one pregnant, am I?

01:10.934 --> 01:13.701
-Do you mind black ones? -No. All equal.

01:13.767 --> 01:15.701
'Cause they've sent you three of them.

01:15.767 --> 01:18.100
That is a lot, innit.

01:18.167 --> 01:21.667
Uh, shall put them all on the Yes pile or just one to show you're not prejudiced?

01:21.734 --> 01:22.634
Well, which one then?

01:23.834 --> 01:25.234
That one's smiling.

01:25.300 --> 01:26.234
Friendliest.

01:29.434 --> 01:31.667
Look at that, 41.

01:31.734 --> 01:33.467
Looks 30. Look at those!

01:33.534 --> 01:35.734
-Yes pile? -Yeah, if she's got a good personality.

01:35.801 --> 01:37.968
Mind you though, it says it's a recent photo,

01:38.033 --> 01:40.601
how can you be sure though? That could've been taken when she was 30.

01:40.667 --> 01:43.801
I think they should have to have their picture taken with a copy of today's newspaper.

01:43.868 --> 01:44.901
-(KNOCK AT DOOR) -So...

01:44.968 --> 01:46.601
-NEIL: All right? -Hiya.

01:46.667 --> 01:48.000
-Everything okay? -DAVID: Yep.

01:48.067 --> 01:50.267
-Busy? -DAVID: Yep.

01:50.334 --> 01:51.434
Uh, Gareth, I'll be back at three.

01:51.500 --> 01:53.267
I need to have a chat with you, okay?

01:53.334 --> 01:54.534
GARETH: Okay.

01:54.601 --> 01:56.434
Uh, see you at the Christmas party, David.

01:56.500 --> 01:58.701
-DAVID: See you then. -You still need the two tickets, do you?

01:58.767 --> 02:01.000
You still bringing a lady friend to the party?

02:01.067 --> 02:03.167
-Yep. -NEIL: Good.

02:03.234 --> 02:04.534
Look forward to meeting her.

02:11.634 --> 02:13.000
No. Come on, we better...

02:14.534 --> 02:15.300
No.

02:25.734 --> 02:27.100
(WHISTLES FEEBLY)

02:27.167 --> 02:29.434
Everybody, if I can have your attention, please.

02:29.500 --> 02:30.834
Short announcement.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.467
Okay.

02:34.534 --> 02:36.500
Uh, for those of you who care or liked her,

02:36.567 --> 02:39.300
Dawn Tinsley will be coming in this afternoon.

02:39.367 --> 02:40.767
If you've never heard of her before, uh,

02:40.834 --> 02:43.334
she was just a receptionist, worked here for some years.

02:43.400 --> 02:46.901
Um, her and her fiance, Lee, went to Florida.

02:47.133 --> 02:49.601
Yes, Tim, that's "fiance,"

02:49.667 --> 02:51.767
if you know what that word means, um...

02:53.634 --> 02:55.601
Um, maybe you want to keep your thoughts to yourself this time.

02:55.667 --> 02:56.601
(CHUCKLES)

02:57.601 --> 03:00.133
All right, back to it, then.

03:00.801 --> 03:01.834
Please.

03:10.868 --> 03:13.968
Hey. I know what it's like.

03:14.033 --> 03:15.801
I've worked in a lot of places over the years.

03:15.868 --> 03:18.601
And the number of infatuations blokes have had over me...

03:18.667 --> 03:19.834
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

03:19.901 --> 03:21.701
Oh, God.

03:21.767 --> 03:23.500
I mean, they know they can't have me, but that don't stop 'em.

03:23.567 --> 03:25.200
Hmm.

03:25.267 --> 03:26.801
I don't know what it is about me they like so much.

03:26.868 --> 03:27.801
(SCOFFS) Yeah.

03:28.934 --> 03:30.267
I'm racking my brains.

03:31.801 --> 03:32.767
Hmm.

03:41.901 --> 03:43.000
Thanks very much.

03:47.234 --> 03:48.400
-This is nice, isn't it. -Yeah.

03:50.667 --> 03:52.100
-See what's on offer. -(CHUCKLES)

03:57.701 --> 03:58.701
Nice.

04:00.100 --> 04:01.634
No! Your necklace! I wasn't...

04:01.701 --> 04:03.000
Oh!

04:03.067 --> 04:04.334
(BOTH GIGGLE)

04:05.400 --> 04:06.868
I don't think so!

04:06.934 --> 04:10.033
Although, funny enough, the reason women wear necklaces

04:10.100 --> 04:12.434
is to draw attention to the breasts.

04:12.500 --> 04:15.267
-I don't. -No, I mean subconsciously.

04:15.334 --> 04:16.934
-It sort of... -No, I don't.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
I wear it because my mother gave it to me before she died.

04:19.067 --> 04:22.400
Yeah, well, I mean she probably wore it to draw attention to hers.

04:22.467 --> 04:24.100
Sorry, could we not talk about my dead mother's breasts?

04:24.167 --> 04:25.100
Yeah.

04:26.834 --> 04:27.834
(SIGHS)

04:29.434 --> 04:32.868
Uh... Duck pate.

04:42.334 --> 04:44.300
-I wasn't being lewd. About... -I know.

04:44.367 --> 04:47.167
-No, I'm just interested in... -Breasts. (CHUCKLES)

04:47.234 --> 04:49.400
No. Anthropology.

04:49.467 --> 04:52.601
That sort of thing. What signals we give off.

04:52.667 --> 04:53.901
I'm not giving off any signals.

04:53.968 --> 04:55.567
No, I know. We all are.

04:55.634 --> 04:58.234
I saw a programme on the Discovery Channel.

04:58.300 --> 04:59.767
Interesting, it was, uh...

04:59.834 --> 05:03.667
You know the reason why men are attracted to cleavage?

05:03.734 --> 05:06.601
It's because it reminds us of women's buttocks.

05:06.667 --> 05:09.200
Because I suppose presumably, when we were cavemen,

05:09.267 --> 05:10.934
we used to sort of do you from behind.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.434
So we like the...

05:12.500 --> 05:14.968
And then we evolved and probably to enjoy,

05:15.033 --> 05:16.934
when language came in, to either chat

05:17.000 --> 05:20.667
or just to look at the breasts that reminded us of the buttocks,

05:20.734 --> 05:22.834
in the first place.

05:22.901 --> 05:24.434
Can we not talk about breasts full stop?

05:27.634 --> 05:28.834
Want a starter?

05:28.901 --> 05:30.400
No, let's go straight to the main course.

05:52.834 --> 05:57.133
DAWN: I'm actually nervous about seeing everyone again.

05:57.200 --> 05:59.200
I mean, I am conscious that I'm gonna have to answer

05:59.267 --> 06:01.167
the same question about 30 times.

06:01.234 --> 06:03.133
'Cause you know, I'm the one that's been away for a couple of years.

06:03.200 --> 06:04.767
And, um, and I just want to go in and go,

06:04.834 --> 06:08.234
"Right, we're back. It's been lovely weather out there,

06:08.300 --> 06:11.300
"and been doing lots of sunbathing, not going to be an illustrator

06:11.367 --> 06:12.801
"and they haven't made me mayor yet." You know?

06:12.868 --> 06:14.934
"So, where are you tonight? Let's get drunk."

06:15.000 --> 06:18.400
Um... Oh, hang on, sorry. It's here on the left.

06:18.467 --> 06:20.734
Left, thank you.

06:20.801 --> 06:22.567
INTERVIEWER: Why are you not going to be an illustrator any more?

06:22.634 --> 06:24.868
Um, just circumstance, really.

06:24.934 --> 06:28.000
Um, and if someone, you know, said to me, uh,

06:28.067 --> 06:30.968
"Bang, you can be overnight successful illustrator" that'd be great.

06:31.033 --> 06:35.367
And... 'Cause it was my ambition, but it's not going to happen.

06:35.434 --> 06:38.968
So, you know, because of priorities and time,

06:39.033 --> 06:41.701
and... (MUMBLES) You know.

06:41.767 --> 06:43.634
All of that really.

06:44.901 --> 06:46.167
Um, thank you.

06:52.901 --> 06:56.033
TIM: Yeah, I'm looking forward to seeing her again, of course.

06:56.100 --> 06:58.567
She's my friend and she's a good friend, you know.

06:58.634 --> 07:01.834
And, no, I don't know exactly how I'll feel.

07:01.901 --> 07:04.500
I'll feel like a friend feels. Whatever that is, you know.

07:04.567 --> 07:07.767
But as I said, I'm not gonna ask her again. Come on!

07:11.968 --> 07:13.567
I might ask her again.

07:13.634 --> 07:15.234
No, I won't. No, I won't.

07:15.300 --> 07:17.100
I know I won't. I know I won't.

07:19.667 --> 07:20.901
She would have to do the asking.

07:34.934 --> 07:37.500
EMMA: Oh, my God! Hello!

07:37.567 --> 07:39.067
Hi. (CHUCKLES)

07:39.133 --> 07:40.167
How are you?

07:40.234 --> 07:41.467
(ALL LAUGHING EXCITEDLY)

07:42.767 --> 07:44.100
EMMA: You're looking well. DAWN: Thank you.

07:44.167 --> 07:45.400
(KISSES)

07:45.467 --> 07:46.767
Thanks.

07:46.834 --> 07:48.133
-TRUDY: Hello, how're you doing? -Ooh!

07:48.834 --> 07:49.868
No Lee?

07:49.934 --> 07:52.167
Um, no, he's at his mum's.

07:53.234 --> 07:54.634
-GLYNN: Hey. -Hey!

07:54.701 --> 07:57.234
-GLYNN: You're looking very brown. -Oh, okay!

07:57.300 --> 07:58.934
TRUDY: So, what have you been up to?

07:59.000 --> 08:00.567
DAWN: Uh, not much actually.

08:01.934 --> 08:02.834
RALPH: Enjoying life?

08:02.901 --> 08:04.000
Trying to.

08:04.801 --> 08:07.133
This is all the same.

08:07.200 --> 08:08.601
-RALPH: Never changes. -(CHUCKLES)

08:08.667 --> 08:10.133
Can I get you a cup of tea?

08:10.200 --> 08:13.067
I would love one. Thank you. Lovely.

08:13.133 --> 08:14.434
RALPH: It's really good to see you.

08:18.801 --> 08:21.267
Oh, um, actually I think, Gareth might want to see you.

08:21.334 --> 08:23.367
So, shall we go and see the new boss?

08:24.267 --> 08:25.300
Nice to see you.

08:25.901 --> 08:26.834
All right.

08:31.734 --> 08:33.534
-Shall we do it? Are you ready for this? -Yes.

08:33.601 --> 08:34.400
He's the boss!

08:36.567 --> 08:37.634
Argh!

08:38.734 --> 08:41.067
Dawn Tinsley, as I live and breathe.

08:41.133 --> 08:42.167
(CHUCKLES)

08:42.234 --> 08:43.968
-Don't bloody believe this. -Oh!

08:44.033 --> 08:45.567
-Hi. -Come here.

08:45.634 --> 08:46.901
-Oh. -(GRUNTS)

08:46.968 --> 08:48.100
How are you, babes?

08:48.167 --> 08:50.234
(STAMMERING) Fine, darling.

08:50.300 --> 08:52.367
What you doing in America? Let's sit down.

08:52.434 --> 08:53.701
Uh, what did you mean, sorry?

08:53.767 --> 08:55.267
What you doing in America, work-wise?

08:55.334 --> 08:57.367
Oh, okay. Well, it's complicated.

08:57.434 --> 08:59.234
'Cause you have to have a work permit.

08:59.300 --> 09:01.234
Sure, sure.

09:01.300 --> 09:04.334
Just gonna say, if you are struggling, you're always welcome back here.

09:04.400 --> 09:06.934
Things have changed a little bit around here, he'll tell you.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.067
I'm quite a powerful man.

09:09.133 --> 09:12.534
If you did come back, you wouldn't necessary be working behind reception.

09:12.601 --> 09:14.534
I always did think you were a hard worker,

09:14.601 --> 09:16.767
if a little bit... But...

09:16.834 --> 09:19.000
You still trying to be an artist?

09:19.667 --> 09:21.133
-No. -Good.

09:21.200 --> 09:23.834
Good. Waste of time, practically thinking.

09:23.901 --> 09:26.634
Moving on, that's good. Because you're no spring chicken.

09:26.701 --> 09:28.634
-Um... -No.

09:31.133 --> 09:32.434
(DIALLING)

09:33.701 --> 09:34.500
(PHONE RINGS)

09:38.334 --> 09:39.934
-WOMAN: Hello? -Is that, Gillian?

09:40.000 --> 09:41.567
Yeah. Who's this?

09:41.634 --> 09:44.067
Um, you're one of my introductions from the agency.

09:44.133 --> 09:46.968
-Oh, yeah, yeah, hi. -Hi.

09:47.033 --> 09:48.634
-You all right? -Yeah.

09:48.701 --> 09:52.801
Um, how do you usually do these things?

09:52.868 --> 09:57.100
Um, well, depends really. Just have a chat on the phone,

09:57.167 --> 09:59.000
sometimes meet up.

09:59.067 --> 10:01.868
Uh, you know, you wear a carnation, carry a newspaper.

10:01.934 --> 10:03.868
-(CHUCKLES ) So... -Oh!

10:03.934 --> 10:05.834
To help recognise me!

10:05.901 --> 10:08.334
You probably won't need that. You probably will recognise me.

10:08.400 --> 10:10.801
-Will I? Why is that? -Yeah.

10:10.868 --> 10:15.567
Did you see, um, a documentary on BBC Two called The Office?

10:15.634 --> 10:18.968
Yeah. God, you're not that awful boss are you?

10:19.033 --> 10:21.000
No, not the... No.

10:21.067 --> 10:22.334
-What's your name? -Huh?

10:22.400 --> 10:23.601
What's your... What's your name?

10:24.801 --> 10:26.601
What's my name or what's his name?

10:26.667 --> 10:28.434
I don't know why you want his name... (GIGGLES)

10:28.500 --> 10:30.934
Can I... Oh, no. Just... Can I...

10:31.000 --> 10:32.400
Can I call you back, Gillian?

10:32.467 --> 10:34.167
I've got a... Uh, see you.

10:34.234 --> 10:35.234
-(SWITCHES OFF PHONE) -Oh.

10:36.567 --> 10:38.667
(STAMMERING)

10:38.734 --> 10:41.267
Oh, "Who are you? What's your name?"

10:41.334 --> 10:42.534
Too many questions.

10:42.601 --> 10:46.200
God, chill out. GBH the ears! No, no, no.

10:46.267 --> 10:47.934
Not for me, thank you.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.634
Back to the drawing board.

10:54.367 --> 10:56.801
We're having the toilets done in January.

10:56.868 --> 10:58.367
Did he tell you?

10:58.434 --> 11:00.167
Tim, you didn't tell me about the toilets!

11:00.234 --> 11:02.367
Sorry, I had other things on my mind.

11:02.434 --> 11:06.267
-Like, Gareth, are you still in the TAs? -Yeah.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.400
-What rank are you? -Lieutenant.

11:09.467 --> 11:11.667
Are you? Because I was thinking,

11:11.734 --> 11:14.334
if you ever take an enemy soldier prisoner, right,

11:14.400 --> 11:16.133
would you have to search him?

11:16.200 --> 11:17.634
Yeah, it's possible, yeah.

11:17.701 --> 11:19.234
TIM: Right, so let's just say, you've got a prisoner

11:19.300 --> 11:20.667
you're doing a full body search,

11:20.734 --> 11:22.500
you find something hard, you can feel it.

11:22.567 --> 11:24.634
You know what it is, do you just say to him,

11:24.701 --> 11:26.467
"I know you've got a big weapon, give it to me now."

11:26.534 --> 11:27.767
-Or... -(CHUCKLES)

11:27.834 --> 11:29.667
I not gonna ask him.

11:29.734 --> 11:31.567
I'd most likely just get it out myself.

11:31.634 --> 11:32.734
TIM: Right.

11:32.801 --> 11:34.200
And what happens,

11:34.267 --> 11:35.901
you're going into battle situation, right,

11:36.100 --> 11:37.834
are you up the front with your men,

11:37.901 --> 11:40.200
or are you coming up the rear?

11:40.267 --> 11:41.767
Well, depends.

11:41.834 --> 11:43.567
It's possible you'd come up the rear.

11:44.267 --> 11:45.267
Possible, yeah.

11:45.334 --> 11:46.634
That's all we wanted to know.

11:48.200 --> 11:49.200
GARETH: What?

11:55.300 --> 11:58.434
Well, yeah, it's like actual sort of... He's got those clunky shoes thing on

11:58.500 --> 12:01.367
and with the silver... No, with the silver link buckle across.

12:01.434 --> 12:03.000
-(LAUGHING) That's a progress. -He's like that.

12:03.067 --> 12:04.000
He still looks like a golf club.

12:04.067 --> 12:06.534
Dawn. Ann, yeah?

12:06.601 --> 12:08.167
Oh, hi. It's nice to meet you.

12:09.500 --> 12:11.567
(GROANS)

12:11.634 --> 12:14.000
Oh, must tell you this. He had a laugh the other day. Well, the other week.

12:14.067 --> 12:15.601
You know Paul Wallis?

12:15.667 --> 12:17.500
From Harpers?

12:17.567 --> 12:19.667
No, no, no. Not any more, he's up at Silver Leaf now.

12:19.734 --> 12:22.300
Anyway, he's talking to Mel on reception, and he's chatting away,

12:22.367 --> 12:26.133
and I'm listening to him and he's talking to her about 10 minutes or so, isn't he?

12:26.200 --> 12:30.467
And then he says, "Dawn, have you changed your hair?"

12:30.534 --> 12:33.267
He thought she was you. He didn't realise you'd left.

12:33.334 --> 12:35.267
I laughed! I shouted out,

12:35.467 --> 12:37.000
I said, "Paul, do you think that's Dawn?"

12:37.067 --> 12:38.467
He thought it was you.

12:38.534 --> 12:40.000
(LAUGHS)

12:40.067 --> 12:42.167
-Extraordinary. -ANN: Hmm.

12:42.234 --> 12:43.767
How's your husband? Is he here?

12:43.834 --> 12:46.334
Oh, no. He's not my husband yet. So...

12:46.400 --> 12:47.534
You gonna have children?

12:48.367 --> 12:50.200
Not that I'm aware of.

12:50.267 --> 12:52.167
-Word of advice. -Hmm.

12:52.234 --> 12:53.801
Have them sooner, rather than later,

12:53.868 --> 12:55.601
'cause there's nothing worse than an old mum.

13:00.767 --> 13:02.634
I'm gonna shoot off.

13:02.701 --> 13:05.500
-Do you want another cup, or... -No, I'm fine. Thank you.

13:05.567 --> 13:07.567
Really good to see you. Thanks for coming in.

13:08.901 --> 13:10.067
Well...

13:10.133 --> 13:12.100
-Dawn... -How you doing?

13:12.167 --> 13:14.334
You coming to the Christmas party?

13:14.400 --> 13:18.834
Uh, yes. Although we've got to leave early 'cause got to get back the next day.

13:18.901 --> 13:19.968
-Have you? -Hmm.

13:20.033 --> 13:21.500
We'll have a good old chat then.

13:23.901 --> 13:26.000
Okay, see you, everybody.

13:26.067 --> 13:27.167
-See you. -Really nice...

13:28.767 --> 13:29.968
Well, I'll see you soon.

13:36.934 --> 13:37.901

13:45.634 --> 13:48.500
-What's that? -A sketch of me.

13:48.567 --> 13:50.968
Dawn's a bit of an artist.

13:51.033 --> 13:53.300
That's not very accurate. Your nose is much bigger than that.

14:06.300 --> 14:08.968
Yeah, spoke to her on the phone. She seemed quite nice, so, uh...

14:09.033 --> 14:11.434
Feel a bit sick really, not nerves.

14:11.500 --> 14:14.500
Excitement, really. Not sexual, you know.

14:14.567 --> 14:17.701
Um, she says she'll be wearing a white chiffon scarf to help me spot her.

14:17.767 --> 14:18.801
So, um...

14:18.868 --> 14:21.000

-Can I get you a drink? -No, I'll get one. Have you got one?

14:29.100 --> 14:30.734
-I've got one. -You go and sit down. I'll get one.

-I love Grieg. -Oh, he's good, yeah.

15:13.334 --> 15:14.834
Not as good as Beethoven, though.

I think he's generally considered to the best by ever.

15:17.534 --> 15:19.467
-Which Beethoven do you like? -All his main hits.

Well, I'm a musician myself.

15:27.868 --> 15:29.901
All those stuff he came up with.

15:29.968 --> 15:32.901
I don't think he could have done better if he'd heard what he was playing.

-Cows. -Cows. Cows have got four stomachs.

16:08.868 --> 16:09.834
Right.

Don't look at me like that. You said cows. Choose anything.

I said, choose anything.

-Lemons. -Lemons?

16:19.334 --> 16:21.067
-Well, I can choose something else. -No, you said lemons.

16:52.367 --> 16:56.567
Um, well, not bowled over, to be honest.

16:56.634 --> 16:59.167
In fact, I'm seriously thinking of asking for money back

16:59.234 --> 17:00.534
under the trades descriptions act.

17:00.601 --> 17:03.767
Because, this is the recent photo she sent in.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.834
I'd have been up for that.

17:08.901 --> 17:11.567
And what really annoys me is when I first saw her, I thought, "Oh God."

17:11.634 --> 17:13.133
And then I thought, "Well, you know,

17:13.200 --> 17:16.033
"maybe she's got a good personality." She hasn't.

17:16.100 --> 17:17.601

Tell them about the Secret Santa.

18:08.934 --> 18:11.133
All right, okay, um... This is Secret Santa,

18:11.200 --> 18:13.667
basically everybody gets a piece of paper, writes their name on it,

18:13.734 --> 18:15.133
puts it in the box,

18:15.200 --> 18:16.767
and we jiggle it around, and then somebody

18:16.834 --> 18:18.734
takes a piece of paper out with a name on it.

18:18.801 --> 18:21.801
And they have to buy that person a present worth about £10.

18:21.868 --> 18:23.434
But you keep a secret.

18:23.500 --> 18:25.234
You're not allowed to know who bought you the gift.

22:08.200 --> 22:10.500
-NEIL: David... -Why is that funny?

22:10.567 --> 22:12.234
-Hi. -Hi, can I have a word, please?

22:12.300 --> 22:13.267
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:15.434 --> 22:16.868
Alone.

22:16.934 --> 22:18.767
He can't understand you.

22:18.834 --> 22:21.133
-No, I meant... People. -Oh, the people, yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:21.200 --> 22:22.400
Come on, Nelson.

22:27.100 --> 22:28.334
What's your reason for being here, David?

22:28.400 --> 22:30.701
Oh, I don't know. Is friendship a reason?

22:30.767 --> 22:32.634
No, not really, and I've just seen you spend 10 minutes

22:32.701 --> 22:34.567
introducing people to your dog.

22:34.634 --> 22:36.367
Oh, all right, so he's not allowed to come in and chat to people now?

22:36.434 --> 22:38.500
Well, I don't know what he's chatting about...

22:38.567 --> 22:40.734
Sarcasm. Lowest form of wit.

22:40.801 --> 22:44.133
-I don't know what he's chatting about... -And again.

22:44.200 --> 22:47.100
If he is here to crack jokes then he should be doing it in his own time.

22:47.167 --> 22:49.634
This is a place of business. It's not a social club.

22:49.701 --> 22:51.567
Typical, yeah, yeah.

22:51.634 --> 22:53.033
You don't like it because I'm popular. I was snatched away from it.

22:53.100 --> 22:54.801
You don't like me coming back 'cause it reminds them...

22:54.868 --> 22:56.467
No, I don't like the fact that you're interrupting a working day.

22:56.534 --> 22:59.067
And it's not just today. You seem to be here all the time.

22:59.133 --> 23:01.667
When you were working here, would you allow people just to breeze in?

23:01.734 --> 23:02.868
-Yeah. -Making chitchat?

23:02.934 --> 23:04.834
-Distracting people from their work? -Yes.

23:04.901 --> 23:06.868
-What do you mean "yes"? -Yes, if it was good for morale.

23:06.934 --> 23:08.133
And it is good for morale.

23:08.200 --> 23:10.100
So, you should paying me to be here.

23:10.167 --> 23:13.267
Paying you? David, you don't work here. You have no reason to be here.

23:13.334 --> 23:15.901
Unless you've a genuine reason to be here during working hours,

23:15.968 --> 23:17.901
you can't keep strolling in unannounced.

23:18.100 --> 23:19.701
-Right. -Whenever you like.

23:19.767 --> 23:21.801
So I'm banned, 'cause the regime don't like it, man.

23:21.868 --> 23:23.367
You don't work here, David.

23:23.434 --> 23:25.367
You can't keep coming in for a natter.

23:25.434 --> 23:27.100
Oh, can I come in for a meeting then?

23:27.167 --> 23:29.200
Well, I don't know what sort of meetings you'd have here.

23:29.267 --> 23:30.901
Who knows? If I had an excuse for a meeting, could I come for meeting?

23:30.968 --> 23:32.701
-Well, yes, of course if it was a business... -Fine.

23:32.767 --> 23:34.701
-Okay. -What?

23:34.767 --> 23:36.868
-Fine. -I mean you can't keep popping in unannounced.

23:36.934 --> 23:39.934
-Come on, Nelson. He doesn't like you. -David...

23:40.000 --> 23:41.567
Oh, let's see how they take...

23:41.634 --> 23:43.067
Oh, political news, everyone.

23:43.133 --> 23:45.167
Very interesting development.

23:45.234 --> 23:48.767
I've been barred from coming here to see you, friends,

23:48.834 --> 23:51.834
by the powers that be that deem it I undermine the regime.

23:51.901 --> 23:53.500
'Caused they are scared.

23:53.567 --> 23:55.701
So, can't stop me seeing you after work, though.

23:55.767 --> 23:57.734
Who wants to go for a drink tomorrow? To show...

23:59.167 --> 24:00.234
Yeah?

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
Anyone?

24:04.300 --> 24:06.701
Short notice. What about day after that?

24:06.767 --> 24:09.033
Have a beer, just...

24:11.133 --> 24:13.300
Thursday's good. For me, anyway.

24:15.801 --> 24:16.868
What's good for you?

24:19.400 --> 24:21.367
I can still come for meetings.

24:21.434 --> 24:23.567
'Course, uh... Who wants a meeting?

24:23.634 --> 24:25.901
No one wants a meeting with you, no one wants a drink with you.

24:26.100 --> 24:27.968
You don't even work here.

24:28.033 --> 24:29.834
Yeah, I'll have a drink with you tomorrow, David.

24:29.901 --> 24:31.667
-Yeah. -Give us a call, after work, yeah?

24:31.734 --> 24:32.868
All right.

24:32.934 --> 24:34.801
-Oh, there he is. -David...

24:34.868 --> 24:36.734
Let's get you home, boy, before he bars you from the office.

24:36.801 --> 24:38.067
He is barred.

24:38.133 --> 24:40.100
Ooh, taking it out on animals.

24:40.167 --> 24:41.400
There's your evidence.

24:44.701 --> 24:45.834
Fight it. Don't...

24:48.601 --> 24:49.701
Come on, boy.

25:07.734 --> 25:08.868
(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

25:21.234 --> 25:23.968
(INAUDIBLE)

25:29.634 --> 25:31.634
DAVID: I don't want to do these any more.

25:31.701 --> 25:33.367
-PETE: Oh, don't be silly. -I'm not being silly, Pete.

25:33.434 --> 25:36.400
It's just demeaning. It's a load of idiots.

25:36.467 --> 25:38.701
-They loved you. -They didn't love me, they didn't care.

25:38.767 --> 25:40.400
If they love me, why were they throwing stuff?

25:40.467 --> 25:44.801
Throwing water, plastic bottles, underpants.

25:44.868 --> 25:47.667
One bloke threw a pair of Y-fronts, hit me in the face,

25:47.734 --> 25:52.100
yeah, and I knew it was Nutella or Marmite he'd smudged on the gusset.

25:52.167 --> 25:56.000
But it was still him going, "That's what we think of you mate. You're shit."

25:56.200 --> 25:58.801
Where'd he get marmite from?

25:58.868 --> 26:00.801
He must have prepared that at home 'cause he knew you were on.

26:02.801 --> 26:04.634
Well, that doesn't make me feel any better. Why say that?

26:04.701 --> 26:06.500
I'm not gonna do this any more.

26:06.567 --> 26:08.400
PETE: Look, let me tell you.

26:09.734 --> 26:11.834
I've heard this before.

26:11.901 --> 26:15.100
All right, I remember hearing this exact same thing before from Bruno Brookes.

26:15.167 --> 26:18.934
I remember he used to come off stage in tears, sometimes. I'll tell why?

26:19.000 --> 26:20.334
'Cause you're perfectionists.

26:20.934 --> 26:22.567
Yes. I am.

26:22.634 --> 26:25.734
Because I've got stuff to say to the world.

26:25.801 --> 26:28.133
Not just wave. It's just waving!

26:28.200 --> 26:29.300
Why is it waiving?

26:29.367 --> 26:30.901
Shall I say you want to do less waving?

26:30.968 --> 26:32.133
Not, the point.

26:32.200 --> 26:33.767
They're not my audience.

26:33.834 --> 26:36.567
Get me some of the... You know, I'm an anecdotalist.

26:36.634 --> 26:38.200
Get me on...

26:38.267 --> 26:40.467
-I tell you who I'd hit it off with. -Who?

26:40.534 --> 26:41.601
Parkinson.

26:43.267 --> 26:46.033
Um, yeah, that could be tricky. The...

26:46.100 --> 26:48.934
The trouble with that, is that Parky tends to have people on his show

26:49.000 --> 26:51.534
that have actually done something, you know.

26:51.601 --> 26:53.634
-People who have won an Oscar... -Not always.

26:53.701 --> 26:55.634
Not always, I saw one with that...

26:55.701 --> 26:58.534
Who was that bloke who was a hostage in Beirut, chained to a radiator?

26:58.601 --> 27:00.667
-Uh, John McCarthy. -Yeah, what's that?

27:00.734 --> 27:02.200
"Oh, so what did you do all day?"

27:02.267 --> 27:03.701
"Nothing. I was chained to a radiator."

27:03.767 --> 27:05.100
Boring. Next.

27:05.167 --> 27:06.767
And what's he done since? Nothing.

27:06.834 --> 27:08.901
I've got anecdotes. I've got stuff to say,

27:09.100 --> 27:11.100
if people would listen, but they won't.

27:12.300 --> 27:14.367
Well, I'll see what I can do.

27:14.434 --> 27:16.167
But, in the meantime, you're down at Malibu's in Bracknell, Wednesday week.

27:18.033 --> 27:20.100
(SIGHS)

27:20.167 --> 27:22.067
Call, definitely call Parky. Do you know anyone?

27:22.133 --> 27:24.767
-Do you know anyone? -Yeah, I'll sort it out, don't worry.

27:25.601 --> 27:27.133
I know a bloke,

27:27.200 --> 27:30.133
um, used to work on the show, I think, in the '70s.

27:30.200 --> 27:32.167
Um, he's retired now, but he's...

27:33.200 --> 27:35.000
He still knows Parky, I think.

27:41.500 --> 27:46.100
DAVID: When I'm on the road and I'm staying away,

27:46.167 --> 27:49.400
it's good to get back to your room after one of those and just...

27:49.467 --> 27:52.634
You know, this is fairly typical for me.

27:52.701 --> 27:56.434
You know, I like to... It just helps me relax.

27:56.500 --> 27:59.067
Some people like a hot bath.

27:59.133 --> 28:00.767
That's my Radox. (CHUCKLES)

28:02.500 --> 28:03.167
Uh...

28:08.868 --> 28:10.534
But, you know...

28:10.601 --> 28:15.400
Neil will make one too many mistakes.

28:15.467 --> 28:17.300
Head office will see what I always knew,

28:17.367 --> 28:19.200
and they'll go in there, they'll march in there,

28:19.267 --> 28:21.234
and they'll go, "Yeah, Dave was right,

28:21.300 --> 28:23.868
"you've pissed off here, you've pissed off him,

28:23.934 --> 28:27.400
"you're not the manager you think you are.

28:27.467 --> 28:28.734
"Okay?

28:28.801 --> 28:31.267
"So, get out. We made the mistake."

28:31.334 --> 28:32.834
And they'll drag him out by his hair.

28:32.901 --> 28:34.300
And that's when the begging starts.

28:34.367 --> 28:35.734
And then they'll come to me.

28:35.801 --> 28:37.367
And they'll go, "Oh, David, we've got rid of him,

28:37.434 --> 28:38.500
"You were right all along, could you come back?

28:38.567 --> 28:40.167
"You're the man for this job.

28:40.234 --> 28:42.067
"You're the best man for this job. Will you come back?

28:42.133 --> 28:45.567
"Oh, yeah, sure. How much money have you got? 'Cause this is gonna cost ya.

28:47.868 --> 28:49.234
"This is gonna cost ya."

28:55.300 --> 28:56.734

29:03.801 --> 29:05.601

-I'm in the Pink. Do you want to see it? -Yeah, I get it.

29:50.801 --> 29:52.567
Yeah, Pink. She's good. She's wicked.

29:52.634 --> 29:54.234
-Oh... -Coming to the party?

29:54.300 --> 29:56.567
Big time. What time's the meal beforehand?

29:56.634 --> 29:57.767
I think I'd better line my stomach.

29:57.834 --> 29:59.167
I need to speak to you about that.

29:59.234 --> 30:00.834
Management have had a discussion.

30:00.901 --> 30:03.000
Operated on this above my head.

30:03.067 --> 30:05.467
But, uh, decided only present employees of the company can come to the meal.

30:06.500 --> 30:08.834
So...

30:08.901 --> 30:11.701
Yeah, I'm not worried about that. I don't want to come to the meal.

30:11.767 --> 30:13.234
-I'm just... -Good.

30:13.300 --> 30:14.934
'Cause you won't be allowed if you did turn up, so...

30:15.000 --> 30:17.868
I don't want to. Listen to me.

30:17.934 --> 30:19.367
Who's idea was that? Neil's?

30:19.434 --> 30:23.200
-Might have been Neil's, yeah. -Oh, there's a surprise.

30:23.267 --> 30:24.334
No one else is invited who doesn't work here?

30:24.400 --> 30:26.067
Dawn's not invited to the meal or anything?

30:26.133 --> 30:28.367
-No. -Fine.

30:28.434 --> 30:30.801
I know what he's doing. I know what he's up to.

30:30.868 --> 30:33.801
-I could probably have a word with Neil, if you want me to. -(SCOFFS)

30:33.868 --> 30:35.767
Nothing you can do. You're just a puppet.

30:35.834 --> 30:38.367
I take it I can still bring a woman to this party?

30:38.434 --> 30:39.801
Yeah, if you can find one.

30:39.868 --> 30:41.133
What do you mean, "If I find one"?

30:41.200 --> 30:43.267
-I've found one. -Have you? Which one?

30:43.334 --> 30:44.634
What do you mean, "Which one?"

30:44.701 --> 30:46.467
Off the list. Which one of the list.

30:46.534 --> 30:48.634
She might not be on the list. I might have met her in the pub.

30:48.701 --> 30:50.334
-Did you? -No.

30:50.400 --> 30:52.934
She's on the list, but don't assume, that's all.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.367
-Never assume. It makes an ass... -BOTH: ...out of you and me.

30:55.434 --> 30:56.968
-I say that. -Yeah, I know you do, yeah.

31:01.968 --> 31:03.200
What time's the meal finish?

31:03.267 --> 31:04.500
9:00, 9:30.

31:04.567 --> 31:07.267
9:30... What am I gonna do for three hours?

31:12.234 --> 31:13.434

Shall we shoot off to a club and come back when this place livens up?

Jesus Christ! That's not what I used to do in my day.

-On her way, so don't... -Yeah?

So don't think...

32:24.667 --> 32:26.267
Fashionably late. Not even late, actually.

32:26.334 --> 32:28.701
Told her to come down about half nine, 10:00.

43:45.868 --> 43:48.534
You don't know them. I mean, it wasn't your choice,

43:48.601 --> 43:52.801
and yet you spend more time with them than you do your friends or your family.

43:52.868 --> 43:55.767
But probably all you've got in common is the fact that you

43:55.834 --> 43:58.901
walk around on the same bit carpet for eight hours a day.

44:00.968 --> 44:01.968
And so,

44:02.868 --> 44:05.334
obviously when someone

44:05.400 --> 44:09.033
comes in who you have a connection with...

44:09.100 --> 44:12.100
Yeah! And Dawn was a ray of sunshine in my life.

44:12.167 --> 44:13.300
And it meant a lot.

44:15.400 --> 44:17.567
But...

44:17.634 --> 44:20.167

44:40.734 --> 44:43.801
Life isn't about endings, is it? It's a series of moments.

44:44.767 --> 44:47.334
And, um...

44:47.400 --> 44:50.434
It's like, if you turn the camera off, it's not an ending, is it?

44:51.601 --> 44:53.901
I'm still here. My life's not over.

44:53.968 --> 44:56.334
Come back here in 10 years,

44:56.400 --> 44:59.334
see how I'm doing then.

44:59.400 --> 45:01.834

DAVID: No, I wasn't holding a lot of hope for this evening, but...

45:48.000 --> 45:50.100
She is a brilliant woman.

45:51.133 --> 45:53.334
Smart, logical.

45:53.400 --> 45:55.100
And you hear people say,

45:55.167 --> 45:58.968
that you can't be a beautiful, sensual woman like Carol

45:59.033 --> 46:00.300
and still be logical.

46:00.367 --> 46:02.300
She's proved them wrong.

46:02.367 --> 46:03.734
So, you know, part of the attraction.

46:03.801 --> 46:06.901
In fact, for me to be attracted to a woman,

46:06.968 --> 46:10.400
she has to be as intelligent, or slightly less intelligent, than me.

46:10.467 --> 46:12.000
She is.

46:12.067 --> 46:14.267
You know, and never been impressed with these guys that go,

46:14.334 --> 46:16.434
"Oh, look at her, she's got a great pair of breasts,"

46:16.500 --> 46:18.834
or, "She's got a cute little tush."

46:18.901 --> 46:22.167
I mean, Carol's got all those things,

46:22.234 --> 46:25.100
but she's got it going on upstairs as well as down.

46:25.801 --> 46:27.367

Yeah, he wants to try my Thai food. That's okay.

46:38.367 --> 46:41.534
Yeah, I had a good chat with him.

46:41.601 --> 46:43.667

Two weeks, a grand each.
