00:00.283 --> 00:01.483
_

00:01.508 --> 00:03.575
- So how was your day off?
- I killed someone.

00:03.756 --> 00:05.756
Gail Rahimi, 42.

00:05.781 --> 00:07.546
Sickle cell disease.

00:07.957 --> 00:09.949
I thought you might need my phone.

00:09.974 --> 00:13.317
I'm a nurse. We were here
together the whole time.

00:13.352 --> 00:16.279
- And you are?
- Mary Harris. I used to work at Eden General.

00:16.303 --> 00:18.422
- Now, I work in hospice.
- Name of the hospice?

00:18.458 --> 00:21.181
- Joys.
- I admitted a new patient yesterday.

00:21.206 --> 00:23.360
- You must be...
- Lucy.

00:23.396 --> 00:25.959
- Desmond.
- Jesus, Jess. What happened?

00:25.984 --> 00:28.132
- Heather dumped me.
- To forget her...

00:28.167 --> 00:31.141
- you have to...
- Destroy her!

00:31.898 --> 00:35.897
- Run, dummy! You gotta run!
- We get a 911 last night.

00:35.922 --> 00:37.891
Guess who's on the scene?

00:37.916 --> 00:41.100
Dr. Mary Harris. The
angel of death herself.

00:41.125 --> 00:43.260
She's pregnant. Five months, maybe.

01:01.739 --> 01:03.674
Living the dream, right?

01:04.675 --> 01:08.209
A big, beautiful,
murderous deathy dream.

01:08.456 --> 01:10.189
Unless, of course, the cops show up.

01:11.300 --> 01:12.475
Des, it's been a week.

01:12.500 --> 01:13.699
We haven't heard anything.

01:14.941 --> 01:17.479
Well, I guess we live to
fight another day then.

01:23.621 --> 01:25.720
There's something very liberating

01:25.745 --> 01:29.125
about just lying back

01:29.785 --> 01:32.028
and waving your arms and legs around,

01:32.426 --> 01:34.196
forgetting everything except

01:35.128 --> 01:37.847
the cold air on your skin.

01:39.777 --> 01:41.308
Leaving your mark.

01:43.207 --> 01:45.112
At least until the snow falls again.

01:45.137 --> 01:48.177
I must say, that's one of
our stranger last requests.

01:53.817 --> 01:56.951
- Are you comfortable?
- Perfection.

01:57.211 --> 01:58.854
I mean, apart from the cancer.

02:13.523 --> 02:16.638
It smells like fresh baked
bread and a hint of limestone.

02:16.674 --> 02:18.740
Sounds like you know your champagne.

02:18.954 --> 02:20.655
I've had a few of these in my day.

02:23.868 --> 02:25.700
Time for my dying wish.

02:27.542 --> 02:30.176
Your baby. Who's the father?

02:32.005 --> 02:33.470
Did you love him at least?

02:34.018 --> 02:37.592
Now, now, Martha, I'm
starting to think you're stalling.

02:37.627 --> 02:40.595
- Are you having second thoughts?
- Not at all.

02:42.833 --> 02:46.703
The beauty of how I lived my life...

02:47.896 --> 02:51.464
I... made my own choices
all the way through.

02:51.489 --> 02:53.761
I... I travelled.

02:53.786 --> 02:56.713
I... slept with a thousand men.

02:58.715 --> 03:00.382
I did whatever I wanted.

03:02.015 --> 03:04.382
And I'm getting to do this my way too.

03:07.287 --> 03:08.408
It was...

03:08.763 --> 03:10.669
the fullest life

03:11.435 --> 03:12.481
in the world.

04:39.049 --> 04:40.912
So, what were you doing out there?

04:41.452 --> 04:45.284
Nothing like a brisk outing
in the wintry dawn to...

04:45.725 --> 04:48.263
wake up the bone tired body.

04:49.488 --> 04:51.323
Are you having trouble sleeping?

04:51.569 --> 04:55.394
I can sleep just fine if I'd let myself.

04:56.286 --> 04:57.640
What's stopping you?

04:58.039 --> 05:00.562
Death is a sneaky bugger.

05:01.359 --> 05:02.701
I don't want him to...

05:03.149 --> 05:06.884
ambush me in my sleep. I want to decide,

05:07.827 --> 05:09.417
die with my boots on.

05:10.733 --> 05:12.010
You want to control it?

05:16.250 --> 05:19.650
I used to be terrified
of death when I was kid.

05:20.092 --> 05:21.987
It kept me up at night too.

05:22.022 --> 05:23.581
The scariest thing was that

05:23.606 --> 05:25.906
nobody ever really talked about it.

05:26.809 --> 05:28.515
Is that why you became a doctor?

05:29.687 --> 05:31.529
I learned that there are things

05:31.564 --> 05:33.466
that you can do to prolong life.

05:34.993 --> 05:38.636
But sometimes, there's
nothing you can do except...

05:38.661 --> 05:41.821
Grab it before it grabs you.

05:44.415 --> 05:46.548
Though sometimes, I wish I could just...

05:48.261 --> 05:49.910
... start all over again.

05:51.315 --> 05:52.331
Be a boy.

05:56.788 --> 05:58.154
See my mother.

06:00.996 --> 06:02.293
Maybe you do.

06:07.567 --> 06:10.734
Only you would use your free
period to actually study.

06:10.769 --> 06:12.979
- You nerd.
- Yeah.

06:13.004 --> 06:15.364
Well, I actually want
to go to college, so...

06:15.389 --> 06:17.620
studying seems like a step
in the right direction.

06:17.645 --> 06:19.598
The future is overrated.

06:19.794 --> 06:21.146
What's that supposed to mean?

06:22.681 --> 06:24.381
Do you ever feel crazy?

06:26.873 --> 06:27.958
Uh...

06:27.983 --> 06:29.586
Yeah, sometimes.

06:31.826 --> 06:32.872
Do you?

06:32.897 --> 06:34.959
Sometimes, I want to
have sex with myself

06:34.984 --> 06:37.209
and then other times, I
wanna slit my own throat,

06:37.234 --> 06:38.334
so...

06:41.281 --> 06:43.815
Yeah, that's pretty crazy.

06:43.949 --> 06:46.213
Why don't we ditch school
and do something fun? Hm?

06:47.157 --> 06:49.516
Oh man, you've been
blowing me off all week.

06:50.142 --> 06:51.908
We can go to my house.
You can work there.

06:52.852 --> 06:55.088
You can use my mom's
office. She's not back yet.

06:55.113 --> 06:56.346
Yeah, right.

06:56.797 --> 06:59.230
You'd probably set my books on fire.

07:02.727 --> 07:04.329
I just really gotta finish this.

07:05.623 --> 07:08.958
- We can hang out later.
- When?

07:08.994 --> 07:10.693
I don't know. Um...

07:10.728 --> 07:11.861
This weekend.

07:18.485 --> 07:21.959
So... I read your report.

07:22.529 --> 07:25.740
- And?
- And I gotta say, man,

07:25.765 --> 07:27.330
I can't see what you're seeing.

07:28.029 --> 07:29.567
It says the victim died

07:29.592 --> 07:31.926
of an insulin overdose, right? Insulin.

07:32.203 --> 07:33.724
That's never been Mary's MO.

07:33.749 --> 07:35.885
Yeah, forget the insulin.
It's bigger than that.

07:36.248 --> 07:38.381
Because Mary said that
she was there to consult

07:38.406 --> 07:40.207
the victim on hospice care, yeah?

07:40.627 --> 07:42.494
So, I got to thinking, like, what if...

07:43.327 --> 07:47.696
What if this hospice,
this Joys... is a cover?

07:48.719 --> 07:50.731
Like a way for Mary to meet patients?

07:50.766 --> 07:52.688
Maybe. But what if she found a place

07:52.713 --> 07:55.529
where she can get a bunch of
terminal patients together...

07:56.705 --> 07:59.540
... kill them, and no
one would ever find out?

08:00.389 --> 08:01.443
Hmm?

08:02.244 --> 08:03.677
Mary's a smart woman.

08:04.456 --> 08:06.259
She would never take a risk like that.

08:07.352 --> 08:08.456
Maybe not.

08:09.485 --> 08:12.021
But if she was running some
kind of death factory up there...

08:13.556 --> 08:14.738
this could be huge.

08:15.458 --> 08:17.391
Right? Come on, this
could be front page...

08:17.416 --> 08:20.383
Yeah, man. A real
career-maker. Absolutely.

08:23.871 --> 08:25.684
Did you tell anyone else about this?

08:26.248 --> 08:28.223
No. No, no, no. Not yet,

08:28.248 --> 08:30.297
because the whole Harris case is...

08:31.273 --> 08:33.073
- It's a bit of a...
- A bit of a what?

08:33.684 --> 08:37.284
Come on, say it. What, an embarrassment
to the whole department?

08:37.989 --> 08:40.124
I got played by a couple
of women and a carwash,

08:40.148 --> 08:42.683
- is that what they're all saying?
- No...

08:43.835 --> 08:45.686
Look, man, it's gonna
take a hell of a lot

08:45.721 --> 08:48.755
more than your theory to
get them to reopen this case.

08:49.225 --> 08:50.324
I know.

08:52.348 --> 08:54.552
I'll take a look... off the record.

08:54.577 --> 08:56.563
If I find anything, I will let you know.

08:56.598 --> 08:58.031
And vice versa, okay?

09:05.021 --> 09:07.074
I think we need to do Robert today.

09:07.099 --> 09:09.755
I found him wandering around
the property this morning.

09:10.093 --> 09:11.620
Terminal agitation.

09:11.645 --> 09:13.278
Which means the end is nigh.

09:13.388 --> 09:16.382
He's afraid he's going to die and
his sleep before we get to him.

09:16.706 --> 09:18.031
Not on my watch.

09:18.121 --> 09:19.532
- This afternoon, then?
- Yeah.

09:20.446 --> 09:24.023
- Okay. I'll set it up.
- I kind of love Robert.

09:26.487 --> 09:28.619
I'm gonna miss having
morning tea with him.

09:32.832 --> 09:36.166
Oh, my God! When do I get
as callused-over as you two?

09:37.351 --> 09:39.872
- It's always hard.
- A little bit over another month.

09:40.640 --> 09:43.973
Well, Robert deserves
a monarch butterfly.

09:44.379 --> 09:45.718
A classic, like him.

09:51.786 --> 09:54.857
I'm going to go take a walk.

09:55.037 --> 09:56.355
Clear my head a bit.

10:00.913 --> 10:03.829
Dr. Harris! Hi!

10:04.641 --> 10:07.166
- Quite a place you got up here!
- Can I help you?

10:07.262 --> 10:09.262
We need to talk. Can we go inside?

10:09.376 --> 10:12.300
- No, I'm afraid not.
- Seriously? It's freezing.

10:12.325 --> 10:15.641
- I know. I'm working. I'm sorry.
- That's actually why I'm here.

10:16.090 --> 10:18.887
I need your help. I have a patient.

10:18.912 --> 10:21.447
Her name is Dorothy
Rosemond, and she's dying.

10:22.003 --> 10:23.736
She needs help, so I thought of you.

10:24.300 --> 10:26.300
Your hospice, I mean, Joys.

10:27.659 --> 10:29.517
Oh, we're actually full at the moment,

10:29.542 --> 10:31.293
but I can let you know
when we have an opening.

10:31.317 --> 10:32.456
Mary, please.

10:35.949 --> 10:37.849
I care about this woman a lot.

10:38.320 --> 10:39.630
She's like a mother to me.

10:39.859 --> 10:41.687
I told you, we don't have room.

10:41.712 --> 10:44.412
Please, just... come and meet her.

10:44.795 --> 10:47.128
I know you care about your
patients as much as I do.

10:47.153 --> 10:48.787
I know you're gonna want to help her.

10:49.945 --> 10:51.742
That's why I covered
for you with the cops.

10:54.235 --> 10:55.646
"Covered for me?"

10:55.682 --> 10:58.182
How I said I was with you the
whole time you were with Gail.

10:58.645 --> 11:00.981
I know the cops get weird
about that kind of stuff.

11:05.325 --> 11:07.991
- Your patient, where is she?
- Amazing!

11:08.027 --> 11:10.033
Thank you so much, Mary!

11:10.058 --> 11:12.299
Oh, is it okay if I call you Mary?

11:14.345 --> 11:16.225
I have a feeling you and
I are gonna be friends.

11:21.239 --> 11:22.763
Diamond Flush!

11:24.951 --> 11:26.952
Are you sure that's not
a horseshoe in your colon?

11:27.538 --> 11:28.583
If only.

11:30.800 --> 11:32.933
Bob. Can I have a word?

11:33.426 --> 11:37.067
Uh... actually, I prefer Robert.

11:38.339 --> 11:39.706
Never really felt like a Bob.

11:39.724 --> 11:42.525
Didn't think I could
pull it off, I guess.

11:42.561 --> 11:45.320
Okay. Robert, I need to speak with you.

11:45.345 --> 11:46.464
Uh-huh.

11:48.056 --> 11:49.833
Ahem. Privately.

11:51.265 --> 11:52.366
Rude.

11:53.381 --> 11:54.514
Your room?

12:03.316 --> 12:06.586
So, Robert, I've spoken with Dr. Harris.

12:06.611 --> 12:08.994
And we've decided that...

12:09.029 --> 12:10.705
today is your day.

12:12.266 --> 12:14.198
To pop your clogs, as they say.

12:14.549 --> 12:15.702
Oh...

12:17.087 --> 12:18.337
All right, then.

12:18.372 --> 12:21.736
Not the most... most
pleasant way to describe it,

12:21.761 --> 12:23.134
but I get the drift.

12:23.159 --> 12:25.692
Great. So, there's the medical part,

12:25.717 --> 12:28.472
pentobarbital injected into
a beverage of your choice,

12:28.497 --> 12:30.382
which is handled by Dr. Harris and...

12:30.418 --> 12:31.952
well, I handle the other parts.

12:33.654 --> 12:35.854
The... ceremonial parts:

12:36.660 --> 12:39.599
a last meal, a song to play you off

12:39.624 --> 12:42.727
into the great unknown, you
know, that sort of thing.

12:42.762 --> 12:45.763
Well, I... Goodness.

12:46.786 --> 12:48.033
I really don't...

12:51.678 --> 12:53.473
- Let me think.
- Well...

12:53.498 --> 12:56.864
- What kind of music do you like?
- Hmm? Oh, uh...

12:57.244 --> 12:59.450
Not really a fan.

12:59.475 --> 13:02.447
- Of music?
- Never really like the stuff.

13:02.482 --> 13:04.420
Last meal?

13:05.803 --> 13:07.352
Let's see...

13:07.387 --> 13:09.771
Oh, I've always loved...

13:10.662 --> 13:12.122
a hearty loaf of bread.

13:12.158 --> 13:14.697
- Come on, really?
- Right, no, no, no.

13:14.722 --> 13:16.689
No, no, bread sounds good.

13:16.714 --> 13:19.214
Bread is... Biblical.

13:21.450 --> 13:23.082
I'm not interrupting, am I?

13:23.107 --> 13:25.605
Well, we did leave
the common room for a reason.

13:26.081 --> 13:28.047
I thought maybe you
two were getting naked.

13:28.072 --> 13:31.507
- Nothing that exciting, I'm afraid.
- Actually, Lucy, I'm...

13:32.358 --> 13:33.960
I'm glad you're here.

13:34.766 --> 13:39.105
I'm trying to decide how to spend
my last moments on earth.

13:39.130 --> 13:41.463
I'm starting to think
that neither of you

13:41.488 --> 13:45.858
understand the notion of
a closed door conversation.

13:46.224 --> 13:48.091
We're all here for the same reason.

13:48.602 --> 13:49.926
Maybe she can help.

13:50.719 --> 13:54.062
Yeah. I think death planner
could have been my thing...

13:54.418 --> 13:56.172
if I ever had a thing besides dying.

13:56.496 --> 13:57.663
I've got it.

13:59.056 --> 14:00.356
A single candle...

14:01.172 --> 14:05.375
to extinguish upon my extinguishing.

14:05.411 --> 14:07.377
Oh, goodness! That...

14:08.115 --> 14:09.983
that sounds almost poetic.

14:10.008 --> 14:12.475
- Inspired, even.
- Ah.

14:14.920 --> 14:18.040
Are you sure... are you sure
I can't get you anything?

14:18.065 --> 14:19.506
Dottie, sit your ass down.

14:19.531 --> 14:22.663
You're 100 and dying. You
don't have to take care of us.

14:23.042 --> 14:26.214
I am 80!

14:26.239 --> 14:29.341
You call me 100 again,

14:29.366 --> 14:31.199
and I'll wash your
mouth out with bleach.

14:32.144 --> 14:34.169
- We should kill this old bitch.
- Oh, shut up!

14:34.204 --> 14:36.739
Seriously, though.

14:36.774 --> 14:39.341
That is what we are here to talk about.

14:39.532 --> 14:40.701
Death and such.

14:40.726 --> 14:43.868
Oh, well, that's all anyone wants
to talk to me about these days.

14:45.049 --> 14:46.916
Dr. Harris is going
to explain everything.

14:46.941 --> 14:49.809
Yes, Dorothy. I understand
you're terminal.

14:50.020 --> 14:53.545
- Oh, yes I am.
- How are you feeling?

14:53.763 --> 14:57.131
Like shit. Thank you for asking.

14:57.514 --> 14:59.951
Okay, well... that's why I'm here.

15:00.615 --> 15:03.065
I run a hospice called Joys.

15:04.004 --> 15:06.541
And Francis thought
you might be interested

15:06.566 --> 15:09.171
in hospice care as a possible option.

15:09.402 --> 15:11.469
What? No, no. We've talked about this.

15:11.494 --> 15:13.065
I don't want to spend my last days

15:13.090 --> 15:15.220
playing cards with a bunch of sad sacks.

15:16.080 --> 15:18.439
I'm sorry. I'm confused.

15:18.464 --> 15:20.543
Oh, no offense.

15:20.568 --> 15:23.535
I'm sure it's lovely.
I was just being honest.

15:23.696 --> 15:25.829
Not that anyone cares what I think.

15:25.854 --> 15:29.169
Especially not my son,
whose main concern is

15:29.194 --> 15:34.195
that I stay alive to make it
to his retirement party.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.499
Dorothy... right now,

15:40.957 --> 15:42.224
right this second,

15:43.615 --> 15:45.049
are you in pain?

15:46.447 --> 15:47.476
Oh...

15:49.587 --> 15:51.645
Then let us help you.

15:51.680 --> 15:53.907
Dr. Harris and I both believe

15:53.932 --> 15:57.033
that people should be able
to end their own suffering.

15:57.720 --> 15:59.253
And we can do that for you.

16:00.541 --> 16:03.208
Today.

16:06.644 --> 16:08.443
Hi, it's Mary. Leave a message.

16:08.468 --> 16:11.469
Hello, Mary. It's your
trusty partner, Des.

16:11.624 --> 16:14.024
I'm here with Robert.
Where the hell are you?

16:18.508 --> 16:19.859
Where is Dr. Harris?

16:19.884 --> 16:22.852
I can't seem to reach her. But it's okay.

16:22.877 --> 16:24.744
Right? I think we can do this.

16:24.779 --> 16:25.880
Here you go.

16:31.412 --> 16:33.018
Just need to get things ready for you.

16:34.846 --> 16:35.947
No.

16:37.186 --> 16:38.333
Excuse me?

16:38.358 --> 16:41.660
- No.
- I was a doctor once too, Bob.

16:44.268 --> 16:47.299
You asked me what I want

16:47.334 --> 16:49.354
when I die. Well, here it is.

16:49.596 --> 16:53.649
I want to be looking into
Dr. Harris's baby blues

16:53.852 --> 16:55.174
when I go.

16:55.423 --> 16:57.842
At least she calls me Robert.

17:04.218 --> 17:06.017
Are you offering to kill me?

17:06.053 --> 17:07.938
- Is that against the law?
- Yes.

17:07.963 --> 17:11.934
That's right. What Francis is
suggesting is still not legal here.

17:12.650 --> 17:14.040
Dorothy...

17:14.470 --> 17:16.569
You own this life.

17:16.595 --> 17:18.429
You made it what it is.

17:18.558 --> 17:20.422
No governing body did that for you.

17:21.196 --> 17:24.665
So, who are they to tell you
what you do with that life now?

17:25.290 --> 17:27.171
You deserve peace.

17:29.876 --> 17:31.942
Is that what you believe?

17:32.561 --> 17:36.348
Yes, it is, if that's what you want.

17:40.938 --> 17:42.407
No, it's not.

17:42.878 --> 17:43.944
No.

17:44.512 --> 17:46.083
I do hate those parties,

17:46.108 --> 17:49.560
but I love the rides home.

17:51.296 --> 17:53.363
When it's quiet and dark in the car

17:53.398 --> 17:56.423
and no one's speaking...

17:57.266 --> 17:59.383
I can just watch my sweet,

17:59.492 --> 18:02.854
tired little family
lost in their thoughts.

18:03.719 --> 18:05.685
I love those moments.

18:08.337 --> 18:10.103
I'm not ready to give them up yet.

18:13.390 --> 18:15.354
Well, then you live for those moments.

18:17.989 --> 18:20.990
What are you doing?
You gave her false hope!

18:21.026 --> 18:23.568
Dorothy is not going to
live for those moments.

18:23.593 --> 18:25.390
She's going to lie there in agony

18:25.415 --> 18:27.007
until she can't stand it anymore.

18:27.210 --> 18:29.382
Then, she is going to stay alive

18:29.407 --> 18:31.990
for a little bit longer,
and then she is going to die.

18:32.015 --> 18:33.420
She didn't want hospice care.

18:33.445 --> 18:34.906
I don't know what else you want from me!

18:34.930 --> 18:37.210
I want you to end her suffering.

18:38.309 --> 18:39.788
Like you did with Gail.

18:41.530 --> 18:42.620
Mary...

18:42.930 --> 18:44.433
I saw you do it.

18:45.854 --> 18:47.843
You used pentobarbital. Right?

18:48.102 --> 18:49.577
It was beautiful.

18:49.727 --> 18:53.786
One minute she was suffering,
and the next... it was over.

18:55.426 --> 18:57.525
I just wanted the
same thing for Dorothy.

18:58.325 --> 19:00.339
I don't know what you think you saw...

19:01.135 --> 19:02.908
but you're mistaken.

19:02.933 --> 19:04.033
Oh.

19:05.069 --> 19:07.403
Am I mistaken about Betty Lisko too?

19:09.083 --> 19:11.373
What does Betty Lisko
have to do with anything?

19:12.989 --> 19:15.512
When I saw you at Gail's,
you seemed familiar.

19:16.447 --> 19:17.582
Then it twigged.

19:18.536 --> 19:19.777
Eden General.

19:20.384 --> 19:22.818
I started there a little
while ago as a nurse.

19:23.017 --> 19:24.519
I haven't worked there in months.

19:24.544 --> 19:26.019
I know. You quit.

19:26.619 --> 19:28.552
And I totally get why.

19:29.158 --> 19:31.784
I can't stand by and
watch someone suffer.

19:32.325 --> 19:34.262
And obviously, you can't either.

19:35.732 --> 19:38.333
I know you helped Betty Lisko die.

19:38.753 --> 19:41.135
I know who you really are.

19:41.503 --> 19:42.769
No, you don't.

19:43.768 --> 19:46.430
Because if you did, you'd
know I would never help someone

19:46.463 --> 19:48.142
who wasn't ready to die.

20:09.408 --> 20:10.689
What happened with Robert?

20:11.158 --> 20:13.822
- He's still with us. Clearly.
- Why?

20:14.097 --> 20:15.924
Oh, we have a system.

20:16.296 --> 20:18.230
No, Mary does the deaths.

20:18.463 --> 20:23.585
She's the one with the bedside
manner who absorbs their pain and

20:23.610 --> 20:27.212
puts it in a little box to live
like a ticking time bomb inside her.

20:27.237 --> 20:28.618
It's how we've always operated.

20:28.866 --> 20:31.221
Okay. So then, where is Mary?

20:31.991 --> 20:33.490
Your guess is as good as mine.

20:33.858 --> 20:36.453
- She's not answering her phone.
- Well, something must be wrong.

20:36.478 --> 20:39.262
Mary wouldn't just leave. She
wouldn't just miss Robert's death.

20:39.297 --> 20:42.398
Mary, Mary, Mary. Everyone's
so concerned with Mary.

20:42.533 --> 20:46.188
Have we all forgotten, this
entire place was my idea?

20:46.213 --> 20:47.713
Robert didn't want you, did he?

20:49.627 --> 20:51.494
He wanted Mary, not you.

20:51.861 --> 20:53.109
He choked.

20:55.483 --> 20:57.583
He blew out his stupid candle.

20:59.760 --> 21:00.891
I'm gonna go find Mary.

21:08.460 --> 21:10.727
Is anybody home?

21:11.553 --> 21:13.096
Hey, babe.

21:16.247 --> 21:18.247
What are you doing in
here all alone and quiet?

21:18.272 --> 21:19.712
It's a little bit creepy.

21:20.576 --> 21:22.373
What do you think happens when you die?

21:25.276 --> 21:27.776
You're just... sitting in here,

21:28.074 --> 21:30.146
alone, thinking about death?

21:30.683 --> 21:33.616
- Any particular reason?
- Not really.

21:33.651 --> 21:36.224
It's just something that's
been on my mind lately.

21:36.249 --> 21:38.249
You really are your mother's daughter.

21:38.566 --> 21:40.299
- What?
- Nothing.

21:40.553 --> 21:41.821
What do you think happens?

21:44.345 --> 21:46.197
You get burned in a fire.

21:47.907 --> 21:49.400
You mean cremated?

21:50.131 --> 21:52.389
Yeah, sometimes that happens.

21:52.414 --> 21:54.225
But that's completely your choice.

21:54.250 --> 21:56.256
And that is just your body.
I mean, who you are,

21:56.281 --> 21:58.736
your spirit... that's long gone by then.

21:59.796 --> 22:01.148
Gone where though?

22:01.367 --> 22:03.267
Well, that's the big mystery. I mean...

22:03.890 --> 22:06.446
People believe lots of different things.

22:06.931 --> 22:09.064
It's kind of the basis for religion.

22:09.709 --> 22:11.506
So, Christians believe

22:11.904 --> 22:13.873
in heaven. I mean, you know that one.

22:15.764 --> 22:17.270
I was into Buddhism for a little while,

22:17.294 --> 22:19.261
and they believe that when you die,

22:19.818 --> 22:21.466
your spirit comes back to life

22:21.491 --> 22:24.002
but in a different physical form.

22:27.074 --> 22:28.874
What do you believe now?

22:30.307 --> 22:31.543
I...

22:35.196 --> 22:36.338
I don't know.

22:41.755 --> 22:45.015
So, she works at the hospital?

22:45.040 --> 22:46.356
Her name is Francis Thorp.

22:46.381 --> 22:48.842
I think she may be
in the home care unit.

22:49.431 --> 22:50.962
There's a Francis in the ICU.

22:50.987 --> 22:53.517
- She is new. Four months, maybe?
- Well, that must be her.

22:53.811 --> 22:55.595
But an ICU nurse visiting

22:55.620 --> 22:57.787
a patient at home? Is that normal?

22:57.812 --> 23:00.668
Well, I don't do that.
But I'm dead inside, so...

23:00.811 --> 23:04.191
Do you know a patient
named Dorothy Rosemond?

23:04.457 --> 23:05.847
Yeah, I know Dorothy.

23:06.183 --> 23:08.902
Pancreatic cancer,
definitely terminal. Why?

23:09.550 --> 23:11.628
I went to see her today with Francis.

23:12.714 --> 23:14.128
Francis showed up at Joys.

23:14.153 --> 23:15.977
It was the only way to
get her out of there.

23:16.002 --> 23:17.488
Please tell me you didn't do anything.

23:17.512 --> 23:19.878
Of course not! Annie! No.

23:20.988 --> 23:22.311
But Francis wanted me to.

23:23.974 --> 23:26.075
Annie, she saw me kill Gail.

23:28.225 --> 23:29.316
Shit.

23:37.534 --> 23:39.343
It's a beautiful spot.

23:41.926 --> 23:43.007
It is.

23:44.149 --> 23:45.383
I couldn't think of a...

23:45.962 --> 23:47.428
nicer place to die.

23:48.689 --> 23:50.878
What do you have, if
you don't mind me asking?

23:51.679 --> 23:52.779
Colon cancer.

23:53.700 --> 23:56.808
Very... undignified.

23:57.450 --> 24:00.913
- What about you?
- It's not for me.

24:01.525 --> 24:03.432
I'm checking the place
out for my mother.

24:03.457 --> 24:04.533
Oh, well...

24:04.962 --> 24:07.896
Glad for you, sorry for her.

24:09.704 --> 24:10.982
Do you like it here?

24:11.258 --> 24:13.975
I do. Very much.

24:15.311 --> 24:18.129
What about the staff, the
doctors. Do you like them?

24:18.507 --> 24:21.710
There's only one... real doctor here,

24:21.735 --> 24:23.725
but she's quite remarkable.

24:24.202 --> 24:25.600
Never met anyone like her.

24:26.172 --> 24:28.742
- Dr. Harris.
- You know her?

24:29.820 --> 24:31.075
Well, then...

24:31.257 --> 24:32.608
I don't have to tell you.

24:34.839 --> 24:36.238
I feel like...

24:36.263 --> 24:38.706
if I can choose to go with Dr. Harris

24:39.377 --> 24:41.178
beside me, holding my hand...

24:45.817 --> 24:48.739
Then, I think I might
be able to bear it.

25:02.356 --> 25:04.535
- Oh, my God.
- All right.

25:04.740 --> 25:07.241
What kind of shady business
are you running here, Bennett?

25:07.955 --> 25:10.315
I happened to notice that
Robert is still with us.

25:10.350 --> 25:11.939
Oh, does that inconvenience you?

25:11.964 --> 25:14.397
I'm so sorry about that. I do apologize.

25:15.596 --> 25:16.946
What's wrong?

25:16.971 --> 25:19.531
Oh, come on... Is it girl problems?

25:20.025 --> 25:22.493
Well, I don't understand

25:22.518 --> 25:26.126
why everyone is so obsessed
with bedside manner.

25:26.591 --> 25:27.943
Do you know what I went to school for?

25:27.967 --> 25:29.864
Medicine. Science.

25:29.889 --> 25:32.794
Do you know who goes to school to
learn how to coddle? Babysitters.

25:33.305 --> 25:35.312
Okay. Let it out.

25:35.739 --> 25:38.806
I mean, you don't go to school
for babysitting, but I get you.

25:38.951 --> 25:42.506
Everything right now
is about connecting.

25:42.531 --> 25:44.632
If you want to the measure
of a man, count his friends.

25:44.656 --> 25:46.146
- Blah, blah.
- Boring.

25:46.171 --> 25:49.599
Right? There are plenty of exceptionally

25:49.624 --> 25:52.116
contributing people with
problematic personalities.

25:52.618 --> 25:55.155
- Like you.
- Exactly. Wait. What?

25:57.233 --> 25:59.935
You think I have a... a
problematic personality?

26:00.915 --> 26:02.528
I thought that's what you were saying.

26:04.646 --> 26:06.178
I'm just trying to help people.

26:11.061 --> 26:13.581
If you are interested in
making dreams come true,

26:14.122 --> 26:15.392
I can help.

26:17.093 --> 26:19.226
- I made a bucket list.
- Oh, good God.

26:21.417 --> 26:24.386
Now, I've got the perfect
thing that we can do.

26:24.411 --> 26:26.378
Tonight. It's free.

26:26.978 --> 26:28.456
All we need are two bodies

26:28.987 --> 26:30.225
and an open mind.

26:32.893 --> 26:35.427
Jess?

26:37.480 --> 26:38.494
Hi.

26:38.519 --> 26:39.696
What are you doing here?

26:39.721 --> 26:40.815
Are you all right?

26:41.578 --> 26:43.401
Is the baby all right? Are you okay?

26:43.612 --> 26:45.378
Yeah, I'm fine. Why?

26:47.069 --> 26:50.053
Well, you disappeared today
and you didn't let anybody know.

26:50.603 --> 26:51.795
I wasn't feeling well.

26:52.835 --> 26:54.281
Where are the girls?

26:55.933 --> 26:57.652
I fed them,

26:57.824 --> 27:00.160
and I sent them to their
rooms to do their homework.

27:00.185 --> 27:02.990
You know, just... regular mom stuff.

27:03.662 --> 27:05.863
I really don't need this right now.

27:05.888 --> 27:07.455
It was Robert's day today.

27:07.908 --> 27:10.078
- And you didn't show.
- Oh, shit.

27:10.103 --> 27:12.178
And Robert wouldn't go
through with it without you.

27:12.663 --> 27:15.776
I'm sorry. I'll talk
to Robert. I'll explain.

27:15.801 --> 27:17.874
You do know the people
are depending on you?

27:17.899 --> 27:20.399
Me, Des, your patients.
Oh, and your kids.

27:20.424 --> 27:22.626
I said I was sorry, Nicole!

27:23.735 --> 27:25.701
I'm doing what I can here, all right?

27:25.905 --> 27:27.072
I'm working at Joys,

27:27.097 --> 27:29.478
I'm managing the girls on my own,

27:29.503 --> 27:32.018
I'm having a baby in four months

27:32.054 --> 27:34.702
- by myself.
- Whose choice was that?

27:35.966 --> 27:37.077
What?

27:37.374 --> 27:39.032
You think you handle
everything on your own

27:39.056 --> 27:41.616
because that's just how you roll.
You've always rolled like that.

27:42.158 --> 27:43.211
Mary knows best.

27:43.236 --> 27:44.650
Mary decides things.

27:46.001 --> 27:47.659
Do you ever just stop to
think about all the people

27:47.683 --> 27:49.184
that you're hurting along the way?

27:53.558 --> 27:55.081
- Ready? Okay.
- Yeah.

27:56.958 --> 27:58.197
- And...
- Come on!

27:59.101 --> 28:00.166
Okay.

28:00.915 --> 28:03.048
Oh!

28:04.885 --> 28:08.387
Are you okay?

28:08.735 --> 28:10.205
It was supposed be my face!

28:10.230 --> 28:11.463
I tried. I missed.

28:19.630 --> 28:23.532
- I can't... What?
- Are you okay?

28:23.614 --> 28:24.843
What?

28:30.785 --> 28:32.801
It's the first time I punch someone...

28:33.564 --> 28:36.465
and then I'm the one
who bleeds! Oh, my God!

28:38.448 --> 28:39.903
I can't!

28:40.988 --> 28:43.588
- What is this?
- Oh, it's clean, I swear!

28:45.425 --> 28:47.759
Oh... God.

29:12.085 --> 29:13.160
Ben.

29:14.558 --> 29:15.698
What are you doing here?

29:16.746 --> 29:17.964
We need to talk.

29:38.151 --> 29:39.647
How did you find out?

29:40.679 --> 29:41.976
It doesn't matter.

29:48.895 --> 29:50.013
Is it mine?

29:52.993 --> 29:54.027
Yeah.

29:59.614 --> 30:01.227
Were you ever gonna tell me?

30:02.736 --> 30:04.479
I didn't know what
you'd think. I figured

30:04.504 --> 30:06.386
after the way we left things, you...

30:07.645 --> 30:10.472
- you would never want to see me again.
- Don't put this on me.

30:10.589 --> 30:13.009
It isn't about what I want.
Obviously, it's about you.

30:13.034 --> 30:15.493
That's not fair. You made
it clear how you felt.

30:15.518 --> 30:18.001
No, I made it clear I was doing my job.

30:21.173 --> 30:23.106
You really think you
got this all figured out,

30:23.131 --> 30:24.328
don't you, Mary?

30:25.702 --> 30:28.273
What's best for me, what's
best for that baby...

30:29.820 --> 30:32.179
Especially what's best
for your patients, right?

30:32.890 --> 30:33.976
What does that mean?

30:34.858 --> 30:37.789
Joys... your whole new operation.

30:42.201 --> 30:44.071
I don't know what you're talking about.

30:44.096 --> 30:46.230
Stop, Mary! Please, can you just...

30:46.255 --> 30:48.221
just stop lying. Can you do that?

30:48.246 --> 30:50.135
Can you just stop investigating me?

30:50.160 --> 30:51.995
Christ. You know what?

30:52.020 --> 30:54.053
It's not me you gotta
worry about anymore.

30:55.073 --> 30:57.509
I'm done, Mary. I'm
out. I'm off the force.

30:58.064 --> 30:59.650
But there's this new detective,

30:59.675 --> 31:01.675
and he's smart. He's eager.

31:01.910 --> 31:05.115
And he knows about
you. About the hospice.

31:05.140 --> 31:08.474
Are you threatening me or
are you trying to protect me?

31:08.499 --> 31:11.091
Honestly? I don't even know anymore.

31:18.633 --> 31:19.741
Why?

31:21.500 --> 31:23.513
Why did you decide to keep it?

31:28.016 --> 31:29.543
Because it's yours.

31:44.958 --> 31:46.458
Robert.

31:51.979 --> 31:53.049
Robert?

31:54.871 --> 31:55.949
Robert?

31:57.199 --> 31:58.363
You out here?

32:06.549 --> 32:07.682
Robert?

32:15.003 --> 32:16.157
Robert?

32:18.112 --> 32:21.034
Lucy? What are you doing here?

32:22.253 --> 32:23.596
- Um... I...
- You haven't

32:23.632 --> 32:25.991
seen Robert, have you? He's
not his room and he's...

32:26.451 --> 32:27.686
No...

32:35.933 --> 32:37.310
Nicole!

32:39.908 --> 32:42.761
- Nicole!
- Robert!

32:42.786 --> 32:43.981
- Listen! I...
- What?!

32:44.006 --> 32:45.801
Because unless you tell
me you're a sleepwalker,

32:45.825 --> 32:47.440
there's really nothing you can say.

32:47.823 --> 32:50.634
Sleeping with a patient! Do
you know how pathetic that is?

32:50.659 --> 32:53.431
She is vulnerable and stuck
here and you're the only man

32:53.456 --> 32:55.227
around here without open sores.

32:55.263 --> 32:57.630
That's a real conquest there, Des.

32:57.666 --> 32:59.249
- Robert!
- No, you don't understand!

32:59.274 --> 33:00.390
It's not like that!

33:18.172 --> 33:20.022
Just... just call Mary again.

33:20.047 --> 33:21.354
Okay? Just...

33:21.586 --> 33:23.828
Why is she not answering her phone?

33:25.918 --> 33:27.017
Hi.

33:31.154 --> 33:33.455
- What's going on?
- Robert's dead.

33:34.350 --> 33:37.669
He froze to death. So yeah,
that's what's going on.

33:38.989 --> 33:40.872
Oh, my God...

33:41.559 --> 33:43.093
You need to sign off on this.

33:44.395 --> 33:45.474
I can't.

33:46.763 --> 33:49.214
He didn't die from his
disease. I can't sign off on it.

33:49.239 --> 33:51.716
We have to call the coroner.
We're all gonna to go to jail!

33:52.044 --> 33:54.620
- I'm going to go to jail.
- He had terminal agitation.

33:54.914 --> 33:56.695
Nicole, calm down. We'll figure it out.

33:56.720 --> 33:58.206
Oh, are you gonna to be
there for that to happen,

33:58.230 --> 33:59.293
or you just are you just gonna take off

33:59.317 --> 34:02.346
and hope no more patients wander
into the woods and die alone?

34:02.371 --> 34:04.860
Yeah, All right! Let's just
all take a breath, all right?

34:04.885 --> 34:08.156
Oh... Des, hi. Are you
the voice of reason right now?

34:08.429 --> 34:11.781
Where was all that reason when you
decided to sleep with a patient?

34:18.447 --> 34:19.549
Lucy.

34:22.688 --> 34:23.882
How did that even happen?

34:24.315 --> 34:26.594
Says the woman who's
having a baby with a man

34:26.620 --> 34:28.632
she slept with when she
thought he was a patient.

34:28.657 --> 34:31.221
Okay. Not judging.

34:35.149 --> 34:37.360
We've really made a mess
of things, haven't we?

34:39.665 --> 34:41.639
Last one to the kitchen
has to start dinner!

34:41.665 --> 34:43.001
You're the worst!

34:45.638 --> 34:47.905
Hey!

34:51.577 --> 34:52.710
Jess!

34:58.818 --> 35:01.785
Shit. Shit! Naomi!

35:01.810 --> 35:02.887
Naomi, okay!

35:09.677 --> 35:11.628
Without you, Jess...

35:12.317 --> 35:14.697
- Whoa... okay...
- ... I don't have anybody.

35:14.733 --> 35:15.976
What are you doing?
What are you talking about?

35:16.000 --> 35:17.193
You can't just ignore me.

35:17.218 --> 35:19.680
Jess, I swear to God, I will
fling myself off his balcony.

35:19.704 --> 35:22.439
Wait! Don't, don't! Stop,
stop, stop! No! Get down!

35:24.776 --> 35:27.276
Oh, my God! You should've
seen the look on your face.

35:27.312 --> 35:28.856
- That's not funny.
- I'm sorry. Was it too much?

35:28.880 --> 35:30.780
- Yes.
- Okay. Jess, I'm sorry.

35:30.816 --> 35:33.447
- No!
- Okay, Jess. Jess, I'm sorry.

35:33.472 --> 35:35.151
Jess, I'm...

35:35.186 --> 35:36.319
It's just...

35:38.856 --> 35:40.123
I really missed you.

35:43.032 --> 35:44.637
We're still friends, okay?

35:44.662 --> 35:46.829
You've gotta stop this.
You've gotta stop being crazy!

35:46.864 --> 35:49.832
I can try.

36:05.430 --> 36:06.915
You know, I...

36:07.594 --> 36:08.751
I really am sorry...

36:10.141 --> 36:11.276
about Robert.

36:14.491 --> 36:17.257
He didn't want... anything.

36:18.928 --> 36:20.429
Except not to be alone.

36:32.050 --> 36:33.808
Well, none of us really do.

36:54.064 --> 36:55.875
Cambie, can you set the table, please?

36:59.571 --> 37:00.725
Naomi.

37:00.750 --> 37:03.269
Hiya, Dr. Harris. Did you miss me?

37:06.575 --> 37:08.942
I didn't realize you two
were hanging out again.

37:08.977 --> 37:10.911
Um, can Naomi stay for dinner?

37:12.140 --> 37:13.607
Her mom's been away on a case.

37:13.632 --> 37:16.039
- So...
- I love pasta.

37:18.894 --> 37:22.655
Okay. Cambie, set for one more.

37:23.832 --> 37:24.881
Mom...

37:27.728 --> 37:30.263
Get upstairs. Go.

37:30.298 --> 37:31.487
Now!

37:59.192 --> 38:00.503
Mary Harris?

38:01.021 --> 38:03.780
- Yes.
- I'm here about your daughter.

38:08.131 --> 38:10.651
You set Heather's car on fire!

38:10.675 --> 38:12.050
Mom. Mom, I'm so sorry!

38:12.058 --> 38:14.589
What the hell were you thinking,
pulling a stunt like that?

38:14.605 --> 38:16.650
Mom, it was a stupid, it was a prank.

38:16.675 --> 38:18.578
A stupid, reckless thing to do!

38:20.163 --> 38:22.362
You're lucky Heather
isn't pressing charges.

38:22.773 --> 38:24.420
And you're gonna pay back every cent

38:24.445 --> 38:26.132
it's costing me to fix her car.

38:26.157 --> 38:29.652
It wasn't her fault. It
was a complete accident.

38:29.677 --> 38:31.958
And I swear, Dr. Harris...

38:31.983 --> 38:34.076
You two are hanging out
again and this happens?

38:35.058 --> 38:37.125
Naomi, go home.

38:37.886 --> 38:39.019
Now!

38:45.662 --> 38:48.512
You're grounded. And I
don't want to see that girl

38:48.537 --> 38:50.504
in my house ever again!

38:50.539 --> 38:52.608
It's not her fault!
Okay? Heather dumped me

38:52.633 --> 38:54.515
because of what you do
for a living, and she was

38:54.540 --> 38:56.381
just trying to have
a little bit of fun...

38:56.406 --> 38:59.789
Don't try to turn this around,
Jess! This isn't about me.

38:59.814 --> 39:02.383
This is all you. These
are the choices you made!

39:14.283 --> 39:15.617
Mom?

39:20.124 --> 39:21.291
Oh, my God...

39:28.115 --> 39:29.410
Don't be like me.

39:30.245 --> 39:32.112
Okay? Whatever you do,

39:32.147 --> 39:33.524
just don't be like me.

39:35.680 --> 39:36.884
I don't understand.

39:38.564 --> 39:40.787
I thought they were here for me, Jess.

40:06.548 --> 40:08.315
Hey. Want a smoke?

40:08.678 --> 40:11.037
No, I'm good. I'm good, I'm good.

40:11.062 --> 40:12.462
I never really had a taste for it.

40:13.822 --> 40:18.018
So... I checked out the hospice.

40:18.360 --> 40:21.361
Oh, yeah? Did you go inside or what?

40:21.396 --> 40:23.396
I walked around the property.

40:23.431 --> 40:26.165
Spoke to a patient. Asked about Mary.

40:26.200 --> 40:28.957
- And, okay?
- And it's legit, man.

40:30.059 --> 40:31.293
What do you mean?

40:31.675 --> 40:34.775
- Like, are you sure?
- Yeah. This guy I spoke to,

40:34.800 --> 40:36.377
- man, he was a talker.
- Mm-hmm.

40:36.402 --> 40:38.682
Trust me. If he was there to
be killed, he would've said.

40:39.549 --> 40:41.558
But what if he was lying to
you, like trying to protect her?

40:41.582 --> 40:43.583
Oh, come on, man. I've
been doing this a long time.

40:43.696 --> 40:45.980
I know when someone's lying
and this guy, he wasn't.

40:47.028 --> 40:48.856
I'm sorry, man, but there's nothing.

40:50.606 --> 40:51.690
Hmm.

40:54.358 --> 40:55.507
Shit!

40:57.164 --> 40:59.299
You know, I thought I had
myself a serial killer.

41:36.680 --> 41:38.843
I just couldn't handle
the idea of you alone

41:38.868 --> 41:41.155
after yesterday. I felt awful.

41:41.460 --> 41:42.673
Thank you.

41:42.708 --> 41:46.610
Believe me, I had no idea
it would go like that.

41:49.223 --> 41:50.402
Mm.

41:50.957 --> 41:54.854
I'm fine. It was just an odd
conversation to have, that's all.

41:58.624 --> 42:00.724
But I found it rather illuminating...

42:05.142 --> 42:06.392
Like I said,

42:07.970 --> 42:09.749
Mary and I both believe

42:09.774 --> 42:12.421
that people shouldn't have
to suffer 'til the end.

42:14.514 --> 42:16.314
And I stand by that.

42:23.962 --> 42:25.529
But the truth is...

42:27.652 --> 42:29.015
And this...

42:30.890 --> 42:33.623
comes from years, Dorothy.

42:35.206 --> 42:36.370
Years...

42:37.696 --> 42:39.143
of experience.

42:40.292 --> 42:43.612
People get far too sentimental
when it comes to death.

42:46.709 --> 42:48.429
They don't always know
what's best for them.

43:00.585 --> 43:03.387
But that's what I'm here for.
