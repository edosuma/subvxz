Valerie.

05:02.385 --> 05:03.085
I'm home.

05:04.221 --> 05:08.154
You're not supposed to
see me in this
before the wedding.

05:08.391 --> 05:09.324
It's bad luck.

05:09.993 --> 05:11.393
Don't worry about it.

05:11.995 --> 05:13.262
I mean, sweetheart,

05:13.731 --> 05:16.598
it's just some stupid
superstition anyway.

05:18.035 --> 05:19.245
Yeah, you're right.

05:19.269 --> 05:21.002
We met
on Friday the 13th

05:21.872 --> 05:23.672
and look
how happy we are.

05:24.708 --> 05:26.953
Ted, what happened?
You said 11:00.

05:26.977 --> 05:29.644
Sorry, Val. It was
blood and guts night

05:29.980 --> 05:31.780
at the old
emergency room.

05:32.983 --> 05:33.683
Again?

05:36.086 --> 05:37.686
I wish
you'd called me.

05:37.988 --> 05:39.855
I would have but,
you know,

05:40.123 --> 05:42.590
five minutes
on the phone could, uh,

05:43.393 --> 05:44.193
cost a life.

05:44.728 --> 05:45.428
Oh.

05:48.098 --> 05:49.231
I'm ready, Teddy.

05:51.735 --> 05:52.735
Oh, what a day.

05:55.739 --> 05:56.439
Oh, boy.

06:02.746 --> 06:04.546
I was fluffing it
for you.

06:16.059 --> 06:18.259
Could you get
the light, please?

06:28.105 --> 06:28.805
Teddy...

06:29.707 --> 06:30.907
look what I found.

06:32.075 --> 06:33.608
Sweetheart,
I'm sorry.

06:33.711 --> 06:35.978
I have to take out
a gall bladder

06:36.479 --> 06:38.346
first thing
in the morning.

06:38.716 --> 06:40.459
Tomorrow night.
I promise.

06:40.483 --> 06:43.350
I won't be here.
I'll be at the nail expo.

06:44.487 --> 06:46.700
The cuticle convention,
remember?

06:46.724 --> 06:48.457
I'll be gone
till Monday.

06:48.491 --> 06:50.558
Well, Monday, then.
I promise.

06:54.064 --> 06:56.664
I was reading an ad
for these pyramids

06:57.067 --> 06:58.467
you put over the bed.

06:59.069 --> 07:01.480
They're supposed to
increase sexual energy.

07:01.504 --> 07:02.571
Valerie, please.

07:03.473 --> 07:05.073
Good night,
sweetheart.

07:06.443 --> 07:07.143
'Night.

07:15.118 --> 07:17.030
K-Earth 101
southland weather--

07:17.054 --> 07:18.987
Another gorgeous day
in L.A.

07:19.056 --> 07:21.589
Sunny and warm.
86 degrees in Malibu.

07:21.925 --> 07:24.258
94 in the valley.
88 in Hollywood.

07:24.928 --> 07:28.061
That's K-Earth 101 news.
I'm Claudia Marshall.

07:28.465 --> 07:31.132
* It's the summer of love,
love, love *

07:32.269 --> 07:34.802
* I'm in love
with love, love, love *

07:35.338 --> 07:37.471
* For everyone
transcends who *

07:39.877 --> 07:41.277
* I'm thinking of you

07:42.545 --> 07:43.245
* Boy

07:44.414 --> 07:45.281
* Love energy

07:46.283 --> 07:47.750
* Is giving us a shove

07:49.019 --> 07:51.419
* Making this
the summer of love **

07:54.357 --> 07:55.290
Hi, Miss Lana.

07:55.926 --> 07:56.793
I'm so sorry.

07:57.360 --> 07:59.093
I missed
our appointment.

07:59.362 --> 08:00.562
You look so great.

08:01.331 --> 08:02.864
That's
a great outfit.

08:03.333 --> 08:06.066
Thanks, dear.
That door is a real bitch.

08:06.436 --> 08:07.136
Hi, Val.

08:07.905 --> 08:08.772
Good morning.

08:09.306 --> 08:11.506
It's a really
good color for me.

08:12.275 --> 08:12.975
Wow.

08:13.877 --> 08:14.944
You need a fill.

08:16.880 --> 08:18.013
Uh, morning, all.

08:18.281 --> 08:19.148
Good morning.

08:19.883 --> 08:23.416
You better have a note
from your mother, young lady.

08:23.921 --> 08:26.188
* He's showing off
his body... **

08:26.289 --> 08:27.156
I don't know.

08:27.891 --> 08:30.758
I'm just not that
turned on by her lately.

08:30.894 --> 08:33.427
I hear
oysters are good
for potency.

08:33.897 --> 08:34.764
I tried that,

08:35.899 --> 08:37.376
but they
kept slipping off.

08:37.400 --> 08:40.400
If I was any more potent,
I'd kill somebody.

08:40.938 --> 08:42.071
Whoa!
Oh, right!

08:42.304 --> 08:44.305
I gave this cute
little nurse

08:44.908 --> 08:46.841
a ride home
the other night.

08:47.344 --> 08:48.044
And?
And?

08:49.179 --> 08:52.025
And nothing.
I'm getting married
next month.

08:52.049 --> 08:53.782
And why are you
so tardy?

08:54.284 --> 08:56.951
I was up real late
last night with Ted.

08:57.888 --> 09:00.266
Dr. Dolittle
finally came through, huh?

09:00.290 --> 09:02.157
No. He was
dead on arrival.

09:02.893 --> 09:04.226
Again? Sanka?
Sure.

09:05.628 --> 09:07.961
At the rate we've
been having sex,

09:08.631 --> 09:11.098
we might as well
be married already.

09:11.634 --> 09:13.301
It's been,
like, a week?

09:13.871 --> 09:14.571
Two weeks.

09:16.073 --> 09:18.873
Valerie, Ted's obviously
a victim of PMS.

09:20.210 --> 09:21.877
What?
Premarital stress.

09:23.213 --> 09:25.346
Oh. What'll
snap him out of it?

09:25.883 --> 09:26.683
A new woman.

09:27.250 --> 09:27.950
Thanks.

09:28.886 --> 09:29.953
Wait. That's it!

09:30.287 --> 09:32.154
We'll make you
a new woman.

09:33.390 --> 09:35.190
This is great.
Watch this.

09:35.558 --> 09:38.371
Let's see how you look
on the makeover machine.

09:38.395 --> 09:39.995
Oh, housewife from hell.

09:41.431 --> 09:42.498
Matron on drugs.

09:43.533 --> 09:44.400
Look at that.

09:45.302 --> 09:47.502
That's it.
We'll make you blonde

09:48.171 --> 09:49.171
with blue eyes.

09:49.306 --> 09:51.906
Maybe
when I get back
from the expo--

09:52.409 --> 09:55.209
Skip the expo.
Stay home
and ambush Ted.

09:55.645 --> 09:57.512
What if
he doesn't like it?

09:58.281 --> 10:01.081
At this point,
what have you got to lose?

10:02.585 --> 10:04.785
Come on. We're
doing a makeover.

10:04.955 --> 10:05.655
Ooh! Ooh!

10:08.091 --> 10:10.091
Oh! Oh!
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Come on!

10:10.460 --> 10:11.160
A perm.

10:11.929 --> 10:12.629
A perm.

10:13.030 --> 10:13.730
A butch.

10:15.198 --> 10:15.898
A facial.

10:17.034 --> 10:17.834
A body wrap.

10:19.136 --> 10:20.003
Gravel scrub.

10:20.170 --> 10:21.170
A gravel scrub.

10:22.172 --> 10:22.905
Bikini wax.

10:24.074 --> 10:25.141
We'll do it all.

10:25.675 --> 10:26.375
All right!

10:37.587 --> 10:40.934
* It's time to face the music,
it's time to make you see *

10:40.958 --> 10:45.171
* The root of all your problems
is that you don't look like me *

10:45.195 --> 10:48.795
* Now this is gonna hurt you,
but I just got to say *

10:49.466 --> 10:53.866
* Your love life's going nowhere
'cause you look like Doris Day *

10:54.204 --> 10:55.448

they can't resist? *

10:55.472 --> 10:56.805

11:01.444 --> 11:03.244
* Honey,
if you vixenize *

11:04.314 --> 11:06.292
* Guaranteed
he'll get a rise *

11:06.316 --> 11:08.427
* Believe me, you can be
a brand new *

11:08.451 --> 11:09.184
* Brand new

11:09.686 --> 11:10.419

and fresh and wholesome *

11:27.470 --> 11:29.070
* But science has a cure

11:29.506 --> 11:31.639
* The natural look
is nowhere *

11:32.075 --> 11:33.719
* Your hairdresser
knows for sure *

11:33.743 --> 11:35.621
* You got to learn
the art of teasing *

11:35.645 --> 11:37.245
* Change your repertoire

11:38.115 --> 11:40.293
* All you need's
a little faith *

11:40.317 --> 11:42.517
* And a see-through
pushup bra *

11:46.289 --> 11:48.401

she might be right *

11:52.329 --> 11:54.673

Hello, Dr. Gallagher.

12:43.213 --> 12:43.913
Surprised?

12:45.182 --> 12:46.049
Yes, it's me.

12:49.586 --> 12:51.519
Oh! Tsk. Tsk.
Dr. Gallagher.

12:52.589 --> 12:55.056
Why are you
looking at me like that?

12:57.594 --> 12:58.927
You want to do what?

12:59.596 --> 13:01.196
Oh, no, no.
I couldn't.

13:03.166 --> 13:03.866
No.

13:04.567 --> 13:05.700
No, please. Stop.

13:06.503 --> 13:07.203
No, no.

13:08.105 --> 13:08.805
Well...

13:10.140 --> 13:10.840
all right.

13:14.111 --> 13:14.811
OK.

13:15.545 --> 13:16.245
Let's see.

13:18.115 --> 13:19.782
Now, champagne,
flowers,

13:22.385 --> 13:23.452
sushi, feathers,

13:24.387 --> 13:25.454
um, sensual oil,

13:27.157 --> 13:27.857
right,

13:28.525 --> 13:30.458
and incense or...
let's see.

13:52.449 --> 13:53.149
Oh, no!

13:57.654 --> 13:58.921
Oh, God. He's here.

14:15.505 --> 14:17.438
Well, this is
where we live.

14:18.508 --> 14:19.208
We?

14:19.909 --> 14:21.176
Yeah. Uh, you know,

14:21.911 --> 14:23.844
me and, uh,
the cat-- Bambi.

14:29.752 --> 14:31.619
Just make yourself

15:06.823 --> 15:07.523
Aah!

15:07.857 --> 15:09.324
Eat me,
I'm a cookie!

15:11.761 --> 15:13.739
I'm sorry.
I'm so embarrassed.

15:13.763 --> 15:15.830
I didn't know
Ted had company.

15:16.399 --> 15:17.199
I'm Valerie.

15:17.800 --> 15:20.000
I don't usually
dress like this.

15:20.403 --> 15:21.736
Here comes Dr. Love.

15:24.374 --> 15:26.241
All right, Robin,
a pileup.

15:27.810 --> 15:29.010
Who's your friend?

15:29.979 --> 15:30.679
Shit! Val.

15:32.382 --> 15:34.049
Ted, what
are you doing?

15:34.384 --> 15:35.517
Uh, gee, nothing.

15:36.353 --> 15:38.086
Wh-What is
going on here?

15:38.721 --> 15:40.633
You brought her home
to have sex?

15:40.657 --> 15:42.701
You weren't
supposed to be here.

15:42.725 --> 15:45.325
You were going to
have sex without me?

15:45.695 --> 15:46.628
Of course not.

15:47.264 --> 15:49.864
I don't know
what you two had in mind,

15:50.633 --> 15:52.700
but I'm not
into kinky scenes.

15:53.270 --> 15:53.970
Bye.

15:54.671 --> 15:56.004
You look incredible.

15:56.038 --> 15:58.638
Honey, she doesn't
mean a thing to me.

15:59.376 --> 16:01.843
If meaningless sex
is what you want,

16:01.944 --> 16:03.756
why can't you
have it with me!

16:03.780 --> 16:05.447
I made
a stupid mistake.

16:06.283 --> 16:08.616
I wanted a last fling,
that's all.

16:09.419 --> 16:12.030
You can't expect me
to be more evolved.

16:12.054 --> 16:14.187
Evolved? I'll show
you evolved.

16:14.857 --> 16:17.457
Wait a minute.
No. Now, don't do that.

16:18.295 --> 16:19.705
That's very dangerous.

16:19.729 --> 16:21.129
Cut it--Val, stop it!

16:21.698 --> 16:22.431
Cut it out!

16:23.032 --> 16:23.899
Val, come on!

16:26.836 --> 16:28.703
The neighbors
are watching!

16:30.840 --> 16:31.707
Val, open up.

16:31.774 --> 16:33.574
Sweetheart,
open the door!

16:34.444 --> 16:36.689
You're wanted
in emergency,
Dr. Love.

16:36.713 --> 16:39.313
You can't do this to me!
I'm a doctor!

16:41.751 --> 16:44.218
Here! Take these
with you, Dr. Love.

16:47.524 --> 16:48.857
And don't come back!

16:57.567 --> 16:58.267
Ted!

17:01.804 --> 17:02.504
Ted!

17:03.806 --> 17:05.539
Ted,
where are you going?

17:13.450 --> 17:14.983
Go to bed, Mrs. Merkin!

17:15.685 --> 17:17.417
Mrs. Merkin!
Mrs. Merkin!

17:21.758 --> 17:24.558
* You're a liar,
and it took me forever *

17:25.662 --> 17:26.994
* To figure that out

17:31.468 --> 17:33.346
* You could
switch on a smile *

17:33.370 --> 17:34.837
* Pretend to be tender

17:36.473 --> 17:39.206
* But I know now
what you're all about *

17:40.142 --> 17:41.342
* What a nightmare

17:42.412 --> 17:45.079
* My friends thought
you were a dream *

17:49.118 --> 17:51.251
* You could
switch on a smile *

17:52.889 --> 17:54.289
* And seem so sincere

17:55.492 --> 17:58.425
* But you don't even know
what that means *

17:58.995 --> 18:01.728
* I don't think
you'll ever understand *

18:03.400 --> 18:07.000
* Ooh, did cheating on me
make you feel like a man? *

18:08.505 --> 18:11.505
* I used to worship
the ground you walk on *

18:13.142 --> 18:15.542
* I did anything
you wanted me to *

18:16.946 --> 18:19.946
* I used to worship
the ground you walk on *

18:22.051 --> 18:24.318
* Now I've lost my faith
in you *

18:31.894 --> 18:32.594
* Aah

18:35.698 --> 18:37.831
* Sunday mornings
I'd wake up *

18:38.435 --> 18:40.702
* Lie in bed
watching you sleep *

18:44.774 --> 18:46.441
* It was almost religious

18:47.677 --> 18:49.210
* How I believed in you

18:50.212 --> 18:52.945
* It hurt when you
destroyed my belief *

18:54.584 --> 18:57.317
* I don't think
you'll ever understand *

18:58.788 --> 19:02.388
* Ooh, did cheatin' on me
make you feel like a man? *

19:03.760 --> 19:06.760
* I used to worship
the ground you walk on *

19:07.630 --> 19:10.030
* I did anything
you wanted me to *

19:11.901 --> 19:14.901
* I used to worship
the ground you walk on *

19:17.707 --> 19:19.974
* Now I've lost my faith
in you *

19:21.911 --> 19:24.178
* Oh, I've lost
my faith in you *

19:37.026 --> 19:40.026
* I used to worship
the ground you walk on *

19:41.831 --> 19:44.498
* Didn't think
I'd get by without you *

19:46.168 --> 19:49.301
* Now I don't worship
the ground you walk on *

19:51.173 --> 19:53.373
* And I'm stronger
than I knew *

19:55.978 --> 19:58.111
* I'm stronger
than you knew **

20:08.224 --> 20:09.224
Come here, you.

20:09.792 --> 20:12.004
No, Doctor.
What about your wife?

20:12.028 --> 20:13.961
She's in a coma.
You're not.

20:14.964 --> 20:15.664
No. Oh.

20:17.900 --> 20:18.600
Mmm. Oh.

20:21.070 --> 20:21.870
John?
John?

20:23.239 --> 20:23.939
Uh! Oh.

20:26.709 --> 20:27.776
You weasel dick!

20:31.781 --> 20:32.981
Hello.
Oh, Candy,

20:34.651 --> 20:37.251
the worst thing
in the world happened.

20:37.654 --> 20:38.787
No, Bambi's fine.

20:40.056 --> 20:40.756
It's Ted.

20:41.658 --> 20:44.125
Yeah. The blonde thing
did not work.

20:44.661 --> 20:47.461
It's the show that shows
the ins and outs

20:48.197 --> 20:50.997
of the southern California
fitness craze.

20:51.167 --> 20:54.034
Let's face it.
Inner beauty is for losers.

21:32.241 --> 21:32.941
Ooh.

22:23.125 --> 22:24.125
Ha ha ha ha ha!

22:26.295 --> 22:26.995
Uh!

22:44.346 --> 22:45.046
Whoa!

22:49.752 --> 22:50.452
Mac!

22:57.694 --> 22:58.494
Whoa!
Whoa!

23:44.874 --> 23:45.574
Aah!

23:53.750 --> 23:54.450
Oh, great.

23:58.287 --> 23:59.687
Oh, this is too good.

24:00.289 --> 24:02.889
There's a giant blow dryer
in my pool.

24:12.769 --> 24:13.469
Oh, shit!

24:15.237 --> 24:17.970
Ted, you're not going to
control my mind

24:18.908 --> 24:20.308
when you're not here.

24:20.910 --> 24:23.910
OK, just release
all of this negative energy

24:23.946 --> 24:25.413
out into the universe.

24:25.948 --> 24:28.881
You're just going to
swim right through it.

25:32.314 --> 25:33.314
Oh, Teddy bear,

25:34.884 --> 25:35.684
you're back.

25:40.289 --> 25:40.989
Aah!

25:42.524 --> 25:43.224
Aah!
Aah!

25:44.894 --> 25:45.961
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!

25:46.462 --> 25:47.329
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!

25:48.297 --> 25:50.364
What is this?
What's going on?

25:52.902 --> 25:55.113
This isn't
what it looks like, is it?

25:55.137 --> 25:56.204
Is it?
Zis zit?

25:57.273 --> 25:58.473
Oh, my God, it is.

25:59.909 --> 26:01.042
It's a spaceship.

26:01.310 --> 26:03.710
Oh, like things
weren't bad enough,

26:03.913 --> 26:06.113
now I've been abducted
by a UFO.

26:06.648 --> 26:09.781
You're just going to
do some experiments on me

26:10.286 --> 26:13.619
and let me go like in
the National Enquire Right?

26:14.056 --> 26:15.523
Right?
Right?
Right?

26:19.461 --> 26:20.161
OK. OK.

26:21.230 --> 26:24.297
Just don't take out
anything I'll need later.

26:29.571 --> 26:31.704
Get it over with
and let me go.

26:36.178 --> 26:38.423
I don't why
you abducted me anyway.

26:38.447 --> 26:40.959
I'm sure you're looking for
somebody more important

26:40.983 --> 26:42.183
like Nancy Reagan.

26:43.519 --> 26:45.652
I'll tell you
where to find her

26:46.288 --> 26:48.355
because
I'm just a manicurist.

26:48.657 --> 26:51.457
I don't know about anything
except nails.

26:52.028 --> 26:53.095
You know, nails.

26:53.195 --> 26:54.662
Nails.
Nails.
Nails.

26:59.468 --> 27:01.479
Really. I could
keep my mouth shut.

27:01.503 --> 27:04.436
You could tell me anything.
I'd never tell.

27:04.706 --> 27:05.639
Ask my cousin.

27:06.708 --> 27:09.975
She got her boobs done,
and I never told anyone.

27:10.579 --> 27:12.112
Except I just told you.

27:16.352 --> 27:18.152
Oh, my God.
You're aliens.

27:19.488 --> 27:20.188
Ooh!
Ooh!

27:23.125 --> 27:23.825
Ooh!

27:25.227 --> 27:25.927
Zeebo.

27:26.595 --> 27:28.395
Is that your name--
Zeebo?

27:31.733 --> 27:32.433
Wiploc.

27:34.603 --> 27:35.336
Wiploc. Hi.

27:37.239 --> 27:38.306
Makelsolakveder.

27:39.175 --> 27:42.042
Maybe I'll just
call you Mac.
How's that?

27:42.478 --> 27:43.811
Oh, and I'm Valerie.

27:44.480 --> 27:46.147
Valerie.
Walerie.Volare.

27:47.183 --> 27:50.050
You guys aren't
going to hurt me, are you?

27:53.389 --> 27:54.789
Your planet is weird.

27:55.691 --> 27:57.291
We're still
in my pool.

27:57.659 --> 27:58.526
Oh.
Oh!
Oh!

28:00.662 --> 28:03.508
Listen, it was really nice
meeting you, fellas,

28:03.532 --> 28:04.665
but I have to go.

28:05.667 --> 28:07.467
Feel free
to use the pool,

28:08.104 --> 28:10.504
but you've caught me
at a bad time.

28:12.241 --> 28:12.941
Aah!

28:13.775 --> 28:14.475
Aah! Aah!

28:27.189 --> 28:29.522
Did I do that?
I flooded the ship.

28:30.192 --> 28:32.437
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm so embarrassed.

28:32.461 --> 28:33.594
I'm really sorry,

28:34.096 --> 28:36.496
but I'm sure you can
fix it, right?

28:39.635 --> 28:40.702
Don't freak out.

28:41.203 --> 28:43.003
This is
just like the time

28:43.639 --> 28:46.306
I dropped my lady schick
in the toilet.

28:46.608 --> 28:49.008
After it dried out,
it worked fine.

28:55.717 --> 28:58.650
Let's go in my house.
I'll make some lunch,

28:59.221 --> 29:01.288
and I'll get
the pool drained.

29:01.657 --> 29:04.857
Then you guys can take off
back to your planet.

29:05.561 --> 29:06.561
Blast off. Pow.

29:07.163 --> 29:09.230
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
Â¿Comprende?

29:11.100 --> 29:11.900
Â¿Comprende?

29:12.401 --> 29:13.201
Â¿Comprende?

29:14.603 --> 29:15.303
Comprende.

29:28.684 --> 29:31.484
Be careful. This ladder's
a little loose.

29:32.221 --> 29:34.421
Oh, I'm glad
you can breathe OK.

29:34.856 --> 29:37.923
The air quality
is actually
very good today.

29:40.229 --> 29:40.929
Careful.

29:42.131 --> 29:43.264
It's kind of wet.

29:48.570 --> 29:49.270
OK?

29:50.206 --> 29:53.006
Well, uh, come on.
Let's go in the house.

29:53.575 --> 29:54.275
This way.

29:59.181 --> 30:00.314
Those are lemons.

30:00.582 --> 30:02.849
You know,
lemonade, lemon Pledge.

30:03.285 --> 30:05.352
Oh. It's OK.
It's a sprinkler.

30:06.655 --> 30:10.188
Earth people are going to
freak out if they see you.

30:10.726 --> 30:11.459
No offense,

30:12.361 --> 30:15.173
but you do look like
wookies or werewolves.

30:15.197 --> 30:17.264
People will want to
shoot you,

30:17.633 --> 30:18.966
so just be cool, OK?

30:21.337 --> 30:23.670
Let's go inside.
Come on. Come on.

30:26.175 --> 30:28.775
What's going on
in my horoscope today?

30:33.582 --> 30:35.182
Well, this is
my house.

30:35.851 --> 30:37.651
Um...sorry about
the mess.

30:38.454 --> 30:40.054
Make yourselves at home.

30:50.632 --> 30:52.365
Hi. This is
Valerie Gale.

30:52.468 --> 30:55.068
Could you send Woody
to drain my pool?

30:55.471 --> 30:58.204
Yeah. Right away.
It's an emergency. I--

31:11.787 --> 31:14.387
Wow! I've never see her
do tha before!

31:15.724 --> 31:18.391
What is that,
some kind of
love touch?

31:22.898 --> 31:23.765
Oh! Hi. Yeah.

31:24.566 --> 31:27.499
Listen. This is a matter
of life and death.

31:27.869 --> 31:30.336
I lost my contact lens
in the pool--

31:30.806 --> 31:33.406
No. Send Woody.
He found it last time.

31:33.709 --> 31:34.409
Hey!

31:34.776 --> 31:36.176
Those are Ted's fish!

31:36.678 --> 31:37.378
Thanks.

31:37.813 --> 31:38.813
No. No. No. No.

31:39.815 --> 31:40.515
Not food!

31:41.417 --> 31:42.117
Not food!

31:44.986 --> 31:46.986
Let's see.
Oh, not much here,

31:47.989 --> 31:51.122
but I didn't expect
I'd have aliens for lunch.

31:51.260 --> 31:51.960
Oh, look.

31:52.694 --> 31:53.894
Low-cal Pop Tarts.

31:54.696 --> 31:55.896
These are natural.

31:56.432 --> 31:57.132
Great.

32:02.738 --> 32:03.438
OK.

32:03.839 --> 32:05.839
We have an entree.
What else?

32:09.811 --> 32:11.211
Uh...instant pudding!

32:11.913 --> 32:14.113
Add water, hmm...
too much work.

32:14.783 --> 32:16.116
Oh, spray-on cheese!

32:16.785 --> 32:17.718
This is great.

32:18.387 --> 32:20.387
You have eggs
on your planet?

32:22.391 --> 32:24.258
I could cook those
for you.

32:26.395 --> 32:27.095
Uh...

32:35.437 --> 32:36.637
This is wonderful.

33:00.796 --> 33:02.863
Oh, Wiploc!
No! No! Not there!

33:03.532 --> 33:04.665
No. Come with me.

33:15.444 --> 33:17.177
OK. So you go
in there...

33:19.981 --> 33:21.514
No! No!
Come here. No.

33:22.584 --> 33:23.984
You... go in there...

33:25.321 --> 33:26.254
Go in there...

33:27.589 --> 33:29.456
Yeah...
and then you flush.

34:01.457 --> 34:03.190
Oh, my God!
Woody's here!

34:03.459 --> 34:05.792
Whatever you do,
just stay inside.

34:53.708 --> 34:54.409
Aah!

35:05.587 --> 35:06.787
You are Americans.

35:07.689 --> 35:10.022
You're the product
of the freest--

35:12.828 --> 35:14.428
You're tearing me apart!

35:15.797 --> 35:18.264
You say one thing,
he says another--

35:19.067 --> 35:19.767
A new car!

35:21.002 --> 35:22.069
A new car!
Aah!

35:23.004 --> 35:24.737
* Take
a mind excursion *

35:25.073 --> 35:26.140
* It's just... *

35:27.075 --> 35:28.408
Hey! How's it going?

35:29.778 --> 35:30.511
Hey, Woody.

35:31.780 --> 35:32.580
What's that?

35:33.148 --> 35:35.092
Some kind of giant
boogie board?

35:35.116 --> 35:38.029
No. It's my new
pool patio.
Bitchin', huh?

35:38.053 --> 35:38.786
Pretty rad.

35:40.556 --> 35:41.256
Whoa!

35:41.557 --> 35:43.024
Shoot the curl, kitty!

35:44.025 --> 35:46.292
Those little guys
love the water.

35:48.029 --> 35:51.696
Listen, Valerie,
how come you want
your pool drained?

35:51.933 --> 35:52.633
How come?

35:53.068 --> 35:53.935
I don't know.

35:54.670 --> 35:57.670
You know, the water
just seems really stale.

35:58.073 --> 35:59.806
We've seen
a lot of that.

36:00.241 --> 36:01.908
How long
will this take?

36:02.077 --> 36:03.344
Uh...about...a day.

36:06.582 --> 36:08.315
Whoa! Check out
the sets.

36:08.584 --> 36:11.784
If I was six inches tall,
I'd be out there now.

36:12.988 --> 36:15.855
They were pumping
like that this morning--

36:15.991 --> 36:17.391
I don't believe this.

36:17.993 --> 36:18.860
No, for real.

36:19.628 --> 36:22.840
I was getting barreled
in this totally cool tube.

36:22.864 --> 36:24.931
I had just Sex Waxed
my board.

36:25.734 --> 36:28.867
Someone shoots his board,
hits me in the head.

36:28.904 --> 36:30.104
This is the worst.

36:30.872 --> 36:33.539
Would have been
the ride of the decade.

36:34.009 --> 36:36.742
What am I supposed to
do until tomorrow?

36:37.045 --> 36:39.312
Waste your brain.
Wax your board.

36:39.915 --> 36:40.915
Pray for waves.

36:52.093 --> 36:52.793
Try this.

36:53.795 --> 36:55.262
* What'll it be? Hmm *

36:55.764 --> 36:56.831
* What'll it be?

36:57.298 --> 36:57.998
* Hmm *

36:58.767 --> 37:01.234
Make me an Alaskan
polar bear heater

37:01.670 --> 37:02.603
on the double.

37:03.038 --> 37:05.016
We'll make
our own music, gorgeous.

37:05.040 --> 37:06.173
You and you stay.

37:06.808 --> 37:09.275
Tubby, rest your thumbs.
I'll drive.

37:09.711 --> 37:12.311
Now watch, baby.
Every move a picture.

37:20.321 --> 37:23.054
Is there a doctor
in the house? Not now.

37:23.559 --> 37:26.226
Leave a message
when you hear the beep.

37:27.729 --> 37:29.329
Valerie?
Are you there?

37:29.565 --> 37:30.565
Please pick up.

37:30.932 --> 37:32.399
I need to talk to you.

37:33.101 --> 37:35.034
Sorry I was
such an asshole.

37:35.671 --> 37:37.871
Val, you've got to
believe this.

37:38.039 --> 37:41.018
I've never ever
been unfaithful to you. Ever.

37:41.042 --> 37:42.042
I'm only guilty

37:42.578 --> 37:45.178
of a little kissy-face
with one nurse.

37:45.280 --> 37:46.213
You stopped me

37:46.848 --> 37:49.381
from making a big mistake
last night.

37:49.718 --> 37:52.251
Val, I'm so sorry.
Please forgive me.

37:53.088 --> 37:55.421
I'll see you
when I get home. Bye.

38:00.328 --> 38:01.728
Come back to Finland.

38:02.698 --> 38:05.098
Come back to winter
all year round.

38:06.201 --> 38:08.801
Come back
to parkas and goat's cheese.

38:09.905 --> 38:11.838
Finland knows
what you want.

38:12.608 --> 38:15.408
Yodel-aydi, yodel-aydi,
yodel-ay-hee-hoo!

38:16.044 --> 38:18.823
Yodel-aydi, yodel-aydi,
yodel-aydi, yodel-aydi,

38:18.847 --> 38:19.547
hee-hoo!

38:21.082 --> 38:21.815
Television!

38:26.955 --> 38:28.622
OK. Well,
we're all set.

38:29.024 --> 38:30.091
Finland is here?

38:31.126 --> 38:33.326
Finland? No.
This is the valley.

38:33.394 --> 38:35.661
Finland is the capital
of Norway.

38:35.931 --> 38:36.931
You learn fast.

38:37.232 --> 38:39.165
Sorry I was
such an asshole.

38:39.835 --> 38:42.302
Oh! I see you found
a cable station.

38:42.838 --> 38:43.538
Valerie?

38:44.239 --> 38:46.306
Are you there?
Please pick up.

38:46.407 --> 38:47.274
Did Ted call?

38:47.909 --> 38:50.509
I'll be over
right after work tonight.

38:50.912 --> 38:51.912
OK, honey? Bye.

38:52.313 --> 38:53.046
Oh, my God!

38:54.149 --> 38:56.227
Ted is, like,
a trained doctor.

38:56.251 --> 38:57.584
One look at you guys

38:58.219 --> 39:00.419
and he'll know
you're not local.

39:00.822 --> 39:03.555
If I only had
a zillion gallons of Nair.

39:04.760 --> 39:05.893
Nair.Nair.
Nair.

39:09.197 --> 39:10.264
* I'm a sex pixy

39:11.767 --> 39:12.634
* Is that OK?

39:13.168 --> 39:14.235
* Do do do do do

39:16.204 --> 39:18.071
* Do do do
do do do do do *

39:19.741 --> 39:21.474
* Hey, hey,
do do do do *

39:23.945 --> 39:24.812
* Do do do do

39:25.981 --> 39:27.114
* Da-do, oh, oh *

39:27.916 --> 39:30.649
Candy, whatever you do,
don't freak out.

39:30.952 --> 39:31.652
Valerie!

39:31.720 --> 39:34.053
Promise me
you will not freak out.

39:34.923 --> 39:36.990
Stop! You are
freaking me out!

39:37.325 --> 39:39.325
Um...a UFO landed
in my pool,

39:39.928 --> 39:41.328
and they captured me,

39:41.930 --> 39:44.241
but we made friends,
and I fed them Pop Tarts.

39:44.265 --> 39:46.265
You've got to
cut their hair.

39:47.068 --> 39:48.201
What did you say?

39:48.904 --> 39:51.971
Oh, nothing.
I'm on drugs.
Candy, help them.

39:52.974 --> 39:54.974
Would you listen
to yourself?

39:55.343 --> 39:57.010
Valerie,
no man is worth

39:57.345 --> 39:59.812
getting yourself
in this state over.

39:59.981 --> 40:02.114
Mel Gibson, maybe,
but not Ted!

40:02.350 --> 40:03.617
Valerie, come here.

40:03.952 --> 40:05.352
Just sit down, honey.

40:05.987 --> 40:06.687
Relax.

40:07.388 --> 40:08.988
Have a mental Margarita.

40:09.390 --> 40:11.790
Now I'm going to
show you something

40:12.193 --> 40:14.438
that's going to
change your life.

40:14.462 --> 40:16.995
In that case,
let me get a cigarette.

40:21.169 --> 40:23.636
You got little
alien house guests...

40:24.472 --> 40:25.472
let's see them.

40:29.377 --> 40:30.310
Shit, Valerie!

40:30.946 --> 40:32.079
Those are aliens!

40:32.347 --> 40:33.080
I told you.

40:34.249 --> 40:35.449
Oh, God! Oh, shit!

40:36.517 --> 40:37.650
Valerie! Valerie!

40:37.953 --> 40:38.686
Those are--

40:38.954 --> 40:40.621
Those are big...
aliens!

40:41.189 --> 40:42.989
What do they want
from us?

40:43.091 --> 40:44.824
What do you want
from us?

40:45.493 --> 40:47.960
Did they take control
of your brain?

40:48.496 --> 40:50.029
Oh...I don't
think so.

40:50.265 --> 40:51.198
Can they talk?

40:51.800 --> 40:53.044
* What'll it be?
Hmm **

40:53.068 --> 40:55.001
I ate all
the Frusen Gladje.

40:55.070 --> 40:57.214
Panty shields
make me feel fresh.

40:57.238 --> 40:58.438
Are they straight?

40:59.340 --> 41:01.340
I don't know.
They're aliens!

41:01.943 --> 41:02.743
This is Mac,

41:03.344 --> 41:04.922
and this is,
uh...Zeebo,

41:04.946 --> 41:06.279
and this is
Wiploc.

41:08.483 --> 41:10.350
Well, they're
just darling.

41:10.786 --> 41:12.253
Get them
out of here.

41:12.788 --> 41:15.532
They can't leave
until the pool is drained.

41:15.556 --> 41:17.756
If Ted finds out
they're aliens,

41:18.026 --> 41:19.893
he'll want to
dissect them.

41:20.328 --> 41:22.861
We could make them
look more...human.

41:22.898 --> 41:25.898
I thought you never
wanted to see Ted again.

41:26.067 --> 41:28.534
I don't. I just want
to talk to him.

41:29.037 --> 41:30.704
Valerie,
this is insane.

41:31.172 --> 41:33.839
They're, like,
throwing up on my stuff!

41:34.109 --> 41:35.109
Come on, Candy.

41:38.579 --> 41:41.112
Well, I see split ends
are universal.

41:43.885 --> 41:46.552
Lost in space
with no conditioner, huh?

41:46.888 --> 41:49.821
I think they've
been up there
a long time.

41:50.291 --> 41:53.158
Well, it's all dead.
It's got to come off.

41:53.328 --> 41:54.261
Can you do it?

41:55.296 --> 41:57.229
Does Tina Turner
wear a wig?

41:57.899 --> 41:58.766
That's a wig?

41:59.300 --> 42:00.700
That's a wig.
Great!

42:01.903 --> 42:03.036
I'll get clothes!

42:03.304 --> 42:05.704
If I find one flea,
the deal's off!

42:07.909 --> 42:09.509
OK, Val,
are you ready?

42:10.011 --> 42:11.889
I think
they're almost done.

42:11.913 --> 42:14.713
I gave the red one
the blond-surfer look.

42:17.552 --> 42:18.252
Wow!

42:19.955 --> 42:21.222
Which one
is that?

42:21.857 --> 42:22.557
Wiploc.

42:23.124 --> 42:24.257
We are human now!

42:25.360 --> 42:27.760
I don't believe it!
He's even cute!

42:28.129 --> 42:29.662
I know!
Bitchin', huh?

42:30.265 --> 42:32.198
Val, you won't
believe this.

42:33.101 --> 42:33.801
OK...

42:36.972 --> 42:37.672
Surprise!

42:42.210 --> 42:43.143
Is that Zeebo?

42:43.444 --> 42:46.177
Oh, my God!
You're, like, totally black!

42:50.051 --> 42:50.751
OK...

42:51.086 --> 42:53.353
and...behind
door number three...

42:53.488 --> 42:54.955
this is
the ultimate!

43:05.433 --> 43:06.133
Wow!

43:09.437 --> 43:10.637
You're incredible.

43:15.276 --> 43:18.009
Well, it was easy.
I started on poodles.

43:18.646 --> 43:19.346
Good?

43:20.916 --> 43:21.616
Real good.

43:26.421 --> 43:27.121
OK. OK.

43:28.023 --> 43:29.556
Group picture. Come on.

43:30.025 --> 43:31.692
Come on.
Get down there.

43:34.062 --> 43:34.862
All right...

43:35.463 --> 43:37.196
now say,
Velveeta Slices.

43:38.366 --> 43:40.099
Sl--Vegakld.
Vel--salksi.

43:42.470 --> 43:45.337
OK, you guys,
what's the plan for tonight?

43:45.473 --> 43:47.340
Whoa! Candy,
reality check.

43:47.542 --> 43:49.742
We can't go out.
They're aliens!

43:50.145 --> 43:52.078
So? They can still
be dates!

43:52.580 --> 43:55.513
Do you guys have Margaritas
on your planet?

43:55.683 --> 43:58.016
It's not safe.
I'll take you home.

43:58.619 --> 44:00.952
Don't get your panties
in a bunch.

44:01.689 --> 44:04.668
We're with major cute guys.
It's Saturday night!

44:04.692 --> 44:05.392
Come on!

44:11.366 --> 44:14.633
You guys are so lucky
you crashed in the valley.

44:15.336 --> 44:17.536
It's the baddest place
on earth.

44:26.114 --> 44:27.181
Candy, sit down!

44:28.984 --> 44:29.717
Hi, sweets.

44:31.052 --> 44:34.252
I think we'd like to keep
a low profile, Candy.

44:35.156 --> 44:37.023
Guys, what you
doing later?

44:41.096 --> 44:44.241
I never would have believed
that this could happen.

44:44.265 --> 44:47.044
That you'd be cruising
with shaved Martians?

44:47.068 --> 44:49.335
No. That Ted would
do this to me.

44:50.305 --> 44:53.384
Give men enough rope,
they'll dig their own grave.

44:53.408 --> 44:54.108
So true.

44:54.575 --> 44:56.842
He said he wanted
one last fling.

44:57.545 --> 44:59.878
Maybe that's normal,
I don't know.

45:00.148 --> 45:03.094
I'm sure
we'll be happy
once we're married,

45:03.118 --> 45:05.562
but I can't pretend
this didn't happen.

45:05.586 --> 45:08.386
Valerie, you work hard
to make Ted happy.

45:08.456 --> 45:10.056
Who is making you happy?

45:17.732 --> 45:18.432
Woo!
Woo!

45:19.467 --> 45:20.400
Finland babes!

45:20.735 --> 45:23.535
Yodel-aydi, yodel-aydi,
yodel-ay-hee-hoo!

45:24.372 --> 45:26.505
Didn't you go to
Van Nuys High?

45:27.342 --> 45:28.275
Van Nuys High?

45:29.210 --> 45:30.754
Aren't you
Terry Harper's brother?

45:30.778 --> 45:32.378
Terry Harper's
brother?

45:32.613 --> 45:33.313
Ha ha ha!

45:34.115 --> 45:36.193
Someone should
hose those girls down!

45:36.217 --> 45:37.150
Want to party?

45:37.652 --> 45:38.585
Want to party?

45:39.154 --> 45:39.854
Come on!

45:46.761 --> 45:47.461
Wiploc!

45:51.332 --> 45:52.732
Look! There they are!

45:57.338 --> 45:58.405
OK. Don't worry.

45:58.739 --> 45:59.806
I'll go get him.

46:00.741 --> 46:02.274
Me, too.
Me, too, too.

46:02.743 --> 46:03.443
Wait--

46:03.744 --> 46:05.477
It'll only take
a minute.

46:10.218 --> 46:12.818
Come on, you guys,
what are you doing?

46:20.261 --> 46:23.074
* When I need something
to help me unwind *

46:23.098 --> 46:26.365
* I find a six-foot baby
with a one-track mind *

46:26.834 --> 46:29.901
* Smart guys are nowhere,
they make demands *

46:30.671 --> 46:33.538
* Give me a moron
with talented hands... *

46:33.708 --> 46:35.308
Where did you buy those?

46:36.144 --> 46:37.277
They're my dad's.

46:37.412 --> 46:38.679
Those are fabulous.

46:39.147 --> 46:39.847
I know.

46:40.815 --> 46:42.526
* ...In love
till we're done *

46:42.550 --> 46:44.750
* Then they're
out in the hall *

46:44.819 --> 46:46.152
* I like 'em big and

46:46.721 --> 46:47.421
* Stupid

46:48.356 --> 46:49.689
* I like 'em big and

46:50.625 --> 46:51.358
* Real dumb

46:51.592 --> 46:52.925
* I like 'em big and

46:53.628 --> 46:54.328
* Stupid

46:58.766 --> 47:01.433
* What kind of guy
does a lot for me? *

47:02.637 --> 47:04.570
* Superman
with a lobotomy *

47:05.540 --> 47:07.518
* My father's
out of Harvard *

47:07.542 --> 47:09.275
* My brother's out of Yale

47:09.310 --> 47:11.188
* But the guy
I took home last night *

47:11.212 --> 47:13.079
* Just got
out of jail... *

47:13.214 --> 47:14.814
Valerie! Hi!
Over here!

47:14.849 --> 47:15.582
Candy!
Hi!

47:17.185 --> 47:19.452
Are you nuts?
What are you doing?

47:19.887 --> 47:21.020
Having cocktails.

47:23.158 --> 47:24.958
Alaskan
polar bear heater.

47:25.460 --> 47:27.327
Ted is coming home
tonight,

47:27.428 --> 47:29.895
and there's a UFO
in my pool. A UFO!

47:31.432 --> 47:34.299
B.F.D. Ted won't be there
for a few hours.

47:34.835 --> 47:35.835
Just chill out.

47:36.504 --> 47:38.171
Let's get
these guys out

47:38.539 --> 47:40.417
before anyone realizes
they're aliens.

47:40.441 --> 47:43.308
No one's going to know
they're aliens, OK?

47:43.478 --> 47:44.178
Tanya!

47:46.314 --> 47:47.447
Hi. You know Val,

47:48.349 --> 47:50.727
and this is Mac,
Wiploc, and Zeebo.

47:50.751 --> 47:53.797
They're from Mars
or something!
Could you die?

47:53.821 --> 47:55.621
Hey, Zeebo,
want to dance?

47:56.857 --> 47:57.790
Want to dance?

47:58.426 --> 47:59.159
Great idea.

48:02.430 --> 48:03.130
Wiploc.

48:05.433 --> 48:06.433
Should I dance?

48:07.368 --> 48:08.068
Sure.

48:08.669 --> 48:10.202
Fine. Hey,
party down.

48:11.272 --> 48:13.350
When you're ready
for your chauffeur,

48:13.374 --> 48:15.107
I'll be out
on the patio.

48:16.811 --> 48:18.078
What's her problem?

48:20.815 --> 48:21.515
Two weeks?

48:23.518 --> 48:24.218
Whoa!

48:24.719 --> 48:26.786
* ...'Cause
it was so stupid *

48:27.222 --> 48:30.155
* The bigger they come,
the harder I fall *

48:30.291 --> 48:31.835
* In love till we're done

48:31.859 --> 48:33.504
* Then they're
out in the hall... *

48:33.528 --> 48:34.995
Come on.
Let's dance.

48:35.796 --> 48:36.496
Woo!

48:37.498 --> 48:38.831
* I like 'em big and

48:39.500 --> 48:40.233
* Real dumb

48:41.302 --> 48:42.779
* I like 'em big and...

48:42.803 --> 48:43.503
He left?

48:47.975 --> 48:49.508
* She likes 'em big and

48:50.378 --> 48:51.078
* Stupid *

49:07.562 --> 49:10.162
You, go rest
your thumbs.
I'll drive.

49:41.562 --> 49:43.507
You could actually
play that?

49:43.531 --> 49:46.264
Valerie, are we limp
and hard to manage?

49:47.067 --> 49:48.734
Oh, no, no.
You're fine.

49:49.737 --> 49:50.437
I'm sorry.

49:50.871 --> 49:53.338
I just don't feel
like talking much.

49:54.875 --> 49:58.455
I guess I figured that
everything would
just fall into place

49:58.479 --> 49:59.946
if I found
Mr. Right.

50:00.448 --> 50:01.148
Mr. Right?

50:02.550 --> 50:05.750
Mr. Right is
like the guy you
dream of meeting

50:06.587 --> 50:08.787
ever since you're
a little girl.

50:09.089 --> 50:11.289
You'd go anyplace
or do anything

50:11.726 --> 50:12.726
to be together.

50:13.561 --> 50:15.306
He feels
the same way about you

50:15.330 --> 50:17.797
because you're right
for each other.

50:18.399 --> 50:19.266
I don't know.

50:19.800 --> 50:21.533
Maybe
I'm kidding myself.

50:21.802 --> 50:23.735
Maybe there's
no such thing.

50:32.046 --> 50:34.113
* Baby gonna
shake all night *

50:34.515 --> 50:36.515
* Baby gonna
shake it right *

50:36.651 --> 50:38.584
* Baby gonna
shake so fast *

50:38.686 --> 50:39.886
* Out on the floor

50:40.655 --> 50:42.633
* Baby gonna
shake all night *

50:42.657 --> 50:44.657
* Baby gonna
shake it right *

50:44.792 --> 50:46.370
* Baby gonna
shake so fast *

50:46.394 --> 50:47.094
Hey, baby.

50:47.828 --> 50:51.295
Why be with a zero
when you can dance
with a hero?

50:52.967 --> 50:53.667
* Oh, baby

50:56.804 --> 50:58.137
* You got to tell me

50:58.773 --> 51:01.240
* Where it takes us
you don't care *

51:01.909 --> 51:02.642
* Ooh, yeah

51:04.945 --> 51:07.057
* Baby, just fix up
your hair *

51:07.081 --> 51:09.881
* It doesn't matter
what you wear to me *

51:12.920 --> 51:14.865
* Get yourself back
in your car *

51:14.889 --> 51:17.022
* We don't have to
go too far *

51:17.925 --> 51:18.625
* To see

51:19.660 --> 51:20.360
* Oh, baby

51:21.496 --> 51:22.406
* Baby gonna
shake all night *

51:22.430 --> 51:24.430
* Baby gonna
shake it right *

51:25.165 --> 51:27.098
* Baby gonna
shake so fast *

51:27.768 --> 51:28.879
* Out on the floor

51:28.903 --> 51:30.303
* Come on, now, hurry

51:30.938 --> 51:32.549
* There's always something
we can do *

51:32.573 --> 51:36.040
Why be with a hero
when you can dance
with a zero?

51:37.478 --> 51:38.878
* Don't have to worry

51:39.514 --> 51:42.047
* As long as I'm not there
with you *

51:42.417 --> 51:43.484
* Oh, yeah, yeah

51:44.952 --> 51:47.085
* Baby, just fix up
your hair *

51:47.955 --> 51:50.755
* It doesn't matter
what you wear to me *

51:54.429 --> 51:55.672
* Get yourself back
in your car *

51:55.696 --> 51:57.829
* We don't have to
go too far *

51:58.699 --> 51:59.399
Whoa.

52:00.701 --> 52:01.701
Back off, Jack!

52:02.136 --> 52:03.869
The lucky lady's
with me,

52:04.104 --> 52:06.571
and don't be copping
my dance moves.

52:07.475 --> 52:10.053
I'll dance
with you both.
I don't care.

52:10.077 --> 52:12.410
No, no, no.
You don't
understand.

52:12.713 --> 52:13.713
He can't dance.

52:14.114 --> 52:16.514
All right. I know
he can't do this.

52:18.619 --> 52:20.531
* Baby gonna
shake all night *

52:20.555 --> 52:22.555
* Baby gonna
shake it right *

52:22.823 --> 52:24.756
* Baby gonna
shake so fast *

52:25.225 --> 52:26.425
* Out on the floor

52:26.727 --> 52:28.739
* Baby gonna
shake all night *

52:28.763 --> 52:30.763
* Baby gonna
shake it right *

52:30.998 --> 52:32.809
* Baby gonna
shake so fast *

52:32.833 --> 52:34.033
* Out on the floor

52:34.735 --> 52:35.868
* Shake all night

52:36.737 --> 52:37.948
* Don't you
want to shake it? *

52:37.972 --> 52:40.039
* Baby gonna dance
all night *

52:40.240 --> 52:41.640
* Come shake it, baby

52:42.810 --> 52:44.187
* Baby gonna
shake all night *

52:44.211 --> 52:45.088
* Shake it, baby

52:45.112 --> 52:47.045
* Shake it, baby,
shake it *

52:47.114 --> 52:48.247
* Dance all night

52:49.083 --> 52:50.283
* Out on the floor

52:57.858 --> 52:58.725
Come on, man.

53:03.097 --> 53:04.430
Hot damn!
Hot damn!

53:08.235 --> 53:10.502
* There's nothing
I'd rather do *

53:13.240 --> 53:15.440
* Right here
while you're mine *

53:16.977 --> 53:18.377
* Being here with you

53:19.947 --> 53:22.080
* Leaving it
all behind, baby *

53:26.253 --> 53:27.653
All right!
Hey! Woo!

53:39.233 --> 53:41.366
* Baby, just fix up
your hair *

53:41.569 --> 53:44.369
* It doesn't matter
what you wear to me *

53:47.274 --> 53:49.541
* Get yourself back
in your car *

53:49.710 --> 53:51.843
* We don't have to
go too far *

53:52.847 --> 53:53.547
* To see

53:53.981 --> 53:54.681
* Oh, baby

53:55.583 --> 53:57.594
* Baby gonna
shake all night *

53:57.618 --> 53:59.618
* Baby gonna
shake it right *

53:59.687 --> 54:01.620
* Baby gonna
shake so fast *

54:02.222 --> 54:03.422
* Out on the floor

54:03.758 --> 54:05.825
* Baby gonna
shake all night *

54:06.093 --> 54:07.203
* Baby gonna
shake it right *

54:07.227 --> 54:09.160
* Baby gonna
shake so fast *

54:10.064 --> 54:11.264
* Out on the floor

54:12.099 --> 54:13.232
* Shake all night

54:13.768 --> 54:14.468
Damn!

54:15.636 --> 54:16.336
* Baby *

54:26.647 --> 54:28.314
I'm going home
with him.

54:28.783 --> 54:30.450
I'm going home
with him.

54:32.587 --> 54:34.254
I'm going home
with him.

54:36.223 --> 54:36.923
Bitch.

54:38.859 --> 54:41.271
I don't even know
what planet
you're from.

54:41.295 --> 54:41.995
Jhazalla.

54:42.897 --> 54:45.564
Oh. We've only been
as far as the moon.

54:49.904 --> 54:51.171
You know, at first,

54:51.906 --> 54:53.839
I thought you
kind of looked

54:54.241 --> 54:56.574
like a giant bigfoot
or something,

54:56.877 --> 55:00.077
but now...
if I didn't know
you were an alien,

55:01.248 --> 55:04.715
I would just think
that you were
a really cute guy

55:05.853 --> 55:08.053
who, I'm sure,
has a girlfriend.

55:08.623 --> 55:10.223
No Mr. Right girlfriend.

55:21.001 --> 55:22.134
Yodel-ay-hee-hoo!

55:24.839 --> 55:26.639
Oh, my God.
That's Wiploc.

55:27.241 --> 55:27.941
* Hit me *

55:29.844 --> 55:30.544
All right!

55:31.178 --> 55:31.878
All right!

55:32.780 --> 55:33.480
All right!

55:48.128 --> 55:50.106
Give me your autograph
on my forehead.

55:50.130 --> 55:50.863
Sign these.

55:54.434 --> 55:57.367
Candy, you're frenching
an alien in public!

56:02.943 --> 56:03.643
You OK?

56:04.845 --> 56:05.912
Wiploc.
Wiploc.

56:06.747 --> 56:09.280
I want to be zero.
I want to be zero.

56:11.819 --> 56:12.552
No, no, no.

56:17.391 --> 56:19.124
Candy, uh,
I'll call you.

56:19.293 --> 56:20.760
Oh, what
was it like?

56:21.729 --> 56:23.662
Oh, my God!
You're so lucky!

56:23.998 --> 56:25.598
Did you get
his number?

56:25.733 --> 56:26.800
I want his baby.

56:30.404 --> 56:31.137
Sweetheart?

56:32.106 --> 56:33.639
Sweetheart,
I'm sorry.

56:34.274 --> 56:34.974
Val?

56:40.014 --> 56:40.714
Honey?

56:42.182 --> 56:42.882
Hey, Val?

56:48.088 --> 56:49.755
What?
Oh, wait a second.

56:50.090 --> 56:53.436
They said the Commodore
would stand up to anything.

56:53.460 --> 56:54.160
Oh!

56:56.063 --> 56:57.130
Beamer?
Beamer?

57:01.035 --> 57:01.735
Beamer.

57:03.437 --> 57:04.904
Astin, where's Martin?

57:05.405 --> 57:07.017
Where's Val?
Don't, don't panic.

57:07.041 --> 57:09.285
She probably wasn't here
when it happened.

57:09.309 --> 57:12.842
Operator,
give me the police.
This is an emergency.

57:27.427 --> 57:29.039
Police?
This is Dr. Gallagher.

57:29.063 --> 57:31.063
I'd like to report
a break-in

57:32.166 --> 57:34.433
and...
and a possible kidnapping.

57:36.470 --> 57:37.870
Oh, God.
Ted's here.

57:38.038 --> 57:39.705
You guys,
act human, OK?

57:40.908 --> 57:41.908
Just act human.

57:44.044 --> 57:46.056
Oh, sweetheart,
you're all right.

57:46.080 --> 57:48.213
Oh, I was so worried
about you.

57:49.049 --> 57:51.782
When I came home,
the house was wrecked.

57:54.554 --> 57:55.421
Who are they?

57:57.357 --> 57:58.957
Who?
Those guys?
Yeah.

58:00.094 --> 58:00.794
A band.

58:01.295 --> 58:02.895
Boy,
I'm totally clear.

58:04.298 --> 58:06.765
You mean like
a rock 'n' roll
band?

58:06.834 --> 58:09.301
What are you doing
with a band, Val?

58:09.837 --> 58:11.104
I won them
on MTV.

58:11.538 --> 58:13.805
I won an MTV weekend
with a band.

58:14.541 --> 58:15.741
Hi. I am, uh, Mac.

58:17.077 --> 58:19.010
How is it hanging,
Mr. Dude?

58:19.479 --> 58:20.812
Dr. Dude.
Dr. Dude?

58:22.416 --> 58:24.683
I came home
to talk to you alone.

58:27.587 --> 58:31.401
This is private.
I'm sure you won't mind
when I ask you to leave.

58:31.425 --> 58:34.404
They can't leave.
They're spending
the weekend.

58:34.428 --> 58:37.028
No, Val. They can't.
This is my house.

58:38.432 --> 58:41.499
Your house? Wait.
I threw you out,
Dr. Love.

58:42.937 --> 58:45.481
I'm going to
throw them out.
What about that?

58:45.505 --> 58:47.305
No, you're not.
Yes, I am.

58:47.574 --> 58:48.774
I won them.
What?

58:51.045 --> 58:52.712
You're tearing
me apart!

58:54.915 --> 58:58.061
You have no business being
with these weird people.

58:58.085 --> 59:00.864
I never won
a band before.
They're staying.

59:00.888 --> 59:02.955
I want you
to be happy,
but--

59:03.090 --> 59:04.423
Dr. Dude?
What now?

59:04.491 --> 59:05.358
Yee-wah.
Ah!

59:06.961 --> 59:08.628
He was good.
You animal!

59:10.865 --> 59:13.198
I ought to give you
a tracheotomy.

59:13.567 --> 59:16.500
That was Mercedes,
my most expensive
fish!

59:16.636 --> 59:19.369
Hey, what's
going on here?
Break it up.

59:20.908 --> 59:23.041
Hey, hey! Come on!
Break it up.

59:24.945 --> 59:26.212
What are you doing?

59:26.346 --> 59:27.746
Who's
Dr. Gallagher?

59:28.082 --> 59:29.349
I'm
Dr. Gallagher.

59:30.317 --> 59:32.195
Uh-huh.
I'm Officer Demonte.

59:32.219 --> 59:33.819
This is
Officer Murphy.

59:34.021 --> 59:36.867
You reported a break-in
and possible kidnapping?

59:36.891 --> 59:38.758
Yes, I did,
but she's fine.

59:39.293 --> 59:42.426
However,
these degenerates
broke into my home

59:44.264 --> 59:46.064
and destroyed
my property.

59:46.133 --> 59:48.879
I want them arrested
right now.
They're MTV scum!

59:48.903 --> 59:52.170
Ma'am, you mind telling us
what's going on here?

59:52.339 --> 59:54.250
This man doesn't
live here anymore,

59:54.274 --> 59:56.341
and he's strangling
my guests.

59:57.945 --> 59:59.555
He was eating
my Blue-Gilled
Dorky.

59:59.579 --> 01:00:00.712
Watch your mouth!

01:00:01.481 --> 01:00:03.481
10-13. We got
a false report.

01:00:05.052 --> 01:00:06.719
Just a domestic
dispute.

01:00:07.487 --> 01:00:10.420
His girlfriend
dumped him
for a rock band.

01:00:11.558 --> 01:00:12.258
Bullshit!

01:00:13.460 --> 01:00:15.660
Let's go where
you can cool off.

01:00:16.296 --> 01:00:17.163
I'm a doctor!

01:00:18.265 --> 01:00:20.610
If we bust your arm,
you can put on
your own cast.

01:00:20.634 --> 01:00:23.101
You're right, Val.
I don't know you.

01:00:24.304 --> 01:00:27.171
If you thought I'd spend
my life with you,

01:00:27.374 --> 01:00:30.186
your friends, and
that psychotic cat of yours,

01:00:30.210 --> 01:00:31.077
you're crazy!

01:00:31.445 --> 01:00:34.112
The wedding's off, Val!
Come on, buddy.

01:00:37.985 --> 01:00:40.052
You want to dance
with a zero?

01:00:41.021 --> 01:00:41.721
I'm sorry.

01:00:43.090 --> 01:00:45.557
I think I have to
go to my room now.

01:01:21.361 --> 01:01:22.694
Is Ted
coming back?

01:01:28.435 --> 01:01:30.768
No. Ted doesn't want
to come back.

01:01:31.771 --> 01:01:33.704
I don't know
what Ted wants,

01:01:34.074 --> 01:01:35.141
but it's not me.

01:01:36.510 --> 01:01:38.110
What does
Valerie want?

01:01:39.779 --> 01:01:40.646
I don't know.

01:01:41.381 --> 01:01:43.048
I just want
to be happy.

01:01:44.018 --> 01:01:46.018
Mac could make
Valerie happy.

01:01:46.653 --> 01:01:48.320
Thanks, but I don't think

01:01:49.289 --> 01:01:52.489
anybody could make me feel
very good right now.

01:01:52.792 --> 01:01:54.659
Mac could make
Valerie feel

01:01:54.761 --> 01:01:55.828
very, very good.

01:01:57.497 --> 01:02:00.164
Wait a minute.
Are you coming on to me?

01:02:01.068 --> 01:02:02.068
Is this a pass?

01:02:02.602 --> 01:02:06.269
Because if it is,
sex is totally
out of the question.

01:02:07.807 --> 01:02:08.607
What is sex?

01:02:09.809 --> 01:02:11.676
Sex? You know,
making love.

01:02:12.212 --> 01:02:14.545
A man and a woman
like each other,

01:02:15.215 --> 01:02:17.882
and they take
their clothes off, and...

01:02:18.352 --> 01:02:19.052
OK.

01:02:20.754 --> 01:02:21.887
Well, no, no, no!

01:02:22.722 --> 01:02:25.322
We can't because
me and Ted are, uh...

01:02:25.759 --> 01:02:28.292
I guess we're not,
but, I mean, uh...

01:02:28.762 --> 01:02:31.029
we can't because
you're an alien,

01:02:31.365 --> 01:02:32.965
and I'm from the valley.

01:02:33.333 --> 01:02:37.133
We may not even be
anatomically correct
for each other.

01:02:37.337 --> 01:02:39.337
That could be
a real problem.

01:02:40.740 --> 01:02:41.473
No problem.

01:02:42.342 --> 01:02:44.275
But, I mean, uh,
no, no, no.

01:02:45.345 --> 01:02:47.412
I mean,
it just wouldn't work.

01:02:47.781 --> 01:02:49.381
You're from out of town.

01:02:49.749 --> 01:02:52.282
The phone bills
would just be hell...

01:02:52.786 --> 01:02:53.486
Shh.

01:02:53.587 --> 01:02:56.054
Well, I just don't
want you to think

01:02:56.723 --> 01:02:58.123
Earth girls are easy.

01:02:58.725 --> 01:02:59.592
What is easy?

01:03:00.727 --> 01:03:01.594
This is easy.

01:04:56.643 --> 01:04:57.343
Aah!

01:05:04.251 --> 01:05:04.951
Ah!

01:05:07.787 --> 01:05:08.487
Oh!

01:05:20.867 --> 01:05:22.067
Yeah,
yeah, yeah!

01:05:22.569 --> 01:05:23.702
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

01:05:23.770 --> 01:05:25.637
I told you
not to have fun.

01:05:43.357 --> 01:05:44.057
Help!

01:05:59.773 --> 01:06:00.473
Ted!

01:06:02.842 --> 01:06:03.542
Help!

01:06:05.779 --> 01:06:07.779
Uh-oh.
Uh, don't go anywhere.

01:06:08.948 --> 01:06:10.015
I've been paged.

01:06:10.950 --> 01:06:11.950
Oh, sweetheart.

01:06:12.719 --> 01:06:13.419
Ted.

01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:14.720
Ted, make it stop.

01:06:15.489 --> 01:06:16.189
Ted.

01:06:18.458 --> 01:06:20.191
What happened
to my fish?

01:06:24.631 --> 01:06:25.331
Ted!

01:06:33.673 --> 01:06:34.373
Beamer!

01:06:35.509 --> 01:06:37.242
Your face!
What happened?

01:06:47.321 --> 01:06:48.254
Ted!
Stop it.

01:06:50.790 --> 01:06:51.923
Stop it! Stop it!

01:06:56.663 --> 01:06:57.363
Aaah!

01:07:31.798 --> 01:07:32.498
Hi.

01:07:34.401 --> 01:07:35.101
Hi.

01:07:39.839 --> 01:07:40.539
God.

01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:43.107
I had the weirdest
dream last night.

01:07:43.810 --> 01:07:45.077
All I remember is--

01:07:45.845 --> 01:07:46.545
Shh...

01:07:54.521 --> 01:07:56.788
You have
the strangest heartbeat.

01:07:57.156 --> 01:07:59.356
Sounds like
you have two hearts.

01:07:59.793 --> 01:08:00.493
Yes.

01:08:01.060 --> 01:08:01.760
Don't you?

01:08:03.930 --> 01:08:05.263
No. I just have one.

01:08:07.901 --> 01:08:09.501
Tell me
about Zimbabwe.

01:08:09.903 --> 01:08:10.603
Jhazalla?

01:08:12.071 --> 01:08:13.938
Jhazalla.
Is it like Earth?

01:08:15.575 --> 01:08:16.975
Yes.
It's beautiful.

01:08:17.810 --> 01:08:20.678
Sounds neat.
Is driving a UFO
a good job?

01:08:21.948 --> 01:08:22.648
Oh, yes.

01:08:23.817 --> 01:08:26.084
Do you own
your own home or rent?

01:08:26.685 --> 01:08:28.086
No water.
Come look.

01:09:35.188 --> 01:09:35.888
Hi, guys.

01:09:37.223 --> 01:09:38.956
Hope instant decaf
is OK.

01:09:39.826 --> 01:09:40.970
Breakfast is on the way.

01:09:40.993 --> 01:09:43.261
I'm making pancakes
from scratch.

01:09:43.830 --> 01:09:45.162
Yeah. Valerie, uh...

01:09:46.232 --> 01:09:47.499
we can go home now.

01:09:47.934 --> 01:09:48.634
Oh.

01:09:50.103 --> 01:09:51.502
Gee...
that's great.

01:09:54.641 --> 01:09:57.374
Wow. I didn't think
it would be so soon.

01:09:58.978 --> 01:09:59.678
Yeah.

01:10:01.848 --> 01:10:03.981
That's, uh,
that's really good.

01:10:04.951 --> 01:10:06.284
Yeah. Uh, Valerie...

01:10:12.559 --> 01:10:14.426
Well, I better go
get that.

01:10:15.094 --> 01:10:15.794
Pool man!

01:10:16.963 --> 01:10:18.963
Hey, dudes,
what's happening?

01:10:20.900 --> 01:10:21.833
Woody.
Woody.

01:10:23.737 --> 01:10:24.604
What is this?

01:10:25.772 --> 01:10:27.372
A spaceship?
Spaceship?

01:10:32.612 --> 01:10:33.479
No way, Jose.

01:10:34.614 --> 01:10:35.881
What is it?
A car.

01:10:36.750 --> 01:10:39.161
That's why she wanted me
to drain it.

01:10:39.185 --> 01:10:40.863
She drove her car
into the pool.

01:10:40.887 --> 01:10:42.354
I'm always doing that.

01:10:42.956 --> 01:10:45.756
Pretty rad car, though.
Where is it made?

01:10:47.093 --> 01:10:47.793
Finland.

01:10:48.962 --> 01:10:50.029
Finland.Finland.

01:10:50.229 --> 01:10:51.562
Oh, I heard of that.

01:10:52.298 --> 01:10:55.365
Ted, bringing that girl
here was inexcusable.

01:10:56.235 --> 01:11:00.102
Now that I've slept on it,
I could probably
forgive you,

01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:02.985
but what about
calling off the wedding?

01:11:03.009 --> 01:11:05.142
Sweetheart,
I didn't mean that.

01:11:05.579 --> 01:11:08.558
Marrying you is the most
important thing in the world.

01:11:08.582 --> 01:11:10.649
I need you
to take care of me.

01:11:11.585 --> 01:11:14.385
I won't so much
as look at another woman,

01:11:14.988 --> 01:11:18.855
unless, of course, I'm giving
her a physical examination.

01:11:19.993 --> 01:11:22.793
A relationship is
like a porcelain nail--

01:11:24.964 --> 01:11:27.943
You can break it,
you can glue it
back together,

01:11:27.967 --> 01:11:29.945
but it won't be
as strong as before

01:11:29.969 --> 01:11:33.215
unless the person's
committed and not
bringing home nurses.

01:11:33.239 --> 01:11:35.506
You should've seen me
today, man.

01:11:36.375 --> 01:11:38.821
Nothing but radical rips
all the way in.

01:11:38.845 --> 01:11:40.255
You want
some slushy?

01:11:40.279 --> 01:11:42.012
I was barely
off my board

01:11:43.382 --> 01:11:45.715
when the wahines
were all over me.

01:11:46.019 --> 01:11:46.819
Ew! Wahines!

01:11:48.287 --> 01:11:50.020
Wahines.
You know, girls.

01:11:52.058 --> 01:11:53.591
Girls?
You know girls?

01:11:54.994 --> 01:11:56.371
Does the Woodburger
know girls?

01:11:56.395 --> 01:11:58.328
Pinocchio got
a wooden butt?

01:11:58.698 --> 01:12:01.765
I could fix you up
with some bodacious chicks

01:12:02.068 --> 01:12:03.068
just like that.

01:12:04.237 --> 01:12:06.437
You don't believe me?
Like that.

01:12:07.707 --> 01:12:11.240
Come on. Let's hit the beach.
Ride the wild bikinis!

01:12:11.410 --> 01:12:12.477
We go get Candy?

01:12:13.980 --> 01:12:16.847
Candy, gum,
beer nuts,
anything you want.

01:12:16.983 --> 01:12:18.293
Twizzlers.
I got some
Milk Duds.

01:12:18.317 --> 01:12:20.162
You ought to
lay off coffee.

01:12:20.186 --> 01:12:21.853
It'll kill you
in a day.

01:12:23.122 --> 01:12:25.189
I will take you
to Zuma Beach.

01:12:27.293 --> 01:12:28.426
I need surprises.

01:12:28.828 --> 01:12:29.828
I need romance.

01:12:30.363 --> 01:12:31.696
How long has it been

01:12:32.331 --> 01:12:34.931
since you said
I love you, I need you,

01:12:36.402 --> 01:12:37.735
I'm crazy about you?

01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:41.740
Well, Ted?

01:12:42.776 --> 01:12:44.509
Get in the car,
will you?

01:12:44.778 --> 01:12:45.778
Wiploc.
Zeebo.

01:12:50.750 --> 01:12:52.550
Zeebo going
to Zuma Beach!

01:12:55.755 --> 01:12:56.455
Zeebo!

01:12:57.123 --> 01:12:57.823
Wiploc!

01:12:58.892 --> 01:13:01.336
Hey, dudes,
I just remembered
something.

01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:02.160
What was it?

01:13:02.929 --> 01:13:04.196
At the beach today,

01:13:04.964 --> 01:13:07.943
they're having
a blond-of-the-month
contest.

01:13:07.967 --> 01:13:08.667
Blond?

01:13:08.935 --> 01:13:09.935
Yeah, you know,

01:13:10.369 --> 01:13:13.169
blond beach bunnies,
California's finest.

01:13:27.721 --> 01:13:30.332
* Because I'm blond
I don't have to think *

01:13:30.356 --> 01:13:31.689
* I talk like a baby

01:13:32.058 --> 01:13:33.368
* And I never pay
for drinks *

01:13:33.392 --> 01:13:36.105
* Don't have to worry
about getting a man *

01:13:36.129 --> 01:13:38.808
* If I keep this blond
and I keep these tanned *

01:13:38.832 --> 01:13:41.565
* 'Cause I'm a blond,
yeah, yeah, yeah *

01:13:41.735 --> 01:13:44.313
* 'Cause I'm a blond,
yeah, yeah, yeah *

01:13:44.337 --> 01:13:45.804
* I see people working

01:13:46.105 --> 01:13:47.482
* It just makes me giggle

01:13:47.506 --> 01:13:48.718
* 'Cause I don't
have to work *

01:13:48.742 --> 01:13:50.275
* I just have to jiggle

01:13:50.977 --> 01:13:53.110
* 'Cause I'm blond,
b-l-o-n-d *

01:13:53.146 --> 01:13:55.257
* 'Cause I'm a blond
Don't you wish you were me? *

01:13:55.281 --> 01:13:57.059
* I never
learned to read *

01:13:57.083 --> 01:13:58.828
* And I never learned
to cook *

01:13:58.852 --> 01:14:01.931
* Why should I bother
when I look like I look? *

01:14:01.955 --> 01:14:04.266
* I know lots of people
are smarter than me *

01:14:04.290 --> 01:14:07.090
* But I have this philosophy--
so what? *

01:14:10.396 --> 01:14:13.129
* 'Cause I'm a blond,
yeah, yeah, yeah *

01:14:13.199 --> 01:14:14.810
* I see girls without dates

01:14:14.834 --> 01:14:15.945
* And I feel
so sorry for them *

01:14:15.969 --> 01:14:18.914
* 'Cause whenever I'm around
all the men ignore them *

01:14:18.938 --> 01:14:21.383
* 'Cause I'm blond,
nyah, nyah, nyah *

01:14:21.407 --> 01:14:24.140
* 'Cause I'm a blond,
nyah, nyah, nyah *

01:14:24.878 --> 01:14:27.456
* They say to make it
you need talent and ambition *

01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:30.880
* Well, I got a TV show
and this was my audition *

01:14:31.050 --> 01:14:33.450
Um, what was it?
OK, don't tell me.

01:14:33.552 --> 01:14:35.865
Oh, yeah, OK.
"Duck, Magnum, duck!"

01:14:35.889 --> 01:14:38.622
* 'Cause I'm a blond,
yeah, yeah, yeah *

01:14:38.892 --> 01:14:41.625
* 'Cause I'm a blond,
yeah, yeah, yeah *

01:14:42.295 --> 01:14:45.140
* I took an IQ test,
and I flunked it, of course *

01:14:45.164 --> 01:14:47.342
* I can't spell "VW,"
but I got a Porsche *

01:14:47.366 --> 01:14:49.566
* 'Cause I'm a blond
b-l-o-n-d *

01:14:49.836 --> 01:14:53.082
*'Cause I'm a blond
don't you wish you were me? *

01:14:53.106 --> 01:14:54.116
* I just want to say

01:14:54.140 --> 01:14:56.451
* That being chosen
as this month's Miss August *

01:14:56.475 --> 01:14:57.787
* Is, like, a compliment
I'll remember *

01:14:57.811 --> 01:14:59.154
* For as long as I can

01:14:59.178 --> 01:15:00.155
* Right now,
I'm a freshman *

01:15:00.179 --> 01:15:01.523
* In my fourth year
at U.C.L.A. *

01:15:01.547 --> 01:15:03.358
* But my goal is
to become a veterinarian *

01:15:03.382 --> 01:15:04.982
* 'Cause I love children

01:15:05.018 --> 01:15:07.296
* 'Cause I'm a blond,
yeah, yeah, yeah *

01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:10.187
* 'Cause we're a blond,
yeah, yeah, yeah *

01:15:10.489 --> 01:15:13.368
* Girls think I'm snotty
and maybe it's true *

01:15:13.392 --> 01:15:16.038
* With my hair and body
you would be, too *

01:15:16.062 --> 01:15:18.929
* 'Cause I'm a blond,
b-l...I don't know *

01:15:19.032 --> 01:15:21.299
* I'm a blond,
yeah, yeah, yeah *

01:15:21.500 --> 01:15:24.100
* Yes, I'm a blond,

* 'Cause I'm a blond,

01:15:35.581 --> 01:15:36.314
Hey, dudes.

01:15:37.516 --> 01:15:39.161
Dudes, come on.
Snap out of it.

01:15:39.185 --> 01:15:40.852
We're making
a pit stop.

01:15:50.163 --> 01:15:50.896
Bang! Bang!

01:15:53.432 --> 01:15:54.232
Hello, Opie.

01:15:56.602 --> 01:15:58.335
Bryan, come on
over here!

01:15:59.238 --> 01:16:01.283
Will you get
in this car
right now?

01:16:01.307 --> 01:16:02.774
Mom, he's got
my gun!

01:16:04.310 --> 01:16:06.243
I told you
not to tell fibs!

01:16:07.180 --> 01:16:08.647
Hey!
Leave home, kid!

01:16:10.549 --> 01:16:11.816
Hey, dudes! Listen.

01:16:12.919 --> 01:16:14.363
Since I'm springing
for the gas,

01:16:14.387 --> 01:16:17.132
you pick up some brews
and some sandwich stuff.

01:16:17.156 --> 01:16:19.556
Some brews
and some sandwich stuff.

01:16:20.026 --> 01:16:22.626
Yeah. Like
bread and junk.
OK, dudes?

01:16:23.162 --> 01:16:23.862
OK, dude.

01:16:26.499 --> 01:16:27.499
Bread and junk.

01:16:33.006 --> 01:16:34.939
Give us bread.
We need junk.

01:16:35.574 --> 01:16:38.507
Don't shoot. Don't shoot.
I just work here.

01:16:40.079 --> 01:16:42.279
I'm an American.
There. Take it.

01:16:42.481 --> 01:16:43.281
Take it all.

01:16:45.184 --> 01:16:46.984
Where is Candy?
Candy? Oh!

01:16:49.322 --> 01:16:51.855
Right here.
Take as much as you want.

01:16:55.628 --> 01:16:57.695
Thank you.
Thank you too much.

01:17:09.675 --> 01:17:10.475
Hey, troops!

01:17:10.709 --> 01:17:12.376
Had to drain
the lizard!

01:17:12.979 --> 01:17:14.179
Be right with you.

01:17:19.052 --> 01:17:20.295
What do I
owe you?

01:17:20.319 --> 01:17:21.386
Get down!
What?

01:17:21.955 --> 01:17:22.655
Get down!

01:17:25.591 --> 01:17:26.858
I was just held up.

01:17:27.693 --> 01:17:29.371
They're out there.
They got guns!

01:17:29.395 --> 01:17:30.095
Guns?

01:17:30.496 --> 01:17:32.229
My buddies
are out there.

01:17:49.315 --> 01:17:51.582
Where are they?
That green wreck.

01:17:55.221 --> 01:17:55.921
Excuse me.

01:17:58.024 --> 01:17:59.224
Could you back up?

01:17:59.625 --> 01:18:01.558
I need to get
some unleaded.

01:18:05.564 --> 01:18:06.264
Back up.

01:18:06.332 --> 01:18:07.032
Back up.

01:18:15.608 --> 01:18:16.308
Aah!

01:18:20.079 --> 01:18:21.146
That's my wagon!

01:18:22.515 --> 01:18:23.215
Back up.

01:18:24.717 --> 01:18:25.417
* Cosmic

01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:29.698
* I was having
this out-of-body experience *

01:18:29.722 --> 01:18:31.789
* Of all these
cosmic things *

01:18:32.125 --> 01:18:34.192
* Everywhere
I went up there *

01:18:34.593 --> 01:18:36.705
* They were shakin'
their cosmic things *

01:18:36.729 --> 01:18:39.141
* Like someone gave you
a wild goose *

01:18:39.165 --> 01:18:41.343
* Or a freight train
with a loose caboose *

01:18:41.367 --> 01:18:42.711
* You better shake your

01:18:42.735 --> 01:18:43.535
* Honey buns

01:18:44.370 --> 01:18:46.081
* Shake your honey buns...

01:18:46.105 --> 01:18:48.772
We are party Martians!
We are MTV scum!

01:18:50.643 --> 01:18:52.510
* Shake
that cosmic thing *

01:18:53.112 --> 01:18:54.056
* Shake that thing

01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:54.723
* Shake it

01:18:54.747 --> 01:18:55.447
* Shake

01:18:58.251 --> 01:18:59.594
* Shake that thing
all night long *

01:18:59.618 --> 01:19:02.151
* Shake it fast,
you can't go wrong *

01:19:02.321 --> 01:19:04.666
* Don't let it rest
on the president's desk *

01:19:04.690 --> 01:19:05.757
* Rock the house

01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:08.260
* Cosmic

01:19:08.694 --> 01:19:09.561
* Woo, cosmic

01:19:12.131 --> 01:19:13.598
* Cosmic, woo...
Hey!

01:19:15.334 --> 01:19:16.467
That looks great!

01:19:17.336 --> 01:19:18.036
* Shake it

01:19:19.105 --> 01:19:19.805
* Cosmic *

01:19:22.375 --> 01:19:23.075
Hey, guys!

01:19:23.776 --> 01:19:26.043
Brunch is ready.
Come and get it.

01:19:28.347 --> 01:19:30.080
Hey, Valerie.
It's Woody.

01:19:31.117 --> 01:19:31.817
Hi.

01:19:32.151 --> 01:19:35.364
Listen, you know your friends?
Those Finland guys?

01:19:35.388 --> 01:19:36.765
We were heading
to the beach--

01:19:36.789 --> 01:19:39.322
What? They're gone?
They're with you?

01:19:39.525 --> 01:19:40.458
No. They were.

01:19:41.294 --> 01:19:44.406
They kind of robbed
the mini mart
when I wasn't lookin'.

01:19:44.430 --> 01:19:46.408
Then they totaled
the gas station.

01:19:46.432 --> 01:19:48.365
Then they ripped off
my van!

01:19:48.701 --> 01:19:50.645
I don't belive this!
Where are you?

01:19:50.669 --> 01:19:53.202
I'm at the mini mart
down the street.

01:19:53.372 --> 01:19:54.172
Toys 'R' Us.

01:19:55.141 --> 01:19:55.841
That's it?

01:19:56.509 --> 01:19:58.253
You seen Zeebo
and Wiploc?

01:19:58.277 --> 01:19:59.677
I got water
in here.

01:20:00.346 --> 01:20:02.079
Maybe that's
one of them.

01:20:02.115 --> 01:20:02.815
Sure?

01:20:03.216 --> 01:20:03.949
Not really.

01:20:04.817 --> 01:20:06.150
Good enough
for me.

01:20:07.386 --> 01:20:08.319
So look--
Uh!

01:20:10.123 --> 01:20:11.190
What's going on?

01:20:11.690 --> 01:20:12.390
Woody!

01:20:12.758 --> 01:20:13.891
What's happening?

01:20:14.627 --> 01:20:16.205
I gotta go now,
Valerie.

01:20:16.229 --> 01:20:18.096
I'm gettin'
my butt kicked.

01:20:21.234 --> 01:20:23.634
* Well, if you plan
to motor West *

01:20:28.674 --> 01:20:29.674
* Travel my way

01:20:31.210 --> 01:20:33.543
* Take a highway
that's the best *

01:20:36.615 --> 01:20:37.948
* And get your kicks

01:20:38.217 --> 01:20:39.284
* On Route 66...

01:20:41.387 --> 01:20:42.087
Aah!

01:20:44.223 --> 01:20:45.290
* Well, it winds

01:20:45.824 --> 01:20:47.291
* From Chicago to L.A.

01:20:51.364 --> 01:20:52.897
* More than 2,000 miles

01:20:54.567 --> 01:20:55.434
* All the way

01:20:57.670 --> 01:20:58.737
* Get your kicks

01:20:59.838 --> 01:21:00.705
* On Route 66

01:21:02.775 --> 01:21:03.475
Wiploc!

01:21:05.244 --> 01:21:06.488
* Well, it goes
to St. Louis *

01:21:06.512 --> 01:21:07.712
* Down to Missouri

01:21:09.648 --> 01:21:12.181
* Oklahoma City,
it's oh, so pretty *

01:21:12.585 --> 01:21:13.385
* You'll see

01:21:14.687 --> 01:21:15.387
* Amarillo

01:21:16.489 --> 01:21:17.822
* Gallup, New Mexico

01:21:19.225 --> 01:21:22.158
* Flagstaff, Arizona,
don't forget Winona *

01:21:23.929 --> 01:21:26.329
* Kingman, Barstow,
San Bernadino *

01:21:27.366 --> 01:21:30.166
* Won't you get hip
to this timely tip? *

01:21:32.571 --> 01:21:33.271
Aah!
Aah!

01:21:34.340 --> 01:21:37.073
* And you'll take
that California trip *

01:21:39.545 --> 01:21:40.245
Oh!
Oh!

01:21:41.547 --> 01:21:43.680
* Get your kicks
on Route 66 **

01:21:56.495 --> 01:21:58.340
You have the right
to remain silent.

01:21:58.364 --> 01:22:01.097
Anything you say
can and will be used...

01:22:01.767 --> 01:22:02.467
Hey!

01:22:02.768 --> 01:22:03.968
Jail isn't so bad.

01:22:04.903 --> 01:22:07.170
It's where I learned
how to surf.

01:22:09.007 --> 01:22:11.207
He's dead meat.
You hang 10 now.

01:22:11.777 --> 01:22:13.510
You've got to
believe me.

01:22:13.612 --> 01:22:14.989
This is all
a misunderstanding.

01:22:15.013 --> 01:22:15.713
Sorry.

01:22:16.482 --> 01:22:17.482
Then arrest me.

01:22:17.883 --> 01:22:18.583
Yeah.

01:22:18.884 --> 01:22:20.684
Stay out of this,
flipper.

01:22:20.919 --> 01:22:22.519
You didn't
do anything.

01:22:26.859 --> 01:22:28.592
Hey, lady!
Don't do that!

01:22:31.564 --> 01:22:32.831
Paramedic unit 104.

01:22:33.399 --> 01:22:35.910
We picked up two victims
fitting the description

01:22:35.934 --> 01:22:37.912
of the mini mart
robbery suspects.

01:22:37.936 --> 01:22:39.881
Taking them to
Our Lady of the Valley
Hospital.

01:22:39.905 --> 01:22:40.705
10-13. Copy.

01:22:42.675 --> 01:22:44.142
That's Ted's hospital.

01:22:44.477 --> 01:22:45.877
We have to get there.

01:22:46.779 --> 01:22:49.046
Joe, take us
to hospital, please.

01:22:50.916 --> 01:22:51.649
Hey, clown,

01:22:52.285 --> 01:22:54.218
you're going to
the slammer.

01:22:55.053 --> 01:22:56.653
We go
to slammer first.

01:22:57.790 --> 01:22:59.590
Give them
that love touch,

01:22:59.858 --> 01:23:01.725
then they'll
come on to me.

01:23:02.461 --> 01:23:04.461
They'll be putty
in my hands.

01:23:04.697 --> 01:23:06.508
You want sex
with Joe and Mike?

01:23:06.532 --> 01:23:08.932
No. Just so we
can get away. Do it.

01:23:19.512 --> 01:23:20.212
Hey!

01:23:20.479 --> 01:23:22.412
How about
those Lakers, huh?

01:23:25.451 --> 01:23:28.384
What about
those incredible
eyes of yours?

01:23:29.822 --> 01:23:30.522
What?

01:23:31.089 --> 01:23:32.489
They're just this far

01:23:33.559 --> 01:23:35.159
from Liz Taylor
violet.

01:23:45.671 --> 01:23:46.471
Oh, Michael!

01:23:50.676 --> 01:23:51.376
Joseph.

01:23:52.945 --> 01:23:55.023
Two new patients
in emergency...

01:23:55.047 --> 01:23:55.747
Dr. Love.

01:23:59.518 --> 01:24:02.185
* It's the summer
of love, love, love *

01:24:02.888 --> 01:24:05.421
* I'm in love
with love, love, love *

01:24:06.525 --> 01:24:08.725
* For everyone
transcends here *

01:24:10.729 --> 01:24:12.129
* I'm thinking of you

01:24:13.832 --> 01:24:14.532
* Boy *

01:24:15.834 --> 01:24:18.234
Bye, you guys.
Thanks for the lift.

01:24:18.571 --> 01:24:20.171
I hope things
work out.

01:24:20.406 --> 01:24:21.106
Bye.

01:24:21.640 --> 01:24:23.440
Happy house hunting.
Ciao.

01:24:23.542 --> 01:24:24.942
Thank you
very much.

01:24:25.143 --> 01:24:27.010
They're such
a nice couple.

01:24:28.947 --> 01:24:29.647
Bye.
Bye.

01:24:30.683 --> 01:24:31.883
Totally cool, Tim.

01:24:34.820 --> 01:24:36.887
Ride cool rips
all the way in.

01:24:39.091 --> 01:24:40.158
Great.
You two.

01:24:41.994 --> 01:24:42.861
Hi, Dr. Dude.

01:24:42.961 --> 01:24:45.028
The party's over.
Settle down.

01:24:45.063 --> 01:24:46.930
Take us
to Valerie's house.

01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:50.267
You're not setting foot
in my house again.

01:24:52.104 --> 01:24:54.171
We're looking
for two patients

01:24:54.407 --> 01:24:56.007
who were
just admitted.

01:24:56.742 --> 01:24:58.675
That's kind of
a nasty bump.

01:24:59.412 --> 01:25:00.389
Does this hurt?

01:25:00.413 --> 01:25:01.113
Aah!

01:25:01.980 --> 01:25:02.680
Good.

01:25:02.848 --> 01:25:05.581
Let's just have
a listen here, shall we?

01:25:05.751 --> 01:25:07.218
Surf's up.
Surf's up.

01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:08.920
Leave it alone.

01:25:10.823 --> 01:25:11.523
Breathe.

01:25:13.792 --> 01:25:14.492
Again.

01:25:17.563 --> 01:25:19.163
Wait a second.
Breathe.

01:25:20.699 --> 01:25:21.899
Breathe.
Breathe.

01:25:23.936 --> 01:25:25.003
It's incredible.

01:25:26.939 --> 01:25:27.806
It's amazing.

01:25:29.007 --> 01:25:29.740
You each...

01:25:30.776 --> 01:25:32.109
have two heartbeats.

01:25:32.945 --> 01:25:34.078
Wiploc and Zeebo?

01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:36.680
What are
their last names?

01:25:37.215 --> 01:25:39.060
They don't have
last names.

01:25:39.084 --> 01:25:40.795
They're performers
like...Cher.

01:25:40.819 --> 01:25:41.519
Oh!

01:25:43.155 --> 01:25:45.488
Yes. They're in
the emergency room

01:25:45.758 --> 01:25:47.736
being examined
by Dr. Gallagher.

01:25:47.760 --> 01:25:49.360
Oh! He'll
dissect them.

01:25:51.830 --> 01:25:53.297
You can't go in there.

01:25:53.799 --> 01:25:55.332
Medical personnel only.

01:25:56.635 --> 01:25:58.435
We've got to
get in there.

01:26:00.205 --> 01:26:01.950
I have an idea,
but it means

01:26:01.974 --> 01:26:05.086
doing something terrible
to an innocent person.

01:26:05.110 --> 01:26:05.910
Let's do it.

01:26:09.948 --> 01:26:10.748
Which floor?

01:26:12.117 --> 01:26:12.917
Two, please.

01:26:13.686 --> 01:26:15.886
I think I'm going to
enjoy this.

01:26:20.693 --> 01:26:22.226
Feel this?
It's a gun.

01:26:22.728 --> 01:26:23.428
What--

01:26:23.729 --> 01:26:24.662
Shut up. Walk.

01:26:26.699 --> 01:26:27.566
Come in here.

01:26:29.001 --> 01:26:30.534
Help. She's got
a gun.

01:26:31.704 --> 01:26:33.237
Take off
your uniform.

01:26:33.706 --> 01:26:34.406
What?

01:26:34.740 --> 01:26:36.073
Take it off!
Quick!

01:26:37.776 --> 01:26:40.243
I know you.
You're Ted's girlfriend.

01:26:40.646 --> 01:26:41.346
Strip.

01:26:41.413 --> 01:26:43.525
I don't want any part
of you, Ted,

01:26:43.549 --> 01:26:45.216
or your kinky
sex trips.

01:26:45.283 --> 01:26:45.983
Strip!

01:26:46.852 --> 01:26:47.852
She said strip.

01:26:52.224 --> 01:26:54.824
The call button.
Push the call button.

01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:55.660
Nuh-uh.

01:26:55.694 --> 01:26:57.827
You'll go to prison
for this...

01:26:57.963 --> 01:26:58.663
Excuse me.

01:26:58.764 --> 01:27:01.142
For molesting me,
for having a gun--

01:27:01.166 --> 01:27:02.099
It's not real.

01:27:12.678 --> 01:27:14.656
Your heart...
Excuse me, Doctor.

01:27:14.680 --> 01:27:17.813
This doctor's
here to pick up
these patients.

01:27:18.150 --> 01:27:19.193
These guys aren't
going anywhere.

01:27:19.217 --> 01:27:21.830
I'm admitting them
for observation under my care.

01:27:21.854 --> 01:27:23.187
They seem OK
to me.

01:27:23.656 --> 01:27:25.634
Nurse, listen
to their hearts,

01:27:25.658 --> 01:27:27.458
and tell me what
you hear.

01:27:29.027 --> 01:27:30.827
* Cover of
Time Magazine *

01:27:31.029 --> 01:27:32.162
* Man of the year

01:27:33.098 --> 01:27:35.365
* Yes, I'll be
rich and famous **

01:27:36.602 --> 01:27:37.546
I'll be on
the Tod show.

01:27:37.570 --> 01:27:38.970
Shh, Zeebo.
It's me.

01:27:39.838 --> 01:27:41.750
He sounds
perfectly normal
to me, Doctor.

01:27:41.774 --> 01:27:43.574
Oh, no.
That's impossible.

01:27:43.709 --> 01:27:46.376
They each have
two distinct heartbeats.

01:27:46.579 --> 01:27:47.579
Try me, Doctor.

01:27:48.246 --> 01:27:49.713
Yes.
I could try you.

01:27:56.922 --> 01:27:57.655
Oh, my God!

01:27:59.024 --> 01:27:59.724
You, too.

01:28:08.233 --> 01:28:09.233
It's my beeper!

01:28:09.735 --> 01:28:12.402
No. My beeper's never
done this before.

01:28:12.705 --> 01:28:13.638
Get the phone.

01:28:14.607 --> 01:28:15.940
What phone,
doctor?

01:28:18.844 --> 01:28:19.544
Hello?

01:28:20.245 --> 01:28:23.445
Doctor, I'm afraid
you must be
hearing things.

01:28:25.851 --> 01:28:26.718
Yodel-aydi...

01:28:28.153 --> 01:28:29.286
Yodel-ay-hee-hoo!

01:28:29.387 --> 01:28:31.232
Is there something
wrong, Doctor?

01:28:31.256 --> 01:28:34.035
Oh, hello, Doctor.
Should I call you
a doctor, Doctor?

01:28:34.059 --> 01:28:34.926
Make it stop!

01:28:37.062 --> 01:28:38.195
I can't stand it.

01:28:51.209 --> 01:28:53.209
You guys,
you came this close

01:28:53.646 --> 01:28:55.513
to being
a science project.

01:28:56.014 --> 01:28:56.714
Come on.

01:28:57.249 --> 01:28:58.649
Ted's car! Follow me.

01:29:01.386 --> 01:29:02.719
Quick! Get in quick!

01:29:04.022 --> 01:29:05.955
Oh! Oh, God!
Here comes Ted!

01:29:07.392 --> 01:29:09.059
Hide!
Get down and hide.

01:29:13.198 --> 01:29:13.898
Valerie?

01:29:14.432 --> 01:29:16.377
Sweetheart, I'm
so glad to see you.

01:29:16.401 --> 01:29:17.401
Can we go home?

01:29:17.903 --> 01:29:20.303
These last two days
have been hell.

01:29:21.674 --> 01:29:24.719
Sweetheart, I actually think
I've been hearing things.

01:29:24.743 --> 01:29:26.476
Oh, Val,
could you drive?

01:29:26.912 --> 01:29:27.979
Please, Valerie.

01:29:28.080 --> 01:29:29.080
OK, Ted.
Here.

01:29:30.182 --> 01:29:31.115
Get in, honey.

01:29:31.784 --> 01:29:32.717
I'm exhausted.

01:29:33.719 --> 01:29:35.786
I thought
about what you said.

01:29:36.121 --> 01:29:38.788
I've decided
to do something impulsive.

01:29:38.924 --> 01:29:41.002
Let's go to Vegas tonight
and get married.

01:29:41.026 --> 01:29:41.726
Tonight?

01:29:42.761 --> 01:29:45.161
What about the church
and my dress?

01:29:45.998 --> 01:29:48.665
We can do the big
church wedding later.

01:29:49.201 --> 01:29:49.901
Well...

01:29:51.136 --> 01:29:52.203
what do you say?

01:29:53.171 --> 01:29:55.771
I don't know...
I'm just so surprised.

01:29:56.074 --> 01:29:58.141
Come on.
You wanted surprises.

01:29:59.812 --> 01:30:00.512
Ted.

01:30:22.400 --> 01:30:23.467
You got to bring

01:30:24.402 --> 01:30:26.269
that one-piece
night thing,

01:30:26.404 --> 01:30:27.471
that, uh, corset

01:30:28.006 --> 01:30:29.806
that looks
like underwear.

01:30:39.317 --> 01:30:41.517
What is it now?
Something old...

01:30:43.155 --> 01:30:45.088
Oh! These pantyhose
are old.

01:30:45.390 --> 01:30:46.323
Something new.

01:30:47.425 --> 01:30:48.558
This veil is new.

01:30:51.463 --> 01:30:52.796
Dr. Tushman, please.

01:30:55.033 --> 01:30:56.566
Hey, Barbara, Ted here.

01:30:56.769 --> 01:30:59.369
Listen, uh, I need
a really big favor.

01:30:59.537 --> 01:31:01.149
I want you
to cover my shift

01:31:01.173 --> 01:31:04.240
at the hospital tomorrow.
I'm going to Vegas.

01:31:04.943 --> 01:31:06.343
Well, I'm going to...

01:31:06.945 --> 01:31:09.412
lose a little money,
take in a show,

01:31:09.982 --> 01:31:11.049
and get married.

01:31:11.383 --> 01:31:12.650
Barbara.
Barbara--

01:31:16.054 --> 01:31:18.366
Look, just because
I'm getting married

01:31:18.390 --> 01:31:20.990
doesn't mean we can't date,
all right?

01:31:21.359 --> 01:31:22.059
What?

01:31:35.373 --> 01:31:36.073
Valerie.

01:31:38.243 --> 01:31:39.243
Good-bye.
Bye.

01:31:40.145 --> 01:31:43.478
Nice planet
you have here.
Give Tanya my number.

01:31:43.849 --> 01:31:44.982
Take care, Zeebo.

01:31:47.853 --> 01:31:48.586
Aw, Wiploc.

01:31:49.154 --> 01:31:51.399
I think I'll miss you
least of all.

01:31:51.423 --> 01:31:53.290
You got liplock
for Wiploc?

01:31:55.327 --> 01:31:56.027
Valerie...

01:31:58.296 --> 01:31:59.896
I don't know
the words.

01:32:00.498 --> 01:32:01.198
Oh, Mac.

01:32:01.466 --> 01:32:03.533
I'm going to
miss you so much.

01:32:05.237 --> 01:32:06.504
I'll miss you, too.

01:32:07.539 --> 01:32:11.472
Sweetheart, I booked
the Cave Man Suite
at Cupid's Lodge.

01:32:15.480 --> 01:32:17.013
What the hell
is this?

01:32:18.283 --> 01:32:20.216
OK, Ted,
they're not a band.

01:32:21.954 --> 01:32:23.887
They're from
another planet.

01:32:24.089 --> 01:32:26.689
Go back in the house.
I'll be in soon.

01:32:26.992 --> 01:32:28.859
Oh, my God!
They're aliens.

01:32:29.427 --> 01:32:31.094
Aliens!
Got you covered.

01:32:31.529 --> 01:32:33.396
It's OK.
Ted. Ted. It's OK.

01:32:36.501 --> 01:32:37.834
You're contaminated.

01:32:40.205 --> 01:32:41.182
I--I have
to go now.

01:32:41.206 --> 01:32:43.006
Ted!
I'll call the police.

01:32:44.009 --> 01:32:45.409
I gotta go.
Stop it.

01:32:54.352 --> 01:32:55.552
Good-bye, Valerie.

01:33:14.106 --> 01:33:14.806
Mac!

01:33:16.141 --> 01:33:17.141
It didn't work!

01:33:18.977 --> 01:33:19.677
Mac!

01:33:20.112 --> 01:33:22.112
I have to tell you
something.

01:33:22.447 --> 01:33:24.447
I love you!
Take me with you!

01:33:25.050 --> 01:33:25.850
To Jhazalla?

01:33:27.019 --> 01:33:27.719
Anyplace!

01:33:28.653 --> 01:33:29.653
I am Mr. Right?

01:33:30.923 --> 01:33:31.623
Yes!
Yes!

01:33:39.331 --> 01:33:41.131
Well, uh...
good-bye, Ted.

01:33:41.934 --> 01:33:44.267
Um, I guess
it wasn't meant to be,

01:33:44.336 --> 01:33:46.736
but, uh, I really
want to thank you

01:33:47.239 --> 01:33:49.372
for, um...thanks
for the, uh...

01:33:52.110 --> 01:33:53.043
Good-bye, Ted.

01:33:59.717 --> 01:34:00.417
Mac!

01:34:15.467 --> 01:34:16.167
Mac!

01:34:19.071 --> 01:34:22.604
Wait, you guys!
You can't leave
without Margaritas!

01:34:30.248 --> 01:34:32.181
Valerie,
what are you doing?

01:34:34.352 --> 01:34:36.330
Good-bye, Candy.
I'll miss you.

01:34:36.354 --> 01:34:37.754
Well, good luck, Val.

01:34:39.257 --> 01:34:39.957
Call me.

01:34:46.198 --> 01:34:47.065
Happy trails.

01:34:50.668 --> 01:34:52.001
Bambi, I never knew.

01:34:53.771 --> 01:34:54.471
Wait!

01:35:01.746 --> 01:35:02.446
Hey!

01:35:04.449 --> 01:35:06.116
Give my love
to Finland!

01:35:18.296 --> 01:35:19.429
Oh! Oh! Ha ha ha!
