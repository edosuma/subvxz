<i>Previously on</i> The O.C.<i>:</i>

00:03.480 --> 00:04.833
My dad is in real-estate development. 

00:05.000 --> 00:06.228
You guys built the mall?

00:07.080 --> 00:08.877
I'm in charge of residential development.

00:09.040 --> 00:11.759
- Ryan and I aren't here together.
- We're done.

00:11.920 --> 00:13.876
Go after her, tell her how you feel.
It's easy.

00:14.040 --> 00:15.632
Do you want to do something tonight?

00:15.800 --> 00:17.028
I'm taking you with me.

00:17.200 --> 00:20.237
You can start over.
You can start a new life.

00:20.400 --> 00:22.834
Or I see you and the girls
in about eight to 10 years.

00:23.000 --> 00:24.353
Who's the bitch?

00:24.520 --> 00:26.192
Call an ambulance, somebody!

00:27.720 --> 00:28.914
You're gonna be okay.

00:32.360 --> 00:35.989
Are we worried your dad won't love us
if we don't feed him enough?

00:36.160 --> 00:38.754
All right. Starting now,
no more digs at my dad.

00:38.920 --> 00:40.797
Honey, that wasn't a dig. Seth?

00:40.960 --> 00:44.157
No. When you called him
a heartless bastard, that was a dig.

00:44.320 --> 00:46.470
You sold me out.

00:48.200 --> 00:50.919
See, they're like puppets
and I'm the puppet master.

00:51.080 --> 00:53.310
World domination to follow.

00:53.480 --> 00:56.711
Maybe you guys can make peace
this weekend.

00:56.880 --> 00:58.199
Okay.

00:58.360 --> 01:01.033
Oh, no, wait. We can't.

01:01.200 --> 01:03.668
- Why?
- I'm still Jewish.

01:03.840 --> 01:06.912
Just getting it out of my system,
I promise.

01:07.320 --> 01:11.108
- I wonder what his new girlfriend's like.
- I am sure she is very well-paid.

01:12.040 --> 01:14.235
I am on fire.

01:14.400 --> 01:16.072
Look at you, you're wired.

01:16.240 --> 01:18.959
Seeing your parents should make
you feel guilt, not terror.

01:19.120 --> 01:21.156
Don't forget, I'm also her boss.

01:21.320 --> 01:22.469
Dad.

01:22.640 --> 01:26.997
Speak of the devil, and the devil,
he doth appear. <i>Shalom</i>, Sandy.

01:27.880 --> 01:30.030
- How long have you been here?
- Not long.

01:30.200 --> 01:32.634
The Learjet got here quick.
I used my key to get in.

01:32.800 --> 01:34.597
So, Caleb, where's your new girlfriend?

01:34.760 --> 01:37.433
She's taking a swim.
Where's my grandson?

01:38.000 --> 01:41.595
So your grandpa,
he basically owns Newport, right?

01:41.760 --> 01:45.753
Yes. And, like you, he comes from humble
beginnings. You'll probably hit it off.

01:45.920 --> 01:47.592
I burned down one of his homes.

01:47.760 --> 01:51.673
But it was an accident. He owns a million
of them. It's not even on his radar.

01:51.840 --> 01:54.513
Hey, seriously, do not worry about it.
Okay, look.

01:54.680 --> 01:58.559
He lets Mom run the company, he's got
a brand-new girlfriend, he's very mellow.

01:58.720 --> 02:00.153
- Seth.
- Hey.

02:00.320 --> 02:01.912
Hey.

02:02.560 --> 02:03.959
How you doing?

02:04.120 --> 02:06.111
You're still not a football player.

02:06.280 --> 02:09.989
Yes. No. But thank you.
Grandpa, meet my friend Ryan.

02:10.160 --> 02:12.594
This is the kid that
burned down my house.

02:12.760 --> 02:14.557
Come on.

02:14.720 --> 02:16.438
So you gotta see my pictures
from Spain.

02:16.600 --> 02:20.593
And you've got to promise me to go
to Barcelona while you're still young.

02:20.760 --> 02:23.877
You wanna take those
and put them around by the grill?

02:24.040 --> 02:25.473
Hey.

- Hi.
- Hi.

03:01.360 --> 03:02.873
I'm Gabrielle.

03:03.960 --> 03:05.154
I'm with Caleb.

03:09.680 --> 03:13.229
Oh, my God,
that could be my grandma.

03:56.600 --> 04:00.229
Is it twisted to find
my potential grandma really hot?

04:00.960 --> 04:03.520
Not when she looks like that.

04:03.680 --> 04:05.432
- Gabrielle.
- Yeah?

04:05.600 --> 04:08.239
We're gonna sit, drink some wine,
catch up.

04:08.400 --> 04:09.958
Okay. Do you want me to...?

04:10.120 --> 04:14.238
Hang out in the sun. Get some color.
Try to stay out of trouble.

04:16.519 --> 04:18.636
Can I join you guys?

04:18.800 --> 04:21.108
- Yeah. No...
- Yeah, come on...

04:25.560 --> 04:27.118
It's warm.

04:30.360 --> 04:32.237
So, what's up?

04:32.400 --> 04:35.119
- We were... We were talking about the...
- You were...

04:35.280 --> 04:37.157
He was telling me about the thing.

04:37.320 --> 04:40.995
So this birthday party for Caleb,
it's, like, a who's who of Newport?

04:41.160 --> 04:43.071
Should be wild, huh?

04:44.560 --> 04:48.314
- I'm being sarcastic.
- We don't get a lot of that around here.

04:48.480 --> 04:49.833
So who are you guys bringing?

04:50.000 --> 04:52.230
- I would say no one, really.
- Yeah. The same.

04:52.400 --> 04:55.710
You're kidding, right?
There are no girls you wanna bring?

04:55.880 --> 04:57.791
Two young, hot guys like yourselves?

04:58.440 --> 05:00.396
- Are you still being sarcastic?
- No.

05:00.560 --> 05:04.189
- Her name is Summer.
- And? Did you invite her yet?

05:04.360 --> 05:07.716
- It's not that simple, I mean...
- She can't say yes if you don't ask her.

05:09.280 --> 05:10.554
That is very wise, Gabby.

05:11.160 --> 05:13.469
- What about you?
- Did you ask Marissa?

05:13.640 --> 05:15.995
I haven't talked to her.
I don't think she'll want to.

05:16.160 --> 05:17.957
And why not?

05:18.120 --> 05:21.556
Her family's kind of falling apart...

05:21.720 --> 05:24.996
...she's got this boyfriend she may be
back with. It's a long story.

05:25.160 --> 05:27.674
- They've been going out since fifth grade.
- Fifth grade?

05:27.840 --> 05:31.753
Okay, she needs to change it up. She's
known that guy since he was eating paste.

05:32.960 --> 05:34.473
I think he still does.

05:38.240 --> 05:40.196
Hey, babe. You decent?

05:40.360 --> 05:42.430
Hey. What are you doing here?

05:42.600 --> 05:45.956
I just came from the doctor's,
got my stitches out.

05:46.120 --> 05:47.599
Thought we could hit the beach.

05:47.760 --> 05:50.957
Don't you think it's too soon?
You should probably go home and rest.

05:51.120 --> 05:54.112
No, no. That's all I've been doing.

05:54.280 --> 05:56.032
Luke, you got shot.

05:56.200 --> 05:57.633
Yeah, I know.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.719
I know how lucky I am
to have a second chance.

06:03.880 --> 06:06.792
That's why I don't wanna
waste any more time.

06:08.160 --> 06:09.752
What do you mean?

06:17.200 --> 06:20.954
I've been an idiot. I never should have
broken up with you in the first place.

06:21.120 --> 06:23.554
And now, with everything
that's going on with your dad...

06:23.720 --> 06:26.632
The thing is, you were there for me
when I was in the hospital.

06:26.800 --> 06:29.439
And now I wanna be here for you.

06:35.080 --> 06:36.832
It's all just been so crazy.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.197
I just wish we could be together,
like it was.

06:43.920 --> 06:47.037
I... I don't know.

06:49.040 --> 06:51.713
You don't have to.
I mean, we can take it slow.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.117
Tell you what.
Let's just hang out here today.

06:58.280 --> 07:02.239
We'll sit by the pool or
watch a movie or something.

07:03.120 --> 07:05.111
Whatever you want.

07:06.440 --> 07:07.873
Okay.

07:14.600 --> 07:16.909
Gabrielle, she seems...

07:17.080 --> 07:18.957
She's 24.

07:19.120 --> 07:20.553
I'm sorry?

07:20.720 --> 07:23.473
Oh, she seems so mature for her age.

07:24.480 --> 07:27.119
These birthday festivities,
we're keeping them small, right?

07:27.280 --> 07:31.592
- It depends what you mean by "small."
- Just the family, the four of us. Gabrielle.

07:31.760 --> 07:33.716
Right. The four of us.

07:33.880 --> 07:36.952
Gabrielle, Ryan
and 150 of your closest friends.

07:37.120 --> 07:40.192
Cal, she's been working overtime on this.
The menus, the invitations.

07:40.360 --> 07:42.112
On top of all her other work.

07:42.280 --> 07:44.236
- Is it too much?
- No. Work is great.

07:44.400 --> 07:47.995
- The new development's back on track.
- After your boy nearly burned it down.

07:48.760 --> 07:51.991
We've had setbacks, but the insurance
more than covered the damages.

07:52.160 --> 07:56.472
I hear you've commissioned an architect
I've never approved to do the redesign.

07:56.640 --> 07:59.279
Yes, but I would never build
without consulting you.

07:59.440 --> 08:01.715
Honey, you don't need my approval.

08:02.240 --> 08:05.312
After all, you adopted the boy
without consulting me.

08:08.120 --> 08:11.112
I would have called you about Ryan,
but there wasn't enough time.

08:11.280 --> 08:14.477
I'm pushing you too hard.
Things are slipping through the cracks.

08:14.640 --> 08:18.713
Which is why I've decided to
scale back your responsibilities.

08:18.880 --> 08:21.633
- You're demoting me?
- I wanna get more involved.

08:21.800 --> 08:25.475
Give you a chance to spend a bit more
time with your new family, your new son.

08:25.640 --> 08:28.996
Now, then.
Tell me all about Jimmy Cooper.

08:29.160 --> 08:31.310
Son of a bitch lost $4 million?

08:36.960 --> 08:40.077
I took Kaitlin by the stables
to say goodbye to China.

08:40.640 --> 08:42.914
Guess she won't be
needing these anymore.

08:45.480 --> 08:48.040
You know, I think China
was her best friend.

08:48.200 --> 08:50.794
- China's a horse.
- Maybe to you.

08:50.960 --> 08:53.030
Hey, you know...

08:53.480 --> 08:56.438
- I don't feel good about this.
- Well, you shouldn't.

08:56.600 --> 09:01.037
What do you...?
What do you want from me?

09:04.680 --> 09:06.272
I think I want a divorce.

09:14.560 --> 09:17.199
I'm sorry, honey.

09:17.360 --> 09:19.476
I just don't see any other way.

09:27.120 --> 09:29.998
- Hey.
- I was on my way to work.

09:30.160 --> 09:32.469
- We hadn't talked in a while.
- I was gonna call you.

09:32.640 --> 09:36.519
No, it's cool. So Kirsten's dad's
in town, they're having this...

09:36.680 --> 09:38.159
Hey.

09:39.720 --> 09:41.950
- Hi.
- Hey, how you doing, man?

09:42.120 --> 09:43.599
Fine.

09:43.760 --> 09:49.471
Yeah, I never got a chance to
thank you for taking me to the hospital...

09:49.640 --> 09:51.870
...and giving Marissa a call.

09:54.680 --> 09:56.671
Yeah, no problem.

09:56.840 --> 09:59.673
Do you have some aspirin?
My arm's killing me from the stitches.

09:59.840 --> 10:04.755
- Yeah, check in my parents' bathroom.
- All right, thanks. Hey, take it easy, guy.

10:08.840 --> 10:10.273
So, what's going on?

10:11.800 --> 10:15.031
I was gonna see if you wanted to...

10:15.960 --> 10:17.518
I was gonna see how you were doing.

10:17.680 --> 10:20.069
You seem to be doing good...

10:21.280 --> 10:23.555
...so I'm gonna get to work. Later.

10:33.680 --> 10:35.193
Hey.

10:36.200 --> 10:37.872
Hi.

10:38.040 --> 10:39.871
Seth and Caleb are sailing.

10:40.840 --> 10:44.515
I've never seen two people
more excited about boats.

10:46.800 --> 10:49.951
Seth said you worked here,
and I could use a cocktail.

10:52.800 --> 10:56.190
- I can't serve you.
- Right. You're not legal.

10:57.720 --> 11:01.156
- How about a cranberry juice?
- That I can do.

11:03.280 --> 11:06.590
From the flight. I hate flying.

11:06.760 --> 11:10.469
- You?
- I've never been on a plane.

11:11.720 --> 11:13.278
My first time, I was 15.

11:13.440 --> 11:16.512
My mother sent me to Japan
all by myself to do some modeling.

11:17.040 --> 11:19.713
She figured it was easier
than her having to get a job.

11:19.880 --> 11:22.713
- I can relate.
- I've heard.

11:26.640 --> 11:28.870
So how'd the modeling thing turn out?

11:29.040 --> 11:32.828
Well, when you're a teenager and you're
living in a house with a bunch of girls...

11:33.000 --> 11:35.992
...with no parents,
things can get a little insane.

11:37.640 --> 11:41.155
By the time I got clean, I was 22,
retirement age.

11:46.600 --> 11:50.275
You must think it's weird,
me with an older guy.

11:52.120 --> 11:54.111
I live in a pool house.

11:58.080 --> 12:00.469
So how did it work out with your girl?

12:01.360 --> 12:03.874
- Paste-eater?
- They have a past.

12:04.440 --> 12:06.192
Excuse me? More water.

12:15.840 --> 12:17.990
Oh, Kirsten, come on, honey.

12:18.160 --> 12:21.152
You could not have
done more or done better.

12:21.320 --> 12:24.995
I just don't understand. I've worked
so hard for him. I've killed myself for him.

12:25.160 --> 12:29.950
Well, the man is a bottomless pit of need.
You think you can fill it? You can't.

12:33.560 --> 12:35.790
You're amazing.

12:35.960 --> 12:38.155
If he can't appreciate you, screw him.

12:38.320 --> 12:40.914
Quit. Quit.

12:41.080 --> 12:44.709
You've never supported me working
for him. You've never liked him.

12:44.880 --> 12:48.668
You're right. Not since our wedding day,
when you walked yourself down the aisle.

12:48.840 --> 12:50.910
He was in Singapore.
There was a monsoon.

12:51.080 --> 12:53.469
Baby, we changed the date three times
for his schedule.

12:53.640 --> 12:56.074
He makes the world revolve around him,
including you.

12:56.240 --> 12:58.196
Sandy, he's my dad.

12:58.360 --> 13:01.636
He's ruining your life. Quit.

13:03.760 --> 13:05.637
I can't.

13:08.360 --> 13:12.592
So you're living in a pool house.
And then? So, what's next for you?

13:12.760 --> 13:15.433
What's next for you?
Learjet to London, Paris in the fall?

13:15.600 --> 13:16.828
Perhaps.

13:19.760 --> 13:21.637
I'll be right back.

13:24.600 --> 13:26.272
- Hi.
- Hey.

13:26.920 --> 13:28.069
Got a minute?

13:34.240 --> 13:35.878
What's up?

13:36.480 --> 13:40.519
- I wanted to talk to you before, but...
- Luke was there.

13:40.680 --> 13:42.159
Right.

13:47.400 --> 13:49.675
He wants to get back together.

13:50.920 --> 13:54.913
- What did you tell him?
- I told him I needed to think about it.

14:00.760 --> 14:02.079
I don't know what I should do.

14:05.360 --> 14:07.396
I don't know either.

14:08.280 --> 14:09.474
I know. I just...

14:09.640 --> 14:12.029
Look, if you came here for me
to help you choose...

14:12.200 --> 14:15.078
- Of course not...
- Good.

14:18.560 --> 14:22.758
Why don't you just let me know
when you've made up your mind. Okay?

14:28.280 --> 14:29.793
Okay.

14:40.040 --> 14:43.350
If he'd just said something.
I mean, I just wanted him to say anything.

14:43.520 --> 14:45.397
Well, you can't expect him
to choose, Coop.

14:45.560 --> 14:48.518
He comes from a place where they have
knife fights, drag racing...

14:48.680 --> 14:51.717
...and sex on the hood of a car.
- That's from <i>Fast and the Furious</i>.

14:51.880 --> 14:54.599
- That movie was based on a true story.
- No, it wasn't.

14:54.760 --> 14:58.594
Whatevs. All I'm saying is you have
to do the choosing, not him or Luke.

15:13.800 --> 15:16.678
It's fate. It's destiny.
Look, we both like burritos.

15:16.840 --> 15:18.831
You wanna eat somewhere else?

15:19.000 --> 15:21.639
Who's winning right now,
me or my hair?

15:25.960 --> 15:27.837
I'm gonna get us some salsa.

15:29.720 --> 15:31.870
Hi, Summer.

15:32.040 --> 15:33.712
Seth Cohen.

15:35.200 --> 15:37.953
Could you give me a hand...

15:38.120 --> 15:40.111
...over here?

15:47.400 --> 15:49.118
Okay.

15:49.280 --> 15:52.192
I... I know you gotta figure
some stuff out. I get that.

15:52.360 --> 15:56.831
But in the meantime, there's this party
at... Well, it's for Seth's grandfather.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.911
I know. I'm going.

15:59.080 --> 16:01.196
Luke asked me this morning.

16:04.840 --> 16:09.516
Cool. Well, I'll see
you and Luke tomorrow, then.

16:12.440 --> 16:14.351
Yeah. See you.

16:15.880 --> 16:18.599
Two salsa verdes. Aggressive.

16:18.760 --> 16:20.796
Pico de gallo, that's a classic.

16:20.960 --> 16:23.793
Holy jalape Ío. Somebody came to play.

16:23.960 --> 16:26.599
Are there any napkins?

16:27.920 --> 16:29.592
No.

16:29.760 --> 16:31.671
- Lick it.
- What?

16:31.840 --> 16:34.115
I just got my nails done.
It'll ruin the polish.

16:34.280 --> 16:38.114
- You lick it.
- I don't like picante. It's for Marissa.

16:43.200 --> 16:44.679
- Thanks.
- It's good.

16:44.840 --> 16:47.718
Now, aren't you gonna invite me
to your grandpa's party?

16:49.120 --> 16:51.190
I'm sorry, Summer,
could you please repeat that?

16:51.360 --> 16:54.750
Your grandpa's having this
awesome party. It's at your house.

16:54.920 --> 16:57.275
And I thought we were friends.

16:57.440 --> 17:00.876
Wait a second. Do you want me to ask
you because you wanna go with me...

17:01.040 --> 17:04.077
...or just because you wanna go?

17:04.319 --> 17:06.071
Fair enough. I'll see you at 8.

17:07.079 --> 17:09.640
- Hey.
- Hey. How was court?

17:09.800 --> 17:13.474
I was distracted all day. I was thinking,
if you quit, know what we could do?

17:13.640 --> 17:15.392
- I'm not quitting.
- Hear me out.

17:15.560 --> 17:18.313
We could buy back our old house
in Berkeley.

17:18.480 --> 17:20.516
You loved that house.
Seth loved that house.

17:20.680 --> 17:22.875
That house had bad plumbing
and termites.

17:23.040 --> 17:25.109
It was a fixer-upper we never got
to fix up.

17:25.280 --> 17:26.269
I know.

17:26.440 --> 17:29.637
We moved here because your mom
got sick. We never planned to stay.

17:29.800 --> 17:33.349
If you quit, we could do anything
we want. We could go anywhere.

17:33.520 --> 17:35.078
No, we can't.

17:35.240 --> 17:39.552
Why not? Seth has been planning
his exodus from this place since he was 6.

17:39.720 --> 17:40.994
Ryan wouldn't care.

17:41.160 --> 17:44.357
You could get that little gallery
in Sausalito you've always dreamed of.

17:44.520 --> 17:47.273
Or the Mission. You could put
your art history degree to use.

17:47.440 --> 17:49.317
I haven't thought about
that gallery in years.

17:49.480 --> 17:51.232
So...

17:52.360 --> 17:54.191
...think about it.

17:56.200 --> 17:57.599
Think about it.

17:57.760 --> 18:00.672
Is this too slutty to wear
to an old guy's birthday party?

18:00.840 --> 18:02.592
I don't want the dude
to have a coronary.

18:02.760 --> 18:05.115
I can't believe
you're actually going with Seth.

18:05.280 --> 18:09.159
Aloha? Caleb Nichol is, like,
the Donald Trump of the West.

18:09.320 --> 18:10.753
Do you know how many hot, rich...

18:10.920 --> 18:13.957
...twenty-something banker-brokers
are gonna be there?

18:14.120 --> 18:16.953
A lot. And now I have someone
to introduce me to them.

18:17.120 --> 18:19.793
- Isn't that a little mean to Seth?
- To who?

18:20.960 --> 18:22.473
Kidding.

18:24.040 --> 18:25.712
That was delicious, Kirsten.

18:25.880 --> 18:28.030
Well, thank you.
I order from them all the time.

18:28.200 --> 18:30.236
Less time at work,
more time for cooking.

18:30.400 --> 18:33.790
Because there's no place Kirsten feels
more comfortable than in the kitchen.

18:33.960 --> 18:36.599
- What? Mom can't even make cereal.
- Thanks, Seth.

18:36.760 --> 18:39.035
- I love you, Mom.
- I love you too.

18:39.720 --> 18:43.235
You have a quick wit, Seth.
Amazing you're not better at skirt-chasing.

18:45.720 --> 18:50.350
Well, if by "skirts" you mean girls,
in your outdated cowboy-speak...

18:50.520 --> 18:54.274
...I have a little news for you. Turns out
somebody has a date to your party.

18:56.200 --> 19:00.352
And it's not a big deal or anything,
but if you must know, Summer asked me.

19:00.520 --> 19:04.957
- Summer. Summer's hot.
- You did not just say that.

19:05.120 --> 19:07.680
- Say what?
- Just go, please.

19:07.840 --> 19:09.432
You go.

19:12.320 --> 19:14.231
What about you, Ryan?

19:17.480 --> 19:19.948
Nope. Going by myself.

19:31.840 --> 19:35.355
Caleb seems to be in good spirits.
He just finished a second bottle of merlot.

19:35.520 --> 19:39.069
- Now would be a good time to talk to him.
- I'm not ready for that conversation.

19:39.240 --> 19:40.832
What conversation?

19:41.000 --> 19:42.911
- Got any grappa?
- Yeah.

19:43.080 --> 19:45.548
- Are you adopting another kid?
- It's nothing.

19:45.720 --> 19:48.473
- Actually, it's something.
- I've never known my daughter...

19:48.640 --> 19:51.598
...to need someone to speak for her.
- Maybe you've never gotten to know her.

19:51.760 --> 19:54.752
If you did, you'd know she's the best
thing that ever happened to your company.

19:54.920 --> 19:57.309
You'd support her,
not demote her so she wants to quit.

19:57.480 --> 19:59.596
- Is that true? You wanna quit?
- No...

19:59.760 --> 20:01.955
- Kirsten.
- We were talking...

20:02.120 --> 20:06.113
About selling this house and moving back
to Berkeley, like we'd always planned.

20:06.280 --> 20:09.875
You're not serious. You're still
smoking the weed, aren't you?

20:10.040 --> 20:11.678
- Dad...
- Dad, you smoke weed?

20:11.840 --> 20:14.912
- Out, now. Private conversation.
- Ryan, guess who's a stoner.

20:15.080 --> 20:16.752
Honey, don't be afraid of him.

20:16.920 --> 20:20.310
You keep your mouth shut.
No one here cares what you think.

20:20.480 --> 20:22.596
Don't talk to me like that
in my own house.

20:22.760 --> 20:26.275
Whose house is this? Who built it?
Who paid for it?

20:26.440 --> 20:28.158
- Dad.
- This is between you and me, Kiki.

20:28.320 --> 20:29.958
You're gonna do what you want anyway.

20:30.120 --> 20:33.715
- Should we maybe go?
- Adopting juvenile delinquents.

20:33.880 --> 20:35.552
- Maybe let's just...
- Yeah, let's.

20:35.720 --> 20:38.518
You're making a big deal of this.
It was nothing.

20:38.760 --> 20:40.830
Doesn't sound like nothing.

20:41.320 --> 20:45.757
In fact, thanks, Sandy,
for letting me know how she feels.

20:45.920 --> 20:49.469
She would never tell me that.
She never tells me anything.

20:49.640 --> 20:52.996
If you wanna quit, that's fine.
I'll expect your resignation tomorrow.

20:53.520 --> 20:55.397
Now, then. The grappa.

20:57.160 --> 21:02.029
So, Gabrielle, I heard Grandpa's taking
you on the helicopter tour tomorrow.

21:02.200 --> 21:06.591
Yeah. He wants to show me
his Orange County empire.

21:06.760 --> 21:10.036
- This game sucks.
- Let me see it.

21:13.240 --> 21:15.674
Ryan, you've been playing
the pirate game?

21:15.840 --> 21:17.796
That's a little bit minty.

21:17.960 --> 21:21.236
- What else do you have?
- I'll go get you "Pro Skater 3." It's good.

21:22.120 --> 21:25.476
Hey. We gotta go searching
for my dad's bong later, all right?

21:29.240 --> 21:30.719
So...

21:31.640 --> 21:34.598
...does he always yell like that?
- Pretty much.

21:34.760 --> 21:39.470
He's the boss, and every relationship
is a business relationship to him.

21:39.960 --> 21:41.632
Even yours?

21:43.240 --> 21:45.470
He'll only ever really love one woman.

21:45.640 --> 21:48.677
And she passed away years ago.

21:49.160 --> 21:51.549
For now, he's just looking
to stay entertained...

21:52.000 --> 21:54.594
...keep from being bored.

21:55.440 --> 21:56.793
But aren't we all?

22:06.240 --> 22:08.356
I am so bored.

22:12.040 --> 22:14.429
- Do you think...?
- Don't think.

22:27.560 --> 22:29.073
Gabrielle.

22:29.240 --> 22:31.356
We're leaving. Now.

22:38.800 --> 22:40.756
Back to the office.

22:57.640 --> 23:00.871
- How's Gabrielle?
- I don't know.

23:01.040 --> 23:02.792
Oh, really?

23:02.960 --> 23:06.589
Okay, Ryan, let me present
exhibit A to you.

23:06.760 --> 23:09.593
She opted to forgo sailing
to go to the Crab Shack?

23:10.120 --> 23:11.838
So? Not everyone likes sailing.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.434
Okay. Let's take it to exhibit B here.

23:15.600 --> 23:19.991
Intense, some would even say smoldering,
eye contact at the table.

23:20.160 --> 23:22.913
She was mad-dogging you.
And finally, the clincher...

23:23.080 --> 23:25.548
...last night in the pool house,
she chose to sit on your bed...

23:25.720 --> 23:27.517
...even though there was an empty chair.

23:27.680 --> 23:31.229
Come on, boys, out of the pool.
Caterers are here. Time to get ready.

23:32.040 --> 23:34.076
I would like some answers.

23:34.960 --> 23:36.916
Yeah, okay, we hooked up.

23:37.520 --> 23:40.080
- What?
- Isn't that what you were asking?

23:40.240 --> 23:43.994
I noticed some heavy flirting, yes...

23:44.160 --> 23:45.798
You hooked up with my grandma?

23:48.000 --> 23:51.879
- Actually, that's kind of hot. How was it?
- No one can know about this.

23:52.040 --> 23:54.031
I agree completely. How was it?

23:54.200 --> 23:55.872
It was good.

23:56.520 --> 23:58.988
Weird, but good.

24:01.920 --> 24:05.993
- What about Marissa?
- What about her?

24:12.680 --> 24:15.717
'73 Dom. Yes, that's his favorite.
Thank you.

24:20.320 --> 24:21.958
Is there cilantro in that?

24:22.120 --> 24:23.553
Great, he hates it.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.230
I can't believe
you still went through with this.

24:27.400 --> 24:31.393
I had no choice, even though you tried
to sabotage the entire weekend.

24:31.560 --> 24:35.155
Honey, I'm sorry I jumped the gun
last night. Ready?

24:36.760 --> 24:38.193
- Hello.
- Hi.

24:38.360 --> 24:40.271
- Dad, you made it.
- How you doing?

24:40.440 --> 24:42.431
- Disappointed?
- No.

24:42.600 --> 24:44.636
- Sandy.
- Hey, happy birthday, Caleb.

24:44.800 --> 24:47.314
- Can I get you a drink?
- Absolutely.

24:48.360 --> 24:50.999
- Dad, happy birthday.
- Thanks.

24:51.160 --> 24:54.118
- Look, about the other night...
- Just forget about it.

24:54.280 --> 24:57.238
Just make sure that you let me know
when you plan to give notice...

24:57.400 --> 25:00.198
...so that I can hire your replacement.
- Caleb.

25:01.400 --> 25:03.118
Quite a party.

25:16.040 --> 25:18.031
You look...

25:29.760 --> 25:31.751
You clean up good.

25:33.480 --> 25:35.516
Are you trying to get caught?

25:36.480 --> 25:38.357
Find me later.

25:45.360 --> 25:46.918
I wish Dad had come.

25:47.080 --> 25:50.038
Why, so you could break up
another brawl?

25:50.200 --> 25:52.031
Hi, how are you?

25:52.200 --> 25:53.633
Hey, Summer.

25:55.560 --> 25:57.630
You look... Yeah.

25:57.800 --> 25:59.552
Hey, Marissa. Hi, Luke.

25:59.720 --> 26:02.188
Cohen, how you doing?
It's good to see you.

26:02.360 --> 26:05.796
- It is?
- So this is your place. It's beautiful.

26:05.960 --> 26:08.190
- Thank you.
- Mariss, something to drink?

26:08.360 --> 26:09.509
Sure.

26:11.440 --> 26:13.874
Okay, he got shot in the arm,
not the head.

26:14.040 --> 26:16.508
Come on.
Don't you wanna show me off?

26:25.200 --> 26:27.873
I'm in private equity
and portfolio management.

26:28.040 --> 26:30.838
Really? Private equity
and portfolio management.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.639
Sounds fascinating.

26:40.360 --> 26:43.557
It's a great party. Everybody seems
to be having a good time.

26:43.720 --> 26:45.199
Almost everybody.

26:45.360 --> 26:47.590
Look. Look, I...

26:47.760 --> 26:51.389
I wish I could tell you I'm sorry,
but I'm not.

26:51.560 --> 26:54.438
- Okay, worst apology ever.
- You know I'm no good at those.

26:54.600 --> 26:57.797
Look, the important thing is,
it's out there. You spoke your mind.

26:57.960 --> 26:59.871
No. You spoke my mind.

27:00.040 --> 27:04.192
I thought we had an understanding.
I thought this was what we both wanted.

27:04.360 --> 27:06.396
It is. It was.

27:06.560 --> 27:08.994
You're backing down.
He's been doing this to you for years.

27:09.160 --> 27:12.038
My dad isn't the reason we stayed here.

27:12.200 --> 27:14.111
We are. We chose this.

27:16.360 --> 27:19.079
If you're telling me that all this time
you've been unhappy...

27:19.240 --> 27:21.708
...that this isn't what you want...

27:21.880 --> 27:24.633
...then this is a much bigger conversation.

27:31.120 --> 27:32.473
I've got Pilates.

27:32.640 --> 27:34.915
- How's that going?
- It's great.

27:36.040 --> 27:37.712
It's Jimmy.

27:39.760 --> 27:41.557
Excuse me.

27:44.000 --> 27:47.549
I told you not to come.
What the hell are you doing here?

27:47.720 --> 27:50.393
I've got a plan, okay? Just take it easy.

27:50.560 --> 27:52.312
A chance to go back to the way it was.

27:52.480 --> 27:55.995
- You built a time machine?
- Caleb employs thousands of people.

27:56.200 --> 27:57.792
None are more qualified than me.

27:57.960 --> 28:02.078
How big a leap can it be from investing
in stocks to investing in real estate?

28:02.240 --> 28:05.357
- You are not asking him for a job.
- Why not?

28:05.520 --> 28:07.909
This whole community thinks
you're a criminal, Jimmy.

28:08.080 --> 28:10.753
Caleb Nichol owns the community.
He'll feel the same.

28:10.920 --> 28:13.673
The guy's loved me since I was a kid.
He taught me how to sail.

28:13.840 --> 28:17.515
When I was a junior in high school, he
tried to convince me to propose to Kirsten.

28:17.680 --> 28:20.638
Please. Don't even think
of talking to him.

28:21.960 --> 28:27.273
Look, I'm sorry. But if there's a chance
that I can save this family...

28:27.440 --> 28:29.317
...I'm gonna take it.

28:34.040 --> 28:35.234
This party rocks.

28:35.400 --> 28:37.960
- I cannot believe David Manperl's here.
- Who?

28:38.120 --> 28:41.430
Senior vice president of the
wealth-management division at McKenna.

28:41.600 --> 28:43.591
You know, the venture capitalist firm.

28:43.760 --> 28:47.196
He manages wealth as a job.

28:47.360 --> 28:49.271
I've been reading <i>Forbes</i>.

28:49.440 --> 28:50.759
I see.

28:50.920 --> 28:54.230
So you chose Luke, huh?

28:54.400 --> 28:56.868
Chino didn't stand a chance.
I told you Luke was the one.

28:57.040 --> 28:58.393
No, you didn't.

28:58.560 --> 29:00.118
Well, I meant to.

29:01.240 --> 29:03.595
You guys are all over each other.

29:03.760 --> 29:06.354
- Did you...? Did it happen?
- No.

29:06.520 --> 29:08.078
Well, his willpower is amazing.

29:08.240 --> 29:10.515
- The fact that you two haven't had sex...
- Summer!

29:10.680 --> 29:12.557
Coop, what more do you want?

29:12.720 --> 29:16.838
He's beautiful, sweet,
totally crazy about you.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.036
What are you waiting for?

29:20.520 --> 29:22.431
I don't know.

29:22.600 --> 29:26.559
Well, you better figure it out, because
he's not gonna be able to wait forever.

29:51.920 --> 29:54.229
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

29:54.400 --> 29:55.833
Somebody's hiding.

29:56.000 --> 29:57.877
No, I'm just...

29:58.040 --> 29:59.632
Bored.

30:02.080 --> 30:03.229
Me too.

30:03.400 --> 30:04.913
I've heard.

30:05.640 --> 30:08.871
- She's just a girl.
- I know.

30:11.280 --> 30:14.431
- So why are you hiding from her?
- I'm not.

30:15.080 --> 30:17.150
I don't believe you.

30:28.600 --> 30:31.068
- Still bored?
- Not so much.

30:48.600 --> 30:51.831
Sorry. I... I thought...

30:53.640 --> 30:55.232
Sorry.

31:11.080 --> 31:13.036
I've just been surfing...

31:13.200 --> 31:15.236
Hey, babe, I was looking...

31:18.400 --> 31:21.312
- Let's go.
- Yeah, okay.

31:31.880 --> 31:35.077
We could go to my place.
My parents went to Palm Springs.

31:35.240 --> 31:37.310
Yeah, sure. Great.

31:44.000 --> 31:48.676
Pharmaceuticals. Isn't that the
largest-growing industry in North America?

31:51.720 --> 31:54.598
Remember the old days, Jimmy?
Where's the time gone?

31:54.760 --> 31:57.479
Great to see you again, as always.

32:00.840 --> 32:04.674
Hey. Congratulations.
Looks like you got yourself a job.

32:04.840 --> 32:06.717
Oh, yeah.
Caleb couldn't have been nicer...

32:06.880 --> 32:09.314
...when he said there was no way
he could hire me.

32:11.080 --> 32:14.709
- Well, hate to say I told you so.
- No, you don't.

32:15.600 --> 32:17.591
Where are you going?

32:19.280 --> 32:21.032
To finish what you started.

32:25.240 --> 32:28.232
- Happy birthday, Cal.
- Julie. Thank you.

32:28.400 --> 32:30.277
I'll call you next week.

32:30.440 --> 32:33.113
- How are you?
- Well, I'm sure you've heard.

32:33.280 --> 32:37.319
- Kirsten's brought you up to speed.
- I'm really sorry. About everything.

32:37.800 --> 32:39.791
I really liked your husband.

32:39.960 --> 32:41.791
Soon to be ex-husband.

32:42.760 --> 32:46.469
Can't expect me to stay with him, not
after he's lied to me, left us with nothing.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.275
- Nothing?
- Yeah.

32:50.440 --> 32:53.159
I suppose I'll have to get a job now,
doing God knows what.

32:53.320 --> 32:55.311
It's not like I have
any marketable skills.

32:55.480 --> 32:56.993
Well, I'm sure that's not true.

32:57.160 --> 33:01.517
You know, if there's anything
that I can do for you or the girls...

33:01.680 --> 33:04.638
You're very, very sweet.
And very busy.

33:09.320 --> 33:11.470
I just wanted to say happy birthday.

33:11.640 --> 33:13.710
I'm never too busy for you.

33:13.880 --> 33:16.553
We'll have dinner,
figure something out.

33:16.720 --> 33:18.278
I'd like that.

33:19.400 --> 33:20.833
Thank you.

33:34.440 --> 33:37.352
Hey. What are you doing?
I need you to introduce me...

33:37.520 --> 33:40.671
- Okay. You know what, Summer? No.
- What?

33:40.840 --> 33:43.877
This whole night, all you've done
is use me to meet rich older guys.

33:44.200 --> 33:46.430
That's not true.

33:47.320 --> 33:48.992
Okay. Maybe a little.

33:49.160 --> 33:52.630
Do you have any idea how pathetic it is
to listen to you talk about mergers...

33:52.800 --> 33:55.394
...while some guy
just stares at your boobs?

33:55.560 --> 33:58.552
- Which guy was staring at my boobs?
- Who cares?

33:58.720 --> 34:02.872
The point is, if that guy doesn't know you,
he doesn't care about who you really are.

34:03.040 --> 34:06.271
He has no idea that every day
of third grade you shared your lunch...

34:06.440 --> 34:09.351
...with a skinny squirrel whose nuts
were stolen by a fat squirrel.

34:09.520 --> 34:10.714
I hated that mean squirrel.

34:10.880 --> 34:13.996
None of those guys were there
when you read your poem aloud in class...

34:14.159 --> 34:17.152
...and your hand was shaking
because you were nervous.

34:17.320 --> 34:19.550
Poem? What poem?

34:21.679 --> 34:24.989
"I Wish I Was a Mermaid."

34:26.840 --> 34:28.956
You remember that?

34:29.120 --> 34:31.190
That was, like, sixth grade.

34:34.600 --> 34:37.831
<i>I wish I was a mermaid</i>
<i>And...</i>

34:40.400 --> 34:43.676
<i>Was friends with all the fish</i>
<i>A shiny tail and seashells, that's</i>...

34:53.760 --> 34:56.228
<i>What I would wish</i>

35:02.280 --> 35:04.316
Oh, I gotta go.

35:04.480 --> 35:08.359
There's that investment banker
from Woodward and McDonnough.

35:09.680 --> 35:13.309
It's okay. I'll introduce myself.

35:22.240 --> 35:23.559
The greatest party ever.

35:26.800 --> 35:30.509
- She has no intention of quitting.
- Doesn't sound that way to me.

35:30.680 --> 35:34.150
Well, I wish she would,
so we could get the hell away from you.

35:34.320 --> 35:35.878
- Lf you're looking for a fight...
- Save it.

35:36.040 --> 35:39.715
We both know you're punishing her
because she's doing so well without you.

35:40.960 --> 35:44.669
You're afraid she won't need your help
to run the company or her family.

35:44.840 --> 35:47.229
And I got news for you.
She's better than you at both.

35:47.400 --> 35:50.437
If you don't wanna lose her,
let her keep doing what she's been doing.

35:50.600 --> 35:55.151
You'll stay rich, she'll be happy,
and I'll figure out a way to make it work.

35:56.680 --> 35:58.511
I need a corkscrew.

36:02.720 --> 36:04.358
Have a nice time.

36:17.320 --> 36:18.912
Great party, Kiki.

36:22.680 --> 36:24.238
Your mom would have loved it.

36:25.200 --> 36:28.829
Birthdays, holidays.
She always loved a good party.

36:29.000 --> 36:30.319
She did.

36:34.720 --> 36:35.869
I miss her.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.275
I know. Me too.

36:42.120 --> 36:45.078
Your sister, do you ever hear from her?

36:45.240 --> 36:47.674
I wanted to invite her,
but I couldn't reach her.

36:47.840 --> 36:49.990
The number I have
is no longer in service.

36:51.720 --> 36:56.396
- And then there were two.
- You could look at it like that.

37:00.200 --> 37:01.792
You're all I got, Kiki.

37:02.880 --> 37:05.872
And then I'm running you so ragged
you haven't got time to talk to me.

37:06.040 --> 37:10.591
That's not true, and you know it.
I love working for you.

37:11.760 --> 37:13.876
I just want you to be proud of me.

37:27.200 --> 37:29.395
Taking in a stray kid.

37:30.240 --> 37:32.310
That's the sort of thing your mom
would've done.

37:32.480 --> 37:35.392
Yeah, except she would have done it
just to piss you off.

37:45.120 --> 37:46.792
Don't be late Monday.

38:05.920 --> 38:07.956
- Hi.
- Hi.

38:11.960 --> 38:14.155
So I guess she likes you.

38:16.840 --> 38:18.751
I guess she did.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.594
You look so sad. I...

38:27.400 --> 38:29.152
I'd give anything to be that miserable.

38:32.400 --> 38:37.155
Because if I remember correctly,
that's what it feels like to be in love.

39:08.840 --> 39:10.637
I love you so much.

39:31.960 --> 39:33.313
Do you...?

39:34.480 --> 39:36.277
I mean, are you...?

39:37.920 --> 39:39.273
Okay.

39:42.520 --> 39:44.351
Yeah, you're sure?

39:45.440 --> 39:46.793
Yeah.

39:47.400 --> 39:49.072
I want to.

39:50.920 --> 39:52.831
Should I grab a...?

39:54.160 --> 39:55.434
Yeah.

40:38.280 --> 40:41.317
- Do you want me to walk you in?
- No. Thanks.

40:43.360 --> 40:44.952
I love you.

40:47.240 --> 40:48.832
Love you too.

41:17.640 --> 41:19.358
You're too late.
