75% of the weight of the horse.

rasping the nails off, pulling
the shoe--old shoes off,

04:23.698 --> 04:27.267
then tomorrow fitting
in a new shoe to the foot

04:27.310 --> 04:28.442
and nailing it on.

04:28.485 --> 04:30.226

a full-on pedicure.

04:30.270 --> 04:31.314
- Full-on pedicure.
- Got it.

04:33.577 --> 04:35.927
- All right.
- Let's send it over to Mitch.

want to come on over,

05:13.835 --> 05:15.663
we'll show you how
to take shoes off.

05:19.275 --> 05:22.496
We're working with an animal,
so he'll react off of you.

05:22.539 --> 05:24.062
Oh, my goodness.

05:24.106 --> 05:26.587
So no sudden movements.
You don't go fast. You go slow.

05:26.630 --> 05:28.850
So always ask him
to pick his foot up.

05:28.893 --> 05:30.852
But to start, you want
to take your hoof pick.

05:30.895 --> 05:32.375
Did you call that
a hoof pick?

05:32.419 --> 05:33.724
- Well, this--
- The screwdriver?

05:33.768 --> 05:35.073
I use a screwdriver,
but you guys will--

05:35.117 --> 05:36.684
Yeah, I was gonna say,
that's a screwdriver.

05:36.727 --> 05:39.861
You'll want to clear
the debris out.

05:39.904 --> 05:41.384
- I'm not doing that.
- That doesn't hurt him?

05:41.428 --> 05:42.472
- No.
- I'm not doing that.

05:42.516 --> 05:44.082
Put that foot on the stand,

05:44.126 --> 05:46.520
and then you're going to take
the smooth edge of this rasp

05:46.563 --> 05:50.132
and file these nail heads off.

05:50.175 --> 05:52.743
Oh, I don't know about this.

05:52.787 --> 05:54.179
Put the foot
in between your legs

05:54.223 --> 05:55.833
and hold onto it
with your knees.

05:55.877 --> 05:59.010
Then you'll start back here
on the heels and then just go--

06:00.838 --> 06:02.884
You're not touching. I'm in
between the foot and the shoe.

06:02.927 --> 06:06.540
I thought taking off
my thigh-highs were bad.

06:06.583 --> 06:08.106
And that's all there
is to it.

06:08.150 --> 06:09.934
You make this look so easy.

06:09.978 --> 06:11.675
God, that's a lot.

06:11.719 --> 06:13.677
Go ahead and grab your horses
and bring them up to the fence,

06:13.721 --> 06:15.026
tie them up,
and we'll start shoeing 'em.

06:15.070 --> 06:16.071
Okay.

06:16.114 --> 06:17.812
I can barely breathe out
here,

06:17.855 --> 06:20.858
and they put the horse way down
on the other side of the ranch.

06:20.902 --> 06:23.470
Go ahead and tie him up
to that post. Perfect.

06:23.513 --> 06:25.167
Yeah.

06:25.210 --> 06:27.430
And then to lock it, you just
put it in the nail like that.

06:27.474 --> 06:29.389
Good job.

06:29.432 --> 06:31.434
Go clean that hoof.

06:31.478 --> 06:33.131
What's a hoof?

06:33.175 --> 06:35.003
The foot, man.

06:35.046 --> 06:36.178
Get in there.
- They never--

06:36.221 --> 06:38.615
they never said that.
They said toes.

06:38.659 --> 06:41.226
Where do you see toes?

06:41.270 --> 06:42.706
Horse toes.

06:42.750 --> 06:44.447
There's no horse toes.
It's a hoof.

06:44.491 --> 06:45.970
- Feet.
- I'm dying. That's so funny.

06:46.014 --> 06:47.407
They have shoes.

06:47.450 --> 06:49.060
Come this way with it.
There you go.

06:49.104 --> 06:50.627
Mother

06:50.671 --> 06:53.543
- Let me square it up.
- Okay. Come on, meatball.

06:53.587 --> 06:57.155
Just squeeze
that tendon down low.

06:57.199 --> 06:58.766

that debris up.

07:01.159 --> 07:03.118
Perfect.

07:03.161 --> 07:04.859
Now we're going to put it
on that stand.

07:04.902 --> 07:06.469
With the smooth edge
of the rasp,

07:06.513 --> 07:09.733
you're just taking
this nail head off.

07:09.777 --> 07:12.649
- It's like a cheese grater.
- There we go.

07:12.693 --> 07:14.085
You're getting
the hang of it now.

07:14.129 --> 07:15.826
- Those feet grow back ever?
- It'll grow back.

07:15.870 --> 07:17.480
- Oh, they do grow back?
- Yeah.

07:17.524 --> 07:19.830
It's just like your fingernail.
It's the exact same thing.

07:19.874 --> 07:23.007
- You ready?
- Grab the bottom of his foot.

07:23.051 --> 07:24.618
Okay. Thank you, babe.

07:24.661 --> 07:28.099
- Ready? Down in there.
- Oh, oh.

07:28.143 --> 07:29.666
Wow.

07:29.710 --> 07:32.190
I have a lot of anxiety
about this job.

07:32.234 --> 07:33.496
This is not easy.

07:33.540 --> 07:35.280
We almost got it.
One more good one.

07:35.324 --> 07:37.282
<i>I mean, I get my nails done</i> <i>
every two weeks.</i>

07:37.326 --> 07:40.590
<i>Typically, there's no pain,</i> <i>
but there are instances</i>

07:40.634 --> 07:42.374
when I accidentally get cut

07:42.418 --> 07:47.031
or the drill hits me
the wrong way, and it hurts.

07:47.075 --> 07:48.337

<i>We're amateurs.</i> <i>

07:50.818 --> 07:52.254
You can hold on
to it with your legs.

07:52.297 --> 07:54.386
There you go. Squeeze it.
You want to pry down

07:54.430 --> 07:59.435
and kind of towards the inside,
just like that. You got it.

07:59.479 --> 08:00.610
There you go.

08:00.654 --> 08:03.134
Thank you.

08:03.178 --> 08:07.269
I don't want to do it.

08:07.312 --> 08:09.314
- Got it?
- Whoo!

08:09.358 --> 08:10.925
Got to take this off.

08:10.968 --> 08:12.492
<i>The only part</i> <i>

08:12.535 --> 08:13.797
is holding the horse's foot.

08:13.841 --> 08:15.886
Pick his foot up.

08:15.930 --> 08:17.627
This is the most
dangerous thing we've done.

08:17.671 --> 08:21.501
If you get kicked by a horse,
you could die, like, instantly.

08:23.067 --> 08:25.113
Pick it all the way up.
Pick it all the way up.

08:25.156 --> 08:28.159
Every time I come up
he just puts it back down.

08:28.203 --> 08:30.248
- Pick it all the way up.
- I'm picking it up.

08:30.292 --> 08:31.380
He's just like.
- He doesn't wanna do it.

08:31.423 --> 08:32.990
So when you pick it up...

08:33.034 --> 08:36.516
I don't think that Myles
is used to, like, labor work.

08:36.559 --> 08:38.996
All right, try again.

08:39.040 --> 08:40.389
I'm starting to hit
my limits.

08:40.432 --> 08:42.957
He's gonna pick it up.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.524
Yeah, there--here it comes.

08:44.567 --> 08:46.526
Now just hang on to it and
grab it with your other hand.

08:49.398 --> 08:52.183
There. You got her.

08:52.227 --> 08:53.794
I don't know
if he's done physical work

08:53.837 --> 08:55.447
a day in his life.

08:56.710 --> 08:58.015
Good job.

08:58.059 --> 09:02.672
It came off in one swoop.
Who's next?

09:02.716 --> 09:04.065
- Oh, God.
- Let's go.

09:04.108 --> 09:05.457
- You got it, Jas.
- Come on, Jas.

09:05.501 --> 09:08.504
- Oh, no.
- You got this.

09:08.548 --> 09:11.202
- Okay.
- Start at the heel.

09:13.944 --> 09:15.685
Yo, don't hold your breath.
Just squeeze.

09:15.729 --> 09:17.426
You gotta, like,
exhale when you press.

09:17.469 --> 09:19.907
Oh, my gosh.
