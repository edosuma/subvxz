01:10.937 --> 01:12.165
Wha... Ho!

01:12.238 --> 01:14.763
Whoa!

01:15.408 --> 01:18.900
Oh! Man, oh, man!

01:18.978 --> 01:21.538
I almost lost it back there.

01:21.614 --> 01:23.206
I didn't know what was going on.

01:23.283 --> 01:24.648
Oh!

01:24.717 --> 01:27.379
Oh...

01:43.103 --> 01:44.502
Mmm.

01:49.542 --> 01:52.773
- Oh, hey, babe? Doug?
- Huh?

01:52.846 --> 01:55.872
Can you take Billy to school?
My day kinda got away from me.

01:55.949 --> 01:58.782
Yeah, yeah. Unless there's
an emergency at the office.

01:58.852 --> 02:00.217
Oh, was there an emergency?

02:00.286 --> 02:02.481
You know, dentists
do have emergencies.

02:02.555 --> 02:04.785
- Oh.
- Sometimes.

02:04.858 --> 02:08.794
- Ah.
- We are doctors.

02:11.564 --> 02:14.533
Hey, no, no! Not until your LDL
is under a hundred.

02:17.203 --> 02:20.730
Well, Mr. Putnam,
any plans this summer?

02:20.807 --> 02:24.402
What's... What'd he say?

02:24.477 --> 02:27.037
He said we're taking
an African safari.

02:27.113 --> 02:30.310
Africa. I don't think I've been
out of Cincinnati in 12 years.

02:30.383 --> 02:33.648
You owe it to yourself
to get out and enjoy life.

02:33.720 --> 02:38.180
You can't just live to work!
You need excitement!

02:39.926 --> 02:41.518
Come on. Don't be a baby,

02:41.594 --> 02:45.121
it's a d... Oh, the suction,
the extractor. Hold on.

02:45.198 --> 02:47.428
That'll suck the spots
off a Dalmatian.

02:47.500 --> 02:48.990
Help me, help me,
all right.

02:49.068 --> 02:51.730
Know what they call this?
One powerful little sucker.

02:51.804 --> 02:54.432
That's the brand name.
It's unbelievable.

02:54.507 --> 02:57.670
See? I have plenty of excitement
in my life, Mrs. Putnam.

03:03.082 --> 03:04.379
<i>Bobby?</i>

03:04.450 --> 03:06.884
Karen, I asked
for no disturbances.

03:06.953 --> 03:08.784
<i>I need to talk to you, Bobby.</i>

03:08.855 --> 03:11.289
Technically,
I'm at the office right now.

03:11.357 --> 03:13.848
And technically, you're
in our guest bedroom.

03:13.927 --> 03:17.328
Look, I know baby. I... I just
gotta finish this chapter.

03:17.397 --> 03:18.694
I know. But you know what?

03:18.765 --> 03:21.256
I have to go to a job
that actually makes us money.

03:21.334 --> 03:23.598
And I'm late, so walk me to the door.

03:23.670 --> 03:26.002
Come on, Bobby.
I gotta get to work. OK?

03:26.072 --> 03:27.903
Oh, Wait. I forgot my cell phone.

03:27.974 --> 03:30.238
- Stay.
- Hey, Daddy! Listen!

03:30.310 --> 03:33.609
Whoa.

03:33.680 --> 03:35.307
Hey, no. Inside voice.

03:35.381 --> 03:37.508
- Inside voice.
- Would you shut up!

03:37.584 --> 03:40.883
God, it's like living
with a car alarm that shits.

03:40.954 --> 03:44.321
Whoa. What are you doing
trying to leave the house wearing that?

03:44.390 --> 03:47.484
- You look like a Eskimo hooker.
- Dad, that's the point.

03:47.560 --> 03:50.996
- You wanna look like a hooker?
- Dad, you are so lame.

03:51.064 --> 03:55.296
It's hard for kids to respect a man
that don't do none of the providing.

03:55.368 --> 03:59.702
In my day the lady stayed home.
Not the lazy man.

03:59.772 --> 04:02.104
In your day the men
had pyramids to build.

04:02.175 --> 04:03.540
How old is that?

04:03.610 --> 04:05.771
I'm in complete
control of my finan...

04:05.845 --> 04:08.405
No.

04:08.481 --> 04:11.279
Hush. Come.

04:11.351 --> 04:14.081
How come she gets quiet
when you say something to her?

04:14.153 --> 04:16.620
Because you, my darling,
have no control.

04:16.689 --> 04:20.785
Baby, I know your how-to book
is gonna be a huge success someday.

04:20.860 --> 04:23.021
But do you remember
what day today is?

04:23.096 --> 04:24.461
No.

04:24.530 --> 04:26.760
We had agreed that
you would take a year off

04:26.833 --> 04:29.961
to pursue this little fantasy
of yours, but that year is up.

04:30.036 --> 04:31.594
Now you and I had a deal.

04:31.671 --> 04:34.299
Come on, baby.
Stressful cases.

04:34.374 --> 04:36.399
Clients under duress.

04:36.476 --> 04:39.468
I'm tired of dealing
with shit all the time.

04:39.545 --> 04:42.446
Besides, how do we even know
they'll take me back?

04:42.515 --> 04:44.540
- Because I called.
- You're serious?

04:44.617 --> 04:47.814
The Firm is ecstatic
to have you back, Bobby.

04:47.887 --> 04:49.821
You got a nine o'clock
appointment.

04:51.958 --> 04:54.984
- You call The Firm?
- Yeah, men's room.

04:55.061 --> 04:58.519
Some truck's driver must've crap
an entire cow in there, man.

04:58.598 --> 04:59.587
Good luck.

05:03.503 --> 05:05.334
I didn't want to
give him the key,

05:05.405 --> 05:07.339
but I didn't trust my instincts.

05:13.813 --> 05:17.840
I saw my father shot.
I never cry until today.

05:22.255 --> 05:25.918
I got robbed yesterday,
and I know now,

05:25.992 --> 05:28.085
your job is the bad one.

05:28.161 --> 05:30.721
Yeah.

05:48.314 --> 05:51.147
<i>- Dudley?
- Yes, good morning, Mac.</i>

05:51.217 --> 05:52.878
How's it going?

05:52.952 --> 05:55.079
<i>It is now
nine o'clock AM.</i>

05:55.154 --> 05:58.385
Thanks, Mac.
Open Internet, please.

05:58.458 --> 06:01.825
<i>- Command unknown.
- Open Internet.</i>

06:01.894 --> 06:03.259
<i>Internet open.</i>

06:04.797 --> 06:07.288
I think I have to research
alternative specs.

06:07.367 --> 06:10.996
<i>- Searching alternative sex.
- What? No. I didn't say that.</i>

06:11.070 --> 06:12.833
<i>Granny Love dot org.</i>

06:12.905 --> 06:15.237
<i>- Want granny to take her teeth out?
- Shut down.</i>

06:15.308 --> 06:17.469
<i>Barnyard love.</i>

06:17.543 --> 06:19.977
<i>- I'm sorry.
- Enjoy the animals.</i>

06:20.913 --> 06:23.575
<i>Granny's gonna
spank your bottom.</i>

06:23.649 --> 06:25.310
<i>All kinds of fun.</i>

06:25.385 --> 06:28.013
<i>I can fix that.</i>

06:31.491 --> 06:33.482
Or not.

06:36.229 --> 06:37.992
Well, iCat.

06:39.165 --> 06:41.224
Looks like it's you and me.

06:51.744 --> 06:53.837
OK, Larry, so what are
you trying to tell me?

06:53.913 --> 06:56.404
- You're broke.
- Well, how does that work?

06:56.482 --> 06:59.212
You've spent everything
you had, then spent some more.

06:59.285 --> 07:01.048
This is right here.
Nothing. Zero.

07:01.120 --> 07:02.451
You know what?

07:02.522 --> 07:05.116
Maybe it's time for my wife,
the "supermodel,"

07:05.191 --> 07:07.716
to start paying for some things
for once in her life.

07:07.794 --> 07:09.091
You're getting divorced.

07:09.162 --> 07:12.461
- Why would she pay?
- Divorced, going broke...

07:12.532 --> 07:14.466
You think I'm falling apart,
don't you?

07:14.534 --> 07:16.263
Not going broke.
You are broke.

07:16.335 --> 07:19.031
- OK.
- The door's behind you.

07:19.105 --> 07:22.370
No, no, you listen to me, Toby.
You're not gonna push me around.

07:22.442 --> 07:25.275
We agreed on a price, and
that's the price I'm gonna pay.

07:25.344 --> 07:28.370
You got it? And if you don't like it,
just walk away.

07:28.448 --> 07:31.178
I'll tell you this, you can
kiss your business goodbye.

07:31.250 --> 07:34.583
If you screw with Woody Stevens,
you go down hard. You got that?

07:34.654 --> 07:37.248
What?
No, money is not a problem.

07:37.323 --> 07:39.883
Don't insult me.
Don't insult me!

07:39.959 --> 07:41.358
Money's never a problem!

07:41.427 --> 07:44.191
You just have to honor
the correct price, you got that?

07:44.263 --> 07:46.163
What?

07:49.035 --> 07:52.004
Well, then go home, Toby!
You make me sick!

07:52.071 --> 07:54.938
I can't do this many leaves
for ten bucks.

07:55.007 --> 07:56.269
It'll take hours!

07:56.342 --> 07:59.038
You should've thought of that
before you put that flyer

07:59.111 --> 08:01.875
on the telephone pole saying,
"Any yard for ten bucks."

08:03.049 --> 08:05.210
Toby. Come on, let's talk.

08:05.284 --> 08:07.775
Let's talk like men, OK?

08:07.854 --> 08:09.981
What's the problem?

08:10.056 --> 08:13.389
- Money's the problem!
- Grow up, Toby!

08:14.894 --> 08:17.192
- I hate you.
- I hate you!

08:18.731 --> 08:19.891
Moron!

08:22.969 --> 08:26.166
- Kel, it's me.
- I'll be right down.

08:27.106 --> 08:28.437
Hey, Bill.

08:28.508 --> 08:33.172
You wanna shoot some hoops or
something before I take my ride?

08:33.246 --> 08:36.841
No, thanks.

08:36.916 --> 08:40.352
- Uh...
- Hey, babe. How was work?

08:40.419 --> 08:42.148
- Mmm.
- Great.

08:42.221 --> 08:43.984
Good.

08:44.056 --> 08:46.115
Hello? Cool. I'll ask right now.

08:46.192 --> 08:48.922
- Can I play ball with Stew and his dad?
- Of course you can.

08:48.995 --> 08:50.121
Cool. Thanks.

08:50.196 --> 08:52.756
Here, dude, I'll be right over,
OK? All right, bye.

08:52.832 --> 08:55.858
I just asked you if you wanted
to play ball. You said no.

08:55.935 --> 08:57.994
Well, yeah. I mean,
Stew's dad is awesome.

08:58.070 --> 08:59.401
He can totally dunk.

08:59.472 --> 09:01.940
The hoop's what?
Eight feet above the ground?

09:02.008 --> 09:06.069
- Anybody could dunk that.
- Well. See you guys later.

09:07.613 --> 09:10.343
Doug, I am so sorry.
You know, I had no idea.

09:10.416 --> 09:12.441
It wasn't your fault.
You didn't know.

09:12.518 --> 09:15.681
What do I gotta do
to relate to my son?

09:38.144 --> 09:40.169
Hey, guys?

09:40.246 --> 09:42.271
Does this sound better?

09:43.282 --> 09:44.408
Whoa!

09:52.091 --> 09:55.390
I'm OK! I hit my butt.

10:33.065 --> 10:34.532
Thanks, Woody.

10:34.600 --> 10:36.659
I feel really safe with you.

10:36.736 --> 10:39.204
I noticed. If you ever
lay your head on my back again

10:39.271 --> 10:42.069
when you're riding bitch,
I'll throw you in the traffic.

10:42.141 --> 10:45.599
I... I was just trying
to keep the wind off my face.

10:45.678 --> 10:48.841
- I felt you smell my neck.
- Guys, could we?

10:50.449 --> 10:52.474
Did you smell
that man's neck?

10:52.551 --> 10:54.985
His cologne is fantastic.

10:55.054 --> 10:57.852
It's musky with an oaky finish.

10:57.923 --> 11:01.450
Like a lawyer cowboy.

11:01.527 --> 11:03.654
Lawyer cowboy?

11:04.630 --> 11:07.030
Wild Hogs aren't welcome here.

11:07.099 --> 11:08.532
- Hey, Paul.
- How you doing?

11:08.601 --> 11:09.761
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Paul.

11:09.835 --> 11:11.029
Hey, Woody.

11:11.103 --> 11:13.799
Just waiting on those K-ones
to do your tax returns.

11:13.873 --> 11:17.206
We also need to talk about that
offshore incorporating thing.

11:17.276 --> 11:18.937
Yeah, well,
I'll give you a call.

11:19.011 --> 11:22.913
OK. I'll set up lunch.
Or we could do a day at the spa.

11:22.982 --> 11:24.882
Now that was fun.

11:24.950 --> 11:27.919
- Huh?
- I don't remember that.

11:27.987 --> 11:31.684
- Got your wine cooler, Dad.
- Oh, sweet. Thanks.

11:31.757 --> 11:34.191
- I'll see you Hogs in Hell!
- We'll make it.

11:34.260 --> 11:37.024
- That was scary, Paul. Good work.
- See you later.

11:37.096 --> 11:40.190
- I'm not coming here anymore.
- But this is a Wild Hog tradition.

11:40.266 --> 11:42.734
We're not Wild Hogs,
we're like wild lambs.

11:42.802 --> 11:44.963
It's just a patch
that Doug's wife made.

11:45.037 --> 11:47.505
We sewed it on our jackets
so she wouldn't feel bad.

11:47.573 --> 11:49.131
- Is that a fact?
- Yeah.

11:49.208 --> 11:51.073
Well, what has
your wife ever made us?

11:51.143 --> 11:52.167
Hard.

11:52.244 --> 11:54.337
- Hey.
- That's true, she is really.

11:54.413 --> 11:57.974
- All I'm saying is she's good-looking.
- Show some respect.

11:58.050 --> 12:00.985
Come on. That's what your wife does.
She's a swimsuit model.

12:01.053 --> 12:03.317
And it... And a good one,
I mean. She is hot.

12:03.389 --> 12:07.189
OK, here's a question:
What are we doing here?

12:07.259 --> 12:09.591
Having... Having beers
like we do every week.

12:09.662 --> 12:13.291
No, no, no. Bigger picture. Life, man.
What do we have to look forward to?

12:13.365 --> 12:15.526
Riding in formation
in the Labor Day Parade?

12:15.601 --> 12:17.967
- Is that it?
- I'm looking forward to the parade.

12:18.037 --> 12:20.198
I got Tootsie Rolls
I can throw to the kids.

12:20.272 --> 12:21.864
Tootsie Rolls

12:21.941 --> 12:23.704
that he can throw to the kids.

12:23.776 --> 12:27.576
Man, you can't even put on your
turn signal without busting your ass.

12:27.646 --> 12:30.240
Look, let's put some
real miles on those bikes.

12:30.316 --> 12:33.717
- Road trip?
- Yeah. A road trip.

12:33.786 --> 12:37.984
Just us. No rules.
No Tootsie Rolls.

12:38.057 --> 12:40.821
Just us, the wind,
the road to the Pacific.

12:40.893 --> 12:42.952
We camp out for a week,
whenever we want,

12:43.028 --> 12:44.859
wherever we want.

12:44.930 --> 12:46.420
I mean, that's freedom, man.

12:46.499 --> 12:48.558
As long as we stop
at some Wi-Fi hotspots,

12:48.634 --> 12:50.864
- count me in. Yep.
- You're in? All right.

12:50.936 --> 12:54.099
Eh, I can't.
I can't get the time off of work.

12:54.173 --> 12:56.937
- You know, I'm a doctor.
- You're a dentist.

12:57.009 --> 13:00.410
Look, in college... Man,
he'd have been packed already.

13:00.479 --> 13:03.448
I'm not kidding. You know,
and on a bike, he's fearless.

13:03.516 --> 13:05.643
- He was fearless.
- Yeah, well, that was...

13:05.718 --> 13:08.744
This guy, we called him
"The Golden Knight." Where's that guy?

13:08.821 --> 13:11.756
- I wanna see that guy again.
- That guy's married now.

13:11.824 --> 13:15.658
And that guy, uh, used to...
used to get high a lot.

13:15.728 --> 13:18.128
- What's Claudia gonna say about this?
- Nothing.

13:18.197 --> 13:22.258
<i>She's in the Bahamas doing some
swimsuit thing for Sports Illustrated.</i>

13:22.334 --> 13:24.199
Look, if not now, when?

13:24.270 --> 13:27.899
Y'all know me.
I'm the first to get buck wild.

13:27.973 --> 13:30.441
- But...
- No, you're afraid to ask your wife.

13:30.509 --> 13:34.104
True. True. I said true!

13:34.180 --> 13:35.807
Come on!

13:35.881 --> 13:38.975
<i>This is it, on the edge, we're living!
You know, St. Elmo's Fire,</i>

13:39.051 --> 13:41.019
<i>The Wild Bunch.
You know, Deliverance!</i>

13:41.086 --> 13:42.178
<i>Deliverance?</i>

13:42.254 --> 13:43.949
<i>- Uh... You know...
- Deliverance?</i>

13:44.023 --> 13:45.854
<i>Deliverance?</i>

13:45.925 --> 13:48.792
Hey, dudes. We're gonna
ride as an American flag

13:48.861 --> 13:50.089
in the parade this year.

13:50.162 --> 13:52.460
Each guy in our chapter
is a star.

13:52.531 --> 13:54.192
- A what?
- I'm gonna get sick.

13:54.266 --> 13:57.633
- Who's gonna do the stripes?
- Lyman Middle School majorettes.

13:57.703 --> 14:00.035
Oh, boy. Hey, we're
really living now, huh?

14:00.105 --> 14:02.096
I hope we don't get
hit by a stray baton.

14:02.174 --> 14:04.039
You know what?
I'm outta here.

14:04.109 --> 14:06.339
I'm going with you guys
or without you guys.

14:06.412 --> 14:07.538
You know what I mean?

14:07.613 --> 14:09.478
Take your smelly tees.
Good night.

14:09.548 --> 14:11.311
- I said I'd go.
- Come on back.

14:11.383 --> 14:14.113
Hmm. Oh, I almost forgot.

14:14.186 --> 14:16.552
We're also gonna be wearing
these black ribbons

14:16.622 --> 14:19.455
in honor of Tom Peterson.
He died last week...

14:19.525 --> 14:23.586
Boom! Just like that.
Anyway, he'll be missed.

14:25.264 --> 14:27.198
Tom Peterson. Tom Peterson.

14:27.266 --> 14:29.257
Do you remember that guy?

14:29.335 --> 14:31.360
He was our age.

14:41.947 --> 14:44.040
- Mom, want some gravy?
- Oh, yeah, thanks.

14:46.452 --> 14:49.012
- So how was your ride?
- I don't know.

14:49.088 --> 14:52.649
All Woody did was yap about taking
some stupid cross-country trip.

14:52.725 --> 14:54.852
Do you wanna talk
about going on this ride?

14:54.927 --> 14:56.622
I can't go on a cross-country trip.

14:56.695 --> 14:58.754
I can't walk away
from work anytime I want.

14:58.831 --> 15:01.231
Yeah, you know what,
you're right.

15:01.300 --> 15:02.767
It's just as well.

15:02.835 --> 15:05.770
Road trips probably aren't
the best thing for a guy your age.

15:05.838 --> 15:08.170
I mean, it's gotta be
really inconvenient.

15:08.240 --> 15:10.936
Bunch of middle-aged guys
having to get off their bikes

15:11.010 --> 15:12.671
every 20 minutes to take a pee...

15:12.745 --> 15:15.908
My age? What kind of crack is that?
What's wrong with my age?

15:15.981 --> 15:18.074
She talks like I'm not
right here, you know?

15:18.150 --> 15:19.777
Doug, I'm joking.

15:19.852 --> 15:22.980
No, you know what I think?
I think you think I'm a boring guy.

15:23.055 --> 15:25.353
I'm old and I'm boring now.
I've become lame.

15:25.424 --> 15:28.052
I think everybody thinks that
at this table. I'm lame!

15:28.127 --> 15:30.391
- Admit it! I'm lame!
- Doug, calm down. It's OK.

15:30.462 --> 15:33.022
No, I'm not gonna calm down.
You know what I think?

15:33.098 --> 15:36.090
"Calming down" means
another word for "lame!"

15:36.168 --> 15:39.695
I'm not lame!
You know, I'm wild and free!

15:39.772 --> 15:41.933
Wild and free and a man, yeah!

15:42.007 --> 15:44.908
A man that likes to eat meat.
I'm tired of not eating meat!

15:44.977 --> 15:47.241
Meat's good!
Good for men.

15:47.313 --> 15:51.044
And potatoes. I like
potatoes and I like gravy

15:51.116 --> 15:54.677
on my potatoes. Yum, yum!

15:58.857 --> 16:01.655
- Don't make sudden moves.
- I'm living wild, living good.

16:01.727 --> 16:04.093
- It feels good, baby!
- Whoa, no, Dad. Your LDL.

16:04.163 --> 16:07.030
Butt out, LDLs! I miss butter.
You know why I miss butter?

16:07.099 --> 16:10.262
The French think butter
is just like cheese, they eat it...

16:10.336 --> 16:12.896
They eat it just like this.
Right off the stick.

16:12.972 --> 16:16.840
And the French, who've never won
a major battle, they know how to eat!

16:16.909 --> 16:18.843
And I...

16:18.911 --> 16:21.573
I am living,
and it feels great!

16:25.017 --> 16:26.814
Mmm...

16:27.686 --> 16:29.677
Hmm.

16:29.755 --> 16:33.247
Doug, are you OK?

16:33.325 --> 16:34.724
Doug, you OK?

16:34.793 --> 16:37.694
- Yeah! I'm all right...
- Dad, just spit it out!

16:37.763 --> 16:38.991
Spit it out! Come on.

16:39.064 --> 16:40.998
- Breathe, breathe!
- I am not all right.

16:43.869 --> 16:46.497
- Well, Mr. Madsen...
- Dr. Madsen...

16:46.572 --> 16:49.973
Oh, really? Great. Then I can
put this a little more simply.

16:50.042 --> 16:54.775
You had a catecholamine-induced,
super-ventricular tachyarrhythmia.

16:54.847 --> 16:58.374
I'm actually a dentist, so I
have no idea what you just said.

16:58.450 --> 17:01.078
- Stress-induced panic attack.
- I'm not stressed.

17:01.153 --> 17:04.384
Your body says otherwise.
We see this a lot in middle-aged men.

17:04.455 --> 17:07.516
- I'm not middle-aged.
- We hear that a lot, too.

17:07.593 --> 17:09.857
How 'bout we get you
out of here in a few minutes?

17:09.928 --> 17:12.556
<i>Dr. Wesley to imaging.
Dr. Wesley to imaging.</i>

17:12.631 --> 17:14.291
I am a middle-aged man,
aren't I?

17:14.366 --> 17:17.893
Only mathematically.

17:17.970 --> 17:20.530
I think you need to let off some steam.

17:20.606 --> 17:22.767
You used to love to travel.

17:22.840 --> 17:25.275
No, Doug, you used to play hockey.
You were crazy.

17:25.344 --> 17:27.574
You don't even
sing annoying eighties music.

17:27.646 --> 17:29.011
Well, it's different now.

17:29.081 --> 17:32.414
You know, I had to slow down
for... for you and Billy.

17:32.484 --> 17:34.384
Oh, so I'm the one
who did this to you?

17:34.453 --> 17:35.511
I'm in a hospital.

17:35.587 --> 17:38.556
It's easier for me now to blame
other people for my problems.

17:38.624 --> 17:42.890
W... I think you should
go on that trip.

17:42.961 --> 17:46.021
If you don't, I will fire up
the hog and go with the guys.

17:46.098 --> 17:48.931
- Woody doesn't have a plan.
- Yeah, but he never does.

17:49.001 --> 17:50.901
It's like taking a trip to nowhere.

17:52.271 --> 17:54.501
Maybe that's exactly what you need.

18:00.679 --> 18:02.442
What up?

18:02.514 --> 18:06.644
Hey. You're late! Supposed to
be here at eight-thirty, guys.

18:06.718 --> 18:09.687
Hey, look here,
if Karen calls,

18:09.755 --> 18:14.215
OK, I'm at a toilet
bowl seminar in Cleveland.

18:14.293 --> 18:16.693
Hey, no, I'm serious.

18:16.762 --> 18:18.252
I need y'all to cover for me.

18:18.330 --> 18:20.423
Yeah, sure.

18:21.433 --> 18:24.300
What? What?
What are you looking at?

18:24.369 --> 18:25.495
I got a tat.

18:25.571 --> 18:27.334
- Come on!
- Hell just froze over.

18:27.406 --> 18:29.738
- Let's see it!
- I'm a biker, dude!

18:29.808 --> 18:31.435
I got a tat!

18:31.510 --> 18:34.479
- It's an apple.
- Uh, Dudley, you know...

18:34.546 --> 18:37.879
I know: Trademarked.
But what are they gonna say?

18:37.950 --> 18:40.851
It's in my skin, bitch!

18:42.988 --> 18:46.219
- You guys aren't gonna wear helmets?
- I don't wanna wear a helmet.

18:46.291 --> 18:48.782
Maybe I don't want anything
between me and the road.

18:48.861 --> 18:50.488
You will if your head falls on it.

18:50.562 --> 18:53.793
Woody, 62 percent of motorcycle
fatalities can be prevented with

18:53.866 --> 18:56.198
- the use of an approved DOT helmet.
- That right?

18:56.268 --> 18:59.533
What's that leather condom
gonna protect you from? Snoopy?

18:59.605 --> 19:01.402
The Red Baron? How about dating?

19:01.473 --> 19:03.373
- You told me you liked it.
- Guys, hey!

19:03.442 --> 19:07.276
There are no rules on this trip.
We're just heading for the Pacific,

19:07.346 --> 19:10.747
- and there ain't no plans.
- Well, we got a week to do this, right?

19:10.816 --> 19:12.909
I figure we gotta be
in Illinois by tonight.

19:12.985 --> 19:15.545
Well, the way I mapped it out,
we should be 100 miles

19:15.621 --> 19:17.816
- past St. Louis by sundown.
- Good.

19:17.890 --> 19:20.415
What did I say?
I said it's the open road, OK?

19:20.492 --> 19:23.620
- Who knows where we're gonna be?
- I know where we're gonna be.

19:23.695 --> 19:26.186
Dudley hooked me up.
Check out this thing.

19:26.265 --> 19:27.994
It's a GPS in my phone now.

19:28.066 --> 19:29.931
- Look at that.
- No kidding? Let me see.

19:30.002 --> 19:31.333
- Cool!
- What are you...

19:32.204 --> 19:34.934
- Hey, what'd you do that for?!
- For the good of the trip.

19:35.007 --> 19:37.908
You don't need a GPS
to discover America.

19:37.976 --> 19:40.001
You need a bike and
you need the road, OK?

19:40.078 --> 19:42.842
Freedom. And if we have an
emergency, I got a cell phone.

19:42.915 --> 19:44.143
- No you don't.
- What?

19:44.216 --> 19:47.617
Hey! Why did you do that?
I got all my data in there!

19:47.686 --> 19:49.881
Well, how does that feel, Woody?

19:51.256 --> 19:53.724
Feels good. Whoo!

19:53.792 --> 19:56.283
<i># It's my prerogative!
Mm-mm-mm! #</i>

19:56.361 --> 19:58.022
- No cell phones!
- Wait a minute.

19:58.096 --> 20:00.360
- Come on, get rid of it.
- No, Doug, he's right.

20:00.432 --> 20:02.730
- No, no, wait, wait...
- Whoo!

20:02.801 --> 20:05.861
Yeah! Yeah, Wild Hogs, baby!
Wild Hogs!

20:05.938 --> 20:07.906
You did that so
Karen wouldn't call you.

20:07.973 --> 20:09.497
- Exactly.
- Come on, give it up.

20:09.575 --> 20:13.375
So we're not gonna discuss this? We're
not gonna think about this? No, don't!

20:13.445 --> 20:15.208
- We need one phone.
- Freedom, baby!

20:18.083 --> 20:21.246
We gotta go.

20:22.721 --> 20:24.848
- Go, go!
- Come back here!

20:25.791 --> 20:28.894
<i>[# Grand Funk Railroad: Walk Like A Man</i>

20:28.894 --> 20:30.862
<i>[# Grand Funk Railroad: Walk Like A Man</i>

20:52.851 --> 20:54.250
- Hey!
- Whoo!

20:54.319 --> 20:55.718
Where're you guys headed?

20:57.990 --> 20:59.582
I love you!

21:01.493 --> 21:03.552
You're hot!

21:23.315 --> 21:25.909
- Losers.
- Look at these guys.

21:27.953 --> 21:29.250
Hey.

21:29.321 --> 21:32.848
You guys wanna a ride?

21:36.361 --> 21:39.057
Well, all right.
Sleeping bags are all set.

21:42.134 --> 21:45.262
Bobby, I got two words
for you: Foot pump.

21:45.337 --> 21:49.068
Woody, I got four words for you:
Got a cheap-ass wife.

21:50.409 --> 21:54.175
Hey, guys, this is poop.
So don't eat it.

21:54.246 --> 21:56.407
- Oh, God.
- Excuse me, Mr. Hard Drive,

21:56.481 --> 21:58.813
you're supposed to bury it,
not put it in a bag.

21:58.884 --> 22:01.444
This is plastic,
I'm not gonna put it in the earth.

22:01.520 --> 22:03.317
I'll find a garbage can tomorrow.

22:05.157 --> 22:08.957
So you gonna sit right next to me
with that doo-doo.

22:10.896 --> 22:13.558
Hey, come on.
Doesn't get any better than this.

22:13.632 --> 22:17.534
Sitting around a fire, chilling with
your best friends, relaxing, enjoying...

22:17.602 --> 22:19.866
Sorry, you gotta...
You gotta bury that thing.

22:19.938 --> 22:22.964
- Otherwise I'll vomit in your lap.
...each other's company.

22:23.041 --> 22:25.635
I'll hang it from a tree
so the bears don't get it.

22:25.711 --> 22:28.339
- No, don't hang it in a tree!
- Why not?

22:28.413 --> 22:32.349
'Cause bears don't eat shit!

22:37.522 --> 22:38.819
What's up?

22:40.559 --> 22:43.050
Ever wake up and wonder
what happened to your life?

22:44.329 --> 22:45.956
I really had such great plans.

22:46.031 --> 22:49.899
My life and my work
would be an adventure. You know?

22:49.968 --> 22:51.868
All of a sudden
I'm a suburban dentist.

22:51.937 --> 22:53.837
Hey, look, Doug,
I feel your pain, man.

22:53.905 --> 22:56.806
Look, I swore I would
never return to a job

22:56.875 --> 23:00.038
where I had to wear
condoms on my shoes.

23:00.112 --> 23:01.739
- You're still at The Firm?
- Yeah.

23:01.813 --> 23:05.340
And I get yelled at
by an ungrateful wife all night.

23:05.417 --> 23:08.386
- The whole thing has made me...
- A wimp.

23:08.453 --> 23:11.980
I was gonna say miserable.
But you think I'm a wimp?

23:12.057 --> 23:14.924
No, I thought you were gonna say wimp,
so I just filled it in.

23:14.993 --> 23:17.723
You're a wimp, Bobby.
I... I'll say it.

23:17.796 --> 23:21.061
I mean, you're afraid of women.
It's kind of embarrassing.

23:21.133 --> 23:23.761
- I'm afraid of women.
- You're afraid to talk to women.

23:23.835 --> 23:25.393
Bobby's afraid they'll kill him

23:25.470 --> 23:27.734
in his sleep.

23:27.806 --> 23:31.037
Wow. Now I'm really
afraid of women.

23:31.109 --> 23:33.236
At least one of us
is living the fairy tale.

23:33.311 --> 23:35.836
Right, Woody? Plenty of money,
travel all the time,

23:35.914 --> 23:37.745
you got the swimsuit model
for a wife.

23:37.816 --> 23:39.807
At least one of us
has got it made.

23:39.885 --> 23:43.048
Yeah, Well, one man's fairy tale
is another man's nightmare.

23:44.656 --> 23:47.056
You think that the
marshmallow's done, Doug?

23:47.125 --> 23:51.357
Oh. Hey, look at that. Anybody
want the first marshmallow?

23:51.430 --> 23:54.263
Starting to look like
Dudley's helmet.

23:56.334 --> 23:57.323
All right.

23:58.970 --> 24:01.905
- I think I'm halfway there.
- Oh, in only one hour?

24:01.973 --> 24:03.838
Hey, Bobby, you sure
you wanna do that?

24:03.909 --> 24:06.878
You could use one of the spare
bags we got in the... tent!

24:06.945 --> 24:09.379
Hey, Dudley, go get
the water jug out of my bag!

24:09.448 --> 24:11.382
I want... Kick, kick,
kick, kick! Dirt!

24:11.450 --> 24:12.542
I got it!

24:12.617 --> 24:14.744
That's camp-stove fuel!

24:17.022 --> 24:18.182
No!

24:19.324 --> 24:20.621
This is the wrong jug!

24:20.692 --> 24:22.023
You think?

24:22.994 --> 24:24.052
Aw, God.

24:24.129 --> 24:26.154
This is supposed to be flame-retardant.

24:26.231 --> 24:28.222
I guess it wasn't
"Dudley-retardant."

24:30.669 --> 24:33.069
All my drawers are burning.

24:35.040 --> 24:36.632
Oh, perfect!

24:51.756 --> 24:52.950
What are you doing?

24:53.024 --> 24:55.254
Huh? Keeping my face
out of the wind.

24:56.628 --> 25:01.292
Hey. Oh.
Boy, my ass is sore.

25:01.366 --> 25:02.890
Mine, too.

25:02.968 --> 25:06.062
It's Woody's fault
for riding us so hard yesterday.

25:06.137 --> 25:10.130
The human body wasn't made to straddle
something that big for that long.

25:10.208 --> 25:14.372
Well, you know, it's gonna hurt a little
bit, and that's part of the experience.

25:14.446 --> 25:16.346
That's why we didn't bring our wives.

25:16.414 --> 25:18.814
What the...
What the hell?

25:18.884 --> 25:22.479
Somebody wanna explain to me
why I'm the one in the dirt...

25:22.554 --> 25:25.352
...when I got sore jaws
from three hours of blowing...

25:27.425 --> 25:32.362
Please, please for the love
of God, finish your sentence.

25:36.268 --> 25:37.997
Let's see, what, uh...

25:38.069 --> 25:39.661
What exactly
do we have here?

25:39.738 --> 25:41.069
We've got...

25:41.139 --> 25:45.974
...one, two, three men...
in a bed... spooning?

25:46.044 --> 25:47.636
This is not what it looks like.

25:47.712 --> 25:50.647
This is a, uh... We, um...
What is it, Woody?

25:50.715 --> 25:51.704
Camping.

25:51.783 --> 25:54.946
I'll tell you just exactly
what it is there, Poindexter.

25:55.020 --> 25:57.887
It is four counts
of indecent exposure,

25:57.956 --> 26:01.119
two counts of lewd,
lascivious behavior, and...

26:02.027 --> 26:05.656
...one count...
of pure jealousy.

26:05.730 --> 26:09.188
- Huh?
- How you doing?

26:09.267 --> 26:10.825
- Hey, look.
- Whoa, we're not...

26:10.902 --> 26:12.767
Thanks for waking us up,
Officer.

26:12.837 --> 26:16.329
- Oh, it was actually...
- I get it. You gotta get going.

26:16.408 --> 26:17.534
That's terrific.

26:17.609 --> 26:19.873
Five's a crowd? Is that
what I'm gleaning here?

26:19.945 --> 26:23.346
Yeah, five's... uneven number.
Figure it out.

26:23.415 --> 26:25.883
You guys can't see it, can you?
You're too close.

26:25.951 --> 26:29.443
You don't realize how lucky
you are to have each other.

26:29.521 --> 26:33.548
Oh, daddy... Damn lucky.

26:35.393 --> 26:38.260
- I've always felt so.
- I know what you've felt.

26:38.330 --> 26:40.628
I have too.

26:53.044 --> 26:56.036
- You wearing pants?
- No.

26:56.114 --> 26:58.810
Would you please put some
pants on, for God's sake!

26:58.883 --> 27:00.510
Dudley!

27:00.585 --> 27:01.950
What a nice guy.

27:04.089 --> 27:06.819
Mmm.
Oh, yeah.

27:07.826 --> 27:09.817
Whoo! Anybody else
gotta take a leak?

27:09.894 --> 27:11.088
- No.
- No.

27:11.162 --> 27:13.323
Hey, guys, last
stop for quite a while.

27:13.398 --> 27:16.799
I gotta pee again now.

28:05.083 --> 28:08.246
Wow. I can
smell them from here.

28:08.319 --> 28:11.948
Gentlemen,
that's the real deal.

28:43.221 --> 28:44.381
Ahh.

28:45.490 --> 28:47.048
What?

28:48.259 --> 28:51.956
Now, that's "wild!"

29:14.953 --> 29:17.046
Oh! Whoa, stop it!

29:17.122 --> 29:19.113
Biker in trouble!

29:39.811 --> 29:41.506
This is awesome!

29:44.415 --> 29:47.043
Thanks for
waiting for me, jerks!

29:47.619 --> 29:49.712
Yoo-hoo!

29:50.989 --> 29:53.617
Oh, it's...
Whoa, it's cold!

29:54.926 --> 29:57.554
- What?
- Why are you naked?

29:57.629 --> 30:00.257
We're swimming. Did you guys
keep your skivvies on?

30:00.331 --> 30:02.629
There could be snapping
turtles or something.

30:02.700 --> 30:05.635
I kept mine on 'cause I didn't
want it to get dark in here.

30:05.703 --> 30:08.797
I don't know, I thought we were
doing this wild and free thing.

30:08.873 --> 30:10.033
Yeah, well...

30:11.876 --> 30:14.344
More like, old and lame,
isn't it?

30:14.412 --> 30:17.210
The high guy would've just
ripped 'em right off, you know,

30:17.282 --> 30:19.477
back in the... back in the day.

30:19.551 --> 30:22.782
- But the day's today, isn't it?
- This isn't necessary.

30:22.854 --> 30:26.551
Yeah, come on.
Come on! Huh?

30:28.092 --> 30:31.255
Now you see what you started?
You even got Doug out of his drawers.

30:31.329 --> 30:33.320
What the hell,
you know what I mean?

30:33.398 --> 30:35.195
But everybody
keep their distance.

30:35.266 --> 30:38.497
I don't want the whole size
thing to ruin our friendship.

30:38.570 --> 30:41.562
Launching mine.
Over your head, baby.

30:41.639 --> 30:43.630
Whew. You guys are nuts.

30:48.980 --> 30:50.811
Come on! Huh?

30:50.882 --> 30:55.512
Fine. I will
get naked with my gay friends,

30:55.587 --> 30:58.886
and if any of them look at
my junk, I will kill them.

31:02.227 --> 31:04.627
Gentlemen, these are
the good old days.

31:12.437 --> 31:14.769
Come on, kids!
Come on!

31:14.839 --> 31:17.069
- Whoo!
- Oh, no.

31:17.141 --> 31:18.904
Last one in
smells like Uncle Eddie!

31:18.977 --> 31:20.638
Aw, hell no.

31:20.712 --> 31:23.977
Hope you guys don't mind company.
Minivan was getting crowded.

31:24.048 --> 31:28.041
There's a much shallower creek
for kids just up the canyon a bit.

31:28.119 --> 31:29.711
Oh, no, my kids like to dive.

31:29.787 --> 31:31.584
Marky, show this guy your dive.

31:31.656 --> 31:34.819
If you put your arms out, he
does a backflip right into them.

31:34.893 --> 31:36.861
No! Don't do that,
it's not a good idea.

31:36.928 --> 31:38.486
Oh, hello.

31:38.563 --> 31:40.292
You gentlemen like potato salad?

31:40.365 --> 31:41.525
We've got extra.

31:41.599 --> 31:43.931
But, uh, you might wanna
eat that way over there.

31:44.002 --> 31:45.902
Uh, less ants and snakes.

31:45.970 --> 31:47.961
The kids are coming.
The kids are coming.

31:48.039 --> 31:50.064
No... Oh, whoa. Guys,
you can't swim here.

31:50.141 --> 31:52.609
Crawfish, big crawfish,
they're snapping... Ow!

31:52.677 --> 31:54.167
Crawfish!

31:54.245 --> 31:55.803
Lemme see if I can catch one!

31:56.814 --> 31:59.112
You see? He's
looking for crawfish!

31:59.183 --> 32:01.083
- I told you!
- He's gonna find a couple!

32:01.152 --> 32:02.517
Where is he?

32:07.458 --> 32:09.722
Marky! Cooper! Ava!

32:09.794 --> 32:11.762
Let's, uh, let's get
out of the water.

32:11.829 --> 32:13.797
- Find a new spot.
- Why, Hugh?

32:13.865 --> 32:15.730
This is such a nice...

32:16.801 --> 32:18.860
Oh, my God.

32:18.937 --> 32:21.770
- I didn't wanna do this.
- Out of the water! Now!

32:21.839 --> 32:23.272
Kids, listen to your dad.

32:23.341 --> 32:25.138
- No!
- Aw! We just got here!

32:25.209 --> 32:28.303
Get out of the damn water, now!
Run! Run! Run! Go!

32:28.379 --> 32:31.871
Take it. Take it! What's wrong
with these people? Come on, go!

32:31.950 --> 32:34.612
I'll bet her potato salad
was really good.

32:36.955 --> 32:39.116
- Maybe we should go.
- Yeah, let's go.

32:39.190 --> 32:40.589
Why? They ain't coming back!

32:40.658 --> 32:45.925
Fellas!
Forget about them!

32:45.997 --> 32:50.024
More room for us, huh?
Come on!

32:50.101 --> 32:53.002
You like what you see?
Huh? Let's get involved!

32:59.744 --> 33:02.804
Whoo! Now that's
what I'm talking about!

33:02.880 --> 33:04.313
Whoo!

33:04.382 --> 33:07.681
I saw your bikes
over there and I...

33:09.487 --> 33:11.421
Chicken fights, fellas?

33:12.523 --> 33:14.957
No? Plan B...

33:16.194 --> 33:18.389
- Marco...
- Polo.

33:18.463 --> 33:21.330
Mar... Marco...

33:21.399 --> 33:25.199
Marco!

33:51.529 --> 33:53.224
Thank you so much!

33:53.297 --> 33:56.892
And, uh, I left
a window open, all right?

34:35.306 --> 34:38.935
Oh, yeah.
Now, this is a biker bar.

34:39.010 --> 34:40.909
I'm buying, let's go.

34:43.014 --> 34:46.245
I hope they have bran muffins.
I'm a little bound up.

34:51.089 --> 34:53.956
My damn leg's asleep!

34:54.025 --> 34:56.083
Oh, it's got an emblem, too.
An FLH emblem.

34:56.159 --> 34:58.060
That is rare, man. Rare.

34:58.129 --> 35:01.030
- Can you see this?
- Oh, man. That's beautiful.

35:02.200 --> 35:04.395
- What's wrong with you?
- My legs are asleep.

35:17.381 --> 35:19.315
How 'bout this one?

35:19.383 --> 35:21.715
Yeah.

35:23.187 --> 35:24.677
You guys want beers?

35:24.755 --> 35:27.883
I gotta find that guy with the
'55 bike, man. It is beautiful.

35:29.193 --> 35:32.993
Nice tat.
Where'd you get it?

35:33.064 --> 35:36.158
Leavenworth. You?

35:36.234 --> 35:38.293
Meadow Hills Galleria.

35:45.009 --> 35:48.274
I don't think I've ever seen
you guys around here before.

35:48.813 --> 35:50.371
What's your, uh...

35:50.448 --> 35:52.814
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Wild Hogs.

35:52.884 --> 35:54.784
That the name
of your little gang?

35:54.852 --> 35:58.015
Not a gang. We're friends
riding from Cincinnati to the coast.

35:58.089 --> 36:00.353
Hey, man. We in your seats?

36:00.424 --> 36:02.358
- No.
- Nah, 'cause we could just...

36:02.426 --> 36:04.986
No. No, no,
n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-no.

36:05.062 --> 36:09.158
...we'll roll out.
- No, n-n-no. No. I insist. Sit.

36:09.233 --> 36:10.598
- Sit?
- Sit. I insist.

36:10.668 --> 36:13.136
I think I'm gonna
join you fellas.

36:13.204 --> 36:15.138
Actually, we have a...

36:15.206 --> 36:16.935
Yeah, let's join them.

36:17.008 --> 36:20.967
Make ourselves some
nice new little friends.

36:21.045 --> 36:22.535
- Nice patch.
- Yeah.

36:22.613 --> 36:25.480
Did you get your grandmother
to needlepoint that for you?

36:25.550 --> 36:28.542
Well, what's... what's going on
with you there, uh, Cochise?

36:28.619 --> 36:30.382
What's your story?

36:37.962 --> 36:40.487
Wh... What is that
supposed to be? Is he blind?

36:40.565 --> 36:42.294
He wasn't when he
walked in here.

36:42.366 --> 36:43.993
Hey! I'm talking to you!

36:44.068 --> 36:46.536
- You hear me?
- He can hear fine.

36:46.604 --> 36:49.072
Look, we're...
We don't want any trouble.

36:49.140 --> 36:52.507
I do.

36:52.577 --> 36:56.707
Actually, that's what
I'm looking forward to the most.

36:57.848 --> 36:59.839
That's what he's
looking forward to!

36:59.917 --> 37:03.080
I heard him say that. I heard him.

37:05.790 --> 37:06.848
Shut up.

37:09.760 --> 37:11.819
All right.

37:11.896 --> 37:14.387
You're looking for trouble?

37:16.701 --> 37:18.692
You gotta be careful
about Bobby here.

37:18.769 --> 37:20.600
His temper's like
a Roman candle.

37:20.671 --> 37:23.333
Man...
That's a damn lie!

37:23.407 --> 37:25.898
On the other hand,
Woody over here,

37:25.977 --> 37:28.502
you get him mad,
people get broke.

37:29.981 --> 37:31.608
Doug makes kids cry.

37:31.682 --> 37:34.549
- What?
- Yeah. You make kids cry.

37:34.619 --> 37:36.018
You made my child cry.

37:36.087 --> 37:38.021
Your kid was crying
before she got to me.

37:38.089 --> 37:40.489
Yeah. But I asked you
to give her a lollipop. Be...

37:40.558 --> 37:42.788
- It calms her down.
- You can't give a lolli...

37:42.860 --> 37:45.328
- All right, shut up!
- You know what?

37:45.396 --> 37:47.261
I think we better get out of here.

37:47.331 --> 37:49.959
No. We'll get
out of here at sundown.

37:50.034 --> 37:51.865
After we've had our beverage.

37:51.936 --> 37:54.461
Sundown, Hoss? What?

37:54.538 --> 37:59.771
These are on me. You got
the mocha lattes yesterday.

37:59.844 --> 38:01.505
- Ah...
- Hey, brother.

38:01.579 --> 38:06.243
- Another Wild Hog!
- Yep.

38:06.317 --> 38:09.309
Yep-er-oonie.
That's our gang.

38:09.387 --> 38:13.619
Hey, uh, who owns that
'48 Panhead outside?

38:13.691 --> 38:15.283
Uh, that's my '48.

38:15.359 --> 38:17.452
Sweet ride.

38:17.528 --> 38:21.430
And I'm sick of it.
How 'bout a trade there, brother?

38:21.499 --> 38:23.967
- Dudley. Dudley, Dudley.
- Oh. I wish.

38:24.035 --> 38:26.595
I'm just on a Sportster.
Worth half of what yours is.

38:26.671 --> 38:28.832
A Sportster?
I grew up on a Sportster!

38:28.906 --> 38:30.806
I've been wanting another Sportster!

38:30.875 --> 38:33.366
Oh? No, no, no.
It's even better than that.

38:33.444 --> 38:35.344
In the gas tank
is one of my shoelaces.

38:35.413 --> 38:38.974
I dropped it in there when I was
trying to get my calculator watch out.

38:39.850 --> 38:41.374
- Dudley?
- Dudley.

38:41.452 --> 38:43.613
Dudley...
You got a deal.

38:43.688 --> 38:47.283
- Seriously? You're serious?
- Think. He's not gonna trade the bike.

38:47.358 --> 38:49.588
Dudley, I wanna see
what you look like on that.

38:49.660 --> 38:51.355
You're on.

38:51.429 --> 38:53.920
Ah! Dudley!
Dudley, no. No, wait a minute.

38:53.998 --> 38:55.522
We gotta trade...

38:55.599 --> 38:57.226
Yo, check this out.

38:57.301 --> 39:00.202
Does anybody else get
that "pre-rape" feeling?

39:00.271 --> 39:04.173
I do.

39:07.011 --> 39:09.445
Oh, oh, this is great!

39:09.513 --> 39:11.811
No, no, no, no, no, no.
This is Joker's Panhead.

39:11.882 --> 39:13.873
I thought we were
talking about this one.

39:13.951 --> 39:15.782
Hey, your Panhead is over here.

39:15.853 --> 39:17.718
Oh. I was talking about...

39:17.788 --> 39:20.484
Nah, no, no, no, no.
I got a better one for you.

39:20.558 --> 39:24.050
It's right over here.
The red one, the Panhead.

39:24.128 --> 39:25.595
- Where?
- Right there.

39:25.663 --> 39:27.927
That's a Panhead.
There're no other Panheads.

39:27.998 --> 39:29.192
- That?
- Yeah.

39:29.266 --> 39:30.961
That's a pile of junk.

39:31.035 --> 39:33.663
Yeah. That's your pile of junk.

39:38.676 --> 39:41.201
- This guy's joking you.
- You wanna know the joke?

39:41.278 --> 39:43.906
The joke is suburban assholes
who buy leather outfits

39:43.981 --> 39:47.382
who think they're bikers.
And it's a joke that I'm damn sick of.

39:47.451 --> 39:50.215
You wanna know who
a real biker is? Damien Blade.

39:50.287 --> 39:53.120
He founded the Del Fuegos
and he built this bar

39:53.190 --> 39:55.385
for real bikers, not this!

39:55.459 --> 39:57.017
Hey, we have a right
to be bikers.

39:57.094 --> 39:59.722
You don't have any rights.
Shut up! I knew you assholes

39:59.797 --> 40:02.425
the minute I laid eyes on you.
Look at the four of you!

40:02.500 --> 40:04.968
- You don't know us.
- You don't think I know you?

40:05.035 --> 40:07.469
What? You're probably a...
a podiatrist

40:07.538 --> 40:09.870
or a ear-nose-and-throat specialist.

40:09.940 --> 40:11.840
- I wish.
- Orthodontist?

40:11.909 --> 40:14.605
Oh. Close enough.

40:14.678 --> 40:17.306
And you, Bobby,
guaranteed you're henpecked.

40:17.381 --> 40:20.179
- Right? Your wife wears the pants.
- You know my wife?

40:20.251 --> 40:22.776
And you, you anal-retentive wimp,

40:22.853 --> 40:25.219
guarantee you bag your own shit.

40:25.289 --> 40:27.052
Wow, you're good.

40:27.124 --> 40:29.524
- What color am I thinking of?
- Shut up.

40:30.761 --> 40:32.626
You're the biggest
poser of them all,

40:33.431 --> 40:35.023
aren't you, squinty?

40:35.933 --> 40:38.367
Go home. Just go home.

40:38.436 --> 40:40.904
Go home. You couldn't
handle this freedom anyhow.

40:40.971 --> 40:43.371
Get out of here.
Go back to your safe little lives.

40:43.441 --> 40:45.500
Let's get our bikes.
We'll get out of here.

40:45.576 --> 40:48.136
You're not listening.
I'm taking your friend's bike

40:48.212 --> 40:50.373
and you guys are gonna
hit the road and go back

40:50.448 --> 40:53.246
to wherever the hell it is
that you came from. Understand?

40:53.317 --> 40:55.410
We're gonna have to
work something out.

40:55.486 --> 40:59.047
All right.
Let's work something out.

41:13.871 --> 41:16.931
Hey! What's going on?
Something break?

41:17.007 --> 41:19.942
- What's up, man? What's up?
- This is bullshit, man.

41:20.010 --> 41:22.240
We should go back there
and get Dudley's bike.

41:22.313 --> 41:24.611
That's why we're stopping?
What are you, nuts?

41:24.682 --> 41:26.081
We're gonna call the police.

41:26.150 --> 41:28.015
I gotta borrow somebody's cell phone.

41:28.085 --> 41:30.110
Einstein had us
throw 'em away, remember?

41:30.187 --> 41:31.950
Hey, look, man,
damn the bike.

41:32.022 --> 41:34.422
He's gonna have to roll
with that little sidecar.

41:34.492 --> 41:36.585
- Right.
- Let's get up outta here, man.

41:36.660 --> 41:40.255
Come on. The trip is over 'cause
some tattooed bullies pushed us around?

41:40.331 --> 41:41.491
Yeah.

41:42.933 --> 41:43.922
I go where you go.

41:44.001 --> 41:45.696
Good. See? He's got balls.

41:45.769 --> 41:47.999
No. I mean my sidecar's
attached to your bike.

41:48.072 --> 41:50.870
I'd rather turn back.
But, honestly, how far could I roll?

41:50.941 --> 41:52.431
I'm not gonna
let this happen.

41:52.510 --> 41:54.341
I say we go back
and we get his bike.

41:54.411 --> 41:55.639
- You?
- Yeah.

41:55.713 --> 41:59.274
Who died and elected you pope? This
isn't about Dudley, this is about you.

41:59.350 --> 42:02.148
You, you. All through high school
it's always about you,

42:02.219 --> 42:03.982
- and I am sick of it!
- Oh, screw you.

42:04.054 --> 42:05.817
It's not my fault
you hate your life.

42:05.890 --> 42:08.825
- I love my life. Why do you...?
- Let me tell you something!

42:08.893 --> 42:11.054
This trip's supposed
to be about adventure!

42:11.128 --> 42:14.256
But no. You're too busy dragging
your baggage to let that happen.

42:14.331 --> 42:16.196
Well, thank you, Dr. Freud.

42:16.267 --> 42:18.201
Look, I'm not going back
to get that bike

42:18.269 --> 42:20.794
to satisfy your bruised ego.
Are you guys with me?

42:20.871 --> 42:22.771
- Oh, I'm with you.
- Yeah, I agree.

42:22.840 --> 42:25.570
There you go, Woody.
We're not going back there with you.

42:25.643 --> 42:27.941
Should we go after him?

42:28.012 --> 42:29.479
Probably.

42:29.547 --> 42:32.038
- Are we going to?
- Nope.

43:30.774 --> 43:33.299
Come after us now, assholes.

43:53.330 --> 43:55.764
- I'll be a son of a gun.
- Oh, snap!

43:57.001 --> 43:58.935
You did it!
You got her back!

43:59.003 --> 44:01.335
- Woo-hoo!
- Ha-ha!

44:01.405 --> 44:02.667
Who's your daddy?!

44:02.740 --> 44:05.231
- You are my daddy!
- Yeah, that's right, baby.

44:05.309 --> 44:07.243
Aw, man!

44:07.311 --> 44:09.541
- Thank you!
- How'd you do it?

44:09.613 --> 44:12.241
OK, they were
totally pissed off.

44:12.316 --> 44:14.546
So I take a new tact. Reality.

44:14.618 --> 44:17.416
So I said to 'em,
"OK, assault us. No problem.

44:17.488 --> 44:19.115
Because we may not be
real bikers,

44:19.189 --> 44:21.749
but we know real lawyers.
And as soon as you touch us,

44:21.825 --> 44:24.350
we'll sue you for everything
you got and everything

44:24.428 --> 44:26.487
you're gonna have."
And they backed down.

44:26.563 --> 44:28.622
They totally backed down.
It was awesome.

44:28.699 --> 44:30.667
- You really said that?
- Yeah!

44:30.734 --> 44:32.167
My man!

44:32.236 --> 44:34.727
- Show me love. Show me love.
- Yeah!

44:34.805 --> 44:37.365
Hey, guess what.
The trip's back on.

44:37.441 --> 44:38.908
- It's back on!
- The trip is on!

44:38.976 --> 44:41.001
Wait. We're gonna
go back that way, then?

44:41.078 --> 44:42.340
Yeah, they don't care.

44:42.413 --> 44:45.974
We should just do it before
they change their minds.

44:46.050 --> 44:49.019
- Pacific Ocean, here we come!
- Whoo!

44:49.086 --> 44:51.486
<i>Highway to Hell]</i>

45:01.665 --> 45:04.896
Son of a bitch.
Come on. Come on!

45:23.153 --> 45:25.348
Thanks, guys!

45:30.894 --> 45:33.419
Those assholes got balls.

45:33.497 --> 45:36.193
That I'm gonna put in
my mouth and chew on!

45:37.534 --> 45:39.968
You're gonna put what
in your mouth?

45:42.072 --> 45:44.939
Come on! Del Fuegos,
let's smoke those hogs!

45:45.008 --> 45:46.771
- Let's go!
- Come on!

45:56.687 --> 45:58.348
What the hell...?
Aw, shit!

45:58.422 --> 46:01.687
Fire, fire!
Fire, everybody.

46:01.759 --> 46:03.454
Hey! Fire,
come on, get off!

46:03.527 --> 46:04.755
Fire, fire!
Get away.

46:04.828 --> 46:06.853
Come on!

46:06.930 --> 46:09.524
Get out of there!
Get out of there!

46:25.215 --> 46:28.116
Oh, shit!

46:28.819 --> 46:31.652
Oh, God. Oh, no.

46:33.991 --> 46:36.050
Come on. Let's go!

46:36.126 --> 46:38.754
What's your rush?
My balls are still vibrating.

46:38.829 --> 46:40.854
It's... It's the open road, man.

46:40.931 --> 46:42.660
It's riding free,
that's the rush.

46:42.733 --> 46:44.826
This isn't freedom,
this is a gas station!

46:44.902 --> 46:47.393
Built by the man!
A prison for our souls!

46:47.471 --> 46:49.098
My soul needs
something to drink.

46:49.173 --> 46:50.231
I need gas.

46:50.307 --> 46:51.934
We'll get gas at the next station.

46:52.009 --> 46:54.705
Come on, Wild Hogs. Let's go!

46:54.778 --> 46:57.303
Whoo-hoo! Let's ride!

46:57.381 --> 46:59.679
Did I miss the espresso stop?

46:59.750 --> 47:02.651
He's moving.

47:02.719 --> 47:05.483
Yahoo!

47:27.010 --> 47:28.773
Woody! You're an asshole.

47:28.846 --> 47:30.609
They should've had
a sign that said,

47:30.681 --> 47:33.081
"Last gas X amount of miles."

47:37.187 --> 47:39.621
I need something to drink.

47:39.690 --> 47:42.625
I'm thirsty...
Or else I'm gonna die!

47:42.693 --> 47:46.390
Yeah. You know,
I keep... saving my spit

47:46.463 --> 47:47.862
so it's like a drink of water,

47:47.931 --> 47:50.024
and it just keeps
tasting like... my spit.

47:50.100 --> 47:52.159
They say you can get

47:52.236 --> 47:55.205
something to drink
out of a cactus, right?

47:55.272 --> 47:57.069
Where are the cactuses?

47:57.140 --> 47:59.802
We're in a desert
that don't have no damn cactuses.

47:59.877 --> 48:01.139
Yeah.

48:01.211 --> 48:05.147
Actually, I think
when it's plural, it's "cacti."

48:05.215 --> 48:07.479
- I'm killing him.
- You're gonna kill him?

48:07.551 --> 48:10.042
We're all thinking it.
Gonna need the nourishment.

48:10.120 --> 48:11.678
He'll put up the least struggle.

48:11.755 --> 48:13.985
- Move out of the way.
- You love Dudley.

48:14.057 --> 48:16.252
It's the sun.
It's making us all crazy.

48:16.326 --> 48:19.762
You're right, man.
My... my bad, Dud.

48:19.830 --> 48:21.855
You know, I don't know
what came over me.

48:21.932 --> 48:25.424
Dehydration. Your blood's thickening,
so your heart's working harder

48:25.502 --> 48:28.232
to pump it through your arteries.
Less gets to your head.

48:28.305 --> 48:30.933
Our bodies are literally
trying to drink themselves.

48:31.008 --> 48:32.703
All right. I'm killing him.

48:32.776 --> 48:35.006
Wait a minute.
They got a sign up here.

48:35.078 --> 48:36.909
Curve of the road.
Read it!

48:36.980 --> 48:39.972
- Madrid? Spain?
- No. It's Madrid.

48:40.050 --> 48:42.075
That's what the locals say.
I Googled it.

48:42.152 --> 48:44.848
Gonna be water, food and gas.

48:44.922 --> 48:48.790
- We're gonna live.
- We gonna live!

48:48.859 --> 48:51.350
We gonna live, baby!

48:55.465 --> 48:57.092
It's closed!

48:57.167 --> 48:59.533
Ah, man! It's closed!

48:59.603 --> 49:02.128
But the diner up here...

49:02.205 --> 49:04.799
The diner's open!
Come on!

49:04.875 --> 49:07.867
Get me a drink, quick!

49:07.945 --> 49:09.606
- We need water!
- Quick!

49:09.680 --> 49:12.080
- Hey! Come on!
- Right here. Right here!

49:12.149 --> 49:13.138
Whoa!

49:13.216 --> 49:16.652
- Oh! Right here! Me!
- Me! Me!

49:16.720 --> 49:18.312
- You?
- Me!

49:21.825 --> 49:24.885
- Hey!
- You!

49:24.962 --> 49:28.159
They were here three weeks ago.
They're already getting violent.

49:28.231 --> 49:30.665
It's OK, I got it.

49:35.105 --> 49:37.665
- You gentlemen like a seat?
- Is there a booth open?

49:37.741 --> 49:39.538
Let's go!

49:39.609 --> 49:41.008
- Yeah. Uh, what?
- Come on.

49:42.479 --> 49:45.243
- Keep moving!
- Uh, nice town.

49:48.652 --> 49:53.817
So, uh, I...

49:54.624 --> 49:56.182
Uh...

50:03.266 --> 50:06.633
- She is perfect.
- You like the waitress?

50:06.703 --> 50:09.763
Oh, man. I wanted to say
something funny to her,

50:09.840 --> 50:11.774
but all I could think
of was black jokes.

50:12.909 --> 50:15.810
- Like which ones?
- I forget.

50:15.879 --> 50:19.508
Why don't you tell the one that ends
with you getting your ass whupped?

50:19.583 --> 50:22.381
- Would that be funny?
- I'll be laughing.

50:22.452 --> 50:25.148
Oh, I'll be cracking up.

50:25.222 --> 50:29.124
Oh, it's the law. Oh, boy.

50:34.798 --> 50:37.961
- You boys here for the Chile Festival?
- What, you have a problem?

50:38.035 --> 50:41.368
You look like you saw something
explode or something, all right.

50:41.438 --> 50:42.871
We're just passing through.

50:42.939 --> 50:46.534
The people around here
don't want any more trouble.

50:46.610 --> 50:49.135
Now me, I got no problem
with you Del Fuegos

50:49.212 --> 50:51.544
as long as you boys
could stay sober...

50:51.615 --> 50:54.709
No, no. No, we're... we're not
associated with those assholes.

50:54.785 --> 50:56.377
- You're not?
- No.

50:56.453 --> 50:57.977
- For real?
- Yeah.

50:58.055 --> 51:01.456
Folks, they're not Del Fuegos.

51:03.560 --> 51:05.892
Are the Del Fuegos
a problem around here?

51:05.962 --> 51:08.624
Only if you expect 'em
to pay for a meal they just ate

51:08.698 --> 51:10.165
or a beer they just drank.

51:10.233 --> 51:12.098
- Won't have problems with us.
- No, no.

51:12.169 --> 51:15.366
- Then welcome to Madrid.
- Excuse me, sheriff?

51:15.439 --> 51:17.566
- Uh, the Del Fuegos?
- Yeah.

51:17.641 --> 51:21.077
OK, now. How often might
they come through this town?

51:21.144 --> 51:23.169
Oh, once every few months.

51:23.246 --> 51:24.713
- Oh?
- Yeah. Yeah.

51:24.781 --> 51:27.272
And... the gas station,
now when would that be open?

51:27.350 --> 51:29.682
That's closed on Sundays.
So tomorrow morning.

51:29.753 --> 51:31.152
Oh, God.

51:31.221 --> 51:34.713
But maybe you should seriously
consider spending the night.

51:34.791 --> 51:38.192
Because we're having
the world's hottest chili contest.

51:38.261 --> 51:41.094
The Chile Festival is not
something you wanna miss.

51:41.164 --> 51:43.962
Last year, somebody's throat
actually started to bleed.

51:44.034 --> 51:47.526
Oh, damn!
Somebody's throat started to bleed?

51:47.604 --> 51:49.401
Yeah. Changed their life.

51:49.473 --> 51:51.805
It's great. Think about it.

51:53.243 --> 51:56.906
We gotta get out of this town, man.
This town is a drag. We gotta move on.

51:56.980 --> 51:59.312
- We gotta find a way out.
- Woody, chill out, man.

51:59.382 --> 52:01.407
We finally get a chance to relax.

52:01.485 --> 52:03.385
Yeah. And being able
to use a bathroom,

52:03.453 --> 52:06.081
- that might be a good idea.
- And I can empty my poop bag.

52:06.156 --> 52:08.124
And you gonna re-use the bag?

52:08.191 --> 52:10.125
Woody, remember
the theme of this trip?

52:10.193 --> 52:11.990
"Whatever," remember?
"Whatever."

52:12.062 --> 52:13.359
OK, fine! Fine.

52:13.430 --> 52:16.228
We'll stay the night,
and we'll get gas in the morning. OK?

52:16.299 --> 52:18.767
Calm down.
I don't understand what your rush is.

52:18.835 --> 52:21.565
I'm not in a rush, man.
I just wanna ride, man.

52:21.638 --> 52:23.196
I just wanna ride. You know?

52:23.273 --> 52:25.537
<i># Ride, Sally, ride #</i>

52:25.609 --> 52:29.170
You are so weird. He asks the...
You say the weirdest things, man.

52:29.246 --> 52:32.613
You're like, "We're digging roots,
buying real estate and shit."

52:32.682 --> 52:35.378
Yeah. Why don't you just...

52:35.452 --> 52:38.012
What?! What?

52:46.062 --> 52:47.654
All right, everybody come here.

52:47.731 --> 52:49.631
Come on.

52:51.968 --> 52:54.300
All right.

52:54.371 --> 52:55.861
We're here. Right?

52:55.939 --> 52:59.067
They could be in any of these towns.
Right around here. All right?

52:59.142 --> 53:01.337
We're gonna find them,
we're gonna get 'em.

53:01.411 --> 53:02.673
I don't know, Jack.

53:02.746 --> 53:05.613
I mean, by my calculations...
I'm thinking,

53:05.682 --> 53:07.775
if they're four hours
ahead of us, we can...

53:07.851 --> 53:11.184
Shut up! Anybody else wanna
tell me how hard this is gonna be?

53:11.254 --> 53:13.779
Huh? Any other naysayers?

53:13.857 --> 53:17.554
Good. I want you to
break up into two-man teams.

53:17.627 --> 53:19.686
You call me when you find 'em.

53:50.860 --> 53:54.023
Oh, snap.
A softball pitch.

53:54.097 --> 53:56.395
You... I gotta win
something for my girls.

53:56.466 --> 53:58.627
Wait a minute.
You think you're good at this?

53:58.702 --> 53:59.999
Oh, I know I'm good at this.

54:00.070 --> 54:03.437
Hey, on my Little League team,
they used to call me "Bull's Eye Bobby."

54:03.506 --> 54:05.440
- Yeah.
- 'Cause I had pinpoint control.

54:05.508 --> 54:06.497
Right.

54:06.576 --> 54:09.204
A hundred forty-four innings,
never walked a batter.

54:09.279 --> 54:10.769
Watch me work, baby.

54:10.847 --> 54:12.246
- Here you go.
- How you doin'?

54:12.315 --> 54:13.543
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

54:13.617 --> 54:15.847
All right, Bull's Eye Bobby, folks!

54:17.654 --> 54:19.986
Bull's Eye Bobby, baby.

54:20.957 --> 54:23.858
It's probably been, what?
Twenty-eight years, Bulls Eye?

54:30.567 --> 54:33.058
- Hey.
- Hi.

54:34.070 --> 54:36.061
So, um...

54:37.507 --> 54:39.634
- Excuse me?
- Never mind.

54:39.709 --> 54:42.940
- So you like chili?
- Oh, yeah. Not the hot stuff.

54:43.013 --> 54:45.481
But you put a nice,
mild turkey chili in front of me?

54:45.548 --> 54:46.947
Oh, yeah, I'm gonna eat it.

54:47.017 --> 54:49.747
That's too bad 'cause
I wanted you to try mine, but...

54:49.819 --> 54:51.878
...it's pretty hot.
- No, I'll try it!

54:51.955 --> 54:55.789
I like your kinda hot. The...
In your chili. The chili hot. Food hot.

54:55.859 --> 54:58.657
That's the kinda hot
I wanna kiss. Eat.

55:00.130 --> 55:01.995
OK. If you're sure
you can handle it.

55:02.065 --> 55:04.761
Handle it? I'm a biker.

55:04.834 --> 55:06.825
- What'd you call him?
- Bull's Eye Bobby!

55:06.903 --> 55:08.302
Bull's Eye Bobby, baby.

55:08.371 --> 55:11.169
- Yeah, Bull's Eye. Yep.
- Ha-ha-ha!

55:12.642 --> 55:15.008
Oh...

55:17.113 --> 55:21.743
- I guess that counts as a walk?
- I'm gonna sit.

55:38.702 --> 55:40.135
Mmm.

55:40.203 --> 55:42.694
Smooth. Tasty.

55:42.772 --> 55:45.297
Little... spice.

55:45.375 --> 55:47.843
It gets a little hotter
as it sits in your throat.

55:48.778 --> 55:51.042
You OK?

55:51.114 --> 55:52.342
Mm.

55:52.415 --> 55:54.713
You want some of this?
lt'll cool you down.

55:59.389 --> 56:01.721
Don't worry, your throat
won't actually bleed.

56:01.791 --> 56:05.283
I understand.

56:09.265 --> 56:12.792
Mother of God!
I swallowed hot lava!

56:20.443 --> 56:22.240
Hundred and forty-four innings,

56:22.312 --> 56:24.177
you never hit anybody
in the crotch?

56:24.247 --> 56:26.579
Not on purpose, man, all right?
You all right?

56:26.649 --> 56:30.016
- Yeah, it's... Good fastball.
- Hey. I'd like you boys

56:30.086 --> 56:32.350
to meet my deputies,
Earl and Buck Dooble.

56:32.422 --> 56:34.413
- How are you, Earl?
- I'm Earl. He's Buck.

56:34.491 --> 56:36.891
- Earl, Buck.
- Now, just remember:

56:36.960 --> 56:40.259
Brother with the word "ear" in his name
has got both on his head.

56:42.165 --> 56:44.929
See, I can only say that
'cause I'm on his right side,

56:45.001 --> 56:47.333
which, as you can see,
is mostly blown off.

56:47.404 --> 56:49.565
- You say something?
- I did not.

56:49.639 --> 56:52.938
Needless to say,
we don't carry firearms anymore.

56:53.009 --> 56:55.136
I mean, sometimes
you pull 'em out,

56:55.211 --> 56:57.771
you think they're not loaded,
and then sometimes...

56:57.847 --> 56:59.610
They blow your
deputy's ear off?

56:59.682 --> 57:01.616
Yeah.

57:04.053 --> 57:06.112
What brings you boys
on this trip, anyway?

57:06.189 --> 57:09.158
Firstly, we had to get away, OK?

57:09.225 --> 57:11.659
And secondly, you know,
you just never know

57:11.728 --> 57:14.253
how many more summers
you've got left.

57:14.330 --> 57:17.788
- Do you?
- Wow. That's deep.

57:17.867 --> 57:19.732
I just came on this trip,

57:19.803 --> 57:22.567
you know, hoping to reclaim
the old Doug, you know?

57:22.639 --> 57:26.097
You know, I know
exactly what you mean.

57:26.176 --> 57:30.169
You know, you can never let life
get too stagnant or too safe.

57:30.246 --> 57:31.838
Every now and then you gotta do

57:31.915 --> 57:35.043
what we folks around here
like to call "Slap the Bull."

57:35.118 --> 57:36.312
"Slapping the Bull"?

57:36.386 --> 57:38.946
That's just a little game we play

57:39.022 --> 57:41.923
to make sure your life
is not controlled by fear.

57:41.991 --> 57:43.686
Yeah, I wanna do that.

57:43.760 --> 57:45.853
Oh, come on, guys.
We're exhausted.

57:45.929 --> 57:48.625
I think we should just put
the bikes in back of the hotel,

57:48.698 --> 57:52.395
in a shed with the doors closed,
perhaps, and then play Scrabble

57:52.469 --> 57:54.733
in the... in the room
with the shades down.

57:54.804 --> 57:58.171
Look, Aunt Bee, maybe you wanna do
something else here in Mayberry.

57:58.241 --> 57:59.230
Yeah.

57:59.309 --> 58:02.904
- How 'bout a little Bull Slap?
- Sounds like something I could win at.

58:02.979 --> 58:04.913
- Yeah.
- I'll take a little Bull Slap.

58:04.981 --> 58:07.415
Look, Bull Slap for everybody.
Line 'em up.

58:07.484 --> 58:09.884
- Let's have a little Bull Slap.
- We'll do it!

58:11.087 --> 58:13.317
So literally, we're gonna slap a bull?

58:13.389 --> 58:17.655
Yep. Right on the ass. And then you're
gonna wanna hightail it outta there.

58:17.727 --> 58:19.285
- Why?
- 'Cause he can kill you.

58:19.362 --> 58:20.852
- Mm-hmm.
- Perfect.

58:20.930 --> 58:23.262
Hey, man, I thought
this was a drinking game.

58:23.333 --> 58:25.961
Yeah, you know, you got
a lot of animals I would slap.

58:26.035 --> 58:28.833
A chicken, I'd slap a chicken.
Or a goat, maybe.

58:28.905 --> 58:30.600
A ferret, I'd slap, you know?

58:30.673 --> 58:32.800
But I'm not...
I'm not gonna slap a bull.

58:32.876 --> 58:35.709
Oh, come on, Doug.
It was your idea. Get in there!

58:35.778 --> 58:38.178
I didn't know we...
Look at the nuts on that thing!

58:38.248 --> 58:39.237
Come on!

58:39.315 --> 58:41.476
- It's not safe.
- Not safe. Know what?

58:41.551 --> 58:44.486
- You snooze, you lose. I'm going.
- Getting ready to do that?

58:44.554 --> 58:46.146
- Yep!
- Oh!

58:46.222 --> 58:49.214
You jackass. Go ahead, Woody.
Hope you're wearing a cup.

58:50.894 --> 58:53.488
- Right on the ass.
- He looks confident.

58:53.563 --> 58:54.894
Easy.

59:04.274 --> 59:05.639
Whoa!

59:05.708 --> 59:08.836
Come on, get back, now!

59:10.947 --> 59:12.346
Way to get back!

59:12.415 --> 59:15.009
I just slapped
a big fat bull on the ass!

59:15.084 --> 59:17.348
That was awesome! Who's next?

59:17.420 --> 59:19.650
- Uh, Doug?
- Doug?

59:19.722 --> 59:21.713
Yeah, no,
that'd be you, yeah.

59:21.791 --> 59:23.088
Come on, Doug. Do it!

59:23.159 --> 59:24.751
It's... it... you could...

59:24.827 --> 59:26.317
That's really an, um...

59:26.396 --> 59:28.421
Doug, go.

59:28.498 --> 59:30.591
- Come on, man!
- Handle your business.

59:30.667 --> 59:32.658
- It was easy.
- I'm not gonna...

59:32.735 --> 59:34.566
Yeah, come on! It's fun!

59:35.471 --> 59:37.462
Old days, Doug. Old days.

59:37.540 --> 59:39.735
All right, all right,
I'm gonna slap a bull.

59:39.809 --> 59:41.800
- I'm gonna slap that bull.
- There you go.

59:41.878 --> 59:43.937
- That's my Doug!
- There he goes.

59:44.981 --> 59:46.915
Just slap it right there
on the rear end?

59:46.983 --> 59:49.645
Right on the hind haunches.

59:51.854 --> 59:54.084
You know, this is so good for Doug.

59:54.157 --> 59:56.182
- Actually, it's good for all of us.
- Yeah.

59:56.259 --> 59:58.124
Hey, thanks for bringing us here.

59:58.194 --> 59:59.957
Sure. Glad we could help.

01:00:00.029 --> 01:00:02.725
Yeah, and we never
seen it done twice in a row.

01:00:02.799 --> 01:00:03.959
- Mm-mmm.
- What?

01:00:04.033 --> 01:00:06.695
Be interesting to see how
the bull takes being slapped

01:00:06.769 --> 01:00:09.135
- now that he's alert.
- Mm-hmm.

01:00:09.205 --> 01:00:10.638
Alert?

01:00:13.710 --> 01:00:15.610
Get back!

01:00:15.678 --> 01:00:17.305
- Hurry!
- Hey! Come on.

01:00:20.883 --> 01:00:22.680
Ow!

01:00:24.454 --> 01:00:27.617
He coming back!

01:00:28.858 --> 01:00:29.882
Bull!

01:00:29.959 --> 01:00:33.156
He coming back!
He coming back! Oh...!

01:00:33.229 --> 01:00:36.926
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Ah! He almost got me!

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.366
Come on! What's this bully want?
Come on, bully!

01:00:39.435 --> 01:00:42.427
You don't wanna use mockery!
That never works!

01:00:42.505 --> 01:00:43.938
Cowboy's in trouble!

01:00:45.141 --> 01:00:47.302
Maybe if you just
try to reason with it!

01:00:47.377 --> 01:00:49.777
- He's coming back for more! Look out!
- Whoa!

01:00:49.846 --> 01:00:53.009
He's more afraid of you
than you are of him!

01:00:53.082 --> 01:00:54.515
Watch out!

01:00:54.584 --> 01:00:56.415
Watch out, watch out.
Come on!

01:00:56.486 --> 01:00:58.386
- Come on, let's go, let's go!
- Oh!

01:01:02.825 --> 01:01:04.292
What?!

01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:08.763
- Yeah, man, this is living!
- Yeah, we slapped a bull on the ass!

01:01:08.831 --> 01:01:10.196
- Yes, sir!
- Yeah!

01:01:10.266 --> 01:01:12.166
Yeah, you sure did.

01:01:12.235 --> 01:01:15.466
- You sure did!
- Hey, did y'all see my moves?

01:01:15.538 --> 01:01:18.598
I was shaking and baking
just like the NFL, baby!

01:01:18.675 --> 01:01:20.506
You hear what I'm saying?

01:01:20.576 --> 01:01:23.807
I delivered it
right to the end zo...!

01:01:42.298 --> 01:01:44.858
- Hey, look at him.
- He threw Bobby ten feet in the air.

01:01:44.934 --> 01:01:47.630
Hey, man, that damn bull
kept following me around.

01:01:47.704 --> 01:01:51.037
- You think it was my cologne?
- What are you wearing, Rodeo Clown?

01:01:51.107 --> 01:01:52.802
- Hold on...
- So now you got jokes?

01:01:52.875 --> 01:01:55.105
Hey, Woody, you know,

01:01:55.178 --> 01:01:58.909
I apologize for saying you had
ego issues earlier. All right?

01:01:58.981 --> 01:02:00.539
I'm sorry I called you a pussy.

01:02:02.251 --> 01:02:04.515
You didn't call me a pussy.

01:02:04.587 --> 01:02:07.920
No, not to your face,
but that's what I was thinking!

01:02:07.990 --> 01:02:11.221
Hey, we're just saying how much fun
this trip's turned out to be.

01:02:11.294 --> 01:02:14.024
I was so close this time!
So close!

01:02:14.230 --> 01:02:15.663
What's the matter, Dudley?

01:02:16.232 --> 01:02:18.257
The waitress. I think she likes me.

01:02:18.334 --> 01:02:20.325
- Good.
- No, it's not good.

01:02:20.403 --> 01:02:22.394
She told me to meet her
on the dance floor.

01:02:22.472 --> 01:02:23.837
- So?
- So? Go dance.

01:02:23.906 --> 01:02:27.103
I can't go on the dance floor.
You know what I look like.

01:02:27.176 --> 01:02:29.838
The music moves me,
but it moves me ugly.

01:02:29.912 --> 01:02:32.745
Well, do that... sprinkler thing
you did at my wedding.

01:02:32.815 --> 01:02:34.612
- Yeah.
- I can't do the sprinkler.

01:02:34.684 --> 01:02:37.016
I've gotta... I need to...

01:02:38.921 --> 01:02:40.354
- No.
- Yes.

01:02:40.423 --> 01:02:41.720
I said no.

01:02:41.791 --> 01:02:44.851
Why don't we keep it simple,
why don't we just, uh...

01:02:44.927 --> 01:02:47.862
We'll do the lindy.
I'll be the guy, you be the girl.

01:02:47.930 --> 01:02:50.421
There we go.
And it's just... Remember?

01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:52.764
- OK. Yeah, right.
- It's one and two

01:02:52.835 --> 01:02:55.235
and three and four,
and turn her around,

01:02:55.304 --> 01:02:57.568
- and start over again.
- Do it two times, and...

01:02:57.640 --> 01:02:59.437
- Whatever you want.
- I'll be the guy.

01:02:59.509 --> 01:03:01.568
- Be the guy, I'll be the girl.
- OK. Ready.

01:03:01.644 --> 01:03:04.477
And one and two
and three and four.

01:03:04.547 --> 01:03:08.449
One and two and three and four,
and turn me around and...

01:03:08.518 --> 01:03:10.850
- Oh, yeah! Now we're...
- Oh, OK, that's enough.

01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:13.582
- That's, uh, good lesson.
- What? No, wait. Is that it?

01:03:13.656 --> 01:03:16.216
- Yeah, that's enough.
- That's just a pocket knife.

01:03:18.227 --> 01:03:20.559
There she is.
You're ready. Go.

01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:22.530
- Yeah, let's do it.
- I'm ready.

01:03:22.598 --> 01:03:24.725
You're ready.
Come on. Go.

01:03:52.028 --> 01:03:53.359
Yeah!

01:03:59.435 --> 01:04:01.403
- Whoo!
- Check it out.

01:04:11.747 --> 01:04:13.715
- Oh!
- Ahh!

01:04:13.783 --> 01:04:15.512
Oh! Whoa, whoa.

01:04:18.888 --> 01:04:20.412
He's panicking.

01:04:49.819 --> 01:04:52.344
Hey! That's my phone!

01:04:52.421 --> 01:04:54.446
Your minutes just expired.

01:04:55.925 --> 01:04:59.383
- Baby! Baby, it's Murdock.
- Tell me you found them.

01:04:59.462 --> 01:05:02.022
We did. They're in Madrid.

01:05:02.098 --> 01:05:05.534
Good! Good, good,
good, good. I like Madrid!

01:05:05.601 --> 01:05:07.569
The ground is soft enough
to bury them.

01:05:07.637 --> 01:05:09.605
You want us to
smack 'em around a little?

01:05:09.672 --> 01:05:11.071
<i>No! No! Listen to me!</i>

01:05:11.140 --> 01:05:13.472
You just make sure
they stay there. OK?

01:05:13.542 --> 01:05:15.567
But do not touch them.
They're mine.

01:05:15.645 --> 01:05:18.011
I wanna feel their
bones break under my fists.

01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:19.775
Sounds like
a good beating, Jack.

01:05:19.849 --> 01:05:21.817
We'll leave 'em for you, then.

01:05:23.386 --> 01:05:26.446
Anyone else want some
Wild Hog for breakfast?

01:05:27.924 --> 01:05:31.018
Yee-ha!

01:05:33.529 --> 01:05:35.861
You expect me to pay
for this piss-warm beer?

01:05:35.932 --> 01:05:38.366
Here, you can have it back.

01:05:42.939 --> 01:05:45.339
If we drank piss,
we'd drink it cold!

01:05:46.742 --> 01:05:47.902
What?!

01:05:49.178 --> 01:05:51.043
Wait, guys, guys,
guys, guys, look...

01:05:51.113 --> 01:05:53.104
We don't drink piss!

01:05:54.784 --> 01:05:56.752
Hey, hey.

01:05:56.819 --> 01:05:59.151
Hey, Woody.
Maybe it's time to give these guys

01:05:59.221 --> 01:06:00.950
another one of your famous talks.

01:06:01.023 --> 01:06:04.652
I think we just avoid them, OK?
I've handled this legally. We should go.

01:06:04.727 --> 01:06:07.787
You know what? I'm talking
to these assholes this time, Woody.

01:06:07.863 --> 01:06:09.490
You shouldn't have to do it twice.

01:06:09.565 --> 01:06:12.261
You took care of them
the last time, and I just sat there.

01:06:12.335 --> 01:06:15.532
But this time, you know what?
They wanna see rage? Watch me.

01:06:15.604 --> 01:06:17.469
- Bobby, Bob...
- Whoa!

01:06:18.207 --> 01:06:19.606
Hey, assholes!

01:06:19.675 --> 01:06:22.872
You boys got a hell of a lot of trouble
coming. You know that, right?

01:06:22.945 --> 01:06:24.207
I'm gonna tell you again,

01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:27.807
like my friend told your stupid-ass,
cracker-ass, inbred buddies...

01:06:27.883 --> 01:06:29.350
Did he just say "cracker"?

01:06:29.418 --> 01:06:31.079
- "Cracker-ass."
- Oh, perfect.

01:06:31.153 --> 01:06:34.020
You touch us, and we'll
sue your ass so hard,

01:06:34.090 --> 01:06:36.456
you'll be taking out
a loan just to piss.

01:06:36.525 --> 01:06:40.586
Now, if that ain't clear enough
for you, maybe this is: Splash.

01:06:40.663 --> 01:06:42.654
Huh? Got it?
Did I get it in your mouth?

01:06:42.732 --> 01:06:45.633
Splash! Splash! Splash!
Did I get you on some of that?

01:06:45.701 --> 01:06:47.328
You crossed
a little line there.

01:06:47.403 --> 01:06:50.236
No, no, no, no, no!
It ain't worth it, man.

01:06:50.306 --> 01:06:51.967
Jack'll kill us if we touch him.

01:06:52.041 --> 01:06:53.975
- So just...
- Break some of that up.

01:06:54.043 --> 01:06:55.874
Got a little treat for you.

01:06:55.945 --> 01:06:57.708
Huh? Break a little of that up.

01:07:00.416 --> 01:07:02.611
Can you hear that?
Can you hear that?

01:07:02.685 --> 01:07:04.846
Uhh! Uhh!

01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:06.649
Uhhh!

01:07:06.722 --> 01:07:09.691
- That's not a discussion.
- No, that's a lawsuit.

01:07:11.627 --> 01:07:15.393
- Aw, look at that.
- What?!

01:07:17.933 --> 01:07:19.161
That's gonna stain.

01:07:19.235 --> 01:07:22.830
Ha! You boys look like you
belong on a couple of hot dogs.

01:07:22.905 --> 01:07:24.736
Now,

01:07:24.807 --> 01:07:29.335
If there's any other Del Fuegos
that need that message repeated,

01:07:29.412 --> 01:07:31.437
you tell them
that the Wild Hogs...

01:07:35.084 --> 01:07:36.915
...are right here in Madrid, baby...

01:07:36.986 --> 01:07:38.954
...ready to explain it again.

01:07:39.021 --> 01:07:41.285
You got that?

01:07:41.357 --> 01:07:43.052
I said you got that?!

01:07:44.860 --> 01:07:46.953
Sweet mother of mercy!

01:07:47.029 --> 01:07:48.860
Huh?!

01:07:50.466 --> 01:07:54.698
He don't want it.
He don't want it. I'm hungry.

01:07:56.772 --> 01:07:58.000
Let's evacuate! Come on!

01:08:02.812 --> 01:08:05.975
- Beer, here!
- Wild Hogs, I gotta tell you,

01:08:06.048 --> 01:08:08.243
you don't know
how many broken windows

01:08:08.317 --> 01:08:09.841
you guys saved this town.

01:08:09.919 --> 01:08:13.355
Sheriff, it's the least we could do
for our new friends here in Madrid.

01:08:13.422 --> 01:08:15.720
- Right, Bobby?
- Wild Hogs!

01:08:15.791 --> 01:08:18.089
Wild Hogs!

01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:19.923
That's some good work
you did there.

01:08:19.995 --> 01:08:21.223
Hey, thank you, sheriff.

01:08:21.296 --> 01:08:24.663
Now look, you know, if you need
something done, just come to me.

01:08:24.733 --> 01:08:27.292
You know what I mean?
'Cause I will beat shit down.

01:08:27.368 --> 01:08:29.394
Let's say them peanuts
are bothering you.

01:08:29.471 --> 01:08:31.804
Huh? I don't wanna hear it!
I don't wanna hear it!

01:08:31.874 --> 01:08:34.843
What'd the sheriff tell you?
What'd the town people tell you?

01:08:34.910 --> 01:08:37.377
What the...?
You know what I mean?

01:08:37.446 --> 01:08:40.846
I ain't got no problem with it.
I ain't got no problem with it.

01:08:40.916 --> 01:08:44.113
Yeah. Yeah.
That's all right.

01:08:44.185 --> 01:08:47.484
This is great. Right, Woody?

01:08:47.555 --> 01:08:50.548
- Huh?
- You all right?

01:08:53.362 --> 01:08:54.350
Yeah...

01:08:55.831 --> 01:08:57.298
- I'm gonna call Kelly.
- Yeah.

01:08:57.366 --> 01:08:59.630
Remind her just what
kind of a stud she married.

01:08:59.702 --> 01:09:02.569
All right,
yeah, you do that.

01:09:05.908 --> 01:09:07.375
Hey, hey, Bobby!

01:09:07.443 --> 01:09:09.604
Next time, I handle
those bozos, eh?

01:09:09.678 --> 01:09:12.442
The wrath of Dudley!
Wild Hogs!

01:09:12.515 --> 01:09:14.642
Wild Hogs!

01:09:14.716 --> 01:09:17.151
Tequila, on the Wild Hogs.

01:09:20.656 --> 01:09:23.022
In New Mexico.
We actually slapped a bull.

01:09:23.091 --> 01:09:24.957
Slapped it right on the ass.

01:09:25.027 --> 01:09:27.154
You have no idea
how turned on I am right now,

01:09:27.229 --> 01:09:29.697
- but please be careful.
- We're like celebrities.

01:09:29.765 --> 01:09:32.029
- Well, Bobby is.
- Man, I crush them cashews.

01:09:32.100 --> 01:09:34.126
- Macadamia nuts?
- Oh, macadamia nut?

01:09:34.203 --> 01:09:35.430
I'd kick it out the park.

01:09:35.504 --> 01:09:38.166
Hey! And guess who
dropped by to say hello.

01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:40.731
Karen. Yeah, I think
she's feeling a little lonely.

01:09:40.809 --> 01:09:42.401
- Who's that?
- It's Doug.

01:09:42.478 --> 01:09:44.639
Says they're having
a great time on the trip.

01:09:44.712 --> 01:09:46.475
Kelly, don't tell her
about the...

01:09:46.549 --> 01:09:48.038
Road trip?!

01:09:50.685 --> 01:09:52.950
Hey! Dudley,
don't you wanna come inside?

01:09:53.022 --> 01:09:55.183
I'm fine. I'm just gonna, um,

01:09:55.257 --> 01:09:57.953
sit out here
for a little while, I think.

01:09:58.027 --> 01:10:00.052
OK. You OK?

01:10:00.863 --> 01:10:03.593
I'm fine. I'm... uh...

01:10:07.169 --> 01:10:08.659
No, the truth is I'm not OK.

01:10:08.737 --> 01:10:11.001
The truth is I like you a lot, Maggie.

01:10:13.676 --> 01:10:16.236
I'm liking you a lot too.

01:10:16.312 --> 01:10:19.406
See, that's what I was afraid of.

01:10:20.449 --> 01:10:22.974
That you would like me
without knowing...

01:10:23.052 --> 01:10:25.282
Without me telling you...

01:10:28.624 --> 01:10:30.717
I'm not a cool biker, Maggie.

01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:33.960
I'm not a cool anything.

01:10:34.029 --> 01:10:35.758
I'm a computer programmer.

01:10:35.831 --> 01:10:37.992
I'm just a geek.

01:10:38.901 --> 01:10:42.564
I'm sorry if you thought
I was somebody that I'm not.

01:10:49.712 --> 01:10:52.909
Mm-mm. You're not a geek.

01:10:56.685 --> 01:10:59.017
- You're a lot of fun.
- Hmm.

01:11:01.924 --> 01:11:04.654
And you're really honest.

01:11:07.796 --> 01:11:09.991
And you're really sweet.

01:11:13.769 --> 01:11:16.499
You're the kind of guy
that's hard to find.

01:11:24.413 --> 01:11:26.711
Sorry.

01:11:26.782 --> 01:11:28.909
Try again. One more time.

01:11:34.056 --> 01:11:36.388
All right, Bobby!
All gassed up!

01:11:37.893 --> 01:11:41.659
- Whoo! All gassed up, baby!
- All right. Let's get Dudley. Let's go!

01:11:41.730 --> 01:11:43.357
- Clive, what's up?
- Hey! My man!

01:11:43.432 --> 01:11:45.627
What you know? No good?
All right. OK.

01:11:45.701 --> 01:11:48.727
We're going to high altitudes.
We should check tire pressure.

01:11:48.804 --> 01:11:50.465
Whoa, no, no, little buddy.

01:11:50.539 --> 01:11:52.473
We gotta ride.
We gotta get going, OK?

01:11:52.541 --> 01:11:54.941
We got new experiences
and new locations, right?

01:11:55.010 --> 01:11:57.945
We can't leave, man.
I'm like the mayor of this town.

01:11:58.013 --> 01:12:00.641
- My people need me.
- I said we're leaving!

01:12:01.750 --> 01:12:02.978
Hey, guys.

01:12:03.052 --> 01:12:05.077
We decided we wanna
have breakfast here.

01:12:05.154 --> 01:12:07.349
Come on! Hey, cowboy!
Let's saddle up, OK?

01:12:07.423 --> 01:12:09.653
You're burning daylight. Let's go!

01:12:09.725 --> 01:12:11.716
Got a problem with
hanging a few minutes?

01:12:11.794 --> 01:12:13.489
Do I look like
I have a problem? Do I?

01:12:13.562 --> 01:12:14.927
- Yeah.
- Yes.

01:12:14.997 --> 01:12:17.397
There you go again.
Saying the weirdest shit.

01:12:28.677 --> 01:12:30.907
Del Fuegos!
Hide the bikes! Quick!

01:12:30.979 --> 01:12:33.209
- Why, why?
- Just do it! Trust me!

01:12:33.282 --> 01:12:37.048
What's wrong?
Why are we hiding?

01:12:37.119 --> 01:12:39.781
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

01:12:50.632 --> 01:12:52.827
- Oh, God!
- Hey! Why are we hiding?

01:12:52.901 --> 01:12:55.028
You took care of this
already, didn't you?

01:12:55.104 --> 01:12:56.696
No, not like you think, OK?

01:12:56.772 --> 01:12:59.240
Well, what is it that I think?

01:12:59.308 --> 01:13:01.469
I didn't really talk to them, OK?

01:13:01.543 --> 01:13:04.011
- You serious?
- I knew something was wrong.

01:13:04.079 --> 01:13:06.070
Dudley, you're like,
"I'm all stupid...

01:13:06.148 --> 01:13:07.172
Not Dudley's fault!

01:13:07.249 --> 01:13:09.740
...take my bike, give me
a piece of junk, I'm happy."

01:13:09.818 --> 01:13:11.809
You're all,
"I'm scared. Let's get out."

01:13:11.887 --> 01:13:13.286
- Whatever.
- It's our fault?

01:13:13.355 --> 01:13:15.346
The Del Fuegos are all,
"You're nothing.

01:13:15.424 --> 01:13:17.517
- We're real bikers."
- This isn't about us!

01:13:17.593 --> 01:13:19.584
- What did you do?
- What did you do, Woody?

01:13:20.629 --> 01:13:23.223
I...

01:13:24.099 --> 01:13:26.932
I cut the gas lines
of their bikes.

01:13:27.669 --> 01:13:28.966
And then I...

01:13:29.037 --> 01:13:32.063
- What?
- Maybe blew up their bar.

01:13:32.141 --> 01:13:33.904
- Oh!
- Ah, perfect!

01:13:33.976 --> 01:13:36.877
- Oh, we're dead!
- Oh, come on!

01:13:36.945 --> 01:13:39.243
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!

01:13:39.314 --> 01:13:41.748
That means they're
just here to kill us.

01:13:47.456 --> 01:13:49.686
No sign of 'em, Jack.

01:13:53.262 --> 01:13:55.287
Wild Hogs!

01:13:55.364 --> 01:13:58.424
Come out, come out,
wherever you are!

01:13:58.500 --> 01:14:00.968
I finally meet a girl,
and now I'm gonna die.

01:14:01.036 --> 01:14:03.231
So all the mustard
and the ketchup...

01:14:03.305 --> 01:14:05.239
...didn't help the situation, huh?

01:14:05.307 --> 01:14:07.104
Ohhh!

01:14:07.176 --> 01:14:10.839
Oh, you don't
wanna come out? We'll wait!

01:14:11.914 --> 01:14:14.246
There's only one road
out of this town!

01:14:14.316 --> 01:14:16.250
We own it!

01:14:16.318 --> 01:14:20.084
Me and my boys will be
in this lovely little diner here!

01:14:20.155 --> 01:14:24.819
Get out of here!
The longer you keep us waiting,

01:14:24.893 --> 01:14:29.262
the worse it's gonna get for
the peaceful town of Madrid!

01:14:33.202 --> 01:14:37.002
Jack! I'm going
to ask you not to.

01:14:37.072 --> 01:14:38.903
What did you say,
you little turd?

01:14:38.974 --> 01:14:40.965
- What did he say?
- He called him a turd.

01:14:43.045 --> 01:14:44.979
Let's go!

01:14:45.047 --> 01:14:47.277
Enjoy.

01:14:47.349 --> 01:14:48.873
OK, I made a mistake.

01:14:48.951 --> 01:14:51.977
Woody, we could have just
went home, man, and been fine.

01:14:52.054 --> 01:14:54.579
Yeah, well, you know,
maybe I don't have a home.

01:14:54.656 --> 01:14:56.590
Claudia left me.

01:14:56.658 --> 01:14:58.853
Three months ago she left.

01:14:58.927 --> 01:15:01.452
And then I fell apart.
Lost my clients.

01:15:01.530 --> 01:15:03.464
And then I lost my job.

01:15:03.532 --> 01:15:06.194
Now I got to sell the house
and I got to sell the car.

01:15:06.268 --> 01:15:08.600
Can't even get
the lawn raked, you know.

01:15:08.670 --> 01:15:11.264
I just got the bike and I got
you guys. That's all I got.

01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:14.036
So this trip is
all about you running away

01:15:14.109 --> 01:15:17.135
from your miserable, screwed-up life?

01:15:17.212 --> 01:15:19.874
And you screw up our lives?

01:15:19.948 --> 01:15:21.279
Asshole!

01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:25.582
I'm sorry about your situation,
Woody, but you're a lying asshole.

01:15:25.654 --> 01:15:28.680
- Which is like an asshole's asshole.
- I thought that...

01:15:28.757 --> 01:15:32.420
I thought that being a Wild Hog
meant something. But clearly it doesn't.

01:15:32.494 --> 01:15:35.019
You don't care about me!
That's fine. I don't care.

01:15:35.097 --> 01:15:37.156
It doesn't mean anything, Woody!

01:15:37.232 --> 01:15:39.291
Remember, it's just
a patch my wife made!

01:15:39.368 --> 01:15:41.461
We should go somewhere
to yell at each other

01:15:41.537 --> 01:15:43.698
where there aren't people
trying to kill us.

01:15:49.111 --> 01:15:50.601
Hey, Maggie.

01:15:52.514 --> 01:15:54.573
Thanks for letting us
hide in your house.

01:15:54.650 --> 01:15:55.776
Yeah, thanks.

01:15:55.851 --> 01:15:59.116
It's hard not to when you're
screaming and kicking down the door.

01:15:59.187 --> 01:16:00.677
Hey.

01:16:00.756 --> 01:16:02.223
You OK?

01:16:02.291 --> 01:16:05.021
Mm. Yeah.
Diner's the only thing I have.

01:16:05.093 --> 01:16:07.618
If that gets destroyed, it's...

01:16:07.696 --> 01:16:11.689
But you're safe.
You guys are safe.

01:16:11.767 --> 01:16:13.394
Now just stay put.

01:16:13.468 --> 01:16:15.732
Nobody has to go out
there and be a hero.

01:16:15.804 --> 01:16:17.396
You got that right.

01:16:17.472 --> 01:16:21.033
- You guys aren't going out there?
- You're the sheriff. Why don't you go?

01:16:21.109 --> 01:16:24.510
Like, sheriff
of a town of 500 people.

01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:27.572
I got my qualification
from a course on the Internet.

01:16:27.649 --> 01:16:30.243
<i>For arms training,
they just told us to play Doom.</i>

01:16:30.319 --> 01:16:32.253
I say we just wait it out,

01:16:32.321 --> 01:16:34.414
they'll lose interest,
and they'll go.

01:16:34.489 --> 01:16:36.650
Yeah, I agree.
Wait it out.

01:16:37.993 --> 01:16:41.129
Hey. Where's Dudley?

01:16:48.437 --> 01:16:50.405
Oh, Dudley. Don't do that.

01:16:55.243 --> 01:16:56.938
All right, you Del Fuegos...

01:17:03.885 --> 01:17:04.874
Hey!

01:17:08.423 --> 01:17:09.822
Let's end this.

01:17:09.891 --> 01:17:12.883
At least one of you
came out to face the music.

01:17:12.961 --> 01:17:14.792
Very brave.

01:17:14.863 --> 01:17:16.125
But stupid.

01:17:16.198 --> 01:17:18.530
I didn't come to face any music.

01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:21.728
I came here to stop you fellas
from hurting this diner,

01:17:21.803 --> 01:17:24.931
which the love of my life
just happens to own.

01:17:25.974 --> 01:17:30.502
So, if it's gotta get ugly...
I'll give you ugly.

01:17:38.153 --> 01:17:40.212
It slipped out of my glove.

01:17:40.288 --> 01:17:43.382
Hey! Is it OK if I
tell people you guys did that?

01:17:43.458 --> 01:17:45.221
I should be getting back.
It's late.

01:17:45.293 --> 01:17:48.228
The guys are gonna be worrying.
We'll talk later.

01:17:49.398 --> 01:17:51.298
Guys! Guys!

01:17:51.366 --> 01:17:53.766
No, no. You don't get to
hide out here with us.

01:17:53.835 --> 01:17:57.327
You get to hide outside with those
crazy people that wanna kill us.

01:17:57.406 --> 01:18:00.239
- They got Dudley. Look out the window.
- What?

01:18:00.308 --> 01:18:03.436
All right, this is
what's gonna happen, Wild Hogs!

01:18:03.512 --> 01:18:07.915
You're gonna pay
a disobedience fee of $10,000!

01:18:07.983 --> 01:18:11.441
Plus another $40,000
to rebuild the bar!

01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:14.114
And if you wanna
see your friend alive again,

01:18:14.189 --> 01:18:16.180
do not call the cops!

01:18:16.258 --> 01:18:18.954
If you're not here
in a half an hour to settle this,

01:18:19.027 --> 01:18:22.121
I'm gonna take the fine out
on your friend's legs!

01:18:22.197 --> 01:18:24.825
I'm gonna break 'em
with this tire iron!

01:18:24.900 --> 01:18:27.027
Don't bring the money!

01:18:27.102 --> 01:18:30.560
I'm a computer programmer!
I don't need my legs!

01:18:30.639 --> 01:18:33.904
Fine! I'll break his hands!

01:18:33.975 --> 01:18:35.499
- Yeah!
- Oh, damn it.

01:18:35.577 --> 01:18:37.010
Bring the money!

01:18:37.079 --> 01:18:39.741
Definitely!
Definitely bring money!

01:18:39.815 --> 01:18:43.080
- Get him out of here!
- Now! We need money!

01:18:45.554 --> 01:18:48.751
Dudley went to save the diner,
now they're gonna break his hands.

01:18:48.824 --> 01:18:51.759
No, they're not. We're gonna...
We're gonna get him back.

01:18:51.827 --> 01:18:54.819
I've called the highway patrol.
Gonna be here in two hours.

01:18:54.896 --> 01:18:58.923
Hey, man. They said no cops, or else
they gonna take it out on Dudley.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.992
We don't wanna piss 'em off
until we get him out of their hands.

01:19:02.070 --> 01:19:04.504
You know, he's not exactly
in their hands now, OK?

01:19:04.573 --> 01:19:06.234
Why not?
He was sitting right...

01:19:06.308 --> 01:19:09.641
- What the...?
- Get me down!

01:19:09.911 --> 01:19:13.005
Why? You look good up there!

01:19:13.081 --> 01:19:15.345
You look like
a piÃ±ata with red hair!

01:19:16.485 --> 01:19:20.012
I think... I think I'm gonna keep you
up there till your buddies come!

01:19:20.088 --> 01:19:22.579
And then if they don't,
I'm gonna bust you open

01:19:22.657 --> 01:19:25.558
and we're gonna see
what falls out! Ha!

01:19:26.695 --> 01:19:29.095
Bobby! Woody! Doug!

01:19:29.164 --> 01:19:31.155
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

01:19:31.233 --> 01:19:33.793
Well, I know what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna go get him.

01:19:33.869 --> 01:19:36.269
There you go
talking crazy again.

01:19:36.338 --> 01:19:39.034
- They will kill you.
- No, I'm not talking crazy.

01:19:39.107 --> 01:19:42.304
I have three people left
in my life that I care about,

01:19:42.377 --> 01:19:44.504
and I let you guys down.

01:19:44.579 --> 01:19:46.979
Nah. I'd rather go out there
and make it go right

01:19:47.048 --> 01:19:50.506
and die doing it than be the asshole
that screwed everything up.

01:19:50.585 --> 01:19:52.815
Hey, hey, Woody.
Woody, where you going?

01:19:59.795 --> 01:20:01.023
Woody!

01:20:02.964 --> 01:20:05.091
Don't you know hogs
run in packs, baby?

01:20:08.436 --> 01:20:10.131
We're still Wild Hogs?

01:20:10.205 --> 01:20:13.003
- Wild Hogs, man.
- Wild Hogs.

01:20:13.074 --> 01:20:16.407
All right, here's how it's gotta go.
I gotta get up to 30 miles an hour.

01:20:16.478 --> 01:20:20.073
It's only duct tape holding that rope.
I'll get him by the trunk and grab him

01:20:20.148 --> 01:20:23.140
- and I'll save Dudley.
- You'll need a distraction.

01:20:23.218 --> 01:20:26.847
Together, guys. Together we can do this.
And I'm ready. I'm ready.

01:20:26.922 --> 01:20:28.321
I'm ready.

01:20:28.390 --> 01:20:30.654
- What?
- What's wrong?

01:20:30.725 --> 01:20:32.852
- It's gonna sound kind of stupid.
- What?

01:20:32.928 --> 01:20:35.556
Well, before I go,
I need one of you to yell,

01:20:35.630 --> 01:20:38.463
"It's the Golden Knight!"
It helps me get in the mood.

01:20:38.533 --> 01:20:40.296
Yeah, baby!

01:20:40.368 --> 01:20:42.359
- It helps motivate me.
- He's back!

01:20:43.805 --> 01:20:46.365
It's the Golden Knight.

01:20:46.441 --> 01:20:48.432
With gusto, though.

01:20:56.418 --> 01:20:58.716
- Now?
- Now!

01:20:58.787 --> 01:21:01.255
Holy crap,
it's the Golden Knight!

01:21:10.365 --> 01:21:12.993
Clear 'em out, boys!
Clear 'em out!

01:21:13.068 --> 01:21:16.037
Del Fuego!
Come out and play, baby!

01:21:16.104 --> 01:21:18.732
All day, baby! All day!

01:21:18.807 --> 01:21:21.071
Thirty-five, 35, exactly 35!

01:21:23.545 --> 01:21:26.378
Wild Hogs, baby! Wild Hogs!

01:21:28.216 --> 01:21:30.241
OK, guys, slow down...
You're gonna...

01:21:31.820 --> 01:21:33.583
Oh, no, no, no...
Ooh... Whoa!

01:21:33.655 --> 01:21:37.022
Du-Dud-Dudley!

01:21:37.092 --> 01:21:40.459
- Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho...
- All right, I gotcha. I gotcha.

01:21:41.496 --> 01:21:44.863
- You having fun?
- That was amazing!

01:21:44.933 --> 01:21:47.128
The tape was supposed to break!

01:21:47.202 --> 01:21:48.191
Oh...

01:21:50.372 --> 01:21:52.272
- Oh...
- There it goes.

01:21:52.340 --> 01:21:53.808
- Is there a problem?
- Come on. Come on!

01:21:53.808 --> 01:21:55.173
- Is there a problem?
- Come on. Come on!

01:21:55.243 --> 01:21:57.404
You burned down Damien's bar,

01:21:57.479 --> 01:21:59.743
you pull this little
circus act out here,

01:21:59.814 --> 01:22:03.079
now you're gonna see what
it's like when you mess with us.

01:22:03.151 --> 01:22:05.278
- That's right.
- Burn down the diner!

01:22:05.353 --> 01:22:07.218
- Torch it!
- Whoa, whoa, look, look...

01:22:07.289 --> 01:22:08.916
We can come up
with the money,

01:22:08.990 --> 01:22:10.514
I got a little bit
in my savings.

01:22:10.592 --> 01:22:13.493
It was my fault. I did it.
I cut the fuel lines.

01:22:13.561 --> 01:22:15.859
Let me deal with it.
Let these guys go.

01:22:15.931 --> 01:22:19.264
No! We're not gonna pay any money
and we're not calling the cops.

01:22:20.802 --> 01:22:22.702
We're gonna stand here and fight.

01:22:25.674 --> 01:22:27.141
You don't want our money.

01:22:27.208 --> 01:22:29.142
What do you need money for?
You're free.

01:22:29.210 --> 01:22:32.873
You're just here to get what you get
from the townspeople all the time, fear.

01:22:32.948 --> 01:22:36.076
'Cause you're scary people.
People'll do anything to stay safe,

01:22:36.151 --> 01:22:39.177
including give up the biggest
part of their lives, adventure.

01:22:39.254 --> 01:22:42.712
Let's have a little adventure, huh?
Let's fight. Let's dance, huh?

01:22:42.791 --> 01:22:44.884
- Let's do it!
- Enough's enough.

01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:48.020
- Let's kick some Del Taco ass.
- Wait, wait, wait.

01:22:48.096 --> 01:22:50.360
Do either of you guys
have a knife or scissors?

01:22:50.432 --> 01:22:51.592
A nail clipper?

01:22:51.666 --> 01:22:53.600
All right,
so how do we do this?

01:22:53.668 --> 01:22:55.659
Like high school?
A little circle, huh?

01:22:55.737 --> 01:22:57.227
- Oh!
- Yeah!

01:22:57.305 --> 01:22:59.899
Murdock, Red, Tiny.
Four on four.

01:23:01.509 --> 01:23:03.909
- Body or face, pretty boy?
- Not the face.

01:23:04.379 --> 01:23:07.007
Ow!

01:23:18.193 --> 01:23:20.661
- I'll take him.
- Thank you!

01:23:21.863 --> 01:23:23.990
Yah!

01:23:31.806 --> 01:23:34.138
- Trade back! Trade back.
- I got him, I got him.

01:23:34.209 --> 01:23:36.677
It's not really fair,
you know. I'm kinda tied up.

01:23:39.614 --> 01:23:42.777
You ever see a hook off the jab?
Huh? Bring it!

01:23:49.958 --> 01:23:52.290
- Oh!
- Let's have a little fun, baby.

01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:53.384
Whew. Let's play.

01:23:54.362 --> 01:23:55.829
Golden Glove, baby.

01:24:00.568 --> 01:24:02.627
Ow! Ow! You hit my helmet.

01:24:02.704 --> 01:24:04.535
Are you OK, man?
You hurt your hand?

01:24:04.606 --> 01:24:06.073
That actually really hurt.

01:24:06.141 --> 01:24:08.006
Whoa!

01:24:11.613 --> 01:24:13.740
Good shot! Get off!

01:24:13.815 --> 01:24:15.077
Oh!

01:24:15.150 --> 01:24:17.516
Uh-oh, no, no, no, no, don't...

01:24:18.620 --> 01:24:19.780
- Throw sand!
- What?

01:24:19.854 --> 01:24:21.685
- Throw sand!
- Yeah...

01:24:23.124 --> 01:24:24.853
I didn't mean to aim there...

01:24:26.628 --> 01:24:28.562
Ha! Whoo! Nice...

01:24:35.370 --> 01:24:38.203
Damn!
I done knocked out my boy!

01:24:38.273 --> 01:24:42.004
- Come on. You all right?
- Ooh...

01:24:49.284 --> 01:24:50.979
Well, that was easy.

01:24:53.721 --> 01:24:55.814
- Come on.
- Burn down the diner!

01:24:55.890 --> 01:24:59.382
- Yeah!
- Come on!

01:24:59.461 --> 01:25:02.521
- Oh, good. You want some more?
- Yeah, I got nothing to lose.

01:25:02.597 --> 01:25:05.725
I got no wife.
No job. No house.

01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:09.201
I got my friends, though.
I got them till the end.

01:25:09.971 --> 01:25:12.166
- Oh!
- That's great!

01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:15.209
You know, you know
what's so stupid about this?

01:25:15.276 --> 01:25:19.736
We wanted to be like you guys. What I
see here is just a bunch of grown men

01:25:19.814 --> 01:25:24.080
whose biggest decision in life is,
"Uh, sleeveless or, uh... sleeveless?

01:25:24.152 --> 01:25:26.882
Do I shit behind the rock,
or over there by that bush?"

01:25:27.489 --> 01:25:29.616
Grown men.
This is pathetic.

01:25:29.691 --> 01:25:31.283
You go ahead
and kick our ass, OK?

01:25:31.359 --> 01:25:33.987
Because we're not the posers.
You guys are the posers.

01:25:34.629 --> 01:25:36.961
Ow!

01:25:37.031 --> 01:25:40.967
Hey! Do yourselves a favor
and stay down!

01:25:41.035 --> 01:25:43.799
Twenty-five years
of being yelled at.

01:25:43.872 --> 01:25:45.430
Man, I ain't taking this...

01:25:48.676 --> 01:25:52.112
And I got a girlfriend.
Punch that out of me, bitches.

01:25:53.314 --> 01:25:54.872
Hmm?

01:26:00.355 --> 01:26:02.118
- Oh.
- Are we doing this?

01:26:06.227 --> 01:26:07.990
- Let's do it.
- Yeah.

01:26:08.062 --> 01:26:10.121
Come on.

01:26:14.769 --> 01:26:17.829
- Come on.
- Come on.

01:26:25.647 --> 01:26:27.012
You're kidding me, right?

01:26:31.486 --> 01:26:33.010
What's wrong with you guys?

01:26:34.923 --> 01:26:37.187
All right!
You wanna keep going?

01:26:37.258 --> 01:26:39.783
I don't think so.

01:26:39.861 --> 01:26:44.730
You're done, Jack.
You Del Fuegos! You are done!

01:26:44.799 --> 01:26:47.063
And we want you
out of our town, now.

01:26:47.135 --> 01:26:49.797
- And who's "we"?
- All of us.

01:26:53.608 --> 01:26:56.577
If four people could
stand up to a gang of bikers,

01:26:56.644 --> 01:26:58.509
I guess we can too!

01:26:58.580 --> 01:27:01.344
Well, we'll fight you and
the Children of the Corn too.

01:27:01.416 --> 01:27:05.910
'Cause the Del Fuegos don't
back down! This is our highway.

01:27:05.987 --> 01:27:08.581
And we're gonna
defend our highway.

01:27:08.656 --> 01:27:10.453
Wrong, Jack.

01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:14.651
It's my highway.

01:27:14.729 --> 01:27:16.026
Blade.

01:27:17.031 --> 01:27:18.965
Hi, Maggie.

01:27:20.768 --> 01:27:24.898
- Hmm. Bar burned down.
- Yeah.

01:27:24.973 --> 01:27:27.840
These posers, these
four posers right here.

01:27:27.909 --> 01:27:31.845
Four guys
stand off 50 bikers...

01:27:33.248 --> 01:27:35.409
...and they're the posers?
- Yeah.

01:27:35.483 --> 01:27:37.417
They burnt down
the bar that you built.

01:27:37.485 --> 01:27:38.782
It was a shithole.

01:27:38.853 --> 01:27:41.321
I insured it for
twice what it was worth.

01:27:41.389 --> 01:27:42.879
The guys did me a favor.

01:27:42.957 --> 01:27:45.721
We were just following
the code that you wrote.

01:27:45.793 --> 01:27:48.091
Why do you think
I don't wear the colors, Jack?

01:27:48.162 --> 01:27:49.789
Why do you think I ride alone?

01:27:49.864 --> 01:27:51.923
'Cause you don't
know about it anymore.

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:55.731
I think you all oughta get back on your
bikes and go out and ride the highway

01:27:55.803 --> 01:27:58.067
until you remember
what riding's all about.

01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:00.969
Let it go, Jack.

01:28:13.788 --> 01:28:15.278
OK, Pop.

01:28:17.125 --> 01:28:19.252
Takes after his mom.

01:28:29.637 --> 01:28:32.003
Man, that was like
level 12 of Doom.

01:28:33.808 --> 01:28:35.469
The posers.

01:28:35.543 --> 01:28:37.875
- What do you guys call yourselves?
- I'm Woody.

01:28:37.945 --> 01:28:39.071
- I'm Bobby.
- I'm Doug.

01:28:39.147 --> 01:28:41.081
No, no, no. You all riding together?

01:28:41.149 --> 01:28:43.447
- What do you...
- Hogs! Wild Hogs.

01:28:43.518 --> 01:28:45.543
Wild...
Yeah, Wild Hogs.

01:28:46.788 --> 01:28:50.690
Well, Wild Hogs,
ride hard or stay home.

01:28:50.758 --> 01:28:54.524
- Yeah.
- Oh, and, guys, lose the watches.

01:28:57.699 --> 01:28:59.360
- Freedom, baby.
- We did it, babe.

01:28:59.434 --> 01:29:02.528
All day. All day.

01:29:02.603 --> 01:29:06.095
Hey! Hey! We're Wild Hogs!
The saga continues!

01:29:21.556 --> 01:29:22.818
What the hell?

01:29:22.890 --> 01:29:25.916
What in the world
is going on around here?

01:29:27.095 --> 01:29:29.290
Plumbing conference?

01:29:29.364 --> 01:29:30.763
Have you lost your mind?

01:29:30.832 --> 01:29:32.231
Shut up, Doug!

01:29:32.300 --> 01:29:35.030
Bobby, who are these people,
and where are we at?

01:29:35.103 --> 01:29:39.233
Well, obviously, I'm not at a...
plumbing conference in Cleveland, baby.

01:29:39.307 --> 01:29:40.331
Oh, really?

01:29:40.408 --> 01:29:42.433
Baby, I've been
fighting bikers all day,

01:29:42.510 --> 01:29:44.671
this little Chinese
dude bust my nose,

01:29:44.746 --> 01:29:46.543
I've been slapping bulls...

01:29:46.614 --> 01:29:50.072
Bobby, I don't give a damn
about you fighting no bulls!

01:29:50.151 --> 01:29:52.551
Now, I want you to get
your ass in that van

01:29:52.620 --> 01:29:53.985
because we are going home.

01:29:54.055 --> 01:29:56.216
I cannot believe you'd
deceive me like this!

01:29:56.290 --> 01:29:57.917
- Karen...
- No, Bobby, I want...!

01:29:57.992 --> 01:29:59.391
Karen!

01:30:00.261 --> 01:30:02.058
Slow your roll.

01:30:02.130 --> 01:30:05.224
Look, baby, I love you, OK?

01:30:05.299 --> 01:30:07.358
But I'm tired of being talked at.

01:30:07.435 --> 01:30:09.835
I don't talk at you, Bobby!

01:30:09.904 --> 01:30:12.099
- I talk...
- Look at what you're doing now.

01:30:12.173 --> 01:30:14.334
Come on. You feel me?

01:30:14.409 --> 01:30:16.900
OK, baby, all right,
all right, I feel you.

01:30:16.978 --> 01:30:19.173
Right now I just need
you to show me some love.

01:30:19.247 --> 01:30:21.181
Just a little bit of love.

01:30:21.883 --> 01:30:25.375
Oh... Mmm...

01:30:25.453 --> 01:30:29.082
That's scrumptious.

01:30:29.157 --> 01:30:31.148
You seriously got
in a fight with bikers?

01:30:31.225 --> 01:30:33.557
A whole bunch of 'em.
We chased 'em out of town!

01:30:33.628 --> 01:30:34.925
There was 50 of them.

01:30:34.996 --> 01:30:36.361
- It was something.
- Fifty?

01:30:36.431 --> 01:30:38.831
I gotta tell the guys
about this. That is awesome!

01:30:38.900 --> 01:30:40.527
I'll be right back, OK?

01:30:40.601 --> 01:30:42.262
Doug, are you sure you're OK?

01:30:43.638 --> 01:30:45.799
- Ow, ow, ow, ow...
- Oh, your ribs, your ribs.

01:30:45.873 --> 01:30:47.864
- You're standing on my foot!
- Oh, sorry!

01:30:47.942 --> 01:30:49.466
So I'll see you when I get back?

01:30:49.544 --> 01:30:51.205
- Mm-hmm.
- All right?

01:30:51.279 --> 01:30:54.578
- Mmm. I love you.
- I love you too, baby.

01:30:54.649 --> 01:30:56.344
All right.

01:31:02.190 --> 01:31:03.817
Get a room, baby.

01:31:03.891 --> 01:31:06.621
Can we? Do we have time?

01:31:06.694 --> 01:31:08.753
When are you
coming back through?

01:31:08.830 --> 01:31:10.161
A biker never knows.

01:31:10.231 --> 01:31:12.358
Maybe a week.

01:31:12.433 --> 01:31:14.094
Maybe a month.

01:31:14.969 --> 01:31:17.335
Six days, ten hours, 27 minutes,

01:31:17.405 --> 01:31:20.397
give or take six minutes
for wind resistance.

01:31:24.812 --> 01:31:27.645
Well, I sure do wish
you guys would stick around.

01:31:27.715 --> 01:31:30.183
We got some riding to do, sheriff.
Thanks anyway.

01:31:30.251 --> 01:31:31.741
Well, I'll just say it:

01:31:31.819 --> 01:31:33.878
You fellas were
a blessing to this place.

01:31:33.955 --> 01:31:36.014
I mean, I'm not gonna
get all emotional

01:31:36.090 --> 01:31:38.615
like old hamburger head
over here always...

01:31:40.628 --> 01:31:42.289
What did you
just call me?

01:31:42.363 --> 01:31:45.230
Uh, see, when we walked up,
you were on my...

01:31:45.299 --> 01:31:48.291
You son of a bitch!

01:31:49.103 --> 01:31:51.503
Come on, Buck, I swear.
That's the first time!

01:31:51.572 --> 01:31:54.097
- I don't wanna hear it!
- Well, honestly, you can't.

01:31:54.175 --> 01:31:55.836
I heard that.

01:31:55.910 --> 01:31:58.879
- Ready to ride, guys?
- Ready to ride, baby.

01:31:58.946 --> 01:32:01.039
Let's see what the
West Coast has to offer.

01:32:01.115 --> 01:32:03.310
Think there'll be
any trouble along the way?

01:32:03.384 --> 01:32:05.318
Oh, I hope so.

01:32:05.386 --> 01:32:07.320
Yeah, I like
the way you think.

01:32:07.388 --> 01:32:09.413
I like the way you think.

01:32:26.941 --> 01:32:29.341
I'm OK!
I just hurt my face.

01:33:22.096 --> 01:33:23.495
Wow.

01:33:25.032 --> 01:33:27.899
- Hey, we did it!
- Woo-hoo!

01:33:27.969 --> 01:33:29.561
Do you believe this?

01:33:34.208 --> 01:33:36.938
- Hello!
- Whoa, my goodness.

01:33:37.011 --> 01:33:39.309
Whoa, oh, no. Oh, no.
Oh! Whoa!

01:33:39.380 --> 01:33:41.712
Whoa! Ah!

01:33:41.782 --> 01:33:42.771
Whoa!

01:33:43.284 --> 01:33:45.844
Whoa! Sorry, sorry.

01:33:47.421 --> 01:33:49.855
Two thousand miles,
but I finally got it.

01:33:49.924 --> 01:33:52.620
'Bout time, rookie!

01:33:54.595 --> 01:33:58.156
- Lot of distractions.
- California, baby!

01:34:17.318 --> 01:34:19.752
<i>Welcome back
to Extreme Makeover: Home Edition.</i>

01:34:19.820 --> 01:34:22.118
Now, we've met
some incredible families,

01:34:22.189 --> 01:34:24.453
but this could be
the saddest story we've...

01:34:24.525 --> 01:34:25.787
We've ever seen.

01:34:25.860 --> 01:34:28.021
This family has lost everything.

01:34:28.095 --> 01:34:31.155
They've lost their home,
they've lost their history,

01:34:31.232 --> 01:34:32.859
they've lost their heritage.

01:34:32.933 --> 01:34:35.458
But this week, we've done
something about that.

01:34:35.536 --> 01:34:38.699
So let's welcome back...
the Del Fuego family!

01:34:45.012 --> 01:34:46.604
Well, Jack, two months ago, man,

01:34:46.681 --> 01:34:48.478
you lost the only home
you ever knew.

01:34:48.549 --> 01:34:51.177
But thanks to a call
from your friends, the Wild Hogs,

01:34:51.252 --> 01:34:52.514
we built you a new one.

01:34:52.586 --> 01:34:54.554
That's so great.

01:34:54.622 --> 01:34:57.682
They... He didn't have to
mention us. That's... Oh, man.

01:34:57.758 --> 01:34:59.487
<i>So you guys know what to say?</i>

01:34:59.560 --> 01:35:03.189
- Say it with me!
- Bus driver, move that bus!

01:35:07.768 --> 01:35:09.736
Oh!

01:35:10.438 --> 01:35:11.871
Wow!

01:35:18.879 --> 01:35:21.677
Usually we have some
pretty emotional reactions,

01:35:21.749 --> 01:35:24.343
but, uh, Jack, you know, wow.

01:35:24.418 --> 01:35:28.878
I'm not sure what
was going on with Jack.

01:35:28.956 --> 01:35:30.514
Oh...

01:35:30.591 --> 01:35:33.116
Thanks to our friends at Sears
and local breweries,

01:35:33.194 --> 01:35:36.891
who provided state-of-the-art taps
and a year's supply of free beer!

01:35:40.768 --> 01:35:43.669
Oh, my God! That is so cool!

01:35:43.738 --> 01:35:45.501
That is so cool!

01:35:45.573 --> 01:35:48.007
Cool as a parking lot
made out of real leather?

01:35:48.075 --> 01:35:50.339
- Oh!
- That is so rad!

01:35:50.411 --> 01:35:52.504
That is so rad!

01:35:55.983 --> 01:35:59.646
The bar was my home.
When it went down...

01:35:59.720 --> 01:36:02.883
I felt... homeless.

01:36:03.824 --> 01:36:07.351
Del Fuegos,
go check out your new home!

01:36:12.566 --> 01:36:15.433
Here's the thing, you're
talking about a bunch of guys

01:36:15.503 --> 01:36:18.563
that grew up in broken homes.
They really didn't have a home.

01:36:18.639 --> 01:36:20.800
And now they've got one.
With a bidet in it.

01:36:20.875 --> 01:36:24.470
Thank you!

01:36:28.115 --> 01:36:31.107
We love our bar.
Thanks, America!

01:36:32.019 --> 01:36:33.816
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

01:36:33.888 --> 01:36:35.753
Wild Hogs!
