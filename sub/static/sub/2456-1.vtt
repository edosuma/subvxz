DAVID: <i>There was a girl.</i>

00:46.839 --> 00:49.692
<i>A beautiful girl
surrounded by people.</i>

00:50.593 --> 00:52.427
<i>Yet utterly alone.</i>

00:52.428 --> 00:55.156
<i>Her brother, Chris,
died sophomore year.</i>

00:56.474 --> 00:58.951
<i>She spent all of her time
secluded with her family,</i>

01:00.478 --> 01:02.663
<i>or in the comfort of books.</i>

01:05.024 --> 01:06.816
<i>I watched her for
all of high school,</i>

01:06.817 --> 01:09.069
<i>waiting for that perfect
moment to talk to her,</i>

01:09.070 --> 01:11.237
<i>but that moment never came.</i>

01:11.238 --> 01:12.923
(INAUDIBLE)

01:13.949 --> 01:16.260
<i>I watched as people
gradually forgot about her.</i>

01:18.496 --> 01:20.598
<i>And she seemed content
to disappear.</i>

01:21.665 --> 01:23.267
<i>But not to me.</i>

01:23.959 --> 01:26.395
<i>And although she didn't know it,</i>

01:27.254 --> 01:29.482
<i>I saw the possibility of us.</i>

01:30.257 --> 01:32.777
Jade Butterfield. Mmm.

01:33.511 --> 01:36.012
Four years, and you
never talked to her.

01:36.013 --> 01:37.889
Well, in my defense, no one did.

01:37.890 --> 01:40.392
There is a reason for that.
She's an ice queen.

01:40.393 --> 01:42.286
Girl can't be real.

01:43.312 --> 01:45.271
You don't think she's real?

01:45.272 --> 01:46.356
"You don't think..."

01:46.357 --> 01:50.151
Girl looks like that, has that much
dough, can't be real, all right?

01:50.152 --> 01:52.004
I know these things.

01:58.035 --> 01:59.160
(CHUCKLES)

01:59.161 --> 02:00.537
Ah, it's stupid, I know.

02:00.538 --> 02:01.889
No, it's not.

02:03.499 --> 02:06.209
Come on. Dad wants a photo
of the happy family.

02:06.210 --> 02:07.711
Oh, whose family are we
taking a picture of?

02:07.712 --> 02:09.062
Come on.

02:11.340 --> 02:13.466
Jade, come take a picture.

02:13.467 --> 02:15.385
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

02:15.386 --> 02:16.529
Okay.

02:18.222 --> 02:20.390
Thank you so much.
Will you take two?

02:20.391 --> 02:22.034
Just to be safe.

02:23.060 --> 02:24.578
Okay.

02:27.106 --> 02:28.565
(SHUTTER CLICKING)

02:28.566 --> 02:30.483
- There.
- Thank you.

02:30.484 --> 02:33.069
- Congrats, honey.
- Thanks.

02:33.070 --> 02:34.237
GIRL 1: That one's going online.

02:34.238 --> 02:35.339
GIRL 2: Yeah.

02:38.409 --> 02:39.743
I barely know those girls.

02:39.744 --> 02:41.411
I didn't expect to
be in the picture.

02:41.412 --> 02:42.787
Take a seat. Come on.

02:42.788 --> 02:46.725
Mom and Dad's happy
family photo can wait.

02:46.751 --> 02:48.018
(CHUCKLES)

02:48.461 --> 02:51.897
Promise me you won't do in
college what you did here.

02:54.300 --> 02:57.844
Chris was an amazing brother,
and we all miss him,

02:57.845 --> 02:59.697
but you can't stop living.

03:01.265 --> 03:03.993
He'd want us to live
more, not less.

03:04.060 --> 03:07.771
How's anyone ever gonna know how
ridiculous and funny you are

03:07.772 --> 03:09.647
if all you ever do is hang
out with Mom and Dad?

03:09.648 --> 03:11.608
- I don't just hang out with Mom and Dad.
- Oh, really?

03:11.609 --> 03:12.817
How many kids signed this?

03:12.818 --> 03:14.527
And, uh, you can't
include teachers.

03:14.528 --> 03:15.629
Don't.

03:18.949 --> 03:20.075
Thanks, Dad.

03:20.076 --> 03:21.719
You're welcome, son.
I'm proud of you.

03:22.286 --> 03:24.788
Thank you. It means a lot.

03:24.789 --> 03:26.706
Maybe you should buy
a blowtorch, huh?

03:26.707 --> 03:28.517
- To melt the ice off your girl.
- Mace...

03:28.793 --> 03:30.460
- Your son's got a crush.
- No, I don't.

03:30.461 --> 03:32.212
- Does he?
- No, I don't.

03:32.213 --> 03:33.296
- Is she here?
- Yeah.

03:33.297 --> 03:34.339
Which one is it?

03:34.340 --> 03:36.466
- Jade Butterfield. Mmm-hmm.
- HARRY: That blonde over there?

03:36.467 --> 03:38.551
- Don't you dare. No.
- Hey, Jade!

03:38.552 --> 03:39.803
Hey, Jade!

03:39.804 --> 03:40.929
MACE: Jade!

03:40.930 --> 03:41.971
Jade, I want you to meet my son!

03:41.972 --> 03:44.074
- Come on! Come on!
- The greatest kid here!

03:44.684 --> 03:46.601
DAVID: Hey, you guys. Come on, man!

03:46.602 --> 03:49.872
Whoo-hoo. My son, the
high school graduate!

03:50.564 --> 03:52.082
(GROANING)

03:56.946 --> 03:59.030
Oh, wow. Mr. Schwartz,
thank you. This is too much.

03:59.031 --> 04:02.593
Mrs. Schwartz. You guys take
care now, all right? Okay.

04:03.327 --> 04:05.221
Ah. (CHUCKLES)

04:05.705 --> 04:07.264
Balling!

04:07.581 --> 04:09.499
Dude, you going to
Jenny's Saturday night?

04:09.500 --> 04:11.769
Really? Again?

04:12.628 --> 04:14.462
- Come on.
- Don't do this.

04:14.463 --> 04:17.007
Do you have any idea how your
constant break-ups affect my life?

04:17.007 --> 04:18.091
I'm so sorry.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.801
The energy, man, it gets all
awkward and shit, all right?

04:19.802 --> 04:21.594
Just get back together
with her so I can

04:21.595 --> 04:23.304
go back to the life
I'm accustomed to.

04:23.305 --> 04:25.658
Can you act like a
respectable human being?

04:26.434 --> 04:28.018
You're the first
face the guests see.

04:28.019 --> 04:29.912
And yet they keep coming back.
(CHUCKLES)

04:31.063 --> 04:32.355
Welcome to the Inn.
How are you doing?

04:32.356 --> 04:35.775
HUGH: Can you just, uh,
give me a nice spot?

04:35.776 --> 04:38.587
MACE: Absolutely.
Will do, sir. Take care.

04:39.321 --> 04:40.422
(CHUCKLES)

04:42.408 --> 04:43.616
You're Jade Butterfield.

04:43.617 --> 04:44.802
(CHUCKLES)

04:44.952 --> 04:46.911
We go to school... I mean,

04:46.912 --> 04:48.788
we went to school together.

04:48.789 --> 04:50.057
David, right?

04:51.208 --> 04:52.393
Yeah.

04:54.170 --> 04:55.521
HUGH: Hey, Jade.

04:59.216 --> 05:00.317
I should go.

05:01.135 --> 05:02.611
Okay.

05:11.687 --> 05:12.788
Would you sign this?

05:15.274 --> 05:16.375
Sure.

05:38.381 --> 05:39.690
MACE: <i>Jade Butterfield</i>

05:39.840 --> 05:41.734
<i>Come back to me</i>

05:42.802 --> 05:44.844
<i>I'm David and I love you</i>

05:44.845 --> 05:46.071
(CHUCKLES)

05:46.222 --> 05:49.700
HUGH: My wife will have a mixed salad
to start and your pasta special.

05:50.476 --> 05:53.829
My daughter's gonna have the
steak, medium, and soup to start.

05:54.188 --> 05:55.289
Good?

05:56.273 --> 05:57.583
- Yeah.
- WAITER: And for you?

05:58.526 --> 06:00.336
I think I can handle this myself.

06:00.528 --> 06:03.697
I'm gonna go for the burger and
fries. Medium rare, please.

06:03.698 --> 06:05.758
And a Crown and Coke. Better
make it a double, actually.

06:05.783 --> 06:07.867
You're here from ASU
for two short months.

06:07.868 --> 06:10.471
Let's just try and
keep it pleasant.

06:10.621 --> 06:12.598
That's why I got the double, Dad.

06:16.335 --> 06:17.645
Um...

06:19.130 --> 06:23.383
We've been going back and forth over
what to get you for graduation.

06:23.384 --> 06:27.470
We know we haven't done very
well with the holidays and so on

06:27.471 --> 06:29.472
and that's not been
fair to you or Keith.

06:29.473 --> 06:30.974
I don't need anything.

06:30.975 --> 06:33.810
We could go shopping. We could
get a new wardrobe for Brown.

06:33.811 --> 06:34.894
Yeah, you should
think of something,

06:34.895 --> 06:36.146
or else you'll end up
with a photo of this guy.

06:36.147 --> 06:37.414
(ALL CHUCKLE)

06:44.196 --> 06:45.280
There is one thing.

06:45.281 --> 06:46.924
What? Anything.

06:50.619 --> 06:52.429
- A party.
- A party? Wow.

06:54.415 --> 06:56.333
Out of all the things
you could ask for?

06:56.334 --> 06:59.836
Well, I was looking at all
the kids at school today

06:59.837 --> 07:02.797
and high school's where you're supposed
to make friends you'll keep forever.

07:02.798 --> 07:04.674
I don't know any of them.

07:04.675 --> 07:05.759
They don't know me.

07:05.760 --> 07:09.721
A party. I think that
that is a great idea.

07:09.722 --> 07:11.031
Well...

07:11.891 --> 07:13.117
Sure.

07:14.226 --> 07:16.186
- Yeah, sure. Okay.
- (ALL CHUCKLE)

07:16.187 --> 07:18.646
HUGH: It's been a long time since
we've celebrated anything.

07:18.647 --> 07:21.041
Thank you very much, Mr. Abbey.

07:25.696 --> 07:26.797
(CHUCKLES)

07:29.700 --> 07:31.034
- Hi.
- Hi.

07:31.035 --> 07:32.202
Do you want me to get your car?

07:32.203 --> 07:33.637
No. Um...

07:33.954 --> 07:35.764
I'm having a graduation party.

07:35.873 --> 07:36.956
(CHUCKLES)

07:36.957 --> 07:39.167
- I'm inviting the entire class.
- Really?

07:39.168 --> 07:40.561
Is it that hard to believe?

07:40.795 --> 07:43.546
Uh, no. I've just
never seen you out.

07:43.547 --> 07:44.714
I didn't know that you, uh...

07:44.715 --> 07:46.484
- Mingled with the masses.
- (CHUCKLES)

07:47.510 --> 07:49.678
I just spent the last
four years of high school

07:49.679 --> 07:51.699
trying to get into another
four years of college.

07:51.889 --> 07:53.014
(CHUCKLING)

07:53.015 --> 07:54.909
- You don't have to come.
- No, I want to.

07:55.893 --> 07:57.727
(STAMMERING) I mean, we want to.

07:57.728 --> 07:59.437
- We wanna come.
- We wanna come.

(ENGINE REVVING)

08:00.898 --> 08:02.541
Could you just give me one second?

08:03.234 --> 08:04.859
- MACE: Welcome.
- Welcome to the Inn.

08:04.860 --> 08:06.069
Keep it close. Don't park me in.

08:06.070 --> 08:07.671
- Oh, sure, no...
- (COINS CLATTER)

08:09.156 --> 08:11.241
No, he didn't. Hey, man.

08:11.242 --> 08:13.201
Now, I'll take them, but you gotta
hand them to me, all right?

08:13.202 --> 08:14.577
I don't pick up shit off the floor.

08:14.578 --> 08:16.347
It's time to learn.

08:18.207 --> 08:19.809
- Hey. Hey. Hey.

08:20.751 --> 08:22.585
You boys best earn your
three minutes in my car.

08:22.586 --> 08:24.254
- Yeah, thanks, man.
- MACE: "Boys"?

08:24.255 --> 08:25.676
DAVID: Give me the keys. Come on.

08:26.340 --> 08:28.067
Give me the keys.

08:35.099 --> 08:38.535
I guess we should definitely earn
our three minutes, don't you think?

08:42.273 --> 08:43.374
Why limit ourselves to three?

08:43.399 --> 08:44.917
I mean, why?

08:44.942 --> 08:46.568
- Are you coming?
- You're stealing his car?

08:46.569 --> 08:49.237
- Whoa.
- I mean, I wouldn't say "stealing."

08:49.238 --> 08:50.613
Technically, borrowing.

08:50.614 --> 08:52.073
What about your job?

08:52.074 --> 08:54.034
Jade, get in the car.

Sorry. We just wanted to make
sure it wasn't parked in.

10:02.603 --> 10:04.979
You ate Fatburger in my Maserati.

10:04.980 --> 10:07.023
It's over. You're done, mister.

10:07.024 --> 10:09.293
That's actually my fault.
You should blame me.

10:09.527 --> 10:10.735
All right, I want him fired.

10:10.736 --> 10:12.195
- Now.
- No, it was my...

- I want him fired, too.
- It was my fault!

It was me. It was me. I ate it.

Everyone, cool down.

Why don't we go inside?

It's gonna take a lot
more than stealing

my car to get her
to spread her legs.

10:35.845 --> 10:38.054
MACE: Oh, shit. Damn!

25:00.251 --> 25:02.645
Well, let's just say I
prefer how it started.

You know, I really respect
your daughter, sir.

wanted to make her happy.

that you always put first.

01:05:03.904 --> 01:05:07.716
I know, but it's because of David
that I'm not in jail, too.

01:05:07.783 --> 01:05:09.593
No, it's because of David
that you've changed.

01:05:09.618 --> 01:05:10.827
And not for the better.

01:05:10.828 --> 01:05:12.763
Hugh, are you not
gonna go and get him?

01:05:13.497 --> 01:05:16.392
I've learned a few
things about David.

01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:23.107
It's not gonna be his
first night in jail.

01:05:29.472 --> 01:05:31.492
We never really knew him
or what he's capable of.

01:05:31.515 --> 01:05:33.576
You've been digging into his past?

01:05:33.601 --> 01:05:36.301
Oh, rightfully so. He didn't think
to share this with you, did he?

01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:38.646
I'm sure there's a perfectly
good explanation.

01:05:38.647 --> 01:05:39.856
Well, yeah, he's a criminal.

01:05:39.857 --> 01:05:42.192
And that's why he's
behind bars as we speak.

01:05:42.193 --> 01:05:43.985
This could cost him his
college, his future.

01:05:43.986 --> 01:05:45.963
He doesn't have a future, Jade.

01:05:45.988 --> 01:05:48.591
And he's gonna make sure that
you don't have one either.

01:05:50.826 --> 01:05:52.911
This is the kind of guy you
really want to fight for?

01:05:52.912 --> 01:05:55.473
Yes! I don't care about his past.

01:05:55.539 --> 01:05:58.375
There's nothing you can say that will
change the way I feel about him.

01:05:58.376 --> 01:06:00.460
- Mom, please!
- Look, this is ridiculous!

01:06:00.461 --> 01:06:02.587
I'm calling the station. Stop it.

01:06:02.588 --> 01:06:03.939
Anne.

01:06:04.340 --> 01:06:05.900
Please, Dad.

01:06:06.509 --> 01:06:08.551
Get him out.

01:06:08.552 --> 01:06:10.196
I love him.

01:06:17.687 --> 01:06:19.163
On one condition.

01:06:22.858 --> 01:06:24.168

01:06:33.452 --> 01:06:37.664
As happy as I am to see you, I was
hoping it wasn't gonna be you.

01:06:37.665 --> 01:06:38.766
Ah.

01:06:39.709 --> 01:06:41.084
I'm sorry. Uh...

01:06:41.085 --> 01:06:42.210
I'll pay you back. I promise.

01:06:42.211 --> 01:06:44.396
I'm not concerned about the money.

01:06:45.589 --> 01:06:46.732
Where's Jade?

01:06:46.757 --> 01:06:47.900
She's at home.

01:06:49.051 --> 01:06:51.779
She just knew it would make
things harder if she came.

01:06:51.971 --> 01:06:54.406
I'm taking you to your car, David.

01:06:55.599 --> 01:06:57.600
You're not coming back to
the lake house with us.

01:06:57.601 --> 01:06:58.935
Hey, hang on. What do you mean?

01:06:58.936 --> 01:07:01.747
Your relationship with
my daughter is over.

01:07:02.273 --> 01:07:05.042
It's time to let her go. Let her
have the success she deserves.

01:07:05.276 --> 01:07:07.256
Is that what she wants or
is that what you want?

01:07:09.613 --> 01:07:12.341
She is not here to
pick you up, is she?

01:07:12.658 --> 01:07:14.051
I'll ask her myself.

01:07:14.952 --> 01:07:17.221
She's taking the internship.

01:07:18.789 --> 01:07:20.724
Yeah, she decided this morning.

01:07:21.834 --> 01:07:23.394
This is just a summer fling.

01:07:23.461 --> 01:07:25.104
It's not real love.

01:07:25.171 --> 01:07:26.272
(SCOFFS)

01:07:26.297 --> 01:07:29.233
You're in no position to lecture
me on what real love is.

01:07:29.425 --> 01:07:31.735
You have no idea what
goes on in my marriage.

01:07:31.802 --> 01:07:32.945
No.

01:07:33.971 --> 01:07:35.096
No, I don't.

01:07:35.097 --> 01:07:37.867
But I know you have
this incredible family.

01:07:37.933 --> 01:07:40.852
I see how you treat them. I would
never treat Jade that way.

01:07:40.853 --> 01:07:42.246
Oh. Oh.

01:07:42.688 --> 01:07:44.540
Tell me, how would you
treat her, David?

01:07:44.607 --> 01:07:46.625
Go ahead, tell me.

01:07:46.984 --> 01:07:48.711
Like that kid in the police report?

01:07:48.778 --> 01:07:50.212
I did a little research.

01:07:50.279 --> 01:07:52.256
Is that the kind of person you
think I want for my daughter?

01:07:52.323 --> 01:07:54.717
That was a long time ago.
That's not me.

01:07:56.744 --> 01:08:00.455
I would've thought you would have
learned more from your past.

01:08:00.456 --> 01:08:02.683
I'm sure your father must have.

01:08:04.502 --> 01:08:05.669
Don't you talk about my dad.

01:08:05.670 --> 01:08:07.837
No, I mean, everything I hear,
he sounds like a great guy.

01:08:07.838 --> 01:08:12.026
Works hard, puts a roof over
your head, does the best he can.

01:08:12.843 --> 01:08:15.224
It was never quite enough for
your mother, though, was it?

01:08:15.805 --> 01:08:17.113
You have nothing.

01:08:17.555 --> 01:08:19.307
You don't know what
you're talking about.

01:08:19.308 --> 01:08:22.578
One day you get home early from
school, there's another man there.

01:08:22.978 --> 01:08:24.705
And what do you do, David?

01:08:25.189 --> 01:08:26.791
You beat him.

01:08:26.857 --> 01:08:30.026
You beat him so badly he has to
be taken away in an ambulance.

01:08:30.027 --> 01:08:33.964
So he goes to the hospital, you go
to juvie, and your mom takes off.

01:08:34.490 --> 01:08:37.533
You know that love that you
talked about at dinner?

01:08:37.535 --> 01:08:39.515
You're never gonna have that.
It doesn't exist.

01:08:39.537 --> 01:08:42.872
Your story isn't gonna end any
differently than your parents' did.

01:08:42.872 --> 01:08:46.018
Jade will get bored with you.

01:08:46.377 --> 01:08:48.086
Just like your mom got bored.

01:08:48.087 --> 01:08:49.712
And how are you going
to handle yourself when

01:08:49.714 --> 01:08:52.233
that happens again, David? Huh?

01:08:52.550 --> 01:08:53.966
Because it will.

01:08:53.968 --> 01:08:55.719
It doesn't matter how hard you try.

01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:58.220
You're not gonna be
able to hang on to her.

01:08:58.221 --> 01:09:00.390
She is gonna get to Brown.

01:09:00.390 --> 01:09:04.828
She is gonna meet somebody like
her, smart, with a future,

01:09:05.270 --> 01:09:07.247
and she's gonna leave.

01:09:07.356 --> 01:09:09.375
And she won't look back.

01:09:09.442 --> 01:09:10.835
You know why?

01:09:14.904 --> 01:09:16.740
Because you're not good enough.

01:09:16.741 --> 01:09:18.843
You're just like your father.

What happened?

01:10:16.133 --> 01:10:17.801
What do you think? David lost it.

01:10:17.802 --> 01:10:19.302
I tried to fend him off, and he...

01:10:19.303 --> 01:10:20.845
I don't believe you.

01:10:20.846 --> 01:10:22.239
Look at me.

01:10:23.265 --> 01:10:24.599
He completely lost control.

01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:25.684
I told him you were leaving...

01:10:25.685 --> 01:10:27.477
You told him?
Why would you tell him that?

01:10:27.478 --> 01:10:29.455
Because you wouldn't have.

01:10:29.647 --> 01:10:31.415
And it's time he knows the truth.

01:10:32.358 --> 01:10:34.084
Jade, what...

01:10:35.361 --> 01:10:36.921
No.

01:10:37.655 --> 01:10:40.824
He peppers him with a right,
he peppers him with a left.

01:10:40.825 --> 01:10:43.034
He's got Hugh Butterfield
in the corner.

us there last night.

and you know it.

shit like that all the time.

have anything to lose.

to Brown now, too?

you had just told me.

01:15:32.241 --> 01:15:33.616
HARRY: <i>Is she gonna be all right?</i>

01:15:33.617 --> 01:15:36.595
She's got a broken wrist,
among other things.

01:15:37.455 --> 01:15:39.306
Thank God it wasn't worse.

01:15:39.999 --> 01:15:41.267
Look. Uh...

01:15:42.501 --> 01:15:45.146
We'd appreciate it if you
would show this to David.

01:15:47.006 --> 01:15:49.507
And once we've seen
a judge on Monday,

01:15:49.508 --> 01:15:50.842
he's a close personal
friend of family,

01:15:50.843 --> 01:15:52.135
it will no longer be temporary.

01:15:52.136 --> 01:15:53.571
Now, wait a minute.

01:15:55.181 --> 01:15:58.141
I know how you must feel,
but they're just kids.

01:15:58.142 --> 01:16:00.602
David, he's only 18. He's got
his whole life ahead of him.

01:16:00.603 --> 01:16:01.936
My daughter made a
choice to move on.

01:16:01.937 --> 01:16:04.189
He didn't respect that and
he knew the conditions.

01:16:04.190 --> 01:16:06.625
That he couldn't get in a
fight with his girlfriend?

01:16:06.650 --> 01:16:08.794
That he couldn't sneak into a zoo?

01:16:08.861 --> 01:16:11.321
David's not a criminal, he's
just a kid with shit luck.

01:16:11.322 --> 01:16:12.947
That doesn't warrant
a restraining order.

01:16:12.948 --> 01:16:15.158
Your son hit me in the face!

01:16:15.159 --> 01:16:17.369
And if you think I'm gonna let my
daughter get anywhere near him,

01:16:17.370 --> 01:16:18.578
you're out of your mind.

01:16:18.579 --> 01:16:20.431
She could've died
out on that street.

01:16:21.165 --> 01:16:22.999
He can behave like
a reckless idiot,

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:24.250
he can screw up his
future all he wants...

01:16:24.251 --> 01:16:26.169
You say one more unkind
word about my son

01:16:26.170 --> 01:16:27.379

can't say another.

50! 50 feet!

01:16:28.631 --> 01:16:31.049
If he comes within 50 feet of
her, he's gonna be arrested,

01:16:31.050 --> 01:16:33.861
and I'll sue you for everything
you've got. I've lost a child.

01:16:36.347 --> 01:16:37.514
I'm not losing another.

01:16:37.515 --> 01:16:39.116

01:16:39.642 --> 01:16:41.410

01:17:07.211 --> 01:17:08.854
You shouldn't be here, Jade.

01:17:08.879 --> 01:17:11.506
I know, but I just
wanted to say goodbye

01:17:11.507 --> 01:17:12.942
and his cell phone isn't working.

01:17:12.967 --> 01:17:14.819
That's 'cause I took
it away from him.

01:17:15.594 --> 01:17:17.554
Last thing I need is a
cop showing up here

01:17:17.555 --> 01:17:19.681
'cause your daddy sees our
number on the phone bill.

01:17:19.682 --> 01:17:21.408
Now, I'm sorry, honey.

01:17:22.184 --> 01:17:24.203
I won't say anything, I promise.

01:17:24.270 --> 01:17:26.038
That's not how it works.

01:17:26.105 --> 01:17:28.565
I got to protect my son now

01:17:28.566 --> 01:17:30.835
and talking to you ain't
gonna do him any favors.

01:17:33.362 --> 01:17:35.548
Can you at least tell
him that I love him?

01:17:37.575 --> 01:17:39.969
Don't ask that, Jade.
That's not fair.

01:17:40.077 --> 01:17:43.180
You go to college,
you start your life.

01:17:43.330 --> 01:17:45.850
That's the best thing you
can do for David now.

I guess my dad wanted
me to talk to someone.

01:18:31.629 --> 01:18:34.130
I've been going to your
dad's shop for a long time,

01:18:34.131 --> 01:18:35.900
and he's never made
this call, so...

01:18:36.050 --> 01:18:38.277
I guess he wants me to feel better.

the rest of my life.

I just... I love it here.

01:19:13.629 --> 01:19:16.107
I'm sorry. Do you want
me to leave you alone?

01:19:16.173 --> 01:19:19.985
No. I'm just missing home.

It's slow and it's
painful, but it works.

01:19:27.893 --> 01:19:29.144
Talking helps.

01:19:29.145 --> 01:19:31.956
Going out with other
people, seeing friends.

01:19:31.981 --> 01:19:34.583
<i>And she'll be like a

01:19:34.650 --> 01:19:36.026

You know? It's the life...

01:19:42.074 --> 01:19:43.491
You think that's possible?

01:19:43.492 --> 01:19:47.704
If you trust that if it's meant
to be, then it will be again.

01:19:47.705 --> 01:19:51.416
<i>And if it's not, you
will wake up one day</i>

don't understand that.

01:20:32.750 --> 01:20:34.685
Yeah, maybe I just didn't wanna.

What happened with your
mom, that was my fault.

I worked too hard.

01:20:41.967 --> 01:20:43.569
I didn't make her happy.

Maybe she never loved me.
I don't know.

I never fought for her.

01:20:54.063 --> 01:20:56.207
But I saw you and Jade together.

01:20:57.274 --> 01:20:58.876
She loved you.
