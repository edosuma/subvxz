00:49.338 --> 00:52.375
There's a tale told
somewhere south of Burma.

00:52.830 --> 00:55.629
It tells of one man's
rendez-vous with death.

00:56.426 --> 00:59.595
A man who, when pushed
far enough, retaliated.

01:00.475 --> 01:03.944
How he faced down an army
and spill a river of blood.

01:20.173 --> 01:23.119
Naysayers shake their
heads discounting the legend.

01:23.144 --> 01:24.917
But the fact remains...

01:25.296 --> 01:26.865
It's all true.

01:27.685 --> 01:29.312
I knew the man,

01:29.337 --> 01:30.774
and for a while,

01:31.376 --> 01:33.359
I loved him like a son.

02:20.230 --> 02:22.574
The French hightailed it in '54.

02:22.599 --> 02:25.360
And the US didn't yet
have boots on the ground.

02:26.351 --> 02:27.713
For a while,

02:27.895 --> 02:31.839
Indochina offered safe-haven to men
who had reached the end of the line.

02:32.735 --> 02:35.030
European war criminals, ex-Nazis,

02:35.030 --> 02:36.966
and other undesirables.

02:39.232 --> 02:42.051
Or men with a price on
their head in the west.

02:43.439 --> 02:44.694
Men like...

02:45.830 --> 02:47.255
Martin Tillman.

02:59.450 --> 03:00.381
(HE'S GOOD)

05:09.900 --> 05:12.421
The tiger and the elephant, gentlemen.

05:16.783 --> 05:18.555
(SPEAKS FRENCH)

05:21.554 --> 05:24.709
Mr Rastignac, may I have the honor?

05:45.212 --> 05:47.300
My name is Jean-Pierre Rastignac.

05:47.322 --> 05:49.272
I have been known by many names.

05:49.504 --> 05:51.797
But the one that I most
commonly associate with,

05:51.812 --> 05:53.857
is "The Executioner".

05:54.011 --> 05:55.822
I face you as an equal,

05:55.847 --> 05:59.234
with the exception of this blade,
we're quite fairly matched.

05:59.901 --> 06:02.250
They told me if I fought,

06:02.592 --> 06:03.996
I would go free.

06:04.027 --> 06:06.243
This fight was your salvation,

06:06.338 --> 06:07.789
But you lost.

06:48.153 --> 06:50.112
(GREAT! I LIKE THAT)

08:37.725 --> 08:39.626
You shouldn’t have done
that to the Corporal.

08:41.230 --> 08:44.347
I asked the guards, why a
colonial police station,

08:44.347 --> 08:46.178
with only one small jail

08:46.203 --> 08:48.150
would keep a prisoner for three years?

08:49.024 --> 08:51.507
They said, only you knew the answer.

08:52.247 --> 08:55.154
Most prisoners who end
up here, have no hope.

08:56.483 --> 08:57.512
I thought I might help...

08:57.512 --> 09:00.381
You come twice a week
with flowers for him?

09:02.346 --> 09:03.673
And he turns you away?

09:07.047 --> 09:08.196
I can bring you fruit.

09:08.996 --> 09:10.608
The food here is not healthy.

09:10.608 --> 09:11.784
I don't need your help.

09:13.870 --> 09:15.465
Don't waste your time on me.

09:16.339 --> 09:17.796
You're not a waste of time.

09:17.889 --> 09:19.510
You're just lost.

09:20.941 --> 09:22.538
I'll come see you again,

09:23.402 --> 09:25.139
in case you change you change your mind.

09:49.833 --> 09:51.704
That agent is here again.

09:52.131 --> 09:53.651
He is persistent.

09:53.735 --> 09:55.880
I can kill him if you order it.

09:55.905 --> 09:58.114
The world is changing, Boon.

09:58.948 --> 10:00.833
We must adapt with it.

10:08.636 --> 10:12.717
Isn't it your job to transition
the local police into power?

10:12.777 --> 10:15.177
The side effect being that
for a brief few years

10:15.202 --> 10:17.909
you need to beholden to the
authority of the French.

10:18.639 --> 10:20.252
Not the Vietnamese.

10:20.571 --> 10:23.039
Mr Harrison, what can I do for you?

10:23.343 --> 10:25.188
Ho Chi Min's strength
in the North grows

10:25.213 --> 10:27.933
as President Diem's influence
in the South diminishes.

10:28.411 --> 10:31.686
The Americans are watching and will
send more advisers within a year.

10:31.711 --> 10:34.214
You and your kind

10:34.762 --> 10:37.666
will have to find a different
fleapit to lord over.

10:38.078 --> 10:39.260
Perhaps...

10:41.261 --> 10:44.035
I might be a valuable assistance
to you when they arrive.

10:44.035 --> 10:45.636
At what price to me?

10:47.118 --> 10:49.025
MI6 would like to
extradite Martin Tillman

10:49.050 --> 10:51.005
to face criminal charges
in Great Britain.

10:52.280 --> 10:53.994
There's no-one of that name here.

10:55.131 --> 10:58.002
You're overlooking a potential
opportunity here, Colonel.

11:00.205 --> 11:01.610
I know what you did in the war.

11:02.019 --> 11:04.621
You'll need a friend like me if
you're gonna deal with the Americans.

11:04.621 --> 11:08.336
Corporal Chef Boon, please
escort Mr Harrison out.

11:20.439 --> 11:23.260
When I was a little girl,
I rescued a stray dog.

11:23.652 --> 11:26.339
A fighting dog that had
been left for dead.

11:27.141 --> 11:28.603
I look at those black eyes.

11:29.085 --> 11:31.105
and felt the ultimate betrayal.

11:31.510 --> 11:34.651
Some animals are not meant
to be caged, Martin.

11:37.320 --> 11:38.866
Why are you talking to me?

11:40.383 --> 11:41.853
You made some bad decisions,

11:41.878 --> 11:43.250
- that's all.
- Mademoiselle.

11:46.957 --> 11:48.630
I'll be back next week.

11:48.663 --> 11:49.713
Good-bye.

11:49.713 --> 11:51.742
Why do you bother coming back for him?

11:54.732 --> 11:56.775
We build our own cages, Martin.

12:19.359 --> 12:22.291
Alcohol is an easy paracil here.

12:22.365 --> 12:24.068
Like Jamaican rum.

12:24.644 --> 12:26.562
It'll help you forget your sins,

12:27.293 --> 12:29.620
without losing your edge.

12:32.053 --> 12:36.492
You assaulted a superior officer in '53.

12:36.517 --> 12:41.104
You've served three years
of a six month sentence.

12:41.129 --> 12:42.963
What does that tell you?

12:44.898 --> 12:47.494
Tells me that I'm not the only
criminal in this room.

12:51.726 --> 12:54.726
In the North you're
just an ex-legionnaire,

12:54.751 --> 12:57.735
with a price on his head. In
the South you're just another

12:57.735 --> 12:59.161
 ex-con.

12:59.293 --> 13:00.737
With no passport.

13:01.429 --> 13:05.393
That tattoo is a writ of
judgment against you.

13:05.418 --> 13:07.854
An execution warrant in Great Britain.

13:07.854 --> 13:10.044
You're not so dissimilar to us.

13:10.192 --> 13:11.615
Take...

13:12.187 --> 13:13.754
Señor Rastignac,

13:13.779 --> 13:15.561
Spanish Blue Division,

13:15.586 --> 13:18.307
fought heroically for the Third Reich,

13:18.332 --> 13:22.688
Corporal Chef Boon of the Fifth
Vietnamese Paratroopers.

13:22.713 --> 13:27.004
Once a hero, now hunted by
the Viet Minh as a traitor.

13:28.019 --> 13:29.656
And Señor Amarillo,

13:30.720 --> 13:34.706
Loyal to Pertain, and fought
until the end of Berlin.

13:34.739 --> 13:36.092
Santé!

13:37.591 --> 13:40.868
This room is full of men who
backed the wrong horses, indeed.

13:43.920 --> 13:45.517
I'm feeling charitable.

13:46.362 --> 13:47.508
So...

13:48.002 --> 13:49.638
I'm fulfilling my

13:50.266 --> 13:51.872
obligation to you.

13:52.464 --> 13:53.880
I'm paroling you.

13:54.730 --> 13:56.358
Effective immediately.

14:03.683 --> 14:04.903
Are you saying I'm free to go?

14:05.532 --> 14:08.305
Our glorious run together is over.

14:10.040 --> 14:13.919
For most of us, Indochina
will be our last outpost.

14:14.304 --> 14:19.088
But perhaps we can work together
again under different circumstances.

14:24.345 --> 14:26.542
If you ever find yourself in Spode,

14:26.567 --> 14:29.578
I can always use a man
with a talent like yours.

14:32.714 --> 14:34.337
I think I'll just be moving along.

14:40.113 --> 14:41.637
Think about it, Martin.

14:41.662 --> 14:44.365
You don't look like a man
with many opportunities.

14:46.388 --> 14:47.686
You owe me now.

14:48.219 --> 14:51.888
You ever see me again, don't you
dare presume to forget that.

15:00.059 --> 15:01.746
Are you sure this is wise?

15:01.771 --> 15:04.554
I want that British agent
out of my affairs.

15:09.631 --> 15:11.273
The old Colonel was right.

15:11.413 --> 15:13.340
Martin wouldn't go far.

15:14.081 --> 15:16.985
He headed to the only person
he knew outside of the camp;

15:17.010 --> 15:18.857
which is where I met him.

15:20.907 --> 15:23.559
This is Martin, the one I
was telling you about.

15:25.518 --> 15:27.300
I have to leave now,

15:27.454 --> 15:29.670
I want the two of
you to be friends.

15:34.161 --> 15:36.535
It's nice seeing you
again, Martin Tillman.

15:42.698 --> 15:45.521
There was once an Irish
boxer named Tillman,

15:45.521 --> 15:47.158
showed potential,

15:47.678 --> 15:49.092
then disappeared.

15:50.618 --> 15:53.750
Looked after her since she was
knee-high with a jack rabbit.

15:54.106 --> 15:56.367
She believes in the good in man.

15:57.290 --> 15:58.420
I don't.

16:00.656 --> 16:02.900
Tell me where I can get a
meal and I'll be leaving.

16:02.939 --> 16:04.668
I have no beef with you, son,

16:05.525 --> 16:07.202
and I could use a good bouncer.

16:07.883 --> 16:09.820
You look like you can handle yourself.

16:10.588 --> 16:12.211
She says you're straight shooter.

16:12.391 --> 16:14.553
When I was inside, she'd
visit every week.

16:15.868 --> 16:18.346
Always bringing flowers
for the Commandant.

16:18.575 --> 16:19.924
You don't know?

16:20.747 --> 16:22.896
God bless her innocent heart.

16:22.998 --> 16:24.180
Give me the picture.

16:27.867 --> 16:31.244
I'll be damned if that old
flesh merchant, Hans Steiner

16:31.545 --> 16:33.422
is her own father.

16:34.061 --> 16:36.039
Take some flowers once a week,

16:36.137 --> 16:39.352
in the hope that he'll sit her
on his knee and kiss her cheek.

16:39.723 --> 16:41.307
He refuses to see her.

16:41.674 --> 16:44.686
Steiner married his
Kong gai, local girl,

16:44.686 --> 16:46.847
whom he later suspected
of deceiving him.

16:46.872 --> 16:49.720
When Isabelle was born, that
gave him sufficient reason to...

16:49.720 --> 16:51.402
deny her.

16:52.835 --> 16:55.576
I was Steiner's valet,
saw the whole thing.

16:55.905 --> 16:57.598
Adopted Isabelle.

16:58.718 --> 17:01.075
She deserves better than either of us.

17:01.890 --> 17:05.804
You ever hurt Isabelle, I'll kill
you faster than I can shank a salmon.

17:06.653 --> 17:08.819
And that's damn quick, boy.

17:14.766 --> 17:17.563
There's an old storage shed
out back you can bunk in.

17:17.711 --> 17:19.980
You'll mostly deal with drunks.

17:20.056 --> 17:22.683
Every so often some
lame duck paws a girl.

17:23.269 --> 17:25.262
They get one polite request.

17:25.789 --> 17:29.718
Then, do whatever it takes.

17:54.966 --> 17:56.073
Xie-xie.

17:57.241 --> 17:57.978
Thank you.

18:05.389 --> 18:06.554
That'll do it.

18:07.702 --> 18:09.807
You know, you're just
like I was, Martin.

18:09.832 --> 18:11.515
But you ain't so old,

18:11.666 --> 18:13.590
you can still change your path.

18:13.615 --> 18:15.336
I'm nothing like you.

18:15.489 --> 18:17.131
I'm young, handsome,

18:17.131 --> 18:18.632
and I burn in the sun.

18:18.657 --> 18:20.101
You, son of a bitch!

18:20.758 --> 18:22.174
Well, I have to say...

18:23.437 --> 18:25.378
You're the only person in my whole life

18:26.314 --> 18:28.499
who went out of his way to help me.

18:30.490 --> 18:31.858
I appreciate that.

18:43.312 --> 18:45.833
Even the worst of us wants to be loved,

18:45.879 --> 18:47.518
and for a time,

18:47.595 --> 18:49.835
Martin enjoyed a peace

18:49.882 --> 18:51.820
he'd never known before.

18:58.509 --> 19:02.666
Bow! Valentine! Sweet lil' emoti...
Merry! Sweet lil' emot...

19:12.321 --> 19:14.248
He was a free prisoner,

19:14.384 --> 19:15.957
She was an innocent,

19:16.117 --> 19:19.913
who would watch her injured
patient limp back to life.

19:20.659 --> 19:24.248
It was only natural that they would
develop feelings for each other.

19:40.289 --> 19:42.329
I'm not sure if Valentine'd like...

20:01.829 --> 20:03.834
Is that what you believe in?

20:03.859 --> 20:05.769
No, I was never a believer.

20:09.924 --> 20:11.581
I joined the fight because...

20:12.507 --> 20:14.664
My Dad and my brother went ahead of me.

20:15.750 --> 20:18.010
Where I come from, that's
just what you did.

20:24.142 --> 20:26.695
Your home is here now, Martin Tillman.

20:28.995 --> 20:30.802
Leave the past behind.

20:40.529 --> 20:44.226
It was a shame as I told you
last night, you fucked a penguin.

20:46.017 --> 20:49.800
You know, it's so damned easy
to get so wrapped up in life

20:49.800 --> 20:52.639
that you miss the precious
moments like this.

20:52.882 --> 20:54.450
Toast to the future!

20:54.729 --> 20:55.957
The future!

20:56.296 --> 20:58.425
Well we damn sure ain't
drinking to the past!

20:58.588 --> 21:01.120
We're not going back to
where we have been before.

21:01.485 --> 21:03.057
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

21:05.647 --> 21:07.979
No, seriously, Jack, I
was out in New York

21:08.472 --> 21:09.340
Two weeks.

21:10.797 --> 21:11.675
Tell me what?

21:11.773 --> 21:12.963
Have you broken your hands?

21:12.988 --> 21:16.396
How could I have broken my hands?
I'd become a fucking beggar.

21:18.144 --> 21:19.144
Fair enough.

21:20.305 --> 21:21.406
Never let it go.

21:22.282 --> 21:23.570
(INDISTINCTIVE)

21:34.181 --> 21:35.449
Get the fuck out of here!

21:38.016 --> 21:39.411
Who's this cunt think he is, huh?

21:44.480 --> 21:46.315
You got somethin' to say to our lads?

21:46.340 --> 21:49.457
There's a pretty penny out
there for legion deserters.

21:49.482 --> 21:50.652
You know that?

21:50.677 --> 21:53.881
You look like a fellow who
likes a good tear up.

21:54.103 --> 21:55.417
Well, you know what?

21:56.068 --> 21:58.563
This is your lucky day son, cos so do I.

22:01.030 --> 22:02.030
Listen!

22:05.490 --> 22:07.747
Is that your knees I hear knocking?

22:19.803 --> 22:20.884
Go home!

22:21.713 --> 22:23.774
If the idea is to have a fight,

22:23.799 --> 22:26.169
there's your fucking chance.

23:31.768 --> 23:32.661
Martin!

23:36.866 --> 23:38.123
That's enough!

23:39.160 --> 23:40.498
You did your job!

23:52.761 --> 23:55.448
- I told you I'm fine, OK?
- You're not fine.

23:55.471 --> 23:57.493
- I'm fine!
- Turn your head.

23:58.190 --> 23:59.190
Turn your head.

23:59.538 --> 24:01.050
You're a big baby.

24:17.175 --> 24:18.518
Now it makes sense.

24:19.478 --> 24:21.327
We're closed, come back tonight.

24:23.542 --> 24:24.813
My country,

24:25.268 --> 24:26.658
my laws.

24:27.593 --> 24:28.624
My revolver.

24:30.294 --> 24:32.176
Martin and I are old friends.

24:32.736 --> 24:33.953
Care if I sit down?

24:35.059 --> 24:36.059
Not my call.

24:40.002 --> 24:41.002
Thank you.

24:42.938 --> 24:44.630
Isabelle, you better go. Come on.

24:45.202 --> 24:47.229
Does she still believe
she's Steiner's daughter?

24:47.254 --> 24:48.847
She is Steiner's daughter.

24:50.192 --> 24:52.167
A great expense our mutual friend

24:52.192 --> 24:54.664
Colonel Steiner flew
in a champion boxer.

24:54.689 --> 24:57.272
Last night, someone knocked him on cold.

24:57.297 --> 25:00.764
I decided I should meet
the responsible party.

25:01.285 --> 25:03.474
Mr Valentine told you we're closed.

25:04.006 --> 25:05.377
Why don't you come back tonight?

25:05.402 --> 25:08.571
You just burned the most
dangerous man in Indochina.

25:08.596 --> 25:11.496
Right now you need me more
than anyone else in the world.

25:12.794 --> 25:15.001
Why don't you come
back and fight for us?

25:16.542 --> 25:18.970
Steiner had the British
agent sent North.

25:18.995 --> 25:19.995
So...

25:21.160 --> 25:22.393
You can make some money.

25:22.667 --> 25:23.818
Life can be good.

25:25.429 --> 25:27.828
I'll take my chances here if
it's all the same with you.

25:28.841 --> 25:30.133
If you change your mind,

25:30.133 --> 25:31.756
you know where to find me.

25:36.402 --> 25:39.219
Steiner needs to relocate his operation.

25:40.434 --> 25:43.242
A bar like this would be a perfect fit.

25:53.261 --> 25:55.107
Not my favourite customer.

26:02.093 --> 26:03.507
We're closing early tonight.

26:09.056 --> 26:10.679
I brought you bad luck.

26:13.374 --> 26:15.652
Bad luck resides in our own conscience.

26:16.651 --> 26:18.642
We inflict it on ourselves.

26:21.290 --> 26:22.657
It seems to find me.

26:24.730 --> 26:26.007
Listen to me, son.

26:28.099 --> 26:30.765
I saw something inside you
out there in the rain.

26:32.747 --> 26:35.078
Maybe you need to stop
running away from it.

26:36.401 --> 26:37.401
Embrace it.

26:49.076 --> 26:50.076
Martin!

26:54.459 --> 26:56.271
I didn't think you'd be up this early.

26:58.174 --> 26:59.704
I'll pray for you.

27:03.334 --> 27:05.098
I want you to promise me something.

27:06.927 --> 27:08.810
Don't ever watch me fight.

27:09.509 --> 27:10.965
Or bet on me or...

27:10.965 --> 27:14.244
be any part of what happens to
me when I get into that ring.

27:15.265 --> 27:16.761
I don't understand.

27:19.068 --> 27:20.665
Something happens to me in there...

27:22.978 --> 27:24.951
It's a part of me I
don't want you to see.

27:27.225 --> 27:29.652
I bring bad luck to
the people around me.

27:42.752 --> 27:44.463
Martin Tillman.

27:49.043 --> 27:51.065
I've considered your offer, and...

27:53.521 --> 27:55.275
I believe I'll take you up on it...

27:56.586 --> 27:59.091
Well, that wasn't so difficult, was it?

28:30.961 --> 28:32.901
That's right! The champion's here!

28:34.009 --> 28:35.269
OK! He's here!

28:35.643 --> 28:36.897
And who's gonna win?

28:38.124 --> 28:39.554
Yes! The champ!

28:49.563 --> 28:50.563
Let's go! Let's go!

30:15.794 --> 30:17.238
Martin Tillman!

30:24.273 --> 30:25.655
What can I get you?

30:25.680 --> 30:28.099
Gin and tonic, highball, old boy.

30:29.282 --> 30:33.194
3 oz of gin to 4 oz of tonic water
splashed of lemon, if you have it.

30:34.029 --> 30:36.293
Think I could find some
lemon juice somewhere?

30:37.754 --> 30:39.836
I've been in the North.

30:39.939 --> 30:42.355
It's refreshing to hear
English spoken again.

30:44.418 --> 30:45.612
Diplomatic service?

30:46.494 --> 30:47.671
You might say that.

30:48.934 --> 30:50.761
I'm looking for an Irishman.

30:51.936 --> 30:52.936
A boxer.

30:54.223 --> 30:55.847
He was here but now he's gone.

30:56.804 --> 30:59.438
There are a hundred local
criminals in this vicinity.

30:59.463 --> 31:01.328
Nazis on the run, murderers,

31:01.328 --> 31:02.794
wanted war criminals.

31:02.819 --> 31:03.973
What's with this guy?

31:03.998 --> 31:06.579
In 1946, Martin Tillman set up

31:06.579 --> 31:10.110
several large bombs targeting
RUC and B-Special Units.

31:10.135 --> 31:13.357
We know he was working with his father
and brother who were part of the

31:13.357 --> 31:15.322
flying column for the IRA.

31:16.336 --> 31:18.283
But as they were killed
in one of the blasts,

31:20.413 --> 31:22.789
he's our loose end, you might say.

31:25.302 --> 31:26.783
Can't help you.

31:29.948 --> 31:33.551
Well, if he does turn up, you can
find me via the British Embassy.

31:36.490 --> 31:39.569
You look like a man that
could do with £10,000.

31:42.071 --> 31:46.077
The reward money for information
expediting his apprehension.

31:47.765 --> 31:52.331
D'you know what £10,000 looks like
in French Piastres, Mr Valentine?

32:17.924 --> 32:19.936
Get up! Get up! Come on! Get up!

34:12.400 --> 34:13.513
I hear...

34:13.538 --> 34:16.751
You give your money to Valentine.

34:18.973 --> 34:22.574
You ever wonder how you would
do in a regular boxing match?

34:22.600 --> 34:25.255
Big money in America.

34:25.282 --> 34:27.456
Madison Square Garden.

34:28.768 --> 34:29.768
Imagine that.

34:31.033 --> 34:32.551
I used to know people,

34:32.576 --> 34:34.752
politicians, investors,

34:34.777 --> 34:38.328
but I am SS Steiner.

34:38.887 --> 34:39.976
And you...

34:40.271 --> 34:42.777
are IRA Tillman.

34:44.338 --> 34:49.429
I was sentenced to death
by a War Tribunal in absentia.

34:49.960 --> 34:52.681
And you have the British
Secret Service hunting you.

34:52.706 --> 34:56.606
So, all that we shall ever be is this.

34:57.381 --> 34:59.463
What we are right now.

35:39.568 --> 35:41.295
Dearest Isabelle,

35:41.853 --> 35:44.477
I'm sorry I have not been in touch.

35:44.776 --> 35:48.209
I deeply, profoundly loved your mother.

35:48.234 --> 35:51.487
And I'm sure what you would really
wish for me to say is that,

35:52.514 --> 35:53.894
well that,

35:58.020 --> 35:59.514
I love you too.

36:05.471 --> 36:06.471
Well...

36:07.067 --> 36:09.657
Unfortunately, I do not.

36:09.682 --> 36:13.612
For you are, at best,
the daughter of a whore.

36:13.637 --> 36:16.691
and deserve no such dignity
for your wishful thinking.

36:16.716 --> 36:20.351
I was blinded by my own
lust and inexperience.

36:20.433 --> 36:22.460
I could never love a daughter

36:22.460 --> 36:24.949
of the woman who made
a cuckold out of me.

36:25.169 --> 36:28.358
You are nothing but another
faceless, vermin inhabitant

36:28.422 --> 36:31.353
this festering waste-land.

36:31.643 --> 36:32.840
Cordially,

36:33.486 --> 36:34.715
Hans Steiner.

36:50.145 --> 36:51.515
How you doing?

36:52.933 --> 36:54.393
Oh, we're winning so far.

36:57.180 --> 37:00.028
There was a British agent
here asking after you.

37:07.782 --> 37:10.070
Figured he'd catch up
to me, eventually.

37:10.095 --> 37:12.843
The money is good, Martin,
but I don't need it.

37:13.243 --> 37:14.481
Neither does Steiner.

37:15.074 --> 37:16.801
You can quit when you want.

37:19.999 --> 37:21.900
That's my military passport.

37:22.076 --> 37:23.713
You can put your picture on it.

37:24.460 --> 37:26.562
- Steiner won't like th...
- Forget Steiner!

37:27.401 --> 37:29.257
Take the money from tomorrow's fight.

37:29.282 --> 37:31.563
Go to America, take Isabelle with you.

37:31.588 --> 37:33.522
You're as good as
back in jail here.

37:33.547 --> 37:34.913
And you don't even know it.

37:37.515 --> 37:41.228
Go to the States, get
away, taste real freedom.

37:46.786 --> 37:47.983
What about you?

37:49.690 --> 37:52.627
I'll head South with my girl,
she's got family down there.

37:57.979 --> 37:59.530
I'll do the next fight,

38:00.406 --> 38:02.522
and I have to weeks til the next one.

38:02.547 --> 38:04.510
That'll give us time
to get out of 'em.

38:04.535 --> 38:06.666
Whatever wrong you've done,

38:06.691 --> 38:08.183
Doesn't matter to anybody.

38:09.529 --> 38:11.148
Until you decide,

38:12.231 --> 38:13.701
to go on living.

38:30.442 --> 38:33.465
100,000 French Piastres.

38:33.465 --> 38:35.600
That's the biggest pot
you've ever taken.

38:35.625 --> 38:39.395
However, no-one is betting
against you, so...

38:40.257 --> 38:43.461
The odds are no longer worthwhile, so...

38:43.486 --> 38:45.096
You want me to lose the fight?

38:45.981 --> 38:47.307
That was easy.

38:47.332 --> 38:49.232
I told you there'd be no problem.

38:51.620 --> 38:55.384
You give me a quarter of the gate,
I'll make it a fucking work of art.

38:57.107 --> 38:59.035
You better make it look real.

39:00.285 --> 39:03.640
You learnt a thing for
yourself, Martin, that's good.

39:04.738 --> 39:08.419
Lose well, Martin Tillman,
your life depends on it.

39:17.325 --> 39:21.126
I know, I know, strictly speaking,
I promised I wouldn't gamble.

39:22.423 --> 39:24.152
But it's a sure thing.

39:24.268 --> 39:28.404
But I did my research on this
guy, Martin will tear him apart.

39:29.640 --> 39:31.135
We'll go South to your family.

39:31.579 --> 39:33.799
We'll buy a bar, a bigger one.

39:34.748 --> 39:37.615
Thailand, maybe, yeah.

39:37.640 --> 39:40.492
When the Europeans start arriving,
the Americans will be next.

39:40.517 --> 39:43.439
And we'll be in a great position
to make some money.

39:43.464 --> 39:45.255
How much did you gamble?

39:45.280 --> 39:48.270
Don't you worry your pretty
little head about it.

39:48.270 --> 39:52.304
(Speaks Chinese)

39:52.329 --> 39:54.380
Wait, wait, wait! Just wait a minute!

42:35.960 --> 42:39.642
This evening, many people found
out that their great hero

42:39.642 --> 42:41.404
has no honor.

42:48.173 --> 42:49.845
They're in the bar waiting for you.

43:02.215 --> 43:03.399
Look, look, look!

43:03.424 --> 43:04.867
Here come our gentlemen now.

43:09.398 --> 43:10.561
OK, fellas?

43:11.672 --> 43:12.672
How did I do?

43:13.563 --> 43:14.679
You lost.

43:17.840 --> 43:18.810
What?

43:18.835 --> 43:21.630
You have until the end
of the week to vacate.

43:21.630 --> 43:24.088
The deed to this property,

43:24.113 --> 43:26.579
everything and
everything inside,

43:26.604 --> 43:28.879
now belongs to Monsieur Rastignac

43:29.151 --> 43:30.731
Martin lost?

43:31.830 --> 43:32.855
You knew?

43:32.880 --> 43:35.966
You knew he was going to lose
but he let Valentine gamble?

43:35.991 --> 43:37.435
You son of a bitch!

43:38.762 --> 43:40.346
Watch your tongue, black.

43:41.053 --> 43:42.726
You don't wanna upset me.

43:43.295 --> 43:46.135
You're awful! All of
you, cowardy cheats.

43:46.160 --> 43:48.874
Not one of you has a thing up
to your bearing on Valentine.

43:51.260 --> 43:52.958
You should be ashamed.

43:54.017 --> 43:55.495
You and your pig.

43:59.769 --> 44:01.019
Knock it off!

44:01.938 --> 44:02.938
That's enough!

44:04.353 --> 44:06.064
You've taken enough from us tonight.

44:06.394 --> 44:08.201
Don't take anything more.

44:08.550 --> 44:09.756
It ends here!

44:09.771 --> 44:12.075
And no Spaniard in a cheap suit

44:12.100 --> 44:14.643
with a paid-off contract
is gonna take anymore.

44:14.668 --> 44:15.934
You understand?

44:16.666 --> 44:18.051
Put it down, Valentine.

44:20.025 --> 44:21.085
It's not fair.

44:21.926 --> 44:23.220
You're not a killer.

44:44.723 --> 44:46.559
What are you doing?

44:49.323 --> 44:51.515
Everything OK, Valentine?

45:23.796 --> 45:25.354
So, there you have it.

45:25.812 --> 45:28.865
Killed by three slugs with my own 45.

45:29.701 --> 45:31.911
Everything just ceased to matter.

45:32.474 --> 45:33.559
Not my life,

45:33.817 --> 45:34.749
the bar,

45:35.085 --> 45:36.085
anything.

45:36.870 --> 45:38.235
I just signed off.

45:43.025 --> 45:45.463
It was a different story
with Martin and Isabelle.

45:57.885 --> 46:00.200
The thing about a sawn-off shotgun is

46:00.200 --> 46:02.714
it's sheer hell at close range.

46:02.739 --> 46:05.818
But over a throw, not so much.

46:06.422 --> 46:08.423
The force of the hit dropped Martin,

46:08.471 --> 46:10.014
knocked him cold,

46:10.194 --> 46:12.272
but it had missed everything vital.

46:14.091 --> 46:15.831
Likewise with Isabelle,

46:15.856 --> 46:18.430
the 45 that had finished me,

46:18.430 --> 46:20.007
passed right through her.

46:20.032 --> 46:21.930
She was a healthy, young woman.

46:22.098 --> 46:28.184
And now, it's said the human
is the hardest animal to kill.

46:50.196 --> 46:53.235
Martin had never had
much call for religion.

46:53.537 --> 46:56.823
But there in the jungle he
reacquainted himself with his Maker.

46:56.848 --> 46:59.748
He begged God to let him die there.

46:59.773 --> 47:03.715
To take his life in
exchange for saving hers.

47:03.740 --> 47:06.459
He offered God a proposal,

47:06.459 --> 47:10.740
if she died, he'd follow her
into the twilight kingdom.

47:11.042 --> 47:12.195
But if she lived,

47:12.195 --> 47:15.399
it would become his mission
to quench with death

47:15.399 --> 47:18.007
those responsible for what had happened.

47:26.232 --> 47:28.358
She deserves better than either of us.

47:34.248 --> 47:36.525
I bring bad luck to
the people around me.

47:39.370 --> 47:41.782
Bad luck resides in our own conscience.

47:45.514 --> 47:47.319
We inflict it on ourselves.

48:46.535 --> 48:48.589
Though it broke his heart,

48:49.025 --> 48:50.426
Martin knew

48:51.108 --> 48:53.718
he could never see her again.

48:54.205 --> 48:57.331
It had never been so God
damned clear as it was then.

48:57.902 --> 49:01.768
He would have to kill them
all, only then could it end.

49:01.838 --> 49:02.943
Steiner,

49:02.968 --> 49:04.258
Rastignac,

49:04.600 --> 49:06.806
Amarillo and Boon.

49:07.530 --> 49:08.998
Just four men

49:09.981 --> 49:11.792
were in Martin's mind.

49:12.167 --> 49:15.736
Four reasons his life
had been destroyed.

(SPEAKS A FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

50:45.841 --> 50:47.756
(SPEAKS FRENCH)

50:54.685 --> 50:56.428
And I heard a voice,

50:56.453 --> 50:58.761
in the midst of the four beasts.

50:59.273 --> 51:00.630
And I looked,

51:01.088 --> 51:03.272
and behold a pale horse,

51:04.027 --> 51:06.737
and his name that sat on him was death

51:07.277 --> 51:09.682
and hell followed with him.

51:10.999 --> 51:13.265
I'm looking for Rastignac and Steiner.

51:13.290 --> 51:14.290
Why?

51:19.993 --> 51:21.251
Rastignac

51:22.142 --> 51:23.695
and Steiner.

51:24.820 --> 51:28.812
(SPEAKS A FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

51:36.270 --> 51:38.183
Don't go inside. No fight.

51:59.637 --> 52:00.958
Cognac for you.

52:16.511 --> 52:17.710
Martin!

52:24.880 --> 52:26.226
Give him a drink!

52:28.348 --> 52:30.465
No, no, give him the good stuff!

52:32.230 --> 52:33.294
See?

52:33.641 --> 52:36.455
The thing that Martin knew
that they didn't was,

52:36.739 --> 52:38.508
that in a bar fight,

52:38.975 --> 52:40.926
the man with nothing to lose,

52:41.553 --> 52:43.583
was the man to bet on.

52:45.547 --> 52:47.011
I'm gonna kill you.

52:49.324 --> 52:52.528
And if your men try to stop me,
I'll fucking kill them too.

52:53.070 --> 52:54.967
A wise man once said:

52:54.992 --> 52:59.165
"Fear the hanged man because
he's dead already".

54:11.925 --> 54:13.746
Martin Tillman is still alive.

54:15.232 --> 54:18.061
He walked in Valentine's
bar with just a machete,

54:18.114 --> 54:19.520
killed everyone!

54:20.014 --> 54:22.601
They had machine guns,
shotguns, Steiner!

54:22.626 --> 54:24.940
He kept them down like
they weren't even there.

54:24.965 --> 54:26.037
Like a demon.

54:26.037 --> 54:29.243
A fighter, you killed that bear,
it has come back to life.

54:32.040 --> 54:34.273
I'll just find him and kill him again.

54:36.065 --> 54:39.671
You would allow it for the
gentle rule of exaggeration.

54:39.690 --> 54:42.337
I'd say we have a problem on our hands.

54:43.356 --> 54:45.550
Are you afraid, Steiner?

54:46.795 --> 54:48.275
You're getting old.

54:53.080 --> 54:55.540
Let's just say I'm not
taking any chances.

54:56.691 --> 54:58.924
I'll kill anyone I find to be a threat.

54:58.949 --> 55:01.917
But he can't do anything to us.
What can he do to us?

55:01.942 --> 55:05.371
He'll go after our money, that's
where I would strike first.

55:05.564 --> 55:08.591
Our money is at my safe, at the villa.

55:08.760 --> 55:10.217
I have to stay here.

55:11.118 --> 55:13.798
There's a full squad
there, they're armed.

55:13.823 --> 55:14.869
You'll be fine.

55:15.238 --> 55:19.267
No, I'm deeply sorry, I'm not going.

55:19.292 --> 55:21.268
I am not going.

55:21.293 --> 55:23.948
Take Constantine,
he'll take care of you.

56:00.359 --> 56:02.964
He'd had to be out of
his mind to come here.

56:02.964 --> 56:04.753
If he does, I'll kill him.

56:05.230 --> 56:08.778
Then I'll buy dinner as an
apology for this inconvenience.

58:03.072 --> 58:05.458
there is enough for both of us, look!

We can get out of this.

58:08.779 --> 58:09.690
Look!

58:23.788 --> 58:25.618
I've been prepared to die,

58:25.643 --> 58:27.995
so many times in my life.

58:29.004 --> 58:31.704
This man is so repugnant.

59:49.395 --> 59:51.957
A man should go before his Maker

59:54.294 --> 59:55.887
properly attired.

01:00:05.265 --> 01:00:09.420
Today we're mobilizing an entire
strike force to keep one man

from entering a police station.

01:00:12.485 --> 01:00:14.928
Consider him deceased, my friend.

01:00:15.391 --> 01:00:16.245
Let's go!

01:00:27.911 --> 01:00:30.095
What would you think of me?

01:00:44.249 --> 01:00:47.311
For as long as he could remember,
Martin had been fighting.

01:00:47.550 --> 01:00:49.500
Whether it was harassing the English,

01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:53.148
hunting the Viet Minh or even
knocking fellas down for money.

01:00:53.617 --> 01:00:56.330
Martin had fought for many things.

01:00:56.951 --> 01:00:58.636
But never for revenge.

01:00:59.591 --> 01:01:02.352
Revenge was pure, it was simple

01:01:02.377 --> 01:01:06.028
and it would allow almost any
means to achieve its end.

01:01:06.509 --> 01:01:08.947
No matter how ruthless.

01:01:15.658 --> 01:01:18.030
Now, it wasn't as though Martin had any

01:01:18.330 --> 01:01:21.016
premonition or innate
strategic knowledge.

01:01:21.221 --> 01:01:22.731
He just figured,

01:01:22.804 --> 01:01:25.746
it wasn't a good plan to
go through the front door.

01:03:29.665 --> 01:03:30.877
Grenade!

01:03:59.988 --> 01:04:01.576
No, not that easy.

01:04:02.337 --> 01:04:03.213
Go!

01:04:03.737 --> 01:04:05.217
Go! go!

01:04:48.051 --> 01:04:50.571

in the front door!

01:05:03.480 --> 01:05:04.356

01:05:05.065 --> 01:05:06.012
Go!

01:05:08.874 --> 01:05:10.514
Marc will stay here.

01:05:10.539 --> 01:05:12.179
Pussies.

01:05:24.913 --> 01:05:26.072
Take it!

01:06:09.023 --> 01:06:10.663
Look at this face.

01:06:12.364 --> 01:06:13.954
Look into my eyes!

01:06:14.566 --> 01:06:17.214

faced that before?

Better men than you have tried.

01:06:20.870 --> 01:06:22.465
I will not...

01:06:22.637 --> 01:06:25.533
I will not allow you the satisfaction.

01:06:25.979 --> 01:06:28.623
You're a scum that got
lucky for a day or two.

01:06:29.563 --> 01:06:32.110
I... am an aristocrat.

01:07:33.263 --> 01:07:34.713
I was a fighter once.

01:07:38.086 --> 01:07:39.631
Let's see how good you are.

01:07:41.935 --> 01:07:43.485
I have no fight with you.

01:07:46.283 --> 01:07:47.283
You're wrong.

01:07:50.282 --> 01:07:52.028
This place was my life.

01:07:52.562 --> 01:07:54.272
I supported my parents,

01:07:54.863 --> 01:07:55.863
my wife,

01:07:56.776 --> 01:07:57.981
my children...

01:07:59.373 --> 01:08:00.726
Now I have nothing.

01:08:06.670 --> 01:08:08.474
I can't help you with that.

01:08:08.499 --> 01:08:10.374
There's a price on your head, Irishman.

01:08:10.772 --> 01:08:12.562
That's good enough.

01:10:51.402 --> 01:10:52.888
Turn the guns around, he's coming!

01:10:58.533 --> 01:11:00.525
It's not until you face death,

01:11:00.570 --> 01:11:02.888
that you truly appreciate life.

01:11:03.894 --> 01:11:07.105
Wait for him to leave cover,
then fire on my command.

01:11:22.602 --> 01:11:24.607
What are you doing, Martin?

01:11:38.751 --> 01:11:40.010
Fire!

01:11:59.403 --> 01:12:00.593
Cease fire!

01:12:02.417 --> 01:12:04.239
Pierre, go check on the target.

01:12:04.239 --> 01:12:07.151
The rest of you be ready to provide
cover and fire on my command.

01:12:34.634 --> 01:12:37.399
Never send a boy to do a man's job.

01:12:48.244 --> 01:12:50.678
Señor Artignac, where are you going?

01:13:25.304 --> 01:13:26.451
Give me your gun!

01:14:02.740 --> 01:14:04.717
He's fighting a commitment.

01:14:06.406 --> 01:14:08.154
To the building, now!

01:14:54.301 --> 01:14:56.119
You wanna live or you wanna die?

01:14:56.119 --> 01:14:57.506
I wanna live!

01:15:05.646 --> 01:15:08.269
Losing your appetite for blood, Martin?

01:15:14.592 --> 01:15:15.779
Not really.

01:15:16.112 --> 01:15:19.943
Not many men I've granted the
opportunity to duel for their life.

01:16:51.683 --> 01:16:53.995
(THEY SPEAK A FOREIGN  LANGUAGE)

01:18:48.592 --> 01:18:51.780
Bedfellows like money and
power billet together.

01:18:52.471 --> 01:18:54.531
Rastignac had lost his money,

01:18:54.556 --> 01:18:57.162
and all of his influence along with it.

01:18:57.749 --> 01:18:58.749
With no collateral,

01:18:59.504 --> 01:19:01.927
He was just another no-account European

01:19:01.952 --> 01:19:03.920
of innate depravity.

01:19:46.780 --> 01:19:49.008
Rastignac's treatment of the locals,

01:19:49.033 --> 01:19:51.776
had earned him many enemies
amongst the natives.

01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:09.569
Word had spread of Martin's
quest to avenge the local girl...

01:20:10.073 --> 01:20:11.790
earning him great sympathy.

01:20:12.562 --> 01:20:14.426
With Rastignac's soldiers gone,

01:20:14.721 --> 01:20:16.174
his fortune lost,

01:20:16.932 --> 01:20:19.085
it would be man against man,

01:20:19.989 --> 01:20:22.241
just the way Martin wanted it.

01:20:53.941 --> 01:20:56.219
The matador's relationship with the bull

01:20:56.244 --> 01:20:58.289
is closer than with anyone.

01:20:59.785 --> 01:21:01.046
They both know

01:21:01.046 --> 01:21:04.028
that only one of them will
leave the ring alive.

01:21:05.311 --> 01:21:06.721
You won, Martin.

01:21:07.563 --> 01:21:09.155
I'm not running anymore.

01:21:19.589 --> 01:21:20.656
It's empty.

01:21:40.184 --> 01:21:42.159
Let's do this like gentlemen.

01:22:02.323 --> 01:22:04.364
My name is Jean-Pierre Rastignac.

01:22:04.389 --> 01:22:06.495
I have been known by many names.

01:22:07.071 --> 01:22:09.995
But the one with which I
most commonly associate,

01:22:10.020 --> 01:22:11.714
is "The Executioner".

01:22:12.618 --> 01:22:14.630
I face you as an equal,

01:22:16.089 --> 01:22:18.169
with the exception
of this blade,

01:22:18.836 --> 01:22:20.852
we're quite fairly matched.

01:26:33.249 --> 01:26:35.101
This is for Valentine.

01:26:55.381 --> 01:26:56.479
Watch me.

01:28:29.296 --> 01:28:30.833
Dearest Isabelle,

01:28:30.858 --> 01:28:32.399
I trust you're well.

01:28:32.526 --> 01:28:35.270
I'm sorry I have not been in touch.

01:28:35.494 --> 01:28:38.863
I deeply, profoundly loved your mother.

01:28:38.888 --> 01:28:42.109
And I'm sure what you would really
wish for me to say is that,

01:28:42.134 --> 01:28:44.172
I love you too.

01:28:54.065 --> 01:28:55.763
It's been some time, Martin.

01:28:59.913 --> 01:29:03.220
We can make the railroad
in Saigon by 4 PM.

01:29:04.193 --> 01:29:06.040
Take the train to the airport.

01:29:06.194 --> 01:29:09.751
We can be in London in two days where
you'll stand trial for murder.

01:29:12.074 --> 01:29:13.809
But you'll probably kill me first.

01:29:14.714 --> 01:29:15.714
So...

01:29:16.101 --> 01:29:17.101
What?

01:29:21.496 --> 01:29:23.106
You can work for me.

01:29:25.978 --> 01:29:28.780
I've been ordered to assemble
a team of local operatives.

01:29:29.004 --> 01:29:31.402
Men with your skills are
a commodity, Tillman.

01:29:32.563 --> 01:29:34.203
Indochina is changing,

01:29:36.155 --> 01:29:37.694
and so must we.

01:29:55.021 --> 01:29:57.230
Christ never gave him much.

01:29:57.230 --> 01:30:00.291
but a God-awful talent
for carnage and death.

01:30:01.446 --> 01:30:03.909
There was no need for
him to deny it now.

01:30:04.135 --> 01:30:05.573
He was a killer,

01:30:06.175 --> 01:30:08.475
and that's all there was to it.

01:30:11.595 --> 01:30:13.367
And so was born...

01:30:14.617 --> 01:30:16.030
The Legend.
