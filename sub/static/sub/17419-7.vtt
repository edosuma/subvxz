What are you guys doing here?

00:13.233 --> 00:14.767
- We're taking you out, bro.
- That's right.

00:14.768 --> 00:15.768
- Mm-mm.
- You're gonna come out

00:15.769 --> 00:17.653
dancing... with us.

00:17.654 --> 00:19.572
BOTH (in rhythm): Come dancing, with us.

00:19.573 --> 00:20.856
Hey, I'm not going dancing with you.

00:20.857 --> 00:22.441
I'd-I'd-I'd feel like a third wheel.

00:22.442 --> 00:23.776
What are you talking about?

00:23.777 --> 00:25.110
Well, it's a couples thing.

00:25.111 --> 00:26.495
It'd be super-awkward and weird.

00:26.496 --> 00:28.931
No. What? that's insane.
You're being insane.

00:28.932 --> 00:30.349
Yeah. Okay...

00:30.350 --> 00:31.683
You're not gonna spend

00:31.684 --> 00:33.068
another Saturday playing video games.

00:33.069 --> 00:35.237
- Hmm?
- Yeah, okay, I'll...

00:35.238 --> 00:37.856
(sighs) I'll come for a little bit.

00:37.857 --> 00:39.156
- Yes!
- Yeah! All right, let's go.

00:39.158 --> 00:40.075

- All right, let's go.

00:40.076 --> 00:42.527
Uh, guys, when you said dancing,

00:42.528 --> 00:44.413
I really thought you meant, like, at a club

00:44.414 --> 00:46.415
- or a bar.
- No. We meant competitive ice dancing.

and they have terrific jobs,

03:17.416 --> 03:18.967

I'm serious, I don't think I could...

03:33.315 --> 03:37.101
I heard she's dating
some... new banker guy.

Their wedding Web site
said holy weaponry suggested.

04:23.899 --> 04:26.401
I read the Web site,
I'm just saying I'm only gonna

04:26.402 --> 04:29.320
use it once. It's just gonna
take up space in my closet.

04:29.321 --> 04:31.489
- Going to hell?
- Oh, my God. You know it.

04:31.490 --> 04:32.991
Yeah, we're, uh, we're real

04:32.992 --> 04:35.126
excited about it.
Do you have anything that is

04:35.127 --> 04:37.045
under $40?

04:37.046 --> 04:40.465
This one is $90. And it's

04:40.466 --> 04:42.800
- our most basic model.
- Why's it so

04:42.801 --> 04:43.918
- cheap?
- Well, the, uh,

04:43.919 --> 04:45.336
blade is unengraved, the

04:45.337 --> 04:46.588
handle is synthetic

04:46.589 --> 04:48.006
and it's cursed.

04:48.007 --> 04:49.641
- It's cursed?
- Yes, everyone

04:49.642 --> 04:51.426
who's bought it has been murdered.

04:51.427 --> 04:53.928
- You said $90? No sword for me.
- That's right.

04:53.929 --> 04:55.763
For $90... you ain't gonna
do much better than that, bro.

04:55.764 --> 04:57.765
Okay, well, I'm not made of $90.

04:57.766 --> 04:58.766
- Thank you.
- What about you,

04:58.767 --> 05:00.435
- my friend?
- Uh, ba, ba, ba,

05:00.436 --> 05:03.354
ba, ba... Let's go pewter this time.

05:03.355 --> 05:06.574
Pewter. The man's metal. Good choice.

05:06.575 --> 05:09.277
Might I suggest a goatskin

05:09.278 --> 05:11.863
- sheathe?
- Andros, you old bastard,

05:11.864 --> 05:13.915
you know me better than I know myself.

05:13.916 --> 05:15.033
- You got it.
- Mm.

05:15.034 --> 05:16.417
She's a beauty.

05:16.418 --> 05:18.586
- Definitely put this on my tab.
- Will do.

05:18.587 --> 05:20.538
- Ka!
- Whoa, Christ... Christ Almighty.

Becky is right now?

05:22.541 --> 05:24.008
- I-I don't know...
- Over the moon, right?

05:24.009 --> 05:25.927
- Y... Uh...
- Is that what you were gonna say?

05:25.928 --> 05:27.428
- N... Yeah.
- That's what I'm thinking.

05:27.429 --> 05:28.963
Okay. Hey, how you doing?

05:28.964 --> 05:30.798
- Hey, you know how Ben proposed?
- No.

05:30.799 --> 05:32.383
- Put it in a fortune cookie.
- Oh.

05:32.384 --> 05:33.935
- And then he lost it.
- Oh.

05:33.936 --> 05:35.726
- And then <i> she</i> found it.
- Okay.

05:35.728 --> 05:38.973
- They're telling me the story... <i>I</i> lost it. (laughs)
- Oh, yeah.

05:38.974 --> 05:41.142
- You see what I'm saying?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:41.143 --> 05:44.395
Oh, this wedding's gonna
be the best. Dancing, open bar.

05:44.396 --> 05:46.531
Open bar, there's always a tip jar.

05:46.532 --> 05:48.366
So you end up paying anyway.

05:48.367 --> 05:51.869
Oh, wouldn't it be amazing
if the ring was white gold?

05:51.870 --> 05:54.539
I, uh... No, not really.

05:54.540 --> 05:56.874

in her grandma's wedding dress.

05:56.875 --> 05:58.576
Isn't that adorable?

05:58.577 --> 06:01.245
No, she's probably
just trying to save money.

06:01.246 --> 06:02.747
Oh, man, I love it when they cut the cake

06:02.748 --> 06:04.799
and they wipe it
all over each other's faces.

06:04.800 --> 06:07.051
You mean-You mean,
like every single wedding?

06:07.052 --> 06:08.753
I hope they write their own vows. You know,

06:08.754 --> 06:10.755
- to personalize 'em?
- Yeah, you're right.

06:54.767 --> 06:57.101
I came here to celebrate our good friends.

Thought you had some work thing.

07:21.677 --> 07:24.179

10:04.983 --> 10:06.817
Yeah, it's...

16:41.486 --> 16:43.237
- Get up her butt.
- I'm sorry.

16:43.238 --> 16:45.573
You were saying something
about your life being bad?

16:45.574 --> 16:46.907
Oh, it's just, I don't know what happened.

16:46.908 --> 16:48.325
(small demon muttering)
I turned around and every

16:48.326 --> 16:50.077
single person I knew was getting married

16:50.078 --> 16:52.213
and starting careers, actual careers,

16:52.214 --> 16:53.831
(pained grunting) and I'm just a temp.

16:53.832 --> 16:56.384
And I'm single
and I just can't reconcile that

16:56.385 --> 16:58.552
- with everything I did right.
- SMALL DEMON: Go up that butt.

16:58.553 --> 17:00.254
I went to college, I got good grades,

17:00.255 --> 17:02.923

17:02.924 --> 17:06.143
