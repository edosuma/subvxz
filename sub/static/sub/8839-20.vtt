14:03.384 --> 14:05.218
JONATHAN,
YOU COME
WITH US.

14:05.386 --> 14:06.344
NO. I'LL BE BACK SOON.

14:06.512 --> 14:07.387
HE'S GOT
A SHOTGUN.

14:07.555 --> 14:08.680
I DON'T CARE!

14:08.848 --> 14:12.308
I DO! YOU'VE GOT US
TO THINK ABOUT, TOO!

14:13.686 --> 14:16.062
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S GET THE BOY HOME.

14:29.827 --> 14:31.744
WHOA.

14:35.666 --> 14:37.125
LORD GOD.

14:37.293 --> 14:40.753
MR. LARRABEE.
HE MUST HAVE COME BACK.

14:40.921 --> 14:44.007
ALICE, TAKE CARE
OF THE BOY.

14:44.174 --> 14:45.383
JONATHAN.

14:45.551 --> 14:48.636
DON'T WORRY.
I'M JUST GOING TO TOWN.

14:54.184 --> 14:57.020
NO! NELS! NELS!

14:57.187 --> 14:59.105
THIS DOESN'T CONCERN YOU!

14:59.273 --> 15:00.189
HARRIET...

15:00.357 --> 15:01.691
Harriet:
YOU'RE NOT A FARMER!

15:01.859 --> 15:03.192
GO TO BED.

15:03.360 --> 15:04.903
NELS, LISTEN TO ME.
NOW LISTEN TO ME.

15:05.070 --> 15:06.696
WOULD YOU JUST
LISTEN TO ME?
WHAT IF YOU GET SHOT?

15:06.864 --> 15:08.072
LET'S GO.

15:08.240 --> 15:11.284
NO, NELS. YOU DO HAVE
A WIFE AND A FAMILY
TO CONSIDER.

15:11.452 --> 15:12.869
HARRIET, GO TO BED!

15:13.037 --> 15:15.204
NELS, LISTEN TO ME!

15:15.372 --> 15:17.248
[HOOFBEATS]

15:28.052 --> 15:29.385
[BANGING ON DOOR]

15:29.553 --> 15:31.304
Charles: LARRABEE!

15:31.472 --> 15:33.348
LARRABEE, OPEN UP!

15:33.515 --> 15:34.599
JUDD, WHAT--

15:34.767 --> 15:36.976
STAY PUT.
I'LL HANDLE THIS.

15:38.354 --> 15:40.229
YOU CLEAR OFF
OF MY PROPERTY!
ALL OF YOU!

15:40.397 --> 15:42.982
Charles: YOU'RE ONLY
GOING TO MAKE THINGS
WORSE BY RESISTING.

15:43.150 --> 15:44.359
I'M GOING TO MAKE
THINGS A LOT WORSE

15:44.526 --> 15:46.152
IF YOU DON'T CLEAR OFF
OF MY PROPERTY!

15:46.320 --> 15:47.403
Jonathan: YOU OPEN
THAT DOOR, LARRABEE,

15:47.571 --> 15:48.738
OR WE'RE GOING TO
KNOCK IT DOWN!

15:48.906 --> 15:50.865
IT'S YOUR OWN FAULT
THAT YOUR BOY GOT HURT!

15:51.033 --> 15:54.118
YOU CLEAR OFF MY PROPERTY
UNLESS YOU WANT TO GET
YOUR HEAD BLOWED OFF!

15:54.286 --> 15:55.578
Nels: PUT THE GUN DOWN,
LARRABEE,

15:55.746 --> 15:58.206
REAL SLOW.

15:58.374 --> 16:00.500
IF ANYBODY'S GOING TO
GET HURT,

16:00.668 --> 16:02.377
IT'S GOING TO BE YOU.

16:02.544 --> 16:05.254
NOW, PUT IT DOWN SLOW.

16:08.759 --> 16:10.176
PA?

16:10.344 --> 16:14.263
PA, WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHAT DO ALL THESE MEN
WANT WITH YOU?

16:14.431 --> 16:17.350
UNLOCK THE DOOR.

16:20.437 --> 16:22.689
IT'S ALL RIGHT
OUT THERE!

16:24.441 --> 16:26.859
YOU BEAT UP MY SON!
YOU BEAT HIM UP!

16:27.027 --> 16:28.611
JONATHAN, LET GO!
LET GO!

16:28.779 --> 16:30.405
LET THE CIRCUIT JUDGE
HANDLE IT.

16:30.572 --> 16:32.323
WE'LL LOCK HIM
IN THE ICEHOUSE

16:32.491 --> 16:34.283
UNTIL THE JUDGE
GETS HERE THURSDAY.

16:34.451 --> 16:35.702
LET'S GO.

16:41.875 --> 16:43.710
I'M SORRY.

17:52.112 --> 17:54.072
Jonathan:
HOW'S YOUR HEAD, SON?

17:55.824 --> 17:58.493
I THINK YOU'D BEST STAY
HOME FROM SCHOOL TODAY.

17:58.660 --> 18:01.704
NO. DOC BAKER SAYS
NOT TO WORRY
ABOUT IT.

18:08.378 --> 18:10.338
HARD TO BELIEVE
THIS HAPPENED.

18:12.049 --> 18:16.302
EVERYTHING
WE'VE WORKED FOR
THIS WHOLE YEAR...

18:16.470 --> 18:18.346
GONE.

18:21.016 --> 18:24.560
LARRABEE. OH, GOD.

18:24.728 --> 18:26.479
AT LEAST
I'LL HAVE THE PLEASURE

18:26.647 --> 18:29.357
OF SEEING HIM ROT IN JAIL
FOR WHAT HE'S DONE.

18:41.620 --> 18:43.704
I'D BEST
GET TO SCHOOL.

18:50.587 --> 18:53.089
WILL YOU ALL PLEASE
READ CHAPTERS 4 AND 5

18:53.257 --> 18:56.717
AND BE PREPARED FOR
A WRITTEN EXAMINATION
ON FRIDAY...

18:56.885 --> 18:58.261
OR MONDAY.

18:58.428 --> 19:00.221
THERE WILL BE
NO CLASS TOMORROW

19:00.389 --> 19:03.182
AND MAYBE FRIDAY
BECAUSE OF THE...

19:03.350 --> 19:07.103
TOWN BUSINESS THAT'S
TO BE CONDUCTED HERE.

19:07.271 --> 19:12.316
I HOPE YOU ALL TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF THIS FREE TIME TO STUDY.

19:12.484 --> 19:14.819
CLASS DISMISSED.

19:29.084 --> 19:31.377
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

19:31.545 --> 19:33.129
OK, I GUESS.

19:33.297 --> 19:35.590
JUST A LITTLE TIRED.

19:35.757 --> 19:38.176
WHY DON'T YOU GO
HOME AND GET
SOME REST?

19:38.343 --> 19:41.637
I'VE GOT SOME
THINGS I HAVE TO
FINISH UP HERE.

19:41.805 --> 19:43.431
OK.

19:48.187 --> 19:50.938
Boy: HEY, WHY DON'T
YOU LEAVE ME ALONE?

19:51.106 --> 19:53.649
Different boy:
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
WORRIED ABOUT YOUR PA?

19:53.817 --> 19:55.526
Boy: MIND YOUR OWN
BUSINESS.

19:55.694 --> 19:58.696
LISTEN TO HIM.
HEY, YOUR PA IS REALLY
GONNA GET IT TOMORROW.

19:58.864 --> 20:01.365
TODD, LEAVE HIM
ALONE.

20:01.533 --> 20:02.825
WHY SHOULD I?

20:02.993 --> 20:05.828
'CAUSE I SAID SO.
NOW GO ON HOME.

20:05.996 --> 20:07.455
HEY, WHAT'S
THE MATTER WITH YOU?

20:07.623 --> 20:09.957
YOU ALREADY GOT
YOUR HEAD CRACKED OPEN
BY HIS PA.

20:10.125 --> 20:12.418
SO WHAT ARE YOU
STICKING UP FOR HIM FOR?

20:12.586 --> 20:14.003
'CAUSE I FEEL
LIKE IT.

20:14.171 --> 20:15.838
NOW LEAVE HIM BE.

20:16.006 --> 20:17.506
BOY, THAT BUMP
ON YOUR HEAD

20:17.674 --> 20:19.634
MUST HAVE SCRAMBLED
YOUR BRAINS.

20:19.801 --> 20:21.427
COME ON.

20:25.807 --> 20:27.725
WHY ARE YOU
STICKING UP FOR ME?

20:27.893 --> 20:30.019
IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT
WHAT YOUR PA DID.

20:30.187 --> 20:32.730
DON'T YOU NEVER MIND
WHAT MY PA DID.

20:32.898 --> 20:34.273
IT WAS YOUR PA
STARTED IT ANYHOW.

20:34.441 --> 20:36.692
WEREN'T FOR HIM,
NONE OF THIS WOULD
HAVE HAPPENED.

20:36.860 --> 20:39.695
JUST--JUST MIND
YOUR OWN BUSINESS.

20:46.870 --> 20:49.413
LORD, THANK YOU
FOR THIS FOOD.

20:49.581 --> 20:53.459
BLESS OUR FAMILY
AND OUR FRIENDS.

20:53.627 --> 20:56.545
FORGIVE ME, LORD,
FOR FEELING HATE.

20:56.713 --> 20:57.713
THAT CROP
WAS THE ONLY THING

20:57.881 --> 20:59.382
WE HAD COMING
FOR THIS WHOLE YEAR,

20:59.549 --> 21:03.427
AND IT'S GOING TO
TAKE ME A WHILE
TO GET OVER IT.

21:03.595 --> 21:05.680
THANKS FOR
UNDERSTANDING, LORD.

21:05.847 --> 21:07.056
AMEN.

21:07.224 --> 21:09.058
Alice and Andy: AMEN.

21:11.019 --> 21:13.771
LARRABEE'S BEEN
YELLING ABOUT
NOT BEING GUILTY

21:13.939 --> 21:15.273
OF BURNING
THAT BARN.

21:15.440 --> 21:17.858
I DON'T KNOW WHO HE
THINKS HE'S KIDDING.

21:18.026 --> 21:21.153
I WISH ANDY
DIDN'T HAVE TO
TESTIFY TOMORROW.

21:21.321 --> 21:24.490
THE BOY'S GOT TO
TESTIFY, ALICE.

21:24.658 --> 21:26.826
I KNOW.

21:28.745 --> 21:31.998
WELL, LEASTWISE,
IT SHOULDN'T
TAKE LONG ANYWAY.

21:34.751 --> 21:38.254
PA, WHAT ARE THEY GOING
TO DO TO MR. LARRABEE?

21:38.422 --> 21:40.006
LET'S NOT TALK
ABOUT IT.

21:40.173 --> 21:41.674
EAT YOUR SUPPER,
ANDY.

21:41.842 --> 21:43.342
YES, MA'AM.

22:08.535 --> 22:10.745
I CAN UNDERSTAND
JUDD LARRABEE

22:10.912 --> 22:12.788
CHEATING SOMEBODY ELSE,
BUT NOT ME.

22:12.956 --> 22:15.291
I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
HIS FRIEND.

22:15.459 --> 22:19.128
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,
HANGING'S TOO GOOD FOR HIM.

22:28.680 --> 22:30.181
TIME TO GO.

23:16.937 --> 23:21.857
Judge: IF YOU WOULD
REMAIN STANDING,
MR. LARRABEE.

23:25.404 --> 23:30.366
BARN-BURNING
IS A SERIOUS
FELONY OFFENSE.

23:30.534 --> 23:32.743
HOW DO YOU PLEAD?

23:32.911 --> 23:34.203
I NEVER BURNED
THAT BARN.

23:34.371 --> 23:37.540
IT'S A MATTER
OF RECORD THAT YOU
CONFESSED TO IT.

23:37.707 --> 23:41.502
I THOUGHT THEY WAS TALKING
ABOUT ME ACCIDENTALLY
PUSHING THAT BOY.

23:41.670 --> 23:43.129
VERY WELL.

23:43.296 --> 23:44.922
THEN YOU PLEAD
NOT GUILTY

23:45.090 --> 23:47.091
TO THE CHARGE
OF BARN-BURNING

23:47.259 --> 23:50.219
BUT GUILTY
TO THE CHARGE OF
ASSAULT AND BATTERY.

23:50.387 --> 23:52.721
AM I CORRECT?

23:52.889 --> 23:54.849
I RECKON.

23:56.560 --> 23:58.436
REVEREND ALDEN,
WOULD YOU AGREE

23:58.603 --> 24:01.313
TO ACT
AS JURY FOREMAN?

24:01.481 --> 24:03.232
I'D BE HAPPY TO SERVE
ON THE JURY, JUDGE PARKER.

24:03.400 --> 24:08.154
HOWEVER, AS TOWN PASTOR,
I FEEL THAT JURY FOREMAN
IS SOMEWHAT INAPPROPRIATE.

24:08.321 --> 24:10.865
THEN CAN YOU
RECOMMEND SOMEONE?

24:11.032 --> 24:12.491
WELL, YES, SIR.

24:12.659 --> 24:16.579
I THINK CHARLES INGALLS
WOULD DO AN ENTIRELY
RESPONSIBLE JOB.

24:16.746 --> 24:19.206
MR. INGALLS?

24:21.084 --> 24:22.251
YES, SIR?

24:22.419 --> 24:24.378
IS THAT AGREEABLE
WITH YOU?

24:24.546 --> 24:26.088
YEAH.
I SUPPOSE IT IS.

24:26.256 --> 24:28.549
THEN CHOOSE
YOUR JURY AND DO SO
WITH ALL SPEED.

24:28.717 --> 24:31.135
I HAVE PRESSING
BUSINESS ELSEWHERE.

24:32.596 --> 24:33.554
YES, YOUR HONOR.

24:33.722 --> 24:35.181
AS YOUR NAME
IS CALLED,

24:35.348 --> 24:38.184
JUST TAKE A SEAT
ALONGSIDE THAT WALL.

24:38.351 --> 24:39.852
REVEREND ALDEN.

24:41.771 --> 24:43.272
MR. OLESON.

24:43.440 --> 24:45.941
DR. BAKER.

24:47.777 --> 24:50.029
FRED SIMMONS.

24:51.448 --> 24:52.948
STEVE MASON.

24:53.116 --> 24:56.118
JUDGE! THEM MEN
IS ALL PREJUDICED
AGIN' ME.

24:56.286 --> 24:58.120
THAT'S JUST
AN OPINION,
MR. LARRABEE,

24:58.288 --> 25:00.498
AND I'M AFRAID
YOU'VE GOT
NO CHOICE.

25:00.665 --> 25:01.749
WE NEED A JURY.

25:01.917 --> 25:03.626
WHY DON'T HE GET MATT
THERE ON THE JURY?

25:03.793 --> 25:06.128
HE WON'T GET MATT
BECAUSE HE KNOWS
MATT'S A FRIEND OF MINE.

25:06.296 --> 25:08.797
I WAS JUST ABOUT
TO NAME MATT GILLIS,
YOUR HONOR.

25:10.050 --> 25:12.593
DOES THAT
SATISFY YOU,
MR. LARRABEE?

25:15.597 --> 25:17.973
YOU MAY CONTINUE,
MR. INGALLS.

25:18.141 --> 25:19.600
MATT.

25:27.567 --> 25:29.151
JOE KAGAN.

25:30.654 --> 25:33.614
JUDGE! HE CAN'T
NAME KAGAN TO THAT JURY!

25:33.782 --> 25:37.368
WILL YOU STATE YOUR
REASON FOR OBJECTING
TO MR. KAGAN?

25:37.536 --> 25:40.162
BECAUSE IT'S AGIN' THE LAW
TO HAVE A COLORED ON A JURY,
THAT'S WHY.

25:40.330 --> 25:44.250
YOU'RE OBJECTING
TO HIS RACE.
AM I CORRECT?

25:44.417 --> 25:45.501
YOU BET I AM.

25:45.669 --> 25:48.170
THEN I MUST INFORM
YOU AND THE COURT

25:48.338 --> 25:51.257
THAT IT HAS RECENTLY
BEEN DECLARED
UNCONSTITUTIONAL

25:51.424 --> 25:53.842
TO BAR A MEMBER
OF THE NEGRO RACE

25:54.010 --> 25:56.637
FROM SITTING
IN JUDGMENT ON
A WHITE DEFENDANT.

25:56.805 --> 25:59.348
THEREFORE,
MR. LARRABEE'S
OBJECTION

25:59.516 --> 26:01.308
IS OVERRULED.

26:01.476 --> 26:04.353
TAKE YOUR PLACE,
MR. KAGAN.

26:04.521 --> 26:06.272
THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.

26:15.699 --> 26:18.576
Charles: JEFF HARMON.

26:18.743 --> 26:21.203
HARRY ROSS.

26:21.371 --> 26:23.872
TOM O'FARRELL.

26:26.209 --> 26:28.085
MIKE DUBBINS.

26:37.804 --> 26:40.139
Judge:
AND IT WAS BECAUSE

26:40.307 --> 26:44.143
YOU FELT CHEATED
BY MR. LARRABEE

26:44.311 --> 26:48.480
THAT YOU WENT
TO CONFRONT HIM
AT HIS HOME.

26:48.648 --> 26:50.941
THE WHOLE TOWN WAS CHEATED
BY WHAT HE'D DONE.

26:51.109 --> 26:54.153
YET YOU WERE
THE ONLY ONE
TO CONFRONT HIM.

26:54.321 --> 26:57.948
I WAS THE FIRST.
I THINK THERE WOULD
HAVE BEEN OTHERS,

26:58.116 --> 27:01.160
BUT WORD GOT AROUND
THAT I'D ALREADY
SPOKE MY PIECE.

27:01.328 --> 27:04.580
SEE, ME AND HIM
HAVE HAD OUR TROUBLES
BEFORE, YOUR HONOR.

27:04.748 --> 27:06.624
YOU WERE ABUSIVE
TO HIM, THEN.

27:06.791 --> 27:08.083
YOU COULD SAY.

27:08.251 --> 27:11.337
IN FRONT
OF MY WHOLE FAMILY,
HE TRIED TO SHAME ME!

27:11.504 --> 27:12.963
I TOLD YOU THEY SHOULDN'T
HAVE BEEN THERE!

27:13.131 --> 27:15.382
MY FAMILY'S GOT
A RIGHT TO BE
IN THEIR OWN HOUSE!

27:15.550 --> 27:18.469
WE WILL HAVE AN
ORDERLY PROCEEDING
OR NONE AT ALL.

27:19.971 --> 27:23.349
I'M ESTABLISHING
THAT THE DEFENDANT
HAD SUFFICIENT CAUSE

27:23.516 --> 27:26.685
TO SEEK REVENGE
AGAINST MR. GARVEY.

27:26.853 --> 27:30.689
WHETHER HE DID
IN FACT DO SO IN
THE MANNER CHARGED

27:30.857 --> 27:33.484
IS WHAT WE ARE HERE
TO FIND OUT.

27:34.486 --> 27:37.488
DO YOU WISH
TO QUESTION
THE WITNESS?

27:40.617 --> 27:42.076
I GOT NOTHING
TO SAY TO HIM,

27:42.243 --> 27:43.410
NOW OR EVER.

27:43.578 --> 27:47.373
YOU MAY STEP DOWN,
MR. GARVEY.

27:48.625 --> 27:49.833
NEXT WITNESS.

27:50.752 --> 27:53.045
WHEN MR. LARRABEE

27:53.213 --> 27:55.089
ARRIVED
AT YOUR HOUSE,

27:55.256 --> 27:57.132
WERE YOU ALONE?

27:57.300 --> 27:59.051
Andy: YES, SIR.

27:59.219 --> 28:01.470
HIS MANNER
FRIGHTENED YOU.

28:01.638 --> 28:03.347
IT SURE DID.

28:03.515 --> 28:07.309
HE WAS HOLLERING
AND WAVING A SHOTGUN AND--

28:07.477 --> 28:11.313
NOW, THIS IS
A VERY IMPORTANT
QUESTION, ANDREW.

28:11.481 --> 28:14.942
WHEN MR. LARRABEE
THREW YOU
TO THE FLOOR,

28:15.110 --> 28:19.446
DO YOU BELIEVE
HE WAS DELIBERATELY
TRYING TO HURT YOU?

28:19.614 --> 28:22.491
YOU MEAN,
WAS IT AN ACCIDENT?

28:22.659 --> 28:24.535
DO YOU FEEL
IT WAS?

28:24.703 --> 28:26.078
NO, SIR.

28:26.246 --> 28:27.371
JUDGE, CAN'T YOU--

28:27.539 --> 28:31.041
YOU'LL HAVE
YOUR TURN,
MR. LARRABEE.

28:31.209 --> 28:33.419
WHEN YOU REGAINED
CONSCIOUSNESS,

28:33.586 --> 28:36.714
DID YOU SEE
MR. LARRABEE AGAIN?

28:36.881 --> 28:38.841
NO, SIR.

28:39.008 --> 28:43.512
WHEN YOU LEFT

FOR YOUR PARENTS,

28:43.680 --> 28:45.556
DID YOU SEE
ANYBODY?

28:45.724 --> 28:47.015
NO, SIR.

28:47.183 --> 28:49.059
IT WAS AWFUL DARK.

28:49.227 --> 28:51.520
I COULD HARDLY
SEE ANYTHING.

28:51.688 --> 28:53.105
VERY WELL.

28:54.858 --> 28:56.483
YOU MAY QUESTION.

29:02.574 --> 29:05.492
N-NOW, BOY,
I'LL ADMIT I WAS RILED,

29:05.660 --> 29:08.704
AND I'LL ADMIT
I PUSHED YOU AROUND,

29:08.872 --> 29:11.039
BUT I DIDN'T MEAN YOU
NO HARM.

29:11.207 --> 29:14.293
CAN'T YOU SEE
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT?

29:14.461 --> 29:15.878
NO, I CAN'T.

29:16.045 --> 29:18.672

MAKE HIM SEE IT WAS
AN ACCIDENT?

29:22.218 --> 29:24.261
DO YOU HAVE
ANY MORE QUESTIONS?

29:27.474 --> 29:28.891
I RECKON NOT.

29:29.058 --> 29:31.852
STEP DOWN, PLEASE.

29:32.020 --> 29:33.479
YES, SIR.

29:36.065 --> 29:40.444
MR. LARRABEE,
WHEN YOU SAY
THAT MR. GARVEY

29:40.612 --> 29:44.406
CAUSED YOU
TO SEEK REVENGE
AGAINST HIM...

29:44.574 --> 29:47.493
WOULD YOU ALSO SAY
THAT MR. GARVEY
HIMSELF

29:47.660 --> 29:50.579
HAD CAUSE TO BE
ANGRY WITH YOU?

29:50.747 --> 29:53.332
Mr. Larrabee:
YEAH. I RECKON
HE THOUGHT HE HAD.

29:53.500 --> 29:55.167
WOULD YOU SAY
THAT OTHERS

29:55.335 --> 29:57.085
HAD CAUSE TO BE
ANGRY WITH YOU?

29:57.253 --> 29:58.837
OTHERS GOT A RIGHT
TO THINK THE WAY
THEY WANT TO.

29:59.005 --> 30:00.422
YOU DID AGREE
TO HOLD

30:00.590 --> 30:03.592
TO THE WHEAT PRICE,
DIDN'T YOU?

30:03.760 --> 30:05.260
ANSWER THE QUESTION!

30:05.428 --> 30:06.929
YES, I DID!

30:08.389 --> 30:10.599
AND THEN
YOU BROKE YOUR WORD.

30:10.767 --> 30:13.101
IT WAS
IN MY BEST INTERESTS.

30:13.269 --> 30:17.105
WAS IT? EVEN
WITH THE SELLING
OF THE APPLE CROP,

30:17.273 --> 30:19.066
YOU DIDN'T MAKE
AS MUCH

30:19.234 --> 30:22.152
AS IF YOU'D STUCK
TO THE ORIGINAL
PRICE.

30:22.320 --> 30:25.072
NOW, HOW WAS THAT
IN YOUR BEST
INTERESTS?

30:25.240 --> 30:29.451
BECAUSE THAT BUYER
MIGHT HAVE TOLD US ALL
TO GO JUMP IN THE CREEK

30:29.619 --> 30:30.786

SOMEWHERES ELSE!

30:30.954 --> 30:33.789

TO THINK SO.

30:33.957 --> 30:37.751
WELL, NOBODY ELSE
HAD AS MUCH TO LOSE.

30:37.919 --> 30:40.796
WOULD YOU SAY
THAT THERE WAS
ANOTHER REASON

30:40.964 --> 30:43.882
WHY YOU CHOSE
TO BREAK YOUR WORD?

30:44.050 --> 30:47.010
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
THAT QUESTION.

30:47.178 --> 30:50.138
WELL, MR. GARVEY
HAS TESTIFIED

30:50.306 --> 30:52.474
THAT YOU DIDN'T LIKE
THE IDEA

30:52.642 --> 30:56.478
THAT MR. KAGAN WOULD
MAKE THE SAME PROFIT
AS YOU.

30:56.646 --> 30:59.857

AND HE GOT HIMSELF
WIPED OUT, TOO.

TO MAKE A STATEMENT
ON YOUR OWN BEHALF?

THAT BOY,

31:28.678 --> 31:29.803

31:29.971 --> 31:32.180
BUT I NEVER
BURNED DOWN NO BARN!

31:32.348 --> 31:34.016
I THINK GARVEY
DONE IT HISSELF.

31:34.183 --> 31:37.936
HE EVEN SAID
HE'D RATHER BURN HIS CROP
THAN SELL IT AT THAT PRICE,

31:38.104 --> 31:39.521
AND I THINK THAT'S
EXACTLY WHAT HE DONE,

31:39.689 --> 31:41.189
AND I THINK HE'S TRYING
TO BLAME IT ON ME,

BECAUSE I CAN'T ERASE

42:33.425 --> 42:35.552
THOSE PICTURES
FROM MY BRAIN.

42:42.351 --> 42:47.647
I KNOW WHAT CAN HAPPEN
WHEN JUSTICE DISAPPEARS,

42:47.815 --> 42:51.568
AND I WILL BRING HARM
TO NO MAN

42:51.735 --> 42:55.738
WHEN HIS GUILT AIN'T
BEEN PROVED IN MY EYES.

43:07.835 --> 43:10.295
MR. KAGAN, YOU MAY
TAKE YOUR PLACE

43:10.462 --> 43:12.922
AMONG
THE SPECTATORS.

43:25.894 --> 43:28.062
Judge:
MR. INGALLS,

43:28.230 --> 43:31.190
SELECT
ANOTHER JUROR,
PLEASE.

43:32.526 --> 43:33.985
Charles: RAY BICKELL.

43:34.153 --> 43:35.653
TAKE YOUR PLACE.

43:42.036 --> 43:45.288
SINCE
WE ALREADY HAVE
11 GUILTY VERDICTS,

43:45.456 --> 43:46.914
IT WOULD SAVE TIME
AND TROUBLE

43:47.082 --> 43:48.833
IF YOU
SIMPLY ANNOUNCED
WHAT YOURS IS,

43:49.001 --> 43:52.045
AND PERHAPS
WE CAN CONCLUDE
THESE PROCEEDINGS.

43:52.212 --> 43:54.005
Andy: NO.

43:54.173 --> 43:56.007
PLEASE, YOU CAN'T.

43:57.551 --> 44:01.387
PLEASE, JUDGE.
THERE'S SOMETHING
I DIDN'T TELL YOU.

44:01.555 --> 44:03.014
[PEOPLE MUTTERING]

44:03.182 --> 44:06.684
I'M SORRY.
I--I THOUGHT I WAS
DOING THE RIGHT THING.

44:06.852 --> 44:08.519
YOUNG MAN, ANYTHING
YOU HAVE TO SAY

44:08.687 --> 44:11.939
MUST BE CONSIDERED
IRRELEVANT...

44:12.107 --> 44:16.235
UNLESS YOU...LIED
IN YOUR TESTIMONY.

44:16.403 --> 44:18.738
NO, SIR.
I--I DIDN'T LIE.

44:18.906 --> 44:22.617
MR. LARRABEE--HE COULD
HAVE SET THE FIRE.

44:22.785 --> 44:25.953
I'M NOT SAYING
THAT HE COULDN'T HAVE
COME BACK AND DONE IT.

44:26.121 --> 44:28.122
I'M...

44:28.290 --> 44:30.625
THEN WHAT
ARE YOU SAYING?

44:32.086 --> 44:34.504
IT COULD
HAVE BEEN ME, TOO.

44:34.672 --> 44:36.964
[PEOPLE MUTTERING]

44:38.550 --> 44:40.760
IT WAS DARK THAT NIGHT.

44:40.928 --> 44:44.555
IT WAS SO DARK,
I COULDN'T EVEN SEE MY WAY
TO GET TO THE CORRAL,

44:44.723 --> 44:46.474
SO I TOOK A LANTERN
OUT WITH ME,

44:46.642 --> 44:49.560
AND I HUNG IT UP
ON THE FENCE WHILE
I GOT MY HORSE READY.

44:49.728 --> 44:53.147
THE WIND WAS BLOWING
SOMETHING FEARFUL, TOO,

44:53.315 --> 44:56.567
AND I WANTED TO GET
TO MY FOLKS SO BAD,
I JUST FORGOT ABOUT IT.

44:56.735 --> 44:59.946
THE WIND COULD HAVE
BLOWN IT OFF THE FENCE.

45:00.114 --> 45:02.740
JUDGE, THAT'S THE WAY
IT MUST HAVE HAPPENED!

45:04.743 --> 45:06.744
DID YOU EVER FIND
THE LANTERN?

45:06.912 --> 45:10.581
YES, SIR. STILL LAYING
THERE IN THE ASHES.

45:10.749 --> 45:13.584
I WANTED TO BE SURE
HE WAS PUNISHED

45:13.752 --> 45:16.671
FOR WHAT HE DID
TO ME AND MY FOLKS

45:16.839 --> 45:18.965
AND THE WHOLE TOWN...

45:22.344 --> 45:25.138
BUT I CAN'T.

45:25.305 --> 45:26.848
I MEAN...

45:27.015 --> 45:29.642
NOT WHAT AFTER
MR. KAGAN SAID.

45:33.439 --> 45:35.481
TAKE YOUR SEAT, SON.

45:40.362 --> 45:43.322
WILL THE DEFENDANT
PLEASE RISE?

45:46.869 --> 45:48.453
JUDD LARRABEE,

45:48.620 --> 45:51.539
YOU'VE BEEN FOUND
GUILTY OF ASSAULT
AND BATTERY.

45:51.707 --> 45:54.459
AS FOR THE CHARGE
OF BARN-BURNING,

45:54.626 --> 45:57.462
SOME REASONABLE
DOUBT EXISTS
AS TO ITS VALIDITY,

45:57.629 --> 46:00.715
AND YOU WILL
RECEIVE THE BENEFIT
OF THAT DOUBT.

46:00.883 --> 46:02.341
THANK YOU.

46:04.094 --> 46:05.762
I COULD EASILY
SEND YOU TO PRISON

46:05.929 --> 46:08.890
FOR A VERY LONG
TIME,

46:09.057 --> 46:13.060
BUT THAT WOULD SERVE
NO USEFUL PURPOSE
TO THIS COMMUNITY,

46:13.228 --> 46:15.897
TO WHICH YOU OWE
SO MUCH.

46:16.064 --> 46:20.067
I THEREFORE
SENTENCE YOU TO PAY
JONATHAN GARVEY

46:20.235 --> 46:22.987
AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO
HIS DESTROYED CROP,

46:23.155 --> 46:26.282
HAD HE SOLD IT
AT THE ORIGINAL
AGREED-ON PRICE.

46:26.450 --> 46:28.159
JUDGE, THAT AIN'T FAIR!

46:28.327 --> 46:35.416
I WOULD ADVISE YOU
NOT TO USE THE WORD
"FAIR"!

46:37.836 --> 46:41.506
MY SENTENCE MIGHT
CHANGE RAPIDLY.

46:41.673 --> 46:47.094
NOW, DO YOU
WISH TO ANNOUNCE
ANY MORE OBJECTIONS?

46:52.768 --> 46:54.644
I WILL RETURN
IN EXACTLY TWO WEEKS

46:54.812 --> 46:57.271
TO CONFIRM
THAT THE TERMS
OF THIS SENTENCE

46:57.439 --> 46:58.940
ARE CARRIED OUT
TO THE LETTER.

46:59.107 --> 47:00.399
IS THAT UNDERSTOOD?

47:00.567 --> 47:01.984
YES, SIR.

47:02.152 --> 47:04.278
COURT IS ADJOURNED.

47:47.573 --> 47:51.200
I DIDN'T NEED NO NIGGER
DEFENDING ME!

47:59.793 --> 48:02.086
I DIDN'T NEED NOBODY!
YOU UNDERSTAND?

48:02.254 --> 48:04.213
I DIDN'T NEED NOBODY!
