00:05.359 --> 00:06.893
Antonio!

00:06.895 --> 00:07.960
Ahh!

00:07.962 --> 00:11.731
My friend, it's time
for you to rest now.

00:11.733 --> 00:13.065
I'll be honest with you, Victor.

00:13.067 --> 00:14.934
I hate the thought of letting you out.

00:14.936 --> 00:16.936
Zachary Cain.

00:16.938 --> 00:18.004
Victor Olson.

00:18.006 --> 00:20.072
Amber: You are living the life I want.

00:20.074 --> 00:22.741
I could be with Cain,
and no one would hunt me.

00:22.743 --> 00:25.210
- You asked him to bite you.
- He won't do it.

00:25.212 --> 00:26.678
He's afraid of losing me.

00:26.680 --> 00:29.074
The ones that try to fight
back are the most fun.

00:29.090 --> 00:31.023
Hmm. (Cracking)
(Grunting)

00:31.025 --> 00:34.059
Cain fell in love with
a girl so much so,

00:34.061 --> 00:36.461
no matter how much she
asked him to bite her,

00:36.463 --> 00:39.130
he can't do it because
he's afraid of losing her!

00:39.132 --> 00:41.032
That's love.

00:41.034 --> 00:43.268
- Tell me where they're hiding.
- I can't. You'll kill her.

00:43.270 --> 00:44.969
I'll find her in the night
and I'll bite her.

00:44.971 --> 00:46.938
- No, it's Santos.
- Tell me where they're hiding.

00:46.940 --> 00:49.474
It's Jimmy Koenig. He's
coming real soon, Clay.

00:49.476 --> 00:52.543
(Groaning)
Oh, my God!

00:52.545 --> 00:54.045
For killing Pete,

00:54.047 --> 00:55.880
you will never be forgiven.

00:55.882 --> 00:58.049
(Screaming)

00:58.051 --> 00:59.450
Clay: Santos hired Jimmy Koenig.

00:59.452 --> 01:01.485
- He's coming for us.
- Why do I know that name?

01:01.487 --> 01:03.054
He was the Pack enforcer.

01:03.056 --> 01:05.123
My father used to call
him the killing machine.

01:05.125 --> 01:06.724
You can hate me for biting you,

01:06.726 --> 01:08.492
but how we got here doesn't matter.

01:08.494 --> 01:11.161
What we have between us is
the real thing or it's not.

01:11.163 --> 01:13.364

01:25.177 --> 01:27.177
We were unprepared
when Santos and LeBlanc

01:27.179 --> 01:28.779
attacked us on the road.

01:28.781 --> 01:30.113
They caught us off guard.

01:30.115 --> 01:31.614
Your father paid the price.

01:31.616 --> 01:33.616
We won't be caught off guard this time.

01:33.618 --> 01:35.551
(Grunts)
Nick,

01:35.553 --> 01:37.921
you're letting your emotions control you.

01:37.923 --> 01:40.123
You're leaving your left flank exposed.

01:40.125 --> 01:41.624
That leaves you vulnerable.

01:41.626 --> 01:43.826
(Grunt)
To a counter-attack.

01:43.828 --> 01:45.928
(Groan)
Listen to me.

01:45.930 --> 01:48.264
Look at me.

01:48.266 --> 01:50.733
Self-control is everything.

01:52.135 --> 01:54.036
Did you pick the place or did Koenig?

01:54.038 --> 01:56.406
It was mutually agreed-upon.

01:56.408 --> 01:58.140
Did you ever fight him in the past?

01:58.142 --> 02:00.309
No, I've never fought anyone
from the Pack before.

02:00.311 --> 02:02.544
Except my father.

02:02.546 --> 02:04.180
Jimmy Koenig was an enforcer.

02:04.182 --> 02:05.547
He always did business for the Pack,

02:05.549 --> 02:07.116
never against us, until now.

02:07.118 --> 02:09.985
Well, you'll take him out.

02:09.987 --> 02:11.420
He won't know what hit him.

02:11.422 --> 02:13.289
Don't underestimate Jimmy Koenig

02:13.291 --> 02:15.256
or his brutality.

02:15.258 --> 02:16.891
Your father made that mistake once

02:16.893 --> 02:19.594
and he regretted it
the rest of his life.

02:19.596 --> 02:21.896
Jeremy: <i>You were barely six months old</i>

02:21.898 --> 02:24.933
<i>and I was supposed to bring you
and Antonio back into the Pack.</i>

02:24.935 --> 02:26.868
<i>But on that day I was</i>
<i>told to stand down.</i>

02:26.870 --> 02:30.071
<i>None of us knew,</i>
<i>but your grandfather, Dominic,</i>

02:30.073 --> 02:33.308
<i>had sent Jimmy Koenig instead.</i>

02:33.310 --> 02:35.409
I thought Jeremy was going
to bring back me and Nick.

02:37.479 --> 02:39.647
You thought wrong, Antonio.

02:39.649 --> 02:41.950
Look, Jimmy, I made a mistake leaving

02:41.952 --> 02:44.152
to raise Nick with his mother.

02:44.154 --> 02:46.354
I had my first Change.

02:46.356 --> 02:48.556
It scared the hell out of me.

02:48.558 --> 02:51.759
I understand now why we have the rules.

02:51.761 --> 02:53.927
Sons need to be raised

02:53.929 --> 02:55.596
with their own, by the Pack.

02:55.598 --> 02:58.399
So, I'm doing the right thing now.

02:58.401 --> 02:59.867
Look, I'm coming back.

03:01.737 --> 03:03.803
(Clearing throat)

03:03.805 --> 03:06.340
Okay...

03:06.342 --> 03:09.243
if you're going to kill
me, just do it quick.

03:09.245 --> 03:12.346
And take my son to Jeremy.

03:13.781 --> 03:15.949
(Laugh)

03:20.522 --> 03:21.954
You're a Sorrentino.

03:24.259 --> 03:26.259
Dominic's got a job for you.

03:26.261 --> 03:29.295
Part of the deal for
coming back to the Pack.

03:29.297 --> 03:31.264
A couple of Mutts that went astray.

03:31.266 --> 03:33.232
(Exhaling sharply)

03:33.234 --> 03:35.334
- What did they do?
- Doesn't matter.

04:40.366 --> 04:42.699
A few years after Antonio came back,

I asked Dominic about the man

04:44.403 --> 04:46.870
your father had to kill and bury.

04:46.872 --> 04:49.506
Dominic had no idea
what I was talking about.

04:49.508 --> 04:51.108
That wasn't his order.

04:51.110 --> 04:53.877
It was Koenig.

04:53.879 --> 04:56.246
He forced your father to kill a man,

04:56.248 --> 04:58.782
just for the sport of it.

04:58.784 --> 05:01.918
Koenig is a very strong fighter,

05:01.920 --> 05:03.653
but in the moment right before the kill,

05:03.655 --> 05:06.122
he blocks everything else out

05:06.124 --> 05:07.757
so that he can savour the second

05:07.759 --> 05:09.593
that he takes his victim's life.

Still recovering,

No, you do it for fun.

08:42.875 --> 08:45.609

No Mutt walks in there
