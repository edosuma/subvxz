WEBVTT

00:00.758 --> 00:01.737
There are two kinds of folks

00:01.764 --> 00:03.364
who sit around thinking
about how to kill people:

00:03.698 --> 00:05.424
psychopaths
and mystery writers.

00:05.762 --> 00:06.784
I'm the kind that pays better.

00:06.885 --> 00:07.585
Who am I?

00:07.674 --> 00:08.813
I'm Rick Castle.

00:08.814 --> 00:09.214
Castle.

00:09.248 --> 00:09.908
Castle.

00:09.909 --> 00:11.909
I really am ruggedly handsome,
aren't I?

00:12.155 --> 00:14.345
Every writer needs  inspiration.
And I found mine.

00:14.455 --> 00:15.274
Detective Kate Beckett.

00:15.309 --> 00:16.329
- Beckett.
- Beckett.

00:16.364 --> 00:18.270
- Nikki Heat?
- The character he's basing on you.

00:18.316 --> 00:19.802
And thanks to my friendship
with the mayor,

00:19.803 --> 00:20.803
I get to be on her case.

00:20.837 --> 00:22.780
I would be happy
to let you spank me.

00:22.815 --> 00:23.691
And together, we catch killers

00:24.639 --> 00:25.627
We make a pretty
good team, you know?

00:25.728 --> 00:26.728
Like Starsky and Hutch.

00:26.862 --> 00:27.556
Turner and Hooch.

00:27.657 --> 00:29.257
You do remind me
a little of Hooch.

00:29.862 --> 00:30.927
Sophie!

00:30.962 --> 00:32.916
Sophie,
are you in there?

00:32.950 --> 00:35.767
Sophie, the procession starts
in 15 minutes.

00:35.802 --> 00:37.127
If that girl ruins
your wedding--

00:37.128 --> 00:38.828
I'm not worried about
the wedding, mother.

00:39.162 --> 00:40.588
I'm worried about sophie.

00:40.622 --> 00:43.252
If I had as much champagne
as she did last night,

00:43.287 --> 00:45.417
I'd probably be late
for February.

00:45.418 --> 00:46.418
Oh, hey.

00:46.451 --> 00:49.178
Can you open this door for us?
It's an emergency. Please.

00:49.212 --> 00:51.177
Thank you.

00:51.211 --> 00:54.237
♪ ah, it's a crying... ♪

00:54.271 --> 00:56.028
Sophie.

00:56.062 --> 00:57.552
Sophie.

00:57.587 --> 00:59.668
The bed
hasn't been slept in.

00:59.703 --> 01:03.058
♪ it's a crying shame
that the love feels lame ♪

01:03.093 --> 01:04.589
She's not in the bathroom.

01:04.623 --> 01:07.619
Go and see
if her dress is still here.

01:07.654 --> 01:10.317
♪ the love... ♪

01:10.352 --> 01:11.817
Aah!

01:13.981 --> 01:16.146
Make sure it's nice and tight.

01:16.181 --> 01:17.644
Yes, sir.

01:17.679 --> 01:20.110
What on earth
are you two doing?

01:20.145 --> 01:21.042
Research.

01:21.043 --> 01:23.143
Dad has Nikki Heat
duct-taped to a chair

01:23.176 --> 01:24.175
in his next chapter,

01:24.209 --> 01:25.606
and he doesn't know
how to get her out of it.

01:25.641 --> 01:27.140
I thought, what better way
to figure it out

01:27.174 --> 01:28.939
than to get into the mind
of my character.

01:29.040 --> 01:29.840
I don't know.

01:29.874 --> 01:32.505
I suppose you could just use
your imagination.

01:32.706 --> 01:35.006
Well, I want it
to be authentic. Hands.

01:35.007 --> 01:36.007
Mm.

01:36.539 --> 01:38.337
Well, hurry taping up
your father.

01:38.371 --> 01:40.738
We don't want to be late.

01:40.772 --> 01:42.037
Oh, God. I can't believe
I just said that.

01:42.038 --> 01:43.038
Where are you two off to?

01:43.572 --> 01:45.436
Gram's got a dress rehearsal.
I thought I'd go watch.

01:45.437 --> 01:46.137
Watch me

01:46.270 --> 01:48.335
or watch the adorable
delivery boy in the second act?

01:50.370 --> 01:51.536
Too tight?

01:51.937 --> 01:53.137
Perfect.

01:52.970 --> 01:54.536
And you're sure
about your mouth?

01:54.770 --> 01:58.436
Like I said, authentic.

01:59.070 --> 02:00.203
Mm.

02:00.837 --> 02:02.104
Nod if you're okay.

02:02.172 --> 02:05.105
Okay. We're off, and after,
we might go shopping.

02:05.140 --> 02:07.073
So...

02:07.107 --> 02:09.969
You don't mind, right?

02:10.002 --> 02:11.734
Mm.
Oh, come on, dad.

02:11.769 --> 02:13.302
We both know you'd have
no respect for me if I didn't.

02:13.536 --> 02:14.935
Have fun
and good luck.

02:16.670 --> 02:19.635
I don't know where she gets
it from. Honestly, I don't.

02:20.270 --> 02:22.303
Bye.
Adios.

02:23.671 --> 02:26.502

02:37.672 --> 02:39.339
mm.

02:39.373 --> 02:41.239
Mm. Oh!

02:43.241 --> 02:44.641
Victim is Sophie Ronson, 35.

02:44.676 --> 02:46.509
She's in from LA
for the wedding.

02:46.510 --> 02:47.510
Was she a guest?

02:47.443 --> 02:48.977
Mnh-mnh. Bridesmaid.

02:51.378 --> 02:52.711
The bride came looking

02:52.746 --> 02:55.179
when Ms. Ronson didn't show up
for her hair and makeup.

02:55.314 --> 02:58.281
Found her
stuffed in that armoire.

02:58.716 --> 02:59.982
What do you see?

02:59.983 --> 03:02.083
Preliminary cause
is asphyxiation.

03:02.117 --> 03:04.051
And from the way
her windpipe is crushed,

03:04.085 --> 03:05.687
I'd say the killer
choked her from behind.

03:06.721 --> 03:08.289
We've got contusions
on her throat,

03:08.323 --> 03:09.924
one of her earrings
is missing.

03:10.558 --> 03:12.759
It looks like it was yanked
from her lobe.

03:12.793 --> 03:15.394
We searched the room.
The earring's not here.

03:15.395 --> 03:17.095
Get CSU
to print out a picture

03:17.129 --> 03:18.429
so that uniforms can start
searching the hotel.

03:18.430 --> 03:19.430
Yeah.

03:20.164 --> 03:21.130
Time of death?

03:21.131 --> 03:23.031
Based on temperature
and lividity,

03:23.165 --> 03:25.330
I'd say between 3:00
and 5:00 am this morning.

03:25.364 --> 03:27.263
- Thank you.
- Hmm.

03:27.297 --> 03:28.830
Let's talk
to hotel security.

03:28.864 --> 03:29.797
I want to see
surveillance tapes

03:29.899 --> 03:31.632
and a list of all
registered hotel guests.

03:31.633 --> 03:33.633
And get records for her
room phone and her cell.

03:33.634 --> 03:34.634
- I'm on it.
- Uh-huh.

03:35.066 --> 03:37.267
Hotel says only one key card
was issued to the victim.

03:37.301 --> 03:39.602
It was last used to enter
the victim's room at 3:18 am.

03:39.603 --> 03:41.403
Okay, well, that coincides
with time of death.

03:41.636 --> 03:42.937
Where are the bride and groom?

03:42.938 --> 03:44.138
Bridal suite
at the end of the hall.

03:44.171 --> 03:46.138
Uh, Greg Andyra.

03:46.139 --> 03:48.139
Okay, have uniforms assemble
the wedding guests

03:48.173 --> 03:49.141
in the bar to be interviewed.

03:49.142 --> 03:50.142
Where's Castle?

03:50.143 --> 03:52.043
I don't know. Figured
the death of a bridesmaid

03:52.076 --> 03:53.143
would be right up his alley.

03:53.144 --> 03:55.244
He heard "wedding"
and probably got cold feet?

03:56.745 --> 03:57.845
Hmm.

04:05.751 --> 04:07.117
Huh.

04:09.486 --> 04:11.488
Attaboy, Rick.

04:11.522 --> 04:13.688
Huh.

04:16.524 --> 04:18.957
When was the last time
that you saw Sophie?

04:18.992 --> 04:20.958
At the rehearsal dinner
last night.

04:21.791 --> 04:23.092
I don't even think
I talked to her.

04:24.127 --> 04:25.326
She came all this way
for us,

04:25.361 --> 04:27.195
and I don't think
I even said hello.

04:27.229 --> 04:30.530
It's not your fault, Kyra.
It was a crazy day.

04:30.565 --> 04:33.099
Did you talk to her
after I went up to bed?

04:33.134 --> 04:35.468
No. You know
how uncle Teddy is.

04:35.503 --> 04:37.503
He wouldn't let me leave
without doing tequila shots.

04:38.238 --> 04:40.038
I escaped up to my room
around 1:00.

04:40.573 --> 04:42.373
I'm not sure if Sophie
was still at the bar.

04:42.808 --> 04:44.142
The two of you weren't
in the same room last night?

04:44.443 --> 04:45.443
No.

04:45.676 --> 04:47.943
It's bad luck to see the bride
before the wedding.

04:49.944 --> 04:51.844
Is there anything else
you can tell me about Sophie?

04:52.347 --> 04:54.850
Was she in a relationship?
Did she have any enemies?

04:54.884 --> 04:56.319
I don't know.

04:56.353 --> 05:00.292
She lived in LA, and we--
we were never super close.

05:00.326 --> 05:01.630
Sophie introduced us.

05:02.031 --> 05:03.431
She's the reason we're together.

05:03.432 --> 05:05.332
So when we were planning
the wedding,

05:05.364 --> 05:06.898
we thought
she should be there.

05:06.933 --> 05:09.200
But the engagement party was
the first time we'd seen her

05:09.235 --> 05:12.437
in a couple of years,
and now she's dead.

05:12.472 --> 05:14.940
Who would do
something like this?

05:14.974 --> 05:17.309
That's what we're here
to find out.

05:17.343 --> 05:18.777
Here you go.

05:18.811 --> 05:20.379
Thanks, Joe. That's great.

05:20.413 --> 05:21.747
Hotel security?

05:21.781 --> 05:23.782
Yeah. They do background checks
on all their employees.

05:23.817 --> 05:26.185
seemed pretty sure there wasn't
a killer among them,

05:26.219 --> 05:28.253
but he gave me the list.

05:28.288 --> 05:29.688
He's also pulling
the surveillance tapes.

05:29.722 --> 05:32.291
Good news is, the elevators are
all wired. Bad news is,

05:32.325 --> 05:33.860
the stairwells
and hallways aren't.

05:35.495 --> 05:36.764
Oh, look who it is.

05:36.765 --> 05:38.665
We were about to send out
a search party. Where you been?

05:38.698 --> 05:40.966
Uh, I got a little tied up with work.
Hmm.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.335
-Which way to the crime scene?
- Sixth floor.

05:43.369 --> 05:44.970
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm. Hey.

05:45.004 --> 05:47.940
Bro... is that duct tape
on your pants?

05:47.974 --> 05:50.276
Hmm.

05:50.310 --> 05:53.612
Yes. Yes, it is.

05:54.981 --> 05:56.948
So a bridesmaid, huh?

05:56.983 --> 05:58.483
What happened?

05:58.517 --> 06:00.385
Wouldn't get caught
dead in that dress?

06:00.419 --> 06:02.354
they're actually
not that bad.

06:02.388 --> 06:05.556
A subtle mauve chiffon.
Dude, really? Mauve?

06:05.590 --> 06:06.991
What? I have sisters.

06:07.025 --> 06:08.928
You should've seen
their dresses--hideous.

06:08.962 --> 06:10.963
Ah, bridesmaid dresses
are supposed to be hideous.

06:10.964 --> 06:11.964
Really, why?

06:11.998 --> 06:13.931
So that the bride looks
more beautiful in comparison.

06:13.932 --> 06:14.932
Ah, see?

06:14.966 --> 06:17.699
Not a woman alive who doesn't
think about her wedding day,

06:17.733 --> 06:18.901
not even Kate Beckett.

06:18.935 --> 06:20.869
Tell me you never tore
a picture of a wedding gown

06:20.904 --> 06:22.072
out of a magazine.

06:22.373 --> 06:23.773
I've never torn a picture
of a wedding gown

06:23.806 --> 06:24.941
out of a magazine.

06:26.942 --> 06:28.142
You're lying.

06:28.476 --> 06:29.276
- She's lying.
- Mm-hmm.

06:29.310 --> 06:30.977
Mm-hmm.

06:38.152 --> 06:39.586
So who's the unlucky bride?

06:39.620 --> 06:42.455
Uh, her name is...

06:42.490 --> 06:44.591
Kyra?

06:47.928 --> 06:49.529
Rick?

06:52.531 --> 06:54.033
Rick Castle.

06:54.067 --> 06:55.968
You two know each other?

06:56.003 --> 06:58.604
That would be
an understatement.

07:05.871 --> 07:08.071
I read somewhere that you were
working with the police,

07:08.307 --> 07:10.306
But I-I never would've expected to...

07:11.607 --> 07:12.407
How long has it been?

07:12.409 --> 07:16.079
- Too long.
- You look exactly the same.

07:16.113 --> 07:18.281
And you've improved.

07:18.315 --> 07:22.085
You always did know
how to turn a phrase.

07:22.119 --> 07:24.654
This is...

07:24.688 --> 07:26.222
So surreal.

07:26.257 --> 07:27.990
It's my wedding day,

07:28.025 --> 07:30.860
and you... show up.

07:30.894 --> 07:34.630
Castle, Lanie's got something for us.

07:34.665 --> 07:36.632
I'll catch up.

07:36.666 --> 07:39.835
Hmm. Okay.

07:41.872 --> 07:43.207
What'd you find?

07:43.241 --> 07:45.109
Once I turned her over,

07:45.143 --> 07:48.044
I saw these abrasions
across her upper back.

07:48.279 --> 07:50.313
They were definitely made
before she died,

07:50.347 --> 07:51.781
probably during the struggle.

07:51.882 --> 07:53.182
Any idea what made them?

07:53.216 --> 07:55.217
No, but there's an odd shape
to the wounds.

07:55.251 --> 07:57.754
I'll have a better idea once
I get her back to the lab.

07:57.755 --> 07:58.655
Okay.

07:58.689 --> 08:00.657
So how's everything going
in the bridal suite?

08:00.691 --> 08:02.392
Not the day they had planned.

08:02.426 --> 08:04.127
Yeah, or the surprise guest.

08:04.462 --> 08:06.963
Apparently Castle has a history
with the bride.

08:06.997 --> 08:08.564
Ancient, modern or sexual?

08:08.599 --> 08:10.533
Seems like all of the above.

08:10.567 --> 08:12.835
You're okay with that?

08:12.870 --> 08:15.004
Yeah. Why wouldn't I be?

08:15.038 --> 08:17.139
Just keep me posted
on the labs.

08:17.174 --> 08:19.976
Mm-hmm.

08:20.010 --> 08:21.911
So what happened to the girl

08:21.945 --> 08:23.946
who said that marriage
was a Jurassic institution?

08:23.980 --> 08:25.513
She grew up.

08:25.548 --> 08:28.149
Mm. Does that mean the groom
is a grown-up, too?

08:28.183 --> 08:29.784
All work and no play.

08:29.818 --> 08:31.652
No. He plays just enough.

08:31.687 --> 08:33.287
He's a lucky man.

08:34.322 --> 08:35.456
Except today.

08:36.490 --> 08:38.091
All the things

08:38.125 --> 08:40.828
you worry about going wrong
at your wedding...

08:40.861 --> 08:42.496
I'm sorry.

08:42.530 --> 08:44.232
Hey, honey.

08:44.567 --> 08:45.668
Greg.

08:46.002 --> 08:48.636
- This is Rick Castle.
- Rick Castle.

08:48.671 --> 08:51.439
Your ex.

08:51.473 --> 08:54.675
Oh, yes. No--
it's nice to meet you.

08:54.709 --> 08:56.310
Rick's working
with the police now.

08:56.345 --> 08:58.946
Do they think the murderer
is still in the hotel?

08:58.981 --> 09:01.149
Well, that depends on whether
the attack was random

09:01.183 --> 09:03.118
or someone she knew.

09:03.152 --> 09:04.888
So you think one of the guests
could've killed her?

09:04.889 --> 09:06.489
We have to consider
every possibility.

09:06.922 --> 09:08.422
You'll have to excuse us.

09:08.457 --> 09:11.692
-We have people arriving downstairs.
- Of course.

09:17.064 --> 09:19.233
Kyra Blaine.

09:19.267 --> 09:20.501
Wow.

09:22.035 --> 09:24.671
I take it she was
someone very special.

09:25.206 --> 09:27.073
She's the one
that got away.

09:27.608 --> 09:28.509
Could you please tell me
your name

09:28.543 --> 09:30.312
and relationship
to the bride and groom?

09:30.313 --> 09:32.613
Sheila Blaine,
mother of the bride.

09:32.646 --> 09:35.047
Keith Murphy.
I'm the brother of the groom.

09:35.081 --> 09:37.315
Laurie Hill, maid of honor,
friend of the bride.

09:37.350 --> 09:39.417
Ted Murphy,
groom's uncle.

09:39.451 --> 09:42.186
Ruby Osiris-Schwartzman. I was
once married to Kyra's father's

09:42.220 --> 09:43.654
brother's uncle twice removed.

09:43.688 --> 09:46.323
And, boy, was that a mistake.
Is the bar open yet?

09:46.358 --> 09:48.326
Do you have any idea
who might have killed her?

09:48.327 --> 09:49.227
Of course not.

09:49.260 --> 09:50.028
No.

09:50.029 --> 09:50.729
No.

09:50.730 --> 09:51.730
No.

09:51.762 --> 09:53.864
I heard that Sophie almost
didn't come to the wedng.

09:53.898 --> 09:55.866
She called Kyra up
and tried to back out

09:55.900 --> 09:56.868
of being a bridesmaid.

09:56.869 --> 09:58.669
But then she called
and said she changed her mind.

09:58.802 --> 10:00.169
I warned Kyra.

10:00.203 --> 10:03.171
That girl was too unreliable
to be put in a wedding party.

10:03.206 --> 10:04.708
But did she listen to me? No.

10:04.709 --> 10:06.109
Thank you very much. Next!

10:06.143 --> 10:07.644
That's everyone, right?

10:07.678 --> 10:09.112
I think so.

10:09.146 --> 10:12.149
Wait. There's a groomsman
that's not checked off.

10:12.183 --> 10:13.617
Mike Weitz.

10:13.651 --> 10:16.286
Hmm. I didn't talk to him.
You?

10:16.320 --> 10:18.556
No.

10:18.590 --> 10:20.725
Mr. Murphy.

10:20.759 --> 10:22.293
Have you seen Mike Weitz?

10:22.327 --> 10:23.662
No, actually.

10:23.863 --> 10:25.063
Has anybody seen Mike?

10:25.196 --> 10:27.264
Oh, God. He was with Sophie
at the rehearsal dinner.

10:27.298 --> 10:29.833
She's right. I saw them
together in the bar after.

10:29.867 --> 10:32.604
You don't think something
happened to him, too, do you?

10:32.638 --> 10:34.606
None of the guests have seen
Mike since last night.

10:34.640 --> 10:36.641
We checked his room.
The bed's made.

10:36.675 --> 10:38.609
His tux is still hanging
in the closet.

10:38.643 --> 10:40.945
And his key card shows his
last entry at 2:00 am.

10:40.979 --> 10:43.781
2:00 am. All right.
Any signs of foul play?

10:43.815 --> 10:45.551
No, but his toothbrush
and bags are still there.

10:45.552 --> 10:47.652
Have hotel security
start searching the premises.

10:47.686 --> 10:49.254
You think we're gonna find
another body?

10:49.255 --> 10:50.655
More likely,
Mike's our killer,

10:50.689 --> 10:52.957
And he ran off
after strangling Sophie.

10:53.025 --> 10:53.692
So put an A.P.B. out.

10:53.726 --> 10:56.227
Get Mike's photos to all
airports and train stations.

10:56.661 --> 10:58.595
I'll check back with
the wedding guests, see if I can

10:58.630 --> 11:00.499
get a clear picture of Mike
and Sophie's interactions.

11:00.500 --> 11:01.500
Okay, thank you.

11:01.733 --> 11:05.602
Or... we could watch
last night's festivities

11:05.636 --> 11:07.971
for ourselves...

11:08.005 --> 11:11.074
on these handy-dandy
digital video cameras.

11:12.876 --> 11:14.877
<i>There we are, running for
our lives, right...</i>

11:14.912 --> 11:16.880
that's Mike
giving a speech.

11:16.914 --> 11:19.516
and that's sophie
looking away from us.

11:19.551 --> 11:21.852
<i>Serpentined down the hallway.</i>

11:21.886 --> 11:23.750
<i>And that's when--
that's when Keith decides...</i>

11:23.784 --> 11:26.885
<i>he's gonna slow him down
a little bit.</i>

11:26.919 --> 11:28.786
<i>So he grabs
a fire extinguisher...</i>

11:28.821 --> 11:31.620
who takes a call
during a speech?
Right? Rude.

11:31.655 --> 11:33.958
<i>And he's yelling, "I can't see!
I can't see!"</i>

11:33.992 --> 11:36.860
<i>Wonder who she's talking to.
And him and Greg are fall,</i>

11:36.895 --> 11:40.430
<i>And that's when uncle Teddy
shows up to save the day...
Pause that.</i>

11:40.464 --> 11:43.199
<i>In a golf...
Does anyone else find it odd
that Sophie would leave</i>

11:43.233 --> 11:45.034
in the middle
of Mike's speech?

11:45.068 --> 11:46.970
Maybe whoever called
wanted to meet.

11:47.171 --> 11:48.171
Yeah, but who?

11:48.004 --> 11:50.572
Everyone at the rehearsal dinner
is sitting in that room.

11:50.606 --> 11:51.674
Well, according to
the time code,

11:51.708 --> 11:53.775
that call came in
at about 7:41.

11:53.810 --> 11:58.312
Sophie's cell phone history
shows the call came from...

11:58.746 --> 12:00.781
the hotel lobby.

12:01.515 --> 12:02.982
Check with the hotel.

12:03.017 --> 12:05.017
See if they have
any security cameras

12:05.052 --> 12:06.986
covering the phones.

12:08.721 --> 12:10.823
That's perfect. Thanks.

12:14.760 --> 12:16.894
Wait a minute.
I know this guy.

12:16.962 --> 12:18.596
Uh, Gamble.

12:18.630 --> 12:20.763
- Boyd Gamble.
- So he's a dealer?

12:20.798 --> 12:22.862
Mostly weed and coke
back in the day.

12:22.897 --> 12:24.897
Did a couple of years for
assaulting another drug dealer

12:24.932 --> 12:26.765
who was trying to muscle in
on his turf.

12:26.800 --> 12:28.134
Beat him up real bad, too.

12:28.135 --> 12:29.635
Sounds like he's got
a bad temper.

12:29.669 --> 12:31.203
Maybe he's graduated
to murder.

12:32.771 --> 12:35.105
Great. Go pick him up.

12:35.140 --> 12:36.673
Was that about Mike?

12:36.707 --> 12:39.175
Uh, no. Just following up
on a lead.

12:48.483 --> 12:50.717
Your dress is lovely,
by the way.

12:50.752 --> 12:52.619
Oh, thank you so much.

12:52.653 --> 12:54.287
It--it's Kate, right?

12:54.321 --> 12:55.155
Yeah.

12:55.156 --> 12:56.356
I feel like
I know you a little...

12:56.490 --> 12:59.291
- from Nikki Heat, the dedication.
- Oh.

12:59.325 --> 13:01.626
I still read
all of Rick's books.

13:01.661 --> 13:03.562
Yeah, well, most of that book
is just a result

13:03.596 --> 13:05.797
of Castle's
overactive imagination.

13:07.931 --> 13:09.700
It's funny
that you call him that.

13:10.234 --> 13:11.768
Castle.

13:11.802 --> 13:13.736
When I knew him,
he was just Rick,

13:13.771 --> 13:16.305
fresh off
his first best seller.

13:17.807 --> 13:21.243
Well, overactive imagination
or not,

13:21.277 --> 13:23.178
I know he only dedicates
his books...

13:23.212 --> 13:25.946
to people
he really cares for.

13:30.584 --> 13:31.452
<i>Murder?</i>

13:31.486 --> 13:32.413
<i>What, are you nuts?</i>

13:32.456 --> 13:34.656
We know you met Sophie
at the hotel, boyd.

13:34.589 --> 13:36.690
<i>A couple hours later,
she turns up dead.</i>

13:36.725 --> 13:38.194
You want to tell us
how that happened?

13:38.595 --> 13:39.895
She met me in the park.

13:40.628 --> 13:43.063
We had a mutual acquaintance
who recommended my services.

13:43.097 --> 13:44.466
Se knew I could get her
what she needed.

13:44.467 --> 13:46.467
Why didn't you just sell her
the drugs and be done with it?

13:46.500 --> 13:48.135
Why did you show up
at the hotel?

13:48.169 --> 13:50.170
Because she needed
a specialty item.

13:50.204 --> 13:53.006
I didn't have any on me,
so I told her I'd call her when I did.

13:53.174 --> 13:56.209
What specialty item?

13:56.243 --> 13:59.212
Flunitrazepam.

13:59.246 --> 14:00.613
Roofies?

14:00.647 --> 14:02.615
Why would a bridesmaid
need roofies?

14:02.649 --> 14:04.550
You want to take advantage
of a guy,

14:04.585 --> 14:07.086
knocking him unconscious
kind of defeats the purpose.

14:07.154 --> 14:09.055
The best way--just ask.
Oh.

14:09.089 --> 14:10.924
I'll take care of it
for you.

14:11.225 --> 14:12.225
Hello, Sheila.

14:12.159 --> 14:13.194
No problem.

14:13.795 --> 14:14.595
Richard.

14:15.628 --> 14:17.263
Figures you'd be
at the heart of this mess.

14:17.297 --> 14:19.265
Detective Beckett,
this is Sheila Blaine,

14:19.299 --> 14:20.833
mother of the bride.

14:20.867 --> 14:23.102
So I guess I didn't end up
homeless or teaching

14:23.136 --> 14:25.771
at a third-rate college
in New Hampshire after all.

14:25.806 --> 14:27.075
There's still time.

14:27.676 --> 14:29.176
I've missed our special talks.

14:30.309 --> 14:32.610
Sheila didn't approve
of struggling artists.

14:32.878 --> 14:34.646
You must like Greg, though.
He's from money, right?

14:34.680 --> 14:36.748
It was never
about the money, Richard.

14:36.782 --> 14:38.283
It was about character.

14:38.317 --> 14:41.552
And you would know that
if you had any.

14:43.255 --> 14:45.156
Wow.

14:45.190 --> 14:47.124
Just imagine--
if things had worked out...

14:47.159 --> 14:49.427
you'd be spending
thanksgivings with her.

14:50.729 --> 14:53.697
Beckett. Okay, great.

14:54.531 --> 14:55.933
They think they found Mike.

14:55.967 --> 14:58.135
help!

14:58.169 --> 15:00.804
Anybody! Help!

15:03.408 --> 15:05.876
Mr. Weitz? Mike.

15:05.910 --> 15:09.146
Where's that bitch Sophie?
I'll kill her.

15:09.181 --> 15:11.616
Timing--very poor.

15:11.684 --> 15:13.151
What happened?

15:13.185 --> 15:16.054
That little freak drugged me.

15:19.996 --> 15:21.263
All right, Mike.

15:21.297 --> 15:23.798
Walk me through what happened
with you and Sophie last night.

15:23.833 --> 15:25.800
Mm. She came on to me
is what happened.

15:25.835 --> 15:29.336
Acted all flirty,
brought me a drink.

15:29.371 --> 15:30.705
A drink
spiked with roofies.

15:30.706 --> 15:32.006
Yeah, nuts, right?

15:32.040 --> 15:35.075
I mean, who roofies a guy?
All a girl has to do is ask.

15:35.109 --> 15:35.943
Mm.

15:35.977 --> 15:37.877
Did the two of you
have history?

15:37.911 --> 15:41.179
No. I mean,
I-I saw her last year

15:41.213 --> 15:43.248
at Greg and Kyra's
engagement party.

15:43.283 --> 15:45.684
She was definitely
the kind of girl you noticed.

15:45.718 --> 15:48.552
But, uh, no, I-I don't think
we so much as even talked.

15:48.587 --> 15:50.288
Any idea
why she'd want to drug you?

15:50.289 --> 15:51.289
No clue.

15:51.623 --> 15:54.358
Did she seem angry,
nervous or scared?

15:54.392 --> 15:58.395
No.
She seemed... determined.

15:58.430 --> 16:01.432
Guess I should've known
it was too good to be true, huh?

16:01.466 --> 16:02.974
If you can think of
anything else, let us know.

16:02.975 --> 16:03.975
Okay.

16:08.413 --> 16:10.381
What was Sophie up to
last night?

16:10.415 --> 16:12.917
She went out of her way
to get those drugs.

16:12.951 --> 16:14.185
She definitely had a plan.

16:14.320 --> 16:16.154
To roofie Mike
and lock him in a closet?

16:16.188 --> 16:17.989
What kind of a bizarre plan
is that?

16:18.024 --> 16:20.826
Maybe...

16:21.860 --> 16:23.294
No, I got nothing.

16:23.329 --> 16:25.663
Oh, dude. Catering.
Grab it. Oh, I'm so hungry.

16:25.697 --> 16:28.265
What is that? Thanks.
Mmm.

16:28.300 --> 16:29.567
Mm-hmm.

16:29.601 --> 16:31.035
What are you guys doing?

16:31.069 --> 16:33.502
Haven't eaten all day.
Oh.

16:33.536 --> 16:34.969
These potato pancakes
are incredible.

16:35.003 --> 16:37.569
You know what else is incredible?
Hmm?

16:37.603 --> 16:39.369
How much information
we're gonna find

16:39.404 --> 16:41.869
once we start investigating
our victim's life.

16:41.904 --> 16:44.369
I want to know everything
about Sophie Ronson

16:44.404 --> 16:46.605
from the moment that her plane
landed in New York

16:46.639 --> 16:48.606
to the moment
she was found dead--

16:48.641 --> 16:51.743
Who she called, what she did
and where she ate.

16:51.777 --> 16:53.744
This is
Detective Kate Beckett.

16:53.779 --> 16:57.418
I need a warrant on financials
for a Sophie Ronson.

16:57.452 --> 16:58.786
Yeah, it's Ryan.
Hey, Sarah.

16:58.821 --> 17:00.255
Yeah.
Yeah, I need you to reach out
to all the taxi dispatchers...

17:00.290 --> 17:00.923
Do me a favor.
I need the cell records on Sophie Ronson.

17:00.991 --> 17:03.093
Uh, in about an hour.
All right.

17:18.736 --> 17:21.772
Couldn't let it
go to waste.

17:21.807 --> 17:23.241
How did you find me?

17:23.276 --> 17:25.210
I just figured,
what was the one place

17:25.243 --> 17:27.012
where no one would think
to look for you?

17:27.012 --> 17:28.012
At a wedding.

17:28.047 --> 17:30.048
At your wedding.

17:30.082 --> 17:32.250
Where's...
Greg.

17:32.284 --> 17:34.318
- Right.
- He's taking care of things.

17:34.353 --> 17:36.053
He's good at that.

17:37.356 --> 17:40.090
So if you don't get married,

17:40.124 --> 17:42.325
is it just
a regular old cake?

17:42.360 --> 17:44.260
It's still wedding cake.

17:44.294 --> 17:48.230
It's tiered, cut flowers,
it's in a ballroom.

17:48.265 --> 17:49.765
Mm.

17:49.800 --> 17:52.803
If things had gone
as planned today,

17:52.838 --> 17:55.005
I would be twirling around

17:55.039 --> 17:58.108
on the dance floor with
my husband right about now.

17:59.342 --> 18:01.745
Do you remember
the last time we danced?

18:02.779 --> 18:06.083
Under the clock
at Grand Central Station.

18:06.117 --> 18:08.685
You were on your way to JFK
to catch a flight to London.

18:08.720 --> 18:09.789
You were
supposed to follow me.

18:09.790 --> 18:11.990
You said you needed space.

18:12.223 --> 18:16.026
I didn't mean forever.

18:21.999 --> 18:25.101
So you've done
all of this before.

18:25.135 --> 18:26.702
Twice.

18:26.736 --> 18:30.506
And each time, did you think
that she was the one?

18:30.540 --> 18:33.642
It seemed like the right thing
to do at the time.

18:33.677 --> 18:36.178
But it wasn't, was it?

18:39.448 --> 18:42.418
Some girls would think
what happened today is a sign.

18:42.453 --> 18:44.187
The murder?

18:44.221 --> 18:46.389
And you.

18:48.526 --> 18:50.494
Castle.

18:53.230 --> 18:55.532
We're on our way.
I thought you might need a ride.

18:56.467 --> 18:58.267
I should go upstairs.

18:58.302 --> 19:01.138
They'll be looking for me.

19:15.119 --> 19:16.285
Cake?

19:16.320 --> 19:19.021
No, thank you.

19:27.261 --> 19:29.162
We met in college.

19:29.196 --> 19:32.098
We were together
nearly three years.

19:32.132 --> 19:33.366
I didn't ask.

19:33.401 --> 19:35.336
Yes, you were not asking
very loudly.

19:37.470 --> 19:39.272
She's different
from your ex-wives.

19:40.506 --> 19:41.841
What do you mean?

19:42.875 --> 19:44.544
She's real.

19:44.578 --> 19:47.147
I didn't think
you went for real.

19:49.717 --> 19:51.117
Tough breakup?

19:53.220 --> 19:55.956
It was a long time ago.

20:00.527 --> 20:02.461
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:02.495 --> 20:04.495
- You called?
- Yes.

20:04.530 --> 20:07.965
I found traces of metal in
the abrasions on Sophie's back.

20:07.999 --> 20:10.000
- What kind of metal?
- I have no idea.

20:10.034 --> 20:12.002
But I sent a sample
over to the FBI Lab

20:12.036 --> 20:13.870
to see if they can narrow down
the chemical signature.

20:13.904 --> 20:15.406
We should have the results
tomorrow.

20:15.407 --> 20:16.807
If I find the object
that made the wounds,

20:16.940 --> 20:17.741
you'll be able to match it?

20:17.742 --> 20:18.742
Absolutely.

20:19.176 --> 20:20.643
Great. Anything else?

20:20.677 --> 20:22.478
You tell me.

20:22.512 --> 20:24.213
What?

20:24.247 --> 20:26.749
Don't "what" me.
Castle's lost love.

20:26.783 --> 20:28.317
Yeah. What about it?

20:28.351 --> 20:29.751
Girl, I'm gonna smack you.

20:29.785 --> 20:32.555
You work side by side
every day.

20:32.590 --> 20:34.526
He writes a sex scene
in his book about you

20:34.560 --> 20:36.462
that had me
reaching for ice water.

20:36.496 --> 20:37.930
Now little miss bride
shows up.

20:37.965 --> 20:39.570
Don't tell me you're not
the least bit jealous.

20:39.571 --> 20:40.571
Oh, please.

20:40.604 --> 20:43.140
You have been inhaling
too many autopsy fluids.

20:43.175 --> 20:46.544
<i>Honey, just because you
can't see what's going on</i>

20:46.578 --> 20:48.380
doesn't mean everyone else
doesn't see what's going on.

20:48.614 --> 20:50.115
Shut up.

20:50.150 --> 20:53.517
Mm-hmm. 'cause I see it.

20:53.852 --> 20:55.619
You may not, but I do.

20:56.754 --> 20:58.188
There's a lot of detail
in this love scene.

20:58.223 --> 21:00.424
Aren't you guys supposed to be
running background checks?

21:00.458 --> 21:02.092
We are.
On the bride.

21:02.126 --> 21:03.828
All day yesterday,
I kept feeling like

21:03.862 --> 21:05.630
I'd heard the name
Kyra Blaine before.

21:05.665 --> 21:06.998
And then it hits me--

21:07.033 --> 21:08.800
The dedication
of Castle's second book,

21:09.235 --> 21:11.169
"a rose for ever after."

21:11.803 --> 21:14.571
"for Kyra Blaine,
you make the stars shine."

21:16.607 --> 21:18.476
When I'm not here, do you guys
braid each other's hair

21:18.510 --> 21:20.112
and debate who's the coolest
Jonas brother?

21:20.113 --> 21:21.613
No, but it's totally Nick.

21:21.646 --> 21:24.148
Absolutely Nick. Yep.
Kevin's the talented one.

21:24.182 --> 21:27.617
Yeah, Nick's the cute one.
Joe?

21:32.556 --> 21:34.690
The key card.

21:34.724 --> 21:36.191
Mike's key card!

21:36.226 --> 21:38.193
Hotel records indicate
that Mike's key card

21:38.228 --> 21:40.863
last accessed his hotel room
at 2:00 am yesterday morning.

21:40.897 --> 21:42.865
Only he was busy
passed out in a supply closet

21:42.899 --> 21:44.135
With a bellyful
of roofies.

21:44.136 --> 21:45.936
So who swiped
into Mike's room?

21:48.169 --> 21:50.738
Mike said his key card
was missing when he woke up.

21:51.772 --> 21:53.975
Well, Sophie must have
stolen it. But why?

21:54.209 --> 21:56.577
Thank you.

21:57.845 --> 21:59.113
Didn't uniforms
already search this room

21:59.147 --> 22:00.581
when he went missing?

22:00.615 --> 22:02.551
Yeah. Mike said he didn't
notice anything out of place.

22:02.585 --> 22:05.920
So what could be so important
in this room

22:05.954 --> 22:08.890
it'd be worth the trouble
of drugging a man?

22:12.626 --> 22:14.695
Maybe it wasn't this room
she was trying to get in to.

22:14.930 --> 22:15.797
The only reason

22:15.831 --> 22:19.001
to unlock the door
adjacent to yours is if...

22:21.406 --> 22:23.406
You knew
who your neighbor was.

22:25.842 --> 22:28.144
Maybe Sophie only wanted
to get in to Mike's room

22:28.178 --> 22:29.413
so she could
get in to this one.

22:30.447 --> 22:31.748
So whose room is this?

22:38.923 --> 22:40.257
Castle.

22:49.168 --> 22:52.237
Sophie's missing earring.

22:52.271 --> 22:54.540
This could be
where she was killed.

22:58.344 --> 23:00.346
Hey, what are you doing
in my room?

23:10.742 --> 23:13.577
this is crazy.
I did not kill Sophie Ronson.

23:13.611 --> 23:16.713
Then how did her earring
end up in your room?

23:16.748 --> 23:18.682
You have a chance
to come clean here, Greg.

23:18.716 --> 23:22.184
If I were you,
I would take it.

23:22.219 --> 23:24.252
I got back to the room
around 1:00.

23:24.287 --> 23:25.620
I was pretty drunk.

23:25.655 --> 23:28.156
Next thing I know,
it was 2:00 in the morning,

23:28.191 --> 23:30.191
and somebody
was in bed with me,

23:30.226 --> 23:32.760
and they had their hands
down my pants.

23:32.794 --> 23:35.362
I thought it was Kyra. I-I-I
figured she changed her mind

23:35.396 --> 23:36.465
about spending the night apart.

23:36.466 --> 23:37.466
But it wasn't. It was Sophie.

23:38.700 --> 23:40.468
And you figured, what the hell?
Love the one you're with.

23:40.469 --> 23:41.269
No.

23:41.303 --> 23:43.271
Oh, come on, Greg.
Sophie's a beautiful girl,

23:43.305 --> 23:45.275
and you were hours away
from strapping on

23:45.310 --> 23:46.350
the ball and chain for life.

23:46.351 --> 23:49.351
No. I love Kyra.
I would never cheat on her,

23:49.684 --> 23:50.719
Especially with Sophie.

23:51.753 --> 23:53.489
Why especially with Sophie?

23:55.624 --> 23:57.725
Had you
slept with her before?

23:58.960 --> 24:01.831
Why is he here?
He's a writer, not a cop.

24:01.866 --> 24:04.804
Answer the question, Greg.
Did you ever sleep with Sophie?

24:06.439 --> 24:07.675
Once or twice.

24:07.709 --> 24:09.811
But it was before
Kyra and I even met,

24:09.846 --> 24:11.317
And we both knew
that it was a mistake.

24:11.318 --> 24:12.918
A mistake
that Sophie tried to repeat.

24:13.052 --> 24:14.686
Or maybe she succeeded.

24:14.721 --> 24:17.123
No. When I saw her,
I freaked.

24:17.158 --> 24:19.093
I shoved her away.
She fell on the floor.

24:19.128 --> 24:21.663
That must have been
when her earring came off.

24:21.697 --> 24:24.366
Before I could do anything else,
she ran out the door.

24:24.400 --> 24:26.935
I-I mean it all happened
so fast, it didn't--

24:26.969 --> 24:28.970
It didn't even
seem like it was real.

24:29.005 --> 24:30.372
Why didn't you say anything

24:30.406 --> 24:33.075
when you found out
that Sophie was murdered?

24:33.109 --> 24:34.977
Because I knew
how it would sound.

24:35.011 --> 24:37.412
Pretty much like it sounds
right now, like a lie.

24:37.446 --> 24:38.915
Okay, that's it.
I want him gone.

24:39.050 --> 24:40.853
He's clearly
got it out for me

24:40.887 --> 24:42.957
'cause he wants to get back
in my fiancée's pants.

24:42.958 --> 24:44.658
I'm not
the murder suspect here.

24:44.791 --> 24:46.893
I am done answering questions
until he is gone.

24:46.894 --> 24:48.394
You don't make
demands here, Greg.

24:48.428 --> 24:49.663
Castle.

24:50.297 --> 24:52.300
Go and see if Ryan and Esposito
have come back

24:52.335 --> 24:54.038
with the forensics
from Greg's hotel room.

25:03.879 --> 25:05.782
Now walk me through
what happened again.

25:11.488 --> 25:12.689
Hey, don't you worry
about this, Greg.

25:12.723 --> 25:13.790
I got your back covered.

25:13.825 --> 25:14.959
Thanks, uncle Teddy.

25:20.063 --> 25:22.497
Can't believe you're letting him
just walk out of here.

25:22.532 --> 25:24.667
Yeah, well, I don't have
enough evidence to convict him.

25:24.668 --> 25:26.168
Oh, don't tell me
you believe that story.

25:26.201 --> 25:28.036
It's like a porn movie
gone wrong.

25:28.070 --> 25:29.938
Exactly, and if you were
gonna make up a story,

25:30.073 --> 25:31.340
would you make up
something like that?

25:31.341 --> 25:33.741
So? The guy is a suit,
not a storyteller.

25:33.775 --> 25:34.976
It doesn't make him
any less guilty.

25:34.977 --> 25:37.477
Look, don't get me wrong.
He's still our best suspect.

25:37.511 --> 25:39.644
I'm just not as ready
to convict him of murder

25:39.679 --> 25:40.513
as you seem to be.

25:40.514 --> 25:42.414
Is that why you kicked me out
of the interrogation?

25:42.847 --> 25:44.783
It was clear that I was gonna
get more out of Greg alone.

25:44.817 --> 25:46.718
You're just too close
to this case to see that.

25:47.653 --> 25:49.354
You mean
I'm too close to her.

25:49.389 --> 25:51.757
Yes, and do you know
how I know that?

25:51.991 --> 25:54.360
If you weren't, you'd be
all over the possibility

25:54.394 --> 25:55.762
that Kyra
could've killed Sophie.

25:55.763 --> 25:56.863
That's impossible.

25:56.897 --> 25:59.798
See, that's not what
Richard Castle would say.

26:00.332 --> 26:03.468
He would paint a picture about
the night before the wedding,

26:04.102 --> 26:06.137
about how Kyra
couldn't fall asleep,

26:06.171 --> 26:07.505
and so she went down
to see Greg

26:07.639 --> 26:09.507
only to find Sophie
emerging from his room,

26:09.542 --> 26:12.277
and the thought that her fiancé
could cheat on her

26:12.311 --> 26:14.846
the night before their wedding
was too much.

26:14.880 --> 26:18.049
And so she follows Sophie
to her room and confronts her.

26:18.083 --> 26:21.218
And when things get violent,
Sophie ends up dead.

26:23.688 --> 26:25.723
You have to stay away
from her, Castle,

26:25.757 --> 26:28.058
until this case is closed.

26:52.683 --> 26:55.887
Richard Castle,
what the hell are you doing?

26:55.888 --> 26:57.088
Nothing.

26:57.121 --> 26:59.390
She's getting married
to another man.

26:59.391 --> 27:01.191
It's just a picture.

27:01.225 --> 27:03.359
No, it's a loaded gun.

27:04.562 --> 27:05.595
Castle.

27:05.629 --> 27:07.530
Is everybody's wedding
like this?

27:07.565 --> 27:08.898
Kyra.

27:08.933 --> 27:11.034
So my bridesmaid's dead,

27:11.068 --> 27:13.269
Uh, my fiancé might be
a murderer,

27:13.304 --> 27:14.306
and then there's you.

27:14.407 --> 27:16.407
You've just been through
a bad shock. That's all.

27:16.841 --> 27:19.509
Will you come meet me
somewhere?

27:19.543 --> 27:20.711
I don't think that'd be
a good idea.

27:20.712 --> 27:21.712
Please.

27:21.946 --> 27:24.847
I just need to get out of
the hotel for a little while.

27:24.882 --> 27:27.483
I-if I have to listen to
my mother judge me anymore,

27:27.518 --> 27:29.452
I might start taking hostages.

27:29.486 --> 27:32.121
I understand completely.

27:32.155 --> 27:34.490
How about the roof?

27:34.524 --> 27:36.959
Our secret roof.

27:36.994 --> 27:38.728
That's perfect.

27:38.762 --> 27:40.663

Did I or did I not
make myself clear?

30:03.766 --> 30:05.669
Yes.

30:05.703 --> 30:08.138
Do you know how much it annoys
me, knowing what you're doing--

30:08.172 --> 30:10.273
touching things that should,

30:10.307 --> 30:12.742
Yanking on things
that shouldn't be yanked?

30:12.776 --> 30:13.877
No one--no, no, body
yanked on anything.

30:13.912 --> 30:16.413
Really? Then how
do you explain this?

30:19.049 --> 30:19.816
Huh?

30:19.817 --> 30:20.617
Oh, don't give me
that look.

30:20.657 --> 30:23.060
I've told you a million times
not to mess with my chair.

30:24.762 --> 30:26.062
Right. No.

30:26.794 --> 30:28.695
I'm sorry.

30:28.729 --> 30:30.797
And it--
it won't happen again.

30:42.543 --> 30:43.844
I saw her last night.

30:49.983 --> 30:51.516
I know.

30:51.551 --> 30:53.518
What?

31:06.800 --> 31:08.101
You had me
under surveillance?

31:08.135 --> 31:09.938
Not you. Kyra.

31:09.939 --> 31:11.439
Why would you have Kyra
under surveillance?

31:11.472 --> 31:12.873
She's a murder suspect.

31:13.507 --> 31:15.708
Oh, no, no, see,
Sophie's murder

31:15.742 --> 31:17.877
was an isolated
crime of passion.

31:17.912 --> 31:18.613
Watching Kyra after the fact

31:18.647 --> 31:20.548
would be a waste
of police resources,

31:20.582 --> 31:22.884
which we both know
you would not do.

31:22.919 --> 31:25.688
I had to make sure that you
didn'to anything stupid,

31:25.722 --> 31:26.824
which you did.

31:26.825 --> 31:29.525
We just kissed.
That's all that happened.

31:29.559 --> 31:31.360
That's all that happened
for now.

31:31.494 --> 31:32.562
Hey, the financial...

31:34.296 --> 31:35.331
Everything okay?

31:35.365 --> 31:37.300
- Yeah.
- No.

31:37.835 --> 31:39.469
Okay.

31:39.503 --> 31:41.739
Financials came in
on our groom. No red flags.

31:41.773 --> 31:43.877
He actually lives pretty modest
for someone with a trust fund.

31:43.878 --> 31:45.078
Anything back from the lab?

31:45.111 --> 31:46.278
Nothing useful.

31:46.313 --> 31:48.614
Greg's hair and fiber samples
came back negative.

31:48.648 --> 31:50.483
Other than the earring,
there's no physical evidence

31:50.517 --> 31:51.619
tying him to the murder.

31:51.620 --> 31:53.820
So I retraced Sophie's steps
leading up to the wedding.

31:53.854 --> 31:55.890
She checked into the Beaumont
on Friday,

31:55.924 --> 31:57.960
but she flew in to the city
on Thursday morning.

31:57.961 --> 32:00.161
What was she doing
all day Thursday?

32:00.394 --> 32:03.395
I don't know. I didn't even see
her until the rehearsal dinner,

32:04.029 --> 32:05.129
and we didn't even talk.

32:05.263 --> 32:08.231
I'm afraid I can't help you.
I, uh, I barely knew the girl.

32:08.265 --> 32:10.399
No, the first time
I saw Sophie

32:10.433 --> 32:12.432
was at the wedding breakfast
on Friday morning.

32:12.866 --> 32:14.899
I have no idea
what Sophie was doing,

32:15.134 --> 32:17.565
But I'm sure
it was nothing good.

32:17.599 --> 32:20.567
Did you know that she called me
after the engagement party

32:20.601 --> 32:22.768
to ask me
to pay for her flight?

32:22.803 --> 32:24.470
- And did you?
- Of course not.

32:24.705 --> 32:27.573
I told her, people have to
make their own way.

32:27.607 --> 32:30.176
So you have no idea
what Sophie did on Thursday?

32:30.810 --> 32:33.278
No. But guess what
she was doing on Friday

32:33.312 --> 32:34.847
when I first saw her.

32:34.881 --> 32:35.682
What's that?

32:35.683 --> 32:37.683
Shopping at the hotel store.

32:37.716 --> 32:40.918
Here she is telling
everybody how broke she is,

32:41.052 --> 32:44.254
and somehow... oh, suddenly,
she has money to burn.

32:45.888 --> 32:48.857
Between the shoes, the dress,
the hotel and the flight,

32:48.892 --> 32:51.526
Sophie must have dropped 3 grand
on this weekend, easy.

32:51.761 --> 32:54.328
I don't know how.
Her bank balance is $18

32:54.363 --> 32:56.297
and her credit cards
are maxed out.

32:55.331 --> 32:58.332
How much did the drug dealer
say she paid for the roofies?

32:58.367 --> 32:59.735
200 bucks cash.

32:59.936 --> 33:00.936
The problem is,

33:00.969 --> 33:03.503
Sophie withdrew her last $100
to fly to New York.

33:03.637 --> 33:05.906
As far as I can tell, she didn't
have the 200 bucks to give.

33:05.907 --> 33:07.507
So who paid for the drugs?

33:07.641 --> 33:09.775
Forget the drugs. I've been
a bridesmaid six times.

33:09.809 --> 33:11.378
How did she pay
for the dress?

33:13.512 --> 33:14.714
Okay, thank you.

33:15.948 --> 33:17.983
So not only did Sophie pay
for her flight in cash,

33:18.018 --> 33:21.385
but she also made her last three
rent payments in cash as well.

33:21.520 --> 33:22.587
Any idea
where it all came from?

33:22.588 --> 33:23.588
Not yet.

33:24.622 --> 33:28.156
So... six times
a bridesmaid, huh?

33:28.891 --> 33:31.459
You wouldn't happen to have
any pictures, would you?

33:31.493 --> 33:34.027
Who feels like watching a little
bridal shop surveillance video?

33:34.062 --> 33:36.196
- Is it good?
-Will--will I be shocked?

33:36.297 --> 33:38.200
Oh, you definitely
did not see this one coming.

33:40.434 --> 33:42.102
Okay, there's Sophie.

33:46.808 --> 33:47.809
Greg's uncle Teddy.

33:47.810 --> 33:49.210
He said he barely knew her.

33:49.343 --> 33:50.477
Oh, he definitely knew her.

33:50.512 --> 33:51.813
According to
the bridal shop owner,

33:51.847 --> 33:53.482
when Teddy was paying
for the dress, Sophie told him

33:53.516 --> 33:54.786
She wasn't sure
if she could go through with it.

33:54.787 --> 33:56.487
But Teddy said,
after all he'd done for her,

33:56.520 --> 33:58.023
she couldn't back out now.

33:58.024 --> 34:00.524
Now I've heard of brides getting
cold feet. But bridesmaids?

34:01.458 --> 34:02.794
Did he pay for the dress
in cash?

34:02.795 --> 34:04.495
Yep. How'd you know?

34:04.528 --> 34:06.496
All that cash means that
uncle sugar daddy didn't want

34:06.498 --> 34:08.866
a paper trail tying him to whatever
Sophie was doing for him.

34:08.900 --> 34:11.335
Yeah, but what could it be?
And why was it so important

34:11.469 --> 34:13.005
for Sophie to go
to Greg's wedding?

34:18.078 --> 34:19.378
This is ridiculous.

34:19.411 --> 34:21.545
You don't have enough to build
a case against me,

34:21.614 --> 34:23.449
so you go after someone else
in my family?

34:23.449 --> 34:24.650
We're trying to get to the truth.

34:24.650 --> 34:26.051
By hauling in my uncle?

34:26.083 --> 34:28.350
For God sakes,
he barely knew Sophie.

34:28.384 --> 34:30.185
And yet he paid
for her $700 dress

34:30.219 --> 34:31.719
and her plane ticket
out here.

34:31.821 --> 34:33.221
He bought her dress?

34:33.455 --> 34:35.889
If he barely knew her,
why would he do that?

34:35.922 --> 34:37.324
We heard
through the grapevine

34:37.358 --> 34:39.059
that Sophie might have
some trouble making the money

34:39.092 --> 34:40.127
to come out here
to the wedding.

34:40.860 --> 34:43.096
Maybe Teddy was trying
to help her out for us.

34:43.097 --> 34:44.996
That doesn't explain
the $1,500

34:45.030 --> 34:46.232
that he paid her
the last three month.

34:46.233 --> 34:47.833
He was--  he was paying her?

34:47.866 --> 34:48.666
Mm-hmm.

34:48.667 --> 34:49.567
For what?

34:49.601 --> 34:50.967
Some kind of deal
they got going on.

34:51.002 --> 34:52.203
We think
it could have something to do

34:52.237 --> 34:54.105
with the way she was behaving
the night before your wedding.

34:54.106 --> 34:55.106
Yeah, sure.

34:55.139 --> 34:57.407
Uh, he--he paid Sophie
to roofie a groomsman

34:57.441 --> 34:58.976
and then to climb into bed
with me.

34:58.977 --> 34:59.977
Look, we know how this sounds--

35:00.010 --> 35:02.345
It sounds like something out of
one of Rick's little books.

35:02.346 --> 35:03.246
Little books?

35:03.279 --> 35:04.780
What would even be
the point of that

35:04.814 --> 35:06.182
except to mess up the wedding?

35:06.216 --> 35:07.384
Why the hell would Teddy
want that?

35:07.385 --> 35:08.885
That's what we're trying
to find out.

35:08.919 --> 35:10.653
Oh, my God. For God sakes.
Next you're gonna tell me

35:10.687 --> 35:12.289
that he's in love
with Kyra, too.

35:12.290 --> 35:13.790
What is that supposed to mean?

35:13.823 --> 35:14.591
You guys--

35:14.592 --> 35:15.992
You know damn well
what it's supposed to mean.

35:15.993 --> 35:17.193
- No Greg, I don't.
-  Whoa.

35:17.226 --> 35:18.394
If you've
got something to say to me,

35:18.428 --> 35:19.564
why don't you just say it?

35:19.565 --> 35:23.265
I love Kyra, Rick.
She means the world to me.

35:23.298 --> 35:25.967
Maybe you can't see it.
Maybe you don't care.

35:26.001 --> 35:29.436
But Teddy has been nothing
but supportive of us

35:29.670 --> 35:30.604
the whole way.

35:30.639 --> 35:33.641
He filed our wedding license.
He helped us write our prenup.

35:33.875 --> 35:35.609
He always looks after...

35:37.212 --> 35:38.446
What?

35:38.480 --> 35:40.681
I gotta make a call.

35:49.289 --> 35:51.458
Do you know how long
I've been sitting in here?

35:51.492 --> 35:54.528
I'm sorry for the wait.
I hadn't had anything to eat.

35:54.562 --> 35:56.363
We couldn't decide
on a restaurant.

35:56.397 --> 35:58.965
What do you think this is,
funny?

35:59.000 --> 36:01.267
Do you recognize
these files, Mr. Murphy?

36:01.302 --> 36:02.736
You went to my office?

36:02.737 --> 36:04.237
We got a warrant first.
Don't worry.

36:04.170 --> 36:07.671
Look, a layman like you
couldn't possibly understand

36:07.706 --> 36:10.073
the financial
and the legal complications

36:10.108 --> 36:11.107
of an estate like Greg's.

36:11.942 --> 36:13.778
I think
he just called you stupid.

36:14.813 --> 36:17.350
Greg's grandparents
established a trust fund

36:17.384 --> 36:19.753
that he was going to receive
on his wedding day,

36:19.787 --> 36:22.589
and named you executor.
How am I doing so far?

36:22.623 --> 36:24.191
And for the past five years,

36:24.225 --> 36:25.693
you have been stealing
from that fund

36:25.728 --> 36:27.362
to fuel
your expensive lifestyle--

36:27.496 --> 36:29.863
A house in the Hamptons,
a Ferrari.

36:29.998 --> 36:32.232
A pair of top-of-the-line
breast implants.

36:32.266 --> 36:33.667
I'm assuming those aren't
for you, though.

36:33.701 --> 36:35.437
My personal life
is none of your business.

36:35.438 --> 36:37.538
It is when it leads
to a murder.

36:38.371 --> 36:40.138
You lost a ton of money
in the market.

36:40.173 --> 36:41.640
Everybody did.

36:41.674 --> 36:44.144
But not everybody had access
to Greg's trust fund.

36:44.378 --> 36:46.745
When you ran out of your own
money, you started using his.

36:46.880 --> 36:48.847
Burned through almost
the entire $2 million,

36:48.881 --> 36:51.415
and then when he called you to tell you
he was getting engaged, you panicked

36:51.685 --> 36:53.585
because you didn't have enough
equity to put it back.

36:53.620 --> 36:55.653
You realized the only way
to avoid detection

36:55.688 --> 36:57.255
was to put a stop
to the wedding, but how?

36:57.990 --> 36:59.491
Greg was clearly
in love with Kyra.

36:59.625 --> 37:00.827
Kyra was in love with him.

37:00.928 --> 37:02.528
And then you met Sophie
at the engagement party,

37:02.661 --> 37:04.895
and you realized that she was
the perfect instrument

37:04.930 --> 37:06.265
to sabotage Greg's wedding

37:06.299 --> 37:07.901
because she was so desperate
for money.

37:07.902 --> 37:08.902
That's ridiculous.

37:09.035 --> 37:11.671
The fact that she still
carried a torch for Greg

37:11.705 --> 37:13.539
made it that much easier
to convince her

37:13.574 --> 37:16.276
to sneak into Greg's room
in the middle of the night...

37:16.310 --> 37:19.182
With this-
Sophie's video camera.

37:20.616 --> 37:22.918
We found this in your luggage
in the hotel.

37:23.453 --> 37:25.821
It still has Sophie's
fingerprints all over it.

37:25.822 --> 37:28.525
Only she didn't quite get
the footage you were hoping for, did she.

37:29.427 --> 37:31.661
When Greg refused
Sophie's advances,

37:31.695 --> 37:32.896
she had a change of heart.

37:32.930 --> 37:35.699
She ran back to her room, where
you were there, waiting for her.

37:35.700 --> 37:36.700
What happened, Mr. Murphy?

37:36.833 --> 37:38.270
Did she threaten
to expose you,

37:38.304 --> 37:40.039
tell everybody
what you asked her to do?

37:40.040 --> 37:41.240
You couldn't let that happen.

37:41.540 --> 37:43.340
And then you realized
there was another way

37:43.373 --> 37:46.842
to sabotage Greg's wedding--
kill a bridesmaid.

37:47.276 --> 37:49.077
Wow. What a story.

37:49.078 --> 37:50.846
And very well told,
I might add.

37:51.080 --> 37:53.649
Yeah, but that'sll it is...
A story.

37:54.350 --> 37:55.250
Really?

37:55.484 --> 37:56.284
Mmmm.

37:56.285 --> 37:57.385
Do you remember
how I told you

37:57.419 --> 37:58.819
that we went through
your luggage?

37:59.453 --> 38:01.988
We found this tie tack.

38:03.222 --> 38:04.954
Platinum, right?

38:05.389 --> 38:08.419
Did you know that we found
trace evidence of platinum

38:08.454 --> 38:10.455
in the wounds
in Sophie's back?

38:10.589 --> 38:12.789
You probably didn't even realize
you were making them

38:12.790 --> 38:14.390
when you were choking her
from behind.

38:14.424 --> 38:15.858
Which is why
it never occurred to you

38:15.892 --> 38:18.093
to get rid of the one piece
of physical evidence

38:18.127 --> 38:19.230
that tied you to the crime.

38:19.231 --> 38:20.731
We're sorry
we kept you waiting.

38:24.499 --> 38:25.767
<i>Sophie,
what are you doing?</i>

38:25.802 --> 38:28.470
<i>Come on, Greg. You and me,
one last time.</i>

38:28.504 --> 38:29.838
<i>We were good together.</i>

38:29.972 --> 38:31.740
<i>No. Stop it.
Come on. It'll be fun.</i>

38:31.774 --> 38:33.175
<i>No. What's the matter
with you?</i>

38:33.209 --> 38:35.310
<i>I just thought--
I'm getting married tomorrow,
okay,</i>

38:35.345 --> 38:38.246
<i>to the woman that I love.</i>

38:39.780 --> 38:41.148
Teddy's plan
would've worked, too,

38:42.182 --> 38:43.918
if it weren't for the one thing
he didn't count on.

Greg.

38:47.689 --> 38:50.291
He's a good man, Kyra.

38:50.825 --> 38:52.794
He's an honorable man.

38:54.829 --> 38:56.229
And he loves you.

38:57.964 --> 38:59.833
I know.

39:00.168 --> 39:02.435
And I love him, too.

39:05.105 --> 39:06.605
But that does not mean

39:06.640 --> 39:09.176
that I'm not gonna think
about you from time to time.

39:09.210 --> 39:11.312
Oh, you better.

39:14.216 --> 39:16.050
Of all the murders

39:16.084 --> 39:18.553
in all the cities
at all the weddings...

39:20.187 --> 39:22.089
And you walk into mine.

39:22.923 --> 39:23.991
I'm glad I did.

39:31.366 --> 39:34.201
Thank you, Rick.

39:46.881 --> 39:49.015
He's all yours.
