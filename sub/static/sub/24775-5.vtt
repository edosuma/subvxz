00:41.240 --> 00:43.920
Where are we going?
It's gonna rain any time now.

00:45.120 --> 00:46.080
I don't know.

00:46.160 --> 00:48.800
Why not? You've had a map in your head
for two weeks,

00:48.880 --> 00:50.240
and now there's a techno map.

00:50.320 --> 00:52.760
Where's the fucking bunker?

00:52.840 --> 00:54.720
Patrick, this place isn't on the map.

00:54.800 --> 00:57.240
So your memory's gonna get us killed?

00:57.320 --> 00:58.880
See for yourself. It doesn't work!

00:58.960 --> 01:00.200
Let her think.

01:00.280 --> 01:03.560
You're defending her now? Great, Martin.

01:03.640 --> 01:06.280
-Shut up, Patrick, you idiot.
-What?

01:06.360 --> 01:10.600
-Do you want a slap in the face?
-Patrick, calm down! Take it easy!

01:10.680 --> 01:12.360
-Let's go up here.
-Yes, go up there.

01:12.440 --> 01:14.680
Don't do that.

01:15.880 --> 01:17.480
Take your time.

01:20.360 --> 01:22.320
This place isn't even on the map.

01:23.560 --> 01:26.520
Patrick? Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.320
I miss him too, Patrick.

01:28.400 --> 01:30.120
-What are you talking about?
-Jean.

01:30.560 --> 01:32.760
I don't want to talk about Jean
right now, okay?

01:36.520 --> 01:37.680
I miss him too.

01:40.240 --> 01:41.640
I miss him like crazy.

01:43.800 --> 01:45.600
Look, he was a fucking pain.

01:45.680 --> 01:47.280
Yes, he was a fucking pain.

01:59.240 --> 02:00.320
It's okay.

02:02.040 --> 02:03.600
He's right here, you know?

02:04.880 --> 02:05.720
Yeah.

02:06.480 --> 02:07.760
He's right here.

02:08.600 --> 02:09.440
Thanks.

02:12.280 --> 02:13.120
Should we...

02:14.400 --> 02:15.240
move on?

02:16.160 --> 02:17.160
What's that?

02:32.000 --> 02:33.520
What is this place?

02:34.080 --> 02:36.760
It looks creepy. I'm not going in there.

02:37.760 --> 02:39.400
So you'd rather die in the rain?

03:12.440 --> 03:14.160
We don't know who lives there.

03:14.640 --> 03:17.440
Why isn't it on the map?
It could be the Strangers.

03:17.520 --> 03:20.120
-Then we'll kill them.
-Do you know how many they are?

03:20.760 --> 03:23.720
It's that or the rain.
It's gonna pour down in a second.

03:24.280 --> 03:25.840
I really don't like this.

03:28.560 --> 03:29.640
Do you want to come in?

03:29.720 --> 03:31.640
Stay there. Stay.

03:32.440 --> 03:34.680
Put that down. I won't harm you.

03:35.720 --> 03:37.840
You're welcome inside, but no weapons.

03:38.280 --> 03:40.160
-I'm not handing over my weapon.
-Martin.

03:43.640 --> 03:45.000
We are peaceful people.

03:47.040 --> 03:48.040
How can I be sure?

03:48.120 --> 03:50.960
You can't, but you can choose
to believe me.

03:53.560 --> 03:55.240
Don't give them your gun, Martin.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
But you have to hand over your weapons
or we won't let you in.

03:59.720 --> 04:01.840
-Martin...
-Martin, come on.

04:02.400 --> 04:03.480
-Martin.
-Come on.

04:04.760 --> 04:07.400
It's going to start raining.
We need to get inside.

04:20.800 --> 04:23.640
Come on. Come on in.

04:27.920 --> 04:29.120
Come on in.

04:38.320 --> 04:39.520
What is this place?

04:40.880 --> 04:43.920
All you need to know
is that once you enter...

04:44.920 --> 04:46.360
you're part of us.

04:46.920 --> 04:48.920
Nothing outside can touch you.

04:50.880 --> 04:52.080
Whatever you used to be,

04:52.160 --> 04:56.120
all your problems and worries... are gone.

04:58.000 --> 05:03.240
There is no past here,
only you, right now.

05:08.960 --> 05:09.920
Rasmus?

05:12.320 --> 05:13.280
Is he infected?

05:13.360 --> 05:16.160
Rasmus. No, he had an accident.

05:16.800 --> 05:21.000
You need to sleep. You're tired.
Come with me.

05:41.040 --> 05:45.160
She locked the door. We're locked in.

05:45.720 --> 05:48.160
Why the hell did we come in here?

05:48.240 --> 05:50.000
You should have kept the gun.

05:50.080 --> 05:53.160
We're moving on as soon as the rain stops.

05:53.240 --> 05:55.320
Kind of hard when we're locked up.

05:55.400 --> 05:57.960
You think this is fucking funny?

05:58.040 --> 05:59.080
No.

06:39.040 --> 06:39.880
Good morning.

06:39.960 --> 06:40.840
Good morning.

06:42.040 --> 06:45.200
-How is he doing? Is he alive?
-Sure he is.

06:45.280 --> 06:46.160
Rasmus.

06:48.040 --> 06:49.640
-How are you?
-Breakfast is ready.

06:50.440 --> 06:51.560
You've got food?

06:51.640 --> 06:53.320
Yes, of course there's food.

06:54.760 --> 06:55.840
Are we going to eat?

06:58.280 --> 06:59.560
It's so beautiful.

07:01.280 --> 07:02.760
And peaceful.

07:08.040 --> 07:09.800
-Hi.
-Hi.

07:10.480 --> 07:11.480
Oh, lovely.

07:13.760 --> 07:15.080
Very good.

07:15.520 --> 07:16.720
Look.

07:26.960 --> 07:27.840
Come.

07:45.880 --> 07:47.200
Go on down.

07:48.720 --> 07:50.920
You must wash away the outside world.

07:53.080 --> 07:55.320
There you go. Isn't it nice here?

07:56.240 --> 08:01.520
Now I want you to take off your clothes
so that we can wash them.

08:02.160 --> 08:06.400
When you've showered,
there's a set of clothes

08:06.480 --> 08:09.120
for each of you in the stalls.

08:09.200 --> 08:11.920
You're not asking us to get wet, are you?

08:12.000 --> 08:14.640
Well, how else would you shower?

08:15.160 --> 08:16.720
Don't worry.

08:16.800 --> 08:19.320
We have our own well,
and we clean the water.

08:19.880 --> 08:22.000
Nothing here is dangerous.

08:22.080 --> 08:23.920
-Like the tomatoes?
-Precisely.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.560
Just like the tomatoes.

08:25.640 --> 08:26.520
Okay.

08:30.280 --> 08:31.680
You don't believe me?

08:31.760 --> 08:33.640
I see you're still skeptical.

08:33.720 --> 08:35.840
Wait and see, then. Look at this.

09:06.720 --> 09:08.560
Lea, come here.

09:08.640 --> 09:10.800
No, it's okay. It's okay.

09:13.840 --> 09:15.760
Not everything can be explained.

09:17.160 --> 09:19.320
But I see that you want to believe.

09:23.120 --> 09:24.800
You're safe to do that here.

09:38.760 --> 09:40.600
Jesus Christ.

09:42.680 --> 09:46.240
Okay, we're getting out of here.
Put your shoes on.

09:48.320 --> 09:49.880
We're in no hurry, Martin.

09:50.560 --> 09:53.160
Lea... put on your shoes.

09:54.880 --> 09:57.640
I know you're only trying to protect us,

09:58.040 --> 09:59.760
but maybe we should stay here a bit.

10:01.280 --> 10:04.200
-It's not dangerous.
-Maybe not.

10:04.280 --> 10:08.960
Isn't it odd to come to a strange place
and be offered tomatoes and showers?

10:09.040 --> 10:11.280
Sure it is.

10:11.360 --> 10:12.920
So put on your shoes.

10:14.680 --> 10:15.520
No.

10:19.480 --> 10:20.360
Martin...

10:21.320 --> 10:22.160
Come on.

10:27.160 --> 10:30.280
Okay, do whatever the hell you want.

10:32.920 --> 10:34.520
That's your call, Martin.

10:34.600 --> 10:36.680
Okay. Let's do it?

10:37.680 --> 10:38.640
Shall we do it?

10:39.560 --> 10:40.640
Okay.

10:41.800 --> 10:44.240
-Do we do a countdown?
-Let's do that.

10:44.320 --> 10:45.600
-Okay, yes.
-Five!

10:45.680 --> 10:48.320
-Four!
-No, wait!

12:11.960 --> 12:15.360
So... you sure took it all in, didn't you?

12:19.280 --> 12:20.160
Hello?

12:23.400 --> 12:26.040
-Took what in?
-What?

12:26.680 --> 12:27.600
Beatrice.

12:29.440 --> 12:30.800
I saw you.

12:34.040 --> 12:35.080
It's sweet.

12:37.080 --> 12:38.760
And she doesn't seem to mind.

12:40.240 --> 12:41.560
But she's with Martin.

12:43.680 --> 12:44.680
You didn't know?

12:46.000 --> 12:48.160
How do you mean?

12:49.800 --> 12:52.040
-You know, "with."
-"With"?

12:54.320 --> 12:58.840
-Hey, that's okay.
-Sure, I just thought you...

12:59.480 --> 13:00.520
What?

13:01.440 --> 13:03.520
-You thought that I what?
-Nothing.

13:04.760 --> 13:07.280
-Look, just put on your shirt.
-Yes.

13:14.480 --> 13:16.360
-Let me see that.
-Ouch, damn it.

13:16.440 --> 13:20.560
It's infected. We need a doctor.
It needs to be cleaned.

14:27.240 --> 14:29.320
You're not eating their food, are you?

14:29.400 --> 14:30.600
Yes, we are, Martin.

14:33.760 --> 14:36.040
-Who are you?
-Martin.

14:36.480 --> 14:39.600
What is this place?
How can you have vegetables and bread?

14:39.680 --> 14:42.840
Shut the fuck up.
They're just trying to be here.

14:42.920 --> 14:46.440
I found children's shoes.
See any children here?

14:46.880 --> 14:49.160
-They must have grown up or...
-Or what?

14:49.720 --> 14:52.840
What do you mean?
They're right outside, playing.

14:58.720 --> 15:00.320
You're interrupting their meal.

15:01.680 --> 15:04.320
And we don't wear our old clothes here.

15:04.800 --> 15:07.880
What's the deal with these hippie duds?

15:08.560 --> 15:10.680
Are you some sort of cult?

15:10.920 --> 15:15.160
I understand your doubts,
your questions...

15:15.840 --> 15:18.560
your distrust towards others.

15:19.440 --> 15:24.080
I, too, have had that nagging doubt.

15:25.280 --> 15:31.040
Who can I believe?
Can I trust anyone out there?

15:34.960 --> 15:37.520
But we've done away
with those doubts here.

15:37.600 --> 15:39.640
Just like that?

15:39.720 --> 15:41.160
How did you do that?

15:42.200 --> 15:44.960
By melting into one.

15:46.560 --> 15:51.280
It all boils down to:
what do I fear if I don't exist?

15:52.480 --> 15:54.440
We are one, and we are now.

15:55.280 --> 15:57.240
That's all that matters.

15:58.520 --> 16:00.800
-Is it good?
-It's delicious.

16:01.040 --> 16:02.960
Good. Dig in.

16:04.320 --> 16:07.480
We have no past, no name, no gender.

16:09.880 --> 16:12.840
It's the end of the world,
but we're right here,

16:12.920 --> 16:17.000
right now, and that's all that matters.

16:19.800 --> 16:21.920
Do you even hear what you're saying?

16:22.400 --> 16:24.360
That's the dumbest thing I ever heard.

16:25.600 --> 16:27.280
Calm down, Martin.

16:30.360 --> 16:32.840
They're trying to help us.

16:40.200 --> 16:42.920
I apologize for Martin, our friend.

16:44.160 --> 16:46.560
He means well.

16:48.560 --> 16:55.480
Some people react with fright
at all the love here.

16:58.160 --> 16:59.600
We're not so used to it.

17:01.240 --> 17:02.080
Love.

17:05.079 --> 17:06.760
You can stay if you want to.

17:08.400 --> 17:10.640
Settle down and become one of us.

17:11.160 --> 17:12.760
I think we have to move on.

17:14.720 --> 17:16.960
Our monthly celebration is tomorrow.

17:17.640 --> 17:18.760
What's that?

17:18.839 --> 17:22.359
Once a month, we share a nice meal...

17:23.359 --> 17:26.920
in silence and gratitude.

17:27.400 --> 17:28.600
You mustn't miss it.

17:34.560 --> 17:36.280
You remind me of my daughter.

17:40.840 --> 17:41.680
I do?

17:42.480 --> 17:43.320
Yes.

17:56.920 --> 18:00.160
I thought we agreed
you weren't going to the party.

18:03.360 --> 18:04.960
I changed my mind, Mom.

18:06.400 --> 18:08.000
I think you should stay home.

18:08.880 --> 18:09.960
It's for your own sake.

18:10.040 --> 18:15.280
If I don't go, it's for your sake.

18:16.720 --> 18:17.640
You know it is.

18:18.800 --> 18:20.560
It's just a party, Mom...

18:21.320 --> 18:23.320
not the end of the world.

18:25.040 --> 18:26.320
Will there be a lot of boys?

18:27.200 --> 18:30.000
The boys from school are coming.

18:31.560 --> 18:33.680
Are you going to drink and smoke?

18:34.240 --> 18:36.800
Maybe they are, but I'm not, am I?

18:38.080 --> 18:39.080
Mom...

18:40.920 --> 18:42.440
-You're wearing makeup?
-Stop it.

18:44.960 --> 18:45.960
Mom!

18:49.880 --> 18:52.400
Mom, you have to support me.

18:54.440 --> 18:57.720
-You always make me feel like a freak.
-You're not a freak.

18:57.800 --> 19:00.240
-But you make me feel like one.
-But you're not.

19:00.320 --> 19:01.240
No, I'm not.

19:01.320 --> 19:05.200
I'm going to the party,
and I won't stay out late.

19:16.400 --> 19:17.920
It's a deep wound.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.880
Yes, a doctor stitched him up...

19:20.960 --> 19:23.640
I don't want to know anything
about the past.

19:26.320 --> 19:27.560
What about the pills?

19:28.320 --> 19:31.160
-You're not having any more pills.
-But it really hurts.

19:36.600 --> 19:38.280
I'm going to sedate you.

19:40.040 --> 19:45.440
We're out of antibiotics.
You need to rest for at least a week.

19:52.160 --> 19:53.800
Wait. No, thanks.

19:54.520 --> 19:55.520
No sedative.

19:56.120 --> 19:56.960
Why not?

19:57.440 --> 19:59.120
I don't want him sedated.

20:00.320 --> 20:01.520
Can you stand the pain?

20:01.600 --> 20:02.640
I said no.

20:10.080 --> 20:12.280
We have morphine in our backpack.

20:12.360 --> 20:16.200
Good idea. He needs a painkiller.
I'll have it brought up.

20:18.080 --> 20:18.920
Thanks.

20:32.720 --> 20:34.840
This is the last one you're getting.

20:34.920 --> 20:35.920
Thanks.

21:37.240 --> 21:40.200
Sorry to interrupt , but I need to know.

21:40.840 --> 21:42.200
Who are you?

21:44.000 --> 21:47.080
Who are you? Are you connected to Apollon?

21:48.360 --> 21:50.320
That belongs to the past.

21:50.400 --> 21:51.240
This...

21:53.360 --> 21:54.200
You had this.

21:55.360 --> 21:57.080
-Yes.
-What is it?

21:58.800 --> 22:00.160
A sedative. I told you.

22:00.240 --> 22:01.800
A sedative?

22:04.400 --> 22:05.880
It's the same as this.

22:05.960 --> 22:10.120
It belonged to a doctor
who tried to kill me and my brother.

22:10.200 --> 22:11.280
Let me see.

22:11.360 --> 22:14.120
That is something else. Give it to me.

22:14.680 --> 22:16.640
-No.
-I'll take that.

22:16.960 --> 22:18.200
No, you don't.

22:18.280 --> 22:19.400
Give it to me.

22:19.480 --> 22:20.800
-What?
-No, don't.

22:20.880 --> 22:24.280
-Don't do that. Put it away.
-Why?

22:24.360 --> 22:26.520
-You can kill us all with that.
-What? Why?

22:26.600 --> 22:29.040
-Why did you bring it here?
-Tell me what's in it.

22:30.280 --> 22:33.040
Who made these? Where are they from?

22:33.960 --> 22:35.280
Leave the past be.

22:38.080 --> 22:41.200
I just want to know what's in it.

22:42.240 --> 22:44.800
Believe me... you don't.

22:54.080 --> 22:55.760
You understand, don't you?

22:56.520 --> 22:59.480
That we have to free ourselves
of the past.

23:00.800 --> 23:02.360
It's too difficult for me.

23:02.680 --> 23:04.440
I've done something terrible.

23:05.680 --> 23:08.640
You have to let it go. Please try.

23:09.320 --> 23:12.720
-No.
-Yes. I'll teach you.

23:13.520 --> 23:15.080
I don't think I can do it.

23:17.600 --> 23:19.960
If you can close your eyes
and breathe, you can.

23:20.040 --> 23:22.560
Close your eyes.

23:22.640 --> 23:25.000
There you go. You can do it.

23:26.240 --> 23:27.480
Now breathe.

23:28.200 --> 23:30.640
Take a deep breath through your nose.

23:34.080 --> 23:35.040
I can't do it.

23:36.880 --> 23:41.000
It's too hard.
You don't know what I've done.

23:43.840 --> 23:46.480
Let it out.

23:48.120 --> 23:50.040
Let it go.

23:53.120 --> 23:54.600
Let go of it.

23:58.280 --> 23:59.560
Lea, you came.

23:59.640 --> 24:00.800
I did.

24:02.240 --> 24:03.080
Hi.

24:04.440 --> 24:05.840
Nice dress.

24:05.920 --> 24:06.840
Thanks.

24:13.400 --> 24:16.240
-Everybody is so pleased that you came.
-Really?

24:16.320 --> 24:17.800
Yes, they are so pleased.

24:18.240 --> 24:20.920
Great. I wasn't sure.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.120
-Here's your Coke.
-Thanks.

24:23.840 --> 24:26.120
-Thanks for inviting me.
-Sure.

24:34.480 --> 24:35.800
Here's to the future!

24:35.880 --> 24:38.560
Here's to the future!

24:55.160 --> 24:56.040
Louder!

25:10.520 --> 25:11.600
Do you want to fuck?

25:17.680 --> 25:18.680
Lie down.

25:35.840 --> 25:37.040
Do you want to fuck?

25:52.120 --> 25:53.360
<i>I'll do it.</i>

25:53.440 --> 25:57.400
<i>-I want to.</i>
<i>-Look at the camera.</i>

25:57.480 --> 25:58.920
<i>Everybody wants to fuck.</i>

25:59.000 --> 26:00.920
<i>Lea, look at the camera.</i>

26:01.000 --> 26:02.040
Oh, Christian Lea?

26:02.120 --> 26:03.360
Don't forget the condom

26:03.440 --> 26:05.160
Sh** is that for real?

26:28.920 --> 26:30.280
<i>She's so gross.</i>

26:41.920 --> 26:42.960
<i>Is that you, Lea?</i>

26:43.840 --> 26:44.720
Mom.

26:51.240 --> 26:53.640
Mom, please come and get me.
I don't feel well.

26:53.720 --> 26:54.840
<i>I can't do that.</i>

26:59.160 --> 27:01.280
<i>I told you not to go.</i>

27:03.480 --> 27:04.480
Mom!

27:06.600 --> 27:09.040
<i>I've seen the video</i>
<i>from the party yesterday.</i>

27:10.680 --> 27:12.000
<i>Everybody has seen it.</i>

27:13.720 --> 27:14.920
<i>You're on your own.</i>

27:17.000 --> 27:17.880
Mom!

27:19.880 --> 27:22.160
Mom, just come and get me, please.

27:22.240 --> 27:23.440
<i>I'm hanging up now.</i>

27:26.960 --> 27:27.800
Mom?

27:30.680 --> 27:32.080
Mom, say something!

27:32.160 --> 27:33.280
<i>Goodbye, Lea.</i>

27:34.040 --> 27:34.880
Mom...

28:41.040 --> 28:42.280
What are you doing here?

28:43.800 --> 28:46.160
-Looking for the bathroom.
-You're not allowed here.

28:46.240 --> 28:47.920
No? Okay.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.320
-Go back upstairs.
-Sure.

28:59.120 --> 29:00.680
-Martin...
-Listen.

29:00.760 --> 29:02.440
There's a guy from Apollon here.

29:03.640 --> 29:04.520
What?

29:05.440 --> 29:07.640
They're keeping something from us.

29:08.480 --> 29:11.320
That's what I'm saying.
Something is going on.

29:11.400 --> 29:12.400
Come here.

29:12.480 --> 29:14.760
-I don't get what they're afraid of.
-Just come.

29:18.440 --> 29:19.280
Come.

29:29.680 --> 29:30.720
They were here.

29:32.880 --> 29:35.400
They were here just a minute ago.

29:36.680 --> 29:37.520
Right?

29:38.160 --> 29:40.280
They said I wasn't allowed down here.

29:40.920 --> 29:43.640
There's something wrong with this place.

29:44.880 --> 29:46.880
I think we should get out of here.

29:47.600 --> 29:49.120
-No, Martin.
-Yes.

29:50.400 --> 29:52.000
There's a guy from Apollon here.

29:54.160 --> 29:56.040
We have to find out why.

29:56.880 --> 30:00.720
Maybe he knows something
about my father. We have to stay.

30:05.240 --> 30:06.480
Have you seen Martin?

30:07.080 --> 30:07.920
Hi.

30:08.320 --> 30:09.160
Hi.

30:09.520 --> 30:12.360
No. Simone just left too.

30:15.080 --> 30:16.240
Does it still hurt?

30:17.440 --> 30:19.160
Not much.

30:23.920 --> 30:25.600
You don't have to act tough.

30:33.960 --> 30:35.800
We can tell each other everything.

30:38.680 --> 30:39.520
Everything?

30:42.400 --> 30:44.080
Are you and Martin a couple?

30:46.320 --> 30:47.520
You are, aren't you?

30:49.360 --> 30:50.480
I don't know.

30:52.520 --> 30:53.440
Strange.

30:55.920 --> 30:59.040
Yeah. But he isn't like you.

31:01.760 --> 31:02.800
What am I like?

31:03.240 --> 31:04.280
You're honest.

31:06.040 --> 31:07.240
Is that a good thing?

31:08.720 --> 31:09.720
It's pretty good.

31:11.360 --> 31:12.200
Very good.

31:13.160 --> 31:14.200
Hi.

31:15.640 --> 31:18.080
Hi. Beatrice is looking for Martin.

31:18.600 --> 31:19.680
Have you seen him?

31:23.640 --> 31:24.480
No.

31:26.480 --> 31:29.280
Okay. He must be in his room, then.

31:38.200 --> 31:39.240
Well?

31:40.000 --> 31:40.960
What?

32:02.640 --> 32:03.480
Hi.

32:04.120 --> 32:05.320
Where have you been?

32:10.040 --> 32:10.880
I...

32:12.160 --> 32:13.160
I've been...

32:15.080 --> 32:18.360
-in the basement.
-Strange first date, isn't it?

32:19.920 --> 32:20.760
What?

32:21.480 --> 32:23.600
You and Simone have been hanging out.

32:24.600 --> 32:25.720
No.

32:26.960 --> 32:28.760
-It's pretty obvious.
-No, listen.

32:28.840 --> 32:32.520
I'm trying to find out
what the hell's going on in this house.

32:32.600 --> 32:35.240
-It's so obvious.
-This isn't about us.

32:35.320 --> 32:38.280
-It sure isn't.
-No, it isn't. It's just that I...

32:39.320 --> 32:42.360
I feel like I'm losing all of you.

32:42.440 --> 32:43.640
-All of us?
-Yes.

32:45.480 --> 32:46.480
Right.

32:52.560 --> 32:55.960
Maybe Martin and Beatrice
aren't a real couple.

32:57.120 --> 32:58.480
Maybe they're just having sex.

33:02.240 --> 33:03.080
Yeah.

33:03.560 --> 33:05.640
-Did you ever have sex before the rain?
-No.

33:06.440 --> 33:07.880
-Before the rain...
-No!

33:08.760 --> 33:10.240
Don't you want to try it?

33:11.600 --> 33:14.520
I'm trying to figure out
whether to stay or to leave this place.

33:14.600 --> 33:15.920
-Okay?
-Yeah, okay.

33:18.400 --> 33:19.840
It seems natural to the others.

33:20.400 --> 33:22.080
Why do you ask?

33:22.160 --> 33:23.920
It's not a weird thing to talk about.

33:26.280 --> 33:28.840
It is with my little brother.

33:29.920 --> 33:33.280
Oh, okay. Maybe you should
talk to Martin about it.

33:33.760 --> 33:35.320
Cut it out!

33:39.400 --> 33:40.600
But don't you want to try?

33:53.120 --> 33:56.320
<i>-We're going to find my gun and leave.</i>
<i>-Why do you get to decide that?</i>

33:56.400 --> 34:01.240
I don't, Patrick.
This place is coming between us.

34:01.640 --> 34:03.840
-There's something wrong here.
-No, there isn't.

34:03.920 --> 34:07.400
Okay, fine, but we're still
in a quarantine zone.

34:07.480 --> 34:10.719
-Wasn't the plan to get out of it?
-What about the Apollon guy?

34:11.360 --> 34:13.840
-What?
-There's a guy from Apollon here.

34:13.920 --> 34:15.400
What does that mean?

34:15.480 --> 34:17.639
He was about to inject Rasmus
with something.

34:18.159 --> 34:19.199
He knows something.

34:19.280 --> 34:21.800
We'll find the answers somewhere else.

34:21.880 --> 34:23.840
We can't leave until Rasmus is better.

34:23.920 --> 34:25.320
But it's not safe here.

34:26.320 --> 34:28.960
-I vote to stay.
-Me too.

34:29.040 --> 34:29.880
For sure.

34:30.719 --> 34:32.320
-Good.
-Yes.

34:33.520 --> 34:35.360
Looks like you're going alone.

34:35.440 --> 34:36.360
You're crazy.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.880
Why don't you just leave
and we'll come later?

34:41.920 --> 34:43.159
What's happening to you?

34:43.239 --> 34:45.840
Why can't you just stay here with us?

34:45.920 --> 34:46.800
He can't.

34:48.880 --> 34:51.400
-He can't stand not being in charge.
-Bea...

34:52.320 --> 34:53.760
He'd rather be alone.

35:00.480 --> 35:02.360
-Lea, are you coming?
-Sure.

35:02.960 --> 35:04.040
Where are you going?

35:04.560 --> 35:06.920
We'll see you at the dinner.

35:08.160 --> 35:09.480
-Yeah.
-Come.

35:13.880 --> 35:14.880
Don't you see it?

35:17.960 --> 35:18.880
Martin...

35:24.720 --> 35:25.560
Hey.

35:34.680 --> 35:35.720
This is so wrong.

35:36.600 --> 35:37.800
It's his own choice.

36:05.840 --> 36:06.680
<i>Hello?</i>

36:08.000 --> 36:09.040
Is someone there?

36:13.640 --> 36:14.480
Hello?

36:39.000 --> 36:41.600
<i>Dear God... you need to help me.</i>

36:44.320 --> 36:49.120
I don't know what happened,
but you need to help me.

37:37.240 --> 37:38.480
<i>-Lea?</i>
-Mom?

37:39.480 --> 37:40.920
<i>Lea, can you hear me?</i>

37:41.760 --> 37:44.600
Mom, they...

37:46.760 --> 37:47.880
<i>Don't be sad.</i>

37:49.240 --> 37:51.440
<i>-I'll come pick you up.</i>
-Mom, don't leave.

37:51.520 --> 37:53.880
<i>-I'm leaving right now. I...</i>
-Don't go outside.

38:04.680 --> 38:06.280
My mom...

38:06.960 --> 38:09.400
I killed my mother.

38:09.840 --> 38:11.440
You lost your mother...

38:12.640 --> 38:14.400
but you didn't kill her.

38:17.680 --> 38:20.040
We all lost someone before we came here.

38:20.680 --> 38:25.360
Little Lea, you didn't kill anyone. Okay?

38:25.720 --> 38:26.720
Yes.

38:28.400 --> 38:29.960
Did you lose someone, too?

38:31.240 --> 38:32.080
Did you?

38:34.320 --> 38:35.160
A...

38:37.280 --> 38:38.960
A daughter and a grandchild.

38:40.920 --> 38:41.920
Where are they?

38:43.520 --> 38:44.360
Here.

38:47.440 --> 38:48.560
They're right here.

39:37.560 --> 39:41.720
Welcome to this,
our traditional monthly celebration.

39:42.600 --> 39:45.920
As usual, we will observe
absolute silence...

39:47.000 --> 39:48.600
both to honor the meal...

39:49.400 --> 39:56.080
and to open up to this boundless love
that will flow through us from the meal,

39:56.520 --> 39:58.160
dissolving us as individuals.

39:59.280 --> 40:01.200
We are each other.

40:01.800 --> 40:03.640
We are in each other.

40:04.560 --> 40:07.200
We are nothing without each other.

40:07.280 --> 40:08.240
Now eat.

40:08.680 --> 40:09.880
I hope you like it.

41:08.560 --> 41:10.200
I hope you all appreciated the meal.

41:11.280 --> 41:17.240
Now it's time to find the next person
who will gratify us with their body...

41:18.200 --> 41:20.440
thus getting eternal life.

41:22.560 --> 41:23.920
What is he talking about?

41:24.920 --> 41:25.880
What is this?

41:31.920 --> 41:33.560
Did we eat a human being?

41:40.200 --> 41:41.360
There now.

41:42.200 --> 41:43.080
Karen?

41:43.480 --> 41:49.000
You've been fortunate
to experience ultimate love.

41:53.480 --> 41:54.560
We want to leave.

41:54.960 --> 41:57.040
Sit down.

41:59.480 --> 42:02.840
Once you've partaken of the meal,
you're part of the community.

42:03.280 --> 42:06.960
The one who finds a flower
in the wrapper is the chosen one...

42:07.640 --> 42:09.560
and will come to the basement directly...

42:10.440 --> 42:11.920
-to give their life to us.
-Hey!

42:12.600 --> 42:14.640
-Martin.
-Stop!

42:15.840 --> 42:18.120
Step away! Step away from him!

42:18.600 --> 42:20.040
You can't stop this now.

42:21.200 --> 42:22.720
Your friends have to stay here...

42:23.160 --> 42:25.520
-Martin?
-...until we've found a flower.

42:25.600 --> 42:26.440
Martin?

42:28.600 --> 42:29.440
Martin?

42:30.960 --> 42:31.800
I'll start.

42:44.040 --> 42:45.120
Go ahead.

43:19.040 --> 43:21.120
I think we've found the chosen one.

43:26.640 --> 43:28.960
-What?
-Lea, sit down.

43:29.040 --> 43:31.280
-Shut up and sit down!
-What is this?

43:33.760 --> 43:34.840
What is this?

43:40.200 --> 43:41.160
Karen?

43:43.080 --> 43:45.720
You took the wrong one.

43:45.800 --> 43:47.280
-Karen?
-It's mine.

43:53.320 --> 43:56.280
-No!
-Thank you all for...

43:58.680 --> 44:03.040
for allowing me to become one of you.

44:05.000 --> 44:07.120
It's a huge honor for me to...

44:09.440 --> 44:11.360
to live on in you.

44:13.040 --> 44:14.040
Thank you.

44:14.120 --> 44:17.040
No! I need you.

44:17.800 --> 44:20.400
-No.
-Yes!

44:20.480 --> 44:21.800
Come, come, come.

44:23.600 --> 44:25.040
I need you.

44:26.520 --> 44:29.000
-You must live.
-No.

44:29.080 --> 44:30.720
You must live!

44:35.800 --> 44:36.840
Please let go.

44:39.000 --> 44:41.240
No!

44:47.080 --> 44:49.160
All has been revealed now.

44:49.240 --> 44:52.360
You can either go or stay.
Do as you wish.

44:53.040 --> 44:55.960
But you won't find
a better place than this.

44:56.040 --> 44:57.600
Come. We're leaving.

45:12.360 --> 45:14.880
Give us our backpacks and my gun.

45:19.240 --> 45:20.480
What was in that syringe?

45:20.560 --> 45:21.480
Simone.

45:21.840 --> 45:22.960
You know something.

45:26.240 --> 45:28.040
You know something. Tell me!

45:31.000 --> 45:31.960
Did you know my dad?

45:32.040 --> 45:33.280
Frederik Andersen?

45:34.920 --> 45:35.760
Yes.

45:36.720 --> 45:37.840
We did it.

45:39.000 --> 45:40.600
We destroyed the world.

45:41.040 --> 45:43.520
But it will be better when...

45:44.360 --> 45:46.200
Let's go, Simone.

45:46.280 --> 45:48.320
We have to go, okay?

45:51.080 --> 45:52.360
Simone, come.

45:55.920 --> 45:57.080
You have to go now.

45:58.680 --> 46:01.200
What? No.

46:01.280 --> 46:04.640
You're stuck in the past.

46:06.200 --> 46:07.920
She has the right to know the truth.

46:09.280 --> 46:12.200
We have to stand by what we've done.

46:12.280 --> 46:13.160
Go now.

46:15.200 --> 46:16.040
Go.

46:17.400 --> 46:18.760
You're on your own now.

46:19.440 --> 46:21.160
You cannot leave me out here.

46:28.480 --> 46:29.800
What do we do now?

46:31.120 --> 46:35.760
I mean... you know best.
So, what's the plan, Martin?

46:41.040 --> 46:43.200
You want to know what's in the syringe?

46:43.280 --> 46:46.560
We thought we would save everyone
with this. Instead we killed them all.

46:47.600 --> 46:48.440
No!

47:09.000 --> 47:10.800
Let's get out of this fucking zone.

47:13.600 --> 47:15.520
But we'll stop by Apollon first.
