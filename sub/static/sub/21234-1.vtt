02:36.083 --> 02:37.415
Winston.

02:42.375 --> 02:43.616
Winston.

02:48.667 --> 02:49.999
Where were you?

02:52.083 --> 02:55.497
Beaches.. always bring it back.

02:57.875 --> 03:00.208
Almost 30 years have gone now.

03:03.875 --> 03:05.832
So many young men.

03:06.875 --> 03:10.039
So much... waste.

03:16.208 --> 03:17.790
It's getting late.

03:19.875 --> 03:21.036
Come on.

03:28.750 --> 03:31.333
I mustn't let it happen again.

04:16.516 --> 04:21.348
<i>Subtitled by Clarity.
Previo: Hownds</i>

04:53.667 --> 04:55.033
Winston.

05:08.875 --> 05:11.875
Winston.

05:13.042 --> 05:15.159
- Oh!
- Good God.

05:15.875 --> 05:17.116
Winston!

05:21.958 --> 05:24.792
- I was working.
- You're late.

05:26.542 --> 05:27.783
Burden.

05:29.667 --> 05:31.499
Burden.

05:32.042 --> 05:34.625
Give me a Louis XIII, Smuts.

05:36.417 --> 05:40.707
"For five years
we have asked our men,

05:40.917 --> 05:44.206
"to endure the tribulations of war."

05:44.417 --> 05:48.491
No, no, no...
"The trials of war."

05:48.708 --> 05:52.907
Yes. "For five years
we have asked our men,

05:53.167 --> 05:55.659
"to endure the trials of war."

05:56.208 --> 05:59.497
"Suffering of war."
Yeah, "sufferings of war".

06:00.908 --> 06:02.494
You are ready to go.

06:03.667 --> 06:06.034
Honestly, darling,
I think you will need these.

06:08.208 --> 06:10.450
- Knee-breeches.
- Weren't you allowed to wear the uniform?

06:10.667 --> 06:12.784
- The king will be there.
- Will so the Americans.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.323
His Majesty takes precedence,
even over them.

06:16.625 --> 06:18.241
That is the way it is done.

06:18.458 --> 06:21.371
Americans respect military uniforms.

06:22.625 --> 06:26.323
I am choosing between "trials"
and "tribulations".

06:26.542 --> 06:28.124
Do stop adding to them.

06:35.333 --> 06:37.416
This is all gonna go splendidly.

06:37.917 --> 06:40.751
The Cabinet Office has sent you
a new secretary.

06:40.958 --> 06:43.871
- Could you say hello?
- Why do I need a new secretary?

06:44.083 --> 06:46.120
Because you ate the last one.

06:47.542 --> 06:49.829
- Helen Garrett.
- My dear.

06:50.500 --> 06:53.868
Who's envy you to drop to the floor my dear?
I am not royalty.

06:54.208 --> 06:56.325
Sorry, I...
It's such a honor,

06:56.542 --> 06:58.408
To meet you, Mr. Churchill, sir.

06:59.083 --> 07:03.032
- My mother and I are huge supporters.
- Ah yes?

07:03.417 --> 07:07.582
Yes. Well, you are the one, sir.
The one who will see us through.

07:07.792 --> 07:09.408
You won't give up on us.

07:11.708 --> 07:17.955
My dear Miss Garrett,
that's why I fight on every day.

07:18.292 --> 07:23.162
And now I must go forth and do just that.

07:26.750 --> 07:30.414
- I'll try to reel him in.
- You can try.

07:31.500 --> 07:32.707
Miss Garrett.

07:52.208 --> 07:55.781
<i>"The sufferings of war."
No no no. No.</i>

07:56.000 --> 07:58.333
<i>"For five long years"</i>

07:58.542 --> 08:02.866
<i>"and our people have endured
the sufferings of war. "</i>

08:04.542 --> 08:09.287
<i>"The soldiers have born
their burden with pride."</i>

08:14.250 --> 08:18.494
<i>"The soldiers have born
their burden with valor."</i>

08:19.833 --> 08:21.790
Valor is better than pride.

08:30.792 --> 08:34.240
<i>"The soldiers have born
their burden with valor."</i>

08:36.167 --> 08:38.534
<i>"And pride."</i>

09:01.625 --> 09:02.866
Attention!

09:28.792 --> 09:31.159
- Here we go.
- Winston.

09:31.542 --> 09:33.158
General Eisenhower.

09:33.917 --> 09:35.328
Field Marshal Brooke.

09:35.667 --> 09:38.284
- General Montgomery.
- Mr. Churchill.

09:39.250 --> 09:40.786
What a gathering.

09:41.083 --> 09:42.745
Sorry to expose you to the English summer.

09:42.958 --> 09:45.325
- We couldn't risk this meeting in London.
- Just think,

09:45.542 --> 09:47.408
if Hitler were to drop a bomb
on this little patch

09:47.625 --> 09:49.102
he would at one blast...

09:49.296 --> 09:52.280
destroy the entire high command
of the our allied forces.

09:54.208 --> 09:55.824
Let's hope we get through it eh?

10:16.500 --> 10:17.616
Thank you.

10:20.208 --> 10:21.324
Sir.

10:26.375 --> 10:29.994
Majesty, gentlemen.
This is our last briefing on..

10:30.208 --> 10:32.575
Operation Overlord -
the assault on the German

10:32.792 --> 10:35.125
Occupying forces in the north of France.

10:35.792 --> 10:38.159
We have only a three day window,
before the tides change

10:38.375 --> 10:40.162
making it impossible to land our crafts.

10:40.333 --> 10:43.997
So it is a great throw of the dice.
But if we win the day,

10:44.708 --> 10:46.620
we'll go a long way toward,
winning the war.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.491
We are in final stages,

10:50.083 --> 10:53.906
but as usual I welcome
any criticism to this plan as it stands.

10:54.542 --> 10:56.454
We must all work together,
to pull this off.

10:58.542 --> 10:59.783
Prime Minister?

11:02.000 --> 11:05.719
This will be the greatest campaign

11:05.919 --> 11:08.497
yet mounted by our allied forces.

11:09.208 --> 11:12.280
Operation overlord
would require 200,000 vehicles,

11:12.500 --> 11:15.993
a fleet of 7,000 ships,
Swarms of planes..

11:16.208 --> 11:19.827
most essentially..
a quarter of a million men.

11:20.625 --> 11:24.448
All this, will be focused,
on one place.

11:25.417 --> 11:28.785
Taking the German army head on.

11:29.875 --> 11:33.789
- That's right.
- No, gentlemen, no.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.708
This plan may be admirable in its bravery.

11:36.917 --> 11:39.409
but in its risk it is
fool hearted.

11:39.958 --> 11:42.871
- Jesus Christ.
- Our own causality estimates predict

11:43.083 --> 11:46.497
that anything up to 160,000
French civilians will be killed.

11:47.583 --> 11:51.497
If overlord fails,
which would all too easily could..

11:52.250 --> 11:56.950
We will lose at one strike
most of our war material,

11:57.208 --> 12:00.167
along with tens of thousands
of our own men.

12:00.917 --> 12:04.035
Who then will defend England?

12:05.042 --> 12:08.535
Would you have us do nothing with the
Nazis amassing 20 miles off our shores?

12:08.792 --> 12:11.626
No! I would have us do more!

12:12.500 --> 12:15.618
We must split the advance,
to spread the risk.

12:15.833 --> 12:17.449
- Never.
- Don't you see?

12:18.083 --> 12:21.326
We could tempt
Hitler's forces into the Aegean..

12:21.542 --> 12:24.990
draw his eye away from the coasts of France.

12:25.208 --> 12:28.997
The plans for D-Day
have been in place for over a month.

12:33.667 --> 12:35.750
For five long years
we have asked our men,

12:35.958 --> 12:37.870
to endure the tribulations of war.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.663
They have born their burden
with valor.

12:42.417 --> 12:45.865
But I have seen
Beach landings such as this before

12:46.708 --> 12:47.869
in the first war.

12:49.042 --> 12:52.535
The potential for disaster is too great.

12:53.417 --> 12:56.956
We must not rush in.
We must think

12:57.250 --> 13:00.038
and we must fix this
broken plan,

13:00.250 --> 13:02.833
before it ends in tragedy.

13:08.792 --> 13:13.207
Well, that sounds rather if..

13:13.583 --> 13:17.122
we are discussing... different
Operations.

13:17.667 --> 13:20.159
Sir, Overlord has been fully prepared.

13:20.500 --> 13:22.708
I would be happy to send you a
detailed plan.

13:22.917 --> 13:25.159
Do that. Thank you.

13:26.917 --> 13:29.000
Excuse me,
Gentlemen, I have...

13:29.583 --> 13:31.540
another ship
to launch.

13:33.417 --> 13:34.703
Your Majesty.

13:46.083 --> 13:47.540
You haven't believed in this all along.

13:50.292 --> 13:53.831
Someone had to speak on behalf
of the ordinary fighting men.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.582
Brooke, could you ride with me?

14:01.958 --> 14:02.914
Bastard.

14:08.917 --> 14:13.491
- Why?
- Oh don't look so shocked smuts.

14:13.833 --> 14:15.699
I just saved the war.

14:32.917 --> 14:35.830
Winston, please.
We must discuss this.

14:36.042 --> 14:39.991
Quite right. We must start preparing
changes to the plan immediately.

14:42.083 --> 14:44.666
- No, wait!
- No time to wait.

14:44.875 --> 14:47.834
You can't just change everything
over the heads of our allies.

14:48.042 --> 14:51.740
I can! I can!
Weakness doesn't impress Americans.

14:51.958 --> 14:55.122
They respect strength.

14:55.292 --> 14:58.364
There is a difference
between strength and arrogance.

14:58.583 --> 15:00.870
Last time you British
tried to tell them what to do,

15:01.083 --> 15:03.166
- You lost the colonies.
- You forget Smuts,

15:03.333 --> 15:05.871
I am half an American myself.
My dear, late mother

15:06.083 --> 15:08.746
was native of Brooklyn,
New York! No less.

15:08.958 --> 15:11.871
They don't care about your mother.

15:14.958 --> 15:16.324
Good afternoon.

15:17.750 --> 15:21.164
We must draw up new plans.

15:21.417 --> 15:23.579
- Briggs, give me the admiral routine.
- Yes, sir.

15:23.792 --> 15:25.829
We must set up a distraction in the Aegean.

15:26.042 --> 15:29.365
Fanshawe, find out,
if General Alexander has reached Rome yet?

15:29.583 --> 15:32.166
He must keep driving the Nazis back.

15:32.333 --> 15:34.450
Miss Garrett,
get combined ops on the phone -

15:34.667 --> 15:37.034
someone there who knows about Norway.

15:37.250 --> 15:39.958
We must amass all our
resources.

15:40.208 --> 15:42.291
This is our chance.

15:42.542 --> 15:45.250
It is time,
to win this war.

15:46.542 --> 15:48.158
Have you finished
being rude about my mother?

15:48.333 --> 15:50.996
- Why are you doing this?
- D...

15:53.708 --> 15:55.995
D-Day will be a disaster, Smuts.

15:56.250 --> 15:57.991
Throwing all those men at one spot..

15:58.208 --> 16:01.042
on a well defended coast line,
teeming with Nazis,

16:01.458 --> 16:03.791
they would be slaughtered.
That's not warfare,

16:04.000 --> 16:07.289
It's butchering.
And I can't let them do that to our men.

16:07.500 --> 16:11.414
- Winston-
- Ah, Brookie, I'm glad you are back.

16:11.625 --> 16:14.413
We must talk about this
Plan for Bordeaux.

16:14.625 --> 16:18.574
- Eisenhower wants to see you.
- Good.. Good...

16:18.917 --> 16:22.615
I think of less formal wear, don't you?

16:28.917 --> 16:31.034
- I tried.
- We all have.

16:31.292 --> 16:32.530
You know that there comes a time when

16:32.725 --> 16:35.837
even the greatest of the leaders
has gone as far as he can go..

16:36.375 --> 16:37.582
Winston!

16:40.667 --> 16:42.124
Attention!

16:56.292 --> 16:58.033
Present arms!

17:03.667 --> 17:05.329
Follow me please, gentlemen.

17:07.916 --> 17:10.534
You will listen to Ike, won't you, Winston?

17:10.750 --> 17:13.367
Yeah, we will listen to each other.

17:14.375 --> 17:16.412
An exchange of views.

17:26.375 --> 17:27.491
Brooke.

17:28.708 --> 17:29.949
- Winston.
- Ike.

17:30.167 --> 17:32.375
I'm glad to see you..

17:32.583 --> 17:36.122
I hope we can talk about
the Bordeaux landing site plan.

17:37.500 --> 17:38.866
Why don't you seat down?

17:41.167 --> 17:43.875
That was hell of a speech today,
Winston, hell of a speech.

17:44.125 --> 17:45.866
Much needed to be said.

17:47.250 --> 17:51.665
- You should said some of it to me earlier.
- You said yourself "you welcome criticism."

17:52.667 --> 17:55.705
I do.
I welcome any thoughts on..

17:55.917 --> 17:59.206
how to increase
overlord's chances of success,

17:59.458 --> 18:02.075
decrease causalities,
short supply lines..

18:03.083 --> 18:06.076
But start talking about turning it
into a totally different operation,

18:06.542 --> 18:08.329
in front of the men
who have spent months planning it

18:08.500 --> 18:10.332
in front of the King of England, well...

18:13.375 --> 18:15.958
That could be seen as... unhelpful.

18:18.458 --> 18:20.074
Un helpful?

18:22.458 --> 18:25.781
you must remember Ike, we fought the Germans
and France before

18:26.042 --> 18:27.658
Even if you break through in Normandy

18:27.875 --> 18:31.448
even with the massive causalities
civilian and military

18:31.750 --> 18:34.163
what will our boys face in France?

18:35.417 --> 18:38.125
Another western front? Passchendaele?

18:38.333 --> 18:40.871
The Somme? Trench warfare!

18:41.125 --> 18:43.617
Winston, we have an air force.
We have self-propelled artillery,

18:43.833 --> 18:46.416
Armored divisions. The age of pushing
infantry to the front is over.

18:46.792 --> 18:50.035
Operation Overlord is not the
only way of winning this war.

18:50.667 --> 18:53.330
I should know, I have
seen a great many wars.

18:53.542 --> 18:56.501
Sure.
Some of them in the last century.

18:57.875 --> 19:00.333
- I beg your pardon?
- The war you are talking about,

19:00.500 --> 19:03.459
was 30 years ago.
I don't think you truly appreciate

19:03.667 --> 19:05.624
how much things have moved on...

19:07.417 --> 19:10.285
- What is this, Brookie?
- I think it's, Winston..

19:10.458 --> 19:15.283
We don't have the capacity,
to carry out these other plans of yours -

19:15.458 --> 19:18.701
Bordeaux, Italy or... anything else.

19:19.208 --> 19:21.495
All I'm trying to do is win this war.

19:21.708 --> 19:23.791
Is it? I think
you're trying to win the last war.

19:24.208 --> 19:25.824
With the same ideas
and tactics they had then.

19:26.083 --> 19:28.700
They were lessons
we learned in the last war.

19:29.042 --> 19:30.749
I don't want to make the same mistakes.

19:31.125 --> 19:32.922
- Of course.
- And I shall not be stopped..

19:33.017 --> 19:34.210
from speaking my mind.

19:34.417 --> 19:36.283
You are, of course, the Prime Minister.

19:36.500 --> 19:39.288
Which is exactly why we can't have you,
trying to disrupt things.

19:40.042 --> 19:42.785
I am imprecisely to disrupt it.

19:43.708 --> 19:47.031
The invasion of France
is a deadly gamble.

19:47.250 --> 19:48.536
and must be stopped!

19:48.750 --> 19:50.412
No, sir, you must be stopped!

19:50.625 --> 19:52.332
Look, we're all tired.

19:53.250 --> 19:55.993
You told me yourself, Winston.
You are no longer leaping out of your bed

19:56.208 --> 19:59.121
first thing in the morning,
rarely up before noon.

19:59.458 --> 20:03.202
Perhaps you should vouch your energies
to politics.,

20:03.375 --> 20:06.209
keeping the nation's morale,
that sort of thing.

20:06.417 --> 20:09.330
What? Am I to be a clown

20:09.708 --> 20:13.497
entertain the masses while you
send young men to the death?

20:13.708 --> 20:15.950
Winston, we're taking care of it.

20:16.167 --> 20:19.035
I have commissioned alternative plans,
from the forces.

20:19.250 --> 20:21.082
They should be here tomorrow, and then...

20:21.292 --> 20:25.115
The forces are not carrying out your plans.

20:29.708 --> 20:31.415
You counter mandate my orders?

20:36.833 --> 20:38.074
A-and...

20:39.750 --> 20:41.582
You both feel this?

20:42.667 --> 20:44.954
You need to let us do the job.

20:49.792 --> 20:54.833
Well, if you excuse me,
I must be on my way back to London.

20:55.083 --> 20:57.245
- I'll come with you.
- I rather you didn't.

20:58.375 --> 21:01.083
I have papers,
that I must look at in the car.

21:04.208 --> 21:05.324
Winston.

21:07.417 --> 21:10.160
Thank you for hearing what we had to say.

21:10.708 --> 21:12.825
You are great asset to this country,

21:13.083 --> 21:14.745
to this Ally war effort.
We all know that.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.707
Absolutely.

21:27.417 --> 21:28.749
I am fine.

21:30.292 --> 21:31.624
Very good, sir.

21:52.125 --> 21:57.701
Left, right, left, right,...

22:02.458 --> 22:03.574
Look!

22:24.125 --> 22:26.333
Left, right, left, right...

23:08.708 --> 23:11.496
That would be all.
Yes, thank you.

23:11.708 --> 23:13.244
Oh, Winston.

23:14.750 --> 23:16.616
I'm going to the Russell fund meeting.

23:17.667 --> 23:19.659
Margaret's holding a dinner afterwards.

23:21.833 --> 23:23.324
Ike spoke to you, didn't he?

23:26.417 --> 23:30.036
I ran this country and this
War for more than two years,

23:30.250 --> 23:33.163
before these Americans
even turned up.

23:33.375 --> 23:37.494
Yet,
as if my experience, my knowledge of warfare

23:37.708 --> 23:39.495
accounted for nothing..

23:39.792 --> 23:43.115
So Ike has a great deal of
Experience in warfare.

23:43.417 --> 23:44.999
Maybe you should listen to him.

23:45.208 --> 23:48.201
Is everyone to overrule everything I say?

23:48.625 --> 23:51.697
The king appointed me
Prime Minister of this country.

23:51.917 --> 23:55.490
And it's my duty,
to lead them through this war!

23:55.833 --> 23:59.247
Don't you see you aren't the only one
capable of making decisions?

24:04.667 --> 24:06.499
Is this about the war...

24:07.500 --> 24:09.537
or is it about you and me?

24:12.083 --> 24:16.327
- Do you want to be cuddled, Winston?
- I would settle for some respect.

24:16.833 --> 24:19.667
Then don't complain,
when someone tells you the truth.

24:22.292 --> 24:23.533
I'll be late.

24:42.375 --> 24:43.707
Bastards.

25:13.875 --> 25:15.366
Where is everybody?

25:16.875 --> 25:19.208
I should think
they're still at breakfast, sir.

25:22.750 --> 25:25.743
I'll be going to the coast today.
I shall need smuts.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.083
Miss Garrett,
take a telegram.

25:31.458 --> 25:32.619
Begins.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.788
To Halifax, British Embassy,
Washington DC.

25:37.042 --> 25:39.625
We celebrate success
of campaign in Italy.

25:39.833 --> 25:44.874
Pushing Nazis back.
Americans must now see need to slice up hard

25:45.125 --> 25:47.242
into soft under belly of Europe.

25:47.417 --> 25:49.955
The amphibious landings,
they plan for Normandy,

25:50.167 --> 25:53.456
must not become a distraction.
I hope you impress this on

25:53.667 --> 25:55.875
President when next you meet.

25:56.125 --> 25:59.664
Leaving him in no doubt,
of how a pro fervent enthusiasm

25:59.875 --> 26:02.993
for our American allies.
Ends.

26:04.917 --> 26:06.203
Give me Clop.

26:07.667 --> 26:10.284
Clop! Clop!

26:12.208 --> 26:13.369
Clop.

26:13.917 --> 26:15.078
Clop.

26:20.833 --> 26:22.074
Wow wow.

26:23.292 --> 26:25.705
- Oh. Wow wow.
- What are you doing?

26:26.333 --> 26:27.449
Working.

26:42.292 --> 26:45.080
The word I used was pro "fervent",

26:45.708 --> 26:50.078
Miss Garrett, meaning "intense".
According to your draft

26:50.292 --> 26:54.081
I would have our ambassador impress on
President Roosevelt

26:54.292 --> 26:56.705
my perverted enthusiasm..

26:56.917 --> 26:59.297
for our American
Allies.

27:05.282 --> 27:07.383
I'm terribly sorry.

27:07.583 --> 27:09.575
He had rather a tiring day yesterday.

27:09.792 --> 27:12.535
- And I don't take it's over.
- I'm fine.

27:13.250 --> 27:14.457
Good to hear.

27:19.792 --> 27:21.624
Oh was that necessary?

27:21.833 --> 27:23.995
I'm trying to run a country
and a war.

27:24.208 --> 27:25.870
I can't afford mistakes.

27:26.125 --> 27:28.162
- The car is ready, sir.
- Oh thank you, Briggs.

27:28.417 --> 27:31.865
- Why do you need your car?
- I am going inspect Monty's troops.

27:32.750 --> 27:34.662
Has he invited you?

27:35.375 --> 27:38.209
Clemmie, I may
only have a day,

27:38.375 --> 27:41.447
before they launched this show.
The least I can do,

27:41.667 --> 27:45.707
is to give some small words of encouragement
to those young men,

27:45.917 --> 27:48.455
they are sending to die on the beaches.

27:48.667 --> 27:52.741
And just remember win, They need
to respect their commanders.

27:53.000 --> 27:56.664
- That isn't your shooting party.
- I am only going to speak.

27:56.875 --> 27:58.867
That's rather what I am afraid of.

28:07.292 --> 28:11.161
No, it looks to me,

28:11.375 --> 28:13.867
that Monty has his numbers wrong.

28:14.625 --> 28:17.618
For all these vehicles
only this many men?

28:21.875 --> 28:24.834
- No, this is right.
- It's far too weak on infantry.

28:26.917 --> 28:28.783
He knows what he is doing.

28:29.625 --> 28:32.948
When you speak to his men,
to keep it short, will you?

28:34.042 --> 28:37.240
Perhaps you could say
something generous about him?

28:40.917 --> 28:42.525
I have had the good fortune

28:42.725 --> 28:46.694
to speak in public
on a few occasions before smuts.

28:47.333 --> 28:49.996
I should think,
I will manage this one.

29:47.833 --> 29:49.825
- Good afternoon gentlemen.
- Monty.

29:50.083 --> 29:52.575
Why don't we take a look around?

29:55.458 --> 29:58.576
- What bloody hell is going on?
- He means to inspect your troops.

29:58.792 --> 30:01.159
- They don't need inspecting.
- You tell him that.

30:01.375 --> 30:02.661
- All right.
- No, wait.

30:02.875 --> 30:05.492
- He needs to feel part of it.
- Oh for Christ sake.

30:05.708 --> 30:07.244
Most of the men have already shipped direct.

30:07.417 --> 30:10.785
Look, can you let him see a few maps

30:11.042 --> 30:14.490
Then I will be able to get him away.
I promise.

30:15.375 --> 30:18.573
- You are serious, aren't you?
- Please...

30:23.583 --> 30:26.326
Prime Minister, if you care to join me.
I'll show you the plans.

30:26.500 --> 30:27.741
Oh very good.

30:28.708 --> 30:34.033
The 21st Army Group is splitting to
landing points along the beaches.

30:34.542 --> 30:37.542
Seventh corps to Utah Beach here,
Fifth at Omaha,

30:39.417 --> 30:43.866
the 30th between gold and Juno,
the first Juno and Sword.

30:46.542 --> 30:47.999
How great is the whole distance of

30:48.208 --> 30:51.167
this coast line, Utah to Sword?

30:51.375 --> 30:52.991
About 50 miles.

30:55.500 --> 30:57.958
We must attack along the wider front.

30:59.042 --> 31:01.455
If you land them in
pocket such as this

31:01.667 --> 31:04.667
the men will be surrounded
instantly by Germans.

31:05.542 --> 31:07.283
They'll be we cut off, slaughtered.

31:07.500 --> 31:09.207
We have the advantage of surprise.

31:09.375 --> 31:11.492
What if they use poison gas on
our men?

31:11.708 --> 31:15.622
- We would retaliate.
- What? Well they could fire it from planes,

31:15.833 --> 31:17.244
** across villages.

31:17.417 --> 31:19.579
We would bomb the hell out them
and they know it.

31:19.833 --> 31:21.369
- Are you sure?
- I am so sure,

31:21.583 --> 31:23.540
I am not even letting
my men carry gas masks.

31:26.375 --> 31:27.707
Does he mean that?

31:28.000 --> 31:29.866
Well landing has been planned, Churchill.

31:30.250 --> 31:34.324
- That's the end of the matter, I insist.
- And who are you to insist?

31:34.542 --> 31:37.250
- Oh for Christ sake, Winston.
- Gentlemen, please.

31:37.708 --> 31:41.531
We have this chance!
only one chance,

31:41.750 --> 31:44.163
to drive the Nazis back
and liberate Paris!

31:44.375 --> 31:47.209
You will have beaches
chocked with the bodies of

31:47.375 --> 31:49.207
British and American
youths!

31:49.375 --> 31:51.207
We all know,
that warfare has consequences!

31:51.375 --> 31:55.619
Who cares when so many
human lives are at stake?

31:56.167 --> 31:59.581
have you not thought of the cost,
if we go

31:59.792 --> 32:02.034
Have you not thought
of the cost if we don't.

32:02.333 --> 32:05.952
This plan is for slaughter.

32:11.208 --> 32:13.040
The Germans are in position.

32:14.375 --> 32:16.332
They have reserves available.

32:17.333 --> 32:20.826
There will be obstacles,
minefields, unknown hazards.

32:21.083 --> 32:24.781
- Exactly.
- Then we must get the men seeing red.

32:25.792 --> 32:29.411
They must be completely on their toes
with absolute faith in the plan.

32:30.125 --> 32:34.665
No one must undermine their confidence,
including you.

32:36.708 --> 32:38.415
- What?
- I heard,

32:38.625 --> 32:41.038
what you said in front of the king and
our allies.

32:41.333 --> 32:43.825
I won't have you to speaking like that
to the men going to those beaches.

32:44.333 --> 32:46.791
I only want to boost up their courage!

32:47.042 --> 32:52.083
And yet the last time you spoke it was all
doubt, and treachery.

32:56.750 --> 33:00.448
- Did he say "treachery"?
- I'm sure he didn't mean that.

33:00.667 --> 33:03.501
That puffed up little shit!

33:04.792 --> 33:07.034
The men won't follow him.

33:15.167 --> 33:17.454
As you can see,

33:18.167 --> 33:20.705
today we have some important visitors,

33:21.500 --> 33:23.116
who can't wish you well.

33:26.583 --> 33:28.074
We're going soon.

33:29.625 --> 33:30.911
Very soon.

33:32.542 --> 33:34.283
You are young all of you.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.583
Many of you have
never been under fire.

33:39.125 --> 33:41.663
And you don't know,
what you are about to go through.

33:42.875 --> 33:45.709
Some of you are fearful.
That's natural.

33:47.042 --> 33:49.125
But, let's band together.

33:50.208 --> 33:54.452
look out for your brother in arms
and they will look out for you.

33:55.833 --> 33:57.995
So let's all get in there,

33:58.417 --> 34:01.581
shoot straight.
smash those bastards.

34:01.917 --> 34:04.660
- Yes sir!
- Get the job done.

34:04.875 --> 34:07.162
- And get back here.
- Let's do it, lads.

34:07.583 --> 34:09.290
And I want you all,
to remember one thing,

34:09.500 --> 34:13.915
as you land on those beaches.
What's your most important possession?

34:24.375 --> 34:26.583
- It's Your life.
- Yes! Yes, sir!

34:26.792 --> 34:29.864
- And I am gonna save it for you.
- Yes! Yes!

34:30.083 --> 34:34.327
- Oh yeah! What are we gonna do?
- Get Nazis out! Yeah!

34:34.542 --> 34:37.580
You and I together
will see this thing through!

34:37.833 --> 34:39.665
Yes! Yes, sir!

34:43.000 --> 34:44.866
Just Keep it short and polite.

34:45.292 --> 34:48.000
Whatever you do don't
insult anyone

34:48.208 --> 34:49.824
I won't speak.

34:50.625 --> 34:51.866
Won't?

34:52.125 --> 34:55.414
- He said all that's need to be said.
- Good luck.

34:59.042 --> 35:00.374
Well put sir.

35:02.833 --> 35:04.040
Thank you sir.

35:07.833 --> 35:10.416
I might take a stroll
into the beach.

35:11.750 --> 35:13.116
Only a minute.

36:00.667 --> 36:04.286
Winston, the car is ready!

36:26.208 --> 36:28.791
He is a gremial dog, that Monty.

36:29.333 --> 36:32.747
But I'd say one thing for him.
He's prepared to fight.

36:32.917 --> 36:35.910
He will go with those men.
He will see action.

36:36.167 --> 36:39.167
- Far too few of our leaders do.
- You did in the last war.

36:40.875 --> 36:42.411
The Western Front.

36:43.500 --> 36:47.540
After... after what happened
in the Turkish campaign.

36:49.500 --> 36:52.038
But it isn't right.
it isn't right,

36:52.417 --> 36:55.285
to set out the whole war
in an office in London.

36:55.500 --> 36:58.038
Sending thousands of soldiers
into gunfire

36:58.208 --> 37:00.325
- with the flourish of the pen.
- That's the job..

37:00.542 --> 37:03.455
- of a political leader.
- But Monty gets to be a real leader.

37:03.667 --> 37:06.580
I should be on those boats,
at the front with the men!

37:07.750 --> 37:10.037
Get there, even before Monty does.

37:10.542 --> 37:12.454
- I want to tell you a story.
- Must you?

37:12.708 --> 37:16.076
Yes. It's about the end
the Second Boer War,

37:16.333 --> 37:18.165
in which we both saw action.

37:18.667 --> 37:23.367
- Is there a point to this?
- 1902. We, Boer, set lost.

37:23.583 --> 37:25.620
And it felt to me
to meet your lord Kitchener

37:25.833 --> 37:29.406
..make peace.
The other commanders were furious.

37:29.625 --> 37:31.912
I was called a coward.
But I knew,

37:32.125 --> 37:36.165
that there was no glory for us
or for me in fighting on..

37:36.417 --> 37:38.830
- We would only damage ourselves..
- Smuts...

37:39.042 --> 37:44.367
Being a great leader
doesn't always mean seizing the glory.

37:44.750 --> 37:46.082
Sometimes you have to accept,

37:46.333 --> 37:48.950
that you cannot lead everything from
of the front.

37:50.583 --> 37:53.326
You and I are like
two old lovebirds,

37:53.542 --> 37:56.865
mooting together on a perch,
but still able to peck.

37:57.083 --> 37:59.621
- I'm not pecking.
- You are pecking..

38:01.417 --> 38:03.329
Eisenhower will listen to me.

38:04.125 --> 38:05.787
He is a man of reason,
a man of integrity.

38:05.958 --> 38:08.792
- A great man, I think.
- Winston, please.

38:09.583 --> 38:12.326
Don't add yourself to his problems.

38:23.625 --> 38:25.457
Well, I want to talk to him.

38:42.083 --> 38:43.824
Where is General Eisenhower?

39:02.750 --> 39:04.787
- Winston.
- Ike.

39:05.500 --> 39:07.537
Apologies for the short notice.

39:07.792 --> 39:10.660
I wanted to tell you
about my plans for D-Day.

39:12.208 --> 39:14.291
- Your plans?
- I have arranged a berth myself.

39:14.500 --> 39:17.459
- On HMS Belfast.
- This ship is sailing into battle.

39:17.667 --> 39:20.284
I know you and I haven't agreed on
all points of this operation,

39:20.500 --> 39:23.789
but surely we must agree on its importance.

39:24.125 --> 39:26.788
The men need to feel,
that the nation is with them.

39:26.958 --> 39:28.449
- So I shall go.
- Is this a joke?

39:28.667 --> 39:30.408
- Not in a million.
- But for Christ sake, you can't go.

39:30.625 --> 39:33.493
- Why not?
- Because if you get killed on one of my ships,

39:33.708 --> 39:36.496
- It's my responsibility.
- The HMS Belfast is not one of your ships.

39:36.708 --> 39:38.950
- She's one of the kings.
- Let's not split hairs.

39:39.167 --> 39:42.126
I have accepted you
as the supreme commander..

39:42.375 --> 39:45.413
of the British forces
involved in Overlord,

39:45.625 --> 39:48.493
but in the Navy there are 4 of our men
to every one of yours.

39:48.708 --> 39:50.324
- Christ, Winston...
- But you're an American general.

39:50.542 --> 39:53.330
You may not regulate
the compliments of British ships.

39:53.542 --> 39:55.625
I am not trying to regulate
your goddamn ships.

39:55.833 --> 39:58.416
- I am just telling you not to go.
- I'm the Prime Minister

39:58.625 --> 40:01.584
of the United Kingdom.
A minister of defense..

40:01.792 --> 40:04.330
I shall go,
where ever I consider it necessary,

40:04.542 --> 40:07.614
to the discharge of my duty!
You may not tie me down!

40:07.833 --> 40:09.950
- Tie you down?
- I've seen this before,

40:10.167 --> 40:15.037
in the first war. Big men,
fighting from the safety of their armchairs,

40:15.208 --> 40:19.122
..it's no good. Commanders must see
the battlefields for themselves.

40:19.375 --> 40:21.617
You're not a god damn commander!

40:22.000 --> 40:24.538
Is this about Montgomery? You just
trying' to get on the beaches before him?

40:24.833 --> 40:27.371
Of course not.
I didn't even thought of that.

40:27.583 --> 40:30.166
- What if you get shot?
- I've been in wars before.

40:30.417 --> 40:32.659
You are the sitting Prime Minister.
We can't risk your life.

40:33.583 --> 40:37.452
You are asking a quarter of a
young million men to risk their'.

40:37.667 --> 40:40.501
That's their job. It's not yours!

40:40.750 --> 40:46.075
If you want me.. to submit, to this...
unquestionably dangerous plan,

40:46.333 --> 40:49.167
the least you can do is let me,
lead my men into battle.

40:49.417 --> 40:52.160
I will not sit back in London
with my paws crossed.

40:52.417 --> 40:55.990
listening to them being mooned down
by German bullets from the wireless.

40:56.208 --> 40:58.791
I'll go with them.
I shall share their fate.

40:59.000 --> 41:01.959
Don't ask me host your
goddamn amateur theatrics!

41:02.792 --> 41:04.283
There is a war on!

41:05.208 --> 41:07.245
I am not asking you to host anything.

41:07.958 --> 41:11.656
I shall be travelling to France
as the King's Prime Minister,

41:11.833 --> 41:13.290
aboard the King's ship.

41:13.500 --> 41:16.163
And what's more, the
King will be coming with me.

41:16.417 --> 41:17.908
- What?
- His Majesty and I..

41:18.125 --> 41:21.111
..are in complete agreement.
We must be there..

41:21.375 --> 41:25.073
..to lead the men.
And there is nothing you or Monty

41:25.333 --> 41:26.824
can do about it.

41:41.625 --> 41:44.948
I need to speak to No. 10.
We're running out of time.

42:24.583 --> 42:28.702
Winston.
I've been looking for you everywhere.

42:29.458 --> 42:32.292
A man needs a
moment of quiet contemplation,

42:32.500 --> 42:33.832
before heading into battle.

42:34.917 --> 42:36.283
You must come.

42:37.917 --> 42:39.499
You have a visitor.

42:49.667 --> 42:51.033
Good evening, Winston.

42:52.167 --> 42:53.578
Your Majesty.

42:54.833 --> 42:58.326
I was told,
I might find you here.

43:00.208 --> 43:01.415
I had to..

43:03.208 --> 43:04.449
come over.

43:06.083 --> 43:09.622
It's about... the plan.

43:11.042 --> 43:12.624
to go on the..

43:16.083 --> 43:18.245
- the ship..
- Oh.

43:20.625 --> 43:21.911
We can't.

43:23.875 --> 43:27.111
- I see.
- I know I agreed when...

43:30.917 --> 43:34.081
when you telephoned earlier. It was...

43:35.000 --> 43:38.072
That was rash... of me.

43:40.000 --> 43:41.081
That...

43:42.042 --> 43:43.749
That changes often

43:45.500 --> 43:47.366
at this moment..

43:48.583 --> 43:53.328
could be a serious matter for the Empire.

43:55.833 --> 43:57.449
And Lilibet is...

43:58.875 --> 44:00.332
is only 18.

44:00.542 --> 44:04.536
Such a... determined girl,

44:04.833 --> 44:07.041
but still so very young.

44:09.500 --> 44:13.494
So, no, I... I can't go.

44:14.833 --> 44:16.870
And I don't need to say to you,

44:17.083 --> 44:20.997
what you'd mean for the allied

44:22.875 --> 44:26.323
cause if a chance..

44:27.833 --> 44:31.873
a bomb hit you...
remove you from the scene.

44:33.625 --> 44:37.869
Sir, it's...
it's all arranged.

44:38.708 --> 44:42.122
More over the risk is negligible.

44:42.542 --> 44:46.832
Our presence would be an embarrassment,
Winston.

44:48.833 --> 44:51.120
To those responsible..

44:53.750 --> 44:55.332
for the fighting.

44:58.708 --> 45:01.325
Whether we wanted it to be or not.

45:02.208 --> 45:06.953
The right thing to do,
is what normally

45:07.583 --> 45:12.032
falls to those at the top
on such occasions..

45:13.875 --> 45:15.537
to remain at home.

45:17.208 --> 45:18.619
And wait.

45:22.750 --> 45:26.414
I served in the last war,
as you do.

45:27.917 --> 45:30.785
Sailed a ship,
flew a plane.

45:31.000 --> 45:33.162
Bloody hell, that was exciting.

45:34.833 --> 45:37.041
I know this wields you sick.

45:42.833 --> 45:47.453
Everyone thinks they are the
most powerful man in the world.

45:48.833 --> 45:53.407
Until not allowed to do..
anything at all.

45:55.458 --> 46:00.783
My job...
is not to fight,

46:01.000 --> 46:03.583
not to die.

46:05.125 --> 46:09.745
I must...
exist.

46:11.458 --> 46:13.165
And be gracious..

46:15.000 --> 46:16.366
tonight.

46:17.792 --> 46:19.374
Bring hope.

46:22.333 --> 46:25.622
And that is my duty.

46:28.792 --> 46:31.375
And it is yours.. too.

46:38.625 --> 46:40.366
My duty.

46:41.708 --> 46:43.745
Go easy on Ike and Monty.

46:45.208 --> 46:47.791
You mustn't go into war, Winston.

46:50.208 --> 46:52.916
And you must not go to France.

46:59.792 --> 47:00.873
Well?

47:06.750 --> 47:11.290
Sir, you are my king.

47:12.542 --> 47:17.082
And I must do as you command.

47:26.208 --> 47:27.949
The anxiety..

47:29.000 --> 47:31.538
down the coming days would be..

47:32.083 --> 47:35.781
...greatly increased for me if..

47:37.083 --> 47:39.450
..in addition to everything else..

47:41.208 --> 47:46.283
well, was even the slightest risk,
of loosing you.

47:57.208 --> 48:00.701
Yeah. I must be off.

48:01.083 --> 48:02.949
They'll fight for **
if I don't get back soon.

48:08.167 --> 48:09.578
Good night, Winston.

48:18.750 --> 48:21.037
Britain will thank you for it, Winston.

48:23.083 --> 48:25.166
I believe all of us will.

48:26.500 --> 48:27.786
Forever.

48:30.833 --> 48:32.290
Majesty.

49:31.708 --> 49:35.122
- Did Ike send him?
- Ike asked me.

49:37.125 --> 49:38.536
I telephoned the palace.

49:45.833 --> 49:48.792
Why, Clemmie? Why?

49:50.333 --> 49:51.665
Couldn't you have talked to me?

49:53.792 --> 49:57.741
When was the last time..
did you actually listened to anybody?

50:00.000 --> 50:02.583
When was the last time that you sat
and had a conversation with me?

50:03.333 --> 50:07.532
Oh I am sorry. I must have been distracted
by this little matter,

50:07.750 --> 50:11.243
trying to win a war.
General Eisenhower sends his wife

50:11.458 --> 50:15.156
long letters every weekend,
even though he's thousands of miles away.

50:15.750 --> 50:18.663
Why don't you marry General Eisenhower?

50:18.833 --> 50:21.075
Perhaps some younger men,
still in his prime.

50:21.333 --> 50:24.531
who everybody seems
to think is a real war hero.

50:24.958 --> 50:28.406
Not some clapped up,
moth-eaten old lions,

50:28.625 --> 50:31.459
whose teeth have been pulled,
so he's not to frighten the ladies.

50:33.958 --> 50:35.790
Try acting like a
Hero, Winston.

50:36.000 --> 50:38.913
And then maybe people will believe
that you are one again.

50:40.875 --> 50:43.709
Why don't you just have me stuffed?

51:52.958 --> 51:54.449
Please take your seats.

52:04.750 --> 52:07.493
Gentlemen, we are here
at this unsocial hour,

52:07.667 --> 52:10.080
to make the greatest decision
of our lives.

52:11.000 --> 52:13.583
The Armada of overlord has began to sail.

52:13.917 --> 52:17.285
This is the last moment,
the last, crucial moment,

52:17.583 --> 52:21.748
in which we must decide whether this
Operation proceed today as planned.

52:23.583 --> 52:25.870
Of course we must consider the
conditions,

52:26.583 --> 52:28.916
wind, rain, tides.

52:30.792 --> 52:34.490
So let's have report.
Troop Captain Stagg, the weather.

52:38.333 --> 52:41.451
Gentlemen, the fears
my colleagues and I have had

52:41.667 --> 52:45.786
with the weather over the next three
or four days have been confirmed.

52:47.000 --> 52:50.619
The sea will be rough.
Winds up to four six.

52:50.833 --> 52:52.620
A lot of low clouds.

52:53.125 --> 52:55.082
We have had a report
from the West Irish station,

52:55.333 --> 52:58.167
that their barometer
is falling rapidly there.

52:58.667 --> 53:00.829
A further depression is heading our way.

53:01.667 --> 53:05.707
Eh-I'm sorry, sir.
It's not a good picture.

53:06.958 --> 53:09.291
General Montgomery,
what do you recommend?

53:11.208 --> 53:13.165
We are there nearly out of time.

53:13.875 --> 53:15.741
I think we must launch now.

53:17.458 --> 53:20.872
- Air chief Marshall?
- I'm afraid I disagree.

53:21.500 --> 53:23.913
These are terrible
conditions for air support.

53:24.625 --> 53:26.332
I don't know how much
I can provide in this weather.

53:26.542 --> 53:28.033
But it won't be much.

53:35.000 --> 53:36.536
Admiral, what do you think?

53:37.583 --> 53:39.575
It's dreadful. I think we must consider

53:39.750 --> 53:43.448
how feasible it is,
to land craft in a storm.

53:43.667 --> 53:46.205
Damn it, Ike. My men
have already sailed.

53:46.875 --> 53:49.037
Admiral, how long do we have,
before the ships will have gone too far,

53:49.250 --> 53:50.582
to call them back?

53:51.125 --> 53:53.492
Perhaps 30 minutes.

53:57.833 --> 54:01.281
There could be another chance
tomorrow. Stagg?

54:02.250 --> 54:07.075
Sir, there may be a short break
in the storms tomorrow morning.

54:07.333 --> 54:10.952
But for the next 24 hours
it will be very hard to say.

54:14.667 --> 54:16.750
Which risk do you prefer to take?

54:33.875 --> 54:35.207
Call them back.

54:36.958 --> 54:38.995
We meet back here tomorrow
at the same time.

54:39.208 --> 54:41.871
Until then pray for good weather.

54:45.750 --> 54:48.948
Ike. You call them back.

54:50.667 --> 54:53.284
This hasn't been planned
with any alternatives.

54:53.500 --> 54:56.117
It has been planned as a victory,
that's what it's going to be.

54:56.375 --> 54:57.323
We are going down there,

54:57.886 --> 55:01.037
we're gonna throw everything we have at it,
and make it a success.

55:01.792 --> 55:04.580
Because frankly,
if we don't win this,

55:04.750 --> 55:07.288
I don't know what kind of
World we will be left with.

55:07.500 --> 55:09.537
I wouldn't disagree with you there.

55:11.208 --> 55:12.665
<i>- Thank you.
- Thank you sir.</i>

55:17.958 --> 55:21.372
Till there tomorrow, Churchill.
You can't stop it.

55:21.958 --> 55:23.074
No.

55:24.625 --> 55:26.207
But the weather might.

55:43.625 --> 55:45.211
Brooke is here to bring you up to date,

55:45.311 --> 55:47.108
with everything that has been
happening on the coast.

55:48.083 --> 55:49.745
The General Alexander's forces,

55:49.958 --> 55:52.200
who yesterday took Rome from the Nazi,

55:52.458 --> 55:55.292
shall today go into the greatest
Battle of the war.

55:55.500 --> 55:57.617
The Italian campaign could win it.

55:57.792 --> 56:00.956
The Supreme allied command
is focusing its hope and attention now..

56:01.167 --> 56:04.456
- ...on Operation Overlord.
- There is very little I can do about Overlord..

56:04.750 --> 56:09.040
I have to direct my efforts,
to winning the rest of this war.

56:10.458 --> 56:13.781
I feel like a man chained to the
chariot of a lunatic.

56:14.000 --> 56:16.913
If we can just make him feel part of it.

56:17.167 --> 56:19.124
The political fellows
are worried about him too!

56:19.375 --> 56:23.289
With the war ends this year, they're saying
he could be a liability as a leader.

56:23.667 --> 56:25.408
Now I know you're fond of him, Smuts.

56:25.625 --> 56:27.662
And so am I,
believe it or not,

56:28.000 --> 56:30.458
But he's testing the limits.

56:30.667 --> 56:34.206
- He's not the man he was.
- When you reach calm waters,

56:34.458 --> 56:38.577
it is easy to forget the captain,
who steered you through the storm.

56:38.750 --> 56:41.538
I haven't forgotten
how great he was in the Blitz,

56:41.708 --> 56:45.201
- But that was four years ago.
- He's still a great man.

56:45.458 --> 56:49.873
End. Bloody fool.
You are all bloody fools.

56:50.167 --> 56:52.750
This is single spaced!
Why is it single spaced?

56:53.083 --> 56:55.075
I'm sorry sir.
Someone must have reset the typewriter.

56:55.333 --> 56:56.619
Well, it must be double spaced.

56:58.667 --> 57:01.410
Why do you waste my time?
You stupid girl!

57:01.625 --> 57:04.868
- I'm sorry, I didn't know.
- Do you realize what I have to do?

57:05.833 --> 57:08.621
I must look after the troops,
keep them safe!

57:08.833 --> 57:12.827
Food, shelter, equipment.
All must be organized!

57:15.958 --> 57:19.622
they will probably send dental chairs
instead of bayonets.

57:19.833 --> 57:24.498
I must focus.
You must focus.

57:24.667 --> 57:25.908
Winston?

57:26.917 --> 57:29.034
Would you come with me for a moment please?

57:48.917 --> 57:50.704
A great man.

57:52.833 --> 57:56.577
I cannot work
if I am surrounded by such incompetence.

57:57.417 --> 58:01.286
I'll show Brooke and Monty,
what it takes to be a real general.

58:01.542 --> 58:04.410
I will show them,
how great men win their wars.

58:04.625 --> 58:07.208
Stop it! Just stop it!

58:08.458 --> 58:11.041
Brooke and Eisenhower and
Monty are fighting this war..

58:11.250 --> 58:12.786
and you just keep getting in their way.

58:13.042 --> 58:15.625
- I am Prime Minister of this country!
- Exactly.

58:15.833 --> 58:18.450
- And minister of defense!
- Don't pull rank,

58:18.667 --> 58:20.283
makes you seem small.

58:21.583 --> 58:23.449
And you don't need any more of that.

58:25.208 --> 58:27.916
Will you stop telling me what to do?

58:29.958 --> 58:31.620
I beg your pardon?

58:40.208 --> 58:42.621
Perhaps it's time
I took some rest.

58:46.250 --> 58:47.616
I would say so.

01:00:08.875 --> 01:00:10.411
Dear God.

01:00:14.208 --> 01:00:15.574
Oh dear..

01:00:23.625 --> 01:00:29.496
Please, please, please,
let it rain tomorrow.

01:00:30.583 --> 01:00:32.370
Let it pour.

01:00:33.667 --> 01:00:37.741
Let the heavens open..
and a deluge burst for

01:00:37.958 --> 01:00:42.407
Such as never have been seen
at the English channel.

01:00:44.167 --> 01:00:46.204
Let lightening flash,

01:00:47.083 --> 01:00:50.576
Let thunder crash and roll
and bellow

01:00:52.208 --> 01:00:55.497
let winds tear up the beaches..

01:00:55.667 --> 01:00:59.832
and spin the sand into storms.

01:01:01.750 --> 01:01:07.371
Let the sea churns into peaks and troughs
and tidal waves.

01:01:08.458 --> 01:01:12.873
Call spirits from the vastly deep..

01:01:20.917 --> 01:01:22.078
Please.

01:01:24.917 --> 01:01:26.829
Make them call it off

01:01:29.833 --> 01:01:34.453
and spare the lives of all those fine
young men on those ships.

01:01:35.875 --> 01:01:36.956
Please.

01:01:38.625 --> 01:01:41.038
Do not let it happen again.

01:02:02.417 --> 01:02:03.533
Amen.

01:02:15.708 --> 01:02:16.869
Amen.

01:03:21.167 --> 01:03:23.784
Thank you for coming again.
Take your seats.

01:03:30.708 --> 01:03:31.994
The weather, please.

01:03:35.833 --> 01:03:40.203
Yesterday we predicted that there would
be a short break in the storms this morning.

01:03:40.708 --> 01:03:43.746
As of 0400 that holds good.

01:03:45.667 --> 01:03:48.705
The cloud cover
2,000 feet stands at 3 tenths,

01:03:49.083 --> 01:03:52.576
the wind is between
force three and force four.

01:03:54.125 --> 01:03:56.617
You would have a big celebration
if that forecast is accurate.

01:03:56.833 --> 01:03:59.291
These conditions could actually work
against the Germans.

01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:01.992
They won't be able to get their
reconnaissance planes up at all.

01:04:02.625 --> 01:04:04.412
Can the navy gunners
spot in this visibility?

01:04:04.875 --> 01:04:06.662
- Yes.
- Monty?

01:04:07.417 --> 01:04:09.033
The army is ready.

01:04:24.875 --> 01:04:26.616
It's a hell of a risk.

01:04:28.417 --> 01:04:30.579
But it's the best possible gamble.

01:04:37.625 --> 01:04:38.701
The question is how long can you..

01:04:39.001 --> 01:04:41.287
...leave something like this
hanging out there on a limb?

01:04:57.417 --> 01:04:58.828
Okay, let's go.

01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:12.868
Troop Capt. Stagg.
photograph, if you please.

01:05:17.833 --> 01:05:18.914
Thank you.

01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:00.581
Ike.

01:06:02.625 --> 01:06:06.619
You have said that this war
is not like the last war.

01:06:07.417 --> 01:06:11.115
But this operation..

01:06:12.125 --> 01:06:13.741
very much is.

01:06:18.417 --> 01:06:20.625
Men will die tomorrow.

01:06:22.208 --> 01:06:28.739
Do not let a single one of them die in vain.

01:06:37.458 --> 01:06:38.949
God speed!

01:08:15.583 --> 01:08:16.993
They'll go in.

01:08:46.707 --> 01:08:48.791
- Holy shit!
- Winston!

01:08:52.625 --> 01:08:55.618
- I can't obey this..
- For goodness sake.

01:08:55.832 --> 01:08:57.040
I can't..

01:08:58.125 --> 01:09:01.618
- I will not tolerate this from you.
- I can't lead this.

01:09:02.207 --> 01:09:05.167
- It's murder!
- Sit down.

01:09:05.417 --> 01:09:10.037
I will not be able to live the rest
of my if with this on my conscience.

01:09:10.667 --> 01:09:12.203
You have no choice.

01:09:13.250 --> 01:09:14.370
Do you hear me?

01:09:14.694 --> 01:09:17.808
I will not be able to live
the rest of my life..

01:09:18.008 --> 01:09:19.411
Is that a threat?

01:09:20.250 --> 01:09:22.457
By the time we wake tomorrow,

01:09:23.167 --> 01:09:26.786
20,000 young men...
may be dead.

01:09:35.957 --> 01:09:37.290
You're drunk.

01:09:38.917 --> 01:09:41.910
This is the only thing,
that brings me peace.

01:09:43.042 --> 01:09:46.001
Well, it's not working.
You should be ashamed of yourself.

01:10:12.417 --> 01:10:14.374
Yes, could you send the maid up
to the breakfast room please?

01:10:14.583 --> 01:10:16.370
There has been an accident.

01:10:17.125 --> 01:10:20.493
No, everyone is fine.
Just a broken plate.

01:10:21.417 --> 01:10:22.828
Yes thank you.

01:10:23.208 --> 01:10:27.157
And could you tell Field marshall Smuts,
I would like to see him. Thank you.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:09.207
How is he?

01:11:11.125 --> 01:11:12.241
Come on.

01:11:28.375 --> 01:11:29.661
Winston?

01:11:32.667 --> 01:11:33.908
Winston.

01:11:36.750 --> 01:11:39.208
The ships are gathering in the channel.

01:11:39.750 --> 01:11:42.413
They set sail at 1700 hours.

01:11:43.708 --> 01:11:47.452
I thought I could help you,
prepare your speeches for tomorrow.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:06.000
- This has happened before?
- A few times.

01:12:06.958 --> 01:12:11.373
He gets very low and then he just sticks.

01:12:11.875 --> 01:12:14.500
And anything you try to say to cheer him up
just seems to make matters worse.

01:12:14.700 --> 01:12:17.325
- Have you called for his doctor?
- His doctor usually just sends him

01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:19.082
to the country for a couple of weeks.

01:12:19.292 --> 01:12:22.364
- He has to address the nation tomorrow.
- I know.

01:12:22.917 --> 01:12:24.658
Either to tell them that
we're winning the war.

01:12:24.875 --> 01:12:28.539
...or that we have just killed
thousands of people needlessly.

01:12:30.250 --> 01:12:31.536
Oh, dear.

01:12:33.250 --> 01:12:34.991
Oh dear, oh dear.

01:12:36.833 --> 01:12:39.826
- Are you all right?
- Yes of course.

01:12:40.833 --> 01:12:42.825
It must be hard for you too.

01:12:47.083 --> 01:12:48.870
I wish he'd notice that.

01:12:51.292 --> 01:12:53.534
Anyway, we must do our best I suppose.

01:12:53.792 --> 01:12:56.500
Why don't you let me talk to him.

01:13:31.750 --> 01:13:33.286
I thought, if we came at this together,

01:13:33.458 --> 01:13:36.326
we could all help write
your speech for tomorrow.

01:13:38.750 --> 01:13:43.074
It's a very important speech, Winston.
Perhaps if you focus on that,

01:13:43.292 --> 01:13:46.035
you will be able to summon the energy.

01:13:48.750 --> 01:13:50.912
How shall we begin, Miss Garrett?

01:13:51.833 --> 01:13:56.624
Uh... ah!
"This is the Prime Minister."

01:13:58.750 --> 01:14:01.709
"Overnight the combined allied forces "

01:14:01.917 --> 01:14:05.615
"of air, sea and land
began a full assault "

01:14:05.833 --> 01:14:09.952
"on the German positions on
the north coast of France. "

01:14:10.542 --> 01:14:14.832
"This is the beginning of the
greatest operation of war. "

01:14:15.042 --> 01:14:20.037
"It will push the Nazis back
and liberate France. "

01:14:20.833 --> 01:14:25.749
"Thousands of brave young men
have landed from a fleet of ships. "

01:14:25.958 --> 01:14:30.532
"They have secured the beaches and
pushed the German lines back. "

01:14:31.125 --> 01:14:33.788
- You don't know that.
- What?

01:14:35.750 --> 01:14:38.333
It's all too familiar, Smuts.

01:14:40.042 --> 01:14:41.874
I've seen this before.

01:14:43.250 --> 01:14:46.994
Gallipoli... 1915th

01:14:47.792 --> 01:14:49.749
Massive amphibious landing.

01:14:50.917 --> 01:14:54.706
A head on assault against
a powerfully entrenched army.

01:14:56.542 --> 01:15:00.365
We had great plans,
for the first Kitchener and I.

01:15:00.583 --> 01:15:04.202
- This isn't 1915!
- But the operation was cut back,

01:15:04.417 --> 01:15:07.740
petty minded little..
snipings of the commanders.

01:15:08.250 --> 01:15:12.540
"Loose a dozen ships here.
Don't send extra divisions. "

01:15:12.792 --> 01:15:15.159
"They needn't have so many high explosives."

01:15:18.042 --> 01:15:22.207
I tried to stop it.
Oh, God knows I tried.

01:15:27.083 --> 01:15:28.540
It was meant...

01:15:31.125 --> 01:15:33.287
It was meant to be...

01:15:36.292 --> 01:15:38.329
a little job.

01:15:46.833 --> 01:15:50.372
We may as well have sent those men
naked on to those beaches.

01:15:50.583 --> 01:15:54.031
Warfare has moved on.
Your lessons have been learnt.

01:15:54.250 --> 01:15:57.869
A quarter of a million men were
cut down at Gallipoli.

01:15:59.125 --> 01:16:03.620
The Empire blamed me.
I was its champion.

01:16:04.667 --> 01:16:08.490
But no one blames
me more fiercely than I blame myself.

01:16:08.750 --> 01:16:12.323
If that had succeeded,
you would have been celebrated as a hero.

01:16:12.500 --> 01:16:14.116
But it failed!

01:16:17.167 --> 01:16:22.242
I sent men to die!
Hundreds, thousands of them!

01:16:24.042 --> 01:16:26.534
Their blood soaks my hands.

01:16:26.792 --> 01:16:30.206
The men do their
duty and we do ours.

01:16:30.417 --> 01:16:33.831
- We must live with the guilt.
- But we live,

01:16:34.792 --> 01:16:37.079
and still the commanders have not learned.

01:16:37.667 --> 01:16:39.954
For they do not care to learn..

01:16:40.167 --> 01:16:43.956
They keep away from the battlefield
and do not see the cost.

01:16:44.167 --> 01:16:46.625
Eyes, shot out by snipers bullets..

01:16:47.042 --> 01:16:50.001
legs blown up by mines,
Blood on the sea foam.

01:16:50.500 --> 01:16:53.823
That's what the men see.
That's what they face.

01:16:54.708 --> 01:16:58.702
Half of those men on those ships
today will be rotting corpses by tomorrow.

01:16:58.917 --> 01:17:00.283
That's enough!

01:17:01.208 --> 01:17:03.450
My fiancé is on
one of those ships.

01:17:07.083 --> 01:17:10.155
I think he is.
He can't tell me exactly.

01:17:15.250 --> 01:17:16.786
What's his rank?

01:17:21.417 --> 01:17:23.124
He is a midshipman.

01:17:24.083 --> 01:17:25.619
On a destroyer.

01:17:29.042 --> 01:17:32.285
Arthur..
Arthur Clayton.

01:17:43.875 --> 01:17:45.741
How did you meet?

01:17:49.417 --> 01:17:51.249
We grew up together in
Portsmouth.

01:17:55.333 --> 01:17:57.450
He says that
he'll take care of me and my mother.

01:17:59.583 --> 01:18:01.791
My father was in the first war.

01:18:02.833 --> 01:18:07.157
That still with him.
He's not much good work.

01:18:10.667 --> 01:18:14.286
Arthur says when he returns
we'll get a cottage by the sea.

01:18:15.875 --> 01:18:20.370
Fill it with children...
grow roses around the door.

01:18:21.958 --> 01:18:26.749
I want to believe that I won't end up
like my mother and her sisters.

01:18:26.958 --> 01:18:30.702
With all their men dead,
or maimed, or shell shocked.

01:18:31.875 --> 01:18:34.663
I want to believe,
that he will just be alright.

01:18:35.292 --> 01:18:37.830
That he'll just be alright.

01:18:38.708 --> 01:18:40.950
I don't want to hear,
that the man I love,

01:18:41.167 --> 01:18:43.204
may in a few hours be dead.

01:18:46.333 --> 01:18:48.290
And I don't want to hear it from you.

01:18:54.250 --> 01:18:56.833
I thought that you were
the bravest man in England.

01:19:03.167 --> 01:19:06.167
I'm sorry.
I have no right.

01:19:06.500 --> 01:19:07.741
No.

01:19:11.833 --> 01:19:15.702
You...
have every right.

01:19:21.125 --> 01:19:23.833
Come.
Sit down.

01:19:29.875 --> 01:19:31.116
Thank you.

01:19:40.417 --> 01:19:43.417
I must get dressed.

01:20:26.292 --> 01:20:27.999
I need your help.

01:20:29.292 --> 01:20:31.033
What are you talking about?

01:20:32.250 --> 01:20:33.411
Duty.

01:20:41.708 --> 01:20:43.495
Ar.. Are you going?

01:20:46.042 --> 01:20:47.624
I can't.. can I?

01:20:52.792 --> 01:20:56.832
I know I haven't been fully companion to you

01:20:57.708 --> 01:21:00.133
for some while.

01:21:00.333 --> 01:21:03.952
This war requires the whole of me.

01:21:04.542 --> 01:21:08.456
And it's no easy matter,
being a leader.

01:21:09.667 --> 01:21:12.375
It's not that easy,
being married to one either.

01:21:13.750 --> 01:21:17.915
I expected to stand behind you
and prop you up whenever you required -

01:21:18.750 --> 01:21:22.744
with good humor and
unfailing kindness.

01:21:25.417 --> 01:21:27.909
I sometimes wish,
I could live my own life.

01:21:30.083 --> 01:21:31.540
Would you do that?

01:21:33.458 --> 01:21:36.201
I've had to learn,
to live around your edges.

01:21:48.917 --> 01:21:50.624
I often wondered,

01:21:51.417 --> 01:21:54.285
if there would be another man.

01:21:55.833 --> 01:21:58.905
- Would you care if there were?
- Desperately..

01:22:02.958 --> 01:22:05.200
I haven't made you
happy, have I?

01:22:06.833 --> 01:22:09.383
You have.

01:22:09.583 --> 01:22:11.449
At times you really have..

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:14.286
But now...

01:22:15.458 --> 01:22:18.656
Win, I don't know how to help you

01:22:18.875 --> 01:22:22.448
if... if you don't understand,
what it is you must to do.

01:22:30.619 --> 01:22:31.948
We shouldn't keep them waiting.

01:22:34.208 --> 01:22:37.747
No. No, I... I'll go ahead.

01:22:52.917 --> 01:22:54.283
- Briggs.
- Sir.

01:22:54.458 --> 01:22:56.620
Did you get any word
back from the admiralty?

01:22:56.833 --> 01:23:00.952
Yes, sir. Midshipman Arthur Clayton is
on one of the craft heading for Juno beach.

01:23:02.333 --> 01:23:04.074
They are at the first wave.

01:23:04.500 --> 01:23:08.198
Expecting a lot of German fire, sir.
I'm sorry.

01:23:09.708 --> 01:23:11.449
- Thank you, Briggs.
- Sir.

01:23:14.417 --> 01:23:16.659
They will be well on their way by now.

01:23:18.333 --> 01:23:20.245
So many young men.

01:23:21.417 --> 01:23:25.491
Same as in the last war.
Barely more than boys.

01:23:26.792 --> 01:23:28.533
They have grown up with this war.

01:23:29.333 --> 01:23:30.744
They are brave.

01:23:31.875 --> 01:23:34.458
Too young to know how to be afraid.

01:23:38.042 --> 01:23:40.159
What will you say tomorrow?

01:23:42.542 --> 01:23:45.740
I don't know.
Depends on the news.

01:23:46.375 --> 01:23:47.991
No it doesn't.

01:23:49.167 --> 01:23:51.910
Whatever happens tonight,
you must give them hope.

01:23:53.042 --> 01:23:57.787
Even if 20,000 men are dead,
you can't lead their wives and mothers

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.913
and children thinking,
they have died for no reason.

01:24:01.583 --> 01:24:05.657
You must stand with them,
make their sacrifice have a purpose.

01:24:06.375 --> 01:24:11.621
Make them believe that by God,
they will win this war.

01:24:14.417 --> 01:24:16.409
And I'll do it with them.

01:24:18.208 --> 01:24:19.449
For that is my duty.

01:24:21.500 --> 01:24:22.786
Isn't it?

01:24:26.417 --> 01:24:30.081
Would you mind talking to the
woman secretary without me?

01:24:31.667 --> 01:24:33.784
I must write that speech.

01:24:37.792 --> 01:24:38.908
Clem?

01:24:44.375 --> 01:24:46.867
Fighting is what I have always done..

01:24:47.958 --> 01:24:50.792
It's the core of who I am.

01:24:51.792 --> 01:24:54.864
If I do this,
if I make this speech,

01:24:55.083 --> 01:24:56.745
I won't be fighting any more.

01:24:58.250 --> 01:24:59.661
No, you won't.

01:25:03.792 --> 01:25:05.374
Who will I be,

01:25:07.208 --> 01:25:08.824
when it's all over?

01:25:10.542 --> 01:25:14.035
If we win or it
ends in disaster?

01:25:16.958 --> 01:25:21.328
What will I be,
if I'm no longer fighting?

01:25:24.292 --> 01:25:28.115
You will always be the man,
who let us through this.

01:25:35.708 --> 01:25:38.325
- Wow, wow.
- Wow, wow.

01:25:51.167 --> 01:25:52.453
Miss Garrett!

01:26:16.167 --> 01:26:17.283
Sir.

01:26:23.833 --> 01:26:26.166
Very good, Miss Garrett.
Thank you.

01:26:27.417 --> 01:26:29.909
Winston, news has just come through.

01:26:30.125 --> 01:26:31.957
- The landings?
- No, London.

01:26:32.167 --> 01:26:34.375
We think the Luftwaffe
will strike the new V-rockets.

01:26:34.583 --> 01:26:36.700
We should
prepare the air aid shelter.

01:26:37.083 --> 01:26:39.200
Do we have the planes
to shoot them down?

01:26:39.417 --> 01:26:42.205
We will try,
but these rockets have no pilots.

01:26:42.417 --> 01:26:43.874
Incredibly fast.

01:26:44.667 --> 01:26:47.865
If Hitler thinks,
he can break our spirit like this,

01:26:48.167 --> 01:26:50.534
he is wrong. Miss Garrett,

01:26:51.792 --> 01:26:54.284
I shall need another draft of that speech.

01:26:54.458 --> 01:26:56.370
Oh, and by the way...

01:27:00.208 --> 01:27:01.744
Thank you, Smuts.

01:27:09.458 --> 01:27:14.328
I have received this report on
Midshipman Arthur Clayton.

01:27:14.958 --> 01:27:18.907
<i>He landed with the first wave.
They took heavy fire,</i>

01:27:19.125 --> 01:27:23.324
<i>but he himself fought with great
courage and saw it through.</i>

01:27:23.500 --> 01:27:25.958
<i>He is safe and well.</i>

01:27:27.458 --> 01:27:29.165
Oh heavens..

01:27:30.208 --> 01:27:34.122
Oh, and if I may...

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.083
He sends you his love.

01:27:44.958 --> 01:27:47.792
Thank you.. so very much,
Mr. Churchill.

01:27:52.875 --> 01:27:55.413
Thank you, Miss Garrett.

01:29:32.625 --> 01:29:35.038
This is the Prime Minister speaking.

01:29:35.875 --> 01:29:40.540
<i>First the news from the
great operation in France.</i>

01:29:41.333 --> 01:29:47.204
<i>This magnificent effort of co-ordinated
air, land and sea...</i>

01:29:47.750 --> 01:29:52.040
..has brought the allied forces together
to push the Nazis back

01:29:52.292 --> 01:29:55.785
and begin the liberation
of France.

01:29:56.458 --> 01:30:00.202
The passage of the sea
has been made with far less loss..

01:30:00.417 --> 01:30:03.706
than we apprehended.
The superior bombardment

01:30:03.917 --> 01:30:09.037
our ships and planes
quickly reduced the German fire.

01:30:10.542 --> 01:30:15.913
<i>General Eisenhower's courage
is equal to all that must be done.</i>

01:30:16.708 --> 01:30:22.079
<i>Everything is ready,
as it has never been ready before,</i>

01:30:22.542 --> 01:30:27.207
and we are awake
to the tips of our fingers.

01:30:27.542 --> 01:30:28.908
It's a good line.

01:30:29.625 --> 01:30:33.539
<i>Last night the dangers appeared very great..</i>

01:30:33.792 --> 01:30:36.792
<i>This morning we have overcome them.</i>

01:30:38.250 --> 01:30:41.698
This great war against
Nazi domination..

01:30:42.333 --> 01:30:45.041
<i>is fought by ordinary people,</i>

01:30:45.292 --> 01:30:48.615
<i>the soldiers, sailors
and airmen in the field,</i>

01:30:48.833 --> 01:30:52.076
<i>and also those at home.</i>

01:30:52.708 --> 01:30:56.748
We defy Hitler with our endurance

01:30:56.958 --> 01:31:00.622
and our strength of character
and our refusal,

01:31:00.833 --> 01:31:03.371
to give in to Tyranny,
and oppression, and the

01:31:03.542 --> 01:31:06.285
the darkest evils in history.

01:31:09.125 --> 01:31:15.076
<i>This is not a war for glory.
It is a war for freedom.</i>

01:31:16.292 --> 01:31:19.205
<i>The Germans will strike back.</i>

01:31:20.042 --> 01:31:23.410
We do not know,
where they will hit.

01:31:23.625 --> 01:31:28.040
There new flying
bombs have no pilots.

01:31:28.458 --> 01:31:33.032
Destruction,
sent forth in a soulless machine.

01:31:35.458 --> 01:31:39.657
This is a weapon of cowards,

01:31:39.875 --> 01:31:42.663
and cowards cannot win.

01:31:42.875 --> 01:31:47.199
We must meet it with valor,
as our soldiers do.

01:31:47.500 --> 01:31:50.493
As those brave men
fight on the beaches,

01:31:50.667 --> 01:31:54.411
we on the home front
must fight on too.

01:31:54.583 --> 01:31:58.532
So that when they return,
covered in glory,

01:31:59.292 --> 01:32:02.035
we may share their honor.

01:32:03.125 --> 01:32:07.870
Hitler is again,
trying to menace us with fire.

01:32:09.125 --> 01:32:14.325
Four years ago he thought he could
break us with the blitz..

01:32:15.083 --> 01:32:19.248
He was wrong.
He is wrong again now.

01:32:19.750 --> 01:32:22.163
For we do not melt in fire.

01:32:22.458 --> 01:32:25.826
We are tempered by fire,
like steel,

01:32:26.042 --> 01:32:29.865
and emerge, strong,
and ready to fight.

01:32:30.333 --> 01:32:32.541
Hitler has started a fire,

01:32:32.750 --> 01:32:35.868
which must burn him out of Europe.

01:32:36.750 --> 01:32:39.538
Our troops will fight on...

01:32:39.792 --> 01:32:42.535
and the Allies will fight on.

01:32:42.792 --> 01:32:45.500
And I shall fight on,

01:32:45.667 --> 01:32:48.580
until we are free...

01:32:50.333 --> 01:32:53.497
We shall never surrender.

01:32:54.542 --> 01:32:59.082
And I shall never surrender.

01:33:23.208 --> 01:33:26.497
Oh, how I wish this was Scotch.

01:33:32.417 --> 01:33:33.498
Ah.. well.

01:34:32.333 --> 01:34:34.916
- Were you listening to the broadcast?
- Of course.

01:34:36.917 --> 01:34:38.499
You were wonderful.

01:34:42.667 --> 01:34:45.080
I was worried about you yesterday.

01:34:46.875 --> 01:34:51.415
You did a.. a really
wonderful thing,

01:34:53.042 --> 01:34:55.705
turning yourself around,
recovering.

01:34:56.250 --> 01:34:59.322
- I am not sure I've recovered.
- Impression was good enough.

01:34:59.542 --> 01:35:01.579
It never quite goes away.

01:35:02.083 --> 01:35:05.497
Sometimes the color drains from the
picture and it's all gray and dull...

01:35:05.667 --> 01:35:08.705
And I can't force it to change back.

01:35:10.958 --> 01:35:12.870
How is it looking now?

01:35:15.042 --> 01:35:16.374
A mixture.

01:35:18.625 --> 01:35:20.582
But I must live with that.

01:35:22.250 --> 01:35:27.917
You know, I think I might go to
Chartwell this weekend,

01:35:28.125 --> 01:35:31.448
and spend some time in the country.

01:35:33.458 --> 01:35:37.277
- Do a spot of painting.
- That is a very fine idea.

01:35:39.125 --> 01:35:42.994
There is a way the sun
hits the lake in the afternoon,

01:35:43.250 --> 01:35:44.866
under the willows.

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:49.619
Might make for a harmonious view.

01:35:51.125 --> 01:35:54.823
- In color?
- Eh um, possible...

01:35:58.125 --> 01:36:02.244
- And what about the war?
- Oh, I think,

01:36:02.458 --> 01:36:06.452
Eisenhower and Monty have that
well under control. Don't you?

01:36:14.958 --> 01:36:17.701
I would understand if you left me.

01:36:19.417 --> 01:36:22.251
I would leave me,
if I could.

01:36:24.833 --> 01:36:27.997
I don't want you to live around my edges..

01:36:30.458 --> 01:36:33.371
But perhaps we should

01:36:34.708 --> 01:36:36.745
just let each other in.

01:36:41.083 --> 01:36:44.952
- But you mustn't keep fighting.
- I have given up fighting.

01:36:45.417 --> 01:36:47.579
Do you really mean that?

01:36:52.292 --> 01:36:57.242
The most important thing in a war,
when you think of it,

01:36:57.500 --> 01:37:01.494
is for people to feel truly unified.

01:37:01.792 --> 01:37:04.500
Inspired, hopeful.

01:37:06.833 --> 01:37:08.950
Maybe I'll write another speech.

01:37:16.833 --> 01:37:19.075
I think I'll walk on for a while.

01:37:22.500 --> 01:37:24.082
Will you be alright?

01:37:26.542 --> 01:37:28.033
I'll manage.

01:39:04.875 --> 01:39:06.110
God Speed.

01:39:06.777 --> 01:39:10.899
