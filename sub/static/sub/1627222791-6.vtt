00:00.800 --> 00:04.960
This programme contains
violence and very strong language.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.600
Spear of the silver dawn.

00:12.640 --> 00:17.880
When the Chosen One possesses it,
she will unite the tribes.

00:17.920 --> 00:21.880
The Chosen One
will forge the great golden bow.

00:21.920 --> 00:23.960
Veran's searching
for the deserter.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.120
He's in a prison camp
up there in the Blue Hills.

00:26.160 --> 00:28.800
Find the spear before Rome.

00:28.840 --> 00:31.680
I want what Lokka wants.
You know I'm strong.

00:31.720 --> 00:33.400
Not like Aulus.

00:33.440 --> 00:36.080
They took our boy.
We'll find him. I promise.

00:36.120 --> 00:39.600
Something is wrong.

00:39.640 --> 00:43.080
What's the very last thing
Veran wants?

00:44.680 --> 00:47.760
But whatever Veran planned,
it wasn't this.

01:01.400 --> 01:03.400
We're here.

01:04.400 --> 01:06.920
We made it. See.

01:19.040 --> 01:21.040
Wait. Wait!

01:31.560 --> 01:34.080
Get out!
There's nothing for you here!

01:34.120 --> 01:36.400
Leave us what little
we have left, for pity's sake!

01:36.440 --> 01:38.400
I'm not here to rob you.
I found your son.

01:38.440 --> 01:41.040
I brought him back.
Get out! You're not welcome!

01:41.080 --> 01:43.280
He's here somewhere.
I saw him come in.

01:43.320 --> 01:46.240
-Make her go.
-Who are you?!
Why are you tormenting us?!

01:46.280 --> 01:48.720
No! I rescued your son.

01:48.760 --> 01:50.120
I brought him back!

01:50.160 --> 01:52.000
We don't have a son!

01:52.040 --> 01:54.040
We don't have any children.

01:59.320 --> 02:01.480
♪Children Of The Revolution

02:04.760 --> 02:06.760

In you go.

03:45.280 --> 03:47.280
Back in.

04:38.600 --> 04:41.040
Sir.

05:20.160 --> 05:21.480
Oh.

05:21.520 --> 05:23.520
When will they hatch?

05:24.680 --> 05:26.680
Don't...don't drop them.

05:28.080 --> 05:30.440
Keep them warm.

05:36.560 --> 05:38.000
How did you get in here?

05:38.040 --> 05:41.360
Your guard.
He's asleep...or drunk.

05:41.400 --> 05:44.320
Why are you here?

05:44.360 --> 05:48.760
The General has sent word that he
will be delayed a further few days.

05:48.800 --> 05:53.160
-Why?
-And also that he has your
associate, your friend, with him.

05:57.080 --> 06:01.240
Would you um...
clear those plates behind you?

06:08.320 --> 06:11.680
This what you imagined
when you became Praefectus?

06:11.720 --> 06:14.440
That you'd be left behind
to do the housework?

06:14.480 --> 06:16.480
A messenger boy?

06:20.680 --> 06:22.360
I'll get someone to clear this up.

06:22.400 --> 06:24.400
Thank you.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
Hey.

07:49.120 --> 07:53.320
So...when might be a good time
to discuss what happened back there?

07:53.360 --> 07:55.280
Just leave me alone.

07:55.320 --> 07:59.920
Running off on your own private
adventure, risking everything?

07:59.960 --> 08:01.840
What were you doing?

08:01.880 --> 08:05.440
The Gods' bidding. Isn't everything
I do the Gods' bidding?

08:05.480 --> 08:07.760
That's what everyone
keeps telling me.

08:07.800 --> 08:10.280
Just because every decision
you make is preordained

08:10.320 --> 08:13.720
by the Gods, doesn't mean you can't
ponder each one for a while,

08:13.760 --> 08:15.760
you know? Mull it over.

08:17.240 --> 08:19.400
Try to be a wise Chosen One.

08:19.440 --> 08:20.840
Not a stupid, reckless Chosen One.

08:20.880 --> 08:23.960
Just piss off!
No. You need to listen to me.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.440
Think back to those blessed days

08:25.480 --> 08:28.480
when you actually used to listen
to me, when I was your teacher.

08:28.520 --> 08:30.840
Things have changed since then.

08:30.880 --> 08:33.600
We'll stop here and rest a while.

08:33.640 --> 08:35.640
That's exactly my point.

08:35.680 --> 08:38.160
Yes, they have changed.

08:38.200 --> 08:40.200
Those challenges you faced
when training,

08:40.240 --> 08:42.760
what did you think
they were preparing you for?

08:42.800 --> 08:43.880
Easier challenges?

08:43.920 --> 08:45.920
No, the opposite.

08:45.960 --> 08:48.560
Challenges that are
more insanely difficult

08:48.600 --> 08:51.280
than you could ever imagine.
Earth, air, fire, water.

08:51.320 --> 08:53.000
Those were the simple ones.

08:53.040 --> 08:55.280
Basic stuff
that a kid could understand.

08:55.320 --> 09:00.560
Now you're dealing with entities
you can't possibly comprehend.

09:05.840 --> 09:08.680
Giddap!

09:12.040 --> 09:14.520
I set those tasks for you.

09:14.560 --> 09:16.560
Me, your friend.

09:18.480 --> 09:22.000
Now, who knows what forces
are focused on you?

09:22.040 --> 09:25.160
The Chosen One?
Willing you to succeed or to fail?

09:27.400 --> 09:30.960
-I got a message.
-I know, and these
messages are often ambiguous

09:31.000 --> 09:34.880
or brittle and have to be
deciphered.'One will betray you.'

09:34.920 --> 09:36.360
What's that?

09:36.400 --> 09:39.480
How would you interpret
'One of them will betray you?'

09:39.520 --> 09:41.800
Ambiguous? A riddle?

09:42.960 --> 09:44.360
I'm drowning here.

09:44.400 --> 09:46.120
Fucking help me, will you?

09:46.160 --> 09:48.680
Where did this warning come from?

09:48.720 --> 09:50.440
It wasn't a warning.

09:50.480 --> 09:52.280
It was a threat.

09:52.320 --> 09:54.320
From where?

09:55.760 --> 09:58.240
From a child.

09:58.280 --> 10:00.440
A boy...

10:00.480 --> 10:03.600
who spoke with all the arrogance
of the Roman devil.

10:08.280 --> 10:12.680
Find out who will betray me
and find out who they answer to,

10:12.720 --> 10:15.800
because I don't need to understand
the forces at work against me.

10:15.840 --> 10:17.840
I just need to know their name.

10:20.240 --> 10:22.240
How do you know it's not me?

10:23.520 --> 10:25.480
I don't.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
It can't be me.

10:42.640 --> 10:44.640
Why is this mine?

10:45.640 --> 10:47.040
It's ridiculous.

10:47.080 --> 10:49.800
Do you want me to give you a lesson?

10:49.840 --> 10:52.000
-What?!
-An archery lesson.

10:52.040 --> 10:54.560
-You look nervous.
-I'm not nervous.

10:54.600 --> 10:56.000
You're nervous.

10:56.040 --> 10:58.000
You give ME a lesson?!

10:58.040 --> 11:01.000
I've never heard anything so absurd.
All right.

11:03.720 --> 11:06.000
I may not be able to leg it up
a tree like a squirrel

11:06.040 --> 11:08.680
or tell my thistleworts
from a sedge-blain,

11:08.720 --> 11:11.320
but I used to be
a Cantii prince, remember?

11:11.360 --> 11:14.640
I was taught archery every day
from the age of...three.

11:15.800 --> 11:19.800
Shooting an arrow
-is one thing I can actually do.
-Mm.

11:21.400 --> 11:24.880
I can show you the basics, at least.
Fine! Whatever!

11:24.920 --> 11:28.360
If that's what you want,
if that's what'll make you happy.

11:28.400 --> 11:30.400
Let's go.

11:32.800 --> 11:35.360
How many were there?

11:35.400 --> 11:37.400
Four or five, I think.

11:40.520 --> 11:42.920
Why didn't they go after you?

11:42.960 --> 11:44.160
They didn't see me.

11:44.200 --> 11:47.360
They just charged through
and you were in their path.

11:51.520 --> 11:53.520
Sorry.

12:09.520 --> 12:11.600
You all right?

12:11.640 --> 12:13.800
Keep still.

12:21.200 --> 12:22.600
What are we aiming at?

12:22.640 --> 12:24.800
The tree, pine tree.

12:26.160 --> 12:27.640
Eyes on the target.

12:27.680 --> 12:30.360
Oh, on the target. Game-changer

12:31.480 --> 12:33.080
Deep breath...

12:33.120 --> 12:34.120
and...

12:34.160 --> 12:37.880
when you draw,
draw back in one smooth motion,

12:37.920 --> 12:40.400
bringing the bow up
at the same time,

12:40.440 --> 12:44.240
so that the arrow's in a straight
line with your arm. And...

13:04.160 --> 13:05.680
Very good.

13:05.720 --> 13:07.680
-Eyes on the target.
-Yes, I know.

13:07.720 --> 13:09.720
-Deep breath.
-Please.

13:09.760 --> 13:11.760
Fuck!

13:17.800 --> 13:20.320
Sorry. Sorry. Is everyone all right?

13:20.360 --> 13:22.360
What the fuck was that?!

13:23.360 --> 13:24.920
What are you trying to do?

13:24.960 --> 13:28.040
-Huh?
-It was a mistake.
The bow string snapped.

13:29.040 --> 13:31.760
Oh, you got a cut on your cheek.
I fucking know.

13:33.480 --> 13:36.120
I might have something
that could help with that.

13:39.200 --> 13:41.560
What's that you've got there?

13:41.600 --> 13:43.600
What, this?

13:44.720 --> 13:48.520
Well...this is Big Pebble.

13:49.760 --> 13:51.760
-Big Pebble?
-Mm-hm.

13:57.520 --> 13:59.760
Big Pebble. Mm, ah, ooh.

14:02.320 --> 14:04.720
Big Pebble knows all about you.

14:04.760 --> 14:06.920
Sees your secrets.

14:06.960 --> 14:09.000
What you hide away.

14:09.040 --> 14:11.360
You are hiding something
from everyone.

14:12.960 --> 14:16.120
(And now, Big Pebble told me.

14:18.080 --> 14:20.080
What did he tell me?)

14:22.240 --> 14:24.720
He told you that...

14:26.440 --> 14:28.440
..sometimes...

14:29.440 --> 14:31.440
..I weep.

14:31.480 --> 14:32.680
You weep?

14:32.720 --> 14:34.440
The responsibility on my shoulders

14:34.480 --> 14:38.000
that I have been blessed
to protect the Chosen One.

14:39.800 --> 14:41.800
Then you weep?

14:42.840 --> 14:46.760
I can't allow my weakness
to affect morale...

14:46.800 --> 14:49.440
so I go and find a quiet place.

14:49.480 --> 14:51.360
And have a little cry?

14:53.240 --> 14:55.240
No further questions.

15:10.240 --> 15:12.560
Making potions?

15:12.600 --> 15:14.680
Who are you planning on poisoning?

15:15.880 --> 15:18.280
The General wanted
Mediterranean herbs in his garden

15:18.320 --> 15:20.680
to remind him of home.

15:20.720 --> 15:22.320
They're not thriving.

15:22.360 --> 15:24.440
Too much rain.

15:24.480 --> 15:28.960
We're planning a feast tomorrow
night, in honour of our master.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.080
-Here?
-Here.

15:31.120 --> 15:34.400
Shouldn't we wait for your husband's
return? He'll be sorry to miss it.

15:34.440 --> 15:36.400
It's precisely because
of his absence.

15:36.440 --> 15:39.400
The Lokka grows impatient
and needs placating.

15:39.440 --> 15:40.840
He needs proof of our loyalty.

15:40.880 --> 15:42.440
He must be in no doubt
of our devotion.

15:42.480 --> 15:44.680
Mm. He'll want a sacrifice.

15:44.720 --> 15:46.800
-He will.
-Hm.

15:46.840 --> 15:47.960
The witch?

15:48.000 --> 15:52.880
I think...we can do
-better than that.
-Hm.

15:52.920 --> 15:54.920
Who, then?

15:56.120 --> 15:59.320
A precious...possession.

16:00.320 --> 16:02.640
A beautiful jewel.

16:02.680 --> 16:05.760
Someone worth sacrificing.

16:10.360 --> 16:12.920
Why don't we give it some thought,
you and I?

16:14.480 --> 16:16.480
No need to decide now.

16:18.800 --> 16:23.080
We could use some
of your Mediterranean herbs.

16:23.120 --> 16:25.680
That'll be nice.

16:25.720 --> 16:27.520
Can you pick a bunch?

16:27.560 --> 16:29.520
Bring them to the kitchen?

16:29.560 --> 16:31.560
Choose your faves!

17:35.480 --> 17:37.000
Take me to the Underworld.

17:37.040 --> 17:38.040
Why?

17:38.080 --> 17:41.960
Because tomorrow, I'm hosting
a feast to honour my master, Lokka.

17:42.000 --> 17:45.360
If you don't wanna lose any more
precious limbs, you'll do as I say!

17:49.160 --> 17:51.160
Your master, Lokka?

17:52.160 --> 17:55.080
No more your master
than he is mine.

17:55.120 --> 17:58.640
It's not your party.
You don't get to choose anything.

18:02.520 --> 18:04.520
I know why you want to go.

18:06.080 --> 18:11.800
Think you'll come back with an
advantage over that demon you're
fucking that'll save your skin.

18:12.840 --> 18:15.480
Help me bring the demon down.

18:15.520 --> 18:17.520
You hate him as much as me.

18:19.640 --> 18:21.640
It's not that easy.

18:23.240 --> 18:25.960
You have no idea
what game you're in...

18:26.000 --> 18:28.200
let alone how to play it.

18:28.240 --> 18:30.840
I can help you.

18:30.880 --> 18:32.880
I could leave the key.

18:46.960 --> 18:48.960
Look.

18:50.640 --> 18:52.800
Found this the day
they locked me up.

18:53.840 --> 18:56.320
Leads under the stables to
a breach in the wall

18:56.360 --> 19:02.040
and there I can see...
the marsh and forests and freedom.

19:03.520 --> 19:05.520
I can't leave.

19:07.440 --> 19:09.440
Not while Aulus' thumb is on me.

19:12.800 --> 19:14.800
Not until his curse is lifted.

19:18.040 --> 19:20.680
You can't help me.

19:23.240 --> 19:26.440
I have more influence
-than you think.
-You have none.

19:30.360 --> 19:33.240
She holds all the strings,
your high priestess.

19:36.080 --> 19:39.720
Your only way to him is through her.

19:58.880 --> 20:00.880
Here, Fella.

20:02.760 --> 20:04.680
I never established whether
you can't speak

20:04.720 --> 20:06.720
or whether you just don't.

20:08.160 --> 20:11.240
I mean, is it a condition
or are you just in a bad mood?

20:14.520 --> 20:17.640
Doesn't matter.

20:22.000 --> 20:25.560
Oh.

20:25.600 --> 20:27.760
Look, this is Big Pebble.

20:28.840 --> 20:31.040
Look at it.

20:31.080 --> 20:32.520
Your eyes.

20:32.560 --> 20:35.040
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

20:35.080 --> 20:37.720
Not so fast, Fella.

20:37.760 --> 20:39.760
Big Pebble has a question for you.

20:40.920 --> 20:43.680
Are you ready?

20:43.720 --> 20:46.120
Are you taking the fucking piss?

20:48.880 --> 20:51.520
The name's Drella, not Fella.

20:52.720 --> 20:56.160
I don't know what you think you're
doing with the stone, but it's...

20:56.200 --> 20:57.480
it's embarrassing.

20:57.520 --> 20:59.920
Can I...?

20:59.960 --> 21:03.560
If what you wanna ask me...
if Large Pebble's question is,

21:03.600 --> 21:05.960
'Who is the one to watch?,'

21:06.000 --> 21:07.800
my answer is...

21:07.840 --> 21:11.400
every single one
of you fucking clowns!

21:11.440 --> 21:13.440
But specifically?

21:15.000 --> 21:17.800
The Regni, Ania.

21:17.840 --> 21:20.960
If she's not about to
stab someone in the back...

21:21.000 --> 21:23.720
then my name's not fucking Drella,
you cunt!

21:23.760 --> 21:25.760
Yeah?

21:30.480 --> 21:33.200
Does that answer your question?

21:34.320 --> 21:36.400
No, no. No.

21:56.640 --> 21:58.280
What?

21:58.320 --> 22:00.720
Did I hear right?
Did you coax some words

22:00.760 --> 22:03.000
from our fragrant friend over there?

22:07.880 --> 22:09.880
What did she say?

22:09.920 --> 22:12.720
Well, she called me a cunt.

22:14.320 --> 22:17.680
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Oh, you don't drink like him.

22:20.960 --> 22:22.960
Second thoughts...

22:32.880 --> 22:35.080
Not used to it.

22:35.120 --> 22:38.720
Why don't you question me
with your large stone?

22:38.760 --> 22:40.760
-Big Pebble.
-Oh.

22:42.520 --> 22:44.760
Big Pebble doesn't work
on everybody.

22:44.800 --> 22:48.600
I'm pretty sure Big Pebble
wouldn't have much effect on you.

22:48.640 --> 22:50.680
Didn't work on Fella.

22:50.720 --> 22:52.720
Let me see it.

22:59.160 --> 23:03.080
What's it supposed to do?
-Make you feel something?
-Not sure.

23:03.120 --> 23:05.400
I've never used it on myself.

23:05.440 --> 23:08.240
-No, I'm not getting anything.
-Hm.

23:08.280 --> 23:11.760
-I told you.
-Is that because
I'm such a cold, hard bitch?

23:11.800 --> 23:14.280
You're certainly very angry
most of the time.

23:16.280 --> 23:18.800
It's exhausting.

23:18.840 --> 23:22.680
I remember times
when I wasn't angry at all.

23:22.720 --> 23:24.880
I was a mother once.

23:24.920 --> 23:29.080
I remember the times
when I was bursting with happiness.

23:31.040 --> 23:32.520
What happened?

23:32.560 --> 23:34.720
Rome fucking happened.

23:34.760 --> 23:36.760
And now anger is all I have.

23:37.960 --> 23:39.920
I'm only content
when I'm spitting blood

23:39.960 --> 23:42.000
and revenge
is all that drives me.

23:45.400 --> 23:47.560
You should try
your big stone on her.

23:49.600 --> 23:52.320
She'd fall for it.

23:52.360 --> 23:54.360
She loves all that.

23:55.560 --> 23:57.640
That's not why you're angry.

23:57.680 --> 23:58.720
Hm?

23:58.760 --> 24:01.960
I said,
'That's not why you're angry.'

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
What happened to your son?

24:06.640 --> 24:09.160
That's not why
you really hate the Druids.

24:10.160 --> 24:12.720
It's something else...

24:12.760 --> 24:14.760
isn't it?

24:23.800 --> 24:26.280
You shouldn't leave camp
by yourself at night.

24:26.320 --> 24:28.320
It's not safe.

24:29.360 --> 24:30.880
What are you doing?

24:30.920 --> 24:32.360
None of your business.

24:32.400 --> 24:34.040
That looks nasty.

24:34.080 --> 24:37.320
How did you do that?
Your stupid fucking arrow.

24:37.360 --> 24:40.120
-It hit you as well?
-It hit me first.

24:40.160 --> 24:42.160
Wow. I mean, that's terrible.

24:43.440 --> 24:44.880
So sorry.

24:44.920 --> 24:47.480
The string was er...
the string was broken.

24:48.680 --> 24:51.920
I don't know
if you've seen...this.

24:54.560 --> 24:56.400
Again?

24:56.440 --> 24:58.360
What's this?

24:58.400 --> 25:01.320
What are you trying to do?

25:01.360 --> 25:02.760
Look at the pebble.

25:02.800 --> 25:05.120
Look how smooth it is.

25:05.160 --> 25:06.320
What is it?

25:06.360 --> 25:08.400
Big Pebble.

25:08.440 --> 25:11.520
Look at the lovely, smooth pebble.
Look at it.

25:13.960 --> 25:15.960
You look at it.

25:19.800 --> 25:24.200
You see, you can't trust Big Pebble.

25:34.920 --> 25:36.920
Surrender to Lokka.

25:38.360 --> 25:40.480
You haven't got a chance.

27:41.720 --> 27:46.680
Captain. A heavy column's
-been sighted.
-A what? Pardon?

27:46.720 --> 27:49.400
Cohort, heading from the east
towards this place.

27:49.440 --> 27:51.840
Well, who are they?
Where are they going?

27:51.880 --> 27:53.680
I was dispatched
when they were sighted.

27:53.720 --> 27:55.600
The others have gone
to intercept 'em.

27:55.640 --> 27:57.800
They'll be en route to the
frontline. We can't take

27:57.840 --> 27:59.040
any more prisoners here.

27:59.080 --> 28:00.240
We're at capacity.

28:00.280 --> 28:02.480
Send word - no more room.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
Captain.

28:23.400 --> 28:25.400
Here, look.

28:43.240 --> 28:44.960
Can I help?

28:45.000 --> 28:47.200
You're Lucius Validus.

28:47.240 --> 28:48.880
And you are...?

28:48.920 --> 28:51.280
-Oh, Rufus.
-Felix.

28:51.320 --> 28:53.880
Yeah, we were with you
when you were Praefectus.

28:53.920 --> 28:55.920
Right.

28:57.280 --> 28:59.280
Well, hello again.

29:00.760 --> 29:03.480
Sorry to see you here
in the same boat as us.

29:03.520 --> 29:05.640
I'm not in the same boat as you.

29:05.680 --> 29:07.200
Yeah, no...

29:07.240 --> 29:11.160
it's an expression meaning,
'We're all in the same situation.'

29:11.200 --> 29:14.040
All about to be executed
for desertion.

29:14.080 --> 29:15.520
Not me.

29:15.560 --> 29:16.600
Not today.

29:16.640 --> 29:20.080
I thought...
I thought it was today?

29:20.120 --> 29:21.640
That's what we were told.

29:21.680 --> 29:24.240
That's what the man said, isn't it?
Yeah. Today.

29:24.280 --> 29:28.960
Well, then I hope today you will be
with your Gods and ancestors

29:29.000 --> 29:32.120
and free from the sufferings
of this world.

29:32.160 --> 29:34.880
Me, I'm on a different path.

29:36.360 --> 29:38.360
Well, how come?

29:38.400 --> 29:41.440
If I told you,
you wouldn't believe me.

29:41.480 --> 29:43.480
Tell us.

29:45.760 --> 29:47.960
You sure it's today
you're to be executed?

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
Pretty sure.

29:53.960 --> 29:56.240
Budge up. Budge, budge, budge.

30:02.760 --> 30:07.040
There's a spear
that everybody wants.

30:07.080 --> 30:09.480
The spear of the Silver Dawn.

30:11.040 --> 30:13.000
Aulus wants it.

30:13.040 --> 30:15.000
The Druids want it.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
I have it.

30:19.360 --> 30:23.480
Ten years ago, maybe 15,

30:23.520 --> 30:26.400
at Calvery, outside Jerusalem,

30:26.440 --> 30:31.720
there was a regular
weekday crucifixion. This mystic,

30:31.760 --> 30:34.480
this one was holding on...

30:39.680 --> 30:42.920
He looked me in the eye...
and he forgave me.

30:43.920 --> 30:46.960
He didn't say anything,
but he forgave me.

30:49.360 --> 30:54.960
Now, I don't know who that man was
or even if he's part of the story,

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
but the spear...

30:59.720 --> 31:03.520
..the spear has the power...

31:03.560 --> 31:05.680
to change worlds.

31:09.640 --> 31:12.880
And that's why
I won't be dying today.

31:14.000 --> 31:15.600
Hm?

31:15.640 --> 31:17.640
Oh, cool.

31:27.480 --> 31:29.480
Here she is.

31:33.960 --> 31:37.280
Prison camp's on the plain north of
here. I can get a vantage point

31:37.320 --> 31:38.320
on the forested side.

31:38.360 --> 31:40.880
Have they got Lucius?
Did you see him?

31:40.920 --> 31:43.000
It was too far away.

31:43.040 --> 31:46.320
But if he is there,
they don't know who they're holding.

31:46.360 --> 31:47.840
The place is a mess.

31:47.880 --> 31:49.880
It's hardly even guarded.

31:53.480 --> 31:57.760
If your sister has lied to us,
you will pay the price.

32:18.880 --> 32:20.880
All right, mate?

32:23.960 --> 32:25.040
All right?

32:25.080 --> 32:26.640
What do you want?!

32:26.680 --> 32:28.680
Prison camp's been sighted.

32:30.080 --> 32:32.080
We're moving off.

33:11.080 --> 33:15.160
Behold the majesty
and splendour of the Roman Empire.

33:16.440 --> 33:18.440
Looks like a cesspit.

33:18.480 --> 33:20.360
Looks like a shithole.

33:20.400 --> 33:23.120
Yeah, same thing, really.

33:23.160 --> 33:24.760
There.

33:24.800 --> 33:26.400
That's the cart
they took him away in.

33:26.440 --> 33:28.240
So they don't know.

33:28.280 --> 33:30.000
They look hungover.

33:30.040 --> 33:32.240
Probably get pissed every night.

33:32.280 --> 33:33.960
You were right.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.080
This should be easy.

33:36.120 --> 33:38.880
They might not even notice.

33:38.920 --> 33:40.920
They might notice.

33:48.000 --> 33:49.440
Shit.

33:49.480 --> 33:53.080
Got to give us a day's warning.
Clear up some of this shit.

33:53.120 --> 33:56.000
Just... I don't know, stack it
-somewhere out of sight.
-Yes, sir.

33:56.040 --> 33:59.240
Oh, come on! Fuck's sake!

33:59.280 --> 34:01.280
-Space out a bit!
Move up!

34:01.320 --> 34:03.440
Where's your sword?
Left it over there.

34:03.480 --> 34:05.480
Well, fucking go and get it!

34:11.160 --> 34:12.840
It's up.

34:12.880 --> 34:14.640
Horses.

34:14.680 --> 34:16.680
Who are we expecting?

34:18.000 --> 34:20.560
I imagine it's my rescue party.

34:39.720 --> 34:41.720
The Roman Devil.

34:46.160 --> 34:50.080
Bloody hell.
Is this good or bad news?

34:56.880 --> 35:00.440
Look to the General!

35:08.400 --> 35:10.400
Hello, old friend.

36:38.640 --> 36:42.120
Welcome. Welcome. Welcome.

36:44.320 --> 36:45.800
Tonight...

36:45.840 --> 36:47.840
we will honour our master.

36:49.760 --> 36:51.960
Tonight...

36:52.000 --> 36:55.240
we will show him...our devotion.

37:59.320 --> 38:01.360
Oh, Majesty.

38:03.480 --> 38:05.480
Here you are.

38:07.360 --> 38:09.040
What are you doing?

38:09.080 --> 38:11.880
Preparing, High Priestess.

38:11.920 --> 38:14.440
Everybody is asking after you.

39:03.120 --> 39:05.360
He has come.

39:17.960 --> 39:19.960
It's time.

39:21.600 --> 39:24.480
Come. Hm.

39:24.520 --> 39:26.600
Who is it to be?

39:26.640 --> 39:28.640
A precious possession.

39:29.680 --> 39:31.680
A beautiful jewel.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.920
The Veran.
We need to get out.

41:32.960 --> 41:35.160
I know a way.

41:38.400 --> 41:40.960
It's stopped.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.920
We have to go.

41:43.960 --> 41:46.320
I must see him.
I must speak with him.

41:46.360 --> 41:49.280
No. He's not here to speak.

41:49.320 --> 41:51.080
He's here to destroy.

41:51.120 --> 41:53.680
I can stop him.
No. He's poisoned the air.

41:53.720 --> 41:55.440
We have to go now.

41:55.480 --> 41:57.680
I know a way.

41:57.720 --> 41:59.800
Come on!

42:50.560 --> 42:52.960
About time.

43:00.880 --> 43:03.200
If you slay me...

43:03.240 --> 43:05.720
the price will be the Druids.

43:05.760 --> 43:07.800
Every last one.

43:07.840 --> 43:12.360
So not even your stories, your...
your bullshit myths and legends,

43:12.400 --> 43:14.800
not even your memory will survive.

43:14.840 --> 43:17.560
Hear me, earth demon.

43:17.920 --> 43:21.360
-No.
-Hear me, Lokka!

43:29.160 --> 43:31.160
No!

43:33.120 --> 43:36.760
10,000 dead, a rusted blade,

43:38.320 --> 43:40.040
string of beads,

43:40.080 --> 43:42.080
debt unpaid...

43:46.320 --> 43:47.880
..a home infested,

43:47.920 --> 43:49.360
poisoned ink,

43:49.400 --> 43:52.240
a forest felled, an acid wind,

43:52.280 --> 43:55.800
hope laid waste, wells of oil,

43:55.840 --> 43:57.400
garnet and glass,

43:57.440 --> 43:58.800
a clarion call,

43:58.840 --> 44:01.920
fill the cup, dredge the moat,

44:01.960 --> 44:03.360
tainted rain,

44:03.400 --> 44:05.640
a foundered boat...

44:07.080 --> 44:08.400
Come on.

44:08.440 --> 44:10.440
Come on. Come on!

44:11.480 --> 44:13.480
Ugh. Ugh.

44:32.840 --> 44:35.560
Where does it lead?
To a breach in the wall. Go.

45:38.560 --> 45:40.560
He has come.

45:44.920 --> 45:47.200
