- So you'll become a
Hindu or something?

26:52.866 --> 26:54.100
- No.

26:54.400 --> 26:56.166
[scoffs] I don't know.

26:56.166 --> 26:57.300
That's the point.

26:59.666 --> 27:01.833
- What does Yogi
say about all this?

27:01.833 --> 27:03.666
[laughs]

27:04.166 --> 27:06.800
- Something fucking spiritual.

27:07.166 --> 27:08.800
- Do you love him?

27:09.700 --> 27:11.966
- Yogi doesn't believe in love,

27:11.966 --> 27:14.900
not as the Western
mind understands it.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.533
- What do you believe in?

27:17.533 --> 27:20.866
- I believe, sometimes you
just have to re-evaluate

27:20.866 --> 27:23.600
and say fuck it.

27:25.633 --> 27:26.933
- So you think I
should say fuck it

27:26.933 --> 27:28.733
and just go for it with Brady?

27:29.333 --> 27:31.900
- Well, that's not
for me to say, is it?

27:32.500 --> 27:34.366
But if you don't,

27:34.366 --> 27:37.400
I can always teach you
some tantric masturbation.

27:37.400 --> 27:38.866
[laughs]

27:41.666 --> 27:44.066
- Do you ever think,
what if I jumped?

27:44.066 --> 27:45.766
[screaming]

27:48.400 --> 27:49.800
- I do.

27:50.400 --> 27:53.700
I wonder, what if Luke jumped?

27:53.800 --> 27:56.566
- Seriously, what
difference would it make?

27:56.566 --> 27:58.500
- Well, Angus would
then be my best mate,

27:58.500 --> 27:59.866
which would be shit.

27:59.866 --> 28:01.700
- What about Jennifer?

28:02.566 --> 28:05.100
- What if you pushed her off?

28:05.100 --> 28:06.300
- Would she care?

28:06.300 --> 28:07.800
Would she give a shit?

28:07.800 --> 28:08.500
- Of course she would.

28:08.500 --> 28:09.266
She loved you.

28:09.266 --> 28:11.100
- Ah, see? Loved.

28:11.366 --> 28:12.833
Past tense.

28:13.233 --> 28:15.533
Would she cry? Would she?

28:16.333 --> 28:17.533
- Do you want her to cry?

28:17.533 --> 28:19.300
- Fuck yeah, I want her to cry.

28:19.300 --> 28:21.333
I want her to be sad.
I want her heartbroken.

28:21.333 --> 28:24.433
I want her to sleep on my
coffin, to weep on my grave.

28:24.433 --> 28:25.933
- It's getting a little
bit weird, now, mate.

28:25.933 --> 28:27.233
- Oh, you wouldn't understand.

28:27.233 --> 28:28.233
- Why?

28:28.233 --> 28:29.833
- Well, you're hardly--

28:29.833 --> 28:31.333
forgive me,

28:31.333 --> 28:33.466
deep, when it comes
to relationships.

28:33.466 --> 28:35.433
- I've had tons
of relationships.

28:35.433 --> 28:37.500
- I don't count tromboning
as a relationship.

28:37.500 --> 28:39.066
- I've had girlfriends.

28:39.066 --> 28:40.866
- Yeah, but you hardly
loved any of them.

28:40.866 --> 28:42.100
- How would you know?

28:42.100 --> 28:43.533
- Well, when you're in
love, you're fulfilled.

28:43.533 --> 28:44.800
That person becomes
a part of you.

28:44.800 --> 28:46.833
They become the reason
that you breathe.

28:46.833 --> 28:48.166
They make you feel
like you're the person

28:48.166 --> 28:49.933
you always wanted to be.

28:49.933 --> 28:51.966
- And you just became the
gayest man in England.

28:51.966 --> 28:54.933
- Have you ever said I love you?

28:55.533 --> 28:57.266
- Well, I thought it
might scare you off,

28:57.266 --> 28:59.333
but I love you.

28:59.400 --> 29:01.900
- I don't need any
more weird stuff today.

29:01.900 --> 29:04.266
- [laughs] What?

29:04.266 --> 29:05.600
- What's that?

29:05.600 --> 29:06.966
Is that from Jen?

29:06.966 --> 29:08.700
- Take a look.

29:12.166 --> 29:13.400
[laughs]

29:13.400 --> 29:16.000
- Wow! Love, mum.

29:18.233 --> 29:20.733
Wow, that, that is fucked up.

29:20.733 --> 29:22.700
- That could scar
someone for life.

29:22.700 --> 29:24.300
- Your mummy's pretty hot.

29:24.300 --> 29:26.133
- Seriously!

29:26.900 --> 29:29.100
- You are way too
serious today, man.

29:29.100 --> 29:30.533
I'm trying to take the day off,

29:30.533 --> 29:32.666
and you're acting like
Julia Fucking Roberts.

29:34.400 --> 29:35.833
- All right.

29:35.900 --> 29:37.733
So how was last night?

29:39.233 --> 29:41.233
- Well, this feels wrong.

29:41.366 --> 29:42.300
- What?

29:42.300 --> 29:43.766
- We're sitting on a clifftop.

29:43.766 --> 29:47.400
This isn't the right place
for this kind of conversation.

29:47.400 --> 29:51.033
There's only one place
for this kind of chat.

29:56.166 --> 30:00.200
- The pub, that great
bastion of British tradition,

30:00.800 --> 30:02.500
a place to meet,

30:02.500 --> 30:04.833
socialize, discuss politics,

30:04.833 --> 30:07.566
and current affairs,

30:08.900 --> 30:10.333
or to tell jokes, get pissed,

30:10.333 --> 30:11.766
rant about football,

30:11.766 --> 30:13.733
and argue for three hours about
who's the best James Bond.

30:14.433 --> 30:17.100
I think the answer to that
is pretty fucking clear.

30:17.400 --> 30:21.200
It's a symbol of all that is
great in this fair Britain.

30:22.066 --> 30:24.433
God bless the pub.

30:37.900 --> 30:39.133
- [Swerve] Morning, lads.

30:39.133 --> 30:40.400
- Morning, Swerve.

30:40.500 --> 30:41.866
- [Swerve] Bit early for
you two today, isn't it?

30:41.866 --> 30:43.433
- Not today, it's not.

30:45.333 --> 30:46.400
- The usual.

30:46.400 --> 30:49.033
- Yeah, thanks. That was quick.

30:49.033 --> 30:50.533
- [Swerve] I read your mind.

30:50.533 --> 30:52.000
What's the matter
with you today?

30:52.000 --> 30:54.066
- He got a Valentine's
day card from his mum.

30:54.066 --> 30:54.966
- Oy!

30:54.966 --> 30:56.800
I've got writer's block.

30:56.800 --> 30:57.733
- Writer, eh?

30:57.733 --> 30:58.833
- Yeah.

30:59.100 --> 31:00.266
- What sort of writer?

31:00.266 --> 31:01.533
- Novels.

31:01.533 --> 31:03.000
- Well, you're the next
Jeffrey Archer, are you?

31:03.000 --> 31:04.233
- God, I hope not.

31:04.233 --> 31:05.433
No, mine's about a man hunted

31:05.433 --> 31:07.666
by the demons from a
parallel dimension.

31:07.666 --> 31:09.466
- Nah, don't like
all of that stuff.

31:09.466 --> 31:12.500
I prefer a bit of
erotic fiction, myself.

31:12.500 --> 31:14.500
- So you two coming
to the party tonight?

31:14.500 --> 31:17.300
- Well, I'll see
how depressed I am.

31:17.300 --> 31:19.266
- You want to move on.

31:19.266 --> 31:21.433
She obviously has.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.200
He's a bit sensitive, there.

31:29.200 --> 31:31.266
- Ah, you know,
love and all that.

31:31.266 --> 31:33.300
- I prefer a bit
of dogging, myself.

31:33.500 --> 31:35.066
[disgusted sigh]

31:42.633 --> 31:45.333
[ominous music]

31:48.866 --> 31:50.266
- What you looking at?

31:50.266 --> 31:51.800
- Nothing.

31:51.800 --> 31:52.866
To our lives.

31:52.866 --> 31:54.633
- Tp going nowhere fast.

31:55.100 --> 31:57.033
- So now we're in our
comfortable seats,

31:57.033 --> 31:58.766
tell me about last night.

31:59.933 --> 32:01.666
- A gentlemen never tells,

32:01.666 --> 32:04.033
but me, not being one, would,

32:04.033 --> 32:06.866
except I really don't remember.

32:06.866 --> 32:09.533
- What, no memory
of mind-blowing sex?

32:09.533 --> 32:11.033
- I don't even
remember pulling her.

32:11.033 --> 32:13.466
- Ah, that's because you didn't.

32:13.466 --> 32:15.233
- She came after me.

32:15.233 --> 32:16.866
- Like a velociraptor.

32:16.866 --> 32:18.633
- All I know is, I
woke up this morning

32:18.633 --> 32:20.600
in a strange bed with a girl--

32:20.600 --> 32:22.366
- A sex crazy, nympho girl.

32:22.366 --> 32:26.966
- A sex, crazy nympho girl
riding me like a palamino.

32:29.333 --> 32:30.533
- You got laid in your sleep?

32:30.533 --> 32:32.566
- I know, cheeky bitch.

32:32.566 --> 32:34.566
- I can think of worse
ways to be woken up.

32:34.566 --> 32:36.866
- I can see how you
might think that.

32:36.866 --> 32:38.233
- What, sexy girl...

32:38.233 --> 32:40.100
- She was pretty sexy.

32:40.100 --> 32:41.533
- Great body.

32:41.533 --> 32:43.466
- Ah, some people might
think it was a good body.

32:43.466 --> 32:45.500
- Then what can you be
possibly upset about?

32:45.500 --> 32:48.166
- Well, she was pretty crazy.

32:48.166 --> 32:50.433
- You put up with a bit
of crazy for some sex.

32:50.433 --> 32:52.066
- It's not all about sex.

32:52.066 --> 32:53.300
- You are kidding.

32:53.300 --> 32:55.500
This is you. It's
all about the sex.

32:55.500 --> 32:57.633
- I just didn't
want to be with her.

32:57.633 --> 32:58.933
- Wait, wait, wait.

32:58.933 --> 33:00.233
You didn't want to be,

33:00.233 --> 33:01.166
for one night,

33:01.166 --> 33:03.633
with a sex crazy blond nympho?

33:03.633 --> 33:04.800
- No.

33:04.800 --> 33:06.033
I'm sick of it.

33:06.033 --> 33:08.366
All the girls, all the
one-night stands...

33:08.366 --> 33:09.400
- The brilliant sex...

33:09.400 --> 33:10.566
- It's meaningless.

33:10.566 --> 33:12.466
I don't love any of those girls.

33:12.466 --> 33:14.166
I don't want to spend the
rest of my life waking up

33:14.166 --> 33:16.333
in strange beds with
girls I hardly know

33:16.333 --> 33:18.333
whose names I can't remember.

33:18.333 --> 33:20.766
- I am not getting your point.

33:21.100 --> 33:23.966
- I've fallen in
love with someone.

33:24.266 --> 33:26.233
[laughs]

33:28.000 --> 33:29.933
I'm fucking serious.

33:29.933 --> 33:31.500
- What are you talking about?

33:31.500 --> 33:34.233
- I've fallen in love.

33:34.800 --> 33:36.333
- [laughs] Seriously?

33:37.133 --> 33:38.533
- Totally.

33:42.433 --> 33:44.666
- Oh, Jesus, you're serious.

33:44.666 --> 33:46.333
With who?

33:46.333 --> 33:47.800
It's not Jennifer?

33:47.800 --> 33:49.700
Fuck, no, no.

33:49.700 --> 33:50.833
- What's wrong with Jennifer?

33:50.833 --> 33:52.966
- Uh, it's Fred.

33:53.666 --> 33:56.333
- Come on, seriously.
Who is it, really?

33:56.333 --> 33:58.166
- It's Fred.

33:59.000 --> 34:00.966
- You're in love with Fred?

34:01.500 --> 34:04.066
- Why is that so
hard to believe?

34:04.233 --> 34:05.966
- What, you've known each
other since you were kids.

34:05.966 --> 34:08.466
That's a bit inbred.

34:08.766 --> 34:09.733
- Fuck off.

34:09.733 --> 34:10.933
- She's leaving soon.

34:10.933 --> 34:12.000
What are you going
to do about that?

34:12.000 --> 34:13.166
- I don't know.

34:13.166 --> 34:14.565
I wanted to tell
her this morning,

34:14.565 --> 34:16.233
but then I go and end up
sleeping with another woman.

34:16.233 --> 34:18.100
- God, that's such an easy
mistake to make, isn't it?

34:18.100 --> 34:19.600
I've done that twice
myself this morning.

34:19.600 --> 34:21.500
- With your mum?

34:23.300 --> 34:25.466
- Why in a million
years would she feel

34:25.466 --> 34:27.233
the same way about me?

34:28.132 --> 34:31.199
- Because he's kind,
sweet, funny, charming...

34:31.199 --> 34:32.000
- Handsome.

34:32.000 --> 34:33.433
- Very bloody handsome.

34:33.433 --> 34:36.065
- I bet he can go
for hours, too.

34:37.065 --> 34:39.966
- I don't know why,
but I just love him.

34:42.800 --> 34:44.400
- Then you have to tell him.

34:52.733 --> 34:55.533
- What I'd really like
to know is who invented

34:55.533 --> 34:57.966
this Monday to Friday
thing, you know?

34:58.033 --> 34:59.400
Who was the bloke
who first decided

34:59.400 --> 35:01.666
we need to spend five
days doing things

35:01.666 --> 35:03.066
we don't want to
do to earn money,

35:03.066 --> 35:04.566
so we can spend two days

35:04.566 --> 35:07.000
doing what we really want to
be doing the other five days,

35:07.000 --> 35:09.233
present company
excluded, of course.

35:09.233 --> 35:10.833
- It's just one of
those things, isn't it?

35:10.833 --> 35:12.266
I mean, who makes
these rules up?

35:12.266 --> 35:13.633
Who decided what
food is all right

35:13.633 --> 35:14.900
to eat for breakfast?

35:14.900 --> 35:17.133
Why can we have eggs,
sausages, and cereal,

35:17.133 --> 35:19.833
and not burger,
pizza, and a curry?

35:19.833 --> 35:21.566
- It's bollocks, you know?

35:21.566 --> 35:23.933
- Why do you never
see a chicken omelet?

35:23.933 --> 35:25.166
- Yeah.

35:25.166 --> 35:26.633
We're just brought up
with it, aren't we?

35:26.633 --> 35:28.533
It's passed down through the
generations like penis size

35:28.533 --> 35:32.633
or webbed feet or
webbed penises...?

35:35.133 --> 35:37.833
- Now, you really need
to get back out there.

35:37.833 --> 35:40.033
- Ah, can we not talk about
my life of loneliness,

35:40.033 --> 35:41.633
abstinence and despair?

35:41.633 --> 35:43.066
- What else are we
going to talk about?

35:43.066 --> 35:44.533
I'm not going to
spend all afternoon

35:44.533 --> 35:46.800
listening to you
talk about your ex.

35:46.800 --> 35:49.000
You need to look to the
future, not the past.

35:49.000 --> 35:50.400
- It was so good
at the beginning.

35:50.400 --> 35:51.600
- It always is.

35:51.600 --> 35:53.366
That's one of those girl games.

35:53.366 --> 35:56.000
They listen to you, tell
you how nice you are,

35:56.000 --> 35:57.600
that their last
boyfriend was a bastard.

35:57.600 --> 35:59.000
- I got that one.

35:59.000 --> 36:00.233
- And then they sense
they've got you believing

36:00.233 --> 36:02.466
they like you for
who you really are,

36:02.466 --> 36:03.900
and then bam!

36:03.900 --> 36:05.300
Suddenly they want
to change you to

36:05.300 --> 36:07.200
who they really like.

36:07.200 --> 36:08.700
Now they start
choosing your clothes.

36:08.700 --> 36:10.400
They buy you the
cologne they like.

36:10.400 --> 36:12.400
So they never really liked you.

36:12.400 --> 36:13.366
They were just trying
to see how easy

36:13.366 --> 36:15.166
it would be to mold you.

36:15.166 --> 36:17.766
- Jennifer did keep
suggesting I get a real job.

36:17.766 --> 36:19.400
- And you fought her well.

36:19.400 --> 36:20.800
- And what happened?

36:20.800 --> 36:23.533
- She couldn't mold you
into who she really wanted.

36:23.533 --> 36:25.166
I mean, haven't you ever
noticed the strange way

36:25.166 --> 36:28.333
all girls seem to have the
same DVDs in their collection?

36:28.333 --> 36:31.333
- You'll always find Pretty
Woman, Dirty Dancing.

36:31.333 --> 36:32.566
- [Luke] Ghost.

36:32.566 --> 36:33.633
- And there's always
a fucking fitness DVD

36:33.633 --> 36:34.866
you've never seen her use.

36:34.866 --> 36:36.033
- Yes, that's spooky.

36:36.033 --> 36:38.100
Maybe they're not
really DVDs inside.

36:38.100 --> 36:39.900
Maybe they're like
instructional tapes somehow

36:39.900 --> 36:41.333
to control us.

36:41.500 --> 36:42.933
- It would be the safest place.

36:42.933 --> 36:45.300
They know we're not going
to ask to borrow any of them

36:45.300 --> 36:47.300
to watch with the lads.

36:47.300 --> 36:49.266
Kind of like how
we hide our porn.

36:49.266 --> 36:51.166
- I kept mine in a
Driller Killer case.

36:51.166 --> 36:53.533
- Yeah, Zombie Flesh Eaters.

36:55.100 --> 36:57.366
- Hello, lover.

36:57.366 --> 36:59.500
- Talk of the bloody devil.

37:02.733 --> 37:06.066
- I came to see my
Valentine sweetheart.

37:06.066 --> 37:08.866
- Well, if I see
him, I'll warn him.

37:09.266 --> 37:12.366
- So what have you
planned for us tonight?

37:12.366 --> 37:14.633
- A trip to the psychiatrist.

37:15.633 --> 37:18.266
- I thought I'd make a romantic
dinner for two tonight.

37:18.266 --> 37:20.766
- Oh, I hope you're hungry.

37:21.300 --> 37:24.500
- I'm going to make
something for us special.

37:29.766 --> 37:32.366
- Suzy, it's over.

37:33.100 --> 37:34.600
- No, no.

37:42.866 --> 37:47.766
- That is one fucked up Fatal
Attraction, Basic Instinct,

37:47.766 --> 37:50.900
Hand that Rocks the
fucking Cradle looney!

37:50.900 --> 37:52.000
- I told you.

37:52.666 --> 37:54.266
- Right body though.

37:54.700 --> 37:56.366
Very nubile.

37:59.333 --> 38:01.400
- Right, another one?

38:01.400 --> 38:04.233
- No, I can't, I've got
to finish this book.

38:15.400 --> 38:17.566
- Hello. Hello, Luke.

38:17.566 --> 38:19.033
Hello pretty young girl.

38:19.033 --> 38:21.466
Hello piece of paper with
a phone number written on.

38:21.466 --> 38:23.166
What's going on?

38:23.166 --> 38:25.700
Nothing, I am bang
on track loser.

38:25.700 --> 38:27.666
This is just an
optical illusion.

38:27.666 --> 38:29.000
- See I told you, man.

38:29.000 --> 38:30.200
Was it that difficult?

38:30.200 --> 38:32.066
- No, it was remarkably
easy, actually,

38:32.066 --> 38:36.066
especially when she asked if
I could give you her number.

38:36.300 --> 38:37.200
- What?

38:37.200 --> 38:38.100
- She asked me

38:38.100 --> 38:40.066
to give you her number.

38:40.066 --> 38:42.300
So you manged to pull
her through proxy.

38:43.066 --> 38:44.900
- Well, I don't want it.

38:45.200 --> 38:47.466
- Oh, that's right.
You're in love.

38:48.100 --> 38:49.866
So tear it up.

38:51.133 --> 38:52.766
- No problem.

38:54.133 --> 38:55.166
- Come on, then, tear it up.

38:55.166 --> 38:56.566
- I will.

38:57.000 --> 38:58.233
- Go on, then.

39:00.100 --> 39:02.500
- Ah, I see, I knew
you couldn't do it.

39:02.833 --> 39:04.533
[dramatic orchestral music]

39:11.066 --> 39:11.800
- Done.

39:11.800 --> 39:13.066
- I'm impressed.

39:13.066 --> 39:14.600
- I feel good.

39:14.600 --> 39:16.666
I feel alive.

39:17.133 --> 39:19.933
I'm the king of the world.

39:20.000 --> 39:21.700
- Smile for the camera.

39:22.566 --> 39:23.733
What's that face for?

39:23.733 --> 39:24.866
I could swear to
god you just said,

39:24.866 --> 39:26.466
"I feel like the
king of the world."

39:26.466 --> 39:28.633
- I'm sick. I don't
know what I'm saying.

39:28.866 --> 39:30.066
- What are you looking at?

39:30.066 --> 39:31.466
You know, I'm not
a complete idiot.

39:31.466 --> 39:33.100
- No, not completely. Almost.

39:33.100 --> 39:34.466
- We'll see who's laughing
when I send this picture

39:34.466 --> 39:35.833
to the boss man.

39:35.833 --> 39:38.266
- You really are a sniveling,
burnout little shit.

39:38.400 --> 39:39.566
- You must be Luke.

39:39.566 --> 39:40.933
- Yeah, yeah. You
must be Jeri, Jeri.

39:40.933 --> 39:42.500
- No, it's Jeremy,

39:42.500 --> 39:44.600
and I'll see you bright
and early tomorrow morning.

39:44.666 --> 39:46.166
If you're leaving, bye.

39:48.866 --> 39:50.566
- What are you going to do?

39:50.566 --> 39:51.633
- Get a drink.

39:51.633 --> 39:52.600
- No, I can't.

39:52.600 --> 39:53.566
- Luke, don't give me that shit

39:53.566 --> 39:54.966
about going to the library.

39:54.966 --> 39:57.066
This is an emergency.

39:57.500 --> 39:59.833
- Then let's go get wasted.

40:00.400 --> 40:02.400
Who're you calling?

40:02.733 --> 40:04.433
- Reinforcements.

40:06.866 --> 40:08.466
[phone ringing]

40:08.766 --> 40:09.933
- [Voiceover] Angus!

40:10.066 --> 40:12.833
- Yeah, yeah, yo! Shoot.

40:14.266 --> 40:15.700
Yeah?

40:18.866 --> 40:20.400
Yeah, I understand.

40:20.633 --> 40:22.466
Yeah, I'll be, I'll
be, I'll be there.

40:23.666 --> 40:25.066
All right, I'm off.

40:25.066 --> 40:26.800
Laters, people.

40:27.066 --> 40:29.033
- Angus, this is not
a social media network

40:29.033 --> 40:31.233
where you can log off
and on at will, you know.

40:31.233 --> 40:32.666
There are scheduled hours here.

40:32.666 --> 40:34.533
- Like prison?

40:34.666 --> 40:35.966
Or work?

40:35.966 --> 40:38.866
Personally I come here
to get away from work

40:38.866 --> 40:40.200
and prison.

40:40.766 --> 40:42.766
We're students, meant to rebel.

40:43.266 --> 40:45.200
We got to have time
off for the hangovers

40:45.200 --> 40:46.800
and the cool-downs.

40:50.466 --> 40:53.033
We need time and space.

40:53.366 --> 40:56.766
We need to chill.

40:57.633 --> 40:59.800
- Just get the fuck out.

41:04.200 --> 41:05.966
- I'll always remain,

41:05.966 --> 41:08.000
underground [mumbles].

41:15.700 --> 41:16.666
[phone ringing]

41:16.666 --> 41:18.700
- Oh, that's... [mumbles].

41:19.400 --> 41:21.200
That's unhygienic.

41:21.633 --> 41:23.500
- Are you going to answer that?

41:27.300 --> 41:28.733
- My bills are fine.

41:28.733 --> 41:30.966
I haven't had an accident
in the last six months.

41:30.966 --> 41:33.000
I don't want to change
my energy supplier.

41:33.000 --> 41:35.133
I don't want to upgrade
my mobile phone,

41:35.133 --> 41:37.000
and I don't want to
attend your seminar,

41:37.000 --> 41:39.133
not even for a free toaster.

41:39.133 --> 41:40.900
Have I missed anything?

41:43.466 --> 41:44.566
Oh.

41:47.233 --> 41:48.600
It's Luke.

41:48.700 --> 41:50.766
Says he and Brady are going
to spend the afternoon

41:50.766 --> 41:52.100
on a pub crawl,

41:52.100 --> 41:54.733
and are kindly asking if
we'd like to join them.

41:57.733 --> 41:59.566
- Fuck it. Why not?

41:59.566 --> 42:01.300
I could do with a few pints.

42:01.400 --> 42:03.833
- I think we'll meet you later.

42:04.466 --> 42:06.600
- What the hell
are you looking at?

42:06.600 --> 42:09.433
- I'm going through
Angus's history.

42:09.433 --> 42:12.600
I believe this site's
called GILFs are Us.

42:15.566 --> 42:17.166
- I know they say to
respect your elders,

42:17.166 --> 42:20.133
but that is going too far.

42:20.133 --> 42:23.433
- Since when did a ten-inch
dildo spell respect?

42:26.066 --> 42:28.600
[upbeat music]

42:36.233 --> 42:38.166
- Wankers!

42:38.166 --> 42:39.800
- [Brady] Hello, sweet top.

42:39.866 --> 42:40.900
[laughs]

42:40.900 --> 42:41.666
- That is a mate.

42:41.666 --> 42:43.266
No fuss, no waiting.

42:43.266 --> 42:44.200
- I hope we didn't drag you away

42:44.200 --> 42:45.133
from anything important, buddy.

42:45.133 --> 42:46.833
- Nah, my balls fell out again,

42:46.833 --> 42:49.900
and I think I did something
wrong to a piece of cod.

42:50.033 --> 42:51.200
How was your day?

42:51.200 --> 42:53.566
- Possibly the
shittiest day ever.

42:53.566 --> 42:54.800
- I'll drink to that.

42:54.800 --> 42:57.366
Let's drink these up
and gab more, shall we?

43:09.533 --> 43:11.066
- Come on, guys.

43:11.066 --> 43:12.966
- That one's a bit gassy.

43:13.333 --> 43:14.500
[burp]

43:14.500 --> 43:15.733
- It's making me
cry a little bit.

43:15.733 --> 43:16.966
[laughing]

43:26.233 --> 43:28.300
Whew, I'm not even
finishing that.

43:28.300 --> 43:29.500
- I'm not leaving mine.

43:29.500 --> 43:31.366
- Come on, they're bitter.

43:31.366 --> 43:32.466
- Bitter moment.

43:32.466 --> 43:34.300
[laughing]

43:38.066 --> 43:39.700
You fucking pussy.

43:47.700 --> 43:50.266
- Right. How many girls
have you slept with?

43:50.266 --> 43:52.000
- Oh, I knew you'd
ask this question.

43:52.000 --> 43:53.600
Not as many as you, you slut.

43:53.600 --> 43:55.533
- And I want to hear names.

43:55.533 --> 43:56.566
- All right, you first.

43:56.566 --> 43:58.566
- No, I asked you.

43:58.666 --> 43:59.466
- So?

43:59.466 --> 44:01.066
- Yeah, so?

44:01.066 --> 44:02.333
- All right.

44:02.333 --> 44:04.166
I'll try to remember.

44:04.400 --> 44:06.533
Um, okay [clears throat].

What am I supposed to do?

- [Brady] Diane

- Oh, well done.

44:24.866 --> 44:25.700
- Edith

44:25.700 --> 44:27.300
- [Edith] Fuck me!

44:27.433 --> 44:28.233
- All right.

44:28.233 --> 44:29.200
- I was only on the Es.

44:29.200 --> 44:31.000
- Yeah, but we get the point.

44:31.233 --> 44:32.966
- All right, then,
come on, how many?

44:34.366 --> 44:36.000

really good, babe.

- You have to answer.

44:51.466 --> 44:52.466
- What about you?

44:52.466 --> 44:54.933
- I only do the D, K, Ps.

44:54.933 --> 44:56.000
- Like who?

44:56.000 --> 44:58.300
- There was Denise.

44:58.600 --> 45:00.866
- Are you sure
that's fully erect?

45:00.966 --> 45:02.400
- [Angus] There was Kayley.

45:02.400 --> 45:04.933
- Hurry up, babes, I've
got to get back to school.

45:04.933 --> 45:06.566
- Paulina.

45:06.566 --> 45:08.500
[dog panting]

45:08.500 --> 45:10.233
I'm not sure she even counts.

45:10.433 --> 45:11.633
- All right, one.

45:11.633 --> 45:12.933
I slept with one girl.

45:12.933 --> 45:14.166
- Who is it?

45:14.166 --> 45:15.100
- What do you mean, who was it?

45:15.100 --> 45:16.433
Including Jennifer, of course.

45:17.600 --> 45:20.500
- You slept with one
including Jennifer?

45:20.500 --> 45:21.300
- Yeah.

45:21.300 --> 45:22.266
- That's fucking tragic.

45:22.266 --> 45:23.233
- What do you mean?

45:23.233 --> 45:25.833
We were together for five years.

45:25.933 --> 45:28.100
- That means you
were a virgin until--

45:28.100 --> 45:29.466
[laughing]

45:30.766 --> 45:33.100
- All right, just get
the fucking drinks.

45:33.100 --> 45:34.300
It's your round, Angus.

45:34.300 --> 45:36.300
- I got these.

45:36.300 --> 45:37.233
- I got these.

45:37.233 --> 45:38.200
- I got the ones before.

45:38.200 --> 45:39.133
- Fuck you.

45:39.133 --> 45:40.466
- Say it again.

45:40.466 --> 45:43.900
You were a virgin until
you were twenty-two.

45:43.900 --> 45:46.600
- Just please get
the fucking drinks.

45:47.866 --> 45:48.766
- Hey, you know what?

45:48.766 --> 45:49.666
Forget about it, man.

45:49.666 --> 45:51.333
In some ways, I'm jealous.

45:51.333 --> 45:53.433
- In what ways?

45:54.066 --> 45:55.033
- Okay, in no ways.

45:55.033 --> 45:55.866
But you know what? So what.

45:55.866 --> 45:57.133
So it's not a top score.

45:57.133 --> 45:59.066
I've lost interest and
had to fake orgasms

45:59.066 --> 46:00.400
to get away early.

46:00.400 --> 46:01.400
[laughs]

46:01.400 --> 46:02.366
- What are you talking about?

46:02.366 --> 46:03.866
Men can't fake an orgasm.

46:03.866 --> 46:05.566
- Yeah, of course we can.

46:05.566 --> 46:07.333
- How do you fake an orgasm?

46:07.333 --> 46:09.166
- You know, you just act.

46:09.166 --> 46:10.800
- Bullshit.

46:13.866 --> 46:15.200
[clears throat]

46:16.333 --> 46:18.000
[moans]

46:18.000 --> 46:20.400
- Yeah, yeah there.

46:20.666 --> 46:22.233
[moans]

46:23.000 --> 46:24.533
There, there.

46:24.666 --> 46:26.100
Oh, all day, yeah.

46:26.100 --> 46:27.033
[moans]

46:27.033 --> 46:29.566
Nearly, nearly, nearly, oh yeah.

46:29.566 --> 46:32.500
Yeah, oh, oh, oh yes!

46:32.600 --> 46:34.266
Nearly!

46:34.633 --> 46:35.666
I'm hearing

46:35.666 --> 46:37.900
angels sing!

46:37.900 --> 46:41.966
Just like your sister!

46:42.333 --> 46:43.733
[moans]

46:46.966 --> 46:49.166
- I'll have three pints
of what he's having.

47:04.333 --> 47:06.300
[humming]

47:18.333 --> 47:20.033
- Was tense with
mostly wide eyes.

47:20.033 --> 47:21.633
It's not big ...
it's not clever.

47:21.833 --> 47:23.666
[Brady groans]

47:24.700 --> 47:26.533
- [Angus] Here we go!

47:26.533 --> 47:28.666
Round and round again.

47:29.433 --> 47:30.866
Yay!

47:33.600 --> 47:36.133
- [Luke] Now this is the
tough part of the whole day.

47:36.333 --> 47:37.533
This is where you start lagging.

47:37.533 --> 47:39.166
You feel a bit tired.

47:39.166 --> 47:40.666
You consider going home

47:40.666 --> 47:42.100
and crashing in front of the
TV for the rest of the night,

47:42.100 --> 47:44.200
but you can't.

47:44.800 --> 47:48.300
You've spent too much
time, effort, and money

47:48.300 --> 47:50.433
into getting this wrecked.

47:50.500 --> 47:52.233
It's gonna be a
shame to waste it.

47:52.633 --> 47:53.866
- [Luke] I gotta pee.

47:53.866 --> 47:56.033
- [Brady] Guys, I think
I need to go to work.

47:56.633 --> 47:58.100
- [Angus] What?
You're joking, Romeo.

47:58.100 --> 47:59.166
- I'll catch you [mumbles].

48:00.566 --> 48:02.133
- I've really got to pee.

48:02.133 --> 48:03.833
- What, shall I
wait here, should I?

48:07.333 --> 48:08.166
[splat]

48:37.600 --> 48:39.800
[lively, rock music]

49:00.733 --> 49:02.233
[yawns]

49:04.766 --> 49:06.200
- Fuck.

49:07.866 --> 49:09.133
Come on. Come on, come on.

49:18.033 --> 49:18.933
Fuck.

49:23.333 --> 49:24.800
Come on. Come on. Come on.

49:27.966 --> 49:30.100
I knew I shouldn't have
had that last pint.

49:37.566 --> 49:39.200
[panting]

49:39.966 --> 49:41.500
- What's wrong with you?

49:41.500 --> 49:43.933
- There was a tall killer
like the one from my book,

49:43.933 --> 49:45.933
chasing me while I was pissing.

49:47.666 --> 49:49.133
- I just licked shit.

49:52.300 --> 49:53.566
Want some?

50:15.133 --> 50:17.200
- I think you're a
little late for work.

50:17.200 --> 50:18.733
- Better late than never.

50:18.733 --> 50:20.133
- And he's drunk, sir.

50:21.366 --> 50:23.233
- That makes this all very easy.

50:23.233 --> 50:25.500
- Woah, woah. Wait a minute.

50:25.500 --> 50:27.800
I've got something to say.

50:27.800 --> 50:30.866
Shut the fuck up. No one
cares what you think.

50:31.866 --> 50:35.433
I have in my hand,
my resignation.

50:36.166 --> 50:39.233
I won't be sacked
from a job I detest.

50:39.633 --> 50:42.066
I've done sat behind
that fucking typewriter

50:42.066 --> 50:44.000
for way too long,

50:44.000 --> 50:47.066
and I'm setting myself free.

50:47.066 --> 50:48.133
God knows what I'll do,

50:48.133 --> 50:49.933
or where I'll go,

50:49.933 --> 50:53.833
but I know it'll be
better than this.

50:54.933 --> 50:56.566
This job.

50:58.200 --> 50:59.633
[honks]

51:00.166 --> 51:01.866
- Please get rid of him, sir.

51:01.866 --> 51:03.533
- Oh, shut up, Jeri.

51:03.533 --> 51:05.100
And put a tie on.

51:11.200 --> 51:12.800
[knocking]

51:12.800 --> 51:13.900
- Ariel.

51:15.766 --> 51:17.100
Ariel.

51:17.800 --> 51:19.100
Ariel.

51:22.200 --> 51:24.233
[snoring]

51:37.333 --> 51:38.733
You were asleep.

51:38.733 --> 51:39.966
[laughs]

51:39.966 --> 51:41.966
- I was in a deep,
meditative state,

51:41.966 --> 51:44.700
touring worlds beyond our own.

51:44.700 --> 51:47.233
- Sounded a lot like
you were asleep.

51:47.433 --> 51:48.566
I made tea.

51:48.566 --> 51:50.100
- Oh, gasping.

51:51.100 --> 51:53.233
- So, I've been thinking.

51:53.233 --> 51:55.800
- Wait, let me guess.

51:56.366 --> 51:57.633
Brady.

51:57.933 --> 52:00.233
- Do you think I should
try and be a bit more...

52:00.233 --> 52:01.500
girly.

52:01.733 --> 52:03.666
- What, like pigtails girly?

52:03.666 --> 52:05.766
Or breast-implants girly?

52:05.766 --> 52:07.533
- Neither, prefarably.

52:07.533 --> 52:10.300
I was thinking, maybe, a dress.

52:12.766 --> 52:15.600
- Let me tell you about men.

52:15.866 --> 52:17.733
They are not like us.

52:17.733 --> 52:19.700
We have five senses,

52:19.700 --> 52:21.000
some of us have six,

52:21.000 --> 52:22.866
but most people just five.

52:22.866 --> 52:26.300
Hearing, smell, touch, sight,

52:26.300 --> 52:29.400
and my personal favorite, taste.

52:29.766 --> 52:32.333
Women use all five
senses at once.

52:32.333 --> 52:34.133
They love to mix and match.

52:34.133 --> 52:36.633
Men can use just one at a time.

52:36.633 --> 52:38.933
Their first sense is sight.

52:38.933 --> 52:40.600
They are visual beings.

52:40.600 --> 52:43.266
Now, you want it to go
deeper than just sight,

52:43.266 --> 52:47.433
but if you can, and I'll use
an analogy you'll understand,

52:47.866 --> 52:50.466
if you can hook him with sight,

52:50.466 --> 52:53.300
then you can reel
him in using smell,

52:53.300 --> 52:55.766
touch, and of course, taste,

52:55.766 --> 52:57.566
and then once you've caught him,

52:57.566 --> 53:00.233
you can hit him
with the hearing.

53:01.200 --> 53:03.333
So, is that a yes?

53:03.333 --> 53:05.300
Should I wear a dress, or?

53:05.300 --> 53:09.300
- In my opinion,
why the fuck not?

53:12.033 --> 53:13.266
[laughs]

53:13.266 --> 53:16.866
- I feel so good,
fan-fucking-tastic.

53:17.633 --> 53:19.933
- You should've taken a dump.

53:19.933 --> 53:21.333
- What?

53:21.333 --> 53:23.066
- Yeah, yeah, you should've
pulled down your pants,

53:23.066 --> 53:24.500
squirted a little, had
a shit in your hands,

53:24.500 --> 53:26.166
and throwed it at their
faces and the walls.

53:26.166 --> 53:27.400
They agree.

53:27.400 --> 53:30.000
- I'm not sure he needed
to go that far, Angus.

53:30.000 --> 53:31.233
- You can never go too far

53:31.233 --> 53:33.866
and those approaches
the ultimate fuck you.

53:34.300 --> 53:36.466
- But then I have
shit on my hand.

53:36.466 --> 53:38.166
- Yeah, that's a metaphor.

53:38.166 --> 53:39.566
- For what?

53:39.566 --> 53:41.766
- All these years they've
been giving him shit.

53:41.766 --> 53:44.000
Now the tables are turned.

53:44.000 --> 53:45.166
Yeah.

53:45.166 --> 53:48.400
- Nah, you' re a
dirty bastard, Angus.

53:49.066 --> 53:50.100
- Yeah, it's all
been a witch hour.

53:50.100 --> 53:51.433
I have to go see Willy Wonka.

53:51.433 --> 53:52.600
I feel the Oompa-Loompa's
about to come in.

53:54.133 --> 53:56.733
- Hey, don't throw
your poop at anyone.

53:57.966 --> 53:59.333
- Poop?

54:06.966 --> 54:08.366
[knocks]

54:08.766 --> 54:10.133
- Hello?

54:11.066 --> 54:13.800
I'm ready to come
to Log Central.

54:14.733 --> 54:15.900
[groans]

54:17.533 --> 54:19.266
[gags]

54:21.933 --> 54:23.500
[mumbles]

54:23.966 --> 54:25.466
I can taste that.

54:27.833 --> 54:29.366
[groans]

54:32.900 --> 54:34.366
[coughs]

54:34.733 --> 54:36.600
I've seen worse.

54:40.500 --> 54:41.500
- Oops.

54:41.500 --> 54:42.900
- [mumbles]

54:47.566 --> 54:49.966
[sentimental rock music]

55:03.266 --> 55:05.833
- I was as thirsty as a
fish in a barrel of piss.

55:06.233 --> 55:08.266
You've been drinking all day?

55:08.566 --> 55:11.100
- I suddenly feel
stone-cold sober.

55:11.966 --> 55:13.566
- Like the dress?

55:13.566 --> 55:15.533
- Yeah, you look...

55:16.333 --> 55:17.566
different.

55:19.333 --> 55:21.666
- Get many cards this morning?

55:21.666 --> 55:23.000
- I didn't count them.

55:23.000 --> 55:24.266
- Any good ones?

55:24.266 --> 55:26.266
- I didn't open them.

55:26.266 --> 55:27.866
- What did you do with them?

55:27.866 --> 55:29.733
- Threw them in the bin.

55:29.733 --> 55:31.333
- Why?

55:31.333 --> 55:33.633
- I don't care about
any of those girls.

55:33.633 --> 55:36.633
I don't want to spend
my life with them.

55:36.633 --> 55:39.166
I don't love them.

55:39.800 --> 55:42.366
I want... [laughs]

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
I want...

55:45.133 --> 55:47.033
- What?

55:47.266 --> 55:48.966
I want...

55:49.400 --> 55:52.233
another drink, is what I want.

55:53.566 --> 55:54.766
- How was work today?

55:54.766 --> 55:56.966
Oh, I forgot, you
don't have a job.

55:56.966 --> 55:58.933
- Well, why should I have a job?

55:58.933 --> 56:00.866
Half my wages will
go towards you

56:00.866 --> 56:03.866
spending at university
experiencing life.

56:03.866 --> 56:06.066
- It's called an education.

56:06.066 --> 56:08.333
They teach you words
like that at university.

56:08.333 --> 56:09.566
- Oh, do they? Do they?

56:09.566 --> 56:11.100
I just thought they
taught you words like,

56:11.100 --> 56:11.900
pfffft,

56:11.900 --> 56:12.800
slacker,

56:12.800 --> 56:15.100
and... cannabis.

56:15.700 --> 56:18.233
- Oh, I almost forgot, Luke.

56:18.233 --> 56:20.600
I saw a job offer in the paper.

56:20.600 --> 56:23.400
Penthouse, looking for full-time
professional masturbators,

56:23.400 --> 56:27.533
and I immediately thought,
"You're a wanker."

56:28.300 --> 56:29.966
- The day I use the pub toilets,

56:29.966 --> 56:31.833
even the bins are doing this.

56:33.666 --> 56:36.400
I'm saying we should
go to get a kebob now.

56:36.400 --> 56:37.333
- [Luke] Yes, yes,

56:37.333 --> 56:38.600
kabobs, kabobs, kabobs.

56:38.600 --> 56:40.633
I got to refuel
before we drink more.

56:40.633 --> 56:41.800
- [Angus] Very wise.

56:41.800 --> 56:43.200
- Listen to you bunch
of little girls.

56:43.200 --> 56:45.300
I thought geezers like
you could drink like fish?

56:45.300 --> 56:47.566
- No, we are not geezers.

56:47.566 --> 56:49.166
We are gentlemen drinkers,

56:49.166 --> 56:51.166
and we are pacing ourselves.

56:51.166 --> 56:52.700
- Yeah, well, we'll skip it,

56:52.700 --> 56:54.666
and see you at the party.

56:55.000 --> 56:55.866
Come on.

56:56.433 --> 56:57.433
- See you later?

56:58.266 --> 56:59.566
- I promise.

57:03.766 --> 57:05.200
- Did you see his face?

57:05.200 --> 57:06.833
It worked like a dream.

57:06.833 --> 57:08.433
- You think so?

57:08.433 --> 57:11.066
- I'm starting to feel
my mojo returning.

57:11.066 --> 57:13.700
- Well, my mojo is fucking
freezing in this dress.

57:13.700 --> 57:15.466
Let's get going.

57:17.933 --> 57:19.400
- What? Pfffft.

57:22.066 --> 57:23.433
You look different.

57:23.433 --> 57:24.200
[laughs]

57:24.200 --> 57:25.133
- No, he doesn't.

57:25.133 --> 57:26.966
- No, that's his shitty line.

57:26.966 --> 57:28.133
- What?

57:28.133 --> 57:29.900
- You really knocked
Fred off her feet.

57:29.900 --> 57:31.666
- What would you know
about knocking girls

57:31.666 --> 57:33.100
off their feet?

57:33.100 --> 57:34.600
Jennifer kicked
you in the balls,

57:34.600 --> 57:37.166
and you've been crying over
her for the last six weeks.

57:37.166 --> 57:38.400
- All right, let's
just chill, dudes.

57:38.400 --> 57:40.500
- No, I want to hear
Luke's brilliant advice

57:40.500 --> 57:42.133
on how to handle my love life.

57:42.133 --> 57:43.366
- Love life?

57:43.366 --> 57:44.133
No, you've got that
the wrong way around.

57:44.133 --> 57:45.233
You have a sex life,

57:45.233 --> 57:46.366
but you don't have a love life.

57:46.366 --> 57:47.766
- Oh, well, at
least I have that.

57:47.766 --> 57:49.133
You don't have either.

57:49.133 --> 57:51.066
- Well, I'm so flipping sorry

57:51.066 --> 57:54.466
that I'm not on some quest
to shag every girl I see.

57:54.466 --> 57:56.566
- Well, maybe you should be.

57:56.566 --> 57:58.300
Maybe it would help you realize

57:58.300 --> 58:00.200
that the one you had is gone.

58:00.200 --> 58:01.633
She left you.

58:01.633 --> 58:02.833
Move on.

58:02.833 --> 58:04.233
- Let's just chill
and get some food.

58:04.233 --> 58:05.966
- In a minute, I
just want to say,

58:05.966 --> 58:08.833
you're a selifish
piece of shit, you are,

58:08.833 --> 58:10.466
who doesn't deserve
a girl like Fred.

58:10.466 --> 58:12.633
- And you do, is that
what you're saying?

58:12.633 --> 58:14.833
- No, but I'm not the one
who's in love with Fred.

58:14.833 --> 58:16.933
Let's face it, you probably
only just want to knob her

58:16.933 --> 58:19.600
because she's off
around the world.

58:19.866 --> 58:21.133
- Fuck you.

58:21.133 --> 58:22.266
- It's true. It's true.

58:22.266 --> 58:23.733
You don't want somebody leaving

58:23.733 --> 58:28.000
without having tried out this
bloody, blah, sex machine.

58:28.733 --> 58:30.633
- Yeah, well maybe I should
have shagged Jennifer,

58:30.633 --> 58:32.500
because you obviously
weren't doing it right.

58:32.500 --> 58:33.300
- Prick!

58:33.300 --> 58:34.500
- [Angus] Ow!

58:34.566 --> 58:35.566
- [Brady] What are you doing?

58:35.566 --> 58:36.266
- You fucking....

58:36.266 --> 58:37.466
- No, he did it.

58:37.466 --> 58:38.600
- Who?

58:38.600 --> 58:39.733
- Luke.

58:44.166 --> 58:45.700
[laughs]

59:00.133 --> 59:01.933
[balloon pops]

59:08.833 --> 59:11.600
[sentimental rock music]

59:20.866 --> 59:23.266
- Oh, I think there's
a hair in mine.

59:24.366 --> 59:26.033
- It's your mum.

59:26.033 --> 59:28.200
- [Luke] At some point
during the ordeal,

59:28.200 --> 59:29.600
you have to have

59:29.600 --> 59:31.300
a kebab pitstop.

59:31.300 --> 59:33.966
It's absolutely essential
to the evening portion,

59:33.966 --> 59:36.766
and, while many people wait
until the very end of the night,

59:36.766 --> 59:38.933
which is quite
frankly ludicrous,

59:38.933 --> 59:41.533
you're barely going to
remember what you've eaten.

59:41.533 --> 59:43.466
I have mine about half
eight, nine o'clock,

59:43.466 --> 59:47.333
then I can relatively
recall what was in it,

59:47.633 --> 59:50.133
some kind of, you
know, generic meat.

59:50.266 --> 59:51.866
- What the fuck is that?

59:51.866 --> 59:53.066
- It's your cock.

59:53.066 --> 59:54.566
[laughs]

59:57.433 --> 59:59.133
- Oh, Brady.

01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:03.233
- [Luke] Another
ritual of the drunk

01:00:03.233 --> 01:00:04.966
is to make phone calls

01:00:04.966 --> 01:00:07.466
to exactly the wrong person.

01:00:07.466 --> 01:00:10.866
For instance, and,
this is most offensive,

01:00:10.866 --> 01:00:12.566
the ex.

01:00:12.966 --> 01:00:14.400
It's a bad idea.

01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:16.066
You know it's a bad idea,

01:00:16.066 --> 01:00:17.933
but you have no choice.

01:00:20.266 --> 01:00:21.833
- Dinner is served.

01:00:23.933 --> 01:00:25.333
- Yes, yes, yes.

01:00:34.866 --> 01:00:36.000
- So.

01:00:36.466 --> 01:00:38.266
Come on, truth.

01:00:38.466 --> 01:00:40.766
How many boys have
you slept with?

01:00:40.766 --> 01:00:41.800
Truth, remember.

01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:43.100
- I don't want to play anymore.

01:00:43.100 --> 01:00:44.533
- You're such a nun.

01:00:44.533 --> 01:00:46.700
- Well, how many
have you slept with?

01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:48.633
- There was Michael.

01:00:48.633 --> 01:00:49.733
[squeaks]

01:00:49.833 --> 01:00:50.800
Jean.

01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:51.933
[grunts]

01:00:51.933 --> 01:00:52.700
Mark.

01:00:52.700 --> 01:00:53.800
- Bingo!

01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:55.033
- Another Mark.

01:00:55.033 --> 01:00:55.766
[grunts]

01:00:55.766 --> 01:00:56.900
Patrace.

01:00:56.900 --> 01:00:57.933
[breathes]

01:00:57.933 --> 01:00:59.366
Billy and Dana.

01:01:00.666 --> 01:01:01.933
[laughs] That was a threesome.

01:01:01.933 --> 01:01:03.066
Another Mark.

01:01:03.066 --> 01:01:04.000
- All right, all
right, you old slapper.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:05.100
I've heard enough.

01:01:05.100 --> 01:01:07.100
- And, of course, Yogi.

01:01:07.100 --> 01:01:08.566
[Indian music]

01:01:08.566 --> 01:01:10.933
- What're you going
to do about him?

01:01:10.933 --> 01:01:12.266
- I'm still waiting.

01:01:12.266 --> 01:01:13.400
- For what?

01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:16.100
- The sign, some
divine intervention.

01:01:16.333 --> 01:01:18.566
- Maybe it's not about
some higher power.

01:01:18.566 --> 01:01:21.900
Maybe it's about you
deciding what's best for you.

01:01:41.700 --> 01:01:43.166
- What happened to your eye?

01:01:43.166 --> 01:01:44.566
- Luke done it.

01:01:44.566 --> 01:01:45.833
- He punched you?

01:01:45.833 --> 01:01:47.066
- It was a drunken accident.

01:01:47.066 --> 01:01:48.166
It was meant to be for Brady.

01:01:48.166 --> 01:01:49.366
- Why, what did you do?

01:01:49.366 --> 01:01:50.333
- Nothing.

01:01:50.333 --> 01:01:51.700
- They had a drunken argument,

01:01:51.700 --> 01:01:54.166
and now the little petulant
bitches are sulking.

01:01:54.166 --> 01:01:55.766
- I'm not sulking.

01:01:55.766 --> 01:01:56.966
It's him.

01:01:56.966 --> 01:01:58.900
- You boys are so
bloody childish.

01:01:58.900 --> 01:02:01.666
A couple of pints and you
want to smack your best mate.

01:02:01.666 --> 01:02:03.100
Why don't you just apologize?

01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:04.200
No harm done.

01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:05.733
- Except for my eye.

01:02:05.733 --> 01:02:07.366
- You in a major [mumbles]?

01:02:07.366 --> 01:02:08.900
- No.

01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:10.600
- Oh, obviously not.

01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:13.666
- I'll get another round then.

01:02:13.666 --> 01:02:14.933
- [Ariel] I'll help.
- [Brady] I'll go.

01:02:14.933 --> 01:02:16.766
- I'm already standing.

01:02:17.666 --> 01:02:19.666
- Mine's a G and T, please.

01:02:19.666 --> 01:02:21.433
- Sex on the beach, please.

01:02:22.100 --> 01:02:23.033
Or a pint.

01:02:23.633 --> 01:02:24.900
- Pint.

01:02:32.866 --> 01:02:33.600
- Don't touch me.

01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:34.633
- All right.

01:02:34.633 --> 01:02:35.966
Just thought I'd try.

01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:37.333
I'll tell you what,

01:02:37.333 --> 01:02:38.633
that kebab sobered me right up.

01:02:38.633 --> 01:02:39.633
- [Ariel] It's made
your breath stink,

01:02:39.633 --> 01:02:41.033
is what it's done.

01:02:41.033 --> 01:02:43.600
- Oh, well, Ariel, that's
the thing with kebabs.

01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:45.666
The taste will last for hours.

01:02:46.300 --> 01:02:48.233
[sing-songs]

01:02:48.233 --> 01:02:51.966
- Oh, that's ... that's rank.

01:02:52.566 --> 01:02:54.366
That's not cooking.

01:03:01.133 --> 01:03:03.066
- So why are you
and Luke arguing?

01:03:03.066 --> 01:03:04.966
- Oh, it's nothing, nevermind.

01:03:04.966 --> 01:03:07.466
- Hey, listen, I wanted
to talk about us.

01:03:07.466 --> 01:03:08.733
- There's an us?

01:03:08.733 --> 01:03:10.366
- How long have we
known each other?

01:03:10.366 --> 01:03:12.133
- A long, long time.

01:03:12.133 --> 01:03:14.800
- So, I mean, don't you think
it's time we got together?

01:03:16.233 --> 01:03:17.466
- You mean, you think
we should have one night

01:03:17.466 --> 01:03:19.966
to rampant shagging
so you can ignore me,

01:03:19.966 --> 01:03:21.966
like you usually
do the other girls.

01:03:22.933 --> 01:03:24.833
- I really like you, Fred.

01:03:24.900 --> 01:03:26.933
- What can I get you two?

01:03:27.166 --> 01:03:30.366
- Oh, do you do
sex on the beach?

01:03:30.366 --> 01:03:31.800
- No, not in a while.

01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:33.900
It's car parks,
mostly, nowadays.

01:03:34.900 --> 01:03:36.200
Are you drunk?

01:03:37.333 --> 01:03:41.066
- Um, uh... two pints of lager,

01:03:41.066 --> 01:03:44.666
a G and T, Guiness,
and a cider, please.

01:03:44.666 --> 01:03:46.066
- Coming up.

01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:50.300
- So...

01:03:51.166 --> 01:03:52.566
- So what?

01:03:52.766 --> 01:03:54.200
- I thought you might
have something to say

01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:55.833
about you and me?

01:03:57.266 --> 01:03:59.733
- How do I know you're serious?

01:03:59.966 --> 01:04:01.600
- I'll become celibate.

01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:03.666
No sex, nothing
until you believe me.

01:04:03.666 --> 01:04:05.733
- Wow, very fucking romantic.

01:04:07.033 --> 01:04:08.600
- You're not like other girls.

01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:09.866
- I know.

01:04:09.966 --> 01:04:11.933
I know, I'm like
one of the lads.

01:04:11.933 --> 01:04:14.533
- No, that's not what I meant.

01:04:15.066 --> 01:04:18.633
- Why? What's so
special about me?

01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:23.033
- What's special is
I care about you.

01:04:23.433 --> 01:04:24.500
- Shit.

01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:25.266
- What?

01:04:25.266 --> 01:04:26.533
- Look who's here.

01:04:31.066 --> 01:04:33.000
- Oh, fucking shit.

01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:36.000
What is Jennifer doing
here with that prick?

01:04:42.333 --> 01:04:43.666
- Luke.

01:04:43.866 --> 01:04:45.066
- What?

01:04:46.900 --> 01:04:48.400
- Present for you,
there's a little rose.

01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:50.866
- Thank you. That's lovely.

01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:54.766
- Just ignore her.

01:04:58.600 --> 01:05:00.733
- I can't believe you're waving.

01:05:01.333 --> 01:05:02.800
- That bitch.

01:05:03.033 --> 01:05:04.833
[laughs]

01:05:05.300 --> 01:05:05.900
- Oh.

01:05:05.900 --> 01:05:07.433
- Sorry.

01:05:08.133 --> 01:05:09.600
I'm dribbling.

01:05:10.666 --> 01:05:12.500
Just going to the loo.

01:05:12.866 --> 01:05:14.400
- Oh!

01:05:14.566 --> 01:05:15.833
- [Fred] Here we go.

01:05:17.233 --> 01:05:18.633
- Bastard.

01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:20.300
- You spotted him then.

01:05:20.300 --> 01:05:21.133
- He waved.

01:05:21.133 --> 01:05:22.133
- You didn't.

01:05:22.133 --> 01:05:23.333
- [Ariel] He did.

01:05:23.333 --> 01:05:25.566
She smiled to him,
and he waved back.

01:05:25.566 --> 01:05:27.000
- You fucking cunt.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:28.600
- Oh, Jesus, it was just a wave.

01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:29.933
What was I supposed to do?

01:05:29.933 --> 01:05:31.466
- You could've stuck
two fingers up at her.

01:05:31.466 --> 01:05:33.733
- Yeah, I think you're
talking about the one finger.

01:05:33.733 --> 01:05:35.833
- [Ariel] I prefer to
keep it old school.

01:05:35.833 --> 01:05:37.233
- Can't believe she's
got the throat to bring

01:05:37.233 --> 01:05:39.666
Jeri on a date to my pub.

01:05:39.666 --> 01:05:41.166
- On Valentine's Day?

01:05:41.166 --> 01:05:42.766
- She must've known
you were here.

01:05:42.766 --> 01:05:44.366
- This tops off
my day perfectly.

01:05:44.366 --> 01:05:46.033
Pissed off when I woke up.

01:05:46.033 --> 01:05:47.766
Now I'll go back to bed
even more pissed off.

01:05:47.766 --> 01:05:49.200
- No, man,

01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:52.633
you people know nothing
about the human condition.

01:05:52.633 --> 01:05:55.033
You called her and
hung up, didn't you?

01:05:55.033 --> 01:05:56.766
Didn't you?

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:58.066
- Maybe.

01:05:58.066 --> 01:06:00.266
- Classic kebab moves.

01:06:00.766 --> 01:06:03.466
A person tries to contact
their ex and bottles it.

01:06:03.466 --> 01:06:04.733
She's got your number up,

01:06:04.733 --> 01:06:05.966
and she's thinking,

01:06:05.966 --> 01:06:09.200
"Why on Valentine's
Day is he calling me?"

01:06:09.333 --> 01:06:10.833
She knows that you come here,

01:06:10.833 --> 01:06:12.966
ergo she comes to see you.

01:06:13.133 --> 01:06:15.833
Classic humanoid pattern.

01:06:15.966 --> 01:06:17.666
- So why bring a date?

01:06:17.666 --> 01:06:19.100
- Total basic instinct,

01:06:19.100 --> 01:06:20.633
survival of the fittest,

01:06:20.633 --> 01:06:23.866
or the female of the
species teasing the male

01:06:23.866 --> 01:06:25.566
like fuck.

01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:27.900
- I don't know bollocks
here that he spoke,

01:06:27.900 --> 01:06:29.766
he's just going to have
to fuck up her night.

01:06:29.766 --> 01:06:30.733
- Thank you.

01:06:30.733 --> 01:06:31.966
- She's right.

01:06:31.966 --> 01:06:33.366
He needs to up the ante.

01:06:33.366 --> 01:06:35.500
How about a round
of vodka shots?

01:06:35.500 --> 01:06:38.100
- Are you sure
that's a good idea?

01:06:38.100 --> 01:06:39.700
- I'm fine for Dino.

01:06:40.366 --> 01:06:42.300
- All right, let
me start the slash.

01:06:45.033 --> 01:06:46.766
- Nice.

01:06:48.966 --> 01:06:50.966
- So...

01:06:51.966 --> 01:06:55.266
are you two going to sit like
Sooty and Sweet all night?

01:06:55.633 --> 01:06:56.666
- I'm all right.

01:06:59.166 --> 01:07:00.833
- What's that sweetie?

01:07:01.966 --> 01:07:03.166
- Yes.

01:07:04.266 --> 01:07:05.033
- Thanks, Matthew.

01:07:05.033 --> 01:07:06.433
- No problems, Lou.

01:07:21.633 --> 01:07:22.833
- We need to talk.

01:07:22.833 --> 01:07:23.766
- This isn't the best time.

01:07:23.766 --> 01:07:25.533
- It's important.

01:07:26.566 --> 01:07:28.600
- We have a problem.

01:07:28.733 --> 01:07:30.566
I'm not happy.

01:07:31.733 --> 01:07:33.633
- Well, I think--

01:07:33.633 --> 01:07:35.500
- Please let me speak.

01:07:38.666 --> 01:07:41.333
I'm not happy with us,

01:07:41.333 --> 01:07:43.700
with our relationship.

01:07:43.833 --> 01:07:46.033
I thought we had
something special, but...

01:07:46.033 --> 01:07:48.466
I don't know if I
love you anymore.

01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:52.400
- Oh, right, right.

01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:55.066
Well, if you're sure.

01:07:57.933 --> 01:07:59.333
- I know you don't
want to hear it,

01:07:59.333 --> 01:08:02.000
but we can't be
together anymore.

01:08:03.033 --> 01:08:06.400
But it can't be over before
I give you something.

01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:10.100
[kiss]

01:08:12.733 --> 01:08:13.466
[thud]

01:08:13.466 --> 01:08:14.433
[grunt]

01:08:15.366 --> 01:08:17.332
[harp music]

01:08:25.332 --> 01:08:27.066
- What the hell?

01:08:27.233 --> 01:08:29.033
- Quite the opposite.

01:08:29.366 --> 01:08:30.733
Welcome, Brady.

01:08:30.733 --> 01:08:32.033
- Where am I?

01:08:32.033 --> 01:08:34.166
- You're dead.

01:08:34.166 --> 01:08:35.233
[laughs]

01:08:35.233 --> 01:08:36.466
Just kidding.

01:08:36.466 --> 01:08:38.866
You're here because I
wanted a word with you.

01:08:38.866 --> 01:08:40.933
- With me? Why?

01:08:40.933 --> 01:08:45.200
- Look, I know how hot
and sexy women can be.

01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:48.733
I created them
for Christ's sake,

01:08:49.433 --> 01:08:53.100
but I think it's time
to stop bedsurfing.

01:08:54.100 --> 01:08:56.265
- I've messed it up
with Fred, haven't I?

01:08:56.265 --> 01:08:58.200
- Do you love her?

01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:00.832
- Oh, absolutely.

01:09:00.933 --> 01:09:02.832
- Then don't give up so easy.

01:09:02.832 --> 01:09:05.200
- Yeah, you're right.

01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:07.733
Hey, can I ask one question?

01:09:07.733 --> 01:09:10.466
- As long as it's not
about me and Mary.

01:09:10.765 --> 01:09:12.166
- Nah, forget about it.

01:09:12.166 --> 01:09:14.066
I better get back to Earth
and sort my life out.

01:09:14.066 --> 01:09:15.566
- Okay.

01:09:16.166 --> 01:09:20.000
Expecto patronum!

01:09:21.066 --> 01:09:22.500
Just kidding.

01:09:23.765 --> 01:09:25.100
[grunts]

01:09:25.366 --> 01:09:26.600
[groans]

01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:28.200
- You okay, mate?

01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:31.600
- Oh, I must have fainted.

01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:33.200
- Yeah, you did.

01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:35.033
Just after the punch.

01:09:35.033 --> 01:09:36.500
- What punch?

01:09:36.500 --> 01:09:38.899
- Fred saw you kissing
Suzy so she lumped you.

01:09:38.899 --> 01:09:40.500
- I wasn't kissing her.

01:09:40.500 --> 01:09:42.265
She kissed me.

01:09:42.265 --> 01:09:44.133
- That's not how she saw it.

01:09:44.133 --> 01:09:45.533
- Don't worry, mate.

01:09:45.533 --> 01:09:49.133
After you went down, Suzy
got right and belted.

01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:54.066
- You all right?

01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:03.300
[moans]

01:10:04.966 --> 01:10:07.266
- Touch me, touch
me, right here.

01:10:07.700 --> 01:10:09.333
[moans]

01:10:14.233 --> 01:10:16.166
- What? [moans]

01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:19.200
Where's Fred?

01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:20.633
- She ran off.

01:10:21.133 --> 01:10:22.433
- I can't believe it.

01:10:22.433 --> 01:10:24.366
I screwed it up again.

01:10:24.366 --> 01:10:25.566
You were right.

01:10:25.566 --> 01:10:27.100
I've been jumping
from girl to girl,

01:10:27.100 --> 01:10:28.933
and now it's come back to
bite me in the buttocks.

01:10:28.933 --> 01:10:30.900
- More like punch
you in the face.

01:10:30.900 --> 01:10:34.700
- Look, I'm really sorry for
what I said to you before.

01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:36.466
Anyway, you were more
right than I was.

01:10:36.466 --> 01:10:39.400
I've been in a bad mood
since I was dumped.

01:10:39.700 --> 01:10:42.266
- Maybe it's time
you sorted it out.

01:10:42.366 --> 01:10:44.133
She's in here for a reason.

01:10:45.033 --> 01:10:47.400
- What are you going to do?

01:10:48.266 --> 01:10:50.600
- I'm going to do
as God told me.

01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:52.000
- What?

01:10:52.900 --> 01:10:54.166
- Nothing.

01:10:54.533 --> 01:10:57.866
And Luke... mate.

01:10:58.233 --> 01:10:59.833
- No problem.

01:11:12.966 --> 01:11:14.133
[Ariel sighs]

01:11:32.033 --> 01:11:33.966
- [Ariel] Okay.

01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:36.566
You can stop now.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:40.400
- Luke.

01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:43.100
give that prick a punch
in the bollocks for me.

01:11:46.733 --> 01:11:48.033
- [Ariel] Good luck.

01:11:50.666 --> 01:11:52.766
And if you mess it up,

01:11:52.766 --> 01:11:55.300
I'll crush your testicles.

01:11:57.966 --> 01:11:59.233
[kisses]

01:12:00.333 --> 01:12:02.033
[laughs]

01:12:05.533 --> 01:12:07.300
- You know what, Luke?

01:12:07.633 --> 01:12:09.766
That was a different
side to you,

01:12:11.166 --> 01:12:13.600
your really gay side.

01:12:20.433 --> 01:12:22.466
- And number three for the lady,

01:12:22.466 --> 01:12:24.633
and there we go.

01:12:24.700 --> 01:12:26.266
- Ah, leave the bottles' worth.

01:12:26.266 --> 01:12:27.500
- I'll leave the
bottle when you fucking

01:12:27.500 --> 01:12:29.400
pay for it, Dostoevsky.

01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:31.133
- All right, sorry.

01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:33.400
- I think this is it.

01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:34.933
I think she's the one.

01:12:36.233 --> 01:12:38.266
- It's been quite a day.

01:12:38.266 --> 01:12:40.533
- It ain't over yet.

01:12:41.700 --> 01:12:43.900
- I suppose I should
just get on with it.

01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:47.600
- Hey, you going to ask
her to get back with you?

01:12:47.766 --> 01:12:49.166
[sighs]

01:12:57.033 --> 01:12:58.400
- Jen.

01:12:58.533 --> 01:13:00.700
- Oh, hi Luke.

01:13:01.166 --> 01:13:02.766
- How are things?

01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:05.433
- Fine, you?

01:13:06.466 --> 01:13:08.333
- Pretty good, really.

01:13:10.066 --> 01:13:11.866
- You're probably wondering
what I'm doing here.

01:13:11.866 --> 01:13:13.600
- No, no, it's cool.

01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:15.233
It's a free country, isn't it?

01:13:15.233 --> 01:13:17.433
- I got a missed
call from you, and...

01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:20.966
I wanted to see you, Luke.

01:13:21.066 --> 01:13:24.600
I miss you, and with Valentine's
Day and everything...

01:13:24.833 --> 01:13:27.600
- Why did you want to see me?

01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:29.733
- I thought I wanted
to see how you were?

01:13:31.100 --> 01:13:34.566
Fact was, I was kind of hoping
you'd be a complete ass.

01:13:35.533 --> 01:13:38.200
I've been thinking about us.

01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:41.133
- Wait, you wanted to
see me because you knew

01:13:41.133 --> 01:13:43.100
that I'd be here, and what?

01:13:43.100 --> 01:13:46.066
You thought I'd be some kind
of drunken bone and what?

01:13:46.066 --> 01:13:48.200
That I'd beg you
to take me back?

01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:52.633
- I just wanted to tell you,
I think I still love you.

01:13:53.300 --> 01:13:54.833
[laughs]

01:13:56.066 --> 01:13:57.433
- What's wrong with you, Luke?

01:13:57.433 --> 01:14:00.333
- Nothing. No, no, I'm fine.

01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:01.633
I am fine.

01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:03.300
For the first time,
since you dumped me,

01:14:03.300 --> 01:14:04.733
I can see that I'm fine.

01:14:04.733 --> 01:14:05.833
Don't get me wrong,

01:14:05.833 --> 01:14:07.333
I've been through hell,

01:14:07.333 --> 01:14:08.500
but here I am.

01:14:08.500 --> 01:14:09.466
Come out on the other side,

01:14:09.466 --> 01:14:11.066
I've still got my friends.

01:14:11.066 --> 01:14:14.066
And right now, things
are looking up.

01:14:17.300 --> 01:14:18.700
- Look me in the eye,

01:14:18.700 --> 01:14:20.933
and tell me you don't
love me anymore.

01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:27.433
- I can't do that, Jen.

01:14:27.833 --> 01:14:30.600
But I can't say that I
don't hate you, either.

01:14:30.600 --> 01:14:32.433
You know, you never really
get to know somebody

01:14:32.433 --> 01:14:33.866
until they dump you,

01:14:33.866 --> 01:14:34.900
and right now...

01:14:34.900 --> 01:14:36.733
Right now I can see you

01:14:36.733 --> 01:14:39.233
for who you really are.

01:14:39.533 --> 01:14:41.666
- Well, I see who you are, Luke.

01:14:41.666 --> 01:14:43.466
A failure.

01:14:43.466 --> 01:14:45.100
When we met, I
had hopes for you,

01:14:45.100 --> 01:14:47.800
but [grunts] you
were just a loser.

01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:49.266
a failure,

01:14:49.266 --> 01:14:51.966
a small, no, tiny dick,

01:14:51.966 --> 01:14:54.300
hairy-shouldered fucking loser,

01:14:54.300 --> 01:14:55.600
momma's boy.

01:14:56.800 --> 01:14:59.166
- Don't you ever call
me a momma's boy.

01:14:59.166 --> 01:15:00.533
- I tried, Luke.

01:15:00.533 --> 01:15:03.633
I tried to mold you
into a proper person,

01:15:03.633 --> 01:15:05.033
but no.

01:15:05.100 --> 01:15:07.266
You just wanted to hang
out with your stupid mates.

01:15:07.266 --> 01:15:09.133
In fact, I kind of
thought you and Brady

01:15:09.133 --> 01:15:10.433
might be gay, for a while.

01:15:10.433 --> 01:15:12.066
- Gay? Yeah, yeah?

01:15:12.066 --> 01:15:14.100
Well, I wish I was gay

01:15:14.100 --> 01:15:15.866
because then I'd
be off, wouldn't I?

01:15:15.866 --> 01:15:18.300
I'd be around the world
sucking men's penii

01:15:18.300 --> 01:15:21.233
instead of being here
listening to bloody you.

01:15:21.566 --> 01:15:22.666
[scoffs]

01:15:23.533 --> 01:15:25.100
- Fuck you, Jen.

01:15:27.566 --> 01:15:29.500
And fuck you, too.

01:15:29.500 --> 01:15:30.133
[thud]

01:15:30.133 --> 01:15:31.333
[grunts]

01:15:32.666 --> 01:15:33.966
[growls]

01:15:36.866 --> 01:15:40.033
You know, Jen, you
really are a bitch.

01:15:40.866 --> 01:15:42.266
[grunts]

01:15:43.466 --> 01:15:46.600
[guitar music]

01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:55.200
[telephone ringing]

01:16:08.700 --> 01:16:09.700
- Fuck off, Brady.

01:16:09.700 --> 01:16:10.766
I don't want to speak to you.

01:16:10.766 --> 01:16:11.566
- Where are you?

01:16:11.566 --> 01:16:12.800
I need to see you.

01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:13.900
- Why don't you fuck
off back to your tart?

01:16:13.900 --> 01:16:15.633
- Fred, it wasn't like that.

01:16:15.933 --> 01:16:16.933
- I saw you kiss her.

01:16:16.933 --> 01:16:18.900
- It's not like that.

01:16:18.900 --> 01:16:20.400
- We're done talking.
- [Brady] Wait.

01:16:20.866 --> 01:16:25.866
- Fred, you annoy me more than
anyone else I've ever known.

01:16:26.700 --> 01:16:29.300
You smell of fish all the time.

01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:31.833
You bite your nails and
spit it on the floor.

01:16:31.833 --> 01:16:33.433
You never wash the bath out,

01:16:33.433 --> 01:16:34.866
and you're always late.

01:16:34.866 --> 01:16:36.600
- How come you're never
late, Mr. Fucking Perfect?

01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:37.966
- You're quick to throw a punch,

01:16:37.966 --> 01:16:40.300
but you run away from
anything that really matters

01:16:40.300 --> 01:16:41.733
because you're scared.

01:16:41.733 --> 01:16:42.833
You are scared.

01:16:42.833 --> 01:16:43.600
- Of what?

01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:45.466
- Of being yourself,

01:16:45.466 --> 01:16:46.933
but I know you, Fred.

01:16:46.933 --> 01:16:49.033
I know when you're with the
lads and you order a beer,

01:16:49.033 --> 01:16:51.300
you'd really rather
have a Merlot.

01:16:51.300 --> 01:16:53.033
I know when you say
you're going for slushie,

01:16:53.033 --> 01:16:54.400
you're going to top
up your lipstick,

01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:56.000
and I know you love me.

01:16:56.500 --> 01:16:57.433
- Fuck you.

01:16:57.433 --> 01:16:58.766
- Oh, and by the way, the dress?

01:16:58.766 --> 01:16:59.766
It didn't work,

01:16:59.766 --> 01:17:01.266
but not because of the dress,

01:17:01.266 --> 01:17:03.100
because it's just not you.

01:17:03.100 --> 01:17:04.900
- You're such a twat.

01:17:04.900 --> 01:17:06.300
You say you know me,

01:17:06.300 --> 01:17:07.900
but I know you, too.

01:17:07.900 --> 01:17:09.333
I know that you're
in a dead-end job

01:17:09.333 --> 01:17:11.666
because you are shit
scared of failing.

01:17:11.666 --> 01:17:13.533
You go fucking your
way around town,

01:17:13.533 --> 01:17:15.833
chasing anything with
tits and a heartbeat

01:17:15.833 --> 01:17:18.033
and you expect me
to fall to my knees

01:17:18.033 --> 01:17:20.333
and bounce when
you give me a turn.

01:17:20.466 --> 01:17:23.033
It drives me insane that
we live in the same house,

01:17:23.033 --> 01:17:26.200
and you parade that herd
of sluts under my nose.

01:17:26.500 --> 01:17:28.333
You're a selfish bastard,

01:17:28.333 --> 01:17:30.166
and I cannot wait
to get on a boat

01:17:30.166 --> 01:17:31.466
and sail the fuck away.

01:17:31.466 --> 01:17:32.600
- You know what, Fred?

01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:33.366
- What?

01:17:33.366 --> 01:17:34.100
- You know what?

01:17:34.100 --> 01:17:34.766
- What?

01:17:34.766 --> 01:17:35.966
- You're right.

01:17:35.966 --> 01:17:37.700
We are done talking.

01:17:42.866 --> 01:17:45.700
[sweet piano music]

01:17:57.300 --> 01:18:01.066
- If you hurt me, I will use
your balls as shark bait.

01:18:10.533 --> 01:18:12.566
- Time, gentlemen, please.

01:18:12.566 --> 01:18:14.566

01:18:20.633 --> 01:18:23.333
- You know, Ariel.

01:18:23.533 --> 01:18:25.400
I never really thought that

01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:28.833
punching someone really,
actually, quite...

01:18:29.166 --> 01:18:30.733
hurt so much.

01:18:30.900 --> 01:18:32.766
- Well, you did very well.

01:18:32.766 --> 01:18:34.233
His fists looked very sore,

01:18:34.233 --> 01:18:36.166
so in a way, you won the fight.

01:18:39.066 --> 01:18:41.100
Oh, your breath stinks.

01:18:47.300 --> 01:18:49.033
- Where's Suzy?

01:18:49.033 --> 01:18:51.800
- We broke up.

01:18:53.166 --> 01:18:54.166
- What?

01:18:54.166 --> 01:18:55.466
She left me for another man.

01:18:56.866 --> 01:18:58.366
- She doesn't mess around.

01:18:58.366 --> 01:18:59.433
- No.

01:19:00.300 --> 01:19:01.333
- I thought she was the one.

01:19:01.333 --> 01:19:03.433
- Yeah, don't worry, mate.

01:19:04.166 --> 01:19:07.000
There is someone out
there for every one of us.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:08.066
Not me.

01:19:08.066 --> 01:19:09.000
- Come on, you lot.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:10.333
I've got a car park to get to.

01:19:10.333 --> 01:19:11.266
- Up we go.

01:19:11.266 --> 01:19:13.233
Come on, fine time.

01:19:18.933 --> 01:19:20.266
- Checkmate.

01:19:22.900 --> 01:19:25.466
- You won't know what's
hit you later, darling.

01:19:35.566 --> 01:19:36.933
- Coming back for a night cap?

01:19:36.933 --> 01:19:38.533
- Night cap? Come on.

01:19:38.533 --> 01:19:39.700
We can do whatever we want.

01:19:39.700 --> 01:19:40.866
We're free spirits.

01:19:40.866 --> 01:19:43.200
We can throw beer
mats at dogs, or

01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:45.300

01:19:45.633 --> 01:19:47.733

01:19:47.733 --> 01:19:49.433

01:19:49.433 --> 01:19:51.400
whichever one of those you want.

01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:53.866
I'm going to go home
and write my book.

01:19:53.866 --> 01:19:55.500
I'm feeling inspired.

01:19:57.300 --> 01:19:58.033

Life, it's a series of
endings and new beginnings,

01:20:19.233 --> 01:20:20.366
and every once in a while,

01:20:20.366 --> 01:20:22.866
one pops up when
you least expect it,

01:20:22.866 --> 01:20:25.333
which makes it all the
more exciting, I guess.

01:20:32.600 --> 01:20:33.766
As for my friends,

01:20:33.766 --> 01:20:34.800
they'll wake up tomorrow

01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:36.233
probably with a hangover.

01:20:36.233 --> 01:20:37.566

01:20:37.566 --> 01:20:39.233
things will be different.
