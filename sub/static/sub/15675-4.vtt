00:01.135 --> 00:01.635
( music playing )

00:27.661 --> 00:29.730
( beeps )

00:29.763 --> 00:31.232
Jesus.

00:32.733 --> 00:35.203
( chatter )

00:55.356 --> 00:58.292
( fizzing )

01:55.283 --> 01:56.917
Doug:
Your code loops
all over the place.

01:56.950 --> 01:59.587
It's not structured.
It's not maintainable
by anyone.

01:59.620 --> 02:01.889
- I disagree.
- There are reentrant forks,

02:01.922 --> 02:04.358
no way of knowing
which branch invoked
a function.

02:04.392 --> 02:07.661
We don't do that in C++.
It's officially deprecated
in the language.

02:07.695 --> 02:10.264
I can maintain it.
There are condition
flags for everything.

02:10.298 --> 02:11.499
There's no one-way arrow.

02:11.532 --> 02:12.900
Is that what
you want to do?

02:12.933 --> 02:14.635
Be the code grunt
for this sick piece
of choss?

02:14.668 --> 02:16.337
Dougie, chill.

02:16.370 --> 02:18.306
My guys will flowchart it.
I'll write out the flags...

02:18.339 --> 02:19.940
I'm sure you will.

02:19.973 --> 02:22.376
The flow chart
would strangle us.
It's a mess.

02:22.410 --> 02:23.611
And what do you mean
your guys?

02:23.644 --> 02:25.279
It's fast and it fits.

02:25.313 --> 02:26.614
It's no longer necessary.

02:26.647 --> 02:28.949
Doug, we bought
your company.

02:28.982 --> 02:31.552
You should adapt
to our programming language.

02:31.585 --> 02:33.287
I know it sucks
to be rewritten.

02:33.321 --> 02:34.922
It doesn't make sense.

02:34.955 --> 02:37.558
It's like asking a race car
to adapt to a covered wagon.

02:37.591 --> 02:39.560
- Poetic.
- Maybe we should
all try to,

02:39.593 --> 02:41.362
you know,
take our egos out of it.

02:41.395 --> 02:43.297
Well, my ego would love
to have a good night's sleep,

02:43.331 --> 02:46.334
but sadly it has
to rewrite your code first.

02:46.367 --> 02:47.801
( pencil clatters )

02:47.835 --> 02:48.936
Yikes.

02:48.969 --> 02:50.471
Diane, I am so sorry.

02:50.504 --> 02:51.805
Diane:
It's all fun and games

02:51.839 --> 02:53.241
till someone gets
stabbed in the cheek.

02:55.343 --> 02:56.410
Hi.

02:56.444 --> 02:57.911
I'm just here to observe.

02:59.447 --> 03:02.516
Okay, well...

03:02.550 --> 03:04.318
I think we're all
on the same page now.

03:04.352 --> 03:07.521
Definitely.
Um, we're really close.

03:07.555 --> 03:09.490
( scoffs )

03:09.523 --> 03:11.259
Maybe this'll help.

03:11.292 --> 03:12.860
It's an integration
road map.

03:12.893 --> 03:15.496
Look, we think the way you
created Mutiny was brilliant.

03:15.529 --> 03:17.731
The original block of code
was truly innovative.

03:17.765 --> 03:19.467
Mm-hmm, but?

03:19.500 --> 03:21.535
It doesn't play nice
with our SwapMeet code.

03:21.569 --> 03:23.871
If you make some changes
to that block

03:23.904 --> 03:25.906
and we make
some changes to our C++...

03:25.939 --> 03:28.642
It's a bug factory.
The old code makes
it impossible

03:28.676 --> 03:30.278
to keep track
of the reentrant looping.

03:32.380 --> 03:35.616
But I don't need
the object-oriented
language, okay?

03:35.649 --> 03:37.618
I can keep track
of the looping in my head.

03:37.651 --> 03:39.487
Oh, I get it.
You're that good.

03:39.520 --> 03:42.256
Yeah, I am.
Aren't you?

03:42.290 --> 03:43.791
Bosworth:
...looking all around
and then

03:43.824 --> 03:45.893
he came around the side
of the trailer there.

03:45.926 --> 03:47.761
And I swear to God,
he goes,

03:47.795 --> 03:49.530
"Man, that ain't no bear.
That's your ex-wife."

03:49.563 --> 03:51.365
- Grr!
- ( laughs )

03:51.399 --> 03:53.267
- She was just doing
the whole thing.
- Uh-oh.

03:53.301 --> 03:56.337
Oh, you surprised
to see her?

03:56.370 --> 03:57.571
- Yeah.
- Mm-mm.

03:57.605 --> 03:59.607
Adios, amiga.

03:59.640 --> 04:00.608
- Hey there.
- Hi.

04:00.641 --> 04:02.410
Hi.

04:02.443 --> 04:03.877
( stammers )
Here, go ahead.
After you.

04:03.911 --> 04:07.581
Thank you.
( chuckles )

04:07.615 --> 04:09.417
Good day, ladies.

04:09.450 --> 04:11.652
Donna:
Hi. Well, this is
a nice surprise.

04:11.685 --> 04:13.954
I was in the neighborhood.

04:13.987 --> 04:15.923
So, how's it going
with the SwapMeet guys?

04:15.956 --> 04:17.358
Um, good.

04:18.992 --> 04:20.694
You keep
telling me that
on the phone

04:20.728 --> 04:23.664
with that same
not-so-sure thing
you do with your voice.

04:23.697 --> 04:25.799
What not-so-sure thing?

04:25.833 --> 04:27.468
( chuckles )

04:27.501 --> 04:29.903
Anyway, I just popped
into their project meeting.

04:29.937 --> 04:32.540
The vibe
was pretty hostile.

04:32.573 --> 04:34.074
Why haven't you told me?

04:34.107 --> 04:36.310
Well, it's a work
in progress.

04:36.344 --> 04:38.679
- Donna.
- ( sighs ) I know.

04:38.712 --> 04:40.381
Cam isn't comfortable
with the guys yet,

04:40.414 --> 04:41.915
and I'm working on it.

04:41.949 --> 04:43.851
- How are you
working on it?
- Well--

04:43.884 --> 04:46.086
My point is,
we should be
working on it.

04:46.119 --> 04:48.622
If there are issues,
we need to air them out.

04:48.656 --> 04:49.957
Otherwise
resentment festers

04:49.990 --> 04:51.359
and the whole thing
starts to rot.

04:53.427 --> 04:54.695
All right,
how about this?

04:54.728 --> 04:56.797
We could all
go to dinner tonight,

04:56.830 --> 04:58.632
have some wine,
talk things through.

04:58.666 --> 05:00.434
- I do like wine.
- Great.

05:00.468 --> 05:01.802
But I can't do tonight.

05:01.835 --> 05:03.504
I've got tickets
to a charity thing,

05:03.537 --> 05:04.705
a fundraiser
for Save the Bay.

05:04.738 --> 05:06.674
- Oh, that sounds--
- Terrible.

05:06.707 --> 05:08.709
I was gonna say lovely.

05:08.742 --> 05:11.078
My date just cancelled
and I have a plus one.

05:11.111 --> 05:14.648
I could check with Gordon,
see if he could watch
the girls tonight.

05:14.682 --> 05:16.384
No, um...

05:16.417 --> 05:18.452
I was thinking
about John Bosworth.

05:18.486 --> 05:20.888
Oh.

05:20.921 --> 05:22.356
I mean...

05:22.390 --> 05:24.558
really?

05:24.592 --> 05:26.860
Bosworth:
"Man, that ain't no bear.
That's my ex-wife."

05:26.894 --> 05:28.962
- ( all laugh )
- Grr!

05:28.996 --> 05:33.000
You know, there'll be
a whole slew of Valley
big shots there.

05:33.033 --> 05:36.003
It's a great opportunity
for John to make some
business connections.

05:36.036 --> 05:37.871
Sure.

05:37.905 --> 05:40.007
But...

05:40.040 --> 05:42.410
nobody
calls him John.

05:44.645 --> 05:45.713
I do.

05:46.880 --> 05:49.617
"Never Get Older" playing

05:52.420 --> 05:54.655
All right, guys.

05:54.688 --> 05:56.056
Guys.

05:56.089 --> 05:58.492
- Guys, please, please!
- Shh!

05:58.526 --> 06:02.029
Bodie:
Yo, shut up, kid!

06:02.062 --> 06:03.764
All right,
I know we've gotten off
to a rough start,

06:03.797 --> 06:05.399
and I'm sorry about that.

06:05.433 --> 06:06.600
That's the understatement
of the century.

06:06.634 --> 06:07.868
We're in a bit
of a holding pattern

06:07.901 --> 06:10.137
ever since Cam took over
for our lead coder.

06:10.170 --> 06:12.005
- Louis: Yeah, that was genoid.
- Bodie: You don't know
jack about it.

06:12.039 --> 06:14.808
But we're gonna use this
as an opportunity.

06:14.842 --> 06:16.109
Now, I know we've
had some success

06:16.143 --> 06:18.145
flowcharting
the two systems.

06:18.178 --> 06:20.714
How are we doing
with our organizational
training objectives?

06:20.748 --> 06:22.916
Oh, you mean
the buddy system?

06:22.950 --> 06:25.819
It's a nightmare trying
to train these jokers.

06:25.853 --> 06:27.921
All they want to do
is bitch about C++.

06:27.955 --> 06:29.957
( robotic voice )
C++.

06:29.990 --> 06:32.560
He just follows me
around all day doing
this idiotic routine.

06:32.593 --> 06:34.662
- C++.
- Carl, he's
your trainee, okay?

06:34.695 --> 06:36.597
- I don't care.
- Master Carl,
I've been programmed

06:36.630 --> 06:38.532
- to observe
your every move...
- Okay.

06:38.566 --> 06:41.201
...so I may learn
from your flawed behavior
what it is to be human.

06:41.234 --> 06:42.970
Shut up,
shut up, shut up!

06:43.003 --> 06:44.204
Bodie:
He's not even funny.

06:44.237 --> 06:47.074
Bodie, stop
antagonizing him, okay?

06:47.107 --> 06:49.810
- Beep-boop-beep.
- Get out of my face!

06:49.843 --> 06:51.645
- Hey!
- Whoa, whoa!

06:51.679 --> 06:52.913
Let's kill
these a-holes!

06:52.946 --> 06:55.182
- Calm down!
- All: Oh!

06:55.215 --> 06:58.118
Oh, shit.
You okay?

07:00.988 --> 07:04.625
Everyone, sit down.

07:09.497 --> 07:10.564
What the f--?

07:10.598 --> 07:14.502
( theme music playing )

07:46.099 --> 07:49.570
You see?
It is just so charming.

07:49.603 --> 07:50.938
It has all
the original molding.

07:50.971 --> 07:53.140
And all
the original mold.

07:53.173 --> 07:57.210
And the backyard is adorable.
It's perfect for barbecues.

07:57.244 --> 07:58.946
Oh, did you hear that?

08:02.149 --> 08:05.686
Okay, why don't I give you
and your, uh, friend

08:05.719 --> 08:07.254
a minute to talk?

08:07.287 --> 08:08.989
Thanks.

08:10.858 --> 08:12.560
She thinks we're a couple.

08:12.593 --> 08:13.894
You're not my type.

08:13.927 --> 08:16.296
Yeah, this place
has character.

08:16.329 --> 08:17.831
This isn't a generic box.

08:17.865 --> 08:19.833
No, the Mutiny house
had character.

08:19.867 --> 08:23.003
This place
is just quaint.

08:23.036 --> 08:25.172
You've hated
every place we've seen.

08:25.205 --> 08:27.140
So? I'm picky.

08:27.174 --> 08:29.777
And nothing feels right.

08:29.810 --> 08:32.813
Is this about the house
or is this something else?

08:32.846 --> 08:37.317
It's Thing One
and Thing Two.

08:37.350 --> 08:39.687
God, I can't
stand them.

08:39.720 --> 08:43.557
Especially the bigger Thing,
this arrogant frat boy.

08:43.591 --> 08:44.858
( whines )

08:44.892 --> 08:46.293
The smaller Thing's
not so bad.

08:46.326 --> 08:47.895
You know their names.

08:47.928 --> 08:49.630
Yes, Tweedledee
and Tweedledum.

08:49.663 --> 08:51.231
Heckle and Jeckle.
Frick and Frack.

08:51.264 --> 08:53.801
I get it.
But they want
to be useful.

08:53.834 --> 08:56.169
By what? Translating
everything into C++?

08:56.203 --> 08:59.773
Donna, if I knew
that was the plan,
I wouldn't have signed on.

08:59.807 --> 09:02.075
But we did sign on.

09:02.109 --> 09:03.777
The guys are under
a two-year contract

09:03.811 --> 09:05.646
with a piece of the company.
We married them.

09:05.679 --> 09:08.582
We have to sit down
and talk it out

09:08.616 --> 09:12.319
before the whole thing
festers and rots.

09:12.352 --> 09:14.788
- We're having dinner
tomorrow night.
- What?

09:14.822 --> 09:16.590
That's a horrible idea.
Who suggested that?

09:17.925 --> 09:19.092
I did.

09:19.126 --> 09:20.961
Oh, great.

09:20.994 --> 09:23.130
And so now you're
just informing me.

09:23.163 --> 09:26.266
See?
It already
feels like home.

09:29.069 --> 09:32.039
MacMillan Utility
was always intended to be
a jumping-off point.

09:32.072 --> 09:34.842
Totally.
It's all about
transformation.

09:34.875 --> 09:36.376
Many companies
start doing one thing

09:36.409 --> 09:38.045
and then change direction.

09:38.078 --> 09:39.847
If we can just find
the right vector.

09:39.880 --> 09:43.183
Ryan:
Then our freeware
can stay free.

09:43.216 --> 09:44.885
Router tech is promising.

09:44.918 --> 09:46.987
Ah, Cisco's already
way ahead on that one.

09:47.020 --> 09:50.891
Uh, 3-D graphics.
Uh, AI.

09:50.924 --> 09:53.126
- 5th gen systems.
- It's a billion-dollar
road to nowhere.

09:53.160 --> 09:55.028
I give it a year.

09:55.062 --> 09:57.698
Fairchild made cameras.
Now they make semiconductors.

09:57.731 --> 10:00.233
Coleco was the Connecticut
Leather Company.

10:00.267 --> 10:01.769
Now they make video games.

10:01.802 --> 10:03.370
Yeah, and Mutiny started
as a games company.

10:03.403 --> 10:06.039
- Shut up.
- Sorry, I'm just
so stoked

10:06.073 --> 10:07.708
to be a part
of your process.

10:07.741 --> 10:10.744
- Plus the caffeine...
- No, I mean be quiet.

10:10.778 --> 10:12.045
Now.

10:12.079 --> 10:14.314
Please.

10:14.347 --> 10:18.351
Shh.

10:24.057 --> 10:25.125
Uh...

10:25.158 --> 10:26.760
okay.

10:26.794 --> 10:28.962
Let's circle
the five best ideas.

10:37.738 --> 10:39.172
Wait, what--
what are you doing, man?

10:39.206 --> 10:40.808
We spent weeks on that.

10:40.841 --> 10:42.175
There's some
good stuff there.

10:45.846 --> 10:47.948
Good is the enemy of great.

10:47.981 --> 10:50.884
If anything's worth pursuing,
we'll remember it tomorrow.

10:50.918 --> 10:51.952
( sighs )

10:51.985 --> 10:54.054
"Beyond Belief" playing

10:54.087 --> 10:56.356
* History repeats
the old conceits *

10:56.389 --> 10:59.760
* The glib replies,
the same defeats *

10:59.793 --> 11:01.795
* Keep your finger
on important issues *

11:01.829 --> 11:05.165
* With crocodile tears
and a pocketful of tissues *

11:05.198 --> 11:07.100
* I'm just the oily slick

11:07.134 --> 11:10.070
* On the windup world
of the nervous tick *

11:10.103 --> 11:15.475
* In a very
fashionable hovel *

11:15.508 --> 11:17.778
* I hang around,
dying to be tortured *

11:17.811 --> 11:20.413
* You'll never be alone
in the bone orchard *

11:20.447 --> 11:26.086
* This battle with the bottle
is nothing so novel *

11:26.119 --> 11:29.056
* So in this almost empty
gin palace... *

11:29.089 --> 11:30.858
( knock on door )

11:30.891 --> 11:32.960
* Through a two-way
looking glass... *

11:32.993 --> 11:34.161
Come in...

11:34.194 --> 11:36.129
if you must.

11:36.163 --> 11:37.731
Can we talk
for a minute?

11:37.765 --> 11:39.232
I guess.

11:43.136 --> 11:46.106
Look, I know we got off
on the wrong foot.

11:46.139 --> 11:49.176
I mean, we all want
the same thing, right?

11:52.179 --> 11:53.713
Yeah.

11:55.916 --> 11:57.350
Maybe we...

11:57.384 --> 11:59.152
got into this
too quickly,

11:59.186 --> 12:02.255
but, yeah, let's--
we're in it now, so...

12:02.289 --> 12:03.857
If you think
it was too quick,

12:03.891 --> 12:05.392
you have your man
Bos to thank.

12:05.425 --> 12:09.029
- He strong-armed us
into taking the deal.
- Really?

12:09.062 --> 12:11.364
- 'Cause I heard that you
and Greg misrepresented...
- It's Craig.

12:11.398 --> 12:13.266
...the value of your company
to lure us into overpaying.

12:13.300 --> 12:15.168
What's your deal?

12:15.202 --> 12:17.504
Why do you have
such a hard time
playing with others?

12:17.537 --> 12:20.273
Were you born this way
or did some loser ex-boyfriend

12:20.307 --> 12:22.275
turn you into
a man-hating bitch?

12:22.309 --> 12:23.977
( phone ringing )

12:24.011 --> 12:26.980
- Cameron: Ah!
- * I've got a feeling

12:27.014 --> 12:28.816
* I'm gonna get
a lot of grief... *

12:28.849 --> 12:31.318
- ( music stops )
- ( ringing continues )

12:31.351 --> 12:32.886
What?

12:32.920 --> 12:35.022
Man's voice:
Catherine? Is that you?

12:35.055 --> 12:37.825
- Yes.
- It's Len.

12:37.858 --> 12:39.292
What's wrong?

12:39.326 --> 12:41.528
Nothing, just--
sorry to call you at work.

12:41.561 --> 12:43.430
I wanted to let you know
your mom...

12:43.463 --> 12:44.998
What?

12:45.032 --> 12:47.167
Your mom and I
are selling the house.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.502
Bought a little condo
outside of Miami.

12:49.536 --> 12:51.905
We gotta get rid
of all that crap
in the garage.

12:51.939 --> 12:54.908
Do-- do you want
your dad's stuff?

12:54.942 --> 12:59.046
Your mom saved it for you,
but, you know, Miami.

12:59.079 --> 13:01.849
We're gonna sell
everything that's left
over 4th of July weekend.

13:01.882 --> 13:03.550
I was hoping you might
come and take a look,

13:03.583 --> 13:05.485
say hello to your mother.

13:05.518 --> 13:08.055
It's not like
it used to be.

13:08.088 --> 13:10.323
She's much better now.

13:10.357 --> 13:12.492
Oh, uh...

13:12.525 --> 13:16.229
then why didn't
she call?

13:16.263 --> 13:18.298
I hope you're doing well
out there.

13:18.331 --> 13:20.067
I'll let your mom know
that we talked.

13:20.100 --> 13:22.402
( line clicks,
dial tone )

13:26.573 --> 13:29.877
( indistinct arguing )

13:31.879 --> 13:33.480
Craig:
You need to apologize.

13:33.513 --> 13:35.182
All you have to do
is say, "I'm sorry,"
that's it.

13:35.215 --> 13:37.050
How many times
have I gotta try?

13:37.084 --> 13:39.286
- God.
- Wait, Doug!

13:45.158 --> 13:48.161
( door opens, closes )

13:54.968 --> 13:57.070
Hey, what was that about?

13:57.104 --> 13:59.106
Oh.

13:59.139 --> 14:02.910
Oh, just
the usual ups and downs
of a magical partnership.

14:04.244 --> 14:06.146
You're here late.

14:06.179 --> 14:10.150
But then you're probably
always here late.

14:10.183 --> 14:13.120
Are you implying
that I don't have a life?

14:13.153 --> 14:14.454
Yes.

14:19.192 --> 14:23.330
You could say
that Doug and I have
different styles.

14:23.363 --> 14:25.498
No shit.

14:25.532 --> 14:27.567
He just walked into my office
and called me a bitch.

14:27.600 --> 14:31.004
( sighs )

14:31.038 --> 14:33.240
I am so sorry.

14:33.273 --> 14:37.277
Look, we're really excited

14:37.310 --> 14:38.611
to be part of Mutiny.

14:38.645 --> 14:41.982
It's just SwapMeet
was our baby.

14:42.015 --> 14:45.385
I think Doug
still feels down
about having to sell.

14:45.418 --> 14:48.088
But that's no excuse.

14:53.660 --> 14:55.295
You want to see
something cool?

14:55.328 --> 14:57.364
Is it a dead body?

14:59.232 --> 15:01.368
Only if Doug's still here.

15:07.307 --> 15:09.609
You sure this is okay?

15:09.642 --> 15:11.644
He won't mind.

15:31.198 --> 15:32.432
Can I ask you something?

15:35.635 --> 15:37.604
Okay.

15:37.637 --> 15:40.540
Why won't you change
that original block of PL/M?

15:44.111 --> 15:47.514
It's the only piece left
that I wrote by myself.

15:49.749 --> 15:54.321
Alone in my bedroom,
just me.

15:54.354 --> 15:58.491
Back when this whole place
was just me.

15:58.525 --> 16:00.427
I did all the timings
by hand,

16:00.460 --> 16:02.595
I checked the status
on every buffer

16:02.629 --> 16:04.531
and every keystroke
every time,

16:04.564 --> 16:07.500
all with check loops.

16:07.534 --> 16:09.569
It was fast
and it was...

16:09.602 --> 16:12.105
Beautiful.

16:12.139 --> 16:15.442
It is beautiful.

16:22.549 --> 16:25.385
Yeah.

16:25.418 --> 16:26.653
And what do you
want me to say?

16:26.686 --> 16:30.423
I-- I'm proud
of this place.

16:30.457 --> 16:34.627
But back then,
it was this secret.

16:34.661 --> 16:37.497
It was all mine.

16:41.134 --> 16:42.669
Then we should
leave it alone.

16:58.818 --> 17:00.620
Ah.

17:06.593 --> 17:08.161
( sighs )

17:08.195 --> 17:09.729
Just got the weirdest
phone call.

17:11.331 --> 17:13.400
My stepfather.

17:13.433 --> 17:16.303
I guess he and my mom
are moving to Florida.

17:19.606 --> 17:22.375
They're selling
all my dad's stuff.

17:24.577 --> 17:26.846
He died when I was nine.

17:26.879 --> 17:29.716
Shit.

17:29.749 --> 17:33.453
I'm sorry to hear that.

17:33.486 --> 17:36.789
Just he had
this motorcycle...

17:39.192 --> 17:41.228
an old Panhead Harley.

17:41.261 --> 17:44.231
Oh, he used to ride me
to school on it.

17:46.133 --> 17:48.668
I'd show up to kindergarten
with this, like,

17:48.701 --> 17:50.437
gigantic helmet.

17:50.470 --> 17:54.307
I'm sure it looked
ridiculous, but it was--

17:56.409 --> 17:59.546
it just felt so...

18:02.882 --> 18:04.617
You should
go get the bike.

18:17.830 --> 18:20.533
Have you ever considered
a solo business venture?

18:20.567 --> 18:23.136
( soft laugh )

18:26.606 --> 18:29.209
- ( gunshots )
- ( quacking )

18:30.310 --> 18:31.844
( game chiming )

18:35.648 --> 18:37.517
Hmm.

18:37.550 --> 18:40.220
Wasn't the Nintendo system
supposed to be for Joanie?

18:40.253 --> 18:44.691
- ( gunshots )
- No, it was a family present.

18:44.724 --> 18:49.829
Anyways, I had to unwind
after that brawl today.

18:49.862 --> 18:52.399
I honestly don't know
what to do about those guys.

18:52.432 --> 18:53.866
Cardiff had its challenges,

18:53.900 --> 18:56.803
but no one ever
punched me in the ear.

18:56.836 --> 18:59.939
Yeah, well, you're not
at Cardiff anymore.

18:59.972 --> 19:02.609
( gunshots )

19:04.944 --> 19:06.613
There's your answer.

19:06.646 --> 19:08.781
Just take the guys
out back and shoot 'em.

19:08.815 --> 19:10.917
( quacking )

19:17.324 --> 19:19.459
( chimes )

19:23.563 --> 19:27.267
Bosworth:
Well, he comes around
the side of the trailer,

19:27.300 --> 19:28.268
and he goes,
"Man, that ain't a bear.

19:28.301 --> 19:29.269
That's your ex-wife."

19:29.302 --> 19:31.371
- Grr!
- ( laughing )

19:31.404 --> 19:34.307
See?
Thank you,
thank you.

19:34.341 --> 19:38.445
( coughs )
Man, it was crazy, man.

19:38.478 --> 19:40.413
And I don't know
how long she stayed there.

19:40.447 --> 19:41.981
She was there all night,

19:42.014 --> 19:43.583
just sort of
frozen in place.

19:43.616 --> 19:46.453
Grr!
The poor bastard...

19:46.486 --> 19:48.488
( woman giggles, screams )

19:48.521 --> 19:50.857
( continues indistinctly )

19:50.890 --> 19:53.793
- ( music playing )
- ( chattering )

19:59.699 --> 20:01.401
Don't move.

20:09.909 --> 20:12.512
Joe MacMillan.

20:12.545 --> 20:14.314
Of course.

20:14.347 --> 20:16.783
Diane Gould.

20:16.816 --> 20:19.552
Funny that we've
never officially met.

20:19.586 --> 20:21.754
But I'm certainly
aware of you.

20:21.788 --> 20:24.824
Amador Gould Gilson.
I admire your business model.

20:24.857 --> 20:28.361
Small, intelligent
investment portfolio.

20:28.395 --> 20:29.896
I guess you could
call that boutique.

20:29.929 --> 20:34.701
Well, size isn't
everything, right?

20:34.734 --> 20:38.037
I hear you facilitated
the SwapMeet acquisition
at Mutiny.

20:38.070 --> 20:39.406
Congrats.

20:39.439 --> 20:41.441
We're very excited
about it.

20:41.474 --> 20:43.343
I'm surprised Cameron Howe
wanted to play ball

20:43.376 --> 20:44.877
with another company.

20:44.911 --> 20:46.413
She must be
in a good place.

20:48.047 --> 20:50.350
Excuse me.
Can I, um--

20:50.383 --> 20:52.585
- can I borrow you
for a sec?
- Yeah.

20:52.619 --> 20:54.454
It's great
to finally meet you.

20:54.487 --> 20:55.788
Mm, you as well.

21:04.397 --> 21:07.600
( whooping, giggling )

21:07.634 --> 21:09.869
- ( music continues )
- ( chatter )

21:12.972 --> 21:14.507
How do I get
one of these?

21:14.541 --> 21:17.076
Uh, make more money.

21:17.109 --> 21:20.680
Which brings us
to our little problem.

21:20.713 --> 21:22.815
You heard
of this individual,
Topher Erickson?

21:22.849 --> 21:24.083
Does not ring a bell.

21:24.116 --> 21:25.685
His father's Cal Erickson,

21:25.718 --> 21:27.820
senior vice president
of General Atomics.

21:27.854 --> 21:29.722
Okay.

21:29.756 --> 21:33.693
Well, apparently
he was at one
of your parties

21:33.726 --> 21:36.028
and indulged in
a copious amount
of cocaine.

21:36.062 --> 21:37.964
Mm-hmm.

21:37.997 --> 21:39.899
And then grabbed
someone and went off
on a little joyride

21:39.932 --> 21:42.969
in the brand-new Ferrari
his father procured for
his 18th birthday.

21:43.002 --> 21:45.438
What kind of jerk
spends 60 grand
and buys Italian?

21:45.472 --> 21:47.874
Yeah, well,
this particular jerk

21:47.907 --> 21:49.909
funds about a quarter
of your business.

21:49.942 --> 21:51.578
Hmm, okay.

21:51.611 --> 21:54.046
And it's boring old
contractor clients like that

21:54.080 --> 21:56.783
that float your little
software experiments.

21:56.816 --> 21:58.451
I'm gonna mingle.

21:58.485 --> 22:00.353
Set something up.
I'll do damage control.

22:00.387 --> 22:02.555
Good.

22:02.589 --> 22:04.056
- Hi there.
- Mm.

22:05.758 --> 22:07.760
Friendly fella.

22:07.794 --> 22:10.597
Well, we can't all have
your Southern charm.

22:11.864 --> 22:13.566
I want to thank you
for calling me

22:13.600 --> 22:16.603
when my grandson
was born.

22:16.636 --> 22:17.804
That was you, right?

22:17.837 --> 22:19.071
Mm-hmm.

22:19.105 --> 22:23.910
Oh, sure.
Joe MacMillan,
man of mystery.

22:23.943 --> 22:27.580
Yeah, it's always
good to hear from
an old... friend.

22:27.614 --> 22:30.583
Well, you seem
to be doing just fine
making new friends.

22:30.617 --> 22:32.419
Oh, Miss Gould is just
a business associate.

22:32.452 --> 22:34.421
Oh, no, I mean
everyone here.

22:34.454 --> 22:36.122
They're lapping you up.

22:36.155 --> 22:37.857
It's a good call,
playing up the Texas thing.

22:37.890 --> 22:39.859
People love
a performance.

22:39.892 --> 22:41.894
It looks like you're
in a performance
of your own, huh?

22:41.928 --> 22:43.630
More of a one-man show
kind of thing.

22:43.663 --> 22:47.800
Yeah, I'm a regular
Spalding Gray.

22:50.637 --> 22:52.004
I left someone hanging.

22:52.038 --> 22:53.706
Be well.

22:59.846 --> 23:01.648
Oh, good,
you're still here.

23:01.681 --> 23:03.483
I was worried
you got kidnapped

23:03.516 --> 23:05.685
by that old pal
Joe MacMillan.

23:08.555 --> 23:10.857
- Can I top you off?
- Yes, please.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.002
You certainly
made a splash tonight.

23:23.035 --> 23:25.071
How so?

23:26.573 --> 23:28.675
You're the life
of the party.

23:28.708 --> 23:30.510
Everybody loves you.

23:32.545 --> 23:35.114
Between you and me,
I told Donna

23:35.147 --> 23:37.550
I was inviting you
for business.

23:37.584 --> 23:39.586
But really, I just didn't
feel like flying solo,

23:39.619 --> 23:42.221
you know,
under the circumstances?

23:42.254 --> 23:44.891
Glad I could be
of service.

23:44.924 --> 23:46.659
Isn't that crazy?

23:46.693 --> 23:49.629
That you can build a life
with someone, raise kids,

23:49.662 --> 23:53.700
spend your 20s, your 30s,
half your damn 40s together,

23:53.733 --> 23:56.569
and in the end
feel nothing?

23:57.870 --> 23:59.539
How is that possible?

23:59.572 --> 24:01.541
I don't know.

24:01.574 --> 24:03.576
Would you like
a cigarette?

24:03.610 --> 24:05.845
No.

24:05.878 --> 24:08.581
No, I'm good.

24:08.615 --> 24:11.984
Somewhere along the line,
I lost my taste for tobacco.

24:12.018 --> 24:14.053
And champagne.

24:14.086 --> 24:15.722
Parties.

24:28.635 --> 24:31.037
I told my lawyer
I didn't want
to fly up here

24:31.070 --> 24:32.271
and bail Topher out
right away.

24:32.304 --> 24:33.673
Let him cool
his heels for a while,

24:33.706 --> 24:35.908
reflect upon
his actions.

24:35.942 --> 24:38.144
Plus, SF's not
my cup of tea.

24:38.177 --> 24:40.012
It must be hard
to leave La Jolla.

24:40.046 --> 24:42.114
I love Del Mar.
It's got the perfect mix

24:42.148 --> 24:45.217
of sand bottom beach breaks
and patchy reefs.

24:45.251 --> 24:48.921
It's, uh--
it's very easy
to find a wave

24:48.955 --> 24:50.222
you can call your own.

24:50.256 --> 24:51.924
I've always envied surfers.

24:51.958 --> 24:54.694
We do a little naval work
out at Coronado Island.

24:54.727 --> 24:56.563
- Mm.
- Those bastards offshore

24:56.596 --> 24:58.531
look like they don't have
a care in the world

24:58.565 --> 25:00.967
while I'm stuck to my seat
worrying about packet switching

25:01.000 --> 25:02.835
and computer viruses,
thank you very much.

25:02.869 --> 25:05.204
- ( chuckles )
- Packet switching?

25:05.237 --> 25:07.607
- Is that with the DoD?
- Yeah, nothing sexy.

25:07.640 --> 25:09.141
Just moving a bunch
of electronic boxes around.

25:09.175 --> 25:10.810
- Mm.
- System's so damn clunky,

25:10.843 --> 25:12.579
they're gonna overhaul
the whole thing.

25:12.612 --> 25:13.980
Ken:
Ugh, sounds like
a pain in the ass.

25:14.013 --> 25:15.682
You know
what you should do?

25:15.715 --> 25:18.651
You should take a page
from those carefree bastards

25:18.685 --> 25:21.253
and you should
catch a wave, huh?
Clear your mind.

25:21.287 --> 25:23.723
Joe's got
a great instructor
down your way.

25:25.157 --> 25:27.226
She's, uh--
she's amazing.

25:27.259 --> 25:28.695
And guess what,
her name--

25:28.728 --> 25:30.329
it's, uh--
her name is Sandy.

25:30.362 --> 25:31.931
- ( both laugh )
- Sandy.

25:31.964 --> 25:34.033
- Right, Joe.
- ( chuckles )

25:34.066 --> 25:36.535
That's good.
Love to meet her.

25:39.371 --> 25:42.575
Look, I know
I'm being managed here.

25:42.609 --> 25:44.143
Glenfiddich goes down nice,
but it doesn't wipe away

25:44.176 --> 25:46.178
the taste
of that phone call
from those cops.

25:46.212 --> 25:49.749
Topher's still a teenager.
We don't let our boy run wild.

25:49.782 --> 25:51.951
Cal, I was very troubled

25:51.984 --> 25:53.285
when I heard
what happened to your son.

25:53.319 --> 25:56.856
I had no idea there were
minors in my home

25:56.889 --> 25:58.224
or narcotics,

25:58.257 --> 26:00.993
and in no universe
would I approve of that.

26:03.863 --> 26:05.598
All right.

26:05.632 --> 26:07.867
You seem
like a decent man.

26:07.900 --> 26:09.836
Not some 'Frisco nutjob.

26:09.869 --> 26:13.305
I'll submit a detailed report
to the big boss, i.e., my wife,

26:13.339 --> 26:16.108
and, uh, that should
clear things up.

26:16.142 --> 26:18.344
Might not mention
Sandy to her, though.

26:20.112 --> 26:22.148
Nothing like a girl
in a wet suit,
am I right?

26:22.181 --> 26:24.150
You sure are.
Although, I prefer a bikini.

26:24.183 --> 26:26.252
Yeah.

26:26.285 --> 26:30.723
Some of our business
associates in SF,

26:30.757 --> 26:33.693
they're a little funny,
if you catch my drift.

26:33.726 --> 26:35.662
Soft handshakes.

26:35.695 --> 26:37.730
Hell, maybe
we'll get lucky

26:37.764 --> 26:40.800
and all the faggots
will catch that special flu
that's going around.

26:40.833 --> 26:42.334
As long as my son
stays away from it.

26:42.368 --> 26:44.837
But, uh, got plenty of time
to whip him into shape.

26:44.871 --> 26:46.138
Like I said,
he's still a kid.

26:46.172 --> 26:49.742
All right, gentlemen,
it's that time.

26:49.776 --> 26:52.945
All right.
Yes, sir.

26:52.979 --> 26:54.781
Hey, watch it, man.

26:54.814 --> 26:56.315
Do you know,
I wouldn't worry
about your son.

26:56.348 --> 26:59.218
He'll find his path
when he gets away from you.

26:59.251 --> 27:01.353
But I feel sorry
for your wife.

27:01.387 --> 27:03.155
She has to lie there
taking it,

27:03.189 --> 27:05.024
wondering
what the hell she did

27:05.057 --> 27:07.226
to have your stinking
breath in her face.

27:07.259 --> 27:11.197
Or, wait,
maybe I was wrong.

27:11.230 --> 27:13.365
Maybe the big boss
isn't the one taking it.

27:15.034 --> 27:16.869
Hey, Jesus Christ, Joe.

27:16.903 --> 27:18.237
We had the son of a bitch
locked and you had to--

27:18.270 --> 27:19.739
Had to what?

27:19.772 --> 27:22.108
We sell security software
to the government.

27:23.275 --> 27:26.245
Hey, wait.
Come on, hey!

27:35.287 --> 27:36.989
Hey.

27:37.023 --> 27:38.324
Hey.

27:38.357 --> 27:40.192
It was great hanging out
with you last night.

27:43.162 --> 27:44.263
Mm-hmm.

27:44.296 --> 27:46.833
( keyboard clacking )

27:50.169 --> 27:52.171
- Can I just--
- Uh, yeah.

28:07.286 --> 28:09.455
Sure.

28:09.488 --> 28:11.791
Cool.

28:11.824 --> 28:14.126
I'll let you
get back to work.

28:19.398 --> 28:21.300
( groans )

28:26.505 --> 28:28.975
I heard you two had
a good conversation
last night.

28:29.008 --> 28:31.243
Uh, yeah.

28:31.277 --> 28:34.246
I decided to, uh, keep
the SwapMeet code as it is

28:34.280 --> 28:37.216
and translate
some of Mutiny into C++
to bridge the interface.

28:37.249 --> 28:38.384
Really?
That's great.

28:38.417 --> 28:39.919
The guys are
gonna be thrilled.

28:39.952 --> 28:43.722
And I think
we should fire them.

28:44.991 --> 28:47.927
What? Why?

28:47.960 --> 28:51.063
Do you have an actual,
you know, reason we
can give Diane,

28:51.097 --> 28:52.865
since she's the one
who's gonna have
to pay for it?

28:52.899 --> 28:55.134
Yes.

28:55.167 --> 28:56.335
We don't need them.

28:58.337 --> 28:59.806
Well, the dinner
is tonight.

28:59.839 --> 29:01.007
If you really want
to fire the guys,

29:01.040 --> 29:02.741
then you can
tell Diane yourself.

29:05.177 --> 29:07.046
"You Make Me Wanna Dance"
playing in background

29:07.079 --> 29:10.449
Oh, no!
They have three-player
"Yeti Mountain Mission"?

29:10.482 --> 29:11.918
Race!

29:11.951 --> 29:13.786
No, no, no, no, no.
No video games.

29:13.820 --> 29:15.154
We're here to coalesce
as a group.

29:15.187 --> 29:16.789
- What?
- So line up by "heighth."

29:16.823 --> 29:18.357
- What?
- "Heighth"?

29:18.390 --> 29:21.060
Height.
Line up by height.
How tall you are.

29:21.093 --> 29:23.195
- ( laughing )
- Height.

29:23.229 --> 29:24.430
So you're gonna
be at the end.

29:24.463 --> 29:26.498
You're at this end
over here.

29:26.532 --> 29:28.334
- Hey, does hair count?
- Yes, hair counts.

29:28.367 --> 29:30.169
Down here at the end.

29:30.202 --> 29:32.371
Arki, you're in the center.
Lev, you're there.

29:32.404 --> 29:34.040
Wonderboy,
down at the end.

29:34.073 --> 29:35.174
Come on, guys.

29:35.207 --> 29:37.109
Bodie:
Yeah, Wonderboy.

29:37.143 --> 29:39.946
All right, you've been
ordered by Allied Command

29:39.979 --> 29:41.914
to select
12 general prisoners...

29:41.948 --> 29:44.516
- I'm innocent.
- ...convicted by
courts-martial

29:44.550 --> 29:48.855
and sentenced to be executed
or serve lengthy prison terms

29:48.888 --> 29:52.058
for murder, robbery,

29:52.091 --> 29:54.894
striking
a general in the ear,

29:54.927 --> 29:56.896
and other crimes
of violence.

29:56.929 --> 29:59.198
And you will deliver them
behind enemy lines

29:59.231 --> 30:03.002
in France to undertake
a mission of sabotage

30:03.035 --> 30:05.404
that could change
the course of the war.

30:05.437 --> 30:08.074
Okay, Lee Marvin,
but don't most of the guys
in that movie eat it?

30:08.107 --> 30:09.575
By the end, is it more
like the "Dirty Deuce"?

30:09.608 --> 30:11.477
I'll show you
a Dirty Deuce, Bodie.

30:11.510 --> 30:13.913
It's a metaphor.

30:13.946 --> 30:15.414
Actually, it's more
of an allegory.

30:15.447 --> 30:16.615
Uh, pipe down,
Smurfette.

30:16.648 --> 30:18.117
An allegory
is a metaphor.

30:18.150 --> 30:19.251
F you, semen.

30:19.285 --> 30:21.520
Semen?
Did she just
call me semen?

30:21.553 --> 30:23.255
- Man on P.A.: It's time
for the next battle!
- ( feedback squeals )

30:23.289 --> 30:25.324
God.

30:25.357 --> 30:30.362
Players, follow me
for instruction in the rules
of honorable play.

30:30.396 --> 30:32.498
Bodie:
You need to turn
down your toys.

30:32.531 --> 30:34.934
Come on, guys.
Let's see a little bit
of that Apache know-how.

30:34.967 --> 30:36.035
( growls )

30:36.068 --> 30:38.437
( guns blasting )

30:38.470 --> 30:40.539
- Cover me, cover me!
- ( coders shouting )

30:40.572 --> 30:42.608
There he is,
there he is!

30:42.641 --> 30:44.510
- Buckle up, big man.
- Shit!

30:46.312 --> 30:50.349
( shouting indistinctly )

30:50.382 --> 30:54.120
Guys, don't
just stand around.
Fight back!

30:54.153 --> 30:56.923
I'm out, I'm done.
Screw you, asshole.

30:56.956 --> 30:59.658
All right, guys,
green team, gather around,
gather around.

30:59.691 --> 31:01.560
All right,
look, focus, okay?

31:01.593 --> 31:03.930
Guard the base.
Get each other's backs,
all right?

31:03.963 --> 31:05.998
Is this thing even on?

31:06.032 --> 31:08.000
Bodie, get down.
You're in the line of fire!

31:08.034 --> 31:09.535
Wonderboy, get that
out of your mouth.

31:09.568 --> 31:11.270
Come on, man,
get your head in the game.

31:11.303 --> 31:13.605
( blasting )

31:13.639 --> 31:16.208
Hey, guys, check it out.
If you just cover this thing,
you can't get hit.

31:16.242 --> 31:18.377
There must be
a way to disengage
the entire system.

31:18.410 --> 31:19.645
What a bunch of pussies.

31:19.678 --> 31:20.679
That's sexist.

31:20.712 --> 31:22.281
- ( beeps )
- All: Oh!

31:22.314 --> 31:24.416
- He's on our team!
- F off, you big D.

31:24.450 --> 31:26.285
- ( beeps )
- Oh, my God, stop!

31:26.318 --> 31:28.387
We're all gonna die!

31:28.420 --> 31:30.156
It's Judgment Day,
sinners!

31:30.189 --> 31:32.358
- ( shouting )
- Coder: Dodged a shot.

31:32.391 --> 31:34.093
"Goodnight, Saigon"
playing

31:34.126 --> 31:37.596
( all screaming )

31:37.629 --> 31:39.431
Let's do this!

31:39.465 --> 31:46.538
* We said we'd all
go down together *

31:46.572 --> 31:53.612
* Yes, we would all
go down together *

31:53.645 --> 32:00.652
* We said we'd all
go down together *

32:00.686 --> 32:03.522
* Yes, we would
all go down... *

32:03.555 --> 32:05.491
( all yelling )

32:05.524 --> 32:08.494
( all cheering )

32:08.527 --> 32:11.663
Yeah!

32:11.697 --> 32:14.133
( cheering continues )

32:17.636 --> 32:20.639
Sir! Sir!
You are officially
disqualified.

32:20.672 --> 32:22.074
Coders: What?!

32:22.108 --> 32:24.410
( all chanting )
Green! Green! Green!

32:26.712 --> 32:30.182
( echoes )
* And who was right?

32:33.719 --> 32:36.322
( chatter )

32:36.355 --> 32:37.756
Craig:
We feel 100% confident.

32:37.789 --> 32:39.458
Doug:
If we're properly assigned,

32:39.491 --> 32:41.493
we can get this whole thing
out the door in three weeks.

32:41.527 --> 32:43.229
Three weeks?

32:43.262 --> 32:46.098
That's much sooner
than we expected, right?

32:46.132 --> 32:47.766
Oh, I just wish--

32:47.799 --> 32:50.602
Let it go.
She's not coming.

32:50.636 --> 32:52.071
( sighs )

32:52.104 --> 32:54.240
I thought you two
had a good conversation.

32:54.273 --> 32:56.208
Yeah, I thought so, too.

32:56.242 --> 32:57.543
We have so much
respect for Cam

32:57.576 --> 32:59.545
and what you guys
have built together.

32:59.578 --> 33:02.481
It sounds nice and all,
but the real question is
can you work with her?

33:02.514 --> 33:04.083
- Definitely.
- Of course.

33:04.116 --> 33:06.718
We just get the feeling
she can't work with us.

33:06.752 --> 33:08.720
You know?

33:08.754 --> 33:11.257
Are we ready
to go ahead and order?

33:11.290 --> 33:12.358
"Cold Siren"
playing in background

33:12.391 --> 33:14.193
* Cold, cold creature

33:14.226 --> 33:17.529
* And she keeps
her so-called heart *

33:17.563 --> 33:23.769
* She's a cold, cold,
cold, cold, siren song *

33:23.802 --> 33:26.205
* A cold,
siren song... *

33:41.587 --> 33:43.489
( chatter )

33:47.459 --> 33:49.061
I'm sorry.

33:49.095 --> 33:50.562
It's not your fault.

33:50.596 --> 33:52.664
Can we have
the check, please?

33:52.698 --> 33:55.767
I just think
if Cam doesn't want
to work with the guys,

33:55.801 --> 33:58.170
she should have
the courage to deal
with it face-to-face.

33:58.204 --> 33:59.771
No, I know.

33:59.805 --> 34:01.307
Look, I wanted her
to tell you,

34:01.340 --> 34:04.710
but since
she's not here...

34:04.743 --> 34:07.646
Cam wants to fire
Doug and Craig.

34:09.215 --> 34:10.582
Really?
That's big.

34:10.616 --> 34:12.151
Yeah.

34:12.184 --> 34:14.686
Do you agree with her?

34:14.720 --> 34:17.323
Well, I--
she's my partner.

34:17.356 --> 34:21.127
Personally, I think
these guys are a big asset.

34:21.160 --> 34:22.694
But your relationship
with Cameron

34:22.728 --> 34:24.130
is the most
important thing.

34:24.163 --> 34:27.566
That's what
I'm investing in.

34:27.599 --> 34:30.636
If working with
Doug and Craig is untenable,

34:30.669 --> 34:33.872
Mutiny can pay
their earn-out early
and send 'em home.

34:33.905 --> 34:36.675
But you just said
that they're a big asset.

34:36.708 --> 34:38.710
I wouldn't
be happy about it,

34:38.744 --> 34:41.813
but it's better than
forcing something toxic.

34:41.847 --> 34:44.250
I just hope it's the guys
who are the problem.

34:47.519 --> 34:49.321
So, how's
the team-building coming?

34:49.355 --> 34:51.457
Well, surprisingly
productive.

34:51.490 --> 34:54.193
Although I've been banned
from future competition

34:54.226 --> 34:56.762
due to my controversial
military tactics.

34:56.795 --> 34:58.864
- ( chuckles )
- You can get out there.
They're still there.

34:58.897 --> 35:00.299
It's stupid fun.

35:00.332 --> 35:04.236
No, I just
came by 'cause I--

35:04.270 --> 35:06.438
well, 'cause
I said I would.

35:06.472 --> 35:09.441
Well, look at you,
Mr. Nice Guy.

35:09.475 --> 35:11.777
Mr. Nice Guy?

35:11.810 --> 35:15.714
Back at Cardiff,
you were the heavy
SVP of Sales.

35:15.747 --> 35:17.483
All those
multimillion-dollar
accounts,

35:17.516 --> 35:19.518
everybody was
scared shitless of you.

35:19.551 --> 35:21.620
You know,
including myself.

35:21.653 --> 35:22.854
But now...

35:22.888 --> 35:25.791
Now what?

35:25.824 --> 35:29.561
Look, I just mean, you know,
being the boss sounds good,

35:29.595 --> 35:31.397
but this is better.

35:31.430 --> 35:33.765
There's minimal
responsibility,
maximum fun.

35:33.799 --> 35:38.404
Which reminds me,
what's that story
you keep telling the guys?

35:38.437 --> 35:40.806
- Something about...
- That thing's outta gas.

35:40.839 --> 35:44.610
( coders laughing )
Bos!

35:44.643 --> 35:46.645
- You should've seen it.
- Oh, man, you're not
gonna believe it.

35:46.678 --> 35:48.647
Gordon went
full-on kamikaze.

35:48.680 --> 35:50.816
He practically
murdered the guy.

35:50.849 --> 35:53.285
It seemed totally
lame at first, but it was
actually pretty awesome.

35:53.319 --> 35:54.920
Yeah, even she
liked it.

35:54.953 --> 35:56.422
( all laugh )

35:56.455 --> 35:57.723
You should play
the next round, man.

35:57.756 --> 35:58.824
- You would shred
this course.
- No.

35:58.857 --> 36:00.826
Coders:
Come on. Come on.

36:00.859 --> 36:04.363
( chanting )
Bos! Bos! Bos!

36:07.566 --> 36:09.768
No, I'm good.

36:09.801 --> 36:10.902
I said I'm good!

36:18.310 --> 36:19.978
Go have another round.

36:20.011 --> 36:22.314
Get on in there.
You guys enjoy it.

36:22.348 --> 36:24.816
- Okay, yeah.
- ( overlapping chatter )

36:24.850 --> 36:26.585
( all cheering )

36:26.618 --> 36:28.520
( guns blasting )

36:43.369 --> 36:45.271
( sighs )

36:55.314 --> 36:56.382
Cam.

36:58.717 --> 37:00.018
What time is it?

37:00.051 --> 37:02.854
It's late.
You missed the dinner.

37:02.888 --> 37:05.491
Oh, my God, Donna,
I'm sorry.

37:05.524 --> 37:08.960
Jesus, I--
I don't know...

37:08.994 --> 37:10.996
I meant to be there.
I planned to be there.

37:11.029 --> 37:12.631
I don't know
what happened.

37:12.664 --> 37:14.266
You're overworked,
that's what happened.

37:14.300 --> 37:16.402
You're exhausted.

37:16.435 --> 37:18.470
Um, how was the dinner?

37:18.504 --> 37:21.373
Fine.

37:21.407 --> 37:22.641
Doug sucked up a lot.

37:22.674 --> 37:24.543
God, I hate that guy.

37:24.576 --> 37:26.445
I know.
But Craig's okay.

37:26.478 --> 37:27.946
Yeah.

37:29.315 --> 37:31.450
After they left,

37:31.483 --> 37:33.018
I told Diane
you want to fire them.

37:33.051 --> 37:34.953
And?

37:37.889 --> 37:39.458
She said no.

37:42.060 --> 37:43.729
What do you mean,
she said no?

37:43.762 --> 37:45.964
They're a part of the deal.

37:45.997 --> 37:49.901
They're an important asset
and we have to find a way
to make it work.

37:49.935 --> 37:51.337
( chuckles )
What?

37:51.370 --> 37:53.339
I thought she
was on our side.

37:53.372 --> 37:56.608
She feels
it's what's best
for the company.

38:03.549 --> 38:05.384
Okay.

38:05.417 --> 38:08.587
( exhales )

38:08.620 --> 38:11.823
Okay, well,
thank you for asking.
I really appreciate it.

38:13.124 --> 38:14.593
Yeah.

38:16.695 --> 38:19.365
- I'll see you at home.
- Yeah.

38:35.881 --> 38:39.084
( door opens, closes )

38:53.399 --> 38:55.734
( door opens )

38:55.767 --> 38:57.869
Hello?

38:57.903 --> 39:02.140
I'm cool to work at night,
but your call kind of
freaked me out.

39:02.173 --> 39:05.143
We lost
General Atomics today.

39:05.176 --> 39:09.047
They represent 37%
of our annual billing.

39:09.080 --> 39:11.016
What happened?

39:11.049 --> 39:13.552
I traded them
for something
more valuable.

39:15.721 --> 39:17.155
What's this?

39:17.188 --> 39:19.625
The log-in credentials
for the ARPANET,

39:19.658 --> 39:22.027
the Department of Defense
packet-switching network.

39:22.060 --> 39:24.763
I secured the information
through General Atomics.

39:24.796 --> 39:26.765
I want you to look into it
before they flag

39:26.798 --> 39:28.600
that my credentials
still work.

39:28.634 --> 39:32.037
Okay, but, you know,
the ARPANET isn't new tech.

39:32.070 --> 39:36.442
It's sort of rusty.
It's not like missile codes
or fighter plane blueprints.

39:36.475 --> 39:38.143
This is--
this is mundane stuff.

39:38.176 --> 39:41.179
I do know that.
It's antiquated.

39:41.212 --> 39:43.381
And that means
it's ripe for an upgrade.

39:44.683 --> 39:46.184
So what should I do?

39:46.217 --> 39:50.656
I need you to go
into it, map it,

39:50.689 --> 39:54.926
and help me figure out
what's next.

39:54.960 --> 39:58.129
- ( duck quacking )
- ( gunshots )

39:59.965 --> 40:01.833
- Cameron: Why?
- ( game chimes )

40:01.867 --> 40:04.436
( Cameron and Gordon
chatting indistinctly )

40:14.546 --> 40:16.648
- Play after this.
- There's two controllers,
though.

40:16.682 --> 40:20.085
Play after I finish
the best out of 10.

40:20.118 --> 40:23.855
Man, you're like some kind
of "Duck Hunt" savant.

40:23.889 --> 40:26.224
Does that mean I'm totally
deficient in other areas?

40:26.257 --> 40:31.229
Like "Duck Hunt" savant,
but bad team player.

40:31.262 --> 40:32.964
Come on.
( groans )

40:32.998 --> 40:34.466
So how's it going with...

40:34.500 --> 40:36.535
( German accent )
...Dick und Doof?

40:36.568 --> 40:38.537
Dick und Doof?

40:38.570 --> 40:40.806
That's what my grandfather
called Laurel and Hardy.

40:40.839 --> 40:42.708
Loosely translates
to "chubby and dumb."

40:42.741 --> 40:46.878
Well, that's perfect,
'cause Doug's the Dick...

40:46.912 --> 40:48.680
Und Craig ist Doof.

40:48.714 --> 40:50.115
- Ja.
- Ja.

40:50.148 --> 40:51.850
( both laugh )

40:51.883 --> 40:54.019
Ahh!

40:55.186 --> 40:56.788
Oh, whatever, though.

40:56.822 --> 40:59.190
I guess I'm gonna
have to make it work.

41:00.959 --> 41:02.628
All right, hope you
haven't lost your edge

41:02.661 --> 41:04.730
now that you're
a peacemaker.

41:08.299 --> 41:10.769
Uh, oh, do you
want a soda?

41:10.802 --> 41:12.938
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah?

41:23.281 --> 41:24.883
- Hey.
- Jesus!

41:24.916 --> 41:26.718
What are you doing?

41:26.752 --> 41:30.155
You know, I wanted
to tell you something.

41:30.188 --> 41:34.092
I've been thinking,
and you should stay here
as long as you want.

41:34.125 --> 41:37.696
You can take your time
finding a place.

41:45.737 --> 41:48.239
( "Duck Hunt" continues
in background )

42:00.251 --> 42:04.155
Oh, thanks.
Yes!

42:04.189 --> 42:05.991
All right,
all you.

42:08.827 --> 42:10.829
Can I ask you a question?

42:13.131 --> 42:15.266
When did you know
you were losing Cardiff?

42:25.243 --> 42:27.713
( music playing )
