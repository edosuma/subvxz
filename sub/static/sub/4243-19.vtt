00:00.521 --> 00:03.128
So here's what you missed
<i>on</i> Glee: <i>A gun went off</i>

00:03.137 --> 00:04.781
<i>at school and everyone</i>
<i>was terrified,</i>

00:04.789 --> 00:07.034
<i>and Sue said it was hers</i>
<i>and had to leave McKinley,</i>

00:07.052 --> 00:11.379
I'm ready to take my punishment. <i>But
secretly she's just protecting Becky.</i>

00:11.381 --> 00:13.097
Emma, stop. Stop.
<i>Finn kissed Emma</i>

00:13.099 --> 00:15.066
<i>and then apologized to Will,</i>
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

00:15.068 --> 00:17.394
<i>But Will never really forgave</i>
<i>him so Finn went off to college</i>

00:17.403 --> 00:19.370
<i>to fulfill his dream</i>
<i>of becoming a teacher.</i>

00:19.372 --> 00:21.405
Broadwayworld.com is saying
<i>Funny Girl</i> is finally

00:21.407 --> 00:23.374
happening this season.
<i>And Rachel got an audition</i>

00:23.376 --> 00:26.044
<i>to play Fanny Brice in a</i>
<i>Broadway revival of</i> Funny Girl,

00:26.046 --> 00:27.578
<i>to fulfill her dream of playing</i>
<i>Fanny Brice</i>

00:27.580 --> 00:29.364

00:29.366 --> 00:31.633
<i>And that's what you missed</i>
<i>on</i> Glee.

00:32.213 --> 00:34.380
FINN: <i>The truth is, I decided to
go to the Army after high school</i>

00:34.431 --> 00:37.466
<i>because I was kind of</i>
<i>afraid of college.</i>

00:37.500 --> 00:39.601
<i>Smart people go to college,</i>
<i>like doctors.</i>

00:39.636 --> 00:42.888
<i>The whole thing just seemed</i>
<i>scarier than getting shot.</i>

00:42.939 --> 00:44.807
<i>But now that I'm here</i>

00:44.841 --> 00:46.692
<i>I wish I would've come sooner.</i>

00:46.726 --> 00:49.395

RACHEL: <i>Some dreams are bigger</i>

02:15.932 --> 02:18.150
<i>Me being on Broadway,</i>
<i>that's a big dream.</i>

02:18.201 --> 02:21.403
<i>Me being on Broadway</i>
<i>in</i> Funny Girl <i>as Fanny Brice,</i>

<i>inheriting the mantle</i>
<i>of my idol,</i>

02:23.740 --> 02:27.275
<i>Ms. Barbra Streisand,</i>
<i>that's the culmination</i>

02:27.293 --> 02:29.578
<i>of every dream I've ever had.</i>

02:29.612 --> 02:31.997
<i>Since its premiere in 1964,</i>
Funny Girl <i>has never</i>

02:32.048 --> 02:33.665
<i>been revived on Broadway...</i>
<i>no doubt because</i>

02:33.716 --> 02:35.634
<i>producers haven't been able</i>
<i>to find</i>

02:35.668 --> 02:38.303
<i>an actress capable of filling</i>
<i>Barbra's formidable shoes.</i>

02:38.338 --> 02:41.306
<i>Luckily, I've been grooming</i>
<i>myself for this audition</i>

02:41.341 --> 02:43.642
<i>since I was five,</i>
<i>which is when I first</i>

02:43.676 --> 02:47.246
<i>saw</i> Funny Girl <i>in all</i>
<i>its Technicolor glory.</i>

02:47.280 --> 02:49.314
<i>I heard my dads use the phrase</i>
<i>"star quality" before,</i>

02:49.349 --> 02:53.318
<i>but I never truly understood it</i>
<i>until that moment.</i>

02:53.353 --> 02:56.071
<i>I knew: I needed to be her.</i>

02:56.105 --> 02:59.324
<i>From that point on, it's been</i>
<i>all Barbra, all the time.</i>

02:59.359 --> 03:01.994
<i>Witness my collection:</i>
<i>A feather from</i> Hello, Dolly!;

03:02.028 --> 03:04.496
<i>A yarmulke from</i> Yentl; <i>a boxing</i>
<i>glove from</i> The Main Event;

03:04.531 --> 03:08.333
<i>Signed Playbills; a picture</i>

<i>Mr. Elliott Gould;</i>
<i>Her second husband,</i>

03:10.820 --> 03:12.421
<i>Mr. James Brolin;</i>
<i>And her paramour</i>

<i>of two years, Canadian</i>
<i>Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau.</i>

03:14.874 --> 03:17.843
<i>But I'm not just approaching</i>
<i>this audition as a fangirl.</i>

03:17.927 --> 03:19.711
<i>I'm approaching this</i>
<i>as a professional</i>

03:19.762 --> 03:21.547
<i>who has sworn off men</i>

03:21.598 --> 03:24.132
<i>and rededicated herself</i>
<i>to the art of being Barbra.</i>

03:24.166 --> 03:26.134
<i>Yes, it's a long shot.</i>

03:26.168 --> 03:29.054
<i>Fanny Brice is the King Lear</i>
<i>of musical theatre roles,</i>

03:29.105 --> 03:31.607
<i>and I'm just an unknown</i>
<i>Jewish girl from Ohio,</i>

03:31.641 --> 03:33.942
<i>who came of the age</i>
<i>in a high school glee club.</i>

03:33.977 --> 03:35.527
<i>But then I remind myself,</i>

03:35.562 --> 03:37.563
<i>Barbra, too, was once</i>
<i>an unknown Jewish girl</i>

03:37.614 --> 03:39.114
<i>who sang</i>
<i>in her high school choir.</i>

03:39.148 --> 03:41.199
<i>And</i> Funny Girl <i>made her a star.</i>

03:41.234 --> 03:43.702
<i>So why can't my dreams</i>
<i>come true, too?</i>

03:43.736 --> 03:46.154
Hello, gorgeous.

03:46.188 --> 03:48.624
ROZ: Excuse my jet lag,
I'm fresh off a plane

03:48.658 --> 03:50.709
from North Korea
where I've been training

03:50.743 --> 03:53.045
their swim team with
my assistant Dennis Rodman.

03:53.079 --> 03:54.796
Do you like the new addition
to my wardrobe?

03:54.831 --> 03:56.632
That's right. I've taken over
the Cheerios!

03:56.666 --> 03:58.383
From that Phantom Menace
Sue Sylvester.

03:58.418 --> 04:00.302
Someone with talent had to.

04:00.336 --> 04:01.670
Did I also mention
that I'm in talks

04:01.704 --> 04:03.505
with Miss Oprah Winfrey

04:03.539 --> 04:06.174
to launch my very own
Cheerio! Network?

04:06.208 --> 04:08.560
Like George Jefferson,
I'm movin' on up.

04:08.595 --> 04:10.896
How is your delicate group
of weirdos? Are they still

04:10.930 --> 04:12.714
rattled by that fake
school shooting?

04:12.732 --> 04:14.733
That was a terrifying experience
for those kids.

04:14.767 --> 04:17.069
And the adults.
I'm still having nightmares.

04:17.103 --> 04:18.987
Honey, please.
I'm a child of the ghetto.

04:19.022 --> 04:22.024
I can't sleep at night unless
I hear at least two gunshots.

04:23.109 --> 04:24.743
Hey.

04:24.777 --> 04:26.745
You get a chance
to talk to Finn yet?

04:26.779 --> 04:29.498
No. I'm not ready.
Will, come on.

04:29.532 --> 04:31.066
You need to patch the hole
in this fence

04:31.117 --> 04:32.668
so the squirrels don't escape.

04:32.702 --> 04:34.920
People grow apart, Shannon.
That's life.

04:34.954 --> 04:36.922
Th-There's nothing wrong
with that.

04:36.956 --> 04:39.291
That's what I thought about me
and my sister, Denise.

04:39.342 --> 04:42.210
We used to scrap like grizzlies
in the Arctic,

04:42.244 --> 04:43.462
and then when all that stuff

04:43.513 --> 04:44.963
went down with Cooter,

04:45.014 --> 04:46.431
she helped me out,

04:46.466 --> 04:48.133
and we finally got to talkin'.

04:48.184 --> 04:49.935
I'm more stubborn
than anybody here...

04:49.969 --> 04:52.137
(chuckles) but I swallowed hard

04:52.188 --> 04:53.605
and made amends with her.

04:55.191 --> 04:57.893
It was one of the best things
I've ever done in my life.

04:59.646 --> 05:01.763
Make the effort, Will.

05:06.402 --> 05:08.403
It's worth it.

05:11.207 --> 05:12.874
(school bell ringing)

05:12.909 --> 05:15.877
MARLEY: <i>I, Marley Rose,</i>
<i>have made a decision.</i>

05:15.912 --> 05:18.213
<i>I took that false bottom</i>
<i>out of my desk drawer,</i>

05:18.247 --> 05:20.799
<i>and I'm finally going to let</i>
<i>my songs see the light of day.</i>

05:20.833 --> 05:22.884
<i>I want to be like all those</i>
<i>singer-songwriters.</i>

05:22.919 --> 05:26.555
<i>I look up to: Joni Mitchell,</i>
<i>Norah Jones, Chrissie Hynde.</i>

05:26.589 --> 05:28.507
<i>I've been trying</i>
<i>to bring it up with everyone,</i>

05:28.558 --> 05:30.392
<i>but ever since the gun</i>
<i>went off in school,</i>

05:30.426 --> 05:31.810
<i>everyone's been acting strange.</i>

05:31.844 --> 05:33.478
<i>It's like they've all got PTSD.</i>

05:33.513 --> 05:35.647
BRITTANY: They really want me
to study string theory,

05:35.682 --> 05:37.315
but I'm not all that interested
in arts and crafts.

05:37.350 --> 05:39.317
<i>Brittany's acting weird</i>
<i>because M.I.T. found out</i>

05:39.352 --> 05:40.802
<i>about her S.A.T. score,</i>
<i>and they're pressuring her</i>

05:40.820 --> 05:42.320
<i>for early commitment.</i>

05:42.355 --> 05:44.690
Isn't M.I.T in Europe?
That would suck.

05:44.741 --> 05:46.742
Hey, Tina. Are you
trying out a new look?

05:46.809 --> 05:48.910
It's called steampunk.
It's the next big thing.

05:48.945 --> 05:51.113
Oh. God, I love it.

05:51.147 --> 05:52.864
(Australian accent): Oh, hey there.
You must, uh, be Marley.

05:52.915 --> 05:55.000
Hi, Sam. That's not Sam.
That's Sam's

05:55.034 --> 05:56.585
smarter twin brother, Evan.
Evan Evans.

05:56.619 --> 05:57.836
What a pleasure to meet you.

05:57.870 --> 05:59.454
Oh. Phone's ringing.
Oh, it's my brother.

05:59.488 --> 06:03.175
Oh, hey, Sam, I was actually
just looking for you...

06:03.209 --> 06:05.510
So have you guys heard
who's taking over the Cheerios!?

06:05.545 --> 06:07.763
Yeah, it's insane.
And it made me realize

06:07.797 --> 06:10.382
I have no idea whether I'm
on the Cheerios! Or not.

06:10.433 --> 06:12.601
Like, literally can't remember.

06:12.635 --> 06:13.835
Hey, guys.

06:13.853 --> 06:15.303
Have you seen Evan?
You just missed him.

06:15.337 --> 06:16.054
He went that way.

06:16.105 --> 06:17.806
(groans)

06:17.840 --> 06:20.442
<i>I think Sam might have</i>
<i>a little separation anxiety,</i>

06:20.476 --> 06:23.111
<i>so he's pretending</i>
<i>he has a twin. And then...</i>

06:23.146 --> 06:25.814
<i>there's Unique.</i>
Unique, what are you doing?

06:25.848 --> 06:28.533
Are those birth control pills?
Shh!

06:28.568 --> 06:31.453
Don't blow a girl's cover. Kitty hooked
me up with a prescription for Loestrin,

06:31.487 --> 06:33.288
and I heard that two dolls
a day will turn my Bs

06:33.322 --> 06:34.790
into Ds in no time.

06:34.824 --> 06:37.292
Guys, have you...
seen my twin?

06:37.326 --> 06:38.994
Oh! Getting a call.
Hold on.

06:39.028 --> 06:42.664
Oh, hey. Man, I was
just looking for you!

06:42.698 --> 06:44.966
Unique, you cannot
take birth control.

06:45.001 --> 06:46.868
Why not? Trans kids
everywhere are doing it.

06:46.886 --> 06:48.136
All right, bro. Well,
I'll tell 'em you said hi.

06:48.171 --> 06:49.638
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Have fun at the zoo.

06:49.672 --> 06:51.890
<i>I've just got to build up</i>
<i>the courage to tell everyone</i>

06:51.924 --> 06:54.976
<i>that I want us to perform one</i>
<i>of my songs at regionals.</i>

06:55.011 --> 06:56.678
<i>It would be a dream come true.</i>

06:56.712 --> 06:58.897
WILL: Big news, guys.
I just got a direct tweet

06:58.931 --> 07:00.398
from the Greater Midwest
Regional.

07:00.433 --> 07:02.484
High School Show Choir
Board of Directors.

07:02.518 --> 07:03.902
(light cheering)

07:03.936 --> 07:05.904
The theme
for this year's regionals

07:05.938 --> 07:07.989
is...
Sweaters.

07:08.024 --> 07:08.824
...dreams.

07:08.858 --> 07:10.075
(sighs) Close.

07:10.109 --> 07:11.910
As you know,
some of the past judges

07:11.944 --> 07:13.361
we've had haven't been
that bright,

07:13.395 --> 07:14.279
or that sober,

07:14.330 --> 07:15.747
so our best bet is to take

07:15.782 --> 07:17.415
the dream theme literally.

07:17.450 --> 07:19.201
We'll start out
with "Dream Weaver"

07:19.235 --> 07:20.485
and then we'll segue
into "Sweet Dreams"

07:20.520 --> 07:21.837
and we'll bring it home

07:21.871 --> 07:23.421
with "You Make
My Dreams Come True."

07:23.456 --> 07:24.790
Okay.

07:24.841 --> 07:26.591
Marley, you're frowning.

07:26.626 --> 07:28.960
No. I just don't know
any of those songs.

07:29.011 --> 07:30.095
Well, you'll know them
soon enough

07:30.129 --> 07:31.596
because we're learning them
today.

07:31.631 --> 07:32.848
(clears throat) Maybe...

07:32.882 --> 07:35.016
could we try
some original songs,

07:35.051 --> 07:36.601
like you did two years ago?

07:36.636 --> 07:38.053
Yeah, my twin brother Sam
told me you guys

07:38.087 --> 07:39.638
totally crushed
regionals two years ago

07:39.689 --> 07:40.722
with those sweet tunes.

07:40.756 --> 07:42.390
Well, S... um, Evan,

07:42.424 --> 07:44.693
that was a different time
and a different team.

07:44.727 --> 07:47.863
Mr. Shue, could we at least talk
about the set list?

07:47.897 --> 07:49.698
I mean, when Finn was here,
we got to help...

07:49.732 --> 07:51.399
Do I have to remind you guys
how lucky we are

07:51.433 --> 07:52.701
to even be at regionals?

07:52.735 --> 07:54.202
We're there on a technicality,

07:54.237 --> 07:55.570
which means there's absolutely

07:55.604 --> 07:58.123
no room for even
the smallest of mistakes.

07:58.157 --> 08:00.292
Trust me.

08:00.326 --> 08:01.626
Anybody else have something
they want to say?

08:01.661 --> 08:04.412
Great. Brad, warm 'em up.

08:08.083 --> 08:09.283
(school bell ringing)
As honorary Rachel,

08:09.317 --> 08:11.001
I would like to convene

08:11.036 --> 08:12.419
this secret meeting
of the glee club.

08:12.454 --> 08:13.954
Oh. Sam's sorry
he couldn't make it.

08:13.988 --> 08:15.322
He said
to tell every... Oh.

08:15.340 --> 08:17.174
Just got a text.

08:17.209 --> 08:19.009
He's here.

08:19.044 --> 08:20.261
Oh, hey, Sam.
Hey, Evan.

08:20.295 --> 08:22.496
How long are we gonna
let him do this?

08:22.514 --> 08:24.131
Just let it go.

08:24.165 --> 08:25.933
It's like waking a sleepwalker.
It might kill him.

08:25.967 --> 08:27.685
Hey, guys. Sorry I'm
late. What'd I miss?

08:27.719 --> 08:29.470
What you missed
was Mr. Shue's set list.

08:29.504 --> 08:30.804
It's gonna lose us regionals.

08:30.838 --> 08:32.606
Oh, yeah, Evan was saying
something about that.

08:32.640 --> 08:36.110
"Dream Weaver." Great song,
but it's from 1975.

08:36.144 --> 08:37.861
"Sweet Dreams (Are Made
of This)." Amazing.

08:37.895 --> 08:39.363
Released in 1982.

08:39.397 --> 08:40.847
"You Make My Dreams Come True."

08:40.865 --> 08:42.316
Originally performed in 1981,

08:42.350 --> 08:43.734
and then performed again
by the glee club in a mash-up

08:43.784 --> 08:45.569
that we did last year,

08:45.620 --> 08:46.870
which Mr. Shue
didn't even remember.

08:46.905 --> 08:48.289
He's completely lost touch.

08:48.323 --> 08:49.957
We're screwed.
Can I get a witness?

08:49.991 --> 08:51.158
We need to do current songs,

08:51.192 --> 08:53.360
and if we do,
I know we can win.

08:53.378 --> 08:54.962
(clears throat) Uh, guys...

08:54.996 --> 08:56.547
can I say something?

08:56.581 --> 08:58.882
I wrote some songs.
What if we performed those?

08:58.917 --> 09:02.052
Please. No one wants to hear a
song about a fat mom. Okay.

09:02.087 --> 09:04.004
What about...
Or a song about barfing.

09:04.038 --> 09:06.390
But what about a song... Or a
song about loving an octoroon.

09:06.424 --> 09:08.676
BLAINE: All right, all
right, all right, let's...

09:08.710 --> 09:10.978
let's get serious.
We need to start brainstorming.

09:11.012 --> 09:13.213
We'll pick a new set list
and then we'll break the news

09:13.231 --> 09:15.733
(bell ringing)
to Mr. Shue.

09:15.767 --> 09:19.386
(Wagner's "Ride
of the Valkyries" playing)

09:22.941 --> 09:25.442
(students chanting):
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

09:25.493 --> 09:26.827
(neck cracks)

09:26.861 --> 09:29.730
(knuckles crack)

09:30.582 --> 09:32.082
(cheering, whooping)

09:32.117 --> 09:33.834
(Puck shouts)

09:33.868 --> 09:35.402
(cheering, whooping)

09:35.420 --> 09:37.421
(sizzling)

09:37.455 --> 09:39.423
Excuse me, ladies.
Where are your tickets?

09:39.457 --> 09:40.791
Wait, we need tickets?

09:40.842 --> 09:42.009
Rules are rules.

09:42.043 --> 09:43.844
Wait, wait, wait.

09:43.878 --> 09:45.546
You both seem
like really nice girls,

09:45.580 --> 09:47.014
and I don't want you
to miss out on all the fun...

09:48.383 --> 09:51.268
...so I'm willing to make
an exception just this once.

09:51.303 --> 09:53.253
Oh, my God,
you're such a sweetheart.

09:53.271 --> 09:55.939
I am. Mm. Thing is,

09:55.974 --> 09:58.442
if I let you go for free
and anybody hears about that,

09:58.476 --> 10:00.110
the whole system
could collapse.

10:00.145 --> 10:02.696
So I'm gonna need you
to pay me with your bikini tops.

10:02.731 --> 10:04.565
Okay.
Okay.

10:04.599 --> 10:06.450
("Ride of the Valkyries"
continues)

10:06.484 --> 10:07.951
Okay.

10:09.070 --> 10:11.121
(cheering, whooping)

10:17.245 --> 10:19.163
Ah! Mr. Shue! Hey!
Whoa...

10:19.214 --> 10:20.547
Welcome to Geneva Hall,

10:20.582 --> 10:22.916
aka Chez Puckerman.
Noah, I-I didn't know

10:22.950 --> 10:25.135
you were enrolled here. Well,
I'm not technically enrolled,

10:25.170 --> 10:27.805
but, you know, I'm just
auditing a few classes.

10:27.839 --> 10:28.972
Do you even know
what that means?

10:29.007 --> 10:30.841
Got to go.

Looks like you're really

10:43.137 --> 10:45.272
I hope you're finding time
to make it to class.

10:45.306 --> 10:47.324
You know, Mr. Shue, I don't
need you to come into my house

10:47.359 --> 10:48.909
and tell me how to live my life.

10:48.943 --> 10:50.277
You're right.

10:50.311 --> 10:52.830
Look, I-I came here
to apologize.

10:52.864 --> 10:54.948
I was still stinging from
what happened at the wedding

10:54.982 --> 10:57.334
and then when you told me
about... kissing Emma,

10:57.369 --> 10:59.953
I totally mishandled
the situation.

10:59.987 --> 11:02.840
And now I really see that we only
have so many days, you know?

11:02.874 --> 11:05.008
I want you to come back and
help me coach the glee club.

11:05.043 --> 11:07.294
They need you.
I need you.

11:07.328 --> 11:10.297
PUCK: Finn! I just got us invited
to the Delta Kappa Chi frat party

11:10.331 --> 11:12.966
tonight. It's supposed to be the
biggest party of the year. Yeah!

11:13.000 --> 11:14.101
Yeah!
(chuckles)

11:14.135 --> 11:15.853
I got to shave my hello giggles.

11:15.887 --> 11:17.438
Good to see you, Mr. Shue.
Yeah.

11:17.505 --> 11:18.522
Thanks, Puck.

11:18.556 --> 11:20.691
Thanks, but no, thanks.

11:20.725 --> 11:23.944
I'm not expecting things to just
go back to normal right away.

11:23.978 --> 11:25.279
I'm willing to work at this.

11:25.313 --> 11:26.864
Well, I'm not.

11:26.898 --> 11:28.615
There's just some things
you can't come back from.

11:28.650 --> 11:29.850
It's a nice offer,

11:29.868 --> 11:31.568
but as you can see,

11:31.619 --> 11:34.204
I'm pretty busy with college.

11:47.352 --> 11:49.870
(school bell ringing) All right,
guys, let's get right into it.

11:49.888 --> 11:51.505
And remember,
the trick is the change

11:51.539 --> 11:52.806
in vocal quality
from the smooth,

11:52.841 --> 11:54.892
sultry sounds of Gary Wright

11:54.926 --> 11:56.260
to the commanding
tone of Annie Lennox,

11:56.311 --> 11:58.262
and then back to the poppy fun
of Darryl Hall.

11:58.313 --> 11:59.480
Uh, Mr. Shue?

11:59.514 --> 12:00.898
Um, we kind of got
together as a group

12:00.932 --> 12:02.716
after you gave us
these songs yesterday, and

12:02.734 --> 12:05.068
we came up with
some... alternatives.

12:06.438 --> 12:08.439
Why would you do that?

12:10.942 --> 12:13.911
Mm, you might need some woman
parts to help you sell that.

12:13.945 --> 12:15.195
I'll go get Evan.

12:15.229 --> 12:17.247
Sam, sit down.

12:17.282 --> 12:18.665
Honestly, I don't even know

12:18.700 --> 12:19.867
what's going on
in this room anymore.

12:19.901 --> 12:21.201
What happened to you guys?

12:21.235 --> 12:22.286
Openly defying me?

12:22.337 --> 12:23.704
Unique, you need
to tone it down

12:23.738 --> 12:25.038
with the whole boob thing.

12:25.072 --> 12:27.341
Sam, we all know you
don't have a twin brother,

12:27.375 --> 12:28.709
and frankly, it's distracting.

12:28.743 --> 12:30.544
And, Blaine, I am
disappointed in you

12:30.578 --> 12:32.212
for allowing this to go on.

12:32.246 --> 12:34.431
I'm sorry,
but we're just trying to...

12:34.466 --> 12:36.600
No, what you were trying
to do is not rehearsing

12:36.634 --> 12:38.936
the song list that I gave you,
and that is unacceptable.

12:38.970 --> 12:41.221
So here's what's
going to happen.

12:41.255 --> 12:43.223
I'm going to go
to the teachers' lounge

12:43.257 --> 12:46.944
and get the coffee that I
skipped to get here early,

12:46.978 --> 12:48.862
and when I get back
in five minutes,

12:48.897 --> 12:51.431
you <i>will</i> be ready
to rehearse... my songs.

12:53.000 --> 12:59.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:05.997 --> 13:07.447
Okay, so let's start
with the <i>Funny Girl</i> classics.

13:07.465 --> 13:08.632
I know them by heart.

13:08.666 --> 13:10.467
But anyway, I just
want to go over...

13:10.502 --> 13:13.119
I always seem to find you
the piano, rehearsing.

13:13.137 --> 13:15.138
Shelby.

13:15.173 --> 13:17.457
Oh, my God,
what are you doing here?!

13:17.475 --> 13:19.309
I'm trying to track you down.

13:19.344 --> 13:21.595
I wanted to find you before
your <i>Funny Girl</i> audition.

13:21.629 --> 13:23.564
You found out about that?
We're Facebook

13:23.631 --> 13:25.632
friends, Rachel. You
started posting as Barbra.

13:25.650 --> 13:26.767
I noticed.
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

13:26.801 --> 13:28.185
I just felt... a little weird.

13:28.236 --> 13:30.320
You know, I know
that you have the same affection

13:30.355 --> 13:33.156
with <i>Funny Girl</i> as I do, and I just...
You didn't want to remind me

13:33.191 --> 13:35.809
that I never got to play the
role, and now it's too late?

13:35.827 --> 13:37.661
I love my life. I do.

13:37.695 --> 13:40.414
It's not the life that I
always imagined I'd be living,

13:40.448 --> 13:42.115
but I have Beth, and I have

13:42.149 --> 13:43.500
this new Broadway
Daycare business,

13:43.535 --> 13:46.119
and we're both in
the same city now,

13:46.153 --> 13:48.789
so I get to see you a lot more.

13:48.823 --> 13:50.657
I have no regrets.

13:50.675 --> 13:54.711
In fact, as much as it was
my dream to maybe study

13:54.762 --> 13:57.047
at a school like NYADA, and, um,

13:57.098 --> 13:59.182
perform songs like that

13:59.217 --> 14:01.184
on a Broadway stage... Shelby.

14:01.219 --> 14:05.022
...my bigger, better
dream now is to see my

14:05.056 --> 14:06.974
incredibly beautiful daughter
perform those songs.

14:07.008 --> 14:11.011
Just... not at
your audition.

14:11.029 --> 14:12.696
Honey, you can't do Barbra.
What?!

14:12.730 --> 14:15.566
No. Fanny Brice is
the most iconic role.

14:15.617 --> 14:17.651
Okay, this is...
this is the only way to do it.

14:17.685 --> 14:20.320
Yeah, Hamlet's an iconic role,
and it's been done differently

14:20.354 --> 14:22.656
and successfully by Laurence
Olivier, Kenneth Branagh,

14:22.690 --> 14:25.042
Richard Burton, Keanu Reeves...

14:25.076 --> 14:27.544
Okay, Hamlet is different.
This is Fanny.

14:27.579 --> 14:29.580
Yes, and they cast Barbra
as Fanny

14:29.631 --> 14:30.747
because she was one-of-a-kind.

14:30.798 --> 14:31.798
She was an original.

14:31.833 --> 14:33.417
If the producers are smart,

14:33.468 --> 14:35.168
they're not gonna be
looking for some carbon copy.

14:35.202 --> 14:37.004
They're gonna want a fresh
interpretation, someone

14:37.038 --> 14:39.506
that can put their own stamp
on the role.

14:39.540 --> 14:42.092
Well, I've just been learning.

14:42.143 --> 14:44.144
Barbra's entire
repertoire, so...

14:44.178 --> 14:45.729
It's okay. You have time.

14:45.763 --> 14:47.230
We'll find something.
I'll help you.

14:47.265 --> 14:49.483
This may not be 100% right,

14:49.517 --> 14:52.769
but maybe it will inspire you.

14:52.820 --> 14:55.355
And any excuse

14:55.389 --> 14:57.407
to sing next to you.

Dudes. Dudes, I'm Matt Cromley,

19:29.612 --> 19:30.996
house president.

19:31.030 --> 19:33.248
This is Chip.
He's in charge of pledging.

19:33.283 --> 19:35.450
You guys want us to
pledge or something?

19:35.502 --> 19:37.419
Under normal circumstances,
we'd ask you to pledge.

19:37.453 --> 19:40.205
Then you'd have to go through
a six-week hazing program.

19:40.239 --> 19:43.425
But dudes, this is
our biggest party of the year,

19:43.459 --> 19:45.961
and when the stereo broke,
we all thought it was ruined.

19:46.012 --> 19:48.046
CHIP: You saved our
house and its honor

19:48.080 --> 19:50.299
and its position
as top party house on campus.

19:50.350 --> 19:53.185
Well, Puck and I... we do
have musical training.

19:53.219 --> 19:55.053
Glee club?
That's awesome.

19:55.087 --> 19:57.389
So, listen, even though
you guys are apparently gay,

19:57.423 --> 19:59.441
we'd like to invite you
to become brothers here.

19:59.475 --> 20:02.110
No hazing or anything.
Just say yes, and you're in.

20:02.145 --> 20:04.146
Yeah.

20:04.197 --> 20:06.114
The sacred ritual of partying!

20:06.149 --> 20:07.316
Oh! Yeah!
Yeah!

20:07.367 --> 20:08.951
(groaning and laughing)

20:08.985 --> 20:10.619

20:14.574 --> 20:16.041

20:16.075 --> 20:17.793
I'm also naturally
enhancing my breasts.

20:17.827 --> 20:19.494
Every night, I rub
them with cocoa butter,

20:19.546 --> 20:21.830
Vitamin E and wild yams.

20:21.881 --> 20:23.999
Yes, uh, has anybody,
uh, seen Sam?

20:24.050 --> 20:26.084
Yeah, I think
he's behind that curtain.

20:32.458 --> 20:33.475
Sorry I'm late.

20:33.509 --> 20:35.010
What's up, Marley? Brad?

20:35.061 --> 20:38.096
Uh, I wrote a song.

20:38.130 --> 20:39.398
I don't know if it's any good.

20:39.432 --> 20:41.099
I just... I want
to hear it out loud.

20:41.133 --> 20:42.651
And no,

20:43.937 --> 20:46.438
or bad Taylor Swift
boyfriend drama.

20:46.472 --> 20:47.940
It's about

20:47.974 --> 20:50.325
how much
friends like you mean to me.

20:50.360 --> 20:51.326
Lord, I am crying already.

20:51.361 --> 20:53.111
(soft laughter)

20:53.145 --> 20:55.831
I just saw how upset you guys
got after Mr. Shue yelled at us,

20:55.865 --> 20:58.333
and you three seemed
to take the worst part of it.

20:58.368 --> 21:00.035
So, I wrote this song
to make you

21:00.086 --> 21:03.288
feel better,
as corny as that sounds.

21:03.322 --> 21:04.506
Will you sing it with me?

21:04.540 --> 21:06.842
No. Just kidding.

21:06.876 --> 21:08.844
Of course we would.

Child, it's the soundtrack
to my life.

24:06.722 --> 24:08.306
Do you have any more
songs like these?

24:08.340 --> 24:09.724
Yeah, a couple.

24:09.776 --> 24:12.060
Maybe we can meet up
again and sing them.

24:12.111 --> 24:14.112
No. Forget that. No, what we
need to do is tell everyone.

24:14.147 --> 24:16.398
We have to tell Mr. Shue about this.
MARLEY: No.

24:16.449 --> 24:19.184
He made it pretty clear
he's not interested.

24:30.924 --> 24:32.358

about Brody,

24:46.272 --> 24:48.140

that I'm sorry

24:48.175 --> 24:49.675

you a debt of gratitude.

24:56.449 --> 24:58.084
Just, um...

24:58.118 --> 25:00.803
you know, I wish that you
would've stayed and...

25:00.837 --> 25:03.723
hung around a little longer.

25:03.757 --> 25:06.759
Next time, I promise.

25:06.793 --> 25:09.061
So, how is college?

25:09.096 --> 25:11.097

25:11.131 --> 25:12.315

25:12.349 --> 25:14.233

25:14.267 --> 25:15.484

25:15.519 --> 25:16.652

25:16.687 --> 25:17.653
it's amazing.

25:17.688 --> 25:18.821
Every night, we go out,

25:18.855 --> 25:19.989
we-we're meeting new people...

25:20.023 --> 25:21.157
Well, then, that sounds amazing.

25:21.191 --> 25:22.658
I'm... it's really great.

25:22.693 --> 25:24.694
I, uh, actually I just,

25:24.745 --> 25:26.028
I needed to, um,

25:26.079 --> 25:28.080
to ask you something.

25:28.115 --> 25:30.700
Let me guess:
<i>Funny Girl</i> auditions.

25:32.152 --> 25:34.503
I knew you'd remember.

25:34.538 --> 25:36.339
Finn, I can't believe
that this moment is happening,

25:36.373 --> 25:38.507
and I know that
this is a long shot,

25:38.542 --> 25:42.044
but I need to find
the most perfect song to sing,

25:42.095 --> 25:43.662
and-and-and no Barbra.

25:45.549 --> 25:48.467
You're one of the most
unique talents in the world.

25:48.501 --> 25:49.935
You always shine your brightest

25:49.970 --> 25:51.887
when you do something
personal, something

25:51.938 --> 25:54.023
intimately important
that defines you.

25:54.057 --> 25:56.058
So just do something
that takes you back

25:56.109 --> 25:57.693
to the roots of your passion.

25:57.728 --> 25:59.862
That's what people want to see,

25:59.896 --> 26:02.281
and that's what makes
the best impression.

26:02.315 --> 26:05.034
Make those producers
fall in love with you

26:05.068 --> 26:06.952
in that moment on the stage.

26:06.987 --> 26:10.039
And I know you have it in you.

26:10.073 --> 26:11.540
(sighs)

26:11.575 --> 26:13.209
Wow.

26:13.243 --> 26:14.493
Thank you, that was, uh...

26:14.527 --> 26:17.380
perfect advice.

26:17.414 --> 26:19.715
You'll be great.

26:19.750 --> 26:22.918
Can't wait to come
to a show sometime.

26:22.969 --> 26:24.970
Call me as soon
as it's over, okay?

26:25.005 --> 26:27.807
I will.

26:33.764 --> 26:35.765
(soprano singing aria)

26:44.891 --> 26:48.277
Thank you for... that.

26:48.328 --> 26:50.413
(chuckles)
We will let you know.

26:50.447 --> 26:52.748
Thanks.
This is what you get

26:52.783 --> 26:54.784

WOMAN:
Well,

29:51.962 --> 29:54.430
thank you, Ms.... Berry.

29:54.464 --> 29:55.764
That was something...

29:55.799 --> 29:58.267
quite different.

29:58.301 --> 29:59.435
Sorry.

29:59.469 --> 30:00.803
What?
Rachel.

30:00.854 --> 30:02.104
Suddenly, something
happened to you

30:02.138 --> 30:03.439
in the middle of the song.

30:03.473 --> 30:05.107
What was going on there?

30:05.141 --> 30:07.893
I was thinking
about my friends.

30:07.927 --> 30:10.646
Um, how I wouldn't be
the person I am today,

30:10.697 --> 30:12.031
standing in front of you,

30:12.065 --> 30:13.616
doing what I'm doing

30:13.650 --> 30:16.735
right now if they hadn't
shown me that I could.

30:17.821 --> 30:19.655
If they hadn't believed in me.

30:21.541 --> 30:22.825
Thank you.

30:32.631 --> 30:33.798
(grunts)

30:33.832 --> 30:35.166
(sniffs) Dude...

30:35.184 --> 30:37.001
Dude, yourself.

30:37.019 --> 30:39.170
What the hell is this?

30:39.188 --> 30:41.222
(grunts)

30:41.273 --> 30:43.558
Uh, it's from my sociology prof.

30:43.609 --> 30:45.360
Guess I missed another test.
No biggie.

30:45.394 --> 30:47.145
Crap, what time is it?

30:47.179 --> 30:48.346
I'm late to play Frolf
with that Cromley guy.

30:48.364 --> 30:51.366
Dude, it is a biggie.
It's a very biggie.

30:51.400 --> 30:53.401
Isn't that class one of your
requirements for your teaching major?

30:53.452 --> 30:55.036
Don't worry,
I'm gonna pass that class.

30:55.070 --> 30:56.538
The... the final's worth,
like, 60% of the grade.

30:56.572 --> 30:57.739
I'll just cram and ace it.

30:57.790 --> 30:58.790
Is that your dream?

30:58.824 --> 30:59.857
To barely skate through school

30:59.875 --> 31:01.526
and become a mediocre teacher?

31:01.560 --> 31:03.878
Wait, since when do you care
about school so much, man?

31:03.913 --> 31:05.213
You're not even in school.
Dude.

31:05.247 --> 31:06.697
This isn't high school anymore.

31:06.715 --> 31:08.049
It's not just about potential.

31:08.083 --> 31:10.034
This is the real casaba.

31:10.052 --> 31:11.085
So you're a crappy
high school student.

31:11.136 --> 31:12.220
Who cares?

31:12.254 --> 31:13.471
But if you're a crappy teacher,

31:13.505 --> 31:14.756
that means something.

31:14.807 --> 31:16.507
(sighs)

31:16.541 --> 31:18.092
Look.

31:18.143 --> 31:19.344
This has been awesome.

31:19.378 --> 31:21.045
I'm having the time of my life.

31:21.063 --> 31:22.597
And doing it with my best bud

31:22.648 --> 31:24.215
is a dream come true.

31:24.233 --> 31:26.050
But last night, I was
in bed with three chicks,

31:26.068 --> 31:27.402
and I was thinking,
"What is this all about

31:27.436 --> 31:28.553
for you, Puckerman?"

31:28.587 --> 31:30.889
So, what'd you come up with?

31:30.923 --> 31:32.440
I want to show all of 'em.

31:32.491 --> 31:35.276
Everyone who ever
crossed the street

31:35.327 --> 31:36.411
when I came down the sidewalk

31:36.445 --> 31:38.229
or didn't call on me in class

31:38.247 --> 31:39.664
'cause they just assumed
I'd fart my answer,

31:39.698 --> 31:41.950
or told me I'd be
pumping gas someday

31:42.001 --> 31:44.235
that we are worth something.

31:44.253 --> 31:46.788
That we are more
than they say we are.

31:46.839 --> 31:48.289
(sighs)

31:48.340 --> 31:50.425
I'm not saying we
need to stop having

31:50.459 --> 31:52.377
a good time,
but partying this hard,

31:52.411 --> 31:54.078
skipping out on tests,

31:54.096 --> 31:56.247
that's their vision
of who we are.

31:56.265 --> 31:57.915
Doesn't have to be ours.

31:57.933 --> 32:00.602
So what are you gonna do,
like, enroll here now?

32:00.636 --> 32:02.103
I still think school's
for suckers,

32:02.137 --> 32:03.805
but I'm gonna stay here
and write my screenplay

32:03.856 --> 32:05.089
and be on your ass

32:05.107 --> 32:07.141
24-7 to make sure
that you become

32:07.192 --> 32:08.943
the best teacher
that you can be.

32:08.978 --> 32:10.594
We've always known
we were special.

32:10.613 --> 32:12.864
This is our chance to prove it.

32:14.867 --> 32:16.284
Yeah.

32:21.123 --> 32:23.207
(warbles) Ew.

32:23.242 --> 32:24.442
(laughs) Get to work.

32:24.460 --> 32:25.960
I'll grab the iron and make us

32:25.995 --> 32:27.745
some grilled cheeses.

32:27.779 --> 32:29.780
(groans)

32:35.120 --> 32:37.639
(school bell rings)

32:37.673 --> 32:38.973
Mm.

32:39.008 --> 32:40.892
You wanted to see us, Coach?
Yes.

32:40.926 --> 32:42.644
Come on in and have a seat.

32:42.678 --> 32:44.395
It is my understanding

32:44.430 --> 32:46.297
that I have inherited you

32:46.315 --> 32:49.067
as co-captains
of the Cheerios!

32:49.101 --> 32:50.968
And by looking at the
two of you right now,

32:50.986 --> 32:54.072
that makes me
extremely suspicious.

32:54.106 --> 32:55.807
Suspicious? Why?

32:55.874 --> 32:57.308
Oh, I understand why.

32:57.326 --> 32:58.993
Coach Sylvester's
daughter Robin is here.

32:59.028 --> 33:00.028
Sue Sylvester

33:00.079 --> 33:02.330
is as old as the hills,

33:02.364 --> 33:05.166
so when she gave birth
to her fully grown,

33:05.200 --> 33:08.202
16-year-old baby with
Down syndrome, it was

33:08.253 --> 33:09.820
a miracle, and she wanted

33:09.838 --> 33:12.807
to bring her to school every day
and show her off.

33:12.841 --> 33:14.926
You're the one that makes
me suspicious,

33:14.960 --> 33:16.160
Fruity Fonzie.

33:16.178 --> 33:17.845
You ain't never done
a cheerleading routine

33:17.880 --> 33:19.497
in your life,

33:19.515 --> 33:21.499
but somehow you get.

33:21.517 --> 33:23.134
Sue Sylvester to make you

33:23.168 --> 33:24.835
co-captain of the Cheerios!,

33:24.853 --> 33:27.671
and then, three weeks later,
out of nowhere,

33:27.690 --> 33:29.724
Sue Sylvester gets fired.

33:29.775 --> 33:30.942
That makes me

33:30.976 --> 33:32.543
real suspicious.

33:32.578 --> 33:35.730
That makes me think
that you used your handsome

33:35.781 --> 33:38.516
fruity voodoo powers
and put a hex on her

33:38.534 --> 33:41.619
that caused her to bring a gun
to school for no reason

33:41.653 --> 33:44.539
and get real clumsy
so she drops it twice

33:44.573 --> 33:46.207
and it goes off both times.

33:46.241 --> 33:47.692
That sounds like

33:47.726 --> 33:50.661
some dark-sided, fruity
voodoo stuff to me.

33:50.695 --> 33:52.380
But that didn't really happen!

33:52.414 --> 33:54.031
Blaine had nothing
to do with it!

33:54.049 --> 33:55.583
How do you know?
Were you there?

33:55.634 --> 33:57.034
No.

33:57.052 --> 33:58.669
Exactly.
So here's

33:58.703 --> 34:00.221
the deal... if you
want to stay

34:00.255 --> 34:02.706
on board as co-captain
of the Cheerios!,

34:02.725 --> 34:06.210
you're gonna have to take
a blood oath and loyalty pledge.

34:06.228 --> 34:08.429
What? A blood oath?

34:08.480 --> 34:09.647
Is-is that even safe?

34:09.681 --> 34:10.715
Probably not.

34:10.748 --> 34:11.949
So we'll just take the oath.

34:11.984 --> 34:13.217
Repeat after me.

34:13.252 --> 34:16.571
I, Fruity Fonzie
and adult baby Robin...

34:16.605 --> 34:21.159
BOTH: I, Fruity Fonzie
and adult baby Robin...

34:21.193 --> 34:24.395
...do solemnly swear... BOTH:.
..do solemnly swear...

34:24.429 --> 34:29.117
...to <i>never</i> put a hex
on Coach Roz Washington.

34:29.168 --> 34:30.900
To <i>never</i> To <i>never</i>

34:30.918 --> 34:34.172
hex on Coach Roz Washington. To...
on Coach Roz Washington.

34:34.206 --> 34:37.507
Causing her to bring a gun to
school so she gets real clumsy

34:37.543 --> 34:40.578
and drops it and it goes off
twice in a row.

34:40.596 --> 34:42.179
BOTH: Causing her to
bring a gun to school

34:42.214 --> 34:44.047
so she gets real clumsy
and drops it

34:44.081 --> 34:46.067
so it goes off twice in a row.

34:46.101 --> 34:47.418
So help me God.

34:47.436 --> 34:48.753
BOTH:
So help me God.

34:48.786 --> 34:49.937
You are free to go.

34:53.275 --> 34:54.475
(bell ringing)

34:55.527 --> 34:57.278
Becky, wait up.

34:57.312 --> 34:59.781
Hurry up, I'm gonna be
late for calculus.

34:59.815 --> 35:03.401
Becky, um, you were acting
particularly strange

35:03.435 --> 35:05.319
in there just now.

35:05.370 --> 35:06.654
Do you know something I don't

35:06.705 --> 35:08.122
about what happened
with Coach Sue?

35:08.157 --> 35:11.108
Mind your own gay business,
gay Blaine.

35:11.126 --> 35:13.411
I don't know anything!

35:13.445 --> 35:15.079
(groans)

35:16.448 --> 35:18.049
(groans)

35:33.849 --> 35:35.900
(distance cheering and applause)
(sighs)

35:37.486 --> 35:39.854
(cheering and applause
continues)

35:44.693 --> 35:46.077
(cheering and applause
stops) FINN: Mr. Shue?

35:49.164 --> 35:50.665
You were right.

35:51.667 --> 35:52.984
About what?

35:53.018 --> 35:54.619
(chuckles)

35:54.653 --> 35:55.986
Me.

35:56.004 --> 35:58.656
N-Needing to get my focus back.

35:58.674 --> 36:02.176
So I-I talked to the Dean
of Students about your offer,

36:02.211 --> 36:06.214
and she said she's willing
to give me college credit

36:06.265 --> 36:08.683
for all the time
that I spend here helping out.

36:08.717 --> 36:11.886
Is that your way of saying
apology accepted?

36:11.937 --> 36:14.388
That's my way of saying
I'm willing to come back.

36:14.439 --> 36:15.839
But if I do,

36:15.858 --> 36:19.343
things have got to be different.

36:19.361 --> 36:21.729
No more fetching your coffee

36:21.780 --> 36:25.015
or picking up
your dry cleaning.

36:25.033 --> 36:27.618
I mean, I don't want
to come back to be a gopher.

36:29.071 --> 36:31.022
It's got to be a partnership.

36:31.056 --> 36:32.690
I want to be treated
like an equal.

36:32.708 --> 36:34.492
Like a...

36:34.526 --> 36:36.360
like a teacher.

36:38.397 --> 36:41.582
And then you bring your best
and I bring my best

36:41.633 --> 36:43.551
and we go get another trophy.

36:45.220 --> 36:46.721
That all seems fair.

36:46.755 --> 36:49.373
But I also have a condition.

36:49.408 --> 36:51.893
Let's just move past this.

36:52.928 --> 36:55.713
Right.

37:05.862 --> 37:07.363
(bell ringing)
Looking good, Unique.

37:08.582 --> 37:10.950
(chuckles) You, too, Tina.

37:10.984 --> 37:12.201
Very Jules Verne.

37:13.153 --> 37:15.538
Hey, Blaine. Sam.

37:15.589 --> 37:17.540
I'm Evan. Sam moved to Alaska.

37:17.591 --> 37:20.960
Oh. Well-well, tell him
he's welcome back anytime.

37:23.930 --> 37:25.798
(sighs)

37:30.103 --> 37:33.055
So... just about 20 years ago,

37:33.106 --> 37:35.391
I was sitting right
where you are now.

37:35.442 --> 37:37.309
I was co-captain
of the soccer team

37:37.343 --> 37:39.145
with a forehead full of acne

37:39.179 --> 37:42.031
and a dream of being
the next Vanilla Ice. (Chuckles)

37:42.065 --> 37:43.566
And standing

37:43.617 --> 37:45.651
right here was Mrs. Adler.

37:45.685 --> 37:49.321
She constantly mumbled
to herself and

37:49.355 --> 37:51.257
she stuffed used Kleenex
up her sleeves.

37:51.291 --> 37:54.660
We all were convinced
that she was crazy.

37:54.694 --> 37:56.662
But you know what?

37:56.696 --> 37:58.664
That's why we loved her...

37:58.698 --> 38:00.199
because we were crazy, too.

38:01.301 --> 38:03.752
This is the room
that always felt like home.

38:03.804 --> 38:06.755
Maybe because we knew
Lillian Adler loved music

38:06.807 --> 38:08.841
almost as much as she loved us.

38:10.210 --> 38:12.094
And that's how I feel about you.

38:12.145 --> 38:14.680
Every one of you.

38:14.714 --> 38:16.849
And-and I'm sorry
if I made any of you feel

38:16.883 --> 38:18.851
like you don't have
a voice in this room.

38:18.885 --> 38:20.102
You do.

38:21.488 --> 38:23.439
And I know someone else
who does, too.

38:23.490 --> 38:26.192
(snaps fingers) ARTIE: My man!

38:26.226 --> 38:28.277
(laughter, cheering)

38:28.328 --> 38:31.280
Finn and I are gonna be
working together as a team.

38:31.331 --> 38:32.865
Equal partners.

38:32.899 --> 38:35.234
And we are not gonna
eat, sleep or breathe

38:35.252 --> 38:36.785
until you've blasted
through regionals

38:36.837 --> 38:38.704
and earned your rightful spot
at nationals.

38:38.738 --> 38:40.072
Yes! Yes!
(cheering and applause)

38:42.676 --> 38:43.792
All right, down to business.

38:43.844 --> 38:45.628
Marley, you're up.
Okay.

38:45.679 --> 38:47.630
I haven't quite memorized
"Dream Weaver" yet,

38:47.681 --> 38:49.765
but I think I have "Sweet
Dreams." Didn't I tell you?

38:49.799 --> 38:51.300
Those are out.

38:51.351 --> 38:54.053
I want you to teach us one
of your original songs.

38:54.087 --> 38:56.388
If that's okay.

38:56.422 --> 38:58.607
I'd love that.

38:58.642 --> 39:01.143
So shall it be written!
So shall it be done!

39:01.194 --> 39:02.895
(cheering and applause)

39:11.488 --> 39:13.239
(metallic creaking)

39:19.496 --> 39:23.332
So, what is Broadway
Daycare exactly?

39:23.383 --> 39:26.585
(sighs) All the show people who have
kids... while they're rehearsing

39:26.619 --> 39:28.754
or performing... they send them
to Shelby's studio

39:28.788 --> 39:31.307
and she teaches them,
like, dance routines

39:31.341 --> 39:33.175
and songs and plays
theatre games with them.

39:33.226 --> 39:35.761
It's like <i>Fame</i> for toddlers.

39:37.564 --> 39:39.515
Well,

39:39.566 --> 39:41.600
no news is good news, right?

39:41.634 --> 39:43.485
Cookie?

39:43.520 --> 39:46.855
At this point, if I haven't
heard anything...

39:46.907 --> 39:49.692
Life goes on.

39:49.743 --> 39:51.944
You know,
Fanny was just a dream.

39:51.978 --> 39:54.530
I read on BroadwayWorld.com that they're
doing a production of <i>Sweeney Todd</i>

39:54.581 --> 39:56.782
at the Pasadena Playhouse,
and... I don't know... I think.

39:56.816 --> 39:58.834
Johanna could be a good role for me.
Do you regret

39:58.868 --> 40:00.536
not doing Barbra
for the audition?

40:01.588 --> 40:03.589
No way.

40:03.623 --> 40:05.958
Honestly, something so special
and something magical

40:05.992 --> 40:08.294
happened in that room, and
if those producers are too...

40:08.328 --> 40:10.629
narrow-minded
or star-obsessed...

40:10.663 --> 40:12.298
(phone vibrating)

40:12.332 --> 40:13.832
Oh, my God.

40:15.385 --> 40:16.602
Oh, my God, it's a number
I don't recognize.

40:16.636 --> 40:18.637
What do I do? What do I do?
Uh,

40:18.671 --> 40:20.639
ans-ans-answer it. Answer it. Yes, yes, yes.
Pick it up? Okay.

40:20.673 --> 40:22.641
Hello?

40:22.675 --> 40:24.676
Uh, yes, this is she.

40:27.147 --> 40:30.115
Uh, yeah, of-of cour...
of course.

40:30.150 --> 40:33.118
Yes. Yes.

40:33.153 --> 40:36.155
Thank you so much. Thank you.

40:39.743 --> 40:41.493
That was...
one of the producers.

40:41.527 --> 40:43.195
And?

40:44.581 --> 40:46.548
And I got a callback for Fanny!

40:46.583 --> 40:48.500
(laughing) I got a callback!
