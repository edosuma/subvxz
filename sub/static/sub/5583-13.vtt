00:02.603 --> 00:03.571
Previously on Empire:

00:03.604 --> 00:05.139
I'm very excited to be the new

00:05.173 --> 00:06.640
Chief Executive Officer
of Empire Enterprises.

00:06.674 --> 00:07.975
Excuse me,

00:08.008 --> 00:09.477
you never mentioned Lucious.

00:09.510 --> 00:10.511
Who's Lucious?

00:10.544 --> 00:13.481
See that? They bringing in
Frank Gathers.

00:13.514 --> 00:14.482
That's your little girl.

00:14.515 --> 00:16.050
Yeah, that's my girl.

00:16.084 --> 00:18.152
Who's playing the role of
Bolingbroke in the video?

00:18.186 --> 00:21.189
Hey, Freda,
say hi to Harper Scott.

00:21.222 --> 00:23.023
You're acting paranoid
right now.

00:23.057 --> 00:24.392
I'm taking care of
myself, honey.
Are you?

00:24.425 --> 00:27.228
I am. I'm taking my medication
every single day, I am.

00:27.261 --> 00:29.097
TIANA:
Don't tell me he's putting her

00:29.130 --> 00:30.098
on my tour instead.
Who?

00:30.131 --> 00:31.599
Mirage รก Trois couldn't even

00:31.632 --> 00:33.000
fill up a coffeehouse.

00:33.033 --> 00:34.102
Jamal, are you
saying Lucious

00:34.135 --> 00:35.736
is inauthentic?

00:35.769 --> 00:37.571
I'm saying Lucious Lyon
ain't even his real name.

00:37.605 --> 00:38.739
(crowd gasps)

00:38.772 --> 00:40.341
Mimi is overprotective
and jealous,

00:40.374 --> 00:42.510
so I made a tape of
me and Camilla

00:42.543 --> 00:43.711
doing the nasty.

00:43.744 --> 00:45.045
It'd be a whole lot easier

00:45.079 --> 00:46.747
if you'd just take a swig

00:46.780 --> 00:48.082
of whatever that was
that you made

00:48.116 --> 00:50.184
Mimi drink.

00:50.218 --> 00:52.220
Rot in hell.

00:54.655 --> 00:57.091
(soulful choral music playing)

01:14.608 --> 01:17.478
Well, that battle-ax
did know fur.

01:28.189 --> 01:30.191
Oh...

01:39.333 --> 01:40.734
Empire has lost one of our

01:40.768 --> 01:43.471
very own--
Camilla Marks Whiteman.

01:43.504 --> 01:47.975
She was a beast in fashion
that we...

01:48.008 --> 01:50.811
that I was lucky to know.

01:50.844 --> 01:52.613
See, nobody really knows
what happened to her.

01:52.646 --> 01:54.114
What we do know

01:54.148 --> 01:56.116
is that she shouldn't be
remembered the way she died,

01:56.150 --> 01:58.118
because she was way
more than that.

01:58.152 --> 02:00.354
Antony and Cleopatra was
the last creative thing

02:00.388 --> 02:02.089
she did on this earth.

02:02.122 --> 02:04.625
Besides going out
like a carpet-munching

02:04.658 --> 02:05.826
Romeo and Juliet.
Mom.

02:05.859 --> 02:06.827
HAKEEM:
So we're gonna carry on

02:06.860 --> 02:08.095
with these designs and models

02:08.128 --> 02:10.931
you see here today
in Camilla's honor,

02:10.964 --> 02:13.801
with Rhonda Lyon as our
new Creative Director.

02:13.834 --> 02:16.670
We will carry on
with Camilla's legacy.

02:16.704 --> 02:18.839
Come on, y'all, we gonna
take Empire's fashion

02:18.872 --> 02:20.774
to a place where
it's never been before.

02:20.808 --> 02:22.943
WOMAN: That's right.
Make some noise for Antony

02:22.976 --> 02:25.012
and Cleopatra.

02:25.045 --> 02:26.614
I always hated
that dumb name.

02:26.647 --> 02:27.781
Come on, boy.

02:27.815 --> 02:29.850
(gentle classical music
playing)

02:29.883 --> 02:31.519
I'm sorry.

02:31.552 --> 02:32.520
For?

02:32.553 --> 02:34.988
Accusing you of cheating.

02:35.022 --> 02:36.357
Yeah... I wasn't
myself, baby.

02:36.390 --> 02:38.125
I know.

02:38.158 --> 02:40.994
I know that
that wasn't you,

02:41.028 --> 02:44.031
and I really appreciate
you seeing the doctor.

02:44.064 --> 02:47.000
This new medication
is working.

02:47.034 --> 02:48.035
Good.

02:51.372 --> 02:53.374
Good.

02:53.407 --> 02:55.709
You still want to move
out of the house?

02:55.743 --> 02:57.211
(Rhonda sighs)

02:57.245 --> 02:58.212
I know.

02:58.246 --> 02:59.880
I know it was a...

02:59.913 --> 03:02.583
incredibly generous
gift, I just...

03:05.519 --> 03:07.054
Let's just talk
about it later, okay?

03:07.087 --> 03:08.922
Okay.
Okay.

03:12.025 --> 03:15.095
(footsteps approaching)

03:16.930 --> 03:18.832
Now, ain't that cute.

03:18.866 --> 03:21.201
Thinking you just back
on top like that, huh?

03:21.235 --> 03:24.071
No, I was just keeping your seat
warm for you, son.

03:24.104 --> 03:26.240
All right, you mind?

03:26.274 --> 03:28.909
Actually, I wanted
to commend you on...

03:28.942 --> 03:31.078
getting rid of Camilla
like that.

03:31.111 --> 03:32.580
I didn't think you
had it in you, son.

03:32.613 --> 03:34.081
It wasn't supposed
to go down like that.

03:34.114 --> 03:35.916
Well, if you hadn't sent
that sex tape,

03:35.949 --> 03:37.718
we'd all still
be under that

03:37.751 --> 03:39.052
backstabbing bitch's
thumb today.

03:40.788 --> 03:42.089
Thank God you killed her.

03:42.122 --> 03:43.924
I didn't kill her!
COOKIE: Hey, hey!

03:43.957 --> 03:46.727
Enough of that dry snitching.

03:46.760 --> 03:48.696
Now, the State is
calling it a murder-

03:48.729 --> 03:50.264
suicide; that's what it is.

03:50.298 --> 03:53.100
Sure, Cookie.

03:53.133 --> 03:55.102
Lucious...

03:55.135 --> 03:56.937
you work on your video.

03:56.970 --> 03:59.473
You, Jamal, are working on
your Black & White album.

04:02.142 --> 04:03.110
Andre?

04:03.143 --> 04:04.712
You okay, baby?

04:04.745 --> 04:06.213
Yeah, I'm good.

04:06.246 --> 04:08.048
You're taking your
meds, aren't you?

04:08.081 --> 04:09.950
I'm fine, Mom.

04:09.983 --> 04:11.685
I'm on the mend.

04:13.987 --> 04:16.123
Okay.

04:16.156 --> 04:19.593
All right, no more fighting,
okay?

04:19.627 --> 04:21.962
To the world,
there's nothing to see here.

04:21.995 --> 04:24.665
No, I'm congratulating
our son on...

04:24.698 --> 04:26.934
actually earning this seat.

04:26.967 --> 04:29.803
Just always got to find a way
to just jab at your kids.

04:32.039 --> 04:33.006
As a matter of fact,

04:33.040 --> 04:34.007
when are y'all gonna

04:34.041 --> 04:35.142
stop being kids, anyway?

04:35.175 --> 04:37.277
I'm starting to think

04:37.311 --> 04:39.012
raising y'all around
all that money must have

04:39.046 --> 04:40.314
stunted your growth.

04:40.348 --> 04:41.982
Um, hello?

04:42.015 --> 04:43.283
Does anybody remember
what Sunday is?

04:43.317 --> 04:44.284
(Cookie chuckles)

04:44.318 --> 04:45.486
MEN:
It's your birthday.

04:47.154 --> 04:48.456
It's not just my birthday.

04:48.489 --> 04:50.190
It's the first birthday

04:50.223 --> 04:51.959
in 17 years

04:51.992 --> 04:53.861
that I get to
breathe free air,

04:53.894 --> 04:55.329
and I've been praying
for this day,

04:55.363 --> 04:56.830
and all I want is
some damn peace, okay?

04:56.864 --> 04:58.699
Can y'all just

04:58.732 --> 05:00.534
give me a nice
happy birthday dinner,

05:00.568 --> 05:02.202
no drama.
Think you can do that?

05:10.578 --> 05:12.580
*

05:18.318 --> 05:20.388
LUCIOUS: I gotta get out
to Philly more often.

05:20.421 --> 05:21.489
COOKIE:
For what?

05:21.522 --> 05:23.023
If not for your insisting

05:23.056 --> 05:24.558
on this location
for your video,

05:24.592 --> 05:26.860
we could be on a nice,
warm set.

05:26.894 --> 05:28.396
Oh! God...

05:34.535 --> 05:39.039
Wow, this is absolutely crazy.

05:39.072 --> 05:40.841
Out of all the houses
on this block,

05:40.874 --> 05:43.043
this is the only one
that ain't changed at all.

05:43.076 --> 05:45.245
I mean, even the stairs
are the same.

05:45.278 --> 05:46.714
It's like it was
saved just so

05:46.747 --> 05:49.383
I could shoot
this video here.

05:49.417 --> 05:51.184
Why here?

05:51.218 --> 05:52.386
Because it was right here,

05:52.420 --> 05:54.087
in front of that lion,

05:54.121 --> 05:56.089
that I slept the first
few nights when I ran away.

05:57.691 --> 05:59.593
(lion growling)

05:59.627 --> 06:02.062
LUCIOUS: And it was right there
that Dwight Walker

06:02.095 --> 06:03.296
became Lucious Lyon.

06:06.467 --> 06:08.936
How did you end up here?

06:10.103 --> 06:12.105
Where was your
mother, Lucious?

06:12.139 --> 06:13.741
Wherever she was, look,

06:13.774 --> 06:15.576
this ain't got nothing
to do with my mother.

06:15.609 --> 06:16.844
I mean, this is my story,

06:16.877 --> 06:18.679
and my story will
win me awards.

06:18.712 --> 06:19.947
Now, you know
this ain't got

06:19.980 --> 06:21.849
nothing to do with
no awards, Lucious.

06:21.882 --> 06:25.352
If you don't put your
whole truth into this video,

06:25.385 --> 06:28.055
what is the damn point?

06:34.294 --> 06:35.463
(sighs)

06:35.496 --> 06:36.930
* Bottoms up, bottoms up

06:36.964 --> 06:39.032
* Go on, get your bottoms up

06:39.066 --> 06:43.871
* All these bubbles in my head

06:43.904 --> 06:47.274
* Having breakfast
with Timothy *

06:47.307 --> 06:51.612
* At least I think that's
what he said *

06:51.645 --> 06:53.380
* Up all night,
have a sip with me *

06:53.413 --> 06:55.215
* Bottoms up, bottoms up

06:55.248 --> 06:56.450
* Go on, get your bottoms up

06:56.484 --> 06:58.151
* Bottoms up, bottoms up

06:58.185 --> 06:59.453
* Go on, get your bottoms up

06:59.487 --> 07:01.655
* Bottoms up, bottoms up

07:01.689 --> 07:03.657
* Go on, get your bottoms up

07:03.691 --> 07:05.793
* We sippin'
bottomless mimosa *

07:05.826 --> 07:07.461
* Pour me another dose-a

07:07.495 --> 07:09.463
* It's 10:00 a.m.,
we partying... *

07:09.497 --> 07:10.798
Now, this is the
third night in a row

07:10.831 --> 07:11.965
she's gone
over her time,

07:11.999 --> 07:13.300
and she's cutting
into my set.

07:13.333 --> 07:15.636
We'll talk to her.

07:15.669 --> 07:17.137
* Yeah, and I ain't even
been to bed *

07:17.170 --> 07:18.506
* Get to bed! *

07:18.539 --> 07:19.673
* Bottoms up, bottoms up

07:19.707 --> 07:22.009
* Go on, get your bottoms up!

Ready for Tiana!

07:26.614 --> 07:28.616

clapping rhythmically)

07:32.520 --> 07:35.155
Listen, I know this is your
first tour, little girl,

07:35.188 --> 07:36.990
so let me
explain to you.

07:37.024 --> 07:38.158
I'm the headliner.

07:38.191 --> 07:39.159
You're the help.

07:39.192 --> 07:40.327
You pull this in DC,

07:40.360 --> 07:41.995
I'm pulling the plug
on your mic.

07:42.029 --> 07:43.931
I was just trying to get them
fired up for you-- listen.

07:43.964 --> 07:45.766
You can't just
change the set list

07:45.799 --> 07:48.001
and go over your time
whenever you feel like it.

07:48.035 --> 07:49.837
That's not what
an opening act does

07:49.870 --> 07:51.505
to a headliner.

07:51.539 --> 07:53.073
("Look But Don't Touch"
intro begins)

07:55.543 --> 07:57.044
You and me need
to talk, okay?

07:59.412 --> 08:04.151
("All the Cash" by Evil Nine

Yeah, but we got
to at least try.

08:18.398 --> 08:19.633
I listened to her spit.

08:19.667 --> 08:21.034
She actually
is the truth.

Yeah, but truth is,

getting at Freda's
gonna tick Dad off.

08:23.737 --> 08:25.973

the gravy then.

to tuck those chains, boys.

How you doing?

That ain't him.
Yes, it is.

on her wall.

better than her.

09:01.441 --> 09:03.577
Yeah? Hit me with

* Let me tell you
something, yo *

09:29.069 --> 09:30.437
* I'm tired of practicing
gunfights, yo *

09:30.470 --> 09:31.605
* All day

09:31.639 --> 09:33.641
* I be praying
for some sunlight *

09:33.674 --> 09:35.809
* I hear the 3 Train West,
then I hear bullets *

09:35.843 --> 09:38.879
* A kid with a dream,
BK to the fullest. *

09:38.912 --> 09:40.781
(crowd cheering)

09:40.814 --> 09:42.783
(cheering, murmuring,
scattered applause)

09:42.816 --> 09:44.384
MAN:
Jamal! Do it, man!

09:44.417 --> 09:46.286
All right, all right,
hold up, hold up.

09:46.319 --> 09:49.089
* Oh, Father, Father,
can't you hear? *

09:49.122 --> 09:51.959
* Can you hear
your children crying? *

09:51.992 --> 09:54.327
* Can you see their tears?

09:54.361 --> 09:56.463
* Mm, yeah

09:56.496 --> 09:57.998
* The sun will always shine

09:58.031 --> 09:59.967
* Sun will always shine

10:00.000 --> 10:00.968
* Sun will always

10:01.001 --> 10:04.071
* Shine on me!

10:04.104 --> 10:05.105
Keem.

10:06.106 --> 10:07.908
* So even if it's crime

10:07.941 --> 10:09.977
* Sun will always shine...

10:10.010 --> 10:12.646
* Sun will always shine

10:12.680 --> 10:14.314
* On me

10:14.347 --> 10:15.515
* Keem, hey

10:15.548 --> 10:16.650
* Uh, it's the greatest

10:16.684 --> 10:18.451
* All I rock is the latest

10:18.485 --> 10:20.988
* Not Maino but find myself
saying hi to the haters *

10:21.021 --> 10:22.990
* Staying busy,
will never be a hiatus *

10:23.023 --> 10:24.257
* Turn your brains
into home fries *

10:24.291 --> 10:26.093
* When I peel your potatoes

10:26.126 --> 10:27.695
* Just 'cause I'm light-skinned
and curly-haired *

10:27.728 --> 10:28.862
* You think that I'm sweet

10:28.896 --> 10:30.664
* Like I won't run
in your mouth *

10:30.698 --> 10:32.766
* And have you
missing teeth, uh! *

10:32.800 --> 10:37.504
(crowd cheers)

10:37.537 --> 10:38.672
What's up, rich boy?

10:38.706 --> 10:40.307
Came back for a rematch?

10:40.340 --> 10:42.509
There you go. Nah, we came here
on some business.

10:42.542 --> 10:44.344
I ain't gonna take it easy
on you like I did last time.

10:44.377 --> 10:46.279
I'm actually the one
that wanted to talk to you.

10:46.313 --> 10:48.882
So, what you want?

10:48.916 --> 10:50.350
I think you kind of dope.

10:50.383 --> 10:51.351
I say that we should record
something together.

10:51.384 --> 10:52.853
(scoffs)

10:52.886 --> 10:54.554
So, y'all got beef
with Lucious, too?

10:54.587 --> 10:56.023
And y'all
came to try to

10:56.056 --> 10:57.524
steal me away?

10:57.557 --> 10:59.126
Not gonna happen.

10:59.159 --> 11:00.193
Lucious been like a father
to me-- you know that.

11:00.227 --> 11:02.195
And you think that's
a good thing?

11:02.229 --> 11:05.032
Freda, you do know
that he set that

11:05.065 --> 11:06.967
whole thing up with you and
Hakeem for his amusement, right?

11:07.000 --> 11:10.070
Just brace yourself for
when he abandons you, too.

11:10.103 --> 11:11.739
Look, he only like you
'cause you got him

11:11.772 --> 11:12.973
a ASA nomination.
Come on.

11:13.006 --> 11:14.207
Chill with all that.

11:14.241 --> 11:15.809
If Lucious did y'all dirty,

11:15.843 --> 11:17.077
that ain't got nothin'
to do with me.

11:18.611 --> 11:19.880
So, y'all have
a safe trip

11:19.913 --> 11:21.715
back to SoHo...

11:21.749 --> 11:23.083
and try not to get jacked.

11:31.591 --> 11:33.060
PORSHA:
Okay, they got German chocolate,

11:33.093 --> 11:34.227
vanilla butter cream,

11:34.261 --> 11:35.262
and lemon meringue pie.

11:35.295 --> 11:36.897
That's they specialty.

11:36.930 --> 11:38.398
Okay, when the hell
have you ever heard

11:38.431 --> 11:39.933
of a birthday pie, Porsha?

11:39.967 --> 11:41.334
My grandma used to make us

11:41.368 --> 11:42.669
a peach cobbler every year
for our birthday,

11:42.702 --> 11:43.837
and it was good, too.

11:43.871 --> 11:45.072
COOKIE: Just order
the cake, okay?

11:45.105 --> 11:46.439
PORSHA: Mm-hmm.
Enough for five.

11:46.473 --> 11:48.108
Thank you. Bye-bye.

11:50.710 --> 11:53.113
Lucious, you coming, right?

11:58.718 --> 12:01.188
Look, I think this
is her, right here.

12:01.221 --> 12:03.090
Look.

12:03.123 --> 12:05.793
No, the face is wrong.

12:07.060 --> 12:08.796
My mama's face
was beautiful,

12:08.829 --> 12:11.598
like her voice.

12:11.631 --> 12:12.933
You never
told me that.

12:12.966 --> 12:15.435
LEAH:
* The itsy-bitsy spider

12:15.468 --> 12:19.206
* Went up the waterspout

12:19.239 --> 12:20.740
* Down came the rain

12:20.774 --> 12:22.042
COOKIE: Lucious! Lucious!

12:22.075 --> 12:23.043
* And washed the spider out...

12:23.076 --> 12:24.778
Lucious, Lucious,
look, look.

12:24.812 --> 12:25.779
Her.

12:25.813 --> 12:27.915
No.

12:27.948 --> 12:30.617
No, Cookie, why don't you just
pick somebody for me, all right?

12:30.650 --> 12:32.786
Look, I'm...

12:32.820 --> 12:34.121
I'm-a need a minute.

12:35.823 --> 12:37.791
I pick her.

12:37.825 --> 12:39.226
Yes, I think this...

12:39.259 --> 12:41.161
(medium tempo intro
to "Shine on Me" playing)

12:42.662 --> 12:45.966
* Oh, it's merciless,
the grind *

12:45.999 --> 12:48.335
* Sometimes we turn to crime

12:48.368 --> 12:52.172
* But the sun will
always shine, yeah *

12:54.007 --> 12:56.343
* It's merciless, the grind

12:56.376 --> 12:59.146
* Sometimes we turn to crime

12:59.179 --> 13:01.314
* But the sun will
always shine *

13:01.348 --> 13:02.315
* Yeah

13:02.349 --> 13:03.750
* Ooh, ooh *

13:03.783 --> 13:07.287
* Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

13:07.320 --> 13:09.823
* Ooh-ooh,
ooh-ooh, ooh... *

13:09.857 --> 13:11.825
Look, it's too repetitive
after the first hook.

13:11.859 --> 13:13.126
Man, I get it.

13:13.160 --> 13:14.327
It's just that
that's where I was hoping

13:14.361 --> 13:15.328
that Freda's verse would go.

13:15.362 --> 13:17.130
Ship's sailed, bro, move on.

13:17.164 --> 13:19.332
A'ight.
Yo.

13:19.366 --> 13:20.667
(Hakeem laughs)

13:20.700 --> 13:22.936
I heard about your
weekend, freak nasty.

13:22.970 --> 13:24.771
That is none of your business,
but this...

13:24.804 --> 13:27.440
this is bad, okay?

13:27.474 --> 13:28.842
This is Keyshia Cole
vs. Black Twitter bad.

13:28.876 --> 13:30.010
You see what
your brother did?

13:30.043 --> 13:31.879
You see? His ex,
Tiana, is threatening

13:31.912 --> 13:34.714
to leave the tour because
of his new bae.

13:34.747 --> 13:36.349
This is real bad for a CEO

13:36.383 --> 13:38.518
who's only been in charge
for five minutes.

13:38.551 --> 13:41.354
And it's not good for a CEO to
be banging his artists, Hakeem.

13:41.388 --> 13:44.191
Then what's the point
of being a mogul, then?

13:44.224 --> 13:45.658
All right, then,
I'm-a shoot down to DC

13:45.692 --> 13:46.960
and work this out.

13:46.994 --> 13:48.528
I got this.

13:48.561 --> 13:50.463
JAMAL:
* Murder on my...

13:50.497 --> 13:53.466
* Death on my block

13:53.500 --> 13:54.968
* Cops...

13:55.002 --> 13:57.370
* Be more criminal than cop...

13:58.738 --> 14:00.707
COOKIE (sighing):
Okay, so, Jamal,

14:00.740 --> 14:02.575
I think I got everything
I need for Sunday.

14:02.609 --> 14:04.211
I ordered eight pounds
of shrimp.

14:04.244 --> 14:05.913
I got my champagne.

14:05.946 --> 14:08.048
My peonies...
PORSHA: Wait.

14:08.081 --> 14:09.950
Peonies, I thought you said--
you mean pennies?

14:11.418 --> 14:14.554
Porsha, why in the hell would
I need six dozen pennies?

14:14.587 --> 14:15.855
My grandma used to put nickels
in a handkerchief,

14:15.889 --> 14:17.057
fold them up in a rubber band...

14:17.090 --> 14:18.558
COOKIE:
Buh-buh, buh-buh, buh!

14:18.591 --> 14:19.993
Can you and
your country-ass

14:20.027 --> 14:22.095
traditions give us
a minute, please?

14:26.934 --> 14:28.268
Jamal...

14:28.301 --> 14:30.737
did your father ever
tell you anything

14:30.770 --> 14:31.771
about your grandmother?

14:31.804 --> 14:34.107
How she was when
he was a little boy?

14:34.141 --> 14:36.343
Why would he tell me that?

14:36.376 --> 14:40.780
Well, I mean, you're the one
knew his real name

14:40.813 --> 14:42.215
before any of us,
so I figured

14:42.249 --> 14:43.283
you might know
something about that.

14:43.316 --> 14:44.684
You producing
his video, huh?

14:44.717 --> 14:46.419
Yes, because
I'm the head of A&R.

14:46.453 --> 14:48.121
It's my job.

14:48.155 --> 14:51.424
I mean, I wish that
he would have, but he didn't.

14:51.458 --> 14:52.692
Whatever it was,

14:52.725 --> 14:53.994
it certainly
wasn't happy stuff.

14:56.296 --> 14:59.266
Are you mad because
I'm producing his video?

14:59.299 --> 15:00.733
Come on, Jamal,

15:00.767 --> 15:01.935
I know you're upset
with your father,

15:01.969 --> 15:03.736
but, I mean, you know,

15:03.770 --> 15:05.205
(laughing):
we all got a job
to do around here.

15:05.238 --> 15:06.406
Mom, seriously,

15:06.439 --> 15:08.942
I'm not upset
with anybody, it's...

15:08.976 --> 15:10.610
you're doing your job,
like you said.

15:10.643 --> 15:11.744
You coming to my party?

15:11.778 --> 15:12.779
JAMAL:
I mean...

15:15.282 --> 15:17.117
HAKEEM: Just tell me what I need
to do to make this work.

15:17.150 --> 15:18.751
Tell your girl
to fall back.

15:18.785 --> 15:20.220
This ain't her show.

15:20.253 --> 15:22.389
And tell her ass to stay out
of my wardrobe.

15:22.422 --> 15:23.890
Who does that?

15:23.923 --> 15:26.759
Look, she was right
about the clothes, okay?

15:26.793 --> 15:28.795
But girls be weird
about that type of stuff.

15:28.828 --> 15:31.064
Fine, but she needs to stop
cutting off the fan lines

15:31.098 --> 15:32.799
before I even make it
out of my dressing room.

15:32.832 --> 15:34.634
And she needs to hustle
when the show is over

15:34.667 --> 15:36.803
and quit cutting into my set.

15:36.836 --> 15:39.806
Look, nobody gave me special
treatment when we were dating.

15:39.839 --> 15:42.075
We always kept
it professional.

15:42.109 --> 15:44.111
In smaller cities
there's no harm in letting

15:44.144 --> 15:45.478
her spread her wings a little.

15:45.512 --> 15:47.080
Is there?

15:47.114 --> 15:49.082
It don't take no shine
off of you.

15:49.116 --> 15:50.450
Look, that's one
extra song a night,

15:50.483 --> 15:51.818
but that's only
in smaller cities.

15:51.851 --> 15:53.153
Really?

15:53.186 --> 15:54.921
What, you ain't think
I got your back?

15:54.954 --> 15:56.123
You gonna be a star, baby.

16:17.910 --> 16:21.014
Look, you love her,

16:21.048 --> 16:22.349
but you're just
scared of her.

16:22.382 --> 16:24.184
She's still
your mother.

16:24.217 --> 16:26.119
What's all this, though?
And that's the...
that, it's...

16:26.153 --> 16:27.520
Y'all hold on,
hold on one second.
It's a dichotomy.

16:27.554 --> 16:29.022
It's strange.

16:29.056 --> 16:30.690
Hey, Lucious,
what's all this mess?

16:31.724 --> 16:34.627
Baby, this is
my life, this mess.

16:34.661 --> 16:38.231
So, what happened to all the
dungeons and dragons and stuff?

16:38.265 --> 16:39.966
(sighs)

16:39.999 --> 16:42.202
Hey, um, talk to him for--
give me a second.

16:42.235 --> 16:43.970
MAN: Hey, buddy.
Okay, so we're gonna...

16:44.003 --> 16:46.073
I went in a whole different
direction with the video.

16:46.106 --> 16:47.074
(Lucious chuckles)

16:47.107 --> 16:48.908
Okay, so, I guess I could

16:48.941 --> 16:50.143
just leave on what
I got on, then.

16:50.177 --> 16:52.512
No, I mean, we...

16:52.545 --> 16:54.181
we took your verse
out of the song.

16:54.214 --> 16:55.882
H-How would you cut me out
and I wrote half

16:55.915 --> 16:57.850
of this song?
(sighs)

16:57.884 --> 17:00.053
Look...

17:00.087 --> 17:01.654
I gotta go in
a different direction.

17:01.688 --> 17:03.390
I'm-a call you, we'll sit down

17:03.423 --> 17:05.892
and have some lunch
and talk about it next week.

17:05.925 --> 17:07.094
Freda...

17:07.127 --> 17:09.829
("Shine on Me" fading in)

17:09.862 --> 17:12.932
* Oh, Father, Father,
can't you hear? *

17:12.965 --> 17:15.835
* Can you hear
your children crying? *

17:15.868 --> 17:18.171
* Can you see their tears?

17:18.205 --> 17:19.906
* Mm, yeah

17:19.939 --> 17:23.943
* To feed the ones
you hold so dear *

17:30.383 --> 17:32.185
* Look at me,
really look at me *

* Heart of a champion

17:33.653 --> 17:35.155
* Eyes that h...

(music track clicks off)

17:40.960 --> 17:43.029
(laughs)

17:43.062 --> 17:44.030
Damn.

17:44.063 --> 17:45.031
Yo, even when you know

17:45.064 --> 17:46.199
you dealing with the devil,

17:46.233 --> 17:48.368
it still hurts.

17:48.401 --> 17:51.271
Yeah, but Pops was a bastard,
though, you feel me?

17:51.304 --> 17:52.905
Mm-hmm.
So, when I met Lucious,

17:52.939 --> 17:54.607
it was like, you know,

17:54.641 --> 17:56.609
I thought I had met a man
I could count on.

17:56.643 --> 17:59.146
My pop's got me running
towards his love one minute

17:59.179 --> 18:00.613
and running from the hate
the next, so...

18:00.647 --> 18:03.283
And mine's got, like,
this hold on me,

18:03.316 --> 18:06.653
even though he's dead,
and it's like these chains.

18:06.686 --> 18:09.756
No matter how hard
I try to break free, like,

18:09.789 --> 18:11.291
I cannot escape it.

18:11.324 --> 18:12.925
What if we can, though,
you know?

18:14.661 --> 18:16.329
Hold up, hold up.
Play it from, um,

18:16.363 --> 18:17.964
where we left off,
but in the speaker.

18:17.997 --> 18:20.567
(over speaker): * Look at me,
really look at me *

18:20.600 --> 18:21.968
Yeah...
* Heart of a champion

18:22.001 --> 18:23.803
* Eyes that have seen

18:23.836 --> 18:25.138
* Murder on my street,
death on my block *

18:25.172 --> 18:26.306
* Cops that be more

18:26.339 --> 18:28.141
* Criminal than cop

18:28.175 --> 18:29.342
* Daddy, a kingpin

18:29.376 --> 18:30.410
* Mama, a hustler

18:30.443 --> 18:31.978
* What am I gon' be?

18:32.011 --> 18:33.313
* Who is it up to?

18:33.346 --> 18:35.315
* Me, and just me,
doing it my way... *

18:35.348 --> 18:36.749
I like that.
It's dope.

18:36.783 --> 18:37.750
* Hey!

18:37.784 --> 18:40.287
* Sun will always shine

18:40.320 --> 18:42.155
* Sun will
always shine *

18:42.189 --> 18:44.424
* Sun will always shine

18:44.457 --> 18:45.592
(music track continues playing)

18:45.625 --> 18:47.026
You tell me about
these chains you got

18:47.059 --> 18:48.094
and how we gonna break them.

18:48.127 --> 18:50.163
What you got? Come on.

18:50.197 --> 18:51.698
Give me some bars.

18:52.965 --> 18:54.267
Keep it going.

18:54.301 --> 18:58.171
*

18:58.205 --> 19:01.040
* I say one shot, two shot,
three shot, four *

19:01.073 --> 19:03.510
* Daddy, I can't take no more

19:03.543 --> 19:04.677
* I'm sick of watching
windows *

19:04.711 --> 19:06.045
* 'Fore I walk out the door

19:06.078 --> 19:07.847
* I know that's not
what I'm here for *

19:07.880 --> 19:08.848
* It's a brighter day

19:08.881 --> 19:10.183
* The impact, I did that

19:10.217 --> 19:12.118
* I'm-a take this and sit back

19:12.151 --> 19:14.354
* And watch the chips stack,
you dig that? *

19:14.387 --> 19:15.522
* We started from the bottom

19:15.555 --> 19:16.856
(music track slows, pauses)

19:16.889 --> 19:18.858
* You gotta know the sun
is always shining *

19:18.891 --> 19:20.193
(music track kicks in)
* The sun will always shine

19:20.227 --> 19:22.195
* Shine *
* Sun will always shine

19:22.229 --> 19:23.663
* Shine... *
* Sun will always

19:23.696 --> 19:25.565
* Shine

19:25.598 --> 19:26.633
* On me

19:26.666 --> 19:27.634
* Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh *

19:27.667 --> 19:30.370
* Mm... so even if it's crime

19:30.403 --> 19:32.372
* Crime *
* I'm taking care of mine

19:32.405 --> 19:33.906
* Ooh... *
* So the sun will always

19:33.940 --> 19:35.542
* Shine...

19:35.575 --> 19:36.743
* On me

19:36.776 --> 19:39.145
* Shine on me!

19:39.178 --> 19:42.582
Okay, now I thought I asked
for green walls in that thing.

19:42.615 --> 19:43.816
I don't know
if any of y'all...

19:43.850 --> 19:44.884
You changed the
concept of your video

19:44.917 --> 19:46.686
ten days before
the ASA awards open.

19:46.719 --> 19:48.054
You don't think
that's a little risky?

19:48.087 --> 19:50.089
No, not with
my secret weapon.

19:50.122 --> 19:51.258
Lucious, you ready, baby?

19:51.291 --> 19:53.092
Hey, look, uh,
Cookie, this is

19:53.125 --> 19:54.261
Harper Scott.
Harper Scott.

19:54.294 --> 19:55.562
Hey, Cookie.

19:55.595 --> 19:57.163
Oh, yes, I remember
Miss Thing.

19:57.196 --> 19:58.998
She was throwing shade
at the conference.

19:59.031 --> 20:00.700
What you doing here?

20:00.733 --> 20:02.402
I'll be shadowing Lucious
for the next few weeks.

20:02.435 --> 20:04.103
Oh, I didn't know vampires

20:04.136 --> 20:05.104
had shadows.

20:05.137 --> 20:06.105
Uh-huh, you be careful,
Cookie.

20:06.138 --> 20:08.074
(laughs)
So, you like it?

20:08.107 --> 20:09.108
Huh?
Ooh.

20:12.945 --> 20:15.415
LEAH:
Dwight, baby, did you really
think I'd forget your birthday?

20:15.448 --> 20:17.350
DWIGHT:
But my birthday's not
till next month.

20:17.384 --> 20:19.919
LEAH:
We're gonna celebrate it now.

20:19.952 --> 20:21.087
Look at all this stuff.

20:21.120 --> 20:22.221
(Leah laughs)

20:25.625 --> 20:27.760
Uh, Lucious?

20:27.794 --> 20:29.296
Lucious!

20:29.329 --> 20:30.863
Something's wrong
about this scene.

20:30.897 --> 20:32.865
No, it's real-- the only
thing is, I asked for

20:32.899 --> 20:33.933
project green paint!

20:33.966 --> 20:35.468
No, no, no,
it should be outside.

20:35.502 --> 20:37.103
It's like...
Lucious...

20:37.136 --> 20:38.438
please don't do this to me.

20:38.471 --> 20:40.139
Okay, we're here
to tell your truth.

20:40.172 --> 20:42.609
No, that's what I'm talking
about-- my truth is not this.

20:42.642 --> 20:44.777
I mean, I made it this far
without having a damn
ASA award...

20:44.811 --> 20:46.078
All right, you know what,
everybody take ten!

20:46.112 --> 20:48.415
We'll be right back!

20:48.448 --> 20:50.249
MAN: All right, everybody!
Don't you write that;
I'll beat your ass.

20:50.283 --> 20:52.585
Okay, nothing to see here,
people, we'll be right back!

20:52.619 --> 20:54.321
You know what I'm saying?
COOKIE:
Yeah, no, I do understand...

21:00.427 --> 21:02.228
This way, Mom.

21:02.261 --> 21:04.697
Baby!
We are so proud of you.

21:06.633 --> 21:09.402
Thank you for believing in our
little girl as much as we do.

21:09.436 --> 21:10.403
Tom, that's not a problem.

21:10.437 --> 21:11.471
She sings like an angel.

21:11.504 --> 21:13.306
Well, she got it
from her father.

21:13.340 --> 21:15.475
What? You got pipes,
Mr. Calleros?

21:15.508 --> 21:17.310
Back in the day,
I did my thing a little...

21:17.344 --> 21:18.811
A little?
some-some.

21:18.845 --> 21:19.979
"Unda'ground Lunatics"
was famous.

21:20.012 --> 21:22.782
Not famous like
Laura's going to be.

21:22.815 --> 21:24.150
And there's nothing
better for a father

21:24.183 --> 21:25.151
than when his child
shines brighter

21:25.184 --> 21:27.854
than he ever did.

21:30.857 --> 21:32.825
What?

21:32.859 --> 21:34.694
Are you okay?

21:34.727 --> 21:38.498
Just my family ain't like that.

21:38.531 --> 21:40.667
It's nice, though.

21:40.700 --> 21:44.671
Well, I'm sure your
father feels that way.

21:44.704 --> 21:48.174
He probably just doesn't
know how to say it.

21:48.207 --> 21:50.042
COOKIE:
You told me she dunked
you in the water.

21:50.076 --> 21:53.045
What else
did she do to you?

21:58.084 --> 22:01.187
Tell me, Lucious.

22:04.557 --> 22:05.692
Get in that tub!

22:05.725 --> 22:06.793
Get in that water!

22:06.826 --> 22:09.729
Mommy! Mommy, please!
No!

22:09.762 --> 22:11.431
LUCIOUS: She said we needed
to be cleansed.

22:16.369 --> 22:18.438
That's why she held me
under the water so long.

22:22.509 --> 22:24.343
But by the time she
snapped out of it

22:24.377 --> 22:26.012
and realized what
she was doing,

22:26.045 --> 22:28.515
she was horrified, so...

22:30.717 --> 22:32.519
Later that day, she...

22:35.254 --> 22:38.090
Dwight, do you know what
Mommy did with her books?

22:38.124 --> 22:40.493
(sighs quietly)

22:40.527 --> 22:41.894
...got her gun and...

22:46.966 --> 22:48.134
...put it to her head...

22:51.270 --> 22:52.238
(distant gunshot booms)

22:52.271 --> 22:53.840
Pulled the trigger.

22:53.873 --> 22:54.841
(Cookie gasps)

22:54.874 --> 22:56.609
(shuddering exhale)

22:56.643 --> 22:58.277
Right in front of you?

22:59.979 --> 23:01.213
You saw it?

23:07.787 --> 23:09.288
Who took care of you?

23:15.495 --> 23:18.264
This neighbor lady next-door,

23:18.297 --> 23:20.266
named Miss Pat.

23:20.299 --> 23:23.770
They said that
Social Services was coming,

23:23.803 --> 23:25.905
and I didn't know who
the hell they were,

23:25.938 --> 23:29.609
but I knew I didn't want to be
with them, so I absconded.

23:30.843 --> 23:34.113
Slept in the streets,
in abandoned buildings.

23:34.146 --> 23:37.550
I used to call them
"bandominiums."

23:37.584 --> 23:40.953
Ate out of trash cans
for about six months,

23:40.987 --> 23:43.756
and then, one day,
I bumped into this dude.

23:43.790 --> 23:45.792
He was like 16.

23:45.825 --> 23:50.129
He gave me my first bag to sell.

23:50.162 --> 23:51.831
Name was Frank Gathers.

23:54.100 --> 23:57.069
Lucious, Frank Gathers
turned you on to hustling?

23:57.103 --> 23:58.605
Saved my life.

24:09.616 --> 24:11.117
We did what we had to do.

24:11.150 --> 24:13.285
You're damn right.

24:13.319 --> 24:15.321
'Cause he would've
killed you twice.

24:15.354 --> 24:17.624
(wry laugh)
Forget about him.

24:17.657 --> 24:19.626
(sighing):
Look...

24:19.659 --> 24:21.928
Lucious...

24:21.961 --> 24:23.496
you gotta tell the truth.

24:23.530 --> 24:25.131
You gotta tell
your whole story.

24:25.164 --> 24:26.833
Yeah, you do.

24:26.866 --> 24:29.135
You need to show what
happened to your mother,

24:29.168 --> 24:31.470
what she did
to herself-- yes--

24:31.504 --> 24:33.405
and what she did to you.

24:36.175 --> 24:37.710
Why?

24:40.547 --> 24:42.682
Because I did 17 years

24:42.715 --> 24:46.218
for a man whose real name
I didn't even know.

24:59.431 --> 25:00.399
LUCIOUS:
All right... (sighs)

25:00.432 --> 25:01.433
it's gonna feel like, um...

25:03.570 --> 25:05.204
...like she's trying
to hurt you,

25:05.237 --> 25:07.406
but she's not.

25:07.439 --> 25:09.709
She's, uh...

25:17.116 --> 25:20.386
She doesn't know
what she's doing.

25:20.419 --> 25:21.921
Just-just do it the
way we practiced it.

25:21.954 --> 25:23.756
All right, places, everybody.

25:26.726 --> 25:28.060

26:38.665 --> 26:40.499
You're being so brave

26:40.532 --> 26:43.970

a hero for a lot of people.

26:44.003 --> 26:45.838
You like that, don't you?
Look at that smile.

26:45.872 --> 26:47.473
Big boy.

What up, what up, what up?

28:36.648 --> 28:37.950
(crowd cheering wildly)

28:37.984 --> 28:40.753
Look, I just want to say
thank y'all for supporting

28:40.787 --> 28:42.621
Tiana and Laura, but I got
one question for y'all.

28:42.654 --> 28:43.756
VARIOUS FANS:
What?

28:43.790 --> 28:46.292
Y'all ready for some new work?

28:46.325 --> 28:47.860
(audience cheers)

28:47.894 --> 28:50.496
("All Nite" intro playing)

28:58.137 --> 28:59.538
* Bust that ass,
let me see you move *

28:59.571 --> 29:01.908
(Tiana vocalizing)
* Baby

29:01.941 --> 29:04.310
* Bust that ass,

29:04.343 --> 29:07.814

29:07.847 --> 29:09.949

29:09.982 --> 29:12.118

* What? They doing this?
Man, I did last year *

29:36.008 --> 29:38.444
* Hit the charts number one,
that was just the first year *

29:38.477 --> 29:40.746
* All they really want to know

29:40.779 --> 29:43.015
* I'm-a, I'm-a need a hundred

29:50.522 --> 29:52.624

* All my people in the building,

29:55.227 --> 29:57.830

* All nite...

30:16.048 --> 30:18.050
*

30:18.084 --> 30:20.452
(song slowly fades out)

30:20.486 --> 30:24.690
You're gonna have a rough
for me by 5:00 today, right?

30:24.723 --> 30:25.892
Come on, please?

30:25.925 --> 30:27.026
I'm not getting anything
else I want.

30:27.059 --> 30:28.494
It's my birthday.
Hey, Mom.

30:28.527 --> 30:29.728
Hey!

30:29.761 --> 30:32.064
Happy birthday.
(laughs)

30:32.098 --> 30:33.532
Thanks. Beautiful.

30:33.565 --> 30:35.367
Sit down.
So, look,

30:35.401 --> 30:38.570
I was thinking tomorrow,
I'm-a take you shopping.

30:38.604 --> 30:40.072
We gonna go
to the movies.

30:40.106 --> 30:42.341
I'm going to take you to that
rib spot on 125th Street.

30:42.374 --> 30:44.210
Yeah, and you doing all this

30:44.243 --> 30:45.544
because you not
coming tonight?

30:51.583 --> 30:56.222
Look, Jamal, I know you
can't stand the man...

30:56.255 --> 30:58.224
but maybe after
you see this video,

30:58.257 --> 31:01.827
you'll understand him
a little better.

31:01.860 --> 31:03.429
Remember how loyal
I was to him?

31:03.462 --> 31:05.231
Even if it meant
having beef with you.

31:05.264 --> 31:06.398
I know.

31:06.432 --> 31:09.401
And then he sabotages me
and... for what?

31:09.435 --> 31:11.570
An award. So I'm good.

31:11.603 --> 31:14.273
Both of y'all are my family,
and I just think

31:14.306 --> 31:16.909
that it is really unfair
that I'm being forced

31:16.943 --> 31:18.610
to choose who to work with.

31:18.644 --> 31:20.612
I'm not forcing you
to choose anything.

31:20.646 --> 31:22.881
You gotta do this
right now, I get it.

31:22.915 --> 31:25.084
So, I'm-a work
with Hakeem right now

31:25.117 --> 31:26.618
on the Black & White
album and...

31:26.652 --> 31:28.420
Okay, so now you're
firing me as your producer.

31:28.454 --> 31:30.089
No.

31:30.122 --> 31:32.424
And you're not coming
to my birthday party.

31:32.458 --> 31:36.128
Fine, I'll just have a
quiet dinner with Lucious.

31:37.663 --> 31:38.630
Ugh.

31:38.664 --> 31:40.066
Ugh, what?

31:40.099 --> 31:41.600
You're falling for him, again.

31:41.633 --> 31:43.435
(scoffs)

31:43.469 --> 31:45.571
Boy, you don't understand.

31:45.604 --> 31:49.976
What me and your father got
is very deep,

31:50.009 --> 31:51.978
and you just don't throw
all of that away

31:52.011 --> 31:55.147
just because of a few
misunderstandings.

31:55.181 --> 31:56.782
It's more than a few.

31:56.815 --> 31:57.916
(wry chuckle)

31:59.818 --> 32:02.321
But I get it, Mom,
just be careful, okay?
Mm-hmm.

32:02.354 --> 32:03.755
I love you.
Right.

32:03.789 --> 32:06.325
Happy birthday.
Yeah.

32:11.630 --> 32:12.631
Stupid flowers.

32:18.170 --> 32:19.471
(insistent knocking at door)

32:19.505 --> 32:20.806
Coming!

32:20.839 --> 32:21.940
(door opens)

32:21.974 --> 32:24.043
I was going to open
the door for you.

32:26.845 --> 32:30.016
COOKIE:
Happy birthday to me.

32:30.049 --> 32:32.851
I see somebody had fun
building a bear.

32:32.884 --> 32:36.655
Well, is that suit supposed
to be a distraction

32:36.688 --> 32:38.157
to the fact that this is one

32:38.190 --> 32:40.692
sad, sorry
birthday dinner for two?

32:40.726 --> 32:43.095
No, the teddy bear is.
(chuckles)

32:43.129 --> 32:47.333
All I wanted was a happy
birthday dinner with my family.

32:47.366 --> 32:50.669
Can't do that because you
managed to piss off all my sons.

32:50.702 --> 32:52.338
Thank you, Lucious.

32:52.371 --> 32:55.341
Let's just sit down, eat this
food and get some work done.

32:55.374 --> 32:57.276
Hit it!

32:57.309 --> 32:59.711
(jazzy piano intro playing)

33:05.151 --> 33:07.853
So you want me to think that
that's Stevie Wonder over there.

33:07.886 --> 33:09.555
No.
Huh?

33:12.391 --> 33:15.027
* Happy birthday to ya

33:15.061 --> 33:18.030
* Happy birthday
to ya *

33:18.064 --> 33:21.133
* Happy birthday

33:21.167 --> 33:23.035
* Happy birthday to ya

33:23.069 --> 33:26.972
* Happy birthday
to ya *

33:27.005 --> 33:28.174
* Happy birthday...

33:28.207 --> 33:30.142
How did you manage
to pull this off?

33:30.176 --> 33:33.379
Well, apparently, they love you
more than they hate me, so...

33:33.412 --> 33:34.580
Well...
(Lucious chuckles)

33:34.613 --> 33:36.182
Thank you.

33:37.183 --> 33:38.984
LUCIOUS:
Happy birthday, Cookie Monster.

33:39.017 --> 33:40.219
Thank you.

33:44.256 --> 33:47.059
I am so glad you changed
your mind and came.

33:47.093 --> 33:48.194
I didn't change my mind.

33:48.227 --> 33:49.561
All the birthdays I missed,

33:49.595 --> 33:51.063
you think I'm gonna
miss this one, too?

33:51.097 --> 33:52.564
Even if you are sprung
on that man.

33:52.598 --> 33:53.565
What? Ain't nobod...

33:53.599 --> 33:55.434
Ain't nobody sprung out.

33:55.467 --> 33:56.935
Would you shut up?

33:56.968 --> 33:58.604
Okay, y'all, I have something
I want to show you,

33:58.637 --> 34:00.572
so come on in here.

34:00.606 --> 34:02.274
LUCIOUS: That's the best part
about this day.
Come on.

34:03.542 --> 34:05.344
Come on in, y'all.

34:05.377 --> 34:07.746
Now, your father and I

34:07.779 --> 34:09.248
have been working
on his music video.

34:09.281 --> 34:11.049
Uh, I spent all day

34:11.083 --> 34:13.252
trying to put
together a rough cut.

34:13.285 --> 34:14.520
It's not perfect.
No, no, no, no, no.

34:14.553 --> 34:16.088
Cookie, it's not ready yet.

34:16.122 --> 34:18.056
Yeah, it is.
Lucious, sit down.

34:21.493 --> 34:23.629
* Boom boom boom boom

34:23.662 --> 34:26.031
* Bang bang bang bang

34:26.064 --> 34:27.133
* From the bottom I got up

34:27.166 --> 34:28.567
* To the top of the pros

34:28.600 --> 34:29.601
* From the gutter
to the shutter *

34:29.635 --> 34:30.636
* Trimmed out in gold

34:30.669 --> 34:31.770
* Life bless my soul

34:31.803 --> 34:32.938
* God bless my mo

34:32.971 --> 34:34.106
* Nothing less than the best

34:34.140 --> 34:35.441
* So the rest is old

34:35.474 --> 34:36.975
* Don't wanna play chess

34:37.008 --> 34:38.144
* Wanna lock and load

34:38.177 --> 34:39.245
* Wanna tag some toes

34:39.278 --> 34:40.612
* Wanna send ya home

34:40.646 --> 34:43.782
* It ain't about the pain

34:43.815 --> 34:45.784
* Tell 'em what's my name

34:45.817 --> 34:46.952
* Boom boom boom boom

34:46.985 --> 34:48.987
* Bang bang bang bang

34:49.020 --> 34:52.958
* And you don't wanna...
* Boom boom boom boom

34:52.991 --> 34:54.993
* Bang bang bang bang

34:55.026 --> 34:56.995
* I told the new jack to set,
kid, watch and learn *

34:57.028 --> 34:59.965
* No, wait, not yet,
baby, now's your turn *

34:59.998 --> 35:02.501
* In the center there's a vet
that's committed to murder *

35:02.534 --> 35:04.836
* Ain't concerned 'cause
he's already burned *

35:04.870 --> 35:07.005
* Round the corner, round the
back, mad skills were sealed *

35:07.038 --> 35:09.775
* Round the way, matter of fact,
he tried to steal *

35:09.808 --> 35:12.344
* Don't lay on your back,
'cause it turns me on *

35:12.378 --> 35:14.480
* Ground control to Major Tom

35:14.513 --> 35:16.948
* He was over there talking
all kinds of tough *

35:16.982 --> 35:19.985
* While you're sipping on your
little bitty pick-me-up *

35:20.018 --> 35:21.820
* Well, you say you like
to play a little fisticuffs *

35:21.853 --> 35:22.988
* But when the whistle puffs

35:23.021 --> 35:24.490
* I'm going to call your bluff

35:24.523 --> 35:26.858
(gunshot)
* Boom boom boom boom

35:26.892 --> 35:28.494
* Bang bang bang bang

35:28.527 --> 35:29.661
* Hey, check on...

35:29.695 --> 35:31.697
Uh, Andre?

35:31.730 --> 35:32.998
What are you doing?

35:42.241 --> 35:43.909
Was my grandmother bipolar?

35:46.678 --> 35:48.214
I don't know, I ain't no doctor.

35:48.247 --> 35:50.482
Yeah, but everything
in this video...

35:50.516 --> 35:52.184
It really happened?

35:52.218 --> 35:53.885
She really shot herself?

35:57.223 --> 35:59.525
Answer me.

36:02.394 --> 36:05.331
Look, um, back then,
we didn't have a name for it.

36:05.364 --> 36:08.300
But I guess, yeah,
you can say she was bipolar.

36:08.334 --> 36:11.102
What?
RHONDA: Wow.
Dad, really?

36:12.338 --> 36:13.905
You knew.

36:15.241 --> 36:16.208
This whole time
you-you knew.

36:16.242 --> 36:17.343
Andre...

36:17.376 --> 36:18.677
You made me feel
like I was some...

36:18.710 --> 36:21.046
some freak you didn't even
recognize my whole life.

36:21.079 --> 36:24.816
I don't know how knowing that
my mother put a gun to her head,

36:24.850 --> 36:25.851
how that would've
helped you.

36:25.884 --> 36:27.085
No, it wouldn't
have helped you,

36:27.118 --> 36:28.186
but it damn sure
would've helped me, Pop.

36:28.220 --> 36:30.055
It would have helped me!

36:30.088 --> 36:31.156
No, it would have weakened you.

36:31.189 --> 36:32.724
I wanted to make
you strong, son.

36:32.758 --> 36:34.092
Damn liar, get
the hell off me.

36:34.125 --> 36:35.093
You're a damn liar.
I'm a liar?

36:35.126 --> 36:36.595
A damn liar!

36:36.628 --> 36:37.763
Okay, you want
to know the truth?

36:37.796 --> 36:39.898
The truth is,
you got mental issues.

36:39.931 --> 36:42.167
The truth is, I sent you
to all them damn schools,

36:42.200 --> 36:45.404
thinking that maybe that was
going to help you some way.

36:45.437 --> 36:47.239
Truth is,
I-I let you marry Rhonda,
You let me marry her.

36:47.273 --> 36:50.909
Thinking that maybe that would
give you some sense of identity.

36:50.942 --> 36:53.445
But the real truth is,
my mother was a nut-job.

36:53.479 --> 36:56.047
I was embarrassed by her.

36:56.081 --> 36:57.916
The same way
I'm embarrassed by you.

36:57.949 --> 36:58.950
Now, does that help you
with that truth?

36:58.984 --> 37:00.218
RHONDA:
Okay, babe, let's go.

37:00.252 --> 37:01.453
Rhonda, stop.

37:01.487 --> 37:03.054
Stop.

37:03.088 --> 37:04.790
You stay here.

37:13.332 --> 37:16.968
To hell with you, Lucious.

37:17.002 --> 37:19.104
To hell with me?
Hell with you!

37:19.137 --> 37:20.972
To hell with yo' ass!

37:32.851 --> 37:36.355
(cheering, clamoring)

37:40.158 --> 37:41.660
Hold on. Hold on.

37:44.996 --> 37:47.633
What are you doing here?

37:47.666 --> 37:50.168
I thought you were
at your mom's birthday.

37:50.201 --> 37:52.671
Yeah, I was, but it made me
want to come be here with you.

37:52.704 --> 37:53.672
I was bored.

37:53.705 --> 37:55.507
(both laugh)

37:55.541 --> 37:57.476
But, um, I had
fun with you

37:57.509 --> 37:59.478
and your family
the other night.

37:59.511 --> 38:01.913
But, like, my family,

38:01.947 --> 38:04.149
everybody's at
each other's throats.

38:04.182 --> 38:06.585
I don't want
to be like that.

38:06.618 --> 38:09.888
I want to build my own family
as beautiful as yours.

38:19.164 --> 38:20.899
Got something for you.

38:26.037 --> 38:27.373
Will you marry me?

38:30.409 --> 38:31.810
Yes.

38:33.979 --> 38:36.314
(fans cheering)

38:38.650 --> 38:40.352
(laughs)

39:09.347 --> 39:10.749
Hey.

39:14.753 --> 39:16.755
Thank you so much
for driving all this way.

39:16.788 --> 39:17.756
Yes, of course.

39:17.789 --> 39:18.757
What... what...
what happened?

39:18.790 --> 39:21.860
Oh, my God.
I don't even know.

39:21.893 --> 39:24.663
Lucious and Andre got
in this massive fight,

39:24.696 --> 39:26.498
and then Andre just
stormed off and...

39:26.532 --> 39:27.599
Girl, Lucious-- no, please.

39:27.633 --> 39:29.501
You do not need to go
into more detail.

39:29.535 --> 39:31.437
I know all about that
dysfunctional family.

39:35.040 --> 39:36.942
(crying): I just can't
take it anymore.

39:38.444 --> 39:40.579
You know, I feel like
I've spent the last

39:40.612 --> 39:44.082
ten years of my life
looking out for him,

39:44.115 --> 39:46.217
and I don't know...
I just... I really just need

39:46.251 --> 39:49.888
a day or two to
look out for myself.

39:49.921 --> 39:53.391
But I can't go back
into that house.

39:53.425 --> 39:56.528
And honestly, I don't
want to go back to my own.

39:56.562 --> 39:59.097
Listen... you
don't have to.

39:59.130 --> 40:01.232
You can stay
with me, okay?

40:01.266 --> 40:02.501
For as long as you need.

40:07.338 --> 40:09.407
Okay, I will. Thank you.

40:09.441 --> 40:13.178
It'll be nice to be around
someone sane for a change, too.

40:16.247 --> 40:18.383
JAMAL:
* Shine on me...

40:18.416 --> 40:20.486
* Sunshine, sunshine *
* Yeah

40:20.519 --> 40:23.455
* The sun will always
shine on me! *

40:24.756 --> 40:25.924
Hey, yo, that's hot, brother.

40:25.957 --> 40:27.893
Yes, that's hot!

40:27.926 --> 40:29.227
Y'all, let's take a five.

40:29.260 --> 40:30.462
COOKIE:
Yes, let's take five.

40:30.496 --> 40:32.230
That is hot.

40:32.263 --> 40:33.665
Amazing, honey.

40:33.699 --> 40:34.933
Hey, Mom.

40:34.966 --> 40:36.067
Oh, that was so good.
Okay?

40:36.101 --> 40:37.068
Come on, man,
give me some love.

40:37.102 --> 40:38.470
Okay, all right.

40:38.504 --> 40:39.838
All right.

40:39.871 --> 40:41.339
I'm sorry your birthday
got ruined.

40:41.372 --> 40:44.175
Yeah, well, at least we were all
together for a little bit.

40:44.209 --> 40:46.778
Until everything went to hell.

40:46.812 --> 40:48.480
Mom, you know Hakeem
is killing it,

40:48.514 --> 40:50.516
but if you still want
to produce on my album...

40:50.549 --> 40:52.150
Oh, no.

40:52.183 --> 40:55.353
Hakeem is doing
just fine on his own.

40:55.386 --> 40:57.355
He's producing you on his own.

40:57.388 --> 40:59.525
He got engaged on his own.

40:59.558 --> 41:01.527
Oh, you heard about that?

41:01.560 --> 41:03.862
Oh, the whole damn Internet
heard about it, boy.

41:03.895 --> 41:04.930
HAKEEM:
Look, Mom, I love her.

41:04.963 --> 41:06.532
Ready to lay my verse.

41:06.565 --> 41:08.867
Oh, you got a verse on this?

41:08.900 --> 41:09.968
How you doing, Ms. Cookie?

41:10.001 --> 41:12.003
I thought you'd
be working with Lucious.

41:12.037 --> 41:13.539
She was, till he iced her
out of the video.

41:13.572 --> 41:15.841
Now, you know that was
a very personal video.

41:15.874 --> 41:17.709
Mom, I know, and it's not even
like that anymore, I swear.

41:17.743 --> 41:19.010
It's about the music.

41:19.044 --> 41:20.111
Listen to this, come on.

41:20.145 --> 41:21.446
Take it from the second hook.

41:21.479 --> 41:22.748
Let's go.

41:24.516 --> 41:26.785
JAMAL (recorded):
* Me, just me, doing it my way

41:26.818 --> 41:28.854
* Till I see sun rays, hey

41:28.887 --> 41:31.456
* Whoo! *
* The sun will always shine

41:31.489 --> 41:33.391
* Shine *
* Sun will always shine

41:33.424 --> 41:35.527
* Shine *
* Sun will always shine

41:35.561 --> 41:37.796
* On me

41:37.829 --> 41:39.497
* Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh *
* Mm

41:39.531 --> 41:41.299
* So even if it's crime

41:41.332 --> 41:42.968
* Crime *
* I'm taking care of mine

41:43.001 --> 41:46.371
* So the sun will always shine

41:46.404 --> 41:47.706
* On me

41:47.739 --> 41:49.541
* Shine on me

41:49.575 --> 41:51.209
* I say one shot, two shot

41:51.242 --> 41:52.377
* Three shot, four

41:52.410 --> 41:54.813
* Daddy, I can't take no more

41:54.846 --> 41:57.148
* I'm sick of watching windows
'fore I walk out the door *

41:57.182 --> 41:58.984
* I know that's not
what I'm here for *

41:59.017 --> 42:00.318
* It's a brighter day

42:00.351 --> 42:02.220
* These bars sit with the Lord,
He know my story *

42:02.253 --> 42:03.922
* I'm-a tell it all
and live large *

42:03.955 --> 42:05.390
* Before I'm 40, Frank Gathers

42:05.423 --> 42:07.158
* This your daughter,
e'rybody know it *

42:07.192 --> 42:08.526
* I could light

42:08.560 --> 42:10.829
* Bet e'rybody blow it...
Stop the track.

42:10.862 --> 42:12.397
* The impact, I did that...
Mama, what are you doing?

42:12.430 --> 42:13.832
(song stops)
Just a moment... uh...

42:13.865 --> 42:15.433
Freda,

42:15.466 --> 42:17.569
did you say something
about Frank Gathers?

42:17.603 --> 42:19.070
Yeah, that's my father.

42:19.104 --> 42:20.438
I mean, was my father.

42:20.471 --> 42:22.440
He got murdered in prison.

42:22.473 --> 42:24.676
JAMAL: Damn, I knew he was dead.
I didn't know he was murdered.

42:24.710 --> 42:27.078
Yeah, man, they still
ain't caught who did it.

42:27.112 --> 42:28.947
I mean, they acting
like they don't care.

42:28.980 --> 42:30.181
I mean, I care.

42:30.215 --> 42:32.784
I ain't going to
never stop caring.
JAMAL: Yeah.

42:33.785 --> 42:35.787
You know my father,
too, Ms. Cookie?

42:37.088 --> 42:38.690
Yeah, mm-hmm, he and me...

42:38.724 --> 42:40.425
Look, y'all sound amazing.

42:40.458 --> 42:42.661
Keep working, all right?
I'll be back.
