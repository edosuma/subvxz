00:01.392 --> 00:04.221
Previously onSalvation...Darius!

00:04.265 --> 00:06.049
Nicholas Tanz,
this is Liam Cole.

00:06.093 --> 00:08.095
Nicholas is my...Uncle, I know.

00:08.138 --> 00:11.533
DARIUS: The unthinkable
has become reality.

00:11.576 --> 00:13.230
President Pauline Mackenzie
is dead.

00:13.274 --> 00:14.884
Who do you work for?

00:14.927 --> 00:16.538
Q

00:16.581 --> 00:19.019
They're like a private CIA.

00:19.062 --> 00:20.977
GRACE:
Claire was gonna shoot Harris.

00:21.021 --> 00:22.457
I did what I had to do
and I would do it again.

00:22.500 --> 00:24.937
You want justice?
Take it.

00:26.722 --> 00:29.768
You're not getting off
that easy.

00:29.812 --> 00:30.987
You're special.

00:31.031 --> 00:33.207
Can you accept that
you have a purpose?

00:33.250 --> 00:34.251
I can.

00:36.123 --> 00:38.951
LIAM:
What the hell, Darius?

00:38.995 --> 00:40.301
And where's the real
Dr. Aguirre?

00:40.344 --> 00:43.043
DARIUS: I am Aguirre,
and Aguirre is me.

00:43.086 --> 00:45.132
Liam, I did come here to
repair what's been torn.

00:45.175 --> 00:47.264
We both have the power
to shut RE/SYST down.

00:47.308 --> 00:49.962
I need your help.

00:50.006 --> 00:51.921
This chip contains a virus
that could destroy Tess.

00:51.964 --> 00:53.357
Liam? Don't!

00:53.401 --> 00:55.011
DARIUS: She's the one
controlling those nukes.

00:55.055 --> 00:58.101
I've been extremely busy
disarming RE/SYST.

00:58.145 --> 01:00.451
Those nukes were quite
the nuisance, weren't they?

01:00.495 --> 01:03.237
What have you been doing
for the last 24 hours?

01:08.198 --> 01:10.418
♪ Let me feel it

01:10.461 --> 01:14.117
♪ Let me feel it
one more time ♪

01:14.161 --> 01:16.293
♪ Yeah, I want to feel it

01:17.642 --> 01:21.777

01:26.825 --> 01:28.392
GRACE:
Darius?

01:28.436 --> 01:30.786
Sorry, I tried not to wake you.

01:30.829 --> 01:34.224
What's wrong?I had the weirdest dream.

01:34.268 --> 01:36.096
Really?
Mm.

01:36.139 --> 01:38.228
You were
president...

01:38.272 --> 01:41.884
Of the United States? No.Yeah, yeah.

01:41.927 --> 01:46.628
And we had this...
romantic interlude

01:46.671 --> 01:50.066
in the Oval Office, on the
Resolute desk, to be exact.

01:50.110 --> 01:53.461
Funny, I had the
exact same dream.
What?

01:53.504 --> 01:55.245
It was a good one,
wasn't it?

01:55.289 --> 01:58.466
Oh, the best one I've
had in a long time.

02:01.382 --> 02:04.298
How many other presidents
you think did it on that desk?

02:04.341 --> 02:06.169
Van Buren

02:06.213 --> 02:09.041
I'm thinking Grover Cleveland.
He was a wily fellow.

02:09.085 --> 02:11.131
AGENT:
Perimeter check complete.

02:11.174 --> 02:12.610
Goliath is secure.

02:12.654 --> 02:13.916
AGENT 2 :
Roger that. Perimeter secure.

02:13.959 --> 02:18.050
So, what now,
Mr. President?

02:18.094 --> 02:21.184
We go back to work.

02:21.228 --> 02:27.016
Come home to each other,
save the world in between.

02:27.059 --> 02:28.626
You make it
sound simple.

02:28.670 --> 02:32.021
We've stabilized the country,
disarmed RE/SYST.

02:32.064 --> 02:33.805
The rail gun project's on track.

02:33.849 --> 02:35.198
In short order,
we'll return to normalcy.

02:35.242 --> 02:40.072
Then we can figure out
"Now what?" In the meantime,

02:40.116 --> 02:41.683
we have now.

02:44.076 --> 02:46.383
Yeah, only right now

02:46.427 --> 02:50.735
my father's sitting
in prison 'cause of me.

02:50.779 --> 02:53.216
Your father's a patriot,
and so are you.

02:53.260 --> 02:54.783
I'll take care of him.

02:56.219 --> 03:00.180
You... just need to

03:00.223 --> 03:03.270
enjoy your breakfast.

03:03.313 --> 03:05.576
♪ Let me feel it

03:05.620 --> 03:07.709
♪ Honey, let me feel it

03:07.752 --> 03:10.190
♪ I have to feel it.

03:12.192 --> 03:15.630
Any new updates?

03:15.673 --> 03:17.632
I've had a team
working all night,

03:17.675 --> 03:20.243
poring through the material
from the Q-17 operatives.

03:20.287 --> 03:21.636
Please tell me
you found something.

03:21.679 --> 03:24.552
Q-17 is financed by
a series of shell corps,

03:24.595 --> 03:26.380
but we didn't know
who was involved

03:26.423 --> 03:29.339
in said corps until now.

03:29.383 --> 03:31.733
Our president has a problem.

03:38.827 --> 03:40.307
WOMAN:
Welcome back, Darius.

03:41.830 --> 03:44.224
MAN:
Hello, Mr. President.

03:44.267 --> 03:46.269
Oh, so you think
you can just strut in here

03:46.313 --> 03:48.271
like you own the place?

03:51.405 --> 03:55.235
And you, what have
you got for me?

03:55.278 --> 03:57.498
Well, thanks to
Dr. Raul Aguirre...

03:57.541 --> 03:59.021
:
Aguirre.

03:59.064 --> 04:01.023
...the solar sail
is almost ready for launch.

04:01.066 --> 04:02.633
All it needs
is a ride up there

04:02.677 --> 04:03.939
and the right
weather conditions.

04:03.982 --> 04:05.897
When's the next
launch window?
Three days.

04:05.941 --> 04:08.291
She's being loaded into a
Goliath Two rocket as we speak.

04:08.335 --> 04:11.120
Then we start firing
the rail gun,

04:11.163 --> 04:13.644
and it's all systems go.

04:13.688 --> 04:17.387
Asteroid, stop.

04:17.431 --> 04:21.783
Nice to see things
returning to normal here.

04:21.826 --> 04:24.089
More than you know.

04:36.058 --> 04:38.321
Just as I left it.

04:38.365 --> 04:39.496
Not quite.

04:39.540 --> 04:40.889
TESS:
Welcome home, Darius.

04:41.890 --> 04:43.326
Tess?

04:43.370 --> 04:45.807
Admin voice pattern
authenticated.

04:45.850 --> 04:48.113
I restored her OS using
her original source code,

04:48.157 --> 04:52.379
and she's back to how
she was before RE/SYST.

04:52.422 --> 04:55.382
Thank you.

04:55.425 --> 04:56.818
Don't get all sentimental on me.

04:56.861 --> 04:59.124
There's still a big-ass
space rock coming toward us.

04:59.168 --> 05:01.475
We've got work to do.

05:01.518 --> 05:03.520
Once the sail is
safely deployed,

05:03.564 --> 05:06.393
the rail gun will need
your undivided attention.

05:06.436 --> 05:08.003
Yeah, you'll have it.

05:08.046 --> 05:09.265
But first,
there's something

05:09.309 --> 05:13.182
that needs your
immediate attention.

05:13.225 --> 05:15.053
Thank you.

05:17.012 --> 05:19.188
Hi.

05:19.231 --> 05:20.842
Hi.

05:21.973 --> 05:23.497
I don't know where to start.

05:23.540 --> 05:26.369
Liam, now's not the time.

05:26.413 --> 05:28.371
Agreed, but, hey,
why don't we grab dinner?

05:28.415 --> 05:31.983
Can we get a coffee?

05:32.027 --> 05:34.595
Jillian, I wasn't myself
these past two months.

05:34.638 --> 05:36.727
That's not me.
I was brainwashed.

05:36.771 --> 05:37.815
RE/SYST talked a good game.

05:37.859 --> 05:39.382
RE/SYST or Alycia?

05:41.515 --> 05:44.300
I... I just want us
to have a fresh start.

05:47.695 --> 05:49.436
We can't change the past.

05:49.479 --> 05:52.047
We can only accept
what's happened and move on.

05:52.090 --> 05:54.310
I'm in a good place

05:54.354 --> 05:57.400
for the first time in a while,

05:57.444 --> 06:01.883
and I want to stay there, Liam.

06:08.150 --> 06:09.369
The president's already
given his statement

06:09.412 --> 06:10.935
on the matter, Phil.

06:10.979 --> 06:12.415
He'll appoint a vice president
when he's good and ready,

06:12.459 --> 06:13.895
on his timetable,

06:13.938 --> 06:16.463
not the media's.
Thank you.

06:20.162 --> 06:21.511
You look like
you haven't slept.

06:21.555 --> 06:23.470
That's because
I haven't. You?

06:23.513 --> 06:26.908
Mm, hmm, not much.

06:26.951 --> 06:30.520
The FBI spent all night
going down the Q-17 rabbit hole.

06:30.564 --> 06:32.348
And?
They managed
to locate this.

06:32.392 --> 06:34.002
What is this?

06:34.045 --> 06:36.004
Founding members
of Q-17.

06:36.047 --> 06:37.571
Best guess,
Switzerland, 1987.

06:37.614 --> 06:39.399
At least, that's what
the FBI thinks.

06:39.442 --> 06:40.922
Looks like the Last Supper.

06:40.965 --> 06:42.445
More like a meeting
of the Five Families.

06:42.489 --> 06:43.794
You recognize anyone?

06:45.927 --> 06:48.364
Wait, is that...?Nicholas Tanz.

06:48.408 --> 06:49.496
Our president's uncle.

06:49.539 --> 06:51.454
ROLAND:
I'm sorry, Mr. President,

06:51.498 --> 06:55.502
but as White House Counsel,
I need to counsel,

06:55.545 --> 06:58.896
and your idea
is a disastrous one.Disastrous?

06:58.940 --> 07:00.811
That's a little hyperbolic,
don't you think?

07:00.855 --> 07:03.248
The optics of granting
Hugh Keating

07:03.292 --> 07:04.467
a full pardon are...

07:04.511 --> 07:06.861
Well, they're terrible.

07:06.904 --> 07:08.819
He's the father
of your senior advisor.

07:08.863 --> 07:10.430
Claire Rayburn was a traitor.

07:10.473 --> 07:12.257
Hugh Keating should be
commended, not condemned.

07:12.301 --> 07:13.476
I don't care whose father he is.

07:13.520 --> 07:14.825
The public
will assume

07:14.869 --> 07:16.479
that you're part
of an elaborate cover-up.

07:16.523 --> 07:17.785
They'll call for your head.

07:17.828 --> 07:20.657
And I'll gladly
give it to them, Roland.

07:20.701 --> 07:22.877
My administration has
stabilized the country,

07:22.920 --> 07:24.444
disarmed RE/SYST.

07:24.487 --> 07:26.533
Now all that's left
is that damn asteroid.

07:26.576 --> 07:29.361
Politics doesn't need me.
Tanz Industries does.

07:29.405 --> 07:30.885
There's no...

07:30.928 --> 07:33.931
Vice president. I'll need
a short list of candidates,

07:33.975 --> 07:36.281
a consensus builder
with a clean slate.

07:36.325 --> 07:38.066
Someone I can hand
the reins over to

07:38.109 --> 07:42.157
and still sleep at night.To be clear,

07:42.200 --> 07:43.506
you want to resign?

07:43.550 --> 07:45.639
Yes.

07:45.682 --> 07:48.685
Mr. President, we need to talk.

07:48.729 --> 07:51.122
DARIUS:
That son of a bitch.

07:51.166 --> 07:53.908
All this madness, the chaos,
caused by Nicholas

07:53.951 --> 07:55.736
and his Billionaire
Boys Club?

07:55.779 --> 07:57.259
The Bureau's
best theory

07:57.302 --> 07:58.521
is that sometime
in the late '80s,

07:58.565 --> 08:00.480
17 of the world's
wealthiest magnates

08:00.523 --> 08:01.785
pooled their resources
together--

08:01.829 --> 08:03.744
oil, power, shipping,
mineral mining--

08:03.787 --> 08:05.180
to further
their own self-interests.

08:05.223 --> 08:08.575
They formed Q-17
as their own personal CIA

08:08.618 --> 08:09.837
to do their bidding:
meddle in governments,

08:09.880 --> 08:11.229
foment rebellions,

08:11.273 --> 08:12.753
assassinate presidents.

08:12.796 --> 08:15.190
We didn't have
a Manchurian candidate,

08:15.233 --> 08:19.020
we had a Manchurian government,
funded by dark money.

08:19.063 --> 08:21.849
To do unspeakable things.A space rock on the way,

08:21.892 --> 08:24.460
and they're playing some
bizarre game of chess. Why?

08:24.504 --> 08:26.244
I want you to follow that money.

08:26.288 --> 08:28.290
Find a way to tie
Uncle Nick and his cronies

08:28.333 --> 08:29.639
to everything that's happened.

08:29.683 --> 08:31.467
What are you doing?

08:31.511 --> 08:34.426
It's time to invite dear
Uncle Nick to the White House.

08:38.735 --> 08:40.737
♪

08:51.574 --> 08:53.837
GRACE: So, after all the
FBI's digging, we have a photo

08:53.881 --> 08:55.926
with 17 people and only one
of them's identifiable.

08:55.970 --> 08:57.537
We know they're billionaires
from across the globe,

08:57.580 --> 08:59.843
hiding behind shadow
organizations and bank accounts.

08:59.887 --> 09:02.063
Smart enough to infiltrate our
government without fingerprints.

09:02.106 --> 09:03.281
Well, hang on.

09:03.325 --> 09:06.110
They left a different
kind of fingerprint.

09:06.154 --> 09:07.416
Bitcoin.

09:07.459 --> 09:09.592
We can't go to that well.

09:09.636 --> 09:11.725
Alonzo led us to that
bitcoin flash drive.

09:11.768 --> 09:14.510
Who knows what else he's got?
He's fast,

09:14.554 --> 09:16.294
he works outside the system...He almost shot me in the head.

09:16.338 --> 09:19.733
Which is why I'll
approach him alone.

09:19.776 --> 09:22.605
Harris, that man's
been through enough.

09:22.649 --> 09:24.868
Grace, we've all been
through enough.

09:24.912 --> 09:27.871
He won't talk to you.

09:27.915 --> 09:30.657
It's got to be me.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.748
The simulation looks good.

09:34.791 --> 09:38.012
All right. Okay, we'll
let Tess run the numbers.

09:38.055 --> 09:39.753
It's gonna be close.

09:39.796 --> 09:43.844
If it's even an ounce too heavy,
it may not deploy in time.

09:43.887 --> 09:45.106
Hey, Jillian.

09:45.149 --> 09:46.368
JILLIAN:
Hey, uh...

09:46.411 --> 09:49.110
So, I was thinking
about what you said.

09:49.153 --> 09:51.068
You still want a fresh start?

09:51.112 --> 09:53.941
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

09:53.984 --> 09:57.335
Oh, uh, what if I swing by
later, so we can talk?

09:57.379 --> 09:59.860
Great, great. Yeah, it's a date.

09:59.903 --> 10:02.340
I'll see you then.

10:05.430 --> 10:07.998
Are you sure about this?

10:08.042 --> 10:10.087
NATE: Absolutely.
You need to give him a chance

10:10.131 --> 10:11.567
to prove he's worthy.

10:11.611 --> 10:14.396
Yeah.

10:14.439 --> 10:16.659
Congressman Thompson,
it's an honor to sit with you.

10:16.703 --> 10:18.748
Well, I appreciate that,
Mr. President.

10:18.792 --> 10:22.317
So, graduate of the
Air Force Academy,

10:22.360 --> 10:25.581
degree in mathematics,
NASA shuttle pilot,

10:25.625 --> 10:27.278
then politics?

10:27.322 --> 10:30.325
Well, I lived my dream.
I had a family on the ground.

10:30.368 --> 10:32.806
I wanted to make the world
a better place for my kids.

10:32.849 --> 10:34.503
How's that going?

10:34.546 --> 10:36.418
No doubt, this country
has seen better days.

10:36.461 --> 10:38.899
Cosmic threats, coups.

10:38.942 --> 10:40.422
"The once unthinkable
is now the routine."

10:40.465 --> 10:41.945
I believe those are your words.Good memory.

10:41.989 --> 10:44.818
Even if we prevail
over that asteroid,

10:44.861 --> 10:47.124
there are still
dark forces here on Earth,

10:47.168 --> 10:48.386
and I want to protect
this country

10:48.430 --> 10:49.953
from those forces at all costs.

10:52.216 --> 10:54.610
Can I be frank,
Mr. President?

10:54.654 --> 10:56.133
You talk a good game.

10:56.177 --> 10:59.223
You got the smile,
that fancy accent.

10:59.267 --> 11:01.182
But at the end of the day,
you're just another billionaire

11:01.225 --> 11:04.489
with an agenda none of us
can quite figure out.

11:04.533 --> 11:07.144
Really? Last time I looked,
I was putting down rebellions.

11:07.188 --> 11:08.972
Or orchestrating them.

11:10.844 --> 11:13.716
Two-term congressman
like myself,

11:13.760 --> 11:16.110
it's an honor to be considered
for the vice presidency,

11:16.153 --> 11:17.720
but between Mackenzie's

11:17.764 --> 11:19.679
and Bennett's assassinations
on your watch,

11:19.722 --> 11:22.856
a person's got to ask themselves
how that happens.

11:24.161 --> 11:26.033
As an astronaut,

11:26.076 --> 11:28.818
you're familiar
with the concept of dark matter.

11:28.862 --> 11:30.646
Certain things
could not occur

11:30.690 --> 11:31.952
but for its presence.

11:31.995 --> 11:33.344
Same can be said for dark money.

11:33.388 --> 11:35.912
It's infiltrated our government.
We can't see it,

11:35.956 --> 11:39.046
but it's by far the greatest
threat to democracy.

11:39.089 --> 11:41.265
Dark money, my ass.
You disappeared for 48 hours.

11:41.309 --> 11:43.006
Your actions
almost got us nuked.

11:43.050 --> 11:44.486
That's pretty damn dangerous
if you ask me.

11:44.529 --> 11:46.444
But I didn't ask you.

11:46.488 --> 11:50.144
I'd do anything
to serve my country,

11:50.187 --> 11:51.754
but I'm a straight line,
Mr. President.

11:51.798 --> 11:55.192
No curves, unseen corners,
hidden agendas.

11:55.236 --> 11:57.325
I got elected because
I'm a truth teller.

11:57.368 --> 11:59.719
If you don't want the truth,
you don't want me.

12:01.764 --> 12:03.113
What the hell was that?

12:03.157 --> 12:05.420
Trey Thompson has
an 80% approval rating

12:05.463 --> 12:06.943
in his home district.

12:06.987 --> 12:08.989
You said you wanted
a straight shooter.

12:09.032 --> 12:11.469
Yes, but preferably not someone
aiming at me, Roland.

12:11.513 --> 12:13.036
Yes?

12:13.080 --> 12:14.429
Mr. President, your
visitor is here.

12:14.472 --> 12:16.083
Send him up.

12:17.824 --> 12:20.043
Do better.
Now. Quickly. Go!

12:20.087 --> 12:23.264
♪

12:25.266 --> 12:28.269
♪ Oh, oh♪

12:28.312 --> 12:30.271
♪ Oh,
oh♪

12:30.314 --> 12:32.273
♪ Only truth...

12:32.316 --> 12:34.014
Seat taken?

12:38.192 --> 12:39.802
You can't be serious.

12:39.846 --> 12:42.370
You must be stupid
coming here alone.

12:42.413 --> 12:44.415
She's not alone.

12:44.459 --> 12:46.113
How the hell'd
you find me?

12:46.156 --> 12:49.377
Your car. Government
issue, which means...

12:49.420 --> 12:52.510
LoJacked. Very good,
Mr. Secretary.

12:52.554 --> 12:54.034
You'd have made
a decent detective.

12:54.077 --> 12:56.427
But I'm not a detective.
You are.

12:58.342 --> 13:00.257
We need your help.

13:01.868 --> 13:04.348
NICHOLAS:
Darius.

13:04.392 --> 13:07.351
I've been waiting
for this invitation.

13:10.441 --> 13:11.529
I would have called sooner

13:11.573 --> 13:13.314
had I known you were
in the country.

13:13.357 --> 13:16.796
Seeing you here now,

13:16.839 --> 13:19.711
it's quite impressive.

13:19.755 --> 13:21.278
Your father'd
be very proud.

13:21.322 --> 13:23.890
He would laugh.

13:23.933 --> 13:26.196
The fact that I was born
in Philadelphia...
Was fate.

13:26.240 --> 13:28.155
Fate.

13:28.198 --> 13:30.157
To ensure your place
in this office,

13:30.200 --> 13:32.724
your place in history.But following that logic,

13:32.768 --> 13:36.250
President Mackenzie's
assassination was fate, as well.

13:39.166 --> 13:43.648
Hmm. It's a tragedy,
no doubt.

13:46.434 --> 13:50.873
In these dark times, I can't
think of anyone better than you

13:50.917 --> 13:53.354
to guide not just this country,

13:53.397 --> 13:56.270
but our planet
back into the light.

13:56.313 --> 13:58.925
That is if this rail gun
of yours works.

13:58.968 --> 14:00.317
It will.

14:00.361 --> 14:02.232
In fact, that's why
I invited you here.

14:02.276 --> 14:04.321
I'm thinking
about the future.

14:04.365 --> 14:06.367
Of course, yeah.

14:06.410 --> 14:11.372
You only call me when you need
something or you want something.

14:11.415 --> 14:14.288
Ah, you know
me too well, Uncle.

14:14.331 --> 14:16.725
All right, I'll
cut to the chase.

14:16.768 --> 14:20.903
I'm thinking about reelection.
Campaigns cost money.

14:23.340 --> 14:27.344
Oh. Oh.
It's funny, isn't it?

14:27.388 --> 14:31.566
Once you feel pure power,
you don't want to let it go.

14:31.609 --> 14:35.875
Now, my boy,
you save the planet,

14:35.918 --> 14:38.529
and there will be a lot of
influential people in your debt.

14:38.573 --> 14:42.359
I assure you, all of the
campaign funds you'll ever want

14:42.403 --> 14:44.535
will be at your disposal.

14:44.579 --> 14:46.276
Well, there's no time
like the present.

14:46.320 --> 14:48.278
Those influential people,

14:48.322 --> 14:50.237
I was thinking about
throwing a party at Tanz,

14:50.280 --> 14:53.153
a cocktail party,
the best of its kind,

14:53.196 --> 14:56.808
a sort of
welcome back for us.

14:56.852 --> 15:00.769
That's a wonderful idea.

15:00.812 --> 15:03.250
And I know just
who to invite.

15:03.293 --> 15:05.426
I thought you might.

15:07.689 --> 15:10.431
Get a vice president.

15:10.474 --> 15:13.173
The donors like to know who
they're getting into bed with.

15:13.216 --> 15:15.915
Of course, of course. I-I'll
bring my top picks to the party.

15:15.958 --> 15:19.440
Your friends, I'm sure
they'll have strong opinions.

15:19.483 --> 15:23.313
Spoken like a true politician.

15:23.357 --> 15:26.273
I'll make all
the arrangements.

15:30.451 --> 15:32.061
You kill my sister.

15:32.105 --> 15:33.410
Cover it up.

15:33.454 --> 15:36.587
Use me. Now you
want my help?

15:36.631 --> 15:38.415
Get out of my face.

15:38.459 --> 15:40.287
I should have
you both arrested.

15:40.330 --> 15:42.854
But you won't.Oh?

15:42.898 --> 15:45.292
You know damn well
it was self-defense.

15:45.335 --> 15:46.467
Grace's father already
confessed to the crime.

15:46.510 --> 15:47.685
You have your
sacrificial lamb,

15:47.729 --> 15:50.340
so why waste time
on some sort of vendetta?

15:50.384 --> 15:53.822
Alonzo, you told me you
still cared about justice.

15:53.865 --> 15:55.737
These are the people
who bankrolled

15:55.780 --> 15:57.521
Claire and
Bennett's operation,

15:57.565 --> 15:59.306
who bought our government.Are you for real right now?

15:59.349 --> 16:02.396
You gonna look at me and
pretend like nothing happened?

16:02.439 --> 16:05.138
Can you give us
a minute, please?

16:10.317 --> 16:12.232
I'm sorry.

16:12.275 --> 16:14.582
If I had any other options,
we wouldn't be here right now.

16:14.625 --> 16:17.237
Did it ever occur to you
that I started to care for you?

16:20.327 --> 16:22.329
I'm sorry.

16:22.372 --> 16:24.635
You and Mr. Secretary
can walk your sorry asses

16:24.679 --> 16:26.202
up out this bar.

16:31.338 --> 16:33.035
Let's go.
No.

16:33.079 --> 16:35.298
Harris.Listen,
you self-indulgent prick.

16:35.342 --> 16:37.518
It's time to stop thinking about
your feelings and get on board.Stop. No, no.

16:37.561 --> 16:38.867
What'd you just say?You heard me.

16:38.910 --> 16:40.129
Grace, back up.

16:40.173 --> 16:41.435
You know, you've
been asking for it.

16:41.478 --> 16:43.393
What are you waiting for,
Detective? Go for it!

16:48.442 --> 16:50.487
Put your hands up, sir.

16:55.797 --> 16:57.407
Detective Carter,

16:57.451 --> 16:59.366
you just assaulted the
secretary of defense

16:59.409 --> 17:00.628
in a bar full of witnesses.

17:00.671 --> 17:02.369
I can have you arrested,

17:02.412 --> 17:05.372
but I won't if
you cooperate.

17:05.415 --> 17:08.766
You son of a bitch.
You set me up.

17:08.810 --> 17:12.944
I'm giving you an opportunity
to put your anger to bed

17:12.988 --> 17:16.818
and make yourself useful.
I suggest you take it. Now.

17:30.310 --> 17:32.399
DARIUS:
Senator Gitlow.

17:32.442 --> 17:34.923
So you're the chairman of the
Commerce and Science Committee?

17:34.966 --> 17:38.274
Ten years in the Senate,
five years on the committee.

17:38.318 --> 17:40.407
You scientists
always amaze me.

17:40.450 --> 17:42.670
Somewhere around
Newton's Third Law

17:42.713 --> 17:44.672
I threw my hands up
and cried uncle.

17:44.715 --> 17:46.848
From what I've seen, politics
is a lot more complicated

17:46.891 --> 17:49.503
and unknowable than any
scientific formula or algorithm.

17:49.546 --> 17:52.288
It's simpler than people
make it out to be.

17:53.768 --> 17:56.031
I come from a small town
in Michigan.

17:56.075 --> 17:57.598
My father worked
the assembly line.

17:57.641 --> 17:59.295
We weathered
the Great Recession,

17:59.339 --> 18:01.210
so I know what
American families go through

18:01.254 --> 18:02.603
just to make ends meet.

18:02.646 --> 18:04.735
I consider it
a privilege to serve.

18:04.779 --> 18:06.302
The rest is all
just nonsense.

18:06.346 --> 18:08.739
Well, you have fans on
both sides of the aisle.

18:08.783 --> 18:10.611
That's-that's rare these days.

18:10.654 --> 18:13.788
I try to start
from a place of decency.

18:13.831 --> 18:15.746
Does that make me soft
as my opponent

18:15.790 --> 18:17.922
in the last election
would claim? No, sir.

18:17.966 --> 18:21.535
Decency is the steel that
keeps our building standing

18:21.578 --> 18:23.058
even in the worst of storms.

18:25.104 --> 18:28.281
I always appreciated that
quality in Pauline Mackenzie.

18:30.544 --> 18:33.286
Yes. So did I.

18:35.549 --> 18:38.073
With all that's happened,
it's comforting

18:38.117 --> 18:41.859
having someone in that chair
who's carrying out her legacy.

18:49.824 --> 18:52.609
LIAM: I thought we were going
somewhere we could talk.

18:52.653 --> 18:54.263
JILLIAN:
And we are.

18:54.307 --> 18:58.528
MAN: COPE was founded
by Bass Shepherd,

18:58.572 --> 19:01.879
author of 15 best-selling
self-help books

19:01.923 --> 19:04.969
that have sold nine million
copies worldwide,

19:05.013 --> 19:07.668
and has turned his decades-long
search for peace and acceptance

19:07.711 --> 19:09.931
into a movement.

19:09.974 --> 19:11.715
Bass has healed millions
of people around the world.

19:11.759 --> 19:14.109
Hi.
Jillian.

19:14.153 --> 19:15.632
Nora, this is Liam.

19:15.676 --> 19:17.460
Welcome.

19:17.504 --> 19:20.333
People are learning
to cope with what is.

19:20.376 --> 19:22.509
BASS:
Regrets.

19:22.552 --> 19:27.644
What purpose do they serve?
Nora?

19:27.688 --> 19:29.603
They make us feel guilty.

19:29.646 --> 19:30.691
And what do we think
about guilt?

19:30.734 --> 19:32.083
It's a useless emotion.

19:32.127 --> 19:33.084
BASS:
It weighs us down.

19:33.128 --> 19:34.651
We make mistakes.

19:34.695 --> 19:36.610
We're human.

19:36.653 --> 19:38.481
This watch?

19:38.525 --> 19:40.962
$5,000.

19:41.005 --> 19:43.573
I was so proud
the day I bought it.

19:43.617 --> 19:47.403
But now I realize
the value of the watch

19:47.447 --> 19:49.579
doesn't change the time we have.

19:49.623 --> 19:53.714
My biggest regret
is putting value on things

19:53.757 --> 19:55.194
instead of people.

19:55.237 --> 19:59.807
Relationships.
What's important

19:59.850 --> 20:02.592
isn't the time on our wrist.

20:02.636 --> 20:04.072
It's our time together.

20:05.595 --> 20:07.684
So I invite you
to throw your regrets

20:07.728 --> 20:10.557
into the unburdening box.

20:10.600 --> 20:13.429
It's time to forget what was...

20:13.473 --> 20:15.649
ALL:
And accept what is.

20:17.041 --> 20:20.219
My name's Nora,
and I regret

20:20.262 --> 20:24.223
not being
at my mother's deathbed.

20:26.529 --> 20:31.534
I'm Nate, and I regret not
sharing my feelings enough.

20:37.584 --> 20:40.717
My name's Liam, but
I'm-I'm just a visitor.

20:40.761 --> 20:41.849
No regrets?

20:41.892 --> 20:44.025
This is a chance
to unburden yourself.

20:44.068 --> 20:46.810
No, I-I have a ton of regrets.

20:46.854 --> 20:50.553
Uh... I've made epic mistakes.

20:50.597 --> 20:53.426
You know, I've-I've hurt
people I love.

20:53.469 --> 20:57.604
But saying it aloud
doesn't absolve me.

20:57.647 --> 20:59.170
It doesn't mean I'm worthy
of forgiveness.

20:59.214 --> 21:00.302
Ah.

21:00.346 --> 21:02.043
There it is.

21:02.086 --> 21:03.436
"I'm not worthy."

21:05.089 --> 21:07.309
What do we do
to become worthy?

21:07.353 --> 21:08.528
JILLIAN:
Acknowledging our mistakes

21:08.571 --> 21:11.661
and accepting them.

21:13.228 --> 21:15.099
Liam,

21:15.143 --> 21:17.580
accept yourself,

21:17.624 --> 21:20.670
as we accept you.

21:22.585 --> 21:24.674
I forgive you.

21:40.821 --> 21:43.214
Okay, what the hell
is this

21:43.258 --> 21:44.781
ALONZO:
You wanted everything I have.

21:44.825 --> 21:47.567
This came from a flash drive
I found in Claire's house.

21:47.610 --> 21:49.612
With a trove of information.

21:49.656 --> 21:50.787
Yeah, okay, can we just

21:50.831 --> 21:52.702
get on with this, please?

21:52.746 --> 21:54.878
When I started investigating
Claire's disappearance,

21:54.922 --> 21:57.011
my only lead was,
well, looking into

21:57.054 --> 21:58.621
Defense Secretary Centerfold.

21:58.665 --> 22:01.102
After we cracked
the bitcoin wallet,

22:01.145 --> 22:03.365
I figured I'd try the same
password on this file.

22:08.239 --> 22:09.458
HARRIS:
Bank account numbers.

22:09.502 --> 22:11.373
Cayman Islands
bank account numbers.

22:11.417 --> 22:13.332
Where the wealthy go
to hide their money

22:13.375 --> 22:14.463
and identities.

22:14.507 --> 22:16.857
17 accounts.
Huh.

22:16.900 --> 22:18.989
What do you want to bet
those 17 belong

22:19.033 --> 22:21.035
to the 17 people
in the photo?

22:21.078 --> 22:23.820
I'd also bet this money was used
to buy cryptocurrency

22:23.864 --> 22:26.649
that paid for assassinations
of American citizens...

22:26.693 --> 22:28.085
and presidents.

22:28.129 --> 22:30.349
This is the jackpot.

22:30.392 --> 22:33.003
Yeah, problem is, only way
to access the jackpot

22:33.047 --> 22:36.398
is with biometric proof
you're the account holder.

22:36.442 --> 22:38.531
Retinal scans.An encryption code

22:38.574 --> 22:39.923
based on the iris.

22:39.967 --> 22:41.403
There's no way to hack that.

22:41.447 --> 22:43.753
No, you're gonna need
the exact right pair of eyeballs

22:43.797 --> 22:45.842
to open these accounts.

22:45.886 --> 22:47.975
Any idea how we're gonna
get those?

22:50.760 --> 22:54.111
BOTH:
Darius.

22:54.155 --> 22:57.376
So, how amazing is he... Bass?

22:57.419 --> 23:00.248
:
Yeah.

23:00.291 --> 23:02.685
And he's allowed
me to accept you

23:02.729 --> 23:06.950
and everything
that's happened.

23:09.388 --> 23:10.432
Jillian...

23:10.476 --> 23:12.869
Mm.

23:16.264 --> 23:18.614
I just spent two months
under the sway of RE/SYST.

23:18.658 --> 23:21.182
I know how easy it is to get
swept up in an ideology.

23:21.225 --> 23:22.444
Well, I'm not swept up.

23:22.488 --> 23:24.185
I'm content.

23:24.228 --> 23:28.058
COPE-- it's, it's helped me
through the worst of times.

23:28.102 --> 23:30.147
And I hardly think that
you're in the position

23:30.191 --> 23:31.671
to judge what works for people.

23:31.714 --> 23:33.934
You're right.

23:33.977 --> 23:36.850
I'm sorry.

23:36.893 --> 23:38.199
Thank you.

23:38.242 --> 23:41.289
If COPE works for you,
then, um, I'm on board.

23:41.332 --> 23:43.073
Okay.

23:53.432 --> 23:54.955
Did you know that
the false-acceptance rate

23:54.998 --> 23:56.652
for the average
fingerprint scan

23:56.696 --> 23:58.001
is one in every 10,000?

23:58.045 --> 24:00.569
For iris scans, it's about
one in two trillion.

24:00.613 --> 24:03.006
So, it's impossible
to fool the sensors?

24:03.050 --> 24:05.487
Yes, but we won't need to.

24:05.531 --> 24:07.402
How much do you want
to bet that every name

24:07.446 --> 24:08.708
behind those accounts
will be amongst those

24:08.751 --> 24:10.057
attending my party?

24:10.100 --> 24:11.406
What party?

24:11.450 --> 24:14.061
Fund-raiser, actually thrown
by dear Uncle Nick

24:14.104 --> 24:16.063
and 100 of his closest friends.

24:16.106 --> 24:17.368
They're coming out
of the shadows

24:17.412 --> 24:18.761
for face time
with the president.

24:18.805 --> 24:20.502
I've chummed the waters,

24:20.546 --> 24:22.112
now we catch the big fish.

24:22.156 --> 24:26.726
After we wine and dine them,
we end them.

24:41.741 --> 24:43.699
You look exquisite.

24:43.743 --> 24:45.092
Thank you.

24:45.135 --> 24:49.618
And you look... hot,
Mr. President.

24:49.662 --> 24:52.926
I have to admit
I do love saying that.

24:52.969 --> 24:57.278
Enjoy it; you may not be able
to say it much longer.

24:57.321 --> 25:00.368
I'm announcing Senator Gitlow
as vice president tonight.

25:00.411 --> 25:04.503
Shortly thereafter,
I'm resigning.

25:04.546 --> 25:05.808
Not before I issue
a presidential pardon

25:05.852 --> 25:08.419
for your father.

25:08.463 --> 25:11.118
So you're gonna stop
an asteroid,

25:11.161 --> 25:14.121
save democracy,
release my father...

25:14.164 --> 25:15.514
and that's just Thursday?

25:17.559 --> 25:21.041
Miles to go before
we sleep, but...

25:21.084 --> 25:23.260
I do see a rail gun at
the end of the tunnel.

25:23.304 --> 25:24.566
Hmm.

25:24.610 --> 25:27.482
Hopefully, it'll fire
on all cylinders.

25:34.184 --> 25:37.405
Good evening, Mr. President.

25:38.449 --> 25:40.016
Ms. Barrows.

25:41.191 --> 25:43.193
Detective Carter,

25:43.237 --> 25:44.325
thank you for volunteering
on this.

25:44.368 --> 25:46.022
Let's just call it
community service.

25:55.466 --> 25:57.425
DARIUS:
These lenses are scanners.

25:57.468 --> 25:58.948
The goal: to make eye contact

25:58.992 --> 26:01.037
with all of our guests
downstairs.

26:01.081 --> 26:02.822
Scan their retinas,
see which of our partygoers

26:02.865 --> 26:06.521
matches
those Cayman Islands accounts.

26:06.565 --> 26:09.263
Connection's good, sir.

26:09.306 --> 26:11.657
All right, we all set
with the plan?

26:11.700 --> 26:14.485
Pretty simple.
Make eye contact,

26:14.529 --> 26:16.270
leave the rest up to technology.

26:16.313 --> 26:17.619
These people are killers.

26:17.663 --> 26:19.055
They may not pull
the triggers themselves,

26:19.099 --> 26:21.101
but they're just as dangerous.

26:21.144 --> 26:22.319
This may be our
one and only chance

26:22.363 --> 26:24.278
to identify them

26:24.321 --> 26:27.586
and nail these bastards
to the wall.

26:34.157 --> 26:35.681
Here we go.

26:35.724 --> 26:38.814
GRACE:
Think all 17 founding
members are here?

26:38.858 --> 26:40.337
DARIUS:
In all likelihood, yes.

26:40.381 --> 26:42.949
An audience with the president
is no small feat.

26:42.992 --> 26:44.907
Uncle Nicholas would
use this opportunity

26:44.951 --> 26:46.561
to cement his power
within the group.

26:46.605 --> 26:47.910
Mr. President.Nice to see you.

26:47.954 --> 26:49.477
How are you, sir?

26:49.520 --> 26:52.480
Such vile human beings,
all in one place.

26:52.523 --> 26:54.177
Let's hope so.

26:54.221 --> 26:57.659
Smile, Ms. Barrows.
They're watching.

26:57.703 --> 26:59.835
NICHOLAS:
There he is,

26:59.879 --> 27:02.316
the President
of the United States.

27:03.534 --> 27:07.060
Ivan Petrenko.Mr. President.

27:07.103 --> 27:08.801
NICHOLAS:
That's, uh, Eloise Turner.

27:08.844 --> 27:09.845
May I present

27:09.889 --> 27:12.805
my nephew, Darius Tanz.Pleasure.

27:12.848 --> 27:15.068
My senior advisor...Grace Barrows.

27:15.111 --> 27:16.591
:
Yes.
:
Hello.

27:16.635 --> 27:18.027
My pleasure.

27:21.596 --> 27:23.250
Mr. President,

27:23.293 --> 27:25.426
you've presided
over trying times.

27:25.469 --> 27:27.733
And what a job
he's done, eh?

27:27.776 --> 27:30.431
Do you know he's on track
to solve this asteroid problem?

27:32.041 --> 27:34.478
If anyone can do it,
Darius can.

27:34.522 --> 27:36.785
You give me too much credit.

27:36.829 --> 27:38.308
There's hundreds,
if not thousands,

27:38.352 --> 27:40.093
of workers on the team.

27:40.136 --> 27:41.964
But you're the mastermind
behind it, eh?

27:42.008 --> 27:45.751
I seem to have inherited
that quality from you, Uncle.

27:46.708 --> 27:48.623
Might we have a word?

27:48.667 --> 27:50.407
Excuse us.

27:51.582 --> 27:55.108
DARIUS:
Grace, keep an eye on
Mr. Petrenko for me.

27:57.110 --> 27:59.416
Well, Mr. President,

27:59.460 --> 28:02.115
any thoughts
to the vice presidency?

28:02.158 --> 28:03.551
As a matter of fact,
I have.

28:05.074 --> 28:06.380
I'm sorry, Congressman,

28:06.423 --> 28:08.208
the president went

28:08.251 --> 28:10.384
in another direction.I'm sure he did.

28:10.427 --> 28:12.429
ROLAND:
But he remains a very big fan.

28:12.473 --> 28:14.170
In your next life,
you should be a stable boy,

28:14.214 --> 28:15.737
'cause you sure know how
to shovel manure.

28:15.781 --> 28:18.174
ALONZO:
It's absolutely ridiculous.

28:18.218 --> 28:19.523
This gentleman comes over,
right?

28:19.567 --> 28:21.700
And, essentially,
he's trying to

28:21.743 --> 28:22.744
shut down my party.

28:22.788 --> 28:26.574
So I did what anyone would do.

28:26.617 --> 28:28.532
I bought the hotel
and kept the party going.

28:29.446 --> 28:31.492
As you should.
Right?

28:31.535 --> 28:34.538
I'm sorry, forgive me,
I didn't catch your name.

28:34.582 --> 28:36.323
Andrey.
Andrey Vasilyev.

28:36.366 --> 28:37.411
Nice to meet you.

28:37.454 --> 28:39.543
Nice to meet you.Well, to success.

28:39.587 --> 28:42.459
ALL:
Cheers.

28:46.159 --> 28:47.987
Good evening,
Mr. Vasilyev.

28:48.030 --> 28:49.640
Yeah, Russian billionaire.

28:49.684 --> 28:52.600
Arms manufacturer
and land acquisitions.

28:52.643 --> 28:54.167
Dude owns islands.

28:54.210 --> 28:55.559
Are you one of our
dirty 17?

28:57.648 --> 29:00.477
No match.
Damn it.

29:03.611 --> 29:05.439
So, Mr. Tanz is sure

29:05.482 --> 29:07.354
his rail gun project
will work?

29:07.397 --> 29:08.834
Confidence is very high.

29:08.877 --> 29:10.357
Otherwise, the president
wouldn't be here

29:10.400 --> 29:12.576
talking about the future,
Mr. Petrenko.

29:14.796 --> 29:16.058
He's a match.

29:16.102 --> 29:17.843
All right.

29:17.886 --> 29:19.801
All right, all right.

29:19.845 --> 29:22.456
Get back out there, Detective.Detective?

29:22.499 --> 29:24.153
Actually, I'm in
real estate now.

29:24.197 --> 29:25.459
Dabble in tech.

29:25.502 --> 29:26.765
I'm making some
good contacts.

29:26.808 --> 29:28.549
All right,
just get down there.

29:28.592 --> 29:30.681
All right?

29:30.725 --> 29:34.033
Okay.

29:34.076 --> 29:36.122
Who's next?

29:36.165 --> 29:38.820
♪

29:50.353 --> 29:52.529
Yes.

29:56.577 --> 29:58.884
♪

30:02.713 --> 30:06.065
Ivan, you're hogging all
of Ms. Barrows' time.

30:07.675 --> 30:09.677
Would you mind if I have a few
words with our president's

30:09.720 --> 30:13.115
senior advisor?Certainly.

30:14.551 --> 30:16.815
Fantastic turnout, yeah?

30:16.858 --> 30:18.947
I know Darius
is very grateful

30:18.991 --> 30:21.080
for your help in gathering
everyone here tonight.

30:21.123 --> 30:22.690
Oh, absolutely.
My pleasure.

30:22.733 --> 30:24.431
He's family.

30:24.474 --> 30:26.694
We have to put family
first, don't we?

30:26.737 --> 30:28.174
Of course, yes.

30:28.217 --> 30:30.567
Without family,
what is there?
Oh, precisely.

30:30.611 --> 30:32.656
M-May I ask,

30:32.700 --> 30:34.833
how's your daughter?

30:34.876 --> 30:36.878
Zoe, is it?

30:36.922 --> 30:39.620
Zoe is doing fine,
thank you.

30:39.663 --> 30:40.534
Ah.

30:40.577 --> 30:43.102
I spent some time in Africa.

30:43.145 --> 30:46.453
A wonderful place.
So beautiful

30:46.496 --> 30:48.368
but quite dangerous.

30:48.411 --> 30:52.328
Uh, sorry, I don't recall
telling you

30:52.372 --> 30:53.895
Zoe was in Africa.

30:53.939 --> 30:56.332
Did you not? Hmm.

30:56.376 --> 30:58.334
Perhaps it was my nephew.

30:58.378 --> 31:00.597
It's difficult
to know where

31:00.641 --> 31:03.644
we get our information
from these days.

31:06.342 --> 31:08.562
Will you excuse me?

31:16.004 --> 31:19.225
Well, thank you.Mr. President.

31:19.268 --> 31:21.836
I've made eye contact
with just about everyone.

31:21.880 --> 31:23.664
How was your chat
with Uncle Nicholas?

31:23.707 --> 31:26.014
Really creepy.
He asked things about Zoe.

31:26.058 --> 31:27.581
Things he shouldn't know.

31:27.624 --> 31:29.017
Can you just announce
Gitlow as VP

31:29.061 --> 31:32.891
so we can end this party
and get away from these people?

31:35.894 --> 31:38.418
What's wrong?

31:44.380 --> 31:47.253
MAN: For all of you out there
who are trying

31:47.296 --> 31:50.256
to persevere in the face

we invite you to COPE.

Hello again.

31:56.001 --> 31:58.177
You look like you have
a question.

31:58.220 --> 32:00.179
Yeah, hi. I-I was here

32:00.222 --> 32:02.181
the other day, and I, um,
I-I was so moved

32:02.224 --> 32:05.488
I had to come back
and find out more.

32:05.532 --> 32:06.794
That happens a lot.

32:06.837 --> 32:08.404
Welcome.

32:08.448 --> 32:09.666
S How do I,

32:09.710 --> 32:11.712
how do I, how do I
be a part of this?

32:11.755 --> 32:13.714
Just your presence
is all that's required.

32:13.757 --> 32:15.672
Oh, and your acceptance.

32:15.716 --> 32:16.673
I totally accept.

32:16.717 --> 32:17.892
So wh

32:17.936 --> 32:20.851
Have you tried unburdening?

32:20.895 --> 32:21.983
No, but I've heard
of it.

32:22.027 --> 32:23.419
It's what our members do

32:23.463 --> 32:24.855
to show that they've
truly accepted,

32:24.899 --> 32:27.162
by letting go.

32:27.206 --> 32:28.685
LIAM:
Letting go of what?

32:28.729 --> 32:30.470
NORA:
Whatever's holding them back.

32:30.513 --> 32:32.994
That guy's handing over
his car keys.

32:33.038 --> 32:35.518
You, you telling me
his Honda's holding him back?

32:35.562 --> 32:38.086
He's not gonna need
a car in the end.

32:38.130 --> 32:40.610
What

32:40.654 --> 32:42.221
Theend.

32:42.264 --> 32:45.006
We all know it's coming,
but we've accepted it.

32:49.837 --> 32:52.927
You carry a notebook with a
quote from Asimov on the cover.

32:52.971 --> 32:54.798
"Ideas die hard."

32:54.842 --> 32:56.800

other questions?

Thank you.

Ladies and gentlemen,

33:01.980 --> 33:03.894
if I could have
your attention, please.

33:03.938 --> 33:05.896
Just for a few moments.

33:05.940 --> 33:08.116
If you could all gather round.
Thank you.

33:08.160 --> 33:10.814
I would like to take
this opportunity

33:10.858 --> 33:12.947
to make a special announcement.

33:12.991 --> 33:15.689
Since you're the ones investing
in the future of my presidency,

33:15.732 --> 33:18.735
it's only fair that you're the
first to meet the team that will

33:18.779 --> 33:20.781
continue to lead
this great nation

33:20.824 --> 33:23.610
when we win the next election.

33:23.653 --> 33:27.744
Please join me
in extending a warm welcome

33:27.788 --> 33:33.576
to the next vice president
of the United States,

33:33.620 --> 33:35.839
Congressman Trey Thompson.

33:37.798 --> 33:39.321
Congressman, come up here.

33:43.804 --> 33:45.762
What the hell, Roland?

33:45.806 --> 33:48.896
I-I had no idea, I swear, I...

34:02.823 --> 34:04.781
We're gonna need
a sit-down, Mr. President.

34:04.825 --> 34:07.697
Plenty of time for that,
Mr. Vice President.

34:19.144 --> 34:21.146
Mr. President.

34:22.495 --> 34:23.844
It's a great day for America.

34:23.887 --> 34:26.151
Congratulations.Congratulations.

34:26.194 --> 34:28.022
Congratulations,
Mr. President.

34:29.110 --> 34:30.981
Nephew.

34:31.025 --> 34:33.984
I'd like a word, please.

34:47.694 --> 34:49.696
Well?

34:51.001 --> 34:52.960
You made a mistake.

34:53.003 --> 34:55.832
But it's not one
that can't be undone.

34:55.876 --> 34:58.661
I'm not undoing anything.Hmm.

34:58.705 --> 35:01.229
Senator Gitlow's
in your pocket, isn't he?

35:01.273 --> 35:03.405
Hmm.

35:06.191 --> 35:08.018
I know what you did, Uncle.

35:08.062 --> 35:10.020
All of it: coups,

35:10.064 --> 35:14.112
assassinations, sabotage
of my Ark, if I'm not mistaken.

35:14.155 --> 35:15.896
Your Ark?

35:15.939 --> 35:19.987
Yeah? When did you get the right
to decide who lives and dies?

35:20.030 --> 35:24.426
80 of those seats are mine,
and the going rate is steep.

35:24.470 --> 35:28.256
I'm gonna use all the power
of the presidency to destroy you

35:28.300 --> 35:31.564
and your filthy cabal.

35:33.609 --> 35:35.872
You think you got power?

35:35.916 --> 35:37.744
No.

35:37.787 --> 35:39.528
Money rules the world, Darius.

35:39.572 --> 35:41.095
It always has.

35:41.139 --> 35:43.184
Not governments
and not presidents.

35:43.228 --> 35:46.448
Why do you think you're here?

35:46.492 --> 35:48.537
We put you here.

35:48.581 --> 35:50.278
Hmm?

35:50.322 --> 35:51.758
You belong to us.

35:51.801 --> 35:54.935
You killed Mackenzie.

35:54.978 --> 35:57.807
Do you think you got here
by your genius alone?

35:57.851 --> 36:01.333
You had help from allies you
didn't even know existed.

36:01.376 --> 36:03.030
You're engineered for success.

36:05.380 --> 36:07.774
You say you're not like us.

36:07.817 --> 36:10.690
But you've always
been one of us.

36:21.918 --> 36:23.398
12 matches.

36:23.442 --> 36:24.878
That's a pretty damn good
showing for one night.

36:24.921 --> 36:27.576
Mm-hmm. Ghosts no more.

36:27.620 --> 36:29.926
So what now?HARRIS:
Use every resource

36:29.970 --> 36:31.319
at our disposal to
find the other five,

36:31.363 --> 36:33.626
and then we choke off
the money supply.

36:35.062 --> 36:36.063
Darius?

36:40.154 --> 36:43.331
As of tomorrow, we're on them.

36:43.375 --> 36:46.204
Their businesses, finances.
We'll hunt

36:46.247 --> 36:48.293
each and every one down--
every last one--

36:48.336 --> 36:51.252
until they're finished.

37:04.700 --> 37:08.138
Care to explain
your little theatrics tonight?

37:09.966 --> 37:12.055
I'm a showman at heart.

37:12.099 --> 37:15.058
You nearly broke
Senator Gitlow's.

37:15.102 --> 37:16.538
Why'd you pick me?

37:16.582 --> 37:19.976
What's your game, Mr. President?

37:20.020 --> 37:21.978
This is no game, Congressman.

37:22.022 --> 37:24.764
This is deadly serious business.

37:24.807 --> 37:27.419
I know you have
a low opinion of my character,

37:27.462 --> 37:30.291
but the feeling
isn't mutual.

37:30.335 --> 37:33.033
The person a heartbeat away
from the presidency must be

37:33.076 --> 37:37.994
a decent human being
who values the Constitution.

37:38.038 --> 37:40.127
And you're a good man.

37:40.170 --> 37:43.478
An annoying,
judgmental one, but...

37:43.522 --> 37:45.437
good, nonetheless.

37:45.480 --> 37:47.656
I appreciate your honesty.

37:47.700 --> 37:50.093
So what do you say?

37:50.137 --> 37:51.573
You up to it?

37:51.617 --> 37:52.966
Under one condition.

37:53.009 --> 37:55.098
We clean house of all
dirty business on both sides.

37:55.142 --> 37:58.145
Everything is played
above board and by the book.

37:58.188 --> 38:00.974
No special treatment
of anyone. None.

38:02.018 --> 38:03.846
Deal.

38:05.761 --> 38:07.807
Not even Ms. Barrows' father.

38:26.216 --> 38:30.699
WHITEHAIR:
Sir. How'd it go?

38:30.743 --> 38:33.006
A minor setback.

38:33.049 --> 38:38.359
But you know...
we always prevail.

38:39.534 --> 38:40.927
Anything I can do?

38:40.970 --> 38:43.233
Not yet.

38:43.277 --> 38:45.714
But soon.

38:51.024 --> 38:54.375
So what now, Mr. Secretary?

38:54.419 --> 38:57.247
FBI's looking into
the people we ID'd.

38:57.291 --> 38:59.032
We'll fill out the list,

38:59.075 --> 39:00.816
pursue this to the fullest
extent of the law,

39:00.860 --> 39:02.078
starting with money laundering

39:02.122 --> 39:03.341
and fraud.

39:03.384 --> 39:06.126
Money laundering

39:06.169 --> 39:08.128
Not
Treason?

39:08.171 --> 39:10.130
You know how these things go.

39:10.173 --> 39:11.784
Slowly but surely.

39:11.827 --> 39:14.613
We don't have time for slowly.

39:14.656 --> 39:18.399
No, we don't.

39:18.443 --> 39:21.054
Which is why I'd like
to bring you in.

39:24.449 --> 39:28.409
How far you prepared to go?

39:28.453 --> 39:33.066
Those pricks sent
Fiona Lane into my orbit,

39:33.109 --> 39:37.157
destroyed this country,
murdered my son.

39:41.596 --> 39:45.383
I'm prepared to go all the way.

39:49.778 --> 39:54.043
My sister was part of this mess.

39:54.087 --> 39:56.394
Least I can do
is help clean it up.

39:58.483 --> 40:00.789
To justice.

40:00.833 --> 40:03.923
I'll drink to that.

40:11.887 --> 40:13.628
GRACE: If it hadn't been
for my father,

40:13.672 --> 40:17.066
Monroe Bennett would
be president right now.I know.

40:17.110 --> 40:18.764
My father doesn't
belong in prison.

40:18.807 --> 40:20.418
I know.

40:21.941 --> 40:24.857
So what spooked you
at the party?

40:26.032 --> 40:28.556
Hey. What did
your uncle say to you?

40:28.600 --> 40:31.298
These people are more dangerous
than I ever could have imagined.

40:31.341 --> 40:35.302
I can't walk away
until Q-17 has been dismantled.

40:35.345 --> 40:38.218
I have to put out
this fire permanently.

40:38.261 --> 40:39.567
Until another one flares up.

40:39.611 --> 40:41.569
There will always be
another emergency,

40:41.613 --> 40:43.919
another catastrophe,
another... asteroid.

40:43.963 --> 40:46.487
And you will always
need to fix it.

40:46.531 --> 40:48.924
I'm the Manchurian candidate.

40:48.968 --> 40:50.491
What? What are you
talking about?

40:50.535 --> 40:55.888
They killed Mackenzie
so I'd be president.

40:55.931 --> 40:58.325
Oh, my God.

40:58.368 --> 40:59.457
Why?

40:59.500 --> 41:03.678
They, they-they think
I'm one of them.

41:03.722 --> 41:08.117
And I'm gonna do everything
in my power to prove them wrong.

41:08.161 --> 41:10.380
I can't pardon
your father right now.

41:10.424 --> 41:12.121
I can't blur
the lines anymore.

41:12.165 --> 41:13.601
I have to do
this right.

41:13.645 --> 41:15.516
I'm sorry.

41:15.560 --> 41:17.953
I'm sorry.

41:24.003 --> 41:29.530
: For one brief
moment, we took the victory.

41:37.190 --> 41:38.844
GRACE:
Liam?

41:38.887 --> 41:42.195
What are you doing here?I'm sorry to interrupt.

41:42.238 --> 41:45.067
Have you seen Jillian?
She hasn't returned my calls.

41:45.111 --> 41:46.591
Please tell me she's here.No. I-I thought

41:46.634 --> 41:48.810
she was with you.
She hasn't slept here in days.

41:48.854 --> 41:50.377
She called in sick today.
What's going on?

41:50.420 --> 41:51.987
I don't know. Uh...

41:52.031 --> 41:53.380
She's in with these people,

41:53.423 --> 41:55.382
and they've got
her head messed up.

41:55.425 --> 41:58.385
Liam, Jillian's a smart woman.
I'm sure she's...

41:58.428 --> 42:00.213
No, you don't
understand.

42:00.256 --> 42:03.085
This group, COPE?
I think they're a suicide cult.

42:04.260 --> 42:05.566
Look, they're gonna
kill themselves

42:05.610 --> 42:07.307
and Jillian's with them.

42:07.350 --> 42:10.092
BASS:
You've accepted, unburdened.

42:10.136 --> 42:13.487
You've learned to cope
with what is and what shall be.

42:13.531 --> 42:15.489
And I'm thrilled to tell you
that you are being elevated

42:15.533 --> 42:18.840
to a very special group.

42:18.884 --> 42:23.584
You have been chosen...
for salvation.

42:29.982 --> 42:32.288
Are you ready?

42:32.332 --> 42:34.508
Yes.
