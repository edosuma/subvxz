WEBVTT

01:02.938 --> 01:04.231
You guys psyched
for Death Castle?

01:04.315 --> 01:05.399
Oh, yeah, baby.

01:05.483 --> 01:07.401
I hear there's a crazy
twist at the end.

01:07.485 --> 01:08.819
What the fuck did you
tell me that for?

01:08.903 --> 01:10.279
Yeah, what the hell, Arnold?

01:10.362 --> 01:13.199
What are you talking about? I
didn't tell you what the twist was.

01:13.282 --> 01:14.909
Now I'm gonna be
expecting a twist.

01:14.992 --> 01:17.953
For real. Narrative
immersion-- ruined.

01:18.037 --> 01:21.499
Wow. I never really considered
that perspective on twists.

01:21.582 --> 01:23.250
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay, buddy.

01:23.334 --> 01:26.962
I don't understand this new
political-correctness shit.

01:27.046 --> 01:28.506
"Native Americans."

01:28.589 --> 01:31.258
Why don't they just call them
"Indians" the way they used to?

01:31.342 --> 01:33.177
I think it's because they prefer
the term "Native Americans."

01:33.260 --> 01:35.262
Well, I like saying "Indians."

01:35.346 --> 01:37.056
This guy used to fix my car.

01:37.139 --> 01:39.433
I called him "Injun Larry."

01:39.517 --> 01:40.601
He loved it.

01:40.684 --> 01:42.103
Hi, Diego.

01:42.186 --> 01:46.315
Oh, do I hear a radio?

01:46.398 --> 01:48.943
Turn off that radio, Eddie.

01:49.026 --> 01:50.236
You know it's not allowed.

01:50.319 --> 01:51.362
Yes, ma'am.

01:51.445 --> 01:54.532
And no more eating mangoes
behind the desk, please.

01:54.615 --> 01:56.408
Once again, ma'am,
I've never done that.

01:56.492 --> 01:58.035
I don't even like
tropical fruits.

01:58.119 --> 01:59.745
- Yeah.
- Maybe it was one of the other doormen.

01:59.829 --> 02:01.122
Oh, sure.

02:08.754 --> 02:10.548
Hello, Mr. Reeves.

02:11.924 --> 02:13.175
Good morning, Mrs. Thompson.

02:13.259 --> 02:14.760
Little Cody.

02:16.345 --> 02:17.346
Mr. Marco.

02:17.429 --> 02:18.514
Love that purple jacket.

02:18.597 --> 02:19.765
Thanks, Eddie.

02:26.021 --> 02:28.524
Yes, absolutely. I'll
take care of it.

02:32.069 --> 02:34.238
Hey, Eddie, how
those Mets doing?

02:34.321 --> 02:36.323
Eh, we can't hit.
You know how it is.

02:36.407 --> 02:37.491
Oh, I hear that.

02:37.575 --> 02:39.034
Listen, um,

02:39.118 --> 02:42.496
we're gonna go upstairs
for just a little bit.

02:42.580 --> 02:44.498
Would you do me a favor
and give me a ring

02:44.582 --> 02:47.459
if the missus shows up?

02:47.543 --> 02:48.919
Yes, sir.

02:49.003 --> 02:53.048
Thank you. Appreciate
it very much.

02:57.261 --> 02:59.013
Right this way.

03:01.390 --> 03:02.349
Mr. Wiest.

03:02.433 --> 03:04.143
Miss Jenkins.

03:04.226 --> 03:06.478
Mr. Delfino.

03:06.562 --> 03:08.480
Mr. Marco.

03:08.564 --> 03:10.232
Still looking good.

03:15.821 --> 03:17.072
Florence, what's up?

03:17.156 --> 03:19.283
Eddie, I have a favor
to ask of you.

03:19.366 --> 03:20.367
Anything. What is it?

03:20.451 --> 03:22.286
I have to go upstate tonight.

03:22.369 --> 03:24.914
My dad choked on some
raisins this morning,

03:24.997 --> 03:26.415
and he's a bit shaken up.

03:26.498 --> 03:29.668
Can you give my little
Frank his medicine?

03:29.752 --> 03:31.337
Absolutely. I'm real
good with pets.

03:31.420 --> 03:33.589
Now, keep in mind, only
Frank is diabetic.

03:33.672 --> 03:34.924
Diana is fine.

03:35.007 --> 03:36.300
The way you can tell them apart

03:36.383 --> 03:38.385
is that Diana has more
of a sense of humor,

03:38.469 --> 03:40.596
and Frank is more
of an intellectual.

03:40.679 --> 03:41.680
Okay.

03:41.764 --> 03:44.225
And if you give the medicine
to Diana, she will go insane.

03:44.308 --> 03:45.851
I'm running late. I got to go.

03:45.935 --> 03:47.519
- Thanks, Eddie.
- What?

03:49.146 --> 03:51.106
Great time, buddy.

03:51.190 --> 03:52.024
Tag out.

03:56.028 --> 03:57.613
She's driving me crazy, man.

03:57.696 --> 03:59.823
She rearranged everything
in my kitchen.

03:59.907 --> 04:01.659
Took me 20 minutes
to find a spoon.

04:01.742 --> 04:03.827
By that time, I didn't
even want the pudding.

04:03.911 --> 04:06.121
Let's ask Eddie.

04:06.205 --> 04:08.374
Ramon's mother-in-law
just moved in with him.

04:08.457 --> 04:10.167
You got yours in
your house, right?

04:10.251 --> 04:12.962
And my mom. It's a lot, man.

04:13.045 --> 04:14.755
How do you handle that?

04:14.838 --> 04:16.715
You know, I'm trying
to do the right thing.

04:16.799 --> 04:18.634
She getting a little older
now, so we took her in.

04:18.717 --> 04:20.886
But now she's all
up in my business.

04:20.970 --> 04:22.972
I'm not accustomed to this shit.

04:23.055 --> 04:24.640
This is What I did.

04:24.723 --> 04:27.768
I got them each their own TV.
Put them in their rooms.

04:27.851 --> 04:29.770
Got one of those
streaming boxes.

04:29.853 --> 04:31.355
We get all the Spanish channels.

04:31.438 --> 04:33.065
They're sitting
in there all day.

04:33.148 --> 04:34.650
They're in heaven. I
basically never see them.

04:34.733 --> 04:36.068
It's great.

04:36.151 --> 04:38.404
Actually, that sounds
like a good idea.

04:38.487 --> 04:40.030
Or you can do what
white people do.

04:40.114 --> 04:41.949
Get her an apartment
in this building...

04:42.032 --> 04:43.951
and never visit.

04:44.034 --> 04:45.411
- True.
- It's true, man.

04:45.494 --> 04:47.830
Last month when I found Mrs.
Donovan--

04:47.913 --> 04:50.124
RIP, Mrs. D--

04:50.207 --> 04:51.709
all of her nieces
and nephews started

04:51.792 --> 04:54.044
coming out of the woodwork,
trying to get her stuff.

04:54.128 --> 04:56.130
I'm like, "Where you been
at for the last ten years?"

04:56.213 --> 04:58.841
One of them was like, "What's
up with that piano?"

04:58.924 --> 05:01.051
Come on, man, you never
even saw this lady.

05:01.135 --> 05:02.386
That's fucked up.

05:02.469 --> 05:04.888
I mean, why do people do that?

05:04.972 --> 05:06.515
You do that to your moms, Ryan?

05:06.598 --> 05:08.517
Nah, man, she made
a bunch of money

05:08.600 --> 05:10.728
'cause she got sick on a
cruise and sued the company.

05:10.811 --> 05:12.187
She's set for life.

05:12.229 --> 05:13.647
How'd she get sick?

05:13.731 --> 05:16.108
I don't know. I think she
got diarrhea or something.

05:16.817 --> 05:19.028
You can't sue because
you got diarrhea.

05:19.111 --> 05:21.155
Tell that to her beach house.

05:33.125 --> 05:35.627
I got to run upstairs for a second.
Can you cover me?

05:35.711 --> 05:37.046
Thanks.

05:43.802 --> 05:46.430
Damn it, Flo.

05:46.513 --> 05:48.265
Which one of you
is the smart one?

05:49.892 --> 05:51.810
Jesus Christ, this is insane.

05:54.063 --> 05:55.939
Hey, Flo, I could use your help.

05:56.023 --> 05:59.151
Which bird is Frank?

05:59.234 --> 06:00.402
Yellow head?

06:00.486 --> 06:02.404
Okay, all right. Thanks, Flo.

06:03.781 --> 06:07.076
Could have told me that before.

06:07.159 --> 06:09.745
Flo... kind of slow...

06:09.828 --> 06:11.789
with the info.

06:11.872 --> 06:13.957
There you go.

06:14.041 --> 06:15.626
What are you doing?

06:15.709 --> 06:17.503
- Oh, my God. Are you crazy?
- Get the--

06:20.589 --> 06:22.716
Damn, that ain't good.

06:33.060 --> 06:34.186
Eddie, Eddie.

06:34.269 --> 06:36.021
I told you to call the
room if she was coming.

06:36.105 --> 06:37.564
I'm sorry, sir. Someone
else was covering the desk

06:37.648 --> 06:38.899
while I helped another resident.

06:38.982 --> 06:41.443
I don't care what you were doing.
You had one job to do!

06:41.527 --> 06:44.113
Actually, sir, I have many
different jobs for many people.

06:44.196 --> 06:45.614
- I'm sorry for whatever happened.
- You're sorry?

06:45.697 --> 06:46.698
You're sorry for what happened?

06:46.782 --> 06:48.742
All my shit is out
there on the street!

06:48.826 --> 06:50.202
Again, I apologize.

06:50.285 --> 06:51.537
I wasn't at the desk.

06:51.620 --> 06:52.538
Where the fuck were you, then?

06:52.621 --> 06:54.039
With all due respect, sir,

06:54.123 --> 06:55.290
you're responsible for
your own actions.

06:55.374 --> 06:57.751
If you don't walk away right
now, we're gonna have a problem.

07:04.550 --> 07:06.885
Watch it with the pointing.

07:10.597 --> 07:12.266
Oh, good. Hi.

07:12.349 --> 07:14.351
I think I left my
headphones up there.

07:14.435 --> 07:16.228
Do you think you could just
run up and grab them for me?

07:16.311 --> 07:18.147
No, I'm not gonna
do that, ma'am.

07:18.230 --> 07:19.940
Oh, they're Beats by Dre.

07:20.023 --> 07:21.608
They're very expensive.

07:21.692 --> 07:23.402
Well, maybe they'll end
up out in the street

07:23.485 --> 07:25.279
with the rest of Mr.
Strickland's stuff.

07:26.238 --> 07:28.323
God. Whatever.

07:35.205 --> 07:37.332
Yo, dude, you been outside?

07:38.375 --> 07:40.419
Whole bunch of nice
clothes out there, man.

07:40.502 --> 07:43.422
I'm talking Louis,
Gucci, Margiela.

07:45.966 --> 07:47.509
What do you think
of this jacket?

07:49.261 --> 07:51.805
I think you looking
good, my friend.

07:51.889 --> 07:53.056
It's my lucky day.

07:53.140 --> 07:54.183
You know what?

07:54.266 --> 07:56.560
Hold on to this. I
got to celebrate.

07:56.643 --> 07:58.937
I'm gonna go to la bodega
and get some mangoes.

07:58.979 --> 08:01.607
- You need anything?
- No, I'm good.

08:01.690 --> 08:04.276
'Cause I'm going in
my nice new jacket.

08:04.359 --> 08:06.195
Ha ha. My man.

08:08.655 --> 08:09.698
Cabrera's running.

08:09.781 --> 08:11.950
Lined into left field.
That's a base hit.

08:12.034 --> 08:13.827
Pederson's gonna
hustle over there...

08:17.956 --> 08:20.209
God damn it!

08:20.292 --> 08:22.294
No, no, no, no!

08:22.377 --> 08:23.504
No!

16:44.921 --> 16:46.214
Where are we going?

16:46.297 --> 16:47.465
Spring and Lafayette.

16:53.096 --> 16:55.223
The movie may be
called Death Castle,

16:55.306 --> 16:58.184
but in my opinion, it's filled
with a whole lot of life.

16:58.268 --> 17:00.603
I say, lower that drawbridge

17:00.687 --> 17:03.064
and get thee to your
nearest theater.

17:03.148 --> 17:06.067
I'm Sandy Kenyon with the
Eyewitness News' "Movie Minute."

17:06.151 --> 17:07.777
- Have you seen Death Castle yet?
- Yes.

17:07.861 --> 17:10.321
- How crazy is that twist?
- I never saw it coming.

17:10.405 --> 17:11.573
Let me make sure I
got this right.

17:11.656 --> 17:14.034
The black guy was really
Nicolas Cage the whole time?

17:14.117 --> 17:15.744
Yeah, and the castle was heaven.

17:15.827 --> 17:18.163
- Yes.
- I know. It was insane.

17:18.246 --> 17:19.956
- Tyrese was so good.
- So good.

17:20.040 --> 17:21.916
- You know he's my favorite.
- Yeah, girl.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.376
How good was Emma Watson?
I love...

17:45.940 --> 17:47.776
Have you been to Lauren's
new grain bowl place?

17:47.859 --> 17:49.402
Yeah, the-- Yeah,
grain bowl, when--

17:49.486 --> 17:51.029
I had the one with
the grilled chicken

17:51.112 --> 17:53.198
and the avocado and the farro.

19:07.939 --> 19:09.524
- Bonjour.
- Morning.

19:10.942 --> 19:12.735
- Bonjour.
- Morning.

19:12.819 --> 19:15.155
The kitchen sink is clogged.
Don't use it.

19:15.238 --> 19:16.531
Again?

19:16.614 --> 19:18.074
I told Junior not
to shave in there.

19:18.158 --> 19:19.659
That's what the
bathroom is there for.

19:19.742 --> 19:21.327
Bro, I've told him
that a thousand times.

19:21.411 --> 19:22.579
You want to help me clean it?

19:22.662 --> 19:24.497
No, I'm tired. I'm going to bed.

19:24.581 --> 19:25.582
Get some rest, bro.

19:25.665 --> 19:27.000
Good night.

19:39.470 --> 19:40.847
What the hell, Junior?

19:40.930 --> 19:43.141
Why are you dropping
french fries on my head?

19:43.224 --> 19:46.102
Sorry. They're so good. I
can't stop eating them.

19:46.186 --> 19:47.645
I got a cheeseburger, too.

19:47.729 --> 19:49.564
Why can't you just eat
in the living room?

19:49.647 --> 19:51.482
It's my bedroom, too.

19:51.566 --> 19:53.401
Plus, I'm more comfortable here.

19:54.819 --> 19:56.905
Just eat quietly, man.

20:04.120 --> 20:05.455
Sorry.

20:24.265 --> 20:25.934
Dude, Watson,

20:26.017 --> 20:27.644
why are you wearing that shirt?

20:27.727 --> 20:28.853
We're going to a nice club.

20:28.978 --> 20:30.438
Don't you get it? It's so funny.

20:30.521 --> 20:31.689
The girls are going to love it.

20:31.773 --> 20:33.650
"Toadally smashed."

20:33.733 --> 20:35.193
The toad is being
smashed by the word.

20:37.737 --> 20:40.573
You guys are wasting your
money going to clubs.

20:40.657 --> 20:42.242
You should be saving up like me.

20:42.325 --> 20:43.993
Saving up for what?

20:44.077 --> 20:47.914
I want to own a Dairy Queen
franchise in South Florida.

20:47.997 --> 20:49.749
It's sunny every day there.

20:49.832 --> 20:51.584
I'm gonna go to my shop,

20:51.668 --> 20:53.002
have an ice cream,

20:53.086 --> 20:54.879
then I just eat it at the beach.

20:54.963 --> 20:56.172
Come on, man.

20:56.256 --> 20:57.298
Eat ice cream every day?

20:57.382 --> 20:58.508
That's your fantasy?

20:58.591 --> 20:59.968
What are you, five years old?

21:00.051 --> 21:01.636
You can have ice cream now.

21:01.719 --> 21:03.346
But at my shop, I
get it for free.

21:03.429 --> 21:05.682
- Hey, Jameson?
- Yes?

21:05.765 --> 21:07.392
You sure this place
we're going to is good?

21:07.475 --> 21:08.810
Yeah, man.

21:08.893 --> 21:10.311
I drop off beautiful women

21:10.436 --> 21:11.980
and cool guys there
all the time.

21:12.063 --> 21:13.982
I took Keanu Reeves
there last week.

21:14.065 --> 21:15.275
Keanu Reeves?

21:15.358 --> 21:17.485
You never had Keanu
Reeves in your cab.

21:17.568 --> 21:19.529
He's so rich. He
probably uses Uber.

21:19.612 --> 21:21.406
No, it was him, I swear.

21:21.489 --> 21:22.740
Mm, Watson,

21:22.824 --> 21:24.909
who's the most famous person
you ever had in your cab?

21:24.993 --> 21:26.077
Mariah Carey.

21:26.160 --> 21:27.453
Bullshit!

21:27.537 --> 21:28.454
That's bullshit.

21:28.538 --> 21:30.290
For real, she was sitting
in the back of the car,

21:30.373 --> 21:31.916
singing along with the radio.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.501
I could recognize
that voice anywhere.

21:33.584 --> 21:35.253
Okay. Who else you got?

21:35.336 --> 21:37.839
The other day, I took, uh...

21:37.922 --> 21:39.507
the guy from Seinfeld.

21:39.590 --> 21:41.134
Jerry Seinfeld?

21:41.217 --> 21:43.261
No, wait. His name is
Jerry in real life?

21:43.344 --> 21:44.721
Yeah.

21:44.804 --> 21:45.847
Oh, no, that wasn't him.

21:45.930 --> 21:47.473
This guy's name was Ronald.

21:47.557 --> 21:48.766
He was funny, though.

21:48.850 --> 21:50.393
He-- He gave me a big tip.

21:50.476 --> 21:52.061
Look at this guy.

21:52.103 --> 21:54.147
Bragging about picking
up Ronald Seinfeld.

21:55.231 --> 21:56.524
Who you gonna pick up next?

21:56.607 --> 21:58.151
Eric Schwarzenegger?

22:09.412 --> 22:10.955
This is going to be incredible.

22:11.039 --> 22:13.041
It better be. We've been
waiting for two hours.

22:13.124 --> 22:14.584
You three...

22:14.667 --> 22:16.753
No. Next.

22:16.836 --> 22:19.130
What? We've been
waiting forever.

22:19.213 --> 22:21.215
I can't let two guys and
their dad in with no women.

22:21.299 --> 22:23.134
Hey, I'm nobody's dad.

22:23.217 --> 22:27.013
"Toadally smashed."

22:27.096 --> 22:29.223
Come on, man, get out of here.

22:30.266 --> 22:33.186
I told you to take
that stupid shirt off.

22:33.269 --> 22:34.562
Ah...

22:34.645 --> 22:36.981
- "Toadally smashed."
- You guys looking for a club?

22:37.065 --> 22:39.192
- Yeah.
- Oh, man, I got the place.

22:39.275 --> 22:40.568
Tons of girls, great music.

22:40.651 --> 22:42.403
Only 20 bucks a head
with that flyer.

22:43.321 --> 22:45.114
Envision.

22:45.198 --> 22:47.367
- Thank you. Let's go.
- Thank you, man.

22:47.450 --> 22:49.452
You the man. Thank
you very much.

22:54.082 --> 22:55.208
This place is empty.

22:55.291 --> 22:56.959
What the fuck?

22:57.043 --> 22:58.795
There are no girls here.

22:58.878 --> 23:00.713
There are barely
even any guys here.

23:00.797 --> 23:02.215
Where the hell is the bartender?

23:03.925 --> 23:06.552
They're playing the song from
the Six Flag commercial.

23:06.636 --> 23:08.638
Do you guys want bottle service?

23:08.721 --> 23:10.681
We got to get bottle
service, man.

23:10.765 --> 23:11.682
We saved up for months.

23:11.766 --> 23:12.975
You're right.

23:13.059 --> 23:14.394
How much is a bottle of vodka?

23:14.477 --> 23:15.603
$800.

23:15.686 --> 23:17.188
Eight-hundred dollars?

23:17.271 --> 23:18.439
Huh?

23:23.694 --> 23:25.029
I told you we shouldn't
go to that club.

23:25.113 --> 23:27.240
No, you didn't. You're the
one who said we should go.

23:27.323 --> 23:29.325
Man, I'm never going out
with you guys again.

23:29.409 --> 23:30.785
Come on!

23:30.868 --> 23:32.537
Please, open up!

23:32.620 --> 23:35.081
We just want some fries!
We'll be really quick.

23:35.164 --> 23:36.916
Yo, that's
where Junior works.

23:36.999 --> 23:38.126
Yeah.

23:43.965 --> 23:45.508
Hey, dummy!

23:45.591 --> 23:47.844
Come on, open up!

23:51.973 --> 23:53.057
Yeah, girl!

23:54.725 --> 23:57.311
And then we got to the second
club, and nobody was there.

23:57.395 --> 23:59.647
Oh, yeah, Envision
is always dead.

23:59.730 --> 24:02.483
The last time we went there, they
were playing the Six Flags song.

24:02.567 --> 24:03.443
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

24:03.526 --> 24:05.027
What song is that?

24:05.111 --> 24:06.446
"Vengabus."

24:06.529 --> 24:07.947
♪ Bah-bah-bah-bah-bah, bah-bah ♪

24:11.200 --> 24:12.535
Oh, my God, Kelly!

24:12.618 --> 24:14.328
Did you see his shirt?

24:14.412 --> 24:15.538
"Toadally smashed."

24:15.621 --> 24:17.457
I love it!

24:17.540 --> 24:19.125
My nephew has the same shirt.

24:19.208 --> 24:20.126
Told you guys.

24:23.504 --> 24:25.590
God, we need some drinks, guys.

24:25.673 --> 24:26.591
- Yeah.
- Yes, please.

24:26.674 --> 24:28.843
I'm still bummed we couldn't
get bottle service.

24:28.926 --> 24:31.053
Man, you never had
$800 in your life.

24:31.137 --> 24:34.223
- What are you talking about?
- I make more tips than you.

24:34.307 --> 24:36.767
This guy drove for Uber last year.
His rating was 1.8.

24:36.851 --> 24:38.478
They won't let him drive again.

24:40.396 --> 24:42.648
Bottle service!

24:45.735 --> 24:48.654
Hey, guys. Guys!

24:48.738 --> 24:50.323
I just got a phone call.

24:50.406 --> 24:52.200
And I have some terrible news.

24:52.283 --> 24:53.618
- What's going on?
- What happened?

24:53.701 --> 24:55.161
- What's up?
- Do we need to leave?

24:55.244 --> 24:56.746
No.

24:56.829 --> 24:59.415
"The Vengabus" is coming.

25:15.515 --> 25:17.725
This was so much fun,
you guys.

25:17.808 --> 25:20.186
Um, where you headed now?

25:20.311 --> 25:23.689
Um, I don't know. We'll
go wherever you guys go.

25:23.773 --> 25:26.275
Well... I'm not tired yet.

25:26.359 --> 25:27.527
I know.

25:27.610 --> 25:29.820
Is there something
else we could do?

25:31.030 --> 25:32.448
Death Castle's playing!

25:32.532 --> 25:34.408
We have to go.
I've heard it's amazing.

25:34.492 --> 25:37.453
- I love Nicolas Cage.
- Me too.

25:44.293 --> 25:47.880
DeShawn? DeShawn?

25:50.049 --> 25:51.342
Uh, DeShawn, are you up there?

25:53.803 --> 25:55.304
DeShawn, is that you?

25:56.305 --> 25:57.139
Troy?

25:57.223 --> 25:58.516
That's right.

25:58.599 --> 26:01.727
- There is no DeShawn Townsend.
- What's happening?

26:01.811 --> 26:04.772
Only me, Troy Avery.

26:04.855 --> 26:05.690
No.

26:05.773 --> 26:09.193
Troy Avery is DeShawn Townsend.

26:10.319 --> 26:12.530
What? What? What?

26:12.613 --> 26:14.323
Man, I'm straight
shook right now.

26:14.407 --> 26:15.908
I knew there was a twist,
but not like this.

26:15.992 --> 26:16.993
This is crazy.

26:17.076 --> 26:17.994
Sorry.
