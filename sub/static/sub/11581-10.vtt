NARRATOR:
In the criminal justice system,

00:03.837 --> 00:07.108
sexually based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:07.141 --> 00:09.277
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:09.310 --> 00:11.279
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:11.312 --> 00:12.613
are members of an elite squad

00:12.646 --> 00:14.448
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:14.482 --> 00:17.785
These are their stories.

00:17.818 --> 00:19.487
Good nannies
are hard to find.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.822
Mrs. Endsley offered
to double my salary

00:21.855 --> 00:23.357
if I went to work for her.

00:23.391 --> 00:25.359
Lucy, go play
with the other kids.

00:25.393 --> 00:28.362
And keep your jacket on,
I'm not telling you again!

00:28.396 --> 00:31.232
Of course I told her, I couldn't
possibly leave little Jack.

00:31.265 --> 00:32.133
He's devoted to me.

00:32.166 --> 00:34.068
Give me her number,
I'll take the job.

00:34.102 --> 00:36.737
She's looking for someone with
more training and experience.

00:36.770 --> 00:38.806
I can't work for
Mrs. Prichard anymore.

00:38.839 --> 00:41.175
Lucy is driving me nuts.
She never obeys me.

00:41.209 --> 00:43.511
That's because her mother
spoils her rotten.

00:43.544 --> 00:45.213
Have you tried using time-outs?

00:45.246 --> 00:46.580
Mrs. Prichard won't let me.

00:46.614 --> 00:48.649
She says it will stunt
Lucy's creativity.

00:48.682 --> 00:50.118
Nonsense.

00:50.151 --> 00:52.120
I keep telling you,
children need limits.

00:52.153 --> 00:54.222
Call her over, I'll show you
how to handle her.

00:54.255 --> 00:56.124
Lucy.

00:56.157 --> 00:58.692
Lucy?

00:58.726 --> 01:00.361
I don't see her.

01:00.394 --> 01:03.331
Lucy! Lucy, where are you?!

01:03.364 --> 01:05.233
Lucy!

01:05.266 --> 01:06.667
Missing kid is Lucy Prichard.

01:06.700 --> 01:08.669
20 months old, red and pink
jacket, denim jumper.

01:08.702 --> 01:10.238
That's her nanny,
Sarah Rendell.

01:10.271 --> 01:12.273
The older nanny with her
is Veronica Nash.

01:12.306 --> 01:15.143
She says a freak has been
hanging around here the past
couple of days.

01:15.176 --> 01:16.544
Figured if it was
a pedophile snatch,

01:16.577 --> 01:18.546
you guys would want
to get an early heads up.

01:18.579 --> 01:19.547
Okay. Thanks.

01:19.580 --> 01:20.881
Tell the nannies
to stick around.

01:20.914 --> 01:21.715
Where's Olivia?

01:21.749 --> 01:23.717
Emergency hearing
on the Yeager case.

01:23.751 --> 01:26.254
Going to take a few days.
You're stuck with me.

01:26.287 --> 01:28.656
So, you think this is a kidnap
or she just wandered off?

01:28.689 --> 01:30.258
Sounds like the real deal.

01:30.291 --> 01:32.193
You've got a nanny here,
says she saw a creepy guy.

01:32.226 --> 01:34.295
Bushes are a perfect place
for a perv to fantasize.

01:34.328 --> 01:36.664
Hides up here,
lures the kid over

01:36.697 --> 01:39.800
and then carries her off
to a waiting car.

01:39.833 --> 01:41.702
Captain?

01:43.271 --> 01:44.305
Call a bus!

01:44.338 --> 01:45.573
Got it.

01:50.711 --> 01:51.879
Stay with me, sweetheart.

01:51.912 --> 01:53.881
Stay with me.
It's going to be okay.

01:53.914 --> 01:55.249
It's going to be all right.

02:43.831 --> 02:46.300
Lucy's CT shows
intracranial bleeding.

02:46.334 --> 02:47.901
She has a laceration
to the back of her head,

02:47.935 --> 02:49.270
but no skull fracture.

02:49.303 --> 02:50.704
She's on her way to surgery
right now

02:50.738 --> 02:51.839
to reduce the brain swelling.

02:51.872 --> 02:52.973
Did you do a rape kit?

02:53.006 --> 02:55.676
No time, her clothing
was intact.

02:55.709 --> 02:57.578
We did a quick LumaLite,
no semen.

02:57.611 --> 02:59.380
Give me a call
after the surgery, please?

02:59.413 --> 03:00.548
Sure.

03:01.649 --> 03:03.384
I spoke to the mom,
she's on her way.

03:03.417 --> 03:05.853
Works at an ad agency
downtown.

03:05.886 --> 03:07.288
It may take awhile
to get here.

03:07.321 --> 03:08.289
And the dad?

03:08.322 --> 03:09.823
Died last year, heart attack.

03:09.857 --> 03:11.492
Hits just keep coming, huh?

03:11.525 --> 03:14.628
Nanny's in the waiting room.
Let's talk to her.

03:14.662 --> 03:16.630
I only took my eyes off
of her for a moment.

03:16.664 --> 03:18.866
One minute she was playing
and the next she was gone.

03:18.899 --> 03:20.301
We heard about a strange guy

03:20.334 --> 03:21.969
that's been hanging
around the playground.

03:22.002 --> 03:23.437
Did you see him there today?

03:23.471 --> 03:24.672
No, but Veronica did.

03:24.705 --> 03:26.674
She saw him
a couple times before.

03:26.707 --> 03:27.708
Have you?

03:27.741 --> 03:28.742
No.

03:28.776 --> 03:31.879
And I take Lucy to that
playground every day.

03:31.912 --> 03:34.248
STABLER:
Where else do you two go?

03:34.282 --> 03:36.817
Mostly to the park, the zoo,

03:36.850 --> 03:38.752
or the museum if it's raining.

03:38.786 --> 03:41.522
Her mom wants her to get
lots of fresh air.

03:41.555 --> 03:42.856
Anybody ever pay unusual

03:42.890 --> 03:43.924
attention to Lucy?

03:43.957 --> 03:44.725
No.

03:44.758 --> 03:46.860
I see the same people
all the time.

03:46.894 --> 03:47.995
I'd remember any stranger.

03:48.028 --> 03:49.663
Oh, God, Lucy!

03:49.697 --> 03:51.332
STABLER:
Mrs. Prichard.

03:51.365 --> 03:52.766
Evelyn, I am so sorry.

03:52.800 --> 03:53.834
Where's Lucy?

03:53.867 --> 03:55.002
In surgery.

03:55.035 --> 03:56.937
The doctor's are doing
everything they can.

03:56.970 --> 03:59.740
I'm Captain Cragen,
Special Victims.
This is Detective Stabler.

03:59.773 --> 04:00.941
Who did this?

04:00.974 --> 04:02.643
We've just started
our investigation.

04:02.676 --> 04:03.944
Sarah has been
very helpful.

04:03.977 --> 04:05.813
How could you
let this happen?

04:07.748 --> 04:11.018
Sarah, come on,
let's go get some coffee.

04:14.988 --> 04:17.691
What if she's not okay?

04:17.725 --> 04:20.294
Oh, God.

04:20.328 --> 04:23.897
This can't be happening.

04:23.931 --> 04:27.368
I don't know what
I'll do if I lose her.

04:30.003 --> 04:34.775
Why is God punishing me?

04:34.808 --> 04:39.813
I've seen lots of tragedies
that I can't explain.

04:39.847 --> 04:41.949
There's a chapel
in the hospital here.

04:41.982 --> 04:43.584
Sometimes going in can help.

04:43.617 --> 04:45.819
( sniffling )

04:48.756 --> 04:50.424
Elliot, I'll stay
with Evelyn.

04:50.458 --> 04:51.925
Go interview
the other nanny,

04:51.959 --> 04:54.762
see if you can get
a description of the perp.

04:54.795 --> 04:57.731
Okay. Call me when you hear
anything about Lucy.

05:02.603 --> 05:04.838
Sarah's a baby-sitter,
not a certified nanny.

05:04.872 --> 05:05.939
It's sad, but this happens

05:05.973 --> 05:08.776
when children are left
with unqualified caregivers.

05:08.809 --> 05:10.644
Let's talk about
what happened today.

05:10.678 --> 05:11.912
My point exactly, Detective.

05:11.945 --> 05:14.548
I was taught to observe
my child's surroundings.

05:14.582 --> 05:16.950
That's why I noticed
that man and Sarah didn't.

05:16.984 --> 05:19.687
Can you tell
me about him?

05:19.720 --> 05:22.523
White guy, mid 40s,
short, dark hair.

05:22.556 --> 05:23.957
Very stocky.

05:23.991 --> 05:25.559
He's been lurking around

05:25.593 --> 05:27.528
the playground
the last few days.

05:27.561 --> 05:29.830
He seem especially
interested in Lucy?

05:29.863 --> 05:30.998
I really couldn't say.

05:31.031 --> 05:32.032
At first I thought

05:32.065 --> 05:33.601
he was just one of the dads,

05:33.634 --> 05:35.403
trying to get
some good candid shots.

05:35.436 --> 05:36.804
Photographs?

05:36.837 --> 05:38.606
Yes, he was
taking pictures.

05:38.639 --> 05:39.607
Where?

05:39.640 --> 05:41.875
The man was standing
right there on those rocks.

05:41.909 --> 05:44.111
Thank you.
We're going to have
an officer take you down

05:44.144 --> 05:45.713
to the precinct
for a sketch.

05:45.746 --> 05:47.047
I'm happy to help.

05:47.080 --> 05:48.682
Detective, Ian Felson,
from the Trib.

05:48.716 --> 05:50.618
You got anything for me?
Too soon to say.

05:50.651 --> 05:52.886
But you're working it
as a pedophile kidnap, right?

05:52.920 --> 05:54.488
No comment.
Oh, come on, Detective,

05:54.522 --> 05:56.657
deep background is all I need
to really get into this...

05:56.690 --> 05:57.858
No comment.

05:57.891 --> 05:58.992
Sorry, Elliot.

05:59.026 --> 06:00.494
I told the guy to get lost.

06:00.528 --> 06:01.962
Walk this way.

06:01.995 --> 06:04.498
It's going to find its way
to the headlines tomorrow.

06:04.532 --> 06:06.600
Probably dub the guy
the "Park Pervert."

06:06.634 --> 06:08.502
Well, if he's got
any information,

06:08.536 --> 06:10.037
I'd like to read about it.

06:10.070 --> 06:12.440
Area where you found
the girl, it's clean.

06:12.473 --> 06:15.175
Bagged all the trash nearby,
but nothing pertinent.

06:15.208 --> 06:18.011
We got a witness placing
a guy up on these rocks

06:18.045 --> 06:19.613
taking pictures of the kids.

06:19.647 --> 06:21.915
Use a telephoto lens,
you get great shots,

06:21.949 --> 06:23.917
no one would know
you're there.

06:23.951 --> 06:25.753
We haven't searched
up here yet.

06:25.786 --> 06:28.021
Didn't have any
indication the rocks

06:28.055 --> 06:30.958
were part of
the crime scene.

06:30.991 --> 06:34.495
The ground's too uneven
for footwear impressions.

06:34.528 --> 06:36.797
But if the guy smokes,
or chews gum,

06:36.830 --> 06:39.933
we could get his DNA
if he left anything behind.

06:41.769 --> 06:43.604
Will that do?

06:43.637 --> 06:44.505
Using film is unusual.

06:44.538 --> 06:46.440
What do you mean?
Pedophiles love photos.

06:46.474 --> 06:48.642
No, I'm not talking about
the pictures themselves.

06:48.676 --> 06:50.110
I'm talking about
how they were taken.

06:50.143 --> 06:51.779
Most pedophiles
have gone digital

06:51.812 --> 06:54.214
to avoid getting caught when
they get their film developed.

06:54.247 --> 06:55.549
Your guy is a risk taker.

06:55.583 --> 06:56.650
I think he proved that

06:56.684 --> 06:58.452
by attacking the kid
in broad daylight.

06:58.486 --> 07:00.554
If he had been waiting
for the perfect child,

07:00.588 --> 07:02.055
then he wouldn't
consider the danger,

07:02.089 --> 07:03.056
he'd be compelled to act.

07:03.090 --> 07:05.526
But the nanny realized
that Lucy was missing

07:05.559 --> 07:06.927
before he could do his thing.

07:06.960 --> 07:08.829
Her panics, knocks
the girl out and runs.

07:08.862 --> 07:11.499
Leaving his prints behind
on the film carton.

07:11.532 --> 07:13.967
Dennis Papillion.
One arrest, Burg Three.

07:14.001 --> 07:15.536
Probation officer says

07:15.569 --> 07:17.771
he works at a drugstore
on Broadway.

07:17.805 --> 07:22.075
43, stocky, short hair, sounds
like Veronica's description.

07:22.109 --> 07:23.143
Let's go.

07:27.214 --> 07:28.716
You know this guy?

07:28.749 --> 07:31.184
Yeah. He's right over there,
in photo finishing.

07:31.218 --> 07:32.886
Thank you.

07:32.920 --> 07:35.656
You don't need a digital camera
if you can print your own porn.

07:35.689 --> 07:38.592
CRAGEN:
Dennis Papillion?

07:38.626 --> 07:40.127
Yeah. Why you want to know?

07:40.160 --> 07:42.229
The badges mean
we ask the questions.

07:42.262 --> 07:44.131
Where were you
this morning?

07:44.164 --> 07:46.900
You got the wrong guy.
I've been here since
we opened at 7:00.

07:46.934 --> 07:49.570
Check the security tapes.
Now, can I ask what
this is about?

07:49.603 --> 07:51.639
STABLER:
Your prints were found
at a crime scene

07:51.672 --> 07:52.906
on a box of film.

07:52.940 --> 07:54.742
Now, there's
a surprise.

07:54.775 --> 07:56.209
You know how much I sell?

07:56.243 --> 07:59.046
The customer asks for it,
I hand it over.

07:59.079 --> 07:59.913
You process it
for them, too?

07:59.947 --> 08:01.682
Sure, I do a couple
hundred rolls a day.

08:01.715 --> 08:02.850
Do you ever
look at the photos?

08:02.883 --> 08:05.218
Just to make sure
they come out okay.

08:05.252 --> 08:08.121
The guy we're looking for would
have taken a lot of shots

08:08.155 --> 08:10.023
of a playground
in Riverside Park.

08:10.057 --> 08:12.159
Oh, yeah, I ran those off
this morning. Boring.

08:12.192 --> 08:13.927
STABLER:
He pick them up yet?

08:13.961 --> 08:15.162
About an hour ago.

08:15.195 --> 08:18.131
But he dropped off
another couple of rolls.

08:18.165 --> 08:20.834
He said he'd be back
later to get them.

08:22.836 --> 08:25.606
"Ronny Ickles."
Address on 29th Street.

08:25.639 --> 08:28.876
We'll make a special delivery.

08:28.909 --> 08:30.611
Hold on, I'm no damn baby raper.

08:30.644 --> 08:32.179
Right, hanging
around a playground,

08:32.212 --> 08:33.947
taking pictures
of little kids

08:33.981 --> 08:35.849
is a normal pastime
for a grown man.

08:35.883 --> 08:37.117
I was working. I'm a PI.

08:37.150 --> 08:38.151
Where's your ticket?

08:38.185 --> 08:40.020
I don't have my license yet.

08:40.053 --> 08:42.322
If it was a legit job,
why did you leave
the playground

08:42.355 --> 08:43.824
when the cops showed up?

08:43.857 --> 08:45.292
I didn't want to get involved.

08:45.325 --> 08:47.060
My client wouldn't like that.

08:47.094 --> 08:48.295
You're working
an illegal shop.

08:48.328 --> 08:50.197
You cooperate or we collar you.

08:50.230 --> 08:51.131
All right, all right.

08:51.164 --> 08:54.602
My client is this rich guy,
David Jeffries.

08:54.635 --> 08:56.770
He hire you to shoot
kiddie porn on commission?

08:56.804 --> 08:58.171
I don't need work that bad.

08:58.205 --> 08:59.206
Oh, yeah?

09:00.641 --> 09:03.210
That's a six-month supply
for a pedophile.

09:03.243 --> 09:04.277
He wasn't into kids.

09:04.311 --> 09:06.880
He wanted me to spy
on his nanny.

09:06.914 --> 09:09.850
Jeffries hired me
to watch how his son

09:09.883 --> 09:12.219
got treated
when he wasn't around.

09:12.252 --> 09:15.188
Worst thing I saw was
the nanny was smoking.

09:16.223 --> 09:17.024
Hey.

09:17.057 --> 09:18.726
Picked up the rest
of your PI's photos

09:18.759 --> 09:19.793
on my way back from court.

09:19.827 --> 09:20.961
Thanks.
How's Lucy doing?

09:20.994 --> 09:22.763
Last I heard, she's
still in surgery.

09:22.796 --> 09:24.765
Client confirms Ickles story.

09:24.798 --> 09:27.334
So do these pictures
once you sort them out.

09:27.367 --> 09:29.269
You got a lot of shots
of the kids,

09:29.302 --> 09:30.771
but even more of the nannies.

09:30.804 --> 09:34.942
Now, I got about ten photos
of Lucy up here.

09:34.975 --> 09:36.944
All of them time-coded.

09:36.977 --> 09:39.613
These are the last three
before she disappeared.

09:39.647 --> 09:41.248
So, we got Lucy playing with

09:41.281 --> 09:42.783
a little blonde girl.

09:42.816 --> 09:44.284
The next is a minute later

09:44.317 --> 09:45.819
and Lucy is wandering away.

09:45.853 --> 09:48.321
She's headed
right to the spot
where we found her.

09:48.355 --> 09:49.356
That's the last one.

09:49.389 --> 09:50.891
Lucy is almost
out of sight.

09:50.924 --> 09:53.326
And then Sarah
is panicking,
and these shots

09:53.360 --> 09:55.996
are only about a minute
after the last one with Lucy.

09:56.029 --> 09:58.298
Not a lot of time for an attack.
( phone ringing )

09:58.331 --> 10:00.333
There's something
just not right here.

10:00.367 --> 10:02.302
There's no one
anywhere near her.

10:02.335 --> 10:03.303
Benson.

10:03.336 --> 10:04.738
Maybe there is no crime.

10:04.772 --> 10:06.273
This could be an accident.

10:06.306 --> 10:08.308
Lucy tripped, conked
her head on the way down.

10:08.341 --> 10:10.110
Yeah, kids her age
fall down all the time,

10:10.143 --> 10:12.312
but they don't knock themselves
out and need surgery.

10:12.345 --> 10:13.847
BENSON:
Elliot, that was
the hospital.

10:13.881 --> 10:16.383
Lucy's doctor wants to see you.

10:22.790 --> 10:25.292
Lucy's out of surgery.
She's stable but still
unconscious.

10:25.325 --> 10:27.194
Any chance
she could have fallen?

10:27.227 --> 10:30.664
No. She's has bilateral
subdural hematomas,
with retinal shearing...

10:30.698 --> 10:31.498
Shaken baby syndrome.

10:31.531 --> 10:33.300
Yeah. She was shaken
with enough force

10:33.333 --> 10:34.167
to cause severe trauma.

10:34.201 --> 10:35.135
What are her chances?

10:35.168 --> 10:37.270
Oh, it's hard to say,
but if she does recover,

10:37.304 --> 10:39.306
she'll probably have
permanent brain damage.

10:39.339 --> 10:41.041
Are you sure about
this diagnosis?

10:41.074 --> 10:42.710
There's no way
this was an accident?

10:42.743 --> 10:44.211
Oh, I'm sure.

10:59.126 --> 11:00.260
Shaken baby syndrome refers
to a constellation of injuries,

11:02.262 --> 11:04.431
most commonly,
bilateral subdural hematomas.

11:04.464 --> 11:05.799
BISHOP:
Which means...?

11:05.833 --> 11:07.467
STABLER:
Massive bruises
to the brain.

11:07.500 --> 11:11.705
Shaking causes the baby's head
to snap back and forth.

11:14.307 --> 11:17.477
Let's say this egg is the baby's
brain and the jar is its skull.

11:17.510 --> 11:20.247
When the two collide
at high speed from shaking...

11:20.280 --> 11:21.915
the injury is devastating.

11:21.949 --> 11:23.283
BISHOP:
So you'll testify

11:23.316 --> 11:25.018
that shaken baby syndrome

11:25.052 --> 11:27.855
can be the only cause
of Lucy's brain injuries?

11:27.888 --> 11:29.122
Yes.

11:29.156 --> 11:30.323
I read her
doctor's reports.

11:30.357 --> 11:33.160
Her eyes show
distinctive retinal shearing

11:33.193 --> 11:34.795
and small hemorrhages.

11:34.828 --> 11:36.764
Plus, she has compression
fractures of the ribs

11:36.797 --> 11:38.231
from where the perp grabbed her.

11:38.265 --> 11:40.834
That's pathonomonic
for shaken baby.

11:40.868 --> 11:43.036
How can this happen
on a playground without
anyone noticing?

11:43.070 --> 11:44.104
Based on the amount

11:44.137 --> 11:45.873
of blood in the skull cavity,

11:45.906 --> 11:48.441
I'd say the attack happened
between 12 and 48 hours

11:48.475 --> 11:50.911
before you found her.
She would have been sleepy,

11:50.944 --> 11:53.113
lethargic, maybe even vomiting,
but ambulatory.

11:53.146 --> 11:55.916
So the perp could be anyone
who had contact with Lucy

11:55.949 --> 11:57.384
in the last three days.

11:59.853 --> 12:01.789
MRS. PRICHARD:
I don't understand.

12:01.822 --> 12:03.190
When I left for work yesterday,

12:03.223 --> 12:04.858
she was fine.

12:04.892 --> 12:06.393
She was walking
and talking.

12:06.426 --> 12:07.895
Did the doctors explain

12:07.928 --> 12:09.863
that her brain could have
bled out so slowly

12:09.897 --> 12:11.932
that she would have seemed
fine for a few days?

12:11.965 --> 12:13.901
Yes.

12:13.934 --> 12:16.003
It's just hard to believe
that she was hurt

12:16.036 --> 12:17.470
and that I didn't know it.

12:18.839 --> 12:21.842
Who does Lucy spend most
of her time with?

12:21.875 --> 12:23.010
Adults.

12:23.043 --> 12:27.047
Just me and Sarah.

12:27.080 --> 12:29.049
Mm. You have
a boyfriend?

12:29.082 --> 12:30.550
( mirthless chuckle )

12:30.583 --> 12:33.486
I... I haven't dated

12:33.520 --> 12:37.958
since my husband died.

12:37.991 --> 12:40.994
How did Lucy seem
Monday night?

12:41.028 --> 12:42.129
I worked late.

12:42.162 --> 12:45.298
By the time I got home,
she was asleep.

12:45.332 --> 12:47.467
I try to get off work early,

12:47.500 --> 12:49.369
but I need all the overtime
I can get.

12:49.402 --> 12:53.140
So Lucy was alone with Sarah
all day Monday and Tuesday,

12:53.173 --> 12:55.943
right up until the time
they went to the playground?

12:55.976 --> 12:57.044
Yes.

12:59.112 --> 13:01.114
You happy with Sarah?

13:02.115 --> 13:03.550
She's all right.

13:03.583 --> 13:05.919
I wanted somebody
with more experience,

13:05.953 --> 13:07.154
but I can't afford it.

13:07.187 --> 13:08.455
She ever rough with Lucy?

13:08.488 --> 13:11.224
I caught her yelling
at Lucy once

13:11.258 --> 13:14.061
but if she ever would have
hit her, I would have fired her.

13:14.094 --> 13:17.898
You ever notice any marks
or bruises on her?

13:17.931 --> 13:21.168
Yes. Sometimes.
I ask Sarah about it,

13:21.201 --> 13:25.105
and she'd say that Lucy
fell down, or that she...

13:25.138 --> 13:28.541
got hit by a kid
in the playground.

13:28.575 --> 13:30.911
You think Sarah hurt Lucy?

13:32.112 --> 13:34.114
Do you?

13:36.516 --> 13:38.852
I'm only supposed to work
from 8:00 to 6:00,

13:38.886 --> 13:40.954
but Evelyn never gets home
until after 9:00.

13:40.988 --> 13:42.155
Long hours.

13:42.189 --> 13:45.558
Lot of responsibility
for a young woman.

13:45.592 --> 13:47.194
Lucy an easy kid?

13:47.227 --> 13:48.495
I wish.

13:48.528 --> 13:51.064
She was a colicky baby
and now she's a screamer.

13:51.098 --> 13:53.133
Throws huge tantrums
every time her mother goes out.

13:53.166 --> 13:55.402
You couldn't pay me enough
to do what you do.

13:55.435 --> 13:58.071
I hear a kid scream,
it makes me insane.

13:58.105 --> 13:59.406
I don't know
how you stand it.

13:59.439 --> 14:00.974
It's so hard.

14:05.012 --> 14:06.046
Sometimes I get...

14:06.079 --> 14:08.015
Frustrated?

14:08.048 --> 14:09.482
She's just a little girl,

14:09.516 --> 14:11.551
but she can make me so mad.

14:11.584 --> 14:13.053
I understand.

14:13.086 --> 14:15.422
A couple of months ago,
Lucy threw a toy at me,

14:15.455 --> 14:16.990
and I spanked her,

14:17.024 --> 14:18.591
even though Evelyn
told me not to.

14:18.625 --> 14:20.627
Well, when we get mad,
we lose control.

14:22.495 --> 14:25.032
We all have our breaking point.

14:26.266 --> 14:27.901
Are you saying
I hurt Lucy?

14:27.935 --> 14:29.536
Sarah, you were
the only one with her

14:29.569 --> 14:31.138
all day Monday
and Tuesday.

14:31.171 --> 14:32.940
I didn't hurt her,
I swear.

14:32.973 --> 14:35.108
So how did she wind up
on life support?

14:35.142 --> 14:37.244
That day she fell down a lot.

14:37.277 --> 14:38.611
But the injuries Lucy has

14:38.645 --> 14:40.647
couldn't have been
caused by a fall.

14:42.182 --> 14:43.984
Then I don't know.

14:46.686 --> 14:48.455
You willing to take
a polygraph?

14:51.558 --> 14:52.692
I'm afraid.

14:52.725 --> 14:54.427
Sarah,
if there's something

14:54.461 --> 14:56.463
you're not telling me,
now is the time.

14:57.497 --> 14:58.999
( crying )

15:01.401 --> 15:04.337
Evelyn pays me so little,

15:04.371 --> 15:06.106
and I work so hard.

15:06.139 --> 15:08.308
It makes me really mad.

15:10.043 --> 15:13.413
I know it was wrong...
but I did it.

15:15.415 --> 15:17.284
What did you do?

15:17.317 --> 15:19.719
I took money from her purse.

15:19.752 --> 15:22.689
Five, sometimes ten dollars.

15:23.690 --> 15:25.058
( sniffling )

15:29.296 --> 15:30.463
I don't think
Sarah did it.

15:30.497 --> 15:32.332
Based on what?
My gut.

15:32.365 --> 15:33.533
That's not admissible.

15:33.566 --> 15:35.735
Look, Huang says
Sarah fits the profile.

15:35.768 --> 15:38.138
Overwhelmed, cooped up
long hours with
a difficult child...

15:38.171 --> 15:40.273
She's torn up about ripping off
a couple hundred bucks.

15:40.307 --> 15:41.708
I don't think she's lying
about hurting Lucy.

15:41.741 --> 15:42.875
It could be
she's a clever sociopath.

15:42.909 --> 15:45.345
Admits to
a meaningless infraction,
gains your sympathy.

15:45.378 --> 15:46.479
So give her
a polygraph.

15:46.513 --> 15:47.947
It'll prove
she didn't do it.

15:47.981 --> 15:50.750
Hate to rain on your parade,
but it looks like you're
wrong about Sarah.

15:50.783 --> 15:53.186
What do you got?
A call from the Tribune.
They got the story,

15:53.220 --> 15:56.023
plus a source who saw
Sarah abusing Lucy.

15:56.056 --> 15:57.157
Who's your
eyewitness?

15:57.190 --> 15:58.291
They didn't say.

15:58.325 --> 16:00.327
Ian Felson wrote the piece.

16:01.461 --> 16:03.730
Your office said
I'd find you here.

16:03.763 --> 16:05.332
Make it quick.

16:05.365 --> 16:06.766
Perp walk starts any minute.

16:06.799 --> 16:09.136
I need your witness
in the Prichard case.

16:09.169 --> 16:10.470
I know it's confidential.

16:10.503 --> 16:12.705
You help me out, I'll
make it worth your while.

16:12.739 --> 16:14.741
( camera clicking )

16:16.809 --> 16:18.311
Exclusive on the arrest?

16:18.345 --> 16:19.212
Done.

16:19.246 --> 16:21.048
Let me make a call.

16:25.052 --> 16:26.786
It's Ian Felson, from the Trib.

16:26.819 --> 16:30.157
The police would like
to talk to you.

16:31.158 --> 16:32.292
Thanks.

16:34.361 --> 16:35.628
She says it's cool.

16:35.662 --> 16:36.729
Who's she?

16:36.763 --> 16:38.631
Veronica Nash.

16:38.665 --> 16:41.201
That's the other nanny.
I already talked to her.

16:41.234 --> 16:43.336
I guess you didn't ask
the right questions.

16:44.704 --> 16:46.539
How in the hell did you
forget to tell me

16:46.573 --> 16:50.143
that Sarah had abused her?

16:50.177 --> 16:51.611
You didn't ask.

16:51.644 --> 16:53.780
I thought that pervert
from the park hurt Lucy

16:53.813 --> 16:56.449
until that reporter started
asking me questions.

16:56.483 --> 16:59.619
What exactly
did you tell him?

17:01.221 --> 17:05.625
Lucy is a difficult child--
willful, defiant.

17:05.658 --> 17:08.395
Sarah has a hard time
controlling her.

17:08.428 --> 17:10.263
She gets frustrated

17:10.297 --> 17:11.131
and hits Lucy.

17:11.164 --> 17:13.466
You've seen her do that?
More than once.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.502
Can you remember
any specific incidents?

17:15.535 --> 17:17.170
Will I have to testify?

17:17.204 --> 17:19.639
Ma'am, you just told
millions of Tribune readers.

17:19.672 --> 17:21.808
I think you can
handle 12 jurors.

17:26.413 --> 17:27.380
A few weeks ago,

17:27.414 --> 17:30.150
Sarah and I took the children
to the museum.

17:30.183 --> 17:33.586
Lucy started running around
like a little maniac.

17:33.620 --> 17:35.722
Then she started
throwing things.

17:35.755 --> 17:41.494
One of the staff yelled at Sarah
for not controlling her.

17:41.528 --> 17:45.632
Then she smacked Lucy
across the face, hard.

17:48.768 --> 17:51.571
WOMAN:
Sure, I remember that kid.

17:51.604 --> 17:54.341
She's a very active
little girl.

17:54.374 --> 17:56.743
She was very excited
by the artwork.

17:56.776 --> 17:58.845
She ran around
touching everything.

17:58.878 --> 18:00.413
Is that a problem?

18:00.447 --> 18:04.251
No. Our exhibits are designed
to be interactive,

18:04.284 --> 18:05.852
and we encourage the children

18:05.885 --> 18:10.223
to express themselves.
It was the nanny
who got upset.

18:10.257 --> 18:11.791
She was rough
with the child.

18:11.824 --> 18:13.360
Hit her pretty hard.

18:13.393 --> 18:14.561
Did you report her?

18:14.594 --> 18:16.696
I went and found
the security guard,

18:16.729 --> 18:18.465
but when we got back,
they were gone.

18:19.466 --> 18:21.368
It's just a formality.

18:21.401 --> 18:22.802
Do you recognize
this woman?

18:22.835 --> 18:24.171
Sure. She was there
that day, too.

18:24.204 --> 18:26.173
What do you mean, "too"?

18:26.206 --> 18:28.241
Well, she didn't
hit the kid.

18:28.275 --> 18:30.177
It was this other woman.

18:30.210 --> 18:31.844
Lady...

18:31.878 --> 18:33.780
you are either stupid
or out of your mind.

18:33.813 --> 18:36.149
What did you think?
I wouldn't go to the museum

18:36.183 --> 18:37.184
and check on your story?

18:37.217 --> 18:38.518
What are you
talking about?

18:38.551 --> 18:40.220
You hit Lucy, not Sarah.

18:40.253 --> 18:42.589
Museum staff
picked you out.

18:42.622 --> 18:44.491
Lucy deserved a spanking.

18:44.524 --> 18:46.159
Well, sweetheart,
the way I hear it,

18:46.193 --> 18:47.394
you gave her a lot more
than that.

18:47.427 --> 18:49.162
She needs discipline.

18:49.196 --> 18:50.630
Her behavior is atrocious.

18:50.663 --> 18:53.566
So is yours, sweetheart!
You're sick, you know that?!

18:53.600 --> 18:55.502
What is it, you need
attention so badly,

18:55.535 --> 18:57.337
you run to a reporter
and lie to him

18:57.370 --> 18:59.239
just to see your name
in the paper?

18:59.272 --> 19:01.274
I have years of training,
Detective.

19:01.308 --> 19:04.511
And I've got a witness
who saw you hit that child.

19:06.513 --> 19:08.181
You shake her, too?

19:08.215 --> 19:09.416
I hadn't seen Lucy for days

19:09.449 --> 19:11.618
until Tuesday morning
at the playground.

19:11.651 --> 19:12.819
I was with my employers

19:12.852 --> 19:14.587
at their country home
all weekend.

19:14.621 --> 19:16.256
Call them.

19:16.289 --> 19:19.226
Veronica Nash's story
checks out.

19:19.259 --> 19:20.593
She didn't shake that baby.

19:20.627 --> 19:22.229
CRAGEN:
We can still
charge her

19:22.262 --> 19:23.896
for assaulting Lucy
at the museum.

19:23.930 --> 19:24.897
Good. Do it.

19:24.931 --> 19:27.300
The papers crucify her.
She'll lose her job.

19:27.334 --> 19:28.768
That's something.

19:29.769 --> 19:31.204
Are you mad at her

19:31.238 --> 19:32.171
or at yourself?

19:32.205 --> 19:33.940
Look, I've got a little girl
in the hospital

19:33.973 --> 19:35.007
who's not getting any better.

19:35.041 --> 19:37.577
I just wasted a whole day
on that idiot's lies.

19:37.610 --> 19:39.479
I'm no closer
to making a collar here.

19:39.512 --> 19:41.948
I got one you can rule out.
Polygraph results.

19:41.981 --> 19:44.717
Sarah passed
with flying colors.

19:44.751 --> 19:47.754
Well, any consolation,
your gut instincts were right.

19:47.787 --> 19:50.223
I should have trusted them
instead of that crap
in the Tribune.

19:50.257 --> 19:52.792
The only thing
that paper is good for
is lining my bird cage.

19:52.825 --> 19:54.794
CRAGEN:
Where you going?

19:54.827 --> 19:56.563
Back to the hospital.

20:01.000 --> 20:04.337
She almost looks like
she's sleeping.

20:04.371 --> 20:06.239
Any news, Detective?

20:06.273 --> 20:08.441
Sarah Rendell's
been cleared.

20:08.475 --> 20:10.477
Then who hurt Lucy?

20:14.046 --> 20:15.382
You tell me.

20:19.386 --> 20:21.288
You're crazy.

20:21.321 --> 20:22.088
I love my daughter.

20:22.121 --> 20:23.723
Only you and Sarah
were with her

20:23.756 --> 20:25.992
the last two days.

20:26.025 --> 20:28.295
Your own words.

20:28.328 --> 20:32.265
I-I should have told you before.

20:34.066 --> 20:35.868
There was someone else.

20:39.572 --> 20:40.940
Who?

20:40.973 --> 20:43.276
I didn't think
he could have done it.

20:43.310 --> 20:45.312
I was only gone
for a little while.

20:45.345 --> 20:47.414
That's your daughter
lying in the crib.

20:47.447 --> 20:48.915
A machine's breathing for her.

20:48.948 --> 20:52.652
You really want to protect
the person who put her there?

20:58.425 --> 21:02.595
It's a man I've been seeing.

21:02.629 --> 21:04.731
Drew Farmer.

21:04.764 --> 21:07.534
He's married.

21:07.567 --> 21:10.403
I left him alone with Lucy.

21:18.878 --> 21:20.713
How come we're hearing just now

21:20.747 --> 21:22.715
about Evelyn Prichard's
mystery man?

21:22.749 --> 21:24.784
Because this Drew Farmer
is her boss.

21:24.817 --> 21:27.787
They've been having an affair
for the past couple months.

21:27.820 --> 21:28.921
The overtime Evelyn works.

21:28.955 --> 21:31.591
You got it--
Sunday night,
Drew's wife was out of town.

21:31.624 --> 21:34.093
Evelyn gave her
nanny the night off,
invited him over for dinner.

21:34.126 --> 21:35.161
Any idea how
Drew feels

21:35.194 --> 21:38.064
about kids?
According to Evelyn,
doesn't have any,

21:38.097 --> 21:39.198
doesn't want any.

21:39.231 --> 21:41.501
CRAGAN:
How long was he
alone with Lucy?
20 minutes.

21:41.534 --> 21:44.003
Mom's not gone that long--
why would he shake the kid?

21:44.036 --> 21:46.005
HUANG:
Kids get shaken
when they're crying.

21:46.038 --> 21:47.807
Research shows
that a child's screams

21:47.840 --> 21:49.876
can provoke extreme stress
in some people.

21:49.909 --> 21:51.611
Maybe Drew was trying
to shut Lucy up.

21:51.644 --> 21:54.947
Bring him in.

21:54.981 --> 21:56.816
Evelyn's an employee,
nothing more.

21:56.849 --> 21:58.485
Well, no one
on the support staff

21:58.518 --> 22:00.520
of the ad agency
works overtime but Evelyn,

22:00.553 --> 22:02.922
and she only does it
when your wife's out of town.

22:02.955 --> 22:05.024
Oh, this is absurd-- I'd
like to call my lawyer now.

22:05.057 --> 22:07.994
You got it. You just put
yourself in the jackpot, pal.

22:08.027 --> 22:10.597
You're crazy!
I never touched
the girl.

22:13.866 --> 22:16.503
So you admit
you were there?

22:16.536 --> 22:17.970
Look, my wife finds out,

22:18.004 --> 22:20.039
she will cut my balls off
in divorce court.

22:20.072 --> 22:21.541
If you keep
jerking me around,

22:21.574 --> 22:23.443
criminal court's going
to do a lot worse to you.

22:23.476 --> 22:26.145
I don't know
what happened to Lucy.
Yeah, you do.

22:26.178 --> 22:27.980
Look, it's turning
into a beautiful night,

22:28.014 --> 22:30.016
just you and Evelyn,
and then all of a sudden,

22:30.049 --> 22:31.518
she's got to go
to the store.

22:31.551 --> 22:33.119
And the kid
starts screaming.

22:33.152 --> 22:35.522
Well, you know,
you got to shut her up,

22:35.555 --> 22:37.089
because you know,
Mommy comes home

22:37.123 --> 22:38.791
and that kid
is still crying,

22:38.825 --> 22:41.528
Evelyn will be taking care
of her needs instead of yours,

22:41.561 --> 22:43.830
so you pick her up,
try to quiet her down,

22:43.863 --> 22:47.099
but she keeps crying,
and she's crying,
and she's crying...

22:47.133 --> 22:49.502
I just wanted her
to go back to sleep.

22:49.536 --> 22:51.671
Of course you did,
but she wouldn't, would she?

22:51.704 --> 22:54.607
And you don't know what
to do, you don't have kids,
so you shake her, huh?

22:54.641 --> 22:56.643
You shook her, and then
you just laid her down,

22:56.676 --> 22:58.478
'cause she's quiet now.
No, you're wrong.

22:58.511 --> 23:00.547
You shook that baby.
You shook that
baby, Drew,

23:00.580 --> 23:02.615
and then you got your
rocks off with her mother

23:02.649 --> 23:04.451
while her baby lay
dying a few feet away.

23:04.484 --> 23:06.753
No, I didn't shake her!
I picked her up, that's all.

23:06.786 --> 23:07.887
She must have been sick.

23:07.920 --> 23:10.089
What do you mean,
she was sick?

23:10.122 --> 23:13.993
She puked all over my jacket,
and I put her right back down.

23:14.026 --> 23:16.095
Evelyn never said
Lucy threw up.

23:16.128 --> 23:17.630
I didn't tell her.

23:17.664 --> 23:20.132
I didn't...

23:21.501 --> 23:24.471
I didn't want
to spoil the mood.

23:24.504 --> 23:29.976
Oh, geez.

23:30.009 --> 23:32.044
CRAGAN:
It's not enough for an arrest.

23:32.078 --> 23:34.013
We've got to cut him loose.
I know, I know,

23:34.046 --> 23:35.615
but I'm telling you,
it pisses me off.

23:35.648 --> 23:37.016
Somebody almost killed
that little girl.

23:37.049 --> 23:38.951
She can't speak,
but all the adults in her life

23:38.985 --> 23:41.053
are lying their asses off?

23:41.087 --> 23:42.955
Then we go back
to the medical evidence.

23:42.989 --> 23:48.728
We'll put it all together,
and let it tell the real story.

23:48.761 --> 23:49.729
This is the timeline

23:49.762 --> 23:51.798
of the last three days.

23:51.831 --> 23:54.667
Tuesday, Lucy collapsed,
but according to Sarah,

23:54.701 --> 23:56.669
she was lethargic and clumsy
on Monday.

23:56.703 --> 23:59.005
Ataxia and decreased
motor skills are common

23:59.038 --> 24:00.773
after a shaking incident.

24:00.807 --> 24:02.675
So you're saying the
attack happened Sunday.

24:02.709 --> 24:04.744
Yes. Lucy vomiting
Sunday night

24:04.777 --> 24:06.746
is a classic sign
of head trauma.

24:06.779 --> 24:09.816
So Evelyn shook Lucy earlier,
and that's why she
threw up on Drew.

24:09.849 --> 24:11.317
Well, who knows
what came first?

24:11.350 --> 24:14.554
Getting puked on could've
pissed Drew off enough
that he shook the kid.

24:14.587 --> 24:15.822
There's no
medical reason

24:15.855 --> 24:17.990
for Lucy's sudden emesis
without the shaking.

24:18.024 --> 24:19.792
I could be wrong,
but the symptoms

24:19.826 --> 24:21.794
and the time frame
point to Evelyn.

24:21.828 --> 24:25.031
Any way to connect Evelyn
to Lucy's wounds?

24:25.064 --> 24:27.834
Lucy has rib fractures
from where the perp grabbed her.

24:27.867 --> 24:29.636
A different hand size
would cause

24:29.669 --> 24:30.970
a different fracture pattern.

24:31.003 --> 24:34.273
If I shook you, I would
leave an impression here,

24:34.306 --> 24:37.143
but the captain's
hands are bigger...

24:37.176 --> 24:40.747
and would cause a
different fracture
pattern.

24:40.780 --> 24:43.015
Find the hand,
find the perp.

24:44.784 --> 24:46.553
Evelyn?

24:46.586 --> 24:48.187
Detective.
Have you heard something?

24:48.220 --> 24:49.388
No.

24:49.421 --> 24:52.592
This is Dr. Warner.
She'd like to conduct
an examination.

24:52.625 --> 24:54.126
Hold out your hand like this,
please.

24:54.160 --> 24:55.862
I don't understand.
Just...

24:55.895 --> 24:57.530
help us out.

25:02.602 --> 25:04.203
It's a match.

25:04.236 --> 25:05.905
Drew Farmer's hands
are much bigger.

25:05.938 --> 25:08.541
You shook Lucy.

25:08.575 --> 25:10.843
No. I'm her mother.
I love her.

25:10.877 --> 25:12.812
I love my little girl.
I would never hurt her.

25:12.845 --> 25:15.247
I'm putting you under
arrest for assault
and attempted murder.

25:15.281 --> 25:17.617
This is a mistake.
You have the right
to remain silent.

25:17.650 --> 25:19.919
I am a good mother.
If you give up that right,
anything you say

25:19.952 --> 25:21.854
can and will be
used against you
in a court of law.

25:21.888 --> 25:24.624
You get a confession?
She lawyered up.

25:24.657 --> 25:26.893
I look forward to trying her.

25:26.926 --> 25:28.695
She's going to be sympathetic.

25:28.728 --> 25:30.863
I can't believe a jury'll
feel sorry for a parent

25:30.897 --> 25:32.565
who scrambled
her kid's brain.

25:32.599 --> 25:34.601
And I'm telling you, every
parent has been there.

25:34.634 --> 25:36.268
A baby's crying can
make you lose your mind.

25:36.302 --> 25:38.004
You'll pick them up,
you rock them.

25:38.037 --> 25:40.139
I mean, hell, you'll
beg them, and...

25:40.172 --> 25:42.241
sometimes nothing works.

25:42.274 --> 25:45.912
It sounds like
you're speaking from
personal experience.

25:45.945 --> 25:48.180
Ah, the unholy cabal.

25:48.214 --> 25:50.850
Planning on how to railroad
the next innocent person?

25:50.883 --> 25:54.353
I'm planning on locking
her up for life.

25:54.386 --> 25:56.022
What a pity.

25:56.055 --> 25:58.858
A few months in Special Victims,
and you're already a zealot.

25:58.891 --> 26:01.661
An injured child comes in,
and you scream abuse.

26:01.694 --> 26:03.996
Lucy wasn't spanked.
She's in a coma,
close to death,

26:04.030 --> 26:06.065
because her mother shook
the life out of her.

26:06.098 --> 26:08.835
What happened is
a devastating tragedy, but...

26:08.868 --> 26:10.937
it's not Evelyn's fault.
Temporary insanity

26:10.970 --> 26:13.906
brought on by the stress
of raising a child
with permanent live-in help?

26:13.940 --> 26:17.143
No excuses.
I meant what I said.

26:17.176 --> 26:19.812
She's innocent,
and I'll prove it.

26:26.653 --> 26:29.656
So, in your expert opinion

26:29.689 --> 26:31.791
Dr. Warner,
who is responsible

26:31.824 --> 26:34.226
for the injuries
to Lucy Prichard?

26:34.260 --> 26:36.362
The defendant,
Evelyn Prichard.

26:36.395 --> 26:37.630
Thank you.

26:37.664 --> 26:39.331
Nothing further.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.636
Are you saying
that the only possible cause

26:43.670 --> 26:45.972
of Lucy's injuries
is shaken baby syndrome?

26:46.005 --> 26:47.373
Yes.

26:47.406 --> 26:50.242
The subdural hematomas
and retinal hemorrhages

26:50.276 --> 26:51.711
are classic signs.

26:51.744 --> 26:52.812
Are you familiar with

26:52.845 --> 26:55.414
hemophagocytic
lymphohistiocytosis,

26:55.447 --> 26:56.983
or HLH?

26:57.016 --> 26:58.851
It's a rare blood
disorder that disrupts

26:58.885 --> 27:00.386
liver and bone marrow function.

27:00.419 --> 27:01.453
Isn't it true

27:01.487 --> 27:06.358
that HLH also causes
bleeding of the brain and eyes?

27:06.392 --> 27:07.827
Yes.

27:07.860 --> 27:09.862
Was Lucy's blood tested for HLH?

27:09.896 --> 27:11.931
There's no blood test,

27:11.964 --> 27:15.001
but HLH could not have caused
her rib fractures.

27:15.034 --> 27:19.005
CPR was performed on Lucy
in Riverside Park.

27:19.038 --> 27:24.410
CPR requires chest compressions,
correct?

27:24.443 --> 27:26.378
Yes.

27:26.412 --> 27:27.980
So isn't it possible

27:28.014 --> 27:32.184
that the lifesaving treatment
caused the fractures?

27:32.218 --> 27:33.786
No.

27:33.820 --> 27:36.255
CPR is administered with
the patient lying on her back.

27:36.288 --> 27:37.957
Chest compressions
could have caused

27:37.990 --> 27:39.926
the frontal rib fractures
but certainly not

27:39.959 --> 27:41.694
the posterior ones.
But couldn't those

27:41.728 --> 27:43.896
have been caused
by Detective Stabler,

27:43.930 --> 27:46.432
who testified that he, quote,
"grabbed Lucy

27:46.465 --> 27:48.300
and ran"?

27:48.334 --> 27:50.369
Why didn't you rule out

27:50.402 --> 27:51.938
a diagnosis of HLH?

27:51.971 --> 27:53.305
Because the only way

27:53.339 --> 27:55.107
to distinguish between HLH

27:55.141 --> 27:57.343
and shaken baby syndrome
is an autopsy.

27:57.376 --> 27:59.846
So for all you know right now,

27:59.879 --> 28:03.215
Lucy's injuries
could have been caused

28:03.249 --> 28:06.285
by a natural disease
and not a criminal act.

28:09.188 --> 28:12.158
Yes.

28:12.191 --> 28:13.425
The day my daughter was born,

28:13.459 --> 28:16.228
it was the happiest day
of my life.

28:16.262 --> 28:17.897
And then your
husband died.

28:17.930 --> 28:21.968
It must be very
difficult raising
a child without him.

28:22.001 --> 28:23.302
Yes, it is.

28:23.335 --> 28:25.104
I wanted to be
a stay-at-home mom,

28:25.137 --> 28:27.406
but now I have to be
the breadwinner.

28:27.439 --> 28:29.942
For the child's sake?

28:29.976 --> 28:31.010
Evelyn...

28:31.043 --> 28:32.879
did you ever spank Lucy?

28:32.912 --> 28:34.313
No.

28:34.346 --> 28:36.783
I don't believe
in corporal punishment.

28:36.816 --> 28:38.785
Have you ever shaken Lucy?

28:38.818 --> 28:39.986
( laughs ):
No.

28:40.019 --> 28:43.522
I know what shaking
can do to a baby.

28:43.555 --> 28:46.926
I would...
never hurt my daughter.

28:46.959 --> 28:48.360
Thank you.

28:48.394 --> 28:50.830
Your witness.

28:53.866 --> 28:56.936
You say you love your daughter,
Mrs. Prichard.

28:56.969 --> 28:58.971
How much time
during the last few months

28:59.005 --> 29:00.506
did you actually spend with her?

29:00.539 --> 29:01.841
Not as much

29:01.874 --> 29:03.409
as I wanted.

29:03.442 --> 29:06.312
My husband's death
left a lot of bills.

29:06.345 --> 29:10.182
I had to work very long hours
just to make ends meet.

29:10.216 --> 29:12.919
So you relied on Sarah
to be her primary caregiver.

29:12.952 --> 29:15.254
I take care of my daughter.

29:15.287 --> 29:16.789
But you would leave

29:16.823 --> 29:18.457
before she got up in the morning

29:18.490 --> 29:20.827
and come home
after Lucy went to bed.

29:22.328 --> 29:23.295
Yes.

29:23.329 --> 29:26.966
So who hugs Lucy
when she gets up in the morning?

29:26.999 --> 29:29.802
Sarah does.

29:29.836 --> 29:32.071
And who puts Lucy to bed?

29:32.104 --> 29:34.173
Sarah.

29:34.206 --> 29:37.043
And who takes her to the park,
and to the zoo?

29:37.076 --> 29:39.011
And who comforts her
when she cries,

29:39.045 --> 29:41.347
and who puts a Band-Aid on
when she skins her knee?

29:41.380 --> 29:42.915
I wanted to be there.

29:42.949 --> 29:44.817
Lucy was crying
that night,

29:44.851 --> 29:47.353
and you didn't know
how to comfort her.

29:47.386 --> 29:49.388
She was ruining
your romantic date.

29:49.421 --> 29:51.090
That's why you shook her.

29:51.123 --> 29:52.424
No!

29:52.458 --> 29:56.195
I... I could never hurt Lucy.

29:56.228 --> 29:58.464
Why don't you believe me?

30:00.632 --> 30:02.801
Nothing further.

30:08.207 --> 30:10.342
Judge is going to turn it
to the jury after lunch.

30:10.376 --> 30:12.211
Then, hopefully,
it'll be a quick verdict.

30:12.244 --> 30:13.980
I think they're with us.
I'm telling you,

30:14.013 --> 30:15.347
you can't tell
with these cases.

30:15.381 --> 30:17.216
You preparing me
for an acquittal?

30:17.249 --> 30:19.018
I've worked enough
battered kid cases

30:19.051 --> 30:21.187
to know-- giving birth
doesn't make you a mother,

30:21.220 --> 30:22.855
( cell phone ringing )
but juries...

30:22.889 --> 30:24.423
they believe
what they need to believe.

30:24.456 --> 30:27.193
Stabler.

30:27.226 --> 30:28.427
When?

30:28.460 --> 30:30.229
Okay, I'm here

30:30.262 --> 30:31.597
with Novak--
I'll tell her.

30:31.630 --> 30:33.299
Tell me what?

30:33.332 --> 30:35.034
Lucy just had a stroke.

30:35.067 --> 30:38.104
They don't think she'll live.

30:39.505 --> 30:41.273
A massive brain hemorrhage

30:41.307 --> 30:42.909
destroyed Lucy's
cerebral cortex.

30:42.942 --> 30:45.177
She'd be dead already if
she wasn't on life support.

30:45.211 --> 30:47.046
How long can the machines
keep her alive?

30:47.079 --> 30:49.348
We don't know--
could be days,
or months.

30:49.381 --> 30:50.682
Explain her condition to me.

30:50.716 --> 30:55.021
Uh, Lucy is in what's
called a persistent
vegetative state.

30:55.054 --> 30:56.655
She has minimal
brain stem function

30:56.688 --> 30:59.358
that keeps her heart beating,
her blood circulating,

30:59.391 --> 31:03.562
but she can't move,
speak, hear or see.

31:03.595 --> 31:04.897
She feel pain?

31:04.931 --> 31:07.233
I'm afraid that's
all she feels.

31:07.266 --> 31:09.401
Her EEG shows
no active thoughts,

31:09.435 --> 31:12.604
but her primitive brain
functions are still intact.

31:12.638 --> 31:16.608
Her body senses and responds
to painful stimuli.

31:16.642 --> 31:18.510
Is there any hope
she'll get better?

31:18.544 --> 31:21.647
No. Her condition will only
continue to deteriorate

31:21.680 --> 31:23.149
until some infection
kills her

31:23.182 --> 31:24.516
or life support's
turned off.

31:24.550 --> 31:26.885
I've got rounds.

31:31.290 --> 31:34.026
The jury needs
to know this.

31:35.361 --> 31:36.462
Summations are over.

31:36.495 --> 31:38.530
The judge is getting ready
to charge them.

31:38.564 --> 31:41.000
Then ask for delay.

31:41.033 --> 31:43.535
I don't have
any legal grounds.

31:45.404 --> 31:49.976
This baby's suffering
is not irrelevant.

31:52.344 --> 31:54.513
I'll see what I can do.

31:59.585 --> 32:01.153
Your Honor, the facts
in the case have changed,

32:01.187 --> 32:03.089
and the jury has a right
to hear them.

32:03.122 --> 32:04.323
What's changed?

32:04.356 --> 32:06.592
Lucy was in a coma then,
she's still in one now.

32:06.625 --> 32:09.195
She's brain-dead--
a ventilator is
breathing for her.

32:09.228 --> 32:12.231
That's tragic.
But you don't have grounds
to reopen the case.

32:12.264 --> 32:14.266
Evelyn Prichard is
on trial for assault,

32:14.300 --> 32:16.735
but when Lucy dies,
which she soon will,
it'll be murder.

32:16.768 --> 32:18.637
A murder charge
is only proper

32:18.670 --> 32:20.339
after life support
is turned off,

32:20.372 --> 32:23.142
and Evelyn Prichard has
no intention of doing that.

32:23.175 --> 32:24.543
Your Honor, the jury
should be allowed

32:24.576 --> 32:26.178
to consider newly
discovered evidence.

32:26.212 --> 32:27.613
Only if offered by the defense.

32:27.646 --> 32:29.748
The prosecution just gets
one bite of the apple.

32:29.781 --> 32:31.750
She's right.
I'm sorry, Counselor,

32:31.783 --> 32:33.685
the jury will have
to render its verdict

32:33.719 --> 32:35.687
based on the facts
already in evidence.

32:40.759 --> 32:43.395
I got your page.
What's the verdict?

32:43.429 --> 32:45.397
Hung jury,
hopelessly deadlocked.

32:45.431 --> 32:47.366
So you'll be
retrying Evelyn.

32:47.399 --> 32:48.600
Yeah, we start on Monday.

32:48.634 --> 32:51.170
The jury's going to hear
that Lucy's brain dead.

32:51.203 --> 32:53.305
Yeah, but I don't think
that it'll make a difference.

32:53.339 --> 32:54.773
You were right.

32:54.806 --> 32:56.275
Evelyn's too sympathetic.

32:56.308 --> 32:58.244
I'll never get a jury
to convict her.

33:01.247 --> 33:02.714
This woman's a murderer.

33:02.748 --> 33:05.184
Not as long as Lucy
is technically alive.

33:12.424 --> 33:13.759
"And good night to the old lady

33:13.792 --> 33:18.064
"whispering, 'Hush,
good night, stars,

33:18.097 --> 33:21.467
"good night, air,

33:21.500 --> 33:23.502
good night, noises everywhere.'"

33:27.106 --> 33:28.307
Why are you here?

33:30.109 --> 33:31.610
To see Lucy.

33:34.513 --> 33:36.515
Do you have children, Detective?

33:40.652 --> 33:42.254
I do. I have four.

33:45.591 --> 33:47.293
And I can't imagine

33:47.326 --> 33:50.396
the pain you're going through
to see your baby like this.

33:51.497 --> 33:54.166
What do you want from me?

33:57.569 --> 33:59.071
Let her go.

33:59.105 --> 34:01.807
So you can charge me
with murder?

34:01.840 --> 34:04.443
So we can end Lucy's pain.

34:06.512 --> 34:07.479
( sniffles )

34:07.513 --> 34:09.248
I believe that's up to God.

34:09.281 --> 34:10.582
So do I.

34:10.616 --> 34:13.252
I love my children,

34:13.285 --> 34:14.353
and if one of them was sick,

34:14.386 --> 34:17.223
I would do anything in the world
to make them better,

34:17.256 --> 34:21.560
but I would also pray to God
that if all hope were gone,

34:21.593 --> 34:25.197
he'd give me the strength
just to end their suffering.

34:28.700 --> 34:31.737
I love my daughter.

34:31.770 --> 34:34.806
If I lose her,
I might as well be dead, too.

34:51.257 --> 34:53.259
Detective Stabler,
your captain said

34:53.292 --> 34:55.827
you wanted to talk to me
about the Prichard case.

34:55.861 --> 34:58.830
I think the D.A.'s office should
fight to turn off life support.

34:58.864 --> 35:00.732
And what makes
you think

35:00.766 --> 35:02.901
Judge Preston would grant
such a motion?

35:02.934 --> 35:05.871
I read the papers.
A similar request was made
in California successfully

35:05.904 --> 35:07.506
when a father shook his son.

35:07.539 --> 35:09.141
And it was unsuccessful

35:09.175 --> 35:11.277
in Florida.
Parents are winning the fight

35:11.310 --> 35:13.312
to keep their comatose daughter
alive

35:13.345 --> 35:14.880
despite legal precedent.

35:14.913 --> 35:17.583
Lucy's doctor says
she'll never recover.

35:20.586 --> 35:22.621
What's this really about,
Detective?

35:22.654 --> 35:23.922
You fighting for Lucy

35:23.955 --> 35:26.358
or bringing Evelyn Prichard
to justice?

35:26.392 --> 35:29.761
I don't know if she's a grieving
mother who can't let go,

35:29.795 --> 35:32.464
or if she's just trying
to beat a murder rap.

35:32.498 --> 35:34.633
What I do know...

35:34.666 --> 35:36.902
is a little girl
is in constant pain

35:36.935 --> 35:41.807
and there is no hope
of her ever getting better.

35:43.842 --> 35:45.877
Okay, Detective.

35:45.911 --> 35:48.280
But Evelyn gave birth to her.

35:48.314 --> 35:50.882
Lucy is her flesh and blood.

35:50.916 --> 35:53.419
You be careful or they'll
paint us as baby killers.

35:56.955 --> 35:58.490
Why did you go over my head?

35:58.524 --> 36:00.892
I'm trying to do
what's right for
that child.

36:00.926 --> 36:02.127
So am I.

36:02.160 --> 36:05.197
But it's my case now, and it's
my choice, not yours, okay?

36:05.231 --> 36:06.698
You should have come
to me first.

36:06.732 --> 36:08.200
I apologize.
You're right.

36:08.234 --> 36:10.336
You've every right
to be pissed at me.

36:10.369 --> 36:13.539
Now, you tell me,
you think it's wrong
to stop life support?

36:13.572 --> 36:15.307
I'm not a mother,

36:15.341 --> 36:17.409
I don't know what I'd do
if she were my child.

36:17.443 --> 36:19.878
Welcome to
Special Victims.

36:19.911 --> 36:23.215
It's not always black and white.

36:26.452 --> 36:28.954
Removing Lucy Prichard
from life support

36:28.987 --> 36:31.457
is the only ethically
responsible option.

36:31.490 --> 36:32.958
This is reprehensible.

36:32.991 --> 36:35.561
She wants to kill the child
so she'll have a stronger case.

36:35.594 --> 36:38.264
It's my duty to represent
Lucy Prichard's
best interest.

36:38.297 --> 36:41.233
It's hardly in her
best interest to be dead.

36:41.267 --> 36:43.435
Every night I pray
she gets better,

36:43.469 --> 36:45.237
but Lucy is in God's
hands, not yours.

36:45.271 --> 36:48.640
BALTHUS:
We vehemently oppose
withdrawing life support.

36:48.674 --> 36:52.911
The prosecution wants
to execute a helpless child.

36:52.944 --> 36:54.380
Enough, Ms. Balthus.

36:54.413 --> 36:55.947
What grounds do you have

36:55.981 --> 36:58.550
to judicially supersede
a parent's right

36:58.584 --> 37:00.319
to make decisions
for the minor child?

37:00.352 --> 37:02.654
Mrs. Prichard's right
is nullified

37:02.688 --> 37:05.491
by her legal predicament.
Her judgment is biased

37:05.524 --> 37:08.360
because her own future rests
on her child's survival.

37:08.394 --> 37:10.829
Then prove to me
that cessation of life support

37:10.862 --> 37:13.299
is truly in Lucy's
best interests.

37:18.904 --> 37:22.374
Lucy has violent pain responses
and little more.

37:22.408 --> 37:24.510
When we touch her,
she has a seizure.

37:24.543 --> 37:26.712
What are her other
medical problems?

37:26.745 --> 37:28.747
Lucy's bones
have become demineralized.

37:28.780 --> 37:30.416
Can you tell us what that means?

37:30.449 --> 37:31.583
They're very brittle.

37:31.617 --> 37:34.720
Yesterday when a nurse
changed her diaper,

37:34.753 --> 37:36.488
it fractured her hip.

37:36.522 --> 37:37.889
Thank you, Doctor,
nothing further.

37:37.923 --> 37:39.425
JUDGE:
Your witness, Ms. Balthus.

37:39.458 --> 37:41.293
Dr. Morella,

37:41.327 --> 37:44.730
are you familiar with the case
of Estelle Sanchez?

37:44.763 --> 37:45.897
No.

37:45.931 --> 37:48.066
Richard Youst?

37:48.099 --> 37:50.302
Francine LeMott?

37:50.336 --> 37:52.338
No. They're not my patients.

37:52.371 --> 37:53.872
Well, thank God for that,

37:53.905 --> 37:57.976
because Estelle Sanchez
was in a coma for ten years,

37:58.009 --> 37:59.811
woke up and asked for pancakes.

37:59.845 --> 38:01.747
Richard Youst...

38:01.780 --> 38:03.782
Objection, Your Honor.

38:03.815 --> 38:05.917
Sustained. You've made your
point, Counselor. Move on.

38:05.951 --> 38:08.019
Isn't it true, Doctor,

38:08.053 --> 38:13.425
that people awake from so-called
persistent vegetative states

38:13.459 --> 38:14.660
years after the doctors

38:14.693 --> 38:16.662
have told the families
to give up hope?

38:16.695 --> 38:17.796
Every case
is different.

38:17.829 --> 38:20.599
But miracles happen.

38:20.632 --> 38:21.767
I wouldn't call them that.

38:21.800 --> 38:23.068
What would you
call them, then?

38:23.101 --> 38:24.970
Can science explain
the sudden recovery

38:25.003 --> 38:28.574
of all function in previously
non-responsive patients?

38:28.607 --> 38:29.708
No, but...

38:29.741 --> 38:31.910
It happens,
doesn't it?

38:33.779 --> 38:35.681
It can.

38:35.714 --> 38:37.949
Thank you.

38:37.983 --> 38:39.451
Redirect, Your Honor?

38:39.485 --> 38:41.787
You may proceed,
Counselor.

38:41.820 --> 38:44.423
Dr. Morella,

38:44.456 --> 38:46.792
can Lucy awaken as
the defense implies?

38:46.825 --> 38:50.061
No. She suffered permanent
and irreparable brain damage.

38:50.095 --> 38:53.832
Life support
is mechanically
keeping the shell

38:53.865 --> 38:55.767
of what was once
Lucy Prichard alive.

38:55.801 --> 38:59.438
Is there any hope
she can recover?

39:01.707 --> 39:04.042
No.

39:04.075 --> 39:09.848
So, in addition to seizures
and breaking bones,

39:09.881 --> 39:12.884
how would you describe
Lucy's life?

39:12.918 --> 39:16.154
I believe she's in constant,
excruciating pain.

39:16.187 --> 39:17.723
Enough!

39:17.756 --> 39:18.724
Evelyn...

39:18.757 --> 39:19.658
No, no, no!

39:19.691 --> 39:22.728
I... I don't want Lucy
to suffer anymore.

39:22.761 --> 39:25.731
Please, please
turn off the machines.

39:25.764 --> 39:26.965
JUDGE:
Ms. Balthus, explain

39:26.998 --> 39:28.767
to your client that
if she does consent

39:28.800 --> 39:30.502
to a cessation
of life support,

39:30.536 --> 39:31.737
she wi face
a murder charge.

39:31.770 --> 39:34.740
I don't... I don't care!

39:39.711 --> 39:42.581
I don't care.

39:42.614 --> 39:45.851
I did it.

39:45.884 --> 39:48.954
I'm so sorry.

39:48.987 --> 39:51.857
I love her.

39:51.890 --> 39:56.027
Please, please
turn off the machines.

40:01.066 --> 40:04.503
Detective,
you have to know

40:04.536 --> 40:07.105
I love my baby.

40:07.138 --> 40:11.009
Everything I did, I did for her.

40:11.042 --> 40:15.581
That night, I-I just wanted
a chance at a normal life again,

40:15.614 --> 40:18.116
with a man I loved.

40:18.149 --> 40:21.019
I've been so alone.

40:21.052 --> 40:24.590
I just wanted
a night to myself.

40:24.623 --> 40:26.024
At first,

40:26.057 --> 40:27.693
Lucy was sleeping peacefully,

40:27.726 --> 40:30.629
but then she woke up
and she wouldn't stop screaming

40:30.662 --> 40:35.100
and I was so angry.

40:35.133 --> 40:40.171
I shook her... over and over

40:40.205 --> 40:44.776
until she stopped crying.

40:44.810 --> 40:49.948
Then I put her down
and she smiled up at me.

40:51.650 --> 40:55.854
She seemed okay.

40:55.887 --> 40:58.790
After the doctor told me
that she'd been shaken,

40:58.824 --> 41:02.093
I just kept telling myself
that it couldn't be my fault!

41:02.127 --> 41:06.698
Oh, God,
I never meant to hurt her!

41:11.069 --> 41:13.071
( crying )

41:24.683 --> 41:26.117
Is it over?

41:26.151 --> 41:28.086
They turned
the machines off.

41:28.119 --> 41:30.756
Ten minutes later,
Lucy was gone.

41:30.789 --> 41:32.123
It was peaceful.

41:34.292 --> 41:36.294
Evelyn there?

41:36.327 --> 41:39.197
Corrections sent her down
from Bedford Hills.

41:40.866 --> 41:42.868
Give me your keys.
I'll drive you home.

41:48.640 --> 41:51.242
That's Maureen,
about Lucy's age.

41:53.144 --> 41:55.614
I'd just gotten out
of the Marines.

41:55.647 --> 41:58.550
I was unemployed.

41:58.584 --> 42:01.119
Kathy was pregnant again.

42:08.093 --> 42:09.595
One night she went out

42:09.628 --> 42:11.963
and I was home alone
with Maureen.

42:16.101 --> 42:17.068
She spilled grape juice

42:17.102 --> 42:19.838
all over this brand-new carpet
we just bought,

42:19.871 --> 42:22.140
which we couldn't afford
to buy.

42:24.209 --> 42:25.711
( sighs )

42:28.113 --> 42:31.650
I grabbed her arm to spank her,

42:31.683 --> 42:35.020
and she twisted away,
and I slapped her in the face.

42:39.190 --> 42:45.063
As my hand was coming down
the second time...

42:45.096 --> 42:47.198
this voice in my head said,
"Stop."

42:50.636 --> 42:53.104
So, I'm standing there,
in the middle of this room,

42:53.138 --> 42:56.041
holding the limp body
of my little girl.

42:57.776 --> 43:01.747
She starts crying and...
and I pick her up...

43:01.780 --> 43:05.150
and I just keep saying
over and over, "I'm sorry."

43:07.152 --> 43:08.787
"I'm sorry."

43:15.894 --> 43:19.698
( choked up ):
I could have killed my kid
over a lousy carpet.

43:19.731 --> 43:20.899
( sniffling )

43:27.272 --> 43:28.239
Come on.

44:00.438 --> 44:02.941
( wolf howling )
