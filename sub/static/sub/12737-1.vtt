02:41.544 --> 02:45.344
In such close quarters,
I feel compelled to introduce myself.

02:45.448 --> 02:49.009
I'm Thomas Renfield, Esquire.
Solicitor from London.

02:49.085 --> 02:50.484
English.

02:50.553 --> 02:54.011
My wife and I, we love the English.
Don't we, dear?

02:55.792 --> 02:59.421
I confess I'm not accustomed
to these Transylvanian roads.

03:00.630 --> 03:02.097
Feeling a bit queasy.

03:02.165 --> 03:05.362
Queasy? I tell driver to go slow.

03:07.937 --> 03:09.268
Driver...

03:11.474 --> 03:12.998
The sun is setting.

03:13.076 --> 03:16.568
We must make the village
before dark. Quick!

03:20.416 --> 03:22.407
Faster! Faster!

03:28.358 --> 03:29.985
Hold on, English!

03:42.138 --> 03:44.106
Yes, I quite understand.

03:50.880 --> 03:54.748
I say, driver, can you slow up a bit?

03:55.852 --> 03:57.410
Yes!

04:00.156 --> 04:01.487
Thank you.

04:20.709 --> 04:22.041
Thank you.

04:22.912 --> 04:25.039
Driver, don't take my luggage down.

04:25.114 --> 04:27.912
- I'm going on to Borgo Pass tonight.
- Yes.

04:30.954 --> 04:33.684
- What are you doing?
- Too dark.

04:34.090 --> 04:35.682
I go no further.

04:36.092 --> 04:38.151
From here on, you walk.

04:40.430 --> 04:43.263
You are going on tonight?

04:43.333 --> 04:45.927
- Yes, I'm going to the castle.
- Castle?

04:47.503 --> 04:50.301
Yes, I'm scheduled to meet Count Dracula.

04:50.606 --> 04:51.834
Dracula?

04:54.711 --> 04:56.042
Scheduled?

04:58.681 --> 05:01.206
Yes, I have business with the Count.

05:01.384 --> 05:02.942
No.

05:03.252 --> 05:05.777
- You must not go.
- Why not?

05:06.022 --> 05:08.923
Because we people
of the mountains believe...

05:09.025 --> 05:11.823
vampires live at the castle.

05:12.628 --> 05:14.892
- Vampires?
- Yes.

05:14.964 --> 05:16.932
They are the undead.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.128
They rise from the coffins...

05:20.536 --> 05:22.060
at night.

05:22.372 --> 05:23.430
Yes.

05:26.209 --> 05:29.372
They take the form of wolves or bats...

05:29.512 --> 05:33.209
and puncture the throats of their victims
with their teeth...

05:33.349 --> 05:38.252
and drink their blood.

05:40.923 --> 05:43.255
Surely that's just superstition.

05:43.726 --> 05:47.423
No. Madame Ouspenskaya is right.

05:47.764 --> 05:49.391
Please, my son...

05:50.066 --> 05:51.397
take this cross.

05:51.467 --> 05:53.128
No, thank you.

05:54.270 --> 05:55.965
Take the cross.

05:56.039 --> 05:59.270
Its holy love and spirit of goodness...

05:59.342 --> 06:03.938
will shield you from the lurking danger.

06:08.818 --> 06:10.809
No, really. No, thank you.

06:11.320 --> 06:14.585
- Damn it, take the cross.
- Of course.

06:15.591 --> 06:19.027
- That'll be 15 kopeks.
- Okay.

06:20.229 --> 06:23.255
Thank you.

06:41.851 --> 06:44.285
If I have to walk, I have to walk.

06:46.956 --> 06:51.620
No. Don't go. Please. I beg of you.

06:53.429 --> 06:56.159
But you don't understand. I'm expected.

06:56.833 --> 06:59.358
Well, ta.

08:11.774 --> 08:12.866
What?

08:23.019 --> 08:24.509
How do you do?

08:25.621 --> 08:29.057
I'm Thomas Renfield,
solicitor from London...

08:29.192 --> 08:32.092
to see Count Dracula.

08:37.700 --> 08:40.760
Oh, my. Oh, dear. Oh, no.

08:47.143 --> 08:49.611
Children of the night.

08:50.446 --> 08:53.347
What a mess they make.

08:54.450 --> 08:55.917
I am Count...

09:01.357 --> 09:02.688
Dracula.

09:04.060 --> 09:06.688
- Are you hurt?
- I am perfectly fine.

09:06.762 --> 09:09.663
It would take much more than that
to hurt me.

09:10.433 --> 09:11.525
Come.

09:32.021 --> 09:33.545
Come, Renfield.

09:43.366 --> 09:45.391
- Oh, dear.
- Renfield...

09:45.735 --> 09:47.293
don't dawdle.

09:47.603 --> 09:49.537
Be there in half a tick.

09:52.141 --> 09:53.199
Yes.

09:53.509 --> 09:55.568
Sorry, I was detained.

09:55.645 --> 09:59.604
Embarrassing, really. I thought
I saw you walk through the web...

09:59.715 --> 10:00.943
so I assumed I could.

10:01.017 --> 10:04.145
Then I thought to myself,
"Perhaps I can go around the other way."

10:04.220 --> 10:05.414
But, no.

10:06.989 --> 10:08.854
It was attached on all sides.

10:08.924 --> 10:12.621
- So I thought to myself...
- Renfield, I don't care.

10:19.602 --> 10:22.969
And now, if you are not too fatigued
from your journey...

10:23.039 --> 10:25.769
I'd like to discuss the purchase
of Carfax Abbey.

10:25.841 --> 10:29.106
Yes, of course.
I have the papers right here.

10:30.446 --> 10:31.777
Very good.

10:34.016 --> 10:35.449
There we are.

10:40.956 --> 10:43.720
- A bit dusty, isn't it?
- Yes, I like it.

10:44.360 --> 10:45.793
Sign here.

10:49.799 --> 10:51.061
And here.

10:52.168 --> 10:53.635
There we are.

10:54.270 --> 10:58.138
Yes, congratulations.
You're now the owner of Carfax Abbey.

10:58.207 --> 10:59.936
One copy for you...

11:00.276 --> 11:02.471
and one copy for me.

11:04.347 --> 11:07.180
- Are you all right?
- Yes, just a paper cut.

11:09.085 --> 11:10.347
Oh, dear.

11:14.523 --> 11:17.185
Don't worry,
I have hanky here somewhere.

11:17.259 --> 11:19.193
Let's see, where are we?

11:19.261 --> 11:20.922
How stupid of me.

11:22.398 --> 11:25.959
It's worse than I thought.
I must have nipped the vessel.

12:27.096 --> 12:29.087
My God.

12:29.365 --> 12:31.890
What are you doing to the furniture?

12:37.740 --> 12:39.571
What are you on about?

12:39.642 --> 12:41.507
What's all this, then?

12:41.977 --> 12:43.706
Who are you people?

12:44.413 --> 12:47.576
I'll have you know
that's my knee you're straddling.

12:47.650 --> 12:49.481
No, stop it at once.

12:50.719 --> 12:52.380
No, this is wrong.

12:54.890 --> 12:57.518
This is wrong, do you hear me? Wrong.

13:00.963 --> 13:04.899
Wrong me. Wrong me.
Wrong my brains out.

13:09.305 --> 13:11.068
Oh, yes!

13:21.884 --> 13:23.943
What is going on here?

13:25.020 --> 13:27.614
You think this makes me proud of you?

13:28.491 --> 13:31.688
Now go, whilst I make him my slave.

13:39.568 --> 13:41.502
And stop that.

13:48.277 --> 13:50.040
So, Renfield...

13:50.679 --> 13:53.648
do you feel better now?
You were having a nightmare.

13:53.716 --> 13:55.013
A nightmare?

13:55.084 --> 13:57.109
But it was so real, so vivid.

13:57.186 --> 14:00.121
Two voluptuous women grinding, heaving.

14:00.556 --> 14:02.285
How to describe it?

14:02.358 --> 14:05.327
- Have you ever been to Paris?
- Yes.

14:07.763 --> 14:12.223
Let me show you an old Transylvanian
method for relaxation.

14:13.269 --> 14:15.669
Look into my eyes.

14:17.106 --> 14:20.075
Your eyelids are getting heavy.

14:20.476 --> 14:22.103
You feel that...

14:22.845 --> 14:26.008
Renfield, you fell asleep too soon.

14:27.016 --> 14:28.984
I have more to tell you.

14:30.052 --> 14:31.280
Wake up.

14:33.088 --> 14:37.957
Now, you are feeling drowsy.

14:40.296 --> 14:42.560
What a simpleton.

14:44.900 --> 14:47.926
Renfield, forget about sleeping.

14:48.003 --> 14:49.470
Listen to me.

14:50.072 --> 14:55.032
You hear only my voice.
From this moment on, you are my slave.

14:55.344 --> 14:59.041
You will sacrifice everything for my safety.

14:59.882 --> 15:01.782
In return...

15:02.084 --> 15:04.177
I will give you lives.

15:04.253 --> 15:06.312
Not big lives.

15:06.388 --> 15:11.052
Insects, flies, spiders.

15:11.393 --> 15:14.123
I have chartered a ship
to take us to England.

15:14.196 --> 15:16.391
We'll leave tomorrow evening.

15:16.899 --> 15:18.730
I command you.

15:19.134 --> 15:21.932
Watch over the safety of my coffin.

15:22.705 --> 15:24.696
Yes, master.

15:55.104 --> 15:57.436
Renfield!

16:06.248 --> 16:08.648
I'm coming, master.

16:09.685 --> 16:13.143
Master, don't worry. I'll help you.

16:26.435 --> 16:28.460
I have you now, master.

16:44.920 --> 16:47.912
You look poorly, master.
You're all dried out.

16:48.457 --> 16:50.789
Here, you should have fluids.

16:50.859 --> 16:52.486
Yes, I agree.

16:53.362 --> 16:56.991
I think I will start with the first mate.

17:30.599 --> 17:33.329
It makes me so happy to be at the opera.

17:33.802 --> 17:36.703
I love this palace of art and beauty.

17:36.772 --> 17:38.000
Yes, my dear.

17:38.073 --> 17:40.337
The opera is astonishing.

17:41.110 --> 17:44.045
The music is fraught with love, hate...

17:44.279 --> 17:46.770
sensuality, and unbridled passion.

17:47.549 --> 17:50.814
All the things in my life
I've managed to suppress.

17:52.621 --> 17:54.680
Sorry I'm late, my dear.

17:54.757 --> 17:58.318
- We were worried, Father.
- Sorry. Sit.

17:59.361 --> 18:01.386
I was detained at my asylum.

18:01.463 --> 18:04.091
The most extraordinary lunatic
was brought in today.

18:04.166 --> 18:07.795
The only man found alive on that schooner
that drifted into Whitby Harbor.

18:07.870 --> 18:09.394
Absolutely bizarre.

18:09.471 --> 18:12.065
Hello. Can I help you, sir?

18:12.141 --> 18:14.769
Yes, you may help me.

18:15.210 --> 18:17.405
Dr. Seward is in the next box.

18:17.479 --> 18:20.915
It is imperative that I meet with him alone.

18:23.452 --> 18:27.081
You will tell him
there is a message for him in the lobby.

18:27.623 --> 18:31.787
A message for Dr. Seward in the lobby.

18:32.227 --> 18:34.127
Good. Now go.

18:34.329 --> 18:38.026
Message in the lobby for Dr. Seward.

18:39.134 --> 18:42.160
And you will remember nothing...

18:42.237 --> 18:44.296
of what I tell you.

18:55.417 --> 18:56.907
Extraordinary.

18:58.187 --> 19:00.747
Hello. Can I help you, sir?

19:01.190 --> 19:04.489
"Can I help you, sir?"
What is the matter with you?

19:04.560 --> 19:07.427
- Why did you not tell him?
- About what?

19:07.830 --> 19:09.855
About the message.

19:10.499 --> 19:11.989
For whom?

19:12.301 --> 19:15.429
Never mind. I will tell him myself.

19:16.038 --> 19:18.700
And for your miserable performance...

19:18.774 --> 19:20.765
you will receive no tip.

19:21.210 --> 19:22.802
No tip?

19:23.812 --> 19:25.439
That you remember.

19:27.816 --> 19:29.443
Look what's in here.

19:32.955 --> 19:34.320
Excuse me...

19:34.389 --> 19:38.826
are you the Dr. Seward
whose sanitarium is in Whitby?

19:39.161 --> 19:42.597
- Why, yes.
- I have just purchased Carfax Abbey...

19:42.664 --> 19:45.895
and I understand it adjoins your grounds.

19:46.034 --> 19:48.025
Quite so. And you are?

19:48.804 --> 19:50.101
Forgive me.

19:50.172 --> 19:52.572
I am so renowned in my own country...

19:52.641 --> 19:56.042
I sometimes forget to introduce myself.

19:56.278 --> 19:59.304
- I am Count...
- Dr. Seward...

20:00.015 --> 20:03.314
there is a message for you in the lobby.

20:03.385 --> 20:05.182
Dear God. What is...

20:05.287 --> 20:07.448
Oh, bother. Excuse me.

20:08.490 --> 20:10.720
Dracula.

20:11.360 --> 20:13.885
How do you do, Count Dracula?

20:13.962 --> 20:16.590
I'm Jonathan Harker,
Dr. Seward's assistant.

20:16.665 --> 20:19.031
This is Lucy Westenra...

20:19.101 --> 20:22.537
and this is my fiancée,
Dr. Seward's daughter, Mina.

20:23.005 --> 20:25.974
Count Dracula, it will be a relief
to see lights burning...

20:26.041 --> 20:29.067
through those dismal windows
of Carfax Abbey once again.

20:29.444 --> 20:33.540
Oh, yes. The Abbey always reminds me
of that old toast, you know:

20:33.715 --> 20:37.151
"Lofty timbers,
the walls around are bare...

20:37.419 --> 20:39.387
"echoing to our laughter...

20:39.922 --> 20:41.787
"as though the dead were there."

20:41.857 --> 20:44.758
I like the way you think, my dear.

20:45.294 --> 20:48.195
That is one of my favorite subjects.

20:48.297 --> 20:51.494
We must get together
and have a long discussion.

20:52.100 --> 20:54.432
Very long.

20:54.770 --> 20:58.035
Now I take my leave.
I have a pressing appointment.

21:04.479 --> 21:05.969
Count Dracula?

21:07.616 --> 21:09.106
I'm sorry, my dear...

21:09.184 --> 21:13.348
but you have
such a lovely ucipital mapilary.

21:14.489 --> 21:15.888
What's that?

21:19.294 --> 21:20.386
This.

21:23.332 --> 21:24.663
Thank you.

21:25.901 --> 21:28.062
And now I take my leave.

21:34.643 --> 21:38.773
There's something otherworldly
about that man.

21:39.648 --> 21:42.549
- He gives me the shivers.
- Oh, yes.

21:43.418 --> 21:44.612
Me, too.

21:59.901 --> 22:01.493
Count Dracula...

22:02.871 --> 22:07.331
wish we could have that long talk
right now.

23:45.006 --> 23:46.371
Excuse us, my dear.

23:46.441 --> 23:48.432
Dr. Seward, Jonathan.

23:49.411 --> 23:50.935
I was sleeping.

23:51.379 --> 23:54.473
We're sorry, but we heard a noise
in the bushes below your window.

23:54.549 --> 23:58.110
- We thought it might be a prowler.
- Would you mind if we had a look about?

23:58.186 --> 24:00.086
No. Please do.

24:06.061 --> 24:08.928
- Nothing out here.
- Nothing amiss here, either.

24:09.331 --> 24:10.593
What a relief.

24:10.665 --> 24:13.998
I'm very confident
there's no danger here whatsoever.

24:20.342 --> 24:22.071
Sorry to disturb you, dear.

24:22.144 --> 24:25.807
We've searched every inch of the room,
and there's no sign of forcible entry.

24:25.881 --> 24:27.849
- Good night.
- Good night.

24:29.317 --> 24:30.784
Something wrong with this latch.

24:30.852 --> 24:34.379
Not to worry. I'll give it a jolly good slam.

25:35.817 --> 25:37.079
Renfield.

25:37.619 --> 25:40.383
- Yes?
- I can't take it. Can you take it?

25:40.722 --> 25:44.783
The lights, the screaming,
the crazy faces staring at me.

25:45.026 --> 25:47.517
I tell you, the walls are closing in on me.

25:47.596 --> 25:50.997
- I've got to get out of here.
- Guard, get back to work.

25:51.499 --> 25:52.761
Yes, sir.

26:06.781 --> 26:11.013
Come along then, Renfield.
You're going to have tea with the guvnor.

26:11.086 --> 26:12.314
At last.

26:12.487 --> 26:14.148
Now you'll see, Martin.

26:14.222 --> 26:16.918
Dr. Seward will believe I'm not insane.

26:17.025 --> 26:20.552
I wouldn't bet me last shilling on it.
Let's go.

26:32.841 --> 26:33.933
Stay.

26:37.912 --> 26:39.675
- Dr. Seward.
- Yes?

26:39.748 --> 26:43.275
- Mr. Renfield is here.
- Good. Send him out, Martin.

26:44.052 --> 26:47.078
McManus, the patient in the west wing?

26:47.155 --> 26:49.646
- Yes.
- He's having a conniption fit.

26:51.192 --> 26:52.853
Give him an enema.

26:53.962 --> 26:55.987
- An enema?
- Yes.

26:56.464 --> 26:59.160
It will give him a feeling
of accomplishment.

26:59.234 --> 27:00.496
Yes, sir.

27:03.271 --> 27:05.034
Renfield, good of you to come.

27:05.106 --> 27:07.438
Good to see you, old chap.
How are you feeling?

27:07.509 --> 27:09.636
Normal. Perfectly normal.

27:09.711 --> 27:11.338
- Excellent.
- Yes.

27:11.913 --> 27:16.145
Dr. Seward, may I ask
why I've been brought to the sanitarium?

27:16.217 --> 27:19.516
We would like to perform a few tests,
that's all, if you don't mind.

27:19.587 --> 27:23.079
No, not at all.
As you can see, I'm quite all right now.

27:23.191 --> 27:25.625
Quite so. Hungry?

27:25.694 --> 27:27.491
- Famished.
- Help yourself.

27:27.562 --> 27:29.189
- Such a bounty.
- Yes.

27:31.866 --> 27:33.731
I was just telling...

27:34.369 --> 27:35.859
What was that?

27:36.471 --> 27:39.065
- You grabbed something from the table.
- I did not.

27:39.140 --> 27:41.802
You did. I saw you.
You put it in your mouth.

27:41.876 --> 27:43.468
I think it was an insect.

27:43.812 --> 27:45.473
That was a raspberry.

27:45.547 --> 27:48.345
Raspberry? We're not serving raspberries.

27:49.050 --> 27:52.076
Then it must have been a raisin.
It fell off a muffin.

27:52.153 --> 27:54.314
- There seems to be one missing.
- It's missing?

27:54.389 --> 27:57.256
- Really? Of course.
- Only a raisin.

27:57.325 --> 27:59.384
How extraordinary.

28:00.462 --> 28:03.454
Silly me, it must have been
my imagination...

28:03.698 --> 28:05.529
There, you did it again.

28:05.600 --> 28:09.366
You just put a bug in your mouth.
I think it was a spider.

28:09.437 --> 28:11.428
- I did not.
- Yes, you did.

28:14.843 --> 28:19.075
I tell you, I saw you snatch a spider
right out of the air and eat it.

28:19.247 --> 28:22.683
A spider? How absurd.

28:27.856 --> 28:28.948
What?

28:29.224 --> 28:31.818
- Dropped my fork.
- Dropped it? You flung it.

28:31.893 --> 28:33.690
What's the matter with you?

28:33.762 --> 28:37.323
Mr. Renfield, I'll ask you
what are you doing down there?

28:37.599 --> 28:38.964
Fork found.

28:39.334 --> 28:43.236
- This is most unseemly. I don't think...
- Sorry for the delay.

28:45.840 --> 28:47.239
My God, man.

28:47.442 --> 28:50.275
You're eating insects
right from the ground.

28:50.345 --> 28:51.607
What makes you say that?

28:51.679 --> 28:55.115
Because I can see one
trying to get out of your mouth.

28:55.250 --> 28:58.549
- Out of my mouth?
- Yes, your very own mouth.

28:58.620 --> 29:00.884
- It's wriggling about.
- Don't be ridiculous.

29:00.955 --> 29:03.253
It's wriggling all over the place.

29:03.324 --> 29:06.020
Poor thing, it's fighting for its life.

29:07.962 --> 29:11.796
I don't know what you're talking about.
If you keep ranting, I'm going to leave.

29:11.866 --> 29:13.857
Me ranting? You're the ranter!

29:13.935 --> 29:16.995
Hello, little darling. Don't be afraid.

29:19.941 --> 29:22.068
- He's cracking.
- I won't hurt you.

29:22.143 --> 29:25.635
- Don't hurt me.
- All I want is your life!

29:26.181 --> 29:27.876
Martin!

29:31.286 --> 29:34.380
Put him in a straitjacket
and give him an enema.

29:34.456 --> 29:36.981
Wait. Give him an enema first...

29:37.192 --> 29:39.319
then put him in a straitjacket.

29:39.661 --> 29:41.288
- Yes, sir.
- Lives!

29:47.836 --> 29:49.827
Lucy, you lazy girl.

29:50.472 --> 29:53.737
It's past 10:00.
The horses are saddled and waiting.

29:58.546 --> 30:02.482
Mina, I don't think
I could put a foot out of bed today.

30:03.852 --> 30:05.843
I had such horrid dreams.

30:08.122 --> 30:10.818
I feel completely drained.

30:10.892 --> 30:12.484
Darling, you're dreadfully pale.

30:12.560 --> 30:14.755
You look absolutely peaked.

30:14.829 --> 30:18.390
- Perhaps Father should have a look at you.
- Yes, perhaps.

30:28.776 --> 30:29.936
- Father.
- Yeah.

30:30.011 --> 30:32.138
- It's Lucy.
- What's the matter with her?

30:32.213 --> 30:35.182
I don't know.
She's frightfully pale and wan.

30:35.250 --> 30:37.684
Pale? Wan? I best have a look.

30:43.925 --> 30:47.190
I've given you some laudanum, dear.
It will help you sleep.

30:48.496 --> 30:50.589
I see no sign of infection.

30:50.999 --> 30:53.797
Are you sure you don't remember
where these marks came from?

30:53.868 --> 30:55.995
An insect? Perhaps a spider.

30:56.437 --> 30:58.405
Do you recall being bitten?

30:58.473 --> 31:01.738
No. But I had a dream.

31:02.143 --> 31:03.337
Yes?

31:03.878 --> 31:05.743
What about that dream?

31:06.147 --> 31:07.978
I remember nothing.

31:14.122 --> 31:15.589
She's asleep.

31:16.291 --> 31:18.418
I must confess I'm completely confounded.

31:18.493 --> 31:22.088
I'm going to take the liberty
of contacting Prof. Abraham Van Helsing.

31:22.163 --> 31:23.460
Van Helsing?

31:23.531 --> 31:25.999
I thought he was
a metaphysician and philosopher.

31:26.067 --> 31:30.128
He's also a medical doctor. Knows more
about obscure diseases than anyone else.

31:30.204 --> 31:32.263
He may be the only man who can help us.

31:32.340 --> 31:34.205
Yes. Contact him, Father.

31:34.275 --> 31:36.607
- Contact him straight away.
- Yes.

31:48.690 --> 31:53.457
Gentlemen, you are about to observe
your first autopsy.

31:54.529 --> 31:57.760
It's not unusual
for some members of the freshman class...

31:57.832 --> 32:01.097
to feel a bit faint during this procedure.

32:02.003 --> 32:06.406
So this is where we begin to separate
our future physicians...

32:06.874 --> 32:10.037
from those who just want to play doctor.

32:10.578 --> 32:13.046
Now, first things first.

32:13.214 --> 32:16.342
We uncover the corpse.

32:19.354 --> 32:22.517
We make an incision from the groin...

32:23.625 --> 32:26.321
to the upper chest cavity, there.

32:30.598 --> 32:32.964
Now, as I open...

32:33.301 --> 32:36.793
the abdominal wall, you will observe...

32:36.871 --> 32:40.466
that the organs
have gone from a nice healthy pink...

32:40.808 --> 32:43.242
to a disgusting green.

32:45.179 --> 32:47.841
We must check the intestines...

32:47.915 --> 32:50.281
for pathological clues.

32:50.685 --> 32:51.777
So...

32:55.490 --> 32:57.617
Here, pass it along.

32:57.692 --> 33:00.991
Don't worry, there's plenty to go around.

33:09.504 --> 33:12.405
No one seems to be standing.

33:12.807 --> 33:17.244
Hello. I am still standing,
Professor Van Helsing.

33:19.681 --> 33:21.308
Woodbridge, right?

33:21.949 --> 33:23.974
Come closer, Woodbridge.

33:24.118 --> 33:26.882
Good for you. Staunch fellow.

33:27.855 --> 33:31.291
Why don't we have a look at the brain?

33:33.695 --> 33:38.257
First, we crack open the skull.

33:39.033 --> 33:40.193
So...

33:41.636 --> 33:46.300
behold the naked human brain.

33:47.075 --> 33:48.440
Examine it.

33:54.682 --> 33:56.775
A good morning's work.

34:00.354 --> 34:01.446
Come.

34:05.293 --> 34:08.387
Professor, 10 out of 10.

34:08.663 --> 34:11.257
Yeah. I still got it.

34:12.867 --> 34:15.233
I have a message for you from Dr. Seward.

34:15.303 --> 34:18.295
A message from Dr. Seward?
What does he say?

34:18.773 --> 34:21.297
He wants you to come
to Whitby immediately.

34:21.375 --> 34:23.036
It's an emergency.

34:23.444 --> 34:25.536
An emergency?

34:27.014 --> 34:30.040
Yes, sir. An emergency.

34:44.599 --> 34:46.760
I am awake.

34:48.369 --> 34:49.927
I'm awake during the daytime?

34:50.004 --> 34:52.734
What is happening?
I cannot be up during the daylight.

34:54.342 --> 34:56.503
It must be the young blood
from Miss Lucy.

34:56.577 --> 34:58.602
Her blood is still in my system.

34:59.347 --> 35:02.839
Is it possible she has cured me?

35:06.821 --> 35:09.949
Yes. I am cured.

35:10.191 --> 35:13.786
Now I can be up night and day.

35:17.365 --> 35:20.357
It is so bright...

35:20.802 --> 35:22.861
so many colors...

35:23.070 --> 35:26.403
and the sun is so warm.

35:27.441 --> 35:29.773
Hello, young lovers.

35:30.211 --> 35:32.679
I could not help but smell
your lovely picnic.

35:32.747 --> 35:36.046
Could I presume to ask you
for a piece of your chicken?

35:36.117 --> 35:37.744
Surely, sir.

35:38.686 --> 35:42.520
- Some wine, sir?
- I never drink wine.

35:44.659 --> 35:47.127
What the hell. Let me try it.

35:52.700 --> 35:54.031
It's good.

35:54.602 --> 35:56.092
Master!

35:56.170 --> 36:00.539
Renfield, look at me.
I'm drinking wine and eating chicken.

36:00.608 --> 36:02.667
What are you doing out in the daytime?

36:02.743 --> 36:06.008
Relax, Renfield. I am cured.

36:06.080 --> 36:08.480
No, you're not. Look.

36:10.084 --> 36:14.453
I made a mistake.
I've got to get back to my coffin.

36:27.034 --> 36:30.697
It's nighttime. Then it wasn't real.

36:32.974 --> 36:36.137
I was having a daymare.

36:42.149 --> 36:46.916
Three tiny puncture marks on her throat.

36:47.889 --> 36:49.049
Three?

36:52.627 --> 36:53.685
Two.

36:54.195 --> 36:58.097
Two tiny puncture marks on her throat.

36:59.300 --> 37:01.495
What does it mean, Professor?

37:02.003 --> 37:05.598
Gentlemen, what I am about to say...

37:06.340 --> 37:08.501
will shake the very foundation...

37:08.876 --> 37:11.572
of every medical precept you hold dear.

37:12.880 --> 37:16.873
We have entered
the realm of the supernatural.

37:20.054 --> 37:21.487
Supernatural?

37:21.555 --> 37:23.887
- Realm of the supernatural?
<i>- Ja.</i>

37:24.492 --> 37:26.483
Lucy has been attacked...

37:26.694 --> 37:29.857
by a creature that rises from its grave...

37:30.031 --> 37:32.158
and sucks the blood of the living...

37:32.233 --> 37:35.862
in order to prolong
its own unholy existence.

37:37.204 --> 37:40.401
What we are dealing with here is...

37:43.144 --> 37:44.509
a vampire.

37:44.912 --> 37:46.971
- Vampire?
- Vampire?

37:47.048 --> 37:48.515
What are you saying?

37:48.616 --> 37:50.345
I'm saying, "vampire."

37:50.718 --> 37:54.814
Professor, modern science
does not admit to such a fanciful creature.

37:55.156 --> 37:57.556
Modern science, pish posh.

37:57.892 --> 38:00.360
She has lost a great deal of blood, <i>ja?</i>

38:00.428 --> 38:02.020
<i>- Ja.</i>
- Yet, look.

38:04.832 --> 38:06.925
Where did all the blood go?

38:07.301 --> 38:09.895
Look at the sheet, the pillowcase,
her nightgown.

38:09.971 --> 38:11.632
Do you see anything?

38:12.039 --> 38:14.872
How does your modern science
explain "zat?"

38:15.076 --> 38:18.045
Can you explain "zat?"

38:18.112 --> 38:20.842
I can't explain "zat."

38:20.915 --> 38:22.815
No one can explain "zat!"

38:24.085 --> 38:25.780
Are you asking us to believe...

38:25.853 --> 38:28.617
that some creature
just flew in through that window...

38:28.689 --> 38:31.624
bit Lucy on the neck,
and drank of her blood?

38:32.860 --> 38:34.088
Exactly.

38:34.996 --> 38:36.486
And tonight...

38:37.098 --> 38:40.465
the foul thing will return.

38:41.569 --> 38:44.800
It will suck on her life's fluid...

38:45.106 --> 38:49.270
until it has drained her of every last drop.

38:52.013 --> 38:53.674
And if she dies...

38:53.981 --> 38:57.212
a victim of this unspeakable creature...

38:58.052 --> 39:01.681
she will become one herself.

39:02.690 --> 39:03.850
What?

39:04.358 --> 39:08.021
She will become one herself.

39:10.431 --> 39:13.423
What can we do
to protect her from this fiend?

39:14.802 --> 39:16.292
- Seward.
- Yes?

39:17.471 --> 39:19.996
Do you have any books on the occult?

39:21.342 --> 39:22.775
They're right here.

39:22.843 --> 39:25.869
- Do you have <i>Transylvanian Folklore?</i>
- No.

39:26.380 --> 39:29.543
Do you have <i>The Theory</i>
<i>and the Theology of the Evil Undead?</i>

39:29.617 --> 39:30.641
No.

39:31.085 --> 39:34.213
- Do you have <i>The Vampires of Prague?</i>
- No.

39:35.423 --> 39:37.323
Do you have <i>Nosferatu?</i>

39:37.691 --> 39:42.094
Yes, we have <i>Nosferatu.</i>
We have <i>Nosferatu</i> today.

39:42.163 --> 39:45.496
- It just came in the post.
- Here, give it to me, quick.

39:49.837 --> 39:50.929
Here.

39:51.105 --> 39:53.665
- There is a way to protect her.
- How?

39:54.408 --> 39:57.206
"The creature is repelled by garlic.

39:57.611 --> 40:00.774
"Lts purifying effect is anathema...

40:01.415 --> 40:04.816
"to the tainted soul of the vampire."

40:20.901 --> 40:24.337
I must move the coffin or the chandelier.

40:28.542 --> 40:31.534
We brought you down here
so you'll be closer to us, my dear.

40:31.612 --> 40:33.739
We'll be just down the hall in the study.

40:33.814 --> 40:37.773
You must get a good night's rest
to regain your strength, my dear.

40:37.918 --> 40:40.614
It's the only way to improve your health.

40:40.688 --> 40:42.178
Would an enema help?

40:46.393 --> 40:47.883
Come, we must go.

40:54.168 --> 40:56.033
Sleep well, Miss Lucy.

40:56.403 --> 40:58.530
The garlic will protect you.

41:36.844 --> 41:38.038
Garlic.

42:00.167 --> 42:02.431
- Renfield.
- Master?

42:04.505 --> 42:08.100
It is time for you to serve your master.

42:08.909 --> 42:11.036
- Come.
- Yes, master.

42:11.111 --> 42:13.807
Those meddling idiots.

42:14.782 --> 42:18.650
They want to prevent me
from entering Miss Lucy's bedroom.

42:18.953 --> 42:21.945
- I want to take...
- Wait, master.

42:32.633 --> 42:34.328
All right, I'm listening.

42:34.902 --> 42:38.531
They have placed garlands of garlic
around her room.

42:39.039 --> 42:42.202
What can I do, master?
I can't leave this cell.

42:42.509 --> 42:45.740
Do you imagine I could not
take you out of here if I wish?

42:45.879 --> 42:49.076
That these pathetic bars could stop me?

42:49.883 --> 42:52.317
Wait, master. I'm getting such a headache.

42:52.386 --> 42:56.345
How dare they try to match wits with me?

42:56.724 --> 42:59.784
Me, who has commanded
the forces of darkness.

42:59.927 --> 43:03.488
Me, who has called forth
the demons of the night to do my bidding.

43:03.764 --> 43:08.258
Me, who has destroyed every enemy
down through the centuries.

43:12.072 --> 43:14.700
Renfield? I'm talking to you.

43:15.676 --> 43:18.509
- Sorry, master.
- Come.

43:20.214 --> 43:24.082
We have much to do,
and less time to do it in.

43:33.527 --> 43:35.119
Renfield, hurry.

43:46.774 --> 43:51.040
Renfield, I meant for you
to use the drain pipe.

43:51.612 --> 43:53.637
I fly, you don't.

43:54.114 --> 43:55.775
Yes, of course.

43:55.983 --> 43:57.974
- Come.
- He flies, I don't.

45:03.150 --> 45:06.449
Renfield, you idiot.

45:08.889 --> 45:10.516
Grab him, Harker.

45:11.225 --> 45:14.353
I'm weak. I strayed.

45:14.495 --> 45:15.792
What did he do?

45:15.929 --> 45:19.092
I caught him lifting up the sheets
and looking at me.

45:19.666 --> 45:22.635
Nothing but a filthy pervert. Martin.

45:23.170 --> 45:24.569
Here you are.

45:24.638 --> 45:27.732
Take him back to his cell
and give him a you-know-what.

45:27.808 --> 45:31.209
No, not another enema.

45:32.346 --> 45:35.838
Yes, another and another
until you come to your senses.

45:36.750 --> 45:38.718
- I'll close the window.
- Yes.

45:46.960 --> 45:48.188
Good lad.

45:48.262 --> 45:50.958
- Are you all right, dear?
- Yes. I'm fine, Dr. Seward...

45:51.031 --> 45:53.693
apart from this ghastly garlic.

45:53.767 --> 45:56.201
I'm sorry, dear, but Van Helsing insists.

45:56.270 --> 45:58.704
Oh, Lord!

46:03.177 --> 46:04.701
Lucy...

46:05.512 --> 46:07.742
I command you...

46:08.749 --> 46:10.910
open the window.

46:11.452 --> 46:12.544
Come.

46:14.254 --> 46:17.451
Get in there, you filthy degenerate!

46:17.524 --> 46:19.890
I didn't see anything!

46:21.361 --> 46:23.989
I saw everything.

46:47.821 --> 46:51.257
- It's Lucy. Someone was attacking her.
- Wait here.

46:58.799 --> 47:00.164
How is she?

47:00.934 --> 47:02.902
- She's dead.
- Dead?

47:03.704 --> 47:06.400
The vampire has taken all of her blood.

47:07.107 --> 47:10.270
I told her not to leave
the safety of the garlic.

47:21.321 --> 47:24.290
No. It's absolutely absurd.

47:24.358 --> 47:28.226
I tell you, we must drive
a wooden stake through her heart.

47:28.629 --> 47:32.429
Or else she will rise from her grave
to seek the blood of the living.

47:32.499 --> 47:34.399
Lucy was my ward.

47:34.535 --> 47:37.732
I won't permit you to desecrate her body
in such a vile manner.

47:37.804 --> 47:39.135
It's sacrilegious.

47:39.206 --> 47:43.336
But, Dr. Seward, shouldn't we at least
stand guard over Lucy's grave...

47:43.410 --> 47:45.344
- just to make sure?
- No.

47:45.946 --> 47:49.006
I'm having serious doubts
about this whole vampire theory.

47:49.082 --> 47:51.346
For heaven's sake, who in all of England...

47:51.418 --> 47:53.886
by the very furthest stretch
of the imagination...

47:53.954 --> 47:55.615
could possibly be a vampire?

47:55.689 --> 47:58.419
- Count Dracula.
- Well, maybe him.

48:01.261 --> 48:04.128
What? What are you... about?

48:04.998 --> 48:08.695
Count Dracula! Just talking about you,
favorably of course.

48:08.969 --> 48:10.368
Forgive my interruption...

48:10.437 --> 48:14.373
but I was just made aware
of the unfortunate passing of Miss Lucy.

48:15.075 --> 48:17.441
I wish to offer my condolences.

48:17.911 --> 48:21.005
- Thank you. We're all very distraught.
- Yes.

48:21.148 --> 48:23.173
Count Dracula, allow me to introduce...

48:23.250 --> 48:25.946
Prof. Abraham Van Helsing
of London University.

48:26.119 --> 48:29.646
He's a doctor of rare diseases,
as well as theology and philosophy.

48:29.723 --> 48:31.520
<i>Und</i> gynecology.

48:32.225 --> 48:35.126
I didn't know
you had your hand in that, too.

48:36.029 --> 48:40.693
Van Helsing, a name we know
even in the wilds of Transylvania.

48:41.234 --> 48:44.203
Count Dracula. Curious.

48:44.805 --> 48:49.504
Are you descended from Vlad Tepes,
the first Dracula?

48:49.643 --> 48:50.735
Tepes?

48:51.812 --> 48:55.578
It means "The lmpaler."
He was a bloodthirsty butcher...

48:55.782 --> 48:59.047
who inflicted unspeakable tortures
on the peasants.

48:59.319 --> 49:02.755
Cutting off their hands and feet,
gouging out their eyes...

49:02.856 --> 49:06.849
and then impaling them on iron spikes.

49:08.562 --> 49:10.154
They had it coming.

49:12.299 --> 49:14.290
What could they possibly have done...

49:14.368 --> 49:16.928
to deserve such barbaric
and inhuman treatment?

49:17.004 --> 49:18.028
Yes.

49:18.105 --> 49:20.039
We have a saying in the old country:

49:24.177 --> 49:25.576
They also said:

49:30.851 --> 49:35.151
I'm very impressed, Van Helsing.
You speak the ancient Moldavian.

49:39.860 --> 49:42.954
Well, gentlemen, I will take my...

49:44.798 --> 49:45.992
leave.

49:47.134 --> 49:51.730
I say, Van Helsing, you are a man
who likes to have the last word.

49:52.673 --> 49:56.507
I will not be drawn into
such a childish exercise.

49:59.279 --> 50:03.477
It is immaterial to me
who has the last word.

50:06.953 --> 50:08.545
It is getting late.

50:08.622 --> 50:11.591
We will carry on this conversation
at another time.

50:12.059 --> 50:14.152
Good night.

50:19.966 --> 50:21.934
Such arrogance.

50:22.869 --> 50:24.632
It is easy to see...

50:25.005 --> 50:28.304
why the decadent aristocracy
is dying out...

50:28.442 --> 50:30.342
in that part of the world.

50:33.246 --> 50:36.340
Gentlemen, our work is not done.

50:36.683 --> 50:38.651
The vampire is still among us.

50:38.719 --> 50:40.744
You must remember, he is cunning.

50:40.854 --> 50:43.152
He has the wisdom of centuries.

50:43.223 --> 50:46.317
And above all, he will never give up.

50:49.696 --> 50:53.063
That man! He never gives up.

50:55.969 --> 50:58.062
Never gives up.

50:58.872 --> 51:00.965
What are you thinking, Professor?

51:01.108 --> 51:04.635
- When did Count Dracula move in?
- About a month ago.

51:05.112 --> 51:07.945
And when did Miss Lucy's symptoms
first appear?

51:08.048 --> 51:09.242
About the same time.

51:09.316 --> 51:12.308
Are you saying
that Count Dracula is our vampire?

51:12.385 --> 51:15.047
Yes! And no.

51:15.122 --> 51:17.283
- Then what are you saying?
- I'm saying no.

51:17.357 --> 51:19.291
But I'm leaning towards yes.

51:19.359 --> 51:20.883
- Then you're saying yes.
- No.

51:20.961 --> 51:22.826
- Then it's no.
- Not necessarily.

51:22.896 --> 51:24.864
- You sound dubious.
- No, I'm positive.

51:24.931 --> 51:26.330
- Of what?
- My theory.

51:26.399 --> 51:30.301
- And that would be?
- The theory of yes or no.

51:41.715 --> 51:43.342
Good night, sweet lady.

51:44.684 --> 51:47.482
May angels' voices sing thee to thy rest.

51:48.655 --> 51:49.883
Help me.

51:51.458 --> 51:52.857
What's that?

51:54.995 --> 51:57.793
Help me, it's so dark in here.

52:00.267 --> 52:01.791
Who's in there?

52:02.068 --> 52:06.232
I'm alive. They've buried me alive.

52:07.774 --> 52:09.605
Saints preserve us.

52:10.277 --> 52:12.871
Don't worry, miss. I'm coming.

52:16.917 --> 52:18.282
Oh, my God!

52:18.985 --> 52:21.920
They made a mistake, a terrible mistake.

52:22.422 --> 52:26.188
Please help me. I'm so very cold.

52:28.528 --> 52:30.621
You'll be all right. You're alive.

52:48.048 --> 52:50.539
I say, Jonathan. What are you doing?

52:51.618 --> 52:53.210
Just for tonight...

52:53.286 --> 52:57.086
I'm going to stand guard at Lucy's grave,
as the Professor suggested.

52:57.290 --> 52:59.986
Surely you don't believe
this vampire business?

53:00.360 --> 53:02.487
I don't know what I believe.

53:02.562 --> 53:05.861
But on the odd chance
that Van Helsing's right...

53:05.932 --> 53:08.492
I should never forgive myself
if I didn't make sure.

53:08.568 --> 53:11.867
All right, go ahead.
But I think you're wasting your time.

53:13.573 --> 53:14.870
Poppycock.

54:01.855 --> 54:03.789
Jonathan.

54:24.010 --> 54:25.102
Lucy?

54:26.446 --> 54:28.778
Come away with me, Jonathan.

54:33.219 --> 54:35.585
I know you've always wanted me...

54:35.889 --> 54:38.119
and I have always wanted you.

54:38.258 --> 54:40.351
Finally we can be together.

54:41.594 --> 54:45.030
But, Lucy, I'm engaged to Mina...

54:45.966 --> 54:47.297
and you're dead.

54:47.968 --> 54:49.959
I'm not dead.

54:50.036 --> 54:52.334
I'm undead.

54:53.173 --> 54:56.631
Yes, well, I'm not unengaged...

54:57.877 --> 54:59.242
thank you.

55:00.246 --> 55:02.271
Jonathan, let me kiss you.

55:03.083 --> 55:07.247
Let me show you the deep, raw passion...

55:07.320 --> 55:10.983
of unbridled, sexual frenzy.

55:11.791 --> 55:14.385
But, Lucy, I'm British.

55:14.828 --> 55:16.455
But so are these.

55:23.103 --> 55:26.197
Now we can be together forever.

55:26.673 --> 55:27.662
Back.

55:31.678 --> 55:34.738
Back, unholy demon of the night.

55:40.353 --> 55:43.948
- After her! This is our chance.
- For what?

55:44.024 --> 55:48.051
To destroy her, my boy.
She's retreated to her crypt. Come!

55:58.138 --> 55:59.332
My God.

55:59.806 --> 56:02.206
- Now she's dead.
- No, she's not.

56:02.409 --> 56:05.537
- She's alive?
- She's Nosferatu.

56:06.246 --> 56:07.770
She's Italian?

56:08.081 --> 56:10.276
No, it means the undead.

56:10.383 --> 56:13.113
She's cursed to spend eternity in misery...

56:13.253 --> 56:15.915
hunting the living like a wild animal.

56:16.289 --> 56:17.950
What should we do?

56:18.024 --> 56:21.460
For the sake of her eternal soul,
we must destroy her.

56:22.128 --> 56:23.595
The only way...

56:23.663 --> 56:26.598
is to drive a wooden stake...

56:27.567 --> 56:29.228
through her heart.

56:29.302 --> 56:32.169
That's horrible. Is there no other way?

56:32.839 --> 56:36.240
One other. We could cut off her head...

56:36.576 --> 56:38.601
stuff her mouth with garlic...

56:38.812 --> 56:40.677
and tear off her ears.

56:42.282 --> 56:43.943
Give me the stake.

56:45.351 --> 56:48.912
Oh, no. No, I can't do it. You do it.

56:49.422 --> 56:52.858
It must be done
by one who loved her in life.

56:52.926 --> 56:55.326
- I only liked her.
- Close enough. Here.

56:56.096 --> 56:59.896
Good boy. You can do it. Here.

56:59.966 --> 57:03.697
Now place the point of the stake
directly over her heart...

57:03.937 --> 57:07.464
and hit as hard as you can.

57:09.342 --> 57:10.434
Wait!

57:14.013 --> 57:15.071
Now!

57:20.553 --> 57:24.045
Oh, my God!

57:25.058 --> 57:27.492
There's so much blood.

57:28.128 --> 57:29.595
She just ate.

57:32.632 --> 57:34.122
She's still alive.

57:34.334 --> 57:37.701
- Hit her again.
- No, I can't.

57:37.770 --> 57:40.068
How much blood can she have left?

57:41.474 --> 57:42.498
Go.

57:54.854 --> 57:56.879
She's almost dead.

57:58.892 --> 58:00.553
She's dead enough.

58:06.399 --> 58:09.766
- This is ghastly.
- Yes. You're right.

58:10.136 --> 58:12.468
We should have put newspapers down.

58:14.407 --> 58:16.170
What have I done?

58:16.242 --> 58:19.040
What have I done to poor Lucy?

58:19.846 --> 58:21.780
You have released her, my boy.

58:22.248 --> 58:25.513
Now she sleeps in peace forever.

58:26.019 --> 58:28.988
- Here. Clean yourself up.
- Thank you.

58:29.656 --> 58:31.021
Poor Lucy.

58:38.531 --> 58:39.623
Here.

58:41.401 --> 58:42.629
Keep it.

58:58.551 --> 58:59.882
Essie...

59:02.722 --> 59:05.919
your eyelids are growing heavy...

59:06.459 --> 59:08.051
with sleep.

59:08.995 --> 59:10.724
Sleep.

59:16.603 --> 59:20.972
Mina, open your eyes.

59:23.209 --> 59:25.677
Arise, Mina.

59:30.717 --> 59:32.981
Walk to the door.

59:40.827 --> 59:44.627
Mina, you are in the closet.

59:46.232 --> 59:49.963
Open the door and come out.

59:56.009 --> 59:59.342
Now walk to the terrace door.

01:00:02.048 --> 01:00:04.016
Watch out for the foot...

01:00:06.452 --> 01:00:07.612
stool.

01:00:09.756 --> 01:00:11.018
Stand up.

01:00:11.858 --> 01:00:13.348
Not you. Sit.

01:00:14.260 --> 01:00:16.091
No, not you. You sit.

01:00:16.763 --> 01:00:19.254
You stand. No, sit.

01:00:20.033 --> 01:00:21.523
No, you stand.

01:00:22.468 --> 01:00:25.960
You walk to the terrace door,
and you go back to sleep.

01:00:26.272 --> 01:00:27.603
Watch out!

01:00:32.545 --> 01:00:35.013
Wait. I'm coming.

01:00:35.948 --> 01:00:38.974
Turn out the lights, so no one will see me.

01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:50.724
You will be my bride throughout eternity.

01:00:50.863 --> 01:00:54.162
We'll share the endless passion
of immortal love.

01:00:54.233 --> 01:00:57.327
- Oh, I can't wait.
- Not you.

01:01:03.242 --> 01:01:05.540
You will be my bride throughout eternity.

01:01:05.611 --> 01:01:08.375
We'll share the endless passion
of immortal love.

01:01:09.549 --> 01:01:12.211
Oh, my boy. Such a night.

01:01:17.156 --> 01:01:20.751
- My God, man. What's happened to you?
- Everything.

01:01:21.260 --> 01:01:24.093
Professor Van Helsing
was absolutely right.

01:01:24.297 --> 01:01:27.460
Lucy rose from her grave and attacked me.

01:01:28.234 --> 01:01:30.725
And now, at last...

01:01:31.471 --> 01:01:33.371
she sleeps in peace.

01:01:33.606 --> 01:01:36.734
You mean Lucy
actually became a vampire?

01:01:37.343 --> 01:01:38.503
Yes.

01:01:38.611 --> 01:01:41.808
- Where's Mina?
- She's all right. Fast asleep.

01:01:41.881 --> 01:01:44.179
- Essie's sitting watch over her.
- Good.

01:01:44.250 --> 01:01:47.083
I'll just sit watch myself
in front of her door.

01:01:48.254 --> 01:01:50.518
Don't you think
you ought to get cleaned up first?

01:01:50.590 --> 01:01:52.558
Oh, yes. Quite right.

01:01:52.759 --> 01:01:55.557
Do you mind using the service entrance?

01:01:56.429 --> 01:01:58.158
There's a good chap.

01:01:58.731 --> 01:02:02.667
He's covered with blood
and there's not a drop on you. Why?

01:02:02.835 --> 01:02:05.395
I have been to many, many stakings.

01:02:06.172 --> 01:02:08.436
You have to know where to stand.

01:02:08.541 --> 01:02:12.272
You know, everything in life is location.

01:02:44.076 --> 01:02:48.137
And now we shall do the dance of love.

01:03:24.250 --> 01:03:25.979
You're good.

01:04:34.053 --> 01:04:35.520
No hickies.

01:05:03.516 --> 01:05:07.145
- Shouldn't we rouse her?
- Yes, perhaps you're right.

01:05:07.420 --> 01:05:08.478
Essie.

01:05:08.554 --> 01:05:11.148
Hello. I must have dropped off.

01:05:12.024 --> 01:05:14.151
Good gracious, it's morning.

01:05:14.360 --> 01:05:17.454
One moment I was on guard,
wide awake...

01:05:17.630 --> 01:05:19.723
and the next I felt like...

01:05:19.799 --> 01:05:23.257
a dark cloud came over me.

01:05:24.070 --> 01:05:26.163
- Are you all right?
- Fine.

01:05:26.606 --> 01:05:28.836
Here we are, then, safe and sound.

01:05:28.908 --> 01:05:31.536
It's getting on. I better see to breakfast.

01:05:33.145 --> 01:05:35.045
Where'd that come from?

01:05:38.718 --> 01:05:41.812
I had the most extraordinary dreams
last night.

01:05:42.488 --> 01:05:44.979
I feel so different.

01:05:45.791 --> 01:05:48.919
You look different, Mina.

01:05:51.530 --> 01:05:52.758
Come.

01:05:55.201 --> 01:05:56.634
Sit with me.

01:05:57.870 --> 01:05:59.030
Closer.

01:06:03.909 --> 01:06:06.275
Closer, you silly boy.

01:06:07.813 --> 01:06:10.304
Darling, we know each other so well...

01:06:10.383 --> 01:06:14.911
and yet we've never really
explored each other.

01:06:15.955 --> 01:06:17.354
Thank God.

01:06:17.690 --> 01:06:20.818
Jonathan, I've changed.
I'm not the Mina you knew.

01:06:21.227 --> 01:06:23.218
What do you mean, dearest?

01:06:23.462 --> 01:06:25.020
I want you to do something for me...

01:06:25.097 --> 01:06:27.258
something that
I've never asked you before.

01:06:27.333 --> 01:06:30.302
- Of course, my dear. Anything.
- Good.

01:06:31.337 --> 01:06:33.396
- Touch this.
- Don't mind if I do.

01:06:36.242 --> 01:06:37.732
What are you saying?

01:06:38.010 --> 01:06:40.706
All right, you don't have to touch anything.

01:06:41.547 --> 01:06:43.412
- I'll touch you.
- No!

01:06:46.218 --> 01:06:47.879
Stop this immediately.

01:06:48.287 --> 01:06:49.982
What's come over you?

01:06:50.289 --> 01:06:53.224
- I'm leaving.
- No, please, don't go.

01:06:53.426 --> 01:06:54.688
You're right.

01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:58.457
Something is wrong with me
and it's taking over my mind...

01:06:58.531 --> 01:07:00.829
and forcing me to say things
I would never say...

01:07:00.900 --> 01:07:03.300
and do things I would never do.

01:07:03.903 --> 01:07:05.632
Jonathan, please help me.

01:07:07.773 --> 01:07:10.264
Mina, yes. Anything. What can I do?

01:07:10.643 --> 01:07:11.905
Touch this.

01:07:12.678 --> 01:07:15.010
Good morning, Mina. How did you...

01:07:18.350 --> 01:07:20.784
Jonathan, take your hands off me.

01:07:21.087 --> 01:07:23.146
Yes, take your hands off her.

01:07:25.057 --> 01:07:26.183
Sorry, sir.

01:07:26.258 --> 01:07:28.192
You should be ashamed of yourself.

01:07:28.260 --> 01:07:29.727
But she made me do it.

01:07:29.795 --> 01:07:32.889
- Is that right, Mina?
- No, Father.

01:07:33.099 --> 01:07:36.865
Suddenly, without any reason at all,
he laid his hands on me.

01:07:37.002 --> 01:07:40.062
- She told me to touch it.
- Harker!

01:07:40.606 --> 01:07:44.007
You're a degenerate.
I take you into my home.

01:07:44.410 --> 01:07:48.039
You eat my food, drink my wine,
but that's not enough for you. Oh, no.

01:07:48.114 --> 01:07:50.844
After being engaged to my daughter
for only five years...

01:07:50.916 --> 01:07:53.680
you have the audacity to touch her.

01:07:54.553 --> 01:07:55.679
Get out.

01:07:55.955 --> 01:07:57.946
- But, sir...
- Out, I said!

01:07:59.558 --> 01:08:02.891
- What is happening here?
- Terrible doings.

01:08:02.962 --> 01:08:05.260
I found Harker
with his hands all over my daughter.

01:08:05.331 --> 01:08:09.131
But she forced me to, sir.
She's been behaving rather strangely.

01:08:09.201 --> 01:08:12.170
It's as though
she's been under some sort of a spell.

01:08:13.472 --> 01:08:14.769
Spell?

01:08:16.207 --> 01:08:19.200
That's a very lovely scarf
you're wearing, Miss Mina.

01:08:20.479 --> 01:08:22.947
Yes, I felt chilly this morning.

01:08:24.116 --> 01:08:25.447
Excuse me.

01:08:26.484 --> 01:08:29.147
May I have a look?

01:08:30.523 --> 01:08:32.115
Just as I thought.

01:08:32.957 --> 01:08:34.618
Like Lucy.

01:08:35.661 --> 01:08:37.185
No, it's nothing.

01:08:37.263 --> 01:08:39.959
I accidentally did it
while I was pinning a shawl.

01:08:40.032 --> 01:08:41.260
Really?

01:08:41.367 --> 01:08:43.767
I have something for you, Miss Mina.

01:08:44.103 --> 01:08:45.434
A present?

01:08:45.571 --> 01:08:48.596
Sort of. Hold out your hand.

01:08:49.108 --> 01:08:50.096
Here.

01:08:55.346 --> 01:08:56.439
Here.

01:08:56.982 --> 01:08:58.040
Look.

01:08:58.450 --> 01:08:59.678
What is that?

01:08:59.919 --> 01:09:02.944
It is proof, my unfortunate friend...

01:09:03.389 --> 01:09:05.983
that your daughter has been corrupted...

01:09:06.158 --> 01:09:08.388
by the evil of a vampire.

01:09:09.060 --> 01:09:12.656
We must find this vampire
before Mina meets the same fate as Lucy.

01:09:12.731 --> 01:09:14.358
But who is the vampire?

01:09:14.567 --> 01:09:17.832
Van Helsing suspects Count Dracula.
But it can also be Renfield.

01:09:17.903 --> 01:09:19.700
The man drinks the blood of insects...

01:09:19.772 --> 01:09:22.639
and bent the bars of his cell
like they were cheese.

01:09:22.741 --> 01:09:24.435
It could be anyone.

01:09:25.109 --> 01:09:28.375
There is a way, an indisputable way...

01:09:29.148 --> 01:09:31.981
to reveal the vampire.

01:09:50.636 --> 01:09:52.729
I'm going along with you on this,
Van Helsing...

01:09:52.805 --> 01:09:55.171
but I think this ball
is in extremely bad taste.

01:09:55.241 --> 01:09:58.642
Lucy dead less than a fortnight,
Mina's health hanging in the balance.

01:09:58.711 --> 01:10:01.043
The ball's been in progress
for over an hour.

01:10:01.113 --> 01:10:03.604
It appears as if Count Dracula
isn't coming.

01:10:03.749 --> 01:10:05.979
I hope you're wrong, my boy.

01:10:06.051 --> 01:10:09.248
I especially wanted to see
Count Dracula tonight.

01:10:09.321 --> 01:10:11.380
I wonder if he suspects something.

01:10:11.457 --> 01:10:12.947
Good evening.

01:10:13.425 --> 01:10:16.394
- Did I startle you?
- No!

01:10:19.565 --> 01:10:22.898
- May I take your cape, sir?
- No, not my cape.

01:10:23.035 --> 01:10:24.900
You may take my hat.

01:10:27.773 --> 01:10:29.138
Thank you.

01:10:32.211 --> 01:10:34.509
We were afraid you wouldn't show up.

01:10:35.514 --> 01:10:37.948
I would not miss your gala.

01:10:38.017 --> 01:10:41.748
I always keep my nights open
for new experiences.

01:10:45.658 --> 01:10:46.989
Miss Mina.

01:10:47.059 --> 01:10:49.584
She looks especially lovely tonight.

01:10:49.762 --> 01:10:53.664
Would you be insanely jealous
if I should ask her to dance?

01:10:54.300 --> 01:10:57.269
Well, to be perfectly frank... Not at all.

01:10:57.736 --> 01:10:59.101
Thank you.

01:11:03.575 --> 01:11:04.803
Master!

01:11:05.144 --> 01:11:06.270
You're here.

01:11:08.247 --> 01:11:10.181
Do not call me master.

01:11:11.617 --> 01:11:15.212
- What are you doing here?
- I don't know. They invited me.

01:11:15.421 --> 01:11:16.979
I smell a rat.

01:11:17.589 --> 01:11:19.921
- Where?
- Renfield.

01:11:21.727 --> 01:11:24.628
If I am discovered, we must flee.

01:11:24.697 --> 01:11:27.097
Yes. I'll escape. I'll meet you at Carfax.

01:11:27.166 --> 01:11:31.125
No. That would be too dangerous.
They will search there first.

01:11:32.237 --> 01:11:35.331
I have moved my coffin
to the abandoned chapel...

01:11:35.407 --> 01:11:37.204
at the top of the cliffs.

01:11:37.710 --> 01:11:40.008
When you come,
make sure you're not being followed.

01:11:40.079 --> 01:11:41.740
- Do you understand?
- Yes, master.

01:11:41.814 --> 01:11:43.805
- Do not call me master.
- Yes...

01:11:58.597 --> 01:12:00.758
Good evening, Miss Mina.

01:12:00.933 --> 01:12:04.892
- May I have the next dance?
- I beg your pardon, sir.

01:12:04.970 --> 01:12:07.063
Can't you see
I'm having a drink with Miss Mina?

01:12:07.139 --> 01:12:09.369
You have finished your drink.

01:12:12.511 --> 01:12:14.069
So I have.

01:12:14.646 --> 01:12:16.238
Come, Miss Mina.

01:12:31.797 --> 01:12:33.628
- Martin.
- Right.

01:12:43.008 --> 01:12:44.066
Now!

01:12:51.483 --> 01:12:54.884
I can't see him. How can this be?

01:12:55.421 --> 01:12:57.013
The vampire...

01:12:57.089 --> 01:13:00.217
casts no reflection in a mirror.

01:13:10.769 --> 01:13:13.761
She's doing quite well
without him, isn't she?

01:13:19.378 --> 01:13:21.505
Hey, we must be good.

01:13:22.014 --> 01:13:24.710
Let's really give them something to watch.

01:13:24.783 --> 01:13:26.842
Play the czardas.

01:13:27.319 --> 01:13:29.014
Czardas.

01:13:56.915 --> 01:13:58.576
They're loving it.

01:14:06.225 --> 01:14:07.419
Come on!

01:14:07.826 --> 01:14:09.589
Big finish.

01:14:53.038 --> 01:14:57.099
You are a very wise man, Van Helsing...

01:14:57.743 --> 01:15:01.770
for someone who has yet to live
a single lifetime.

01:15:20.899 --> 01:15:22.127
Get him!

01:15:27.906 --> 01:15:29.430
Master!

01:15:30.576 --> 01:15:32.373
I mean, mister!

01:15:34.046 --> 01:15:35.104
You!

01:15:35.681 --> 01:15:37.410
Where do you think you're going?

01:15:37.482 --> 01:15:38.779
Professor!

01:15:39.985 --> 01:15:43.716
- We must find him before sunrise.
- Why before sunrise?

01:15:43.789 --> 01:15:46.257
Because the rays of the sun
will destroy him.

01:15:46.325 --> 01:15:48.555
He must hide during the daylight hours.

01:15:48.694 --> 01:15:51.322
Come, or Miss Mina
will be lost to us forever.

01:15:52.164 --> 01:15:54.291
Come along, old fly-eater.

01:15:55.901 --> 01:15:59.359
We've searched Carfax Abbey from top
to bottom. There's no trace of them.

01:15:59.438 --> 01:16:01.531
What can we do, Professor?
Where could he be?

01:16:01.607 --> 01:16:03.074
I don't know.

01:16:05.510 --> 01:16:08.968
We must release Renfield.
He is our only hope.

01:16:09.281 --> 01:16:11.374
He called Dracula "master."

01:16:11.583 --> 01:16:13.710
I thought he said, "mister."

01:16:14.386 --> 01:16:17.913
That was only a ruse
to fool the feebleminded.

01:16:18.223 --> 01:16:19.918
- No offense.
- I understand.

01:16:19.992 --> 01:16:22.256
Renfield will go straight to Dracula.

01:16:23.061 --> 01:16:25.256
And we will follow. This way.

01:16:31.069 --> 01:16:33.003
You'll stay here till you rot.

01:16:37.976 --> 01:16:39.671
Well, you're free to go.

01:16:39.878 --> 01:16:43.541
- Free to go? Why? How?
- Good behavior.

01:16:43.749 --> 01:16:46.013
But I've only been in here for a moment.

01:16:46.084 --> 01:16:49.713
Well, for that moment,
your behavior was very good.

01:16:50.789 --> 01:16:52.017
Let's go.

01:16:54.993 --> 01:16:56.620
Watch your step.

01:16:57.963 --> 01:16:59.726
I'm coming, master.

01:17:01.900 --> 01:17:05.666
I know what they are up to.
They think I'll lead them to the master.

01:17:05.737 --> 01:17:07.534
I must outsmart them.

01:17:20.352 --> 01:17:21.649
Lost them.

01:17:25.257 --> 01:17:27.248
Gentlemen, we are fortunate.

01:17:27.326 --> 01:17:29.726
- Why?
- He's an imbecile. Come.

01:17:56.621 --> 01:17:58.384
Master, I'm here.

01:18:01.993 --> 01:18:03.654
Are you sure you were not followed?

01:18:03.729 --> 01:18:05.720
No, I led them in the wrong direction.

01:18:05.797 --> 01:18:07.662
They have no idea where I am.

01:18:07.733 --> 01:18:09.598
He went into the chapel. Hurry!

01:18:09.668 --> 01:18:12.728
You have led them right to me,
you stupid nuncompoop.

01:18:12.804 --> 01:18:16.262
I didn't know.
I'm sorry, master. Punish me.

01:18:16.408 --> 01:18:19.138
No. Go. Lead them away.
I don't have any time.

01:18:19.211 --> 01:18:21.679
No, you must punish me.
Hurt me. I deserve it.

01:18:21.747 --> 01:18:25.274
- Not now!
- But I've failed you, master!

01:18:25.350 --> 01:18:29.150
I'm a useless, pitiful fool
who has betrayed you.

01:18:29.221 --> 01:18:30.882
You must hurt me.

01:18:31.423 --> 01:18:32.981
All right!

01:18:34.993 --> 01:18:37.826
Good, master. Good.

01:18:40.799 --> 01:18:43.165
Okay, that's enough.

01:18:50.709 --> 01:18:51.835
Why?

01:18:55.313 --> 01:18:56.337
Up there!

01:19:07.025 --> 01:19:08.458
It's locked.

01:19:09.094 --> 01:19:10.721
Break it open.

01:19:10.796 --> 01:19:12.855
- Put your weight into it.
- Doctor.

01:19:12.931 --> 01:19:14.228
Okay.

01:19:23.475 --> 01:19:25.136
They are too late.

01:19:25.811 --> 01:19:29.804
Soon you will be my bride for eternity.

01:19:30.682 --> 01:19:32.274
Don't stop.

01:19:33.118 --> 01:19:34.642
Good, keep it up.

01:19:34.719 --> 01:19:35.947
Harder.

01:19:39.758 --> 01:19:41.692
The hinges are giving way.

01:20:01.780 --> 01:20:03.077
Jonathan, duck.

01:20:14.059 --> 01:20:15.219
Back.

01:20:15.293 --> 01:20:17.124
Jonathan, get that stake.

01:20:17.229 --> 01:20:19.754
A sharp wooden stick, anything.

01:20:20.232 --> 01:20:21.494
Back.

01:20:22.434 --> 01:20:23.628
Good.

01:20:24.669 --> 01:20:27.365
Now drive it through his heart.

01:20:31.142 --> 01:20:32.439
Look out!

01:20:50.462 --> 01:20:53.124
Arrogant mortal.

01:20:53.665 --> 01:20:56.657
You are in my world now...

01:20:56.735 --> 01:20:59.966
and you will never leave this attic alive.

01:21:00.205 --> 01:21:03.402
I will destroy you...

01:21:03.808 --> 01:21:07.437
and then I will possess she
whom you love the most...

01:21:07.512 --> 01:21:12.142
and there is not a single thing
in the world you can do to stop me.

01:21:20.191 --> 01:21:22.284
For that you'll watch...

01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:26.888
while with your beloved Mina
I consummate our marriage.

01:22:04.869 --> 01:22:06.928
Grab him. He's getting away.

01:22:07.005 --> 01:22:08.165
Grab him.

01:22:14.679 --> 01:22:17.648
- Where is he? Where did he go?
- He's up there.

01:22:18.316 --> 01:22:21.774
We must catch him, or else all is lost.

01:22:26.291 --> 01:22:27.588
Master.

01:22:27.759 --> 01:22:29.021
This way.

01:22:31.997 --> 01:22:34.465
Renfield, you asshole!

01:22:44.976 --> 01:22:46.500
Where am I?

01:22:46.678 --> 01:22:48.805
- What's happened to Dracula?
- He's dead.

01:22:49.114 --> 01:22:50.843
And you're free.

01:22:51.383 --> 01:22:52.850
Thank God.

01:22:52.951 --> 01:22:56.352
You're my own sweet,
innocent Mina again.

01:22:58.323 --> 01:23:02.760
And I have you, my darling Jonathan,
to thank for it.

01:23:05.263 --> 01:23:07.060
And now, my dearest...

01:23:08.533 --> 01:23:10.296
let me take you home.

01:23:23.281 --> 01:23:24.475
Master!

01:23:27.719 --> 01:23:29.380
I'm sorry.

01:23:30.622 --> 01:23:32.112
Forgive me.

01:23:41.900 --> 01:23:43.060
There.

01:23:43.501 --> 01:23:46.902
You're starting to look like
your old self again.

01:23:53.278 --> 01:23:56.042
Your master is gone forever, Mr. Renfield.

01:23:56.314 --> 01:23:58.305
You are your own man now.

01:23:59.317 --> 01:24:00.682
- I am?
- Yes.

01:24:00.919 --> 01:24:03.251
No one will ever control you again.

01:24:03.321 --> 01:24:05.221
- You're right.
- Good.

01:24:06.091 --> 01:24:08.286
- Come, Renfield.
- Yes, master.
