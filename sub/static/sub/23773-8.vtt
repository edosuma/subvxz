01:06.320 --> 01:08.320
FILM 8

01:08.400 --> 01:12.320
<i>Misguided loyalty looks for one thing.</i>

01:13.040 --> 01:14.560
<i>Destruction.</i>

01:20.640 --> 01:23.000
DO NOT DISTURB

01:46.920 --> 01:48.880
You’re on sick leave.

01:48.960 --> 01:50.440
I was discharged.

01:51.280 --> 01:52.680
I’m on vacation.

01:54.520 --> 01:58.400
Does your papa know
where you’re spending your vacation?

01:59.000 --> 02:00.880
I don’t report to my father.

02:07.720 --> 02:10.199
You’re right, about the gun.

02:11.920 --> 02:13.760
I wasn’t prepared.

02:18.240 --> 02:20.280
When I was lying there in the trunk--

02:21.280 --> 02:24.440
with my hands tied, choking--
I made myself a promise.

02:25.360 --> 02:29.000
If I get out of this,
I won’t let it happen again.

02:29.840 --> 02:31.040
Ever again.

02:33.680 --> 02:35.000
Teach me.

02:37.080 --> 02:38.440
What?

02:39.120 --> 02:40.800
How not to be a victim.

02:44.680 --> 02:45.480
Come here.

02:47.520 --> 02:48.640
Come, come.

02:50.160 --> 02:51.160
Come here.

02:53.280 --> 02:54.480
Come on.

02:57.040 --> 02:58.080
Go on.

03:05.520 --> 03:07.600
You wanted lessons. Here’s your first:

03:08.440 --> 03:10.160
Always expect an attack.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.680
-Do you understand?
-Yes!

03:19.960 --> 03:22.720
The second: Don’t wait for them to return.

03:24.520 --> 03:26.200
Striking from behind is an advantage.

03:28.480 --> 03:31.320
Third: Never attack without a weapon.

03:31.920 --> 03:33.840
-You’re against weapons!
-You don’t listen well.

03:35.360 --> 03:38.560
I’m against the handgun.
It’s your enemy, not your ally.

03:38.640 --> 03:41.160
You worry about it,
but it doesn’t worry about you. Got it?

03:41.720 --> 03:43.000
I got it!

03:44.640 --> 03:46.400
Use what you have on hand.

03:57.200 --> 03:58.480
You get it.

04:09.920 --> 04:11.520
<i>Do you feel it?</i>

04:12.960 --> 04:14.280
<i>I love you.</i>

04:30.520 --> 04:33.120
Do you know what mole syndrome is?

04:34.040 --> 04:36.520
I took a course in strategic psychology.

04:38.800 --> 04:40.720
Mole syndrome

04:40.800 --> 04:45.040
is the danger of a double agent
losing his frame of reference.

04:45.760 --> 04:47.960
It’s based on a paradox.

04:48.040 --> 04:52.360
In order to work effectively undercover,
you have to adopt your enemy’s values.

04:53.000 --> 04:58.240
The danger is that those values
may replace the agent’s own,

04:58.320 --> 05:01.320
so you need to know
how to not cross the line.

05:07.280 --> 05:11.880
And you don’t think that, at some point,
you crossed the line?

05:23.640 --> 05:28.480
NIZHNY NOVGOROD

05:42.720 --> 05:44.200
The ninth one already.

05:44.280 --> 05:46.200
The whole city is going crazy.

05:46.280 --> 05:48.800
The girls are young, lovely.

05:49.320 --> 05:52.760
The examiner says that she wasn’t stabbed
with a knife, but some pointed tool.

05:53.520 --> 05:57.800
Who do you have to be to do that?
Thirty stab wounds.

06:05.480 --> 06:06.800
Thirty-seven.

06:20.520 --> 06:21.760
Screwdriver.

06:22.520 --> 06:23.720
What are you writing?

06:24.480 --> 06:26.240
Her arms are folded, like for a funeral.

06:26.320 --> 06:28.400
Posing victims like that
signifies remorse.

06:28.480 --> 06:30.640
-I learned that in criminology.
-There’s no remorse.

06:30.720 --> 06:33.840
This is part of his memory,
something very personal.

06:34.440 --> 06:35.880
Pick a bouquet of flowers.

06:36.920 --> 06:38.040
Pick a bouquet.

06:38.120 --> 06:40.760
Animal.
How can these people walk the earth?

06:41.880 --> 06:44.720
He’s not an animal.
He’s Nikolaich, your neighbor.

06:44.800 --> 06:48.400
What neighbor?
I don’t have a neighbor named Nikolaich.

06:48.480 --> 06:50.480
Well, did you pick the bouquet?

06:51.280 --> 06:54.080
Who do you play checkers with?
Who do you have a beer with?

06:54.160 --> 06:55.360
Petrovich? Ionich?

06:57.080 --> 06:58.400
Excuse me, my dear.

06:59.560 --> 07:00.760
Come here. What do you see?

07:24.560 --> 07:26.240
Mine are long, and hers…

07:26.320 --> 07:27.920
This is how women pick flowers.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.840
Then you prune them to fit the vase.
They’re all one length.

07:30.920 --> 07:34.160
And this is what his hands did.
Now that’s interesting.

07:35.240 --> 07:37.840
So you mean to say
he was picking flowers with her?

07:51.560 --> 07:53.560
MOSS HILLS STATION

07:55.080 --> 07:57.960
All the victims
studied or worked in Nizhny.

07:58.360 --> 08:01.200
They all took the train.

08:01.280 --> 08:03.040
They got off, and that’s it.

08:03.120 --> 08:06.760
A local saw the next-to-last victim
get into a car.

08:06.840 --> 08:09.400
The car was blue.

08:09.480 --> 08:11.280
The driver was…

08:11.360 --> 08:13.040
-What?
-Well, like so.

08:13.120 --> 08:14.600
Wearing pants.

08:14.680 --> 08:15.880
Don’t talk like that.

08:16.360 --> 08:18.200
We checked all the gypsy cabs.

08:18.760 --> 08:20.160
It’s like this with us.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.440
Half the town works in Novgorod.

08:23.520 --> 08:25.200
They come back here to sleep.

08:25.600 --> 08:28.720
The station is five miles from the city.

08:29.600 --> 08:31.200
Buses rarely come.

08:31.280 --> 08:34.000
Gypsy cabs will take you for 50 rubles.

08:34.520 --> 08:37.720
I’ve talked with everyone.
I even banned the gypsy cabs.

08:37.799 --> 08:39.799
The people are starting to get aggravated.

08:39.880 --> 08:43.320
Then I sent for some girls
from the police academy.

08:43.400 --> 08:44.960
They dressed up like students

08:45.560 --> 08:49.240
and got on the train
three stations away from us.

08:49.320 --> 08:51.560
-For three months and--
-He didn’t bite?

08:51.640 --> 08:52.640
No.

08:53.080 --> 08:56.360
And we’re just… burying girls.

08:57.080 --> 08:58.480
I said he’s an animal!

08:58.560 --> 09:01.560
Take a closer look
at your neighbor what’s-his-name.

09:01.640 --> 09:03.240
Can you get him drunk?

09:03.320 --> 09:05.800
What a sober person has on his mind,
a drunk locks in his trunk.

09:05.880 --> 09:07.600
Are you still putting the bunnies
out there?

09:07.680 --> 09:09.480
-Who?
-The girls on the train.

09:10.240 --> 09:11.640
In vain.

09:12.480 --> 09:14.320
You’re our only hope.

09:14.400 --> 09:16.720
-Why didn’t he bite?
-He saw the fisherman.

09:17.320 --> 09:18.520
There you go.

09:27.240 --> 09:29.320
Papa! Pop!

09:31.520 --> 09:32.840
Why are you sleeping so long?

09:33.520 --> 09:34.360
Good morning!

09:37.360 --> 09:38.560
Exactly.

09:38.960 --> 09:40.280
Make us some coffee. Pop!

09:48.160 --> 09:50.080
Will you buy me a ring?

09:50.160 --> 09:52.160
Mom has a lot.

09:52.240 --> 09:54.720
And a lot of necklaces. I don’t have any!

09:59.400 --> 10:00.520
Yes, of course…

10:00.600 --> 10:04.080
But, my daughter,
I’m not a billionaire like Abramovich,

10:04.160 --> 10:06.080
just a plain cab driver
called Andriyevich.

10:06.160 --> 10:08.560
But I’ll buy you one, of course.
Absolutely.

10:08.640 --> 10:10.040
Of course I’ll buy you one.

10:12.760 --> 10:14.760
MOSS HILLS

10:35.080 --> 10:37.000
How much to take me to Blukher?

10:37.920 --> 10:40.160
I’m not going anywhere right now.
I’m waiting on a client.

10:41.760 --> 10:44.640
-Can you drop me along the way?
-Are you deaf? Get out of here!

10:45.320 --> 10:47.440
-You jackass!
-Go on, go on.

10:56.080 --> 10:57.760
Young lady, did you have an accident?

10:58.840 --> 11:01.520
Your eyes are sparkling.
When is the wedding?

11:02.680 --> 11:04.680
-In two weeks.
-Let me help you. Are you… Thank you.

11:07.720 --> 11:09.400
-…psychic?
-No.

11:09.480 --> 11:11.840
I’ll let you in on a terrible secret.
I’m not a psychic.

11:11.920 --> 11:13.240
I’m a cab driver.

11:13.880 --> 11:16.080
So why is that a secret?

11:16.160 --> 11:19.240
Because of the killer.
They’re chasing the cabbies out of town.

11:19.320 --> 11:21.000
You can’t give any rides. It’s prohibited

11:21.080 --> 11:24.040
If that lowlife had caught you,
he’d strangle you with his bare hands.

11:25.120 --> 11:27.520
How much to Kirov, the corner of Chkalov?

11:27.600 --> 11:29.320
My car’s only worth a kopeck.

11:29.840 --> 11:31.680
So I’ll take you for a kopeck.

11:33.160 --> 11:34.560
But seriously?

11:34.640 --> 11:38.800
Well, of course, I need the money.
But I won’t take more than 50 rubles.

11:39.480 --> 11:42.040
And save your feet!
You have to dance at your wedding!

11:42.120 --> 11:43.680
-Get in.
-Thank you.

11:46.120 --> 11:47.520
This is for you.

11:48.800 --> 11:51.160
It’s a joke.
It’s for my wife, for her birthday.

12:56.320 --> 12:57.760
We checked her purse.

12:58.600 --> 13:00.440
No ID. Just a phone.

13:01.200 --> 13:04.080
We called the last number dialed.
Looks like her boyfriend.

13:05.760 --> 13:07.720
We asked him to identify the body.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.280
Let me go!

13:13.360 --> 13:14.600
A friend of yours?

13:17.160 --> 13:17.960
My fiancée.

13:21.880 --> 13:23.520
Your fiancée? Did you love her?

13:24.320 --> 13:27.120
If you loved her,
calm down and look carefully.

13:27.200 --> 13:29.880
If you see anything unusual,
you’ll help us catch this bastard.

13:29.960 --> 13:31.120
Let him go. Look.

13:32.360 --> 13:34.200
No, I can’t.

13:34.280 --> 13:36.240
-Look.
-Don’t you understand?

13:37.560 --> 13:39.040
Look, look, look.

13:39.560 --> 13:40.760
What do you see?

13:50.800 --> 13:52.160
Her ring is gone.

13:52.240 --> 13:53.520
What’d you say?

13:53.600 --> 13:55.040
Her ring is gone.

13:56.080 --> 13:58.560
I gave her a ring.
Our wedding is in two weeks.

13:58.640 --> 14:01.000
-What kind of ring is it?
-Silver.

14:02.400 --> 14:05.680
Good job. We’re going. Come.

14:07.680 --> 14:08.920
The ring is missing.

14:11.480 --> 14:13.960
He takes their things,
rapes them, then kills them.

14:14.040 --> 14:15.400
What’s most important to him?

14:15.920 --> 14:18.120
Combining business with pleasure.

14:19.800 --> 14:21.440
But mainly pleasure.

14:30.920 --> 14:32.280
We caught the creep.

14:36.200 --> 14:37.280
What?

14:37.880 --> 14:41.360
We detained him at the train station.
No documents, dirty, covered in blood.

14:41.440 --> 14:43.800
We interrogated him,
and he admitted to it.

14:43.880 --> 14:45.320
Did he admit to all the murders?

14:45.400 --> 14:47.160
No, just the one. Here.

14:52.720 --> 14:54.320
As a matter a fact, it’s him.

14:57.200 --> 14:59.480
Repeat what you told me!

15:05.600 --> 15:06.880
-Wow!
-There you have it.

15:06.960 --> 15:08.640
It looks like your killer is blind.

15:08.720 --> 15:11.440
Is he a rare type?
Did he sniff out the victim with his nose?

15:11.520 --> 15:12.840
What do you mean blind?

15:13.720 --> 15:15.280
How did he confess?

15:15.360 --> 15:16.960
Did you hit him or something?

15:17.040 --> 15:19.560
I hit him once, well, for good measure!

15:19.640 --> 15:22.040
He’ll confess to everything.
Why don’t you ask him?

15:23.520 --> 15:26.200
Interrogation is a joy. Yeah?

15:26.280 --> 15:27.400
-What’s your name?
-Mikhail.

15:27.480 --> 15:29.880
Mikhail, go out into the hall.
They’re waiting for you.

15:29.960 --> 15:31.480
Whose move?

15:31.560 --> 15:32.840
Misha’s.

15:32.920 --> 15:34.080
I’ll play for him.

15:34.160 --> 15:35.920
-Well, did you kill her?
-Yes.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.160
-With an ax?
-Yes.

15:38.240 --> 15:39.640
-Cut her into pieces?
-Yes.

15:39.720 --> 15:41.360
-Did you like it?
-Yes.

15:41.440 --> 15:43.040
Excellent, you get a cookie.

15:43.120 --> 15:46.480
What cookie? He identified the location,
described everything in detail.

15:46.560 --> 15:49.160
-His hands are bloody!
-He found the victim. He wanted to help.

15:49.680 --> 15:51.240
He needs to go to the hospital.

15:52.040 --> 15:54.040
You ought to, as well, but you’re healthy.

15:54.560 --> 15:56.800
-They don’t take healthy people, do they?
-What?

16:00.040 --> 16:02.120
Why are you standing there? Help him!

16:02.200 --> 16:04.640
You’re quick to take him.
Maybe he’ll still see.

16:06.200 --> 16:07.640
Major, shall we finish?

17:07.319 --> 17:09.040
Help me!

17:32.280 --> 17:34.000
Who do you see there?

17:35.200 --> 17:38.640
Come on! Hurry! What’s there?

17:38.840 --> 17:43.680
MUNICIPAL HOSPITAL No. 5

17:52.640 --> 17:54.160
Four holes in her lungs.

17:54.240 --> 17:55.600
Go on. Later, later.

17:56.040 --> 17:57.920
I don’t understand how she survived.

17:59.320 --> 18:00.800
You have two minutes.

18:04.280 --> 18:05.920
Look at this, please.

18:12.160 --> 18:13.480
Hello, my dear.

18:14.440 --> 18:17.400
If you want to say “yes,” squeeze my hand.

18:17.480 --> 18:20.840
Just don’t break it.
You’re very strong. Understand?

18:24.000 --> 18:26.560
Excellent. Tell me, please.

18:26.640 --> 18:29.080
They found blood on your lips.

18:29.160 --> 18:31.840
And your lips and teeth are whole.

18:32.360 --> 18:34.920
I know I’m right to assume you’re smart.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.640
You bit him, right?

18:38.600 --> 18:39.840
Good job!

18:43.120 --> 18:44.920
I didn’t get that. Say it again.

18:46.520 --> 18:48.080
Flowers.

18:48.840 --> 18:50.800
Flowers. What about flowers?

18:53.760 --> 18:54.760
…flowers.

18:54.840 --> 18:56.760
I don’t understand. One more time.

18:56.840 --> 18:59.240
-In the car.
-There are flowers in his car?

19:01.480 --> 19:02.440
Excellent!

19:02.520 --> 19:06.320
My clever girl, I promise you,
before they fix you up here,

19:06.400 --> 19:08.120
I’ll show him to you.

19:08.200 --> 19:09.080
Agreed?

19:10.120 --> 19:12.960
Don’t you worry.
And don’t go dancing without me.

19:13.040 --> 19:13.760
All right?

19:14.560 --> 19:17.040
That’s all. Rest. Get better.

19:20.600 --> 19:21.600
Let’s go.

19:43.280 --> 19:44.360
Look.

19:57.240 --> 20:01.240
You’re finished. We’re already here.
We know everything. You have a wife, kids.

20:18.680 --> 20:21.320
What’ll happen to them?
We can catch you any second.

20:21.400 --> 20:23.720
Keep watch. Those two. That’s us.

21:05.360 --> 21:07.160
I can’t understand.

21:08.040 --> 21:10.120
-What?
-There’s a killer in town.

21:11.320 --> 21:14.920
Everyone knows this,
yet they still get in his car.

21:21.720 --> 21:24.480
Well, everyone has their own method.

21:28.240 --> 21:29.440
See you tomorrow.

22:45.400 --> 22:46.920
What’s wrong?

22:47.000 --> 22:48.440
Something’s wrong with me.

22:48.520 --> 22:49.840
And what’s wrong with your hand?

22:49.920 --> 22:51.320
It’s nothing.

22:52.680 --> 22:54.280
You need to go to the doctor.

22:54.360 --> 22:56.160
No, I need some peppered vodka.

23:42.640 --> 23:46.520
Hello, Zhorik! I thought for a long time
and couldn’t decide how to tell you.

23:46.600 --> 23:48.600
I found someone else.
We’re getting married soon.

24:29.360 --> 24:30.720
Because of that chick?

24:31.800 --> 24:34.760
Girls like her need to hang themselves.

24:34.840 --> 24:35.840
Correct him.

25:43.760 --> 25:44.960
Zhor.

25:45.960 --> 25:47.600
Let’s go to sleep.

25:50.120 --> 25:52.320
I’ll sit here a bit longer
and then come in.

25:53.400 --> 25:54.960
Did you like the ring?

25:59.920 --> 26:01.320
It’s pretty.

26:02.080 --> 26:05.320
Only it’s a little worn.
What’d you do, buy it off someone’s hand?

26:05.920 --> 26:08.600
Polish it, and it’ll be like new.

26:19.680 --> 26:23.400
MOSCOW

26:32.720 --> 26:36.360
Semyon Arkadyevich, Alexander Tikhonov,
Investigative Committee.

26:36.440 --> 26:37.840
I can’t find you.

26:39.640 --> 26:41.200
Yes, I see.

26:43.600 --> 26:45.600
WATCH REPAIR - OPEN

26:47.560 --> 26:48.760
Hello.

26:53.480 --> 26:55.000
Volodya gave this to me.

26:55.600 --> 26:59.040
Imagine what kind of talent this guy had.

26:59.800 --> 27:01.640
He didn’t have any patterns.

27:02.920 --> 27:04.120
Nothing.

27:05.120 --> 27:07.240
He saw the picture in a magazine

27:07.320 --> 27:08.720
and did it from the picture.

27:09.880 --> 27:11.640
Golden hands indeed.

27:12.640 --> 27:14.040
Yes, golden.

27:15.400 --> 27:17.000
Semyon Arkadyevich, tell me.

27:17.080 --> 27:22.360
You said on the phone
that you often visited Vladimir, right?

27:22.800 --> 27:24.440
What do you call “often”?

27:24.520 --> 27:26.200
He was completely alone.

27:27.400 --> 27:28.800
Even when he was married.

27:29.800 --> 27:31.520
He was obsessed with her.

27:33.040 --> 27:34.480
And when she left…

27:36.000 --> 27:39.520
I started to feel sorry for him.
I thought he’d hurt himself.

27:40.280 --> 27:42.880
We crossed paths in our modeling club.

27:44.840 --> 27:46.920
And then I started visiting him.

27:47.360 --> 27:50.640
To chat, to support him.

28:02.120 --> 28:05.560
Tell me.
Besides you, did anyone come to see him?

28:06.160 --> 28:08.880
Well, no. Only some guy.

28:09.640 --> 28:11.160
So, what guy?

28:12.360 --> 28:16.080
I didn’t understand myself whether
he was a disciple or a prophet.

28:16.680 --> 28:17.440
A prophet?

28:17.520 --> 28:19.720
They sat and talked for hours.

28:20.920 --> 28:23.200
I said,
“Volodya, what are you talking about?”

28:25.040 --> 28:27.040
And he said, “Life.”

28:27.480 --> 28:30.680
Well, what’s it to me
if took his mind off things?

28:32.200 --> 28:34.880
It’s better to be in a cult than a noose.

28:34.960 --> 28:38.360
Yes, I agree.
Do you remember what he looked like?

28:38.440 --> 28:40.440
Yeah, like you.

28:41.640 --> 28:44.160
Same height, same age.

28:46.760 --> 28:51.240
Could we come by in a few days
and have you sit with a sketch artist?

28:52.480 --> 28:54.960
-If you must.
-Excellent. Thank you.

28:55.720 --> 28:56.800
Good-bye!

28:56.880 --> 28:58.360
Good-bye.

29:04.040 --> 29:05.040
FLOWERS

29:05.120 --> 29:07.080
What kind of bouquet do you want, sir?

29:07.520 --> 29:09.280
Does your daughter
have some kind of event?

29:09.360 --> 29:12.480
An event for her?
Yeah. Every day with me, right?

29:12.560 --> 29:14.120
That doesn’t even describe it, my dear.

29:14.200 --> 29:16.000
-It was for murder.
-What?

29:16.080 --> 29:17.680
You served time for murder?

29:18.320 --> 29:20.440
What is this, a joke?

29:20.520 --> 29:22.160
Murder isn’t a joke.

29:22.640 --> 29:25.040
You know what the situation is here.

29:25.120 --> 29:26.880
Girls are being killed left and right.

29:26.960 --> 29:29.720
How did you slip under the radar?
I can’t wrap my head around it.

29:34.320 --> 29:37.680
A normal man is plagued by boredom.
Our kind by despair.

29:38.440 --> 29:42.240
Those who have killed already,
who have tried it, are beyond despair.

29:42.320 --> 29:47.840
A gray, thick blanket covers them,
because they’re cold.

29:49.000 --> 29:50.000
For you.

29:51.640 --> 29:52.840
Thanks.

29:53.440 --> 29:55.760
You need to pay for it. Let’s talk.

30:02.040 --> 30:04.040
I served my tenner.

30:04.120 --> 30:05.400
I was young.

30:05.480 --> 30:07.240
I was drunk and stabbed my wife.

30:07.880 --> 30:09.200
Jealousy.

30:10.560 --> 30:14.200
I came back.
Every week, I bring flowers to her grave.

30:14.280 --> 30:16.760
-Buying your way out of it?
-Buying my way out.

30:17.600 --> 30:19.160
And I remind myself.

30:19.240 --> 30:22.920
I’d sooner hurt myself
than lay my hands on someone else.

30:23.000 --> 30:24.400
Never again.

30:25.000 --> 30:26.720
Twenty years on the straight and narrow.

30:26.800 --> 30:28.800
You’re a rare person, Arsen.

30:29.920 --> 30:33.920
Even for a wife who’s still alive to get
such treatment-- flowers every week--

30:34.000 --> 30:35.400
you hardly ever see that.

30:35.480 --> 30:38.960
-And you do this for your dead wife.
-Arsen, do you have any regular customers?

30:39.040 --> 30:42.000
Someone who buys flowers
once a week or more.

30:42.080 --> 30:44.480
No. No buyers.

30:45.040 --> 30:48.720
The cabbie that gives me a ride
takes the remainders to his wife.

30:48.800 --> 30:52.320
Every day, he takes me to and from work,
and my merchandise.

30:52.400 --> 30:54.080
I don’t have a car.

30:54.600 --> 30:56.840
And I give him a bouquet for that.

30:57.640 --> 30:59.600
His wife lucked out. You’re a romantic, Zhora.

31:10.200 --> 31:11.400
Zhora.

31:12.560 --> 31:14.480
Do you know who the killer is?

31:14.560 --> 31:17.120
You asked why they would get in his car.

31:17.760 --> 31:21.160
He has flowers, you clever girl.
Flowers in his front seat.

31:22.200 --> 31:24.040
“Get in. I’ll tidy that up.

31:24.120 --> 31:26.840
I buy flowers for my wife every day.

31:27.360 --> 31:30.680
Fifteen years of marriage
and I still love her. Can you blame me?”

31:31.560 --> 31:34.240
-How could you not ride with him?
-How’d you learn his name?

31:34.760 --> 31:36.400
Glukhoi ran some lists.

31:36.480 --> 31:40.880
Which of the locals prowls the streets
boldly and more often than the others?

31:42.520 --> 31:45.320
Glukhoi found out who had a blue car.

31:46.240 --> 31:49.800
Georgy Andriyevich-- a good guy, a cabbie.

31:49.880 --> 31:53.120
-Wife, daughter-- cute as a button.
-And why didn’t you tell me?

31:53.600 --> 31:55.320
Why are you making a fool out of me?

31:57.840 --> 31:59.440
I’m telling you now.

32:01.400 --> 32:03.360
So now we can bring him in?

32:06.080 --> 32:07.200
How?

32:09.400 --> 32:11.280
He doesn’t leave evidence.

32:11.360 --> 32:13.560
It’s unlikely we’ll find something.

32:14.400 --> 32:17.160
With a good lawyer,
he’ll be out in three days.

33:06.600 --> 33:08.240
Been getting a tan?

33:09.000 --> 33:10.720
Yeah. There are no buses.

33:10.800 --> 33:12.240
Where are we going?

33:13.000 --> 33:15.280
-To the city.
-Let me take you.

33:15.360 --> 33:16.200
Get in.

33:23.200 --> 33:25.400
-Give me your bags.
-There you go.

33:54.920 --> 33:55.840
You have a wife.

33:59.480 --> 34:02.680
Look how beautiful it is!
What an amazing field!

34:02.760 --> 34:07.200
You live here your whole life and don’t
know there’s such a beautiful field here.

34:08.400 --> 34:09.239
Let’s stop.

34:10.560 --> 34:14.440
Look. Get out. See how beautiful it is?

34:14.520 --> 34:15.639
Look.

34:15.719 --> 34:17.440
Flowers. Look.

34:17.520 --> 34:18.560
Well?

34:19.000 --> 34:22.159
Your whole life, you don’t notice. Look!

34:22.239 --> 34:24.400
Look how pretty it is!

34:24.480 --> 34:25.639
Well? Look!

35:44.600 --> 35:46.960
-Kill him!
-You don’t understand.

35:47.040 --> 35:49.640
I do that when there’s no way out
or no road back.

35:50.240 --> 35:51.560
Who’s he going to hurt now?

35:51.640 --> 35:54.720
They were 17, 19, 20--
all younger than me.

35:54.800 --> 35:56.440
Kill him and I’ll buy you a cactus!

35:56.520 --> 35:58.360
I’m begging you. You’re not animals. How do you know if we’re animals or not?

36:00.360 --> 36:01.800
-Get in.
-I have a daughter!

36:01.880 --> 36:04.520
-You don’t have to!
-You don’t have one anymore.

36:04.600 --> 36:05.800
Kill him.

36:38.600 --> 36:41.280
Help me, someone. Help me.

36:41.360 --> 36:43.880
-Keep walking.
-Help me, please.

36:43.960 --> 36:46.640
Help me. God, it’s so painful.

36:46.720 --> 36:48.600
-What happened?
-We came to visit a patient.

36:48.680 --> 36:49.840
-Help me.
-Here. -Don’t kill me.
-Come on.

36:51.160 --> 36:53.440
-Don’t kill me.
-Quiet.

36:57.920 --> 36:59.080
Hello, my dear.

36:59.680 --> 37:01.560
I promised you. Here he is.

37:16.920 --> 37:19.440
-Help the man.
-I can’t see anything.

37:19.520 --> 37:22.720
-You can listen to local radio.
-I don’t see anything.

37:27.080 --> 37:28.480
<i>This is the deal.</i>

37:28.560 --> 37:31.080
<i>We’ll give you and your daughter</i>
<i>a new name.</i>

37:32.160 --> 37:34.360
Then we’ll take you to a new city.

37:34.440 --> 37:36.320
Till then, you’ll stay with us.

37:36.400 --> 37:37.800
Come on, quickly!

38:11.680 --> 38:13.120
Mama!

38:36.560 --> 38:38.560
Why did you turn him over to them?

38:39.960 --> 38:42.200
So he can rest up
while serving his life sentence?

38:45.200 --> 38:46.520
Rest up?

38:48.480 --> 38:50.600
Death isn’t always a punishment.

38:52.400 --> 38:55.200
His whole life…

38:56.320 --> 39:00.720
he’ll sit in a cage
and stare into the dark.

39:01.960 --> 39:08.280
What do you think?
What’s worse-- that or death?

39:42.480 --> 39:44.080
Again without calling?

39:46.720 --> 39:48.280
This is becoming a habit.

39:52.960 --> 39:55.240
You know, recently I found out…

39:56.680 --> 39:58.760
that I can’t even
make small talk with anyone.

40:01.320 --> 40:02.800
I’m a sociopath.

40:03.960 --> 40:06.040
Welcome to the club.

40:07.640 --> 40:09.280
No, seriously.

40:14.600 --> 40:15.840
Anulya’s gone.

40:17.440 --> 40:18.840
Things are difficult with Papa.

40:21.160 --> 40:24.320
I don’t even want to talk to Sasha.
He whines about everything.

40:27.840 --> 40:29.840
I can only talk to you.

40:31.200 --> 40:32.400
Do you understand?

40:33.680 --> 40:36.000
We’re the same somehow.

40:37.200 --> 40:38.800
And how is Meglin?

40:39.840 --> 40:41.360
Wonderful and terrible?

40:45.280 --> 40:47.000
I don’t want to talk about him.

40:51.200 --> 40:53.920
So we’ll only talk about
what you want to talk about.

40:55.240 --> 40:58.280
And then, if you want to, you’ll fuck me.

40:58.360 --> 41:00.800
You won’t actually stay the night.
Other stuff to do, right? I tell you, you understand everything.

41:07.120 --> 41:08.800
Listen, what am I to you?

41:10.760 --> 41:11.880
What am I to you?

41:12.680 --> 41:14.000
911?

41:14.800 --> 41:19.160
A dildo? A salve for your horniness?

41:20.280 --> 41:24.000
-You started to have feelings for him!
-Don’t talk nonsense.

41:24.080 --> 41:28.240
If you have problems with him,
go and work them out with him!

41:28.320 --> 41:31.040
Why the hell
did you drag me into this shit?

41:31.800 --> 41:34.760
I’m not your mama.
And I’m not your friend, damn it.

41:35.880 --> 41:37.200
Is that clear?

41:47.200 --> 41:48.720
You shouldn’t have mentioned Mama.

41:49.960 --> 41:51.640
But you’re right about the rest.

41:55.120 --> 41:56.320
Time for you to go.

41:57.840 --> 41:59.320
Seriously?

42:02.640 --> 42:03.640
Bye.

42:39.880 --> 42:41.840
I could smell you from out there.

42:42.440 --> 42:44.040
Did you drink too much?

42:44.120 --> 42:46.960
By the way, I also had some snacks.

42:47.640 --> 42:51.120
So you really shouldn’t--
shouldn’t count on it.

42:51.200 --> 42:53.080
Yeah, I didn’t count on it anyway.

43:00.720 --> 43:04.200
But do you know why… I came over?

43:04.800 --> 43:06.400
You need more booze?

43:12.480 --> 43:14.440
Be quiet, okay?

43:18.400 --> 43:20.960
It really becomes you when you’re quiet.

43:24.160 --> 43:25.600
Why’d you come over?

43:33.640 --> 43:35.600
Yeah, I forgot.

43:38.960 --> 43:40.720
You’re a monk.

43:46.160 --> 43:47.360
You know what?

43:48.920 --> 43:53.040
You’ve given me the runaround so long
that now I need answers.

44:14.800 --> 44:17.520
You want some? Come on, come on.

44:29.480 --> 44:31.640
Come on. The answers.

44:46.160 --> 44:47.680
What’s this?

44:47.760 --> 44:49.360
These are all our kind.

44:51.600 --> 44:54.320
So that means these are all your people.

44:55.320 --> 44:56.520
How many are there?

44:56.600 --> 44:59.200
Enough to fill up a small town.

45:01.360 --> 45:03.600
So, 24 years ago,

45:03.680 --> 45:06.600
your father was the lead investigator
in the Olga Berestova case.

45:07.760 --> 45:09.960
A very beautiful woman.

45:10.040 --> 45:12.160
She was raped by someone
within the agency.

45:12.800 --> 45:17.720
And after developing PTSD,
she had a desire for revenge.

45:17.800 --> 45:20.560
She wanted to kill the guy
who did all of this to her.

45:20.640 --> 45:22.560
She found him by herself

45:22.640 --> 45:24.440
and killed him, slowly.

45:25.040 --> 45:26.200
Over two days.

45:26.280 --> 45:29.360
Then she killed a second guy
that looked like him.

45:29.440 --> 45:30.680
That was just the beginning.

45:30.760 --> 45:35.200
This desire turned into a bloody mania…
for revenge.

45:35.280 --> 45:36.760
They sentenced her to death.

45:36.840 --> 45:41.640
But your father insisted
that a second evaluation be performed.

45:41.720 --> 45:43.280
She was found criminally insane.

45:44.560 --> 45:45.760
Following that…

45:47.240 --> 45:50.960
they started making noise
about the Krasnoyarsk Killer.

45:52.720 --> 45:56.720
When we got involved with the case,
he’d already racked up 42 bodies.

45:56.800 --> 45:58.680
By the time we caught him…

46:00.280 --> 46:03.600
two suspects were shot, mistakenly,

46:03.680 --> 46:05.800
and the third hung himself in his cell.

46:06.560 --> 46:08.360
Hold on. You said “we.”

46:08.440 --> 46:10.280
We-- your father and I.

46:11.080 --> 46:12.600
You worked with my father?

46:13.200 --> 46:15.520
We still work together.
He’s my connection.

46:15.600 --> 46:18.680
I don’t have a phone,
and I need a connection.

46:18.760 --> 46:23.880
So here’s the thing. We couldn’t
pin anything on the Krasnoyarsk Killer.

46:23.960 --> 46:25.840
We had to release him.

46:25.920 --> 46:29.160
The higher-ups put on the pressure.
They needed a fall guy.

46:29.240 --> 46:34.680
Then your father remembered Berestova
and pinned all the murders on her.

46:35.280 --> 46:37.280
And what happened to the killer?

46:39.960 --> 46:41.680
He turned into a cactus.

46:46.840 --> 46:49.160
But you know that’s not all of it.

46:52.280 --> 46:53.600
Ask your father.

46:54.760 --> 46:58.360
Why.… did my father

46:58.880 --> 47:01.640
demand a second evaluation?

49:06.000 --> 49:07.200
Is she here?

49:10.240 --> 49:13.120
-Should I wake her?
-No, let her sleep.

49:14.560 --> 49:15.960
Give me a smoke, huh?

49:17.000 --> 49:19.520
-You quit.
-Well, yeah.

49:37.040 --> 49:38.640
Do you know where I messed up?

49:41.880 --> 49:44.720
At some point, I thought we were friends.

49:45.440 --> 49:47.440
After everything we’ve been through.

49:50.160 --> 49:51.960
But you don’t have friends.

49:54.720 --> 49:56.920
You don’t have human emotions.

49:57.680 --> 49:59.080
You’re different.

50:03.640 --> 50:07.400
Tomorrow, you’ll tell her
the training is over and send her home.

50:12.520 --> 50:13.600
Andrei.

50:15.040 --> 50:17.920
She doesn’t listen to her own father.

50:18.400 --> 50:21.520
Why do you think my words
will have some kind of effect?

50:22.440 --> 50:24.600
I don’t care how you do it.

50:25.160 --> 50:27.160
Come up with something. You’re the genius.

50:28.520 --> 50:29.720
And if I don’t?

50:38.360 --> 50:40.080
Don’t repeat my mistake.

50:41.320 --> 50:43.240
Don’t think that we’re friends.

50:53.480 --> 50:55.760
Go ahead
and talk a bit about Olga Berestova.

50:58.360 --> 50:59.600
Pardon me. Who?

51:00.200 --> 51:01.960
Olga Berestova.

51:06.160 --> 51:07.760
I don’t know who you’re talking about.

51:09.680 --> 51:11.520
This the first I’ve heard that name.

51:12.400 --> 51:15.720
Did we really mix something up?
It’s not likely.

51:18.160 --> 51:19.400
I don’t know.

51:20.560 --> 51:22.680
It’s natural to make mistakes.

51:27.640 --> 51:31.520
<i>He simply nods his head,</i>
<i>and the tiger immediately obeys him.</i>

51:31.600 --> 51:34.840
<i>There were times when they fought off</i>
<i>these predators as a team.</i>

51:34.920 --> 51:38.720
MOSCOW

51:38.800 --> 51:42.760
THE CIRCUS
IGOR AND IRINA BORISYUK

51:42.840 --> 51:46.280
<i>…he assures us that he feels</i>
<i>more comfortable in a cage with predators</i>

51:46.360 --> 51:48.360
<i>than out on the streets today.</i> Subtitle translation by Amelia Wolford
