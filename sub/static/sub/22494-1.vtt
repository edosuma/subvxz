00:12.353 --> 00:12.986
All right.

00:13.020 --> 00:14.821
We've been doing this
for four seasons.

00:14.855 --> 00:15.722
You know the drill.

00:15.756 --> 00:16.723
Fast and hard, people.

00:18.426 --> 00:21.461
Blam! Let's give them all a
taste of the bitch pudding!

00:21.529 --> 00:24.564
I can't promise everyone they'll
survive season five, but

00:24.598 --> 00:26.099
I know you'll make me proud.

00:26.167 --> 00:29.269
Sunshine Cowboy, you're new,
so I'm expecting great things.

00:32.273 --> 00:33.807
Let's do it!

00:33.874 --> 00:34.908
Aah!

00:36.577 --> 00:38.545
Aw!

00:46.787 --> 00:50.323
I'll tell your story.

00:50.357 --> 00:53.426
I'll tell
Seth Green's story.

00:53.461 --> 00:56.996
Your story has less commercial appeal.

00:57.031 --> 00:58.631
No! Water!

00:58.666 --> 01:00.600
My only weakness!

01:00.634 --> 01:02.135
Aw, bullets!

01:02.169 --> 01:04.137
My only weakness!

01:04.171 --> 01:06.139
Oh!

01:23.057 --> 01:26.326
Geez, I can't believe they
think a "Saving Private Ryan"

01:26.360 --> 01:35.135
parody is still fresh and original.

01:36.036 --> 01:37.670
I need a medic up in this bitch!

01:37.705 --> 01:40.874
Looks like someone
hasn't been flossing.

01:40.941 --> 01:44.043
Ow! You one-dimensional
son of a whore!

01:44.111 --> 01:49.315
Our father, who farts in
heaven, Halloween thy name!

01:49.350 --> 01:51.684
Oh!
Who's even shooting at us?!

01:51.752 --> 01:55.655
It's just a metaphor for
season five, stupid!

01:55.689 --> 01:57.290
Aw, "Parent Trap," "Mean Girls,"

01:57.324 --> 01:58.591
"Herbie," "Georgia Rule."

01:58.659 --> 02:01.394

Blockheads, you are charged
with murder in the first degree

03:20.074 --> 03:23.676
of Glen Gumberson, A.K.A. Gumby.

03:45.332 --> 03:46.899
How does the jury find?

03:46.934 --> 03:48.334
Guilty as [bleep]

03:48.369 --> 03:53.339
Sentencing is scheduled for...
Now, and it's death.

04:04.718 --> 04:06.786
Mom, can we have a snack?

04:06.820 --> 04:08.988
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.

04:14.194 --> 04:15.928
Voldemort! Hey, no-nose!

04:15.996 --> 04:17.563
Smell you later, sir.

04:18.432 --> 04:20.767
Where's your [bleep] nose, man?

04:22.569 --> 04:24.037
I'm sick of all the stares.

04:24.104 --> 04:25.271
I want the nose job.

04:25.306 --> 04:26.739
This is a big decision.

04:26.807 --> 04:29.008
You need to be 100% sure you're ready.

04:30.177 --> 04:31.010
I'm ready.

04:31.045 --> 04:31.811
Cut me!

04:31.845 --> 04:35.915
...A nice nose...
That is a great-looking nose.

04:35.949 --> 04:36.749
Nose.

04:36.817 --> 04:38.651
Wonderful no...
Ow!

04:38.719 --> 04:40.720
Thanks for the new wand,
Mr. Ollivander.

04:40.754 --> 04:43.656
Nothing's too good for James Potter.

04:45.259 --> 04:48.094
Ow! My [bleep] no... Ow!

04:48.128 --> 04:49.896
Oh, do you validate?

04:49.930 --> 04:50.997
Sorry, no.

04:51.065 --> 04:53.466
I'll get you, Potter, someday!

04:53.534 --> 04:55.902
Hey, Voldemort, why
so bent out of shape?

04:56.704 --> 04:59.739
He looks angry enough to
kill that guy's baby.

05:02.876 --> 05:06.245
I can watch my kids bang
on pots and pans at home for free.

05:07.348 --> 05:10.483
Please, God, make it stop.

05:16.623 --> 05:18.124

Ho!

06:21.321 --> 06:22.755
A skydiving proposal?

06:22.790 --> 06:24.557
Baby, of course I'll marry you!

06:24.558 --> 06:26.659
I wish my parents could see this!

06:26.727 --> 06:30.463
Then maybe you should turn around.

06:30.531 --> 06:31.998
Mom, dad!

06:32.032 --> 06:33.699
Congratulations, honey!

06:33.734 --> 06:36.202
Now, you treat her right, you hear?

06:36.270 --> 06:37.904
This calls for a toast.

06:37.971 --> 06:39.005
Bubbly, anyone?

06:39.039 --> 06:39.972
Champagne?

06:40.007 --> 06:41.274
What a surprise.

06:41.341 --> 06:42.175
Amazing!

06:44.978 --> 06:47.079
Who is that?

06:48.549 --> 06:49.782
Ted!

06:49.817 --> 06:51.784
How could you do it, Cindy?

06:51.819 --> 06:53.719
How could you say yes to him?!

06:54.788 --> 06:57.690
Put the gun down, you're mine, Cindy!

06:58.826 --> 07:00.526
You can't have her!

07:00.594 --> 07:01.694
She's mine!

07:01.762 --> 07:02.962
God damn it!

07:03.030 --> 07:06.499
Take it!

07:06.567 --> 07:08.701
Don't! Don't!

07:14.041 --> 07:14.607
No!

07:14.641 --> 07:16.142
Oh, shh, shh!

07:16.210 --> 07:17.310
It's okay.

07:17.344 --> 07:19.011

07:36.330 --> 07:37.597
Everyone working hard today?

07:37.664 --> 07:38.831
You better believe it.

07:38.866 --> 07:39.832
We love to work.

07:39.867 --> 07:42.935
You are preaching to the mother-f'ing
choir there, my friends.

07:42.970 --> 07:43.669
How about you?

07:43.737 --> 07:46.572
You like to work?

07:46.640 --> 07:48.474
Y-yes.

07:48.509 --> 07:49.108
Oh, yeah?

07:49.142 --> 07:53.746

Yeah, yeah.

07:57.050 --> 07:59.218
Me love the fraggle rock, too.

07:59.253 --> 08:06.025
Let me see your work visa, son.

08:06.059 --> 08:08.928
Me love the fraggle rock?

08:08.962 --> 08:10.530
All right, all right, okay.

08:10.564 --> 08:11.931
Get this guy out of here.

08:11.965 --> 08:14.534
M-me love...
That is a one-way ticket back

08:14.568 --> 08:15.835
across the border, son.

08:15.869 --> 08:17.637
Shut it down, doozers!

08:17.671 --> 08:19.805
I think we almost won today.

08:19.840 --> 08:20.840
Good effort.

08:20.874 --> 08:22.174
Oh, shut up, beast man!

08:22.209 --> 08:25.478
He-Man put his heel right in my
balls, did a [bleep] pirouette!

08:25.512 --> 08:26.746
I can still feel them unwinding.

08:26.780 --> 08:27.747
What?!

08:29.716 --> 08:31.817
Well, I'm sorry, choppers,
but your adjustable-rate

08:31.852 --> 08:32.618
mortgage came due.

08:32.653 --> 08:36.155
But... but... but this balloon
payment is astronomical!

08:36.188 --> 08:39.258
You never told me that I was...
It's called "fine print," chuckles.

08:39.293 --> 08:41.827
Maybe you need some eyeballs
instead of those eye... holes.

08:41.895 --> 08:45.898
Oh, I'll get the money...
When I crush He-Man once...

08:45.966 --> 08:48.367
Bud, lie to me, but
don't lie to yourself.

08:48.402 --> 08:51.270
You really gonna crush He-Man
by the 15th of this month?

08:51.305 --> 08:52.438
Eeeeaaaaah!

08:52.472 --> 08:56.242
Well... that property's,
what, 12,000 square feet?

08:56.276 --> 08:57.777
Duplex that bitch.

08:57.811 --> 09:01.447
Okay, well, rent's due on the
first of the month, and I will

09:01.515 --> 09:05.318
hold your security deposit in escrow...
Dude, I've never got a

09:05.352 --> 09:07.520
security deposit back in my life.

09:07.554 --> 09:08.321
What?

09:08.355 --> 09:09.088

10:13.353 --> 10:18.124
No! I'm here to... tell you...
There's a rival frat

10:18.158 --> 10:21.460
that's totally talking
crap all about you, man!

10:21.495 --> 10:22.228
Say what?

10:25.432 --> 10:26.666
No way!

10:26.733 --> 10:27.299
Yep.

10:27.367 --> 10:31.370
They say you're not the number-one
frat at Eternia Tech anymore.

10:31.405 --> 10:32.571
The hell we aren't!

10:32.606 --> 10:34.106
We'll show those assholes!

10:34.141 --> 10:35.741
Yeah!

10:35.776 --> 10:36.475
Whoo!

10:41.248 --> 10:44.483
Who's the number-one
frat now, retards?

10:46.219 --> 10:47.386
We'll be right down.

10:51.158 --> 10:52.458
Ahh.

10:52.492 --> 10:54.827
You're still overdue on
that mortgage, Smurfy.

10:54.861 --> 10:58.898
Oh, I've got a solution for that, too.

10:58.932 --> 11:00.132
What are you doing?!

11:00.200 --> 11:01.734
Oh, I don't know.

11:01.768 --> 11:03.569

Mr. Skeletor, I don't know
what you're suggesting, but...

11:07.274 --> 11:09.208
Close the door.

11:09.276 --> 11:10.376
No teeth, okay?

11:10.444 --> 11:12.378
Yeah, good luck with that.
