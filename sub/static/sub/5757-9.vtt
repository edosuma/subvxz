WEBVTT

00:05.005 --> 00:07.441
WHAT YOU GOT THERE?
IT COULD BE EVIDENCE.

00:07.475 --> 00:09.043
LET GO! STOP IT!

00:09.077 --> 00:10.411
NO MORE QUESTIONS.

00:10.444 --> 00:11.712
MIKE.
BACK OFF!

00:11.745 --> 00:13.481
WHAT IS GOING ON?

00:13.514 --> 00:15.649
SHOULD I HURRY UP AND TALK FAST
BEFORE YOU MOVE OUT AGAIN?

00:15.683 --> 00:17.351
Hanna: CALEB, THERE'S
SOMEONE FOLLOWING YOU.

00:17.385 --> 00:18.719
I THINK IT'S A COP.

00:18.752 --> 00:21.355
HANNA,
I'LL DEAL WITH THIS.

00:21.389 --> 00:23.257
ARE YOU OKAY?

00:23.291 --> 00:26.460
YOUR PANELS CAME BACK
WITH HIGH LEVELS OF HGH
IN YOUR BLOODSTREAM.

00:26.494 --> 00:28.129
HUMAN GROWTH HORMONE?

00:28.162 --> 00:29.530
I'VE NEVER TAKEN THAT!

00:29.563 --> 00:30.764
WHY WOULD HE GO
BACK TO ISABEL?

00:30.798 --> 00:32.400
DO YOU WANT TO BE
WITH HIM OR NOT?

00:32.433 --> 00:34.168
I THOUGHT THAT'S
WHAT YOU WANTED.
I DON'T.

00:34.202 --> 00:36.137
YOU TOOK THIS?
WE'RE GONNA GIVE IT BACK.

00:36.170 --> 00:38.206
THE BLOW TO HER HEAD
ISN'T WHAT KILLED HER.

00:38.239 --> 00:39.673
ALISON WAS BURIED ALIVE.

00:39.707 --> 00:41.242
ALI'S KILLER IS DEAD.

00:41.275 --> 00:42.843
I'm not so sure.

00:42.876 --> 00:45.546
SHOULD I BE WORRIED
ABOUT YOU AND THIS
JASON GUY?

00:45.579 --> 00:47.281
WHAT? NO!

00:47.315 --> 00:49.683
"CURVED, BLUNT WEAPON."
THAT'S A HOCKEY STICK, EM.

00:49.717 --> 00:51.819
BE CAREFUL!

00:51.852 --> 00:54.422
TOO BAD. YOU'RE NOT
GONNA GET A SECOND
CHANCE, ALI.

00:54.455 --> 00:56.090
WHAT DO THEY
KNOW ABOUT JASON?

00:56.124 --> 00:57.691
I'M NOT SURE, BUT THEY'RE
DEFINITELY QUESTIONING

00:57.725 --> 00:58.692
WHETHER IAN KILLED HER.

00:58.726 --> 01:00.094
WHERE'S PAGE FIVE?

01:00.128 --> 01:02.830
HERE'S PAGE ONE,
TWO, THREE, FOUR.

01:02.863 --> 01:05.533
PAGE SIX.
WHERE THE HELL
IS PAGE FIVE?

01:07.501 --> 01:10.204
Female Vocalist:
 * YOU COULD HAVE
 HAD ME, BABY *

01:10.238 --> 01:13.474
* A LONG TIME
 AGO, BABY *

01:13.507 --> 01:16.177
* EASIER THAN YOU KNOW

01:18.246 --> 01:20.281
* YOU WERE THE SUN
 ( alarm blares )

01:20.314 --> 01:21.682
Wait. One second.

01:21.715 --> 01:25.486
* OR THE MOON
 PULLING MY TIDE *

01:25.519 --> 01:28.789
* YOU WERE THE CLOUDS

01:28.822 --> 01:30.791
* WRAPPING ROUND MY
 HEAD IN THE SKY, BABY *

01:30.824 --> 01:33.161
WHERE WERE WE?

01:33.194 --> 01:36.096
( alarm blares )

01:41.435 --> 01:42.803
UGH! SMELLS LIKE
DEATH OUT HERE.

01:42.836 --> 01:44.805
GO IN THERE AND TELL
SPENCER TO HURRY UP.

01:44.838 --> 01:46.440
I DON'T WANT TO SEE
DEAD BODIES.

01:46.474 --> 01:48.176
OH, COME ON, EM,
YOU LOVE ZOMBIE MOVIES.

01:48.209 --> 01:50.744
I LIKE WATCHING THEM.
I DON'T WANT TO BE IN ONE.

01:50.778 --> 01:53.181
They're coming over here.
What do we do?

01:53.214 --> 01:55.916
Pretend like you're
supposed to be here.

01:55.949 --> 01:58.319
SO I WAS TELLING
THE PATIENT IN 212,

01:58.352 --> 02:00.321
"I AM NOT SHAVING THAT!"

02:00.354 --> 02:02.790
( indistinct conversation )

02:04.492 --> 02:07.461
Spencer!
Time to go! Now!

02:09.597 --> 02:11.365
DID YOU FIND
THE MISSING PAGE?

02:11.399 --> 02:12.800
NO. I LOOKED IN
THE CABINET WHERE WE
FOUND ALI'S FOLDER.

02:12.833 --> 02:14.668
I EVEN TRIED
THE CORONER'S COMPUTER,

02:14.702 --> 02:16.337
BUT IT'S
PASSWORD-PROTECTED.

02:16.370 --> 02:18.572
HOW CAN ONE PAGE
JUST DISAPPEAR?

02:18.606 --> 02:20.574
MY GUESS IS SOMEONE
GOT IN HERE BEFORE US.

02:20.608 --> 02:22.510
SOMEBODY LIKE JASON?

02:22.543 --> 02:24.245
DO YOU THINK THERE WAS
SOMETHING IN THERE THAT
MIGHT HAVE NAILED HIM,

02:24.278 --> 02:25.413
SOMETHING
THE COPS OVERLOOKED?

02:25.446 --> 02:26.647
THE ONLY EVIDENCE
WE HAVE AGAINST HIM

02:26.680 --> 02:28.582
IS THAT HE'S A CREEP.

02:28.616 --> 02:30.318
THAT'S NOT TRUE.
WE KNOW THAT IT WAS
A HOCKEY STICK

02:30.351 --> 02:31.785
THAT PROBABLY
KNOCKED ALI OUT,

02:31.819 --> 02:33.854
AND JASON HAD MY STICK.

02:33.887 --> 02:35.723
THE FIRST THING
I'M GONNA DO WHEN THEY
TAKE THE BANDAGES OFF

02:35.756 --> 02:37.725
IS GO TO CAPE MAY.

02:37.758 --> 02:39.827
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE
THE OCEAN AGAIN.

02:43.597 --> 02:45.199
NURSE:
You must be so excited.

02:45.233 --> 02:48.336
The tests will only
take a few minutes.

02:55.476 --> 02:57.611
* GOT A SECRET,
 CAN YOU KEEP IT *

02:57.645 --> 03:00.214
* SWEAR THIS ONE
 YOU'LL SAVE *

03:00.248 --> 03:02.683
* BETTER LOCK IT
 IN YOUR POCKET *

03:02.716 --> 03:05.253
* TAKIN' THIS ONE
 TO THE GRAVE *

03:05.286 --> 03:07.421
* IF I SHOW YOU
 THEN I KNOW YOU *

03:07.455 --> 03:10.324
* WON'T TELL WHAT I SAID

03:10.358 --> 03:14.962
* 'CAUSE TWO CAN KEEP A SECRET
 IF ONE OF THEM IS DEAD *

03:18.666 --> 03:20.768
WAIT, SO YOU THINK THAT
"A" CAME IN HERE

03:20.801 --> 03:22.370
WHEN WE WEREN'T HOME
AND SHOT STEROIDS

03:22.403 --> 03:24.505
INTO EVERY
CREAM YOU OWNED?

03:24.538 --> 03:26.507
YES, I DO.

03:26.540 --> 03:29.277
I'M SORRY YOU'RE
GOING THROUGH THIS, EM.

03:29.310 --> 03:30.411
HEY, THAT'S MINE!

03:30.444 --> 03:32.246
I'M THROWING OUT
YOUR STUFF TOO.

03:32.280 --> 03:33.714
THINK ABOUT IT:

03:33.747 --> 03:35.283
THERE'S NO WAY "A"
COULD KNOW

03:35.316 --> 03:36.717
WHICH LOTIONS ARE MINE
AND WHICH ONES ARE YOURS.

03:36.750 --> 03:39.520
I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.

03:39.553 --> 03:41.589
BUT NOT THAT ONE.

03:41.622 --> 03:43.257
I DON'T CARE
IF I TURN INTO THOR,

03:43.291 --> 03:45.559
THIS SOY MOISTURIZER
COST ME A HUNDRED BUCKS.

03:45.593 --> 03:47.961
OKAY, YOU DIDN'T BUY IT,
YOU STOLE IT.

03:47.995 --> 03:50.931
SO WHAT? IT'S STILL
A HUNDRED BUCKS.

03:50.964 --> 03:52.800
YOU KNOW, CHIN HAIRS
AND BACK PIMPLES

03:52.833 --> 03:55.303
ARE ALSO SIDE EFFECTS
OF TAKING STEROIDS.

03:55.336 --> 03:57.738
HMM. CAN'T BE TOO SAFE.

03:59.640 --> 04:01.041
'MORNING, GIRLS.

04:01.074 --> 04:02.743
HANNA, YOUR DAD CALLED.

04:02.776 --> 04:04.312
HE WANTS YOU TO CALL HIM BACK
BEFORE YOU GO TO SCHOOL.

04:04.345 --> 04:05.679
WHATEVER.

04:05.713 --> 04:07.281
Female Vocalist:
 * ONE STEP FORWARD...

04:07.315 --> 04:09.550
YOU HAVEN'T SPOKEN
TO YOUR DAD YET?

04:09.583 --> 04:12.520
NO, NOT SINCE HE LEFT.

04:13.921 --> 04:16.557
COME ON, LET'S
GO EAT BREAKFAST.

04:16.589 --> 04:18.024
I'M NOT HUNGRY.

04:18.058 --> 04:20.928
EM, YOU'VE BARELY EATEN
SINCE YOU LEFT THE HOSPITAL,

04:20.961 --> 04:22.430
AND LICKING
THE SALT OFF OF PRETZELS

04:22.463 --> 04:24.465
DOES NOT COUNT AS LUNCH!

04:24.498 --> 04:26.300
I CAN'T EAT ANYTHING.

04:26.334 --> 04:27.935
I STILL FEEL QUEASY
THINKING ABOUT WHAT "A"

04:27.968 --> 04:29.437
IS GOING TO DO TO ME NEXT.

04:29.470 --> 04:31.972
LOOK, EM, I GET IT.
BELIEVE ME, I DO.

04:32.005 --> 04:34.508
BUT WE CAN'T LET "A"
CONTROL US LIKE THIS.

04:34.542 --> 04:36.910
THE BEST THING FOR YOU
TO DO IS JUST...

04:36.944 --> 04:39.380
TRY TO PUT IT
OUT OF YOUR MIND.

04:42.350 --> 04:45.453
( cellphone plinks )

04:54.495 --> 04:56.330
HANNA'S RIGHT.
 NO ONE OWNS YOU, EM.

04:56.364 --> 04:58.999
THIS BITCH IS JUST
TRYING TO SCARE YOU.

04:59.032 --> 05:01.469
WELL, IT'S WORKING.

05:01.502 --> 05:03.036
DID YOU FIND OUT WHY
YOUR BROTHER BROKE
INTO MY GARAGE?

05:03.070 --> 05:05.506
HE'S NOT TALKING TO ME...
OR ANYBODY.

05:05.539 --> 05:08.041
HE WON'T EVEN RETURN CALLS
FROM HIS BEST FRIEND.

05:08.075 --> 05:09.777
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH HIM?

05:09.810 --> 05:11.111
I HAVE NO IDEA.

05:11.144 --> 05:12.713
MY PARENTS,
THEY KEEP TURNING TO ME,

05:12.746 --> 05:15.449
THINKING I'M GONNA
HAVE THE ANSWERS.

05:16.950 --> 05:19.520
What's he doing here?

05:19.553 --> 05:20.721
Um...

05:20.754 --> 05:24.392
he counsels kids
on substance abuse.

05:24.425 --> 05:25.993
Why is he waving at you?

05:26.026 --> 05:29.963
'Cause he had dinner
at my house the other night.

05:29.997 --> 05:31.732
Did something happen
at this dinner

05:31.765 --> 05:33.701
that you
didn't tell us about?

05:33.734 --> 05:35.068
No.
Then why are you blushing?

05:35.102 --> 05:36.837
Because I had a dream
about him last night.

05:36.870 --> 05:39.440
Stop asking questions.

05:39.473 --> 05:41.442
WHAT KIND OF A DREAM?

05:41.475 --> 05:43.711
WE WERE IN BED, NAKED.

05:43.744 --> 05:45.446
HE TRIED TO KISS ME,
AND THEN I WOKE UP.

05:45.479 --> 05:47.047
OH, MY GOD,
HOW COULD YOU?

05:47.080 --> 05:49.417
I CAN'T CONTROL WHAT
MY BRAIN DOES WHEN
I'M SLEEPING!

05:49.450 --> 05:52.152
ARIA, HE MIGHT BE
A KILLER!

05:52.185 --> 05:55.022
JASON IS NO MORE DANGEROUS
THAN WE THOUGHT TOBY WAS
A FEW MONTHS AGO.

05:55.055 --> 05:56.557
TOBY WAS NEVER
LINKED TO A WEAPON

05:56.590 --> 05:57.891
THAT COULD HAVE
DENTED ALI'S SKULL.

05:57.925 --> 05:59.627
"COULD HAVE"
DOESN'T MEAN HE DID.

05:59.660 --> 06:02.396
LOOK, I CAN SEE WHY
YOU'RE ATTRACTED TO HIM.

06:02.430 --> 06:04.398
HE'S MYSTERIOUS AND WOUNDED,

06:04.432 --> 06:06.066
AND WE ALL KNOW YOU
LOVE TO FIX THINGS,

06:06.099 --> 06:08.068
BUT YOU'RE
PLAYING WITH FIRE.

06:08.101 --> 06:09.937
AND BESIDES, WHY ARE YOU
DREAMING ABOUT JASON

06:09.970 --> 06:11.405
WHEN YOU
ALREADY HAVE EZRA?

06:11.439 --> 06:14.675
'CAUSE I DON'T...

06:14.708 --> 06:16.444
HAVE EZRA.

06:16.477 --> 06:18.646
I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS
GONNA BE SO MUCH EASIER

06:18.679 --> 06:20.814
WHEN HE WENT TO HOLLIS.

06:20.848 --> 06:23.617
IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY TIME
WE START TO TAKE
A STEP FORWARD,

06:23.651 --> 06:25.719
SOMEONE OR SOMETHING
GETS IN OUR WAY.

06:25.753 --> 06:28.121
YOU GUYS LOVE EACH OTHER.

06:28.155 --> 06:30.524
YOU JUST NEED TO FIND
A WAY TO CONNECT AGAIN.

06:32.726 --> 06:34.862
CAN WE KEEP THIS
CONVERSATION BETWEEN US?

06:34.895 --> 06:38.566
IF YOU PROMISE TO STAY
AWAY FROM JASON.

06:49.543 --> 06:51.044
I JUST SPOKE TO
YOUR FATHER AGAIN.

06:51.078 --> 06:52.580
YOU NEVER CALLED HIM BACK.

06:52.613 --> 06:54.014
HE WANTS YOU TO TALK
TO ISABEL.

06:54.047 --> 06:56.083
ISABEL? WHY?

06:56.116 --> 06:57.751
SHE NEEDS TO SCHEDULE
 A FITTING FOR YOUR
 BRIDESMAID'S DRESS.

06:57.785 --> 06:59.887
NO, I'M NOT GONNA
BE A BRIDESMAID.

06:59.920 --> 07:02.523
IT'S A NICE GESTURE.

07:02.556 --> 07:04.191
YOU KNOW, I DON'T
EVEN KNOW THE WOMAN.

07:04.224 --> 07:07.127
IT'S TOO WEIRD.
 DO WHAT YOU WANT.

07:07.160 --> 07:09.229
WHATEVER YOU DECIDE,
YOU NEED TO CALL
YOUR FATHER BACK.

07:09.262 --> 07:11.632
TELL HIM YOURSELF.
FINE.

07:12.700 --> 07:15.202
( sighs )

07:15.235 --> 07:17.538
She's getting tested
to see if she qualifies

07:17.571 --> 07:19.773
for a prosthetic
cornea transplant.

07:19.807 --> 07:21.041
ARIA:
English, please.

07:21.074 --> 07:22.543
They're gonna see
if they can replace

07:22.576 --> 07:23.844
the damaged part
of her eyes.

07:23.877 --> 07:24.978
What are we talking about?

07:25.012 --> 07:26.480
Jenna.

07:26.514 --> 07:28.716
They're taking out
her eyeballs?

07:28.749 --> 07:30.117
No, it's not
the whole eyeball.

07:30.150 --> 07:31.585
It's just the flap
over the pupil.

07:31.619 --> 07:33.120
Could we not talk
about eye flaps

07:33.153 --> 07:34.688
while we're eating, please?

07:34.722 --> 07:37.257
They really think that
this can work?

07:37.290 --> 07:38.859
SPENCER:
I don't know.

07:38.892 --> 07:40.728
Toby says she still needs
to take more tests

07:40.761 --> 07:43.163
to see if she qualifies,
but... it's possible.

07:43.196 --> 07:45.165
So, if Jenna gets
her sight back,

07:45.198 --> 07:47.868
does that mean that
we're off the hook for...

07:47.901 --> 07:50.170
No. I mean,
guilt-wise, maybe,

07:50.203 --> 07:52.806
but if you break
somebody's leg with
a baseball bat,

07:52.840 --> 07:55.242
even if that leg heals,
you could still be
charged with assault.

07:55.275 --> 07:57.210
She wouldn't come
after us...

07:57.244 --> 07:59.179
if she still thinks
we have Ali's tape.
But we don't.

07:59.212 --> 08:01.815
And that'll be much easier
for her to figure out
if she can see.

08:01.849 --> 08:03.183
Guys, maybe if
she can see again,

08:03.216 --> 08:05.519
we can stop
all this whispering.

08:05.553 --> 08:07.521
She'll lose her taste
for revenge.

08:07.555 --> 08:09.189
Yeah, or things
could get worse.

08:09.222 --> 08:11.525
It's already so bad.
How can it get worse?

08:11.559 --> 08:14.828
Well, for one,
she will be able
to aim a gun.

08:14.862 --> 08:16.630
Look, Spencer's right.

08:16.664 --> 08:18.966
Jenna's scary enough
with four senses.

08:18.999 --> 08:21.802
Can you imagine what
she's gonna do to us
with all five?

08:37.784 --> 08:39.986
( distant chainsaw whirrs )

08:43.756 --> 08:47.695
( tree trunk
creaks and falls )

09:05.779 --> 09:07.748
HEY, WHOA, WHOA,
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

09:07.781 --> 09:09.316
YOU DO NOT GO IN THERE,
YOU UNDERSTAND?

09:19.727 --> 09:20.928
( lock clicks )

09:31.805 --> 09:34.608
( twig snaps )

09:50.858 --> 09:52.826
CHOCOLATE CHIP.
MY FAVORITE.

09:52.860 --> 09:54.361
PLEASE TELL ME
YOU CAN EAT THESE.

09:54.394 --> 09:56.630
AS LONG AS THAT'S NOT
JALAPENO FROSTING.

10:00.200 --> 10:03.270
OH. HI.
HI.
HI.

10:03.303 --> 10:04.672
I'M ASHLEY.

10:04.705 --> 10:07.240
THIS IS HANNA'S MOM.
THIS IS SAMARA.

10:07.274 --> 10:10.077
NICE TO MEET YOU, SAMARA.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

10:10.110 --> 10:11.378
DO YOU WANT
TO GO INSIDE?

10:11.411 --> 10:12.980
ACTUALLY,
I CAN'T STAY LONG.

10:13.013 --> 10:14.982
I HAVE TO RUN TO
A CAMPUS PRIDE MEETING,

10:15.015 --> 10:16.984
BUT I WANTED
TO TELL YOU THAT
QUINN'S MOM GOT SICK,

10:17.017 --> 10:18.852
SO WE CAN'T HANG
AT HER HOUSE TONIGHT.

10:18.886 --> 10:20.988
NO WAY. I WAS
LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.

10:21.021 --> 10:24.825
I WAS DYING FOR YOU
TO MEET MY FRIENDS.

10:24.858 --> 10:28.128
YOU'RE MORE THAN WELCOME
TO HAVE YOUR FRIENDS
HERE TONIGHT.

10:28.161 --> 10:29.730
HANNA AND I WILL
BOTH BE OUT,

10:29.763 --> 10:31.765
SO YOU'LL HAVE
THE PLACE TO YOURSELF.

10:31.799 --> 10:34.067
THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

10:34.101 --> 10:35.736
OKAY.

10:37.037 --> 10:38.371
I'LL CALL YOU LATER.

10:42.342 --> 10:44.444
THAT WAS REALLY NICE
OF YOU TO OFFER,

10:44.477 --> 10:46.279
BUT WE CAN FIND
SOMEWHERE ELSE TO GO.

10:46.313 --> 10:48.281
EMILY,
THIS IS YOUR HOME TOO.

10:48.315 --> 10:51.084
I WANT YOU TO FEEL
COMFORTABLE HAVING
YOUR FRIENDS OVER.

10:51.118 --> 10:52.753
MORE IMPORTANTLY,
I WANT YOU TO FEEL

10:52.786 --> 10:56.056
COMFORTABLE
BEING YOURSELF.
UNDERSTAND?

10:56.089 --> 10:58.091
YEAH. I DO.

10:58.125 --> 11:01.128
THE SAME RULES FOR
HANNA APPLY FOR YOU:

11:01.161 --> 11:03.363
NO GIRLFRIENDS
ALLOWED IN THE BEDROOM,

11:03.396 --> 11:06.867
JUST GIRL FRIENDS.

11:06.900 --> 11:08.969
WAIT-- HOW WILL I
KNOW THE DIFFERENCE?

11:09.002 --> 11:10.704
I'LL LET YOU KNOW.

11:10.738 --> 11:11.939
OKAY.

11:23.884 --> 11:27.755
UGH! WHY IS IT
SO HOT IN HERE?

11:27.788 --> 11:29.422
AREN'T YOU HOT?

11:29.456 --> 11:31.992
( gulps )
I AM NOW.

11:32.025 --> 11:35.295
I'VE BEEN THINKING...

11:35.328 --> 11:37.297
THAT WE COULD USE
SOME ALONE TIME.

11:37.330 --> 11:39.900
( female vocalist
 singing bluesy tune )

11:39.933 --> 11:41.234
HOW DO YOU LOCK THIS THING?

11:41.268 --> 11:43.003
UH, IT DOESN'T LOCK.

11:48.075 --> 11:50.778
* WANNA SWIM IN THE SEA?

11:50.811 --> 11:55.215
* WELL, YOU WILL NEVER
 FIND A GIRL LIKE ME *

11:55.248 --> 11:56.750
OH, MAN!

11:56.784 --> 12:00.220
* NO, BABY,
 NOT LIKE ME *

12:03.991 --> 12:06.359
* WELL, I CAN'T
 HELP MYSELF *

12:06.393 --> 12:09.096
I-I HAVE CLASS
IN 15 MINUTES.

12:09.129 --> 12:10.397
THAT'S PLENTY OF TIME.

12:10.430 --> 12:12.199
* SO MAKE THE CALL

12:12.232 --> 12:13.533
* I JUST WANT YOU

12:13.566 --> 12:15.936
* TO WANT TO WANT IT ALL

12:18.571 --> 12:21.141
MAYBE THIS ISN'T
SUCH A GOOD IDEA.

12:21.174 --> 12:23.143
UM, I THINK...

12:23.176 --> 12:25.445
THAT YOU SPEND ENTIRELY

12:25.478 --> 12:27.915
TOO MUCH TIME THINKING.

12:27.948 --> 12:29.249
DON'T YOU THINK?

12:29.282 --> 12:31.751
( chuckles )
YEAH.

12:33.420 --> 12:36.423
* LET'S DO IT ALL AGAIN

12:40.093 --> 12:42.129
* WELL, I CAN'T
 HELP MYSELF *

12:42.162 --> 12:44.064
* I WANT IT ALL

12:44.097 --> 12:47.067
I'M TELLING YOU,
JASON IS HIDING
SOMETHING IN THERE.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.336
LIKE WHAT?
 I DON'T KNOW...

12:49.369 --> 12:52.539
BUT HE RAN ACROSS
 THAT YARD LIKE HIS
 HEAD WAS ON FIRE.

12:52.572 --> 12:54.842
HE DID NOT WANT THAT GUY
GOING IN THE SHED.

12:54.875 --> 12:57.077
MAN:
Listen, anyway, um...

13:00.547 --> 13:03.350
I GOTTA GO.
I-I'LL CALL YOU LATER.

13:05.886 --> 13:08.121
MY NUMBER'S ON THERE,

13:08.155 --> 13:10.257
IN CASE YOU WANT
TO CALL ME, OKAY?

13:10.290 --> 13:12.259
GOOD LUCK.
THANKS.

13:16.363 --> 13:17.831
HEY.

13:17.865 --> 13:19.599
HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHY IS HE BACK?

13:19.632 --> 13:21.568
WHO?
HIM.

13:21.601 --> 13:23.570
THAT'S THE COP
WHO WAS STALKING YOU.

13:23.603 --> 13:27.174
HANNA, HE'S NOT A COP.
HE'S A PRIVATE
INVESTIGATOR.

13:27.207 --> 13:28.842
WELL, WHAT DOES HE WANT?

13:28.876 --> 13:32.079
HE WAS HIRED BY
SOMEBODY TO FIND ME.

13:32.112 --> 13:33.413
WHO?

13:34.948 --> 13:36.984
MY MOTHER.

13:39.386 --> 13:41.588
( up-tempo music playing )

13:47.094 --> 13:49.062
Samara:
FULL HOUSE, AGAIN.

13:49.096 --> 13:50.630
Quinn: DAMN,
EM, YOU CLEANED UP!

13:50.663 --> 13:53.533
GIRL, YOU SUCK
AT THIS GAME!

13:53.566 --> 13:55.502
DEAL ME OUT.
I'LL GO GET DESSERT.

13:55.535 --> 13:57.470
WAIT, EM, HELP ME.
I'M DOWN TO MY LAST DOLLAR.

13:59.172 --> 14:00.107
KEEP THESE.

14:04.111 --> 14:07.014
I'LL TAKE ONE.

14:07.047 --> 14:09.549
I'M FEELING LUCKIER.
THANKS, EM.

14:09.582 --> 14:13.653
Female Vocalist:
 * GIRL, I DON'T
 WANT YOUR BOYFRIEND *

14:13.686 --> 14:16.589
THEY... LOVE YOU.
I KNEW THEY WOULD.

14:23.296 --> 14:25.899
OKAY, LET'S GO.
YUM!

14:25.933 --> 14:27.134
EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED.

14:27.167 --> 14:28.435
Zoey:
IT'S REALLY GOOD.

14:28.468 --> 14:30.971
( cellphone plinks )

14:32.339 --> 14:34.307
Samara: AH,
DID YOU START WITHOUT ME?

14:34.341 --> 14:36.209
( indistinct conversation )

14:39.646 --> 14:42.215
( women giggling )

14:42.249 --> 14:44.184
Bianca: YOU KNOW
I LIKE THEIR FROSTING.

14:50.390 --> 14:52.625
WHAT DO YOU MEAN IT WAS
BURIED IN THE BACK YARD?

14:52.659 --> 14:54.995
TOBY FOUND IT
AND GAVE IT TO DAD.

14:55.028 --> 14:57.430
W-WHERE IS YOUR
HOCKEY STICK NOW?

14:57.464 --> 15:01.234
DAD BURNED IT,
IN THE FIREPLACE.
IT'S GONE.

15:03.971 --> 15:06.473
MOM, WHY ARE YOU
UPSET BY THIS?

15:06.506 --> 15:08.541
I'M SURE HE HAD
A GOOD REASON
FOR DOING IT.

15:08.575 --> 15:11.144
LIKE WHAT?
LIKE HE
PROBABLY GOT SCARED!

15:11.178 --> 15:12.712
AFTER ALL THAT
WE'VE GONE THROUGH,

15:12.745 --> 15:14.514
I THINK THAT
THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE.

15:14.547 --> 15:17.650
SCARED OF WHAT?
YOU THINK THIS HAD
SOMETHING TO DO WITH ALI?

15:17.684 --> 15:19.286
I-I DON'T KNOW.

15:19.319 --> 15:20.687
BUT IF I FOUND
A STICK IN THE YARD,

15:20.720 --> 15:22.489
I WOULD HAVE PROBABLY
BURNED IT TOO.

15:22.522 --> 15:24.424
I... ( sighs )

15:24.457 --> 15:27.160
I'M GUESSING HE ASSUMED
IAN PLANTED IT THERE.

15:27.194 --> 15:29.462
WE ALL KNOW THAT IAN
WAS TRYING TO FRAME YOU.

15:29.496 --> 15:33.733
WHAT IF IT WASN'T
IAN THAT WAS TRYING
TO FRAME ME?

15:33.766 --> 15:35.468
OF COURSE IT WAS IAN.

15:35.502 --> 15:38.438
HE CONFESSED.
HE'S DEAD. CASE CLOSED.

15:41.108 --> 15:43.210
SWEETIE, CAN YOU FINISH
MAKING THE SALAD?

15:43.243 --> 15:45.078
I THINK I LEFT
MY PHONE IN THE CAR.

15:45.112 --> 15:48.548
MOM, WHY IS DAD SO UPSET
THAT JASON'S BACK?

15:48.581 --> 15:52.219
ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW
IS THAT THE DiLAURENTIS FAMILY
IS NOT TO BE TRUSTED,

15:52.252 --> 15:54.454
JASON INCLUDED.

16:05.165 --> 16:07.567
YOU THINK THAT "A"
WAS OUTSIDE?

16:07.600 --> 16:09.702
SOMEBODY IS WATCHING US.

16:09.736 --> 16:11.704
I DON'T KNOW HOW,
BUT THEY ARE.

16:11.738 --> 16:13.173
ARIA, WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO DO?

16:13.206 --> 16:14.641
WE CAN'T PLAY CARDS
FOREVER.

16:14.674 --> 16:16.543
EMILY...
 IF THOSE LAB RESULTS
 GET OUT,

16:16.576 --> 16:17.744
I WILL BE PERMANENTLY
 SCREWED.

16:17.777 --> 16:20.147
I WILL NEVER GET
TO SWIM ON A TEAM AGAIN.

16:20.180 --> 16:23.183
YOU'RE PLAYING POKER.
BLUFF.

16:23.216 --> 16:24.751
THAT'S EASY FOR YOU TO SAY.

16:24.784 --> 16:26.719
IT'S NOT YOUR RELATIONSHIP
"A" IS KICKING AROUND.

16:26.753 --> 16:30.357
I... THINK I'VE HAD
A COUPLE OF PRETTY GOOD
KICKS ALONG THE WAY.

16:30.390 --> 16:33.226
I'M SORRY.
YES. OF COURSE YOU HAVE.

16:33.260 --> 16:35.028
THIS IS AWFUL.

16:38.131 --> 16:40.267
HEY... HOW'S YOUR STOMACH?

16:40.300 --> 16:42.669
IT'S THE LEAST
OF MY PROBLEMS.

16:42.702 --> 16:44.671
IF YOU END UP
BACK IN THE HOSPITAL,

16:44.704 --> 16:46.139
THEN "A" REALLY WINS.

16:46.173 --> 16:47.674
Samara: COME ON,
EM, IT'S YOUR TURN!

16:47.707 --> 16:49.509
I-I GOTTA GO.

16:49.542 --> 16:52.379
WELL, CALL ME...
 LATER, TOMORROW,
 WHENEVER. OKAY?

16:52.412 --> 16:54.214
YEAH, I WILL. THANKS.

16:54.247 --> 16:55.448
'BYE.

16:56.849 --> 16:59.252
( door opens )

17:02.622 --> 17:04.191
I DIDN'T THINK
YOU'D STILL BE HERE.

17:04.223 --> 17:06.526
ARE WE PICKING UP
WHERE WE LEFT OFF?

17:06.559 --> 17:08.560
I THOUGHT WE COULD
FINISH OUR TALK.

17:08.595 --> 17:09.729
OKAY.

17:09.762 --> 17:11.131
WHAT'S THIS?

17:11.164 --> 17:14.166
THIS... IS...
A GOURMET SUPPER

17:14.201 --> 17:16.136
FROM THE FINEST
VENDING MACHINES
IN THE BUILDING.

17:16.169 --> 17:17.569
MMM.

17:17.604 --> 17:20.173
"CERTIFIED FRESH
TILL 2015."

17:22.675 --> 17:24.611
WOULD YOU LIKE TO
DECANT THE CREAM SODA?

17:29.249 --> 17:30.550
WHAT?

17:30.583 --> 17:33.753
ARIA, IS...
SOMETHING GOING ON HERE?

17:33.786 --> 17:36.356
I CERTAINLY HOPE SO.

17:36.389 --> 17:39.659
I MEAN, ASIDE FROM
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

17:41.428 --> 17:44.231
I... I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

17:44.264 --> 17:48.468
I'M TALKING ABOUT YOU
BEING SO, UH...

17:49.569 --> 17:50.503
I'M JUST HAPPY!

17:51.604 --> 17:52.772
I AM.
I'M REALLY HAPPY.

17:52.805 --> 17:55.775
I DON'T WANT TO KEEP
THAT TO MYSELF.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.312
CHEERS.

18:02.682 --> 18:04.184
ONE MORE GAME?

18:04.217 --> 18:05.652
THERE ARE
STILL MORE CUPCAKES.

18:05.685 --> 18:07.420
NOT ME.

18:07.454 --> 18:09.456
ONE MORE, AND THEY'LL
BE ABLE TO SEE MY ASS
IN PHILLY.

18:09.489 --> 18:11.458
YEAH. SORRY, EM,
WE GOTTA GO.

18:11.491 --> 18:12.759
MY CURFEW'S 12:30.

18:12.792 --> 18:14.194
Okay.

18:17.630 --> 18:19.832
( cellphone plinks )

18:29.276 --> 18:30.577
UH, ZOE...

18:30.610 --> 18:32.779
YOU FORGOT SOMETHING.

18:32.812 --> 18:34.481
WHAT'S THIS?

18:34.514 --> 18:35.782
MY NUMBER.

18:35.815 --> 18:37.784
OH...

18:37.817 --> 18:40.220
UM... THANKS.

18:55.868 --> 18:58.305
This was so worth the wait.

18:58.338 --> 19:00.573
I wish you could
stay over every night.

19:00.607 --> 19:03.243
Female Vocalist:
 * NOW THAT YOU
 THINK YOU KNOW *

19:05.212 --> 19:06.813
* CAN YOU FEEL IT?

19:08.248 --> 19:09.849
* KILLING YOU?

19:11.784 --> 19:15.188
* YOU WANNA LEARN IT SLOW

19:16.623 --> 19:19.626
* I'LL BE YOUR BACKUP

19:19.659 --> 19:22.229
* IF YOU NEED TO

19:22.262 --> 19:24.364
YOU CAN'T STOP
THINKING ABOUT
ME, CAN YOU?

19:24.397 --> 19:26.733
* WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?
 ( doorbell rings )

19:31.271 --> 19:33.473
( doorbell rings )

19:35.275 --> 19:36.643
I THINK THAT'S HER.

19:36.676 --> 19:38.611
THE CAPTION SAYS
CLAUDIA DAWSON.

19:40.713 --> 19:42.949
WOW. SHE'S REALLY PRETTY.

19:45.852 --> 19:48.288
DOES IT SAY IF
THOSE ARE HER KIDS?

19:48.321 --> 19:52.625
YEP. JAMES IS ON THE LEFT
AND CLAY IS ON THE RIGHT.

19:52.659 --> 19:54.627
THEY LOOK HAPPY.

19:54.661 --> 19:56.563
HEY, LOOKS
CAN BE DECEIVING.

19:56.596 --> 19:58.698
THERE ARE PLENTY
OF PICTURES OF ME
SMILING WITH MY DAD,

19:58.731 --> 20:02.802
BUT I WAS JUST BEING
BRIBED WITH TUBS
OF CHUNKY MONKEY.

20:02.835 --> 20:04.271
MONTECITO?

20:04.304 --> 20:06.673
SO SHE'S RICH NOW TOO.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.241
NOT EVERYONE THERE IS.

20:08.275 --> 20:10.910
JUST BECAUSE OPRAH
LIVES THERE.

20:16.349 --> 20:18.951
SO, ARE YOU GONNA
CALL HER?

20:20.653 --> 20:21.821
I'M STARVED.

20:21.854 --> 20:23.790
YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO EAT?

20:29.296 --> 20:30.663
YOU DON'T REALLY
HAVE MUCH FOOD.

20:30.697 --> 20:32.465
CAN WE ORDER
A PIZZA OR SOMETHING?

20:32.499 --> 20:33.800
SURE.

20:33.833 --> 20:35.535
UH... CHEESE
OR PEPPERONI?

20:35.568 --> 20:37.670
WHATEVER.

20:37.704 --> 20:39.606
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M JUST GONNA
PICK IT UP.

20:46.713 --> 20:48.715
QUINN TOLD SAMARA
WHAT SHE SAW.
I KNOW IT.

20:48.748 --> 20:50.383
WHAT COULD SHE
HAVE TOLD HER?

20:50.417 --> 20:52.585
I MUST HAVE LOOKED
LIKE I WAS GIVING
ZOE MY NUMBER.

20:52.619 --> 20:55.555
EM, YOU WERE GIVING
ZOE YOUR NUMBER.

20:56.889 --> 20:58.858
I'M BETTER
BLUFFING AT CARDS.

20:58.891 --> 21:01.761
LOOK, YOU HAVE
TO CALL SAMARA.

21:01.794 --> 21:03.363
SHE'S
CALLED TWICE ALREADY.

21:03.396 --> 21:06.366
I'M AFRAID TO PICK UP.
SO CALL HER BACK.

21:06.399 --> 21:08.635
LOOK, IF QUINN REALLY DID
TELL HER SOMETHING,

21:08.668 --> 21:10.603
YOU'RE ONLY MAKING IT WORSE
BY NOT TALKING TO HER.

21:12.605 --> 21:14.841
I'M SORRY I CAME
OVER SO EARLY.
WERE YOU UP?

21:14.874 --> 21:17.544
OH, I WAS UP!

21:17.577 --> 21:19.946
ANOTHER JASON DREAM?

21:19.979 --> 21:23.683
WHAT I WOULDN'T
GIVE FOR JUST A NICE,
SIMPLE NIGHTMARE,

21:23.716 --> 21:25.885
SOMETHING WITH
A LOT OF SPIDERS.

21:25.918 --> 21:28.821
IT WAS JUST A DREAM.
IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

21:28.855 --> 21:31.057
I'M NOT...
THINKING ABOUT HIM.

21:32.825 --> 21:34.594
WHEN PEOPLE SHOW UP
IN YOUR DREAMS,

21:34.627 --> 21:37.697
IT'S... NOT BECAUSE
THEY WANT SOMETHING
FROM YOU,

21:37.730 --> 21:39.532
BECAUSE YOU WANT
SOMETHING FROM THEM.

21:41.067 --> 21:42.769
I HAVE EZRA.

21:42.802 --> 21:45.037
I DON'T WANT ANYTHING
FROM JASON.

21:49.576 --> 21:51.944
BYRON AND I WILL
TAKE TURNS STAYING WITH HIM,

21:51.978 --> 21:54.547
AND HOPEFULLY WE'LL BE
ABLE TO GET A HANDLE

21:54.581 --> 21:56.483
ON WHAT'S GOING ON.

21:56.516 --> 21:58.751
UH, HE SHOULD BE BACK
THURSDAY,

21:58.785 --> 22:02.389
MAYBE FRIDAY
AT THE LATEST.

22:02.422 --> 22:03.790
OKAY, THANKS, JEAN.

22:03.823 --> 22:06.493
WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

22:06.526 --> 22:09.762
JUST LETTING MIKE'S
GUIDANCE COUNSELOR
KNOW WHAT OUR PLAN IS.

22:09.796 --> 22:12.399
WAIT. OUR PLAN WAS
THAT MIKE WAS GONNA
STAY HOME FROM SCHOOL

22:12.432 --> 22:13.900
FOR ONE DAY.

22:13.933 --> 22:16.035
NOW, DOES HE THINK
HE'S STAYING HOME
NEXT WEEK TOO?

22:16.068 --> 22:18.371
I TOLD HIM IF HE NEEDED
A FEW DAYS THAT...

22:18.405 --> 22:20.573
WHERE IS HE NOW?
HE'S IN HIS ROOM.

22:23.943 --> 22:25.678
BYRON, WAIT...

22:25.712 --> 22:27.980
BEFORE YOU
BARREL IN THERE...

22:28.014 --> 22:29.516
WHY ARE WE INDULGING HIM?

22:29.549 --> 22:31.384
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK
PUNISHING HIM

22:31.418 --> 22:33.386
ANY FURTHER RIGHT NOW
IS THE ANSWER.

22:33.420 --> 22:35.788
OKAY, WE KNOW WHY
HE'S ACTING OUT.

22:35.822 --> 22:37.490
HE MADE THAT
PERFECTLY CLEAR TO ME.

22:37.524 --> 22:39.426
NO, LISTEN. ELLA,
HE DID NOT BREAK
INTO A HOUSE

22:39.459 --> 22:40.760
BECAUSE OF YOU.

22:40.793 --> 22:42.161
OKAY, HE CANNOT
BLAME HIS BEHAVIOR

22:42.194 --> 22:43.730
ON ANYONE BUT HIMSELF.

22:43.763 --> 22:46.032
I'M JUST SAYING,
IF YOU WANT HIM
TO OPEN UP

22:46.065 --> 22:47.834
AND LET US KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON,

22:47.867 --> 22:50.703
ALIENATING HIM
IS PROBABLY NOT
THE BEST APPROACH.

22:50.737 --> 22:54.173
WELL... HE'S GOT TO
GET BACK TO SCHOOL.

22:54.206 --> 22:57.176
I'M NOT SURE HE'S THERE
WHEN HE'S THERE.

22:57.209 --> 23:01.047
I SPOKE TO A FEW
OF HIS TEACHERS,
AND HE'S...

23:01.080 --> 23:03.015
HE'S COMPLETELY
CHECKED OUT.

23:03.049 --> 23:05.985
THEN IT IS OUR JOB
TO GET HIM TO CHECK
BACK IN.

23:19.699 --> 23:21.200
( doorknob rattles )

23:21.233 --> 23:23.970
( knock on door )
Byron: MIKE?
COME ON, OPEN UP.

23:25.805 --> 23:28.207
WHY IS THIS DOOR LOCKED?

23:28.240 --> 23:30.076
( knock on door )

23:30.109 --> 23:31.911
COME ON, OPEN THE DOOR--

23:36.616 --> 23:37.750
YOU SLEEPING?

23:37.784 --> 23:40.487
HM? NO.

23:40.520 --> 23:42.955
ARE YOU NOT FEELING WELL?

23:47.026 --> 23:48.094
MIKE.

23:49.161 --> 23:50.563
MIKE.

23:53.866 --> 23:55.835
I WANT YOU TO COME
DOWNSTAIRS, ALL RIGHT?

23:55.868 --> 23:57.604
YOUR MOTHER AND I WOULD
LIKE TO TALK TO YOU.

23:57.637 --> 23:58.905
ABOUT?

23:58.938 --> 24:00.540
ABOUT EVERYTHING.

24:00.573 --> 24:02.542
ABOUT WHY YOU BROKE
INTO THAT HOUSE.

24:02.575 --> 24:04.076
WHY YOU DON'T WANT
TO GO TO SCHOOL.

24:04.110 --> 24:05.578
WHY YOU'RE
LOCKING YOUR DOOR.

24:06.813 --> 24:09.782
( weakly ) CAN YOU
TURN THAT LIGHT OFF?

24:09.816 --> 24:11.150
IT'S BUGGING ME.

24:17.957 --> 24:18.991
WE'RE--

24:20.560 --> 24:22.929
WE'RE GONNA BE HAVING
DINNER SOON.

24:22.962 --> 24:24.931
I'D LIKE IT IF YOU'D
COME DOWN AND JOIN US.

24:26.098 --> 24:27.500
THE LIGHT?

24:45.284 --> 24:47.620
THIS DOOR,

24:47.654 --> 24:50.156
IT HAS TO STAY UNLOCKED.

24:50.189 --> 24:51.591
YOU KNOW THE RULE.

25:02.935 --> 25:04.170
DO YOU WANT
SOMETHING TO DRINK?

25:04.203 --> 25:05.772
WAS IT BECAUSE
AT THE FASHION SHOW

25:05.805 --> 25:07.173
I TOLD YOU I WASN'T
READY TO BE EXCLUSIVE?

25:07.206 --> 25:08.908
DID YOU JUST DO IT
TO SPITE ME?

25:08.941 --> 25:10.242
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

25:10.276 --> 25:11.744
LOOK, IF YOU WANT
TO DATE OTHER PEOPLE,

25:11.778 --> 25:13.613
JUST SAY, BUT DON'T
HIT ON MY FRIENDS!

25:13.646 --> 25:14.981
I DON'T WANT TO DATE
ANYBODY ELSE, OKAY?

25:15.014 --> 25:16.583
I'M SORRY IF IT
CAME OFF THAT WAY.

25:16.616 --> 25:19.085
CAME OFF THAT WAY?
YOU PRACTICALLY
ASKED ZOE OUT!

25:19.118 --> 25:21.187
I GAVE HER MY NUMBER
SO WE COULD HANG OUT
AS FRIENDS. THAT'S IT.

25:21.220 --> 25:24.190
YOU KNOW, SHE
DIDN'T EVEN TELL ME.
QUINN DID!

25:24.223 --> 25:27.293
LOOK, CAN WE JUST
FORGET THIS HAPPENED
AND GO TO THE MOVIES?

25:27.326 --> 25:29.896
YOU SLIPPED HER YOUR
NUMBER AFTER I LEFT.

25:29.929 --> 25:31.598
WHAT DID YOU EXPECT
ME TO THINK?

25:31.631 --> 25:33.032
I WAS CAUGHT UP
IN THE MOMENT.

25:33.065 --> 25:36.202
THAT WAS...
ME TRYING TO CONNECT
WITH YOUR FRIENDS.

25:36.235 --> 25:40.139
YOU KNOW, UNTIL YOU
GIVE ME A REAL ANSWER,

25:40.172 --> 25:42.074
I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE.

25:47.780 --> 25:48.981
( door closes )

25:56.789 --> 25:58.725
HEY.

25:58.758 --> 26:01.728
YOUR DAD LET ME IN.
HE SAID YOU'D BE
DOWN IN A MINUTE.

26:03.095 --> 26:04.263
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

26:04.296 --> 26:06.666
UH... I WANTED
TO GIVE YOU THIS.

26:09.836 --> 26:11.337
"NICO STAMOS."

26:11.370 --> 26:14.173
CRAMER HILL
YOUTH CENTER?

26:14.206 --> 26:16.909
YEAH, I MET HIM AT
A COUNSELING SEMINAR
EARLIER TODAY.

26:16.943 --> 26:19.078
I FIGURED IF MIKE
WAS OPEN TO IT,

26:19.111 --> 26:22.214
HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP--
WAIT, WHAT DID YOU
TELL HIM ABOUT MIKE?

26:22.248 --> 26:25.351
NOT MUCH. WHY?

26:25.384 --> 26:28.821
I'M-- I'M JUST NOT SURE
THAT MY PARENTS WANT
THE WHOLE WORLD--

26:28.855 --> 26:30.990
I DIDN'T... TELL HIM
ABOUT THE POLICE.
I FIGURED...

26:31.023 --> 26:34.193
UM... THANKS.

26:34.226 --> 26:37.263
I DID TELL HIM THAT
YOU WERE WORRIED
ABOUT HIM, THOUGH.

26:37.296 --> 26:39.231
WORRIED WAS LAST WEEK.

26:45.805 --> 26:47.106
UM...

26:49.175 --> 26:50.743
YOU KNOW WHAT?

26:50.777 --> 26:53.312
I HAVE THIS HUGE HISTORY
TEST TOMORROW, AND I...

26:53.345 --> 26:55.915
TOMORROW'S SUNDAY.

26:55.948 --> 26:58.217
RIGHT.
I MEANT MONDAY.

26:58.250 --> 26:59.819
I'M REALLY BEHIND,

26:59.852 --> 27:02.789
AND MR. BANKS REALLY
PILED IT ON THIS WEEK.

27:02.822 --> 27:05.357
DOESN'T MR. BANKS
TEACH BIOLOGY?

27:05.391 --> 27:07.193
HE DOES.

27:07.226 --> 27:08.795
THAT'S RIGHT.

27:08.828 --> 27:10.162
HAVE A TEST
IN BIOLOGY TOO.

27:10.196 --> 27:12.364
IT'S A BIG
DAY ON MONDAY, SO...

27:12.398 --> 27:14.767
THANKS FOR STOPPING BY.

27:18.270 --> 27:19.672
'BYE.

27:41.794 --> 27:43.095
HEY.

27:43.129 --> 27:45.965
YOU KNOW, YOU ARE
THE WORST DELIVERY GUY

27:45.998 --> 27:48.034
IN THE HISTORY OF PIZZA.

27:49.335 --> 27:51.904
SORRY. I GOT SIDETRACKED.

27:51.938 --> 27:53.139
MIND IF I SIT?

28:05.517 --> 28:07.453
SHE HAD TWO OTHER SONS...

28:09.388 --> 28:12.158
WHILE I WAS LIVING
IN FOSTER HOMES.

28:14.393 --> 28:17.229
WHY DIDN'T SHE COME
GET ME SOONER?

28:17.263 --> 28:21.000
( sighs )
I DON'T KNOW.

28:21.033 --> 28:23.069
BUT MAYBE SHE
WANTS TO MAKE IT UP
TO YOU NOW.

28:23.102 --> 28:25.037
YOU CAN'T MAKE UP
FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

28:26.773 --> 28:28.274
LOOK, I KNOW
THAT YOU'RE ANGRY,

28:28.307 --> 28:30.977
BUT DON'T YOU WANT
TO AT LEAST HEAR HER OUT?

28:31.010 --> 28:34.146
YOU'VE NO IDEA WHAT
WAS GOING ON IN
HER LIFE THEN.

28:34.180 --> 28:36.983
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW.
YES, YOU DO.

28:37.016 --> 28:39.852
CALEB, IT HAS TORTURED
YOU FOR 12 YEARS.

28:42.454 --> 28:44.123
FIND OUT WHAT
REALLY HAPPENED

28:44.156 --> 28:46.092
SO AT THE VERY LEAST
YOU CAN STOP GUESSING.

28:52.231 --> 28:55.467
LOOK, IF YOU CALL HER,
THE WORST THAT CAN HAPPEN

28:55.501 --> 28:57.904
IS THAT YOU NEVER SPEAK
TO HER AGAIN.

28:57.937 --> 28:59.205
THE BEST
THAT COULD HAPPEN

28:59.238 --> 29:02.174
IS THAT YOU ACTUALLY
GET TO KNOW HER.

29:02.208 --> 29:04.877
AND BOTH ARE BETTER
THAN WHAT YOU'RE
DOING RIGHT NOW.

29:28.034 --> 29:29.335
We should be
over there now.

29:29.368 --> 29:33.039
I saw him leave
a half an hour ago.

29:33.072 --> 29:34.540
Em, did you hear me?

29:34.573 --> 29:37.143
Sorry, what?

29:37.176 --> 29:40.212
Look, things aren't over
between you and Samara.

29:40.246 --> 29:42.214
You'll find a way
to explain what happened.

29:42.248 --> 29:44.416
Yeah? How do you
explain "A"?

29:47.053 --> 29:48.420
MOM.
HMM?

29:48.454 --> 29:49.822
YOU SHOULD REALLY
GET GOING.

29:49.856 --> 29:51.557
YOU DON'T WANT
TO HIT RUSH HOUR.

29:51.590 --> 29:53.926
IT'S SATURDAY, HONEY.
THERE WON'T BE ANY
TRAFFIC.

29:53.960 --> 29:55.494
I HEARD THAT THEY WERE
DOING CONSTRUCTION
ON THE BRIDGE.

29:55.527 --> 29:57.229
OH, I WAS JUST ON IT
YESTERDAY.

29:57.263 --> 29:58.464
THERE'S NO WORK
BEING DONE.

30:06.272 --> 30:07.940
MOM, NOW WHAT
ARE YOU DOING?

30:07.974 --> 30:09.441
YOUR SISTER
WANTS ME TO BRING HER

30:09.475 --> 30:11.510
THAT NAVY BURBERRY COAT.

30:11.543 --> 30:13.279
MELISSA'S BACK?

30:13.312 --> 30:15.581
NO, SHE'S
STAYING IN PHILLY
AT HER CONDO.

30:15.614 --> 30:18.184
IT'S BETTER FOR HER TO BE
AWAY FROM ROSEWOOD RIGHT NOW.

30:18.217 --> 30:19.886
HONEY, DO YOU HAVE
ANY IDEA WHERE SHE LEFT IT?

30:19.919 --> 30:21.888
IT COULD BE ANYWHERE,
BUT I'LL FIND IT,

30:21.921 --> 30:23.489
AND YOU CAN GIVE IT
TO HER NEXT WEEK.

30:23.522 --> 30:27.026
YOU SEEM TENSE.
EVERYTHING OKAY?

30:27.059 --> 30:29.061
YEAH. NO,
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

30:29.095 --> 30:31.297
I JUST DON'T WANT YOU
TO BE LATE FOR DINNER.

30:31.330 --> 30:34.166
YOU KNOW HOW
MELISSA GETS WHEN HER
BLOOD PRESSURE DROPS.

30:34.200 --> 30:37.103
MM. ALL RIGHT, GIRLS,
I PROBABLY SHOULD GET GOING.

30:38.337 --> 30:40.172
HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.

30:40.206 --> 30:41.573
I LEFT SOME MONEY
ON THE COUNTER FOR DINNER.

30:41.607 --> 30:43.342
'BYE, MRS. HASTINGS.
'BYE, MOM.

30:43.375 --> 30:44.443
BEHAVE YOURSELVES.

30:45.945 --> 30:47.479
COME ON.
OKAY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

30:47.513 --> 30:49.248
DO WE NEED TO INTRODUCE
YOU TO DECAF?

30:49.281 --> 30:51.117
NO, IT'S TOO LATE FOR THAT.
JUST... COME WITH ME.

30:51.150 --> 30:52.384
WHERE?

30:52.418 --> 30:53.920
TO FIND OUT WHAT
JASON IS HIDING.

31:17.576 --> 31:19.511
HEY.
HEY.

31:21.047 --> 31:23.415
THAT SMELLS GOOD.

31:23.449 --> 31:25.284
I TAKE IT THAT WENT WELL.

31:25.317 --> 31:26.685
NO, IT DIDN'T.

31:26.718 --> 31:29.188
WE DIDN'T TALK.

31:29.221 --> 31:30.957
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WHAT HAPPENED?

31:30.990 --> 31:33.492
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD
BE GIVING MIKE SPACE.

31:33.525 --> 31:36.495
MY PARENTS GAVE SCOTT
SPACE, AND...

31:36.528 --> 31:39.265
WELL, YOU KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM.

31:40.499 --> 31:42.434
WHY ARE YOU
BRINGING UP SCOTT?

31:43.970 --> 31:46.939
BECAUSE WHEN I
WENT UP TO TALK TO MIKE,

31:46.973 --> 31:49.375
HE WAS ROLLED UP
IN A BLANKET.

31:49.408 --> 31:53.545
IT WAS LIKE
I WASN'T EVEN THERE.

31:53.579 --> 31:56.115
AND... I SAW MY BROTHER.

31:58.417 --> 32:01.187
AND WHAT IF THERE'S
SOMETHING MORE
GOING ON HERE?

32:02.688 --> 32:05.024
MIKE IS NOT YOUR BROTHER.

32:07.026 --> 32:08.527
I'LL GET SPOONS.

32:19.471 --> 32:21.273
( sighs )

32:21.307 --> 32:23.275
LOOK, I DON'T TRUST
JASON EITHER,

32:23.309 --> 32:26.045
BUT I'M NOT SO SURE
BREAKING INTO HIS
SHED IS A GOOD IDEA.

32:26.078 --> 32:28.380
IT'S NOT BREAKING IN
IF YOU HAVE A KEY.

32:28.414 --> 32:30.249
WHAT, ARE YOU
JANE BOND NOW?

32:32.384 --> 32:34.353
JASON BLACKED OUT
THE WINDOWS ON HIS SHED.

32:34.386 --> 32:36.355
AREN'T YOU THE LEAST BIT
CURIOUS WHY?

32:36.388 --> 32:38.224
WE'LL BE IN AND OUT
IN FIVE MINUTES.

32:38.257 --> 32:39.458
JUST... TRUST ME.

32:48.267 --> 32:49.635
( clatter )
( Spencer gasps )

32:49.668 --> 32:51.603
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

32:58.544 --> 33:00.312
KEEP MOVING.

33:07.719 --> 33:09.388
( camera shutter clicks )

33:09.421 --> 33:11.223
WHAT IS THIS PLACE?

33:13.059 --> 33:16.262
UGH! SOMETHING
JUST HIT ME.

33:20.599 --> 33:23.435
( camera shutter clicks )

33:23.469 --> 33:25.704
IT'S JASON'S DARKROOM.

33:31.110 --> 33:33.212
WHOSE FACE IS THIS?

33:33.245 --> 33:35.747
( camera shutter clicks )

33:35.781 --> 33:40.086
OH, MY GOD, IT'S ARIA.
THEY'RE ALL ARIA!

33:40.119 --> 33:42.154
IS THAT WHY JASON'S
BEING SO NICE TO MIKE--

33:42.188 --> 33:43.389
SO HE CAN GET
CLOSE TO HER?

33:45.257 --> 33:46.625
CAN WE JUST GET
OUT OF HERE?

33:46.658 --> 33:48.160
MY GOOSEBUMPS
ARE GETTING GOOSEBUMPS.

33:53.099 --> 33:55.134
JASON'S CAMERA EQUIPMENT.

33:55.167 --> 33:57.136
THIS ISN'T FOR
DEVELOPING PHOTOGRAPHS;

33:57.169 --> 33:59.805
THIS IS SURVEILLANCE
EQUIPMENT!

33:59.838 --> 34:02.241
FOR HIS HOUSE?
FOR SPYING ON PEOPLE.

34:04.476 --> 34:05.844
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

34:05.877 --> 34:07.413
YOU THINK HE'S BEEN
WATCHING US THIS WHOLE TIME?

34:07.446 --> 34:08.847
YOU THINK HE'S--?
( car door closes )

34:08.880 --> 34:09.848
HE'S HOME!

34:09.880 --> 34:11.650
JUST FORGET IT!

34:19.324 --> 34:20.759
SPENCER: Come!

34:37.376 --> 34:39.578
( both sigh )

35:16.348 --> 35:18.317
OH! YOU CHANGED YOUR MIND!

35:18.350 --> 35:20.652
COME ON. THE KATY PERRY
CONCERT'S ABOUT TO START.

35:20.686 --> 35:23.422
( chuckles )
I CAN'T WATCH THAT!

35:23.455 --> 35:26.425
SO... WHAT? YOU CAME HERE
BECAUSE YOU MISSED ME?

35:26.458 --> 35:30.162
ACTUALLY, I CAME BY
TO TELL YOU THAT I
TOOK YOUR ADVICE...

35:33.265 --> 35:35.534
...AND I CALLED MY MOM.

35:35.567 --> 35:36.768
YOU DID?

35:36.802 --> 35:38.670
YEAH.

35:38.704 --> 35:40.539
AND?

35:40.572 --> 35:42.674
WE HAD A REALLY GOOD
CONVERSATION.

35:42.708 --> 35:44.643
WELL,
WHAT'D YOU TALK ABOUT?

35:46.278 --> 35:47.346
EVERYTHING.

35:47.379 --> 35:48.947
AND NOTHING.

35:48.980 --> 35:51.550
WE DIDN'T REALLY GO
INTO THE DETAILS OF
WHY SHE LEFT ME,

35:51.583 --> 35:55.521
BUT... SHE DID APOLOGIZE
FOR TAKING SO LONG
TO FIND ME.

35:58.357 --> 36:01.293
AND THEN SHE SAID
THAT MY...

36:01.327 --> 36:03.329
THAT MY VOICE SOUNDS
JUST LIKE MY FATHER'S.

36:07.599 --> 36:08.767
WOW.

36:09.835 --> 36:11.237
I know.

36:12.704 --> 36:14.940
WHAT ELSE DID SHE SAY?

36:17.776 --> 36:19.478
WELL, SHE REALLY
WANTS TO SEE ME,

36:19.511 --> 36:21.880
AND, UM, WE TALKED
ABOUT HER COMING HERE,

36:21.913 --> 36:27.753
AND, UM, IT JUST...
MADE MORE SENSE
FOR ME TO GO THERE.

36:27.786 --> 36:30.722
WHAT, TO CALIFORNIA?

36:30.756 --> 36:32.724
MM...YEAH.

36:32.758 --> 36:34.760
WHEN?

36:35.894 --> 36:37.763
TONIGHT.

36:39.698 --> 36:40.899
TONIGHT?

36:43.702 --> 36:45.337
AS IN NOW?

36:46.705 --> 36:49.275
I KNOW THAT
IT SEEMS RUSHED,
BUT I JUST...

36:49.308 --> 36:50.809
I'VE WAITED
12 YEARS FOR THIS,

36:50.842 --> 36:52.611
AND, AFTER
TALKING TO HER,

36:52.644 --> 36:54.946
I DON'T WANT TO WAIT
ONE MORE DAY.

36:54.980 --> 36:56.548
NO.

36:56.582 --> 36:58.384
NO, OF COURSE.
I UNDERSTAND.

37:00.552 --> 37:02.854
SO...

37:02.888 --> 37:04.823
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN
FOR US?

37:10.896 --> 37:14.600
WE'RE GONNA TALK
ON THE PHONE, AND...

37:14.633 --> 37:16.735
AND I'LL BE BACK.

37:16.768 --> 37:20.372
I'LL BE BACK
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT.

37:21.773 --> 37:23.342
( chuckles )
YOU SAY THAT NOW,

37:23.375 --> 37:25.311
BUT I'VE SEEN
PICTURES OF MONTECITO.

37:28.414 --> 37:31.883
WELL, I HAVE ONE
VERY GOOD REASON
TO COME BACK.

37:35.554 --> 37:36.655
YOU.

37:39.090 --> 37:41.026
CAN I AT LEAST DRIVE YOU
TO THE AIRPORT?

37:41.059 --> 37:44.663
MOM ACTUALLY ARRANGED
A CAR FOR ME.

37:44.696 --> 37:46.264
IT'S WAITING OUTSIDE.

37:48.400 --> 37:49.601
CRAZY, HUH?

37:51.337 --> 37:52.571
I THINK IT'S GREAT.

38:07.886 --> 38:09.488
I'LL CALL YOU TOMORROW.

38:12.358 --> 38:13.825
Good luck.

38:29.808 --> 38:31.009
I LOVE YOU.

38:37.583 --> 38:38.784
I LOVE YOU TOO.

39:15.186 --> 39:16.855
ARIA.

39:17.989 --> 39:19.591
TAKING A STUDY BREAK?

39:20.726 --> 39:22.894
MORE LIKE A SUGAR BREAK.

39:25.063 --> 39:27.032
SOUNDS LIKE MORE FUN
THAN WHAT I'VE BEEN UP TO.

39:27.065 --> 39:28.500
HAD TO BUY A PADLOCK
FOR MY SHED.

39:28.534 --> 39:29.701
SOMEBODY BROKE IN TODAY.

39:29.735 --> 39:31.437
REALLY?

39:31.470 --> 39:32.871
YEAH.

39:32.904 --> 39:34.773
WELL... IT COULDN'T
HAVE BEEN MIKE. HE...

39:34.806 --> 39:37.476
HASN'T EVEN LEFT HIS
BEDROOM SINCE THURSDAY.

39:37.509 --> 39:38.977
I DIDN'T GO THERE.

39:39.010 --> 39:40.946
LISTEN, I...

39:40.979 --> 39:42.481
I'M GLAD
I BUMPED INTO YOU.

39:42.514 --> 39:43.949
I WAS HOPING
WE COULD TALK.

39:50.021 --> 39:52.458
LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE FRIENDS.

39:52.491 --> 39:53.992
IF THOSE TWO HOOK UP
AND SHE STARTS

39:54.025 --> 39:56.127
ASKING HIM
ABOUT THAT NIGHT,
AND HE REMEMBERS--

39:56.161 --> 39:58.430
HE WON'T.
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

40:00.499 --> 40:02.133
WHAT ARE THEY DOING NOW?

40:02.167 --> 40:04.135
OH, FORGET IT.

40:04.169 --> 40:06.872
SOON I'LL BE ABLE
TO SEE FOR MYSELF.
NOTHING.

40:06.905 --> 40:08.874
NOTHING'S GOING ON.

40:08.907 --> 40:11.977
LET'S JUST GET THE HELL
OUT OF HERE BEFORE
ANYONE SEES US.

40:14.713 --> 40:16.448
HOW DID JASON
GET THOSE PICTURES?

40:16.482 --> 40:18.917
HE TOOK THEM.
IN ARIA'S BEDROOM.
WHILE SHE WAS ASLEEP.

40:18.950 --> 40:21.553
SHE HAS NO IDEA
HOW SICK HE IS.

40:21.587 --> 40:23.054
HANNA'S NOT PICKING UP.

40:23.088 --> 40:25.190
ARIA DIDN'T EITHER.
WELL, TRY HER AGAIN.

40:27.759 --> 40:29.895
LOOK, I HOPE I DIDN'T

40:29.928 --> 40:32.097
STEP OUT OF BOUNDS
EARLIER. I REALLY WAS
TRYING TO HELP.

40:32.130 --> 40:33.665
NO, YOU DIDN'T.

40:35.734 --> 40:38.970
I JUST HAVE A LOT
GOING ON RIGHT NOW.

40:39.004 --> 40:40.739
SO.
( cellphone vibrates )

40:40.772 --> 40:43.842
THE TRUTH IS,
I DO CARE ABOUT
YOUR BROTHER, BUT...

40:43.875 --> 40:46.077
I ALSO CARE ABOUT YOU.

40:46.111 --> 40:47.879
AND...

40:47.913 --> 40:49.481
I WANTED TO TELL YOU
IN THE OFF CHANCE

40:49.515 --> 40:51.517
THAT YOU MIGHT
FEEL THE SAME WAY.

41:06.665 --> 41:08.600
I CAN'T DO THIS.

41:08.634 --> 41:09.768
WHY NOT?

41:11.169 --> 41:13.104
I'M NOT... AVAILABLE.

41:15.674 --> 41:17.042
I'M SORRY.

41:30.589 --> 41:32.558
( sighs )

41:32.591 --> 41:36.127
( dialing )

41:36.161 --> 41:37.996
Woman: NO ONE
 IS AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW.

41:38.029 --> 41:40.131
PLEASE LEAVE YOUR MESSAGE
 AFTER THE TONE.

41:40.165 --> 41:42.067
( beep )
 DAD, IT'S ME.

41:42.100 --> 41:44.002
UM...

41:44.035 --> 41:46.572
I'M CALLING TO SEE
WHERE I SHOULD GO
FOR THE FITTING.

41:57.115 --> 41:59.651
OKAY, HIS CAR'S
NOT IN THE DRIVEWAY.

41:59.685 --> 42:01.019
I THINK HE'S GONE.

42:01.052 --> 42:02.988
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD
GO BACK IN THERE.

42:03.021 --> 42:04.823
HOW ELSE ARE WE
GONNA CONVINCE ARIA?

42:04.856 --> 42:06.925
OKAY, LET'S JUST GET
THE PICTURES AND GET OUT.

42:11.963 --> 42:13.164
IT'S GONE.

42:14.700 --> 42:16.034
LOOK. IT'S OPEN.

42:21.840 --> 42:23.609
OH, MY GOD.
