♪

00:16.750 --> 00:19.485
This week on <i>elite chef,</i>

00:19.487 --> 00:21.620
<i>We are down</i>
<i>to the final four competitors.</i>

00:21.622 --> 00:23.655
<i>Only one of these chefs</i>

00:23.657 --> 00:25.324
<i>Half a million dollars.</i>

00:25.326 --> 00:27.059
<i>Will it be...</i>

00:27.061 --> 00:31.163
<i>Ray, the firefighter</i>
<i>turned chef?</i>

00:33.700 --> 00:38.470
<i>Curtis, mr. Cordon bleu?</i>

00:38.472 --> 00:41.673
<i>Or cici, the private chef</i>
<i>to the stars?</i>

00:43.643 --> 00:48.480
<i>Or michelle, the talented</i>
<i>hash-slinging single mom?</i>

00:49.816 --> 00:53.786
Chefs, what would you say
is the most indispensable tool

00:53.788 --> 00:55.354
In your kitchen?

00:55.356 --> 00:56.688
That's easy, my knife.

00:56.690 --> 00:58.824
Something even more essential.

00:58.826 --> 00:59.691
My palate.

00:59.693 --> 01:00.626
Very good, michelle.

01:00.628 --> 01:03.162
Today's advantage round

01:03.164 --> 01:04.730
Is a palate test.

01:04.732 --> 01:06.565
Each one of you

01:06.567 --> 01:08.200
Gonna sample
one of these four dishes

01:08.202 --> 01:11.403
And identify
the mystery protein.

01:11.405 --> 01:12.771
First chef to do so

01:12.773 --> 01:15.207
Will win immunity
for the next round.

01:15.209 --> 01:17.676
Chefs.

01:21.714 --> 01:22.781
Give it a try.

01:30.123 --> 01:32.758
Looks like
some herb-crusted meat.

01:36.429 --> 01:38.097
It's not beef or pork.

01:38.099 --> 01:39.398
It's too chewy.

01:39.400 --> 01:41.667
Strong iron flavor.

01:41.669 --> 01:42.734
Is this made
from liver? Maybe lamb?

01:42.736 --> 01:44.236
That's incorrect.

01:44.238 --> 01:46.238
Lots of asian spices.

01:46.240 --> 01:48.774
Reminds me of a fish eye soup

01:48.776 --> 01:50.709
I had in vietnam.

01:50.711 --> 01:52.277
Definitely not a fish eye.

01:53.613 --> 01:55.681
Could be... Pig?

02:05.892 --> 02:07.726
Oh, my god,
is that a contact lens?

02:07.728 --> 02:09.228
It's human!

02:11.798 --> 02:13.832
(camera clicking)

02:13.834 --> 02:15.667
(indistinct radio chatter)

02:15.669 --> 02:16.869
It looks human.

02:16.871 --> 02:18.871
But, uh, I can't
say for sure.

02:18.873 --> 02:20.739
You know, they're down
to the final four.

02:20.741 --> 02:22.808
They must shoot this show,
like, six weeks ahead,

02:22.810 --> 02:24.443
Because I watched last night,

02:24.445 --> 02:25.878
And there were still
ten contestants.

02:25.880 --> 02:27.813
Can you believe michelle
is still in the running?

02:27.815 --> 02:29.214
After she served
that undercooked

02:29.216 --> 02:31.450
Chicken roulade
to the judges last week?

02:31.452 --> 02:33.919
Didn't realize you guys were
such big fans of the show.

02:33.921 --> 02:36.388
Good-looking people
making great-looking food?

02:36.390 --> 02:37.789
We love this show.

02:37.791 --> 02:39.625
Russell: Well, you're gonna
have to find some other show

02:39.627 --> 02:40.926
To watch until
we figure out

02:40.928 --> 02:42.628
This mystery ingredient.

02:42.630 --> 02:45.330
Finlay:
It's not caviar.

02:45.332 --> 02:47.332
Definitely human blood.

02:47.334 --> 02:48.734
Oh, brother.
I got it right!

02:48.736 --> 02:49.735
I guessed "human"!

02:49.737 --> 02:50.936
You all heard
me say it.

02:50.938 --> 02:52.938
I win immunity.
Oh, come on. That's crap!

02:52.940 --> 02:53.939
Michelle: We were
all thinking it.

02:53.941 --> 02:54.940
You just said it first.

02:54.942 --> 02:56.408
Nobody wins this round.

02:56.410 --> 02:58.744
The mystery protein
was supposed to be

02:58.746 --> 02:59.778
Kangaroo.
Ray:
It doesn't matter.

02:59.780 --> 03:01.213
I got it right.
I win.

03:01.215 --> 03:02.214
Russell:
Ray?

03:02.216 --> 03:03.615
Is that your name? Ray?

03:03.617 --> 03:04.850
Yeah.

03:04.852 --> 03:06.852
What made you think
it was human?

03:06.854 --> 03:09.688
Last time I checked,
animals don't wear contacts.

03:09.690 --> 03:13.325
It was a little bit odd
that a show would

03:13.327 --> 03:15.494
Cook and serve up a human being?

03:15.496 --> 03:17.496
Mm-mm. That wouldn't be
the weirdest thing to happen

03:17.498 --> 03:18.497
On a reality show.

03:18.499 --> 03:20.332
Wolfgang puck:
This is an elite

03:20.334 --> 03:22.701
Culinary competition,
not    <i>fear factor.</i>

03:22.703 --> 03:24.403
Somebody must
have sabotaged

03:24.405 --> 03:25.671
These dishes.

03:25.673 --> 03:27.506
Russell:
Maybe they swapped the meat

03:27.508 --> 03:29.241
To give themselves an edge up.

03:29.243 --> 03:30.409
What do you think, ray?

03:30.411 --> 03:33.245
They don't exactly sell
human body parts

03:33.247 --> 03:34.947
At the grocery store.

03:34.949 --> 03:36.882
No, no. There's only two ways
you get a body:

03:36.884 --> 03:38.217
You steal it

03:38.219 --> 03:40.452
Or you kill it.

You know, it's gonna be hard
to I.D. Our victim.

04:20.327 --> 04:22.461
Once flesh has cooked,

04:22.463 --> 04:25.330
The dna becomes denatured.

04:25.332 --> 04:28.667
Yeah. There's no way an
entire body was used to make

04:28.669 --> 04:31.336
These four dishes.

04:31.338 --> 04:33.872
So what happened to the
remains of the remains?

04:33.874 --> 04:35.540
That's what I'd
like to know.

04:35.542 --> 04:36.808
So, who's
in charge here?

04:36.810 --> 04:37.776
Right here, sir.

04:37.778 --> 04:39.878
Oh, there you go.
Uh, ma'am?

04:39.880 --> 04:43.448
Sorry. Could we, uh,
talk to you for a second?

04:44.917 --> 04:47.653
Hi. Executive producer,
nadine bradley.

04:47.655 --> 04:50.822
Because we were right
in the middle of filming.

04:50.824 --> 04:51.823
Ms. Bradley,

04:51.825 --> 04:53.592
You-you called us when you found

04:53.594 --> 04:55.560
Human body parts in your food.

04:55.562 --> 04:57.362
We're gonna need to find out
how that happened.

04:57.364 --> 05:00.565
Yeah, well, we're the highest
rated culinary competition show

05:00.567 --> 05:02.834
On air, so any of our rivals

05:02.836 --> 05:05.337
Could've pulled a stunt like
this to try and sabotage us.

05:05.339 --> 05:06.805
Or an eliminated contestant.

05:06.807 --> 05:08.807
The prize money is just
the beginning.

05:08.809 --> 05:11.910
Your past winners have gone on
to open their own restaurants,

05:11.912 --> 05:13.445
Become celebrity chefs.

05:13.447 --> 05:14.980
A win is worth millions.

05:14.982 --> 05:17.349
I doubt any of them
are involved.

05:17.351 --> 05:18.984
The eliminated contestants
are sequestered

05:18.986 --> 05:20.986
At a nearby hotel--
we don't want viewers

05:20.988 --> 05:22.988
Knowing who's
been kicked off.

05:22.990 --> 05:24.990
We're gonna also need to see
your footage from

05:24.992 --> 05:28.627
We have 13 cameras
on this stage,

05:28.629 --> 05:31.096
Seven in the house set where
the remaining contestants live.

05:31.098 --> 05:32.831
Are they on all the time?
No.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.900
The cameras on the house set
shut down about 10:00.

05:34.902 --> 05:37.836
That's still over 500 hours
of footage.

05:37.838 --> 05:39.905
So, this was a palate test.

05:39.907 --> 05:43.742
The contestants did not
cook the food. Who did?

05:43.744 --> 05:44.943
We have a team
of prep chefs who use

05:44.945 --> 05:46.845
The kitchen set
after-hours.

05:46.847 --> 05:48.513
Clocked out about 9:00
last night.

05:48.515 --> 05:50.015
Went and did an event
at the palermo,

05:50.017 --> 05:51.683
Then came back at 6:00
this morning.

05:51.685 --> 05:53.685
We're still gonna need
to talk to 'em though.

05:53.687 --> 05:55.087
Who had access
to the kitchen last night?

05:55.089 --> 05:57.522
The contestants
and the entire crew.
(phone ringing)

05:57.524 --> 05:59.591
That's legal.
Sorry.

05:59.593 --> 06:00.726
I have to take this.

06:01.861 --> 06:03.829
Cast and crew?

06:03.831 --> 06:06.398
That is over 100 suspects.

06:06.400 --> 06:08.066
Well...

06:08.068 --> 06:10.135
Body was cooked in the kitchen.

06:10.137 --> 06:12.137
Can't believe I just said that.

06:12.139 --> 06:13.972
Start in the kitchen.

06:15.041 --> 06:17.809
♪

06:38.498 --> 06:41.933
I just found human blood
down that drain.

06:41.935 --> 06:44.870
Hmm. Could be the body
was dismembered here.

06:44.872 --> 06:46.438
Can you hand me
that luminol, please?

06:46.440 --> 06:47.873
Sure.

06:47.875 --> 06:49.441
I'll get the lights.

06:49.443 --> 06:51.743
Thanks.

07:00.787 --> 07:02.521
That's a large volume of blood.

07:02.523 --> 07:04.055
Lights, please.

07:04.057 --> 07:05.957
Means we're not looking
at a stolen body.

07:05.959 --> 07:07.692
We're looking at murder.

07:07.694 --> 07:11.062
Well, the prep chefs left
at 9:00, so the murder must have

07:11.064 --> 07:14.699
Happened after that.

07:14.701 --> 07:16.768
You know, these gel mats
can hold an impression

07:16.770 --> 07:18.036
For up to 12 hours.

07:18.038 --> 07:20.439
Very close to
the blood pool.

07:20.441 --> 07:23.175
Maybe we can I.D. The
last person who stepped on it.

07:28.147 --> 07:30.081
Might be our killer.

07:32.018 --> 07:35.620
You've heard how jesus
turned water into wine.

07:35.622 --> 07:38.957
Now watch in amazement
as I turn blood

07:38.959 --> 07:40.225
Into caviar.

07:40.227 --> 07:43.094
You're comparing yourself
to jesus?

07:43.096 --> 07:44.095
Wow.

07:44.097 --> 07:45.997
First, I take the blood

07:45.999 --> 07:48.500
And add it to a mixture of...

07:48.502 --> 07:52.103
Calcium glucocinate
and calcium lactate.

07:52.105 --> 07:54.005
Next, I add xanthan,

07:54.007 --> 07:57.008
A polysaccharide secreted
from the bacterium

07:57.010 --> 08:01.546
Used as a thickening agent
in food and a stabilizing agent

08:01.548 --> 08:03.148
In makeup.

08:03.150 --> 08:05.650
I took chemistry, too.

08:05.652 --> 08:08.553
Hodges: Blend until
thoroughly dissolved.

08:08.555 --> 08:10.155
(chuckles)

08:10.157 --> 08:12.524
I take my handy pipette,

08:12.526 --> 08:14.726
Extract some of
the blood mixture

08:14.728 --> 08:17.128
And drop it into the alginate
one drop at a time.

08:21.501 --> 08:25.003
I will pull the sphere
from the alginate,

08:25.005 --> 08:27.205
Plunge it
into an ice-cold water bath

08:27.207 --> 08:30.775
And...

08:30.777 --> 08:32.711
<i>Buon appetito.</i>

08:32.713 --> 08:35.113
(chuckles)
I'll pass, thanks.

08:35.115 --> 08:38.049
As you can see, molecular
gastronomy requires great skill

08:38.051 --> 08:40.185
And an aptitude for chemistry.

08:40.187 --> 08:42.954
Something not all chefs possess.

08:42.956 --> 08:44.089
Russell:
<i>So we still</i>

08:44.091 --> 08:45.790
Don't have a suspect.
No.

08:45.792 --> 08:47.759
But I have a very good idea
who the victim might be.

08:47.761 --> 08:50.195
Graham deveraux is missing.

08:50.197 --> 08:53.999
One of the founding fathers
of molecular gastronomy.

08:54.001 --> 08:55.300
He has
a michelin-star restaurant

08:55.302 --> 08:57.168
On the strip.

08:57.170 --> 08:58.770
He was the guest judge.

08:58.772 --> 09:00.772
Taped an episode
of   <i>elite che</i>yesterday.

09:00.774 --> 09:03.174
And then this morning,
did not show up for work.

09:03.176 --> 09:05.210
You think he's the one
in the soup?

09:05.212 --> 09:07.078
Well, he did have
a very big confrontation

09:07.080 --> 09:09.314
With the contestant
who was just eliminated.

09:09.316 --> 09:12.050
I wouldn't feed it to my dog.
And I hate my dog.

09:12.052 --> 09:13.318
Wolfgang:
This looks like

09:13.320 --> 09:15.153
A big mess on a plate.

09:15.155 --> 09:17.956
No sense of presentation.
The presentation
was flawed,

09:17.958 --> 09:20.292
But I think that it was seasoned
very well.
But you seem to fail

09:20.294 --> 09:22.694
To appreciate there are
other spices than pepper.

09:22.696 --> 09:24.863
I would call you "chef,"
but that would

09:24.865 --> 09:26.998
Demean the entire profession.
(scoffs)

09:27.000 --> 09:27.966
That guy's just mean.

09:27.968 --> 09:30.001
I think he's being honest.

09:30.003 --> 09:32.137
Wolfgang: Derek, I'm sorry,
but you are not

09:32.139 --> 09:33.872
The elite chef.

09:33.874 --> 09:35.807
I believe you have
some passion for food,

09:35.809 --> 09:39.210
And maybe someday you'll have
your own restaurant.

09:39.212 --> 09:40.745
Where he will probably
kill someone

09:40.747 --> 09:43.014
With salmonella poisoning.

09:43.016 --> 09:44.816
Your cooking is horrific,
mr. Barlow.

09:44.818 --> 09:46.985
Do restaurant patrons
a favor everywhere

09:46.987 --> 09:48.320
And get out
of the food industry.

09:48.322 --> 09:49.254
(bleep)
(grunting)

09:49.256 --> 09:50.322
Call security!

09:50.324 --> 09:51.323
Get him off me!

09:51.325 --> 09:53.091
(bleeping)
(shouting)

09:53.093 --> 09:55.627
You know what? You better
watch your back, deveraux.

09:55.629 --> 09:57.362
Watch your back.
Russell:
Okay.

09:57.364 --> 10:00.765
Derek was such a nice guy
on the show,

10:00.767 --> 10:04.235
Nice guys have
their breaking point.

10:04.237 --> 10:06.237
(beeping)
back a bit more.

10:07.206 --> 10:10.041
Keep it coming.

10:10.043 --> 10:12.177
That's great. Perfect. Thanks.
Lucky you managed

10:12.179 --> 10:14.946
To stop the garbage truck
before it made it to the dump.

10:14.948 --> 10:17.349
All the trash collected from
<i>elite chef</i> this morning

10:17.351 --> 10:19.050
Is still inside.

10:19.052 --> 10:21.653
(whirring)

10:21.655 --> 10:23.922
You talk to the driver?
Yeah, didn't notice
anything suspicious.

10:23.924 --> 10:26.191
With all
that rotting food inside,

10:26.193 --> 10:28.293
Hard to tell if there's a body.

10:31.697 --> 10:33.732
This could take a while.
Well, we only

10:33.734 --> 10:35.066
Have to go through
the green bags,

10:35.068 --> 10:36.901
'cause those are the ones
that the studio uses.

10:48.748 --> 10:49.714
(gags)

10:50.383 --> 10:51.383
Maggots.

10:51.385 --> 10:53.218
I don't even
notice anymore.

10:53.220 --> 10:55.320
(groans)

11:00.826 --> 11:02.293
Got an arm.

11:03.963 --> 11:05.897
Definitely male.

11:05.899 --> 11:07.932
Mr. Deveraux, I presume.
Hard to say.

11:07.934 --> 11:09.701
Henry wasn't able
to extract a dna profile

11:09.703 --> 11:11.803
From the blood found
in the kitchen.

11:11.805 --> 11:13.805
Looks like some of the flesh
has been excised.

11:13.807 --> 11:16.941
Probably used to make
that herb-crusted meat.

11:16.943 --> 11:18.810
(groans)

11:18.812 --> 11:21.146
Let's see if we can
find the rest of him.

11:22.415 --> 11:25.417
Finlay: Those look like
fried mac and cheese balls.

11:27.153 --> 11:29.187
Phillips:
Definitely not mac and cheese.

11:29.189 --> 11:31.022
I think it's something else.

11:31.024 --> 11:32.924
Rocky mountain oysters.

11:32.926 --> 11:35.160
Aren't those fried
bull testicles?

11:35.162 --> 11:36.995
Indeed, they are,
and quite delicious.

11:36.997 --> 11:39.297
It's like a light
chicken nugget.

11:39.299 --> 11:41.366
But they're about three times
bigger than this.

11:42.835 --> 11:45.003
This is an orchidometer.

11:45.005 --> 11:46.971
It measures testicle size.

11:46.973 --> 11:49.140
And these are consistent

11:49.142 --> 11:51.009
With that of an adult human.

11:51.011 --> 11:53.044
Guess the killer didn't want
to waste anything.

11:53.046 --> 11:54.746
Ugh. Gross.

11:54.748 --> 11:57.148
Hey, did you ever hear
about that japanese chef?

11:57.150 --> 11:59.484
He removed his own genitals,

11:59.486 --> 12:01.853
And then served them
at a dinner party

12:01.855 --> 12:04.355
For $250 plate.

12:04.357 --> 12:05.857
Lowballed.

12:05.859 --> 12:07.258
(laughs)

12:07.260 --> 12:08.993
Finlay:
Look at that.

12:08.995 --> 12:10.962
Dark pigmentation
on the chicharone.

12:10.964 --> 12:12.797
Maybe I can reconstitute it.

12:12.799 --> 12:14.866
♪

12:31.150 --> 12:33.384
(beeping)

12:33.386 --> 12:34.953
That's a tattoo.

12:34.955 --> 12:36.454
Finlay:
Where have I seen that before?

12:38.958 --> 12:41.126
I would call you chef,

12:41.128 --> 12:43.528
But that would demean
the entire profession.

12:43.530 --> 12:45.430
Phillips:
That's the tattoo,

12:45.432 --> 12:46.765
But that's not graham deveraux.

12:46.767 --> 12:48.066
No, that's derek barlow.

12:48.068 --> 12:49.534
Who was just eliminated
from the show?

12:49.536 --> 12:51.936
And now eliminated for good.

12:55.374 --> 12:57.375
So, derek barlow
is not our killer.

12:57.377 --> 12:59.477
He's our victim.
Dna just confirmed it.

12:59.479 --> 13:01.279
Okay, where's deveraux?

13:01.281 --> 13:02.947
Still unaccounted for.

13:02.949 --> 13:04.516
Oh. A lot of
killers miss work

13:04.518 --> 13:06.317
The day after
they commit murder.

13:06.319 --> 13:09.521
Anyway, we know that
deveraux had an altercation

13:09.523 --> 13:11.222
With barlow yesterday.

13:11.224 --> 13:13.057
Maybe we have
the right players,

13:13.059 --> 13:15.560
Just in the wrong roles.

13:15.562 --> 13:17.962
You ask me,
they're both scumbags.

13:17.964 --> 13:19.364
Especially derek.

13:19.366 --> 13:21.432
I know, as a producer,
I'm supposed to be impartial,

13:21.434 --> 13:23.434
But that guy was a piece
of work.

13:23.436 --> 13:25.804
He did not appear
that way on the show.

13:25.806 --> 13:27.205
He was a great chef,

13:27.207 --> 13:29.340
And I wanted the audience
to root for him,

13:29.342 --> 13:31.976
So I cut out a lot of the stuff
where he was being an ass.

13:31.978 --> 13:34.345
I can show you
the raw footage.

13:34.347 --> 13:36.181
Sure.

13:40.052 --> 13:42.887
(sizzling)

13:42.889 --> 13:44.055
(plate crashes)

13:44.057 --> 13:45.523
What the hell?!

13:45.525 --> 13:47.892
Why don't you pick up
your mess, sweetheart?

13:47.894 --> 13:49.060
You're such an ass!

13:49.062 --> 13:50.528
(laughs)
(sighs)

13:50.530 --> 13:51.496
Derek:
Mmm!

13:51.498 --> 13:52.997
That is exactly how

13:52.999 --> 13:55.233
I like seeing my ladies
in the kitchen--

13:55.235 --> 13:56.501
On their hands and knees.

13:56.503 --> 13:58.169
Ugh.

13:58.171 --> 13:59.270
That's just the tip
of the iceberg.

13:59.272 --> 14:01.906
He tried to sabotage
all the contestants.

14:01.908 --> 14:03.474
Finlay:
Now this seems personal.

14:03.476 --> 14:06.978
I mean, who would have hated him
enough to want to cook him?

14:06.980 --> 14:10.281
To be honest, I wouldn't
put it past any of them.

14:10.283 --> 14:11.883
Derek tried to sabotage me.

14:11.885 --> 14:13.051
Well, screw him.

14:13.053 --> 14:14.385
(laughing)

14:14.387 --> 14:17.088
I always thought
his cooking was overrated.

14:17.090 --> 14:19.557
He's gone,
and I'm in the final four.

14:19.559 --> 14:23.061
I really think
I can win this thing.

14:23.063 --> 14:25.997
Brody:
Greg and I were able to recover
most of derek barlow.

14:25.999 --> 14:29.133
Robbins:
At least the parts that didn't
make it to the dinner table.

14:29.135 --> 14:30.401
You know, I read somewhere

14:30.403 --> 14:32.403
That the yanomamo
tribe in the amazon

14:32.405 --> 14:34.339
Consume pieces
of their deceased loved ones

14:34.341 --> 14:35.640
As an act of mourning.

14:35.642 --> 14:38.243
A way of keeping them alive
within them.

14:38.245 --> 14:41.112
Well, I don't think that was
the case with mr. Barlow here.

14:41.114 --> 14:42.981
Finlay said everyone hated him.

14:42.983 --> 14:45.149
Yes, but at least
the killer was kind enough

14:45.151 --> 14:47.919
To kill mr. Barlow before
they dismembered and cooked him.

14:47.921 --> 14:51.256
Look at the margins near
the disarticulations.

14:51.258 --> 14:52.957
Skin is blanched.

14:52.959 --> 14:54.325
Orange in color.

14:54.327 --> 14:56.594
Blood wasn't circulating.

14:56.596 --> 14:58.596
May I?

14:58.598 --> 15:00.431
Go ahead.

15:00.433 --> 15:02.533
Looks like he's
had a head injury.

15:02.535 --> 15:05.503
Robbins: Found that examining
underneath his hairline.

15:05.505 --> 15:08.573
Based on the bruising,
at least 48 hours old.

15:08.575 --> 15:10.074
It's unrelated to his death.

15:10.076 --> 15:11.643
So, what's c.O.D.?

15:11.645 --> 15:14.045
Exsanguination due to multiple
sharp force injuries.

15:14.047 --> 15:17.448
Based on the width
and depth of the wounds,

15:17.450 --> 15:20.285
I'd say the killer used
a single-edged knife

15:20.287 --> 15:23.388
With approximately
a seven-inch blade.

15:23.390 --> 15:26.557
Do you think the killer used
the same knife to dismember him?

15:26.559 --> 15:27.926
No, I don't believe so.

15:27.928 --> 15:29.060
Look at the radius

15:29.062 --> 15:30.995
And ulna here--
not a mark on them.

15:30.997 --> 15:32.497
The flesh was removed
with great skill

15:32.499 --> 15:35.066
And with the proper knife.

15:35.068 --> 15:37.302
A boning knife.

15:37.304 --> 15:39.504
Yeah, something any
professional chef would have.

15:39.506 --> 15:42.440
Now, the stabbing, however,
was less precise.

15:42.442 --> 15:44.676
I noted tool marks on the ribs.

15:44.678 --> 15:47.545
(heart beating)

15:47.547 --> 15:49.614
Brody: Well, if we can
microsil the tool marks,

15:49.616 --> 15:52.283
We may be able to
indentify the knife

15:52.285 --> 15:53.518
And our killer.

15:53.520 --> 15:56.487
Rod steward.

15:56.489 --> 15:59.490
I love his music, but what's
he got to do with this?

15:59.492 --> 16:00.658
No, that's rod stewart.

16:00.660 --> 16:02.293
This is rod steward,
with a "d."

16:02.295 --> 16:03.995
He's a designer of
high-end men's shoes.

16:03.997 --> 16:05.363
Very expensive.

16:05.365 --> 16:07.031
His size-ten loafer
matches an impression

16:07.033 --> 16:09.600
On the gel mat that finn
found at the crime scene.

16:09.602 --> 16:11.636
Well, that's interesting,
'cause when I was on the set,

16:11.638 --> 16:14.539
I noticed most of the crew
wearing running shoes.

16:14.541 --> 16:16.407
So did a lot
of the contestants.

16:16.409 --> 16:18.576
Well, up-and-coming chefs
don't make a lot of money.

16:18.578 --> 16:20.378
But celebrity chefs do.

16:20.380 --> 16:23.481
Graham deveraux,
our missing judge.

16:23.483 --> 16:25.383
Not missing anymore.

16:36.662 --> 16:37.996
(groans)

16:37.998 --> 16:41.265
You feeling better?

16:41.267 --> 16:43.568
Oh, just dandy.

16:43.570 --> 16:45.670
Lot of people have been
looking for you.

16:45.672 --> 16:46.637
What can I say?

16:46.639 --> 16:48.373
I'm a popular guy.

16:48.375 --> 16:50.541
You're also the lead suspect
in a homicide investigation.

16:50.543 --> 16:52.377
What are you
talking about?

16:52.379 --> 16:53.644
Derek barlow,

16:53.646 --> 16:56.214
The contestant
who attacked you--

16:56.216 --> 16:58.216
He was murdered last night.

16:58.218 --> 17:00.551
Oh.

17:00.553 --> 17:04.455
Barlow is dead. Huh.

17:04.457 --> 17:05.523
He was stabbed to death

17:05.525 --> 17:06.691
In the <i>elite chef</i> kitchen.

17:08.327 --> 17:10.328
No.

17:10.330 --> 17:12.630
Well, that counts me out.

17:12.632 --> 17:14.799
Judges aren't allowed
in that kitchen.

17:14.801 --> 17:16.467
It's against the rules.

17:16.469 --> 17:18.603
If it's against the rules,
then how do you explain

17:18.605 --> 17:21.639
The fact that we found
an impression of your size ten

17:21.641 --> 17:24.609
Rod steward loafer
in the kitchen of <i>elite chef</i>

17:24.611 --> 17:28.112
Right next to where
derek barlow was murdered?

17:28.114 --> 17:29.814
(grunting)

17:32.217 --> 17:34.218
Because I was there,

17:34.220 --> 17:35.386
But not with barlow.

17:35.388 --> 17:36.621
That hot female

17:36.623 --> 17:38.523
Contestant-- what was her name?

17:38.525 --> 17:40.725
Uh, cici? Yeah.

17:40.727 --> 17:43.694
She was showing me
her secret rub recipe.

17:43.696 --> 17:44.829
What time?
I don't know.

17:44.831 --> 17:47.698
Around 6:00,
after we finished filming.

17:47.700 --> 17:49.467
And after
your little hookup,

17:49.469 --> 17:51.669
You arranged for derek
to meet you in the kitchen

17:51.671 --> 17:54.238
So you could teach him
a little lesson.

17:54.240 --> 17:57.742
Payback for attacking you
on the show.

17:57.744 --> 18:00.611
Derek barlow
wasn't just murdered.

18:00.613 --> 18:05.616
<i>He was carved up, cooked, and</i>
<i>his blood turned into caviar.</i>

18:05.618 --> 18:08.152
Molecular gastronomy--
which also

18:08.154 --> 18:09.654
Happens to be
your area of expertise.

18:09.656 --> 18:13.858
Any idiot can try their hand
at molecular gastronomy

18:13.860 --> 18:16.661
For the bargain price of $59.99.

18:16.663 --> 18:19.263
You just buy a kit online.

18:19.265 --> 18:21.165
Where were you
after 9:00 last night?

18:21.167 --> 18:23.167
Uh, I was in a limo downtown

18:23.169 --> 18:26.237
Doing body shots of tequila
off two lovely young ladies.

18:26.239 --> 18:28.306
You can ask them if
you don't believe me.

18:28.308 --> 18:31.109
Their names were
candy and brown sugar.

18:34.780 --> 18:36.647
So, you have something for me?

18:36.649 --> 18:39.684
I found kratom in derek barlow's
stomach contents.

18:39.686 --> 18:41.686
It's a leafy herb
from thailand.

18:41.688 --> 18:43.654
Makes the ingestor
irritable and on edge.

18:43.656 --> 18:45.690
So, barlow was drugged.

18:45.692 --> 18:48.493
Might explain why he attacked
graham deveraux last night.

18:48.495 --> 18:50.728
In high doses, that
herb can be fatal.

18:50.730 --> 18:53.664
So, what if someone tried
to poison him,

18:53.666 --> 18:55.133
But it didn't work,

18:55.135 --> 18:57.902
So the killer had
to stab him instead?

18:57.904 --> 19:00.304
Plausible theory.
Mm-hmm.

19:00.306 --> 19:03.708
Oh, uh, where are you
and elisabetta registered?

19:03.710 --> 19:06.244
I wanted to make sure that
I got you something you need.

19:06.246 --> 19:07.745
That's very kind of you.

19:07.747 --> 19:10.715
But, honestly,
I have no idea.

19:10.717 --> 19:13.618
Elisabetta is in charge
of all things nuptial.

19:13.620 --> 19:16.154
Really?
All I got to do is get
to the church on time.

19:16.156 --> 19:20.758
I always thought of you as
a detail-oriented kind of guy.

19:20.760 --> 19:22.293
And yet, you're not
even interested

19:22.295 --> 19:24.729
In planning the most
important day of your life?

19:24.731 --> 19:26.831
Well, work keeps me very busy.

19:26.833 --> 19:29.200
Can I give you some advice,

19:29.202 --> 19:32.637
Coming from somebody who's been
down the aisle a couple times?

19:32.639 --> 19:35.773
You should, um...
You should get involved.

19:35.775 --> 19:36.874
You should have an opinion.

19:36.876 --> 19:38.643
You know, band, dj.

19:38.645 --> 19:40.444
Roses, lilies.

19:40.446 --> 19:42.847
I know it may not
seem important,

19:42.849 --> 19:46.184
But if the groom does not
really care about the wedding,

19:46.186 --> 19:49.754
It makes the bride feel like
you don't really care about her.

19:49.756 --> 19:52.657
It's... Symbolic.

20:04.903 --> 20:07.772
Analyzed the tool marks
on barlow's rib cage.

20:07.774 --> 20:10.741
Turns out, he was stabbed
by his own knife.

20:10.743 --> 20:12.743
Guess the, uh, chefs
all have their own

20:12.745 --> 20:13.844
Distinct set of knives.

20:13.846 --> 20:15.446
They're all kept
in the kitchen.

20:15.448 --> 20:18.749
Where anyone in the cast
or crew has access.

20:18.751 --> 20:23.354
Doesn't help us narrow down
our list of suspects at all.

20:23.356 --> 20:25.656
But this might.

20:25.658 --> 20:27.458
Curtis leblanc,
one of the contestants.

20:27.460 --> 20:29.327
But according
to that, he used

20:29.329 --> 20:30.494
To be curtis gant.

20:30.496 --> 20:31.662
It looks like

20:31.664 --> 20:33.531
Mr. Cordon bleu has a record.

20:33.533 --> 20:36.634
Back in 2001,
he served four years

20:36.636 --> 20:38.002
For possession
with intent to sell.

20:38.004 --> 20:39.837
Didn't the show
do a background check?

20:39.839 --> 20:42.373
Well, according to the
producer, just cursory ones.

20:42.375 --> 20:44.609
Mainly to validate
culinary history.

20:44.611 --> 20:47.378
But if curtis lied to the show
about his criminal past,

20:47.380 --> 20:49.947
That would be cause
for elimination.

20:49.949 --> 20:51.649
Maybe barlow found out
about curtis's secret,

20:51.651 --> 20:55.486
Now    <i>th</i>would be motive
for murder.

20:55.488 --> 20:57.922
I perfected my craft in kitchens
all over the world.

20:57.924 --> 20:59.490
It's my time now.

20:59.492 --> 21:01.692
No one's gonna stand in my way.

21:03.962 --> 21:07.632
Russell:
Well, congratulations,
mr. Leblanc.

21:07.634 --> 21:09.800
Word on the street is
you're the odds-on favorite

21:09.802 --> 21:11.402
To win <i>elite chef.</i>

21:12.471 --> 21:13.871
Not bad for an ex-con

21:13.873 --> 21:15.873
Who honed his culinary skills
making vats

21:15.875 --> 21:18.709
Of mystery meat stew
in the federal pen.

21:18.711 --> 21:20.978
Of course, you were
curtis gant back then.

21:23.582 --> 21:25.583
Look, I-I was, um...

21:25.585 --> 21:27.985
I was a new man
when I got out.

21:27.987 --> 21:30.621
A better man, so...
So I changed my name.

21:30.623 --> 21:32.456
Russell: But you
didn't tell the show.

21:32.458 --> 21:34.959
You actually lied
about your criminal past.

21:34.961 --> 21:37.461
And if they had found out,
you would have been kicked off.

21:37.463 --> 21:39.964
You would have lost your shot
at a half a million dollars.

21:39.966 --> 21:42.667
Crawford:
Only one person on the
show knew your secret.

21:42.669 --> 21:44.435
That was your buddy,
derek barlow.

21:44.437 --> 21:46.637
As it turns out,
you guys go way back.

21:46.639 --> 21:50.308
You were frat brothers at
brassard university in florida.

21:50.310 --> 21:52.310
Friends ever since.

21:52.312 --> 21:54.478
Even roommates here on the show.

21:54.480 --> 21:56.981
But, I mean, let's face it.

21:56.983 --> 21:58.649
Half a million dollars--

21:58.651 --> 22:02.653
That could turn even the best
of friends into enemies.

22:02.655 --> 22:03.954
Russell:
What happened?

22:03.956 --> 22:05.856
Barlow threatened
to expose your secret?

22:05.858 --> 22:07.692
Is that why you killed him?

22:09.027 --> 22:12.396
We know that you tried to
poison him earlier in the day.

22:12.398 --> 22:15.032
We found trace amounts
of the herb kratom

22:15.034 --> 22:16.367
In his stomach contents.

22:16.369 --> 22:17.768
You special-ordered it

22:17.770 --> 22:20.971
From thailand two weeks ago,
so give me a break.

22:20.973 --> 22:23.441
But that didn't kill him,
so you lured him

22:23.443 --> 22:26.577
Into the kitchen
and you stabbed him to death.

22:29.381 --> 22:31.015
Curtis:
<i>I didn't kill derek.</i>

22:31.017 --> 22:33.017
<i>I wasn't even in the kitchen</i>
<i>last night.</i>

22:33.019 --> 22:35.419
I didn't stab him and I
wasn't trying to poison him.

22:35.421 --> 22:36.721
I just...

22:36.723 --> 22:40.891
I gave him a little kratom
to-to make him sick,

22:40.893 --> 22:42.893
To throw him
off his game.

22:42.895 --> 22:48.065
Derek was always better
than me... At everything.

22:48.067 --> 22:49.934
Even on the show, he was
winning every challenge.

22:49.936 --> 22:52.770
I... Just needed an edge.

22:52.772 --> 22:56.474
So, after you edged out derek,
where did you go?

22:56.476 --> 22:57.908
Back to our room.

22:57.910 --> 22:58.943
How long did you stay there?

22:58.945 --> 22:59.944
All night.

22:59.946 --> 23:01.779
Drank till I passed out.

23:01.781 --> 23:03.948
Look, I-I wasn't trying
to get derek eliminated.

23:03.950 --> 23:07.051
I just wanted to win.

23:09.521 --> 23:11.756
Nice digs
for a reality show.

23:12.824 --> 23:16.160
So derek barlow
was killed in the kitchen

23:16.162 --> 23:18.162
Sometime between 10:00 and 6:00,

23:18.164 --> 23:19.930
Which means curtis leblanc
could have left

23:19.932 --> 23:22.633
This room anytime
during that window

23:22.635 --> 23:24.402
And the cameras
wouldn't have picked him up.

23:24.404 --> 23:27.738
Barlow was stabbed
multiple times, dismembered.

23:27.740 --> 23:29.673
Must have been a lot of blood.

23:29.675 --> 23:31.709
Killer would have definitely
gotten some on him.

23:31.711 --> 23:34.412
Let's see if leblanc
took some to go.

23:34.414 --> 23:36.013
♪

23:58.537 --> 24:01.439
♪

24:08.046 --> 24:10.514
Morgan, look at this.

24:11.983 --> 24:14.618
A fingerprint in blood.

24:14.620 --> 24:17.621
Looks like it might have
been used as a weapon.

24:17.623 --> 24:19.790
Didn't barlow have a blunt
force trauma to his head?

24:19.792 --> 24:21.158
Two days before he was killed.

24:21.160 --> 24:25.129
Maybe that's when barlow
threatened to go

24:25.131 --> 24:28.032
And tell them
about curtis's prison time.

24:28.034 --> 24:31.535
No, no, no...
Hey, hey.
Finlay:
<i>Then it got physical.</i>

24:31.537 --> 24:33.471
What are you
gonna do, huh?

24:34.539 --> 24:36.040
Brody:
<i>After the fight,</i>

24:36.042 --> 24:38.108
Barlow promises
to keep his mouth shut,

24:38.110 --> 24:40.144
But curtis can't take
the chance,

24:40.146 --> 24:41.512
<i>So two nights later...</i>

24:42.981 --> 24:44.815
(choking)

24:44.817 --> 24:47.084
Leblanc may have cleaned up
the kitchen, but he left

24:47.086 --> 24:48.819
A mess here.

24:48.821 --> 24:50.688
Could send him right
back to prison.

24:55.227 --> 24:57.895
The alarm clock that we found
under curtis leblanc's bed?

24:57.897 --> 25:00.865
Blood on it belonged to
the victim derek barlow.

25:00.867 --> 25:02.233
Was the fingerprint
leblanc's?

25:02.235 --> 25:04.201
No, but it did match another
one of the contestants.

25:04.203 --> 25:07.137
Huh, michelle rowlands.

25:07.139 --> 25:08.806
She's kind of the underdog
on the show.

25:08.808 --> 25:09.807
She's tough.

25:09.809 --> 25:11.742
Tough enough to
commit murder?

25:11.744 --> 25:13.944
I miss my daughter so much.

25:13.946 --> 25:15.779
Losing is not an option.

25:15.781 --> 25:17.081
Michelle, I'm impressed.

25:17.083 --> 25:21.585
To the final four of
an elite culinary competition.

25:21.587 --> 25:23.687
You're a diner chef
from ohio.

25:23.689 --> 25:27.825
I mean, I worked twice as hard
as the guys to get where I am.

25:27.827 --> 25:30.961
The culinary world can be
a bit of a boys club.

25:30.963 --> 25:31.962
(chuckles)

25:31.964 --> 25:33.531
That's an
understatement.

25:33.533 --> 25:35.132
And derek barlow is
their poster boy.

25:36.268 --> 25:39.603
We know that he sabotaged you
more than once.

25:39.605 --> 25:40.738
You must have been
very happy

25:40.740 --> 25:42.273
When derek was kicked off
the show.

25:42.275 --> 25:43.941
He got what he deserved.

25:43.943 --> 25:46.143
In more ways than one.

25:46.145 --> 25:50.281
We found this alarm clock
in curtis and derek's room.

25:50.283 --> 25:53.651
That there is your fingerprint
in derek's blood.

25:53.653 --> 25:55.286
Finlay:
What happened, michelle?

25:55.288 --> 25:58.088
Had you had enough of his abuse?

25:58.090 --> 26:01.325
Decide to get back at him
for how he treated you?

26:01.327 --> 26:03.861
You obviously got
into an altercation with him

26:03.863 --> 26:06.931
In his room,
and two days later he's dead.

26:06.933 --> 26:08.132
I didn't kill him.

26:08.134 --> 26:10.701
Brody: You had
motive, opportunity,

26:10.703 --> 26:12.736
And you certainly had
the skill set

26:12.738 --> 26:15.039
To cut him up
and cook him.

26:15.041 --> 26:16.640
It's premeditated murder.

26:18.843 --> 26:20.678
A cou... A couple
nights ago,

26:20.680 --> 26:22.813
Derek invited
me to his room.

26:22.815 --> 26:24.214
Curtis wasn't there.

26:24.216 --> 26:26.317
He said he wanted
to form an alliance.

26:26.319 --> 26:29.086
He gave me a drink.

26:29.088 --> 26:31.021
Tasted like licorice.

26:31.023 --> 26:34.658
There must have been something
in it, because next thing

26:34.660 --> 26:38.162
I knew, I woke up and...

26:38.164 --> 26:40.164
Derek was on top of me.

26:40.166 --> 26:42.600
<i>His hand around my throat.</i>

26:42.602 --> 26:44.268
No, stop, please, stop!

26:44.270 --> 26:45.769
Shut up.

26:45.771 --> 26:47.338
Michelle:
<i>I couldn't get him off of me,</i>

26:47.340 --> 26:49.306
<i>So I grabbed the alarm clock</i>
<i>and...</i>

26:49.308 --> 26:51.375
(screams)

26:51.377 --> 26:54.645
<i>...Then I got out of there.</i>

26:54.647 --> 26:56.146
Well, how come

26:56.148 --> 26:58.649
You didn't contact the police,
ms. Rowlands?

26:58.651 --> 27:01.885
It was just the two
of us in there.

27:01.887 --> 27:04.154
It would have been
my word against his.

27:04.156 --> 27:06.690
Besides...

27:06.692 --> 27:09.326
A female chef accusing
a male chef of rape?

27:10.996 --> 27:12.663
I would have never
worked again.

27:12.665 --> 27:14.331
You know, I gave up

27:14.333 --> 27:16.333
Everything to be here.

27:16.335 --> 27:19.870
You know, quit my job,
used up my savings.

27:19.872 --> 27:22.006
Weeks away from my daughter.

27:23.041 --> 27:25.809
All of it would have
been for nothing.

27:25.811 --> 27:27.411
(sniffles)

27:27.413 --> 27:30.414
You know, I'm not sorry
derek is dead.

27:31.416 --> 27:34.151
But I didn't kill him.

27:34.153 --> 27:36.353
Sanders:
<i>So, this was shot</i>

27:36.355 --> 27:39.156
Two days before derek barlow
was murdered.

27:39.158 --> 27:40.691
According to
michelle rowlands,

27:40.693 --> 27:43.661
The rape happened
just before 10:00 p.M.

27:43.663 --> 27:46.196
If she's telling
the truth.

27:46.198 --> 27:48.098
Well, there she is.

27:48.100 --> 27:49.733
She looks pretty upset.

27:49.735 --> 27:51.669
I'd believe her.

27:51.671 --> 27:53.904
But this does not clear her
of barlow's murder.

27:53.906 --> 27:56.373
If anything, it gives her
a stronger motive.

27:56.375 --> 27:58.308
Well, she already hated the guy.

27:58.310 --> 27:59.376
This might have pushed her

27:59.378 --> 28:00.844
Over the edge.

28:00.846 --> 28:02.780
Let's look for evidence,
see if we're right.

28:04.983 --> 28:06.717
Whoa, hang on a sec.
Yeah.

28:06.719 --> 28:08.986
That's barlow's roommate
curtis leblanc,

28:08.988 --> 28:11.321
Just minutes after
michelle left the room.

28:11.323 --> 28:13.123
But she said he wasn't
in the room that night.

28:13.125 --> 28:15.292
Michelle was drugged.

28:15.294 --> 28:17.161
Curtis could have raped her
while she was unconscious,

28:17.163 --> 28:19.697
Then been in the bathroom
while derek had his turn.

28:19.699 --> 28:22.166
These guys are worse
than we thought.

28:23.368 --> 28:26.403
So, this one is called
tropical desire.

28:26.405 --> 28:29.273
Yellow butter cake
with meyer lemon curd

28:29.275 --> 28:32.476
And key lime mouse--
mousse.

28:33.445 --> 28:36.880
Hmm... It's tart.

28:36.882 --> 28:39.450
I thought it was
light and refreshing,

28:39.452 --> 28:43.487
Well, I mean, if-if you
like it, then we should go

28:43.489 --> 28:44.488
With that one.

28:44.490 --> 28:46.156
We both need to like it.

28:46.158 --> 28:50.194
The wedding cake is like
il simbolo del nostro amore.

28:50.196 --> 28:52.329
In Italy, when the bride
and the groom

28:52.331 --> 28:55.065
Feed each other cake,
it tells the world that

28:55.067 --> 28:57.000
They will take care
each other forever.

28:57.002 --> 28:59.770
Can't we tell the
world with a flan?

28:59.772 --> 29:02.306
'cause I'm-I'm not
a big cake guy.

29:02.308 --> 29:04.241
Wow, those look amazing.

29:04.243 --> 29:06.143
You want to help
us sample some?

29:06.145 --> 29:08.746
We're trying to
make a decision.

29:08.748 --> 29:11.782
Oh, no, no, that's something
that only you two can choose.

29:11.784 --> 29:15.419
So, elisabetta, is your family
coming over for the wedding?

29:15.421 --> 29:17.287
Of course.

29:17.289 --> 29:19.456
My parents, brothers,

29:19.458 --> 29:21.759
Few of my cousins, <i>la mia nonna.</i>

29:21.761 --> 29:23.127
She has a big family.

29:23.129 --> 29:24.895
Oh, must be hard to be
so far away from them.

29:24.897 --> 29:25.896
Elisabetta:
Ah, yeah.

29:25.898 --> 29:27.531
I miss them so much,

29:27.533 --> 29:30.467
But no, living here--
it's not forever,

29:30.469 --> 29:32.002
Solo temporanea.

29:32.004 --> 29:33.337
Temporary?

29:33.339 --> 29:35.906
Uh, uh, what
do you mean?

29:35.908 --> 29:40.778
Of course we will have babies
and we move back to Italy.

29:40.780 --> 29:43.781
Hodges:
Honey, I-I thought
you liked it here.

29:43.783 --> 29:45.516
Las vegas is
an amazing city,

29:45.518 --> 29:48.118
But it's no place
to raise a family.

29:48.120 --> 29:49.319
Yeah, but listen.

29:49.321 --> 29:51.288
I-I've built a career here.

29:51.290 --> 29:53.223
It's just a job, david.

29:53.225 --> 29:56.794
My father said you can work at
the vineyard with my brothers.

29:56.796 --> 29:57.795
(scoffs)

29:57.797 --> 30:01.098
I'm a highly
trained scientist.

30:01.100 --> 30:02.966
I have helped put serial
killers behind bars,

30:02.968 --> 30:04.968
And y-you want me

30:04.970 --> 30:06.503
To go stomp grapes
for a living?

30:06.505 --> 30:09.173
La dolce vita
is not about work.

30:11.843 --> 30:13.377
I'm sorry, we shouldn't argue
in front of you.

30:13.379 --> 30:18.882
To iron out these details
before they go down the aisle.

30:18.884 --> 30:21.852
I wish I had done that
with my first husband.

30:21.854 --> 30:25.522
It was very romantic--
very much like you two.

30:25.524 --> 30:27.891
Where did you guys meet?

30:27.893 --> 30:30.294
We met
at a forensics seminar.

30:30.296 --> 30:32.596
Ended up ditching,
spent the whole week together,

30:32.598 --> 30:35.866
And then, a month later,
we got engaged.

30:35.868 --> 30:39.303
And then, uh, we got
married and real life

30:39.305 --> 30:41.138
Set in, and...

30:41.140 --> 30:43.140
As much as we loved each other,

30:43.142 --> 30:45.042
We were still very,
very different people

30:45.044 --> 30:48.612
With different goals
and different needs and...

30:50.048 --> 30:51.849
Just wasn't meant to be.

30:51.851 --> 30:52.950
(chuckles softly)

30:54.319 --> 30:58.856
I'm thinking, uh, white
chocolate raspberry symphony.

30:58.858 --> 31:00.924
Anybody else?

31:07.332 --> 31:08.632
I'm sorry to have
to tell you that,

31:08.634 --> 31:10.634
In light
of the ongoing investigation,

31:10.636 --> 31:13.136
Legal has decided
to shut us down

31:13.138 --> 31:14.504
For the remainder
of the season.

31:14.506 --> 31:16.473
I'm sorry,
you have been

31:16.475 --> 31:19.943
An exceptional crew,
and you will all be paid

31:19.945 --> 31:21.411
For the next
two weeks.

31:21.413 --> 31:23.580
In the meantime, uh,
let's strike the sets

31:23.582 --> 31:26.450
And get rid of
all the perishables.

31:26.452 --> 31:27.584
(indistinct chatter)

31:27.586 --> 31:29.653
I'm so sorry.

31:31.189 --> 31:33.290
(woman screams in distance)

31:33.292 --> 31:34.491
Excuse me.

31:34.493 --> 31:36.026
Excuse me, excuse me.

31:36.028 --> 31:38.195
What's going on?

31:38.197 --> 31:40.230
Woman:
Who is it?

31:44.135 --> 31:46.136
Sanders:
Blunt force trauma to the head.

31:46.138 --> 31:50.207
Makes curtis leblanc the second
chef murdered this week.

31:50.209 --> 31:51.909
Killer competition.

31:58.983 --> 32:01.151
(sniffs)

32:01.153 --> 32:02.653
Smells like soda.

32:02.655 --> 32:04.221
There's some trace
in this wound.

32:04.223 --> 32:05.989
Looks like paper.

32:06.958 --> 32:08.525
Maybe from that label.

32:08.527 --> 32:11.929
Blood, bits of flesh.

32:11.931 --> 32:13.697
Yeah, this could be
our murder weapon.

32:13.699 --> 32:15.599
You know,

32:15.601 --> 32:18.702
Russell and I found evidence
that leblanc was in the room

32:18.704 --> 32:20.370
When michelle rowlands
was raped.

32:20.372 --> 32:21.605
Yeah, but she never

32:21.607 --> 32:24.041
Implicated him,
just derek barlow.

32:24.043 --> 32:26.610
Maybe because she wanted
to take care of him herself.

32:29.948 --> 32:31.448
(yells)

32:36.621 --> 32:38.989
Two men involved
with the rape.

32:38.991 --> 32:40.157
Now they're both dead.

32:40.159 --> 32:42.459
Serving up her own justice.

32:47.031 --> 32:49.166
Finlay:
<i>So, I checked vicap.</i>

32:49.168 --> 32:52.269
You know, michelle rowlands'
rape was very well planned.

32:52.271 --> 32:55.272
On a hunch, I entered some
of the details: Two men,

32:55.274 --> 32:58.575
Date rape drug
and a trace of licorice.

32:58.577 --> 33:01.712
Pretty unusual combination.
But then I thought

33:01.714 --> 33:04.648
There has to be other things
that taste like licorice, right?

33:04.650 --> 33:06.083
Like-like fennel.

33:06.085 --> 33:07.050
Ouzo.

33:07.052 --> 33:08.118
And anise.

33:08.120 --> 33:10.520
And then... I got this hit.

33:10.522 --> 33:13.056
Unsolved case from
over 15 years ago.

33:13.058 --> 33:15.726
College freshman
named sally lennon

33:15.728 --> 33:17.661
Was raped and murdered

33:17.663 --> 33:20.230
At a brassard university
music festival.

33:20.232 --> 33:23.433
Traces of ghb and anise extract.

33:23.435 --> 33:26.670
Barlow and leblanc went
to the very same college.

33:26.672 --> 33:29.039
And when leblanc was arrested
for drug-dealing,

33:29.041 --> 33:33.043
They found his ghb
in anise extract bottles.

33:33.045 --> 33:36.046
Says here two unidentified
semen donors entered into codis.

33:36.048 --> 33:38.315
Did you run that
against barlow and leblanc?

33:38.317 --> 33:39.783
I did.
And?

33:39.785 --> 33:41.618
They matched.

33:41.620 --> 33:44.521
So these two guys
have raped before.

33:44.523 --> 33:46.723
C.O.D. Was asphyxiation

33:46.725 --> 33:48.458
Due to manual strangulation.

33:48.460 --> 33:51.728
And sally's body was found
scavenged by animals.

33:51.730 --> 33:53.263
Based on this old case,

33:53.265 --> 33:56.400
Michelle rowlands is very lucky
to be alive.

33:56.402 --> 33:58.135
Hey, doc.

33:58.137 --> 34:01.371
Got a c.O.D.
On mr. Leblanc?

34:01.373 --> 34:03.540
Not blunt force trauma.

34:03.542 --> 34:05.776
Take a look at
the esophagus here.

34:05.778 --> 34:07.044
You see this swelling?

34:07.046 --> 34:08.545
It's laryngeal edema.

34:08.547 --> 34:11.681
There's also evidence
of eosinophilia in the lungs.

34:12.517 --> 34:13.817
Anaphylaxis.

34:13.819 --> 34:15.152
According to his
medical records,

34:15.154 --> 34:17.387
He had a severe
almond allergy.

34:17.389 --> 34:21.324
Even trace amounts would've
caused his throat to swell shut,

34:21.326 --> 34:23.160
Resulting in asphyxiation.

34:23.162 --> 34:25.662
But we know that he was hit
in the head with

34:25.664 --> 34:27.064
A frozen leg of lamb.

34:27.066 --> 34:28.698
Maybe, maybe not.

34:28.700 --> 34:31.501
<i>It's possible</i>
<i>that when mr. Leblanc started</i>

34:31.503 --> 34:33.670
<i>Losing consciousness</i>
<i>from the anaphylaxis,</i>

34:33.672 --> 34:36.106
<i>He fell, hitting his head</i>
<i>on the leg of lamb.</i>

34:37.408 --> 34:39.776
He had to have known that he was
deathly allergic to almonds.

34:39.778 --> 34:41.545
How did they get in his system?

34:41.547 --> 34:42.813
I didn't notice
any needle marks

34:42.815 --> 34:44.114
Or almonds in the
stomach contents.

34:44.116 --> 34:45.182
Only soda.

34:47.318 --> 34:50.854
Morgan collected a drinking cup
from the crime scene.

34:54.826 --> 34:56.827
Hey-o.

34:56.829 --> 34:59.096
So, uh, I found
trace amounts

34:59.098 --> 35:02.099
Of amygdalin and benzaldehyde
in the soda.

35:02.101 --> 35:03.667
Brody:
Almond extract.

35:03.669 --> 35:07.137
Every single person on that show
knew about leblanc's allergy,

35:07.139 --> 35:08.505
Including
michelle rowlands.

35:08.507 --> 35:11.141
Greg's analyzing
the cup now.

35:11.143 --> 35:13.143
Maybe he can find out
who tampered with it.

35:13.145 --> 35:14.411
Let's hope.
Yeah.

35:14.413 --> 35:16.179
Thanks.
Mmm.

35:16.181 --> 35:19.116
Hey, um...
Do you have a second?

35:19.118 --> 35:20.884
Of course.

35:20.886 --> 35:23.753
(sighs)

35:23.755 --> 35:26.256
Do you...

35:26.258 --> 35:30.227
Think that I'm making a huge
mistake by marrying elisabetta?

35:31.829 --> 35:33.730
Uh...

35:33.732 --> 35:36.299
I can't tell you what to do.

35:38.536 --> 35:41.138
But I can tell you that,

35:41.140 --> 35:43.673
Whatever you decide,

35:43.675 --> 35:46.476
I'm gonna be here for you.

35:49.347 --> 35:51.148
Uh, um...

35:51.150 --> 35:53.550
I should get back to work.

35:59.924 --> 36:02.559
So, um...

36:02.561 --> 36:05.362
I went to this
wedding last year.

36:05.364 --> 36:08.565
They wrote their own vows,
which was kind of funny.

36:08.567 --> 36:12.302
But the groom...

36:12.304 --> 36:15.639
He said something that just...

36:15.641 --> 36:18.942
Man, it stuck with me.

36:18.944 --> 36:20.944
"never marry the one

36:20.946 --> 36:24.214
"that you think
you can live with.

36:26.184 --> 36:30.220
Marry the one you know
you can't live without."

36:34.759 --> 36:37.227
Sanders:
<i>I figured out the source</i>

36:37.229 --> 36:39.496
Of the almond extract
that killed curtis leblanc.

36:39.498 --> 36:40.931
It wasn't his drink.

36:40.933 --> 36:42.566
It was his straw.

36:42.568 --> 36:44.734
<i>Hidden inside was</i>

36:44.736 --> 36:47.737
<i>A sugar straw laced</i>
<i>with almond extract,</i>

36:47.739 --> 36:51.474
<i>Made precisely to fit</i>
<i>inside curtis leblanc's straw.</i>

36:51.476 --> 36:53.743
He would have never noticed it.

36:53.745 --> 36:57.214
So when he took a sip
of the soda,

36:57.216 --> 36:58.848
It passed
through the sugar straw,

36:58.850 --> 37:01.851
Picking up trace amounts
of almond extract,

37:01.853 --> 37:03.587
Which then entered
into his system.

37:03.589 --> 37:04.988
His throat swelled up.

37:04.990 --> 37:08.325
But here's the thing:
When rolling sugar,

37:08.327 --> 37:09.859
No matter how careful you are,

37:09.861 --> 37:12.996
<i>It's hard not to leave</i>
<i>an impression.</i>

37:12.998 --> 37:15.265
Tell me you got a print.

37:15.267 --> 37:17.000
Better than that, I got a match.

37:17.002 --> 37:19.002
Ms. Bradley,
as a producer, I assumed

37:19.004 --> 37:22.005
You worked your way up the ranks
in television, but...

37:22.007 --> 37:24.975
As it turns out, you're
a classically trained chef.

37:24.977 --> 37:27.911
I took courses at the
culinary institute of america.

37:27.913 --> 37:32.682
All about cooking, you know,
from butchering to baking.

37:32.684 --> 37:35.018
Yeah, I've always been
fascinated with how chefs

37:35.020 --> 37:37.354
Can make almost anything
out of sugar,

37:37.356 --> 37:40.357
From a sculpture
of a fire-breathing dragon

37:40.359 --> 37:43.326
To something as simple
as a straw

37:43.328 --> 37:46.463
Laced with
almond extract.

37:46.465 --> 37:48.298
This is the straw that killed

37:48.300 --> 37:50.367
Curtis leblanc.

37:50.369 --> 37:52.569
And that's your print.
We know you
murdered leblanc.

37:52.571 --> 37:55.472
We're pretty sure you
murdered derek barlow, too.

37:55.474 --> 37:57.941
What we didn't know was why
until we started digging

37:57.943 --> 38:00.810
Into your background and
found out that your maiden name

38:00.812 --> 38:02.812
Was lennon.
Same last name

38:02.814 --> 38:07.550
As a young girl who was raped
and murdered 15 years ago--

38:07.552 --> 38:10.887
Sally lennon,
your little sister.

38:10.889 --> 38:13.890
And the case was never solved.

38:17.361 --> 38:20.297
When they found her, she was
wearing my favorite sweater.

38:20.299 --> 38:22.299
She was always taking my stuff.

38:22.301 --> 38:24.601
It's the only thing
we ever fought about.

38:24.603 --> 38:25.869
(laughs)

38:25.871 --> 38:28.805
The case went cold.

38:28.807 --> 38:30.707
My parents shut down.

38:30.709 --> 38:33.977
They... They couldn't even
mention her name.

38:33.979 --> 38:36.046
Must have helped
that your college buddies,

38:36.048 --> 38:39.015
Derek and curtis,
were there for you.

38:39.017 --> 38:43.353
Crawford: When you found out
what they did to your sister,

38:43.355 --> 38:45.088
You arranged
to get them on the show.

38:45.090 --> 38:47.757
You wanted them
on your turf so that

38:47.759 --> 38:48.958
You could kill them.

38:48.960 --> 38:51.061
No.

38:51.063 --> 38:53.430
I only found out
three days ago.

38:53.432 --> 38:57.367
I was going through raw footage,
and saw michelle coming out

38:57.369 --> 39:00.937
Of derek and curtis's room,
half naked, crying.

39:00.939 --> 39:03.340
She told me about the rape.

39:03.342 --> 39:06.509
She'd been drugged,
tasted anise.

39:07.611 --> 39:09.979
Derek's hand was around
her throat.

39:09.981 --> 39:11.414
Sounded just like

39:11.416 --> 39:14.117
What happened to sally.

39:14.119 --> 39:15.585
So then you confronted derek.

39:15.587 --> 39:18.388
Oh...
You and curtis
raped my sister,

39:18.390 --> 39:19.689
Strangled her, then dumped her

39:19.691 --> 39:21.958
In the woods like
a piece of trash.

39:21.960 --> 39:23.827
Nadine, nadine.
You pretended
to be my friend. You...

39:23.829 --> 39:26.363
You knew how hard it was for me
all these years.
I know, I know.

39:26.365 --> 39:28.098
No, no, no. No!
And the whole time,
it was you!

39:28.100 --> 39:30.700
(grunting)

39:32.837 --> 39:34.404
(gasps)

39:37.108 --> 39:40.110
Crawford: I get why
you wanted derek barlow dead,

39:40.112 --> 39:41.611
But you didn't just kill him.

39:41.613 --> 39:45.148
You carved him up,
you cooked him.

39:45.150 --> 39:48.118
You served him to people.

39:48.120 --> 39:52.021
My sister was ripped apart
and eaten by animals.

39:54.058 --> 39:56.426
My parents couldn't bring
themselves to identify the body,

39:56.428 --> 39:58.428
So I had to do it.

39:58.430 --> 40:02.465
I have had that image in my head
every day for 15 years.

40:04.034 --> 40:07.637
Derek deserved
everything he got.

40:07.639 --> 40:10.507
And you wanted
to do the same thing to curtis,

40:10.509 --> 40:12.609
But there were cops everywhere,

40:12.611 --> 40:15.812
So you had to make his death
look like an accident.

40:15.814 --> 40:18.181
I made them pay
for what they did.

40:20.117 --> 40:23.787
And I finally got
justice for my sister.

40:27.992 --> 40:29.592
(sniffles)

40:36.434 --> 40:39.035
Funny thing about italian ice.

40:39.037 --> 40:43.673
Some scholars believe that
it wasn't invented in Italy.

40:43.675 --> 40:46.743
That it was actually
created in china.

40:46.745 --> 40:48.077
(chuckles)

40:50.047 --> 40:51.448
David...
Elisabetta...

40:51.450 --> 40:52.515
Uh...
Uh, sorry.
You go first.

40:52.517 --> 40:54.184
No, no, you go first.

40:54.186 --> 40:58.588
I've been wanting to talk
to you about something.

40:58.590 --> 41:00.557
And I don't...

41:00.559 --> 41:02.926
Know how to say
this, but, um,

41:02.928 --> 41:05.962
Lately, I... I've
been feeling that...

41:05.964 --> 41:07.964
David, it's okay.

41:07.966 --> 41:10.467
I know.

41:10.469 --> 41:12.869
I've been feeling the same.

41:12.871 --> 41:17.207
You and I--
we're very different people.

41:17.209 --> 41:20.677
We both like different things.

41:20.679 --> 41:24.047
You're not happy here.

41:24.049 --> 41:26.483
You'll not be happy
in Italy, either.

41:26.485 --> 41:29.185
You'll miss your friends,

41:29.187 --> 41:31.888
You'll miss your work.

41:31.890 --> 41:35.592
(sighs) and if we were truly
meant to be together...

41:38.062 --> 41:40.630
...That wouldn't matter.

41:40.632 --> 41:43.600
Unfortunately, it does.

41:47.505 --> 41:50.106
I need to go now.

41:50.108 --> 41:51.541
(sighs)

41:56.514 --> 41:58.781
Yeah.

42:03.621 --> 42:05.755
I will always love you.

42:05.757 --> 42:07.824
<i>Ti amo.</i>

42:18.269 --> 42:20.303
Ciao, david.

42:20.305 --> 42:22.572
I'm sorry.
