WEBVTT

00:00.960 --> 00:02.268
- HEY.
- HEY.

00:02.310 --> 00:03.265
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

00:03.310 --> 00:06.063
- WE COULD, YOU KNOW,
DO THE JOB TOGETHER.

00:06.100 --> 00:09.934
- JUST LIKE WE USED TO.
- EXCEPT THAT I'M THE BOSS.

00:09.970 --> 00:10.629
- [chuckles]

00:10.660 --> 00:13.174
- YOU REALLY MISSED ME, HUH?

00:13.220 --> 00:15.108
- YOU'RE TELLING ME.

00:15.150 --> 00:17.004
- I BEGGED YOU TO TELL ME

00:17.050 --> 00:18.938
IF ANYTHING HAPPENED,
AND YOU SAID...

00:18.980 --> 00:19.969
- I SAID NOTHING.
- NOTHING.

00:20.020 --> 00:21.521
I'M MOVING OUT, JULIA.

00:21.570 --> 00:22.594
- JOEL, PLEASE.

00:22.640 --> 00:24.289
- AND THE KIDS AT SCHOOL
ARE STARTING TO NOTICE

00:24.330 --> 00:27.675
THAT MAX HAS HIS...
DIFFERENCES.

00:27.710 --> 00:29.598
AND HE'S ALL ALONE.

00:31.200 --> 00:33.407
- ANOTHER EXAMPLE
FROM THE STATE TEST OF 2005

00:33.440 --> 00:36.068
WAS A QUESTION ABOUT THE ROLE
OF THE UNION BLOCKADE IN--

00:36.100 --> 00:37.476
YES, MAX?

00:37.520 --> 00:39.272
- THE RAILROADS
WERE ALSO DEVELOPING

00:39.310 --> 00:40.447
AT THE TIME
OF THE UNION BLOCKADE.

00:40.480 --> 00:41.162
- YES, IT WAS.

00:41.210 --> 00:42.791
- THE NORTH HAD APPROXIMATELY

00:42.830 --> 00:44.104
22,000 MILES OF RAILROAD,

00:44.140 --> 00:45.061
WHILE THE SOUTH
ONLY HAD 9,000.

00:45.110 --> 00:47.249
- ALL TRUE.
- THE SOUTH ALSO DIDN'T USE

00:47.280 --> 00:47.962
THE COMMON GAUGE
THAT THE NORTH USED,

00:48.010 --> 00:50.001
WHICH WAS THE 4'8 1/2" GAUGE.

00:50.050 --> 00:50.766
- WE'RE NOT TALKING
ABOUT THE RAILROAD

00:50.800 --> 00:53.428
UNTIL LATER THIS WEEK.
NOW--

00:53.460 --> 00:55.735
- PHOTOGRAPHY WAS ALSO ANOTHER
TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENT

00:55.770 --> 00:56.771
OF THE CIVIL WAR ERA.

00:56.810 --> 00:57.731
IT WAS WAY MORE IMPORTANT
THAN THE COTTON GIN.

00:57.780 --> 01:00.328
- MAX, THAT'S GREAT,
BUT WE'RE DISCUSSING

01:00.370 --> 01:01.462
THE UNION BLOCKADE RIGHT--

01:01.500 --> 01:03.149
- DID YOU KNOW THAT MANY
OF MATHEW BRADY'S

01:03.200 --> 01:05.430
FAMOUS BATI'LEFIELD PHOTOS
WERE ACTUALLY STAGED?

01:05.470 --> 01:07.222
THEY FIGURED THAT OUT
BECAUSE THE SAME DEAD GUYS

01:07.270 --> 01:08.237
KEPT APPEARING
IN EVERY PHOTO.

01:08.270 --> 01:09.612
THERE'S A DEAD GUY OVER HERE,
AND THERE'S

01:09.650 --> 01:10.924
THE SAME DEAD GUY
IN THE OTHER PHOTO.

01:10.960 --> 01:12.268
HE WOULDN'T MOVE.
- MAX.

01:12.310 --> 01:15.370
- LIBRARY?
- GO.

01:21.630 --> 01:25.214
OKAY, LET'S GET BACK
TO THE UNION BLOCKADE.

01:25.250 --> 01:26.865
- DON'T LAUGH
AT MY SURFBOARD DRAWING.

01:26.910 --> 01:28.286
- NO, NO, NO, I LIKE IT.

01:28.320 --> 01:29.947
- I THOUGHT THIS COULD BE COOL
IF WE GET--

01:29.980 --> 01:31.356
WITH A SKY, RATHER.

01:31.400 --> 01:32.844
I MEAN,
IT WOULDN'T BE TOO CLOUDY,

01:32.880 --> 01:34.802
'CAUSE IT'S GONNA BE SUNNY.

01:34.850 --> 01:35.703
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

01:35.750 --> 01:38.127
- HOW DO YOU WANNA SHOOT
THE WHOLE THING?

01:38.160 --> 01:39.263
- WELL, IT'S A LITTLE BIT LOOSE,
YOU KNOW.

01:39.300 --> 01:40.403
WE'VE GO'I'I'A BE
IF WE'RE OUTSIDE,

01:40.440 --> 01:41.884
AND JUST SEE
HOW THE LIGHT IS

01:41.920 --> 01:43.433
AND WE'LL JUST SHOOT IT.

01:43.480 --> 01:44.959
- JUST SHOOT IT.
- YEAH.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.194
- [chuckles]
OKAY.

01:46.240 --> 01:48.162
- YOU DON'T LIKE THAT?
- WELL, YOU'RE THE BOSS.

01:48.210 --> 01:49.518
YOU'RE THE BOSS,
ALL RIGHT?

01:49.550 --> 01:51.029
- SAY IT AGAIN.

01:51.070 --> 01:52.992
IS--IS THIS GONNA BE OKAY,
WORKING--

01:53.040 --> 01:54.007
- YEAH.
- YOU WORKING FOR ME?

01:54.040 --> 01:55.769
- WHY WOULDN'T IT BE OKAY?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

01:55.800 --> 01:58.792
BECAUSE I HAVE, UM,
DECADES OF EXPERIENCE

01:58.840 --> 02:01.115
AND I LOST OUT TO SOMEBODY

02:01.150 --> 02:04.074
WHOSE BIG PLAN
IS TO JUST SHOOT?

02:04.120 --> 02:05.348
- [sighs]

02:05.400 --> 02:06.879
YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN THE LIGHT.

02:06.910 --> 02:09.470
- I HATE TO TELL YOU THIS.
IT'S NOT GONNA WORK.

02:09.500 --> 02:10.432
- OKAY.
- NOT GONNA WORK THIS WAY.

02:10.470 --> 02:12.324
- I WOULD LIKE TO BE
A GOOD TEAM PLAYER,

02:12.370 --> 02:14.531
AND I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW,
WHAT WOULD YOUR IDEA BE?

02:14.580 --> 02:15.649
- HERE'S WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO.
- HOW WOULD YOU DO IT?

02:15.680 --> 02:16.908
- OKAY, 'CAUSE I THOUGHT
ABOUT THIS.

02:16.960 --> 02:18.120
WE CAN GET
WHAT YOU'RE GOING FOR.

02:18.170 --> 02:20.684
WE GET SOME WIDE SHOTS
OF THE BEACH,

02:20.720 --> 02:22.517
COME BACK, WE DO THE REST
IN THE STUDIO.

02:22.550 --> 02:23.539
- I DON'T WANNA DO THE REST
IN THE STUDIO.

02:23.590 --> 02:25.205
WE GO'I'I'A PHOTOSHOP IT.
- YES.

02:25.240 --> 02:26.684
- YOU DON'T EVEN LIKE PHOTOSHOP.
- I DON'T.

02:26.730 --> 02:28.277
PHOTOSHOP IS FAKE
AND ARTIFICIAL,

02:28.320 --> 02:29.275
BUT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING.

02:29.320 --> 02:30.275
WE'RE DOING A BROCHURE.

02:30.320 --> 02:31.582
I'M GONNA SHOW YOU.

02:31.630 --> 02:33.029
YOU'RE VERY LUCKY...
- OH, MY GOD.

02:33.080 --> 02:35.310
- I'M HERE WITH YOU ON THIS,
ALL RIGHT?

02:35.360 --> 02:36.497
- ALL RIGHT, YOU SHOULD BE
ALL SET UP.

02:36.530 --> 02:39.146
LET ME JUST CHECK TO MAKE SURE
YOU'RE GETTING A SIGNAL.

02:39.190 --> 02:40.259
OKAY.

02:40.290 --> 02:41.530
AND IT LOOKS STRONG.

02:41.570 --> 02:42.878
- OH, YEAH, REALLY?
- EXCELLENT.

02:42.920 --> 02:44.319
- OKAY, WELL, THAT'S GOOD.

02:44.370 --> 02:45.564
WE GOT CANCER BEAMS RUNNING
THROUGH US ALL TIMES.

02:45.610 --> 02:47.396
_ OH--
- ALL THROUGH THE AIR.

02:47.440 --> 02:49.886
- IT'S PERFECT LY SAFE.
- HMPH.

02:49.920 --> 02:51.569
- I JUST GOT BACK FROM
A PAINTING WORKSHOP IN ITALY,

02:51.610 --> 02:55.091
AND MY INSTRUCTOR WANTS TO
CONTINUE THE CLASS ONLINE,

02:55.140 --> 02:57.096
SO...
- SOUNDS FUN.

02:57.140 --> 02:58.858
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE
TO CALL YOUR NETWORK?

02:58.900 --> 03:02.063
- HOW ABOUT "CANCER BEAMS"?
- [stammers]

03:02.110 --> 03:04.726
UM, "VILLA CAMILLE."

03:04.770 --> 03:06.965
YES, THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING
TO CALL IT--

03:07.010 --> 03:08.079
VILLA CAMILLE.

03:08.110 --> 03:10.317
- VILLA CAMILLE.

03:10.360 --> 03:11.941
- YOU KNOW, MY SON ACTUALLY DID
GO THROUGH

03:11.980 --> 03:14.323
A FEW I.E.P.s,
AND IT WAS VERY OVERWHELMING.

03:14.360 --> 03:15.179
I SOMETIMES FEEL LIKE THEY'RE...
- KRISTINA.

03:15.220 --> 03:16.630
- PURPOSEFULLY TRYING...
- KRISTINA.

03:16.670 --> 03:18.365
- TO CONFUSE YOU SO THAT--
- HEY, KRISTINA.

03:18.400 --> 03:19.389
- WHAT?
- HANG UP.

03:19.440 --> 03:20.919
- HOLD ON A SECOND.
I KNOW.

03:20.950 --> 03:23.157
I DON'T KNOW HOW OUR SITUATION
CAN HELP YOU,

03:23.200 --> 03:24.713
BUT I DO KNOW
THAT THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM

03:24.750 --> 03:26.297
IS REALLY HARD
TO SORT OF NAVIGATE.

03:26.340 --> 03:27.409
- KRISTINA,
I HAVE AN EMERGENCY!

03:27.440 --> 03:28.407
- OKAY.
- CAN YOU GET OFF

03:28.440 --> 03:29.441
THE PHONE, PLEASE?

03:29.480 --> 03:31.892
- UM, COFFEE?
I'D LOVE TO.

03:31.930 --> 03:33.136
- KRISTINA, OH, MY GOD!

03:33.170 --> 03:34.273
THE BABY'S EATING
THE KITI'Y LITI'ER!

03:34.310 --> 03:35.959
- THAT SOUNDS GREAT.
- I DON'T KNOW HOW TO STOP IT!

03:36.000 --> 03:37.479
- THANK YOU, BYE.
- HELP!

03:37.520 --> 03:38.589
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
THAT WAS SO RUDE.

03:38.630 --> 03:42.009
- BOUNDARIES.
- I HAVE BOUNDARIES.

03:42.040 --> 03:43.484
- YOU HAVE TO SET BOUNDARIES.

03:43.530 --> 03:45.623
- HONEY, THIS POOR WOMAN,
I FELT SO BAD FOR HER.

03:45.670 --> 03:47.149
SHE WOULDN'T HANG UP.
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

03:47.190 --> 03:48.282
LIKE, SHE NEEDS OUR HELP.

03:48.330 --> 03:49.354
- BUT YOU HAVE TO TELL
CAROLINE LEE

03:49.400 --> 03:51.391
TO STOP GIVING OUT
YOUR PHONE NUMBER TO PEOPLE.

03:51.430 --> 03:52.909
- OKAY, WE--
- SHE CAN'T EXPECT YOU

03:52.950 --> 03:55.054
TO SOLVE EVERY LITTLE
WOUNDED BIRD'S PROBLEM.

03:55.090 --> 03:56.569
- WE WERE ONCE
THE WOUNDED BIRD, HONEY.

03:56.610 --> 03:58.293
WE DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT AN I.E.P. WAS.

03:58.340 --> 03:59.295
- I KNOW WE DIDN'T...
- IT'S OVERWHELMING.

03:59.340 --> 04:00.546
- BUT YET WE FIGURED IT OUT.

04:00.580 --> 04:01.569
- WE DID. YOU'RE RIGHT.
WE DID.

04:01.620 --> 04:03.759
- SO I JUST THINK
YOU SHOULD SET SOME LIMITS.

04:03.790 --> 04:04.540
- WELL, I'M JUST GONNA HAVE
COFFEE WITH HER.

04:04.580 --> 04:06.161
- THAT'S HO|\\%IT STARTS.

04:06.210 --> 04:07.234
I'M JUST GONNA HAVE COFFEE.

04:07.280 --> 04:08.349
- THAT'S HO|\\%IT STARTS.

04:08.380 --> 04:09.039
- YEAH.
- YOU'LL SEE.

04:09.070 --> 04:12.107
- OH, I WILL.
WE'LL SEE.

04:12.140 --> 04:13.380
WE'LL SEE.

04:13.420 --> 04:14.341
- WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME
A LITTLE BIT

04:14.390 --> 04:16.665
ABOUT WHY YOU'RE HERE TODAY?

04:16.700 --> 04:18.099
- OKAY.

04:18.150 --> 04:19.902
UM...

04:19.940 --> 04:21.043
- UM...

04:21.080 --> 04:22.217
- ON THE PHONE,

04:22.260 --> 04:23.568
YOU MENTIONED HAVING
SOME TOUGH NEWS

04:23.600 --> 04:25.352
TO BREAK TO YOUR CHILDREN,

04:25.400 --> 04:27.675
UH, SYDNEY AND VICTOR?

04:27.710 --> 04:29.018
9 AND 11?

04:29.060 --> 04:30.129
- RIGHT.
- YEAH.

04:30.160 --> 04:31.570
- YEAH?
- YEAH, UM...

04:31.610 --> 04:33.578
WELL, WE'RE JUST,
YOU KNOW,

04:33.610 --> 04:36.784
WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF--

04:36.820 --> 04:40.301
- I'M MOVING OUT.

04:40.340 --> 04:42.376
AND I JUST--WE WANT
TO FIGURE OUT THE BEST WAY

04:42.420 --> 04:46.345
TO, UM, TELL THAT
TO THE KIDS, YOU KNOW.

04:46.380 --> 04:47.768
MAKE A SMOOTH TRANSITION.

04:47.800 --> 04:51.315
NOT LIKE ANYTHING LIKE THIS
CAN BE SMOOTH.

04:51.360 --> 04:55.069
WE JUST WANT TO FIGURE OUT
THE BEST WAY FOR THEM.

04:55.120 --> 04:56.257
- SURE, OF COURSE.

04:56.290 --> 04:58.429
WELL, IT WOULD HELP ME
GIVE BETTER ADVICE

04:58.470 --> 05:00.119
IF I HAD A BETTER SENSE
OF THE SITUATION.

05:00.160 --> 05:01.422
- RIGHT.

05:01.470 --> 05:02.801
- DO YOU MIND IF I ASK YOU
A FEW QUESTIONS?

05:02.850 --> 05:03.919
- NO.
- NO.

05:03.950 --> 05:05.463
- ARE THE CHILDREN AWARE

05:05.510 --> 05:07.330
OF ANYTHING HAPPENING
AT HOME?

05:07.370 --> 05:09.167
DO THEY KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON?

05:09.200 --> 05:12.613
- UM, YES, THEY--
THEY ARE AWARE OF IT.

05:12.650 --> 05:15.278
UM, MY DAUGHTER, SYDNEY,

05:15.310 --> 05:17.961
ASKED WHY WE'RE FIGHTING
SO MUCH.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.628
- SO WE JUST WANT TO TRY
AND AVOID THAT, YOU KNOW.

05:20.660 --> 05:22.548
WE DON'T WANT TO FIGHT
IN FRONT OF OUR KIDS.

05:22.590 --> 05:24.797
- OKAY, WELL,
THIS IS A TOUGH QUESTION,

05:24.840 --> 05:27.661
BUT HAVE YOU DEFINITELY
DECIDED TO DIVORCE,

05:27.700 --> 05:30.498
OR IS THIS
A TRIAL SEPARATION

05:30.530 --> 05:33.533
WITH THE HOPES
OF RECONCILIATION?

05:34.710 --> 05:36.803
- IT'S A TRIAL SEPARATION

05:36.850 --> 05:39.637
WITH HOPES
OF RECONCILIATION.

05:39.680 --> 05:42.672
UM, I HAVE HOPES
OF RECONCILIATION.

05:47.310 --> 05:50.029
- I...

05:50.070 --> 05:52.379
I-I DON'T KNOW,

05:52.420 --> 05:53.239
UH, RIGHT NOW.

05:53.280 --> 05:54.895
- OKAY.

05:54.940 --> 05:58.410
WELL, UNCERTAINTY IS--
IT'S TOUGH FOR KIDS.

05:58.460 --> 06:00.553
BUT SOMETIMES
THERE'S JUST NO AVOIDING IT.

06:00.600 --> 06:02.249
WHY DON'T WE TALK
ABOUT THE TOOLS WE CAN USE

06:02.290 --> 06:03.973
TO HELP MINIMIZE
THEIR ANXIETY?

06:04.010 --> 06:07.218
OKAY?
- OKAY. SURE.

06:07.260 --> 06:09.706
MAY GOD BLESS
AND KEEP YOU ALWAYS

06:09.740 --> 06:12.538
AND MAY YOUR WISHES
ALL COME TRUE

06:12.570 --> 06:14.674
MAY YOU ALWAYS DO
FOR OTHERS

06:14.710 --> 06:17.292
AND LET OTHERS DO FOR YOU

06:17.340 --> 06:19.672
MAY YOU BUILD A LADDER
TO THE STARS

06:19.720 --> 06:20.994
AND CLIMB ON EVERY RUNG

06:21.030 --> 06:23.851
AND MAY YOU STAY

06:23.900 --> 06:26.721
FOREVER YOUNG

06:26.760 --> 06:29.581
MAY YOU GROW UP
TO BE RIGHTEOUS

06:29.630 --> 06:30.824
MAY YOU GROW UP
TO BE TRUE

06:30.870 --> 06:34.317
MAY YOU ALWAYS KNOW
THE TRUTH

06:34.350 --> 06:36.523
AND SEE THE LIGHTS
SURROUNDING YOU

06:36.560 --> 06:38.835
MAY YOU ALWAYS BE
COURAGEOUS

06:38.880 --> 06:41.144
STAND UPRIGHT
AND BE STRONG

06:41.190 --> 06:43.397
AND MAY YOU STAY

06:43.430 --> 06:45.910
FOREVER YOUNG

06:45.950 --> 06:48.157
MAY YOU STAY

06:48.200 --> 06:50.771
FOREVER YOUNG

06:55.510 --> 06:57.478
- THEY'VE BEEN IN THERE
FOREVER.

06:57.520 --> 06:58.828
I MEAN, THAT CAN'T BE GOOD,
CAN IT?

06:58.860 --> 07:00.441
- LOOK, IT'S JUST A LITTLE,
TINY WATER STAIN

07:00.480 --> 07:01.481
ON THE CEILING.

07:01.520 --> 07:02.509
IT'S GONNA BE FINE.
- NO.

07:02.560 --> 07:04.448
THREE MONTHS AGO,
IT WAS A LITTLE, TINY STAIN.

07:04.490 --> 07:05.309
NOW IT'S AN ENORMOUS STAIN.
- [sighs]

07:05.350 --> 07:06.726
- I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
THE WATER HEATER

07:06.770 --> 07:07.907
WAS EVEN IN THE ATTIC.

07:07.940 --> 07:09.384
DID YOU KNOW THAT?

07:09.420 --> 07:10.933
- I WASN'T POSITIVE
OF ITS LOCATION,

07:10.980 --> 07:12.936
BUT I DID NOT SEE IT
ON THE GROUND FLOOR,

07:12.980 --> 07:15.016
SO, YEAH, I THOUGHT THAT
COULD HAVE BEEN AN OPTION.

07:15.050 --> 07:16.938
- WHEN CAN WE GO INSIDE?
- IN A MINUTE.

07:16.980 --> 07:19.221
THE GUY WILL BE--HE'S GONNA COME
OUT HERE AND CLEAR US.

07:19.260 --> 07:20.739
OH, HERE WE GO.
- HERE HE COMES.

07:20.780 --> 07:23.123
- IT LOOKS LIKE THE GUY
WHO TOOK E.T. AWAY.

07:23.160 --> 07:24.058
- [laughs]
IT'S OKAY.

07:24.090 --> 07:26.399
- WE ALL CLEAR?
- OH, CONGRATULATIONS.

07:26.440 --> 07:27.020
YOU GOT MOLD.

07:27.060 --> 07:29.881
- UGH.
- OH, COME ON.

07:29.930 --> 07:33.548
- [sighs]

07:33.590 --> 07:34.750
- I DIDN'T GIVE US MOLD.

07:34.790 --> 07:37.179
- JUST A LITTLE STAIN, HUH?

07:37.210 --> 07:38.302
- [sniffs]

07:38.350 --> 07:39.135
- YEAH, I'M TELLING YOU
RIGHT NOW,

07:39.180 --> 07:41.580
I DON'T TRUST
ANY OF THOSE GUYS.

07:41.630 --> 07:42.904
THERE'S NOT A SHRED OF MEDICAL
OR SCIENTIFIC PROOF

07:42.940 --> 07:45.556
THAT THIS MOLD HYSTERIA
IS WARRANTED.

07:45.600 --> 07:48.285
- UNCLE ADAM, HI.
- HEY.

07:48.320 --> 07:49.764
- SORRY FOR ALL THIS.

07:49.810 --> 07:50.902
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

07:50.950 --> 07:52.497
YOU GUYS MAKE YOURSELVES
AT HOME.

07:52.540 --> 07:53.529
- OOH, CAN I PLAY THE RECORDS?
- AH, AH, AH.

07:53.570 --> 07:54.946
NO, NO, NO, NO.
YOU GOT HOMEWORK TO DO, SO--

07:54.990 --> 07:57.129
- HEY, GRAB THIS, BUDDY.
- WE'LL BE, YOU KNOW--

07:57.160 --> 07:58.604
- MAKE YOURSELVES AT HOME.
- WON'T BE IN YOUR WAY.

07:59.610 --> 08:01.498
IF DADDY'S GOT
THE GOOD INSURANCE POLICY.

08:01.550 --> 08:02.710
- [chuckles]
- YEAH, LET'S SEE

08:02.750 --> 08:06.516
WHAT KIND OF INSURANCE POLICY
DADDY HAS.

08:06.550 --> 08:07.710
- YOU ALL RIGHT THERE, BUDDY?

08:07.760 --> 08:08.829
- YEAH, I'M TELLING YOU
RIGHT NOW,

08:08.860 --> 08:10.794
THIS WHOLE THING
IS A RACKET.

08:10.830 --> 08:12.934
IT'S UTTER BUNK.
HAVE YOU EVER DEALT WITH THIS?

08:12.970 --> 08:15.768
- YEAH, MOLD IS SERIOUS.
- YEAH, NO KIDDING.

08:15.800 --> 08:16.721
- CAN CAUSE SOME REAL BAD
RESPIRATORY ISSUES.

08:16.770 --> 08:19.170
- WE HAD A SPOT THIS BIG.
THIS BIG, ADAM.

08:19.220 --> 08:21.381
THEY COME IN
IN HAZMAT SUITS

08:21.430 --> 08:22.829
TO CAUSE HYSTERIA
AND PANIC.

08:22.880 --> 08:24.040
THE WHOLE THING'S A RACKET.

08:24.080 --> 08:25.081
- COULD'VE BEEN
THAT BLACK MOLD, MAN.

08:25.120 --> 08:26.803
- THEY TRADE IN FEAR,
AND THE WHOLE THING--

08:26.850 --> 08:30.183
HERE WE GO, HERE WE GO.
OKAY.

08:30.230 --> 08:32.607
WE'RE GOING TO THE RITZ.

08:32.650 --> 08:34.789
WE'RE GOING TO THE R--

08:34.820 --> 08:36.856
HEY, WILL YOU LOOK AT--
- WHAT?

08:36.890 --> 08:39.029
- WILL YOU LOOK
AT THIS SPREADSHEET FOR ME?

08:39.070 --> 08:41.231
- [laughs] DO YOU EVEN KNOW
WHAT A SPREADSHEET IS?

08:41.270 --> 08:42.658
- WOULD YOU LOOK AT THE--

08:42.690 --> 08:44.510
- WHAT?
- HOWDY DOODY,

08:44.550 --> 08:46.689
COULD YOU PLEASE LOOK
AT THIS DOCUMENT

08:46.730 --> 08:48.937
FOR ONE SECOND?
- [whispers] OH...OH.

08:48.970 --> 08:51.450
- OKAY.

08:51.490 --> 08:52.832
- RIGHT THERE?
- YES.

08:52.870 --> 08:54.144
- OKAY, "YOUR POLICY DOES NOT
COVER WATER DAMAGE--"

08:54.180 --> 08:56.182
- YOU DON'T NEED TO YELL IT.
- I'M NOT SHOUTING.

08:56.220 --> 08:58.017
- YOU CAN READ WITH YOUR EYES,
NOT YOUR MOUTH.

08:58.050 --> 08:58.869
- OH, I SEE.
- HERE'S WHAT I'M ASKING.

08:58.910 --> 09:02.084
WE--WE HAD ON THE CEILING

09:02.120 --> 09:03.985
A LITTLE BIT OF WATER,
ALL RIGHT?

09:04.020 --> 09:04.600
BUT I DON'T THINK
IT CONSTITUTES

09:04.640 --> 09:07.677
CONTINUOUS WATER SEEPAGE.

09:07.710 --> 09:09.712
- WELL, HOW LONG WAS IT THERE?

09:09.750 --> 09:11.331
- THREE OR FOUR MONTHS.
- FOUR MONTHS?

09:11.370 --> 09:12.928
INSURANCE COMPANY'S NOT GONNA
LET YOU GET AWAY WITH THAT.

09:12.960 --> 09:14.166
YOU'RE NOT STAYING
AT THE RITZ.

09:14.200 --> 09:15.337
THEY'RE NOT GONNA PUT YOU UP
AT A HOTEL.

09:15.380 --> 09:18.133
YOU'RE GONNA BE STAYING
AT MOM AND DAD'S GUESTHOUSE.

09:18.170 --> 09:19.922
- WE ARE NOT STAYING
AT MOM AND DAD'S GUESTHOUSE.

09:19.970 --> 09:21.244
- IT'S FOUR MONTHS.
- I'D RATHER STAY IN A MINIVAN.

09:21.280 --> 09:23.202
- YOU BETTER CALL THEM AND HAVE
THEM FRESHEN UP THE SHEETS.

09:23.250 --> 09:24.933
- EVERYTHING OKAY?
- WHAT'S WRONG--Y-YEAH.

09:24.970 --> 09:27.837
- YEAH?
- GET READY TO PICK OUT

09:27.870 --> 09:30.566
YOUR ROOM SERVICE ITEMS
FROM THE RITZ.

09:30.600 --> 09:32.044
- YEAH, WELL, CAMILLE...
AND ROOM SERVICE...

09:32.080 --> 09:34.082
- 'CAUSE WE GOT
A PRETTY GOOD POLICY HERE.

09:34.120 --> 09:35.109
- SHOULD BE PRETTY INTERESTING,
YOU IN THE GUESTHOUSE.

09:35.160 --> 09:36.843
THAT'LL BE NICE, HUH?

09:36.880 --> 09:38.154
- WHERE'D THAT--OH.
- [chuckles]

09:40.890 --> 09:43.643
- AND THIS I.E.P. STUFF,
IT'S JUST--

09:43.680 --> 09:44.533
IT'S A DISASTER.

09:44.580 --> 09:45.979
I AM TOTALLY...
- IT'S FRUSTRATING.

09:46.030 --> 09:48.305
- OVERWHELMED.
- IT'S OVERWHELMING.

09:48.340 --> 09:49.819
- YES, ABSOLUTELY.
- DON'T TAKE IT PERSONAL.

09:49.860 --> 09:51.475
IT'S LIKE THEY DO THIS
TO PARENTS ON PURPOSE.

09:51.520 --> 09:53.238
I WENT THROUGH THE SAME THING
WITH MAX.

09:53.280 --> 09:54.417
- UGH.
- IT WAS INSANE.

09:54.450 --> 09:56.486
SO, LISTEN,
BEFORE WE GET INTO--

09:56.520 --> 09:57.657
I JUST--I WANTED
TO LET YOU KNOW

09:57.700 --> 09:59.099
THAT I'M SO HAPPY TO HELP YOU
IN ANY WAY THAT I CAN.

09:59.150 --> 10:00.902
I JUST HAVE SO MUCH...

10:00.940 --> 10:02.384
- OH. RIGHT.
- GOING ON AT THE HOUSE...

10:02.420 --> 10:04.388
RIGHT NOW WITH MY OWN.
- OH, NO, NO, NO, PLEASE.

10:04.430 --> 10:06.569
- THERE'S STUFF THAT'S--
- I'M SURE.

10:06.600 --> 10:07.760
I TOTALLY GET IT.
- YEAH.

10:07.810 --> 10:09.254
- AND I'M JUST
SO GRATEFUL FOR...

10:09.290 --> 10:10.279
- YOU GOT IT.
- ANY HELP.

10:10.330 --> 10:11.399
- SO TELL ME ABOUT KIARA.

10:11.430 --> 10:13.057
HER STUDIES,
WHAT SHE'S DOING--

10:13.090 --> 10:15.638
- OKAY, SHE HAS
AN INCREDIBLE MIND

10:15.680 --> 10:17.739
FOR MATH AND SCIENCE,
AND SCHOOL,

10:17.780 --> 10:19.429
IT'S JUST NOT CHALLENGING HER
AT ALL.

10:19.480 --> 10:20.879
- RIGHT.
- AND I'M SO FRUSTRATED.

10:20.930 --> 10:23.683
YOU KNOW,
THEY HAVE HER IN CLASS

10:23.720 --> 10:25.688
WITH THESE KIDS THAT--

10:25.720 --> 10:26.516
- THEY'RE LOWER FUNCTIONING.
- YES, THEY ARE.

10:26.550 --> 10:27.892
AND SHE DOESN'T FIT THERE
AT ALL.

10:27.930 --> 10:29.443
- AND IT'S FRUSTRATING.
- YES.

10:29.490 --> 10:30.479
- YEP.

10:30.520 --> 10:31.555
- I MEAN, LOOK.

10:31.590 --> 10:33.831
MY KID READS QUANTUM PHYSICS
FOR FUN.

10:33.870 --> 10:37.317
- WOW.
- WHAT SHE'S CAPABLE OF--

10:37.360 --> 10:38.907
THE SCHOOL JUST TREATS HER
LIKE SHE'S A PROBLEM

10:38.940 --> 10:41.807
AND SOMETHING THEY JUST HAVE
TO DEAL WITH.

10:41.840 --> 10:43.011
- RIGHT. UM, OKAY,

10:43.050 --> 10:45.018
SO WHEN IS HER I.E.P.
SCHEDULED FOR?

10:45.050 --> 10:46.984
- TOMORROW.

10:47.020 --> 10:49.602
- TOMORROW, LIKE, TOMORROW--
- YES.

10:49.640 --> 10:50.709
- IT'S OKAY.
DON'T LET IT OVERWHELM YOU.

10:50.750 --> 10:52.365
- I'VE JUST BEEN PARA--
I'VE JUST BEEN PARALYZED.

10:52.410 --> 10:53.638
- IT'S OKAY.
- IT'S SO STUPID.

10:53.680 --> 10:56.126
- IT'S OKAY.
UM, THEN I THINK

10:56.170 --> 10:57.262
WE SHOULD PROBABLY
GET TO WORK.

10:57.310 --> 10:58.163
- YEAH.

10:58.200 --> 11:00.851
- MAYBE GET SOME COFFEE.
- OKAY. I HAVE--

11:00.900 --> 11:03.277
- GOOD MORNING, SAN FRANCISCO.

11:03.310 --> 11:05.870
THIS IS SCOTT GOLS FLYING
OVER THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE,

11:05.900 --> 11:07.697
LOOKING DOWN...
[knock at door]

11:07.730 --> 11:09.072
OVER BEAUTIFUL CLEAR SKIES
IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD

11:09.110 --> 11:10.930
WITH TEMPERATURES
THAT ARE IN THE...

11:10.980 --> 11:12.800
- I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE YOU.

11:12.840 --> 11:14.000
- HI. IT IS.

11:14.050 --> 11:15.210
I'M TOLD THERE'S
A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN

11:15.260 --> 11:16.215
WHO HAS A PACKAGE FOR ME.

11:16.260 --> 11:17.704
- WELL, I DON'T KNOW,
BUT I HAVE ONE.

11:17.740 --> 11:19.287
- [chuckles]

11:19.330 --> 11:20.251
- [clears throat]
- WOW.

11:20.300 --> 11:21.039
WHAT IS ALL THIS?

11:21.090 --> 11:23.229
- OH, UH--
- THIS A SNEAK PEEK

11:23.260 --> 11:26.889
AT THE SURFSPORT'S 2014
ANNUAL REPORT?

11:26.920 --> 11:28.717
- WELL, I'M NOT SURE.

11:28.750 --> 11:29.671
I'M WORKING
ON A COUPLE DIFFERENT THINGS.

11:29.720 --> 11:31.950
THIS WAS A WHOLE BEACH CONCEPT,
AND, UH--

11:32.000 --> 11:33.854
- LOVE IT.
THIS CONCEPT LOOKS AMAZING.

11:33.900 --> 11:36.755
- YEAH?
- SO GOOD. YES.

11:36.790 --> 11:38.030
ALEC'S GONNA BE THRILLED.

11:38.070 --> 11:39.241
- YEAH, THIS WAS
SORT OF AN IDEA

11:39.280 --> 11:40.793
IF WE WERE GONNA DO IT
AT THE BEACH,

11:40.830 --> 11:43.071
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE, UM,

11:43.110 --> 11:45.169
HANK THINKS WE'RE GONNA BE
SAFER IN THE--

11:45.220 --> 11:46.039
IN THE STUDIO.

11:46.080 --> 11:47.729
- WAIT--HANK SAYS?
WHY?

11:47.770 --> 11:49.385
WHAT'S HANK
HAVE TO DO WITH IT?

11:49.430 --> 11:50.738
- WELL, I HIRED HIM
AS MY ASSISTANT, YOU KNOW.

11:50.770 --> 11:52.658
HE'S GOT A LOT
OF EXPERIENCE AND--

11:52.710 --> 11:54.871
- HIRED THE GUY THAT
YOU BEAT OUT FOR THE JOB?

11:54.920 --> 11:55.944
- I HIRED A GUY
I USED TO WORK FOR

11:55.990 --> 11:59.608
BECAUSE HE HAS 20 YEARS
OF EXPERIENCE TO MY 1,

11:59.640 --> 12:01.153
AND HE SAID HE'D HELP ME.
- HMM. ALL RIGHT.

12:01.200 --> 12:01.780
SO HE'S IN CHARGE NOW,
OR HE'S--

12:01.820 --> 12:02.980
- NO, HE'S NOT IN CHARGE.

12:03.030 --> 12:05.089
HE'S NOT IN CHARGE.

12:05.130 --> 12:06.506
IT'S JUST, I DID
THIS WHOLE BEACH CONCEPT,

12:06.550 --> 12:09.064
AND--AND, YOU KNOW,
HE'S WORRIED ABOUT THE WEATHER.

12:09.100 --> 12:11.159
WE CAN'T CONTROL THE LIGHT.
- HMM.

12:11.210 --> 12:12.962
- AND HE FEELS LIKE WE
CAN CAPTURE THE SAME STUFF

12:13.000 --> 12:14.513
IN THE STUDIO, SO--
- SOUNDS PRETTY GOOD.

12:14.560 --> 12:15.652
I GUESS HE KNOWS
WHAT HE'S DOING.

12:15.700 --> 12:16.962
- YEAH.
- MAYBE.

12:17.010 --> 12:18.796
- I MEAN, REALLY,
HE WAS LIKE, "IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

12:18.840 --> 12:20.489
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO SHOOT
AT THE BEACH," SO--

12:20.530 --> 12:21.804
- YOU KNOW,
IT'S ALSO IMPOSSIBLE

12:21.840 --> 12:23.239
TO ERADICATE CHOLERA
IN MUMBAI.

12:23.290 --> 12:24.450
- DID YOU DO THAT?

12:24.500 --> 12:26.354
- NO, BUT IT'S NOT GONNA
KEEP ME FROM TRYING.

12:26.400 --> 12:27.389
[chuckles]

12:27.430 --> 12:28.772
- UGH, LOOK, IT'S--

12:28.810 --> 12:29.947
I HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE,
YOU KNOW,

12:29.990 --> 12:33.153
I'M POTENTIALLY
IN OVER MY HEAD.

12:33.200 --> 12:36.021
- YOU'RE NOT, SARAH.
YOU'RE--YOU'RE...

12:36.060 --> 12:36.879
OUT OF YOUR COMFORT ZONE.

12:36.920 --> 12:38.023
- MM.
- RIGHT?

12:38.060 --> 12:40.233
THERE'S A HUGE DIFFERENCE.

12:40.270 --> 12:42.022
BECAUSE, LOOK,
THE WORK'S RIGHT HERE.

12:42.070 --> 12:44.584
YOU WERE HIRED FOR YOUR VISION,
AND HERE IT IS.

12:44.620 --> 12:46.372
I SEE IT, RIGHT?

12:46.420 --> 12:48.445
IF THEY WANTED HAN K'S WORK,
THEY WOULD'VE HIRED HANK.

12:48.490 --> 12:51.937
- HMM.

12:51.970 --> 12:53.346
[video game music]

12:53.390 --> 12:55.142
- OH, LOOK OUT, THERE'S
SOMETHING IN FRONT OF YOU.

12:55.180 --> 12:57.148

- I KNOW.

13:01.640 --> 13:04.188
- ALL RIGHT.

13:04.230 --> 13:06.778
- HOW LONG HAVE THEY BEEN
PLAYING TOGETHER?

13:06.820 --> 13:07.946
- SINCE THEY GOT HOME
FROM SCHOOL.

13:07.990 --> 13:09.878
- OH, I GOT THE COIN.
- HA-HA!

13:09.920 --> 13:11.228
- YOU GET THE ONES--
GET THE ONES UP THERE, GO.

13:11.270 --> 13:14.398
- YEAH, A YEAR AGO,
THIS WAS...

13:14.440 --> 13:15.646
ALL WE COULD THINK ABOUT.

13:15.690 --> 13:16.884
GETTING THEM TO THIS POINT.

13:16.930 --> 13:18.067
- OH, YOU'RE GONNA GET EATEN.

13:18.100 --> 13:20.034
[laughs]

13:26.730 --> 13:28.834
- MAYBE YOU--

13:28.870 --> 13:32.078
TOMORROW.

13:32.120 --> 13:33.974
- OOH!

13:34.020 --> 13:35.738
OOH! OH, GOSH.

OUTDOORS.

13:47.510 --> 13:50.502

WHILE LIVING IN LE HAVRE,

13:50.550 --> 13:53.132
AND THIS ARTIST ACTUALLY...

13:53.170 --> 13:55.991
- OH, THAT'S NICE, YEAH.

13:56.040 --> 13:57.519
WHAT'S GOING ON?

13:57.560 --> 14:01.485
- I'M IN CLASS.
- OH.

14:01.530 --> 14:02.417
CLASS, HUH?

14:02.460 --> 14:04.109
YOU'RE DRINKING ALONE

14:04.150 --> 14:06.209
WHAT A CLASS.
[chuckles]

14:06.250 --> 14:08.810
- HAVE SOME PROSCIUTTO.

14:18.510 --> 14:20.091
- WELL, IT WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE ITALY,

14:20.130 --> 14:22.405
BUT SHE'S IN FRANCE.

14:22.440 --> 14:25.000
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE FRENCH
IMPRESSIONISTS YESTERDAY,

14:25.030 --> 14:26.065
AND SO SHE JUST HOPPED
ON A TRAIN

14:26.100 --> 14:27.965
AND WENT TO MONET'S GARDEN.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.139
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

14:30.170 --> 14:32.274
- WELL, THAT'S A LONG WAY TO GO
TO A GARDEN.

14:32.310 --> 14:35.347
- YEAH, IT'S PRETTY WONDERFUL.

14:35.390 --> 14:39.486
I FEEL LIKE
I'M BACK IN FIRENZE.

14:39.530 --> 14:41.111
FRANCESCA SAYS
THAT IT'S A GOOD IDEA

14:41.150 --> 14:45.428
TO CREATE
AN ARTISTIC SPACE

14:45.470 --> 14:47.426
AROUND YOU WHEN YOU WORK.

14:47.470 --> 14:49.984
I THINK SHE'S RIGHT.

14:50.020 --> 14:51.123
IT FEELS INCREDIBLE.

14:51.160 --> 14:56.336
[instructor continues
in background]

14:56.440 --> 14:58.123
- HMM.

15:10.180 --> 15:13.217
- GO WORK ON YOUR CAR.

15:24.230 --> 15:27.677
- HEY.
IS THAT YOUR MATH HOMEWORK?

15:27.710 --> 15:28.984
- YEAH.

15:29.030 --> 15:30.019
- YOU'RE NOWHERE NEAR DONE
WITH THAT.

15:30.060 --> 15:31.789
- IT'S OKAY, I CAN FINISH IT
DURING HISTORY.

15:31.820 --> 15:34.197
- MAX, YOU CAN'T DO MATH
HOMEWORK DURING HISTORY CLASS.

15:34.240 --> 15:35.468
- YEAH, I CAN, IF I GET SENT
TO THE LIBRARY,

15:35.520 --> 15:37.203
WHICH THERE'S A 72% CHANCE
THAT I WILL.

15:37.240 --> 15:38.446
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

15:38.480 --> 15:40.107
- WELL, OUT OF THE 29 CLASS DAYS
THIS SEMESTER,

15:40.140 --> 15:43.200
I'VE BEEN SENT TO THE LIBRARY
21 TIMES.

15:43.250 --> 15:44.274
- ALL RIGHT,
HOLD ON A SECOND.

15:44.320 --> 15:45.719
WHO IS SENDING YOU
TO THE LIBRARY?

15:45.770 --> 15:47.169
- MR. WYMAN.
[school bell rings]

15:47.220 --> 15:48.528
- AND WHY IS HE SENDING YOU
TO THE LIBRARY?

15:48.560 --> 15:50.141
- I DON'T KNOW.
THAT WAS THE FIRST BELL.

15:50.190 --> 15:51.418
- MAX, LISTEN,
THERE'S GOTTA BE A REASON

15:51.460 --> 15:52.256
WHY HE'S SENDING YOU
TO THE LIBRARY.

15:52.290 --> 15:54.667
- I DON'T KNOW. BYE, DAD.
_ MAX--

15:54.710 --> 15:58.498
THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE.

15:58.540 --> 15:59.256
[sighs]

16:05.130 --> 16:07.781
- JUST A LITTLE MORE HERE.

16:07.820 --> 16:10.641
- HANK...
- SMOOTH IT OUT.

16:10.690 --> 16:11.714
WHAT?

16:11.760 --> 16:13.375
- I THINK--
I REALLY THINK

16:13.420 --> 16:14.990
WE SHOULD SHOOT
AT THE BEACH.

16:15.040 --> 16:16.348
- THAT'S A BAD IDEA.
IT'S--

16:16.380 --> 16:18.109
OH, COME ON.
I TOLD YOU THIS.

16:18.140 --> 16:20.449
YOU DON'T GO TO THE BEACH
FOR A CORPORATE ANNUAL REPORT.

16:20.490 --> 16:22.287
- WHY NOT?
- BECAUSE YOU'RE ON A BUDGET.

16:22.320 --> 16:23.969
YOU'RE ON A DEADLINE, AND YOU'RE
NOT GONNA GET THE SHOTS.

16:24.010 --> 16:25.489
- YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

16:25.530 --> 16:27.634
- I DO KNOW IT.
I DO KNOW THAT.

16:27.670 --> 16:30.116
- I JUST FEEL LIKE
I SOLD THE GUY, YOU KNOW,

16:30.160 --> 16:31.775
I GOT THE JOB
BECAUSE I HAD A VISION,

16:31.810 --> 16:33.846
AND HE LOVED THE IDEA
OF SHOOTING AT THE BEACH.

16:33.880 --> 16:35.222
- WELL, I MEAN--
- WHAT? OH. HERE IT IS.

16:35.270 --> 16:37.079
- NO, I'M NOT GONNA SAY
ANYTHING.

16:37.130 --> 16:38.290
- HERE IT IS.
NO, NO.

16:38.340 --> 16:39.989
I CAN'T WAIT.
- WELL, YOU GOT IT

16:40.030 --> 16:40.997
BECAUSE, YEAH, OKAY,
YOU HAD A VISION,

16:41.030 --> 16:43.885
BUT ALSO,
IT HELPED THAT YOU--

16:43.930 --> 16:45.784
SLEEPING WITH THE TUXEDO GUY,
RIGHT?

16:45.830 --> 16:47.445
- OH, MY GOD.
[exhales]

16:47.480 --> 16:48.822
THAT IS NOT TRUE.

16:48.860 --> 16:49.792
- YOU'RE NOT SLEEPING
WITH HIM?

16:49.830 --> 16:50.967
- I DIDN'T--

16:51.010 --> 16:53.558
THAT'S NOT WHY
I GOT THE JOB.

16:53.590 --> 16:54.454
THAT'S SO INSULTING.

16:54.490 --> 16:55.969
THINK ABOUT WHAT
YOU JUST SAID TO ME.

16:56.010 --> 16:57.591
- HERE'S THE THING:
I DON'T GET THESE JOBS

16:57.630 --> 17:00.042
BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE
THE PERSONALITY THEY WANT.

17:00.080 --> 17:01.354
- YEAH.
- OKAY, BUT THEN THEY--

17:01.390 --> 17:03.426
THEY GIVE IT TO SOMEBODY
WHO HAS NO EXPERIENCE.

17:03.470 --> 17:04.323
- I DON'T HAVE NO EXPERIENCE.
- YOU HAVE NO EXPERIENCE.

17:04.360 --> 17:06.669
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE HERE
TO HELP ME.

17:06.710 --> 17:07.392
- I AM HERE TO HELP YOU.
I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU.

17:07.440 --> 17:09.226
- I'M SORRY.
I GOT THE JOB.

17:09.260 --> 17:11.057
THE WORLD ISN'T FAIR, OKAY?

17:11.090 --> 17:13.058
BUT I BROUGHT YOU IN
TO BE MY HELPER.

17:13.100 --> 17:15.330
- WELL, IT DIDN'T WORK.
IT'S NOT WORKING.

17:15.370 --> 17:17.713
I GOT THE BIG STARFISH
AND EVERYTHING.

17:17.760 --> 17:19.955
LET'S JUST--
YOU KNOW, I TRIED TO DO THIS.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.035
IT'S JUST NOT WORTH IT.

17:21.070 --> 17:22.890
- WELL, DON'T WALK AWAY.
- IT'S JUST NOT WORTH IT.

17:22.930 --> 17:24.033
- YOU'RE KIDDING ME!

17:24.070 --> 17:27.130
YOU'RE NOT WALKING OUT.

17:28.080 --> 17:29.035
OH, MY GOD.

17:29.080 --> 17:31.457
- OKAY.

17:31.490 --> 17:33.003
I ADMIT
THIS IS NOT THE RITZ.

17:33.050 --> 17:35.211
BUT OUR PROXIMITY
TO THE VENDING MACHINE--

17:35.260 --> 17:36.909
OH! IT'S UNPARALLELED.

17:36.950 --> 17:39.009
- OH, GOD, LOOK AT THAT.
- LOOK AT THIS.

17:39.050 --> 17:40.529
I MEAN, WE ARE INCHES AWAY.

17:40.570 --> 17:41.980
- OH, GREAT, GREAT.
- UH-HUH.

17:42.020 --> 17:42.987
- YOU KNOW, I REALLY HOPE
THIS ISN'T

17:43.020 --> 17:43.918
FOR MORE THAN A FEW DAYS,

17:43.950 --> 17:46.293
BECAUSE WE CAN'T--
WE CAN'T STAY HERE.

17:46.340 --> 17:47.989
- WE CAN 5--
WE CAN DO THIS.

17:48.030 --> 17:49.054
- NO.
- WE CAN MAKE THIS WORK.

17:49.100 --> 17:50.169
YOU JUST GOTTA HAVE
THE RIGHT MENTAL ATTITUDE.

17:50.200 --> 17:53.169
YOU CAN'T THINK OF IT
AS BEING STUCK IN A HOTEL.

17:53.210 --> 17:54.370
- A MOTEL.
IT'S A MOTEL.

17:54.410 --> 17:56.924
- TO-MAY-TO, TO-MAH-TO.
IN A MOTEL.

17:56.970 --> 17:57.959
YOU'VE GOTTA THINK OF IT
AS, LIKE,

17:58.000 --> 17:58.989
A FORCED FAMILY BONDING
EXERCISE.

17:59.040 --> 18:00.200
- MM.

18:00.250 --> 18:01.763
- AND THEN IT STARTS SOUNDING
REAL FUN.

18:01.800 --> 18:03.108
- OKAY.
- YOU KNOW HOW CLOSE

18:03.150 --> 18:04.174
WE'RE GONNA BE
WHEN WE LEAVE HERE?

18:04.220 --> 18:06.245
- YAY.
- RIGHT?

18:06.290 --> 18:08.076
- SO WHAT HAPPENS IF IT'S
FOR MORE THAN A FEW DAYS?

18:08.120 --> 18:08.905
YOU KNOW, LIKE,
WHAT DO WE DO THEN?

18:08.940 --> 18:10.214
WE CAN'T KEEP PAYING
FOR A MOTEL.

18:10.260 --> 18:12.490
- MM-HMM.
- CAN'T MOVE INTO MY MOM'S PLACE

18:12.530 --> 18:14.566
'CAUSE IT'S TOO SMALL,
AND THE ONLY OTHER PEOPLE

18:14.610 --> 18:16.703
WITH EXTRA ROOM ARE...
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

18:16.750 --> 18:18.297
- YOU KNOW, IS YOUR...
- NO, NO, NO, DON'T START...

18:18.330 --> 18:20.332
- PARENTS.
- THROWING THAT OUT HERE.

18:20.370 --> 18:21.678
THAT'S NOT AN OPTION.
- WHY NOT?

18:21.720 --> 18:23.051
- I LOVE YOU AND THE BABIES
TOO MUCH.

18:23.100 --> 18:24.328
TO PUT YOU
IN THAT SITUATION WOULD BE...

18:24.370 --> 18:26.406
- READY TO GO TO THE POOL.
- CATASTROPHIC.

18:26.450 --> 18:27.758
- SEE?

18:27.790 --> 18:29.655
THAT'S THE ATTITUDE
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

18:29.690 --> 18:30.588
THAT'S THE ATTITUDE
OF A WINNER, RIGHT?

18:30.620 --> 18:32.178
- WHOO!
- CANNONBALL CITY, POOL TIME.

18:32.210 --> 18:33.177
- YEAH.
- ARE YOU UP FOR A SWIM?

18:33.210 --> 18:34.177
- AWESOME.
- YEAH?

18:34.210 --> 18:35.586
- YAY.
- WHO'S THIS?

18:35.630 --> 18:36.517
IT'S THE MOLD DUDE.
MAYBE HE'S DONE.

18:36.560 --> 18:37.037
- GOOD, GOOD, GOOD.
- MAYBE HE'S DONE.

18:37.080 --> 18:39.480
- PLEASE.
- HELLO?

18:39.530 --> 18:41.282
[baby crying]
YEAH, THIS IS HIM.

18:41.320 --> 18:45.632
UH-HUH.
WELL--WELL, HOW--

18:45.670 --> 18:47.217
WELL, HOW--WHAT--HEY.
[snaps] HOW MUCH--

18:47.260 --> 18:49.637
WHAT'S "LONGER" MEAN?
WHAT--

18:49.680 --> 18:50.669
WHAT?

18:50.710 --> 18:52.746
- UGH.
- NO, NO, NO.

18:54.750 --> 18:56.365
- I WAS THINKING
I'D PICK THE KIDS UP

18:56.410 --> 18:58.787
FROM SCHOOL, YOU KNOW,
BRING 'EM BACK HERE.

18:58.820 --> 19:00.264
- I BETTER DO IT.
THEY'LL KNOW SOMETHING'S UP.

19:00.310 --> 19:02.574
- YEAH, YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT.
OKAY.

19:02.620 --> 19:07.205
SO, UH, I GUESS WE'LL JUST
MEET BACK HERE.

19:07.240 --> 19:09.549
- YEP.
- [groans]

19:09.590 --> 19:12.150
AND THEN...
AND THEN WE JUST DO IT.

19:12.180 --> 19:16.048
WE JUST...

19:16.080 --> 19:18.947
WE JUST TELL THEM.

19:18.980 --> 19:21.323
- YEAH, I GUESS SO.

19:21.360 --> 19:23.840
- IT'S GONNA BE OKAY,
YOU KNOW.

19:23.880 --> 19:27.577
UH, IT'S GONNA BE HARD,
BUT IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

19:27.610 --> 19:30.534
- IS IT?

19:33.240 --> 19:35.788
- I GOTTA GO.
I'LL SEE YOU THIS AFTERNOON.

19:35.820 --> 19:38.232
- JOEL.

19:38.280 --> 19:39.759
- [sighs]

19:39.790 --> 19:41.929
YEAH?

19:44.320 --> 19:45.799
- DON'T DO IT.

19:45.830 --> 19:46.967
DON'T MOVE OUT.

19:47.010 --> 19:49.661
IT'S NOT TOO LATE TO CHANGE
YOUR MIND, YOU KNOW.

19:49.700 --> 19:51.144
WE CAN JUST--

19:51.190 --> 19:53.329
WE CAN--

19:53.360 --> 19:56.397
WE CAN WORK ON THE MARRIAGE,
AND I CAN...

19:58.400 --> 20:01.915
BE DIFFERENT
OR TRY HARDER.

20:03.060 --> 20:05.221
AND JUST...

20:06.890 --> 20:07.549
DON'T GIVE UP ON ME.

20:07.580 --> 20:10.265
COME--

20:13.790 --> 20:14.996
- I'M SO SORRY.

20:15.040 --> 20:17.861
I WISH WE WEREN'T
AT THIS POINT.

20:20.970 --> 20:24.622
BUT WE ARE.

20:24.670 --> 20:26.456
I GOTTA GO.

20:33.020 --> 20:35.818
- WE'VE HAD A CHANCE
TO LOOK OVER THE I.E.P.

20:35.850 --> 20:37.499
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

20:37.540 --> 20:41.499
- HONESTLY, UH,
WE'RE NOT FEELING SO GOOD.

20:41.550 --> 20:43.780
UM, I WOULD LIKE
TO REOPEN THE DISCUSSION

20:43.820 --> 20:46.232
UNDER SECTION FIVE
AND REQUEST THAT KIARA

20:46.270 --> 20:48.022
BE PUT BACK
IN THE MAINSTREAM CLASSROOM

20:48.070 --> 20:50.686
WITH THE HELP OF A ONE-ON-ONE
PARAPROFESSIONAL AIDE.

20:50.730 --> 20:52.038
- [exhales]

20:52.070 --> 20:54.630
THOSE AIDES CAN DO
TREMENDOUS WORK, CAN'T THEY?

20:54.660 --> 20:56.969
- YES.
- THERE ARE TWO REASONS

20:57.010 --> 20:57.760
WHY I DON'T THINK IT'S RIGHT

20:57.800 --> 20:59.313
FOR THIS PARTICULAR
SITUATION.

20:59.360 --> 21:01.180
ONE, WE DON'T LIKE
TO PUT AIDES

21:01.220 --> 21:03.427
IN THE HIGH SCHOOL CLASSES.

21:03.460 --> 21:05.633
IN MIDDLE SCHOOL,
THEY'RE FABULOUS,

21:05.670 --> 21:06.739
BUT BEYOND THAT,

21:06.780 --> 21:08.088
THE RESULTS ARE
VERY RARELY WORTH

21:08.120 --> 21:09.599
THE DISTRACT IONS.

21:09.640 --> 21:12.359
AND TWO,
THE COSTS ARE PROHIBITIVE,

21:12.400 --> 21:15.096
EXCEPT WHEN THE SITUATION
ABSOLUTELY REQUIRES IT.

21:15.130 --> 21:16.336
- MAY I SAY SOMETHING?

21:16.370 --> 21:17.712
I THINK THAT KIARA
IS SUCH A GREAT STUDENT.

21:17.750 --> 21:19.502
SHE'S SMART AS A WHIP,
AND I THINK THAT

21:19.550 --> 21:20.778
SHE'S COLLEGE BOUND,

21:20.830 --> 21:21.546
BUT IN ORDER FOR HER
TO GET THERE,

21:21.590 --> 21:23.342
SHE NEEDS TO BE
IN A SETTING

21:23.380 --> 21:24.608
THAT CHALLENGES HER
ACADEMICALLY...

21:24.660 --> 21:26.059
- MRS. BRAVERMAN, I--
- AND SOCIALLY AN D--

21:26.110 --> 21:27.589
YES?
- WE TRIED PUTTING HER

21:27.630 --> 21:28.176
IN A MAINSTREAM CLASSROOM
LAST YEAR,

21:28.210 --> 21:30.246
AND HER GRADES SUFFERED.

21:30.280 --> 21:33.044
- YES, BUT THE WORKLOAD
WAS NOT THE ISSUE.

21:33.080 --> 21:34.354
IT--IT'S JUST--IT'S--

21:34.390 --> 21:36.312
THE CLASSROOM WAS
A LITTLE OVERWHELMING.

21:36.360 --> 21:38.146
AND SO I'M THINKING
THAT IF SHE HAS THE AIDE,

21:38.190 --> 21:39.179
MAYBE SHE CAN KEEP UP.

21:39.220 --> 21:40.596
- I THINK THE BEST THING
TO DO

21:40.640 --> 21:42.392
IS TO FIND A WAY
TO CHALLENGE HER

21:42.430 --> 21:45.058
WHILE KEEPING HER
IN THE SPECIAL ED ROOM.

21:45.090 --> 21:47.888
- AND HOW WOULD YOU DO THAT?
HOW?

21:47.920 --> 21:49.569
I MEAN, I'VE SEEN
THE SPECIAL ED ROOM,

21:49.610 --> 21:50.406
AND SHE DOES NOT
BELONG THERE.

21:50.440 --> 21:53.716
I'M SORRY, JUST--
IT'S FRUSTRATING.

21:55.590 --> 21:58.343
- WHAT IF WE OFFER AN ADDITIONAL
CHECK-IN EACH DAY

21:58.380 --> 22:01.099
WITH THE SPECIAL ED TEACHER,
MRS. CRUMLEY?

22:01.140 --> 22:03.415
I THINK BRINGING THE CHECK-INS
FROM TWO TO THREE

22:03.460 --> 22:06.452
WILL HELP THE CHILD
TREMENDOUSLY.

22:08.810 --> 22:11.426
- OK--THAT SOUNDS--
THAT SOUNDS LIKE IT COULD WORK.

22:11.460 --> 22:12.734
- GOOD. ALL RIGHT.

22:12.770 --> 22:15.352
MOVING ON TO SPEECH THERAPY--

22:15.400 --> 22:19.257
UNLESS ANYONE HAS
ANYTHING ELSE TO ADD?

22:19.300 --> 22:23.885
OKAY.

22:23.920 --> 22:25.126
- WE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT WE WERE ADVOCATING FOR.

22:25.170 --> 22:27.263
- RIGHT.

22:27.310 --> 22:28.641
- THIS POOR GIRL
DOESN'T HAVE ANY OPTIONS.

22:28.690 --> 22:30.169
LIKE, SHE SHOULDN'T BE
IN MAINSTREAM,

22:30.210 --> 22:31.029
BUT SHE SHOULDN'T BE
IN SPECIAL ED,

22:31.070 --> 22:32.298
SO IT'S LIKE,
WHERE DO WE PUT HER?

22:32.350 --> 22:33.442
- SOUNDS LIKE MAX.

22:33.490 --> 22:35.378
- IT'S EXACTLY LIKE MAX.
THAT'S THE THING.

22:35.420 --> 22:38.412
I WAS SITTING THERE
THE WHOLE TIME

22:38.460 --> 22:40.007
TRYING TO COMPARE
THE TWO SITUATIONS,

22:40.040 --> 22:41.359
AND I COULDN'T, AND I'M, LIKE,
THINKING, NEXT YEAR,

22:41.390 --> 22:43.551
WHERE'S MAX GONNA BE
FOR HIGH SCHOOL?

22:43.600 --> 22:45.636
- NEXT YEAR.
- NEXT YEAR.

22:45.670 --> 22:47.251
YOU KNOW HOW FAST THAT WENT?
- HIGH SCHOOL.

22:47.290 --> 22:49.258
- LIKE, WHAT ARE WE DOING?
- YEAH.

22:49.290 --> 22:51.463
- [sighs]
I DON'T KNOW.

22:51.500 --> 22:52.182
I JUST FELT BADLY,
'CAUSE I WANTED TO HELP HER,

22:52.230 --> 22:54.915
AND I DIDN'T.

22:54.950 --> 22:56.747
I DIDN'T.
- I'M SORRY.

22:56.780 --> 22:59.169
LISTEN, I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN
DEALING WITH THIS I.E.P. STUFF,

22:59.200 --> 23:02.579
BUT CAN YOU HANDLE A LITTLE MORE
POTENTIALLY BAD NEWS?

23:02.620 --> 23:03.848
- ARE YOU KIDDING?
- NO.

23:03.890 --> 23:05.892
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- MAX'S HISTORY TEACHER

23:05.930 --> 23:06.510
HAS BEEN SENDING HIM
TO THE LIBRARY

23:06.550 --> 23:08.484
EVERY DAY DURING CLASS.

23:08.520 --> 23:09.555
- WAIT, I'M SORRY, WHAT?

23:09.590 --> 23:10.557
- I JUST FOUND OUT
FROM MAX.

23:10.590 --> 23:11.818
THE DETAILS I GOT
WERE VAGUE,

23:11.870 --> 23:13.963
BUT FROM WHAT I CAN TELL,
THIS MR. WYMAN,

23:14.010 --> 23:15.762
I THINK, JUST DOESN'T WANT
TO DEAL WITH HIM.

23:15.800 --> 23:16.698
- HE HAS TO DEAL WITH HIM.

23:16.740 --> 23:18.526
HE CAN'T JUST SEND HIM
TO THE LIBRARY.

23:18.560 --> 23:20.448
- EDUCATIONALLY ADVOCATE
THAT SITUATION.

23:20.500 --> 23:21.876
- NO, THAT IS RIDICULOUS.
HE CAN'T DO THAT.

23:21.910 --> 23:23.593
WHAT IS HAPPENING THIS YEAR?
- ADVOCATE HIS ASS.

23:23.640 --> 23:25.119
- I'M GONNA ADVOCATE HIS ASS.
- YEAH.

23:25.160 --> 23:26.149
- WHAT IS HIS NAME?

23:26.190 --> 23:27.600
- MR. WYMAN.
- MR. WYMAN.

23:27.640 --> 23:29.119
GUESS WHAT--I WANT YOU TO SET
A MEETING WITH HIM.

23:29.160 --> 23:29.956
- I DID ALREADY.
- DO IT.

23:29.990 --> 23:31.127
- WE'RE HAVING A MEETING.
- WHEN?

23:31.160 --> 23:31.842
- TOMORROW.
- GOOD.

23:31.890 --> 23:32.606
- WE'RE GONNA TALK TO MR. WYMAN.

23:32.650 --> 23:34.470
- MR. HYMEN.
- IT'S MR. WYMAN.

23:34.510 --> 23:36.649
- WHATEVER.
- DON'T--

23:36.690 --> 23:38.954
- I'M GONNA BREAK HIM.
- PLEASE DON'T DO THIS TO ME.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.820
- THE BEACH, YOU CAN'T--
YOU CAN'T ON A BUDGET.

23:40.860 --> 23:42.589
YOU CAN'T GO TO THE BEACH.
THERE'S SAND.

23:42.620 --> 23:43.552
THERE'S WIND AT THE BEACH.

23:43.590 --> 23:44.989
THE BEACH NEVER IS GOOD
FOR A DEADLINE.

23:45.040 --> 23:46.007
THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS.

23:46.040 --> 23:47.519
- YOU'VE BEEN TALKING
ABOUT THE BEACH

23:47.560 --> 23:49.653
AND ONLY THE BEACH
FOR THE ENTIRE AFTERNOON.

23:49.700 --> 23:50.212
YOU'RE PERSEVERATING.

23:50.250 --> 23:52.389
- PERS--PERS--WHAT?

23:52.430 --> 23:53.738
- PERSEVERATING.

23:53.770 --> 23:55.146
IT MEANS YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT ONE SUBJECT

23:55.190 --> 23:57.465
OR ONE THING FOR AN EXTENDED
PERIOD OF TIME.

23:57.500 --> 23:58.979
WHILE YOU MAY FIND IT
VERY INTERESTING,

23:59.020 --> 24:02.126
OTHER PEOPLE GENERALLY
FIND IT ANNOYING.

24:02.160 --> 24:03.673
- PERSEVERATING, HUH?

24:03.710 --> 24:05.189
- YEAH.
- YEAH, WELL,

24:05.230 --> 24:06.367
YOU DO THAT TOO,
YOU KNOW.

24:06.410 --> 24:08.219
- I KNOW, AND THEN YOU TELL ME
THAT I'M BEING ANNOYING.

24:08.270 --> 24:11.125
- [chuckles]
OKAY.

24:11.170 --> 24:12.159
YOU MAKE A GOOD POINT.

24:12.200 --> 24:13.406
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU KEEP COMPLAINING

24:13.450 --> 24:14.542
ABOUT THE BEACH.

24:14.590 --> 24:15.727
I MEAN, YOU ALREADY QUIT
THE JOB.

24:15.760 --> 24:17.136
YOUR PROBLEM IS OVER.

24:17.170 --> 24:19.240
- I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT ANYMORE.

24:19.280 --> 24:20.588
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

24:20.630 --> 24:22.586
LET'S TALK ABOUT
THE UNION PACIFIC RAILROAD.

24:22.630 --> 24:23.619
- HERE'S WHAT THE STINK
OF IT IS:

24:23.660 --> 24:24.831
I WAS ONLY TRYING TO HELP,
OKAY?

24:24.870 --> 24:26.246
- IT WAS INCORPORATED
IN 1862

24:26.290 --> 24:27.496
BY AN ACT OF CONGRESS.

24:27.530 --> 24:28.690
- AND NOW I QUIT,

24:28.740 --> 24:30.219
AND SHE'S GONNA FALL
ON HER FACE.

24:30.260 --> 24:31.397
THAT'S A METAPHOR,
BY THE WAY.

24:31.430 --> 24:32.590
SHE'S NOT REALLY GONNA FALL
ON HER FACE.

24:32.640 --> 24:34.915
SHE'S GONNA FAIL.
FAIL BADLY.

24:34.950 --> 24:37.157
- THE ACT WAS APPROVED
BY PRESIDENT ABRAHAM LINCOLN.

24:37.190 --> 24:40.330
AND I DON'T THINK
THAT AUNT SARAH WILL FAIL.

24:40.370 --> 24:42.509
- HEY, THAT WAS GOOD.

24:42.550 --> 24:44.882
YOU--YOU ACTUALLY STOPPED
PERSEVERATING THERE.

24:44.930 --> 24:46.682
YOU KNOW IT?
YOU STARTED TALKING

24:46.720 --> 24:47.618
ABOUT MY THING,
INSTEAD OF YOURS.

24:47.650 --> 24:49.231
YOU DID GOOD, MAX.

24:49.280 --> 24:50.759
- THANK YOU.

24:50.790 --> 24:52.439
AND I THINK THAT
MY AUNT SARAH'S WAY

24:52.490 --> 24:53.411
IS BETTER THAN YOURS.

24:53.450 --> 24:54.485
- ALL RIGHT,

24:54.520 --> 24:56.511
NOW YOU'RE BEING STUPID,
OKAY?

24:56.560 --> 24:57.584
GO BACK TO THE RAILROAD.

24:57.630 --> 24:58.858
- I DON'T LIKE PHOTOSHOP,

24:58.910 --> 25:00.002
AND I DON'T LIKE
BEING OUTSIDE EITHER,

25:00.050 --> 25:01.733
BUT WHEN YOU'RE OUTSIDE,
THE PHOTOS COME OUT BETTER.

25:01.770 --> 25:03.909
- YEAH, BUT THERE'S A RISK,
OKAY?

25:03.950 --> 25:05.394
THERE'S A RISK,
AND WE'RE ON A BUDGET.

25:05.430 --> 25:07.773
HERS IS A RISK.
MINE, SURE THING.

25:07.810 --> 25:08.492
- BUT YOURS ISN'T
A SURE THING,

25:08.540 --> 25:10.189
'CAUSE YOURS
ISN'T HAPPENING.

25:10.230 --> 25:13.199
YOU DIDN'T GET THE JOB.
MY AUNT SARAH DID.

25:17.370 --> 25:19.019
- YOU'RE A PRETTY SMART KID,
MAX.

25:19.060 --> 25:20.402
- I KNOW.

25:20.440 --> 25:23.409
- ANDI

25:23.450 --> 25:28.069
WILL HOLD YOU TIGHT

25:28.110 --> 25:29.179
LIKE THE MOON

25:29.210 --> 25:31.075
- DADDY.
HEY.

25:31.110 --> 25:32.589
- HEY.

25:32.630 --> 25:34.279
HEY, GUYS.
COME HERE.

25:34.320 --> 25:36.288
HAVE A SEAT.

25:36.320 --> 25:37.878
UH, BOTH OF YOU, ACTUALLY.
- WHY?

25:37.910 --> 25:39.491
- UM...

25:39.530 --> 25:41.634
- YOUR DAD AND I
WANT TO TALK TO YOU--

25:41.670 --> 25:43.490
YOU BOTH ABOUT SOMETHING.

25:43.540 --> 25:47.328
- THAT'S RIGHT.
- WHAT'S WRONG?

25:47.370 --> 25:49.884
- OKAY, UH,

25:49.920 --> 25:51.979
FIRST OF ALL, YOUR MOM AND I
WANT YOU TO KNOW

25:52.030 --> 25:54.612
THAT WE BOTH JUST
LOVE YOU GUYS SO MUCH.

25:54.650 --> 25:58.438
AND, YOU KNOW,
YOUR MOM AND I,

25:58.480 --> 25:59.469
UH, HAVE BEEN FIGHTING
A LOT LATELY.

25:59.520 --> 26:01.238
I KNOW YOU'VE PICKED UP
ON THAT.

26:01.280 --> 26:04.511
AND WE DON'T WANT TO BE
THOSE KIND OF PARENTS.

26:04.560 --> 26:06.312
SO YOUR MOM AND I
WERE THINKING--

26:06.350 --> 26:08.932
I WAS THINKING

26:08.980 --> 26:10.663
THAT IT'D BE BEST
IF I MOVED OUT

26:10.700 --> 26:11.803
FOR JUST A LITTLE WHILE.

26:11.840 --> 26:13.569
- NO, NO,
YOU CAN'T DO THIS.

26:13.600 --> 26:14.453
WE'RE A FAMILY.
YOU CAN'T GO.

26:14.500 --> 26:17.116
- I KNOW, SWEETHEART.
- NO, YOU CAN'T!

26:17.160 --> 26:19.390
- SONS AND DAUGHTERS

26:19.430 --> 26:21.318
AND ALL THOSE EVENINGS

26:21.370 --> 26:25.818
DOWN IN THE GARDEN
WITH RED, RED WINE

26:25.860 --> 26:28.363
THOSE QUIET HOURS

26:28.410 --> 26:34.474
TURNING TO YEARS

26:34.520 --> 26:39.207
IT'S ALL TO COME

26:41.460 --> 26:43.974
[knock at door]
- JUST A SECOND.

26:50.050 --> 26:53.497
- TURNS OUT, UH, IT'S SUNNY
IN SANTA CRUZ TODAY,

26:53.540 --> 26:55.849
SO, I MEAN,
WHAT WERE THE ODDS OF THAT?

26:55.890 --> 26:58.882
I'M NOT SAYING THAT'S
THE BETTER WAY TO GO,

26:58.920 --> 27:03.198
BUT...

27:03.240 --> 27:06.960
YOU'RE THE BOSS.

27:07.000 --> 27:07.921
- MAX IS
A VERY BRIGHT STUDENT.

27:07.970 --> 27:10.200
BUT HIS DISTRACT IONS
MAKE IT HARD FOR ME

27:10.240 --> 27:11.514
TO TEACH THE OTHER KIDS.

27:11.560 --> 27:13.767
AND I FIND HE DOES REALLY WELL
WORKING INDEPENDENTLY.

27:13.800 --> 27:14.585
- WORKING INDEPENDENTLY?
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE CALLING IT?

27:14.630 --> 27:16.723
- MR. BRAVERMAN,
I'M DOING MY BEST.

27:16.770 --> 27:18.249
BUT I HAVE 29 KIDS
IN THAT CLASS.

27:18.290 --> 27:20.906
- OKAY, WE GET THAT YOU HAVE
29 KIDS IN YOUR CLASS,

27:20.940 --> 27:21.975
BUT WHAT YOU'RE NOT REALIZING

27:22.010 --> 27:23.739
IS THAT MAX
IS ONE OF THEM.

27:23.780 --> 27:24.849
I MEAN, THIS IS RIDICULOUS.
[door opens]

27:24.880 --> 27:27.257
- I FILLED PRINCIPAL RADFORD IN
ON THE SITUATION.

27:27.300 --> 27:28.949
HE THOUGHT IT'D BE BEST
IF HE JOINED US.

27:28.990 --> 27:30.434
- OH, GOOD,
SO WE CAN TALK TO YOU

27:30.470 --> 27:32.711
ABOUT HOW YOU'VE DECIDED
TO LET HIM WORK INDEPENDENTLY

27:32.750 --> 27:34.058
IN THE LIBRARY.
- WE'VE BEEN IN THESE SEATS

27:34.100 --> 27:35.192
A LOT THIS YEAR,
HAVEN'T WE?

27:35.230 --> 27:36.401
- YES, YES, WE HAVE.

27:36.440 --> 27:38.089
- I UNDERSTAND YOUR FRUSTRATION.
- I DON'T THINK YOU DO.

27:38.130 --> 27:39.859
OTHERWISE, WE WOULDN'T BE
SITTING IN THESE SEATS AGAIN.

27:39.890 --> 27:41.517
- MR. BRAVERMAN,
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

27:41.550 --> 27:43.927
MR. WYMAN SHOULD'VE CONTACTED
YOU WHEN THE PROBLEM STARTED.

27:43.970 --> 27:45.346
AND FOR THAT, I APOLOGIZE.

27:45.380 --> 27:47.553
- THANK YOU.
- BUT HERE'S THE BOTTOM LINE.

27:47.590 --> 27:48.761
MAX HAS TROUBLE LEARNING

27:48.800 --> 27:49.869
IN A MAINSTREAM CLASSROOM
ENVIRONMENT.

27:49.900 --> 27:51.413
MR. WYMAN HAS TROUBLE TEACHING
WHEN MAX IS THERE.

27:51.460 --> 27:54.907
RIGHT NOW,
NO ONE IS WINNING.

27:54.940 --> 27:55.690
I KNOW THIS SOLUTION
IS NOT IDEAL,

27:55.740 --> 27:58.117
BUT FOR NOW,
THE BEST WE CAN DO

27:58.150 --> 27:59.594
IS TELL YOU THAT
WHEN MAX HAS

27:59.640 --> 28:01.187
A TOUGH OR DISRUPTIVE DAY,

28:01.230 --> 28:03.084
HE'LL BE SENT TO THE LIBRARY
TO WORK ON HIS OWN.

28:03.120 --> 28:04.257
I THINK THAT'S A GOOD SOLUTION
FOR EVERYONE.

28:04.300 --> 28:06.575
- I DISAGREE.
I THINK THAT HE SHOULD BE

28:06.610 --> 28:07.679
IN THE CLASSROOM
WITH HIS PEERS.

28:07.720 --> 28:08.744
THERE HAS TO BE
ANOTHER SOLUTION.

28:08.790 --> 28:11.304
CAN HE AT LEAST BE TRANSFERRED
TO ANOTHER CLASS?

28:11.340 --> 28:12.614
- WE WILL LOOK INTO THAT.

28:12.650 --> 28:14.538
HOWEVER, AT THIS TIME,
I CAN ASSURE YOU,

28:14.580 --> 28:15.512
WE ARE UTILIZING
ALL OF OUR RESOURCES

28:15.550 --> 28:17.370
TO SERVE MAX.

28:17.410 --> 28:19.105
- SO WHAT, THAT'S IT?

28:19.140 --> 28:19.993
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO?
THAT'S IT?

28:20.040 --> 28:21.246
- THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M SAYING
AT ALL.

28:21.280 --> 28:23.862
I'M SAYING
IT'S A TOUGH SITUATION,

28:23.900 --> 28:25.310
AND WE ARE DOING
OUR BEST.

28:25.350 --> 28:28.387
- WELL, I THINK THAT YOUR BEST
IS UNACCEPTABLE.

28:28.430 --> 28:31.046
I REALLY DO.

28:40.440 --> 28:42.294
- YOU KNOW, THIS, UM,

28:42.340 --> 28:44.888
ITALIAN ROAST STUFF
IS PRETTY GOOD, YOU KNOW?

28:44.930 --> 28:46.716
- RIGHT, ISN'T IT?

28:46.750 --> 28:48.718
ISN'T IT WONDERFUL?
- YEAH.

28:50.760 --> 28:52.580
PRETTY STRANGE BEING HERE
WITHOUT YOU, MILLIE.

28:52.620 --> 28:55.726
- [laughs]
YEAH, I'LL BET.

28:55.760 --> 28:58.274
- I MEAN, A BIG HOUSE,
JUST ME.

28:58.320 --> 28:59.218
- WELL, THE KIDS CAME BY,
DIDN'T THEY?

28:59.250 --> 29:02.219
- YEAH, KIDS CAME BY.
THAT WAS GREAT.

29:02.250 --> 29:03.899
THAT WAS NICE.

29:06.260 --> 29:10.356
YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T LIKE
BEING HERE WITHOUT YOU.

29:10.400 --> 29:13.437
AND NOW, UM,

29:13.470 --> 29:14.949
NOW THAT YOU'RE BACK,

29:14.990 --> 29:18.983
YOU'RE NOT ALL THE WAY BACK,
YOU KNOW?

29:19.030 --> 29:22.648
NOT ALL OF YOU IS HERE.

29:22.690 --> 29:23.714
[snickers]

29:23.760 --> 29:25.273
- [laughs]
I'M ALL HERE.

29:25.310 --> 29:27.278
- NO, I DON'T--I DON'T MEAN IT
IN A BAD WAY.

29:27.310 --> 29:29.756
YOU WENT OUT THERE,
AND YOU HAD

29:29.800 --> 29:33.270
THIS WONDERFUL ADVENTURE,
THIS--

29:33.320 --> 29:35.242
GOT A TASTE FOR LIFE.

29:35.290 --> 29:37.929
AND YOU'RE HAPPY.

29:37.980 --> 29:41.188
YOU'RE THE HAPPIEST
I'VE EVER SEEN YOU.

29:41.220 --> 29:42.801
- WELL, THAT'S A GOOD THING,
RIGHT?

29:42.850 --> 29:44.499
- YEAH.
YEAH, IT'S A GOOD THING.

29:47.880 --> 29:50.462
THE BAD THING, SWEETHEART,
IS THAT, UH,

29:50.510 --> 29:53.673
I CAN'T HELP BUT...

29:53.720 --> 29:56.780
FEEL THAT...

29:56.820 --> 29:58.856
I WAS THE ONE
THAT WAS HOLDING YOU BACK

29:58.900 --> 30:03.132
FROM BEING HAPPY.

30:03.180 --> 30:05.580
- I JUST NEEDED
A LITTLE ADVENTURE.

30:05.630 --> 30:07.109
THAT'S ALL.

30:09.320 --> 30:11.356
- I DON'T WANT
TO LOSE YOU, MILLIE.

30:11.390 --> 30:13.210
- YOU'RE NOT LOSING ME.

30:13.250 --> 30:17.664
- SEE, WHILE YOU WERE GONE,
I REALIZED THAT, UH...

30:17.710 --> 30:20.326
OH, GOD.

30:20.370 --> 30:22.531
IT'S HARD.

30:22.570 --> 30:23.537
[exhales]

30:23.580 --> 30:26.743
WELL, I--

30:26.790 --> 30:29.998
IN OUR MARRIAGE, THAT...

30:30.030 --> 30:31.406
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT'S MADE
MOST OF THE COMPROMISES.

30:31.450 --> 30:35.090
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT'S DONE
MOST OF THE SACRIFICING.

30:35.140 --> 30:36.471
YOU'VE BEEN HERE
FOR THE FAMILY.

30:36.520 --> 30:39.068
ALL THE TIME.

30:39.110 --> 30:42.694
AND IF SELLING THIS HOUSE
IS IMPORTANT TO YOU,

30:42.730 --> 30:44.903
AND I KNOW IT IS,

30:44.940 --> 30:46.350
THEN I'M WILLING
TO DO THAT.

30:46.390 --> 30:49.632
FOR YOU.

30:49.670 --> 30:51.217
FOR US.

30:51.260 --> 30:54.809
BECAUSE BEING IN THIS HOUSE
WITHOUT YOU

30:54.850 --> 30:57.887
IS JUST NOT GONNA WORK.

31:07.450 --> 31:12.274
- OKAY. OKAY, JABBAR'S
IN THE SHOWER.

31:12.310 --> 31:13.379
I FOUND A CLEAN PAIR OF PANTS
IN A BAG

31:13.420 --> 31:15.797
THAT DIDN'T EVEN HAVE
CLOTHES IN IT.

31:15.830 --> 31:16.489
BUT, I MEAN,
HE'S NOT GONNA MATCH,

31:16.520 --> 31:17.908
BUT THEY'RE AT LEAST CLEAN.

31:17.940 --> 31:19.521
I DIDN'T THINK
WE HAD ANY LEI-T.

31:19.560 --> 31:20.731
HOW'S THAT GOING?

31:20.770 --> 31:22.078
- NOT GOOD.
- MM.

31:22.120 --> 31:24.634
- THIS IS ALL GONNA COST US
MONEY WE DON'T HAVE.

31:24.670 --> 31:25.898
[sighs]

31:25.950 --> 31:27.394
- WELL, YOU KNOW,
IT'S AN ESTIMATE.

31:27.430 --> 31:29.466
YOU KNOW, THE GUY SAID
TWO MONTHS IS AN ESTIMATE.

31:29.500 --> 31:30.467
MAYBE IT'LL GO FASTER.

31:30.500 --> 31:32.127
- OR MAYBE IT'LL GO SLOWER.
I MEAN,

31:32.160 --> 31:34.299
EVEN IF IT TOOK TWO WEEKS,
WE CAN'T AFFORD THIS.

31:34.340 --> 31:35.910
COME LOOK.
- [murmurlng]

31:35.960 --> 31:36.608

31:36.650 --> 31:38.436
[metal crashes, toy squeaks]

31:38.480 --> 31:39.469
- SHH! THE BABY'S SLEEPING!
- I KNOW, I KNOW.

31:39.510 --> 31:41.478
OH, NO, SHE'S NOT UP.

31:41.520 --> 31:43.659
OKAY, I CAN'T LIVE
IN THIS ROOM ANYMORE.

31:43.690 --> 31:44.725
- YEAH, WE CAN'T AFFORD TO LIVE
IN THIS ROOM ANYMORE.

31:44.760 --> 31:46.796
- THAT'S HOW MUCH IT'S GONNA
COST TO STAY HERE?

31:46.830 --> 31:47.933
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

31:47.970 --> 31:50.894
- THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING
TO SAY.

31:50.940 --> 31:52.214
- HONEY, MY CHEST
JUST CONSTRICTED.

31:52.250 --> 31:55.048
LIKE, SINCERELY,
I HAVE CONSTRICT ION IN MY CHEST.

31:55.080 --> 31:56.115

31:56.150 --> 31:57.424
- JUST BREATHE.
[Inhales]

31:57.460 --> 31:59.041
WE'RE GONNA GET THROUGH IT.
IT'S GONNA BE FINE.

31:59.080 --> 32:01.219
- HOW CAN IT BE THAT MUCH?
THIS PLACE IS A DUMP!

32:01.260 --> 32:02.420
- YEP.

32:02.470 --> 32:04.153
- HOW COME YOU'RE NOT
ALL SPUN OUT ABOUT THIS?

32:04.190 --> 32:05.009
- BECAUSE, UM,
WELL, GROWING UP,

32:05.060 --> 32:08.268
WE WENT THROUGH A LOT WORSE,
SO...

32:08.300 --> 32:10.359
WE GOT THROUGH IT THEN.
WE'LL GET THROUGH IT NOW.

32:10.410 --> 32:11.195
TOGETHER. WE GOT THIS.
WE'LL--

32:11.230 --> 32:14.575
- WHY DO YOU HAVE ZERO

32:14.620 --> 32:15.951
FOR THE HOUSE RENTAL BUDGET?

32:16.000 --> 32:16.898
WE'RE--IF WE'RE LEAVING HERE,

32:16.930 --> 32:19.137
HOW ARE WE GONNA RENT A HOUSE
FOR ZERO?

32:19.170 --> 32:21.172
- I DOUBT YOUR PARENTS
WILL CHARGE US RENT MONEY.

32:21.210 --> 32:23.792
- MY PARENTS? WHAT--

32:23.830 --> 32:27.140

32:35.400 --> 32:38.153
OKAY, I'M GONNA CALL 'EM.
- MM-HMM.

32:38.190 --> 32:39.361

WHEN YOU SAID THAT NOW,

32:39.400 --> 32:40.810
MY ARM JUST GOT NUMB
ON THE LEI-T SIDE.

32:40.850 --> 32:41.919
- AW, LET ME MASSAGE IT FOR YOU.

32:41.960 --> 32:44.019
CARDIAC ARREST.
I KNOW YOU THINK THIS IS FUNNY,

BUT THAT'S ONE OF THE SIGNS,
IS YOUR THING GOES NUMB.

32:45.480 --> 32:47.050

- YEAH, YOUR RIGHT OR LEI-T.

32:47.100 --> 32:48.681
- IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

32:48.720 --> 32:50.096
- I'LL JUST MAKE SURE
THAT YOU'RE ALL WARMED UP.

32:50.140 --> 32:51.232

HAND'S GOOD,

32:51.270 --> 32:54.273

32:56.800 --> 32:59.132
[footsteps approach]

32:59.180 --> 33:02.308

33:30.380 --> 33:34.316
OR WOULD IT BE BETTER FOR YOU

33:36.110 --> 33:39.170
- JUST COME IN.

33:39.220 --> 33:42.280
- YEAH, OKAY.

33:45.330 --> 33:48.083
WELL--

A VICTORY, THOUGH, DOES IT?

37:22.890 --> 37:23.925
- NO.
- IT'S SORT OF--

37:23.960 --> 37:26.372
- FEELS LIKE A BAND-AID
PLACED OVER A--

37:26.410 --> 37:27.581
WHAT DO YOU CALL
WHEN YOUR ARTERY

37:27.620 --> 37:29.372

HE'S NOT GOING
TO THE PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOL HERE.

37:36.940 --> 37:39.147
HE CAN'T.

37:39.180 --> 37:40.977
- [sighs]
OKAY.

37:41.010 --> 37:42.420
- YOU KNOW?

37:42.460 --> 37:44.257
- WELL, WE'LL FIGHT
THE DISTRICT

37:44.290 --> 37:44.904
AND SEE IF WE CAN GET HIM PLACED
SOMEWHERE ELSE.

37:44.950 --> 37:46.838
- WHERE?
- I DON'T KNOW.

37:46.880 --> 37:48.393
- THIS IS A LIST OF SCHOOLS
IN THE BAY AREA

37:48.430 --> 37:49.397
FOR KIDS
WITH SPECIAL NEEDS.

37:49.430 --> 37:50.704
HE DOESN'T FIT IN ANYWHERE.

37:50.750 --> 37:52.229
THERE'S NOWHERE
TO PUT HIM.

37:52.270 --> 37:53.532
- SO YOU'RE SAYING
NO PUBLIC SCHOOL?

37:53.580 --> 37:54.911
- NO.

37:54.960 --> 37:56.291
- WELL, WHAT ABOUT GATEWAY?

37:56.340 --> 37:57.614
NOEL LESSING'S DONE
GREAT THERE.

37:57.650 --> 37:59.857
- GATEWAY IS GREAT FOR KIDS
LIKE NOEL LESSING.

37:59.890 --> 38:00.549
HE HAS SEVERE AUTISM.

38:00.580 --> 38:02.468
- WELL, I--
- YOU KNOW?

38:02.520 --> 38:03.714
- WELL, WHAT ABOUT PROVIDENCE?

38:03.760 --> 38:05.409
- MAX'S TEST SCORES
ARE WAY TOO HIGH.

38:05.450 --> 38:08.271
WAY TOO HIGH.

38:08.320 --> 38:09.719
- SINCE WHEN ARE
HIGH TEST SCORES PROBLEMATIC?

38:09.770 --> 38:10.691
- I DON'T KNOW.

38:10.730 --> 38:11.583
- I'M VERY FRUSTRATED,
YOU KNOW.

38:11.630 --> 38:13.382
I HATE TO SEE MAX
GET SHUFFLED AROUND

38:13.420 --> 38:14.899
ALL THE TIME LIKE THIS.

38:14.940 --> 38:16.498
WHERE DO YOU PUT A KID
WHO DOESN'T BELONG ANYWHERE?

38:16.530 --> 38:17.838
- I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S THE SYSTEM.

38:17.880 --> 38:19.768
I MEAN, WE'RE STUCK
WITH THE SYSTEM.

38:19.810 --> 38:21.562
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,
THE ONLY WAY

38:21.600 --> 38:24.535
TO GET A SCHOOL FOR HIM
IS IF WE START ONE OURSELVES.

38:30.920 --> 38:31.716
[keyboard clicking]

38:31.750 --> 38:33.229
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- NOTHING.

38:33.270 --> 38:34.999
I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING.
- KRISTINA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

38:35.030 --> 38:36.201
- I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING.

38:36.240 --> 38:39.368
I JUST--JUST HOLD ON
FOR A SECOND.

38:39.420 --> 38:41.888
I MEAN, I'M JUST GONNA CHECK
SOMETHING OUT.

38:41.940 --> 38:43.999
- "HOW TO START A SCHOOL"?
- NOTHING.

38:44.040 --> 38:45.894
I'M NOT DOING THAT.

38:45.940 --> 38:46.861
YOU--
- THAT'S CRAZY.

38:46.910 --> 38:48.286
- IT'S SO INSANE.

38:48.320 --> 38:51.528
IT'S INSANE...
BUT IT ISN'T, IS IT?

38:51.570 --> 38:52.559
- I THINK THAT
THIS LOOKS LIKE A LOT

38:52.600 --> 38:55.114
OF BUREAUCRATIC RED TAPE
AND A WHOLE LOT OF WORK.

38:55.160 --> 38:57.151
- I KNOW,
BUT HOW HARD CAN IT BE?

38:57.190 --> 38:58.327
I MEAN, THINK ABOUT IT.

38:58.370 --> 39:00.679
YOU STARTED A STUDIO,

39:00.710 --> 39:02.189
A RECORDING STUDIO,
RIGHT?

39:02.230 --> 39:03.709
- YES, THAT WAS NOT EASY.
- YEAH.

39:03.750 --> 39:04.364
- AND YOU RAN FOR MAYOR...
- I DID.

39:04.410 --> 39:04.978
- WHICH WAS ALSO NOT EASY.

39:05.030 --> 39:07.123
- NOT EASY, BUT, I MEAN--

39:07.170 --> 39:08.376
- AND, I GUESS,
WHAT DO WE NEED?

39:08.410 --> 39:09.195
