02:14.153 --> 02:19.034
The baby, I'm concerned,
might have some abnormalities.

02:19.114 --> 02:24.076
Outwardly, we can already tell
that the child has no pigmentation.

02:24.195 --> 02:28.315
It's called albinism.
It's strictly genetic.

That's, that's--
Well, that's pale skin, right?

02:30.595 --> 02:35.436
And pale eyes that are
usually more light sensitive.

- Greg, you have to remember
that an unborn child...

02:39.437 --> 02:42.237

that the mother experiences.

- We figure the kid's his grandson.
- So where is he?

06:19.865 --> 06:21.865
He won't come up
from the cellar.

06:21.985 --> 06:26.025
He didn't report
his grandfather's death either.

06:28.825 --> 06:32.106
We already know
he died of natural causes.

06:32.186 --> 06:35.466
Doug, what am I doing here?

06:35.546 --> 06:37.626
The neighbors say
he may be retarded.

06:37.707 --> 06:39.787
One of them says deformed.

06:39.866 --> 06:41.707
You know, physically handicapped.

I don't know.

I couldn't for the life of me
think of who else to call.

He's scared enough,
and I thought maybe you could...

06:48.708 --> 06:52.828
come down and talk him
out of there without us having
to go down and drag him out.

06:52.908 --> 06:58.429
Jessie... the neighbors talk about him
like he's some kind of a phantom.

06:58.509 --> 07:01.389
I haven't met one yet that
ever had a good look at him.

07:01.470 --> 07:04.150
What are you telling me, Doug?

07:04.270 --> 07:07.590
That the old folks
may have kept him down there...

07:07.710 --> 07:11.671
like some kind of a family secret.

07:11.791 --> 07:14.551

- Is that a name or a nickname?
- He was getting coffee and he fell.

08:25.999 --> 08:28.880

He just fell over and died.

08:31.040 --> 08:32.961

you're not in any trouble.

there would be a day...

when he would die...

10:27.695 --> 10:31.016
like Grandma died.

Are you sure you're okay?
[Nervous Laugh]

38:17.264 --> 38:19.105
Do you know how to get
to the interstate?

38:19.184 --> 38:21.865
Yeah, it's um--

38:21.945 --> 38:24.186
If you follow the train tracks,
you'll see the Redmond water tower.

38:24.306 --> 38:27.505
Then, if you go across
the trestle, you'll see it.

38:27.625 --> 38:31.786
- But you're really okay?
- [Softly] I'm okay.

38:33.666 --> 38:35.906
You better hurry.

38:35.987 --> 38:39.827
They catch boys running away
from Central, I hear they get solitary.

38:39.987 --> 38:41.868
Hey!

38:44.148 --> 38:47.549
Stay away from
those electrical outlets, okay?

38:53.869 --> 38:55.669

40:10.478 --> 40:13.759
I didn't know better,
I'd say you were headed for the highway.

40:13.879 --> 40:15.999
Don't make me
come out there, boy.

40:20.640 --> 40:24.920
Now, you're about to make me
a whole lot meaner. Trust me, son,

40:25.040 --> 40:27.560
- you don't want to make me mad.
- Afraid.

40:29.521 --> 40:31.521
I don't make you mad,
I make you afraid.

40:31.641 --> 40:33.321
What was that?

40:33.441 --> 40:36.162
I said that
you're afraid of me.

40:36.322 --> 40:38.882
Duncan, get on back.

40:42.682 --> 40:44.563
I can handle this.

40:51.924 --> 40:54.924
I'm all right.

40:55.043 --> 40:57.484
- I can see that.
- [Jeremy] Then let me go home.

40:57.604 --> 40:59.804
I don't want to go back
to that hospital.

40:59.925 --> 41:03.645
We'll call the doc. If he says okay,
I'll take you back to Central.

41:03.726 --> 41:05.605
Central's not my home.

41:05.725 --> 41:09.806
[Doug] I'm trying to tell you
as nice as I know how.

41:09.926 --> 41:15.006
Now either you come with me
without a fuss or we're gonna
have ourselves a problem.

[Transmission Distorts]
... Doug.

41:44.930 --> 41:47.210
You got a problem
with hospitals in general?

41:47.330 --> 41:49.771
I don't like 'em.

41:49.891 --> 41:53.131
Well, you can put me
on that list.

41:53.251 --> 41:55.772

was in a hospital.

[Door Opens, Closes]

42:00.612 --> 42:04.013
What day was that?

42:04.133 --> 42:06.572
The day I was born.

42:11.854 --> 42:13.934
Let me get this straight, Jeremy.

42:13.974 --> 42:18.214
You said that you've never been tested
for I. Q. before. Is that right?

42:18.295 --> 42:20.615
And your grandmother tutored you.

42:20.695 --> 42:23.335
Did she ever say
anything about it?

42:23.415 --> 42:25.575
She said I was a fast learner.

42:25.655 --> 42:27.495
[Laughs] Yeah.

42:27.575 --> 42:30.696
Well, I think that's about to fall
into the "no shit" category.

- [Jessie]
These men and women are here...

Miss Caldwell says you're
a very unique young man, Jeremy.

43:04.940 --> 43:09.261
Hmm.
She also tells me that, um,

43:09.341 --> 43:13.701
reading and your grandparents are the
only ways you've experienced the world.

43:13.781 --> 43:15.901
Is that true?

43:17.782 --> 43:21.942
What about a radio
or, um, a TV set?

43:22.062 --> 43:24.543
- Surely you've watched some
television at some point.
- He probably couldn't.

43:24.663 --> 43:27.743
Didn't your grandparents
have a TV set, Jeremy?

43:27.863 --> 43:30.544
I could never watch television.

43:32.504 --> 43:34.544
- Are you saying you weren't allowed?
- Here, it probably just makes--

43:43.025 --> 43:46.186
I'm saying I could
never watch television.

43:46.265 --> 43:49.666
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
That was-- That was my fault.

43:49.786 --> 43:52.666
l, uh-- I was-- I was just
trying to make them understand.

43:52.747 --> 43:55.987
What the good doctor hasn't, uh,
let you in on yet is that...

43:56.067 --> 43:59.628
- your test shows that you're a genius.
- [Stipler] Please!

43:59.707 --> 44:03.748
Your I. Q. scored right
off the charts, Jeremy.

44:03.868 --> 44:07.628
There isn't even a classification
for you, it was so high.

44:11.469 --> 44:14.509
All of your tests indicate that you have
the most advanced intellect...

44:14.589 --> 44:17.870
in the history of humankind.

44:17.949 --> 44:20.270
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

44:20.350 --> 44:24.191
If you thought I was that advanced,
would you ask me if I understood?

- [Chuckles]
- [Jessie] Jeremy,

44:27.470 --> 44:29.951
these people are
in a position to help you.

44:30.031 --> 44:32.911
Can they send me home?

44:32.991 --> 44:35.991
- Can they send me back?
- No.

44:36.072 --> 44:39.392
I'm sorry. They can't.
The fact is, the...

44:39.472 --> 44:41.953
the farm's in probate.

44:42.073 --> 44:45.113
Do you know what that means?

44:45.193 --> 44:49.553
Of or pertaining to probate or a court
of probate, exempli gratia...

44:49.633 --> 44:53.393
the official proving of a will
as authentic or genuine.

44:53.474 --> 44:57.634
Or it can also mean the official,
certified copy of a will so proved.

44:57.754 --> 45:00.595
Right.

45:00.674 --> 45:03.555
Well, it-it seems that

- Jeremy.
- You're not here to ask me questions.

45:15.916 --> 45:18.276

how I cheated.

That's the only way
you can make sense of it.

- [Lights Flickering]
- That's what you need to believe.

45:26.478 --> 45:29.159
But I don't need you
to believe in me, Dr. Stipler.

45:29.279 --> 45:33.239
- [Lights Flickering]
- And I'm not interested
in any of your tests.

want to come up here.

Jeremy, are you okay?

01:17:09.356 --> 01:17:11.277
They're wondering if I killed her.

So that's what they'd see
if they could?

01:18:33.566 --> 01:18:35.527
That they're connected?

01:18:38.367 --> 01:18:40.248

scared in the dark,
I had this feeling that...

01:35:35.735 --> 01:35:39.415
that you would change
everything I knew.

01:35:39.574 --> 01:35:42.215
And maybe...

01:35:42.335 --> 01:35:46.696
this is not the right place
for someone as beautiful as you.

01:35:46.816 --> 01:35:49.416

your head and please, please...
