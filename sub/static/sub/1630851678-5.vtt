00:30.378 --> 00:32.206
Really, <i>
Science Mag Monthly?</i>

00:32.249 --> 00:35.078
Not one article about
interdimensional portals!

00:35.122 --> 00:37.907
There's absolutely nothing!
What science do you even do?

00:39.952 --> 00:42.520
Relax, Anne.
We'll find a way back.

00:42.564 --> 00:44.348
Eventually.

00:44.392 --> 00:46.481
Oh, you don't have
to do that.

00:46.524 --> 00:48.570
Please,
you're our guest.

00:48.613 --> 00:50.137
What's that
high-pitched beeping?

00:50.180 --> 00:51.877
My canapÃ©s!

00:51.921 --> 00:55.577
Whoo! I haven't been
this pampered in ages.

00:55.620 --> 00:56.578
Hear! Hear!

00:56.621 --> 00:58.232
Enjoy it now,
kids.

00:58.275 --> 01:01.148
"Guests are like noxious
swamp gas.

01:01.191 --> 01:03.802
After three days,
they start to drive you crazy."

01:03.846 --> 01:05.587
We've already
been here two days.

01:05.630 --> 01:08.459
Pretty soon
we'll have to start
pulling our own weight.

01:08.503 --> 01:10.418
Hop Pop, we've been here
for a whole week.

01:13.769 --> 01:16.511
No! That means we're not
just guests anymore.

01:16.554 --> 01:20.906
We're freeloaders!
Just like Cousin Stanley!

01:22.082 --> 01:24.171
Well, I'm sort
of family now, so...
Who?

01:24.214 --> 01:26.042
He was the worst.

01:26.086 --> 01:27.739
<i>He stayed forever.</i>

01:27.783 --> 01:29.393
<i>Ate all our snacks.</i>

01:29.437 --> 01:31.526
<i>Even used my bucket
as a footbath.</i>

01:31.569 --> 01:34.833
<i>I don't even think
he was really our cousin.</i>

01:34.877 --> 01:38.010
<i>But we were hosts,
so we had to be nice.</i>

01:39.577 --> 01:43.190
<i>We just resented him
a little more each day.</i>

01:44.582 --> 01:48.369
Thankfully, he eventually
left peacefully on his own.

01:48.412 --> 01:50.284
Just kidding.
We threw him out the window.

01:50.327 --> 01:52.199
- Whoa! What?

01:52.242 --> 01:57.073
Exactly. And I can only imagine
what the Boonchuys wanna do
to us by now.

01:57.117 --> 02:00.076
We got to find a way
to contribute
to this household.

02:00.120 --> 02:02.165
Hey, Anne. It's time for
your dentist appointment.

02:02.209 --> 02:03.297
My what?

02:03.340 --> 02:05.168
You have been missing
for five months.

02:05.212 --> 02:07.257
And I have a feeling
you haven't been brushing.

02:07.301 --> 02:08.867
Oh! But, Mom!

02:08.911 --> 02:11.000
I'm supposed to
take Domino
to the vet today.

02:11.043 --> 02:12.393
Maybe your father
could take her.

02:12.436 --> 02:15.178
No can do.
I'm working at
the restaurant today.

02:15.222 --> 02:16.832
Oh, well. Hmm.

02:16.875 --> 02:18.399
Hmm.

02:18.442 --> 02:21.228
- We'll take the cat to the vet!
- Really? Are you sure?

02:21.271 --> 02:22.446
Yeah, I'm sure.

02:22.490 --> 02:24.535
It's the least
we can do to help.

02:24.579 --> 02:26.581
You guys are lifesavers!

02:26.624 --> 02:28.235
Here's the address
to the vet.

02:28.278 --> 02:30.454
If anyone suspects
anything froggy about you,

02:30.498 --> 02:32.543
just say,
"Boy, I could use
some coffee."

02:32.587 --> 02:34.763
It's, like, code
for "I'm human."

02:34.806 --> 02:35.807
Thanks, guys.

02:35.851 --> 02:37.374
And I'll be heading
to the restaurant.

02:37.418 --> 02:40.247
If anything go wrong,
just give me a call.

02:40.290 --> 02:42.597
Sweet. Burner.

02:42.640 --> 02:45.339
Mom, please.
My teeth only hurt
a little bit.

02:46.470 --> 02:48.342
Have fun with Domino, guys.

02:49.691 --> 02:53.434
Wow! Our first
solo Earth mission
without Anne.

02:53.477 --> 02:56.263
Big stuff.
Do you really think
we'll be all right?

02:56.306 --> 02:59.396
Sure. Now, let's get
that cat to the vet.

02:59.440 --> 03:00.441
Yeah!

03:02.486 --> 03:04.445
Looks easy enough.

03:04.488 --> 03:07.361
I'm having Domino 2 flashbacks
right about now.

03:07.404 --> 03:10.233
Enough talk.
Seize the beast! Hyah!

03:12.409 --> 03:15.369
Oh, my frog! It's got claws!

03:15.412 --> 03:17.240
Blood!
There's blood everywhere!

03:17.284 --> 03:20.461
Well, we survived that.

03:20.504 --> 03:21.375
Help me.

03:21.418 --> 03:22.854
Now all we have to do

03:22.898 --> 03:24.900
is take this bus to the vet.

03:26.423 --> 03:28.382
Okay. We can do this.

03:28.425 --> 03:31.428
Just blend in and do
whatever these people do.

03:40.481 --> 03:42.526
Thank you,
kind Earth man.

03:42.570 --> 03:43.832
Wow. Dirty.

03:43.875 --> 03:45.703
Takin' the bus.
Done.

03:45.747 --> 03:47.096
That wasn't that hard.

03:48.184 --> 03:50.404
Whoa!

03:55.365 --> 03:57.889
Wow, Hop Pop!
Great tongue action.

03:57.933 --> 04:00.109
I take a kickin'
and keep on lickin'.

04:00.152 --> 04:01.415
Ew!

04:01.458 --> 04:02.503
Did that creepy old man

04:02.546 --> 04:04.331
just lick everyone
on the bus?

04:04.374 --> 04:06.202
What do you have to say
for yourself, dude?

04:06.246 --> 04:09.031
Boy, I could use some coffee?

04:10.598 --> 04:12.339
Well, that went well.

04:12.382 --> 04:15.994
So, what do we do?
Maybe Mr. Boonchuy
can give us a ride?

04:16.038 --> 04:17.344
Absolutely not!

04:17.387 --> 04:19.563
We're not asking
for any more favors.

04:19.607 --> 04:23.480
We just need to focus up
and get this job done.

04:23.524 --> 04:24.960
Ow!

04:28.398 --> 04:30.313
Sprig!

04:46.024 --> 04:47.156
Hey, buddy.

04:47.199 --> 04:48.331
Who wants a treat?

04:52.988 --> 04:54.772
Hooray!

05:07.089 --> 05:09.134
Has anyone seen
my snake Bobbit?

05:09.178 --> 05:12.137
That's a good boy.

05:12.181 --> 05:13.965
No way.

05:14.009 --> 05:15.315
Our brethren.

05:20.537 --> 05:22.931
Domino.
Uh, appointment
for Domino.

05:22.974 --> 05:23.758
That's us!

05:25.020 --> 05:26.500
Oh. Domino looks
healthy enough.

05:26.543 --> 05:29.503
Uh, a little on edge.
Do you three have
any other questions for me?

05:29.546 --> 05:33.507
Yes, actually.
Do you know anything
about frog biology?

05:33.550 --> 05:36.292
What do you want to know?
What would you say
to an older frog

05:36.336 --> 05:38.729
who's complaining
about back pain
these days?

05:38.773 --> 05:40.383
Uh, a frog complain?

05:40.427 --> 05:42.820
Well, honestly,
he holds it in and soldiers on.

05:42.864 --> 05:44.518
He's noble like that.

05:44.561 --> 05:46.607
Shush, Hop Pop.
What we really want to know

05:46.650 --> 05:49.000
is what's the highest
a frog has ever jumped?

05:49.044 --> 05:50.524
Does it seem beatable?

05:50.567 --> 05:54.049
Frogs are more known
for the length of their jumps
than height.

05:54.092 --> 05:55.616
Give me numbers, man!

05:55.659 --> 05:58.183
Can a frog
grow multiple limbs?

05:58.227 --> 06:01.056
Could there be hypothetically
an uber-frog?

06:01.099 --> 06:04.625
Do you have any medication
that can make a frog look
40 years younger?

06:04.668 --> 06:07.279
I-- Do you have
a 40-year-old frog?

06:07.323 --> 06:10.674
You know, you have
very interesting skin, sir.
And is that a fake nose?

06:10.718 --> 06:13.808
Uh! I could sure use
some coffee.

06:13.851 --> 06:15.287
Come on, kids,
let's skedaddle.

06:17.855 --> 06:19.988
Let's get this cat
back home.

06:23.600 --> 06:25.820
Excuse me.
Have you seen my frog?

06:25.863 --> 06:28.344
We did it!
We aren't freeloaders!

06:28.388 --> 06:31.347
Yep. We finally
earned our keep.

06:31.391 --> 06:33.349
Feels good, don't it?

06:33.393 --> 06:35.307
Even Domino seems happy with us.

06:35.351 --> 06:37.658
She hasn't tried
to scratch me once
since we left the vet.

06:37.701 --> 06:39.747
And she feels
so much lighter too.

06:43.620 --> 06:44.926
She's gone?

06:44.969 --> 06:47.145
We lost her!
We lost Domino!

06:47.189 --> 06:48.930
Anne's gonna be devastated!

06:48.973 --> 06:50.584
I'm calling for backup!

06:50.627 --> 06:52.281
That's the last thing
we should do!

06:52.324 --> 06:54.544
Quickly.
Let's retrace our steps.

06:54.588 --> 06:55.893
She couldn't have gotten far.

06:55.937 --> 06:57.112
Domino!

06:57.155 --> 06:58.679
Domino, where are you?

06:58.722 --> 07:01.464
I found this guy.
Think Anne'll know
the difference?

07:03.074 --> 07:04.641
Okay. Everything's fine.

07:04.685 --> 07:06.513
Nobody panic.
We can figure this out.

07:06.556 --> 07:09.690
We still don't have to resort
to calling Mr. Boonchuy.

07:09.733 --> 07:11.474
- Hello, Mr. Boonchuy?
- No!

07:13.868 --> 07:15.696
<i>Hello? Sprig?
Something wrong?</i>

07:15.739 --> 07:17.698
Nothing's wrong.
Body slam!

07:18.394 --> 07:19.569
Uh-huh. Yeah.

07:19.613 --> 07:22.877
Yeah, we lost the cat.
Okay. "Sha-war-ma."

07:22.920 --> 07:25.575
Got it. Thanks, Mr. Boonchuy.
You're the best.

07:27.708 --> 07:29.100
Boy, what's goin' on?

07:29.144 --> 07:31.886
He said Domino would be at
the nearest shawarma restaurant.

07:31.929 --> 07:35.759
I guess it's her favorite food.
He also said he was on his way
to help find her.

07:35.803 --> 07:38.109
We gotta find that cat
before he gets here.

07:38.153 --> 07:39.981
It's the only way
to salvage this.

07:40.024 --> 07:41.722
Polly, put that thing back!

07:41.765 --> 07:45.508
Aw! But his face is frozen
in a horrible smile.

07:48.163 --> 07:49.991
Goodbye, my friend.

07:50.034 --> 07:51.514
"Hoppy" trails.

07:53.777 --> 07:54.996
Whoo-hoo!

07:57.564 --> 07:59.653
Just look at that kid go.

07:59.696 --> 08:03.091
I don't know where
this kitty came from,
but I am keeping her forever.

08:03.134 --> 08:05.746
She's a shawarma-loving
customer magnet!

08:05.789 --> 08:08.531
He wouldn't think it was so cute
if he knew where
her mouth had been.

08:08.575 --> 08:10.925
We've got to get that cat
at any cost.

08:10.968 --> 08:13.318
We may have to give our lives.

08:13.362 --> 08:17.279
Don't be silly, Hop Pop.
All we need is a distraction.

08:18.715 --> 08:20.891
Hey, isn't that one
of those alarmy thingies?

08:20.935 --> 08:24.591
Hop Pop, think you
can make a high-pitched
sirenesque screech?

08:25.200 --> 08:27.594
My time has come.

08:28.812 --> 08:31.336
Aw, nuts! Everybody out!
There's a fire!

08:31.380 --> 08:32.903
But I'm still waiting
for my order.

08:32.947 --> 08:35.602
The shawarma's good,
but is it worth
your life, Karen?

08:35.645 --> 08:37.386
My name's Emily,
but point taken.

08:39.040 --> 08:39.997
Now, kids!

08:40.998 --> 08:41.956
Whup!
Ow!

08:47.614 --> 08:51.574
Hey, Domino... have some yarn.

09:04.326 --> 09:05.849
Gotcha!

09:05.893 --> 09:06.937
Whoo!

09:09.636 --> 09:11.551
Time to go, frogs.
Come on!

09:14.684 --> 09:16.730
Thanks for bailing us out,
Mr. B.

09:16.773 --> 09:18.819
Yeah. You're a real lifesaver.

09:18.862 --> 09:22.387
Don't mention it.
I'll drop you three off on
my way back to the restaurant.

09:22.431 --> 09:26.087
Oh! Once again,
we inconvenience you.

09:26.130 --> 09:29.612
How you must resent
us freeloaders.

09:29.656 --> 09:31.222
What? Freeloaders?

09:32.920 --> 09:34.835
You three took my daughter
into your home

09:34.878 --> 09:36.271
when she needed it most.

09:36.314 --> 09:38.752
You kept her fed and safe
for five months

09:38.795 --> 09:40.884
just out of the kindness
of your heart.

09:40.928 --> 09:43.191
You will never owe us anything.

09:43.234 --> 09:44.235
Ever.

09:44.279 --> 09:46.194
Wow, I...

09:46.237 --> 09:47.891
...don't know what to say.

09:47.935 --> 09:48.805
Thank you.

09:48.849 --> 09:51.678
Are you kidding?
Thank you.

09:55.812 --> 09:58.685
Anne, you're back!
Everything went great
with Domino.

09:58.728 --> 10:03.037
You guys
are everywhere. Okay?

10:03.080 --> 10:04.212
Eh?

10:04.255 --> 10:07.258
Eight cavities
and a whole lot of cricket legs.

10:07.302 --> 10:10.566
Ooh! Cricket legs?
Did you save us any?

10:10.610 --> 10:13.569
Listen,
Domino is not just a cat.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.440
She's the alpha and omega.

10:15.484 --> 10:19.227
An interdimensional being
beyond all time and space.

10:19.270 --> 10:21.708
W-What's that now?
Do me next! Do me next!

10:21.751 --> 10:24.449
Hey. Do you guys
actually wanna keep her
occupied for a bit?

10:24.493 --> 10:26.364
Because that'd
be super helpful.

10:26.408 --> 10:27.365
Thanks!

10:27.409 --> 10:30.542
Okay. Can you
let go of my face?

10:30.586 --> 10:33.415
Never. We are one.
