You know, it's weird.

10:14.481 --> 10:16.281
We haven't seen
a single cable car.

10:16.283 --> 10:19.150
Focus. We're only
interested in Shego's car.

10:19.152 --> 10:22.153
I mean, this is San Francisco.

10:22.155 --> 10:24.222
Is one lousy cable car
too much to ask?

10:24.224 --> 10:26.691
Finally. There's one.

10:26.693 --> 10:29.327
Aah! There's one!

10:34.233 --> 10:35.500
Gadget, gadget.

Got to be a gadget.

Why isn't there a gadget?!

11:04.196 --> 11:05.230
Uhh!
Uhh!

11:05.232 --> 11:06.231
Jim, Tim, did you add

11:06.233 --> 11:07.866
aquatic capability to my car?

11:07.868 --> 11:09.200
Sure.

11:09.202 --> 11:11.469
Hit it, Ron.

11:13.472 --> 11:15.774
Ok. Which button?

11:15.776 --> 11:17.809
Both: For what?
Aquatic capability.

11:17.811 --> 11:19.244
Oh. We thought you said,

11:19.246 --> 11:21.913
could you add
aquatic capability?

11:21.915 --> 11:24.783
Oh, I can see how they'd
make that mistake.

I cannot believe Kimmy
cracked our caper.

someplace she cannot get to.

11:33.260 --> 11:34.826
Right. Like, where?

11:34.828 --> 11:36.361
What about way up a Mountain,

11:36.363 --> 11:38.963
and then past all sorts
of booby traps.

11:38.965 --> 11:40.665
Hmm. What's the take-away?

K.P., it's the zoo!

They tried to feed me
to the lions!

Are you sure you didn't
just mess this up?

12:15.001 --> 12:15.967
Well, I...

12:15.969 --> 12:19.904
And, you know, I brought
my own raw meat from home

12:19.906 --> 12:22.974

large on the Internet.

we can hitch a ride with.

his humble coupons

17:02.822 --> 17:04.188

through in a pinch.

all this racket?

are you doing here?

Rescue us? From what?

19:55.161 --> 19:57.061

Including
his own father. Hi.

Well, you see, the thing is...

20:03.469 --> 20:05.303
Yes, it is true!

20:05.305 --> 20:08.039
What is wrong
with that boy of yours?

20:08.041 --> 20:11.209
There's only one word
for behavior like that,

20:11.211 --> 20:12.944
it's downright evil.

20:12.946 --> 20:14.812
Yes, quite evil indeed.

20:14.814 --> 20:16.347
Well done, junior.

20:16.349 --> 20:18.015
I'm very proud of you, my son.

20:18.017 --> 20:20.818
Thank you, father,
and Happy Birthday!

20:20.820 --> 20:24.956
Ah, what a marvelously
thoughtful gift.

20:26.091 --> 20:28.125
What is she doing here?

20:28.127 --> 20:31.128
Junior came up with
this one all on his own.

20:31.130 --> 20:32.997
It was actually a good plan.

20:32.999 --> 20:35.433
And... It still is.

20:35.435 --> 20:37.335
Hah!

20:39.238 --> 20:41.205
Ha ha ha!

20:42.941 --> 20:45.209
Guys. Still in danger!

20:45.211 --> 20:46.744
Hey, stop that!

20:46.746 --> 20:48.746
Give it up, Shego.
It's over.

20:48.748 --> 20:51.215
Yes. You saw how pleased
father was with his gift.

20:51.217 --> 20:52.283
We can stop now.

20:52.285 --> 20:53.951
Ohh. Oh, no, no, no.

21:18.244 --> 21:19.777
Anyone?

21:19.779 --> 21:21.512
These things have teeth!

21:21.514 --> 21:23.547
I like to reward people
who save my life.

21:23.549 --> 21:26.117
And I like to be
rewarded. [Giggles]

21:26.119 --> 21:27.385
Did you hear that, K.P.?
A reward!

21:27.387 --> 21:29.186
How would you like a job?

21:29.188 --> 21:33.958
Maybe we have different
thoughts on that word reward.

21:33.960 --> 21:35.826
Ow! Oh, right.

21:35.828 --> 21:37.161
A job. Yeah.

21:37.163 --> 21:40.131
That'd be good.
Wow. Thanks.

21:40.133 --> 21:42.333
You are the type
of go-getter I need

21:42.335 --> 21:45.936
on the smarty mart team.
Welcome aboard.

21:48.040 --> 21:49.006
[Animal noises]

21:49.008 --> 21:50.541
I won't let you down, sir.

21:50.543 --> 21:54.078
Well, Rufus,
let's meet our coworkers.

21:54.080 --> 21:56.080
[Animal noises]

21:56.848 --> 21:58.316
Wow. Chez expensive.

21:58.318 --> 22:00.518
And this time, no coupons.

22:00.520 --> 22:05.056
Tonight, garcon, we'll
take the grown-up menu.

22:05.058 --> 22:06.390
Ron, this is really great.

22:06.392 --> 22:11.262
But do you have to wear
the smarty mart vest?

22:11.264 --> 22:14.065
K.P., the vest
never comes off.

22:14.067 --> 22:17.068
Now, where
are my crayons? Garcon!

22:17.070 --> 22:18.035
Garcon!

22:18.037 --> 22:20.071
Ha! Garcon!

22:23.108 --> 22:25.142
I got this great idea
for the perfect caper.

22:25.144 --> 22:26.010
Do you want to hear it?
No.

22:26.012 --> 22:27.445
Ok. Here's what you do.

22:27.447 --> 22:29.080
You demand an enormous
amount of money

22:29.082 --> 22:32.483
for the safe return of the
richest people in the world.

22:32.485 --> 22:35.152
Luker, lights out
means lips shut.

22:35.154 --> 22:37.054
Ok, I'm just spit balling,
but here's the twist.

22:37.056 --> 22:38.489
You don't actually
abduct anyone.

22:38.491 --> 22:42.993
No. No, you just make people
think you're holding them.

22:42.995 --> 22:44.095
Are you sleep talking?

22:44.097 --> 22:46.163
Ok. Ok. How about this...
