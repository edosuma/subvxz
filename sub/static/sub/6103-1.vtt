01:10.850 --> 01:13.815
<i>Long ago, in a land far away,</i>

01:13.980 --> 01:18.540
<i>there once rose an empire,
that stretched from the steppes of China,</i>

01:18.779 --> 01:22.058
<i>to the shores of the Mediterranean.</i>

01:23.577 --> 01:27.622
<i>That empire was Persia.</i>

01:27.834 --> 01:31.719
<i>Fierce in battle,
wise in victory,</i>

01:31.923 --> 01:35.603
<i>where the Persian sword went,
order followed.</i>

01:36.597 --> 01:39.477
<i>The Persian King Sharaman,</i>

01:39.644 --> 01:46.643
<i>ruled with his brother Nizam
upon the principles of loyalty and brotherhood.</i>

01:46.982 --> 01:50.375
<i>The King had two sons
who gave him great joy.</i>

01:50.523 --> 01:51.973
Rejoice!

01:52.037 --> 01:57.637
<i>But in the eyes of the gods,
the King's family was not yet complete.</i>

01:58.798 --> 02:02.397
<i>Not until the day he
witnessed a single act of courage</i>

02:02.594 --> 02:06.154
<i>by an orphan boy
from the streets of Nasaf.</i>

02:06.350 --> 02:09.030
Get out of the way!

02:17.409 --> 02:20.408
Stop!
Stop!

02:25.838 --> 02:27.838
Run!

02:27.961 --> 02:29.926
Run, Bis!
Run!

02:35.352 --> 02:37.352
Stay here.

03:09.387 --> 03:11.087
He's getting away!

03:14.745 --> 03:17.144
Let go of me!

03:21.421 --> 03:24.861
In the King's name!

03:31.353 --> 03:35.033
- What is your name, boy?
- Dastan, Sir.

03:35.234 --> 03:38.233
And your parents?

03:41.576 --> 03:44.096
Boy...

03:47.711 --> 03:49.711
Brother, take him up.

03:49.839 --> 03:54.838
<i>Moved by what he saw, the King
adopted the boy Dastan into his family.</i>

03:55.889 --> 03:58.574
<i>A son with no royal blood,</i>

03:58.727 --> 04:01.452
<i>and no eye on his throne.</i>

04:01.606 --> 04:05.326
<i>But perhaps, there was something
else that worked that day.</i>

04:05.524 --> 04:08.769
<i>Something beyond simple understanding.</i>

04:09.953 --> 04:13.952
<i>The day, a boy from
the unlikeliest of places,</i>

04:14.161 --> 04:16.611
<i>became...</i>

04:16.754 --> 04:20.113
<i>a Prince of Persia.</i>

04:58.984 --> 05:01.864
The fabled Alamut,
even more stunning than I imagine.

05:02.031 --> 05:04.796
Don't be fooled by its beauty prince Tates.
It's a city like any others.

05:04.952 --> 05:08.752
Soft countries make soft men.
They stooped to treachery, and now must pay for it.

05:08.953 --> 05:11.563
The father made clear,
Alamut is not to be touched.

05:11.712 --> 05:15.311
Some consider it sacred.
But since our wise father isn't here,

05:15.504 --> 05:17.634
the decision rests with me.

05:17.762 --> 05:21.162
I'll have one last counsel
with my noble uncle,

05:21.346 --> 05:25.191
and my two brothers,
trusted Garsiv, and...

05:27.695 --> 05:29.660
Where's Dastan?

05:29.781 --> 05:32.260
Come on! I bet my entire month's
allowance on this!

05:32.404 --> 05:34.849
- This is embarrassing!
- Why don't you give it a try?

05:34.997 --> 05:37.477
Give it in here!

05:40.213 --> 05:42.693
Is that all you got?

05:46.765 --> 05:48.765
Prince Dastan!

05:49.561 --> 05:51.680
Where's prince Dastan?

05:51.808 --> 05:54.053
Prince Dastan isn't here.

05:54.192 --> 05:58.072
Your Highness, please.
Prince Tus has convened the war council.

05:58.277 --> 06:00.842
I'm on my way.

06:03.331 --> 06:09.650
Our finest spy, intercepted
a caravan leaving Alamut.

06:10.675 --> 06:13.555
Swords, of the best workmanship.

06:14.431 --> 06:16.796
Steel tipped arrows.

06:16.935 --> 06:21.215
A promise of payment from the
Warlord Kosh, to Alamut.

06:21.437 --> 06:23.967
They're selling weapons
to our enemies, Dastan.

06:24.113 --> 06:26.433
An arrow such as this
slew my horse in Kushkan.

06:26.570 --> 06:28.780
Blood will run
in Alamut's streets for this.

06:28.911 --> 06:31.476
Or our soldiers will fall
from its walls.

06:31.623 --> 06:35.583
Our orders were to subdue Kushkan,
not to attack Alamut.

06:35.791 --> 06:39.716
- Wise words, little brother.
- Words won't stop our enemies,

06:39.923 --> 06:43.088
once they're armed
with Alamutian blades.

06:57.412 --> 07:00.092
We attack at dawn.

07:02.003 --> 07:04.883
Well, if that's your decision,
then let me go in first.

07:05.759 --> 07:08.638
- Who wants to share, Garsiv?
- I'll ride at the head of the Persian Army!

07:08.799 --> 07:11.129
Dastan leads the company
of street rabble!

07:11.266 --> 07:14.031
They may not be much for manners,
but they're pretty handy in a fight.

07:14.187 --> 07:18.107
- The honor of first blood should be mine.
- Garsiv, you've got your hands on your sword again.

07:18.314 --> 07:21.639
- Where's it should be.
- Oh, my brothers...

07:21.824 --> 07:23.904
Ever eager.

07:24.412 --> 07:29.011
It's said the princess of Alamut,
is a beauty without equal.

07:29.836 --> 07:33.716
We'll march into her palace
and see for ourselves.

07:35.970 --> 07:41.010
There'll be no doubt of your courage
Dastan, but you're not ready for this.

07:42.230 --> 07:45.350
Garsiv's cavalry will lead the way.

08:01.008 --> 08:06.207
Princess Tamina, the Persian Army
my princess, has not moved on.

08:07.184 --> 08:12.384
Their faith has little love
for any truth, other than its own.

08:12.645 --> 08:16.530
Or perhaps it would be safer
if you didn't stand so close.

08:16.782 --> 08:19.982
Whatever their faith,
their bows aren't that strong,

08:20.157 --> 08:22.442
Nor it's their aim.

08:22.577 --> 08:24.586
Gather the council.

08:24.710 --> 08:27.990
Tell them, I sit in the High Temple,
I must pray.

08:28.173 --> 08:32.253
The High Temple? Alamut hasn't been
breached in a thousand years.

08:32.467 --> 08:35.317
Everything changes with time.

08:35.477 --> 08:37.477
We should know this
best of all.

08:43.989 --> 08:46.194
Remind me why we're
disobeying your brother's orders?

08:46.326 --> 08:50.806
Because Garsiv only knows how
to attack head-on, it would be a massacre.

08:52.252 --> 08:55.252
The Alamutians would be busy
with the main gate, so we slip through the side.

09:24.466 --> 09:26.706
Have you been drinking?

10:06.738 --> 10:09.818
That's our way in.
There are two gates.

10:09.993 --> 10:13.638
The outer one's easy,
it's the inner gate that's impossible.

10:13.833 --> 10:17.433
That gate mechanism
is protected by two men gard towers.

10:18.215 --> 10:20.934
Yeah, there's always a way in, Bis,
you take care of the outer gate,

10:21.052 --> 10:23.051
you leave the impossible one to me.

10:23.174 --> 10:25.439
That's how you won't be
happy if you get us all killed.

10:25.538 --> 10:27.237
Oh. Wonderful speech, Bis.

10:27.348 --> 10:29.593
Rousing!

10:40.122 --> 10:42.202
Sound the alarm!

11:15.592 --> 11:17.672
Hold this.

12:01.494 --> 12:03.694
Watch your back.

12:15.558 --> 12:18.197
- Eastern gate's open.
- That's Dastan's men.

12:18.728 --> 12:21.808
He's gotten in, Dastan's done it.

12:22.234 --> 12:25.694
Redeploy to the eastern gate.

12:25.880 --> 12:29.305
Redeploy to the eastern gate!

13:00.458 --> 13:02.503
They breached the eastern gate.

13:02.628 --> 13:05.828
- Collapse the passages to the chamber.
- Princess.

13:07.218 --> 13:10.498
Go now, everyone.

15:17.914 --> 15:22.954
- You know what you must do.
- Our wealth must be kept safe.

15:42.660 --> 15:45.340
Out of the way!

17:12.377 --> 17:15.858
Silly songs and scented smoke
could do little for you now!

17:16.050 --> 17:20.530
I think you'll find there's more
to her than that, hey Garsiv?!

17:34.286 --> 17:37.566
So for once, the stories are true.

17:39.210 --> 17:42.410
We know you secretly build
weapons for enemies of Persia.

17:43.800 --> 17:46.645
- Now show us where.
- We have no forges here.

17:46.805 --> 17:48.885
And what weapons we had
you overcame.

17:49.016 --> 17:51.576
Our spies say differently.
You can save a lot of pain...

17:51.729 --> 17:55.409
All the pain in the world will not help
you find something that does not exist.

17:55.605 --> 18:00.050
Spoken like one wise enough
to consider a political solution.

18:01.202 --> 18:05.881
- Join hands with Persia's future King.
- I'll die first.

18:15.306 --> 18:17.386
That can be arranged.

18:17.513 --> 18:20.078
Don't!

18:31.121 --> 18:33.961
Prince Tus...

18:39.468 --> 18:45.987
Promise me, the people of Alamut
will be treated with mercy.

18:55.867 --> 18:59.347
Hey, the Lion of Persia!
The Lion of Persia!

18:59.540 --> 19:02.499
They're calling you
the Lion of Persia.

19:03.169 --> 19:06.734
You've never excelled
at following order, Dastan.

19:06.925 --> 19:10.605
- I have some explaining to do, Tus. I...
- No, no.

19:12.434 --> 19:16.919
No, you have some celebrating to do.
There is however, tradition.

19:17.149 --> 19:22.228
Since you took the honor
of first assault, you owe me a gift, homage.

19:24.535 --> 19:28.175
- A beautiful dagger.
- He delivered you the city and its princess,

19:28.369 --> 19:31.091
- I think that's homage enough.
- I suppose it is.

19:31.210 --> 19:34.497
First dispatches just arrived, my prince.
Wonderful news.

19:34.676 --> 19:38.676
Your father's interrupted his prayers
in the eastern palace to join us.

19:39.808 --> 19:42.808
No doubt to commend this
on our great victory.

20:02.759 --> 20:05.504
We've had indications that Alamut
was arming our enemies.

20:05.624 --> 20:11.358
Indications? You've got to have
more than indications to occupy a holy city,

20:11.607 --> 20:13.606
with my troops!

20:13.729 --> 20:18.893
This adventure, won't sit
with our allies!

20:19.153 --> 20:22.798
But I suppose
you didn't take that into account.

20:22.998 --> 20:26.643
Don't look for your uncle, boy!

20:26.837 --> 20:30.557
The decisions and its consequences
rest with me.

20:37.394 --> 20:41.874
I know you're eager to wear the crown.
But trust me when I tell you, you're not yet ready.

20:48.411 --> 20:52.131
No man would know better
than you, father.

20:55.297 --> 20:58.296
Because your trust
is something I deeply cherish.

20:58.467 --> 21:01.427
I'll oversee the search for
weapons myself.

21:01.597 --> 21:06.477
I vow I will not stand before you
until I hold proof for Alamut's treachery.

21:36.650 --> 21:39.650
The third step is the hardest!

21:39.816 --> 21:42.141
Brother!

21:42.284 --> 21:48.164
We've uncovered signs of tunnels on the
eastern edge of the city. I'm on my way there now.

21:48.455 --> 21:50.900
Oh, you'll miss the banquet!

21:51.047 --> 21:53.527
You and Garsiv can handle father
in my absence.

21:53.671 --> 21:57.035
- You do have a gift to honor him with.
- Of course.

21:57.217 --> 22:00.347
Bis, gift!

22:00.519 --> 22:03.119
It's been momentarily misplaced!

22:03.268 --> 22:05.798
I knew you'd forget.

22:05.944 --> 22:08.709
The prayer robe of Alamut's regent.

22:08.866 --> 22:13.345
The holiest in Eastern lands,
a gift the King would appreciate.

22:13.956 --> 22:18.356
You fought like a champion for me,
Dastan. Glad to return the favor.

22:21.175 --> 22:24.975
A rare jewel. Present her
to the King for me this evening, Dastan.

22:26.058 --> 22:29.378
Sure you really want another
wife, brother?

22:30.565 --> 22:33.244
Listen to me, Dastan!

22:33.402 --> 22:37.482
A marriage to the princess
assures me the loyalty of her people.

22:37.695 --> 22:41.225
Unbound to us,
she's a dangerous liability.

22:41.414 --> 22:47.694
If father doesn't approve our union,
I want you to end her life with your own hand.

22:56.437 --> 23:00.602
So, I'm escorted by prince Dastan,
the Lion of Persia.

23:00.818 --> 23:04.698
Must feel wonderful winning such a claim
for destroying such an innocent city.

23:04.908 --> 23:07.268
Oh, a pleasure to meet you too, princess.

23:07.412 --> 23:10.397
And allow me to offer,
that if punishing the enemies of my king

23:10.527 --> 23:12.620
is a crime, then it's one I'll gladly repeat.

23:12.747 --> 23:16.792
Then you are a true prince of Persia.
Brutal. Without honor.

23:17.009 --> 23:20.849
Don't make the mistake
of thinking you know me, princess.

23:21.052 --> 23:24.857
- Oh, and what more is there?
- Wait here with Her Highness.

23:26.065 --> 23:29.185
If you can manage it.

23:30.029 --> 23:33.228
I suggest a hint of humility
when you're presented to the King.

23:33.403 --> 23:35.768
For your own good.

23:45.177 --> 23:47.337
You've eased father's anger, uncle?

23:47.472 --> 23:52.151
One day, you'll have the pleasure
of being brother to the king, Dastan.

23:52.390 --> 23:56.472
As long as you remember your most important duty,
you should do well.

23:56.686 --> 24:00.734
- Oh, and what's that?
- Making sure his wine glass stays full.

24:01.451 --> 24:07.331
I'm told that another of my sons
has joined the rank of great Persian Warrior.

24:15.096 --> 24:21.896
- We missed you, father.
- I was praying for you and your brothers, Dastan.

24:22.817 --> 24:29.981
Family, the bond between brothers
that is the sword, that defends our empire.

24:30.328 --> 24:34.408
And I pray that that sword
remains strong.

24:35.127 --> 24:39.327
I was hoping my actions
would spare our men unnecessary losses.

24:42.346 --> 24:45.191
A good man would've done
as you did, Dastan.

24:45.351 --> 24:50.870
Acting boldly and courageously
to bring the victory and spare lives.

24:51.818 --> 24:55.583
A great man would've stopped
the attack from happening at all,

24:55.783 --> 25:00.783
a great man would've stopped
what he knew to be wrong,

25:01.036 --> 25:04.366
no matter who was ordering.

25:04.546 --> 25:08.310
The boy I saw in that square,

25:08.510 --> 25:11.590
was capable of being
more than just good,

25:11.765 --> 25:15.725
but of being...great.

25:19.485 --> 25:24.365
Well in the meantime,
I have a gift for you.

25:27.413 --> 25:33.013
Some questiones the wisdom of my
bringing a boy from the streets into my family.

25:33.292 --> 25:37.017
I saw a boy whose blood
wasn't noble,

25:37.220 --> 25:42.380
but whose character was,
a King in spirit.

25:43.355 --> 25:45.834
Thank you, father.

25:45.983 --> 25:50.063
May I present,
the prayer robe of Alamut's regent.

25:59.963 --> 26:02.843
What can I grant you, in return?

26:11.229 --> 26:14.189
May I present the princess Tamina.

26:14.359 --> 26:17.439
Tus wishes to make a union
with her people through marriage.

26:17.609 --> 26:21.494
It is my deepest wish
that this win your approval.

26:24.749 --> 26:31.789
In all my travels, I have never looked
upon a more beautiful city, Your Highness.

26:32.929 --> 26:38.209
You should've seen it before your
horde of camel-ridding illiterates descended upon it.

26:40.107 --> 26:44.106
Clear as you will make a fine queen.

26:46.157 --> 26:50.642
But...Tus already has enough wives.

26:50.872 --> 26:54.472
You Dastan, might take fewer chances,

26:54.665 --> 26:57.987
if such a jewel
waited you in your chamber.

26:58.167 --> 27:03.454
The princess of Alamut
will be your first wife.

27:07.439 --> 27:10.724
Oh, what say you, Dastan?

27:10.902 --> 27:17.182
He plunges into a hundred foes without thought,
but before marriage, he stands frozen with fear,

27:17.491 --> 27:21.256
and that's for those who say
he's not yet wise.

27:21.454 --> 27:24.139
I need a drink.

27:30.807 --> 27:33.327
Stand aside.
Out of my way!

27:40.406 --> 27:43.885
- Father...
- Oh, God help us, the robe, it's poisoned!

27:44.077 --> 27:46.357
- Somebody help him!
- The robe Dastan gave him!

27:46.492 --> 27:49.434
- Why?!
- Somebody help him!

27:49.598 --> 27:52.506
- Seize the murderer!
- Somebody help him!

28:05.443 --> 28:07.563
- Bis! Bis!
- Come with me!

28:18.797 --> 28:21.996
- What do you think you're doing?
- I can get us out of here!

28:22.171 --> 28:25.336
- You're going to need my help.
- Come on!

28:39.869 --> 28:41.949
- Close the gate!
- That way!

28:46.880 --> 28:49.040
Close the gate!

28:50.219 --> 28:52.219
Get down!

28:55.101 --> 28:59.300
There, onto the murderer!
He's on my horse! He stole my horse!

29:09.080 --> 29:14.480
<i>My loyal subjects, the whole world
grieves at the death of our beloved King.</i>

29:14.750 --> 29:16.800
<i>We are all stricken
by his loss.</i>

29:16.926 --> 29:21.725
<i>But the murder came at prince
Dastan's hand, only makes our pain worse.</i>

29:21.969 --> 29:25.734
I didn't murder my father.
That robe was given to me by my brother.

29:25.933 --> 29:30.778
- Tus did this.
- And now he stands to be crowned king.

29:32.365 --> 29:35.565
I didn't kill my father.

29:37.038 --> 29:39.518
- I believe you.
- You shouldn't be here,

29:39.627 --> 29:44.546
- I shouldn't have let you come.
- But you did.

29:48.389 --> 29:53.029
I promised my brother I'll kill you,
if he couldn't have you.

29:53.418 --> 29:58.917
Well, the solution would be
to kiss me, and then kill me.

29:59.656 --> 30:02.176
But I have a better solution.

30:05.415 --> 30:08.535
I kill you,
and your problems are solved!

30:12.008 --> 30:14.887
Perhaps we could find
another solution.

30:51.818 --> 30:54.737
Well, the solution would be
to kiss me, and then kill me.

30:54.900 --> 30:57.465
But I have a better solution.

30:57.993 --> 31:00.193
I kill you!

31:06.548 --> 31:10.348
Give back what you stole, Persian!

31:12.682 --> 31:14.682
No!

31:29.375 --> 31:32.414
- Did you see that?
- See what?

31:33.881 --> 31:35.801
Go for that sword again,
and I swear I'll break your arm.

31:35.885 --> 31:37.884
Again?

31:38.805 --> 31:42.005
- You've used up all the sand!
- What?

31:42.644 --> 31:45.044
What is this?

31:47.652 --> 31:50.417
Incredible.

31:50.573 --> 31:55.292
Releasing the sand,
turns back time.

31:57.249 --> 32:00.849
And only the holder
of the Dagger is aware what's happened.

32:02.758 --> 32:06.198
He could go back and alter events,
change time.

32:06.383 --> 32:08.428
And no one knows, but him.

32:10.686 --> 32:14.206
How much can it unliken?
Answer me, princess.

32:14.395 --> 32:17.480
You destroyed my city.

32:18.615 --> 32:22.455
Our invasion wasn't about weapons
forges, it was about this Dagger.

32:23.873 --> 32:26.313
After the battle, Tus asked
for this Dagger as tribute,

32:26.455 --> 32:28.825
I didn't think anything of it,
but now I see.

32:28.964 --> 32:32.083
With it, he could change anything. He could
change the course of a critical moment in battle,

32:32.255 --> 32:35.065
He could foresee the blade of a rival.

32:35.223 --> 32:37.623
He wouldn't just be the king,
he'd be the most powerful ruler Persia ever seen,

32:37.763 --> 32:41.213
greater even than my father.
It was all about this dagger!

32:41.399 --> 32:44.964
<i>My treacherous brother
must be brought to justice.</i>

32:45.155 --> 32:48.400
<i>And as such, I have doubled
the reward for his capture.</i>

32:48.577 --> 32:53.856
<i>Meanwhile, I shall strive to protect
our Empire, as my father would've demanded.</i>

32:54.126 --> 32:57.571
<i>A new reign has begun.</i>

32:57.757 --> 33:00.637
- What are you doing?
- Garsiv can't be far behind us.

33:00.803 --> 33:04.443
She is the most famous horse in the Empire,
this would skew its tracks.

33:04.637 --> 33:08.206
- Tracks where, where are you going?
- To Avrat, where my father will be buried.

33:08.398 --> 33:11.197
You're wanted for the King's murder,
you're going to march into his funeral

33:11.319 --> 33:13.439
alongside thousands of
Persian soldiers.

33:13.567 --> 33:16.492
I hope Nizam will be there,
he's the only one I can trust.

33:16.660 --> 33:19.820
He'll see I was set up by Tus,
step aside, princess.

33:19.999 --> 33:22.079
Every road to Avrat
will be covered with Persian troops.

33:22.205 --> 33:24.655
Well I a'm not taking roads,
I'm going through the Valley of the Slaves.

33:24.798 --> 33:27.677
No one goes near that wasteland,
it's filled with murderers and cutthroats.

33:27.838 --> 33:30.683
- Yes, so they say.
- Your whole plan is suicide.

33:30.848 --> 33:32.928
My brother murdered my father,
and left his blood on my hands.

33:33.055 --> 33:35.220
If I die trying to set that right,
then so be it.

33:38.026 --> 33:41.591
So, you're going to leave me here,
in the middle of nowhere?!

33:41.782 --> 33:44.982
Noble Dastan, abandoning a helpless
woman in the wilderness.

33:45.157 --> 33:49.001
What does your precious
honor have to say about that?

33:51.254 --> 33:54.294
Oh, give me the strength not to kill her.

34:01.520 --> 34:04.400
Mounts up, we can't be far behind him.

34:10.032 --> 34:13.632
Without the right sand, it's just
another knife. Not even very sharp.

34:17.960 --> 34:21.880
- This sand, is there more of it?
- Of course not.

34:23.929 --> 34:26.226
- How can I get some?
- Try standing on your head

34:26.327 --> 34:28.547
and holding your breath.

34:35.070 --> 34:38.270
Did you see
what you're looking for, prince?

34:38.449 --> 34:41.449
Start walking.

34:48.255 --> 34:50.536
So, if you can't prove to your uncle
how the Dagger works,

34:50.636 --> 34:52.435
why on the world would
he believe you?

34:52.549 --> 34:55.234
It's not your problem, princess.

34:55.387 --> 34:57.912
You know, you really walk like one.

34:58.063 --> 35:01.863
Head held high, chest out,
long stomping strides.

35:03.154 --> 35:05.833
The walk of a self-satisfied
Persian prince.

35:05.991 --> 35:09.071
No doubt it comes from being told
since birth, the world is yours,

35:09.241 --> 35:12.971
- And you actually believing it.
- I wasn't born in a palace like you!

35:13.169 --> 35:17.569
I was born in the slums of Nasaf,
where I lived if I fought and I clawed for it.

35:18.385 --> 35:23.085
- And how did you become a prince?
- The king, marches the market one day,

35:23.289 --> 35:27.628
and he... I don't know, he...

35:27.852 --> 35:30.742
He found me.

35:30.904 --> 35:34.984
He took me in, he gave me
a family, he gave me a home.

35:41.462 --> 35:48.061
What you're looking at is,
the walk of a man, who just lost everything.

35:53.354 --> 35:57.354
Welcome to the Valley of Slaves,
Your Highness.

36:03.244 --> 36:06.244
- I'm desperate for a drop of water.
- Well, there's more than we have

36:06.410 --> 36:09.140
since you emptied our canteen hours ago.

36:09.295 --> 36:13.775
I wasn't born in this desert like
you Persians, all shriveled and angry.

36:14.010 --> 36:20.015
- My constitution is much more... delicate.
- I think you mean spoiled.

36:20.312 --> 36:24.116
The wells of Alamut are fame
for their clean, cold water.

36:24.317 --> 36:28.237
Perhaps less time admiring your wells,
and more time guarding your walls,

36:28.408 --> 36:30.407
and you wouldn't be here.

36:35.710 --> 36:39.710
Ah, a miracle, I've silenced a princess!

36:41.843 --> 36:45.163
Tamina?
Tamina?

36:48.103 --> 36:50.583
Can you hear me?

36:53.862 --> 36:56.942
Yes, Dastan,
I can hear you.

37:15.728 --> 37:18.368
Do you know
where you are Persian?

37:19.066 --> 37:21.471
And yet you're enter still?

37:21.611 --> 37:25.256
In the heart of Sudan there's
a tribe of warriors, known as the M'Baka.

37:25.451 --> 37:27.971
They strike fear into the hearts
of all they cross.

37:28.116 --> 37:31.326
The M'Baka, are masters
of the throwing knife.

37:31.502 --> 37:36.267
Wielding blades, said to have been blessed
by the Creator, Himself.

37:36.510 --> 37:41.909
Their aim is so murderously accurate,
they can decapitate three men,

37:42.179 --> 37:44.544
with one strike.

37:45.481 --> 37:48.481
No. I wouldn't even bother doing that,
if I were you. Do you know why?

37:49.362 --> 37:55.122
This is Seso, he is a M'Baka,
I have the good fortune of saving his life,

37:55.413 --> 37:59.372
which means, he is now
enduringly indebted to me.

37:59.961 --> 38:03.130
So tell me Persian,
is there any good reason why I shouldn't

38:03.268 --> 38:09.098
tell Seso, to put his next throw
so little higher?

38:46.531 --> 38:49.611
So, this is the one, eh?

38:50.287 --> 38:53.647
Yes, you're right,
she's not bad.

38:59.550 --> 39:03.430
She could smell better than that.
Still we have a deal.

39:03.640 --> 39:07.120
- Clever princess.
- Deal?

39:07.307 --> 39:09.392
What deal?

39:10.192 --> 39:13.557
- Such a noble prince.
- Such a gentle princess.

39:13.739 --> 39:18.238
I've taken you over with my fainting act,
eagerly leaping to assist the foreign beauty.

39:18.469 --> 39:20.934
- Who said you're a beauty?
- There's must be a reason

39:21.042 --> 39:22.041
why you can't take your
eyes off me.

39:23.164 --> 39:25.494
You're... I...

39:25.632 --> 39:28.117
I don't trust you,
and you're not my type.

39:28.261 --> 39:32.021
Oh, I'm not some desperate slave girl!
I'm actually capable of voicing my own folks!

39:32.225 --> 39:37.224
- Too many for my taste.
- Oh yeah, she'll make a very nice addition.

39:37.477 --> 39:39.687
What you intend to do with her?

39:39.819 --> 39:43.699
Yes, do tell him.
Can't you see how concerned he is?

39:44.618 --> 39:46.938
- Give me a moment.
- Yeah.

39:49.125 --> 39:52.884
It's hard for me to admit,
but you were right.

39:55.676 --> 40:00.076
- I did see what I was looking for.
- Dastan, listen to me.

40:00.559 --> 40:04.559
When my uncle sees the power
of this Dagger, he'll believe me.

40:04.774 --> 40:08.419
Dastan, I know. I haven't been
entirely honest with you.

40:08.613 --> 40:13.412
- But your lies are so clever.
- I'm the guardian of the divine covenant.

40:13.656 --> 40:17.101
That Dagger is sacred, it's been
smuggled to a safety when you stole it.

40:17.292 --> 40:20.032
- If the Dagger gets into the wrong hands...
- I will take care of your knife.

40:20.187 --> 40:24.857
- You don't want to miss this.
- You don't understand what's at stake!

40:25.096 --> 40:29.096
- This is the matter for the gods, not man!
- Your gods, not mine. Come on!

40:33.024 --> 40:35.224
Come on!

40:38.136 --> 40:40.946
Run quickly. Come on, ostrich!

40:46.879 --> 40:49.879
- Ostrich racing?
- Every Tuesday and Thursday.

40:50.468 --> 40:55.347
Whatever they like in beauty,
they make up for it. Fighting spirit.

40:56.727 --> 41:01.527
- And the races are easy to fix.
- I've heard all these terrible stories of this place.

41:01.771 --> 41:05.301
The bloodthirsty slaves,
murdering their masters?

41:05.490 --> 41:09.650
That's a good story, it's well told,
ever evolving, but alas untrue.

41:09.872 --> 41:13.671
- But the skeletons that we saw...
- Ah, I bought those from a gypsy in Bukhara.

41:13.872 --> 41:19.237
I crafted our lurid reputation,
in order to fend off the most insidious evil,

41:19.506 --> 41:21.831
that's been lurking this
forsaken country of ours.

41:21.973 --> 41:24.253
You know what I'm talkin' about?
Taxes.

41:26.021 --> 41:31.140
Dirty Persians, their armies, their fortresses,
their roads, who pays for it all, eh?

41:31.654 --> 41:33.734
The small businessmen.

41:33.866 --> 41:39.066
You see, that's why I started
a little campaign, to spread some false notoriety.

41:40.000 --> 41:44.320
I spread it like a venerable
disease in a Turkish harem.

42:03.494 --> 42:06.374
Behold the mighty ostrich!

42:12.757 --> 42:15.677
Come on, my beauty!

42:21.104 --> 42:23.584
I love this!

42:23.733 --> 42:30.012
And the tax collectors stay clear of me,
and my customers, everybody's happy.

42:30.784 --> 42:35.904
Hey! Get the girls on! Get the girls on,
come on. Crowd control!

42:37.587 --> 42:40.587
Don't you stand there!
Run, don't walk!

42:41.885 --> 42:44.645
Hey, you drop anything, you pay for it!
It's out of your wages.

42:44.806 --> 42:47.485
Don't look at me like that,
you know what I'm talkin' about!

42:47.638 --> 42:50.283
Do your job, crowd control.
Thank you!

42:50.439 --> 42:54.639
You know, I think our little arrange
is going to work out very well, young man.

42:56.782 --> 43:00.662
- Don't touch!
- Oh, ho, ho! She's a lively one! Where did you find her?

43:02.833 --> 43:05.717
In the slave market to Lurs
I was headed to Avrat.

43:05.879 --> 43:08.759
I trade her for a camel,
when she attacked me!

43:08.920 --> 43:11.765
- The camels are safer.
- Noble, Sheik Amar.

43:11.930 --> 43:15.070
I appreciate your hospitality,
you run a fine establishment.

43:15.242 --> 43:18.312
- But if you could give me the supply...
- You know something, Persian?

43:18.482 --> 43:25.161
You bear a remarkable resemblance to the disgrace prince,
who fled after murdering the king.

43:34.631 --> 43:37.671
Have I told you about
the M'Baka?

43:38.220 --> 43:42.065
- Yes, you have.
- Eh, nothing beats a good story. Eh, but yours however,

43:42.232 --> 43:46.665
trading her for a camel? Please.
I mean look at her. She's worth at least, two.

43:47.900 --> 43:49.180
And as for you, young man,

43:49.465 --> 43:52.545
did you know your brothers offered rewards
for you, it's quite frankly,

43:52.680 --> 43:57.699
between you and me, borders on the obscene.
I traded my own mother for that kind of gold.

43:57.952 --> 44:00.882
What? You didn't know
what she was like?

44:01.046 --> 44:04.045
Take him down to the Persian outpost.

44:04.176 --> 44:06.175
Wait, wait, wait. Look, that...

44:09.182 --> 44:11.582
- Nice knife.
- It's nothing.

44:13.689 --> 44:16.569
- That's worthless.
- Really?

44:17.529 --> 44:19.929
Melt it down for the jewels.

44:42.774 --> 44:45.294
What's the boy doing?!

44:46.321 --> 44:48.921
No, no, you might kill a bird!

44:51.121 --> 44:54.601
Hey, over here!

45:04.182 --> 45:07.142
- I wouldn't do that, if I were you!
- Get to the tunnel!

45:08.522 --> 45:11.722
Look at this! That's it.
No more fermented goat's milk

45:11.902 --> 45:15.102
after the third race,
do you hear me? Get off, come on!

45:15.277 --> 45:17.722
- The gate!
- Get him!

45:18.198 --> 45:19.843
Stop!

45:24.712 --> 45:27.597
- Lift the lever, it opens the gate!
- Give me the Dagger!

45:27.759 --> 45:31.039
- This isn't the time, lift that lever!
- Give me the Dagger!

45:35.145 --> 45:38.025
Don't think it didn't cross my mind.

45:42.447 --> 45:44.447
Move, princess!

45:45.577 --> 45:46.577
Dastan!

45:48.290 --> 45:51.090
Persian!

45:58.931 --> 46:01.930
Looking for this?

46:05.107 --> 46:08.067
Next time, you...!

46:16.666 --> 46:20.145
They all come for my father's funeral.

46:29.894 --> 46:32.694
There are a hundred Persian soldiers
watching that gate.

46:32.857 --> 46:35.337
Maybe more, if want you to stay closer
to this Dagger,

46:35.445 --> 46:37.444
you're going to have to help me
in the Avrat.

46:43.080 --> 46:47.080
All these foreign dignitaries,
I'm guessing you're known up here.

47:04.112 --> 47:06.797
Couldn't you have found
somebody lighter?

47:06.950 --> 47:10.630
The Mugals of the Hindu Kush
are noble people, you should be honored.

47:12.166 --> 47:14.846
Oh yes, terribly.

47:21.889 --> 47:24.969
- Dastan, where's the Dagger?
- You're welcome to search me for it.

47:25.138 --> 47:28.503
You'll have to be very thorough.

47:40.333 --> 47:43.933
Tus isn't here,
he must be in Alamut.

47:45.675 --> 47:49.675
The Sand that fills the Dagger, there's more
that hidden somewhere in Alamut, isn't there?

47:49.884 --> 47:53.729
That's why Tus stays there.
That's why he's got our army searching for.

47:54.188 --> 47:57.227
I have to get a message
to my uncle to meet me.

47:57.395 --> 48:00.040
That's impossible.

48:59.953 --> 49:02.913
- Difficult, not impossible.
- One more proof, you're insane.

49:03.083 --> 49:05.443
Why do you look so impressed?

49:05.586 --> 49:08.186
Out of the way!
Make way!

49:13.055 --> 49:15.695
- Turn around!
- What?

49:27.077 --> 49:29.877
You used to buy those for me,
when I was a boy.

49:30.035 --> 49:33.444
You used to spit the seeds
at Garsiv.

49:33.628 --> 49:35.968
You shouldn't have brought
me here, Dastan.

49:36.106 --> 49:38.411
I had no choice uncle, follow me.

50:01.462 --> 50:05.302
I didn't kill father, you know
I'd never do such a thing..

50:05.505 --> 50:08.150
Your actions speak otherwise.

50:08.974 --> 50:11.493
I had no choice but to flee.

50:11.638 --> 50:13.568
Tus gave me that cloak.

50:13.688 --> 50:16.488
- He was the one who poisoned it. - Dastan...
- But he's not here, is he?

50:16.902 --> 50:19.387
At his father's funeral,
instead he remains in Alamut.

50:19.531 --> 50:21.731
Our allies will see
our invasion is just,

50:21.863 --> 50:24.345
the search for Alamut's weapon
forges is important.

50:24.488 --> 50:28.900
Yes, but not if there were none.
The invasion of Alamut was a lie.

50:29.128 --> 50:31.648
Tus is after power,
that's why he murdered father,

50:31.758 --> 50:35.757
and now he searches not for weapons,
but for the Sand,

50:35.967 --> 50:38.577
that fuels the mystical device.

50:38.726 --> 50:41.006
This is why you brought me here, Dastan?
Mystical devices?

50:41.147 --> 50:45.507
Do you remember after the battle
you stopped Tus for taken the dagger I'd won?

50:45.737 --> 50:49.516
That dagger is the reason he invaded Alamut.

50:49.716 --> 50:53.461
This dagger, you have it with you?

50:56.253 --> 50:58.253
Yes.

51:03.556 --> 51:05.876
It has incredible powers.

51:09.313 --> 51:11.593
Is this some sort of a joke, Dastan?

51:13.153 --> 51:15.633
What? I know he was in there.

51:16.408 --> 51:19.288
And where is that so-called evidence?

51:19.449 --> 51:21.414
Tamina.

51:29.344 --> 51:31.624
- Your hands are burned.
- Yes...

51:34.018 --> 51:37.938
From trying to pull the poisoned cloak
of your father.

51:39.109 --> 51:41.308
- Is something wrong, Dastan?
- No, no.

51:41.404 --> 51:43.524
You're certain?
You know you can trust me, boy.

51:48.289 --> 51:50.894
It's just that a...

51:51.043 --> 51:55.323
Tus is my brother, how could
he betray me like this?

51:55.545 --> 52:00.190
I can't say Dastan, perhaps he never
respected you as you deserve,

52:00.433 --> 52:02.433
and he saw you as someone he could use.

52:02.556 --> 52:04.486
Someone to keep his wine glass filled.

52:04.606 --> 52:07.050
My service to your father was different.

52:07.192 --> 52:10.712
- We shared the same blood, Dastan.
- How many times did father speak

52:10.866 --> 52:13.865
of you saving him from that lion?

52:14.031 --> 52:16.956
- That was his favorite story.
- One of many, yes.

52:17.124 --> 52:21.324
- No, that was his favorite.
- I'm afraid you're speaking in riddles, Dastan.

52:25.428 --> 52:28.148
Wait, Dastan!

52:58.499 --> 53:00.519
Over here!

53:20.428 --> 53:22.427
Murderer!

53:30.443 --> 53:32.843
I didn't kill father!

54:42.008 --> 54:44.288
What you're going to do now?!

55:32.376 --> 55:35.016
Where is he?!

55:35.610 --> 55:37.149
Hey!

55:56.996 --> 55:58.996
Garsiv...

55:59.917 --> 56:03.637
- I didn't kill father.
- Then God will pardon you.

56:03.834 --> 56:05.919
After your head rolls.

56:15.483 --> 56:18.402
We don't fight with the
sticks anymore, little brother.

56:29.045 --> 56:31.245
That's all you got?

56:48.991 --> 56:52.191
Your Majesty,
I thought you were staying in Alamut.

56:52.366 --> 56:55.290
Tell me about Dastan, uncle.

56:56.251 --> 57:00.371
Dastan came to Avrat to kill me,
in the market place.

57:00.586 --> 57:02.551
I just got away.

57:02.637 --> 57:06.916
Tus, my death would weaken
your young reign.

57:07.143 --> 57:10.123
- Dastan hopes to start rebellion.
- He wants the throne?

57:10.253 --> 57:11.752
I fear so, my Lord.

57:16.115 --> 57:19.875
Putting Dastan on trial would give him
a stage for his sedition.

57:20.079 --> 57:24.759
My advice would be to avoid a trial.

57:24.998 --> 57:28.363
Don't bring him back to Nasaf alive.

57:37.397 --> 57:39.162
Whatever Dastan's crimes,

57:39.275 --> 57:43.075
a public trial will best
communicate the king I hope to be.

57:43.276 --> 57:46.601
Strong, honoring the rule of law.

57:47.579 --> 57:51.899
- We are not savages.
- You grow more a king every day.

57:52.503 --> 57:56.823
Dastan must be found.
He must be brought to justice.

58:02.184 --> 58:05.504
HASSASINS LAIR

58:06.357 --> 58:09.717
- I need to speak with our guests.
- About them, my Lord,

58:09.899 --> 58:13.400
their practices are unusual,
the servants have seen things.

58:13.589 --> 58:17.057
Heard strange sounds, last
week one of the horses vanished.

58:17.248 --> 58:22.648
Just make sure that the servants keep
their mouths shut, or I promise you,

58:22.919 --> 58:25.444
they will vanish as well.

59:28.564 --> 59:30.769
I have another task
for you Hassansin,

59:30.901 --> 59:33.061
but you'll have to be quick,
your prey has a head start.

59:33.196 --> 59:36.756
You brought what I requested?

59:45.590 --> 59:48.689
These practices,
they don't interfere with your skills?

59:48.860 --> 59:51.925
In trance we can see visions
of far future.

59:52.094 --> 59:54.459
Visions of death.

59:55.813 --> 01:00:00.093
Destiny and the curse.

01:00:06.955 --> 01:00:11.275
In the trance we can find anything,
including your nephew, prince Dastan.

01:00:11.498 --> 01:00:14.663
Then I hope you shall see more deaths.

01:00:15.301 --> 01:00:17.301
Soon.

01:00:54.109 --> 01:00:56.829
Get down, it's a Persian patrol.

01:01:08.965 --> 01:01:11.845
What aren't you telling me?

01:01:12.887 --> 01:01:17.927
The trail's been left, maybe they are tired
of your pawn shop for lies and backstabbing.

01:01:18.182 --> 01:01:20.844
I had no choice but to leave you.

01:01:20.996 --> 01:01:23.624
I take it your uncle didn't listen.

01:01:23.779 --> 01:01:27.738
It wasn't Tus that killed my father,
it was Nizam.

01:01:27.951 --> 01:01:31.111
- Your uncle?
- His hands were burned.

01:01:31.290 --> 01:01:33.650
He said it happened trying
to pull off the cloak that killed my father,

01:01:33.794 --> 01:01:37.674
I've gone over and over at my mind, he never
touched the cloak, he must've handled it before.

01:01:40.763 --> 01:01:43.727
It was Nizam who poisoned it.

01:01:43.892 --> 01:01:48.172
What could this turning back a few moments
of time give my uncle? None.

01:01:48.399 --> 01:01:51.644
He murdered my father for more
than just a dagger.

01:01:51.821 --> 01:01:56.741
What aren't you telling me? You know,
you've got quick hands, so do I.

01:01:57.455 --> 01:02:00.255
If you want it back,
you tell me everything.

01:02:00.412 --> 01:02:03.656
No more games,
no more lies.

01:02:13.103 --> 01:02:15.303
Can we get out of here?

01:02:21.449 --> 01:02:26.128
Oh...only a princess thinks
she can outrun a sandstorm.

01:02:31.047 --> 01:02:34.047
Nizam is coming to kill us,
he needs me dead.

01:02:35.345 --> 01:02:37.905
I need to know why.

01:02:41.771 --> 01:02:46.691
In Alamut rests the beating heart
of all life on earth.

01:02:46.940 --> 01:02:50.105
The Sand Glass of the gods.

01:02:50.868 --> 01:02:55.908
Long ago, the gods slipped down on man
and saw nothing but greed and treachery.

01:02:56.163 --> 01:03:01.167
So they sent a great sandstorm,
to destroy all, wipe clean the face of the earth.

01:03:01.425 --> 01:03:05.705
<i>But one young girl begged the gods
to give mankind another chance.</i>

01:03:05.927 --> 01:03:08.577
<i>Offering her life in exchange.</i>

01:03:08.728 --> 01:03:14.608
Seeing the purity within, the gods were
reminded of men's potentials for good.

01:03:14.899 --> 01:03:18.864
So they swept the sand into the Sand Glass.

01:03:34.350 --> 01:03:37.950
The Dagger was given to the girl
who saved Man.

01:03:38.148 --> 01:03:40.392
<i>Making her the first guardian.</i>

01:03:40.526 --> 01:03:43.926
<i>The Dagger blade is the only thing
that can pierce the Sand Glass</i>

01:03:44.109 --> 01:03:48.559
and remove the Sands of Time,
but the handle only holds one minute.

01:03:48.788 --> 01:03:51.448
But if one were to place a Dagger
in the Sand Glass, and pressed the

01:03:51.565 --> 01:03:53.064
jewel button at the same time?

01:03:53.170 --> 01:03:56.250
- Sand would flow through endlessly.
- You could turn back time as far as you like.

01:03:56.420 --> 01:03:59.184
Yes, but it is forbidden.

01:04:05.647 --> 01:04:10.367
When my father was a boy,
Nizam saved his life hunting.

01:04:12.032 --> 01:04:15.032
<i>One day the two princes
were stalking a beautiful buck,</i>

01:04:15.198 --> 01:04:18.127
<i>but they weren't aware of a lion
stalking them.</i>

01:04:18.291 --> 01:04:24.091
<i>Nizam saved Sharaman.
My father told us the story over and over again.</i>

01:04:24.378 --> 01:04:26.823
I don't understand.

01:04:26.971 --> 01:04:30.771
Nizam wishes to go back in time
and undo what he did.

01:04:30.972 --> 01:04:33.417
Not save my father,
let him die.

01:04:33.559 --> 01:04:36.648
Then he will be king for a lifetime.

01:04:36.818 --> 01:04:39.978
And my brothers would never be born.

01:04:46.375 --> 01:04:48.655
The storm's passed.

01:05:16.587 --> 01:05:21.627
Dastan, the Sands contained within
the Sand Glass are incredibly powerful.

01:05:24.933 --> 01:05:29.453
Opening the Dagger while it's
inside the glass breaks the seal

01:05:29.685 --> 01:05:33.415
and destroys the Sand Glass,
causing it to crack and shatter.

01:05:33.613 --> 01:05:36.577
The Sands of Time would no
longer be contained,

01:05:36.742 --> 01:05:39.562
and they would carry
the gods' wrath with them once more,

01:05:39.685 --> 01:05:42.584
destroying everything in their path.

01:05:45.714 --> 01:05:49.394
And all of mankind would pay
for Nizam's treachery.

01:05:50.805 --> 01:05:54.289
This is all that would be left of us.

01:05:54.477 --> 01:05:58.077
The secret guardian temple outside
Alamut is the sanctuary.

01:05:58.269 --> 01:06:00.839
The one place where the Dagger
can be hidden safely,

01:06:00.987 --> 01:06:03.627
the only way to stop this Armageddon.

01:06:04.910 --> 01:06:08.110
That's the truth, Dastan.

01:06:08.874 --> 01:06:14.473
Give me back the Dagger, so that
I can take it there.

01:06:16.510 --> 01:06:19.190
I can't do that.

01:06:22.102 --> 01:06:26.742
- I'm coming with you.
- You're going to help me!

01:06:28.362 --> 01:06:31.802
We can sit here and chat,
or you can get on the horse.

01:06:47.474 --> 01:06:49.639
Our journey is blessed.

01:06:49.769 --> 01:06:53.488
We'll stop for the water and push
for the mountain's pass by the nightfall.

01:06:54.776 --> 01:06:59.056
- You enjoy telling me what to do.
- Only because you are so good at following orders.

01:06:59.283 --> 01:07:01.643
Don't press your luck.

01:07:15.098 --> 01:07:17.098
Persian!

01:07:17.226 --> 01:07:22.386
We parted under certain rush circumstances,
I didn't get a chance to say goodbye.

01:07:23.695 --> 01:07:26.060
We've been tracking you for a week.

01:07:26.199 --> 01:07:29.879
That little riot you started,
it went on for two days!

01:07:31.206 --> 01:07:36.286
My beloved racetrack,
all washed away like the footprints in sand.

01:07:36.542 --> 01:07:38.672
See Lita there...
Look at her?

01:07:38.801 --> 01:07:40.881
She's all that's left
of my gaming empire.

01:07:41.012 --> 01:07:44.172
And no matter
your skills as a promoter,

01:07:44.351 --> 01:07:49.350
you can't organize an ostrich race
with just one ostrich!

01:07:49.603 --> 01:07:51.933
Am I right?!

01:07:52.070 --> 01:07:55.150
Yes sir, come with me.

01:08:01.251 --> 01:08:04.851
Did you know that the ostriches
have suicidal tendencies?

01:08:05.925 --> 01:08:08.405
Look at this poor thing.

01:08:08.554 --> 01:08:12.453
She used to be a grand champion,
and now I have to watch her

01:08:12.659 --> 01:08:16.524
night and day to make sure
she doesn't do anything stupid.

01:08:22.116 --> 01:08:25.756
Suddenly occurred to me, that the only way
to recoup my tragic losses,

01:08:25.950 --> 01:08:29.519
was to track down the two young lovers
who cast this dark cloud upon me.

01:08:29.710 --> 01:08:34.910
Oh yes, I'm gonna need the prize on your head,
your brother will be very pleased to see...

01:08:38.682 --> 01:08:41.162
The sand dervishes Persian,
they are common as camel dirt...

01:08:41.270 --> 01:08:42.870
Sheik Amar, listen to me...!

01:08:43.564 --> 01:08:46.450
- I'd rather not.
- Nice knife.

01:08:46.611 --> 01:08:49.575
Noble Sheik, we are on the
sacred journey to the temple...

01:08:49.740 --> 01:08:53.740
Temple, the temple, there is nothing
more sacred than Persian's gold.

01:09:41.903 --> 01:09:44.223
Give me the Dagger,
there are too many of them.

01:09:46.408 --> 01:09:49.089
You can't kill them all,
you wanna live, give me the Dagger!!

01:10:08.818 --> 01:10:11.218
Give me the Dagger!

01:10:24.674 --> 01:10:27.754
Persian, how did you do that?

01:10:30.392 --> 01:10:32.632
Instinct.

01:10:34.273 --> 01:10:36.473
What?

01:10:45.247 --> 01:10:48.047
We have to get out of here.

01:10:50.255 --> 01:10:54.015
- What happened last night?
- Those vipers were controlled by Hassansins.

01:10:54.219 --> 01:10:56.384
- Hassansins?
- For years they were the covert

01:10:56.515 --> 01:10:59.315
killing force for the Persian kings,
for my father ordered them disbanded.

01:10:59.472 --> 01:11:03.596
Nizam must've disobeyed my father's orders
and kept them intact.

01:11:03.817 --> 01:11:07.197
This is a secret government killing society.
That's why I don't pay taxes!

01:11:07.380 --> 01:11:10.725
- We can't stop.
- Oh perhaps you can't, but we can.

01:11:10.911 --> 01:11:13.911
We could use your help
getting to the temple.

01:11:14.077 --> 01:11:16.407
Hah, by crossing the Hindu Kush
with the storm blowing?

01:11:16.545 --> 01:11:19.745
You attract troubles like flies around
rotting mango and your insane...

01:11:19.884 --> 01:11:21.882
There's gold at the temple.

01:11:22.005 --> 01:11:24.650
More than ten horses can carry.

01:11:24.801 --> 01:11:27.966
- Tax-free.
- Sir!

01:11:57.523 --> 01:12:02.322
- Do you have any idea where you're going?
- I memorized this path as a child.

01:12:02.566 --> 01:12:06.531
Every princess must, it's sacred.

01:12:09.290 --> 01:12:12.210
It's here.

01:12:19.555 --> 01:12:23.955
The sanctuary, the one place the Dagger
can be hidden safely.

01:12:24.182 --> 01:12:27.747
I was expecting golden statues, waterfalls.

01:12:31.741 --> 01:12:36.061
Give me back the Dagger, so that
I can take it there.

01:12:53.566 --> 01:12:56.646
Don't cut yourself, princess.

01:13:01.702 --> 01:13:03.702
Hey, here!

01:13:06.460 --> 01:13:10.300
Not long dead, last night maybe.
Tortured first.

01:13:10.502 --> 01:13:14.067
- Hassansin.
- Nizam knows this place.

01:13:14.258 --> 01:13:16.982
All dead.

01:13:19.395 --> 01:13:21.515
- The entire village, about my gold...
- Where are you going?!

01:13:22.150 --> 01:13:24.115
- There is only one way to stop all of this.
- What?!

01:13:24.236 --> 01:13:27.836
To make sure the Dagger is safe,
the temple holds the stone the Dagger came from.

01:13:28.029 --> 01:13:30.239
What temple? This is
a pile of stones and rocks!

01:13:30.371 --> 01:13:33.271
The first thing we learned, if all else fails,
put the Dagger back into the stone,

01:13:33.397 --> 01:13:38.295
the stone will envelop it, pulling it
into the mountain, returning to the gods.

01:13:46.019 --> 01:13:53.384
- The original promise, must be paid.
- What promise?

01:13:53.739 --> 01:13:57.458
The gods must take back
the life they spared.

01:13:58.245 --> 01:14:00.445
You'll die.

01:14:10.222 --> 01:14:13.022
- Stay there! Stay there!
- Listen to me! Listen to me!

01:14:14.396 --> 01:14:17.760
Give me your sword, give me your sword
or do you fortake given that honor.

01:14:17.942 --> 01:14:20.862
There are bodies down there,
murdered by Hassansins, on Nizam's order!

01:14:21.025 --> 01:14:23.750
- He's the traitor!
- Hassansins no longer exist!

01:14:23.909 --> 01:14:26.389
- You always thought you are so clever.
- This is no trick, Garsiv.

01:14:26.533 --> 01:14:30.898
Sir, all dead inside Sir,
more in the village.

01:14:31.124 --> 01:14:33.809
- There is only one way...
- Stay there!

01:14:38.181 --> 01:14:40.821
Nizam wants me dead,
wants me silenced.

01:14:40.971 --> 01:14:43.576
A trial will be too public.

01:14:47.862 --> 01:14:50.347
Do you know this?
He said this much, didn't he?

01:14:50.491 --> 01:14:53.970
I know it hasn't been easy
between us Garsiv, but still...

01:14:54.455 --> 01:14:55.735
we are brothers.

01:14:55.791 --> 01:14:57.790
Touching words
with my sword at your throat.

01:14:57.919 --> 01:15:00.964
You've often questioned why
father has been so much time in prayer.

01:15:01.132 --> 01:15:02.123
Before he died,
he told me that the bond

01:15:02.167 --> 01:15:05.175
between brothers
is the sword that defends our empire.

01:15:05.342 --> 01:15:07.787
He was praying that
that sword remains strong.

01:15:07.934 --> 01:15:11.894
Why would I go into Avrat for father's
funeral, when I knew it was so dangerous?

01:15:20.202 --> 01:15:22.202
Nizam recommended your death,

01:15:22.331 --> 01:15:24.976
Tus disagreed, ordered
you brought back alive.

01:15:25.127 --> 01:15:30.127
Nizam wants me dead, and he's hired
Hassansins to make sure that does happen.

01:15:30.380 --> 01:15:33.744
He's afraid of what I might say,

01:15:33.926 --> 01:15:36.971
and who I might tell.

01:15:40.483 --> 01:15:43.243
Tell me, brother.

01:15:45.783 --> 01:15:47.783
Garsiv?

01:15:52.041 --> 01:15:54.041
My Garsiv?

01:15:58.092 --> 01:16:00.492
Hassansins!

01:16:18.832 --> 01:16:20.832
Shut up!

01:16:32.936 --> 01:16:35.016
Protect the Dagger!

01:16:51.506 --> 01:16:53.626
Persian, behind you!

01:17:04.025 --> 01:17:06.705
Tamina!

01:17:06.863 --> 01:17:09.862
Forget them, throw these!

01:17:10.028 --> 01:17:12.753
Find her!

01:17:20.425 --> 01:17:22.670
Hey! Over here!

01:17:22.803 --> 01:17:25.603
You know what they say about men
with big swords!

01:17:39.704 --> 01:17:42.304
Tamina, let me do it.

01:17:43.376 --> 01:17:46.476
Only a guardian can return the Dagger.

01:17:46.647 --> 01:17:49.711
This isn't something you can do, Dastan.

01:17:50.970 --> 01:17:54.570
I'm ready for this.

01:17:54.763 --> 01:17:57.848
I'm not.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
Tamina!

01:19:04.205 --> 01:19:07.005
Out, enough, out!

01:19:25.612 --> 01:19:27.612
Garsiv!

01:19:27.991 --> 01:19:30.471
Dastan, I'm sorry.

01:19:33.625 --> 01:19:36.825
Save the empire.

01:19:38.716 --> 01:19:41.916
Brother... Brother.

01:19:46.143 --> 01:19:50.223
- Where is the Dagger?
- It's gone.

01:19:51.652 --> 01:19:56.452
Protect the Dagger, no matter the
consequences, that was my sacred calling.

01:19:57.119 --> 01:19:59.999
That was my destiny.

01:20:05.339 --> 01:20:08.739
We make our own destiny, princess.

01:20:08.923 --> 01:20:11.488
We'll get it back.

01:20:43.313 --> 01:20:46.033
We're going to need another horse!

01:20:48.237 --> 01:20:51.517
- Where will you go?
- To Alamut.

01:20:54.789 --> 01:20:59.189
Nizam will use that Dagger to pierce
the Sand Glass, and he has to be stopped.

01:20:59.415 --> 01:21:02.700
He has to be stopped.
He has to be stopped.

01:21:05.763 --> 01:21:07.763
What?

01:21:08.851 --> 01:21:11.891
Oh, a knife thrower with a conscience.

01:21:31.803 --> 01:21:33.803
Our friends in the palace said
that the Persians have broken through

01:21:33.890 --> 01:21:35.889
to the first level of the tunnels.

01:21:36.017 --> 01:21:38.661
They will reach the Sand Glass
within hours.

01:21:38.812 --> 01:21:42.972
Nizam's keeping the Dagger in the high
temple, guarded by some sort of demon,

01:21:43.189 --> 01:21:47.314
- covered in spikes.
- The Hassansin that killed my brother.

01:21:47.529 --> 01:21:50.939
It's the only thing that stands between
us and the Dagger.

01:21:51.123 --> 01:21:54.123
No man can stand within
twenty yards of him and live.

01:21:54.290 --> 01:21:58.054
Some don't need to get that close.

01:22:17.704 --> 01:22:20.024
Spare some water, sire.

01:22:28.471 --> 01:22:30.571
You sure about this?

01:22:30.698 --> 01:22:32.728
I owed the boy.

01:22:32.853 --> 01:22:35.817
But, you are a M'Baka, scourge of
the Namibian plain.

01:22:35.982 --> 01:22:38.702
Me, I'm a slightly dishonorable
entrepreneur, this...

01:22:38.820 --> 01:22:41.819
nobility business
is not the cloth we're cut from.

01:22:41.986 --> 01:22:43.916
Hurry.

01:22:44.036 --> 01:22:49.516
My friend, has anyone ever told you
that you talk too much?

01:22:56.346 --> 01:22:58.346
Come on.

01:25:45.642 --> 01:25:48.641
Have I told you about the M'Baka?

01:25:49.815 --> 01:25:53.735
- Yes, you have.
- I hope your brother listens to you, Persian.

01:26:02.543 --> 01:26:04.508
He's here.

01:26:04.629 --> 01:26:08.428
Seal every gate!
Find him!

01:26:41.685 --> 01:26:43.765
- It's clear.
- Dastan, I don't...

01:26:45.316 --> 01:26:47.835
I don't think you should do this.

01:26:47.980 --> 01:26:50.442
Is that concern I hear?

01:26:50.585 --> 01:26:53.013
- Caution.
- Sprinkled with concern.

01:26:53.160 --> 01:26:58.640
- You flatter yourself, prince.
- And you used to be a better liar, princess.

01:26:58.914 --> 01:27:02.044
Perhaps I'm out of practice.

01:27:02.216 --> 01:27:05.895
This won't be the last time
we'll be together.

01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:19.760
- Where is the Dagger?
- You Persian bureaucrats, such soft hands.

01:27:28.839 --> 01:27:33.119
- It's been found, my Lord.
- The Sand Glass?

01:27:34.848 --> 01:27:37.248
I don't have the Dagger.

01:27:38.604 --> 01:27:40.604
Leave me.

01:27:41.441 --> 01:27:43.521
Hello, Tus.

01:27:43.653 --> 01:27:45.852
Dastan!

01:27:46.657 --> 01:27:48.997
- We need to talk.
- Then talk!

01:27:49.135 --> 01:27:53.440
- Alone.
- Wait outside the chamber, now!

01:27:55.713 --> 01:27:58.113
We are brothers, did you know?

01:27:59.385 --> 01:28:01.385
The robe that killed father
was poisoned by Nizam.

01:28:01.508 --> 01:28:04.992
- Nizam? You are mad.
- Who gave you the robe, Tus?

01:28:05.180 --> 01:28:07.510
Who gave you the robe?!

01:28:07.647 --> 01:28:11.727
You trust him, as did I, but Alamut
wasn't supplying our enemies with weapons.

01:28:11.940 --> 01:28:14.185
- Nizam lied to us.
- Why he would do such a thing,

01:28:14.324 --> 01:28:17.969
- what could he gain?
- Listen to me carefully.

01:28:18.163 --> 01:28:20.643
Beneath the streets of this city
lies an ancient force,

01:28:20.792 --> 01:28:24.236
a container, holding
the fabled Sands of Time.

01:28:24.422 --> 01:28:26.502
Nizam wishes to use it
to corrupt history,

01:28:26.634 --> 01:28:29.634
he wants to turn back time
and make himself king.

01:28:29.800 --> 01:28:32.130
Sands of Time?

01:28:32.268 --> 01:28:34.433
Heresies Dastan, pagan madness.

01:28:34.563 --> 01:28:37.323
I've seen its power with my own eyes, Tus.

01:28:37.484 --> 01:28:41.764
Nizam discovered its resting place, and if
we don't stop him our world could end.

01:28:41.985 --> 01:28:45.950
If you're gonna kill me, the best
you do it now.

01:28:51.463 --> 01:28:53.908
This is no ordinary dagger.

01:28:54.050 --> 01:28:58.530
You press the jewel on its hilt,
and you'll see.

01:29:00.727 --> 01:29:03.526
I should have the strength
to do this before we invaded the city.

01:29:03.684 --> 01:29:08.249
- What are you talking about?
- To act of what I know is right.

01:29:08.483 --> 01:29:10.528
No matter the consequences.

01:29:21.508 --> 01:29:24.588
- The soldiers remain out...
- Stay where you are!

01:29:31.189 --> 01:29:33.154
He took his own life.

01:29:33.276 --> 01:29:36.996
Then, God have mercy on the traitor,
for he chose the path of the coward.

01:29:38.075 --> 01:29:40.354
We both know Dastan was many things,

01:29:40.495 --> 01:29:43.775
but not... a coward.

01:29:45.794 --> 01:29:51.394
<i>This is no ordinary dagger. Press
the jewel on its hilt, and you'll see.</i>

01:30:12.168 --> 01:30:14.608
No matter the consequences.

01:30:14.750 --> 01:30:17.160
Stop!

01:30:17.301 --> 01:30:20.900
A moment ago you died
before my eyes.

01:30:21.765 --> 01:30:24.885
- Oh, you pressed it.
- How did you know I would?

01:30:26.689 --> 01:30:29.569
Cause we are brothers.

01:30:33.283 --> 01:30:34.363
The day we left for war,

01:30:34.431 --> 01:30:39.010
our father told me a true king
considers the advice of the counsel.

01:30:39.244 --> 01:30:42.974
But always listens to his heart.

01:30:43.172 --> 01:30:46.372
You shouldn't defy to go so far
for me to believe you.

01:30:46.547 --> 01:30:49.712
Your Majesty,
the soldiers tell me that...

01:30:51.519 --> 01:30:54.439
I see that Dastan
has indeed return.

01:30:57.026 --> 01:30:59.146
Tus, remember what I told you!

01:31:04.580 --> 01:31:06.660
No, a moment.

01:31:07.668 --> 01:31:11.388
Poor Tus, so eager for the crown.

01:31:12.801 --> 01:31:16.680
And you, Dastan,
always charging in,

01:31:16.889 --> 01:31:20.529
so desperate to prove
you are more than

01:31:20.723 --> 01:31:24.328
something that king
scraped of the street.

01:31:25.444 --> 01:31:28.404
What a glorious mess we are.

01:31:29.284 --> 01:31:31.849
It seems that bond between brothers,

01:31:31.996 --> 01:31:35.475
is no longer the sword
that defends our empire.

01:31:36.168 --> 01:31:37.648
Yes!

01:32:00.163 --> 01:32:02.763
He was one of us.

01:32:04.670 --> 01:32:07.315
He was the priest of the temple.

01:32:07.466 --> 01:32:10.786
That's how Nizam discovered
the existence of the Sand Glass.

01:32:10.966 --> 01:32:13.811
He corrupted the guardians,
infected us.

01:32:13.970 --> 01:32:16.935
We are no longer pure.

01:32:17.689 --> 01:32:20.009
We must hurry.

01:32:27.288 --> 01:32:29.253
Pulley.

01:32:29.374 --> 01:32:31.854
Get pulley, now!

01:32:35.007 --> 01:32:39.007
The guardians built passageways underneath
the city, a secret access to the Sand Glass.

01:32:39.217 --> 01:32:41.782
If we move fast enough,
we can get there before Nizam.

01:33:08.182 --> 01:33:11.302
That would be the stand
to the Sand Glass chamber.

01:33:11.474 --> 01:33:14.398
There is only one safe path.

01:33:14.775 --> 01:33:17.855
Faster!

01:33:35.306 --> 01:33:38.026
Follow in my footsteps.

01:33:40.105 --> 01:33:43.825
Nothing can touch the surface,
other than where I step.

01:34:05.352 --> 01:34:07.352
Run, Dastan!
Run!

01:34:17.369 --> 01:34:19.529
Dastan!

01:37:04.453 --> 01:37:06.453
Nizam!

01:37:08.627 --> 01:37:12.347
You murdered your own family.
Sharaman was your brother!

01:37:12.544 --> 01:37:14.789
And my curse.

01:37:16.973 --> 01:37:19.693
I looked up to you.

01:37:21.396 --> 01:37:22.475
Dastan!

01:37:22.543 --> 01:37:26.923
I never understood, why
my brother brought trash into the palace.

01:37:27.149 --> 01:37:29.599
Enjoy the gutter, Dastan.

01:37:29.742 --> 01:37:32.702
It's where you stay under my reign.

01:37:42.761 --> 01:37:44.841
Tamina!

01:37:45.348 --> 01:37:48.548
Nizam, don't use the Dagger
to undo your past!

01:37:48.729 --> 01:37:51.369
- It will unleash...
- Unleash, what?!

01:37:51.519 --> 01:37:54.124
Gods' wrath?!
Hell itself?!

01:37:58.619 --> 01:38:01.418
Don't do this!

01:38:15.394 --> 01:38:18.514
Stop him! If the glass
shatters, the world dies with it.

01:38:20.109 --> 01:38:24.709
It's not my destiny, it's yours.
It always has been.

01:38:24.944 --> 01:38:27.474
- Let me go.
- I won't.

01:38:27.620 --> 01:38:30.700
- Let me go.
- I'm not letting you go!

01:38:30.875 --> 01:38:34.835
I wish we could have been together.

01:38:41.516 --> 01:38:45.116
- Dastan!
- No! Tamina!

01:39:16.569 --> 01:39:21.068
- Dastan!
- Tamina!

01:40:35.729 --> 01:40:37.729
Prince, Dastan!

01:40:39.360 --> 01:40:42.960
- Bis, you're here?
- Of course I'm here.

01:40:43.533 --> 01:40:47.053
Our men surrounded Alamut's palace,
battle is over.

01:40:47.242 --> 01:40:49.527
Not yet.

01:40:57.303 --> 01:41:00.023
Wait!

01:41:03.396 --> 01:41:05.396
Wait!

01:41:12.577 --> 01:41:17.776
Brave soldiers of Persia, we have been
deceived into attacking this holy city!

01:41:18.038 --> 01:41:22.163
- Alamut, has no weapon forges!
- Dastan!

01:41:23.593 --> 01:41:27.193
- Have you gone mad?
- I cannot stand silent in the face of treachery.

01:41:27.391 --> 01:41:31.291
This war was set up by one
trusted above all us.

01:41:31.496 --> 01:41:35.360
- Our uncle Nizam.
- Dastan has fought hard today,

01:41:35.564 --> 01:41:38.686
perhaps too hard. What he needs now
is to get out from under this

01:41:38.858 --> 01:41:41.862
burning sun, to rest.
Gather his wits.

01:41:42.028 --> 01:41:44.712
The weapons we've found
are forgeries!

01:41:44.865 --> 01:41:47.480
There are no weapons here uncle,
and you know it!

01:41:47.630 --> 01:41:50.990
And the spy, who supposedly
intercepted them, was hired by you,

01:41:51.177 --> 01:41:54.456
to persuade all of us,
to invade Alamut!

01:41:54.634 --> 01:41:57.164
What is this, Dastan?
Victor's remorse?

01:41:57.310 --> 01:42:00.430
You yourself led the attack,
brought us this great triumph.

01:42:02.235 --> 01:42:05.515
I should never have
let the attack happen.

01:42:07.242 --> 01:42:10.202
I knew in my heart that it was wrong.

01:42:12.666 --> 01:42:15.111
It will never be you.

01:42:15.254 --> 01:42:19.294
You'll never been king,
you don't have the heart.

01:42:19.505 --> 01:42:23.510
You will die
in a shadow of a great man.

01:42:28.399 --> 01:42:31.318
Get him down from there, before
he makes even bigger fool of himself!

01:42:31.518 --> 01:42:35.413
Tus, before we left Nasaf,
father told you this:

01:42:35.618 --> 01:42:37.198
"That the true king, considers
the advice of the counsel,

01:42:37.267 --> 01:42:41.166
but he always
listens to his own heart."

01:42:41.627 --> 01:42:44.112
Father and I were alone.
How could you know that?

01:42:44.256 --> 01:42:47.856
He's right, he knows us and
he knows we are capable of.

01:42:48.049 --> 01:42:51.013
- Just listen to your heart.
- He defies your order,

01:42:51.177 --> 01:42:55.142
leads attack and now wants
to turn back, Tus...

01:42:55.815 --> 01:42:59.015
Take action here.

01:43:10.670 --> 01:43:13.435
The spy knows the truth,
find the spy!

01:43:13.592 --> 01:43:16.952
Bring him to me,
we'll wring it from him.

01:43:54.236 --> 01:43:56.476
You had what every man
could ever dream,

01:43:56.610 --> 01:44:00.335
love, respect and family.

01:44:01.330 --> 01:44:04.250
But that wasn't enough for you, was it?

01:44:40.389 --> 01:44:43.069
Princess of Alamut.

01:44:43.728 --> 01:44:46.607
I was misled to attack your city.

01:44:47.482 --> 01:44:49.927
Forgive me, Your Highness.

01:44:50.070 --> 01:44:53.470
Let me try to make amends?

01:45:00.711 --> 01:45:03.071
It would be to our mutual advantage,

01:45:03.210 --> 01:45:07.494
that our nations be united
by a bond stronger than friendship.

01:45:08.097 --> 01:45:10.617
Marriage.

01:45:11.143 --> 01:45:16.623
Your marriage to one who is both
conqueror and savior of your city.

01:45:21.367 --> 01:45:23.532
Dastan.

01:45:23.663 --> 01:45:27.142
Royal blood or not,
he's every bit a son to our father.

01:45:27.334 --> 01:45:30.314
Every bit a brother to Garsiv and me.

01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:33.425
The true prince of Persia.

01:45:37.725 --> 01:45:40.925
Get up there,
before I take your place.

01:45:45.904 --> 01:45:48.184
Hello, princess.

01:45:49.659 --> 01:45:53.799
It's a customary to accompany
a proposal with gifts but, uh...

01:45:54.015 --> 01:45:58.120
I was surprised and unless I'm unprepared.

01:45:58.334 --> 01:46:01.984
I've nothing for you, save...

01:46:02.179 --> 01:46:05.858
that which is already yours.

01:46:16.784 --> 01:46:20.544
Walk with me, prince Dastan.

01:46:28.134 --> 01:46:31.534
How can I trust the man who
breached the walls of my city?

01:46:31.718 --> 01:46:35.163
But I'm starting to think that I'm no longer
the same man who breached those walls.

01:46:35.354 --> 01:46:38.354
That's a short time for
the man to change so much.

01:46:38.520 --> 01:46:41.044
Perhaps.

01:46:43.907 --> 01:46:46.447
It sounds as
if you've discovered something here.

01:46:46.594 --> 01:46:51.099
- What might that be?
- The new spiritual awareness.

01:46:51.330 --> 01:46:54.460
- A destiny.
- Yes, exactly.

01:46:54.632 --> 01:46:57.832
I believe we make
our own destiny, princess.

01:46:58.008 --> 01:47:00.337
You have an unfortunate lack of curiosity.

01:47:00.474 --> 01:47:03.874
- With no doubt, one of my many flaws.
- Please don't mock me, prince.

01:47:06.108 --> 01:47:09.708
I hardly think we know each other
well enough for that, princess.

01:47:09.900 --> 01:47:13.785
But I look forward,
to the day that we do.
