WEBVTT

00:04.400 --> 00:07.469
"On the road again"

00:07.504 --> 00:11.383
"I just can't wait
to get on the road again"

00:11.418 --> 00:15.863
"The life I love is
making music with my friends"

00:15.898 --> 00:17.782
Uh, hold it a minute.

00:17.817 --> 00:21.946
Uh, a little less harmonica
in the monitor and a little more bass.

00:21.981 --> 00:23.768
Please.
Sure thing, Willie.

00:23.803 --> 00:26.718
And a little less light
on the harmonica player, please.

00:26.753 --> 00:28.318
Thank you.

00:30.680 --> 00:33.591
"On the road again"

00:33.626 --> 00:37.482
"I just can't wait
to get on the road again"

00:37.517 --> 00:40.961
"The life I love is
making music with my friends"

00:40.996 --> 00:44.643
"And I can't wait
to get on the road again"

00:44.678 --> 00:47.837
"On the road again"

00:47.872 --> 00:52.016
"Going places
that I've never been"

00:52.051 --> 00:55.399
"Seein' things that
I may never see again"

00:55.434 --> 01:00.318
"And I can't wait
to get on the road again"

01:00.353 --> 01:01.312
Is that enough of it?

01:01.347 --> 01:04.303
Sounds great. Thanks

01:05.467 --> 01:07.092
- Mr. Nelson
- Hello

01:07.127 --> 01:10.324
Willie. I just spoke
to the front office.

01:10.359 --> 01:11.745
Both shows are sold out.

01:11.780 --> 01:12.660
Can't beat that, huh?

01:12.695 --> 01:16.074
No, sir. And I gave your driver
directions to the radio station.

01:16.109 --> 01:17.287
What radio station?

01:17.322 --> 01:19.385
For that interview you have
in the morning. You remember.

01:19.420 --> 01:20.942
All right.
Can you excuse me a minute?

01:20.977 --> 01:23.170
Not a problem.

01:23.205 --> 01:24.164
Will you, uh,
let go of my hand?

01:24.199 --> 01:25.687
I am so sorry.

01:28.194 --> 01:31.410
Put the women's bathroom signs
over the exits.

01:31.445 --> 01:34.780
We can get more people in that way.
I-I gotta go.

01:34.815 --> 01:36.997
Hey, Will. Sorry I'm late.
How'd rehearsal go?

01:37.032 --> 01:39.397
Well, we managed
to get by without you again.

01:39.432 --> 01:40.311
Something wrong?

01:40.346 --> 01:41.538
Yeah, something's wrong.

01:41.573 --> 01:43.341
If it's about the $400
from last night's poker game...

01:43.376 --> 01:45.843
No, it's the $400,000.

01:45.878 --> 01:47.928
The books didn't add up.

01:47.963 --> 01:49.710
Can we go, uh,
talk about this on the bus?

01:49.745 --> 01:52.326
We'll talk about it now.
Are you rippin' me off?

01:52.361 --> 01:54.149
- No.! Is this a joke?
- Nojoke.

01:54.184 --> 01:56.404
I never do the books
till we get back to Austin.

01:56.439 --> 02:00.126
Well, if the books don't add up today,
you won't be goin' back to Austin.

02:02.000 --> 02:08.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:17.397 --> 02:19.977
Now just shut up and listen.
Get all the receipts you can together.

02:20.012 --> 02:23.245
I'll make up the res...
Ah, geez.

02:23.280 --> 02:26.163
Oh, please, calm down.
I gotta go.

02:38.330 --> 02:40.540
Help.! Come quick.!

02:40.575 --> 02:44.183
Help.! Help.! Help.!

02:44.218 --> 02:46.278
Help, somebody!

02:46.313 --> 02:49.296
Somebody help!
I'm in the alley! Come quick!

02:49.331 --> 02:52.208
- Oh, God.!
- Call 9-1-1!

02:52.243 --> 02:54.691
What's goin' on?
Sonny's been shot.

02:54.726 --> 02:57.252
Somebody come quick.!
Oh, God.!

02:57.287 --> 02:59.095
What did you do?

03:06.042 --> 03:11.446
MONK Season 1 Epi. 11
Mr. Monk and the Red-Headed Stranger

03:52.800 --> 03:55.834
No press.
Nobody gets wind of this, okay?

03:58.123 --> 04:00.166
Just bag it until
you get to the lab, okay?

04:00.201 --> 04:01.266
Okay. Who is it?

04:01.301 --> 04:03.117
Mark off that side over there.

04:03.152 --> 04:04.960
I told you, my hours were crazy.

04:04.995 --> 04:06.791
Uh-huh. You know what?

04:06.826 --> 04:08.872
I-I-I just got to the crime scene.

04:08.907 --> 04:10.993
I'll-I'll call you later, okay?

04:11.028 --> 04:13.589
How-How late
are you gonna be up?

04:13.624 --> 04:15.768
All right. Okay.
All right, bye.

04:15.803 --> 04:17.208
- Who was that?
- None of your business.

04:17.243 --> 04:18.959
- Can I take a wild guess?
- You never take wild guesses.

04:18.995 --> 04:21.369
Was it the guy you met
last week at the party... Justin?

04:21.404 --> 04:22.525
Maybe.

04:22.560 --> 04:23.653
When do I get to meet him?

04:23.688 --> 04:25.852
Never, 'cause you ruin everything.

04:25.887 --> 04:28.139
I'm protecting you.

04:28.174 --> 04:29.859
Adrian, you're not my mother.

04:29.894 --> 04:31.095
Look, I checked him out on the Internet.

04:31.130 --> 04:32.899
He's an architect who's won awards.

04:32.934 --> 04:35.065
He's the real deal.

04:35.100 --> 04:35.915
So let me meet him.

04:35.950 --> 04:37.869
We'll invite you to
our tenth anniversary, okay?

04:37.904 --> 04:39.425
Now, will you pay attention?

04:39.460 --> 04:41.531
There's a dead guy over here.

04:41.566 --> 04:42.649
Can we cut the witness loose?

04:42.684 --> 04:46.295
Yes. No, no. Wait, wait.
Uh, no.

04:46.330 --> 04:48.198
No, we better not.

04:48.233 --> 04:49.404
Sir, the building next door
has a security camera.

04:49.439 --> 04:51.025
Maybe we could have a look at the tape.

04:51.060 --> 04:53.297
Yes, good idea.
Talk to the owner.

04:53.332 --> 04:55.606
Wouldn't we need
a court order for that?

04:55.641 --> 04:58.048
Right.
I'll take care of that later.

04:58.083 --> 05:00.196
- Monk.
- Where's the captain?

05:00.231 --> 05:02.191
He's getting an X ray.
He was in an accident.

05:02.226 --> 05:05.002
- Is he okay? - He fell off his
motorcycle. That's all I know.

05:05.037 --> 05:06.805
Until he gets back, I'm in charge.

05:06.840 --> 05:08.193
Oh, my God.

05:08.228 --> 05:09.711
I'm so glad you're here.

05:09.746 --> 05:11.612
Monk, listen. This is big.

05:11.647 --> 05:13.848
In fact, this could be the big one.

05:13.883 --> 05:16.173
We have a suspect inside.

05:16.208 --> 05:17.783
It's Willie Nelson.

05:17.818 --> 05:19.518
The Red-headed Stranger?

05:19.553 --> 05:21.291
The press hasn't got wind
of it yet, so just...

05:21.326 --> 05:23.988
Can I... Can I...
Can I talk to him?

05:24.023 --> 05:25.093
You like Willie Nelson?

05:25.128 --> 05:26.391
Are you surprised?

05:26.426 --> 05:28.914
Well, yeah.
It's just so... so normal.

05:28.949 --> 05:33.711
Willie's inside, and he's not talking
to anyone until his lawyers get here.

05:33.746 --> 05:35.927
If you want,
you can meet his road manager.

05:35.962 --> 05:38.238
Say hello to Sonny Cross.

05:38.273 --> 05:39.995
We found this
on the front door...

05:40.030 --> 05:41.918
to lure him into the alley.

05:41.953 --> 05:44.007
What does the "J" stand for?

05:44.042 --> 05:45.969
His legal name was Jason Cross.

05:46.004 --> 05:47.226
Look at this.

05:47.261 --> 05:50.532
Shot one through the collarbone,
shot two straight in the back...

05:50.567 --> 05:52.238
while he was running away.

05:52.273 --> 05:53.914
We have a witness, Monk,

05:53.949 --> 05:58.454
who heard Willie Nelson and Cross arguing
just before the shots were fired.

05:58.489 --> 06:01.194
We found the gun
over there behind the Dumpster.

06:01.229 --> 06:05.104
It's a Webley...
a Mark I.38-caliber. No prints.

06:05.139 --> 06:06.123
An old Webley?

06:06.158 --> 06:08.511
Yes. We can rule out
a mugging.

06:14.604 --> 06:16.576
What's he doing?

06:16.611 --> 06:18.966
What are you doing?

06:19.001 --> 06:21.313
The bullet hole in the jacket
lines up with the entry wound.

06:21.348 --> 06:22.678
So?

06:22.713 --> 06:23.903
Well, you said they were arguing.

06:23.938 --> 06:28.115
But if he was animated, if his hands
were up or he was gesturing,

06:28.150 --> 06:31.800
then the holes wouldn't match up.

06:31.835 --> 06:35.865
No, this man had his hands
down at his sides.

06:35.900 --> 06:39.932
And he-he wasn't frightened either.
He...

06:39.967 --> 06:41.527
You say there was an eyewitness?

06:41.562 --> 06:44.363
Well, not exactly an eyewitness.

06:44.398 --> 06:46.880
Her name's Wendy Mass.

06:46.915 --> 06:48.624
She's been blind
since she was 16.

06:48.659 --> 06:51.760
She lives in one of those assisted
living places up on Mountain View.

06:51.795 --> 06:56.144
Oh, my God. I know her.
I've seen her in the park.

06:58.005 --> 07:00.252
That's your witness?

07:00.287 --> 07:03.329
She said she heard
the whole thing.

07:03.364 --> 07:05.484
Lieutenant, from here
it looks like your hands are empty.

07:05.519 --> 07:09.049
Excuse me? - You're not
holding a warrant, are you?

07:09.084 --> 07:11.256
- No, I'm not.
- Then we're finished here.

07:11.291 --> 07:13.635
I just wanna make sure
that we have all the details.

07:13.670 --> 07:15.457
What more do you want?

07:15.492 --> 07:17.796
Our client has given you
his statement three times already.

07:17.831 --> 07:18.911
It's okay, Josh.

07:18.946 --> 07:21.539
I'm as anxious to get this thing
cleared up as you are.

07:21.574 --> 07:23.807
Thank you.
Now, Mr. Nelson,

07:23.842 --> 07:26.438
you admit that you and Mr. Cross
were arguing yesterday?

07:26.473 --> 07:27.705
We argue all the time.

07:27.740 --> 07:28.693
About what?

07:28.728 --> 07:31.608
Only two things to argue about,
and money is one of'em.

07:31.643 --> 07:33.776
And you were coming here
to do a radio interview?

07:33.811 --> 07:34.987
We've already been over this.

07:35.022 --> 07:37.028
It's okay. He's just doin' his job.

07:37.063 --> 07:39.617
Look, Lieutenant, I got out of the car,
I heard some shots,

07:39.652 --> 07:41.262
went around the corner into the alley,

07:41.297 --> 07:42.729
Sonny was layin' dead.

07:42.764 --> 07:45.176
- I couldn't believe it.
- Was anybody else in the alley?

07:45.211 --> 07:47.928
There was this lady with a cane.

07:47.963 --> 07:48.982
Uh, she could've been blind.

07:49.017 --> 07:51.057
She was screamin'
at the top of her voice.

07:51.092 --> 07:53.787
She had a great set of lungs,
I know that.

07:53.822 --> 07:57.485
Well, thank you very much.
That's all I need for now.

07:57.520 --> 08:00.878
Excuse me, Mr. Willie...
Wilson... Nelson.

08:00.913 --> 08:03.602
- I just have one question.
- Who the hell are you?

08:03.637 --> 08:06.381
- I'm Adrian Monk.
- And what department are you with?

08:06.416 --> 08:07.685
Mr. Monk isn't on the force.

08:07.720 --> 08:10.659
He's here as a consultant
at my request.

08:10.694 --> 08:13.979
First of all, I just wanna say...

08:14.014 --> 08:16.502
I'm-I'm your second biggest fan.

08:16.537 --> 08:20.009
- Well, who's the first?
- Uh, that-that'd be my wife.

08:20.044 --> 08:22.692
I lost her about five years ago.

08:22.727 --> 08:24.078
I'm sorry to hear that, Mr. Monk.

08:24.113 --> 08:27.164
No, I just wanted to tell you...

08:27.199 --> 08:30.680
how much your music has meant
to me and to my wife.

08:30.715 --> 08:32.980
This isn't a fan club.
Just ask your question.

08:33.015 --> 08:34.895
- Right.
- Come on.

08:34.929 --> 08:37.856
How long did you know Jason?

08:37.890 --> 08:40.200
- Who the hell's Jason?
- Uh, I'm sorry.

08:40.235 --> 08:42.475
- I mean Sonny.
- I forgot his real name.

08:42.510 --> 08:45.605
About 18 and a half years
on and off, mostly off.

08:45.640 --> 08:49.690
All right. Enough is enough.
Come on, Willie.

08:49.725 --> 08:53.203
- You know where to reach us.
- Yes, I do.

08:53.238 --> 08:55.110
- Randy, you got a second?
- What?

08:55.145 --> 08:57.486
Look. Look again.

08:57.521 --> 09:00.127
"J" Cross.

09:00.162 --> 09:06.596
Whoever wrote this knew Sonny
by his legal name, not his nickname.

09:06.631 --> 09:07.735
So?

09:07.770 --> 09:10.844
I don't think Willie did it.

09:10.879 --> 09:12.147
Monk, he was shot twice...

09:12.182 --> 09:15.030
once in the back 20 feet away.
It wasn't the blind lady.

09:15.065 --> 09:17.780
Then there must've been
somebody else in that alley.

09:20.728 --> 09:23.515
Now, Mrs. Mass,
you said you were taking the bus.

09:23.550 --> 09:24.720
That's right.

09:24.755 --> 09:27.906
I was visiting a friend,
and I missed my stop.

09:27.941 --> 09:31.101
I never like to admit it,
but it happens.

09:31.136 --> 09:34.130
So I got off, and I started to walk.

09:34.165 --> 09:35.950
Then I turned down that alley,

09:35.985 --> 09:39.336
thinking that I could cut through to
4th Avenue, but it was blocked off.

09:39.371 --> 09:42.249
- Well, the alley was a dead...
- Oh, yeah. There was construction.

09:42.284 --> 09:43.137
It's a dead end.

09:43.172 --> 09:46.650
Dead end. Exactly.
So I started to turn around,

09:46.685 --> 09:48.807
and then I heard
these two men arguing.

09:48.842 --> 09:52.142
- Uh, about what?
- I couldn't tell.

09:52.177 --> 09:55.809
They were very angry.
And then I heard...

09:55.844 --> 09:59.304
these two shots...
bang, bang.

10:00.173 --> 10:03.434
Well, my heart was pounding,
and I couldn't move.

10:03.469 --> 10:06.529
Then this one man came up to me
and he said,

10:06.564 --> 10:11.090
"Tell anybody about this
and I'll kill you."

10:14.462 --> 10:15.781
Adrian.

10:15.816 --> 10:17.365
How's it going?

10:17.400 --> 10:20.740
Miss Mass, this is
Captain Stottlemeyer.

10:20.775 --> 10:22.250
Mrs. Mass, how do you do?

10:22.285 --> 10:25.212
He'll be in charge of the case
from here on in, thank God.

10:25.247 --> 10:26.880
Good job, Lieutenant.

10:26.915 --> 10:28.937
- Oh, thank you, sir.
- You're welcome.

10:28.972 --> 10:31.556
- Sharona./ Hey, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

10:31.591 --> 10:33.680
His arm's in a sling.

10:33.715 --> 10:35.338
Oh. Sorry.

10:35.373 --> 10:36.192
What happened?

10:36.227 --> 10:37.756
It's nothing. I fell off my motorcycle.

10:37.791 --> 10:40.519
I was on the dirt trails
north of Highway 18.

10:40.554 --> 10:42.341
Slipped on a bunch
of wet leaves.

10:42.376 --> 10:45.263
It could've been a lot worse.
You're a very lucky man, sir.

10:45.298 --> 10:47.447
Yeah, well,
I don't feel like a lucky man.

10:47.482 --> 10:48.847
It's a feeding frenzy out there.

10:48.882 --> 10:51.021
We've gotta be very careful
how we handle this one.

10:51.056 --> 10:52.182
Yes, sir.
So what's the plan?

10:52.217 --> 10:53.076
Are you okay?

10:53.111 --> 10:56.450
Well, you know how they handled
the O. J. Case down in Los Angeles?

10:56.485 --> 10:59.041
We do the opposite.

10:59.076 --> 11:00.390
Where are we?

11:00.425 --> 11:02.333
Uh, same as I told you
on the phone, sir.

11:02.368 --> 11:07.075
Mrs. Mass is reasonably sure that
she can recognize the assailant's voice.

11:07.110 --> 11:09.504
"Reasonably sure"?

11:09.539 --> 11:11.105
Excuse me, Mrs. Mass?

11:11.140 --> 11:12.637
Do you listen to country and western music?

11:12.672 --> 11:14.346
No, I like classical.

11:14.381 --> 11:16.409
Okay, good.
Bring him in.

11:18.384 --> 11:20.950
Captain,

11:20.985 --> 11:25.624
I wouldn't tell that story about
your accident to too many people.

11:25.659 --> 11:26.647
Why not?

11:26.682 --> 11:30.267
Well, the hills north of Highway 18
have been closed for two weeks.

11:30.302 --> 11:32.705
Brush fires.

11:32.740 --> 11:35.028
Really?

11:35.063 --> 11:37.648
What really happened?

11:37.683 --> 11:40.390
I was cleaning my gutters and slipped,
fell off the ladder.

11:40.425 --> 11:41.837
Oh.

11:41.872 --> 11:44.168
We're ready, sir.

11:49.364 --> 11:52.087
Now, Mrs. Mass,

11:52.122 --> 11:54.174
I want you to take your time,

11:54.209 --> 11:57.229
and I want you to listen
very carefully, okay?

11:57.264 --> 11:58.145
- All right.
- You all right?

11:58.180 --> 12:00.138
- Yes.
- Good.

12:01.052 --> 12:02.828
All right, number one, please.

12:08.770 --> 12:12.744
Tell anybody about this
and I'll kill you.

12:12.779 --> 12:14.614
No, no.

12:14.649 --> 12:16.154
Number two.

12:19.443 --> 12:22.149
Tell anybody about this
and I'll kill you.

12:22.184 --> 12:25.092
No.

12:25.127 --> 12:27.563
And number three.
Read the line, please.

12:30.091 --> 12:32.615
Tell anybody about this
and I'll kill you.

12:32.650 --> 12:35.638
That's him. That-That's the voice.
That's him.

12:35.673 --> 12:37.634
- Now, you're sure?
- That's him.

12:37.669 --> 12:39.663
I know that's him.

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
This investigation
is open and ongoing.

12:49.035 --> 12:52.576
We have at least one witness,
and there is some physical evidence...

12:52.611 --> 12:54.236
which is being analyzed as we speak.

12:54.271 --> 12:56.030
Captain, is Willie Nelson a suspect?

12:56.065 --> 12:58.764
We haven't ruled out anybody
as of yet. That's all I can say.

12:58.799 --> 13:00.679
Has Mr. Nelson made a statement?

13:00.714 --> 13:03.211
Mr. Nelson has been very cooperative.

13:03.246 --> 13:07.007
He's agreed to stay in town and remain
available to us at our discretion.

13:07.042 --> 13:08.628
Now, I wanna stress this again.

13:08.663 --> 13:12.382
We have not accused or charged
anyone of this crime.

13:12.417 --> 13:14.190
Whoo-hoo.!

13:18.045 --> 13:21.061
- Whoo!
- What the hell was that?

13:21.096 --> 13:23.840
That was a streaker, sir.

13:23.875 --> 13:27.265
What is this, 1974?

13:27.300 --> 13:29.642
Oh, yeah!

13:31.792 --> 13:34.043
Well, if there are no
further questions...

13:36.523 --> 13:38.787
We'll be going. Thank you.

13:39.804 --> 13:41.869
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Justin, hold on. Hold on.

13:41.904 --> 13:44.092
One sec.

13:44.127 --> 13:47.421
Adrian. Adrian,
you're gonna have a heart attack.

13:47.456 --> 13:53.240
I can't believe he called me.
Willie Nelson called me.

13:53.275 --> 13:56.981
Okay, will you just relax?
He's just... Adrian,

13:57.016 --> 13:59.417
he's just a regular guy
who happens to sing and play guitar.

13:59.452 --> 14:03.606
No, he's not!
You take that back.

14:03.641 --> 14:06.576
Okay. Okay, here he is.
Here-Here he comes.

14:06.611 --> 14:08.575
Okay, just act natural.
Okay.

14:08.610 --> 14:10.836
- Justin, hold on...Just hold on.
- Be cool.

14:10.871 --> 14:13.909
Hold on.
It might be him.

14:20.967 --> 14:24.867
False alarm. Oh, God.
I wish... I wish you were here.

14:24.902 --> 14:27.875
My boss is tryin' to act cool,
and he is totally hyperventilating.

14:27.910 --> 14:29.906
Okay, now he's gonna block
the street. - All right, Justin...

14:29.941 --> 14:32.965
We're gonna miss him now. - Okay, just
let me...let me call you back later.

14:33.000 --> 14:37.048
- Excuse me! This is not a bus stop!
- Adrian, please! Please!

14:37.083 --> 14:39.201
- I'm waiting for Willie!
- He's not blocking the road.

14:39.236 --> 14:41.072
Hello, Mr. Monk.

14:41.107 --> 14:43.704
Sorry we're late.
Come on in.

14:43.739 --> 14:45.265
All right.

14:51.954 --> 14:53.410
Thanks for comin'.

14:53.445 --> 14:57.913
My lawyer tells me that you're about
the only friend I got left in town.

14:57.948 --> 14:59.392
Do you smell that?

14:59.427 --> 15:02.516
Uh, no, I don't,
and you don't either.

15:02.551 --> 15:03.856
I don't either.

15:05.816 --> 15:07.948
This is a little piece
of Texas on wheels.

15:07.983 --> 15:08.949
I love it.

15:08.984 --> 15:10.856
It's the bomb.

15:10.891 --> 15:13.532
"It's the bomb"?

15:13.567 --> 15:16.645
Bomb is good.
It's good.

15:16.680 --> 15:20.700
Willie, uh,
if you wouldn't mind.

15:20.735 --> 15:23.559
Where in the world did you get that?
I haven't seen that one in a long time.

15:23.594 --> 15:25.608
I have 'em all.

15:25.643 --> 15:28.422
And if you could just...
if you could make it out to Trudy.

15:28.457 --> 15:30.471
- Sure.
- She worshipped you.

15:30.506 --> 15:33.522
On our first date,
we went to see one of your shows.

15:33.557 --> 15:35.150
It was the Shoreline Amphitheater.

15:35.185 --> 15:37.329
Yeah, I remember y'all.
You were sittin' on this blue blanket.

15:37.364 --> 15:39.397
- Really?
- No, I'm just kiddin'.

15:39.432 --> 15:43.689
Oh, he's...
Willie's jokin'.

15:43.724 --> 15:45.329
Hey, the bus is moving now.

15:45.364 --> 15:50.004
Mm-hmm. It's gonna do that.
Sit down.

15:50.039 --> 15:53.536
- There you go.
- Thank you.

16:03.505 --> 16:06.187
- One more card,
- down and dirty.

16:12.205 --> 16:15.667
So it's up to me?
Three dollars.

16:15.702 --> 16:20.083
Well, I think you're tryin' to buy it.
I don't believe you got that deuce.

16:20.118 --> 16:22.869
- He's not bluffing.
- What?

16:22.904 --> 16:27.959
- It's okay. It's a friendly game.
- He's not bluffing. He's got the deuce.

16:28.693 --> 16:30.869
Fold.

16:30.904 --> 16:35.180
I fold. What do you got?
What do you want for that?

16:35.215 --> 16:38.082
- How'd you know that?
- When you looked at your card,

16:38.117 --> 16:39.802
you started to hum that song
"Deuce's Wild"

16:39.837 --> 16:40.779
from the "Yesterday's Wine" album.

16:40.814 --> 16:43.765
- You played stand-up bass on that cut.
- Did you play on that?

16:43.800 --> 16:47.532
He sat in for three songs on that album.
I believe that was the first time...

16:47.567 --> 16:49.925
you used a stand-up bass
in the studio.

16:49.960 --> 16:52.090
You know more about me than I do.

16:52.125 --> 16:54.709
He knows more about
everybody than they do.

16:54.744 --> 16:57.196
Well, why do they think I shot Sonny?

16:57.231 --> 16:59.493
Um, well,

16:59.528 --> 17:01.342
you gotta admit
it looks pretty bad.

17:01.377 --> 17:04.160
The blind lady said that
she heard everything.

17:04.194 --> 17:06.036
The blind lady's lyin'.

17:06.070 --> 17:07.972
- Why was she lying?
- I don't know.

17:08.007 --> 17:09.804
I do a lot of things,
but I wouldn't hurt anybody.

17:09.839 --> 17:12.290
I might write a bad song about 'em.

17:12.325 --> 17:15.857
And as far as Sonny was concerned,
maybe I should've fired him

17:15.892 --> 17:19.894
a long time ago, but there's
a bunch more I could've fired too.

17:19.929 --> 17:23.461
Is-Is that a Rosewood?

17:23.496 --> 17:26.044
- Yeah. You play?
- Ah, a little.

17:26.079 --> 17:28.799
Oh, he's just being modest.
No, he's very good.

17:28.834 --> 17:31.533
I've never... never played
a Rosewood clarinet.

17:31.568 --> 17:33.183
That's...
That is a beautiful thing.

17:33.218 --> 17:35.552
Well, come over and kick the tires.

17:39.873 --> 17:41.267
- Um, Willie?
- Yeah.

17:41.302 --> 17:44.557
Adrian can't play
somebody else's instrument.

17:44.592 --> 17:46.873
He, uh, has a little problem
with germs.

17:46.908 --> 17:51.644
I got a brand-new mouthpiece right there,
untouched by human lips.

18:16.778 --> 18:18.560
- Very nice.
- You think so?

18:18.595 --> 18:20.172
Do you know
"Georgia On My Mind"?

18:20.207 --> 18:21.731
Oh. Sure.

18:21.766 --> 18:24.503
Tomorrow night we're doing
this radio concert.

18:24.538 --> 18:27.675
My agent thought it might be
a good idea for publicity or whatever.

18:27.710 --> 18:31.558
We're gonna do "Georgia On My Mind."
Would you like to come over and play?

18:31.593 --> 18:33.571
You-You mean play with the band?

18:33.606 --> 18:35.095
Yeah. You think about it.

18:35.130 --> 18:38.548
No, no, I'd better not.
If I think about it, I might say no.

18:51.592 --> 18:54.953
- Honey, do your homework.
- I can't concentrate.

18:54.988 --> 18:58.337
I know, but he has to practice. He's
gonna be on the radio with Willie Nelson.

18:58.372 --> 19:00.811
- Who's Willie Nelson?
- He's a country singer.

19:00.846 --> 19:02.309
Has he ever been on MTV?

19:02.344 --> 19:04.457
- No, but he's been on the news.
- What for?

19:04.492 --> 19:07.425
Well, according to the I. R. S.,
when he was a little boy,

19:07.460 --> 19:09.543
he didn't do his math homework.

19:09.578 --> 19:13.087
I think I got it.
Listen to this.

19:13.122 --> 19:17.307
Adrian, will you give it a break? Benjy
could play this song by now. Come on.

19:19.539 --> 19:22.662
- Did you really meet a blind lady?
- Yeah.

19:22.697 --> 19:25.114
- Does she have a dog?
- No, she had a cane.

19:25.149 --> 19:28.002
Hey, maybe I can interview her
for that report

19:28.037 --> 19:30.107
I have to do on people with disabilities.

19:30.142 --> 19:32.065
Wait. I thought
you were gonna write about...

19:32.100 --> 19:35.317
It only has to be two pages.
Mr. Monk is a whole book.

19:35.352 --> 19:37.730
You know what? I'll ask her.

19:42.097 --> 19:44.587
Will you stop it? Stop!

19:45.864 --> 19:47.404
Adrian!

19:48.136 --> 19:49.810
Hello?

19:51.539 --> 19:53.580
Uh... Adrian!

19:53.615 --> 19:57.299
Yes, yes, um, right.
We'll be there right away.

19:58.372 --> 20:02.091
Adrian. Adrian! That was Stottlemeyer.
He wants to see us right away.

20:02.126 --> 20:05.120
Should I bring my clarinet?
I could practice in the car.

20:06.305 --> 20:09.469
I'll just leave it right here.

20:13.636 --> 20:15.491
Close the door.

20:15.526 --> 20:18.192
What you are about to see
cannot leave this room.

20:18.227 --> 20:20.717
The tabloids would pay
a million dollars for this videotape.

20:20.752 --> 20:24.739
It's from the surveillance camera
near the crime scene.

20:26.550 --> 20:29.310
The alley's a dead end.
This is the only way in.

20:29.345 --> 20:30.948
The side door to the radio station

20:30.983 --> 20:33.850
was wired to an alarm,
so we know it wasn't opened.

20:33.885 --> 20:35.687
Bottom line, we can tell for sure...

20:35.722 --> 20:38.788
who was or was not there.

20:39.869 --> 20:41.856
What the hell are you doing?

20:43.552 --> 20:45.842
Oh, uh, he's practicing.

20:45.877 --> 20:46.876
Really?

20:46.911 --> 20:49.277
Willie Nelson invited him
to sit in with his band.

20:49.312 --> 20:51.555
Well, he may be live
from Folsom Prison.

20:51.590 --> 20:54.396
Check this out.
Go ahead.

20:55.330 --> 20:57.392
Yeah, there goes Mrs. Mass.
Tap, tap, tap.

20:57.427 --> 21:01.416
She goes into the alley.
Fast-forward.

21:03.892 --> 21:07.850
And there goes the soon-to-be-late
Sonny Cross.

21:07.885 --> 21:09.936
And there goes Willie Nelson.

21:09.971 --> 21:13.400
Nobody else goes in or out.
Pretty much a slam dunk.

21:13.435 --> 21:14.290
Are you gonna arrest him?

21:14.325 --> 21:15.756
D. A. 's ready to move.

21:15.791 --> 21:18.108
I'm waiting for some tests from the lab.

21:18.143 --> 21:19.721
Maybe tomorrow.

21:19.756 --> 21:21.624
Call your mom.
Tell her to set the V. C. R.

21:21.659 --> 21:23.210
We're gonna be on the 6:00 news.

21:23.245 --> 21:26.785
Captain, what about
the note on the door?

21:26.820 --> 21:29.055
My videotape trumps your note.
Ask any lawyer.

21:29.090 --> 21:32.303
- I don't know.
- Monk, look.

21:32.338 --> 21:35.536
My heroes have always been
cowboys too.

21:35.571 --> 21:39.818
It's either "A," the blind woman,
who has zero motive,

21:39.853 --> 21:41.787
or it's "B," your buddy,
the Red-headed Stranger.

21:41.822 --> 21:44.075
Who had motive, means and opportunity...

21:44.110 --> 21:46.674
and was identified by
the only witness at the scene.

21:46.709 --> 21:49.554
-"A" or "B," Monk?
- I think it's "C."

21:49.589 --> 21:53.437
- "C"? What the hell is "C"?
- I don't know yet.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.742
So he just wants to ask you
a couple of questions.

22:04.777 --> 22:06.714
I don't mind.
I love children.

22:06.749 --> 22:11.471
430, 431.431 cereal boxes.
That's a prime number

22:12.997 --> 22:15.353
- Now, is there anything else you need?
- Let's see.

22:15.388 --> 22:18.122
Mushroom soup.
It's in the next aisle.

22:19.356 --> 22:23.692
Uh, Mrs. Mass,
I have a few questions.

22:23.727 --> 22:26.573
How did you know
the alley was there?

22:26.608 --> 22:28.411
I have a lot of friends
in that neighborhood.

22:28.446 --> 22:30.988
I've lived in San Francisco
for 17 years.

22:31.023 --> 22:34.626
- The soup should be right up here.
- Oh, I got it.

22:34.661 --> 22:36.674
Thank you.

22:36.709 --> 22:38.779
I peel back the corner.

22:38.814 --> 22:42.592
That way I can tell
which can is which when I get home.

22:42.627 --> 22:45.343
I got a hundred little tricks.

22:45.378 --> 22:48.908
Let's see. Oh, juice.
Excuse me.

22:48.943 --> 22:51.952
Should be...

22:51.987 --> 22:54.162
- Yeah. Is this apple?
- Yep.

22:54.197 --> 22:56.676
- Okay. Then we're done.
- Mrs. Mass,

22:56.711 --> 23:00.064
are you certain that there was
no one else in the alley?

23:00.099 --> 23:03.568
Maybe someone hiding
behind the Dumpster?

23:03.603 --> 23:06.953
Well, I didn't hear anybody,
and I didn't sense anybody.

23:06.988 --> 23:09.500
And I'm not easy to fool.

23:09.535 --> 23:11.985
Mr. Monk, I'm sorry
about Willie Nelson.

23:12.020 --> 23:14.315
I'm sure he's
a very talented singer.

23:14.350 --> 23:16.947
But I was there.
He did it.

23:16.982 --> 23:19.874
- Hey, there, Mrs. Mass.
- Hello, Janice.

23:19.909 --> 23:22.797
Well, as you can see,
I didn't need you this time.

23:22.832 --> 23:26.189
This is Mr. Monk...
And his friend Sharona Fleming.

23:26.224 --> 23:27.534
- Hey, how are you?
- Hi. How are you?

23:27.569 --> 23:31.147
That comes to $25.88.

23:31.182 --> 23:36.170
Here's a 20, and there's a 10.

23:36.205 --> 23:37.524
I'm telling you,
she's an amazing woman.

23:37.559 --> 23:39.971
I'm not just saying that
because she didn't sue us.

23:40.006 --> 23:41.573
She didn't sue you?

23:41.608 --> 23:45.706
Well, I had a little accident
in the produce section last year.

23:45.741 --> 23:47.305
I slipped in a puddle of water.

23:47.340 --> 23:50.103
A little accident?
She had a concussion.

23:50.138 --> 23:52.046
We had to call the ambulance
and everything.

23:52.081 --> 23:54.989
It was just a little bump.
I was fine.

23:56.805 --> 23:58.848
What's all this?

23:58.883 --> 24:02.758
It's for Saturday night.
I'm cooking dinner for Justin.

24:02.793 --> 24:05.262
Maybe I should drop by.

24:05.297 --> 24:06.741
Adrian, I love my job,

24:06.776 --> 24:10.400
but if I have to get
a restraining order, I will.

24:10.435 --> 24:12.513
Okay?

24:19.939 --> 24:21.298
Where'd you get that?

24:21.333 --> 24:23.240
I borrowed it from Benjy.
Okay.

24:23.275 --> 24:26.957
This is where it happened.
So, I'm the killer.

24:26.992 --> 24:28.780
You're Sonny Cross.

24:28.815 --> 24:31.000
Okay, I'm hiding.

24:31.035 --> 24:34.164
- There is so much garbage back here.
- Oh, please.

24:34.199 --> 24:36.281
Okay, here I am.
I'm hiding.

24:36.316 --> 24:39.214
You walk up the alley.
I jump out.

24:39.249 --> 24:41.182
I step up to you and...

24:41.217 --> 24:42.543
- bang!
- Ow!

24:42.578 --> 24:44.154
Why am I always the victim?

24:44.189 --> 24:47.646
Because the victim usually ends up
on the ground in-in the dirt,

24:47.681 --> 24:50.579
and I'm-I'm me.

24:50.614 --> 24:54.113
Okay, so now you've been shot,
so now you run away.

24:54.148 --> 24:55.535
With pleasure.

24:56.978 --> 25:00.274
And here comes the second shot.

25:00.309 --> 25:05.617
Ow! You know...
Give me that gun.

25:05.652 --> 25:07.092
This is ridiculous.

25:07.127 --> 25:09.815
Okay, the first shot
was point-blank.

25:09.850 --> 25:11.986
Even the blind woman

25:12.021 --> 25:14.352
could've done that one.

25:14.387 --> 25:17.102
But the second shot...

25:17.137 --> 25:20.569
The second shot...

25:20.604 --> 25:22.949
20 feet away,

25:22.984 --> 25:26.212
a moving target...

25:26.247 --> 25:28.102
Impossible.

25:30.008 --> 25:32.120
So it had to be Willie Nelson.

25:32.155 --> 25:34.724
I don't think so.

25:34.759 --> 25:37.180
Then what do you think?

25:37.215 --> 25:40.729
I think we need to learn more
about Sonny Cross.

25:40.975 --> 25:42.733
Sixty-five dollars?

25:42.768 --> 25:44.994
Gold Mine has it for 40
in better condition.

25:45.029 --> 25:46.543
Then go buy it from Gold Mine.

25:46.578 --> 25:49.225
Go on, go. Leave.

25:49.260 --> 25:50.624
Why are you still in my store?

25:50.659 --> 25:53.444
Look at all these plastic bags.

25:53.479 --> 25:56.509
- You must be in heaven.
- I never heard of these bands.

25:56.544 --> 25:58.840
You never heard of The Ramones?

25:58.875 --> 26:00.599
Oh, yeah, The Ramones.
They are great.

26:00.634 --> 26:01.618
I love that song they do...

26:01.653 --> 26:03.946
about loving that woman
all night long.

26:03.981 --> 26:05.491
Shut up.

26:05.526 --> 26:07.367
Look, if you must manhandle,
at least

26:07.402 --> 26:09.115
put things back
where they came from.

26:09.150 --> 26:09.994
I think I did.

26:10.029 --> 26:12.077
No. You put things back
alphabetically.

26:12.112 --> 26:14.385
But there happens to be
a chronological sub-order.

26:14.420 --> 26:18.304
Now I have to redo the whole section.
Thank you very little.

26:18.339 --> 26:21.037
So, you wanna know
about Sonny Cross, hmm?

26:21.072 --> 26:24.625
Well, he managed these guys for a
while back in '87 till they fired him.

26:24.660 --> 26:25.721
Why?

26:25.756 --> 26:28.535
Same reason these guys
fired him in '82.

26:28.570 --> 26:31.127
He was humping the lead singer's wife.

26:31.162 --> 26:32.252
That cat had nine lives.

26:32.287 --> 26:35.283
Oh, he, uh, he managed
these guys for a while as well.

26:35.318 --> 26:37.459
- They fired him?
- Didn't have a choice.

26:37.494 --> 26:40.241
Hard to handle them
from the Florida State Penitentiary.

26:40.276 --> 26:42.953
Did, uh, two years, I think.
Drinking and driving.

26:42.988 --> 26:45.175
Apparently, he killed a guy.

26:45.210 --> 26:47.419
And now he's been immortalized...

26:47.454 --> 26:49.387
as the man Willie Nelson shot.

26:49.422 --> 26:51.480
Mmm.

26:51.515 --> 26:53.684
- You missed one.
- I didn't...

26:53.719 --> 26:56.864
Oh. You're right.

26:56.899 --> 26:59.995
- Are you two related?
- Why would you say that?

27:07.458 --> 27:09.383
Sir, are you ready for this?

27:09.418 --> 27:11.779
What is this, a game show?

27:11.814 --> 27:14.810
Can't you just walk in here
and say what you have to say?

27:14.845 --> 27:16.703
The droplets
on Willie Nelson's jacket...

27:16.738 --> 27:19.333
human blood from the victim.

27:20.749 --> 27:22.621
Well, he said that
he leaned over the body.

27:22.656 --> 27:24.636
Maybe he got the blood on him then.

27:24.671 --> 27:26.792
The lab is 40% sure...

27:26.827 --> 27:29.676
they're splatter marks
from the actual shooting.

27:29.711 --> 27:32.620
- Forty percent?
- What do you think?

27:32.655 --> 27:35.777
Well, I think it's not exactly
through the hoop, is it?

27:35.812 --> 27:38.214
Okay, the blood is 40%.

27:38.249 --> 27:39.696
Videotape?

27:39.731 --> 27:43.125
- Forty eight percent.
- Voice I. D.?

27:43.160 --> 27:44.900
- Fifteen percent.
- Motive?

27:44.935 --> 27:47.325
- Twenty.
- Well, that's like 123%.

27:47.360 --> 27:50.085
I mean, plus means and opportunity

27:52.346 --> 27:54.502
All right, bring him in.

27:59.715 --> 28:01.007
I have to be crazy.

28:01.042 --> 28:05.807
Be plumb out of my mind...
to arrest Willie Nelson.

28:05.842 --> 28:07.972
We're back. I'm Little Kenny Freedman.

28:08.007 --> 28:10.797
You're listening to Three Chord Monte
on KNGY.

28:10.832 --> 28:13.715
We are very excited
to have live in our studio

28:13.750 --> 28:15.993
the legendary Willie Nelson.

28:16.028 --> 28:17.800
I know you've been reading
a lot about Willie in the papers.

28:17.835 --> 28:20.384
Everybody seems to have an opinion
on "the incident."

28:20.419 --> 28:24.466
But tonight, we're gonna forget
about all that and enjoy the music.

28:24.501 --> 28:26.628
Willie, would you like
to introduce the band?

28:26.663 --> 28:27.959
Yeah, thank you very much.

28:27.994 --> 28:33.204
First of all, on the bass here
from Helodus, Texas, Mr. Bee Spears.

28:33.239 --> 28:34.167
This is your microphone.

28:34.202 --> 28:37.219
Just don't get too close.
Here, I'll show you.

28:37.254 --> 28:41.726
Willie Payne from Alabama,
and our special guest is Adrian Monk...

28:41.761 --> 28:44.379
playing the clarinet
and sittin'in with us on

28:44.414 --> 28:46.982
a Ray Charles standard
that we love to do...

28:47.017 --> 28:50.965
called "Georgia On My Mind."

28:54.667 --> 28:58.413
"Georgia"
"Georgia"

28:58.448 --> 29:00.223
Excuse me.
We have to stop.

29:00.258 --> 29:02.760
- We can't stop. We're live.
- No, my friend can't play now.

29:02.795 --> 29:08.579
That guy just put his lips
on his clarinet.

29:08.614 --> 29:13.681
"And just an old sweet song keeps Georgia"

29:13.716 --> 29:15.736
"On my mind"

29:21.380 --> 29:24.996
"Georgia"

29:25.031 --> 29:28.009
"Georgia"

29:28.044 --> 29:32.736
"A song of you"

29:32.771 --> 29:38.675
"Comes as sweet and clear"

29:38.710 --> 29:42.985
"As moonlight through the pines"

29:43.020 --> 29:44.769
All right, Adrian.

29:56.625 --> 29:58.476
Play it, Adrian.

30:12.597 --> 30:17.537
"Georgia"
"Georgia"

30:17.572 --> 30:20.776
"No peace I find"

30:24.046 --> 30:29.690
"And just an old sweet song
keeps Georgia"

30:29.725 --> 30:36.553
"On my mind"

30:36.588 --> 30:41.190
"And just an old sweet song"

30:41.225 --> 30:47.602
"Keeps Georgia on my mind"

30:47.637 --> 30:53.259
"On my mind"

30:53.294 --> 30:57.320
"On my mind"

31:02.067 --> 31:07.794
"On my mind"

31:12.652 --> 31:14.315
Nice solo.

31:14.350 --> 31:15.767
That's some
mighty good whistlin' there.

31:15.802 --> 31:18.350
- Well, did you have fun?
- It was great.

31:18.385 --> 31:20.686
If there's anything I can do
for you guys. Anything.

31:20.721 --> 31:23.624
- You used to be a cop, right?
- Well, yeah.

31:23.659 --> 31:25.437
Get us a key
to the evidence room.

31:25.472 --> 31:27.692
Yeah.

31:27.727 --> 31:29.067
Willie Nelson?

31:29.102 --> 31:33.541
- I'm Willie Nelson.
- I'm Willie Nelson. - I'm Willie Nelson.

31:34.839 --> 31:38.455
I don't think
they're goin' for it, boys.

31:38.490 --> 31:41.149
Mr. Nelson, we have
a warrant for your arrest

31:41.184 --> 31:42.841
for the premeditated murder...
of Jason "Sonny" Cross.

31:42.876 --> 31:44.282
Captain, this is a mistake.

31:44.317 --> 31:46.122
He is not the guy.

31:46.157 --> 31:49.728
Well, you can't be objective.
You're a member of the damn band.

31:49.763 --> 31:51.150
Mr. Monk.

31:51.706 --> 31:54.885
This way, Mr. Nelson.
Let's go.

31:59.000 --> 32:03.811
As you know, Willie Hugh Nelson
was arrested at 10:15 last night.

32:03.846 --> 32:07.610
He will be indicted in
Judge Hackman's courtroom tomorrow.

32:07.645 --> 32:10.106
Captain Stottlemeyer
was the arresting officer...

32:10.141 --> 32:12.498
and will be happy to answer
any of your questions.

32:12.533 --> 32:14.997
- Captain.
- Thank you, Jeff.

32:15.032 --> 32:17.885
First of all, I would like to thank
the members of my department

32:17.920 --> 32:19.535
who have been investigating this case.

32:19.570 --> 32:21.047
They've done an outstanding job.

32:21.082 --> 32:23.651
Captain, how strong is your case
against Willie Nelson?

32:23.686 --> 32:26.689
We would not have authorized
this arrest...

32:26.724 --> 32:28.688
unless we were certain

32:28.723 --> 32:31.575
that we have all the facts
for the district attorney...

32:31.610 --> 32:34.003
to successfully prosecute this case.

32:34.038 --> 32:36.923
- Oh! Get a shot of that.
- Hey, hi.!

32:39.203 --> 32:43.749
For the love of...
I want him. Go, go! Get him!

32:48.751 --> 32:51.713
San Francisco.
You gotta love it.

32:59.136 --> 33:01.012
We're on foot,
heading south towards Prospect.

33:01.047 --> 33:02.522
Description?

33:02.557 --> 33:04.007
He's wearing gray sneakers.

33:04.042 --> 33:05.409
Is there anything else?

33:05.444 --> 33:07.236
He's not Jewish!

33:07.271 --> 33:09.025
Come on!

33:13.915 --> 33:15.201
Excuse me.

33:17.004 --> 33:20.271
Oh, yeah. Good boys.

33:24.035 --> 33:25.369
All right, hold it right there!

33:25.404 --> 33:27.511
Stop.! Stop.!
Stay where you are.

33:28.956 --> 33:30.654
All right, we got him.

33:34.317 --> 33:36.732
Streaker in custody.

33:38.993 --> 33:42.959
I've never been interviewed before.
I feel like a celebrity.

33:42.994 --> 33:46.446
Are you ready?
I am clicking on the tape recorder.

33:46.481 --> 33:48.888
Benjy, you don't have to shout.
My hearing's fine.

33:48.923 --> 33:52.488
Sorry. Have you always been blind?

33:52.523 --> 33:56.289
Well, I could see
until I was 16 years old.

33:56.324 --> 33:57.881
I was in a car accident.

33:57.916 --> 34:00.381
I have a question.

34:00.416 --> 34:04.942
Mrs. Mass, the murder weapon
was found behind you near the Dumpster.

34:04.977 --> 34:07.497
Do you have any idea how it got there?

34:07.532 --> 34:11.797
No. I don't remember much.
I was scared to death.

34:11.833 --> 34:14.577
Adrian, this is Benjy's interview.

34:14.612 --> 34:18.938
- Then what am I doing here?
- I don't know. I never know.

34:18.974 --> 34:21.132
How do you know
what to wear every day?

34:21.168 --> 34:22.510
What a good question.

34:22.545 --> 34:26.443
I add special buttons to my clothes
so I can tell 'em apart.

34:26.478 --> 34:28.108
Like this jacket.

34:28.143 --> 34:32.527
I know that it's blue because
the bottom button is square. See?

34:32.562 --> 34:34.246
- Oh, cool.
- Uh-huh.

34:34.282 --> 34:36.281
Did your parents teach you that?

34:36.315 --> 34:40.371
No. My parents were killed
in the same car accident that blinded me.

34:40.407 --> 34:43.243
I lost everything
in one horrible moment.

34:43.277 --> 34:48.072
My sight, my family...
Um, sorry, dear.

34:48.108 --> 34:49.853
- What's next?
- Uh...

34:49.888 --> 34:53.341
Wh-Why do you keep
pictures on your walls?

34:53.376 --> 34:55.568
Oh, they're for visitors like you.

34:55.603 --> 34:57.235
You lived in Florida?

34:57.270 --> 35:00.353
Yes. I grew up in Tampa.

35:01.756 --> 35:03.871
What does it feel like to be blind?

35:03.906 --> 35:09.993
Well, first...
I was always scared.

35:10.028 --> 35:12.169
Then when I turned 20,

35:12.204 --> 35:15.491
I decided that
I wasn't gonna be scared no more.

35:15.526 --> 35:20.505
I accepted it.
Now I feel I can do anything I want.

35:20.540 --> 35:23.677
Well, I think we've taken up
enough of your time, Mrs. Mass.

35:23.712 --> 35:25.656
Thank you so much.

35:27.327 --> 35:29.658
- Thank you, Miss Mass.
- Thank you, Benjy.

35:29.693 --> 35:31.063
Good luck on your report.

35:31.098 --> 35:32.067
Okay, thanks.

35:32.102 --> 35:33.545
- Sharona.
- Thank you.

35:33.580 --> 35:35.374
Thank you so much.

35:35.409 --> 35:38.102
- Mr. Monk.
- Yes, thank you. Thank you very much.

35:43.025 --> 35:45.154
Thank-Thank you very much.

35:45.189 --> 35:47.192
- All right.
- Thank you.

35:47.227 --> 35:50.325
All right. Good day.

36:01.800 --> 36:04.786
Um, Justin? Hi.
It's me, Sharona.

36:04.821 --> 36:09.140
Just give me a call whenever you can.
Okay, bye.

36:09.175 --> 36:13.216
Benjy? Benjy, I need
your notebook and your knapsack.

36:13.251 --> 36:14.152
Okay.

36:20.929 --> 36:22.881
Hello.

36:22.916 --> 36:27.444
I-I just wanna say thank you
for the great job you're doing.

36:34.098 --> 36:37.137
- What are you doing?
- We just solved the case.

36:37.172 --> 36:38.729
I need a wipe.

36:45.763 --> 36:48.246
Lady Godiva, it's your lucky day.

36:48.281 --> 36:50.403
Somebody made your bail.

36:52.869 --> 36:54.805
Lucky.

37:02.672 --> 37:04.353
What's she doing here?

37:04.388 --> 37:06.686
I-I asked her to meet me.

37:08.279 --> 37:10.834
Well, do you mind telling me why?

37:10.869 --> 37:13.657
You'll see. Just wait.

37:19.925 --> 37:22.080
Son of a bitch. He's back.

37:22.115 --> 37:25.020
Lieutenant, call the 23rd.
Get a black-and-white down here A. S. A. P.

37:25.055 --> 37:27.717
- Captain, not so fast.
- What are you talking about?

37:27.752 --> 37:30.579
I bailed him out last night,
and I hired him.

37:30.614 --> 37:33.725
You hired the streaker?
To do what?

37:44.226 --> 37:46.330
Son of a bitch.

37:48.853 --> 37:50.320
She can see.

37:50.355 --> 37:52.762
- She can see?
- She can see.

37:52.797 --> 37:56.208
Son of a bitch.

37:56.243 --> 38:00.416
- Sh-Sharona!
- Justin?

38:00.451 --> 38:02.283
What are you doing here?

38:03.046 --> 38:05.523
Friend of yours?

38:05.558 --> 38:08.148
We're still on
for Saturday, right?

38:13.545 --> 38:17.100
Okay, Mrs. Mass,
when did you get your vision back?

38:17.135 --> 38:20.979
A year ago. - It was your accident
at the supermarket.

38:21.014 --> 38:25.035
When I woke up,
I had regained sight in my left eye.

38:25.070 --> 38:28.984
That's how it happens sometimes...
after a blow to the head.

38:29.019 --> 38:30.251
It was a miracle.

38:30.286 --> 38:32.755
- But you didn't tell anybody?
- No.

38:32.790 --> 38:34.970
No, you kept it a secret.

38:35.005 --> 38:38.980
If people believed you were blind,
you could kill Sonny Cross

38:39.015 --> 38:40.820
and nobody would ever suspect you.

38:40.855 --> 38:44.358
- Why would you wanna kill Sonny Cross?
- Revenge.

38:44.393 --> 38:46.903
He was driving the car
that killed your parents

38:46.938 --> 38:51.251
and left you blind in Tampa...
36 years ago.

38:51.286 --> 38:52.366
You knew he toured a lot.

38:52.401 --> 38:54.462
You waited for him
to come through San Francisco,

38:54.497 --> 38:55.660
and eventually he did.

38:55.695 --> 38:57.315
They announced on the radio that

38:57.350 --> 39:01.122
Willie Nelson and his tour manager
would be stopping by the station.

39:01.157 --> 39:04.408
So you got there early
and put a note on the door.

39:04.443 --> 39:06.710
Then you waited.

39:06.745 --> 39:09.014
Before you killed him,
did you tell him who you were?

39:09.049 --> 39:09.898
Yes.

39:09.933 --> 39:14.386
You killed my parents.
This one is for them.

39:14.421 --> 39:19.101
And you made sure that the second shot
was from 20 feet away,

39:19.136 --> 39:21.067
a crime no blind woman
could have committed.

39:21.102 --> 39:22.806
But then Willie Nelson
showed up in that alley.

39:22.841 --> 39:24.526
You didn't count on that.

39:24.561 --> 39:28.420
- You couldn't just leave the scene, so...
- Help.! Help, somebody.!

39:28.455 --> 39:33.787
- You had to pretend to be a witness...
- Jason Cross...

39:33.822 --> 39:37.831
served a year and a half.

39:37.866 --> 39:40.705
Vehicular manslaughter?

39:40.740 --> 39:42.498
That wasn't justice.

39:42.533 --> 39:47.353
What I did last week,
that was justice.

39:53.172 --> 39:54.593
How did you know?

39:54.628 --> 39:57.356
I knew that Cross
had been arrested in Tampa.

39:57.391 --> 39:59.450
When you mentioned that
you'd grown up there,

39:59.485 --> 40:02.022
it seemed like
a remarkable coincidence.

40:02.057 --> 40:04.343
But I didn't put it together
until I remembered...

40:04.378 --> 40:09.020
something you had done last week
when you met Captain Stottlemeyer.

40:09.055 --> 40:09.846
Me?

40:09.881 --> 40:12.634
When you came in
with your right arm in a sling,

40:12.669 --> 40:16.798
everyone in the room naturally
extended their left hand to shake,

40:16.833 --> 40:18.667
including Mrs. Mass.

40:18.702 --> 40:22.587
This was before anyone mentioned
you had hurt your arm.

40:22.622 --> 40:24.644
So how could she have known...

40:24.679 --> 40:27.971
that you offered your left hand?

40:32.537 --> 40:34.885
- Thank you, Mr. Monk.
- You're thanking him?

40:34.920 --> 40:37.096
I am so relieved.

40:37.131 --> 40:41.304
It was tearing me up inside...that
poor man was taking all the blame.

40:41.339 --> 40:44.376
- You're gonna have to go to prison.
- I understand.

40:44.411 --> 40:49.086
Maybe I can talk to the D. A.
About extenuating circumstances.

40:49.121 --> 40:54.943
- There's only one thing that I want.
- What's that?

40:54.978 --> 40:56.772
A window.

41:03.222 --> 41:07.542
"In the twilight glow I see her"

41:12.291 --> 41:16.920
"Blue eyes cryin' in the rain"

41:20.072 --> 41:24.976
"And when we kissed good-bye
and parted"

41:29.033 --> 41:35.191
"I knew we'd never meet again"

41:37.745 --> 41:41.540
"Love is like a dying ember"

41:46.922 --> 41:50.289
"And only memories remain"

41:54.887 --> 41:59.514
"Through the ages, I'll remember"

42:04.135 --> 42:09.480
"Blue eyes cryin' in the rain"

42:24.863 --> 42:27.979
"Someday we'll meet"

42:31.513 --> 42:36.476
"We'll stroll
hand-in-hand again"

42:39.983 --> 42:44.448
"In a land that knows no parting"

42:46.484 --> 42:50.089
"Blue eyes cryin'"

42:50.124 --> 42:52.878
"In the rain"
