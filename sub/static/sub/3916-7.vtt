00:00.238 --> 00:01.637
Previously on The Fosters...

00:01.689 --> 00:03.730
- Where'd you get the phone?
- Brandon was right.

00:03.737 --> 00:05.470
I'm glad you're back in touch with Ty.

00:05.506 --> 00:07.305
All I ask is that you keep me in the loop.

00:07.341 --> 00:08.407
Mariana...

00:08.442 --> 00:10.308
Ana... she put us all through a lot.

00:10.344 --> 00:12.110
It's gonna take time to trust her.

00:12.146 --> 00:14.229
I would like to buy myself a car.

00:14.281 --> 00:16.030
For now, the answer is no.

00:16.082 --> 00:17.449
Happy Birthday!

00:17.451 --> 00:20.018
I saved it from my
quinceaÃ±era and my allowance...

00:20.053 --> 00:21.219
So you can get a car
that moms will approve.

00:21.271 --> 00:22.988
But what if we bought a car together?

00:23.023 --> 00:23.989
I'm in.

00:24.024 --> 00:25.290
I was talking to my pianist, Jin...

00:25.325 --> 00:27.259
And I said, what a raw
deal I thought you got.

00:27.294 --> 00:29.027
So that means I'm back in?

00:29.062 --> 00:30.779
You had sex with Wyatt?

00:30.814 --> 00:31.963
It only happened once.

00:31.999 --> 00:33.715
And what about lying to me?
Is that a one time thing, too?

00:33.767 --> 00:36.101
"Super Callie?" You're such a dork.

00:41.975 --> 00:44.180
So, what kind of powers
does Super Callie have?

00:44.195 --> 00:45.361
Does she fly?

00:45.363 --> 00:47.429
She doesn't just fly...

00:47.600 --> 00:50.483
It's more like...
gravitational manipulation.

00:52.536 --> 00:54.536
Like riding gravity waves.

00:57.224 --> 00:58.307
Yeah, she flies.

00:59.476 --> 01:02.077
And why do you only...

01:02.112 --> 01:04.146
draw, like, superheroes?

01:04.181 --> 01:05.898
Uh...

01:05.950 --> 01:06.982
I understand those kinda stories.

01:07.001 --> 01:08.867
What? Are you about to
tell me you're like...

01:08.919 --> 01:10.836
- like Captain America or something?
- No.

01:12.790 --> 01:16.675
I guess I just spent a long time hoping that
I'm more than what the world thinks of me.

01:20.681 --> 01:22.064
Well, thank you...

01:22.099 --> 01:24.533
for the... for the drawing.

01:25.736 --> 01:26.885
It's my favorite birthday gift.

01:27.938 --> 01:29.554
It's your favorite?

01:34.678 --> 01:35.677
Wait. Is that him?

01:40.618 --> 01:41.700
Lookin' good, mister man!

01:45.623 --> 01:47.522
Ty, this is Callie.

01:47.574 --> 01:49.424
She's the girl that got
me with her foster family.

01:49.460 --> 01:52.177
I appreciate you lookin'
out for my baby bro, Callie.

01:52.212 --> 01:53.360
It's been hard for him being the less

01:53.361 --> 01:54.961
- handsome Hensdale boy...
- Hey!

01:57.201 --> 01:58.400
It's nice to meet you, Ty.

01:58.435 --> 02:01.903
Um, I'm gonna go meet Mariana,
but I'll see you at home.

02:01.939 --> 02:02.938
All right.

02:07.011 --> 02:08.844
I see you got yourself a little shorty.

02:08.895 --> 02:11.062
Oh, there ain't nothing going on.

02:11.115 --> 02:12.881
So, does she know?

02:12.916 --> 02:14.750
- Know what?
- That we're leaving.

02:20.824 --> 02:21.757
Okay.

02:22.793 --> 02:23.942
I guess these belong to you now.

02:23.978 --> 02:25.661
Ah! Thank you.

02:25.696 --> 02:27.596
Ooh! Don't forget to move
your car for street cleaning.

02:27.631 --> 02:28.730
Those tickets are a racket!

02:28.766 --> 02:30.632
Thank you for the heads up.

02:33.537 --> 02:34.736
Oh, my God!

02:34.788 --> 02:36.538
I can't believe we just bought a car.

02:40.344 --> 02:42.311
So...

02:42.313 --> 02:44.246
What should we name her?

02:44.248 --> 02:46.298
How about "Lucille"?

02:46.350 --> 02:47.432
She looks like a Lucille.

02:47.468 --> 02:49.284
Do you want to break her in?
I could use a ride to work.

02:49.320 --> 02:51.420
Well, I can't drive you
anywhere until we have insurance.

02:51.455 --> 02:54.222
And since we're not 18, that's
gonna require telling Moms.

02:54.258 --> 02:57.025
Okay. Well, do you wanna
break the news then?

02:57.027 --> 02:58.193
Mariana, it's not that simple.

02:58.245 --> 02:59.878
We can't just tell Moms we bought a car,

02:59.913 --> 03:02.297
and then hit them up for money for
insurance. That stuff's expensive.

03:03.901 --> 03:05.100
Okay.

03:05.152 --> 03:06.935
Between the two of us, it
shouldn't take long to save up.

03:06.970 --> 03:09.204
Yeah, until then, Lucille has
to stay parked on the street.

03:09.206 --> 03:11.890
Okay, fine.

03:11.942 --> 03:13.809
I guess I'll just ride the bus.

03:13.844 --> 03:15.777
I guess you will, huh?

03:21.602 --> 03:22.617
Callie, is that you?

03:23.854 --> 03:25.704
- Yeah!
- Could you come here, please?

03:31.729 --> 03:32.677
Hey!

03:34.765 --> 03:36.598
Um... what are you...

03:36.650 --> 03:38.367
We asked Rita to stop by

03:38.369 --> 03:41.203
because we wanted to talk
to her about you and A.J.

03:42.339 --> 03:43.305
Um, what about us?

03:44.408 --> 03:46.475
I saw the two of you kiss, after the party.

03:49.346 --> 03:51.980
Uh... okay, it only happened that once.

03:52.032 --> 03:54.416
And I know that nothing... we can't...

03:54.451 --> 03:56.218
while he's living here, so...

03:56.253 --> 03:57.319
Do you like A.J.?

03:58.989 --> 04:00.205
I don't know how I feel.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.924
But I do know that I
don't want a bunch of...

04:02.960 --> 04:04.059
drama again.

04:04.094 --> 04:05.060
And yet, here we are.

04:06.113 --> 04:07.929
Honey, we just...

04:09.133 --> 04:11.967
We can't risk anything
affecting your adoption.

04:12.019 --> 04:13.785
The only way to protect everyone...

04:13.821 --> 04:14.953
is to separate you and A.J.

04:15.005 --> 04:16.838
You guys can't live in this house together.

04:20.543 --> 04:21.543
So, what are you gonna do?

04:23.000 --> 04:29.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:00.800 --> 05:05.800
- synced and corrected by chamallow -

05:07.491 --> 05:09.558
So, the plan is, we share Jin.

05:09.610 --> 05:11.426
The three of us agreed to a Chinese wall.

05:11.462 --> 05:12.611
No pun intended.

05:12.663 --> 05:14.529
I'm completely neutral.

05:14.565 --> 05:17.616
I promise I won't say anything
about what the other's working on.

05:17.651 --> 05:19.734
You sure you're okay
taking on two composers?

05:19.786 --> 05:20.785
It's a lot of extra work.

05:20.821 --> 05:22.671
It's also two shots to play at Disney Hall.

05:24.408 --> 05:25.407
All right, then.

05:26.827 --> 05:28.410
Welcome back, Brandon.

05:31.548 --> 05:34.666
Thank you for giving me
another shot, guys. Seriously.

05:34.718 --> 05:37.385
This place is crazy and
everyone's so intense.

05:38.655 --> 05:40.622
It's nice to make some real friends.

05:40.657 --> 05:42.390
No worries, man.

05:42.426 --> 05:44.342
We gotta look out for
each other when we can.

05:45.829 --> 05:47.729
Shouldn't he be home by now?

05:47.764 --> 05:49.531
Well, I'm sure he's just running late.

05:51.869 --> 05:53.768
Do you feel like you
need me to stick around?

05:53.770 --> 05:55.520
No, I got it.

05:56.573 --> 05:58.707
And I think it's better
if I talk to him alone.

05:58.742 --> 06:00.442
All right.

06:10.721 --> 06:11.786
Hey!

06:13.457 --> 06:15.724
- Hey!
- How'd it go with Ty?

06:15.759 --> 06:17.359
Um, it was good.

06:18.679 --> 06:19.678
He really wants to meet you,

06:19.713 --> 06:21.379
like we talked about. That's okay, right?

06:21.431 --> 06:22.631
- Yeah.
- All right.

06:22.633 --> 06:24.349
I just want him to see that
you're cool and everything.

06:24.384 --> 06:25.600
Yeah, of course. Any time.

06:25.636 --> 06:27.302
Listen, uh,

06:27.354 --> 06:29.304
there's something else
we need to talk about.

06:32.392 --> 06:35.360
Well, whatever happened to that
girl? What was her name? Kat?

06:35.395 --> 06:37.395
Oh, yeah. Um, she got kicked out

06:37.447 --> 06:38.580
and went back to Toronto.

06:38.615 --> 06:41.316
Wow! So, what's your story, A.J.?

06:41.385 --> 06:42.450
What kind of stuff are you into?

06:42.486 --> 06:44.653
- Um...
- Oh! He's a really good artist.

06:44.655 --> 06:46.705
- Yeah?
- He did this super-awesome

06:46.740 --> 06:48.790
superhero drawing for Callie's birthday.

06:48.825 --> 06:50.325
What did you call her?

06:50.377 --> 06:51.493
Um, Super Callie.

06:52.663 --> 06:54.579
That's funny. Callie,
how's your app coming...

06:54.631 --> 06:56.665
that whole, you know,
work-study independent thing?

06:56.717 --> 06:59.467
Well, it's fine.
Actually, I have to present

06:59.503 --> 07:00.669
for the advisor's board tomorrow.

07:00.671 --> 07:03.638
Fingers crossed. But, no, I'm
like, really excited about it.

07:03.674 --> 07:05.724
I picked up a bunch of coding from Mariana.

07:05.759 --> 07:09.644
That's cool. What's coding?
Seriously. No, what is it?

07:11.348 --> 07:12.597
Well, we have a little
bit of an announcement...

07:12.649 --> 07:14.349
Um...

07:14.384 --> 07:16.351
A.J. is not going to be
staying with us any longer.

07:18.488 --> 07:19.688
He isn't?

07:19.690 --> 07:21.523
- He's going to be staying with Rita.
- Yes.

07:21.525 --> 07:22.691
Just until I get my foster license.

07:22.743 --> 07:24.326
Why?

07:24.361 --> 07:25.410
Uh, our license is expired,

07:25.445 --> 07:27.329
and with Callie's adoption coming up soon,

07:27.364 --> 07:29.798
you know, we're not going
to take the courses to renew.

07:29.833 --> 07:31.700
We just have a lot on our plates right now.

07:31.702 --> 07:34.669
Yeah, and I'm happy to host A.J.
at my place for a couple of weeks.

07:34.705 --> 07:36.371
When are you leaving?

07:36.423 --> 07:38.573
Oh, Rita has just gotta get
a quick home-study from CPS.

07:38.609 --> 07:40.742
- So, probably a day or two.
- Yeah.

07:40.777 --> 07:43.578
Well, we'll be sorry to see you go.

07:43.614 --> 07:45.046
We really will.

07:45.048 --> 07:47.382
At least there'll be one less person
in the bathroom in the morning, right?

07:47.417 --> 07:49.384
You said it.

07:49.386 --> 07:50.802
That's positive thinking.

07:53.390 --> 07:57.359
Well, I was gonna wait for
Jude to get back from Connor's

07:57.394 --> 07:58.493
to make my big announcement,

07:58.528 --> 08:01.279
but it seems like we
kinda need some good news.

08:01.315 --> 08:02.480
So...

08:02.532 --> 08:04.399
Ana asked me to be Isabella's godmother.

08:04.451 --> 08:07.535
- Oh, honey!
- Well, that's really great, love.

08:07.571 --> 08:09.571
- That's a great honor.
- It sure is.

08:09.573 --> 08:13.341
And Isabella's not the only
one that's gonna get baptized.

08:14.645 --> 08:16.194
- Meaning?
- I am, too.

08:18.498 --> 08:19.547
In the Catholic church?

08:21.151 --> 08:23.184
- Yeah.
- No.

08:25.172 --> 08:26.221
What do you mean, no?

08:29.976 --> 08:30.992
I mean no.

08:42.048 --> 08:44.131
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah. I
know what you're thinking,

08:44.133 --> 08:46.934
but this is not Brandon all over again.

08:46.970 --> 08:50.204
Okay, this thing with A.J...
yeah, it shouldn't have happened,

08:50.240 --> 08:51.939
but it's not like I'm in love with him.

08:54.744 --> 08:55.743
Okay.

08:57.747 --> 08:59.647
Listen...

08:59.682 --> 09:01.866
I've been doing really,
really good on my food plan.

09:03.586 --> 09:06.554
Really. I've been, like,
dieting and exercising and...

09:06.589 --> 09:08.623
Um, I lost a little bit of weight.
Thanks so much for noticing.

09:09.659 --> 09:10.708
Okay?

09:10.743 --> 09:12.593
Uh, last week,

09:12.595 --> 09:13.661
I ate a cake.

09:13.696 --> 09:15.663
Not a piece of cake.

09:15.698 --> 09:18.215
An entire cake.

09:18.251 --> 09:20.468
Right? And I didn't even really enjoy it.

09:20.486 --> 09:23.487
And I felt so bad about myself. I'm
like, "Rita, why did you do that?"

09:23.539 --> 09:26.057
"Why did you eat the whole
cake?" Then I realized.

09:26.092 --> 09:28.075
It was a habit.

09:28.111 --> 09:29.410
I did it because it's a habit.

09:29.445 --> 09:30.995
And habits...

09:31.047 --> 09:33.264
they are really hard to break. Right?

09:35.151 --> 09:36.984
You gotta be smart, Callie.

09:36.986 --> 09:39.120
You can't go through life just
repeating the same mistakes.

09:42.942 --> 09:44.859
I won't. I promise.

09:44.911 --> 09:46.060
- Promise?
- Promise.

09:46.095 --> 09:47.011
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

09:47.046 --> 09:47.962
Okay.

09:56.556 --> 09:57.505
Hey.

09:58.675 --> 09:59.824
Hey, um...

09:59.859 --> 10:02.510
I'm sorry... about all this.

10:02.545 --> 10:04.578
I mean, it's not fair.

10:05.782 --> 10:08.449
It's not all bad. Maybe
if I'm at Rita's, we can...

10:08.451 --> 10:10.484
No, we can't.

10:10.553 --> 10:11.636
Um...

10:11.671 --> 10:13.554
I have a lot going on right now.

10:13.589 --> 10:16.490
And I really... I just
need to focus on myself.

10:16.526 --> 10:19.226
Okay. Yeah.

10:21.230 --> 10:22.296
I get it.

10:35.011 --> 10:37.194
I just... I don't get the big deal.

10:37.230 --> 10:38.879
Didn't you baptize Brandon?

10:40.917 --> 10:41.882
Yes...

10:41.884 --> 10:43.884
But that was more for my father.

10:43.936 --> 10:46.120
Well, why can't I do
this for Ana and Victor?

10:46.155 --> 10:47.922
Victor's just worried that...

10:47.957 --> 10:49.824
If I don't, he won't see me in heaven.

10:49.859 --> 10:52.526
- Oh, my God.
- Honey, that is just ridiculous.

10:52.528 --> 10:53.744
Not to him.

10:53.796 --> 10:56.497
And don't you think it's
a good insurance policy?

10:56.499 --> 10:57.565
I mean, just in case.

10:57.600 --> 11:00.568
We don't believe in
heaven and hell, Mariana.

11:00.603 --> 11:01.952
Well, then what do we believe in?

11:02.005 --> 11:04.572
It's not like we ever go to
church. Do we even believe in God?

11:06.526 --> 11:07.575
Well...

11:07.610 --> 11:09.410
We believe in love.

11:10.480 --> 11:14.415
And in a higher power that
lives within all things.

11:14.450 --> 11:16.283
One that inspires us

11:16.285 --> 11:19.020
to be kind and compassionate to each other.

11:19.055 --> 11:21.956
What we don't believe in, is
an angry old man up in the sky,

11:21.991 --> 11:24.091
threatening to send us to
hell, if we don't do as he says.

11:24.127 --> 11:27.261
I don't like the Gutierrezes scaring you.

11:27.296 --> 11:28.896
I'm not scared.

11:28.931 --> 11:33.067
And look, I know the Catholic church
isn't, like, pro-choice or whatever,

11:33.102 --> 11:34.835
and it doesn't support gay marriage.

11:34.871 --> 11:36.237
Or the use of contraception.

11:36.272 --> 11:39.040
But I don't have to believe in
any of that. I'm not converting.

11:40.710 --> 11:43.661
I just... I want to be
Isabella's godmother,

11:43.696 --> 11:44.945
and I can't if I don't get baptized.

11:51.738 --> 11:53.504
- Hey!
- Hi.

11:54.590 --> 11:55.756
So, you sorry to see him go?

11:58.478 --> 11:59.794
I know you aren't.

11:59.829 --> 12:02.630
I mean, are you buying the reasons
Moms say he has to go to Rita's?

12:02.665 --> 12:05.232
Why? Aren't you?

12:05.268 --> 12:06.500
Yeah, I mean, I guess so.

12:09.205 --> 12:10.504
So, how's Idyllwild?

12:10.506 --> 12:13.074
Uh, good. Well, I think.

12:13.109 --> 12:14.275
I'm trying something kind of...

12:15.311 --> 12:17.962
Weird for my new piece.

12:18.014 --> 12:20.314
Um, and I have to play a
part of it in class this week,

12:20.349 --> 12:22.783
and I'm just thinking
it might be too risky.

12:22.835 --> 12:24.418
So...

12:24.470 --> 12:27.688
If you're asking my advice, I don't
know the black keys from the white ones,

12:27.740 --> 12:29.924
but isn't there someone at
Idyllwild that you trust?

12:29.959 --> 12:31.926
Yeah...

12:31.961 --> 12:33.694
I guess.

12:33.729 --> 12:34.728
There you go.

13:07.330 --> 13:10.347
So, what'd you think?
Am I... crazy? Be honest.

13:10.383 --> 13:12.316
Prepared piano...

13:12.368 --> 13:14.268
- It's bold.
- Too bold?

13:14.303 --> 13:16.036
There's no such thing.

13:16.038 --> 13:17.805
Is it risky? Hell, yeah.

13:17.857 --> 13:19.940
But that doesn't mean
you shouldn't play it.

13:19.976 --> 13:22.943
Okay, but put yourself in my shoes here.

13:22.945 --> 13:25.045
I'm not exactly in a position

13:25.047 --> 13:26.931
to take risks, you know.

13:26.966 --> 13:30.684
Not after they just barely
let me back into the program.

13:30.720 --> 13:31.669
I'm for it.

13:31.721 --> 13:32.987
I've never heard anything
like it played here.

13:34.857 --> 13:36.657
But of course, I don't have a vote.

13:39.879 --> 13:41.829
What would you do?

13:41.864 --> 13:43.797
I still have time to convert it, you know,

13:43.833 --> 13:46.333
back to a traditional piece.

13:46.335 --> 13:48.402
Ah! You know I can't make
that decision for you, dude.

13:50.489 --> 13:53.140
Look, you just gotta go with this.

13:53.176 --> 13:54.208
You gotta go with your gut.

13:54.243 --> 13:55.476
Right, yeah.

13:55.511 --> 13:57.077
Go with my gut.

13:58.080 --> 13:59.964
And what's your gut saying
when you want to throw up?

14:02.351 --> 14:06.053
Wait. So, your moms don't want
you to be the godmother anymore?

14:06.088 --> 14:07.087
Why not?

14:08.424 --> 14:11.976
I don't know. I think it just
kinda caught them off-guard.

14:12.028 --> 14:13.944
- They'll come around.
- I hope so.

14:13.996 --> 14:17.031
Abuelo Victor's been talking about
it all morning. He's so excited.

14:18.167 --> 14:20.067
Stop monitoring my every move!

14:20.102 --> 14:21.936
Just tell me why you need a refill.

14:21.938 --> 14:23.854
Those pills should've
lasted you another week.

14:23.906 --> 14:25.756
Because I ran out, okay?

14:25.791 --> 14:27.041
I lost them and I needed some more.

14:27.043 --> 14:28.809
It's none of your business anyway!

14:28.844 --> 14:31.779
It is my business, Ana, if you
are abusing your pain medication.

14:31.814 --> 14:34.515
Well, I'm not! So, stop
scrutinizing every single thing I do.

14:34.550 --> 14:36.433
I just need some air.

14:36.485 --> 14:37.484
Ana?

14:43.392 --> 14:45.359
Back to work, mijas. Andale.

14:47.463 --> 14:48.462
I'll be in the back.

14:55.288 --> 14:57.238
Hey. What are you...

14:57.273 --> 14:58.372
We would like to have a conversation

14:58.374 --> 15:00.140
with the Gutierrezes, if that's all right?

15:05.711 --> 15:09.238
Our church provides us
with a sense of community

15:09.259 --> 15:11.092
and a sense of purpose.

15:11.127 --> 15:13.194
We just wanted to share that with Mariana.

15:13.230 --> 15:14.262
Is that so bad?

15:14.297 --> 15:16.030
You told our daughter
that she's going to hell.

15:16.066 --> 15:17.265
- I never said that.
- Really?

15:17.317 --> 15:20.001
Okay, but if you're afraid

15:20.036 --> 15:21.202
that you won't meet her in heaven,

15:21.204 --> 15:23.071
what other option is there, Victor?

15:23.106 --> 15:25.807
If Mariana isn't baptized before she dies,

15:25.842 --> 15:27.742
her soul will be in limbo.

15:27.777 --> 15:29.911
And we don't want her to
suffer, waiting for purification,

15:29.963 --> 15:31.713
before she joins God in heaven.

15:32.849 --> 15:34.732
- We didn't mean to overstep.
- Mmm.

15:36.720 --> 15:40.755
Hey, um... my moms just want
to talk about the baptism.

15:42.442 --> 15:44.290
We wouldn't be in this position
if Ana had had her children

15:44.291 --> 15:45.291
baptized in the first place.

15:47.681 --> 15:49.464
It's something I really regret.

15:49.499 --> 15:52.534
We hear you, and we understand, Ana...

15:52.569 --> 15:54.385
but here's the thing.

15:54.437 --> 15:57.605
Jesus and Mariana are not your children.

15:57.641 --> 15:59.240
Or your grandchildren.

15:59.242 --> 16:01.409
You have a relationship with
Mariana because we allow it.

16:01.444 --> 16:03.511
It's not your place to parent her.

16:09.119 --> 16:11.119
They're right. They're her parents.

16:12.305 --> 16:15.356
I'm sorry. I should've asked
permission before any of this.

16:15.478 --> 16:17.195
Yes. Yes, you should have.

16:17.230 --> 16:20.298
Fine. You're right. Absolutely.

16:21.968 --> 16:24.018
But let me ask you something.

16:24.070 --> 16:25.236
You don't go to church, right?

16:27.040 --> 16:28.072
No, we don't.

16:28.204 --> 16:30.171
So, do you not believe in God?

16:30.223 --> 16:32.974
That's a fairly personal question, Elena.

16:33.026 --> 16:35.226
Okay. Then, tell me this.

16:35.261 --> 16:37.995
Is there any reason you don't want
your children to believe in God?

16:43.069 --> 16:44.102
Ty. Mike.

16:44.154 --> 16:45.737
Nice to finally meet you.

16:45.772 --> 16:46.754
Hey!

16:48.708 --> 16:49.807
Can I get you something to drink?

16:49.843 --> 16:51.476
- Water's cool.
- Okay.

17:00.804 --> 17:01.853
So, he's a cop?

17:03.523 --> 17:04.539
Ty, be cool.

17:11.314 --> 17:12.480
So...

17:12.515 --> 17:15.583
A lonely white cop wants
to foster a black teen.

17:15.617 --> 17:17.401
Oh, I've seen this movie before.

17:17.436 --> 17:20.505
Let me guess. You're gonna save
my brother from being dangerous,

17:20.507 --> 17:22.272
violent, and criminally inclined, right?

17:23.409 --> 17:25.175
Um...

17:25.211 --> 17:27.178
I'm not interested in saving anybody.

17:27.213 --> 17:29.213
I'm fostering A.J., so I
can provide him with a home.

17:29.215 --> 17:30.815
Until he ages out.

17:30.817 --> 17:31.859
He's almost 18. What?

17:31.860 --> 17:33.060
You need a few months of
government checks that bad?

17:33.086 --> 17:34.118
Ty!

17:34.154 --> 17:35.253
It's okay.

17:35.305 --> 17:39.257
Look, I'm not just in
this till he turns 18.

17:39.292 --> 17:40.992
I'm not gonna just throw him out!

17:41.027 --> 17:43.161
I want him to go to
college, get an education.

17:43.196 --> 17:44.846
I'm gonna support him any way I can.

17:46.232 --> 17:49.133
Look, I'm not in this for just
a few months. This is forever.

17:51.738 --> 17:54.639
Foster kids have no control

17:54.674 --> 17:56.691
over where they live,

17:56.743 --> 17:57.992
who they live with.

17:58.027 --> 18:00.745
So, this app, "Fost and Found,"

18:00.780 --> 18:03.407
will give them the access
and information they need,

18:03.408 --> 18:04.708
so they can have some power,

18:04.984 --> 18:07.618
so they can make decisions for themselves.

18:07.654 --> 18:09.587
Why can't they just look those
things up on the Internet?

18:09.639 --> 18:11.472
Well, most foster kids

18:11.524 --> 18:12.690
don't know what they need.

18:12.725 --> 18:15.359
So, they don't know what to search for.

18:15.361 --> 18:16.744
So, this web app will help direct them.

18:16.779 --> 18:19.380
You know, like two
organizations that provide

18:19.432 --> 18:21.299
donated prom dresses or...

18:21.351 --> 18:23.568
two dental clinics that
provide free teeth cleanings.

18:24.704 --> 18:27.638
There's even a summer camp
for foster kids that's free.

18:27.674 --> 18:30.408
But most of us don't even
know these things exist.

18:30.443 --> 18:31.509
I know I didn't.

18:33.246 --> 18:35.079
That's all great stuff,

18:35.114 --> 18:36.247
no doubt about it,

18:36.299 --> 18:39.183
but your old independent
study at the drop-in center

18:39.219 --> 18:41.068
was so interactive.

18:41.104 --> 18:44.839
You got such terrific
face-to-face time with the kids.

18:44.874 --> 18:49.060
This just seems so much less...

18:49.095 --> 18:50.027
immersive.

18:54.968 --> 18:57.050
So, how much longer were you
at that other foster house

18:57.051 --> 18:57.901
before you moved in here?

18:57.937 --> 18:59.915
I'm actually moving out of that house

18:59.916 --> 19:01.016
and into a different
one for a little while.

19:01.074 --> 19:03.674
Mike still hasn't gotten
his foster license.

19:03.710 --> 19:05.643
Say what now? Why are
you moving around so much?

19:07.780 --> 19:10.615
I kissed my foster sister.

19:10.617 --> 19:12.917
Hold up. That Callie girl?

19:12.952 --> 19:14.719
- Why doesn't she have to move out?
- Because...

19:14.771 --> 19:16.771
Because the black kid kissed the
white girl, and that's a big no.

19:16.823 --> 19:18.823
That's not how it is, Ty.
One of her moms is black.

19:18.825 --> 19:21.475
Whatever. They're moving your ass out
because they're gettin' rid of you.

19:21.511 --> 19:24.528
- They don't want you to have anything to do with that girl.
- No, man. It's not like that.

19:24.564 --> 19:26.280
Listen to me, A.J...

19:26.332 --> 19:28.332
This Mike is not your forever father.

19:28.384 --> 19:29.667
They are getting rid of you.

19:29.702 --> 19:31.502
As sure as I'm sitting here,

19:31.537 --> 19:32.603
as soon as you wake up

19:32.639 --> 19:34.405
and realize that, you give me a call.

19:36.276 --> 19:37.508
Hey! You guys hungry? Grub's up.

20:06.139 --> 20:07.722
Great work, Brandon.

20:07.774 --> 20:09.690
Really nice. Glad to have you back.

20:09.742 --> 20:11.943
That's all we have time for. We'll
hear from the rest of you tomorrow.

20:11.995 --> 20:13.761
Dude, that was sweet.

20:13.796 --> 20:15.012
Really tight.

20:15.048 --> 20:16.764
Thanks for, you know, the advice.

20:16.816 --> 20:18.683
No, all I said was to follow your gut.

20:18.735 --> 20:19.784
You can't go wrong with that.

20:23.506 --> 20:25.489
Hey! So...

20:25.525 --> 20:26.724
I liked your piece.

20:26.776 --> 20:29.694
I really did, but I feel like
you're holding back, Brandon.

20:30.797 --> 20:32.797
You've got to be more imaginative,

20:32.799 --> 20:34.532
braver, and bolder.

20:34.567 --> 20:37.535
This is the time to take chances.

20:37.570 --> 20:41.455
You're not going to get anywhere...
definitely not Disney hall...

20:41.507 --> 20:42.606
by playing it safe.

20:56.055 --> 20:58.372
So, CPS did the home
visit, so we're good to go.

20:58.408 --> 21:00.291
- Great!
- I thought, maybe,

21:00.293 --> 21:03.361
we could go over some house rules
before we move you in tomorrow?

21:03.396 --> 21:04.996
Okay.

21:05.031 --> 21:07.031
So, I saw you and Brandon

21:07.083 --> 21:09.216
get into it at Callie's party.

21:09.252 --> 21:11.152
And Mike told me...

21:11.187 --> 21:14.872
that you're talking to your brother and
that's fine, but there will be no lying.

21:14.907 --> 21:15.956
Understood?

21:16.009 --> 21:17.742
- Yes, ma'am.
- Okay.

21:17.777 --> 21:21.746
I also know that you're the reason that
Callie got fired from the drop-in center.

21:21.781 --> 21:24.615
What? What do you mean, Callie got fired?

21:24.650 --> 21:25.966
What happened?

21:26.002 --> 21:28.019
It was before I even met you.

21:28.054 --> 21:29.687
It's kinda how I ended up in detention.

21:29.722 --> 21:30.654
What did you do?

21:32.658 --> 21:34.492
She let me spend the night there,

21:34.544 --> 21:35.593
and I took off.

21:35.628 --> 21:36.727
Stole some spray paint.

21:36.763 --> 21:37.862
I see.

21:37.897 --> 21:41.282
She didn't want Stef and
Lena to find out, so...

21:41.334 --> 21:42.666
Okay.

21:42.668 --> 21:45.269
Listen, didn't mean to narc on you there.

21:45.304 --> 21:46.303
Okay?

21:46.339 --> 21:47.505
But the point is,

21:47.540 --> 21:49.273
there are no second chances with me.

21:49.308 --> 21:51.308
There'll be no lying,

21:51.344 --> 21:52.410
no stealing,

21:52.445 --> 21:54.445
no running away, no fighting.

21:54.480 --> 21:55.479
One strike and you're out.

21:57.250 --> 21:58.282
You got it?

21:59.385 --> 22:01.135
Got it.

22:01.267 --> 22:04.435
I can't believe she had the nerve to ask us

22:04.504 --> 22:06.270
if we didn't want our
kids to believe in God.

22:06.305 --> 22:07.371
What the hell was that?

22:07.406 --> 22:09.240
And what the hell business is it of theirs?

22:09.242 --> 22:12.359
I agree with you, love. I
totally, absolutely agree with you.

22:12.395 --> 22:15.079
But you know, we haven't exactly
exposed our kids to anything.

22:15.114 --> 22:17.982
We don't go to church. We don't pray.

22:18.017 --> 22:19.917
I mean, is it our fault
that Mariana went running

22:19.969 --> 22:21.852
to the first person that
talked to her about God?

22:21.854 --> 22:26.056
No, no, no, no. This was not an invitation
to learn more about the Catholic church.

22:26.092 --> 22:30.027
This was... this was an
ultimatum. This was blackmail.

22:30.062 --> 22:32.980
Victor literally said, you cannot
be godmother if you're not baptized.

22:34.000 --> 22:34.949
What is that?

22:35.001 --> 22:37.034
It's their beliefs.

22:37.069 --> 22:38.586
Well...

22:38.638 --> 22:41.572
It's not their place to impose
their beliefs on our daughter.

22:41.607 --> 22:42.573
I agree.

22:43.659 --> 22:45.609
But, you know, we've always said

22:45.611 --> 22:48.546
that we would allow our children
to choose their own spiritual paths.

22:49.849 --> 22:52.449
I don't know. When does
that... when does that start?

22:56.355 --> 22:58.422
I should've told you about the
drop-in center and everything.

23:01.260 --> 23:02.326
Trying to protect Callie?

23:03.529 --> 23:04.495
I know.

23:05.531 --> 23:07.348
Look...

23:07.400 --> 23:09.400
Are you interested in her?

23:09.435 --> 23:11.118
Like, romantically?

23:12.505 --> 23:14.471
Relax, it's not a trick question.

23:16.142 --> 23:17.157
I honestly want to know.

23:19.045 --> 23:20.995
Yeah, I guess.

23:22.181 --> 23:24.315
I mean, I'm not sure
she's interested in me,

23:24.350 --> 23:26.317
but if she was, would that be a problem?

23:26.352 --> 23:28.252
I mean, it's okay if I'm
living with you and Rita, right?

23:30.289 --> 23:32.940
Look, I think Callie's a great girl...

23:33.025 --> 23:34.191
Honest.

23:34.193 --> 23:36.860
I just don't think...

23:36.896 --> 23:39.063
getting involved with her is a great idea.

23:39.098 --> 23:41.649
How come?

23:41.701 --> 23:44.752
She just has a lot of
stuff to work out. And...

23:44.787 --> 23:46.720
she comes with more than
her fair share of drama.

23:47.857 --> 23:49.773
There's just a lot of other
girls out there, A.J...

23:49.809 --> 23:51.642
I just think you might be better off.

23:51.677 --> 23:52.660
That's all.

24:00.653 --> 24:02.253
Good night.

24:40.574 --> 24:41.907
Sorry I'm late.

24:41.909 --> 24:43.809
She's been fussy all morning.

24:43.844 --> 24:44.843
Here, let me.

24:51.619 --> 24:53.519
So, have you talked to Father Pena yet?

24:53.554 --> 24:55.387
Uh, no, not yet.

24:56.557 --> 24:58.290
Where are your moms?

24:58.325 --> 25:00.576
Um, they're not coming.

25:04.032 --> 25:05.748
So, are you okay?

25:05.783 --> 25:08.751
I heard you and Elena
fighting yesterday, and...

25:08.803 --> 25:12.688
And you want to know if
I'm abusing my pain killers.

25:12.740 --> 25:14.790
I flushed them, the whole bottle.

25:14.826 --> 25:16.909
I've been trying to live with the pain,

25:16.961 --> 25:20.680
but I finally realized I can't.

25:20.682 --> 25:22.648
So, I got a refill.

25:22.684 --> 25:24.717
Why didn't you tell your mom that?

25:24.752 --> 25:27.503
Because my parents only
see me as an addict.

25:27.538 --> 25:30.639
If they had the slightest
idea that I was worried

25:30.692 --> 25:33.359
about relapsing,

25:33.411 --> 25:34.527
they'd be all over me.

25:36.464 --> 25:37.463
So, you're cool?

25:38.766 --> 25:40.349
I promise.

25:41.652 --> 25:42.651
I...

25:43.688 --> 25:46.372
I'm sorry this has caused so much trouble,

25:46.424 --> 25:48.290
but I want you to know

25:48.342 --> 25:49.442
how much it means to me,

25:49.477 --> 25:51.510
not getting you and Jesus baptized

25:51.562 --> 25:55.114
was just another reminder of the
million ways I was a terrible mother.

25:56.217 --> 25:57.333
Look who's here.

26:01.189 --> 26:02.354
You came.

26:02.356 --> 26:04.156
Of course we came.

26:04.192 --> 26:06.292
And we come bearing gifts.

26:06.344 --> 26:09.261
One of those in there is for you,
and the other is for Isabella,

26:09.313 --> 26:13.032
to commemorate your
godmother-goddaughter bond.

26:13.034 --> 26:15.050
So pretty. Thank you.

26:15.086 --> 26:17.169
Mariana, are we ready?

26:17.221 --> 26:18.170
Um, yes.

26:18.222 --> 26:20.022
Father Pena, these are my moms.

26:20.074 --> 26:21.791
Lovely to meet you.

26:21.826 --> 26:23.743
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

26:23.745 --> 26:24.877
Pleasure.

26:24.912 --> 26:25.911
Shall we?

26:28.683 --> 26:30.065
Now, I know you weren't
raised in the church,

26:30.101 --> 26:34.620
but I'm happy to see that your
reunion with your grandparents is...

26:34.655 --> 26:36.722
My birth grandparents.

26:36.758 --> 26:37.923
Oh, uh...

26:37.959 --> 26:40.409
Of course. Um...

26:40.461 --> 26:43.863
I'm happy to see that your reunion
with your birth grandparents

26:43.898 --> 26:47.399
has ignited an interest
in a spiritual connection.

26:47.401 --> 26:50.619
Normally, before we do this,
there's quite a bit of instruction,

26:50.655 --> 26:54.640
but these are obviously
very special circumstances.

26:54.675 --> 26:58.377
So, then I'll bring you up and
introduce you as Mariana Gutierrez...

26:58.412 --> 27:00.312
No, no, no. "Adams Foster."

27:01.549 --> 27:03.382
Right. I'm sorry. I knew that.

27:04.469 --> 27:06.519
I'm just getting everything
wrong today, aren't I?

27:06.554 --> 27:08.254
It's fine.

27:08.289 --> 27:11.257
So, then, at the altar,
you'll repeat after me,

27:11.292 --> 27:13.459
and recite the following oath

27:13.494 --> 27:16.328
before your congregation and God.

27:16.364 --> 27:20.366
"I believe and profess all
that the holy Catholic church

27:20.401 --> 27:23.836
believes, teaches, and proclaims,

27:23.871 --> 27:25.921
to be revealed by God."

27:27.275 --> 27:28.908
Is it a sin

27:28.943 --> 27:31.076
to say the oath and not believe it?

27:31.112 --> 27:32.995
Well, it is a sin to lie,

27:33.030 --> 27:34.847
but what don't you believe?

27:36.934 --> 27:39.018
Well, you met my moms.

27:39.053 --> 27:41.537
They're married. Would
the church accept them?

27:41.572 --> 27:44.490
Of course. We welcome all sinners.

27:56.437 --> 27:58.270
Rita told Mike I got you fired.

27:59.740 --> 28:01.540
And then, he told me

28:01.576 --> 28:03.275
that I'm supposed to stay away from you.

28:04.445 --> 28:06.345
He said what?

28:06.397 --> 28:08.480
And then, I realized that's
why I'm going to Rita's.

28:09.500 --> 28:11.166
I crossed the line.

28:11.202 --> 28:13.118
I kissed the princess, and
now, they want to keep me

28:13.154 --> 28:14.470
as far away from you as they can.

28:14.522 --> 28:17.156
Why would you say that? What did he say?

28:17.191 --> 28:19.258
He said that you had a
lot of stuff to work out

28:19.293 --> 28:21.043
and that I should keep my distance.

28:22.430 --> 28:23.996
What, you think that's about you?

28:25.266 --> 28:27.166
No, he's looking out for you, not me.

28:29.337 --> 28:31.003
When I first got here...

28:33.107 --> 28:35.741
Brandon and I, kind
of, fell for each other.

28:37.044 --> 28:38.143
That's why that guy hates my guts.

28:39.780 --> 28:41.847
We fell in love...

28:41.883 --> 28:43.983
but I needed a family, so we ended it.

28:44.018 --> 28:45.951
I ended it.

28:45.953 --> 28:48.971
That's probably why
Mike said that. He was...

28:49.023 --> 28:50.723
he probably doesn't want you to get hurt.

28:50.758 --> 28:53.726
I'm not worried about getting
my feelings hurt, Callie.

28:53.761 --> 28:56.462
Besides, there's one big
difference between me and Brandon.

28:58.649 --> 28:59.765
I'm never gonna be your brother.

29:04.320 --> 29:05.700
_

29:05.773 --> 29:07.273
Damn it, I'm gonna get a ticket!

29:41.142 --> 29:42.107
What's this?

29:42.109 --> 29:44.243
It's a gift for Bella from my moms.

29:48.049 --> 29:49.298
But...

29:49.350 --> 29:51.016
I have to tell you something.

29:55.609 --> 29:57.119
What? When did this happen?

29:57.130 --> 29:58.346
Just got it. My moms don't know yet.

30:07.391 --> 30:09.891
I hate parallel parking.

30:09.926 --> 30:12.193
What's the hurry? Let's take it for a spin.

30:12.195 --> 30:14.879
Well, I can't drive until I get insurance.

30:14.915 --> 30:16.164
Come on, let's take it
around the block one time.

30:16.216 --> 30:17.899
I'm sure we'll find a better parking spot.

30:19.236 --> 30:21.019
Come on, girl! Let me see your skills.

30:26.843 --> 30:27.976
So, you guys are really okay with this?

30:29.813 --> 30:31.780
It's Mariana's choice, not ours.

30:33.900 --> 30:36.718
Hey, sweetheart, the service is
about to start. What are you doing?

30:40.640 --> 30:42.474
I'm not...

30:42.509 --> 30:43.591
I'm not gonna get baptized.

30:44.661 --> 30:45.860
Well, why not, love?

30:47.547 --> 30:48.913
Because...

30:48.965 --> 30:51.499
I'm not gonna stand up there and
say that I believe in a church

30:51.501 --> 30:53.518
that thinks my moms are
sinners just for being gay.

30:55.489 --> 30:57.739
I mean, am I a sinner because I'm straight?

30:57.774 --> 30:59.441
No.

30:59.476 --> 31:00.508
No, I'm not.

31:01.712 --> 31:03.545
So, you're not gonna
be Isabella's godmother?

31:06.233 --> 31:07.482
It's okay.

31:07.517 --> 31:10.318
I'll just keep looking
out for her like I do.

31:10.354 --> 31:11.503
I don't need a title for that.

31:15.475 --> 31:17.442
Hey! Have you seen Ana?

31:17.477 --> 31:19.194
What? What do you mean?

31:19.246 --> 31:20.462
She said she was going to the restroom,

31:20.497 --> 31:22.297
but I think she left.

31:22.332 --> 31:23.331
I can't find her anywhere.

31:31.208 --> 31:33.241
Good morning, everyone.

31:33.243 --> 31:36.211
Okay. Who's up first?

31:36.246 --> 31:38.263
- We'd like to go first, if that's okay?
- It's all yours.

32:10.931 --> 32:12.730
Could you drive any slower?

32:12.783 --> 32:14.616
I can't afford to get a ticket.

32:14.651 --> 32:18.453
You know you can get a ticket for
driving under the speed limit, right?

32:18.488 --> 32:19.587
No way. Really?

32:22.592 --> 32:24.726
So, you and Brandon...

32:24.761 --> 32:26.744
That's over, right?

32:26.780 --> 32:28.530
Like, you don't have a
thing for him anymore?

32:29.666 --> 32:30.665
Right.

32:33.270 --> 32:35.437
So, you gonna drive this thing
over to Rita's and visit me?

32:35.439 --> 32:36.604
Maybe, if you're nice.

32:38.442 --> 32:39.524
I'm always nice.

32:43.463 --> 32:46.514
No, no, no, no, no. Oh, my God.

32:47.584 --> 32:49.484
We've looked everywhere.

32:49.486 --> 32:51.419
She's not answering her phone either.

32:51.455 --> 32:52.487
I think she's using again.

32:54.141 --> 32:55.423
Is that her?

32:55.425 --> 32:57.425
No. I'm so sorry, I have to take this.

32:58.778 --> 33:01.913
No, she's not using again. I
literally just talked to her about it.

33:01.965 --> 33:04.098
Well, if it isn't her pain
pills, then it's something else.

33:04.134 --> 33:06.134
We've been down this road before with Ana.

33:07.270 --> 33:09.270
Well, we just have to do
this without her, come on.

33:09.322 --> 33:11.239
Do what? Baptize Isabella?

33:11.274 --> 33:12.907
No, you can't!

33:12.943 --> 33:14.792
This is a family matter, Mariana.

33:14.845 --> 33:17.011
You've made it quite clear you
don't want to be a part of ours.

33:21.952 --> 33:24.118
- Sweetheart...
- Ana hates me.

33:24.120 --> 33:25.787
That is not what's happening here.

33:25.805 --> 33:27.889
You're not responsible for any of this.

33:27.941 --> 33:29.891
Okay. Yeah. I will be right there.

33:29.943 --> 33:30.959
What? What is it? What happened?

33:30.994 --> 33:32.694
Callie and A.J. have been arrested...

33:32.696 --> 33:33.995
What?

33:33.997 --> 33:35.513
For stealing a car.

33:38.768 --> 33:39.851
It's a fake.

33:39.886 --> 33:42.437
But it's pink. It's
called a pink slip, right?

33:42.489 --> 33:44.252
We didn't exactly know

33:44.253 --> 33:45.253
what a title looks like.

33:45.458 --> 33:47.509
No, of course you didn't. How
could you? You're teenagers.

33:48.512 --> 33:49.944
I cannot believe you bought a stolen car.

33:49.980 --> 33:54.449
This is why you don't do things like
this without talking to your parents.

33:54.451 --> 33:56.334
Well, we were gonna tell you.

33:56.369 --> 33:58.286
We just wanted to wait to have
enough money for insurance.

34:02.359 --> 34:04.209
Are you really looking
at your phone right now?

34:05.545 --> 34:07.161
Sorry, I just...

34:07.214 --> 34:09.496
it's Adriana. Ana showed up
to the reception. She's okay.

34:11.268 --> 34:13.368
But do you think we're gonna
get any of the money back?

34:13.402 --> 34:14.435
I mean, they took the car.

34:21.061 --> 34:22.260
Super bold piece, man.

34:22.312 --> 34:24.344
I'm so glad everyone loved your idea.

34:25.364 --> 34:26.947
Look, man. Sure...

34:27.000 --> 34:28.166
I was inspired by what you played,

34:28.201 --> 34:30.034
but prepared piano has been around forever.

34:30.085 --> 34:31.202
It's not like you invented it.

34:31.254 --> 34:33.271
That is such bull. You know it.

34:33.306 --> 34:35.889
You never would've thought
of that if it wasn't for me.

34:35.942 --> 34:36.991
Are you buying this?

34:37.027 --> 34:38.293
I'm Switzerland, all right?

34:38.328 --> 34:40.895
Yeah, well, you know what
the Swiss did in World War II?

34:40.931 --> 34:42.163
Nothing. They just stood by and watched.

34:42.165 --> 34:44.047
I mean, is that really
who you wanna be, Jin?

34:44.100 --> 34:45.833
Oh, chill out, Brandon.

34:45.869 --> 34:47.869
Look, there were no war crimes committed.

34:47.904 --> 34:51.005
Everyone went home last night, and made
adjustments based on Chris' critiques.

34:51.041 --> 34:52.940
I was in a position to
nad up and take a chance.

34:52.976 --> 34:54.609
I'm not gonna apologize for that.

34:54.643 --> 34:56.811
Man, that is so weak,
it's actually pathetic.

34:56.813 --> 34:58.813
Look who decided to grow a pair.

34:58.815 --> 35:00.815
It's not my fault you
don't believe in yourself.

35:02.752 --> 35:05.753
Is that why you brought me back? Because
you don't think I'm a real threat?

35:05.789 --> 35:07.456
Well, huge mistake, okay?

35:07.457 --> 35:09.357
You might've gotten away
with stealing my idea,

35:09.576 --> 35:12.694
but we both know that my prepared piece
would've blown yours out of the water.

35:12.729 --> 35:15.713
Okay? And if I ever had a doubt
about the fact that I belong here,

35:15.765 --> 35:17.382
well, it's gone now, okay?

35:17.434 --> 35:19.784
So, prepare for some serious
competition, my friend,

35:19.819 --> 35:21.452
'cause I'm about to own you.

35:23.940 --> 35:25.506
I'll get it.

35:27.344 --> 35:30.178
What do you wanna do for dinner?

35:30.230 --> 35:32.280
Oh, God. I don't know.
Should I run to the store?

35:32.282 --> 35:33.615
I could do it.

35:35.502 --> 35:36.584
Who is it, honey?

35:40.357 --> 35:41.389
Hi, Ana.

35:43.076 --> 35:45.076
I, um...

35:45.111 --> 35:46.361
I think I made a mistake.

35:48.298 --> 35:49.464
I want you to take Isabella.

35:55.006 --> 35:58.957
I know you think that I
left because I was using,

35:58.978 --> 36:00.344
but it's not what happened.

36:00.469 --> 36:03.203
I left because I couldn't...

36:03.239 --> 36:07.041
stand up in front of
all those people and...

36:07.076 --> 36:10.110
Promise to take care of my baby.

36:10.146 --> 36:13.897
I know it's horrible, I do, but I just...

36:13.949 --> 36:15.315
I feel no connection to her.

36:17.002 --> 36:18.168
Look at all these parents,

36:18.204 --> 36:20.838
and they seem so happy.

36:20.873 --> 36:23.223
And that's not the way it is with me.

36:23.259 --> 36:25.092
I just feel...

36:25.127 --> 36:27.061
so empty.

36:27.113 --> 36:29.730
This is the way I felt with you and Jesus.

36:31.150 --> 36:33.867
And I always thought that it was the drugs.

36:33.869 --> 36:35.035
But I guess...

36:37.873 --> 36:39.840
I guess I'm just not meant to be a mother.

36:46.031 --> 36:47.748
I think it...

36:47.783 --> 36:50.050
It sounds like you might be
suffering from postpartum depression.

36:50.086 --> 36:51.885
Oh, is that her latest excuse?

36:51.887 --> 36:54.555
This is a very real thing, Victor.

36:54.557 --> 36:56.640
Women have been known to struggle
with it, sometimes for months,

36:56.692 --> 36:58.525
after having given birth.

36:58.577 --> 37:00.828
- Please!
- Why do you do that?

37:00.830 --> 37:03.831
Why do you always assume the worst of her?

37:03.833 --> 37:06.867
Look, I may not have
been raised in a church,

37:06.902 --> 37:09.837
but my moms have always
taught me to believe in family,

37:09.872 --> 37:11.605
and to believe in people,

37:11.657 --> 37:13.574
and to believe in the best
possible version of people.

37:13.626 --> 37:15.776
And that's what Ana needs right now.

37:15.811 --> 37:17.478
For you to have faith in her.

37:17.513 --> 37:18.796
She needs your love and support.

37:18.848 --> 37:21.381
You don't know what we've
been through with her.

37:21.417 --> 37:22.599
I do.

37:22.651 --> 37:24.651
She stole money from me. She lied to me.

37:26.372 --> 37:28.489
But I still believe in her.

37:28.524 --> 37:31.492
You can't just assume she's using
again, every time she has a bad day.

37:36.649 --> 37:38.565
I guess we have been guilty of that,

37:40.436 --> 37:41.602
but you have to understand...

37:41.654 --> 37:45.339
No excuses. You either
believe in her or you don't.

37:49.410 --> 37:52.427
It's no secret that I've had my
problems with the Catholic church,

37:52.463 --> 37:54.580
but one thing that I think is so beautiful,

37:54.615 --> 37:56.481
that they get really, really right,

37:56.517 --> 37:58.383
is forgiveness.

37:58.402 --> 38:00.519
Absolute forgiveness for
ourselves, for others.

38:02.423 --> 38:04.122
I think we all deserve that.

38:07.511 --> 38:09.261
I hope you know, mija...

38:11.232 --> 38:14.099
we really do want you to succeed.

38:18.038 --> 38:19.955
I just don't want to feel this way anymore.

38:23.177 --> 38:24.343
So, we'll get you some help.

38:35.005 --> 38:36.972
What a day, huh?

38:40.194 --> 38:42.127
Sometimes, I wonder if it's
ever gonna get any easier.

38:45.132 --> 38:46.698
I hate that tree.

38:50.938 --> 38:52.004
What?

38:54.975 --> 38:56.808
I feel horrible saying it, but I hate it.

38:58.412 --> 39:00.979
Every day I come down here and I look
through this window, and I hope...

39:02.116 --> 39:04.666
and I pray that I will just see a tree...

39:08.756 --> 39:10.722
instead of a reminder that I lost my baby.

39:15.729 --> 39:17.646
I know I should've said this in therapy,

39:17.681 --> 39:18.997
but I guess I was afraid.

39:20.768 --> 39:22.601
But after speaking with Ana...

39:23.804 --> 39:25.904
about her postpartum, I think, um...

39:27.958 --> 39:29.708
I think that...

39:31.845 --> 39:33.595
I've been depressed, too...

39:34.965 --> 39:36.932
ever since we lost Frankie.

39:38.819 --> 39:40.602
And I'm not saying that it's...

39:41.772 --> 39:43.789
that it's postpartum. I just...

39:45.659 --> 39:46.825
I'm still not over it.

39:46.877 --> 39:48.827
No, it's not gonna go away,
love. That's not how grief works.

39:48.879 --> 39:50.579
I know you know that.

39:51.732 --> 39:53.598
It's awful, love, and it's...

39:53.634 --> 39:54.800
messy and it sucks,

39:54.802 --> 39:57.519
and it's gonna take as long
as it takes, and you feel it,

39:57.554 --> 39:59.938
and you ride it out, okay?
And I'm gonna be here.

39:59.974 --> 40:02.708
I'm gonna be here every second,

40:02.743 --> 40:03.859
for whatever you need. You hear me?

40:06.697 --> 40:08.613
One day, you're gonna look out that window,

40:08.649 --> 40:10.666
and you're not gonna
feel so sad, I promise.

40:27.434 --> 40:30.602
So, I'm guessing that you've heard about
the whole "stolen car" misunderstanding.

40:30.654 --> 40:33.488
So, please let me get
Callie down here to explain.

40:33.524 --> 40:35.607
Hey, Callie! Can you
come down here, please?

40:36.694 --> 40:38.694
Actually, that's not why I'm here.

40:38.746 --> 40:42.497
I was reviewing Callie's
file for your final home study

40:42.533 --> 40:44.649
to recommend her adoption to the judge,

40:44.685 --> 40:47.502
and I have some concerns
about Callie's foster brother.

40:47.538 --> 40:49.540
Oh, well, A.J. will be moving

40:49.541 --> 40:51.141
- to a new home in a few days.
- Yes.

40:51.709 --> 40:53.759
It's not A.J. I'm worried about.

40:53.794 --> 40:55.594
It's Brandon.

40:56.847 --> 40:59.765
I'm wondering why you felt the need

40:59.800 --> 41:03.468
to take out a restraining
order against your son.

41:03.520 --> 41:06.722
I don't even know how you
got that. That was expunged.

41:06.774 --> 41:08.690
Well, even if it was,

41:08.726 --> 41:11.476
I'm afraid I can't make a
recommendation on her adoption

41:11.528 --> 41:13.545
until I investigate this further.

41:13.580 --> 41:16.565
And while I am,

41:16.617 --> 41:18.817
it's not appropriate for
Callie to be in your care.
