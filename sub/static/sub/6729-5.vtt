01:47.559 --> 01:50.892
Do you think rubber bands
just buy themselves, Miss Jones?

01:50.976 --> 01:52.976
Last week it was
a 20-foot paper clip chain,

01:53.059 --> 01:54.859
and it's been reported
that you've been taking

01:54.892 --> 01:57.601
six-packs of Diet Coke home
from the employee kitchen.

01:57.684 --> 01:59.642
Two. I took two cans.

02:00.475 --> 02:04.350
If you're lucky, they won't fire you.
Just dock your pay again.

02:11.267 --> 02:13.100
It doesn't take a genius to know

02:13.183 --> 02:15.475
that you can't afford that suit
on mid-management salary.

02:15.559 --> 02:17.100
What are you talking about?

02:17.183 --> 02:20.392
Not to mention these weekly trips
to Atlantic City.

02:20.976 --> 02:24.684
Then there's this non-existent employee,
Jane Smith?

02:24.767 --> 02:26.142
You are way out of line.

02:26.225 --> 02:28.434
What doesn't line up
are these missing funds.

02:28.517 --> 02:30.350
What is that word...

02:30.434 --> 02:33.517
Embezzlement? Or is it that other word?
Starts with an "F."

02:33.601 --> 02:36.059
Fa... Fa... Felony?

02:36.183 --> 02:37.225
What do you want?

02:37.309 --> 02:38.934
- Same thing as you.
- For you to quit?

02:39.018 --> 02:42.475
Actually, it's better if you fire me
and give me six months' severance pay.

02:42.559 --> 02:45.726
And a glowing recommendation,
or I email that to HR.

02:45.809 --> 02:48.684
A budding extortionist.

02:48.767 --> 02:51.434
Your parents must be so proud.

02:58.767 --> 03:02.018
Hey, turns out I'm free for happy hour.

03:02.100 --> 03:04.976
Well, it's 5:00 somewhere,
and I need to update my resume.

03:05.059 --> 03:09.434
Would you put day drinking
under "Experience" or "Special Skills"?

03:09.517 --> 03:11.997
- What was it this time?
- He was an asshole.

03:12.059 --> 03:14.726
And the job was "siphoning
your soul through a Xerox machine"?

03:14.809 --> 03:15.892
No, that was my last job.

03:15.976 --> 03:18.851
This job was sucking my brains out
through the air vent.

03:18.934 --> 03:22.142
You're bored because you're overqualified
for all these crappy jobs.

03:22.225 --> 03:25.726
Yet I'm uniquely unqualified
for anything else.

03:25.809 --> 03:28.018
Bullshit. Hey! You're good at bullshit!

03:28.100 --> 03:32.601
Hey, play a game of <i>Love Tester</i> with me?
I think we'd be a match.

03:32.684 --> 03:35.976
Um, while that's an amazing offer,
I'm kind of busy right now.

03:36.059 --> 03:37.142
Hey, I know you.

03:37.225 --> 03:39.892
But you were a redhead.
I watched your show.

03:39.976 --> 03:44.475
<i>♪ It's Patsy! Patsy!</i>
I really wanna be your friend ♪

03:44.559 --> 03:47.517
- It was a long time ago.
- I was 12.

03:47.601 --> 03:49.642
- I learned a lot from Patsy.
- Uh-huh.

03:49.726 --> 03:52.767
Patsy taught me how to
hold a remote with one hand,

03:52.851 --> 03:55.684
and box the bald-headed bishop
with the other.

03:58.475 --> 03:59.475
I'll play you.

04:00.684 --> 04:01.934
Yeah, sure. Why not?

04:02.018 --> 04:03.309
Jess, it's not worth it.

04:03.392 --> 04:04.976
I think it is.

04:05.059 --> 04:09.392
But I'm not really feeling
the <i>Love Tester</i> right now.

04:09.475 --> 04:11.517
How about the <i>Strength Tester</i> instead?

04:12.350 --> 04:14.517
I win, you pick up our bar tab,

04:14.601 --> 04:18.183
apologize to my friend,
and find somewhere else to drink.

04:18.267 --> 04:21.183
And when I win?

04:22.559 --> 04:26.976
I'll take you out back and meet
that bald-headed bishop of yours.

04:27.059 --> 04:30.183
Okay.

04:38.059 --> 04:41.601
<i>- Ladies and gentlemen.</i>
<i>- Welcome to the main event.</i>

04:41.684 --> 04:43.284
- Let's go, Bobby!
- You got it, boy.

04:47.434 --> 04:48.517
<i>Ouch!</i>

04:48.601 --> 04:50.059
<i>- That's gotta hurt!</i>
- Whoo-hoo!

04:50.183 --> 04:52.976
Damn straight!

04:54.559 --> 04:56.183
This looks so hard.

04:56.267 --> 04:59.309
Yeah, not yet,
but I'm sure you could get me there.

05:08.934 --> 05:10.809
<i>It's a knockout!</i>

05:10.892 --> 05:12.642
What?

05:12.726 --> 05:13.809
Whoa!

05:15.767 --> 05:17.059
Sorry.

05:17.183 --> 05:19.225
I didn't hear you, asshole.

05:19.309 --> 05:20.309
Sorry.

05:22.183 --> 05:25.225
She did the 30 Day Shred.
Jillian Michaels changed her life.

05:31.183 --> 05:33.434
You could use your abilities
for something more useful.

05:33.517 --> 05:35.976
I mean, you can fly...
well, jump.

05:36.059 --> 05:38.642
It's more like guided falling.
Hey, I have an idea.

05:38.726 --> 05:40.976
Why don't you put on a cape
and go run around New York?

05:41.059 --> 05:42.225
You know I would if I could.

05:43.434 --> 05:44.726
I don't get you.

05:44.809 --> 05:49.892
You have money, looks, a radio show,
creepy, if not adoring, fans

05:49.976 --> 05:52.934
and you're a freaking household name.
What more do you want?

05:53.018 --> 05:54.475
To save the world, of course.

05:55.726 --> 05:58.934
You wanna be a hero?
I'll show you how to be a hero.

06:01.059 --> 06:04.350
Shots on Trish Walker, everybody!

06:06.601 --> 06:08.434
<i>There's before Kilgrave...</i>

06:10.142 --> 06:12.059
and there's after Kilgrave.

06:15.684 --> 06:17.142
Oh, my God.

06:18.018 --> 06:21.309
That photo was taken just six months ago.

06:21.392 --> 06:23.475
<i>Then Kilgrave got a hold of him.</i>

06:23.559 --> 06:26.183
<i>I hear him shuffling down the hall</i>
every morning

06:26.267 --> 06:28.892
<i>at a quarter to 10:00, like clockwork.</i>

06:28.976 --> 06:32.392
<i>Junkies aren't known</i>
<i>for keeping a regular schedule.</i>

06:33.559 --> 06:36.392
<i>I never thought</i>
<i>too much about it. But...</i>

07:52.934 --> 07:54.726
Main Street.

07:54.809 --> 07:56.892
Birch Street.

07:56.976 --> 07:58.934
Higgins Asshole Drive.

08:02.642 --> 08:04.434
Oh, shit!

08:35.142 --> 08:37.475
<i>Four months ago,</i>
<i>he also moved in down the hall.</i>

08:38.267 --> 08:39.642
<i>After Kilgrave got him hooked.</i>

08:39.726 --> 08:41.726
That's a lot of effort on Kilgrave's part.

08:41.808 --> 08:43.018
It's a good cover, though.

08:44.058 --> 08:45.809
Everybody dismisses a junkie.

08:46.892 --> 08:48.559
Malcolm's got a knack for spying.

08:48.642 --> 08:52.018
It could be his alt career
if Kilgrave doesn't OD him first.

08:53.267 --> 08:54.934
We'll pull him out.

08:57.225 --> 08:59.350
Not before I get Kilgrave.

09:47.726 --> 09:50.350
Excuse me, excuse me.
What did you just tell that man?

09:50.434 --> 09:52.892
- Sorry, I'm late.
- Please, I'm just trying to help a friend.

09:52.976 --> 09:55.434
I told him to go to
the kiosk on 16th, off Park.

09:55.517 --> 09:56.517
Why?

09:56.601 --> 09:59.809
Some British guy said to find the man
wearing a blue and white scarf and...

09:59.892 --> 10:01.767
I don't have time for this.

10:14.392 --> 10:17.142
Hey pal, you gonna
buy something or what?

10:18.350 --> 10:20.559
This isn't a public library.

10:23.392 --> 10:26.851
Hey buddy, I'm talking to you.
You want me to call the cops?

10:26.934 --> 10:27.934
Hey!

10:28.018 --> 10:29.976
I said this isn't a library.

10:30.059 --> 10:32.059
Pick up that coffee.

10:32.142 --> 10:33.684
Throw it in your face.

10:33.767 --> 10:35.100
Come on, junkie.

10:38.309 --> 10:39.601
Are you okay?

10:41.976 --> 10:44.976
Check your damn messages, Trish.
I know what he's doing.

10:45.934 --> 10:49.517
I mean, how he's meeting.
Whatever. Call me.

11:03.475 --> 11:04.642
Shit.

11:09.892 --> 11:11.059
Ah.

11:23.475 --> 11:26.434
- Who is it?
- Your neighbor, Ruben.

11:35.183 --> 11:37.350
I heard a crash and got worried about you.

11:37.434 --> 11:38.517
Everything okay?

11:39.767 --> 11:41.142
- I'm fine.
- Oh...

11:41.225 --> 11:44.809
Me and my sister have been baking all day.
I brought you some banana bread.

11:46.309 --> 11:49.517
Don't tell her, okay?
Do you like banana bread?

11:50.892 --> 11:52.018
No.

12:24.183 --> 12:26.350
Trish, it's me.

12:28.684 --> 12:31.851
What the hell, Trish?
The doorman told me you're home!

12:31.934 --> 12:33.559
Uh, can you come back later?

12:34.183 --> 12:35.851
Later?

12:35.934 --> 12:39.767
You said you wanted to help Malcolm.
It's time to put on your cape.

12:42.475 --> 12:45.559
We'll never know where Malcolm
is going to meet Kilgrave.

12:45.642 --> 12:48.809
Because he compels someone at the
last minute to tell Malcolm where to go.

12:50.267 --> 12:54.267
Kilgrave's taking precautions because
he knows you're onto Malcolm?

12:54.350 --> 12:58.018
No, or Malcolm would be dead.
But he's not gonna let me sneak up on him.

12:58.059 --> 13:00.851
So I need to deliver the sufentanil
with a long-range dart gun.

13:00.934 --> 13:03.059
Won't work if he's on the move.

13:03.142 --> 13:04.976
A long-range sniper attack takes setup.

13:05.059 --> 13:07.809
Your subject needs to be
in a predetermined location,

13:07.892 --> 13:09.934
preferably removed from civilians.

13:11.934 --> 13:14.601
So, I guess you're over him
trying to kill you and all.

13:14.684 --> 13:17.767
It'll take a pistol.
Up close and personal.

13:17.851 --> 13:20.684
- He'll be dead before he hits the ground.
- I need him alive, Rambo.

13:21.225 --> 13:24.350
I'll keep him doped up,
I just need a place to stash him.

13:24.434 --> 13:26.475
A bullet to the head is more effective.

13:26.559 --> 13:30.142
Not for the girl who's sitting in prison,
taking the blame for his murders.

13:30.225 --> 13:33.225
Without proof that he exists, she's done.
And that's on me.

13:33.309 --> 13:34.934
So this is my call.

13:35.018 --> 13:36.642
My call.

13:36.726 --> 13:38.726
Look, whatever abilities you have,

13:38.809 --> 13:42.350
I'm guessing they don't include
rendition, exfiltration,

13:42.434 --> 13:44.601
and isolation of enemy combatants.

13:45.475 --> 13:46.726
He's a war hero.

13:46.809 --> 13:50.309
He's also the guy who was
filled with remorse about attacking you,

13:50.392 --> 13:52.809
until he decided to turn it
into a booty call.

13:52.892 --> 13:55.517
- That is not what happened.
- And not your business, Jess.

13:55.601 --> 13:59.309
As long as I don't have to work with him.
I need you to rent a van and drive.

13:59.392 --> 14:02.225
You still don't have a license?
What is it with you and cars?

14:02.309 --> 14:04.475
- Wait, Trish is the driver?
- I'm in.

14:04.559 --> 14:06.934
No, no, no. One of my boys
from my old unit will drive.

14:07.018 --> 14:08.018
The hell he will!

14:08.100 --> 14:10.018
But we need someone who's trained,
not a talk radio host.

14:10.100 --> 14:13.018
Hey, last night was fun,
but that doesn't mean I want your opinion.

14:13.100 --> 14:14.183
I know I don't.

14:15.392 --> 14:18.059
You're right, I'm out of line.
I'm sorry.

14:20.642 --> 14:22.267
Oh!

14:23.642 --> 14:27.517
Damn it. I have to be on air in an hour.
You know what? Screw it, I'll cancel.

14:27.601 --> 14:29.601
No, things have to appear
normal to Kilgrave.

14:29.684 --> 14:30.726
I can help.

14:30.809 --> 14:33.517
- Thanks, but I don't need you.
- Uh, yeah, you do.

14:33.601 --> 14:34.726
No, she doesn't.

14:35.684 --> 14:37.142
But seriously, he could be useful.

14:43.851 --> 14:46.684
Okay, great! So call me later
and fill me in on the plan.

14:51.309 --> 14:53.642
- I'll just grab some pants.
- Good call.

15:00.475 --> 15:02.018
You'll have to come in close.

15:02.059 --> 15:03.767
A dart gun's accurate
up to 20 feet.

15:03.851 --> 15:07.892
He'll always keep his back to a wall.
He'll see you coming.

15:07.976 --> 15:10.976
He won't see me.

15:11.059 --> 15:13.726
If you're so great,
why'd they let you out of Spec Ops?

15:15.392 --> 15:18.100
- It's classified.
- Of course it is.

15:28.601 --> 15:33.100
This is a safe house?
It looks like a '70s furniture outlet.

15:35.642 --> 15:40.559
The second floor is
a decommissioned CDC facility.

15:40.642 --> 15:44.059
One of my boys was their investigator.
Held some patient zeros here.

15:44.142 --> 15:47.475
It has a hermetically sealed room.

15:48.392 --> 15:50.892
- You know a lot of commando shit.
- Yep.

15:50.976 --> 15:53.434
But you don't know anything
when it comes to Kilgrave.

15:53.517 --> 15:54.601
- Right.
- Wrong.

15:56.475 --> 15:58.018
Right, meaning, I don't know.

15:58.100 --> 16:00.350
Anything. You don't know anything.

16:01.309 --> 16:02.475
I don't know anything.

16:02.559 --> 16:04.767
Just show me this
hermetically sealed room.

16:05.726 --> 16:08.892
- No, I do know one thing.
- Oh, Christ.

16:10.183 --> 16:12.642
I know tomorrow is too soon
to move on Kilgrave.

16:13.475 --> 16:16.350
- An exfil takes planning.
- I have a plan.

16:16.434 --> 16:19.934
Plus, Kilgrave knows I have the photos.
He knows I'll figure out it's Malcolm.

16:20.018 --> 16:22.726
Yeah, true.
You know, I figured out it was Malcolm.

16:22.809 --> 16:24.601
You dismissed him
just like I did.

16:24.684 --> 16:27.809
Well, all the more reason
not to go in half-assed.

16:30.434 --> 16:33.642
It's soundproof, too.
Nothing gets in or out.

16:33.726 --> 16:37.559
I can rig a safeguard,
but I need till day after tomorrow.

16:37.642 --> 16:38.809
And that's a Sunday.

16:38.892 --> 16:41.726
It's a commercial area.
It'll be dead. No witnesses.

16:41.809 --> 16:44.267
- Fine, day after tomorrow.
- Good.

16:44.350 --> 16:47.183
You just get me close enough
to dart him and grab him up.

16:47.267 --> 16:49.018
You dart him,
I grab him up.

16:50.018 --> 16:54.018
A woman running an unconscious man
through Union Square to a van.

16:54.100 --> 16:56.559
- That's not conspicuous at all.
- Not if I'm quick.

16:57.183 --> 16:59.183
Someone might try to stop you to help.

16:59.267 --> 17:00.309
How fast is your mile?

17:00.392 --> 17:02.059
- Six minutes.
- Under four.

17:03.642 --> 17:06.018
Fine, you grab him up.

17:06.059 --> 17:07.976
Just go inside.

17:08.059 --> 17:10.392
Listen, once he's in here, he'll become...

17:15.976 --> 17:18.601
...can you?
You can't hear me, huh? Anything?

17:20.684 --> 17:23.474
You G.I. Joe.
You definitely have a screw loose.

17:23.559 --> 17:27.517
I'm guessing you left the military
because you gunned down a small village.

17:29.267 --> 17:33.100
So, what, you think because you have
these abilities, you're a hero?

17:33.183 --> 17:35.726
I've seen heroes.
You're not even close.

17:41.225 --> 17:46.018
Two for one hoagies all day.
Two for one hoagies all day.

17:46.059 --> 17:50.059
Two for one.
Two for one hoagies all day.

17:51.559 --> 17:53.642
Two for one hoagies all day.

17:55.809 --> 17:57.851
Two for one hoagies.

17:57.934 --> 17:59.517
Two for one hoagies.

18:09.142 --> 18:11.225
Hey, get off the road,
you stupid sandwich!

18:11.809 --> 18:12.851
Hi.

18:14.726 --> 18:16.517
Sweetie, I told you to stay close.

18:17.475 --> 18:18.892
The sandwich saved me.

18:20.267 --> 18:21.976
Thank you.

18:36.309 --> 18:37.309
Is he alive?

18:40.684 --> 18:42.976
We should take him to a hospital.

18:43.059 --> 18:45.475
Maybe they'll put him into rehab.

18:45.559 --> 18:48.183
He's better off in his own bed.

18:48.267 --> 18:49.851
He might OD.

18:53.059 --> 18:54.559
I'm taking him home.

19:10.475 --> 19:11.892
You wanna go to a movie sometime?

19:17.434 --> 19:19.475
I borrowed it from a buddy.

19:19.559 --> 19:23.142
No rental record.
Nondescript. False plates.

19:23.225 --> 19:24.851
Your basic pedophile's
kidnapping van.

19:24.934 --> 19:27.642
- Yeah.
- And it has automatic transmission.

19:28.392 --> 19:31.767
You know, I could've driven
a stick shift if necessary.

19:31.851 --> 19:33.309
Wasn't necessary.

19:33.392 --> 19:37.142
- Seriously, Simpson.
- Stop worrying. I'm an excellent driver.

19:37.225 --> 19:39.976
Yeah, I read that about you
on your Wikipedia page.

19:41.309 --> 19:43.392
You've been googling me.

19:43.475 --> 19:45.059
Highest-paid child star
in television history?

19:45.142 --> 19:46.225
That's a pretty charmed life.

19:46.309 --> 19:48.726
Yeah, nothing but sunshine and rainbows.

19:48.851 --> 19:50.392
And apparently you're a saint.

19:50.475 --> 19:52.642
You know, the part where you took in
an orphan named Jessica

19:52.726 --> 19:53.851
when her family died?

19:55.559 --> 19:59.350
So, uh, she get her powers
in that car accident?

19:59.434 --> 20:01.934
What exactly can she do?

20:02.018 --> 20:03.892
You won't find that on Wikipedia.

20:11.684 --> 20:13.484
Well, you know,
she's strong, that's for sure,

20:13.517 --> 20:16.100
and I'm guessing she has other powers?

20:17.100 --> 20:20.392
If you want to know about Jessica,
why don't you just talk to Jessica?

20:21.309 --> 20:23.142
I don't think she likes me very much.

20:23.225 --> 20:25.892
She's protective.
She doesn't like any of the guys I date.

20:25.976 --> 20:28.475
Right. And you approve
of all of her boyfriends?

20:28.559 --> 20:32.559
They never stick around
long enough for me to form an opinion.

20:32.642 --> 20:36.350
- Yeah, she probably scares guys off.
- You should stop there.

20:37.267 --> 20:39.434
I need to know who I'm throwing in with.

20:43.267 --> 20:44.434
Do you trust me?

20:45.267 --> 20:46.267
With?

20:47.976 --> 20:51.142
Do you trust that
I'm a decent human being?

20:52.934 --> 20:55.183
- I know you are.
- And I know Jessica is.

20:56.100 --> 20:57.934
And I'm pretty sure you are, too.

20:58.851 --> 21:01.100
And that is all any of us
need to know right now.

21:03.684 --> 21:04.851
Fair enough.

21:05.809 --> 21:08.851
Though, uh,
I would like to see your license.

21:17.183 --> 21:19.059
Yes.

21:49.684 --> 21:50.684
- Hope?
<i>- Collect call from</i>

21:50.767 --> 21:52.392
<i>Northeastern Correctional Facility.</i>

21:52.475 --> 21:54.267
<i>- Do you accept the charges?</i>
- Yes, I'll accept.

21:54.350 --> 21:55.392
<i>Jessica?</i>

21:55.475 --> 21:56.934
Hope, are you all right?

22:15.350 --> 22:16.892
Did you bring it?

22:16.976 --> 22:18.892
You've lost weight.
Are you sick?

22:18.976 --> 22:20.851
Did you bring the money?

22:20.934 --> 22:23.517
You still haven't told me what it's for.

22:23.601 --> 22:26.642
Candy, cigarettes.
What do you care?

22:30.684 --> 22:32.601
I'll have Hogarth put money
in your commissary account.

22:32.684 --> 22:35.392
Did you bring the cash or not?

22:35.475 --> 22:38.059
'Cause if not, visiting hours are over.

22:38.142 --> 22:40.642
Hey, I'm doing everything I can
to get you out of here.

22:40.726 --> 22:42.684
- Just give it to me.
- Hope-ster.

22:44.434 --> 22:46.976
Come on.
Our show's coming on.

22:47.934 --> 22:49.392
I'll be right there, Sissy.

22:55.684 --> 22:57.267
Please.

23:10.517 --> 23:13.267
I'm close, Hope,
to getting him.

23:17.267 --> 23:18.934
I'll hold my breath.

23:21.976 --> 23:22.976
This is it!

23:23.059 --> 23:24.767
This is the one.

23:24.851 --> 23:26.350
- Look!
- Tell me you're kidding.

23:26.434 --> 23:28.559
Superheroes wear costumes.

23:28.642 --> 23:31.601
The only place anyone is
wearing that is trick-or-treating

23:31.684 --> 23:34.018
or as part of some
kinky role-playing scenario.

23:34.059 --> 23:35.225
Well, this is just a mock-up.

23:35.309 --> 23:37.601
Well, ultimately,
it's gonna be a lightweight,

23:37.684 --> 23:40.892
highly durable fabric,
waterproof, flame resistant,

23:40.976 --> 23:42.976
and it will hide your identity.

23:43.059 --> 23:44.517
No.

23:44.601 --> 23:47.475
Well, you can't keep saving people
dressed as a giant hoagie!

23:47.559 --> 23:48.559
Put on that mask.

23:49.851 --> 23:51.225
Fine.

23:53.059 --> 23:54.142
Oh, this is rad.

24:00.475 --> 24:02.018
Try and hit me now.

24:02.059 --> 24:04.018
Fine...

24:04.059 --> 24:05.309
be the naked superhero.

24:05.392 --> 24:06.642
That can be your alias.

24:06.726 --> 24:08.646
Well, it's better than the name
you came up with.

24:08.684 --> 24:10.309
Jewel is a great superhero name.

24:10.392 --> 24:14.183
Jewel is a stripper's name,
a really slutty stripper.

24:14.267 --> 24:16.434
And if I wear that thing,
you're gonna have to call me Cameltoe.

24:16.517 --> 24:18.684
Okay, okay, fine.

24:23.517 --> 24:24.809
So, you're really gonna do it?

24:25.934 --> 24:27.976
You're gonna be a hero.

24:30.267 --> 24:31.851
We'll see.

25:00.350 --> 25:01.934
Going down?

25:02.018 --> 25:03.309
Thanks.

25:44.350 --> 25:45.642
Hey!

25:48.559 --> 25:50.392
Hang in there.

25:50.475 --> 25:52.309
Yeah, you too.

26:06.809 --> 26:08.601
These are dialed into
the conference number.

26:09.475 --> 26:11.392
- Hello? Can you hear me?
- Check.

26:11.475 --> 26:13.434
- Get the van as close as you can.
- On it.

26:13.517 --> 26:15.018
Yeah,
just don't let anyone see you.

26:15.059 --> 26:18.350
And you're gonna have to haul ass
to the sealed room before he wakes up.

26:18.434 --> 26:19.976
Got it.

26:20.059 --> 26:23.018
If anyone walks up, just pretend to be
on the phone. Do not engage.

26:23.059 --> 26:25.892
She's a celebrity,
she's used to dealing with weirdos.

26:25.976 --> 26:27.225
Usually.

26:27.309 --> 26:29.350
Yeah, well, she's dealt with you
all these years, so...

26:29.434 --> 26:32.100
Okay, let's go back to tense silence,
I think.

26:39.684 --> 26:40.892
It's time.

26:49.225 --> 26:51.976
- If Kilgrave gets me...
- I'll take you out.

26:52.059 --> 26:56.559
I was gonna say, "Dart gun me."
But sure, shoot me in the head.

26:56.642 --> 26:58.350
Same here.

26:59.559 --> 27:02.225
- Come on.
- Come and get me.

27:10.726 --> 27:13.059
- <i>Is everyone in position?</i>
- I'm ready.

27:15.142 --> 27:16.267
Standing by.

27:46.018 --> 27:47.225
Here we go.

28:17.559 --> 28:19.434
He's exiting the park at 16th Street.

28:26.475 --> 28:29.934
Outdoor café, 16th Street
and Union Square West.

28:34.475 --> 28:36.155
I'll park at the corner,
a half block down.

29:08.267 --> 29:09.350
Oh!

29:09.434 --> 29:12.183
Sorry about that. Here we go.
Let's start all over again.

29:12.267 --> 29:14.642
Shit. Turn back.

29:14.726 --> 29:16.046
I'm almost in position.

29:16.100 --> 29:18.475
No, he's looking right at you.
If he sees the gun...

29:18.559 --> 29:20.976
I have a shot, I'm taking it.

29:24.475 --> 29:25.684
Oh, hell.

29:25.767 --> 29:26.767
Hey!

29:26.851 --> 29:29.100
Hey, shithead!
Over here!

29:53.225 --> 29:54.726
Whoa, whoa! Is he all right?

29:55.475 --> 29:56.809
Call 911.

29:58.601 --> 30:01.350
I'm sorry, I... I had to...

30:01.434 --> 30:04.475
- Excuse us, ma'am, we got this.
- Hey, hey, sorry.

30:06.434 --> 30:07.726
Help! They just attacked my brother!

30:07.809 --> 30:09.018
I'm calling an ambulance.

30:09.100 --> 30:11.180
No, it's too late.
I have to get him to the hospital.

30:14.601 --> 30:16.976
Trish, I'm coming to you.

30:17.059 --> 30:19.976
<i>- There's two guys right behind me.</i>
- Guys? What guys?

30:22.976 --> 30:24.475
Let's go! Go! Go!

30:31.434 --> 30:33.059
We're clear.

30:33.142 --> 30:34.809
Yeah.

30:39.267 --> 30:40.684
Jess, we need him alive.

30:41.392 --> 30:42.767
I remember.

30:50.267 --> 30:51.726
See? He's alive.

31:06.892 --> 31:09.059
- Okay, let's get him inside.
- Quickly and quietly.

31:09.142 --> 31:10.601
Wait, there's something...

31:10.684 --> 31:13.018
Shit! He's wearing a tracker!

31:13.059 --> 31:14.892
Oh, God.
Let's get out of here! Go!

31:14.976 --> 31:16.392
Go! Go! Drive!

31:16.475 --> 31:17.892
Trish!

31:27.309 --> 31:30.018
You're being controlled, assholes!

32:01.726 --> 32:04.392
Hey! She won't go down!

32:04.475 --> 32:06.756
- Come on!
- It's not working.

32:10.642 --> 32:12.934
Hit her again!

32:13.018 --> 32:14.778
- Do it again!
- Grab his legs.

32:15.601 --> 32:17.601
- Come on!
- Stay down!

32:19.726 --> 32:21.486
All right,
all right. Let's go!

32:54.309 --> 32:55.350
I'm sorry.

32:55.434 --> 32:57.267
We were outmanned.

32:57.350 --> 33:00.309
One taze and I'm useless.

33:00.392 --> 33:02.018
Don't, okay?

33:02.059 --> 33:04.018
I'm just a goddamn radio talk show host.

33:04.059 --> 33:06.642
I can't do that thing where
I make you feel better, all right?

33:06.726 --> 33:07.726
I don't know how.

33:08.434 --> 33:09.684
He's coming to.

33:13.434 --> 33:14.726
Hey.

33:16.018 --> 33:17.142
You did good.

33:28.475 --> 33:31.517
No, no, no, no, no.

33:31.601 --> 33:32.767
Where'd they take Kilgrave?

33:32.851 --> 33:35.934
- We know what he did to you.
- Did to me?

33:36.018 --> 33:38.559
There's a pain center...

33:38.642 --> 33:40.100
- right below the kneecap.
- Oh, come on, man.

33:40.183 --> 33:42.183
- That's not necessary...
- Forget it.

33:42.309 --> 33:44.684
You could torture him until he's dead,
he's not gonna tell us anything.

33:44.767 --> 33:45.767
He's not in control.

33:45.851 --> 33:48.517
I am in total control.
You don't need to torture. Ah!

33:48.601 --> 33:50.767
Wait, Kilgrave
didn't tell you to do this?

33:50.851 --> 33:51.892
Is he a client?

33:51.976 --> 33:53.350
I never spoke to him.

33:53.434 --> 33:56.475
- But you work for that psychopath?
- No, I work for a firm.

33:56.559 --> 33:58.059
I just guard who I'm told.

33:58.183 --> 34:00.225
The client thought
that he might get attacked.

34:00.809 --> 34:04.601
Frankly, I just thought he was some
paranoid nutjob with a lot of cash.

34:04.684 --> 34:06.726
Oh, my God,
I'm such a goddamn idiot.

34:06.809 --> 34:08.726
Kilgrave knew I had the surgical drugs.

34:08.809 --> 34:10.641
- Malcolm would have told him.
- He's lying.

34:10.726 --> 34:12.141
Oh, come on, man!

34:12.225 --> 34:13.350
I mean, the job pays well,

34:13.434 --> 34:15.183
but not good enough
to lose a kneecap over.

34:15.266 --> 34:16.266
You know what I mean?

34:16.350 --> 34:19.851
Kilgrave knew he needed paid backup,
in case he lost his ability.

34:19.934 --> 34:21.225
Where'd they take him?

34:21.309 --> 34:23.559
They don't tell us until we need it.

34:23.641 --> 34:25.641
It's a precaution.
I just show up.

34:25.726 --> 34:26.934
Forget it.
He doesn't know.

34:27.018 --> 34:29.976
Names of your firm,
names of the boys in your detail,

34:30.059 --> 34:31.350
how Kilgrave stayed in contact.

34:31.434 --> 34:32.726
Sure, yeah.
Whatever you need.

34:32.809 --> 34:35.309
Doesn't matter, he's just gonna
change it all when he wakes up, anyway.

34:35.391 --> 34:37.516
Well, I'll just make sure.

34:38.225 --> 34:40.684
- Then we can go find your junkie friend.
- Come here.

34:44.391 --> 34:45.976
I'll find him.

34:46.059 --> 34:50.851
You come to terms with this guy
and that means serve and protect.

34:50.934 --> 34:53.766
You're a cop, Simpson, remember?

34:59.059 --> 35:01.517
- Why not?
- You know what you need?

35:06.892 --> 35:08.142
You don't understand.

35:08.225 --> 35:10.934
- Oh, I understand, all right.
- I understand you full of shit.

35:11.018 --> 35:15.059
- Look, I'm sick.
- I... I gotta have it. Now, please.

35:15.183 --> 35:16.392
You made me come
all the way over here,

35:16.475 --> 35:17.726
and you ain't even got the money?

35:17.809 --> 35:20.059
- Bitch, please.
- No, but you can have my TV, all right?

35:20.183 --> 35:21.517
And this printer.

35:21.601 --> 35:24.601
I got a better TV than that.
Got the HD and everything.

35:24.684 --> 35:26.524
And what the hell
am I gonna do with a printer?

35:26.559 --> 35:28.309
You don't understand.
I need it!

35:28.392 --> 35:29.684
Now, please, just give it to me!

35:29.767 --> 35:32.767
Come a step closer
and I'll shoot your dick off.

35:33.642 --> 35:34.642
Stay back!

35:39.183 --> 35:42.475
Well, if your bitch here got any money,
we can still do a deal if you want.

35:42.559 --> 35:43.726
No.

35:43.809 --> 35:45.267
No, what the hell are you doing?

35:45.350 --> 35:47.142
No, you let go of me!

35:54.726 --> 35:56.726
God damn it, you can't save me.

36:02.642 --> 36:04.559
You can't save me again.

36:09.392 --> 36:10.992
Give me your wallet.

36:12.851 --> 36:14.018
Give me your wallet, asswipe.

36:14.100 --> 36:16.684
Just end him, bro.
He saw our faces.

36:45.934 --> 36:48.142
All right!

36:48.225 --> 36:50.100
Yes!

36:50.183 --> 36:54.601
That was absolutely tremendous!
I thought I was good.

36:54.684 --> 36:58.642
You are a sight to behold.
Isn't she amazing?

36:58.726 --> 37:00.434
- Yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.

37:00.517 --> 37:03.183
You bore me.
Leave. Go on.

37:04.018 --> 37:06.434
- Leave him. He's fine.
- Yeah, he's fine.

37:07.892 --> 37:13.559
Here I am, just debating where to eat,
and then, bam, there you are!

37:14.601 --> 37:17.392
Performing feats of heroism.

37:17.475 --> 37:19.434
Come here, let me look at you.
Come on.

37:21.851 --> 37:26.225
Jesus, you're a vision.
Hair and skin.

37:27.350 --> 37:30.142
Appalling sense of fashion,
but that can be remedied.

37:31.642 --> 37:33.684
And underneath it all, the power.

37:34.809 --> 37:36.767
Just like me.

37:36.851 --> 37:38.767
Though not quite as good, of course.

37:41.142 --> 37:44.892
Tell me, did you enjoy
beating those thugs?

37:44.976 --> 37:46.976
- Yes.
- Yeah?

37:47.059 --> 37:48.601
Why?

37:48.684 --> 37:52.434
Because I helped someone.
I made a difference.

37:54.475 --> 37:57.726
Well, how noble.

37:57.809 --> 37:59.559
What's your name?

37:59.642 --> 38:00.934
Jones. Jessica Jones.

38:01.018 --> 38:04.434
No, no, no, your superhero name.
You must have one.

38:05.601 --> 38:08.183
Just Jessica Jones.

38:08.267 --> 38:09.267
Really?

38:09.350 --> 38:11.183
Hmm. Rather prosaic, but it's fine.

38:11.267 --> 38:15.100
Fine, Jessica Jones, fine.

38:15.183 --> 38:18.726
There's a fantastic Szechuan place
around the corner.

38:18.809 --> 38:21.976
You like Chinese.
Come on.

38:23.517 --> 38:27.601
Come on.
I have to know everything about you.

38:44.475 --> 38:47.517
I made you
a peanut butter sandwich.

38:47.601 --> 38:49.976
You ate all the chunky.
All I have is smooth.

38:50.059 --> 38:52.183
I am sick.

38:52.267 --> 38:55.892
Yeah, and you're just gonna get sicker,
so try not to miss the toilet.

38:55.976 --> 38:57.350
Go to hell.

38:58.642 --> 39:01.018
Already been there.
So have you.

39:02.100 --> 39:03.475
Fuck, I just...

39:03.559 --> 39:05.934
I need a little bit, you know?

39:06.018 --> 39:08.183
Just... Just to wean myself off.

39:08.267 --> 39:09.747
I'm not gonna help you kill yourself.

39:11.601 --> 39:13.392
I mean, why not?

39:13.475 --> 39:16.767
I'm useless to you.
To anybody.

39:16.851 --> 39:19.142
Yeah, at the moment. Yeah.

39:19.225 --> 39:21.225
But, a while ago,
you were gonna help people.

39:24.392 --> 39:25.517
Social work, right?

39:34.684 --> 39:36.767
Look at me.
Who am I gonna help like this?

39:38.559 --> 39:40.559
You have a choice now.

39:42.684 --> 39:45.684
- I took pictures of you.
- Because he made you.

39:49.767 --> 39:52.018
Sometimes I did it just for the drugs.

39:53.100 --> 39:55.392
Think about it, I met him once a day.

39:56.392 --> 39:57.559
10:00 a.m.

39:59.018 --> 40:01.976
His controls don't last that long.
You know they don't.

40:02.059 --> 40:05.392
That's why he got you hooked,
so you would show up.

40:05.475 --> 40:07.642
I'm telling you
that I had a choice.

40:32.059 --> 40:33.892
Kilgrave will find me.

40:37.350 --> 40:38.892
I'll be dead anyway.

40:42.726 --> 40:45.684
Please just give me my goddamn drugs.

40:45.767 --> 40:48.475
Just give me...
Just give me my goddamn drugs!

40:48.559 --> 40:49.726
You're right.

40:49.809 --> 40:51.434
I can't save you.

41:02.434 --> 41:06.726
The whole time he had me,
there was some part of me that fought.

41:08.225 --> 41:12.350
There was some tiny corner of my brain
that tried to get out.

41:13.726 --> 41:15.601
And I'm still fighting.

41:17.225 --> 41:19.267
I won't stop fighting.

41:21.434 --> 41:23.726
But if you give up...

41:23.809 --> 41:24.934
I lose.

41:27.059 --> 41:28.601
Do you get that?

41:29.726 --> 41:32.475
He did this to you to get at me.

41:34.309 --> 41:35.934
To isolate me.

41:37.059 --> 41:39.309
To make me feel like an infection,

41:39.392 --> 41:43.517
one more person dead
or dying because of me.

41:46.642 --> 41:49.684
So why don't you remember how to be
a goddamn human being again

41:49.767 --> 41:53.976
instead of this self-pitying piece of shit
that he turned you into,

41:54.059 --> 41:55.350
and save me for once?

42:01.851 --> 42:03.267
You choose.

44:42.684 --> 44:45.976
<i>Well, I don't know about you,</i>
<i>but I'm exhausted.</i>

44:47.183 --> 44:49.350
<i>So rare...</i>

44:49.475 --> 44:53.059
for me to feel powerless.

44:53.142 --> 44:54.559
Well, I would have felt it,
had I been conscious.

44:54.642 --> 44:57.350
But in retrospect, it's exhilarating.

44:58.350 --> 45:01.392
My life was literally in your hands.

45:02.059 --> 45:05.059
<i>And I have the bruise to prove it.</i>

45:05.183 --> 45:07.767
<i>Which proves that you want me alive.</i>
Tell me why.

45:12.183 --> 45:15.392
<i>I could just turn up on your doorstep</i>
and make you tell me.

45:20.434 --> 45:22.851
Oh, you're mad about the junkie,
aren't you?

45:22.934 --> 45:25.517
That is completely unfair.

45:25.601 --> 45:27.851
I didn't make him do anything
he didn't want to do.

45:28.517 --> 45:31.392
<i>He was...</i>
He was an addict waiting to happen.

45:33.434 --> 45:35.183
<i>Come on, Jessica.</i>

45:36.350 --> 45:37.684
<i>Come on.</i>

45:39.018 --> 45:41.018
<i>Don't play the hero with me.</i>

45:43.225 --> 45:44.684
Fine, fine.

45:44.767 --> 45:49.059
Pretend you saved the junkie,
but we both know that was down to me.

45:52.642 --> 45:53.892
I tell you what.

45:55.183 --> 45:59.059
I will let him go down
his own self-destructive path.

45:59.142 --> 46:00.475
I won't come near him.

46:01.559 --> 46:03.059
If...

46:04.851 --> 46:06.726
<i>you do his job for him.</i>

46:08.309 --> 46:09.892
<i>Keep the pictures coming.</i>

46:10.934 --> 46:13.601
<i>Say, one a day at 10:00 a.m.?</i>

46:14.517 --> 46:16.684
<i>Don't forget to smile.</i>

46:16.767 --> 46:18.475
<i>Hmm?</i>

46:18.559 --> 46:20.309
<i>Send the picture,</i>
save the junkie.

46:21.517 --> 46:23.976
<i>Sounds like an ad campaign.</i>

46:25.642 --> 46:30.309
<i>Let's start... um, now.</i>

46:33.934 --> 46:35.767
<i>Come on, Jessica.</i>

46:38.309 --> 46:40.225
<i>Tell me we have a deal.</i>

46:44.183 --> 46:46.309
Let me hear your voice.
