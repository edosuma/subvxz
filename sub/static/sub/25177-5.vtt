<i>Previously on </i> Cloak and Dagger...

00:09.687 --> 00:11.143
You mean, you see people's fears, too?

00:11.189 --> 00:13.385
<i>Ironically, I can see their hopes.</i>

00:13.432 --> 00:15.079
Yo, Billy. We found his car

00:15.080 --> 00:16.510
and we're gonna take back
our radio. You comin'?

00:16.572 --> 00:18.709
Nah, man. I'm gonna
stay with my brother.

00:18.710 --> 00:20.289
We're going to the
State Finals next week,

00:20.290 --> 00:22.210
and we're concerned that
you're gonna screw it up for us.

00:24.580 --> 00:26.580
What?

00:28.170 --> 00:30.628
I have a couple questions
to ask you about Roxxon.

00:30.670 --> 00:32.549
- Maybe help.
<i>- I've never turned down free help.</i>

00:32.573 --> 00:34.290
<i>They're leaving a big paper trail.</i>

00:53.727 --> 00:56.106
I joined the Navy to help people.

00:56.194 --> 00:59.153
When I lost my arm
building a hospital in Mosul,

00:59.178 --> 01:00.609
I thought that was it.

01:00.727 --> 01:03.266
Then, Roxxon Gulf approached me

01:03.337 --> 01:06.176
about applying my skills
to the city I called home.

01:06.240 --> 01:09.489
Who says nation building should
only be about other nations?

01:09.603 --> 01:11.522

02:52.407 --> 02:53.697
O'Reilly.

02:55.250 --> 02:57.540
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I'm on my way.

03:03.920 --> 03:05.972
Is that the right model?

03:06.170 --> 03:08.999
Well, no. Mine's got flat handlebars.

03:10.830 --> 03:13.041
Hey, is there any chance
we could talk somewhere else?

03:13.088 --> 03:15.776
Well, there was...
if you'd have given me a heads up

03:15.801 --> 03:18.409
about the topic of conversation
before we started.

03:18.434 --> 03:20.353
Sorry. It's... it's just...

03:20.420 --> 03:21.789
Tandy said I could trust you,

03:21.790 --> 03:23.209
but I-I wasn't sure you'd believe me.

03:23.210 --> 03:25.379
You can't, and I don't.

03:25.380 --> 03:26.829
Not yet.

03:26.830 --> 03:28.919
But this guy Connors,

03:28.920 --> 03:30.619
he gives me an ache in my big toe.

03:30.620 --> 03:33.539
Well, you think we can get him?
For killing my brother?

03:33.540 --> 03:35.250
No.

03:36.500 --> 03:39.249
Technically, it's a crime
that never happened,

03:39.250 --> 03:41.579
and now he's a cop that,
officially, never existed.

03:41.580 --> 03:44.079
But how can an actual
detective not exist?

03:44.080 --> 03:46.039
Vice cops live two separate lives.

03:46.040 --> 03:48.079
The department does
everything in their power

03:48.080 --> 03:49.940
to hide the trace of the real one.

03:50.026 --> 03:52.518
What if you could get him
on something else?

03:52.580 --> 03:53.830
Like dealing drugs.

03:55.750 --> 03:57.379
What are you talking about?

03:57.380 --> 03:59.272
I saw him meet up with
this guy over on Lamanche

03:59.297 --> 04:00.960
with these big bricks of cocaine.

04:02.080 --> 04:04.329
He said he lifted it from evidence.

04:04.330 --> 04:06.480
It was tested by the NOPD.

04:06.920 --> 04:08.574
96% pure.

04:08.617 --> 04:11.206
- Can you describe the man he met?
- No, it was dark.

04:11.380 --> 04:12.500
By some warehouses.

04:13.620 --> 04:15.039
I could, um...

04:15.040 --> 04:16.959
I could cruise over there,
see if I can spot any...

04:16.959 --> 04:19.539
No, no! You know what? Leave
the police work to the police.

04:19.540 --> 04:21.829
I don't need someone
going off and being a hero.

04:21.829 --> 04:24.459
- I mean, I-I can help.
- You wanna help?

04:24.460 --> 04:26.289
Stay alive.

04:26.290 --> 04:27.999
Go on and be a kid, okay?

04:56.170 --> 04:58.119
You didn't have to do all this.

04:58.120 --> 04:59.830
Can't take the credit.

05:04.040 --> 05:05.919
What the hell are you doing here?

05:05.920 --> 05:07.959
Last I saw you, you were
calling me a choir boy.

05:07.960 --> 05:10.447
Last I saw you, you were storming
out of my church like one.

05:12.750 --> 05:14.212
Sorry I got my harsh on.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.830
Seriously, what are you doing here?

05:16.861 --> 05:19.959
- I come bearing good news.
- And what's that?

05:19.960 --> 05:21.419
I did it.

05:21.420 --> 05:23.329
I controlled it.

05:23.330 --> 05:24.500
I made it happen.

05:26.673 --> 05:27.963
Check it.

05:34.960 --> 05:36.749
Can you not?

05:36.750 --> 05:38.669
Not here.

05:38.670 --> 05:41.289
But here is interesting.

05:41.290 --> 05:44.419
Tyrone Johnson in his natural habitat.

05:44.420 --> 05:46.619
Hey, I don't know if Betty and
Veronica decorated your locker,

05:46.620 --> 05:48.789
but she's in it to win it,
you know that?

05:48.790 --> 05:50.169
I can't with you right now.

05:50.170 --> 05:52.079
You can for one more thing.

05:52.080 --> 05:54.182
Do you guys have
a computer lab or a printer?

06:00.446 --> 06:01.829
I'm shocked you didn't just steal

06:01.830 --> 06:04.149
someone's laptop from a coffee shop.

06:04.290 --> 06:06.547
You were closer than Starbucks.

06:08.138 --> 06:11.109
So, you excited? The big game?

06:11.134 --> 06:14.219
- Mm, sure.
- Yeah, well, you don't sound that excited.

06:14.266 --> 06:15.919
Don't you love basketball?

06:15.920 --> 06:18.487
- Isn't that why you play?
- I used to.

06:18.534 --> 06:19.536
When?

06:19.607 --> 06:22.636
Probably a pick-up game
in my old neighborhood

06:22.674 --> 06:25.034
with me and my brother Billy
against, um...

06:25.120 --> 06:26.619
his boys, Duane and Rockwell.

06:26.620 --> 06:29.669
They ran me ragged,
blocked every single shot.

06:29.670 --> 06:33.079
Then, when my legs went rubber,

06:33.080 --> 06:35.829
Billy would, um, boost me up.

06:35.830 --> 06:38.575
- Slam dunk.
- Sounds like a good brother.

06:39.200 --> 06:40.860
Yeah.

06:42.620 --> 06:45.709
So, um, what are you doing
with all this Roxxon stuff?

06:45.710 --> 06:47.959
Well, I've been looking
at my dad's old papers,

06:47.960 --> 06:49.437
trying to connect the dots,

06:49.492 --> 06:51.499
but there's this hole in the middle.

06:51.524 --> 06:53.094
A hole?

06:53.180 --> 06:55.421
Yeah, a mystery man
at the center of it all.

06:55.460 --> 06:56.929
But the closest I can get are these

06:56.961 --> 06:59.289
B-level corporate foot soldiers.

06:59.290 --> 07:01.579
So I need to put myself in their path.

07:01.650 --> 07:03.954
Wait. How'd you do it?

07:05.040 --> 07:06.879
Your knife thingy.

07:06.880 --> 07:10.119
Oh, turns out it was pretty easy.

07:10.120 --> 07:12.293
Just had to nearly kill myself.

07:14.242 --> 07:16.262
No, it was, uh...

07:16.420 --> 07:18.574
scary as hell.

07:18.710 --> 07:21.710
Like, you couldn't pay me
to do it again, but...

07:22.920 --> 07:24.864
in that moment,

07:25.016 --> 07:27.435
all the other crap just crapped out,

07:27.460 --> 07:30.301
and all of a sudden, whoosh, you know?

07:30.540 --> 07:31.959
No, I don't.

07:31.960 --> 07:34.181
Oh, the other thing
that I was thinking on.

07:34.250 --> 07:37.525
The, um, well, other thing.

07:37.620 --> 07:41.095
Like how when you touch people
you can see their fears?

07:41.180 --> 07:43.116
- Yeah?
- And how when I touch someone,

07:43.170 --> 07:45.170
I can see their hopes.

07:45.615 --> 07:47.274
Why not use it?

07:47.330 --> 07:49.121
Well, what do you mean "use it," Tandy?

07:49.191 --> 07:50.973
Well, people let me in.

07:51.040 --> 07:52.965
Like their hopes are books,

07:53.003 --> 07:54.887
but I'm the only one that can
check 'em out of the library.

07:54.957 --> 07:56.840
I mean, don't you think
that's a violation?

07:56.879 --> 07:58.829
Like you're stealing from them?

07:58.963 --> 08:01.383
The world has stolen
from me my whole life.

08:02.750 --> 08:05.799
My dad, his name, our money.

08:08.710 --> 08:11.709
Maybe I have this thing
so I can steal some of it back.

08:31.670 --> 08:33.201
You killed it in practice, man.

08:33.250 --> 08:35.498
That jump shot? Epic.

08:35.568 --> 08:37.928
Well, maybe that extra time
in the equipment room helped.

08:38.326 --> 08:39.980
You've been first-rate ever since,

08:40.058 --> 08:41.759
so it sure didn't hurt.

08:42.580 --> 08:44.435
One more game.

08:44.645 --> 08:46.684
Yeah, one more game, man.

08:56.330 --> 08:57.630
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:58.427 --> 09:00.666
Your locker was... was pretty great.

09:00.719 --> 09:01.959
So, thank you.

09:02.016 --> 09:04.207
- What are friends for?
- Friends?

09:04.277 --> 09:06.551
Oh, my God!

09:09.290 --> 09:10.620
Oh, my God!

09:11.920 --> 09:13.932
<i>We're now moments away.</i>

09:13.978 --> 09:16.329
<i>Let's give a warm St. Sebastian welcome</i>

09:16.400 --> 09:19.595
<i>to your State Champions!</i>

10:27.049 --> 10:28.638
The only time I've ever seen anybody

10:28.663 --> 10:30.322
stare at a screen so intently,

10:30.350 --> 10:32.322
there was porn on it.

10:32.323 --> 10:34.322
At some later date, you and I
are gonna have a conversation

10:34.323 --> 10:37.322
about why you were watching
someone else watch porn.

10:37.323 --> 10:39.742
- What are you getting into?
- Drug busts.

10:39.792 --> 10:41.767
In Harlem, it was a good way
to leap up the food chain.

10:41.792 --> 10:43.956
Thought maybe I could make some noise.

10:44.033 --> 10:46.282
But New Orleans is a different bird.

10:46.283 --> 10:48.119
Seems like about eight years ago,

10:48.166 --> 10:50.549
Vice busts around the 12th became
fewer and further between.

10:50.623 --> 10:52.323
Our violent crime tally went down too.

10:52.377 --> 10:53.752
Yeah, we call it, "the Devil you know."

10:53.783 --> 10:55.018
Come again?

10:55.042 --> 10:56.729
Back in the day,
the 12th was a disaster...

10:56.815 --> 10:58.608
turf wars, shootings.

10:58.703 --> 11:01.703
Then slowly, but surely, the
dealer dominoes started to fall.

11:03.783 --> 11:05.877
With a lot of help from Connors.

11:06.861 --> 11:08.700
My best guess, he's the intel source

11:08.771 --> 11:10.682
on a ton of these arrests.

11:11.023 --> 11:13.062
I think he moved to Vice about then.

11:13.151 --> 11:16.456
- Probably made some good in-roads.
- That's one way to look at it.

11:16.623 --> 11:17.573
But your way is?

11:17.620 --> 11:21.456
He cleared the field for a
mystery dealer to play Monopoly.

11:21.493 --> 11:23.181
There's still plenty
of product on the street,

11:23.206 --> 11:24.952
but it's flowing from one source.

11:25.003 --> 11:27.821
Maybe you missed the point where
I said the district is safer now?

11:27.884 --> 11:30.641
- I'm not saying that it isn't.
- So what are you saying?

11:30.704 --> 11:32.547
I'm saying that, as a rule,

11:32.608 --> 11:35.568
for every action, there's an
equal and opposite reaction.

11:45.914 --> 11:47.809
Yeah, well, Roxxon is my biggest client,

11:47.834 --> 11:49.873
which means, they're my
biggest pain in the ass.

11:49.935 --> 11:51.599
Everyone needs to be on the list.

11:51.624 --> 11:53.873
- Patron or ticket-holder, everyone.
<i>- Copy that.</i>

11:53.927 --> 11:56.533
<i>And I'll check in Mr. Scarborough's
VIP personally.</i>

11:56.534 --> 11:57.703
Scarborough probably won't show,

11:57.704 --> 11:59.493
and his guests will act
like they own the place,

11:59.494 --> 12:02.293
but they have to have wristbands to
access the lounge. No exceptions.

12:02.294 --> 12:04.357
<i>You sure you can't make it?</i>

12:04.454 --> 12:06.514
<i>You spent six months planning this.</i>

12:06.584 --> 12:08.990
If it was on any other night, I would.

12:09.034 --> 12:12.389
Ty's worked very hard. I need to be
there with him, come win or lose.

12:12.494 --> 12:14.334
- All right, text me later.
<i>- Okay.</i>

12:15.742 --> 12:17.331
Well, hey, I didn't hear you come in.

12:17.364 --> 12:18.774
Didn't want to interrupt.

12:23.994 --> 12:25.743
My boys and basketball.

12:25.744 --> 12:28.663
- Yeah, I'm not nearly as good as he was.
- That's not true.

12:28.741 --> 12:30.570
Billy was more tenacious on "D,"

12:30.603 --> 12:31.743
but you've got stronger legs,

12:31.744 --> 12:33.955
and that jump shot of yours?
It's money in the bank.

12:35.704 --> 12:36.796
You know my whole life was begging

12:36.821 --> 12:38.962
him and his friends
to let me hoop with them.

12:39.034 --> 12:40.493
What happened to those guys?

12:40.494 --> 12:42.743
Well, we moved and we moved on.

12:42.744 --> 12:45.321
I hear one of those boys
did pretty well for himself.

12:45.374 --> 12:48.939
All I ever wanted to be
was like him, with him.

12:50.704 --> 12:54.203
And now everything, all the good
stuff, he's not even there, Mom.

12:54.306 --> 12:55.809
He'll be there tonight.

12:55.834 --> 12:58.623
Winning a title was all
those boys ever talked about.

12:58.757 --> 13:00.256
It was gonna lift them up.

13:00.295 --> 13:01.772
It was gonna get them
out of that old hood,

13:01.842 --> 13:04.859
but they never made it past the semi's.

13:04.954 --> 13:06.859
You in the finals?

13:06.954 --> 13:09.334
Nothing would have made Billy prouder.

13:14.124 --> 13:17.373
- Come on, Mom. Seriously?
- I know. I'm not supposed to hug you.

13:17.374 --> 13:19.084
- I know.
- Come on, come on, come on.

13:49.623 --> 13:50.911
I'm...

13:53.352 --> 13:54.577
Tyrone?

13:55.223 --> 13:58.271
- Duane?
- Oh, man, look at you! What!

13:59.076 --> 14:00.650
Man, I can't believe it.

14:00.678 --> 14:02.404
It's like you picked up on me
thinking about you or something.

14:03.006 --> 14:05.381
Maybe. I-I was...

14:05.534 --> 14:07.533
just looking at this
photo of you guys...

14:07.534 --> 14:08.743
State Finals, baby.

14:08.744 --> 14:11.243
I been bragging to my guys
about how I know you.

14:11.244 --> 14:13.913
The whole neighborhood is more
Hancock High territory.

14:13.914 --> 14:16.179
Me and my boys, we rootin'
for you, you know that.

14:16.204 --> 14:17.833
I need your signature, sir.

14:17.834 --> 14:19.834
Yo, move it on out.

14:25.704 --> 14:27.583
- So, you own this place?
- Yeah.

14:27.584 --> 14:29.367
It runs about ten deep now.

14:29.454 --> 14:30.703
Started off small,

14:30.773 --> 14:33.367
picked up some biz to refurbish
some storm-damaged homes.

14:33.454 --> 14:35.164
- Next thing I know...
- Wow.

14:36.414 --> 14:38.533
Guess I should be the one
lookin' at you then.

14:38.534 --> 14:39.993
Hey, I got lucky.

14:39.994 --> 14:42.493
Found a way to turn
a good deed into a business.

14:42.494 --> 14:43.663
Well, what about you?

14:43.664 --> 14:45.444
Bet you can't wait
to get back on that court.

14:45.469 --> 14:47.293
I'm basically just the sixth man, so...

14:47.367 --> 14:48.953
Man, that is straight up BS.

14:49.023 --> 14:51.101
You got skills, little man.
You always did.

14:52.337 --> 14:53.836
Billy would love to see this.

14:53.946 --> 14:55.196
He'd be about to bust.

14:56.164 --> 14:58.033
I think about him all the time.

14:58.034 --> 15:00.743
The plans we had? That was the dream.

15:00.744 --> 15:02.123
We was making next to nothing

15:02.124 --> 15:04.533
installing car stereos
out of that old-ass garage.

15:05.181 --> 15:08.021
- Being our own men.
- You think that's how it would be?

15:08.454 --> 15:10.083
Have Billy here working with you?

15:10.084 --> 15:11.533
Yeah, if I was lucky.

15:11.534 --> 15:13.948
Billy'd probably be
negotiating all my contracts.

15:14.034 --> 15:16.971
Making me more money on every deal, too.

15:17.164 --> 15:20.221
You know what I learned trying
to fix up those ruined houses?

15:20.334 --> 15:23.655
That you can't change what was.
You can only look ahead.

15:23.744 --> 15:26.538
Make what is matter.
That's how I got here.

15:26.664 --> 15:28.374
Lookin' ahead.

15:29.624 --> 15:31.494
Lookin' ahead doesn't sound that bad.

16:22.744 --> 16:24.583
Why am I not surprised?

16:24.771 --> 16:26.925
Corporate boys like expensive girls.

16:45.164 --> 16:47.556
- Felicity?
- Oh, that's me.

16:56.744 --> 16:58.374
Let me see your phone.

17:03.458 --> 17:05.759
- How many followers?
- 17,000.

17:05.864 --> 17:07.512
But coming up on 18.

17:07.551 --> 17:09.845
- And you post every day?
- Oh, at least twice.

17:09.900 --> 17:12.669
I use one of those timer things
to maximize post exposure.

17:12.733 --> 17:14.892
And report traffic, do like my owns.

17:14.954 --> 17:17.214
- All the tricks they say to do.
- No drug problems?

17:17.275 --> 17:19.579
Does ice cream count?

17:19.605 --> 17:21.684
Have you ever worked atmosphere?

17:21.685 --> 17:23.894
Yeah! Yeah, when I lived in New York,

17:23.895 --> 17:26.227
I used to do club openings
and all that good stuff.

17:26.275 --> 17:28.644
So, they taught you how to tag
and refer when you should,

17:28.645 --> 17:29.934
stay anonymous when you should not?

17:29.935 --> 17:33.092
- Anonymous?
- This is New Orleans.

17:33.463 --> 17:35.922
And some of the men
who foot the bill for our girls,

17:36.071 --> 17:38.360
they expect something in return.

17:38.411 --> 17:39.870
Whether or not you give that to them

17:39.895 --> 17:42.413
- is completely your choice.
- Completely.

17:42.480 --> 17:46.132
But the company cannot be
implicated or the client blamed,

17:46.319 --> 17:48.448
if they take a swing and miss.

17:48.605 --> 17:50.315
You follow?

17:51.254 --> 17:53.083
So long as the check clears,

17:53.225 --> 17:54.975
it's all none of my business.

17:55.935 --> 17:57.515
How soon can you start?

17:59.315 --> 18:00.855
Anything happening tonight?

18:03.275 --> 18:05.270
Coach is gonna kill you
if you're late for intros.

18:05.309 --> 18:07.644
That is, if we both don't get suspended

18:07.645 --> 18:09.395
for breaking into the priest's office.

18:10.895 --> 18:13.741
I wasn't ready before, but I am now.

18:13.855 --> 18:15.605
For what?

18:27.511 --> 18:29.680
Listen, I just... I don't
want you to do something for me

18:29.728 --> 18:31.637
because you think you have to.

18:31.685 --> 18:33.719
All right? That's not who I want us to be.

18:33.849 --> 18:35.728
I mean...

18:35.815 --> 18:37.314
if you don't want it, that's cool too.

18:37.315 --> 18:39.961
I mean, that's not what I'm saying.

18:40.015 --> 18:41.854
See, I totally knew you wanted it.

18:41.855 --> 18:43.506
I was taking pity on you.

18:43.551 --> 18:45.260
- That's all.
- Mm-hmm.

18:59.435 --> 19:02.395
Whenever I get weird or quiet...

19:02.767 --> 19:05.505
maybe this'll remind you that sometimes
it's not actually all that bad.

19:14.275 --> 19:17.065
- I know.
- You do?

19:18.565 --> 19:21.139
I pay attention to you.

19:21.201 --> 19:23.600
L-E-T-S-G-O! Let's go!

19:23.640 --> 19:24.854
Let's go!

19:24.905 --> 19:27.724
L-E-T-S-G-O! Let's go!

19:27.725 --> 19:31.416
Let's go! L-E-T-S-G-O! Let's go!

19:31.441 --> 19:32.780
Let's go!

19:34.815 --> 19:37.385
<i>Well, it all comes down to tonight.</i>

19:37.435 --> 19:40.065
<i>Two teams putting it all on the line</i>

19:40.145 --> 19:42.308
<i>to bring home the glory.</i>

19:42.515 --> 19:44.224
<i>Thirty-two minutes on the clock.</i>

19:44.225 --> 19:46.144
<i>The pressure has never been higher.</i>

19:46.185 --> 19:48.831
<i>The rewards have never been so great.</i>

19:48.886 --> 19:51.605
<i>Tonight, it's one of those
magical nights,</i>

19:51.667 --> 19:53.425
<i>where anything can happen.</i>

20:00.105 --> 20:02.934
<i>Hancock rushes back.
They're moving the ball around</i>

20:02.997 --> 20:05.676
<i>trying to break through this
smothering St. Seb's defense.</i>

20:05.725 --> 20:08.725
<i>Oh! And St. Seb's with the steal!</i>

20:13.855 --> 20:15.104
Foul.

20:15.105 --> 20:17.774
- On one!
- Bullshit! I didn't touch him!

20:17.775 --> 20:20.712
I made my call, son.
I'd take a step back if I were you.

20:20.774 --> 20:22.724
Eleven, you're on the line.

20:40.593 --> 20:41.908
Not gonna lie.

20:41.944 --> 20:44.717
I'm surprised to hear
you haven't made bail.

20:44.815 --> 20:46.354
With only two burglaries...

20:46.355 --> 20:49.778
Turns out I donated all my cash
to an unworthy cause.

20:49.855 --> 20:51.583
You want me to get a message to Bowen?

20:51.685 --> 20:54.355
- She's still in town?
- It's not a problem.

20:56.145 --> 20:58.184
No. No, it's chili spaghetti day,

20:58.185 --> 20:59.712
and I don't want to miss it.

20:59.775 --> 21:01.355
She really did a number on you.

21:02.685 --> 21:04.024
So why'd you drag me over here?

21:04.072 --> 21:07.571
You're here to tell me about the
local nightclub pharmaceutical scene.

21:07.572 --> 21:10.379
- I don't sell drugs.
- But you know someone who does, I bet.

21:10.481 --> 21:11.911
The person with the high-quality coke

21:11.912 --> 21:13.822
who works at the club you adore?

21:15.025 --> 21:16.564
You can sit here

21:16.635 --> 21:19.305
without asking me what
I have to offer for the info.

21:20.822 --> 21:23.347

Do you try and show up at the worst
possible times, or am I just lucky?

25:43.958 --> 25:45.561
I-I didn't try anything, okay?

25:45.586 --> 25:47.546
I was in the locker room at
halftime and now I'm here.

25:48.652 --> 25:50.715
What are you doing at a Roxxon party?

25:50.769 --> 25:52.588
Doing some digging.

25:52.684 --> 25:55.515
Trying to find the mystery man
at the center of everything.

25:55.569 --> 25:58.209
When you say "dig" do you mean
root around in people's heads?

25:58.234 --> 26:00.101
- Why do you care?
- I'm here because of you.

26:00.154 --> 26:02.663
- You did this to me.
- Did what?

26:02.735 --> 26:04.234
You've been experimenting.

26:04.314 --> 26:06.523
Right? With your...
your hopey, touchy thing?

26:06.524 --> 26:08.113
Why? Why does that matter?

26:08.114 --> 26:10.353
It matters because you checked too
many books out of the library,

26:10.354 --> 26:11.510
and I'm paying the fine.

26:11.564 --> 26:13.651
You and I are connected.

26:13.713 --> 26:14.854
And because you're using your shit,

26:14.855 --> 26:16.613
mine has been going haywire all night.

26:16.646 --> 26:19.162
- And it's your fault.
- I didn't do anything to you.

26:19.286 --> 26:22.575
I'm just trying to find this one guy.

26:22.694 --> 26:25.349
This face that keeps
showing up in everybody's hopes.

26:25.965 --> 26:28.704
Honestly, I think I'm pretty close.

26:35.114 --> 26:36.654
What is it?

26:41.564 --> 26:44.524
All night I kept thinking
I've seen this guy before.

26:46.524 --> 26:47.853
I remember him now.

26:47.854 --> 26:50.734
The caption says his
name is Peter Scarborough.

26:52.734 --> 26:54.386
I saw him in your fears.

26:54.468 --> 26:56.730
He was the one leading
the charge against your father.

26:56.814 --> 26:58.614
When I was nine...

26:59.694 --> 27:02.513
he came to my house and tore it apart,

27:02.734 --> 27:05.841
took everything of my dad's
and said it belonged to Roxxon.

27:05.945 --> 27:08.654
- You sure?
- I can't believe I forgot his face.

27:08.734 --> 27:10.613
Definitely won't make
that mistake again.

27:10.683 --> 27:13.253
Yeah, well, listen, I'm...

27:13.290 --> 27:15.218
I'm really sorry about all that.

27:15.314 --> 27:18.147
But, man, you picked...

27:18.234 --> 27:20.780
the wrong time to drag me
into this... this crazy.

27:20.804 --> 27:21.958
Look, I know, I'm sorry.

27:21.983 --> 27:23.733
Can you touch someone
and get me the hell out of here?

27:23.734 --> 27:25.070
I don't think it works like that.

27:25.095 --> 27:26.653
Well, I mean, somehow you got me here,

27:26.689 --> 27:29.517
- so... so figure out how to get me back.
- Okay, well...

27:30.314 --> 27:33.267
- Have you tried that dying thing yet?
- What?

27:33.314 --> 27:35.319
You know, putting yourself at risk.

27:35.354 --> 27:38.100
- No, you... you know I'm not doing that.
- State Finals.

27:38.187 --> 27:40.100
- I know.
- It's all on the line, Tyrone.

27:41.274 --> 27:42.654
You got to let go!

27:55.024 --> 27:56.613
Now, you go show them.

27:56.666 --> 27:59.608
Right now! You slam
the door in their face!

27:59.654 --> 28:02.089
Let's go!

28:17.694 --> 28:19.273
If you have some water and an aspirin

28:19.274 --> 28:21.189
and sit still, it should pass.

28:21.236 --> 28:22.853
Oh.

28:22.854 --> 28:25.314
- I'm not drunk.
- It's a party.

28:25.354 --> 28:27.853
- No one's judging.
- Stage fright.

28:27.906 --> 28:29.633
Looks a lot like too much vodka.

28:29.694 --> 28:31.563
Though maybe vodka would help.

28:31.625 --> 28:34.523
Well, whatever it is,

28:34.609 --> 28:37.601
- break a leg.
- Yeah.

28:37.654 --> 28:42.751
<i>...please give a warm welcome
to Mina Hess.</i>

28:42.854 --> 28:44.272
<i>When I was five years old,</i>

28:44.311 --> 28:46.725
<i>my father once told me
the story of the semi-truck</i>

28:46.779 --> 28:48.773
<i>that got caught under the overpass.</i>

28:49.336 --> 28:51.923
Anything on me is for personal use.

28:52.024 --> 28:53.653
If this is all for personal use,

28:53.654 --> 28:55.704
you got a death wish
or a damn high tolerance.

28:55.759 --> 28:57.751
Maybe I'm just trying to make
my waist seem smaller.

28:57.806 --> 28:59.645
Club Ampersand.

28:59.646 --> 29:01.573
I barely go to that place anymore.

29:01.598 --> 29:03.145
I spoke to one of their ex-bouncers,

29:03.146 --> 29:05.252
and he told me you're
their in-house coke supplier.

29:05.493 --> 29:07.242
Screw you.

29:07.323 --> 29:09.700
Sixty seconds and I call it in.

29:09.794 --> 29:12.395
That can't be undone.
I wanna be very clear on that.

29:16.556 --> 29:18.345
A runner shows up every day,

29:18.382 --> 29:20.211
same time, takes my cash,

29:20.266 --> 29:21.696
hands me more product.

29:21.758 --> 29:23.883
I never see the magic man
who pulls all the strings.

29:23.936 --> 29:26.184
- So I'm of zero use to you.
- All right.

29:27.327 --> 29:29.616
Those bags are $150 each,

29:29.773 --> 29:31.666
worth nearly two grand
without inflation.

29:31.737 --> 29:32.799
Oh, she does math!

29:32.846 --> 29:35.768
I'm saying you brought me here
instead of the station,

29:35.857 --> 29:38.106
which suggests your need
to put me on record

29:38.133 --> 29:40.086
ain't as great as your bluff.

29:40.147 --> 29:41.821
And cop dudes aren't the only ones

29:41.860 --> 29:42.921
who like to party, right?

29:42.946 --> 29:45.968
Look at that. Got so close
to passing the Bechdel Test.

29:46.023 --> 29:47.757
All I'm saying is...

29:47.857 --> 29:48.936
aren't all of you guys

29:48.937 --> 29:51.117
in the same fraternity of loose morals?

29:51.294 --> 29:53.504

33:01.277 --> 33:02.436
Hi!

33:02.437 --> 33:04.341
Hi, look, I'm so sorry to bother you,

33:04.380 --> 33:06.044
but my tire just went flat
all of a sudden

33:06.117 --> 33:08.114
and my phone is cashed.

33:08.178 --> 33:10.137
Would you mind if I borrowed
your phone to call AAA?

33:10.573 --> 33:12.153
I do.

33:14.607 --> 33:16.938
You should know how
to change your own tire.

33:18.279 --> 33:19.448
Oh, look, you know, you...

33:19.485 --> 33:21.064
you really don't have to do that.

33:21.065 --> 33:22.532
Nonsense.

33:22.618 --> 33:24.105
I like getting my hands dirty.

33:29.025 --> 33:30.274
St. Seb's, huh?

33:30.649 --> 33:32.101
Yeah.

33:32.195 --> 33:33.970
Yeah, tough break tonight.

33:34.025 --> 33:35.571
Heard it was a nail biter.

33:35.645 --> 33:37.063
It's just a game.

33:37.145 --> 33:38.695
Fair enough.

35:19.685 --> 35:22.490
So, what colleges are you looking at?

35:22.552 --> 35:23.734
Hmm?

35:44.687 --> 35:45.775
Hey.

35:47.323 --> 35:48.501
What...

35:48.526 --> 35:51.097
Oh, yeah, you should, uh,
probably lock that.

35:51.145 --> 35:53.254
You know, for safety, I mean.

35:53.300 --> 35:54.425
What are you...

35:54.466 --> 35:56.253
I waited for you outside
the locker room.

35:56.278 --> 35:57.894
You never came out.

35:57.919 --> 35:59.997
Yeah, I, um...

36:00.275 --> 36:01.815
I took the long way around.

36:02.815 --> 36:05.191
Walked home, cleared my head.

36:05.285 --> 36:07.034
Besides, I mean, it's...

36:07.105 --> 36:09.525
it's probably better you can
give it back to me in private.

36:11.065 --> 36:12.694
Give it back to you?

36:12.695 --> 36:14.477
Come on, who wants
to wear a loser's jacket?

36:15.565 --> 36:17.149
You are so dense.

36:17.228 --> 36:19.268
What are you talking about?

36:19.815 --> 36:21.275
I know.

36:24.145 --> 36:26.065
- You know what?
- What you did.

36:27.065 --> 36:28.603
With that ref,

36:28.695 --> 36:30.355
and the other team.

36:32.275 --> 36:33.735
I told you.

36:35.025 --> 36:36.435
Pay attention.

36:46.485 --> 36:47.854
I know who you are.

37:12.605 --> 37:14.894
You wanna tell me what the
hell you think you're doing?

37:19.775 --> 37:21.815
And do you have enough to share?

37:24.775 --> 37:25.978
If I was lookin' to bust you,

37:26.009 --> 37:27.822
half the station
would be in here by now.

37:29.435 --> 37:31.383
You're undercover with Vice, right?

37:32.355 --> 37:34.579
So damn long it's hard
to remember when I wasn't.

37:39.565 --> 37:43.123
Ooh. That is top shelf.

37:43.170 --> 37:45.193
Eh, I did two years in Narcotics.

37:45.232 --> 37:48.482
During which, I obviously had
some issues with the whole...

37:48.565 --> 37:50.524
undercover officers may not use drugs

37:50.525 --> 37:52.302
to protect their cover thing.

37:52.341 --> 37:54.314
Stupid rule written by a stupid suit

37:54.372 --> 37:55.802
who never went U.C. in his life!

37:55.833 --> 37:57.958
I worked a guy once
who wouldn't let you in the room

37:58.011 --> 37:59.661
if you wouldn't do a line first.

38:00.695 --> 38:02.024
So, where'd you find the good stuff?

38:02.025 --> 38:04.387
- I might need another hit of that.
- Mm.

38:04.575 --> 38:06.164
Club dealer.

38:06.235 --> 38:08.825
Easiest way to score
without it coming back on you.

38:08.895 --> 38:10.895
Used to do it all the time in Harlem.

38:15.025 --> 38:16.557
Wasn't sure about you, New York,

38:16.596 --> 38:17.933
but maybe I was wrong.

38:19.171 --> 38:22.502
We should ride together sometime.

38:22.565 --> 38:24.881
Mmm. If you can keep up.

38:33.395 --> 38:35.580
You know, you don't have to go.

38:35.775 --> 38:37.104
I don't think you want to explain me

38:37.174 --> 38:38.694
at breakfast to your parents.

38:39.509 --> 38:42.494
Anyway, I'm actually pretty glad
you left your window unlocked.

38:43.525 --> 38:44.815
Me, too.

39:17.935 --> 39:19.720
You didn't answer my calls!

39:19.775 --> 39:22.647
I got a lot more to deal
with in this world than just you.

39:22.695 --> 39:25.314
You got nothing more important
than looking after me and mine.

39:25.381 --> 39:27.194
My dealers are supposed
to be off limits.

39:27.248 --> 39:29.787
The chick had a jones
and was looking to score.

39:30.613 --> 39:32.242
You sure?

39:32.275 --> 39:35.056
'Cause my girl picked up
and left town ASAP like.

39:35.095 --> 39:36.689
Because she let a cop take her off

39:36.720 --> 39:38.194
and didn't want to face you.

39:38.283 --> 39:41.135
Just reign it in,
and give me what you owe me.

39:41.221 --> 39:42.600
I got men on corners
looking for products

39:42.670 --> 39:45.584
- and your last delivery was light.
- I'll make it up.

39:45.641 --> 39:47.037
But be clear on this,

39:47.076 --> 39:49.631
you don't give me orders.
I don't work for you!

39:49.721 --> 39:51.601
We're partners.

39:52.681 --> 39:54.720
You need to get
yourself a dictionary, friend,

39:54.779 --> 39:57.022
because this is not how this works.

39:57.100 --> 39:59.600
Not after the night you shot my boy!

39:59.601 --> 40:02.511

My father worked for Roxxon

41:07.673 --> 41:11.260
When he had an accident,
Roxxon paid my bills,

41:11.321 --> 41:12.634
put me through school,

41:12.721 --> 41:14.821
