WEBVTT

00:05.305 --> 00:07.939
Oh! Let me get that, husband.

00:09.175 --> 00:12.689
After a storybook wedding
and a magical honeymoon,

00:12.814 --> 00:15.090
Mitchell and I are finally newlyweds.

00:15.215 --> 00:17.212
Are you sure you wouldn't be more
comfortable in your own chair?

00:17.337 --> 00:20.162
There's no more
"my chair" or "your chair."

00:20.287 --> 00:20.816
So...

00:20.979 --> 00:23.399
We got back from our honeymoon
several weeks ago,

00:23.524 --> 00:25.583
- and it feels like it never...
- Never ended? Oh, my Gosh.

00:25.708 --> 00:28.015
It's like we have
one mind and one heart.

00:28.140 --> 00:29.877
And one chair.

00:31.406 --> 00:33.542
Happy three-month anniversary.

00:33.667 --> 00:35.511
Oh, is that today?

00:35.636 --> 00:38.414
So, listen, I have this boring
cocktail thing at the office,

00:38.539 --> 00:40.872
But I should be home by 6:00,
and then we can head to the party.

00:41.875 --> 00:44.522
For you, dad.
From dad. Again.

00:44.647 --> 00:47.075
Flowers? But you just
got me flowers yesterday.

00:47.200 --> 00:50.721
- Well, you also had cereal yesterday.
- And I wouldn't mind having some today.

00:50.884 --> 00:55.436
Sure was nice
when this house wasn't full of bees.

00:57.000 --> 01:03.074

01:08.193 --> 01:09.945
More syrup for milady?

01:10.111 --> 01:12.072
Why, thank you, kind sir.

01:12.238 --> 01:14.599
Claire, do we still have any of
those cookies that you and luke baked?

01:14.724 --> 01:18.040
Are we the kind of family
hat has cookies for breakfast?

01:18.471 --> 01:20.459
Yes, we are!

01:20.622 --> 01:22.514
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

01:24.918 --> 01:27.299
- A butterfly!
- Oh, my God!

01:27.462 --> 01:28.380
We are having...

01:28.546 --> 01:30.466
...the most perfect summer...

01:30.632 --> 01:31.467
...ever.

01:31.633 --> 01:34.220
Don't get me wrong,
the Dunphys have had some great days.

01:34.345 --> 01:36.156
We just have a little trouble
stringing them together.

01:36.281 --> 01:40.644
Our record was eight consecutive
blissful days, December 2007.

01:40.769 --> 01:41.975
It was our Hanukkah.

01:42.100 --> 01:44.556
This summer,
all the Dunphys are just clicking.

01:44.681 --> 01:46.881
Yeah, Haley and Luke
are getting along,

01:47.006 --> 01:48.962
Alex is off building houses
for the poor.

01:49.087 --> 01:52.199
Which I know sounds awful,
but she loves it.

01:52.362 --> 01:54.131
My fashion blog is blowing up.

01:54.256 --> 01:58.825
I started doing these live video chats,
and now I have over 50,000 subscribers!

01:58.950 --> 02:02.098
Oh, plus, my hair
has never looked better.

02:02.223 --> 02:05.454
I'm not a religious person...
But I just woke up.

02:06.626 --> 02:09.824
Phil has been gardening. I've had time
to catch up and read the classics.

02:09.949 --> 02:13.091
When she isn't busy helping me
with my magic-mirror disappearing trick.

02:13.216 --> 02:15.884
I'm just gonna say it.
Suddenly, I love magic.

02:16.009 --> 02:17.353
I don't care
if it's the middle of the day.

02:17.478 --> 02:20.477
I just want to put you in a box
and stick swords in you.

02:21.443 --> 02:24.982
If this summer wasn't magical enough,
I haven't had a single bad plum!

02:25.729 --> 02:27.609
Oh, my God!

02:27.772 --> 02:30.484
- So, the zipper...
- Oh, my God!

02:31.095 --> 02:33.623
Oh, my God!

02:47.853 --> 02:49.131
Manny!

02:49.294 --> 02:50.969
Manny!

02:51.094 --> 02:53.533
Come! Talk to your cousins!

02:53.658 --> 02:55.552
- <i>Hola!</i>
- <i>¿Cómo estás, Manny?</i>

02:55.677 --> 02:57.514
Manny, why you freeze the colombians?

02:57.677 --> 03:00.055
If I talk to one of them,
I have to talk to 50 of them.

03:00.221 --> 03:01.974
Just do it as a birthday gift.

03:02.140 --> 03:03.934
You always do this.
Your birthday's not till next week.

03:04.100 --> 03:07.757
Not mine. It's aunt Rosario's
82nd birthday today.

03:07.882 --> 03:10.213
That's why all the goats
are wearing the party hats.

03:10.338 --> 03:11.361
Look!

03:11.840 --> 03:14.823
- Manny!
- Hi, everyone.

03:16.779 --> 03:19.080
- Ay!
- Pretty snazzy new cheaters, huh?

03:19.205 --> 03:20.331
- Five bucks.
- Wow.

03:20.456 --> 03:21.580
I know, right?!

03:22.283 --> 03:25.672
My husband is an older man,
but he's not an old man.

03:25.797 --> 03:29.264
But with the track suit
and now the glasses,

03:29.389 --> 03:31.488
It's like he just stopped trying lately.

03:31.613 --> 03:33.646
Comfort is not everything.

03:34.787 --> 03:37.846
My toes have been numb
since my quinceanera.

03:38.009 --> 03:39.426
We don't have to be at drinks till 5:00,

03:39.551 --> 03:41.850
so I'm gonna run a few errands,
take these bad boys for a spin.

03:42.013 --> 03:45.142
Ay, Jay. Why don't you wear
that new outfit that I just got you?

03:45.308 --> 03:49.477
Uh, a little flashy, that extra zipper.
It's like a staircase to nowhere.

03:49.602 --> 03:53.389
- Yeah, but it makes you look very...
- Honey, I'm so sorry. Right on your toes.

03:53.514 --> 03:55.608
It's fine. You can drop
a pay phone on my foot.

03:55.733 --> 03:58.420
I don't feel a thing anymore.

04:01.324 --> 04:03.827
And now,
as my lovely assistant joins me,

04:03.993 --> 04:05.871
It's time to chant
the incantation that will send

04:06.037 --> 04:10.042
this fair maiden
into the sixth dimension.

04:10.208 --> 04:13.259
By the hat of Merlin,
by the witches of Gramanthia,

04:13.384 --> 04:16.325
we do make this offering
to you... be gone!

04:16.923 --> 04:18.470
Did I do it? Did I disappear?

04:19.463 --> 04:21.139
Almost. Just a little bit of forehead.

04:21.264 --> 04:23.225
- Oh, I can scrunch down.
- There's love.

04:23.388 --> 04:24.320
Hey, guys.

04:24.445 --> 04:26.183
Sweet!
You brought the sifter.

04:26.308 --> 04:28.772
- Aw!
- Now I can start my rhubarb pie.

04:28.935 --> 04:30.437
Oh, can I help pick the rhubarb?

04:30.603 --> 04:31.730
Lead the way, kitten.

04:32.223 --> 04:34.111
- Anybody want a plum?
- I'm good.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.693
I'll grab you a roadie.

04:36.859 --> 04:39.238
There is no easy way to ask this,
but are you all high?

04:39.404 --> 04:40.614
No, Mitchell. We're happy.

04:40.780 --> 04:42.366
Oh, I'm trying to get away from "happy."

04:42.532 --> 04:45.661
All right, in the briefest possible way,
why don't you let me know what's going on?

04:45.827 --> 04:47.621
Cam refuses to let the honeymoon end.

04:47.787 --> 04:50.465
I have a house full of flowers,
endless romantic texts.

04:50.590 --> 04:52.546
I know, I know,
I sound like an ungrateful jerk.

04:52.709 --> 04:54.484
- You do.
- It's exhausting.

04:54.609 --> 04:57.092
Not to mention
impossible to reciprocate.

04:57.255 --> 04:58.064
Oh, my God!

04:58.189 --> 05:00.718
Anyway, do you think that
maybe I should talk to him gently

05:00.843 --> 05:02.722
about taking it down a notch?

05:02.885 --> 05:04.430
No, absolutely not.
That never ends well.

05:04.596 --> 05:06.437
Clearly you thought this said "be mean."

05:06.562 --> 05:08.190
- Phil, honey, no.
- No.

05:08.315 --> 05:10.272
It's okay, don't worry, I...

05:10.435 --> 05:13.564
- And it wasn't even Valentine's Day.
- So your advice is to do nothing.

05:13.730 --> 05:16.153
Yes, Mitchell,
as horrible as this sounds,

05:16.278 --> 05:19.362
you need to suck it up
and let yourself be loved,

05:19.487 --> 05:22.532
and Cam will end up
dialing back the romance.

05:22.657 --> 05:24.953
You might just miss it.
I know I do.

05:25.116 --> 05:26.910
Here we are.
A plum for my peach.

05:28.786 --> 05:29.288
Do you?

05:30.705 --> 05:32.448
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

05:34.885 --> 05:36.549
- Is he okay?
- He's Mitchell.

05:36.674 --> 05:40.366
Look, I didn't even want to talk about it.
We've had such a great thing going on here.

05:40.491 --> 05:43.345
I don't want to let that kind
of negativity in the house.

05:43.845 --> 05:44.973
- Alex!
- Hey!

05:45.136 --> 05:47.347
We didn't think you were
coming back until next week.

05:47.513 --> 05:48.473
I got a ride home early.

05:48.598 --> 05:50.692
This has been the worst summer ever!

05:50.817 --> 05:53.563
- Careful, you idiot!
- You're an idiot!

05:59.100 --> 06:00.704
And last night, my tent ripped,

06:00.829 --> 06:03.403
so I had to sleep under a plywood
boardleaning up against a van.

06:03.528 --> 06:04.326
Pass me a napkin.

06:04.489 --> 06:07.326
- Is milady's arm broken?
- Yours is about to be.

06:07.492 --> 06:08.646
Aww, precious flowers.

06:08.771 --> 06:09.873
Not that I could sleep
with all the rats.

06:10.036 --> 06:12.877
And, by the way, if any of you
start coughing up blood, my bad.

06:13.002 --> 06:14.336
I think I brought back the plague.

06:14.499 --> 06:17.878
What am I doing? I think I left
my backpack in the driveway.

06:18.044 --> 06:21.123
- Stop kicking me!
- You're kicking me!

06:21.789 --> 06:24.178
I'm sorry. I'm just fidgety today.

06:24.303 --> 06:26.348
It's okay. A cookie might help.

06:26.511 --> 06:28.972
- Here's that napkin you wanted.
- I got the mail!

06:29.138 --> 06:31.570
Would it have killed you
to give me one without ketchup on it?

06:31.695 --> 06:33.647
- Move!
- You have room!

06:33.810 --> 06:35.312
No, move out! You're 40!

06:35.478 --> 06:36.690
Okay. That's enough.

06:36.815 --> 06:40.153
Luke, why don't you go water our garden.
Haley, just disappear for a minute.

06:40.316 --> 06:42.361
Well, it's not like
you could help with that.

06:42.527 --> 06:43.750
Abracad-ouch.

06:44.492 --> 06:47.494
- It's great having Alex home, huh?
- So great.

06:47.657 --> 06:51.321
- You don't think that she's the reason...
- No. No, I do not.

06:51.446 --> 06:54.213
We both knew that this charmed summer
Had to have a bump in it somewhere.

06:54.338 --> 06:55.898
Yes. Yeah.

06:56.023 --> 06:57.252
And it's not like Alex coming home

06:57.377 --> 07:01.148
could suddenly throw off
our whole happy mojo.

07:01.273 --> 07:04.302
- How's that plum?
- Great. Oh, my God.

07:05.758 --> 07:07.210
- There she is!
- There she is!

07:07.335 --> 07:08.723
Oh, so happy to have you home, honey.

07:08.886 --> 07:10.639
- Oh, my God! It's a bat!
- Aah!

07:10.805 --> 07:12.193
What's happening?!

07:12.318 --> 07:15.223
- Get it out of the house!
- Get it away!

07:18.730 --> 07:20.315
This is unbelievable.

07:20.481 --> 07:22.234
The dry cleaner lost
another one of my shirts.

07:22.400 --> 07:24.403
You know that nice,
red-white-and-blue Hawaiian one?

07:24.569 --> 07:26.238
Yes, that was a very nice one.

07:26.404 --> 07:28.075
That's the fourth
Hawaiian shirt he's lost.

07:28.200 --> 07:30.559
I'm telling you, this is
a "dateline" story waiting to happen.

07:30.825 --> 07:34.037
Great talking with you all.
Hey, but someone wants to say hi.

07:34.203 --> 07:35.014
No, no!

07:35.139 --> 07:36.876
- Jay!
- Hi, guys.

07:37.039 --> 07:38.875
- <i>¿Cómo estás?</i>
- Nope, still don't speak spanish.

07:39.041 --> 07:41.575
Always so much fun
seeing you guys, though.

07:41.700 --> 07:43.079
Listen, I...

07:43.204 --> 07:44.506
- Gloria?
- Hmm?

07:44.631 --> 07:47.304
Your cousin's wearing my black,
yellow, and peach Hawaiian shirt.

07:48.009 --> 07:49.529
Ay, please, Jay!

07:49.654 --> 07:52.559
Like you're the only man in this whole
wide world that owns that shirt.

07:52.722 --> 07:55.060
These designer specs
don't just make my eyes pop.

07:55.185 --> 07:57.772
I can see the cigar burn
I put on the left pocket.

07:58.679 --> 08:00.925
- It's a coincidence.
- There's a lot of those.

08:01.050 --> 08:02.675
Like according
to your Uncle's hoodie here,

08:02.800 --> 08:04.708
he was on my track team
at Buchanan High.

08:04.833 --> 08:06.114
Hey, guys. Tell you what.

08:06.277 --> 08:08.864
Why don't we sample some
American food for a change?

08:09.030 --> 08:11.825
So, you're sending
my clothes to Colombia?

08:12.530 --> 08:15.957
Just the old ones,
and they send most of them back.

08:16.120 --> 08:17.280
And there it is.

08:17.405 --> 08:19.169
Do you have a problem
with the way I dress?

08:19.332 --> 08:20.626
Jay, I love you very, very much.

08:20.792 --> 08:22.669
And I love you very much,
but that wasn't the question.

08:22.835 --> 08:24.960
It's just that sometimes I feel like

08:25.085 --> 08:27.927
you could make a bigger effort
on your appearance.

08:28.090 --> 08:28.884
And there it is.

08:29.050 --> 08:31.019
Please stop saying that.

08:31.144 --> 08:35.217
It's just that I feel that lately
you don't make an effort to look good for me,

08:35.342 --> 08:38.063
and I'm always making an effort
to look my best for you.

08:38.226 --> 08:40.354
- For me? Sure.
- What?

08:40.520 --> 08:43.065
Let's face it, you don't really
doll up for me. You do it for you.

08:43.231 --> 08:44.816
You get your hair done,
you get your nails done.

08:44.982 --> 08:47.903
Oh, so you wouldn't mind
if I stopped fixing myself up?

08:48.069 --> 08:50.072
No, because I love you for you.

08:50.238 --> 08:53.325
And since we're being honest,
I actually think sometimes...

08:53.491 --> 08:54.534
You overdo it.

08:54.700 --> 08:56.036
And there it is.

08:56.202 --> 08:58.021
- You're using it wrong.
- No, this is good.

08:58.146 --> 08:59.848
It's good to know that you don't care.

08:59.973 --> 09:02.709
This is gonna save me
so much time in the future.

09:02.875 --> 09:04.139
- Good.
- Good!

09:05.045 --> 09:06.835
Manny!

09:07.214 --> 09:08.049
Why?

09:10.234 --> 09:11.609
I don't care if it's cliché.

09:11.734 --> 09:13.679
I love the convenience
of a nice mini quiche.

09:13.845 --> 09:14.971
You got a little, um...

09:15.137 --> 09:16.864
Oh, no. Okay.

09:16.989 --> 09:19.016
Perfect. Can the new guy
embarrass himself any more?

09:19.141 --> 09:23.064
Hey, counselor. What do I have to do
to get you to drop that suit?

09:23.189 --> 09:26.108
- Cam, what are you doing here?
- Surprising my "hugsband"!

09:27.161 --> 09:30.076
- I'm hearing that term for the first time.
- Yeah.

09:32.639 --> 09:34.116
So when will you guys be back?

09:34.282 --> 09:36.493
Looks like somebody's
entertaining a lady friend.

09:36.659 --> 09:40.205
Maybe you'll pour her a nice,
tall glass of Manischewitz?

09:40.371 --> 09:42.789
You know what?
Sometimes just a straight answer.

09:42.914 --> 09:46.331
Gloria, can I get an E.T.A.?
These are important clients.

09:46.456 --> 09:48.494
I'd like them to still be alive
when we get there.

09:48.619 --> 09:50.156
Okay! I'm ready.

09:51.136 --> 09:52.801
- Seriously?
- What?

09:54.175 --> 09:56.012
Ay, no! I'm so sorry!

09:56.178 --> 09:59.099
I forgot this was drinks
with your clients.

09:59.224 --> 10:01.264
Hold on. Okay.

10:01.880 --> 10:03.437
I'm ready now. Let's go.

10:05.925 --> 10:07.808
Hey, there, superstar.

10:07.933 --> 10:09.414
- Moron!
- Derp!

10:09.539 --> 10:11.681
It really hasn't been
the same here without you.

10:12.334 --> 10:13.655
So what do you got there?

10:13.821 --> 10:15.365
Oh, college brochure!

10:15.531 --> 10:19.161
You're gonna have your pick of schools.
You're our little genius.

10:19.952 --> 10:22.791
- I just hope...
- What, Claire? What do you hope?

10:22.916 --> 10:26.481
Well, you have such a perfect record,
I hope they don't hold it against you

10:26.606 --> 10:28.892
- that this week you kinda...
- Well...

10:29.017 --> 10:31.417
- Don't want to say "quit."
- You just did.

10:31.542 --> 10:33.300
Are you trying to send me back
to that hellhole?

10:33.466 --> 10:35.494
No! It's... Honey,

10:35.619 --> 10:38.683
you're part of a team,
and there are people relying on you.

10:38.808 --> 10:41.099
So when you just
up and vanish like that,

10:41.265 --> 10:43.143
It sort of... it...

10:43.309 --> 10:44.169
Phil?

10:44.955 --> 10:45.850
Phil?!

10:46.896 --> 10:50.233
Your mom just feels like it's unlike you
to walk away from something.

10:50.399 --> 10:51.827
At least I could walk away.

10:51.952 --> 10:53.922
My tent-mate nail-gunned
her foot to the floor.

10:54.047 --> 10:57.655
She was just walking around in a circle
screaming until someone found her!

10:57.780 --> 10:59.367
Why do you guys want
to get rid of me so badly?

10:59.533 --> 11:01.819
- No one wants to get rid of you.
- It's just seven more days.

11:01.944 --> 11:03.698
You'll feel good about
finishing something you started,

11:03.823 --> 11:06.416
and then you join us for the perfect
little summer we're having here.

11:06.582 --> 11:09.252
- Were having until an hour ago.
- Haley!

11:09.418 --> 11:11.062
Oh, my God.
Okay, I see what this is.

11:11.187 --> 11:12.547
You all are happier when I'm not here.

11:12.713 --> 11:13.924
- No, that's not true.
- Save it!

11:14.090 --> 11:18.136
I'll get a ride back up there and you all
can continue to enjoy your perfect summer!

11:18.302 --> 11:20.412
- Alex, honey!
- Leave me alone!

11:22.039 --> 11:23.809
We just got free cinemax!

11:28.646 --> 11:30.607
Here's Mitchell kissing a dolphin.

11:31.132 --> 11:33.080
Oh, that's him kissing a tiger.

11:33.205 --> 11:34.927
I'm the tiger. Rawr!

11:36.269 --> 11:37.890
We have fun,
you know?

11:38.015 --> 11:40.422
Were we supposed to bring our spouses?

11:40.547 --> 11:41.922
Hey, Cam? Cam, hey, look.

11:42.047 --> 11:44.371
Um, this is kind of work-only.

11:44.537 --> 11:46.275
Oh, please.
They don't even know I'm here.

11:46.400 --> 11:47.624
I like this song. Let's dance.

11:47.790 --> 11:50.443
- No, no. Nobody's dancing.
- Shh. Say it with your hips.

11:51.088 --> 11:52.212
Okay.

11:52.378 --> 11:54.495
- Hey, uh, no, Cam. Um...
- Hmm?

11:54.620 --> 11:58.696
- You know I love you, right?
- First man that ever did love me right!

11:58.821 --> 12:00.948
- We have fun.
- We do, we do, we do.

12:01.073 --> 12:03.390
- So, look, I was thinking that maybe...
- Mmm.

12:03.515 --> 12:06.685
We could turn the romance down
just a little bit, you know?

12:06.995 --> 12:09.186
Because it's been getting
a little bit...

12:09.311 --> 12:11.932
I don't want to say over the top,
but it...

12:12.057 --> 12:14.568
Cam, I'm gonna need your help
if we're gonna keep dancing here.

12:14.734 --> 12:16.433
I feel like you're mad.

12:19.581 --> 12:22.339
- So, we had an informal vote over there...
- We're not dancing anymore.

12:22.464 --> 12:23.888
- Oh, good.
- Yeah.

12:26.419 --> 12:28.497
You know Herb might stop by, right?

12:28.622 --> 12:30.842
He takes the pictures
for the company newsletter.

12:30.967 --> 12:32.753
Yes, I love "Herb's blurbs."

12:33.953 --> 12:35.046
Well...

12:35.171 --> 12:37.340
Here come the doors!

12:38.013 --> 12:40.510
Usually all the good places have them!

12:40.676 --> 12:42.345
I'm going to open them!

12:42.511 --> 12:43.972
You're such a gentleman, Jay.

12:46.138 --> 12:47.392
I think I forgot my wallet.

12:47.558 --> 12:48.943
Oh, don't worry.

12:49.068 --> 12:51.897
I have some money
here in my fanny pack, huh?

12:52.063 --> 12:54.439
For God's sake, fine. You win.

12:54.564 --> 12:56.610
I like it when you make yourself pretty.

12:56.776 --> 12:58.945
- I win!
- I just said you won.

12:59.111 --> 13:00.758
Ay, Jay, what you're feeling right now

13:00.883 --> 13:03.298
is what I feel when you stop
trying to look good for me.

13:03.423 --> 13:04.653
No, I get it.

13:04.778 --> 13:07.412
- Then why did you stop trying?
- Because...

13:09.705 --> 13:11.875
Oh, forget it. It's too stupid.

13:12.041 --> 13:13.043
Tell me.

13:14.071 --> 13:17.390
A couple of months ago,
I was shopping at Barneys...

13:17.515 --> 13:19.044
You know I like to stay current.

13:19.169 --> 13:21.427
Anyhow, I'm coming
out of the dressing room,

13:21.552 --> 13:24.512
and I see these two young guys
laughing at me,

13:24.678 --> 13:27.032
You know, like
"there's the old guy trying too hard."

13:27.157 --> 13:28.350
You know, of course I get mad.

13:28.516 --> 13:32.228
But I start thinking, "they're right,
Jay. You're old. Just be old."

13:32.812 --> 13:35.102
- Ow!
- Listen to me, Jay Pritchett!

13:35.227 --> 13:37.671
A lot of people assume that I married you
because of your money,

13:37.796 --> 13:39.486
and that's only a very,
very small part of it.

13:39.652 --> 13:40.862
I'd like to go back to that.

13:41.028 --> 13:43.138
I married you
because you were sexy.

13:43.263 --> 13:44.408
You still are.

13:44.533 --> 13:48.161
Who knows for how long
that's gonna last, for either of us.

13:48.327 --> 13:51.573
So we have to keep making
an effort for each other.

13:51.698 --> 13:53.907
Next time you go to Barneys,
I go with you.

13:54.032 --> 13:56.294
Maybe you're just making
the wrong choices.

13:57.318 --> 13:58.546
Not always.

14:01.298 --> 14:03.551
You want to have a drink?
I can change.

14:04.946 --> 14:07.155
No, I think I'll text them,
tell them I was sick.

14:07.280 --> 14:09.099
Let's go home.
You said I was sexy.

14:11.715 --> 14:13.395
Okay, bye, Rosa. Thank you.

14:13.561 --> 14:14.270
Cam!

14:14.436 --> 14:15.730
What's up, dude?

14:15.896 --> 14:16.898
Seriously?

14:17.064 --> 14:18.704
What, is that too romantic for you?

14:18.829 --> 14:19.983
He loves me not...

14:20.108 --> 14:21.217
He loves me not...

14:21.342 --> 14:22.612
He loves me not.

14:22.778 --> 14:26.039
- Okay, can we talk?
- Actually, no. I'm kind of busy.

14:26.164 --> 14:28.748
I'm assuming you forgot
it's our three month-iversary.

14:28.873 --> 14:33.102
Well, I foolishly set up a celebration
that I will kindly get rid of.

14:33.227 --> 14:34.249
Cam!

14:34.989 --> 14:38.336
No, I didn't forget, but that's
what I want to talk to you about.

14:38.502 --> 14:39.832
You've been a little bit...

14:39.957 --> 14:41.589
See, look.
This is what I'm talking about.

14:41.714 --> 14:43.341
- You got me another present.
- Don't touch that.

14:45.259 --> 14:46.636
Oh, my... my heart!

14:46.802 --> 14:47.821
What heart?

14:48.971 --> 14:51.224
Cam! Come on!

14:51.390 --> 14:54.216
Okay, listen.
I know how lucky I am to have you,

14:54.341 --> 14:57.607
but I can't possibly keep up
with this level of affection...

14:58.731 --> 15:01.890
- Oh, boy.
- I apologize! I'm a monster!

15:02.015 --> 15:04.237
No, obviously, I'm the monster.

15:04.403 --> 15:05.421
Obviously.

15:06.373 --> 15:08.880
You know, can I just point out
that when we were in Cabo,

15:09.005 --> 15:11.745
you didn't seem to mind
all the flowers...

15:11.911 --> 15:13.776
- Yeah, but...
- ...or the back rubs.

15:13.901 --> 15:15.479
...or the attention.

15:15.604 --> 15:16.875
Well, that was our honeymoon,

15:17.041 --> 15:19.817
and, yes, I loved it,
but it was weeks ago.

15:19.942 --> 15:23.715
Well, maybe some of us
don't want it to... end!

15:23.881 --> 15:26.424
Well, it has to eventually end.

15:26.935 --> 15:28.338
All right, Cam...

15:29.327 --> 15:31.222
Did you have this lipstick or...

15:31.388 --> 15:35.009
You know, personally, I feel sorry
for you that you're so shut off

15:35.134 --> 15:39.322
- that a few simple romantic gestures...
- Oh, my God! What am I looking at here?

15:39.447 --> 15:42.870
Well, I guess I'm crazy because
I've taken pictures of you sleeping

15:42.995 --> 15:46.237
every night since we got married
because you're the man of my dreams.

15:46.403 --> 15:49.824
If I was the man of your dreams,
wouldn't you have to be the one sleeping?

15:49.990 --> 15:50.950
Don't pull that thread, Mitchell.

15:51.482 --> 15:54.037
- Speaking of which, what is this?
- Don't pull that thread, Mitchell.

15:54.203 --> 15:56.159
Oh, Cam, come on!

15:56.284 --> 15:58.041
Even you have to admit
this is excessive.

15:58.207 --> 15:59.501
Excessive? Really?

15:59.667 --> 16:00.422
[ pop ]
oh!

16:00.547 --> 16:03.569
- Struck by Cupid's magic arrow.
- It's off, Lily.

16:03.694 --> 16:06.508
Seriously? Two hours
rehearsing with rosa?

16:06.974 --> 16:09.052
Cam, what is going on with you?

16:09.745 --> 16:12.309
We just had the most romantic year ever,

16:12.434 --> 16:15.517
planning our ceremony,
the wedding, the honeymoon,

16:15.683 --> 16:18.978
And I'm just worried if we let this go,
we'll never get it back.

16:19.144 --> 16:22.168
- That doesn't all just end.
- It did once.

16:22.293 --> 16:24.224
You know, the first two years
we were together,

16:24.349 --> 16:26.321
we were insanely romantic.

16:26.446 --> 16:29.454
Then it became
about parenting and working.

16:29.579 --> 16:32.160
And this last year, we got that back,

16:32.285 --> 16:34.953
and I just realized
I've dropped the ball.

16:35.119 --> 16:35.823
Oh, no.

16:35.948 --> 16:39.410
Well, maybe you shouldn't be
the only one carrying the ball.

16:39.535 --> 16:42.085
- What if you did a give-off to me?
- A hand-off.

16:42.251 --> 16:44.963
Okay, what... yeah.
Look, what if I...

16:45.129 --> 16:47.757
Tried to become
a little bit more romantic?

16:47.923 --> 16:49.676
What would that even look like?

16:52.627 --> 16:56.474
This song was playing the night
I asked you to move in.

16:56.982 --> 16:58.309
At that applebee's.

16:59.768 --> 17:02.166
- I believe you owe me a dance.
- Yes.

17:09.440 --> 17:11.739
Are we almost done
with fairy time?

17:11.905 --> 17:13.199
- Lily, of all...
-Lily, that's offensive.

17:13.365 --> 17:14.784
I just want to get out of this costume.

17:14.950 --> 17:16.085
- Oh.
- Oh, of course.

17:16.210 --> 17:17.244
Now, that does
look uncomfortable.

17:17.411 --> 17:19.539
- They snap off.
- They snap off. Oh, that's easy.

17:19.704 --> 17:21.219
My ride's on its way.

17:21.344 --> 17:22.876
Don't worry,
I'll wait outside on the curb.

17:23.041 --> 17:24.154
Honey, nobody wants you to go.

17:24.279 --> 17:26.671
Yeah, even if you are bad luck,
you're our bad luck.

17:26.837 --> 17:28.923
You realize that is
in no way an apology, right?

17:29.089 --> 17:30.534
- The thing is that we are really...
- Please stop talking.

17:30.659 --> 17:32.650
I spent this entire summer
as an outsider.

17:32.775 --> 17:35.471
They literally made me build
the outside of the house.

17:35.637 --> 17:37.646
And then I come back here and I...

17:38.311 --> 17:40.980
Why is your webcam on?
Are you trying to humiliate me?

17:41.105 --> 17:42.520
That light means it's on?

17:42.686 --> 17:45.148
It doesn't automatically turn off
when you go to a different web page?

17:45.314 --> 17:48.651
No, and considering
you keep your laptop on your bed,

17:48.817 --> 17:50.984
Right by where you change,
and when you come out of the shower,

17:51.109 --> 17:52.113
And who knows
what else...

17:52.279 --> 17:53.658
Everyone knows what else!

17:53.783 --> 17:55.732
It's probably why
you have 50,000 subscribers.

17:55.857 --> 17:58.578
Hey! You should be ashamed
of yourselves!

18:00.486 --> 18:01.623
Yeah, yeah. Still not off.

18:01.789 --> 18:03.124
How do you do that?

18:03.290 --> 18:04.918
Wait, what is that smell?

18:05.084 --> 18:07.480
Your father and Luke
are making a rhubarb pie

18:07.605 --> 18:09.564
from rhubarb we grew
in our own garden.

18:09.689 --> 18:10.548
You're not leaving until you try it.

18:10.714 --> 18:11.966
No, no, no, no, no.
I smell smoke.

18:12.132 --> 18:14.468
Well, I didn't turn
the oven on yet, did you?

18:14.593 --> 18:15.261
No.

18:15.386 --> 18:16.098
Oh, no, no!

18:16.223 --> 18:18.514
I tried to start that stupid
"war and peace" again last night

18:18.680 --> 18:20.244
in the bathtub,
but then I fell asleep.

18:20.369 --> 18:22.268
It dropped in the water
and I thought I would just dry it out.

18:23.135 --> 18:24.346
Take cover!

18:24.471 --> 18:25.713
- Okay! Okay!
- Take cover!

18:25.838 --> 18:26.898
Oh, God!

18:27.064 --> 18:28.125
Damn this thing!

18:28.250 --> 18:31.236
Did nobody notice the oven light?!
Lights mean things, people!

18:31.921 --> 18:32.862
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Oh! Oh! Oh!

18:33.028 --> 18:33.957
Great job!

18:34.082 --> 18:35.711
Oh, god! Oh, no!
No! No!

18:35.836 --> 18:36.908
Good job, honey!

18:38.700 --> 18:40.599
This has been awesome,
but my ride's here.

18:40.724 --> 18:42.597
- Have a magical day.
- No, no, no, no.

18:42.722 --> 18:44.176
- No, sweetie.
- Claire, I got this.

18:44.301 --> 18:45.494
- Spoon time, people.
- Yes!

18:45.619 --> 18:47.585
- Family tradition.
- Yes.

18:47.751 --> 18:49.261
You can leave if you want to,
sweetheart,

18:49.386 --> 18:52.249
but we're not letting you go
without a smile on your face.

18:52.374 --> 18:54.482
Luke and I poured
a lot of love into this pie,

18:54.607 --> 18:55.619
So, here...

18:56.103 --> 18:57.303
Taste this.

18:58.004 --> 18:59.097
Taste our love.

18:59.263 --> 19:01.438
You took the leaves
off the rhubarb, right?

19:01.869 --> 19:03.873
They're incredibly poisonous.
You all could die.

19:03.998 --> 19:05.882
No! Alex says
they're poison!

19:06.007 --> 19:08.231
Oh! Okay.

19:08.356 --> 19:10.125
We're right here! We heard her!

19:10.250 --> 19:11.192
You can't leave us.

19:11.358 --> 19:13.069
We're a danger
to ourselves.

19:13.235 --> 19:16.501
We're a family of fire starters,
poison eaters, and online prostitutes.

19:16.626 --> 19:19.659
It wasn't a perfect summer.
It was a stupid summer.

19:19.825 --> 19:23.742
Without you here to shame me,
I watched every "Real Housewives" episode

19:23.867 --> 19:26.833
and I only got to page two
in "War and Peace."

19:26.999 --> 19:30.443
- Please stay.
- We nee one adult in this household.

19:30.568 --> 19:32.015
Okay, fine.

19:34.006 --> 19:35.547
You know the attic window
is open, right?

19:35.672 --> 19:37.218
We really didn't.

19:39.297 --> 19:40.853
I race you up the stairs.

19:40.978 --> 19:42.901
Why don't you slip into
something less comfortable?

19:43.026 --> 19:44.121
Okay!

19:44.246 --> 19:45.727
Surprise!

19:45.893 --> 19:47.520
Ahhhhhh!

19:47.686 --> 19:50.106
Just a thought...
Maybe we should stop doing these.

19:50.272 --> 19:52.331
- What's going on?
- It seems pretty obvious.

19:52.456 --> 19:54.862
I had to throw the party a week early
to really surprise her.

19:54.987 --> 19:58.156
Should we be concerned about her?
That's similar to the way mom left.

19:58.322 --> 20:01.108
Gloria and I got in this whole thing
about how we dress.

20:01.233 --> 20:04.289
Long story, I think she might
need a little more time bef...

20:04.414 --> 20:06.122
<i>Hola!</i>

20:08.739 --> 20:10.335
I had this outfit underneath.

20:10.460 --> 20:13.398
Did you really think that I was gonna
walk into a bar looking like that?

20:13.991 --> 20:15.173
<i>Gracias!</i>

20:16.340 --> 20:19.510
All these years, you're telling me
you can get ready that fast?

20:56.341 --> 20:58.107
Oh, my God!

20:59.305 --> 21:05.919
