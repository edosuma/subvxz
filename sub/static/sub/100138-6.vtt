26:38.440 --> 26:39.999

...because it wouldn't have been good
for either of us.

about what was best,

26:48.320 --> 26:51.676

They were about to cut Pan from me.

27:21.760 --> 27:23.239

30:08.120 --> 30:10.191
Well, I could take you back to your dorm.

30:14.000 --> 30:15.673
You could stay here.

30:15.800 --> 30:17.313
I'd like that.

30:17.440 --> 30:18.635
You would?

30:19.880 --> 30:20.995
Lyra...

30:22.120 --> 30:26.079
...I can't tell you how happy I am
to have found you again.

30:27.440 --> 30:30.353
And I can't tell you how happy I am
to be found.

30:32.640 --> 30:34.950

the master of Jordan College

30:35.080 --> 30:37.151

30:40.560 --> 30:42.836

30:44.640 --> 30:48.679
The trouble is, I believe
the only reason he gave it to you

30:48.800 --> 30:52.350
was because he wanted it to fall
into Lord Asriel's hands.

30:53.800 --> 30:55.791
And if there's one thing
that man doesn't need,

30:55.920 --> 30:58.230
it's more toys to do damage with.

not to tell me about it.

we expect going forward

There may be fighting,
but you've fought before.

44:55.240 --> 44:56.799

44:56.920 --> 44:59.070
But as the situation

44:59.200 --> 45:03.273
so my situation grows
more...complicated.

to be important -

45:06.280 --> 45:09.079

45:11.680 --> 45:13.830
She matters more than
she can ever know.

45:13.960 --> 45:17.715
The fate of more than this world
depends on her.

45:19.120 --> 45:21.111
Well, I had a contract
with the Gyptians

45:21.240 --> 45:23.595
over what was accomplished
in Bolvangar.

45:23.720 --> 45:27.190
This... This seems like
a whole new thing,

45:27.320 --> 45:30.073
which requires, if I'm honest,
new contracts and new payments...

45:30.200 --> 45:31.918
She will need you, Lee.

45:32.040 --> 45:35.954
You know, a man should have a choice
whether to take up arms or not.

45:36.080 --> 45:37.957
And you need her.

45:39.200 --> 45:41.111
That's not how I expected
this conversation to go.

45:41.240 --> 45:42.389
Is it not?

45:42.520 --> 45:45.114
No, I was hoping you would find a way of
chucking me some danger money.

45:45.240 --> 45:47.151
Instead, you blindsided me with...

45:48.240 --> 45:49.230
...love.

45:52.880 --> 45:53.995
Good.

for the fate of everything,

46:03.520 --> 46:04.794
and I'm responsible...

46:05.880 --> 46:07.075

We'll return them to their parents.

may be frightened

Those that they don't take back
will come join us as Gyptians.

You did well.

47:40.200 --> 47:41.713
Well?

We all fought them, at least.

We did better than fight them.
We defeated them.
