#Men.#

00:02.533 --> 00:04.066
Morning.

00:04.066 --> 00:05.200
Oh, morning.

00:05.200 --> 00:06.533
What you doing?

00:06.533 --> 00:09.266
Saving a little money,
so Jake is brown-baggin' it.

00:11.467 --> 00:13.667
Oh, who am I kidding?

00:21.200 --> 00:24.400
Breakfast of champions.

00:25.500 --> 00:28.233
Type Two Diabetes Division.

00:29.633 --> 00:31.166
Charlie's still in bed?

00:31.166 --> 00:32.433
Uh-huh.

00:32.433 --> 00:33.600
Ow.

00:33.600 --> 00:34.767
You all right?

00:34.767 --> 00:36.400
Yeah, just a little back pain.

00:36.400 --> 00:38.633
Oh, no. Uh, would you like me
to take a look?

00:38.633 --> 00:39.767
Oh, it's okay.

00:39.767 --> 00:41.033
Chelsea, I'm a chiropractor.

00:41.033 --> 00:42.467
This is what I do.

00:42.467 --> 00:44.100
Besides, you're like
family now,

00:44.100 --> 00:46.633
which entitles you to my family
and friends discount.

00:46.633 --> 00:47.800
All right.

00:47.800 --> 00:50.266
You'll actually be
the first one to use it.

00:50.266 --> 00:52.567
Now, I trust your
insurance is up-to-date.

00:52.567 --> 00:55.100
Yeah, but I don't think
it coverchiropractic.

00:55.100 --> 00:56.266
Oh, of course not.

00:56.266 --> 00:57.467
Big insurance will pay

00:57.467 --> 00:59.467
for an 80-year-old
man to get a boner,

00:59.467 --> 01:01.767
but God forbid his
spine is erect.

01:04.500 --> 01:06.900
Now, low long have you been
dealing with this pain?

01:06.900 --> 01:08.633
On and off since
I'm a teenager.

01:08.633 --> 01:11.767
Aha, so, would this be around
the time you started to develop?

01:11.767 --> 01:13.133
What do you mean?

01:13.133 --> 01:16.734
Well, you know,
as a woman.

01:16.734 --> 01:18.734
Boobies.

01:18.734 --> 01:20.300
Oh, uh, yeah.

01:20.300 --> 01:21.400
Ah.

01:21.400 --> 01:22.967
I've always known
that's a factor,

01:22.967 --> 01:24.533
but what are you gonna do?

01:24.533 --> 01:27.467
Well, I would recommend that
you get two adjustments a week

01:27.467 --> 01:29.600
and ultrasound
massage therapy.

01:29.600 --> 01:31.800
Plus, we'll work on
strengthening your upper traps

01:31.800 --> 01:34.767
and rhomboids so they can
support the load on your pecs.

01:34.767 --> 01:36.467
Or, in layman's terms,

01:36.467 --> 01:39.200
reinforce the door
that holds up the knockers.

01:41.133 --> 01:42.667
You're staring at them, Alan.

01:42.667 --> 01:45.900
It's okay.
I'm almost a doctor.

01:45.900 --> 01:47.867
Anyway, I've tried all that.

01:47.867 --> 01:49.333
It didn't help.

01:49.333 --> 01:52.700
Well, there is one other option,
but it's kind of a last resort.

01:52.700 --> 01:55.867
What's that?
Have you considered having
breast reduction surgery?

01:57.867 --> 02:00.367
Something's wrong.

02:00.367 --> 02:03.233
# Men, men, men, men, manly men,
men, men #

02:03.233 --> 02:06.467
# Men, men, men, men,
manly men, men, men #
# Ooh #

02:06.467 --> 02:09.633
# Men, men, men, men,

# Ooh #
# Ooh #

02:09.633 --> 02:11.767
# Ooh-ooh-ooh,
ooh-ohh, ooh-ooh... #

02:11.767 --> 02:14.266
# Men, men, men, men, manly men,

02:14.266 --> 02:17.300
# Ooh #
# Men, men, men, men, manly men,

02:17.300 --> 02:19.767
# Ah. #
# Men. #
# Men. #

02:26.533 --> 02:28.133
#Men.#

02:28.133 --> 02:31.033
You see, they reshape the whole
breast so you can't even tell.

02:31.033 --> 02:32.567
How long does it take to heal?

02:32.567 --> 02:34.166
Well, it says
just a few weeks.

02:34.166 --> 02:36.834
You can keep Charlie off
'em for that long, can't you?

02:36.834 --> 02:38.033
I don't know.

02:38.033 --> 02:40.500
Might have
to get some loaners.

02:40.500 --> 02:41.767
Morning.

02:41.767 --> 02:43.133
Morning.
Morning.

02:43.133 --> 02:45.100
Oh, that is not good porn.

02:46.533 --> 02:48.867
It's not porn.

02:48.867 --> 02:51.166
It's a Web site about
breast reduction surgery.

02:51.166 --> 02:53.867
Oh, Alan,
you don't need surgery.

02:55.133 --> 02:58.066
A little exercise'll firm up
those man boobs.

02:58.066 --> 02:59.400
Don't be silly, Charlie.

02:59.400 --> 03:02.367
Alan suggested it might be
a solution for my back pain.

03:02.367 --> 03:04.300
Really?

03:04.300 --> 03:06.600
Alan made that suggestion?

03:06.600 --> 03:08.734
I just said
it could help.

03:08.734 --> 03:10.300
I'll tell you what helps pain.

03:10.300 --> 03:11.767
Pain pills.

03:12.767 --> 03:14.633
In fact, I saw a guy on the news

03:14.633 --> 03:15.867
with a nail in his head,

03:15.867 --> 03:17.867
and thanks to pain pills,
he was laughing.

03:19.867 --> 03:21.533
What about addiction?

03:21.533 --> 03:22.967
That's the least
of his problems.

03:22.967 --> 03:24.767
He's got a nail
in his head.

03:24.767 --> 03:27.333
Charlie.
Kidding. Kidding.

03:27.333 --> 03:29.600
Look, I love your breasts
just the way they are,

03:29.600 --> 03:31.734
but if you're in pain, you have
my unconditional support

03:31.734 --> 03:34.033
to do whatever you have to do
to feel better.

03:34.033 --> 03:36.233
Really?

03:36.233 --> 03:38.033
So you'd be okay with this?

03:38.033 --> 03:40.066
Sweetie, come on.

03:40.066 --> 03:41.433
I'm sure if you knew

03:41.433 --> 03:44.333
that the weight of my penis
was causing me back problems,

03:44.333 --> 03:47.333
you'd be okay with me
shaving off a few inches, right?

03:47.333 --> 03:50.500
I suppose.

03:50.500 --> 03:52.633
Of course, I've learned
to deal with that pain,

03:52.633 --> 03:53.767
but that's my choice.

03:53.767 --> 03:56.767
Well, thank you for
being so understanding.

03:56.767 --> 03:58.567
You don't have to thank me.
I love you.

03:58.567 --> 03:59.567
I love you too.

03:59.567 --> 04:02.100
I'm gonna go get
ready for work.

04:02.100 --> 04:03.967
I'll be up in a minute.

04:05.367 --> 04:07.533
Charlie, I gotta say,
I think you handled
that really...

04:07.533 --> 04:09.633
(shrieking)

04:16.399 --> 04:19.632
Are you out
of your freakin' mind?

04:19.632 --> 04:20.899
My fingers!

04:20.899 --> 04:22.400
What are you doing
sticking your nose

04:22.400 --> 04:23.834
in my fiancÃ©e's breasts?

04:23.834 --> 04:25.266
I was just trying to help.

04:25.266 --> 04:27.500
Let's make one thing clear:
the only acceptable

04:27.500 --> 04:30.200
boob reduction in this house
is you moving out.

04:31.767 --> 04:34.100
Funny.
Please, Charlie...

04:34.100 --> 04:35.934
I make my living
with my hands.

04:35.934 --> 04:38.333
Really? Somebody's paying you
to masturbate?

04:38.333 --> 04:40.433
(chuckling)

04:45.600 --> 04:47.600
Also funny.

04:47.600 --> 04:49.266
Don't I wish.

04:49.266 --> 04:51.033
Now, please stop now.

04:51.033 --> 04:52.700
I am duly chastised.

04:52.700 --> 04:54.767
Not good enough.

04:56.367 --> 04:57.633
You need to be punished.

04:57.633 --> 04:58.633
What?!

04:58.633 --> 04:59.900
I'm giving you a time out.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.800
What are you talking about?

05:01.800 --> 05:03.000
You've been very bad

05:03.000 --> 05:04.567
and you need to think
about what you've done.

05:04.567 --> 05:07.233
Okay, fine.
You want me to go to my room?

05:07.233 --> 05:08.567
Not far enough.
Movies?

05:08.567 --> 05:09.700
Not long enough.

05:09.700 --> 05:10.734
What do you want me to do?

05:10.734 --> 05:12.166
I can't afford to stay
in a hotel.

05:12.166 --> 05:15.166
Here.

05:15.166 --> 05:17.900
That's enough for two
nights in a nice hotel

05:17.900 --> 05:20.233
or two months
in an airport locker.

05:21.133 --> 05:22.166
I don't want your money.

05:22.166 --> 05:24.867
Fine.
Go sleep in your car.

05:24.867 --> 05:26.800
Hold on.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.300
I'll just take a couple of bucks
for gas, that's it.

05:36.900 --> 05:38.767
And meals.
I have to eat.

05:43.934 --> 05:46.400
Tips and incidentals.

05:48.834 --> 05:51.100
#Men.#

05:53.734 --> 05:55.000
That feel good?

05:55.000 --> 05:56.133
(moans softly)

05:56.133 --> 05:58.200
Flavored oils.

05:58.200 --> 06:00.734
This one's...

06:00.734 --> 06:02.433
apple cinnamon.

06:02.433 --> 06:03.934
Nice.

06:03.934 --> 06:05.033
Want a lick?

06:05.033 --> 06:06.367
No, thanks.

06:06.367 --> 06:07.633
You sure?

06:07.633 --> 06:09.800
Tastes kind of like oily pie.

06:10.900 --> 06:12.467
I'll pass.

06:12.467 --> 06:14.667
Okay, more for me.

06:15.800 --> 06:17.266
You know, I appreciate this,

06:17.266 --> 06:19.700
but I don't think it's going
to solve my back problems.

06:19.700 --> 06:21.834
Well, not right away.

06:21.834 --> 06:23.667
But if we do this
enough, who knows?

06:23.667 --> 06:26.533
You might feel so much better,
you'll want bigger boobs.

06:27.367 --> 06:28.967
I don't think so, Charlie.

06:28.967 --> 06:30.133
Fair enough.

06:30.133 --> 06:31.867
I want 'em bigger,
you want 'em smaller.

06:31.867 --> 06:34.500
So we'll compromise and leave
them just the way they are.

06:34.500 --> 06:38.667
God, I love that we can
talk these things out.

06:38.667 --> 06:40.700
I made an appointment
for a consultation

06:40.700 --> 06:41.900
with a plastic surgeon.

06:41.900 --> 06:43.300
What?

06:43.300 --> 06:45.900
The more I think about it,
the more I think Alan's right.

06:45.900 --> 06:48.200
No-no-no, no, no.
Alan's never right.

06:48.200 --> 06:49.633
Ask anybody.

06:49.633 --> 06:52.400
He's like an idiot savant
without the savant part.

06:52.400 --> 06:54.266
I'm hoping you'll come
with me for support.

06:54.266 --> 06:57.066
Hey, you can always
count on me for support.

06:57.066 --> 07:00.133
I love you for who you are,
not the size of your breasts.

07:00.133 --> 07:02.066
Thank you.

07:02.066 --> 07:05.433
Of course it goes
both ways, you know.

07:05.433 --> 07:08.700
One of these days
I'm gonna need you to
love me for who I am,

07:08.700 --> 07:10.934
despite my old man balls.

07:10.934 --> 07:12.934
"Old man balls"?

07:12.934 --> 07:15.433
They get long, baby.

07:16.700 --> 07:19.033
Hey, don't throw away
your D-cup bras.

07:19.033 --> 07:20.967
We may be able
to re-purpose them.

07:31.700 --> 07:33.934
EVELYN (over intercom):
Hello?

07:35.233 --> 07:36.934
Hi, Mom.

07:36.934 --> 07:38.867
Oh, Alan. To what do I owe

07:38.867 --> 07:41.233
this unannounced
and inconvenient pleasure?

07:41.233 --> 07:44.300
Uh, just hoping
to ask for a favor.

07:44.300 --> 07:45.800
I see.

07:48.367 --> 07:49.667
Please tell me that there's

07:49.667 --> 07:52.467
a severed head in that bag
and you want me to hide it.

07:52.467 --> 07:55.066
Nope, just socks
and underwear.

07:55.066 --> 07:57.266
How many pair?

07:58.767 --> 08:00.633
Come on, Mom,
don't make me beg.

08:00.633 --> 08:02.367
(sighs):
All right.

08:02.367 --> 08:04.400
You know where
the guest room is.
(lock clicks, buzzes)

08:04.400 --> 08:06.800
Thank you.

08:06.800 --> 08:08.667
Uh, oh, uh, I hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

08:08.667 --> 08:10.967
Not unless you want to talk
to my gentleman friend.

08:10.967 --> 08:15.367
I was joking, Edgar.
Don't stop.

08:15.367 --> 08:17.233
Good night, Alan.

08:18.367 --> 08:19.734
Night, Mom.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.500
Lord...

08:42.500 --> 08:44.500
you've blessed me
with a lot:

08:44.500 --> 08:46.734
more money than I know
what to do with,

08:46.734 --> 08:48.033
a beautiful home,

08:48.033 --> 08:50.266
and a surprisingly
resilient liver.

08:51.367 --> 08:55.433
You have truly given unto me
with both hands.

08:56.433 --> 08:58.967
Which brings me to my request.

09:01.300 --> 09:03.467
Of all the gifts
you've bestowed upon me,

09:03.467 --> 09:05.934
none are a greater testament
to your glory

09:05.934 --> 09:08.767
than Chelsea's heavenly breasts.

09:08.767 --> 09:11.266
I don't know why you couldn't
have thrown in a sturdy spine

09:11.266 --> 09:12.734
so she could tote
those things around,

09:12.734 --> 09:16.467
but who am I
to question your methods?

09:16.467 --> 09:18.667
Anyway, you probably know
that she's thinking about

09:18.667 --> 09:21.367
tampering with your great work,
and I was just

09:21.367 --> 09:24.433
hoping that you could,
you know, talk to her,

09:24.433 --> 09:27.300
return her to the path
of righteousness...

09:27.300 --> 09:29.500
and bodaciousness.

09:30.533 --> 09:32.633
Amen.

09:33.967 --> 09:35.400
Oh, one more thing.

09:35.400 --> 09:38.033
I'm sorry we haven't
talked recently, but I had

09:38.033 --> 09:41.600
a little crisis of faith
after last year's Super Bowl.

09:41.600 --> 09:43.066
Water under the bridge.

09:43.066 --> 09:44.934
I got healthy
on the NBA Finals.

09:45.700 --> 09:49.433
Nice work with Kobe,
by the way.

10:21.900 --> 10:23.900
Oh, he didn't stay tonight.

10:23.900 --> 10:25.900
Kind of a booty call.

10:25.900 --> 10:29.400
More like a dine and dash.

10:33.667 --> 10:35.834
What'd you do to piss
your brother off this time?

10:35.834 --> 10:37.800
Nothing. I-I just suggested

10:37.800 --> 10:39.333
that Chelsea's back pain
might benefit

10:39.333 --> 10:40.767
from breast reduction surgery.

10:41.633 --> 10:43.133
You suggested

10:43.133 --> 10:46.400
that Charlie's fiancÃ©e
get smaller breasts?

10:46.400 --> 10:47.600
Yeah.

10:47.600 --> 10:48.800
While you're at it,

10:48.800 --> 10:51.000
why not try and reinstate
Prohibition?

10:52.767 --> 10:54.467
Well, anyway, Charlie
and I have decided

10:54.467 --> 10:55.934
to take a little break
from each other,

10:55.934 --> 10:57.834
so I'll only be here
a couple of days.

10:57.834 --> 10:59.667
Oh, Alan.

10:59.667 --> 11:01.700
I know I'm a little old
to run home to mom.

11:01.700 --> 11:03.533
Believe me, if I had money
for a hotel,

11:03.533 --> 11:05.433
I'd be there right now.

11:05.433 --> 11:07.767
Well, it's nice to know
that my investment

11:07.767 --> 11:10.600
in chiropractor school
was pesos well spent.

11:10.600 --> 11:11.934
Hey, you know,

11:11.934 --> 11:13.533
I-I think things are
starting to look up.

11:13.533 --> 11:16.200
I feel like I'm at a
real turning point,
career-wise.

11:16.200 --> 11:19.066
You're an eternal optimist,
aren't you, Alan?

11:19.066 --> 11:20.233
Yes. Yes, I am.

11:20.233 --> 11:23.433
Oh, that just
breaks my heart.

11:26.467 --> 11:28.233
#Men.#

11:28.233 --> 11:29.900
So, we'd make
an incision here...

11:29.900 --> 11:31.400
(deeply inhaling)

11:31.400 --> 11:32.834
(groans)
And here...

11:34.200 --> 11:36.233
And one more here.

11:36.233 --> 11:38.166
Oh, God.

11:38.166 --> 11:41.533
Then we would remove
some fatty tissue,

11:41.533 --> 11:44.000
reshape your breast
and relocate the nipple.

11:44.000 --> 11:47.533
(groaning):
Oh, not the nipples.

11:47.533 --> 11:50.166
I thought you were going
to be supportive.

11:50.166 --> 11:51.700
I am being supportive.

11:51.700 --> 11:54.200
I just didn't know we were going
to play Mr. Potato Head

11:54.200 --> 11:55.700
with our boobs.

11:55.700 --> 11:58.767
They're notourboobs,
they'remybreasts.

11:58.767 --> 12:01.200
Hey, if we were to dust 'em
for prints right now,

12:01.200 --> 12:02.433
who's suspect number one?

12:04.367 --> 12:06.633
I take it you're not entirely
on board with this.

12:06.633 --> 12:08.133
No, no, no, no,
I'm trying.

12:08.133 --> 12:10.367
I mean, I don't want her
to be in pain,

12:10.367 --> 12:12.300
but come on,
look at those babies.

12:12.300 --> 12:13.400
They're perfect.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.266
The only way you could
improve on 'em is

12:15.266 --> 12:17.433
if you could make 'em
squirt money.

12:19.500 --> 12:20.734
Don't worry.

12:20.734 --> 12:22.433
They'll still be perfect
when I'm done,

12:22.433 --> 12:24.400
except that your fiancÃ©e
will be pain-free.

12:24.400 --> 12:27.433
Hey, hey, I'm not questioning
your abilities, Doc.

12:27.433 --> 12:30.266
In fact, I've been a big fan
of your work for years.

12:30.266 --> 12:32.867
I mean, when you make 'em
freakishly huge.

12:32.867 --> 12:33.900
Really?

12:33.900 --> 12:35.333
You know my work.

12:35.333 --> 12:36.533
Oh, yeah.

12:36.533 --> 12:38.066
I have an honorary
lifetime membership

12:38.066 --> 12:39.266
at the Pussycat Palace.

12:39.900 --> 12:41.600
They named a pole after me.

12:42.900 --> 12:44.800
Uh-huh. You know, maybe

12:44.800 --> 12:46.066
it will help

12:46.066 --> 12:49.100
if you get a better sense
of the end result.

12:49.100 --> 12:50.800
Yeah.

12:50.800 --> 12:52.834
This is Chelsea now.

12:58.166 --> 12:59.633
That's about right.

13:01.467 --> 13:03.667
And this is the size
I'm recommending.

13:03.667 --> 13:05.300
Hmm.

13:05.300 --> 13:07.066
You got the one
that goes with this?

13:07.066 --> 13:09.266
Sure.

13:15.567 --> 13:17.033
(gibbering)

13:22.066 --> 13:23.900
Nah, what else you got?

13:24.600 --> 13:26.900
#Men.#

13:28.233 --> 13:30.200
I, uh, I made you
a cup of tea.

13:30.200 --> 13:31.667
Oh, thank you, dear.

13:31.667 --> 13:32.934
Whatcha doin'?

13:32.934 --> 13:35.700
Just finishing up
some escrow paperwork.

13:35.700 --> 13:40.266
Inspector found
no termite damage.

13:40.266 --> 13:43.133
Sign here, sweetie,
where it says "inspector."

13:44.633 --> 13:46.400
Is that legal?

13:46.400 --> 13:47.600
Oh, don't worry about it.

13:47.600 --> 13:49.066
There are no termites.

13:49.066 --> 13:50.967
The mold killed them.

13:50.967 --> 13:52.433
Well, I guess you have
to cut corners

13:52.433 --> 13:54.133
with the real estate market
the way it is.

13:54.133 --> 13:55.667
True dat.

13:56.967 --> 13:59.066
Initial here,
here, and here.

13:59.066 --> 14:00.300
More termite stuff?

14:00.300 --> 14:02.633
The less you know
the better, dear.

14:02.633 --> 14:05.233
Listen, I was thinking
when we're finished with this,

14:05.233 --> 14:06.700
we'd run over
to Rodeo Drive

14:06.700 --> 14:09.333
and do a little
clothes shopping.
Oh! Rodeo Drive.

14:09.333 --> 14:10.400
That sounds fun.

14:10.400 --> 14:13.100
Do they have a Sears
or a Kmart over there?

14:13.100 --> 14:15.000
Oh, don't worry about it.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.100
It's my treat.

14:16.100 --> 14:17.767
No, no, no,
I'm a grown man.

14:17.767 --> 14:20.033
I can't have my mom buying me
shirts, slacks,

14:20.033 --> 14:22.300
boxer briefs
and possibly dress shoes.

14:23.133 --> 14:24.400
You're my son, Alan.

14:24.400 --> 14:27.066
I want nothing more
than to see you happy.

14:27.066 --> 14:30.066
And not dressed like
an unemployed lesbian.

14:32.266 --> 14:36.800
Now, give me your thumb.

14:36.800 --> 14:38.767
You've never been arrested,
have you?

14:41.800 --> 14:44.066
#Men.#

14:44.066 --> 14:46.100
Berta, these
fish sticks are great.

14:46.100 --> 14:47.467
Thank you.

14:47.467 --> 14:50.633
My secret is I take 'em
out of the freezer.

14:50.633 --> 14:52.934
Well, kudos.

14:57.633 --> 14:59.000
Hey, where's my dad?

14:59.000 --> 15:00.900
(sighs)

15:00.900 --> 15:02.166
Damn it.

15:02.166 --> 15:04.333
Pay up.

15:06.867 --> 15:09.433
Thought for sure he'd stay
oblivious until Monday.

15:10.333 --> 15:12.900
Well, "obliviously,"
you were wrong.

15:15.367 --> 15:16.900
Charlie, can I talk to you
for a minute?

15:16.900 --> 15:17.967
What's up?

15:17.967 --> 15:19.667
Let's talk upstairs.

15:19.667 --> 15:21.467
Sure.

15:25.567 --> 15:27.734
Here's your cut.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.166
No, you didn't do
anything wrong.

15:34.166 --> 15:35.867
Oh, cool.

15:35.867 --> 15:37.500
So what's up?

15:37.500 --> 15:39.000
You want a quickie?

15:39.000 --> 15:40.967
No.

15:40.967 --> 15:43.200
I just got a call
from the plastic surgeon

15:43.200 --> 15:44.467
and they had a cancellation,

15:44.467 --> 15:46.734
so they can squeeze me
in tomorrow morning.

15:46.734 --> 15:48.734
Tomorrow?

15:48.734 --> 15:50.834
But... that's so soon.

15:50.834 --> 15:52.200
Why put it off?

15:52.200 --> 15:54.800
Well, I was hoping
we'd have time

15:54.800 --> 15:56.867
to go away for a few days.

15:56.867 --> 15:58.800
You know, one last fling,

15:58.800 --> 16:01.233
just the four of us.

16:02.333 --> 16:03.800
You've flung them plenty,
Charlie.

16:03.800 --> 16:06.433
Oh, come on, just
give me some more time.

16:06.433 --> 16:09.166
Time for what?
Time to talk
you out of this.

16:09.166 --> 16:10.734
You said you were
going to support me.

16:10.734 --> 16:12.667
Yeah, but when do I get
my support?

16:12.667 --> 16:13.633
What are you talking about?

16:13.633 --> 16:15.834
This decision
affects both of us.

16:15.834 --> 16:17.066
I should get a vote.

16:17.066 --> 16:18.667
You're not the one in pain.

16:18.667 --> 16:21.633
(cries):
Then why does it hurt so much?

16:25.467 --> 16:27.734
Oh, you're just
making it worse!

16:29.100 --> 16:31.300
#Men.#

16:31.300 --> 16:33.567
I love my new
silk jammies, Mom.

16:34.367 --> 16:36.266
It's like wearing
a baby seal.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.700
Well, I'm glad you
like them, dear.

16:42.700 --> 16:45.834
Oh, and I thought,
tomorrow,

16:45.834 --> 16:48.100
I could take you
to my hair stylist.

16:48.100 --> 16:50.633
Get you one of those hip,
new spiky looks.

16:50.633 --> 16:51.934
Oh, that sounds like fun.

16:51.934 --> 16:53.433
Although I'm only
two haircuts away

16:53.433 --> 16:56.100
from a free one
at the barber college.

16:56.100 --> 16:57.533
Oh, nonsense.

16:57.533 --> 16:59.800
You deserve to be
pampered a little bit.

16:59.800 --> 17:01.066
I kind of do, don't I?

17:01.066 --> 17:02.734
Yes, you do.

17:02.734 --> 17:05.900
I just have to be careful
not to make you too attractive.

17:05.900 --> 17:09.599
(chuckles)
I don't want to lose
my fella to another gal.

17:09.599 --> 17:11.567
(chortles)

17:11.567 --> 17:13.900
Your fella. Funny.

17:13.900 --> 17:15.900
Well, I'm serious.

17:15.900 --> 17:18.900
You'll always be my fella.

17:18.900 --> 17:23.032
And I'll always be
your best gal, right?

17:26.599 --> 17:28.800
Okay.

17:29.734 --> 17:33.734
And I've been thinking,
this is a big house.

17:33.734 --> 17:37.667
And you and I are clearly
not the marrying kind,

17:37.667 --> 17:42.266
so... why don't you
just move in?

17:43.100 --> 17:44.500
Here?

17:44.500 --> 17:47.233
Sure. Why not?

17:47.233 --> 17:50.066
Can't you see how you and me

17:50.066 --> 17:51.967
are meant to be?

17:53.633 --> 17:57.133
Well, we're meant to be
mother and son.

17:57.133 --> 17:59.800
That's a given.

17:59.800 --> 18:02.000
It's how we're livin'.

18:02.867 --> 18:06.100
Very clever.

18:08.200 --> 18:11.166
Of course,
there is a certain

18:11.166 --> 18:13.433
financial imbalance.

18:13.433 --> 18:15.533
But I'm sure that we can

18:15.533 --> 18:18.333
come up with a plan that
meets both of our needs.

18:18.333 --> 18:19.700
Plan? There's a,
there's a plan?

18:19.700 --> 18:22.867
Of course there's a plan.

18:24.400 --> 18:27.467
I mean, I'm a vibrant
woman now, Alan,

18:27.467 --> 18:30.266
but there will come
a time when I won't be able

18:30.266 --> 18:33.934
to fend for myself and I don't
want to pay some stranger

18:33.934 --> 18:37.834
to dress me and feed me
and carry me to the bath,

18:37.834 --> 18:39.700
soap up a wash cloth

18:39.700 --> 18:42.834
and give me a good,
thorough cleaning.

18:42.834 --> 18:45.367
Thanks, Mom! I'll call you.

18:48.100 --> 18:50.400
That should keep him away
for a while.

18:50.400 --> 18:53.400
#Men.#

18:53.400 --> 18:55.000
(crying)

18:56.467 --> 18:58.100
Are you sure you're
gonna be okay?

18:58.100 --> 18:59.967
I'm fine.

19:01.800 --> 19:03.333
Would you do me
a little favor?

19:03.333 --> 19:05.066
What?

19:05.066 --> 19:06.934
Go like this.

19:09.433 --> 19:11.066
For old time's sake.

19:11.900 --> 19:13.033
NURSE:
Chelsea?

19:13.033 --> 19:15.433
Ready for you.
Oh, God, this is it.

19:16.633 --> 19:18.166
Take a deep breath,
Charlie.

19:18.166 --> 19:20.667
I will if you will.

19:20.667 --> 19:23.467
It's still gonna be me,
just a little smaller.

19:23.467 --> 19:25.100
I know.

19:25.100 --> 19:26.600
I guess the good news is

19:26.600 --> 19:28.433
it'll draw more attention
to your backside.

19:28.433 --> 19:30.967
What?

19:30.967 --> 19:33.467
You know, with your
breasts smaller,

19:33.467 --> 19:35.734
the eye will naturally
go to your ample tush.

19:35.734 --> 19:37.800
Are you saying my ass
is too big?

19:37.800 --> 19:40.333
No, no, no,
I love your ass.

19:40.333 --> 19:42.233
I'm just saying
with smaller boobs,

19:42.233 --> 19:43.467
more people will notice it.

19:43.467 --> 19:44.600
Are you insane?

19:44.600 --> 19:46.233
I don't want people
noticing my ass.

19:46.233 --> 19:48.300
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
don't kill the messenger.

19:48.300 --> 19:49.600
It's the first law
of landscaping.

19:49.600 --> 19:51.667
If you trim down the tree,
the backyard looks bigger.

19:51.667 --> 19:53.800
Am I right?

19:53.800 --> 19:55.600
Damn you, Charlie Harper.

19:55.600 --> 19:58.133
What?
Tell the doctor
I changed my mind.

19:58.133 --> 19:59.333
What did I say?

19:59.333 --> 20:00.800
Where are you going?
Home.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.000
What about your back pain?

20:02.000 --> 20:03.833
I'll live with it.
Are you sure?

20:03.833 --> 20:05.433
I live with you, don't I?

20:05.433 --> 20:07.067
Come on.

20:07.067 --> 20:09.700
How about that?

20:11.433 --> 20:12.566
Thank you, Lord.

20:12.566 --> 20:13.866
You speaketh through me.
