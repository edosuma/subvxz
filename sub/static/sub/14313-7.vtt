Little man

18:10.289 --> 18:13.891

[♪♪♪]

20:38.403 --> 20:40.236
Nice work, Logan.

20:40.238 --> 20:42.940
Maybe you should be working
for S.H.I.E.L.D. full-time.

20:42.942 --> 20:45.276
You saved a lot
of innocent lives today.

20:45.278 --> 20:47.911
Is that what I did? Huh.

20:47.913 --> 20:50.014
'Cause the way I see it,

20:50.016 --> 20:52.315
all I did here
was clean up your mess.

20:52.317 --> 20:53.851
Excuse me?

20:53.853 --> 20:57.988
Pretty convenient you had
all that data for Banner's cure,

20:57.990 --> 21:00.824
and you knew
right where the monster was.

21:00.826 --> 21:03.176
Of course, it's pretty easy
information to get

21:03.178 --> 21:05.295
when you created it all.

21:05.297 --> 21:08.265
You purposely created
that thing?

21:08.267 --> 21:11.251
For what?
A super-soldier?

21:11.253 --> 21:13.503
A monster under your control?

21:13.505 --> 21:16.206

S.H.I.E.L.D.
doesn't answer to you two.

21:22.231 --> 21:26.349
You're just tools to be used
when I see fit. Get it?

21:26.351 --> 21:28.986
Oh yeah, I get it,

21:28.988 --> 21:30.487

If you ever breathe a word

21:31.907 --> 21:34.942
about what you've got
on the X-Men to anyone,

know exactly what
you're doing out here.

Fine.

Oh, and one last thing.

21:47.872 --> 21:48.755
