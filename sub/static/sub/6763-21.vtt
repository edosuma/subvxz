02:07.480 --> 02:10.312
Nice and easy. I got you.

02:11.520 --> 02:13.511
Easy.

02:36.560 --> 02:38.710
Honey, I know you're excited
about this boat,

02:38.880 --> 02:41.997
but considering how cold it is and
what the weatherman's predicting...

02:42.160 --> 02:43.912
Oh, come on.
There is not a cloud in the sky.

02:44.080 --> 02:46.036
Besides, if there's one thing
I learned in the joint,

02:46.200 --> 02:48.111
it's to live each day
like it might be your last,

02:48.280 --> 02:49.679
because you never know.

02:49.840 --> 02:51.353
Jack, don't be so morbid.

02:51.520 --> 02:53.875
He can't help it. It's just his nature.

02:54.040 --> 02:56.156
Come on, let's go.

03:00.400 --> 03:02.709
All right, now. Well, come on, you two.
Which one is it?

03:02.880 --> 03:04.836
I hate it when he does this.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.798
Come on, why should I make it easy?
You gotta guess.

03:07.960 --> 03:09.154
- That one.
- No.

03:09.320 --> 03:10.309
- That one?
- No.

03:10.480 --> 03:13.950
- Come on.
- Come on, you can do better than that.

03:14.120 --> 03:15.951
That.

03:16.720 --> 03:18.711
No, wise guy.

03:19.960 --> 03:21.837
That one.

03:24.520 --> 03:26.351
Now, how did you swing that?

03:26.520 --> 03:28.590
I got friends in real low places.

03:30.680 --> 03:32.671
I'm driving.

03:36.080 --> 03:38.958
- Hi, you the new live-aboards?
- Yeah.

03:39.480 --> 03:43.029
- She's a beaut.
- Thanks.

03:45.440 --> 03:47.556
Mr. McKay, welcome aboard.

03:47.720 --> 03:49.199
- Terry, how you doing?
- I'm good.

03:49.560 --> 03:51.630
- Terry, this is Christine Pettit.
- It's a pleasure.

03:51.800 --> 03:52.789
This is my son, Dylan.

03:52.960 --> 03:54.075
- Hi, Dylan.
- Hi.

03:54.240 --> 03:55.753
This is Terry Wilson, our captain.

03:55.920 --> 03:58.275
- This is my first mate, Mel Borman.
- Ahoy.

03:58.440 --> 03:59.714
- Can we show you around?
- Let's--

03:59.880 --> 04:02.155
- Lead the way.
- All right.

04:13.400 --> 04:15.789
Little nicer than Cell Block 8,
don't you think?

04:15.960 --> 04:18.997
Yeah, just a little bit.
What did you do to deserve this?

04:19.160 --> 04:23.119
Well, I took a fall for a lot of guys that
could have gone down with me, so...

04:23.280 --> 04:24.872
Well, let's just say
it's payback time.

04:25.040 --> 04:28.476
Oh, Jack, this is exquisite.

04:28.640 --> 04:31.074
Well, we have got the forward cabin.

04:31.240 --> 04:33.515
It's the one with the hot tub.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.230
I can't wait.

04:36.400 --> 04:38.834
Listen, why don't you two
go with Mel, okay?

04:39.000 --> 04:41.116
I've gotta talk over a couple details
with Captain Wilson.

04:41.280 --> 04:42.269
All right.

04:42.440 --> 04:44.749
- Go ahead.
- Thanks.

04:54.160 --> 04:57.709
- You got yourself a fine son there.
- Leave my son out of this.

04:57.880 --> 05:00.553
Little late for that, don't you think?

05:00.720 --> 05:03.553
By the way, Jack, we were told
we could expect the money by now.

05:03.720 --> 05:04.869
<i>What's the holdup?</i>

05:05.040 --> 05:08.157
<i>Look, I told you,</i>
<i>it takes time to get these things done,</i>

05:08.320 --> 05:11.869
<i>Yeah, Well, time is money,</i>

05:12.040 --> 05:15.999
So speed it up,
or you can kiss our little deal goodbye.

05:20.920 --> 05:24.993
Dad, this is a great boat.

05:25.160 --> 05:27.628
- Well, I'm glad you like it.
- So which cabin's mine?

05:27.800 --> 05:30.439
- Well, you just take your pick.
- Okay.

05:30.600 --> 05:31.999
Hey, listen,
could you do me a favour?

05:32.160 --> 05:33.149
Yeah.

05:33.320 --> 05:35.151
Could you give Jim Walsh
a call this afternoon?

05:35.320 --> 05:36.435
What for?

05:36.600 --> 05:38.955
I just think we should have heard
something by now, don't you?

05:39.840 --> 05:41.478
Jack, his daughter's
not even talking to me.

05:41.640 --> 05:44.279
I don't think Jim Walsh would be
too crazy about hearing from me now.

05:44.440 --> 05:47.159
Dylan, come on,
business is business.

05:47.520 --> 05:49.112
So if it's business,
why don't you do it?

05:49.280 --> 05:50.952
Well, because it's not appropriate.

05:51.120 --> 05:53.998
I mean, that's your trust fund,
it's not mine.

05:54.440 --> 05:55.589
Okay. I'll look into it.

05:55.760 --> 05:57.478
All right, thanks.

05:57.640 --> 05:59.995
Why don't you get your lazy butt
out of here and get to school?

06:00.160 --> 06:01.878
- All right.
- All right.

06:02.320 --> 06:03.753
You take care.

06:12.680 --> 06:15.433
I can't believe I have a son who's
the editor of the school newspaper

06:15.600 --> 06:17.318
who reads nothing
but the sports section.

06:17.480 --> 06:18.549
Dad, stop the bombing.

06:18.720 --> 06:21.757
Brandon, it is important to know
what is happening in the world.

06:21.920 --> 06:22.909
I realise that, Dad.

06:23.080 --> 06:25.196
We've been having the same
conversation since I was 12.

06:25.360 --> 06:27.476
You know, when I was a kid,
my father made me--

06:27.640 --> 06:31.428
Read the entire paper before he let you
read the sports section, I know.

06:32.080 --> 06:33.832
I was the only 8-year-old
in Anoka, Minnesota

06:34.000 --> 06:36.309
who could name every member
of Harry Truman's cabinet.

06:36.480 --> 06:37.469
Harry who?

06:40.240 --> 06:41.832
- Morning, ladies.
- Morning.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.194
Are you guys ready for this?

06:43.360 --> 06:45.828
Toby Anderson got mugged
jogging at Roxbury Park this morning.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.558
Can you believe it?

06:47.720 --> 06:49.073
Now, where is that flyer?

06:49.760 --> 06:51.512
I know I put it in here somewhere.

06:51.680 --> 06:52.669
What flyer?

06:52.840 --> 06:55.195
- There were police cars everywhere.
- Well, was she hurt?

06:55.360 --> 06:58.557
Well, she was banged up a little
but she's gonna be fine. Thank God.

06:58.720 --> 06:59.755
Here it is.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.831
I knew there was a reason
I kept this.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.753
There's a self-defence workshop
at the community centre this weekend.

07:04.920 --> 07:08.390
Brenda, it's time we armed ourselves.
What do you think?

07:08.560 --> 07:11.552
Why not?
It's not like I have any other plans.

07:19.280 --> 07:20.474
Good, I'm glad you're both up.

07:20.640 --> 07:21.993
Morning, Mom.

07:22.160 --> 07:24.071
I've got something
I need to talk to you about.

07:24.240 --> 07:25.355
What's up?

07:26.640 --> 07:29.996
I've been going over figures with my
accountant the past couple of weeks,

07:31.120 --> 07:33.031
and the more I try
to make the numbers work,

07:33.400 --> 07:36.153
the more I realise
I don't have a choice,

07:36.320 --> 07:38.117
we have to sell this house.

07:39.120 --> 07:40.109
What?

07:40.280 --> 07:42.794
The mortgage on this place is huge
and we're on our own now.

07:44.440 --> 07:47.352
- This is all my dad's fault.
- No, David, it's not.

07:47.520 --> 07:49.715
It's just the way
life works out sometimes.

07:49.880 --> 07:52.599
When I married your dad,
I gave up my alimony.

07:52.760 --> 07:54.955
It wasn't fair to ask your father
for that kind of support.

07:55.120 --> 07:57.509
He's taking care of Erin,
that's what's important.

07:58.560 --> 08:00.198
I just don't believe
this is happening.

08:00.800 --> 08:02.597
I'm sorry, sweetie.

08:02.760 --> 08:05.877
We can talk about it more tonight.
ln the meantime, I've gotta get dressed.

08:06.040 --> 08:07.951
The real-estate agent's
coming this morning.

08:10.920 --> 08:12.876
I can't believe this.

08:13.040 --> 08:16.271
I mean, through three husbands
and two boyfriends,

08:16.440 --> 08:19.159
this house was the one thing
that always stayed the same.

08:20.680 --> 08:21.954
I feel terrible.

08:23.720 --> 08:24.709
I'll get it.

08:28.200 --> 08:29.189
Hello?

08:29.360 --> 08:31.874
Yes, he is. Can I ask who's calling?

08:32.039 --> 08:33.029
Hold on.

08:33.200 --> 08:35.077
It's some guy named Serge Menkin?

08:35.960 --> 08:37.996
- Oh, my God.
- Who is he?

08:38.159 --> 08:40.275
He's a record producer.
He's my record producer.

08:40.440 --> 08:43.876
I can't believe he's calling here.
I can't believe he's actually calling me.

08:44.039 --> 08:46.315
Are you gonna talk to him or not?

08:46.480 --> 08:48.277
Yeah.

08:50.640 --> 08:52.631
Mr. Menkin.

08:52.800 --> 08:55.951
Oh, sure. Yeah, that's no problem.

08:56.560 --> 08:58.790
Oh, that's great.

08:58.960 --> 09:02.077
Oh, I'm really looking forward
to this too, Serge.

09:02.520 --> 09:04.397
Okay.

09:05.360 --> 09:06.679
I can't believe this.

09:06.840 --> 09:08.637
We're actually going into the studio
next week.

09:08.800 --> 09:10.518
We're gonna be laying down
rhythm tracks.

09:10.680 --> 09:12.193
That's great.

09:12.360 --> 09:13.509
Do me a favour, David,

09:13.680 --> 09:15.955
hurry up and get rich
so you can buy this house.

09:23.920 --> 09:25.831
You know, I know some bookie
in Pacoima

09:26.000 --> 09:27.831
who's giving great odds
on sumo wrestling.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.309
Hi, Steve.

09:30.480 --> 09:32.948
New car stereo, new skis.

09:33.120 --> 09:34.553
You're really raking in the dough,
huh?

09:34.720 --> 09:36.073
I'm just lucky, I guess.

09:36.240 --> 09:39.357
Well, I got two words for you:
Pete Rose.

09:39.520 --> 09:42.557
I got two words for you too.

09:42.720 --> 09:43.709
Steve.

09:45.800 --> 09:47.836
Listen, I'm sorry about
the whole record-deal thing.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.958
- I thought for the sake of my career--
- I don't wanna hear about your career.

09:51.120 --> 09:54.749
- But Serge Menkin called me.
- I don't wanna hear about it.

09:54.920 --> 09:58.435
<i>Yo, TGlF, West Beverly,</i>

09:58.600 --> 09:59.919
Donna-Donna here,
and you know what?

10:00.080 --> 10:02.389
I have got Friday on my mind.

10:02.560 --> 10:03.788
You know
what I wanna know about?

10:03.960 --> 10:07.748
I wanna know why we make
such a big deal out of Friday.

10:07.920 --> 10:10.150
I mean, what about all the teenagers
in the world

10:10.320 --> 10:13.153
that have absolutely nothing to do
this weekend?

10:13.320 --> 10:15.117
Aren't we just rubbing it
in their faces?

10:15.280 --> 10:19.068
I mean, well, not like I don't have
a packed social calendar or anything.

10:19.240 --> 10:23.950
But however, it is something
to think about, and sing about.

10:28.240 --> 10:30.196
- Hello.
- What are you doing tonight?

10:30.920 --> 10:33.036
- David's coming over.
- Not anymore.

10:33.200 --> 10:35.395
- You're coming with me.
- Where?

10:35.560 --> 10:37.676
Donna, self-defence for women.

10:37.840 --> 10:39.592
It's time we learned
how to defend ourselves.

10:40.720 --> 10:42.756
Bren, you know
I am not the aggressive type.

10:42.920 --> 10:45.036
Well, it's time you learned to be.

10:45.200 --> 10:48.237
Donna, I was attacked once.
I'm never going to be a victim again.

10:48.720 --> 10:52.508
Okay, but where did the sudden urge
for power come from?

10:53.520 --> 10:56.557
A lady in our neighbourhood
was mugged this morning.

10:58.600 --> 10:59.589
Wait a minute.

10:59.760 --> 11:01.990
Are you sure it's not because
you don't have anything to do?

11:02.160 --> 11:04.754
- Donna.
- I'm just asking.

11:06.040 --> 11:09.077
It might have a little something to do
with it, but it's not the main reason.

11:09.240 --> 11:10.912
I mean, you can see David anytime.

11:11.080 --> 11:12.229
TGlF, guys.

11:12.400 --> 11:14.960
Andrea, would you explain to Donna
that it's far more important

11:15.120 --> 11:18.112
to take a self-defence class than to
hang with her boyfriend this weekend.

11:18.280 --> 11:20.475
Absolutely. Far more important.

11:20.640 --> 11:23.200
Well, have you actually ever taken
one of these classes?

11:23.360 --> 11:26.591
No, but I hear they're wonderful.
I mean, very empowering.

11:26.760 --> 11:28.239
- You see.
- Great.

11:28.400 --> 11:30.834
You go with Brenda
and I'll go out with David.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.275
I can't.

11:33.440 --> 11:36.034
I have a date.

11:36.760 --> 11:38.193
Who are you going out with?

11:47.680 --> 11:49.079
Dylan.

11:49.240 --> 11:52.391
- Did you have an appointment?
- No, but I called you today twice.

11:52.560 --> 11:54.471
Oh, gee.
I'm sorry I didn't get back to you.

11:54.640 --> 11:57.154
It's just been one
of those hectic days.

11:57.320 --> 11:59.959
Up to my earlobes in alligators.

12:00.120 --> 12:01.519
What can I do for you?

12:01.680 --> 12:04.319
Well, my father and I were wondering
if there were any problems.

12:04.480 --> 12:06.948
I mean, we haven't heard anything.

12:07.760 --> 12:09.193
Dylan, this is not a good time.

12:09.360 --> 12:10.952
I got a partners' meeting
in 20 minutes.

12:11.120 --> 12:12.917
Does that mean there are problems?

12:14.200 --> 12:15.553
Dylan,

12:15.720 --> 12:18.598
I've thought about this long
and hard.

12:18.760 --> 12:20.591
I just can't go along
with what you want.

12:20.760 --> 12:21.875
What?

12:23.280 --> 12:25.271
I'm just not ready
to dissolve your trust fund.

12:25.720 --> 12:26.709
All I'm trying to do here

12:26.880 --> 12:29.872
is to be objective and to look out
for your best interest.

12:30.040 --> 12:32.918
I will decide
what is in my best interest.

12:33.080 --> 12:36.311
- Not you. Not anybody.
- Does that include your father?

12:37.360 --> 12:39.271
All you know is what you read
in the newspapers

12:39.440 --> 12:40.919
and what they tell you
on the 6:00 news.

12:41.080 --> 12:45.710
Now, my father deserves a second
chance and I'm gonna give it to him.

12:46.200 --> 12:48.873
Look, Dylan, that's very noble of you,

12:49.040 --> 12:51.793
but a trustee has to be
a little bit more impartial than that.

12:52.480 --> 12:56.268
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have to get to a meeting.

12:56.440 --> 12:59.512
So that's it?
You're just gonna stonewall me?

13:00.320 --> 13:02.470
Look, son, you've made your point.

13:02.640 --> 13:07.350
And I promise you
that I will take it under advisement.

13:08.760 --> 13:12.275
Yeah, and you've made your point,

13:12.440 --> 13:16.035
which was neither objective
or impartial.

13:31.160 --> 13:34.470
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, honey.

13:35.760 --> 13:37.432
I thought you had a date
with Dylan tonight.

13:37.600 --> 13:40.512
Yeah, he said he had some things
to talk over with his dad.

13:40.680 --> 13:42.716
- What are you doing?
- Cleaning.

13:42.880 --> 13:44.632
The real-estate caravan
is coming tomorrow.

13:44.800 --> 13:48.031
- I want the place to look its best.
- What's a real-estate caravan?

13:48.200 --> 13:50.873
Dozens of strangers
snooping around your house.

13:52.560 --> 13:54.152
I still can't believe we're moving.

13:54.320 --> 13:56.390
Don't pack yet. We have to sell first.

13:56.560 --> 13:59.358
Yeah, but still,
it just feels like everything's changing.

13:59.520 --> 14:02.876
Well, that's probably
because everything is changing.

14:03.600 --> 14:06.068
I mean, it's not just the house.
It's me.

14:06.520 --> 14:09.717
It's my friends. I don't even know who's
talking to me this week and who's not.

14:09.880 --> 14:11.154
Brenda still not speaking to you?

14:11.320 --> 14:13.788
She says hello but that's about it.
I mean, it's Friday night.

14:13.960 --> 14:16.872
Do you know how many times we
would've talked on the phone by now?

14:17.040 --> 14:19.270
Well, honey,
this has got to be difficult for her.

14:19.760 --> 14:21.716
You got something she wanted.

14:21.880 --> 14:24.030
Believe me,
that's a tough pill to swallow.

14:24.200 --> 14:26.316
Yeah, I guess so.

14:26.480 --> 14:27.959
Give her some time.

14:28.120 --> 14:30.759
She's gotta come to terms with this
in her own way.

14:34.320 --> 14:37.790
My name is Grace Feldman
and I'm your instructor.

14:37.960 --> 14:40.872
And this is my assistant, Ralphie.

14:41.040 --> 14:45.511
He's big, he's dumb
and he wants your purse.

14:45.680 --> 14:48.399
ln this country, a woman
is battered every six minutes.

14:48.560 --> 14:50.835
A woman is raped
every three minutes.

14:51.000 --> 14:51.989
Oh, my God.

14:52.160 --> 14:54.151
And that's just the reported cases.

14:54.320 --> 14:55.594
By coming here tonight,

14:55.760 --> 14:57.990
you're saying
that violence against women

14:58.160 --> 15:01.391
is no longer going to be
an accepted part of our culture.

15:01.560 --> 15:05.235
So before we partner up
and beat the heck out of each other--

15:05.400 --> 15:08.551
Only kidding.
--why don't you introduce yourselves?

15:08.720 --> 15:12.156
And if you'd like,
tell us why you're here.

15:13.800 --> 15:14.789
I'm Cindy.

15:14.960 --> 15:17.713
And I'm here
because I hate feeling scared

15:17.880 --> 15:20.110
when I'm walking around the streets
of my own neighbourhood.

15:20.280 --> 15:24.398
And I wanna know what to do
if anyone should ever try to hurt me.

15:24.560 --> 15:27.597
That's a terrific reason.
Anybody else here for that reason?

15:29.200 --> 15:31.430
Great. Who else?

15:32.720 --> 15:36.030
I'm Brenda, and I'm her daughter.

15:36.200 --> 15:38.953
About a year ago
a guy held a gun to my head

15:39.120 --> 15:41.190
and threatened to kill me
if I didn't do what he said.

15:42.160 --> 15:43.275
So I did.

15:43.440 --> 15:46.796
I mean, he didn't hurt me or anything,
but it was still pretty scary.

15:46.960 --> 15:48.439
Are you still angry about it?

15:48.880 --> 15:49.869
Yeah.

15:50.040 --> 15:51.268
Good.

15:51.440 --> 15:53.829
That's gonna work for you.

15:54.320 --> 15:56.914
There are times
when you may have to submit.

15:57.080 --> 15:59.992
But when guns are not involved,
and most times they're not,

16:00.160 --> 16:05.837
a woman's best weapon are her wits,
her voice and her body.

16:06.600 --> 16:07.589
Next.

16:08.960 --> 16:11.235
Hi, I'm Donna.

16:11.400 --> 16:16.155
Well, actually, I'm just here because
my best friend here made me come.

16:16.320 --> 16:17.958
Donna, that's as good a reason
as any.

16:18.640 --> 16:20.471
You have a smart best friend.

16:32.080 --> 16:33.433
Hi.

16:33.600 --> 16:35.272
Hey, Dad. How's it going?

16:35.440 --> 16:37.874
Not as well as I thought.

16:39.240 --> 16:41.231
I just got a call from Jim Walsh.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.309
Yeah, I was gonna tell you,
I saw him this afternoon.

16:45.040 --> 16:47.156
<i>What the hell is it with this guy?</i>

16:47.320 --> 16:48.958
<i>He says he's just looking out for me,</i>

16:49.120 --> 16:51.475
<i>Well, I'm your father,</i>
<i>I think that's my job, isn't it?</i>

16:51.640 --> 16:54.313
Come on, Dad.
I mean, he'll come around eventually.

16:54.480 --> 16:56.630
It's not like we're that hard up
for the money, are we?

16:56.800 --> 16:58.756
No, no.

16:58.920 --> 17:01.309
No, we'll be okay,

17:01.480 --> 17:03.596
one way or another.

17:20.839 --> 17:21.829
One free throw.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.673
One free throw and I lose 200 bucks.
It's not fair.

17:24.839 --> 17:26.478
That's basketball, Brandon.

17:26.640 --> 17:28.311
How many times
do I have to tell you?

17:28.480 --> 17:30.835
It's not football. Stats and point
spreads are meaningless.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.639
Well, I got three more games this
weekend. I'll come back. You'll see.

17:33.800 --> 17:35.518
Yeah, that's what they all say.

17:35.680 --> 17:37.432
Brandon, get over to the register.

17:37.600 --> 17:41.354
Andrea and her boyfriend wanna make
a contribution to my retirement fund.

17:41.520 --> 17:42.953
- You got it.
- Boyfriend?

17:43.120 --> 17:46.556
- lsn't that the guy from Shaw?
- Yeah.

17:48.320 --> 17:51.278
- Mr. Bonner, good to see you.
- You too, Brandon of Beverly Hills.

17:51.440 --> 17:52.555
- How's it going?
- Good, man.

17:52.720 --> 17:55.393
- Good. Congratulations on Yale.
- Thanks, man.

17:55.560 --> 17:57.312
Thanks. So where are you guys
off to?

17:57.480 --> 17:59.311
Going to the movies.
We're gonna see <i>Hoffa,</i>

17:59.480 --> 18:01.869
<i>Hoffa,</i> Outstanding.
Have a good time.

18:02.040 --> 18:03.359
We will.

18:03.520 --> 18:04.555
- Thank you.
- Bye, guys.

18:04.720 --> 18:06.278
Bye.

18:09.520 --> 18:11.875
I can't believe
they're actually going on a real date.

18:12.040 --> 18:13.268
Talk about an odd couple.

18:13.440 --> 18:14.873
You mean that <i>Jungle Fever</i> thing?

18:15.040 --> 18:16.075
No, Steve.

18:16.240 --> 18:18.390
- Well, that's what you meant.
- That isn't what I meant.

18:18.560 --> 18:20.471
I don't care if the guy's
pink with blue polka dots.

18:20.640 --> 18:23.074
- I just don't see them together.
- Why not?

18:23.240 --> 18:25.435
You said yourself,
they both got into Yale.

18:25.600 --> 18:28.637
- Probably do have a lot in common.
- Yeah, I guess.

18:28.800 --> 18:31.758
You just can't stand to see Andrea
go out with someone who isn't you.

18:32.480 --> 18:34.198
- Steve.
- You did the same thing last summer

18:34.360 --> 18:36.237
when she started dating
that Jay guy.

18:36.720 --> 18:38.676
Yeah, I guess I did, didn't I?

18:38.840 --> 18:40.751
Maybe it's a good thing
Andrea's going to Yale.

18:41.360 --> 18:43.920
You know, it's weird. We never
did anything more than just kiss,

18:44.080 --> 18:47.231
but I just can't get off
this possessive trip with her.

18:48.240 --> 18:51.437
You guys kissed? You and Andrea?

18:51.600 --> 18:54.433
- Forget it, Steve.
- No. No, no, no, no.

18:54.600 --> 18:56.716
When did you guys kiss?

19:01.680 --> 19:04.558
- Hi, honey. How was class?
- Oh, it was terrific.

19:04.720 --> 19:07.439
- Especially for Brenda.
- Oh, great.

19:07.600 --> 19:09.192
Maybe it'll help
get her mind off Dylan.

19:09.800 --> 19:12.189
Oh, honey, it was so much more
than that.

19:12.360 --> 19:14.351
I mean, she's got a lot of anger
bottled up inside.

19:14.520 --> 19:16.636
I wasn't even aware how much.

19:16.800 --> 19:20.236
I really think this class could help her
turn it into something useful.

19:20.400 --> 19:22.834
- Something positive.
- That's terrific.

19:23.000 --> 19:26.470
As for me,
I just feel achy and pooped.

19:26.640 --> 19:29.598
I never knew how many muscles
it took to be assertive.

19:30.560 --> 19:32.869
Come here, Wonder Woman.

19:33.480 --> 19:37.314
- Oh, I don't deserve you.
- I know.

19:38.080 --> 19:41.993
"Pros and cons." What's this?

19:42.160 --> 19:43.912
I'm making a list to help me decide

19:44.080 --> 19:48.358
what to do about signing
the revocation of Dylan's trust.

19:48.520 --> 19:50.476
"Cons: Don't trust Jack McKay.

19:51.080 --> 19:53.071
Jack McKay won't invest wisely.

19:53.240 --> 19:55.595
Jack McKay's a known thief
and ex-con.

19:55.760 --> 19:57.034
Pros:

19:57.200 --> 19:58.713
Dylan deserves a father."

20:02.480 --> 20:05.313
- That's a lot of cons.
- And one ex-con.

20:05.480 --> 20:08.756
- And only one pro.
- Yeah, you see my dilemma.

20:08.920 --> 20:11.434
Yes, I do, honey.

20:12.240 --> 20:15.869
But you know,
maybe it's time we let go of Dylan.

20:16.040 --> 20:20.113
I mean, we can't be
surrogate parents forever.

20:20.280 --> 20:24.034
And he's not even going out
with our daughter anymore.

20:26.680 --> 20:30.514
Thanks. I needed that.

20:33.200 --> 20:34.952
Yes, of course, back to work.

20:35.120 --> 20:36.838
That's it, honey. Right--
You feel that there?

20:39.240 --> 20:40.434
How are you holding up?

20:40.600 --> 20:42.192
Not very good, Mom.
These people are gross.

20:42.360 --> 20:45.079
As long as they have clients
who want to buy.

20:45.240 --> 20:47.879
Jackie, someone wants to know,

20:48.040 --> 20:50.679
did the house come
with the glass brick in the bathroom

20:50.840 --> 20:53.638
or were you just trying
to make a statement?

20:57.840 --> 21:00.035
I think we've got us some live ones.

21:00.200 --> 21:02.509
Kelly, David, this is Rob Lanze,
my real-estate agent.

21:02.680 --> 21:03.908
How do you do?

21:04.080 --> 21:06.389
Kelly, do me a favour.
Get your mother out of here.

21:06.560 --> 21:09.358
This is gut-wrenching
even for the toughest of souls.

21:09.520 --> 21:11.078
Yeah, I think that's a good idea,
Mom.

21:11.240 --> 21:13.708
No, I think I should stay.
This is too important.

21:13.880 --> 21:16.314
Whatever possessed them to put
parquet floors in the dining room?

21:16.480 --> 21:19.836
- This is Beverly Hills, not Hackensack.
- Kelly, David--

21:20.000 --> 21:22.753
Did you catch the giant fish farms
in the walls?

21:22.920 --> 21:24.512
This isn't a house, it's an aquarium.

21:24.840 --> 21:26.796
- I think we should leave.
- Yeah, I'll drive.

21:26.960 --> 21:28.393
I got the back seat.

21:36.320 --> 21:37.833
Good afternoon, Jack. Dylan.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.798
Look, Jim, let's forgo
the niceties, okay?

21:40.960 --> 21:42.313
lris agreed to this arrangement.

21:42.480 --> 21:44.391
Would you tell me
what the hell is going on?

21:44.800 --> 21:45.915
Nothing's going on.

21:46.080 --> 21:47.991
Why don't you sit down
and I'll explain?

21:50.960 --> 21:52.837
After our meeting I told Dylan

21:53.000 --> 21:55.753
that I was taking his position
under advisement.

21:55.920 --> 21:58.798
Now I'm advising both of you

21:58.960 --> 22:00.359
that I'm signing the papers.

22:00.520 --> 22:01.509
What?

22:02.000 --> 22:04.355
- Money's yours.
- Great.

22:04.920 --> 22:06.273
Then we're back in business.

22:06.440 --> 22:09.079
- Thank you, Jim.
- Don't thank me.

22:09.520 --> 22:13.308
As a matter of fact,
I owe you both an apology.

22:13.480 --> 22:14.469
First of all to you, Jack,

22:14.640 --> 22:17.837
for not being able to get past
my own prejudices

22:18.000 --> 22:20.150
about what a real father should be.

22:20.320 --> 22:24.518
And to you, Dylan,
for getting in your way of having one.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.353
Apology accepted.

22:26.960 --> 22:30.350
- However unnecessary.
- I wouldn't go that far.

22:33.160 --> 22:35.151
- So, Jack, what's next?
- Next?

22:35.320 --> 22:39.836
Well, next, I start the long journey back
to making up for lost time.

22:40.000 --> 22:43.117
But before that, how about the three of
us going out for a celebratory dinner?

22:43.280 --> 22:44.269
On me.

22:44.440 --> 22:46.476
No, thanks.
But why don't the two of you go?

22:46.640 --> 22:49.029
Oh, come on, Jim.
You sure about that?

22:49.520 --> 22:50.509
Yeah.

22:52.880 --> 22:55.075
Okay. Thanks a lot, Jim.

22:55.240 --> 22:57.629
- Take care, Jack.
- Take care.

22:59.760 --> 23:01.830
Good luck, son.

23:11.760 --> 23:14.877
<i>So she says, "You can go,</i>
<i>but your shoes stay here,"</i>

23:17.520 --> 23:20.114
Kelly, you hardly touched your food.
You eat like a bird.

23:20.280 --> 23:21.474
I had a big lunch.

23:21.640 --> 23:23.437
Now, Kel, come on.
You can't get too skinny.

23:23.600 --> 23:24.589
You see, we McKay men,

23:24.760 --> 23:27.558
we like our women
to look like women, not little boys.

23:28.960 --> 23:31.315
You wanna slap him?
You're the closest.

23:32.320 --> 23:33.469
Hang on.

23:33.640 --> 23:35.517
Okay, here we go.

23:35.680 --> 23:38.990
To the future greatness
of the new and improved McKay clan.

23:39.160 --> 23:40.718
Hear, hear.

23:42.280 --> 23:43.952
- To Kelly.
- What'd I do?

23:44.120 --> 23:46.395
I don't know, but whatever
you're doing, keep on doing it

23:46.560 --> 23:48.551
because I have never seen
Dylan happier.

23:48.720 --> 23:51.712
- Oh, I know what it is.
- Dylan, shut up.

23:53.680 --> 23:55.716
And to Dylan, my son,

23:55.880 --> 23:57.393
who had to grow up way too fast

23:57.560 --> 23:59.630
because his old man
was a screwed-up kid for too long.

24:02.480 --> 24:03.674
I owe you.

24:04.280 --> 24:05.395
I'll collect.

24:07.600 --> 24:10.478
And to my beautiful,
beautiful Christine,

24:10.640 --> 24:12.676
the only woman I've ever known

24:12.840 --> 24:16.628
who can hang a spoon on her nose
for over ten seconds.

24:17.720 --> 24:19.073
- Oh, boy.
- Watch this.

24:21.360 --> 24:24.591
And a woman I would love
to spend the rest of my life with.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.353
Miss Christine Pettit,

24:30.520 --> 24:35.833
will you please do me the honour
of becoming my wife?

24:36.120 --> 24:38.315
Jack.

24:43.200 --> 24:45.077
I take it that means yes?

24:45.240 --> 24:48.073
Yes. Yes. Yes.

25:01.520 --> 25:05.718
This is my client's top offer.

25:07.000 --> 25:08.399
ls this a seven or a two?

25:08.560 --> 25:11.996
It's a two, and my sincere feeling
is grab it before it becomes a one.

25:12.160 --> 25:13.832
This is a five-bedroom house.

25:14.000 --> 25:16.912
It's a buyer's market.
The ball is not in your court.

25:17.080 --> 25:19.594
Well, Jackie,
I know it's not what you were asking...

25:19.760 --> 25:21.193
Yeah, it's insulting.

25:21.360 --> 25:24.557
It's up to you. I'm not gonna be pushy.
It's not my way.

25:25.080 --> 25:27.150
May I talk to you for a second?
Excuse us.

25:27.320 --> 25:32.030
Oh, no problem.
I'll just watch the beautiful fish.

25:32.560 --> 25:34.551
I thought you told me
this was a must-sell.

25:34.720 --> 25:37.314
- That's highway robbery.
- What's going on?

25:37.840 --> 25:39.751
Well, they made an offer
and it's not too good.

25:39.920 --> 25:41.592
Sounds good to me. Don't sell.

25:41.760 --> 25:43.034
- Kelly.
- I gotta go.

25:43.200 --> 25:45.509
- Dylan's taking me sailing.
- On a day like this?

25:45.680 --> 25:47.511
Well, it's supposed to clear up. Bye.

25:47.680 --> 25:51.116
All right, have fun.
Take an umbrella, please.

25:51.280 --> 25:53.999
Rob, what should I do?

25:54.160 --> 25:56.720
Well, it's the only offer we've gotten,

25:56.880 --> 26:01.590
and bottom line, a bird in the hand
is worth more than a dead duck.

26:03.920 --> 26:07.276
Okay, so we'll get a little wet.
But it's not gonna kill us.

26:07.440 --> 26:10.000
- I don't know.
- Come on, Kel, it'll be an adventure.

26:10.160 --> 26:11.513
We'll just putter around the harbour.

26:11.680 --> 26:13.591
And besides,
I already rented the boat.

26:13.760 --> 26:15.318
Okay, but I have to warn you,

26:15.480 --> 26:17.994
- I don't know my aft from my elbow.
- Oh, that's okay.

26:18.160 --> 26:21.197
Maybe we'll get swept away
on some deserted island

26:21.360 --> 26:24.432
- and you can be my sex slave.
- ln your dreams.

26:24.880 --> 26:26.199
Every night.

26:33.160 --> 26:34.309
Dylan, come here.

26:35.520 --> 26:38.671
- What?
- Come here, look at this guy.

26:40.400 --> 26:41.913
See that guy?

26:42.480 --> 26:43.515
Yeah, what about him?

26:43.920 --> 26:46.434
- He was staring at me.
- Come on, Kel.

26:46.600 --> 26:48.556
No, I tell you he was looking
right at me.

26:49.480 --> 26:52.472
Kelly, I hate to break it to you,
but guys are gonna look at you.

26:52.640 --> 26:56.189
- It's the price for being so beautiful.
- Dylan.

26:56.360 --> 26:58.078
lf you want,
I'll punch this guy's lights out.

26:58.240 --> 27:00.549
- No. Don't you dare.
- Nobody looks at my woman.

27:00.720 --> 27:02.551
- Would you stop?
- He thinks he can look at you?

27:02.720 --> 27:05.518
- He's a dead man, Kel.
- You are crazy.

27:05.680 --> 27:08.513
- What, you talking to me?
- Yes.

27:15.920 --> 27:17.512
Bran, I don't wanna say I told you so.

27:17.680 --> 27:19.432
- Good.
- But didn't I tell you?

27:19.600 --> 27:22.478
Steve, I lost a couple of games
yesterday. It's no big deal.

27:22.640 --> 27:24.073
How much you lose?
A couple of C-notes?

27:25.200 --> 27:27.156
- Five.
- Five hundred dollars?

27:27.320 --> 27:28.514
You lost five $500?

27:28.680 --> 27:31.752
A little louder, I don't think
the neighbours quite heard that.

27:31.920 --> 27:34.309
- I didn't think you were in that deep.
- Hey, give me a break.

27:34.480 --> 27:36.118
I was up 1500 at one point.

27:36.280 --> 27:39.113
This is a temporary setback,
so lose the dramatics, okay?

27:39.280 --> 27:40.759
Look.

27:40.920 --> 27:43.115
I got a couple bucks on me.

27:43.280 --> 27:44.918
You can go to the ATM
and get the rest later.

27:45.080 --> 27:46.638
- Steve.
- Hey.

27:46.800 --> 27:49.030
This is no time for your
poverty-stricken pride, Brandon.

27:49.200 --> 27:51.589
Steve, don't get me wrong, all right?
I appreciate it.

27:51.760 --> 27:54.593
But a couple of paycheques
will bring me back up to sea level.

27:54.760 --> 27:56.113
Just take this.

27:56.280 --> 27:58.032
Steve--

27:58.200 --> 27:59.428
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, Dad.

27:59.600 --> 28:00.953
- Mr. Walsh.
- What's going on?

28:01.120 --> 28:03.315
- Nothing.
- I gotta go take a shower.

28:03.480 --> 28:06.677
Brandon, next time I tell you
I'm gonna play racquetball,

28:06.840 --> 28:08.956
remind me how bad I am at it,
will you?

28:09.120 --> 28:11.190
You got it.

28:12.440 --> 28:16.513
- Does your old man know about this?
- No. And I'd like to keep it that way.

28:17.840 --> 28:20.229
No. No. No.

28:20.400 --> 28:23.949
No. No. No!

28:24.280 --> 28:26.430
- How was that?
- Well, you had me convinced.

28:26.600 --> 28:28.716
All right, your turn.

28:30.640 --> 28:33.359
No. No. No.

28:33.520 --> 28:35.351
Mom,

28:35.520 --> 28:36.555
centre yourself.

28:36.960 --> 28:40.509
Think about what you would do
if you were really being attacked.

28:41.120 --> 28:42.917
Okay.

28:44.560 --> 28:47.552
No. No. No.

28:47.720 --> 28:52.748
No. No. No. No.

28:52.920 --> 28:54.592
Good job.

28:54.760 --> 28:57.228
Well, I hope I don't meet
either of you in a dark alley.

28:57.400 --> 28:58.469
That was very impressive.

28:58.640 --> 29:00.437
Didn't know I had it in me,
did you, Dad?

29:00.600 --> 29:03.637
Well, now that I do, don't you think
you should wash my car?

29:04.080 --> 29:05.513
- Excuse me?
- Well, you know,

29:06.240 --> 29:09.357
wax on, wax off.

29:09.680 --> 29:12.831
Wax on, wax off.

29:13.960 --> 29:16.633
Come on, <i>The Karate Kid,</i>
You know, the movie?

29:16.800 --> 29:18.472
Jim.

29:18.640 --> 29:21.393
Cute, Dad. Cute. Mom, I'm gonna
get something to drink.

29:21.560 --> 29:23.198
- Do you want anything?
- Oh, no, thanks.

29:23.360 --> 29:27.876
Oh, Jim. Mr. Birnbaum called, he said
to tell you that the papers were ready.

29:28.040 --> 29:29.996
- That was fast.
- Who's Birnbaum?

29:30.160 --> 29:31.229
Business Affairs.

29:31.400 --> 29:34.949
He drew up the final papers
to dissolve Dylan's trust.

29:35.920 --> 29:38.673
Listen, Jim,
I know this wasn't easy for you,

29:38.840 --> 29:41.115
but you did the right thing.

29:41.280 --> 29:42.474
Thanks.

29:42.640 --> 29:44.392
Well, in 48 hours, Mr. Dylan McKay

29:44.560 --> 29:48.109
is going to be an extraordinarily
wealthy young man.

29:53.440 --> 29:55.874
- You got a sec?
- Yeah, I'm just getting ready for work.

29:56.040 --> 29:59.794
I just heard Dad tell Mom,
Dylan's finally getting all of his money.

30:00.800 --> 30:02.631
- Talk about rich.
- Yeah, it's kind of weird.

30:02.800 --> 30:05.314
Dylan was never really into money
and now he's worth a fortune.

30:05.480 --> 30:08.119
Well, at least now I know who I can
hit up for some spare change.

30:08.280 --> 30:10.669
Brandon, what would you do
if you had $10 million.

30:10.840 --> 30:13.149
I don't know.

30:13.640 --> 30:17.633
Pay off some debts, travel,
make a movie, buy the Lakers.

30:17.800 --> 30:20.268
- What about you?
- Do you think it'll change him?

30:20.640 --> 30:23.154
It might. Money has been known
to do that to people.

30:23.320 --> 30:25.231
I think it already has.

30:43.000 --> 30:44.956
Kel.

30:45.560 --> 30:47.437
Now, that I'm gonna be rich,

30:47.600 --> 30:50.558
how will I know if you want me
for my money or my mind?

30:50.720 --> 30:53.029
That's easy.
I want you for your body.

30:53.960 --> 30:55.552
So I'm just like a sex object?

30:55.720 --> 30:57.676
Do you have a problem with that?

30:57.840 --> 31:00.070
Not tonight.

31:04.880 --> 31:06.029
Stay here?

31:06.840 --> 31:09.274
I don't think my mom
would appreciate that very much.

31:09.440 --> 31:11.908
It's okay, I'll write you a note. I will.

31:12.080 --> 31:15.436
You know, "Mrs. Taylor, please excuse
Kelly from being at home tonight,

31:15.600 --> 31:20.958
as she needs a very serious dose
of Dr. McKay's bedside manner."

31:21.960 --> 31:23.871
Nice try, doc,
but you better start operating

31:24.040 --> 31:26.156
because I'm out of here in an hour.

31:26.320 --> 31:28.550
- An hour?
- Yes, an hour.

31:29.080 --> 31:32.038
But it's quality,
not quantity that counts.

31:36.880 --> 31:38.154
I said, no.

31:38.320 --> 31:40.629
- Take your hands off me.
- Good.

31:40.800 --> 31:42.631
You see how assertive she was.

31:42.800 --> 31:46.429
Cindy just showed us that she believes
she doesn't deserve to be harmed.

31:46.600 --> 31:49.876
Self-esteem
is the key to self-defence.

31:52.320 --> 31:54.550
Brenda, you ready?

31:55.240 --> 31:57.071
Okay, start walking away.

31:57.240 --> 32:00.676
- Hey, come here. I just wanna talk.
- No.

32:00.840 --> 32:03.115
Come on.
Just a little friendly conversation.

32:03.280 --> 32:05.635
Back off.

32:07.440 --> 32:10.193
No. No. No.

32:10.360 --> 32:12.874
No. No.

32:13.040 --> 32:16.077
All right, Brenda. That was perfect.

32:17.680 --> 32:20.194
Now, remember the three A's
of self-defence.

32:20.360 --> 32:22.715
Avoidance, awareness
and assertiveness.

32:22.880 --> 32:25.155
Avoid situations
where problems might occur.

32:25.320 --> 32:26.753
Be aware of your surroundings.

32:26.920 --> 32:30.435
And assert yourself
so people know you mean business.

32:41.840 --> 32:43.319
Hey.

32:43.480 --> 32:44.959
Penny for your thoughts.

32:45.120 --> 32:48.874
- You can afford a lot more than that.
- Yeah.

32:49.040 --> 32:50.473
- Where's Kelly?
- Oh, I took her home.

32:50.640 --> 32:52.278
We were both,
you know, pretty tired.

32:54.880 --> 32:56.518
Dylan.

32:56.680 --> 32:58.636
I know I didn't discuss this
with you or anything,

32:58.800 --> 33:01.030
but this thing with Christine,
are you all right with that?

33:01.200 --> 33:04.749
Oh, yeah. I mean, I'm great with that.
I just--

33:04.920 --> 33:06.433
I'm really happy for you.

33:06.600 --> 33:08.750
Good. Good, I'm glad.

33:09.520 --> 33:11.556
You know, there's so much that--

33:14.800 --> 33:16.836
There's so many things
I wish I could tell you.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.514
Jack, any time
you wanna talk to me...

33:19.680 --> 33:22.194
Well, I can't tell you everything
right now. At least--

33:22.760 --> 33:24.796
At least not--

33:24.960 --> 33:26.473
You know, at least not all of it.

33:26.840 --> 33:29.035
<i>It's okay, how about just the first part,</i>
<i>you know?</i>

33:29.200 --> 33:32.078
<i>Jack McKay, the early years,</i>

33:33.200 --> 33:36.237
I think we better interrupt
this bedtime story.

33:36.400 --> 33:39.517
To get ahead in this world, sometimes
you gotta get down and dirty.

33:39.680 --> 33:41.591
You gotta roll in the mud
with the pigs.

33:41.920 --> 33:45.515
So, what are you telling me,
that you know a couple of bad guys?

33:45.680 --> 33:48.069
Yeah. Yeah, a couple.

33:50.200 --> 33:52.350
Dylan, there is something that--

33:52.520 --> 33:55.432
Well, something I haven't exactly
been 100 percent clear about with you.

33:55.600 --> 33:57.830
And I just wanted to talk to you
about that.

33:58.000 --> 34:02.073
Excuse me, Mr. McKay.
Can I speak to you for a moment?

34:02.240 --> 34:03.559
Can it wait?

34:04.400 --> 34:07.597
- Afraid not.
- Hey, it's okay.

34:07.760 --> 34:09.351
I'm not going anywhere.

34:17.880 --> 34:19.916
I thought you understood
how this was gonna be played.

34:20.080 --> 34:21.195
What are you talking about?

34:21.360 --> 34:23.157
I'm talking about
keeping your mouth shut.

34:23.320 --> 34:25.117
Look, I can't keep lying to him.

34:25.280 --> 34:26.838
I've gotta tell him what's going on.

34:27.000 --> 34:28.558
Let me assure you,

34:28.719 --> 34:31.632
if you say one word to your son
about our little arrangement,

34:31.800 --> 34:34.393
I doubt if either one of you
will come out of this thing alive.

34:50.280 --> 34:51.759
Hey, David, can I get you anything?

34:51.920 --> 34:54.228
Oh, no, thanks, Nat.
I'm just waiting for Donna.

34:54.400 --> 34:57.198
Well, then maybe
I should charge you rent.

35:06.640 --> 35:07.629
Steve.

35:15.200 --> 35:18.909
Steve, would you just listen to me
for a second, please?

35:19.080 --> 35:20.832
I'm listening.

35:21.000 --> 35:22.638
Look, I know it was wrong
to dump you, okay?

35:22.800 --> 35:25.360
But lcon Records
is a cutthroat operation.

35:25.520 --> 35:26.794
And I have to do what they say

35:26.960 --> 35:29.872
until they make me a huge
enough star, so they do what I say.

35:30.280 --> 35:31.952
And who taught you that?

35:33.120 --> 35:34.109
You did.

35:36.920 --> 35:38.114
Don't you forget it.

35:39.200 --> 35:40.235
So you don't hate me?

35:41.200 --> 35:43.191
Show business is a dirty game.

35:43.360 --> 35:44.873
You did what you gotta do.

35:45.040 --> 35:48.396
But when you get huge,
I want tickets.

35:48.560 --> 35:51.279
And I get good tickets.
And don't expect me to pay for them.

35:59.320 --> 36:01.436
Hey, Duke. How's it going?

36:01.600 --> 36:02.589
Can't complain.

36:02.760 --> 36:04.910
Yeah, I can. But I won't.

36:05.520 --> 36:07.317
Have a seat.
Brandon will be right with you.

36:09.840 --> 36:12.195
Hey, Duke.
Didn't know you'd be coming by today.

36:12.360 --> 36:14.430
Taking care of a little business
in the neighbourhood.

36:14.600 --> 36:15.715
Great, what can I get you?

36:15.880 --> 36:17.552
I think you know.

36:20.280 --> 36:23.875
Listen, Duke,
I came up a little short this week.

36:24.040 --> 36:27.032
A few bets didn't come in
the way I thought they would.

36:27.200 --> 36:29.589
Can you give me a couple of days?
I'm good for it.

36:30.800 --> 36:34.588
I like you, kid.
You're a hard worker, good gambler.

36:34.760 --> 36:36.955
Two things I have a high respect for.

36:37.520 --> 36:40.830
- Thanks.
- So I'm gonna let you slide this time.

36:41.320 --> 36:44.471
- Oh, that's great. Thanks, Duke.
- Don't worry about it.

36:44.640 --> 36:47.108
Everybody has a bad run
now and again.

36:47.280 --> 36:48.838
Yeah, tell me about it.

36:49.000 --> 36:50.991
But I want you to know one thing,
kid.

36:51.160 --> 36:53.674
So listen to me now,
and listen to me good.

36:54.120 --> 36:56.190
You know how many times
I let my clients off the hook

36:56.360 --> 36:58.874
for a little margin of error?

37:05.080 --> 37:07.275
Nice to see you.

37:13.600 --> 37:15.113
Where's Duke?

37:15.280 --> 37:18.431
He had a little business to take care of
in the neighbourhood.

37:18.960 --> 37:21.190
Are you okay, pal?

37:21.360 --> 37:24.477
Yeah, sure. Couldn't be better.

37:36.760 --> 37:39.672
Well, I talked to Steve
and he gave me his blessings.

37:39.840 --> 37:42.400
Well, that's good, I guess.

37:42.560 --> 37:45.757
Well, after what I did I thought he was
gonna hate me for the rest of his life.

37:45.920 --> 37:49.515
Steve's not the kind to hold a grudge.
Unlike some people I know.

37:50.440 --> 37:52.715
- Hi, guys.
- Hello.

37:52.880 --> 37:54.552
So are we homeless yet?

37:54.720 --> 37:56.870
Nope, I turned down the offer.

37:57.040 --> 37:59.474
- Good for you.
- I hope I did the right thing.

37:59.640 --> 38:02.393
What if we don't get any more?
The market's so bad right now.

38:02.800 --> 38:03.789
You will.

38:03.960 --> 38:05.951
And until then, we can help you out.

38:06.120 --> 38:07.872
Thank you.

38:08.040 --> 38:10.395
Thank you both.

38:11.520 --> 38:14.512
And thank you, Erin.

38:15.200 --> 38:19.591
You know, we got ourselves
a wonderful little family here.

38:29.360 --> 38:30.349
Yeah?

38:31.960 --> 38:34.474
- Hey.
- Hey.

38:35.600 --> 38:36.953
I may not see you in the morning.

38:37.120 --> 38:39.918
I gotta get up early and go to town,
take care of some business.

38:40.080 --> 38:42.275
- What business?
- Just some old contacts, that's all.

38:42.440 --> 38:44.192
I just wanna make sure
they know I'm alive.

38:44.360 --> 38:46.510
Yeah.

38:47.840 --> 38:50.195
Oh, no, no, no, no. Come on, Dylan.

38:50.360 --> 38:53.272
Come on. I already told you,
I only mingle with the good guys now.

38:53.440 --> 38:58.639
Yeah. Well, I gotta get some z's
or I'm gonna be a zombie tomorrow.

38:59.920 --> 39:01.273
You remember what I used to do,

39:01.960 --> 39:04.190
when you were a kid
and you couldn't fall asleep?

39:04.720 --> 39:06.756
Yeah.

39:08.240 --> 39:09.434
Don't you dare.

39:09.600 --> 39:13.593
- <i>Take me out to the ball game</i>
- Please, don't do this to me, Jack.

39:13.760 --> 39:16.399
- <i>Take me out to the crowd</i>
- This is why I hate baseball, okay?

39:16.560 --> 39:19.870
- <i>Buy me peanuts and Cracker Jacks</i>
- You did this to me. I'm scarred here.

39:20.040 --> 39:22.679
- I have physical and emotional--
- <i>I don't care if I never get back</i>

39:22.840 --> 39:27.038
- Jack, you're driving me nuts.
- <i>So root, root, root for the home team</i>

39:27.200 --> 39:30.112
- <i>If they don't win, it's a shame</i>
- I am trapped with a tone-deaf lunatic.

39:30.280 --> 39:31.918
- <i>Well, it's one, two</i>
- Anybody, hey.

39:32.080 --> 39:35.675
<i>Three strikes you're out</i>
<i>At the old ball game</i>

39:35.880 --> 39:37.632
You're nuts, man.

40:29.000 --> 40:31.468
Who said it never rains in California?

40:31.640 --> 40:32.629
Not me.

40:33.200 --> 40:35.191
Don't forget to tell your dad
to move his car.

40:35.360 --> 40:37.157
There's no parking
in the lot on Monday mornings

40:37.320 --> 40:41.074
and the meter maids
give out tickets rain or shine.

40:41.240 --> 40:42.912
Thanks. I'll do it myself.

40:58.960 --> 41:01.349
Yeah, how you doing?

41:01.520 --> 41:03.351
Wait a minute.

41:04.400 --> 41:06.675
No, I don't see him, Kelly.
Hang on a second.

41:06.840 --> 41:10.150
- You seen Dylan?
- I'm not even awake yet.

41:10.320 --> 41:12.276
Let me check outside, Kel.

41:18.320 --> 41:19.309
Dylan.

41:19.880 --> 41:22.314
- You looking for your kid?
- Yeah.

41:22.480 --> 41:23.879
He's moving your car.

41:34.840 --> 41:35.829
Dylan.

41:36.000 --> 41:37.035
Yeah?

41:55.920 --> 41:58.150
- Kelly.
- Oh, well, I could've called her back.

41:58.320 --> 42:01.198
Hey, take it from me, don't ever keep
a girl you care about waiting.

42:01.680 --> 42:03.591
- I was gonna move the car.
- It's okay. I'll get it.

42:03.760 --> 42:04.749
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

42:04.920 --> 42:07.036
- Thanks, Dad.
- Well, hey, what are dads for, huh?

42:07.200 --> 42:09.236
Umbrellas.

42:09.400 --> 42:11.960
- Hey, how you doing?
- I just wanted to say good morning.

42:12.120 --> 42:14.315
- <i>Good morning,</i>
- How did you sleep?

42:14.480 --> 42:16.596
Not as good as if you'd been here.

42:18.240 --> 42:21.073
That's me. Hold on.

42:21.880 --> 42:23.836
Hello?

42:24.400 --> 42:26.834
Yeah, hold on.

42:27.760 --> 42:29.910
Dylan, I have to go.
That's my mom's realtor.

42:30.080 --> 42:33.277
Okay. Listen, I'll see you in school.

42:36.400 --> 42:37.515
Dad!

42:38.080 --> 42:39.433
Jack!
