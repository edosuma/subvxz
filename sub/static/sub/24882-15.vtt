00:22.533 --> 00:25.433
Oh. See this, uh,
friendship bracelet
Rosita made me?

00:25.433 --> 00:27.033
- Mm-hmm.

00:27.033 --> 00:28.166
- I'm gonna make you one.

00:28.166 --> 00:30.000
- Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

00:30.000 --> 00:32.066
Yeah. Okay. Okay.

00:32.066 --> 00:34.233
Braid a string
from end to end.

00:34.233 --> 00:36.767
Show Rosita
she's my friend.

00:36.767 --> 00:38.567
Zippity zap!

00:38.567 --> 00:41.066
- Oh, wow!
- I guess I like you a lot.

00:41.066 --> 00:42.967

Ha ha ha!

01:17.133 --> 01:18.934
- Ha ha ha!
- Oh! Come on, Rosita!

01:18.934 --> 01:20.967
- Wait for me!
- Hi, Big Bird!

01:20.967 --> 01:22.200
Hi, Big Bird!

01:22.200 --> 01:24.166
Oh, hi, Elmo.
Hi, Rosita.

01:24.166 --> 01:28.133
Oh. Hello there,
and welcome to Sesame Street.

01:28.133 --> 01:31.000
I'm so glad you're here
because today is

01:31.000 --> 01:34.033
a very special day
because my pen pal

01:34.033 --> 01:36.100
from India is coming
to visit!

01:36.100 --> 01:37.333
Ha ha ha!

01:37.333 --> 01:41.200
A welcome sign
for little old me?

01:41.200 --> 01:44.133
Aww. How thoughtful,
Big Bird.

01:44.133 --> 01:45.300
Oh, Grover.

01:45.300 --> 01:47.166
You're always welcome
at my nest,

01:47.166 --> 01:50.400
but this sign is
for my pen pal.

01:50.400 --> 01:53.066
Oh. Oh, I do not have
a pen pal.

01:53.066 --> 01:54.500
I am good buddies
with this crayon, though.

01:54.500 --> 01:57.066
His name is Steve.
Steve, Big Bird.

01:57.066 --> 01:58.533
- Big Bird, Steve.
- Hello, Steve.

01:58.533 --> 02:01.333
Actually, Grover, a pen pal
is someone who lives

02:01.333 --> 02:04.233
far, far away,
so you become friends

02:04.233 --> 02:06.567
by writing letters
to one another.

02:06.567 --> 02:07.934
Ohh.

02:07.934 --> 02:09.834
That kind of pen pal.
Ha ha ha!

02:09.834 --> 02:12.333
Yeah, and even though
we live in different countries,

02:12.333 --> 02:14.800
my pen pal and I have
a lot in common,

02:14.800 --> 02:18.166
and today, she's flying here
all the way from India

02:18.166 --> 02:19.734
so we can meet!

02:19.734 --> 02:22.734
She is flying
here today?

02:22.734 --> 02:24.100
Did you hear that, Steve?

02:24.100 --> 02:26.100
Oh, this is going to be
so exciting!

02:26.100 --> 02:27.266
It sure is.

02:27.266 --> 02:28.433
I just want my pen pal

02:28.433 --> 02:30.000
to feel welcome
and have fun.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.633
Do not worry,
Big Bird.

02:31.633 --> 02:33.834
I will help you get
everything ready.

02:33.834 --> 02:36.767
Help? Oh, but--
but everything is ready
already, uh, Grover.

02:36.767 --> 02:38.900
- I just need to color
in this sign, and then--
- Yes, yes, yes.

02:38.900 --> 02:41.934
You do that,
and I will take care
of everything else.

02:41.934 --> 02:43.934
But everything--
everything else?

02:43.934 --> 02:45.033
- Ha ha ha!
- Yeah-eah!

02:45.033 --> 02:46.300
Okay, Elmo.
Go, go, go.

02:46.300 --> 02:48.066
Oh, yeah, baby.
Throw Elmo the ball!

02:48.066 --> 02:49.300
Throw Elmo the ball,
Rosita.

02:49.300 --> 02:52.000
- Hey, everybody!

02:52.000 --> 02:53.834
Attention, please!

02:53.834 --> 02:57.066
Today, Big Bird's friend
is flying here from India,

02:57.066 --> 02:59.133
and we need to make sure
she feels welcome.

02:59.133 --> 03:01.333
Ooh.
Is she a bird, too?

03:01.333 --> 03:04.000
Well, of course
she is a bird.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.066
- I just told you she is
flying here, didn't I?
- Yeah.

03:07.066 --> 03:10.033
If she's flying
all the way from India,

03:10.033 --> 03:12.000
she might be hungry
when she gets here.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.800
Good point, Rosita!

03:13.800 --> 03:14.934
We can help her
feel welcome

03:14.934 --> 03:15.967
by giving her
something to eat.

03:15.967 --> 03:17.533
- Yes.
- Hey, hey, hey!

03:17.533 --> 03:19.266
Oh. Elmo has an idea.

03:19.266 --> 03:21.200
- Elmo will be right back.
- Yeah, sure.

03:21.200 --> 03:22.800
Oh! Look, everybody.
Look, look.

03:22.800 --> 03:27.100
Elmo has a birdfeeder,
you know, to feed the birdie.

03:27.100 --> 03:29.834
Oh! That's a great idea,
Elmo.

03:29.834 --> 03:31.400
- Thank you.
- But, Elmo.

03:31.400 --> 03:33.967
- Me think that might
be too small.

03:33.967 --> 03:36.700
- Oh.
- Oh, that's right.

03:36.700 --> 03:40.934
She probably has a great
big beak like Big Bird's.

03:40.934 --> 03:43.033
Then we will build
a bigger birdfeeder

03:43.033 --> 03:45.133
for a bigger bird, sure.

03:47.834 --> 03:51.934
Well, our birdfeeder has
a certain rustic charm.

03:51.934 --> 03:53.500
Elmo thinks
it's gonna fall down.

03:53.500 --> 03:56.500
- Uh, hello.
Oh, hello.

03:56.500 --> 03:57.700
Oh, hello.

03:57.700 --> 03:59.033
Hi. My name is Chamki.

03:59.033 --> 04:01.400
Oh, hi! Oh.
Elmo is Elmo.

04:01.400 --> 04:03.767
Yeah.  Hola!
I'm Rosita.

04:03.767 --> 04:05.066
Me Cookie Monster.

04:05.066 --> 04:06.934
Yes, and I am Grover.

04:06.934 --> 04:08.300
Nice to meet you all.

04:08.300 --> 04:11.066
Can you tell me how to get
to Sesame Street?

04:11.066 --> 04:12.467
Oh, yeah.
You see, you just--

04:12.467 --> 04:14.066
Wait a minute.
You here. This Sesame Street.

04:14.066 --> 04:15.133
- Yeah, yeah.
- Cookie Monster.

04:15.133 --> 04:18.467
This is Sesame Street?

04:18.467 --> 04:20.333
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

04:20.333 --> 04:21.266
Wow!

04:21.266 --> 04:23.934
It's exactly
how I imagined it.

04:23.934 --> 04:25.166
Ha ha ha!

04:25.166 --> 04:27.500
- Uh, except--

04:27.500 --> 04:29.133
Except for this,

04:29.133 --> 04:33.266
this funny-looking
spaceship right here.

04:33.266 --> 04:36.066
Oh, oh. Yeah.
That not a spaceship.

04:36.066 --> 04:38.033
That a birdfeeder.

04:38.033 --> 04:39.266
Yeah. We're building it
for a bird

04:39.266 --> 04:40.967
who's coming here
from India.

04:40.967 --> 04:42.133
That's right.

04:44.133 --> 04:46.166
- I'm from India, too!
!

04:46.166 --> 04:48.467
Well, if Chamki
is from India,

04:48.467 --> 04:52.100
maybe Chamki can help
the birdie feel more welcome.

04:52.100 --> 04:54.100
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, yes!

04:54.100 --> 04:55.700
That'd be so much fun!

04:55.700 --> 04:57.100
I'd love to help!

04:57.100 --> 04:59.133
Excellent!
Then tell me,

04:59.133 --> 05:02.734
what kind of birdseed
do you have in India?

05:02.734 --> 05:05.533
Uh, I'm not sure.

05:05.533 --> 05:08.033
Maybe the same kind
that you have here.

05:08.033 --> 05:10.300
In that case...

05:10.300 --> 05:11.967
lunch is served!

05:11.967 --> 05:14.200
Hope everybody likes
birdseed.

05:14.200 --> 05:20.066
Oh, Grover, birdseed
is great for the bird,

05:20.066 --> 05:23.033
but I want to eat paratha!

05:23.033 --> 05:25.133
- Oh.
- Let's see.

05:25.133 --> 05:26.533
Grover:
Can't wait to see this.

05:27.934 --> 05:29.066
Ha ha ha!

05:29.066 --> 05:33.867
And this is called
a paratha.

05:33.867 --> 05:35.600
All:
Paratha.

05:35.600 --> 05:37.000
Grover:
Ho ho ho!

05:37.000 --> 05:38.367
It's one
of my favorites,

05:38.367 --> 05:41.400
so I brought lots
of them to share!

05:41.400 --> 05:43.033
- Oh, ho ho!
- Oh, boy!

05:43.033 --> 05:45.467
You know what?
In Mexican culture,

05:45.467 --> 05:48.567
we eat something that
looks kind of like that.

05:48.567 --> 05:50.233
Let me show you.

05:50.233 --> 05:52.000
♪ Ya da da da ♪

05:52.000 --> 05:54.533
Okay.
These are tortillas.

05:54.533 --> 05:57.433
- Grover: Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

05:57.433 --> 05:59.633
- Yeah. Look.
- They're both flatbread.

05:59.633 --> 06:01.200
Yeah.

06:01.200 --> 06:05.033
And they both round
like a cookie.

06:05.033 --> 06:06.100
Mmm!

06:09.400 --> 06:11.066
Cookie.

06:11.066 --> 06:13.900
I brought lots
of parathas for everyone

06:13.900 --> 06:16.066
if you guys want to try.

06:16.066 --> 06:17.934
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

06:17.934 --> 06:19.266
That's great!
Thank you, Chamki!

06:19.266 --> 06:21.200
Rosita:
She's so generous. Yummy.

06:21.200 --> 06:23.166
Thanks for sharing,
Chamki.

06:23.166 --> 06:25.200
Paratha is yummy.

06:25.200 --> 06:27.900
Really?
Thanks, Rosita.

06:27.900 --> 06:29.900
Tortillas
are really yummy, too.

06:29.900 --> 06:32.433
- Aww.
- Ha ha ha!

06:32.433 --> 06:34.066
- Uh-oh!
What's up?

06:34.066 --> 06:36.100
I-- I just remembered.

06:36.100 --> 06:38.100
This has been a lot
of fun, guys,

06:38.100 --> 06:40.500
but I was actually on my way
to meet a friend.

06:40.500 --> 06:43.166
Uh, I guess I should
get going now.

06:43.166 --> 06:45.100
No, no, no, wait.
We still need your help.

06:45.100 --> 06:46.567
- Yeah.
- Yes.

06:46.567 --> 06:48.367
Please tell us more things
about India

06:48.367 --> 06:52.000
so Big Bird's friend
will feel welcome.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.200
Oh. Did you just say
"Big Bird"?

06:55.200 --> 06:57.166
Big Bird:
I finished the sign,

06:57.166 --> 07:02.133
so-- so if anybody sees--
Chamki!

07:02.133 --> 07:04.300
Big Bird!

07:04.300 --> 07:07.066
Oh, I'm so happy
to finally meet you.

07:07.066 --> 07:09.000
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Me, too!

07:09.000 --> 07:11.600
Hold on.
Elmo's confused.

07:11.600 --> 07:12.734
Yeah, me, too.

07:12.734 --> 07:14.166
How do you two
know each other?

07:14.166 --> 07:16.266
Well, Chamki is
the pen pal

07:16.266 --> 07:18.166
I was telling you about,
Grover.

07:18.166 --> 07:20.100
- But-- but wait.

07:20.100 --> 07:22.900
We all thought your friend
was a bird.

07:22.900 --> 07:24.367
Yeah.

07:24.367 --> 07:26.333
You're the one who said
she was flying here,

07:26.333 --> 07:28.266
that you had
a lot in common.

07:28.266 --> 07:30.700
( Chamki and Big Bird
laughing )

07:30.700 --> 07:35.066
Oh! I did fly here,
but on an airplane!

07:35.066 --> 07:36.834
Ha ha ha!

07:36.834 --> 07:38.967
All: Ohh.

07:38.967 --> 07:40.500
And we do have
a lot in common.

07:40.500 --> 07:42.266
We like a lot
of the same things,

07:42.266 --> 07:45.333
like helping our friends
and learning new things and--

07:45.333 --> 07:47.433
And playing games
and dancing.

07:47.433 --> 07:49.834
You know, friends
don't have to look the same

07:49.834 --> 07:52.200
or be from the same country
to have a lot in common.

07:52.200 --> 07:54.767
- That's right.
- Chamki, come on.

07:54.767 --> 07:56.000
Let me show you around.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.667
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

07:57.667 --> 07:59.133
Oh, come on, guys.

07:59.133 --> 08:01.433
- Okay.
- Here we are.

08:01.433 --> 08:04.133
Welcome to my home,
Chamki.

08:04.133 --> 08:06.967
Whoa! It's wonderful!

08:06.967 --> 08:08.467
Thank you, Big Bird.

08:08.467 --> 08:11.133
I love the sign
you made for me so much!

08:11.133 --> 08:13.133
Does it make you
feel welcome?

08:13.133 --> 08:15.000
It sure does,

08:15.000 --> 08:17.300
and you know what else
makes me feel welcome?

08:17.300 --> 08:18.867
- Grover: Ho ho ho!

08:18.867 --> 08:21.400
All your friends
on Sesame Street!

08:21.400 --> 08:24.667
Yeah.
Thanks, everybody.

08:24.667 --> 08:27.266
So what else are you
going to do while
you're here, Chamki?

08:27.266 --> 08:30.934
Well, Big Bird and I,
we both like to learn
new things,

08:30.934 --> 08:33.233
especially dancing,

08:33.233 --> 08:36.967
so we were planning
to teach each other
a new dance.

08:36.967 --> 08:38.600
Yeah. Oh, since
you're all here,

08:38.600 --> 08:40.000
do you want to dance, too?

08:40.000 --> 08:42.200
- Yes!
- Absolutely! Yes!

08:42.200 --> 08:43.867
Me bust a move!

08:43.867 --> 08:46.934
Great. So why don't we do
the bird dance that we learned

08:46.934 --> 08:48.767
from my Granny Bird,
the flappy dance?

08:48.767 --> 08:50.033
Remember that one?

08:50.033 --> 08:51.567
Okay, Chamki.

08:51.567 --> 08:54.000
You just flap your arms
like wings and sing with us.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.166
- Okay.

08:55.166 --> 08:56.834
1, 2, 3, 4!

08:56.834 --> 08:59.834
All:
♪ Flappy, flap, flap,
flappy, flap, flap ♪

08:59.834 --> 09:02.367
♪ Spinny, spin, spin,
and clappy, clap, clap ♪

09:02.367 --> 09:03.433
Again!

09:03.433 --> 09:04.967

Nothing is better

Because nothing
beats friendship

Friends can be furry,
friends can love food,

friends can be funny

Friends make things better.

13:03.133 --> 13:06.200
They know just how you feel,

13:06.200 --> 13:08.500
and the best kind of friend

13:08.500 --> 13:11.100
knows all feelings are real.

13:12.934 --> 13:16.834
And even though friends
may sometimes get in a fight,

13:16.834 --> 13:21.367
a hug or "I'm sorry"
can make most things right.

13:23.166 --> 13:27.767

18:39.967 --> 18:41.934
The number of the day

18:41.934 --> 18:45.100
- Aw.

18:45.100 --> 18:47.033
And it isn't 0.

18:47.033 --> 18:50.066

18:50.066 --> 18:52.533
The number of the day

Woji bona, you have 10?

19:08.100 --> 19:11.000
Both: No 10!

19:11.000 --> 19:12.533
Wait, wait, wait.

19:12.533 --> 19:16.367

next to each other!

19:16.367 --> 19:18.433

20:44.433 --> 20:48.700
Oh! Guess what Elmo is
wondering about today.

20:48.700 --> 20:50.667
Wait for it.

20:50.667 --> 20:53.333
Wai-ai-ait for it.

20:55.033 --> 20:58.333
Boy, he looks sad.

20:58.333 --> 21:02.133
Oh, but a friend is
giving him a flower.

21:02.133 --> 21:03.667
Oh, ho ho! Oh, boy.

21:05.600 --> 21:08.066
Kindness! Yeah!

21:08.066 --> 21:10.266
Ooh! Elmo wants
to find out more.

21:10.266 --> 21:14.667
Hey-ey! Let's ask
Elmo's friend, Smartie!

21:14.667 --> 21:16.000
Let's ask her together.

21:16.000 --> 21:19.100
Elmo and kids:
Oh, Smartie!

21:22.000 --> 21:23.767
I'm here.
Here I am!

21:23.767 --> 21:26.000
Oh, ho ho ho!
Hi, Smartie!

21:26.000 --> 21:27.200
Hiya, Elmo.

21:27.200 --> 21:29.433
Why is Smartie
facing backwards?

21:29.433 --> 21:31.700
Because I didn't
want to ruin the surprise.

21:31.700 --> 21:32.967
Surprise!

21:32.967 --> 21:34.033
Ha ha ha!

21:34.033 --> 21:35.166
I drew a picture of us.

21:35.166 --> 21:37.133
Elmo loves
that, Smartie!

21:37.133 --> 21:39.400
Boy, that's so kind.

21:39.400 --> 21:42.767
Oh, and that's exactly
why Elmo called.

21:42.767 --> 21:46.400
Elmo wants to learn
more about kindness.

21:46.400 --> 21:48.333
Well, what do we
do to learn something new?

21:48.333 --> 21:51.633
All:
We look it up!

21:53.066 --> 21:54.800
Smartie:
Let's see.

21:54.800 --> 21:57.266
Searching for kindness.

21:57.266 --> 22:00.233
Kindness is doing nice
things to show you care.

22:00.233 --> 22:03.700
There are lots of
ways to be kind,

22:03.700 --> 22:07.033
like taking turns

22:07.033 --> 22:09.133
or sharing

22:09.133 --> 22:11.100
or showing that you care
by helping clean up

22:11.100 --> 22:14.633
and taking care
of the environment,

22:14.633 --> 22:18.133
or my personal favorite,
giving hugs.

22:19.567 --> 22:22.233
Oh, ho ho ho!
That's Elmo's favorite, too!

22:22.233 --> 22:25.033
Oh, thank you
for your help, Smartie.

22:25.033 --> 22:26.467
You're welcome, Elmo.

22:26.467 --> 22:28.967
Well, I'm off to volunteer
at the old phones home.

22:28.967 --> 22:32.133
Aw.
That's so kind of you.

22:32.133 --> 22:34.166
Yeah. I really
get a charge from it.

22:34.166 --> 22:35.900
Ha ha ha!

22:35.900 --> 22:37.633
Thank you, Smartie.
Bye-bye.

22:37.633 --> 22:39.000
Ha ha ha!

22:39.000 --> 22:43.066
Hey! That gives
Elmo an idea.

22:43.066 --> 22:45.100
Oh. Let's play
a game together.

22:45.100 --> 22:46.600
Yeah!

22:46.600 --> 22:48.100
Come on, come on.

22:48.100 --> 22:49.400
Ha ha ha!

22:54.834 --> 22:59.133
Hey! Let's do something
kind for Dorothy.

22:59.133 --> 23:02.100
Oh. Let's help
Dorothy find her food.

23:02.100 --> 23:03.367
Kid:
Go! Go up!

23:03.367 --> 23:05.000
Kid #2:
Yeah, up!

23:05.000 --> 23:06.667
Kid #3:
Go up, Dorothy!

23:06.667 --> 23:10.000
Elmo:
Great! Now which way
should Dorothy go?

23:10.000 --> 23:11.166
Kid: Go down.

23:11.166 --> 23:13.066
Kid #2:
Yeah, down!

23:13.066 --> 23:14.500
Too far!

23:14.500 --> 23:18.200
Elmo:
Uh-oh! Dorothy went too far.

23:18.200 --> 23:20.967
Kid:
Go back, Dorothy.

23:20.967 --> 23:23.166
Kid #2:
Now go up!

23:23.166 --> 23:25.133
Elmo:
That's it! Keep going!

23:25.133 --> 23:27.667
- Dorothy did it!

23:27.667 --> 23:30.500
Oh, and it looks like
Dorothy sure was hungry.

23:30.500 --> 23:34.033
Oh, ho ho! Bye-bye,
Dorothy.

23:34.033 --> 23:36.300
Oh, boy. Elmo loves
to help his friends.

23:36.300 --> 23:40.066
That's one of Elmo's
favorite ways to be kind.

23:40.066 --> 23:41.567
Hey!

23:41.567 --> 23:46.967
Elmo wonders-- what does
Mr. Noodle do to be kind?

23:46.967 --> 23:48.300
Hey. Let's go ask him.

23:48.300 --> 23:52.233
♪ Oh, Mr. Noodle ♪

23:52.233 --> 23:55.467
Hey-ey!

Mr. Noodle.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.967

Hi, Mr. Noodle.

23:58.967 --> 24:02.133
Elmo:
Oh. Mr. Noodle,
what are your favorite ways

24:02.133 --> 24:03.266
to be kind?

24:05.166 --> 24:07.867
Kid:
Hey. That's juggling.

24:07.867 --> 24:10.867
Elmo:
Oh! Elmo thinks you're
a great juggler, but--

24:10.867 --> 24:12.700
Kids:
That's not being kind.

24:12.700 --> 24:14.967
Elmo:
Oh. Well, you got it?
Okay. What?

24:14.967 --> 24:16.533
Oh, ho ho ho!

24:16.533 --> 24:18.533
Kid:
Hey. He's dancing
with a ribbon.

24:18.533 --> 24:21.667
Elmo:
Mr. Noodle,
that's not being kind either.

24:21.667 --> 24:23.500
What

24:23.500 --> 24:25.734
Kid:
Look at that!
He's doing a card trick.

24:25.734 --> 24:27.734
Elmo:
Oh, that's very nice,
Mr. Noodle.

24:27.734 --> 24:31.133
Uh-huh. Very nice, but,
you know, that's a-- that's

24:31.133 --> 24:33.300
an impressive trick,
but, Mr. Noodle,

24:33.300 --> 24:35.000

What? Oh, boy.
