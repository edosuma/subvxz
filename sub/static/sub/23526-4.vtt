00:00.734 --> 00:01.969
<b>- Previously</b>
<b>on "All Stars..."</b>

00:02.069 --> 00:03.670
<b>- I think I would have</b>
<b>chosen Thorgy to stay.</b>

00:03.770 --> 00:08.075
<b>I find Thorgy's concepts</b>
<b>much more exciting.</b>

00:08.175 --> 00:10.410
<b>- [bleep] my drag, right?</b>

00:10.511 --> 00:14.314
<b>- You'll be improv-ing your way</b>
<b>through "The Bitchelor."</b>

00:14.414 --> 00:15.883
<b>- Ooh, you is fine.</b>

00:15.983 --> 00:17.518
<b>- [laughs]</b>
<b>- Thank you.</b>

00:17.618 --> 00:20.187
<b>- Have you ever</b>
<b>taken out a catheter?</b>

00:20.287 --> 00:21.188
<b>- Aja.</b>

00:21.288 --> 00:22.956
<b>- I didn't get needy girl.</b>

00:23.056 --> 00:24.358
<b>- Oh, my God.</b>
<b>- At all.</b>

00:24.458 --> 00:26.226
<b>- Chi Chi DeVayne.</b>

00:26.326 --> 00:28.462
<b>- You were constantly</b>
<b>overshadowed.</b>

00:28.562 --> 00:31.031
<b>- Milk.</b>
<b>- You were going so fast--</b>

00:31.131 --> 00:32.199
<b>- I can't handle it</b>
<b>right now!</b>

00:32.299 --> 00:34.735
<b>- You weren't sharing</b>
<b>the stage.</b>

00:34.835 --> 00:37.905
<b>- Kennedy Davenport,</b>
<b>you're a winner, baby.</b>

00:38.005 --> 00:40.641
<b>- Whoo!</b>
<b>[applause]</b>

00:40.741 --> 00:44.611
<b>- Which queen have you chosen</b>
<b>to get the chop?</b>

00:44.711 --> 00:47.447
<b>- I had to think about</b>
<b>everything that was going on,</b>

00:47.548 --> 00:51.385
<b>on and off screen</b>
<b>to make my decision,</b>

00:51.485 --> 00:52.786
<b>so I chose...</b>

00:55.155 --> 00:56.690
<b>Milk.</b>

00:57.724 --> 01:00.894
<b>- Milk, sashay away.</b>

01:10.469 --> 01:12.104
<b>- Ooh, Lord.</b>

01:12.204 --> 01:13.406
<b>- Oh, my God.</b>

01:13.506 --> 01:16.475
<b>"Love you girls,</b>
<b>but y'all know--"</b>

01:16.576 --> 01:18.611
<b>- "This is bogus."</b>
<b>- Bogus?</b>

01:18.711 --> 01:20.346
<b>[chuckles]</b>

01:20.446 --> 01:21.647
<b>- The girls</b>
<b>are getting mighty shady</b>

01:21.747 --> 01:23.783
<b>with the mirror this season,</b>
<b>aren't they?</b>

01:23.883 --> 01:25.952
<b>First I got told to suck it.</b>

01:26.052 --> 01:29.288
<b>Now Kennedy is getting told</b>
<b>that her decision is bogus.</b>

01:29.388 --> 01:30.923
<b>- That was shady,</b>
<b>but all right.</b>

01:31.023 --> 01:32.191
<b>Bitch, please.</b>

01:32.291 --> 01:37.063
<b>How is it bogus if you</b>
<b>are getting bad critiques?</b>

01:37.163 --> 01:39.232
<b>Let me go on and say</b>
<b>why I did what I did.</b>

01:39.332 --> 01:43.002
<b>Like the judges,</b>
<b>I just wasn't enthused at all.</b>

01:43.102 --> 01:45.805
<b>On a personal note,</b>
<b>I couldn't relate to Milk,</b>

01:45.905 --> 01:48.908
<b>and then for her to sit and say</b>
<b>that she would've sent me home,</b>

01:49.008 --> 01:50.243
<b>that hurt my feelings.</b>

01:50.343 --> 01:52.645
<b>- I totally understand</b>
<b>where she's coming from.</b>

01:52.745 --> 01:55.381
<b>If someone tried</b>
<b>to devalidate my drag,</b>

01:55.481 --> 01:56.649
<b>I would send them home, too.</b>

01:56.749 --> 01:57.984
<b>Because if Milk</b>
<b>was in the top,</b>

01:58.084 --> 02:00.286
<b>she could have</b>
<b>sent home Kennedy.</b>

02:00.386 --> 02:03.556
<b>- I just didn't feel</b>
<b>nothing genuine from Milk.</b>

02:04.857 --> 02:07.126
<b>- Ben, who did you choose</b>
<b>to go home?</b>

02:07.159 --> 02:08.527
<b>- I chose Chi Chi.</b>

02:08.628 --> 02:12.131
<b>One of the things that Chi Chi</b>
<b>and I talked about was--</b>

02:12.198 --> 02:13.132
<b>- The fire.</b>

02:13.199 --> 02:15.134
<b>- It felt like it dimmed.</b>

02:15.201 --> 02:18.137
<b>- I'm not mad at, you know,</b>
<b>Ben for picking me.</b>

02:18.237 --> 02:22.808
<b>Obviously somebody up there</b>
<b>is keeping me here for a reason.</b>

02:22.909 --> 02:25.778
<b>- Chi Chi can give</b>
<b>way more than she's giving.</b>

02:25.878 --> 02:28.147
<b>Because guess what?</b>
<b>Now all eyes are on Chi Chi.</b>

02:28.214 --> 02:29.148
<b>Sorry.</b>

02:29.215 --> 02:31.617
<b>- Time to change.</b>
<b>- Whoo!</b>

02:31.717 --> 02:33.486
<b>- I was a little gagged,</b>
<b>but, um, I was a little gagged.</b>

02:33.586 --> 02:34.620
<b>- I was totally gagged.</b>

02:34.720 --> 02:35.688
<b>It's subjective.</b>

02:35.788 --> 02:36.956
<b>At some point</b>
<b>it comes down to, like,</b>

02:37.056 --> 02:40.927
<b>what does one person think</b>
<b>about a performance?</b>

02:41.027 --> 02:42.762
<b>- Or even a person.</b>

02:42.862 --> 02:45.698
<b>That monologue was about what</b>
<b>she thought of Milk as a person.</b>

02:45.798 --> 02:48.034
<b>This elimination,</b>
<b>it was so jarring,</b>

02:48.167 --> 02:51.837
<b>and it's kind of coming down</b>
<b>to personal relationships.</b>

02:51.938 --> 02:52.838
<b>Like, can we get eliminated</b>

02:52.939 --> 02:53.839
<b>because</b>
<b>we don't talk to someone?</b>

02:53.940 --> 02:55.508
<b>Is that the reality here?</b>

02:56.809 --> 02:59.078
<b>It's scary because</b>
<b>there's no comfort level.</b>

02:59.178 --> 03:02.181
<b>Everybody could go home</b>
<b>at any time for whatever reason.</b>

03:02.281 --> 03:03.749
<b>Well, I don't know</b>
<b>what's gonna happen next week,</b>

03:03.849 --> 03:05.351
<b>but it's gonna be</b>
<b>a great Christmas.</b>

03:09.455 --> 03:11.657

<b>I ain't got no time</b>

03:44.390 --> 03:45.491

03:51.163 --> 03:52.832

<b>this week's maxi challenge</b>

03:57.036 --> 04:01.073
<b>is an All Stars edition</b>
<b>of "Snatch Game!"</b>

04:01.173 --> 04:03.809
<b>[cheering]</b>

04:03.910 --> 04:06.345
<b>#AllStars3.</b>
<b>- Whoo-hoo!</b>

04:06.445 --> 04:07.780
<b>- Every season's</b>
<b>"Snatch Game"</b>

04:07.880 --> 04:11.117
<b>separates the cans</b>
<b>from the cannots,</b>

04:11.150 --> 04:13.152
<b>and this time</b>
<b>it's even gonna be harder</b>

04:13.252 --> 04:15.121

04:15.221 --> 04:17.823
<b>- Gentlemen,</b>
<b>start your engines,</b>

04:17.924 --> 04:21.460
<b>and may</b>
<b>the best All Star win.</b>

04:23.529 --> 04:24.864
<b>- Let me guess.</b>

04:24.964 --> 04:27.266
<b>- I'm going to be doing</b>
<b>Patricia Arquette</b>

04:27.366 --> 04:28.801
<b>in the television show</b>
<b>"Medium."</b>

04:28.901 --> 04:30.002
<b>- [laughs]</b>

04:30.136 --> 04:31.470
<b>- No, I'm doing RuPaul.</b>

04:31.571 --> 04:32.471
<b>- Mother Ru.</b>

04:32.572 --> 04:34.173
<b>- In my season,</b>
<b>I was so sad</b>

04:34.273 --> 04:35.942
<b>because I didn't get</b>
<b>to do "Snatch Game,"</b>

04:36.042 --> 04:39.211
<b>and I wanted to do RuPaul</b>
<b>in front of RuPaul so bad.</b>

04:39.312 --> 04:40.813
<b>And every time I do RuPaul</b>
<b>in front of people,</b>

04:40.913 --> 04:41.881
<b>they think it's hilarious.</b>

04:41.981 --> 04:43.683
<b>She likes dad jokes</b>
<b>like I do.</b>

04:43.783 --> 04:45.985
<b>She likes puns, bad jokes.</b>
<b>It's gonna be great.</b>

04:46.152 --> 04:47.019
<b>I'm winning the challenge.</b>

04:47.153 --> 04:48.287
<b>- You sound</b>
<b>real confident, sis.</b>

04:48.387 --> 04:51.257
<b>- I am.</b>
<b>- You do not play with that.</b>

04:51.357 --> 04:54.193
<b>Nobody has been successful</b>
<b>doing RuPaul.</b>

04:54.293 --> 04:55.895
<b>I mean,</b>
<b>just because you do her</b>

04:55.995 --> 04:58.664
<b>on your little show</b>
<b>playing around,</b>

04:58.764 --> 05:01.067
<b>it's harder doing it</b>
<b>before the competition.</b>

05:02.702 --> 05:03.836
<b>Who you gonna do?</b>

05:03.936 --> 05:06.105
<b>- Miss Maya Angelou.</b>

05:06.205 --> 05:07.273
<b>- What you doing?</b>

05:07.373 --> 05:09.408
<b>- I'm doing Paul Lynde.</b>
<b>- Okay.</b>

05:09.508 --> 05:10.676
<b>- Do you know him?</b>
<b>- No.</b>

05:10.776 --> 05:13.679
<b>- Paul Lynde was this comedian</b>
<b>in the seventies.</b>

05:13.779 --> 05:16.549
<b>He was the center square</b>
<b>on "Hollywood Squares"</b>

05:16.649 --> 05:18.184
<b>for like a full decade.</b>
<b>- Okay.</b>

05:19.885 --> 05:22.121
<b>- At this point,</b>
<b>Ben has won so many challenges,</b>

05:22.154 --> 05:24.757
<b>so now it's like</b>
<b>I'm this horse,</b>

05:24.857 --> 05:26.025
<b>but then I see</b>
<b>this other horse,</b>

05:26.125 --> 05:28.194
<b>like, now miles ahead</b>
<b>of the rest of us,</b>

05:28.294 --> 05:30.529
<b>and it's, like,</b>
<b>I'm never gonna catch up.</b>

05:30.630 --> 05:32.565
<b>So it's just, like,</b>
<b>I have to get a win.</b>

05:32.665 --> 05:34.166
<b>I have to get a win so bad.</b>

05:34.267 --> 05:35.501
<b>So this</b>
<b>is my first "Snatch Game."</b>

05:35.601 --> 05:37.036
<b>I have nothing to live up to,</b>
<b>so I feel like I'm--</b>

05:37.136 --> 05:38.804
<b>- What's this?</b>

05:38.905 --> 05:40.506
<b>- The thing of, like,</b>
<b>living up to a predecessor--</b>

05:40.606 --> 05:42.208
<b>- From Thorgy.</b>

05:42.308 --> 05:44.243
<b>- Oh, Thorgy wrote this?</b>
<b>- Yeah.</b>

05:44.343 --> 05:47.546
<b>- It says "[bleep]</b>
<b>this shady bitch Shangela."</b>

05:47.647 --> 05:48.814
<b>And it has</b>
<b>my name crossed out.</b>

05:48.915 --> 05:51.150
<b>- I didn't show it you</b>

05:51.250 --> 05:53.519
<b>because I thought it was</b>
<b>not helpful or appropriate.</b>

05:53.619 --> 05:55.755
<b>- But you decided</b>
<b>to hang it on the wall?</b>

05:55.855 --> 05:58.157
<b>- Oh, boy, here we go.</b>

05:58.190 --> 06:00.326
<b>- Its my note from Thorgy.</b>
<b>I put it behind the Milk note.</b>

06:00.426 --> 06:02.561
<b>- Yeah, but this one</b>
<b>specifically talks about me</b>

06:02.662 --> 06:03.930
<b>and then says,</b>
<b>"[bleep] this shady bitch,"</b>

06:04.096 --> 06:05.464
<b>and then points at my name,</b>

06:05.565 --> 06:07.333
<b>and then</b>
<b>you hung it on the wall.</b>

06:07.433 --> 06:10.736
<b>- Oh, face crack.</b>

06:10.836 --> 06:14.206
<b>I know Trixie's stomach</b>
<b>has fallen out of her ass.</b>

06:14.307 --> 06:15.675
<b>- Well, I don't care</b>
<b>what you think.</b>

06:15.775 --> 06:17.577
<b>She gave it to me because she</b>
<b>was sad, and I'm honoring her.</b>

06:18.678 --> 06:19.779
<b>I like those people.</b>

06:19.879 --> 06:21.647
<b>- Trixie, you can't tell me</b>

06:21.747 --> 06:25.618
<b>that you read Thorgy</b>
<b>calling Shangela a bitch,</b>

06:25.718 --> 06:27.219
<b>and you just saw</b>
<b>the goodness in the letter</b>

06:27.320 --> 06:28.220
<b>and wanted to put it up.</b>

06:28.321 --> 06:29.589
<b>Cut the [bleep].</b>

06:29.689 --> 06:31.691
<b>- I would not do something--</b>

06:31.791 --> 06:33.259
<b>No, girl, leave it now.</b>

06:33.359 --> 06:34.627
<b>I know you feel--</b>
<b>that's the way you really feel</b>

06:34.727 --> 06:35.695
<b>about someone like me.</b>

06:35.795 --> 06:37.597
<b>I wouldn't put that up</b>
<b>against someone</b>

06:37.697 --> 06:38.965
<b>because I would not want you</b>
<b>to feel bad like that.</b>

06:39.131 --> 06:40.533
<b>- I never even showed it to you</b>
<b>because I didn't want--</b>

06:40.633 --> 06:41.701
<b>- You hung</b>
<b>it on the wall, sis.</b>

06:41.801 --> 06:42.702
<b>- Oh, my God,</b>
<b>get out of my station.</b>

06:42.802 --> 06:43.703
<b>- But it is what it is.</b>

06:43.803 --> 06:46.439
<b>- Ooh, the drama</b>
<b>in the pageant.</b>

06:46.539 --> 06:48.341
<b>- Bitch, I've gotta light</b>
<b>an incense around here</b>

06:48.441 --> 06:49.909
<b>to clear the air.</b>

06:50.009 --> 06:50.676
<b>[RuPaul laughs, bell dings]</b>

06:52.610 --> 06:54.545
<b>[RuPaul laughs]</b>

06:57.148 --> 06:59.751
<b>- How did Thorgy's feelings</b>
<b>about Shangela</b>

06:59.851 --> 07:01.219
<b>make Shangela mad at me now?</b>

07:01.319 --> 07:02.987
<b>- I think she was just upset</b>

07:03.087 --> 07:05.523
<b>because you hung it up</b>
<b>and didn't tell her.</b>

07:05.623 --> 07:09.293
<b>- Thorgy left a really [bleep]</b>
<b>message to me on the mirror.</b>

07:09.394 --> 07:10.695
<b>I took the high road</b>
<b>on that.</b>

07:10.795 --> 07:14.198
<b>Then I find out she double</b>
<b>dogged me in a written note.</b>

07:14.298 --> 07:16.334
<b>Then Trixie hangs the note up</b>
<b>on the wall.</b>

07:16.434 --> 07:18.503
<b>How much does Shangy</b>
<b>got to take?</b>

07:18.603 --> 07:20.071
<b>- Trixie is a mess,</b>

07:20.171 --> 07:22.040
<b>and she shouldn't even</b>
<b>have that up there.</b>

07:22.140 --> 07:24.542
<b>She put it up there</b>
<b>to be a mess.</b>

07:24.642 --> 07:25.576
<b>- What do you mean</b>
<b>by a mess?</b>

07:25.677 --> 07:26.878
<b>- Why would you</b>
<b>put it up there?</b>

07:26.978 --> 07:28.146
<b>- I wouldn't, but--</b>
<b>- My point.</b>

07:28.246 --> 07:31.649
<b>So her putting it up there,</b>
<b>that's being a mess.</b>

07:31.749 --> 07:33.418
<b>- I just think maybe</b>
<b>she wasn't thinking about it.</b>

07:33.518 --> 07:34.552
<b>- Girl.</b>
<b>Come on, Ben.</b>

07:34.652 --> 07:35.586
<b>- Maybe she was just</b>
<b>thinking about her--</b>

07:35.687 --> 07:38.356
<b>- Some things</b>
<b>you just do not do.</b>

07:38.456 --> 07:41.426
<b>If we all supposed to be</b>
<b>this sisterhood and stuff,</b>

07:41.526 --> 07:43.394
<b>that type of [bleep]</b>
<b>don't supposed to fly.</b>

07:45.096 --> 07:46.831
<b>- Hey, ladies!</b>

07:46.931 --> 07:48.499
<b>- Hi!</b>

07:48.599 --> 07:49.500
<b>- Look who's here!</b>

07:49.600 --> 07:50.535
<b>- Hi, guys.</b>

07:50.635 --> 07:51.769
<b>[cheering]</b>

07:51.869 --> 07:53.271
<b>- Marc Jacobs.</b>
<b>- Yes!</b>

07:53.371 --> 07:55.006
<b>- Are you ready, Marc?</b>
<b>- I'm ready.</b>

07:55.106 --> 07:56.007
<b>- Let's go.</b>

07:56.107 --> 07:57.575
<b>- Hi, Mother.</b>

07:57.675 --> 08:01.212
<b>- BeBe, now, this is</b>
<b>an interesting get up here.</b>

08:01.312 --> 08:03.014
<b>- Right.</b>
<b>Very pointy shoulders.</b>

08:03.114 --> 08:04.549
<b>- Uh-huh.</b>
<b>Any guesses, Marc?</b>

08:04.649 --> 08:07.318
<b>- Oh, I don't know.</b>
<b>Grace Jones?</b>

08:08.953 --> 08:10.321
<b>- Oh, it is Grace Jones?</b>
<b>- It is Grace Jones.</b>

08:10.421 --> 08:12.423
<b>- Oh, my God.</b>
<b>- I guessed?</b>

08:12.523 --> 08:14.392
<b>- Yes. Wow.</b>
<b>- Yes, Grace Jones.</b>

08:14.492 --> 08:15.927
<b>- This is exciting,</b>

08:16.027 --> 08:18.129
<b>because then I just</b>
<b>get to embody somebody else</b>

08:18.229 --> 08:19.831
<b>that is not necessarily me,</b>
<b>you know?</b>

08:19.931 --> 08:22.233
<b>As much as I love her,</b>
<b>the way she would talk</b>

08:22.300 --> 08:23.801
<b>and the words that</b>
<b>come out from her mouth,</b>

08:23.901 --> 08:25.870
<b>I'm like, oh, my God,</b>
<b>did she just say that, you know?</b>

08:25.970 --> 08:27.438
<b>- But you also have</b>
<b>to be funny, which is--</b>

08:27.538 --> 08:29.240
<b>- You gotta make Ru laugh.</b>
<b>- That's right.</b>

08:29.273 --> 08:31.242
<b>- I know, and that's what</b>
<b>I'm trying to work on.</b>

08:31.309 --> 08:32.410
<b>- Yeah.</b>

08:32.510 --> 08:33.478
<b>- I personally think</b>

08:33.578 --> 08:37.348
<b>Grace Jones is a look</b>
<b>and an attitude.</b>

08:37.448 --> 08:38.483
<b>- Thanks.</b>
<b>- Nice to meet you.</b>

08:38.583 --> 08:40.718
<b>- But to make Grace Jones</b>
<b>truly funny,</b>

08:40.818 --> 08:42.453
<b>I wonder</b>
<b>if BeBe can do that.</b>

08:43.621 --> 08:44.956
<b>- Hi, Shangela.</b>

08:45.056 --> 08:46.157
<b>- Hey, Ru!</b>

08:46.257 --> 08:47.959
<b>- Hi, Shangela.</b>
<b>- Hi!</b>

08:48.059 --> 08:49.761
<b>- I see tarot cards,</b>

08:49.861 --> 08:52.830
<b>there's a telephone</b>
<b>and a kaftan back there.</b>

08:52.930 --> 08:55.199
<b>Marc, do you know who this is?</b>
<b>- Who is it?</b>

08:55.233 --> 08:57.201
<b>- This is Miss Cleo. Yes.</b>

08:57.268 --> 08:59.504
<b>- The late great Miss Cleo.</b>

08:59.604 --> 09:01.372
<b>- That's right. She died</b>
<b>a couple years ago--</b>

09:01.472 --> 09:02.940
<b>- Did she?</b>
<b>- From heart disease.</b>

09:03.041 --> 09:04.208
<b>- She didn't</b>
<b>see that coming?</b>

09:04.275 --> 09:05.243
<b>- No.</b>

09:05.343 --> 09:07.045
<b>- That was my joke, Marc.</b>

09:07.211 --> 09:08.346
<b>- I'm sorry.</b>
<b>- That was my joke.</b>

09:08.446 --> 09:10.315
<b>- Now, were there other people</b>
<b>that you considered?</b>

09:10.415 --> 09:12.950
<b>- For sure.</b>
<b>I considered diva Jenifer Lewis,</b>

09:13.051 --> 09:14.018
<b>who I love so very much.</b>

09:14.118 --> 09:16.487
<b>- And you know her intimately.</b>
<b>- Yes.</b>

09:16.587 --> 09:17.822
<b>This is actually</b>
<b>one of Jen's coats.</b>

09:17.922 --> 09:21.693
<b>She let me go diving in</b>
<b>her closet before coming here,</b>

09:21.793 --> 09:23.227
<b>and it's Marc Jacobs.</b>

09:23.261 --> 09:24.996
<b>- And you didn't know Marc</b>
<b>would be here today.</b>

09:25.096 --> 09:26.731
<b>- No! I saw it</b>
<b>in the cards, though.</b>

09:26.831 --> 09:28.066
<b>Hon, the power of the tarot.</b>

09:28.232 --> 09:29.334
<b>- Yeah, see,</b>
<b>the cards never lie.</b>

09:29.434 --> 09:30.935
<b>- Call me now, darling.</b>

09:31.035 --> 09:32.236
<b>- Well, actually,</b>
<b>your accent</b>

09:32.337 --> 09:36.374
<b>sounded a little like Ireland</b>
<b>for a minute there.</b>

09:36.474 --> 09:38.242
<b>- Wait a minute.</b>

09:38.276 --> 09:39.477
<b>Miss Cleo is Jamaican.</b>

09:39.577 --> 09:41.946
<b>If you thinking she for</b>
<b>a four-leaf clover fish,</b>

09:42.046 --> 09:45.049
<b>I'm maybe</b>
<b>going home with Cleo.</b>

09:45.149 --> 09:46.985
<b>- Oh, darling, no.</b>

09:47.085 --> 09:48.686
<b>They didn't say that</b>
<b>in the cards.</b>

09:48.786 --> 09:50.021
<b>But maybe she was Irish--</b>

09:50.121 --> 09:52.724
<b>- Are you hearing</b>
<b>an Irish accent?</b>

09:52.824 --> 09:54.959
<b>- I've got</b>
<b>a lot riding on this.</b>

09:55.059 --> 09:56.527
<b>I can't [bleep] this up.</b>
<b>Call me.</b>

09:56.627 --> 09:57.929
<b>- Call me now.</b>

09:58.029 --> 10:00.498
<b>- I'm going with the backup,</b>
<b>Jenifer Lewis.</b>

10:02.000 --> 10:03.201
<b>- Hi, Kennedy.</b>
<b>- Hi.</b>

10:03.234 --> 10:04.302
<b>- Hi, Kennedy.</b>

10:04.402 --> 10:06.337
<b>- So I see</b>
<b>a church lady outfit here.</b>

10:06.437 --> 10:09.207
<b>- Mm-hmm. She have two boys.</b>

10:09.240 --> 10:10.341
<b>- Oh, oh, okay, I know.</b>

10:10.441 --> 10:12.710
<b>You're</b>
<b>a Housewife of Atlanta.</b>

10:12.810 --> 10:13.778
<b>- Yes.</b>

10:13.878 --> 10:15.513
<b>- You're Phaedra Parks.</b>
<b>- Phaedra Parks.</b>

10:15.613 --> 10:16.748
<b>- I love that.</b>

10:16.848 --> 10:19.217
<b>- She believe in her Lord</b>
<b>and Savior Jesus Christ,</b>

10:19.317 --> 10:21.085
<b>and want to pray for you.</b>
<b>- Amen.</b>

10:21.219 --> 10:22.086
<b>- But behind closed doors,</b>

10:22.220 --> 10:23.621
<b>she want to pull out</b>
<b>her nasty stuff.</b>

10:23.721 --> 10:24.689
<b>- [laughs]</b>

10:24.789 --> 10:26.224
<b>- Now, you won</b>
<b>as Little Richard.</b>

10:26.257 --> 10:27.892
<b>- Yes, ma'am.</b>
<b>- Now, if you win this one,</b>

10:27.992 --> 10:29.360
<b>you'll be the first queen</b>
<b>in history</b>

10:29.460 --> 10:31.729
<b>to win two "Snatch Games."</b>

10:31.829 --> 10:32.764
<b>- Two Snatches.</b>

10:32.864 --> 10:35.500
<b>- Two Snatches.</b>
<b>I love that.</b>

10:35.600 --> 10:36.668
<b>- Oh, wow.</b>

10:36.768 --> 10:39.303
<b>- "Snatch Game"</b>
<b>is more important than ever</b>

10:39.404 --> 10:41.572
<b>to determine</b>
<b>who is a contender</b>

10:41.673 --> 10:43.841
<b>and who is just road kill.</b>

10:43.941 --> 10:46.110
<b>- Bring on the pressure.</b>

10:46.244 --> 10:49.047
<b>The struggle is real</b>
<b>on my end.</b>

10:52.583 --> 10:54.018
<b>- Can I talk to you?</b>

10:54.185 --> 10:56.087
<b>- Yeah, let's talk.</b>

10:56.187 --> 10:58.089
<b>- I can't go forward</b>
<b>with the "Snatch Game"</b>

10:58.189 --> 10:59.857
<b>thinking that Shangela</b>
<b>is, like, mad at me.</b>

10:59.957 --> 11:02.327
<b>- It didn't even occur to me</b>
<b>it hurt your feelings.</b>

11:02.427 --> 11:03.628
<b>- It does hurt my feelings.</b>

11:03.728 --> 11:04.629
<b>- I didn't write it.</b>

11:04.729 --> 11:07.632
<b>- All right, sis.</b>

11:07.732 --> 11:11.035
<b>I'm used to girls,</b>
<b>sometimes me,</b>

11:11.202 --> 11:12.203
<b>thinking one way about them,</b>

11:12.303 --> 11:13.504
<b>and then it totally</b>
<b>flipped the script.</b>

11:13.604 --> 11:14.906
<b>The lowest moment</b>
<b>in my season</b>

11:15.006 --> 11:17.442
<b>was when Ru</b>
<b>asked who should go home.</b>

11:17.542 --> 11:19.277
<b>- Who do you think</b>
<b>should go home tonight?</b>

11:19.377 --> 11:21.212
<b>- I would like to see</b>
<b>Shangela go.</b>

11:21.279 --> 11:22.914
<b>She's just a loud mouth,</b>

11:23.014 --> 11:24.649
<b>and she's always talking</b>
<b>and halle-looing.</b>

11:24.749 --> 11:26.217
<b>- You should be on</b>
<b>Season 5 or 6.</b>

11:26.284 --> 11:27.385
<b>That's where you should be.</b>

11:27.485 --> 11:29.387
<b>- These are people</b>
<b>I thought were my friends.</b>

11:29.487 --> 11:31.289
<b>Girl, I was cracked.</b>

11:31.389 --> 11:33.658
<b>- I have absolute respect</b>
<b>for you, and I'm really sorry.</b>

11:33.758 --> 11:35.727
<b>I should have just</b>
<b>tore that section off</b>

11:35.827 --> 11:37.061
<b>and kept it positive.</b>

11:37.228 --> 11:39.664
<b>- I appreciate your apology.</b>
<b>I do.</b>

11:39.764 --> 11:42.033
<b>Lucky you're meeting</b>
<b>"All Stars 3" me.</b>

11:42.133 --> 11:44.402
<b>Season 3 me would have</b>
<b>snatched that note off the wall</b>

11:44.502 --> 11:46.471
<b>and come for you,</b>
<b>but I'm not gonna do that.</b>

11:46.571 --> 11:48.673
<b>Trixie's apology</b>
<b>seems sincere,</b>

11:48.773 --> 11:53.077
<b>but I'm looking at her with</b>
<b>this one good eye like this.</b>

11:53.177 --> 11:54.879
<b>Oh, can I trust you, bitch?</b>

11:54.979 --> 11:57.849
<b>'Cause you giving me very</b>
<b>flip-flop fish right now.</b>

11:57.949 --> 11:59.717
<b>Let's see which way</b>
<b>the cookie crumbles.</b>

11:59.817 --> 12:00.852
<b>- All right.</b>
<b>Let's do this goddamn--</b>

12:00.952 --> 12:01.853
<b>- Good luck, RuPaul.</b>

12:01.953 --> 12:03.821
<b>- Coming up...</b>

12:03.921 --> 12:05.857
<b>- RuPaul, when are we</b>
<b>going to [bleep]?</b>

12:05.957 --> 12:07.358
<b>- [laughs]</b>
<b>- Where's Sabrina?</b>

12:07.458 --> 12:09.694
<b>I will sue the bitch,</b>

12:09.794 --> 12:11.562
<b>- Carson, I've been meaning</b>
<b>to get these back to you.</b>

15:52.449 --> 15:54.684
<b>- Sweetheart, none of these</b>
<b>queens are gonna do you.</b>

15:54.784 --> 15:56.152
<b>[all laugh]</b>

15:56.286 --> 15:58.688
<b>- I'm so happy</b>
<b>that you are here.</b>

15:58.788 --> 16:00.757
<b>- I'm so happy to be here,</b>
<b>my darling.</b>

16:02.292 --> 16:03.960
<b>- Are y'all ready to play</b>
<b>the "Snatch Game?"</b>

16:04.060 --> 16:05.662
<b>- Yes!</b>
<b>- All right.</b>

16:05.762 --> 16:07.797
<b>First question for Carson.</b>

16:07.897 --> 16:10.400
<b>Kristin Chenoweth is so tiny</b>

16:10.500 --> 16:13.303
<b>that when she walks</b>
<b>into a restaurant,</b>

16:13.370 --> 16:16.473
<b>the hostess</b>
<b>hands her a blank.</b>

16:16.573 --> 16:20.043
<b>Celebrities, go ahead</b>
<b>and write your answer down.</b>

16:20.143 --> 16:21.644
<b>All right.</b>
<b>What say you, Carson?</b>

16:21.745 --> 16:25.415
<b>- I'm not a doctor, but I'm</b>
<b>gonna say growth hormones.</b>

16:25.515 --> 16:27.384
<b>- [all laugh]</b>
<b>- All right.</b>

16:27.484 --> 16:29.919
<b>Let's go and see</b>
<b>if you have any matches.</b>

16:30.019 --> 16:32.689
<b>All right, Phaedra.</b>
<b>Ooh, oh, hey, Phaedra.</b>

16:32.789 --> 16:34.691
<b>What is that? She's fracking?</b>
<b>Is that what she's doing?</b>

16:34.791 --> 16:37.894
<b>- Girl, you know I had to take</b>
<b>that church stuff off, honey.</b>

16:37.994 --> 16:39.429
<b>- Oh, yes.</b>

16:39.529 --> 16:42.565
<b>- I said a napkin</b>
<b>to wipe up,</b>

16:42.665 --> 16:45.802
<b>'cause clearly</b>
<b>he's the appetizer.</b>

16:47.737 --> 16:49.472
<b>- Oh, okay.</b>

16:49.572 --> 16:51.674
<b>All right. Paul Lynde.</b>

16:51.775 --> 16:53.777
<b>- This is the most queens</b>
<b>I've been surrounded by</b>

16:53.877 --> 16:57.013
<b>since Charles Nelson Reilly's</b>
<b>pool party.</b>

16:57.113 --> 16:59.749
<b>[all laugh]</b>

16:59.849 --> 17:02.085
<b>- Well, I said</b>
<b>a cocktail weenie.</b>

17:03.386 --> 17:05.155
<b>'Cause it's to scale.</b>
<b>- [laughs]</b>

17:05.288 --> 17:07.023
<b>- Sorry, it's not a match,</b>
<b>Carson.</b>

17:07.123 --> 17:09.125
<b>- Not a match.</b>
<b>- Circle gets the square.</b>

17:09.292 --> 17:10.393
<b>- [laughs]</b>

17:10.493 --> 17:14.564
<b>- All right. Maya Angelou,</b>
<b>poet, activist, actress.</b>

17:14.664 --> 17:16.599
<b>- Spelling bee winner,</b>
<b>mm-hmm.</b>

17:16.700 --> 17:19.669
<b>- Maya Angelou,</b>
<b>what say you?</b>

17:19.769 --> 17:23.707
<b>- Well, I said that the hostess</b>
<b>hands the poor thing</b>

17:23.807 --> 17:25.942
<b>that same caged bird</b>

17:26.042 --> 17:29.646
<b>fried, died,</b>
<b>and laid to the side.</b>

17:29.746 --> 17:33.083
<b>- Oh. Maya, thank you</b>
<b>for answering my question</b>

17:33.249 --> 17:35.418
<b>from last round</b>
<b>in this round.</b>

17:35.518 --> 17:38.488
<b>Maybe you'll have a good answer</b>
<b>for this question</b>

17:38.588 --> 17:41.357
<b>in the next round.</b>

17:41.458 --> 17:44.394
<b>Let's move on down</b>
<b>to Jenifer Lewis.</b>

17:44.494 --> 17:45.762
<b>- Well, look at little</b>
<b>cute little Kristin.</b>

17:45.862 --> 17:47.163
<b>I love her.</b>
<b>Two Broadway divas.</b>

17:47.263 --> 17:49.132
<b>You know, I've worked with</b>
<b>Kristin way back in the day.</b>

17:49.265 --> 17:50.700
<b>- Did you?</b>
<b>- Yeah. No, I'm lying.</b>

17:50.800 --> 17:52.535
<b>I ain't worked with that bitch.</b>
<b>But anyhow, let's--</b>

17:52.635 --> 17:53.603
<b>[all laugh]</b>

17:53.703 --> 17:54.971
<b>- I think that Kristin</b>
<b>has to fit up</b>

17:55.071 --> 17:56.373
<b>in that little bubble</b>
<b>in "Wicked."</b>

17:56.473 --> 17:57.374
<b>- You saw the show.</b>
<b>- Sure.</b>

17:57.474 --> 17:58.541
<b>- I saw it,</b>
<b>and therefore,</b>

17:58.641 --> 18:00.443
<b>I think that man</b>
<b>handed her a high five</b>

18:00.543 --> 18:01.978
<b>when she walked in.</b>

18:02.078 --> 18:03.446
<b>- That would be apropos.</b>

18:03.546 --> 18:05.148
<b>- What apro-ho?</b>
<b>Who you calling a ho?</b>

18:05.281 --> 18:07.450
<b>I'm about to have</b>
<b>a hot flash up in here.</b>

18:07.550 --> 18:09.185
<b>- Ooh! Oh, yes, yes.</b>

18:09.285 --> 18:10.653
<b>- Yeah. You know,</b>
<b>I'm going through menopause.</b>

18:10.754 --> 18:11.955
<b>- Are you?</b>
<b>- Yeah.</b>

18:12.055 --> 18:13.089
<b>I don't know why</b>
<b>they call it menopause.</b>

18:13.189 --> 18:16.359
<b>There ain't no men up in it.</b>
<b>- [laughs]</b>

18:16.459 --> 18:19.696
<b>Kristin Chenoweth, what</b>
<b>did the hostess hand you?</b>

18:19.796 --> 18:21.965
<b>- A booster chair.</b>

18:22.065 --> 18:24.234
<b>- A booster chair.</b>

18:24.300 --> 18:26.069
<b>- Which I actually brought.</b>

18:26.236 --> 18:27.237
<b>- You brought one?</b>

18:27.337 --> 18:29.139
<b>- I travel</b>
<b>with my own booster.</b>

18:29.239 --> 18:32.042
<b>- Oh, wow, that's so smart.</b>

18:32.142 --> 18:34.644
<b>This question</b>
<b>is for Michelle Visage.</b>

18:34.744 --> 18:37.947
<b>I'm coming out</b>
<b>with a RuPaul cookbook.</b>

18:38.048 --> 18:44.320
<b>It includes my famous recipe</b>
<b>for spaghetti and blank balls.</b>

18:44.421 --> 18:47.524
<b>- I'm gonna go with spaghetti</b>
<b>and tucked balls.</b>

18:47.624 --> 18:48.591
<b>- Ooh,</b>
<b>those sound delicious.</b>

18:48.691 --> 18:49.893
<b>- Delicious.</b>
<b>- Oh, yes.</b>

18:49.993 --> 18:51.828
<b>- You have to kind of dig</b>
<b>to find them.</b>

18:51.928 --> 18:53.596
<b>All right,</b>
<b>let's go to the stars</b>

18:53.696 --> 18:55.265
<b>and hear</b>
<b>what they have to say.</b>

18:55.331 --> 18:56.900
<b>Grace Jones.</b>
<b>- Yes.</b>

18:57.000 --> 19:01.304
<b>- My famous recipe</b>
<b>for spaghetti and blank balls.</b>

19:01.404 --> 19:02.439
<b>What do you think it is?</b>

19:02.539 --> 19:05.108
<b>- Steel vagina.</b>

19:05.275 --> 19:06.443
<b>- Steel vagina?</b>

19:06.543 --> 19:09.045
<b>- Yes. That's the name</b>
<b>of my upcoming perfume.</b>

19:09.145 --> 19:10.413
<b>- I see.</b>

19:10.513 --> 19:12.282
<b>- This is why I don't keep</b>
<b>the company of the ladies.</b>

19:12.315 --> 19:14.784
<b>- Yes, Paul Lynde, yes.</b>

19:14.884 --> 19:17.487
<b>What are those, Grace Jones?</b>
<b>- That's the song.</b>

19:17.587 --> 19:19.456
<b>- Carson, I've meaning</b>
<b>to get these back to you.</b>

19:19.556 --> 19:20.824
<b>My apologies.</b>

19:20.924 --> 19:22.258
<b>I think she's also</b>
<b>wearing your clothes,</b>

19:22.358 --> 19:24.661
<b>but I didn't recognize them</b>
<b>without the Crisco.</b>

19:24.761 --> 19:26.963
<b>[all laugh]</b>

19:27.063 --> 19:28.531
<b>- What say you, RuPaul?</b>

19:28.631 --> 19:30.567
<b>- Well, Michelle, my balls</b>
<b>are tucked so tight</b>

19:30.667 --> 19:33.470
<b>that I blacked out, fell down,</b>
<b>woke up a second ago,</b>

19:33.570 --> 19:35.805
<b>panicked and just wrote</b>
<b>"Now available on iTunes."</b>

19:35.905 --> 19:38.708
<b>- I'm glad you reminded</b>
<b>everybody of that,</b>

19:38.808 --> 19:41.311
<b>but unfortunately,</b>
<b>that is not a match, RuPaul.</b>

19:41.411 --> 19:43.813
<b>- RuPaul, I wanted</b>
<b>to congratulate you</b>

19:43.913 --> 19:46.416
<b>on your</b>
<b>Hollywood Star of Fame.</b>

19:46.516 --> 19:48.485
<b>- Oh, thank you so much,</b>
<b>my dear.</b>

19:48.585 --> 19:53.923
<b>As we say in the industry,</b>
<b>winner winner chicken...dinner.</b>

19:56.092 --> 19:58.928
<b>- Crickets.</b>
<b>Trixie's just kind of like</b>

19:59.028 --> 20:01.564
<b>throwing these little</b>
<b>RuPaul one-liners in,</b>

20:01.664 --> 20:02.932
<b>but they're out of place.</b>

20:03.033 --> 20:04.968
<b>It's just not fitting.</b>

20:05.068 --> 20:06.736
<b>Y'all told her on the Internet</b>
<b>it was funny.</b>

20:06.836 --> 20:07.804
<b>I blame y'all.</b>

20:07.904 --> 20:11.341
<b>- Let's move on down</b>
<b>to Paul Lynde.</b>

20:11.441 --> 20:14.444
<b>My famous recipe for</b>
<b>spaghetti and blank balls.</b>

20:14.544 --> 20:18.448
<b>- Well, Ru, I just said the ones</b>
<b>that I found the most delicious.</b>

20:18.548 --> 20:19.716
<b>Anonymous.</b>

20:19.816 --> 20:21.418
<b>[all laugh]</b>

20:21.518 --> 20:24.554
<b>- Your answer</b>
<b>was anony...miss.</b>

20:25.555 --> 20:27.824
<b>- Anonymous?</b>
<b>Yes. Yes, it was.</b>

20:27.924 --> 20:29.225
<b>- Wow, darling,</b>
<b>tell another one.</b>

20:31.094 --> 20:32.228
<b>- This one's</b>
<b>for Michelle Visage.</b>

20:32.295 --> 20:34.931
<b>Ricky Martin is so hot,</b>

20:35.031 --> 20:39.035
<b>blank melts in his mouth</b>
<b>and in his hand.</b>

20:39.135 --> 20:41.337
<b>- Well, he is of</b>
<b>the Puerto Rican descent.</b>

20:41.438 --> 20:44.307
<b>- Uh-huh.</b>
<b>- I'm going to say flan.</b>

20:44.407 --> 20:46.910
<b>- Flan. Okay.</b>
<b>- Yeah.</b>

20:47.010 --> 20:48.244
<b>- Crystal LaBeija.</b>

20:48.344 --> 20:49.512
<b>Are you having a good time,</b>
<b>Crystal?</b>

20:49.612 --> 20:51.815
<b>- Darling, I'm having</b>
<b>the worst time of my life.</b>

20:51.915 --> 20:53.917
<b>I just want</b>
<b>to walk away so bad.</b>

20:54.017 --> 20:55.652
<b>Darling,</b>
<b>let me tell you something</b>

20:55.752 --> 20:57.087
<b>about my friend Monique.</b>

20:57.253 --> 20:58.021
<b>She's not here</b>
<b>because she's melting</b>

20:58.121 --> 20:59.355
<b>in his mouth</b>
<b>and his hands,</b>

20:59.456 --> 21:01.458
<b>but she called me this morning</b>
<b>and she said, Crystal,</b>

21:01.558 --> 21:03.526
<b>let me tell you about</b>
<b>the "Snatch Game."</b>

21:03.626 --> 21:05.261
<b>None of the true beauties</b>
<b>are gonna be there,</b>

21:05.328 --> 21:07.397
<b>and, darling, she was right.</b>

21:07.497 --> 21:09.265
<b>- Okay. [laughs]</b>

21:09.332 --> 21:10.767
<b>Phaedra, what do you have?</b>

21:10.867 --> 21:13.336
<b>Ricky Martin melts--</b>
<b>so damn hot.</b>

21:13.436 --> 21:15.038
<b>Do you think he's hot,</b>
<b>Phaedra?</b>

21:15.205 --> 21:17.440
<b>- Ooh.</b>

21:17.540 --> 21:18.842
<b>Ooh.</b>

21:18.942 --> 21:20.877
<b>- That's a yes?</b>

21:20.977 --> 21:22.011
<b>- Mm, mm, mm.</b>

21:22.112 --> 21:24.414
<b>I said my Candy.</b>

21:25.548 --> 21:27.951
<b>- Kennedy won "Snatch Game"</b>
<b>her season,</b>

21:28.051 --> 21:29.586
<b>but she ain't winning</b>
<b>this one.</b>

21:29.686 --> 21:32.355
<b>- You've won an uncomfortable</b>
<b>phone call to your ex</b>

21:32.455 --> 21:34.724
<b>and a half eaten hotdog</b>
<b>from the back of my car.</b>

21:36.760 --> 21:37.894
<b>- Oh, shut up, RuPaul.</b>

21:37.994 --> 21:40.230
<b>- All right. Now, Carson,</b>
<b>this one's for you.</b>

21:40.263 --> 21:43.566
<b>The U.S. Congress</b>
<b>is so dysfunctional,</b>

21:43.666 --> 21:46.536
<b>they can't pass blank.</b>

21:46.636 --> 21:49.539
<b>- They can't pass</b>
<b>the 8th grade.</b>

21:49.639 --> 21:52.542
<b>- [laughs]</b>
<b>All right, Maya Angelou.</b>

21:52.642 --> 21:53.777
<b>U.S. Congress</b>
<b>is so dysfunctional,</b>

21:53.877 --> 21:56.246
<b>they can't pass blank.</b>

21:56.346 --> 21:59.249
<b>- They can't pass gas,</b>

21:59.349 --> 22:00.383
<b>'cause we all know</b>

22:00.483 --> 22:03.119
<b>that they are</b>
<b>some uptight asses.</b>

22:03.253 --> 22:06.589
<b>- Oh, oh, some poetry</b>
<b>in that answer. Yes.</b>

22:06.689 --> 22:10.060
<b>We're gonna move on down</b>
<b>to Kristin Chenoweth.</b>

22:10.160 --> 22:11.961
<b>- They can't pass</b>
<b>gun control.</b>

22:12.062 --> 22:14.531
<b>There's only one gun</b>
<b>for all of us,</b>

22:14.631 --> 22:16.366
<b>and it's a bubble gun.</b>

22:16.466 --> 22:18.401
<b>- A bubble gun!</b>
<b>Look at these bubbles.</b>

22:18.501 --> 22:21.438
<b>Nobody can control</b>
<b>those bubbles.</b>

22:21.538 --> 22:24.507
<b>Aw, shucks.</b>
<b>Time's up.</b>

22:24.607 --> 22:28.545
<b>The winner of today's</b>
<b>"Snatch Game" is...</b>

22:28.645 --> 22:32.549
<b>the Amish, because they</b>
<b>don't have televisions.</b>

22:32.649 --> 22:33.950
<b>[all laugh]</b>

22:34.050 --> 22:37.454
<b>- Until next time,</b>
<b>I'm everybody.</b>

22:37.554 --> 22:39.022
<b>Goodbye, RuPaul.</b>

22:40.890 --> 22:43.026
<b>- Coming up...</b>
<b>- I wished it was more</b>

22:43.126 --> 22:44.761
<b>than just kind of</b>
<b>the one note that it was.</b>

22:44.861 --> 22:46.663
<b>- I didn't think</b>
<b>it was super one note.</b>

22:46.763 --> 22:48.331
<b>- It was like tumbleweed.</b>

22:48.431 --> 22:51.167
<b>[RuPaul laughs, bell dings]</b>

22:51.782 --> 22:53.651
<b>[RuPaul laughs]</b>

22:55.586 --> 22:58.923
<b>- Guess who owns everything?</b>

22:59.023 --> 23:01.292
<b>Not you. Aah! [laughs]</b>

23:01.392 --> 23:02.760
<b>- It's elimination day.</b>

23:02.860 --> 23:04.128
<b>We're recovering</b>
<b>from "Snatch Game,"</b>

23:04.228 --> 23:06.497
<b>and we had a pretty shocking</b>
<b>elimination last week,</b>

23:06.597 --> 23:07.565
<b>so I think we're all back</b>

23:07.665 --> 23:09.233
<b>into, like,</b>
<b>pins and needles mode.</b>

23:09.333 --> 23:11.068
<b>- Bitch, Trixie.</b>

23:11.168 --> 23:13.270
<b>- It wasn't the best RuPaul,</b>
<b>I'll tell you that.</b>

23:13.370 --> 23:16.473
<b>- And she know that</b>
<b>she wasn't the best.</b>

23:16.574 --> 23:18.008
<b>- How do you feel, Chi Chi?</b>

23:18.108 --> 23:19.810
<b>- Well, I mean, I played</b>

23:19.910 --> 23:21.946
<b>the dumbest Maya Angelou</b>
<b>in the world.</b>

23:22.046 --> 23:24.014
<b>- These challenges</b>
<b>are [bleep] hard.</b>

23:24.114 --> 23:25.549
<b>Also, "Snatch Game"</b>
<b>is [bleep] hard.</b>

23:25.649 --> 23:27.017
<b>- It is.</b>

23:27.117 --> 23:29.954
<b>- I really wanted to, like, do</b>
<b>really well in this challenge,</b>

23:30.054 --> 23:30.955
<b>so I'm kind of disappointed.</b>

23:31.055 --> 23:32.356
<b>I expected myself</b>
<b>to do better,</b>

23:32.456 --> 23:33.691
<b>and I think</b>
<b>the other queens here</b>

23:33.791 --> 23:35.960
<b>expected me to come in,</b>
<b>like, guns a-blazing.</b>

23:36.060 --> 23:38.696
<b>But holy [bleep],</b>
<b>did it not go good.</b>

23:40.130 --> 23:41.565
<b>- How do you feel?</b>

23:41.665 --> 23:44.235
<b>- As soon as Ru</b>
<b>laughed at my first joke,</b>

23:44.335 --> 23:45.503
<b>I was, like, all right,</b>
<b>I feel good.</b>

23:45.603 --> 23:47.505
<b>- Oh, no, Ru was in it</b>
<b>to win it with you, girl.</b>

23:47.605 --> 23:49.874
<b>- I feel really pleased</b>
<b>and, you know, I mean,</b>

23:49.974 --> 23:51.775
<b>I kind of felt</b>
<b>the other day,</b>

23:51.876 --> 23:55.613
<b>like, I wound up</b>
<b>with Trixie's win.</b>

23:57.882 --> 24:00.784

28:29.096 --> 28:30.230
<b>- Mm-hmm.</b>

28:30.330 --> 28:32.165
<b>- You know, my eyes</b>
<b>kept going to other girls,</b>

28:32.266 --> 28:34.101
<b>and they weren't</b>
<b>going to Phaedra.</b>

28:34.201 --> 28:37.804
<b>- And this runway look,</b>
<b>the green leaves on the bottom,</b>

28:37.905 --> 28:39.239
<b>the touches in the wig,</b>

28:39.339 --> 28:41.875
<b>maybe that's a little</b>
<b>arts and craftsy for me.</b>

28:41.975 --> 28:43.810
<b>Maybe up</b>
<b>the sophistication level.</b>

28:43.911 --> 28:46.847
<b>- Up next, Chi Chi DeVayne.</b>

28:46.947 --> 28:48.181
<b>- What's up, y'all?</b>

<b>- I've never seen you</b>
<b>look better.</b>

28:49.549 --> 28:50.584
<b>- Thank you.</b>

28:50.684 --> 28:53.020
<b>- You look like</b>
<b>a nice slutty teen</b>

<b>who's getting married.</b>

28:54.321 --> 28:56.623
<b>[all laugh]</b>
<b>- Teen?</b>

28:56.723 --> 28:58.992
<b>- So let's talk</b>
<b>about Maya Angelou.</b>

28:59.092 --> 29:01.995
<b>You spelled your name wrong</b>
<b>for starters,</b>

29:02.095 --> 29:04.765
<b>and then Ru asked you if you</b>
<b>knew why the caged bird sings,</b>

29:04.865 --> 29:06.500
<b>and it was like tumbleweed.</b>

29:06.600 --> 29:10.203
<b>- I would have done a little bit</b>
<b>of a later years Maya.</b>

29:10.304 --> 29:11.939
<b>I would have been</b>
<b>fuller figured,</b>

29:12.039 --> 29:13.273
<b>you know,</b>
<b>looked a little older,</b>

29:13.373 --> 29:15.108
<b>because the visual cues</b>
<b>weren't there,</b>

29:15.208 --> 29:16.109
<b>and that is crucial.</b>

29:16.209 --> 29:18.612
<b>- Up next, Trixie Mattel.</b>

29:18.712 --> 29:19.713
<b>- Hi, guys.</b>

29:19.813 --> 29:21.882
<b>- Tonight on the runway,</b>
<b>very kawaii,</b>

29:21.982 --> 29:23.517
<b>but there's a lot going on.</b>

29:23.617 --> 29:25.185
<b>- For me, more is more.</b>
<b>- Tch.</b>

29:25.285 --> 29:26.386
<b>- I mean, this is great.</b>

29:26.486 --> 29:29.723
<b>Like, I need Claritin</b>
<b>to just look at this.</b>

29:29.823 --> 29:30.891
<b>- Now let's talk about</b>
<b>your "Snatch Game."</b>

29:30.991 --> 29:32.192
<b>The first thing you did,</b>

29:32.292 --> 29:34.561
<b>when you landed with the</b>
<b>"American" CD, that was funny.</b>

29:34.661 --> 29:35.829
<b>- Yeah.</b>

29:35.929 --> 29:37.798
<b>- And then I didn't laugh,</b>
<b>like, the whole time.</b>

29:37.898 --> 29:41.001
<b>It was one note literally</b>
<b>through the whole thing.</b>

29:42.336 --> 29:43.737
<b>I know you.</b>

29:43.837 --> 29:46.340
<b>There's something that's</b>
<b>telling me you're not all here.</b>

29:46.440 --> 29:47.741
<b>- When I get nervous here,</b>

29:47.841 --> 29:49.643
<b>it's like</b>
<b>I'm at Camp Crystal Lake</b>

29:49.743 --> 29:51.278
<b>and Jason's outside</b>
<b>with a machete.</b>

29:51.445 --> 29:53.947
<b>It's like that level panic</b>
<b>sometimes.</b>

29:54.047 --> 29:57.150
<b>- Why?</b>
<b>- I don't know. It's...</b>

29:57.251 --> 29:59.720
<b>It was harder than it looks.</b>

29:59.820 --> 30:01.822
<b>[sobs] Sorry.</b>

30:01.922 --> 30:03.690
<b>I thought it was gonna be,</b>
<b>like, my challenge.</b>

30:03.790 --> 30:06.460
<b>I was, like, so excited,</b>
<b>and I got in there</b>

30:06.493 --> 30:09.930
<b>and it was just, like--</b>
<b>it's, like, frozen.</b>

30:10.030 --> 30:11.298
<b>It [bleep] sucks.</b>

30:11.465 --> 30:13.533
<b>- Don't forget</b>
<b>what you have</b>

30:13.634 --> 30:15.936
<b>and what you offer</b>
<b>and who you are,</b>

30:16.036 --> 30:19.106
<b>whether this continues</b>
<b>or not, okay?</b>

30:19.206 --> 30:20.274
<b>Fight for yourself.</b>

30:20.374 --> 30:23.577
<b>- I just want more</b>
<b>of Trixie Mattel.</b>

30:23.677 --> 30:27.314
<b>Invite her back here,</b>
<b>because we want her.</b>

30:29.383 --> 30:30.317
<b>- Thank you, ladies.</b>

30:30.484 --> 30:32.553
<b>Based on</b>
<b>the judges' critiques,</b>

30:32.653 --> 30:34.555
<b>I have made some decisions.</b>

30:37.257 --> 30:39.426
<b>- Chi Chi DeVayne.</b>

30:40.727 --> 30:42.663
<b>Kennedy Davenport.</b>

30:44.298 --> 30:45.966
<b>Trixie Mattel.</b>

30:48.769 --> 30:50.938
<b>You are in the bottom three.</b>

30:53.173 --> 30:58.445
<b>That means Aja, BeBe,</b>
<b>you're safe.</b>

30:58.545 --> 30:59.813
<b>- Thank you.</b>

30:59.913 --> 31:04.985
<b>- Shangela and DeLa,</b>
<b>each of you needs to decide</b>

31:05.085 --> 31:08.288
<b>which of the bottom three</b>
<b>you'll eliminate</b>

31:08.455 --> 31:10.591
<b>if you win the lip sync.</b>

31:10.691 --> 31:12.859
<b>Thank you, ladies.</b>

31:12.960 --> 31:15.862
<b>You may leave the stage.</b>

31:15.963 --> 31:18.465
<b>- All right, sis.</b>

31:18.532 --> 31:20.300
<b>- Careful of that bump.</b>

31:20.467 --> 31:21.468
<b>- There she goes.</b>

31:21.568 --> 31:23.470
<b>- I'm disappointed.</b>

31:23.503 --> 31:25.138
<b>I thought I was gonna win</b>
<b>this challenge,</b>

31:25.239 --> 31:27.174
<b>and instead,</b>
<b>I absolutely face planted</b>

31:27.274 --> 31:30.177
<b>in front of the person</b>
<b>I'm impersonating,</b>

31:30.277 --> 31:31.778
<b>so it's worst case scenario.</b>

31:31.878 --> 31:34.514
<b>- Each of the girls, I would</b>
<b>love to have a chat with them.</b>

31:34.615 --> 31:37.217
<b>Who wants to go with me?</b>
<b>Come on, Kens.</b>

31:37.317 --> 31:38.585
<b>- Who wants to go with me?</b>

31:38.685 --> 31:40.454
<b>- I'll go.</b>

31:40.554 --> 31:43.023
<b>- Sis, what's</b>
<b>on your mind right now?</b>

31:43.123 --> 31:44.658
<b>- It was not funny.</b>

31:44.758 --> 31:46.260
<b>- I know, baby.</b>

31:46.426 --> 31:47.728
<b>- It [bleep] sucked,</b>

31:47.828 --> 31:50.597
<b>Like, I feel like I told</b>
<b>the judges and everyone here,</b>

31:50.697 --> 31:54.334
<b>like, a secret</b>
<b>that, like, I'm so scared,</b>

31:54.434 --> 31:57.504
<b>and I didn't want</b>
<b>everybody to know</b>

31:57.604 --> 31:59.306
<b>because I don't think</b>
<b>anybody here</b>

31:59.439 --> 32:01.742
<b>saw me being afraid</b>
<b>of "Drag Race,"</b>

32:01.842 --> 32:03.477
<b>because I'm not afraid</b>
<b>of drag in the real world.</b>

32:03.577 --> 32:05.746
<b>I love "Drag Race."</b>
<b>I love being Trixie.</b>

32:05.846 --> 32:08.715
<b>And then to come here</b>
<b>and, like, to not be</b>

32:08.815 --> 32:10.717
<b>the Trixie</b>
<b>I know my fans look for,</b>

32:10.817 --> 32:12.486
<b>it's like, [bleep],</b>
<b>you know what I mean?</b>

32:15.088 --> 32:16.623
<b>- Girl,</b>
<b>there's nothing to say.</b>

32:16.723 --> 32:19.493
<b>I mean, just be fair.</b>

32:19.593 --> 32:22.329
<b>I've been here four times,</b>
<b>so just be fair.</b>

32:22.462 --> 32:23.964
<b>I'm being real about it.</b>

32:24.064 --> 32:25.699
<b>You know, I don't want it</b>
<b>to come off</b>

32:25.799 --> 32:28.468
<b>as all the girls</b>
<b>just keep saving me</b>

32:28.502 --> 32:30.304
<b>because</b>
<b>I'm their good friend.</b>

32:30.470 --> 32:31.605
<b>This is a competition.</b>

32:31.705 --> 32:33.907
<b>It's not</b>
<b>RuPaul's Best Friends Race.</b>

32:34.007 --> 32:36.343

<b>you know what I mean?</b>

<b>And what</b>
<b>I've gotten to show,</b>

32:38.245 --> 32:39.413
<b>and if I go home,</b>
<b>I'm gonna be happy.</b>

32:39.479 --> 32:40.914
<b>And if I stay,</b>
<b>I'm gonna be happy.</b>

32:41.014 --> 32:42.749
<b>So...</b>
<b>- I'm really proud of you</b>

32:42.849 --> 32:45.686
<b>for continuing</b>
<b>to plug away at this.</b>

32:45.786 --> 32:46.753
<b>- Yeah.</b>

32:46.853 --> 32:48.922
<b>- Does Chi Chi</b>
<b>deserve another chance?</b>

32:50.123 --> 32:53.093
<b>But she does have</b>
<b>such a charm,</b>

32:53.193 --> 32:55.562
<b>so I wouldn't put it past</b>
<b>anybody to save her again.</b>

32:55.662 --> 32:58.065
<b>- I'll send the next girl</b>
<b>on over.</b>

32:58.165 --> 33:00.567
<b>- First of all, I know tonight's</b>
<b>an emotional night for you.</b>

33:00.667 --> 33:01.568
<b>- Yeah.</b>

33:01.668 --> 33:02.769
<b>- Give me a hug.</b>

33:02.869 --> 33:04.504
<b>- Girl, it [bleep] sucks.</b>

33:04.605 --> 33:07.674
<b>- Like I told y'all, this is</b>
<b>the Game of Thrones of drag.</b>

33:07.774 --> 33:11.345
<b>The seven kingdoms, baby,</b>
<b>you've gotta have alliances.</b>

33:11.445 --> 33:13.347
<b>So I'm trying to figure out</b>

33:13.447 --> 33:16.750
<b>is Trixie Jon Snow</b>
<b>or is she Cersei Lannister?</b>

33:16.850 --> 33:20.254
<b>Because I ain't trying to be up</b>
<b>in a red wedding situation.</b>

33:21.722 --> 33:23.457
<b>I know how talented you are,</b>

33:23.490 --> 33:25.525
<b>but you also know</b>
<b>this is a competition,</b>

33:25.626 --> 33:28.161
<b>and all of us want to win,</b>

33:28.262 --> 33:33.233
<b>and I have to put my allegiance</b>
<b>where I feel I have allies.</b>

33:33.333 --> 33:35.035
<b>- I feel like</b>
<b>it's behind us,</b>

33:35.135 --> 33:38.405
<b>and I don't think it would</b>
<b>come up in a lipstick situation,</b>

33:38.472 --> 33:40.073
<b>but I hope that</b>
<b>what happened yesterday</b>

33:40.173 --> 33:42.576
<b>isn't, like, the reason</b>
<b>you would pick my lipstick.</b>

33:42.676 --> 33:44.878
<b>- No, but even</b>
<b>the whole note thing,</b>

33:44.978 --> 33:47.214
<b>all that kind of stuff</b>
<b>just sits with me</b>

33:47.314 --> 33:48.582
<b>in the fact</b>
<b>when I'm thinking, like,</b>

33:48.682 --> 33:49.883
<b>if I'm in the bottom,</b>

33:49.983 --> 33:52.252
<b>is she gonna</b>
<b>ever save me or not?</b>

33:52.419 --> 33:55.022
<b>Of everybody</b>
<b>in the bottom three,</b>

33:55.122 --> 33:57.057
<b>you're the one</b>
<b>I worry about.</b>

33:57.157 --> 33:59.259
<b>This game</b>
<b>is a game based on trust.</b>

33:59.426 --> 34:01.628
<b>Kennedy is my sister,</b>

34:01.728 --> 34:04.064
<b>and, yes, Chi Chi's been</b>
<b>in the bottom four times,</b>

34:04.164 --> 34:06.166
<b>but at least I know</b>
<b>I can trust Chi Chi.</b>

34:06.266 --> 34:08.502
<b>Can I trust Trixie Mattel?</b>

34:08.602 --> 34:10.137
<b>Are you my ally, girl?</b>

34:12.506 --> 34:14.875
<b>- Hi.</b>
<b>- Here we go, girl.</b>

34:14.975 --> 34:16.209
<b>There has to be</b>
<b>somebody at the top,</b>

34:16.310 --> 34:17.678
<b>there gotta be somebody</b>
<b>at the bottom,</b>

34:17.778 --> 34:19.046
<b>there's gotta be</b>
<b>some people in the middle.</b>

34:19.146 --> 34:21.582
<b>And I just feel like</b>
<b>I fell in the middle.</b>

34:21.682 --> 34:23.584
<b>I don't feel like</b>
<b>I did a bad job.</b>

34:23.684 --> 34:26.453
<b>I'm the one that was</b>
<b>the strongest out of the three,</b>

34:26.486 --> 34:27.487
<b>and I'm just being honest.</b>

34:27.588 --> 34:29.089
<b>I do feel that way,</b>

34:29.189 --> 34:31.925
<b>but at the end of the day,</b>
<b>it's your decision.</b>

34:32.025 --> 34:34.261
<b>- This decision</b>
<b>feels impossible.</b>

34:34.361 --> 34:36.496
<b>Chi Chi's wound up in the bottom</b>
<b>a few times now,</b>

34:36.597 --> 34:40.867
<b>but she has</b>
<b>this can-do attitude,</b>

34:40.968 --> 34:42.836
<b>which speaks very well</b>
<b>for her continuing.</b>

34:42.936 --> 34:45.038
<b>Kennedy has been</b>
<b>a consistently hard worker,</b>

34:45.138 --> 34:48.041
<b>and she has brought her all</b>
<b>to everything.</b>

34:48.141 --> 34:50.978
<b>But Trixie's</b>
<b>just been landing</b>

34:51.078 --> 34:52.980
<b>in the middle of this</b>
<b>competition over and over.</b>

34:53.080 --> 34:54.948
<b>I know that she has</b>
<b>more to bring.</b>

34:55.048 --> 34:57.050
<b>I want to see it so badly,</b>

34:57.150 --> 34:59.920
<b>but I don't know</b>
<b>if we're gonna get it.</b>

35:04.791 --> 35:09.129
<b>It's never easy to have</b>
<b>to choose a girl to go home.</b>

35:09.229 --> 35:11.965
<b>It is not comfortable</b>
<b>to feel like</b>

35:12.065 --> 35:16.904
<b>I am in charge of so many</b>
<b>people's fates week after week.</b>

35:17.004 --> 35:20.140
<b>- I know this is gonna</b>
<b>crush someone's dreams,</b>

35:20.240 --> 35:23.243
<b>but at the end of the day,</b>
<b>this is the competition,</b>

35:23.343 --> 35:26.647
<b>and I've got to make</b>
<b>some very hard choices.</b>

35:28.248 --> 35:28.916
<b>[RuPaul laughs, bell dings]</b>

35:30.916 --> 35:32.818
<b>[RuPaul laughs]</b>

35:35.821 --> 35:36.822
<b>- Welcome back, ladies.</b>

35:36.922 --> 35:40.392
<b>Two top All Stars</b>
<b>stand before me.</b>

35:40.492 --> 35:45.230
<b>Ladies, this is your chance</b>
<b>to win $10,000,</b>

35:45.331 --> 35:46.865
<b>and earn the power</b>

35:46.966 --> 35:50.836
<b>to give one of</b>
<b>the bottom queens the chop.</b>

35:52.237 --> 35:54.139
<b>The time has come...</b>
<b>[thunder]</b>

35:54.239 --> 35:56.241
<b>to lip sync...</b>

35:56.342 --> 35:59.378
<b>[echoing] for your legacy.</b>

35:59.478 --> 36:01.113
<b>- If I don't beat Shangela,</b>

36:01.213 --> 36:04.583
<b>then I'll be one out of four</b>
<b>that I won.</b>

36:04.683 --> 36:06.652
<b>I have to win this.</b>

36:06.752 --> 36:11.123
<b>- Good luck</b>
<b>and don't [bleep] it up.</b>

<b>I've made my decision.</b>

38:08.974 --> 38:10.209
<b>Shangela.</b>

38:11.677 --> 38:12.878
<b>You're a winner, baby.</b>

38:12.978 --> 38:14.546
<b>- Yay! Thank you.</b>

38:20.853 --> 38:23.455
<b>- BenDeLaCreme.</b>

38:23.555 --> 38:25.791
<b>You are also</b>
<b>a winner, baby.</b>

38:25.891 --> 38:29.828
<b>- Oh!</b>
<b>- Oh!</b>

38:29.928 --> 38:34.400
<b>- You've both won</b>
<b>a cash prize of $5,000.</b>

38:34.500 --> 38:35.834
<b>- All right.</b>

38:35.934 --> 38:38.370
<b>- And you've each</b>
<b>won the power</b>

38:38.504 --> 38:42.875
<b>to send one</b>
<b>of the bottom queens home.</b>

38:42.975 --> 38:43.876
<b>- Wow.</b>

38:43.976 --> 38:46.812
<b>- Oh, my God.</b>

38:46.912 --> 38:47.980
<b>What?</b>

38:48.080 --> 38:50.883
<b>- There's three of us</b>
<b>up for elimination,</b>

38:50.983 --> 38:52.418
<b>and there's two lipsticks.</b>

38:52.518 --> 38:54.253
<b>It's bad.</b>

38:55.688 --> 38:57.556
<b>- BenDeLaCreme, which queen</b>

38:57.656 --> 39:00.626
<b>have you chosen</b>
<b>to get the chop?</b>

39:00.726 --> 39:04.296
<b>- Well, the queens on stage</b>

39:04.396 --> 39:05.965
<b>have very different</b>
<b>track records,</b>

39:06.065 --> 39:08.233
<b>but Chi Chi is someone</b>

39:08.334 --> 39:11.236
<b>who has landed in the bottom</b>
<b>several times,</b>

39:11.337 --> 39:13.706
<b>but also somebody</b>
<b>who is gonna leave this place</b>

39:13.806 --> 39:16.308
<b>ready to set</b>
<b>the world on fire.</b>

39:17.376 --> 39:19.912
<b>I chose Chi Chi.</b>

39:20.012 --> 39:21.547
<b>- Shangela, it's your turn.</b>

39:23.082 --> 39:24.149
<b>- It's a difficult decision.</b>

39:24.249 --> 39:25.551
<b>The person that I've chosen,</b>

39:25.584 --> 39:26.819
<b>I don't want them</b>
<b>to feel like</b>

39:26.919 --> 39:29.021
<b>it's anything personal</b>
<b>in any way.</b>

39:29.121 --> 39:32.858
<b>This person left "RuPaul's Drag</b>
<b>Race" not winning the crown,</b>

39:32.958 --> 39:34.893
<b>but definitely</b>
<b>going forward as a winner</b>

39:34.994 --> 39:36.528
<b>and creating a career</b>
<b>for themselves,</b>

39:36.629 --> 39:39.798
<b>and I know they will do that</b>
<b>long after this</b>

39:39.898 --> 39:41.967
<b>because I believe</b>
<b>in their talent.</b>

39:42.067 --> 39:43.836
<b>But...</b>

39:46.505 --> 39:47.806
<b>I also Chi Chi.</b>

39:53.679 --> 39:58.083
<b>- Chi Chi, you are</b>
<b>and will always be an All Star.</b>

39:58.183 --> 40:01.553
<b>Now sashay away.</b>

40:01.654 --> 40:03.722
<b>[applause]</b>
<b>- Thank you.</b>

40:07.126 --> 40:09.361
<b>Thank you guys so much.</b>

40:09.528 --> 40:11.397
<b>- We love you, Chi Chi.</b>
<b>- Bye.</b>

40:11.530 --> 40:14.433
<b>- Uh!</b>

40:14.533 --> 40:16.235
<b>[sighs]</b>

40:16.335 --> 40:20.272
<b>I'm sad to go, but I think</b>
<b>I did the best that I could.</b>

40:20.372 --> 40:21.974
<b>All Stars 3 was so hard.</b>

40:22.074 --> 40:23.375
<b>[laughs]</b>

40:23.542 --> 40:25.844
<b>Thank you.</b>
<b>[bell rings]</b>

40:28.547 --> 40:30.249
<b>- Blessed be, kitty girl.</b>

40:30.349 --> 40:34.954
<b>Whatever you do,</b>
<b>don't look behind you.</b>

40:35.054 --> 40:36.889
<b>[floorboards creak]</b>

40:36.989 --> 40:38.557
<b>- Aah!</b>

40:38.657 --> 40:41.493
<b>- [sighs] Why don't</b>
<b>they ever listen?</b>

40:47.392 --> 40:48.626
<b>- Next time</b>
<b>on "All Stars..."</b>

40:48.726 --> 40:53.197
<b>- We're throwing ourselves</b>
<b>a little Andy Warhol ball.</b>

40:53.297 --> 40:54.465
<b>- Yeah!</b>
<b>- Yeah!</b>

40:54.565 --> 40:56.334
<b>- Yay, we get to make stuff.</b>

40:56.434 --> 40:57.969
<b>Bam!</b>

40:58.069 --> 40:59.470
<b>- Oh!</b>

40:59.570 --> 41:01.139
<b>- Poor baby.</b>

41:01.239 --> 41:02.740
<b>- All I can say is R.I.P.</b>
<b>to this challenge,</b>

41:02.840 --> 41:04.175
<b>'cause you murdered it.</b>

41:04.275 --> 41:06.110
<b>- You would be definitely be</b>
<b>catching everybody's attention</b>

41:06.210 --> 41:07.311
<b>at Studio 54.</b>

41:07.412 --> 41:09.213
<b>- You can do better</b>
<b>and more.</b>

41:10.681 --> 41:12.984
<b>- This may be the worst thing</b>
<b>I've seen on "Drag Race."</b>

41:13.084 --> 41:16.454
<b>- Someone's feelings</b>
<b>are going to be hurt.</b>

41:17.588 --> 41:18.623
<b>- It's "All Stars," girl.</b>

41:18.723 --> 41:19.824
<b>Anything can happen.</b>
