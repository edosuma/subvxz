17:55.674 --> 17:58.438
Who got Junior?
Some niggas carjacked me.

17:58.510 --> 18:01.070
They took the fucking car when
Junior was in the back seat.

18:01.146 --> 18:03.671

don't really suit you.

19:01.406 --> 19:02.839
It was my grandmother's house.

19:03.475 --> 19:05.102
Who you living with?

19:05.177 --> 19:06.974
P- Money and four other girls.

19:07.546 --> 19:10.606
We do all the fucking hustling,
and he makes all the money.

19:10.682 --> 19:13.048
I'm just trying to make enough
money so I can get out of it.

19:15.687 --> 19:16.949
What's your son's name?

19:22.161 --> 19:23.526
Otis Junior.

19:23.595 --> 19:25.495
So you're Otis Senior?

19:26.999 --> 19:28.432
Yeah, they call me O2.

19:29.801 --> 19:30.893
"O2?"

19:31.270 --> 19:34.137
Back in the day when I
was on the block,

19:34.206 --> 19:37.437
I used to go to these different
neighborhoods and set it off.

19:37.509 --> 19:41.411
Then I would disappear.
Just vanish.

19:42.214 --> 19:44.375
So they started
calling me "Oxygen. "

19:44.449 --> 19:48.442
It got so crazy, they just doubled
it up, started calling me O2.

19:48.520 --> 19:50.454
So you were in the life?

19:50.522 --> 19:52.422
Before I got locked up.

19:53.992 --> 19:56.222
So you couldn't vanish
when it counted most, huh?

19:57.496 --> 19:59.361
How long?

19:59.431 --> 20:00.659
I did six years.

20:01.733 --> 20:04.065
Only been out
on parole for a month.

20:04.136 --> 20:07.594
So, I suppose shooting up people
and having a gun and all that shit

20:07.673 --> 20:09.971
is probably a violation
of your parole, huh?

20:10.042 --> 20:11.907
I got the gun from work.

20:11.977 --> 20:13.467
You got the gun from work?

20:13.545 --> 20:15.979
It's a part of
a program for ex-cons.

20:16.048 --> 20:17.640
I'd have never took
the gun if the dude

20:17.716 --> 20:20.184

replace me would have showed up.

20:20.252 --> 20:21.344
So you stole it?

20:21.420 --> 20:22.717
I was going to
take the gun back.

20:22.788 --> 20:24.221
That sounds like bullshit

20:26.725 --> 20:27.749
