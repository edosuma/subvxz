00:26.333 --> 00:28.750
MADRID
FIVE DAYS SINCE D-DAY

00:31.541 --> 00:32.916
Oh, Alicia…

00:33.708 --> 00:36.541
Now the only way out
is by taking the blame.

00:37.375 --> 00:39.291
And who's gonna do that?

00:39.375 --> 00:40.875
For the CNI, Prieto.

00:41.375 --> 00:43.083
For the police, you.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.416
Package delivered, Professor.
I'm out in two minutes.

00:52.666 --> 00:55.666
Shit's gonna hit the fan
in every possible scenario.

00:55.750 --> 00:56.708
Be strong.

00:57.208 --> 00:58.875
We're with you on this.

00:59.458 --> 01:00.416
Lisbon!

01:00.500 --> 01:02.041
Welcome to the Bank of Spain.

01:02.625 --> 01:04.458
The government gave the orders.

01:04.541 --> 01:07.291
The National Intelligence Agency,
chief of police,

01:07.375 --> 01:08.916
and Ministry of the Interior.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.583
All of them,
absolutely all of them knew about it.

01:15.125 --> 01:17.416
Where the fuck is the helicopter going?

01:18.333 --> 01:20.458
The official
magistrate of Madrid

01:20.541 --> 01:22.791
has initiated proceedings
against Alicia Sierra…

01:27.000 --> 01:29.333
and put out an order for her arrest.

01:29.416 --> 01:31.791
-Yes!
-Come on!

01:32.625 --> 01:35.250
Professor.
Lisbon, we've got Lisbon!

01:38.208 --> 01:40.833
Listen to me. This war,

01:41.416 --> 01:42.416
we're going to win it.

01:43.625 --> 01:44.625
For Nairobi.

01:45.208 --> 01:46.166
For Nairobi.

01:46.250 --> 01:47.541
For Nairobi.

01:48.041 --> 01:49.041
For Nairobi.

01:49.125 --> 01:50.666
For Nairobi!

01:51.250 --> 01:52.666
For Nairobi!

01:52.750 --> 01:53.958
For Nairobi!

01:54.833 --> 01:56.583
For Nairobi!

01:57.208 --> 01:59.083
For Nairobi!

01:59.166 --> 02:00.916
For Nairobi!

02:26.375 --> 02:28.000
Checkmate, you son of a bitch.

02:36.708 --> 02:40.291
If you move an inch, I'll shoot you.
And trust me, I'd love to see you dead.

02:43.833 --> 02:45.625
I'm the wife of a dead man.

02:47.291 --> 02:49.208
I'm a disgraced police officer.

02:50.583 --> 02:53.791
People who used to love me
think I'm a torturer. All thanks to you.

02:53.875 --> 02:57.000
And the only reason
I'm not emptying my clip into your brain

02:57.083 --> 02:59.833
is because someone's gonna need me
for the next 18 years.

03:01.375 --> 03:03.041
But it's a really fine line.

03:05.500 --> 03:07.500
And if you make me cross it, I'll do it

03:07.583 --> 03:09.000
with a smile on my face.

03:10.875 --> 03:12.041
This is where you've been.

03:12.833 --> 03:14.083
This is your hideout.

03:16.500 --> 03:19.333
In the most vile pit in all of Madrid,
of course.

03:19.916 --> 03:23.125
This place fits who you are. You're a rat.

03:23.208 --> 03:24.958
What are you going to do to me?

03:26.958 --> 03:29.750
You're gonna tell me
the whole plan

03:30.250 --> 03:31.625
so I can deliver you on a platter.

03:32.541 --> 03:35.750
I'm gonna make sure
that you're charged with terrorism,

03:36.458 --> 03:38.250
sentenced to life in prison,

03:38.750 --> 03:41.833
so you don't ever see sunlight
for the rest of your life.

03:42.875 --> 03:44.208
Because listen to me.

03:44.958 --> 03:46.083
Your sentence

03:46.750 --> 03:48.291
will be our salvation.

05:20.458 --> 05:22.541
-Look at the civility.
-Sure.

05:22.625 --> 05:24.416
The beautiful people.

05:24.500 --> 05:28.458
And here we are together, father and son.
So poetic.

05:28.541 --> 05:32.208
Well, it's not like
our relationship has been ideal, Dad.

05:32.291 --> 05:35.625
-Yes, but I forgive you.
-You forgave me, for what?

05:35.708 --> 05:36.916
For being born.

05:37.708 --> 05:40.458
Your mother and I
had an incredible relationship.

05:40.541 --> 05:41.791
Exceptional woman.

05:43.333 --> 05:45.583
And you stood in the way of our happiness.

05:47.375 --> 05:49.833
I wanted to take her to dinners,
go traveling,

05:50.583 --> 05:53.541
make love to her
in the most beautiful places in the world.

05:53.625 --> 05:57.750
And then you showed up and ruined it all.
You were like a nuclear warhead.

05:58.250 --> 06:00.666
You completely destroyed our dreams.

06:00.750 --> 06:02.791
-I don't know. Lots of people have kids.
-Hmm.

06:02.875 --> 06:05.541
-You could've adapted.
-Look at those lobsters!

06:07.708 --> 06:10.666
Oh, we should go eat here. Maître!

06:10.750 --> 06:13.666
Two Danish aquavits
and the menu, please.

06:16.208 --> 06:17.166
Rafael.

06:18.083 --> 06:19.000
Rafael,

06:19.500 --> 06:23.541
we're here so we can have
a fresh start, hmm?

06:24.666 --> 06:27.541
We're not here
to dwell on the past or our resentments.

06:33.333 --> 06:34.458
You're right, Dad.

06:35.041 --> 06:38.250
The past is the past,
and it doesn't really make sense to…

06:39.416 --> 06:41.541
keep bringing it up, so, that's it.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.416
I'm really glad that we're here,
the two of us together again.

06:49.500 --> 06:50.375
Really.

06:51.250 --> 06:53.375
Oh, Tatiana.

07:13.041 --> 07:14.958
I'm here for a fresh start
with your girlfriend?

07:15.041 --> 07:17.375
A little family honeymoon,
just the three of us.

07:28.333 --> 07:30.041
I guess I'll go to the bathroom.

07:34.375 --> 07:35.416
Something wrong?

07:35.500 --> 07:38.708
He's just a little fussy.
He didn't know you were coming.

07:39.833 --> 07:42.166
Well, did you tell him
he's here for a heist?

07:42.250 --> 07:45.625
My love,
the things that actually matter in life

07:45.708 --> 07:47.500
always come unexpectedly.

07:54.625 --> 07:56.500
And after that, what?

07:58.333 --> 08:00.166
-After the Plan Paris?
-Mm-hmm.

08:01.833 --> 08:03.833
Then we immediately begin Plan Rome.

08:05.333 --> 08:06.166
No.

08:06.916 --> 08:08.958
-Rome? Seriously?
-Mm-hmm. Yeah.

08:09.458 --> 08:12.041
-That's wonderful!
-What?

08:13.250 --> 08:16.833
Hey, what's happened to you?
You used to be stone cold.

08:16.916 --> 08:19.125
You're not turning into a romantic,
are you?

08:19.208 --> 08:21.375
Of course not.

08:21.458 --> 08:24.375
And what happens after we go to Rome?
Plan Venice?

08:25.541 --> 08:29.208
I meant it as a reference of the burning
of Rome during the reign of Nero.

08:29.875 --> 08:30.791
Nero?

08:31.750 --> 08:33.958
That doesn't sound very sexy. Go ahead.

08:34.666 --> 08:37.458
If we release
the only person they were able to capture

08:38.000 --> 08:40.833
and get them in the bank
right under everyone's noses,

08:42.416 --> 08:43.625
it'll be so humiliating

08:43.708 --> 08:46.291
that they'll try and destroy us
as soon as possible.

08:47.250 --> 08:49.416
They'll resort to using maximum force.

08:50.708 --> 08:51.666
Military.

08:52.375 --> 08:54.083
Let's prepare to intervene immediately.

08:54.166 --> 08:56.416
-I need to talk to you.
-Leave brainstorming for later.

08:56.500 --> 08:57.375
I need backup.

08:57.458 --> 09:00.208
I need intervention officers
from Catalonia and the Basque Country.

09:00.291 --> 09:01.833
-I want Urruticoetxea!
-Great idea.

09:01.916 --> 09:04.041
Get them and take them
to Puerta del Sol square.

09:04.125 --> 09:06.625
I hear someone's dressed up
and picking pockets!

09:06.708 --> 09:08.041
Only the army can fix this.

09:08.125 --> 09:11.083
Wait a minute, this is a civil matter.
This is an issue for the police.

09:11.166 --> 09:14.625
It's a matter of our national security.
I'm bringing the military in.

09:14.708 --> 09:17.083
They'll come out victorious
or come out dead.

09:17.791 --> 09:20.083
Martínez, get me Major Sagasta.

09:20.166 --> 09:23.541
One battalion, maybe two. I don't know.

09:23.625 --> 09:25.833
And moreover,
they'll go in thirsty for blood

09:25.916 --> 09:28.500
and the killing of hostages
won't matter that much anymore.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.541
And so then what?

09:31.958 --> 09:34.958
-How's it going downstairs?
-Fifty-nine tons are already melted.

09:35.041 --> 09:37.666
Connect the pump, Palermo.
Let's begin extraction.

09:37.750 --> 09:40.458
But there's 31 tons left.
The plan's to melt it all.

09:40.541 --> 09:43.541
I'm here, so the plan's changed.
The priority now is to get it out.

09:43.625 --> 09:45.625
Our only chance will be
to extract the gold

09:45.708 --> 09:47.875
we've managed to melt
up until that moment.

09:48.375 --> 09:49.208
Oh.

09:49.291 --> 09:51.916
I can't believe
you got me excited about Rome.

09:52.833 --> 09:55.458
-And how long do we have?
-Three or four hours.

09:55.541 --> 09:58.875
They're close to figuring out our plan.
The helicopter's still in the air.

10:04.666 --> 10:06.125
Where is that helicopter?

10:06.208 --> 10:09.458
It's heading southwest from Guadalajara.
We're 11 minutes behind.

10:09.541 --> 10:12.708
I can send an F18 from the base
in Torrejón and shoot it down.

10:12.791 --> 10:14.875
No. That pilot's useless
to us if he's dead.

10:14.958 --> 10:17.708
That helicopter's gonna land.
The moment it does, we'll be there.

10:17.791 --> 10:18.625
Of course.

10:19.291 --> 10:23.333
Bear 21.
Bear 21, this is Bravo 03.

10:23.416 --> 10:25.958
Land at once. I repeat, land at once.

10:30.166 --> 10:33.916
Don't even think about touching me!
The wound is next to the femoral artery.

10:34.750 --> 10:36.916
Stitch him up.
Make sure he shuts up.

10:37.000 --> 10:37.875
Okay, hero.

10:37.958 --> 10:40.833
I'll only be worked on
by a surgeon in a hospital!

10:42.583 --> 10:46.291
What the fuck did you do, Manila?
You came in here under one condition:

10:46.375 --> 10:49.750
You wouldn't reveal your identity.
Just a hostage with hostages.

10:49.833 --> 10:51.833
Did you see the guy holding an M16?

10:51.916 --> 10:55.875
Arturo had the M16 and he's useless.
Arturo with a bazooka is useless!

10:55.958 --> 10:57.666
There was a protocol.

10:57.750 --> 10:59.666
You know I kind of saved your life.

10:59.750 --> 11:01.833
Maybe you could at least thank me for it.

11:03.083 --> 11:05.333
If they caught us,
you'd stay with Cincinnati.

11:06.875 --> 11:08.083
That was the deal.

11:08.166 --> 11:09.750
You were given your orders,

11:09.833 --> 11:11.250
and you blew it.

11:11.750 --> 11:14.375
And now my son has no plan B.

11:14.458 --> 11:16.333
-Manila did what she had to do.
-No.

11:16.416 --> 11:18.625
We trusted her
with the mission of raising our child,

11:18.708 --> 11:20.208
and she wiped her ass with it.

11:20.291 --> 11:21.458
It's never Arturo's fault.

11:22.208 --> 11:24.916
No matter what he does.
I mean, even if he has an M16,

11:25.000 --> 11:27.458
or rubs himself against you
with a hard-on,

11:27.541 --> 11:29.625
or abuses hostages…
It's always somebody else's fault!

11:31.541 --> 11:32.375
Look,

11:33.916 --> 11:35.333
if we lose Cincinnati,

11:36.250 --> 11:37.375
we're the only ones to blame.

11:38.583 --> 11:41.666
We came in here because we wanted to,
so cut the shit out.

11:42.250 --> 11:43.750
And get back to work.

11:55.833 --> 11:57.250
Attention, gentlemen!

11:57.333 --> 12:00.625
There's a change of plans.
I repeat, a change of plans.

12:00.708 --> 12:03.875
Get all the ingots that are left
and plug in the extractor pump.

12:03.958 --> 12:05.125
Let's go, right now!

12:05.958 --> 12:08.791
Come on!
Move it, move it. Quit sitting around.

12:09.291 --> 12:11.500
Eight more hours at full blast
and we can melt it all.

12:11.583 --> 12:14.416
The melting is secondary.
Now it's about extraction.

12:14.500 --> 12:17.166
They said we had to melt 90 tons
so we could get out alive

12:17.250 --> 12:18.375
but now 60's enough?

12:18.458 --> 12:20.000
Lisbon's in the bank now.

12:20.083 --> 12:23.291
That will force them
into an intervention we can't handle.

12:23.375 --> 12:27.208
Either we take the gold out now
or we're done, brother. Understand?

12:28.083 --> 12:29.791
Did you have that information before?

12:29.875 --> 12:31.750
That Lisbon's rescue
would jeopardize our plan?

12:31.833 --> 12:35.041
-Come on, I didn't know fucking shit!
-Of course not, damn it!

12:36.250 --> 12:38.750
Because we never agreed to that.

12:38.833 --> 12:41.208
If getting someone out of jail
puts the plan at risk,

12:41.291 --> 12:43.125
then they stay in jail, period.

12:43.208 --> 12:44.708
And that goes for everyone.

12:45.500 --> 12:47.166
I'm not the one giving orders.

12:47.791 --> 12:49.166
You were before, damn it.

12:49.833 --> 12:51.583
Now what? You run the errands?

12:52.750 --> 12:53.916
Palermo,

12:54.500 --> 12:56.583
looks like we're starting to improvise,

12:56.666 --> 12:58.916
and that's how people
get killed in a heist.

13:08.458 --> 13:10.000
Lisbon to Professor. Do you copy?

13:13.916 --> 13:15.125
Lisbon to Professor.

13:15.208 --> 13:16.041
Do you copy?

13:23.875 --> 13:25.708
Lisbon to Professor. Do you copy?

13:30.958 --> 13:33.833
How long did they keep you
under interrogation in the tent?

13:35.625 --> 13:36.583
Thirty hours.

13:37.291 --> 13:40.041
Why? Is that too long
to keep your mouth shut?

13:40.125 --> 13:41.208
No, for me, no.

13:42.250 --> 13:43.583
For you, I don't know.

13:44.083 --> 13:46.458
Maybe you saw a badge
and you felt nostalgic.

13:47.875 --> 13:51.208
And after that, you told them
how we're getting out the gold.

13:52.250 --> 13:55.583
At least I didn't shake my ass
at every man with a pulse in Panama.

13:58.041 --> 14:00.375
Professor, this is Lisbon.
I need the response.

14:01.041 --> 14:02.500
What is Raquel doing in there?

14:04.583 --> 14:07.083
He's probably working
with Marseille outside.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.750
In 20 minutes
we should get a check-up call.

14:10.833 --> 14:13.625
But if we have 20 minutes,
I need to take a shower.

14:14.791 --> 14:16.166
And get me a jumpsuit.

14:18.250 --> 14:21.000
I obey your orders, Mrs. Professor.

14:31.208 --> 14:33.041
How did Raquel get into the bank?

14:36.875 --> 14:38.250
How are your buddies coming out?

14:45.416 --> 14:47.000
How are you getting the gold?

14:51.791 --> 14:53.750
Okay, either you talk…

14:53.833 --> 14:55.166
…or I'll shoot you.

14:59.166 --> 15:02.000
It's not the first time
someone's threatened to shoot me.

15:02.083 --> 15:04.083
Oh, okay. No threats then.

15:13.375 --> 15:15.375
Jesus, the self-control.

15:24.666 --> 15:25.875
We better talk now,

15:26.833 --> 15:29.375
before I decide to shoot you again. Okay?

15:30.458 --> 15:31.875
You're melting the gold.

15:33.375 --> 15:34.291
What for?

15:40.083 --> 15:42.166
We're going to turn the gold into ingots,

15:43.458 --> 15:44.458
into pellets.

15:45.625 --> 15:47.875
Two millimeters
so we can safely get it out.

15:49.625 --> 15:50.458
I knew it.

15:53.458 --> 15:54.666
How's it coming out?

15:55.750 --> 15:57.291
Through the only way possible.

15:58.958 --> 16:00.416
Through the bank sewage system.

16:01.333 --> 16:03.666
It'll come out broken up,
mixed with the water.

16:11.333 --> 16:13.166
You think I'm a total idiot, don't ya?

16:15.208 --> 16:18.291
The sewers in the underground
are filled with police officers.

16:19.166 --> 16:20.208
Tell me the truth.

16:21.208 --> 16:24.708
It'll pass in front of them,
covered in mud, and they won't see it.

16:26.458 --> 16:27.458
So then,

16:28.708 --> 16:31.166
if you're gonna get it out
through the sewers…

16:34.041 --> 16:34.916
why are you here?

16:36.041 --> 16:37.541
What are you doing here?

16:38.500 --> 16:39.333
Come on!

16:40.125 --> 16:43.791
Sagasta, Tamayo speaking,
in charge of the Bank of Spain operation.

16:43.875 --> 16:47.000
-Is something wrong?
-I want you to lead a group in.

16:47.083 --> 16:49.791
Hmm… Negative. I'm on leave.

16:49.875 --> 16:54.083
Sagasta, this is a really,
really bad time to be fucking with me.

16:54.166 --> 16:57.458
-You're familiar with me.
-Yes, that's why I called you.

16:57.541 --> 16:59.416
Afghanistan, Yemen,

16:59.500 --> 17:02.666
the pirates in the Horn of Africa,
Boko Haram…

17:02.750 --> 17:05.125
Do you know
what all those missions have in common?

17:05.208 --> 17:06.291
What? The mosquitoes?

17:06.375 --> 17:09.000
They're undercover operations.
They happen abroad.

17:09.083 --> 17:10.333
There's no witnesses.

17:11.041 --> 17:12.708
Why would I meddle in a civil matter

17:12.791 --> 17:16.250
with Spanish civilians
and the prosecutor's office watching me?

17:16.333 --> 17:18.208
First, because it's an order.

17:18.291 --> 17:20.625
Second, for your country.
Isn't that enough?

17:20.708 --> 17:23.833
They're attacking the national reserve.
You pledged allegiance to the flag!

17:23.916 --> 17:26.500
Listen. Let me tell you
a couple of things, Colonel.

17:26.583 --> 17:27.791
Actually, three things.

17:28.625 --> 17:32.750
Firstly, I couldn't find
the right moment during this conversation

17:32.833 --> 17:34.750
to tell you that I'm taking a shit.

17:34.833 --> 17:36.833
And it doesn't matter now.

17:36.916 --> 17:39.375
Secondly, I'll be there in 40 minutes.

17:39.458 --> 17:43.250
And the last thing, I'll go in
with my operational team that I trust.

17:43.333 --> 17:45.916
The ones from Afghanistan,
Yemen, and Mali.

17:46.416 --> 17:47.458
I want them all.

17:55.291 --> 17:56.750
Tell me what this looks like.

17:59.416 --> 18:00.416
This.

18:18.916 --> 18:20.500
Turn me in to the police.

18:21.166 --> 18:22.000
No.

18:22.791 --> 18:25.083
If I take you to the police,
you'll escape.

18:25.583 --> 18:27.750
If I take you to prison, you'll escape.

18:27.833 --> 18:31.125
Wherever I take you, you've got
a fucking plan and you'll escape.

18:32.416 --> 18:35.916
Tell me. Answer my fucking question.
Where are you taking the gold out?

18:36.000 --> 18:37.750
If you push, you'll never clear your name.

18:37.833 --> 18:39.000
How are you taking it out?

18:39.083 --> 18:41.958
What will you give them?
A smashed corpse, full of bullets?

18:43.375 --> 18:45.708
-Gold.
-They'll think you're completely insane.

18:45.791 --> 18:47.458
Fair enough, bombs away.

19:01.791 --> 19:04.166
You get it now?
Do you grasp the situation?

19:07.666 --> 19:09.083
You're the one who doesn't get it.

19:10.291 --> 19:11.166
I'll never

19:12.000 --> 19:14.666
turn my gang in. Do you get it now? Never!

19:17.166 --> 19:21.041
Listen to me. The plan is designed
to survive any setbacks,

19:21.125 --> 19:22.500
including my death.

19:23.083 --> 19:24.208
So just do it.

19:25.208 --> 19:26.625
So just let me fall!

19:27.333 --> 19:28.833
Or even better, shoot me!

19:28.916 --> 19:32.333
Empty the entire clip on me!
Come on, I can't wait! Just do it!

19:33.458 --> 19:34.291
Come on!

19:37.916 --> 19:39.708
I'd love to.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.166
As soon as they know about Murillo,
and they will,

19:45.250 --> 19:48.375
it'll be like a salad bowl full of shit,
the centerpiece on the table,

19:48.458 --> 19:50.125
and someone will have to eat it.

19:50.208 --> 19:53.083
We can share it. Each of us
would get our own nice little portion.

19:53.166 --> 19:55.625
-Or we can make someone else eat it.
-Who, a cop?

19:55.708 --> 19:58.291
No, Pope Francis. You fucking idiot.

19:58.375 --> 20:00.708
Of course it's a colleague.
A former officer.

20:00.791 --> 20:04.666
A traitor, Sierra. She ran away.
Obviously she's working for the Professor.

20:04.750 --> 20:06.666
-How do we know that?
-I don't know.

20:06.750 --> 20:09.250
It's likely there's a mole here.
It's going to be her.

20:09.333 --> 20:12.666
-We can't assume without proof.
-Proof? What proof?

20:12.750 --> 20:15.500
Proof can be fabricated
when it's for a greater cause.

20:16.541 --> 20:17.791
Are we new to this or what?

20:18.625 --> 20:21.166
Martínez, get a hold
of Sierra's emails, okay?

20:21.250 --> 20:23.875
We need to prove
that she leaked Prieto's conversations

20:23.958 --> 20:25.791
with Osman and the stuff about Algeria.

20:25.875 --> 20:29.375
Create a fake location signal
from her phone, near the National Court.

20:29.458 --> 20:32.166
Irrefutable evidence
of her agreement with Murillo.

20:32.666 --> 20:34.458
I'll need the phone carriers to cooperate.

20:34.541 --> 20:36.958
The phone carriers will do
what CNI tells them to.

20:37.458 --> 20:40.916
Antoñanzas, go to forensics
and stop Nairobi's autopsy.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.125
An army doctor should assume the report.

20:43.208 --> 20:45.458
There should only be
a single bullet wound.

20:46.208 --> 20:47.041
By Gandía.

20:47.125 --> 20:49.541
We'll state that
when Sierra ordered to shoot,

20:49.625 --> 20:52.958
Nairobi was wearing a vest.
Come on, let's set up a farce.

20:54.375 --> 20:56.666
With all that,
I think we're gonna be covered.

20:56.750 --> 20:58.708
Colonel, we're breaking the law.

20:58.791 --> 21:01.000
More than they are.
And I believe in the law.

21:01.500 --> 21:02.750
So I'm leaving.

21:03.458 --> 21:05.833
Where do you think you're going, Calimero?

21:05.916 --> 21:09.000
I'm leaving. If I stay, I'll report anyone
who takes part in this fraud.

21:09.083 --> 21:10.291
Who are you going to report?

21:10.375 --> 21:13.750
The only one who's a fraud here is you!
You found the Professor's hangar.

21:13.833 --> 21:15.833
You could've stopped
his escape but didn't.

21:15.916 --> 21:17.416
Don't try to play Gandhi now!

21:17.500 --> 21:21.166
You better watch what you say to me.
I was waking up from a damn coma!

21:21.666 --> 21:23.291
I have all of your phone recordings.

21:24.333 --> 21:25.583
You seemed a little drunk.

21:28.916 --> 21:30.416
Your phone calls to Murillo.

21:30.500 --> 21:33.958
After 15 years together,
by your side, like a fucking idiot.

21:34.041 --> 21:37.875
She was arrested under your nose
and you didn't have the balls to cooperate

21:37.958 --> 21:40.833
because all you were was her little bitch.
Yes or no?

21:41.875 --> 21:43.250
Answer me, Angelito.

21:45.083 --> 21:47.750
-I'm not answering anything.
-Then get negotiating.

21:47.833 --> 21:51.958
'Cause if you don't, you'll go to prison
before Rio, Tokyo, and Albuquerque.

21:52.041 --> 21:55.250
Okay, you're promoted.
Inspector negotiator. How does that sound?

21:55.333 --> 21:57.083
If you do good,
you can become commissioner.

21:58.500 --> 22:01.083
If I'm gonna be the negotiator,
we'll do it my way.

22:01.166 --> 22:03.000
I'm not gonna do anything illegal, Tamayo.

22:03.083 --> 22:05.375
"I'm not gonna
do anything illegal."

22:05.458 --> 22:08.875
You just negotiate.
We'll do all the hard stuff ourselves.

22:10.166 --> 22:11.041
Colonel.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.750
The helicopter is slowing down.

22:24.208 --> 22:26.375
Ground units will be there
in seven minutes.

22:26.458 --> 22:28.916
Hurry them up.
I wanna block all of the roads.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.833
The air deployment continues.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.541
What's up, Maserati?

23:09.083 --> 23:12.625
Your jumpsuit, the towel, and…

23:13.625 --> 23:15.125
a pair of Helsinki's panties.

23:16.916 --> 23:18.375
It's a fucking joke.

23:19.583 --> 23:20.416
Thank you.

23:20.500 --> 23:22.500
Sorry, I was out of line before.

23:23.583 --> 23:25.125
I just needed to see your reaction.

23:25.750 --> 23:27.416
Mm-hmm. And?

23:27.916 --> 23:29.291
And how did I do?

23:32.791 --> 23:33.875
You don't seem tense.

23:35.541 --> 23:37.000
I know they're coming for us.

23:39.333 --> 23:42.250
But I can't help thinking
this situation is also romantic.

23:42.333 --> 23:43.166
Oh yeah?

23:45.250 --> 23:46.125
How?

23:50.458 --> 23:54.250
He dug a 12-meter tunnel
to get me out of the National Court.

23:55.250 --> 23:59.125
He took me for a ride
all over Madrid in an attack helicopter.

24:00.500 --> 24:03.625
And then, he got me
into the reserve of the Bank of Spain

24:03.708 --> 24:05.666
while 3,000 cops watched.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.166
That's really nice.

24:10.916 --> 24:11.750
Yeah.

24:13.666 --> 24:15.583
In heists, love can get multiplied.

24:16.833 --> 24:17.708
Is that so?

24:19.500 --> 24:20.333
What do you mean?

24:21.916 --> 24:22.750
Well,

24:24.458 --> 24:26.625
'cause every moment
could be your last one.

24:28.375 --> 24:30.958
And all that adrenaline
makes you really feel alive.

24:32.375 --> 24:34.666
You don't wanna leave anything for later.

24:36.333 --> 24:39.791
It does feel a tad more romantic
than going shopping on a Friday.

24:41.541 --> 24:45.541
I've known that ever since the first time
I was kissed in the moment before a heist.

24:48.541 --> 24:49.750
Your heart pounds.

24:49.833 --> 24:51.000
-Ready?
-I'm ready.

24:54.083 --> 24:55.041
You walk in…

24:55.541 --> 24:57.375
Nobody move, motherfuckers!

24:57.458 --> 24:59.125
-Come on, wallets out!
-Fucking hands up!

24:59.208 --> 25:01.041
-Come on, goddamn it! Do it!
-Hands up!

25:01.125 --> 25:02.000
Wallets!

25:02.083 --> 25:03.166
-Hands up!
-Come on!

25:03.250 --> 25:04.708
…and you spread chaos.

25:05.958 --> 25:07.625
Fucking goddess!

25:07.708 --> 25:11.125
Open the fucking cash register!
Come on. Now, now, now!

25:11.833 --> 25:13.875
Get out. Get out of here! Now!

25:13.958 --> 25:15.666
And in the middle of the turmoil…

25:16.250 --> 25:18.416
Come on, come on, come on! Move!

25:18.500 --> 25:22.291
…you look at him in the eyes
and realize you're so fucking happy.

25:22.791 --> 25:23.625
Wallets out!

25:23.708 --> 25:26.708
Come on, come on, come on!
Faster, faster, faster!

25:26.791 --> 25:28.166
Come on, come on, come on!

25:28.875 --> 25:30.416
Yeah!

25:32.125 --> 25:36.041
Leaving with a backpack full of cash,
screaming on the motorcycle.

25:38.833 --> 25:39.666
Feeling…

25:39.750 --> 25:42.666
…indestructible.

25:42.750 --> 25:46.541
And holding him
while driving at 180 kilometers per hour.

25:48.916 --> 25:51.125
You cross the border
and you're in Portugal.

26:03.916 --> 26:05.416
And you stop anywhere,

26:05.916 --> 26:09.166
because you want him so bad
you can't resist it any longer.

26:27.250 --> 26:29.791
You just want to devour time
before it slips away.

26:30.583 --> 26:31.500
And that

26:32.666 --> 26:35.500
makes every moment become so magical.

26:51.333 --> 26:53.791
You're not talking about Rio, are you?

27:05.166 --> 27:06.250
Before him.

27:08.041 --> 27:09.875
He was killed during a heist.

27:17.541 --> 27:18.750
I was there.

27:22.666 --> 27:25.583
After that, I knew
I'd never find a love like that again.

27:30.500 --> 27:32.416
Because he was the love of my life.

27:55.208 --> 27:57.041
Mozart's your favorite composer?

27:57.125 --> 28:00.541
Well, I have to go with,
um, because I'm a massive fan,

28:00.625 --> 28:01.833
uh, Robert Schumann.

28:01.916 --> 28:04.041
Wait until you hear me play Schubert.

28:05.708 --> 28:08.041
Well, I'll have to see that.
I mean, listen to that.

28:09.666 --> 28:11.958
Why didn't you tell me
your son loves Schumann?

28:12.458 --> 28:13.666
He's so cute.

28:14.583 --> 28:17.041
I'm going to the restroom.
Get me more champagne?

28:17.125 --> 28:18.541
Of course, my love.

28:24.416 --> 28:26.333
Were you just checking out my wife?

28:26.916 --> 28:27.791
What?

28:27.875 --> 28:31.541
You think I'm that stupid? You've been
making passes at her all afternoon.

28:31.625 --> 28:34.458
-I'm just being polite to her.
-You're coming onto her.

28:34.541 --> 28:37.750
-Maybe you misunderstood something I did--
-Look me in the eyes.

28:38.541 --> 28:40.708
Do you think she's attractive?

28:41.750 --> 28:44.500
-That's not the point.
-Yes or no, Rafael?

28:44.583 --> 28:46.750
Well, I think she's very… pretty.

28:47.333 --> 28:49.375
Would you make love to my wife?

28:49.875 --> 28:51.875
I'm your father.
I'll know if you're lying.

28:51.958 --> 28:54.916
If the situation wasn't,
uh, like it is right now

28:55.000 --> 28:58.125
and you didn't have a formal,
um, relationship with her, then…

29:01.125 --> 29:03.208
It's flattering that a young man like you

29:03.291 --> 29:05.958
would want to polish
my wife's beautiful thighs.

29:06.541 --> 29:07.833
Would you look at that?

29:08.500 --> 29:11.583
See how confusing life can get sometimes?

29:11.666 --> 29:12.541
Paradoxical.

29:13.583 --> 29:14.458
For example,

29:15.250 --> 29:18.958
I could seem like a good parent
if I wanted to work with my son, but…

29:19.041 --> 29:20.875
if that job were a robbery,

29:20.958 --> 29:23.250
probably some prude asshole
would object to it.

29:23.333 --> 29:25.666
I'll never steal with you
in my life, okay?

29:26.750 --> 29:28.666
-I'm an engineer.
-I know.

29:29.750 --> 29:31.125
Electronics, huh?

29:33.541 --> 29:36.000
With a post degree in cybersecurity.

29:38.416 --> 29:40.208
MIT, Massachusetts.

29:40.916 --> 29:41.833
I paid.

29:45.791 --> 29:47.416
Why do you think I did it?

29:52.875 --> 29:53.708
You…

29:54.958 --> 29:56.125
You are just…

29:57.708 --> 29:59.250
absolutely disgusting

30:00.416 --> 30:01.250
and selfish.

30:01.333 --> 30:04.750
You want a boring life
with schedules, meetings, emails,

30:04.833 --> 30:08.250
with those endless shifts
that will completely exhaust your energy?

30:08.333 --> 30:11.750
Then give you a month-long holiday
so you can get a glimpse of some freedom?

30:11.833 --> 30:14.708
You're gonna want a glimpse of freedom
when you go to prison!

30:16.875 --> 30:19.208
In my job,
you don't get killed or go to jail.

30:19.833 --> 30:22.291
Death is simply just a word, a priori.

30:22.375 --> 30:24.750
It comprises everything
that doesn't exist.

30:25.583 --> 30:29.125
On the other hand, once you're dead,
you won't remember you were alive.

30:29.791 --> 30:32.083
So that's why you wanted to meet, right?

30:33.000 --> 30:35.166
That's why you wanted to see me again?

30:35.666 --> 30:37.958
You say you love me
but don't care if I get killed.

30:38.041 --> 30:41.041
What I don't want is for you to die
before you've even lived.

30:44.208 --> 30:46.041
What I'm offering you right now

30:46.916 --> 30:49.500
is a guaranteed path to liberty.

30:51.125 --> 30:54.000
With me, you'll find authentic liberation.

30:56.583 --> 30:58.833
And if we ever have to pay a price for it,

31:00.583 --> 31:01.541
then we pay it.

31:14.875 --> 31:17.041
Madrid is not the Bermuda Triangle.

31:17.541 --> 31:20.708
We can't make
an 11-ton helicopter simply disappear.

31:20.791 --> 31:24.166
And Marseille will be watched
by all their radars, their satellites,

31:24.250 --> 31:26.041
even NATO's ballistic missiles.

31:26.125 --> 31:28.291
So as soon as Marseille drops off Lisbon…

31:30.708 --> 31:31.875
he'll have nowhere to go.

31:31.958 --> 31:33.666
The helicopter's descending.

31:33.750 --> 31:35.750
-Where is it?
-It's in the countryside.

31:35.833 --> 31:37.791
Near Guadalajara.
It looks like a cattle farm.

31:37.875 --> 31:40.583
-Helicopter's landing!
-Transferring coordinates.

31:45.333 --> 31:46.666
The coordinates, hurry up.

31:46.750 --> 31:49.541
Forty degrees,
33 minutes, 47 seconds, north.

31:49.625 --> 31:52.333
Three degrees,
12 minutes, 34 seconds, due west.

32:32.041 --> 32:35.833
You'll be getting your wife out of trouble
but putting Marseille in a tight spot.

32:35.916 --> 32:37.708
That would be the case, Benjamín,

32:37.791 --> 32:42.250
if it wasn't for the continuation
of our astonishing illusionist act.

32:42.333 --> 32:43.333
Police!

32:45.416 --> 32:47.208
Get to the helicopter!

32:48.500 --> 32:49.875
On the ground!

32:50.916 --> 32:53.083
-I'm the owner of the farm.
-On the ground!

32:53.708 --> 32:56.666
-On the ground! Hands on your head!
-Get on the ground!

33:04.416 --> 33:05.250
Clear!

33:05.916 --> 33:07.375
-Clear!
-Clear!

33:08.583 --> 33:13.541
A guilty person
would never claim damages and losses

33:13.625 --> 33:16.916
in such an indignant, obsessive…

33:17.000 --> 33:19.333
-They've killed my lambs.
-Shut your mouth!

33:20.416 --> 33:21.250
…irritating way.

33:21.333 --> 33:22.208
On your feet!

33:22.291 --> 33:25.541
Your colleague killed my lamb.
Who's gonna pay for it? Huh? Who?

33:25.625 --> 33:27.708
I don't know who did this.
Just stay quiet!

33:27.791 --> 33:30.250
-Who the fuck is that?
-Someone who lost a lamb.

33:30.333 --> 33:33.291
He landed on my flock
at a crazy speed. He's nuts!

33:33.375 --> 33:34.500
He was alone?

33:34.583 --> 33:37.333
In the helicopter? Yes, he was alone.

33:37.833 --> 33:38.958
In the car…

33:39.458 --> 33:42.625
Boris, in the car, how many were there?
Two, right?

33:42.708 --> 33:46.208
No, just one. They both left,
but there was only one guy in the car.

33:46.708 --> 33:47.791
The vehicle model?

33:47.875 --> 33:50.375
It was like, uh, a funeral car.

33:50.458 --> 33:54.083
In that moment,
they'll have only one lead, the red Volvo.

33:54.916 --> 33:59.958
The cameras back at the National Court
will record it when we get Lisbon out.

34:02.000 --> 34:05.333
And that will be
the exact information you'll give them.

34:06.375 --> 34:09.000
Ask him if it was
a Volvo from the '90s. A red one.

34:09.083 --> 34:09.916
Was it a Volvo?

34:10.000 --> 34:12.625
A red station wagon.
The make? I don't know.

34:12.708 --> 34:15.916
Volvo, yeah, Volvo.
It left towards Albolleque.

34:16.000 --> 34:19.333
That will be the climax
of our act of illusionism,

34:20.041 --> 34:21.916
because from that moment on…

34:23.958 --> 34:26.250
…everything will change.

34:26.333 --> 34:28.208
We've got them. It's them.

34:28.291 --> 34:34.833
All units, the suspect's in
a Volvo Polar 240, plate number 15318 VCM.

34:34.916 --> 34:36.958
-Captain.
-I'm listening, Colonel.

34:37.041 --> 34:39.416
-Get on the same route and stay on them.
-Copy that.

34:39.500 --> 34:42.166
Miranda, you stay here.
Everyone, we're leaving. Go!

34:54.583 --> 34:56.250
Open communication.

35:24.416 --> 35:26.416
Squad, update me on the situation.

35:26.500 --> 35:29.625
-It's two kilometers away.
-We have to stop that car.

35:29.708 --> 35:32.708
Attention, suspect vehicle
approaching at 1,500 meters.

35:34.166 --> 35:35.125
Come on, come on!

35:36.333 --> 35:38.416
Suspect vehicle approaching
at 1,000 meters.

35:38.500 --> 35:40.458
Careful, everyone. This is the Professor.

35:40.541 --> 35:43.541
He could have a smoke bomb
or God knows what. He's fucking Houdini.

35:48.583 --> 35:51.500
Vehicle approaching
at 500 meters. Increasing speed.

35:53.416 --> 35:55.208
We have visual. Ready to fire.

35:57.875 --> 36:01.458
Stop the vehicle!
Stop the car, you son of a bitch!

36:01.541 --> 36:03.833
-Shoot the wheels off the fucking car!
-Fire!

36:10.708 --> 36:12.083
Exit the vehicle!

36:13.625 --> 36:15.250
Get out, now!

36:15.833 --> 36:17.500
Out of the fucking car!

36:17.583 --> 36:19.125
Get out of the car!

36:21.541 --> 36:23.166
Explosives!

36:23.250 --> 36:24.500
On the ground!

36:24.583 --> 36:26.000
What's going on?

36:26.083 --> 36:27.708
They've got my wife!

36:28.333 --> 36:30.125
-Is it the Professor?
-We were kidnapped.

36:30.208 --> 36:32.166
We were coming out of the salon.

36:35.333 --> 36:37.875
A woman was kidnapped
on her way out of the salon.

36:39.416 --> 36:42.208
We should make a report
or else no one will pay for my lamb.

36:42.291 --> 36:45.916
Just shut the fuck up
and go back to doing your work.

36:46.000 --> 36:47.583
After, while you're pretending

36:47.666 --> 36:50.041
that you're going back
to your work on the farm…

36:50.125 --> 36:52.583
Come on, we should go feed the cattle now.

36:54.458 --> 36:55.625
…we'll leave.

37:00.041 --> 37:02.666
Looks like
we've been tricked again, Colonel.

37:42.791 --> 37:44.708
MUSEUM OF GOLD

37:49.541 --> 37:52.250
What about all this gold,
are we not gonna melt it too?

37:54.208 --> 37:57.583
This gold was stolen once.
It can't be stolen again.

37:57.666 --> 38:00.750
It belongs to the Quimbayas,
the Incas, the Quechuas…

38:01.708 --> 38:05.250
If anything, we should give it back,
don't you think? It's a treasure.

38:05.333 --> 38:06.791
Well, treasure is treasure.

38:07.291 --> 38:09.833
My son could have made one of these,
and he's two.

38:09.916 --> 38:11.750
-Think about it.
-Come on, Denver.

38:23.916 --> 38:24.833
Lisbon to Professor.

38:24.916 --> 38:26.708
Hurry up.

38:26.791 --> 38:30.166
-Hurry up. They'll be worried.
-Professor, check-up call.

38:44.750 --> 38:46.250
I'm here.

38:46.916 --> 38:47.791
Hi, Sergio.

38:49.250 --> 38:50.833
Plan Paris was a success.

38:50.916 --> 38:52.375
We're launching Plan Rome.

38:52.875 --> 38:54.833
In an hour, we'll start the extraction.

38:57.791 --> 38:59.208
There will be no extraction.

39:04.333 --> 39:06.750
It's possible this is the last time
I'll speak to all of you.

39:10.333 --> 39:12.208
The stormwater tank has been discovered.

39:12.291 --> 39:15.875
What happens
if someone finds the stormwater tank?

39:21.000 --> 39:22.083
It's the finale.

39:22.166 --> 39:23.458
Hi, Lisbon.

39:25.000 --> 39:26.791
Hey, Tokyo, Helsinki…

39:26.875 --> 39:31.333
Well, hello to every single one
of those cities you're named after

39:31.416 --> 39:33.166
but will never have the chance to visit.

39:33.250 --> 39:34.291
Who's that?

39:34.375 --> 39:35.500
It's Inspector Sierra.

39:36.000 --> 39:39.916
-She's in charge of the investigation.
-Something like that. What's up, Raquel?

39:40.000 --> 39:43.583
I guess you're in the middle
of an emotional roller coaster, right?

39:43.666 --> 39:46.375
Earlier… you were arrested in the tent.

39:46.458 --> 39:49.375
Then you were flying around
like a little bird, right? Free.

39:49.458 --> 39:51.125
And suddenly it hits you, bang!

39:53.041 --> 39:53.875
Everything's over.

39:55.541 --> 39:57.666
But we both knew all of this had a price.

39:58.375 --> 39:59.208
Well,

40:00.208 --> 40:01.958
the time has come to pay it.

40:02.041 --> 40:04.208
The price could be really high, Dad.

40:04.875 --> 40:06.958
Because when it's time to pay,
you're not here,

40:07.541 --> 40:09.916
in a luxury restaurant,
eating a lobster, no.

40:11.000 --> 40:12.291
You're in a police van.

40:12.875 --> 40:15.083
And your life,
everything you've built, just…

40:16.750 --> 40:17.750
disappears.

40:19.958 --> 40:22.750
Or worse, you're covered in blood, dead…

40:25.416 --> 40:26.791
like your father, remember?

40:29.958 --> 40:33.708
The things that are really important
in life, Rafael, have a high price.

40:35.583 --> 40:36.583
Rebellion.

40:39.000 --> 40:40.125
Liberty.

40:41.250 --> 40:42.166
Ideals.

40:42.250 --> 40:44.208
Do you have any last words, Professor?

41:05.750 --> 41:06.666
I'm sorry, Raquel.

41:12.708 --> 41:14.083
I'm really sorry, Rio.

41:16.666 --> 41:18.250
I'm so sorry, Palermo.

41:22.416 --> 41:24.250
I'm really sorry, Helsinki.

41:28.708 --> 41:29.916
I'm sorry, Manila.

41:34.416 --> 41:35.791
I'm sorry, Bogotá.

41:40.375 --> 41:41.958
I'm really sorry, Stockholm.

41:46.500 --> 41:47.750
I'm sorry, Denver.

41:54.333 --> 41:55.666
I'm really sorry, Tokyo.

41:58.250 --> 42:00.041
-I'm really so sorry.
-Enough.

42:00.583 --> 42:01.541
Hey. That's enough.

42:03.208 --> 42:04.125
Professor,

42:05.291 --> 42:07.000
don't feel so bad, hmm?

42:07.833 --> 42:10.333
There are no big battles
without big opponents.

42:12.791 --> 42:15.458
And I mean, you guys,
I could talk for hours.

42:15.541 --> 42:17.833
We could do a group therapy session

42:17.916 --> 42:20.208
or we could talk about
all your clever tactics,

42:20.291 --> 42:22.041
like the ferret through the sewers.

42:22.125 --> 42:23.875
Hilarious.

42:23.958 --> 42:26.583
But the thing is,
we have a lot to discuss over here.

42:26.666 --> 42:29.041
Okay? Over and out, my cute gangsters.

42:48.791 --> 42:52.666
There's got to be a plan B.
The Professor always has plan B.

42:52.750 --> 42:54.000
Not this time.

42:54.083 --> 42:55.250
There's no plan B.

42:55.750 --> 42:57.541
He's so arrogant he doesn't have a plan B?

42:57.625 --> 43:00.208
He has one for everything,
but not in case he fails?

43:00.833 --> 43:02.375
I don't think he's that stupid.

43:02.458 --> 43:05.666
What would you suggest?
There's only one way to get the gold out.

43:05.750 --> 43:08.500
There's no plan B
because only plan A can work.

43:18.375 --> 43:19.791
We're up against the ropes.

43:20.916 --> 43:23.000
But we're not gonna end up in the morgue.

43:27.000 --> 43:28.458
The army!

43:31.250 --> 43:32.458
The military.

43:32.541 --> 43:34.083
A lot of soldiers.

43:42.125 --> 43:44.916
In that moment,
it felt as if we were hitting a wall

43:45.000 --> 43:47.166
at 150 kilometers per hour.

43:47.250 --> 43:48.750
The end of the road.

44:00.875 --> 44:03.666
We all experience that
at some point in our lives.

44:06.416 --> 44:09.708
One day your brother
is diagnosed with a terminal illness.

44:16.458 --> 44:20.208
One day you realize
you won't ever see your child again.

44:28.291 --> 44:30.250
That you won't see your friends again.

44:32.708 --> 44:34.250
Or your unrequited love.

44:36.625 --> 44:37.583
Papa.

44:39.791 --> 44:42.541
Or that you'll never hug
your father again.

44:46.250 --> 44:47.583
René!

44:47.666 --> 44:48.666
René!

44:49.458 --> 44:52.166
Other days,
you're leaving a bank with your boyfriend

44:52.250 --> 44:54.166
and a bullet takes him away from you.

44:54.250 --> 44:56.125
No!

44:56.625 --> 44:57.708
Your family…

44:59.666 --> 45:01.000
won't ever see each other again.

45:02.375 --> 45:05.416
Everything we experienced
while dressed in red

45:06.458 --> 45:07.750
was coming to a close.

45:08.458 --> 45:11.541
This was the end of our journey together.
