WEBVTT

00:01.409 --> 00:02.890
Previously on "2 Broke Girls"...

00:02.891 --> 00:05.387
I am choosing to take
this disaster as a sign,

00:05.388 --> 00:07.033
and while they're rebuilding this place

00:07.034 --> 00:10.357
I'm gonna go surprise
Randy and try to rebuild us!

00:10.358 --> 00:12.359
Fine, use my car,

00:12.360 --> 00:14.862
but I'm going to be driving
it. I'm coming with you.

00:14.863 --> 00:16.931
I finally got the gas pedal extension

00:16.932 --> 00:17.865
where I like it.

00:17.866 --> 00:19.800
I'll just call AAA.

00:19.801 --> 00:21.202
Cool. Later, hater.

00:21.203 --> 00:23.103
Wait, you're really leaving?

00:23.104 --> 00:26.140
Who leaves someone on
the side of the road

00:26.141 --> 00:27.164
in the middle of nowhere?

00:27.165 --> 00:28.475
My friend, Sloppy Joe,

00:28.476 --> 00:30.144
has a one-engine plane.

00:30.145 --> 00:32.079
He might be able to fly
y'all all the way to LA.

00:32.080 --> 00:34.048
Well, that's a wrap on
the first day of filming

00:34.049 --> 00:35.115
here in Austin, Texas.

00:35.116 --> 00:37.318
So Randy's not in Los Angeles?

00:37.319 --> 00:38.786
He's in Texas?

00:38.787 --> 00:41.088
Wow, you're a bad stalker, Max.

00:41.089 --> 00:43.457
There's two things the Slop won't do.

00:43.458 --> 00:45.759
Alert the proper authorities
of my flight pattern

00:45.760 --> 00:48.128
or step foot in Texas.

00:48.129 --> 00:49.129
I'll drop you here.

00:55.436 --> 00:57.771
When I agreed to
follow you cross-country

00:57.772 --> 00:59.340
to chase your ex-boyfriend,

00:59.341 --> 01:02.142
I didn't realize I'd be
thrown out of a plane,

01:02.143 --> 01:04.311
scavenging for my belongings

01:04.312 --> 01:06.747
and fighting a snake
for my favorite pants.

01:08.016 --> 01:10.317
You can have them, sir!

01:10.318 --> 01:12.853
Ah! Found my toothbrush.

01:12.854 --> 01:16.357
Max, that's disgusting.

01:16.358 --> 01:18.459
Oh, you're right. This isn't mine.

01:18.460 --> 01:21.128
Ah, found a purse...

01:21.129 --> 01:23.430
Under this syringe.

01:23.431 --> 01:24.665
Anything in there?

01:24.666 --> 01:26.267
Uh...

01:26.268 --> 01:28.035
nah, pretty tapped out,

01:28.036 --> 01:29.536
which is too bad

01:29.537 --> 01:31.438
'cause you could use
a two-day heroin nap.

01:31.439 --> 01:32.840
I meant my bag.

01:32.841 --> 01:34.441
Look what else survived!

01:34.442 --> 01:35.376
Ah-ha!

01:35.377 --> 01:38.812
My Popchips!

01:38.813 --> 01:41.949
Only to meet an unfortunate end.

01:41.950 --> 01:44.318
Oh, no, Max, my wallet.

01:44.319 --> 01:46.320
Mm, yeah, I know. You've aged a lot

01:46.321 --> 01:47.521
since that license picture.

01:47.522 --> 01:49.223
No, it's gone.

01:49.224 --> 01:50.724
All of our cash

01:50.725 --> 01:52.993
and our credit cards were in there.

01:52.994 --> 01:54.828
What are we gonna do? I'm freaking out.

01:54.829 --> 01:57.231
Nah, nah, nah, calm down.

01:57.232 --> 02:00.000
Caroline will get us out of this.

02:00.001 --> 02:02.236
Oh, wait. You're Caroline.

02:02.237 --> 02:04.138
I'm calling the diner for help.

02:04.139 --> 02:07.141
Han...

02:07.142 --> 02:09.743
Caroline, we don't
have a good connection,

02:09.744 --> 02:12.346
and not just because
we're dueling Scorpios.

02:12.347 --> 02:13.981
Peek-a-boo!

02:13.982 --> 02:16.583
I see you!

02:16.584 --> 02:18.085
Oleg.

02:18.086 --> 02:20.019
All right, now do it with Barbara.

02:26.093 --> 02:27.761
Han, we had all of our belongings

02:27.762 --> 02:29.897
thrown out of a private plane.

02:29.898 --> 02:31.665
Caroline, you're cutting out.

02:31.666 --> 02:35.502
All I heard was "private
plane." Brag much?

02:35.503 --> 02:38.005
No, we need to get to Texas,

02:38.006 --> 02:41.875
so can you please put
$500 in my PayPal account?

02:41.876 --> 02:44.678
What? You have $500?

02:44.679 --> 02:46.380
Did I call you to gloat

02:46.381 --> 02:48.849
when I bought this snazzy new vest?

02:48.850 --> 02:50.451
I'm putting you on speaker.

02:50.452 --> 02:52.195
Private plane...

02:52.196 --> 02:54.455
Have... credit card...

02:55.557 --> 02:57.124
We lost her.

02:57.125 --> 03:00.294
Or maybe her butler
snatched her phone from her.

03:00.295 --> 03:01.395
Oh, God.

03:01.396 --> 03:03.797
He hung up.

03:03.798 --> 03:06.633
Max, can we just go back to
that terrible place we call home?

03:06.634 --> 03:09.470
That mountain lion is
wearing my new blouse.

03:09.471 --> 03:12.139
And here she comes!

03:12.140 --> 03:16.010
Keep the tags on if you wanna return it.

03:19.748 --> 03:24.851
Subtitle sync and corrections by
<font color="#33FF00"><b>awaqeded</b></font> for <font color="#33FF00"><b>www.addic7ed.com.</b></font>

03:32.047 --> 03:33.448
I'm calling the credit card company

03:33.449 --> 03:34.616
to send us new cards.

03:34.617 --> 03:36.385
They're used to hearing me cry.

03:36.386 --> 03:38.220
So is the unfortunate family

03:38.221 --> 03:40.088
that sat behind us at "Zootopia."

03:40.089 --> 03:42.891
If animals can all get along, so can we.

03:42.892 --> 03:45.427
Look, once we get our cards,

03:45.428 --> 03:47.262
we'll be on our way to Randy in Texas...

03:47.263 --> 03:49.565
and what was in this for me again?

03:49.566 --> 03:51.298
5 1/2 near-death experiences?

03:53.669 --> 03:56.738
Hi, Visa. It's me, Caroline.

03:56.739 --> 03:59.874
My cards were stolen.

04:01.310 --> 04:03.545
I've seen backs of vans

04:03.546 --> 04:05.113
with better candy selections.

04:05.114 --> 04:08.584
This is a disgrace to
the name Gas and Gobble.

04:08.585 --> 04:10.652
How do you even wake up in the morning?

04:10.653 --> 04:12.588
My alligator licks my face.

04:12.589 --> 04:14.923
Oh, my God, Max.

04:14.924 --> 04:17.826
Whoever stole our credit
cards maxed them out.

04:17.827 --> 04:20.329
They spent the $1,500 we had left.

04:20.329 --> 04:21.829
No way.

04:21.831 --> 04:23.432
Someone just spent $1,500

04:23.433 --> 04:25.233
on phone cards and cigarettes.

04:25.234 --> 04:27.102
His name was Caroline Channing.

04:27.103 --> 04:28.236
What?

04:28.237 --> 04:29.504
That's my name!

04:29.505 --> 04:31.607
Ah, you got a dude's name.

04:31.608 --> 04:34.343
Ugh, we were robbed. Police!

04:34.344 --> 04:36.111
Where!

04:36.112 --> 04:38.926
Max, I am tired and I'm hungry

04:38.927 --> 04:40.393
and I can't find a mirror,

04:40.394 --> 04:43.129
but I am sensing a
disturbance in my hair.

04:43.130 --> 04:44.864
We have to go home!

04:44.865 --> 04:46.800
But we have to go to Texas.

04:46.801 --> 04:48.301
Randy needs me.

04:48.302 --> 04:50.035
He's saying it on his Snapchat story.

04:51.638 --> 04:53.073
Still on the movie set.

04:53.074 --> 04:55.008
Pretty lonely, so if
anyone would respond

04:55.009 --> 04:56.409
to my Words With Friends request,

04:56.410 --> 04:57.744
I promise to let you win,

04:57.745 --> 05:00.080
and if you're ever in Texas...

05:00.081 --> 05:01.313
why?

05:02.582 --> 05:06.086
See? He's begging me to come there.

05:06.087 --> 05:08.989
But we have no money to get to Texas.

05:08.990 --> 05:10.389
Wrong.

05:11.524 --> 05:15.128
I've got $11 in this one

05:15.129 --> 05:19.432
and $32 in this one.

05:19.433 --> 05:21.900
Lefty's been holding back as per usual.

05:23.103 --> 05:25.005
So your 43 boob dollars

05:25.006 --> 05:26.506
are gonna get us to Texas?

05:26.507 --> 05:29.009
Don't rule out my roll of butt quarters.

05:29.010 --> 05:30.610
Sweaty but ready.

05:30.611 --> 05:32.212
All right, can y'all folks lock up?

05:32.213 --> 05:34.214
I got to make a riverboat

05:34.215 --> 05:35.782
before it takes off to New Orleans.

05:35.783 --> 05:37.550
My cousin Tim put a voodoo curse on me.

05:37.551 --> 05:39.285
I got to talk to him about removing it.

05:39.286 --> 05:40.954
Caroline,

05:40.955 --> 05:43.690
New Orleans is close to Texas.

05:43.691 --> 05:46.493
The Hamburglar says so
on my McDonald's placemat,

05:46.494 --> 05:47.994
and he would never lie

05:47.995 --> 05:50.530
unless it's about stealing
delicious hamburgers.

05:50.531 --> 05:53.066
I'm confused. Do you want hamburgers

05:53.067 --> 05:54.530
or do you wanna take that riverboat?

05:54.531 --> 05:56.831
Obviously, the dream scenario is both.

06:00.140 --> 06:02.042
Ah, thank you very much.

06:02.043 --> 06:04.044
Max, people have tickets.

06:04.045 --> 06:05.812
You have to pay to get on this...

06:05.813 --> 06:09.749
what I'm positive will be my
sixth near-death experience.

06:09.750 --> 06:11.317
So bend over and unclench.

06:11.318 --> 06:13.253
We need those butt quarters.

06:13.254 --> 06:15.687
Who are you? My mother
at a church carnival?

06:16.856 --> 06:18.925
Have your tickets ready, please.

06:18.926 --> 06:21.394
All we have to do is act like we belong.

06:21.395 --> 06:25.198
Do I at least get to have
an adorable Southern accent?

06:25.199 --> 06:26.499
No accent.

06:26.500 --> 06:28.203
Well, I do declare

06:28.204 --> 06:31.404
that is mighty disappointing.

06:31.405 --> 06:34.007
Just follow my lead. It's
time to touch strangers.

06:34.008 --> 06:37.042
Hey, you got a permit for those guns?

06:39.546 --> 06:42.449
Well, I say,

06:42.450 --> 06:44.517
you got a permit for

06:44.518 --> 06:46.485
that light-up yo-yo?

06:47.454 --> 06:48.754
I have a girlfriend.

06:50.423 --> 06:51.890
Keep walking, buster.

06:58.765 --> 07:01.701
Max, the riverboat doesn't
get to New Orleans for two days

07:01.702 --> 07:03.403
and we have nowhere to sleep.

07:03.404 --> 07:04.904
Ooh, but there is

07:04.905 --> 07:07.307
a "Whittle Your Own
Banjo" workshop at 5:00.

07:07.308 --> 07:09.309
I have whittle-to-no interest in that.

07:09.310 --> 07:12.479
Ooh, it says they have
the loosest slots around.

07:12.480 --> 07:14.581
I guess the Darby sisters
from my hometown are here.

07:14.582 --> 07:17.083
I did see a bunch of lounge chairs

07:17.084 --> 07:18.651
over by the swamp exhibit.

07:18.652 --> 07:20.155
I guess we could sleep there tonight,

07:20.156 --> 07:21.488
and then the next night,

07:21.489 --> 07:23.089
well, hopefully we'll be dead.

07:23.090 --> 07:24.824
Come on, red!

07:24.825 --> 07:26.448
Max, no! That's all of our money!

07:26.449 --> 07:27.460
No more bets.

07:27.461 --> 07:29.629
Oh, that is so stupid,

07:29.630 --> 07:31.097
and not cute stupid like

07:31.098 --> 07:32.899
when you thought Velcro grew in nature.

07:32.900 --> 07:34.634
And red is the winner.

07:34.635 --> 07:37.470
Well, rootin' tootin'!

07:37.471 --> 07:40.607
I always bet on red because
my last name's Black,

07:40.608 --> 07:41.975
and that's ah-not been a winner.

07:41.976 --> 07:43.977
Okay, now that we've doubled our money,

07:43.978 --> 07:45.521
- maybe we should stop.
- Come on, red!

07:46.247 --> 07:47.947
- No more bets.
- No!

07:47.948 --> 07:50.416
I didn't even get to touch
it before you lost it.

07:50.417 --> 07:51.985
Why do you hate having things?

07:51.986 --> 07:53.620
Red again.

07:53.621 --> 07:56.790
Just call me Al Roker
'cause I'm making it rain.

07:56.791 --> 08:00.293
Max, we're winning at something.

08:01.661 --> 08:03.444
Don't just stand there
looking pretty, toots.

08:03.445 --> 08:04.430
Order daddy some wings.

08:04.431 --> 08:07.834
Oh, my God, I look pretty

08:07.835 --> 08:10.537
and I get to flag down a waitress.

08:10.538 --> 08:11.638
Waitress!

08:11.639 --> 08:13.439
I'll have a sarsaparilla

08:13.440 --> 08:14.874
and some wings for big daddy.

08:16.110 --> 08:17.944
Sophie's calling.

08:17.945 --> 08:19.411
Pfft, like I'm gonna get it.

08:22.148 --> 08:24.984
Well, Caroline's not answering.

08:24.985 --> 08:27.187
Executive decision.

08:27.188 --> 08:30.156
Horses can eat a bunch of pudding.

08:30.157 --> 08:32.993
My cousin from Chernobyl
had a dog this size.

08:32.994 --> 08:34.660
He had three legs.

08:34.662 --> 08:37.163
My cousin, not the dog.

08:37.164 --> 08:40.667
Something good did
come out of Chernobyl.

08:40.668 --> 08:42.402
Excuse me?

08:42.403 --> 08:44.203
How much do you charge
for pictures with him?

08:44.205 --> 08:46.039
Oh, it depends.

08:46.040 --> 08:48.675
How nude do you want him?

08:48.676 --> 08:50.376
Ew.

08:50.377 --> 08:51.744
We mean for our kids...

08:51.745 --> 08:53.213
with the horse.

08:53.214 --> 08:56.482
I don't think the "ew" was necessary.

08:56.483 --> 08:59.052
You don't know what you're missing.

08:59.053 --> 09:01.921
I mean, we're just
walking him for our friend.

09:01.922 --> 09:03.224
We'll give you $10 each.

09:03.225 --> 09:05.191
Sold to the woman who...

09:05.192 --> 09:07.392
"Doesn't" wanna see me naked.

09:09.000 --> 09:15.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:19.910 --> 09:21.578
Come on, 18!

09:21.579 --> 09:24.648
Which is also the title
of my adult film debut.

09:24.649 --> 09:26.083
Mine would have been called,

09:26.084 --> 09:27.850
"Might As Well, I'm 24."

09:28.985 --> 09:30.587
Excuse me, Mr. Moustache?

09:30.588 --> 09:33.556
Could you stop feeling
my ankle with your toes?

09:34.825 --> 09:37.627
I guess that's a no.

09:37.628 --> 09:39.596
Oh, 18 winner.

09:39.597 --> 09:41.465
We won! I'm rich!

09:41.466 --> 09:43.100
Now you have no shot with me.

09:43.101 --> 09:45.669
Stay close, sweet
cakes. You're good luck.

09:45.670 --> 09:48.305
Here, buddy. Buy
yourself some new sandals,

09:48.306 --> 09:50.340
and a round of mouthwash for the table.

09:50.341 --> 09:52.776
All right, place your bets.

09:52.777 --> 09:55.345
I placed mine on a liberal arts degree.

09:55.346 --> 09:56.513
That's why I'm here.

09:56.514 --> 09:58.648
Let it ride.

09:58.649 --> 10:00.851
Max, maybe we should
quit while we're ahead

10:00.852 --> 10:02.352
since we've never been before.

10:02.353 --> 10:03.854
Aren't you worried that we might...

10:03.855 --> 10:05.122
18 again!

10:05.123 --> 10:08.058
Keep winning and never die!

10:08.059 --> 10:09.459
Let's go with four.

10:09.460 --> 10:11.395
The number of men who have flashed me

10:11.396 --> 10:12.796
since I've been on this riverboat.

10:12.797 --> 10:14.730
Lucky four!

10:15.799 --> 10:17.033
No more bets.

10:17.034 --> 10:19.869
Whoa!

10:20.971 --> 10:22.072
Who's driving this thing?

10:22.073 --> 10:23.173
Gary Busey?

10:23.174 --> 10:25.976
Oh, four. No winners.

10:25.977 --> 10:28.678
Yes, winners. We had four,

10:28.679 --> 10:30.213
but then the boat moved our chips.

10:30.214 --> 10:32.048
Yeah, and it also spilled my soda.

10:32.049 --> 10:35.051
So like I said: No winners.

10:35.052 --> 10:36.520
Sure, we lost all our money,

10:36.521 --> 10:38.354
but at least you got to see some dongs.

10:42.092 --> 10:44.327
Hey, Sophie, it's me Car... ah!

10:44.328 --> 10:45.729
I fall for her...

10:45.730 --> 10:47.330
"Hello, this is Sophie"

10:47.331 --> 10:49.733
outgoing message every time.

10:49.734 --> 10:52.602
We need them to send that money.

10:52.603 --> 10:54.204
Oh, thank God. Hi, Sophie, it's...

10:55.740 --> 10:58.675
What's going on here?

10:58.676 --> 11:01.211
Are you selling pony
rides with Chestnut?

11:01.212 --> 11:04.681
Yes, but you got to wait
in line with the other kids.

11:04.682 --> 11:06.917
No, you don't, buddy.

11:06.918 --> 11:08.117
Up you go, champ.

11:09.419 --> 11:11.288
Get your hands off me!

11:11.289 --> 11:15.292
I don't want my picture taken!

11:15.293 --> 11:16.960
Right now.

11:16.961 --> 11:19.863
The girls asked me to make
sure you're feeding him,

11:19.864 --> 11:21.898
and here you are pimping him out

11:21.899 --> 11:23.233
like...

11:23.234 --> 11:25.035
this isn't my wheelhouse.

11:25.036 --> 11:26.269
Famous pimps, anyone?

11:26.270 --> 11:27.904
What?

11:27.905 --> 11:30.207
How dare they not trust us.

11:30.208 --> 11:32.943
This stops now!

11:32.944 --> 11:35.412
Unless your boy, Han,

11:35.413 --> 11:37.314
gets a little taste of the horse-play.

11:37.315 --> 11:39.315
Here.

11:40.717 --> 11:42.319
What's going on here?

11:42.320 --> 11:43.653
Nothing.

11:43.654 --> 11:46.389
I know a shady deal when I see one.

11:46.390 --> 11:50.260
I was one of the loudest voices
against the Louisiana Purchase.

11:50.261 --> 11:52.462
Earl, what are you even doing here?

11:52.463 --> 11:54.130
I thought you lived at the diner.

11:54.131 --> 11:57.067
Well, thank God the girls
asked me to check on Han

11:57.068 --> 11:58.468
checking on you too

11:58.469 --> 11:59.970
'cause now this black male

11:59.971 --> 12:01.638
is about to blackmail you.

12:02.840 --> 12:04.908
Okay, Earl's in too.

12:04.909 --> 12:07.677
At a lesser percentage because odds are

12:07.678 --> 12:09.545
he'll forget about all
of this momentarily.

12:10.747 --> 12:12.749
Excuse me, manager.

12:12.750 --> 12:14.084
We've been wronged,

12:14.085 --> 12:15.852
and not just generally by life.

12:15.853 --> 12:17.621
I don't know who to
complain to about that.

12:17.622 --> 12:20.156
Is there a problem over here?

12:20.157 --> 12:21.458
I'm the pit boss.

12:21.459 --> 12:23.293
I also do the mentalist show

12:23.294 --> 12:24.677
in the John Wilkes Booth Ballroom.

12:24.678 --> 12:26.530
Still lots of tickets available.

12:26.531 --> 12:28.431
Yes, there's a problem here.

12:28.432 --> 12:30.166
We just got cheated out of our winnings,

12:30.167 --> 12:32.502
and I was already cheated
out of much of my 20s,

12:32.503 --> 12:35.105
but again, probably not your department.

12:35.106 --> 12:38.308
Why don't I send a
complimentary bottle of champagne

12:38.309 --> 12:39.476
to your room?

12:39.477 --> 12:41.111
And by "champagne" I mean wine,

12:41.112 --> 12:42.546
and by "bottle" I mean box.

12:42.547 --> 12:45.315
Uh, you know what? We'll take it here.

12:45.316 --> 12:47.817
Would there happen to
be a 7 Eleven Merlot?

12:47.818 --> 12:50.954
Max, wine in our room
sounds so much better.

12:50.955 --> 12:52.622
We can relax

12:52.623 --> 12:54.324
and focus on each other for once.

12:54.325 --> 12:56.091
Mm, great. What's the room number?

12:57.060 --> 12:58.828
Oh.

12:58.829 --> 13:02.232
I think she means oh-six.

13:02.233 --> 13:03.667
I don't think so.

13:03.668 --> 13:05.569
That room is still
an active crime scene.

13:06.904 --> 13:08.638
Stowaways, huh?

13:08.639 --> 13:10.502
I'll have the Coast Guard
come and pick you up.

13:10.503 --> 13:12.042
They're already coming for that guy.

13:12.043 --> 13:13.543
I didn't wanna strip my clothes off

13:13.544 --> 13:14.607
and try to drive the boat.

13:14.608 --> 13:15.879
It was that voodoo curse.

13:15.880 --> 13:17.346
Damn you, Tim!

13:18.848 --> 13:21.551
Look, dude, if you're
really a mentalist,

13:21.552 --> 13:24.154
you'll know that I need to get
to Texas to see my boyfriend.

13:25.690 --> 13:27.857
I can tell that you're
telling the truth.

13:27.858 --> 13:30.894
Please, there has got to be a
way we can work something out.

13:30.895 --> 13:32.362
We'll do anything.

13:32.363 --> 13:34.731
Well, she will. I'll
do over the shirt stuff.

13:34.732 --> 13:35.899
Your shirt.

13:35.900 --> 13:38.467
If you take off that hat.

13:43.907 --> 13:46.109
Is there anywhere in the world

13:46.110 --> 13:49.179
where I don't have to be a waitress?

13:49.180 --> 13:50.412
Hooters?

13:51.748 --> 13:52.815
Thanks.

14:03.076 --> 14:06.512
I'm a cocktail waitress
on the Mississippi River.

14:06.513 --> 14:07.880
This is a worse vacation

14:07.881 --> 14:09.848
than the one with Ed Helms in it.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.185
Sorry, sir.

14:12.186 --> 14:13.486
Looking for some cell service.

14:13.487 --> 14:14.987
Hey, why don't I sit in your lap

14:14.988 --> 14:17.055
and you can drive me
around? Two birds, one stone?

14:19.926 --> 14:23.128
I wasn't that attracted to you anyway.

14:24.530 --> 14:26.399
I'm gonna go try to find some reception.

14:26.400 --> 14:28.267
Seeing Randy miserable is the only thing

14:28.268 --> 14:29.569
that'll cheer me up right now.

14:29.570 --> 14:31.203
Maybe he's crying.

14:33.039 --> 14:36.743
One vodka for the gentleman
with the neck tattoo,

14:36.744 --> 14:39.112
and two vodkas for the lady

14:39.113 --> 14:40.779
who's into that sort of thing.

14:41.914 --> 14:43.750
Thank you.

14:43.751 --> 14:45.385
Your catfish tower's on its way.

14:45.386 --> 14:47.953
It takes two to carry
the cocktail sauce lagoon.

14:51.391 --> 14:52.859
Everything on double-zero.

14:52.860 --> 14:55.261
Which has to be the
Yelp rating of this boat.

14:55.262 --> 14:56.562
Excuse me?

14:56.563 --> 14:58.497
Could I get a white wine spritzer?

14:59.899 --> 15:03.102
Oh, come on, Vera. We share a locker.

15:03.103 --> 15:04.303
Oh, double-zero.

15:04.304 --> 15:05.371
Winner.

15:05.372 --> 15:07.206
Yes, I'm a winner again!

15:07.207 --> 15:09.041
Suck it, river people.

15:09.042 --> 15:11.043
What is going on over here?

15:11.044 --> 15:13.146
Employees are not allowed to gamble.

15:13.147 --> 15:15.648
Or, as of last week,
sexually harass each other.

15:15.649 --> 15:16.748
Thanks a lot, Craig.

15:17.884 --> 15:19.719
Ugh.

15:19.720 --> 15:21.587
Poindexter in the radio room

15:21.588 --> 15:23.456
wouldn't let me use the satellite phone.

15:23.457 --> 15:25.458
Also, I broke your satellite phone.

15:25.459 --> 15:27.460
That is it. You're fired.

15:27.461 --> 15:29.595
That's the worst news I've heard

15:29.596 --> 15:31.297
since you said "you're hired."

15:31.298 --> 15:34.434
There's a tug coming to
swap out the toilet tanks.

15:34.435 --> 15:36.068
I am putting you two on it.

15:36.069 --> 15:37.670
As captains?

15:37.671 --> 15:40.038
Or should I say, crap-tains?

15:43.142 --> 15:44.609
Hey, everybody!

15:46.779 --> 15:49.147
I got spinning wheels
for Barbara's carriage.

15:50.316 --> 15:52.285
Now's it's not just her attitude

15:52.286 --> 15:53.385
that's gangster.

15:56.355 --> 15:58.958
Uh... can y'all keep it down, please?

15:58.959 --> 16:01.861
I'm trying to set up my
new wireless headphones.

16:01.862 --> 16:04.931
Gonna make my WalkMan sound amazing.

16:04.932 --> 16:06.866
This is ridiculous.

16:06.867 --> 16:08.835
I'm trying to keep
things on the down-low,

16:08.836 --> 16:11.504
and you three went on
the biggest shopping spree

16:11.505 --> 16:14.040
since Ellen at a Men's Wearhouse sale.

16:14.041 --> 16:16.309
Oh, wait a minute.

16:16.310 --> 16:18.044
Wait a minute.

16:18.045 --> 16:22.381
Han, why are you
taller than the counter?

16:22.382 --> 16:26.185
Just been eating right
and getting enough sleep.

16:26.186 --> 16:29.188
Yeah, something's weird.

16:29.189 --> 16:32.057
You're almost the height
of an adult penguin.

16:33.292 --> 16:35.962
Fine! I treated myself to lifts.

16:35.963 --> 16:40.299
I was sick of being nose to
butt with everyone on the subway.

16:40.300 --> 16:42.702
Check out Caroline's Instagram.

16:42.703 --> 16:44.470
Looks like they're in
more trouble than I was

16:44.471 --> 16:46.338
the last time I tried
to put on overalls.

16:47.907 --> 16:50.810
Ooh, they're on a tugboat
filled with toilets,

16:50.811 --> 16:52.912
and she writes, "Help.

16:52.913 --> 16:55.715
Please send money."

16:55.716 --> 16:57.216
So...

16:57.217 --> 16:58.651
quick unfollow?

16:58.652 --> 17:02.255
Or sleep on it and
pow-wow in the morning?

17:02.256 --> 17:04.589
No. We have to help them.

17:04.590 --> 17:07.192
I lost the cord to
these headphones anyway.

17:11.531 --> 17:14.065
Oh, still got toilet boat legs.

17:15.501 --> 17:17.469
Ugh, this place reeks of bait.

17:18.938 --> 17:20.872
Oh, no, wait. That was
me. My mouth was open.

17:21.874 --> 17:23.075
More importantly,

17:23.076 --> 17:24.618
I finally have enough bars on my phone

17:24.619 --> 17:26.178
to stalk Randy on Snapchat.

17:26.179 --> 17:29.215
Oh, great! All of our
problems are solved,

17:29.216 --> 17:31.617
except for food, money,
and a place to sleep.

17:31.618 --> 17:33.719
So negative.

17:33.720 --> 17:36.055
Have you not seen the sneeze-guard-less

17:36.056 --> 17:38.558
bait shop salad bar?

17:38.559 --> 17:40.459
Speaking of pathetic,

17:40.460 --> 17:43.496
let me just check in on poor Randy.

17:43.497 --> 17:45.932
Just another lonely
night here in Texas...

17:45.933 --> 17:47.700
with all my new best friends!

17:47.701 --> 17:49.134
- Hey!
- Ha-ha!

17:51.003 --> 17:52.905
Hey! I was up next for Twister!

17:52.906 --> 17:54.040
Classic Jake.

17:54.041 --> 17:55.575
- Hey!
- Hey!

17:55.576 --> 17:59.612
Ha. I'm sure he's just
putting on a happy face.

17:59.613 --> 18:01.914
That's obviously the
only way to handle Jake.

18:01.915 --> 18:04.984
Deep down, I can tell
he's genuinely upset.

18:04.985 --> 18:07.318
I'm just genuinely happy right now.

18:10.489 --> 18:14.260
Ugh, this salad bar stinks.

18:14.261 --> 18:16.429
No, wait. That's me again.

18:17.664 --> 18:19.565
Oh, my God, Max!

18:19.566 --> 18:22.134
The diner people put money
in our PayPal account!

18:22.135 --> 18:24.003
They say it's from Chestnut,

18:24.004 --> 18:27.340
but he's not allowed on the
Internet when we're not home.

18:27.341 --> 18:28.841
I can't believe it.

18:28.842 --> 18:30.242
Me neither.

18:30.243 --> 18:32.578
The diner people are all
we have in this world.

18:32.579 --> 18:35.448
And I used to have a
closet just for scarves.

18:35.449 --> 18:38.084
No! That Randy's happy without me.

18:38.085 --> 18:39.418
What am I doing?

18:39.419 --> 18:41.087
I'm dragging you all over the country

18:41.088 --> 18:43.789
after some guy who isn't
even interested in me anymore.

18:43.790 --> 18:47.259
This is my worst idea since I
told DeNiro to stick to comedy.

18:47.260 --> 18:48.928
So, what are you saying?

18:48.929 --> 18:50.830
I'm saying this is a mistake.

18:50.831 --> 18:52.525
Let's just go home like you said

18:52.526 --> 18:54.258
after that hyena
knocked you to the ground

18:54.259 --> 18:55.792
and tried to hump you.

18:57.861 --> 19:00.597
Can I get $12 on number four?

19:00.598 --> 19:04.467
And on which aisle can
I find tucking tape?

19:08.706 --> 19:11.875
Okay, I will just have
these Slim Jims and a Ho-Ho.

19:11.876 --> 19:14.343
It's not like I have to
fit into couture today.

19:20.184 --> 19:21.885
- Stop hitting me.
- Stop hitting me!

19:21.886 --> 19:24.688
Girls, stop fighting.

19:24.689 --> 19:27.324
I hate to see women fighting each other.

19:27.325 --> 19:28.659
Well, unless, of course,

19:28.660 --> 19:30.227
it's Hoda and Kathie Lee

19:30.228 --> 19:32.228
over the last glass of chardonnay.

19:33.831 --> 19:35.699
That's RuPaul!

19:35.700 --> 19:37.667
From RuPaul's Drag Race!

19:39.003 --> 19:41.071
We love your show. We used to watch it

19:41.072 --> 19:42.495
through our neighbor Jeff's window.

19:42.496 --> 19:43.540
But then he met Dean,

19:43.541 --> 19:45.309
and now all they do is cook naked.

19:45.310 --> 19:47.378
So we just watch that now.

19:47.379 --> 19:49.213
Oh, you poor babies.

19:49.214 --> 19:51.515
So, why the cat fight?

19:51.516 --> 19:53.851
Did she steal your size 12 stilettos?

19:53.852 --> 19:56.653
'Cause I would cut a bitch for that.

19:56.654 --> 19:58.389
We were actually on our way to Texas

19:58.390 --> 20:00.591
to see if she and her
ex could patch things us.

20:00.592 --> 20:02.226
No, we're not going to Texas.

20:02.227 --> 20:03.427
We're going back home.

20:03.428 --> 20:05.162
Sometimes you got to admit defeat...

20:05.163 --> 20:08.599
and that there is a very live
junebug in this macaroni salad.

20:08.600 --> 20:13.370
Oh, no, honey. I do not
like the sound of defeat.

20:13.371 --> 20:16.407
You want to know where I'd be
if I'd given up on my dreams?

20:16.408 --> 20:18.409
Living right down the road

20:18.410 --> 20:20.911
managing a Dress Barn,

20:20.912 --> 20:24.715
driving 400 miles in a
ball gown to sing karaoke.

20:24.716 --> 20:28.252
I would not be the
supermodel of the world

20:28.253 --> 20:29.920
that I am today,

20:29.921 --> 20:31.388
okay?

20:31.389 --> 20:33.223
Hello.

20:33.224 --> 20:37.227
Hey, listen. I'm driving to
Texas if y'all want a ride.

20:37.228 --> 20:41.465
Well, shall we sashay away?

20:41.466 --> 20:43.734
You know that's copyrighted.

20:43.735 --> 20:46.736
Say it again, and you owe me $12,000.

20:49.373 --> 20:50.707
- Aah!
- Ah! Shotgun!

20:50.708 --> 20:51.875
I'm sitting next to RuPaul!

20:51.876 --> 20:53.243
No. I'm sitting next to RuPaul.

20:58.622 --> 21:06.381
