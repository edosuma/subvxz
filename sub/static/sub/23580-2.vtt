00:01.500 --> 00:03.200
MATILDA: Mum. Jesus!

00:03.867 --> 00:06.100
No, Mum, no!

00:06.133 --> 00:08.367
She cut her throat
right in front of me.

00:08.400 --> 00:11.733
She left this out on her bed,
like she wanted me to find it.

00:11.767 --> 00:14.767
I look at it and I feel like
I don't even know my own mum.

00:14.800 --> 00:16.733
HAL:
Fine, let's go up there, then.

00:20.300 --> 00:22.800
- I'm Nick.
- Matilda.

00:22.833 --> 00:25.267
My mum killed herself.
I think it had something to do

00:25.300 --> 00:28.233
- with your daughter, Carys.

00:28.267 --> 00:30.333
23 years gone
and you lot are still at it.

00:30.367 --> 00:33.433
NICK: It's right here.
My very own mansion.

00:33.467 --> 00:34.867
My mum kept a photo
of this house.

00:34.900 --> 00:38.267
When I was little, I used to
have this dream. It's dark.

00:38.300 --> 00:40.300
I open a door
and I find a child there.

00:46.167 --> 00:48.100
It's me. I'm the girl.

00:49.567 --> 00:50.700
I'm Carys.

00:57.233 --> 00:59.233
JANICE:
That is so out of character!

00:59.267 --> 01:01.133
I understand but that is
what happened.

01:01.167 --> 01:04.167
I cannot believe that. The other
girl is a troublemaker.

01:04.200 --> 01:05.400
Whereas my Matilda...

01:05.433 --> 01:07.600
Who started it
is not really the issue.

01:07.633 --> 01:10.733
The thing for me is making sure
it doesn't happen again.

01:10.767 --> 01:14.500
You see, the fight started after
Matilda gave her presentation.

01:14.533 --> 01:17.300
The family tree project
they've been working on?

01:20.333 --> 01:21.667
I wasn't aware.

01:21.700 --> 01:24.267
Still, I think it might be worth
taking a look

01:24.300 --> 01:26.533
at what Matilda
read out to the class.

01:28.000 --> 01:34.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:38.633 --> 01:41.400
How many times have I told you?
Stop that, please.

01:43.733 --> 01:47.367
Is it true...
that you spat at a girl?

01:48.500 --> 01:50.433
She called me a liar.

01:55.467 --> 01:56.700
Now...

01:56.733 --> 02:01.267
Now do you understand how hard I
work to send you to this place?

02:03.833 --> 02:06.733
What were you thinking,
writing this rubbish?

02:06.767 --> 02:09.500
- It's not rubbish.

02:09.532 --> 02:12.267
"My Dad was a war hero
in the Gulf - he won the VC.

02:13.333 --> 02:15.167
He died fighting terrorists..."

02:15.200 --> 02:17.300
You told me that!

02:17.333 --> 02:20.467
Every single thing I wrote,
you told me.

02:20.500 --> 02:24.567
- Maybe when you were little.
- You never said any different.

02:24.600 --> 02:27.033
Every time I ask about him,
you shut me down.

02:32.333 --> 02:34.767
He was a soldier...wasn't he?

02:38.867 --> 02:40.800
I met him in the club.

02:43.133 --> 02:45.767
That was it.
I never even knew his surname.

02:50.133 --> 02:52.467
HAL: Er...Tilly,
the police are here.

02:54.367 --> 02:56.300
I'll be down in a minute.

02:57.533 --> 02:59.467
Are you sure you want
to do this now?

03:03.667 --> 03:05.600
I said I'll be down in a minute.

03:10.800 --> 03:12.733
Tilly?

04:07.633 --> 04:11.067
NICK: If you need to take any
of those away, I'm fine with it.

04:11.100 --> 04:13.100
PC GRAVES: Why would I do that?

04:13.133 --> 04:15.133
I dunno. Forensics?

04:15.167 --> 04:18.500
I'm afraid you're gonna have to
explain this again, Ms Gray.

04:18.533 --> 04:21.733
- I've already told you twice.
- Maybe I'm just a bit thick.

04:21.767 --> 04:25.400
Carys Howell was kept in this
house, probably this basement...

04:25.433 --> 04:28.333
And you know this because of
what, some bad dreams?

04:28.367 --> 04:30.533
They weren't just dreams.
They were...

04:31.767 --> 04:33.667
I was here.

04:33.700 --> 04:36.100
But you can't say when, or why?

04:36.133 --> 04:39.567
Children sometimes repress
traumatic memories.

04:39.600 --> 04:41.433
Are you a psychologist?

04:41.467 --> 04:44.267
- No.
- Then let her answer.

04:47.100 --> 04:49.100
Please. Carys was here.

04:49.133 --> 04:51.733
All you need to do is search
this place properly.

04:51.767 --> 04:53.700
There's all this stuff!

04:55.067 --> 04:57.067
Carys was here, I know she was.

04:57.100 --> 04:59.767
I hear there was some fuss
at Mr Dean's funeral.

04:59.800 --> 05:03.433
A young couple harassing
Rose Morgan - Carys's mum.

05:03.467 --> 05:05.067
All we did was talk to her.

05:05.100 --> 05:06.700
I heard there was a fight.

05:06.733 --> 05:08.800
No, I got pushed over
by her thug of a husband.

05:08.833 --> 05:11.700
Hey, look, that was just
a misunderstanding, right?

05:11.733 --> 05:13.600
I hope it was.

05:13.633 --> 05:15.833
Because Rose Morgan's
been through hell

05:15.867 --> 05:19.600
and I'm not gonna let you lot
drag her back into it.

05:19.633 --> 05:21.600
Mr Dean, I wonder
if you'll show me out.

05:21.633 --> 05:23.567
No, no! Wait. OK?

05:25.733 --> 05:27.467
There's a passageway down here.

05:27.500 --> 05:29.467
Yeah, like a crawl space.

05:29.500 --> 05:33.167
It must be hidden...
behind the panelling.

05:34.800 --> 05:37.500
All you need to do is look
and you'll find it.

05:37.533 --> 05:39.367
- There must be a hollow spot.

05:39.400 --> 05:41.667
- Tilly...
- Hal, it could be behind here.

05:41.700 --> 05:44.267
- I need to move this.
- Tilly, please, slow down.

05:44.300 --> 05:45.600
Hey, watch it!

05:48.633 --> 05:50.600
HAL: Tilly, come on, sit down.

05:57.767 --> 05:59.200
I'm sorry.

06:01.167 --> 06:03.100
I'll clean it...
I'll clean it up.

06:11.067 --> 06:13.100
Can I ask how long
you've known those two?

06:13.133 --> 06:14.633
Just met 'em.

06:14.667 --> 06:16.433
And you moved them straight in?

06:16.467 --> 06:18.400
I was trying to help.

06:18.433 --> 06:20.433
She's a pretty girl.

06:20.467 --> 06:23.100
Look, if my uncle had
anything to do with this,

06:23.133 --> 06:26.467
kidnapping kids or something,
I won't just take it lightly.

06:26.500 --> 06:28.500
Your uncle was
a well respected man.

06:29.367 --> 06:30.733
Oh, yeah, I forgot,

06:30.767 --> 06:33.600
cos "well respected people"
never do bad things.

06:33.633 --> 06:36.400
Oh, they do. So do pretty girls.

06:39.600 --> 06:42.333
How sure are you?

06:42.367 --> 06:44.367
About what happened
to my uncle?

06:44.400 --> 06:47.133
You should get the preliminary
coroner's report today.

06:47.167 --> 06:50.067
I'll be a lot surer
when I've seen it.

06:50.100 --> 06:52.333
And you're certain
that he fell off the roof?

06:52.367 --> 06:54.367
Windows were locked,
it had to be.

06:54.400 --> 06:56.733
If I hear any different,
I'll let you know.

07:50.867 --> 07:52.067
Hey!

07:58.600 --> 08:00.167
Who's there?

08:11.567 --> 08:12.567
HAL: Hey.

08:13.600 --> 08:15.267
You OK?

08:17.667 --> 08:19.267
You OK?

08:21.100 --> 08:22.800
Am I going crazy?

08:22.833 --> 08:24.467
Of course not.

08:24.500 --> 08:26.433
Would you tell me if I was?

08:28.533 --> 08:29.800
I don't...

08:40.167 --> 08:42.366
WOMAN: Death resulted
from impact injuries,

08:42.400 --> 08:43.799
likely caused by a fall.

08:43.832 --> 08:47.500
Time of death, approximately
8pm, give or take 30 minutes.

08:47.533 --> 08:49.533
No drugs or alcohol detected.

08:49.567 --> 08:51.200
No sign of a struggle?

08:51.233 --> 08:53.267
All injuries are consistent
with a fall.

08:53.300 --> 08:55.233
There are some burns
around his throat.

08:55.267 --> 08:56.367
Burns?

08:56.400 --> 08:58.833
Superficial,
almost certainly unrelated.

08:58.867 --> 09:01.300
In any event,
we'll be calling it suicide.

09:01.333 --> 09:02.733
All right, thanks, Maddy.

09:02.767 --> 09:05.200
I'll get back to you
when I've had a proper read.

09:05.233 --> 09:07.467
- I've got a call out.

09:07.500 --> 09:10.400
- Just up the old Manor Road.

09:10.433 --> 09:13.633
Next door. Royce Evans is
having another panic attack.

09:15.567 --> 09:17.500
Actually,
I might take that one myself.

09:35.067 --> 09:37.500
HAL: Tilly, last night,
you said some things.

09:39.667 --> 09:42.467
You said you were Carys.

09:42.500 --> 09:44.500
But you didn't tell
that constable.

09:47.800 --> 09:49.800
She'd say I'm mad.

09:49.833 --> 09:51.767
You still think it's true,
though?

09:53.567 --> 09:56.033
Even talking about this,
I feel like a traitor.

09:56.067 --> 09:58.167
- It's not about loyalty.

09:59.667 --> 10:01.500
Janice was my mum.

10:01.533 --> 10:04.100
And now I'm gonna say
that what

10:04.133 --> 10:06.633
No. I knew Janice.

10:06.667 --> 10:09.500
The idea that she's
a kidnapper, it's ridiculous.

10:11.067 --> 10:13.300
My dream,
with the little girl...

10:14.800 --> 10:16.300
She's Carys.

10:18.100 --> 10:20.033
I know she is.

10:21.833 --> 10:23.767
And last night, I saw that...

10:25.500 --> 10:27.067
..that she's me too.

10:27.100 --> 10:30.267
- The girl in the dream is me.
- It's not possible.

10:30.300 --> 10:31.767
Isn't it?

10:31.800 --> 10:34.333
There must be someone
who knew you as a baby.

10:34.367 --> 10:36.500
Who?

10:36.533 --> 10:38.533
Mum didn't have any family.

10:38.567 --> 10:41.667
If she had friends in Manchester
she wasn't in touch with them.

10:41.700 --> 10:43.700
What about that neighbour?

10:43.733 --> 10:45.467
- Yeah.

10:45.500 --> 10:48.033
We didn't meet her until
after we moved to London.

10:48.067 --> 10:50.067
I was already five at that time.

10:50.100 --> 10:52.833
Baby photos, then?

10:52.867 --> 10:55.700
Mum said one of our bags got
lost when we were moving

10:55.733 --> 10:57.667
and all of our photos
were in it.

10:59.333 --> 11:01.333
That sounds like rubbish,
doesn't it?

11:01.367 --> 11:03.767
Like the kind of made-up
story you'd just tell a child.

11:03.800 --> 11:04.900
No, it's...

11:04.933 --> 11:07.367
Hal, I've racked my brains
and I can't remember

11:07.400 --> 11:10.500
a single thing from before
I was five except this house.

11:10.533 --> 11:12.500
I remember this house.

11:12.533 --> 11:14.133
How can that be?

11:14.167 --> 11:15.800
We'll find out.

11:15.833 --> 11:17.833
That's why we're here, right?

11:17.867 --> 11:19.800
To find out.

11:27.800 --> 11:30.333
They always take a lamb or two.
You have to accept it.

11:30.367 --> 11:32.433
So how do you know
this wasn't foxes?

11:32.467 --> 11:34.400
Sheep are stupid, not helpless.

11:35.400 --> 11:37.400
Dog, maybe?

11:37.433 --> 11:41.367
Too much rain last night
to make sense of the tracks.

11:41.400 --> 11:43.367
I'd say wolf, if we had 'em.

11:43.400 --> 11:46.667
Even if there is a wild dog up
here, it's not a police matter.

11:46.700 --> 11:50.033
You better have a look at this
one before you say anything.

11:53.300 --> 11:55.233
That was cut off with a knife.

11:56.600 --> 11:58.133
So you tell me...

11:58.167 --> 12:00.667
if she was killed by an animal,
who took the leg?

12:03.367 --> 12:06.500
If this happened last night, how
come you didn't find 'em sooner?

12:06.533 --> 12:08.200
I would have walked
straight past.

12:08.233 --> 12:10.267
There was no moon
with all the cloud.

12:12.433 --> 12:14.767
Last Monday -
cloudy then, too, was it?

12:14.800 --> 12:16.833
Yeah, all week.

12:16.867 --> 12:19.167
What's this got to do
with my bloody sheep?

12:44.567 --> 12:46.500
Excuse me. Hi.

12:49.767 --> 12:52.300
What can I do for you?

12:52.333 --> 12:55.767
Erm...I will have
a half pint of...

12:59.167 --> 13:00.567
..something local?

13:02.433 --> 13:05.333
No, I'm fine, thank you.

13:05.367 --> 13:08.433
I don't know if you remember us,
but we were in here yesterday

13:08.467 --> 13:10.433
- asking about Rose...
- Rose Morgan, yeah.

13:11.867 --> 13:16.133
And I was wondering
about her ex, Sean.

13:18.133 --> 13:20.067
He a friend of your mum's too,
was he?

13:21.133 --> 13:23.800
No, not exactly.

13:23.833 --> 13:27.167
But I was hoping to talk to him
about something, so...

13:27.200 --> 13:28.767
That'll be Â£1.80.

13:32.200 --> 13:33.700
Right.

13:43.100 --> 13:45.033
WOMAN: Small town.

13:46.867 --> 13:50.233
Events at Ewan's funeral earned
you a degree of notoriety.

13:52.333 --> 13:54.767
I'm Sylvia Walsh.

13:54.800 --> 13:57.067
I run the local antique
dealership.

13:57.733 --> 13:59.433
I'm Matilda.

13:59.467 --> 14:02.567
Matilda Gray and Harlan Fine.

14:02.600 --> 14:03.733
Right.

14:03.767 --> 14:09.200
Your recording of
Saint-SaÃ«ns' A Minor Concerto

14:09.233 --> 14:11.267
is the finest I've heard.

14:12.667 --> 14:14.467
Thank you.

14:14.500 --> 14:19.200
You won't find Sean Howell here,
not in Penllynith.

14:20.167 --> 14:22.167
He's moved on, then?

14:22.200 --> 14:25.033
Disappeared.

14:25.067 --> 14:29.300
About six months
after his poor daughter.

14:29.333 --> 14:33.400
People say he had a breakdown,
because of what happened.

14:33.433 --> 14:35.700
But who knows?

14:37.600 --> 14:39.700
It's a funny place, Penllynith.

14:40.700 --> 14:45.067
Powerful place, but odd too.

14:45.100 --> 14:47.100
You're staying
up at the big house?

14:47.133 --> 14:49.067
HAL: News travels fast
round here.

14:50.433 --> 14:52.233
You won't find Sean.

14:52.267 --> 14:59.133
But I can give you...
Rose's home address...

15:00.533 --> 15:02.533
..on one condition.

15:02.567 --> 15:08.733
You'll pass my card
on to your Australian host?

15:08.767 --> 15:12.367
His new house
is packed with treasures.

15:12.400 --> 15:15.167
If he ever considers
selling them,

15:15.200 --> 15:17.200
well, I'm his girl.

15:17.233 --> 15:20.100
I will do that. Thank you.

15:20.133 --> 15:22.233
Good to meet you, Matilda.

15:25.467 --> 15:27.533
I hope you enjoy being
back in Penllynith.

15:28.800 --> 15:30.467
Back?

15:31.767 --> 15:33.567
Oh.

15:33.600 --> 15:36.200
I assumed you'd visited before.

15:36.233 --> 15:37.633
No.

15:38.567 --> 15:40.333
My mistake.

15:58.533 --> 16:01.133
ROSE: They're wherever
you left them, Davey.

16:03.367 --> 16:05.567
Rose, I'm so sorry
to bother you again...

16:05.600 --> 16:07.200
How did you find my house?

16:07.233 --> 16:09.567
Please, I've got something
I think you'll want to see.

16:09.600 --> 16:12.800
Rose, please just give me ten
minutes, and then I'll go away.

16:12.833 --> 16:15.100
I won't bother you ever again,
I swear.

16:24.533 --> 16:27.300
Where did you get these?

16:27.333 --> 16:31.700
My mum had them, put away
in a box full of clippings.

16:31.733 --> 16:33.667
Most of them related to Carys.

16:36.167 --> 16:38.100
Can I ask you who that man is?

16:39.533 --> 16:41.300
- I don't know.
- But...

16:41.333 --> 16:43.133
But, no, but that's you.

16:43.167 --> 16:45.600
23 years ago,
I had a chat to some bloke

16:45.633 --> 16:48.400
and you expect me to remember
who I was talking to?

16:52.267 --> 16:54.200
My mum.

16:56.433 --> 16:58.100
You don't recognise her?

16:59.133 --> 17:00.433
No.

17:03.833 --> 17:06.133
I'm trying to understand
why she came here

17:06.166 --> 17:08.099
and why she took these pictures.

17:09.700 --> 17:12.700
After it happened,
this place was a circus.

17:12.733 --> 17:15.800
Every day, I had people
like your mum, vultures,

17:15.833 --> 17:18.267
taking pictures, following me
everywhere I went.

17:18.300 --> 17:19.567
My mum's not like that.

17:19.599 --> 17:23.099
She took my photo, without my
permission. How's she different?

17:24.867 --> 17:26.500
What about me?

17:30.067 --> 17:31.733
Do you know me?

17:34.100 --> 17:36.833
- Mum, I've got to get going.
- Davey, go back downstairs.

17:36.867 --> 17:38.467
- I get in trouble if I'm late.
- Davey,

17:38.500 --> 17:40.467
I need a moment, please!

17:42.367 --> 17:43.733
You've got kids?

17:43.767 --> 17:45.000
- One child.
- Rose...

17:45.033 --> 17:48.567
You said if I talked to you,
you'd go away. I've talked.

17:49.533 --> 17:51.467
I wrote my number down...

17:52.867 --> 17:54.800
..in case you remember anything.

17:57.867 --> 17:59.833
- No, I want those.
- No, these are my mum's.

17:59.867 --> 18:01.500
They're photos of me.

18:01.533 --> 18:03.467
That's fair enough, isn't it?

18:56.133 --> 18:58.500
Please, Mum,
I'll get in trouble if I'm late.

18:59.800 --> 19:01.800
Well, we don't want that.

19:01.833 --> 19:03.767
Best get going,
hadn't we?

19:06.233 --> 19:10.700
Some sort of grudge, maybe,
against the Dean family?

19:10.733 --> 19:13.300
If I had to guess,
I'd say she really believed it.

19:13.333 --> 19:15.400
Bonkers, then. That's bad.

19:15.433 --> 19:17.300
Lot harder to move her on.

19:17.333 --> 19:20.300
Back in the day, did anybody
look at the big house?

19:20.333 --> 19:23.100
For God's sake, we looked
at everything. Twice.

19:23.133 --> 19:26.600
Then took another bloody look
just for good measure.

19:26.633 --> 19:28.367
You don't credit this girl,
do you?

19:28.400 --> 19:29.800
Nah.

19:29.833 --> 19:32.467
It's just if she goes round
telling people Ewan Dean...

19:32.500 --> 19:34.433
Orange juice for them
that have to work,

19:34.467 --> 19:36.533
pint of bitter
for those that don't.

19:36.567 --> 19:39.600
Tell your dad, he's still doing
the best roast lamb in Wales.

19:39.633 --> 19:41.233
Only in Wales?

19:42.633 --> 19:45.600
So, do I warn the Morgans?

19:45.633 --> 19:48.567
Rose is fragile. You don't want
to hurt her for no reason.

19:48.600 --> 19:50.600
Yeah, exactly.

19:50.633 --> 19:52.567
But if I don't...

19:55.400 --> 19:57.000
You took the girl's details?

20:05.100 --> 20:07.233
I'll have a look.

20:07.267 --> 20:10.033
Us retirees...
we need to keep busy.

20:10.067 --> 20:11.800
- No.

20:11.833 --> 20:13.467
- Please.
- Order some lunch.

20:13.500 --> 20:16.233
- I can't, I'm on duty.
- Break the law.

20:16.267 --> 20:18.700
Hi, Kath, it's Matilda,
Janice's daughter.

20:18.733 --> 20:20.333
Tilly!

20:20.367 --> 20:23.033
How are you coping, love?

20:23.067 --> 20:26.300
All right, you know. Holding up.

20:26.333 --> 20:29.433
I'm out of town and I need
a copy of my birth certificate

20:29.467 --> 20:32.800
for a job in the US.

20:32.833 --> 20:36.433
I'm sure your mum would've had
a copy put away somewhere.

20:44.300 --> 20:46.300
Tilly, are you still there?

20:46.333 --> 20:48.667
Yeah, no, no, I know,
but I forgot to dig it out

20:48.700 --> 20:51.667
and I'm away at the moment so...

20:51.700 --> 20:55.567
I was wondering if you might go
round to Mum's and have a look.

20:55.600 --> 20:58.333
- I know that's a big ask.

20:58.367 --> 21:00.367
No, no, I've got a spare key.

21:00.400 --> 21:03.367
I can go round
there tomorrow after work.

21:03.400 --> 21:06.067
Kath, that is wonderful.
You're a life saver.

21:06.100 --> 21:08.367
- Thank you.
- OK, Tilly, take care, love.

21:08.400 --> 21:10.400
Yeah, I will. You too, bye.

21:16.600 --> 21:18.600
- She'll do it.
- Good old Kath.

21:18.633 --> 21:20.500
Er...the park?

21:20.533 --> 21:24.433
Apparently it's just down there,
about a five-minute walk.

21:24.467 --> 21:26.567
But, you know,
we don't have to go if...

21:42.233 --> 21:44.167
That'll be where
she was last seen.

21:46.800 --> 21:48.500
Can you imagine?

21:48.533 --> 21:50.833
You turn around and suddenly
your child's gone.

21:50.867 --> 21:53.133
She wasn't with her mum
when it happened.

21:53.167 --> 21:55.100
She was with a family friend.

22:01.567 --> 22:03.567
Rose lied to me.

22:03.600 --> 22:05.533
About what?

22:06.433 --> 22:08.633
The photos.

22:08.667 --> 22:13.067
She said she didn't know who the
man was but I could see she did.

22:13.100 --> 22:17.233
It's been 23 years.
Maybe she just wants to move on.

22:17.267 --> 22:19.200
Her child was taken from her.

22:21.200 --> 22:23.133
How could anyone
move on from that?

22:46.333 --> 22:48.333
I'll see you back at the house,
OK?

22:48.367 --> 22:50.667
What

22:52.100 --> 22:53.433
Just don't look so worried.

22:53.467 --> 22:56.000
I'm just gonna go for a walk
just to think, OK?

25:15.433 --> 25:18.367
That going on the tab, is it?

25:18.400 --> 25:20.433
You still keeping a tab on me,
are you?

25:26.500 --> 25:29.167
Evening, Tru.
Half of bitter, please.

25:29.200 --> 25:31.133
All right, Eddie boy.

25:33.367 --> 25:35.167
Oh, I um...

25:35.200 --> 25:38.000
I got the pathologist's report
on Ewan Dean.

25:39.167 --> 25:41.233
- Yeah.

25:41.267 --> 25:43.733
Still a bit fuzzy on
the time of death, though.

25:43.767 --> 25:47.200
Be good if we could pin down
exactly what time you found him.

25:47.233 --> 25:49.133
TRUDY: He phoned you, didn't he?

25:49.167 --> 25:51.633
Reported it. So you must know
what time he called?

25:53.300 --> 25:54.567
MAN: Excuse me, love?

25:55.600 --> 25:58.267
Go on, Tru, customers first.

26:05.633 --> 26:08.633
She's right.
You called in at 9:01pm.

26:08.667 --> 26:10.767
But I'm asking
what time you got there.

26:12.467 --> 26:14.400
Here's what you told me.

26:20.833 --> 26:23.800
"I pulled up, got out my car,
about to unload the tray,

26:23.833 --> 26:27.033
then turned, saw Mr Dean's body
at the bottom of the house.

26:27.067 --> 26:30.467
I checked him out, he wasn't
breathing. I called the police."

26:30.500 --> 26:32.433
That's what happened.

26:34.233 --> 26:36.233
Last Monday,
the sun set at 7:38pm.

26:36.267 --> 26:39.367
You couldn't have seen the nose
on your face by 9 o'clock,

26:39.400 --> 26:42.300
much less a body, 30 metres
from where you parked.

26:43.633 --> 26:45.233
Why don't you come in tomorrow?

26:45.267 --> 26:47.500
We'll have another chat
about the whole thing,

26:47.533 --> 26:49.633
see if we can
get those times straight.

26:57.400 --> 26:58.800
DAVID: Wow.

26:58.833 --> 27:02.033
Thanks, Dad.

27:02.067 --> 27:04.467
First game for the club,
you deserve it, my boy.

27:04.500 --> 27:06.500
Just wish I wasn't
bloody working.

27:06.533 --> 27:09.267
- Those look expensive.

27:09.300 --> 27:13.033
I'm not having my son play
his first game in old trainers.

27:16.600 --> 27:18.233
KENDRICK: Morgans?

27:18.267 --> 27:19.600
Mr and Mrs Morgan?

27:19.633 --> 27:21.367
Rosie, how are you?

27:21.400 --> 27:23.600
- Stephen, come in.
- No, I can't stop, but...

27:24.467 --> 27:26.633
is Aron home?

27:26.667 --> 27:29.600
- No, no.

27:29.633 --> 27:31.533
Good timing,
we've just served dinner.

27:31.567 --> 27:34.267
I'm sorry to interrupt you but
can I have a quick word?

27:34.300 --> 27:35.600
Secret men's business.

27:36.833 --> 27:38.700
I'll see you later, then,
Stephen.

27:38.733 --> 27:40.567
See you, Rosie.

29:04.500 --> 29:07.233
RENATA: Darling, I know your
head's not on work right now.

29:07.267 --> 29:08.333
No, it's not.

29:08.367 --> 29:10.767
We really need to reassure
the Americans.

29:10.800 --> 29:14.567
I spoke to Benedict yesterday,
and he fears they'll cancel.

29:14.600 --> 29:16.200
OK, but...

29:18.467 --> 29:20.767
OK, but, Renata,
can't you handle that?

29:20.800 --> 29:22.667
Up to a point, but, darling,

29:22.700 --> 29:25.533
you're supposed to be arriving
in New York in three weeks.

29:25.567 --> 29:27.467
So we need to get things
moving.

29:27.500 --> 29:30.400
Yep. Erm...fine.

29:30.433 --> 29:32.133
Can I call you tomorrow morning?

29:32.167 --> 29:33.800
I'm available any time
on my mobile.

29:33.833 --> 29:35.767
Fine. I'll call you tomorrow.

29:47.833 --> 29:49.833
How long's it been?

29:49.867 --> 29:51.800
You know
you'll lose your touch.

30:24.500 --> 30:26.033
Hey!

30:27.100 --> 30:29.033
I'm in here.

30:30.567 --> 30:32.500
Hal, what are you doing?

30:42.367 --> 30:43.767
Nick?

30:45.600 --> 30:47.533
Nick, this isn't funny.

32:08.167 --> 32:11.133
Look, look, it's complicated.

32:11.167 --> 32:13.233
Jacqui, I was not bullshitting
you, OK?

32:13.267 --> 32:14.700
I'm going to get the money.

32:14.733 --> 32:17.567
No, I know, I'm just...
I'm doing my best.

32:23.600 --> 32:25.533
MATILDA: Hal!

32:26.300 --> 32:27.533
Hal!

32:28.833 --> 32:30.767
Hal, where are you?

32:33.567 --> 32:35.833
- There's something in there.

32:35.867 --> 32:36.867
What?

32:36.900 --> 32:39.300
NICK: The power's out.
Are you guys all right?

32:39.333 --> 32:41.000
Listen.

32:44.200 --> 32:46.133
- Bloody hell.

32:56.633 --> 32:58.533
Do you have a key?

32:58.567 --> 33:00.733
No. I didn't think the bedrooms
even had locks.

33:00.767 --> 33:02.100
This one does.

33:05.600 --> 33:08.133
The blue door's at the end of
the corridor, right?

33:08.167 --> 33:10.100
Yeah. All of the windows
are closed so...

33:10.133 --> 33:12.500
One, two, three, four.
There's five rooms on that side.

33:12.533 --> 33:14.133
There's only four windows.

33:14.167 --> 33:16.567
That's not right.

33:16.600 --> 33:18.500
The last window
has been bricked up.

33:25.500 --> 33:27.500
Hey, you!

33:27.533 --> 33:29.233
HAL: Hey!

33:29.267 --> 33:31.167
Tilly, wait!

33:37.800 --> 33:39.600
HAL: Tilly!

33:42.633 --> 33:44.300
Oh, shit!

33:56.600 --> 33:59.500
What are you doing?

33:59.533 --> 34:02.300
- I was chasing him.

34:02.333 --> 34:04.567
He's gone now
but you must have seen him.

34:04.600 --> 34:07.533
All I saw was myself,
tripping over that bloody rock.

34:12.733 --> 34:14.667
It's not a rock.

34:16.733 --> 34:19.199
I've just seen that...
that symbol.

35:01.333 --> 35:03.267
Did you lock up?

35:06.733 --> 35:08.367
Rosie?

35:10.767 --> 35:12.767
What did Stephen want?

35:12.800 --> 35:15.733
Oh, nothing,
just passing on a message.

35:17.233 --> 35:18.700
Tell me.

35:22.433 --> 35:24.367
That woman at the funeral.

35:25.500 --> 35:27.500
She's still in town,

35:27.533 --> 35:30.200
still talking about Carys.

35:30.233 --> 35:33.167
What's she saying?

35:33.200 --> 35:35.300
- It's silly.
- Tell me.

35:40.467 --> 35:43.333
She reckons
that Ewan Dean was involved.

35:43.367 --> 35:45.100
But why does she say that?

35:45.133 --> 35:47.233
- Because she's mad.

35:50.300 --> 35:53.633
She reckons that she remembers
stuff from when she was a kid.

35:53.667 --> 35:55.533
Stuff at the big house.

35:57.333 --> 35:59.267
It's all rubbish, isn't it?

36:00.633 --> 36:03.400
She...was here too.

36:04.433 --> 36:05.767
What?

36:05.800 --> 36:07.733
She came here, today.

36:10.067 --> 36:12.567
- You didn't tell me.
- I'm telling you now.

36:12.600 --> 36:14.600
Well, what did she want?

36:14.633 --> 36:16.233
Nothing.

36:17.333 --> 36:19.267
Like you said, it's all rubbish.

37:13.600 --> 37:16.300
Tricky bastard. Lock's rusted.

37:16.333 --> 37:20.033
MATILDA: You're a locksmith!
There must be a way to open it.

37:20.067 --> 37:22.000
HAL: Tilly, he's doing his best.

37:27.333 --> 37:28.833
There we go, madam.

37:28.867 --> 37:30.800
Maybe I should go in first?

37:36.300 --> 37:38.367
NICK:
Jesus, it's freezing in here.

37:38.400 --> 37:40.800
Creepy.

37:40.833 --> 37:42.400
HAL: Of course it's creepy.

37:42.433 --> 37:44.533
It's a windowless room
in an old house.

38:34.500 --> 38:37.167
- There's your moaning sound.

38:37.200 --> 38:38.667
The fireplace is blocked up

38:38.700 --> 38:41.200
but the chimney would be
like a wind tunnel.

38:42.467 --> 38:44.467
NICK: Yeah, and the knocking?

38:44.500 --> 38:46.600
HAL: Well, if the draught
was strong enough,

38:46.633 --> 38:49.467
maybe it would make this swing
which could knock something.

38:49.500 --> 38:53.067
NICK: A strong draught
and a blocked fireplace?

38:53.100 --> 38:56.267
HAL: Maybe there was a bird
in the chimney, or an animal...

38:57.367 --> 38:59.333
I can't stand it in here.

39:20.067 --> 39:22.000
Someone's watching me.

39:23.333 --> 39:25.367
They have been
ever since we got here.

39:29.800 --> 39:31.733
Tilly, this is getting crazy.

39:35.400 --> 39:36.767
I guess I asked for that:

39:36.800 --> 39:38.600
told you to tell me
if I'm acting mad.

39:38.633 --> 39:40.633
I'm not saying you're mad.

39:40.667 --> 39:42.233
But?

39:42.267 --> 39:43.800
If something suspicious
is going on,

39:43.833 --> 39:46.400
we should head back to London,
talk to that detective.

39:46.433 --> 39:49.367
Why would she believe me
when no one else does?

39:49.400 --> 39:51.367
Fine.

39:51.400 --> 39:53.367
Fine.
But even if we don't go back,

39:53.400 --> 39:55.267
let's at least get away
from this house.

39:55.300 --> 39:58.167
You're not listening! I tell
you, there's something here!

39:58.200 --> 39:59.767
OK.

39:59.800 --> 40:01.233
OK.

40:08.833 --> 40:10.300
No.

40:13.200 --> 40:14.833
Look,
I'm obviously annoying you.

40:14.867 --> 40:17.300
Maybe it's best
if I stay in that pub tonight,

40:17.333 --> 40:18.667
give you some space.

40:18.700 --> 40:20.633
Whatever you like.

40:25.100 --> 40:27.033
I'll see you tomorrow, then.

40:40.067 --> 40:42.267
ARON:
Come on, get a move on.

40:44.400 --> 40:46.000
Come on, Davey.

40:50.500 --> 40:52.300
Can you get your bag together?

40:52.333 --> 40:54.367
- I can't find my hoodie, Dad.
- On the chair.

40:54.400 --> 40:56.767
- You turned off my alarm.
- I thought you deserved a rest.

40:56.800 --> 41:00.033
- I got to get the school lunch.
- It's done, it's all done.

41:00.067 --> 41:02.300
I'm taking him to school.
Come on. In your bag.

41:02.333 --> 41:05.767
You just relax,
leave everything to me, OK?

41:05.800 --> 41:07.800
- Come on, let's go!
- I'm coming!

41:07.833 --> 41:11.267
No time! Gotta go, gotta go!
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

42:11.800 --> 42:14.667
- Please. I know you're there.

42:43.333 --> 42:45.333
NICK:
Well, I looked at the fuse box

42:45.367 --> 42:48.600
and everything
seemed to be fine.

42:48.633 --> 42:52.233
An electrician's coming tomorrow
so maybe he'll figure it out.

42:54.567 --> 42:58.033
So, I was thinking
that we should...

42:58.067 --> 43:01.067
We should have a talk
about the will some time.

43:02.767 --> 43:04.567
Now's fine.

43:04.600 --> 43:07.767
Well, maybe the best way that
we could manage this trust thing

43:07.800 --> 43:11.200
is if we were to...
work together.

43:11.233 --> 43:15.800
I live in Australia, and having
all this property in Wales...

43:15.833 --> 43:19.600
I was thinking perhaps that
we should sell off some land,

43:19.633 --> 43:21.467
and free up some cash.

43:21.500 --> 43:23.367
CARL:
We won't be selling anything.

43:23.400 --> 43:26.600
It wouldn't affect you. It'd
just be a couple of paddocks.

43:26.633 --> 43:27.600
CARL: Nothing.

43:27.633 --> 43:30.033
So how do I get any money
out of this setup?

43:30.067 --> 43:31.600
You don't.

43:31.633 --> 43:33.400
But I'm the beneficiary.

43:33.433 --> 43:35.367
And I'm the trustee...

43:36.633 --> 43:38.633
..which means
I make the decisions.

43:42.600 --> 43:44.800
Sorry, am I interrupting?

43:44.833 --> 43:47.600
Meredith, this is Matilda.

43:47.633 --> 43:50.300
Matilda, this is my
Great Aunt Meredith

43:50.333 --> 43:52.833
who lives over
at the old huntsman's lodge.

43:52.867 --> 43:54.800
On my property.

43:56.633 --> 43:58.567
We're just leaving.

44:03.367 --> 44:05.300
The girl can walk with us.

44:23.800 --> 44:25.667
She says,
what do you want to ask her?

44:26.700 --> 44:28.267
How do you mean?

44:30.267 --> 44:33.600
You have questions for me.
So ask them.

44:33.633 --> 44:35.433
Why did you want me
to walk with you?

44:37.433 --> 44:39.400
Waste of a question. Ask again.

44:41.733 --> 44:44.500
Were you living here
when Carys Howell was taken?

44:46.167 --> 44:47.767
Who took her?

44:50.467 --> 44:52.500
Everyone in town
thought it was her father.

44:52.533 --> 44:54.467
But not you.

44:57.367 --> 45:00.067
Do you know a Janice Gray?

45:01.167 --> 45:03.633
Never heard of her.

45:03.667 --> 45:07.200
What about Ewan Dean? Was
he involved in the kidnapping?

45:10.300 --> 45:12.300
My brother was not a bad man,

45:12.333 --> 45:14.267
he was just easily led.

45:15.533 --> 45:17.333
That's not an answer.

45:18.233 --> 45:20.100
My turn to ask.

45:20.133 --> 45:21.733
Why are you here?

45:23.100 --> 45:25.033
I want to know who I am.

45:28.100 --> 45:30.033
Go home, you silly girl...

45:32.300 --> 45:34.333
..before you make
even more trouble.

45:46.600 --> 45:48.600
I'm not a girl.

45:48.633 --> 45:52.200
- And you can't just go now.
- Yes, she can.

45:52.233 --> 45:54.400
I'm sorry,
but Meredith is very tired.

45:54.433 --> 45:56.367
It's time she had a lie down.

47:13.100 --> 47:14.567
Hi.

47:17.733 --> 47:19.667
My name's Tilly.

47:21.567 --> 47:23.400
I'm Davey.

47:27.233 --> 47:29.300
I need to talk to your mum
again, Davey.

47:29.333 --> 47:31.267
Is she picking you up today?

47:35.800 --> 47:39.067
Did she say anything to you
about why I came by yesterday?

47:53.600 --> 47:55.600
I told you not to talk
to strangers.

47:55.633 --> 47:57.567
- Aron. Aron, wait...

47:57.600 --> 48:00.433
I don't mean any harm. I just
wanted to talk to your wife.

48:00.467 --> 48:02.533
- We're going home.
- Dad, please!

48:02.567 --> 48:05.467
It's not his fault, he hasn't
done anything wrong!

48:05.500 --> 48:08.067
- You're hurting him!
- Get away from my son!

48:08.100 --> 48:10.700
- She's harassing my boy.

48:10.733 --> 48:12.733
I'm not harassing his boy.

48:12.767 --> 48:15.100
- Stalking him.
- I'm not stalking him!

48:15.133 --> 48:16.767
Are you a parent?

48:16.800 --> 48:19.333
Are you a relative of
one of the children here?

48:19.367 --> 48:21.133
Are you?

48:26.700 --> 48:29.033
I'm his sister.

48:29.067 --> 48:32.100
I'm his fucking sister, OK?

48:46.167 --> 48:48.667
NICK: You're saying she doesn't
have to give me a cent?

48:48.700 --> 48:51.700
LLOYD: You can challenge her
decision and probably win,

48:51.733 --> 48:53.500
but it would require
a court action.

48:53.533 --> 48:56.133
I'm in the process
of winding up my practice,

48:56.167 --> 48:59.400
so you probably need to start
looking for a new lawyer soon.

48:59.433 --> 49:01.433
The whole region's
been feeling the pinch,

49:01.467 --> 49:02.833
I'm afraid, so...

49:02.867 --> 49:05.700
What about all the stuff here?

49:05.733 --> 49:08.633
You know, antiques and old
books. Can we sell them?

49:08.667 --> 49:13.200
Strictly speaking, the contents
of the house are also in trust.

49:13.233 --> 49:17.500
But...keeping an eye on it all
is next to impossible...

49:21.533 --> 49:24.400
Lloyd, I'm gonna have to give
you a call back in a bit.

49:27.700 --> 49:30.533
Wait, wait.

49:30.567 --> 49:33.133
I'm very into this
but...are you sure?

49:55.767 --> 49:57.433
How's Davey?

49:58.400 --> 50:00.333
In his room.

50:02.633 --> 50:06.100
That English bitch
was at the school.

50:06.133 --> 50:08.067
She told him
that she's his sister.

50:10.500 --> 50:12.200
- You heard me.

50:13.800 --> 50:17.333
I felt it, the minute I saw her.

50:18.533 --> 50:19.700
What?

50:19.733 --> 50:22.033
- No, no.

50:22.067 --> 50:25.067
I mean, I knew she was going
to say something like that.

50:27.167 --> 50:29.633
Then why did you let her
into our house?

50:29.667 --> 50:31.600
You shouldn't have done it,
Rosie.

50:33.500 --> 50:36.167
- You got her started.
- I didn't, I told her to go.

50:36.200 --> 50:38.567
Now she's pushing,
and she's gonna keep pushing.

50:38.600 --> 50:40.700
It'll be our boy who'll suffer,
our son.

50:40.733 --> 50:43.367
No! You've got no idea!

50:43.400 --> 50:45.033
Keep it down!

50:45.067 --> 50:47.367
It was my girl they took!
Mine, not yours!

50:47.400 --> 50:51.033
Yes, and she's dead!
My boy is alive!

50:51.067 --> 50:53.533
I hate you!

50:53.567 --> 50:55.300
Last time you
did something like this!

50:55.333 --> 50:57.733
I won't let you do that again.
Do you understand me?

50:57.767 --> 50:59.767
I won't let you break up
this family!

51:03.233 --> 51:05.167
Break my arm if you want.

51:06.200 --> 51:08.133
You think I care?

51:12.267 --> 51:14.033
I'm sorry.

51:21.067 --> 51:22.667
You good?

51:23.867 --> 51:25.700
I'm hungry.

51:25.733 --> 51:28.367
First time in, like, forever.

51:28.400 --> 51:33.300
Well, you have not lived until
you've had my avocado fusilli.

51:33.333 --> 51:34.567
Oh, my God.

51:34.600 --> 51:37.100
You're a massive wanker,
did you know that?

51:38.500 --> 51:41.700
Yeah. Always.

51:41.733 --> 51:45.233
Better hop before it gets too
dark to cook down there, though.

51:48.467 --> 51:50.400
Smashing avos is a fine art.

54:46.233 --> 54:47.667
Hello?

54:50.267 --> 54:52.200
I know you're there.

56:02.800 --> 56:04.067
Hello?

56:14.767 --> 56:16.533
Where did you get this?

56:21.700 --> 56:23.233
I bought it.

56:24.267 --> 56:26.200
Half for you, half for me.

56:39.733 --> 56:41.600
Do you know me?

56:41.633 --> 56:43.333
Sean?

56:43.367 --> 56:45.300
Don't be scared.

56:45.333 --> 56:48.800
It's OK. Please don't go.

56:48.833 --> 56:50.767
- I smell bad.
- I don't care.

56:51.800 --> 56:53.733
I just want to see you.

57:00.567 --> 57:02.333
NICK: Matilda?

57:02.367 --> 57:05.233
Sean! Wait, it's OK.
It's OK, he's my friend.

57:05.267 --> 57:07.233
NICK: Where are you?
- Careful.

57:07.267 --> 57:10.333
Thin Ones are near.

57:10.367 --> 57:13.267
They're hurting, and when
they're hurting, they're wild.

57:13.300 --> 57:15.033
Wait!

57:15.067 --> 57:16.400
NICK: Matilda?

57:17.400 --> 57:19.333
Wait! Come back! Sean!

57:58.367 --> 58:01.133
CARYS:
Please can I go home now?

58:01.167 --> 58:03.533
EWAN: You don't want to go yet,
do you, Carys?

58:06.067 --> 58:08.433
We're going to have
so much fun. You don't...
