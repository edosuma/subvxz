00:12.045 --> 00:13.685
[Alec] Okay, I've made

00:12.045 --> 00:13.685
yours spicy, yeah?

00:14.765 --> 00:16.685
<i>Bhaji?</i>

00:14.765 --> 00:16.685
No worries, thank you.

00:16.725 --> 00:19.645
[Fred]<i> Many of us dream</i>

00:16.725 --> 00:19.645
<i>of owning our own restaurant.</i>

00:19.685 --> 00:22.245
Duck wrap? Yep.

00:19.685 --> 00:22.245
Hot one? Yep.

00:22.285 --> 00:25.405
[Fred]<i> But some people</i>

00:22.285 --> 00:25.405
<i>are determined</i>

00:22.285 --> 00:25.405
<i>to make it a reality.</i>

00:25.445 --> 00:26.485
Thank you.

00:26.525 --> 00:28.885
There's nothing

00:26.525 --> 00:28.885
like this out there.

00:28.925 --> 00:31.445
We left our jobs

00:28.925 --> 00:31.445
to follow our dream.

00:31.485 --> 00:33.725
I want to be

00:31.485 --> 00:33.725
the Nando's of duck.

00:33.765 --> 00:35.045
[Fred]<i> It's such</i>

00:33.765 --> 00:35.045
<i>a tough business</i>

00:36.405 --> 00:39.965
<i>but if you get it right,</i>

00:36.405 --> 00:39.965
<i>it could change your life.</i>

00:40.005 --> 00:43.805
<i>I'm Fred Sirieix.</i>

00:40.005 --> 00:43.805
<i>I've worked in the hospitality</i>

00:40.005 --> 00:43.805
<i>industry for 30 years.</i>

00:43.845 --> 00:45.405
Over the next six weeks,

00:45.445 --> 00:48.725
I'll be looking

00:45.445 --> 00:48.725
for the new generation

00:45.445 --> 00:48.725
of restaurant ideas.

00:51.045 --> 00:54.325
Here in Manchester,

00:51.045 --> 00:54.325
the food capital of the north,

00:54.365 --> 00:57.445
some of the UK's most

00:54.365 --> 00:57.445
exciting food entrepreneurs

00:57.485 --> 01:03.325
<i>will get a trial run</i>

00:57.485 --> 01:03.325
<i>in front of the country's</i>

00:57.485 --> 01:03.325
<i>most respected investors.</i>

01:03.365 --> 01:08.845
<i>These men and women</i>

01:03.365 --> 01:08.845
<i>can turn the right ideas into</i>

01:03.365 --> 01:08.845
<i>Britain's best restaurants.</i>

01:08.885 --> 01:11.525
I like businesses where

01:08.885 --> 01:11.525
I see that's almost great...

01:11.565 --> 01:13.205
[Lacey]

01:11.565 --> 01:13.205
First order of the day.

01:13.245 --> 01:14.645
...but I can make it

01:13.245 --> 01:14.645
really great.

01:14.685 --> 01:16.125
We need a pork belly...

01:16.165 --> 01:18.045
It is tough out there,

01:18.085 --> 01:20.925
<i>but businesses that offer</i>

01:18.085 --> 01:20.925
<i>the customer something</i>

01:18.085 --> 01:20.925
<i>different are thriving.</i>

01:20.965 --> 01:22.645
Table nine, please,

01:20.965 --> 01:22.645
how long?

01:22.685 --> 01:25.525
If the business plan is right,

01:22.685 --> 01:25.525
I'll fight to invest.

01:25.565 --> 01:27.085
[women] Service!

01:27.125 --> 01:29.525
[Fred]

01:27.125 --> 01:29.525
<i>The entrepreneurs will face</i>

01:27.125 --> 01:29.525
<i>two high-pressure days</i>

01:29.565 --> 01:31.925
<i>as they run</i>

01:29.565 --> 01:31.925
<i>their own restaurant...</i>

01:31.965 --> 01:33.525
People are giving us orders

01:31.965 --> 01:33.525
without table numbers.

01:33.565 --> 01:35.525
Order 29, no table number.

01:35.565 --> 01:39.205
[Fred]<i> ...and try</i>

01:35.565 --> 01:39.205
<i>to convince the investors</i>

01:35.565 --> 01:39.205
<i>they're worth big money.</i>

01:39.245 --> 01:42.765
We've got Â£350,000

01:39.245 --> 01:42.765
riding on just lunch service.

01:42.805 --> 01:46.285
<i>When the kitchen closes,</i>

01:42.805 --> 01:46.285
<i>will the investors</i>

01:42.805 --> 01:46.285
<i>make them an offer?</i>

01:46.325 --> 01:47.925
Everything's riding on it now.

01:47.965 --> 01:50.565
The doors are open

01:47.965 --> 01:50.565
for business. Welcome.

01:56.685 --> 01:58.925
<i>Today, three entrepreneurs</i>

01:58.965 --> 02:01.245
<i>who dream of owning</i>

01:58.965 --> 02:01.245
<i>their own restaurant</i>

02:01.285 --> 02:04.805
<i>have the opportunity</i>

02:01.285 --> 02:04.805
<i>they've been waiting for.</i>

02:04.845 --> 02:06.805
<i>They've been chosen</i>

02:04.845 --> 02:06.805
<i>to meet investors</i>

02:06.845 --> 02:10.645
<i>hunting for concepts</i>

02:06.845 --> 02:10.645
<i>that could offer</i>

02:06.845 --> 02:10.645
<i>the next big trend</i>

02:10.685 --> 02:12.885
<i>in international cuisine.</i>

02:12.925 --> 02:15.405
Investors know a third

02:12.925 --> 02:15.405
of British customers

02:15.445 --> 02:17.565
are looking for

02:15.445 --> 02:17.565
adventurous flavors

02:17.605 --> 02:19.845
<i>when they go out to eat.</i>

02:19.885 --> 02:24.205
Today, three ideas

02:19.885 --> 02:24.205
that could get customers

02:19.885 --> 02:24.205
paying big money

02:24.245 --> 02:26.805
<i>for new food</i>

02:24.245 --> 02:26.805
<i>from around the world.</i>

02:28.165 --> 02:31.485
<i>The investors try out</i>

02:28.165 --> 02:31.485
<i>hundreds of new ideas a year.</i>

02:31.525 --> 02:34.365
<i>This morning,</i>

02:31.525 --> 02:34.365
<i>they're looking for just one.</i>

02:34.405 --> 02:36.365
Is this the pop-up version

02:34.405 --> 02:36.365
or is this actually

02:34.405 --> 02:36.365
for a restaurant?

02:36.405 --> 02:38.845
[Fred]<i> The most promising</i>

02:36.405 --> 02:38.845
<i>concept will be given</i>

02:38.885 --> 02:40.445
<i>a two-day road test</i>

02:40.485 --> 02:43.005
<i>in this restaurant</i>

02:40.485 --> 02:43.005
<i>in Manchester,</i>

02:43.045 --> 02:44.965
<i>so the investors</i>

02:43.045 --> 02:44.965
<i>can interrogate</i>

02:45.005 --> 02:48.845
<i>every single aspect</i>

02:45.005 --> 02:48.845
<i>of their business.</i>

02:48.885 --> 02:52.245
<i>The three teams here</i>

02:48.885 --> 02:52.245
<i>to prove they've got</i>

02:48.885 --> 02:52.245
<i>real potential...</i>

02:52.285 --> 02:55.285
This is not actual dirt,

02:52.285 --> 02:55.285
this is the, um, edible dirt.

02:55.325 --> 02:56.205
[laughs]

02:56.245 --> 02:57.405
[Fred]<i> Jonas and Naina,</i>

03:00.205 --> 03:02.845
<i>Scandinavian flavors.</i>

03:02.885 --> 03:06.005
[Jonas] Yeah,

03:02.885 --> 03:06.005
the blackened onion,

03:02.885 --> 03:06.005
served with a herbal cream.

03:06.045 --> 03:09.245
We're gonna make you

03:06.045 --> 03:09.245
taste the land, that's

03:06.045 --> 03:09.245
why we're doing this.

03:09.285 --> 03:12.845
We do this every day

03:09.285 --> 03:12.845
and we do it for 200 people.

03:12.885 --> 03:15.005
[Fred]<i> Married couple</i>

<i>They think the UK's ready</i>

03:17.845 --> 03:21.925
<i>for the Canadian classic,</i>

03:17.845 --> 03:21.925
<i>poutine.</i>

03:21.965 --> 03:24.725
[Graham] If you're doing

03:21.965 --> 03:24.725
a dish that's as simple

03:21.965 --> 03:24.725
as poutine,

03:24.765 --> 03:27.005
chips, cheese and gravy,

03:24.765 --> 03:27.005
there's nowhere to hide,

03:24.765 --> 03:27.005
really.

03:27.045 --> 03:28.125
They have to be good.

03:28.165 --> 03:31.005
I've got this.

03:28.165 --> 03:31.005
Stand back.

03:31.045 --> 03:33.845
[Fred]<i> And best friends</i>

03:31.045 --> 03:33.845

03:33.885 --> 03:36.845
<i>They want us to fall in love</i>

03:36.885 --> 03:39.325
<i>with a new style</i>

03:36.885 --> 03:39.325
<i>of regional Spanish food.</i>

03:39.365 --> 03:42.805
[Dave] We're going

03:39.365 --> 03:42.805
to be making this dish

03:39.365 --> 03:42.805
from Castilla de Leon.

03:42.845 --> 03:45.405
Wood-fired artichokes

03:42.845 --> 03:45.405
with haricot beans.

03:49.565 --> 03:52.725
Hello, how are you?

03:49.565 --> 03:52.725
Well, how are you

03:49.565 --> 03:52.725
feeling about today?

03:52.765 --> 03:54.245
-Very good.

03:52.765 --> 03:54.245
-Good.

03:54.285 --> 03:55.405
You should be feeling

03:54.285 --> 03:55.405
fantastic, you know,

03:55.445 --> 03:57.525
because it's an opportunity

03:55.445 --> 03:57.525
of a lifetime.

03:57.565 --> 04:00.805
What the investors

03:57.565 --> 04:00.805
are looking for is the idea

04:00.845 --> 04:03.325
that has the most

04:00.845 --> 04:03.325
investment potential.

04:03.365 --> 04:07.045
Remember, only one of you

04:03.365 --> 04:07.045
can go to Manchester.

04:07.085 --> 04:08.325
Good luck.

04:08.365 --> 04:09.605
[all] Thank you.

04:11.285 --> 04:15.005
[Fred]<i> They have millions</i>

04:11.285 --> 04:15.005
<i>of pounds to fund new ideas,</i>

04:15.045 --> 04:18.685
<i>but these investors back</i>

04:15.045 --> 04:18.685
<i>just a handful of start-ups</i>

04:15.045 --> 04:18.685
<i>each year.</i>

04:18.725 --> 04:19.645
How's it going?

04:19.685 --> 04:21.045
[all] Very good.

04:21.085 --> 04:22.725
Yes, you've had

04:21.085 --> 04:22.725
a good look at the packs?

04:22.765 --> 04:24.325
Yup.

04:24.365 --> 04:26.965
Fundamentally today,

04:24.365 --> 04:26.965
we're going to see

04:24.365 --> 04:26.965
and taste three new ideas.

04:27.005 --> 04:28.965
They want to bring

04:27.005 --> 04:28.965
adventurous flavors

04:29.005 --> 04:30.325
from around the world.

04:30.365 --> 04:33.365
Is this something that has

04:30.365 --> 04:33.365
investment potential?

04:33.405 --> 04:35.085
These flavors have

04:33.405 --> 04:35.085
got to pack a punch.

04:35.125 --> 04:36.845
I think the most

04:35.125 --> 04:36.845
important thing is,

04:36.885 --> 04:38.925
this kind of cuisine needs

04:36.885 --> 04:38.925
to be something that you

04:36.885 --> 04:38.925
can't cook at home.

04:38.965 --> 04:41.685
I'm Jamie Barber, I've opened

04:38.965 --> 04:41.685
dozens of restaurants

04:38.965 --> 04:41.685
in my career.

04:41.725 --> 04:45.365
<i>Over the last five years</i>

04:41.725 --> 04:45.365
<i>there's been an explosion</i>

04:41.725 --> 04:45.365
<i>in the UK</i>

04:45.405 --> 04:49.565
of new tastes, Peruvian,

04:45.405 --> 04:49.565
Brazilian, Mexican, Japanese,

04:49.605 --> 04:51.925
and I think everybody's

04:49.605 --> 04:51.925
looking to try and find

04:51.965 --> 04:56.205
that next big wave

04:51.965 --> 04:56.205
of influences.

04:56.245 --> 04:57.885
If you're gonna bring

04:56.245 --> 04:57.885
new product to the market,

04:57.925 --> 05:00.805
it's got to be different

04:57.925 --> 05:00.805
and there's gotta be

04:57.925 --> 05:00.805
a great story behind it.

05:00.845 --> 05:02.685
There's gotta be a narrative,

05:00.845 --> 05:02.685
there's gotta be a reason

05:00.845 --> 05:02.685
to go,

05:02.725 --> 05:04.165
there's gotta be

05:02.725 --> 05:04.165
experience there.

05:04.205 --> 05:06.525
My name is Darrel Connell.

05:04.205 --> 05:06.525
I'm a partner at Imbiba

05:06.565 --> 05:09.405
and we specialize in making

05:06.565 --> 05:09.405
investments into the best

05:09.445 --> 05:11.925
leisure and hospitality

05:09.445 --> 05:11.925
businesses in the UK.

05:11.965 --> 05:14.285
<i>For me, there are two things</i>

05:11.965 --> 05:14.285
<i>I'm looking for today.</i>

05:14.325 --> 05:15.925
First thing is the quality

05:14.325 --> 05:15.925
of the food,

05:15.965 --> 05:18.005
it has to be absolutely

05:15.965 --> 05:18.005
top notch.

05:18.045 --> 05:20.445
And second of all, the quality

05:18.045 --> 05:20.445
of the management team.

05:20.485 --> 05:21.365
Ready, investors?

05:21.405 --> 05:22.525
-Let's do it.

05:21.405 --> 05:22.525
-[Fred] Right.

05:24.765 --> 05:28.525
<i>First to pitch</i>

05:24.765 --> 05:28.525
<i>are 34-year-old</i>

05:24.765 --> 05:28.525
<i>Danish chef Jonas</i>

05:28.565 --> 05:31.045
<i>and his 32-year-old</i>

05:28.565 --> 05:31.045
<i>wife Naina.</i>

05:31.085 --> 05:34.165
<i>They run a supper club</i>

05:31.085 --> 05:34.165
<i>called MATR.</i>

05:34.205 --> 05:35.965
[Naina]<i> The concept of MATR</i>

05:36.005 --> 05:37.965
is based on the New Nordic

05:36.005 --> 05:37.965
food movement.

05:38.005 --> 05:40.005
<i>We look for wild</i>

05:38.005 --> 05:40.005
<i>foraged foods</i>

05:40.045 --> 05:43.725
that grow on the land,

05:40.045 --> 05:43.725
that are not just farmed.

05:43.765 --> 05:46.245
[Fred]<i> Each team will</i>

05:43.765 --> 05:46.245
<i>be serving the investors</i>

05:46.285 --> 05:48.565
<i>a signature dish</i>

05:46.285 --> 05:48.565
<i>to prove that their food</i>

05:48.605 --> 05:51.485
<i>is as good as their idea.</i>

05:51.525 --> 05:55.485
I call it the alu laukar,

05:51.525 --> 05:55.485
it means leek and ale.

05:55.525 --> 05:57.765
It's one of those

05:55.525 --> 05:57.765
sort of incantations

05:57.805 --> 05:59.445
that's been found

05:57.805 --> 05:59.445
on runestones

05:59.485 --> 06:02.565
throughout the Iron Age

05:59.485 --> 06:02.565
and Viking Age

05:59.485 --> 06:02.565
in Scandinavia.

06:04.485 --> 06:06.045
A little bit of ash...

06:06.085 --> 06:10.165
This is made by simply

06:06.085 --> 06:10.165
burning the crap out of onion.

06:10.205 --> 06:12.685
We're quite excited about

06:10.205 --> 06:12.685
actually getting

06:10.205 --> 06:12.685
the opportunity to present it.

06:14.045 --> 06:15.725
Yet it's nerve-wracking

06:14.045 --> 06:15.725
as well.

06:17.165 --> 06:20.005
I'm really excited about

06:17.165 --> 06:20.005
this New Nordic cuisine.

06:20.045 --> 06:23.405
The foraging and going

06:20.045 --> 06:23.405
back to sort of

06:20.045 --> 06:23.405
plant-based produce,

06:23.445 --> 06:25.805
it's something I find

06:23.445 --> 06:25.805
really interesting.

06:25.845 --> 06:30.125
I'm Matt Farrell,

06:25.845 --> 06:30.125
director and co-founder

06:25.845 --> 06:30.125
of an independent restaurant

06:30.165 --> 06:32.365
<i>and bar company in Liverpool.</i>

06:32.405 --> 06:34.125
<i>Culinary tourism is probably</i>

06:34.165 --> 06:36.005
<i>the fastest-growing type</i>

06:34.165 --> 06:36.005
<i>of tourism there is.</i>

06:36.045 --> 06:37.365
You're looking

06:36.045 --> 06:37.365
for new ideas

06:37.405 --> 06:40.285
to stay on top of things

06:37.405 --> 06:40.285
so that, you know,

06:40.325 --> 06:41.605
you're always moving forward.

06:41.645 --> 06:43.165
There is definitely

06:41.645 --> 06:43.165
a market for it.

06:43.205 --> 06:45.845
In this country,

06:43.205 --> 06:45.845
there are chefs

06:43.205 --> 06:45.845
who do that sort of...

06:45.885 --> 06:48.325
not this sort of food

06:45.885 --> 06:48.325
but that level of food.

06:48.365 --> 06:51.045
So, people behind it needs

06:48.365 --> 06:51.045
to have that kind of profile

06:51.085 --> 06:52.765
to be able to pull this off.

06:52.805 --> 06:54.565
I always say there is always

06:52.805 --> 06:54.565
right kind of money

06:54.605 --> 06:55.925
for right kind of concept.

06:55.965 --> 06:58.205
If the concept

06:55.965 --> 06:58.205
needs Â£150,000

06:58.245 --> 07:00.125
and I like it, so be it.

07:00.165 --> 07:02.365
<i>If concept needs close</i>

07:00.165 --> 07:02.365
<i>to Â£1 million</i>

07:02.405 --> 07:04.845
and if I know I can

07:02.405 --> 07:04.845
afford it, I will go for it.

07:06.925 --> 07:09.365
We have to present it

07:06.925 --> 07:09.365
like this then, okay?

07:09.405 --> 07:10.965
Hmm. What do I

07:09.405 --> 07:10.965
do with the leaf?

07:11.005 --> 07:12.885
[Jonas] There, look how you

07:11.005 --> 07:12.885
put all the other leaves

07:11.005 --> 07:12.885
like that.

07:13.765 --> 07:16.525
There... over there.

07:13.765 --> 07:16.525
Like that.

07:16.565 --> 07:19.445
-All right. Yeah.

07:16.565 --> 07:19.445
-Great. Woo. Let's go!

07:19.485 --> 07:21.485
Let's do this, guys!

07:21.525 --> 07:22.485
[Fred]<i> If they are chosen</i>

07:22.525 --> 07:24.725

07:30.885 --> 07:31.965
-[all] Hello.

07:30.885 --> 07:31.965
-Hi.

07:32.005 --> 07:32.965
Hello, hi.

07:33.005 --> 07:34.245
We have food for you.

07:34.285 --> 07:35.125
[man 2] Fantastic.

07:36.285 --> 07:37.565
Fabulous, thank you.

07:37.605 --> 07:39.085
Thank you

07:37.605 --> 07:39.085
very much indeed.

07:39.125 --> 07:42.045
[Jonas] This is ale and leek,

07:39.125 --> 07:42.045
alu laukar.

07:42.085 --> 07:43.885
It's basically an onion

07:42.085 --> 07:43.885
that's been blackened

07:43.925 --> 07:47.885
then braised in beer

07:43.925 --> 07:47.885
and it's served with

07:43.925 --> 07:47.885
a herbal cream

07:47.925 --> 07:49.205
and edible dirt.

08:00.285 --> 08:01.885
[Fred] Investors,

08:00.285 --> 08:01.885
what do you think?

08:01.925 --> 08:03.605
My mind is a bit blown,

08:01.925 --> 08:03.605
to be honest.

08:03.645 --> 08:04.885
-[all laughing]

08:03.645 --> 08:04.885
-Really?

08:04.925 --> 08:06.485
[Barber] I don't really know

08:04.925 --> 08:06.485
if I like it or not.

08:06.525 --> 08:09.605
I mean, I'm finding it

08:06.525 --> 08:09.605
fascinating and interesting,

08:09.645 --> 08:12.485
but I think I'm finding it

08:09.645 --> 08:12.485
difficult to process.

08:12.525 --> 08:15.445
The execution is just

08:12.525 --> 08:15.445
beyond something I

08:12.525 --> 08:15.445
have seen before,

08:15.485 --> 08:16.725
to be honest,

08:15.485 --> 08:16.725
really, really.

08:16.765 --> 08:18.605
-Blown over it.

08:16.765 --> 08:18.605
Love it. Beautiful.

08:16.765 --> 08:18.605
-Wow.

08:18.645 --> 08:19.605
-That's insane.

08:18.645 --> 08:19.605
-[Kochhar] It's beautiful.

08:19.645 --> 08:22.125
This was thinking

08:19.645 --> 08:22.125
about a forest bed

08:22.165 --> 08:23.165
and how would I

08:22.165 --> 08:23.165
represent that.

08:24.085 --> 08:25.285
[Fred] It's really

08:24.085 --> 08:25.285
reverential.

08:25.325 --> 08:26.605
-[Kochhar] Yeah.

08:25.325 --> 08:26.605
-You're just thinking,

08:26.645 --> 08:29.125
it's almost like you are...

08:26.645 --> 08:29.125
you're praying

08:29.165 --> 08:31.765
at the altar

08:29.165 --> 08:31.765
of this plate, right?

08:31.805 --> 08:33.565
You got it. Yes.

08:33.605 --> 08:36.965
You're asking for Â£970,000

08:33.605 --> 08:36.965
for an investment.

08:37.005 --> 08:41.445
You're also forecasting to do

08:37.005 --> 08:41.445
Â£3.2 million of revenue.

08:41.485 --> 08:45.525
That's a lot of sales.

08:41.485 --> 08:45.525
What's your average spend

08:41.485 --> 08:45.525
per head going to be?

08:45.565 --> 08:47.925
Yeah, so if you take

08:45.565 --> 08:47.925
the nine courses

08:47.965 --> 08:51.245
and you take a wine pairing

08:47.965 --> 08:51.245
you'd spend Â£150.

08:51.285 --> 08:53.005
You know, it's a big,

08:51.285 --> 08:53.005
big, big ask, that.

08:53.045 --> 08:54.725
You're in the top

08:53.045 --> 08:54.725
Michelin bracket

08:54.765 --> 08:56.885
of, you know, two-star,

08:54.765 --> 08:56.885
three-star restaurants.

08:56.925 --> 08:58.165
It's a whole experience.

08:58.205 --> 09:00.645
You step into MATR,

08:58.205 --> 09:00.645
it'll be built from scratch.

09:00.685 --> 09:02.885
There's going to be

09:00.685 --> 09:02.885
a landscape garden

09:00.685 --> 09:02.885
in the middle of it

09:02.925 --> 09:05.805
and that is obviously going

09:02.925 --> 09:05.805
to cost a lot of money.

09:05.845 --> 09:08.045
I strongly believe that

09:05.845 --> 09:08.045
your food has got legs.

09:08.085 --> 09:10.805
If I was to invest

09:08.085 --> 09:10.805
Â£1 million,

09:10.845 --> 09:13.685
what are the credentials

09:10.845 --> 09:13.685
I can tell the world,

09:10.845 --> 09:13.685
this guy can cook?

09:13.725 --> 09:15.525
That's a good question...

09:15.565 --> 09:17.645
[inhales] Well...

09:19.245 --> 09:22.285
You gotta be crazy enough

09:19.245 --> 09:22.285
to do something like this,

09:22.325 --> 09:25.685
and I believe I am

09:22.325 --> 09:25.685
crazy enough, you know.

09:25.725 --> 09:27.525
And I believe that

09:25.725 --> 09:27.525
I can create this food

09:27.565 --> 09:29.445
that's going to really leave

09:27.565 --> 09:29.445
an impact with people.

09:31.925 --> 09:33.645
<i>They like the food.</i>

09:33.685 --> 09:35.565
One of them didn't,

09:33.685 --> 09:35.565
did they? [laughs]

09:35.605 --> 09:38.805
One of them didn't

09:35.605 --> 09:38.805
understand it.

09:35.605 --> 09:38.805
He didn't understand it.

09:42.045 --> 09:45.125

09:50.245 --> 09:54.085

09:50.245 --> 09:54.085
into this for two years now.

09:54.125 --> 09:55.965
<i>I think the dream's to see it</i>

09:56.005 --> 09:59.085
on lots of cosmopolitan

09:56.005 --> 09:59.085
high streets around

09:56.005 --> 09:59.085
the country.

09:59.125 --> 10:02.605
[Fred]<i> They serve</i>

09:59.125 --> 10:02.605

10:06.125 --> 10:09.765
Poutine is a,

10:06.125 --> 10:09.765
it's a relatively simple dish.

10:09.805 --> 10:13.325
<i>Its hand-cut fries,</i>

10:09.805 --> 10:13.325
<i>cheese curds and gravy.</i>

10:13.365 --> 10:14.725
I'm originally

from Quebec

10:14.765 --> 10:17.765
<i>so I was brought up eating</i>

10:14.765 --> 10:17.765
<i>poutine all the time.</i>

10:17.805 --> 10:19.765
[Graham]<i> The cheese</i>

10:17.805 --> 10:19.765
<i>is the key to poutine.</i>

10:19.805 --> 10:22.285
If you don't have the right

10:19.805 --> 10:22.285
squeaky cheese curds...

10:22.325 --> 10:25.045
Then it'll just be

10:22.325 --> 10:25.045
like, um... a total...

10:25.085 --> 10:26.005
It's not poutine.

10:26.045 --> 10:29.765
Cheese soup on your fries.

10:29.805 --> 10:32.685
The poutinerie has been

10:29.805 --> 10:32.685
an established concept

10:29.805 --> 10:32.685
in Canada now

10:32.725 --> 10:34.645
<i>for many years.</i>

10:34.685 --> 10:38.085
You have the American diner,

10:34.685 --> 10:38.085
you have a Mexican cantina,

10:38.125 --> 10:42.565
so why would another

10:38.125 --> 10:42.565
North American concept

10:38.125 --> 10:42.565
not be a success?

10:44.725 --> 10:46.085
[Fred] I mean,

10:44.725 --> 10:46.085
it's very big in Quebec,

10:46.125 --> 10:49.245
poutine is huge,

10:46.125 --> 10:49.245
everybody eats it.

10:49.285 --> 10:50.925
To be a single-product

10:49.285 --> 10:50.925
business,

10:50.965 --> 10:53.685
be it pizza

10:50.965 --> 10:53.685
or burger or pasta,

10:53.725 --> 10:56.445
product quality has to be

10:53.725 --> 10:56.445
absolutely spot on.

10:56.485 --> 10:57.965
It has to be

10:56.485 --> 10:57.965
a very powerful dish.

10:58.005 --> 10:59.965
So, it'll be very interesting

10:58.005 --> 10:59.965
to see with poutine,

11:00.005 --> 11:01.285
has it got that strength?

11:02.925 --> 11:04.525
[Graham] I'm really hoping

11:02.925 --> 11:04.525
they say nice things,

11:04.565 --> 11:06.965
because I've got

11:04.565 --> 11:06.965
quite a fragile ego.

11:04.565 --> 11:06.965
[laughs]

11:09.605 --> 11:11.005
Put a little bit

11:09.605 --> 11:11.005
more cheese on.

11:12.405 --> 11:13.685
Make it good.

11:15.005 --> 11:16.965
Okay, I think

11:15.005 --> 11:16.965
we are ready to go.

-Wow.

-I am just gonna give...

11:28.845 --> 11:29.965
-Oh, gosh.

11:28.845 --> 11:29.965

our Reuben poutine,

11:35.725 --> 11:37.885
it's house-made

11:35.725 --> 11:37.885
pastrami, pickles,

11:37.925 --> 11:41.405
fries, squeaky Quebec-style

11:37.925 --> 11:41.405
cheese curds and a veal gravy.

11:41.445 --> 11:42.765
Let me say it loud,

11:42.805 --> 11:44.525
I defy anybody

11:42.805 --> 11:44.525
not to like that.

11:44.565 --> 11:45.565
[laughs]

11:45.605 --> 11:46.445
[Kochhar] It is tasty,

11:45.605 --> 11:46.445
definitely.

11:47.645 --> 11:49.805
So, is it always

11:47.645 --> 11:49.805
there's a new topping on it?

11:49.845 --> 11:52.965
We do everything

11:49.845 --> 11:52.965
from a smoked salmon

11:49.845 --> 11:52.965
with hollandaise sauce...

11:53.005 --> 11:54.205
Maple barbecue...

11:54.245 --> 11:56.565
We do a maple pulled pork

11:54.245 --> 11:56.565
barbecue version

11:56.605 --> 11:58.565
with a pink slaw

11:56.605 --> 11:58.565
on top of it.

11:58.605 --> 11:59.805
Do you make

11:58.605 --> 11:59.805
the jus yourself?

11:59.845 --> 12:01.765
[Graham] We do. We do,

11:59.845 --> 12:01.765
it's a veal-based jus.

12:01.805 --> 12:03.205
[Barber] And where do

12:01.805 --> 12:03.205
you make that?

12:03.245 --> 12:05.245
In our house, currently,

12:05.285 --> 12:08.325
which is why we're screaming

12:05.285 --> 12:08.325
out for an investment.

12:08.365 --> 12:10.085
[Connell] I think the first

12:08.365 --> 12:10.085
thing to say is the food

12:08.365 --> 12:10.085
is absolutely delicious.

12:10.125 --> 12:13.645
It's so more-ish.

12:10.125 --> 12:13.645
I keep pushing it away

12:10.125 --> 12:13.645
to stop myself eating it.

12:13.685 --> 12:16.005
I guess the big question

12:13.685 --> 12:16.005
I've got,

12:16.045 --> 12:19.565
is the UK market ready

12:16.045 --> 12:19.565
for a poutine chain?

12:19.605 --> 12:21.765
To me that's not yet clear.

12:21.805 --> 12:24.565
We see it following

12:21.805 --> 12:24.565
a very similar path

12:24.605 --> 12:28.245
to burrito-style bars

12:24.605 --> 12:28.245
that are in every city now.

12:28.285 --> 12:30.805
The difference, I think,

12:28.285 --> 12:30.805
with the burrito market

12:30.845 --> 12:34.045
is there is a perception

12:30.845 --> 12:34.045
that you can go

12:30.845 --> 12:34.045
to those places

12:34.085 --> 12:35.245
and eat healthily.

12:35.285 --> 12:37.485
Whereas, as much as this

12:35.285 --> 12:37.485
is absolutely delicious,

12:37.525 --> 12:38.645
you wouldn't want

12:37.525 --> 12:38.645
to overdo it.

12:38.685 --> 12:40.885
It's a treat, you know,

12:38.685 --> 12:40.885
in the same way

12:40.925 --> 12:42.965
that we would have

12:40.925 --> 12:42.965
fish and chips as a treat.

12:43.005 --> 12:44.005
It's a treat.

12:44.045 --> 12:45.565
But we have people

12:44.045 --> 12:45.565
that come back,

12:45.605 --> 12:46.925
and they come back

12:45.605 --> 12:46.925
multiple times a week.

12:48.165 --> 12:52.085
Can I just say<i> merci,</i>

12:48.165 --> 12:52.085
and fantastic, well done.

12:52.125 --> 12:53.005
Thank you very much.

12:53.045 --> 12:54.285
-Good luck.

12:53.045 --> 12:54.285
-[Graham] Bye-bye.

12:55.565 --> 12:57.245
[Fred] Well done, guys.

12:57.285 --> 12:59.125
I just hope that

12:57.285 --> 12:59.125
they can see it now

12:59.165 --> 13:01.325
being the same kind of business

12:59.165 --> 13:01.325
that we can see it being.

13:06.285 --> 13:09.965
[Fred]<i> The last team</i>

13:15.645 --> 13:18.325
<i>Their idea is based</i>

13:15.645 --> 13:18.325

13:18.365 --> 13:21.125
<i>on the famous pilgrimage</i>

13:18.365 --> 13:21.125
<i>in northwest Spain,</i>

13:21.165 --> 13:23.765

13:23.805 --> 13:26.205
I walked that

13:23.805 --> 13:26.205
last year in May

13:26.245 --> 13:30.205
and as I was walking it

13:26.245 --> 13:30.205
I could see

13:26.245 --> 13:30.205
the different produce

13:30.245 --> 13:32.765
that was growing in the fields

13:30.245 --> 13:32.765
of the different regions,

13:32.805 --> 13:35.725
<i>and so ended up</i>

13:32.805 --> 13:35.725
<i>with this concept.</i>

13:35.765 --> 13:37.925
<i>The menu will start</i>

13:35.765 --> 13:37.925
<i>with the first course,</i>

13:37.965 --> 13:40.365
in the starting point

13:37.965 --> 13:40.365
of the route,

13:40.405 --> 13:43.125
and then the dishes

13:40.405 --> 13:43.125
will work their way

13:43.165 --> 13:44.445
to Santiago de Compostela,

13:44.485 --> 13:46.205
which

13:44.485 --> 13:46.205
is the final destination.

13:46.245 --> 13:49.125
[Fred]<i> They've spent</i>

13:46.245 --> 13:49.125
<i>the last two years</i>

13:46.245 --> 13:49.125
<i>planning Pilgrim.</i>

13:49.165 --> 13:53.285
<i>Now they need an investment</i>

13:49.165 --> 13:53.285
<i>to turn it into a reality.</i>

13:53.325 --> 13:55.485
This is now for me

13:53.325 --> 13:55.485
something more than a job.

13:55.525 --> 13:57.845
<i>This is something</i>

13:55.525 --> 13:57.845
<i>we care deeply about.</i>

13:59.325 --> 14:00.885
We've stopped

13:59.325 --> 14:00.885
our full-time jobs,

14:00.925 --> 14:03.805
we've stopped everything

14:00.925 --> 14:03.805
and just put everything

14:00.925 --> 14:03.805
into Pilgrim.

14:03.845 --> 14:05.885
Um, so yeah,

14:03.845 --> 14:05.885
this is the moment.

14:07.725 --> 14:11.365
[Ant] So, the artichokes

14:07.725 --> 14:11.365
have been poached off

14:07.725 --> 14:11.365
in white wine vinegar,

14:11.405 --> 14:12.565
some lemon juice

14:11.405 --> 14:12.565
and then,

14:12.605 --> 14:14.445
yeah, we're going to

14:12.605 --> 14:14.445
chargrill them now.

14:14.485 --> 14:16.485
Give them a little bit

14:14.485 --> 14:16.485
of extra flavor.

14:17.405 --> 14:18.765
[Farrell]<i> I love the story.</i>

14:18.805 --> 14:21.205
I think it could be something

14:18.805 --> 14:21.205
I'm really interested in.

14:21.245 --> 14:23.565
I do like the fact that

14:21.245 --> 14:23.565
they've covered all bases

14:23.605 --> 14:26.005
with the experience

14:23.605 --> 14:26.005
with the three of them.

14:26.045 --> 14:28.245
And I think we are ready

14:26.045 --> 14:28.245
to start plating...

14:30.045 --> 14:31.165
Starting to shake.

14:33.485 --> 14:35.445
[Ant] Done?

14:35.485 --> 14:36.925
[Fred]<i> Jamie,</i>

14:35.485 --> 14:36.925
<i>Ant and Dave</i>

14:42.885 --> 14:45.005

14:45.045 --> 14:46.045
-Hi, guys.

14:45.045 --> 14:46.045
-Hi.

14:46.085 --> 14:46.965
-Hello.

14:46.085 --> 14:46.965
-How you doing?

14:47.005 --> 14:47.885
Hello, hello.

14:47.925 --> 14:49.365
[indistinct chatter]

14:53.045 --> 14:54.725
[Dave] You have in front

14:53.045 --> 14:54.725
of you wood-fired artichokes,

14:54.765 --> 14:58.045
with botanical broth

14:54.765 --> 14:58.045
and haricot beans.

15:03.645 --> 15:05.805
[Fred] Investors,

15:03.645 --> 15:05.805
what's your first impression

15:03.645 --> 15:05.805
on the food?

15:06.565 --> 15:08.245
[Kochhar] Very Spanish.

15:08.285 --> 15:11.085
Very bold flavors.

15:08.285 --> 15:11.085
Beautifully cooked.

15:11.125 --> 15:13.765
Really good.

15:11.125 --> 15:13.765
Wine goes well with it,

15:11.125 --> 15:13.765
cleans the palate.

15:15.285 --> 15:17.085
Think I maybe would've liked

15:15.285 --> 15:17.085
to have seen something

15:17.125 --> 15:18.165
a little bit more complex.

15:18.205 --> 15:21.085
But it was very tasty.

15:21.125 --> 15:23.285
The Camino is a very

15:21.125 --> 15:23.285
well-known pilgrimage,

15:23.325 --> 15:25.605
so I think wrapping

15:23.325 --> 15:25.605
a restaurant around

15:23.325 --> 15:25.605
that narrative

15:25.645 --> 15:26.845
is a great idea.

15:26.885 --> 15:28.605
I've never heard

15:26.885 --> 15:28.605
of the Camino.

15:28.645 --> 15:30.605
-No?

15:28.645 --> 15:30.605
-Maybe I'm very ignorant,

15:30.645 --> 15:32.645
so you know, I'm struggling

15:30.645 --> 15:32.645
to get the concept.

15:32.685 --> 15:34.405
If you're not sure

15:32.685 --> 15:34.405
of the concept

15:34.445 --> 15:37.045
then we're also about giving

15:34.445 --> 15:37.045
you a great plate of food.

15:37.085 --> 15:39.325
One of the inspirations

15:37.085 --> 15:39.325
of the Camino

15:39.365 --> 15:41.805
is that you really get away

15:39.365 --> 15:41.805
from croquettes

15:41.845 --> 15:44.245
and patatas bravas

15:41.845 --> 15:44.245
and<i> jamon</i> legs

15:41.845 --> 15:44.245
and things like that.

15:44.285 --> 15:46.405
[Jamie] The way we're

15:44.285 --> 15:46.405
taking the Spanish food is,

15:46.445 --> 15:48.125
would probably attract you

15:46.445 --> 15:48.125
if you've never heard

15:46.445 --> 15:48.125
of the Camino.

15:49.085 --> 15:50.925
We're 70% plant-based.

15:51.565 --> 15:53.045
Okay.

15:53.085 --> 15:54.685
I'm going to ask

15:53.085 --> 15:54.685
the investors now

15:53.085 --> 15:54.685
to give you some feedback.

15:54.725 --> 15:57.445
You know, if they were

15:54.725 --> 15:57.445
going to choose you

15:54.725 --> 15:57.445
to go to Manchester,

15:57.485 --> 15:59.085
what do they want to see?

15:59.125 --> 16:03.565
It's very difficult to judge

15:59.125 --> 16:03.565
an entire concept

15:59.125 --> 16:03.565
based on one dish.

16:03.605 --> 16:05.165
I'm still trying

16:03.605 --> 16:05.165
to understand

16:06.445 --> 16:10.045
where it sits on the scale

16:06.445 --> 16:10.045
of fun to seriousness.

16:10.085 --> 16:11.165
I'm also really

16:10.085 --> 16:11.165
intrigued to see

16:11.205 --> 16:12.405
how you're going

16:11.205 --> 16:12.405
to bring the Camino to us.

16:12.445 --> 16:14.085
You can have a restaurant

16:12.445 --> 16:14.085
that tells that story

16:14.125 --> 16:16.925
and it's an incredibly

16:14.125 --> 16:16.925
powerful experience.

16:16.965 --> 16:18.045
[Fred] Thank you

16:16.965 --> 16:18.045
very much, guys.

16:18.085 --> 16:19.405
[all] Thank you.

16:21.645 --> 16:22.605
Well done.

16:23.725 --> 16:24.845
-Whoo!

16:23.725 --> 16:24.845
-[laughs]

16:26.085 --> 16:28.085
That was...

16:26.085 --> 16:28.085
That was something

16:26.085 --> 16:28.085
else, huh?

16:30.565 --> 16:33.525
Investors, we have three

16:30.565 --> 16:33.525
strong ideas on the table.

16:33.565 --> 16:35.565
<i>The investors</i>

16:33.565 --> 16:35.565
<i>will choose the best idea</i>

16:35.605 --> 16:38.885
<i>for a trial run in Manchester</i>

16:35.605 --> 16:38.885
<i>by majority vote,</i>

16:38.925 --> 16:41.765
<i>but can pull out</i>

16:38.925 --> 16:41.765
<i>if they're not interested.</i>

16:41.805 --> 16:43.165
So, let's start with MATR.

16:44.325 --> 16:46.525
I mean, that got

16:44.325 --> 16:46.525
you all thinking.

16:46.565 --> 16:49.365
We had one who said

16:46.565 --> 16:49.365
he'd never tried

16:46.565 --> 16:49.365
anything like it,

16:49.405 --> 16:52.525
-but I wasn't sure whether

16:49.405 --> 16:52.525
that was positive...

16:49.405 --> 16:52.525
-[laughs]

16:52.565 --> 16:54.645
...or negative.

16:54.685 --> 16:56.685
Is he crazy,

16:54.685 --> 16:56.685
is he a genius?

16:56.725 --> 16:58.605
I have absolutely no idea.

16:58.645 --> 17:00.725
I think out of all the people

16:58.645 --> 17:00.725
that we've seen today,

17:00.765 --> 17:04.685
he's probably the one

17:00.765 --> 17:04.685
that I'm intrigued

17:00.765 --> 17:04.685
to see more of.

17:04.725 --> 17:07.565
The business side of it

17:04.725 --> 17:07.565
doesn't stack up for me

17:04.725 --> 17:07.565
in the slightest.

17:07.605 --> 17:09.485
I'm afraid, a restaurant

17:07.605 --> 17:09.485
I would love to go and eat at

17:09.525 --> 17:11.565
but not one

17:09.525 --> 17:11.565
I'd wish to invest in.

17:11.605 --> 17:13.205
So, let's look

17:11.605 --> 17:13.205
at Blue Caribou Canteen.

17:13.245 --> 17:15.805
They enjoyed the food,

17:13.245 --> 17:15.805
which I guess is,

17:15.845 --> 17:19.445
if nothing else happens,

17:15.845 --> 17:19.445
at least we can walk away

17:15.845 --> 17:19.445
knowing that

17:19.485 --> 17:21.165
those guys enjoyed our food.

17:22.605 --> 17:25.685
Having been to Canada

17:22.605 --> 17:25.685
many times, I know

17:22.605 --> 17:25.685
this thing works.

17:25.725 --> 17:27.165
You know, I really

17:25.725 --> 17:27.165
like the guys.

17:27.205 --> 17:29.805
I like their authenticity

17:27.205 --> 17:29.805
and the love they have

17:27.205 --> 17:29.805
behind it.

17:29.845 --> 17:33.405
I just don't think that

17:29.845 --> 17:33.405
can translate into any

17:29.845 --> 17:33.405
sort of investment.

17:33.445 --> 17:34.925
What about Pilgrim?

17:34.965 --> 17:37.605
Good feedback, they liked

17:34.965 --> 17:37.605
the food and the wine.

17:39.645 --> 17:41.205
Overall, I think,

17:39.645 --> 17:41.205
I really liked the pitch.

17:41.245 --> 17:43.885
The numbers were perfect,

17:41.245 --> 17:43.885
the food was good,

17:43.925 --> 17:45.005
the wine was good.

17:45.045 --> 17:46.245
The only thing

17:45.045 --> 17:46.245
we're missing

17:46.285 --> 17:48.645
is whether the guys

17:46.285 --> 17:48.645
can actually deliver it.

17:48.685 --> 17:51.565
I didn't find the food

17:48.685 --> 17:51.565
or the concept strong enough.

17:51.605 --> 17:55.245
And I didn't find the team

17:51.605 --> 17:55.245
compelling enough to back.

17:55.285 --> 17:57.365
We've had some

17:55.285 --> 17:57.365
good discussion

17:55.285 --> 17:57.365
around the table,

17:57.405 --> 17:59.725
but you need to make

17:57.405 --> 17:59.725
a decision, guys.

18:00.605 --> 18:01.925
Who is going to Manchester?

18:04.605 --> 18:06.965
<i>Someone is about</i>

18:04.605 --> 18:06.965
<i>to be a step closer</i>

18:07.005 --> 18:08.965
<i>to the dream</i>

18:07.005 --> 18:08.965
<i>of their own restaurant.</i>

18:12.085 --> 18:13.765
This is the moment of truth.

18:15.085 --> 18:17.005
Well, I have to say

18:15.085 --> 18:17.005
you've all done very well.

18:17.045 --> 18:19.285
And the investors were split.

18:19.325 --> 18:22.485
There can only be

18:19.325 --> 18:22.485
one business going

18:19.325 --> 18:22.485
to Manchester.

18:22.525 --> 18:25.685
And the idea that

18:22.525 --> 18:25.685
has the most potential

18:22.525 --> 18:25.685
for investment

18:26.885 --> 18:27.885
is Pilgrim.

18:27.925 --> 18:29.205
-[sighs]

18:27.925 --> 18:29.205
-Well done, guys.

18:31.845 --> 18:33.165
[Connell]<i> I'm looking</i>

18:31.845 --> 18:33.165
<i>forward to seeing</i>

18:33.205 --> 18:35.165
how they're going

18:33.205 --> 18:35.165
to bring the Camino story,

18:35.205 --> 18:37.005
which seems to be center

18:35.205 --> 18:37.005
to their proposition,

18:37.045 --> 18:38.845
<i>how are they going</i>

18:37.045 --> 18:38.845
<i>to bring that to life?</i>

18:38.885 --> 18:40.045
[Farrell]<i> I think with Pilgrim,</i>

18:38.885 --> 18:40.045
<i>where they've picked</i>

18:38.885 --> 18:40.045
<i>in the world,</i>

18:40.085 --> 18:41.645
<i>I really love that region.</i>

18:41.685 --> 18:44.325
I'd like to see them

18:41.685 --> 18:44.325
coming out of their shell

18:41.685 --> 18:44.325
a little bit.

18:44.365 --> 18:45.965
[Kochhar]<i> I want to see</i>

18:44.365 --> 18:45.965
<i>more dishes from them.</i>

18:46.005 --> 18:48.165
<i>I love northern Spain,</i>

18:46.005 --> 18:48.165
<i>always have.</i>

18:48.205 --> 18:50.285
I just like the humble food,

18:50.325 --> 18:53.485
how it gets turned

18:50.325 --> 18:53.485
into great cuisine.

18:53.525 --> 18:55.125
I mean, you've done very well

18:55.165 --> 18:57.725
because three out of four

18:55.165 --> 18:57.725
are going there.

18:57.765 --> 18:59.565
Jamie was simply

18:57.765 --> 18:59.565
not interested.

19:00.325 --> 19:02.285
Pilgrim didn't pull me,

19:02.325 --> 19:04.565
and I think, sometimes

19:02.325 --> 19:04.565
when you make an investment,

19:04.605 --> 19:06.245
it's a bit like buying

19:04.605 --> 19:06.245
a flat or a house.

19:06.285 --> 19:08.605
You kind of know

19:06.285 --> 19:08.605
when it's right,

19:08.645 --> 19:10.045
when you step

19:08.645 --> 19:10.045
through the door.

19:10.085 --> 19:12.285
And for me,

19:10.085 --> 19:12.285
I just didn't feel that.

19:12.325 --> 19:13.525
[Fred] Anyway,

19:12.325 --> 19:13.525
I leave you to it.

19:13.565 --> 19:15.125
Enjoy the celebrations,

19:13.565 --> 19:15.125
congratulations again.

19:15.165 --> 19:16.405
-Thank you.

19:15.165 --> 19:16.405
-Thank you very much.

19:16.445 --> 19:17.685
-Take care.

19:16.445 --> 19:17.685
-[Jamie] Fred, thank you.

19:17.725 --> 19:19.165
-Have a good evening. Bye.

19:17.725 --> 19:19.165
-[Dave] Cheers. Bye.

19:19.205 --> 19:22.045
Three out of four as well...

19:22.085 --> 19:24.845
[Ant] We did what we said

19:22.085 --> 19:24.845
we were going to come here

19:22.085 --> 19:24.845
and do so...

19:24.885 --> 19:26.285
-Step it up a level

19:24.885 --> 19:26.285
now, right?

19:24.885 --> 19:26.285
-Yeah.

19:27.525 --> 19:29.285
[all] Cheers.

19:29.925 --> 19:30.845
<i>Salud.</i>

19:41.045 --> 19:43.965
[Fred]<i> Today,</i>

19:41.045 --> 19:43.965
<i>a new restaurant</i>

19:41.045 --> 19:43.965
<i>opens in Manchester.</i>

19:44.005 --> 19:46.045
Pilgrim have just

19:44.005 --> 19:46.045
two days to convince

19:46.085 --> 19:47.925
some of the country's

19:46.085 --> 19:47.925
top investors

19:47.965 --> 19:49.445
that they are worth

19:47.965 --> 19:49.445
their money.

19:49.485 --> 19:50.565
[Ant] Where are we going?

19:50.605 --> 19:52.765
[Dave] I think it's down

19:50.605 --> 19:52.765
here on the right.

19:52.805 --> 19:56.525
[Fred]<i> The Pilgrim boys</i>

19:52.805 --> 19:56.525
<i>want their own restaurant</i>

19:52.805 --> 19:56.525
<i>so badly.</i>

19:56.565 --> 20:00.485
They need that

19:56.565 --> 20:00.485
Â£400,000 investment.

19:56.565 --> 20:00.485
It won't be easy.

20:00.525 --> 20:03.125
But together

20:00.525 --> 20:03.125
they are a strong combination.

20:03.165 --> 20:05.325
<i>A great chef,</i>

20:03.165 --> 20:05.325
<i>a great marketeer</i>

20:05.365 --> 20:07.805
<i>and a great front of house</i>

20:05.365 --> 20:07.805
<i>with a vision.</i>

20:07.845 --> 20:10.405
<i>Tonight, Jamie, Ant and Dave</i>

20:10.445 --> 20:12.565
<i>will open</i>

20:10.445 --> 20:12.565
<i>to the paying public.</i>

20:12.605 --> 20:14.525
Here it is,

20:12.605 --> 20:14.525
look, Pilgrim.

20:14.565 --> 20:16.925
[Fred]<i> And they are about</i>

20:14.565 --> 20:16.925
<i>to see their new restaurant</i>

20:16.965 --> 20:18.925
<i>for the very first time.</i>

20:18.965 --> 20:20.325
This is it. Looks good,

20:18.965 --> 20:20.325
doesn't it?

20:20.365 --> 20:22.765
Shall we open that up

20:20.365 --> 20:22.765
and get in there?

20:25.445 --> 20:26.565
[Jamie] All right, here we go.

20:26.605 --> 20:27.485
Here we go.

20:28.805 --> 20:30.765
Oh, wow, look at this.

20:30.805 --> 20:32.365
This looks fantastic.

20:32.405 --> 20:34.445
[Ant] Awesome. Nice.

20:36.965 --> 20:39.325
[Fred]<i> The team have been</i>

20:36.965 --> 20:39.325
<i>working with a designer</i>

20:39.365 --> 20:43.085
<i>so they can show</i>

20:39.365 --> 20:43.085
<i>the investors</i>

20:39.365 --> 20:43.085
<i>their vision for Pilgrim.</i>

20:44.725 --> 20:45.845
There's a Mary.

20:46.445 --> 20:48.605
[indistinct chatter]

20:48.645 --> 20:50.365
It's a lot bigger than I

20:48.645 --> 20:50.365
thought it was going to be.

20:51.685 --> 20:53.685
It's a lot more real.

20:53.725 --> 20:56.525
Fifty covers in eight hours.

20:53.725 --> 20:56.525
Are we ready for this, boys?

20:56.565 --> 20:58.885
I need to get in the kitchen,

20:56.565 --> 20:58.885
that's what I think.

20:58.925 --> 21:00.725
[Fred]

20:58.925 --> 21:00.725
<i>For the next 48 hours,</i>

21:00.765 --> 21:05.405
<i>the investors will watch</i>

21:00.765 --> 21:05.405
<i>Jamie, Dave and Ant work</i>

21:00.765 --> 21:05.405
<i>under pressure.</i>

21:05.445 --> 21:09.605
<i>Only then will they decide</i>

21:05.445 --> 21:09.605
<i>whether they're worth</i>

21:05.445 --> 21:09.605
<i>an investment.</i>

21:09.645 --> 21:11.805
Between us, we've got

21:09.645 --> 21:11.805
50 years' experience.

21:11.845 --> 21:15.165
But experience

21:11.845 --> 21:15.165
working for other people.

21:15.205 --> 21:17.325
And this is the first time

21:15.205 --> 21:17.325
we're doing it for ourselves.

21:19.445 --> 21:22.885
[Fred]<i> Eighteen months ago,</i>

21:19.445 --> 21:22.885
<i>Jamie, the man behind</i>

21:19.445 --> 21:22.885
<i>Pilgrim,</i>

21:22.925 --> 21:25.765
<i>went on a life-changing trip.</i>

21:25.805 --> 21:28.525
[Jamie]<i> I walked</i>

21:25.805 --> 21:28.525
<i>the Camino de Santiago.</i>

21:28.565 --> 21:29.925
It's roughly a 500-mile walk,

21:29.965 --> 21:32.405
<i>it took me 30 days</i>

21:29.965 --> 21:32.405
<i>to walk it.</i>

21:32.445 --> 21:34.845
[Fred]<i> His slow journey</i>

21:32.445 --> 21:34.845
<i>through Northern Spain</i>

21:34.885 --> 21:38.205
<i>on Europe's most famous</i>

21:34.885 --> 21:38.205
<i>pilgrimage inspired him.</i>

21:38.245 --> 21:39.405
The produce

21:38.245 --> 21:39.405
they have to offer,

21:39.445 --> 21:41.645
it just suddenly,

21:39.445 --> 21:41.645
like, clicked that

21:41.685 --> 21:43.525
<i>this would actually</i>

21:41.685 --> 21:43.525
<i>be a great concept.</i>

21:43.565 --> 21:44.805
[Fred]

21:43.565 --> 21:44.805
<i>When Jamie got back,</i>

21:44.845 --> 21:47.285
<i>he convinced best friends</i>

21:44.845 --> 21:47.285
<i>Dave and Ant</i>

21:47.325 --> 21:50.205
<i>to help him bring</i>

21:47.325 --> 21:50.205
<i>Pilgrim to life.</i>

21:50.245 --> 21:53.765
Dave is our main man,

21:50.245 --> 21:53.765
he's our head chef.

21:53.805 --> 21:57.485
I'm lucky enough to work

21:53.805 --> 21:57.485
with some very prestigious

21:53.805 --> 21:57.485
places in London,

21:57.525 --> 22:00.005
J Sheekey, The Wolseley.

22:00.045 --> 22:02.805
[Jamie]<i> Ant,</i>

22:00.045 --> 22:02.805
<i>he's in charge</i>

22:00.045 --> 22:02.805
<i>of marketing.</i>

22:02.845 --> 22:05.205
I'm a little bit older

22:02.845 --> 22:05.205
than the other guys, I'm 46.

22:05.245 --> 22:07.325
<i>I was a chef</i>

22:05.245 --> 22:07.325
<i>for 15 years and then</i>

22:07.365 --> 22:09.245
<i>I've spent the last ten years</i>

22:09.285 --> 22:11.605
working as a brand manager

22:09.285 --> 22:11.605
and event manager.

22:12.405 --> 22:13.965
-Whoo!

22:12.405 --> 22:13.965
-[laughs]

22:14.005 --> 22:16.925
Jamie's in charge,

22:14.005 --> 22:16.925
simply for the fact

22:14.005 --> 22:16.925
that it's his concept,

22:16.965 --> 22:18.965
he walked the Camino.

22:19.005 --> 22:22.285
[Jamie]<i> I can only work</i>

22:19.005 --> 22:22.285
<i>as well as my team.</i>

22:22.325 --> 22:25.165
And they're the talent.

22:22.325 --> 22:25.165
I just manage the talent,

22:22.325 --> 22:25.165
that's how I see it.

22:26.365 --> 22:27.565
[both exclaiming]

22:33.365 --> 22:36.485
The look and feel

22:33.365 --> 22:36.485
of a restaurant

22:33.365 --> 22:36.485
is so important.

22:36.525 --> 22:40.405
<i>It's a big part</i>

22:36.525 --> 22:40.405
<i>of why customers</i>

22:36.525 --> 22:40.405
<i>choose where to go.</i>

22:40.445 --> 22:42.525
Pilgrim wants to be

22:40.445 --> 22:42.525
fresh and modern.

22:42.565 --> 22:45.045
There will be

22:42.565 --> 22:45.045
no Spanish cliches.

22:42.565 --> 22:45.045
No bullfighting.

22:45.085 --> 22:47.605
No flamenco,

22:45.085 --> 22:47.605
no castanets.<i> Ole.</i>

22:49.285 --> 22:52.045
From what

22:49.285 --> 22:52.045
the investors' feedback was

22:49.285 --> 22:52.045
when we saw them,

22:52.085 --> 22:53.325
I think one of the concerns

22:53.365 --> 22:55.605
<i>was how we communicate</i>

22:53.365 --> 22:55.605
<i>this story behind us.</i>

22:57.405 --> 23:00.325
<i>The way the place looks</i>

22:57.405 --> 23:00.325
<i>needs to let people know</i>

23:00.365 --> 23:03.245
<i>that we're not just</i>

23:00.365 --> 23:03.245
<i>a theme restaurant</i>

23:00.365 --> 23:03.245
<i>or something like that.</i>

23:05.125 --> 23:06.925
It does look good,

23:05.125 --> 23:06.925
doesn't it? I'm really

23:05.125 --> 23:06.925
happy with it.

23:09.965 --> 23:12.125
[Fred]<i> Pilgrim have asked</i>

23:09.965 --> 23:12.125
<i>some of the best kitchen</i>

23:19.045 --> 23:20.245
Dan, how are you doing?

23:20.285 --> 23:21.245
What do you reckon?

23:21.285 --> 23:23.165
[indistinct chatter]

23:23.205 --> 23:25.325
-Ready?

23:23.205 --> 23:25.325
-[man] Let's do it.

23:25.365 --> 23:27.845
-[Dave] Jamie, we're

23:25.365 --> 23:27.845
on twelve o'clock, mate...

23:25.365 --> 23:27.845
-[Jamie] Yeah.

23:27.885 --> 23:29.685
...so five hours

23:27.885 --> 23:29.685

23:29.725 --> 23:30.685
You all right setting up?

23:30.725 --> 23:31.765
[Jamie] Yeah, mate, all good.

one of the best chefs

23:37.725 --> 23:40.085
in London.

23:40.125 --> 23:41.565
That's ten minutes

23:40.125 --> 23:41.565
in the oven.

23:41.605 --> 23:44.045
I'm going to leave that

23:41.605 --> 23:44.045
like that, I think.

23:44.085 --> 23:46.325
[Dan]<i> For them to get</i>

23:44.085 --> 23:46.325
<i>the investment</i>

23:44.085 --> 23:46.325
<i>would be massive.</i>

23:46.365 --> 23:47.565
This is everything for them.

23:53.685 --> 23:56.285
-Morning. Good to see you.

23:53.685 --> 23:56.285
-How you doing?

23:56.325 --> 23:59.445
This is it. You guys

23:56.325 --> 23:59.445
look like a rock band.

23:59.485 --> 24:01.685
[all laughing]

24:01.725 --> 24:03.685
I feel like one

24:01.725 --> 24:03.685
at the moment,

24:01.725 --> 24:03.685
I can tell you.

24:03.725 --> 24:06.485
Are you feeling good today?

24:03.725 --> 24:06.485
Are you feeling energized?

24:03.725 --> 24:06.485
Are you excited?

24:06.525 --> 24:08.005
Quite nervous, to be honest.

24:08.045 --> 24:09.845
Yeah, it's a big deal,

24:08.045 --> 24:09.845
isn't it? Cooking

24:08.045 --> 24:09.845
for the investors.

24:09.885 --> 24:11.605
[Fred] You know the investors

24:09.885 --> 24:11.605
were talking about

24:11.645 --> 24:17.005
how you are going

24:11.645 --> 24:17.005
to translate this pilgrimage

24:11.645 --> 24:17.005
idea into a restaurant.

24:17.045 --> 24:18.485
Have you thought

24:17.045 --> 24:18.485
about that?

24:18.525 --> 24:21.245
The way our menu works,

24:18.525 --> 24:21.245
it's a five-course

24:18.525 --> 24:21.245
tasting menu.

24:21.285 --> 24:24.045
The first course starts

24:21.285 --> 24:24.045
at the beginning of a route

24:24.085 --> 24:27.005
of the Camino de Santiago

24:24.085 --> 24:27.005
and each course moves along

24:27.045 --> 24:28.405
until you get

24:27.045 --> 24:28.405
to the final destination,

24:28.445 --> 24:30.045
Santiago de Compostela.

24:30.085 --> 24:33.805
Fantastic. You've got

24:30.085 --> 24:33.805
three fantastic investors

24:30.085 --> 24:33.805
coming tonight.

24:33.845 --> 24:36.005
You know, you've got

24:33.845 --> 24:36.005
everything to play for.

24:36.045 --> 24:37.365
-[Dave] Thank you.

24:36.045 --> 24:37.365
-Good luck, guys.

24:40.285 --> 24:41.765
I like the three<i> amigos.</i>

24:41.805 --> 24:44.285
They're fun, they've

24:41.805 --> 24:44.285
listened to the investors.

24:45.005 --> 24:46.405
<i>They wanted to know</i>

24:46.445 --> 24:49.565
<i>how they'd bring the Camino</i>

24:46.445 --> 24:49.565
<i>to life in a restaurant.</i>

24:49.605 --> 24:52.005
<i>Pilgrim's answer, a set menu,</i>

24:52.045 --> 24:54.005
<i>with each of the five courses</i>

24:54.045 --> 24:58.525
<i>representing a stop</i>

24:54.045 --> 24:58.525
<i>on the 500-mile pilgrimage.</i>

24:58.565 --> 25:01.005
[Jamie]<i> Probably isn't</i>

24:58.565 --> 25:01.005
<i>the most sensible thing to do</i>

25:01.045 --> 25:04.005
in a kitchen you don't know,

25:01.045 --> 25:04.005
but you know,

25:04.045 --> 25:05.405
I've got full confidence

25:04.045 --> 25:05.405
in Dave.

25:05.445 --> 25:08.085
He's a great chef.

25:05.445 --> 25:08.085
He can pull it off.

25:08.125 --> 25:10.765
[Fred]<i> The Pilgrim boys</i>

25:08.125 --> 25:10.765
<i>have a set menu tonight.</i>

25:10.805 --> 25:12.765
The idea came

25:10.805 --> 25:12.765
from France in the '70s.

25:12.805 --> 25:14.085
Of course.

25:14.125 --> 25:16.925
It was dreamt up

25:14.125 --> 25:16.925
by big-name French chefs

25:16.965 --> 25:19.845
to show what

25:16.965 --> 25:19.845
they were capable of.

25:16.965 --> 25:19.845
<i>Vive la France!</i>

25:19.885 --> 25:23.685
<i>Pilgrim's set menu</i>

25:19.885 --> 25:23.685
<i>will cost Â£38.</i>

25:23.725 --> 25:29.005
<i>Wine, specially paired</i>

25:23.725 --> 25:29.005
<i>for each course,</i>

25:23.725 --> 25:29.005
<i>is Â£28 extra.</i>

25:29.045 --> 25:32.485
<i>The shell is a sacred symbol</i>

25:29.045 --> 25:32.485
<i>of the pilgrimage.</i>

25:32.525 --> 25:35.845
<i>So the first dish for diners</i>

25:32.525 --> 25:35.845
<i>will be a butter-poached</i>

25:32.525 --> 25:35.845
<i>scallop.</i>

25:37.325 --> 25:39.045
<i>Next stop, Pamplona,</i>

25:39.085 --> 25:42.085
<i>and a vegan version</i>

25:39.085 --> 25:42.085
<i>of a local specialty,</i>

25:42.125 --> 25:45.605
<i>potato terrine</i>

25:42.125 --> 25:45.605
<i>on a lentil base.</i>

25:45.645 --> 25:50.005
<i>Third, a sherry-glazed quail</i>

25:45.645 --> 25:50.005
<i>with black pudding</i>

25:45.645 --> 25:50.005
<i>from Burgos.</i>

25:51.445 --> 25:54.365
<i>Wood-fired artichoke</i>

25:51.445 --> 25:54.365
<i>is the fourth stop.</i>

25:54.405 --> 25:58.605
<i>It's another vegan twist</i>

25:54.405 --> 25:58.605
<i>on a traditional dish</i>

25:54.405 --> 25:58.605
<i>from Leon.</i>

25:58.645 --> 26:02.205
<i>Dinner ends, like the walk,</i>

25:58.645 --> 26:02.205
<i>in Santiago de Compostela</i>

26:02.245 --> 26:06.045
<i>with a pudding in honor</i>

26:02.245 --> 26:06.045
<i>of Spain's patron saint.</i>

26:06.085 --> 26:09.845
This is the St. James Tart

26:06.085 --> 26:09.845
with a burnt-pear puree,

26:06.085 --> 26:09.845
candied hazelnuts.

26:09.885 --> 26:11.725
Olive oil-cured pear,

26:11.765 --> 26:14.765
and then we're just going

26:11.765 --> 26:14.765
to finish this

26:11.765 --> 26:14.765
with milk ice cream.

26:14.805 --> 26:16.365
Looking good, man.

26:20.485 --> 26:23.565
[Fred]<i> Two weeks</i>

26:20.485 --> 26:23.565
<i>after the investors</i>

26:20.485 --> 26:23.565
<i>tasted Pilgrim,</i>

26:23.605 --> 26:26.605
<i>they're in Manchester</i>

26:23.605 --> 26:26.605
<i>for a second bite.</i>

26:28.005 --> 26:29.365
<i>Over the next two days,</i>

26:29.405 --> 26:32.685
<i>they'll put Dave, Ant</i>

26:29.405 --> 26:32.685
<i>and Jamie's business plan,</i>

26:32.725 --> 26:35.885
<i>service and food</i>

26:32.725 --> 26:35.885
<i>to the test.</i>

26:35.925 --> 26:38.845
<i>Tomorrow evening,</i>

26:35.925 --> 26:38.845
<i>if they like what</i>

26:35.925 --> 26:38.845
<i>they've seen,</i>

26:38.885 --> 26:41.685
<i>there might even be</i>

26:38.885 --> 26:41.685
<i>a fight to invest.</i>

26:44.045 --> 26:46.325
<i>First to arrive</i>

26:44.045 --> 26:46.325
<i>is Darrel Connell,</i>

26:46.365 --> 26:49.525
<i>partner at investment firm</i>

26:46.365 --> 26:49.525
<i>Imbiba.</i>

26:49.565 --> 26:52.205
<i>They've invested</i>

26:49.565 --> 26:52.205
<i>over Â£60 million</i>

26:52.245 --> 26:54.925
<i>into new bars</i>

26:52.245 --> 26:54.925
<i>and restaurants.</i>

26:54.965 --> 26:57.325
[Connell]<i> I'm really</i>

26:54.965 --> 26:57.325
<i>looking forward to seeing</i>

26:57.365 --> 26:59.565
<i>how the proposition</i>

26:57.365 --> 26:59.565
<i>comes together.</i>

26:59.605 --> 27:01.405
They have this

26:59.605 --> 27:01.405
five-course tasting menu.

27:01.445 --> 27:05.285
That to me gives a presence

27:01.445 --> 27:05.285
of a higher-end offering.

27:05.325 --> 27:08.125
<i>That's a destination,</i>

27:05.325 --> 27:08.125
<i>that's an occasion restaurant.</i>

27:08.165 --> 27:09.765
<i>But from reading</i>

27:08.165 --> 27:09.765
<i>their business plan,</i>

27:09.805 --> 27:12.405
<i>I think the proposition</i>

27:09.805 --> 27:12.405
<i>lends itself more</i>

27:12.445 --> 27:15.445
to the affordable

27:12.445 --> 27:15.445
casual dining-type offering.

27:15.485 --> 27:19.565
<i>I'm really interested</i>

27:15.485 --> 27:19.565
<i>to see the offering</i>

27:15.485 --> 27:19.565
<i>in action tonight.</i>

27:19.605 --> 27:21.565
It's only then

27:19.605 --> 27:21.565
we can really work out

27:21.605 --> 27:23.245
what is this going to

27:21.605 --> 27:23.245
look like going forward.

27:27.845 --> 27:29.445
[Fred]<i> Next to arrive</i>

27:29.485 --> 27:33.085

27:29.485 --> 27:33.085
<i>and entrepreneur,</i>

27:29.485 --> 27:33.085
<i>Atul Kochhar.</i>

27:33.125 --> 27:34.885
[Kochhar]<i> As a chef,</i>

27:33.125 --> 27:34.885
<i>over the next two days,</i>

27:34.925 --> 27:36.445
<i>I need to be convinced</i>

27:34.925 --> 27:36.445
<i>on food.</i>

27:36.485 --> 27:37.685
What they had

27:36.485 --> 27:37.685
produced last time

27:37.725 --> 27:39.805
was very humble,

27:37.725 --> 27:39.805
very simple dish.

27:39.845 --> 27:41.245
But cooked

27:39.845 --> 27:41.245
to a really good level.

27:42.925 --> 27:44.205
<i>Tonight's a set menu.</i>

27:44.245 --> 27:47.525
<i>I am expecting three plates</i>

27:44.245 --> 27:47.525
<i>to be plant-based.</i>

27:47.565 --> 27:49.125
That's my kind of food.

27:47.565 --> 27:49.125
I love that sort of food.

27:49.925 --> 27:51.485
<i>It's a huge part of my ethos,</i>

27:51.525 --> 27:53.045
and if I'm totally convinced,

27:53.085 --> 27:55.405
then perhaps I could

27:53.085 --> 27:55.405
invest the money

27:53.085 --> 27:55.405
they are looking for.

27:58.045 --> 28:00.165
[Fred]<i> And finally,</i>

28:05.365 --> 28:08.765

28:08.805 --> 28:11.045
<i>to start a new bar</i>

28:08.805 --> 28:11.045
<i>or restaurant business.</i>

28:11.965 --> 28:13.365
I'm here as an investor

28:13.405 --> 28:15.245
because I want to get

28:13.405 --> 28:15.245
the best ideas

28:13.405 --> 28:15.245
up to Liverpool

28:15.285 --> 28:16.165

<i>a really good</i>

28:19.605 --> 28:22.445
<i>experiential brand here.</i>

28:22.485 --> 28:25.605
We have

28:22.485 --> 28:25.605
a 60-seater restaurant

28:22.485 --> 28:25.605
which is ready to go.

28:25.645 --> 28:28.685
<i>Pilgrim could be</i>

28:28.725 --> 28:31.845
<i>So that will be something</i>

28:28.725 --> 28:31.845
<i>I will be looking at</i>

28:28.725 --> 28:31.845
<i>in the next few days.</i>

28:35.525 --> 28:37.485
[Fred]<i> Pilgrim opens</i>

28:37.525 --> 28:42.285
<i>Tonight is its soft launch.</i>

28:42.325 --> 28:44.845
The customers will only

28:42.325 --> 28:44.845
be charged half-price

28:44.885 --> 28:47.805
as the team

28:44.885 --> 28:47.805
try to smooth out

28:44.885 --> 28:47.805
the rough edges.

28:47.845 --> 28:49.885
<i>The investors will be in too.</i>

28:49.925 --> 28:51.845
And they expect perfection.

28:54.125 --> 28:56.085
I need to calm down

28:54.125 --> 28:56.085
a little bit.

28:56.125 --> 28:58.325
[Ant] You're doing all right,

28:56.125 --> 28:58.325
mate. You're just nervous.

28:58.365 --> 29:01.005
It's good nervous.

28:58.365 --> 29:01.005
If you're not getting

28:58.365 --> 29:01.005
nervous for this,

29:01.045 --> 29:02.045
you must be dead.

29:02.085 --> 29:03.085
[laughs]

29:06.085 --> 29:08.485
[Fred]<i> Head chef Dave</i>

29:06.085 --> 29:08.485
<i>grew up in Liverpool.</i>

29:08.525 --> 29:12.125
<i>He's always dreamt</i>

29:08.525 --> 29:12.125
<i>of owning his own restaurant.</i>

29:12.165 --> 29:15.165
The chef-ing thing,

29:12.165 --> 29:15.165
it all started probably

29:12.165 --> 29:15.165
the age of ten,

29:15.205 --> 29:18.885
cooking at home,

29:15.205 --> 29:18.885
actually, with my sister.

29:18.925 --> 29:22.765
<i>Attempting double cheese</i>

29:18.925 --> 29:22.765
<i>souffles and so on.</i>

29:22.805 --> 29:24.205
So as soon as I

29:22.805 --> 29:24.205
finished school,

29:24.245 --> 29:26.245
<i>it was straight</i>

29:24.245 --> 29:26.245
<i>into the kitchen for me.</i>

29:26.285 --> 29:28.725
That's banging, dude,

29:26.285 --> 29:28.725
really good.

29:28.765 --> 29:30.645
What's exciting

29:28.765 --> 29:30.645
about Pilgrim, for me,

29:30.685 --> 29:34.925
it's the freedom

29:30.685 --> 29:34.925
with not being tied

29:30.685 --> 29:34.925
to someone else's vision

29:34.965 --> 29:36.405
of what they want you

29:34.965 --> 29:36.405
to be cooking.

29:37.765 --> 29:40.405
I can actually

29:37.765 --> 29:40.405
be creatively limitless,

29:37.765 --> 29:40.405
basically.

29:41.285 --> 29:43.445
<i>I know with the strong team</i>

29:43.485 --> 29:46.605
that I have... Pilgrim has

29:43.485 --> 29:46.605
the potential to succeed.

29:49.925 --> 29:52.205
[Dave] So, we've got

29:49.925 --> 29:52.205
five minutes left to go.

29:52.245 --> 29:53.365
[Jamie] All right, give us

29:52.245 --> 29:53.365
a little hug.

29:55.605 --> 29:57.565
[Fred]<i> Pilgrim</i>

29:55.605 --> 29:57.565
<i>are open for business.</i>

29:57.605 --> 30:00.485
<i>They've got 50 booked in</i>

29:57.605 --> 30:00.485
<i>for dinner.</i>

30:00.525 --> 30:01.685
First customers are in.

30:01.725 --> 30:02.605
-[Jamie] They're in, boys.

30:01.725 --> 30:02.605
-There we go.

30:04.085 --> 30:05.965
[Dan] Hi, good evening, guys.

30:04.085 --> 30:05.965
Would you like to follow me?

30:06.005 --> 30:08.725
[Fred]<i> Dave and Ant</i>

30:06.005 --> 30:08.725
<i>are behind the pass.</i>

30:08.765 --> 30:10.565
Yeah. We're just waiting

30:08.765 --> 30:10.565
for the first orders

30:08.765 --> 30:10.565
to get in.

30:10.605 --> 30:12.525
[Fred]<i> Jamie</i>

30:10.605 --> 30:12.525
<i>will run the floor.</i>

30:13.485 --> 30:14.885
[Jamie] If you look

30:13.485 --> 30:14.885
at your menu,

30:14.925 --> 30:17.365
the food is labeled

30:14.925 --> 30:17.365
and then we have

30:14.925 --> 30:17.365
a map next to it.

30:17.405 --> 30:19.965
So, we're going

30:17.405 --> 30:19.965
to have different courses

30:20.005 --> 30:22.205
all from different points

30:20.005 --> 30:22.205
along that route.

30:22.245 --> 30:26.325
[Fred]<i> And all</i>

30:22.245 --> 30:26.325
<i>customers will be served</i>

30:22.245 --> 30:26.325
<i>the same five dishes.</i>

30:26.365 --> 30:29.125
Glad they did

30:26.365 --> 30:29.125
they walking for us.

30:26.365 --> 30:29.125
[laughs]

30:29.165 --> 30:31.645
Oh, it's heaven.

30:29.165 --> 30:31.645
The set menu is heaven.

30:31.685 --> 30:33.165
It's like, don't have

30:31.685 --> 30:33.165
to think about what to order.

30:34.965 --> 30:35.925
Gotta tick on.

30:35.965 --> 30:37.485
Okay, two scallops

30:35.965 --> 30:37.485
now please.

30:37.525 --> 30:38.365
Two scallops,<i> oui</i> chef.

30:40.485 --> 30:42.245
We're just at the start

30:40.485 --> 30:42.245
of the journey at the moment.

30:42.285 --> 30:45.085
So just working our way

30:42.285 --> 30:45.085
through the beginning.

30:45.125 --> 30:46.845
[woman 1] It was lovely,

30:45.125 --> 30:46.845
the first course.

30:46.885 --> 30:48.245
-[woman 2] Really good.

30:46.885 --> 30:48.245
-[woman 1] Looking forward

30:46.885 --> 30:48.245
to the rest of it.

30:48.285 --> 30:50.365
Yeah, delicious.

30:48.285 --> 30:50.365
Really nice.

30:50.405 --> 30:53.405
You look out and see

30:50.405 --> 30:53.405
people just blown away

30:50.405 --> 30:53.405
by the food and the narrative

30:53.445 --> 30:55.165
<i>and that, I guess, as a chef,</i>

30:55.205 --> 30:57.125
is probably the best

30:55.205 --> 30:57.125
compliment you can have.

30:57.165 --> 30:58.725
Yes, chef!

30:58.765 --> 31:01.365
I love their menu.

30:58.765 --> 31:01.365
Presentation is everything.

31:01.405 --> 31:02.925
It's a passport,

31:01.405 --> 31:02.925
but what it does,

31:02.965 --> 31:04.285
it tells a story of the walk

31:04.325 --> 31:07.205
and the different towns

31:04.325 --> 31:07.205
that it's going through.

31:07.245 --> 31:09.445
Then at the back here,

31:07.245 --> 31:09.445
you got the stamps.

31:09.485 --> 31:12.725
Just like a passport

31:09.485 --> 31:12.725
where you go

31:09.485 --> 31:12.725
to different countries.

31:12.765 --> 31:15.325
It really is beautiful.

31:12.765 --> 31:15.325
I think they've captured

31:12.765 --> 31:15.325
their vision here.

31:15.365 --> 31:16.525
Service please.

31:18.605 --> 31:20.005
-[Dave] Service. Scallops.

31:18.605 --> 31:20.005
-[Dan] Yeah.

31:21.245 --> 31:22.765
Service.

31:22.805 --> 31:24.765
[Fred]<i> 6:30.</i>

31:22.805 --> 31:24.765
<i>Pilgrim's full,</i>

31:24.805 --> 31:27.525
<i>and everyone seems to be</i>

31:24.805 --> 31:27.525
<i>enjoying the set menu.</i>

31:28.885 --> 31:31.565
Table one, table two,

31:28.885 --> 31:31.565
table four...

31:31.605 --> 31:32.725
Is three covers.

31:33.685 --> 31:35.125
It should be four covers.

31:35.165 --> 31:37.685
[Fred]

31:35.165 --> 31:37.685
<i>But different tables</i>

31:35.165 --> 31:37.685
<i>are at different stages,</i>

31:37.725 --> 31:39.445
<i>so they're</i>

31:37.725 --> 31:39.445
<i>on different courses.</i>

31:40.365 --> 31:42.525
Fifteen, two quail.

31:42.565 --> 31:45.405
[Fred]<i> And the wait staff</i>

31:42.565 --> 31:45.405
<i>are losing track of orders.</i>

31:45.445 --> 31:46.885
-[Dave] On the pass.

31:45.445 --> 31:46.885
-Yes. Can I--

31:46.925 --> 31:48.405
It's gone,

31:46.925 --> 31:48.405
it's already gone.

31:48.445 --> 31:50.565
Table 15,

31:48.445 --> 31:50.565
two quail has gone.

31:50.605 --> 31:52.845
Table 15 doesn't have

31:50.605 --> 31:52.845
anything on the...

31:54.005 --> 31:56.765
-Sorry. Go, go, go.

31:54.005 --> 31:56.765
-Yeah.

31:56.805 --> 31:59.245
[Dave] It's making us

31:56.805 --> 31:59.245
look really bad.

31:59.285 --> 32:02.365
I'm starting to get grumpy,

31:59.285 --> 32:02.365
I need to stop it.

32:02.405 --> 32:04.165
[Fred] I'm here in the middle

32:02.405 --> 32:04.165
of the restaurant

32:04.205 --> 32:07.005
and I can't help to wonder,

32:04.205 --> 32:07.005
where is Jamie?

32:07.045 --> 32:09.045
<i>He should be</i>

32:07.045 --> 32:09.045
<i>managing the front of house,</i>

32:09.085 --> 32:11.925
<i>ensuring service</i>

32:09.085 --> 32:11.925
<i>runs smoothly.</i>

32:11.965 --> 32:13.245
There's one or two

32:11.965 --> 32:13.245
teething problems.

32:13.285 --> 32:15.605
I think there's numbers

32:13.285 --> 32:15.605
confused,

32:15.645 --> 32:18.725
and covers confused,

32:15.645 --> 32:18.725
and tables confused.

32:18.765 --> 32:20.045
[Jamie] That's white rioja,

32:18.765 --> 32:20.045
yeah.

32:20.085 --> 32:22.925
Jamie, sorry.

32:22.965 --> 32:24.525
-I love the atmosphere.

32:22.965 --> 32:24.525
-Yeah, yeah.

32:24.565 --> 32:26.285
I love the concept,

32:24.565 --> 32:26.285
it's very good.

32:26.325 --> 32:27.565
There's one thing

32:26.325 --> 32:27.565
I'm struggling with,

32:27.605 --> 32:29.525
you're not in the middle

32:27.605 --> 32:29.525
of the room.

32:29.565 --> 32:31.125
You need to be

32:29.565 --> 32:31.125
in the center of the room.

32:31.165 --> 32:33.405
Because this is your place,

32:31.165 --> 32:33.405
they need to see you.

32:33.445 --> 32:35.165
-Yeah, I appreciate

32:33.445 --> 32:35.165
what you're saying.

32:33.445 --> 32:35.165
-All right, see you in a bit.

32:36.925 --> 32:39.765
[Jamie] Let's pick it

32:36.925 --> 32:39.765
back up, shall we?

32:39.805 --> 32:41.925
Table seven,

32:39.805 --> 32:41.925
can you away course four?

32:41.965 --> 32:43.405
-[Ana] Yeah.

32:41.965 --> 32:43.405
-Thank you.

32:43.445 --> 32:44.925
The investors

32:43.445 --> 32:44.925
are about to come in

32:44.965 --> 32:46.965
and we've had these

32:44.965 --> 32:46.965
teething problems,

32:47.005 --> 32:48.885
but it seems to be

32:47.005 --> 32:48.885
leveling out now.

32:48.925 --> 32:50.725
Everyone seems to have

32:48.925 --> 32:50.725
found their rhythm

32:50.765 --> 32:53.045
so hopefully they'll walk in

32:50.765 --> 32:53.045
at just the right time.

32:54.525 --> 32:56.565
[Connell]<i> The most attractive</i>

32:54.525 --> 32:56.565
<i>thing about Pilgrim</i>

32:56.605 --> 32:58.605
<i>is the fact that there</i>

32:56.605 --> 32:58.605
<i>is a team of three.</i>

32:58.645 --> 33:01.885
<i>They cover different</i>

32:58.645 --> 33:01.885
<i>disciplines within</i>

32:58.645 --> 33:01.885
<i>the restaurant.</i>

33:01.925 --> 33:05.245
It's a much stronger base

33:01.925 --> 33:05.245
to run from

33:05.285 --> 33:08.285
than if it's a single-founder

33:05.285 --> 33:08.285
restaurant.

33:08.325 --> 33:09.485
[Farrell]<i> Tonight,</i>

33:08.325 --> 33:09.485
<i>there's a lot of pressure</i>

33:09.525 --> 33:11.485
but obviously the point

33:09.525 --> 33:11.485
of a soft launch

33:11.525 --> 33:13.845
is you iron out

33:11.525 --> 33:13.845
any discrepancies.

33:13.885 --> 33:17.245
<i>On top of that, they've got</i>

33:13.885 --> 33:17.245
<i>three investors there,</i>

33:17.285 --> 33:18.725
<i>they're open to the public.</i>

33:18.765 --> 33:20.245
The way they hold

33:18.765 --> 33:20.245
themselves tonight

33:20.285 --> 33:22.445
is going to be

33:20.285 --> 33:22.445
really important.

33:22.485 --> 33:25.005
[Kochhar]<i> I'm very excited</i>

33:22.485 --> 33:25.005
<i>about dinner tonight.</i>

33:25.045 --> 33:26.965
This is going to be

33:25.045 --> 33:26.965
somewhere in-between

33:27.005 --> 33:28.725
casual and Michelin-star

33:27.005 --> 33:28.725
restaurant.

33:28.765 --> 33:30.125
<i>There's a big market for that</i>

33:30.165 --> 33:33.005
because people want

33:30.165 --> 33:33.005
elevated experience,

33:33.045 --> 33:35.165
but not

33:33.045 --> 33:35.165
with the Michelin-star prices.

33:35.205 --> 33:36.805
[Dan] Hi, there,

33:35.205 --> 33:36.805
good evening.

33:35.205 --> 33:36.805
How are you?

33:36.845 --> 33:38.045
Good evening,

33:36.845 --> 33:38.045
we are good.

33:38.085 --> 33:39.885
If we come to a situation

33:39.925 --> 33:42.125
<i>that Pilgrim has got</i>

33:39.925 --> 33:42.125
<i>all three investors</i>

33:39.925 --> 33:42.125

33:42.165 --> 33:45.445

33:42.165 --> 33:45.445
an edge over Darrel and Matt.

33:45.485 --> 33:46.645
Can I have a name please?

33:46.685 --> 33:50.325
Atul, Darrel and Matt.

33:53.005 --> 33:54.805
[Dan] What time are you in for?

33:54.845 --> 33:56.405
-[Kochhar] Now.

33:54.845 --> 33:56.405
-Now?

33:58.765 --> 34:00.965
Don't have you on here,

33:58.765 --> 34:00.965
would it be under

33:58.765 --> 34:00.965
anything else?

34:01.005 --> 34:02.885
No. It would

34:01.005 --> 34:02.885
have to be us.

34:02.925 --> 34:05.205
-[laughs]

34:02.925 --> 34:05.205
-[Dan] Yeah, okay.

34:05.245 --> 34:06.365
Ah, you're the investors,

34:05.245 --> 34:06.365
aren't you?

34:06.405 --> 34:08.765
There we go. I thought you

34:06.405 --> 34:08.765
were the investors.

34:08.805 --> 34:10.365
Trying to trick me,

34:08.805 --> 34:10.365
aren't you?

34:10.405 --> 34:12.045
No worries, do you want

34:10.405 --> 34:12.045
to follow me through?

34:16.045 --> 34:18.165
I've got to say,

34:16.045 --> 34:18.165
I am really impressed by this.

34:18.205 --> 34:20.165
Big question for me

34:18.205 --> 34:20.165
coming into this,

34:20.205 --> 34:22.365
how are they going to hang

34:20.205 --> 34:22.365
the whole Camino vibe

34:22.405 --> 34:24.525
around this restaurant?

34:22.405 --> 34:24.525
It's actually quite clever.

34:25.925 --> 34:27.645
No, it's a good vibe in here.

34:27.685 --> 34:29.365
[Kochhar] People seem happy.

34:29.405 --> 34:31.525
Yeah, its good. Relaxed.

34:31.565 --> 34:33.445
All right, guys,

34:31.565 --> 34:33.445
how you doing?

34:33.485 --> 34:34.765
Nice to see you again.

34:33.485 --> 34:34.765
Are you well?

34:34.805 --> 34:36.805
-[Jamie] Yeah, very well. You?

34:34.805 --> 34:36.805
-Good to see you.

34:36.845 --> 34:38.765
I would recommend

34:36.845 --> 34:38.765
the beverage pairing.

34:38.805 --> 34:40.645
There's some really

34:38.805 --> 34:40.645
beautiful wines on there,

34:40.685 --> 34:41.845
some nice vermouths.

34:41.885 --> 34:43.005
We're in your hands.

34:44.125 --> 34:46.885
[Dave] Table nine,

34:44.125 --> 34:46.885
three scallops, VIP. Yes?

34:46.925 --> 34:49.125
Three scallops VIP,

34:46.925 --> 34:49.125
<i>oui</i> chef.

34:49.165 --> 34:52.285
There's a lot riding on this

34:49.165 --> 34:52.285
but it's a lot of fun...

34:53.405 --> 34:54.485
at the moment.

34:55.885 --> 34:58.645
This is your scallop

34:55.885 --> 34:58.645
with Jerusalem artichoke puree

34:58.685 --> 35:00.165
and girolle mushrooms as well.

35:09.485 --> 35:11.205
Wow, it's very nice.

35:12.765 --> 35:14.165
Scallop is cooked

35:12.765 --> 35:14.165
beautifully, isn't it?

35:14.205 --> 35:15.045
It is.

35:17.125 --> 35:18.765
[Jamie] How we getting

35:17.125 --> 35:18.765

35:18.805 --> 35:19.685
Delicious.

35:19.725 --> 35:20.845
-Right. Cheers.

This is a potato terrine.

35:30.005 --> 35:33.325
There we are. And I'll get

35:30.005 --> 35:33.325
the drinks for you as well,

35:30.005 --> 35:33.325
chaps.

35:33.365 --> 35:36.765
They said in their pitch

35:33.365 --> 35:36.765
that they are going to be

35:33.365 --> 35:36.765
70% plant-based.

35:36.805 --> 35:39.645
<i>That excites me a lot</i>

35:36.805 --> 35:39.645
<i>because that's</i>

35:36.805 --> 35:39.645
<i>my kind of food.</i>

35:50.685 --> 35:52.565
For me, that's

35:50.685 --> 35:52.565
a bit disappointing.

35:53.565 --> 35:54.565
Yeah, I agree.

35:56.605 --> 35:58.285
[Kochhar] It's a struggle,

35:56.605 --> 35:58.285
this dish.

35:58.325 --> 36:03.325
I find lentils quite boring

35:58.325 --> 36:03.325
and there is no flavor

35:58.325 --> 36:03.325
in potato as such.

36:06.085 --> 36:07.085
[Jamie] Are you guys

36:06.085 --> 36:07.085
done here?

36:07.125 --> 36:08.245
-Yeah.

36:07.125 --> 36:08.245
-[Farrell] Yeah, thanks.

36:12.525 --> 36:13.725
[Jamie]<i> Yeah, I'd like</i>

36:12.525 --> 36:13.725
<i>to see a clean plate.</i>

36:13.765 --> 36:15.285
It's always nice

36:13.765 --> 36:15.285
to see clean plates.

36:15.325 --> 36:17.245
Hopefully they would

36:15.325 --> 36:17.245
have said something

36:17.285 --> 36:18.565
if they hadn't enjoyed it.

36:18.605 --> 36:21.605
So, yeah, hopefully

36:18.605 --> 36:21.605
just saving room.

36:28.165 --> 36:31.325
It's too rigid for me.

36:28.165 --> 36:31.325
The tasting menu

36:28.165 --> 36:31.325
doesn't work.

36:31.365 --> 36:33.845
No. People need

36:31.365 --> 36:33.845
to have the choice.

36:33.885 --> 36:36.205
[Connell] When you go

36:33.885 --> 36:36.205
to a tasting-menu restaurant,

36:36.245 --> 36:37.805
it's a completely

36:36.245 --> 36:37.805
different thing

36:37.845 --> 36:39.405
to going to a restaurant

36:37.845 --> 36:39.405
where you can drop in,

36:39.445 --> 36:41.245
have a couple of dishes.

36:41.285 --> 36:43.725
If Pilgrim had flexibility

36:41.285 --> 36:43.725
in the menu,

36:43.765 --> 36:45.645
<i>you typically look</i>

36:43.765 --> 36:45.645
<i>around a price point</i>

36:45.685 --> 36:48.205
<i>of between Â£35</i>

36:45.685 --> 36:48.205
<i>and Â£45 a head,</i>

36:48.245 --> 36:50.205
which people are happy

36:48.245 --> 36:50.205
to engage in

36:50.245 --> 36:52.045
maybe once or twice a week.

36:52.085 --> 36:54.965
<i>I think the minute</i>

36:52.085 --> 36:54.965
<i>you're confined by their</i>

36:52.085 --> 36:54.965
<i>five-course tasting menu,</i>

36:55.005 --> 36:57.045
it really then becomes

36:55.005 --> 36:57.045
an occasion restaurant.

36:57.085 --> 36:58.845
[Jamie] How we going?

36:58.885 --> 37:02.845
So, is the idea that

36:58.885 --> 37:02.845
it will always be

36:58.885 --> 37:02.845
five-course tasting?

37:02.885 --> 37:04.405
I don't know

37:02.885 --> 37:04.405
whether it's too rigid.

37:04.445 --> 37:05.885
Yeah, yeah.

37:04.445 --> 37:05.885
So, we're always

37:04.445 --> 37:05.885
going to have

37:05.925 --> 37:07.405
the tasting menu

37:05.925 --> 37:07.405
as part of it.

37:07.445 --> 37:08.925
Like, we're very aware

37:07.445 --> 37:08.925
of the fact

37:08.965 --> 37:11.565
that this is not something

37:08.965 --> 37:11.565
you can go and eat

37:08.965 --> 37:11.565
every night,

37:11.605 --> 37:12.885
you know what I mean?

37:12.925 --> 37:14.445
It's really just

37:12.925 --> 37:14.445
to demonstrate

37:12.925 --> 37:14.445
what we would do.

37:14.485 --> 37:15.325
Thanks.

37:17.485 --> 37:19.645
Four quail ready.

37:17.485 --> 37:19.645
Two quail ready.

37:19.685 --> 37:21.685
Right, I want two

37:19.685 --> 37:21.685
and then we'll go four.

37:21.725 --> 37:22.565
Yes, chef.

37:23.725 --> 37:24.885
How are you, guys?

37:24.925 --> 37:26.005
Good, how are you?

37:26.045 --> 37:27.365
-Very good, thank you.

37:26.045 --> 37:27.365
-Good, good.

37:28.325 --> 37:29.565
How is it going?

37:29.605 --> 37:31.565
The guys are completely

37:29.605 --> 37:31.565
in control of this place.

37:31.605 --> 37:34.845
They know, as a team,

37:31.605 --> 37:34.845
how to run a restaurant.

37:34.885 --> 37:36.205
There's no question

37:34.885 --> 37:36.205
about that.

37:36.245 --> 37:39.365
But I feel like I'm in a...

37:39.405 --> 37:42.445
casual, relaxed

37:39.405 --> 37:42.445
restaurant environment,

37:42.485 --> 37:44.645
but I'm feeling like

37:42.485 --> 37:44.645
the menu is a bit

37:42.485 --> 37:44.645
fine dining.

37:44.685 --> 37:46.565
-So, I'm a bit confused.

37:44.685 --> 37:46.565
-Right.

37:46.605 --> 37:47.685
The way they have

37:46.605 --> 37:47.685
laid this out,

37:47.725 --> 37:49.765
I would come here

37:47.725 --> 37:49.765
for my wife's birthday.

37:49.805 --> 37:52.005
You should come to my place

37:49.805 --> 37:52.005
for your wife's birthday.

37:52.045 --> 37:53.525
[all laughing]

38:00.485 --> 38:04.285
[Fred]<i> The first</i>

38:00.485 --> 38:04.285
<i>of Pilgrim's two services</i>

38:00.485 --> 38:04.285
<i>is almost over.</i>

38:04.325 --> 38:06.045
All right, well, I'm glad

38:04.325 --> 38:06.045
you enjoyed it.

38:06.085 --> 38:08.645
Cheers, thanks.

38:06.085 --> 38:08.645
Thank you very much.

38:08.685 --> 38:10.085
[Fred]<i> And there</i>

38:08.685 --> 38:10.085
<i>are questions</i>

38:10.125 --> 38:12.245
<i>over the style</i>

38:10.125 --> 38:12.245
<i>of the restaurant.</i>

38:12.285 --> 38:14.445
[Connell]<i> The guys did</i>

38:12.285 --> 38:14.445
<i>an amazing job.</i>

38:14.485 --> 38:17.365
First night, you know,

38:14.485 --> 38:17.365
they're full of anxiety.

38:17.405 --> 38:18.325
There was none of that

38:17.405 --> 38:18.325
that came through.

38:18.365 --> 38:20.045
<i>But, all that said,</i>

38:20.085 --> 38:22.925
<i>they've pinned their mast</i>

38:20.085 --> 38:22.925
<i>to this Camino journey</i>

38:22.965 --> 38:25.445
and it came across

38:22.965 --> 38:25.445
in quite a rigid way.

38:25.485 --> 38:27.845
<i>They've presented</i>

38:25.485 --> 38:27.845
<i>a five-course tasting menu.</i>

38:27.885 --> 38:29.965
<i>There's no element</i>

38:27.885 --> 38:29.965
<i>of selection,</i>

38:30.005 --> 38:32.605
<i>and for a consumer,</i>

38:30.005 --> 38:32.605
<i>that's a Â£70 evening.</i>

38:32.645 --> 38:34.005
My big question

38:32.645 --> 38:34.005
for them tomorrow is

38:34.045 --> 38:36.485
can that be done

38:34.045 --> 38:36.485
in a much more

38:34.045 --> 38:36.485
flexible format?

38:36.525 --> 38:38.325
[Jamie] Good work, man.

38:36.525 --> 38:38.325
Good work.

38:38.365 --> 38:40.805
[Kochhar]

38:38.365 --> 38:40.805
<i>They are a formidable team.</i>

38:38.365 --> 38:40.805
<i>I have confidence in that.</i>

38:40.845 --> 38:44.485
But they have mentioned

38:40.845 --> 38:44.485
that they would want to be

38:40.845 --> 38:44.485
70% plant-based food.

38:44.525 --> 38:48.365
<i>The potato was,</i>

38:44.525 --> 38:48.365
<i>quite frankly, disappointing.</i>

38:48.405 --> 38:50.085
It's a humble potato,

38:48.405 --> 38:50.085
I get it.

38:50.125 --> 38:52.005
But it needs to be great

38:50.125 --> 38:52.005
if I'm paying for it.

38:52.045 --> 38:53.205
[Jamie] Thank you

38:52.045 --> 38:53.205
very much, man.

38:53.245 --> 38:54.925
-Thank you. Cheers.

38:53.245 --> 38:54.925
-Cheers.

38:54.965 --> 38:56.765
I thought as a team

38:54.965 --> 38:56.765
they were really impressive.

38:56.805 --> 38:59.525
<i>The only issue I do have</i>

38:56.805 --> 38:59.525
<i>is just that the menu</i>

38:56.805 --> 38:59.525
<i>is a little bit rigid.</i>

38:59.565 --> 39:02.725
And potentially didn't

38:59.565 --> 39:02.725
match what was going on

38:59.565 --> 39:02.725
in the restaurant.

39:02.765 --> 39:05.405
<i>Restaurants are all about</i>

39:02.765 --> 39:05.405
<i>repeat custom, repeat guests.</i>

39:05.445 --> 39:07.205
<i>You're not going to get</i>

39:05.445 --> 39:07.205
<i>that with a set menu.</i>

39:07.245 --> 39:09.645
I just want to know

39:07.245 --> 39:09.645
whether they're going to be

39:07.245 --> 39:09.645
open to changing that.

39:09.685 --> 39:11.725
[Dave] Nice service,

39:09.685 --> 39:11.725
thanks for dealing

39:09.685 --> 39:11.725
with my stress.

39:11.765 --> 39:12.645
[Jamie] Thank you. Thank you.

39:21.365 --> 39:25.805
[Fred]<i> It's Pilgrim's</i>

39:21.365 --> 39:25.805
<i>final day, and they're</i>

39:21.365 --> 39:25.805
<i>going to be busy.</i>

39:25.845 --> 39:28.245
First, they've got

39:25.845 --> 39:28.245
a business meeting

39:25.845 --> 39:28.245
with the investors,

39:28.285 --> 39:31.205
then a full-price

39:28.285 --> 39:31.205
lunch service.

39:31.245 --> 39:34.245
And then, and only then,

39:31.245 --> 39:34.245
if they reach the summit,

39:34.285 --> 39:37.365
might they get that Â£400,000

39:34.285 --> 39:37.365
they were asking for.

39:38.765 --> 39:41.765
[Fred]<i> But before that,</i>

39:38.765 --> 39:41.765
<i>Atul wants to talk.</i>

39:44.445 --> 39:46.245
-Morning, Atul.

39:44.445 --> 39:46.245
-Morning, Fred, how are you?

39:46.285 --> 39:48.285
I'm very well, thank you.

39:46.285 --> 39:48.285
Very, very well.

39:48.325 --> 39:50.125
So, what are you

39:48.325 --> 39:50.125
thinking about Pilgrim?

39:50.165 --> 39:53.125
You know, Fred,

39:50.165 --> 39:53.125
while going through

39:50.165 --> 39:53.125
their executive summary,

39:53.165 --> 39:55.965
in the heart

39:53.165 --> 39:55.965
of their offering,

39:56.005 --> 39:59.485
this is where they say,

39:56.005 --> 39:59.485
"70% plant-based dishes."

39:59.525 --> 40:01.805
Yesterday when I had

39:59.525 --> 40:01.805
dinner with them,

40:01.845 --> 40:03.725
their vegetable offering

40:01.845 --> 40:03.725
wasn't great.

40:04.565 --> 40:05.925
That's a major problem.

40:05.965 --> 40:07.805
What you're saying,

40:05.965 --> 40:07.805
you're not delivering.

40:07.845 --> 40:09.285
[Fred] Is this a deal-breaker

40:07.845 --> 40:09.285
for you?

40:09.325 --> 40:11.005
It's a major

40:09.325 --> 40:11.005
deal-breaker for me.

40:11.045 --> 40:13.485
I can't be part

40:11.045 --> 40:13.485
of this deal.

40:13.525 --> 40:17.205
Okay. All right, well,

40:13.525 --> 40:17.205
they still have two investors

40:13.525 --> 40:17.205
who are interested.

40:17.245 --> 40:19.005
Hopefully, it will

40:17.245 --> 40:19.005
work out for them.

40:19.045 --> 40:21.445
I do hope so.

40:19.045 --> 40:21.445
They are great guys,

40:19.045 --> 40:21.445
and good luck to them.

40:21.485 --> 40:23.085
Okay, thank you

40:21.485 --> 40:23.085
very much, Atul.

40:23.125 --> 40:24.605
-Have a very good day.

40:23.125 --> 40:24.605
See you later. Thank you.

40:23.125 --> 40:24.605
-Thank you, Fred.

40:27.045 --> 40:30.445
[Fred]<i> 8:00 a.m.</i>

40:27.045 --> 40:30.445
<i>The boys are back</i>

40:27.045 --> 40:30.445
<i>in the restaurant.</i>

40:30.485 --> 40:34.685
<i>And after the investors'</i>

40:30.485 --> 40:34.685
<i>concerns last night</i>

40:30.485 --> 40:34.685
<i>about the set menu,</i>

40:34.725 --> 40:39.045
<i>they are considering</i>

40:34.725 --> 40:39.045
<i>a bold change</i>

40:34.725 --> 40:39.045
<i>to their lunch service.</i>

40:39.085 --> 40:41.525
We've got to talk

40:39.085 --> 40:41.525
about the investors

40:41.565 --> 40:44.645
and what they're

40:41.565 --> 40:44.645
looking for from us.

40:44.685 --> 40:47.165
I mean, I know we had

40:44.685 --> 40:47.165
a little chat about

40:47.205 --> 40:48.885
maybe going a la carte.

40:48.925 --> 40:50.685
Exactly. I think it's just

40:48.925 --> 40:50.685
something that we can

40:48.925 --> 40:50.685
show the investors

40:50.725 --> 40:52.605
the diversity

40:50.725 --> 40:52.605
of what we can do

40:52.645 --> 40:55.085
and especially

40:52.645 --> 40:55.085
in a short turnaround.

40:55.125 --> 40:57.925
How creative Pilgrim's

40:55.125 --> 40:57.925
menus can be.

40:57.965 --> 40:59.405
[Fred]

40:57.965 --> 40:59.405
<i>This is clever stuff.</i>

40:59.445 --> 41:01.605
<i>Pilgrim will show</i>

40:59.445 --> 41:01.605
<i>they're flexible</i>

41:01.645 --> 41:03.645
<i>if they can give</i>

41:01.645 --> 41:03.645
<i>customers choice</i>

41:03.685 --> 41:05.365
<i>from an a la carte menu.</i>

41:05.405 --> 41:09.085
<i>But first I have to give</i>

41:05.405 --> 41:09.085
<i>them Atul's news.</i>

41:09.125 --> 41:10.565
-[Fred]<i> How are you?</i>

41:09.125 --> 41:10.565
-[man]<i> Good morning.</i>

41:10.605 --> 41:12.605
[Fred]<i> How are you doing?</i>

41:10.605 --> 41:12.605
<i>Are you rested?</i>

41:12.645 --> 41:14.845
-Rested, yeah.

41:12.645 --> 41:14.845
-As good as can be.

41:14.885 --> 41:16.005
I mean, yesterday

41:14.885 --> 41:16.005
was a big day.

41:16.045 --> 41:19.125
Yeah, it was a lot.

41:19.165 --> 41:21.805
[Fred] I've got some

41:19.165 --> 41:21.805
bad news today.

41:21.845 --> 41:23.325
Atul has pulled out.

41:24.125 --> 41:26.725
-Okay

41:24.125 --> 41:26.725
-All right.

41:26.765 --> 41:30.125
Did he give any reason

41:26.765 --> 41:30.125
for that or just wasn't

41:26.765 --> 41:30.125
interested?

41:30.165 --> 41:32.845
He wasn't satisfied

41:30.165 --> 41:32.845
with the quality

41:30.165 --> 41:32.845
of the plant-based dishes.

41:34.845 --> 41:37.205
He's talking about

41:34.845 --> 41:37.205
the potatoes

41:34.845 --> 41:37.205
and the artichoke.

41:37.245 --> 41:38.405
That's his feedback.

41:38.445 --> 41:41.285
Yep. Right.

41:41.325 --> 41:44.805
You still have

41:41.325 --> 41:44.805
two other investors

41:41.325 --> 41:44.805
who are interested.

41:44.845 --> 41:46.245
You're going to have

41:44.845 --> 41:46.245
two business meetings

41:46.285 --> 41:47.485
within the next hour now.

41:47.525 --> 41:49.845
How you feel today

41:47.525 --> 41:49.845
about the meeting, Anthony?

41:49.885 --> 41:51.045
[Ant] Yeah, I really want

41:49.885 --> 41:51.045
to hear their feedback,

41:51.085 --> 41:52.765
what they've got to say

41:52.805 --> 41:55.285
and hopefully answer

41:52.805 --> 41:55.285
any questions they've got.

41:55.325 --> 41:59.565
Good luck. By tonight,

41:55.325 --> 41:59.565
you could well be offered

41:55.325 --> 41:59.565
two investments.

41:59.605 --> 42:01.525
I wish you the best.

41:59.605 --> 42:01.525
See you later.

42:01.565 --> 42:02.445
-Thank you.

42:01.565 --> 42:02.445
-Cheers, Fred.

42:02.485 --> 42:03.765
Take care. See you later.

42:07.445 --> 42:08.525
[Ant] Shame about Atul.

42:08.565 --> 42:11.405
It is a shame about Atul.

42:08.565 --> 42:11.405
Still two, though.

42:11.445 --> 42:12.565
Yeah, well...

42:12.605 --> 42:14.005
Still two big players.

42:16.565 --> 42:18.525
[Fred]<i> Pilgrim</i>

42:16.565 --> 42:18.525
<i>now face private meetings</i>

42:18.565 --> 42:23.125
<i>with the investors</i>

42:18.565 --> 42:23.125
<i>to interrogate</i>

42:18.565 --> 42:23.125
<i>their business plan.</i>

42:23.165 --> 42:26.525
<i>As Matt and Darrel</i>

42:23.165 --> 42:26.525
<i>are in competition</i>

42:23.165 --> 42:26.525
<i>with each other,</i>

42:26.565 --> 42:30.685
<i>they'll each have</i>

42:26.565 --> 42:30.685
<i>an hour alone with Jamie,</i>

42:26.565 --> 42:30.685
<i>Dave and Ant.</i>

42:30.725 --> 42:32.845
[Connell]

42:30.725 --> 42:32.845
<i>Pilgrim are looking for</i>

42:30.725 --> 42:32.845
<i>Â£400,000 investment.</i>

42:32.885 --> 42:35.125
<i>That feels to me about right.</i>

42:35.165 --> 42:36.565
We would absolutely

42:35.165 --> 42:36.565
be interested

42:36.605 --> 42:38.765
if it could get

42:36.605 --> 42:38.765
up to a three, four

42:36.605 --> 42:38.765
site operation.

42:38.805 --> 42:42.525
<i>But if the guys want</i>

42:38.805 --> 42:42.525
<i>to go down the route</i>

42:38.805 --> 42:42.525
<i>of the high-end offering,</i>

42:42.565 --> 42:44.085
it's probably not as scalable

42:44.125 --> 42:48.245
as if it was a more

42:44.125 --> 42:48.245
affordable, casual

42:44.125 --> 42:48.245
dining-type offering.

42:48.285 --> 42:50.725
[Farrell]<i> I think</i>

42:48.285 --> 42:50.725
<i>if I was ever going</i>

42:48.285 --> 42:50.725
<i>to invest in something,</i>

42:50.765 --> 42:52.165
<i>I have to believe</i>

42:50.765 --> 42:52.165
<i>in the people.</i>

42:52.205 --> 42:53.285
And want to work with them.

42:53.325 --> 42:54.805
<i>They've come across</i>

42:53.325 --> 42:54.805
<i>very modest,</i>

42:54.845 --> 42:56.605
<i>and that for me is important.</i>

42:56.645 --> 42:58.485
Like any relationship,

42:56.645 --> 42:58.485
it needs to grow.

42:58.525 --> 43:02.085
[Fred]<i> If Pilgrim</i>

42:58.525 --> 43:02.085
<i>don't impress in this</i>

42:58.525 --> 43:02.085
<i>morning's meetings,</i>

43:02.125 --> 43:04.525
<i>the investors could walk away.</i>

43:04.565 --> 43:06.285
-All right, chaps.

43:04.565 --> 43:06.285
-Hi, there. How you doing?

43:06.325 --> 43:07.405
-Good to see you again.

43:07.445 --> 43:08.485
-Yeah.

43:07.445 --> 43:08.485
-Good morning.

43:08.525 --> 43:10.165
[Jamie] Yeah, morning, morning.

43:10.205 --> 43:11.565
I think the first thing

43:10.205 --> 43:11.565
to say is,

43:11.605 --> 43:13.845
we see many, many hundreds

43:11.605 --> 43:13.845
of business plans every year,

43:13.885 --> 43:15.645
and this is really well

43:13.885 --> 43:15.645
put together.

43:15.685 --> 43:18.285
There was a little bit

43:15.685 --> 43:18.285
of confusion last night about

43:18.325 --> 43:21.565
what is the occasion

43:18.325 --> 43:21.565
and the price point

43:18.325 --> 43:21.565
of Pilgrim?

43:21.605 --> 43:22.765
What are you trying to be?

43:22.805 --> 43:24.565
[Jamie] The way we've

43:22.805 --> 43:24.565
sort of seen it is that

43:24.605 --> 43:26.365
Thursday, Friday,

43:24.605 --> 43:26.365
Saturdays in the restaurant,

43:26.405 --> 43:28.445
it would be the tasting menu.

43:28.485 --> 43:30.445
But then the rest

43:28.485 --> 43:30.445
of the time, you've got a bar.

43:30.485 --> 43:33.285
And that's more geared

43:30.485 --> 43:33.285
towards small sharing plates.

43:33.325 --> 43:35.925
A glass of wine,

43:33.325 --> 43:35.925
a bit more casual,

43:33.325 --> 43:35.925
a bit more relaxed

43:35.965 --> 43:38.765
and bringing that

43:35.965 --> 43:38.765
spend per head down.

43:38.805 --> 43:41.325
The bulk of your revenues

43:38.805 --> 43:41.325
are likely to be

43:38.805 --> 43:41.325
in the evening.

43:41.365 --> 43:42.805
You know,

43:41.365 --> 43:42.805
from the five-course

43:41.365 --> 43:42.805
tasting menu.

43:42.845 --> 43:44.365
-Is that fair to say?

43:42.845 --> 43:44.365
-I think so.

43:46.005 --> 43:48.325
Look, there are many

43:46.005 --> 43:48.325
successful businesses

43:46.005 --> 43:48.325
out there

43:48.365 --> 43:50.165
that have tasting menus.

43:50.205 --> 43:52.445
<i>The thing I'm struggling</i>

43:50.205 --> 43:52.445
<i>a little bit with is,</i>

43:52.485 --> 43:54.365
they're laid-back guys,

43:52.485 --> 43:54.365
they're really nice guys.

43:54.405 --> 43:56.725
They're so social,

43:54.405 --> 43:56.725
and I'm not sure

43:56.765 --> 43:59.805
that the kind of more

43:56.765 --> 43:59.805
formal, high-end

43:56.765 --> 43:59.805
tasting menu kind of

43:59.845 --> 44:01.805
lends itself

43:59.845 --> 44:01.805
to their approach

44:01.845 --> 44:03.005
<i>and their ethos</i>

44:01.845 --> 44:03.005
<i>and their culture.</i>

44:03.045 --> 44:05.325
Can we talk a bit

44:03.045 --> 44:05.325
about the numbers?

44:05.365 --> 44:08.925
Eighty grand for rent,

44:05.365 --> 44:08.925
which I think is probably

44:05.365 --> 44:08.925
about right.

44:08.965 --> 44:11.285
You're targeting

44:08.965 --> 44:11.285
net profit of 155,

44:11.325 --> 44:12.685
does that include salaries

44:11.325 --> 44:12.685
for you guys?

44:12.725 --> 44:14.805
We... Our salaries

44:12.725 --> 44:14.805
are written into that.

44:14.845 --> 44:17.325
I think because we intend

44:14.845 --> 44:17.325
to be so hands-on,

44:17.365 --> 44:19.525
in terms of what

44:17.365 --> 44:19.525
we're taking out of it,

44:19.565 --> 44:20.445
we're taking very little.

44:20.485 --> 44:21.445
So, what is it?

44:21.485 --> 44:24.125
-What, the--

44:21.485 --> 44:24.125
-The salary?

44:24.165 --> 44:26.645
So, we want to start

44:24.165 --> 44:26.645
ourselves on about 40,000.

44:26.685 --> 44:28.085
-Each?

44:26.685 --> 44:28.085
-Each, yeah.

44:28.125 --> 44:30.565
120k, it's quite

44:28.125 --> 44:30.565
a lot of money

44:30.605 --> 44:32.125
to take out of a business

44:30.605 --> 44:32.125
on a first year.

44:32.165 --> 44:34.965
And I think this is the issue

44:32.165 --> 44:34.965
they might have. The fact...

44:35.005 --> 44:36.605
<i>Okay, great,</i>

44:35.005 --> 44:36.605
<i>there's three of them</i>

44:36.645 --> 44:39.565
<i>but then that also</i>

44:36.645 --> 44:39.565
<i>has a problem,</i>

44:36.645 --> 44:39.565
<i>looking at the numbers.</i>

44:45.165 --> 44:47.885
What I do want to see,

44:45.165 --> 44:47.885
especially at lunch, is that

44:47.925 --> 44:50.365
you are able

44:47.925 --> 44:50.365
to diversify away

44:50.405 --> 44:53.765
from the rigid sort of

44:50.405 --> 44:53.765
fine-dining aspect of it.

44:53.805 --> 44:55.445
When we first

44:53.805 --> 44:55.445
saw the business plan,

44:55.485 --> 44:58.885
it was very much about

44:55.485 --> 44:58.885
Pilgrim being a sharing plate

44:55.485 --> 44:58.885
experience.

44:58.925 --> 45:01.725
Is today's menu,

44:58.925 --> 45:01.725
is there going to be

44:58.925 --> 45:01.725
a sharing element to it?

45:01.765 --> 45:05.005
So, the menu will be

45:01.765 --> 45:05.005
the same dishes

45:01.765 --> 45:05.005
as last night,

45:05.045 --> 45:07.845
but small plates

45:05.045 --> 45:07.845
and the a la carte service.

45:07.885 --> 45:09.445
And there will be

45:07.885 --> 45:09.445
a sharing element to it.

45:09.485 --> 45:11.045
No one's sharing

45:09.485 --> 45:11.045
my scallop, though.

45:11.085 --> 45:13.685
[all laughing]

45:13.725 --> 45:15.405
[Dave] And we'll get

45:13.725 --> 45:15.405
a little special on.

45:15.445 --> 45:17.205
-I'll keep it

45:15.445 --> 45:17.205
as a surprise for now.

45:15.445 --> 45:17.205
-[Farrell] Okay.

45:18.765 --> 45:20.725
[Farrell]<i> I think</i>

45:18.765 --> 45:20.725
<i>at the moment, it's 50/50.</i>

45:20.765 --> 45:23.045
I think they have

45:20.765 --> 45:23.045
to be open to change.

45:23.085 --> 45:25.565
And that's something

45:23.085 --> 45:25.565
that I'm only gonna get

45:25.605 --> 45:26.885
<i>from seeing them</i>

45:25.605 --> 45:26.885
<i>a little bit more,</i>

45:26.925 --> 45:28.205
<i>seeing them at lunch,</i>

45:28.245 --> 45:31.405
and maybe that'll help me

45:28.245 --> 45:31.405
to be clear on a decision.

45:33.205 --> 45:34.685
[Fred]<i> At the end</i>

45:33.205 --> 45:34.685
<i>of the meetings,</i>

45:34.725 --> 45:37.645
<i>the investors can spell out</i>

45:34.725 --> 45:37.645
<i>the offers they'll make,</i>

45:37.685 --> 45:41.885
<i>if, and only if, they decide</i>

45:37.685 --> 45:41.885
<i>to invest tonight.</i>

45:41.925 --> 45:44.245
So, in terms of our offer,

45:41.925 --> 45:44.245
if we were to partner

45:41.925 --> 45:44.245
with you guys,

45:44.285 --> 45:47.525
we'd look to invest

45:44.285 --> 45:47.525
the full 400,000 that

45:44.285 --> 45:47.525
you are seeking here.

45:47.565 --> 45:50.365
And then in time,

45:47.565 --> 45:50.365
when the first site

45:47.565 --> 45:50.365
is proven,

45:50.405 --> 45:53.045
if you still want to open

45:50.405 --> 45:53.045
multiple sites thereafter,

45:53.085 --> 45:54.405
we'd look to provide

45:53.085 --> 45:54.405
additional funding

45:54.445 --> 45:55.965
to open other Pilgrim sites.

45:56.005 --> 45:57.365
Yeah, wow.

45:57.405 --> 45:59.565
That sounds,

45:57.405 --> 45:59.565
that sounds fantastic.

45:59.605 --> 46:02.885
It is a fantastic offer,

45:59.605 --> 46:02.885
if that's what transpires.

46:02.925 --> 46:06.045
I think it's just quite

46:02.925 --> 46:06.045
a lot to take in, isn't it?

46:06.085 --> 46:08.685
[Fred]<i> Pilgrim</i>

46:06.085 --> 46:08.685
<i>wanted Â£400,000</i>

46:08.725 --> 46:10.725
<i>to open a London restaurant,</i>

46:10.765 --> 46:14.085
<i>but Matt has a very different</i>

46:10.765 --> 46:14.085
<i>proposal for them to consider.</i>

46:14.125 --> 46:16.205
I don't know if you know

46:14.125 --> 46:16.205
much about our group.

46:16.245 --> 46:19.205
We started nine years ago,

46:16.245 --> 46:19.205
a few cocktail bars.

46:19.245 --> 46:23.445
Our next venture is going

46:19.245 --> 46:23.445
to be a really high-end

46:19.245 --> 46:23.445
food market

46:23.485 --> 46:24.605
in the center of Liverpool.

46:25.685 --> 46:27.925
So, if I was to come back

46:25.685 --> 46:27.925
and make an offer,

46:27.965 --> 46:31.365
we can offer Â£600,000,

46:27.965 --> 46:31.365
the restaurant

46:27.965 --> 46:31.365
on a mezzanine terrace

46:31.405 --> 46:33.205
in our new development.

46:33.245 --> 46:36.445
So, you'd become

46:33.245 --> 46:36.445
the centerpiece

46:33.245 --> 46:36.445
of this venue.

46:36.485 --> 46:38.045
Is that something

46:36.485 --> 46:38.045
that would interest you?

46:38.085 --> 46:39.445
[Jamie] Yeah,

46:38.085 --> 46:39.445
that sounds fantastic.

46:39.485 --> 46:41.805
-Yeah, sounds brilliant.

46:39.485 --> 46:41.805
-Yeah, definitely.

46:41.845 --> 46:43.245
[Jamie] Absolutely.

46:43.285 --> 46:44.925
[Dave]<i> I mean, it's a great</i>

46:43.285 --> 46:44.925
<i>opportunity.</i>

46:44.965 --> 46:49.085
Restaurant up north.

46:44.965 --> 46:49.085
I mean, massive expanse,

46:44.965 --> 46:49.085
terrace, it's all there.

46:49.125 --> 46:51.965
To move to a different city

46:49.125 --> 46:51.965
and set up

46:52.005 --> 46:53.645
is a huge commitment.

46:53.685 --> 46:55.245
<i>We've got a lot</i>

46:53.685 --> 46:55.245
<i>to think about now,</i>

46:55.285 --> 46:56.885
<i>with some very different</i>

46:55.285 --> 46:56.885
<i>offers on the table.</i>

47:09.245 --> 47:10.965
[Dave sighs] Wow.

47:11.005 --> 47:12.565
[man] How are you?

47:12.605 --> 47:15.765
The offers we've

47:12.605 --> 47:15.765
just been put forward,

47:12.605 --> 47:15.765
potential offers...

47:15.805 --> 47:17.085
Looking good?

47:17.125 --> 47:18.885
A little bit

47:17.125 --> 47:18.885
of a curveball, really.

47:18.925 --> 47:19.845
Really?

47:19.885 --> 47:21.405
Restaurant site

47:19.885 --> 47:21.405
up in Liverpool.

47:21.925 --> 47:22.965
In Liverpool?

47:23.005 --> 47:26.605
Yeah. But I think

47:23.005 --> 47:26.605
we just get service

47:26.645 --> 47:29.405
out of the way first,

47:26.645 --> 47:29.405
to be honest. You know

47:26.645 --> 47:29.405
what I mean?

47:29.445 --> 47:31.205
Yes, mate.

47:31.245 --> 47:33.685
[Fred]<i> There's just</i>

47:31.245 --> 47:33.685
<i>an hour to go until</i>

47:31.245 --> 47:33.685
<i>their last lunch service.</i>

47:34.845 --> 47:37.565
I think we're all feeling

47:34.845 --> 47:37.565
the pressure today.

47:37.605 --> 47:39.045
Coming out of those

47:37.605 --> 47:39.045
meetings this morning

47:39.085 --> 47:40.525
that we had

47:39.085 --> 47:40.525
with the investors.

47:40.565 --> 47:42.685
Now going into the service...

47:42.725 --> 47:45.565
Realizing now

47:42.725 --> 47:45.565
what we have to lose.

47:45.605 --> 47:48.205
There's a lot of pressure.

47:45.605 --> 47:48.205
A lot of pressure.

47:48.245 --> 47:50.525
[Fred]<i> Today's menu</i>

47:48.245 --> 47:50.525
<i>will be the a la carte option</i>

47:50.565 --> 47:53.045
<i>the investors wanted to see.</i>

47:53.085 --> 47:56.645
<i>And Dave is keen to show them</i>

47:53.085 --> 47:56.645
<i>that they can be flexible,</i>

47:56.685 --> 47:58.965
<i>so he's even added</i>

47:56.685 --> 47:58.965
<i>a sharing special.</i>

47:59.005 --> 48:00.965
This is from

47:59.005 --> 48:00.965
the north of Spain

48:01.005 --> 48:02.605
and we're going

48:01.005 --> 48:02.605
to do it<i> asado,</i>

48:02.645 --> 48:04.965
-which is wood-fired,

48:02.645 --> 48:04.965
basically barbecued style.

48:02.645 --> 48:04.965
-[Jamie] Nice.

48:05.005 --> 48:07.125
[Dave] It's going to put

48:05.005 --> 48:07.125
the sharing element across.

48:08.205 --> 48:09.565
[Jamie] Sounds great.

48:08.205 --> 48:09.565
Any crackling?

48:09.605 --> 48:11.205
[Dave] Crackling

48:09.605 --> 48:11.205
we're working on

48:09.605 --> 48:11.205
right now, actually.

48:11.245 --> 48:12.605
-Yeah.

48:11.245 --> 48:12.605
-[Dave] Funny you mention that.

48:12.645 --> 48:14.205
-You know I love cracklings.

48:12.645 --> 48:14.205
-[Dave] It's in the oven.

48:14.645 --> 48:15.565
Happy?

48:15.605 --> 48:17.885
Yeah, happy, man,

48:15.605 --> 48:17.885
sounds beautiful.

48:22.085 --> 48:25.285
[Fred]<i> 2:00 p.m. Pilgrim</i>

48:22.085 --> 48:25.285
<i>is open for business.</i>

48:25.325 --> 48:27.885
-Hello, how are you?

48:25.325 --> 48:27.885
-[customer] Good, thank you.

48:27.925 --> 48:29.725
[Fred]<i> Last night,</i>

48:27.925 --> 48:29.725
<i>the investors thought</i>

48:29.765 --> 48:32.205
<i>their approach was too rigid.</i>

48:32.245 --> 48:34.165
<i>Today, the boys need to prove</i>

48:34.205 --> 48:36.405
<i>they can pull off</i>

48:34.205 --> 48:36.405
<i>a relaxed service</i>

48:36.445 --> 48:38.845
<i>to be in with a chance</i>

48:36.445 --> 48:38.845
<i>of winning an investment.</i>

48:38.885 --> 48:40.925
We've also got a special,

48:38.885 --> 48:40.925
the pork chop,

48:40.965 --> 48:42.045
so that's to share as well.

48:42.085 --> 48:43.405
Right, first order in then.

48:43.445 --> 48:45.245
We've got a poached scallop

48:43.445 --> 48:45.245
and a terrine.

48:45.285 --> 48:47.085
Pork chop special

48:45.285 --> 48:47.085
and a quail.

48:47.125 --> 48:47.965
<i>Oui,</i> chef.

48:48.885 --> 48:53.205
Oh, sounds gorgeous. Decided.

48:53.245 --> 48:55.405
Oh, that looks nice.

48:55.445 --> 48:57.005
Just going to see

48:55.445 --> 48:57.005
how this service works

48:57.045 --> 48:58.845
as different to last night.

48:58.885 --> 49:01.965
<i>Its all a bit experimental.</i>

48:58.885 --> 49:01.965
<i>Probably not the smartest</i>

48:58.885 --> 49:01.965
<i>thing to do.</i>

49:02.005 --> 49:04.885
Hopefully we don't do

49:02.005 --> 49:04.885
anything to ruin

49:02.005 --> 49:04.885
our chances today.

49:07.325 --> 49:09.685
[Fred]<i> As they</i>

49:07.325 --> 49:09.685
<i>are in competition</i>

49:07.325 --> 49:09.685
<i>with each other,</i>

49:09.725 --> 49:13.165
<i>today the investors</i>

49:09.725 --> 49:13.165
<i>will dine separately.</i>

49:13.205 --> 49:15.685
I think today's lunch

49:13.205 --> 49:15.685
has to be a lot more

49:13.205 --> 49:15.685
accessible,

49:15.725 --> 49:17.045
and a little bit

49:15.725 --> 49:17.045
more diverse.

49:17.085 --> 49:18.445
I hope you have

49:17.085 --> 49:18.445
a lovely afternoon.

49:18.485 --> 49:20.125
Thanks very much.

49:20.165 --> 49:21.725
[Farrell]<i> We've asked</i>

49:20.165 --> 49:21.725
<i>to see more</i>

49:20.165 --> 49:21.725
<i>of a social atmosphere,</i>

49:21.765 --> 49:22.925
<i>a more sharing</i>

49:21.765 --> 49:22.925
<i>kind of atmosphere</i>

49:22.965 --> 49:25.045
<i>that we can get involved in,</i>

49:22.965 --> 49:25.045
<i>and I think</i>

49:25.085 --> 49:28.045
this is all part of

49:25.085 --> 49:28.045
what's going to make

49:25.085 --> 49:28.045
a successful restaurant.

49:30.405 --> 49:31.845
What have you got on

49:30.405 --> 49:31.845
from last night? The same?

49:31.885 --> 49:33.805
So, it's exactly the same

49:31.885 --> 49:33.805
menu as last night.

49:33.845 --> 49:35.845
But it's more a la carte.

49:35.885 --> 49:38.925
The special for today

49:35.885 --> 49:38.925
is the traditional

49:35.885 --> 49:38.925
Spanish-style wood-fired pork.

49:38.965 --> 49:40.205
-I'll take this, to try.

49:38.965 --> 49:40.205
-Yep.

49:42.045 --> 49:43.765
[Connell]

49:42.045 --> 49:43.765
<i>From an Imbiba perspective,</i>

49:43.805 --> 49:46.205
<i>it's really, really important</i>

49:43.805 --> 49:46.205
<i>that their proposition</i>

49:43.805 --> 49:46.205
<i>is laser clear.</i>

49:46.245 --> 49:47.645
-Hi, there.

49:46.245 --> 49:47.645
-Enjoy, have

49:46.245 --> 49:47.645
a lovely afternoon.

49:47.685 --> 49:48.845
Thank you very much.

49:47.685 --> 49:48.845
Thank you.

49:48.885 --> 49:50.685
[Connell]<i> Is it a</i>

49:48.885 --> 49:50.685
<i>high-end restaurant</i>

49:50.725 --> 49:52.245
<i>or is it not a high-end</i>

49:50.725 --> 49:52.245
<i>restaurant?</i>

49:52.285 --> 49:53.885
At the moment,

49:52.285 --> 49:53.885
it's a little bit confusing.

49:53.925 --> 49:55.805
<i>We're told it's going</i>

49:53.925 --> 49:55.805
<i>to be a bit more flexible.</i>

49:55.845 --> 49:58.525
<i>So really looking forward</i>

49:55.845 --> 49:58.525
<i>to seeing how that works.</i>

49:58.565 --> 50:00.445
Just so you know,

49:58.565 --> 50:00.445
the investor's in, guys.

50:03.605 --> 50:05.965
[Connell] It's good

50:03.605 --> 50:05.965
atmosphere, nice buzz,

50:06.005 --> 50:08.325
looking forward

50:06.005 --> 50:08.325
to the wood-fired pork chop,

50:08.365 --> 50:10.845
which is a special,

50:08.365 --> 50:10.845
which they didn't have

50:08.365 --> 50:10.845
on the menu last night.

50:10.885 --> 50:12.725
[Dave] Pork special.

50:10.885 --> 50:12.725
Let's hit it, yes, please.

50:13.525 --> 50:15.085
It's quite chunky, the pork.

50:15.125 --> 50:16.645
-Wow. [laughs]

50:15.125 --> 50:16.645
-There we go.

50:16.685 --> 50:17.845
I hope you're hungry.

50:17.885 --> 50:19.005
[Farrell] Thank you.

50:21.045 --> 50:24.645
So that's a Â£400,000

50:21.045 --> 50:24.645
pork chop, basically.

50:25.485 --> 50:26.805
Hopefully he likes it.

50:33.125 --> 50:34.445
Very, very tasty.

50:34.485 --> 50:37.925
Very good quality meat,

50:34.485 --> 50:37.925
clearly. Very nicely cooked.

50:37.965 --> 50:41.645
It's pretty impressive,

50:37.965 --> 50:41.645
and it's quite a hard dish

50:37.965 --> 50:41.645
to cook that and get right.

50:43.365 --> 50:46.725
<i>I think the potato</i>

50:43.365 --> 50:46.725
<i>is much better</i>

50:43.365 --> 50:46.725
<i>than it was last night.</i>

50:46.765 --> 50:49.845
The lentils are a little bit

50:46.765 --> 50:49.845
more al dente, which they

50:46.765 --> 50:49.845
weren't.

50:49.885 --> 50:52.845
So, all in all, really,

50:49.885 --> 50:52.845
really happy with that.

50:56.045 --> 50:57.685
[Fred]

50:56.045 --> 50:57.685
<i>It's the laid-back menu</i>

50:57.725 --> 50:59.685
<i>the investors</i>

50:57.725 --> 50:59.685
<i>were looking for.</i>

50:59.725 --> 51:00.885
What did you think?

51:00.925 --> 51:03.125
[Fred]<i> But they need</i>

51:00.925 --> 51:03.125
<i>to do market research</i>

51:03.165 --> 51:05.885
<i>before they'll back any idea.</i>

51:05.925 --> 51:07.765
Do you see it

51:05.925 --> 51:07.765
as a restaurant

51:07.805 --> 51:11.165
that you'd go to

51:07.805 --> 51:11.165
for a specific occasion,

51:07.805 --> 51:11.165
like a birthday party?

51:11.205 --> 51:13.885
Or is it something

51:11.205 --> 51:13.885
you'd just drop into...

51:13.925 --> 51:16.565
Yeah, I'd say probably

51:13.925 --> 51:16.565
not a special occasion.

51:16.605 --> 51:18.045
A lunch while

51:16.605 --> 51:18.045
you're out shopping.

51:18.085 --> 51:21.245
Did you find that

51:18.085 --> 51:21.245
it was a pretty

51:18.085 --> 51:21.245
sociable experience?

51:21.285 --> 51:23.885
Yeah, definitely.

51:21.285 --> 51:23.885
Like, we made friends

51:21.285 --> 51:23.885
with these already,

51:23.925 --> 51:25.045
-we didn't know each other.

51:23.925 --> 51:25.045
-[Farrell] Oh, you're not

51:23.925 --> 51:25.045
friends?

51:25.085 --> 51:26.525
Oh, right, okay.

51:26.565 --> 51:29.005
I would say it's like tapas

51:26.565 --> 51:29.005
but with a story behind it.

51:29.045 --> 51:30.645
And did you do

51:29.045 --> 51:30.645
much sharing?

51:30.685 --> 51:32.165
Yeah. We shared everything.

51:32.205 --> 51:34.325
[man] It kind of

51:32.205 --> 51:34.325
led us down a path

51:34.365 --> 51:36.165
that starters

51:34.365 --> 51:36.165
were to share but then

51:34.365 --> 51:36.165
there was only one scallop.

51:40.325 --> 51:42.245
Hey, Darrel,

51:40.325 --> 51:42.245
you having dessert?

51:43.885 --> 51:44.965
You got to try this, Fred.

51:45.005 --> 51:46.245
-You got to try it.

51:45.005 --> 51:46.245
-Is it nice?

51:46.285 --> 51:48.485
I would give you a bite

51:46.285 --> 51:48.485
but I'm not sharing.

51:48.525 --> 51:50.725
No, no, that's all right.

51:48.525 --> 51:50.725
So, what did you think today?

51:52.405 --> 51:53.965
Today was much better

51:52.405 --> 51:53.965
than last night.

51:54.005 --> 51:56.285
To me, the concept

51:54.005 --> 51:56.285
and the brand

51:56.325 --> 51:59.285
lends itself to the sharing

51:56.325 --> 51:59.285
and the, you know,

51:59.325 --> 52:03.645
more laid back.

51:59.325 --> 52:03.645
Not the sort of stuffier,

51:59.325 --> 52:03.645
you know, rigid menu.

52:03.685 --> 52:05.405
I think that you got

52:03.685 --> 52:05.405
a lot of thinking to do.

52:05.445 --> 52:07.605
-A lot of thinking.

52:05.445 --> 52:07.605
-Because you seem

52:05.445 --> 52:07.605
to be conflicted.

52:07.645 --> 52:09.445
So the pressure

52:07.645 --> 52:09.445
is on you now.

52:09.485 --> 52:11.205
-Thanks, Fred. I am gonna--

52:09.485 --> 52:11.205
-Let's reverse the tables.

52:11.245 --> 52:14.005
I'm going to have

52:11.245 --> 52:14.005
more dessert.

52:11.245 --> 52:14.005
That's the easy way.

52:14.045 --> 52:15.325
And I'm going to give

52:14.045 --> 52:15.325
you a deadline.

52:15.365 --> 52:17.365
If you are interested

52:15.365 --> 52:17.365
in investing in these guys,

52:17.405 --> 52:18.605
you've got to come

52:17.405 --> 52:18.605
back by tonight.

52:18.645 --> 52:19.885
-Okay?

52:18.645 --> 52:19.885
-Okay. That's clear.

52:19.925 --> 52:21.085
-Thanks, Fred.

52:19.925 --> 52:21.085
-Good luck.

52:21.125 --> 52:22.165
-See you later, Darrel.

52:21.125 --> 52:22.165
Take care.

52:21.125 --> 52:22.165
-Cheers.

52:24.245 --> 52:25.805
-[Farrell] Hi, Fred.

52:24.245 --> 52:25.805
-Matt, how is it going?

52:25.845 --> 52:27.245
Good, how are you?

52:27.285 --> 52:29.165
Have they done what

52:27.285 --> 52:29.165
you wanted them to do?

52:29.205 --> 52:31.045
I think definitely

52:29.205 --> 52:31.045
I've seen elements

52:31.085 --> 52:32.805
of what we wanted to see.

52:32.845 --> 52:35.845
Yeah, I think you've got

52:32.845 --> 52:35.845
to give them credit

52:32.845 --> 52:35.845
for turning that around.

52:35.885 --> 52:38.085
Well, Matt, the pressure

52:35.885 --> 52:38.085
is now on you.

52:38.125 --> 52:39.725
I'm going to give

52:38.125 --> 52:39.725
you a deadline.

52:39.765 --> 52:41.605
-[Farrell] Okay.

52:39.765 --> 52:41.605
-If you want to make

52:39.765 --> 52:41.605
them an offer,

52:41.645 --> 52:43.445
you need to come

52:41.645 --> 52:43.445
back by seven o'clock,

52:43.485 --> 52:46.085
we know it's game on,

52:43.485 --> 52:46.085
if not, we know

52:43.485 --> 52:46.085
it's game over.

52:46.125 --> 52:47.205
Okay.

52:47.245 --> 52:49.045
So good thinking

52:47.245 --> 52:49.045
and hope to see you later.

52:52.765 --> 52:54.645
[Farrell]<i> So, the guys have</i>

52:52.765 --> 52:54.645
<i>given me a lot to think about.</i>

52:54.685 --> 52:56.965
I was happy with how

52:54.685 --> 52:56.965
they've managed

52:54.685 --> 52:56.965
to make the changes,

52:57.005 --> 52:59.085
<i>and they're willing</i>

52:57.005 --> 52:59.085
<i>to make changes.</i>

52:59.125 --> 53:00.725
Guys, thanks

52:59.125 --> 53:00.725
very much for lunch.

53:00.765 --> 53:01.645
Ah, mate...

53:01.685 --> 53:02.925
[Farrell]<i> But are they ready?</i>

53:02.965 --> 53:04.485
<i>And could we put</i>

53:02.965 --> 53:04.485
<i>them in there,</i>

53:04.525 --> 53:08.765
right in the deep end

53:04.525 --> 53:08.765
ready to go

53:04.525 --> 53:08.765
and be fully committed?

53:08.805 --> 53:11.365
<i>I've got to make that</i>

53:08.805 --> 53:11.365
<i>decision in the next</i>

53:08.805 --> 53:11.365
<i>few hours.</i>

53:11.405 --> 53:12.925
So, guys, massive

53:11.405 --> 53:12.925
congratulations.

53:11.405 --> 53:12.925
Thought it was great.

53:12.965 --> 53:14.365
-[Jamie] Thanks very much.

53:12.965 --> 53:14.365
-Really good.

53:14.405 --> 53:15.685
[all] Cheers.

53:15.725 --> 53:18.165
My heart is saying

53:15.725 --> 53:18.165
great guys, super backable.

53:18.205 --> 53:20.165
<i>You know, you know that</i>

53:18.205 --> 53:20.165
<i>if you invest with these guys,</i>

53:20.205 --> 53:22.365
they will open

53:20.205 --> 53:22.365
a good restaurant.

53:22.405 --> 53:24.765
<i>But I just can't get my head</i>

53:22.405 --> 53:24.765
<i>around their desire</i>

53:24.805 --> 53:27.405
<i>to have a kind of high-end,</i>

53:24.805 --> 53:27.405
<i>more expensive restaurant.</i>

53:27.445 --> 53:29.925
I think trying to shape them

53:27.445 --> 53:29.925
in a different direction

53:29.965 --> 53:31.805
is not what we do at Imbiba.

53:31.845 --> 53:33.365
<i>I'm going to have</i>

53:31.845 --> 53:33.365
<i>to go away and give this</i>

53:31.845 --> 53:33.365
<i>a lot of thought.</i>

53:33.405 --> 53:35.405
<i>This is the hardest part</i>

53:33.405 --> 53:35.405
<i>of the job.</i>

53:36.805 --> 53:38.005
[Dave] I mean, that

53:36.805 --> 53:38.005
was a good service.

53:38.045 --> 53:39.765
That was a good service.

53:38.045 --> 53:39.765
It was a good service.

53:39.805 --> 53:41.365
I think we've done the best

53:39.805 --> 53:41.365
we can do, you know.

53:41.405 --> 53:43.085
-Yeah.

53:41.405 --> 53:43.085
-What we were

53:41.405 --> 53:43.085
setting out to do.

53:43.125 --> 53:45.365
Think no matter what happens,

53:43.125 --> 53:45.365
we can say

53:45.405 --> 53:46.525
we've done ourselves proud.

53:52.045 --> 53:53.685
[Fred]<i> Lunch is over.</i>

53:53.725 --> 53:56.765
<i>Now all Pilgrim</i>

53:53.725 --> 53:56.765
<i>can do is wait.</i>

53:56.805 --> 54:01.365
<i>Jamie, Ant and Dave</i>

53:56.805 --> 54:01.365
<i>came here looking for</i>

53:56.805 --> 54:01.365
<i>Â£400,000.</i>

54:02.885 --> 54:04.885
<i>If Matt or Darrel</i>

54:02.885 --> 54:04.885
<i>want to invest,</i>

54:04.925 --> 54:06.725
<i>they'll have until</i>

54:04.925 --> 54:06.725
<i>seven o'clock tonight</i>

54:06.765 --> 54:08.325
<i>to return with their offer.</i>

54:09.485 --> 54:10.725
[Jamie exhales]

54:12.445 --> 54:13.725
<i>If they both come back,</i>

54:13.765 --> 54:16.885
<i>the boys will have to choose</i>

54:13.765 --> 54:16.885
<i>between investors.</i>

54:18.005 --> 54:19.165
[Jamie] Pretty clammy.

54:19.205 --> 54:20.365
[chuckling]

54:20.405 --> 54:22.045
[Fred]

54:20.405 --> 54:22.045
<i>But if no one returns,</i>

54:22.085 --> 54:24.005
<i>Pilgrim will walk away</i>

54:22.085 --> 54:24.005
<i>with nothing.</i>

54:26.765 --> 54:28.565
Is there one you like

54:26.765 --> 54:28.565
more than the other?

54:29.125 --> 54:30.165
Darrel or Matt?

54:30.205 --> 54:31.525
No, I don't think so.

55:03.805 --> 55:06.725
[Fred] Matt, it's very nice

55:03.805 --> 55:06.725
to see you.

55:06.765 --> 55:07.925
-How are you?

55:06.765 --> 55:07.925
-Good.

55:07.965 --> 55:09.365
Hey, guys.

55:09.405 --> 55:10.365
How you doing, all right?

55:11.245 --> 55:12.365
[Fred] Take a seat, please.

55:14.965 --> 55:16.045
Matt, can I ask you

55:14.965 --> 55:16.045
to stay silent, please,

55:16.085 --> 55:18.005
because we've got

55:16.085 --> 55:18.005
until seven o'clock

55:18.045 --> 55:20.285
and Darrel may come in

55:18.045 --> 55:20.285
within the next

55:18.045 --> 55:20.285
two or three minutes.

55:25.645 --> 55:27.485
[all laughing]

55:45.565 --> 55:46.725
[Connell]

55:45.565 --> 55:46.725
<i>It's with a heavy heart</i>

55:46.765 --> 55:48.725
but we are not going

55:46.765 --> 55:48.725
to progress our interest

55:48.765 --> 55:50.325
in Pilgrim at this time.

55:50.365 --> 55:53.885
<i>You know, you have</i>

55:50.365 --> 55:53.885
<i>to be very, very clear</i>

55:50.365 --> 55:53.885
<i>on what you are,</i>

55:53.925 --> 55:55.965
what is your proposition,

55:53.925 --> 55:55.965
why are people going to you,

55:56.005 --> 55:57.365
why are they are going

55:56.005 --> 55:57.365
to your restaurant

55:57.405 --> 55:58.925
and not the restaurant

55:57.405 --> 55:58.925
next door?

55:58.965 --> 56:01.325
And I think that just

55:58.965 --> 56:01.325
needs a bit more

55:58.965 --> 56:01.325
refining with Pilgrim.

56:01.365 --> 56:03.685
<i>It's a great team,</i>

56:01.365 --> 56:03.685
<i>the food was brilliant,</i>

56:03.725 --> 56:05.005
<i>the service was brilliant,</i>

56:05.045 --> 56:07.125
<i>but it's still just</i>

56:05.045 --> 56:07.125
<i>a bit confused.</i>

56:10.685 --> 56:12.085
So, Matt, you came here

56:12.125 --> 56:14.485
because you want

56:12.125 --> 56:14.485
to give the boys an offer.

56:14.525 --> 56:17.485
-Yep.

56:14.525 --> 56:17.485
-Can we hear your offer

56:14.525 --> 56:17.485
and your vision please?

56:17.525 --> 56:22.125
We'd like to offer you

56:17.525 --> 56:22.125
your first Pilgrim restaurant

56:17.525 --> 56:22.125
in Liverpool

56:22.165 --> 56:24.565
in a Â£600,000 space

56:24.605 --> 56:26.685
which will give you a chance

56:24.605 --> 56:26.685
to establish yourselves

56:26.725 --> 56:28.765
over the next 12 months.

56:28.805 --> 56:31.285
You're going to have

56:28.805 --> 56:31.285
the full weight

56:28.805 --> 56:31.285
of Graffiti Spirits group

56:31.325 --> 56:33.485
helping you

56:31.325 --> 56:33.485
through that process.

56:33.525 --> 56:35.725
Would you like to have

56:33.525 --> 56:35.725
a conversation amongst

56:33.525 --> 56:35.725
yourselves?

56:35.765 --> 56:37.645
[Jamie] Yeah, sure, yeah.

56:35.765 --> 56:37.645
Couple of minutes.

56:37.685 --> 56:39.125
[Dave] Are we all right

56:37.685 --> 56:39.125
to just go in the bar?

56:43.645 --> 56:44.765
All right.

56:45.605 --> 56:47.885
Offer is fantastic.

56:47.925 --> 56:49.045
[whispers] I don't know

56:47.925 --> 56:49.045
if they're going to say yes.

56:49.085 --> 56:50.125
[whispers]

56:49.085 --> 56:50.125
I don't know either.

56:51.325 --> 56:52.485
I would if I was them.

56:53.165 --> 56:54.405
We all in agreement?

56:54.445 --> 56:55.725
[Jamie] I think we are. Yeah.

57:06.285 --> 57:07.685
So, what have you decided?

57:11.165 --> 57:13.645
Oh, yeah. We'd love

57:11.165 --> 57:13.645
to work with Matt.

57:13.685 --> 57:16.525
So, yeah, we'd bite

57:13.685 --> 57:16.525
his hand off, I think.

57:16.565 --> 57:17.725
-Yeah.

57:16.565 --> 57:17.725
-Shall I get

57:16.565 --> 57:17.725
some champagne?

57:17.765 --> 57:18.885
I guess so.

57:18.925 --> 57:20.085
[all laughing]

57:23.405 --> 57:26.085
[Farrell]<i> I'm really excited</i>

57:23.405 --> 57:26.085
<i>to work with the Pilgrim boys.</i>

57:26.125 --> 57:28.925
We're really happy to get

57:26.125 --> 57:28.925
a group of lads out of London,

57:28.965 --> 57:30.445
and up into the northwest.

57:30.485 --> 57:31.725
[Jamie] Good work, man,

57:30.485 --> 57:31.725
good work.

57:31.765 --> 57:34.965
I think Pilgrim as a brand

57:31.765 --> 57:34.965
and what it represents

57:35.005 --> 57:37.605
<i>will be really, really</i>

57:35.005 --> 57:37.605
<i>welcome by the city</i>

57:35.005 --> 57:37.605
<i>and the people of Liverpool.</i>

57:37.645 --> 57:39.805
I think they tell

57:37.645 --> 57:39.805
a really great narrative

57:39.845 --> 57:42.925
and everyone in Liverpool

57:39.845 --> 57:42.925
loves a great story.

57:42.965 --> 57:45.845
Blown away.

57:42.965 --> 57:45.845
Just absolutely blown away.

57:45.885 --> 57:48.365
All of the work, everything

57:45.885 --> 57:48.365
that we've done, there it is.

57:48.405 --> 57:50.085
And we've got it.

57:48.405 --> 57:50.085
We've got it.

57:50.125 --> 57:51.925
Up until a week ago,

57:50.125 --> 57:51.925
coming up here,

57:51.965 --> 57:53.765
we never would have

57:51.965 --> 57:53.765
thought that,

57:53.805 --> 57:56.365
potentially, this was going

57:53.805 --> 57:56.365
to take us to another city.

57:56.405 --> 57:58.165
Sort of fits with the narrative

57:56.405 --> 57:58.165
though, doesn't it, you know?

57:58.205 --> 58:00.285
We're on our

57:58.205 --> 58:00.285
own journey now.

58:00.325 --> 58:01.605
So there you go.

58:02.165 --> 58:04.725
[laughter]

58:04.765 --> 58:06.165
[Fred]<i> Sitting there</i>

58:04.765 --> 58:06.165
<i>with Pilgrim</i>

58:06.205 --> 58:08.365
<i>waiting for the investors</i>

58:06.205 --> 58:08.365
<i>made me realize</i>

58:08.405 --> 58:10.365
how much it meant to them.

58:10.405 --> 58:13.725
They looked so nervous,

58:10.405 --> 58:13.725
but they worked so hard.

58:13.765 --> 58:15.525
And in the end, they got

58:13.765 --> 58:15.525
what they deserved.

58:15.565 --> 58:17.965
Well done, boys.

58:15.565 --> 58:17.965
See you in Liverpool.

58:18.005 --> 58:19.565
-To Pilgrim.

58:18.005 --> 58:19.565
-[all] To Pilgrim.

58:23.565 --> 58:26.685
Heart is beating quite fast

58:23.565 --> 58:26.685
at the moment, to be honest

58:23.565 --> 58:26.685
with you.

58:26.725 --> 58:29.605
[Connell] They are incredible.

58:26.725 --> 58:29.605
I mean, I've been missing

58:26.725 --> 58:29.605
these all my life.

58:29.645 --> 58:30.885
They are amazing.

58:30.925 --> 58:32.565
Just don't want it to look

58:30.925 --> 58:32.565
like a big brown blob.

58:32.605 --> 58:34.325
I feel, when I looked

58:32.605 --> 58:34.325
at your business plan,

58:34.365 --> 58:36.685
that there was a bit

58:34.365 --> 58:36.685
of over-enthusiasm, almost.

58:36.725 --> 58:38.685
<i>Â£1 million is a big ask.</i>

58:38.725 --> 58:41.325
What I do worry about

58:38.725 --> 58:41.325
is where's that money going?
