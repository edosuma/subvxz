Subtitles by explosiveskull

00:49.088 --> 00:50.924
You ready to play?

00:58.131 --> 00:59.933
Is that absolutely necessary?

01:24.056 --> 01:25.957
Let me just set up a few things.

01:25.959 --> 01:27.294
Won't take more than a minute.

01:28.496 --> 01:29.828
As long as we're on schedule.

01:29.830 --> 01:31.365
I wouldn't want to
start without you.

01:31.931 --> 01:33.465
Oh, you're funny.

01:33.467 --> 01:34.334
Very nice.

01:36.536 --> 01:40.171
So, yes, it is necessary to
keep the location a secret

01:40.173 --> 01:43.674
due to the legal
technicalities of the game.

01:43.676 --> 01:44.979
You know the rules, right?

01:47.047 --> 01:50.016
Yup, but you can
tell me again, Mr....

01:51.118 --> 01:52.316
No names.

01:52.318 --> 01:53.718
It works better for
me if we keep things

01:53.720 --> 01:55.088
less personal, you know?

01:57.590 --> 01:58.792
Right.

02:00.161 --> 02:02.527
Kind of like a
manager-employee relationship.

02:02.529 --> 02:03.363
I get it.

02:05.699 --> 02:07.099
If you like.

02:07.101 --> 02:09.667
Anyway, the game, there
are 19 other players

02:09.669 --> 02:12.172
at 19 other locations
just like this.

02:13.374 --> 02:14.174
In this city?

02:14.708 --> 02:15.943
All over the world.

02:16.843 --> 02:18.510
There's a clearing house

02:18.512 --> 02:22.247
that receives and broadcasts
the signal to select clientele.

02:22.249 --> 02:24.683
The same clearing
house acts as a broker

02:24.685 --> 02:27.955
for all wages
concerning the game.

02:32.292 --> 02:35.025
Receiving end, online?

02:35.027 --> 02:36.697
Okay.

02:38.097 --> 02:40.100
Yeah, just a couple
minutes, we'll get started.

02:44.103 --> 02:46.671
Have you done this a lot?

02:46.673 --> 02:48.275
A few times, yeah.

02:49.644 --> 02:51.509
There are five
preliminary rounds

02:51.511 --> 02:53.178
followed by the finalist round.

02:53.180 --> 02:55.179
If you leave at any point
during the preliminary rounds,

02:55.181 --> 02:56.983
you will leave with
zero prize money.

02:57.785 --> 02:58.953
I won't quit.

02:59.819 --> 03:01.886
All players who get
to the finalist round

03:01.888 --> 03:04.257
are committed to the
game and may not leave.

03:05.491 --> 03:06.860
I said I won't quit.

03:09.462 --> 03:10.430
Okay.

03:12.865 --> 03:14.332
Now, the finalists
will continue to play

03:14.334 --> 03:15.966
until there's only
one player left.

03:15.968 --> 03:18.005
That winner will
receive the money.

03:19.874 --> 03:22.239
Have you ever hosted a winner?

03:22.241 --> 03:23.408
Let's not worry about that.

03:23.410 --> 03:25.012
You just stay focused.

03:28.347 --> 03:31.251
It's weird that people would
bet on something like this.

03:33.186 --> 03:35.053
Do you know any real gamblers?

03:35.055 --> 03:37.758
Real gamblers will
make odds on anything.

03:40.727 --> 03:42.863
And the prize money, it's a lot?

03:43.697 --> 03:45.032
Some people think so.

03:47.267 --> 03:49.270
I heard it was a
million dollars.

03:50.503 --> 03:52.136
Where'd you hear that?

03:52.138 --> 03:53.939
Same place I heard
about the game.

03:54.274 --> 03:55.473
Hm.

03:55.475 --> 03:57.708
That's correct, and the
funds will be deposited

03:57.710 --> 03:59.312
in the <i>winner's</i> account.

04:03.483 --> 04:05.284
They must pay you a lot.

04:05.286 --> 04:07.087
That's why you're here, right?

04:09.121 --> 04:11.191
I'm here for the
same reason as you.

04:12.626 --> 04:13.494
I doubt that.

04:16.563 --> 04:17.964
Now it's almost time.

04:29.844 --> 04:31.912
I thought there
was gonna be a gun.

04:33.746 --> 04:34.814
Not yet.

04:37.650 --> 04:39.283
Have I met you before?

05:05.277 --> 05:07.847
Congratulations, your
drug test came back clean.

05:08.547 --> 05:09.516
Of course it did.

05:10.784 --> 05:12.583
I'm sorry, we have to check.

05:12.585 --> 05:14.319
Some players come in high,

05:14.321 --> 05:17.187
performance enhancing
drugs, so to speak.

05:17.189 --> 05:18.557
Well, drugs are where you go

05:18.559 --> 05:20.326
when you can't stand
the pain anymore.

05:22.528 --> 05:25.064
Where do you go, if
you don't have drugs?

05:26.200 --> 05:27.835
I guess we'll find out.

05:29.770 --> 05:31.136
Hm.

05:31.138 --> 05:32.737
Yes?

05:32.739 --> 05:33.705
We're good.

05:33.707 --> 05:34.542
You're good?

05:35.508 --> 05:37.544
Okay, standing by.

05:40.347 --> 05:43.083
I know that they can
see us, but can they...

05:43.782 --> 05:45.482
Hear us? No.

05:45.484 --> 05:46.384
Say what you want.

05:46.386 --> 05:47.854
Your secrets are safe with me.

05:48.989 --> 05:50.190
I don't have any secrets.

05:50.756 --> 05:52.225
Everyone has secrets.

05:52.691 --> 05:55.362
No, all my shit's pretty
much out in the open.

05:55.761 --> 05:57.329
All the shit you know about.

05:58.330 --> 06:00.266
I think I know my
shit pretty well.

06:02.503 --> 06:06.240
This game has a way of
illuminating a person.

06:17.417 --> 06:18.850
Oh, that's nice.

06:18.852 --> 06:20.751
You gonna put on
some mood music?

06:20.753 --> 06:22.088
I'll take the Chardonnay.

06:23.157 --> 06:24.855
So here's what's gonna happen,

06:24.857 --> 06:27.626
round one, on my signal, you,
along with 19 other players,

06:27.628 --> 06:30.464
will hold your hand over the
candle and keep it there.

06:32.032 --> 06:34.030
When three people have
removed their hand,

06:34.032 --> 06:35.333
the round is over.

06:35.335 --> 06:36.802
Those players are
out of the game.

06:36.804 --> 06:39.102
Everyone else will
advance to the next round.

06:39.104 --> 06:40.340
Understand?

06:42.741 --> 06:43.676
Hello?

06:43.977 --> 06:45.512
Yeah, I just...

06:48.148 --> 06:49.847
I heard it was different.

06:49.849 --> 06:51.381
Used to be.

06:51.383 --> 06:53.953
They like to change things
up, keep it exciting.

06:58.391 --> 07:00.324
You don't have to do this.

07:00.326 --> 07:02.061
It's still not
too late to leave.

07:03.063 --> 07:05.129
I've got nowhere else to be.

07:05.131 --> 07:06.566
How about a home?

07:07.967 --> 07:09.136
I messed that up.

07:10.970 --> 07:13.138
You must have family somewhere.

07:13.140 --> 07:14.306
Everyone has family.

07:14.308 --> 07:15.175
Do you?

07:16.742 --> 07:17.677
Yeah. Sure.

07:19.011 --> 07:20.113
Kids?

07:22.816 --> 07:23.650
A little boy.

07:25.018 --> 07:28.354
And how would you feel if
someone took him away from you?

07:29.989 --> 07:31.525
I guess I wouldn't like it.

07:33.260 --> 07:35.160
And how would you feel knowing

07:35.162 --> 07:37.498
that he should've been
taken away from you...

07:38.864 --> 07:40.199
that she...

07:41.434 --> 07:42.669
<i>he,</i> was better off...

07:45.272 --> 07:48.439
and that maybe now
the only thing to do

07:48.441 --> 07:50.107
is to win a big pile of money

07:50.109 --> 07:54.280
so that he could have the
kind of life that he deserves?

07:57.049 --> 07:58.749
Hm.

07:58.751 --> 08:01.989
I don't think I'd ever risk
my life over a pile of money.

08:03.523 --> 08:06.292
Well, that's all mine's
good for at this point.

08:09.061 --> 08:10.129
Hey, listen.

08:11.230 --> 08:12.298
Look at me.

08:16.602 --> 08:18.636
We're in this
together, you and me.

08:18.638 --> 08:20.975
I'm rooting for
you, you understand?

08:22.674 --> 08:25.210
So just settle in.

08:25.212 --> 08:26.313
We'll do this.

08:29.648 --> 08:31.648
Word of advice, this is
as much a mental game

08:31.650 --> 08:33.583
as anything else, so
just keep that in mind

08:33.586 --> 08:36.090
if you really want to see
this through to the end.

08:41.027 --> 08:43.596
I'm gonna hear
the words "you win",

08:45.132 --> 08:47.234
or I'm not gonna
hear anything at all.

08:48.801 --> 08:49.934
That's it.

08:49.936 --> 08:51.604
Visualize success, that's good.

08:54.641 --> 08:56.410
You say that to
all your players?

08:57.176 --> 08:59.245
Just the ones that
seem to need it.

09:03.450 --> 09:06.085
Have you ever
played, from my side?

09:08.454 --> 09:11.058
Let's get through round
one, then we'll talk.

09:18.864 --> 09:20.231
We're about to begin.

09:20.233 --> 09:22.236
Last chance before
the pain starts.

09:24.638 --> 09:26.639
The pain started
a long time ago.

09:33.213 --> 09:34.111
That's it.

09:34.113 --> 09:35.146
Keep going.

09:36.550 --> 09:39.119
You can do this. Come on.

09:43.824 --> 09:45.155
Just breathe.

09:45.157 --> 09:46.793
Focus on breathing.

09:53.865 --> 09:54.833
You can do this.

09:54.835 --> 09:55.701
Come on.

10:03.909 --> 10:04.976
Just breathe.

10:04.978 --> 10:06.176
Okay, focus on breathing.

10:14.186 --> 10:15.719
Focus on breathing.

10:22.461 --> 10:24.094
Another player's out.

10:24.096 --> 10:25.195
Just one more player.

10:31.138 --> 10:32.840
Just one more
player has to quit.

10:44.984 --> 10:46.119
Number three's out!

10:53.359 --> 10:55.092
You made it.

10:55.094 --> 10:56.162
You did it.

11:19.118 --> 11:20.220
Let me see.

11:21.888 --> 11:22.756
Come on.

11:38.305 --> 11:40.741
So, we made a deal,

11:42.142 --> 11:44.375
and no, I haven't
played the game

11:44.377 --> 11:45.878
from your side of the table.

11:55.354 --> 11:56.389
How many?

11:57.422 --> 11:58.926
How many what?

12:00.393 --> 12:02.428
How many times
have you done this?

12:05.297 --> 12:06.399
14.

12:13.172 --> 12:14.941
And how many of
those players won?

12:17.543 --> 12:18.811
You don't want to know.

12:26.219 --> 12:27.321
None of them.

12:28.888 --> 12:33.726
Most players quit
before the final round.

12:38.598 --> 12:41.234
But some of them made it.

12:44.970 --> 12:48.274
I've seen two men and three
women blow their brains out.

12:53.680 --> 12:55.681
You're just a little bad
luck charm, aren't you?

13:17.970 --> 13:20.606
Did you ask the other
players why they did it?

13:23.476 --> 13:25.745
Same reason as you, the money.

13:29.581 --> 13:32.351
Same reason as everyone
I'm playing against now?

13:32.619 --> 13:34.617
I wouldn't worry about
the other players.

13:34.619 --> 13:37.054
I just want to know
who my competition is.

13:37.056 --> 13:39.891
Most games, you're competing
against someone, right?

13:39.893 --> 13:42.327
But in this game, you can't
affect the other players.

13:42.329 --> 13:44.798
Can they make you
leave this room?

13:47.734 --> 13:48.634
Who can?

13:50.003 --> 13:50.903
You could try.

13:52.404 --> 13:53.337
Okay, take me out.

13:54.273 --> 13:55.374
Who does that leave?

13:59.010 --> 14:01.212
That's right, you.

14:01.214 --> 14:05.319
And that's what they're betting
on, how much you can take.

14:06.786 --> 14:09.020
I'll take whatever
you throw at me.

14:09.022 --> 14:11.622
It won't be me
throwing it at you.

14:11.624 --> 14:13.659
So there is someone else here.

14:15.327 --> 14:16.794
I'm a facilitator.

14:16.796 --> 14:18.163
The challenges for each round,

14:18.165 --> 14:20.033
they've been chosen
by the organizers.

14:21.901 --> 14:23.099
So it's not you.

14:23.101 --> 14:25.004
You're just doing their
dirty work for them.

14:28.641 --> 14:29.843
I didn't make you come here.

14:32.345 --> 14:34.045
I didn't make you sit there.

14:34.047 --> 14:36.713
I didn't force you to put
your hand over a candle.

14:36.715 --> 14:38.214
You think I enjoy
watching you do this?

14:38.216 --> 14:41.420
You think I like watching
people hurt themselves?

14:44.290 --> 14:45.823
Man.

14:45.825 --> 14:50.597
Things I've seen, you
don't forget it, you know?

14:52.331 --> 14:54.467
Then why do you keep doing it?

15:00.138 --> 15:03.109
You've never done something
you knew wasn't good for you?

15:07.913 --> 15:08.749
Sit down.

15:23.162 --> 15:25.431
We're on the same side.

15:26.465 --> 15:29.835
That's the thing
about this game, it...

15:35.306 --> 15:36.643
Round two, ready.

15:39.912 --> 15:41.511
The thing about this game?

15:41.513 --> 15:43.147
What?

15:43.149 --> 15:46.119
You were just about to say
"the thing about this game."

15:49.955 --> 15:52.893
The thing about this game
is that it changes you.

15:56.863 --> 15:57.731
Good?

15:59.197 --> 16:01.634
I don't know how good
it's been for me.

16:02.869 --> 16:04.233
Maybe you've been
playing from the wrong

16:04.235 --> 16:05.172
side of the table.

16:12.678 --> 16:15.848
Are you sure we
haven't met before?

16:22.055 --> 16:23.056
It's time.

17:42.201 --> 17:43.069
Please.

17:45.236 --> 17:46.436
What is it?

17:47.607 --> 17:48.474
Round two.

17:49.309 --> 17:53.112
Players will put their bare
right foot inside the box.

17:53.879 --> 17:56.749
The three that remove
their feet lose.

17:58.783 --> 18:02.289
The rest move onto
the next round.

18:06.259 --> 18:08.295
And there's
something in the box?

18:10.530 --> 18:11.830
Yes.

18:15.702 --> 18:17.604
And you don't know what it is?

18:20.005 --> 18:20.873
No.

18:34.553 --> 18:35.552
Hey, hey.

18:35.554 --> 18:36.388
It's okay.

18:36.655 --> 18:38.455
What's in there?

18:39.658 --> 18:41.291
- I don't know.
- That's bullshit.

18:41.293 --> 18:42.492
They don't tell us.

18:42.494 --> 18:44.030
You said that you
have done this before.

18:44.429 --> 18:46.230
It's different every time.

18:46.232 --> 18:48.068
It's probably not
as bad as you think.

18:51.571 --> 18:52.869
Fuck it, I'm out of here.

18:52.871 --> 18:53.904
Now wait.

18:53.906 --> 18:55.207
What about your daughter?

18:56.141 --> 18:57.107
Why do you care?

18:57.109 --> 18:59.145
You get paid anyway, I assume.

19:01.947 --> 19:03.350
Are you afraid of rats?

19:04.716 --> 19:05.784
What?

19:07.587 --> 19:09.356
Are you afraid of rats?

19:19.498 --> 19:21.400
You need to decide, soon.

19:23.636 --> 19:24.902
One player just dropped out.

19:24.904 --> 19:26.736
That just leaves
two for elimination.

19:38.484 --> 19:39.985
This is insane.

20:19.324 --> 20:20.192
Cold.

20:25.697 --> 20:28.633
So it's just in there waiting
for me to put my foot in?

20:28.635 --> 20:30.067
There's a separation barrier.

20:30.069 --> 20:32.405
When I get the
signal, I remove it.

20:33.872 --> 20:34.974
How fun for you.

20:35.774 --> 20:37.176
I'm right here with you.

20:39.043 --> 20:40.479
That's a comfort.

20:40.946 --> 20:42.413
No, I mean it, okay?

20:42.415 --> 20:43.249
I'll help you.

20:46.551 --> 20:47.387
You better.

20:53.559 --> 20:55.195
It's almost time.

20:59.932 --> 21:01.401
I must be crazy.

21:35.600 --> 21:36.869
You got this.

21:39.003 --> 21:40.273
I got this.

21:59.858 --> 22:01.860
I mean, nothing's gonna happen.

22:06.564 --> 22:07.697
Oh, god, it's moving.

22:07.699 --> 22:09.199
It keeps moving.

22:09.201 --> 22:11.004
- Breathe.
- Mm-hm.

22:17.909 --> 22:18.942
It's touching me,
it's touching me.

22:18.944 --> 22:20.013
It's on me.

22:21.947 --> 22:23.015
It's off, it's off, it's off.

22:28.053 --> 22:29.155
Oh, fuck!

22:30.822 --> 22:31.888
Think something else, okay?

22:31.890 --> 22:32.992
Don't think about this.

22:33.658 --> 22:35.126
Oh, God, ow, ow, ow!

22:35.128 --> 22:36.761
- It's back on me.
- Think of something else.

22:36.763 --> 22:37.828
Okay, think of something
else, don't think about this.

22:37.830 --> 22:38.965
Oh, shit.

22:40.498 --> 22:41.633
I can't do this.

22:41.934 --> 22:43.567
You can, yes, you can.

22:43.569 --> 22:44.800
Ow, it's biting me!

22:44.802 --> 22:46.370
It's biting me.

22:46.638 --> 22:48.672
No, it's not...

22:48.674 --> 22:49.740
One player's out, okay?

22:49.742 --> 22:51.176
That just leaves one more left.

22:51.944 --> 22:52.876
Ow!

22:52.878 --> 22:53.913
Ow, it's eating me!

22:54.179 --> 22:56.248
Look at me, look at me!

23:00.919 --> 23:01.920
I'm right here with you.

23:04.657 --> 23:05.422
Do it for me.

23:05.424 --> 23:06.192
Say it.

23:08.860 --> 23:09.595
Say it!

23:10.163 --> 23:11.060
Do it for you.

23:11.062 --> 23:12.495
Do it for you.

23:12.497 --> 23:13.665
Good. Again.

23:13.933 --> 23:15.134
Do it for you.

23:17.602 --> 23:18.734
Good.

23:18.736 --> 23:19.605
Again.

23:20.540 --> 23:21.608
Do it for you.

23:24.476 --> 23:25.210
Do it for you.

23:26.913 --> 23:27.877
Do it for you.

23:27.879 --> 23:28.779
Do it for you.

23:28.781 --> 23:29.646
Do it for you.

23:29.648 --> 23:30.548
Do it for you.

23:30.550 --> 23:31.350
Do it for you.

23:31.684 --> 23:32.915
That's it! It's over. It's over.

23:32.917 --> 23:34.084
Ow!

23:59.610 --> 24:00.446
Don't look.

24:09.754 --> 24:10.622
Okay.

24:17.262 --> 24:18.665
I kissed your boo-boo.

24:29.809 --> 24:31.377
Standing by.

24:31.843 --> 24:33.444
We've got some time,

24:33.446 --> 24:36.648
and you look like you
could use a drink.

24:44.089 --> 24:45.157
Good.

24:45.858 --> 24:46.924
Need to stay hydrated.

24:46.926 --> 24:48.127
Lots of water.

24:49.294 --> 24:51.663
Gonna figure out
where I know you from.

24:55.266 --> 24:56.601
Well, good luck.

24:57.336 --> 25:00.739
Okay, let's say you don't quit.

25:01.072 --> 25:02.004
I won't.

25:02.006 --> 25:03.406
Right, you won't.

25:03.408 --> 25:04.875
Let's say you make it.

25:04.877 --> 25:06.142
You've already told me
what you're gonna do

25:06.144 --> 25:07.243
for your daughter.

25:07.245 --> 25:09.047
What are you gonna do for you?

25:10.581 --> 25:12.816
If you really think you're
gonna make it through,

25:12.818 --> 25:14.153
you should have a plan.

25:15.221 --> 25:17.757
Yeah, well, I'm not
really big on plans.

25:19.225 --> 25:21.692
That's revolutionary thinking.

25:21.694 --> 25:23.560
Got me where I am today.

25:23.562 --> 25:25.361
No, seriously, instead of
giving your daughter the money,

25:25.363 --> 25:28.231
why don't you take
her somewhere instead?

25:28.233 --> 25:30.735
Find a nice quiet place,
bring along her daddy.

25:32.437 --> 25:33.738
You had me going till you
mentioned that asshole.

25:34.072 --> 25:36.341
Okay, not him, a nice guy.

25:38.244 --> 25:39.943
Why is it that everyone thinks

25:39.945 --> 25:42.581
that if a woman has problems,
a man is somehow the answer?

25:43.415 --> 25:45.084
You don't believe in love?

25:46.517 --> 25:49.520
Maybe some people just
aren't meant for it.

25:49.522 --> 25:52.725
Maybe they're just
not built... for it.

25:54.760 --> 25:57.563
Maybe some people haven't
met the right guy.

25:58.563 --> 25:59.431
And that's you?

26:01.634 --> 26:04.467
From bad luck
charm to Mr. Right?

26:04.469 --> 26:05.737
You could do worse.

26:07.738 --> 26:08.605
Okay.

26:08.607 --> 26:09.806
All right.

26:09.808 --> 26:10.777
So say it is you,

26:11.811 --> 26:15.878
Prince Charming,
man of my dreams,

26:15.880 --> 26:16.846
we're living together.

26:16.848 --> 26:18.584
Mm-hm, married.

26:20.718 --> 26:21.552
Really?

26:22.454 --> 26:23.753
I don't do that
cohabitation shit.

26:23.755 --> 26:25.524
You either commit
or you get out.

26:27.059 --> 26:27.924
And that's you?

26:27.926 --> 26:28.828
Mr. Commitment?

26:30.096 --> 26:31.164
Damn straight.

26:32.398 --> 26:34.833
So, is this a proposal?

26:36.034 --> 26:37.335
I guess it is.

26:38.136 --> 26:40.072
Well, either it is or it isn't.

26:41.639 --> 26:42.542
It is.

26:44.443 --> 26:46.846
Sweep me up my
feet, why don't you?

26:48.714 --> 26:50.550
You don't find this
place romantic?

26:52.752 --> 26:55.288
So, we're in our home...

26:56.921 --> 26:58.290
I didn't say yes.

27:00.225 --> 27:01.561
You playing hard to get?

27:02.927 --> 27:04.429
No.

27:04.663 --> 27:05.798
Yes. Maybe.

27:06.665 --> 27:07.864
A little.

27:07.866 --> 27:09.732
I mean, come on, we
just started dating.

27:09.734 --> 27:11.670
How do I know you're not just
marrying me for my money?

27:12.937 --> 27:14.171
What if I don't need your money?

27:14.173 --> 27:15.907
What if I already have money?

27:16.308 --> 27:17.674
Great, then let's
get outta here.

27:17.676 --> 27:19.510
I don't have to do this anymore.

27:19.512 --> 27:21.613
Well, then again, maybe I
don't have that much money.

27:22.214 --> 27:23.782
Okay, so, no money.

27:24.983 --> 27:26.417
Why should I say yes?

27:27.586 --> 27:32.325
Because, deep down inside,
you believe in love too.

27:41.266 --> 27:44.236
So, what's it gonna be?

27:51.376 --> 27:53.976
How about we get
through the next round,

27:53.978 --> 27:55.180
then I'll tell you.

27:57.081 --> 27:58.684
You are playing hard to get.

28:03.321 --> 28:04.389
Ready for round three.

28:25.910 --> 28:27.745
What the fuck is it?

28:28.480 --> 28:30.349
Or should I ask what goes in it?

28:39.023 --> 28:39.958
Your other foot.

28:41.726 --> 28:43.795
We go till three
players drop out.

28:49.967 --> 28:51.269
You can do this.

29:00.846 --> 29:02.949
Have you ever done
this one before?

29:06.385 --> 29:07.483
No.

29:07.485 --> 29:09.487
This is new territory for me.

29:19.465 --> 29:20.933
They're telling me
we need to get ready.

29:24.636 --> 29:26.405
Should I sit or stand?

29:27.071 --> 29:28.340
Whatever you prefer.

30:21.926 --> 30:23.596
We're ready.

30:25.062 --> 30:28.633
I don't suppose anybody's
dropped out yet.

30:33.138 --> 30:34.040
Just wait.

30:35.273 --> 30:36.641
Okay.

30:43.815 --> 30:45.984
Round three, turn one.

30:52.256 --> 30:53.091
I'm sorry.

31:07.572 --> 31:09.873
That feels as bad as it looks.

31:22.120 --> 31:24.523
All players are still in.

31:34.933 --> 31:35.968
Second turn.

31:57.423 --> 31:58.791
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

31:59.625 --> 32:01.727
Do it for me, remember?

32:04.628 --> 32:05.962
Wait, wait for me.

32:05.964 --> 32:06.628
Wait.

32:23.782 --> 32:25.016
Turn number three.

33:03.655 --> 33:06.254
Player three has quit.

33:11.596 --> 33:12.665
Okay.

33:21.973 --> 33:22.841
Okay.

33:26.043 --> 33:26.911
Okay.

34:26.603 --> 34:27.804
There.

34:27.806 --> 34:28.873
All better.

34:35.781 --> 34:37.313
You're
pretty good at that.

34:37.315 --> 34:39.685
One
of my many talents.

34:41.085 --> 34:43.087
Nine players are
out by my count.

34:44.056 --> 34:45.757
You're knocking them down.

34:48.692 --> 34:52.630
So... what about the answer now?

34:54.031 --> 34:55.431
The answer to what?

34:56.167 --> 34:57.933
Are we gonna do it,
when all this is over?

34:57.935 --> 35:00.872
Are we gonna tie the knot?

35:02.840 --> 35:03.909
Sure.

35:05.342 --> 35:06.210
Well, then.

35:08.080 --> 35:11.616
Well, then how about a
kiss for your fiance?

35:20.324 --> 35:21.657
It's for the pain.

35:21.659 --> 35:22.795
Don't let them see.

35:33.438 --> 35:35.273
Well, passed the halfway point.

35:38.342 --> 35:40.543
Yeah, after this,
marriage should be easy.

35:40.545 --> 35:42.212
Yeah.

35:42.214 --> 35:44.650
Maybe every couple should go
through something like this.

35:47.351 --> 35:49.319
It's a great story to
tell the grandkids.

35:49.321 --> 35:50.487
Grandkids?

35:50.489 --> 35:51.855
We haven't even gone
on the honeymoon.

35:53.857 --> 35:55.293
Please, honeymoon.

35:56.360 --> 35:57.793
Why not?

35:57.795 --> 35:59.561
Must be somewhere
you want to go.

35:59.563 --> 36:02.333
Vegas, Paris, Costa Rica?

36:04.168 --> 36:05.203
Not really.

36:06.270 --> 36:07.904
Come on, nothing?

36:07.906 --> 36:09.241
Nothing interests you?

36:17.915 --> 36:19.181
When I was a little girl,

36:19.183 --> 36:21.117
I used to ride
the bus to school,

36:21.119 --> 36:24.554
and every day on the highway,
we would pass this barn,

36:24.556 --> 36:27.393
on the top of it,
read "See Rock City".

36:33.297 --> 36:35.033
What's Rock City?

36:41.239 --> 36:44.909
I don't know, but I
always wanted to find out.

36:48.179 --> 36:49.378
Okay.

36:49.380 --> 36:54.018
So, we go see what's
up with this Rock City,

36:55.020 --> 36:57.587
and afterwards, when we
get back to our apartment

36:57.589 --> 36:58.454
in the city...

36:59.523 --> 37:01.056
In our house in the country.

37:01.058 --> 37:02.992
Country's boring.

37:02.994 --> 37:04.897
Can't have horses in the city.

37:06.764 --> 37:08.364
Horses?

37:08.366 --> 37:09.366
More than one?

37:09.668 --> 37:11.370
You can't have just one horse.

37:14.239 --> 37:16.473
I'm not shoveling horse shit.

37:16.475 --> 37:18.342
Fine, I want a divorce.

37:19.509 --> 37:20.446
On what grounds?

37:21.913 --> 37:23.882
Irreconcilable differences.

37:27.819 --> 37:29.755
Okay, fine.

37:30.788 --> 37:34.392
A house in the
country with horses.

37:41.866 --> 37:43.969
Wow, what a pushover.

37:46.670 --> 37:47.772
What can I say?

37:48.806 --> 37:50.008
I'm in love.

38:13.065 --> 38:15.967
You know, you can rest in
that house in the woods.

38:17.268 --> 38:19.003
Then I'd sleep for a week.

38:19.938 --> 38:21.306
And after you wake up?

38:26.244 --> 38:29.514
I don't know, maybe
plant a garden.

38:31.348 --> 38:33.251
What do you know about gardens?

38:37.221 --> 38:39.056
As much as I know about
anything else, I guess.

38:39.357 --> 38:41.326
You think you could keep
a bunch of plants alive?

38:42.527 --> 38:43.992
What about you, mister?

38:43.994 --> 38:45.897
You're just gonna
live off my money?

38:59.076 --> 39:00.845
There's lots of stuff I can do.

39:07.953 --> 39:09.922
I didn't mean anything by it.

39:14.192 --> 39:15.828
I know what you meant.

39:17.127 --> 39:19.330
Come on,
I was just joking.

39:19.764 --> 39:21.233
Sounded like an insult.

39:22.701 --> 39:23.967
Why would I insult you?

39:23.969 --> 39:25.571
You're the only
friend that I have.

39:31.074 --> 39:32.143
That's true.

39:33.944 --> 39:35.046
Standing by.

39:42.587 --> 39:44.922
God, can't they just
give it a minute?

39:49.560 --> 39:53.128
I know, like, what are
they in a hurry for?

39:53.130 --> 39:54.532
They'll make their money.

39:56.601 --> 39:59.204
Have you met them, the
people running this?

40:00.705 --> 40:01.538
A couple.

40:02.272 --> 40:04.175
They're not like what you think.

40:05.944 --> 40:07.275
I think they're a
bunch of weirdos

40:07.277 --> 40:09.113
who get off watching sick shit.

40:11.583 --> 40:13.181
That's not it, at all.

40:13.183 --> 40:16.485
They're more like researchers
of human behavior,

40:16.487 --> 40:18.522
and this is the
ultimate laboratory.

40:20.025 --> 40:21.093
Come on.

40:23.427 --> 40:25.226
No, seriously, how do you
think they have the money

40:25.228 --> 40:27.295
to fund an operation like this?

40:27.297 --> 40:30.935
They get to bet on human
behavior every day, and win.

40:31.869 --> 40:34.005
Of course they'd be interested
in a game like this.

40:35.072 --> 40:37.206
We're just pawns to them.

40:37.208 --> 40:39.411
I doubt they even see
us as people at all.

40:41.244 --> 40:42.712
But it doesn't really matter

40:42.714 --> 40:44.382
what they think though, does it?

40:49.487 --> 40:52.188
And anyway, you
should be grateful

40:52.190 --> 40:54.090
they've even given
you this opportunity.

40:54.092 --> 40:57.029
If you weren't here,
where would you be?

41:04.435 --> 41:07.704
On the street, in a crack
house sucking dick for a fix

41:07.706 --> 41:10.042
until your looks rot away
and your teeth fall out?

41:12.243 --> 41:13.775
Where would your daughter be?

41:13.777 --> 41:16.045
In a group home getting
daily beat downs

41:16.047 --> 41:19.284
from all the other toss aways
with fuck-ups for parents.

41:20.851 --> 41:22.717
You know, you should
be thanking the people

41:22.719 --> 41:25.991
who created this game, and
you should be thanking me.

41:27.058 --> 41:28.694
This is the best opportunity

41:29.560 --> 41:32.096
for someone who screwed up
all their other options.

41:35.833 --> 41:39.003
Well, I'll be sure to send
them thank you notes later.

41:45.177 --> 41:47.279
Look at that, our first fight.

41:52.382 --> 41:55.784
Come on, I was just playing.

41:55.786 --> 41:57.288
Let's get back to our house.

42:01.859 --> 42:02.728
Maybe later.

42:06.764 --> 42:07.896
Hm.

42:07.898 --> 42:08.766
Time's up.

42:49.306 --> 42:51.243
How long can you
hold your breath?

42:53.978 --> 42:56.347
It's a simple question, really.

42:57.114 --> 42:59.618
How long can you
hold your breath?

43:01.886 --> 43:03.319
I don't know.

43:03.321 --> 43:05.087
Round four is easy.

43:05.089 --> 43:07.058
You just have to
hold your breath.

43:08.159 --> 43:10.194
I just have
to hold my breath?

43:10.628 --> 43:12.293
Yeah, well, that is
while I'm holding

43:12.295 --> 43:13.598
your head underwater.

43:14.531 --> 43:15.799
You don't have a fear
of drowning, do you?

43:15.801 --> 43:19.000
Hydrophobia, I
think it's called.

43:19.002 --> 43:23.542
'Cause if you did, this
will be pretty tough.

43:27.911 --> 43:28.813
Bite on this.

43:32.083 --> 43:34.319
I'm kidding, just hold onto it.

43:35.219 --> 43:36.284
Jeez.

43:36.286 --> 43:38.052
Here's what's gonna happen,

43:38.054 --> 43:39.824
you're gonna face the tank,

43:41.458 --> 43:42.991
and when the time comes,

43:42.993 --> 43:45.594
I'm gonna hold your
head under the water.

43:45.596 --> 43:46.498
You...

43:46.831 --> 43:48.565
You hold your arm out.

43:48.567 --> 43:51.766
If you want me to let you up,
you just let go of the bullet.

43:51.768 --> 43:52.936
See?

43:52.938 --> 43:54.936
First three players
to let go are out.

43:54.938 --> 43:56.340
Everyone else stays.

43:58.342 --> 43:59.440
You trust me, right?

43:59.442 --> 44:02.313
Well, you should, we're married.

44:04.147 --> 44:05.216
I guess.

44:06.351 --> 44:07.416
You guess?

44:07.418 --> 44:09.085
What do you mean you guess?

44:09.087 --> 44:10.422
You wouldn't marry somebody
you don't trust, would you?

44:12.956 --> 44:14.324
Good.

44:14.326 --> 44:15.724
You know, it's good
that you trust me

44:15.726 --> 44:17.259
'cause that way you
know that when it's time

44:17.261 --> 44:19.462
when everyone drops out,

44:19.464 --> 44:22.801
I won't just keep your
head under the water.

44:25.837 --> 44:26.670
Oh.

44:27.839 --> 44:29.505
Looks like we have someone
afraid of drowning.

44:29.507 --> 44:30.639
Our first dropout.

44:30.641 --> 44:32.344
You're not gonna
drop out, right?

44:33.110 --> 44:34.212
Right.

44:35.480 --> 44:37.980
Because you want that
house in the country,

44:37.982 --> 44:40.152
and you trust me, right?

44:42.353 --> 44:43.421
Right.

44:44.589 --> 44:45.489
Say it.

44:47.824 --> 44:49.493
I trust you.

44:49.726 --> 44:51.228
And you love me.

44:52.163 --> 44:53.231
Say it.

44:55.933 --> 44:56.998
I love you.

44:57.000 --> 44:58.233
Oh.

45:04.842 --> 45:05.942
Whoops.

45:05.944 --> 45:07.476
Looks like we got
another dropout.

45:07.478 --> 45:08.411
Okay, we got to get
this thing going

45:08.413 --> 45:09.781
before we lose any more.

45:10.748 --> 45:11.648
Deep breaths.

45:12.549 --> 45:15.653
When the third player
quits, I'll let you up.

45:18.288 --> 45:19.357
Get ready.

45:21.525 --> 45:22.594
On the count of three.

45:25.964 --> 45:26.831
One.

45:30.201 --> 45:31.269
Two.

45:33.571 --> 45:37.808
Three.

47:49.473 --> 47:50.607
I love you.

50:38.176 --> 50:39.340
I thought you were gone!

50:47.051 --> 50:49.186
Jesus, why didn't you
let go of the bullet?

50:52.688 --> 50:54.225
I swallowed it.

50:57.427 --> 51:01.063
Only way to make sure
that I didn't drop it.

51:27.123 --> 51:29.659
You know, with a little effort,

51:29.661 --> 51:31.563
you could be a very
attractive woman.

51:34.565 --> 51:35.833
What am I supposed
to say to that?

51:37.000 --> 51:39.101
Well, when someone
compliments you,

51:39.103 --> 51:40.705
it's polite to thank 'em.

51:48.478 --> 51:49.313
Thank you.

51:52.650 --> 51:54.619
How many guys have you dated?

51:56.420 --> 51:58.656
How's that any of your business?

51:59.956 --> 52:01.657
Well, if we're gonna be married,

52:01.659 --> 52:03.728
it's something a
husband should know.

52:05.828 --> 52:07.397
Come on.

52:07.598 --> 52:08.663
Come on, what?

52:08.665 --> 52:09.734
How many?

52:11.701 --> 52:12.803
I don't know.

52:13.571 --> 52:14.639
That many?

52:16.339 --> 52:17.840
Do you want to know
how many I've dated,

52:17.842 --> 52:19.310
or how many I've fucked?

52:19.976 --> 52:22.277
Because I didn't keep
count, but it was a lot.

52:22.279 --> 52:24.982
And sometimes I didn't
even know their names.

52:34.190 --> 52:36.994
Now why do I get the feeling

52:40.831 --> 52:43.668
that you're saying
this just to hurt me?

52:46.503 --> 52:48.105
You're sick in the head.

52:53.009 --> 52:54.844
I bet you were a real looker.

52:56.013 --> 52:59.116
I bet the boys couldn't
keep their hands off you.

53:01.485 --> 53:06.891
Hey, how old were you when
you did it the first time?

53:08.960 --> 53:12.130
Sweet 16, 15?

53:14.130 --> 53:15.032
Yeah.

53:16.766 --> 53:19.102
You were an early bloomer.

53:24.141 --> 53:27.275
I'm sorry, but you should
not have made me do that.

53:27.277 --> 53:30.110
You know, you can't do
whatever the fuck you want.

53:30.112 --> 53:31.512
Come on, don't be like that.

53:31.514 --> 53:33.081
Let's get back to
how it was before.

53:33.083 --> 53:34.516
And, you know, to
tell you the truth,

53:34.518 --> 53:37.255
I've been wanting to do
that for a while now.

53:40.389 --> 53:42.960
You can't do whatever
it is that you want.

53:44.527 --> 53:45.626
Who you kidding?

53:45.628 --> 53:47.063
Like you didn't want me to.

53:47.364 --> 53:48.329
What?

53:48.331 --> 53:49.165
What?

53:50.034 --> 53:51.666
Look, if you didn't
want me to do that,

53:51.668 --> 53:52.768
why are you still here?

53:52.770 --> 53:54.105
You could've left at any time.

53:55.139 --> 53:57.742
I'm here for the
game, that's all.

54:00.610 --> 54:01.742
Maybe this is part of it.

54:01.744 --> 54:02.746
You ever think about that?

54:05.648 --> 54:06.417
No.

54:07.317 --> 54:08.483
No.

54:08.485 --> 54:10.087
Well, of course it is.

54:10.821 --> 54:12.286
Why else would you be here?

54:12.288 --> 54:13.288
For my daughter.

54:13.290 --> 54:14.056
No!

54:14.058 --> 54:15.426
Don't give me that shit.

54:20.565 --> 54:22.163
No one saves us but ourselves.

54:22.165 --> 54:25.032
No one can and no one may.

54:25.034 --> 54:27.205
We alone walk the path.

54:33.509 --> 54:34.944
The Buddha said that.

54:34.946 --> 54:37.248
He was a smart guy,
everyone says so.

54:42.052 --> 54:43.786
You put yourself here.

54:43.788 --> 54:48.126
You decided to stay 'cause you
know that we belong together.

54:49.259 --> 54:51.495
I didn't ask for any of this.

54:53.897 --> 54:55.232
Why else are you here?

54:56.167 --> 54:59.067
Look, you could've
gone any time.

54:59.069 --> 55:00.469
There's the door.

55:00.471 --> 55:01.773
It's always been there.

55:05.976 --> 55:08.210
Go on.

55:08.212 --> 55:10.313
Go on if this is so wrong.

55:15.384 --> 55:17.254
Nobody's stopping you.

55:26.295 --> 55:30.167
You won't go, because you
know you belong here.

55:31.902 --> 55:35.505
You deserve this.

55:37.074 --> 55:41.279
Your whole life has
been a long, long path

55:43.746 --> 55:47.551
that's led you to me.

56:20.650 --> 56:21.518
We're on a schedule.

56:23.953 --> 56:25.887
You might want to reconsider.

56:25.889 --> 56:27.592
This might be your last chance.

56:29.460 --> 56:30.394
For what?

56:33.263 --> 56:36.132
To make love as a whole person.

56:41.103 --> 56:42.172
Round five.

56:45.643 --> 56:47.741
Here's where you
really start to leave

56:47.743 --> 56:49.946
some skin in the game,

56:51.915 --> 56:53.016
so to speak.

56:56.386 --> 56:58.154
Are you right or left-handed?

57:01.991 --> 57:03.358
Oh.

57:03.360 --> 57:05.659
Well, that makes
this more convenient.

57:05.661 --> 57:07.661
Round five.

57:07.663 --> 57:11.599
Every turn, each player
will cut through a knuckle

57:11.601 --> 57:12.936
on their left hand.

57:14.638 --> 57:16.739
It's your choice, really, but
I'd recommend cutting through

57:16.741 --> 57:19.377
the last knuckle on
the little finger.

57:22.179 --> 57:25.049
I'm not letting you
cut my fingers off.

57:28.585 --> 57:29.520
I'm not doing it.

57:39.529 --> 57:40.397
You are.

57:44.201 --> 57:45.469
It's not that bad, really.

57:45.770 --> 57:48.436
The Yakuza, you know
the Yakuza, right?

57:48.438 --> 57:50.639
Japanese mafia, they
do it all the time.

57:51.407 --> 57:54.377
When they've screwed up, it's
how they apologize for...

57:57.982 --> 57:59.081
Oh, forget it.

57:59.083 --> 58:00.549
Just take my word for it,

58:00.551 --> 58:02.686
you're not the first,
you won't be the last,

58:08.257 --> 58:09.426
unless you want to leave.

58:16.900 --> 58:18.302
Reach inside the bag.

58:29.145 --> 58:30.580
Tie it around your finger.

58:32.949 --> 58:34.318
It's for the bleeding.

58:41.558 --> 58:44.659
You go through with this,
you won't be the same.

58:44.661 --> 58:48.329
Some cultures would
consider you maimed,

58:48.331 --> 58:49.667
missing a body part.

58:52.902 --> 58:56.237
Personally, I think you'll
be plenty serviceable,

58:56.239 --> 58:58.407
but, you know...

58:58.409 --> 58:59.744
Let me help you out with that.

59:04.614 --> 59:08.652
If you're afraid of the pain,
I can give you another Oxy.

59:17.726 --> 59:18.628
Jesus!

59:29.172 --> 59:30.407
Suit yourself.

59:32.743 --> 59:36.112
After this round, you'll
probably be a freak,

59:36.946 --> 59:41.118
probably have a limp,
missing part of your hand.

59:41.918 --> 59:43.554
Who will want to fuck you then?

59:46.389 --> 59:48.556
I'm sure as long as I
have all my lady parts,

59:48.558 --> 59:50.661
any sick fuck like you will.

59:54.431 --> 59:56.333
We're ready.

59:57.634 --> 59:59.402
Place your hand on the board.

01:00:25.761 --> 01:00:28.798
Place the blade
over your finger.

01:01:12.808 --> 01:01:16.613
Well, looks like you won't
be getting married after all.

01:01:18.415 --> 01:01:21.451
Looks like you won't be
flipping anyone the bird either.

01:01:22.252 --> 01:01:27.021
Although, it does give
new meaning to the term

01:01:27.023 --> 01:01:29.192
giving them the finger, right?

01:01:38.201 --> 01:01:39.866
Well, it's about time now.

01:01:39.868 --> 01:01:40.770
Turn seven.

01:01:41.705 --> 01:01:43.471
After this, you won't be
able to pull the trigger

01:01:43.473 --> 01:01:45.241
with your left hand.

01:01:47.643 --> 01:01:50.680
That career in trick shooting,
it's out.

01:01:52.047 --> 01:01:53.216
Go on, get ready.

01:02:33.456 --> 01:02:35.023
You know, think about it,

01:02:35.025 --> 01:02:38.326
you don't really use your
left hand much anyway.

01:02:38.328 --> 01:02:40.397
It's a right-handed
world, you know?

01:03:31.714 --> 01:03:33.750
You're about to lose.

01:03:40.223 --> 01:03:41.590
You go through that door,

01:03:41.592 --> 01:03:43.023
all of this would've
been for nothing.

01:03:43.025 --> 01:03:44.328
Is that what you want?

01:04:01.143 --> 01:04:01.978
Wait!

01:04:06.817 --> 01:04:09.019
Three players have
all just dropped out.

01:04:12.188 --> 01:04:13.057
You made it.

01:04:20.429 --> 01:04:21.531
Don't do it.

01:04:24.301 --> 01:04:25.768
I have to pee.

01:07:26.382 --> 01:07:27.882
You mind?

01:07:27.884 --> 01:07:29.516
I thought I'd hold onto these.

01:07:29.518 --> 01:07:33.623
You know, something to remind
me of our time together.

01:07:37.560 --> 01:07:38.659
What?

01:07:38.661 --> 01:07:39.996
Like you're not gonna use 'em.

01:07:44.768 --> 01:07:46.203
Well, sit if you're gonna.

01:07:57.647 --> 01:07:59.346
You know, I'll
tell you something.

01:07:59.348 --> 01:08:02.552
I knew from the moment I saw
you that you'd go the distance.

01:08:04.154 --> 01:08:05.319
Is that right?

01:08:05.321 --> 01:08:06.454
Mm-hm.

01:08:06.456 --> 01:08:07.788
Damaged people are tough.

01:08:07.790 --> 01:08:09.959
Fire, temper,
steel, and all that.

01:08:11.194 --> 01:08:12.829
You could tell I
was damaged, huh?

01:08:13.128 --> 01:08:15.163
Honey, you shone
like a lighthouse.

01:08:15.165 --> 01:08:16.899
I wish I could've bet on you.

01:08:22.671 --> 01:08:24.273
Ever use one of those before?

01:08:27.243 --> 01:08:29.810
Don't worry, they're
pretty user-friendly.

01:08:29.812 --> 01:08:31.246
You just point and click.

01:08:31.913 --> 01:08:35.785
If you don't hear the
click, you're already dead.

01:08:39.087 --> 01:08:40.555
Have you been a dick
to all the players

01:08:40.557 --> 01:08:42.859
you've done this with,
or am I just special?

01:08:47.828 --> 01:08:49.497
I mean, they're all
special, really,

01:08:49.499 --> 01:08:54.371
but if it makes you feel any
better, you're my favorite.

01:09:00.676 --> 01:09:02.212
I knew I'd met you before.

01:09:05.481 --> 01:09:07.684
No, I'd remember you.

01:09:10.719 --> 01:09:12.356
I've known you my whole life.

01:09:13.788 --> 01:09:15.322
See, I watched you get drunk

01:09:15.323 --> 01:09:18.127
and smash my mother's
head into the front door.

01:09:19.962 --> 01:09:21.261
I dropped out of high school

01:09:21.263 --> 01:09:22.895
when you got jealous
of my friends

01:09:22.898 --> 01:09:25.102
because you thought I
was sleeping with them.

01:09:28.670 --> 01:09:31.939
I lied for you every time
the neighbors called the cops

01:09:31.941 --> 01:09:33.841
because of the noise.

01:09:33.843 --> 01:09:36.813
I know you, very well.

01:09:39.348 --> 01:09:42.917
You know, now that you mention
it, you do look familiar.

01:09:45.020 --> 01:09:48.825
You look like every smart
ass bitch I've ever known.

01:09:50.091 --> 01:09:54.895
All the teachers who
thought they were so clever,

01:09:54.897 --> 01:09:58.301
thought that they could
just push around a kid.

01:10:00.904 --> 01:10:02.537
All the bitches in school

01:10:02.539 --> 01:10:06.910
who thought they could just
lead a guy on, tease him.

01:10:08.977 --> 01:10:10.610
Those women at the jobs

01:10:10.612 --> 01:10:12.313
where they just wiggle
their tits and their ass

01:10:12.315 --> 01:10:14.215
to get ahead of some
poor son of a bitch

01:10:14.217 --> 01:10:18.254
who does the real work, who
carries his load and hers too.

01:10:25.026 --> 01:10:28.162
You look like every stupid cunt

01:10:28.164 --> 01:10:30.331
who thinks the world should
bow down and worship her

01:10:30.333 --> 01:10:33.737
because she was born with
a pussy made of solid gold.

01:10:34.236 --> 01:10:35.703
Nice.

01:10:35.705 --> 01:10:37.773
You kiss your mother
with that mouth?

01:10:39.642 --> 01:10:40.908
I don't know what happened.

01:10:40.910 --> 01:10:43.911
You know, we
started out so good.

01:10:43.913 --> 01:10:45.949
How did we end up like this?

01:10:46.682 --> 01:10:48.051
I guess it was fate.

01:10:48.785 --> 01:10:50.053
You think?

01:10:51.454 --> 01:10:52.789
I think...

01:10:54.956 --> 01:10:58.192
I think, you know what I think?

01:10:58.194 --> 01:10:59.062
Tell me.

01:11:00.563 --> 01:11:03.363
I think that you
found the perfect job

01:11:03.365 --> 01:11:06.469
to indulge in your sick
fucked up fantasies.

01:11:10.940 --> 01:11:12.239
You're right.

01:11:13.610 --> 01:11:15.643
I can do anything I
want to right now.

01:11:15.645 --> 01:11:16.743
You know what's funny?

01:11:16.745 --> 01:11:17.810
That's what you want me to do.

01:11:17.812 --> 01:11:19.113
You screwed your life up so bad,

01:11:19.115 --> 01:11:20.980
you'll take any
punishment I dish out

01:11:20.982 --> 01:11:22.819
'cause you know you deserve it.

01:11:24.085 --> 01:11:26.452
Don't touch me again.

01:11:26.454 --> 01:11:27.757
I'm not finished.

01:11:30.692 --> 01:11:32.493
You asshole.

01:11:32.495 --> 01:11:35.063
You have sat there and
watched me do everything

01:11:35.065 --> 01:11:38.034
that I've done and you
think that you can hurt me?!

01:11:40.636 --> 01:11:41.772
Oh, that's cute.

01:11:43.673 --> 01:11:44.508
Stop it.

01:12:00.722 --> 01:12:01.857
You fucker.

01:12:02.657 --> 01:12:05.395
You wouldn't have the
guts to do what I've done.

01:12:09.331 --> 01:12:12.132
You think you're some kind
of hard bitch now, huh?

01:12:12.134 --> 01:12:14.801
Is this what you
want, hard bitch?!

01:12:14.803 --> 01:12:15.668
You want to play?!

01:12:15.670 --> 01:12:16.537
Let's play.

01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:19.974
What?

01:12:22.311 --> 01:12:23.313
What?!

01:12:24.179 --> 01:12:27.950
You don't scare me.

01:12:31.654 --> 01:12:33.022
That rounds a freebie.

01:12:42.999 --> 01:12:44.467
If you're gonna stay...

01:12:51.606 --> 01:12:52.441
It's time.

01:13:04.419 --> 01:13:09.058
Just out of curiosity,
later, if I decide to quit,

01:13:10.593 --> 01:13:11.862
what's gonna stop me?

01:13:14.129 --> 01:13:17.331
You take that chair, if
you try to leave the game,

01:13:17.333 --> 01:13:20.402
either me or my compatriots
will shoot you dead.

01:13:45.393 --> 01:13:48.628
There are five players
in the final round.

01:13:48.630 --> 01:13:51.297
This will consist of as
many turns as necessary

01:13:51.299 --> 01:13:54.503
to eliminate four players.

01:13:56.606 --> 01:14:00.143
All players will pull the
trigger simultaneously.

01:14:11.754 --> 01:14:12.689
Wait for my signal.

01:14:21.196 --> 01:14:22.998
Take the position, please.

01:14:45.254 --> 01:14:46.323
We're ready.

01:15:03.005 --> 01:15:05.805
Thought you'd be disappointed.

01:15:06.709 --> 01:15:07.577
No.

01:15:08.311 --> 01:15:11.377
I'm glad you make it
through the first round.

01:15:11.379 --> 01:15:12.681
I hope you last a long time.

01:15:13.682 --> 01:15:15.051
I want to see you break.

01:15:15.784 --> 01:15:17.350
That'll be fun,

01:15:17.352 --> 01:15:20.688
to watch you break down
completely before you die.

01:15:30.231 --> 01:15:31.734
Just waiting on the report.

01:15:33.335 --> 01:15:38.506
And one player has
been eliminated.

01:15:38.508 --> 01:15:40.377
Down to you and three others.

01:15:41.977 --> 01:15:43.012
Relax.

01:15:43.913 --> 01:15:46.215
We'll give them a minute
to place their bets.

01:16:01.530 --> 01:16:03.366
Is it everything you hoped for?

01:16:06.802 --> 01:16:09.903
This is the easiest
thing I've done all day.

01:16:09.905 --> 01:16:14.241
Maybe so, but there's another
asshole out there somewhere,

01:16:14.243 --> 01:16:16.243
went through everything
you went through

01:16:16.245 --> 01:16:18.244
and now he's just
a pile of meat,

01:16:18.246 --> 01:16:20.215
brain splattered everywhere.

01:16:22.651 --> 01:16:26.686
See, you think your
pain buys you something,

01:16:26.688 --> 01:16:30.257
that you earn some
kinda big cosmic karma

01:16:30.259 --> 01:16:32.529
where now you'll get
what you deserve.

01:16:35.231 --> 01:16:39.933
I got news for you,
pain is just pain.

01:16:39.935 --> 01:16:42.504
It doesn't get you anything.

01:16:46.241 --> 01:16:47.310
You're wrong.

01:16:49.846 --> 01:16:53.450
We'll see, when it's your
brains that are on the floor.

01:16:54.650 --> 01:16:55.552
Oh.

01:16:57.986 --> 01:16:59.222
Time for turn two.

01:17:02.258 --> 01:17:04.294
You know, if you die here...

01:17:10.298 --> 01:17:11.500
...nobody will know.

01:17:15.570 --> 01:17:19.640
We'll just scoop up your body,
throw it to an incinerator.

01:17:19.642 --> 01:17:22.341
It'll be like you never existed.

01:17:22.343 --> 01:17:24.847
Nobody will know
you were ever here.

01:17:29.317 --> 01:17:31.855
But I'll be dead,
so I won't care.

01:17:51.540 --> 01:17:54.975
Bang!

01:18:01.150 --> 01:18:02.248
Oh.

01:18:05.521 --> 01:18:07.253
Oh, another one down.

01:18:07.255 --> 01:18:09.155
They're dropping like flies.

01:18:15.830 --> 01:18:19.368
The odds are
catching up with you.

01:18:20.803 --> 01:18:21.671
Yeah?

01:18:25.508 --> 01:18:27.911
How many times you
think you can beat this?

01:18:30.980 --> 01:18:31.848
29.

01:18:34.584 --> 01:18:36.920
That's a very specific number.

01:18:38.687 --> 01:18:40.657
Well, it's as far as I ever got.

01:18:41.789 --> 01:18:42.658
When?

01:18:44.026 --> 01:18:45.461
When I practiced.

01:18:47.295 --> 01:18:48.530
You practiced?

01:18:50.132 --> 01:18:51.363
Oh, yeah.

01:18:51.365 --> 01:18:52.933
Bought a real gun,

01:18:52.935 --> 01:18:56.403
put an empty shell in the
chamber, spun it around.

01:18:56.405 --> 01:18:59.676
It almost never came
up, and I did it a lot.

01:19:03.012 --> 01:19:04.577
What's the lowest
number of times you went

01:19:04.579 --> 01:19:06.215
before it did come up?

01:19:09.418 --> 01:19:10.453
Three.

01:19:11.786 --> 01:19:13.252
Hm.

01:19:13.254 --> 01:19:17.560
Well, just so happens we're
coming up on turn number three.

01:19:29.405 --> 01:19:32.038
What part do you enjoy the most,

01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:34.610
watching all the pain, or this?

01:19:37.146 --> 01:19:38.815
Darling, I like it all.

01:19:41.115 --> 01:19:42.718
Take your position, please.

01:20:29.798 --> 01:20:31.500
Why don't you take a turn?

01:20:38.473 --> 01:20:40.810
Because I don't have to play.

01:20:43.911 --> 01:20:44.780
That's a shame.

01:20:46.449 --> 01:20:47.814
I bet if you had to play,

01:20:47.816 --> 01:20:49.518
you'd see things a
little differently.

01:20:50.719 --> 01:20:51.818
Hm.

01:20:51.820 --> 01:20:54.523
Lucky for me,
then, that I don't.

01:20:56.292 --> 01:20:57.360
Lucky for you.

01:21:01.163 --> 01:21:02.065
So?

01:21:04.933 --> 01:21:06.668
So, what?

01:21:07.370 --> 01:21:08.838
What was the outcome
of that round?

01:21:10.839 --> 01:21:11.708
Oh.

01:21:14.442 --> 01:21:15.511
Nothing.

01:21:16.311 --> 01:21:17.179
What?

01:21:17.846 --> 01:21:20.247
No players were eliminated.

01:21:20.249 --> 01:21:23.086
It happens, more often
than you might think.

01:21:31.192 --> 01:21:32.061
Something wrong?

01:21:33.094 --> 01:21:33.963
No.

01:21:34.163 --> 01:21:35.628
Really?

01:21:35.630 --> 01:21:37.831
Because you look like
every other dumb prick

01:21:37.833 --> 01:21:39.701
I've seen blow their brains out.

01:21:41.203 --> 01:21:42.705
You ever see anybody win?

01:21:45.907 --> 01:21:46.674
Not a one.

01:21:46.676 --> 01:21:47.843
Then I'm due.

01:21:48.776 --> 01:21:52.047
See, it's kinda like the
lottery, somebody's got to win.

01:21:55.651 --> 01:21:57.854
Except when they don't.

01:22:03.359 --> 01:22:05.524
Every time you
spin that cylinder,

01:22:05.526 --> 01:22:06.760
there are four
chances out of five

01:22:06.762 --> 01:22:08.731
that that bullet won't come up.

01:22:13.368 --> 01:22:14.469
That's true.

01:22:18.973 --> 01:22:21.143
Let's see if now is
one of those times.

01:22:35.423 --> 01:22:37.291
I think I got you on this one.

01:22:37.293 --> 01:22:41.164
No, seriously, I
feel good about this.

01:22:44.532 --> 01:22:45.567
Go on.

01:22:58.579 --> 01:22:59.648
Do you feel it?

01:23:00.414 --> 01:23:01.450
This is it.

01:23:06.989 --> 01:23:07.857
Am I right?

01:23:15.330 --> 01:23:16.531
I think I have you.

01:23:17.665 --> 01:23:19.468
Come on, take the position.

01:23:25.507 --> 01:23:26.576
Yeah.

01:23:27.575 --> 01:23:28.944
This is the one.

01:23:30.612 --> 01:23:32.013
You ready to say goodbye?

01:23:33.315 --> 01:23:34.217
Say it.

01:23:35.182 --> 01:23:36.183
Say goodbye.

01:23:36.185 --> 01:23:36.986
Say it.

01:23:37.585 --> 01:23:38.685
Fuck you.

01:23:38.687 --> 01:23:40.586
Pull the fucking trigger.

01:23:58.807 --> 01:24:01.777
No players eliminated.

01:24:13.321 --> 01:24:16.323
You think they're enjoying
this as much as you are?

01:24:16.325 --> 01:24:18.760
Maybe, probably more.

01:24:19.393 --> 01:24:21.228
You know, you last as
long as you say you will,

01:24:21.230 --> 01:24:23.665
you're gonna make
someone a lot of money.

01:24:25.100 --> 01:24:26.933
And that's why
they're doing this?

01:24:26.935 --> 01:24:29.869
Sure, I told you, gamblers
will bet on anything.

01:24:29.871 --> 01:24:31.338
This is the best game in town.

01:24:32.339 --> 01:24:35.076
So they're putting money
down on me right now?

01:24:36.410 --> 01:24:39.915
Even as we speak, they're
betting against you.

01:24:43.518 --> 01:24:46.155
Some are betting for you.

01:24:47.389 --> 01:24:51.024
They're betting to see how
many rounds this will go on,

01:24:51.026 --> 01:24:53.062
whether we'll have
a winner or not.

01:24:55.498 --> 01:24:56.996
Whether what?

01:24:56.998 --> 01:24:58.530
Sure, maybe one of these times,

01:24:58.532 --> 01:24:59.800
all the players are eliminated.

01:24:59.802 --> 01:25:00.870
It's possible.

01:25:01.902 --> 01:25:03.336
But the odds of that happening...

01:25:03.338 --> 01:25:05.775
Are 50/50, either it
happens or it doesn't.

01:25:08.544 --> 01:25:10.179
But that's not how odds work.

01:25:15.183 --> 01:25:16.052
It's time.

01:25:33.134 --> 01:25:34.070
Pick it up.

01:26:38.532 --> 01:26:40.402
No players were eliminated.

01:26:50.745 --> 01:26:52.578
You know what I think?

01:26:52.580 --> 01:26:54.980
I think your daughter
would be better off

01:26:54.982 --> 01:26:58.020
with no money and you dead

01:26:59.789 --> 01:27:03.793
than rich with a
crazy bitch like you.

01:27:08.696 --> 01:27:09.964
No.

01:27:10.164 --> 01:27:11.032
No?

01:27:14.270 --> 01:27:15.303
She needs me.

01:27:20.241 --> 01:27:22.378
She needs to know
what love really is.

01:27:24.914 --> 01:27:27.049
She needs to know
what it looks like.

01:27:29.852 --> 01:27:31.818
She needs someone to
help her understand

01:27:31.820 --> 01:27:33.054
that she deserves it.

01:27:36.023 --> 01:27:37.927
And that someone is you?

01:27:41.696 --> 01:27:43.132
You just figured this out?

01:27:44.566 --> 01:27:45.735
Yeah, I did.

01:27:47.803 --> 01:27:49.438
Well, then this
wasn't a total waste.

01:27:49.937 --> 01:27:51.005
Guess not.

01:27:55.910 --> 01:27:58.114
You know what I'm
gonna do after this?

01:27:59.347 --> 01:28:00.381
Drown a puppy?

01:28:03.319 --> 01:28:06.489
I think I'll go
find your daughter.

01:28:15.030 --> 01:28:16.766
That one got you, didn't it?

01:28:22.471 --> 01:28:24.037
Tell me, how have
you made it this far

01:28:24.039 --> 01:28:25.840
without someone killing you?

01:28:27.241 --> 01:28:29.145
Just my luck, I guess.

01:28:31.812 --> 01:28:32.882
Oh.

01:28:37.852 --> 01:28:39.522
There's been a change of plans.

01:28:42.222 --> 01:28:47.159
Seems the longevity
of the current players

01:28:47.161 --> 01:28:50.900
has made the people upstairs
change the rules around.

01:29:09.116 --> 01:29:11.020
Now what do your odds look like?

01:29:16.057 --> 01:29:16.924
It's not fair.

01:29:17.825 --> 01:29:20.895
All the other players have
the exact same challenge.

01:29:21.730 --> 01:29:23.598
- No one said...
- Said what?

01:29:24.767 --> 01:29:26.902
You didn't practice for this?

01:29:31.472 --> 01:29:32.340
I'll be sure

01:29:34.508 --> 01:29:35.844
to tell her

01:29:38.646 --> 01:29:39.915
you said hi.

01:29:50.023 --> 01:29:51.093
Pick it up.

01:29:55.931 --> 01:29:56.962
Come on.

01:29:56.964 --> 01:29:58.132
You know the drill.

01:30:47.581 --> 01:30:48.717
How many are left?

01:30:49.218 --> 01:30:50.252
How many what?

01:30:51.719 --> 01:30:53.088
Players?

01:30:54.021 --> 01:30:55.957
Someone has to have
been eliminated.

01:30:57.624 --> 01:30:58.960
Oh, yeah, that.

01:31:00.728 --> 01:31:02.630
One player was eliminated...

01:31:06.368 --> 01:31:07.535
as far as you know.

01:31:12.606 --> 01:31:13.907
What do you mean?

01:31:13.909 --> 01:31:15.675
I mean, as far as you know

01:31:15.677 --> 01:31:17.679
it's just you and
one other player.

01:31:20.382 --> 01:31:21.616
I don't understand.

01:31:24.152 --> 01:31:25.484
Then let me explain it to you.

01:31:25.486 --> 01:31:27.054
All that you know
about this game

01:31:27.056 --> 01:31:28.691
is what I've been
telling you, right?

01:31:30.592 --> 01:31:34.226
So, what if I told you
I've been making up

01:31:34.228 --> 01:31:36.097
these last couple of rounds?

01:31:39.101 --> 01:31:43.472
What if I told you
you've already won?

01:31:46.708 --> 01:31:50.212
Kinda funny if you
think about it.

01:31:51.745 --> 01:31:54.282
What if you're the only
one playing the game?

01:32:00.722 --> 01:32:01.887
That wouldn't work.

01:32:01.889 --> 01:32:03.325
How would you bet on that?

01:32:04.558 --> 01:32:07.195
Maybe the bet's not
about who wins the game.

01:32:07.896 --> 01:32:09.528
Maybe you're the bet,

01:32:09.530 --> 01:32:11.797
and it's simply how many times

01:32:11.799 --> 01:32:14.535
you'll keep pulling that
trigger until you lose.

01:32:16.637 --> 01:32:17.505
Think about it.

01:32:19.173 --> 01:32:21.474
How would you know?

01:32:28.182 --> 01:32:30.618
I'm kidding, yeah, of course.

01:32:31.652 --> 01:32:33.854
One of the other players
really was eliminated.

01:32:33.856 --> 01:32:36.122
That leaves you and one more.

01:32:38.226 --> 01:32:40.029
And it's that time again.

01:32:44.999 --> 01:32:47.069
So there really
is another player?

01:32:47.768 --> 01:32:49.168
I was just joking.

01:32:49.170 --> 01:32:51.470
Jeez, you got to learn
how to lighten up.

01:32:55.677 --> 01:32:58.679
If the player could take
their position, please?

01:33:03.985 --> 01:33:05.219
There really is another player?

01:33:05.553 --> 01:33:06.422
Yes.

01:33:07.289 --> 01:33:08.357
Prove it.

01:33:09.691 --> 01:33:11.024
Hold on a sec.

01:33:11.026 --> 01:33:12.461
Assume the position!

01:33:13.128 --> 01:33:14.663
Prove that there's
another player.

01:33:16.196 --> 01:33:17.930
That's not how this game works.

01:33:17.932 --> 01:33:19.133
You got to trust me.

01:33:27.875 --> 01:33:28.709
Ready.

01:33:41.054 --> 01:33:45.326
Pull the trigger.

01:33:51.065 --> 01:33:52.167
Do it!

01:34:03.846 --> 01:34:09.218
I've been instructed that
if you fail to comply again,

01:34:10.151 --> 01:34:11.386
you forfeit the game.

01:34:15.690 --> 01:34:16.592
Forfeit?

01:34:22.597 --> 01:34:24.600
Then I'm instructed
to shoot you.

01:34:28.870 --> 01:34:30.339
Your bosses,

01:34:32.507 --> 01:34:34.676
money is just their
excuse for playing.

01:34:35.843 --> 01:34:37.879
They don't really
care about winning.

01:34:39.513 --> 01:34:41.249
They just want to see blood.

01:34:42.517 --> 01:34:44.216
Now you're catching on.

01:34:44.218 --> 01:34:45.888
And they don't care whose it is.

01:34:47.955 --> 01:34:49.020
Oh.

01:34:49.022 --> 01:34:51.560
And we're upping the ante again.

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.905
You forgot to say whether
a player was eliminated.

01:35:05.807 --> 01:35:06.872
Did I?

01:35:06.874 --> 01:35:07.743
Hm.

01:35:09.076 --> 01:35:12.213
What if I told you there
wasn't really a game?

01:35:14.482 --> 01:35:18.920
What if I told you this
whole thing was just made up?

01:35:22.089 --> 01:35:26.395
What if I told you it's been
you and me this whole time?

01:35:37.972 --> 01:35:38.940
You're a liar.

01:35:40.307 --> 01:35:42.909
Well, I guess we'll find out.

01:35:48.482 --> 01:35:49.551
It's time.

01:35:52.053 --> 01:35:53.288
Position.

01:35:55.990 --> 01:35:56.824
Please.

01:35:59.994 --> 01:36:00.862
Mm-hm.

01:36:02.763 --> 01:36:03.632
You got it.

01:36:18.213 --> 01:36:20.315
Let me ask you this.

01:36:21.816 --> 01:36:24.986
What if there is just one bet?

01:36:27.454 --> 01:36:29.457
What if it's a 50/50 one?

01:36:32.627 --> 01:36:34.463
That wouldn't make any sense.

01:36:59.954 --> 01:37:00.988
You know what?

01:37:03.391 --> 01:37:05.427
I think I have already won.

01:37:12.999 --> 01:37:17.938
I think the bet now is simply
who walks out of this room.

01:37:20.075 --> 01:37:21.343
That's not how this
game is played.

01:37:21.676 --> 01:37:23.074
You said it yourself,

01:37:23.076 --> 01:37:25.379
real gamblers will
make odds on anything.

01:37:30.285 --> 01:37:33.418
What if I told you that gun
doesn't have any bullets?

01:37:35.123 --> 01:37:36.354
I watched you.

01:37:36.356 --> 01:37:38.024
Dummies, blanks.

01:37:38.026 --> 01:37:41.063
The real bet was to see how
long you'd play before you quit.

01:37:42.763 --> 01:37:43.632
Liar.

01:37:45.900 --> 01:37:47.367
Okay.

01:37:47.369 --> 01:37:48.603
Okay, you're right.

01:37:51.739 --> 01:37:55.811
It wasn't fair, so
just put the gun down,

01:37:57.111 --> 01:37:58.644
and we'll talk about
changing the rules.

01:37:58.646 --> 01:38:00.481
You're gonna change the rules?

01:38:01.949 --> 01:38:02.814
Sure.

01:38:02.816 --> 01:38:03.650
Why not?

01:38:04.752 --> 01:38:07.121
Guys like you don't
get to make the rules.

01:38:17.731 --> 01:38:19.700
Do you know what
your mistake was?

01:38:21.736 --> 01:38:25.537
You thought that the
show was all about me,

01:38:25.539 --> 01:38:28.909
but you forgot that there
are two animals in this cage.

01:38:32.146 --> 01:38:34.850
You won't get it out
before I pull the trigger.

01:38:38.753 --> 01:38:42.023
If that chamber's
empty, I got you.

01:38:43.490 --> 01:38:45.025
I thought they were blanks.

01:38:47.161 --> 01:38:48.597
You don't have the guts.

01:41:19.112 --> 01:41:20.412
Help me.

01:41:20.414 --> 01:41:21.282
Help me.

01:41:24.384 --> 01:41:25.286
Please.

01:41:27.187 --> 01:41:29.590
I have a son.

01:41:34.962 --> 01:41:38.633
Believe me, he's
better off without you.

01:43:20.567 --> 01:43:22.036
<i>You win.</i>
