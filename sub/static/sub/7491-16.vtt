00:02.542 --> 00:04.583
Ah, here it is, Mika.

00:04.667 --> 00:07.667
This is the place where I got
my black belt and beat down Jack.

00:09.041 --> 00:10.041
Oh, hey, Jack.

00:12.750 --> 00:15.083
- Uh, we should probably go, Mika.
- No, no, no, no.

00:15.166 --> 00:17.291
Why don't you show her
how you beat me down?

00:17.667 --> 00:18.875
Uh, see, I...

00:18.959 --> 00:21.083
The thing is I don't,
I don't really remember.

00:21.166 --> 00:24.542
Oh, I do. First, he got me in an arm lock.

00:24.625 --> 00:26.125
Like this.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.917
Then he gave you a front snap kick.

00:32.083 --> 00:34.917
- Oh!
- And then he flipped you.

00:35.000 --> 00:36.000
Wait, what?
No!

00:39.417 --> 00:43.166
Wow, you're very excellent fighter, Jerry.

00:44.291 --> 00:46.709
Hey, Bobby's on his way over here.

00:46.792 --> 00:48.625
- Oh!
- Ooh!

00:48.709 --> 00:50.667
What is this Bobby?

00:50.750 --> 00:52.834
Oh, he's the rich guy who owns the dojo.

00:52.917 --> 00:56.417
Whenever he visits, he makes
the most insane over-the-top entrances.

01:05.583 --> 01:08.000
Okay, not one of his best.

01:08.583 --> 01:11.500
Bobby? What's the matter?

01:11.583 --> 01:13.125
I'm lonely!

01:16.041 --> 01:18.750
But why are you lonely?
Do you not have a girlfriend?

01:18.834 --> 01:20.458
Excuse me!

01:20.542 --> 01:23.709
I am Bobby Wasabi.

01:23.750 --> 01:26.000
And no, I have no girlfriend.

01:27.500 --> 01:30.250
Wait, well, that's it.
That's what you need.

01:30.291 --> 01:32.458
I'm gonna help you find a girlfriend.

01:32.542 --> 01:36.041
- You will?
- Trust me, Bobby. I got your back.

01:36.125 --> 01:38.125
Because if there's one thing I know...

01:39.125 --> 01:41.834
It's how to deal with
the crushing blow of loneliness.

01:43.291 --> 01:46.041
It is Tuesday. Come to falafel Phil's.

01:46.125 --> 01:47.375
It is singles' night.

01:47.458 --> 01:50.000
Ohh...

01:50.083 --> 01:51.333
Falafel.

01:52.750 --> 01:56.083
Forget falafel!
We are gonna find you a lady.

01:56.166 --> 01:57.417
And how hard could it be?

01:57.500 --> 02:01.000
You're smart, an ex-movie star,
and really really--

02:01.083 --> 02:02.208
Handsome.

02:02.625 --> 02:03.917

Jerry, I don't know how to do this.

03:10.333 --> 03:13.792
Oh, come on. You just gotta be smooth.

03:13.875 --> 03:16.083
Uh... Yo, check it.

03:20.375 --> 03:21.458
What it do, girl?

03:25.959 --> 03:27.500
You see that?

03:27.583 --> 03:29.041
- Ah.
- All right, your turn.

03:29.166 --> 03:31.083
Yo, try that girl in the purple dress.

03:31.166 --> 03:32.166
<i>Go!</i>

03:32.250 --> 03:33.959
Yo, check it.

03:42.375 --> 03:43.875
What it do, girl?

03:43.959 --> 03:46.792
Um, what does what do?

03:52.542 --> 03:55.125
Quick question, what exactly is "it"

03:55.208 --> 03:56.834
and what is it that "it" do?

03:58.291 --> 04:00.333
Guys, great news!

04:00.417 --> 04:02.125
This woman Leona came into the dojo

04:02.208 --> 04:03.834
and she's a huge martial arts fan.

04:03.917 --> 04:06.041
She insisted on meeting you
right away, Bobby.

04:06.125 --> 04:08.041
- Really?
- You're gonna love her.

04:08.125 --> 04:09.709
She even has her own ninjas.

04:09.792 --> 04:11.000
Oh!

04:24.709 --> 04:27.625
Hello, Bobby. I'm Leona.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.792
What it do, Leona?

04:30.291 --> 04:33.208
You're what it do, Bobby.

04:34.583 --> 04:37.166
You hear that? Apparently I am what it do.

04:37.250 --> 04:38.667
Ha!

04:42.458 --> 04:44.083
You lock the wrist--

04:46.583 --> 04:48.083
What is that noise?

04:50.667 --> 04:53.959
It's a giant flock of doves lowering Bobby
into the courtyard.

04:54.041 --> 04:55.291
That sounds about right.

04:56.125 --> 04:57.875
Lower, my doves!

04:57.959 --> 04:59.166
Lower.

05:02.250 --> 05:04.375
There like a thousand doves up there.

05:04.458 --> 05:06.959
Oh, actually, it's 1500.

05:07.041 --> 05:09.458
I haven't been a thousand doves
since high school.

05:10.959 --> 05:12.875
I take it the date went well.

05:12.959 --> 05:16.333
Oh... You might say that.

05:16.625 --> 05:19.000
In two days, I am...

05:19.500 --> 05:21.709
getting married!

05:21.792 --> 05:23.000
What?
- No way.

05:23.083 --> 05:24.667
Bobby, this is crazy.

05:24.750 --> 05:26.291
You can't just jump into
something like this.

05:26.375 --> 05:27.667
Absolutely not.

05:27.792 --> 05:29.458
There are a lot of decisions to make.

05:29.542 --> 05:32.625
- The music, the invitations.
- The flowers, the food.

05:32.709 --> 05:35.083
Where to sit that crazy aunt
that smells like ham.

05:35.166 --> 05:38.291
Excuse me, I do not have an aunt
that smells like ham.

05:39.709 --> 05:41.125
Yeah, you do.

05:42.792 --> 05:44.542
Well, Milton, Mika,

05:44.625 --> 05:46.250
you will plan my wedding.

05:46.834 --> 05:49.166
And I can sing. Hey, I've done a lot of--

05:49.250 --> 05:51.291
Bah bah bah bah bah bah.
Not gonna happen, Eddie.

05:51.375 --> 05:53.917
- We're hiring a professional.
- Come on, Milton. Who do you really--

05:54.000 --> 05:55.792
Don't make me "bah bah bah" you again.

05:56.375 --> 05:59.000
Bobby, you can't just marry
the first woman

05:59.083 --> 06:00.834
who gives you any attention.

06:00.917 --> 06:02.750
I mean, I haven't even met her.

06:02.834 --> 06:04.959
Oh well, that's a shame

06:05.041 --> 06:08.709
because I was going to ask
if you'd be my best man.

06:08.792 --> 06:10.250
I accept!

06:10.333 --> 06:11.750
We're getting married!

06:11.834 --> 06:14.125
Yay!

06:19.667 --> 06:21.250
Come on, people! Let's move it!

06:21.291 --> 06:22.834
The wedding is in three hours.

06:22.917 --> 06:24.959
You, sweep under those tables.

06:25.041 --> 06:27.041
You, fix those napkins.

06:27.125 --> 06:29.959
And you, I told you
I didn't want you in here.

06:30.041 --> 06:31.542
You have one of those...

06:31.625 --> 06:33.250
"stay in the kitchen" kind of faces.

06:33.959 --> 06:35.291
Now let's go!

06:37.834 --> 06:39.667
What happened to the shrimp puffs?

06:39.750 --> 06:41.500
I put whole tray out here.

06:41.583 --> 06:45.000
Wait, do you mean the bay shrimp wrapped
in a phyllo dough crust

06:45.083 --> 06:47.291
tied together with baby asparagus spears?

06:47.375 --> 06:49.583
- Yes.
- Haven't seen 'em.

06:54.000 --> 06:57.083
"Bobby, I may be the best man,
But you're the

06:57.166 --> 06:59.375
best... man."

07:00.709 --> 07:03.542
Wait for applause,
wink at a cute bridesmaid.

07:08.208 --> 07:10.750
Oh... Beautiful lady legs.

07:11.959 --> 07:14.166
I wonder if they're attached to a...

07:15.375 --> 07:16.750
Oh, they are!

07:18.625 --> 07:20.333
Hello, beautiful lady.

07:20.417 --> 07:22.208
You got a little shrimp puff right here.

07:22.291 --> 07:25.667
Oh! Thanks for un-puffing me.

07:25.750 --> 07:27.041
My pleasure.

07:29.500 --> 07:31.458
You know, I gotta tell you...

07:32.041 --> 07:35.375
You have got the most amazing eyes.

07:36.291 --> 07:37.667
Thank you.

07:38.041 --> 07:40.542
I think they are spectacular.

07:40.625 --> 07:41.875
They are?

07:42.291 --> 07:43.917
You know, I have my mom's eyes.

07:44.583 --> 07:46.542
Not like in a box or a drawer or anything.

07:46.625 --> 07:48.250
They're just the same color.

07:50.291 --> 07:51.875
Anywho...

07:53.875 --> 07:56.667
I think that your eyes are also rather...

07:56.750 --> 07:59.291
Spectacular.

08:00.875 --> 08:02.959
Aw, man, where'd she go?

08:03.709 --> 08:05.667
Beautiful lady!

08:05.959 --> 08:08.125
Eddie, we have hired
a professional singer.

08:08.208 --> 08:09.625
Give rest to it already.

08:09.709 --> 08:10.917
But when I sing in the shower,

08:11.000 --> 08:13.291
my mom says I have the voice of an angel.

08:13.542 --> 08:15.458
Well, when I plan a wedding in a shower,

08:15.542 --> 08:16.750
you can sing.

08:18.166 --> 08:19.750
Excuse me, Mika. What are you doing?

08:19.834 --> 08:23.041
Oh, making sure the table is strong enough
for the goat to dance on.

08:23.125 --> 08:26.083
No, no, no. There are no goats dancing
in American weddings, hon.

08:37.250 --> 08:38.667
You speak Hachmaki?

08:39.208 --> 08:40.542
Not a word.

08:43.500 --> 08:45.000
I have got to find that woman.

08:45.083 --> 08:46.417
She is the one!

08:46.500 --> 08:50.041
There is nothing on this green earth
that will keep me from making her mine.

08:50.125 --> 08:51.500
Oh, Rudy. There you are.

08:51.583 --> 08:53.458
I want you to meet my bride-to-be.

08:53.542 --> 08:55.375
The love of my life...

08:55.458 --> 08:57.291
Leona.

08:59.166 --> 09:01.000
No!

09:05.000 --> 09:06.709
Way!

09:07.709 --> 09:09.917
I am so happy for you.

09:10.709 --> 09:12.834
Till death? Wow!

09:13.834 --> 09:16.959
That's forever! And ever! And ever.

09:17.041 --> 09:18.959
And ever...

09:23.792 --> 09:25.208
Let's put these chairs over here.

09:25.834 --> 09:28.834
Hey, look at all this cool stuff
from Bobby's movies.

09:30.625 --> 09:33.291
Hey, what movie did Bobby wear
a wedding dress in?

09:33.375 --> 09:35.625
Those aren't his. They must be Leona's.

09:36.625 --> 09:39.125
Whoa! Dude, check this out!

09:39.208 --> 09:42.583
This is the glove Bobby wore
in his movie <i>A fistful of glove.</i>

09:42.667 --> 09:43.875
What?

09:44.000 --> 09:46.834
When he put this on,
his whole hand became weaponized.

09:46.917 --> 09:48.583
This button shot out numbing darts.

09:49.709 --> 09:51.250
<i>I know this is just a prop,</i>

09:51.291 --> 09:53.458
but wouldn't it be awesome
if this thing really worked?

09:53.542 --> 09:55.792
I think it does work, Jack.

09:56.959 --> 09:58.291
What are you talking about?

10:00.542 --> 10:02.417
I can't feel my legs.

10:02.500 --> 10:03.750
-
- Dude, hey!

10:03.834 --> 10:05.291
Dude, are you okay?

10:05.375 --> 10:07.041
Oh, yeah.
I'm good.

10:07.125 --> 10:08.792
-
- Jerry!

10:10.250 --> 10:12.542
Once Bobby Wasabi and I are married,

10:12.625 --> 10:15.875
I'll eliminate him
and all his money will be mine.

10:15.959 --> 10:20.291
Not so fast!

10:21.125 --> 10:22.166
Come on.

10:22.583 --> 10:23.750
You want to help?

10:25.250 --> 10:27.625
Don't move or I'll let you have...

10:27.834 --> 10:29.291
Ow!

10:30.041 --> 10:31.000
My bad.

10:31.250 --> 10:33.500
I just got stuck with something!

10:33.583 --> 10:36.166
- It's a numbing dart.
<i>Yeah.</i>

10:36.250 --> 10:38.208
I got hit too.

10:39.709 --> 10:41.417
We heard about your evil plan.

10:41.792 --> 10:43.500
Forget about that for a second.

10:43.583 --> 10:45.500
How long will my mouth be like this?

10:45.583 --> 10:47.875
I'm getting married today!

10:49.542 --> 10:51.583
Oh no. I'm hoping it's not too long.

10:51.709 --> 10:53.333
Just about an hour or so.

10:54.834 --> 10:55.959
Get them!

10:56.625 --> 10:58.709
I said get them!

10:59.291 --> 11:00.792
Hey, Jerry!

11:06.500 --> 11:08.375
You're not marrying Bobby
because you love him.

11:08.500 --> 11:10.250
You're marrying him to get to his money.

11:10.333 --> 11:12.333
Which I love.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.458
Some girls scrapbook.

11:16.542 --> 11:20.834
Others marry then eliminate
martial-arts millionaires.

11:21.792 --> 11:23.500
Don't get me wrong, I scrapbook too.

11:28.709 --> 11:30.583
Once Bobby puts this ring on,

11:30.667 --> 11:33.458
the black-widow venom
will soak into his skin

11:33.542 --> 11:37.041
and tonight he will go
to the big dojo in the sky.

11:37.125 --> 11:39.500
Oh wait...

11:39.917 --> 11:41.667
You're the black-belt widow.

11:41.750 --> 11:44.125
I've seen you on that show,
"America's worst people."

11:46.542 --> 11:49.417
What makes you think
Bobby would wear such a tacky piece...

11:49.500 --> 11:51.458
Can I see that for a second?

11:54.709 --> 11:56.041
Oh, he's a goner.

11:57.291 --> 11:58.709
Wait a minute.

11:59.083 --> 12:01.667
Why would you tell us
all the details of your evil plan?

12:01.750 --> 12:03.208
Because it doesn't matter.

12:03.291 --> 12:05.375
Once I take care of Bobby,

12:05.458 --> 12:08.250
my ninjas will take care of you.

12:14.083 --> 12:15.500
Was that your evil laugh?

12:15.583 --> 12:17.667
I know. It's not good, is it?

12:17.750 --> 12:20.083
Well, no. A good evil laugh starts
from your diaphragm.

12:20.166 --> 12:21.750
Try this.

12:27.500 --> 12:29.125
Ah! That's better.

12:29.208 --> 12:30.041
- Thank you.
- You see?

12:30.125 --> 12:31.750
- Jerry!
- What?

12:31.834 --> 12:33.792
Just trying to help her.
It's the woman's wedding day.

12:37.083 --> 12:38.750
I'm telling you, little shrimp puff,

12:39.542 --> 12:41.667
there was a spark between me and her.

12:41.750 --> 12:43.667
It was undeniable.

12:44.667 --> 12:46.208
But now I've lost everything.

12:47.208 --> 12:49.000
You're all I have left.

12:54.458 --> 12:57.917
Oh, no! Now I'm all alone!

13:01.959 --> 13:03.625
Are you still crying to the shrimp puffs

13:03.709 --> 13:05.959
- about the woman you lost?
- Yes.

13:07.542 --> 13:09.792
If you're so brokenhearted
about this woman,

13:09.875 --> 13:12.166
why don't you just find her
and tell her how you feel?

13:12.792 --> 13:14.250
Because my fair maiden

13:14.333 --> 13:16.000
is betrothed to another.

13:17.875 --> 13:19.709
She can pick whoever she wants.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.291
But you'll never forgive yourself

13:21.417 --> 13:22.917
if you don't tell her
what's in your heart.

13:23.250 --> 13:24.583
You know what, Eddie?

13:24.875 --> 13:26.917
You're right. I'm gonna do it.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.083
I'm gonna find her
and tell her how I feel.

13:29.166 --> 13:30.375
Go on.

13:30.709 --> 13:32.625
Where in the heck is the wedding singer?

13:32.709 --> 13:34.500
I fired him and hired Eddie.

13:35.333 --> 13:38.041
- What?!
- He broke me down.

13:44.208 --> 13:46.625
Well, there goes
my wedding planning career.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.875
Might as well smash the ice sculptures,

13:49.959 --> 13:51.291
throw the plates against the wall

13:51.375 --> 13:54.542
and let a pack of wild hyenas
chase the crowd into the pool.

13:54.625 --> 13:57.291
Now, that's a wedding.

14:02.750 --> 14:04.041
Yo, Jack.

14:04.375 --> 14:06.959
Jack, I'm tied up,
so you have to go warn Bobby.

14:07.041 --> 14:09.875
I'm tied to you, you lug nut.

14:12.875 --> 14:15.583
I've got it! We'll do what Bobby
did when he was tied

14:15.875 --> 14:18.291
to Tommy Tsunami in his movie
<i>Samurai fist party.</i>

14:18.375 --> 14:20.542
Ohh... I didn't see that movie.

14:20.625 --> 14:22.542
Just stand up.

14:36.959 --> 14:38.834
Look what I did!

14:38.917 --> 14:40.667
Hey, next time try
and help out a little, Jack.

14:40.750 --> 14:42.166
Come here!

14:42.750 --> 14:44.458
Yo, we took out that guy,

14:44.542 --> 14:46.208
but Leona's ninjas are everywhere.

14:46.291 --> 14:47.792
How are we gonna get to Bobby?

14:52.125 --> 14:53.792
There might be one way.

14:56.041 --> 14:57.792
Would you be willing to wear this dress?

14:58.667 --> 15:00.041
I don't know.

15:00.125 --> 15:01.917
Think I've got the goods to pull it off?

15:22.375 --> 15:23.625
Jack and Jerry are missing,

15:23.709 --> 15:25.625
the toilet's clogged up with a shoe

15:25.709 --> 15:27.417
and Eddie's about to start singing.

why these two should not be wed,

17:04.875 --> 17:07.583
speak now or forever hold your peace.

17:07.792 --> 17:10.208
Objection, your honor!

17:12.166 --> 17:15.834
I am in love with the woman
that Bobby Wasabi is about to marry!

17:15.917 --> 17:17.959
Rudy! What is the meaning of this?

17:18.041 --> 17:19.542
I'm sorry, Bobby.

17:20.667 --> 17:23.375
Leona, from the moment that I met you

17:23.458 --> 17:26.166
my heart has been beating like a bongo.

17:26.667 --> 17:28.709
I wanna spend
the rest of my life with you.

17:31.083 --> 17:32.458
Hairy knuckles and all.

17:33.792 --> 17:35.208
Leona...

17:36.250 --> 17:37.542
Will you marry me?

17:39.291 --> 17:41.625
Okay. Now that we know
where everyone stands,

17:41.709 --> 17:43.750
I will resume my duties as best man.

17:43.834 --> 17:45.166
Carry on.

17:47.250 --> 17:49.291
Leona, my love,

17:49.375 --> 17:52.250
I declare today, in front
of all these people,

17:52.333 --> 17:53.875
my eternal love.

17:53.959 --> 17:55.542
We shall forever be one,

17:55.625 --> 17:59.166
as I seal my vow with a kiss.

18:06.542 --> 18:07.834
She's all yours, Rudy.

18:07.917 --> 18:09.333
No way, Wasabi.

18:09.917 --> 18:12.208
Bobby, Leona's the black-belt widow.

18:12.291 --> 18:14.041
She wants to marry you
so she can get rid of you

18:14.125 --> 18:15.041
and steal all your money.

18:15.125 --> 18:16.500
- What?
-

18:16.959 --> 18:18.709

- Oh.
