WEBVTT

00:06.107 --> 00:08.476
Male voice:
PREVIOUSLY ON
"IN TREATMENT"...

00:08.576 --> 00:10.278
I LEFT HOME.

00:10.378 --> 00:12.246
YOU REALLY HELPED
ME WITH THAT IN OUR
LAST SESSION.

00:12.346 --> 00:16.217
YOU SHOWED ME
THAT LEAVING HOME WAS
MY OWN PERSONAL DECISION.

00:17.551 --> 00:19.320
COULD YOU BE MAD AT ME
FOR SOMETHING ELSE?

00:19.420 --> 00:21.355
- LIKE WHAT?
- BECAUSE I MET
A PATIENT OF YOURS.

00:21.455 --> 00:24.992
I GOT THE DATES WRONG
AND I ACCIDENTALLY
MET LAURA.

00:25.093 --> 00:28.329
- SHOULD I GO FOR HER?
- I CAN'T GIVE YOU
DATING TIPS, ALEX.

00:28.429 --> 00:31.699
SHE'S THE KIND
OF WOMAN THAT CAN
DRIVE A MAN INSANE.

00:31.799 --> 00:33.033
AM I RIGHT?

00:38.072 --> 00:40.374
- BYE, MELISSA.
- BYE. THANK YOU.

00:48.116 --> 00:49.550
I'M EARLY, HUH?

00:49.650 --> 00:53.254
YEAH, BUT IT'S OKAY.
IT'S NOT A PROBLEM.

00:53.354 --> 00:56.424
I WAS IN THE AREA AND I
DIDN'T WANT TO GO HOME AND HAVE
TO COME ALL THE WAY BACK.

00:56.524 --> 00:59.193
- IT'S OKAY.
- ARE YOU SURE?

00:59.293 --> 01:01.795
- YOU DON'T HAVE
THINGS TO DO?
- I'M SURE.

01:04.165 --> 01:07.034
OH, THIS IS FROM LAURA.

01:07.135 --> 01:10.338
I THINK IT'S A CHECK.
WHO KNOWS?

01:14.041 --> 01:16.377
( theme music playing )

01:32.560 --> 01:34.562
I'LL PAY YOU
FOR THE EXTRA TIME.

01:34.662 --> 01:37.398
- NO NEED,
IT'S OKAY.
- NO NO.

01:37.498 --> 01:40.534
I INSIST.
IT'S ANOTHER 20%?

01:40.634 --> 01:43.771
$30, HOLD ON.

01:58.219 --> 01:59.920
DO YOU FEEL BETTER NOW?

02:00.020 --> 02:01.955
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

02:02.055 --> 02:04.392
AFTER PAYING ME,
DO YOU FEEL BETTER?

02:04.492 --> 02:08.095
WHAT ARE YOU
TRYING TO SAY?

02:08.196 --> 02:10.331
I GUESS THAT I'M--

02:10.431 --> 02:12.700
I'M SURPRISED BY HOW MUCH
EFFORT YOU PUT INTO

02:12.800 --> 02:16.003
SHOWING YOUR CONTEMPT
FOR THIS PROCESS
AND FOR ME.

02:16.103 --> 02:18.406
RELAX, OKAY?

02:18.506 --> 02:20.541
IT'S JUST THE WAY
MY MOTHER RAISED ME.

02:20.641 --> 02:22.243
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT'S LIKE
WITH YOU PEOPLE.

02:22.343 --> 02:24.878
I DON'T LIKE CHARITY,
SO I LIKE TO PAY
FOR WHAT I GET.

02:24.978 --> 02:28.349
WELL, I'M GLAD
YOU'RE GETTING
SOMETHING HERE, ALEX.

02:28.449 --> 02:30.351
LISTEN, LET'S NOT
MAKE A BIG DEAL OUT
OF THIS, OKAY?

02:30.451 --> 02:33.187
I MEAN, YOU WANT
ME TO ADMIT THAT THIS
THERAPY IS WORTHWHILE?

02:33.287 --> 02:37.191
OKAY, I'LL ADMIT IT:
THIS THERAPY IS CHANGING
MY LIFE.

02:37.291 --> 02:40.361
HAPPY?
CAN WE DROP IT NOW?

02:40.461 --> 02:44.164
HOW MANY PATIENTS
DO YOU HAVE?

02:44.265 --> 02:46.834
- WHY IS THAT RELEVANT?
- I'M JUST CURIOUS.

02:46.934 --> 02:48.802
LIKE TODAY,
HOW MANY PATIENTS
HAVE YOU HAD ALREADY?

02:48.902 --> 02:50.304
WHY ARE YOU
ASKING ME THIS?

02:50.404 --> 02:51.772
'CAUSE I WANT TO KNOW
WHAT KIND OF MONEY YOU MAKE.

02:51.872 --> 02:53.307
OH.

02:53.407 --> 02:55.008
NOW, LET'S SAY
YOU HAVE EIGHT
PATIENTS A DAY,

02:55.108 --> 02:57.778
TIMES FIVE DAYS A WEEK,
$150 A POP.

02:59.046 --> 03:01.349
IT'S PRETTY GOOD
LIVING THERE, DOC.

03:01.449 --> 03:03.050
$24 GRAND A MONTH.

03:03.150 --> 03:06.220
- DO YOU WANNA
BUY ME OUT, ALEX?
- WHAT?

03:06.320 --> 03:09.056
WELL, $24,000 A MONTH
AND I'M ALL YOURS.

03:09.156 --> 03:11.659
AND YOU'LL BE MY
ONLY PATIENT.

03:16.364 --> 03:18.299
IT MUST BE HARD
FOR YOU TO BE IN
THIS POSITION,

03:18.399 --> 03:22.270
TO BE PERCEIVED
AS WEAK.

03:22.370 --> 03:26.474
AND YOU HAVE
THIS NEED TO REGAIN
YOUR STRENGTH.

03:26.574 --> 03:28.676
YOU BRING ME
A CHECK FROM LAURA.

03:28.776 --> 03:31.044
YOU'VE ASKED ME
ABOUT MY PATIENTS
AND MY INCOME.

03:31.144 --> 03:33.747
AND YOU'VE DONE EVERYTHING
YOU CAN TO PUT ME IN
MY LITTLE PLACE.

03:33.847 --> 03:35.249
DID I OFFEND YOU?

03:35.349 --> 03:40.053
NO, I'M KIND OF USED TO IT.

03:40.153 --> 03:43.123
BUT THEN ALL OUR SESSIONS
START OUT LIKE THAT,
DON'T THEY, ALEX?

03:43.223 --> 03:45.959
MAYBE I WAS EXPECTING
SOMETHING A LITTLE
DIFFERENT TODAY,

03:46.059 --> 03:49.663
MAYBE BECAUSE
YOU WERE EARLY

03:49.763 --> 03:52.666
OR BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN
ASKING AROUND ABOUT ME.

03:52.766 --> 03:54.802
DO YOU WANT ME
TO TELL YOU WHY
I WAS EARLY,

03:54.902 --> 03:57.338
OR DO YOU WANNA JUST
GO ON AND ON WITH
YOUR THEORIES?

03:58.339 --> 04:00.741
I'D LOVE TO HEAR.

04:02.910 --> 04:04.812
I WENT TO THE BASE TODAY.

04:04.912 --> 04:08.582
I THOUGHT I'D POP OVER
BEFORE MY SESSION HERE

04:08.682 --> 04:11.452
AND SAY HELLO
TO MY BOYS, YOU KNOW?

04:11.552 --> 04:14.087
WHEN I GOT TO THE GATE,
I REALIZED I FORGOT MY ID.

04:14.187 --> 04:15.523
NOW USUALLY THAT'S
NOT A BIG DEAL.

04:15.623 --> 04:19.226
BUT THERE'S A NEW GRUNT
AT THE GATE--

04:19.327 --> 04:21.795
SOME REAL
OKIE FROM MUSKOGEE.

04:21.895 --> 04:24.765
I TOLD HIM, "LOOK,
CALL THE BASE COMMANDER

04:24.865 --> 04:27.835
AND TELL HIM
THAT LIEUTENANT PRINCE
IS HERE."

04:27.935 --> 04:30.538
SO HE GOES IN THE BOOTH,
CALLS, COMES BACK
A MINUTE LATER,

04:30.638 --> 04:32.973
AND HE SAYS I'M NOT
ON THE APPROVED LIST.

04:33.073 --> 04:35.709
NOW OF COURSE

04:35.809 --> 04:37.978
THIS IS A REAL SENSITIVE
ISSUE THESE DAYS, AS YOU
CAN IMAGINE.

04:38.078 --> 04:41.148
STILL I SAID,
"TO HELL WITH THE LIST.
THIS IS WHAT YOU DO.

04:41.248 --> 04:44.685
YOU CALL DANA
THE SECRETARY, TELL HER
TO TALK TO THE COMMANDER,

04:44.785 --> 04:48.088
AND YOU TELL HIM
THAT LIEUTENANT ALEX
PRINCE JR.

04:48.188 --> 04:50.491
IS WAITING
AT THE GATE."

04:50.591 --> 04:52.125
SO HE GOES IN,
HE CALLS, HE COMES BACK,

04:52.225 --> 04:54.962
AND HE SAYS--

04:55.062 --> 04:58.699
HE SAYS, "I'M SORRY,
BUT THE COMMANDER IS
IN A MEETING."

04:58.799 --> 05:01.469
NOW MAYBE HE WAS
IN A MEETING AND HE
COULDN'T BE DISTURBED.

05:01.569 --> 05:05.439
OR MAYBE THEY WERE
STUFFING THEIR FACES
WITH DOUGHNUTS.

05:05.539 --> 05:07.708
OR MAYBE HE JUST
DIDN'T GIVE A FUCK.
I DON'T KNOW.

05:07.808 --> 05:09.877
I TOLD THAT GUARD,
I SAID, "LOOK, YOU TELL DANA

05:09.977 --> 05:13.046
IF SHE TOOK THE COMMANDER'S
COCK OUT OF HER FUCKING MOUTH
ONCE IN A WHILE,

05:13.146 --> 05:16.550
THEN MAYBE SHE COULD
HEAR BETTER."

05:16.650 --> 05:19.820
MAN, I WAS THIS
CLOSE TO KNOCKING THAT
MOTHERFUCKER OUT.

05:22.823 --> 05:25.359
ANYWAY, I DIDN'T GET IN
SO I LEFT.

05:25.459 --> 05:27.895
AND THAT IS WHY
I GOT HERE EARLY.

05:31.131 --> 05:33.367
OH.

05:35.268 --> 05:37.438
NOT AN EASY
EXPERIENCE.

05:37.538 --> 05:38.872
NO, IT'S BULLSHIT.

05:38.972 --> 05:40.741
AND NOW I GOTTA COME HERE
AND I GOTTA DEAL WITH THIS?

05:40.841 --> 05:42.810
I GOT YOU COMING
AT ME LIKE THIS?

05:46.213 --> 05:48.616
THAT WAS THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG.
MY SHITTY WEEK STARTED
ON SATURDAY.

05:48.716 --> 05:51.885
WHY? WHAT HAPPENED
ON SATURDAY?

05:51.985 --> 05:55.122
OKAY, WE'RE GONNA PRETEND HERE.
ALL RIGHT.

05:55.222 --> 05:57.591
WE CAN PRETEND.

05:57.691 --> 05:59.860
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

05:59.960 --> 06:02.863
DO I?

06:02.963 --> 06:05.633
I WISH YOU WOULD HAVE
WARNED ME ABOUT LAURA
LAST WEEK.

06:05.733 --> 06:08.836
IT WOULD HAVE SAVED US BOTH
A LOT OF HEARTACHE.

06:11.672 --> 06:13.941
I SLEPT WITH HER, OKAY?

06:14.041 --> 06:16.477
WITH LAURA.

06:16.577 --> 06:18.912
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED
ON SATURDAY.

06:19.012 --> 06:22.716
BUT I'M SURE YOU GOT
A FULL PLAY-BY-PLAY
FROM HER ALREADY.

06:29.690 --> 06:31.358
DID SHE OR DID SHE NOT
TALK TO YOU ABOUT IT?

06:31.459 --> 06:35.896
I'M NOT AT LIBERTY
TO DISCUSS MY PATIENTS
OR THEIR SESSIONS.

06:35.996 --> 06:37.565
NOW WHAT IS THAT?

06:37.665 --> 06:39.433
CODE LANGUAGE FOR
SHE DID DISCUSS IT,
BUT YOU WON'T TELL ME?

06:39.533 --> 06:41.502
ALEX, NO.

06:44.104 --> 06:46.073
OKAY.

06:50.177 --> 06:53.080
IT WAS PRETTY WEIRD.

06:53.180 --> 06:56.517
SHE CALLED TO ASK ME
IF I WANTED TO COME OVER
FOR DINNER.

06:56.617 --> 06:59.687
NO PROBLEM, RIGHT?

06:59.787 --> 07:02.189
SO WHEN I GOT TO HER PLACE,

07:02.289 --> 07:05.726
I LOOKED AT HER.

07:05.826 --> 07:07.595
YOU KNOW,
I LOOKED AT HOW
SHE WAS DRESSED.

07:07.695 --> 07:09.697
I LOOKED AT THE TABLE.
I LOOKED AT THE WINE.

07:09.797 --> 07:12.332
AND I REALIZED
THAT DINNER

07:12.432 --> 07:15.469
WAS OBVIOUSLY JUST
A CODE NAME FOR SEX.

07:15.569 --> 07:19.039
THIS WHOLE THING
WAS LIKE A RITUAL.

07:19.139 --> 07:20.574
A RITUAL?

07:20.674 --> 07:22.543
YEAH YEAH,
AND ALL THE RULES.

07:22.643 --> 07:24.545
FIRST, OF COURSE,
THERE'S THE MEAL.

07:24.645 --> 07:26.113
SHE DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
A COOK, RIGHT?

07:26.213 --> 07:28.616
BUT SHE MADE
A BIG EFFORT.

07:28.716 --> 07:31.051
FOR STARTERS,
SHE PREPARED HER
OWN SUSHI--

07:31.151 --> 07:34.454
CALIFORNIA ROLLS.
THEY WEREN'T THAT GREAT,
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH.

07:34.555 --> 07:36.824
- IT DIDN'T TASTE GOOD?
- NO--

07:36.924 --> 07:39.660
IT WAS JUST FOR SHOW.
DON'T YOU GET IT?

07:39.760 --> 07:42.630
THAT'S THE PROBLEM NOWADAYS,
EVERYTHING IS FOR SHOW.

07:42.730 --> 07:44.331
IF YOU WANNA MAKE SUSHI,
TAKE A FUCKING COURSE.

07:44.431 --> 07:46.133
GO TO A REAL
JAPANESE GROCERY.

07:46.233 --> 07:48.536
DON'T MAKE IT
WITH UNCLE BEN'S RICE
AND IMITATION CRABMEAT.

07:48.636 --> 07:51.905
- COME ON.
- DID YOU SAY
ANYTHING TO HER?

07:53.240 --> 07:55.576
OF COURSE NOT, NO.

07:55.676 --> 07:59.346
THE DINNER WAS
JUST A LEAD UP TO US
GETTING IN BED.

07:59.446 --> 08:02.082
I TOLD YOU THAT.
IT DIDN'T REALLY MATTER.

08:03.517 --> 08:06.286
SO DID YOU WANT
TO SLEEP WITH HER?

08:06.386 --> 08:09.122
YEAH,

08:09.222 --> 08:12.526
BUT IT HAS
NOTHING TO DO WITH
WANTING ANYTHING.

08:12.626 --> 08:14.427
IT WAS ALL PREMEDITATED.

08:14.528 --> 08:16.697
IT WAS LIKE
A MATING RITUAL,

08:16.797 --> 08:19.600
LIKE THE MASAI TRIBE
IN TANZANIA, BUT FOR YUPPIES.

08:19.700 --> 08:22.502
ANYWAY, YEAH, SO WE
GOT UP FROM THE TABLE,

08:22.603 --> 08:24.437
WE WENT TO HER BEDROOM
AND HAD SEX.

08:24.538 --> 08:27.675
AND THAT'S WHAT
HAPPENED ON SATURDAY.

08:28.976 --> 08:31.812
IT'S INTERESTING
THAT YOU TELL ME
SO MUCH

08:31.912 --> 08:35.282
ABOUT THIS RITUAL OF YOU
GOING TO BED TOGETHER,

08:35.382 --> 08:38.418
BUT NOTHING ABOUT

08:38.518 --> 08:41.955
WHAT HAPPENED
BETWEEN YOU.

08:42.055 --> 08:45.626
I'M SURE THAT YOU'VE HAD
LOUSY SUSHI BEFORE,

08:45.726 --> 08:48.729
BUT I DON'T THINK
YOU'VE BEEN WITH
ANOTHER WOMAN

08:48.829 --> 08:50.230
FOR A LONG TIME.
ISN'T THAT CORRECT?

08:50.330 --> 08:52.499
BUT YOU KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED.

08:52.600 --> 08:54.635
SO WHY DO YOU HAVE
TO HEAR IT FROM ME?

08:54.735 --> 08:57.170
YOU'RE VERY PREOCCUPIED
WITH WHO KNOWS WHAT

08:57.270 --> 08:59.707
AND WHO SAID WHAT.

08:59.807 --> 09:03.577
WHAT'S IMPORTANT
IS HOW YOU FELT ABOUT IT,

09:03.677 --> 09:06.980
HOW THE EXPERIENCE
WAS FOR YOU.

09:07.080 --> 09:08.982
THE SEX, HMM?

09:10.751 --> 09:13.420
THE SEX IS ALL
THAT ANYONE WANTS
TO TALK ABOUT.

09:13.520 --> 09:16.657
BUT IS IT REALLY
AS IMPORTANT AS YOU PEOPLE
MAKE IT OUT TO BE?

09:16.757 --> 09:19.960
WELL, YOU TELL ME.

09:20.060 --> 09:22.295
LOOK, I KNOW THAT'S
WHAT IT SAYS IN ALL
YOUR TEXTBOOKS.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.564
I KNOW THAT.
BUT I ASK MYSELF,

09:24.665 --> 09:26.767
"IS IT REALLY THE KEY
TO EVERYTHING?

09:26.867 --> 09:29.502
OR IS IT JUST
THE SIMPLEST ANSWER?"

09:29.603 --> 09:32.339
BUT YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO STARTED THE STORY

09:32.439 --> 09:34.574
BY SAYING THAT
THE SEX WAS THE ISSUE,

09:34.675 --> 09:37.845
THAT ALL THE REST
WAS JUST FOREPLAY.

09:37.945 --> 09:41.214
OKAY, I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT HAPPENED.

09:41.314 --> 09:44.584
OTHERWISE YOU WON'T
FEEL LIKE YOU'RE DOING
YOUR JOB, RIGHT?

09:49.289 --> 09:51.291
BUT BEFORE I START,

09:51.391 --> 09:53.193
THERE'S SOMETHING
I'VE GOTTA KNOW.

09:54.928 --> 09:57.931
DID YOU EVER JERK OFF
TO ANYTHING A PATIENT
TOLD YOU?

09:58.031 --> 09:59.066
WHAT?

09:59.166 --> 10:01.635
COME ON.

10:01.735 --> 10:04.938
COME ON, YOU MUST
HEAR SOME CRAZY STORIES
FROM WOMEN--

10:05.038 --> 10:08.842
EXPLICIT SHIT,
FANTASIES.

10:08.942 --> 10:10.543
DID YOU EVER
JERK OFF AFTERWARDS?

10:10.644 --> 10:13.881
ARE YOU CONCERNED
THAT I'LL MASTURBATE

10:13.981 --> 10:16.416
- TO SOMETHING THAT
YOU TELL ME, ALEX?
- ME? NO.

10:16.516 --> 10:18.919
I'M TALKING ABOUT
YOU'VE GOT WOMEN, THEY
SIT HERE ON YOUR COUCH.

10:19.019 --> 10:20.754
THEY TELL YOU
ALL ABOUT FUCKING.

10:20.854 --> 10:23.356
IT MUST GET TO YOU SOMETIMES.
I KNOW IT WOULD GET TO ME.

10:23.456 --> 10:25.225
DO YOU MASTURBATE?

10:25.325 --> 10:27.795
THERE YOU GO AGAIN,
YOU'RE ANSWERING A QUESTION
WITH A QUESTION.

10:27.895 --> 10:30.998
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL ANSWER WITH AN ANSWER.

10:31.098 --> 10:33.767
I'M A HUMAN BEING.
I MASTURBATE SOMETIMES.

10:33.867 --> 10:38.505
MY FANTASIES ARE ABOUT
MANY MANY THINGS,

10:38.605 --> 10:40.841
ALL SORTS OF WOMEN.

10:40.941 --> 10:42.542
IS THAT WHAT YOU
WANTED TO HEAR?

10:42.642 --> 10:45.979
THAT IN THAT REGARD
I'M NOT THAT SUBSTANTIALLY
DIFFERENT FROM YOU?

10:46.079 --> 10:49.182
THAT'S THE FIRST TIME
YOU'VE EVER ANSWERED ONE
OF MY QUESTIONS.

10:49.282 --> 10:51.251
IN ANY CASE,

10:51.351 --> 10:54.855
YOU WON'T MASTURBATE
TO ME AND LAURA'S STORY.
I GUARANTEE YOU THAT.

10:54.955 --> 10:57.657
IF ANYTHING, YOU MAY THINK
OF IT THE NEXT TIME YOU'RE
HAVING SEX WITH YOUR WIFE

10:57.758 --> 11:00.227
AND YOU'RE TRYING
NOT TO COME.

11:05.866 --> 11:08.836
IT MUST HAVE
BEEN A VERY...

11:08.936 --> 11:13.006
COMPLEX EXPERIENCE
FOR YOU

11:13.106 --> 11:15.208
BEING WITH--

11:15.308 --> 11:17.277
BEING WITH
ANOTHER WOMAN

11:17.377 --> 11:20.147
AFTER ALL THIS TIME.

11:20.247 --> 11:22.215
COMPLEX, RIGHT.

11:27.554 --> 11:29.689
I GAVE A SHITTY
PERFORMANCE.

11:29.790 --> 11:31.591
I MADE EVERY
POSSIBLE MISTAKE.

11:31.691 --> 11:34.795
I WAS A MESS,
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH.

11:38.866 --> 11:41.201
DURING DINNER,

11:41.301 --> 11:43.503
BEFORE WE HAD SEX,

11:43.603 --> 11:44.938
I STARTED THINKING
ABOUT MY FIRST DATE

11:45.038 --> 11:48.408
WITH MY WIFE MICHAELA
ABOUT 15 YEARS AGO.

11:50.744 --> 11:52.379
JESUS.

11:55.115 --> 11:57.084
WE HAD GONE OUT
TO THIS BAR TOGETHER,

11:57.184 --> 11:58.986
AND AT THE TIME
SHE WAS THE LIBERAL TYPE.

11:59.086 --> 12:00.854
YOU KNOW, SHE'D TALK
OPENLY ABOUT EVERYTHING--

12:00.954 --> 12:03.556
FOREPLAY,
FAVORITE POSITIONS,
CUDDLING AFTERWARDS--

12:03.656 --> 12:07.327
"COSMO" TYPE
BULLSHIT.

12:07.427 --> 12:09.462
AND AMONG OTHER THINGS,
SHE TOLD ME THAT
RESEARCHERS FOUND

12:09.562 --> 12:11.799
THAT WINE AROUSES
WOMEN SEXUALLY

12:11.899 --> 12:14.401
AND REPRESSES
MEN'S SEXUAL DESIRES.

12:14.501 --> 12:16.169
HAVE YOU EVER
HEARD THAT?

12:16.269 --> 12:18.271
- MM-HMM.
- YEAH, WELL, I DON'T
KNOW WHAT MADE ME DO IT,

12:18.371 --> 12:21.574
BUT AT ONE POINT
DURING MY CONVERSATION
WITH LAURA,

12:21.674 --> 12:24.644
WE HIT ONE OF THOSE
DEADLY SILENCES.

12:24.744 --> 12:27.580
I SUDDENLY TOLD HER

12:27.680 --> 12:31.151
THAT ALCOHOL SEXUALLY
REPRESSES MEN,

12:31.251 --> 12:33.720
WHILE WOMEN, IT--

12:33.821 --> 12:36.489
AND SHE-- OF COURSE,
SHE DIDN'T RESPOND.

12:36.589 --> 12:38.758
SHE JUST GAVE ME
ONE OF THOSE LOOKS

12:38.859 --> 12:41.328
SAYING, "WHY ARE YOU
TELLING ME THIS?"

12:41.428 --> 12:43.831
WHY DID YOU TELL HER?

12:43.931 --> 12:47.600
I DON'T KNOW.

12:47.700 --> 12:50.737
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE IT WAS A WAY

12:50.838 --> 12:53.273
TO MOVE THE CONVERSATION
IN A SEXUAL DIRECTION,

12:53.373 --> 12:54.975
MAKE THINGS GO FORWARD.

12:55.075 --> 12:57.911
A KIND OF SIGNAL
THAT SHE HAD BEEN
CLEARED TO ATTACK.

13:01.414 --> 13:03.416
IS THAT WHAT
YOU WANTED?

13:03.516 --> 13:05.919
FOR HER TO ATTACK?

13:06.019 --> 13:08.989
DO YOU THINK
THAT SHE UNDERSTOOD
THE SIGNAL?

13:09.089 --> 13:10.657
YEAH.

13:10.757 --> 13:12.525
IS THERE ANY OTHER WAY
OF UNDERSTANDING IT?

13:12.625 --> 13:16.563
WELL, IT MIGHT HAVE SOUNDED
LIKE AN APOLOGY IN ADVANCE

13:16.663 --> 13:18.899
THAT YOU DIDN'T
HAVE ANY

13:18.999 --> 13:22.936
REAL SEXUAL
DESIRE FOR HER.

13:23.036 --> 13:25.605
I DON'T THINK SO.
SHE WASN'T EVEN
TOO FAZED BY IT.

13:25.705 --> 13:28.475
SHE JUST CHANGED
THE SUBJECT RIGHT AWAY,

13:28.575 --> 13:30.677
LIKE I HAD SAID
SOMETHING NASTY,

13:30.777 --> 13:34.781
SOMETHING INAPPROPRIATE
AT THE TABLE WITH
ALL THAT SUSHI.

13:34.882 --> 13:36.917
AND THAT'S WHAT
PISSED ME OFF.

13:37.017 --> 13:39.119
LIKE ALL HER FAGGY
DOCTOR FRIENDS SHE
HANGS OUT WITH

13:39.219 --> 13:41.321
ALWAYS SAY EXACTLY
THE RIGHT THING.

13:41.421 --> 13:43.623
SO LISTEN, THE FIRST CHANCE
I GOT, I LOOKED HER RIGHT
IN THE EYE

13:43.723 --> 13:47.660
AND I SAID,
"BABY, I HAVE TO GO
TO THE BATHROOM.

13:47.760 --> 13:49.963
I'M A BIT NERVOUS.

13:50.063 --> 13:52.900
IT'S MY FIRST TIME
SINCE I LEFT MY WIFE."

13:53.000 --> 13:56.636
THIS TIME SHE COULD
BARELY SQUEEZE OUT A SMILE,

13:56.736 --> 13:59.039
EVEN A PHONY ONE.
AND FROM THEN ON,
EVERY FEW MINUTES,

13:59.139 --> 14:02.475
I'D MENTION MY WIFE
AND THE SEPARATION--
EVEN IN BED.

14:02.575 --> 14:05.578
I DID IT EVERY
CHANCE I GOT JUST
TO SEE HER SQUIRM.

14:07.747 --> 14:11.151
I THINK I GOT HER
COMPLETELY OUT
OF THE MOOD.

14:11.251 --> 14:13.053
SHE WAS TOTALLY
TURNED OFF.

14:17.790 --> 14:20.760
WE HAD SEX.

14:20.860 --> 14:23.997
IT WAS MORE LIKE
TWO ANIMALS MATING.

14:24.097 --> 14:25.498
I WASN'T THAT HARD

14:25.598 --> 14:28.768
AND I CAME PRETTY FAST.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.737
AND EVEN ON THE WAY
TO THE SHOWER

14:30.837 --> 14:33.673
I THREW IN ANOTHER
"I'M SORRY, IT WAS MY FIRST
TIME IN SO MANY YEARS,"

14:33.773 --> 14:35.909
JUST FOR DESSERT.

14:39.712 --> 14:43.516
I DON'T KNOW
WHY I KEPT SAYING IT.

14:46.386 --> 14:49.489
WERE YOU THINKING
ABOUT YOUR WIFE?

14:49.589 --> 14:51.091
NO.

14:51.191 --> 14:53.293
OR FEELING GUILTY MAYBE?

14:53.393 --> 14:54.894
NO, WHY WOULD I?

14:54.995 --> 14:59.132
WELL, BECAUSE ANY
OF THOSE REACTIONS WOULD
HAVE BEEN NATURAL, ALEX.

14:59.232 --> 15:02.669
WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT

15:02.769 --> 15:04.972
YOUR SEPARATION,
HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT IT.

15:05.072 --> 15:06.639
NO, THAT'S NOT
WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

15:06.739 --> 15:08.841
I TOLD YOU,
THE SEPARATION WAS
THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

15:08.942 --> 15:11.344
I HAVEN'T EVEN
LOOKED BACK ON THAT.
DON'T YOU GET OFF TOPIC.

15:11.444 --> 15:13.546
WHAT IS THE TOPIC?

15:15.482 --> 15:17.750
DO OUR STORIES MATCH,
ME AND LAURA'S?

15:17.850 --> 15:19.352
THAT'S WHAT
I WANT TO KNOW.

15:22.222 --> 15:24.992
LOOK, ON THE ONE HAND,
YOU DESCRIBE THIS FEELING

15:25.092 --> 15:27.727
OF HELPLESSNESS,
WEAKNESS,

15:27.827 --> 15:30.630
AS IF YOU WERE
DRAGGED INTO SEX

15:30.730 --> 15:33.100
AGAINST YOUR WILL.

15:34.301 --> 15:36.836
YOU FEEL THAT YOU DIDN'T
PERFORM TOO WELL,

15:36.936 --> 15:38.972
SO YOU FELT...

15:39.072 --> 15:41.374
SOMEWHAT HUMILIATED.

15:41.474 --> 15:45.812
THEN TO GAIN BACK
SOME STRENGTH
AND CONTROL,

15:45.912 --> 15:49.882
YOU MAKE THESE
REFERENCES TO YOUR WIFE

15:49.983 --> 15:52.252
IN ORDER
TO BELITTLE LAURA.

15:52.352 --> 15:54.054
BELITTLE HER?

15:54.154 --> 15:57.424
YOU REALLY MAKE SOME
PRETTY FAR-OUT CONNECTIONS.

15:57.524 --> 16:01.394
SHE BELITTLED ME.
HER WHOLE ATTITUDE IS--
IT'S PATRONIZING.

16:01.494 --> 16:03.096
YOU'RE SURE?

16:03.196 --> 16:05.898
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO SUDDENLY FELT WEAK,
SO YOU ATTACKED.

16:05.999 --> 16:09.202
YOU WANTED
TO REGAIN CONTROL.

16:09.302 --> 16:12.172
IT REMINDS ME OF
THE BEGINNING OF OUR SESSION
WHEN YOU CAME IN HERE.

16:12.272 --> 16:14.307
YOU WERE VULNERABLE
FROM WHAT HAPPENED
AT THE BASE.

16:14.407 --> 16:16.243
YOU GIVE ME
THE ENVELOPE FROM LAURA

16:16.343 --> 16:19.012
AND THEN YOU THROW
YOUR MONEY ON THE TABLE

16:19.112 --> 16:21.014
AS IF YOU WANTED
TO HUMILIATE ME,

16:21.114 --> 16:24.051
TO MAKE ME FEEL SMALL.

16:27.187 --> 16:28.188
HOW'S YOUR MACHINE?

16:28.288 --> 16:31.091
IT'S GOOD.
THANK YOU.

16:31.191 --> 16:34.094
ARE THE CLIENTS HAPPY?

16:36.396 --> 16:39.166
I'M GONNA MAKE ME SOME
COFFEE, BY THE WAY,
IF YOU WANT SOME.

16:39.266 --> 16:41.401
IF YOU'VE DECIDED
TO STOP BEING A TEA MAN.

16:41.501 --> 16:44.304
ALEX, CAN WE GET
BACK TO THIS, PLEASE?

16:44.404 --> 16:47.274
WE'RE ONTO
SOMETHING HERE

16:47.374 --> 16:48.741
AND I DON'T WANT
TO LOSE TRACK.

16:48.841 --> 16:53.146
JUST GIVE ME
A SECOND HERE, OKAY?

16:53.246 --> 16:56.015
I REALIZE
WE'RE ONTO SOMETHING.
I JUST NEED A BREAK.

16:56.116 --> 16:59.152
RESPECT THAT.

17:32.985 --> 17:35.922
I WANT YOU TO TELL
ME SOMETHING...

17:36.022 --> 17:38.191
HONESTLY.

17:44.897 --> 17:46.666
DO YOU REALLY THINK
YOU CAN HELP ME?

17:54.241 --> 17:56.509
I MEAN, IF WE SIT HERE

17:56.609 --> 17:59.212
AND WE TALK ABOUT FUCKING
A FEW TIMES...

18:01.581 --> 18:03.483
YOU'LL BE ABLE
TO SOLVE ALL MY PROBLEMS?

18:04.717 --> 18:07.820
I DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER
TO THAT QUESTION.

18:11.458 --> 18:13.593
YEAH, I KNEW
YOU'D SAY THAT.

18:13.693 --> 18:16.563
YOU KNOW,
THAT'S WHAT KILLS ME
ABOUT YOU PEOPLE.

18:16.663 --> 18:18.498
'CAUSE ANY
OTHER PROFESSIONAL--

18:18.598 --> 18:20.200
I GO TO A DOCTOR,
HE TAKES A LOOK

18:20.300 --> 18:22.302
AND HE SAYS,
"THIS IS WHAT YOU GOT.

18:22.402 --> 18:24.637
THIS IS HOW LONG
YOU HAVE TO LIVE."

18:24.737 --> 18:26.206
IF I WENT TO A MECHANIC,

18:26.306 --> 18:29.742
HE'D SAY,
"$2,000, IT'LL BE
GOOD AS NEW."

18:31.110 --> 18:33.846
BUT YOU PEOPLE,
YOU DON'T GUARANTEE SHIT.

18:39.752 --> 18:41.020
CAN I TELL YOU
A STORY?

18:41.120 --> 18:43.356
WHAT KIND OF STORY?

18:43.456 --> 18:47.294
IT'S A JEWISH PARABLE THAT
A FRIEND OF MINE TOLD ME.

18:50.062 --> 18:52.599
THESE TWO FRIENDS
ARE CONDEMNED TO DEATH,

18:52.699 --> 18:54.367
BUT THE KING--

18:54.467 --> 18:57.170
HE LIKED THEM
AND HE DIDN'T WANT
TO KILL THEM.

18:57.270 --> 18:59.539
SO INSTEAD, HE TIED

18:59.639 --> 19:03.243
A THIN ROPE
ACROSS THIS ABYSS

19:03.343 --> 19:05.645
AND HE TOLD THEM BOTH

19:05.745 --> 19:08.415
TO WALK OVER THE ROPE.

19:08.515 --> 19:11.117
WHOEVER MADE IT
TO THE OTHER SIDE

19:11.218 --> 19:12.519
WOULD BE ALLOWED
TO LIVE.

19:12.619 --> 19:16.456
SO THE FIRST ONE
WALKED OVER THE ROPE

19:16.556 --> 19:20.427
AND HE MAKES IT SAFELY
TO THE OTHER SIDE.

19:20.527 --> 19:23.696
AND AFTER HE MADE IT,
HIS FRIEND YELLS OUT TO HIM,

19:23.796 --> 19:25.732
"HOW DID YOU DO IT?"

19:27.066 --> 19:29.101
AND THE OTHER
GUY ANSWERED,

19:29.202 --> 19:32.605
"I HAVE NO IDEA.

19:32.705 --> 19:34.341
ALL I KNOW IS THAT

19:34.441 --> 19:38.745
WHENEVER MY WEIGHT
PULLED ME TO ONE SIDE...

19:40.179 --> 19:42.449
I LEANED TO THE OTHER."

19:50.557 --> 19:52.559
IT AIN'T EXACTLY
"LORD OF THE RINGS."

19:52.659 --> 19:54.727
( laughs )

19:54.827 --> 19:56.496
TRUE.

20:00.132 --> 20:01.768
SO WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

20:01.868 --> 20:03.970
THAT YOU HAVE TO MAINTAIN
BALANCE IN YOUR LIFE?

20:04.070 --> 20:06.873
I THINK WHAT IT MEANS

20:06.973 --> 20:10.543
IS THAT THERE ARE NO
SIMPLE WAYS OF JUMPING
OVER AN ABYSS

20:10.643 --> 20:13.380
OR WAYS THAT WORK
FOR EVERYONE.

20:13.480 --> 20:15.682
I THINK WHAT YOU'RE
LOOKING FOR, ALEX,

20:15.782 --> 20:19.586
IS A MILLION-DOLLAR
MAGIC TRICK, AND I DON'T
HAVE THAT.

20:20.687 --> 20:22.922
I TRULY BELIEVE
THERE IS NO SIMPLE WAY

20:23.022 --> 20:24.324
TO JUMP ACROSS AN ABYSS.

20:24.424 --> 20:26.726
INSTEAD, WE HAVE TO WORK

20:26.826 --> 20:29.962
IN SMALL INTERNAL STEPS.

20:31.197 --> 20:34.133
THE QUESTION IS WHETHER
YOU WANT US,

20:34.233 --> 20:36.569
YOU AND I,
TO ENGAGE IN THAT PROCESS.

20:40.039 --> 20:41.341
EYES ON YOUR INSTRUMENTS.

20:41.441 --> 20:43.576
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

20:43.676 --> 20:47.213
IT'S ONE OF THE BASIC
PRINCIPLES IN AVIATION.

20:47.314 --> 20:48.881
YOU EVER HEARD
OF VERTIGO?

20:48.981 --> 20:50.850
SURE.

20:50.950 --> 20:52.952
WHEN YOU GO
INTO VERTIGO

20:53.052 --> 20:54.954
YOUR DIRECTIONAL
PERCEPTION CHANGES.

20:55.054 --> 20:57.724
YOU'RE SPATIALLY
DISORIENTED.

20:57.824 --> 20:59.526
YOU'D BE FLYING
AT MACH 2 NOSE DOWN

20:59.626 --> 21:01.728
AND THINK YOU'RE
TAKING OFF.

21:01.828 --> 21:04.364
SO THAT'S THE FIRST
THING THEY TEACH YOU
AT PILOT SCHOOL.

21:04.464 --> 21:06.666
YOU GO INTO VERTIGO,

21:06.766 --> 21:09.736
YOU LOOK ONLY
AT YOUR AIRCRAFT'S
INSTRUMENTS.

21:09.836 --> 21:11.904
IGNORE YOUR
FEELINGS COMPLETELY.

21:12.004 --> 21:13.906
RELY ON YOUR INSTRUMENTS.

21:14.006 --> 21:16.175
THAT'S WHAT THE AIR CONTROLLER
TELLS YOU IF HE THINKS
YOU'RE FREAKING OUT,

21:16.275 --> 21:18.177
AND THAT'S WHAT
YOU'RE TELLING ME NOW.

21:18.277 --> 21:20.547
EYES ON YOUR INSTRUMENTS.

21:20.647 --> 21:25.051
SO YOU WANT ME TO PUT
MYSELF INTO YOUR HANDS.

21:25.151 --> 21:28.154
YOU WANNA NAVIGATE ME.
RELY ON YOU.

21:28.254 --> 21:30.690
AND ON ONE HAND,
YOU'RE RIGHT.

21:30.790 --> 21:32.492
I MEAN, THAT'S
WHY I CAME HERE IN
THE FIRST PLACE.

21:32.592 --> 21:36.929
BUT KEEPING MY EYES
ON THE INSTRUMENTS IS
WHAT GOT ME HERE.

21:37.029 --> 21:38.865
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

21:38.965 --> 21:41.033
BECAUSE I KEPT MY EYES
ON THE INSTRUMENTS,

21:41.133 --> 21:43.603
I DROPPED THAT BOMB
SO ACCURATELY INTO
THAT WINDOW.

21:43.703 --> 21:46.272
I RELIED ONLY
ON MY COMMANDERS

21:46.373 --> 21:49.709
AND I KILLED
INNOCENT PEOPLE.

21:54.581 --> 21:57.850
AND NOW I'M SUPPOSED
TO RELY ON YOU.

21:57.950 --> 22:00.520
ALEX, I DON'T WANT YOU
TO RELY ON ME.

22:00.620 --> 22:03.990
I WANT YOU
TO RELY ON YOURSELF,

22:04.090 --> 22:05.658
ON YOUR OWN FEELINGS.

22:05.758 --> 22:08.861
THE MOST I CAN
EVER BE TO YOU

22:08.961 --> 22:11.263
IS AN AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER

22:11.364 --> 22:14.734
WHO TELLS YOU TO TRY
TO IGNORE THE EXPECTATIONS
OF EVERYBODY ELSE.

22:14.834 --> 22:18.037
IT'S THE EXPECTATIONS
THAT GIVE YOU--

22:18.137 --> 22:19.839
THAT GIVE YOU VERTIGO.

22:30.149 --> 22:32.184
WHAT'S THE FIRST STEP

22:32.284 --> 22:34.253
ON THE WAY
TO MY NEW LIFE?

22:34.353 --> 22:36.623
WELL, WHAT WOULD
YOU LIKE TO DO?

22:41.628 --> 22:43.863
I THINK I'LL GO
FUCK HER AGAIN.

22:43.963 --> 22:47.033
YEAH, I'LL FUCK HER

22:47.133 --> 22:48.768
WELL AND PROPER
THIS TIME.

22:48.868 --> 22:50.903
I'LL FUCK HER
SLOW AND GOOD.

22:51.003 --> 22:52.605
I'LL TAKE MY TIME

22:52.705 --> 22:55.542
UP INTO THAT SWEET,
HOT LITTLE PUSSY.

22:55.642 --> 22:57.910
I MEAN,
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

22:58.010 --> 23:00.647
I MEAN, SHE THINKS SHE'S
THE BELLE OF THE BALL.
FUCK THAT.

23:00.747 --> 23:03.683
SHE MUST BE PRETTY
MISERABLE IF SHE'S COMING
TO SEE YOU, RIGHT?

23:03.783 --> 23:07.153
DON'T ASSUME THAT EVERYBODY
WHO COMES TO SEE ME
IS MISERABLE, ALEX.

23:07.253 --> 23:10.423
LOOK, DOC, WHEN I
CAME TO PICK HER UP
FROM HERE YESTERDAY

23:10.523 --> 23:12.091
SHE WAS LIKE
A COMPLETE PSYCHOPATH.

23:12.191 --> 23:15.127
ONE MINUTE
SHE'S HUGGING ME,
COMPLETELY OVER THE TOP

23:15.227 --> 23:16.729
LIKE WE'RE IN
SOME KIND OF MOVIE.

23:16.829 --> 23:18.765
THE NEXT MINUTE,
AS SOON AS I CLOSE
THE CAR DOOR,

23:18.865 --> 23:20.399
SHE'S LIKE, "TAKE ME HOME.
I'M TOO TIRED TO DO
ANYTHING TODAY."

23:20.500 --> 23:22.334
I MEAN,
WHAT THE FUCK?

23:22.435 --> 23:25.171
SHE TURNED
AS COLD AS ICE.

23:25.271 --> 23:26.939
SHE WAS TWO TOTALLY
DIFFERENT PEOPLE.

23:27.039 --> 23:28.741
I MEAN, GO FIGURE
WHAT GOES THROUGH
HER HEAD.

23:28.841 --> 23:32.211
LISTEN TO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.
YOU'RE BELITTLING HER AGAIN.

23:32.311 --> 23:34.447
HEY, YOU DON'T THINK
SHE BELITTLES ME?

23:34.547 --> 23:36.148
YOU DON'T THINK I KNOW

23:36.248 --> 23:38.818
THAT SHE'S COMPLETELY
AND TOTALLY HUNG UP
ON SOMEONE ELSE?

23:42.088 --> 23:44.223
CHECK THIS OUT.

23:44.323 --> 23:46.125
SATURDAY,
AFTER WE HAD SEX,

23:46.225 --> 23:47.894
SHE STRADDLES MY LEG.

23:47.994 --> 23:51.931
SHE STARTS RUBBING
UP AGAINST ME AS IF
I'M NOT EVEN THERE.

23:52.031 --> 23:54.366
IT SO OBVIOUS
SHE'S FANTASIZING ABOUT
SOMEBODY ELSE.

23:54.467 --> 23:58.337
AND THEN SHE
STARTS CRYING.

23:58.437 --> 24:01.207
I MEAN, TEARS
AND EVERYTHING.

24:01.307 --> 24:02.609
SHE'S JUST CRYING,
AND I ASK HER,

24:02.709 --> 24:04.977
"LAURA, WHAT'S UP?

24:05.077 --> 24:07.279
EVERYTHING OKAY?"

24:07.379 --> 24:10.116
SHE DOESN'T
EVEN LOOK AT ME.

24:10.216 --> 24:13.319
SHE DOESN'T EVEN
ANSWER ME,

24:13.419 --> 24:16.422
LIKE I'M JUST
HER DILDO.

24:16.523 --> 24:19.191
DON'T TELL ME
I BELITTLE HER, OKAY?

24:34.974 --> 24:38.678
I KNOW THIS IS GOING
TO SOUND CRAZY AFTER
EVERYTHING I JUST SAID...

24:42.214 --> 24:45.084
BUT DO YOU THINK
WE HAVE A CHANCE TOGETHER,
ME AND LAURA?

24:45.184 --> 24:47.153
IF WE REALLY WORK AT IT?

24:47.253 --> 24:49.221
I DON'T KNOW, ALEX.

24:49.321 --> 24:51.591
I COULDN'T EVEN--

24:52.759 --> 24:55.127
I DON'T KNOW THAT.

24:55.227 --> 24:57.296
I THINK IT COULD HAPPEN.

24:57.396 --> 24:58.798
I MEAN,
LIKE YOU SAID, DOC,

24:58.898 --> 25:02.034
IT'S A LONG SERIES
OF SMALL STEPS, RIGHT?

25:02.134 --> 25:04.236
MM-HMM, YES IT IS.

25:08.307 --> 25:12.879
WELL, OUR TIME
IS UP FOR TODAY.

25:12.979 --> 25:15.682
ALREADY?

25:17.984 --> 25:20.687
WHY DON'T WE
CONTINUE NEXT WEEK

25:20.787 --> 25:24.523
WHERE WE LEFT OFF
TODAY, OKAY?

25:43.542 --> 25:45.077
THANKS.

25:45.177 --> 25:47.614
YOU'RE WELCOME.

26:13.940 --> 26:16.108
