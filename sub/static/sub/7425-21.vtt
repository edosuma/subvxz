No!

Cat.

Help.

00:16.781 --> 00:18.261
Heather must've
said something to Gabe

00:18.283 --> 00:19.816
and Gabe told Sheckman.
No, but he would never

00:19.850 --> 00:21.051
put Heather in danger
like that.

00:21.085 --> 00:22.619
That-that's
not protecting me.

00:22.653 --> 00:23.887
A task force has been formed

00:23.921 --> 00:24.921
to capture the fugitive

00:24.955 --> 00:26.890
Vincent Keller.

00:26.924 --> 00:29.459
Trying like hell
to get you exonerated,

defeat the purpose?

00:49.947 --> 00:51.013
Well, what defeats the purpose,
is this stupid,

itchy mustache, which...

00:52.282 --> 00:53.316
makes me look like
a serial killer.

No, I think you look cute.

01:04.861 --> 01:06.127
I'll push the stroller.
- It's not the stroller, okay?

01:06.162 --> 01:07.329
It's everything.
It's the stupid disguises.

01:07.363 --> 01:08.630
It's the living
in the youth hostel.

01:08.665 --> 01:10.131
I like the hostel.
it's sort of like...

01:10.166 --> 01:12.300
we're on vacation,
backpacking in Europe;

01:12.335 --> 01:13.701
it's kind of romantic.

Romantic, really?
The walls are paper thin.

01:15.404 --> 01:17.005

one more time...

01:18.674 --> 01:19.841
Okay, it's better them
having sex

01:19.875 --> 01:21.343
than watching
the local news.

01:21.377 --> 01:23.144
You're right, it is
the perfect hiding spot.

01:23.179 --> 01:24.612
Yeah, which we

Not for long.

01:30.719 --> 01:32.319
I know that
you're nervous...

01:32.354 --> 01:34.455
but, I know that Knox
is gonna push this through.

01:34.490 --> 01:35.890
I bet you 50 bucks

01:35.924 --> 01:37.057
that's why he wants
to meet with us today.

01:37.092 --> 01:38.526
You don't even have
50 bucks to bet,

01:38.560 --> 01:40.127
because Gabe
had you suspended

01:40.161 --> 01:41.401
and ruined your career.
- But...

01:41.429 --> 01:42.897
I will be
reinstated,

01:42.931 --> 01:45.132
as soon as
you're exonerated.

01:45.166 --> 01:46.300

01:55.343 --> 01:56.910
Look, Agent Knox...

01:56.944 --> 01:58.045
you know,

01:58.079 --> 02:00.647
what... happened
in suburbia...

02:00.681 --> 02:01.715
It is my fault.

02:01.749 --> 02:04.083
Well, and we did
solve a murder.

02:04.118 --> 02:06.185
Which proves that we can
be an asset to the FBI.

02:06.220 --> 02:07.387
Did you two rehearse that?

02:07.421 --> 02:09.589
No.
- Sort of.

02:09.624 --> 02:12.425
Well, I explained all that
to the attorney general.

02:12.459 --> 02:14.427
Let me guess,
Gabe blocked it again?

02:14.461 --> 02:16.362
No. In fact,

02:16.397 --> 02:18.164
I convinced the department
to drop the murder charges.

02:18.198 --> 02:19.832
Hey, you owe me
50 bucks.

02:19.866 --> 02:21.667

02:28.909 --> 02:30.543
But exonerating
a fugitive on the run?

02:30.577 --> 02:31.744
They'll get too much heat.

02:31.778 --> 02:33.046

04:11.642 --> 04:12.808

- Who? What?

04:12.843 --> 04:13.943
I have a source...

04:13.977 --> 04:15.511
says she's protecting him

04:15.545 --> 04:18.047
because Keller was part of some
military experiment

04:18.081 --> 04:19.380
that super-charged
his DNA.

04:19.415 --> 04:20.882

you could corroborate.

someone is writing a story

05:13.268 --> 05:15.203
Okay, sorry.
But it just seems like

05:15.237 --> 05:16.337
Gabe told Beth
about everything.

05:16.371 --> 05:17.371
Unbelievable.

05:17.406 --> 05:18.706
Actually, it's not.

05:18.740 --> 05:20.340
He's lost all
political power, so,

05:20.374 --> 05:22.042
he's chosen
the nuclear one: Exposure.

05:22.077 --> 05:23.343

So, once again,

If this Beth girl
writes this story,

05:26.447 --> 05:27.715
the attorney general

05:27.749 --> 05:29.249
is gonna have a hard time
letting me out.

05:29.283 --> 05:31.885
So, I'm stuck in a cell,
while this news is out there.

05:31.920 --> 05:33.087
No, we have
another option.

05:33.121 --> 05:34.188
What, kill Gabe?

05:34.222 --> 05:35.756
No. Talk to him,
convince him

05:35.790 --> 05:37.457
to call Beth off.
- Okay, that might work on a

05:37.491 --> 05:39.092
rational human being,
but he's come unhinged.

05:39.126 --> 05:41.361
Unhinged is
an understatement,

05:41.395 --> 05:43.129
try murderer...
kidnapper.

05:43.163 --> 05:44.531
No, but in his mind,

05:44.565 --> 05:46.099
he's been doing all this
to protect me from you, right?

05:46.133 --> 05:47.367
So, I can go over there,

05:47.401 --> 05:49.135
tell him he
doesn't have to anymore,

05:49.169 --> 05:50.604
that he can call Beth off
because you're going to prison.

05:50.638 --> 05:52.305
No. I don't want you
alone with him.

05:52.340 --> 05:54.306
But you can't come,
you're too angry.

05:54.341 --> 05:55.374
And you're not?

05:55.408 --> 05:56.408
No, I am...

05:56.409 --> 05:57.576
Cause right now,
it kind of seems like

05:57.611 --> 05:58.878
you're defending him.

05:58.912 --> 06:00.613
No. I am trying
to figure this out.

06:00.647 --> 06:02.407
Instead of getting angry,
which doesn't help.

06:02.415 --> 06:03.716
If you lose it on him Vincent,

06:03.751 --> 06:04.884
if you do anything
to Gabe,

06:04.918 --> 06:06.119
there goes
your exoneration.

06:06.153 --> 06:08.087
And I have to go alone.

06:08.122 --> 06:09.821
The reason why
he's become unhinged

06:09.856 --> 06:11.323
is because
I rejected him for you.

06:11.358 --> 06:13.559
And he's become
a little obsessed.

06:13.593 --> 06:15.827
Right. And I thought
you were trying to defuse me.

06:15.862 --> 06:17.730
I'm just saying,

06:17.764 --> 06:19.431
I have a certain power over him

06:19.466 --> 06:21.027
and I intend to use that
to our benefit.

06:27.140 --> 06:29.641
Well, you know, clearly, the...

06:29.675 --> 06:31.342
the whole blonde thing

06:31.377 --> 06:32.710
is really getting to her.

06:39.518 --> 06:40.639
Thank you for letting me up.

06:40.653 --> 06:41.753
Of course.

06:41.788 --> 06:43.421
Welcome back. From?

06:43.455 --> 06:45.423
Being on the run.

06:45.457 --> 06:47.325
Look... Cat,

06:47.359 --> 06:50.027
if you are here
to punch me or to...

06:50.061 --> 06:51.262
No. I come in peace.

06:51.297 --> 06:52.337
Because
everything I did...

06:52.364 --> 06:54.198
Was to protect me, I know.

06:54.232 --> 06:56.000
Turns out, that
you getting me suspended

06:56.034 --> 06:57.602
was a good thing.

06:57.636 --> 07:00.137
It gave me time to realize
that you were right,

07:00.172 --> 07:01.505
that Vincent
isn't above the law.

07:01.539 --> 07:03.040
I convinced him

07:03.074 --> 07:04.708
that he needs to
face the consequences

07:04.742 --> 07:07.812
and turn himself in
and he was ready to do that

07:07.846 --> 07:10.781
until he found out
that you had talked to Beth.

07:10.816 --> 07:12.449
Ah... Beth.

07:12.483 --> 07:13.684
So, that's what
this visit's about.

07:13.718 --> 07:16.720
Yeah. I can't
convince him to do this

07:16.754 --> 07:18.355
if-if he thinks that

07:18.389 --> 07:20.724
he's gonna be
turned into a lab rat.

07:20.758 --> 07:22.192
So, you want me
to call Beth?

07:22.226 --> 07:25.295
Yeah, and tell her
that you made a mistake,

07:25.330 --> 07:26.463
that you had

07:26.497 --> 07:27.731
false information.

07:27.765 --> 07:29.032
And then, you will get
what you want...

07:29.066 --> 07:30.634
Vincent behind bars.

07:30.668 --> 07:32.548
Yeah, but that's not
the only thing that I want.

07:33.737 --> 07:36.706
I want a shot
with you.

07:36.740 --> 07:39.175
A genuine shot.
- Gabe.

07:39.210 --> 07:40.977
Look, I know,
given everything I've done,

07:41.011 --> 07:42.879
asking you to be with me
right now

07:42.913 --> 07:44.013
would be preposterous.

07:44.048 --> 07:45.381
But, if I could explain...

07:45.415 --> 07:47.150
You already have,
you were protecting me.

07:47.184 --> 07:49.719
No, I mean, really explain,
spend some time together,

07:49.753 --> 07:51.354
earn your forgiveness.

07:51.388 --> 07:53.255
Then, you'd be able to
open your heart to me.

07:53.289 --> 07:54.990
Maybe.

07:55.024 --> 07:56.191
What are you asking me?

07:56.226 --> 07:58.661
Go out with me.
- On a date?

07:58.695 --> 08:00.596
But you have to promise
to go into it

08:00.630 --> 08:02.898
with your heart open
to the possibility

08:02.932 --> 08:05.400
of us finding our way
back to each other.

08:05.434 --> 08:07.169
I mean, if Vincent's
gonna turn himself in,

08:07.203 --> 08:08.737
then you two will be apart
anyway, right?

08:08.771 --> 08:11.907
So, I agree to this...

08:11.941 --> 08:13.742
and you just call Beth off?

08:13.776 --> 08:16.178
Say "yes" and I will
call her right now.

08:21.217 --> 08:22.684
Okay.

08:24.253 --> 08:26.187
I mean, yes.

08:34.264 --> 08:38.264

08:43.265 --> 08:45.658
Tess know her way
around Lizzie D's closet

08:45.659 --> 08:47.508
like it was her own closet.

08:49.611 --> 08:50.645
Is that...?

08:50.679 --> 08:52.246
The Swedes.

08:52.280 --> 08:54.314
Four or five times
per day.

08:54.349 --> 08:55.949
Tess should date them.

08:55.983 --> 08:57.784
I mean, what if we're
sexually mismatched?

08:57.818 --> 09:00.487
What if I'm not
adventurous enough for her?

09:01.622 --> 09:02.923
Okay...

09:02.957 --> 09:05.225
Gabe called Beth off,
story's dead.

09:05.260 --> 09:06.393
You can turn yourself in
tomorrow.

09:06.428 --> 09:07.827
That's amazing. See?

09:07.862 --> 09:08.895
I'm the one
with the problem, not you.

09:08.930 --> 09:10.830
That is amazing.

09:10.865 --> 09:12.265
What's bothering you?

09:12.299 --> 09:15.001
I knew you were gonna
ask me that and...

09:15.036 --> 09:16.402
it's only bothering me

09:16.437 --> 09:18.004
because I know it'll bother you.

09:18.039 --> 09:20.506
Okay, what did he do?

09:20.541 --> 09:21.775
He had one condition,

09:21.809 --> 09:23.242
which I agreed to

09:23.277 --> 09:24.310
because if I didn't...

09:24.344 --> 09:25.445
All right, okay,
come on, please,

09:25.479 --> 09:26.746
what is the condition?

09:26.781 --> 09:29.982
Okay... he wants me to
give him a shot

09:30.016 --> 09:31.451
at earning my forgiveness back,

09:31.485 --> 09:33.852
which I'm obviously not
really going to do,

09:33.887 --> 09:35.421
but I need to go out
on a date with him

09:35.456 --> 09:37.490
and pretend that I'm open
to the possibility.

09:37.524 --> 09:39.992
Pretend? But you actually
have to go on a date with him?

09:40.026 --> 09:41.627
I told you, you know,
he's obsessed with me,

09:41.661 --> 09:43.762
we need to
take advantage of that.

09:43.797 --> 09:44.797
Okay, maybe you do
have a problem.

09:44.831 --> 09:46.364
Okay, so, how many bases

09:46.399 --> 09:48.300
does, uh,
pretend forgiveness

09:48.334 --> 09:49.635
entail?
- What? None.

09:49.669 --> 09:50.803
You know, why don't you
just let JT and Tess

09:50.837 --> 09:52.270
go back to Lizzie D's,

09:52.305 --> 09:53.639
get out a couple
of costumes

09:53.673 --> 09:54.873
and you guys can do
some role-playing.

09:54.908 --> 09:55.941
Wait, you two role-play?

09:55.976 --> 09:57.342
I can stall things.

09:57.376 --> 09:58.978
I move slowly,
Gabe knows that firsthand.

09:59.012 --> 10:00.845
I don't want to know about
Gabe's firsthand.

10:00.879 --> 10:04.015
I am just saying,
that I can be light and easy

10:04.049 --> 10:05.450
and he won't question that.

10:05.485 --> 10:07.005
But you have to be
light and easy, too.

10:07.019 --> 10:08.686
That means...
when I'm out with him,

10:08.721 --> 10:10.455
you can't check in.
No calling, no texting.

10:10.490 --> 10:12.991
I can't text
from prison anyway. Wait...

10:13.025 --> 10:14.859
when is this
pretend date?

10:14.893 --> 10:17.294
Tonight.

10:18.731 --> 10:20.364
So, I'm supposed to
just sit here

10:20.398 --> 10:22.800
all alone, on my
final night of freedom...

10:22.835 --> 10:23.968
And practice for tomorrow.

10:24.003 --> 10:25.970
Knox e-mailed me,

10:26.005 --> 10:27.171
he's setting up
a press conference

10:27.205 --> 10:29.007
after your
surprise surrender.

10:29.041 --> 10:31.976
You have to seem like
an innocent war hero;

10:32.011 --> 10:34.478
no anger, no edges.

10:34.513 --> 10:36.213
Like JT.

10:36.248 --> 10:40.251
Hey! Excuse me, if I don't
have any animal DNA in me.

10:40.285 --> 10:41.852
Well, you can have
some of mine, okay?

10:41.886 --> 10:42.919
'Cause it makes
"light and easy"

10:42.954 --> 10:44.321
<i>completely</i> impossible.

10:44.356 --> 10:45.589
Okay, you think
my DNA likes this?

10:45.624 --> 10:47.158
I am troubleshooting here,

10:47.192 --> 10:48.759
which means checking
my emotions at the door

10:48.793 --> 10:49.993
and you have to
do that, too.

10:50.028 --> 10:53.196
Light and easy, okay?

10:55.000 --> 11:01.074

11:04.709 --> 11:06.942
The signature cocktails

11:06.977 --> 11:08.878
could be Pink Margaritas
and the Naughty Schoolgirl--

11:08.912 --> 11:10.413
that's martinis
with a Blow Pop.

11:10.447 --> 11:13.249
Is that bachelorette party
planning I hear?

11:13.284 --> 11:14.517
Cat? You're back.
Oh, my God.

11:14.552 --> 11:16.118
This is the
best surprise ever.

11:16.153 --> 11:17.387
Uh, meanwhile,
what's going on with that?

11:17.421 --> 11:19.189
Yeah. You look fabulous.

11:19.223 --> 11:20.890
You know it's not until
tomorrow night, right?

11:20.924 --> 11:22.625
Yeah. I just,
I've got a thing.

11:22.660 --> 11:24.060
One hot date with Vincent,
before he goes to jail?

11:24.094 --> 11:25.127
Tess filled me in.

11:25.162 --> 11:27.529
Actually, I am

11:27.564 --> 11:29.065
going out with Gabe.

11:29.099 --> 11:30.766
Gabe?
- What?

11:30.801 --> 11:34.070
Heather, I know you don't even
want to hear his name right now,

11:34.104 --> 11:35.571
but it's the only way
I could get him to

11:35.605 --> 11:36.706
keep Vincent's secret.

11:36.740 --> 11:38.240
Plus, it is just a meal.

11:38.274 --> 11:39.941
Okay, that dress does not say
"just a meal."

11:39.975 --> 11:42.077
This dress says "open heart,"
which, I don't have,

11:42.111 --> 11:43.212
which is why I'm faking it
with clothing.

11:43.246 --> 11:44.813
Well, I can't fake it.

11:44.847 --> 11:47.482
How am I supposed to enjoy
picking out a stripper knowing

11:47.517 --> 11:49.618
- that you're out with this...
- You might enjoy it more if you

11:49.652 --> 11:51.453
come forward about...
This party's happening in 24 hours.

11:51.487 --> 11:52.487
I don't have time
to go to the precinct...

11:52.522 --> 11:54.256
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

11:54.290 --> 11:56.424
We just need to focus on
our goals right now,

11:56.458 --> 11:58.426
which are throwing you
an amazing party

11:58.460 --> 11:59.660
and thwarting Gabe.

11:59.695 --> 12:01.329
And you can help
with both those things,

12:01.363 --> 12:03.464
cause you are not only,
a bride-to-be,

12:03.498 --> 12:05.566
but you're also an
amazing publicist.

12:05.601 --> 12:07.268
So, you can help Vincent
prep for his press conference,

12:07.302 --> 12:08.569
which is going to
get him exonerated

12:08.604 --> 12:10.739
and there is nothing
that Gabe wants less.

12:10.773 --> 12:11.906
Okay.

12:11.941 --> 12:13.173
Okay.

12:15.777 --> 12:17.311
He's here.

12:20.382 --> 12:23.751
Hi. I'm Vincent Keller,

12:23.785 --> 12:25.786
although a lot of you
probably already know that.

12:25.820 --> 12:26.920
Not so serious.

12:26.955 --> 12:28.222
Smile.

12:30.024 --> 12:33.861
From all the "wanted" banners
on your computer screens;

12:33.895 --> 12:36.997
better than
ad banners, I-I guess.

12:37.031 --> 12:40.200
I-I did a little punch up.

12:40.235 --> 12:41.635
The talking points
the FBI sent were so dry.

12:41.669 --> 12:44.171
I've got Cat's phone,

12:44.205 --> 12:45.272
she's headed up 6th.

12:45.306 --> 12:46.306
Toward what?

12:46.340 --> 12:47.641
I don't know,
it's a long avenue.

12:48.876 --> 12:50.209
Uh-uh, Vincent, we're...

12:50.244 --> 12:51.678
Well, up 6th
is Harlem

12:51.712 --> 12:53.346
and then after Harlem
is Queens.

12:53.381 --> 12:55.515
And you know what's
in Queens? Both airports.

12:55.549 --> 12:56.983
She's not getting on
a plane with Gabe.

12:57.017 --> 12:58.618
But she-she doesn't
have a choice,

12:58.653 --> 13:00.320
if he forces her.
And she doesn't have her

13:00.354 --> 13:01.688
gun on her.
- Hey.

13:01.722 --> 13:04.290
You said tracking her phone
would keep you calm.

13:04.324 --> 13:05.524
Okay, can we get back
to the speech?

13:05.558 --> 13:07.026
Because, helping you

13:07.060 --> 13:08.627
is the only thing
keeping me from panicking.

13:08.662 --> 13:10.129
Heather, please,
I can't focus on

13:10.164 --> 13:11.664
talking points right now.
Please. Thank you.

13:11.698 --> 13:13.299
So, what? Your gonna
bust in on their date?

13:13.333 --> 13:15.301
No. I'm gonna trail her.

13:15.335 --> 13:17.569
Okay. Just to make sure
she's fine.

13:17.604 --> 13:19.004
From a distance.

13:19.038 --> 13:21.206
They're on a date.

13:21.240 --> 13:22.308
No way... you'll be able to
keep a distance,

13:22.342 --> 13:24.009
let alone, your cool.

13:24.043 --> 13:26.745
You could lose it in the
middle of some local restaurant,

13:26.780 --> 13:29.014
which... I'm sure,
is where they're headed.

13:29.048 --> 13:30.182
Okay, well, right now,

13:30.216 --> 13:32.117
I don't really care
about exposure.

13:34.187 --> 13:35.187
Whoa, hey, is that a gun?!

13:35.221 --> 13:37.155
No. It's just a tranq.

13:37.190 --> 13:39.057
Light and easy, remember?

13:39.091 --> 13:40.358
Now, sit down

13:40.392 --> 13:42.894
and read the damn speech.

13:42.929 --> 13:45.030
Heather... he's all yours.

13:46.966 --> 13:49.400
And you thought
I had no animal DNA.

13:49.435 --> 13:51.236
Okay, I have no idea
what that means.

13:51.270 --> 13:52.670
But they are not
going to the airport.

13:52.705 --> 13:54.071
They stopped on
72nd Street.

13:54.105 --> 13:56.374
What's on 72nd?

13:57.643 --> 14:01.346
Cake decorating.

14:01.380 --> 14:03.781
This is not where I thought
the limo was headed.

14:03.816 --> 14:06.584
You thought we were going to
some stuffy restaurant, right?

14:06.618 --> 14:07.852
But you forget...

14:07.886 --> 14:10.354
I know you.
It was between this

14:10.388 --> 14:11.621
and bumper cars.

14:11.656 --> 14:13.090
Well, at least with this,

14:13.124 --> 14:14.424
I get to make something
for my sister.

14:14.459 --> 14:17.627
Not that I don't love
bumper cars. Oh!

14:17.662 --> 14:19.730
They've got a high heeled shoe
in a cookie cutter,

14:19.764 --> 14:20.764
so, I'm gonna do that

14:20.798 --> 14:21.798
with the
black and white

14:21.833 --> 14:23.567
to match her
color scheme.

14:23.601 --> 14:24.701
So, uh...
when's the party?

14:24.736 --> 14:26.636
Tomorrow.

14:26.671 --> 14:28.572
A lot's happening tomorrow.

14:28.606 --> 14:29.939
Vincent's
turning himself in...

14:29.974 --> 14:31.140
What are you gonna
decorate yours with?

14:31.175 --> 14:32.542
I don't know.

14:32.577 --> 14:34.478
I'm having
cake decorating block.

14:34.512 --> 14:37.381
Well, how do you feel
about trucks?

14:37.415 --> 14:39.015
Great, when I was seven.

14:40.317 --> 14:42.385
The truth is,
I think I'm blocked

14:42.419 --> 14:44.053
because I can't stop
thinking about your sister.

14:44.088 --> 14:45.388
Probably, because I'm
making her this awesome cake.

14:45.422 --> 14:47.957
You know,
you could use pumps, too.

14:47.992 --> 14:50.459
I'm thinking about
what happened to her.

14:50.494 --> 14:52.228
Catherine,
I never intended...

14:52.263 --> 14:54.230
What about flowers?
Too feminine?

14:54.265 --> 14:56.332
Here.
- I get why you're deflecting.

14:56.367 --> 14:57.900
If I say,
"I did it to protect you,"

14:57.934 --> 14:59.468
one more time,
you're gonna scream, right?

14:59.503 --> 15:01.437
Yeah. That and...

15:01.471 --> 15:03.806
it's kind of hard to forgive.

15:05.542 --> 15:07.976
But I am trying to have
an open heart.

15:08.011 --> 15:09.845
That is why
I want to try to explain.

15:09.880 --> 15:11.614
You know what happened
to my mother, right?

15:11.648 --> 15:13.148
When you were a kid, yeah.

15:13.182 --> 15:14.349
When I was like Vincent.

15:14.384 --> 15:16.618
It was an accident, Gabe.

15:16.652 --> 15:17.953
No, it wasn't.

15:17.987 --> 15:20.688
Look, I pushed her

15:20.723 --> 15:22.024
down those stairs,

15:22.058 --> 15:23.458
I couldn't stop myself.

15:23.492 --> 15:24.826
Even though,
I loved her more than anything.

15:24.860 --> 15:27.462
I don't doubt
that Vincent loves you,

15:27.496 --> 15:29.331
but that doesn't mean
he won't hurt you.

15:29.365 --> 15:31.599
<i>That</i> is why I did
all those questionable things.

15:31.634 --> 15:33.301
And I am so sorry

15:33.335 --> 15:34.702
if I hurt you.

15:34.737 --> 15:37.539
But you didn't want to
have that happen again.

15:37.573 --> 15:40.742
Not to someone I love.

15:43.846 --> 15:47.214
That's a lot
for a cake decorating date.

15:47.249 --> 15:48.715
No. It's okay.

15:48.750 --> 15:51.018
I'm glad that you told me.

15:51.053 --> 15:53.321
You know,

15:53.355 --> 15:55.122
I know what
I'm going to put on my cake.

15:57.759 --> 15:59.693
Hearts.

16:03.698 --> 16:05.966
It's good.

16:18.346 --> 16:20.013
Well, that was fun.
 Um...

16:20.047 --> 16:21.647
and now, I have a headache

16:21.682 --> 16:24.084
from all that wine and sugar.

16:24.118 --> 16:25.818
I'm not gonna ask
to come up.

16:25.853 --> 16:27.587
I'm just not there.

16:27.621 --> 16:28.721
I understand.

16:28.755 --> 16:29.856
It's gonna take a bit.

16:29.890 --> 16:30.890
Maybe after bumper cars.

16:37.397 --> 16:39.665
Good night, Cat.
- Good night.

16:50.243 --> 16:51.878
What are you doing here?

16:51.912 --> 16:53.912
Just, uh...
Just waiting up for you.

16:53.946 --> 16:55.780
Uh, these guys
are just guarding me.

16:55.815 --> 16:57.516
Kind of feel like
I'm in prison already.

16:57.550 --> 16:59.618
Light and easy
is not easy for this one.

16:59.652 --> 17:00.886
Yeah.
JT almost tranqed him.

17:00.920 --> 17:02.554
But then
he did all of his PR homework

17:02.588 --> 17:04.089
and he offered to help decorate.

17:04.124 --> 17:05.957
And now you guys
are leaving, right?

17:05.992 --> 17:07.358
Because it is my last night

17:07.394 --> 17:08.926
with my girlfriend

17:08.961 --> 17:10.194
before I hit the slammer.

17:10.229 --> 17:11.396
Hey...

17:11.430 --> 17:12.430
we're not going anywhere,
until we get

17:12.464 --> 17:14.665
all the gory details.

17:19.972 --> 17:22.240
Okay, so...

17:33.852 --> 17:35.253
Driver...

17:35.287 --> 17:37.288
I think we're gonna
have to turn around.

17:37.322 --> 17:38.956
<i>And then he apologized</i>
<i>for having you kidnapped,</i>

17:38.990 --> 17:40.258
as if I'm going to be like,

17:40.292 --> 17:41.592
"Yeah... sure. Not a problem."

17:41.626 --> 17:43.994
I can't believe
you let him kiss you.

17:44.029 --> 17:45.629
It was just a peck.

17:45.664 --> 17:46.797
And it would've been
more obvious

17:46.831 --> 17:48.465
if I hadn't let him.

17:48.499 --> 17:50.500
It took every ounce
of willpower

17:50.535 --> 17:53.003
not to throw him
off me.

17:53.038 --> 17:54.271
But I didn't

17:54.305 --> 17:56.674
because this fake date
is going to work.

17:56.708 --> 17:59.276
And all you have to do tomorrow
is be light and easy.

17:59.310 --> 18:00.843
In a month from now,
you will be exonerated

18:00.878 --> 18:03.113
and we will never
see Gabe again.

18:07.092 --> 18:09.645
Uh, however,
just because I <i>am</i> innocent

18:09.646 --> 18:12.495
does not excuse the fact
that I ran from the law.

18:12.595 --> 18:14.295
I, uh, I know, that...

18:14.330 --> 18:15.664
I scared the public.

18:15.698 --> 18:17.399
He's doing great.

18:17.433 --> 18:19.067
Yeah.

18:20.603 --> 18:22.137
Hey, you did a good job.

18:22.171 --> 18:23.938
Oh. He's the one up there.

18:23.972 --> 18:25.306
But, I'm calling

18:25.341 --> 18:26.841
because JT and I
are having a little issue.

18:26.875 --> 18:28.743
And so it is,
with a contrite heart

18:28.777 --> 18:31.012
that I... surrender.

18:31.047 --> 18:34.416
He saw a picture of the stripper
Tess chose and freaked out.

18:34.450 --> 18:36.084
I didn't freak out!

18:36.118 --> 18:38.253
I was just, a little...
taken back.

18:38.287 --> 18:40.487
Anyway, he dropped your cake.

18:40.522 --> 18:42.089
I know I wasn't supposed to
look at it, but...

18:42.123 --> 18:43.123
Heather, it's okay.

18:43.124 --> 18:44.191
It's so cute, by the way.

18:44.225 --> 18:45.546
I love the
blue and white tie-dye.

18:46.962 --> 18:47.962
Uh, Specialist Keller?

18:47.996 --> 18:49.797
Can you comment
on rumors

18:49.831 --> 18:51.098
that your DNA
has been altered?

18:51.132 --> 18:53.034
Uh, e-e-e-excuse me?

18:53.068 --> 18:54.435
That's Beth!

18:54.469 --> 18:56.836
Weren't you a part of a
failed military experiment

18:56.871 --> 18:58.138
to create super soldiers?

18:58.173 --> 18:59.339
I-I'm, I'm sorry.

18:59.374 --> 19:00.541
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

19:00.575 --> 19:02.842
I thought Gabe called her off.
- So did I.

19:04.312 --> 19:05.512
Well, isn't that why
the FBI's involved?

19:05.547 --> 19:07.814
They're, they're trying to
protect and cover up.

19:07.848 --> 19:10.384
We're involved,
because this is a federal case,

19:10.418 --> 19:11.851
not a plot
in a comic book.

19:11.886 --> 19:13.526
Thank you very much.
No further questions.

19:16.390 --> 19:17.724
Okay, wait...

19:17.758 --> 19:19.859
did you say that the
cake was blue and white?

19:19.894 --> 19:21.795
Uh... yeah.
With little hearts.

19:31.338 --> 19:32.905
I took the wrong cake.

19:32.939 --> 19:34.807
Gabe must've come by to swap
them and overheard us.

19:34.841 --> 19:36.175
You know,
I was joking before

19:36.210 --> 19:37.843
but I swear,
I am gonna kill him.

19:37.877 --> 19:39.145
Yeah, that wouldn't
help your cause.

19:39.179 --> 19:40.913
Hey, it's not
about my cause.

19:40.947 --> 19:43.749
All right. He thinks
that you were playing him,

19:43.783 --> 19:47.086
God knows what he is
gonna do to you, Catherine.

19:47.120 --> 19:48.754
Reporters these days,
huh?

19:48.788 --> 19:50.322
Yeah, talk about
desperate for a story.

19:51.457 --> 19:52.992
It's true.

19:53.026 --> 19:54.107
Everything
the reporter said

19:54.127 --> 19:55.861
is completely true.

19:55.895 --> 19:57.029
Vincent.
- What?

19:58.297 --> 20:00.332
I am a potentially
out of control super soldier

20:00.366 --> 20:01.733
and I can not be incarcerated.

20:01.767 --> 20:03.535
Right now, that
that story is out there,

20:03.569 --> 20:04.902
there is a target on my back.
Is he for real?

20:04.937 --> 20:05.937
Yes.

20:05.938 --> 20:07.339
He has modified DNA,

20:07.373 --> 20:08.673
but that's not why
he's doing this.

20:08.707 --> 20:10.008
He is trying to
protect me from Gabe.

20:10.042 --> 20:12.010
I'm sorry,
modified DNA?

20:12.044 --> 20:13.578
And you're only telling me now?

20:13.613 --> 20:14.773
We were trying to
protect you.

20:14.780 --> 20:15.747
People that know
about this, end up dying.

20:15.781 --> 20:16.781
Okay, that's
beside the point.

20:16.815 --> 20:18.449
But we have to
do something else,

20:18.483 --> 20:19.617
other than going to prison.

20:19.652 --> 20:21.252
Something else?!

20:21.286 --> 20:22.286
Those guys
with cuffs over there

20:22.320 --> 20:23.587
are waiting to take you away.

20:23.622 --> 20:25.556
You just surrendered
in front of America

20:25.590 --> 20:27.759
with me by your side.
I'm out on a limb, here.

20:27.793 --> 20:29.093
We know, we're so grateful.
I can't believe this.

20:29.128 --> 20:31.395
I've heard about something
like this, but...

20:31.429 --> 20:32.730
This is why we keep telling you
he could be an asset.

20:32.765 --> 20:34.931
It's how we were able to
rescue your colleague.

20:34.966 --> 20:36.300
He could do
so much more.

20:36.334 --> 20:37.635
And you're not out on a limb.

20:37.669 --> 20:38.902
We can control this.

20:38.936 --> 20:40.638
No one else
needs to know about it.

20:40.672 --> 20:41.905
The reporter?
How are you gonna control that?

20:41.939 --> 20:43.374
She's a high school
friend of mine,

20:43.408 --> 20:44.975
I can talk to her. And, Vincent,

20:45.009 --> 20:47.611
maybe Agent Knox can
get you into a solitary cell.

20:47.646 --> 20:49.446
Can you even be in a cell?

20:49.481 --> 20:51.048
Yes. He can act like
every other prisoner.

20:51.082 --> 20:52.983
They say "jump,"
he will jump.

20:53.017 --> 20:55.952
Okay.

20:55.987 --> 20:58.221
But you can not
break out again

20:58.255 --> 21:00.290
or it's on me.
- On one condition.

21:00.324 --> 21:02.559
Yes, I have a condition
this time.

21:02.593 --> 21:04.494
You stay away from Gabe.

21:04.528 --> 21:06.096
Done.

21:12.836 --> 21:14.637
You obviously didn't prod
hard enough.

21:14.672 --> 21:15.738
I prodded plenty.

21:15.772 --> 21:17.740
You said he'd have a reaction.

21:17.774 --> 21:19.942
The only reaction I got
was from my colleagues

21:19.976 --> 21:21.777
wondering if I'm working for
the <i>National Inquirer.</i>

21:21.812 --> 21:24.180
Look, Beth,
I know there's been a lot of

21:24.214 --> 21:25.614
back and forth on this, but...

21:25.648 --> 21:26.916
Can you hang on a minute?

21:26.950 --> 21:28.517
Can I help you?

21:28.551 --> 21:30.753
Yeah. Rewiring your neighbors,
I just want to...

21:30.787 --> 21:33.923
I have proof--
a serum, that corrupts DNA.

21:33.957 --> 21:35.624
A serum?

21:35.658 --> 21:36.692
Back when I was running

21:36.727 --> 21:38.293
the precinct, we arrested

21:38.328 --> 21:40.962
a-a deranged scientist,
Sam Landon.

21:40.996 --> 21:42.631
He developed it
based on research

21:42.665 --> 21:44.699
the government used...

21:44.734 --> 21:46.835
Hey, Cat's calling me
on the other line.

21:46.869 --> 21:49.037
Probably to do damage control.

21:49.071 --> 21:50.839
Look, Beth, this is real.

21:50.873 --> 21:53.141
This is the secret,
that she's been protecting.

21:53.175 --> 21:54.809
Protecting, why?

21:54.844 --> 21:57.779
Because she's in love
with Vincent.

22:05.820 --> 22:07.722
Evening,
Specialist Keller.

22:07.756 --> 22:09.724
I'm Agent Thomas,
this is Agent Barnett.

22:09.758 --> 22:11.191
Knox wants to do some tests.

22:11.226 --> 22:12.627
Tests for what?

22:12.661 --> 22:13.694
Mm, wants to see
what you can do.

22:13.729 --> 22:15.496
Part of getting you
out of here

22:15.530 --> 22:17.364
as soon as possible.

22:20.769 --> 22:21.769
There a problem?

22:21.770 --> 22:22.870
No.

22:22.904 --> 22:25.205
You say "jump"...

22:26.707 --> 22:27.841
...I jump.

22:30.245 --> 22:33.180
♪ I've been such a good girl,
living in a bad world... ♪

22:33.214 --> 22:34.347
That's why I invited you here.

22:34.382 --> 22:37.150
I thought it was
to celebrate Heather.

22:37.184 --> 22:39.218
I just think that before you writ
 this story, you need all the facts.

22:39.253 --> 22:40.853
You're with Vincent,
and that's why you're

22:40.888 --> 22:42.489
protecting him.
I have all the facts.

22:42.523 --> 22:44.758
Okay, but doesn't that put Gabe,
as a source, into question?

22:44.792 --> 22:46.893
He is the spurned ex.

22:46.927 --> 22:48.027
Uh, wait, what?

22:48.061 --> 22:50.163
Yeah. We dated.

22:51.398 --> 22:52.731
So much for
having all the facts.

22:54.935 --> 22:56.375
Cat, it's your turn
to pin the macho!

22:56.403 --> 22:57.870
Okay, one second.

22:57.905 --> 22:59.105
That's what Gabe's doing.

22:59.139 --> 23:00.873
He's trying to pin this
on Vincent

23:00.908 --> 23:02.775
'cause he knows he's gonna get
cleared of murder charges.

23:02.810 --> 23:04.743
It's like in high school,

23:04.778 --> 23:06.745
when Tommy Rice said
that Lisa Lieberman had VD

23:06.780 --> 23:08.079
after she dumped him,

23:08.114 --> 23:10.582
so that no one else
would date her.

23:10.617 --> 23:12.884
Gabe is making up crazy things
to get Vincent out of the picture.

23:12.919 --> 23:14.586
It doesn't mean
that what he's saying isn't true

23:14.621 --> 23:16.722
and Lisa Lieberman
<i>did</i> have something.

23:16.756 --> 23:19.725
Look, you both know
that I saw that guy here...

23:19.759 --> 23:21.927
in this apartment.
You were traumatized.

23:21.961 --> 23:24.629
Both of you keep saying that,
but I wasn't.

23:24.663 --> 23:27.065
And you forget, I knew you
when your mother was killed.

23:27.099 --> 23:29.734
And you told everyone
a beast saved you.

23:29.768 --> 23:31.903
Gabe's using that, too.

23:31.938 --> 23:33.571
You don't get the extent
of his crazy, all right?

23:33.605 --> 23:34.639
He kidnapped Heather.

23:34.673 --> 23:36.141
Tess.
- Kidnapped?

23:36.175 --> 23:38.243
There's been
no charges filed.

23:38.277 --> 23:39.444
Heather has been busy
planning the party.

23:41.613 --> 23:43.013
I have to take this.

23:44.516 --> 23:46.250
What do you mean,
he's not in his cell?

23:46.284 --> 23:48.219
I mean, he escaped again.

23:48.253 --> 23:50.154
No. That's impossible.

23:50.188 --> 23:52.590
Beth still thinks that Gabe
is a reliable source.

23:52.624 --> 23:54.592
Can you just please,
tell her what he did to you?

23:54.626 --> 23:56.227
I told you.

23:56.261 --> 23:57.928
I don't know what
you're talking about.

23:57.963 --> 23:59.296
I just called to check on him

23:59.331 --> 24:01.232
and the guard says
he's not there.

24:01.266 --> 24:02.304
Heather...

24:02.328 --> 24:03.968
You were supposed to make this
the most amazing night

24:03.969 --> 24:06.237
of my life, and now,
you've completely ruined it!

24:10.175 --> 24:12.276
Well, I... uh...

24:12.310 --> 24:14.307
I just totally screwed up
with your sister.

24:14.331 --> 24:15.486
Vincent's gone.
What?!

24:15.487 --> 24:17.013
Yeah. Someone must have
seen that press conference

24:17.047 --> 24:18.682
and had him taken.

24:18.716 --> 24:20.283
We've been so focused
on killing Beth's story,

24:20.317 --> 24:22.018
we forgot that people are
still after the beast.

24:22.052 --> 24:24.254
Well, where you going?
I'm going to Gabe's.

24:24.288 --> 24:26.356
I think this might have
been his plan all along.

24:26.391 --> 24:28.725
Uh...

24:31.695 --> 24:33.596
Hey. Fireman Franz.

24:33.630 --> 24:35.932
You the lady on fire?
- Yes.

24:37.234 --> 24:39.135
Should I chase her?

24:39.169 --> 24:42.138
No, it's a...
it's a different kind of fire.

24:43.429 --> 24:45.487
Heather open up, please.

24:45.512 --> 24:48.090
Fireman Franz is here,
and he looks even cuter

24:48.091 --> 24:49.726
than he did on the Web site.

24:49.760 --> 24:52.928
I don't really feel
like being hosed down right now.

24:52.963 --> 24:55.564
Look, I am so sorry
that I blabbed to Beth, okay?

24:55.598 --> 24:57.233
I had too many Schoolgirls.

24:57.267 --> 24:58.968
So, it's true?

24:59.002 --> 25:01.570
Excuse me. I'm in the middle
of a private conversation.

25:01.604 --> 25:04.806
And, no, it is not true.
I lied to make a point.

25:04.841 --> 25:07.109
But don't let me ruin
your party, all right?

25:07.143 --> 25:09.111
Look, your friends won't even
let him take his clothes off

25:09.145 --> 25:10.912
until the bride-to-be
comes out here.

25:10.946 --> 25:13.281
Just tell him
to strip without me, okay?

25:13.315 --> 25:15.984
I can't pretend to be the happy
bride-to-be one more minute.

25:16.018 --> 25:17.652
Pretend? Why?
Because she knows about Vincent,

25:17.687 --> 25:19.087
and you guys won't let her
say anything?

25:19.121 --> 25:20.589
Can you go?

25:20.623 --> 25:21.990
Seriously, she's not
even friends with you.

25:22.024 --> 25:23.859
Well, neither are you, Tess!

25:23.893 --> 25:25.293
You have the biggest mouth
in the world!

25:25.327 --> 25:26.795
I haven't even told my fiancé.

25:26.829 --> 25:28.196
You haven't?

25:28.230 --> 25:30.031
About what?
About Vincent?

25:30.065 --> 25:31.832
About the fact
that I was kidnapped,

25:31.867 --> 25:33.601
and I'm completely traumatized.

25:33.635 --> 25:35.436
And I am not opening this door.

25:37.706 --> 25:40.875
♪ I'm on a train
going nowhere ♪

25:40.910 --> 25:45.613
♪ I ran away
to make you care... ♪

25:45.647 --> 25:48.616
You know, this thing
can go as fast as a car.

25:48.650 --> 25:50.117
A car?

25:50.151 --> 25:51.619
Well, I'm not sure what Knox

25:51.653 --> 25:53.186
told you about me.

25:53.221 --> 25:54.488
That you have
some incredible talents.

25:54.523 --> 25:57.324
I don't know about that.

25:57.358 --> 25:59.493
Thing is,
your vitals seem great,

25:59.528 --> 26:01.061
like you're not
even trying.

26:01.095 --> 26:02.996
Oh, you got all that
from this little wristband, huh?

26:03.031 --> 26:05.498
I just want to make sure
that you're not holding back.

26:05.533 --> 26:09.002
Look, this is the pace I'm
gonna go until Knox gets here,

26:09.037 --> 26:10.837
okay? If you want
to change the music,

26:10.871 --> 26:13.106
kill some time, then go ahead.

26:16.444 --> 26:18.478
Is that Knox now?

26:19.447 --> 26:21.848
What?

26:21.882 --> 26:24.884
<i>Gabe? Open up. It's Cat.</i>

26:26.921 --> 26:28.688
Hey, you can't go in there.

26:28.722 --> 26:29.923
What are you doing?

26:29.957 --> 26:31.658
Get out of here!
- What is this?

26:31.692 --> 26:33.159
That's ADA Lowan.

26:35.728 --> 26:36.829
You looking for your cake?

26:36.863 --> 26:38.364
Okay, I'm sorry

26:38.398 --> 26:39.932
if you overheard anything
that hurt your feelings,

26:39.967 --> 26:42.335
but where is he?

26:42.369 --> 26:44.503
Come on, Gabe. Where's Vincent?
'Cause he's not in his cell, and

26:44.537 --> 26:45.871
Knox doesn't know where he is.

26:45.905 --> 26:47.273
Who do you really work for, huh?

26:47.307 --> 26:49.075
Who do you work for?!

26:49.109 --> 26:51.309
I'm not leaving
until you tell me.

26:52.378 --> 26:53.779
No!

26:53.813 --> 26:57.516
Don't shoot him!

27:12.999 --> 27:15.100
Okay. Okay, that was awesome.

27:18.471 --> 27:19.904
Let me see your
phone, e-mail.

27:19.938 --> 27:21.806
You must have
contacted somebody.

27:21.840 --> 27:23.541
I told you, I don't
know where he is.

27:23.575 --> 27:25.242
Right, so you just
talked to Beth

27:25.276 --> 27:26.878
to get her
to write some article?

27:26.912 --> 27:28.479
I don't think so.

27:28.514 --> 27:30.815
You wanted her to start asking
questions publicly to alert

27:30.849 --> 27:32.750
whoever's after Vincent.
That was your whole plan.

27:32.784 --> 27:35.052
My whole plan

27:35.086 --> 27:37.755
was to have a genuine
shot at us being together,

27:37.789 --> 27:39.923
but you, apparently,
were just using me.

27:39.957 --> 27:41.392
You were threatening exposure.

27:41.426 --> 27:43.186
Don't try to justify it.
We had an agreement.

27:43.194 --> 27:44.828
And I held up my end.

27:44.862 --> 27:46.963
I put on a dress,
and I got in your limo.

27:46.998 --> 27:50.234
All I asked was that you go
into this an open heart.

27:50.268 --> 27:51.735
After everything you've done?

27:51.769 --> 27:54.071
Gabe, you kidnapped
my little sister.

27:54.105 --> 27:56.740
You've blocked Vincent
and my happiness at every turn.

27:56.774 --> 27:58.694
Your lack of happiness
has nothing to do with me.

27:58.709 --> 28:00.076
He is who he is.

28:00.110 --> 28:01.711
Take a look at this.

28:03.280 --> 28:05.348
It's Rebecca Reynolds' journal.

28:05.382 --> 28:07.651
I found it when I was doing
all that research for you.

28:07.685 --> 28:09.419
Rebecca had a beast
in her life, too.

28:09.453 --> 28:12.022
He turned out
to be so dangerous

28:12.056 --> 28:13.523
that she had to kill him.

28:13.557 --> 28:15.791
I am trying to save you
from that fate.

28:15.825 --> 28:18.694
My fate isn't written
by some relative 200 years ago.

28:18.728 --> 28:21.097
Well, it seems
like a pretty big coincidence.

28:21.131 --> 28:25.168
Catherine, you are never going
to be happy with him.

28:25.202 --> 28:27.170
You don't know
what makes me happy.

28:27.204 --> 28:29.204
I do, and I think
you know that, too.

28:29.238 --> 28:30.505
I mean, come on, Cat.

28:30.540 --> 28:31.774
We both know
that you're not here

28:31.808 --> 28:33.508
looking for where Vincent is.

28:33.543 --> 28:34.609
What?

28:34.643 --> 28:37.679
Look, think about it.

28:37.713 --> 28:39.547
You believe that I used Beth

28:39.582 --> 28:43.051
to alert the boogeymen who are
after Vincent, right? So,

28:43.085 --> 28:44.485
doesn't that mean
that I don't know

28:44.519 --> 28:45.853
how to get a hold
of them myself?

28:45.888 --> 28:47.254
So, how could I know
where he is?

28:49.157 --> 28:52.626
Cat, you are here because

28:52.660 --> 28:54.695
I am the man
that you run to

28:54.729 --> 28:57.164
when you need help.
I am your safe haven.

28:57.199 --> 28:58.741
Okay, you are... you are crazy.
- No.

28:58.742 --> 29:00.383
You know it's true.
We belong together.

29:00.407 --> 29:01.711
No, we don't!

29:04.439 --> 29:06.807
Did you just push me?

29:06.841 --> 29:09.375
Okay, look, Gabe, I...

29:09.410 --> 29:11.011
I just want to know
where Vincent is, okay?

29:11.045 --> 29:13.413
Well, hopefully,

29:13.447 --> 29:15.816
he's being dissected
into little bits.

29:15.850 --> 29:17.884
It's what he deserves.

29:17.919 --> 29:19.753
Rebecca Reynolds
would have agreed.

29:19.787 --> 29:23.090
And as for me supposedly doing
all of these awful things?

29:23.124 --> 29:25.658
You shouldn't just
be forgiving me. You should be

29:25.692 --> 29:27.193
thanking me.
I was protecting you from him!

29:27.228 --> 29:29.329
I don't need your protection!

29:29.363 --> 29:31.531
Yes, you do!

29:41.642 --> 29:43.976
Gabe?

29:45.612 --> 29:48.114
Gabe?

29:48.148 --> 29:49.749
Oh, my God.

29:57.978 --> 29:59.492
Where's your pal?

30:00.108 --> 30:01.876
They're on with
the Department,

30:01.911 --> 30:03.812
figuring out what
to do with you.

30:03.846 --> 30:05.814
What department's that?

30:05.848 --> 30:07.714
We're legit. We work for
the government, okay?

30:07.749 --> 30:09.050
We are the good guys.

30:09.084 --> 30:10.784
Right, so,
by "good guys", you mean

30:10.819 --> 30:13.054
guys that are good
at covering things up.

30:13.088 --> 30:14.989
All right, tell me this.

30:15.023 --> 30:16.623
Why are you surveilling
ADA Lowan, huh?

30:16.658 --> 30:18.792
Is it because
he's been talking to reporters?

30:18.827 --> 30:20.161
You weren't supposed
to go in there.

30:20.195 --> 30:21.963
It's just that,
in my experience,

30:21.997 --> 30:25.165
anyone who talks about this
program publicly winds up dead.

30:25.199 --> 30:27.233
Is that what's going
to happen to Gabe?

30:27.268 --> 30:28.669
I just make the gadgets.

30:28.703 --> 30:30.303
Why don't

30:30.338 --> 30:34.074
you let me take care
of him for you, hmm?

30:34.108 --> 30:37.177
You... you want us
just to let you go?

30:37.211 --> 30:38.946
Well, it's not like
you won't know where I am.

30:38.980 --> 30:40.613
I'll go back to prison.

30:40.647 --> 30:42.182
I'll have a perfect alibi,

30:42.216 --> 30:44.717
and everything will remain
classified.

30:49.556 --> 30:52.359
He has a
proposition for us.

30:52.393 --> 30:53.659
Let's hear it.

30:59.132 --> 31:01.333
Three, four, five, six, seven,

31:01.368 --> 31:04.637
eight, nine, ten, 11, 12,
13, 14, 15, 16...

31:04.671 --> 31:07.039
What's going on?

31:07.073 --> 31:09.141
Okay, it's not
what it looks like.

31:09.175 --> 31:11.010
I-I don't even know
what it looks like,

31:11.044 --> 31:13.612
but you-you have to do
something, you have to save him.

31:13.646 --> 31:15.314
He doesn't have a pulse.
Save him? Really?

31:15.348 --> 31:16.815
Well, actually,
I came here to kill him.

31:16.849 --> 31:18.717
No. I... I did this.

31:18.751 --> 31:21.220
I was at the bachelorette party,
and Agent Knox called me, and

31:21.254 --> 31:23.688
he didn't know where you were,
and I thought that Gabe was

31:23.723 --> 31:25.324
responsible, and things just escalated.
All right, easy, easy.

31:25.358 --> 31:27.393
Easy, easy. Light and easy, remember?
But I told you,

31:27.427 --> 31:29.728
he doesn't have a pulse.
Okay, I know that I promised

31:29.762 --> 31:31.563
I'd stay away from him, but
I wasn't thinking clearly,

31:31.597 --> 31:33.665
and I thought he'd know
where you were, so I just...

31:33.699 --> 31:35.634
- It's JT. I needed a doctor.

31:35.668 --> 31:37.836
- Come in.
- He still dead?

31:37.870 --> 31:38.870
Vincent's trying
to save him.

31:38.905 --> 31:40.405
You escaped again?

31:40.439 --> 31:42.340
So much for positive press?

31:42.374 --> 31:44.910
The only thing I can think of
is cardiac tamponade.

31:44.944 --> 31:48.413
That sounds bad. It's a buildup of fluid
around the, uh... the heart.

31:48.447 --> 31:49.680
It must be blood
from the trauma.

31:49.714 --> 31:52.083
You did this? Really?
Can you fix it?

31:52.117 --> 31:53.817
Okay, I need something
to relieve the pressure

31:53.852 --> 31:55.852
and-and drain the fluid.
There's a needle in there.

31:55.854 --> 31:58.389
I pulled out Gabe's flatlining kit.
Okay,

31:58.424 --> 32:00.191
I need to restrain him
in case he wakes up.

32:00.225 --> 32:02.092
Uh, I've got handcuffs.

32:02.126 --> 32:03.527
They're for me and Tess,

32:03.562 --> 32:04.562
'cause I do have edge.

32:05.864 --> 32:08.198
Oh, not... not that much edge.

32:08.232 --> 32:09.800
All right, I got it.

32:11.770 --> 32:14.004
Okay, check his pulse.
Okay.

32:14.039 --> 32:16.239
Yeah. I feel it.

32:16.274 --> 32:17.775
Is he gonna be okay?
This means I didn't kill him?

32:17.809 --> 32:19.742
No, you didn't kill him.

32:22.046 --> 32:24.714
And I didn't
kill him, either.

32:26.551 --> 32:30.253
Hey, it's okay.

32:30.288 --> 32:33.890
Now we're hugging
because he's alive.

32:36.560 --> 32:37.894
All right, guys, if she
feels any better, we'll

32:37.928 --> 32:39.168
meet you over there, okay?
Okay.

32:42.232 --> 32:44.433
Beth, I got it.
You can go home, too.

32:44.468 --> 32:46.435
I'm not here as a reporter
anymore, okay?

32:46.470 --> 32:48.370
I... I actually
really care about Heather.

32:48.405 --> 32:50.306
In fact,

32:50.340 --> 32:52.208
I've known her
a little longer than you.

32:52.242 --> 32:54.143
Okay, it's not a competition.
And don't even pretend

32:54.177 --> 32:55.978
like you're not
gonna leap at her

32:56.012 --> 32:58.747
with questions the second she
comes out of that bathroom.

32:58.781 --> 33:02.050
- You're the one who made her cry.
- This is neither of your faults.

33:02.085 --> 33:02.922
Heather.

33:02.946 --> 33:04.907
No, I shouldn't even
have had this party.

33:05.155 --> 33:06.622
You know why
I had it now?

33:06.656 --> 33:08.289
Because my fiancé's
out of town

33:08.324 --> 33:09.958
and I'm too terrified
of being alone.

33:09.993 --> 33:12.460
I just wanted to feel like
a bride-to-be, you know,

33:12.495 --> 33:14.796
I wanted to be all blissed
out on wedding dresses

33:14.831 --> 33:18.566
and silly phallic party favors,
instead of constantly thinking

33:18.601 --> 33:21.670
about being in that dungeon,

33:21.704 --> 33:23.905
scared I'm about to die.

33:23.940 --> 33:26.007
You know,

33:26.041 --> 33:28.343
after that night,
when I thought I saw

33:28.377 --> 33:30.478
whatever it was
that I saw,

33:30.513 --> 33:32.347
I've never
written so many

33:32.381 --> 33:35.517
puff pieces
in my entire career.

33:35.551 --> 33:37.685
You were right, Tess.

33:37.719 --> 33:39.287
I was traumatized.

33:39.321 --> 33:41.488
Gabe took
full advantage of that.

33:41.523 --> 33:42.957
Gabe.

33:42.991 --> 33:44.959
We should pin the macho on him.

33:44.993 --> 33:48.129
Well, there is something
you could do to get back at him.

33:48.163 --> 33:50.097
Yeah, not write my story.

33:51.900 --> 33:53.433
Actually, I was
talking to Heather.

33:59.740 --> 34:01.441
So, you didn't
break out of prison--

34:01.476 --> 34:02.976
you did everything
you were supposed to?

34:03.010 --> 34:04.611
Except kill Gabe.

34:04.646 --> 34:06.713
Well, I wasn't supposed to.

34:06.747 --> 34:09.149
Last few days I've
been telling everyone

34:09.184 --> 34:11.284
I can take care of
things, just telling them

34:11.319 --> 34:13.119
to manage the situation,
light and easy,

34:13.154 --> 34:14.453
and then I go and...

34:14.487 --> 34:16.289
Beast out?

34:16.322 --> 34:19.225
I was going to say
lose complete control,

34:19.259 --> 34:22.395
but, yeah. Yeah,
I beasted out.

34:22.429 --> 34:24.330
Got so angry I
scared myself.

34:24.364 --> 34:26.331
Oh, I know the feeling.

34:26.366 --> 34:28.501
But you're supposed to do that.

34:28.534 --> 34:30.170
What, because of my DNA?

34:30.204 --> 34:32.071
What, so I can lose
it, but you can't?

34:32.105 --> 34:34.473
You know what I mean,
it's different.

34:36.243 --> 34:39.411
Look, I'm not saying what
happened tonight was okay.

34:39.446 --> 34:41.813
But maybe the reason
it happened is because

34:41.848 --> 34:44.083
you do have some anger.

34:44.117 --> 34:46.085
Which you're completely
entitled to,

34:46.119 --> 34:48.485
given everything that
Gabe has done, all right?

34:48.521 --> 34:50.889
All right, it's just...
I don't know, it's like

34:50.924 --> 34:53.257
you never really let
yourself express it.

34:53.292 --> 34:55.594
You're always calming
everyone else down.

34:55.628 --> 34:58.030
I guess I'm saying

34:58.064 --> 34:59.698
you don't always
have to fix

34:59.733 --> 35:01.666
everyone else's mess.

35:01.701 --> 35:03.535
You know, in fact,
it was kind of nice

35:03.569 --> 35:06.170
for me to fix your mess for once.
- Oh, come on,

35:06.205 --> 35:07.339
you fix my messes.

35:07.373 --> 35:09.673
I save you, sometimes,

35:09.708 --> 35:11.108
from other people, but...

35:11.142 --> 35:13.076
not from yourself.

35:16.080 --> 35:18.849
And if you hadn't have
beasted out on Gabe tonight,

35:18.883 --> 35:20.251
I would've come over here,

35:20.285 --> 35:21.918
killed him,
he would be dead, and I

35:21.953 --> 35:23.454
would be
in a lot of trouble.

35:23.488 --> 35:25.188
So, your beasting out,

35:25.223 --> 35:27.724
in the end, saved him.

35:27.759 --> 35:30.927
And me.

35:30.962 --> 35:32.796
Knox is calling
for you. And FYI,

35:32.830 --> 35:35.232
you-know-who is stirring.

35:35.266 --> 35:37.768
Yeah, hey.

35:37.802 --> 35:39.435
Congratulations.

35:39.470 --> 35:41.271
You've been exonerated
of all charges.

35:45.342 --> 35:46.576
He pushed it through.

35:46.610 --> 35:48.411
What?
- Oh, my God.

35:48.445 --> 35:49.812
Actually, it wasn't
me who did it.

35:49.846 --> 35:51.481
Well, who was it?

35:51.515 --> 35:53.449
I'm thinking whoever signed you
out of prison today.

35:53.484 --> 35:56.152
So they were legit.
Who are these guys?

35:56.186 --> 35:58.954
Don't know. But they
must go pretty high up.

35:58.989 --> 36:01.323
Yeah, sure.

36:01.357 --> 36:04.026
Okay, thank you.
Thanks.

36:05.662 --> 36:07.830
I got to take him
to the agents who broke me out.

36:07.864 --> 36:09.431
Whoever they are.

36:09.465 --> 36:11.333
Wait, you're leaving?
What about Voldemort?

36:11.367 --> 36:12.467
I can handle him.

36:13.870 --> 36:17.472
I mean, I will
have JT supervise.

36:18.708 --> 36:20.375
You're a free man.

36:33.355 --> 36:35.690
Sorry about the cuffs.

36:35.724 --> 36:37.458
It's over now.

36:37.492 --> 36:39.060
Vincent's been
exonerated.

36:41.396 --> 36:42.831
And if you try to expose him--

36:42.865 --> 36:44.966
you talk to Beth,
you talk to anybody--

36:45.000 --> 36:47.168
I will come
after you.

36:47.203 --> 36:50.137
I will expose everything
that you have done.

36:50.171 --> 36:51.939
And Heather will, too.

36:51.973 --> 36:55.108
Tess called.
She wants to come forward.

36:56.211 --> 36:58.278
You lost, Gabe.

36:58.313 --> 37:01.181
And it makes me really sad.

37:01.216 --> 37:04.184
Because there was a time when
I really had feelings for you,

37:04.219 --> 37:08.688
when you were a man who
wanted to save people.

37:08.723 --> 37:12.025
And that is why I agreed
to go on that fake date.

37:12.060 --> 37:15.062
I went into it with an open
heart-- not a romantic one--

37:15.096 --> 37:17.364
but one that was hoping
to find that man again.

37:21.435 --> 37:23.370
But he's gone.

37:38.722 --> 37:41.062
I swear it was filled
with equipment.

37:41.444 --> 37:43.946
Obviously, they didn't
want us to find them.

37:45.449 --> 37:48.044
They say what they wanted with
you other than to kill Gabe?

37:48.232 --> 37:50.533
No, that was just
the deal I made with them

37:50.567 --> 37:53.736
to let me go from here.

37:53.771 --> 37:55.705
Why would
they do that?

38:07.484 --> 38:10.052
Because they got
what they wanted.

38:10.086 --> 38:12.721
My blood.

38:12.755 --> 38:16.258
I can't believe
you went back to Lizzie D's.

38:16.293 --> 38:20.296
I told you, I'm edgy.

38:20.330 --> 38:22.764
JT, I don't need you
to be edgy, okay?

38:22.799 --> 38:24.800
I was into edgy
when I was 22.

38:24.834 --> 38:26.585
But what you said,
in the... in the store.

38:26.609 --> 38:27.402
Oh.

38:27.403 --> 38:29.938
I was overcompensating.

38:29.972 --> 38:31.906
To be honest, like,
this stuff makes me

38:31.941 --> 38:33.475
nervous, too, and...

38:33.509 --> 38:35.744
I didn't fully realize
it till Franz, that

38:35.778 --> 38:38.880
stripper guy, he showed up,
and I could barely look at him.

38:38.914 --> 38:41.649
You weren't into Franz, either?
No, I was hiding in

38:41.683 --> 38:43.751
Cat's hall the entire
show. I was almost

38:43.785 --> 38:45.119
relieved when Heather
had the breakdown,

38:45.154 --> 38:46.620
so, you know,
I had an excuse.

38:46.655 --> 38:48.823
So we're not
sexually mismatched?

38:48.858 --> 38:51.792
Not that I'm aware of.

38:51.827 --> 38:53.594
Do you think we are?

38:53.628 --> 38:55.897
No.

38:58.266 --> 39:00.368
I'm good.

39:01.970 --> 39:03.671
We probably shouldn't
do this at Gabe's.

39:03.705 --> 39:06.674
Oh.
- Yeah.

39:06.708 --> 39:07.941
He still in the bathroom?

39:07.976 --> 39:09.377
Gabe?

39:17.218 --> 39:19.119
Gabe?

39:19.153 --> 39:21.355
Gabe?

39:21.389 --> 39:24.157
Gabe, you okay?

39:45.846 --> 39:48.381
You know, it sounds like
those Swedes have left.

39:48.415 --> 39:50.182
Maybe we should
stay another night.

39:50.217 --> 39:52.518
Huh?

39:55.822 --> 39:57.790
Okay, what are you reading?

39:57.824 --> 39:59.625
Rebecca Reynolds' journal.

39:59.659 --> 40:01.160
Gabe had it.

40:01.194 --> 40:03.462
It's all about how she feels

40:03.496 --> 40:05.997
like she has to kill Alistair.
Who?

40:06.032 --> 40:07.223
Her beast.

40:07.247 --> 40:10.668
Her beast? Alistair, Really?
That is a ridiculous name.

40:10.669 --> 40:12.870
Okay, well, it was
a long time ago,

40:12.904 --> 40:15.072
back then Alistair was like "Jake."
- That's my

40:15.106 --> 40:17.375
second point: it was
a long time ago, so

40:17.409 --> 40:19.143
it doesn't mean anything.
We got nothing to worry about.

40:19.177 --> 40:21.211
Yeah, except for the mysterious men
who stole your blood.

40:21.246 --> 40:23.713
Catherine, come on,
you were right, okay?

40:23.748 --> 40:26.150
You're getting your badge
back, I'm a free man.

40:26.184 --> 40:27.651
No one thinks I
ripped anyone's

40:27.685 --> 40:28.986
heart out. I can
walk down the street

40:29.020 --> 40:30.587
without a fake mustache.

40:30.621 --> 40:33.891
Although, right
now, I mean...

40:33.925 --> 40:35.358
it is raining.

40:36.694 --> 40:38.595
I would rather stay
inside, anyway.

40:38.629 --> 40:40.397
Oh, now you appreciate
the youth hostel.

40:40.431 --> 40:43.366
You know, I've always wanted to...

40:43.401 --> 40:45.368
backpack around Europe.

40:45.403 --> 40:46.536
Yeah?

40:46.570 --> 40:48.338
Can you put that wig back on?

40:48.372 --> 40:50.307
Just one more time.

40:52.777 --> 40:54.277
Is that a no?
Mm-hmm.

40:54.311 --> 40:55.344
Mm-hmm?
- Mm-hmm.

40:55.378 --> 40:56.412
Is that no?
- Mm-hmm.

40:56.446 --> 40:57.446
Okay.

41:03.954 --> 41:06.588
Sorry to make you wait.

41:06.623 --> 41:09.192
Yeah, in the middle
of the night.

41:09.226 --> 41:11.860
So, you brought
the serum?

41:11.894 --> 41:14.062
Actually, I didn't.
- Right.

41:14.096 --> 41:16.365
Because none of this
is real, right, Gabe?

41:16.399 --> 41:19.802
Look, I'm not
doing this story.

41:19.836 --> 41:22.438
I don't believe Vincent's a
beast, or that they even exist.

41:22.472 --> 41:24.873
Well, they do. And tomorrow,
everyone will know.

41:24.907 --> 41:27.209
What does that mean?
