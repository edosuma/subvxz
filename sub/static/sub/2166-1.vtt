02:44.373 --> 02:46.842
Fall back!

02:47.000 --> 02:48.252
Go! Go! Go!

03:01.765 --> 03:03.767
Thanks. I'd hate to miss the view.

03:19.366 --> 03:22.711
You know, the cops didn't seem
to like you that much, Ms. Lane.

03:23.245 --> 03:26.249
- Occupational hazard.
- You and me both.

03:27.749 --> 03:29.342
So which are you guys angling for?

03:29.501 --> 03:32.220
Life in prison or, you know,
blaze of glory?

03:32.379 --> 03:36.259
You watch your mouth, lady.
You're not proving to be much use to us.

03:36.425 --> 03:40.726
No offense, it just takes pretty huge stones
to get this noisy in Metropolis.

03:40.887 --> 03:44.107
Oh, didn't you hear?
Seven-point-two in Belize this morning.

03:44.266 --> 03:47.065
Superman's busy, we scramble.

03:47.227 --> 03:51.152
- You do know he flies fast, right?
- We'll take our chances.

04:41.698 --> 04:44.042
- What the...?
- Plus there's the other one.

04:44.201 --> 04:45.453
Other one?

04:45.619 --> 04:48.873
- Superman's cousin. Didn't you hear?
- No, I didn't hear.

04:49.039 --> 04:51.542
You really should read my column.

04:59.382 --> 05:01.384
You don't know many teenage girls,
do you?

05:02.886 --> 05:06.390
Rebellious, angry at the world,
doesn't know her own strength?

05:09.810 --> 05:10.982
You're in deep trouble.

05:17.859 --> 05:18.906
Ow!

05:49.057 --> 05:51.401
Hold it, the skirt's the bad cop?

05:53.687 --> 05:55.030
She's just visiting.

05:56.606 --> 05:58.199
Metropolis is my turf.

06:06.116 --> 06:09.211
- You all right, Ms. Lane?
- I am now, Superman.

06:09.369 --> 06:10.996
- Nice outfit.
- Thanks.

06:11.162 --> 06:14.462
If I knew I was gonna be abducted,
I might have skipped the heels.

06:15.625 --> 06:16.717
Seat belt?

06:19.880 --> 06:21.052
Enough!

06:21.214 --> 06:23.888
Let me explain how this is gonna go.

06:33.059 --> 06:35.061
Anyone else care to educate me?

06:48.158 --> 06:50.957
Kara, what the hell were you
trying to prove out there?

06:51.119 --> 06:53.838
I was stopping bad guys.
That's what we do, right?

06:53.997 --> 06:57.001
- Stop them, not scramble them.
- Don't lecture me, Kal.

06:57.167 --> 06:58.589
I'm still older than you.

06:58.752 --> 07:01.756
No. You may have left Krypton that way,
but you're not anymore.

07:01.922 --> 07:03.845
The wormhole got me here faster.

07:04.007 --> 07:05.179
That's not fair.

07:05.675 --> 07:06.847
Tell it to Einstein.

07:07.010 --> 07:09.729
- Who?
- Smart guy. Lived here on Earth.

07:09.888 --> 07:11.105
Do your homework.

07:11.264 --> 07:12.481
Why don't you do yours?

07:13.099 --> 07:14.191
Excuse me?

07:14.351 --> 07:16.353
You've spent your whole life
on this planet.

07:16.519 --> 07:18.021
You grew up with these powers.

07:18.188 --> 07:21.863
Do you even remember Krypton?
Your parents? My parents?

07:22.692 --> 07:23.864
Only a little.

07:24.027 --> 07:27.031
Well, for me, it was only several months ago.

07:28.865 --> 07:30.913
I didn't have powers. Nobody did.

07:31.076 --> 07:33.625
And when bad things happened,
we were helpless.

07:37.290 --> 07:40.715
Kara, I can't know unless you tell me.

07:46.841 --> 07:50.721
Ask regular people down there how they feel
when guys like that terrorize them.

07:52.555 --> 07:53.977
I have powers now.

07:56.893 --> 07:59.316
And I'm going to use them.

08:11.074 --> 08:12.667
This is U. S. Space Surveillance.

08:12.826 --> 08:16.330
<i>We've got an unknown object,
incoming over the southwestern U.S.</i>

08:16.496 --> 08:19.625
<i>Lost contact
with communications satellite VN59.</i>

08:19.791 --> 08:22.544
<i>GEODSS, can you get a visual?</i>

08:24.671 --> 08:27.049
- Teenagers.
- It's a matter of calibration.

08:27.215 --> 08:28.888
She's a good kid. She'll learn.

08:29.426 --> 08:31.929
- So, what's your excuse?
- Meaning?

08:32.095 --> 08:34.268
You volunteered to be their hostage?

08:34.431 --> 08:36.058
Well, better me than someone else.

08:36.224 --> 08:38.568
You have to stop doing things like that.

08:39.019 --> 08:42.614
- No, what I have to do is get the story.
- Other reporters do their jobs...

08:42.772 --> 08:44.866
...without needing me
to save them every time.

08:45.025 --> 08:48.074
Other reporters don't have the <i>access</i> I do.

08:48.236 --> 08:50.830
To the stories or to me?

08:50.989 --> 08:53.287
Both.

08:53.700 --> 08:55.122
Must be awful being you.

08:55.285 --> 08:56.787
Most powerful man in the world...

08:56.953 --> 08:59.957
...and you still can't control
the women in your life.

09:02.917 --> 09:03.964
Kent.

09:04.627 --> 09:05.753
You're not Kent.

09:06.171 --> 09:07.297
Uh, just leaving a note.

09:11.760 --> 09:15.481
Think he'll mind if I use his DVD player?
Mine's...

09:15.638 --> 09:18.061
I busted mine.

09:18.558 --> 09:20.560
You and he aren't dating?

09:20.727 --> 09:23.697
- What makes you ask?
- Yeah, didn't think so.

09:23.855 --> 09:25.823
I got a little theory about Kent.

09:25.982 --> 09:28.610
The way he's so secretive
about his personal life?

09:29.944 --> 09:32.072
- Yeah?
- Ask him if he's got a girlfriend...

09:32.238 --> 09:34.240
...you never get a straight answer.

09:34.407 --> 09:38.162
How he's not really a sports guy,
but he's in that great shape.

09:39.162 --> 09:41.585
- Huh.
- I'm just saying.

09:41.748 --> 09:44.797
- So, what's your story?
- Me?

09:47.087 --> 09:48.760
We know you're not with Kent.

09:48.922 --> 09:52.927
Oh, it's just, I thought you were asking
about Clark because you were...

09:53.093 --> 09:55.437
Me? Hey listen, baby.

09:55.595 --> 10:00.852
Any time you need proof what makes me
stand and salute, you just let me... Aah! Unh!

10:01.267 --> 10:04.020
Ooh. Sorry,
I've been meaning to get that fixed.

10:04.187 --> 10:05.814
Lois, Perry wants to see us.

10:06.856 --> 10:09.359
Heart rate, breathing, skin temp.

10:09.526 --> 10:11.949
- What? You're mad at me?
- You're something else.

10:12.112 --> 10:13.864
I don't care what he thinks about me.

10:14.030 --> 10:16.704
I know that.
I'm surprised you didn't think of it yourself.

10:16.866 --> 10:18.038
It's the perfect cover.

10:18.201 --> 10:20.295
- Then what?
- You don't want anyone knowing...

10:20.453 --> 10:24.549
...that we're together, but at the same time,
you don't let another guy even talk to me.

10:24.707 --> 10:27.335
It's like I'm going out with my own stalker.

10:28.002 --> 10:30.881
Him? Lombard?
You want that guy hitting on you?

10:31.047 --> 10:35.052
No. That's not the point.
The point is, you need to ease up a little.

10:35.510 --> 10:37.638
Thought you like it
when I come to your rescue.

10:37.804 --> 10:40.182
Seems like it,
the way you take unnecessary risks.

10:40.348 --> 10:43.192
When I'm falling out of a plane, rescue me.

10:43.351 --> 10:46.321
Getting ogled by the office pig, I can handle.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.948
It's like everything you do
is to protect poor Lois.

10:49.107 --> 10:51.986
- And what's wrong with that?
- I don't need protecting.

10:52.152 --> 10:53.870
Heads up, guys.

10:54.028 --> 10:57.248
Some kind of thing falling over Arizona.

10:59.742 --> 11:01.665
<i>Reports of an unidentified object...</i>

11:01.828 --> 11:05.332
<i>...currently projected to impact somewhere
in the suburbs north of Phoenix.</i>

11:06.040 --> 11:07.917
- I gotta go.
- Go.

11:08.084 --> 11:10.837
- We'll talk later.
- Go.

12:35.672 --> 12:36.719
Ow.

12:40.009 --> 12:42.262
I actually felt that.

12:55.942 --> 12:57.194
Transmitter.

12:57.360 --> 13:00.204
Uh-uh. No phoning home!

13:24.429 --> 13:26.557
Still can't believe you eat these.

13:26.723 --> 13:27.770
Trust me, honey.

13:27.932 --> 13:30.856
In Kansas,
bacon is one of the major food groups.

13:31.019 --> 13:32.987
Maybe I'll fry you up some in the morning.

13:33.563 --> 13:34.985
That's okay. Heh.

13:35.523 --> 13:38.322
Come on. It's getting buggy out here.

13:40.403 --> 13:43.156
Okay if I lose these?
No one's around for miles.

13:43.323 --> 13:45.041
Sure.

13:46.326 --> 13:49.205
I know Kal means well,
but this is just not me.

13:49.620 --> 13:51.167
Got a feeling you're not going...

13:51.331 --> 13:54.335
...to be around Smallville long enough
to need a secret identity.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.218
I hope I don't seem ungrateful.

13:56.377 --> 13:58.254
Oh, honey, you aren't.

13:58.421 --> 14:01.925
You know Clark.
He always wants what's best for people.

14:02.091 --> 14:04.765
I think he thinks history can repeat itself.

14:04.927 --> 14:06.179
But we're all different.

14:06.346 --> 14:08.565
Pa and I can never substitute
for your parents.

14:08.723 --> 14:11.602
We know that.
For one thing, we're too darn old.

14:11.768 --> 14:13.941
And so are you.

14:15.521 --> 14:17.615
Just know that you're special to us...

14:17.774 --> 14:20.618
...and you'll always have a home here
whenever you need it.

14:20.777 --> 14:22.575
Thanks.

14:24.113 --> 14:28.163
It can get awfully quiet around this place,
but sometimes a person needs that.

14:28.326 --> 14:31.246
<i>... Superman seconds before
it nearly destroyed a home in the high desert.</i>

14:32.288 --> 14:33.460
It works for him.

14:33.623 --> 14:36.968
<i>...Into a robot and attacked the Man of Steel.</i>

14:38.127 --> 14:40.880
<i>We've received this amateur footage
taken of the encounter.</i>

14:41.047 --> 14:42.799
Good lord, what do you suppose...?

14:43.591 --> 14:45.138
Kara?

14:52.308 --> 14:55.061
How far can you zoom in
before we lose detail?

14:55.228 --> 14:57.151
Well, lookie here.

14:58.981 --> 15:00.324
What's she looking for?

15:01.192 --> 15:03.240
Hey, I don't bite.

15:09.826 --> 15:11.828
I think you scared her off.

15:12.995 --> 15:14.588
She'll be back.

15:14.747 --> 15:16.749
They always come back.

15:27.510 --> 15:29.433
Kal?

15:38.980 --> 15:40.982
- Kal, where are you?
- Over here.

15:45.820 --> 15:48.744
Kara, it's just a robot.

15:49.866 --> 15:52.995
- I know. Are there more?
- I don't think so.

15:53.161 --> 15:54.333
Hey, are you okay?

15:54.495 --> 15:58.466
Where's that indestructible kid
I was arguing with a couple of hours ago?

16:02.211 --> 16:04.179
Kara, whatever it is, it's disabled.

16:04.338 --> 16:06.682
It's not going to do any harm.

16:08.676 --> 16:10.849
You're wrong.

16:11.387 --> 16:14.231
- You've seen these before.
- A lot of them.

16:14.390 --> 16:15.562
On Krypton?

16:16.017 --> 16:17.860
In Kandor, the capital.

16:18.019 --> 16:19.316
The day it disappeared.

16:19.479 --> 16:22.073
- A whole city disappeared?
- Taken.

16:22.231 --> 16:26.486
- I don't understand. By who? How?
- It calls itself Brainiac.

16:26.652 --> 16:30.373
We were in Kandor visiting friends
when those things attacked.

16:49.258 --> 16:52.683
<i>The robots were everywhere.
Our army threw everything we had at them...</i>

16:52.845 --> 16:54.722
<i>...but they were unstoppable.</i>

17:03.397 --> 17:04.990
<i>They killed people randomly at first.</i>

17:06.358 --> 17:09.112
<i>Then, as they downloaded our knowledge
and learned about us...</i>

17:09.278 --> 17:11.701
<i>...they figured out who to keep
and who to kill.</i>

17:11.864 --> 17:14.117
<i>Who they found redundant.</i>

17:29.257 --> 17:30.804
Zor-El! Alura!

17:30.967 --> 17:32.969
Kara! Come on!

17:33.469 --> 17:37.440
<i>Our friends tried to help us escape,
but we got separated in the chaos.</i>

17:49.402 --> 17:52.906
<i>We never saw the being inside the ship,
the thing in charge.</i>

17:53.072 --> 17:56.667
<i>I don't think there's anyone alive
outside that ship that has.</i>

18:14.468 --> 18:16.516
No!

18:16.679 --> 18:18.022
Thara! Ak-Var!

18:19.515 --> 18:22.314
You've got to get us out of here,
Zor-El! We can't get out!

18:22.476 --> 18:24.695
Please! Please help us! Please!

18:40.494 --> 18:42.997
<i>Fearing he'd return,
my parents sent me to Earth...</i>

18:43.164 --> 18:48.170
<i>matter my father and other scientists decoded
the memories of robots left behind.</i>

18:48.336 --> 18:50.589
That's how they found out
he was called Brainiac.

18:50.755 --> 18:54.385
They learned from his technology,
planned to find him, fight him.

18:54.550 --> 18:57.053
Get back the people of Kandor.

19:01.223 --> 19:04.397
Hey, hey, it's okay. It's okay.

19:05.811 --> 19:08.735
- We were all so powerless.
- I know.

19:08.898 --> 19:11.902
I never want to feel that way again.
No one should.

19:12.068 --> 19:15.493
But if that thing's here,
it's all going to happen again.

19:15.655 --> 19:17.578
No. I'll make sure it doesn't.

19:18.949 --> 19:22.874
You're going after him, aren't you?
Kal, you don't know what you're dealing with.

19:23.037 --> 19:25.460
These probes must be how he searches
for planets.

19:25.623 --> 19:28.422
And if this one didn't contact him,
someday one will.

19:28.584 --> 19:30.586
I need to finish what your father started.

19:30.753 --> 19:35.179
Isolate this robot's comm signal,
scan for others like it and find Brainiac first.

19:37.009 --> 19:40.263
If you're right, there could be
a hundred thousand Kryptonians alive...

19:40.429 --> 19:43.808
- ...and trapped on that ship.
- And what if he shows up while you're gone?

19:43.974 --> 19:47.103
- What if you never come back?
- You'll have to keep things safe here...

19:47.269 --> 19:48.441
...until I come back.

19:48.604 --> 19:50.857
What makes you think I'm ready to do that?

19:51.399 --> 19:53.242
You'll have to be.

20:04.954 --> 20:08.629
You missed Perry's big announcement.
He's a grandfather.

20:08.791 --> 20:10.338
Keith and his wife had a girl.

20:10.501 --> 20:12.424
They're naming her Alice.

20:12.586 --> 20:13.758
That's great.

20:14.505 --> 20:16.303
I want a normal life, Clark.

20:16.465 --> 20:19.218
I don't know if life with me
is ever going to be normal.

20:19.385 --> 20:22.309
You know what I mean.
I wanna do regular things with you.

20:22.471 --> 20:24.644
Get a place together. Make couple friends.

20:24.807 --> 20:28.437
Someday maybe get married, have kids.
I don't know.

20:28.602 --> 20:32.448
We've talked about this before.
If people ever found out, you'd be in danger.

20:32.606 --> 20:35.280
I'm not talking about people knowing
I'm with Superman.

20:35.443 --> 20:37.741
I'm talking about their knowing
I'm with Clark.

20:37.903 --> 20:40.622
And what if someday people find out
that's the same person?

20:40.781 --> 20:44.160
Then we'll deal with it.
I'm in danger all the time, Clark.

20:44.326 --> 20:46.169
And I'm not thrilled with that either.

20:46.328 --> 20:49.332
Well, what about me?
You think I like sharing you with the world?

20:49.498 --> 20:53.594
Wondering if today's the day some lunatic
finally figures out how to kill you?

20:53.753 --> 20:57.508
But I don't tell you not to do your job,
and you can't tell me not to do mine.

20:57.673 --> 20:59.846
- You can't compare what I...
- Yes, I can.

21:00.009 --> 21:02.762
This fear is your problem, not mine.

21:02.928 --> 21:05.226
You can't keep the world safe for me
all the time.

21:05.389 --> 21:08.268
Not if it's gonna keep us both
from having a life.

21:09.185 --> 21:12.780
- And if you keep insisting...
- Lois, I have to go away for a while.

21:13.814 --> 21:17.193
"Away" as in spend some time
with your folks in Kansas...

21:17.359 --> 21:21.364
...or as in somewhere just past
the Crab Nebula?

21:21.530 --> 21:22.747
More like the latter.

21:22.907 --> 21:25.205
Can we deal with this when I get back?

21:26.202 --> 21:30.173
Men. Always finding an excuse to leave
when things get scary.

21:30.331 --> 21:34.962
Of course, you're the only one who literally
disappears off the face of the earth.

22:03.864 --> 22:06.242
<i>Member Zor-El's report
to the science council.</i>

22:06.408 --> 22:09.662
<i>Although we've stiff found no visual record
of the creature Brainiac...</i>

22:09.829 --> 22:12.753
<i>...we have determined
that he is from a planet called Colu.</i>

22:12.915 --> 22:14.588
<i>Born fully organic...</i>

22:14.750 --> 22:17.674
<i>...Brainiac has incorporated
extensive motor, skeletal...</i>

22:17.837 --> 22:20.181
<i>...and cybernetic enhancements into himself.</i>

22:20.339 --> 22:24.344
<i>His method is to explore the galaxy,
upload knowledge into his own neural core...</i>

22:24.510 --> 22:28.105
<i>...from the worlds he encounters
and then destroy those worlds.</i>

22:28.264 --> 22:32.064
<i>Whether Brainiac has kept the people
of Kandor alive remains a mystery...</i>

22:32.226 --> 22:34.775
<i>...as does why he didn't destroy Krypton.</i>

22:34.937 --> 22:39.909
<i>My brother, Jor-El, has his theories
about our planet nearing its natural end.</i>

22:40.067 --> 22:43.367
<i>Maybe Brainiac detected this
and saved himself the trouble.</i>

22:43.529 --> 22:46.783
<i>Pausing
playback. Frequency match identified.</i>

22:46.949 --> 22:49.122
<i>Star system ahead.</i>

24:14.203 --> 24:17.047
Where's Brainiac? How does this work?

26:28.212 --> 26:29.805
These people were leaving.

26:34.635 --> 26:38.356
I'm new here.
Maybe this will get the message across.

26:48.190 --> 26:50.318
<i>...acquired this video from last night...</i>

26:50.484 --> 26:53.704
<i>...of Supergirl taking on human traffickers
in North Korea.</i>

26:53.862 --> 26:56.206
<i>From Mexican drug lords
to genocide in Africa...</i>

26:56.365 --> 26:58.834
<i>...Supergirl seems to be
on a one-heroine rampage...</i>

26:58.992 --> 27:00.665
<i>...during Superman's absence.</i>

27:00.828 --> 27:03.047
Yeah. Everywhere but here.

27:03.205 --> 27:07.130
Why does Superman disappear for weeks
like this? Maybe there's an angle in it.

27:07.292 --> 27:10.637
Does he wanna make sure
the human race stays self-sufficient?

27:10.796 --> 27:16.018
- Are there other worlds he protects?
- You mean, like, he's cheating on us?

27:16.385 --> 27:19.730
Let's play with it.
"The Aloofness of Superman."

27:19.888 --> 27:21.310
Lois, you run with this.

27:21.473 --> 27:25.068
- Must I?
- Who else am I gonna give it to? Kent?

27:25.227 --> 27:26.854
He's probably cheating on us too.

27:35.028 --> 27:36.280
<i>Cataloging.</i>

27:36.446 --> 27:37.868
<i>Planet Larroo.</i>

27:38.031 --> 27:41.035
<i>Three sentient species identified.</i>

27:41.201 --> 27:43.545
<i>Stand by.</i>

27:44.621 --> 27:46.544
<i>Knowledge has been uploaded.</i>

27:46.707 --> 27:49.711
<i>Specimen analysis underway. Stand by.</i>

27:54.214 --> 27:55.682
<i>Specimen active.</i>

27:55.841 --> 27:58.435
<i>Sending units to subdue.</i>

28:24.828 --> 28:27.047
<i>Specimen analysis complete.</i>

28:27.206 --> 28:28.799
<i>Storing specimens.</i>

29:20.342 --> 29:22.686
The Milky Way.

29:22.844 --> 29:25.768
He's placed each city according
to the planet it came from.

29:25.931 --> 29:27.274
Then Krypton would be...

29:46.702 --> 29:48.204
Kandor.

29:48.704 --> 29:50.706
Kara was right.

30:03.552 --> 30:07.147
Really?
Put yourself in the center of the galaxy?

30:07.306 --> 30:09.650
A little egocentric, aren't we?

30:11.310 --> 30:14.735
So you must be Brainiac.

30:15.605 --> 30:17.403
Okay.

30:19.526 --> 30:20.698
Identify.

30:21.737 --> 30:23.239
Try asking nice.

30:25.115 --> 30:26.662
Kryptonian.

30:26.825 --> 30:29.829
Not big on people skills, are you?

30:39.713 --> 30:44.059
- You should not exist outside my control.
- Sorry to disappoint.

30:51.933 --> 30:56.313
I did not destroy Krypton
after uploading my specimens...

30:56.480 --> 31:00.280
...because the planet
was about to destroy itself.

31:00.442 --> 31:05.994
You exist because I allowed you to be.

31:06.156 --> 31:07.954
Hope you're not expecting a thank you.

31:08.116 --> 31:10.619
- It was an error.
- Got that right.

31:13.163 --> 31:15.712
What are you? Who made you God?

31:15.874 --> 31:19.219
You ask me such questions?

31:22.297 --> 31:24.299
Ridiculous.

31:24.758 --> 31:29.389
I am the knowledge and strength
of 10,000 worlds.

31:29.554 --> 31:34.481
I am flesh and machine.
I am becoming everything.

31:34.643 --> 31:40.776
And you, your arrival is no more
than a rare opportunity for entertainment.

31:40.941 --> 31:45.242
And it presents me the opportunity
to correct that error.

31:45.404 --> 31:48.874
You shall be integrated
into Krypton's specimen city...

31:49.032 --> 31:50.659
...where you belong.

31:51.576 --> 31:52.668
No, thanks.

31:53.829 --> 31:59.427
It was not a request.
Your struggle is pathetic. You are weak.

31:59.584 --> 32:05.842
Your mind has been fully scanned.
Your skills and limitations are mine to read.

32:07.509 --> 32:08.852
Ah...

32:10.053 --> 32:13.774
You've been living on another planet
with intelligent life.

32:13.932 --> 32:15.024
Earth.

32:17.227 --> 32:22.358
The Kryptonian rocket I found adrift, yours.

32:23.275 --> 32:24.618
Yes.

32:24.776 --> 32:28.030
Its guidance system
contains Earth's location.

32:28.697 --> 32:34.454
<i>New acquisition
planet entered in database. Changing course.</i>

32:34.619 --> 32:37.839
<i>Preparing environmental simulator.</i>

32:37.998 --> 32:39.215
No!

32:42.961 --> 32:45.555
You have brought me another gift,
Kryptonian.

32:45.714 --> 32:49.309
Perhaps letting you live
was not such an error after all.

33:06.902 --> 33:08.745
Kandor.

33:16.453 --> 33:18.922
Jim, you still got that watch
Superman gave you?

33:19.080 --> 33:21.879
- Sure, but I don't think it...
- Can't hurt to give it a shot.

33:28.048 --> 33:30.676
Ms. Lane, if Superman were around,
he'd have responded...

33:30.842 --> 33:34.312
...to that hijacked freighter the other day,
and the fire over on Third.

33:34.471 --> 33:35.939
Ow!

33:36.389 --> 33:38.107
What is that noise?

33:39.935 --> 33:41.858
Oh, sorry.

33:44.606 --> 33:47.860
Okay, Jimmy, Supergirl. Supergirl, Jimmy.
Thanks for your help, Jim.

33:48.026 --> 33:51.451
- You meant to call her?
- Yup. Keep this between us, okay?

33:51.947 --> 33:53.620
Sure.

33:57.327 --> 34:01.628
- Okay. I'm here. What?
- What's your rush?

34:01.790 --> 34:04.634
All right, look, you and I don't know
each other, well, yet...

34:04.793 --> 34:08.422
...and I'm guessing Superman didn't tell you,
but it's okay to talk to me.

34:08.588 --> 34:13.639
I know about him being Clark.
I'm his girlfriend.

34:14.302 --> 34:16.179
He didn't tell me.

34:16.346 --> 34:19.270
Yeah, well, that's Clark.
It took him a year to tell his folks.

34:19.431 --> 34:22.481
Here's the thing. While everyone else
is singing tributes to you...

34:22.643 --> 34:24.521
...for kicking butt all over the world...

34:24.688 --> 34:27.065
They were bullies.
Bullies should be punished.

34:27.232 --> 34:32.489
Right. Right on, sister. But in the meantime,
I think you've been avoiding Metropolis.

34:32.654 --> 34:34.656
So, what do you know that we don't?

34:35.364 --> 34:37.663
And what does it have to do with Superman?

34:38.284 --> 34:42.835
- He cares about you? He'd want you to live.
- I think that's the general idea.

34:42.998 --> 34:44.795
Then get out of Metropolis.

34:44.958 --> 34:48.178
Stay with the Kents in Smallville,
somewhere he can find you after.

34:48.335 --> 34:49.838
"After"? After what?

34:50.005 --> 34:53.976
Remember that thing that fell from space
just before he went away?

34:54.134 --> 34:55.181
Uh-huh.

34:55.342 --> 35:00.725
- It was a probe. A scout.
- And he's gone to find whoever sent it?

35:00.890 --> 35:02.016
Brainiac.

35:02.183 --> 35:05.027
Because, otherwise,
this Brainiac will come here.

35:05.186 --> 35:07.860
And Metropolis is just the kind of city
he'll take.

35:08.023 --> 35:11.869
Take? Like a souvenir?
And, what, you're planning to let him?

35:12.027 --> 35:16.703
- Kal's out there trying to stop him.
- Well, you don't sound very confident.

35:17.157 --> 35:21.663
If Kal fails, there's nothing I'd be able to do.

35:21.828 --> 35:26.208
- So you're not even gonna try?
- I'm sorry. I'm not saying it's right.

35:26.374 --> 35:31.050
I just lived through it once already
and I can't do it again.

35:33.882 --> 35:36.010
It must have been the worst day of your life.

35:36.593 --> 35:37.640
Hm.

35:37.802 --> 35:40.305
I forget you're still just...

35:40.472 --> 35:44.852
I'm not used to someone with powers
like his being scared.

35:45.018 --> 35:46.691
Or showing it, anyway.

35:46.853 --> 35:49.072
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

35:49.230 --> 35:54.657
- I know I'm not supposed to show it.
- Kara, it's okay.

35:57.864 --> 36:00.413
There's this Somali warlord.

36:00.950 --> 36:01.997
Go.

36:10.794 --> 36:12.262
Get me the Pentagon.

36:21.554 --> 36:24.433
- Hello.
- Excuse me.

36:46.746 --> 36:49.124
A red sun.

36:49.290 --> 36:52.794
I don't have much time. What's the closest
way to the edge of the city?

36:53.962 --> 36:56.090
We don't go near the edge of the city.

36:56.631 --> 36:59.805
Did you come from Krypton?
Are things all right there?

36:59.968 --> 37:01.936
I'm sorry, I'll get you all out of here...

37:02.095 --> 37:04.439
...but right now I have to get myself out
and fast.

37:04.597 --> 37:07.771
Please. You can't say such things.
They'll come.

37:07.934 --> 37:10.403
Do you realize where you are?
You're prisoners.

37:10.562 --> 37:12.985
This whole city is inside a ship.

37:13.148 --> 37:16.618
<i>Dispatching sentries. Dispatching sentries.</i>

37:17.318 --> 37:20.572
<i>Citizens, your conversation
has become subversive.</i>

37:20.739 --> 37:22.412
<i>Please modulate accordingly.</i>

37:22.574 --> 37:25.498
Uh, yes, of course.
Heh, heh, the new one doesn't know.

37:26.077 --> 37:28.626
They keep you in line?

37:30.290 --> 37:32.292
Hey, talk to me this time.

37:41.968 --> 37:44.596
<i>Retrieving sentries.</i>

37:46.931 --> 37:50.231
I'm losing my strength.
I need to get out of here while I still can.

37:50.393 --> 37:54.523
I'm sorry, there's no escaping.
We all tried long ago.

37:54.689 --> 37:57.613
Eventually we accepted and so will you.

37:57.776 --> 38:00.154
You had to have been children
when it happened.

38:00.320 --> 38:02.618
No. No one ages here.

38:02.781 --> 38:05.204
We've all been the same age
since we were captured.

38:05.366 --> 38:07.368
Even...?

38:07.535 --> 38:09.583
That's over 30 years ago.

38:09.746 --> 38:14.001
Tell us. How is Krypton?
We feared it was destroyed.

38:15.043 --> 38:18.172
It was. I'm sorry.

38:19.297 --> 38:22.096
Then the arrivals from Argo City were right.

38:22.258 --> 38:23.635
Arrivals from Argo City?

38:23.802 --> 38:27.352
They appeared the same way you did,
a short time after Brainiac took Kandor.

38:28.640 --> 38:31.860
Was there a couple with them
named Zor-El and Alura?

38:35.021 --> 38:38.901
Great Rao, he looks just like his father.

38:43.238 --> 38:47.994
- Unbelievable. I'm eating Kryptonian food.
- Close enough.

38:48.159 --> 38:52.209
We don't have soil to grow food.
No springs for fresh water.

38:52.372 --> 38:56.673
Brainiac gives us everything we need
and nothing more.

38:56.835 --> 39:00.430
Enough of that.
Please tell us more about Kara.

39:01.005 --> 39:03.804
She's having some trouble adjusting
to a new world...

39:03.967 --> 39:05.514
...but she'll be all right.

39:05.677 --> 39:09.272
- And you? How did you adjust?
- Well, for me it was easier.

39:09.430 --> 39:13.776
It's the only world I know.
I have family and friends and...

39:13.935 --> 39:15.687
Someone special.

39:17.230 --> 39:18.903
Drives me nuts sometimes.

39:19.065 --> 39:22.786
Heh. Nice to know
that's the same everywhere.

39:22.944 --> 39:24.412
So how did you end up here?

39:24.571 --> 39:27.950
We were studying Brainiac's probes
for information on him.

39:28.116 --> 39:31.290
Adapting our technology
so we could find him and fight him.

39:31.452 --> 39:34.626
We think by doing so we attracted him back.

39:35.081 --> 39:38.335
He watches us constantly,
listens to every word.

39:38.501 --> 39:41.300
This conversation right now is subversive.

39:41.462 --> 39:43.760
It's so you'll never escape.

39:44.299 --> 39:45.300
It's more than that.

39:45.466 --> 39:49.972
I think it's a bug in his programming.
That cyborg core inside him.

39:50.138 --> 39:53.642
It wants to know everything there is to know
in the galaxy.

39:53.808 --> 39:56.607
- So he said.
- But that's impossible.

39:56.769 --> 39:57.941
Worlds are living things.

39:58.104 --> 40:00.448
Their knowledge is always growing
and changing.

40:00.607 --> 40:05.488
So he has to stop them.
Turn them into these fake versions instead.

40:05.653 --> 40:10.454
You can't control a living thing
without destroying what's alive about it.

40:13.244 --> 40:15.963
So his whole system is a lie.

40:16.122 --> 40:20.093
- Brainiac is headed for Earth. I need to...
- Kara's in danger.

40:20.251 --> 40:24.973
We would do anything. But what is there?
We have no tools, no way to escape.

40:25.131 --> 40:26.599
He's made sure of that.

40:27.175 --> 40:29.724
Maybe we can use his own tools
against him.

40:33.848 --> 40:37.603
Hey, Brainiac,
I've still got some punch left in me.

40:56.371 --> 40:58.715
What's underneath this street?

40:58.873 --> 41:01.376
You have machines
to keep this facade going?

41:08.091 --> 41:09.809
He wants the robots to come.

41:13.805 --> 41:17.150
<i>Citizen, your behavior
has become subversive.</i>

41:20.061 --> 41:23.190
<i>Cease your activity at once
before we are forced to...</i>

41:26.401 --> 41:27.869
Hey.

41:31.447 --> 41:33.666
Subvert that.

41:34.450 --> 41:36.748
<i>Retrieving damaged sentries.</i>

41:40.707 --> 41:43.756
I'll be back for you, I promise.

42:20.872 --> 42:22.545
Hey, ugly.

42:31.090 --> 42:33.718
- Fool.
- Shut up.

42:40.183 --> 42:43.778
This won't hold you forever.
It just needs to hold you long enough.

42:44.353 --> 42:46.651
You underestimate me.

42:46.814 --> 42:52.662
You'll die and your new world will be mine
just like your old world is.

42:52.820 --> 42:54.822
You're meaningless compared to me.

42:54.989 --> 42:58.744
I am everything. You are nothing but fists.

43:04.082 --> 43:06.426
When I need to be.

43:10.630 --> 43:12.803
The engine room.

44:24.245 --> 44:28.671
Ma, Pa, he's home. Clark's come home.

45:41.489 --> 45:45.244
Kal. Kal? Did you find him?

45:46.911 --> 45:49.164
- I did.
- Tell me he's dead.

45:49.330 --> 45:53.176
I disabled him for now. Marooned his ship.

45:54.835 --> 45:59.841
- Kal, that's not good enough.
- His ship had thousands of cities on it.

46:00.007 --> 46:01.133
Millions of lives.

46:01.300 --> 46:04.429
They all need to be freed
and found new planets to live on.

46:05.137 --> 46:07.310
Then he did keep the cities.

46:13.604 --> 46:17.029
They're alive. Thara, all those people.

46:17.858 --> 46:21.704
That's not all.
Kara, your parents are in there too.

46:21.862 --> 46:25.162
I spent time with them.
They can't wait to see you.

46:25.324 --> 46:27.201
How? What do we do?

46:27.368 --> 46:30.747
I know a habitable planet
with a red sun like Krypton's.

46:30.913 --> 46:32.381
You and I will take them there.

46:36.043 --> 46:37.886
What is it?

46:40.923 --> 46:43.017
Something's happening in Metropolis.

46:46.929 --> 46:48.727
What is that?

46:55.313 --> 46:57.566
- Hey!
- Hey, what's going on?

47:16.542 --> 47:18.044
No.

47:18.210 --> 47:20.554
It's happening here.

47:20.713 --> 47:22.260
It's happening again.

47:52.203 --> 47:53.625
Have a seat, butt head.

48:05.966 --> 48:08.435
Come on, move it.

48:09.470 --> 48:10.596
We have to go.

48:11.806 --> 48:14.855
- I can't.
- I need your help.

48:15.017 --> 48:19.648
We'll take Kandor, we'll take my parents,
find that other planet like you said.

48:19.814 --> 48:24.285
Kara. If you run, he'll never stop.
But here on Earth you have powers.

48:24.443 --> 48:28.164
This is your chance to fight back.
We can beat him.

49:08.904 --> 49:09.996
No.

49:27.715 --> 49:30.059
Could be the end of the world, Lane.

49:30.217 --> 49:33.721
- You and me. You wanna hook up?
- Not a chance.

50:15.513 --> 50:17.106
Superman!

52:06.332 --> 52:08.005
Lois.

52:58.842 --> 53:00.264
The impudence.

53:00.427 --> 53:04.807
I have been claiming worlds
for centuries before you were born.

53:04.973 --> 53:08.568
You thought it would help you
to disconnect me from my ship.

53:08.727 --> 53:12.903
You fail to comprehend. This ship is me.

53:13.065 --> 53:15.568
Constructed around me.

53:15.734 --> 53:18.453
An extension of me.

53:20.447 --> 53:21.790
Earth.

53:21.949 --> 53:23.872
Forget Earth.

53:24.034 --> 53:26.253
- It was unexceptional.
- Aah!

53:26.412 --> 53:28.631
It had nothing to offer me.

53:30.249 --> 53:32.593
I found it redundant.

53:34.294 --> 53:35.762
Lois.

53:35.921 --> 53:37.468
Disgusting.

53:37.631 --> 53:40.305
Your affection for humans is nauseating.

53:44.054 --> 53:45.601
Kara.

53:50.811 --> 53:51.903
Yes.

53:52.062 --> 53:54.656
The other Kryptonian, I will keep.

53:54.815 --> 53:56.817
I'll need at least one.

54:00.154 --> 54:02.828
And you may not survive.

54:09.329 --> 54:12.674
Now you will see a glimpse
of what I am.

54:12.833 --> 54:15.928
How many worlds do you think
your feeble mind can process...

54:16.086 --> 54:18.635
...before it turns to sludge?

54:18.797 --> 54:20.799
I'd say less than one.

54:30.350 --> 54:32.773
Good. Fight it.

54:36.857 --> 54:42.614
I need your brain to function long enough
to tell me one more thing.

54:43.489 --> 54:45.787
Where you've put Kandor.

54:49.286 --> 54:50.458
Oh.

54:51.371 --> 54:55.547
<i>Changing course for planet's North Pole.</i>

55:02.174 --> 55:04.893
- Then you haven't destroyed Earth.
- Soon.

55:05.052 --> 55:07.100
And Metropolis?

55:10.057 --> 55:11.730
Here.

55:11.892 --> 55:13.565
But not for long.

55:19.733 --> 55:23.078
Your sentimental attachment is grotesque.

55:23.237 --> 55:25.660
Even you must realize
how worthless they are.

55:26.949 --> 55:29.327
Such a savage world.

55:29.493 --> 55:34.795
Its scientific achievements paltry.
Its weapons unimpressive.

55:41.171 --> 55:47.099
To think that two Kryptonians chose
to call this planet home, sickens me.

55:47.261 --> 55:50.356
What could Earth
have possibly offered you?

55:52.349 --> 55:55.478
Something you wouldn't know
anything about.

55:57.437 --> 55:59.610
It's my home.

55:59.773 --> 56:01.616
My heart.

56:02.776 --> 56:04.619
It gives me strength.

56:33.974 --> 56:36.068
Go to hell.

56:49.156 --> 56:51.329
Kara, wake up.

56:54.870 --> 56:56.292
Kal?

56:56.872 --> 57:00.092
- Is this his ship?
- It's all right.

57:00.250 --> 57:01.672
We're inside Brainiac's.

57:01.835 --> 57:06.261
<i>Kryptonian trash, you have already failed.</i>

57:07.507 --> 57:12.183
<i>I am the knowledge and strength
of 10,000 worlds.</i>

57:12.846 --> 57:16.851
<i>Neither you nor Metropolis
will ever leave this ship.</i>

57:22.814 --> 57:24.691
Soon I will have Kandor...

57:24.858 --> 57:29.034
...and then I will destroy your world
with a thought.

57:29.446 --> 57:33.371
- We'll see about that.
- You will see nothing.

57:33.533 --> 57:35.877
You are nothing.

57:36.036 --> 57:39.882
A specimen to dissect. A genus to analyze...

57:40.040 --> 57:41.713
Hey, plug-head.

57:43.377 --> 57:45.721
You talk too much.

58:23.667 --> 58:26.671
- Aah!
- Unh!

58:36.388 --> 58:37.890
Kal.

58:39.224 --> 58:41.943
<i>Initiating Solar Aggressor.</i>

58:42.102 --> 58:45.322
<i>Launching Solar Aggressor.</i>

58:52.904 --> 58:54.872
That's a missile. It's headed for the sun.

58:55.032 --> 58:58.286
If it gets there, Earth will be destroyed
and Kandor with it.

58:59.411 --> 59:00.458
On it.

59:06.418 --> 59:07.920
Enough!

59:08.086 --> 59:10.259
I will forego Kandor.

59:10.422 --> 59:12.470
I have Krypton's knowledge.

59:12.632 --> 59:16.136
And for a specimen, you will do.

59:58.178 --> 01:00:01.728
All of your efforts have been futile.

01:00:03.642 --> 01:00:07.146
Even if she catches the missile,
I'll fire another.

01:00:10.690 --> 01:00:12.158
I've figured you out, you know?

01:00:13.735 --> 01:00:15.612
Have you?

01:00:15.779 --> 01:00:18.532
I find that highly unlikely.

01:00:18.698 --> 01:00:20.541
You never leave this ship.

01:00:21.076 --> 01:00:22.953
There is no need.

01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:24.997
Everything I require is here.

01:00:26.873 --> 01:00:28.875
My uncle was right.

01:00:29.042 --> 01:00:31.090
You've got a bug.

01:00:31.878 --> 01:00:35.758
Very well, Kryptonian. I'll humor you.

01:00:35.924 --> 01:00:37.551
Tell me.

01:00:38.093 --> 01:00:39.720
Better if I show you.

01:01:45.744 --> 01:01:48.463
I saw it when I was inside Kandor.

01:01:51.666 --> 01:01:55.671
I saw it when you were downloading
your worlds into my head.

01:02:14.314 --> 01:02:18.820
You don't really know these worlds. You only
know your safe, bottled versions of them.

01:02:37.504 --> 01:02:41.850
You have data, scientific knowledge.
But you have no real sense of life.

01:02:42.550 --> 01:02:43.642
Huh?

01:02:45.387 --> 01:02:46.434
Hm?

01:02:46.596 --> 01:02:48.849
That. You hear it?

01:02:50.850 --> 01:02:54.195
It's a highway 50 miles from here.

01:02:55.855 --> 01:02:59.701
The fall leaves rustling.
A small plane taking off.

01:02:59.859 --> 01:03:02.738
Little kids playing in their backyard.

01:03:02.904 --> 01:03:05.032
The smell of fresh bread
in someone's kitchen.

01:03:05.198 --> 01:03:07.041
Dragonflies in the air.

01:03:08.368 --> 01:03:09.870
You hear it all too?

01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:12.543
You see it all? Huh.

01:03:13.164 --> 01:03:14.381
Something, ain't it?

01:03:19.421 --> 01:03:22.015
All this activity.

01:03:22.173 --> 01:03:24.551
All this chaos. Oh!

01:03:26.052 --> 01:03:29.397
How do you block it out? Unh.

01:03:30.724 --> 01:03:33.898
I learned to live with it.
But you can't, can you?

01:03:34.060 --> 01:03:36.233
You can't face things you can't control.

01:03:48.908 --> 01:03:52.253
Ah. And that is mud.

01:03:59.836 --> 01:04:04.012
Look at it.
Bugs, and worms and bacteria.

01:04:04.174 --> 01:04:05.767
You see them?

01:04:06.217 --> 01:04:07.764
Smell them?

01:04:09.554 --> 01:04:11.101
Feel them?

01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:16.774
The high and mighty Brainiac.

01:04:16.936 --> 01:04:19.940
- No. Get it off. Get away!
- All that need to control everything.

01:04:20.106 --> 01:04:22.950
To know everything.
Your giant brain can't take it.

01:04:24.861 --> 01:04:28.035
Hiding in that little ship of yours
like a coward.

01:04:35.288 --> 01:04:36.961
It's made you weak.

01:05:51.156 --> 01:05:52.999
Attagirl.

01:07:07.941 --> 01:07:09.784
Welcome to Earth.

01:08:26.352 --> 01:08:28.821
All right! Yeah!

01:09:16.444 --> 01:09:18.196
Kara.

01:09:34.962 --> 01:09:37.430
- Here.
- Thank you.

01:09:52.354 --> 01:09:55.029
Mm! Mm. Mm.

01:10:01.114 --> 01:10:05.961
- I thought I'd lost you.
- Funny. I was here the whole time.

01:10:18.131 --> 01:10:20.054
It's okay.

01:10:21.759 --> 01:10:23.602
You were right.

01:10:24.554 --> 01:10:27.433
- I knew it.
- Sure you did.

01:10:28.141 --> 01:10:31.941
I thought I wanted a world
where I could always keep you safe.

01:10:33.688 --> 01:10:35.611
And you don't want that anymore?

01:10:36.315 --> 01:10:38.113
That's not what I meant.

01:10:38.609 --> 01:10:42.239
Because right now I could use a little safety.

01:10:44.365 --> 01:10:47.460
All you want, I promise.

01:10:48.327 --> 01:10:51.672
I don't ever wanna stop you from being you.

01:10:51.831 --> 01:10:55.131
- You know you're rambling.
- I know.

01:10:55.293 --> 01:10:59.639
- Not that I mind.
- I thought you'd like it.

01:11:00.673 --> 01:11:02.175
So, what do you want?

01:11:11.476 --> 01:11:12.853
Marry me.
