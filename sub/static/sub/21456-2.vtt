01:34.320 --> 01:36.152
Here, Mrs Flora.

01:36.200 --> 01:38.750
Ooh! Mmm.

01:38.880 --> 01:41.794
Thank you. Bless you, Rita.

01:53.280 --> 01:54.475
Now he's had his boosters,

01:54.480 --> 01:56.950
you can take him to the park
so he can play with his friends,

01:56.960 --> 01:59.748
and if you ask Amanda nicely,

01:59.760 --> 02:02.548
she'll give him a treat 'cause
he's being brave, all right?

02:02.640 --> 02:03.640
Go on.

02:03.960 --> 02:06.145
Er, Myra Nicholson?
- That's me.

02:07.240 --> 02:09.471
But you can call me Steve.

02:17.520 --> 02:21.060
Hello, Myra, there we go.

02:22.440 --> 02:23.440
Okay.

02:37.720 --> 02:41.988
19's a good age, but
her heart's giving out.

02:42.000 --> 02:46.143
We should put her to sleep
to spare her suffering.

02:49.200 --> 02:51.784
I hadn't realised how long I'd...

02:52.680 --> 02:54.353
Do you need a moment?

02:54.360 --> 02:55.589
No, it's fine.

03:04.600 --> 03:06.672
I hadn't expected to...

03:13.640 --> 03:14.640
Bloody cat.

03:16.720 --> 03:19.304
She resented me from the start.

03:21.600 --> 03:22.600
I'm sorry.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.707
Oh, yes, yes.

04:00.200 --> 04:01.998
I'm off now, Mrs Flora.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.062
- Goodnight.
- Buona notte.

04:05.080 --> 04:07.356
I left shepherd's pie
and broccoli for you.

04:07.360 --> 04:09.386
I turn it down so it doesn't dry out.

04:09.400 --> 04:11.312
Ah. You spoil me.

04:19.120 --> 04:21.146
- Home at last, Adam.
- Night, Rita.

04:21.160 --> 04:22.788
All good with my granny?

04:22.800 --> 04:24.507
Same old, same old.

04:25.960 --> 04:29.864
Well you could take
the food out of the oven.

04:38.840 --> 04:40.832
I love your plate warmer.

04:40.840 --> 04:43.594
Oh, don't you mock me.

04:43.600 --> 04:45.432
It's generational.

04:45.440 --> 04:48.274
My generation has toast
racks and plate warmers,

04:48.320 --> 04:52.782
and yours has double espresso
machines and dating apps.

04:54.160 --> 04:55.992
How do you know about dating apps?

04:56.000 --> 04:59.232
Well you know, Rita's my Google.

04:59.240 --> 05:03.337
By the way, that jacket needs
to go to the dry cleaners.

05:03.360 --> 05:04.794
Something on the shoulder.

05:04.800 --> 05:06.394
Really?

05:06.400 --> 05:07.550
On the back.

05:15.040 --> 05:16.793
I do hope this is all right.

05:16.800 --> 05:18.792
She always over-seasons.

05:21.280 --> 05:23.465
You're looking a bit flushed.

05:23.480 --> 05:24.480
It's, er...

05:25.360 --> 05:26.555
It's London.
- Hmm.

05:27.560 --> 05:30.667
You're like me, I hate crowds.

05:30.680 --> 05:32.353
Am I like you?

05:32.360 --> 05:33.714
Of course you are.

05:37.040 --> 05:40.306
Dinner with Claudie next
week before her twins arrive.

05:40.320 --> 05:42.870
Oh!

05:44.800 --> 05:45.870
Well...

05:46.120 --> 05:49.626
she'll make a better
mother than I ever did.

05:49.640 --> 05:51.950
You did all right with me.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.984
Well, I was lucky. Fate gave me
a second chance.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.390
My bridge cronies are always asking me,

06:02.400 --> 06:05.712
when is he going to settle down?

06:05.720 --> 06:06.870
I say to them,

06:07.840 --> 06:11.425
you know some of us
prefer our own company.

06:11.440 --> 06:13.432
That's what I tell them.

06:54.800 --> 06:57.714
Hi, it's Adam again from
the vet's, I've brought...

07:10.640 --> 07:13.144
You'd better come in.

07:13.160 --> 07:14.788
Hi, I was expecting Steve.

07:14.800 --> 07:17.862
Of course you were, but I'm Caspar.

07:20.120 --> 07:21.236
Do you live here too?

07:21.240 --> 07:23.152
I do rather.

07:26.240 --> 07:27.754
Oh, is that..?

07:27.760 --> 07:30.150
Yes, sorry. Had to
happen when you were away.

07:30.160 --> 07:31.640
Hmm. Well...

07:31.680 --> 07:34.264
I have to nip to the
post but you'll find Steve

07:34.280 --> 07:37.421
in his study, in need of distraction.

07:46.240 --> 07:47.240
Hello?

07:57.120 --> 07:59.908
- You can't leave them there.
- Oh.

07:59.920 --> 08:00.920
Hi.

08:01.680 --> 08:03.512
Caspar'd have a fit.

08:04.760 --> 08:06.239
Sorry, I...

08:06.240 --> 08:08.744
I just thought I'd drop off Myra's ashes

08:08.760 --> 08:09.989
on my way home.

08:15.800 --> 08:18.463
I thought the box was quite nice.

08:18.480 --> 08:19.959
Yeah.

08:19.960 --> 08:21.838
But it's not Biedermeier.

08:21.840 --> 08:23.468
Caspar's been known to change hotels

08:23.480 --> 08:25.552
if the carpet upsets him.

08:30.760 --> 08:33.070
What are you working on?

08:33.080 --> 08:36.745
A redesign of a perfect
flat in Limehouse.

08:36.760 --> 08:38.751
All my work gets undone.

08:39.720 --> 08:43.703
If you heal a dog, right, it stays healed.

08:43.720 --> 08:47.863
Unhappy people can have
persistently unhappy pets.

08:50.160 --> 08:52.072
So you're an architect.

08:52.160 --> 08:54.152
Oh, um...

08:54.160 --> 08:58.223
Caspar swept me off my feet
before I qualified.

09:01.160 --> 09:03.948
This place is really quite nice.

09:05.040 --> 09:06.872
Your 10 minute call.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.231
I'm sorry, um...

09:22.920 --> 09:25.948
So Tracey and thingy want more bubbly

09:25.960 --> 09:28.111
and Gavin wants another
glass of that stuff he likes.

09:28.120 --> 09:29.748
Okay. Riesling

09:29.880 --> 09:32.270
You know, the one with the...

09:32.280 --> 09:34.238
- Hey.
- He-ey!

09:36.800 --> 09:39.236
- You are vast.
- I'm a whale.

09:39.240 --> 09:40.594
Twins. Nightmare.

09:40.600 --> 09:42.080
What am I saying, it's brilliant.

09:42.081 --> 09:43.150
It suits you.

09:43.160 --> 09:44.080
Well, thank God it turns him on

09:44.081 --> 09:46.835
because it's made me so horny.

09:46.840 --> 09:48.547
So, umm...

09:48.920 --> 09:49.990
What?

09:50.000 --> 09:51.628
I wanted to see you properly

09:51.640 --> 09:53.188
but I've done that thing again.

09:53.200 --> 09:54.429
I thought it was just gonna be us.

09:54.440 --> 09:57.468
Yeah, I know but there's
someone I want you to meet.

09:57.480 --> 09:58.480
Hi, David.

09:59.800 --> 10:02.941
His name's Dwight, and he teaches drama.

10:06.560 --> 10:08.108
- So, Adrian.
- Adam.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.436
Yeah. How do you know David?

10:11.440 --> 10:14.024
Claudie was my girlfriend at uni.

10:14.040 --> 10:16.510
Oh. But I thought you were...

10:18.800 --> 10:20.553
Yeah, I am.

10:20.560 --> 10:22.074
I turned him.

10:24.720 --> 10:26.678
I love how relaxed you Brits are.

10:26.680 --> 10:30.140
I was told you'd all be
uptight and judgemental.

10:37.560 --> 10:40.428
And two doubles with an over-trick. Oh!

10:40.440 --> 10:43.547
That's, oh, I can't work it out.

10:43.560 --> 10:47.464
With all this excitement,
I've just got to pee.

10:52.640 --> 10:55.588
They've been on two dates now.

10:55.600 --> 10:56.750
What, to the theatre?

10:56.760 --> 10:59.070
No, to a hotel.

10:59.520 --> 11:01.318
She's on some pills.

11:01.320 --> 11:03.904
Certainly helps her card play.

11:03.920 --> 11:06.071
I don't understand.

11:06.080 --> 11:10.621
It was such a relief when
I could quietly give up.

11:10.640 --> 11:12.916
But your Michael died so young.

11:12.920 --> 11:14.468
He was 60.

11:14.480 --> 11:15.320
Yes, but...

11:15.321 --> 11:17.597
Oh, I'm just not wired that way.

11:17.600 --> 11:18.920
Never have been.

11:37.440 --> 11:38.510
Hey.

11:38.760 --> 11:39.910
Hey.

11:39.920 --> 11:41.627
We've hardly spoken.

11:41.640 --> 11:44.906
Yeah, will you make my
apologies, this is my round.

11:44.920 --> 11:47.276
No, it's me you apologise to.

11:47.280 --> 11:50.114
He better be worth it, let me see.

11:51.480 --> 11:53.472
Yeah, and his face.
- Oh.

11:56.400 --> 11:58.426
Oh yeah, he's hotter than Dwight.

11:58.440 --> 11:59.510
That voice.

11:59.520 --> 12:00.954
It'd be like sleeping with a chainsaw.

12:00.960 --> 12:01.960
Sorry.

12:03.400 --> 12:05.984
I worry about you, that could be anyone.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.072
Is that the cock of a serial killer?

12:08.080 --> 12:09.434
This is so not okay.

12:09.440 --> 12:10.799
You are leaving a table of friends,

12:10.800 --> 12:12.159
just to fuck a complete stranger.

12:12.160 --> 12:13.788
You used to envy me
and now you're judging.

12:13.800 --> 12:15.473
Hell yes, I'm judging.

12:15.480 --> 12:16.800
It's not cool, it's just weird.

12:16.840 --> 12:19.628
I will give you a full report.

12:21.080 --> 12:25.302
I'm not sure I want you to be godfather.

13:06.480 --> 13:07.480
Oh, sorry.

13:08.600 --> 13:10.876
Yeah...

13:18.360 --> 13:19.360
You're...

13:19.800 --> 13:21.712
You're very passionate.

13:22.880 --> 13:23.916
Sorry.

13:23.920 --> 13:27.061
No, no, don't be stupid, it was hot.

13:28.200 --> 13:30.863
What did you say your name was again?

13:30.880 --> 13:31.880
I didn't.

13:34.520 --> 13:37.752
- I'm Bruno.
- Hello, Bruno.

13:40.880 --> 13:43.862
I'd like to do that again.

13:46.560 --> 13:48.392
Anything's possible.

13:54.280 --> 13:57.592
Sorry, but after that I need
to go and use the bathroom,

13:57.600 --> 14:00.662
so just play some music or something.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.878
Where have you gone now?

14:40.880 --> 14:43.862
I'm just fixing your router.

14:43.880 --> 14:45.553
Can't it wait?

14:45.560 --> 14:47.632
I'm almost done.

14:47.640 --> 14:50.428
That's really kind of you
to get all that kit for me.

14:50.440 --> 14:53.069
But, really, apart from the emails,

14:53.080 --> 14:55.072
I never use the internet.

14:55.080 --> 14:56.674
I know, but I do.

14:57.640 --> 15:01.828
Well then, you sit down,
eat, while it's still warm.

15:28.320 --> 15:30.392
Oh no, not again.

15:30.400 --> 15:32.585
She puts chilli in all the time.

15:32.600 --> 15:34.273
Poor Rita, it's fine.

15:34.280 --> 15:36.909
So, something important, you said.
- Mmm.

15:37.920 --> 15:40.470
From the letting agents,
they're not going ahead

15:40.480 --> 15:42.392
with the cottage.

15:42.400 --> 15:45.063
It says it's too much work
to be done to be let-able.

15:45.080 --> 15:48.699
So I want to give you that cottage now

15:48.720 --> 15:51.190
rather than you have it later.

15:53.320 --> 15:56.552
It's good for a man to have a project.

15:56.560 --> 15:59.622
And it could get you out of the city.

16:05.400 --> 16:06.400
God, wow.

16:07.200 --> 16:08.200
Thank you.

16:09.720 --> 16:10.720
Thank you.

16:12.240 --> 16:13.469
Well, come on.

16:13.480 --> 16:14.320
There you go.

16:14.321 --> 16:17.155
Eat while it's still warm, please.

16:23.720 --> 16:25.074
You're a good boy, Merlin.

16:25.080 --> 16:26.628
All right, bye bye.

16:45.640 --> 16:47.188
Hi, Steve?

16:47.200 --> 16:49.112
Yes, yes, it is.

16:49.120 --> 16:52.660
Look, this is really
unprofessional, but...

17:38.160 --> 17:41.267
So they never actually
put central heating in

17:41.280 --> 17:42.908
which is amazing.

17:42.920 --> 17:47.063
There's a proper hole in
one of the bedroom floors.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.992
I should probably just sell it as is.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.310
No, no, no. It's brilliant.

17:52.320 --> 17:54.676
You just have to dig past all the crap.

17:54.680 --> 17:55.909
You can't sell.

17:56.800 --> 17:58.553
You're not seeing it. It... Oh..!

18:01.960 --> 18:02.960
So, um...

18:03.640 --> 18:06.349
was it like your parents'
weekend cottage or...

18:06.360 --> 18:08.386
No, we never came here.

18:08.400 --> 18:11.234
Perhaps Flora did
before she let it, but I...

18:11.240 --> 18:12.868
I really don't know.

18:14.800 --> 18:16.473
Who's Flora?

18:16.480 --> 18:17.834
My grandmother.

18:17.840 --> 18:20.344
Christ, that's depressing junk.

18:23.040 --> 18:25.225
Oh, but that's nice.

18:25.240 --> 18:26.240
You see?

18:29.200 --> 18:33.343
I'd really, really like to
do a job like this, Adam.

18:34.240 --> 18:37.108
It's like working on a
site with my brothers

18:37.120 --> 18:38.952
when I was growing up.

18:40.840 --> 18:41.910
All hands on.

18:44.320 --> 18:47.074
I'm bored of tarting up kitchens.

18:47.080 --> 18:50.790
What would Caspar think of
you working outside London?

18:50.800 --> 18:54.192
Well, we're not joined
at the hip, and, ah...

18:56.800 --> 19:00.066
and he's in Brighton with his
latest squeeze.

19:00.080 --> 19:02.789
- Oh. Really?
- Yeah.

19:03.760 --> 19:05.160
You don't mind?

19:06.120 --> 19:07.634
I don't own him.

19:19.840 --> 19:20.840
What?

19:23.640 --> 19:25.712
Do you mind kissing me?

20:01.880 --> 20:04.509
Ah. Am I, um...

20:07.000 --> 20:08.354
Am I barking up the wrong tree?

20:08.360 --> 20:09.360
No.

20:14.760 --> 20:15.760
Oh...

20:18.080 --> 20:19.230
What?

20:19.240 --> 20:20.993
It's not a porn film.

20:25.200 --> 20:28.341
There's a person in these jeans, okay?

20:56.520 --> 20:58.148
I can't.

20:58.200 --> 20:59.634
This is...

20:59.640 --> 21:01.074
I'm sorry.

21:12.560 --> 21:13.630
Sorry, did I misread...

21:13.640 --> 21:16.076
You saw the place, it's such a lot of work.

21:16.080 --> 21:17.080
Oh.

21:18.040 --> 21:19.040
Okay.

21:21.960 --> 21:23.554
I'll make my own way from here.

21:23.560 --> 21:24.560
Really?

21:26.080 --> 21:27.080
Yeah.

21:28.080 --> 21:30.584
I'll pay for your time.

21:30.600 --> 21:31.795
Whatever.

21:31.800 --> 21:32.800
I'll wait.

21:58.320 --> 21:59.799
Adam.

21:59.800 --> 22:00.950
How did it go?

22:02.240 --> 22:04.425
You were late back.

22:04.440 --> 22:08.059
I took a designer friend
with me for a second opinion.

22:08.080 --> 22:09.708
He likes it, but I...

22:10.800 --> 22:14.419
So it's your instinct, what, to sell?

22:14.440 --> 22:16.750
- Probably.
- Oh. That's a shame.

22:17.600 --> 22:18.480
I better get on.

22:18.481 --> 22:20.917
Perhaps we could... Oh.

22:49.320 --> 22:50.948
All right, thanks.

22:56.480 --> 22:59.872
I know you want to sell,
but I couldn't stop thinking

22:59.880 --> 23:02.316
of all you could do there.

23:02.320 --> 23:04.471
Can I show you?
- Not here.

23:05.400 --> 23:08.462
We have a backlog from this morning.

23:08.800 --> 23:10.473
I finish at five. Um...

23:11.240 --> 23:13.824
There's a cafe down the street.

23:17.400 --> 23:20.632
Will you please get Eddie's profile?

23:37.800 --> 23:38.870
Ah.

23:39.640 --> 23:41.916
I wasn't sure you'd come.

23:43.920 --> 23:46.504
I owe you an apology for the weekend.

23:46.520 --> 23:50.708
It doesn't matter, it was my fault, I...

23:50.720 --> 23:53.782
Anyway, do what you like with this.

23:53.800 --> 23:55.712
It may even help you sell
it if you can get someone

23:55.720 --> 23:58.748
to see past the hideous
wallpaper, I'm talking too much.

23:58.760 --> 23:59.760
Sorry.

24:00.640 --> 24:01.710
I'll shut up.

24:09.480 --> 24:12.189
These are beautiful, seriously.

24:14.760 --> 24:15.760
Thank you.

24:20.480 --> 24:23.109
I was a prat on Sunday.

24:24.360 --> 24:25.840
I'm not used to...

24:28.200 --> 24:29.200
You know.

24:30.880 --> 24:32.633
No
But...

24:40.320 --> 24:41.914
Thanks for doing these.

24:41.920 --> 24:44.902
I don't know what I want
to do with the cottage,

24:44.920 --> 24:47.230
but I should pay you.

24:47.240 --> 24:48.390
That's fine.

24:49.680 --> 24:52.434
They're a present, call me and...

24:54.040 --> 24:57.022
If you change your mind or whatever.

25:17.080 --> 25:18.708
Coffee.

25:18.720 --> 25:19.720
Thanks.

25:30.760 --> 25:33.423
I saw Adam Berryman again today.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.584
I want to do that cottage, Caspar.

25:38.600 --> 25:40.876
What about Hugo's new place?

25:40.880 --> 25:43.794
Hugo needs therapy, not new taps.

25:45.760 --> 25:48.788
It'd be a great opportunity for me.

25:48.800 --> 25:50.712
But, countryside.

25:50.720 --> 25:51.949
Country people.

25:57.760 --> 26:01.345
You're probably
right to sell it.

26:04.400 --> 26:05.400
Gin.

26:07.160 --> 26:08.276
Gin again.

26:14.160 --> 26:15.788
Who did you go with?

26:18.080 --> 26:20.550
A friend I met through work.

26:21.800 --> 26:22.800
Steve.

27:10.000 --> 27:11.150
Hi.
- Hey, boss.

27:12.840 --> 27:15.549
- Someone's happy.
- Like you wouldn't believe.

27:15.560 --> 27:18.064
I'm not redesigning
another high-end kitchen.

27:18.080 --> 27:19.878
I'm in heaven.

27:19.880 --> 27:20.880
So.

27:23.360 --> 27:24.360
You skiving?

27:27.120 --> 27:28.696
Saturday's surgery's only short

27:28.697 --> 27:30.273
and they owe me so much leave.

27:30.280 --> 27:31.280
Good.

27:35.680 --> 27:36.680
Mr Popular.

27:38.360 --> 27:39.360
Trust me.

27:40.400 --> 27:43.826
Living with Caspar, you
could write a thesis

27:43.840 --> 27:45.274
on sex addiction.

27:47.200 --> 27:50.114
So, was your dad tough on you?

27:52.160 --> 27:54.516
Let's just say his model of masculinity

27:54.520 --> 27:57.308
wasn't exactly Lord Bernard.

27:57.320 --> 27:59.027
You've no idea who that is, do you?

27:59.040 --> 28:01.544
No.

28:01.560 --> 28:03.791
Just tell me
that you can't explain

28:03.800 --> 28:05.473
the offside rule.

28:05.480 --> 28:07.438
If you're closer to
your opponent's goal line

28:07.440 --> 28:08.715
than both the ball and...

28:08.720 --> 28:10.268
I so had you there.

28:12.000 --> 28:14.663
Bitch.

28:14.680 --> 28:16.512
If beds could talk, eh?

28:16.520 --> 28:19.627
I'm sure this had a quiet a blameless life.

28:35.360 --> 28:37.033
It's getting late.

28:38.400 --> 28:39.400
I should go.

28:42.520 --> 28:45.661
I got a lot more done with you here, so...

28:47.480 --> 28:50.314
It's only Sunday tomorrow.

28:50.320 --> 28:52.870
What, you have a hot date?
- No.

28:54.560 --> 28:58.384
That old sofa folds
out into a bed of sorts.

29:08.400 --> 29:11.906
This is so good, what did you...

29:11.920 --> 29:13.752
Pepper, salt, lemon.

29:15.400 --> 29:16.720
It's just steak.

29:18.160 --> 29:19.754
Do you both cook?

29:23.000 --> 29:24.150
What?

29:24.160 --> 29:25.160
Sorry.

29:25.600 --> 29:26.600
Um...

29:26.680 --> 29:29.946
Yes, we both enjoy cooking
when we're in, thanks.

29:29.960 --> 29:32.236
We got out a lot.

29:34.640 --> 29:37.224
Do you mind me
asking all these questions?

29:37.240 --> 29:38.469
I don't get a chance to...

29:38.480 --> 29:40.870
Stick around long enough
to make conversation?

29:40.880 --> 29:42.872
I'm sorry, that was mean.

29:45.880 --> 29:48.543
You're not even out, aren't you?

29:49.680 --> 29:52.468
I bet you've still not told your granny.

29:52.480 --> 29:54.472
Flora's so not a granny.

29:59.040 --> 30:01.624
Not in so many words, she's...

30:01.640 --> 30:04.349
she's never invited confidences.

30:07.280 --> 30:09.636
And you're scared she'd...

30:12.240 --> 30:15.028
I, um... I don't know.

30:17.640 --> 30:18.710
Is that rain?

30:21.240 --> 30:22.240
No.

30:31.560 --> 30:32.789
This is nice.

30:35.600 --> 30:37.148
Yeah.

31:24.880 --> 31:26.575
- Steve.
- Yeah?

31:26.576 --> 31:28.272
It's a picture.

31:28.720 --> 31:29.995
Here.
- No. Erm...

31:31.240 --> 31:33.869
You have grease on your hands.

31:33.880 --> 31:35.314
Better off just blowing it.

31:35.320 --> 31:36.656
Close your eyes.

31:36.657 --> 31:37.994
One, two, three.

31:43.440 --> 31:44.510
Wow.

31:51.200 --> 31:54.114
- Adam, can I come in?
- Mm, come in.

32:10.400 --> 32:12.028
Now, um...

32:12.640 --> 32:17.136
No, you're going to spoil your
appetite if you eat all those.

32:17.160 --> 32:22.100
I've been working so hard
all weekend, I'm starving.

32:22.120 --> 32:25.546
Steve has a real vision for how he can...

32:27.120 --> 32:29.510
Now doesn't he have a life in London?

32:29.520 --> 32:31.876
No, well, it's complicated.

32:31.880 --> 32:33.030
He has Caspar.

32:34.880 --> 32:38.943
An art dealer and what
Steve calls semi-detached.

32:40.480 --> 32:41.480
Tuh!

32:41.800 --> 32:44.509
Hmm! I have to show you this.

32:44.520 --> 32:46.671
We found it in a cupboard.

32:47.720 --> 32:50.076
I thought it was really rather lovely.

32:50.080 --> 32:51.628
It might've been...

32:57.800 --> 32:59.598
I don't remember that.

32:59.600 --> 33:01.876
Must've belonged to the Brewers.

33:01.880 --> 33:05.192
It's addressed to you and Grandpa.

33:05.200 --> 33:07.863
To Flora and Michael
in the hope the enclosed

33:07.880 --> 33:12.228
might one day hang in
your drawing room. Thomas.

33:12.240 --> 33:13.674
Who's Thomas?

33:13.680 --> 33:17.265
Oh, he was a friend
of your grandfather's.

33:20.640 --> 33:22.632
But we didn't like the picture

33:22.640 --> 33:26.544
and, um, we put it away, chucked it out.

33:38.880 --> 33:42.021
Why did you just pretend that you...

33:44.800 --> 33:46.120
I can forgive.

33:49.640 --> 33:53.783
It's how you're made.
I wish you would be discreet.

33:54.960 --> 33:58.147
But, of course, that's my age.
- What..?

33:59.160 --> 34:00.867
You and the man.

34:00.880 --> 34:03.509
There's nothing
between... There's nothing.

34:03.520 --> 34:06.980
Well, I never expected
when I gave you the cottage,

34:07.000 --> 34:08.438
that you'd turn it into somewhere

34:08.440 --> 34:09.880
that you'd bring your latest...

34:09.880 --> 34:11.956
- Stop.
- ...pick up.

34:11.958 --> 34:14.034
Just stop right there.

34:14.040 --> 34:17.101
- Using your father's money.
- Just stop.

34:17.120 --> 34:21.536
I'm 34 years old and I'm
still hiding in your basement.

34:21.560 --> 34:23.154
Is it any wonder...

34:26.560 --> 34:29.746
It's no business of yours who I fuck.

34:29.760 --> 34:31.467
I don't need to hear this.

34:31.480 --> 34:32.708
I'm sorry, silly of me to forget

34:32.719 --> 34:36.385
that anything below the neck disgusts you.

34:36.400 --> 34:39.154
Do you ever lose control?

34:39.159 --> 34:40.080
What do you mean?

34:40.081 --> 34:42.869
Did you ever feel the
need to give yourself?

34:42.880 --> 34:44.906
I loved your grandfather!

34:44.920 --> 34:46.992
- Yes, but passion!
- Yes!

34:48.159 --> 34:49.159
I loved him!

34:51.080 --> 34:52.150
With passion!

34:54.960 --> 34:55.960
Shit.

35:00.240 --> 35:01.788
All right, you win.

35:04.560 --> 35:07.986
I've been ashamed all my life.

35:08.640 --> 35:09.994
And I wondered why that was.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.470
Yes, you should be ashamed
because it is terrible,

35:12.480 --> 35:15.621
it's disgusting to live with other people

35:15.640 --> 35:17.552
as if you were animals.

35:18.960 --> 35:20.872
- Animals?
- Yes!

35:21.680 --> 35:23.228
Animals!

35:31.640 --> 35:35.624
I always feel as if I'm in the wrong.
It's not fair.

35:47.920 --> 35:50.310
Come on, Steve, come on.

35:50.320 --> 35:51.993
The person you are calling
is not available...

35:52.000 --> 35:52.920
Shit!

35:58.760 --> 35:59.760
Fuck.

36:21.280 --> 36:22.396
Have you got somewhere we can go

36:22.400 --> 36:24.358
that isn't halfway to Gatwick?

36:24.360 --> 36:25.476
- Yeah.
- Good.

36:25.480 --> 36:28.234
You wanna have a drink?

36:32.360 --> 36:35.547
Watch where you're going.

36:35.560 --> 36:38.792
If that was you, here I am, let's go.

36:40.760 --> 36:42.194
No, mate.

36:42.200 --> 36:44.784
Well, what are you waitin' for?

36:44.920 --> 36:45.990
Fuck off.

36:57.840 --> 36:59.160
You want some?

37:06.840 --> 37:08.798
Oh yeah, that's right, take it.

38:19.680 --> 38:22.264
I'm sorry, I didn't
know where else to go.

38:22.280 --> 38:25.114
I just... just for a... the night.

38:25.480 --> 38:26.320
I'm sorry.

38:26.321 --> 38:27.915
It's your place.

38:27.920 --> 38:29.319
Oh, God, I stink.

38:29.320 --> 38:30.719
I need a shower.

38:30.720 --> 38:32.632
I left a message at work.

38:32.640 --> 38:35.474
I've taken tomorrow off.
I'm sorry for waking you.

38:35.480 --> 38:38.542
Even the shower's not working,
the plumber comes tomorrow.

38:38.560 --> 38:40.745
The sink is fine, just go to bed.

38:40.760 --> 38:42.354
- Are you...
- Go to bed.

39:42.760 --> 39:43.760
It's okay.

39:45.040 --> 39:46.360
It's not okay.

39:47.960 --> 39:50.066
It will be okay.

39:58.200 --> 39:59.200
Here.

40:07.520 --> 40:08.590
Oh...

40:15.720 --> 40:17.632
Don't you want to talk?

40:23.040 --> 40:25.794
I wouldn't know where to start.

41:23.000 --> 41:24.878
- I'm sorry.
- Shh, shh.

41:26.840 --> 41:28.832
I don't think I can...

41:32.240 --> 41:34.118
Could you just hold me?

41:36.000 --> 41:37.150
Until I sleep?

41:40.720 --> 41:41.720
Sure.

41:45.640 --> 41:46.640
Sure.

42:44.680 --> 42:45.680
Ha.

42:58.640 --> 43:01.076
So what happens now?

43:03.880 --> 43:04.880
I want you,

43:08.080 --> 43:10.152
but I'm going to have to tell him.

43:10.160 --> 43:13.472
I don't do casual. I can't do app sex.

43:15.640 --> 43:16.640
I need more.

43:36.640 --> 43:37.640
Okay.

43:38.960 --> 43:39.960
No, really.

43:42.480 --> 43:43.960
I can't share you.

43:56.400 --> 43:57.720
Look, deleted.

44:16.960 --> 44:19.270
Is this gonna feel weird
with me paying you?

44:19.280 --> 44:21.784
No, you're just humping the help.

44:21.880 --> 44:25.021
- Yeah.
- I will tell you when it gets weird.

44:25.040 --> 44:26.040
Yeah?

44:40.000 --> 44:42.072
The trouble with open relationships

44:42.080 --> 44:45.904
is they don't end with a
satisfying plate-smashing row.

44:45.920 --> 44:50.063
They just become about
coffee beans and cat litter.

44:54.880 --> 44:55.880
Yeah.

45:01.000 --> 45:03.026
He's so inexperienced.

45:03.040 --> 45:04.588
Is that what
they call him nowadays?

45:04.600 --> 45:06.398
You know what I mean.

45:10.120 --> 45:12.670
Just promise me you don't think

45:12.680 --> 45:15.150
you can save him from himself.

45:18.880 --> 45:20.109
You saved me.

45:21.800 --> 45:25.943
You just needed pointing
in the right direction.

45:31.560 --> 45:34.030
Oh, it was a lovely send off.

45:34.040 --> 45:38.103
Perfect music, and readings
by all the grandchildren.

45:40.480 --> 45:43.143
But we all knew that
relations had broken down

45:43.160 --> 45:46.472
between her and their parents years ago.

45:49.000 --> 45:52.141
You're lucky Adam's so close.

45:52.160 --> 45:54.630
Yes, I am, aren't I?

46:01.000 --> 46:02.000
Flora?

46:03.080 --> 46:04.080
Oh, sorry.

46:05.280 --> 46:07.636
Miles away, where are we?

46:07.640 --> 46:11.828
Agnes passed, I aimed heart
and Geraldine said two clubs.

46:17.800 --> 46:19.872
Are you quite well, dear?

46:30.920 --> 46:31.920
Thank you.

46:57.480 --> 46:59.711
Oh...

47:10.240 --> 47:12.790
Look I just wanna say I am so happy

47:12.800 --> 47:15.304
that you were all able
to help us celebrate

47:15.320 --> 47:17.949
finally getting sewage mains.

47:19.840 --> 47:21.798
But seriously.

47:21.800 --> 47:25.943
It's good to meet Adam's
surprisingly wholesome friends.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.356
- Ooh.
- And, uh, I just...

47:28.360 --> 47:30.796
You didn't tell me
you were inviting Flora.

47:30.800 --> 47:31.870
Flora!

47:31.880 --> 47:32.880
Hi!

47:35.840 --> 47:36.840
Hello.

47:45.480 --> 47:47.790
I'm sorry, I should've rung.

47:48.680 --> 47:50.080
Don't be silly.

47:52.440 --> 47:54.193
It's good to see you.

47:57.400 --> 47:58.400
Yes.

47:58.640 --> 48:01.303
I came to bring you this.

48:03.520 --> 48:06.024
Well, it belongs here, with you.

48:16.880 --> 48:17.880
Thank you.

48:22.800 --> 48:24.473
Come and meet Steve.

48:29.800 --> 48:32.714
They're so
sweet when they're new.

48:32.720 --> 48:35.702
When they're sleeping or
they've just been fed, yeah.

48:40.960 --> 48:43.360
Steve's a honey.

48:44.760 --> 48:48.470
You must be really glad that
Adam's finally met someone.

48:48.480 --> 48:49.630
He's very...

48:52.400 --> 48:54.472
I'm trying to adjust, Claudie,

48:54.520 --> 48:57.912
I can't turn overnight into a liberal.

48:57.920 --> 49:00.196
This is rather good, you know?

49:00.200 --> 49:02.078
March has become very collectible.

49:02.080 --> 49:03.080
Ah, I see.

49:05.840 --> 49:09.983
I wish I hadn't told Michael
to throw away his painting.

49:10.880 --> 49:12.906
How well did you know Thomas March.

49:12.920 --> 49:14.878
Not at all well.

49:14.880 --> 49:18.624
They were at school
together and in the army.

49:19.600 --> 49:21.956
To Flora and Michael,
in the hope that one day

49:21.960 --> 49:24.908
the enclosed might hang
in your drawing room.

49:24.920 --> 49:26.718
What was enclosed with it?

49:26.720 --> 49:30.032
Oh, Thomas was probably drunk.

49:30.040 --> 49:32.476
He must've meant the painting.

49:32.480 --> 49:33.516
Can I have some wine?

49:33.520 --> 49:34.749
Yes, of course.

49:34.760 --> 49:37.196
Would you mind, I think
there's something peculiar

49:37.200 --> 49:38.748
about the frame.

49:38.760 --> 49:41.196
Something odd going on.

49:41.200 --> 49:42.714
It's just a hunch.

49:43.800 --> 49:45.872
Oh, my goodness.

49:56.520 --> 50:00.708
Yeah, there's definitely a
second painting under there.

50:10.680 --> 50:12.752
It's grandpa, isn't it?

50:18.560 --> 50:21.314
Hey. It's okay.

50:36.320 --> 50:37.320
Here.

50:47.400 --> 50:49.073
I thought I'd won.

50:52.520 --> 50:53.520
Won what?

50:54.400 --> 50:55.400
His love.

50:58.240 --> 51:00.676
But Thomas March loved Michael

51:00.680 --> 51:03.230
and Michael loved Thomas March.

51:06.880 --> 51:08.986
Grandpa was gay.

51:09.000 --> 51:10.000
Yes.

51:12.640 --> 51:13.994
Grandpa was gay.

51:19.000 --> 51:24.896
He loved me, but he married
me to be like everybody else.

51:26.400 --> 51:28.107
How did you find out?

51:28.120 --> 51:32.946
His love letters. They were beautiful,
and I burned them.

51:35.880 --> 51:37.360
You burned them?

51:38.920 --> 51:41.868
I was angry and scared that Michael

51:41.880 --> 51:43.872
would be sent to prison.

51:43.880 --> 51:44.880
Thomas was.

51:47.920 --> 51:49.400
I thought I'd won.

52:04.000 --> 52:07.028
I ruined both of their lives.

52:11.320 --> 52:12.914
They hurt you, too.

52:19.040 --> 52:20.838
Yes.

52:34.480 --> 52:36.233
I wish I'd known him.

52:50.960 --> 52:51.960
Thank you.

53:02.560 --> 53:04.632
Could you ever imagine...

53:08.160 --> 53:09.160
What?

53:12.200 --> 53:14.032
...having kids with me?

53:16.920 --> 53:18.548
I certainly could.

53:23.280 --> 53:25.750
I got so broody today
with those twins around.

53:25.760 --> 53:26.760
Me too.

53:31.800 --> 53:34.714
Thanks for making today so special.

53:35.880 --> 53:39.306
Teamwork.

53:43.960 --> 53:45.474
I'm so sorry.

53:45.480 --> 53:46.834
It's just I...

53:46.840 --> 53:48.752
Wished you had left it on silent.

53:48.760 --> 53:49.876
I did delete it.

53:49.880 --> 53:52.350
Yeah, but then you put it...

53:53.680 --> 53:55.512
Steve, it's a habit.

53:57.200 --> 53:58.873
I didn't... I haven't.

54:00.840 --> 54:02.194
Okay.

54:02.200 --> 54:04.158
Steve, Steve.

54:04.160 --> 54:06.311
Hey, Steve, come on. Steve?

54:14.400 --> 54:15.400
Shit!

54:18.200 --> 54:19.200
Shit!

54:40.040 --> 54:42.874
My God, are you all right?

54:42.880 --> 54:44.234
What's happened?

54:45.080 --> 54:47.311
What's happened, are you hurt?

54:47.320 --> 54:51.144
Come on.

54:51.160 --> 54:52.120
Come on, now,

54:52.121 --> 54:53.715
now let's sit down.

54:55.160 --> 54:56.639
Here we go.

54:56.640 --> 54:58.552
Here we go.
- I'm sorry.

54:59.320 --> 55:01.710
He left me.
- Oh..!

55:02.360 --> 55:04.511
It's all my fault.

55:04.520 --> 55:06.478
It's all my fucking fault.

55:06.480 --> 55:08.870
Weren't you happy together?

55:08.880 --> 55:12.021
I've never been so happy in my life.

55:12.480 --> 55:16.543
Well, you must go after him,
you can't lose him.

55:18.040 --> 55:19.439
I'm sorry for waking you.

55:19.440 --> 55:22.422
No, I'm glad you came to me.

55:22.440 --> 55:25.069
I just thought of something.

55:25.080 --> 55:28.540
I thought of something.
I'd forgotten all about it

55:28.560 --> 55:30.632
until I saw the painting.

55:31.360 --> 55:32.360
Um...

55:33.760 --> 55:34.760
Here.

55:35.680 --> 55:38.708
When I thought I was losing Michael...

55:38.720 --> 55:43.694
Oh, I fought like a
tigress, to get him back.

55:43.760 --> 55:46.310
I was all ferocity!

55:46.560 --> 55:48.188
Oh, there was...

55:48.600 --> 55:50.398
There was no pride.

55:51.840 --> 55:52.680
Now,

55:52.681 --> 55:55.343
this is a letter your
Grandfather Michael wrote,

55:55.360 --> 55:56.839
he never sent it.

55:56.840 --> 55:59.196
I found it after he died.

55:59.200 --> 56:02.307
Oh, you'll see.
I want you to keep it.

56:02.320 --> 56:05.860
Keep everything. And you know
whatever happens,

56:05.880 --> 56:09.465
I know that your Grandfather Michael
and Thomas

56:09.480 --> 56:12.621
would've been very, very proud of you.

56:17.560 --> 56:18.630
Oh.

56:23.040 --> 56:24.110
Well done.

56:27.320 --> 56:28.320
Thank you.

57:05.560 --> 57:07.711
My darling Thomas.

57:07.760 --> 57:08.910
I'm at work.

57:10.360 --> 57:13.422
Nobody knows I'm writing to you here.

57:14.400 --> 57:19.624
You refuse my visits, so you're probably
tearing up my letters, too.

57:20.920 --> 57:24.346
But there's nothing else
I can do but keep trying.

57:24.360 --> 57:27.274
It's beyond my control, do you see?

57:28.560 --> 57:32.862
All those months ago when I
had nothing to lose really,

57:32.880 --> 57:35.190
I wrote to you in my
head but was too cowardly

57:35.200 --> 57:37.784
to set more than lies on paper.

57:38.880 --> 57:41.543
And now I find I no longer care.

57:43.920 --> 57:46.196
The love I feel for you runs through me

57:46.200 --> 57:48.192
like grain through wood.

57:50.160 --> 57:51.754
I love you, Thomas.

57:56.480 --> 57:59.314
Your face, your voice,
your touch enter my mind

57:59.320 --> 58:02.154
at the least opportune moments.

58:02.160 --> 58:05.392
And I find I have no
power to withstand them.

58:05.640 --> 58:07.268
No desire to.

58:10.280 --> 58:13.592
I want us to be together
as we were in the cottage,

58:13.600 --> 58:16.992
only forever, not just a weekend.

58:21.160 --> 58:25.144
I want it to go on so
long that it feels normal.

58:26.480 --> 58:28.790
I think of you constantly.

58:28.800 --> 58:32.385
Your face, your breath
on my neck at night.

58:34.160 --> 58:37.620
I want to do all the
ordinary, unbedroomy things

58:37.640 --> 58:40.474
we never got around to doing.

58:40.480 --> 58:41.550
Making toast,

58:42.400 --> 58:43.595
raking leaves,

58:44.680 --> 58:46.228
sitting in silence.

58:50.160 --> 58:51.708
I love you, Thomas.

58:54.160 --> 58:56.550
I've always loved you.

58:56.560 --> 58:57.835
I see that now.

59:00.240 --> 59:02.312
Tell me I'm not too late.
