00:18.677 --> 00:20.176
SELINA: <i>My fellow Americans,</i>

00:20.312 --> 00:24.598
<i>I stand before you this
morning in barefaced awe</i>

00:24.683 --> 00:28.101
<i>of the majesty of our democratic system.</i>

00:28.186 --> 00:29.936
<i>What a night.</i>

00:30.022 --> 00:32.022
<i>In a democracy such as ours,</i>

00:32.107 --> 00:35.025
it falls to the people to
choose their president,

00:35.160 --> 00:37.661
and that is what you
attempted to do last night.

00:37.746 --> 00:41.531
<i>As it turned out, there's a
virtually unprecedented tie</i>

00:41.667 --> 00:42.999
<i>in the electoral college,</i>

00:43.085 --> 00:44.751
<i>a somewhat arcane institution</i>

00:44.870 --> 00:47.370
<i>that many scholars believe
we should do away with.</i>

00:47.506 --> 00:49.873
<i>I wish to say on a personal note</i>

00:50.008 --> 00:51.841
<i>that although there is a tie,</i>

00:51.927 --> 00:55.378
<i>I am most privileged to
have won the popular vote.</i>

00:55.464 --> 00:57.881
<i>And though this tie may be frustrating,</i>

00:57.966 --> 01:00.216
<i>I want to assure the American people</i>

01:00.302 --> 01:02.385
our country is not leaderless.

01:02.521 --> 01:05.939
No matter who you voted
for, I am your president.

01:06.058 --> 01:08.441
Thank you all. God bless you.

01:08.560 --> 01:12.612
And may God bless the
United States of America.

01:12.731 --> 01:14.614
We're clear.

01:14.733 --> 01:17.567
Can we have the room?
Fantastic speech, ma'am.

01:17.653 --> 01:20.153
The three Ss... strength,
stability and bullshit.

01:20.238 --> 01:23.740
I forgot to thank the voters for making our
country look like a high school Spanish club.

01:23.875 --> 01:26.910
Didn't those founding fuckers
ever hear of an odd number?

01:26.995 --> 01:29.412
Two great Greek
contributions to society...

01:29.498 --> 01:31.748
democracy and getting fucked up the ass.

01:31.833 --> 01:34.968
I've tried both and they're
way overrated, like jazz.

01:35.087 --> 01:38.305
My bowling coach used to say a tie
was like kissing your sister.

01:38.423 --> 01:41.141
Well, this feels like my sister
took a shit on my chest.

01:41.259 --> 01:43.810
God, I'll tell you something, too, okay?

01:43.929 --> 01:46.763
There is no world in which I
am going to be vice president

01:46.898 --> 01:50.934
to that smug, Dick Van Dyke-looking
motherfucker Tom James.

01:51.069 --> 01:52.736
Who in the hell does he think...

01:52.821 --> 01:55.021
Catherine, what are you
doing with that thing?

01:55.107 --> 01:57.490
- BEN: <i> Is that on?</i>
- Remember when we got back last night?

01:57.609 --> 01:59.109
My thesis film about the tie.

01:59.244 --> 02:00.527
She majored in film at Vassar College.

02:00.612 --> 02:02.362
Oh, believe me, I know
what she majored in.

02:02.447 --> 02:04.698
65 grand a year to watch movies.

02:04.783 --> 02:06.700
Mom, this is such a historic event.

02:06.785 --> 02:08.535
Can you please just get off of me?

02:08.620 --> 02:10.620
And I never came up with a
thesis my advisor liked

02:10.705 --> 02:13.340
because I had that thing last semester
where I was tired all the time...

02:13.458 --> 02:16.509
Okay, we don't have time to hear
the story of your syndrome.

02:16.628 --> 02:18.294
What about your minor, dance?

02:18.380 --> 02:21.765
Why don't you make up a little kind
of a dance about the election?

02:21.850 --> 02:24.517
You know, you can't decide should
you dance or should you not dance?

02:24.636 --> 02:27.771
I want you to take this seriously.
You promised me.

02:27.856 --> 02:30.190
Please, Catherine, stop with
the whining, all right?

02:30.308 --> 02:32.942
You're gonna shatter the
bulletproof glass in here.

02:33.028 --> 02:34.861
How is it that we did not win Delaware?

02:34.980 --> 02:37.897
Okay, is that a yes to my question?

02:39.651 --> 02:43.119
Okay, she can have full access, okay?

02:43.205 --> 02:46.740
Starting right after we address
the situation in Yemen.

02:46.825 --> 02:48.408
Honey, it's Yemen.

02:48.493 --> 02:51.661
Life gives you Yemen, you
got to make Yemenade.

02:51.747 --> 02:53.797
Okay, well, I'll come back later.

02:53.882 --> 02:55.999
You always do. (KISSES)

02:56.084 --> 02:57.333
- <i> (DOOR CLOSES)</i>
- Ma'am.

02:57.419 --> 02:58.835
No, there's not gonna be a film.

02:58.920 --> 03:00.804
The only thing Catherine ever finished

03:00.889 --> 03:02.338
was an entire ice cream cake.

03:02.424 --> 03:03.840
Quick thinking about Yemen, by the way.

03:03.925 --> 03:06.393
Actually, four Christian
missionaries burned to death.

03:06.511 --> 03:07.427
Oh, even better.

03:07.512 --> 03:09.813
Amy! Jesus.

03:09.898 --> 03:12.432
This thing on the side of my
face feels like a dog nipple.

03:12.517 --> 03:13.900
It's hardly noticeable, ma'am,

03:14.019 --> 03:15.819
like our Hispanic voter turnout.

03:15.904 --> 03:18.354
Maybe you just might want to
see a doctor just in case.

03:18.440 --> 03:20.740
No, she doesn't need a doctor.
I got it under control.

03:20.859 --> 03:22.192
- Amy!
- Yeah?

03:22.327 --> 03:23.993
- So, what?
- Nothing.

03:24.079 --> 03:26.196
I've been on the phone all
night with these clueless

03:26.281 --> 03:28.114
constitutional law experts of ours.

03:28.200 --> 03:29.866
I don't know what's getting
their dicks harder,

03:29.951 --> 03:31.835
an electoral college tie
or talking to a girl.

03:31.920 --> 03:35.538
- Are you back?
- No, I'm not back. I'm just helping out.

03:35.624 --> 03:36.790
- Ma'am.
- What?

03:36.875 --> 03:39.175
Do you want to see a doctor about the...

03:39.261 --> 03:41.344
- It's a stress pimple.
- No, it's...

03:41.430 --> 03:43.763
- I get them on my ass all the time.
- It's not a stress pimple.

03:43.882 --> 03:46.683
It's a pimple that erupted
during a very stressful time.

03:46.768 --> 03:48.351
- Gary's on it, okay?
- Exactly, yes.

03:48.437 --> 03:50.437
- I don't have a spoon.
- Oh.

03:50.555 --> 03:52.055
Have you tried cider vinegar?

03:52.190 --> 03:54.023
No, we're using hot compresses.
That's all we need.

03:54.109 --> 03:57.143
For the stress pimple? Ben gets those
on his butt. She should see a doctor.

03:57.229 --> 03:58.945
- Amy's back.
- No, I'm not back.

03:59.064 --> 04:01.231
- Ma'am, rave reviews on the speech.
- Good.

04:01.316 --> 04:03.900
- Oh, and big news.
- Oh, God, O'Brien made a statement?

04:04.035 --> 04:06.870
I'm sorry, I should have
said big personal news.

04:06.955 --> 04:09.122
Wendy and I are adopting
a baby from China.

04:09.241 --> 04:09.879
GARY: Oh!

04:09.904 --> 04:11.815
We were keeping it a secret
till after the election.

04:11.910 --> 04:14.077
Actually, Wendy was keeping it
a secret from me until today

04:14.212 --> 04:15.745
because I'm so bad with keeping secrets.

04:15.831 --> 04:18.714
- But I'm gonna be a dad.
- You're a nincompoop.

04:18.800 --> 04:21.918
We are in the middle of a tied election.

04:22.053 --> 04:25.338
There is no time for some Chinese baby.

04:25.423 --> 04:27.423
Cancel it and see if you
can get your money back.

04:27.559 --> 04:30.260
Fortune cookie say you fuck
up big-time, round eye.

04:30.345 --> 04:33.313
It's not a big deal. I don't
even know when to expect her.

04:33.431 --> 04:36.099
And, starting today, I'm
getting in dad shape.

04:36.234 --> 04:36.893
Counting my steps.

04:36.918 --> 04:38.675
Too bad you're not
counting your missteps.

04:38.770 --> 04:40.153
You'd be done by breakfast, right?

04:40.272 --> 04:42.155
I prefer to count my steps in my head.

04:42.274 --> 04:44.190
4,383.

04:44.276 --> 04:46.159
Get out of my sight, Kent, okay?

04:46.278 --> 04:47.660
I have not forgiven you for this tie.

04:47.779 --> 04:50.446
Ma'am, I have the final House results.

04:52.284 --> 04:54.250
- Lafontaine won?
- Mm-hmm.

04:54.336 --> 04:56.169
How many abortions does a pro-lifer

04:56.288 --> 04:58.922
have to pressure his mistress into
before the people turn on him?

04:59.007 --> 05:01.291
- Three.
- And how did Craig lose?

05:01.426 --> 05:02.959
Didn't she go to Indiana,
like, five times?

05:03.094 --> 05:05.128
That may have been the problem.

05:05.213 --> 05:07.597
All right, listen. From
this moment forward,

05:07.682 --> 05:09.883
people, I am all about the House vote.

05:09.968 --> 05:13.770
We are recommending direct engagement
with individual congressmen.

05:13.855 --> 05:15.638
- That's got to happen.
- BEN: <i> That's right.</i>

05:15.724 --> 05:17.690
And every day you have to do the
one thing O'Brien can't do.

05:17.809 --> 05:20.643
- Yeah, drive sober.
- Take a shit without getting a hernia.

05:20.729 --> 05:23.146
Be the president. It is imperative

05:23.281 --> 05:25.281
that you look presidential right now.

05:25.367 --> 05:27.367
I'm going to visit troops,

05:27.485 --> 05:30.320
go on and off of Air Force
One as much as possible.

05:30.455 --> 05:32.121
- We don't even have to leave the ground.
- Right.

05:32.207 --> 05:33.990
Ma'am, you may want to consider

05:34.075 --> 05:36.376
- moving up that symposium on race.
- SELINA: <i> Uh...</i>

05:36.494 --> 05:39.712
I don't think that we're
symposium on race desperate yet.

05:39.831 --> 05:42.498
- All right?
- Hi.

05:42.634 --> 05:43.833
Sorry I'm late.

05:43.969 --> 05:46.135
Strangely, I agree with
everything Amy just said.

05:46.221 --> 05:48.254
And if I may also suggest

05:48.340 --> 05:50.807
<i>repurposing the election Twitter account</i>

05:50.892 --> 05:53.843
to a new POTUS account to talk
directly to the American people.

05:53.929 --> 05:57.430
Great idea, Bill. Could you...

05:57.515 --> 06:00.683
could you step outside
for a moment, please?

06:00.819 --> 06:02.602
- <i> (DOOR OPENS)</i>
- Sure.

06:03.855 --> 06:05.855
Now.

06:05.991 --> 06:08.107
- <i> (DOOR CLOSES)</i>
- There's only one person

06:08.193 --> 06:10.193
I'd be more surprised to see
today in the Roosevelt Room

06:10.328 --> 06:12.362
and that's Teddy fucking Roosevelt.

06:12.497 --> 06:14.614
- I'm just trying to help the president.
- And she appreciates that.

06:14.699 --> 06:18.034
But the US Attorney for the District
of Columbia is prepared to indict you.

06:18.119 --> 06:20.920
You're as welcome here as a
swastika-shaped shit in a synagogue.

06:21.039 --> 06:22.789
- Of course.
- I spoke with the president

06:22.874 --> 06:25.041
and she's willing to
reconsider a full pardon

06:25.176 --> 06:27.794
if you surrender quietly. No media.

06:27.879 --> 06:30.296
Just don't want to
dominate the news cycle.

06:30.382 --> 06:32.882
- Can I just say one thing?
- Yes, good-bye.

06:36.221 --> 06:38.721
- (DOOR OPENS)
- So, how'd it go?

06:38.857 --> 06:40.056
He took it like a man.

06:40.191 --> 06:42.725
Oh, well, he better get
used to that. Pfft.

06:42.861 --> 06:44.394
Isn't she adorable?

06:44.479 --> 06:46.863
- Oh, they all look alike to me.
- What?

06:46.948 --> 06:50.366
Not Chinese people, but
pictures of children. How old?

06:50.452 --> 06:53.903
The agency says she's either
16 months or three years old.

06:54.039 --> 06:55.705
- Do you like your Fitbit?
- Oh, yeah.

06:55.790 --> 06:58.741
- I am just over 12,000 steps today.
- (PHONE RINGING)

06:58.827 --> 07:00.994
I'm at 3,000. Did you run to work today?

07:01.079 --> 07:03.079
No, the job keeps me active.

07:03.214 --> 07:05.498
Office of the president.

07:06.584 --> 07:07.800
Hold, please.

07:07.919 --> 07:10.303
When we come back, the
pollster postmortem.

07:10.422 --> 07:13.089
Why were the exit polls so off?

07:16.311 --> 07:19.262
- Oh, Greg. Greg.
- Dan.

07:19.397 --> 07:20.930
- Great job last night.
- Thank you.

07:21.016 --> 07:22.649
I saw Matty Curtis crying
in the parking garage.

07:22.767 --> 07:24.567
(LAUGHS) That's fantastic. Hey, listen.

07:24.653 --> 07:26.569
I was really hoping to get back
on, but they got me waiting

07:26.655 --> 07:28.521
- in the greenroom for, like, two hours.
- Spauldy showed up.

07:28.606 --> 07:30.690
He's here. He's getting his hair done.
Just go home, I guess.

07:30.775 --> 07:32.325
But I killed it last night, right?

07:32.444 --> 07:34.444
Dan, look, I think you could
have a future in this,

07:34.529 --> 07:36.279
but you got to get out there
and make a name for yourself.

07:36.414 --> 07:38.948
You ran one campaign for two weeks
and had a nervous breakdown.

07:39.034 --> 07:40.450
That is medically inaccurate.

07:40.535 --> 07:42.201
Go out, win a race with a Jesus-loving

07:42.287 --> 07:44.754
homophobic homosexual or
a racist billionaire.

07:44.839 --> 07:46.789
Then we can talk about a career in TV.

07:51.129 --> 07:54.630
- How's Zitzilla looking?
- Angry. You been picking at it?

07:54.766 --> 07:56.716
No.

07:56.801 --> 08:00.019
Ahem, well, maybe a little bit, but...

08:00.138 --> 08:02.138
- Ow! Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God. What? What?

08:02.273 --> 08:05.224
- Oh, that is so hot.
- It's supposed to be hot.

08:05.310 --> 08:06.976
And the tea is cold.

08:07.112 --> 08:08.811
Madam President, Chinese hackers

08:08.947 --> 08:11.531
breached an NSA firewall
earlier this morning.

08:11.649 --> 08:13.616
- Any chance they fixed the Wi-Fi?
- I'll check.

08:13.702 --> 08:15.985
And the director of the Secret
Service is waiting to see you.

08:16.121 --> 08:18.738
Then send him in. If he's been
waiting to see me, I mean...

08:18.823 --> 08:20.656
- hi, Keith.
- Sorry to bother you, ma'am.

08:20.742 --> 08:22.742
<i>No, it's okay. It's no bother.</i>

08:22.827 --> 08:26.162
Since you became president, we have been
looking for a new lead agent for your detail.

08:26.247 --> 08:29.132
Gosh, I like Bob. I mean, apart
from the discolored tooth.

08:29.217 --> 08:31.551
But that's obviously not
a reason to replace him.

08:31.669 --> 08:33.419
- Can they replace the tooth?
- No, no.

08:33.505 --> 08:35.505
Ma'am, this is Special
Agent Marjorie Palmiotti.

08:35.590 --> 08:37.173
- Oh, hello.
- Hello, ma'am.

08:37.308 --> 08:38.841
- Agent?
- Palmiotti.

08:38.977 --> 08:40.977
- Palmiotti, okay. Welcome aboard.
- Thank you.

08:41.062 --> 08:42.979
Ma'am, a key requirement
for being lead agent

08:43.063 --> 08:45.598
is someone who looks like the
president, especially from behind,

08:45.683 --> 08:48.568
<i>to provide an additional decoy
target for any would-be assailants.</i>

08:48.686 --> 08:50.937
I'm a perfect match from behind.

08:51.022 --> 08:54.907
Um, okay, I'll tell you something.

08:55.026 --> 08:57.744
I am not quite seeing it,

08:57.862 --> 09:01.364
um, only because I'm...

09:03.034 --> 09:06.169
well, you are...

09:06.254 --> 09:07.067
Ma'am?

09:07.092 --> 09:09.529
It's just... would you mind
just giving us a second,

09:09.591 --> 09:12.508
Agent Palmi... thank you.

09:14.045 --> 09:17.797
Keith, are you really not
seeing what it is I'm seeing?

09:17.882 --> 09:20.133
- No, ma'am.
- Gary, can you help me out here?

09:20.218 --> 09:22.435
She smells completely
different, so, you know...

09:22.554 --> 09:24.937
- That is not what... it's not...
-<i> (KNOCKS)</i>

09:25.056 --> 09:27.890
Excuse me, ma'am, if you... I'm sorry.

09:28.026 --> 09:31.394
- What?
- You've got to see this, ma'am.

09:31.479 --> 09:33.896
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Pleasure to meet you, ma'am.

09:35.283 --> 09:37.116
Oh, shit.

09:37.235 --> 09:38.985
The big story at this moment... Nevada.

09:39.070 --> 09:40.787
<i>With all the votes now tallied,</i>

09:40.905 --> 09:43.956
Senator Bill O'Brien's lead
over President Selina Meyer

09:44.075 --> 09:47.460
is now less than half a percent,
which by Nevada state law

09:47.579 --> 09:49.662
<i>would allow for a possible recount.</i>

09:49.747 --> 09:52.298
If President Meyer
were to win a recount,

09:52.417 --> 09:54.417
she wins Nevada's six electoral votes

09:54.502 --> 09:56.335
- and therefore the presidency.
- Oh!

09:56.421 --> 09:58.921
- All the networks have it.
- "New York Times" as well.

09:59.007 --> 10:01.808
- Oh, my God! Oh, wait.
- (LAUGHING)

10:01.926 --> 10:04.844
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a
minute. Is this really happening?

10:04.929 --> 10:06.929
I mean, do we actually
have a chance at Nevada?

10:07.065 --> 10:08.681
- "Nev-add-a."
- Oh, my God.

10:08.766 --> 10:11.934
I get to be president. I don't
have to move. What do we do?

10:12.070 --> 10:13.820
Ma'am, we need to be sure
that when we get on...

10:13.938 --> 10:16.439
No, shut up, Kent. You already
lost Nevada for me once.

10:16.574 --> 10:18.658
- "Nev-add-a."
- Ben, what do we do?

10:18.776 --> 10:21.777
Uh, we need to get ahold of our
people in Nevada. Don't. Don't.

10:21.863 --> 10:24.247
RICHARD: <i>The vast majority of
Nevada voting is done by machine.</i>

10:24.332 --> 10:26.666
Once the Nevada Secretary of
State certifies the count,

10:26.784 --> 10:28.618
we'll then have 72 hours
to request a recount.

10:28.703 --> 10:31.420
At that point, 5% of the
precincts will be selected,

10:31.506 --> 10:32.872
and if there's a discrepancy
of more than 1%,

10:32.957 --> 10:35.007
a full hand recount will be requested.

10:35.126 --> 10:37.677
<i>I actually did my doctorate in
recount procedures in the West.</i>

10:37.795 --> 10:40.179
Excellent work, Richard.
Richard works for me.

10:40.298 --> 10:41.325
You have a doctorate?

10:41.350 --> 10:43.990
Two. Constitutional law
and veterinary medicine,

10:44.102 --> 10:46.102
- which was my fallback.
- But you were getting my coffee.

10:46.187 --> 10:48.855
Which is much harder 'cause you
have so many different moods.

10:48.973 --> 10:51.140
Like a half-caff and a
full-caff, macchiato.

10:51.226 --> 10:52.725
- "Ma-key-ato."
- <i> Macchiato.</i>

10:52.810 --> 10:56.195
Okay, Richard, you are going
to be my recount specialist.

10:56.314 --> 10:58.147
- Jonah, you're working for Richard.
- Wait, what?

10:58.233 --> 11:00.366
Amy, you got to sort
all of this out, okay?

11:00.485 --> 11:02.652
Ma'am, I really can't go to Nevada.
I'm not even really here.

11:02.737 --> 11:05.738
Ma'am, O'Brien is calling a press conference
in an hour to discuss the recount.

11:05.823 --> 11:07.823
I'm gonna talk in a half an hour, okay?

11:07.959 --> 11:09.625
I got to say stuff before he says stuff.

11:09.711 --> 11:11.744
- Listen, you got to write something up.
- I'm on it.

11:11.829 --> 11:14.664
- Right now. Ooh, recount, recount.
- I'm on it.

11:14.749 --> 11:16.382
Jonah, with me, please.

11:16.501 --> 11:20.336
This is highly enriched
weapons-grade bullshit.

11:20.471 --> 11:22.588
How dare she put you in charge of me?

11:22.674 --> 11:24.173
It's an outrage is what it is.

11:24.309 --> 11:26.175
It is an outrage, you know?

11:26.311 --> 11:27.760
She's Uncle Dursley and she's got

11:27.845 --> 11:31.647
the great wizard Harry Potter
living under the staircase.

11:31.733 --> 11:34.100
Do you see that? But what happens
in the Harry Potter books?

11:34.185 --> 11:36.018
He rises up and he
kills all the muggles.

11:36.104 --> 11:37.770
<i>I don't think that's what happens.</i>

support goes with this chair.

- GARY: Yeah, we're getting there.
- Okay, so what do you got?

11:47.031 --> 11:50.166
Am I still standing in barefaced awe of
the majesty of our democratic system?

11:50.251 --> 11:52.001

- This time, you're simply blessed.

Wow, I thought your last one
was flowery, vacuous nonsense.

12:00.878 --> 12:03.346
This one is much worse. Excellent, Mike.

12:03.431 --> 12:05.381
Gary, this is taking longer than it did

12:05.466 --> 12:07.412

fucking pool house.

I briefed you on the state
of affairs regarding...

12:26.321 --> 12:27.787

12:29.624 --> 12:31.741
it's still looking at you.

it Black Wednesday.

13:42.647 --> 13:44.864
Jesus, it's only Wednesday?

- Right.

Thank you, but no.

No, I would be blamed for

to be Treasury Secretary.

is any different than that.

18:06.911 --> 18:09.578
Well, respectfully, Madam
President, I hope you do

18:09.664 --> 18:11.463
because if the President
of the United States

can't tell the difference
between Treasury Secretary

18:13.918 --> 18:17.636

that's pretty disturbing.

18:17.755 --> 18:19.722
Then you accept?

18:20.975 --> 18:23.559
Madam President, it is a huge honor,

18:23.644 --> 18:27.646
but I have to balance that
against my need not to do it.

18:27.765 --> 18:30.265
Tom, I'm asking you

18:30.401 --> 18:33.068
as the President of the United States.

18:33.154 --> 18:36.021
And, respectfully, I am declining.

18:37.575 --> 18:39.358
I'm not picking up any respect.

18:39.443 --> 18:42.194
But you're getting the declining?

18:43.781 --> 18:46.782
Do you know what Candi
Caruso's real name is?

18:46.867 --> 18:50.002
It's Candice. And she changed
it to Candi with an I.

18:50.121 --> 18:51.787
If she does that to
her own goddamn name,

18:51.872 --> 18:54.456
how the hell is she going to
handle a potential recount?

18:54.542 --> 18:56.675
Good morning, Amy. This is
the president's schedule,

18:56.794 --> 18:59.128
which, incidentally, Ms.
Caruso is on right now.

18:59.213 --> 19:01.013
- AMY: <i> Oh, I'm aware.</i>
- Oh, good morning, ma'am.

19:01.132 --> 19:02.297
- Good morning.
- Hey, ma'am...

19:02.383 --> 19:04.466
Okay, I see you. You
stay away from my face.

19:04.602 --> 19:07.886
I hear you, but this is a family
recipe from my aunts in Savannah

19:07.972 --> 19:10.305
and they swear by it for
skin problems and migraines.

19:10.391 --> 19:10.933
Mm-hmm.

19:10.958 --> 19:12.582
Chickpea based, Tabasco,
with just a dash...

19:12.643 --> 19:14.560
All you're doing right
now is making me hungry.

19:14.645 --> 19:16.214
So why don't you do
something about that?

19:16.239 --> 19:16.836
Sure, sure.

19:16.947 --> 19:18.447
- Snack.
- Uh-huh, yeah.

19:18.532 --> 19:21.450
Amy, did you need me for anything?

19:21.535 --> 19:23.619
- No. I'm just chilling.
- No? Mmm.

19:25.539 --> 19:28.207
I think the most important
thing in terms of strategy

19:28.325 --> 19:29.908
is controlling the narrative.

19:29.994 --> 19:32.327
Oh, I have a saying. If you're
explaining, you're losing.

19:32.463 --> 19:34.329
Absolutely. I'm right on board with you.

19:34.465 --> 19:36.331
- Excuse me, Madam President.
- Amy.

19:36.467 --> 19:38.917
Have... have you met Candi?

19:39.003 --> 19:41.003
Hi, it's Candi with an I.

19:41.088 --> 19:43.172
Amy with a Y. Which is correct.

19:43.307 --> 19:45.841
We are right in the
middle of an interview

19:45.926 --> 19:49.595
with an exceptionally wonderful
candidate for coordinating Nevada.

19:49.680 --> 19:51.430
Ma'am, it's just gonna take a second.

19:51.515 --> 19:55.401
- Apologies. I'll be right back.
- Absolutely.

19:55.519 --> 19:57.770
- I got you a snack.
- Oh, yeah, give me that.

20:01.575 --> 20:03.242
That's a great dress.

20:03.360 --> 20:06.028
Oh, thank you.

20:06.113 --> 20:09.364
- Size two?
- Um...

20:09.500 --> 20:12.367
Ms. Caruso, the president
sends her apologies,

20:12.503 --> 20:13.919
but the position has been filled.

20:14.038 --> 20:15.954
- Ooh.
- Right this way.

20:16.040 --> 20:18.590
Okay.

20:18.709 --> 20:21.593
And if I need more clothes, then
I'll have you or Mom send them.

20:21.712 --> 20:24.296
Yeah, fine, bye. Richard.

20:24.381 --> 20:26.515
- What's this?
-<i> You know Jonah. He works for me.</i>

20:26.600 --> 20:28.467
In fact, you two used to date,
but you never got over him.

20:28.552 --> 20:30.352
Not Jonah. Why is baby
with a beard here?

20:30.438 --> 20:32.638
Oh, good, you remember Cliff.
He works for me now.

20:32.723 --> 20:34.356
I recruited him from Justice.

20:34.442 --> 20:36.525
The first of many appointments
I intend to make.

20:36.610 --> 20:39.645
Here, Richard, we need recount
lawyers in each county

20:39.730 --> 20:41.613
and we need housing for
all the volunteers.

20:41.732 --> 20:43.982
Could you take care of this, Jonah?

20:44.068 --> 20:47.736
Cliff, my plate is just full of shit right
now and I'd like for you to clean that.

20:47.822 --> 20:49.538
You know what? I'll do it. Yeah.

20:49.623 --> 20:51.957
- I love talking to people anyway.
- Get out.

20:52.076 --> 20:54.877
Out. Take that cushion with you.
That is disgusting.

20:54.962 --> 20:57.079
Actually, it goes with the seat,
so it should probably stay.

20:59.300 --> 21:00.966
- Madam President!
- (PEOPLE SHOUTING)

21:01.085 --> 21:04.470
I can't understand a word.

21:04.588 --> 21:08.173
This afternoon I asked Tom James

21:08.259 --> 21:10.058
to serve as economy czar

21:10.144 --> 21:11.927
and to my delight, he said yes.

21:12.062 --> 21:13.512
- Madam President!
- (ALL SHOUTING)

21:13.597 --> 21:18.267
Senator James' selflessness
is an inspiration to us all.

21:18.352 --> 21:22.104
Whatever useless, vain, vapid thing
you're doing right now, drop it.

21:22.189 --> 21:24.857
Well, I am enjoying a delicious sandwich

21:24.942 --> 21:27.659
made even more delicious by the fact that
there's a homeless guy watching me eat it.

21:27.778 --> 21:30.162
AMY: <i>I need you to get on this
plane to Nevada with me today.</i>

21:30.281 --> 21:31.580
Been there, got fucked by that.

21:31.665 --> 21:33.448
Cut the shit. You just got fired.

21:33.534 --> 21:35.450
- Purcell's told everyone in town.
- That fucker!

21:35.586 --> 21:38.453
Right now you're about as toxic
as a urinal cake in Chernobyl

21:38.539 --> 21:39.872
and I am offering you a job.

21:39.957 --> 21:41.790
You have exactly zero seconds to decide.

21:41.876 --> 21:43.876
You know, Candi Caruso
would have asked me nicer.

21:46.797 --> 21:49.798
Sue, the president's
remarks for the symposium.

21:49.884 --> 21:52.017
And... (POPS MOUTH) caught you.

21:52.136 --> 21:55.137
18,000 steps. I am Chinese baby ready.

21:55.272 --> 21:58.390
Oh, my God. Mike, when are the
auditions for "Music Man"?

21:58.475 --> 22:01.443
- (CHUCKLES)
- So how many flights, Mike?

22:01.529 --> 22:03.779
- What do you mean flights?
- <i> As in flights of stairs.</i>

22:03.864 --> 22:07.733
Burns way more calories. I
am at 22 flights today.

22:08.869 --> 22:11.570
How... stairs?

22:11.655 --> 22:12.988
The things you walk up and down.

22:13.123 --> 22:14.323
Hi, Sue. Is she busy?

22:14.458 --> 22:15.991
Oh, wow, never mind.

22:16.126 --> 22:19.328
- Oh, looky, looky.
- How could you do this?

22:19.413 --> 22:21.630
- What?
- I gave you my decision.

22:21.715 --> 22:23.882
- Oh, suck it.
- Excuse me?

22:24.001 --> 22:26.468
Yeah, you heard me. I LBJ'd you, okay?

22:26.554 --> 22:28.086
I'm the LBJ queen

22:28.172 --> 22:30.172
and you are Sargent "Suck It" Shriver.

22:30.257 --> 22:32.558
And now you have to excuse me,

22:32.676 --> 22:34.676
because this pimple isn't
getting any smaller.

22:34.762 --> 22:36.895
Kind of like the national debt.
(CHUCKLES)

22:37.014 --> 22:38.897
Hey, Sue, is Dr. Abernethy here?

22:39.016 --> 22:41.066
- Yes.
- Okay, send him in, please.

22:41.185 --> 22:43.685
- Do you mind? Hi there, Doctor.
- Madam President.

22:43.821 --> 22:45.904
You know Senator James.
He's our new economy czar.

22:46.023 --> 22:48.156
- Oh, congratulations, sir.
- Thank you.

22:48.242 --> 22:49.691
Prosperity is just around the corner.

22:49.827 --> 22:52.244
- Oh, good. Good, good.
- How may I help you?

22:52.363 --> 22:55.530
Well, you can get rid of this
Skittle that's embedded in my face.

22:55.616 --> 22:58.700
She's also got a mole near her
Spanx line and it's hidden...

22:58.786 --> 23:02.087
Yeah, and this thing up my ass
has got to get removed, too.

23:02.206 --> 23:04.373
- How are you, Gary?
- Fine. You?

23:04.458 --> 23:08.210
- Oh, yeah. That is really deep.
- See?

23:08.295 --> 23:09.595
What have you been doing?

23:09.713 --> 23:12.130
- Just putting heat on it.
- Well, hot heat.

23:12.216 --> 23:13.632
That's the last thing
you want to be doing.

23:13.717 --> 23:15.601
- SELINA: Okay.
- It wasn't that hot.

23:15.719 --> 23:17.386
Small cortisone shot
should take care of it.

23:17.471 --> 23:19.554
- Uh, excuse me, ma'am.
- SELINA: <i> Oh, yeah, come in.</i>

23:19.640 --> 23:22.608
We have to go over your opening
statement for the symposium.

23:22.726 --> 23:24.359
- Sure.
- KENT: <i> Also, ma'am,</i>

23:24.445 --> 23:26.528
catastrophic mudslides in Idaho.

23:26.614 --> 23:29.064
The governor is requesting a
federal state of emergency.

23:29.199 --> 23:31.783
- This should be cleared up in 24 hours.
- Okay.

23:31.902 --> 23:34.703
Just keep your skin free of
all irritants for a few days.

23:34.788 --> 23:37.990
- Ma'am, he said no irritants.
- You're an irritant.

23:38.075 --> 23:39.741
How much did we lose Idaho by?

23:39.877 --> 23:42.244
- Shellacked.
- Uh, well over 212,000 votes.

23:42.329 --> 23:45.330
Then I declare a state
of go fuck yourself.

23:45.416 --> 23:48.834
I'm not spending money to scrape
mud off a bunch of dirt roads.

23:48.919 --> 23:51.303
- You're not from Idaho, are you, Doctor?
- No, ma'am.

23:51.422 --> 23:53.338
I don't mean this to sound insensitive,

23:53.424 --> 23:56.224
but don't you think that mudslides

23:56.310 --> 23:58.510
are the funniest kind
of natural disasters?

23:58.595 --> 24:01.346
I've always been partial to sinkholes.
You know, ah!

24:01.432 --> 24:04.066
- (LAUGHS) Those are hilarious.
- KENT: <i> Nature's trapdoor.</i>

24:04.151 --> 24:07.352
Ma'am, makeup is an irritant
and we really need that.

24:07.438 --> 24:10.689
- Makeup is not an irritant.
- Actually, ma'am, yes, it is.

24:10.774 --> 24:14.076
Let's avoid any makeup on the
facial area for at least 48 hours.

24:14.161 --> 24:16.445
- You're gonna feel a small...
- Oh, no, we're not gonna do this.

24:16.530 --> 24:18.914
- But thanks for coming.
- Yes, ma'am.

24:18.999 --> 24:20.832
I'll show you out.

24:20.951 --> 24:22.784
SELINA: <i>We need to take a peek at this.</i>

24:22.920 --> 24:26.038
- KENT: <i> Thank you, Doc.</i>
- Cold compress, Gary.

24:26.123 --> 24:27.289
Whatever.

24:33.464 --> 24:34.164
I mean...

24:34.189 --> 24:36.288
Yeah, took the words
right out of my mouth.

24:36.350 --> 24:37.549
- Right?
- Yeah.

24:37.634 --> 24:40.218
- Ma'am?
- Hmm?

24:40.304 --> 24:43.939
Oh, Ben, were we able to get Dr.
Weisglass here today?

24:44.024 --> 24:44.741
Absolutely, ma'am.

24:44.766 --> 24:46.916
Okay. Oh, good, Catherine.
You're documenting this.

24:46.977 --> 24:51.229
Okay, welcome to the First
Annual Towards a New Promise...

24:51.315 --> 24:52.898
Mom, don't look into the camera.

24:52.983 --> 24:55.067
- Just pretend I'm not here.
- But you are here.

24:55.152 --> 24:57.536
Yeah, but that's the point of a
documentary film is that you're...

24:57.654 --> 24:59.988
Okay, I don't understand what this
project is at all. I don't get it.

25:00.124 --> 25:01.656
Catherine, why is that your hair?

25:01.792 --> 25:03.625

25:16.557 --> 25:17.086
Dr. Weisglass.

25:17.111 --> 25:18.697
Pleasure to see you
again, Madam President.

25:18.759 --> 25:20.726
I'm so pleased you were able to make it.

25:20.844 --> 25:23.061
And I'm really excited to start
this conversation today.

25:23.180 --> 25:25.263
- Yes, ma'am.
- Sam O'Keefe, also Harvard.

25:25.349 --> 25:27.682
I think what we're gonna
talk about today is hard,

25:27.768 --> 25:29.651
but I think it's going to be
worth it, don't you agree?

25:29.737 --> 25:31.269
- I agree, yes. Thank you.
- Good, good.

25:31.355 --> 25:33.655
Madam President, Elisa Burke,

Studies at Howard.

25:36.360 --> 25:39.361
- Oh, Ms. Burke, is it?
- Yes.

25:39.446 --> 25:42.030
Great. Well, every
difficult conversation

25:42.116 --> 25:45.367
starts with a sentence.

25:46.954 --> 25:49.421
What the fuck is going on here?
Why are they all white?

25:49.540 --> 25:51.506

Okay. Hello.

25:53.460 --> 25:55.677
Franklin Washington,
Morehouse University.

25:55.763 --> 25:57.846
Now, Morehouse University

25:57.931 --> 26:00.382
is historically an
African-American university.

26:00.467 --> 26:02.267
- Historically.
- Okay.

26:02.386 --> 26:04.186
We need to round up
some blacks and fast.

26:04.271 --> 26:07.639
- We need to round up...
- Don't say it over the radio, asshole.

26:07.724 --> 26:10.392
Richard! Oh, thank God.

26:10.477 --> 26:12.227
Go get Sue. We need her now.

26:12.362 --> 26:14.062
- Right now.
- Yeah.

26:14.198 --> 26:15.564
Folks, I look around here today

26:15.649 --> 26:18.233
and I see a rainbow of faces, you know?

26:18.368 --> 26:21.987
Faces from the savannahs of Africa

26:22.072 --> 26:25.490
to the cities and towns of England.

26:25.576 --> 26:28.076
Faces from... from Holland

26:28.212 --> 26:30.378
and even perhaps Norway.

Everyone remain calm.
We're in total lockdown

26:47.181 --> 26:48.980
- while we search the premises.
- We got her.

Whoa, whoa! I work here.

26:52.936 --> 26:55.437
- Huh? What happened?
- SUE: Ma'am?

26:55.522 --> 26:58.490
Mr. McLintock, why are there so few
people of color in the Meyer White House?

26:58.609 --> 27:00.442
Mike, does President Meyer
care about black people?

27:00.577 --> 27:02.994
Just moments ago, Bill Ericsson,

27:03.113 --> 27:05.113
former Director of White
House Communications,

27:05.249 --> 27:08.950
was arrested at his Kalorama home
and taken into federal custody.

27:09.086 --> 27:12.420
Due to the seriousness of the crimes
and despite rumors to the contrary,

27:12.506 --> 27:14.589
<i>a pardon is not on the table.</i>

27:14.675 --> 27:17.542
Regrettably, he was also
responsible for the chaos

27:17.628 --> 27:19.377
that occurred at the
symposium on race today.

27:19.463 --> 27:21.847
- Thank you. That's all for now.

Wow, he looks puffy on TV.

27:38.732 --> 27:40.782
Well, prison will get him in shape.

27:40.868 --> 27:43.818
Okay, now I've just got to blow
for, like, five minutes, all right?

27:43.904 --> 27:45.987
HART: <i>When we come back, a
wild day on Wall Street.</i>

27:46.073 --> 27:48.373
<i>And we'll go live to Nevada
where armies of staffers</i>

27:48.492 --> 27:51.326
<i>and volunteers for the Meyer
and O'Brien campaigns</i>

27:51.461 --> 27:55.580
are descending on the desert to
monitor and manage the recount.

28:03.423 --> 28:05.640
There are no more rooms at this hotel.

28:05.726 --> 28:08.226
Richard, have your people check us in.
We're going to the lounge.

28:08.345 --> 28:10.345
Jonah, take care of that.

28:10.430 --> 28:12.814
Cliff, would...

28:12.900 --> 28:14.683
Cliff?

28:14.768 --> 28:16.851
Cliff?

28:22.693 --> 28:24.693
Excuse me, are you in line?

28:24.778 --> 28:28.029
Does anybody know where the line ends?
