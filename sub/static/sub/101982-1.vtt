WEBVTT

00:55.330 --> 00:57.332
Hey, kiddo.

00:59.936 --> 01:01.470
Okay. What are you playing?

01:03.906 --> 01:07.275
<i>It's Okay
If You Fly Away, Butterfly.</i>

01:07.309 --> 01:09.712
- Did you write that?
- Mm-hmm.

01:09.746 --> 01:10.947
- I love it.
- It's right here.

01:10.980 --> 01:12.447
Oh, it's right there.
Those are the notes?

01:15.952 --> 01:18.855
- What's that?
- It's for you.

01:21.724 --> 01:24.961
- "Thug Life."
- Thug life.

01:24.994 --> 01:28.263
- You made this at school?
- Yes.

01:28.296 --> 01:30.565
Did your
Uncle Tyler tell you that?

01:30.600 --> 01:33.670
- Yes.
- Of course, he did.

01:33.703 --> 01:35.504
And I'm sure I'm going
to hear about that.

01:36.739 --> 01:37.740
Did you like the movie?

01:40.475 --> 01:44.279
- Well, I have a question.
- Okay, what's your question?

01:44.312 --> 01:46.716
Doesn't live action mean,
like, live actors?

01:46.749 --> 01:48.785
- Mm-hmm.
- Then, I was thinking

01:48.818 --> 01:51.688
why do they call the new
<i>Lion King</i> movie live-action...

01:52.822 --> 01:55.625
when it's all CGI animals
and no people?

01:57.359 --> 01:58.360
Uh...

01:59.996 --> 02:03.666
Because the people
in charge of that are...

02:03.700 --> 02:06.468
not as smart as you.
Uh, and neither am I.

02:06.501 --> 02:10.707
- Okay. Go to bed.
- I am in bed.

02:13.042 --> 02:15.812
Go to sleep.

02:15.845 --> 02:18.346
You can't just tell
somebody to go to sleep

02:18.380 --> 02:21.349
and just expect them to close
their eyes and go to sleep.

02:21.383 --> 02:23.318
I have a lot on my mind, dude.

02:23.351 --> 02:26.321
- Your mother and I ever tell you you're adopted?
- Hilarious.

02:26.354 --> 02:27.890
Mm. Go to sleep.

02:27.924 --> 02:31.426
- But...
- Go... to... sleep!

02:32.527 --> 02:34.864
I will if you do the line.

02:36.431 --> 02:39.936
- "Okay, what's in the box?"
- Quit it.

02:41.938 --> 02:44.406
Okay, do not tell your mom
I let you watch that, okay?

02:44.439 --> 02:47.375
- Yes.
- Good. Okay. Lights out.

02:47.409 --> 02:51.614
Yeah, yeah.
I'm going to get this off. Okay, Mia.

02:56.819 --> 02:57.820
Goodnight, butterfly.

07:51.981 --> 07:54.950
Got to go back there and look again!
I know what I saw!

07:54.984 --> 07:58.154
We searched his entire place.
We didn't find anything.

07:58.187 --> 08:00.122
And by the way,
he was very cooperative.

08:00.156 --> 08:02.625
He let us do all of that
without a warrant.

08:02.658 --> 08:07.129
Besides, you said it yourself,
you saw it for a second from a distance

08:07.163 --> 08:09.799
- at night.
- No! Do not do that! I am not crazy.

08:09.832 --> 08:14.003
- I know what I fucking saw!
- Okay! Okay, here's what I need you to do for me.

08:14.036 --> 08:18.674
I need you to calm down, okay?
I didn't say you were crazy.

08:18.707 --> 08:23.079
You just lost your daughter, and you needing
someone to blame is completely understandable,

08:23.112 --> 08:26.782
but accusing someone of murder
requires evidence.

08:30.820 --> 08:34.657
I understand what you're going through.

08:34.690 --> 08:37.793
And I know that you're trying to
deal with this all in your own way,

08:37.827 --> 08:41.864
but finding your daughter's
killer is my job,

08:41.897 --> 08:43.632
and this grief counselor...

08:44.834 --> 08:46.001
is really good at hers.

09:13.462 --> 09:17.900
Look, she's wrong.
It's him. I know it.

09:17.933 --> 09:23.105
It doesn't matter!
It won't bring her back.

09:23.139 --> 09:27.776
She's gone. Our baby's gone,
and you can't fix it.

09:28.777 --> 09:30.646
You can't fix anything.

09:31.947 --> 09:36.952
You can't bring her back to me.
You can't.

09:38.954 --> 09:41.323
All right.

09:41.357 --> 09:45.294
All right. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

10:22.331 --> 10:23.332
Jess?

10:29.371 --> 10:30.372
Jess?

10:38.380 --> 10:39.381
Jess?

11:17.152 --> 11:19.355
<i>Hey, Ryan. It's Frank.</i>

11:20.422 --> 11:21.890
<i>I just...</i>

11:21.924 --> 11:26.428
<i>Everyone in the office, we're all
thinking about you... and Jessie.</i>

11:57.259 --> 11:59.361
Hell, I don't really know what
I'm going do with this place.

11:59.395 --> 12:03.198
Hell, nobody even touched it since all
that shit went down with the press it got.

12:03.232 --> 12:05.067
How many women is it
up to now? What, 50?

12:06.035 --> 12:08.137
- Fifty-three.
- Jesus.

12:08.638 --> 12:10.406
Yeah, some people.

12:12.441 --> 12:13.442
After you.

12:14.376 --> 12:15.377
Don't mind the smell.

12:17.313 --> 12:20.316
Well, you wanted
to see it, and here it is. Yeah.

12:20.349 --> 12:23.819
Speedy, the custodian,
he lived down here for 15 years.

12:25.120 --> 12:27.122
He didn't really have much.

12:27.156 --> 12:28.223
Didn't really want much, either.

12:29.358 --> 12:31.193
He, uh, took two to the chest

12:31.226 --> 12:34.029
trying to stop that robbery over
at the Sip and Slip last month.

12:34.698 --> 12:36.999
Yeah. I guess that's the...

12:38.334 --> 12:40.469
risk you take for trying
to be a hero, huh?

12:42.438 --> 12:46.909
The, uh, sink and toilet,
shower, they all work,

12:46.942 --> 12:48.944
- but I like I said...
- No one comes down here?

12:48.977 --> 12:49.978
The building, I mean?

12:51.246 --> 12:52.247
Not even on a dare.

12:54.416 --> 12:55.551
Listen, uh...

12:55.585 --> 12:58.354
Look, I don't know what your deal
is, but if you're...

12:58.387 --> 13:00.022
planning on doing
anything illegal here...

13:00.055 --> 13:01.523
It's nothing like that.

13:01.557 --> 13:02.925
Well, then, what is it?

13:04.426 --> 13:07.162
I mean, we drove
here in your car...

13:07.196 --> 13:09.031
you talk like you got a
degree on the wall at home,

13:09.064 --> 13:11.133
so I mean,
I ain't no scab-picker.

13:11.166 --> 13:14.103
I definitely ain't one to turn
down free money, but, uh...

13:14.136 --> 13:16.305
Look, I'm not going
to do anything illegal.

13:16.338 --> 13:18.006
I'm not going to cause you
any problems.

13:18.040 --> 13:19.642
Is this enough for a month?

13:28.350 --> 13:31.453
"Split all ends up,
and they shall not crack."

13:31.487 --> 13:33.021
"And death shall
have no dominion."

13:36.626 --> 13:37.627
Yeah.

15:22.632 --> 15:24.734
<i>Come on!</i>

15:25.501 --> 15:26.568
<i>Come on, gorilla!</i>

15:27.402 --> 15:30.339
<i>Mia Manila!
Come on! Come on!</i>

15:37.246 --> 15:40.449
<i>Get up. Get up!</i>

15:40.482 --> 15:42.150
<i>What the hell are you doing?</i>

15:42.184 --> 15:44.621
- <i>It was Ryan's idea.</i>
- <i>What?</i>

15:44.654 --> 15:47.089
<i>Not me. It was not me.</i>

15:54.196 --> 15:56.498
...behind that jab,
double it up, triple it up.

15:56.532 --> 15:58.601
Wait for him to drop his hands.

16:16.251 --> 16:17.687
Work the jab.
Work the jab.

16:35.337 --> 16:37.105
You had the slip.
Move. Move!

16:38.140 --> 16:39.141
Circle.

16:52.354 --> 16:53.555
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:02.765 --> 17:04.433
- You hungry?
- Yeah.

17:19.916 --> 17:22.284
So, you and Jess...

17:22.317 --> 17:24.252
Jess is fine. She's...

17:25.622 --> 17:26.623
you know, at her sisters.

17:28.591 --> 17:30.359
Um...

17:30.392 --> 17:33.228
How's... How's, uh,
Charkhian looking?

17:35.564 --> 17:38.601
You know,
you had a shot there.

17:38.635 --> 17:41.536
- I had a shot at doing what...
- Ty.

17:41.570 --> 17:43.940
You know, I mean, if I hadn't done five...
Yeah, I get it.

17:43.973 --> 17:46.909
Why don't you go down
to the store, get some salt...

17:46.943 --> 17:48.678
- Jesus Christ. Relax.
- ...rub it in my fucking eye.

17:48.711 --> 17:50.813
- You fucking relax. I'm completely relaxed.
- I am relaxed.

17:50.847 --> 17:53.616
- Why don't you stop losing hair?
- It's a little late for that.

17:56.686 --> 17:57.687
So, um...

18:00.455 --> 18:03.191
- So, the house...
- House is...

18:04.393 --> 18:05.394
fine.

18:06.596 --> 18:07.630
I just, uh...

18:09.331 --> 18:10.600
I couldn't do what
I needed to do there.

18:14.804 --> 18:17.205
And what the fuck's
that supposed to mean?

18:19.976 --> 18:21.176
Have a seat.

18:27.282 --> 18:28.283
Take a look.

18:46.002 --> 18:47.369
What the fuck am I looking at?

18:50.272 --> 18:51.440
That's the guy who killed Mia.

18:59.314 --> 19:00.616
I need you to get me a gun, Ty.

19:10.626 --> 19:11.627
Here you go.

19:36.652 --> 19:38.955
So tell me, what's the plan?

19:40.522 --> 19:43.492
I get you a gun,
and you just go over there

19:43.525 --> 19:45.360
and cap this motherfucker
like Sam Jackson?

19:47.730 --> 19:50.733
Well, I'll get him to admit it
first, but after that, um...

19:52.400 --> 19:55.403
yeah. Pretty much after that.

19:55.437 --> 19:58.908
Pretty much after that.
So you're just fucking Keyser Soze here?

19:58.941 --> 20:00.509
You ever been
to prison, dumbass?

20:00.542 --> 20:02.945
Because I have,
and this, by the way,

20:02.979 --> 20:05.447
real good training camp
for the fucking Hoosegow.

20:06.616 --> 20:08.416
As far as getting
the truth out of him...

20:09.819 --> 20:11.486
I'd really like
to fuck Taylor Swift.

20:11.520 --> 20:12.822
Look, he killed Mia!

20:13.990 --> 20:17.492
He took her,
and he killed her and...

20:17.526 --> 20:22.799
and now he just gets to live
his creepy-ass... No. No!

20:24.033 --> 20:25.034
He...

20:26.903 --> 20:28.805
I know it,

20:28.838 --> 20:31.607
and I need this to end,
and I need to end him.

20:38.380 --> 20:39.582
Look, are you gonna
help me or not?

20:55.497 --> 20:58.835
Give me a minute, man.
I need a minute, okay?

21:07.777 --> 21:08.778
I'm gonna call an Uber.

21:10.980 --> 21:11.981
I'm gonna call an Uber.

22:05.701 --> 22:07.169
I need to hear you
say it one more time.

22:07.837 --> 22:12.407
You're sure this guy is the guy?

22:14.744 --> 22:15.912
I'm positive.

22:18.014 --> 22:20.049
Fuck me.

22:23.586 --> 22:26.789
All right, man. Well,
if you're going to do this...

22:26.822 --> 22:30.492
the most you ever want him
to be is a missing person...

22:30.525 --> 22:34.130
<i>which means you're gonna have to
make it look like he took a trip...</i>

22:35.698 --> 22:37.499
<i>plant a receipt.</i>

22:37.532 --> 22:39.168
I don't know.
Train ticket, something.

22:41.771 --> 22:43.973
- As for the body...
- I got a plan for that.

22:45.942 --> 22:48.244
I'm thinking the lake
or the woods,

22:48.277 --> 22:50.146
but I'm leaning
towards the woods.

22:50.179 --> 22:53.649
- A boat?
- Exactly.

22:53.683 --> 22:56.619
And in the woods,
I got more cover, so...

22:56.652 --> 22:58.520
Well, that makes it easy then,
doesn't it?

23:06.829 --> 23:09.765
<i>Besides, there's one thing that's
more important than any of that shit, man.</i>

23:11.233 --> 23:14.670
You have to go
into this cold, not hot.

23:14.704 --> 23:17.572
There's not going to be a minute
to second guess yourself, so,

23:17.606 --> 23:22.044
do you think you have it
in you to not do that?

23:24.313 --> 23:25.513
Yeah.

23:35.291 --> 23:36.491
All right, man.

23:37.994 --> 23:38.995
I'll get you a gun...

23:40.262 --> 23:41.697
but I'm also going
to help you do it.

23:41.731 --> 23:44.033
No. No, Ty.
I can't ask you to do that.

23:44.066 --> 23:46.534
Fuck you!
Fuck you, all right?

23:46.568 --> 23:49.205
Mia was my goddaughter,
so that's the deal.

23:49.238 --> 23:50.239
Take it or leave it.

23:55.578 --> 23:58.513
Look, man. I know it doesn't
feel like it now, but...

24:00.349 --> 24:03.819
you could
actually still have...

24:06.322 --> 24:08.758
a life after this.

24:10.793 --> 24:11.694
but only if you do it right,

24:11.727 --> 24:14.063
which means
you are going to need help.

24:17.033 --> 24:18.167
Hell, man, I would too.

24:25.641 --> 24:26.642
All right, then.

24:29.178 --> 24:30.179
Let's get to it.

24:44.827 --> 24:45.828
It's clean.

24:58.040 --> 24:59.175
You sure this guy's home?

25:00.342 --> 25:01.811
He is...

25:02.678 --> 25:04.180
This guy's been my...

25:08.084 --> 25:11.220
He closed all his blinds
a few days ago for some reason,

25:13.055 --> 25:15.591
but he hasn't
broken his routine.

25:17.159 --> 25:19.295
Same rooms light up
at the same times.

25:22.798 --> 25:23.966
All right, then.

25:26.268 --> 25:27.870
Just like we planned, right?

26:32.168 --> 26:33.202
He's out.

27:30.259 --> 27:32.094
Let's just put him down.

28:06.962 --> 28:08.998
Didn't what's-his-face
used to live here?

28:09.365 --> 28:11.133
Huh?

28:11.166 --> 28:13.002
I don't know. Let's just...
Could we just get this done?

28:13.035 --> 28:14.036
Come on.

28:18.140 --> 28:21.410
- Okay, here we go. Okay.
- Wait, wait, wait. All right.

28:25.914 --> 28:27.383
- Oh! Oh!
- Oh, crap!

28:28.450 --> 28:30.119
Are you okay?

28:30.152 --> 28:32.821
- Up... means...
- I heard you.

28:32.855 --> 28:34.923
- Come on. Are you okay?
- ...direction. Yes.

28:36.959 --> 28:38.193
Just stand up.

28:39.228 --> 28:41.163
- One, two, three. Up!
- Fuck!

28:42.131 --> 28:44.967
- One, two, three, up!
- Yeah.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.069
In the seat.

28:51.507 --> 28:52.808
Fuck.

28:58.480 --> 29:00.916
Okay. Can you get the stuff?

29:08.957 --> 29:09.958
Fuck it.

29:23.072 --> 29:24.907
Remember me, Mr. Granger?

29:30.613 --> 29:31.914
You're...

29:36.151 --> 29:37.953
You're Ryan Olsen,

29:38.688 --> 29:40.356
- the father of...
- Mia.

29:42.157 --> 29:43.192
The girl you murdered.

29:44.059 --> 29:45.928
No, I did not.

29:45.961 --> 29:47.162
Don't lie to me!

29:53.102 --> 29:54.370
(SIGHS)

29:57.306 --> 29:59.541
I'm not calling
the cops this time.

29:59.575 --> 30:04.079
It's just you and me.
I've been watching you, asshole.

30:05.547 --> 30:08.651
I know what you are,
and I know what I saw.

30:08.685 --> 30:12.187
You sitting at
your kitchen table,

30:12.221 --> 30:18.026
holding my daughter's favorite butterfly
hairclip in your creepy-ass hands.

30:18.060 --> 30:19.428
Are you gonna tell me I didn't?

30:19.461 --> 30:21.397
Yes. I mean, no.

30:23.065 --> 30:24.166
I said...

30:26.201 --> 30:28.070
Look,

30:28.103 --> 30:31.073
look, I let the police
search my house.

30:31.106 --> 30:33.275
They didn't even have a
warrant, but I let them,

30:33.308 --> 30:35.578
and they didn't find it
because I never had it.

30:35.612 --> 30:36.945
Please...

30:38.147 --> 30:40.482
You're welcome to search...

30:40.516 --> 30:42.217
Search my house.

30:43.653 --> 30:45.220
I could never
do that to a child.

30:45.254 --> 30:46.589
I couldn't. I wouldn't.

30:50.058 --> 30:52.928
Please. You have to believe me.

30:56.231 --> 30:59.636
I'm sorry, Stan,
but I don't.

31:04.707 --> 31:05.708
Hammett.

31:08.544 --> 31:10.713
Yeah, okay. I'm on my way.

31:10.747 --> 31:12.514
You want me to stop?

31:12.548 --> 31:13.616
Yes.

31:13.650 --> 31:14.684
Then tell me!

31:15.785 --> 31:17.152
Tell me what I want to know!

31:17.654 --> 31:18.655
Tell me!

31:19.622 --> 31:22.124
Aw, fuck!

31:23.660 --> 31:27.262
Just tell me and I'll stop.
I promise!

31:28.096 --> 31:29.231
I didn't.

31:29.264 --> 31:30.733
Ow, fuck.

31:30.767 --> 31:31.967
Ryan,

31:32.802 --> 31:34.069
come on.

31:35.471 --> 31:36.706
He ain't goin' anywhere.

32:00.329 --> 32:02.331
It ain't broke, man.
You just gotta ice it.

32:10.539 --> 32:13.743
He's gonna break. I know it.

32:15.444 --> 32:17.814
I don't know, man.

32:17.847 --> 32:20.048
No, look, all we have to do
is go down there and, like,

32:20.082 --> 32:21.517
what do you mean,
you don't know?

32:21.550 --> 32:23.118
What, you mean, you don't know

32:23.151 --> 32:24.754
- or you mean you don't know?
- No, no, I just...

32:24.787 --> 32:26.288
I just mean...

32:28.691 --> 32:31.493
I don't know if you're gonna
get to bang Taylor before we...

32:32.194 --> 32:33.362
You know...

32:52.649 --> 32:53.816
Show me.

33:05.561 --> 33:09.264
All right, get forensics out here.
K-9 units, too.

33:09.298 --> 33:11.668
And seal off the road.
No one comes in or out.

33:21.711 --> 33:22.679
Yeah, what do you got?

33:22.712 --> 33:25.180
I need the past 72 hours
of traffic-cam footage

33:25.213 --> 33:28.250
for the two streets that go in and
out of the old Chalmers backroad.

33:28.283 --> 33:29.819
There's no traffic-cams
on Chalmers,

33:29.852 --> 33:30.887
but there are on the other two

33:30.920 --> 33:32.120
and we might
catch a break there.

33:34.591 --> 33:38.460
Yeah. I'll be here until forensics
is done bagging everything.

33:46.401 --> 33:48.671
Explain a few things
to me, Stan.

33:50.405 --> 33:54.877
What would a single
man with no kids

33:54.911 --> 33:59.548
be buying boxes of children's
vitamins and stuffed animals for?

34:00.850 --> 34:04.654
Are you going to kill me?

34:07.255 --> 34:08.357
Depends

34:09.491 --> 34:10.860
on your answers.

34:13.195 --> 34:14.229
Okay.

34:16.264 --> 34:18.200
- My niece.
- Your niece?

34:19.301 --> 34:23.372
My niece, she just turned three,

34:23.405 --> 34:27.342
and I sent the toys
to her for her birthday.

34:29.612 --> 34:32.582
And the vitamins,

34:32.615 --> 34:35.652
are you gonna tell me you sent
those to her for her birthday too?

34:35.918 --> 34:36.919
No.

34:41.624 --> 34:42.925
What?

34:42.959 --> 34:44.594
What, Stan?

34:44.627 --> 34:45.662
It's...

34:46.361 --> 34:48.631
It's em...
it's embarrassing.

34:48.665 --> 34:49.932
I take them.

34:49.966 --> 34:52.234
I prefer them over the adult.

34:53.736 --> 34:54.771
Okay.

35:06.015 --> 35:08.985
Explain this, asshole.

35:09.018 --> 35:10.485
<i>Bonding with Captors?</i>

35:10.519 --> 35:14.389
Are you gonna tell me you're reading
that for some fucking book club?

35:15.892 --> 35:16.959
Hey!

35:21.329 --> 35:22.699
This is a mistake.

35:22.732 --> 35:24.667
In case you missed it,

35:24.701 --> 35:27.436
this is your one chance
to save yourself,

35:27.469 --> 35:31.373
so stop fucking crying
and start talking!

35:31.406 --> 35:33.843
But you've already
made up your mind

35:33.876 --> 35:35.978
or you wouldn't be doing this.

35:36.012 --> 35:38.246
Start talking! Talk now!

35:38.280 --> 35:39.682
- Oh, God!
- Or so help me God,

35:39.716 --> 35:42.250
I will pull this
fucking trigger!

35:42.284 --> 35:43.986
- Talk!
- It happened to me!

35:44.020 --> 35:45.822
What? What happened to you?

35:45.855 --> 35:49.424
It happened to me!
It happened.

35:51.694 --> 35:52.762
Hey!

35:52.795 --> 35:56.398
I didn't do this,
so help me God.

35:56.431 --> 35:58.901
I never touched your daughter.

36:02.370 --> 36:04.272
You have the wrong man.

36:20.590 --> 36:22.692
Tell me what happened to you.

36:54.924 --> 36:56.592
All right.

37:01.831 --> 37:02.999
I don't know.

37:04.634 --> 37:07.302
Maybe Detective Hammett
was right. Maybe...

37:08.671 --> 37:10.673
Maybe, I didn't see it.

37:10.706 --> 37:12.742
If you say you saw it,
then I know you did.

37:12.775 --> 37:14.610
Come on, you're not actually
starting to believe him,

37:14.644 --> 37:15.778
are you?

37:15.812 --> 37:16.846
I don't know.

37:17.880 --> 37:18.915
You?

37:18.948 --> 37:21.584
Me? It doesn't fuckin' matter.

37:21.617 --> 37:23.518
You know what the minimum
sentence for kidnapping is?

37:23.552 --> 37:26.022
It's 20 fucking years.
We still gotta go to the woods,

37:26.055 --> 37:28.624
we still gotta dig the hole
before the sun's up.

37:28.658 --> 37:30.092
Look, I just...

37:31.493 --> 37:32.995
I have to be sure.

37:33.029 --> 37:37.834
You are. "I'm positive."
That's what you said.

37:37.867 --> 37:40.102
How the fuck are you gonna be
more sure than you already were

37:40.136 --> 37:41.604
I'm gonna find it.

37:43.673 --> 37:46.943
Hey, any mess you make,
we gotta... Ah, fuck off.

38:08.831 --> 38:11.033
You're going to
die tonight, Stan.

38:12.001 --> 38:14.369
Only question is quick or slow?

38:15.037 --> 38:18.808
See, I can't talk Ryan down,

38:18.841 --> 38:24.647
but if you come clean
about what you did,

38:24.680 --> 38:27.850
I can promise it'll be quick.

38:29.051 --> 38:31.954
It's Ty, right?

38:31.988 --> 38:34.522
Tyler. We ain't
fuckin' friends, asshole.

38:34.556 --> 38:38.961
May I ask if you
believe in God?

38:38.995 --> 38:41.631
Do I look like
a fuckin' Christian to you?

38:41.664 --> 38:43.966
You know what Gandhi
said about Christians?

38:44.000 --> 38:46.534
Do I look like I fuckin' care?

38:46.568 --> 38:49.605
He said, "I like your Christ.
I do not like your Christians.

38:49.639 --> 38:52.474
"Your Christians are
so unlike your Christ." No.

38:52.507 --> 38:57.580
<i>I do not mean a belief derived
from an institution built by men</i>

38:57.613 --> 39:00.883
<i>seeking only to serve
their own selfish interests,</i>

39:04.787 --> 39:07.489
But a true belief, which I have.

39:08.591 --> 39:11.193
And I swear to you
by that belief,

39:11.227 --> 39:17.700
I had nothing to do with what
happened to Ryan's daughter, Tyler.

39:18.601 --> 39:19.969
Ooh!

39:38.688 --> 39:41.023
What the fuck
are you doing, man?

39:41.057 --> 39:42.892
You want a fucking
confession, right?

39:42.925 --> 39:45.761
What d... Stop!
Just get it the fuck out!

39:55.004 --> 39:56.939
What the fuck
are you doing, man?

39:56.973 --> 39:58.573
Let's just get this over with.

39:58.607 --> 40:00.943
I... okay, I'm not ready.

41:06.142 --> 41:09.045
Mr. Granger?
Detective Hammett!

41:24.326 --> 41:25.895
I just wanna talk.

43:41.530 --> 43:43.465
- Hey, you good?
- Yeah.

43:43.499 --> 43:45.501
I put him down the second I heard
it, man. I...

43:45.534 --> 43:47.803
What the fuck?

43:47.836 --> 43:48.771
- You think she knows?
- No.

43:48.804 --> 43:50.105
No, she woulda kicked in
the door if she did.

43:50.139 --> 43:52.107
She was here for him.
That was, uh...

43:52.141 --> 43:54.176
the lead detective
on Mia's case.

43:58.247 --> 44:00.049
What if she finally
has something on him?

44:02.785 --> 44:06.222
Do I really got to explain to
you how fucking stupid this is?

44:06.255 --> 44:07.289
I gotta know.

44:07.323 --> 44:09.925
So we do it, and then
you call her and find out.

44:09.959 --> 44:11.961
No. No, 'cause if this has
anything to do with Mia's case...

44:11.994 --> 44:14.063
- God damn it, man.
- This is exactly what I...

44:14.096 --> 44:15.464
You always
second-guess yourself.

44:15.497 --> 44:20.502
Shut up! It's my daughter!
It's my fucking daughter!

44:27.343 --> 44:29.345
We have plenty of time.

44:42.057 --> 44:43.158
Hammett.

44:43.192 --> 44:47.263
Uh, Detective.
Hi, it's... it's Ryan...

44:47.296 --> 44:48.330
Olsen.

44:48.364 --> 44:51.267
Hi, Mr. Olsen.
It's pretty late.

44:51.300 --> 44:53.068
Yeah, no... I know.
I'm sorry about the hour.

44:53.102 --> 44:55.971
I just... I really
needed to talk to you.

44:56.005 --> 44:58.340
Sure. Listen, I know
it's been a while,

44:58.374 --> 45:00.509
but I want you to know we're
still doing everything we can

45:00.542 --> 45:03.345
<i>on your daughter's case.</i>

45:03.379 --> 45:10.319
Yeah. Is there, um... Is there anything
new, uh, that I should know about?

45:10.352 --> 45:12.321
Well, it's
an open investigation,

45:12.354 --> 45:15.057
so unfortunately,
as much as I'd like to,

45:15.090 --> 45:17.559
<i>there are certain things
I really can't get into.</i>

45:17.594 --> 45:21.163
Right. Right. Um, well...

45:21.196 --> 45:25.901
The reason I called is, um, I...
I actually have some information about,

45:25.934 --> 45:29.905
uh, Stan Granger
that I... I thought,

45:29.938 --> 45:32.141
uh, you might want
to know about.

45:36.445 --> 45:40.349
I really hope you haven't been
doing anything stupid, Mr. Olsen.

45:40.382 --> 45:43.319
<i>Yeah. That makes two of us.</i>

45:46.922 --> 45:51.293
Okay, listen, I'm actually in
your neighborhood right now,

45:51.327 --> 45:54.930
<i>so maybe it'd be better
if we talk in person.</i>

45:54.963 --> 45:58.367
<i>How about I stop by in,
say, ten minutes?</i>

46:00.102 --> 46:01.103
Okay.

46:05.240 --> 46:07.409
Fuck. Ow!
Some fuckin' bullshit!

46:07.443 --> 46:08.544
Look, I have to know.

46:08.577 --> 46:10.179
At least leave me
the gun, dumbass.

46:11.113 --> 46:13.415
Shit. Take it.
Thank you.

46:40.109 --> 46:41.243
Detective.

46:42.311 --> 46:43.412
Mr. Olsen.

46:49.318 --> 46:50.986
How are you holding up?

46:53.723 --> 46:54.556
And your wife?

46:54.591 --> 46:58.026
Uh, she's... She's okay.
Uh, fine.

46:58.060 --> 47:02.131
Actually, she's staying at her
sister's for a... for a little bit.

47:02.164 --> 47:03.633
So...

47:03.666 --> 47:06.034
I don't suppose you ever
called that number I gave you?

47:10.072 --> 47:11.708
It's on my list of things to do.

47:11.741 --> 47:14.143
Well, for what
it's worth, I've...

47:14.176 --> 47:16.145
I've known a few people
who have been where you are,

47:16.178 --> 47:18.414
and they all say that
talking to someone helps.

47:18.447 --> 47:20.215
with a lot of things.

47:20.249 --> 47:22.317
Food for thought.

47:22.351 --> 47:28.023
Anyway, you said you had some
information for me about Stan Granger.

47:28.056 --> 47:34.597
Could you at least tell me if there have
been any developments in Mia's case?

47:34.631 --> 47:36.999
I'm still doing
everything that I can,

47:37.032 --> 47:38.167
and, but nothing new
has come up.

47:38.200 --> 47:40.737
And I'm sorry, I know that's
not what you want to hear,

47:40.770 --> 47:43.038
but you'll be the first to know,

47:43.071 --> 47:44.506
I promise, once I
have something.

47:44.540 --> 47:47.109
And, uh, Stan Granger,

47:47.142 --> 47:49.945
has he been completely
eliminated as a...

47:51.280 --> 47:53.215
a... a suspect?

47:53.248 --> 47:56.084
That's not really how it works.

47:56.118 --> 47:57.519
We go where
the evidence takes us,

47:57.553 --> 48:00.389
and there simply is
no evidence implicating Granger.

48:00.422 --> 48:02.491
Now, you said you had something.

48:04.794 --> 48:06.094
Um...

48:09.364 --> 48:10.432
Here.

48:19.107 --> 48:20.409
Look, I know how this looks,

48:20.442 --> 48:23.680
and I know that none of it
may actually be

48:23.713 --> 48:27.382
evidence, uh, but you
have to admit that...

48:28.484 --> 48:29.518
What?

48:32.521 --> 48:36.291
You said he closed all of
his blinds three days ago?

48:37.426 --> 48:39.027
Mm-hmm.

48:40.295 --> 48:41.296
Okay.

48:42.064 --> 48:43.733
Look,

48:43.766 --> 48:48.504
Stan Granger did actually just pop
up on my radar again very recently.

48:48.537 --> 48:52.107
Now it's for a different case,
and an open investigation,

48:52.140 --> 48:54.409
so I can't get into the details.

48:54.443 --> 48:57.212
And as a police officer,
I can't say I approve

48:57.246 --> 48:58.781
of what you've been doing,

48:58.815 --> 49:02.351
so I certainly couldn't ask you to
take part in an official investigation,

49:02.384 --> 49:04.621
even if you are practically
neighbors with him

49:04.654 --> 49:08.090
and might be in a position to

49:08.123 --> 49:10.459
take a look at his van
and relay back

49:10.492 --> 49:13.562
whether or not
it's been freshly painted,

49:13.596 --> 49:18.400
which is information that might
be of interest to certain parties.

49:23.505 --> 49:24.707
Mm-hmm.

49:26.308 --> 49:29.044
Okay, uh,
thanks again for meeting me.

49:30.379 --> 49:31.480
I didn't.

49:49.632 --> 49:53.502
<i>It's been three days since Clara
Bloom was last seen by her family.</i>

49:53.535 --> 49:56.606
<i>The five-year-old was believed
to have been on Chalmers Road</i>

49:56.639 --> 50:00.075
<i>near the Como Zoo with
classmates on a field trip</i>

50:00.677 --> 50:02.444
<i>before she disappeared.</i>

50:02.477 --> 50:04.614
<i>The police are asking
anyone with leads</i>

50:04.647 --> 50:06.849
<i>to call the number
on the screen.</i>

50:06.883 --> 50:08.150
<i>Thanks, Francine.</i>

50:08.183 --> 50:10.552
<i>Once again, for those of you
just joining us, Salisbury...</i>

50:13.355 --> 50:14.423
Shit.

50:18.895 --> 50:23.298
- You think he painted it?
- I do.

50:23.332 --> 50:25.334
I remember you looking at
this guy for the Olsen girl.

50:26.501 --> 50:28.738
The father stated
that he saw Granger

50:28.771 --> 50:31.573
in possession of a hair clip
that belonged to the vic.

50:31.608 --> 50:35.177
Granger let us conduct a search
on his property voluntarily,

50:35.210 --> 50:37.880
but we came up empty,
and, I mean,

50:37.914 --> 50:40.750
beyond the father's insistence
that he was guilty,

50:40.783 --> 50:43.485
we really didn't have a reason
to like him for it,

50:43.518 --> 50:44.621
at the time.

50:44.654 --> 50:46.221
You still don't,

50:46.254 --> 50:47.556
for either.

50:47.590 --> 50:51.426
Right now, all you've got is a
similar van turning down the street.

50:51.460 --> 50:53.763
Around the approximate time
Clara Bloom went missing.

50:53.796 --> 50:57.265
But we don't know that
she was even taken in a van.

50:57.299 --> 51:00.535
It takes three minutes to drive
down Chalmers from end to end,

51:00.569 --> 51:02.537
and there's absolutely
nothing on it.

51:02.571 --> 51:05.407
It's just a backroad on the
edge of the zoo's perimeter.

51:05.440 --> 51:09.779
This van turns onto
Chalmers at 11:47.

51:09.812 --> 51:14.383
It doesn't exit
onto Park until 12:31,

51:14.416 --> 51:18.821
which means it was on
Chalmers for 44 minutes.

51:19.956 --> 51:22.324
44 minutes.

51:22.357 --> 51:24.359
It's not that hard
to paint a van.

51:25.293 --> 51:26.495
Okay.

51:27.830 --> 51:30.265
Okay?

51:30.298 --> 51:32.669
- Okay, what?
- Okay, bring me something else.

51:34.503 --> 51:35.404
But I don't need
to remind you

51:35.437 --> 51:37.205
that we're coming up
on three days gone,

51:37.239 --> 51:38.407
so do it fast.

51:41.243 --> 51:42.277
Okay.

51:51.954 --> 51:53.923
What are you gonna do
if he doesn't come back?

52:13.943 --> 52:15.544
Well?

52:18.014 --> 52:19.682
Here.

52:25.021 --> 52:27.023
<i>It's been three days
since Clara Bloom</i>

52:27.056 --> 52:29.025
<i>was last seen
by her family.</i>

52:29.058 --> 52:30.392
<i>The five-year-old
was believed</i>

52:30.425 --> 52:31.728
<i>to have been
on Chalmers Road</i>

52:31.761 --> 52:34.597
<i>near the Como Zoo
with classmates</i>

52:34.630 --> 52:36.766
<i>on a field trip
before she...</i>

52:38.366 --> 52:40.937
So she wasn't here about Mia,
she was here about...

52:40.970 --> 52:42.504
Clara.

52:45.875 --> 52:48.510
- What'd she tell you?
- Not much, just to...

53:38.995 --> 53:40.863
Clara Bloom disappeared
the same night

53:40.897 --> 53:42.899
Stan closed
all his blinds.

53:43.966 --> 53:45.601
This is it?

53:48.503 --> 53:51.874
- Good.
- Good?

53:51.908 --> 53:53.676
No, I don't mean "good."

53:53.709 --> 53:55.945
I mean, now we can
fucking kill him, right?

53:56.946 --> 53:58.981
- No.
- Fuck you mean, no?

54:00.116 --> 54:01.784
They haven't
found a body.

54:01.818 --> 54:03.619
The police
are still looking.

54:03.653 --> 54:06.856
Okay. That don't mean
she's still alive.

54:06.889 --> 54:09.926
That is not a risk
I'm willing to take.

54:09.959 --> 54:12.327
Look, I get it,
all right?

54:13.528 --> 54:15.898
But the truth is,
we don't know shit.

54:15.932 --> 54:17.066
We don't know
this guy's M.O.

54:17.099 --> 54:19.001
I mean, did she
even tell you for sure

54:19.035 --> 54:20.636
what the fucking van's
all about?

54:20.670 --> 54:23.072
No, she just said
she needed to know

54:23.105 --> 54:25.107
if the van
had been painted and,

54:25.141 --> 54:27.076
you know,
I've got to let her...

54:27.109 --> 54:30.112
It's been painted,
and I've got to let her know.

54:30.146 --> 54:31.781
And it has,
and I am going to tell her.

54:31.814 --> 54:32.849
What the fuck
are you doing?

54:35.151 --> 54:36.351
Did you just...

54:40.555 --> 54:41.991
Motherfucker!

54:44.492 --> 54:46.461
That text will send
the fucking cops

54:46.494 --> 54:48.030
through that door
any fucking minute!

54:49.765 --> 54:51.466
Yeah.

54:51.499 --> 54:53.703
Which is why
you should go, Ty.

54:55.570 --> 54:57.073
Look, we're
way off-book,

54:57.106 --> 55:00.142
and there is no reason you
should go down for this with me.

55:00.176 --> 55:04.046
Can you please just go, okay?
Please.

55:12.722 --> 55:14.724
Put your fucking
shit on, dumbass.

55:16.626 --> 55:20.062
- Where is she, huh?
- Where is who?

55:20.096 --> 55:21.496
The missing girl,
fucker!

55:21.529 --> 55:24.066
I don't know what
you're talking about.

55:24.100 --> 55:26.035
Uh-uh.

55:26.068 --> 55:28.570
See that dog ain't
going to hunt no more.

55:28.604 --> 55:30.039
We know you painted
your van.

55:30.072 --> 55:31.774
We know you closed
all your blinds

55:31.807 --> 55:33.609
the same day
she went missing.

55:33.643 --> 55:35.077
Vitamins,
stuffed animals,

55:35.111 --> 55:37.113
the fact that that detective
just knocked on your door,

55:37.146 --> 55:39.481
not to mention what Ryan
said he saw you holding.

55:39.514 --> 55:43.686
You add all that up...
No. No.

55:46.656 --> 55:50.860
Tyler, I can't speak to
what Ryan saw in his grief,

55:50.893 --> 55:52.895
nor would I
presume to.

55:53.763 --> 55:55.865
Now I did
paint my van.

55:55.898 --> 55:58.067
I do it once a year
to prevent rust.

55:58.100 --> 56:00.102
The weather
is very harsh here.

56:00.703 --> 56:02.238
Doing it myself
saves me

56:02.271 --> 56:03.839
from being gouged
by a professional.

56:03.873 --> 56:06.208
As for the rest,
all I can say is

56:06.242 --> 56:07.442
what I've
already said.

56:08.778 --> 56:09.679
I had nothing,

56:09.712 --> 56:12.748
nothing to do with
what happened to Mia,

56:12.782 --> 56:14.250
just like I had
nothing to do

56:14.283 --> 56:17.086
with what happened
to the girl,

56:17.119 --> 56:18.587
the other girl.

56:26.929 --> 56:27.964
Buying any of it?

56:31.033 --> 56:32.467
Help me
get his shoes off then.

56:34.270 --> 56:35.470
Why?

56:37.539 --> 56:39.141
Why?
What are you doing?

56:40.810 --> 56:42.011
You don't
have to do this.

56:44.546 --> 56:45.781
Last chance,
fucker.

56:45.815 --> 56:47.183
Please,
don't do this.

56:47.216 --> 56:49.251
I can't tell you
what I don't know.

56:49.285 --> 56:50.853
I don't know
how many

56:50.886 --> 56:52.955
different ways
I can say that.

56:54.890 --> 56:57.126
- You're full of shit, buddy.
- No. No!

57:27.189 --> 57:28.591
You ready
to talk?

57:28.624 --> 57:30.893
Huh? The girl, fucker!
Where?

57:30.926 --> 57:33.763
- I believe in God...
- Talk! Talk!

57:33.796 --> 57:36.265
- ...the Father Almighty, the creator...
- Fuck you!

57:36.298 --> 57:38.267
- ...of Heaven, the gift of life...
- Fuck you!

57:38.300 --> 57:40.736
- ...and Jesus Christ, His only Son...
- Fuck you, you Bible-thumping...

57:40.770 --> 57:41.871
...piece of shit!

57:41.904 --> 57:43.139
- ...and is seated at the right hand...
- Fuck you...

57:43.172 --> 57:45.941
- ...you fucking piece of shit!
- of the Father, the man who...

57:45.975 --> 57:47.743
- I'll fucking take your teeth out...
- ...and was crucified under...

57:47.777 --> 57:50.846
- ...one at a time!
- ...Pontius Pilate.

57:50.880 --> 57:51.981
- He was crucified and died...
- You fucking piece of shit!

57:52.014 --> 57:53.015
Go.

58:01.924 --> 58:05.961
I meant what I said earlier,
you should just go, Ty.

58:05.995 --> 58:07.163
Fuck you.

58:10.800 --> 58:12.902
- Ty.
- Get the fuck off me!

58:18.174 --> 58:20.575
Look, Ty, you're the toughest
son of a bitch I know, but,

58:22.378 --> 58:24.280
maybe it's like
your mom used to say,

58:24.313 --> 58:27.583
maybe our eyes were
bigger than our stomachs.

58:28.384 --> 58:30.719
We can't fucking
break him,

58:30.753 --> 58:31.987
and we can't
fucking kill him.

58:33.055 --> 58:35.024
Where does
that leave us, huh?

58:35.057 --> 58:36.292
What, we just
sit here and wait

58:36.325 --> 58:37.793
for the cops to come
and cuff us?

58:48.170 --> 58:50.606
Clara's the priority now.

58:51.841 --> 58:55.911
They got dogs
and forensics,

58:55.945 --> 58:58.948
and resources
we don't have.

59:03.752 --> 59:04.920
If you think I'm going
to leave you

59:04.954 --> 59:06.622
holding the bag
on this yourself, man...

59:12.795 --> 59:15.631
I'm sorry.

59:16.832 --> 59:18.901
I'm sorry I dragged
you into this shit.

59:23.439 --> 59:24.974
It ain't
on you, man.

59:25.908 --> 59:28.110
I dragged myself into this
shit, remember?

59:33.916 --> 59:35.317
Look, I just...

59:41.790 --> 59:44.326
Look, I just,
you know, needed to

59:45.861 --> 59:47.997
hear him say it
more than I needed...

59:50.199 --> 59:51.667
I know.

59:56.272 --> 59:58.040
I don't know
what I needed, man.

59:58.073 --> 59:59.675
I just knew
that Mia was...

1:00:01.343 --> 1:00:03.412
You were

1:00:05.080 --> 1:00:06.682
Uncle Ty.

1:00:15.491 --> 1:00:17.793
Right.

1:00:17.826 --> 1:00:20.829
So let's see if Uncle
Ty's got this straight.

1:00:22.164 --> 1:00:23.432
We know
it's him.

1:00:25.367 --> 1:00:27.236
Well, you ain't going
to get no closure.

1:00:28.170 --> 1:00:29.705
We've got
no real proof.

1:00:30.940 --> 1:00:32.841
That other girl might
be alive out there

1:00:32.875 --> 1:00:36.512
somewhere still,
and, uh,

1:00:36.545 --> 1:00:38.013
our only option
is, what,

1:00:38.047 --> 1:00:40.482
just to sit here
and wait

1:00:40.516 --> 1:00:42.251
to see how long our prison
sentence is going to be?

1:00:42.284 --> 1:00:43.352
That about
sum it up?

1:02:47.276 --> 1:02:48.444
No!

1:02:53.583 --> 1:02:55.484
No!

1:02:56.385 --> 1:02:58.420
No!

1:02:59.955 --> 1:03:00.956
Gosh!

1:03:14.203 --> 1:03:15.504
It's okay.

1:03:54.977 --> 1:03:56.512
She's still alive,
isn't she?

1:03:58.247 --> 1:04:00.482
Fuck you!
Fuck you, God damn it!

1:04:00.516 --> 1:04:01.517
Hey! Hey!

1:04:09.258 --> 1:04:12.261
Ryan. Ryan.

1:04:14.062 --> 1:04:15.598
Don't take it personal.

1:04:16.733 --> 1:04:20.436
It's just what
the good Lord wants.

1:04:22.004 --> 1:04:23.405
See,

1:04:23.439 --> 1:04:27.242
we are God's
entertainment,

1:04:27.276 --> 1:04:30.479
his own personal
reality TV show,

1:04:30.512 --> 1:04:34.516
so we need to keep things
interesting for Him.

1:04:36.285 --> 1:04:37.519
It's his mandate.

1:04:38.320 --> 1:04:40.189
Not mine.

1:04:40.222 --> 1:04:43.125
Believe me.

1:04:43.158 --> 1:04:45.160
None of this
is my idea.

1:04:46.228 --> 1:04:50.633
It's just how
He made me.

1:04:52.769 --> 1:04:55.070
And in the end,

1:04:55.103 --> 1:04:58.307
all any of us can do
is our best to serve

1:04:59.174 --> 1:05:02.144
His purposes.

1:05:02.177 --> 1:05:05.280
Is she alive, man?
Just fucking tell us.

1:05:10.419 --> 1:05:14.289
- Fuck.
- No! No!

1:05:14.323 --> 1:05:17.493
I know. I know. I know.

1:05:19.228 --> 1:05:21.631
Just

1:05:21.664 --> 1:05:23.766
don't fall apart on me,
all right?

1:05:23.800 --> 1:05:25.133
Please.

1:05:26.669 --> 1:05:28.638
We got to hold it
together, man.

1:05:28.671 --> 1:05:30.673
We got to hold it
together, okay?

1:05:32.675 --> 1:05:36.245
- We have to call 911.
- I know.

1:05:39.682 --> 1:05:43.252
Look, man.
Hey, hey.

1:05:43.285 --> 1:05:46.288
- We got him.
- Yeah.

1:05:46.823 --> 1:05:49.258
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1:05:49.291 --> 1:05:52.461
This was all you, man.
This was all you, okay?

1:05:52.494 --> 1:05:54.062
So if they do find
that other girl

1:05:54.096 --> 1:05:55.665
alive out there
somewhere,

1:05:56.431 --> 1:05:58.333
who knows?

1:05:58.367 --> 1:06:01.704
- Maybe the judge will go easy on us.
- Yeah.

1:06:03.305 --> 1:06:05.407
Wait, where are you going?
What are you doing?

1:06:05.440 --> 1:06:08.277
I'm going to go take the
plastic down from the walls.

1:06:08.310 --> 1:06:09.679
I think it might look
better when the cops come,

1:06:09.712 --> 1:06:10.780
if it doesn't
look like we had

1:06:10.813 --> 1:06:12.047
a fucking execution
planned.

1:06:20.857 --> 1:06:22.357
Oh, shit.

1:06:28.865 --> 1:06:30.065
Okay.

1:06:34.403 --> 1:06:35.404
All right.

1:06:42.679 --> 1:06:45.414
- I'll take you to her.
- What?

1:06:46.381 --> 1:06:49.752
Clara.
I'll take you to her.

1:06:58.493 --> 1:06:59.762
What now?

1:07:00.897 --> 1:07:04.867
I'll take you to her,
but only you two.

1:07:04.901 --> 1:07:06.234
Asshole, it's fucking over.
The cops...

1:07:06.268 --> 1:07:09.872
They'll never find her,
and if you bring them into this now...

1:07:09.906 --> 1:07:11.373
I promise,
neither will you.

1:07:11.406 --> 1:07:12.507
If you fucking think
for one second that we...

1:07:12.541 --> 1:07:14.777
I want this
to be over.

1:07:19.247 --> 1:07:21.249
The truth is,
I'm tired.

1:07:22.585 --> 1:07:24.219
I knew this day
was going to come,

1:07:24.252 --> 1:07:25.588
and when I woke up
in this chair

1:07:25.622 --> 1:07:27.255
with you two
standing over me,

1:07:28.658 --> 1:07:30.225
I knew that day
was today.

1:07:31.928 --> 1:07:34.664
But if meeting my end
means going to prison,

1:07:35.898 --> 1:07:37.600
then I'm sure
He would rather

1:07:37.634 --> 1:07:40.235
I let Clara die
from dehydration,

1:07:40.268 --> 1:07:42.270
before I tell anyone
where she is.

1:07:44.941 --> 1:07:48.143
Call it a piece
de resistance.

1:07:49.712 --> 1:07:51.513
As for me, the thought
of spending

1:07:51.546 --> 1:07:52.882
years on death row,

1:07:52.915 --> 1:07:54.784
while some
small-minded shrinks

1:07:54.817 --> 1:07:56.451
prod me
with questionnaires,

1:07:56.485 --> 1:07:58.755
like squirrels, trying to make
sense of computer code,

1:08:00.489 --> 1:08:04.159
the thought of that is a
little more than I can bear.

1:08:05.360 --> 1:08:07.429
But I have
no illusions.

1:08:08.463 --> 1:08:09.699
I know
what I've done,

1:08:09.732 --> 1:08:11.634
and I know
what has to happen.

1:08:13.368 --> 1:08:15.470
It's just simply
a matter of a quick

1:08:15.504 --> 1:08:17.272
or a slow death,

1:08:17.305 --> 1:08:18.708
and Tyler,
earlier,

1:08:20.475 --> 1:08:22.679
you offered me a choice
between the two.

1:08:24.513 --> 1:08:26.314
So,

1:08:27.382 --> 1:08:28.651
if I still
have a say,

1:08:28.685 --> 1:08:31.186
I'd like to be the one
to make that choice.

1:08:32.722 --> 1:08:34.657
Did my daughter
have a choice, asshole?

1:08:34.691 --> 1:08:36.592
I'm offering you
Clara Bloom's life

1:08:36.626 --> 1:08:38.527
for the promise
of a quick death.

1:08:39.929 --> 1:08:42.699
Do we have
a deal?

1:08:50.640 --> 1:08:51.908
That asshole's
done nothing

1:08:51.941 --> 1:08:53.408
but fuck with us
from the start!

1:08:53.442 --> 1:08:54.777
Yeah, hold on, hold on,
hold on a second.

1:08:54.811 --> 1:08:57.546
Let's just
take a second.

1:08:57.580 --> 1:08:59.849
Let's just take a step back
and think about this.

1:08:59.882 --> 1:09:01.450
Okay, okay.

1:09:01.483 --> 1:09:04.987
I mean, even if he is
99 percent full of shit,

1:09:05.021 --> 1:09:07.857
do we at least buy that he
is never going to tell anyone

1:09:07.890 --> 1:09:09.992
where Clara is
if we bring the cops in?

1:09:10.026 --> 1:09:13.663
Because if that's true,
then maybe they don't

1:09:13.696 --> 1:09:16.431
have a better shot now
at saving her than we do.

1:09:18.034 --> 1:09:19.836
Maybe calling them
actually

1:09:19.869 --> 1:09:22.237
makes things worse
for Clara.

1:09:49.397 --> 1:09:51.500
You know the second
we smell bullshit,

1:09:51.533 --> 1:09:52.769
we turn you over
to the cops

1:09:52.802 --> 1:09:54.904
with all your
little-ass trophies.

1:09:54.937 --> 1:09:56.271
You know that, right?

1:09:56.806 --> 1:09:57.940
Yeah.

1:10:05.081 --> 1:10:06.414
All right.

1:10:52.394 --> 1:10:54.797
- Where are we going, Stan?
- It's not far.

1:10:56.464 --> 1:10:59.669
So tell me, honestly,
how did I do?

1:11:00.870 --> 1:11:02.038
Emotions
are so tricky.

1:11:02.071 --> 1:11:03.371
But I've had
a lot of practice,

1:11:03.405 --> 1:11:05.608
and I really feel
I hit

1:11:05.641 --> 1:11:06.976
all the right notes

1:11:07.009 --> 1:11:09.645
at the right
moments tonight.

1:11:12.480 --> 1:11:15.017
Clara would've been
my sixth.

1:11:16.418 --> 1:11:18.054
I've killed
five children

1:11:18.087 --> 1:11:20.990
across three states
for Him,

1:11:21.023 --> 1:11:22.058
and I'm sure
the parents

1:11:22.091 --> 1:11:23.926
all probably felt
similar things,

1:11:23.960 --> 1:11:26.361
to what you
experienced, Ryan,

1:11:27.029 --> 1:11:30.132
but the truth is,

1:11:30.166 --> 1:11:32.735
the world never
stops spinning,

1:11:32.768 --> 1:11:34.770
the universe
didn't even blink.

1:11:35.972 --> 1:11:39.675
That's because
good and evil,

1:11:39.709 --> 1:11:42.612
they don't really exist.
They're human concepts.

1:11:42.645 --> 1:11:44.180
Like the offspring
of wild animals

1:11:44.213 --> 1:11:46.616
are killed and die
all the time.

1:11:46.649 --> 1:11:48.084
But when it happens
to people,

1:11:48.117 --> 1:11:50.485
they make
a big deal out of it,

1:11:50.518 --> 1:11:52.855
and that's because
I think

1:11:52.889 --> 1:11:54.422
that we
are fundamentally

1:11:54.456 --> 1:11:58.594
these
self-important beings

1:11:58.628 --> 1:12:01.496
and the irony is,

1:12:01.529 --> 1:12:06.168
there are some serious
problems facing our species.

1:12:06.202 --> 1:12:08.503
I don't think
anyone has an idea.

1:12:08.536 --> 1:12:11.774
I don't think people understand
how close we are

1:12:11.807 --> 1:12:14.409
to our own
extinction event.

1:12:16.212 --> 1:12:18.881
The world had four billion
people in it when I was born.

1:12:18.915 --> 1:12:20.850
Now there are eight,

1:12:20.883 --> 1:12:23.485
eight billion people.

1:12:23.518 --> 1:12:25.154
So, in another
100 years,

1:12:25.187 --> 1:12:27.857
overpopulation
will ensure

1:12:27.890 --> 1:12:31.093
that our planet can no
longer sustain human life.

1:12:33.095 --> 1:12:36.732
Other species will survive
and thrive, of course.

1:12:36.766 --> 1:12:37.934
But we will not.

1:12:38.834 --> 1:12:40.836
And here you are,

1:12:40.870 --> 1:12:43.973
focusing all your attention
on the life,

1:12:44.907 --> 1:12:46.541
of one small child.

1:12:47.777 --> 1:12:49.879
Why?

1:12:49.912 --> 1:12:53.749
Because our brains
were not designed

1:12:53.783 --> 1:12:56.484
to handle problems
that big.

1:12:57.887 --> 1:12:59.889
So, instead,
we focus on the small.

1:12:59.922 --> 1:13:01.757
And that,

1:13:01.791 --> 1:13:03.793
that is
our fatal flaw.

1:13:05.261 --> 1:13:08.064
The bug that He wrote
into our programming,

1:13:08.097 --> 1:13:09.665
to make sure
that we remain

1:13:09.699 --> 1:13:12.134
a flash-in-the-pan
sitcom

1:13:12.168 --> 1:13:14.569
that in the grand
scheme of things.,

1:13:14.603 --> 1:13:17.840
in the grand scheme
of the planet's life,

1:13:17.873 --> 1:13:21.243
will not have even aired
enough episodes

1:13:21.277 --> 1:13:23.478
to make it
into syndication.

1:13:24.613 --> 1:13:25.948
It's sad.

1:13:25.982 --> 1:13:27.482
Sorry, should we be
taking notes?

1:13:28.284 --> 1:13:29.852
I bet you're
pretty popular

1:13:29.885 --> 1:13:31.486
with the ladies,
aren't you, Tyler?

1:13:32.722 --> 1:13:34.090
Which kind of proves
my whole point

1:13:34.123 --> 1:13:37.593
about us being doomed
as a species.

1:13:37.626 --> 1:13:39.161
I cannot wait
to fucking kill you.

1:13:40.262 --> 1:13:42.264
You certainly
have that look.

1:13:43.766 --> 1:13:45.034
I remember
what it was like

1:13:45.067 --> 1:13:47.269
for me
my first time.

1:13:47.303 --> 1:13:51.741
Surprising, though,
how much the conception,

1:13:51.774 --> 1:13:53.776
differs from
the execution.

1:14:42.158 --> 1:14:43.759
What is this place?

1:14:43.793 --> 1:14:47.863
It's a property
I own anonymously.

1:14:47.897 --> 1:14:49.899
You'll find
Clara upstairs.

1:15:07.983 --> 1:15:09.151
After you, Stan.

1:16:07.209 --> 1:16:08.310
Stop.

1:16:17.720 --> 1:16:19.088
There's no one here.

1:16:19.922 --> 1:16:21.056
Uh-huh.

1:16:23.292 --> 1:16:24.293
Go on, then.

1:16:50.419 --> 1:16:52.154
Aren't there
any fucking lights?

1:16:52.188 --> 1:16:55.824
There are in the bedroom.
That's where Clara is.

1:16:57.326 --> 1:16:58.928
Just take it nice and slow,
Stan.

1:17:00.262 --> 1:17:02.131
That's the only
option I have, Tyler.

1:17:02.164 --> 1:17:03.966
Relax. You're the one
with the gun.

1:17:04.833 --> 1:17:06.468
Besides,

1:17:06.502 --> 1:17:09.405
even if my leg were healthy
and my hands weren't tied...

1:17:10.306 --> 1:17:11.774
I still get the sense that

1:17:11.807 --> 1:17:13.175
I'd be no match
for you physically,

1:17:13.209 --> 1:17:15.110
so why so worried?

1:17:19.281 --> 1:17:20.349
Gentlemen...

1:17:21.850 --> 1:17:24.220
why are we really here?

1:17:26.455 --> 1:17:28.057
Did you agree to this deal

1:17:28.090 --> 1:17:32.027
because you truly
want to save Clara?

1:17:32.061 --> 1:17:34.230
Or is it simply because
you want to save yourself

1:17:34.263 --> 1:17:35.764
the consequences...

1:17:36.398 --> 1:17:38.200
of getting revenge for Mia?

1:17:39.935 --> 1:17:42.438
That would make the most sense
since self-preservation...

1:17:44.273 --> 1:17:46.141
that's every being's
prime directive.

1:17:52.948 --> 1:17:55.985
She's the only reason you ain't
in the fucking ground already.

1:17:56.018 --> 1:17:57.219
But keep talking...

1:17:58.287 --> 1:18:00.956
and I'll happily pop a cap
up your ass right now.

1:18:10.366 --> 1:18:11.800
Forgive me.

1:18:11.834 --> 1:18:14.903
Human nature interests me

1:18:14.937 --> 1:18:16.872
and I was always
trying to learn.

1:18:18.440 --> 1:18:21.243
I'm going to turn the lights on.

1:18:21.277 --> 1:18:23.178
Please don't shoot me yet,
Tyler.

1:20:04.614 --> 1:20:06.115
Ahh!

1:20:15.991 --> 1:20:17.159
<i>Get up.</i>

1:20:17.660 --> 1:20:18.961
Get up!

1:22:26.321 --> 1:22:27.389
You okay?

1:22:35.698 --> 1:22:37.032
Oh, shit.

1:22:40.102 --> 1:22:41.303
She's still alive.

1:22:42.772 --> 1:22:44.506
We have to get her
to a hospital.

1:22:45.173 --> 1:22:46.208
Come on.

1:23:13.468 --> 1:23:15.638
Fucking Newgrove.
Kevin Newgrove.

1:23:15.672 --> 1:23:17.239
Kevin-fucking-Newgrove!

1:23:17.272 --> 1:23:18.340
That's who used to live...

1:23:18.373 --> 1:23:19.842
That's who used to live there.

1:23:19.876 --> 1:23:21.611
His sister! I fucked his sister

1:23:21.644 --> 1:23:23.211
in the basement bathroom!

1:23:23.245 --> 1:23:24.614
- Where's the bathroom?
- What?

1:23:24.647 --> 1:23:25.715
Where's the... Take us back.

1:23:25.748 --> 1:23:27.750
- Take us back! Take us back!
- Jesus fucking Christ.

1:23:27.784 --> 1:23:29.586
Jesus, God damn it, Ty!

1:23:29.986 --> 1:23:32.622
I'm fine. Clara.

1:23:44.601 --> 1:23:45.735
Fuck.

1:23:49.204 --> 1:23:50.472
It was right there!

1:24:06.388 --> 1:24:07.690
This is sound-proofing foam.

1:24:07.724 --> 1:24:09.626
Get a hammer! Get something.

1:24:34.784 --> 1:24:36.485
Move! Move! Move!

1:24:48.397 --> 1:24:49.498
She's in there.

1:24:50.532 --> 1:24:52.167
She's in there. Come on.

1:24:56.606 --> 1:24:57.974
Go.

1:24:58.007 --> 1:24:59.307
I'm here.

1:25:45.988 --> 1:25:47.322
Daddy.

1:26:38.440 --> 1:26:39.474
Gentlemen...

1:26:41.611 --> 1:26:43.278
we owe you a debt of gratitude.

1:26:51.654 --> 1:26:53.321
Detective Hammett here
has been telling me

1:26:53.355 --> 1:26:54.891
how you guys basically, um...

1:26:54.924 --> 1:26:58.393
Uh, Lieutenant,
it's been a long night.

1:26:58.426 --> 1:26:59.996
Everything will be
in my report,

1:27:00.029 --> 1:27:01.864
and we can bring
these guys back later

1:27:01.898 --> 1:27:03.065
to give their
official statements...

1:27:03.099 --> 1:27:04.967
but for now, I...

1:27:05.001 --> 1:27:07.569
I'm sure Mr. Olsen
and Mr. Long

1:27:07.603 --> 1:27:10.606
would appreciate it
if we, uh...

1:27:14.043 --> 1:27:15.044
you know...

1:27:16.913 --> 1:27:19.015
Sure.

1:27:19.048 --> 1:27:21.449
We can wait till tomorrow
for you to give your statement.

1:27:22.885 --> 1:27:25.888
God knows we've got enough
to keep us busy.

1:27:25.922 --> 1:27:28.791
Mr. Olsen, Mr. Long,
would you like to come with me?

1:27:28.825 --> 1:27:31.661
- Uh-huh.
- Yes. Yes, we would.

1:27:31.694 --> 1:27:34.063
Hammett, hospital.

1:27:34.096 --> 1:27:35.932
As soon as I get these
guys squared away.

1:27:37.432 --> 1:27:39.568
You two should go
to the hospital, too.

1:27:39.602 --> 1:27:41.804
Mr. Olsen, I will call you
later tonight and tell you

1:27:41.838 --> 1:27:43.973
exactly what I want you
to say to my lieutenant...

1:27:44.006 --> 1:27:46.508
when you two give
your statements, all right?

1:27:47.442 --> 1:27:49.946
Uh... Yeah. Okay.

1:27:49.979 --> 1:27:52.547
And guys,
stay away from the press.

1:27:54.650 --> 1:27:55.718
Sure.

1:28:04.894 --> 1:28:06.028
Jessie.

1:28:07.630 --> 1:28:08.764
Ryan.

1:28:30.485 --> 1:28:31.687
I'm gonna call an Uber.

1:28:31.721 --> 1:28:33.589
- You're coming with us, Ty.
- Okay.

1:29:21.270 --> 1:29:23.973
<i>Two local men
are being celebrated as heroes</i>
