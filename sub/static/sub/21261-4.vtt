WEBVTT

00:01.302 --> 00:04.305
ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen,
tech pioneer Darius Tanz!

00:04.338 --> 00:05.739
LIAM:
Sir, my name's Liam Cole.

00:05.773 --> 00:07.508
In 186 days,
an asteroid's

00:07.541 --> 00:10.111
gonna collide with Earth
and we're all gonna die.

00:10.144 --> 00:12.180
Previously on Salvation...

00:12.213 --> 00:13.181
Jillian?

00:13.214 --> 00:14.315
Liam.

00:14.348 --> 00:15.716
Hey.

00:15.749 --> 00:17.351
The job offer from Darius
is an opportunity.

00:17.385 --> 00:20.254
You should take it.
I already did.

00:20.288 --> 00:22.756
TANZ: What we need is
a working EmDrive we can get

00:22.790 --> 00:24.358
to our asteroid friend here

00:24.392 --> 00:26.127
with just enough time
for a gravity tractor

00:26.160 --> 00:28.462
to save us all
from extinction.

00:28.496 --> 00:31.399
No one has ever
built a working EmDrive.

00:31.432 --> 00:32.600
We can't trust the government.

00:32.633 --> 00:33.634
We have to do
this ourselves.

00:33.667 --> 00:35.469
Uranium,
I know where to get it.

00:35.503 --> 00:37.071
You know that under
normal circumstances,

00:37.105 --> 00:39.340
I would never do some
of the things I've done.

00:39.373 --> 00:40.474
HARRIS: You've made
your choices, Grace.

00:40.508 --> 00:41.842
Now I need to make mine.

00:41.875 --> 00:42.943
The IO Probe.

00:42.976 --> 00:45.613
The plan would be to redirect it
from Jupiter's orbit

00:45.646 --> 00:47.415
and propel it into the asteroid.

00:47.448 --> 00:49.150
HARRIS: You have an issue
with this plan?

00:49.183 --> 00:51.219
Yes. In a word, it stinks.

00:51.252 --> 00:52.786
That high-velocity
kinetic impact

00:52.820 --> 00:54.222
could smash our
asteroid friend

00:54.255 --> 00:55.589
into several pieces,

00:55.623 --> 00:58.559
each of which may cause
cataclysmic damage.

00:58.592 --> 01:00.661
But they will
land somewhere.

01:00.694 --> 01:02.330
Yes, Russia, China.

01:06.634 --> 01:08.436
NASA TECH:
Sir, we have a problem.
(alarm beeping)

01:08.469 --> 01:10.138
The probe is no longer
responding to us.

01:10.171 --> 01:11.772
STRAUSS: We've been hacked.
NASA has been hacked.

01:11.805 --> 01:13.141
Darius, where are you?

01:13.174 --> 01:15.409
I need to know what you did.

01:16.677 --> 01:18.646
AUCTIONEER:
$750, $750.

01:18.679 --> 01:19.680
Do I hear $800

01:19.713 --> 01:23.417
for this remarkable
neo-classical petite commode?

01:23.451 --> 01:25.453
The last toilet used
by Louis XVI

01:25.486 --> 01:28.222
before he went
to the guillotine.

01:28.256 --> 01:29.823
$800. Do I hear $850?

01:29.857 --> 01:31.259
$850? No, $800.

01:31.292 --> 01:32.426
$800 once, twice...

01:32.460 --> 01:33.561
(gavel bangs)
Sold!

01:33.594 --> 01:34.762
For $800,000

01:34.795 --> 01:37.131
to the gentlewoman
in blue Chanel.

01:37.165 --> 01:39.467
Up next, today's premier item.

01:39.500 --> 01:41.335
Lot 29.

01:41.369 --> 01:43.871
George Washington's
personal copy

01:43.904 --> 01:45.473
of the Bill of Rights.

01:45.506 --> 01:47.908
Signed by
our first president,

01:47.941 --> 01:51.212
this is quite possibly
the most important document

01:51.245 --> 01:53.281
that the auction world has seen.

01:53.314 --> 01:55.849
Bidding will start
at $5 million.

01:55.883 --> 01:58.552
And I have $5 million
from Mr. Tanz.

01:58.586 --> 01:59.920
Thank you. Do I hear 5.5?

01:59.953 --> 02:01.722
Do I hear six?

02:01.755 --> 02:03.557
Do I hear six?
Six from the phone bank.

02:03.591 --> 02:05.693
6.5 from an online buyer.

02:05.726 --> 02:08.429
$7 million.
$7 million from Mr. Tanz.

02:08.462 --> 02:11.565
$7.5 million
from Mr. Bloomberg.

02:11.599 --> 02:12.633
Do I hear eight? Eight?

02:12.666 --> 02:14.468
Eight from Mr. Tanz. Thank you.
(phone vibrating)

02:14.502 --> 02:16.437
8.5 from Mr. Bloomberg.

02:16.470 --> 02:18.706
And back to Mr. Tanz
for $9 million.

02:18.739 --> 02:19.740
9.5.

02:22.776 --> 02:25.179
(line ringing)

02:25.213 --> 02:26.480
Pick up.

02:26.514 --> 02:27.681
(frustrated grunt)

02:27.715 --> 02:29.550
HARRIS:
Make no mistake, we are at war.

02:29.583 --> 02:32.586
A war we have 12 hours
to win, people.

02:32.620 --> 02:34.422
NASA's been hacked.

02:34.455 --> 02:37.458
The EmDrive's not viable,
so this is it--

02:37.491 --> 02:39.560
us against whomever hacked
the IO Space Probe.

02:39.593 --> 02:42.596
If we don't regain control
by then, it goes into free fall,

02:42.630 --> 02:44.332
and we will lose it forever,

02:44.365 --> 02:46.867
along with our best hope
of stopping this thing.

02:46.900 --> 02:49.370
That cannot happen.

03:00.881 --> 03:03.217
Can't sleep?

03:03.251 --> 03:05.486
No, not so much.

03:05.519 --> 03:07.521
Me, either.

03:07.555 --> 03:08.922
First-day jitters.

03:08.956 --> 03:11.625
What? You are going
to be great.

03:11.659 --> 03:12.893
Thank you.

03:12.926 --> 03:15.229
Me, on the
other hand...

03:15.263 --> 03:17.565
(exhales)

03:17.598 --> 03:18.632
Mm.

03:18.666 --> 03:20.301
Hey.

03:22.403 --> 03:24.838
I'm sorry your EmDrive
project didn't go well,

03:24.872 --> 03:26.440
but it was just a test.

03:26.474 --> 03:27.741
I'm sure next
time will...

03:27.775 --> 03:30.911
No, I don't think
there's gonna be a next time.

03:30.944 --> 03:33.414
When you're passionate
about something,

03:33.447 --> 03:35.416
time means nothing.

03:35.449 --> 03:37.451
Who said that?

03:37.485 --> 03:38.486
You did.

03:38.519 --> 03:39.520
(chuckles)

03:40.788 --> 03:42.623
The night we met.

03:44.925 --> 03:46.894
Hey, how old was Isaac Newton

03:46.927 --> 03:48.896
when that apple
bonked him on his head

03:48.929 --> 03:51.299
and he came up with
the theory of gravity?

03:51.332 --> 03:53.567
He was 23.

03:53.601 --> 03:54.802
Hmm.

03:54.835 --> 03:57.004
But it took him 20 more years
to prove it.

03:57.037 --> 03:59.373
Well, I have faith in you.

03:59.407 --> 04:00.841
You'll crack it.

04:00.874 --> 04:02.810
(whispers):
I know it.

04:15.656 --> 04:17.291
(sighs)

04:17.325 --> 04:18.792
CLAIRE: Any progress
from counterintelligence?

04:18.826 --> 04:21.662
Even a shred of hope
I can pass along to POTUS?

04:21.695 --> 04:22.730
We're working on it.

04:22.763 --> 04:24.064
Whoever hacked IO
was no amateur.

04:24.097 --> 04:25.633
Well, right now
we seem like the amateurs.

04:25.666 --> 04:27.701
We have three government
agencies in this room,

04:27.735 --> 04:29.703
supposedly the best of the best.

04:29.737 --> 04:32.473
Prove it.
Find whoever did this, now.

04:38.412 --> 04:39.847
Give us the room.

04:41.982 --> 04:43.817
Where is he?

04:43.851 --> 04:45.819
I don't know.
He hasn't responded.

04:45.853 --> 04:47.388
So Darius Tanz
just happened to disappear

04:47.421 --> 04:48.789
when all hell broke loose
last night?

04:48.822 --> 04:50.791
Did he give you
any indication

04:50.824 --> 04:52.326
that he was planning
something like this?

04:52.360 --> 04:54.595
Grace, I know there's
not a lot of trust

04:54.628 --> 04:58.466
between us right now, but this
is not the time to hold back.

04:58.499 --> 05:00.601
He sent me this text last night.

05:00.634 --> 05:02.570
I don't know
what it means.

05:13.647 --> 05:14.982
LIAM:
Don't be nervous.

05:15.015 --> 05:16.950
Too late.

05:18.686 --> 05:20.488
But I could use
a little pep talk.

05:20.521 --> 05:24.057
Okay. Okay.

05:24.091 --> 05:25.493
You see these?

05:25.526 --> 05:26.660
Meteorites.

05:26.694 --> 05:28.429
Darius's
coveted collection.

05:28.462 --> 05:31.765
Rare rocks from outer space.

05:31.799 --> 05:34.702
And that beautiful,
shimmering guy there--

05:34.735 --> 05:38.772
that's from the Khatyrka meteor
that fell in Siberia in 2011.

05:38.806 --> 05:40.441
It's a quasicrystal

05:40.474 --> 05:43.043
with fivefold symmetry
called icosahedrite.

05:43.076 --> 05:44.512
Meaning?

05:44.545 --> 05:46.714
It is the only known object
in the universe

05:46.747 --> 05:48.048
with that symmetry.

05:48.081 --> 05:50.651
Nothing like it
exists on Earth.

05:50.684 --> 05:53.086
Shimmering.
One of a kind.

05:53.120 --> 05:54.087
Like you.

05:55.456 --> 05:57.391
Damn, you're good.

05:57.425 --> 05:59.927
You got this.

05:59.960 --> 06:02.396
Yeah.

06:04.164 --> 06:07.801
MAN (over P.A.): Security,
please report to the lobby.

06:07.835 --> 06:10.971
Security, please report
to the lobby.

06:11.004 --> 06:12.773
Don't make me
ask you this again.

06:12.806 --> 06:14.775
Where is he?
All due respect, sir,

06:14.808 --> 06:16.877
Mr. Tanz doesn't permit me
to give out his schedule.

06:16.910 --> 06:18.679
Okay, nothing's private as far
as the Patriot Act's concerned.

06:18.712 --> 06:20.514
So with as much respect

06:20.548 --> 06:23.016
as I can muster,
you will tell me where he is.

06:24.518 --> 06:26.520
Search the building.

06:27.821 --> 06:29.189
And pull all
the hard drives.

06:29.222 --> 06:31.559
LIAM:
What?

06:31.592 --> 06:33.060
What? When?

06:33.093 --> 06:34.895
A few hours ago.

06:34.928 --> 06:36.564
Holy hell.

06:36.597 --> 06:37.765
Where is he?
I don't know.

06:37.798 --> 06:39.032
I haven't seen him
since the EmDrive

06:39.066 --> 06:40.768
crashed and burned.

06:40.801 --> 06:42.570
Do you think Darius
could have hacked NASA?

06:42.603 --> 06:43.737
Could he or-or would he?

06:43.771 --> 06:45.072
Those are two
different questions.

06:45.105 --> 06:47.007
Has he been acting
strange lately?

06:47.040 --> 06:48.542
He's Darius--
he always acts strange.

06:48.576 --> 06:50.143
Do you trust him?

06:53.013 --> 06:54.882
(whispers):
Oh, my...

06:56.750 --> 06:58.552
Liam, where's the uranium?

07:00.253 --> 07:02.590
The barrels of uranium
for the EmDrive.

07:02.623 --> 07:05.459
The EmDrive
doesn't need uranium.

07:05.493 --> 07:06.794
What?

07:08.496 --> 07:10.598
What did he do with it?

07:10.631 --> 07:11.765
TANZ:
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

07:11.799 --> 07:13.834
That document survived
the War of 1812.

07:13.867 --> 07:15.469
It better survive
the ride back to my office.

07:15.503 --> 07:17.738
My oldest friend went to
New York, and all I got

07:17.771 --> 07:19.973
was this lousy copy
of the Bill of Rights.

07:20.007 --> 07:21.875
You should have seen the look
on Bloomberg's face

07:21.909 --> 07:23.176
when he dropped out
at 20 mil.

07:26.680 --> 07:28.649
(tires screeching)

07:35.523 --> 07:36.890
Harris, this is
some welcome home party.

07:36.924 --> 07:39.026
I'm touched.
What's the occasion?

07:39.059 --> 07:41.595
Darius Tanz, you're under arrest
on suspicion of high treason

07:41.629 --> 07:42.930
against the United
States of America.

07:42.963 --> 07:45.198
High treason? I'm not
the one who's high here.

07:45.232 --> 07:47.067
Take him.

07:54.575 --> 07:56.577
*

08:08.088 --> 08:09.657
TANZ:
No lawyer,

08:09.690 --> 08:11.291
no Miranda, no water.

08:11.324 --> 08:13.627
You really know how
to make a guy feel welcome.

08:13.661 --> 08:15.262
Darius, we have ten hours
to get the probe back online.

08:15.295 --> 08:16.930
This is no joke.

08:16.964 --> 08:19.567
If you have an alibi, now would
be the time to speak up.

08:19.600 --> 08:22.570
I'm not a dog.
I don't bark on command.

08:22.603 --> 08:24.972
Six foreign corporations
have sued you

08:25.005 --> 08:26.607
for industrial espionage.

08:26.640 --> 08:28.676
Hacking proprietary technology.

08:28.709 --> 08:30.678
If you know that,
you'd also know I countersued,

08:30.711 --> 08:31.779
because those companies

08:31.812 --> 08:33.614
stole from me.

08:33.647 --> 08:36.016
The drives we took from Tanz
this morning were wiped clean.

08:36.049 --> 08:38.886
That's fairly incriminating,
don't you think?

08:38.919 --> 08:40.788
They have an
automatic kill switch.

08:40.821 --> 08:43.323
Just smart tech designed
to prevent espionage.

08:43.356 --> 08:45.659
You're wasting time--
time you don't have.

08:45.693 --> 08:47.595
You have the wrong man!
Do I?!

08:53.233 --> 08:55.002
"It's not over.

08:55.035 --> 08:57.037
I have
one more move left."

08:58.639 --> 09:02.209
What did you mean by that
when you texted Grace Barrows?

09:02.242 --> 09:04.645
Hacking NASA?

09:04.678 --> 09:05.913
That was your move,

09:05.946 --> 09:07.280
wasn't it?

09:09.650 --> 09:11.652
Amazing how quickly
people are willing

09:11.685 --> 09:14.688
to believe the
worst about others.

09:17.257 --> 09:18.726
Narcissists.

09:18.759 --> 09:20.661
When they fail,
first they deny it,

09:20.694 --> 09:22.730
then they make sure
no one else succeeds.

09:24.632 --> 09:28.001
Darius, I suggest you talk

09:28.035 --> 09:29.870
while you still
have the ability.

09:29.903 --> 09:31.605
Never seen him
like this, have you?

09:31.639 --> 09:32.873
No.

09:32.906 --> 09:36.276
Funny how men can be
one thing in the bedroom

09:36.309 --> 09:38.578
and another in
the boardroom.

09:40.413 --> 09:42.282
I don't think
that's just men.

09:43.851 --> 09:45.152
We've got something.

09:45.185 --> 09:47.988
The deputy secretary is
gonna want to see this.

09:48.021 --> 09:49.256
LIAM: He told me
to jack up the power.

09:49.289 --> 09:51.625
That's what made this mess.

09:51.659 --> 09:55.395
Do you think Darius did it,
that's he's a...

09:55.428 --> 09:57.030
that he's a traitor?

09:57.064 --> 09:59.366
I don't know.

09:59.399 --> 10:01.902
Oh, I'm sorry.
I should have...

10:01.935 --> 10:03.871
I should have listened
to you, not-not him.

10:03.904 --> 10:05.405
No, no, according
to these readouts,

10:05.438 --> 10:07.374
the drive was gonna
fail anyway.

10:07.407 --> 10:09.042
The microwaves were
going out of alignment

10:09.076 --> 10:10.310
even before you
dialed it up.

10:10.343 --> 10:12.746
Why? What was causing
the electrical turbulence?

10:12.780 --> 10:14.848
Well, that's the billion
dollar question.

10:14.882 --> 10:17.050
We've got to do a forensic
analysis on the body

10:17.084 --> 10:19.019
and figure out what
killed the patient.

10:19.052 --> 10:20.420
We have to reconstruct that?

10:20.453 --> 10:22.189
It looks like
a charred marshmallow,

10:22.222 --> 10:24.357
like a s'more
no one wants to eat.

10:24.391 --> 10:26.994
Well, I already ordered a
prototype from engineering.

10:27.027 --> 10:28.796
Maybe the 180th
will be the charm.

10:28.829 --> 10:31.064
You do realize most scientists
go their entire lives

10:31.098 --> 10:34.201
without that single
lightbulb moment.

10:34.234 --> 10:35.335
The only real failures
are the ones

10:35.368 --> 10:36.670
from which we learn nothing,
Mr. Cole.

10:36.704 --> 10:38.338
Have faith.

10:38.371 --> 10:40.440
If not in Darius Tanz,
then in us.

10:40.473 --> 10:41.775
Yeah.

10:49.082 --> 10:50.784
What if all this,

10:50.818 --> 10:52.452
everything we're doing here,
was just a misdirect

10:52.485 --> 10:54.988
so that Darius can prepare
for his real plan?

10:57.390 --> 10:59.359
And what plan would that be?

10:59.392 --> 11:01.695
MASON:
One...

11:01.729 --> 11:03.396
sixty.

11:05.999 --> 11:07.434
160.

11:07.467 --> 11:10.704
Why is this number so important
to the task at hand?

11:10.738 --> 11:14.241
Let's hear from our newbie,
Jillian Hayes,

11:14.274 --> 11:17.010
a sci-fi writer
from Massachusetts.

11:17.044 --> 11:18.045
Harvard?

11:18.078 --> 11:19.112
MIT?

11:19.146 --> 11:21.114
Boston.

11:21.148 --> 11:23.250
Just Boston.

11:23.283 --> 11:26.019
Jillian from "Just Boston."
Glad to have you here with us.

11:26.053 --> 11:27.454
Where might we have
seen your work?

11:27.487 --> 11:28.922
Where have you
been published?

11:28.956 --> 11:30.290
Self-published.

11:30.323 --> 11:31.391
But hard copies

11:31.424 --> 11:33.126
of my novel ShadowSide

11:33.160 --> 11:34.928
can be found
in some independent bookstores

11:34.962 --> 11:36.396
in the New England area.

11:36.429 --> 11:37.898
Family-owned businesses,

11:37.931 --> 11:39.733
where they give you
a free bookmark

11:39.767 --> 11:41.368
with every purchase.

11:41.401 --> 11:42.469
(quiet laughter)

11:42.502 --> 11:45.338
And what does
the acclaimed author

11:45.372 --> 11:49.743
of ShadowSide have to say
about the number 160?

11:49.777 --> 11:51.078
Well, according
to Darius's algorithms,

11:51.111 --> 11:53.046
it's the minimum number
of humans

11:53.080 --> 11:55.215
required to reboot our species.
Exactly.

11:55.248 --> 11:57.150
So if we had the chance

11:57.184 --> 11:59.052
to repopulate the human species,

11:59.086 --> 12:01.021
starting over
on a terraformed Mars,

12:01.054 --> 12:04.792
who would we bring along?

12:04.825 --> 12:06.760
How do we cull
the vulgus herd

12:06.794 --> 12:12.833
of seven billion
down to an elite 160?

12:12.866 --> 12:14.968
Now, this is not the same
conundrum that Noah faced

12:15.002 --> 12:16.303
when he built his ark,

12:16.336 --> 12:18.438
because he had God
telling him what to do.

12:18.471 --> 12:20.273
And we don't have
God giving us orders.

12:20.307 --> 12:22.175
But like Noah's quest,

12:22.209 --> 12:25.846
this project
is not just an exercise.

12:25.879 --> 12:27.848
In the coming months, we--

12:27.881 --> 12:30.951
the intellectuals,
academics, scientists

12:30.984 --> 12:33.486
and our writer-- have been
tasked by Darius Tanz

12:33.520 --> 12:38.025
to select 160 people...
to colonize Mars.

12:41.962 --> 12:44.197
Counterintelligence successfully
traced the source of the hack.

12:44.231 --> 12:46.800
They call it a mimic signal.

12:46.834 --> 12:49.102
A sat signal that
piggybacks alongside

12:49.136 --> 12:50.938
a proprietary feed,
then overrides it.

12:50.971 --> 12:52.806
That signal was traced
to this dish...

12:55.442 --> 12:57.244
...at Tanz Industries.

13:02.883 --> 13:04.351
Nine hours.

13:04.384 --> 13:06.219
That's all we have left.

13:06.253 --> 13:07.955
Harris.

13:07.988 --> 13:11.258
It's time...
to call in a specialist.

13:13.393 --> 13:15.195
I'll handle it.

13:15.228 --> 13:17.364
(quietly):
All right.

13:17.397 --> 13:19.499
A "specialist"?

13:19.532 --> 13:21.034
Enhanced interrogation?

13:21.068 --> 13:22.469
This is Darius Tanz
we're talking about.

13:22.502 --> 13:24.471
He's guilty, Grace.

13:24.504 --> 13:26.273
The evidence
is not circumstantial.

13:26.306 --> 13:27.975
Why are you
protecting him?

13:28.008 --> 13:30.243
It's not him I'm protecting,
it's our sense of decency.

13:30.277 --> 13:31.478
You're talking
about torture, Harris.

13:31.511 --> 13:32.512
What good is trying
to save humanity

13:32.545 --> 13:34.481
if we lose ours in the process?

13:34.514 --> 13:37.117
In a few hours, we may lose
our last chance at survival.

13:37.150 --> 13:39.987
Losing my humanity
is a high-class problem.

13:40.020 --> 13:42.355
Darius says he's ready to talk.

13:42.389 --> 13:44.992
Finally.
Not to you.

13:45.025 --> 13:46.393
To her.

13:55.402 --> 13:57.370
Grace Barrows.

13:57.404 --> 13:58.872
High time the accused

13:58.906 --> 14:00.040
faced the accuser.

14:00.073 --> 14:02.042
Okay.

14:02.075 --> 14:04.377
You said you'd talk to me,
so talk.

14:04.411 --> 14:05.979
Why did you do this?

14:06.013 --> 14:08.481
To beat that dead horse again,
I didn't.

14:08.515 --> 14:09.582
Darius, they're gonna
bring someone in.

14:09.616 --> 14:10.617
Doesn't that scare you?

14:10.650 --> 14:12.619
Not as much as it scares you.

14:12.652 --> 14:13.853
Me?

14:13.887 --> 14:17.224
Other than the world ending,
what do I have to be afraid of?

14:17.257 --> 14:19.292
Of yourself, discovering
you're capable of things

14:19.326 --> 14:21.161
you couldn't have imagined
a few weeks ago.

14:21.194 --> 14:23.263
You mean like trusting someone

14:23.296 --> 14:25.999
who turned out to be a liar
and a traitor?

14:27.434 --> 14:30.303
I know the uranium
wasn't for the EmDrive.

14:32.339 --> 14:34.307
I never move a piece
on the board

14:34.341 --> 14:36.543
unless it's for a good reason.

14:36.576 --> 14:39.479
I'm not a pawn you can
sacrifice; this isn't a game.

14:40.580 --> 14:42.549
I didn't do this, Grace.

14:42.582 --> 14:44.417
What reason would I have?

14:44.451 --> 14:45.652
Only you can answer that.

14:45.685 --> 14:47.320
Counterintelligence confirmed

14:47.354 --> 14:49.022
the hack came from
Tanz Industries.

14:49.056 --> 14:51.058
(chuckles)

14:51.091 --> 14:53.193
Now who's lying?

14:53.226 --> 14:54.327
Our analysts found
a mimic signal

14:54.361 --> 14:56.396
and traced it back
to a dish at Tanz.

14:56.429 --> 14:58.165
Now an interrogation expert
is on his way

14:58.198 --> 14:59.933
from Langley,
so I suggest you start talking,

14:59.967 --> 15:01.101
because right now,

15:01.134 --> 15:02.702
the only thing
between you

15:02.735 --> 15:05.472
and waterboarding is me.

15:05.505 --> 15:07.607
Grace, if what you're saying
is the truth,

15:07.640 --> 15:09.943
then there's a mole
at Tanz Industries.

15:09.977 --> 15:11.478
Innocent people provide alibis.

15:11.511 --> 15:14.214
I would if I could, but if
there's a mole at Tanz,

15:14.247 --> 15:15.615
people are in danger-- Grace!

15:15.648 --> 15:18.251
I need you to find out
who it is.

15:18.285 --> 15:20.120
Find salvation.

15:38.638 --> 15:40.273
TESS (automated voice):
Hello, Darius.

15:40.307 --> 15:42.309
(electronic chime)

15:48.348 --> 15:49.749
(electronic chime)

15:49.782 --> 15:51.518
TESS:
Good-bye, Darius.

15:58.391 --> 16:00.393
TESS:
Hello, Darius.

16:04.697 --> 16:07.200
What the hell?

16:11.338 --> 16:13.406
I need you to find out
who it is.

16:13.440 --> 16:15.308
Find salvation.

16:31.724 --> 16:34.427
LAZLO:
How'd you do that?

16:34.461 --> 16:36.196
Do what?
Get through the entry gate.

16:36.229 --> 16:38.098
That door,
it thinks you're Darius.

16:38.131 --> 16:39.032
"It"?

16:39.066 --> 16:40.567
Tess. Our A.I. system.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.602
Uh, I don't know.

16:42.635 --> 16:44.504
Where is he? Darius?

16:44.537 --> 16:46.173
He's being questioned.

16:46.206 --> 16:47.574
He asked me to find Liam.

16:47.607 --> 16:49.576
Well, if Mr. Tanz
needs a message delivered,

16:49.609 --> 16:50.743
I'll pass it along.

16:50.777 --> 16:52.579
This is official business.

16:52.612 --> 16:54.414
Anyway, you must have
your hands full

16:54.447 --> 16:55.748
with this wonky A.I. system.

16:55.782 --> 16:57.217
I'll find him.

16:59.519 --> 17:00.787
TESS:
Hello, Darius.

17:00.820 --> 17:02.622
HARRIS:
Any news from analytics?

17:02.655 --> 17:05.625
Their fastest computing
cluster estimates it'll take

17:05.658 --> 17:08.228
approximately 52 hours
to break encryption,

17:08.261 --> 17:10.197
but they're trying to
get that number down.

17:10.230 --> 17:11.664
Damn it. All right.

17:11.698 --> 17:12.799
Well, keep me posted.

17:12.832 --> 17:14.067
CLAIRE:
Okay.

17:14.101 --> 17:16.035
Time to take off the gloves.

17:23.210 --> 17:24.477
Harris.

17:24.511 --> 17:26.779
You aren't culpable
for what's about to happen.

17:26.813 --> 17:28.781
The way POTUS sees it,
we're low on time

17:28.815 --> 17:30.117
and out of options.

17:30.150 --> 17:31.451
MASON:
Playing God.

17:31.484 --> 17:33.386
Picking the 160.

17:33.420 --> 17:36.823
What do we look for
behind these anonymous faces?

17:36.856 --> 17:38.125
We know what's critical.

17:38.158 --> 17:39.259
High IQs,

17:39.292 --> 17:40.860
genetic health, fertility,

17:40.893 --> 17:42.061
skill sets, but...

17:42.095 --> 17:44.431
what do we prioritize?
JILLIAN:
Well, what about artists?

17:44.464 --> 17:47.234
Musicians, poets.

17:47.267 --> 17:49.202
Do they have a place?

17:49.236 --> 17:52.705
Can Picasso fix an engine?

17:52.739 --> 17:54.707
Can Bono birth a baby?

17:54.741 --> 17:59.179
Yeah, I understand the necessity
of utilitarian selection.

17:59.212 --> 18:02.182
But in order to repopulate
our species on Mars,

18:02.215 --> 18:05.885
don't we want to save
the best of what makes us human?

18:05.918 --> 18:08.421
If we didn't
have storytellers

18:08.455 --> 18:12.259
in caves drawing pictographs
on walls,

18:12.292 --> 18:13.260
where would we be today?

18:13.293 --> 18:14.661
You can't paint if you're dead.

18:14.694 --> 18:17.397
Have you read Andre
Bartok's The 360?

18:17.430 --> 18:18.498
Of course.

18:18.531 --> 18:20.800
Two ships manage
to escape a dying Earth

18:20.833 --> 18:23.270
only to encounter
an alien vessel.

18:23.303 --> 18:25.805
Some passengers want to attack,
others want to make contact.

18:25.838 --> 18:28.908
And those who made contact were
the so-called creative types.

18:28.941 --> 18:30.577
Or "non-essentials,"

18:30.610 --> 18:32.412
as Bartok calls them.

18:32.445 --> 18:34.781
They left themselves defenseless
trying to make friends.

18:34.814 --> 18:35.948
And got everyone killed.
It's fiction.

18:35.982 --> 18:38.418
MAN: No, it's a spot-on
assessment of the human race.

18:38.451 --> 18:41.188
The pragmatic are the strong,
the strong survive.

18:42.722 --> 18:45.258
Andre Bartok is
weak, selfish and cruel.

18:45.292 --> 18:46.859
The ravings
of that cynical lunatic

18:46.893 --> 18:48.428
should hardly be our Bible.

18:48.461 --> 18:50.563
(pen clatters)

18:50.597 --> 18:52.432
Maybe we should take a break.

19:06.846 --> 19:08.515
Give me a minute.

19:08.548 --> 19:10.883
We don't have time for a minute.

19:11.918 --> 19:14.387
I made a total
ass of myself.

19:14.421 --> 19:16.223
Don't beat yourself up about it.

19:16.256 --> 19:20.593
All right? The guy sounds
like a total jerk.

19:20.627 --> 19:22.929
What am I
doing here, Liam?

19:22.962 --> 19:24.731
These people
are Harvard academics

19:24.764 --> 19:26.799
and MIT science whizzes,

19:26.833 --> 19:29.502
and I'm just
a self-published nobody.

19:30.870 --> 19:34.741
All I know is Darius has
a reason for everything.

19:34.774 --> 19:37.977
And if you're here, it's
'cause he sees something in you

19:38.010 --> 19:39.979
that the others can't see.

19:40.012 --> 19:41.514
Yet.

19:41.548 --> 19:43.683
Thank you.

19:43.716 --> 19:46.886
Is there any way that
we could go for dinner tonight?

19:46.919 --> 19:49.789
You and me?

19:49.822 --> 19:51.358
(exhales)
Come on.

19:51.391 --> 19:54.294
If you take one night off,
it's not the end of the world.

19:54.327 --> 19:56.463
GRACE:
Liam?

19:56.496 --> 19:57.330
There you are.

19:57.364 --> 19:59.932
Grace, this is, this
is Jillian Hayes.

19:59.966 --> 20:02.335
Hi. We need to talk.

20:02.369 --> 20:03.436
Now.

20:03.470 --> 20:04.804
Yeah. Okay.

20:04.837 --> 20:06.473
I'm sorry.

20:06.506 --> 20:07.440
It's fine. Go.

20:09.676 --> 20:11.544
We don't have a lot of time.

20:11.578 --> 20:14.481
Do you have any idea
what this is?

20:15.448 --> 20:17.884
This is near-field comm tech.

20:17.917 --> 20:19.719
It's the kind of RFID implant

20:19.752 --> 20:23.356
the super rich put in their
bodies for security purposes,

20:23.390 --> 20:25.692
or just to show off.

20:25.725 --> 20:28.027
Got it.

20:28.060 --> 20:29.529
This one's GPS-equipped--
it starts cars,

20:29.562 --> 20:31.331
logs movements.
Unlocks doors.

20:31.364 --> 20:32.999
Which explains
how he got up here.

20:33.032 --> 20:35.435
And you're sure
the hack signal came from here?

20:35.468 --> 20:37.504
Yes.
So Darius is a modern-day Nero

20:37.537 --> 20:39.606
bent on watching the Earth burn?

20:39.639 --> 20:41.874
Or someone else is Nero
and Darius is just the fall guy.

20:41.908 --> 20:42.909
Why give me that?

20:42.942 --> 20:44.277
He wants you to
find something

20:44.311 --> 20:45.878
only he has access to.

20:47.780 --> 20:50.350
You said it logs movements.

20:50.383 --> 20:51.918
Can it tell us
where Darius was

20:51.951 --> 20:53.653
the exact moment
the probe was hacked?

20:53.686 --> 20:58.391
Well, it's a... digital diary,
so it-it should, yeah.

20:58.425 --> 21:00.527
Last night,
between 11:30 and 11:40.

21:02.795 --> 21:05.665
He was on the grounds,
about a kilometer from here.

21:05.698 --> 21:06.766
What's out there?

21:06.799 --> 21:07.934
Nothing.

21:09.736 --> 21:11.738
*

21:35.428 --> 21:38.431
So it's 15 meters
this way.

21:45.505 --> 21:48.908
No X, but this
is the spot.

21:48.941 --> 21:51.944
Keep looking.
There's got to be something.

21:51.978 --> 21:53.980
Just more of Darius's
sleight of hand.

21:56.916 --> 21:58.518
Unless...

22:15.535 --> 22:17.103
TESS:
Hello, Darius.

22:19.105 --> 22:20.807
Ladies first.

22:21.941 --> 22:23.943
Thanks.

22:38.891 --> 22:41.127
You have any idea
where we are?

22:41.160 --> 22:43.830
Other than 100 meters
below ground, no.

22:50.903 --> 22:52.905
(echoing):
Hello?

23:02.114 --> 23:04.150
TESS:
Hello, Darius.

23:18.765 --> 23:20.733
GRACE:
This is it.

23:22.735 --> 23:24.737
Salvation.

23:34.647 --> 23:36.616
LIAM: He doesn't want
to save the planet.

23:36.649 --> 23:38.150
He wants to leave
and play space king.

23:38.184 --> 23:39.819
We've been, we've
been conned.

23:47.093 --> 23:49.862
A Gutenberg Bible.

23:53.900 --> 23:55.902
Van Gogh's Starry Night.

23:58.571 --> 24:00.973
Shakespeare's First Folio.

24:03.510 --> 24:05.512
Beethoven's Ninth.

24:10.550 --> 24:12.519
That's an original copy
of the Bill of Rights.

24:14.220 --> 24:17.524
Why would someone
who wants to doom humanity

24:17.557 --> 24:19.191
also save its greatest works?

24:19.225 --> 24:21.227
It doesn't make sense.

24:25.197 --> 24:28.167
He wanted me to find Salvation.

24:28.200 --> 24:30.202
Why?

24:32.204 --> 24:34.907
Hey, let me
see your phone.

24:34.941 --> 24:37.644
Can I see your phone?

24:40.847 --> 24:42.248
What?

24:49.589 --> 24:51.057
This hangar--

24:51.090 --> 24:52.925
this entire facility--
it's air gapped.

24:52.959 --> 24:54.894
It's cut off from
the rest of the world.

24:54.927 --> 24:57.096
You... you can't
send a text,

24:57.129 --> 24:58.698
access the Net,
make a call.

24:58.731 --> 25:00.667
If he was here when
the probe was hacked...

25:00.700 --> 25:04.136
A hack NASA said had to occur
live and in real-time.

25:04.170 --> 25:05.905
Liam, there's no way
he could've done it.

25:05.938 --> 25:07.006
Exactly.

25:07.039 --> 25:08.575
(chuckles softly)

25:08.608 --> 25:10.109
But why would Darius
risk torture

25:10.142 --> 25:12.144
when he had an
ironclad alibi?

25:18.084 --> 25:21.721
Because he was
protecting me.

25:21.754 --> 25:23.723
(sighs):
Oh, my God.

25:23.756 --> 25:26.859
Right, the uranium that
could be traced back to you.

25:26.893 --> 25:29.629
He can't save himself without
throwing me to the wolves.

25:29.662 --> 25:31.831
The EmDrive doesn't
need a nuclear fuel source,

25:31.864 --> 25:34.601
but the Salvation does.

25:34.634 --> 25:37.303
All of this is to ensure,

25:37.336 --> 25:41.874
in a worst-case scenario,
that the best of us survives.

25:43.876 --> 25:46.012
He's not Nero,
he's Noah.

25:49.849 --> 25:52.184
How do we clear his name
without using his alibi?

25:54.053 --> 25:56.689
We find the real mole ourselves.

25:58.024 --> 25:59.258
Finally, a conjugal visit.

26:02.829 --> 26:05.164
I usually prefer
curvier types, but...

26:06.265 --> 26:08.167
...you have such pretty eyes.

26:12.905 --> 26:15.241
He left us no choice.

26:15.274 --> 26:18.277
Sometimes the ends
do justify the means.

26:24.050 --> 26:26.052
(phone vibrating)

26:32.725 --> 26:34.727
Looks like
it's just you and me.

26:36.328 --> 26:37.797
And him.

26:37.830 --> 26:39.331
TESS:
Hello, Darius.

26:39.365 --> 26:41.668
What are you doing
in Darius's private quarters?

26:41.701 --> 26:44.070
Shouldn't I be asking you
the same thing?

26:46.038 --> 26:47.974
You know nothing about me.

26:48.007 --> 26:49.642
Even less about him.

26:49.676 --> 26:51.043
Then illuminate us.

26:51.077 --> 26:53.279
Quickly. Or I call the FBI
and have you arrested

26:53.312 --> 26:55.281
for hacking
the U.S. space program.

26:55.314 --> 26:57.416
INTERROGATOR:
I'm gonna ask you a question.

26:57.449 --> 26:59.285
Who are you working for?

26:59.318 --> 27:01.120
What is the encryption key?

27:01.153 --> 27:03.756
And how do we regain control
of the probe?

27:04.824 --> 27:06.158
(gagging)

27:06.192 --> 27:07.359
(coughing)

27:07.393 --> 27:08.861
That was...

27:08.895 --> 27:11.263
(coughing)

27:11.297 --> 27:13.700
...three questions, actually.

27:13.733 --> 27:15.267
You're not so good
at math, eh?

27:18.104 --> 27:20.139
Who are you working for?

27:20.172 --> 27:21.340
What is the encryption key?

27:21.373 --> 27:23.743
How do we regain
control of the probe?

27:23.776 --> 27:25.678
(grunting)

27:25.712 --> 27:27.346
(gasping)

27:27.379 --> 27:29.816
If there's any humanity
left in you, Tanz,

27:29.849 --> 27:31.718
you still have time
to do the right thing.

27:31.751 --> 27:33.820
(laughing)

27:33.853 --> 27:34.987
You think this is funny?

27:35.021 --> 27:35.988
(laughing)

27:36.022 --> 27:38.124
Just ironic...

27:38.157 --> 27:40.292
to hear you use
the word "humanity."

27:40.326 --> 27:41.360
(laughing)

27:41.393 --> 27:43.863
Well, here we go again.

27:46.132 --> 27:47.399
Who are you working for?!

27:50.169 --> 27:51.337
(intercom buzzes)
Stop.

27:53.005 --> 27:54.974
The odds of this yielding
accurate information

27:55.007 --> 27:56.375
is low, very low.

27:56.408 --> 27:58.377
We both know that.

27:58.410 --> 28:02.048
Harris, I may not
personally outrank you,

28:02.081 --> 28:05.117
but you have a direct order
from your commander in chief.

28:05.151 --> 28:07.119
Stop, and I'll be
forced to make a call.

28:07.153 --> 28:08.955
A call that could
cost you your job

28:08.988 --> 28:11.357
and most likely
your freedom.

28:18.164 --> 28:19.999
(intercom buzzes)
Proceed.

28:20.032 --> 28:22.869
LAZLO: I checked the history
of every secure terminal

28:22.902 --> 28:24.771
on our network.

28:24.804 --> 28:26.005
All 2,200 of them.

28:26.038 --> 28:27.974
No known terminal
issued that signal.

28:28.007 --> 28:30.442
Unless there's a station
no one knows about.

28:30.476 --> 28:31.944
That we don't know about.

28:31.978 --> 28:33.079
Darius hates anything

28:33.112 --> 28:35.147
that slows him down.

28:35.181 --> 28:38.150
Once, he shut down a firewall
because it was interfering

28:38.184 --> 28:39.518
with a holographic
conferencing system

28:39.551 --> 28:40.920
he was tinkering with.

28:40.953 --> 28:42.388
It's possible he has

28:42.421 --> 28:44.190
a private terminal
somewhere on the site.

28:44.223 --> 28:46.158
Well, then it's possible
that the mole found that

28:46.192 --> 28:48.194
and used it to lock us
out of the probe.

28:48.227 --> 28:50.329
If we find that terminal,
we might regain control.

28:50.362 --> 28:53.265
There's over 500,000
square feet of ground

28:53.299 --> 28:55.034
to cover in this building alone.

28:55.067 --> 28:56.302
How much time
do we have?

28:56.335 --> 28:57.870
Less than four hours.

28:57.904 --> 29:01.073
Well, then it's impossible
without Darius's help.

29:02.942 --> 29:04.476
And what if Harris won't
let you talk to him?

29:04.510 --> 29:05.377
I'll figure something out.

29:05.411 --> 29:07.146
Right now, the EmDrive
is our best chance.

29:07.179 --> 29:08.414
It may be our only chance.

29:08.447 --> 29:10.783
Well, then why is Darius
building the ark?

29:10.817 --> 29:13.920
The ark is Darius's
backup plan.

29:13.953 --> 29:16.322
You are plan "A."

29:16.355 --> 29:18.190
He believes in you, Liam.

29:18.224 --> 29:20.793
So do I.

29:26.866 --> 29:29.201
I need you to run
a comprehensive background check

29:29.235 --> 29:31.804
on a Tanz employee--
name's Lazlo Simms.

29:35.975 --> 29:39.178
Ah, that's the longest minute
I ever experienced.

29:39.211 --> 29:40.446
I thought you'd had it.

29:40.479 --> 29:42.214
Me, too.

29:42.248 --> 29:43.816
Now, where are we?

29:43.850 --> 29:45.517
Take a look.

29:52.959 --> 29:54.393
(computer chimes)

29:55.627 --> 29:58.230
The microwaves are being
absorbed by the interior lining.

29:58.264 --> 30:00.099
And they're falling
out of alignment

30:00.132 --> 30:01.367
because the chamber isn't
reflective enough.
Mm-hmm.

30:01.400 --> 30:03.535
And after a few seconds,
they stop bouncing

30:03.569 --> 30:05.104
and start penetrating the core.

30:05.137 --> 30:06.072
And if the lining
isn't perfect...

30:06.105 --> 30:07.406
Then the whole house
eventually collapses.

30:07.439 --> 30:08.540
So if our copper lining
was stronger...

30:08.574 --> 30:10.542
And more reflective...

30:10.576 --> 30:11.944
Then we'd sustain thrust.

30:11.978 --> 30:13.412
We need a better lining.
Yeah.

30:15.181 --> 30:16.883
(coughing)

30:21.453 --> 30:22.521
(intercom buzzes)
Enough.

30:22.554 --> 30:24.991
I'm authorizing
chem agent R-4.

30:25.024 --> 30:26.859
That's a barely blunted
neurotoxin-- it's barbaric.

30:28.160 --> 30:30.029
It's also effective.

30:30.062 --> 30:31.998
We're running out
of time, Harris.

30:32.031 --> 30:33.432
If you have another idea,
I'm listening.

30:33.465 --> 30:35.334
GRACE: How about
letting him go?

30:38.437 --> 30:40.873
You want a solution,
I've got one.

30:40.907 --> 30:42.274
But I need Darius
alert and lucid,

30:42.308 --> 30:44.276
not the shell
of a man he'll be

30:44.310 --> 30:45.511
if you stick that needle in him.

30:45.544 --> 30:47.880
Harris, stop this.
It's not his call.

30:47.914 --> 30:49.015
I don't give a damn
where the orders come from.

30:49.048 --> 30:49.815
Darius is innocent.

30:49.848 --> 30:51.984
And you know this how?
I just know.

30:52.018 --> 30:54.120
I swear it
on my own life, Harris.

30:54.153 --> 30:56.889
Please. Right now,
I need you to trust me.

30:56.923 --> 30:57.957
Our very survival
is at stake,

30:57.990 --> 31:00.159
and you expect us
to just take your word for it?

31:00.192 --> 31:01.894
Harris.

31:01.928 --> 31:03.162
Please.

31:03.195 --> 31:04.430
I know what I'm asking,

31:04.463 --> 31:05.965
and I know the consequences
if I'm wrong.

31:05.998 --> 31:08.534
But think about the
consequences if I'm right.

31:09.568 --> 31:11.170
Stop this.

31:13.339 --> 31:15.541
Stand down. New orders.

31:15.574 --> 31:17.009
Unstrap him.

31:17.043 --> 31:18.911
If you're wrong, they'll
burn you for this.

31:18.945 --> 31:21.580
If I'm wrong,
we're all going to burn.

31:21.613 --> 31:24.450
Clear out.

31:24.483 --> 31:25.651
Come on.

31:25.684 --> 31:27.920
(coughing)

31:27.954 --> 31:29.321
I got you.

31:29.355 --> 31:31.023
TANZ: Took you
long enough, Harris.

31:31.057 --> 31:32.591
Wasn't me.

31:35.327 --> 31:37.163
Get him some dry clothes.

31:38.297 --> 31:39.665
(groans softly)

31:39.698 --> 31:41.067
I'm sorry.

31:41.100 --> 31:42.468
Darius, we don't
have a lot of time.

31:42.501 --> 31:44.336
Can you stand?

31:50.042 --> 31:51.343
You found Salvation.

31:51.377 --> 31:53.212
Yeah.
(sighs)

31:53.245 --> 31:55.247
But not the mole.

31:55.281 --> 31:57.616
Lazlo thinks the hacker
used an unsecured terminal

31:57.649 --> 31:59.551
on the Tanz network,
but if that's true,

31:59.585 --> 32:02.088
it must have been
installed by you.

32:02.121 --> 32:03.455
What reason would I have

32:03.489 --> 32:06.025
to add an unsecured computer
to my own network?

32:06.058 --> 32:08.594
It runs counter to every...

32:08.627 --> 32:11.998
I need a phone.
Get me a phone.

32:16.335 --> 32:18.437
CROFT: Okay, so
that was platinum.

32:18.470 --> 32:22.208
We've tried dusting the lining
with platinum, with glass.

32:22.241 --> 32:23.375
We even tried gold,

32:23.409 --> 32:24.743
like in the Webb telescope.

32:24.776 --> 32:26.345
What about a
crystalline lattice?

32:26.378 --> 32:27.980
Right? Crystals are
highly reflective.

32:28.014 --> 32:29.181
I tried that years ago.

32:29.215 --> 32:30.516
Nothing.

32:30.549 --> 32:33.252
(sighs) I'm afraid...

32:33.285 --> 32:36.455
we're looking for a substance
that doesn't exist.

32:36.488 --> 32:39.225
(phone vibrating)

32:39.258 --> 32:40.559
Oh, Pentagon.

32:45.031 --> 32:46.365
LIAM: Hello?
Liam. (coughs)

32:46.398 --> 32:48.134
Darius?

32:48.167 --> 32:49.201
Are you okay?

32:49.235 --> 32:50.669
I know where the hack came from.

32:50.702 --> 32:52.304
Get your ass
to the breakroom now.

33:03.749 --> 33:05.351
Okay.

33:05.384 --> 33:06.585
Okay, I'm here.

33:06.618 --> 33:08.054
Go to the arcade cabinet.

33:08.087 --> 33:09.188
The one in the southeast corner.

33:10.656 --> 33:12.691
Asteroids?

33:12.724 --> 33:14.426
Yes, that one.

33:14.460 --> 33:15.327
Remove the back panel.

33:22.068 --> 33:24.303
Uh, it's locked.

33:24.336 --> 33:26.105
It's locked.

33:34.346 --> 33:36.315
Whoa.

33:36.348 --> 33:37.316
Look for anything
out of the ordinary.

33:37.349 --> 33:38.750
Power supply.

33:38.784 --> 33:40.519
Motherboard.
RAM.

33:40.552 --> 33:42.454
Hard drive.

33:42.488 --> 33:44.090
Graphics card.

33:45.757 --> 33:47.459
What the hell?

33:47.493 --> 33:48.594
What do you see, Liam?

33:48.627 --> 33:50.729
Some kind of micro-PC

33:50.762 --> 33:52.464
piggybacking
one of the PCI slots.

33:52.498 --> 33:53.465
It looks like it's off though.

33:53.499 --> 33:54.600
Turn it on.

33:54.633 --> 33:55.201
Well, do you even know
what it does?

33:55.234 --> 33:56.302
You have a better idea?

33:59.571 --> 34:01.340
(beeping)

34:01.373 --> 34:03.442
(machine chiming)

34:13.385 --> 34:14.486
Whoa.
GRACE and TANZ: What?

34:14.520 --> 34:16.222
I don't know how they did it.

34:16.255 --> 34:18.724
Someone installed
this device and used it

34:18.757 --> 34:20.192
to tunnel through
the Tanz server,

34:20.226 --> 34:21.393
accessing Darius's
satellite network.

34:21.427 --> 34:22.694
And then they used it

34:22.728 --> 34:24.696
to send the mimic signal.
And lock out NASA.

34:24.730 --> 34:25.664
So what now?

34:25.697 --> 34:26.665
I-I can turn it off.

34:26.698 --> 34:27.666
I think I can turn it off.

34:27.699 --> 34:29.135
I can override the hack.

34:30.869 --> 34:31.837
DEXTER:
Sir!

34:31.870 --> 34:33.339
The probe just phoned home!

34:33.372 --> 34:35.141
We're back!
We're back in the driver's seat!

34:44.883 --> 34:46.718
Initiate correction burn.

34:46.752 --> 34:49.421
Burn in
three, two, one.

34:49.455 --> 34:50.756
Mark.

34:51.723 --> 34:52.824
HARRIS:
It's working.

34:52.858 --> 34:55.227
If we control the probe...

34:55.261 --> 34:56.662
We control our future.

34:56.695 --> 34:57.663
DEXTER:
Slight vibration here.

34:57.696 --> 34:59.231
Interference?

34:59.265 --> 35:01.500
Gravitational forces
are increasing.

35:01.533 --> 35:03.535
Getting stress warnings
all along the hull.

35:03.569 --> 35:05.504
Sir, the gravity
from Jupiter

35:05.537 --> 35:08.574
is too strong; we're
going to lose the probe.

35:08.607 --> 35:10.542
(alarm blaring, urgent chatter)

35:13.845 --> 35:15.847
(alarm blaring)

35:21.487 --> 35:22.788
It's gone.

35:25.924 --> 35:28.126
We're too late.

35:37.536 --> 35:40.472
HARRIS: Who else knew
about the console's ability

35:40.506 --> 35:42.708
to connect to the outside?
No one.

35:42.741 --> 35:43.709
No one?

35:43.742 --> 35:45.877
Do I look like a guy

35:45.911 --> 35:48.747
who invites employees to hang
during my downtime?

35:48.780 --> 35:50.282
Yes.

35:50.316 --> 35:51.283
Actually, you do.

35:51.317 --> 35:53.619
Thanks, but I told you,

35:53.652 --> 35:56.455
Wozniak and I have a standing
Friday night face-off.

35:56.488 --> 35:59.725
That firewall was really
throwing a wrench into it.

35:59.758 --> 36:01.593
That game was for me and Woz.

36:01.627 --> 36:04.196
And occasionally
Bezos and Shakira.

36:06.298 --> 36:07.599
Electronic wire fraud.

36:07.633 --> 36:10.236
Identify theft.

36:10.269 --> 36:12.238
(sighs)
Seven years in a federal lockup

36:12.271 --> 36:14.806
for hacking
a telecom data vault.

36:20.612 --> 36:22.681
Why didn't you tell us
your security chief,

36:22.714 --> 36:24.883
Lazlo Simms,
had a mile-long record,

36:24.916 --> 36:25.984
which, apparently,

36:26.017 --> 36:27.219
you paid to have expunged?

36:27.253 --> 36:30.256
We all have things in our past
we wish we could wash away.

36:31.790 --> 36:33.859
Laz is the only person
in the world

36:33.892 --> 36:35.261
I completely trust.

36:35.294 --> 36:36.595
He didn't do this.

36:36.628 --> 36:37.629
People change, Darius.

36:37.663 --> 36:41.333
They change, and they lie.

36:41.367 --> 36:42.601
And sometimes,

36:42.634 --> 36:44.736
they do it
right under your nose.

36:49.275 --> 36:50.942
(video winding)

37:09.961 --> 37:12.431
(sighs)

37:14.800 --> 37:16.802
Liam, what's going on?

37:19.571 --> 37:22.007
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

37:22.040 --> 37:24.376
Does it have
something to do

37:24.410 --> 37:26.712
with the woman
from the Pentagon?

37:28.847 --> 37:31.483
Yes and no.

37:31.517 --> 37:33.485
I just...

37:33.519 --> 37:35.921
Tell me something.

37:35.954 --> 37:39.057
Anything good.

37:39.090 --> 37:41.993
Oh, well...

37:42.027 --> 37:44.563
I was thinking about
what you said earlier--

37:44.596 --> 37:47.766
how Darius does
everything for a reason--

37:47.799 --> 37:50.836
and I think maybe
the reason I'm here

37:50.869 --> 37:54.573
is because I'm not like
any of those people.

37:54.606 --> 37:57.042
They're all head.

37:57.075 --> 37:58.710
No heart.

38:00.446 --> 38:03.715
No, you're not
like anybody, Jillian.

38:03.749 --> 38:05.517
You're the icosahedrite.

38:07.619 --> 38:09.655
Otherworldly.

38:21.767 --> 38:23.869
He tried crystals.

38:23.902 --> 38:25.737
But he didn't try
the icosahedrite

38:25.771 --> 38:27.072
because that doesn't
exist on Earth.

38:27.105 --> 38:28.474
What?

38:28.507 --> 38:29.741
Inspiration comes when
you're not looking.

38:29.775 --> 38:31.777
I know what
I have to do.

38:47.859 --> 38:49.928
Tess?

38:49.961 --> 38:53.665
Unlock the trophy case now.

38:55.534 --> 38:56.835
Please.

38:56.868 --> 38:58.537
(lock beeps)

39:03.542 --> 39:04.610
TANZ:
Karissa, where's Lazlo?

39:04.643 --> 39:05.811
I can't reach him.

39:05.844 --> 39:08.780
He last swiped into
the Treehouse.

39:14.820 --> 39:17.155
Lazlo, we need to talk.

39:17.188 --> 39:19.791
Laz.

39:21.460 --> 39:22.528
(gasps)

39:25.531 --> 39:27.733
HARRIS: He knew the walls
were closing in.

39:27.766 --> 39:30.469
Who the hell
was he working for?

39:33.572 --> 39:35.707
JILLIAN:
Darius Tanz

39:35.741 --> 39:39.010
brought all of us together
to find the 160.

39:39.044 --> 39:42.914
160 people worth saving.

39:42.948 --> 39:45.617
Or to play God,
as Mason so aptly put it.

39:46.785 --> 39:49.688
But if we truly want to endure,

39:49.721 --> 39:53.024
we can't just focus
on what it takes

39:53.058 --> 39:54.593
to merely survive.

39:54.626 --> 39:56.762
We have to focus
on what it takes

39:56.795 --> 39:58.864
to truly live.

40:02.133 --> 40:04.069
And that doesn't
just come from the head.

40:06.672 --> 40:09.107
It comes from the heart.

40:14.713 --> 40:16.682
So the nonessentials,

40:16.715 --> 40:18.016
as you call them--

40:18.049 --> 40:19.685
the writers,
the artists, the dreamers--

40:19.718 --> 40:22.153
they are essential,
because in our darkest hours,

40:22.187 --> 40:24.823
they give us
the most essential ingredient

40:24.856 --> 40:27.192
to the survival of our species:

40:27.225 --> 40:29.094
hope.

40:40.806 --> 40:47.479
And in the end, it is hope
and only hope that will save us.

40:54.653 --> 40:55.654
Hey, Professor Croft?

40:56.788 --> 40:58.156
Professor Croft, wake up.

40:58.189 --> 40:59.858
Hey, wake up.

41:12.203 --> 41:14.606
The EmDrive.

41:14.640 --> 41:17.609
It works.

41:24.783 --> 41:26.818
(urgent chatter)

41:28.153 --> 41:29.655
TANZ: I want this
room cleared out

41:29.688 --> 41:31.256
in ten minutes;
get everything to the warehouse.

41:31.289 --> 41:34.059
Nelson will instruct
you from there.

41:34.092 --> 41:35.761
The EmDrive works.

41:35.794 --> 41:38.296
We should be drinking champagne
right now, you know,

41:38.329 --> 41:40.065
wearing pointy hats.

41:40.098 --> 41:41.700
I want to dump Gatorade
all over your head.

41:41.733 --> 41:42.868
The prototype works.

41:42.901 --> 41:44.202
We'll drink when we actually

41:44.235 --> 41:47.138
launch a gravity tractor
with a full-sized EmDrive.

41:47.172 --> 41:50.208
Darius, if we could just
stay put, I mean, we could be

41:50.241 --> 41:52.678
halfway through the calculations
for the full-scale model by now.

41:52.711 --> 41:54.680
Someone here
hacked the IO Probe

41:54.713 --> 41:56.915
and killed Lazlo to
cover their tracks.

41:56.948 --> 41:59.150
The EmDrive is no
longer safe at Tanz.

41:59.184 --> 42:01.653
Neither are you.
(alarm blaring)

42:01.687 --> 42:03.555
TESS (automated voice):
Lockdown initiating.

42:03.589 --> 42:05.724
All employees report to Sandbox
for further instructions.

42:05.757 --> 42:08.093
LIAM: You put the
place on lockdown?

42:08.126 --> 42:10.996
Yesterday, the FBI said
that Lazlo killed himself.

42:11.029 --> 42:13.865
The FBI says a lot of things.
Doesn't make them true.

42:13.899 --> 42:15.734
Exactly. Which
is why we're not

42:15.767 --> 42:17.135
telling the government
the EmDrive works.

42:17.168 --> 42:19.671
Not until we know
who we can trust.

42:19.705 --> 42:21.740
I am sorry for your loss.

42:21.773 --> 42:22.741
Oh, no.

42:22.774 --> 42:25.043
Don't feel sorry for me.

42:25.076 --> 42:27.212
Feel sorry for the one
who violated my trust,

42:27.245 --> 42:29.915
'cause I'm going
to destroy them.

42:41.126 --> 42:43.294
A billion dollars... gone.

42:43.328 --> 42:45.163
Not gone.

42:45.196 --> 42:46.765
An investment
that could still pay off.

42:46.798 --> 42:49.100
Could. Might. Maybe.

42:49.134 --> 42:52.103
I am done hearing those words
from Darius Tanz.

42:52.137 --> 42:53.672
The EmDrive melted down,

42:53.705 --> 42:55.674
and he burned through
a billion dollars.

42:55.707 --> 42:57.108
It's time to cut the cord.

42:57.142 --> 42:59.310
Cut the cord?

42:59.344 --> 43:02.814
Darius is no longer a
member of this task force.

43:02.848 --> 43:03.815
What?

43:03.849 --> 43:05.383
We're pulling his funding.

43:05.416 --> 43:07.118
The government is done
with Tanz Industries.

43:07.152 --> 43:08.620
We've lost control
of space.

43:08.654 --> 43:09.888
We're out of options.

43:09.921 --> 43:11.256
Darius is our best hope
right now.

43:11.289 --> 43:12.357
Our best hope?

43:12.390 --> 43:14.726
He squandered
a billion dollars.

43:14.760 --> 43:17.629
The EmDrive project crashed
and burned spectacularly.

43:17.663 --> 43:20.899
And now we find out
that NASA was hacked

43:20.932 --> 43:22.100
by one of his own people.

43:22.133 --> 43:23.869
Am I missing something
here, Ms. Barrows?

43:23.902 --> 43:24.803
You've already helped him

43:24.836 --> 43:27.405
drain this task force
of time and money.

43:27.438 --> 43:29.741
There's only one of those
we can get back.

43:29.775 --> 43:32.678
You're saying
you want him to return

43:32.711 --> 43:34.646
the billion dollars we gave him?

43:34.680 --> 43:39.184
No, I'm saying you want him
to return that money.

43:39.217 --> 43:42.654
Get it back, or you'll be
off this task force, too.

43:48.426 --> 43:50.395
Grace? Grace, wait.

43:50.428 --> 43:52.097
A little heads-up would
be nice next time.

43:52.130 --> 43:53.364
You let me get
sandbagged in there.

43:53.398 --> 43:54.632
Grace, this isn't
about you.

43:54.666 --> 43:57.402
You're pulling funding from
the one thing that can save us.

43:57.435 --> 43:59.004
That's unfair.

43:59.037 --> 44:00.371
You've never liked him.

44:00.405 --> 44:02.674
Well, maybe you like him
too much.

44:02.708 --> 44:04.442
What's that supposed to mean?
(scoffs)

44:04.475 --> 44:06.812
It means your vision
gets a little cloudy

44:06.845 --> 44:08.246
when it comes to Darius Tanz.

44:08.279 --> 44:10.115
Yeah, you act as if
he's the messiah

44:10.148 --> 44:11.382
and we're all just
his disciples,

44:11.416 --> 44:12.951
never allowed
to question him.

44:12.984 --> 44:15.821
There are people
he has to answer to, Grace,

44:15.854 --> 44:17.255
and I'm one of them.

44:21.760 --> 44:24.029
You can't kick me off
this task force.

44:24.062 --> 44:26.732
I'm the only one keeping
the barbarians at the gate.

44:26.765 --> 44:27.733
(elevator bell dings)

44:27.766 --> 44:29.034
And you're one of them.

44:33.739 --> 44:35.440
Get me proof that the
EmDrive has a shot.

44:35.473 --> 44:38.243
I can't sell it in that room
anymore without proof.

44:38.276 --> 44:40.445
Fine, I'll get you proof.

44:41.980 --> 44:43.782
If you get that pit bull
off my back.

44:47.318 --> 44:49.320
POTUS wants to know
what our next step is.

44:55.060 --> 44:57.028
Easy with this, gentlemen.
It's one of a kind.

44:57.062 --> 44:58.029
Yes, sir.

44:58.063 --> 44:59.330
Easy. Don't bounce it.

44:59.364 --> 45:01.166
Darius, I got to
call Jillian.

45:01.199 --> 45:02.333
I need a second.
Don't shake it.

45:02.367 --> 45:04.069
There's no time.
Call her from the road.

45:07.038 --> 45:09.140
I-Is he the only guy
going with us?

45:09.174 --> 45:11.409
I need to keep the circle tight.

45:15.346 --> 45:18.483
Can you just tell me
she's safe, please?

45:18.516 --> 45:20.318
I've hired the best
security force in the world.

45:20.351 --> 45:22.053
From here on,
no one will breathe

45:22.087 --> 45:23.521
without me knowing about it.

45:23.554 --> 45:26.291
I'll meet you there.
Now go.

45:26.324 --> 45:27.993
Okay.

45:29.895 --> 45:31.429
(engine starts)

45:31.462 --> 45:32.864
(grunts)

45:40.538 --> 45:42.407
MAN (over P.A.):
Attention, employees,

45:42.440 --> 45:44.876
please comply with
all security requests.

45:44.910 --> 45:46.111
What's going on?

45:46.144 --> 45:47.278
(phone vibrates)

45:51.182 --> 45:53.518
MAN: I'm sorry, Tanz Industries
is closed for visitors today.

45:53.551 --> 45:55.821
GRACE: Uh, I'm not
here for a tour.

45:55.854 --> 45:57.188
I'm a personal guest
of Darius.

45:57.222 --> 45:58.857
Clear to go.

46:01.059 --> 46:03.028
Well, you be sure
to thank Darius for creating

46:03.061 --> 46:05.831
such a warm and inclusive
work environment.

46:05.864 --> 46:08.399
MAN (over P.A.):
Attention, employees,

46:08.433 --> 46:11.002
please comply with
all security requests.

46:26.351 --> 46:29.187
Darius, what's going on
down there?

46:29.220 --> 46:31.222
I'm finding out
who hacked the IO Probe,

46:31.256 --> 46:33.124
since the government
seems to have lost interest.

46:33.158 --> 46:34.592
(sighs)

46:34.625 --> 46:37.128
Lazlo hacked the probe.

46:37.162 --> 46:39.097
You need to accept that
and move on.

46:46.637 --> 46:49.875
Darius, everything is
at stake here.

46:49.908 --> 46:52.143
Yes, I'm aware, which is why
I've hired some former Mossad

46:52.177 --> 46:53.378
to conduct the investigation.

46:53.411 --> 46:54.545
Best interrogators
in the world.

46:54.579 --> 46:57.315
Unlike those amateurs
from Langley.

47:01.052 --> 47:03.421
The government's
cutting you off.

47:03.454 --> 47:05.023
They want their
money back,

47:05.056 --> 47:07.058
or what's left of it.
What?

47:07.092 --> 47:09.027
And they're throwing me off the
task force if I don't get it.

47:09.060 --> 47:11.362
No, not now. Now's the time
when we need it most.

47:11.396 --> 47:13.932
The EmDrive works, Grace.

47:13.965 --> 47:15.233
What?

47:15.266 --> 47:17.135
We're in the process
of scaling it up now.

47:17.168 --> 47:19.037
It's gonna take
massive amounts of material

47:19.070 --> 47:20.405
and hundreds of workers
around the clock

47:20.438 --> 47:21.940
to get this thing
built and launched.

47:21.973 --> 47:23.374
This little government tantrum

47:23.408 --> 47:25.343
could not have come
at a worse time.

47:28.146 --> 47:30.248
Y-You don't believe me.

47:30.281 --> 47:34.185
Said the man who sent me
on a wild uranium chase.

47:34.219 --> 47:36.321
For which, uh, you still
owe me an explanation

47:36.354 --> 47:37.655
or, I don't know, an apology.

47:37.688 --> 47:39.257
Oh, maybe a Hallmark card.

47:39.290 --> 47:41.392
"Sorry I made you
steal uranium for my ark."

47:41.426 --> 47:43.929
Soon as I get my "Sorry I let
them waterboard you" card

47:43.962 --> 47:44.930
in the mail.

47:44.963 --> 47:47.598
Darius, I'm sorry. I...

47:47.632 --> 47:49.200
I'm desperately sorry
for what happened,

47:49.234 --> 47:51.069
and I want to believe
you, but right now,

47:51.102 --> 47:53.204
I have too many questions
and not enough answers.

47:53.238 --> 47:57.075
I can't go back to the Pentagon
without proof the EmDrive works.

47:57.108 --> 47:59.911
Okay, follow me.

48:04.582 --> 48:06.484
You want proof?
You want answers?

48:06.517 --> 48:08.086
Yes, I do.

48:08.119 --> 48:09.520
Get in.

48:32.743 --> 48:36.147
(echoing):
Who are you?

48:42.187 --> 48:43.989
Hey, Amanda.

48:44.022 --> 48:46.524
Thank God.
How you feeling?

48:46.557 --> 48:48.093
Sore.

48:48.126 --> 48:50.195
Yeah, well, you
got hit by a car.

48:50.228 --> 48:53.098
How long have I been here?

48:53.131 --> 48:55.200
Couple days.

48:59.437 --> 49:02.607
Someone was here, Ed,
in the room.

49:02.640 --> 49:05.376
This creepy guy
in a hoodie.

49:05.410 --> 49:08.513
Doctor said you might be
just a little confused

49:08.546 --> 49:11.049
after the accident
'cause of the concussion.

49:22.593 --> 49:24.729
It wasn't an accident.

49:26.197 --> 49:28.166
I think someone tried
to kill me.

49:29.634 --> 49:31.069
Who?

49:32.637 --> 49:35.340
I don't know.

49:35.373 --> 49:38.143
But I'm gonna find out.

49:38.176 --> 49:41.346
LIAM: What do you think Darius
is doing to the employees?

49:41.379 --> 49:44.482
He's probably just
asking them some questions.

49:44.515 --> 49:47.452
Yeah, but, I mean, you saw
how crazy he was acting, right?

49:47.485 --> 49:49.187
I just don't want
Jillian to feel like...

49:49.220 --> 49:50.721
The fate of the world
is at stake,

49:50.755 --> 49:53.758
and you're worried about
your little puppy love? Hmm?

49:55.226 --> 49:56.594
Okay. Well, first,
I'm not a puppy.

49:56.627 --> 49:58.429
And second, what the hell
is your problem?

49:58.463 --> 49:59.530
(loud bang)

49:59.564 --> 50:01.032
(tire thumping)

50:01.066 --> 50:03.434
What's happening?
It's a flat.

50:03.468 --> 50:05.236
Nothing to
worry about.

50:10.641 --> 50:13.078
Sit tight...
(gunshot)

50:13.111 --> 50:14.212
Aah!

50:14.245 --> 50:16.481
Hands on your head!
Get out of car, now!

50:16.514 --> 50:18.149
Okay, okay.

50:19.250 --> 50:20.518
Phone!

50:24.255 --> 50:25.223
Get in!

50:25.256 --> 50:26.291
Okay. Okay.

50:34.265 --> 50:36.301
(engine revving)

50:54.152 --> 50:56.554
You guys working for someone?
Is it the government maybe?

50:56.587 --> 50:57.655
Because we have friends
at the Pentagon.

50:57.688 --> 50:59.090
We can give them a call

50:59.124 --> 51:00.291
and clear this whole
thing right up.

51:01.559 --> 51:02.460
You want money?

51:02.493 --> 51:04.395
One phone call, I can
make that happen.

51:04.429 --> 51:06.331
(whispers):
Would you shut up?

51:06.364 --> 51:07.832
You're gonna
get us killed.

51:07.865 --> 51:10.801
Listen to your friend.

51:10.835 --> 51:13.204
LIAM:
9-1-1,

51:13.238 --> 51:14.339
my professor,
his place is trashed.

51:14.372 --> 51:16.107
He didn't show up for class.

51:16.141 --> 51:18.409
There were big scary goons
staking out his house.

51:18.443 --> 51:20.445
They chased my ass across town.

51:33.558 --> 51:35.493
We're plotting possible
intercept courses

51:35.526 --> 51:37.595
with the asteroid to see
which countries have available

51:37.628 --> 51:39.497
spacecraft out near Samson.

51:39.530 --> 51:41.599
Then we'll approach them
about a collaborative mission.

51:41.632 --> 51:43.601
But we still don't know
who was behind the hack.

51:43.634 --> 51:45.270
How do we know who we can trust?

51:45.303 --> 51:47.638
We don't. It's a process.

51:47.672 --> 51:49.274
And what do we say?

51:49.307 --> 51:51.276
"Pardon me, but do you mind
if we destroy

51:51.309 --> 51:53.478
your billion-dollar space toy
for no apparent reason?"

51:53.511 --> 51:54.812
It'll look
like an accident.

51:54.845 --> 51:59.450
By then, it's too late
for anyone to object.

51:59.484 --> 52:01.186
Claire,

52:01.219 --> 52:03.588
you were a little rough
on Grace Barrows this morning.

52:03.621 --> 52:04.522
Was I?

52:04.555 --> 52:07.258
Threatening to throw her
off the task force?

52:07.292 --> 52:09.194
She's been working
day and night,

52:09.227 --> 52:11.462
like the rest of us,
trying to find solutions.

52:11.496 --> 52:14.165
Well, she's created more
problems than anything else.

52:14.199 --> 52:18.736
You know, I-I get the feeling
sometimes that it's personal.

52:18.769 --> 52:23.208
Is it personal for me,
Harris, or for you?

52:24.242 --> 52:25.676
DEXTER:
Sir.

52:25.710 --> 52:27.945
I've located three probes
that can reach Samson.

52:27.978 --> 52:29.847
The closest one
can intercept in 12 days.

52:29.880 --> 52:31.216
Who does it belong to?

52:31.249 --> 52:32.583
DEXTER:
China.

52:32.617 --> 52:33.618
CLAIRE: China's not
gonna work with us.

52:33.651 --> 52:35.620
Moving on.

52:35.653 --> 52:37.755
DEXTER: Here's one that can
impact Samson in 22 days:

52:37.788 --> 52:38.756
the Mahnaz Probe.

52:38.789 --> 52:40.458
Iran.
Try again.

52:41.659 --> 52:43.328
DEXTER:
Last one is the furthest out.

52:43.361 --> 52:44.562
But a collision

52:44.595 --> 52:46.964
could be possible in
79 days: the Bijali.

52:46.997 --> 52:48.433
India.

52:48.466 --> 52:49.467
A U.S. ally.

52:49.500 --> 52:51.502
Jackpot.

52:54.939 --> 52:56.774
GRACE:
Where are we exactly?

52:56.807 --> 52:58.576
I thought we were
going to see the EmDrive.

52:58.609 --> 53:00.511
We are. Eventually.

53:00.545 --> 53:01.779
Eventually?

53:01.812 --> 53:03.581
Darius, where are we going?

53:03.614 --> 53:06.317
Lazlo's house.
Or safe house, actually.

53:06.351 --> 53:07.518
What?

53:07.552 --> 53:08.919
You lied to me again.

53:08.953 --> 53:10.421
I never lied to you.

53:10.455 --> 53:11.922
How do you say that
with a straight face?

53:11.956 --> 53:14.792
I told you that I needed
uranium to save the human race.

53:14.825 --> 53:16.394
That's true.
Okay.

53:16.427 --> 53:18.329
Your facility for
self-rationalization

53:18.363 --> 53:19.697
is alarming.

53:19.730 --> 53:20.965
What's alarming is
your self-delusion.

53:20.998 --> 53:22.867
If I'm right...
And you're certain you are.

53:22.900 --> 53:24.669
Lazlo is not the mole!

53:24.702 --> 53:26.871
And it doesn't matter whether
or not the EmDrive works.

53:26.904 --> 53:27.838
Nothing we do matters,

53:27.872 --> 53:29.974
because someone will
always be sabotaging us.

53:35.446 --> 53:37.415
GRACE:
What are we doing here?

53:37.448 --> 53:39.950
Laz uploaded something
onto a private remote server

53:39.984 --> 53:41.686
in the last moments of his life.

53:41.719 --> 53:44.489
Yeah. Probably all of
Tanz Industries' secrets.

53:44.522 --> 53:46.624
Or the answer to his murder.

53:57.902 --> 53:59.804
This is where he lived?

53:59.837 --> 54:01.906
He was a quiet man.

54:01.939 --> 54:04.875
With demons.

54:25.496 --> 54:27.632
Is this you?

54:30.501 --> 54:32.002
Yes.

54:40.845 --> 54:42.447
You're all set, Ms. Neel.

54:42.480 --> 54:45.416
Thank you.
Thanks.

54:45.450 --> 54:48.686
Okay, let's get you out of here
and off of this story.

54:48.719 --> 54:50.721
What? I can't stop now.
(phone chimes)

54:53.391 --> 54:54.992
This isn't my phone.

54:55.025 --> 54:56.761
Did you put this in my bag?

54:56.794 --> 54:57.862
No.

54:57.895 --> 55:00.731
Then I wasn't hallucinating.

55:00.765 --> 55:02.467
There was someone else
in my room.

55:02.500 --> 55:04.869
Get rid of that phone.

55:04.902 --> 55:07.071
Just throw it away now.

55:12.710 --> 55:14.779
Amanda, as your boss,

55:14.812 --> 55:16.914
I am telling you,
you are off of this story

55:16.947 --> 55:18.649
or you're fired; you hear me?

55:18.683 --> 55:20.618
Yeah, I hear you.

55:20.651 --> 55:22.387
No story is worth dying for.

55:23.454 --> 55:25.390
Yeah. You're right.

55:25.423 --> 55:26.924
Yeah, I know.

55:26.957 --> 55:28.659
Come on.

55:30.127 --> 55:31.929
(groans):
Ooh...

55:31.962 --> 55:32.963
Whoa, you okay?

55:32.997 --> 55:34.098
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

55:34.131 --> 55:35.766
They said I might have
some dizziness

55:35.800 --> 55:36.934
over the next few days.

55:36.967 --> 55:39.404
Okay, I'll find you
a wheelchair,

55:39.437 --> 55:40.805
and we'll roll you out of here.

55:40.838 --> 55:42.740
Okay.
Okay.

55:43.908 --> 55:45.910
*

56:10.668 --> 56:12.770
GRACE:
What are we looking at?

56:12.803 --> 56:15.440
The last image Lazlo saw
before he died.

56:15.473 --> 56:17.608
GRACE: Who could possibly
identify that?

56:17.642 --> 56:18.976
(line ringing)

56:19.009 --> 56:20.044
KARISSA:
Yes, Darius?

56:20.077 --> 56:22.046
Karissa, I'm sending you
a photo file.

56:22.079 --> 56:24.114
Have Tess run it through
our facial rec software.

56:24.148 --> 56:25.783
See if she can
find a match.

56:25.816 --> 56:26.817
Right away.

56:28.218 --> 56:29.987
(door unlocking)

56:35.760 --> 56:37.495
Darius.

56:38.496 --> 56:40.030
Theresa.

56:42.099 --> 56:43.701
Oh, my God.

56:43.734 --> 56:44.702
It's been...

56:44.735 --> 56:45.936
15 years.

56:49.540 --> 56:53.210
Uh, this is, uh, Grace Barrows,
a work, a work colleague.

56:53.243 --> 56:54.812
Grace, this is

56:54.845 --> 56:56.046
Theresa.

56:56.080 --> 56:57.848
Lazlo's sister.

57:00.918 --> 57:04.154
Oh, well, congratulations
on all your success.

57:04.188 --> 57:06.791
It's pretty hard
not to keep tabs on you.

57:06.824 --> 57:10.628
And-and you're married,
two girls?

57:10.661 --> 57:13.163
Yeah, seven and two.

57:13.197 --> 57:16.501
Laz probably bored you
with photos of them.

57:16.534 --> 57:20.137
I haven't heard from
him in a couple days,

57:20.170 --> 57:21.906
so I got worried.

57:21.939 --> 57:23.541
Is he here?

57:26.511 --> 57:28.879
Maybe we should,
we should step outside.

57:28.913 --> 57:30.915
Okay.

57:38.022 --> 57:40.024
*

57:58.676 --> 58:00.010
HARRIS:
Ambassador Gupta,

58:00.044 --> 58:02.813
we're honored
to sit with you today.

58:02.847 --> 58:05.683
The pleasure is mine,
Deputy Secretary.

58:05.716 --> 58:08.085
My country has been
eager to collaborate

58:08.118 --> 58:10.287
with your space program
for some time.

58:10.320 --> 58:12.222
The question is: Why now?

58:12.256 --> 58:15.025
India is emerging as a
major player in space.

58:15.059 --> 58:17.762
And, you know, frankly,
your landmark missions

58:17.795 --> 58:19.730
have come in at far
lower costs than ours.

58:19.764 --> 58:22.232
I think both
of our agencies

58:22.266 --> 58:24.769
could benefit from a new
level of cooperation.

58:24.802 --> 58:27.705
A cooperative effort with NASA
could be just the thing

58:27.738 --> 58:29.006
to boost our global profile.

58:29.039 --> 58:30.841
CLAIRE: Perhaps we
should engage in

58:30.875 --> 58:33.277
an off-books effort,
at the beginning.

58:33.310 --> 58:36.113
Just to make certain
that ISRO and NASA

58:36.146 --> 58:37.748
will mesh well.

58:37.782 --> 58:39.917
I don't understand.

58:39.950 --> 58:41.786
HARRIS: I think what
Claire is suggesting

58:41.819 --> 58:44.989
is that the United States join
one of ISRO's current missions

58:45.022 --> 58:46.791
already in progress.

58:46.824 --> 58:49.894
Are you looking for
something specific?

58:49.927 --> 58:51.896
CLAIRE: NASA would
like to access

58:51.929 --> 58:54.632
the Bijali Probe you currently
have out near Jupiter.

58:54.665 --> 58:58.035
NASA already has the IO Probe
in that region, no?

58:58.068 --> 58:59.303
HARRIS:
It's been...

58:59.336 --> 59:00.771
malfunctioning.

59:06.210 --> 59:09.614
It's not malfunctioning.

59:09.647 --> 59:10.848
It was hacked.

59:10.881 --> 59:12.650
Wasn't it?

59:12.683 --> 59:14.351
How did you know that?

59:14.384 --> 59:16.887
Because ours was hacked, too.

59:20.124 --> 59:22.192
CLAIRE:
My deepest condolences,
Theresa.

59:23.628 --> 59:25.162
It's Tess.

59:25.195 --> 59:26.797
You can call me Tess.

59:30.635 --> 59:32.670
Tess.

59:40.678 --> 59:44.915
Thank you... for taking care
of Laz for all of these years.

59:44.949 --> 59:48.886
I'm sorry I...
I couldn't protect him.

59:50.855 --> 59:53.958
You did.

59:53.991 --> 59:56.360
You saved his life, Darius.

1:00:06.671 --> 1:00:09.106
And whoever did this...

1:00:09.139 --> 1:00:10.975
find them.

1:00:13.210 --> 1:00:15.713
I promise.

1:00:31.228 --> 1:00:35.232
That photo of you
in front of the tree house--

1:00:35.265 --> 1:00:38.435
that was you with
Lazlo and Tess?

1:00:38.468 --> 1:00:41.271
Yeah.

1:00:43.040 --> 1:00:46.110
You were in love with her,
weren't you?

1:00:50.981 --> 1:00:53.350
Sorry.

1:00:53.383 --> 1:00:55.219
(phone vibrates)

1:00:55.252 --> 1:00:57.922
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Incoming call. Karissa.

1:00:57.955 --> 1:00:59.323
Yes.

1:00:59.356 --> 1:01:01.225
KARISSA:
Darius, facial rec has a match.

1:01:01.258 --> 1:01:03.127
Sending through now.

1:01:03.160 --> 1:01:05.162
Whoever infiltrated my game room
hacked that probe, Grace.

1:01:05.195 --> 1:01:08.098
And killed Lazlo
before they could be identified.

1:01:11.769 --> 1:01:13.370
Oh.

1:01:13.403 --> 1:01:15.272
Darius...
Damn it.

1:01:15.305 --> 1:01:17.174
How could I have been so blind?

1:01:19.443 --> 1:01:21.779
(engine revving)

1:01:23.413 --> 1:01:25.115
(quietly):
Croft.

1:01:25.149 --> 1:01:27.785
The driver--
he's the one who chased me

1:01:27.818 --> 1:01:29.153
after your place
was trashed.

1:01:29.186 --> 1:01:30.888
Are you sure?
Yeah.

1:01:30.921 --> 1:01:33.023
It's burned in my mind.
That whole day is.

1:01:33.057 --> 1:01:33.958
Ah.

1:01:33.991 --> 1:01:35.760
One of these Neanderthals
broke my glasses

1:01:35.793 --> 1:01:37.728
when they were
wrestling me out of the van.

1:01:42.767 --> 1:01:45.903
LIAM: His place is trashed.
He left his glasses behind.

1:01:45.936 --> 1:01:49.173
Your glasses--
can't you get another pair?

1:01:49.206 --> 1:01:51.241
No. These are antiques.
These were my grandfather's.

1:01:51.275 --> 1:01:52.810
They're one of a kind.

1:01:54.244 --> 1:01:56.080
Why?

1:01:58.182 --> 1:01:59.817
You all right?

1:01:59.850 --> 1:02:01.418
(grunts)

1:02:01.451 --> 1:02:03.453
Let me out
of the car!
Stop! Stop! Stop.

1:02:03.487 --> 1:02:05.122
Oh, God, it was you?

1:02:06.824 --> 1:02:08.325
You're the mole.

1:02:15.032 --> 1:02:17.067
Karissa, I can't raise Liam
or Nelson on the phone.

1:02:17.101 --> 1:02:18.936
KARISSA:
Tracking them.

1:02:18.969 --> 1:02:21.305
Their signals are... dead.

1:02:21.338 --> 1:02:23.173
When did they check in

1:02:23.207 --> 1:02:24.508
at the offsite facility?

1:02:24.541 --> 1:02:26.076
They didn't.

1:02:26.110 --> 1:02:28.145
Damn it!
Where are they?

1:02:28.178 --> 1:02:31.481
I don't know,
but Croft has the EmDrive.

1:02:31.515 --> 1:02:33.217
And Liam.

1:02:36.453 --> 1:02:38.355
You're a Russian spy?

1:02:38.388 --> 1:02:39.523
CROFT:
No.

1:02:39.556 --> 1:02:41.558
It's not like that.
I just, uh...

1:02:41.591 --> 1:02:45.262
supply technology...
for a price.

1:02:45.295 --> 1:02:47.031
(laughs)
Oh, don't be
so naive.

1:02:47.064 --> 1:02:48.332
It happens
all the time.

1:02:48.365 --> 1:02:50.835
How did you figure it out?

1:02:50.868 --> 1:02:52.036
Your glasses.

1:02:52.069 --> 1:02:54.038
Yeah, those
one-of-a-kind antiques?

1:02:54.071 --> 1:02:55.572
They were in your house
when you were

1:02:55.605 --> 1:02:57.107
supposedly running
for your life,

1:02:57.141 --> 1:02:58.542
and now they're on your face!

1:02:58.575 --> 1:03:00.845
Mm. (chuckles)

1:03:00.878 --> 1:03:02.379
Good observation.

1:03:02.412 --> 1:03:04.915
So the night you disappeared--
that was just a setup?

1:03:04.949 --> 1:03:06.016
No, after you left,

1:03:06.050 --> 1:03:08.252
I phoned a friend, like I said.

1:03:08.285 --> 1:03:09.920
But he didn't work for NASA.

1:03:09.954 --> 1:03:12.890
This is Malcolm Croft.

1:03:12.923 --> 1:03:16.360
Yes, I-I know what time it is,
but this can't wait.

1:03:16.393 --> 1:03:18.362
A student has
discovered something--

1:03:18.395 --> 1:03:21.131
an asteroid on a
collision course with the Earth.

1:03:21.165 --> 1:03:23.267
Extinction level.

1:03:23.300 --> 1:03:25.535
Totally certain.

1:03:25.569 --> 1:03:27.537
And as far as we knew,
you hadn't told anyone else

1:03:27.571 --> 1:03:31.108
about the asteroid, so you were
the dangling thread.

1:03:31.141 --> 1:03:32.609
And that's when
things started to get

1:03:32.642 --> 1:03:34.144
a little more complicated.

1:03:34.178 --> 1:03:37.014
The Russians tracked me
to Darius

1:03:37.047 --> 1:03:38.348
and into the Pentagon.

1:03:38.382 --> 1:03:40.417
That's when
they realized

1:03:40.450 --> 1:03:42.252
that the Pentagon
already knew everything,

1:03:42.286 --> 1:03:45.122
so we had to figure out what
their strategy was gonna be.

1:03:45.155 --> 1:03:48.558
You used me
to infiltrate Tanz,

1:03:48.592 --> 1:03:52.129
and then you hacked the kinetic
impactor to protect Russia.

1:03:52.162 --> 1:03:54.865
Why not have them kill me
like they did Lazlo?

1:03:54.899 --> 1:03:57.234
Just do it.

1:03:57.267 --> 1:03:59.904
Kill you?

1:04:02.472 --> 1:04:05.375
You are like the son
I never had.

1:04:07.344 --> 1:04:08.913
I want you to come with me.

1:04:08.946 --> 1:04:10.447
We could finish
the EmDrive together.

1:04:10.480 --> 1:04:12.950
Where?
Moscow.

1:04:12.983 --> 1:04:15.953
They will welcome us
like Snowden,

1:04:15.986 --> 1:04:17.654
we'll live like kings,

1:04:17.687 --> 1:04:19.323
and then we'll launch
the gravity tractor,

1:04:19.356 --> 1:04:20.991
and we will save the world.

1:04:21.025 --> 1:04:22.626
(door opens)

1:04:22.659 --> 1:04:24.194
LIAM:
You have no idea

1:04:24.228 --> 1:04:25.562
what they'll do
with the technology.

1:04:25.595 --> 1:04:27.631
You have no idea
what they'll do with us.

1:04:39.509 --> 1:04:43.380
Liam, think about it.

1:04:59.429 --> 1:05:01.431
(cell phone ringing)

1:05:08.638 --> 1:05:10.074
Who is this?

1:05:10.107 --> 1:05:12.142
MAN (distorted):
A friend with the same agenda.

1:05:12.176 --> 1:05:13.543
And what agenda is that?

1:05:13.577 --> 1:05:16.413
Atlas. Check the message.

1:05:16.446 --> 1:05:17.247
(phone vibrates, chimes)

1:05:20.150 --> 1:05:22.019
What am I looking at?
MAN: Zoom in.

1:05:22.052 --> 1:05:24.421
Here's the billion-dollar
question:

1:05:24.454 --> 1:05:27.391
What is Tanz technology doing
fused inside this rock?

1:05:31.228 --> 1:05:33.397
Who are you?

1:05:33.430 --> 1:05:34.598
(phone chirping)

1:05:36.166 --> 1:05:37.401
Resist?

1:05:37.434 --> 1:05:40.337
The global hacker collective?

1:05:40.370 --> 1:05:42.139
This is so Watergate.

1:05:42.172 --> 1:05:44.008
Wait, how'd you get this photo?

1:05:44.041 --> 1:05:46.643
I don't reveal my sources.
Hopefully you don't, either.

1:05:46.676 --> 1:05:49.679
Why are you giving me
this story,

1:05:49.713 --> 1:05:51.615
not the Post or the Times?

1:05:51.648 --> 1:05:54.118
We saw your article
on Darius Tanz.

1:05:54.151 --> 1:05:56.220
A face-to-face meeting
in the Treehouse.

1:05:56.253 --> 1:05:58.222
How did you get
that kind of access?

1:05:58.255 --> 1:06:00.991
Timing... and skill.

1:06:01.025 --> 1:06:04.294
Use that skill to find out what
the Pentagon and Tanz are up to,

1:06:04.328 --> 1:06:08.265
and you won't be a blogger with
a second-rate website anymore.

1:06:08.298 --> 1:06:11.001
You'll be the future
of investigative journalism.

1:06:11.035 --> 1:06:12.669
And what do you get out of it?

1:06:12.702 --> 1:06:14.504
The truth.

1:06:16.440 --> 1:06:18.375
Okay, Mom, I will.
Love you, too.

1:06:24.614 --> 1:06:26.450
If the U.S. and India
were both hacked,

1:06:26.483 --> 1:06:28.218
what are the chances
the others are in the clear?

1:06:28.252 --> 1:06:30.087
Well, we can't very well
call up Iran and China

1:06:30.120 --> 1:06:32.522
for a chat about
deep-space probes.

1:06:33.557 --> 1:06:34.591
Dexter,

1:06:34.624 --> 1:06:36.126
see if there's
any intelligence

1:06:36.160 --> 1:06:37.594
about the probes
out near the IO.

1:06:37.627 --> 1:06:39.096
Yes, sir.

1:06:42.399 --> 1:06:43.633
Sir, the Chinese probe
just crashed

1:06:43.667 --> 1:06:45.369
into Jupiter's moon Europa.

1:06:45.402 --> 1:06:47.337
And we picked up chatter
about the Iranian probe

1:06:47.371 --> 1:06:49.106
going off-line a few hours ago.

1:06:49.139 --> 1:06:53.777
It's not just us or India,
it's all of them.

1:06:53.810 --> 1:06:55.679
There is a major
player out there

1:06:55.712 --> 1:06:58.082
looking to get control
of that asteroid.

1:06:58.115 --> 1:06:59.583
And the fate of
the human race.

1:06:59.616 --> 1:07:00.450
TANZ:
Harris.

1:07:00.484 --> 1:07:03.553
We need the use of
your satellites now.

1:07:09.293 --> 1:07:10.794
MASON:
Black with a little sugar.

1:07:10.827 --> 1:07:13.530
Thanks.

1:07:13.563 --> 1:07:17.067
Has this happened before?
A lockdown?

1:07:17.101 --> 1:07:18.568
Once.

1:07:18.602 --> 1:07:22.239
Seven years ago, when some
drone technology was stolen.

1:07:22.272 --> 1:07:25.109
That's when Darius
brought in Lazlo.

1:07:25.142 --> 1:07:27.111
Who killed himself.

1:07:27.144 --> 1:07:30.380
The rumor is he was...

1:07:30.414 --> 1:07:31.681
stealing from the boss.

1:07:31.715 --> 1:07:33.417
We work in tech.

1:07:33.450 --> 1:07:35.319
There's lots of secrets running
around inside these walls.

1:07:35.352 --> 1:07:37.187
JAMIE: I had this one cousin,
he worked at

1:07:37.221 --> 1:07:39.289
an aeronautics start-up
in Silicon Valley.

1:07:39.323 --> 1:07:42.659
He was told day one he'd
given up all rights to privacy.

1:07:47.664 --> 1:07:50.500
Sorry. I can't get
ahold of Liam,

1:07:50.534 --> 1:07:53.270
and his work space
is empty.

1:07:53.303 --> 1:07:56.573
He just vanished, and...
he's not answering his phone.

1:07:56.606 --> 1:07:57.841
I had this other cousin,

1:07:57.874 --> 1:07:59.443
he'd thought he'd paid
his phone bill...

1:07:59.476 --> 1:08:01.878
I'm sure that Liam paid
his phone bill, Jamie.

1:08:01.911 --> 1:08:04.648
TESS: Security measures
have been completed.

1:08:04.681 --> 1:08:07.517
All employees must return
to their workstations.

1:08:07.551 --> 1:08:09.619
Thank you for your patience.
Let's get back at it.

1:08:18.228 --> 1:08:20.230
(panting softly)

1:08:27.237 --> 1:08:28.505
(grunts)

1:08:41.318 --> 1:08:42.886
(panting)

1:08:44.788 --> 1:08:46.423
CROFT:
Liam!

1:08:46.456 --> 1:08:49.593
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

1:08:59.936 --> 1:09:01.771
Really?

1:09:01.805 --> 1:09:04.374
You're gonna shoot me, Croft?

1:09:04.408 --> 1:09:06.276
After everything we've been
through, you're gonna shoot me?

1:09:06.310 --> 1:09:08.178
I don't want to.
I don't want to.

1:09:08.212 --> 1:09:09.813
But I will if I have to.

1:09:12.516 --> 1:09:14.818
You killed Lazlo.

1:09:14.851 --> 1:09:17.921
CROFT:
You wanted to see me?

1:09:17.954 --> 1:09:20.190
I thought maybe you could
explain what you're doing here

1:09:20.224 --> 1:09:22.292
on this video.
Let me see that.

1:09:23.827 --> 1:09:25.662
(Lazlo grunts, gunshot)

1:09:25.695 --> 1:09:27.597
I don't believe it.

1:09:27.631 --> 1:09:29.266
All of this is for money?

1:09:29.299 --> 1:09:31.935
No, no, no. Respect.

1:09:31.968 --> 1:09:35.872
I've watched lesser minds
like Darius Tanz make billions

1:09:35.905 --> 1:09:38.808
off of other people's ideas,
while people like you and I,

1:09:38.842 --> 1:09:40.710
we toil in obscurity.

1:09:40.744 --> 1:09:42.946
With the EmDrive, finally,

1:09:42.979 --> 1:09:46.450
this is my chance to join
the ranks of-of Oppenheimer,

1:09:46.483 --> 1:09:48.818
Einstein, Galileo.

1:09:48.852 --> 1:09:51.621
And I'm asking you
to come along with me.

1:09:51.655 --> 1:09:53.290
Liam, I'm offering you

1:09:53.323 --> 1:09:56.726
a chance for
scientific immortality.

1:09:58.728 --> 1:10:01.865
Croft, I would rather die a hero
than live a traitor.

1:10:10.474 --> 1:10:11.508
(panting)

1:10:14.878 --> 1:10:15.912
Croft?

1:10:15.945 --> 1:10:17.747
(gun cocks)
CROFT: Drop it.

1:10:20.350 --> 1:10:22.586
I already told you, Ms. Neel,
Darius is not here.

1:10:22.619 --> 1:10:24.321
Okay, fine.

1:10:24.354 --> 1:10:26.390
What about Liam Cole?
Is he here?

1:10:26.423 --> 1:10:28.725
He's not, but I'll be happy
to pass along a message.

1:10:28.758 --> 1:10:30.760
Thank you, I'd appreciate that.

1:10:32.929 --> 1:10:34.331
You're a friend of Liam's?

1:10:34.364 --> 1:10:36.400
Yeah.

1:10:36.433 --> 1:10:37.867
I am.

1:10:37.901 --> 1:10:38.935
Amanda.

1:10:38.968 --> 1:10:40.270
Jillian.

1:10:40.304 --> 1:10:41.271
His girlfriend, right?

1:10:41.305 --> 1:10:43.340
He talks about you all the time.

1:10:43.373 --> 1:10:44.708
Oh. (chuckles)

1:10:44.741 --> 1:10:45.942
Have you heard from him today?

1:10:45.975 --> 1:10:47.544
'Cause I've been
trying to reach him.

1:10:47.577 --> 1:10:49.245
No, I haven't.

1:10:50.914 --> 1:10:52.048
Are you okay?

1:10:52.081 --> 1:10:54.351
Yeah. I don't know.

1:10:54.384 --> 1:10:55.819
It's been an interesting day.

1:10:55.852 --> 1:10:57.887
You look like
you could use a drink.

1:10:57.921 --> 1:11:00.557
Actually...

1:11:00.590 --> 1:11:01.891
I really could.

1:11:01.925 --> 1:11:03.793
Come on. First round's on me.

1:11:03.827 --> 1:11:05.929
(chuckles)

1:11:05.962 --> 1:11:09.533
DEXTER: Satellite imaging shows
Liam and Professor Croft

1:11:09.566 --> 1:11:11.468
being transferred to
an SUV three hours ago.

1:11:11.501 --> 1:11:13.737
We tracked the SUV

1:11:13.770 --> 1:11:14.671
for 30 miles north-northwest

1:11:14.704 --> 1:11:16.506
before the satellite
moved out of range.

1:11:16.540 --> 1:11:18.775
You sure you can't
pick them up somewhere?

1:11:18.808 --> 1:11:21.010
We hooked into traffic cams,
but they left the grid

1:11:21.044 --> 1:11:22.111
over an hour ago;
the trail is cold.

1:11:22.145 --> 1:11:25.014
HARRIS: Okay, we have
the SUV's license plate number.

1:11:25.048 --> 1:11:26.616
Let's put out an APB.

1:11:26.650 --> 1:11:27.651
We don't have time for that.

1:11:27.684 --> 1:11:28.985
Dexter, we have
the license plate.

1:11:29.018 --> 1:11:31.355
Can you get the VIN number
from the DMV?

1:11:31.388 --> 1:11:33.323
Sure.
Excuse me,
you're not in charge here.

1:11:33.357 --> 1:11:35.392
Tanz Electronics

1:11:35.425 --> 1:11:36.793
built the onboard nav

1:11:36.826 --> 1:11:38.695
entertainment systems
for all those SUVs.

1:11:38.728 --> 1:11:40.830
In case of emergency...
You'd be able to track them.

1:11:40.864 --> 1:11:41.831
DEXTER: I have the VIN.
I just need your security code

1:11:41.865 --> 1:11:44.834
to get into the Tanz Electronics
control system.

1:11:44.868 --> 1:11:46.636
And there's a complicated
firewall here.

1:11:46.670 --> 1:11:48.772
Hold on, that's a root-level
access terminal.

1:11:48.805 --> 1:11:51.107
HARRIS: Darius, keep your
hands off that keyboard.

1:11:51.140 --> 1:11:52.809
You don't have clearance.
There's 20 steps here, Harris.

1:11:52.842 --> 1:11:55.345
The amount of time it would take
me to explain it to Dexter...

1:11:55.379 --> 1:11:56.646
CLAIRE:
Isn't it a little convenient

1:11:56.680 --> 1:11:58.382
that the EmDrive was lost
in the exact moment

1:11:58.415 --> 1:11:59.483
when you claim
it's finally working?

1:11:59.516 --> 1:12:01.718
It wasn't lost, Ms. Rayburn!

1:12:01.751 --> 1:12:04.654
It's been stolen
because it works.

1:12:04.688 --> 1:12:06.523
Stolen by the same man
who hacked the IO Probe.

1:12:06.556 --> 1:12:07.724
Why should we believe you?

1:12:07.757 --> 1:12:08.925
Damn it, because it's the truth.

1:12:08.958 --> 1:12:11.361
Lazlo was innocent. Darius has
done everything he promised.

1:12:11.395 --> 1:12:14.130
He invented planet-saving
technology in record time,

1:12:14.163 --> 1:12:16.833
which we are perilously
close to losing.

1:12:16.866 --> 1:12:18.635
Don't you think it's time

1:12:18.668 --> 1:12:20.103
we stopped treating him
like the enemy?

1:12:21.170 --> 1:12:22.105
Ms. Barrows...

1:12:22.138 --> 1:12:24.140
No, she's right.

1:12:24.173 --> 1:12:26.643
Have at it.

1:12:29.879 --> 1:12:31.581
TANZ:
This isn't exactly legal,

1:12:31.615 --> 1:12:34.751
but, then again, neither is
waterboarding your own citizens,

1:12:34.784 --> 1:12:37.921
so... I won't tell...

1:12:37.954 --> 1:12:39.956
if you don't.

1:12:45.795 --> 1:12:47.631
DEXTER:
Got him.

1:12:47.664 --> 1:12:49.032
Sir, they're at a private
airfield in Maryland.

1:12:49.065 --> 1:12:50.800
They can take off without
FAA authorization from there.

1:12:50.834 --> 1:12:52.802
Okay, scramble jets
to that location

1:12:52.836 --> 1:12:54.904
and close the airspace
out to international waters.

1:12:54.938 --> 1:12:57.674
We need to mobilize
an anti-terror team now.

1:12:57.707 --> 1:12:58.908
Where are you going?

1:12:58.942 --> 1:13:01.645
I have a chopper standing by.
You coming or not?

1:13:02.812 --> 1:13:04.113
Yes.

1:13:09.653 --> 1:13:12.088
All right, Liam, this
has gone far enough.

1:13:12.121 --> 1:13:13.490
Leave me alone!

1:13:13.523 --> 1:13:14.891
Take everything and go!

1:13:14.924 --> 1:13:16.826
There's only one other
person beside myself

1:13:16.860 --> 1:13:18.562
that can build an EmDrive.

1:13:18.595 --> 1:13:20.430
Now, what kind of
scientist would I be

1:13:20.464 --> 1:13:22.799
if I left a variable like
that on the table, huh?

1:13:22.832 --> 1:13:25.101
Now,

1:13:25.134 --> 1:13:28.004
I'm giving you
one last chance.

1:13:28.037 --> 1:13:30.574
I don't want to kill you.

1:13:30.607 --> 1:13:32.442
But I will if I have to.

1:13:32.476 --> 1:13:34.644
So, come on.

1:13:47.757 --> 1:13:50.927
So, you must love it,
getting to work for Darius Tanz.

1:13:50.960 --> 1:13:52.762
And with
your boyfriend there, too.

1:13:52.796 --> 1:13:56.666
Yeah, it's great...
when he's there.

1:13:56.700 --> 1:13:58.502
Meaning?

1:13:58.535 --> 1:14:01.905
He disappears. A lot.

1:14:01.938 --> 1:14:03.573
To where?

1:14:03.607 --> 1:14:06.009
Who knows? It's like...

1:14:06.042 --> 1:14:07.611
vanishes like Houdini.

1:14:07.644 --> 1:14:09.946
Just everything is so
secretive over there.

1:14:09.979 --> 1:14:12.849
You make it sound so sinister.

1:14:12.882 --> 1:14:15.552
I don't mean to.

1:14:15.585 --> 1:14:17.987
Working there is an honor.

1:14:18.021 --> 1:14:19.556
I know that.

1:14:19.589 --> 1:14:21.224
We're improving
the future of humanity.

1:14:22.892 --> 1:14:24.093
But...?

1:14:24.127 --> 1:14:25.128
Ugh, ignore me.

1:14:25.161 --> 1:14:27.664
I think that I have had
one martini too many.

1:14:27.697 --> 1:14:29.733
(both chuckle)
Listen,

1:14:29.766 --> 1:14:33.870
you're in a new city,
new boyfriend.

1:14:33.903 --> 1:14:36.272
You're feeling isolated;
I get that.

1:14:36.305 --> 1:14:38.842
And working for Darius Tanz
can't be easy.

1:14:40.610 --> 1:14:43.279
If you ever need a friend
to talk to, I'm here.

1:14:43.312 --> 1:14:46.282
Ah, you know, you're
the first friend I made

1:14:46.315 --> 1:14:48.017
since I moved
to Washington.

1:14:48.051 --> 1:14:51.254
Well... to friendship.

1:14:51.287 --> 1:14:52.989
To friendship.

1:14:53.022 --> 1:14:55.024
*

1:15:04.200 --> 1:15:06.202
(jet engine whirring)

1:15:07.303 --> 1:15:09.072
(gun cocks)

1:15:43.973 --> 1:15:45.174
(tires screech)

1:15:46.776 --> 1:15:48.812
You got to stop the plane!
Drop your weapon!

1:15:48.845 --> 1:15:49.713
No, no, no, don't shoot,
don't shoot!

1:15:49.746 --> 1:15:51.214
Get your hands up!
My name is Liam Cole!

1:15:51.247 --> 1:15:52.949
I work with Darius Tanz!

1:15:52.982 --> 1:15:54.818
Please don't shoot.
TANZ: Hold your fire!

1:15:54.851 --> 1:15:57.120
Hold your fire! He's with us!

1:15:57.153 --> 1:15:58.354
Are you okay?

1:15:58.387 --> 1:15:59.889
It was Croft.

1:15:59.923 --> 1:16:01.257
That son of a bitch.
They took everything.

1:16:01.290 --> 1:16:04.027
They took the research,
they took the prototype.

1:16:04.060 --> 1:16:05.361
Everything.
Who?

1:16:05.394 --> 1:16:06.663
The Russians.

1:16:16.640 --> 1:16:17.841
Understood.

1:16:21.645 --> 1:16:22.846
What?

1:16:22.879 --> 1:16:24.080
They can't find
the plane.

1:16:24.113 --> 1:16:27.316
They must've disabled
the transponder.

1:16:27.350 --> 1:16:29.085
And they're flying
below radar.

1:16:29.118 --> 1:16:31.688
Over water in the dark.

1:16:31.721 --> 1:16:33.089
Russia's in possession
of the EmDrive

1:16:33.122 --> 1:16:35.291
and all the kinetic impactors.

1:16:35.324 --> 1:16:36.693
Now what?

1:16:36.726 --> 1:16:38.127
(exhales)

1:16:38.161 --> 1:16:40.697
I...

1:16:40.730 --> 1:16:42.666
When the asteroid
gets close enough, we...

1:16:42.699 --> 1:16:45.635
use nuclear
weapons and...

1:16:45.669 --> 1:16:47.003
(exhales)

1:16:47.036 --> 1:16:48.638
...hope for the best.

1:16:48.672 --> 1:16:51.207
By then, everyone will know.

1:16:51.240 --> 1:16:53.242
It'll be chaos.

1:16:53.276 --> 1:16:54.744
Anarchy.

1:16:56.813 --> 1:16:58.948
We need to inform POTUS.

1:16:58.982 --> 1:17:01.050
To prepare for the worst.

1:17:01.084 --> 1:17:03.920
Harris...

1:17:03.953 --> 1:17:06.990
do you think Atlas
is responsible for all this?

1:17:11.695 --> 1:17:13.362
Let's hope not.

1:17:18.334 --> 1:17:22.338
So, did you get the answers
to your questions?

1:17:23.472 --> 1:17:25.374
Some.

1:17:27.376 --> 1:17:31.681
Tess... was the love of my life.

1:17:31.715 --> 1:17:35.451
I broke her heart and,
as it turns out, my own.

1:17:35.484 --> 1:17:37.020
She's my biggest regret,

1:17:37.053 --> 1:17:40.323
and now Lazlo.

1:17:40.356 --> 1:17:42.225
I'm sorry.

1:17:42.258 --> 1:17:46.963
(sighs) How could I
have been so stupid?

1:17:46.996 --> 1:17:48.431
Croft--

1:17:48.464 --> 1:17:51.100
he's the only person I haven't
vetted in all the years

1:17:51.134 --> 1:17:52.335
I've let people
through these doors.

1:17:52.368 --> 1:17:53.402
Darius,

1:17:53.436 --> 1:17:56.205
no one can see everything
coming, not even you.

1:17:56.239 --> 1:17:59.843
He wiped my internal
hard drives clean.

1:17:59.876 --> 1:18:01.845
(chuckles)
There's no evidence

1:18:01.878 --> 1:18:05.248
we ever worked on
the EmDrive at Tanz.

1:18:05.281 --> 1:18:08.952
If you believed so strongly
in the EmDrive,

1:18:08.985 --> 1:18:11.054
why'd you make me steal
uranium for the ark?

1:18:12.789 --> 1:18:14.690
Play the game out till the end.

1:18:16.225 --> 1:18:18.294
Now that the Russians
have the EmDrive,

1:18:18.327 --> 1:18:20.063
the Americans
will challenge them.

1:18:20.096 --> 1:18:21.430
It will lead to a stand-off.

1:18:21.464 --> 1:18:24.901
That uranium you risked
everything for

1:18:24.934 --> 1:18:26.870
will power the ark's
life support functions,

1:18:26.903 --> 1:18:28.838
and your selfless bravery

1:18:28.872 --> 1:18:32.341
will be the only reason
any of us live on.

1:18:32.375 --> 1:18:34.010
You think
we're gonna kill ourselves

1:18:34.043 --> 1:18:36.179
before the asteroid
even gets here.

1:18:37.513 --> 1:18:39.883
Whoever controls
the EmDrive

1:18:39.916 --> 1:18:41.484
controls the fate
of the world, Grace.

1:18:41.517 --> 1:18:44.287
And right now,
it's in the hands of our enemy.

1:18:44.320 --> 1:18:46.990
We have no idea what they'll do
with that power.

1:18:47.023 --> 1:18:48.758
Save us...

1:18:48.792 --> 1:18:50.193
or destroy us.

1:18:53.096 --> 1:18:55.098
*

1:19:13.116 --> 1:19:18.021
* On the edge of the dark

1:19:18.054 --> 1:19:23.159
* I wait for the sun to rise

1:19:23.192 --> 1:19:28.064
* Oh, there's still
a little light that shines... *

1:19:29.332 --> 1:19:30.499
Liam?

1:19:30.533 --> 1:19:36.005
* In my tired eyes...

1:19:36.039 --> 1:19:40.009
I didn't mean
to wake you up.

1:19:40.043 --> 1:19:43.913
Where have you been?

1:19:43.947 --> 1:19:45.181
Um... research.

1:19:45.214 --> 1:19:46.916
Off-campus.

1:19:46.950 --> 1:19:51.354
* 'Cause there's still
a little light that shines... *

1:19:52.588 --> 1:19:56.059
Couldn't reach you all day.

1:19:56.092 --> 1:19:57.593
I thought you were dead
or something.

1:19:57.626 --> 1:19:59.428
* Eyes

1:20:00.563 --> 1:20:02.565
*

1:20:06.970 --> 1:20:08.237
(Liam sniffles)

1:20:23.352 --> 1:20:24.487
I'm not dead.

1:20:24.520 --> 1:20:28.224
* On the edge of the dark

1:20:28.257 --> 1:20:33.429
* I will wait for the sun
to rise *

1:20:33.462 --> 1:20:36.099
* 'Cause there's still
a little... *

1:20:36.132 --> 1:20:38.101
I'm right here.

1:20:40.669 --> 1:20:42.371
* Deep in my tired eyes.
