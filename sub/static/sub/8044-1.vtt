01:20.459 --> 01:22.542
(Clarence) I'll be there in a minute.

01:24.876 --> 01:27.251

(Car doors slam)

01:39.501 --> 01:42.667
- Clarence, they're waiting!
- I'm coming. I'm coming.

01:45.292 --> 01:48.042
(Baby continues crying)

02:27.001 --> 02:28.626
(Clattering)

02:32.209 --> 02:35.792
Clarence, could it be him?

02:37.334 --> 02:41.876
No. It was probably just those punks that
broke in Tibbits' house last Halloween.

03:24.126 --> 03:26.209
(Door creaks)

03:51.542 --> 03:53.126
(Screams)

03:58.334 --> 04:00.334
What do you want?

04:00.417 --> 04:03.084
(Demonic voice) I want the skull.

04:03.959 --> 04:05.501
I don't know where it is.

04:09.251 --> 04:10.626
It's not here.

04:16.125 --> 04:17.041
(Gunshot)

04:17.125 --> 04:18.500
(Screams)

04:33.167 --> 04:36.834
Give me the skull.

04:39.042 --> 04:40.417
(Screaming)

04:40.501 --> 04:42.084
(Gunshot)

04:56.001 --> 04:57.584
Wow.

04:58.667 --> 05:00.167
I don't believe it.

05:03.167 --> 05:06.126
- Wow! It's big, isn't it?
- Yep.

05:09.001 --> 05:11.001
It's definitely not built to code.

05:17.376 --> 05:20.126
(Woman) How many generations
of your family lived here?

05:20.209 --> 05:22.084
(Man) I don't know.

05:23.626 --> 05:26.209
(Door creaking)

05:52.042 --> 05:54.334
Who decorated this place?

06:00.917 --> 06:02.126
Wow.

06:19.667 --> 06:21.667
Looks like something's missing.

06:31.667 --> 06:34.876
Great... I thought the electricity
was supposed to be on, Jesse.

06:34.959 --> 06:37.751
Yeah, it is.
The switch must be out.

06:39.292 --> 06:41.501
Is there a phone in here?

06:45.292 --> 06:46.751
Great.

06:47.667 --> 06:49.542
(Phone dialing)

06:50.126 --> 06:52.084
(Kate) John Statman, please.

06:52.167 --> 06:54.626
- 'Hello.'
- John, hi. It's Kate.

06:54.709 --> 06:56.626
- 'Hey.'
- Sorry I couldn't call you earlier.

06:56.709 --> 06:59.542
- The car phone doesn't work out here.
- What's the house like?

06:59.626 --> 07:03.167
Well, it's a pit,
but Jesse's completely in love with it.

07:03.251 --> 07:04.626
(John laughing)

07:04.709 --> 07:08.042
(Kate, laughing) How did the meeting go?
Is he interested?

07:08.126 --> 07:09.042
No?

07:09.126 --> 07:12.959
Great! We could have had him recording
in the studio by early next month.

07:13.042 --> 07:15.834
- 'What should we do?
- We've got to find somebody fast.

07:15.917 --> 07:19.126
Did you go see that new band
down at the Miner's Club?

07:19.209 --> 07:22.126
Raw indie, don't you think?

07:22.209 --> 07:24.751
You're absolutely right.
Hey did you get that letter from...?

07:24.834 --> 07:27.334
(Jessie) I don't believe it.

07:27.417 --> 07:29.334
That's my mom and dad.

07:30.042 --> 07:32.042
Hey, I was pretty cute.

07:32.834 --> 07:34.959
(Kate continues chattering)

07:38.501 --> 07:40.501
That was my grandfather.

07:42.667 --> 07:47.667
So he must have been
my great-great-grandfather,

07:48.626 --> 07:51.459
Jesse McLaughlin.
They named me after him.

(Jesse groaning)

09:15.167 --> 09:17.334
What on earth were you doing?

09:17.417 --> 09:22.126
I couldn't sleep, so I went downstairs
to just look around.

09:24.959 --> 09:27.084

09:38.292 --> 09:40.292

- Hey, this is cool.

13:01.834 --> 13:04.126

- Come on Charlie, give it.

Fine. See this guy?

13:20.917 --> 13:24.292
It's my great-great-grandfather.
He has the same name as me.

13:24.376 --> 13:26.917
He was an outlaw in the old west.

13:27.001 --> 13:30.376
- OK, I can buy that.
- Yeah, look at this skull he's holding.

13:30.459 --> 13:32.709
It's made completely out of raw crystal.

13:33.626 --> 13:37.584
And this guy in the background,
this is Jesse's partner Slim Reeser.

13:37.667 --> 13:41.126
Now, he and Jesse had a
falling out over the skull

13:41.209 --> 13:43.459
and became bitter enemies.

13:43.542 --> 13:46.584
Slim died without ever
getting the skull from Jesse.

13:47.792 --> 13:50.126
Now, look at this. See this skull?

13:50.209 --> 13:52.667
And now it's different from
the one here in the book, right?

13:52.751 --> 13:54.751
I mean this one has
got jewels in the eyes.

13:54.834 --> 13:58.501
- Wait, wait a minute.
- But, listen to this. OK.

13:58.584 --> 14:00.167
Um, all right.

14:00.251 --> 14:02.251
Legend has it, that there was
a second skull

14:02.334 --> 14:05.376
that had untold powers that could unlock
the mysteries of the universe

14:05.459 --> 14:08.167
and bring eternal life
to those who possessed it.

14:08.251 --> 14:10.917
So, question is

14:11.001 --> 14:18.751
if this is the legendary
second skull, where is it?

14:21.709 --> 14:24.917
Uh, why you asking me?
I mean, how am I supposed to know?

14:25.001 --> 14:30.584
Charlie, Charlie, um...
there's an old cemetery up on the hill.

14:30.667 --> 14:33.501
Jesse was buried there in 1916.

14:33.584 --> 14:38.209
But look here. It says, that when the
Aztecs buried their dead

14:38.292 --> 14:40.334
they wrapped the bodies
in several layers of cloth

14:40.417 --> 14:45.626
and they surrounded them
with their weapons and jewels.

14:45.709 --> 14:48.876
It was worth millions? Was it a lot?

14:54.126 --> 14:57.001
I say, let's go for it.

15:05.709 --> 15:07.876
There's nothing down here.

15:08.834 --> 15:10.209
Let's quit.

15:10.292 --> 15:13.834
I don't care if all the money
in the world is down here.

15:13.917 --> 15:17.251
I just want some sleep.
I'm really tired.

15:19.042 --> 15:20.626
(Thud)

15:28.084 --> 15:30.001
- (Whispers) Charlie.
- Huh?

15:30.084 --> 15:32.584
- We got it.
- Oh, no.

15:32.667 --> 15:33.959
No.

15:36.751 --> 15:38.459
(Grunting)

15:41.959 --> 15:44.209
- You got it, Charlie?
- Yeah.

15:50.417 --> 15:55.792
I give up. I can't feel anything.
Please, let me die.

15:56.417 --> 15:58.876
Please, let me die.

16:38.542 --> 16:40.751
(Gasping) Charlie.

16:41.876 --> 16:44.334
Jess, what?

16:44.417 --> 16:45.876
Come on.

16:45.959 --> 16:48.751
I don't have time for this, Jess.
What's in there?

16:48.834 --> 16:50.292
Charlie!

16:54.334 --> 16:56.126

17:29.126 --> 17:31.417
Oh, oh, oh, Jesse!

17:34.376 --> 17:36.459
It's me.

17:36.542 --> 17:39.376
- I'm your great-great-grandson.
- Huh?

17:39.459 --> 17:42.459
They named me after you.
My name is Jesse, too.

17:42.542 --> 17:44.334
Huh?

17:58.209 --> 18:01.292
My-great-great-grandson?

18:05.251 --> 18:09.501
- What year is it?
- I don't know.

18:09.584 --> 18:11.626
Now, don't you mess with me, boy.

18:11.709 --> 18:13.376
Uh, 1986.

18:13.459 --> 18:16.667
It's October 30th, 1986.

18:16.751 --> 18:19.334
(Laughing) Well!

18:19.417 --> 18:22.126
Goddamn.

18:22.209 --> 18:24.876
You know I've been waiting
over 70 years for some jackass

18:24.959 --> 18:27.959
to get the sense to come dig me up.

18:29.167 --> 18:30.542
Thank you, boy.

18:42.667 --> 18:44.209
Well.

18:45.126 --> 18:46.417
There she is.

18:47.292 --> 18:50.751
There is something special
about this old house.

18:50.834 --> 18:53.959
Can't you feel it? I can.

18:55.084 --> 18:57.709
(Door creaking)

19:01.584 --> 19:03.501
Come on.

19:04.126 --> 19:05.667
Let's go this way.

19:14.209 --> 19:16.209
(Jesse) Where you going?

19:19.667 --> 19:21.542
(Jesse Snr) There.

19:34.709 --> 19:39.042
Remember boys,
this house is a temple,

19:39.126 --> 19:44.417
as fantastic as any pyramid
or castle you'll ever see.

19:44.501 --> 19:49.126
It don't know time
or space or any of that hogwash,

19:49.209 --> 19:52.126
but the forces of evil
are always after this skull

19:52.209 --> 19:54.459
and you've got to
help me to protect it.

19:54.542 --> 19:57.876
So don't let no one touch
the dang thing, ya hear?

20:10.459 --> 20:11.834
Here.

20:11.917 --> 20:14.459
You can sleep on this.

20:14.542 --> 20:17.626
Is this the way you treat family?

20:17.709 --> 20:22.834
Making him hide down in the basement
like some slimy old lizard?

20:22.917 --> 20:25.667
Well, I'm sorry.
I must be out of practice.

20:25.751 --> 20:28.501
- I don't have any family, sir.
- Don't call me sir.

20:28.584 --> 20:30.334
I ain't no politician.

20:30.417 --> 20:35.334
Heck, I'm your great-great-grandfather.

20:36.001 --> 20:37.626
You can call me Gramps.

20:37.709 --> 20:40.917
That's what your
granddaddy used to call me.

20:42.042 --> 20:44.042
All right. Gramps.

20:47.042 --> 20:48.001
Well.

20:48.084 --> 20:53.126
- Uh, we better hit the hay.
- But I'm not tired.

20:54.376 --> 20:56.417
I don't need no sleep.

20:56.501 --> 21:00.126
Well, let's get me cleaned up
and then we go out on the town

21:00.209 --> 21:02.167
and do a little high steppin'.

21:03.417 --> 21:07.042
- I don't know if that's such a good idea.
- Why not?

21:07.126 --> 21:12.042
- There's nothing wrong with me.
- No. There's nothing wrong with you.

21:13.917 --> 21:17.334
Yeah, well something is bothering you.
I can see it in your eyes.

21:18.542 --> 21:21.501
Look, I'm just as fit as a fiddle. I'm...

21:25.751 --> 21:28.417

21:29.292 --> 21:31.126
(Crying) Oh, no.

21:32.209 --> 21:33.334
Oh, no.

21:33.417 --> 21:37.459
I'm supposed to be young again.

21:41.209 --> 21:43.501
Gramps, maybe you should...

21:44.751 --> 21:46.709
(Crying) Look at me.

21:50.834 --> 21:55.917
I'm a 170-year-old fart.

21:57.042 --> 21:59.709
A goddamn zombie.

22:01.334 --> 22:06.126
Well, you look really good for a
170-year-old zombie, Gramps, really great.

22:10.376 --> 22:14.209
I ain't gonna die,
if it's the last thing I do.

22:51.917 --> 22:53.834
(Sighs)

23:07.209 --> 23:09.792
What in tarnation is it?

23:09.876 --> 23:15.542
Gramps,
this is a 1986 Alfa Romeo Spider.

23:17.834 --> 23:20.542
Zero to 60 in 7.3 seconds.

23:35.751 --> 23:38.292
(Engine revving)

23:41.792 --> 23:43.126
Let it out slow.

23:43.209 --> 23:45.917
There you go, real slow.

23:46.209 --> 23:48.542
(Tires screeching)

23:49.417 --> 23:51.459
Charlie!

23:52.584 --> 23:55.334
(Gramps) Yee-haw!

23:56.334 --> 23:58.501
(Tires screeching)

24:03.334 --> 24:04.917
(Laughing)

24:05.001 --> 24:07.751
- Will you look at them stars?
- Whew!

24:08.501 --> 24:14.084
You know, they were clearer
back in the old days.

24:14.167 --> 24:19.126
(Laughing) Sometimes they were so bright,
you couldn't get to sleep.

24:20.459 --> 24:23.834
Well you know, Gramps, it's the ozone.

24:23.917 --> 24:24.959
I mean.

24:25.042 --> 24:28.209
(Laughing)
I mean, you know, insect repellents

24:28.292 --> 24:31.084
you know, under arm deodorants,

24:31.167 --> 24:35.751
maybe just a pinch of communism
is making the stars fade away.

24:35.834 --> 24:38.376
You're drunk!
(Charlie laughs)

24:45.042 --> 24:46.501
Whoa!

24:46.584 --> 24:48.792
(Laughter)

24:54.626 --> 24:56.292
I'd better drive.

24:57.626 --> 24:59.126
(Tires screeching)

25:11.084 --> 25:12.834
(Laughter)

25:17.792 --> 25:19.709
(Gramps laughing)

25:30.459 --> 25:31.917
Charlie?

25:34.709 --> 25:36.251
(Doorbell)

25:39.876 --> 25:42.792
Jesse, you old golf bag, how are you?

25:42.876 --> 25:45.626
John, what are you doing here?

25:46.292 --> 25:49.959
Oh, well, your beautiful lady informed me
that she's found the Madonna of the '80s.

25:50.042 --> 25:53.084
I thought I'd better come by
and check it out.

25:53.167 --> 25:56.501
Hey, I thought Madonna
was the Madonna of the '80s, huh?

25:56.584 --> 25:59.792
(Laughing) Very good.
Who's your friend, Bozo the clown?

25:59.876 --> 26:02.709
(Chuckles) No. Bozo the death machine.

26:02.792 --> 26:06.084
Charlie, Charlie,
this is John Statman, Kate's boss.

26:06.167 --> 26:09.876
He's the president of Heretic Records.

26:12.542 --> 26:14.251
OK.

26:15.334 --> 26:18.876
OK. OK, John Statman, of course, hi.

26:18.959 --> 26:20.876
This is really a pleasure.
I'm really happy to meet you.

26:20.959 --> 26:24.459
Charlie Coriel,
manager of "Puce Glitz and the Avoiders."

26:24.542 --> 26:26.626
- Kate!
- ♪ Tada!

26:26.709 --> 26:29.084
- Here she is.
- Great. You have the tape?

26:29.167 --> 26:30.792
- Where are you going?
- We're doing lunch.

26:30.876 --> 26:34.792
John made a special trip out here to meet
Lana and listen to her demo tape.

26:37.459 --> 26:38.709
See you later, Jesse.

26:39.917 --> 26:41.292
(Door closes)

26:41.376 --> 26:43.459
(TV blaring loudly)

26:43.542 --> 26:45.292
(Gramps) These are great!

26:45.376 --> 26:48.501
They just keep coming
and coming and coming.

26:48.584 --> 26:49.751
(He laughs)

26:49.834 --> 26:52.834
Where the hell they
all coming from anyhow?

26:55.251 --> 26:56.459
Damn!

26:56.542 --> 26:57.792
I broke it.

26:59.251 --> 27:01.459
- Have a brewski, Gramps.
- Thanks.

27:01.542 --> 27:04.709
I hate this doggone box

27:04.792 --> 27:11.167
Got all them channels
and got nothing interesting to watch.

27:11.251 --> 27:14.917
(On TV) 'There I was, in the middle
of Kansas facing 500 crazy fanatics

27:15.001 --> 27:17.501
'and me with only 15 soldiers...'

27:17.584 --> 27:23.417
Now you take this Ronald Reagan
fellow, he sure is a pansy.

27:23.501 --> 27:27.542
He wouldn't have lasted
ten minutes back in the old days.

27:27.626 --> 27:33.626
'..There comes a time in every soldier's
life when he must stand or fall alone.'

27:34.542 --> 27:38.334
(Gramps) It wouldn't do no good to tell
you how it was. You had to be there.

27:39.251 --> 27:41.834
All them movies and books and crap,

27:41.917 --> 27:44.917
they don't tell you how it really was -
it was rough.

27:45.001 --> 27:49.126
I got a question for you.
Whatever happened to Slim Reeser?

27:52.792 --> 27:57.167
Slim Reeser ain't part of
my vocabulary no more, son.

27:59.042 --> 28:04.417
We had a disagreement about
who the skull belonged to.

28:05.459 --> 28:10.417
- What did you do?
- I shot the scallywag is what I did.

28:11.459 --> 28:15.084
Well, he took a shot at me first,
so I had to teach him a lesson.

28:15.709 --> 28:19.459
And I left him to die
in the Mojave Desert.

28:20.376 --> 28:21.959
And that was that?

28:22.042 --> 28:24.542
Yeah, well that was that.

28:26.209 --> 28:30.042
Gramps, did you ever rob a stagecoach?

28:31.834 --> 28:34.084
- (Laughing) Sure.
- All right!

28:34.167 --> 28:36.376
All the time.

28:36.459 --> 28:41.792
I robbed a stagecoach once
just outside of Dodge City.

28:41.876 --> 28:45.292
Now, every day at about 5:30,
it used to come into the bank

28:45.376 --> 28:49.334
with a bag of money that would
give an elephant a hernia.

28:49.417 --> 28:52.251
We set up on both
sides of a little gorge

28:52.334 --> 28:57.042
just outside of town and when
the stagecoach come on through...

28:57.126 --> 28:59.084
(Voice fades)

28:59.167 --> 29:01.751
...and they chased me around them hills

29:01.834 --> 29:06.167
and clean across the border
into Arizona territory,

29:06.251 --> 29:09.959
but I was riding for about two weeks
without ever getting out of the saddle,

29:10.042 --> 29:11.876
trying to lose them fellows.

29:11.959 --> 29:13.709
(Voice drifts off)

29:14.834 --> 29:17.876
...holding them off with just two pistols
and a Winchester.

29:17.959 --> 29:21.876
All of the sudden I take an arrow
right through the leg,

29:21.959 --> 29:25.917
right there and another one
in the shoulder, right there...

29:26.834 --> 29:29.751
...the cage was never uncovered again

29:29.834 --> 29:35.834
and there must've a billion dollars
in diamonds and jewels down there.

29:36.876 --> 29:39.417
Now that's something
I intend to search for,

29:39.501 --> 29:42.042
just as soon as I get rejuvenated.

29:42.126 --> 29:43.959
(♪ Pop music)

29:44.042 --> 29:46.709
- Shh.
- What?

29:46.792 --> 29:49.209
I hear something.

29:49.292 --> 29:51.584
Yeah, it sounds like music.

29:56.667 --> 30:00.292
- What time is it?
- Bring back some more beer.

30:00.376 --> 30:02.334
(♪ Pop music)

30:15.709 --> 30:18.709
- Hey, how's it going?
- Cool!

30:24.834 --> 30:27.959
I invited some people over for Halloween.

30:28.917 --> 30:30.334
I forgot!

30:32.501 --> 30:34.417
Sorry.

30:34.501 --> 30:36.459
Enjoy.

30:36.542 --> 30:38.709
Hey Smith, how you doing?

30:38.792 --> 30:40.459
Get over here.

30:43.667 --> 30:46.334
(♪ Music drowns out conversations)

30:56.542 --> 30:58.251
Guess who!

31:01.334 --> 31:04.292
- Rochelle!
- Long time, no see.

31:15.251 --> 31:17.751
It's been so long since I've seen you.

31:20.709 --> 31:23.792
Yeah, it sure has.

31:24.751 --> 31:27.084
Excuse me, we need to talk outside.

31:31.334 --> 31:35.417
- How long you out here for?
- Like a week.

31:35.501 --> 31:37.334
(Gramps howling)

31:47.667 --> 31:50.667
- Would you hold this trash for a minute?
- Sure.

31:50.751 --> 31:52.126
You look great.

31:54.751 --> 31:57.459
Now, I know some people
down in Hollywood...

31:57.542 --> 31:59.584
- (Jesse) Charlie. Charlie.
- What?

31:59.667 --> 32:02.376
Look. Gramps. What is he doing?

32:03.126 --> 32:07.501
- He looks like he's about to score.
- Yeah, but how did he get up here?

32:07.584 --> 32:11.126
Will you relax?
It's Halloween. He blends right in.

32:11.209 --> 32:14.542
All right, Gramps! Go for it, pal.

32:18.084 --> 32:20.084
Hey, excuse me. Hey Susan!

32:22.584 --> 32:28.084
- Isn't he great?
- Yeah, he's an old friend, from way back.

32:37.209 --> 32:40.042
(♪ Ominous music)

32:49.584 --> 32:51.542
(Deep growl)

33:02.959 --> 33:05.501
(Laughing and talking)

33:08.251 --> 33:10.709
Hey! Excuse me!

33:11.751 --> 33:13.001
Hey!

33:13.084 --> 33:15.959
- Hey, watch it.
- (Angry growling)

33:44.167 --> 33:46.251
- Jesse?
- Uh-huh.

33:46.334 --> 33:48.459
Um, can I talk to you?

33:52.292 --> 33:55.001
- Out in back?
- Sure.

33:55.084 --> 33:57.626
- I'll meet you there.
- Okey-dokey.

34:00.126 --> 34:03.084
(♪ Ominous music)

34:17.751 --> 34:19.083
Hey.

34:19.708 --> 34:23.708
You better pack your ass in a suitcase
and head for Panama.

34:23.792 --> 34:25.251
(Growling)

34:25.333 --> 34:26.833
You jerk!

34:28.001 --> 34:29.751
(Growling)

34:31.667 --> 34:35.001
I knew it was her all along! Stupid fool!

34:35.083 --> 34:37.376
Take it easy! No, wait. Please.

34:37.458 --> 34:39.458
(Kate screaming)

34:44.042 --> 34:45.833
(Thunder clap)

34:48.417 --> 34:50.708
No! Charlie, stop him.

34:51.958 --> 34:53.458
Hold it!

34:53.542 --> 34:55.292
(Roaring)

35:15.834 --> 35:17.959
(Jungle animals calling)

35:26.792 --> 35:29.084
Charlie, there's a jungle in there.

35:30.209 --> 35:32.917
- Can I get you something? Water?
- Valium, get me Valium.

35:37.167 --> 35:39.917
Whiskey, get me whiskey.

35:47.376 --> 35:49.376
I need the skull.

35:49.459 --> 35:53.709
Without it I'm a goner for sure.
Don't let him get away.

35:53.792 --> 35:58.792
- Gramps, there's a jungle upstairs.
- He took it in there.

35:59.626 --> 36:03.167
He's from the Stone Age, kid.
You've got to stop him.

36:03.251 --> 36:06.126
Don't worry, he's a pushover.

36:06.209 --> 36:08.876
Gramps, I don't think you understand.
There is a jungle...

36:08.959 --> 36:13.917
Jesse, in the wrong hands
that skull could cause trouble.

36:14.001 --> 36:15.542
Now, go!

36:17.334 --> 36:19.167
(♪ Ominous music)

36:23.917 --> 36:25.667
(Whispers) Charlie.

36:36.542 --> 36:38.334
(Knocks on door)

36:39.167 --> 36:40.417
Charlie.

36:40.501 --> 36:41.792
Ha!

36:42.876 --> 36:45.376
Charlie,
don't sneak up behind me like that.

36:45.459 --> 36:47.792
Well, I just happen to have this
in the trunk of the car.

36:47.876 --> 36:50.001
You never know when you're going
to need one in a pinch, huh?

36:50.084 --> 36:51.459
What is it?

36:51.542 --> 36:54.292
This is an Uzi,
semi-automatic firing weapon.

36:54.376 --> 36:57.959
- Charlie, this is a machine gun.
- So?

36:58.042 --> 36:59.792
So.

37:00.917 --> 37:04.209
So, what about me?
What do I get?

37:04.292 --> 37:10.667
Only had the one Uzi, you know,
but uh... I got one of these.

37:14.709 --> 37:19.251
- What do I do with this, light cigars?
- No, you shoot people with it.

37:19.334 --> 37:20.501
Duh.

37:22.251 --> 37:23.001
OK.

37:24.501 --> 37:27.459
On the count of three,
you're going to kick the door open,

37:27.542 --> 37:30.459
run in there blindly
and I'll cover you, OK?

37:30.542 --> 37:33.042
The guy with the big gun goes first.

37:35.459 --> 37:36.292
OK.

37:39.376 --> 37:41.334
- (Sighs) Ready?
- Yeah.

37:42.292 --> 37:45.126
(Both) One, two...

37:45.209 --> 37:46.417
Hold on.

37:50.376 --> 37:55.709
(Both) One, two, three.

37:56.334 --> 37:58.417
(Both yelling)

37:58.501 --> 37:59.876
(Rapid gunfire)

38:06.626 --> 38:09.292
(Animals squawking)

38:52.334 --> 38:54.334
(Creature squawks)

38:55.376 --> 38:59.626
- Ow! What are you doing?
- Making sure you're not dreaming.

39:24.584 --> 39:25.876
Charlie.

39:29.959 --> 39:33.584
Nobody's home. What do we do?
We need a plan.

39:35.209 --> 39:38.001
Yeah, let's get the skull
and get the hell out of here.

39:38.084 --> 39:39.792
Good plan.

39:56.209 --> 39:57.959
(Both laugh)

39:58.042 --> 39:59.459
(Growling)

40:09.084 --> 40:10.959
Thanks, Charlie.

40:14.334 --> 40:15.959
Gently, please!

40:25.626 --> 40:27.126
Take your best shot.

40:27.209 --> 40:28.417
(Growling)

40:46.334 --> 40:48.084

(Creature moves away)

40:59.042 --> 41:00.376
Huh?

41:07.917 --> 41:09.626
You coward!

41:10.126 --> 41:12.334
Come back and fight like a man!

41:32.917 --> 41:34.959
- Where did he go?
- He ran away.

41:35.042 --> 41:37.876
Tail between his legs!
Chicken shit barbarian.

41:38.584 --> 41:40.626
- Charlie, we got it.
- All right!

41:40.709 --> 41:44.126
The skull is ours!

41:44.209 --> 41:45.792
Woo-hoo! Yes!

41:48.376 --> 41:50.001
No! Oh no.

41:50.084 --> 41:51.584
(Rapid gun fire)

41:51.667 --> 41:55.417
- Come back. Wait!
- Hey Jesse, don't lose it!

42:09.292 --> 42:10.584
This one.

42:24.917 --> 42:26.751
Go on, hurry up.

42:26.834 --> 42:28.292
(Charlie chuckles)

42:31.876 --> 42:33.084
- Jesse.
- Yeah.

42:33.167 --> 42:35.792
Don't worry.
If you fall you'll die real fast.

42:36.334 --> 42:37.917
Thanks, Charlie(!)

43:15.792 --> 43:18.376
(Distant bird calls)

43:33.084 --> 43:37.042
You're doing great, Jesse!
Keep going! Ow!

43:37.126 --> 43:39.917
(Laughing) What an idiot.

43:42.876 --> 43:44.626
(Strains)

43:53.251 --> 43:54.917

Ow!

(Bird roars)

44:16.667 --> 44:20.417
(Charlie) Hey, Jesse, looking good.
Wish I had a camera!

44:27.292 --> 44:28.626
OK.

44:34.334 --> 44:36.417
Nice bird.

44:41.667 --> 44:43.126
Nice birdie.

44:43.209 --> 44:44.209
Jeez!

44:46.834 --> 44:49.001
(Snuffling, snorting)

44:55.209 --> 44:56.751
All right.

45:01.792 --> 45:03.709
Come on, Jesse.

45:12.292 --> 45:13.751
(Squawking)

45:24.459 --> 45:26.667
Jesse, a bird there! Look!

45:28.626 --> 45:31.459
Jesse, get out of there, come on.

45:31.542 --> 45:33.751
Come on, Jesse.

45:36.584 --> 45:38.751
Jesse, are you coming?

45:38.834 --> 45:41.084
Come on! Get down!

45:41.167 --> 45:42.626
Come on!

45:43.417 --> 45:45.126
(Jesse yelling) Catch me!

45:45.209 --> 45:46.376
Catch me!

45:46.459 --> 45:48.626
Charlie, catch me!

45:48.709 --> 45:51.376
I got it. I got ya, Jesse.

45:53.584 --> 45:56.542
(Both yelling)

45:56.626 --> 45:58.376
(Crashing)

46:03.251 --> 46:05.209
What the hell was that?

46:05.292 --> 46:08.459
It sounded like a bomb.

46:09.292 --> 46:11.209
Why didn't you use the stairs?

46:14.001 --> 46:15.751
Charlie.

46:15.834 --> 46:17.876
Charlie, you all right?

46:24.626 --> 46:27.126
(Snuffling, snorting)

46:32.417 --> 46:33.251
Agh!

46:33.334 --> 46:35.709
Get him off me! He's eating my leg!

46:36.292 --> 46:38.292
Get him off me.

46:38.376 --> 46:39.626
Jesse!

46:39.709 --> 46:41.709
He's eating me alive.

46:43.792 --> 46:46.084
(Whimpers)

46:46.167 --> 46:47.126
(Barks)

46:47.209 --> 46:48.667
(Whines)

46:48.751 --> 46:50.667
(Chuckling)

46:50.751 --> 46:52.876
- Charlie.
- (Charlie crying)

46:52.959 --> 46:55.251
- Charlie!
- He's...

46:56.417 --> 46:58.417
(Barking)

46:58.501 --> 46:59.626
(Gasps)

47:01.501 --> 47:02.667
Hey.

47:04.917 --> 47:07.459
Hey Jess, can we keep him?

47:07.542 --> 47:09.459
Well, who's going to
take care of him, Charlie?

47:09.542 --> 47:11.626
I'll feed him, change his water and stuff.

47:11.709 --> 47:13.584
(Growling)

47:14.501 --> 47:16.084
Charlie, help me.

47:17.792 --> 47:19.126
Charlie, help me.

47:19.209 --> 47:21.542
(Barking)

47:21.626 --> 47:23.626
And don't forget the beer.

47:24.459 --> 47:27.501
(Squawking)

47:40.626 --> 47:41.834
Come on.

47:43.126 --> 47:44.501
Come on.

47:44.584 --> 47:46.001
Come on.

47:51.834 --> 47:54.084
(Squealing)

47:57.126 --> 47:58.376
Get him.

47:58.459 --> 48:00.751
(Squealing)

48:07.084 --> 48:09.709
Hey, uh, Jesse?

48:09.792 --> 48:10.917
Damn!

48:14.501 --> 48:15.626
Charlie, hi.

48:15.709 --> 48:18.126
(Nervous laugh) Hi, John. Lana.

48:22.876 --> 48:24.542
(Jesse) Easy.

48:24.709 --> 48:25.917
Come on.

48:27.417 --> 48:31.126
Come on, give it back.
It's nothing to worry about.

48:31.209 --> 48:34.459
- We heard a noise.
- Noise?

48:34.542 --> 48:35.709
(Crash)

48:35.792 --> 48:39.126
Oh, oh, the really
loud crashing noise.

48:39.209 --> 48:40.542
Yeah.

48:40.626 --> 48:43.667
Pretty much that one, yeah.

48:43.751 --> 48:45.042
Gotcha!

48:48.084 --> 48:51.042
- (Jesse) Give it back! It's my skull!
- The noise in the kitchen?

48:51.126 --> 48:53.792
Yeah. Look, we just want to know
everything's OK.

48:53.876 --> 48:56.792
- Couldn't be better.
- Oh, really?

48:56.876 --> 48:59.626
(Strains) Nice... Nice bird.

49:09.834 --> 49:12.709
Listen, I wanted to tell you
before the evening got away,

49:12.792 --> 49:16.876
you are a funny, funny guy
and I mean that.

49:16.959 --> 49:19.334
That is the hardest commodity
to find in our business, really.

49:19.417 --> 49:23.126
Look at this shirt. Is this him?
They're bananas, bananas.

49:24.334 --> 49:25.751
Stay.

49:25.834 --> 49:27.542
(Muffled squawks)

49:27.626 --> 49:29.917
- Where is the beer?
- What are you doing out here?

49:30.001 --> 49:31.459
Somebody's coming!

49:31.542 --> 49:33.959
Do they go all the way around the back?
They do!

49:36.209 --> 49:38.501
- Uh-huh.
- Hi, John.

49:39.042 --> 49:42.667
- Buddy, what's cooking in the kitchen?
- Nothing.

49:42.751 --> 49:45.542
No? And what might be
in that closet there?

49:45.626 --> 49:49.792
- Nothing.
- Nothing? Well, can I see?

49:49.876 --> 49:53.876
John, I just told you
there's nothing in the closet.

49:53.959 --> 49:56.834
Well, let me see nothing in the closet.

49:56.917 --> 50:01.709
It, uh, wouldn't happen to be your
old friend Rochelle in there, would it?

50:01.792 --> 50:04.876
John, what is it you're accusing me of
in my own house?

50:04.959 --> 50:07.792
I'm not accusing you of anything.

50:07.876 --> 50:13.501
I'm just asking a question, but I do think
Kate would like an explanation.

50:13.584 --> 50:15.084
You want an explanation?

50:15.709 --> 50:18.292
All right, I'll give you an explanation.

50:18.376 --> 50:20.626
Kate, Kate, get in here!
Kate, I need to talk to you.

50:20.709 --> 50:22.542
- Why are you yelling?
- I'm not yelling.

50:22.626 --> 50:25.209
Now Kate, you know
that since we got here

50:25.292 --> 50:28.292
there's been some strange things
going on in this house.

50:28.376 --> 50:32.001
Charlie! They want an explanation
and I'm going to give them one.

50:32.084 --> 50:33.334
Now, listen.

50:33.417 --> 50:36.751
All right now, Charlie and I, last night,
went to the cemetery

50:36.834 --> 50:39.542
and we dug up
my great-great-grandfather's grave.

50:39.626 --> 50:43.459
We were looking for a crystal skull.
It's supposed to be magic.

50:43.542 --> 50:45.792
Anyway, we dug it up
and we got the skull,

50:45.876 --> 50:47.959
but we also found
my great-great-grandfather.

50:48.042 --> 50:50.209
He was dead, but he's alive.

50:50.292 --> 50:52.126
I mean he's a mummy
and we brought him back

50:52.209 --> 50:54.834
and he's been staying
in the basement.

50:55.917 --> 50:58.084
And Charlie and I have just been
running through this jungle

50:58.167 --> 51:00.001
trying to get the skull back.

51:00.084 --> 51:03.584
And that's who's in there, for
your information, Mr. Sherlock Holmes.

51:11.501 --> 51:12.876
Hi, Rochelle.

51:12.959 --> 51:15.459
What are you doing in here?

51:15.542 --> 51:16.501
There's been a mistake.

51:16.584 --> 51:18.709
- Apparently.
- You don't understand.

51:18.792 --> 51:21.084
- I understand perfectly.
- No, Kate, listen to me.

51:21.167 --> 51:22.959
I have no idea
what she was doing in there.

51:23.042 --> 51:25.417
- Well, who did you think was in there?
- A mummy!

51:25.501 --> 51:28.459
Or maybe even a baby pterodactyl.

51:38.251 --> 51:40.667
Shame on you, Jesse.

51:44.709 --> 51:47.126
Look! It's a prehistoric bird.

51:47.209 --> 51:49.042
(Squawking)

51:50.626 --> 51:52.042
Kate!

51:54.834 --> 51:57.792
(Car horn honking)

52:07.042 --> 52:09.084
Here, let me get those from you.

52:09.167 --> 52:12.126
(Charlie) Good riddance.
She's out of here.

52:12.209 --> 52:14.251
Now we can do whatever we want.

52:14.334 --> 52:18.126
Run around in our underwear,
phony phone calls, all kinds of crazy...

52:18.209 --> 52:22.459
Shut up, Charlie.
Can't you shut your mouth just once?

52:29.792 --> 52:33.584
- Surprise!
- Gramps, where's Rochelle?

52:33.667 --> 52:34.751
Watch this.

52:39.376 --> 52:41.001
Jesse.

52:42.042 --> 52:45.126
I waited so long for you.

52:45.209 --> 52:50.334
Rochelle, it's great to see you, but
I'm having some family problems right now.

52:50.417 --> 52:52.084
You understand?

52:52.167 --> 52:56.959
Hey Charlie, can you call Rochelle a cab?

52:57.042 --> 52:59.959
- Hey, Chucky.
- Hey, don't call me Chucky, OK?

53:02.167 --> 53:04.042
It's very sweet of you to come.

53:08.042 --> 53:09.501
Thanks.

53:19.834 --> 53:22.376
(Chirruping)

53:22.459 --> 53:24.876
Hey there, birdie.

53:25.626 --> 53:28.751
How about a little trade, huh? OK?

53:28.834 --> 53:31.292
Come on. Come to Daddy.

53:39.376 --> 53:41.084
(Gulps)

53:41.167 --> 53:44.834
(Squealing)

53:44.917 --> 53:49.376
- I think he wants some more.
- I don't have any more steak.

53:50.709 --> 53:52.417
(Laughing)

53:52.501 --> 53:53.709
(Barking)

53:53.792 --> 53:56.542
Now, I know that smells good.

53:56.626 --> 53:59.584
Daddy's going to have it ready
right away. Right away.

53:59.667 --> 54:03.417
That's a puppy, yup, yup, yup.

54:03.501 --> 54:06.584
I know. I know. Daddy knows.

54:06.667 --> 54:08.584
Now, open your mouth.

54:10.876 --> 54:12.126
(Chuckles)

54:13.459 --> 54:15.334
Yep, yep, yep.

54:18.917 --> 54:20.459
Gramps.

54:20.542 --> 54:22.292
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

54:22.376 --> 54:24.376
You got me a little upset.

54:26.751 --> 54:32.459
I was just hankering
to play a joke on somebody and...

54:36.209 --> 54:40.251
I'm sorry that it turned out
to be you.

54:40.334 --> 54:43.167
That's enough, Bippy.

54:43.251 --> 54:45.584
Bippy, that's enough.

54:45.667 --> 54:48.417
(Snarling)

54:48.501 --> 54:49.626
(Yelping)

54:49.709 --> 54:53.792
Now look, you go on out and play.

54:53.876 --> 54:56.626
That's it. There you go.

54:56.709 --> 54:59.209
Um, Gramps, look, I got to get to bed.

54:59.292 --> 55:02.417
Do you want me to put
the skull back on the fireplace?

55:02.501 --> 55:04.959
I'll take care of that.

55:29.084 --> 55:31.376
(Clanking)

55:41.042 --> 55:43.292
(Clank)

56:11.167 --> 56:12.917
(Barking)

56:13.001 --> 56:14.126
Ah.

56:14.209 --> 56:16.251
(Barking)

56:16.334 --> 56:18.209
(Laughs)

56:19.126 --> 56:20.751
Bippy.

56:20.834 --> 56:22.792
You little rascal.

56:22.876 --> 56:23.876
(Laughs)

56:23.959 --> 56:26.417
You scared the bejesus out of me.

56:36.167 --> 56:37.667
(Barking)

56:37.751 --> 56:40.417
(They speak in own language)

56:44.251 --> 56:46.376
(Bippy whining)

57:02.501 --> 57:03.667
(Barks)

57:11.834 --> 57:13.542
(Barking)

57:15.501 --> 57:16.876
Gramps.

57:16.959 --> 57:17.792
Gramps.

57:17.876 --> 57:19.626
(Barking)

57:19.709 --> 57:22.126
Jesse, Jesse boy.

57:22.209 --> 57:25.542
- Are you all right?
- They bushwhacked me.

57:25.626 --> 57:29.626
It must've been 30, 40 of them.

57:29.709 --> 57:32.084
They come at me from all directions.

57:34.167 --> 57:36.667
Charlie, get up. Charlie, come on.

57:36.751 --> 57:38.251
Charlie.

57:38.334 --> 57:40.167
Charlie, wake up.

57:40.251 --> 57:41.251
Get up!

57:41.334 --> 57:43.501
Charlie, come on.

57:43.584 --> 57:44.584
Come on.

57:44.667 --> 57:48.417
Oh Jesus, Charlie come on.

57:48.501 --> 57:49.459
Charlie.

57:49.542 --> 57:51.084
Charlie, get up.

57:54.251 --> 57:56.584
This better be real important.

57:56.667 --> 57:59.417
- Gramps lost the skull.
- What?

57:59.501 --> 58:01.667
Somebody, I don't know who, stole it.

58:01.751 --> 58:03.917
He's dying, Charlie.
We've got to get it back.

58:04.001 --> 58:08.251
After all we did for him, he loses it?
I can't believe he did that, Jess.

58:08.334 --> 58:10.876
I mean I never met
anyone so irresponsible.

58:10.959 --> 58:13.626
- You know I risked my life for that...
- Charlie!

58:13.709 --> 58:15.959
(Doorbell)

58:19.667 --> 58:20.917
- Yeah?
- Uh, uh, Bill.

58:21.001 --> 58:23.167
- Bill Tanner, electrician.
- Uh, Jesse McLaughlin.

58:23.251 --> 58:26.042
Nice to meet you, Jesse. A young lady
called. Said you needed some work done.

58:26.126 --> 58:29.084
- She did, huh?
- The fuse box down in the basement?

58:29.167 --> 58:33.209
Uh, listen Bill, I'm sorry to trouble you,
but this really isn't the right time.

58:33.292 --> 58:35.292
That's all right Jesse,
I'm not going to get in your way.

58:35.376 --> 58:37.376
You just show me what needs fixing.

58:37.459 --> 58:41.626
This is quite a room you got here.
Yeah, very, very nice.

58:41.709 --> 58:44.709
- That's a weird fireplace, though.
- Uh, Bill.

58:44.792 --> 58:47.042
- Bill.
- So, what we got in here?

58:47.126 --> 58:48.709
Ah, there it is.

58:50.542 --> 58:53.376
Three mount 240.
These old houses are loaded with them.

58:53.459 --> 58:55.959
So this the room
you having problems with, Jesse?

58:56.042 --> 59:00.459
Yeah, all along this wall,
but the rest of the house is fine.

59:01.542 --> 59:03.917
I wouldn't worry about that, Jesse.
It didn't look too valuable.

59:06.709 --> 59:10.876
Yep, yep, yep,
just as I expected.

59:10.959 --> 59:13.126
Jesse, you got a problem here,

59:13.209 --> 59:16.626
but hey, like with any problem you
don't want to let it get the best of you.

59:16.709 --> 59:20.501
You know, I've been working on
these houses for about 20 years now.

59:20.584 --> 59:24.001
I've seen enough tragedy and disaster to
make you want to upchuck in your shorts.

59:24.084 --> 59:27.834
You see, these old houses they uh,
they just got minds of their own.

59:27.917 --> 59:30.334
You know and ya just got
to teach him who's boss.

59:30.417 --> 59:32.501
You know, just sort of
give 'em a spanking.

59:33.584 --> 59:35.959
Huh. Must be foreign-made.

59:36.042 --> 59:39.376
Well, I'm going to fix this
old house up for you Jesse,

59:39.459 --> 59:41.792
just like it's brand spanking new.

59:44.709 --> 59:47.126
(Machine whirrs and bleeps)

59:56.334 --> 59:58.167
- What is that?
- Shh.

59:58.251 --> 01:00:01.042
(Machine whirring)

01:00:04.376 --> 01:00:05.584
(Bill) Uh-huh.

01:00:08.042 --> 01:00:09.376
Oh.

01:00:11.792 --> 01:00:13.292
Ooh.

01:00:15.292 --> 01:00:16.584
Ah.

01:00:18.584 --> 01:00:23.376
- What do you hear?
- Ah, Jesse, Jesse, it's not good.

01:00:23.459 --> 01:00:27.667
I've seen this before and it's always
made my adenoids curdle.

01:00:28.376 --> 01:00:32.626
Hey, don't monkey with those switches,
It's going to blow us both to Milwaukee.

01:00:32.709 --> 01:00:36.001
It's touch and go from here, pal.
Could go either way, Jesse.

01:00:36.084 --> 01:00:40.084
Oh, hey, hey, Jesse. Want to step
into my office here, for a second?

01:00:41.376 --> 01:00:43.209
Listen buddy,

01:00:43.292 --> 01:00:47.834
I like to be alone with my work,
so if you don't mind...?

01:00:47.917 --> 01:00:49.667
- Sure.
- You got something to do?

01:00:49.751 --> 01:00:51.126
- Sure.
- Go do it. buddy.

01:00:51.209 --> 01:00:53.292
Go do it.

01:00:53.376 --> 01:00:54.251
Go do it.

01:00:54.334 --> 01:00:56.126
(Chuckles) Nice kid.

01:01:02.126 --> 01:01:04.542
(♪ Fanfare)

01:01:31.334 --> 01:01:32.417
Oops.

01:01:47.542 --> 01:01:49.209
Weird!

01:01:55.917 --> 01:01:58.417
(Ghostly howling)

01:01:58.501 --> 01:02:00.251
See anything?

01:02:01.626 --> 01:02:03.959
Forget it.

01:02:04.042 --> 01:02:07.334
I'm not going up there.
Gramps can get his own damn skull.

01:02:07.417 --> 01:02:10.542
Come on, Charlie. Gramps said they went
in here, so don't wimp out on me now.

01:02:10.626 --> 01:02:12.501
Hey, buddy.

01:02:13.959 --> 01:02:17.959
- Oh, scared you, huh? Relax.
- Oh God, Bill, are you all right?

01:02:18.042 --> 01:02:20.917
- Yeah, fine, fine.
- Who is this?

01:02:21.001 --> 01:02:24.251
- Uh, Bill.
- Bill Tanner, electrician.

01:02:24.334 --> 01:02:28.209
Charlie Couriel, entrepreneur.

01:02:28.584 --> 01:02:32.751
Fellas, we got a little problem in the
other room. You better come have a look.

01:02:32.834 --> 01:02:35.626
Look Bill, I'm sorry,
but this really isn't a good time.

01:02:35.709 --> 01:02:37.626
Why don't you pack it up
and come back tomorrow.

01:02:37.709 --> 01:02:41.042
I think we better go in the other room
and have a look.

01:02:48.584 --> 01:02:50.876
Yep.

01:02:50.959 --> 01:02:52.834
There it is.

01:02:53.584 --> 01:02:56.667
Looks like you've got some kind of
alternate universe in there or something.

01:02:58.917 --> 01:03:00.001
Thanks.

01:03:00.084 --> 01:03:02.959
Come on, Charlie.

01:03:03.042 --> 01:03:07.251
Guess I'm next. Hey Jesse, are there
any spiders in there? You know...

01:03:07.334 --> 01:03:08.584
You coming, Charlie?

01:03:10.459 --> 01:03:15.376
(Bill) I don't know, it's an alternate
dimension in there or something and uh...

01:03:15.459 --> 01:03:17.459
(Jesse) Incredible.

01:03:18.209 --> 01:03:21.001
Well, hold on a second, will ya?

01:03:21.084 --> 01:03:23.126
Uh, I've been through
this kind of thing before.

01:03:23.209 --> 01:03:26.042
Don't touch anything until I get there.

01:03:27.209 --> 01:03:30.084
Looks like you're going to need
the help of a professional.

01:03:37.292 --> 01:03:39.709
- You got a flashlight?
- Yeah.

01:03:52.334 --> 01:03:55.417
(Jesse) You know something?
I'm incredibly scared right now.

01:03:55.501 --> 01:03:59.626
- (Charlie) Don't be a fag, OK?
- Shh! Listen.

01:03:59.709 --> 01:04:01.459
(Strange mutterings)

01:04:01.542 --> 01:04:03.876
I think it's coming from over there.

01:04:14.959 --> 01:04:17.292
(Sinister voices)

01:04:22.876 --> 01:04:24.751
(Chanting)

01:04:24.834 --> 01:04:26.792
(Woman moaning)

01:04:28.709 --> 01:04:31.084
- (Jesse) There it is.
- (Bill) Yep.

01:04:33.917 --> 01:04:35.876
Well, it's not going to be easy.

01:04:38.376 --> 01:04:40.501
(Chanting in own language)

01:04:42.626 --> 01:04:44.792
They're not going to sacrifice her,
are they?

01:04:44.876 --> 01:04:48.001
Hey Jesse, now, is she a virgin?
Because I've never seen one before.

01:04:48.084 --> 01:04:50.167
She's really dynamite!

01:04:50.251 --> 01:04:53.251
(Chanting)

01:04:53.334 --> 01:04:54.751
Hey!

01:04:56.709 --> 01:04:57.334
No!

01:04:57.417 --> 01:04:59.251
No!

01:04:59.334 --> 01:05:00.917
Oh, boy.

01:05:02.542 --> 01:05:04.667
Hey, come on.

01:05:04.751 --> 01:05:08.417
Well, I'm sorry we thought
she was somebody that we knew.

01:05:08.501 --> 01:05:10.709
Go ahead and enjoy. It's OK.

01:05:12.376 --> 01:05:15.042
(Shouts instructions)

01:05:15.126 --> 01:05:17.167
(Aggressive yelling)

01:05:19.126 --> 01:05:20.876
Watch this.

01:05:24.917 --> 01:05:26.376
Wa-hoo!

01:05:48.501 --> 01:05:50.501
Neat, huh?

01:05:50.584 --> 01:05:51.792
(Laughs)

01:06:05.334 --> 01:06:06.334
Thank you.

01:06:18.584 --> 01:06:20.001
Come on. Come on.

01:06:20.084 --> 01:06:22.042
Get her out of here.

01:06:32.084 --> 01:06:33.001
Jesse!

01:06:38.667 --> 01:06:41.917
Aagh!

01:06:46.292 --> 01:06:48.501
Come on. Get out of here.
I'll hold them off.

01:06:48.584 --> 01:06:52.876
- Bill, I don't remember which way.
- Follow the string.

01:06:52.959 --> 01:06:54.626
Come on.

01:06:54.709 --> 01:06:56.959
- Bill, come on.
- Don't worry about me.

01:06:57.042 --> 01:06:59.917
I got to get home.
It's my kid's little league night.

01:07:00.001 --> 01:07:01.917
(Yelling)

01:07:08.584 --> 01:07:10.626
Where's Bill? I don't see him.

01:07:16.251 --> 01:07:18.126
Hey Bill, all right.

01:07:18.209 --> 01:07:21.792
Ah, Charlie, good to see you back.
I started to get a little concerned here.

01:07:21.876 --> 01:07:27.126
- Hey, hey Bill, what are you doing here?
- You guys throw one heck of a party.

01:07:27.209 --> 01:07:31.084
I'd really like to thank you
for inviting me along uh, Jess.

01:07:31.709 --> 01:07:34.251
It's been a pleasure and Miss...

01:07:34.334 --> 01:07:36.709
(Speaking slowly) It was a pleasure
to meet you.

01:07:39.459 --> 01:07:41.959
Oh and Jess, listen,
if you need any more work done

01:07:42.042 --> 01:07:44.001
just give me a call there, huh?

01:07:44.084 --> 01:07:46.667
- Take care, Charlie.
- See ya.

01:07:49.501 --> 01:07:52.042
Who was that man?

01:07:52.126 --> 01:07:53.459
(Sniffs)

01:07:55.376 --> 01:07:56.959
(Contented chirruping)

01:08:02.251 --> 01:08:05.126
- Where the hell's the food?
- I'll go check.

01:08:05.209 --> 01:08:06.626
(Squealing)

01:08:06.709 --> 01:08:08.292
Tell him we're starving.

01:08:08.376 --> 01:08:10.084
(Barking)

01:08:10.167 --> 01:08:14.876
You know, I've been watching her
and she really likes you.

01:08:14.959 --> 01:08:17.209
Seriously, she likes you.

01:08:17.292 --> 01:08:20.376
- Come on, Charlie.
- No, I'm serious.

01:08:20.459 --> 01:08:21.542
Watch.

01:08:21.626 --> 01:08:23.876
Who do you like better?

01:08:23.959 --> 01:08:27.001
Me or him?

01:08:27.084 --> 01:08:30.876
Me, Charlie fun,
you know, crazy guy, right.

01:08:30.959 --> 01:08:32.126
Or him?

01:08:38.917 --> 01:08:40.709
I rest my case, Jesse.

01:08:40.792 --> 01:08:41.834
Ow!

01:08:44.084 --> 01:08:47.959
All right. Well, if everybody's hungry,
dig in while it's hot.

01:08:48.042 --> 01:08:53.001
Jess, shouldn't we say grace, you know,
say a few nice words about God or whoever?

01:08:53.084 --> 01:08:54.417
Oh.

01:08:59.459 --> 01:09:05.334
All right. Uh, I guess I'd just like
to thank everyone

01:09:05.417 --> 01:09:09.876
for their special contribution
to the meal.

01:09:11.251 --> 01:09:18.209
And to say that I guess I think
of all of you as, well, my family now.

01:09:19.292 --> 01:09:20.459
(Barking)

01:09:20.542 --> 01:09:24.042
That was well put, son.
Now, let's eat.

01:09:24.126 --> 01:09:25.459
(Squawking)

01:09:31.792 --> 01:09:33.667
(Squawks)

01:09:56.709 --> 01:09:58.501
Slim.

01:09:58.584 --> 01:10:01.542
You low-down weasel.

01:10:01.626 --> 01:10:03.751
I've been waiting for you.

01:10:03.834 --> 01:10:06.292
(Demonic voice) Long time, partner.

01:10:12.709 --> 01:10:14.251
(Gramps) Charlie!

01:10:14.334 --> 01:10:16.001
He's mine.

01:10:19.376 --> 01:10:23.042
I knew you'd catch up
with me sooner or later.

01:10:25.626 --> 01:10:26.584
(Gunshot)

01:10:26.667 --> 01:10:28.042
Gramps!

01:10:41.501 --> 01:10:43.209
Gramps.

01:10:47.751 --> 01:10:48.751
Charlie!

01:10:53.751 --> 01:10:55.292
(Woman cries out)

01:11:05.167 --> 01:11:07.501
(Groaning)

01:11:07.584 --> 01:11:11.084
After all this time.

01:11:11.167 --> 01:11:12.959
He got me.

01:11:15.792 --> 01:11:17.626
You're going to need this.

01:11:22.792 --> 01:11:26.209
He's the one that
killed your ma and pa.

01:13:28.334 --> 01:13:30.292
Oh, my God.

01:13:33.126 --> 01:13:34.167
Charlie!

01:13:34.251 --> 01:13:36.584
(Shouts muffled warning)

01:14:23.709 --> 01:14:24.917
(Gunshot)

01:14:25.001 --> 01:14:26.376
(Gunshot)

01:14:33.626 --> 01:14:35.167
(Gunshot)

01:14:52.626 --> 01:14:53.917
(Gunshot)

01:15:38.167 --> 01:15:39.667
(Spurs clink)

01:15:41.251 --> 01:15:42.376
(Gunshot)

01:16:07.459 --> 01:16:09.751
(Demonic voice) Jesse.

01:16:09.834 --> 01:16:12.626
(Gunshot)

01:16:16.209 --> 01:16:18.751
(Sirens approaching)

01:16:30.042 --> 01:16:32.584
You and you, come with me around back.

01:16:34.084 --> 01:16:37.334
(On radio): 'Hostage sniper hold-up
in the 175 Wood Acre Drive...'

01:16:37.417 --> 01:16:40.167
- What's up, Vinnie?
- Sheriff, we got a crazy in there

01:16:40.251 --> 01:16:43.126
- shooting up the whole neighborhood.
- The old McLaughlin place.

01:16:43.209 --> 01:16:45.459
That's right. We just found
who owns the place. Jesse McLaughlin.

01:16:45.542 --> 01:16:49.042
It's old Clarence's son.
Just moved in a couple of days ago.

01:16:49.126 --> 01:16:51.292
- Clarence's son?
- Yeah.

01:16:51.376 --> 01:16:54.542
He's moving out tonight.
Let me talk to that son.

01:16:56.917 --> 01:16:59.501
- What's his name?
- Jesse.

01:16:59.584 --> 01:17:03.126
(Loudspeaker) Jesse.
We got the place surrounded.

01:17:03.792 --> 01:17:06.959
Why don't you come out peacefully
and give yourself up?

01:17:07.042 --> 01:17:09.917
We don't want anybody to get hurt.

01:18:00.167 --> 01:18:02.917
(Slim) Now, it's mine.

01:18:24.751 --> 01:18:26.167
(Gunshot)

01:18:28.251 --> 01:18:30.126
Get down. Hold your fire.

01:18:30.209 --> 01:18:32.917
What the hell's going on in there?

01:18:34.251 --> 01:18:36.959
(Groans) Jesse!

01:18:42.792 --> 01:18:44.834
(Gurgling)

01:19:02.334 --> 01:19:03.876
(Sheriff) Hold your fire!

01:19:26.667 --> 01:19:29.334
Did you blow his head off?

01:19:32.334 --> 01:19:34.751
(Chuckling) That's a good boy.

01:19:37.167 --> 01:19:41.126
I thought for sure he'd kick your ass.

01:19:41.209 --> 01:19:42.584
(Laughs)

01:19:45.459 --> 01:19:49.251
- But I didn't let on though, did I, son?
- No.

01:19:49.334 --> 01:19:51.126
No, you didn't, Gramps.

01:19:51.209 --> 01:19:53.167
(Groans)

01:19:57.709 --> 01:19:59.667
This is it, kid.

01:20:01.542 --> 01:20:03.959
You're not going to die.

01:20:04.042 --> 01:20:06.001
The skull is right here.

01:20:08.292 --> 01:20:12.751
It don't make no difference no more, son.

01:20:14.084 --> 01:20:18.126
I've done all I can do in this world.

01:20:19.376 --> 01:20:22.917
And it's time to move on.

01:20:23.001 --> 01:20:24.709
No. No, don't.

01:20:28.501 --> 01:20:32.084
Now, you get what you want
from this old skull.

01:20:34.042 --> 01:20:37.959
I got something real special.

01:20:38.042 --> 01:20:43.084
I got to meet
my great-great-grandson

01:20:43.167 --> 01:20:46.292
and I had a hell of a time.

01:20:48.751 --> 01:20:57.876
You figure what you want
and then get rid of the goddamn thing.

01:20:59.126 --> 01:21:00.334
No.

01:21:02.126 --> 01:21:03.626
Come on.

01:21:05.042 --> 01:21:07.251
Come on, Gramps.

01:21:08.084 --> 01:21:09.751
Hold on.

01:21:12.584 --> 01:21:14.584
Hold on, Gramps.

01:21:15.917 --> 01:21:17.917
I love you, Gramps.

01:21:20.834 --> 01:21:24.084
I love you too, Jesse.

01:21:42.126 --> 01:21:45.167
(Sheriff) Jesse, this is your last chance.

01:21:45.251 --> 01:21:47.626
Come out with your hands up.

01:21:47.709 --> 01:21:51.376
I'm going to count to ten
and then we're coming in firing.

01:21:53.709 --> 01:21:59.626
One, two, three,

01:21:59.709 --> 01:22:06.626
four, five, six,

01:22:06.709 --> 01:22:10.959
seven, eight, nine...

01:22:11.042 --> 01:22:12.501
Agh!

01:22:12.584 --> 01:22:14.792
- Take cover!
- Gun fired!

01:22:16.042 --> 01:22:17.084
(Gunshot)

01:22:25.501 --> 01:22:27.126
(Gunshots)
