<i>Air and naval
forces of the United States</i>

00:08.947 --> 00:11.649
<i>launched a series of strikes</i>

00:11.683 --> 00:13.843
<i>Pan Am Flight 103 crashed
into the town of Lockerbie.</i>

00:13.844 --> 00:15.124
<i>He has sanctioned acts of terror</i>

00:15.153 --> 00:17.755
<i>in Africa, Europe and the Middle East.</i>

00:17.823 --> 00:20.391
<i>This will not stand, this
aggression against, uh, Kuwait.</i>

00:20.459 --> 00:22.159
<i>This relentless pursuit of terror.</i>

00:22.194 --> 00:23.761
<i>We will make no distinction...</i>

00:23.795 --> 00:25.056
<i>The USS</i> Cole <i>was attacked</i>

00:25.057 --> 00:26.497
<i>while refueling in the port of Aden.</i>

00:26.531 --> 00:28.399
This was an act of terrorism.

00:28.467 --> 00:30.935
It was a despicable and cowardly act.

00:30.969 --> 00:33.117
<i>The next samba</i>
<i>we're going to swing for you</i>

00:33.118 --> 00:34.438
is one of the good old favorites.

00:34.473 --> 00:37.074
...until something stops him.

00:37.142 --> 00:39.910
<i>I'm just making sure</i>
<i>we don't get hit again.</i>

00:41.978 --> 00:44.521
<i>That plane crashed</i>
<i>into the World Trade Center.</i>

00:44.883 --> 00:47.118
<i>Thousands of people running.</i>

00:47.152 --> 00:50.855

vigilant at home and abroad.

00:57.496 --> 00:59.930
<i>What the fuck are you doing?</i>

00:59.998 --> 01:01.932
Fuck!

01:01.967 --> 01:03.934
<i>I missed something once before.</i>

01:03.969 --> 01:06.671
<i>I won't...</i>
<i>I</i> can't <i>let that happen again.</i>

01:07.973 --> 01:09.874
<i>It was ten years ago.</i>

01:09.941 --> 01:11.341

<i>Previously on</i> Homeland...

01:26.291 --> 01:27.811
How come I've never heard of this guy?

01:27.812 --> 01:29.059
Who, Quinn?

01:29.094 --> 01:30.294
Just check around.

01:30.362 --> 01:31.829
So he met some guy on a city bus?

01:31.897 --> 01:35.466
- You know him?
- Dar Adal.

01:35.534 --> 01:36.934
That's Dar Adal?

01:36.968 --> 01:39.270
That's him, in the flesh.

01:39.337 --> 01:41.939
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

01:42.007 --> 01:44.141
Carrie, I need you to go get
my family right away.

01:44.175 --> 01:45.910
Take them somewhere safe.

01:45.977 --> 01:48.212
The CIA sent me, Jess.
There's a threat.

01:49.281 --> 01:51.348
Whoa! This is sick!

01:51.383 --> 01:52.483
Thank you...

01:52.551 --> 01:54.585
for being here.

02:00.859 --> 02:02.299
Carrie, he's here;
he's in America.

02:02.300 --> 02:03.961
Abu Nazir?

02:04.029 --> 02:06.664
How is that even possible?
Jesus Christ!

02:06.731 --> 02:09.199
<i>If that's the device,
it's at least 200 pounds.</i>

02:09.234 --> 02:11.502
Tac One, Tac Two, Tac Three,
move now. Over.

02:13.371 --> 02:15.372
<i>FBI!</i>

02:15.407 --> 02:16.307
Show me your hands!

02:17.409 --> 02:18.442
It's not him.

02:18.476 --> 02:19.710
It's not Abu Nazir.

02:22.247 --> 02:24.949
Stand down.
We still need him. I say again,

02:24.983 --> 02:26.317
stand down.

02:26.384 --> 02:27.704
What the hell are <i>you</i> doing here?

02:27.719 --> 02:28.819
We got 'em, Brody.

02:28.887 --> 02:30.387
Your information was good.

02:30.422 --> 02:31.889
Got 'em all?

02:31.923 --> 02:34.325
All but Nazir...
he's still out there.

03:00.619 --> 03:04.088
Walter's Waffles for
lunch every Tuesday.

03:04.122 --> 03:06.357
Some habits die hard, I guess.

03:06.424 --> 03:07.758
Little things I can count on

03:07.792 --> 03:09.893
mean more and more
to me as I get older.

03:09.961 --> 03:11.061
Do you find that?

03:11.129 --> 03:13.430
I find that everything

03:13.465 --> 03:17.434
means more to me as I get older.

03:17.469 --> 03:20.537
Plus, I've got a crush on Berta.

03:23.975 --> 03:26.076
I went by your house.

03:26.144 --> 03:27.978
Oh...
New owners.

03:28.013 --> 03:29.580
Nice people.

03:29.648 --> 03:31.582
There's no point
in keeping a house anymore...

03:31.650 --> 03:34.084
I have to move every few weeks.

03:34.152 --> 03:36.253
Christ, I miss the Cold War.

03:36.321 --> 03:38.422
Prefer the daily threat
of nuclear annihilation?

03:38.490 --> 03:40.290
No, I miss the rules.

03:40.325 --> 03:42.693
The Soviets didn't shoot us;
we didn't shoot them.

03:42.727 --> 03:44.895
Boy, this bunch...

03:44.963 --> 03:47.564
- Thought you retired.
- Oh...

03:47.632 --> 03:49.900
Oh, I tried, I tried.

03:51.002 --> 03:54.371
Tell me about Peter Quinn.

03:54.406 --> 03:55.906
Peter Quinn?

03:55.974 --> 03:58.375
You met with him last
night around 8:00.

03:58.410 --> 04:00.010
Number seven bus.

04:04.249 --> 04:05.649
Who's asking?

04:05.684 --> 04:07.084
Me.

04:07.152 --> 04:09.720
Just you?

04:11.523 --> 04:13.824
Peter Quinn is one of mine.

04:18.529 --> 04:21.798
Why would Estes put
a off-the-book black ops guy

04:21.866 --> 04:24.268
in charge of a straight-up
intelligence operation?

04:24.335 --> 04:27.004
He didn't tell me;
he just asked for a soldier.

04:27.038 --> 04:28.338
Soldiers kill people.

04:28.373 --> 04:31.241
They also fix airplane engines

04:31.276 --> 04:34.778
and cook bad food...
it was a figure of speech.

04:34.846 --> 04:38.615
Maybe Estes put Quinn in there
just to keep his eye on you.

04:41.786 --> 04:44.855
Maybe he doesn't trust you.

04:44.889 --> 04:46.623
Why wouldn't he trust me?

04:48.359 --> 04:51.428
You still afraid
to get your hands dirty, Saul?

04:51.463 --> 04:53.764
I still prefer to
figure the problem out,

04:53.798 --> 04:55.499
not obliterate it.

04:55.567 --> 04:57.868
You're too sensitive
for this line of work,

04:57.902 --> 04:59.103
you always have been.

05:00.739 --> 05:02.940
I'm amazed you've lasted this long.

05:04.809 --> 05:06.477
Me, too.

05:19.724 --> 05:22.392
- Has Brody called?
- Not yet.

05:22.427 --> 05:24.828
- He will.
- I know.

05:24.896 --> 05:26.997
Listen, Jessica, about last night...

05:27.065 --> 05:28.298
Hey, shh.

05:28.333 --> 05:30.300
I loved last night.

05:30.335 --> 05:33.771
It was fun.

05:35.106 --> 05:36.740
It was, wasn't it?

05:36.775 --> 05:38.008
Yeah, it was.

05:38.076 --> 05:40.978
I keep waiting to feel guilty.

05:50.455 --> 05:52.189
Brody.

05:52.257 --> 05:54.658
I'll be next door.

05:58.696 --> 06:00.430
Welcome home.

06:04.803 --> 06:07.137
Pretty posh.

06:09.440 --> 06:11.208
Thanks for helping out, Mike.

06:11.276 --> 06:12.843
No problem.

06:12.877 --> 06:15.212
Let me go pack my bags.

06:20.552 --> 06:22.853
- Everything good?
- Everything's great.

06:23.988 --> 06:26.023
Hey, Dad.

06:26.057 --> 06:27.491
Hey, buddy.

06:28.827 --> 06:31.228
Come here.

06:37.202 --> 06:39.002
Hi, Dad.

06:40.738 --> 06:43.106
I'll be heading out.

06:43.174 --> 06:45.309
You guys need anything else,
give me a holler.

06:45.343 --> 06:46.710
Bye.

06:49.848 --> 06:51.815
See you around.

06:57.088 --> 06:58.055
Dad?

06:58.089 --> 07:00.123
Are you a spy now?

07:00.191 --> 07:03.594
No. No, I'm just a congressman
who helped the CIA.

07:03.661 --> 07:05.295
So you won't be disappearing again?

07:05.363 --> 07:08.365
No. I'm not going anywhere.

07:14.172 --> 07:16.406
I've got homework.

07:16.474 --> 07:19.209
You, too.
You got a book report to write.

07:28.019 --> 07:29.953
So, what happens next?

07:30.021 --> 07:33.257
- Do we get to go home?
- Not quite yet.

07:33.324 --> 07:35.004
Well, the kids
can't miss any more school

07:35.026 --> 07:36.193
without falling behind.

07:38.696 --> 07:41.098
They're going stir-crazy.

07:41.165 --> 07:43.300
- I noticed.
- So am I.

07:43.368 --> 07:45.202
I noticed.

07:51.542 --> 07:53.710
It's good that Mike was here.

07:54.846 --> 07:57.748
Yeah. It helped.

08:06.491 --> 08:08.959
What are we doing?

08:10.128 --> 08:13.196
I don't know.

08:23.741 --> 08:25.709
Dana told me it was Carrie

08:25.743 --> 08:28.946
that stopped you from
letting her go to the police.

08:28.980 --> 08:31.081
Yes, it was.

08:32.750 --> 08:35.318
Go ahead, answer it.

08:39.323 --> 08:40.657
Hello?

08:40.758 --> 08:42.292
Hey.

08:42.327 --> 08:44.695
Hey.

08:44.762 --> 08:47.402
So, the attorney general's ready
to honor our agreement with you,

08:47.403 --> 08:49.166
but as we discussed,
there are few things

08:49.233 --> 08:51.535
you'll need to do first.
Resign from Congress?

08:51.602 --> 08:54.004
For starters.
You'll also have to tell Walden

08:54.072 --> 08:55.839
that you're passing on the VP spot.

08:55.907 --> 08:59.076
The press are gonna have
a lot of questions when you do,

08:59.110 --> 09:01.845
so we're gonna have to figure
out what you're gonna say.

09:01.913 --> 09:05.015
I could say it's personal.

09:05.083 --> 09:07.651
Just decided to put family
before politics.

09:09.520 --> 09:11.088
How <i>is</i> the family?

09:12.190 --> 09:14.324
I honestly don't know.

09:16.227 --> 09:18.195
Well, you can all go home soon.

09:18.262 --> 09:20.330
That should help.

09:24.068 --> 09:26.136
You okay?

09:27.271 --> 09:29.639
Yeah. Yeah.

09:29.741 --> 09:31.375
You?

09:31.409 --> 09:34.811
It's good to hear your voice.

09:34.879 --> 09:36.847
Yours, too.

09:36.914 --> 09:39.049
Talk to you later.

09:48.726 --> 09:51.395
Market stocks fell
for a fifth day, led by resources...

10:09.514 --> 10:11.181
The President of the United States...

10:11.249 --> 10:13.750
personally called
the director this morning

10:13.785 --> 10:16.620
and congratulated him
on a job well done.

10:23.795 --> 10:25.796
That's the good news.

10:27.298 --> 10:28.732
The bad news is,

10:28.800 --> 10:31.201
we still don't have Abu Nazir yet.

10:31.269 --> 10:34.538
With FBI help, we've dropped
a net over the DC metro area.

10:34.605 --> 10:36.039
Maryland, the Virginia State Police

10:36.107 --> 10:38.208
and the National Guard
have joined the search.

10:38.276 --> 10:40.610
Find Adal?

10:42.046 --> 10:44.781
What did he say?

10:44.816 --> 10:47.684
Quinn is one of his.

10:47.718 --> 10:50.020
So what's he doing here?

10:50.054 --> 10:53.090
That's a good question.

10:53.157 --> 10:55.792
There'll be plenty of time for
celebrating after we get Nazir.

10:55.827 --> 10:58.261
I am personally looking forward

10:58.329 --> 10:59.863
to at least several martinis.

11:07.472 --> 11:09.539
I had a talk with Dar Adal.

11:09.574 --> 11:12.109
He confirmed that Peter Quinn,
or whatever his real name is,

11:12.176 --> 11:13.710
comes from his side of things.

11:13.744 --> 11:15.278
So again I ask...

11:15.346 --> 11:17.314
What's he doing on my operation?

11:17.348 --> 11:19.649
<i>His</i> operation, Saul.

11:19.684 --> 11:21.585
It's his operation.

11:21.652 --> 11:22.819
And now it's over.

11:22.854 --> 11:23.920
Is it?

11:24.021 --> 11:25.956
Yes.

11:26.023 --> 11:28.158
Why is he still here?

11:30.027 --> 11:33.096
Brody knows that you and
Walden ordered a drone strike

11:33.197 --> 11:35.465
against a madrassa full of kids.
So?

11:35.533 --> 11:38.068
So it could be that Quinn's
an insurance policy

11:38.102 --> 11:40.137
against that information
ever becoming public.

11:40.204 --> 11:43.673
An <i>insurance</i> policy?

11:43.708 --> 11:45.976
Just what exactly are you implying?

11:46.043 --> 11:48.778
Only that you and Walden went
to great lengths once before

11:48.846 --> 11:50.280
to cover up the drone strike.

11:50.348 --> 11:52.149
Is this an accusation?

11:52.216 --> 11:54.736
- I'm only asking a question, David.
- Well, goddamn it, Saul,

11:54.737 --> 11:56.286
I'm not gonna dignify it with answer.

11:56.354 --> 11:58.855
- Is that a yes?
- Fuck you, Saul. Fuck you!

11:58.890 --> 12:00.357
Am I interrupting?

12:00.391 --> 12:01.825
No. What's up?

12:01.893 --> 12:04.053
Carrie's been in an accident.
DC police found her car

12:04.054 --> 12:06.094
on 17th Street all smashed up.
It was broad-sided.

12:06.095 --> 12:07.631
- Is she hurt?
- They can't find her.

12:07.698 --> 12:10.098
- What do you mean, they can't find her?
- She's not there.

12:10.101 --> 12:12.701
- They're looking in local hospitals.
- Get over to 17th Street.

12:18.376 --> 12:19.809
He knows.

12:29.086 --> 12:31.388
Oh, you dog.

12:31.422 --> 12:33.924
Sorry.

12:36.460 --> 12:38.895
Are you hustling me?

12:49.607 --> 12:52.475
Our friends at Secret Service
reached out to us.

12:52.510 --> 12:54.477
Finn Walden wants
to come and visit Dana.

12:54.512 --> 12:56.413
He says it's important.

12:56.447 --> 12:58.949
Finn Walden wants to pay Dana a visit.

12:58.983 --> 13:01.117
I don't think she'd like that.

13:01.152 --> 13:02.452
Shouldn't we ask her?

13:02.486 --> 13:04.788
Ask me what?

13:04.822 --> 13:06.756
Finn wants to come see you.

13:06.791 --> 13:09.226
Why?

13:09.293 --> 13:11.728
I don't know.
He says it's important.

13:11.796 --> 13:13.897
He's been texting me all day.

13:13.965 --> 13:15.832
He sounds like a mess.

13:17.134 --> 13:20.337
Okay.

13:20.371 --> 13:22.672
- I'll let them know.
- Thanks.

13:35.052 --> 13:37.487
Are you alone?

13:38.889 --> 13:40.290
No.

13:40.324 --> 13:42.158
I will call you back in one minute.

13:43.995 --> 13:46.229
Sorry. It's work.

13:50.668 --> 13:53.003
Hey. I'm just
stretching my legs.

13:53.037 --> 13:55.171
Mm-hmm.

14:15.860 --> 14:18.962
What the fuck have you done to Carrie?

14:19.030 --> 14:21.211
Did you think it would be easy?

14:21.708 --> 14:24.000
That you could betray me
and just walk away?

14:24.035 --> 14:25.235
It's over.

14:25.269 --> 14:28.305
Get that into your fucking your head!

14:28.372 --> 14:30.006
It's not over.

14:30.041 --> 14:31.675
Let me talk to her, goddamn it!

14:31.709 --> 14:33.910
Nicholas, calm down.

14:33.944 --> 14:36.680
If you want to help her, you
will do exactly as I tell you.

14:36.714 --> 14:41.384
I need you to get into the
vice president's home office.

14:41.419 --> 14:43.253
Why?

14:43.287 --> 14:44.587
There's a treadmill in there.

14:44.622 --> 14:46.523
Somewhere near it, there is

14:46.557 --> 14:48.892
a plastic case the size of a book.

14:48.926 --> 14:51.428
Inside that, there is a serial number.

14:51.462 --> 14:53.663
How the fuck do you know all this?

14:53.731 --> 14:55.665
<i>New York Times,</i> believe it or not.

14:57.134 --> 14:58.535
Get me the number.

14:58.569 --> 15:00.103
Why?

15:00.137 --> 15:01.971
Tell me, goddamn it!

15:06.410 --> 15:08.445
Walden has a bad heart.

15:08.479 --> 15:09.412
So?

15:09.447 --> 15:11.381
His pacemaker can be

15:11.415 --> 15:13.216
wirelessly accessed with that number.

15:13.250 --> 15:15.618
You're shitting me.

15:15.653 --> 15:17.187
I'm not.

15:17.254 --> 15:19.422
I won't do it.

15:19.457 --> 15:21.791
Yes, you will.

15:21.826 --> 15:24.728
No. I won't.

15:26.931 --> 15:29.366
Nazir?

15:29.433 --> 15:32.469
Nazir?

15:34.171 --> 15:37.107
Send me the number, or I will kill her.

15:37.141 --> 15:39.075
Oh, you'll kill her anyway.

15:39.110 --> 15:40.944
Right here.

15:40.978 --> 15:42.545
Right now.

15:42.613 --> 15:44.948
Okay.

15:44.982 --> 15:46.916
Okay, okay.

15:46.951 --> 15:49.486
Okay, just...

15:49.520 --> 15:51.888
Nazir?

15:51.956 --> 15:53.723
Nazir?!

16:28.159 --> 16:30.560
Hey, Dad?

16:30.628 --> 16:32.295
We gonna finish our game of Hearts?

16:32.329 --> 16:33.963
Not now.

16:44.809 --> 16:47.076
Carrington.

16:47.144 --> 16:49.145
Jim? It's Nick Brody.

16:49.180 --> 16:50.847
Is the vice president there?

16:50.881 --> 16:53.917
Oh, he's in a meeting
with the Israeli ambassador.

16:53.984 --> 16:55.452
Great. I need to talk to him.

16:55.486 --> 16:56.920
Something of an emergency.

16:56.954 --> 16:59.122
Well, I can't interrupt the meeting.

16:59.156 --> 17:00.990
All right. I understand.

17:01.025 --> 17:02.792
Uh, I'll be over.

17:02.827 --> 17:04.394
Will you keep him there?

17:04.462 --> 17:06.796
I'll do my best, Congressman.

17:13.804 --> 17:15.637
I got a small cyclone stirring

17:15.673 --> 17:17.941
over the matter of wheat subsidies.

17:18.008 --> 17:19.642
I got to go talk to the vice president.

17:19.676 --> 17:22.178
Of course.

17:22.213 --> 17:27.016
I'll need a car to take us
to the naval observatory in

17:27.050 --> 17:29.285
ten minutes?
Thanks.

19:34.945 --> 19:37.280
Oh.

19:41.452 --> 19:43.653
Oh, where the fuck are you, Carrie?

19:49.026 --> 19:50.627
There's no record of her

19:50.661 --> 19:52.795
at any of the local
hospitals or emergency rooms.

19:52.830 --> 19:54.590
Cops are still canvassing
the neighborhood.

19:54.591 --> 19:55.632
We might get lucky.

19:55.666 --> 20:00.436
Lucky? No one saw the crash?

20:00.471 --> 20:02.772
Well, one guy says he saw
a woman running away.

20:02.840 --> 20:04.474
Another says

20:04.541 --> 20:07.477
he saw a guy dragging a
woman into another car.

20:07.511 --> 20:09.779
Any surveillance tape?

20:09.813 --> 20:11.881
There's cameras
all over the place down here.

20:11.949 --> 20:14.050
Well, the cops are collecting
what they can find.

20:14.118 --> 20:16.352
Our computers will run a search.

20:18.956 --> 20:20.990
We dropped the ball.

20:23.494 --> 20:26.996
Never should have let Carrie
wander around unprotected.

20:28.499 --> 20:30.900
If it's Nazir, what's he up to?

20:30.968 --> 20:33.069
Maybe Carrie's his bargaining chip

20:33.137 --> 20:34.904
to get himself out of the country.

20:34.972 --> 20:36.406
Then why haven't we heard from him?

20:36.473 --> 20:38.174
I don't know.

20:50.554 --> 20:52.955
Carrie?

20:52.990 --> 20:54.123
Is that you?

20:54.191 --> 20:55.792
Brody, this is Saul Berenson.

20:55.826 --> 20:57.627
I'm calling on her phone.

20:57.661 --> 20:59.629
Carrie's missing.

20:59.663 --> 21:02.765
Police found her car over
on 17th Street, smashed to shit.

21:02.833 --> 21:06.335
Looks like some kind
of hit-and-run.

21:06.370 --> 21:09.338
Last number she called was you.

21:09.373 --> 21:12.008
What she say? She tell you
where she was going?

21:13.343 --> 21:14.677
Brody, you there?

21:14.712 --> 21:16.446
Yeah, I'm here.

21:16.513 --> 21:18.147
Well, what did she say?

21:18.182 --> 21:21.678
Oh, she told me
it was time to tell Walden

21:21.679 --> 21:23.519
that I could no longer be
a candidate for VP.

21:23.587 --> 21:25.455
That's it?

21:25.522 --> 21:28.157
We also discussed
my resigning from Congress.

21:30.427 --> 21:32.795
If you hear from her again,
let me know.

21:32.863 --> 21:35.164
I will.

22:01.692 --> 22:05.862
What are you guys doing here?
In hiding or something?

22:05.896 --> 22:09.465
Turns out my dad is,
like, a super spy, and

22:09.533 --> 22:12.068
terrorists want
to kill him or some shit.

22:12.102 --> 22:13.736
I don't know.

22:16.039 --> 22:17.874
That sounds kind of insane.

22:17.941 --> 22:20.109
Doesn't it.

22:22.412 --> 22:25.214
How come you didn't
answer any of my texts?

22:34.558 --> 22:37.093
What do you want, Finn?

22:48.071 --> 22:50.406
Every morning I wake up,

22:50.440 --> 22:53.976
and for a few brief seconds, I'm free.

22:54.044 --> 22:57.246
I can just...
look at the sky,

22:57.281 --> 22:59.816
or... listen
to the birds.

23:02.886 --> 23:05.254
And then...

23:05.289 --> 23:07.623
wham.

23:09.726 --> 23:12.428
I remember the sound of that
woman hitting the windshield.

23:14.565 --> 23:16.899
I remember that I've killed

23:16.934 --> 23:19.902
another human being,

23:19.937 --> 23:22.271
and I can't take it back.

23:31.582 --> 23:34.650
You're the only one
I can talk to about it.

23:40.090 --> 23:43.292
It makes me sick that...

23:43.327 --> 23:45.628
you hate me.

23:47.831 --> 23:50.466
Did you know what your dad would do?

23:50.500 --> 23:53.135
That he would pay them off?

23:53.170 --> 23:56.272
That's how the world works.

24:06.583 --> 24:08.551
I didn't know that, I guess.

24:09.620 --> 24:12.655
Remember that night...

24:12.723 --> 24:14.624
top of the Washington Monument?

24:20.964 --> 24:22.932
Can't we start over?

24:24.701 --> 24:27.670
Whatever we felt...

24:27.738 --> 24:29.605
we broke it.

24:34.478 --> 24:36.479
We killed it...

24:36.546 --> 24:39.415
just the same way
that we killed that woman.

24:56.233 --> 24:57.700
That's Nazir less than 20 minutes

24:57.768 --> 24:59.168
before Carrie's accident.

24:59.236 --> 25:01.504
Security cameras caught him.

25:01.571 --> 25:02.538
That's his car.

25:02.606 --> 25:03.726
We traced the license plate.

25:03.740 --> 25:04.874
He probably used

25:04.942 --> 25:06.375
a fake ID;
it's a rental.

25:06.443 --> 25:07.877
Where is this place?

25:07.945 --> 25:09.345
Five blocks from where Carrie's car

25:09.346 --> 25:10.613
was hit on 17th Street.

25:15.452 --> 25:16.419
Fuck you doing here?

25:16.453 --> 25:17.933
You're supposed to be in Walter Reed.

25:17.934 --> 25:19.355
I heard about Carrie.

25:19.423 --> 25:20.623
I want to help.

25:23.293 --> 25:24.794
Here, take a look at this.

26:02.866 --> 26:04.834
No.

26:12.542 --> 26:14.477
As you please.

26:19.049 --> 26:21.550
This is what you did
to Brody, isn't it?

26:21.618 --> 26:25.054
A lot of pain, a little love.

26:25.088 --> 26:28.424
Am I supposed to feel grateful?

26:28.492 --> 26:30.359
I don't care what you feel.

26:32.863 --> 26:34.797
There's no way he can just waltz

26:34.865 --> 26:36.599
into the naval observatory and get you

26:36.666 --> 26:39.435
that serial number.

26:39.503 --> 26:42.271
He's a resourceful man
when he wants to be.

26:42.339 --> 26:44.540
Not that resourceful.

26:45.675 --> 26:48.711
He will do it to save you.

26:48.745 --> 26:49.945
You're going to kill me

26:50.013 --> 26:51.380
no matter what happens.

26:53.250 --> 26:55.217
Brody knows that.

26:55.252 --> 26:58.220
A man gambles with what he has.

27:03.627 --> 27:05.594
He will try.

27:05.629 --> 27:07.696
Don't be so sure.

27:09.266 --> 27:11.400
He's smarter than you think.

27:12.869 --> 27:14.770
You love him, too.

27:18.008 --> 27:20.476
Perhaps we have that in common.

27:20.544 --> 27:23.112
We have nothing in common.

27:26.383 --> 27:29.418
Sometimes, when you're breaking a man,

27:29.486 --> 27:32.988
an emotional transference takes place.

27:33.056 --> 27:37.793
For me, with Nicholas,
it was quite powerful.

27:37.828 --> 27:41.597
It was really a kind of love.

27:45.435 --> 27:48.003
You're never going to leave
this country alive.

27:49.773 --> 27:53.109
I know and I don't care.

27:54.978 --> 27:57.613
Bullshit.

28:09.593 --> 28:12.027
You can't even imagine that, can you?

28:12.095 --> 28:15.664
Believing in something bigger than you,

28:15.699 --> 28:18.167
more important than you?

28:18.201 --> 28:20.803
We are at war, I am a soldier.

28:20.871 --> 28:23.639
You're a terrorist.

28:26.309 --> 28:28.277
Imagine you are sitting down to dinner

28:28.311 --> 28:31.514
with your wife and children.

28:31.581 --> 28:33.282
Out of the sky,

28:33.350 --> 28:35.684
as if thrown by an angry god,

28:35.752 --> 28:39.488
a drone strike hits
and destroys all of them.

28:41.258 --> 28:43.392
Who is the terrorist?

28:47.264 --> 28:49.131
It's the last day of Ramadan.

28:50.300 --> 28:52.234
A young man enters a Shia village,

28:52.302 --> 28:55.204
pushing a cart full of candy and toys.

28:56.606 --> 28:58.541
He waits in the school playground

28:58.608 --> 28:59.975
for all the children to gather.

29:00.010 --> 29:03.512
Then he reaches back
and flips a switch.

29:03.580 --> 29:05.681
We fight with what we have.

29:05.715 --> 29:08.050
You pervert the teachings
of the Prophet

29:08.118 --> 29:10.653
and call it a cause.

29:10.687 --> 29:13.989
You turn teenagers
into suicide bombers.

29:14.024 --> 29:18.761
Generation after generation
must suffer and die.

29:18.828 --> 29:20.696
We are prepared for that.

29:20.730 --> 29:21.997
Are you?

29:23.500 --> 29:25.434
Whatever it takes.

29:28.705 --> 29:31.106
Really?

29:31.174 --> 29:34.577
With your pension plans
and organic foods,

29:34.644 --> 29:38.681
your beach houses and sports clubs?

29:38.715 --> 29:43.118
Do you have the perseverance,
the tenacity, the faith?

29:43.186 --> 29:45.020
Because we do.

29:45.055 --> 29:47.523
You can bomb us, starve us,

29:47.557 --> 29:50.593
occupy our holy places,

29:50.660 --> 29:53.729
but we will never lose our faith.

29:53.763 --> 29:57.733
We carry God in our hearts, our souls.

29:57.767 --> 30:01.537
To die is to join him.

30:01.605 --> 30:04.907
It may take a century, two centuries,

30:04.941 --> 30:07.543
three centuries,

30:07.611 --> 30:10.713
but we will exterminate you.

30:12.882 --> 30:15.451
Like I said...

30:15.518 --> 30:18.053
you're a terrorist.

30:34.971 --> 30:37.239
ID, please.

30:39.542 --> 30:41.477
Ma'am.

30:41.544 --> 30:44.913
I've got Congressman Brody
for the vice president.

31:35.131 --> 31:37.066
Stacy.

31:37.133 --> 31:39.034
- Congressman Brody.
- Hello.

31:39.063 --> 31:40.743
I'm sorry, but the
vice president's still

31:40.744 --> 31:42.184
in his meeting with Ambassador Elon.

31:42.185 --> 31:43.145
Oh, no worry, I'll wait.

31:43.173 --> 31:44.506
Might be a while.

31:44.541 --> 31:46.508
I don't mind.

31:55.952 --> 31:58.654
Can I get you anything...
water, lemonade?

31:58.688 --> 32:01.190
Double shot of your best bourbon.

32:01.224 --> 32:03.158
Just kidding, I'm fine.

32:29.152 --> 32:31.019
Nature calls.

32:41.831 --> 32:44.233
Gentlemen, bathroom?

32:44.267 --> 32:46.201
Thank you.

35:03.673 --> 35:05.607
Nicholas?

35:05.675 --> 35:07.009
I've got the number.

35:07.043 --> 35:08.343
Text it to me.

35:08.378 --> 35:09.678
Let Carrie go first.

35:09.712 --> 35:11.013
Text me the number,

35:11.047 --> 35:12.214
then I will let her go.

35:12.315 --> 35:14.049
No, you won't.

35:14.083 --> 35:16.003
Once you've got what you need,
you'll kill her.

35:16.004 --> 35:18.687
The minute I let her go,
you won't text me the number.

35:18.721 --> 35:21.857
God, you've got to trust me.

35:21.891 --> 35:24.459
How could I possibly trust you?

35:24.527 --> 35:26.094
Send me the number

35:26.162 --> 35:27.563
or I will kill her.

35:29.566 --> 35:32.768
Nazir, if you kill her,

35:32.835 --> 35:35.437
you will never get this number.

35:40.577 --> 35:43.478
You have five seconds.

35:43.546 --> 35:46.214
Listen to me, listen to me,
Nazir, listen.

35:49.953 --> 35:53.522
Let Carrie go and I swear
I will send it to you.

35:53.556 --> 35:56.091
I swear on the soul of Issa.

35:56.125 --> 35:58.794
Why would I believe that?

35:58.861 --> 36:01.330
Because you know how much I loved him.

36:01.397 --> 36:04.333
And because you know how much
I hate Walden.

36:04.400 --> 36:07.636
He deserves to die for what he did.

36:07.704 --> 36:09.571
And what he will do as president.

36:11.040 --> 36:12.708
Swear again.

36:12.742 --> 36:14.009
I swear. I swear.

36:14.043 --> 36:15.577
Swear on the immortal soul

36:15.612 --> 36:18.380
of my son Issa Mohammed.

36:19.515 --> 36:23.085
I swear. I s...

36:23.119 --> 36:25.087
I swear...

36:25.121 --> 36:27.155
on Issa's...

36:27.223 --> 36:29.091
immortal soul.

36:35.398 --> 36:37.265
Nazir?

36:45.908 --> 36:47.609
Nazir?!

36:53.583 --> 36:55.217
Go.

36:55.251 --> 36:56.284
Go!

36:57.887 --> 36:59.021
Go.

37:05.762 --> 37:07.562
Let me see her, goddamn it!

37:07.597 --> 37:11.066
I want to see her actually
getting away, Nazir.

37:14.604 --> 37:15.637
It's too dark.

37:15.705 --> 37:16.738
It's too dark, Nazir.

37:16.773 --> 37:17.806
I can't see her.

37:51.307 --> 37:53.909
She's gone.

37:53.976 --> 37:55.310
Send me the number.

38:00.817 --> 38:03.885
Send me the number now.

38:06.222 --> 38:08.023
Send me the number

38:08.057 --> 38:09.491
or I will go after her.

38:27.510 --> 38:29.377
Asshole!

39:15.725 --> 39:17.092
There you are.

39:17.126 --> 39:20.095
I thought you left.

39:20.129 --> 39:21.663
Getting a feel for the joint?

39:21.731 --> 39:23.865
Yeah. Hope you
don't mind.

39:23.900 --> 39:25.167
Not at all.

39:25.234 --> 39:26.568
Be yours soon enough.

39:37.380 --> 39:38.947
You all right?
What's the matter?

39:38.981 --> 39:40.582
Yeah, I'm fine.

39:42.652 --> 39:44.719
How was, uh... how was
your meeting with, uh,

39:44.754 --> 39:46.354
Ambassador Elon?

39:46.422 --> 39:48.323
We're getting close.

39:48.391 --> 39:50.058
Another week or so,

39:50.092 --> 39:52.994
we'll be ready to deliver
the bunker buster Israel needs

39:53.062 --> 39:55.831
to take out Iran's nuclear
enrichment plant at Natanz.

39:55.898 --> 39:57.499
I thought that was off the table.

39:57.567 --> 39:59.901
It was.

39:59.936 --> 40:02.971
Estes told me what you did for CIA.

40:03.005 --> 40:05.106
Not the details, of course, but...

40:05.141 --> 40:08.376
he said you were instrumental in
bringing down Nazir's network.

40:08.444 --> 40:10.712
I was able to help a little, yes.

40:10.780 --> 40:13.315
How do you manage to do all that
and keep it to yourself?

40:13.349 --> 40:15.851
I don't know.

40:15.918 --> 40:17.652
As soon as I can get

40:17.687 --> 40:19.054
that operation declassified,

40:19.121 --> 40:20.989
we are gonna tell
this whole fucking country

40:21.023 --> 40:22.691
what you did.

40:22.758 --> 40:25.293
"Marine Fights Terrorists
at Home as Well as Abroad."

40:28.464 --> 40:29.831
What did you want to see me about?

40:29.866 --> 40:31.833
Right.

40:31.868 --> 40:33.902
Right, um...

40:33.970 --> 40:36.705
Well, sir, uh...

40:36.772 --> 40:38.540
I'm afraid...

40:38.608 --> 40:41.176
that in fact this can never be mine.

40:42.311 --> 40:43.778
Why not?

40:43.813 --> 40:45.580
Because...

40:45.648 --> 40:48.250
I've decided to withdraw my name
from consideration

40:48.317 --> 40:50.051
for the VP spot.

40:50.119 --> 40:52.854
I'm sorry, sir.

40:52.889 --> 40:54.623
It's for my family.

40:54.657 --> 40:57.092
Fuck your family.

40:57.159 --> 41:00.128
We're talking about the second
highest office in this land,

41:00.162 --> 41:03.131
the possibility someday of
the highest office in this land.

41:03.165 --> 41:04.966
You don't walk away from that.

41:05.001 --> 41:07.636
Not for anyone.

41:21.417 --> 41:23.885
You okay?

41:25.988 --> 41:28.490
I don't know.

41:32.862 --> 41:35.597
Actually, it's not for my family.

41:35.665 --> 41:37.198
It's for me.

41:41.837 --> 41:45.640
Because I want to feel clean again.

41:45.708 --> 41:47.943
And because I pretty much

41:48.010 --> 41:51.212
disagree with everything
you say and do.

41:59.388 --> 42:01.690
That's very funny.

42:01.724 --> 42:04.326
You got some balls, Brody.
I'll give you that.

42:04.360 --> 42:05.593
I'm not joking.

42:22.078 --> 42:24.045
Call a doctor.

42:25.181 --> 42:26.381
I don't think so.

42:27.550 --> 42:28.917
Goddamn...

42:32.555 --> 42:33.855
What are you doing?

42:33.889 --> 42:34.956
Huh?

42:35.024 --> 42:36.257
What are you doing?!

42:42.298 --> 42:44.366
You still don't get it, do you?

42:54.477 --> 42:57.178
I'm killing you.

43:40.989 --> 43:42.879
Are you fucking nuts? Jesus.

43:42.880 --> 43:44.920
- What happened to you?
- Give me your cell phone.

43:44.921 --> 43:46.601
I'm not giving you
my fucking cell phone.

43:46.602 --> 43:48.122
This is a matter of national security.

43:48.123 --> 43:49.403
Give me your fucking cell phone!

43:49.404 --> 43:51.566
No! Hey! Hey!
Come back with that!

43:56.305 --> 43:57.238
Yeah.

43:57.306 --> 43:58.840
Saul, it's Carrie.

43:58.874 --> 44:00.208
Carrie, where the fuck are you?

44:00.242 --> 44:01.742
Abu Nazir is in an abandoned mill.

44:01.810 --> 44:02.777
Where?

44:02.845 --> 44:04.365
- I have no idea.
- Give me my phone,

44:04.366 --> 44:05.526
- you bitch!
- Where are we?

44:05.527 --> 44:07.148
- Where the fuck are we?!
- What?

44:07.182 --> 44:08.349
We're on Highway 50.

44:08.383 --> 44:09.817
Where on Highway 50?

44:09.852 --> 44:11.285
East of Chantilly.

44:11.353 --> 44:12.887
Highway 50, east of Chantilly.

44:12.996 --> 44:14.036
We'll find you.
Stay put.

44:14.037 --> 44:16.491
Do not go after Nazir.
We're on our way.

44:16.525 --> 44:18.426
Highway 50, east of Chantilly.

44:20.028 --> 44:21.062
Here.

44:21.096 --> 44:23.064
I'm sorry.
It was an emergency.

44:23.131 --> 44:24.398
"National emergency."

44:25.567 --> 44:28.269
East of Chantilly, east of Chantilly.

44:28.337 --> 44:29.941
- 50, 50.
- There.

44:29.942 --> 44:32.302
Dalton's Mill. Halfway between
Middleburg and Chantilly...

44:32.303 --> 44:34.703
Okay, call state police and
tell 'em to surround the place.

44:34.710 --> 44:36.750
Then grab every available body
and get over there!

44:36.812 --> 44:38.279
- Yes, sir.
- I'll alert the FBI

44:38.347 --> 44:39.747
and the rest of Homeland Security.

45:15.183 --> 45:17.785
Hey, get a doctor!
I need a doctor!

45:17.853 --> 45:20.588
The vice president is having
a heart attack!

45:20.656 --> 45:22.690
Will somebody get a doctor?!

45:31.767 --> 45:33.267
- Saul Berenson?
- Yes?

45:33.335 --> 45:34.435
You're wanted upstairs.

45:34.469 --> 45:35.736
Upstairs? What for?

45:35.804 --> 45:37.505
It's important. That's
all they told me.

45:37.539 --> 45:38.939
I'm on my way to catch a terrorist.

45:39.007 --> 45:40.567
What could be more important than that?

45:40.568 --> 45:41.208
They didn't say.

45:41.209 --> 45:42.143
Jesus Christ.

45:42.177 --> 45:43.672
Go ahead. I'll catch up.

45:43.673 --> 45:45.433
- Who's asking for me?
- I don't know, sir.

45:45.468 --> 45:47.748
What do you mean you don't know?
Who told you to get me?

45:47.749 --> 45:49.629
They just want to ask
you some questions, sir.

45:49.630 --> 45:51.018
Questions? They?

45:51.046 --> 45:52.486
What the fuck are you talking about?

45:52.521 --> 45:54.201
There's a room waiting
for us downstairs.

45:54.235 --> 45:55.955
I thought you said
we were going upstairs.

45:55.956 --> 45:58.359
Who the fuck... Hey, hey!
Get your fucking hands off me.

46:04.433 --> 46:06.400
Call Deputy Director Estes.

46:06.435 --> 46:07.835
He'll straighten this out.

46:07.869 --> 46:09.270
He's fully aware.
