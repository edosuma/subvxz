04:25.000 --> 04:27.600
Stare at this for a while,
you ugly bastard.

04:43.800 --> 04:44.800
What are you doing here?

04:45.600 --> 04:46.900
I'm taking the specimen.

04:47.100 --> 04:48.900
No. I haven't prepped
the chamber.

04:50.400 --> 04:53.300
I don't want him frozen.
I want him soft.

04:54.400 --> 04:56.100
We've already discussed this.

04:56.500 --> 04:58.500
I had to go
over your head.

04:58.700 --> 05:00.600
I'm moving him
to our Scranton Facility.

05:00.800 --> 05:02.900
You can't risk taking him
through open country.

05:03.200 --> 05:04.600
This isn't open for discussion.

05:05.500 --> 05:08.200
His unique ability
to regenerate

05:08.400 --> 05:12.100
lost and damaged tissue.
It just cries out for more research.

05:12.300 --> 05:15.000
You'll risk the deaths
of innocent civilians if he escapes.

05:15.500 --> 05:16.300
Yes.

05:16.600 --> 05:18.600
But I'm sure Sergeant Marcus
and his men

05:18.800 --> 05:20.700
can handle the transfer
just fine.

05:20.900 --> 05:23.300
-Sergeant?
-Everything's under control, ma'am.

05:26.900 --> 05:29.900
-Dr. Wimmer, please.
-He's no longer your problem.

05:43.600 --> 05:45.300
Can we get that rag off him?

05:57.800 --> 05:59.100
What the hell?

06:24.800 --> 06:26.000
Oh, my God!

06:30.500 --> 06:31.800
Get out of here.

06:32.500 --> 06:33.300
What happened?

06:34.500 --> 06:35.600
I'm sorry.

08:30.400 --> 08:31.300
Cryogenic breach.

08:31.700 --> 08:33.400
Emergency lock-down.

08:37.100 --> 08:38.299
Oh, God, no!

08:40.700 --> 08:41.500
No.

10:27.400 --> 10:28.400
Kay-Em?

10:28.700 --> 10:30.700
No viruses, no bacteria.

10:31.200 --> 10:32.800
No toxins. It's clean.

10:39.200 --> 10:40.900
-It's still cold.
-Wow.

10:43.800 --> 10:45.100
What is that?

10:45.600 --> 10:48.300
It's like a big kind

10:48.600 --> 10:50.100
kind of frozen storage thing?

10:50.800 --> 10:52.500
Probably a cryostasis unit.

10:52.800 --> 10:54.700
I'd guess
early Port series.

10:55.100 --> 10:57.500
Quadroport 11.
Manufactured in 2010.

10:57.700 --> 11:00.100
Precise historic records
are inconsistent.

11:03.400 --> 11:05.000
Anyone thinking
what I'm thinking?

11:05.700 --> 11:06.300
Open it up.

11:24.700 --> 11:27.100
-What the hell is that?
-Humanoid.

11:27.700 --> 11:29.300
Organic composition
is unclear.

11:29.600 --> 11:31.100
What's on his face?

11:33.200 --> 11:36.600
Some kind of 20th-century
carbon filtration unit?

11:37.600 --> 11:38.900
It's a hockey mask.

11:39.600 --> 11:40.700
Very good, Tsunaron.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.500
-What's a hockey mask?
-Facial armor

11:44.700 --> 11:46.900
Used in a sport outlawed
in 2024.

11:48.400 --> 11:49.300
Amazing.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.600
Absolute museum-quality.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.900
Are you paying attention,
Azrael?

11:57.500 --> 11:58.300
Yeah.

11:59.500 --> 12:00.700
Well, don't touch anything.

12:21.400 --> 12:22.000
Guys.

12:22.600 --> 12:23.800
We got another body here.

12:31.600 --> 12:32.300
Kay-Em?

12:32.600 --> 12:34.200
She's perfectly preserved.

12:34.400 --> 12:36.500
Cell Crystallization
is at 25 percent.

12:36.800 --> 12:37.900
25 percent?

12:38.200 --> 12:40.800
Suggest nanotech and phase
one cell reconstruction.

12:41.500 --> 12:42.700
Wait... Wait a minute, are you...

12:43.400 --> 12:44.900
...are you saying that...

12:45.700 --> 12:47.800
-...we can bring her back to life?
-Yes.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.500
But she is deteriorating.
Opening the door has compromised

12:50.700 --> 12:51.700
her hibernation.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.500
Lou, get ready for dust-off.
We have a priority evac.

12:54.700 --> 12:56.200
Copy that, ready in five.

12:56.400 --> 12:57.500
Not five, now.

13:01.200 --> 13:02.200
What the...?

13:03.900 --> 13:04.500
Look out!

13:11.000 --> 13:13.300
55 cc's of etherene. You'll be fine.

13:13.500 --> 13:15.600
Fine? I'm missing my arm!

13:24.000 --> 13:25.500
Oh, you're so pretty.

13:48.200 --> 13:50.800
-Are the doors secure?
-Locked and blocked.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.200
Beautiful.

13:52.400 --> 13:55.300
Lift off in three,
two...

13:55.900 --> 13:57.300
Yeah!

14:01.600 --> 14:04.200
I love this part.

14:10.800 --> 14:13.000
-What'd you find?
-You won't believe it.

14:13.500 --> 14:15.100
Get the sarge on the horn.

14:15.600 --> 14:18.400
Division four just entered
the occupied zone.

14:18.600 --> 14:20.100
-Casualties?
-Minimal.

14:20.400 --> 14:22.100
How'd we get this screwed-up gig?

14:22.400 --> 14:25.100
I didn't join the corps
to be a babysitter.

14:32.400 --> 14:33.200
-Brodski,

14:33.500 --> 14:34.600
-Sarge, we found a viable.

14:34.800 --> 14:35.500
Say again?

14:35.800 --> 14:38.200
We found two bodies
in deep cryostasis.

14:38.400 --> 14:40.900
Kay-Em unit thinks we can
resuscitate the female.

14:41.300 --> 14:42.300
Female?

14:43.900 --> 14:44.900
Yeah.

14:45.400 --> 14:46.300
Crutch, do you copy?

14:48.000 --> 14:49.200
Crutch, do you read me?

14:50.500 --> 14:51.600
Wake the hell up.

14:52.500 --> 14:54.100
-Yeah, what do you want?
-They're on their way back.

14:54.300 --> 14:55.500
Power up the lab.

14:56.100 --> 14:58.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Whatever.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.200
-What does she look like?
-She's cute.

15:21.400 --> 15:22.300
Yeah.

15:22.800 --> 15:23.700
And single.

15:29.800 --> 15:30.900
I'm so lonely.

15:54.600 --> 15:56.100
We need to get her to the lab.

16:01.400 --> 16:04.100
-You think you can bring her back?
-We'll find out, sergeant.

16:07.800 --> 16:10.700
-You won't bring him back, will you?
-No, it's impossible.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.500
Aw, shit. I forgot my arm.

16:15.700 --> 16:17.900
Yeah, here you go, dumb-ass.

16:18.700 --> 16:19.800
Hi, hand.

16:22.100 --> 16:24.900
-Any idea how long she's been down?
-4.55 centuries.

16:25.400 --> 16:27.200
Must've been one hell
of a wake-up call.

16:27.400 --> 16:30.300
-I'm bitchy as hell when I wake up.
-Did you just wake up?

16:35.200 --> 16:36.200
Kinsa.

16:36.400 --> 16:39.100
-You guys always find the cool shit.
-Where's Waylander?

16:39.300 --> 16:41.100
He's in lab one,
charging the bed now.

16:41.300 --> 16:43.500
Find Stoney and Adrienne
and get to lab two.

16:44.300 --> 16:47.000
Once we're in the clear, I'd like
to check your circuits.

16:47.200 --> 16:49.800
-I'll bet you would.
-It isn't like that.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.600
I need you in lab two.

16:53.800 --> 16:55.300
-You found something?
-Two viables.

16:55.500 --> 16:57.700
-In what condition?
-Perfect. We're attempting reanimation.

16:57.900 --> 16:59.700
-What can I do?
-You, Stoney and Kinsa...

16:59.900 --> 17:02.900
-They'll slow me down.
- Just walk them through it, okay?

17:03.200 --> 17:06.000
Run a structural scan
and log them in.

17:06.200 --> 17:07.599
-I'll check back later.
-Fine.

17:11.000 --> 17:14.099
-Okay, where are we?
-Board's all green. The N-2's ready.

17:14.300 --> 17:16.099
Begin stabilizing

17:16.300 --> 17:18.099
-cell fractures.
-Yes, professor.

17:18.599 --> 17:21.500
I need a scan. Glycerol levels,
cerebral profusion...

17:21.700 --> 17:24.099
-...the works.
-I live to serve.

17:24.300 --> 17:27.200
-Let's see what we have here.
Decrystalization of the membranes is

17:27.400 --> 17:28.300
at 32 percent.

17:28.600 --> 17:30.300
-Somebody get her clothes off.
-I got it!

17:31.400 --> 17:32.400
I got it.

17:33.100 --> 17:34.300
Honestly.

17:34.500 --> 17:36.800
Where's her diffusion barriers?

17:38.100 --> 17:39.300
Seventeen and stable.

17:39.900 --> 17:40.900
Here we go.

17:45.100 --> 17:48.100
Stay still or you'll get an elbow where
elbow where your wrist should be.

17:53.600 --> 17:57.400
Specimen 4420 found in sector 39-30 L
on Earth prime.

17:57.600 --> 17:59.600
Subject discovered
in cryosuspension.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.300
-How's it going?
-Good. What's up?

18:31.000 --> 18:33.500
-Where do you want this?
-On the specimen table.

18:34.100 --> 18:35.700
-Hi, baby.
-Hey, gorgeous.

18:36.900 --> 18:38.000
Initiating scan.

18:41.400 --> 18:43.300
Smart and sexy.

18:44.900 --> 18:45.600
Professor.

18:45.800 --> 18:48.100
Take a look at this guy's
scan.

18:51.000 --> 18:51.900
Amazing.

18:53.200 --> 18:54.800
How'd he function
with that small brain?

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
-Way manages.
-That's very funny.

18:57.600 --> 18:58.800
He's a big boy.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
I bet he's hung
like a mammoth.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.900
Get out of here and come back
when you're focused.

19:12.100 --> 19:13.900
-You serious?
-Yes, just go.

19:14.400 --> 19:16.300
-Thanks, Adrienne.
-Thanks.

19:16.600 --> 19:17.900
Don't mention it.

19:18.400 --> 19:20.300
See what you can salvage
from the optic cortex.

19:20.500 --> 19:22.600
-Then move on.
-My pleasure, professor.

19:23.300 --> 19:24.300
Ready phase two.

19:28.200 --> 19:29.200
Bring on the ants.

19:58.200 --> 19:58.800
That's it.

19:59.200 --> 20:00.300
Come to mama.

20:21.400 --> 20:23.200
Temperature, 96.2.

20:23.400 --> 20:24.600
97.

20:25.000 --> 20:25.900
Cool. It's working.

20:26.400 --> 20:28.000
98.6 and holding.

20:28.600 --> 20:30.900
Cell reconstruction is complete.
Internal defib

20:31.100 --> 20:32.300
in three...

20:33.200 --> 20:34.800
two, one.

21:06.800 --> 21:07.900
Easy. Easy.

21:10.700 --> 21:12.600
Vital signs are normal
and strong.

21:13.400 --> 21:14.400
No shit.

21:15.100 --> 21:15.700
Easy.

21:16.500 --> 21:17.500
Easy.

21:18.300 --> 21:19.400
Did ya get him?

21:20.100 --> 21:21.500
Where is he?
Tell me you got him.

21:21.700 --> 21:22.400
Got who?

21:22.800 --> 21:24.800
No one's here.
You're safe with us.

21:27.800 --> 21:30.400
There was a leak
in the cryo-unit and...

21:32.800 --> 21:34.000
Was he contained?

21:34.900 --> 21:36.100
It was contained.

21:36.400 --> 21:39.100
But when the cryo-unit ruptured,
you didn't escape it.

21:39.400 --> 21:40.900
It put you into stasis.

21:43.200 --> 21:44.300
For how long?

21:47.500 --> 21:49.200
The year is 2455.

21:50.400 --> 21:52.800
Now, I know this
is a huge shock...

21:53.900 --> 21:55.300
but you'll be safe here.

21:58.600 --> 22:01.600
You're aboard Grendel, a class-four,
catamaran transport ship.

22:02.800 --> 22:04.300
We're on our way back home and...

22:05.200 --> 22:06.900
you'll be just fine.

22:15.400 --> 22:16.900
2455?

22:21.800 --> 22:23.700
That's over 400 years.

22:32.200 --> 22:34.400
Secure line. Perez, Dieter.

22:34.600 --> 22:36.900
Solaris Research Station.
Connect.

22:46.400 --> 22:48.600
Lowe. You bastard.

22:49.100 --> 22:50.700
We've hit the mother lode.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.700
Do you know what time it is?

22:52.900 --> 22:54.800
I don't care.
We've got a goldmine.

22:55.100 --> 22:57.300
A box of DVDs

22:57.800 --> 23:00.800
is not a goldmine.
I've told you, I can't move them.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
Look at the file.

23:02.500 --> 23:05.000
Two 400-year-old frozen specimens.
One well-preserved...

23:05.200 --> 23:06.300
One well-preserved,

23:06.800 --> 23:10.200
the other one, are you ready
for this? Up and walking around.

23:10.400 --> 23:11.700
400 years old

23:12.000 --> 23:13.700
and walking around.

23:14.400 --> 23:16.800
Yeah. 455 years,
to be exact.

23:17.500 --> 23:19.700
Who cares? Who gives a shit?

23:19.900 --> 23:22.400
People. They'll pay huge money
to see her.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.700
Let me ask you a question.

23:24.900 --> 23:27.800
Is this the first person
you've reanimated?

23:28.000 --> 23:28.800
Of course not.

23:29.200 --> 23:31.500
How many people
are out there today...

23:31.700 --> 23:34.400
walking around thawed out
and looking good?

23:34.900 --> 23:35.200
-Hundreds.

23:35.300 --> 23:36.000
-Thousands.

23:36.200 --> 23:38.400
Maybe.
But not 450 years old.

23:38.600 --> 23:40.700
She's nearly twice
as old as anyone.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.900
250, 450.

23:43.200 --> 23:43.900
-What's the difference?

23:44.100 --> 23:44.900
-Doctor,

23:45.200 --> 23:47.600
a hundred years ago, when
reanimation was...

23:47.900 --> 23:50.200
more unpredictable...
sure, maybe.

23:50.400 --> 23:51.200
But now...

23:51.400 --> 23:52.900
it's old news.

23:53.800 --> 23:55.700
Damn it. I need money.

23:55.900 --> 23:59.300
Oh, I know. I know.

24:01.300 --> 24:04.500
The other viable
is marked "Voorhees."

24:05.400 --> 24:07.700
That's not Jason Voorhees,
is it?

24:08.100 --> 24:09.300
What do you know about him?

24:09.600 --> 24:11.100
Jason Voorhees.

24:12.900 --> 24:15.500
He killed
nearly 200 people...

24:15.700 --> 24:18.100
and simply disappeared
without a trace.

24:18.800 --> 24:21.900
Why, to the right buyer
he could be worth a fortune.

24:24.100 --> 24:25.800
I've got him frozen here
on the ship.

24:26.100 --> 24:27.600
You work out a list
of ownership?

24:28.100 --> 24:31.400
No list. He's my find.
He's mine.

24:31.600 --> 24:32.700
What about your students?

24:32.900 --> 24:36.300
They're students. The educational
experience will be enough.

24:36.700 --> 24:39.600
Doctor, doctor,
you are one son of a bitch.

24:39.800 --> 24:41.300
Soon to be one rich son
of a bitch.

24:41.500 --> 24:42.500
Lowe out.

24:46.600 --> 24:47.500
Professor,

24:48.000 --> 24:49.700
I think that...

24:50.300 --> 24:53.100
we need to talk
about my midterm.

25:37.600 --> 25:40.400
Poor baby. No wonder
you wore this thing.

25:47.400 --> 25:50.500
Harder. Harder.

25:50.700 --> 25:54.300
-Who's been a naughty little boy?
-I have.

25:55.800 --> 25:56.900
Harder.

25:57.100 --> 26:00.100
-A little harder? How's that?
-Yeah.

26:00.300 --> 26:01.800
-Oh, good.
-How's that?

26:02.000 --> 26:02.800
Yeah!

26:03.000 --> 26:05.600
-Daddy wants it hard?
-Yeah!

26:06.200 --> 26:07.400
-Yeah. That's it.
-Right there?

26:08.000 --> 26:09.200
-You like it right there?
-Yeah.

26:09.400 --> 26:11.100
A little harder for daddy?

26:11.300 --> 26:12.200
Come on!

26:12.400 --> 26:14.700
-Come on!
-You pass!

27:09.600 --> 27:10.800
What do you think?

27:11.400 --> 27:13.300
-Do you like them?
-They're fine.

27:17.800 --> 27:20.100
Look, Kay-Em, I don't think
this is going to work.

27:21.100 --> 27:23.700
-Why do you want those things?
-Janessa has them.

27:23.900 --> 27:25.600
-Well, Janessa's...
-Real?

27:26.000 --> 27:26.900
Yes.

27:27.700 --> 27:29.500
Let's not complicate things,
all right?

27:30.300 --> 27:32.000
I like you just
the way you are.

27:32.400 --> 27:33.700
I think you're perfect.

27:34.300 --> 27:35.000
Okay.

29:07.700 --> 29:10.000
Help, Wayland! No!

29:10.300 --> 29:12.000
Somebody help!

29:12.600 --> 29:14.900
Help me! No!

29:18.300 --> 29:19.900
No! No!

29:59.100 --> 30:00.500
I brought you something
to eat.

30:02.500 --> 30:04.100
Soon we'll be
at Earth Two.

30:05.100 --> 30:07.300
Earth Two? What happened
to Earth One?

30:08.300 --> 30:09.600
Yeah, well, it's dead.

30:09.800 --> 30:11.500
The oceans, the soil,
either will sustain life.

30:13.000 --> 30:14.600
Can I do anything else
for you?

30:35.200 --> 30:36.500
You want to tell me
what happened?

30:36.800 --> 30:38.900
I take it being stabbed
and frozen

30:39.200 --> 30:41.100
-wasn't part of your plan.
-I'm a...

30:42.300 --> 30:45.600
I was a project leader
at Crystal Lake Research.

30:46.100 --> 30:47.500
The subject
as Jason Voorhees.

30:48.200 --> 30:49.200
Jason Voorhees?

30:50.200 --> 30:51.400
Notorious murderer?

30:54.000 --> 30:56.500
We executed him
for the first time in 2008.

30:56.800 --> 30:58.000
For the first time?

30:58.400 --> 30:59.600
We tried everything.

30:59.800 --> 31:02.500
Electrocution,
gas, firing squad.

31:03.100 --> 31:05.600
We even hung him once.
Nothing worked.

31:06.500 --> 31:09.400
We couldn't terminate him,
so we decided to contain him.

31:09.600 --> 31:11.100
Cryogenic stasis.

31:11.300 --> 31:12.900
Freeze him until we could figure
out what to do.

31:13.100 --> 31:13.900
Seems sensible.

31:14.100 --> 31:15.100
I thought so.

31:15.700 --> 31:18.500
Unfortunately some people who were
too smart for their own good...

31:19.900 --> 31:22.500
felt that a creature
that couldn't be killed was.

31:22.700 --> 31:24.000
too valuable
to file away.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.100
In the end, it always
comes down to money.

31:33.600 --> 31:35.900
How do you thank someone
who gives you back your life?

31:37.400 --> 31:40.200
You'll be alive for a long time.
We'll figure out something.

31:47.400 --> 31:50.600
Why don't you just admit it?
You want me.

31:52.000 --> 31:55.000
I could never be with a girl whose
balls are bigger than mine.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.900
Guys, our star patient is back.
Tsunaron and Janessa.

32:02.700 --> 32:03.600
-Hi.
-Hi.

32:03.800 --> 32:06.500
I see that my clothes
fit okay.

32:06.800 --> 32:09.000
These are yours. They're great.
Thank you.

32:12.200 --> 32:15.000
-What are those?
-These are Janessa's love children.

32:16.000 --> 32:17.100
You see now,

32:17.300 --> 32:21.100
it is that wit of yours that is
what repels all human females.

32:21.300 --> 32:22.900
And you've met
Sergeant Brodski.

32:23.400 --> 32:25.100
-Yes. Hi, again.
-Hi.

32:25.300 --> 32:27.900
And this
is the lovely Kay-Em 14.

32:28.200 --> 32:30.100
Tsunaron's little
love-bot.

32:30.300 --> 32:32.200
Easy, Janessa.

32:32.400 --> 32:34.800
Kay-Em is a knowledge
matrix android.

32:35.000 --> 32:37.600
-that I have been programing.
-Amazing.

32:40.800 --> 32:42.300
She looks so real.

32:42.700 --> 32:43.700
I am real.

32:43.900 --> 32:46.000
-Professor, where do you want this?
-Lab two.

32:46.200 --> 32:47.800
Where did you get that?

32:48.000 --> 32:49.900
From your friend,
with the hockey mask.

32:50.700 --> 32:52.000
You brought him
on board?

32:52.200 --> 32:53.800
He's in the next lab.
We're safe.

32:54.000 --> 32:54.800
Safe?

32:55.100 --> 32:57.700
Our scans reveal him
to be very dead.

32:59.200 --> 33:00.800
Could your scans be wrong?

33:02.100 --> 33:04.400
Get rid of him.
He's too dangerous.

33:05.000 --> 33:07.300
That would be irresponsible
and foolhardy.

33:07.700 --> 33:10.600
He's a valuable scientific artifact
that must be carefully preserved.

33:11.500 --> 33:12.500
Much like yourself.

33:14.800 --> 33:16.500
He is an unstoppable
killing machine.

33:17.700 --> 33:18.800
He's not dead.

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
Believe me.
He's definitely dead.

33:22.800 --> 33:23.900
Show me.

33:26.500 --> 33:27.900
I'm putting us
on lock-down.

33:28.100 --> 33:29.900
Attention, we have
a hostile on board.

33:30.200 --> 33:31.100
-Grunt team, report to weapons.

33:31.200 --> 33:32.100
-The chick?

33:32.300 --> 33:34.300
Repeat, we have
a hostile on board.

33:34.500 --> 33:35.900
Grunt team, report to weapons.

33:36.100 --> 33:38.100
Everyone else, get to lab one.

33:39.500 --> 33:41.600
-Baby, I'm not ready yet.
-Hurry up.

33:59.400 --> 34:01.900
Grunt team's assembled.
Dallas is a no-show.

34:02.100 --> 34:03.500
-Sergeant.
-Where the hell is he?

34:03.600 --> 34:04.200
-I don't know, sarge.

34:04.300 --> 34:04.900
-Damn.

34:05.200 --> 34:06.300
Look, sergeant,
we need to talk.

34:06.500 --> 34:08.600
-Do you have all your kids yet?
-Yes.

34:08.800 --> 34:09.699
Oh, God!

34:12.699 --> 34:13.699
Stoney...

34:14.300 --> 34:16.300
-Stoney's dead.
-Oh, my God.

34:16.500 --> 34:17.699
Stoney's dead.

34:19.100 --> 34:21.600
Kicker! I want full armor
and tac.

34:21.800 --> 34:24.100
I want nothing left of this guy
by the time we reach Solaris.

34:24.300 --> 34:26.100
Roger that.
Let's get moving!

34:26.400 --> 34:28.600
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Nothing left of him?

34:29.300 --> 34:32.500
Take your kids to lab one and stay
there till you hear from me.

35:37.700 --> 35:39.300
I just saved your ass.

35:40.000 --> 35:41.300
Don't get cocky.

35:41.500 --> 35:44.300
You must feel like a wuss,
huh, big boy?

35:44.500 --> 35:46.100
-Check the score. It's still 9-3.
-Yeah,

35:46.400 --> 35:48.800
but I got my groove
on now.

35:49.200 --> 35:50.900
So, what do you say
next kill wins?

35:51.100 --> 35:52.000
Lock and load, killer.

35:52.800 --> 35:55.200
You're going down.
You are so going down.

35:59.800 --> 36:00.600
What the hell?

36:01.200 --> 36:03.700
-I thought this was an alien sim.
-Yeah, it is.

36:04.100 --> 36:05.300
Pause play.

36:07.500 --> 36:09.700
-I said, pause play.
-He's not pausing.

36:09.900 --> 36:10.500
No kidding.

36:12.300 --> 36:14.200
I think we need to reboot.

36:17.100 --> 36:18.500
That does not count
as a kill.

36:18.700 --> 36:19.700
Yes it does.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.400
Okay, screw this.
Game over.

36:40.100 --> 36:41.300
What the hell?

36:45.000 --> 36:46.900
Drop the kid!

36:47.400 --> 36:48.700
Drop the kid! Now!

36:53.800 --> 36:55.400
Azrael, get out of here!

36:59.800 --> 37:02.500
-I got him! I got him!
-I got no shot!

37:03.400 --> 37:04.400
Move!

37:18.600 --> 37:19.600
Sergeant Brodski.

37:19.900 --> 37:22.300
Don't leave those kids alone.
What's wrong with you?

37:22.500 --> 37:23.700
We're near Solaris.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
They have
7 fully equipped unit

37:26.200 --> 37:27.700
that can deal with this.

37:27.900 --> 37:29.200
I say we wait
and sedate him.

37:29.800 --> 37:32.200
-I am taking this guy out.
-I need him alive.

37:32.400 --> 37:34.700
What you need is to get out
of my way.

37:35.000 --> 37:36.600
Look, there
are other considerations.

37:37.400 --> 37:38.700
Financial considerations.

37:39.600 --> 37:42.800
My only consideration is the safety
of the people on this ship.

37:45.000 --> 37:46.400
All right, a hundred thousand.

37:47.700 --> 37:48.600
Two hundred.

37:49.600 --> 37:51.600
-Five.
-Five?

37:57.900 --> 37:59.500
-Dallas not here yet?
-Nope.

37:59.800 --> 38:01.400
Briggs, find him,
bring him up to speed.

38:01.600 --> 38:03.000
Condor, you have a BFG?

38:03.200 --> 38:06.100
You're with me. Sven, Geko,
you got the starboard pontoon.

38:06.300 --> 38:08.100
Sarge, what do we do
when we find him?

38:08.600 --> 38:10.600
I promised the doc
we'd take him alive.

38:12.700 --> 38:13.300
Man!

38:13.500 --> 38:16.700
So, after you blow him to hell, put
one in his leg so we can say we tried.

38:16.900 --> 38:17.800
Yeah.

38:49.200 --> 38:50.900
-Sarge, I got Dallas.

38:51.000 --> 38:51.700
-Where the hell is he?

38:52.300 --> 38:52.900
He's dead.

38:57.400 --> 38:58.800
Sarge, we got a body
in bay two.

38:59.300 --> 39:00.100
-Who is it?

39:00.200 --> 39:00.800
-It's Azrael.

39:01.000 --> 39:02.800
What the hell's going on?

39:04.400 --> 39:07.000
Got a blood trail heading
toward the cargo bay.

39:07.400 --> 39:09.500
Condor, Kicker
and I will take cargo.

39:09.800 --> 39:11.000
Rest of you take portside.

39:12.200 --> 39:13.700
I hope they know
what they're doing.

39:14.700 --> 39:16.400
These guys live
for this stuff.

39:23.700 --> 39:24.700
Sorry.

39:27.400 --> 39:28.700
-Don't do that!
-Dude.

39:28.900 --> 39:30.900
-What?
-You scream like a girl.

39:31.100 --> 39:33.400
-Screw you.
-You wish.

39:58.400 --> 39:59.700
Lou, is that you?

40:17.600 --> 40:19.600
I swear, you mess
with an engineer...

40:19.800 --> 40:22.600
you'll wake up with a waste hose
in your bunk.

40:24.800 --> 40:25.800
Asshole.

40:46.800 --> 40:47.900
What the hell?

40:48.600 --> 40:50.200
Crutch, get down now!

41:15.600 --> 41:17.400
-What the hell's going on here?
-Crutch,

41:18.200 --> 41:18.800
out now!

41:23.300 --> 41:25.200
You wrecked my stuff, man.

41:30.800 --> 41:32.400
We nailed him.
He must be here.

41:37.000 --> 41:38.300
Condor, airborne.

41:39.000 --> 41:40.000
Briggs.

42:43.000 --> 42:44.100
Where the hell's Sven?

42:48.600 --> 42:49.600
Condor, anything topside?

42:54.200 --> 42:55.000
Negative, sarge.

42:55.500 --> 42:56.700
No sign of him.

42:59.300 --> 43:00.500
This won't work.

43:13.100 --> 43:14.500
Keep your eyes peeled.

43:21.000 --> 43:22.500
Everything's under control.

43:39.300 --> 43:41.100
Condor, report.

43:42.700 --> 43:43.800
Sven, report.

43:45.200 --> 43:46.500
Condor, report.

43:48.200 --> 43:49.300
Report!

43:50.400 --> 43:51.400
Damn!

44:12.000 --> 44:13.700
Sarge, we found Condor.

44:13.900 --> 44:15.300
What's his condition?

44:17.400 --> 44:18.400
He's screwed.

44:22.000 --> 44:23.500
Let's smoke this fucker.

44:41.800 --> 44:42.700
God!

44:43.800 --> 44:44.600
Sarge...

44:45.000 --> 44:46.100
Sven's dead.

44:46.800 --> 44:47.700
Jesus.!

44:48.300 --> 44:51.100
-You have got to get them out of there.
-They know what they're doing.

45:44.800 --> 45:45.900
Oh, man!

45:47.100 --> 45:48.500
Geko. Geko.

46:21.900 --> 46:22.800
I got him!

46:23.300 --> 46:24.500
I got him!

46:25.200 --> 46:27.100
Yes, yes.
See, they got him.

46:29.200 --> 46:30.800
Don't take your eyes
off him.

46:31.400 --> 46:32.600
I'm on my way.

46:32.800 --> 46:34.800
Take your time.
He ain't going nowhere.

46:50.200 --> 46:51.200
Briggs...

46:52.900 --> 46:54.300
get out of here.

46:55.600 --> 46:56.900
Kicker. Briggs.

46:57.100 --> 46:58.500
Where are you, damn it?

47:11.200 --> 47:12.700
He's all alone in there.

47:43.400 --> 47:46.500
It'll take more than a poke
in the ribs to put down this old dog.

47:48.700 --> 47:49.600
Yeah,

47:50.000 --> 47:51.200
that ought to do it.

48:02.800 --> 48:04.100
Such a waste.

48:07.600 --> 48:09.400
I told him to stay calm.

48:10.200 --> 48:13.100
To wait until we got to Solaris and
then we could take care of this...

48:14.000 --> 48:15.100
monster.

48:18.600 --> 48:21.100
I said,
"Don't go in unprepared."

48:24.300 --> 48:25.700
Brodski was just too proud.

48:36.500 --> 48:38.500
Who locked the damn door?

48:42.600 --> 48:45.100
Somebody wants to tell me
what is going on?

48:45.400 --> 48:46.700
Grunts are dead.

48:47.900 --> 48:49.400
-Which ones?
-All of them.

48:58.400 --> 48:59.500
Oh, man!

49:02.700 --> 49:04.800
Lou, how long
till we reach Solaris?

49:05.400 --> 49:07.500
I'm taking us out
of hyperdrive now.

49:10.900 --> 49:13.200
Kids and their goddamn
field trips, you know?

49:14.500 --> 49:16.100
Just bring a psycho on board.

49:16.400 --> 49:18.100
I know I'll get blamed
for this shit.

49:18.300 --> 49:21.700
Solaris to Grendel, we have you on
approach. Stand by for docking number.

49:21.900 --> 49:24.100
Grendel to Solaris, we need
military and medical at the gate.

49:24.400 --> 49:26.800
We got a big problem here.
Real goat fuck.

49:27.400 --> 49:29.000
Grendel, what's your problem?

49:30.400 --> 49:31.500
What's your problem?

49:39.200 --> 49:39.900
Look...

49:40.200 --> 49:41.300
we'll be all right.

49:41.700 --> 49:44.400
He's trapped in the cargo bay.
We're locked in here.

49:44.700 --> 49:46.600
Can the Solaris grunts
kill him?

49:46.800 --> 49:47.400
Absolutely.

49:49.200 --> 49:51.000
I've been in constant contact
with Solaris.

49:51.200 --> 49:53.300
Sixty highly
trained professionals

49:53.600 --> 49:55.400
are standing by to get us
off this ship.

49:55.600 --> 49:58.100
Solaris to Grendel, pull up.
Abort docking.

49:58.300 --> 50:00.200
You're coming in too fast.
Grendel...

50:01.100 --> 50:02.100
What now?

50:03.000 --> 50:04.900
-Warning. Prepare for impact.
-Hang on!

50:08.900 --> 50:10.000
What's going on?

50:17.300 --> 50:18.700
What the hell's going on?

50:49.200 --> 50:50.300
Everyone okay?

50:51.000 --> 50:51.800
What just happened?

50:52.000 --> 50:53.400
-Waylander.
-Yeah.

50:57.500 --> 50:59.800
We overshot it. We'll turn
around and go back.

51:02.100 --> 51:02.700
Hang on.

51:11.600 --> 51:12.700
Oh, my God!

51:14.100 --> 51:15.400
Solaris is gone.

51:16.000 --> 51:16.900
Gone?

51:17.800 --> 51:20.700
-It can't be gone.
-Look. It's gone.

51:22.300 --> 51:23.500
What are we going to do?

51:28.700 --> 51:29.300
Lou.

51:30.100 --> 51:31.500
What sort of damage
we looking at?

51:33.800 --> 51:35.500
I'm sending out
a distress beacon.

51:35.800 --> 51:36.700
-Lou?
-Guys...

51:37.000 --> 51:39.600
We've lost
our entire port pontoon.

51:39.800 --> 51:41.600
-The internal pressure is stable.
-The main...

51:41.800 --> 51:43.900
-thrusters are offline.
-Life support?

51:44.100 --> 51:45.200
We should be okay
for a while.

51:45.600 --> 51:48.300
-But he's out there.
-We'll be fine.

51:48.500 --> 51:51.400
We're in a high-volume traffic lane.
Another ship'll come by.

51:55.200 --> 51:56.200
We'll be safe here.

52:00.900 --> 52:01.500
Shut up!

52:18.900 --> 52:20.100
What are you doing?

52:42.200 --> 52:43.700
Maybe he gave up.

52:43.900 --> 52:45.500
You really think so?

52:58.100 --> 52:59.500
I don't think he's out there.

53:00.200 --> 53:03.200
Why don't you just stick your head
out and have a peek?

53:16.400 --> 53:18.400
Oh, my God! Go! Go!

53:20.100 --> 53:21.500
Janessa, go!

53:22.100 --> 53:23.900
Move it, move it, move it!
Come on!

53:24.600 --> 53:25.600
Let's go!

53:43.200 --> 53:44.900
Where's professor Lowe?

53:52.700 --> 53:53.600
Hi.

53:56.700 --> 53:57.300
Look...

53:58.200 --> 53:59.900
do you know
how valuable you are?

54:00.400 --> 54:01.700
I mean, fame, money.

54:02.000 --> 54:04.900
With my help, you're going
to have it all.

54:06.200 --> 54:08.700
I know people.
I have connections!

54:09.600 --> 54:11.400
Together we can make
a fortune.

54:12.000 --> 54:13.100
We can.

54:17.400 --> 54:18.300
Oh, shit!

54:20.800 --> 54:22.000
You want your machete back.

54:23.000 --> 54:25.200
Shit, it's yours, take it.

54:26.600 --> 54:28.900
Just remember
who saved it for you.

54:30.600 --> 54:33.700
Guys, it's okay! He just wanted
his machete back!

54:37.300 --> 54:38.900
I'm going to go back

54:39.100 --> 54:42.000
to my room because Stoney's
meeting me there.

54:47.300 --> 54:49.600
All right, look. How do
we get off this ship?

54:49.800 --> 54:50.800
I don't know.

54:51.300 --> 54:52.500
Could you beam us off
or something?

54:52.700 --> 54:53.600
"Beam us off?"

55:01.600 --> 55:02.500
The shuttle.

55:04.700 --> 55:06.400
The shuttle.
What about it, Crutch?

55:07.100 --> 55:09.600
Yeah, I can do prelaunch
from the bridge.

55:10.500 --> 55:12.400
Good. The rest of us'll head
to the shuttle.

55:12.600 --> 55:13.700
We'll start...

55:13.900 --> 55:14.900
I'm with you, Crutch.

55:25.200 --> 55:27.200
-You know how to use that thing?
-Yep.

55:27.400 --> 55:30.000
Like riding a bike. Once you learn,
you never forget.

55:30.200 --> 55:32.500
Kay-Em and I will go to the supply
hold. Meet you at the shuttle bay.

55:32.700 --> 55:35.100
-See you there.
-See there.

55:36.300 --> 55:37.800
What's a bike?

55:38.100 --> 55:39.900
We've enough fire power
to level a moon.

55:40.200 --> 55:42.300
Let's pack up and head
for the shuttle.

55:42.600 --> 55:44.200
So, you think we'll make it?

55:44.400 --> 55:47.400
The statistical probability
of survival is 12 percent.

55:47.800 --> 55:50.600
Twelve percent? Can't you come up
with better odds?

55:51.100 --> 55:54.000
-No.
-Bullshit, Kay-Em! That's bullshit!

55:55.300 --> 55:57.700
Preparation for launch
may be a simple procedure,

55:58.000 --> 55:59.500
but getting there alive?

56:00.000 --> 56:01.300
It is a problem.

56:01.600 --> 56:03.500
You telling me that there's
absolutely no chance

56:03.800 --> 56:05.500
for us to better
our odds?

56:13.000 --> 56:15.700
Statistical probability of survival
just went up to...

56:16.300 --> 56:17.900
fifty-three percent.

56:18.900 --> 56:20.300
Want to go for a hundred?

56:51.000 --> 56:52.100
He's here.

56:52.800 --> 56:53.800
Quiet.

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
But if he's in here,
he'll kill us...

56:57.200 --> 56:58.100
Quiet!

56:58.500 --> 57:01.300
One more sound, and I'll snap
your neck myself.

57:02.200 --> 57:03.100
Got it?

57:04.000 --> 57:05.300
She's good with people.

57:08.100 --> 57:09.100
Did you see that?

57:09.300 --> 57:11.500
-What?
-I think someone's alive over there.

57:14.400 --> 57:15.900
We don't have time for this.

57:21.600 --> 57:24.000
-Which way is the shuttle bay?
-Straight through.

57:25.200 --> 57:27.000
Go. I'll meet you there.

57:30.900 --> 57:32.900
Just...
don't wreck my pants.

58:04.300 --> 58:06.400
Come on, girl.
We're going home.

58:23.500 --> 58:24.700
Ah, Lou!

58:27.500 --> 58:29.000
Jesus, that's twisted.

58:33.300 --> 58:34.800
Course, I've seen worse.

58:38.200 --> 58:39.400
Okay, let's get to work.

58:56.400 --> 58:57.600
Brodski?

59:06.400 --> 59:07.500
Okay...

59:08.700 --> 59:10.100
We'll get you out of here.

59:11.400 --> 59:12.400
Oh, God!

59:14.600 --> 59:16.900
I'll go get help,
and I'll be back.

59:26.600 --> 59:27.900
Give me your vest.

59:32.100 --> 59:33.500
-Bastard.
-Hey...

59:34.900 --> 59:37.900
Lucky you weren't alive during
the Microsoft conflict.

59:38.200 --> 59:41.000
We were beating each other
with our own severed limbs.

59:41.200 --> 59:42.100
That's nice.

59:42.800 --> 59:43.800
Okay.

59:44.600 --> 59:45.900
Let's get us home.

59:46.800 --> 59:47.700
Kinsa, are you there?

59:48.000 --> 59:48.900
Yes, ma'am.

59:49.500 --> 59:50.300
Crutch?

59:50.800 --> 59:53.700
Prepare for fuel transfers.
Cells six and seven bypass.

59:53.900 --> 59:55.000
Hydraulic lifters.

59:57.500 --> 59:59.100
Pressurized and dampened.

01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:03.000
-It's Brodski, he's alive.
-No shit.

01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:05.200
I can't move him. Are Way
and Crutch back?

01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:07.400
-No, they're still on the bridge.
-I need help.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:08.600
Hey, guys.

01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:11.800
Brodski's still alive but Rowan
can't move him by herself.

01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:14.400
Go. I can handle it
from here.

01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:16.600
Tell them I'm on my way.
Watch your back.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.400
Crutch, how are we doing
for time?

01:00:21.100 --> 01:00:23.000
With a giant shitload
of good luck...

01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:24.900
...we might be

01:00:25.300 --> 01:00:26.300
ready to go.

01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:27.900
Good.

01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:32.700
Rowan.

01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:35.700
-Where's Brodski?
-He was here.

01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:36.800
I don't get it.

01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:40.500
And I am going home.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Lowe!

01:00:45.300 --> 01:00:46.100
Shit!

01:00:46.300 --> 01:00:47.100
I got company here,

01:00:47.300 --> 01:00:48.200
people!

01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:55.000
Let's go.

01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:05.700
Kinsa, open the door.
Open

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.100
the damn door!

01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:19.900
What's going on?
Why aren't you on board?

01:01:20.100 --> 01:01:22.900
Kinsa won't open the door.
She's lost it...

01:01:23.100 --> 01:01:25.000
and it's a really bad time
for this!

01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:26.700
Janessa, gently.
Give me the com.

01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:31.500
Kinsa, honey, it's Rowan.
I need you to open the door.

01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:33.500
No.

01:01:33.900 --> 01:01:36.200
It's all over, honey.
We can go home.

01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:38.500
All you need to do
is open the door.

01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:40.500
No.

01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:43.400
Oh, shit. Come on, guys.
Guys!

01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:45.800
Jesus Christ!
Open the goddamn door!

01:01:51.300 --> 01:01:53.400
No! The fuel lines
are still attached!

01:01:58.900 --> 01:01:59.600
Kinsa!

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.100
Now what?

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:22.800
I...

01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:25.600
Now, basically,

01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:26.900
we die.

01:02:27.100 --> 01:02:28.300
Bullshit!

01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:31.600
Okay, new plan.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.700
You hold him and I'll run.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:42.500
Hey, slappy!

01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:45.200
Got a little something
for you.

01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:54.600
Oh, wow!

01:02:54.900 --> 01:02:56.000
Gave her an upload.

01:02:57.100 --> 01:02:58.700
Afraid I'll have
to hurt you now.

01:03:02.700 --> 01:03:03.300
Kay-Em!

01:03:12.100 --> 01:03:13.100
That...

01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:15.100
That didn't go so well.

01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:21.700
Got you!

01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:28.500
Yeah.

01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:35.000
Hey!

01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:21.800
Giddy up!

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
I had it under control,
but thanks.

01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:38.200
My pleasure.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:25.800
Yeah.

01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:45.700
-You did it.
-Kay-Em.

01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:47.300
Who's your mama?

01:05:48.700 --> 01:05:49.800
All right.

01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:52.200
How you doing there, Brodski?

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.100
-I'm all right.
-Come on, let's get you patched up.

01:05:55.800 --> 01:05:57.000
What a mess.

01:05:57.800 --> 01:05:59.100
Lab two.

01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:09.000
Tsunaron,
is he gonna make it?

01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:12.500
Absolutely. He's
at 80 percent already.

01:06:12.900 --> 01:06:14.300
This guy is strong.

01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:20.500
What the hell?

01:06:25.100 --> 01:06:25.700
Way?

01:06:27.900 --> 01:06:30.500
Trouble. The collision
has compromised the hull.

01:06:30.700 --> 01:06:31.800
She's bleeding out.

01:06:33.300 --> 01:06:35.300
Oh, no. No, no,

01:06:35.500 --> 01:06:36.400
no.

01:06:37.300 --> 01:06:39.500
-Tiamat to Grendel, do you read?
Over.

01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:41.300
-Tiamat to Grendel, do you read?

01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:42.300
-Yes!

01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:45.100
Tiamat, this is Grendel,
we read you. Can you hear us?

01:06:45.300 --> 01:06:46.100
That's affirmative.

01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:48.000
We are reading
your distress beacon.

01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:51.200
-Are you in need of assistance?
-That's very affirmative, Tiamat.

01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:53.500
How soon can you get here?
Our situation

01:06:53.700 --> 01:06:55.200
is extremely critical.

01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:57.300
We're four parsecs away,
Grendel.

01:06:57.500 --> 01:06:59.900
ETA, 45 minutes.

01:07:01.300 --> 01:07:02.700
We don't have that much time.

01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:04.500
Tiamat, this is Grendel.

01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:07.900
We'll have a core implosion
in less than 30 minutes.

01:07:08.100 --> 01:07:09.100
Do you copy?

01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:11.600
We copy you, Grendel?

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
Advise how you'd like us
to proceed.

01:07:14.300 --> 01:07:15.900
We'll take them down
with us.

01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:22.200
Tiamat...

01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:26.200
if you can't get here in 30 minutes,
there's no point.

01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:28.700
What?! Are you high?! Tiamat,
this is Grendel.

01:07:28.900 --> 01:07:30.500
You just ignore that last idiot.

01:07:30.700 --> 01:07:33.100
You get your ass out here,
okay?

01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:35.000
You come here
and you save us.

01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:37.600
Why can't we just go
over here?

01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:41.300
It's no good. The pontoon goes,
it'll take the bridge with it.

01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:43.900
Not if we disconnect
these walkways.

01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:45.300
You can't just disconnect them.

01:07:46.100 --> 01:07:47.100
We could blow it up.

01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:49.200
There's macrocharge
in the weapons

01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:50.600
This could work.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.800
We're going
to try something.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.700
If you're game, maintain your current
course and speed...

01:07:57.200 --> 01:07:59.100
and hopefully we'll see you
when you get here.

01:07:59.300 --> 01:08:00.900
Copy.
See you in 45 minutes.

01:08:01.100 --> 01:08:02.400
-Good luck, Grendel.
-Thanks.

01:08:02.600 --> 01:08:03.900
Let's blow the walkways.

01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:05.300
Come on.

01:09:04.700 --> 01:09:07.100
Let's set the charges.
Who's got the remote?

01:09:07.300 --> 01:09:09.300
-Right here.
-We'll meet up in walkway "B."

01:09:44.100 --> 01:09:44.700
Go.

01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:21.400
-All set.
-Good to go.

01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:24.000
Hold together, baby.

01:10:39.500 --> 01:10:40.500
Impossible.

01:10:40.700 --> 01:10:43.300
-He's dead.
-I'd say he got better.

01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:45.700
-He's been modified.
-Oh, you think?

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:51.100
Can you take him?

01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:52.900
I can try.

01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:12.600
You guys might want to run.

01:11:15.100 --> 01:11:15.900
Kay-Em!

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:20.500
No!

01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:25.000
Waylander!

01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:28.000
Brodski, get in here, now!

01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:29.300
Come on, guys!

01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:30.900
Come on!

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.100
What the hell is going on?

01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:43.300
Jason Voorhees
is what's going on.

01:11:45.700 --> 01:11:48.100
-Blow the charges!
-Waylander's got the trigger!

01:11:50.100 --> 01:11:50.800
Hey...

01:11:51.700 --> 01:11:52.800
Asshole.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:30.300
I think she's holding.

01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:36.200
I think we're finally okay.

01:12:39.300 --> 01:12:40.700
I'd clap if I could.

01:12:44.500 --> 01:12:45.600
Tiamat to Grendel...

01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:46.900
Come in, Grendel.

01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:50.000
We have you vectored for approach
and emergency docking.

01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:54.000
You ready
to get off that boat?

01:12:55.300 --> 01:12:56.200
Yeah.

01:12:56.500 --> 01:12:57.600
Let's go home.

01:13:03.700 --> 01:13:07.000
Holy shit!
We got to go! Now!

01:13:07.500 --> 01:13:08.100
No!

01:13:22.500 --> 01:13:23.300
Janessa!

01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:40.300
Janessa!

01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:41.300
Don't let go!

01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:47.500
Grab her hand!

01:13:48.500 --> 01:13:49.300
Janessa!

01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:50.500
Reach out!

01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:54.400
Reach for it!

01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:00.400
Come on!

01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:03.600
Come on!

01:14:12.300 --> 01:14:15.200
Oh, this sucks on
so many levels!

01:14:16.900 --> 01:14:18.000
Janessa!

01:14:21.300 --> 01:14:22.200
Come on!

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:24.200
Come on! Come on!

01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:39.500
Janessa!

01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:47.200
Shit, he's still coming!

01:14:47.700 --> 01:14:48.700
-Oh, shit!
-Come on.

01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:53.300
Go!

01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:56.600
-Which way?
-This way! This way!

01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:19.400
Tiamat, we're
at the evac door.

01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:20.700
So am I, Grendel.

01:15:25.100 --> 01:15:26.400
Lifeline secured.

01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:28.500
Initiate collar
pressurization.

01:15:30.700 --> 01:15:32.100
Tiamat, open the outer doors.

01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:34.300
Damn!

01:15:34.500 --> 01:15:37.300
-What now?
-Let's get that bolt open.

01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:39.700
I've got this.
Let me try an override.

01:15:41.300 --> 01:15:43.300
Shit! Oh, shit!

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:45.100
Come on, come on.

01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:48.100
Our exterior motor's got
no power.

01:15:48.300 --> 01:15:50.700
-What does that mean?
-Means I'm going EVA.

01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:54.700
-What's EVA?
-It's a space walk.

01:15:54.900 --> 01:15:57.200
If he can jump the lines,
we can reroute them.

01:15:57.400 --> 01:16:00.200
Hopefully, that door'll open
before this blows up.

01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:02.200
-Sounds like a good plan.
-Tiamat, this is Grendel.

01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:04.500
Our escape hatch is jammed. We're
going EVA to try to patch it up.

01:16:04.900 --> 01:16:06.100
You'd better get a move on.

01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:15.300
I'm in the maintenance hatch.

01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:16.500
We read you.

01:16:17.100 --> 01:16:18.400
Opening outer doors.

01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:32.700
Those hatches won't keep him
that much longer.

01:16:32.900 --> 01:16:34.400
We need to buy more time.

01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:38.500
You're the expert on him,
right?

01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:41.200
-What are you thinking?
-A diversion.

01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:01.200
I'm at the control panels.

01:17:05.900 --> 01:17:06.800
Rowan, are you there?

01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:08.500
Yes.

01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:11.300
I'll divert the main power supply
and send it to you.

01:17:11.500 --> 01:17:12.400
Gotcha.

01:17:13.700 --> 01:17:15.100
See the bright blue diode?

01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:16.700
Connect it to the terminal.

01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:21.200
Was that you or me?

01:17:31.700 --> 01:17:33.800
That was another part
of your hull, Grendel.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:35.100
You are running out of time.

01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:36.900
Just a few more minutes.

01:17:37.100 --> 01:17:38.900
We can disengage and come
around again.

01:17:39.100 --> 01:17:40.500
Negative.
Just another minute.

01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:44.500
We'll stand by
as long as we can.

01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:02.700
-You ready, Kay?
-I was built ready, baby.

01:18:02.900 --> 01:18:03.700
Initiate.

01:18:51.100 --> 01:18:52.800
It's working.
He's buying it.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:03.500
-Whoops.
-What do you mean, "Whoops"?

01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:05.300
Nothing.

01:19:06.300 --> 01:19:08.200
Not nothing.
You don't just say "oops."

01:19:08.900 --> 01:19:10.200
I think he saw me.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:11.900
Oh, man!

01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:14.500
If you've got something brilliant,
now’s the time to do it.

01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:15.400
I got something.

01:19:15.900 --> 01:19:17.100
I got something.

01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:20.300
Prepare variations using data file
Crystal Lake, 1980.

01:19:22.100 --> 01:19:22.700
Kay?

01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:24.400
Here goes nothing.

01:19:24.700 --> 01:19:25.500
Initiate.

01:19:30.700 --> 01:19:33.600
-You want a beer?
-Or want to smoke some pot?

01:19:34.300 --> 01:19:36.100
Or we can have premarital sex.

01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:40.300
We love premarital sex.

01:19:55.600 --> 01:19:56.300
Try it now, Rowan.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:57.900
Here we go.

01:20:01.300 --> 01:20:02.500
You piece of crap!

01:20:15.400 --> 01:20:16.600
He's done with the campers.

01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:17.900
He's good!

01:20:18.100 --> 01:20:19.100
Too good.
He's coming back.

01:20:21.300 --> 01:20:22.100
Try it again.

01:20:22.700 --> 01:20:24.400
It's engaged!
The door's engaged!

01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:28.000
Brodski, you are the man!

01:20:31.100 --> 01:20:32.600
Will we see you sometime
soon?

01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:33.800
I'm on my way.

01:20:48.200 --> 01:20:49.500
Brodski, where are you?!

01:21:01.100 --> 01:21:03.100
Grendel, we can't keep
pressure lock.

01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:05.200
We'll disengage in forty seconds.

01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:07.100
Kay-Em.

01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:39.900
Ten, nine, eight,

01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:41.500
seven, six,

01:21:41.700 --> 01:21:43.100
five, four,

01:21:43.400 --> 01:21:45.100
three, two, one.

01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:46.700
-Clear!
-No!

01:21:47.200 --> 01:21:48.200
No, wait!

01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:49.300
Disconnect.

01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:11.100
He's coming this way.

01:22:14.900 --> 01:22:16.100
You've got to be kidding me.

01:22:17.900 --> 01:22:18.800
Brodski!

01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:31.100
He's gone.

01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:34.900
I can't believe it.

01:22:35.700 --> 01:22:36.600
Tsun?

01:22:37.300 --> 01:22:39.100
Kay-Em. Are you okay?

01:22:40.200 --> 01:22:43.100
I'll be back on my feet.
As soon as I have some.

01:22:43.300 --> 01:22:44.500
I'll get right on it.

01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:48.500
It's beautiful.

01:23:09.900 --> 01:23:11.900
-Look at that.
-A shooting star.

01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:22.700
Make a wish.

01:23:29.500 --> 01:23:30.900
It landed in the lake.

01:23:34.300 --> 01:23:35.500
Let's go check it out.
