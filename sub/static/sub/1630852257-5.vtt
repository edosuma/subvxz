00:51.343 --> 00:53.136
- Hello, bakers.

00:53.178 --> 00:55.055
'Tis the night before finals.

00:55.096 --> 00:58.308
- And all through the cabin
are the semifinalists.

00:58.350 --> 01:01.603
And in case you don't
get poetry, that's you.

01:01.644 --> 01:05.899
- After today, only three teams
will continue on to the finals.

01:05.940 --> 01:07.525
- And from there, only one team

01:07.567 --> 01:09.444
will be named
the Master-Bakers.

01:09.486 --> 01:11.279
- No, absolutely not.
- Hmm?

01:11.321 --> 01:12.864
- We're not calling it that.
- I am.

01:14.324 --> 01:16.284
Holidays are all
about the precious moments

01:16.326 --> 01:17.952
you share
with family and friends.

01:17.994 --> 01:19.496
But it's hard to find the time

01:19.537 --> 01:21.706
if you're always baking
by the books.

01:22.665 --> 01:24.959
- In our
Short and Sweet Challenge,

01:25.001 --> 01:27.379
today we want to see some
of the kitchen hacks you use

01:27.420 --> 01:29.547
to make more time
for fun and games.

01:29.589 --> 01:32.258
- We're playing White Elephant.

01:32.300 --> 01:34.636
Everyone's favorite holiday
stealing game.

01:34.678 --> 01:36.054
- Oh, my God.

01:36.096 --> 01:37.639
- After you pick your box,

01:37.681 --> 01:39.641
we will call you
in random order to open it

01:39.683 --> 01:41.518
and reveal
the mystery ingredient.

01:41.559 --> 01:42.644
- Ooh.

01:42.686 --> 01:45.188
But our White Elephant
has two twists.

01:45.230 --> 01:46.731
- The first twist is that

01:46.773 --> 01:48.817
you'll have to think
outside the box

01:48.858 --> 01:51.403
and reinvent whatever
ingredient you find inside.

01:51.444 --> 01:53.488
- So if you get cake mix,

01:53.530 --> 01:55.824
you'll have to make something
other than cake.

01:55.865 --> 01:58.410
- The White Elephant's
second twist

01:58.451 --> 02:00.328
is that the last team we call

02:00.370 --> 02:02.997
and only the last team
has a choice to make.

02:03.039 --> 02:05.583
- They can keep their
unopened box or they can force

02:05.625 --> 02:07.502
any other team
to swap with them

02:07.544 --> 02:09.629
since their ingredients
have already been revealed.

02:09.671 --> 02:11.172
- So let's get
the White Elephant started

02:11.214 --> 02:12.257
with a stampede.

02:12.298 --> 02:14.843
Bakers, get your ingredients.

02:17.637 --> 02:19.764
- That's what I call
a stampede.

02:19.806 --> 02:21.850
- Get us the green.

02:21.891 --> 02:23.184
- Oh!
- Stripey.

02:23.226 --> 02:25.311
- Honey!
- Okay.

02:25.353 --> 02:27.397
- Okay. Here we go.

02:27.439 --> 02:29.816
- Niyati and Abhi,
open your box.

02:30.859 --> 02:32.902
- Okay.

02:32.944 --> 02:34.320
We have the cinnamon rolls.

02:34.362 --> 02:36.239
- Jessica and Stephanie.

02:36.281 --> 02:39.284
- Oh!
- Pudding.

02:39.325 --> 02:40.410
- Pudding mix.

02:42.203 --> 02:44.831
Pudding mix.
I hate pudding.

02:44.873 --> 02:47.292
You can't even believe
how much we love pudding mix.

02:47.334 --> 02:48.918
- How much do you love
the pudding?

02:48.960 --> 02:50.170
- Love it!
- So much!

02:50.211 --> 02:52.589
- Steve and Tom.

02:52.630 --> 02:56.634
- Pancake mix.

02:56.676 --> 02:58.762
- So we are in the sweet spot
for this challenge.

02:58.803 --> 03:02.140
We get to go last, which means
we have the ability to take

03:02.182 --> 03:05.060
anybody else's ingredient
that we want, which is great.

03:05.101 --> 03:07.562
- Jonah and Patrick,
before you open the gift.

03:07.604 --> 03:11.775
Are you going to keep it
or steal from someone else?

03:11.816 --> 03:13.026
- Ooh.

03:14.861 --> 03:16.780
- Um...

03:16.821 --> 03:20.408
- I'm just hoping they will
take our stupid pudding.

03:20.450 --> 03:23.787
- We want to swap.
- Ooh.

03:24.996 --> 03:26.331
- With whom?

03:28.625 --> 03:31.586
- Sorry, we love you,
but Niyati and Abhi.

03:31.628 --> 03:34.381
- Oh, God!
<i>- * Dun, dun, dun! ♪</i>

03:34.422 --> 03:36.257
- Sorry!
- No worries.

03:36.299 --> 03:38.176
- It's fine.
- Don't blame me.

03:38.218 --> 03:40.011
Blame the White Elephant, baby.

03:40.053 --> 03:42.972
- The While Elephant moves
in mysterious ways.

03:43.014 --> 03:44.766
- Like this.

03:48.269 --> 03:49.813
- Oh.
- We have biscuits.

03:49.854 --> 03:51.856
- Biscuits...

03:51.898 --> 03:53.942
<i>- I have not made
biscuits before.</i>

03:53.983 --> 03:56.611
- It might take some more time
to think about

03:56.653 --> 03:58.113
how to use it in a quick hack.

03:58.154 --> 04:00.699
So it's--it's really
getting nervous here.

04:00.740 --> 04:03.702
- Now, bakers,
you have 45 minutes

04:03.743 --> 04:05.829
to make the most of your hacks.

04:05.870 --> 04:08.039
- So...

04:08.081 --> 04:10.333
let's get bakin'!

04:10.375 --> 04:13.545
- I got the exact one
I didn't want.

04:13.586 --> 04:14.796
- I know, dude.

04:14.838 --> 04:15.880
- Um, you know
what we could make?

04:15.922 --> 04:16.965
A king cake.

04:17.007 --> 04:18.758
- Let's do chicken
and dumplings.

04:18.800 --> 04:20.051
You go ahead and get
the chicken rolling

04:20.093 --> 04:21.177
and make the gravy.

04:21.219 --> 04:22.470
- You're using
the vanilla pudding mix

04:22.512 --> 04:23.763
to make the cookies.

04:23.805 --> 04:24.889
And then I'll use
this chocolate pudding mix

04:24.931 --> 04:26.933
to make some ice cream.
- Okay.

04:26.975 --> 04:28.768
I am worried
about time for this.

04:28.810 --> 04:30.145
It's 45 minutes.

04:30.186 --> 04:31.980
<i>But of all the ingredients,
the cinnamon rolls</i>

04:32.022 --> 04:33.815
<i>are the ones that are
almost already done.</i>

04:33.857 --> 04:35.650
I think that's the quickest
hack that we could do.

04:35.692 --> 04:37.318
- I'll go get my sugars.

04:38.361 --> 04:40.238
- It always seems like
the bakers have plenty of time,

04:40.280 --> 04:41.656
so with the Short and Sweet,

04:41.698 --> 04:44.117
we're actually making
their time shorter.

04:44.159 --> 04:45.452
And sweeter.

04:45.493 --> 04:46.786
- Do you think they're
finding it sweeter?

04:46.828 --> 04:47.912
- No.

04:47.954 --> 04:49.706
- Just a good name?
- Yeah.

04:50.790 --> 04:53.001
- Go, go, go.
- I need pudding.

04:53.043 --> 04:54.502
We're really nervous
about time.

04:54.544 --> 04:56.254
It's a 45-minute challenge.

04:56.296 --> 04:57.714
- And time has not
been our friend.

04:57.756 --> 04:59.674
Use half of it.
- Okay.

04:59.716 --> 05:03.178
- I am not really
a shortcut taker.

05:03.219 --> 05:04.763
I'm more of a...

05:04.804 --> 05:06.848
"Is there a way that I can make
something more complicated

05:06.890 --> 05:09.517
<i>and take longer
and use more ingredients?"</i>

05:09.559 --> 05:11.186
We have time to make
some hot fudge.

05:11.227 --> 05:12.729
- Yeah. And I'm gonna
make these into little cups,

05:12.771 --> 05:14.189
so it's gonna hold
the ice cream.

05:15.774 --> 05:18.193
- I need to find a way
to open it up first.

05:18.234 --> 05:20.612
And we just get 45 minutes
for this challenge,

05:20.653 --> 05:23.615
<i>and we have to whip
something up last minute</i>

05:23.656 --> 05:25.408
<i>out of a quick hack.</i>

05:25.450 --> 05:28.703
But we have never used biscuits
in a quick hack before.

05:31.915 --> 05:33.708
- You okay, Abhi?

05:33.750 --> 05:35.585
- We're not able to open it.

05:41.424 --> 05:43.677
- Okay.
- I can't open this one.

05:43.718 --> 05:46.429
- Would you steal?
- If I was doing this game...

05:46.471 --> 05:48.098
- Mm-hmm.
- I would steal.

05:48.139 --> 05:51.559
But then when they ask me to
give them my first ingredient,

05:51.601 --> 05:53.144
I'd be like, "I don't have it."

05:53.186 --> 05:54.562
- That's smart.
- "What are you talking about?"

05:54.604 --> 05:55.730
- That's smart.

05:55.772 --> 05:57.023
- And then they'd be like,
"What?"

05:57.065 --> 05:59.025
- Happy holidays!
- We love you!

06:01.528 --> 06:03.154
- Oh, good.

06:06.324 --> 06:07.784
- What's the marzipan for?

06:07.826 --> 06:10.495
- I think I might make
a little baby.

06:10.537 --> 06:13.581
- You're gonna make
a marzipan Baby Jesus?

06:17.961 --> 06:19.254
- Hey, Jonah, Patrick,
what's going on?

06:19.295 --> 06:20.255
- Maya and Andy. Mandy.

06:20.296 --> 06:22.090
- Mandy?
- Sure.

06:22.132 --> 06:24.092
- People call us Patronah.
Actually, they don't.

06:24.134 --> 06:25.260
No one calls us that.
- He just did.

06:25.301 --> 06:26.261
- Well, they do now.
- Oh, no!

06:26.302 --> 06:27.303
- They do now, Patronah.

06:27.345 --> 06:28.471
- So, Patronah...
- Yeah.

06:28.513 --> 06:30.098
- Tell us what you're making.
- Ahh!

06:30.140 --> 06:31.266
- See now, you've got
just some sprinkles.

06:31.307 --> 06:32.642
- Sprinkles went flying.

06:32.684 --> 06:33.476
You really do have
a signature edible glitter.

06:33.518 --> 06:35.103
- We do.

06:35.145 --> 06:36.146
- I mean, it's gotten
us this far.

06:36.187 --> 06:37.230
- Yeah.

06:37.272 --> 06:39.024
- And we are unencumbered
by victory.

06:39.065 --> 06:40.775
We don't have any brooches
to brag about.

06:40.817 --> 06:43.111
This is not the time
to strike out.

06:43.153 --> 06:46.614
It's the semifinals.
We have zero brooches.

06:46.656 --> 06:47.907
- We're running out of glitter.
- Yeah.

06:47.949 --> 06:50.118
We cannot leave
this competition

06:50.160 --> 06:53.621
without getting a smile
from Nana Harriet.

06:53.663 --> 06:55.165
- I'd--I'd settle for a hug.

06:55.206 --> 06:57.083
Not a hug goodbye. Not yet.
- Yeah.

06:57.125 --> 06:58.418
So, Patrick,
tell them about this

06:58.460 --> 06:59.961
because this is
from your family.

07:00.003 --> 07:02.797
- Okay. So this is
nontraditional king cake,

07:02.839 --> 07:05.133
<i>a wonderful dish
served at Mardi Gras.</i>

07:05.175 --> 07:07.344
And Mardi Gras starts
at the--after the Epiphany.

07:07.385 --> 07:09.304
- I know a couple grannies
that are gonna be into that.

07:09.346 --> 07:12.057
- I could not be left alone
with this cake

07:12.098 --> 07:13.475
because I know what I do

07:13.516 --> 07:15.894
with king cakes at home
during Mardi Gras carnival.

07:15.935 --> 07:17.354
- No.
- We don't.

07:18.938 --> 07:20.065
- The thing about king cake

07:20.106 --> 07:21.483
is the tradition
is you typically--

07:21.524 --> 07:22.984
- Oh, shoot, his head fell off.

07:23.026 --> 07:25.070
- Are you hurting my babies?
- His head fell off.

07:25.111 --> 07:27.072
- This is why we don't--this
is why we don't have children.

07:27.113 --> 07:28.365
- Those really look like
little babies.

07:28.406 --> 07:29.699
- They're babies!
- They are.

07:29.741 --> 07:31.659
And they don't look cute,
but you can say they are.

07:31.701 --> 07:32.660
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

07:32.702 --> 07:34.079
- You know, like most babies.

07:34.120 --> 07:35.372
- Are you gonna put that
secret baby in your king cake?

07:35.413 --> 07:36.331
- That should have
been our reveal.

07:36.373 --> 07:37.540
- It's gonna be on the side.

07:37.582 --> 07:39.834
- We are putting baby
in the corner.

07:39.876 --> 07:41.753
- Come on.
That deserved a high-five.

07:41.795 --> 07:44.464
- It was very bold
of Jonah and Patrick

07:44.506 --> 07:48.009
to make a king cake
for the two N'awlins grannies.

07:48.051 --> 07:49.844
You know what they say,
if you come at the queens

07:49.886 --> 07:52.222
with a king cake,
you better not miss.

07:53.014 --> 07:55.183
- I think it softens up
cookies nicely.

07:55.225 --> 07:56.851
- I want to put some parsley
in those dumplings.

07:56.893 --> 07:59.854
- Okay.
- Mad scientists over here.

07:59.896 --> 08:01.022
- I'll get the jam.
You've got that jam?

08:01.064 --> 08:02.273
- Yeah, yeah.

08:02.315 --> 08:03.274
- Just them in.
- These are ready to go in.

08:03.316 --> 08:04.192
- Are they done?

08:04.234 --> 08:05.193
- Yeah.

08:08.238 --> 08:09.280
- Jessica and Stephanie, hi.
- Hey!

08:09.322 --> 08:10.490
- Hi.
- What you doing?

08:10.532 --> 08:11.866
What are you making?
- Pudding three ways.

08:11.908 --> 08:13.743
- Yeah? I did a lot
of those in college.

08:13.785 --> 08:16.663
Pudding three ways?
- Yeah.

08:16.705 --> 08:20.417
- And yeah, so we are doing
a chocolate pudding ice cream

08:20.458 --> 08:22.544
<i>in a vanilla pudding
chocolate chip cookie cup</i>

08:22.585 --> 08:24.087
<i>and with spiced hot fudge.</i>

08:24.129 --> 08:25.380
<i>- This is a super short
challenge, and you were like,</i>

08:25.422 --> 08:26.673
<i>"Let's do it three ways."</i>

08:26.715 --> 08:27.716
- Because if pudding
is disgusting one time...

08:27.757 --> 08:29.300
- Right.
- Why not do it three times?

08:29.342 --> 08:30.427
- That's what I like to hear.
- You're really hyping it up.

08:30.468 --> 08:32.178
- I don't like pudding.

08:32.220 --> 08:33.805
It's like my least
favorite thing on the planet.

08:33.847 --> 08:35.306
Have I mentioned
that I hate pudding?

08:35.348 --> 08:38.476
'Cause I hate pudding.
I have issues with the texture.

08:38.518 --> 08:40.228
<i>I have issues with the flavor.</i>

08:40.270 --> 08:45.442
And I'm just hoping that we'll
communicate to the grannies

08:45.483 --> 08:46.901
that we know what we're doing,

08:46.943 --> 08:48.945
and that we were able
to take an ingredient

08:48.987 --> 08:51.573
and transform it
into something delicious.

08:51.614 --> 08:54.284
We love pudding!
- There we go.

08:54.325 --> 08:55.827
- When you make your stock,

08:55.869 --> 08:58.580
I'll go ahead and get rolling
on dropping those dumplings.

08:58.621 --> 08:59.831
- We're gonna put
the chicken in last.

08:59.873 --> 09:03.084
- Do you want it to be
that inconsistent?

09:03.126 --> 09:05.628
- I just like it torn.
It looks old fashioned.

09:05.670 --> 09:07.714
- It does.
- And that's how I want it

09:07.756 --> 09:09.049
to look, like my
grandmothers made.

09:09.090 --> 09:10.675
- Hi!
Tom and Steve!

09:10.717 --> 09:12.427
- Happy to see you.
- Hi, hi, hi.

09:12.469 --> 09:13.928
- Hey, happy to see you guys.
What's happening over here?

09:13.970 --> 09:15.597
- A 45-minute chicken
and dumplings

09:15.638 --> 09:16.598
<i>out of pancake mix.</i>

09:16.639 --> 09:18.224
<i>One of my very favorite meals.</i>

09:18.266 --> 09:21.019
<i>This recipe was inspired
by Nana Montel.</i>

09:21.061 --> 09:22.771
<i>Her chicken and dumplings
were like heaven</i>

09:22.812 --> 09:24.439
<i>on this good Earth.</i>

09:24.481 --> 09:27.359
<i>So I'm sauteing the chicken
in butter and chicken stock.</i>

09:27.400 --> 09:29.486
<i>- And we made dumplings
out of the pancake mix.</i>

09:29.527 --> 09:31.863
Instead of putting it
into a pan, we're gonna drop it

09:31.905 --> 09:33.948
into a pot of boiling water.

09:33.990 --> 09:36.034
And we're just gonna
let these things blow up.

09:36.076 --> 09:37.994
- We're not used to using
pancake mix out of a box.

09:38.036 --> 09:40.080
- Anything boxed.
It's gonna be a little bit

09:40.121 --> 09:41.247
of a challenge
to try to transform it.

09:41.289 --> 09:42.707
- Yeah.
- So you got pancake mix.

09:42.749 --> 09:43.667
You're making chicken
and dumplings.

09:43.708 --> 09:45.085
- Yeah.
- Yes.

09:45.126 --> 09:46.503
- You put the dumplings
into the chicken.

09:46.544 --> 09:47.796
- Yeah.
- You boil the chick.

09:47.837 --> 09:48.963
You put the dump--

09:49.005 --> 09:50.215
- Well, the chick's
just for flavor.

09:50.256 --> 09:51.299
- We dump the chicks.
- We used all we have

09:51.341 --> 09:52.467
- Oh, you dump the chicks?
- Yeah.

09:52.509 --> 09:53.802
- We dump the chicks.

09:53.843 --> 09:56.388
- I wonder if anyone is gonna
actually cook

09:56.429 --> 09:57.931
with white elephant meat.

09:57.972 --> 10:01.267
- What do you think it's like?
Chewy or--or soft?

10:01.309 --> 10:02.936
- Tough.
- Yeah.

10:02.977 --> 10:05.605
- Like you could just
make marble columns with it.

10:05.647 --> 10:08.233
- Steaks.
You make white elephant chops.

10:09.859 --> 10:13.029
White elephant "chops"?
- You make "chops."

10:13.071 --> 10:15.865
Make a filet, a T-bone.

10:15.907 --> 10:17.826
- What is that accent?
- I'm not sure.

10:25.291 --> 10:27.335
- Today, we are doing
a White Elephant bake.

10:27.377 --> 10:29.879
So all the bakers got
a surprise ingredient

10:29.921 --> 10:32.424
inside of a box--

10:32.465 --> 10:34.884
- What's in the box?
Is it Gwyneth's head?

10:34.926 --> 10:37.303
- It's Gwyneth's head!
- Oh, no, Gwyneth!

10:37.345 --> 10:40.765
- It's not a in a box!
- Thank you.

10:43.226 --> 10:45.437
- How many should I make more?

10:45.478 --> 10:46.896
- Just--we'll see
which are the good ones

10:46.938 --> 10:48.398
and we'll take the good ones.
- Okay.

10:48.440 --> 10:49.941
- Two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

10:49.983 --> 10:51.234
- So we're at 15.

10:51.276 --> 10:53.153
So we have enough
to do two each.

10:53.194 --> 10:56.114
- I have to cool this thing
down before I can ice it.

10:56.156 --> 10:57.449
Otherwise it's just
gonna be a puddle.

10:57.490 --> 10:59.200
- Hey, can you fan
a little bit higher?

10:59.242 --> 11:01.119
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

11:01.161 --> 11:02.954
- It's a little quiet
in here, no?

11:02.996 --> 11:05.165
- Only four teams left.

11:05.206 --> 11:07.292
- I'll check for doneness.

11:07.334 --> 11:10.128
<i>- So we decided to make
fried donut holes.</i>

11:10.170 --> 11:12.547
And I want them
really cooked from inside.

11:12.589 --> 11:14.507
I don't want to
give them half fried.

11:14.549 --> 11:16.009
- Mm-hmm.

11:16.051 --> 11:18.011
- So I'm keeping them in
the fryer a little bit longer.

11:18.053 --> 11:19.929
<i>It is making me
a little bit nervous,</i>

11:19.971 --> 11:22.766
but I think
I'll go with my gut.

11:22.807 --> 11:24.434
I'm gonna fry them again.

11:26.019 --> 11:27.395
Niyati and Abhi!
- Hello.

11:27.437 --> 11:28.897
- How are you, my friends?
- Good.

11:28.938 --> 11:30.148
- So we're walking and talking
really fast

11:30.190 --> 11:31.232
'cause this is--
this is a short challenge.

11:31.274 --> 11:32.317
- It is.
- It's a very short challenge.

11:32.359 --> 11:33.360
- 45 minutes
and you're right there.

11:33.401 --> 11:35.153
- You got swapped.
- Yeah.

11:35.195 --> 11:36.363
- They swapped you.
- You got swapped.

11:36.404 --> 11:38.156
- They stole our, you know,
our mojo

11:38.198 --> 11:39.574
and also our ingredient.

11:39.616 --> 11:42.202
But hey, when life
gives you biscuits,

11:42.243 --> 11:43.745
you make donut holes
out of them.

11:43.787 --> 11:45.413
<i>- Ooh!
- Oh, girl.</i>

11:45.455 --> 11:48.333
<i>You're talking my language.
- PS, a T-shirt I would wear.</i>

11:49.542 --> 11:51.086
- Are you making holes in them?

11:51.127 --> 11:52.128
- Yeah.
Because we're gonna be, like...

11:52.170 --> 11:53.171
- Filling it with--

11:53.213 --> 11:54.714
- Injecting them
with a preserve,

11:54.756 --> 11:59.052
which we made out of apricots,
raspberry, toasted fennel...

11:59.094 --> 12:00.512
- Oh.
- And some toasted coconut.

12:00.553 --> 12:01.554
- Yeah.

12:01.596 --> 12:02.931
- And then we'll be
glazing this off

12:02.972 --> 12:04.557
with some sticky toffee.
Yeah.

12:04.599 --> 12:06.685
- Let me tell you something.
They can never steal your mojo.

12:06.726 --> 12:07.769
Just remember that.

12:07.811 --> 12:09.270
Keep it inside.
- Still there.

12:09.312 --> 12:11.022
- Yeah.
- You just need to dig deeper.

12:11.064 --> 12:13.858
- It's just a burning ember
that needs to be--

12:13.900 --> 12:15.443
- Yeah.

12:15.485 --> 12:17.028
Usually we have a lot of time
to visit everyone's stations.

12:17.070 --> 12:18.363
- Yeah.
- And go around.

12:18.405 --> 12:21.074
Ask them questions.
And today, we had zero time.

12:21.116 --> 12:22.909
- Yeah, there were
a few factors there.

12:22.951 --> 12:24.452
One, it was a superfast bake.
- Mm-hmm.

12:24.494 --> 12:28.206
- Two, I just pugged like a
gallon of coffee right before.

12:28.248 --> 12:29.791
- Yeah, you were
z-z-zinging it.

12:29.833 --> 12:32.252
- I'm not sure we even needed
to go that fast, looking back.

12:34.170 --> 12:36.297
- Five minutes left.
Oh, no!

12:36.339 --> 12:40.719
- Can you hack it?
- No, we can't!

12:40.760 --> 12:43.346
- Should I do one more batch
of dumplings or just let it go?

12:43.388 --> 12:45.974
- Let it go.
- Sorry, but we are in a rush.

12:46.016 --> 12:47.559
- That's okay.

12:47.600 --> 12:48.935
- We are running very short
on time here, Maya.

12:48.977 --> 12:50.645
- I'm running very short
on nails; I'm very nervous.

12:50.687 --> 12:51.980
- You think we're gonna
get it done?

12:52.022 --> 12:54.441
- Yeah.
- This one got overpoured.

12:54.482 --> 12:55.608
- How do I do it?

12:55.650 --> 12:57.652
- Okay.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

12:57.694 --> 12:59.279
Just--just let me breathe.

12:59.320 --> 13:00.739
- Oh, I'm so nervous.
I can't look.

13:00.780 --> 13:04.367
I can't see you, Andy.
- The stress has blinded you.

13:04.409 --> 13:05.326
- Oh!

13:05.368 --> 13:06.369
- You can always
open your eyes.

13:06.411 --> 13:08.371
- Get some green
and purple glitter.

13:08.413 --> 13:09.956
- Yep.
- And put that on top.

13:09.998 --> 13:10.999
- Okay.
- That looks beautiful.

13:11.041 --> 13:12.459
- Okay.

13:12.500 --> 13:15.754
Five...four...three...
- Last one on.

13:15.795 --> 13:18.590
Two...one!

13:18.631 --> 13:20.383
- Time's up!

13:20.425 --> 13:22.594
Ovens off.
- Mitts down.

13:22.635 --> 13:24.763
- That was the fastest
45 minutes...

13:24.804 --> 13:25.930
Of my life.

13:28.975 --> 13:31.770
<i>♪ ♪</i>

13:31.811 --> 13:34.064
- Oh, my.

13:39.277 --> 13:41.571
- All right, Steve and Tom,
please come up.

13:42.530 --> 13:44.491
- Hi, ladies, grannies.
- Hi.

13:44.532 --> 13:46.034
- Andy.
- Pretty, pretty, pretty.

13:46.076 --> 13:48.119
- Very pretty.

13:48.161 --> 13:49.913
- Our White Elephant gift
was a box of pancake mix.

13:49.954 --> 13:51.289
- Oh.

13:51.331 --> 13:53.166
<i>- So we made chicken
and dumplings.</i>

13:53.208 --> 13:54.918
- Thank you.
- Beautiful.

13:54.959 --> 13:56.169
- Good ol' comfort food.

13:56.211 --> 13:58.338
- In the dumplings
are thyme and parsley.

13:58.380 --> 14:00.090
We did our best
to shred some chicken.

14:00.131 --> 14:01.341
And then there's just
little black pepper

14:01.383 --> 14:03.885
and parsley garnish on top.

14:03.927 --> 14:05.595
- Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm!

14:07.180 --> 14:10.475
My mom used to make chicken
and dumplings all of the time.

14:10.517 --> 14:14.312
And I'm pretty sure, Mom,
you would say,

14:14.354 --> 14:16.481
"Gosh, I wish I would have
made it like this."

14:16.523 --> 14:18.858
I'm telling you,
it's really, really good.

14:18.900 --> 14:21.569
- This is one
of my favorite comfort foods.

14:21.611 --> 14:24.322
And you presented it
beautifully.

14:24.364 --> 14:27.033
- You made this out
of pancake mix?

14:27.075 --> 14:28.159
- Wow.
- I mean,

14:28.201 --> 14:30.995
you really transformed
that ingredient.

14:31.037 --> 14:31.996
- Thank you.

14:32.038 --> 14:34.332
- I can appreciate

14:34.374 --> 14:37.377
the substitution
with the pancake mix.

14:37.419 --> 14:39.295
I'm the queen
of the hacks at home.

14:39.337 --> 14:41.339
One time, I'm running out
of tomato gravy, you know,

14:41.381 --> 14:45.927
pot meatballs and spaghetti,
the only thing I had on hand

14:45.969 --> 14:48.221
were two bottles
of Bloody Mary mix.

14:49.180 --> 14:51.016
And I put it in.

14:51.057 --> 14:53.727
I want you to know, it made
the tomato gravy really nice.

14:53.768 --> 14:55.854
The kids didn't mind.
They never knew about it.

14:55.895 --> 14:59.024
So you did a good job
with that pancake mix.

14:59.065 --> 15:00.608
Thank you.

15:00.650 --> 15:01.943
<i>- Niyati and Abhi.
- Oh, my.</i>

15:01.985 --> 15:04.404
<i>- Wow.
- It's beautiful.</i>

15:04.446 --> 15:09.868
- So for our White Elephant,
we had cinnamon rolls, but--

15:09.909 --> 15:11.286
- Our friends over there.
- Jonah and Patrick.

15:11.327 --> 15:13.163
They stole it from us,
and we got their biscuits.

15:13.204 --> 15:14.330
- Shame on you. Shame on you.

15:14.372 --> 15:17.459
- So we made fried donut holes.

15:17.500 --> 15:18.668
<i>- Wow.</i>

15:18.710 --> 15:22.464
- So they have raspberry
and apricot filling.

15:22.505 --> 15:23.923
- Wow.

15:23.965 --> 15:26.718
- With toasted cumin, coconut
flakes, and fennel seeds.

15:26.760 --> 15:30.972
- I'll tell you,
the presentation is exquisite.

15:31.014 --> 15:32.557
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

15:32.599 --> 15:34.934
- I would have never known
that this was a biscuit.

15:34.976 --> 15:36.561
- That jelly was delicious.

15:36.603 --> 15:39.022
And I would have absolutely
loved to taste more of that.

15:39.064 --> 15:40.106
- So good. So good.
- Thank you.

15:40.148 --> 15:41.441
- And I want you to know,

15:41.483 --> 15:44.486
I know donut holes
from New Orleans.

15:44.527 --> 15:45.945
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, we eat them a lot.

15:45.987 --> 15:50.575
- This is the lightest
donut hole I have ever enjoyed.

15:50.617 --> 15:52.160
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

15:52.202 --> 15:53.703
- Thank you.
- It's just so cute to eat.

15:53.745 --> 15:55.538
It looks just like y'all.

15:55.580 --> 15:56.498
- Oh, thank you.

16:01.169 --> 16:03.755
- Jessica and Stephanie,
please come up.

16:03.797 --> 16:06.424
- Hi, grannies.
- This looks pretty.

16:06.466 --> 16:09.010
That looks pretty.
- It does.

16:09.052 --> 16:12.472
<i>- So our White Elephant gift
was pudding mix.</i>

16:12.514 --> 16:15.016
<i>So we had chocolate
and vanilla pudding.</i>

16:15.058 --> 16:16.267
So with the vanilla pudding,

16:16.309 --> 16:18.269
we made the little
chocolate chip cookie cup.

16:18.311 --> 16:20.605
And then we also made
a chocolate ice cream

16:20.647 --> 16:23.066
and a Mexican hot
chocolate hot fudge

16:23.108 --> 16:24.401
out of
the chocolate pudding mix.

16:24.442 --> 16:26.778
- Oh, boy.
- Clever. Clever.

16:26.820 --> 16:29.322
- Wow.
- I think it's very festive.

16:29.364 --> 16:31.074
I love hot fudge.

16:31.116 --> 16:32.200
- Yes.
- Agreed.

16:32.242 --> 16:33.493
- Mmm, mmm.

16:33.535 --> 16:35.161
- I should have this
for breakfast every day.

16:35.203 --> 16:36.329
- Yeah.
- Right?

16:36.371 --> 16:38.081
- I'm ashamed to tell you I do.

16:39.499 --> 16:43.795
- The transformation of
your ingredient is great.

16:43.837 --> 16:45.296
- Oh, good.
- The cookie itself,

16:45.338 --> 16:47.799
it's really good,
very flavorful.

16:47.841 --> 16:49.968
The ice cream,
I would have liked

16:50.010 --> 16:51.511
just a little bit more flavor,

16:51.553 --> 16:53.096
maybe some vanilla bean
or something like that.

16:53.138 --> 16:55.473
- Okay.
- Pudding ice cream.

16:55.515 --> 16:58.101
It's such
a wonderful revelation.

16:58.143 --> 17:00.895
I'd never thought of pudding--
ice cream out of pudding.

17:00.937 --> 17:04.315
And it invited you in,
and it didn't disappoint you.

17:04.357 --> 17:06.776
That's what I love.
- Whew.

17:08.028 --> 17:09.612
<i>- Jonah and Patrick.</i>

17:09.654 --> 17:12.699
- So our White Elephant
that we borrowed

17:12.741 --> 17:16.703
from our good friends was
a can of cinnamon rolls.

17:16.745 --> 17:20.040
So our hack is
to make a king cake.

17:20.081 --> 17:21.332
- Wow.
- So king cake,

17:21.374 --> 17:22.792
for those of you
who are not familiar,

17:22.834 --> 17:24.669
is often served
during Mardi Gras season,

17:24.711 --> 17:27.839
which begins on the Epiphany.

17:27.881 --> 17:30.008
And we're not gonna have you
risk which cake piece

17:30.050 --> 17:31.426
<i>has the baby.</i>

17:31.468 --> 17:34.512
<i>So we've made for you
four baby marzipans.</i>

17:34.554 --> 17:35.972
And my favorite part
about the tradition is,

17:36.014 --> 17:38.850
whoever gets the baby
has to make the next king cake.

17:38.892 --> 17:40.352
So we are hoping
that the four of you

17:40.393 --> 17:41.811
will make king cakes
for us one day.

17:41.853 --> 17:43.521
- That's right. So that's
why there's four babies

17:43.563 --> 17:46.858
- Only if we can use the hack.
- Yes, of course.

17:46.900 --> 17:50.737
- The flavor, the cinnamon and
all, is really coming through.

17:50.779 --> 17:52.822
- The texture came out
very nice.

17:52.864 --> 17:54.574
- No. I don't--I don't agree
with you on that one.

17:54.616 --> 17:55.784
- What, you don't agree on?
- I think it's undercooked.

17:55.825 --> 17:56.743
- Do you think so?
- Underbaked.

17:56.785 --> 17:58.203
- Hmm.
- Yeah. I really do.

17:58.244 --> 18:00.038
- I'm disappointed
that it wasn't

18:00.080 --> 18:02.457
disassembled and braided.

18:02.499 --> 18:03.708
- When we were growing up,

18:03.750 --> 18:05.460
we would have
king cake parties.

18:05.502 --> 18:07.379
And Mom would always--
not my mom only,

18:07.420 --> 18:09.589
but everybody's mom,
"Don't get the baby!"

18:09.631 --> 18:11.091
- That's the last word
you heard is,

18:11.132 --> 18:12.676
"Don't get the baby!"
- "Don't get the baby!"

18:12.717 --> 18:14.177
- Because that meant you had
to give the next party.

18:14.219 --> 18:16.388
- It was a party.

18:16.429 --> 18:18.264
- I've gotten the baby once.

18:18.306 --> 18:19.683
- Really?
- You got the baby once?

18:19.724 --> 18:21.893
- I did.
I haven't thrown the party yet.

18:21.935 --> 18:23.853
- Are people still waiting
for an invitation?

18:23.895 --> 18:25.313
- That's not good, right,
when you get the baby

18:25.355 --> 18:26.564
and you don't throw the party?

18:26.606 --> 18:27.607
- No, indeed,
how many years has it been?

18:27.649 --> 18:30.777
- Probably like five.

18:39.035 --> 18:41.663
- Bakers, we learned some
great kitchen hacks

18:41.705 --> 18:42.997
in our
White Elephant challenge.

18:43.039 --> 18:45.041
- And I learned that stealing
from friends

18:45.083 --> 18:47.752
is fun and delicious
if you say it's a game.

18:49.087 --> 18:52.424
Grannies, whose White Elephant
will you never forget?

18:52.465 --> 18:55.010
- Today, we tasted
some wonderful hacks.

18:55.051 --> 18:58.513
They were all really creative
and well done.

18:58.555 --> 18:59.848
But one really stood out.

18:59.889 --> 19:03.309
Our winner
of this challenge is...

19:06.271 --> 19:08.356
<i>♪ ♪</i>

19:08.398 --> 19:10.525
Niyati and Abhi.

19:10.567 --> 19:13.945
- Yes!

19:13.987 --> 19:17.866
- Niyati and Abhi, the reason
we picked your bake today

19:17.907 --> 19:22.078
was because not only did you
take a simple can of biscuits

19:22.120 --> 19:24.831
and turn it into such
a delightful donut hole,

19:24.873 --> 19:27.417
but the way you put
your flavors together,

19:27.459 --> 19:29.586
they all combined so well

19:29.627 --> 19:32.922
that it made it a huge surprise
when we tasted it.

19:32.964 --> 19:35.467
- Come and get your brooch!
- Yeah, guys.

19:35.508 --> 19:36.843
- Good job, guys.

19:36.885 --> 19:38.845
- I found some darling
little elephant brooches.

19:38.887 --> 19:39.971
- Aw!
- Thank you so much.

19:40.013 --> 19:41.598
- There you go.

19:41.639 --> 19:42.932
- Kudos to you both.
- Thank you.

19:42.974 --> 19:44.267
- Whoo-hoo!
- Whoo! Yay!

19:44.309 --> 19:45.727
- We won another one.

19:45.769 --> 19:48.313
<i>- Jonah and Patrick
stole our White Elephant.</i>

19:48.355 --> 19:51.149
<i>- So there was a lot
of last-minute thinking</i>

19:51.191 --> 19:52.484
which went into the recipes.

19:52.525 --> 19:55.070
<i>- So I feel so blessed...
- Yeah.</i>

19:55.111 --> 19:58.073
So blessed, so grateful.
- That we have three brooches.

19:58.114 --> 19:59.949
<i>- You know, it's just an honor
to share the same room</i>

19:59.991 --> 20:01.368
<i>with all these amazing bakers.</i>

20:01.409 --> 20:02.744
- Good job, guys.

20:02.786 --> 20:04.871
- I learn from them
on a daily basis.

20:04.913 --> 20:06.122
- Good job.

20:08.041 --> 20:10.627
- We all know
that looks can be deceiving,

20:10.669 --> 20:13.129
but honestly, some looks
are just tight as hell,

20:13.171 --> 20:14.464
so don't be a hater.

20:14.506 --> 20:16.341
- In today's
Pie in the Sky Challenge,

20:16.383 --> 20:20.428
we want to see the best-looking
pie you can bake.

20:20.470 --> 20:22.222
<i>- It's called Eyes on the Pies</i>

20:22.263 --> 20:24.516
<i>because we're not looking
for an ordinary pie.</i>

20:24.557 --> 20:25.934
<i>- No, no, no.</i>

20:25.975 --> 20:29.270
We want bespoke designs,
tailored looks.

20:29.312 --> 20:31.314
- Style, clothes, jorts.

20:31.356 --> 20:35.443
- Like every pie I've ever had,
it better taste good.

20:35.485 --> 20:36.569
But we'll give you extra points

20:36.611 --> 20:38.363
for intricate designs
- and 3
- D features.

20:38.405 --> 20:39.572
- You have two hours to make

20:39.614 --> 20:41.116
the hottest pie
you've ever baked.

20:41.157 --> 20:42.992
So, bakers...

20:43.034 --> 20:45.078
let's get bakin'!

20:47.205 --> 20:50.500
Bake us proud.
- Ooh, now that's good.

20:52.043 --> 20:53.962
- Do you want
two onions or one?

20:54.004 --> 20:55.380
- Two.
- Can I have an onion?

20:55.422 --> 20:57.048
Thank you.

20:57.090 --> 21:00.885
<i>- We are making a Washington
apple and sweet cherry pie</i>

21:00.927 --> 21:04.848
<i>with some spices like cinnamon
and ginger and nutmeg.</i>

21:06.975 --> 21:08.435
- Look at these
pretty little fellas.

21:08.476 --> 21:09.894
Hi, everybody.

21:09.936 --> 21:11.646
- Oh, I thought
you were talking about us.

21:11.688 --> 21:12.981
- You too.

21:13.023 --> 21:14.399
- Don't talk about me
like I'm not right here.

21:14.441 --> 21:16.484
- We're making lobster pie.

21:16.526 --> 21:17.986
- Lobster potpie.

21:18.028 --> 21:20.280
<i>- This pie is super important
to us.</i>

21:20.321 --> 21:22.741
You know, we want to get into
the finals to win this thing.

21:22.782 --> 21:24.659
But, you know,
we're with incredible bakers.

21:24.701 --> 21:26.786
And so the competition
is fierce.

21:26.828 --> 21:30.331
- We are making a pork,
apple cider, and sage pie.

21:30.373 --> 21:32.834
- Abhinav, I'm going
I'm doing three tomatoes.

21:32.876 --> 21:34.085
- Okay.
- Oh, we're making--

21:34.127 --> 21:36.546
- We're making a chicken
tikka masala pie...

21:36.588 --> 21:38.173
<i>- Pie.</i>

21:38.214 --> 21:40.717
<i>- Which would be like a rich,
creamy, velvety texture.</i>

21:41.885 --> 21:44.304
- This is the
Pie in the Sky challenge.

21:44.346 --> 21:46.389
<i>And it's actually
a pie this time.</i>

21:46.431 --> 21:47.849
- What would you do if you
looked up in the sky

21:47.891 --> 21:49.267
and there really was a pie?

21:49.309 --> 21:51.227
- I think I'd cry.

21:51.269 --> 21:52.187
- That's no lie.

21:52.228 --> 21:53.855
- So as thin
as I can get them.

21:53.897 --> 21:56.358
You don't want them
so thin they're gonna tear.

21:56.399 --> 21:58.693
- I love a pie.

21:58.735 --> 22:00.862
Don't ask me why,
but I love pie.

22:00.904 --> 22:04.324
- Oh, my God.
- Why, oh, why?

22:04.366 --> 22:07.577
You might say I too love pie.

22:07.619 --> 22:11.373
But no one can deny
how I love pie.

22:11.414 --> 22:14.417
- It's like being held hostage
by your friend's kids.

22:14.459 --> 22:17.170
"Now look at this dance."

22:20.298 --> 22:23.051
- Patrick, screw those.
Let's try these instead.

22:23.093 --> 22:24.135
- Wanna use Granny Smith
instead?

22:24.177 --> 22:25.053
- Yes.

22:25.095 --> 22:26.012
Where I grew up in the Midwest,

22:26.054 --> 22:27.764
<i>pie was at every meal.</i>

22:27.806 --> 22:29.933
It was at every special
gathering.

22:29.974 --> 22:31.226
Why don't you
cut a bunch of these

22:31.267 --> 22:32.769
and then start painting them
a little bit?

22:32.811 --> 22:34.354
<i>But this pie
that we have to do</i>

22:34.396 --> 22:37.190
for this challenge
had better be spectacular.

22:37.232 --> 22:38.858
And we're gonna try to take
all of the lessons

22:38.900 --> 22:40.360
that the grannies
have taught us.

22:40.402 --> 22:43.488
Attention to detail,
perfect bake, unique flavors.

22:43.530 --> 22:45.699
<i>All that kind of stuff.
We need to get it right.</i>

22:45.740 --> 22:47.909
- Oh, look who it is,
Jonah and Patrick.

22:47.951 --> 22:49.285
- Gosh, Mandy.
- Hey, guys.

22:49.327 --> 22:51.162
- We just came to see
what you guys are up to.

22:51.204 --> 22:54.541
- Oh. Well, we're making a
pork, apple cider, and sage pie

22:54.582 --> 22:57.210
<i>with a lot of filigree
in the shape of holly berries.</i>

22:57.252 --> 22:59.421
<i>This is sort of an invention
based on something</i>

22:59.462 --> 23:00.672
that we do at the holidays.

23:00.714 --> 23:01.923
So we didn't have
a lot of money growing up.

23:01.965 --> 23:03.925
So my mom would host
tea parties

23:03.967 --> 23:05.260
to sort of teach the kids
how to--

23:05.301 --> 23:07.262
what it would be like
to eat in restaurants

23:07.303 --> 23:08.430
and, like, how to have class
'cause...

23:08.471 --> 23:09.848
- What a good idea.

23:09.889 --> 23:11.474
- You know, money
doesn't buy class.

23:11.516 --> 23:14.561
- Wait a minute, I disagree.
- Maya would argue yes.

23:14.602 --> 23:15.812
- Yes.

23:15.854 --> 23:17.939
- She's always like,
"I love money!

23:17.981 --> 23:19.566
My name's Maya,
and I love money."

23:19.607 --> 23:20.942
- Money!
- "I like to make it.

23:20.984 --> 23:22.402
And I like to spend it."

23:22.444 --> 23:23.903
- Spend it.
- That's a spot-on impression.

23:23.945 --> 23:26.448
Thank you.
- Patrick knows me well.

23:26.489 --> 23:27.657
- And we've got a little trick
in the middle,

23:27.699 --> 23:29.200
a little pig pops up,

23:29.242 --> 23:31.119
and get some steam out of
- his mouth for the 3
- D component.

23:31.161 --> 23:32.287
- Get some what
out of his mouth?

23:32.328 --> 23:33.580
- Some steam.
- Thank you very much.

23:33.621 --> 23:34.539
- He wants to blow
off some steam.

23:34.581 --> 23:36.124
- He really does.
- Yeah.

23:36.166 --> 23:38.126
I misheard you the first time,
and I'm glad we cleared it up.

23:38.168 --> 23:40.628
- We have a little pie funnel
that is in the shape of a pig.

23:40.670 --> 23:42.756
<i>And its purpose is, of course,</i>

23:42.797 --> 23:44.007
<i>to let the steam
out of the pie.</i>

23:44.049 --> 23:46.009
But it actually has
a hole in the mouth.

23:46.051 --> 23:47.886
So it's a cute little trick
where the steam comes

23:47.927 --> 23:49.346
out of the mouth of the pig.

23:49.387 --> 23:52.515
And hopefully, this will be
my one last party trick

23:52.557 --> 23:53.892
that gets us to the finals.

23:53.933 --> 23:56.227
- How does it feel being
in the semifinals?

23:56.269 --> 23:57.645
- We could not be
more thrilled.

23:57.687 --> 23:59.773
- I think you are
in good company.

23:59.814 --> 24:01.608
- Best company. Best company.

24:01.649 --> 24:04.778
- We are. And at the end
of the day, if we don't win,

24:04.819 --> 24:05.987
one of our friends
is gonna win.

24:06.029 --> 24:07.822
And that is, like,
the most amazing thing.

24:07.864 --> 24:09.783
- There's actually a lot
of love in this room.

24:09.824 --> 24:11.201
- Absolutely.

24:11.242 --> 24:13.244
- I feel like we--
we created a little family.

24:13.286 --> 24:15.663
- It's really sweet.
- Yeah.

24:15.705 --> 24:17.624
- How's the crust coming,
Steph?

24:17.665 --> 24:20.001
- Oh, shoot.
- What? Did it tear?

24:20.043 --> 24:22.128
- The Space Needle broke.

24:23.046 --> 24:24.005
- How are you, guys?

24:24.047 --> 24:25.173
- Hi, guys!
- How are you?

24:25.215 --> 24:26.633
- What are you guys
making today?

24:26.675 --> 24:30.345
- We are making a Washington
apple and cherry pie

24:30.387 --> 24:34.057
with a skyline of Seattle
'cause that's where we grew up.

24:34.099 --> 24:35.016
So we just thought
that would be a great way

24:35.058 --> 24:36.976
to bring Christmas here.

24:37.018 --> 24:38.603
And we learned how to bake pies
from our grandma

24:38.645 --> 24:40.188
who lives in Washington.

24:40.230 --> 24:42.691
<i>So it all just
kind of goes together.</i>

24:42.732 --> 24:45.318
- Tell us more
about growing up.

24:45.360 --> 24:48.279
- Well, I'm kind of amazed
that I'm here because,

24:48.321 --> 24:49.823
growing up,
when I was a teenager,

24:49.864 --> 24:51.533
I had a pretty severe
eating disorder.

24:51.574 --> 24:54.661
And so, like, I didn't eat any
of the stuff that you see here.

24:54.703 --> 24:56.079
- Really?
- I was, like, afraid

24:56.121 --> 24:57.664
to touch things
like butter and oil

24:57.706 --> 24:59.624
'cause I was afraid
somehow, like, through osmosis,

24:59.666 --> 25:01.876
it would get into my body.

25:01.918 --> 25:04.337
I think when I look back
at my teenage self,

25:04.379 --> 25:07.007
<i>I would just want
to give her a hug and say,</i>

25:07.048 --> 25:09.426
<i>"Things will get better.
You can get better."</i>

25:09.467 --> 25:11.344
If I hadn't gone through
the struggles

25:11.386 --> 25:13.054
that I did as a teenager,

25:13.096 --> 25:15.849
I wouldn't have the confidence
now to approach challenges

25:15.890 --> 25:18.059
as something
that's overcome-able.

25:18.101 --> 25:19.644
- I'm just proud of Jessica
for being here

25:19.686 --> 25:23.189
and overcoming everything
that she has to--to make it.

25:23.231 --> 25:26.401
- I see such a strength
in you as sisters,

25:26.443 --> 25:27.986
and it seems like--
I mean, you're just--

25:28.028 --> 25:29.487
- Sure, sure.

25:29.529 --> 25:32.449
- It's really amazing
to see you work together.

25:32.490 --> 25:35.869
- I know, that--I mean,
it's great meeting you guys.

25:35.910 --> 25:37.704
Not gonna lie.
It's great baking.

25:37.746 --> 25:39.706
- Sure.
- Also not gonna lie.

25:39.748 --> 25:41.708
But this is probably
the best part.

25:41.750 --> 25:45.420
- It's nice to see two sisters
on the show cooking together.

25:45.462 --> 25:48.965
I wish I had a sister.
I wish we were sisters.

25:49.007 --> 25:52.093
- Okay, I'll be your sister.
- Thanks, Andy.

25:52.135 --> 25:55.221
- Do you want to braid my hair?

25:55.263 --> 25:56.097
- Yeah.

25:56.139 --> 25:58.058
Oh, God.
I love you so much.

26:03.355 --> 26:05.732
<i>- This is the Pie in the Sky.</i>

26:05.774 --> 26:07.817
I do love pie quite a bit.

26:07.859 --> 26:10.028
Let me--let me bring the lights
down for a minute.

26:10.070 --> 26:11.154
Let's get serious for a minute.

26:11.196 --> 26:13.865
I like the buttery,
flaky crust.

26:13.907 --> 26:18.244
<i>I think just about anything
tastes good inside of a crust.</i>

26:18.286 --> 26:20.580
<i>I don't need no icing.</i>

26:20.622 --> 26:22.540
I don't need no cake.

26:22.582 --> 26:23.875

27:38.867 --> 27:40.160
- No, I got that.

27:43.329 --> 27:45.290
- Do you know yet how many
of these you want to use?

27:45.331 --> 27:48.043
- Uh, probably, like, eight.

27:48.084 --> 27:49.627
- You do the ice cream
this time.

27:49.669 --> 27:50.754
- Okay.

27:50.795 --> 27:51.796
- You just add a little bit
at a time.

27:51.838 --> 27:52.964
- Okay.

27:53.006 --> 27:54.632
- Put your goggles on
and your gloves.

27:54.674 --> 27:57.093
We have a time crunch,
so we're making ice cream

27:57.135 --> 27:58.928
<i>and we're gonna use
liquid nitrogen.</i>

27:58.970 --> 28:01.639
When you pour too much at once,
it'll, like, freeze things

28:01.681 --> 28:04.559
solid before it gets a chance
to, like, aerate it.

28:04.601 --> 28:05.977
- For sure.

28:06.019 --> 28:07.562
- It should be like soft serve
by the time it's done.

28:07.604 --> 28:08.438
- Okay.

28:08.480 --> 28:10.106
- I think this is ambitious

28:10.148 --> 28:13.068
but I think we have
to bring it all out

28:13.109 --> 28:14.986
for this Pie in the Sky
Challenge.

28:15.028 --> 28:16.321
It's really good.

28:16.363 --> 28:18.031
- Right now, we are just
working on the curry.

28:18.073 --> 28:20.033
I hope all the grannies
like it.

28:20.075 --> 28:23.203
- Okay, this is the big one.
- Yep. This is the semifinal.

28:23.244 --> 28:24.204
- Yep.
- Yes.

28:28.375 --> 28:30.502

28:36.925 --> 28:38.301
<i>- I love pie.</i>

28:38.343 --> 28:39.511
- Let me tell you.

28:39.552 --> 28:43.014
The Pie in the Sky is my jam.
- Mm-hmm.

28:43.056 --> 28:47.310
- I am really
a pie connoisseur.

28:47.352 --> 28:49.521
- Mm.
- I bake pies all the time,

28:49.562 --> 28:51.564
<i>won awards
on sweet and savory.</i>

28:51.606 --> 28:56.486
<i>So for the sweet, I'm looking
for that flaky crust.</i>

28:56.528 --> 28:58.071
That's gonna be real important.

28:58.113 --> 29:01.324
To see if they actually put
that cold butter, you know,

29:01.366 --> 29:02.409
<i>in that pie fillings.</i>

29:02.450 --> 29:04.369
- I just need, like,
two tablespoons.

29:04.411 --> 29:09.416
- But now talk about savory,
you know, I'm Team Savory.

29:09.457 --> 29:12.419
- Very, very happy
with my lobsters today.

29:12.460 --> 29:14.713
<i>- And I like a filling
that has a good mouthfeel.</i>

29:14.754 --> 29:17.382
And one of the things
I love to see on a pie...

29:17.424 --> 29:18.842
<i>- Mm-hmm.
- Is a decorative crust.</i>

29:18.883 --> 29:21.928
- Do you think
this is good placement?

29:21.970 --> 29:23.263
Yeah, it is.

29:23.304 --> 29:24.806
- Seattle is known
for its rain.

29:24.848 --> 29:27.976
So we're gonna do
a little border of raindrops

29:28.018 --> 29:29.436
around the edge of the pie.

29:29.477 --> 29:33.189
- I'm neither a pie connoisseur
or a piemaker,

29:33.231 --> 29:34.566
but I know what I like.

29:34.607 --> 29:36.693
<i>- Exactly.
- And I'm looking for--</i>

29:36.735 --> 29:38.570
<i>if it's apple,
I want to taste apple.</i>

29:38.611 --> 29:40.447
- Our big thing is trying
to flavor...

29:40.488 --> 29:42.073
- We just want the flavor.
- In the lobster pie.

29:42.115 --> 29:44.284
- We want the flavor of lobster
to come through really strong.

29:44.325 --> 29:47.454
- Pie can really lend a lot
to a holiday meal.

29:47.495 --> 29:50.582
- During festivals,
all you think is comfort food

29:50.623 --> 29:53.335
and, like, something
which is rich, cozy.

29:53.376 --> 29:56.254
I think this would hit
all the right notes for that.

29:56.296 --> 29:58.673
<i>- Pies at Christmas
and Thanksgiving</i>

29:58.715 --> 30:00.383
<i>are traditional.</i>

30:00.425 --> 30:03.386
And they would be missed.
They would be missed.

30:03.428 --> 30:06.598
- Hmm, let's take a peek.
- Okay.

30:06.639 --> 30:07.807
- Do-doink.

30:09.684 --> 30:10.727
- Good!

30:10.769 --> 30:12.771
- How are the lobsters
coming along?

30:12.812 --> 30:14.439
- They're coming.

30:14.481 --> 30:16.107
I promise I'll salt
everything in that.

30:16.149 --> 30:17.525
- Thank you.

30:17.567 --> 30:20.278
- We decided we would try to do
a lobster potpie.

30:20.320 --> 30:24.115
<i>I am concerned about getting
the flavor of the lobster</i>

30:24.157 --> 30:25.575
<i>into the filling.</i>

30:25.617 --> 30:27.577
So I cook the lobsters
in a pan,

30:27.619 --> 30:29.496
<i>I get the pan
cracking and sizzling.</i>

30:29.537 --> 30:31.790
<i>I want the shell to be</i>

30:31.831 --> 30:34.000
<i>somewhat red and burnt
a little bit</i>

30:34.042 --> 30:35.335
<i>so that the flavors come out.</i>

30:35.377 --> 30:37.712
<i>Then I'll deglaze it
with some brandy.</i>

30:37.754 --> 30:40.173
<i>We are very restricted
by time here.</i>

30:40.215 --> 30:42.676
And that's a concern
right now for me.

30:42.717 --> 30:44.052
- Tom and Steve,
what's up, you guys?

30:44.094 --> 30:45.303
You in the middle of something?
- Hi. How are you?

30:45.345 --> 30:46.471
- Oh, my goodness.

30:46.513 --> 30:47.806
- Did you just put a lobster
in a pot?

30:47.847 --> 30:49.849
- I just put the claws in.
- What are you making?

30:49.891 --> 30:53.478
- We're making our traditional
lobster dinner for Christmas.

30:53.520 --> 30:54.979
The lobster potpie.

30:55.021 --> 30:58.233
The tradition came from me
being in the seafood business

30:58.274 --> 30:59.442
<i>in the D.C. area</i>

30:59.484 --> 31:00.944
before any of my kids
were born.

31:00.985 --> 31:02.862
So I would bring lobsters home
every Christmas.

31:02.904 --> 31:05.532
My sister was always
a part of our family.

31:05.573 --> 31:07.033
<i>It was totally
her favorite meal.</i>

31:07.075 --> 31:08.326
<i>She was my wife's best friend.</i>

31:08.368 --> 31:09.703
She was--she was
my best friend.

31:09.744 --> 31:13.039
And so 20 years ago,
October 30th, she died.

31:13.081 --> 31:16.626
The biggest hole in my life
has been the loss of Jo.

31:16.668 --> 31:18.378
<i>I cherish my memories of her.</i>

31:18.420 --> 31:21.965
<i>She was funny.
She was witty and smart.</i>

31:22.007 --> 31:23.508
- I think that our main goal

31:23.550 --> 31:27.512
in doing this pie
is truly representing Joanne.

31:27.554 --> 31:29.556
- So you still do lobster
every Christmas.

31:29.597 --> 31:31.266
- We do. We do.
- Since this is about pies,

31:31.307 --> 31:33.935
do you guys make pies often?
- I do.

31:33.977 --> 31:36.354
That's been my Thanksgiving
thing my whole life.

31:36.396 --> 31:39.524
- It smells fantastic.
- Looks good, yeah.

31:39.566 --> 31:41.693
- Heyo.
- You frightened me just now,

31:41.735 --> 31:43.528
but I see that there
was a method to your madness.

31:43.570 --> 31:44.529
Look at that big hunk
of lobster.

31:44.571 --> 31:46.656
- I'm about to--
- That's the claw.

31:46.698 --> 31:48.450
- I'm about to put that
in my mouth.

31:48.491 --> 31:50.744
- We are trying
to make it a half--

31:51.870 --> 31:54.414
- Don't kill me, man!
I'm so sorry.

31:54.456 --> 31:56.207
- Look at that meat.
Look at that fresh meat.

31:56.249 --> 31:57.542
- I'll be good! I'll be good!
- Oh!

31:57.584 --> 31:59.878
- I swear to God,
I'll be good, Tom.

31:59.919 --> 32:01.004
Oh! Ow!

32:01.046 --> 32:02.672
- Hiya!
- Jesus!

32:02.714 --> 32:05.133
- Did Tom chill with a knife?

32:05.175 --> 32:07.677
- I thought he was gonna
take a finger off, for sure.

32:07.719 --> 32:09.888
- I thought he was gonna
take my finger off.

32:09.929 --> 32:11.431
- Abhi and Niyati,
how you doing?

32:11.473 --> 32:14.434
- We can't find black pepper.
- I have some.

32:14.476 --> 32:16.394
- Oh, you have some?
- Thank you so much.

32:16.436 --> 32:18.313
- Thank you.

32:18.355 --> 32:20.315
- Niyati and Abhi.
- Hi, guys.

32:20.357 --> 32:21.524
How are you?

32:21.566 --> 32:23.026
- What are you making?

32:23.068 --> 32:25.737
- So we are making
the chicken tikka masala pie.

32:25.779 --> 32:27.655
<i>- The inside has
tikka masala sauce,</i>

32:27.697 --> 32:32.035
which is a rich, creamy,
velvety tomato-based sauce

32:32.077 --> 32:33.370
<i>infused with ginger,</i>

32:33.411 --> 32:35.497
<i>garlic, cumin,</i>

32:35.538 --> 32:37.082
<i>the tandoori masala,</i>

32:37.123 --> 32:39.501
a little bit of yogurt in
the marination of the chicken.

32:39.542 --> 32:40.835
Little bit of cream.

32:40.877 --> 32:44.339
<i>And a lot of dried
fenugreek leaves.</i>

32:44.381 --> 32:46.633
It's kind of
a quintessential Indian dish.

32:46.675 --> 32:48.510
- Yes!

32:48.551 --> 32:50.929
- So we don't cook a lot
of pies back home in India.

32:50.970 --> 32:54.349
But when we think of pie,
we think of, you know,

32:54.391 --> 32:56.768
family togetherness
and family gatherings.

32:56.810 --> 33:00.105
We haven't been home
in the past three years now.

33:00.146 --> 33:03.817
- But whenever we go back home
to India, on the dinner table,

33:03.858 --> 33:06.778
we have chicken tikka masala,
which is everybody's favorite.

33:06.820 --> 33:11.741
- Isn't pie magical that you
can put most things, not all...

33:11.783 --> 33:12.701
Yes.

33:12.742 --> 33:14.244
- But most things
in a piecrust?

33:14.285 --> 33:15.328
- That's correct.
- Yeah.

33:15.370 --> 33:16.913
- That's why pie is the best.

33:16.955 --> 33:19.624
- Pie just gives us, like,
those--you know,

33:19.666 --> 33:22.335
that rich and cozy feeling.

33:22.377 --> 33:25.755
- Speaking of rich, you guys
have a lot of hardware going.

33:25.797 --> 33:28.174
- How does it feel to be
in the semifinals, guys?

33:28.216 --> 33:30.343
- It feels great.
- It feels...

33:30.385 --> 33:31.469
We feel blessed.
- We're very grateful.

33:31.511 --> 33:32.971
- Who has the
most brooches so far?

33:33.013 --> 33:34.723
Us.

33:34.764 --> 33:36.808
- That's got to feel
pretty good.

33:36.850 --> 33:38.643
It's a huge deal.

33:38.685 --> 33:40.020
- Where did you put
those red berries?

33:40.061 --> 33:41.855
- Right here.

33:41.896 --> 33:43.940
- Oh, they turned out nice.
- Yeah, they look great.

33:43.982 --> 33:45.316
- All right.
You've got your vision.

33:45.358 --> 33:46.693
I'm just gonna let you
roll with it.

33:46.735 --> 33:49.863
- I think piecrust is
an incredibly important part

33:49.904 --> 33:51.406
of any pie.

33:51.448 --> 33:53.033
That's too short.

33:53.074 --> 33:55.326
- The design we decided on is
gonna be like a spoke design.

33:55.368 --> 33:56.828
So it's gonna be geometric.

33:56.870 --> 33:58.038
Yeah, I think that is
the way to do it.

33:58.079 --> 33:59.456
Do you agree
that you switch them?

33:59.497 --> 34:00.832
- Yeah, it's great.

34:00.874 --> 34:03.335
- We're gonna set up
just a center hole,

34:03.376 --> 34:06.463
<i>where we're gonna be able
to have a cooked lobster claw.</i>

34:06.504 --> 34:07.714
So it's very obvious
to the judges that this

34:07.756 --> 34:09.466
is in fact a lobster pie.

34:09.507 --> 34:11.092
Good to go.

34:11.134 --> 34:13.136
- I'm smelling this aroma.

34:13.178 --> 34:16.848
<i>And some smells like seafood.
Like fish maybe. I'm not sure.</i>

34:16.890 --> 34:18.308
- There it is.

34:18.350 --> 34:20.101
- Bake, sweet baby.

34:20.143 --> 34:22.103
- You gotta keep an eye
on that oven.

34:22.145 --> 34:25.106
- Gigi is the pie connoisseur
of grannies.

34:25.148 --> 34:28.109
We would love to hear
Gigi Diggity on this one.

34:28.151 --> 34:30.612
- We're keeping a close eye
on how Gigi Sherri

34:30.653 --> 34:33.573
reacts to the pies
because she has an entire room

34:33.615 --> 34:35.742
of blue ribbons
all won for her pies.

34:35.784 --> 34:37.786
So she's kind
of the expert here.

34:37.827 --> 34:39.162
It's always interesting,
though.

34:39.204 --> 34:40.372
Like, when someone
has a lot of blue ribbons.

34:40.413 --> 34:42.165
- Mm-hmm.
- You can always just, like,

34:42.207 --> 34:45.043
go on Amazon and buy
a bunch of blue ribbons.

34:45.085 --> 34:47.212
Funniest guy!

34:47.253 --> 34:50.757
- Or like, "I'm a total idiot."

34:54.803 --> 34:56.304
Did I--did I strike a nerve?

34:56.346 --> 34:59.099
- Just don't know why I would
buy one that says that,

34:59.140 --> 35:00.809
'cause I'm smart.

35:06.690 --> 35:08.775
♪ Eyes on the pies ♪

35:08.817 --> 35:10.944
♪ It's high time for pie time ♪

35:10.985 --> 35:13.029
♪ You're not gonna
believe your eyes ♪

35:13.071 --> 35:15.907
♪ When you realize
some of these pies are pies ♪

35:15.949 --> 35:18.702
- 'Cause they're fancy.

35:22.706 --> 35:24.499
- How much time we got left?
17.

35:24.541 --> 35:25.875
- This has only been
in 31 minutes.

35:25.917 --> 35:27.377
First and foremost,
we're tight on time.

35:27.419 --> 35:29.170
<i>Lobster is a mild flavor,
so I think it's hard</i>

35:29.212 --> 35:34.467
to get that concentrated dose
of lobster without time.

35:34.509 --> 35:35.844
- You like the color?
- Yeah.

35:35.885 --> 35:37.429
- I mean, I think we have
to keep it in longer.

35:37.470 --> 35:38.805
- Yeah, absolutely.

35:38.847 --> 35:40.849
<i>- I'm not sure how long
till the pie comes out.</i>

35:40.890 --> 35:42.517
We're just kind of watching it

35:42.559 --> 35:44.477
to see that
it's cooking through.

35:44.519 --> 35:45.395
- We're working
on the sauce here.

35:45.437 --> 35:46.855
- Working on the sauce.

35:46.896 --> 35:49.024
So we're just waiting
for the pie to come out. And...

35:49.065 --> 35:51.776
- Patience, patience.
- We need patience.

35:51.818 --> 35:53.695
- Life advice.
- Okay.

35:53.737 --> 35:55.822
- "Get over it."
- Always good.

35:55.864 --> 35:57.073
- There's nothing you can do
about a lot of stuff.

35:57.115 --> 35:59.534
Just move on.
- I love that.

35:59.576 --> 36:00.994
- And one other thing too.

36:01.036 --> 36:01.995
Be yourself.

36:02.037 --> 36:03.705
- Unless you're having
a bad day

36:03.747 --> 36:05.040
and you don't like yourself.

36:05.081 --> 36:07.500
Maybe those days
you can be somebody else.

36:07.542 --> 36:09.169
- During the holidays,
there are people

36:09.210 --> 36:12.839
that don't have that love
in their life.

36:12.881 --> 36:15.633
And so if you can just say
some--you never know.

36:15.675 --> 36:18.345
- It's a smile.
- Just a smile.

36:18.386 --> 36:20.221
Just a little hello.

36:20.263 --> 36:22.390
They may be just looking
just for that.

36:22.432 --> 36:23.808
- Sure.

36:23.850 --> 36:27.228
- 10-minute warning, bakers.
"Crust" the process.

36:27.270 --> 36:28.188
- Ew!

36:28.229 --> 36:31.608
- I don't know
how it's looking.

36:31.649 --> 36:32.942
We are the underdogs
in this competition.

36:32.984 --> 36:34.277
- Yes.

36:34.319 --> 36:36.696
<i>- All of the other teams
have multiple brooches.</i>

36:36.738 --> 36:37.906
- Oh, God.

36:37.947 --> 36:39.741
<i>We've had real highs,</i>

36:39.783 --> 36:41.201
and then we've been
very close to the bottom.

36:41.242 --> 36:43.244
So we need to show them
with this pie

36:43.286 --> 36:46.664
that we are good enough
to stand with the best.

36:46.706 --> 36:48.166
It's not browning
in the middle.

36:49.542 --> 36:51.127
Open it, please.

36:53.421 --> 36:59.094
- Five minutes, which is only
slightly more than 3.141592--

36:59.135 --> 37:00.595
- You're gonna get a pie
in the face

37:00.637 --> 37:02.722
if you say another number.

37:02.764 --> 37:04.724
- Six. Hey!

37:07.977 --> 37:10.230
- Ooh. Wowzer.
That's much better though.

37:10.271 --> 37:12.357
- I don't think
it's gonna stick.

37:12.399 --> 37:14.192
Nope.

37:14.234 --> 37:15.652
- You want to put
a little butter on it first,

37:15.694 --> 37:17.946
a brush of butter,
so it's shiny?

37:19.364 --> 37:21.324
- Okay. Ice cream.

37:22.200 --> 37:27.455
<i>Five...four...three...
two...one!</i>

37:28.498 --> 37:29.541
- Time is up!

37:29.582 --> 37:30.959
- Whoo!
- Yay!

37:31.001 --> 37:34.421
- Yeah, guys! We did it.
- Happy pie challenge.

37:37.549 --> 37:39.634
- Oh, wow.
- Yes. Gorgeous.

37:39.676 --> 37:40.635
It's really pretty.

37:43.638 --> 37:50.353
<i>♪ ♪</i>

37:55.066 --> 37:57.027
- Jessica and Stephanie,
please come join us.

37:58.820 --> 38:01.489
Okay. Tell us about your bake.

38:01.531 --> 38:04.576
<i>- We made a apple cherry pie.</i>

38:04.617 --> 38:07.495
<i>We grew up berry picking
with our grandma.</i>

38:07.537 --> 38:09.205
And she taught us
how to make pie.

38:09.247 --> 38:11.958
So we thought we'd bring
a little bit of home to you.

38:12.000 --> 38:15.045
- And then we also made
a Ceylon cinnamon ice cream.

38:15.086 --> 38:16.463
<i>And then,
if you look at the crust,</i>

38:16.504 --> 38:18.173
you can see the Seattle skyline

38:18.214 --> 38:20.675
with the Space Needle
and the ocean.

38:20.717 --> 38:22.135
- I can see
the three-dimension,

38:22.177 --> 38:25.013
but I would have liked it
a little bit more pronounced.

38:25.055 --> 38:26.931
- Okay.
- The bake is uneven.

38:26.973 --> 38:30.018
Some of it looks
very, very, very well done.

38:30.060 --> 38:32.729
- Yes.
- And some of it is lighter.

38:32.771 --> 38:34.939
- It smells delicious.
- It does.

38:34.981 --> 38:36.358
- Oh, look how pretty.

38:39.569 --> 38:41.029
- Mother of Jesus.

38:41.071 --> 38:43.156
- This is delicious.
- Oh, good. I'm so glad.

38:43.198 --> 38:46.659
- This is everything.
This is sweet. And it's tart.

38:46.701 --> 38:48.286
- Mm-hmm.

38:48.328 --> 38:49.829
- You know, not too sweet.
You know, because sometimes--

38:49.871 --> 38:51.122
- Oh, my God.
- Right.

38:51.164 --> 38:53.083
- Your ice cream is delicious.

38:53.124 --> 38:57.045
And the caramel sauce
just brings it all together.

38:57.087 --> 38:59.214
- Oh, good.
- I mean, this is lickin'.

39:00.924 --> 39:02.217
- I--I can't stop eating it.

39:02.258 --> 39:04.052
- I like the texture
of the apples too.

39:04.094 --> 39:05.887
I mean, in addition
to all the other stuff.

39:05.929 --> 39:07.681
And even though the crust
isn't consistent,

39:07.722 --> 39:08.932
you know, all the same color.

39:08.973 --> 39:10.266
I like it anyway.

39:12.310 --> 39:13.478
It's really good.

39:15.730 --> 39:18.400
- You doing okay
over there, Maya?

39:18.441 --> 39:21.778
- Maya, are you having
a moment? Are you okay?

39:21.820 --> 39:24.572
- I'm really happy.

39:24.614 --> 39:26.616
<i>- Niyati and Abhi.</i>

39:26.658 --> 39:29.452
<i>- It looks beautiful.
I love the leaves.</i>

39:29.494 --> 39:31.913
- For our pie challenge,
we decided to make

39:31.955 --> 39:35.083
the quintessential
chicken tikka masala pie.

39:35.125 --> 39:37.627
- It's beautiful.
I see the three-dimension.

39:37.669 --> 39:40.964
The creativity is excellent.

39:41.006 --> 39:42.424
So when I bite into this,

39:42.465 --> 39:44.634
it should be
a flavor bomb, right?

39:44.676 --> 39:46.302
- Yes.
- Wow.

39:46.344 --> 39:50.432
- The flavor is scrumptious.
- Oh, my God. It's delicious.

39:50.473 --> 39:51.516
Thank you.

39:51.558 --> 39:53.435
- Sauce complements
your pie filling.

39:53.476 --> 39:55.770
Your crust is very flaky.

39:55.812 --> 39:59.441
- Your spices
are incredible to me.

39:59.482 --> 40:01.609
- Balance is amazing.

40:01.651 --> 40:04.487
You don't just get one flavor,

40:04.529 --> 40:06.823
but you get everything

40:06.865 --> 40:08.992
at the same time
exploding in your mouth.

40:09.034 --> 40:11.953
- I'ma tell you right now.
This is, like, the best

40:11.995 --> 40:14.080
tikka masala
that I've ever had.

40:14.122 --> 40:15.623
You can make this
for me any holiday.

40:15.665 --> 40:17.000
Thank you.

40:17.042 --> 40:18.335
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you so much.

40:18.376 --> 40:19.961
- It means a lot, thank you.
- Thank you so much.

40:20.003 --> 40:21.421
- Jonah and Patrick.

40:21.463 --> 40:23.298
- So ours is with
the little piggy there.

40:23.340 --> 40:25.425
And so I've done
a pork and apple.

40:25.467 --> 40:30.055
<i>The inside is pork shoulder,
apple cider, sage,</i>

40:30.096 --> 40:32.307
<i>onion, and celery.</i>

40:32.349 --> 40:34.476
And it's also served
as sort of a potpie.

40:34.517 --> 40:37.979
- Is the little piggy edible?
- The piggy is not edible.

40:38.021 --> 40:39.147
- Sherri, we can make a call

40:39.189 --> 40:41.358
and get you
a fondant pig like that.

40:41.399 --> 40:44.027
- It is adorable.
- Thank you.

40:44.069 --> 40:45.987
- It's very festive
for the holidays.

40:46.029 --> 40:48.114
The green and the red.

40:48.156 --> 40:49.366
And I love that little sweet
tartness

40:49.407 --> 40:51.910
of the Granny Smith apple.
- Yes.

40:51.951 --> 40:54.996
- The pork is very,
very tender.

40:55.038 --> 40:56.206
- Your vegetables
are beautiful.

40:56.247 --> 40:57.665
- Yes.
- Thank you.

40:57.707 --> 40:59.084
- For me, pork and apples

40:59.125 --> 41:01.002
is one of my favorite
combinations.

41:01.044 --> 41:03.338
When I do pork and apples,

41:03.380 --> 41:05.006
I always add
apple cider vinegar.

41:05.048 --> 41:06.633
- Mmm. I thought about that.

41:06.675 --> 41:09.719
- Because the apple cider
vinegar takes the apple flavor

41:09.761 --> 41:11.096
up a couple of notches

41:11.137 --> 41:14.182
and it gives you
a real true apple flavor.

41:14.224 --> 41:15.767
This is very good,
but I'm not getting apple.

41:15.809 --> 41:17.102
- Got it.

41:17.143 --> 41:18.687
- I would love to have
tasted more apple.

41:18.728 --> 41:21.690
- A little bit more sage 'cause
sage is one of those herbs

41:21.731 --> 41:23.608
that reminds you
of the holidays.

41:23.650 --> 41:24.943
- Thank you for your notes.

41:24.984 --> 41:26.486
- I think these grannies
are getting tough.

41:26.528 --> 41:28.905
- You can see them
hardening their resolve.

41:28.947 --> 41:30.198
- Mmm.

41:30.240 --> 41:31.991
<i>- Getting ready
to drop the hammer.</i>

41:32.033 --> 41:35.328
- Ooh. I'm afraid.

41:42.127 --> 41:45.046
- Tom and Steve,
tell us about your bake.

41:45.088 --> 41:47.674
- What we have for you today
is a lobster pie.

41:47.716 --> 41:50.385
- It is beautiful.

41:50.427 --> 41:52.762
- And in the middle--
- That's a lobster claw.

41:52.804 --> 41:54.055
- A little lobster claw.

41:54.097 --> 41:55.932
- And it's resting on
a buttered panko crumb.

41:55.974 --> 41:57.308
- Thank you.

41:57.350 --> 41:59.144
- For the top,
something a little peppery

41:59.185 --> 42:00.311
because we know
you all love that.

42:00.353 --> 42:01.563
- So good. So good.
- Thank you.

42:01.604 --> 42:04.899
- You can tell,
the flavor is delicious.

42:04.941 --> 42:06.776
- And your sauce, whee!

42:06.818 --> 42:09.154
- The flavors are lovely,
I'll say that. Lovely.

42:09.195 --> 42:10.155
- Mmm. Believe it or not,

42:10.196 --> 42:11.489
I can't believe
I'm saying this,

42:11.531 --> 42:13.366
but it's a smidgen
too salty for me.

42:13.408 --> 42:14.784
But that doesn't mean
I'm not loving it.

42:14.826 --> 42:18.204
- The lobster, I wish it had
more lobster in it.

42:18.246 --> 42:21.666
But that piecrust,
it's golden brown.

42:21.708 --> 42:23.918
- Yes.
- And this is such a large pie.

42:23.960 --> 42:27.172
So that is some skill.
That is something else.

42:27.213 --> 42:28.214
- It was awesome.
- Thank you all.

42:28.256 --> 42:29.632
- Thank you.
- Appreciate it.

42:29.674 --> 42:31.301
- A labor of love.

42:33.386 --> 42:35.680
- Bakers, today, we got to see
how you work

42:35.722 --> 42:39.184
with unexpected ingredients in
our Short and Sweet Challenge.

42:39.225 --> 42:43.646
- And then you all made
some seriously hot pies.

42:43.688 --> 42:45.774
And I'm not
just talking temperature.

42:45.815 --> 42:48.234
- She's talking sex appeal,
which is a natural segue

42:48.276 --> 42:50.987
back to our judges.
Gigi Sherri,

42:51.029 --> 42:54.783
did any of these pies
get you hot and cobblered?

42:54.824 --> 42:57.494
- Oh, yeah.

42:57.535 --> 43:01.456
Bakers, there is nothing
more special to me

43:01.498 --> 43:05.669
than going to a fair
and handing out a blue ribbon

43:05.710 --> 43:10.215
for that big, old,
delicious pie.

43:10.256 --> 43:13.301
There is one team
that baked their way

43:13.343 --> 43:17.263
to the top in this cabin.
And that team is...

43:22.769 --> 43:24.354
Niyati and Abhi.

43:24.396 --> 43:26.189
<i>- * Hallelujah! Hallelujah! ♪</i>

and the tastiness,
and that bake

43:42.789 --> 43:47.252
is just a few of the reasons
why your pie rose to the top.

43:47.293 --> 43:48.878
So congratulations.
- Thank you.

43:48.920 --> 43:52.424
- Come and get your brooch.
You're going to the finals.

43:52.465 --> 43:56.261
- Yes.

43:56.302 --> 43:57.429
- Okay.
- Thank you so much.

43:57.470 --> 43:59.597
- You're welcome.
- And congratulations.

43:59.639 --> 44:01.099
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

44:01.141 --> 44:04.728
- Whoo-hoo!
- Whoo-hoo! Back to back.

44:04.769 --> 44:06.479
- I know!
It's like unbelievable.

44:06.521 --> 44:08.148
<i>- And in the finals.</i>

44:08.189 --> 44:12.402
Thanks for being there with me
on my side on this journey.

44:12.444 --> 44:13.570
- I wouldn't have thought

44:13.611 --> 44:16.114
anybody else
beside me other than you.

44:16.156 --> 44:17.365
- Yeah.
- So.

44:17.407 --> 44:19.743
- Welcome to the finals.

44:20.160 --> 44:21.494
- Yeah!
- Thank you.

44:21.536 --> 44:22.871
- Good job, you guys.
- Good job, you guys.

44:22.912 --> 44:24.622
- Congratulations.

44:25.790 --> 44:27.000
- Good job.

44:27.042 --> 44:29.127
- This moment gets sadder
and sadder each time

44:29.169 --> 44:30.295
we have to do it.

44:30.337 --> 44:32.464
- You all made it
to the semifinals,

44:32.505 --> 44:35.550
which means you already
have so much to be proud of.

44:35.592 --> 44:39.304
- It has been our pleasure
getting to know you all

44:39.346 --> 44:42.349
and seeing
the amazing things you can do.

44:42.390 --> 44:45.268
- But one team has to go home.

44:45.310 --> 44:46.811
And like always,

44:46.853 --> 44:50.523
we're gonna hand things
over to the adults in the room.

44:50.565 --> 44:53.735
- This was an almost
impossible decision to make.

44:53.777 --> 44:56.654
We've watched y'all grow
through all of these,

44:56.696 --> 44:58.990
but it comes time
that somebody's got to go home.

44:59.032 --> 45:01.493
And that team is...

45:04.454 --> 45:07.332

45:07.374 --> 45:09.000
Jonah and Patrick.

45:09.042 --> 45:11.503
- Aw!

45:13.296 --> 45:15.298
- Look at me sniffling.
- I know. I know.

45:15.340 --> 45:16.549
- Don't start.
I'll start crying.

45:16.591 --> 45:18.051
- Okay. All right, all right,
all right.

45:18.093 --> 45:20.095
Y'all are gonna make
a big difference in lives.

45:20.136 --> 45:21.304
I really mean that.

45:21.346 --> 45:22.722
I mean, you all
are marvelous men.

45:22.764 --> 45:26.017
Your presentation was
lovely and sweet, like y'all.

45:26.059 --> 45:29.437
But we thought it was lacking
in a little bit of flavor.

45:29.479 --> 45:31.272
We couldn't really taste
the flavor of the apples

45:31.314 --> 45:32.691
like we would have liked.

45:32.732 --> 45:34.943
So for those reasons,
we had to choose you all.

45:34.984 --> 45:37.696
But you can't leave this cabin
without a hug

45:37.737 --> 45:40.657
from Grandma Anne, so come on,
let me give it to you.

45:40.699 --> 45:43.493
Oh, I'm already tearing up now.

45:43.535 --> 45:45.161
Jonah, everybody
has tears here.

45:45.203 --> 45:47.205
So what is that saying
about y'all?

45:47.622 --> 45:51.835
- Control yourself.
- Thank you. Good job.

45:51.876 --> 45:53.795
- Thank you so much.
- It's bittersweet

45:53.837 --> 45:56.506
to get the cut
right before the finals.

45:56.548 --> 46:00.844
And I am still so proud
of what we accomplished.

46:00.885 --> 46:01.845
- I am too.

46:01.886 --> 46:03.388
- Keep on bringing
that sunshine.

46:03.430 --> 46:04.764
<i>- And we're so excited
for our friends.</i>
