WEBVTT

00:01.109 --> 00:04.156
Alexis: First of all,
welcome to my office.

00:04.384 --> 00:06.385
Now I think we all know
that most VIP guests

00:06.486 --> 00:08.554
wouldn't be caught dead
at a motel like this,

00:08.655 --> 00:10.088
no offense.

00:10.190 --> 00:12.958
But I have been able to secure...

00:12.983 --> 00:15.370
a V-VIP guest.

00:15.395 --> 00:18.082
Well, I'd go out on a limb
and say all of our guests

00:18.107 --> 00:20.108
are very important, Alexis.

00:20.133 --> 00:21.619
That's cute.

00:21.644 --> 00:24.979
Anyway, Emir Kaplan is a very
influential travel blogger,

00:25.004 --> 00:26.438
so it is of the utmost importance

00:26.509 --> 00:29.360
that we all make him feel at home.

00:29.819 --> 00:33.054
Hmm. Well, if he's looking
for that homey feeling,

00:33.079 --> 00:34.912
I should just invite
him over for dinner.

00:34.937 --> 00:36.558
<i>Joce is making pot roast.</i>

00:36.583 --> 00:38.260
All he'd have to bring
is a couple of sides,

00:38.284 --> 00:39.551
a bottle of wine,

00:39.576 --> 00:41.875
and something nice for the house.
Nothing cheap.

00:41.900 --> 00:44.600
- "The Road Less Traveled?"
- It's a very famous blog.

00:44.624 --> 00:46.959
He writes all about
the best eats, stays,

00:46.984 --> 00:49.037
and attractions off the beaten path.

00:49.062 --> 00:50.439
- Well, I don't want to second
- guess

00:50.463 --> 00:52.207
your publicity skills here Alexis,

00:52.232 --> 00:53.472
but I don't think it would hurt

00:53.533 --> 00:55.067
to tilt the scales in our favour.

00:55.168 --> 00:57.521
When we wanted to impress
people at Rose Video,

00:57.546 --> 00:59.347
Okay.

00:59.372 --> 01:00.672
Coffee break.

01:00.697 --> 01:03.985
We'd sometimes hire actors
who would come in as plants,

01:04.010 --> 01:06.511
- pretending to be...
- Customers! Yes!

01:06.613 --> 01:10.100
Walk around, talk up whatever
they're paid to talk up.

01:10.125 --> 01:12.633
I know, I was once paid to talk up

01:12.658 --> 01:15.321
Heartblaster Energy Drink
at a Third Eye Blind concert.

01:15.384 --> 01:18.219
I'm pretty sure we don't
have the budget for actors.

01:18.320 --> 01:20.388
I mean, if you're looking
to pay some guy to lie

01:20.489 --> 01:22.156
about how great this motel is,

01:22.181 --> 01:23.982
I'm happy to step in.

01:24.007 --> 01:25.836
- Do we need Roland?
- Stevie!

01:26.013 --> 01:27.847
You can be the plant.

01:27.872 --> 01:30.340
You look like someone who
just wandered in off the road.

01:30.365 --> 01:31.566
Thanks.

01:31.667 --> 01:33.734
And Johnny can be our Manager.

01:33.759 --> 01:35.303
Okay, first of all, you've gotta stop

01:35.328 --> 01:36.628
with the Johnny business, okay?

01:36.653 --> 01:38.521
And secondly, I am the Manager.

01:38.578 --> 01:40.551
Okay, well, you should probably start

01:40.576 --> 01:43.444
getting into character,
then. Okay, thanks.

01:54.205 --> 01:56.166
Ray: Knock, knock, everybody decent?

01:56.191 --> 01:57.901
- Oh my God!
- Once again, Ray,

01:57.926 --> 01:59.694
saying "knock knock"
is not the same thing

01:59.719 --> 02:00.846
as actually knocking.

02:00.893 --> 02:02.471
I'm just making breakfast,
and I wanted to know

02:02.495 --> 02:04.055
if I should make extra for you two.

02:04.080 --> 02:05.339
- No, I think we're good.
- Yes...

02:05.516 --> 02:07.451
Great! Door open, or closed?

02:07.476 --> 02:08.743
Closed.

02:12.143 --> 02:15.743
Okay, I thought you were
gonna talk to him about this.

02:15.768 --> 02:18.134
I let very few people
see me before 9:00 AM.

02:18.159 --> 02:20.923
I did. The "knock knock"
is him taking the note.

02:20.948 --> 02:23.350
Well, you might want to
invest in a "lock lock" then.

02:23.375 --> 02:24.432
Mm.

02:24.457 --> 02:26.002
- Knock knock!
- Holy (Bleep)!

02:26.027 --> 02:29.032
I realized I don't have
eggs, but I do have pancake mix.

02:29.057 --> 02:30.691
How do we feel about that?

02:31.493 --> 02:32.760
Four, please.

02:32.785 --> 02:35.595
David, you're constantly
talking about how much you eat.

02:35.620 --> 02:37.740
But I've seen you walk from
the bedroom to the shower,

02:37.765 --> 02:39.532
and you look fine.

02:39.767 --> 02:41.301
Huh?

02:41.402 --> 02:43.437
Okay Ray, we... we might need a minute.

02:43.462 --> 02:45.730
Of course. Door open, or closed?

02:46.118 --> 02:47.752
Closed.

02:50.010 --> 02:51.345
Wow!

02:51.370 --> 02:53.237
Okay, this is not working anymore.

02:53.262 --> 02:56.364
I think it's time we
look for an apartment.

02:58.720 --> 03:01.431
Oh. Okay, I mean...

03:01.456 --> 03:03.190
if that's what you want.

03:03.215 --> 03:05.260
Well, I think it's more of
a need at this point, David.

03:05.360 --> 03:06.804
I've been thinking about it for a while.

03:06.828 --> 03:07.961
Oh.

03:07.986 --> 03:09.690
Ray: Gentlemen, you're gonna laugh,

03:09.715 --> 03:11.515
but I just remembered, we do have eggs.

03:11.540 --> 03:13.507
They're in the pantry,
next to the pancake mix,

03:13.532 --> 03:15.177
which means they've been
sitting out for days.

03:15.202 --> 03:16.669
Are we feeling lucky?

03:17.260 --> 03:19.048
Can I still have the pancakes?

03:19.073 --> 03:21.274
Yes!

03:21.299 --> 03:23.366
- Ray!
- Patrick?

03:23.730 --> 03:25.166
Door closed.

03:25.191 --> 03:27.158
Of course.

03:29.508 --> 03:31.509
And Zeljko says, you eat,

03:31.686 --> 03:33.720
you expire pleasured.

03:35.690 --> 03:37.831
You expire pleasured.

03:37.856 --> 03:39.256
Twyla: Okay.

03:39.761 --> 03:41.471
What are we talking about today?

03:41.496 --> 03:43.230
More Bosnia stories?

03:43.255 --> 03:45.123
Yep, she never seems
to run out of 'em.

03:45.165 --> 03:47.706
Twyla, do you think it might
be too much of an imposition

03:47.731 --> 03:50.233
to ask the chef to whip me up a kifla?

03:50.605 --> 03:53.507
- What's a kifla?
- Oh, how best to describe it.

03:53.532 --> 03:55.099
I don't think you need to.

03:55.893 --> 03:57.387
Hi, y'all!

03:57.412 --> 03:59.312
Oh, Ronnie, Moira,

03:59.337 --> 04:01.018
I see you've ordered
without me, makes sense,

04:01.043 --> 04:03.290
because I was seven minutes late!

04:03.315 --> 04:05.917
Well, we've yet to put in our
kifla order, if you're peckish.

04:05.942 --> 04:07.275
Oh, I can't stay.

04:07.323 --> 04:10.188
I actually might not be able
to make it to rehearsal today.

04:10.213 --> 04:11.578
Roland was supposed to watch the baby,

04:11.603 --> 04:14.087
but he's got tied up at the motel, so...

04:14.112 --> 04:16.147
Oh Jocelyn, if you
can't make it rehearsal,

04:16.172 --> 04:17.946
no one's gonna hold that against you.

04:17.971 --> 04:19.493
Yeah, the baby comes first.

04:19.517 --> 04:21.228
Well, I just feel bad
because we really need

04:21.253 --> 04:23.005
to rehearse that Nine Inch Nails medley

04:23.030 --> 04:25.251
for our concert at "Yarn for Cheap."

04:25.276 --> 04:26.610
I'd be more than happy

04:26.635 --> 04:28.669
to spearhead that effort, Jocelyn.

04:28.713 --> 04:31.467
After collaborating so closely
with the director on "Crows,"

04:31.492 --> 04:33.626
I feel even more finely attuned

04:33.651 --> 04:36.520
to the fluctuations
of the human condition.

04:36.697 --> 04:39.032
Okay, it's just, I thought
that was sort of my...

04:39.057 --> 04:40.891
Even if you miss a
performance Jocelyn,

04:40.916 --> 04:42.717
there will be others!

04:42.742 --> 04:44.286
And don't worry about
your solo, Jocelyn.

04:44.311 --> 04:45.578
I know it by heart.

04:45.603 --> 04:47.941
I actually sing it quietly
every time you do it.

04:47.966 --> 04:50.501
I know, Twyla. And
it's not that quiet.

04:50.602 --> 04:53.704
Anyways, I guess I get
to sit this one out.

04:55.106 --> 04:56.840
Aw, it looks like somebody's up.

04:56.865 --> 04:58.399
No rest for the wicked.

04:58.424 --> 05:01.126
Well, these days, either
he's crying, or I am.

05:01.151 --> 05:03.723
Okay...

05:03.748 --> 05:05.883
See you l-l-later.

05:05.908 --> 05:07.742
- Bye!
- Bye!

05:07.767 --> 05:10.769
I'll get the door!
I'm-I'm sorry, excuse me.

05:11.350 --> 05:12.817
Okay.

05:13.260 --> 05:15.592
Johnny: Welcome to the
Rosebud Motel, Mr. Kaplan.

05:15.693 --> 05:17.293
Johnny Rose, and it's
a pleasure to uh...

05:17.318 --> 05:18.785
Johnny is our Manager,

05:18.810 --> 05:20.770
so just let me know if
you need anything from him.

05:20.795 --> 05:24.705
And this is Roland, he is
our Guest Services Liaison.

05:25.635 --> 05:28.639
Yes, and it's actually
pronounced "lee-as-on."

05:28.740 --> 05:31.708
And my name is actually
pronounced "Ro-lahnd."

05:31.885 --> 05:34.020
And if there's anything
you need, please tell me.

05:34.045 --> 05:36.446
Room service, turn-down
service, valet service...

05:36.548 --> 05:38.682
Okay Ro lahnd, those are a few items

05:38.783 --> 05:40.384
that might be tricky to pull off,

05:40.485 --> 05:42.619
but we do have coffee and
pastries every morning.

05:42.644 --> 05:44.330
Oh, great, that uh,

05:44.355 --> 05:46.033
that should beat the black
mold I had for breakfast

05:46.057 --> 05:47.491
at my last motel.

05:51.596 --> 05:55.632
Ro-lahnd, why don't you show Mr.
Kaplan to his room?

05:55.733 --> 05:57.601
Oh yes, formidab-Le.

05:57.702 --> 06:00.637
If you would uh, how do you say,

06:00.662 --> 06:02.649
um, voulez-vous with me please.

06:02.674 --> 06:04.474
I'll show you to your room.

06:04.499 --> 06:07.672
Right this way, we have you
in our most deluxe suite.

06:07.728 --> 06:11.024
Suite number four is uh...

06:11.049 --> 06:14.494
Ah! Miss Felming... ton.

06:14.519 --> 06:16.219
Enjoying your stay?

06:16.869 --> 06:18.364
Yes.

06:18.389 --> 06:20.542
Okay, Ro-lahnd, Johnny,

06:20.567 --> 06:23.055
we should let our
guests continue chatting.

06:23.080 --> 06:24.962
Ro-lahnd, this way.

06:25.063 --> 06:26.496
Here you go.

06:26.598 --> 06:28.065
Thank you.

06:30.617 --> 06:33.518
I think you're really
gonna like it here.

06:33.543 --> 06:35.949
It's clean, and the service is good.

06:35.974 --> 06:37.007
Yeah.

06:37.428 --> 06:40.430
Anyway, I'm just
staying here as a guest.

06:41.713 --> 06:43.357
It's always good to know
who your neighbours are

06:43.381 --> 06:44.592
in a place like this, you know,

06:44.616 --> 06:46.316
it's kind of a roll
of the dice, but uh...

06:46.493 --> 06:48.461
you seem somewhat normal.

06:48.486 --> 06:50.654
- Thank you for saying that.
- Well.

06:50.755 --> 06:53.657
Everyone agreed that
I was the normal one

06:53.758 --> 06:55.859
in my cell-block at
the women's prison, so.

06:55.884 --> 06:57.737
Oh, wow. Which prison?

06:57.762 --> 06:59.496
Maybe you know my wife.

06:59.521 --> 07:01.489
I don't-I'm kidding.
I don't have a wife...

07:01.666 --> 07:03.600
- anymore.
- Oh, disappeared?

07:03.625 --> 07:05.192
I'll never stop looking.

07:05.447 --> 07:06.980
I'm Emir.

07:07.005 --> 07:10.350
- Stevie.
- Stevie, hi.

07:10.375 --> 07:12.409
Stevie, nice to meet you.

07:15.456 --> 07:18.915
Oh, David. We have a V-VIP
staying with us at the moment.

07:18.940 --> 07:20.936
So do you mind staying
at Patrick's tonight?

07:20.961 --> 07:22.762
Your vibe can be a bit intense.

07:22.787 --> 07:25.602
Um, excuse me? If
anything, I'm a selling point.

07:25.627 --> 07:27.251
And Patrick's is a no-go.

07:27.276 --> 07:30.337
If fact, he just texted me the address

07:30.362 --> 07:32.372
of a new apartment

07:32.397 --> 07:35.165
that we might be going
to see together later, so.

07:35.342 --> 07:37.043
Um, did I leave a Q-tip in,

07:37.068 --> 07:39.002
or did you just tell me
that you guys are getting

07:39.027 --> 07:40.656
an apartment together?

07:40.681 --> 07:42.048
Hey, we're just going to look.

07:42.073 --> 07:45.375
Yeah, and Adam Levine and
I just went for bubble tea.

07:45.552 --> 07:47.754
I'm feeling very apprehensive
about the whole thing,

07:47.779 --> 07:50.790
like, I never saw myself
living with someone.

07:50.891 --> 07:52.425
That makes total sense,

07:52.450 --> 07:54.028
considering how nobody
you dated ever expressed

07:54.052 --> 07:55.819
any interest in that.

07:55.927 --> 07:57.695
I'm pretty sure I
can think of someone.

07:57.789 --> 07:59.723
By the end of the day, so.

08:00.222 --> 08:02.857
David, I think this
could be good for you guys.

08:03.895 --> 08:05.829
And also I know you're thinking like,

08:06.006 --> 08:07.874
Alexis is becoming a major girl boss,

08:07.914 --> 08:10.048
and is she just saying
this so she can expand

08:10.073 --> 08:12.011
her home office when I move out?

08:12.036 --> 08:14.313
I actually wasn't
thinking that at all.

08:14.338 --> 08:15.806
Anyway, David,

08:16.513 --> 08:18.317
your boyfriend asked
you to move in with him.

08:18.748 --> 08:20.216
You do it.

08:21.021 --> 08:22.455
I know.

08:23.263 --> 08:24.902
Also, do you have like, a time-frame

08:24.927 --> 08:26.594
as to when that might happen?

08:27.385 --> 08:29.319
No, I don't.

08:29.936 --> 08:32.171
<i>Jazzagals: Yes! Yeah!</i>

08:32.866 --> 08:34.967
Oh my God, so moody.

08:35.366 --> 08:37.168
Love it! Now, Ronnie?

08:37.193 --> 08:38.538
The line has been changed to,

08:38.563 --> 08:40.429
"I want to kiss you like an animal."

08:40.607 --> 08:42.542
I'll remember it on the day.

08:42.567 --> 08:45.535
I say we wrap things up on a high.

08:45.712 --> 08:48.381
Ladies, scour your
closets for black leather.

08:48.482 --> 08:50.316
Pleather accepted.

08:52.043 --> 08:54.311
I'm here!

08:54.412 --> 08:55.679
I've got a sitter!

08:55.704 --> 08:58.825
Oh Jocelyn, I'm afraid
that dirigible has ascended.

08:59.381 --> 09:00.727
But I'm here on time.

09:00.752 --> 09:02.805
Yes you are, but we
started an hour early.

09:02.830 --> 09:04.530
Ronnie has a massage.

09:04.631 --> 09:07.266
You moved the rehearsal
for Ronnie's massage?

09:07.291 --> 09:09.551
Well, it was also
conducive to Twyla's schedule.

09:09.576 --> 09:12.020
It's hard for her to
juggle, what with the cafe.

09:12.045 --> 09:14.674
Oh, is it hard for her? To juggle?

09:14.775 --> 09:16.542
And none of you here thought to tell me

09:16.567 --> 09:18.235
about this little time change?

09:18.260 --> 09:21.207
You said you couldn't
make it because of the bebe.

09:21.232 --> 09:23.270
We could start rehearsal over.

09:23.295 --> 09:25.030
Ohhh no!

09:25.207 --> 09:27.975
Don't make any changes on my account,

09:28.000 --> 09:29.801
I mean, you've gotta get to the cafe,

09:29.826 --> 09:31.794
and Ronnie's gotta have a massage!

09:31.971 --> 09:33.571
I have sciatica.

09:33.596 --> 09:35.998
I ran all over town
looking for a babysitter!

09:36.023 --> 09:36.974
Oh...

09:36.999 --> 09:39.099
Pulled a number off a telephone pole.

09:39.124 --> 09:41.622
She's a pet sitter, but she
said she'd make an exception.

09:41.723 --> 09:44.091
I don't even know her last name!

09:44.116 --> 09:46.684
Jocelyn, that sounds dangersome.

09:46.709 --> 09:48.876
I didn't wanna miss this rehearsal!

09:49.131 --> 09:51.899
But do any of you care? Apparently not!

09:52.000 --> 09:55.269
Because all of you have been acting...

09:55.370 --> 09:57.304
like bunch of...

09:57.329 --> 09:58.763
b-words!

10:03.521 --> 10:05.603
Okay. Evidently,

10:05.704 --> 10:07.772
one or two of you have
gotten under her skin.

10:09.526 --> 10:11.327
I'll handle it.

10:12.748 --> 10:15.680
Hey, Johnny?

10:15.789 --> 10:17.690
Our VIP is still in his room,

10:17.715 --> 10:19.793
so we should probably hold
off on the turn-down service.

10:19.885 --> 10:21.219
What turn-down service?

10:21.320 --> 10:23.198
Oh, that's just a little
something I've initiated

10:23.222 --> 10:25.690
now that I'm Guest Services Manager.

10:25.791 --> 10:27.525
I thought you were a liaison.

10:27.702 --> 10:29.303
No, I gave myself a promotion.

10:29.404 --> 10:31.372
Hey Stevie, what's the intel?

10:31.967 --> 10:34.842
Uh... well, I had a nap,

10:34.867 --> 10:36.601
then a beer,

10:36.626 --> 10:38.160
and now I need $40.

10:38.493 --> 10:40.861
What are you doing,
buying a wedding dress?

10:41.386 --> 10:44.623
Uh, Emir would like me
to go to lunch with him.

10:44.648 --> 10:46.387
What? No!

10:46.412 --> 10:48.279
- You don't have to do that!
- Oh, jeez.

10:48.380 --> 10:50.248
It's fine, it's just lunch.

10:50.273 --> 10:52.793
No Stevie, this is going way too far.

10:52.818 --> 10:54.652
Um, what's going on?

10:54.677 --> 10:56.730
Oh, Johnny's forcing Stevie

10:56.755 --> 10:59.834
into a very uncomfortable
situation with a strange man.

10:59.859 --> 11:01.226
Ugh. Okay fine, I'll tap in.

11:01.251 --> 11:02.951
Who are we talking about?

11:02.976 --> 11:05.877
Emir, and I'm fine to go.

11:06.132 --> 11:08.032
Stevie, I would go in
your place, it's just,

11:08.210 --> 11:10.611
my afternoon is gonna be kinda crazy

11:10.636 --> 11:13.004
- with all the turndowns.
- No, I want to go!

11:13.105 --> 11:15.425
So can I just have the $50?

11:15.450 --> 11:17.284
I thought it was $40.

11:17.309 --> 11:19.144
I also need shampoo.

11:25.756 --> 11:27.356
Body lice, you know, from the sheets,

11:27.381 --> 11:28.901
that'll get you a bad review.

11:28.926 --> 11:30.420
I've-I've contracted it a
few times, it's not pretty.

11:30.445 --> 11:32.818
Wow, what I love
about this conversation

11:32.897 --> 11:34.631
is how well it goes with lunch.

11:34.656 --> 11:36.799
Yeah, okay, this is not my A-material.

11:37.175 --> 11:39.354
But then again, I don't
normally ask women out

11:39.379 --> 11:41.046
when I'm on the job.

11:41.071 --> 11:43.258
Okay, you're telling me

11:43.283 --> 11:44.917
that you review motels for a living,

11:44.942 --> 11:46.943
and you've never met anyone?

11:47.044 --> 11:48.911
Okay, this may shock you, but uh...

11:50.506 --> 11:52.357
a lot of the people
that you meet in motels

11:52.382 --> 11:54.283
are not exactly like...

11:54.384 --> 11:56.285
Not like what?

11:56.904 --> 11:58.030
Well, they're not like you.

11:58.055 --> 11:59.255
Oh, yeah.

11:59.356 --> 12:00.590
Smart, charming,

12:00.691 --> 12:02.024
dazzling sense of humor,

12:02.049 --> 12:03.717
I was gonna say modest, but...

12:06.547 --> 12:07.981
So what brings you to town?

12:08.748 --> 12:10.766
Uh, just driving...

12:10.944 --> 12:12.878
to meet my sister...

12:12.903 --> 12:14.837
in Florida.

12:16.417 --> 12:19.506
Anyway, what about you?

12:19.943 --> 12:22.754
- Do you like what you do?
- I do, for the most part.

12:22.779 --> 12:24.299
You know, I like to keep a low profile

12:24.324 --> 12:25.591
when I'm on the road.

12:25.616 --> 12:27.259
I find if people know
that I'm coming in advance,

12:27.284 --> 12:28.985
they tend to put on a big show,

12:29.010 --> 12:31.178
and I never know what's genuine, so.

12:31.659 --> 12:34.027
Yeah, that must be tough.

12:34.917 --> 12:37.552
Okay, I don't even know
where to start with this menu.

12:37.794 --> 12:39.662
I'm a plant.

12:39.763 --> 12:41.264
I'm sorry?

12:41.440 --> 12:43.184
You were talking about
never knowing what's genuine,

12:43.209 --> 12:44.910
and uh...

12:44.935 --> 12:46.936
I can't keep this up.

12:47.037 --> 12:50.048
I work at the motel,

12:50.073 --> 12:53.332
and my coworkers thought
it would be a good idea

12:53.357 --> 12:56.030
for me to like, talk up the motel.

12:56.055 --> 13:00.192
Uh, but the more we
talked, the worse I felt.

13:04.540 --> 13:07.642
So you cracked before
we even ordered drinks?

13:08.560 --> 13:11.861
Yeah. It turns out
I'm really bad at this.

13:12.038 --> 13:14.139
Ah.

13:14.240 --> 13:16.875
Anyway, I'll leave you to lunch.

13:17.119 --> 13:19.354
Wait, wait, whoa, whoa, hang...
hang on a second.

13:21.271 --> 13:22.991
Okay, look, the problem is,

13:23.016 --> 13:24.850
I eat most of my meals by myself.

13:24.875 --> 13:27.243
So when there's a beautiful
woman sitting across from me,

13:27.268 --> 13:29.603
even if she is a con artist,

13:29.693 --> 13:31.227
I welcome the company.

13:31.821 --> 13:33.655
Please.

13:37.049 --> 13:38.449
Okay.

13:41.224 --> 13:43.069
Moira: Gals, let's welcome
our dear friend Jocelyn

13:43.093 --> 13:44.860
back into the circle.

13:44.885 --> 13:46.752
Oh, should we be in a circle?

13:48.174 --> 13:49.875
It's not top secret,

13:49.900 --> 13:52.134
we all know Jocelyn has
trouble being honest.

13:52.235 --> 13:53.712
Do we all know that?

13:53.737 --> 13:56.543
Wrong word, okay. Authentic.

13:56.568 --> 13:58.307
I think I can take
it from here, Moira.

13:58.332 --> 13:59.799
All right, then.

13:59.977 --> 14:02.473
Gals, since the baby,

14:02.498 --> 14:04.080
things have just been really tough.

14:04.181 --> 14:06.034
That's good, that's
good, expand on that.

14:06.059 --> 14:08.126
Okay, and I feel like
sometimes that my voice

14:08.151 --> 14:10.872
isn't being heard in this group.

14:10.897 --> 14:12.264
Touch louder, Jocelyn.

14:12.289 --> 14:14.342
Just because I don't
ask for your help,

14:14.367 --> 14:16.001
doesn't mean that I don't need it!

14:16.026 --> 14:18.204
Just a little more specific,
we're all here to help you.

14:18.228 --> 14:20.062
Okay, okay, well, Ronnie.

14:20.857 --> 14:22.975
I know that you've been getting
a lot of massages lately,

14:23.000 --> 14:25.110
because they're supposed
to help with your bad back,

14:25.135 --> 14:26.921
and stabilize your mood,

14:26.946 --> 14:28.814
but I haven't noticed an improvement!

14:28.839 --> 14:31.240
And sometimes you sing too softly.

14:31.341 --> 14:32.842
Agree to disagree.

14:32.943 --> 14:34.977
- And Twyla...
- I'm sorry, I'll sing louder.

14:35.078 --> 14:36.911
Nope, you are singing too loud.

14:36.936 --> 14:38.390
Wonderful, let it out, Jocelyn.

14:38.415 --> 14:40.483
And Moira.

14:40.508 --> 14:41.733
Okay, we can stop it there for today.

14:41.758 --> 14:45.731
We are all sick and tired
of hearing about Bosnia.

14:45.756 --> 14:47.790
- Yep.
- It's Bosnia this,

14:47.815 --> 14:50.035
and "Crows" that, and Blajka...

14:50.060 --> 14:51.861
We're just grasping
at straws now, Jocelyn.

14:51.886 --> 14:53.705
But this has been a fruitful exercise,

14:53.730 --> 14:55.598
don't we all feel better?

14:56.035 --> 14:58.670
Look at Twyla, look how moved she is.

14:59.615 --> 15:01.049
Oh no, I'm fine.

15:04.841 --> 15:06.961
I've actually seen a
few photos of this place,

15:06.986 --> 15:08.086
it looks pretty good.

15:08.111 --> 15:09.831
Yeah, the facade
would indicate otherwise,

15:09.856 --> 15:11.912
- but I trust you on this.
- Oh.

15:12.892 --> 15:15.293
You know, when I moved here
and got a room with Ray,

15:15.318 --> 15:16.996
I didn't know how long
I was gonna be staying.

15:17.020 --> 15:19.288
- Mhmm...
- And now here we are.

15:19.465 --> 15:22.334
For me this is bittersweet
because on the one hand,

15:22.359 --> 15:24.357
I could lose you as a roommate, Patrick,

15:24.382 --> 15:26.865
but on the other, I
would gain the commission.

15:30.572 --> 15:33.507
As you can see, this is open concept.

15:34.046 --> 15:36.181
Oh wow. It's good, eh, David?

15:36.555 --> 15:38.656
I thought this was the penthouse.

15:38.681 --> 15:42.250
Uh, it is the top
floor of three floors.

15:43.222 --> 15:44.756
- You said this was a one
- bedroom.

15:44.781 --> 15:48.651
It is, in the sense that it's
a one - bed - room.

15:48.752 --> 15:50.905
Any more beds, and you'd be in trouble.

15:50.930 --> 15:53.698
- Although bunk beds can be fun.
- Fireplace?

15:53.723 --> 15:56.878
Yeah, which I'm sure would
heat the room quite quickly,

15:56.903 --> 15:58.837
considering it's just one big...

15:58.938 --> 16:00.639
open space.

16:00.664 --> 16:02.231
I like the exposed brick.

16:02.889 --> 16:04.609
It's actually a pretty decent size.

16:05.029 --> 16:07.411
Yeah. Speaking of size,

16:07.436 --> 16:08.938
Ray, I've yet to see a closet.

16:08.963 --> 16:12.062
Is there a... is there a
walk-in that I'm missing?

16:12.087 --> 16:14.522
Oh, the closet is right over here.

16:16.046 --> 16:18.747
This is what small-space
realtors refer to as,

16:18.772 --> 16:20.759
a "step-in" closet.

16:20.784 --> 16:22.685
What do you think, David?

16:23.106 --> 16:26.584
- It's pretty perfect, huh?
- Yeah, it's pretty.

16:27.357 --> 16:28.691
Y-yeah.

16:28.792 --> 16:31.961
♪

16:32.062 --> 16:34.130
Not to jeopardize
our review any further,

16:34.231 --> 16:36.532
but would you mind not blowing my cover?

16:36.633 --> 16:37.900
Don't worry, I got it.

16:38.077 --> 16:40.812
Look who's back in da house!

16:41.334 --> 16:43.648
Johnny: Safe and sound, Ms. Felmington.

16:43.673 --> 16:45.960
Feeling okay about everything?

16:45.985 --> 16:47.886
That's a weird thing to say,

16:47.911 --> 16:50.331
but yes, I am.

16:50.356 --> 16:51.990
I turned down your bed for you,

16:52.015 --> 16:53.935
but I didn't have any chocolates,

16:53.960 --> 16:56.795
so I left a doggie bag of
pot roast on your pillow.

16:56.820 --> 16:58.754
Oh. Well, that's uh...

16:58.931 --> 17:00.832
unnecessarily generous
of you, Ro-lahnd.

17:01.412 --> 17:03.934
You know, I did have a
couple of requests, actually.

17:03.959 --> 17:04.993
Yes, of course.

17:05.095 --> 17:06.939
I was wondering if Ro-lahnd could make a reservation

17:06.963 --> 17:09.349
at the cafe tonight for
Ms. Felmington and I?

17:09.375 --> 17:10.653
Uh... hm!

17:10.678 --> 17:14.003
- Do we have sign
- off from Ms. Felmington?

17:14.029 --> 17:16.492
- We do.
- Emir: Great.

17:16.594 --> 17:18.361
One more thing, you
mentioned room service,

17:18.386 --> 17:20.063
I would love an English
breakfast tea to the room,

17:20.087 --> 17:21.820
and maybe one for Ms. Felmington.

17:21.922 --> 17:23.455
Oh, absolutely.

17:23.481 --> 17:25.434
Johnny, Emir would like some tea,

17:25.459 --> 17:27.060
and so would Ms. Felmington.

17:27.085 --> 17:29.086
Yes, and I'll show you
where you can find that...

17:29.263 --> 17:30.830
Ro-lahnd.

17:31.282 --> 17:33.584
Mrs. Felmington, may I
speak with you for a minute?

17:33.873 --> 17:36.141
I'm really tired, can this wait?

17:37.180 --> 17:38.347
Mhmm.

17:38.372 --> 17:40.473
Thanks.

17:40.574 --> 17:42.776
Hm.

17:42.877 --> 17:45.263
So, dinner tonight?

17:45.288 --> 17:47.456
Yeah, yeah, if it's
all right with you,

17:47.481 --> 17:48.959
I-I wouldn't mind
getting to know the real

17:48.983 --> 17:50.950
Ms. Felmington a little more.

17:51.207 --> 17:53.475
It is all right with me.

17:54.881 --> 17:56.465
Although it is a little unethical,

17:56.490 --> 17:57.590
just between you and I,

17:57.691 --> 17:59.259
so why don't I go write this review,

17:59.360 --> 18:01.060
and then I won't have
to feel guilty later?

18:01.162 --> 18:02.462
- Okay.
- Okay? All right.

18:02.563 --> 18:04.864
- After you.
- Oh! Oh! That's...

18:05.041 --> 18:06.175
not my room.

18:06.200 --> 18:08.201
Right, yeah, sorry. I didn't mean to.

18:10.646 --> 18:12.257
I mean, I know it's
like the first place

18:12.282 --> 18:13.482
that we've looked at, but...

18:13.583 --> 18:16.118
there's just something
very homey about it to me.

18:16.220 --> 18:18.421
Yeah, a sentiment shared by inmates,

18:18.446 --> 18:20.180
after their first couple years in jail.

18:20.898 --> 18:22.832
Okay, so you hate it.

18:23.284 --> 18:25.361
No. No.

18:25.386 --> 18:28.306
No, it's just if I've learned
anything from "House Hunters",

18:28.331 --> 18:30.266
you always to see the loft space,

18:30.291 --> 18:32.402
the charming English cottage,
and the renovated craftsman

18:32.426 --> 18:34.367
that you don't really wanna take,

18:34.392 --> 18:36.137
but the producers are gonna
force you to see anyway,

18:36.162 --> 18:38.037
before you make any major decisions.

18:38.248 --> 18:41.034
Gentlemen, I have one
more thing to show you.

18:41.211 --> 18:42.978
How are we still
on this (bleep) tour?!

18:43.003 --> 18:44.314
- Just...
- You'll thank me later,

18:44.338 --> 18:47.392
but uh, no more worrying
about door open, door closed.

18:47.417 --> 18:49.985
All you have to do
is open the curtain...

18:50.292 --> 18:54.195
to the bathroom!

18:55.492 --> 18:57.960
Ray, can we just have a moment?

18:57.985 --> 19:00.587
Absolutely. I'll just
wait in the bathroom.

19:02.649 --> 19:04.834
Curtain open, or curtain closed?

19:04.859 --> 19:06.069
- Oh, closed!
- Closed, I think.

19:06.093 --> 19:07.193
Mhmm.

19:08.229 --> 19:09.873
Don't worry, we'll be
putting a door on there.

19:09.897 --> 19:12.008
But I don't know if I wanna
put a door on the bathroom!

19:12.608 --> 19:14.234
I don't know if I love this place.

19:14.412 --> 19:15.845
And I'm not just saying that

19:15.870 --> 19:17.150
because the lack of closet space

19:17.238 --> 19:18.771
will inevitably force us to break up,

19:18.873 --> 19:20.306
I just sorta feel like...

19:20.483 --> 19:22.785
if we're going to be moving in together,

19:23.388 --> 19:26.922
we should both be totally on board.

19:27.829 --> 19:30.398
I totally understand, David.

19:30.961 --> 19:32.261
Good.

19:32.513 --> 19:34.981
It's just that I was
looking at this place like...

19:36.369 --> 19:38.370
just for me.

19:39.560 --> 19:41.327
Oh.

19:41.504 --> 19:43.105
Okay, it's just that you had said

19:43.130 --> 19:44.530
that we were going to see p-places.

19:44.598 --> 19:47.734
Right, yeah, so like,
more of a general "we".

19:47.835 --> 19:50.055
Because I knew that you'd be
staying over here quite a bit,

19:50.080 --> 19:52.214
and that you'd probably
have an opinion about it.

19:52.392 --> 19:55.094
Sure. Well then, you know,

19:55.119 --> 19:58.113
in that case, if this just for you,

19:58.138 --> 20:00.272
and occasionally me,

20:01.148 --> 20:02.483
I think it's cute.

20:03.932 --> 20:06.372
Wait, does this mean that you
were ready to move in with me?

20:07.354 --> 20:09.965
- No.
- No? Hmm.

20:09.990 --> 20:12.091
No, it's a closet
space, and a timing thing.

20:12.116 --> 20:13.784
- Uh
- huh. Yeah.

20:13.809 --> 20:17.983
So... you know, maybe we
can negotiate down the line...

20:18.675 --> 20:20.409
- at some point.
- Hmm.

20:20.809 --> 20:23.010
Ray: I can barely
hear your conversation.

20:24.280 --> 20:26.514
Are we sure we want the door?

20:27.942 --> 20:29.943
- Are you sure?
- Up to you.

20:36.505 --> 20:38.792
There's a little piece of
press you might wanna read.

20:38.817 --> 20:41.218
Oh, if I've died
again, I swear to God!

20:41.291 --> 20:44.794
- We are a "must-stay".
- What?!

20:46.350 --> 20:48.785
"The Rosebud Motel is a must-stay

20:48.810 --> 20:51.731
for any road-tripper,
or weary traveler.

20:51.756 --> 20:54.591
This charming, lovingly restored,

20:54.616 --> 20:57.469
roadside motel is a
welcome pit-stop for anyone

20:57.494 --> 21:00.663
looking for a clean room,
and first-rate hospitality."

21:00.764 --> 21:02.999
Compared to what, a haunted house?

21:03.100 --> 21:07.303
"In fact, Johnny Rose and
his Guest Services manager,

21:07.328 --> 21:10.030
will go almost too far out of their way

21:10.055 --> 21:12.241
to ensure a pleasant stay."

21:12.266 --> 21:14.981
How do I sign up for
this turn-down service?

21:15.006 --> 21:17.592
Is there a clipboard, or something?

21:20.076 --> 21:25.076
