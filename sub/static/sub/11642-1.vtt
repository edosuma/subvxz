Announcer:

00:22.273 --> 00:25.902
Alex: This is how I heard
about the boy, Kunta Kinte.

00:27.404 --> 00:30.532
And this is how
I'll tell you the story.

00:30.615 --> 00:33.618
[woman singing indistinctly]

00:37.288 --> 00:39.833
The two most important days
in a man's life

00:39.916 --> 00:42.043
are the day he is born

00:42.127 --> 00:45.046
- and the day that he understands why.
- [indistinct shouting]

00:45.130 --> 00:46.923
[man groans]

00:47.048 --> 00:48.883
[grunts]

00:50.593 --> 00:52.595
[screaming]

00:55.140 --> 00:56.391
[grunts]

00:56.474 --> 00:58.727
[exhales sharply]

00:58.810 --> 01:03.022
There was once a rich
and sophisticated city named Juffure

01:03.106 --> 01:06.234
in a Mandinka kingdom
in West Africa.

01:06.317 --> 01:09.279
It was located on the banks
of the Kamby Bolongo,

01:09.362 --> 01:12.574
the Great River of the Gambia.

01:12.657 --> 01:14.659
[music plays throughout]

01:18.872 --> 01:21.750
Like the Greeks, Romans and Hebrews,

01:21.833 --> 01:25.420
Mandinka kept slaves
as servants.

01:25.503 --> 01:28.757
Some slaves married
into these families,

01:28.840 --> 01:33.094
others paid ransoms to be free.

01:35.722 --> 01:39.684
Then Europeans arrived
in great sailing ships.

01:39.768 --> 01:43.271
Some Mandinka were corrupted
by European guns and gold,

01:43.354 --> 01:45.774
creating a violent market
for slaves.

01:46.775 --> 01:49.277
But the many Africans
who fought European plundering

01:49.360 --> 01:51.613
suffered brutal reprisals.

01:52.614 --> 01:56.993
Kunta Kinte's family were
warriors loyal to the king.

01:57.118 --> 01:58.398
On the day
that Kunta was born...

01:59.871 --> 02:01.831
...the Kinte family
had a violent clash

02:01.915 --> 02:04.101
- with their rivals, the Koros...
- [man shouts indistinctly]

02:04.125 --> 02:06.127
...who were loyal
only to their greed.

02:06.211 --> 02:08.003
[man shouting in Mandinka]

02:09.714 --> 02:10.965
[grunting]

02:15.553 --> 02:17.430
[groaning]

02:21.935 --> 02:23.937
It would take Kunta a long time

02:24.020 --> 02:26.272
to understand why he was
born into this world,

02:26.356 --> 02:28.107
but when he did,

02:28.191 --> 02:31.361
it was as clear as the sky
above the Kamby Bolongo.

02:46.835 --> 02:48.711
Permission?

02:48.795 --> 02:50.880
I do not need permission.

02:50.964 --> 02:54.551
The king needs my sons and I
to support him.

02:54.634 --> 02:56.553
The king knows you sail upriver

02:56.636 --> 02:58.638
to buy slaves
at favorable prices.

02:58.721 --> 03:01.516
He knows you're trading them
for English guns.

03:01.599 --> 03:04.936
None of this is your business,
Omoro Kinte.

03:05.019 --> 03:08.231
We control who goes up and down
the river.

03:08.314 --> 03:11.192
For our Mansa, the king.

03:12.443 --> 03:13.444
[grunts]

03:13.528 --> 03:14.904
Aah!

03:14.988 --> 03:16.906
[screams]

03:18.116 --> 03:21.578
Do not sacrifice your sons
for your own greed!

03:22.954 --> 03:25.206
[horse whinnies]

03:32.380 --> 03:34.007
[drum playing]

03:45.476 --> 03:47.270
[horse grunting]

03:53.818 --> 03:55.820
[screaming]

04:01.826 --> 04:04.287
[screams, grunts]

04:04.370 --> 04:05.955
Push, push.

04:09.250 --> 04:11.586
[breathing heavily]

04:11.669 --> 04:13.671
[indistinct conversations]

04:17.300 --> 04:19.677
- Push.
- Aah! Aah!

04:19.761 --> 04:21.053
Push! Push!

04:25.350 --> 04:27.352
[indistinct conversations]

04:31.189 --> 04:32.440
Turn.

04:32.523 --> 04:34.817
Go. Wait.

04:54.879 --> 04:57.382

[laughter]

05:17.402 --> 05:19.195
[singing continues]

05:20.196 --> 05:23.157
Now you can enter,
brave Mandinka warrior.

05:23.241 --> 05:24.701
[laughter]

05:54.939 --> 05:57.734
[humming]

06:08.619 --> 06:10.496
You must hear your name first.

06:12.623 --> 06:14.042
You are Kunta Kinte,

06:14.125 --> 06:18.212
son of Omoro and Binta Kinte.

06:18.296 --> 06:22.967
Grandson of Kairaba Kunta Kinte
and Yaisa.

06:24.635 --> 06:28.306
You must always
honor your ancestors,

06:28.389 --> 06:31.559
the ones who love you
and watch over you.

06:31.642 --> 06:35.188
Your name is your spirit.

06:35.271 --> 06:38.316
Your name is your shield.

06:40.943 --> 06:43.279
Allahu Akbar!

06:43.404 --> 06:45.364
Behold Kunta Kinte,

06:45.448 --> 06:49.744
the only thing
that is greater than you.

07:00.088 --> 07:02.090
[indistinct conversations]

07:06.677 --> 07:08.971
[laughs]

07:09.055 --> 07:11.057
[cheering]

07:13.893 --> 07:15.019
[laughs]

07:15.103 --> 07:17.605
I am king of the Kamby Bolongo!

07:17.688 --> 07:19.565
[laughs]

07:20.942 --> 07:21.943
[laughs]

07:22.026 --> 07:23.444
[gasps] Crocodile!

07:23.528 --> 07:25.822
Aah! Aah!

07:25.905 --> 07:28.074
[laughter]

07:30.576 --> 07:33.538
Kunta, don't run away.

07:33.621 --> 07:36.666
You are so sour,
a crocodile would spit you out.

07:36.749 --> 07:41.295
[chuckles] Jinna, come swim
down river with me.

07:41.379 --> 07:43.840
Then we will see
who's scared of crocodiles.

07:43.923 --> 07:45.466
Sitafa:
Back to work, Jinna.

07:45.550 --> 07:47.885
And I don't see many oysters
in your basket.

07:47.969 --> 07:50.346
Because they have disappeared
into your belly.

07:50.471 --> 07:52.140
[laughter]

07:52.223 --> 07:54.475
Kunta, don't bother
with that girl.

07:54.559 --> 07:57.019
Soon an older warrior
will take her for his bride.

07:57.103 --> 07:58.646
Jinna is getting married?

07:58.729 --> 08:00.523
One of the Koros.

08:00.606 --> 08:03.151
He agreed to bring her
into the family.

08:03.234 --> 08:06.279
Then she can bother the Koros
instead of you.

08:08.406 --> 08:10.491
[xylophone playing]

08:17.790 --> 08:19.792

[all cheering]

09:36.869 --> 09:39.038
Kunta!
[speaks native language]

09:44.043 --> 09:47.255
No, Kunta, this is not the time.
Control your temper.

09:47.338 --> 09:49.465
Anger is the path
to poor decisions.

09:54.845 --> 09:57.431
Lamin is hungry.

09:57.515 --> 09:59.767
Go to my room
and get a bowl of cooked rice.

09:59.850 --> 10:00.851
But he's sleeping.

10:00.935 --> 10:02.311
Is this back talk?

10:04.605 --> 10:06.607
[rhythmic clapping resumes]

10:13.030 --> 10:15.491
Cooked rice.

10:19.745 --> 10:22.248
- [sword clangs]
- [shouting]

10:23.332 --> 10:24.625
Make me proud.

10:25.876 --> 10:27.878
[Kunta panting]

10:29.714 --> 10:31.048
Aah!

10:44.770 --> 10:46.772
[panting]

10:54.905 --> 10:55.906
Aah.

10:57.575 --> 10:58.576
Man: Aah!

11:07.585 --> 11:08.836
Uncle Silla!

11:09.837 --> 11:12.214
- Did I ask you to speak?
- No, Uncle Silla.

11:12.298 --> 11:14.842
If I didn't ask you to speak,
why do you keep saying my name?

11:14.925 --> 11:16.260
I'm dying of thirst.

11:17.261 --> 11:18.888
Aah!
Is there water?!

11:18.971 --> 11:21.223
Kintago:
Of course there is water.

11:26.020 --> 11:29.523
If I had run as far as you,
I would want water, too.

11:29.607 --> 11:32.818
But what you want
is of no importance.

11:32.902 --> 11:34.653
I am your Kintago!

11:34.737 --> 11:36.322
All: Peace be with you.

11:36.405 --> 11:37.865
[speaks native language]

11:39.867 --> 11:41.660
And with you.

11:41.744 --> 11:45.873
May Allah's mercy
rain upon you.

11:45.956 --> 11:48.209
You will need it.

11:48.292 --> 11:52.213
Your lives will be measured
by what you do now.

11:52.296 --> 11:56.425
Only the bravest will be selected
to become warriors,

11:56.509 --> 11:58.761
to serve your king.

11:58.844 --> 12:01.055
But if you fail,

12:01.138 --> 12:03.599
no woman
will bear your children.

12:03.724 --> 12:05.726
You must leave Juffure

12:05.810 --> 12:08.479
and live your days
somewhere else.

12:08.562 --> 12:11.857
Now stand up!

12:11.941 --> 12:13.234
Line up!

12:13.317 --> 12:14.902
And shut up!

12:14.985 --> 12:18.447
Your jujuo is across the river.

12:18.531 --> 12:22.785
You will live there
like the old Mandinka way,

12:22.868 --> 12:24.620
in warm, comfy lean-tos.

12:24.745 --> 12:25.955
What are you waiting for?

12:26.038 --> 12:27.540
Now cross the river.

12:27.623 --> 12:28.999
Go!

12:29.083 --> 12:31.085
[whip cracks] [all shouting]

12:36.507 --> 12:39.176
- [all grunting]
- Go! Go!

13:27.808 --> 13:29.101
[horse whinnying]

13:34.315 --> 13:36.484
Kintago:
For a Mandinka warrior,

13:36.567 --> 13:40.529
one horse is worth
20 men in battle.

13:40.613 --> 13:43.199
I know you have been
taught to ride by your family,

13:43.282 --> 13:45.993
but not a horse like this.

13:46.076 --> 13:47.536
He is a king of a royal line

13:47.620 --> 13:49.997
that goes back
to the great kings of Mali.

13:50.080 --> 13:51.957
[horse whinnies]

13:53.083 --> 13:54.960
Who will ride him?

13:58.172 --> 14:00.007
Kunta volunteers.

14:02.426 --> 14:04.970
But I don't see a saddle
or reins.

14:05.054 --> 14:08.390
This horse will never allow a boy
like you to put a bit in his mouth.

14:08.474 --> 14:10.351
And what if your enemy
took your saddle?

14:10.434 --> 14:12.353
Would you try to run
without your horse?

14:12.436 --> 14:14.063
Silla:
Hands up together.

14:14.146 --> 14:15.856
But how will I hold on?

14:15.940 --> 14:18.067
- [whip cracks]
- Kintago: What are your legs for?

14:22.112 --> 14:24.156

14:32.122 --> 14:35.668
Ah! Slow! Wait, slow down!

14:35.751 --> 14:37.294
[panting]

14:38.963 --> 14:40.714
Go around. Go around.

14:42.091 --> 14:43.342

[horse snorting]

15:04.989 --> 15:06.865
[horse whinnies]

15:06.949 --> 15:12.246
This king of horses has made you
all look weak, unprepared.

15:12.329 --> 15:15.541
You have far to go if you want
to be called a Mandinka warrior.

15:15.624 --> 15:17.585
This horse could feel your fear

15:17.668 --> 15:20.087
because you are only
thinking of yourselves,

15:20.170 --> 15:22.256
not about the horse.

15:22.339 --> 15:24.341
[man singing

[all grunting]

15:47.323 --> 15:49.366
Kintago: Are we moving?

15:49.450 --> 15:51.952
Why do I still feel
we are on the riverbank?

15:52.036 --> 15:53.287
Faster.

15:54.872 --> 15:56.290
If we met an enemy,

15:56.373 --> 15:58.959
this would be a canoe
full of dead warriors.

15:59.043 --> 16:01.128
My hands are like monkey paws.

16:02.421 --> 16:04.965
Faster! Faster!
Paddle!

16:05.049 --> 16:07.092
[horn blowing]

16:07.176 --> 16:08.177
You hear that?

16:09.428 --> 16:11.305
The enemy approaches.

16:11.388 --> 16:13.474
We must stop the enemy
on the river,

16:13.557 --> 16:15.976
or he will kill you
and attack your families.

16:16.060 --> 16:19.521
This can't be real, is it?

16:19.605 --> 16:21.231
Your weapons are at your feet.

16:23.359 --> 16:24.860
But these are not sharpened.

16:24.985 --> 16:29.031
Oh. Did you all forget to prepare
your weapons in advance?

16:30.032 --> 16:33.952
There is a word for a Mandinka
who is unprepared in battle:

16:34.036 --> 16:35.371
A slave.

16:36.372 --> 16:37.665
I see them.

16:37.748 --> 16:40.376
It's only Master Silla.

16:40.459 --> 16:42.586
Addo, stand up.

16:42.670 --> 16:45.798
Use your javelin.

16:45.881 --> 16:48.634
Attack your enemy
before he kills you.

16:48.717 --> 16:50.219
What if I hit Master Silla?

16:50.302 --> 16:52.846
A warrior who hesitates
is a dead warrior.

16:52.930 --> 16:54.264
Throw now.

16:54.348 --> 16:55.933
[grunts]

17:03.023 --> 17:04.483
Aah!

17:07.569 --> 17:09.863
Kunta! Up!

17:09.946 --> 17:13.367
If you cannot fight your enemy
across the river, you will be killed!

17:13.450 --> 17:15.035
Taken as a slave!

17:19.080 --> 17:20.499
[Kunta grunts]

17:24.420 --> 17:25.671
[grunts]

17:30.342 --> 17:33.053
I will not tolerate
your insolence.

17:33.137 --> 17:35.264
You disobeyed my order.

17:35.347 --> 17:37.808
I instructed you
to use your javelin.

17:37.891 --> 17:40.811
Instead, you insulted
Silla Ba Dibba, your teacher.

17:40.894 --> 17:43.313
I defeated my enemy.

17:46.150 --> 17:50.571
Kunta Kinte, we will see if you are
as good as you think you are.

17:50.654 --> 17:53.115
You will be given a head start.

17:53.198 --> 17:55.909
If you make it back to our jujuo
before the others catch you,

17:55.993 --> 17:57.453
you can continue your training.

17:57.536 --> 18:00.038
But if you are caught,

18:00.122 --> 18:02.124
you will fail your training.

18:02.207 --> 18:04.251
You will never
become a warrior,

18:04.334 --> 18:06.795
and you will be banished.

18:06.879 --> 18:08.130
[shouts]

18:12.551 --> 18:16.597
Now run, Kunta Kinte.
Run!

18:23.896 --> 18:25.147
Go!

18:25.898 --> 18:27.900
[panting]

18:40.537 --> 18:42.206
[man speaks native language]

18:50.422 --> 18:52.424
[man speaks native language]

19:05.729 --> 19:07.356
[man shouting
in native language]

19:07.439 --> 19:09.900
[cow bellows]

19:12.402 --> 19:13.987
[laughs]

20:21.513 --> 20:23.223
You sure the dead man
was from Juffure?

20:23.307 --> 20:26.476
Yes, Uncle Silla.
I knew him.

20:27.936 --> 20:29.855
His name was Musa.

20:29.938 --> 20:33.609
His family trades
rice and oysters.

20:33.692 --> 20:36.236
His neck was tied like a goat.

20:36.320 --> 20:38.780
The Koros have gone too far.

20:38.864 --> 20:40.198
First they defy the king

20:40.282 --> 20:43.327
and sell slaves from upriver
without permission.

20:43.410 --> 20:47.539
Now they're taking our own
to sell for guns.

20:47.623 --> 20:51.627
Brother, it's too dangerous
to be this far from Juffure,

20:51.710 --> 20:53.420
especially for our sons.

20:53.503 --> 20:56.590
The Koros can take them as hostages
and hold them for ransom.

20:58.592 --> 21:00.385
We must fight them, Fa.

21:01.678 --> 21:03.889
It's far easier
to rush into fighting

21:03.972 --> 21:06.266
than to stop it once it starts.

21:12.856 --> 21:14.107
[shrieks]

21:14.191 --> 21:17.110
Kintago: He is asking you
a question.

21:17.194 --> 21:21.323
What is the warrior's
first responsibility?

21:21.406 --> 21:23.825
- To serve his king.
- [shrieks]

21:23.909 --> 21:26.912
- [men shout in native language]
- [shrieks]

21:26.995 --> 21:29.122
He says you are wrong.

21:29.206 --> 21:31.166
- To honor Allah.
- [shrieks]

21:31.291 --> 21:33.126
- [men shout in native language]
- [shrieks]

21:33.210 --> 21:35.011
- [men shout in native language]
- Also wrong.

21:35.087 --> 21:39.466
The first duty of a Mandinka warrior
is to raise a family,

21:39.549 --> 21:44.888
to have children,
to pass on our way of life.

21:44.972 --> 21:48.809
This starts with
a clean and healthy foto.

21:50.102 --> 21:51.979
What we're about to do to you

21:52.062 --> 21:54.481
has been done to your fathers

21:54.564 --> 21:57.484
and their fathers
and all of your forefathers.

21:57.567 --> 22:01.905
The paste will help numb you a little,
but not enough.

22:01.989 --> 22:05.575
The pain will help you
remember Kasa Boyo.

22:05.659 --> 22:10.038
And trust me,
you will remember it.

22:11.915 --> 22:13.709
Hold out your foto,

22:13.792 --> 22:15.669
Kunta Kinte!

22:20.549 --> 22:21.800
[screams]

22:32.436 --> 22:35.105
[howls]

22:35.188 --> 22:37.190
[villagers singing
in native language]

23:03.425 --> 23:04.676
Jinna.

23:06.678 --> 23:08.847
I missed your wedding.

23:09.598 --> 23:12.392
But I am not married, Kunta.

23:16.188 --> 23:17.731
[shrieks]

23:17.814 --> 23:19.107
[villagers cheer]

23:22.819 --> 23:27.032
[Binta singing in native language]

23:35.207 --> 23:36.625
Kunta.

23:38.877 --> 23:40.712
Rise up, mother.

23:42.172 --> 23:44.925
I'm sorry for coming
inside your new home

23:45.008 --> 23:48.095
without your permission,
Kunta Kinte.

23:48.178 --> 23:49.679
I'm happy to see you, mother.

23:50.680 --> 23:54.434
I made you a prayer rug,

23:54.518 --> 23:56.520
a bowl for rice, and...

23:58.730 --> 24:00.440
...and beads.

24:14.287 --> 24:16.039
The guests
will be arriving soon.

24:21.086 --> 24:23.088
[humming]

24:39.479 --> 24:42.566
[laughs]

24:45.360 --> 24:47.904
Omoro: Have you ever
seen his like?

24:47.988 --> 24:49.406
[horse whinnies]

24:50.615 --> 24:52.909
Now that you will serve
in the king's cavalry,

24:52.993 --> 24:56.079
your horse should be the best.

24:56.163 --> 25:00.167
His line traces back to
the great herds of the Sahara.

25:00.250 --> 25:02.127
[horse whinnies]

25:02.210 --> 25:04.754
If I accept this horse...

25:05.755 --> 25:07.841
must I stay in Juffure?

25:07.924 --> 25:10.177
I don't understand.

25:10.260 --> 25:12.637
Juffure is our home.

25:12.721 --> 25:14.389
Why would you leave?

25:14.514 --> 25:16.975
To study in Timbuktu.

25:17.809 --> 25:20.562
- Then we'd never see you again.
- Binta: That's true.

25:20.645 --> 25:23.732
It is very, very far, Kunta.

25:23.815 --> 25:27.068
I need to know if I can attend
university.

25:27.152 --> 25:30.405
Test myself against
the best students in the world.

25:30.530 --> 25:33.366
Timbuktu is a giant city,

25:33.450 --> 25:35.493
with aggressive
and ambitious people

25:35.577 --> 25:38.830
where boys fight like dogs
to be accepted in the university.

25:38.914 --> 25:40.790
It'll be my own fight.

25:40.874 --> 25:43.210
You would do this
to your mother?

25:43.293 --> 25:45.587
I won't allow it.

25:45.670 --> 25:47.255
Are you ordering me to stay?

25:47.339 --> 25:50.842
I want you to perform
your duties to this family,

25:50.926 --> 25:53.970
like I did, like my father did,

25:54.054 --> 25:57.515
and his father before him.

25:57.599 --> 26:01.061
I won't always be there to clean up
the trouble you cause, Kunta.

26:02.312 --> 26:05.941
Listen to your elders.

26:06.024 --> 26:07.400
Stay here.

26:07.484 --> 26:11.905
Stop filling your head
with dreams.

26:11.988 --> 26:13.782
And forget that girl.

26:14.866 --> 26:17.369
We will make you
a better match.

26:50.694 --> 26:54.823
Old Mandinka say this shall bring him
back to us in peace.

27:13.383 --> 27:16.219
- [horse neighs]
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

27:16.303 --> 27:17.804
You scared him.

27:17.887 --> 27:19.472
A wild-tempered horse.

27:20.515 --> 27:22.642
Perfect for you, Kunta.

27:24.269 --> 27:28.315
So, Kalabi Koro
chose someone else?

27:28.398 --> 27:31.151
I turned him down.

27:31.234 --> 27:33.320
But I know
the right warrior for me.

27:33.403 --> 27:36.239
If he even exists.

27:37.949 --> 27:40.702
Kunta: My parents want to arrange
a marriage for me.

27:40.785 --> 27:42.037
I turned them down, too.

27:42.120 --> 27:44.873
But I came to speak to you.

27:44.956 --> 27:46.875
There's nothing to talk about.

27:46.958 --> 27:51.171
Now they say you are going
to Timbuktu to study,

27:51.254 --> 27:53.840
far, far away,

27:53.923 --> 27:57.260
instead of serving the king
or taking a wife.

27:57.344 --> 27:59.971
Jinna.
Look, will you slow down?

28:02.432 --> 28:03.683
I agree.

28:05.101 --> 28:09.356
And you should only choose
the right warrior.

28:09.439 --> 28:11.733
Jinna, I'm the right warrior.

28:11.816 --> 28:13.568
You know this.

28:13.693 --> 28:15.403
We both do.

28:15.487 --> 28:19.199
Everyone in Juffure
tells me what I can't do, but...

28:19.282 --> 28:21.576
[sighs]

28:21.701 --> 28:23.703
...I know what I want.

28:27.123 --> 28:29.751
Lopes:
Peace be upon you, brother.

28:29.834 --> 28:31.544
And upon you.

28:31.628 --> 28:33.213
You look familiar.

28:34.381 --> 28:35.924
Yes.

28:36.007 --> 28:37.717
I think I have seen you.

28:37.801 --> 28:40.887
You are the boy of Omoro Kinte.

28:42.138 --> 28:45.141
You speak Mandinka,
but you're not one of us.

28:45.225 --> 28:47.435
I speak many languages.

28:47.519 --> 28:50.897
How else can a man make a living
here on the Kamby Bolongo?

28:50.980 --> 28:52.315
[horse grunts]

28:52.399 --> 28:56.403
Go home, girl, quickly,
or I will beat you.

28:58.113 --> 28:59.364
[chuckles]

28:59.447 --> 29:03.451
It's time your family pay for all the
trouble they have caused me, Kunta.

29:03.535 --> 29:04.953
Come peacefully.

29:05.036 --> 29:08.123
The ransom negotiations
should not take long,

29:08.206 --> 29:10.166
then you can go free.

29:10.250 --> 29:12.627
Go free?

29:12.752 --> 29:15.088
I am free.

29:15.171 --> 29:17.924
- Run! Tell my father!
- Shoot her!

29:22.137 --> 29:23.388

29:29.936 --> 29:30.979

How long must I endure your family?

30:42.217 --> 30:45.011
[both grunting]

30:50.975 --> 30:53.561
There will be no ransom.

30:53.645 --> 30:56.523
Sell the boy to the English
with the other captives.

30:56.606 --> 30:59.359
Take as many of his friends
as you can.

31:00.318 --> 31:04.781
I want Omoro Kinte
to feel what I feel.

31:04.864 --> 31:06.115
[whip cracks]

31:09.244 --> 31:11.246

Hove! Bring him forward!

31:11.329 --> 31:12.622
Drop him now!

31:12.705 --> 31:15.416
- [branding iron sizzling]
- [screams]

31:15.500 --> 31:16.793
Three crates of muskets.

31:16.876 --> 31:18.795
That's twice their worth.

31:18.878 --> 31:20.421
These men are warriors.

31:20.505 --> 31:22.298
Two crates. No more.

31:23.174 --> 31:25.385
Restrain him!

31:25.468 --> 31:27.929
Take him down, for God's sake.

[man speaks native language]

31:31.057 --> 31:32.559
Aah!

Hove! Bring him forward

31:37.647 --> 31:39.816
- Get him.
- [grunting]

31:39.899 --> 31:41.985

- Drop him down!

What is this noise?

32:51.971 --> 32:54.557
The ship is getting ready
to move.

32:58.978 --> 33:01.439
I cannot breathe.

33:01.522 --> 33:02.857
Why is there no air
in this hole?

33:02.982 --> 33:04.859
Are we under water?

[coughs]

33:06.611 --> 33:08.363
[exhales sharply]

33:08.446 --> 33:10.114
How long have we been here?

Do you speak Mandinka, father?

[man coughing]

33:32.011 --> 33:34.597
Uncle Silla...

33:34.681 --> 33:37.266
I soiled myself.

33:39.018 --> 33:40.770
Like an animal.

33:43.314 --> 33:44.774
I'm ashamed.

33:47.026 --> 33:49.821
The shame is not ours, Kunta.

[indistinct chattering]

34:01.165 --> 34:02.417
[groaning]

34:07.171 --> 34:08.464
They hurt you, Uncle Silla.

34:10.341 --> 34:14.429
Your voice comforts me.

34:14.512 --> 34:18.766
What if the Koros hurt my father
and my mother and my brothers?

34:18.850 --> 34:22.520
Uncle Silla,
how will my family find us?

[man singing

34:38.870 --> 34:40.455
Silla: Kunta.

34:40.538 --> 34:44.833
I think Allah sends us dreams
to guide us.

34:44.917 --> 34:47.837
Dream of seeing your family again.

34:47.920 --> 34:51.132
Will you do that for me, Kunta?

34:51.215 --> 34:53.092
Yes, Uncle Silla.

34:58.556 --> 35:00.141
Fa.

35:01.392 --> 35:02.810
Please find me.

35:02.894 --> 35:04.812
[man singing

35:05.521 --> 35:07.023
Shh.

35:45.311 --> 35:46.687
Taylor: Up!

35:46.771 --> 35:48.481
Clear a path!

35:48.564 --> 35:50.733
Davies: I want food
in every black belly.

35:50.817 --> 35:52.193
Move!

35:52.276 --> 35:53.945
Just beat them back!

35:54.028 --> 35:56.030
Back! Move your filthy legs!

35:56.155 --> 35:58.199
Man: Eat!

35:58.282 --> 35:59.700
Don't look at me, monkey.

35:59.784 --> 36:01.285
Clear a path! Move!

36:01.994 --> 36:04.038
- Don't let them spit it out.
- Back, back!

36:04.163 --> 36:05.873
Move, monkey!

36:05.957 --> 36:07.208
Taylor:
Move sharply, lads!

36:07.291 --> 36:08.543
Faster they're fed,

36:08.626 --> 36:10.044
faster we're out of this privy.

36:10.169 --> 36:12.089
Peck: Shove it in their faces,
but make them eat.

36:12.171 --> 36:15.716
Watch their hands, boys,
and their teeth.

36:15.800 --> 36:19.095
Eat now or go hungry.

36:19.178 --> 36:21.264
Quickly, or you'll get nothing.

36:28.104 --> 36:29.897
Feed him, boy!

36:32.358 --> 36:34.277
Eat, nigger.

36:34.360 --> 36:36.988
No "nigger eat."

36:39.365 --> 36:42.577
Here's another one
who won't eat, Captain.

36:45.496 --> 36:48.749
A sharp poke in the ribs
if you need, boys.

36:53.504 --> 36:55.298
Secure his chin.

36:57.341 --> 36:58.593
Don't fight me, monkey.

[grunting]

37:00.011 --> 37:01.804

Hold still.

59:15.345 --> 59:16.638
But I do.

59:16.721 --> 59:19.307
You can't buy a slave.

59:19.390 --> 59:21.851
You got to make a slave.

59:23.019 --> 59:26.356
John: Connelly.
Georgia man is here to buy.

59:26.439 --> 59:28.650
Ephraim, here.

59:29.943 --> 59:32.612
Candide, and...

59:32.695 --> 59:34.030
yes, Miss Ellen.

59:34.113 --> 59:35.549
Connelly: Come on, you're going
Georgia way.

59:35.573 --> 59:38.284
Not my mama! You can't!

59:38.368 --> 59:40.828
Not me, Massa! Please!

59:40.912 --> 59:42.723
Ah, shush, shush, shush, shush,
shush, shush, shush.

59:42.747 --> 59:44.058
- Come on.
- Get them in the wagon.

59:44.082 --> 59:45.375
- Please!
- Get ahold of them.

59:45.458 --> 59:47.126
- Got my daughter!
- Get them inside!

59:47.210 --> 59:48.670
Waller:
That one's a fine cook

59:48.753 --> 59:50.546
and I gave you
a damn fine price for her.

59:50.630 --> 59:53.007
- All right?
- Samson, sir.

59:53.091 --> 59:54.592
He's more trouble now
than help.

59:54.676 --> 59:58.179
It'll send a message to them all
and put some extra money in your pocket.

59:58.596 --> 01:00:00.348
Very good.

01:00:00.431 --> 01:00:02.600
All right, come on, take him.

01:00:02.684 --> 01:00:04.310
Get him in the back
of the wagon.

01:00:04.394 --> 01:00:05.895
Come on, move.
Hurry up.

01:00:05.979 --> 01:00:08.481
Samson work harder than anybody
on this farm, Master Waller.

01:00:09.732 --> 01:00:12.151
[panting] Massa, please.

01:00:12.235 --> 01:00:13.903
My daughter, Massa.

01:00:15.071 --> 01:00:16.948
John: You sure about Samson?

01:00:17.031 --> 01:00:20.159
Who we gonna get to break
the African boy?

01:00:20.243 --> 01:00:22.870
I need to speak to you
about that, sir.

01:00:22.954 --> 01:00:24.956
In private.

01:00:26.749 --> 01:00:29.335
Get the African chained up
in a tobacco shed.

01:00:29.419 --> 01:00:32.046
[Ellen crying]

01:00:36.134 --> 01:00:37.385
Tabitha: Mama!

01:00:49.272 --> 01:00:50.648
[door opens]

01:00:56.654 --> 01:00:58.031
John:
This one is easily spooked.

01:00:59.032 --> 01:01:00.992
Elizabeth.

01:01:01.075 --> 01:01:03.161
I told you,
this is no place for my wife.

01:01:03.244 --> 01:01:05.455
And I almost obeyed you,
darling.

01:01:05.538 --> 01:01:06.956
I only came to find Fiddler.

01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:09.459
- Fiddler: Massa Waller.
- Yes.

01:01:09.542 --> 01:01:12.170
They told me that you wanted to see me.
They didn't tell me why.

01:01:12.253 --> 01:01:14.130
Connelly here tells me

01:01:14.213 --> 01:01:18.009
that you knew the African girl
over at the Randolph place.

01:01:19.093 --> 01:01:21.012
I wouldn't say I knew her,
Massa.

01:01:21.095 --> 01:01:24.140
We didn't do much talking.

01:01:24.223 --> 01:01:25.641
That was years ago.

01:01:25.725 --> 01:01:27.685
Fine notion, sir.

01:01:27.769 --> 01:01:29.812
Fiddler knows his way
around an African.

01:01:29.896 --> 01:01:31.314
Let him handle the boy.

01:01:31.397 --> 01:01:33.483
John. We spoke at length.

01:01:33.566 --> 01:01:35.646
No more purchases for a while,
and look what you did.

01:01:35.693 --> 01:01:39.322
Brother, I do not like holding
so much of your debt.

01:01:39.405 --> 01:01:42.408
What on earth
are you talking about?

01:01:42.492 --> 01:01:45.787
I'm gonna get 30 years
good service out of him.

01:01:45.870 --> 01:01:47.121
And I have money in my pocket

01:01:47.205 --> 01:01:50.041
from selling the niggers
that he's replacing.

01:01:50.124 --> 01:01:52.418
Fiddler: Massa Waller,
that's a brand-new Guineaman.

01:01:52.502 --> 01:01:53.836
It's a mighty responsibility.

01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:55.546
Much more responsibility
for an overseer

01:01:55.630 --> 01:01:57.465
than it is
for a fiddle player like me.

01:01:57.548 --> 01:02:00.343
No, no, Fiddler.
He's yours, starting today.

01:02:00.426 --> 01:02:03.930
And if the boy proves
to be recalcitrant,

01:02:04.013 --> 01:02:06.015
then he'll go
in my pocket, too,

01:02:06.099 --> 01:02:09.435
courtesy of the Georgia man,
same as Samson.

01:02:10.770 --> 01:02:12.480
What are we calling this one?

01:02:12.563 --> 01:02:16.025
- William: Does the lady have a proposal?
- Hey. Hey!

01:02:16.109 --> 01:02:18.694
In Dorset, we had an old slave
in the stables.

01:02:18.778 --> 01:02:21.697
- Don't you ever look at my wife.
- He taught me to abandon sidesaddle.

01:02:21.781 --> 01:02:24.909
Sit astride a stallion.

01:02:26.619 --> 01:02:28.538
Call this one Toby.

01:02:28.621 --> 01:02:31.374
Named after the horse
or the slave?

01:02:31.457 --> 01:02:32.917
Both.

01:02:34.836 --> 01:02:36.212
Come along, Connelly.

01:02:36.295 --> 01:02:37.880
Yes, sir.

01:02:37.964 --> 01:02:39.608
Come up to the house
as soon as you're finished.

01:02:39.632 --> 01:02:41.433
I want to hear all about
the Albrights' party.

01:02:41.467 --> 01:02:43.219
Mrs. Albright
put on a barrel of weight.

01:02:43.302 --> 01:02:45.221
Look like a newborn calf
at the udder.

01:02:45.304 --> 01:02:47.765
I knew it.
I want all the details.

01:02:47.849 --> 01:02:49.225
Yes, ma'am.

01:02:49.642 --> 01:02:50.977
You're hurt.

01:02:51.060 --> 01:02:52.645
It's nothing to fuss about.

01:02:52.770 --> 01:02:53.980
- William.
- Hmm?

01:02:57.942 --> 01:02:59.193
Yes, that could go septic.

01:02:59.277 --> 01:03:00.997
I'll attend to you up at the house,
Fiddler.

01:03:03.239 --> 01:03:04.240
Thank you, ma'am.

01:03:12.165 --> 01:03:13.958
Damn Albrights.

01:03:16.002 --> 01:03:17.879
Playing for six hours.

01:03:18.671 --> 01:03:20.923
Asked the oldest son if
I could take some time to rest

01:03:21.007 --> 01:03:23.885
'cause my fingers
were clawing up.

01:03:23.968 --> 01:03:28.639
Spoiled boy took my hand,
held it over a candle flame.

01:03:29.599 --> 01:03:31.809
I still had to play more tunes.

01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:37.523
But you a tune I never
was expecting to play.

01:03:40.359 --> 01:03:42.028
Just calm down!
Calm down.

01:03:42.111 --> 01:03:43.362
Calm down.

01:03:43.446 --> 01:03:49.327
Why you think that overseer
got Massa to give you to me, huh?

01:03:49.410 --> 01:03:52.997
'Cause overseer know that
you're gonna take off again.

01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:56.209
Then the Massa,
he gonna have to blame me.

01:03:56.292 --> 01:04:01.464
I'll end up like Samson,
going out Georgia way.

01:04:01.547 --> 01:04:03.341
You gonna start working today.

01:04:08.888 --> 01:04:11.182
You'll be planting
a new tobacco field.

01:04:11.265 --> 01:04:13.226
Try to say this word.

01:04:14.727 --> 01:04:15.978
Tobacco.

01:04:18.064 --> 01:04:20.066
Tobacco.

01:04:24.070 --> 01:04:25.655
Tobacco.

01:04:25.738 --> 01:04:27.823
That's right.

01:04:27.907 --> 01:04:31.619
Tobacco like a hole
in a water bucket.

01:04:31.702 --> 01:04:34.956
Makes a... makes a field run dry.

01:04:35.039 --> 01:04:36.582
Run field dry.

01:04:38.918 --> 01:04:41.170
It's gonna be a long summer.

01:04:44.006 --> 01:04:47.385
Killing heat, biting flies.

01:04:49.595 --> 01:04:50.972
Stay light so long,

01:04:51.055 --> 01:04:52.974
it seem like the night
gonna never come.

01:04:54.225 --> 01:04:55.685
I'm gonna get Miss Elizabeth

01:04:55.768 --> 01:04:58.020
to hand you back over
to the overseer.

01:04:58.104 --> 01:05:00.731
I got me a nice, warm spot
like an old hound

01:05:00.815 --> 01:05:04.527
right there at the fireplace
by her feet.

01:05:04.610 --> 01:05:06.737
I ain't gonna let no Guineaman

01:05:06.821 --> 01:05:09.907
get me kicked back out
to that field.

01:05:09.991 --> 01:05:11.367
You understand me, Toby?

01:05:12.618 --> 01:05:14.036
Kunta Kinte.

01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:17.582
No, no, listen to me.

01:05:17.665 --> 01:05:20.918
Massa's wife
done named you Toby.

01:05:21.002 --> 01:05:22.336
Kunta Kinte.

01:05:22.420 --> 01:05:24.213

01:05:24.297 --> 01:05:26.173

with a Guineaman.

You're gonna be Toby now,
and you're gonna be Toby forever.

01:05:37.685 --> 01:05:42.106
And I don't care nothing about
your Africa ways.

01:05:42.189 --> 01:05:47.069
You gonna work hard,
and you gonna cause no trouble.

01:05:47.153 --> 01:05:48.988
You hear me, Toby?

01:05:53.492 --> 01:05:54.744
Kunta Kinte!

# Tobacco gon' my life renew #

- Back to work.

01:07:06.023 --> 01:07:08.025
I'm gonna come by
and see you tonight.

01:07:11.612 --> 01:07:13.948
If you want me...

01:07:14.031 --> 01:07:16.742
you can have me.

01:07:16.826 --> 01:07:20.079
Understand?

01:07:23.958 --> 01:07:26.252
No.

01:07:26.335 --> 01:07:28.170
That be so bad?

in trouble.

from the kitchen.

01:08:10.504 --> 01:08:11.756
With honey.

01:08:14.091 --> 01:08:16.761
Always hungry when you
working in the field.

01:08:16.844 --> 01:08:18.095
I remember that.

01:08:18.179 --> 01:08:19.555
Thank you, Fiddler.

01:08:21.265 --> 01:08:24.185
Your boy ain't keeping up,
Fiddler.

Need to get these hogsheads
to the Liverpool packet.

01:08:28.354 --> 01:08:31.984

it's your fault.

01:08:32.109 --> 01:08:33.359
Almost done.

01:08:36.363 --> 01:08:38.741

What's the matter?

01:08:46.707 --> 01:08:48.834
You don't want to fight,
Guineaman? Come here!

01:08:48.917 --> 01:08:49.960
Don't stop.

01:08:50.044 --> 01:08:51.670
Fiddler: Come on, then.

01:08:51.754 --> 01:08:53.794

- Now, get up, Toby.
- Listen to me.

You're gonna get your head cracked open
like a Chesapeake oyster.

01:09:19.573 --> 01:09:21.658
I need you to get up.

01:09:21.742 --> 01:09:23.410
All right, hear me?

01:09:27.331 --> 01:09:29.792
Connelly: Next time
he doesn't answer to Toby,

01:09:29.875 --> 01:09:31.710
you're the one gets a beating.

01:09:31.794 --> 01:09:35.923
Let's go right now, ask Miss Elizabeth
what she think about all that.

01:09:36.006 --> 01:09:38.509
You think
she can keep you safe?

01:09:38.591 --> 01:09:40.678
Like the Queen of England?

01:09:40.761 --> 01:09:44.430
Ain't just Toby don't know
who he really is.

that Mandinka god hear you?

01:09:52.439 --> 01:09:54.525
Best thing to forget all that.

don't like no Africa god.

01:09:57.194 --> 01:10:02.116

[clicks tongue]

I can't believe
I got to ride 10 mile,

01:10:08.956 --> 01:10:11.417
then I got to work
all damn night.

01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:13.210
Miss Elizabeth called me
a... a prodigy.

01:10:13.294 --> 01:10:14.879
Prodigy just mean
that she... she...

01:10:14.962 --> 01:10:17.256
she rent me out
and she keep all the money.

I swear that my grandmama
sang that...

01:11:09.183 --> 01:11:11.477
'fore I got sold.

01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:14.146
There was a man on the farm,
played this old Africa guitar.

01:11:14.271 --> 01:11:16.106
He... he... I think he played it, too.

01:11:16.190 --> 01:11:18.567
No guitar.

01:11:18.651 --> 01:11:19.902
Kontingo.

01:11:20.694 --> 01:11:25.866
I've been chasing that tune
i-in my head for...

01:11:27.868 --> 01:11:31.163
...a long, long time.

01:11:33.207 --> 01:11:37.127
You must be putting that
Mandinka magic on me.

01:11:37.211 --> 01:11:41.006
Making me think
of too many things,

01:11:41.090 --> 01:11:44.134
tucked away real deep inside.

01:11:49.056 --> 01:11:53.811
My mother sings this to me...

01:11:53.894 --> 01:11:55.980
every night when I'm young.

01:11:58.899 --> 01:12:01.360
It's a real pretty song.

01:12:04.613 --> 01:12:06.740
I'm gonna figure it out.

01:12:07.950 --> 01:12:10.077
Maybe build me one of them...

01:12:11.787 --> 01:12:13.497
...Africa guitars.

01:12:13.580 --> 01:12:15.874
This song is mine.

01:12:15.958 --> 01:12:17.238
Nobody in this place
can have it.

01:12:21.588 --> 01:12:23.298
It's okay.

01:12:23.382 --> 01:12:25.634
It's okay.
[chuckles]

01:12:25.718 --> 01:12:28.178
I can wait
till you share it with me.

01:12:31.098 --> 01:12:33.350
Mama sing her boy
a song like that,

01:12:33.434 --> 01:12:36.437
she must be a fine lady.

01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:42.234
She got to have
a fine... fine family.

01:12:42.359 --> 01:12:44.445
[door closes]

01:13:10.971 --> 01:13:12.890
[chisel scraping]

01:13:37.039 --> 01:13:38.791
William: You cut me off!

01:13:38.874 --> 01:13:40.959
Now I'll pass you.

01:13:41.043 --> 01:13:42.377
Elizabeth: Come on!

01:13:42.461 --> 01:13:44.296
One day,

01:13:44.421 --> 01:13:46.507
she gonna let Massa's
brother catch her,

01:13:46.590 --> 01:13:49.426
and this whole farm gonna catch on fire.
[chuckles]

01:13:51.261 --> 01:13:54.139
I got a surprise for you later.

01:13:54.223 --> 01:13:56.141
Surprise in this place

01:13:56.225 --> 01:13:58.352
be when toubab
do their own work.

01:13:58.435 --> 01:14:01.480
Elizabeth:
[panting] I won.

01:14:03.273 --> 01:14:04.650
Or did you let me win?

01:14:04.733 --> 01:14:06.527
- No, no, no, I did my best.
- [chuckles]

01:14:06.610 --> 01:14:08.570
Although I must say

01:14:08.654 --> 01:14:11.323
I've become rather partial
to the view from second place.

01:14:11.448 --> 01:14:12.658
[chuckles]

01:14:12.741 --> 01:14:13.992
Elizabeth:
Walk him down, Toby.

01:14:14.076 --> 01:14:15.786
See that he gets a good wash.

01:14:15.869 --> 01:14:18.831
Oh, and I like to spoil him
with a bucket of carrots.

01:14:24.086 --> 01:14:25.838
Understand?

01:14:27.631 --> 01:14:29.091
Don't be afraid, Toby.

01:14:32.469 --> 01:14:35.055
Toby?

01:14:35.139 --> 01:14:38.809
Please do this for me.

01:14:44.565 --> 01:14:46.483
Miss Elizabeth
being really kind to you.

01:14:46.567 --> 01:14:48.527
That's her favorite horse.

01:14:48.610 --> 01:14:51.864
- Just do what she say, all right?
- Elizabeth: Fiddler.

01:14:51.947 --> 01:14:54.908
Why are you making me wait
after all I do for you?

01:14:58.787 --> 01:15:01.707
Get the boy to take my horse
to the stable now.

01:15:01.790 --> 01:15:03.208
Yes, ma'am.

01:15:03.292 --> 01:15:05.252
He's gonna do it.
I promise.

01:15:05.335 --> 01:15:07.616
Just got to, uh, be a little patient
with him, that's all.

01:15:07.629 --> 01:15:09.173
Stop protecting Toby.

01:15:12.509 --> 01:15:16.013
You pick up those reins
and tend to my horse.

01:15:17.639 --> 01:15:20.058
John: Is there a problem here,
my dear?

01:15:20.142 --> 01:15:21.768
I want Toby to attend
to my stallion.

01:15:21.852 --> 01:15:25.230
I asked Fiddler for his assistance,
but he's not helping me.

01:15:27.149 --> 01:15:29.109
- You do as Mrs. Wal...
- Connelly.

01:15:32.821 --> 01:15:34.072
Toby.

01:15:35.032 --> 01:15:37.993
Obey my wife immediately.

01:15:45.959 --> 01:15:47.419
Toby!

01:15:48.921 --> 01:15:54.134
Obey my wife immediately.

01:15:58.764 --> 01:16:00.015
Toby!

01:16:00.098 --> 01:16:01.558
William: John.

01:16:06.355 --> 01:16:10.442
You are supposed
to have trained the boy.

01:16:12.110 --> 01:16:15.322
Clearly you've not been
doing your damn job, Fiddler.

01:16:15.405 --> 01:16:17.366
Yes, Massa.

01:16:17.449 --> 01:16:19.326
He gonna clean your horse,

01:16:19.409 --> 01:16:22.204
take care of your horse
real fine, Miss Elizabeth. Real fine.

01:16:25.999 --> 01:16:28.502
Connelly:
Get back to work, Toby.

01:16:28.585 --> 01:16:31.129
Back to work.

01:16:31.213 --> 01:16:33.215
[fiddle playing]

01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:04.871
I thought I'd carved out
a life for myself.

01:17:04.955 --> 01:17:06.540
Why're these white folks
getting to me?

01:17:09.418 --> 01:17:11.086
[chuckles]

01:17:11.169 --> 01:17:14.172
I guess your Mandinka magic
is starting to work on me.

01:17:14.256 --> 01:17:15.507
[laughs]

01:17:15.632 --> 01:17:18.802
Fiddler...
What road is north?

01:17:31.732 --> 01:17:34.443
Just follow the dead niggers
hanging from the trees.

01:17:34.526 --> 01:17:36.403
Get you right there.

01:17:36.486 --> 01:17:38.613
[sighs] I can't stay here.

01:17:38.697 --> 01:17:40.949
When right time come,
I go north.

01:17:41.033 --> 01:17:42.701
Ain't no right time.

01:17:42.784 --> 01:17:45.954
Overseer could walk backwards
and catch you in them irons.

01:17:46.038 --> 01:17:47.789
And the day you run,

01:17:47.873 --> 01:17:50.334
that's my last day
on this farm.

01:17:50.417 --> 01:17:55.589
Besides, can't just fly off
north like a bird.

01:17:55.672 --> 01:17:57.257
Country ain't like it used to be.

01:17:57.341 --> 01:17:59.885
White folks cutting down
old trees fast as they can

01:17:59.968 --> 01:18:02.095
and putting up new houses.

01:18:02.179 --> 01:18:04.598
You got to twist and turn
your way to get there.

01:18:04.681 --> 01:18:06.361
And paddy rollers on the road
all the time,

01:18:06.391 --> 01:18:08.268
just hunting
for niggers like you.

01:18:08.352 --> 01:18:09.686
I'm not scared of paddy rollers.

01:18:12.147 --> 01:18:13.940
Stupid never scared.

01:18:19.154 --> 01:18:24.159
Of course, ain't that many paddy rollers
on the road around Christmas.

01:18:27.996 --> 01:18:29.498
A man could vanish

01:18:29.581 --> 01:18:31.792
before anybody
could tell he gone.

01:18:31.875 --> 01:18:37.255
And the Massa be having
a grand celebration for the baby Jesus.

01:18:37.339 --> 01:18:39.091
Everybody occupied then.

01:18:39.174 --> 01:18:41.927
How soon this English Christmas
is coming?

01:18:44.346 --> 01:18:46.056
It's almost here.

01:18:53.730 --> 01:18:55.041
Elizabeth:
Merry Christmas, Caesar.

01:18:55.065 --> 01:18:57.105
Caesar: Merry Christmas to you, too,
Miss Elizabeth.

01:18:58.110 --> 01:18:59.277
Merry Christmas, Abigail.

01:18:59.361 --> 01:19:00.505
Abigail: Thank you.
Thank you, ma'am.

01:19:00.529 --> 01:19:02.569
- Merry Christmas, Pollidore.
- Much obliged, ma'am.

01:19:02.572 --> 01:19:04.741
- Merry Christmas.
- Blessing to you, ma'am.

01:19:04.825 --> 01:19:07.285
Merry Christmas, July.

Came in to check on you.

01:20:21.568 --> 01:20:25.155
All right.
Now you done it.

01:20:25.238 --> 01:20:28.742
Can't put that chain back together again.
That's for sure.

01:20:29.951 --> 01:20:31.828
Need to get you off of this farm

01:20:31.912 --> 01:20:34.414
'fore the overseer
sees what you did.

01:20:41.588 --> 01:20:44.174
Got to put a lot of miles
between you and this farm

01:20:44.257 --> 01:20:46.343
'fore they know you're gone.

01:20:46.426 --> 01:20:47.928
[laughter in distance]

01:20:49.763 --> 01:20:51.890
[indistinct conversation]

01:20:51.973 --> 01:20:55.393
These boys experts
at catching slaves.

01:20:57.938 --> 01:20:59.731
They not going to catch me.

01:20:59.856 --> 01:21:01.983
Not on her big horse.

01:21:04.110 --> 01:21:06.696
You know how to ride
that hot-blooded stallion?

01:21:06.780 --> 01:21:08.090
She been riding horses
all her life,

01:21:08.114 --> 01:21:09.467
and... and she can't even handle it.

01:21:09.491 --> 01:21:12.035
Don't ride like English lady.

01:21:12.118 --> 01:21:14.120
Ride like Mandinka warrior.

01:21:21.378 --> 01:21:22.921
I know what to do.

01:21:25.298 --> 01:21:30.345
Fancy white folk like to hear a real
musician around Christmastime.

01:21:30.428 --> 01:21:31.680
Me.

01:21:33.640 --> 01:21:37.435
I'll play so they...
so they can't take they eyes off me.

01:21:37.519 --> 01:21:39.479
But I'm really playing for you.

01:21:39.563 --> 01:21:41.898
You understand me?

01:21:41.982 --> 01:21:45.735
That special surprise
I been working on?

01:21:45.819 --> 01:21:47.571
So, when you hear
my fiddle playing,

01:21:47.654 --> 01:21:49.281
that'll tell you
that the overseer,

01:21:49.364 --> 01:21:51.408
he ain't walking around.

01:21:51.491 --> 01:21:54.035
And it's time for you to go.

01:21:54.119 --> 01:21:56.621
At least one of us
gonna be free.

01:22:08.842 --> 01:22:11.720
Fiddler.
What name is you?

01:22:16.016 --> 01:22:17.475
Name from your mother?

01:22:20.061 --> 01:22:21.479
Henry.

01:22:23.523 --> 01:22:26.067
I remember
that's what she called me.

01:22:26.151 --> 01:22:28.194
Henry.

Stay out tomorrow?

Connelly:
I'll go up to the house

01:23:01.728 --> 01:23:03.205
and offer Mrs. Waller
a merry Christmas.

01:23:03.229 --> 01:23:05.523
Enjoy her hospitality.

01:23:05.607 --> 01:23:08.735
Now, Waller will drink himself
to an early bed.

01:23:08.818 --> 01:23:11.696
You can spend the rest of
the night with your wife,

01:23:11.780 --> 01:23:13.031
but be back early.

01:23:13.114 --> 01:23:15.408

a half day without work.

while he was playing for you

01:28:55.540 --> 01:28:57.417

01:29:16.519 --> 01:29:17.979
I ain't the same as you!

01:29:18.062 --> 01:29:19.647
I'm not a nigger, understand?!

01:29:19.731 --> 01:29:21.024
I ain't no nigger.

01:29:21.107 --> 01:29:23.401
- You ain't the same!
- I ain't the same!

01:29:23.484 --> 01:29:25.486
We ain't the same!

01:29:25.570 --> 01:29:28.156
I don't never want to be
the same as you!

01:29:28.239 --> 01:29:29.574
Never want to be the same as you!

01:29:41.544 --> 01:29:43.379
I'm sorry, Massa Waller.

01:29:46.382 --> 01:29:47.592
Miss Elizabeth.

01:29:51.137 --> 01:29:52.930
Massa Waller.

01:29:54.098 --> 01:29:58.352
Sell him.
Or you'll ruin this farm.

01:29:58.436 --> 01:30:00.688
The other gentry
will laugh at you.

01:30:00.772 --> 01:30:02.732
The African boy, he's young.

01:30:02.815 --> 01:30:05.860
He's got... he's got
years of work in him.

01:30:05.943 --> 01:30:07.236
Not this one.

01:30:07.320 --> 01:30:09.739
You can't trust Fiddler.

01:30:09.822 --> 01:30:12.200
Don't do this, Massa.

01:30:12.283 --> 01:30:14.077
Don't do it.

01:30:14.160 --> 01:30:15.703
I spent all my life
working with you.

01:30:15.787 --> 01:30:17.914
Turn him into
money in your pocket.

01:30:17.997 --> 01:30:20.416
And I made you...
good money.

01:30:20.500 --> 01:30:23.044
Send word to the broker.

01:30:23.127 --> 01:30:25.254
Get a good price for me, huh?

01:30:31.010 --> 01:30:32.762
William: I'll buy him.

01:30:36.307 --> 01:30:38.309
This is none of your business,
brother.

01:30:38.434 --> 01:30:40.311
The amount of money
that you owe me, brother,

01:30:40.436 --> 01:30:42.980
the entire estate is my business.

01:30:48.486 --> 01:30:50.905
Anyone looks away takes a turn.

01:30:55.201 --> 01:30:59.080
Toby, I'm gonna give you
a chance to avoid this.

01:30:59.163 --> 01:31:03.960
Maybe Mr. Waller will let
everyone enjoy this blessed day.

01:31:04.043 --> 01:31:08.464
I want you healthy,
so you'll work hard.

01:31:09.632 --> 01:31:11.926
All you have to do
is tell me your name.

01:31:22.145 --> 01:31:23.813
I'm Kunta Kinte.

01:31:26.190 --> 01:31:28.151
Connelly: Son of a...

01:31:28.234 --> 01:31:29.355
[whip cracks]
[Kunta screams]

01:31:29.360 --> 01:31:31.612
Your name is Toby.

01:31:31.696 --> 01:31:34.073
Now tell me your name.

01:31:41.706 --> 01:31:45.126
- I am Kunta Kinte.
- That's not your name.

01:31:45.209 --> 01:31:47.336
- [screams]
- Toby's your name.

01:31:47.420 --> 01:31:49.046
Now, what is your name?

01:31:49.130 --> 01:31:50.548
Say it.

01:31:52.049 --> 01:31:54.802
[weakly] Kunta Kinte.

01:31:54.886 --> 01:31:56.804
[grunts]

01:31:57.597 --> 01:31:59.307
- [whip cracks]
- [screams]

01:32:00.641 --> 01:32:02.351
Toby's your name.

01:32:02.435 --> 01:32:04.896
Now, I'll ask you again.
Tell me your name.

01:32:06.564 --> 01:32:07.982
Say it!

01:32:08.065 --> 01:32:09.150
[screams]

01:32:09.233 --> 01:32:12.028
- Say it! Say it!
- [continuous screaming]

01:32:12.111 --> 01:32:14.572
Toby!

01:32:14.655 --> 01:32:17.992
- Say it.
- [Kunta panting]

01:32:18.075 --> 01:32:19.327
Just say it.

01:32:19.410 --> 01:32:21.329
Kunta Kinte.

01:32:21.412 --> 01:32:23.080
[grunts]

01:32:23.164 --> 01:32:26.250
Toby!
It's Toby! Now say it!

01:32:26.334 --> 01:32:29.003
- Toby! Damn you.
- Please! Please!

01:32:29.086 --> 01:32:31.047
- You black nigger bastard.
- Please.

01:32:31.130 --> 01:32:34.050
You will not move from here
till you say your name,

01:32:34.133 --> 01:32:36.552
not if night falls
or a new day comes.

01:32:36.636 --> 01:32:38.387
Now, you will say Toby.

01:32:38.471 --> 01:32:40.223
Say it. Say it!

01:32:41.599 --> 01:32:43.017
- Say it!
- [Kunta screams]

01:32:43.100 --> 01:32:45.686
- Say it!
- [whip cracks]

01:32:45.770 --> 01:32:47.563
[screams]

01:32:47.647 --> 01:32:51.025
Omoro, I heard my boy.

01:32:51.108 --> 01:32:52.485
Please.

01:32:54.111 --> 01:32:55.696
I'm here.

01:32:55.780 --> 01:32:57.782
No, Binta.

01:32:57.865 --> 01:33:00.701
I can't see our boy.
I've looked for him everywhere.

01:33:01.619 --> 01:33:03.955
- Connelly: Just say it, boy.
- He isn't coming home.

01:33:04.038 --> 01:33:06.082
- Say it!
- [whip cracks]

01:33:06.165 --> 01:33:08.542
- Say it!
- [grunting]

01:33:08.626 --> 01:33:10.544
Say it!

01:33:10.628 --> 01:33:12.213
Say it!

01:33:13.464 --> 01:33:17.635
Say your name your owner's wife
chose for you.

01:33:18.636 --> 01:33:21.973
Say your name so you know
this ain't Africa.

01:33:22.056 --> 01:33:23.641
This is Virginia,

01:33:23.724 --> 01:33:25.726
and you're the property
of John Waller,

01:33:25.810 --> 01:33:28.062
like the horses and hogs,
nothing more!

01:33:28.145 --> 01:33:31.983
Now, say your name
so you know what you are.

01:33:33.025 --> 01:33:34.735
[weakly] Kunta Kinte.

01:33:34.819 --> 01:33:36.070
Say it.

01:33:36.153 --> 01:33:37.905
Say it.

01:33:37.989 --> 01:33:40.074
Say it! Say it!

01:33:40.157 --> 01:33:41.409
[grunting]

01:33:41.492 --> 01:33:42.785
Say your name!

01:33:43.828 --> 01:33:45.413
Say it!

01:33:45.496 --> 01:33:47.748
Say Toby!

01:33:47.832 --> 01:33:50.126
Tell me your name!
Say it, damn you!

01:33:50.209 --> 01:33:52.336
[screaming]

01:33:53.921 --> 01:33:55.172
Toby!

01:33:55.923 --> 01:33:58.259
Say Toby!
Just say your name!

01:33:58.342 --> 01:34:00.803
- He said it. He said it!
- [whip cracks]

01:34:01.887 --> 01:34:04.682
Say it again, louder.

01:34:04.765 --> 01:34:06.392
What's your name?

01:34:06.475 --> 01:34:08.436
- [screams]
- What's your name?

01:34:11.022 --> 01:34:13.858
[grunts]

01:34:13.941 --> 01:34:16.610
[weakly] Toby.

01:34:16.694 --> 01:34:18.946
[groans]

01:34:21.574 --> 01:34:22.992
He said it.

01:34:23.075 --> 01:34:24.493
Massa Waller, he said it.

01:34:24.577 --> 01:34:25.953
[groaning]

01:34:30.666 --> 01:34:32.001
Toby.

01:34:41.927 --> 01:34:43.971
Get me that grease
inside there!

01:34:44.055 --> 01:34:45.806
Connelly: Go home now.

01:34:45.890 --> 01:34:50.061
Everyone go on. Go.

01:34:50.144 --> 01:34:51.979
Tomorrow's another work day.

01:34:53.564 --> 01:34:56.484
If you came from another plantation,
get back there.

01:34:56.567 --> 01:34:58.986
Holiday's over. Go.

01:34:59.070 --> 01:35:01.197
[Kunta groans]

01:35:04.075 --> 01:35:05.910
Where that grease?

01:35:11.749 --> 01:35:14.502
Where are you?

01:35:16.379 --> 01:35:19.507
I'm here, son.

01:35:19.590 --> 01:35:20.883
I'm here.

01:35:22.093 --> 01:35:25.221
Fa. Please.

01:35:26.847 --> 01:35:29.141
Please don't leave me alone.

01:35:30.601 --> 01:35:33.062
You ain't alone, son.

01:35:33.145 --> 01:35:36.107
You got lots of people here
who care about you.

01:35:37.483 --> 01:35:43.030
It don't matter
what the Massa call you.

01:35:43.114 --> 01:35:45.866
You keep your true name inside.

01:35:47.618 --> 01:35:50.579
I'm gonna keep it there, too.
I promise.

01:35:54.834 --> 01:35:56.377
This ain't your home.

01:35:58.629 --> 01:36:00.881
But it's where you got to be.

01:36:00.965 --> 01:36:03.926
[Kunta cries softly]

01:36:11.475 --> 01:36:13.185
I don't know what else
to say to you.

01:36:15.604 --> 01:36:16.939
All I know is...

01:36:19.024 --> 01:36:23.904
Rain that fall in Virginia

01:36:23.988 --> 01:36:26.282
get burned off by the sun.

01:36:28.159 --> 01:36:29.702
[groans]

01:36:29.785 --> 01:36:32.455
Rise up to the clouds,

01:36:32.538 --> 01:36:36.125
and then them clouds,
they drift away.

01:36:36.208 --> 01:36:38.419
They may drift all the way
across the ocean

01:36:38.502 --> 01:36:42.715
till they get to that river
you call Kamby Bolongo.

01:36:45.551 --> 01:36:47.845
Maybe the same rain
that fall here

01:36:47.928 --> 01:36:52.600
fall there, on your own people.

01:36:54.477 --> 01:36:56.312
And I know
they want you to live.

01:36:56.395 --> 01:36:59.440
[panting]

01:37:02.568 --> 01:37:05.654
And they know your true name.

01:37:05.738 --> 01:37:08.782
Kunta Kinte.

01:37:08.866 --> 01:37:12.870
Son of Omoro Kinte.

01:37:15.039 --> 01:37:19.210
You live, Kunta Kinte.

01:37:21.045 --> 01:37:22.463
You live.

01:37:36.727 --> 01:37:38.354
# Oh, oh, oh, oh #

01:37:38.437 --> 01:37:40.147
# Oh, oh, oh, oh #
# Ah #

01:37:40.231 --> 01:37:43.150
# Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh #

01:37:43.234 --> 01:37:45.152
# Oh, oh, oh, oh #

01:37:45.236 --> 01:37:47.154
# Oh, oh, oh, oh #
# Ah #

01:37:47.238 --> 01:37:50.157
# Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh #

01:37:50.241 --> 01:37:51.951
# Had a heart full of hope #

01:37:52.034 --> 01:37:53.744
# I swallowed my pride #

01:37:53.869 --> 01:37:57.164
# Seeing everything
I had go away #

01:37:57.248 --> 01:37:59.166
# Praying for delivery now #

01:37:59.250 --> 01:38:01.126
# Peace on my mind #

01:38:01.210 --> 01:38:04.088
# Now let your grace rain on me #

01:38:05.089 --> 01:38:06.799
# What happened to my freedom? #

01:38:06.882 --> 01:38:08.175
# Separated my family #

01:38:08.259 --> 01:38:12.137
# Bringing to me this foreign place #

01:38:12.221 --> 01:38:14.139
# Now my hope is for surviving #

01:38:14.223 --> 01:38:16.183
# In the midst of evil #

01:38:16.267 --> 01:38:18.143
# Things are never gonna be the same #

01:38:18.227 --> 01:38:21.021
# I wasn't born this way #

01:38:21.105 --> 01:38:24.191
# No, I wasn't born this way #

01:38:24.275 --> 01:38:27.194
# No, I wasn't born in vain #

01:38:27.278 --> 01:38:30.197
# Oh no #

01:38:30.281 --> 01:38:32.157
# Oh no #

01:38:32.241 --> 01:38:36.704
# Why do I feel so much shame? #
