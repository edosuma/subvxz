WEBVTT

00:02.616 --> 00:04.617
E. R.

00:04.718 --> 00:05.933
Previously on E. R.

00:05.934 --> 00:08.379
- She's pregnant.
- Who?

00:09.602 --> 00:10.432
Nicole.

00:10.433 --> 00:13.139
Oh, yeah! Yeah, my stuff just leapt
into her bag!

00:13.240 --> 00:14.633
Nicole?

00:14.834 --> 00:16.315
You know,
I used to have a crush on you.

00:16.416 --> 00:17.958
I used to have a crush on you too.

00:18.059 --> 00:19.289
Glad you came back.

00:19.390 --> 00:20.689
Me too.

00:23.819 --> 00:25.405
- Get in!
- No, I'm good.

00:25.506 --> 00:28.073
- No, you're not!
- Go on, get out of here. Come on.

00:28.274 --> 00:29.555
What was that about?

00:29.656 --> 00:32.404
- I'm being subpoenaed.
- For what case?

00:32.986 --> 00:35.453
Reece. Roger's suing for custody.

00:36.240 --> 00:38.886
E. R. 8x09 "QUO VADIS"

00:40.289 --> 00:43.801
- He drew this?
- Yesterday afternoon.

00:44.244 --> 00:47.406
He's got talent.
Don't you think?

00:48.117 --> 00:49.608
Hey, Jackie.

00:51.989 --> 00:55.020
- Thanks for dropping him off.
- No problem.

00:56.319 --> 00:57.976
Missed you last night.

00:59.900 --> 01:02.647
I know. I had to work late.

01:04.105 --> 01:07.634
No, no, no. I can't play.
I'm gonna come back...

01:07.811 --> 01:11.008
...and put you to sleep.

01:13.723 --> 01:17.631
Dr. Benton? Romano wants you to assist
on a post-op hemicolectomy.

01:17.803 --> 01:19.923
- I'm off at 8.
- It's 7:55.

01:20.093 --> 01:21.882
Well, call Edson.

01:23.549 --> 01:25.254
- Damn it.
- What is it?

01:25.673 --> 01:27.212
It's the ER.

01:27.879 --> 01:31.622
Remember how Carla wanted Reece
to be with you on Father's Day?

01:31.793 --> 01:35.038
- It says a lot. The judge should know.
- That's good. Yeah.

01:35.374 --> 01:37.245
- We'll be okay?
- It's just the first day.

01:37.414 --> 01:40.244
- Maybe I should be there to help.
- Jackie, you are helping.

01:40.412 --> 01:43.408
Rachel Greene. I need a copy
of her attendance records.

01:43.576 --> 01:46.193
- You could have told me.
- I didn't know.

01:46.366 --> 01:48.900
Who's allergic to lilies?

01:49.072 --> 01:51.855
She may not have appreciated
the symbolism.

01:52.029 --> 01:54.562
- Symbolism?
- Lilies are for funerals.

01:54.735 --> 01:57.731
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

01:57.899 --> 02:01.428
- I just wanted to send her some flowers.
- You got his grandmother flowers?

02:01.605 --> 02:04.435
I can't seem to get in her good graces.
How's her leg anyway?

02:04.603 --> 02:07.933
- She's concerned with the girl she hit.
- I already met with him.

02:08.100 --> 02:11.463
- I thought that girl was better.
- Yeah. She's in her upswing.

02:11.639 --> 02:14.552
- About to have a bigger bank account.
- She settled?

02:14.720 --> 02:17.254
- Very good offer.
- Good. So you can fax it to me.

02:17.427 --> 02:19.629
- Who's paging me?
- They need you in Room 2.

02:19.800 --> 02:21.340
- Where's Corday?
- Upstairs.

02:21.507 --> 02:23.496
- Isn't she on for Trauma?
- We just got here.

02:23.672 --> 02:26.455
- I thought she was on leave.
- She's been cleared to operate.

02:26.628 --> 02:28.417
What about all the dead geezers?

02:28.502 --> 02:30.953
There's no evidence of any wrongdoing.

02:31.125 --> 02:32.700
Good news.

02:32.874 --> 02:35.870
When the paramedics roll me in,
I'll take Romano.

02:36.122 --> 02:38.983
- Entrance, left temple, no exit.
- What type of gun?

02:39.078 --> 02:42.523
- Cops said a. 32 at close range.
- Pupils are 5 mm and fixed.

02:42.700 --> 02:44.156
- Who shot her?
- Does it matter?

02:44.324 --> 02:47.568
- Got caught in a gas station holdup.
- Absent blink reflex.

02:47.738 --> 02:50.307
- Probable brainstem damage.
- Did we push mannitol?

02:50.486 --> 02:52.938
- I'm still assessing her.
- What are you waiting for?

02:53.109 --> 02:55.774
Let's push the mannitol,
load Dilantin and hyperventilate.

02:55.941 --> 02:59.478
- I was taking Gallant through the exam.
- Treat the patient first, okay?

02:59.646 --> 03:02.215
ABG, gram of Ancef and a head CT.

03:02.394 --> 03:04.632
- What's the GCS?
- Elizabeth, it's 8:20.

03:04.809 --> 03:05.922
Sorry. I had to change.

03:06.017 --> 03:08.731
Let's call Neurosurg if there's
something fixable on CT.

03:08.766 --> 03:10.136
- What's the rush?
- I have to go.

03:10.205 --> 03:12.556
- Heart rate's 50.
- Push an amp of atropine.

03:12.628 --> 03:15.974
- Is there a problem, Peter?
- You're late. I have to get out of here.

03:17.000 --> 03:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:06.623 --> 04:10.074
- What's the caloric reflex?
- Slow deviation to the stimulus.

04:10.251 --> 04:11.662
And then?

04:12.879 --> 04:14.622
Saccadic return to the midline.

04:14.797 --> 04:17.666
Date of birth: 9/12/73.

04:17.841 --> 04:20.665
- Dr. Benton ever in a good mood?
- He has his moments.

04:22.137 --> 04:23.715
Go ahead.

04:24.306 --> 04:27.342
- No response.
- Looks like she's a donor.

04:28.434 --> 04:31.435
- I'll be right back.
- Is there any family we can call for you?

04:31.604 --> 04:35.352
Her parents live in Minnesota.
We were gonna drive there today.

04:35.524 --> 04:38.359
- This is Dr. Corday.
- I'm so sorry, Mr. Pruitt.

04:39.361 --> 04:40.606
Are you gonna operate?

04:41.530 --> 04:46.448
The bullet passed through the brainstem.
I'm afraid no surgery can repair that.

04:49.787 --> 04:52.788
Is there any chance that she'll survive?

04:53.249 --> 04:55.406
She's no longer breathing on her own.

04:57.127 --> 04:59.618
We have to wait and see
if she regains consciousness.

04:59.796 --> 05:02.631
But it's highly unlikely.

05:02.798 --> 05:05.716
The medical exam is consistent
with brain death.

05:09.305 --> 05:11.973
I was still asleep when she left.

05:14.517 --> 05:18.811
I know this is a difficult time,
but we found a donor card.

05:18.979 --> 05:21.649
- A what?
- Your wife wanted to be an organ donor.

05:22.275 --> 05:25.144
Oh. Yeah, I guess
that's what she wanted.

05:25.319 --> 05:27.228
- Can I go see her?
- Yeah, sure.

05:28.655 --> 05:31.325
Elizabeth, we need you in here.

05:33.034 --> 05:35.110
Started an 18-gauge in the left AC.

05:35.203 --> 05:37.076
Rudy Escalona, 15 years old.

05:37.246 --> 05:40.911
LOC from blunt head trauma.
One, two, three!

05:41.876 --> 05:44.033
Boxing league. He took a lot of punches.

05:44.378 --> 05:45.836
Any medical problems, Rudy?

05:47.797 --> 05:50.288
- No. He's in good shape.
- Do you know where you are?

05:50.550 --> 05:53.123
I hit him, man.
I hit him good.

05:53.302 --> 05:56.468
- Pulse ox is 98 on two liters.
- Pupils equal and reactive.

05:56.639 --> 06:00.422
- Do you know what year it is?
- Nobody thought I could do it.

06:00.600 --> 06:02.639
- Answer the doctor.
- But I did it.

06:02.811 --> 06:04.353
Squeeze my hand, Rudy.

06:04.896 --> 06:06.888
- Haleh?
- He's not responding.

06:07.065 --> 06:09.187
We need to get some information
from you, sir.

06:09.358 --> 06:12.644
- Airway's okay. Still has gag.
- No. I'll stay.

06:12.820 --> 06:17.647
- After the x-rays, you can come back.
- Soft abdomen. No guarding or rebounds.

06:18.533 --> 06:20.858
- How late are you on?
- Peter should be back by 6.

06:21.328 --> 06:24.032
I'm on till 10.
Could you check Rachel's homework?

06:24.205 --> 06:26.363
Sure. Lateral C-spine and a head CT.

06:26.540 --> 06:29.707
She needs help with her trinomials.
Normal Babinski.

06:29.877 --> 06:33.459
- I believe I failed algebra.
- It's either that or Revolutionary War.

06:33.631 --> 06:35.504
- I'll stick with math.
- Yeah.

06:35.674 --> 06:38.206
- Why can't you talk to HR?
- It won't change the outcome.

06:38.384 --> 06:40.424
Nicole deserves a second chance.

06:40.512 --> 06:42.136
Is that your objective opinion?

06:42.305 --> 06:44.593
She made a mistake.
I know it won't happen again.

06:44.765 --> 06:47.719
The hospital has a zero-tolerance
policy against stealing.

06:47.893 --> 06:50.349
But if you explain, they might reconsider.

06:50.437 --> 06:52.097
There is nothing to explain.

06:52.272 --> 06:54.893
- Just do it as a favor to me.
- I'm sorry, I can't.

06:55.067 --> 06:58.233
Or you won't?
Please. I got her the job.

06:58.403 --> 07:00.395
You should have screened her first.

07:00.571 --> 07:03.061
Carter, what is this abscess
still doing in Exam 4?

07:03.240 --> 07:05.197
- It's perirectal.
- Yeah, it needs surgery.

07:05.367 --> 07:08.368
- So you're on this too, Susan?
- Carter wanted a second opinion.

07:08.536 --> 07:11.905
No. Call Surgery. We're busy.
One doctor per patient.

07:14.083 --> 07:17.417
- Have fun suturing.
- Have fun with your rectum.

07:17.962 --> 07:19.420
When was your last tetanus shot?

07:20.922 --> 07:22.417
You better ask my dad. I...

07:23.258 --> 07:26.923
- Jorge, this is Dr. Lewis.
- Hi. How's his exam?

07:27.095 --> 07:29.764
Two-centimeter lac on the labial mucosa.

07:29.847 --> 07:32.420
Suggest an interrupted 4-0 Vicryl.

07:32.599 --> 07:35.387
- How'd you get hurt?
- He was boxing.

07:35.561 --> 07:37.886
- And the other guy?
- You tell me.

07:38.063 --> 07:40.933
The patient in Trauma 1?
Jorge's little brother, Rudy.

07:41.107 --> 07:42.435
He got in a good one.

07:42.609 --> 07:46.060
I kind of lost it, but I didn't mean
to hurt him. Not bad.

07:46.446 --> 07:47.726
There you are.

07:48.114 --> 07:49.359
How's Rudy?

07:49.532 --> 07:52.698
They say he's gonna wake up,
he's gonna be all right. You okay?

07:52.868 --> 07:55.275
- He needs a couple of stitches.
- Does it hurt?

07:55.454 --> 07:56.912
No.

07:57.080 --> 07:59.750
This is one tough kid.

08:01.459 --> 08:04.994
Be careful with your reaction to
the testimony. No sighing, no faces.

08:05.171 --> 08:07.377
- What if I have a question?
- Write it down.

08:07.548 --> 08:09.914
- They switched judges on us.
- Who'd we draft?

08:10.008 --> 08:11.419
- Alter.
- Is that good or bad?

08:11.594 --> 08:14.594
He always favors the mother.
That's not a problem in this case.

08:14.763 --> 08:18.463
It wouldn't hurt to show a maternal side.
Is that the tie you're wearing?

08:18.641 --> 08:21.975
- What's wrong with it?
- It's a little showy, don't you think?

08:22.812 --> 08:25.349
And don't get too emotional.

08:25.439 --> 08:27.645
You don't wanna come across
as cold either.

08:27.816 --> 08:29.607
You make it sound like a performance.

08:29.693 --> 08:30.724
Well, it is.

08:32.111 --> 08:34.684
That is the whitest tie I've ever seen.

08:35.073 --> 08:36.448
It's blue.

08:36.615 --> 08:38.822
She keeps breaking out in hives,
like a reaction.

08:38.993 --> 08:40.072
- To what?
- I don't know.

08:40.244 --> 08:42.284
Nobody knows.
We've been to three ERs.

08:42.453 --> 08:44.827
- Fifty of Benadryl.
- Push 125 of Solu-Medrol.

08:44.998 --> 08:47.999
We've found guided imagery helps.
Close your eyes, honey.

08:48.168 --> 08:49.911
- Who's her doctor?
- He's in Syracuse.

08:50.086 --> 08:51.497
We're on our honeymoon.

08:51.671 --> 08:54.340
Go to your peaceful place.

08:56.592 --> 08:59.343
- Better hide the good silver.
- What's she doing here?

08:59.512 --> 09:03.177
Meeting with Personnel.
I hear she's getting fired.

09:03.390 --> 09:05.845
Let our souls intermingle.

09:06.643 --> 09:10.177
- Any new soaps or pesticides?
- Everything's the same.

09:10.354 --> 09:12.762
- What about latex?
- What do you mean?

09:12.940 --> 09:15.792
Some people are allergic to
rubber gloves, condoms...

09:15.827 --> 09:17.270
- We stopped using them.
- When?

09:17.444 --> 09:19.685
- A few weeks ago.
- We're trying to get pregnant.

09:19.988 --> 09:22.989
Everything's all right.
Feel the warmth of the sun.

09:23.158 --> 09:24.984
Just embrace the joy.

09:25.159 --> 09:27.947
Rudy's vitals and oxygen level are good.

09:28.037 --> 09:29.069
Is he awake now?

09:29.205 --> 09:31.874
Not quite yet.
But he might be able to hear you.

09:32.040 --> 09:34.579
- Go ahead.
- Thanks.

09:38.212 --> 09:43.207
Even before I married Carla, we discussed
it. I knew it would be a challenge...

09:43.384 --> 09:45.922
...but we agreed our first priority
would be Reece.

09:46.095 --> 09:49.344
You took a variety of steps to be
a good parent to him, didn't you?

09:49.515 --> 09:53.180
I learned to sign. I've always been
in contact with his teachers.

09:53.351 --> 09:55.558
I've been volunteering at his school.

09:55.854 --> 09:57.645
And you're self-employed?

09:57.814 --> 10:00.020
I run a website company
out of my home office.

10:00.191 --> 10:04.651
- What kind of hours do you have?
- Very flexible. I make my own schedule.

10:04.820 --> 10:07.567
- You ever needed to hire a babysitter?
- No.

10:07.656 --> 10:09.956
Ever have someone get him from school?

10:09.991 --> 10:10.985
No.

10:11.020 --> 10:13.322
So you've never passed Reece's
caregiving to anyone?

10:13.745 --> 10:14.824
Never wanted to.

10:15.455 --> 10:17.827
Dr. Benton often needs help, doesn't he?

10:18.123 --> 10:20.200
Objection. Outside his scope.

10:20.376 --> 10:23.246
Mr. McGrath has knowledge,
can testify to what he's observed.

10:23.545 --> 10:24.743
Overruled.

10:26.131 --> 10:29.333
Peter has a long list of people
who pick Reece up from school.

10:29.509 --> 10:34.253
His girlfriend, his sister, his niece.
They're all involved in looking after him.

10:34.430 --> 10:38.095
Even Dr. Benton himself has asked you
to help him out, hasn't he?

10:38.267 --> 10:40.425
Yeah. He asked me to get Reece.

10:40.936 --> 10:43.308
But I don't mind.
I wanna be with him.

10:43.479 --> 10:46.149
Did Reece ever mention
where he prefers to sleep?

10:46.357 --> 10:49.026
Your house or Dr. Benton's?

10:49.194 --> 10:52.360
- He likes my place.
- Why is that?

10:52.613 --> 10:54.107
He says it's his home.

10:55.782 --> 10:58.866
Once the procurement teams arrive,
we'll move her to the O.R.

10:59.036 --> 11:01.905
- She'll be on the ventilator?
- Yes.

11:02.080 --> 11:04.618
So her heart will keep beating?

11:05.125 --> 11:08.327
So she'll be alive when
you remove her organs?

11:08.836 --> 11:12.453
Mr. Pruitt, your wife's brain is not
functioning at its most basic level.

11:12.923 --> 11:16.457
There is no medical distinction between
brain death and cardiac death.

11:16.634 --> 11:18.960
You said that the machines
are keeping her alive.

11:19.637 --> 11:24.216
Not exactly. They're merely
keeping her organs viable.

11:28.478 --> 11:30.305
Can't you just let her die naturally?

11:31.148 --> 11:34.102
To get healthy organs, we procure
while the heart's beating...

11:34.276 --> 11:36.149
...and there's oxygen
in the bloodstream.

11:36.570 --> 11:39.321
I don't know.
I don't know.

11:39.614 --> 11:42.822
We never talked about this.
I know she filled out the card-

11:42.992 --> 11:45.114
I understand.

11:45.911 --> 11:47.820
I'm not so sure that I can do this.

11:51.624 --> 11:53.996
Why don't you take some time with her.

11:54.168 --> 11:56.493
I'll come back and we'll talk some more.

11:58.005 --> 12:00.412
Dr. Corday, pre-op's ready.

12:00.591 --> 12:02.749
We're gonna wait a bit.

12:04.678 --> 12:07.513
Abby? I need morphine
for a perilunate dislocation.

12:07.680 --> 12:09.139
How much?

12:09.474 --> 12:11.716
Get 20, just to be safe.

12:11.893 --> 12:14.847
- What's the patient's name?
- Bovard.

12:15.688 --> 12:18.937
I saw Nicole. They let her go?

12:20.859 --> 12:23.646
- I'm sure she'll find another job.
- It's not important.

12:23.820 --> 12:27.023
She might want to take it easy now,
with the baby coming.

12:28.199 --> 12:30.025
She's keeping it?

12:30.827 --> 12:32.534
You thought she wouldn't?

12:33.370 --> 12:36.455
I don't know.
It's tough being a single mother.

12:36.623 --> 12:38.662
Maybe she won't be.

12:39.084 --> 12:41.788
- I need some Versed too.
- You can't be serious.

12:42.378 --> 12:44.952
- She's a good person.
- You met her five minutes ago.

12:45.131 --> 12:46.874
It's the right thing to do.

12:47.758 --> 12:50.213
Did she ever take a pregnancy test?

12:50.385 --> 12:52.010
- Of course.
- Did you see it?

12:53.556 --> 12:55.346
- I mean, in front of you?
- I trust her.

12:55.515 --> 12:57.721
What exactly has she done
to deserve that?

12:57.893 --> 13:00.727
Even if it is yours,
there's other ways to help.

13:04.982 --> 13:07.188
- How much Versed?
- I'll do it.

13:07.359 --> 13:10.197
- No, I'll do it.
- I said, I'll do it.

13:16.612 --> 13:18.985
There was bleeding inside Rudy's brain.

13:19.073 --> 13:20.236
How bad is it?

13:20.409 --> 13:22.034
Problem's the arterial wall.

13:22.119 --> 13:24.658
If we prevent any further hemorrhage,
should be okay.

13:24.830 --> 13:27.785
He's always begging to get in the ring.
I shouldn't have let him.

13:27.959 --> 13:30.996
This is from a pre-existing condition.

13:31.089 --> 13:32.120
What do you have to do?

13:32.257 --> 13:36.009
The neuroradiologist can use a catheter
to mend the artery from within.

13:36.178 --> 13:38.884
- And then he'll be okay?
- He should be.

13:39.056 --> 13:43.222
Look, you didn't cause this, okay?
It could have happened at any time.

13:43.604 --> 13:45.811
It happened when I hit him.

13:46.065 --> 13:48.308
Susan, you have Curtain 2?
Woman with hives?

13:48.485 --> 13:50.775
- No. I've got the thyrotoxicosis.
- It's mine.

13:50.947 --> 13:53.485
- Is she ready for dispo?
- No. I'm still working her up.

13:53.658 --> 13:56.364
Either one of you guys ever heard
of an allergy to semen?

13:56.537 --> 13:58.863
Maybe an aversion, but not an allergy.

13:59.040 --> 14:01.532
It's hundreds of proteins
that are potential antigens.

14:01.710 --> 14:03.502
That your best diagnosis?

14:03.671 --> 14:05.961
- It's a possibility.
- You must be desperate.

14:06.132 --> 14:08.969
- This is Sean Gatney.
- My foot's stuck.

14:09.136 --> 14:11.675
- You doing okay?
- His dad wouldn't let us break it.

14:11.848 --> 14:15.300
- The toilet?
- It's a personal hygiene system.

14:15.478 --> 14:18.017
You're out of your mind.

14:18.857 --> 14:21.891
- Dr. Weaver, right? Sandy Lopez.
- Right.

14:21.985 --> 14:24.358
Good job. I hear the lady
and the baby are doing okay.

14:24.531 --> 14:27.105
- Hey, Abby, I got this.
- Okay.

14:28.369 --> 14:29.650
Do you need something?

14:29.829 --> 14:32.831
- I was looking for Luka.
- He's with a patient.

14:33.542 --> 14:35.618
Do you want a cup of coffee?

14:36.379 --> 14:39.250
Based on your extensive observation
of Dr. Benton and Reece...

14:39.675 --> 14:41.882
...how would you summarize
their relationship?

14:42.094 --> 14:45.214
Peter's completely devoted to Reece.

14:45.390 --> 14:48.226
He's always focused on
what's best for him.

14:48.394 --> 14:50.886
I can't imagine anyone
being a better father.

14:51.064 --> 14:52.689
Thank you.

14:54.986 --> 14:57.773
- Are you and Dr. Benton married?
- No.

14:58.407 --> 15:00.899
- Living together?
- We've discussed it.

15:01.077 --> 15:03.913
- How long have you been a couple?
- Almost three years.

15:04.748 --> 15:06.575
So you didn't break up in June?

15:07.084 --> 15:09.496
- It wasn't exactly a breakup-
- Then get together again...

15:09.531 --> 15:10.626
about two weeks ago?

15:10.697 --> 15:13.633
- Are you tracking my love life?
- Objection. Argumentative.

15:13.801 --> 15:16.127
- Sustained.
- Let me ask:

15:16.304 --> 15:18.926
Do you consider yourself
a stable factor in Reece's life?

15:19.100 --> 15:20.180
I do.

15:20.259 --> 15:22.268
How can we be sure you two
won't break up again next week...

15:22.436 --> 15:26.272
- ...or next month? Next year?
- Objection. Calls for prophecy.

15:26.442 --> 15:30.227
- Goes to the stability of the home.
- Point taken. But you can answer.

15:30.530 --> 15:33.448
It's my intention to be around
Peter and Reece for a long time.

15:34.159 --> 15:36.651
You occasionally babysit
for Reece, don't you?

15:37.038 --> 15:38.866
Quite often. We get along well.

15:39.292 --> 15:43.242
There was an incident with a piano.
Could you explain?

15:43.546 --> 15:46.120
- Reece hurt himself.
- Under your care.

15:46.884 --> 15:50.299
- It wasn't my-
- That's the supervision Dr. Benton...

15:50.472 --> 15:53.634
- ... entrusts his son to.
- I looked away for two seconds.

15:53.809 --> 15:56.135
When he should be looking after him.

15:56.229 --> 15:57.558
Are you gonna ask a question?

15:57.731 --> 16:02.062
Counselors, let's all breathe.
Fifteen-minute recess.

16:05.824 --> 16:07.200
Thanks.

16:07.368 --> 16:09.990
- Is that decaf?
- No.

16:10.497 --> 16:14.365
- Oh. I shouldn't have caffeine.
- Oh, right. I forgot.

16:16.296 --> 16:18.171
Luka told you?

16:21.178 --> 16:24.095
- Have you had a pre-natal exam yet?
- Not yet.

16:24.265 --> 16:26.423
I used to work in OB.
I could do an ultrasound.

16:27.184 --> 16:29.557
That's nice of you,
but I'll take care of it.

16:29.897 --> 16:31.937
How do you know you're pregnant?

16:34.193 --> 16:36.233
Thanks for the coffee.

16:36.530 --> 16:39.104
This is not the way to get Luka.

16:39.324 --> 16:42.576
- What are you talking about?
- The truth.

16:44.372 --> 16:47.666
- What happened to your father?
- He killed himself when I was little.

16:47.877 --> 16:52.206
And then, miraculously, he came back
to life so he could kick you out at 16?

16:53.009 --> 16:56.794
- Is this funny to you?
- No. I'm just trying to figure it out.

16:56.972 --> 16:59.049
You haven't told anyone
the same story twice.

17:00.226 --> 17:03.596
My mother re-married and my stepfather
didn't want me around.

17:04.898 --> 17:07.224
Okay. I guess you have
an answer for everything.

17:07.402 --> 17:10.569
- I guess everything's your business.
- I don't want to see him hurt.

17:10.740 --> 17:12.696
Maybe you don't want to see him happy.

17:17.455 --> 17:19.912
I know what won't make him happy.

17:20.252 --> 17:22.042
A made-up life.

17:22.212 --> 17:25.962
You know, if this is all for real,
that's great. Go for it.

17:26.134 --> 17:29.254
But if it's not, he's gonna figure it out.
He's not stupid.

17:35.812 --> 17:37.852
I never got a chance to thank you for...

17:37.941 --> 17:39.269
Saving your life?

17:39.443 --> 17:41.351
Yeah, that.

17:41.528 --> 17:44.399
It was no sweat.
It was a crazy night.

17:44.574 --> 17:46.614
It's a pretty crazy job.

17:46.785 --> 17:49.406
I haven't met too many
female firefighters.

17:49.580 --> 17:51.787
Only one in Company B.

17:51.957 --> 17:55.956
- Must be pretty challenging.
- No, not really. I'm just one of the guys.

17:58.133 --> 18:02.131
- Anyway, I'll see you around.
- Did you get a wound check?

18:02.304 --> 18:05.176
Your hand.

18:05.767 --> 18:07.427
I don't like doctors.

18:07.602 --> 18:09.679
Let me take a look at it before you go.

18:09.897 --> 18:12.020
Maybe some other time.

18:15.153 --> 18:16.185
What happened?

18:16.281 --> 18:18.688
Rudy dropped his sats. BP is 230/120.

18:18.867 --> 18:21.192
- Pulse ox, 78/15.
- He stopped breathing.

18:21.370 --> 18:23.992
- One of Pavulon, 100 of sux.
- What's going on?

18:24.165 --> 18:26.205
Check the fundi.

18:26.501 --> 18:29.160
- There's pressure in his brain.
- What are you gonna do?

18:29.338 --> 18:32.044
- We're gonna help him breathe first.
- Multifocal PVCs.

18:32.383 --> 18:35.718
- Dr. Greene?
- Push another 100 of lidocaine.

18:35.888 --> 18:37.519
- It's Rachel.
- Can't talk.

18:37.679 --> 18:39.512
Start Nipride at 70 mics.

18:39.685 --> 18:42.722
- She said you told her to check in.
- Elizabeth will be home at 6.

18:43.856 --> 18:47.023
I'm in. Lily, another 60 of nimodipine.

18:47.111 --> 18:48.142
I'll get it.

18:49.155 --> 18:51.231
- Looks like V-tach.
- Oh, God.

18:51.407 --> 18:55.572
No pulse. Charge to 200.
Start compressions.

18:56.956 --> 18:59.033
Ever try a non-heart-beating protocol?

18:59.125 --> 19:00.289
I observed one at Case Western.

19:00.461 --> 19:02.619
They go to the O.R., turn off the vent,

19:02.713 --> 19:04.208
and wait for the heart to stop beating.

19:04.382 --> 19:06.459
Meanwhile, lack of oxygen
can ruin the organs.

19:06.635 --> 19:09.209
You remove them after only
two minutes of cardiac arrest.

19:09.555 --> 19:11.548
They'll be viable, with a natural death.

19:11.724 --> 19:13.219
She's dead either way.

19:13.394 --> 19:15.719
This approach compromises
the transplant.

19:15.897 --> 19:18.602
It's the only approach
the husband will consent to.

19:18.984 --> 19:21.143
You know that for a fact?

19:21.320 --> 19:24.405
- You presented this to Mr. Pruitt?
- Luka?

19:25.659 --> 19:29.408
- I suggested it as an option.
- Without consulting me?

19:29.581 --> 19:31.075
She's my patient too.

19:31.249 --> 19:33.575
You're not the one who needs approval
for an unconventional procedure,

19:33.669 --> 19:35.247
nor you're the one going to have to do it.

19:38.800 --> 19:41.257
- Can you take a break?
- Yeah.

19:42.430 --> 19:44.340
Dr Weaver, is there anyone in Exam 4?

19:44.474 --> 19:46.134
The middle bed's free.

19:46.310 --> 19:48.018
I don't wanna tie up a monitor.

19:48.188 --> 19:49.730
Hey, do I have to keep this in my arm?

19:49.814 --> 19:52.306
Yeah. You might need emergency meds.

19:52.484 --> 19:56.065
- What if someone comes in?
- These doors lock from the inside.

19:56.482 --> 19:59.154
- Oh, my God.
- Is that what I think it is?

20:00.077 --> 20:01.952
Just give me one second.

20:02.121 --> 20:03.830
Wasn't this guy going to the morgue?

20:03.999 --> 20:05.873
- Yeah, I was just about to.
- Get him out.

20:06.627 --> 20:08.335
- We need epi in here.
- How many amps?

20:08.505 --> 20:11.790
- As much as you can carry.
- Maybe this isn't such a good idea.

20:11.967 --> 20:13.961
No. It'll be fine.

20:15.513 --> 20:18.183
- Charge to 360.
- Clear.

20:19.810 --> 20:21.638
- Asystole.
- How long has he been down?

20:21.813 --> 20:23.722
- Forty-five minutes.
- Resume compressions.

20:23.898 --> 20:25.773
- How much epi?
- Push another 4 milligrams.

20:25.943 --> 20:28.897
- How much longer are we going?
- I'm gonna bring them in.

20:29.072 --> 20:31.528
- You're calling it?
- Not yet.

20:36.414 --> 20:39.251
Rudy hasn't had a heartbeat for an hour.

20:39.335 --> 20:40.366
How could this happen?

20:40.544 --> 20:43.796
- He had a massive hemorrhage.
- No.

20:45.217 --> 20:48.504
He damaged the part of his brain
that controls his heart and breathing.

20:48.679 --> 20:51.302
- You said they could fix it.
- There wasn't enough time.

20:51.475 --> 20:53.468
Keep trying, please.

20:54.020 --> 20:57.057
We've shocked him repeatedly.
We've used every drug.

20:57.232 --> 20:59.475
Nothing is working.

21:00.361 --> 21:03.067
Do you want to say goodbye
before we stop?

21:18.884 --> 21:21.376
You fought hard, Rudy.

21:21.554 --> 21:23.714
You never gave up.

21:26.728 --> 21:28.103
I'm proud of you.

21:29.398 --> 21:31.806
- We'll never forget you.
- Shut up.

21:33.987 --> 21:36.063
We love you, mijo.

21:37.825 --> 21:42.155
- You'll always be in our hearts.
- Shut up! Shut up!

21:42.414 --> 21:45.831
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me? Shut up!

21:47.963 --> 21:49.588
Shut up!

22:03.732 --> 22:06.764
Just let us know when
you want us to stop.

22:14.099 --> 22:17.550
I hope it snows. I'd like to see
the city covered in white.

22:17.728 --> 22:19.721
Yeah, it's pretty...

22:19.897 --> 22:22.021
...until your car won't start.

22:22.191 --> 22:24.979
Maybe I can get a job
shoveling sidewalks.

22:25.862 --> 22:28.532
It might be good if you don't
work for a while.

22:28.699 --> 22:31.534
Take care of yourself, the baby.

22:33.037 --> 22:34.662
I need to work.

22:35.415 --> 22:37.823
You don't need to worry about the rent.

22:38.376 --> 22:41.294
I talked to my friend.
I think I found a job.

22:42.047 --> 22:43.956
Wow. That was quick.

22:44.717 --> 22:46.794
He's opening a café in Montreal.

22:47.429 --> 22:49.884
He wants me to help run it.

22:52.559 --> 22:54.351
I can't move to Montreal.

22:55.062 --> 22:58.930
You've been very generous.
I'm thankful for everything.

22:59.567 --> 23:01.394
So...

23:01.903 --> 23:05.771
...what are you saying, that's it?
You could leave like that?

23:06.659 --> 23:10.408
Listen, my shift's over at 7.
Let's talk about this tonight.

23:10.913 --> 23:12.491
I'll call you in a few days.

23:13.249 --> 23:16.001
- Are you angry with me?
- No, of course not.

23:16.169 --> 23:20.666
- Do you think I'm angry with you?
- I hope not.

23:22.092 --> 23:25.672
Then why? I thought
we both felt the same.

23:26.598 --> 23:29.932
You're a good person.
But you talked yourself into loving me.

23:30.102 --> 23:31.300
This isn't real.

23:33.939 --> 23:35.932
I'll leave the key inside.

23:38.361 --> 23:41.197
I made an OB appointment for Friday.

23:41.948 --> 23:44.950
- It's not necessary.
- It is.

23:45.869 --> 23:49.322
No, it's not. I'm not pregnant.

23:51.626 --> 23:54.200
I felt safe for the first time
in a long time.

23:54.379 --> 23:56.289
I didn't wanna lose you.

23:56.465 --> 23:58.671
So I made it up, Luka.

24:01.179 --> 24:04.096
I'm sorry. I made it all up.

24:10.272 --> 24:13.060
- We need two layers.
- Do you know how to bury the knot?

24:13.234 --> 24:15.772
Take your first bite in the center,
deep, then come up.

24:15.945 --> 24:17.820
- You hear something?
- Three knots.

24:17.989 --> 24:20.481
- I hear banging.
- What's that noise?

24:20.659 --> 24:25.072
- I think they're working on the pipes.
- Oh, that don't sound like pipes.

24:25.290 --> 24:27.910
- You got this?
- Yeah, yeah. I think so.

24:28.084 --> 24:29.828
- Who's in there?
- My allergy patient.

24:30.003 --> 24:31.795
- The lady with hives?
- And her husband.

24:31.963 --> 24:34.170
You're tying up a room
so they can have sex?

24:34.341 --> 24:38.386
- I'm conducting a clinical trial.
- Send them to an allergist.

24:38.554 --> 24:41.971
No. That'll take weeks.
They're young. They're aroused.

24:42.142 --> 24:45.676
- They want their answer now.
- Weaver know you're running a brothel?

24:45.854 --> 24:47.598
It's not a brothel if they're married.

24:47.773 --> 24:50.682
- Dr. Lewis, lab's back on Escalona.
- I didn't order any labs.

24:50.818 --> 24:52.645
- Rudy? Kid arrested?
- I had the brother.

24:52.821 --> 24:54.860
That's mine.

24:55.031 --> 24:58.199
It wasn't your fault. Things happen.
You can't explain it.

24:58.368 --> 25:00.860
Did Rudy ever take any stimulants?

25:00.955 --> 25:02.117
I'd never let him do that.

25:02.289 --> 25:05.575
- There was Ephedra in his bloodstream.
- Ephedra?

25:05.752 --> 25:08.207
A natural supplement.
It's in power formulas.

25:08.380 --> 25:11.050
- He drinks Beta-Morph sometimes.
- From where?

25:11.216 --> 25:13.968
From the store. He wanted
a six-pack before we sparred.

25:14.136 --> 25:17.968
- He said he wanted to dust me for once.
- The Ephedra probably raised his BP...

25:18.141 --> 25:20.466
...causing a vessel
in his brain to rupture.

25:20.769 --> 25:23.094
- Why would he do it?
- To enhance his performance.

25:23.271 --> 25:26.059
- He wanted to make you proud, Dad.
- You knew about this?

25:26.233 --> 25:29.484
- He was never tough enough for you.
- Why didn't you stop him?

25:29.570 --> 25:30.602
You kept pushing him!

25:30.697 --> 25:32.191
- And you never let up!
- Calm down.

25:32.365 --> 25:34.904
- No! He was just a kid!
- He wanted to be a champ!

25:35.076 --> 25:36.737
No! That's what you wanted!

25:36.912 --> 25:40.198
- It's over! I'm through!
- This is not how to honor your brother!

25:40.374 --> 25:43.743
- It's my choice! It's not your choice!
- You were born with a gift!

25:43.920 --> 25:46.328
- Come on, Jorge.
- No! Here's your gift!

25:48.342 --> 25:49.670
Here's your gift!

25:54.348 --> 25:57.266
Man, he's spinning everything his way.

25:57.436 --> 26:00.057
We'll get it all back on your testimony.

26:00.230 --> 26:01.428
Hey. Everything all right?

26:01.606 --> 26:05.225
Yeah. I just couldn't sit at home,
not knowing what was going on.

26:05.402 --> 26:07.941
- We're just getting started.
- You testify yet?

26:08.114 --> 26:10.735
- No. Roger went first.
- What'd he say?

26:11.034 --> 26:13.526
That I was the world's greatest father.

26:14.371 --> 26:15.782
Peter.

26:15.956 --> 26:20.917
He made it seem like I ask him
to help out with Reece all the time.

26:22.964 --> 26:25.456
- He lied.
- It's his version of the truth.

26:25.634 --> 26:28.754
Isn't that perjury?
Isn't there something you can do?

26:28.929 --> 26:30.472
- Jackie!
- Why are you lying?

26:30.639 --> 26:32.182
- Jackie?
- Leave us alone.

26:32.350 --> 26:33.927
- Jackie, don't.
- Get away from me.

26:34.102 --> 26:36.178
Wait a minute. Stop it and tell the truth.

26:36.271 --> 26:37.303
Ma'am, step away.

26:37.439 --> 26:40.310
- Jackie, you're not helping.
- Get your own family!

26:40.484 --> 26:43.092
He got us here. It's his choice.

26:43.140 --> 26:46.281
Reece is our boy!
He's our boy!

26:58.712 --> 27:01.916
- What are you doing?
- Getting caught up on my charts.

27:02.092 --> 27:05.591
You were listening. You were.
You were listening to them have sex.

27:05.763 --> 27:08.170
- I am not.
- You usually chart...

27:08.265 --> 27:09.760
in admits or in the lounge.

27:09.934 --> 27:11.263
I can chart wherever I want.

27:11.436 --> 27:14.473
And I don't need to listen to
your porno patients for kicks.

27:17.525 --> 27:19.934
- They stopped.
- See? You were listening.

27:20.112 --> 27:22.864
Do you think she's okay?
You think we should check?

27:25.702 --> 27:29.237
- What's going on in there?
- Ask Carter.

27:34.712 --> 27:38.496
- You broke your fifth metacarpal.
- Damn.

27:38.675 --> 27:40.798
Hey, that's what they call
a boxer's fracture.

27:40.969 --> 27:44.139
- You're gonna be in a cast for six weeks.
- Good.

27:44.306 --> 27:46.976
Dr. Greene, teenager with
a 10-foot fall coming in.

27:47.142 --> 27:50.393
- Get Carter. Clear Trauma 1.
- You want me on that?

27:50.564 --> 27:53.600
Numb him up first.
Hematoma block.

27:55.527 --> 27:58.564
- Does my dad know?
- Not yet.

28:01.075 --> 28:03.317
It'd be better coming from you.

28:06.165 --> 28:08.074
Listen, Jorge...

28:09.251 --> 28:11.494
...everyone has a hard time
talking to their dad.

28:11.671 --> 28:15.585
It's different with him.
He's old school. He grew up in Cuba.

28:15.759 --> 28:16.957
When did he come over?

28:17.928 --> 28:19.920
Before I was born.

28:20.764 --> 28:23.006
He was a great fighter.

28:23.601 --> 28:25.677
When he tried to leave,
they broke his hands.

28:27.105 --> 28:29.430
That's why he pushes you so hard.

28:30.609 --> 28:32.186
Yeah.

28:32.528 --> 28:35.862
I guess he just wants us to have
what they took away from him.

28:37.074 --> 28:38.652
You ever talk to him about this?

28:41.371 --> 28:43.281
Well, maybe you should.

28:47.419 --> 28:49.993
- I'm sorry, honey.
- Maybe you just need a break.

28:50.172 --> 28:53.800
- He never had a problem finishing.
- That dead guy freaked me.

28:53.968 --> 28:57.172
You need to use condoms until
you can try again under supervision.

28:57.348 --> 29:00.348
- I never used to be allergic to sperm.
- It's the semen, actually.

29:00.518 --> 29:02.140
Oh. What would cause that?

29:02.175 --> 29:04.343
Sometimes multiple sex partners.

29:04.522 --> 29:06.811
Have you had more than 10?

29:07.817 --> 29:09.857
- Ten?
- Let's go, honey.

29:10.028 --> 29:12.354
I thought it was just me
and Kenny Markowitz.

29:12.531 --> 29:14.440
What else haven't you told me?

29:14.617 --> 29:16.444
Good job there.
It's very diplomatic.

29:16.620 --> 29:19.786
- It was your diagnosis.
- No. I bring people together, Susan.

29:19.956 --> 29:22.792
- You and Cupid.
- Sixteen-year-old male, fell from a post.

29:22.959 --> 29:24.158
Carter?

29:24.336 --> 29:27.337
- Good vitals. No LOC.
- He's got an obvious ankle fracture.

29:27.507 --> 29:30.294
- No meds, no allergies.
- Okay, everybody, on my count.

29:30.468 --> 29:33.006
One, two and three.

29:33.179 --> 29:35.671
- Pulse ox, 99 on two liters.
- You got any pain here?

29:35.849 --> 29:37.677
- I'm fine.
- Turn your head towards me.

29:37.851 --> 29:40.058
- Need any help?
- Yeah, can you doppler the foot?

29:40.229 --> 29:41.771
- You got it.
- Okay if I cuff him?

29:41.940 --> 29:43.979
Do it on the right side.
Turn away from me.

29:44.151 --> 29:45.977
- BP's 124/78.
- Does that hurt?

29:46.152 --> 29:48.062
- No.
- Neck's clear. Get him off the board.

29:48.238 --> 29:50.480
- Bounding dorsalis pedis.
- Go.

29:50.658 --> 29:52.900
- What's he in custody for?
- Stealing street signs.

29:53.077 --> 29:55.610
- Anybody else hurt?
- Girl's fine. She's in the car.

29:55.705 --> 29:58.623
- Okay, we're gonna sit you up now.
- What's your name?

29:58.917 --> 30:00.625
Andrew.

30:01.712 --> 30:03.539
Don't I know you?

30:05.424 --> 30:08.046
- Is that your daughter?
- She's not under arrest?

30:08.219 --> 30:09.826
No. Situations like this...

30:09.861 --> 30:12.924
...we like to scare them a little.
Take them down, call their parents.

30:13.099 --> 30:15.556
- Will they release her to me?
- I'll call the sergeant.

30:15.727 --> 30:17.804
- I appreciate that.
- Got a phone I can use?

30:17.980 --> 30:21.100
I adjusted her meds. Have the nurse
call if she has any questions.

30:21.276 --> 30:24.610
- Sandy.
- Still got time for a wound check?

30:24.779 --> 30:27.152
- I thought you had to leave AMA.
- It wasn't bothering me until...

30:27.241 --> 30:28.735
I jammed it rolling some hose.

30:28.910 --> 30:30.534
- Still bleeding?
- I don't think so.

30:30.703 --> 30:32.696
All right. Let's take a look.

30:32.872 --> 30:36.122
- What happens when you're on call?
- We work 12-hour shifts.

30:36.460 --> 30:38.867
- Seven a. m. to 7 p. m.?
- Half the time.

30:39.046 --> 30:43.126
- And the other half you work overnight?
- There's always a surgeon in-house.

30:43.300 --> 30:46.053
- So you cover weekends too?
- Sometimes.

30:46.221 --> 30:49.922
It appears that over half your shifts
are weekends or overnights.

30:50.100 --> 30:52.259
- I'd have to check.
- Tell me what happens...

30:52.435 --> 30:54.643
...when a gunshot victim enters the ER.

30:55.606 --> 30:59.390
I evaluate the patient and I take them
to the O.R. if necessary.

30:59.861 --> 31:02.435
Gunshot to the chest.
How long an operation is that?

31:02.865 --> 31:04.573
- Well, that depends.
- On what?

31:04.741 --> 31:07.233
The path of the bullet,
extent of vascular damage...

31:07.411 --> 31:10.163
...if bypass is necessary
for cardiac repair.

31:10.665 --> 31:12.492
So it could take over an hour?

31:12.917 --> 31:16.786
- Three hours is a reasonable estimate.
- Sometimes longer? Five hours?

31:17.965 --> 31:21.050
- Sometimes.
- If a patient comes in at 6:30 p. m...

31:21.219 --> 31:23.425
...who takes over for you
when you go home?

31:23.763 --> 31:26.883
- I try to get someone to cover for me.
- And if you can't?

31:28.060 --> 31:29.601
Then I stay with the patient.

31:29.937 --> 31:32.974
If an operation takes five hours,
you'll be there until midnight?

31:34.316 --> 31:35.811
That's a rare situation.

31:36.736 --> 31:39.441
- But it happens.
- It's possible.

31:40.740 --> 31:44.156
When you're tied up in surgery all night,
who's looking after Reece?

31:44.328 --> 31:46.736
I have the support of family and friends.

31:47.206 --> 31:49.828
- Like Dr. Finch, for example.
- Yes.

31:50.168 --> 31:52.125
Cleo is very good with Reece.

31:52.296 --> 31:55.048
Yes, we've already covered that.
Who else helps you out?

31:55.591 --> 31:57.714
My sister, Jackie,
picks him up from school.

31:57.885 --> 31:59.843
- And makes him dinner?
- Sometimes.

32:00.013 --> 32:03.130
- Puts him to bed while you're working?
- That's right.

32:03.225 --> 32:05.265
Is she always available?

32:05.811 --> 32:08.646
Jackie's been like a mother
to Reece these last few months.

32:08.814 --> 32:11.037
But initially, after Carla died, she wasn't
so receptive...

32:11.126 --> 32:13.277
to the idea of carign for Recce, was she?

32:13.444 --> 32:16.315
- It was a tough time.
- She has her own children, doesn't she?

32:16.740 --> 32:17.985
Joanie, her daughter.

32:18.450 --> 32:20.241
Wasn't there a boy?

32:21.412 --> 32:23.903
Yeah. Jesse, my nephew.

32:24.207 --> 32:27.159
- He died last year.
- The death was gang-related, right?

32:27.377 --> 32:29.950
- Objection.
- He can answer the question.

32:32.424 --> 32:33.455
Yes.

32:34.051 --> 32:36.127
How is your sister handling that loss?

32:36.303 --> 32:38.712
You know, I'm sorry. I don't...

32:39.015 --> 32:41.553
I don't see how this pertains
to my fitness as a father.

32:41.726 --> 32:43.221
Your Honor, this is far afield.

32:43.394 --> 32:46.765
Goes to the stability of the person
he's identified as primary caregiver.

32:46.941 --> 32:48.352
I'll give some latitude.

32:48.526 --> 32:50.814
Is Jackie under the care
of a psychiatrist?

32:51.404 --> 32:53.148
- I don't know.
- For situation of depression...

32:53.240 --> 32:54.615
...and pathologic grieving?

32:54.783 --> 32:58.235
- She lost her son.
- Is she currently managed by medication?

32:58.412 --> 33:00.321
This has nothing to do with Reece.

33:00.497 --> 33:04.365
Whose side effects include insomnia,
sedation and anxiety?

33:04.919 --> 33:07.042
Why don't you ask me what kind
of father I am.

33:07.214 --> 33:10.583
Ask me about how I was there
when he was born prematurely.

33:10.759 --> 33:13.429
How I stayed in the hospital,
watching over him...

33:13.596 --> 33:17.053
...making tough decisions and praying
over him day and night. Ask me that.

33:17.225 --> 33:21.354
- Your Honor, a moment with my client?
- There's no question before the court.

33:21.521 --> 33:24.393
No! Why don't you ask me
about Reece, so I can tell you...

33:24.567 --> 33:29.060
...there's nothing more important to me
in this world than my son. Ask me that!

33:41.027 --> 33:43.352
- That can't happen again.
- They were provoking him.

33:43.529 --> 33:45.771
- Get used to it, Peter.
- I said what I had to say.

33:45.949 --> 33:47.941
I hope you feel better.
It sure didn't help.

33:48.117 --> 33:49.825
What did the judge say in chambers?

33:49.910 --> 33:52.152
He's impressed with Roger's availability.

33:52.330 --> 33:54.287
- Availability?
- I'm available to Reece.

33:54.456 --> 33:56.995
- We'll have to do better.
- I'll do better tomorrow.

33:57.168 --> 34:00.335
That's not gonna do it.
Your hours are hurting us.

34:00.505 --> 34:03.340
- He's a surgeon.
- It goes with the job.

34:03.508 --> 34:05.750
- Do you wanna keep your son?
- What do you think?

34:06.136 --> 34:09.717
That you need to start setting priorities
and making some hard choices.

34:09.889 --> 34:11.847
That's what I think.

34:16.980 --> 34:19.101
How well do you know Andrew?

34:19.524 --> 34:21.731
What's that supposed to mean?

34:21.900 --> 34:23.775
Does he do drugs?

34:24.237 --> 34:26.907
- I don't think so.
- Are you sure?

34:31.286 --> 34:33.444
- What's this?
- Results of his tox screen.

34:33.664 --> 34:35.906
He tested positive for marijuana.

34:36.331 --> 34:38.741
Aren't you supposed to
keep that confidential?

34:38.918 --> 34:41.955
- Were you smoking with him?
- No.

34:42.214 --> 34:45.215
- Have you ever smoked with him?
- I wouldn't do that.

34:45.967 --> 34:49.301
Good. Then you'll test negative.

34:52.641 --> 34:54.764
Are you serious?

34:54.935 --> 34:57.771
- You don't trust me?
- I trusted you to go home after school.

34:58.021 --> 35:01.225
Dad, he was gonna drop me off,
but then he wanted to stop.

35:01.400 --> 35:03.143
We agreed no rides.

35:03.319 --> 35:05.442
- I missed the bus.
- You should have called me.

35:06.322 --> 35:08.113
I didn't wanna bother you.

35:09.826 --> 35:11.782
It sure didn't work out that way.

35:13.287 --> 35:15.114
You want me to pee in a cup?

35:15.289 --> 35:16.487
Yep.

35:18.667 --> 35:22.997
Yes, a gram of Ceftazidime.
Did the family choose a mortuary yet?

35:23.172 --> 35:27.585
Rudy Escalona. We need to get him
to the morgue. Not the ICU. The ER.

35:27.760 --> 35:31.295
- Do you need me to do something?
- Ask Frank for the decedent packet.

35:32.724 --> 35:34.182
Luka?

35:34.351 --> 35:37.351
You weren't here,
so I gave Collins the gent first.

35:37.520 --> 35:38.931
Thanks.

35:39.105 --> 35:41.014
I had to go out.

35:41.607 --> 35:44.146
- Everything okay?
- She's leaving town.

35:45.528 --> 35:47.023
- Why?
- I don't know.

35:47.197 --> 35:49.688
Dr. Kovac, Exam 4's vomiting blood.

35:49.867 --> 35:51.277
What about the baby?

35:51.493 --> 35:53.367
There is no baby.

35:57.416 --> 36:00.333
I started another line on Zahler.
Did you have a written order?

36:00.502 --> 36:01.961
It was right up there.

36:02.129 --> 36:05.213
Why was Abby about to discharge
my bowel obstruction?

36:05.382 --> 36:06.414
I have no idea.

36:06.592 --> 36:08.715
Because you can't write
between the lines.

36:08.886 --> 36:12.302
Carter, is this one yours?
25-year-old. Severe allergic reaction.

36:12.472 --> 36:14.264
- Mrs. Urman?
- Gave her 50 of Benadryl.

36:14.433 --> 36:16.472
- What happened?
- I guess you were right.

36:16.643 --> 36:18.221
- We followed our bliss.
- Where?

36:18.395 --> 36:19.510
To our pickup truck.

36:19.689 --> 36:22.061
We thought we'd be safe
by the hospital.

36:22.232 --> 36:25.937
- I'll get her started. 300 of cimetidine.
- I will be right there.

36:26.571 --> 36:29.524
- That's a very nice suit.
- Thanks. I was in court all day.

36:29.698 --> 36:31.026
- A patient?
- No.

36:31.200 --> 36:33.324
- Something wrong?
- No. Everything's cool.

36:33.494 --> 36:36.067
Dr. Benton, they need you in the O.R.

36:39.500 --> 36:41.540
Mr. Escalona.

36:42.545 --> 36:46.922
If you'd like, the nurse said we could
make arrangements for the funeral home.

36:47.925 --> 36:51.341
We used Rose Hills
when his mother died.

36:51.637 --> 36:54.556
But I never thought that...

37:00.104 --> 37:02.097
He was a good kid.

37:02.482 --> 37:04.724
He made everybody smile.

37:05.151 --> 37:06.432
Jorge...

37:07.070 --> 37:09.276
...he was the serious one.

37:09.989 --> 37:12.659
I didn't mean to lose my temper.

37:13.076 --> 37:15.448
It's been a hard day, you know?

37:16.246 --> 37:18.571
He doesn't wanna see me.

37:18.832 --> 37:21.157
He doesn't understand.

37:22.836 --> 37:25.754
You should give him a shot.

37:26.298 --> 37:28.587
You know, he might surprise you.

38:09.425 --> 38:12.794
Sorry to be brief, but my nanny
gets off in six minutes.

38:12.970 --> 38:14.797
Diane Pruitt, GSW to the head.

38:14.889 --> 38:17.297
The transplant teams are flying in
from Indiana and Michigan..

38:17.475 --> 38:18.720
Gas station robbery?

38:18.894 --> 38:21.301
Yes. Romano's agreed to
a non-heart-beating protocol.

38:21.479 --> 38:24.396
- When did we start doing that?
- Today, apparently.

38:25.024 --> 38:28.191
That's the husband. If you could
review the procedure with him?

38:28.737 --> 38:31.144
- He's already consented, right?
- Of course.

38:31.322 --> 38:34.240
- So, what is there to talk about?
- He needs some reassurance.

38:34.409 --> 38:36.651
You've had him for 12 hours.
You deal with him.

38:36.828 --> 38:39.699
He wants to talk to
the operating surgeon.

38:40.832 --> 38:43.074
Peter, what's the matter?

38:43.752 --> 38:45.828
Nothing. Go home.

38:46.838 --> 38:48.498
Mr. Pruitt?

38:48.674 --> 38:51.545
Hi. I'm Dr. Benton.
I'll be coordinating the procedure.

38:51.718 --> 38:55.716
As soon as the out-of-state team
gets here, we'll take her to the O.R.

38:57.474 --> 39:00.808
I tried to explain it to her,
but she's too young.

39:01.728 --> 39:04.516
I don't know how I'm
gonna do this by myself.

39:06.692 --> 39:08.565
You're gonna do the best you can.

39:08.736 --> 39:11.607
You're supposed to be on light duty.

39:11.781 --> 39:15.648
- I was moving some gear.
- Yeah. You went on the run.

39:16.618 --> 39:18.944
I get a little stir-crazy.

39:19.122 --> 39:20.402
Okay.

39:20.581 --> 39:22.574
Looks pretty good. No sign of infection.

39:22.667 --> 39:23.698
That's it?

39:24.543 --> 39:27.379
No, you need a new bandage.

39:31.467 --> 39:33.626
So is...

39:33.970 --> 39:38.632
- ... Captain Devlin still at the seven-five?
- I know that name.

39:38.808 --> 39:43.766
Those guys used to hang out
at a place called Moose and Squirrel.

39:43.938 --> 39:45.682
Yeah. Every Friday night.

39:45.857 --> 39:48.264
That was a fun place.

39:49.819 --> 39:53.270
You should have someone remove
the stitches in four days.

39:53.906 --> 39:56.113
I know where to find you.

40:00.204 --> 40:01.865
Listen, Sandy...

40:02.040 --> 40:04.709
Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I bunched it up.

40:04.876 --> 40:07.118
That's all right. What were you saying?

40:08.088 --> 40:09.831
Do you wanna do something?

40:10.298 --> 40:11.543
Excuse me?

40:12.300 --> 40:13.960
Sometime? You know, something?

40:15.262 --> 40:16.970
Something?

40:17.806 --> 40:19.846
Lunch or a movie...

40:20.017 --> 40:22.009
...or ice-fishing.

40:24.646 --> 40:26.972
- Like, go out?
- Yeah.

40:27.149 --> 40:29.936
I mean, unless I'm totally off base here.

40:30.402 --> 40:31.813
No.

40:31.987 --> 40:33.779
No, you're on base.

40:39.161 --> 40:40.786
How's it going?

40:40.954 --> 40:42.497
Fine.

40:43.123 --> 40:45.365
Your drug screen came back.

40:45.542 --> 40:47.500
Everything was negative.

40:48.379 --> 40:50.667
Don't look so disappointed.

40:55.844 --> 40:58.170
I know you're upset.

40:59.223 --> 41:03.303
But I had to do this because
I want you to be safe.

41:04.145 --> 41:09.187
I care more about that than about
you being angry with me.

41:11.611 --> 41:14.232
I wanna be able to trust you.

41:15.740 --> 41:18.492
It's something we both have to work at.

41:19.786 --> 41:21.446
Can I go now?

41:25.209 --> 41:27.366
- Is the recipient ready?
- All I need's a liver.

41:27.544 --> 41:30.415
- The heart team gets first crack.
- Tell them to make it snappy.

41:32.091 --> 41:34.047
Sternal saw's up.

41:34.217 --> 41:37.384
Open the O Dexon.
Atraumatic needle.

41:37.554 --> 41:39.713
- All set?
- Good to go.

41:39.890 --> 41:43.223
After two minutes of cardiac arrest,
we'll begin procurement.

41:43.393 --> 41:45.718
- How's her oxygenation?
- Satting at 100 percent.

41:45.896 --> 41:47.687
Good. Turn it off.

41:47.856 --> 41:51.023
Respiratory support discontinued
at 20:37.

41:55.364 --> 41:57.487
They're sweet.
I hope they get pregnant.

41:57.658 --> 42:00.612
Shouldn't be a problem.
The endocrinologist can wash the sperm...

42:00.786 --> 42:03.407
...then it's safe
to artificially inseminate.

42:03.497 --> 42:04.528
That's a new one.

42:04.706 --> 42:07.577
Just goes to teach you
never to doubt my diagnoses.

42:07.752 --> 42:10.289
Yeah. No matter how loony they are.

42:10.463 --> 42:13.796
I can't believe they did it
in the back of a pickup truck.

42:13.967 --> 42:15.959
- They had a camper shell.
- How do you know?

42:16.135 --> 42:17.380
- I saw it.
- You did?

42:17.553 --> 42:21.088
It's in the front of the hospital.
It's their honeymoon suite. Very weird.

42:21.682 --> 42:23.971
Not so weird. Ferris wheel.
That's weird.

42:25.437 --> 42:27.060
Really?

42:27.230 --> 42:30.599
I was young.
It was my first real boyfriend.

42:31.650 --> 42:33.977
- Where else?
- Your turn.

42:34.445 --> 42:35.821
Camping. Where else?

42:36.614 --> 42:39.449
In a tent, that's the best you can do?

42:43.872 --> 42:45.152
On a train to Seattle.

42:45.790 --> 42:48.460
Really? With who?

42:48.668 --> 42:52.002
I was by myself.
But it was memorable.

42:58.137 --> 42:59.417
It's cold.

42:59.596 --> 43:01.469
Yeah. We should probably go in.

43:01.640 --> 43:03.181
Yeah.

43:12.109 --> 43:13.307
Carter...

43:14.611 --> 43:17.696
You don't have any allergies
I should know about, do you?

43:24.996 --> 43:26.574
Where were we?

43:27.833 --> 43:29.991
- How long's it been?
- Forty-nine minutes.

43:30.169 --> 43:31.876
Tissues could be getting ischemic.

43:32.046 --> 43:35.082
Let's send an ABG, lytes
and a lactate.

43:35.257 --> 43:37.427
Who's in charge?
I ordered liver an hour ago...

43:37.447 --> 43:39.587
and haven't seen my waitress since.

43:39.762 --> 43:41.340
The patient's breathing on her own.

43:41.848 --> 43:43.804
How inconsiderate.

43:43.975 --> 43:47.510
Well, this could take hours.
Page me when she goes.

43:47.895 --> 43:50.053
What do you want to do, Dr. Benton?

43:56.821 --> 43:59.254
Let's just wait.

44:13.028 --> 44:16.075
