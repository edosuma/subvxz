00:01.758 --> 00:03.484
"Thanksgiving"

00:03.866 --> 00:06.253
FRANKIE: <i>Thanksgiving around</i>
<i>here is all about tradition,</i>

00:06.448 --> 00:08.112
<i>spending time</i>
<i>with your family</i>

00:08.147 --> 00:10.159
<i>and being thankful</i>
<i>for everything you have.</i>

00:10.424 --> 00:12.271
<i>Of course, everyone has</i>
<i>their favorite thing.</i>

00:12.390 --> 00:14.489
<i>For Axl,</i>
<i>it's my cranberry sauce.</i>

00:15.575 --> 00:17.612
<i>For Mike,</i>
<i>it's my mashed potatoes.</i>

00:18.047 --> 00:18.778
<i>(beep)</i>

00:18.813 --> 00:21.638
<i>Sue and Brick love</i>
<i>my home-made pie.</i>

00:23.147 --> 00:24.172
<i>But what I love most</i>

00:24.207 --> 00:26.732
<i>is the warm, loving feeling</i>
<i>I get from...</i>

00:26.767 --> 00:28.722
- (bell rings)
- <i>Saving up to 80%</i>

00:28.770 --> 00:30.386
<i>on the day</i>
<i>after Thanksgiving--</i>

00:30.421 --> 00:31.649
- <i>Black Friday.</i>
- (shouting)

00:33.268 --> 00:35.646
Okay, it's one week
to Thanksgiving.

00:35.647 --> 00:38.105
The mall opens at midnight,
so we've got to be prepared.

00:38.989 --> 00:41.941
Sue's on housewares,
Axl's on sporting goods,

00:41.976 --> 00:43.247
Brick can
ferret through the crowd,

00:43.282 --> 00:44.964
so he's on electronics.
Then we'll all rally

00:44.965 --> 00:47.646
- back at the escalator at 0100.
- Sir, yes, sir.

00:48.106 --> 00:50.308
Oh, and when you invite
your dad for Thanksgiving,

00:50.309 --> 00:52.253
can you ask him if he'll drop us off
and then wait for us

00:52.344 --> 00:54.676
so we don't get stuck behind some
slow driver looking for a spot?

00:57.280 --> 00:57.907
Mike...

00:58.499 --> 01:01.070
- Can't you invite him this year?
- He's <i>your</i> dad.

01:01.105 --> 01:01.906
(groans)

01:01.966 --> 01:02.995
He's such a pain!

01:03.030 --> 01:05.322
He'll say he doesn't want
to be a bother

01:05.324 --> 01:08.212
and drag it out until I end up
begging him, like always.

01:08.247 --> 01:11.349
Mike, someday that old pain in
the ass won't be here anymore,

01:11.384 --> 01:13.265
and then you'll be
begging to beg someone.

01:13.266 --> 01:15.276
Fine, I'll ask him,
but I'm not begging.

01:16.735 --> 01:18.638
Can we go
to the corn maze today?

01:19.238 --> 01:22.266
<i>Nothing says fall in</i>
<i>the Midwest like a corn maze.</i>

01:22.301 --> 01:24.442
<i>It's just about</i>
<i>the most fun thing ever.</i>

01:24.856 --> 01:28.413
Oh, I am <i>not</i> dragging my butt
through another corn maze.

01:28.414 --> 01:30.848
- I just can't do it.
- But I've never been.

01:31.160 --> 01:33.595
What are you talking about?
We've been a million times.

01:33.630 --> 01:36.450
With Sue and Axl.
I never got to go.

01:37.216 --> 01:38.586
I never get
to go anywhere.

01:38.724 --> 01:40.596
That's 'cause
you're their least favorite.

01:40.931 --> 01:44.032
<i>Ironically, at the moment,</i>
<i>Axl was my least favorite.</i>

01:44.750 --> 01:46.056
Okay, we'll find a time
to take you,

01:46.091 --> 01:47.277
but today isn't it.

01:48.441 --> 01:51.238
Hey, can I go snowmobiling
with my friends on Thanksgiving?

01:51.273 --> 01:51.906
No.

01:53.508 --> 01:56.008
No, dude, I can't. She just
totally freaked out on me!

01:56.559 --> 01:59.337
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

02:00.550 --> 02:01.798
We were square dancing
in gym class,

02:01.833 --> 02:02.653
and this boy Brad Bottig

02:02.688 --> 02:04.443
kept asking me to dance
all week, and then today

02:04.478 --> 02:06.717
on the third allemande left,
he asked me to be his girlfriend!

02:07.940 --> 02:10.127
Oh, my God!
I have a boyfriend!

02:10.657 --> 02:12.148
(screams)

02:13.940 --> 02:14.940
She's just a kid, Frankie.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.088
- I don't know if I like this.
- (door closes)

02:16.123 --> 02:19.179
Oh, this is just
an innocent junior high thing.

02:19.214 --> 02:22.018
- Don't you think we can trust her?
- It's the guy I don't trust.

02:22.340 --> 02:24.138
I took square dancing
for one reason--

02:24.173 --> 02:25.371
It's a meat market.

02:27.534 --> 02:30.605
60% off on
a power sander for Mike,

02:30.640 --> 02:34.139
100 barrettes for Sue
at Claire's for $1,

02:34.174 --> 02:36.551
2-for-1 cargo pants
for Brick.

02:36.586 --> 02:37.238
(chuckling)

02:37.273 --> 02:38.836
Look at me!
I'm trembling.

02:39.295 --> 02:40.737
I think what I'm most
looking forward to

02:40.772 --> 02:42.995
is watching home movies,
singing around the piano.

02:43.030 --> 02:45.204
My niece, who I haven't seen
in 14 years is coming in.

02:45.239 --> 02:45.796
(gasps)

02:45.797 --> 02:48.378
I gotta get air mattresses
just to host everyone!

02:48.769 --> 02:51.728
MAN: <i>Bob, Hometown Buffet</i>
<i>called about</i>

02:51.763 --> 02:54.642
<i>your Thanksgiving reservation.</i>
<i>They want to know if</i>

02:54.677 --> 02:57.151
<i>you'd share a two-top</i>
<i>with a widower.</i>

02:57.761 --> 03:00.111
- We eat at 6:00.
- Oh, thank you!

03:00.712 --> 03:03.622
All right, team, bring it in.
Take a knee.

03:04.495 --> 03:06.873
Sales are
at an all-time low.

03:07.413 --> 03:11.017
That is why I'm switching
to a 365-day schedule,

03:11.052 --> 03:13.153
like that diner out
on Route 7.

03:13.891 --> 03:14.898
They do very well.

03:15.250 --> 03:15.910
Wait, wait, wait.

03:16.430 --> 03:19.510
Are you saying that
we're working on Thanksgiving?

03:21.183 --> 03:24.266
(scoffs) Mr. Ehlert,
that is just wrong.

03:24.935 --> 03:27.725
Well, so is taking the country
away from a bunch of Indians,

03:28.195 --> 03:29.780
but aren't you glad
we did?

03:37.397 --> 03:38.532
(clears throat)
Mr. Ehlert?

03:38.774 --> 03:40.345
What now?
Tampon machine empty?

03:41.708 --> 03:44.207
N-no, actually, sir,
I was wondering

03:44.242 --> 03:46.827
if I could possibly,
in any way,

03:47.083 --> 03:50.153
have Thanksgiving off
to spend with my family?

03:50.188 --> 03:51.894
Okay, we're gonna
play a little game called

03:51.929 --> 03:53.609
"I be you, you be me."

03:54.071 --> 03:55.259
"Mr. Ehlert,

03:55.294 --> 03:58.483
"I know I'm the newest employee
with the worst sales record,

03:58.669 --> 04:01.463
"and even though I whine
about equality for women

04:01.498 --> 04:04.012
"in the workplace,
can I have Thanksgiving off

04:04.047 --> 04:05.980
"so I can hug my family
all day long,

04:06.015 --> 04:08.377
"even though two minutes ago,
you said I had to work?"

04:09.112 --> 04:09.941
Yes?

04:10.966 --> 04:13.156
Okay, I'm me again.
No!

04:13.368 --> 04:14.892
(sighs) Please.

04:14.927 --> 04:17.914
My family needs Thanksgiving,
and I'm the mom.

04:18.224 --> 04:20.728
I have to cook in the morning,
and we eat in the afternoon.

04:21.100 --> 04:23.140
Fine. You can
work the evening shift.

04:24.079 --> 04:26.554
And if you're still here,
you can work all day Christmas.

04:27.553 --> 04:29.940
Christmas?
Thanksgiving?

04:29.975 --> 04:30.873
This man's crazy.

04:30.908 --> 04:33.129
Who the hell buys a car
on Thanksgiving, anyway?

04:33.164 --> 04:36.342
I know it sucks, but I'm not
gonna let it ruin our day.

04:36.512 --> 04:38.661
We'll eat earlier,
then I'll go in to work,

04:38.696 --> 04:40.417
then I'll meet you and the kids
at the mall at midnight.

04:40.452 --> 04:42.632
And be sure to tell your dad
about the time change.

04:44.795 --> 04:47.963
- You haven't invited him yet.
- I will, woman. Back off.

04:48.705 --> 04:49.894
- (sighs)
- (door opens)

04:50.618 --> 04:51.874
Mom, Dad?

04:52.316 --> 04:55.577
This is brad...
my boyfriend.

04:56.591 --> 04:58.106
(squeals)

04:58.804 --> 04:59.395
(sniffs)

04:59.725 --> 05:01.161
- Be cool.
- Yeah.

05:01.729 --> 05:03.157
Hi, Brad!

05:03.278 --> 05:04.349
(effeminately)
Hi, you guys.

05:04.420 --> 05:07.668
Oh my gosh, I'm super excited
to finally meet my GF's P's.

05:07.859 --> 05:10.670
<i>"Girlfriend's parents."</i>
<i>I looked it up later.</i>

05:10.905 --> 05:14.065
Well, we are so excited
to meet you, too, Brad,

05:14.100 --> 05:15.520
- aren't we, Mike?
- Yep.

05:15.897 --> 05:19.525
So you--you, uh, like to...
square-dance, huh?

05:19.560 --> 05:21.250
Oh, I just love
square dancing.

05:21.285 --> 05:22.765
Well, all types of dance,
really, you know?

05:23.060 --> 05:24.862
Ballet, tap, rhythmic.

05:25.452 --> 05:28.022
O.M.G., is that
vintage flannel?

05:28.312 --> 05:30.270
No. Just--just old.

05:30.305 --> 05:32.005
And super cute.
(chuckles)

05:32.898 --> 05:33.844
Well, thanks.

05:34.309 --> 05:36.306
We're gonna go get
my "Flashdance" CD,

05:36.341 --> 05:38.931
and Brad's gonna show me
some choreography he made up.

05:44.953 --> 05:47.416
Well, he seems nice.

05:47.451 --> 05:48.079
Very!

05:48.581 --> 05:50.046
- Still worried?
- No.

05:50.366 --> 05:52.165
You think we should
say something to Sue?

05:52.260 --> 05:54.844
No. She'll figure it out
eventually, or he will.

05:58.341 --> 06:00.162
What? (gasps)

06:01.336 --> 06:04.022
The Black Friday sale
is earlier this year.

06:04.057 --> 06:07.660
- What's earlier than midnight?
- 6:00 on Thanksgiving Day.

06:07.695 --> 06:10.172
We have <i>got</i> to be there
when the doors open!

06:10.574 --> 06:12.990
Look, the first
100 customers get 20% off

06:13.025 --> 06:15.878
and a free soft pretzel.
All right. Okay.

06:15.913 --> 06:19.356
I'm just gonna have to
go in and... (sighs)

06:19.750 --> 06:21.915
I'll ask Mr. Ehlert
for a different shift.

06:23.501 --> 06:25.421
I know
it's against the rules, but...

06:25.745 --> 06:27.791
can Brad and I
hang out in my room?

06:27.958 --> 06:30.042
Sure. Close the door
if we're bothering you.

06:30.728 --> 06:34.324
<i>So Mike finally went</i>
<i>to ask his dad to Thanksgiving,</i>

06:34.767 --> 06:36.843
<i>which sounds easier</i>
<i>than it is,</i>

06:37.225 --> 06:39.677
<i>'cause Big Mike's</i>
<i>kind of a hoarder</i>

06:39.712 --> 06:41.425
<i>who doesn't like to</i>
<i>leave his house.</i>

06:41.835 --> 06:44.774
<i>Maybe 'cause he's got too much</i>
<i>pride to accept an invitation,</i>

06:45.297 --> 06:48.091
<i>Or maybe 'cause there's too</i>
<i>much crap blocking the door.</i>

06:48.463 --> 06:50.075
I know
you're home, Dad.

06:50.110 --> 06:52.353
Montgomery Ward went
out of business ten years ago.

06:54.659 --> 06:55.635
It's good to know.

07:01.600 --> 07:03.557
So Thanksgiving's coming up.

07:04.149 --> 07:05.587
Is it, now?

07:06.018 --> 07:08.400
Oh, well,
the calendar says it's today.

07:08.753 --> 07:11.121
Yeah, the calendar's
four years old, Dad.

07:12.772 --> 07:13.208
Oh.

07:13.963 --> 07:16.785
Anyway, Frankie's putting
together a nice dinner.

07:17.490 --> 07:18.094
You should come.

07:18.129 --> 07:20.272
I don't want
to be a bother.

07:20.597 --> 07:21.750
You're not a bother, Dad.

07:22.232 --> 07:25.169
Well, don't go
making turkey on my account.

07:25.204 --> 07:26.434
We're making it anyway.

07:27.476 --> 07:28.560
All of America is.

07:30.148 --> 07:32.150
If I come,
you'll just have to

07:32.185 --> 07:34.066
get another chair
out of the garage--

07:34.627 --> 07:36.087
All that hassle...

07:37.040 --> 07:38.748
Okay, Dad,
we're eating at 4:00.

07:38.783 --> 07:40.698
Come if you want.
Don't if you don't.

07:41.124 --> 07:43.124
That's not
much of an invite, is it?

07:43.794 --> 07:44.667
(sighs)

07:47.431 --> 07:50.187
<i>Fortunately, not everyone's</i>
<i>too proud to beg.</i>

07:50.667 --> 07:53.833
Sir, I just found out
my Aunt Ginny

07:53.868 --> 07:56.733
needs emergency surgery
on the night of Thanksgiving,

07:56.768 --> 07:58.641
so could I please switch
to the afternoon shift

07:58.642 --> 08:00.253
so I can take her
to the hospital?

08:00.288 --> 08:01.405
Of course.

08:01.836 --> 08:04.188
- Thank you, Mr. Ehlert.
- And you're working Easter.

08:07.169 --> 08:08.111
Okay.

08:09.850 --> 08:11.331
Got the new
Thanksgiving schedule.

08:12.733 --> 08:13.821
It's a little funky.

08:13.856 --> 08:16.105
We're gonna have to eat dessert
in the car on the way home,

08:16.140 --> 08:18.413
and there's one little patch
midday where I'm gonna have to

08:18.448 --> 08:21.939
be in two places at the same time,
but I think a test drive

08:21.974 --> 08:23.682
or a long bathroom break
will take care of it.

08:23.717 --> 08:26.339
So, yeah, I think
I pretty much nailed it.

08:26.932 --> 08:28.734
I don't see
the corn maze on here.

08:28.769 --> 08:31.775
It's only open in the morning,
then they're plowing it down.

08:32.317 --> 08:35.067
Brick, I'm gonna teach you

08:35.102 --> 08:37.424
a little phrase that I think
will come in very handy.

08:37.823 --> 08:39.437
I call it, "Oh, well."

08:41.041 --> 08:42.942
You know, we went to Disneyland
once before you were born.

08:42.977 --> 08:44.092
It was awesome.

08:44.916 --> 08:48.028
<i>Poor Brick. He was</i>
<i>the forgotten third child,</i>

08:48.063 --> 08:50.589
<i>but there was no way I could</i>
<i>go back in to Mr. Ehlert,</i>

08:50.624 --> 08:52.581
<i>and he was just gonna have</i>
<i>to understand that.</i>

08:53.546 --> 08:55.762
So now the kidney's coming in
on an earlier flight,

08:55.763 --> 08:57.324
which means I need to
switch to the morning shift

08:57.394 --> 09:00.692
so I can drive the kidney to
the hospital. It's an H.M.O.

09:02.416 --> 09:02.955
Okay.

09:03.337 --> 09:04.525
(door closes)
I did it.

09:05.506 --> 09:07.957
It was hard,
but I figured it out.

09:08.961 --> 09:11.635
I put the turkey in tonight.
We all set our alarms.

09:11.670 --> 09:14.545
We eat dinner at dawn.
I'll work until 11:00,

09:14.580 --> 09:16.207
then we record
the football game

09:16.242 --> 09:17.952
while we take Brick
to the corn maze,

09:17.987 --> 09:21.235
come home, clean up, get to
the mall, and for dessert,

09:21.631 --> 09:23.589
we split a dairy-free yogurt
at the food court.

09:24.611 --> 09:25.659
I have a coupon.

09:26.372 --> 09:28.358
That sounds like
the worst Thanksgiving ever.

09:28.393 --> 09:31.371
It really does.
Can I go to Brad's instead?

09:31.406 --> 09:34.040
I <i>really</i> should be with
my boyfriend on Thanksgiving.

09:34.424 --> 09:36.315
I really just care
about the corn maze.

09:36.938 --> 09:40.590
No. Thanksgiving is
about family.

09:40.625 --> 09:44.079
We have Aunt Edie and Aunt Ginny
coming over and Big Mike.

09:44.114 --> 09:45.333
Uh, maybe.

09:45.903 --> 09:46.373
Maybe?

09:46.408 --> 09:47.466
Probably not.

09:48.318 --> 09:50.825
I've asked you
to do one thing--

09:50.860 --> 09:52.090
Get your dad to come!

09:52.125 --> 09:55.782
Do you people realize what
I have gone through this week

09:55.817 --> 09:57.026
to make Thanksgiving
happen?

09:57.061 --> 09:58.518
- And now you guys don't appreciate--
- (horn honks)

09:58.553 --> 10:00.882
Oh, hey,
that's my ride.

10:01.193 --> 10:02.871
- (grunts)
- Hey.

10:03.611 --> 10:06.359
I figured once my friends came
to pick me up for snowmobiling,

10:06.394 --> 10:08.341
you'd be too embarrassed
to say no.

10:08.376 --> 10:09.796
You figured wrong.

10:13.207 --> 10:16.274
<i>No!</i>

10:16.309 --> 10:17.735
(tires squeal, vehicle departs)

10:19.278 --> 10:19.963
You know what?

10:20.755 --> 10:22.672
You don't care,
I don't care.

10:23.009 --> 10:23.752
Thanksgiving...

10:24.243 --> 10:25.740
(papers thud)
Canceled.

10:30.316 --> 10:31.621
Way to go, Brick.

10:37.575 --> 10:38.952
(sniffs)

10:39.961 --> 10:41.316
Where's the good smell?

10:42.263 --> 10:44.568
Wait. Did Mom really
cancel Thanksgiving?

10:44.801 --> 10:47.543
- Yeah. She's at work.
- Well, who's gonna make the turkey?

10:47.544 --> 10:49.271
Who's gonna bake
the frozen pies?

10:49.272 --> 10:51.049
Who's gonna open
the can of cranberry sauce?

10:51.365 --> 10:51.990
Not Mom.

10:52.165 --> 10:55.515
- Dude. That sucks.
- (can thuds)

10:55.785 --> 10:57.842
That's why we're gonna
pick up the slack

10:57.954 --> 11:00.946
and pull Thanksgiving
together <i>for</i> her.

11:00.957 --> 11:02.250
That sounds hard.

11:02.814 --> 11:05.016
It's not hard.
It's not hard at all.

11:06.055 --> 11:06.535
Watch.

11:14.596 --> 11:15.324
(liquid drips)

11:15.359 --> 11:17.333
FRANKIE: <i>So what if we had</i>
<i>no Thanksgiving?</i>

11:17.616 --> 11:19.945
<i>Just another day,</i>
<i>just another dinner.</i>

11:20.053 --> 11:22.405
<i>Not like anyone</i>
<i>cared anyway.</i>

11:22.440 --> 11:25.115
Guess who made yams
with little marshmallows

11:25.150 --> 11:26.410
for Thanksgiving dinner?

11:26.760 --> 11:29.679
Oh, my God. I forgot
to tell you. I canceled that.

11:30.442 --> 11:32.260
A phone call
would have been nice.

11:32.295 --> 11:32.869
(thud)

11:34.554 --> 11:35.297
(sighs)

11:35.606 --> 11:39.515
Seven hours? I'm gonna have
to barbecue this thing.

11:39.550 --> 11:40.178
While I do that,

11:40.213 --> 11:41.924
I want you to take your brother
to the corn maze.

11:41.959 --> 11:43.712
Oh, God. Do you just,
like, stay up late

11:43.747 --> 11:45.117
trying to figure out ways
to ruin my life?

11:45.152 --> 11:45.925
Yes.

11:47.778 --> 11:49.326
Oh, hey, can I invite Brad
over to help?

11:49.722 --> 11:51.260
It's Thanksgiving.
Won't his parents miss him?

11:51.702 --> 11:54.176
Oh, they're just so excited
he has a girlfriend.

11:55.359 --> 11:56.089
I could see that.

11:56.786 --> 11:58.482
I wonder what our kids
will look like.

11:58.517 --> 12:00.899
Mm. Depends what country
you get 'em from, right?

12:01.647 --> 12:02.225
Axl.

12:06.406 --> 12:08.173
Wow.
Now I get why they say

12:08.208 --> 12:10.129
the corn's as high
as an elephant's eye.

12:10.659 --> 12:11.900
(whispers)
<i>Elephant.</i>

12:11.935 --> 12:13.121
You know when I saw
an elephant?

12:13.472 --> 12:15.368
When Mom and Dad took us
to Africa on that safari.

12:15.769 --> 12:17.041
(normal voice)
They did not.

12:17.248 --> 12:18.494
Did, too.
I peed in the Nile.

12:22.168 --> 12:22.974
'Sup?

12:29.214 --> 12:29.728
Brick?

12:30.797 --> 12:32.131
<i>Brick?</i>

12:35.002 --> 12:35.484
Brick!

12:37.222 --> 12:39.844
<i>There we were,</i>
<i>stuck working on Thanksgiving,</i>

12:39.845 --> 12:42.103
<i>waiting for customers</i>
<i>who'd never come.</i>

12:42.138 --> 12:43.961
This is insane!

12:43.962 --> 12:47.301
Nobody's gonna buy a car today.
Why are we even here?

12:48.027 --> 12:51.359
Oh, my--I just want to go home,
eat with my family,

12:51.394 --> 12:54.549
enjoy some holiday savings
and a free hot pretzel.

12:54.891 --> 12:57.061
That is my right
as an American.

12:57.096 --> 12:58.575
He can't take that away.

12:58.682 --> 13:01.565
Frankie is right. We should say
something to <r. Ehlert.

13:02.423 --> 13:05.040
He can't say no to all of us.
Right?

13:05.075 --> 13:06.289
- That's right.
- Let's do this.

13:06.369 --> 13:06.899
Let's do it.

13:14.877 --> 13:15.564
Mr. Ehlert?

13:15.737 --> 13:18.043
(turns off TV)
(clears throat)

13:18.443 --> 13:19.657
We have something
to say.

13:20.977 --> 13:21.444
"We"?

13:24.604 --> 13:27.928
I guess it's I.
<i>I</i> have something to say.

13:29.033 --> 13:31.169
It's Thanksgiving,
Mr. Ehlert.

13:31.646 --> 13:34.868
We're supposed to be
with family, people we love,

13:34.903 --> 13:37.832
not people we sort of like
because we work with them.

13:41.334 --> 13:42.803
(voice breaking)
My wife left me.

13:42.838 --> 13:43.985
(crying)

13:45.490 --> 13:46.157
Oh.

13:48.014 --> 13:48.783
Brick?

13:50.398 --> 13:51.213
Brick.

13:55.409 --> 13:57.797
Hey, have you seen
a little kid about...

13:59.282 --> 13:59.882
This tall?

13:59.917 --> 14:02.403
I lost my little brother,
you know.

14:02.438 --> 14:06.103
I lost my little brother
in the corn maze in '53.

14:06.897 --> 14:08.566
When the wind
rustles the leaves,

14:09.128 --> 14:10.698
I can still
hear him calling.

14:12.616 --> 14:13.431
Brick!

14:14.901 --> 14:16.606
<i>Now it all made sense.</i>

14:16.641 --> 14:19.214
<i>Mr. Ehlert wanted to stay open</i>
<i>on Thanksgiving</i>

14:19.249 --> 14:21.301
<i>'cause he didn't want to face</i>
<i>the holidays alone.</i>

14:22.073 --> 14:23.317
Sit with me, Frances.

14:23.675 --> 14:26.157
Well, I-I did have
a kidney to pick up,

14:26.650 --> 14:27.713
but, uh...

14:28.868 --> 14:29.748
Okay.

14:31.394 --> 14:31.874
(door closes)

14:33.981 --> 14:35.271
(continues pouring)

14:37.512 --> 14:37.971
Brick!

14:39.516 --> 14:41.596
Brick! Brick!

14:42.058 --> 14:43.122
Where are you?

14:43.123 --> 14:45.270
Better find him
before they start plowin'.

14:45.781 --> 14:48.679
Can't see a little boy from
high up on the corn chopper.

14:49.907 --> 14:50.818
Brick!

14:51.621 --> 14:54.046
Brick! Brick!

14:54.369 --> 14:57.042
- (whistling)
- (crows cawing)

15:01.928 --> 15:03.514
Aunt Ginny and Aunt Edie
are here.

15:03.549 --> 15:04.050
(doorbell rings)

15:04.085 --> 15:06.247
Great.
Maybe they can help.

15:06.442 --> 15:07.849
- (both snoring)
FRANKIE: <i>Aunt Ginny and Aunt Edie</i>

15:07.884 --> 15:10.106
<i>haven't been able to help</i>
<i>since 1978.</i>

15:15.104 --> 15:16.431
(singsong voice)
Happy Thanksgiving!

15:16.466 --> 15:17.872
(squeals)

15:19.563 --> 15:21.072
It's my boyfriend!

15:21.535 --> 15:24.188
I made you this centerpiece
from the bounties of nature.

15:24.671 --> 15:27.246
Oh, God.
You're so romantic.

15:28.254 --> 15:29.268
P.S., Mr. Heck,

15:29.303 --> 15:31.908
there's a strange man
parked in front of your house.

15:37.486 --> 15:40.052
<i>(male announcer calling</i>
<i>sports game indistinctly)</i>

15:43.035 --> 15:44.229
Hey, Dad.
What are you doing?

15:49.213 --> 15:51.233
Just listening
to the game.

15:52.276 --> 15:53.580
You drove across town
for that?

15:54.163 --> 15:56.033
Reception's
better over here.

15:56.829 --> 16:01.054
Plus I heard someone
threw a bread maker out

16:01.089 --> 16:01.986
in this neighborhood.

16:02.951 --> 16:05.620
Well, as long as you're here,
you might as well come in.

16:06.213 --> 16:07.470
We're barbecuing
a whole turkey.

16:07.505 --> 16:09.084
I don't want to be a bother.

16:09.119 --> 16:11.984
You're not a bother, Dad.
I want you to come in.

16:16.691 --> 16:18.003
Please.
I'm begging you.

16:19.257 --> 16:20.759
Thanksgiving wouldn't be
the same without you.

16:20.794 --> 16:22.803
We wouldn't know what to do
if you didn't come.

16:22.929 --> 16:25.021
<i>Yep,</i>
<i>no stopping tradition.</i>

16:26.020 --> 16:26.911
<i>(indistinct speaking stops)</i>

16:28.797 --> 16:30.717
Guess I can listen
to this inside.

16:31.959 --> 16:33.200
(door opens)

16:35.276 --> 16:36.018
Brick!

16:36.769 --> 16:37.875
Brick! Hey!

16:37.910 --> 16:39.275
Oh, my God!
Please help me find my brother!

16:39.333 --> 16:42.160
- He's lost, and I'm so scared!
- Um, what's he wearing?

16:42.195 --> 16:44.767
Uh, he's got, like,
a green jacket and a yellow hat,

16:44.802 --> 16:47.897
and oh, my God,
he's dressed like corn.

16:48.121 --> 16:49.689
We are never gonna
find him in here!

16:50.150 --> 16:50.728
BRICK: Hi.

16:51.157 --> 16:53.226
Brick! Oh, my God.

16:54.020 --> 16:55.205
I'm never letting you
out of my sight, okay?

16:55.240 --> 16:57.913
Never, ever, ever, never,
ever again, all right?

16:59.587 --> 17:00.247
'Sup?

17:02.022 --> 17:02.880
(groans)

17:03.682 --> 17:05.517
(both laughing)

17:06.862 --> 17:09.944
You know what, Frances?
Go home.

17:10.902 --> 17:13.001
Go be with
your perfect family.

17:13.472 --> 17:14.349
Perfect?

17:16.055 --> 17:19.117
My son
wanted to leave me

17:19.153 --> 17:22.119
and spend Thanksgiving
with his friends.

17:22.155 --> 17:23.021
- No!
- Yeah.

17:23.089 --> 17:27.617
And don't even get me started
on my husband and his dad. Ohh.

17:28.015 --> 17:29.895
(whirring)

17:29.963 --> 17:31.325
(turns off saw)

17:32.589 --> 17:33.805
Grandpa Big Mike!

17:34.239 --> 17:36.136
- Boys!
- How was the corn maze?

17:36.171 --> 17:39.213
- Axl hugged me.
- Oh, shut up, dweeb.

17:39.870 --> 17:41.209
(whispers) I love you.
I love you so much.

17:42.040 --> 17:43.385
You know what,
Mr. Ehlert?

17:43.495 --> 17:45.297
I can c-call you that,
right, mr. Ehlert?

17:45.332 --> 17:46.010
Mm.

17:46.512 --> 17:48.298
(whispers)
I used to be scared of you.

17:49.222 --> 17:49.948
(normal voice)
I was.

17:50.016 --> 17:52.264
But you're just a big,
old teddy bear, right?

17:52.919 --> 17:55.333
Marcy used to call me
her teddy bear.

17:56.821 --> 17:59.593
Damn shame she couldn't get
over me working Thanksgiving.

18:01.049 --> 18:01.828
Wait.

18:03.405 --> 18:04.104
Hold on.

18:05.362 --> 18:06.270
Are you kidding me?

18:07.535 --> 18:11.058
I thought you were working today
because your wife left you,

18:11.093 --> 18:15.432
but your wife left you
because you're working today?

18:15.467 --> 18:17.891
Kept saying, "You can't
keep the dealership open!

18:18.452 --> 18:21.071
Your only daughter's
coming in from Hawaii."

18:22.636 --> 18:25.165
She can't tell <i>me</i>
what to do.

18:26.312 --> 18:28.568
Oh, my God!

18:29.420 --> 18:33.806
How dare you make me
waste my Thanksgiving

18:33.841 --> 18:35.573
feeling sorry for you?

18:35.864 --> 18:37.443
You don't deserve
my sorry.

18:37.709 --> 18:40.226
You know who deserves
my sorry? Me.

18:41.008 --> 18:41.985
I'm going home.

18:43.058 --> 18:45.899
And fire me,
don't fire me,

18:45.934 --> 18:46.873
I don't care.

18:49.107 --> 18:51.507
But if you're on the fence,
don't fire me.

18:51.542 --> 18:53.356
(snoring)

18:54.486 --> 18:55.326
(sighs)

18:57.182 --> 18:57.808
(door opens)

18:59.082 --> 19:00.445
FRANKIE:
Thanks for the ride, Bob!

19:00.976 --> 19:02.512
She's here.
Let's surprise her.

19:03.701 --> 19:06.544
(keys jangling,
doorknob rattling)

19:19.165 --> 19:20.349
ALL: Surprise!

19:20.384 --> 19:22.292
(gasps) Ohh!

19:23.055 --> 19:24.256
Happy Thanksgiving, honey.

19:25.480 --> 19:28.795
<i>They</i> did <i>care.</i>
<i>They</i> are <i>perfect.</i>

19:29.712 --> 19:30.413
Come sit down.

19:30.448 --> 19:31.815
(singsong voice)
Sit down, sit down.

19:33.078 --> 19:35.965
Oh, and this all looks
so yummy.

19:36.874 --> 19:38.412
- Hey. Mm.
- Mm.

19:39.263 --> 19:40.496
Frankie, you forgot your...

19:41.669 --> 19:42.833
"Canceled dinner"?
(purse thuds)

19:43.946 --> 19:45.842
God, this is like high school
all over again.

19:45.877 --> 19:48.891
Oh, no, Bob.
They surprised me...

19:48.926 --> 19:52.458
My wonderful, sweet family.

19:55.415 --> 19:58.733
I am so sorry
I yelled at you.

19:58.768 --> 20:01.327
- We're sorry, too, honey.
- We love you, Mom.

20:01.724 --> 20:02.814
I love you, too.

20:04.315 --> 20:05.830
(voice breaking)
I got extra yams in the car...

20:06.562 --> 20:08.026
with little marshmallows.

20:10.766 --> 20:11.335
(door closes)

20:11.706 --> 20:12.858
Here comes the gravy.

20:19.204 --> 20:21.899
I'm--I'm gonna go cry
in the toilet.

20:21.934 --> 20:23.008
Mike, come hold my hair.

20:23.043 --> 20:25.125
<i>And that's the last thing</i>
<i>I remembered.</i>

20:26.213 --> 20:27.619
<i>And though I didn't</i>
<i>make it to the mall,</i>

20:27.654 --> 20:30.148
- <i>I was there in spirit.</i>
MIKE: Frankie?

20:33.993 --> 20:35.521
Oh, what did I buy?

20:36.376 --> 20:38.629
Power sander, 80% off.

20:40.323 --> 20:42.501
Did we make
the houseware sale on time?

20:43.073 --> 20:44.516
We got the bacon press.

20:45.248 --> 20:46.750
Good girl.

20:47.691 --> 20:48.776
FRANKIE:
<i>Thanksgiving's the time</i>

20:48.811 --> 20:50.702
<i>you appreciate</i>
<i>your family the most.</i>

20:50.737 --> 20:53.617
<i>But the one Thanksgiving</i>
<i>I didn't spend with my family,</i>

20:54.073 --> 20:56.160
<i>I appreciated them</i>
<i>more than ever.</i>

20:56.577 --> 21:00.632
See, kids? Let this be a lesson.
Drinking is not cool.

21:01.090 --> 21:03.207
Mike, I told them
I had the flu.

21:04.461 --> 21:07.457
See, kids,
lying is also not cool.

21:09.554 --> 21:13.702
Honey, why don't we close
this up just a little bit?

21:14.090 --> 21:15.338
There you go.
We have company.

21:16.009 --> 21:17.883
Okay. Night, honey.
Happy Thanksgiving.

21:19.550 --> 21:20.252
(door closes)
