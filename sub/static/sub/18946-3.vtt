00:06.040 --> 00:09.079
Time to destination - two hours.

00:09.080 --> 00:11.239
And for those of you
on your travels this weekend,

00:11.240 --> 00:15.519
a piece of Mozart to get your holiday
off to a relaxing start.

00:23.199 --> 00:24.759

00:28.760 --> 00:31.158
Everyone, I'm hanging up Mummy's wedding outfit.

00:31.160 --> 00:32.319
Please do not get it dirty.

00:32.320 --> 00:34.999
Can't see out the window.
Hang it over Molly's side.

00:35.000 --> 00:36.959
Hang it over Benji's side.

00:36.960 --> 00:38.959
Any more arguing, and me
and Daddy will go to France

00:38.960 --> 00:41.359
and leave you in the house on your own.
Is that what you want?

00:41.359 --> 00:42.918
Yeah!

00:42.920 --> 00:44.558
Mummy, you haven't strapped me in yet.

00:44.560 --> 00:46.598
Any chance of some help, Lee?

00:46.600 --> 00:49.479
And holiday over.

Oh, we love that song.

That's not a song. It's Hannibal
Lecter's shopping list.

01:38.240 --> 01:40.278
Oh, great, you let him bring
his sound-effects box.

01:40.280 --> 01:42.118
Just what a long journey with kids needs -

01:42.120 --> 01:44.400
some spare noise in case of awkward silences.

01:45.479 --> 01:47.400
Keeps them quiet.

01:48.960 --> 01:50.759
Yeah, it's doing an excellent job(!)

01:50.759 --> 01:52.399
Why are you being such an old misery guts?

01:52.400 --> 01:54.598
Because you made me spend
the last half-hour strapping

01:54.599 --> 01:56.558
those bikes to the roof.
What have you been doing?

01:56.560 --> 01:58.278
Packing my clothes, packing your clothes,

01:58.280 --> 02:00.918
packing the kids' clothes, wrapping
my cousin's wedding present,

02:00.920 --> 02:03.599
putting everything in the boot,
bathing the kids, feeding the kids,

02:03.599 --> 02:05.799
getting the travel mattresses
down from the loft,

02:05.799 --> 02:07.998
finding all the passports...

02:08.000 --> 02:09.360
All right, one-all.

02:11.360 --> 02:12.558
I'm bored.

02:12.560 --> 02:13.959
Why don't we play I Spy?

02:13.960 --> 02:15.639
Hurray!

02:15.639 --> 02:17.639
Not I Spy. The twins are too young.

02:17.639 --> 02:20.038
We spent the whole journey
to the Cotswolds trying to think of

02:20.039 --> 02:22.878
words beginning with the number three.

02:22.879 --> 02:25.759
I spy with my little eye
something beginning with B.

02:25.759 --> 02:27.478
B for boring.

02:27.479 --> 02:29.280
You can't spy an adjective, Charlie.

02:31.039 --> 02:32.598
It's best he learns.

02:32.599 --> 02:35.879
Oh, I agree. I just can't believe
you know what an adjective is.

02:44.280 --> 02:45.759
How long to the ferry?

02:45.759 --> 02:48.679
- Two hours.
- How long is two hours?

02:48.680 --> 02:49.878
About an hour.

02:49.879 --> 02:51.598
I don't want it to be an hour.

02:51.599 --> 02:54.079
- All right, half an hour.
- How long is that?

02:54.079 --> 02:56.240
- About ten minutes.
- Hurray!

02:57.599 --> 03:00.038
Are you sure we're going to get there on time?

03:00.039 --> 03:02.679
Fine. Sat nav says we're arriving at 6:30.

03:02.680 --> 03:04.679
Last check-in isn't until 7:15.

03:04.680 --> 03:07.038
- How do you know?
- I read it on the website.

03:07.039 --> 03:11.799
"All vehicles under 1.85 metres must
check in by 7:15 at the latest."

03:11.800 --> 03:13.799
But we're way over that.

03:13.800 --> 03:16.998
No, we're not. This vehicle
is only about 1.6 metres high.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.959
But what about the bikes on the roof?

03:19.960 --> 03:22.679
They don't count the bikes
towards the height of the vehicle.

03:22.680 --> 03:24.598
Course they do.

03:24.599 --> 03:26.919
No, they don't. If I was wearing a top hat,

03:26.920 --> 03:28.838
that wouldn't make me six foot six, would it?

03:28.840 --> 03:31.038
No, but you wouldn't wear it
through a doorway that said

03:31.039 --> 03:32.998
- maximum height six foot, would you?
- I could duck.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.799
Oh, great(!) Well, when we get to the ferry,

03:34.800 --> 03:37.639
just set the roof rack
to duck, and we'll be fine.

03:37.639 --> 03:39.118
So what if they do count the bikes?

03:39.120 --> 03:41.399
What time is the latest check-in
for the higher vehicles?

03:41.400 --> 03:43.598
I didn't read that bit, did I?
I'm not Eddie Stobart.

03:43.599 --> 03:46.840
Oh, great(!) I'm phoning
the ferry company and checking.

03:49.120 --> 03:51.079
Does that make any other noises, Charlie?

03:52.639 --> 03:57.239
Nobody is guessing! Something beginning with B!

03:57.240 --> 04:00.679
I know - is it big bag
of blackcurrant berry-tastic

04:00.680 --> 04:02.519
blood sugar-boosting bon-bons?

04:02.520 --> 04:04.239
- Hurray!
- Yeah!

04:04.240 --> 04:05.718
What are you giving them sweets for?

04:05.719 --> 04:07.959
Keep them quiet whilst we make this call.

04:07.960 --> 04:10.838
Oh, yeah, because nothing keeps
a child calm quite like a Haribo(!)

04:10.840 --> 04:12.359
Should have bought the Sunny Delight,

04:12.360 --> 04:14.318
then we really could have had some peace.

04:14.319 --> 04:15.645
- Just one each.
- And don't drop any.

04:15.669 --> 04:17.158
Yeah, be careful.

04:17.160 --> 04:19.478
Last time I dropped a jelly ring,
I knelt down to pick it up,

04:19.480 --> 04:22.278
ended up accidentally proposing to your mother.

04:22.279 --> 04:24.079
Welcome to Channel Ferries.

04:24.079 --> 04:27.959
Please use your keypad to type
your ten-digit booking reference,

04:27.959 --> 04:30.278
or, if you are a premium ticket holder,

04:30.279 --> 04:33.119
press star now to be put
straight through to an operator.

04:33.120 --> 04:34.718
You did book premium, didn't you?

04:34.720 --> 04:37.439
No chance. Not paying an extra 100 quid just for

04:37.439 --> 04:39.678
a cup of tea and some thicker toilet paper.

04:39.680 --> 04:41.558
And for a fully supervised kids' play section

04:41.560 --> 04:43.119
with the chance to meet Peppa Pig.

04:43.120 --> 04:46.678
For that money, I'd want the chance
to roast Peppa Pig on a spit.

04:46.680 --> 04:49.278
Thank you. Please hold.

04:49.279 --> 04:51.798
And with premium tickets you
get access to the lounge,

04:51.800 --> 04:53.999
but instead we're going to be
hanging around the docks.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.439
Yeah, that's right, hanging
round the docks, surrounded by

04:56.439 --> 04:58.838
prostitutes and one-eyed
sailors playing the accordion.

04:58.840 --> 05:00.598
Er, what's an accordion?

05:00.600 --> 05:03.160
- It's a musical instrument, sweetheart.
- Oh.

05:04.240 --> 05:06.800
Why didn't he ask what a prostitute was?

05:11.399 --> 05:12.798
Has it been two hours?

05:12.800 --> 05:15.038
Something beginning with B!

05:15.040 --> 05:16.238
Bird.

05:16.240 --> 05:18.279
I can't see a bird, stupid.

05:19.639 --> 05:20.879
Yeah, I just shot it.

05:22.240 --> 05:23.838
Who wants to play on Daddy's phone?

05:23.839 --> 05:25.119
Me!

05:25.120 --> 05:27.319
Lee! Don't want them just staring at a screen

05:27.319 --> 05:28.639
and playing games all journey.

05:28.639 --> 05:30.918
- Mummy?
- Yes, sweetheart?

05:30.920 --> 05:32.279
What's a prostitute?

05:34.959 --> 05:36.600
Take turns and don't drop it.

05:37.759 --> 05:39.959
And don't Google what a prostitute is.

05:41.680 --> 05:43.399
When we get through, let me do the talking.

05:43.399 --> 05:44.798
Why?

05:44.800 --> 05:47.278
Because I made the booking.
Besides, they'll put us through

05:47.279 --> 05:49.278
to some thicko who doesn't know what he's doing.

05:49.279 --> 05:52.199
I can see why that's your department.

05:52.199 --> 05:54.399
Hello. Channel Ferries. George speaking.

05:54.399 --> 05:56.678
Daddy said you're a thicko.

05:56.680 --> 05:59.158
I don't know who said that. Haven't got kids.

05:59.159 --> 06:01.759
Really? According to the details
on your booking, sir,

06:01.759 --> 06:03.399
you've got three children.

06:03.399 --> 06:05.879
Well, I didn't have before you put me on hold.

06:05.879 --> 06:07.598
Apologies about the delay, sir.

06:07.600 --> 06:09.199
What can I do for you today?

06:09.199 --> 06:11.158
Right. What it is, is this -

06:11.160 --> 06:15.079
we are driving in a vehicle
that is under 1.85 metres.

06:15.079 --> 06:18.079
- OK.
- And my question is this -

06:18.079 --> 06:19.879
if we've got three bikes on the roof,

06:19.879 --> 06:21.639
does that make the vehicle higher?

06:24.759 --> 06:25.918
Hello?

06:25.920 --> 06:29.639
Sorry, I'm still here. I'm not
sure I understand your question.

06:29.639 --> 06:31.199
Well, it's fairly straightforward.

06:31.199 --> 06:33.879
Well, yes, but it's so straightforward,

06:33.879 --> 06:36.319
I'm assuming I'm not properly following you.

06:38.120 --> 06:40.158
Could you just answer the question, please?

06:40.159 --> 06:43.718
You're asking me if you take
your vehicle and attach

06:43.720 --> 06:48.278
three other vehicles to the top
of it, will that make it higher?

06:48.279 --> 06:49.600
Yes.

06:51.920 --> 06:54.119
Why do you keep pausing?

06:54.120 --> 06:56.759
Sorry, I'm just wondering
if it's a trick question.

06:56.759 --> 06:58.718
It's not a trick question.

06:58.720 --> 07:01.999
OK. Well, then, yes, sir,
it does make it higher.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.759
See, I told you.

07:03.759 --> 07:05.999
But the actual vehicle
ITSELF isn't higher, is it?

07:06.000 --> 07:09.559
Of course the vehicle itself
is still the same height, but the

07:09.560 --> 07:13.759
restrictions of what it can drive
under obviously then change,

07:13.759 --> 07:18.519
so therefore, the overall height
of your vehicle has changed.

07:18.519 --> 07:20.999
But if I was wearing a top hat,
it wouldn't make me six foot six,

07:21.000 --> 07:23.879
- would it?
- We have no restrictions on headgear, sir.

07:23.879 --> 07:26.999
You're completely free to wear
whatever you like on the ferry.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.439
I'm just making a point.

07:28.439 --> 07:31.399
I'm not actually wearing a top hat,
otherwise I wouldn't fit in the car.

07:31.399 --> 07:35.360
And you've rather elegantly made
my point by saying so, sir.

07:36.879 --> 07:39.399
So you're saying that we are over 1.85 metres?

07:39.399 --> 07:46.158
Yes, unless they're very, very tiny
bicycles, or extremely heavy ones.

07:46.159 --> 07:47.759
Did I pay extra for the jokes?

07:47.759 --> 07:50.199
Oh, I doubt it.

07:50.199 --> 07:53.238
- So, what time is final check-in?
- As an oversize vehicle,

07:53.240 --> 07:55.678
it's half an hour earlier
than regulation vehicles,

07:55.680 --> 07:59.079
so 6:45pm at the absolute latest.

07:59.079 --> 08:01.918
But that only gives us 15 minutes to spare.

08:01.920 --> 08:03.838
Is there anything else I can help you with?

08:03.839 --> 08:06.238
What do you mean, anything else?
You didn't help us with THIS.

08:06.240 --> 08:08.079
OK. Well, you have a nice journey, sir.

08:08.079 --> 08:10.038
- Yeah, we won't.
- Goodbye, sir.

08:10.040 --> 08:12.119
Yeah, see you. Oh, and one other thing, George.

08:12.120 --> 08:13.158
Yes, sir?

08:13.160 --> 08:15.360
- I did call you a thicko.
- Well, if you...

08:16.560 --> 08:18.399
Thank goodness I let you do the talking(!)

08:18.399 --> 08:21.559
Keep guessing, Mummy. It begins with B.

08:21.560 --> 08:24.519
- Bird-brain, buffoon, butthead.
- Don't start.

08:24.519 --> 08:26.918
This is your fault for making me
strap those bikes to the roof.

08:26.920 --> 08:28.439
Who the hell takes bikes to a wedding?

08:28.439 --> 08:31.478
It's for the day after the wedding,
and it's what people do in France.

08:31.480 --> 08:33.719
Yeah, you can't move
for all the French on bicycles with

08:33.720 --> 08:36.359
strings of onions round their necks,
wearing stripy T-shirts,

08:36.360 --> 08:39.799
eating croissants and cheating
on their wives with snails.

08:41.240 --> 08:43.759
What kind of person gets
married in France, anyway?

08:43.759 --> 08:45.999
The kind of person who marries a Frenchman.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.838
Well, what kind of person marries a Frenchman?

08:47.840 --> 08:51.359
I don't know, the kind of person
who likes nice cheese and good sex.

08:51.360 --> 08:53.719
Well, I've always thought
a quickie and a Dairylea triangle

08:53.720 --> 08:54.840
are very underrated.

08:56.320 --> 08:58.119
We cannot miss this ferry.

08:58.120 --> 09:00.438
Perhaps you should get
on the roof and start pedalling.

09:00.440 --> 09:02.279
Mummy, I feel sick.

09:05.559 --> 09:07.359
Benji's eaten them all.

09:07.360 --> 09:08.798
I said one each.

09:08.799 --> 09:10.879
I thought you meant one PACKET each.

09:12.279 --> 09:13.479
Hang on.

09:13.480 --> 09:15.839
If we take this exit in 100 yards,
I think there's a short cut.

09:15.840 --> 09:16.958
We'll avoid the traffic.

09:16.960 --> 09:18.639
But the sat nav is saying stay on this road,

09:18.639 --> 09:19.958
and they factor in the traffic.

09:19.960 --> 09:21.558
- This one doesn't.
- Why not?

09:21.559 --> 09:23.039
You had to pay extra for that.

09:24.879 --> 09:28.240
Don't tell me - was it described
as the premium service?

09:30.080 --> 09:31.639
50 yards to this turn-off.

09:31.639 --> 09:33.879
- Don't take the exit.
- It'll be quicker.

09:33.879 --> 09:36.438
The sat nav says we're going to get
there with 15 minutes to spare.

09:36.440 --> 09:37.719
Just stay on this road.

09:37.720 --> 09:39.120
What if the traffic doesn't clear?

09:41.600 --> 09:43.239
20 yards.

09:43.240 --> 09:45.519
I think it IS clearing. Don't do it.

09:46.919 --> 09:48.119
Ten yards.

09:48.120 --> 09:51.558
Stay on this road, Lee. Don't take the exit.

09:51.559 --> 09:52.679
OK.

09:54.679 --> 09:56.198
Really need to catch this ferry.

09:56.200 --> 09:57.879
I'm taking the exit.

09:57.879 --> 10:00.039
Noooooo!

10:02.440 --> 10:04.078
See, we're moving much faster now.

10:04.080 --> 10:07.318
Yeah, perfect(!) Shame we're heading
in completely the wrong direction.

10:07.320 --> 10:08.519
Says who?

10:08.519 --> 10:10.759
Make a U-turn where possible.

10:10.759 --> 10:12.839
Was that directions or marriage counselling?

10:12.840 --> 10:14.278
Are we there yet?

10:14.279 --> 10:16.038
- No.
- I'm bored.

10:16.039 --> 10:18.119
Stop moaning or we're turning
this car right round.

10:18.120 --> 10:19.639
That's what we want you to do.

10:19.639 --> 10:22.359
The sat nav hasn't reconfigured yet.
It doesn't know what I'm up to.

10:22.360 --> 10:24.359
No-one knows what you're up to.

10:24.360 --> 10:25.999
Don't worry. There's a turning up here.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.879
Turn back now.

10:27.879 --> 10:29.918
Make a U-turn where possible.

10:29.919 --> 10:32.038
Here it is.

10:32.039 --> 10:33.559
This is a field, you moron!

10:36.840 --> 10:38.480
Is this France?

10:47.960 --> 10:50.038
Don't suppose you fancy
giving us a push, do you?

10:50.039 --> 10:52.479
Yeah, but let's get out of this field first.

10:52.480 --> 10:54.559
I'll do it when we get to the harbour.

10:55.799 --> 10:57.879
- Maybe I'll do the pushing.
- Good idea.

10:57.879 --> 11:00.919
If I get out now, I might
start running and never stop.

11:05.879 --> 11:08.278
Push harder!

11:08.279 --> 11:10.399
You reverse harder.

11:10.399 --> 11:12.918
I don't want to get mud all over you.

11:12.919 --> 11:15.200
Just rev it, it's going nowhere near me.

11:18.440 --> 11:20.120
Oh, great(!)

11:32.399 --> 11:34.120
Make a U-turn where possible.

11:35.799 --> 11:37.838
That sat nav will kick in in a minute.

11:37.840 --> 11:39.678
What was wrong with good old-fashioned maps?

11:39.679 --> 11:41.119
Well, there's one in the side pocket

11:41.120 --> 11:43.879
if you're feeling confident, Catweazle.

11:43.879 --> 11:46.918
This is of Inverness and the Scottish Highlands.

11:46.919 --> 11:49.078
Well, don't worry. Keep driving for a bit.

11:49.080 --> 11:50.318
It'll probably come in useful.

11:50.320 --> 11:51.999
If we miss this ferry, it'll be your fault.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.359
Well, don't worry, Miss Perfect.

11:53.360 --> 11:55.599
If we miss the ferry, you can
just walk across the water.

11:55.600 --> 11:58.318
Keep guessing, Mummy. It begins with B.

11:58.320 --> 11:59.799
Still feel sick.

12:01.039 --> 12:02.759
Is it bath? B for bath?

12:02.759 --> 12:05.038
Stop being silly. Mummy, tell him.

12:05.039 --> 12:06.119
Stop arguing in the back.

12:06.120 --> 12:07.720
Stop arguing in the front.

12:09.600 --> 12:11.918
Hang on, look. The sat nav's reconfiguring.

12:11.919 --> 12:13.879
I really feel sick.

12:13.879 --> 12:16.318
Just try and think of something else, Benji.

12:16.320 --> 12:18.599
Yeah, think about what great
fun you'll have on the ferry,

12:18.600 --> 12:20.360
bobbing about on the ocean waves.

12:21.679 --> 12:23.918
Actually, stop thinking about that.
It'll be very calm.

12:23.919 --> 12:26.078
- You'll have lots of fun.
- Is there a play area?

12:26.080 --> 12:28.558
Yes, in premium, but Daddy didn't pay for that.

12:28.559 --> 12:31.958
Maybe you can stand outside and watch
the other children playing.

12:31.960 --> 12:34.318
Oh, Daddy, it's not fair.

12:34.320 --> 12:36.719
Well done. Tell them
about the time I shot the puppy.

12:36.720 --> 12:39.879
I really don't feel well.

12:39.879 --> 12:42.359
- Can you slow down on the bends?
- You're making him worse.

12:42.360 --> 12:45.318
Continue straight ahead for half a mile.

12:45.320 --> 12:48.080
There you go. Told you. It's reconfigured.

12:49.360 --> 12:51.440
Who's the daddy? Daddy's the daddy.

12:52.440 --> 12:54.399
- Lee.
- What?

12:54.399 --> 12:57.239
The sat nav says we're going
to get there at ten to seven.

12:57.240 --> 12:59.919
Your short cut means we're going
to miss the last check-in.

13:02.120 --> 13:03.678
Don't worry. I can still get us there.

13:03.679 --> 13:05.639
- I can make up the time.
- Oh, it's fine, kids.

13:05.639 --> 13:08.438
Daddy knows a wormhole
in the fabric of space and time.

13:08.440 --> 13:10.159
Hurray!

13:11.960 --> 13:13.318
Oh, Mummy, I'm not well.

13:13.320 --> 13:14.599
Maybe we should stop.

13:14.600 --> 13:18.119
Slow down, speed up, stop -
this is like when we're in bed.

13:18.120 --> 13:19.838
I feel sick.

13:19.840 --> 13:22.479
Yeah, that one rings a bell, too.

13:22.480 --> 13:25.399
Keep guessing, Mummy.
Something that begins with B.

13:25.399 --> 13:30.479
Blood, bones, bandages, brutally
bludgeoned brain, bashing, burial.

13:30.480 --> 13:32.038
I can't see those things.

13:32.039 --> 13:33.999
Keep watching, darling.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.639
Stop the car.

13:35.639 --> 13:39.558
Look, Benji, do you FEEL sick
or are you actually going to BE sick?

13:39.559 --> 13:40.879
Benji?

13:42.919 --> 13:45.119
Please tell me that was a sound effect.

13:45.120 --> 13:47.119
Mummy, it went all over me.

13:47.120 --> 13:48.678
Oh, God.

13:48.679 --> 13:50.158
It's OK, sweetheart.

13:50.159 --> 13:51.840
Is that it, Benji, or is there any more?

13:55.120 --> 13:56.639
Thanks for that, Lee.

13:56.639 --> 13:58.239
At least he missed your wedding outfit.

13:58.240 --> 13:59.798
I am thrilled to be doing this journey

13:59.799 --> 14:02.438
with someone who's so upbeat.

14:02.440 --> 14:03.678
Any more, Benji?

14:03.679 --> 14:06.839
Don't keep encouraging him. Stop the car.

14:06.840 --> 14:08.359
I can't stop the car.

14:08.360 --> 14:09.759
Oh, I'm sorry, Keanu Reeves,

14:09.759 --> 14:12.078
I forgot we were in the middle
of a remake of Speed.

14:12.080 --> 14:13.999
We have to make up time, not lose it.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.119
You have to stop! The smell is unbearable.

14:16.120 --> 14:17.399
I'll open the window.

14:19.480 --> 14:20.918
It's freezing!

14:20.919 --> 14:23.879
Well, you've got a choice - to be
freezing cold or the smell of vomit.

14:23.879 --> 14:26.278
If that doesn't sum up marriage,
I don't know what does.

14:26.279 --> 14:28.438
Close it.

14:28.440 --> 14:30.278
Stop the car.

14:30.279 --> 14:33.239
We can't stop the car cos
we'll miss the ferry, and you can't

14:33.240 --> 14:36.119
miss the ferry cos you'll miss
your cousin's wedding, remember?

14:36.120 --> 14:37.519
I wish I'd missed ours.

14:37.519 --> 14:38.879
Shall I stop the car, then?

14:38.879 --> 14:40.798
No, just carry on.

14:40.799 --> 14:43.479
I'll see if I can hold my breath
for the next ten miles.

14:43.480 --> 14:45.120
Maybe I will slow down, then.

14:47.120 --> 14:49.759
We'll clean up once we've checked in.
We'll find a bathroom.

14:49.759 --> 14:51.759
I'll tell you where they have nice bathrooms.

14:51.759 --> 14:54.278
Don't tell me. Is it by any chance
the premium lounge?

14:54.279 --> 14:55.879
- Yes, it bloody is.
- It's a waste of money.

14:55.879 --> 14:57.399
I'll tell you what's a waste of money -

14:57.399 --> 14:59.719
buying five tickets to France,
then missing the ferry to go

14:59.720 --> 15:01.599
on a magical mystery tour of rural England.

15:01.600 --> 15:03.078
All right. We're all in the same boat.

15:03.080 --> 15:05.080
No, we're not. That's the problem.

15:06.240 --> 15:09.359
Oh, great(!) Now the sat nav says
we've lost two more minutes.

15:09.360 --> 15:11.119
- I don't believe this.
- Oh, well, don't worry.

15:11.120 --> 15:13.239
When you divorce me, you can
get on the ferry on your own

15:13.240 --> 15:15.839
as much as you like with your precious bikes.

15:15.840 --> 15:17.639
That's it.

15:17.639 --> 15:19.838
What, have you got your lawyer on speed dial?

15:19.840 --> 15:23.158
We phone Channel Ferries again
and book you in as a foot passenger.

15:23.159 --> 15:25.359
Then when we get there, you
take the bikes off the roof

15:25.360 --> 15:27.918
and wheel them on, and I'll drive
the car on, which will now be less

15:27.919 --> 15:31.278
than 1.85 metres high, so we're
all eligible for the later check-in.

15:31.279 --> 15:33.838
So instead of being... seven minutes late,

15:33.840 --> 15:36.559
we're now going to be... eight minutes early.

15:38.720 --> 15:41.158
I wondered how long it'd take
you to work that out.

15:41.159 --> 15:42.999
Welcome to Channel Ferries.

15:43.000 --> 15:46.239
Please use your keypad to type
your ten-digit booking reference,

15:46.240 --> 15:48.639
or, if you are a premium ticket hol...

15:51.440 --> 15:53.519
So why do I have to be
the one that looks like a lunatic,

15:53.519 --> 15:54.959
wheeling three bikes on by meself?

15:54.960 --> 15:56.918
I'm going to look like me
family have disowned me.

15:56.919 --> 15:58.479
Well, it'll be good practice.

15:58.480 --> 16:00.918
And now we've got extra time,
we can stop and clean up this mess.

16:00.919 --> 16:03.519
We're not even thinking about stopping
until I've spoken to them

16:03.519 --> 16:04.639
and I know we can change it.

16:04.639 --> 16:07.239
You're not speaking to them again.
What if it's the same person?

16:07.240 --> 16:09.038
It's not going to be the same person, is it?

16:09.039 --> 16:11.318
Hello. Channel Ferries. George speaking.

16:11.320 --> 16:12.759
How may I help you?

16:12.759 --> 16:15.999
- Hello again, George.
- Oh, it's you again, sir.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.078
Let me guess - you've called to ask

16:18.080 --> 16:21.159
whether your wing mirrors count
towards the width of the car.

16:22.840 --> 16:25.838
- Look, about earlier...
- We do have a strict policy

16:25.840 --> 16:29.438
of not tolerating abuse towards our staff, sir.

16:29.440 --> 16:31.158
I can't apologise enough.

16:31.159 --> 16:33.600
True, but you could make a start.

16:34.919 --> 16:37.519
I'm sorry. I am really sorry.

16:37.519 --> 16:41.639
Good, because we treat these
issues very seriously.

16:41.639 --> 16:42.960
And so do I.

16:45.080 --> 16:47.278
So, how may I help you this time, sir?

16:47.279 --> 16:49.558
Right, what it is, is this, George -

16:49.559 --> 16:52.078
I would like to change
one of our adult tickets to

16:52.080 --> 16:55.039
a foot passenger ticket carrying on three bikes.

16:56.240 --> 16:57.440
Please.

16:58.559 --> 17:00.480
Would that be possible, George?

17:02.039 --> 17:05.200
Of course. We strive to be
as flexible as possible.

17:06.358 --> 17:10.038
Oh, that is wonderful. Thank
you very much indeed.

17:10.039 --> 17:12.759
I can book you on for next Wednesday at 3pm.

17:14.480 --> 17:15.637
What about tonight?

17:15.640 --> 17:17.240
Tonight we're fully booked, sir.

17:19.559 --> 17:20.637
But the thing is,

17:20.640 --> 17:22.999
I'm not actually asking you
to book an extra passenger, am I?

17:23.000 --> 17:25.798
It's the same amount of passengers
I just won't be in the car.

17:25.799 --> 17:27.519
I understand, sir,

17:27.519 --> 17:31.919
but once the system is full, it
won't accept any new bookings.

17:31.920 --> 17:33.558
Must be something you can do.

17:33.559 --> 17:35.358
I'm afraid not.

17:35.359 --> 17:36.838
Oh, I'm sure there is.

17:36.839 --> 17:38.598
What do you suggest I do, sir?

17:38.599 --> 17:40.078
Well, seeing as you're so flexible,

17:40.079 --> 17:42.279
maybe you could take your ferry
and stick it up your...

17:44.519 --> 17:47.878
Like I said, sir, we don't
tolerate abuse against our staff,

17:47.880 --> 17:49.078
so I'll say goodbye.

17:49.079 --> 17:51.959
Wait, George, before you go, I want to apologise

17:51.960 --> 17:55.239
for my husband's attitude. I'm
afraid he has a certain condition,

17:55.240 --> 17:57.078
which makes him socially awkward.

17:57.079 --> 17:58.119
He's a knobhead.

17:59.319 --> 18:01.719
Yes, well, he is a little abrasive.

18:01.720 --> 18:03.598
You should try being married to him.

18:03.599 --> 18:05.118
That's a generous offer, madam,

18:05.119 --> 18:09.278
but I feel I've spent more than my fair
share of time with him already.

18:09.279 --> 18:10.878
Oh, George, what are you like?

18:10.880 --> 18:15.439
Well, you don't have to be crazy
to do my job, but it helps.

18:15.440 --> 18:16.959
Sounds like my marriage.

18:16.960 --> 18:19.038
At least I get to clock off in the evening.

18:19.039 --> 18:22.278
Oh, George. You know what? I like you.

18:22.279 --> 18:25.038
- You're funny.
- Thank you.

18:25.039 --> 18:27.679
I'm not changing your booking.

18:27.680 --> 18:30.999
Look - please, George, I'm begging you.

18:31.000 --> 18:34.358
My husband is a stupid, rude
idiot, and I'm sorry, OK?

18:34.359 --> 18:36.999
But if we don't get a later
check-in, we might miss this ferry,

18:37.000 --> 18:39.519
and I am maid of honour at my cousin's wedding.

18:39.519 --> 18:41.798
If you could find it in your heart to help us,

18:41.799 --> 18:44.318
I would be eternally grateful.

18:44.319 --> 18:49.638
The power to change our lives is in your hands.

18:49.640 --> 18:54.480
Please, George, help us. You're our only hope.

18:58.160 --> 19:01.118
Well, there might be one thing I could try.

19:01.119 --> 19:03.239
Anything. You can even put my husband

19:03.240 --> 19:05.439
in the hold with the bikes, if you like, George.

19:05.440 --> 19:08.999
Why not just put a rubber ring round me
and tow me along behind the boat?

19:09.000 --> 19:11.479
Is that a possibility, George?

19:11.480 --> 19:13.598
If you cancelled your existing booking,

19:13.599 --> 19:16.398
that would release five tickets
back into the system.

19:16.400 --> 19:19.159
You could then re-book them as one party of four

19:19.160 --> 19:21.919
and one foot passenger.

19:21.920 --> 19:23.558
That's a brilliant idea.

19:23.559 --> 19:26.278
- How come I was never offered that option?
- Sorry, sir,

19:26.279 --> 19:30.278
I was too busy tolerating
abuse to think creatively.

19:30.279 --> 19:33.038
I should warn you, though -
once your original tickets are

19:33.039 --> 19:38.759
cancelled, there's no 100% guarantee
that you'll be able to re-book them.

19:38.759 --> 19:39.838
What?

19:39.839 --> 19:43.318
We always have lots of people
waiting on standby at the terminal.

19:43.319 --> 19:46.398
What, so you're saying we could
lose our tickets altogether?

19:46.400 --> 19:48.679
Unless you re-book very quickly.

19:48.680 --> 19:50.358
And if we do re-book quickly?

19:50.359 --> 19:51.919
You'll probably be fine.

19:51.920 --> 19:54.679
- Probably.
- Yes, probably.

19:54.680 --> 19:56.159
I don't like that word.

19:56.160 --> 19:57.919
What word would you like?

19:57.920 --> 20:01.199
- "Definitely."
- OK, you'll definitely

20:01.200 --> 20:03.398
be probably fine.

20:03.400 --> 20:05.278
Are you deliberately trying to wind me up?

20:05.279 --> 20:08.038
No, sir, but given your previous attitude,

20:08.039 --> 20:11.119
I'd be lying if I said it
wasn't a pleasing side effect.

20:12.440 --> 20:14.598
OK, let's do it.

20:14.599 --> 20:16.078
Oh, God.

20:16.079 --> 20:17.479
So you're ready to cancel?

20:17.480 --> 20:20.038
- And re-book.
- Yes, we are.

20:20.039 --> 20:22.558
As soon as you say to me
the word "cancel", I am going to

20:22.559 --> 20:27.159
press this button, and that's it -
your original booking will be lost.

20:27.160 --> 20:28.479
OK.

20:28.480 --> 20:30.598
There's no going back at that point.

20:30.599 --> 20:32.278
I understand.

20:32.279 --> 20:35.278
Are you quite sure you want me to do this?

20:35.279 --> 20:37.680
Sorry, am I talking to Chris Tarrant here?

20:39.000 --> 20:40.999
Yes, we are ready.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.118
OK. Whenever you're ready,

20:43.119 --> 20:46.680
say the word "cancel",
and I'll cancel the booking.

20:48.839 --> 20:50.039
Cancel.

20:52.440 --> 20:54.759
Hello? George?

20:56.000 --> 20:57.719
Oh, God. The signal's gone.

20:57.720 --> 20:59.519
Quick, Charlie, pass me my phone.

20:59.519 --> 21:01.878
- It's stopped working.
- What?

21:01.880 --> 21:03.239
The battery's gone.

21:03.240 --> 21:05.679
- Is it B for battery?
- No!

21:05.680 --> 21:07.439
Why the hell did you let him play with it?

21:07.440 --> 21:09.838
It's not fair. I want to play with the phone.

21:09.839 --> 21:10.999
Don't worry.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.558
If you want to see an angry bird,
just keep looking at your mother.

21:13.559 --> 21:17.759
I spy with my little eye,
something beginning with B.

21:17.759 --> 21:19.719
For the love of God, will somebody guess it?

21:19.720 --> 21:22.038
Breakdown. Mental bloody breakdown.

21:22.039 --> 21:24.239
I still feel sick.

21:24.240 --> 21:26.398
Just get me to some phone reception, quick.

21:26.400 --> 21:29.000
Can we all have a nice little singsong
and stop shouting, please?

21:31.319 --> 21:33.318
- Bridge.
- No, guess again.

21:33.319 --> 21:35.959
Why the hell could you not just have
read the booking form properly?

21:35.960 --> 21:37.759
I wish I'd read the terms and conditions on our

21:37.759 --> 21:40.078
marriage certificate properly.
"If you are happy to spend

21:40.079 --> 21:42.959
"the rest of your life being blamed
for everything, please tick here."

21:42.960 --> 21:45.278
- Begins with B!
- Bridge!

21:45.279 --> 21:47.638
- You just said that.
- Bridge!

21:47.640 --> 21:50.239
Mummy, he's trying to annoy me.

21:50.240 --> 21:52.078
That's because all men are hideous.

21:52.079 --> 21:55.199
- Bridge!
- Stop it, Charlie. It's not bridge!

21:55.200 --> 21:56.878
Can we all stop shouting, please?

21:56.880 --> 21:59.439
- Bridge!
- She just said it's not bridge!

21:59.440 --> 22:00.479
I feel sick!

22:00.480 --> 22:02.638
- But, Daddy!
- Yes, Charlie, what is it?

22:02.640 --> 22:04.559
Bridge!

22:12.920 --> 22:14.598
Is everyone all right?

22:14.599 --> 22:16.439
Yes.

22:16.440 --> 22:19.638
Sorry. What is it you wanted to say, Charlie?

22:19.640 --> 22:22.400
I think we're going to crash into that bridge.

22:23.599 --> 22:25.039
Thanks, son.

22:27.759 --> 22:29.719
Tell you what - it's a lot easier

22:29.720 --> 22:33.558
getting those bikes off the roof
than it is putting them on.

22:33.559 --> 22:35.960
At least we're lower than 1.85 metres now.

22:37.400 --> 22:39.959
Shame we cancelled that booking.

22:39.960 --> 22:42.920
Unless the phone cut
out before he heard us say it.

22:45.079 --> 22:46.358
What?

22:46.359 --> 22:49.798
Well, we don't know exactly
when the phone cut out.

22:49.799 --> 22:52.839
It's possible he didn't hear us say "cancel".

22:54.039 --> 22:57.719
That means we might still
be booked on the ferry.

22:57.720 --> 23:00.239
And that we have an extra
15 minutes to get there,

23:00.240 --> 23:02.798
because we're now a low vehicle.

23:02.799 --> 23:05.159
What time would that make last check-in?

23:05.160 --> 23:07.398
7:15.

23:07.400 --> 23:11.719
Charlie, what time does it say we're
going to get there on the sat nav?

23:11.720 --> 23:13.799
7:15.

23:14.799 --> 23:16.640
Back in the car!

23:33.599 --> 23:37.640
Wait! Wait! Wait!

23:44.960 --> 23:49.919
Stop! Stop, please!

23:49.920 --> 23:52.038
We're here. Let us on.

23:52.039 --> 23:53.318
What is that smell?

23:53.319 --> 23:54.798
It's a new fragrance from L'Oreal.

23:54.799 --> 23:56.759
It's called having kids.

23:56.759 --> 24:01.278
Well, I'm sorry. Check-in's closed.
Ferry's ready to depart.

24:01.279 --> 24:03.398
Well, it hasn't departed, has it?
You can let us on.

24:03.400 --> 24:05.119
Sorry, nothing I can do.

24:10.200 --> 24:11.759
Please.

24:11.759 --> 24:16.558
I know I stink of sick and it looks
like we've ram-raided Halfords,

24:16.559 --> 24:21.398
but we are nice people and we have
been through hell to get here.

24:21.400 --> 24:24.598
No British person has ever fought
harder to get to Cherbourg,

24:24.599 --> 24:27.159
and, yes, I include 1944 in that.

24:27.160 --> 24:29.798
At least during Operation Overlord,
the Allies didn't have to

24:29.799 --> 24:32.319
sing Head, Shoulders, Knees And Toes.

24:34.319 --> 24:38.038
Please. I have to get to my cousin's wedding.

24:38.039 --> 24:40.798
I have to see the start of a marriage -

24:40.799 --> 24:43.920
the happy bit, with cake and dancing.

24:45.079 --> 24:46.720
Please!

24:48.640 --> 24:50.239
OK, OK.

24:50.240 --> 24:55.479
If you promise to let go of me,
I'm sure I can sneak one more on.

24:55.480 --> 24:57.039
(Thank you.)

25:01.240 --> 25:02.479
Booking reference?

25:02.480 --> 25:06.078
Well, here's the interesting thing.

25:06.079 --> 25:09.719
You see, a few miles back, we sort
of phoned and cancelled the booking,

25:09.720 --> 25:12.679
although we might not have done,
in which case we want to keep it.

25:12.680 --> 25:16.720
But if we have cancelled it,
we want to make it un-cancelled.

25:18.720 --> 25:21.398
Well, you're either booked on or you're not,

25:21.400 --> 25:24.559
and if you're not, then you're not getting on.

25:35.880 --> 25:38.798
Looking forward to reading this
novel when you've finished it.

25:38.799 --> 25:41.398
Here we are.

25:41.400 --> 25:45.599
I can confirm, in fact...

25:51.000 --> 25:52.479
...you're still booked on.

25:52.480 --> 25:54.079
Yes!

25:55.480 --> 25:56.759
See, I told you.

25:56.759 --> 25:59.318
The phone must have cut
off and he didn't hear us say "cancel".

25:59.319 --> 26:01.719
Oh, no, he must have
definitely heard you say it,

26:01.720 --> 26:04.919
cos there's a note here
from an operator called George,

26:04.920 --> 26:07.999
saying he tried to cancel it,
but the system wouldn't let him.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.078
Why not?

26:09.079 --> 26:11.118
Well, he obviously didn't realise the rules.

26:11.119 --> 26:14.440
Last-minute cancellations
are for premium passengers only.

26:17.559 --> 26:19.000
Which we are not.

26:22.400 --> 26:23.720
Just drive.

26:28.319 --> 26:31.118
We made it! Three cheers for Daddy's driving.

26:31.119 --> 26:32.279
Hip-hip...

26:34.200 --> 26:37.038
Great(!) All over my wedding outfit.

26:37.039 --> 26:39.960
So that's a new dress AND
new bikes we have to buy.

26:41.119 --> 26:42.838
Hang on. Molly,

26:42.839 --> 26:44.679
it's not B for bikes, is it?

26:44.680 --> 26:46.799
Yeah, Daddy wins!
