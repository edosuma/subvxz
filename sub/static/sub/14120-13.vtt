(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

00:05.638 --> 00:07.940
MIKE: <i> Thank you all</i>
<i>for coming out.</i>

00:07.942 --> 00:11.777
<i>We're here, of course,</i>
<i>to celebrate Miles and</i>
<i>his tremendous weight loss.</i>

00:11.779 --> 00:14.980
<i>He worked with me</i>
<i>and the team</i>
<i>for the past six months.</i>

00:14.982 --> 00:18.684
<i>And today, we get to show you</i>
<i>the result of his hard work.</i>

00:18.686 --> 00:23.022
<i>So, ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>I give you the new</i>
<i>and improved,</i>

00:23.024 --> 00:24.990
<i>Miles Kleffman.</i>

00:24.992 --> 00:27.259
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

00:28.194 --> 00:29.495
Who are all these people?

00:29.497 --> 00:31.263
<i>They're all your</i>
<i>friends, Miles.</i>

00:31.265 --> 00:32.664
I don't have any friends.

00:32.666 --> 00:34.466
Yeah, I know but
that seemed very depressing

00:34.468 --> 00:36.635
so we're paying these people
to cheer for you.

00:36.637 --> 00:38.971
<i>Now, before we find out</i>
<i>your current weight</i>

00:38.973 --> 00:42.674
<i>let's remind all your friends</i>
<i>what you used to look like.</i>

00:43.576 --> 00:45.244
<i>Whoa! Oh, my God.</i>

00:45.246 --> 00:48.113
<i>I forgot how</i> (BLEEP)
<i>fat you were. Damn!</i>

00:48.115 --> 00:50.115
<i>But let's see what</i>
<i>you weigh now.</i>

00:50.117 --> 00:51.917
(SCALE BEEPING)

00:51.919 --> 00:54.553
<i>One hundred</i>
<i>and ninety-seven pounds.</i>

00:54.555 --> 00:56.922
-(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)
<i>-What an incredible</i>
<i>transformation.</i>

00:56.924 --> 01:00.692
<i>How did we get here?</i>
<i>Well, let's just roll the tape</i>
<i>to find out.</i>

01:00.694 --> 01:03.996
<i>Okay, we're approaching</i>
<i>the house of</i>
<i>Miles Kleffman.</i>

01:03.998 --> 01:08.300
<i>The 31-year old,</i>
<i>Caucasian male, you know.</i>
<i>Think Ryan Gosling.</i>

01:08.302 --> 01:11.437
<i>Like if Ryan Gosling ate</i>
<i>a whole other Ryan Gosling</i>

01:11.439 --> 01:14.139
<i>and maybe a couple more</i>
<i>Ryan Goslings after that.</i>

01:14.141 --> 01:15.908
(BELL DINGS)

01:15.910 --> 01:19.645
<i>Miles send us a pigeon</i>
<i>with a note asking</i>
<i>for our help</i>

01:19.647 --> 01:21.747
<i>to get him in shape and</i>
<i>help him lose the weight.</i>

01:21.749 --> 01:24.850
<i>Oh! Hello. Are we on TV?</i>

01:24.852 --> 01:26.852
No, this is my agent Deezy.

01:26.854 --> 01:29.555
He's just filming
this particular mystery
to protect us from, you know,

01:29.557 --> 01:32.858
any liabilities in the result
of your, you know, death.

01:32.860 --> 01:36.862
Because you're so fat
and whatnot, you know.
Come on.

01:36.864 --> 01:38.864
Thanks so much for coming.

01:38.866 --> 01:43.302
I just feel like if I don't
get help now I don't know
how much longer...

01:43.304 --> 01:45.838
Oh, I didn't hit "Record".
Can you say that again?

01:45.840 --> 01:47.973
PIGEON: Jesus Christ,
can you do anything?

01:47.975 --> 01:50.576
Give the camera to
the Japanese girl and get
the (BLEEP) out of here.

01:50.578 --> 01:52.878
(BLEEP) you, mother (BLEEP).
You get out of here.

01:52.880 --> 01:54.646
-We're working.
-We're working?

01:54.648 --> 01:58.817
We're working?
You're not on the team,
(BLEEP) for brains.

01:58.819 --> 02:00.719
Well, that's not really
your call now,
is it, Pigeon?

02:00.721 --> 02:03.355
That's Mike's call.
Mike says whether or not
I'm on the team.

02:03.357 --> 02:06.592
PIGEON: Mike, is Deezy
on the team?

02:06.926 --> 02:08.727
No.

02:08.729 --> 02:10.329
Whoa, whoa, wait.
We don't have to make
decisions right now.

02:10.331 --> 02:12.364
I mean, Mike's a got a lot
on his plate.

02:12.366 --> 02:13.932
First, let's table this.
We can talk about it
at the next team meeting.

02:13.934 --> 02:15.767
Uh, Miles,
you were saying, my man?

02:15.769 --> 02:17.903
(CHEWING) I just don't know
where to start.

02:17.905 --> 02:21.807
Well, you could start
by putting down that...
What is that?

02:21.809 --> 02:23.142
It's a cake sandwich.

02:23.144 --> 02:24.810
What the (BLEEP)
is a cake sandwich?

02:24.812 --> 02:27.946
Well, traditionally,
two pieces of bread
with cake in the middle.

02:27.948 --> 02:32.317
But what I like to do is
two pieces of cake... (GROANS)

02:32.319 --> 02:34.219
With a piece of cake
in the middle.

02:34.221 --> 02:35.888
-Mmm.
-Mmm-hmm. Okay.

02:35.890 --> 02:37.956
Have you ever thought of
snacking on vegetables?

02:37.958 --> 02:40.559
I like to make myself
a little crudite plate in
the afternoon...

02:40.561 --> 02:43.862
I don't like vegetables.
I don't like the way
they taste.

02:43.864 --> 02:45.430
What about juicing?

02:45.432 --> 02:47.132
Mmm, interesting idea, Yung.

02:47.134 --> 02:48.667
I mean, I never had to do it.

02:48.669 --> 02:51.136
But it is a way to
get results fast.

02:51.138 --> 02:55.374
Maybe we can just start
with some testosterone.
A little blood doping.

02:55.376 --> 02:57.209
Deezy could hook you up
with all that (BLEEP).

02:57.211 --> 02:58.410
YUNG HEE: Dad, what are you
talking about?

02:58.412 --> 03:00.379
Juicing, anabolic steroids.

03:00.381 --> 03:04.216
Um, I'm talking about juicing
fruits and vegetables.

03:04.218 --> 03:06.385
Oh, oh, oh. Oh...

03:06.387 --> 03:08.353
Deezy, you're gonna
wanna edit that (BLEEP) out.

03:08.355 --> 03:10.255
PIGEON: Yeah, I wouldn't worry
about it, Mike.

03:10.257 --> 03:12.391
I'm guessing, uh,
Scorsese over here

03:12.393 --> 03:14.326
forgot to hit "Record" again.

03:14.328 --> 03:17.129
-(BLEEP) you, Pigeon. I know
what the hell I'm doing.
-(PIGEON LAUGHS)

03:17.131 --> 03:20.566
Oh, (BLEEP). Hey, can we
take that again? This button
is a little sticky.

03:20.568 --> 03:23.702
Hello, I'm Mrs. Kleffman.

03:23.704 --> 03:25.204
Miles's mom.

03:25.206 --> 03:28.440
Nice to meet you, ma'am.
We're here help your son
lose some weight.

03:28.442 --> 03:31.476
What? Miles doesn't need to
lose any weight.

03:31.478 --> 03:35.180
Why? So he can get in shape
and find a job

03:35.182 --> 03:39.918
and meet a pretty girl
and start a family
and leave me to die alone?

03:39.920 --> 03:41.587
(CHUCKLING NERVOUSLY)

03:41.589 --> 03:44.323
-He is perfect just
the way he is.
-(MILES MUMBLING)

03:44.325 --> 03:47.159
RECEPTIONIST: We basically
have three tiers
of memberships available.

03:47.161 --> 03:48.594
I'll be honest with you.

03:48.596 --> 03:50.696
I think our best one
is our Platinum membership

03:50.698 --> 03:54.366
which is 36 months
at $300 down
and $29 a month.

03:54.368 --> 03:59.204
That gets you 24-hour access
to the gym and unlimited
cardio classes and...

03:59.206 --> 04:02.541
I'm just gonna be honest
with you. You came at
the perfect time

04:02.543 --> 04:06.178
because I think they're not
gonna offer that deal
for that much longer.

04:06.180 --> 04:07.579
Okay, let's do it.

04:07.581 --> 04:09.147
Hold it, Mike. 36 months?

04:09.149 --> 04:10.916
That's too big a commitment.

04:10.918 --> 04:12.884
We don't wanna be
involved with the same guy
for 36 months.

04:12.886 --> 04:14.653
Come on, now.

04:14.655 --> 04:16.855
You got anything less than
36 months?

04:16.857 --> 04:20.592
Our Silver level is 18 months
but I'm gonna be honest
with you.

04:20.594 --> 04:23.328
That's not as good a deal
as the Platinum.

04:23.330 --> 04:24.863
Man, why do keep saying that?

04:24.865 --> 04:26.665
Keep saying that "I'm gonna be
honest with you."

04:26.667 --> 04:29.234
You know, I think is you're
a (BLEEP) liar.

04:29.236 --> 04:30.636
How much is the Silver one?

04:30.638 --> 04:33.472
Oh, that's $400 down
and $19 a month.

04:33.474 --> 04:35.340
But no cardio classes

04:35.342 --> 04:39.144
and you can only use
the locker room on
off-peak time.

04:39.146 --> 04:40.412
And what are those times?

04:40.414 --> 04:41.880
MAN: Well, peak times

04:41.882 --> 04:43.882
are between
8:00 a.m. and 10 a.m.

04:43.884 --> 04:48.520
and 12:00 p.m. and 2:00 p.m.
and 4:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m.

04:48.522 --> 04:51.256
And that's when you can use it
or you can't use it?

04:51.258 --> 04:52.624
Can't use it.

04:52.626 --> 04:54.726
-MIKE: And what's in there?
-Uh, what?

04:54.728 --> 04:56.428
What's in that locker room?

04:56.430 --> 05:00.899
Oh, I'm gonna be honest
with you. It's just
a regular locker room.

05:00.901 --> 05:04.036
That means he's lying.
I bet it's a great
locker room.

05:05.638 --> 05:07.806
What is this, 1950? (CHUCKLES)

05:07.808 --> 05:11.243
Look at this bitch,
air drying her sheets.

05:11.245 --> 05:13.545
Oh, (BLEEP).
It's that kid's pants.

05:13.547 --> 05:15.681
Oh, we're getting rid of
all this food

05:15.683 --> 05:18.583
but what he really need is
rid of his that mother.

05:18.585 --> 05:20.419
I mean she is so afraid of
being alone

05:20.421 --> 05:23.889
that she's basically willing
to throw her own
son's life away...

05:23.891 --> 05:25.757
(LAUGHING)

05:25.759 --> 05:29.094
That's so funny.
That's some...
That's very funny, Pigeon.

05:30.897 --> 05:32.564
I didn't say anything.

05:34.567 --> 05:36.868
You are such an asshole.

05:36.870 --> 05:38.403
I mean, I'm sorry

05:38.405 --> 05:40.939
but getting this young man
a gym membership
is pointless.

05:40.941 --> 05:42.274
Michael is delusional

05:42.276 --> 05:44.776
if he thinks... (LAUGHING)

05:44.778 --> 05:47.713
Aw, Pigeon.
Ah, that is so funny.

05:47.715 --> 05:49.815
What?
What did you say, Pigeon?

05:49.817 --> 05:51.950
Well, I was talking
about this friend of mine

05:51.952 --> 05:54.786
who went to the doctor
'cause he had a sore back
and they told him...

05:54.788 --> 05:57.122
He has about six months
to live, at most.

05:57.124 --> 05:59.257
Man, he has two young kids.

05:59.259 --> 06:01.693
Then, Marquess
started laughing.

06:01.695 --> 06:03.228
You know, I don't get it.

06:03.230 --> 06:06.698
I just don't understand
how someone could
laugh at that.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.934
That's (BLEEP) up, Marquess.
That's real (BLEEP) up.

06:08.936 --> 06:10.969
-YUNG HEE: Did you get the gym
membership?
-Nah.

06:10.971 --> 06:13.839
I didn't have my wallet and
Deezy got bad credit.

06:13.841 --> 06:16.608
We'll just had to work
him out in the backyard.

06:16.610 --> 06:19.244
You're just a huge,
big asshole.

06:19.246 --> 06:22.914
I'll tell you
what the kid needs
is Yung his (BLEEP).

06:22.916 --> 06:23.915
(GASPS) What?

06:23.917 --> 06:25.951
Huh? Calm down.
It's not what you think.

06:25.953 --> 06:27.753
You're saying he needs
to have sex with me.

06:27.755 --> 06:29.588
Oh. It is what you think.

06:29.590 --> 06:32.324
I'm sorry. How would that
help him lose weight?

06:32.326 --> 06:34.159
Let me tell you a story.

06:34.161 --> 06:38.029
I was once a fat shit
no different than Miles there.

06:38.031 --> 06:39.931
I was 13 and miserable.

06:39.933 --> 06:43.602
<i>One day my Dad shows up</i>
<i>out of nowhere and throws me</i>
<i>in the car with him.</i>

06:43.604 --> 06:46.204
<i>Says we're going out</i>
<i>on a fishing trip.</i>

06:46.206 --> 06:49.207
<i>Well, we drove all night.</i>
<i>He was a drunk.</i>

06:49.209 --> 06:51.109
<i>Didn't talk much.</i>

06:51.111 --> 06:53.378
<i>I think I was asleep when</i>
<i>we crossed the border</i>
<i>into Mexico.</i>

06:53.380 --> 06:55.814
<i>Some small place.</i>

06:55.816 --> 06:59.418
<i>We pulled up. I said,</i>
<i>"Is this the lake?"</i>

06:59.420 --> 07:01.820
<i>Ha, he just laughed</i>
<i>and went in.</i>

07:01.822 --> 07:03.755
<i>It was a whorehouse,</i>
<i>of course.</i>

07:03.757 --> 07:05.891
<i>They brought 'em up,</i>
<i>lined 'em up.</i>

07:05.893 --> 07:09.327
<i>He had me choose.</i>
<i>Oh, I'll never forget it.</i>

07:09.329 --> 07:12.130
<i>Older, smelled</i>
<i>like cigarettes.</i>

07:12.132 --> 07:14.599
<i>She laughed</i>
<i>and took me upstairs.</i>

07:14.601 --> 07:18.837
<i>I remember looking back</i>
<i>at my father but he was busy,</i>
<i>picking out one for himself.</i>

07:18.839 --> 07:21.373
(SCOFFS) What a piece of shit.

07:21.375 --> 07:24.042
My God,
what are you telling us?

07:24.044 --> 07:26.878
Huh?
That I (BLEEP) this woman.

07:26.880 --> 07:29.181
Yeah, I felt great for
the first time in my life.

07:29.183 --> 07:32.184
Got a ton of confidence.
Lost a bunch of weight.

07:32.186 --> 07:34.553
Why, it turned my life around.

07:35.054 --> 07:36.188
Welp,

07:36.190 --> 07:37.722
something to think about.

07:39.225 --> 07:41.493
He is seriously disturbed.

07:41.495 --> 07:43.528
I know, that's so crazy.

07:44.430 --> 07:46.431
(THINKING) <i> Or is it?</i>

07:46.433 --> 07:49.601
<i>It's not like my virginity</i>
<i>doesn't constantly weigh</i>
<i>on my shoulders.</i>

07:49.603 --> 07:51.069
<i>It's like a noose around</i>
<i>my neck.</i>

07:51.071 --> 07:53.638
<i>I mean, if you look past</i>
<i>the physical stuff,</i>

07:53.640 --> 07:55.407
<i>he is a person.</i>

07:55.409 --> 07:58.076
<i>A heart, a soul.</i> (SIGHS)

07:58.078 --> 08:00.145
<i>Come on, Yung.</i>
<i>What are you so scared of?</i>

08:00.147 --> 08:01.646
(INHALES)

08:01.648 --> 08:03.148
(EXHALES) <i> I'm gonna do it.</i>

08:03.150 --> 08:06.284
<i>I'm gonna lose my virginity</i>
<i>to Miles Kleffman.</i>

08:10.157 --> 08:11.690
-Yeah, okay. No, I'm not.
-You're not what?

08:11.692 --> 08:13.191
He got it all over
my (BLEEP) shoes.

08:13.193 --> 08:15.093
Come on, we're getting
out of here now, man.

08:15.095 --> 08:16.528
We solved the mystery.

08:17.563 --> 08:19.731
Mom! Mom!

08:19.733 --> 08:23.168
Miles, honey.
What happened to you?

08:23.170 --> 08:25.237
Oh, you poor thing.

08:25.239 --> 08:26.805
I'm gonna draw you a bath

08:26.807 --> 08:30.408
and then I'm gonna make you
a grilled cheese sandwich.

08:30.410 --> 08:32.110
Shame on you people.

08:32.112 --> 08:35.180
You pushed him too hard.
He can't do it.

08:36.182 --> 08:38.817
Miles, you might not
wanna hear this

08:38.819 --> 08:40.719
but if you wanna
change your life

08:40.721 --> 08:43.388
you gonna have to free
yourself from your mother.

08:43.390 --> 08:44.556
I know you can do this.

08:44.558 --> 08:46.391
(EXCLAIMS)
You're covered in vomit.
