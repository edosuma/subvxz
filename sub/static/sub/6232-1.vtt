00:38.200 --> 00:43.570
Dear Nick, He has been sold.

00:43.760 --> 00:45.967
To a club in Amsterdam.

00:47.480 --> 00:50.723
He likes little boys now too.

00:53.200 --> 01:00.243
Dear Nick, He starved to
death. That is the truth.

01:07.720 --> 01:10.929
The truth, my esteemed Nick...

01:13.480 --> 01:16.723
He lived in a caravan
all those years.

01:18.440 --> 01:20.522
As my lover.

02:13.040 --> 02:14.201
Plettinckx!

02:21.520 --> 02:22.487
Plettinckx!

02:22.840 --> 02:27.801
If I see you at my house one more time,
I'm going to get you. You bastard!

02:29.400 --> 02:31.482
I'm going to fucking get you!

02:41.920 --> 02:46.960
THE TREATMENT

02:47.920 --> 02:49.365
9 Hert Road.

02:49.560 --> 02:52.086
Mr Simons has been
taken to hospital,

02:52.280 --> 02:55.284
Mrs Simons is currently receiving
treatment on the spot.

02:57.520 --> 02:59.807
Someone saw a man run into
the park behind the house.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.924
The perpetrator may still be
in the park with the child.

03:04.360 --> 03:06.362
Robin!

03:07.320 --> 03:08.287
Robin!

03:08.760 --> 03:12.128
The park behind the house has been
cordoned off. Local teams are there.

03:12.320 --> 03:14.288
Robin!

03:15.760 --> 03:17.285
Let go of me!

04:28.920 --> 04:30.843
Christ.

04:45.520 --> 04:47.443
They found the mother in here.

04:48.960 --> 04:52.043
The doctor says another twelve
hours and they'd have been dead.

05:02.640 --> 05:05.371
The father was handcuffed
to that pipe there.

05:08.880 --> 05:12.168
The child was probably
tied to that stove.

05:17.240 --> 05:20.608
We think the perpetrator took the
child with him when he fled.

05:33.720 --> 05:35.848
A neighbour saw a figure
heading for the park.

05:36.040 --> 05:40.602
And he probably escaped this way.
That blood is still fresh.

05:40.800 --> 05:44.885
- It could be the child's, eh?
- Yes. Sorry. Danni speaking.

06:31.680 --> 06:35.321
Sir? Hey, you! Come
away from there, sir.

06:37.720 --> 06:38.801
I can keep what I find, eh?

06:38.920 --> 06:42.129
Have you seen a little boy, about
9 years old, who's been hurt?

06:42.320 --> 06:46.211
- No, I haven't seen a little boy.
- Have you got your ID card on you, sir?

07:04.560 --> 07:05.561
Nick?

07:05.760 --> 07:09.242
- Coordination briefing at the station.
- But he's still in the park.

07:09.440 --> 07:12.205
8 teams are searching.
I need you at the briefing.

07:12.680 --> 07:15.126
This is Golf 1-2. We think
we've seen a heat source.

07:15.320 --> 07:19.848
- Where? Where?
- 60 metres from the open-air theatre.

07:41.840 --> 07:46.687
- Golf 1-2. Can you come lower?
- Message received. We'll try.

07:50.640 --> 07:53.689
- We can't see anything now.
- We have to carry on looking.

07:54.440 --> 07:56.841
Heat source negative.

08:03.160 --> 08:06.687
- We'll extend the search area further.
- Bloody hell.

08:20.200 --> 08:23.204
Bloody hell. Bloody fucking hell.

08:32.039 --> 08:32.847
Bloody hell.

08:34.280 --> 08:37.489
Red paint diluted with
urine, according to the lab.

08:38.520 --> 08:41.251
Female toxin. That must
mean something to someone.

08:41.440 --> 08:44.330
Search your databases.
Not a word to the press.

08:44.520 --> 08:48.366
We'll use this "female toxin" to
weed out the jokers and the loonies.

08:48.560 --> 08:50.130
My first thought was
a loony though.

08:50.320 --> 08:53.005
We'll see who's been released
from psychiatric hospital

08:53.200 --> 08:55.362
but mustn't just look
at psychiatric cases.

08:55.560 --> 08:59.281
It can have been made to look like
the work of a lunatic to mislead us.

08:59.480 --> 09:01.403
Or in order to be able
to plead insanity.

09:01.600 --> 09:05.047
Imprisoning three people for three
days is controlled, planned.

09:05.240 --> 09:07.242
Arrange things at home
for the next few days.

09:07.440 --> 09:12.287
Be back by 5:30. To search the park with a
fine-tooth comb and to go door to door. OK?

09:18.400 --> 09:21.324
Can you search for intruder,

09:21.520 --> 09:24.171
abduction, handcuffs, child
aged between 5 and 10?

09:24.360 --> 09:27.170
Keep sexual offenders separate.

09:27.360 --> 09:31.490
Nick? The hospital called.
We can't talk to the Simonses.

09:31.680 --> 09:33.842
He has a tube in this
throat and she is sedated.

09:34.040 --> 09:38.284
They'll call us as soon as there is
any change. Get a few hours' sleep.

09:38.480 --> 09:40.528
- Sleep?
- Come on. Get some sleep.

10:04.360 --> 10:05.566
- Sir?
- Oh, Rudy.

10:05.760 --> 10:08.240
- You can't go in there.
- Police.

10:08.440 --> 10:11.171
I've received strict orders.
Mrs Simons is sedated...

10:11.360 --> 10:14.603
Mrs Simons' child is missing. I doubt
she'll mind if we wake her up.

10:14.800 --> 10:17.406
Which bit of no don't
we understand?

10:20.040 --> 10:21.690
I'll wait there.

10:55.640 --> 10:56.846
Hello?

10:59.520 --> 11:02.603
- Is there any news?
- Yes, Mr Simons is out of danger.

11:02.800 --> 11:05.883
But you can't talk to him, he
still has a tube in his trachea.

11:06.080 --> 11:07.206
Is his wife awake?

11:07.400 --> 11:10.643
She has just discharged herself.
A friend picked her up.

11:11.040 --> 11:12.610
And you just left me there?

11:13.880 --> 11:16.451
I thought you knew.
A policewoman was with her.

11:16.640 --> 11:18.165
Bloody hell!

11:18.520 --> 11:21.888
Did we send anyone to collect
Mrs Simons from hospital?

11:22.920 --> 11:23.967
Where to?

11:40.920 --> 11:43.400
- Good morning, madam. Chief Inspector...
- Come in.

11:43.840 --> 11:46.207
She's upstairs in the spare
room. She is in a bad way.

11:46.400 --> 11:47.686
She's distraught.

11:47.880 --> 11:50.042
You can go on up without me.

11:50.240 --> 11:51.480
Thank you.

11:57.840 --> 11:59.001
In there?

12:13.160 --> 12:17.324
Mrs Simons. Chief Inspector
Cafmeyer, Federal Police.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.891
We are doing all we can to find
Robin as fast as possible.

12:23.080 --> 12:25.128
The doctor needs to comeback.

12:25.920 --> 12:29.163
- I want something stronger.
- We'll sort that out for you.

12:34.280 --> 12:36.886
Could we first go over
what you can remember?

12:37.440 --> 12:39.124
I don't remember anything.

12:41.240 --> 12:43.447
Only what I told that woman.

13:04.880 --> 13:07.360
I didn't feel very
well after dinner.

13:11.360 --> 13:17.811
Alex was playing on the Playstation
with Robin in the cellar.

13:23.360 --> 13:28.127
I think I fainted. Because I
woke up in that cupboard.

13:32.120 --> 13:33.963
I was handcuffed to that pipe.

13:39.600 --> 13:43.571
- No one called round until Monday?
- Everyone thought we'd gone to the seaside.

13:44.080 --> 13:46.811
We were supposed to leave on
Saturday for the weekend.

13:49.040 --> 13:52.442
Then you woke up. And then?

13:55.320 --> 13:58.369
I was woken up by snuffling
noises outside the cupboard.

14:00.640 --> 14:02.483
Like an animal makes.

14:04.680 --> 14:07.160
- A dog?
- No.

14:09.400 --> 14:10.970
At the top of the door.

14:12.160 --> 14:13.764
That wasn't a dog.

14:23.960 --> 14:27.851
Apparently you didn't see the intruder.
Did he ignore you for three days?

14:28.320 --> 14:29.606
Yes.

14:32.200 --> 14:35.044
I could hear him coming
in and out using the key.

14:40.840 --> 14:43.969
Did you hear your husband
and your little boy?

14:53.160 --> 14:55.481
Our Robin was screaming.

15:02.040 --> 15:03.929
He was screaming.

15:09.320 --> 15:10.731
Did you hear anything else?

15:18.480 --> 15:22.121
I, uh... I saw a light
flashing under the door.

15:23.680 --> 15:26.763
- A torch?
- No, it was a flashlight.

15:28.280 --> 15:29.930
From a camera?

15:38.040 --> 15:40.771
And I just sat there.

15:44.280 --> 15:48.251
Like a coward, scared shitless.

15:48.440 --> 15:49.771
You mustn't say that.

15:51.160 --> 15:52.764
I've seen your medical file.

15:52.960 --> 15:55.691
You almost pulled your hands
off trying to get to Robin.

15:55.880 --> 15:58.486
Scared shitless, like a coward!

16:00.160 --> 16:02.561
- I just sat there.
- Mrs Simons...

16:02.760 --> 16:05.047
Like a coward, scared shitless!

16:26.680 --> 16:28.762
The troll did it.

16:30.400 --> 16:34.121
He looks down at you from a
tree when you're asleep.

16:35.160 --> 16:40.121
And the troll came down out of
his tree and took him away.

16:40.320 --> 16:41.685
Anahid?

16:43.560 --> 16:46.609
Get in your bed. Now.

16:55.280 --> 17:01.845
Take this, it brings good luck. Then
you can say a little prayer for him.

17:02.040 --> 17:03.610
OK.

17:28.520 --> 17:29.646
You're late.

17:29.840 --> 17:34.209
I went to see the mother, Cindy Simons,
at a friend's house. A strange woman.

17:34.400 --> 17:37.961
- Did you find anything else out?
- Photos may have been taken.

17:38.560 --> 17:41.882
You can go door to door along the east side
of the park, in that new neighbourhood.

17:55.320 --> 17:58.563
- Excuse me, madam.
- Yes?

17:59.240 --> 18:03.086
Chief Inspector Cafmeyer, Federal
Police. May I ask you a few questions?

18:03.280 --> 18:06.648
Yes, of course. Come in.
Sorry about the smell.

18:06.840 --> 18:10.322
The builders must have used the
ventilation pipe as a toilet.

18:52.680 --> 18:55.126
Tara, are you coming? Come on.

18:55.600 --> 18:57.489
Come on.

18:57.680 --> 19:00.160
That is Joff. And Tara.

19:01.720 --> 19:05.088
- Tea or coffee?
- Um, coffee, please.

19:08.240 --> 19:11.961
- Do any other people live here yet?
- No, we're the first ones.

19:12.160 --> 19:14.686
We only moved in a week ago, so...

19:17.080 --> 19:18.570
Jeff?

19:22.120 --> 19:24.043
- Where is the milk?
- I don't know.

19:24.560 --> 19:27.086
- Have you been feeding stray cats again?
- No.

19:28.600 --> 19:31.968
I know you've only just moved in but
have you noticed anything unusual?

19:32.160 --> 19:35.721
No. Apart from my
milk being stolen.

19:37.320 --> 19:40.085
Are you from the police?

19:40.280 --> 19:44.126
Have you come to catch the troll?
The troll who climbs the wall...

19:44.320 --> 19:46.766
- Go and wash your hands.
- He really does exist.

19:46.960 --> 19:48.883
- Wash your hands.
- He does, he eats kids.

19:49.080 --> 19:52.402
He doesn't exist. Go
and wash your hands.

19:53.280 --> 19:56.921
Sorry. Uh... no, nothing unusual.

19:58.680 --> 20:01.445
- A great view from here.
- Yes.

20:03.440 --> 20:07.764
- You were in the park yesterday evening?
- Yes, I was in the park.

20:08.000 --> 20:11.971
- You didn't see anything unusual?
- No. Just some policemen.

20:12.440 --> 20:15.523
- Pardon?
- Lots of policemen in the park.

20:18.440 --> 20:19.805
Right.

20:22.560 --> 20:26.610
Should you remember
anything, you can phone me.

20:31.480 --> 20:33.642
I can find my own
way out. Thank you.

20:37.040 --> 20:41.967
Whatever I find I can keep.
Whatever I find I can keep.

20:50.840 --> 20:53.844
- Well? Did you find anything?
- No, not really.

20:54.040 --> 20:56.042
- Just something about female toxin.
- Oh?

20:59.240 --> 21:03.245
- That looks very scientific.
- It's an article from the sixties.

21:03.440 --> 21:06.762
About how prolactin can
harm the environment.

21:07.840 --> 21:11.447
- And prolactin is?
- It says it's a female hormone.

21:11.640 --> 21:13.768
A weapon of mass destruction.

21:14.960 --> 21:17.804
- Where did you find it?
- In an American biog from Mississippi.

21:22.080 --> 21:24.845
There's something else I'd
like you to try before you go.

21:25.440 --> 21:29.001
Search the files for
the word troll.

21:29.880 --> 21:32.008
Troll?

21:34.200 --> 21:38.922
It's something kids believe in. Something
they frighten each other with.

21:41.560 --> 21:44.370
I know, it may be clutching
at straws but...

21:48.000 --> 21:49.331
Nick...

21:51.000 --> 21:56.211
This disappearance is very similar
to what happened to your brother.

21:56.840 --> 22:00.481
I wouldn't want you to end
up being overwhelmed by it.

22:00.680 --> 22:04.446
- I know how far you always go.
- I know my limits, Danni.

22:06.760 --> 22:09.206
Alex Simons is off the ventilator.

22:13.880 --> 22:16.247
I must say, I was amazed.

22:16.440 --> 22:20.206
Three days without water.
Hardly any signs of dehydration.

22:20.400 --> 22:22.687
Talk about strong.

22:24.800 --> 22:26.404
Twenty minutes max.

22:39.320 --> 22:43.450
Mr Simons, Commissioner Petit,
Chief Inspector Cafmeyer.

22:43.640 --> 22:48.043
We're sorry about what happened to your
son. We're doing our best to find him.

22:48.280 --> 22:49.805
I know it isn't easy, Mr Simons,

22:50.000 --> 22:54.483
but it would help the investigation if
you told us everything you can remember.

23:03.040 --> 23:06.806
Maybe we can start with
how the intruder got in.

23:17.320 --> 23:19.721
Perhaps you can give
us a description?

23:19.960 --> 23:24.887
Age? Height?
Skin colour? Hair colour?

23:30.960 --> 23:33.770
- Don't look at me like that, pal.
- What?

23:34.480 --> 23:35.527
I don't like your eyes.

23:40.520 --> 23:45.526
If you want to help your son, think
about the intruder's eyes instead of...

24:00.640 --> 24:03.007
He wore dirty white
trainers, no special brand.

24:04.600 --> 24:07.046
- His trainers? Is that all?
- Yes.

24:07.720 --> 24:10.610
He was in the cellar playing on
the Playstation with his son.

24:10.840 --> 24:14.447
At half past six he went upstairs to
help his wife pack for the weekend.

24:14.680 --> 24:18.605
He was hit on the head. He woke up
blindfolded, handcuffed and gagged.

24:18.800 --> 24:19.801
End of story.

24:20.760 --> 24:22.569
That's a very short story.

24:24.120 --> 24:26.282
- Did he hear the window smash?
- He says not.

24:26.920 --> 24:30.766
He heard the intruder come and go and
he sometimes heard his wife crying.

24:31.680 --> 24:33.921
- Just his wife?
- He didn't hear his son anymore.

24:34.120 --> 24:37.124
He fainted Monday around midday.

24:37.320 --> 24:39.641
Around midday. So he could
keep an eye on the time?

24:39.840 --> 24:42.161
It seems the blindfold
let daylight through.

24:43.080 --> 24:44.809
- Did he see a flashlight flash?
- No.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.287
No? His wife was very
adamant about that.

24:47.720 --> 24:49.848
He won't tell you
more than he told me.

25:03.320 --> 25:04.890
Mummy? Mummy?

25:05.280 --> 25:07.248
Mummy?

25:07.520 --> 25:09.761
- What's the matter?
- There was a troll.

25:09.960 --> 25:14.045
There's no such thing. You're getting
too hot in your pyjamas. Take them off.

25:14.280 --> 25:17.011
No, Mummy. He was there at the
window and he looked at me.

25:17.200 --> 25:20.966
Trolls can't climb that high.
Shall I take a look?

25:25.360 --> 25:26.646
Come here. Give me a hug.

25:26.840 --> 25:30.731
You really scared him. I think
he's run off. Come and see.

25:30.920 --> 25:32.922
No trolls. Eh?

25:47.640 --> 25:52.521
- Have you cleaned the windows?
- No. We've only been here a week.

25:52.720 --> 25:57.886
It's from a workman who put the window
in and forgot to wipe his handprint off.

25:59.120 --> 26:03.091
Anyway, the hand was upside down.

26:04.440 --> 26:06.807
- Hey?
- Yeah.

26:07.520 --> 26:10.649
I'll be glad when
we're in Brittany.

26:37.680 --> 26:39.842
Happy birthday, Nick.

26:42.200 --> 26:46.171
What better birthday
present can I give you...

26:46.360 --> 26:51.730
after 25 years... than the truth...

26:51.920 --> 26:54.685
about your little brother?

26:55.760 --> 27:01.688
Not because I feel sorry
for you. Or regret what I did.

27:01.880 --> 27:07.808
Because everything he has
done for me and with me,

27:08.000 --> 27:13.006
time after time after time,

27:13.200 --> 27:17.888
he did because he loved me.

27:20.480 --> 27:26.362
Forget all the explanations
I've given you up till now.

27:26.560 --> 27:32.920
Because soon you will
know the absolute truth.

27:34.520 --> 27:39.890
God bless us all.

27:43.840 --> 27:45.683
Ivan Plettinckx.

27:51.160 --> 27:52.685
Bjorn?

27:55.360 --> 27:56.850
Bjorn?

27:59.040 --> 28:01.407
Bjorn?

28:08.080 --> 28:09.161
Bjorn?

28:49.120 --> 28:51.487
Alex Simons discharged
himself from hospital.

28:51.680 --> 28:54.081
- When?
- After we left there.

28:54.280 --> 28:58.080
He's gone to be with his wife at
that friend's house, Mrs Nercessian.

29:00.160 --> 29:03.130
- I'm going to help search the park.
- We're pulling out of the park.

29:03.320 --> 29:06.961
I've extended door-to-door enquiries.
And we're appealing for witnesses.

29:07.160 --> 29:10.164
But he's still there. I want to
take a dog team into the park.

29:10.520 --> 29:14.923
- I said we've finished in the park.
- I mean cadaver dogs.

32:00.480 --> 32:05.168
Rigor only present in the
face and upper torso.

32:11.120 --> 32:14.363
Mouth and nose:
dry scabs. Skin taut.

32:14.760 --> 32:16.888
Histology: check for hyperkaelemia.

32:17.080 --> 32:21.802
I want sodium level, concentration of
the antidiuretic hormone and plasma.

32:26.760 --> 32:30.048
Discolouration of larynx may indicate
strangulation with a ligature.

32:30.240 --> 32:35.246
No petechia in the eyes. Strangulation
is not the cause of death.

32:35.440 --> 32:36.521
What is then?

33:02.360 --> 33:04.124
A dentist needs to look at this.

33:34.440 --> 33:36.966
- Have they finished?
- No.

33:40.280 --> 33:42.248
I've just come from the parents.

33:47.360 --> 33:50.170
I heard it was you who suggested
looking in the trees.

33:50.360 --> 33:51.725
Yeah.

33:53.320 --> 33:55.243
In Bjorn's case they never... Well.

33:55.480 --> 34:00.850
Nick... you don't believe
there's a connection? Eh?

34:01.840 --> 34:02.921
Do you?

34:05.400 --> 34:08.483
- Is there a time of death?
- We have to wait for the lab report.

34:10.360 --> 34:14.603
- And was he...
- Sexually abused? Yes.

34:14.800 --> 34:19.248
There was bleeding in the rectum
and sperm was found on the swab.

34:21.920 --> 34:23.159
Thanks.

34:25.000 --> 34:26.331
Julie?

34:28.639 --> 34:31.246
- When can we have the DNA?
- In 48 hours.

34:31.440 --> 34:33.442
- What?
- I can't promise it any sooner.

34:33.639 --> 34:35.768
Who knows what that bastard
may do in 48 hours?

34:35.960 --> 34:38.327
- I want to start comparing it tomorrow.
- Who with?

34:38.520 --> 34:42.764
- All the paedophiles in the country?
- No. Just those who've been in prison.

34:42.960 --> 34:46.168
A belt round the neck, biting the
shoulder, that's a prison rape.

34:48.639 --> 34:50.880
- Shit! Dammit!
- What's the matter?

34:51.199 --> 34:53.965
I forgot to cancel the caterer.
He's outside my house.

34:54.600 --> 34:57.922
- I didn't tell those I'd invited either.
- You have to wait for the lab.

34:58.240 --> 34:59.605
Come on, birthday boy.

35:31.040 --> 35:32.804
Nick!

35:34.600 --> 35:36.204
Happy birthday.

35:58.080 --> 35:59.809
No, no, no.

36:00.000 --> 36:00.967
Bloody hell!

36:09.280 --> 36:12.523
That's where Bjorn ran away,
at the back through the bushes.

36:13.600 --> 36:16.444
Plettinckx was the main
suspect right from the start.

36:17.040 --> 36:21.045
They arrested him but
they had to let him go.

36:21.240 --> 36:23.641
I think he just enjoys
screwing me around.

36:23.840 --> 36:28.846
I've told you often enough. Sell this
place. Before something happens.

36:29.680 --> 36:32.331
It has started escalating recently.

36:34.080 --> 36:39.166
It has something to do with the Simons
case. He knows something or is involved.

36:39.800 --> 36:44.203
That paedophile network is like mould.
It spreads under the ground.

36:44.440 --> 36:45.930
It connects all the perverts.

36:46.120 --> 36:49.920
Plettinckx's virile years are
over. How old is he, 65?

36:50.320 --> 36:53.051
That doesn't matter these
days. There's viagra.

36:58.680 --> 37:04.403
He knows something. He knows something
or knows someone who knows someone else.

37:05.160 --> 37:08.130
- Let me question him.
- Stay far away from him, d'you hear me?

37:08.320 --> 37:10.527
We'll compare his DNA,
if you'll sleep better.

37:10.720 --> 37:13.371
That's what really matters, eh?
Me sleeping enough.

37:13.560 --> 37:15.881
So I'm able to get another
kid down from a tree!

37:16.120 --> 37:22.048
Herman from the lab won't take the
bones. He says they're pig's bones.

37:23.280 --> 37:24.327
Thanks.

37:43.600 --> 37:48.162
- This will be the hobby room.
- All you need now is a hobby.

37:48.360 --> 37:50.249
And this is the bedroom.

37:52.600 --> 37:54.090
Oh no. I don't believe it.

37:57.200 --> 38:00.363
Joff has let Tara
come upstairs again.

38:00.560 --> 38:03.530
- Does she do that often?
- Yes, she has done recently.

38:03.720 --> 38:06.963
Always on my side of the bed,
never a drop on Hans's side.

38:38.800 --> 38:40.564
Keep nice and straight.

38:53.280 --> 38:54.645
Are you alright, Iris?

39:05.120 --> 39:08.841
That child died of thirst.
Up that tree.

39:11.160 --> 39:13.845
He lay there suffering for
two days before he died.

39:17.960 --> 39:19.041
He hadn't finished.

39:22.120 --> 39:25.408
He was probably interrupted and
fled into the park with Robin.

39:27.080 --> 39:29.731
He had to hide him
and leave him there.

39:35.280 --> 39:36.930
He's going to do it again.

39:39.200 --> 39:41.168
Is that the search
result for troll?

39:41.360 --> 39:44.284
Yes, it's an unsolved
case from the nineties.

39:44.480 --> 39:47.484
That's the number of the inspector
on the case. He's retired now.

40:03.720 --> 40:09.443
There. That's the file. Morckhoven
Avenue. November '97.

40:09.800 --> 40:13.407
These maybe. They're the only
things worth looking at.

40:13.600 --> 40:16.888
They were found in the
litter bin in that street.

40:18.360 --> 40:21.091
- Blurred photos.
- Yes.

40:22.160 --> 40:25.369
His own mother wouldn't
recognise him in those.

40:25.600 --> 40:28.763
Anyway, we didn't get any
reaction in relation to them.

40:28.960 --> 40:30.883
No one was reported missing either.

40:37.040 --> 40:39.042
Where did the word troll come from?

40:41.160 --> 40:44.881
There was an anonymous phone call.

40:45.080 --> 40:48.641
Some really confused guy
who was clearly drunk.

40:48.840 --> 40:54.131
He started crying, saying his wife
had left him, had deserted him

40:54.320 --> 40:58.120
and that the boy in the
photo was his son.

40:58.360 --> 41:01.091
And that the troll had done it.

41:02.680 --> 41:06.446
- Done what?
- He didn't say.

41:15.320 --> 41:20.884
Did the name Ivan Plettinckx come up
at any time during the investigation?

41:21.160 --> 41:22.650
Plettinckx?

41:24.560 --> 41:28.724
If that's a paedophile from the area
then we certainly screened him.

41:29.800 --> 41:32.804
We screened lots of them back then.

41:35.880 --> 41:41.205
Yes, here, look. Plettinckx.
Interviewed, no further action.

41:43.000 --> 41:44.968
Is he a suspect?

43:37.680 --> 43:39.045
ONCOLOGY DEPARTMENT

43:40.320 --> 43:42.766
IVAN PLETTINCKX... LUNG CANCER...

43:44.960 --> 43:46.769
SPREAD TO...
OPERATION IS POINTLESS.

44:32.240 --> 44:33.924
Could you stay outside?

44:37.280 --> 44:39.123
This is rather private.

44:43.360 --> 44:45.601
You promised to tell the truth.

44:49.480 --> 44:50.970
You promised.

44:52.760 --> 44:54.285
You promised.

44:54.840 --> 44:56.524
What do you want to know?

44:59.440 --> 45:02.967
Let's start... with the troll.

45:05.520 --> 45:09.605
You mean... the biter.

45:22.520 --> 45:26.206
Wouldn't you rather know something
about... about your little brother?

45:31.000 --> 45:34.243
You should get your
priorities right, Cafmeyer.

45:44.960 --> 45:46.041
What about the biter?

45:54.160 --> 45:55.571
What do you know?

46:00.680 --> 46:02.444
Tell me what you know.

46:05.040 --> 46:06.690
Come a bit closer.

46:08.280 --> 46:09.611
Bastard.

46:09.800 --> 46:12.929
- What do you know?
- That I can screw you around.

49:10.960 --> 49:13.964
Everything is in the
car, so we can go.

49:17.640 --> 49:22.248
Jeff? Put your shoes on. And
turn the TV off. We're going.

49:42.680 --> 49:44.205
Mummy!

49:44.440 --> 49:46.681
Mummy! Mummy! Mummy!

49:46.880 --> 49:49.360
Mummy! No! Mummy!

50:16.360 --> 50:20.888
Iris speaking. Nick, I've got
Quireynen on the line. The DNA.

50:21.080 --> 50:22.650
I'll start matching it.

50:22.840 --> 50:27.243
We did our best but the sperm
sample came back with "no profile".

50:27.440 --> 50:32.890
It was a very delicate sample. There's a
procedure to replicate it up to 34 times

50:33.080 --> 50:35.686
but that takes a lot of time and
lab capacity and I doubt...

50:35.880 --> 50:38.804
Is it the same old story?
A load of crap about budgets?

50:39.000 --> 50:40.081
Permission...

50:40.280 --> 50:43.409
Permission? Do I have to ask
Robin's parents for permission?

50:43.600 --> 50:46.524
- Permission...
- Do I have to come and make you do it?

50:46.720 --> 50:52.682
But permission has been given. And we've
started but I doubt it will work.

50:56.760 --> 50:58.649
OK, I'm calm. Alright.

52:50.440 --> 52:53.569
Joff! Joff!

54:46.960 --> 54:48.291
Tara?

54:52.560 --> 54:53.721
Tara?

55:06.720 --> 55:08.370
Tara?

55:27.160 --> 55:28.286
Tara.

55:30.240 --> 55:31.321
Tara.

55:51.680 --> 55:54.126
Tara, come here.

55:59.480 --> 56:00.447
Tara.

56:04.920 --> 56:06.649
Tara, don't.

56:07.280 --> 56:08.884
Tara, come here.

01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:50.290
Come on, it's OK, it's OK.

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:51.641
It's OK.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.570
Where are his clothes?

01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:21.602
BIRTH/DEATH

01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:41.483
ACCOMPLICES

01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:40.771
Nancy?

01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:47.891
- Nancy?
- Who is it?

01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:50.090
Nancy Lammers?

01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:58.086
I got your address from a friend
of your brother's, of Ronny's.

01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:12.049
- Which friend?
- A pal from in prison. Ivan Plettinckx.

01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:13.442
Bloody cop!

01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:22.241
- Stop it. I just want to talk to you.
- I don't talk to cops. Fuck off!

01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:26.761
You touched my tits!
You tried to rape me!

01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:29.566
Don't provoke me. Don't provoke me!

01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:33.043
Calm down. Calm down.

01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:48.450
Plettinckx is probably involved in the
abduction and murder of a little boy.

01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:49.926
What do you know about it?

01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:53.770
- What do you know about it?
- I don't know anything.

01:03:55.880 --> 01:04:00.488
Ronny knew Plettinckx. All of them...
him and his lousy friends.

01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:04.965
Was there a biter among
those lousy friends? Eh?

01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:07.561
Someone who restrains
little boys with his teeth?

01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:12.730
- A biter, Nancy?
- I don't know any biters.

01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:19.485
The Plettinckx I know wasn't
a biter. Just a dirty old man.

01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:21.330
So you do know him?

01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:27.362
Did you ever see or make a
video in which a little boy...

01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:32.770
in which a little boy abducted
by Plettinckx was abused?

01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:38.649
- Bjorn.
- What is all this?

01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:43.444
First you go on about a biter.

01:04:43.640 --> 01:04:47.929
Then you talk about films
from a hundred years ago.

01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:05.606
- This isn't the last you've seen of me.
- Fuck off!

01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:29.600
Calm down, calm down.
It's OK. It's OK.

01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:35.520
- Nick isn't in?
- I can't reach him.

01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:38.450
I haven't seen him but my
number plate register was open.

01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:45.931
- What is that?
- I don't know. It was lying here.

01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:26.646
Help!

01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:29.804
Help!

01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:31.565
Help!

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:33.889
Help.

01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:36.841
Help!

01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:57.481
Nick? We're on to something.

01:06:57.680 --> 01:07:01.730
The bite gave us a clear impression
of the teeth. Male, older than 20.

01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:04.647
Mrs Nercessian is waiting for us.

01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:07.451
Alright.

01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:11.723
I'd like to have a more precise
picture of the Simons family,

01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:14.167
starting with Alex.

01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:17.250
Alex, the poor guy.

01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:20.364
He spends all day
wandering round the park.

01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:25.851
Hasn't Alex got a job?
How does he earn a living?

01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:29.520
I don't know if I should tell you.

01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:38.287
Alex was at loggerheads with lots
of families after marrying an odar.

01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:39.925
What is an odar?

01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:44.602
Well, Cindy is an odar.
You too, in fact.

01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:46.928
It's someone who isn't Armenian.

01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:49.562
Is Alex Simons Armenian?

01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:52.366
His grandfather and mine
fought the Turks together.

01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:54.688
Simons isn't an Armenian name.

01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:58.930
Simonian is. That's
his name in Armenian.

01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:03.762
In our community in Antwerp lots of
Armenians have changed their surname.

01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:05.526
- Simonian?
- Yes.

01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:07.161
Stay here.

01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:09.362
Simonian, Alerian.

01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:13.525
The guy was in prison for two years
for the indecent assault of a minor.

01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:17.011
- We should have checked.
- He was the victim, half-dead.

01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:19.845
- I should have checked.
- Did he tie himself up?

01:08:21.439 --> 01:08:24.011
It's possible. First his
feet, then his hands.

01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:28.569
- And hit himself over the head?
- That head wound was only superficial.

01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:31.962
We need the guy's DNA and
an impression of his teeth.

01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:35.249
Can you call the lab for the DNA?

01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:38.651
Is Alex Simons at your place?

01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:42.560
No, he's probably in the
park or at his own house.

01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:45.206
- He's finding it hard to cope.
- Thank you.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:39.765
I've seen you in the paper.
You're investigating that case.

01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:41.450
If you'll excuse me, I'm busy.

01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:44.041
Maybe we could...
I've got a theory.

01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:48.006
The Simons family was about to go away
for the weekend. You should ask yourself

01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:50.328
- if that is relevant.
- We already have.

01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:51.930
- Oh, OK.
- Will you excuse me?

01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:53.962
I was Robin's swimming teacher.

01:09:55.480 --> 01:09:57.721
Have you got information
about Robin?

01:09:57.960 --> 01:09:59.200
No.

01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:05.290
Um... has anyone said
anything about a troll?

01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:09.441
- What?
- The children are talking about one

01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:12.484
and I wondered if the police knew.

01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:15.570
Has one of your pupils seen a troll?
Come into contact with it?

01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:17.569
No, but... they talk about one.

01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:22.681
He climbs the wall at night and looks
in through their bedroom window.

01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:28.121
Right. Well... I'd be happy to have
you write all that information down.

01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:32.086
Feel free to contact us. If you'd excuse
me, I'm working on a theory of my own.

01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:34.806
- But the troll...
- Please stay behind the tape.

01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:40.047
Typical of the police. They always have
theories. But if someone else has...

01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:43.329
- I'd like you to stay behind the tape.
- They have to be Mr Big.

01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:46.683
That's it, don't listen to someone
who maybe knows something.

01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:56.250
I don't feel well. I can't
stand things in my mouth.

01:11:56.440 --> 01:11:59.330
We need that impression.
To eliminate suspects.

01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:02.364
- It won't take long.
- Do I have to explain in Armenian?

01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:05.888
Do you want to find your
son's murderer or not?

01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:09.687
Don't waste your time then. You've
wasted enough time already.

01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:13.886
What if another family is tied up
somewhere? Have you thought about that?

01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:16.487
What are you saying?
What are you trying to say?

01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:18.762
- The alginate is ready.
- He has to answer first.

01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:24.364
It has to go in now, it hardens
immediately. Open your mouth. OK.

01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:27.689
Take it easy. Take it easy.
It only takes a minute.

01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:33.603
Breathe through your nose.
Breathe calmly through your nose.

01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:44.683
What was that about another family?

01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:46.850
He needs to go to hospital.

01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:56.008
I have to do the right thing.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:06.650
I have to do the right thing.

01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:17.644
According to the lab, the DNA
matches that of Alex Simons.

01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:20.525
So his story about an intruder
is nothing but a lie.

01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:23.326
We need to check if there
is any history of abuse.

01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:26.364
We'll contact Robin's
teachers, doctors, friends.

01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:27.766
Let me deal with Simons.

01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:31.362
We will deal with him but he's too
weak now. He's not going anywhere.

01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:35.451
Now he's weak is a good time.
He wandered round that park for days.

01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:40.403
Go to that park. Ask if anyone saw him
there and where and what he was doing.

01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:23.489
- I'm an Indian. I'm an Indian.
- Later. Later.

01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:35.924
Do you remember the bad guy?
The bad guy who broke your head?

01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:39.004
- Ivan.
- Ivan, yes. Ivan and the rest?

01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:46.930
- Pl... Plet... Plettin...
- Plettinckx. Ivan Plettinckx.

01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:52.968
- Who took you in afterwards?
- Nancy.

01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:57.290
Nancy. Yes. As long as you know.

01:14:57.480 --> 01:15:03.726
If anyone ever asks you, never forget
to tell them who saved you. Eh?

01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:05.803
Who saved you?

01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:10.525
- Nancy.
- Nancy.

01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:15.246
Ronny and Nancy. Remember that.

01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:18.891
Yes. Where is my Indian?

01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:25.531
I washed your Indian.

01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:42.445
You have to stay here in this
caravan for a bit longer.

01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:45.325
I'm expecting some
visitors at home.

01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:53.842
I need to speak to Alex Simons.

01:15:55.480 --> 01:15:57.926
No visitors. Mr Simons
has a stomach ulcer.

01:15:58.120 --> 01:16:00.805
- Just one minute?
- He's developed peritonitis.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:05.608
He's full of antibiotics and Dr
Devriendt left explicit instructions.

01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:08.610
You've just arrived, eh?
Has your shift already started?

01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:11.280
Maybe you haven't read
those instructions yet.

01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:13.528
I really do need to
speak to Alex Simons.

01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:17.406
He knows something. It's so we can
prevent it happening to another child.

01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:35.727
Stop lying, pal.

01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:39.049
Listen carefully. I can't allow
it to happen to another child,

01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:42.881
so if you know something or are hiding
something, now is the time to say.

01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:47.250
Bloody hell.

01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:53.204
Tell me. Tell me then.

01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:57.204
Sorry, I got caught in the bag
of blood. It's OK. I just...

01:16:57.400 --> 01:16:59.641
- Leave, now!
- No, he's going to say something.

01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:02.047
- No.
- Say it.

01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:03.890
- Out.
- He's going to say something.

01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:05.764
Sir! Get out!

01:17:05.960 --> 01:17:07.291
Fuck you.

01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:10.969
- He needs blood.
- He was going to say something.

01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:35.884
I've got what you want to know.
I want the videos and something else.

01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:38.526
It's too late. We've found
the biter without you.

01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:43.851
I know something about the
other boy you referred to.

01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:46.811
He came on the scene later.

01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:12.369
Hey! Come on then, tell me. What do
you know? Eh? What do you know?

01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:15.965
- Who are you working for?
- What do you know?

01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:23.006
You're working for someone. Who is
so interested in Plettinckx's toy boy?

01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:28.650
- That's none of your business.
- Someone really, really wants to know.

01:18:28.840 --> 01:18:33.801
And if someone really, really wants
to know... there is money to be made.

01:18:34.520 --> 01:18:37.808
- In your dreams. In your dreams!
- 5,000 euros.

01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:42.204
And I'll tell you everything.

01:18:46.840 --> 01:18:48.080
D'you know what I'll do?

01:18:48.280 --> 01:18:52.763
I'll gill-wrap those videos and give
them to Vice. That's what I'll do.

01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:56.203
5,000 euros and the
videos disappear.

01:18:56.400 --> 01:18:59.847
- Fuck off.
- You don't know what you're missing.

01:19:00.920 --> 01:19:03.161
I can show you,
you stupid dickhead.

01:19:20.600 --> 01:19:21.965
Nancy?

01:19:24.120 --> 01:19:25.406
Nancy?

01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:28.690
3,000.

01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:03.810
Bloody hell.

01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:28.201
- I want to go home.
- Later.

01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:31.324
- I want to go home. I want to go home.
- Later. The visitors are coming.

01:20:31.520 --> 01:20:35.081
- I want to go.
- Calm down, calm down. Later.

01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:37.328
Let's play a game first. A game.

01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:40.923
Houdini, yes. Houdini. Yes.

01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:43.964
Houdini. Put your hands like this.

01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:48.287
Here we go... Houdini.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:01.050
Houdini. Houdini. Houdini.

01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:06.082
And if you're good, someone
will come specially to see you.

01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:10.171
Specially to see you. Right,
now try to get out of that.

01:22:14.640 --> 01:22:15.880
Nick?

01:22:23.840 --> 01:22:28.289
You've helped us arrest someone who had
the Vice Squad tearing their hair out.

01:22:28.480 --> 01:22:30.687
Almost all computers
seized from paedophiles

01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:34.089
had the same commercial
for Larry Films on them.

01:22:34.280 --> 01:22:37.011
The only clue is the tattoo
on the slut with the boys.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:43.562
We never found her. Or those films.
But you have, apparently.

01:22:44.360 --> 01:22:46.806
I found that heart in
Plettinckx's letters.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.480
I thought it may have
something to do with Bjorn.

01:22:50.480 --> 01:22:54.201
You checked her brother's number
plate. Was that in the letter too?

01:22:55.120 --> 01:22:58.408
It's a dead end. The guy is..
He is literally dead.

01:22:58.960 --> 01:23:02.009
If you're working on something,
Nick, don't exclude me.

01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:05.046
- I mean it.
- OK.

01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:09.686
You didn't call me.

01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:13.168
We had DNA quicker, the teeth
impression was no longer necessary.

01:23:13.360 --> 01:23:14.646
You can still invoice us.

01:23:15.560 --> 01:23:19.167
Don't I have to look at anything?
The impression of another set of teeth?

01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:22.842
Not for now. The DNA was
very clear... Alex Simons.

01:23:23.640 --> 01:23:28.680
Simons? Really? So who bit the boy?

01:23:28.920 --> 01:23:31.651
- What do you mean?
- It certainly wasn't Simons.

01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:35.083
I managed to save some of
the impression he spat out.

01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:38.363
It definitely doesn't
match that bite.

01:23:39.560 --> 01:23:43.042
Alex Simons didn't bite him.
The guy is still out there.

01:27:49.040 --> 01:27:50.565
Danni...

01:28:25.160 --> 01:28:26.161
So this was his lair.

01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:31.241
I saw the rubbish but was looking for a
kid. No one mentioned food leftovers.

01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:35.604
Christ. What have we
done to Alex Simons?

01:28:49.800 --> 01:28:50.801
Nick...

01:28:56.240 --> 01:28:59.767
It could be true. That the guy
climbs walls and stares in at kids.

01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:03.123
- Are we back to the troll?
- Someone told me about it in detail.

01:29:03.320 --> 01:29:07.689
- Check who was Robin's swimming teacher.
- OK.

01:29:07.880 --> 01:29:11.441
Nick, someone called Chris Gommaer
works at the swimming pool.

01:29:11.640 --> 01:29:14.484
The court has forbidden him
to contact his young son.

01:29:14.680 --> 01:29:17.650
He lives in Morckhoven Avenue.
Like in that old case.

01:29:17.880 --> 01:29:19.769
Mr Gommaer?

01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:27.246
It's alright, madam.
I've come to see him.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:30.411
Come on.

01:29:35.920 --> 01:29:37.684
Come on. Get out of the water.

01:30:46.040 --> 01:30:49.362
That's him, eh? That's your son.
That's Kenny, isn't it?

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:54.129
If your wife asks for you to
be kept away from your son

01:30:54.360 --> 01:30:56.806
and the court agrees, there
must be a reason. Eh?

01:30:57.520 --> 01:30:58.760
I'm not a paedophile.

01:31:01.200 --> 01:31:03.885
Kenny is the person I love
most in all the world.

01:31:04.760 --> 01:31:07.366
What would you call someone
who rapes children then?

01:31:11.720 --> 01:31:14.371
- He made me.
- What?

01:31:15.880 --> 01:31:17.450
He made me.

01:31:19.760 --> 01:31:22.161
- Who?
- The troll.

01:31:26.880 --> 01:31:28.245
Where is he?

01:31:29.080 --> 01:31:30.047
Is he inside you?

01:31:32.040 --> 01:31:33.565
We were ready to leave.

01:31:35.160 --> 01:31:36.286
All packed.

01:31:38.360 --> 01:31:40.169
Then he came in.

01:31:41.840 --> 01:31:43.126
Via the roof.

01:31:43.360 --> 01:31:46.284
- Do you know him?
- He's back.

01:31:47.320 --> 01:31:51.006
That was him. In Robin Simons'
house. That was him.

01:31:57.640 --> 01:32:01.531
Alex... what happened
at your house?

01:32:02.120 --> 01:32:05.408
We think we know but we
want you to tell us.

01:32:13.640 --> 01:32:18.089
We've found another victim.
He's told us everything.

01:32:25.640 --> 01:32:27.608
Were photos taken
in your house too?

01:32:37.480 --> 01:32:39.369
I can understand it isn't easy.

01:32:40.080 --> 01:32:43.846
I hope it happens to you
one day. I really do.

01:32:44.040 --> 01:32:46.168
That you have to make
the same choice.

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:49.923
What choice, Alex?

01:32:55.440 --> 01:32:57.044
What choice?

01:33:02.760 --> 01:33:06.128
He held a knife here.

01:33:10.720 --> 01:33:15.089
On... On Robin's stomach. He was
going to fillet him like a fish.

01:33:23.280 --> 01:33:26.011
It would have been better
if he'd killed us all.

01:33:39.160 --> 01:33:41.208
What those people
have been through...

01:33:42.680 --> 01:33:46.287
Then we turn up and drag
them through it again.

01:33:48.200 --> 01:33:52.171
I don't know if I believe he was
blindfolded the whole time.

01:33:52.360 --> 01:33:53.964
He remembers a lot of details.

01:33:54.640 --> 01:33:58.850
But if he was, Gommaer was the only one
to have caught a glimpse of this troll.

01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:00.769
That was ten years ago.

01:34:01.920 --> 01:34:03.524
We're no closer to finding him.

01:35:04.040 --> 01:35:07.283
- Frank, just one minute?
- You know it's not allowed, Nick.

01:35:07.480 --> 01:35:09.608
- One minute? Come on.
- Quickly then.

01:35:09.800 --> 01:35:11.325
Really quickly, eh?

01:35:14.600 --> 01:35:16.648
This isn't because of me. OK?

01:35:16.840 --> 01:35:19.081
- You gave them the videos.
- They've got nothing.

01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:22.842
- Just an old film from the internet.
- Yeah, right.

01:35:23.080 --> 01:35:28.689
Come here. You have to believe me.
I was on my way to see you, with money.

01:35:28.920 --> 01:35:32.288
Really. Come on, give me something.
What do you know about the biter?

01:35:32.800 --> 01:35:35.644
The biter? I thought you had him?

01:35:35.840 --> 01:35:38.161
Give me something.
A description. An age.

01:35:38.360 --> 01:35:42.445
Unmanageable. Bites.
Pisses everywhere.

01:35:42.640 --> 01:35:45.883
Plettinckx only had him with him
once. But what he looks like now...

01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:51.242
I know more about the other one.
Do you want to know about him?

01:35:51.440 --> 01:35:54.330
- Come on, Nick, finish it. We need to...
- Yeah, right away.

01:35:54.520 --> 01:35:58.923
I'll see if those videos don't surface
first. I'm in court in two days' time.

01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:04.286
If they've only got that old commercial,
they'll let me go, eh? Otherwise...

01:36:04.520 --> 01:36:06.249
Shame.

01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:09.969
- Come on, Nick. That's it. We're off.
- Shame.

01:36:10.240 --> 01:36:12.811
- Nick?
- A real shame.

01:36:14.360 --> 01:36:15.691
Fuck.

01:36:27.080 --> 01:36:28.570
Nancy!

01:36:35.520 --> 01:36:37.010
Nancy!

01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:43.890
Nancy!

01:37:04.960 --> 01:37:08.089
I know where the smell of urine
in the Simonses' house came from.

01:37:08.280 --> 01:37:11.602
Those red areas are sources of female
hormones. That's the cupboard.

01:37:11.920 --> 01:37:16.164
I think he disinfected them
with his own piss. Look.

01:37:17.880 --> 01:37:21.646
In this they say female
hormones cause impotence.

01:37:23.040 --> 01:37:24.326
Could that be his motive?

01:37:24.520 --> 01:37:29.970
Maybe bigger or... a nose that...
I can't see it there. I...

01:37:41.920 --> 01:37:45.129
- Did he touch your son himself?
- He couldn't.

01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:52.245
- He was impotent.
- Why didn't you report this?

01:37:55.360 --> 01:37:59.206
My wife thought that...
it was better for Kenny.

01:37:59.400 --> 01:38:03.883
That he isn't constantly...

01:38:04.080 --> 01:38:06.845
That he isn't
constantly reminded...

01:38:07.600 --> 01:38:13.164
But it didn't stop her taking
him I don't know where.

01:38:13.360 --> 01:38:17.285
But maybe... maybe
that is a good thing.

01:38:18.080 --> 01:38:23.211
Because... only a sick pervert
would make that choice,

01:38:23.400 --> 01:38:28.247
- a normal person would...
- What? Let his child die?

01:38:30.200 --> 01:38:32.521
- That's not a choice.
- He would have done it.

01:38:32.720 --> 01:38:38.124
He had used the same knife to...
slash a policewoman open once.

01:38:38.640 --> 01:38:40.244
That's what he said.

01:38:41.880 --> 01:38:45.327
I... I thought that maybe
he was arrested after that,

01:38:45.520 --> 01:38:49.605
because I combed the papers
for years to find something

01:38:49.800 --> 01:38:54.567
that resembled, if even only slightly,
what... what happened to us...

01:38:54.760 --> 01:38:56.171
Nothing.

01:39:01.680 --> 01:39:03.170
I'll be back.

01:39:03.800 --> 01:39:05.165
Iris?

01:39:05.560 --> 01:39:07.847
- Can you start your system up again?
- OK.

01:39:08.280 --> 01:39:13.730
Look for convictions for stabbing a
policewoman, go back to 2000, 2001.

01:40:45.400 --> 01:40:47.971
Hans! Hans!

01:40:49.320 --> 01:40:50.845
Hans!

01:40:52.400 --> 01:40:53.481
Hans!

01:40:59.080 --> 01:41:00.411
Where is Jeff?

01:41:11.840 --> 01:41:12.887
Joff...

01:41:14.360 --> 01:41:15.725
Jeff!

01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:19.561
Jeff!

01:41:24.600 --> 01:41:26.125
I've got a name.

01:41:29.040 --> 01:41:31.361
The guy was sectioned.

01:41:33.920 --> 01:41:37.208
Bloody hell. Right under
our nose. Come on.

01:41:52.680 --> 01:41:54.409
Police.

01:41:55.560 --> 01:41:56.925
Claeren?

01:42:07.360 --> 01:42:13.003
Pateet, call the lab. Wait downstairs
by the lift. And someone by the stairs.

01:42:33.600 --> 01:42:35.364
PROLACTIN - FEMALE TOXIN

01:42:46.040 --> 01:42:49.123
IMPOTENCE IS AN ATTACK
BY THE FEMALE HORMONE

01:42:59.200 --> 01:43:02.204
STOP MEDICATION
START OWN TREATMENT

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:28.240
Danni?

01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:35.729
I don't believe it...

01:43:38.040 --> 01:43:40.327
- I want to see the cellar.
- Christ.

01:44:38.840 --> 01:44:39.807
Oh God.

01:45:04.080 --> 01:45:06.003
That's all piss.

01:45:14.600 --> 01:45:18.969
They're clothes. Bloody hell,
the disgusting bastard!

01:45:23.200 --> 01:45:25.726
Patient fixated on delusion
that he is a new variety.

01:45:25.920 --> 01:45:29.606
The new stage in the evolution that
no longer has man's weaknesses.

01:45:29.800 --> 01:45:33.725
He sees his impotence as an attack by
female hormones to prevent evolution.

01:45:34.040 --> 01:45:37.010
Prolactins are female toxin.
It's heavy, falls to the ground.

01:45:37.200 --> 01:45:39.806
Everything was up off the
floor in his apartment.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:43.368
It's the highest building, the
highest apartment in the area.

01:45:43.560 --> 01:45:46.370
He'd hidden Robin
up high in a tree.

01:45:48.200 --> 01:45:50.885
Hold on, that can't be Robin.
Robin was tied to a stove.

01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:55.642
Bloody hell, look at that date.

01:46:05.440 --> 01:46:06.965
Alex?

01:46:10.440 --> 01:46:11.680
Ale...

01:46:14.240 --> 01:46:15.969
What are you doing here?

01:46:21.080 --> 01:46:22.605
You have to help me.

01:46:23.760 --> 01:46:27.685
Another family is now going through
the same hell. You have to help.

01:46:27.880 --> 01:46:29.928
You are the only one who can help me.

01:46:33.080 --> 01:46:35.128
Why do you think he chose you?

01:46:35.360 --> 01:46:37.840
Why you? Why your family? Why?

01:46:38.480 --> 01:46:43.805
Did you notice anything? In recent
weeks, recent days. Something. Anything.

01:46:46.720 --> 01:46:48.051
Come on.

01:46:56.520 --> 01:46:58.249
The smell in the house.

01:47:00.200 --> 01:47:03.807
The smell of... of piss
and something rotting.

01:47:04.760 --> 01:47:08.401
And... the bottles of
milk kept disappearing

01:47:08.600 --> 01:47:12.764
and we would find them right
at the bottom of the garden.

01:47:26.400 --> 01:47:27.367
No.

01:47:27.560 --> 01:47:30.530
I can't. No!

01:47:32.720 --> 01:47:33.926
Hans?

01:47:35.480 --> 01:47:36.242
No.

01:47:58.560 --> 01:48:00.130
Take his underpants off.

01:48:01.800 --> 01:48:05.441
- Take his underpants off.
- I can't.

01:48:05.640 --> 01:48:07.802
- Take his underpants off, I said.
- I can't.

01:48:09.880 --> 01:48:12.406
- Now take your trousers...
- No.

01:48:12.600 --> 01:48:14.841
Take your trousers off.

01:48:19.400 --> 01:48:20.845
Put it in him.

01:48:21.640 --> 01:48:22.971
- No.
- Put...

01:48:23.160 --> 01:48:24.161
No.

01:48:25.120 --> 01:48:27.771
- I can't do that.
- Put it bloody in him.

01:48:27.960 --> 01:48:29.803
- I can't do it.
- Put it in him, I said!

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:31.206
I can't do it.

01:48:37.120 --> 01:48:40.124
I can't do it. No. No.

01:48:40.440 --> 01:48:42.522
- No.
- Jeff? Jeff?

01:48:43.680 --> 01:48:44.602
No!

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.765
Prolactin, Goddammit! Prolactin.

01:49:05.600 --> 01:49:07.170
Help!

01:49:07.360 --> 01:49:08.361
Help!

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:13.368
Help! Help!

01:49:16.680 --> 01:49:18.250
Help!

01:49:23.400 --> 01:49:24.481
You bastard!

01:49:34.760 --> 01:49:37.286
Help!

01:49:38.960 --> 01:49:40.007
Help!

01:49:52.120 --> 01:49:53.724
The police are on their way.

01:50:32.560 --> 01:50:34.050
Hey!

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.685
Goddammit! Stop!

01:50:54.400 --> 01:50:56.641
Stop! Let go of him!

01:50:57.520 --> 01:50:59.045
Let go of that child.

01:51:02.840 --> 01:51:04.171
Let go of him.

01:51:08.040 --> 01:51:09.451
Let go of him.

01:51:14.920 --> 01:51:16.331
Let go of him.

01:51:22.360 --> 01:51:25.045
OK. OK. Now move aside.

01:51:28.240 --> 01:51:29.287
Move away from him.

01:51:31.680 --> 01:51:33.250
Go back.

01:51:34.600 --> 01:51:35.840
Go back.

01:51:57.000 --> 01:52:00.049
I need him. For the treatment.

01:52:05.400 --> 01:52:11.089
I'm entitled to treatment.
I... I'm entitled to treatment.

01:52:11.280 --> 01:52:13.647
I'm entitled to treatment!

01:53:42.520 --> 01:53:45.410
Hey, put that child down, Claeren!

01:53:45.680 --> 01:53:47.125
You can't get away.

01:53:57.800 --> 01:53:58.801
It's OK

01:54:04.040 --> 01:54:06.930
It'll be fine.
Everything will be fine.

01:54:13.160 --> 01:54:14.730
I'll be back. I'll be back.

01:54:17.600 --> 01:54:20.570
Can you hear them?
Can you hear the police?

01:54:23.800 --> 01:54:25.529
Claeren!

01:56:39.600 --> 01:56:40.931
No.

01:56:44.040 --> 01:56:45.690
Don't.

01:57:31.160 --> 01:57:32.127
It'll be fine.

01:58:38.520 --> 01:58:40.249
They are for you.

01:58:43.320 --> 01:58:47.006
They are enough to ensure Nancy Lammers
won't be released for the time being.

01:59:01.680 --> 01:59:03.364
You frighten me sometimes.

01:59:05.080 --> 01:59:09.449
Plettinckx wanted me to find
them. He led me to them.

01:59:11.600 --> 01:59:15.321
He wanted me to see, to know.

01:59:22.240 --> 01:59:26.564
She wanted... She wanted those
videos. She wanted money.

01:59:30.240 --> 01:59:31.890
Then she'd show me stuff.

01:59:34.720 --> 01:59:36.643
Do you know about Bjorn now?

01:59:50.160 --> 01:59:54.404
I've had enough.
I'm selling my house.

01:59:55.440 --> 01:59:56.726
It stops here.

02:00:10.880 --> 02:00:12.769
Nancy!

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:15.240
Nancy!
