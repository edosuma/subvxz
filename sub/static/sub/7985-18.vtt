00:00.479 --> 00:02.402
ABBY LEE:
<i>Previously on</i> Dance Moms...

00:02.402 --> 00:04.204
I'm not coming back
with my kids.

00:06.907 --> 00:07.875
ANNOUNCER:
Third place,

00:07.875 --> 00:09.643
"The Atlantic."
(cheering)

00:09.643 --> 00:11.578
Wow.
JESSALYNN: <i>We lost because</i>

00:11.578 --> 00:12.613
<i>Abby spent more time</i>

00:12.613 --> 00:13.814
<i>with the minis all week.</i>

00:13.814 --> 00:16.483
ABBY LEE:
Minis, we have a new member.

00:16.483 --> 00:17.618
TIFFANIE:
<i>This mini team is the future.</i>

00:17.618 --> 00:19.520
ANNOUNCER:
<i>First place,</i>

00:19.520 --> 00:20.287
"Just Like Mama Said."

00:20.287 --> 00:22.022
(whoops)

00:22.022 --> 00:24.024
KIRA:
She said you guys are trash.

00:24.024 --> 00:25.192
Who'd she call trash?
JESSALYNN: All of you.

00:25.192 --> 00:26.360
Trash! They're trash!

00:26.360 --> 00:27.528
LYNN:
I'm leaving.

00:29.229 --> 00:30.731
ABBY LEE:
<i>Coming up on</i> Dance Moms...

00:30.731 --> 00:33.433
<i>This is Maddie and Mackenzie's</i>
<i>last week.</i>

00:33.433 --> 00:34.701
MELISSA:
<i>I'm not really ready</i>

00:34.701 --> 00:36.136
for it to end.

00:36.136 --> 00:38.171
ABBY LEE:
<i>I have to focus on the future.</i>

00:38.171 --> 00:39.506
<i>That's all I have.</i>

00:39.506 --> 00:41.575
Abby's behavior is
the most disappointing.

00:41.575 --> 00:43.510
I need to really worry
about the kids that are here.

00:43.510 --> 00:46.980
TIFFANIE: <i>With Maddie and</i>
<i>Mackenzie leaving, I think Abby</i>

00:46.980 --> 00:48.715
is really seeing the potential
in this mini team.

00:48.715 --> 00:50.450
Ari, you are doing
a lyrical piece

00:50.450 --> 00:52.619
<i>dedicated to your brother.</i>

00:52.619 --> 00:54.621
MADDIE: <i>I really just want</i>
<i>to take the win</i>

00:54.621 --> 00:55.722
for my last solo on this team.

00:56.523 --> 00:58.191
Your kids will be nothing!

00:59.560 --> 01:02.596
♪ Livin' on the dance floor. ♪

01:02.596 --> 01:05.566
♪ ♪

01:11.271 --> 01:14.041
MELISSA: <i>Well, I'm an Abby Lee</i>
<i>supporter today!</i>

01:14.041 --> 01:15.275
JILL:
You cleaning out
your closets, Melissa?

01:15.275 --> 01:16.476
Are you getting rid of

01:16.476 --> 01:18.879
all your Abby Lee
stuff so you... (chuckles)

01:18.879 --> 01:20.380
... so you can start
fresh and clean?

01:20.380 --> 01:21.548
<i>This is our last week</i>

01:21.548 --> 01:24.952
with Melissa and her kids.

01:24.952 --> 01:27.955
I never ever, ever, ever thought
this day would come.

01:27.955 --> 01:32.492
<i>I can't imagine this team</i>
<i>without these girls.</i>

01:32.492 --> 01:35.495
But they're moving on,
this is what they want,

01:35.495 --> 01:37.197
<i>and we're gonna have</i>
<i>a good week.</i>

01:37.197 --> 01:38.732
JESSALYNN:
So what do you wish for,

01:38.732 --> 01:39.666
this week?

01:49.042 --> 01:50.844
That's easy wishes right there,
don't you think?

01:50.844 --> 01:52.512
Very easy.
And it would be nice,

01:52.512 --> 01:53.580
going into the last week

01:53.580 --> 01:55.482
that we could be on our

01:55.482 --> 01:58.585
absolute...
most fabulous behavior.

01:58.585 --> 02:00.487
KALANI:
Yeah.

02:00.487 --> 02:02.289
Well, they're not really
part of the team.

02:02.289 --> 02:03.290
MELISSA:
We just need
to ignore them.

02:03.290 --> 02:04.625
Just sayin'.

02:04.625 --> 02:05.759
<i>I think that Abby should let</i>

02:05.759 --> 02:08.295
just us compete this week.

02:08.295 --> 02:11.365
<i>I get that she has</i>
<i>these minis, great,</i>

02:11.365 --> 02:12.699
but it's our last week

02:12.699 --> 02:14.267
and it's supposed to be
about Maddie and Mackenzie,

02:14.267 --> 02:16.737
<i>and the mini moms,</i>
<i>they just stir up trouble.</i>

02:16.737 --> 02:18.472
JILL:
Let me just say,
this is Melissa

02:18.472 --> 02:19.706
and her kids'
last week.

02:20.807 --> 02:22.175
So let's just try
to just lay low

02:22.175 --> 02:24.277
and have a good week.

02:24.277 --> 02:26.546
I know it's a big week, with
Maddie and Mackenzie leaving,

02:26.546 --> 02:30.017
<i>but I feel</i>
<i>it's our week as well,</i>

02:30.017 --> 02:31.785
<i>because we keep losing</i>
<i>team members.</i>

02:31.785 --> 02:32.919
I'm leaving.

02:34.454 --> 02:37.057
SARI:
<i>So these four girls</i>
<i>need to step it up</i>

02:37.057 --> 02:39.259
and show Abby that they are

02:39.259 --> 02:41.728
<i>the mini team,</i>
<i>and the elite moms</i>

02:41.728 --> 02:42.663
need to get over it.

02:42.663 --> 02:44.131
ABBY LEE:
Let's go!

02:44.131 --> 02:45.298
It's pyramid time.

02:45.298 --> 02:46.733
We were at Sheer Talent

02:46.733 --> 02:48.035
in Fresno, California.

02:48.035 --> 02:49.736
The only group
that won

02:49.736 --> 02:51.905
were the minis!

02:51.905 --> 02:54.207
(cheers, applause)

02:54.207 --> 02:57.377
<i>I thought it was fun,</i>
<i>I thought it was sassy.</i>

02:57.377 --> 03:00.280
So we're gonna do
head shots tomorrow.

03:00.280 --> 03:03.116
JESSALYNN:
So, if you're doing head shots
for the minis, does this mean

03:03.116 --> 03:05.385
they're a team
and they're your new team?

03:05.385 --> 03:06.953
Well, they... they could be.

03:06.953 --> 03:08.622
MADDIE:
But I don't think

03:08.622 --> 03:11.792
anybody can fully replace us

03:11.792 --> 03:13.460
because we were the original...

03:13.460 --> 03:15.162
We're not trying
to replace anybody, though.

03:15.162 --> 03:16.563
ABBY LEE:
So you think that

03:16.563 --> 03:18.065
we shouldn't replace you,
we should just all

03:18.065 --> 03:19.933
throw in the towel 'cause you're
throwing in the towel?

03:21.101 --> 03:23.036
MELISSA:
She's not throwing
in the towel!

03:23.036 --> 03:24.337
Maddie's not
throwing in the towel.

03:24.337 --> 03:25.706
MADDIE:
No, you...

03:25.706 --> 03:27.040
you do whatever you want,
it's your team.

03:27.040 --> 03:29.443
I'm just saying, like...

03:29.443 --> 03:31.178
JESSALYNN:
She's saying,
and we‐‐ I agree,

03:31.178 --> 03:32.979
there will never be another
Maddie, Mackenzie, or Melissa.

03:32.979 --> 03:34.214
Like, never!

03:34.214 --> 03:35.916
ABBY LEE:
But...

03:35.916 --> 03:38.585
there's other stars.

03:38.585 --> 03:40.721
Life goes on.

03:40.721 --> 03:43.690
Had Melissa had
her kids in any one

03:43.690 --> 03:46.193
of the five
studios within,

03:46.193 --> 03:49.362
you know, a stone's throw
from my studio,

03:49.362 --> 03:52.099
these two kids wouldn't
be here right now.

03:52.099 --> 03:54.234
I am the vehicle

03:54.234 --> 03:56.536
to get these kids

03:56.536 --> 03:58.805
from their average,

03:58.805 --> 04:00.874
middle‐class, humdrum lives

04:00.874 --> 04:03.577
in Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania

04:03.577 --> 04:05.245
to the Great
White Way.

04:05.245 --> 04:06.279
And I did that.

04:07.814 --> 04:09.783
HOLLY:
<i>Yeah.</i>

04:09.783 --> 04:11.017
Awkward.

04:11.017 --> 04:12.519
So awkward

04:12.519 --> 04:14.321
<i>and embarrassing.</i>

04:15.789 --> 04:17.657
I think Abby resents the fact

04:17.657 --> 04:19.259
<i>that Maddie and Mackenzie</i>
<i>are leaving.</i>

04:19.259 --> 04:20.994
Abby's had to say good‐bye
to too many things:

04:20.994 --> 04:22.796
<i>her mother, her dog...</i>

04:22.796 --> 04:24.464
<i>It's just...</i>
<i>I think it's a lot.</i>

04:24.464 --> 04:26.133
I think it's too much for her.

04:26.133 --> 04:27.834
<i>So she's lashing out.</i>

04:29.636 --> 04:31.104
On the bottom of the pyramid...

04:36.777 --> 04:38.478
Brynn.

04:38.478 --> 04:40.647
<i>You got third place.</i>

04:43.583 --> 04:45.919
Next, we have Kendall.

04:45.919 --> 04:48.789
You <i>don't pay attention to</i>
<i>details in the choreography.</i>

04:50.423 --> 04:52.225
Next, we have JoJo.

04:52.225 --> 04:54.594
I still think
you have work to do

04:54.594 --> 04:58.331
<i>on your lyrical quality</i>
<i>of your dancing.</i>

04:58.331 --> 04:59.332
<i>Next,</i>

04:59.332 --> 05:00.967
we have Nia.

05:00.967 --> 05:01.935
Nia, uh...

05:01.935 --> 05:04.471
I thought you were good.

05:04.471 --> 05:07.107
Other people were better.

05:07.107 --> 05:09.843
Next, we have Mackenzie.

05:09.843 --> 05:14.114
<i>You tried really hard not</i>
<i>to look like a little kid.</i>

05:14.114 --> 05:15.182
You did well.

05:15.182 --> 05:17.117
Next, we have Kalani.

05:17.117 --> 05:20.120
<i>Kalani... outstanding</i>
<i>in the group routine.</i>

05:20.120 --> 05:23.757
On top of the pyramid: Maddie.

05:23.757 --> 05:24.758
Uh...

05:24.758 --> 05:27.027
(applause)

05:27.027 --> 05:29.262
<i>I tried to create a winner</i>

05:29.262 --> 05:31.832
<i>for the past six years.</i>

05:31.832 --> 05:32.933
I did that.

05:34.701 --> 05:35.836
ASHLEE: <i>I wasn't surprised</i>
<i>Brynn was at the bottom.</i>

05:35.836 --> 05:37.637
<i>She came in third,</i>

05:37.637 --> 05:40.006
so I knew Abby was
not gonna be happy with that.

05:40.006 --> 05:41.441
<i>However, Maddie came in fourth</i>

05:41.441 --> 05:43.276
<i>and she was at the top, so...</i>

05:43.276 --> 05:45.412
I'm not quite sure
how that makes sense,

05:45.412 --> 05:47.848
but... I got to pick my battles.

05:47.848 --> 05:50.350
ABBY LEE:
This week, we are going to

05:50.350 --> 05:54.387
Riverside, California to attend
New York Dance Experience.

05:54.387 --> 05:56.122
Now, you know

05:56.122 --> 05:58.291
this is the competition where

05:58.291 --> 06:00.493
they slap you in the face
with those critiques...

06:01.595 --> 06:03.096
... right after
you finish dancing.

06:03.096 --> 06:06.533
Uh... there's gonna be
incredible kids there.

06:07.868 --> 06:09.970
We really need to bring it.

06:09.970 --> 06:13.807
You will do a hip‐hop routine
in the competition this weekend.

06:13.807 --> 06:15.809
(wild cheering)

06:16.977 --> 06:18.912
ABBY LEE:
<i>If I was going to create</i>

06:18.912 --> 06:21.214
a landmark routine,

06:21.214 --> 06:23.283
chances are
it wouldn't be hip‐hop.

06:23.283 --> 06:26.419
<i>But the kids love it.</i>

06:26.419 --> 06:28.722
<i>It's Maddie and</i>
<i>Mackenzie's last week,</i>

06:28.722 --> 06:31.091
and if that's what
they wanted to do, so be it.

06:31.091 --> 06:35.729
The name of your routine
is "The Boss Ladies."

06:35.729 --> 06:37.931
But just remember,

06:37.931 --> 06:39.432
you're not the boss of me.

06:39.432 --> 06:41.902
I am the boss of you.

06:41.902 --> 06:43.103
Mackenzie, you have
a solo this week.

06:43.103 --> 06:45.639
(cheers, applause)

06:45.639 --> 06:48.909
The name of your routine
is called "Hero."

06:48.909 --> 06:51.144
It is, of course,
a jazz acrobatic routine.

06:53.346 --> 06:54.814
(laughing)
Maddie, you will perform

06:54.814 --> 06:56.182
the second solo.

06:56.182 --> 06:57.584
(applause)

06:57.584 --> 06:59.586
The name of your piece

06:59.586 --> 07:01.955
is "Hostage."

07:01.955 --> 07:04.391
The mini group

07:04.391 --> 07:06.793
will be doing a jazz routine

07:06.793 --> 07:09.696
entitled "Kiss Kiss."

07:09.696 --> 07:10.797
Now, Kendall,

07:10.797 --> 07:13.266
you did a "Kiss" dance
years ago.

07:13.266 --> 07:14.668
♪ Kiss, kiss, baby ♪

07:14.668 --> 07:16.536
♪ Gonna miss this, baby ♪

07:16.536 --> 07:18.071
♪ I'll see ya... ♪

07:18.071 --> 07:19.973
We are using that same music.

07:19.973 --> 07:21.508
GROUP:
Oh...

07:21.508 --> 07:22.842
ABBY LEE:
And so you are familiar.

07:22.842 --> 07:24.778
You will be assisting Gianna

07:24.778 --> 07:26.746
with the details.

07:26.746 --> 07:28.381
JILL:
<i>I would not have</i>
<i>invited the minis</i>

07:28.381 --> 07:31.718
to come back for Maddie
and Mackenzie's last week.

07:31.718 --> 07:34.321
<i>But if Abby wants Kendall</i>
<i>to work with the minis,</i>

07:34.321 --> 07:37.624
<i>that means Abby sees</i>
<i>the potential in Kendall</i>

07:37.624 --> 07:39.259
<i>to lead the team</i>

07:39.259 --> 07:40.794
<i>when Maddie's not around.</i>

07:40.794 --> 07:42.629
That's what I'm hoping for.

07:42.629 --> 07:45.065
ABBY LEE:
Last, but certainly not least,

07:45.065 --> 07:46.700
Ari, you are doing
a lyrical piece

07:46.700 --> 07:48.702
dedicated to your brother.

07:48.702 --> 07:50.236
Sari, do you mind sharing

07:50.236 --> 07:52.105
with everybody your son's story?

07:56.309 --> 07:58.311
Sorry, it's really sad.

07:59.779 --> 08:01.381
I'm not a sad person,
but this...

08:01.381 --> 08:04.851
this is where it's hard for me.

08:06.419 --> 08:08.288
So, I had my son,
and at three months exactly,

08:08.288 --> 08:10.056
he had open‐heart surgery,

08:10.056 --> 08:13.493
and, um, six days post‐op
he went into cardiac arrest.

08:13.493 --> 08:15.028
He suffered
from anoxic

08:15.028 --> 08:18.431
brain injury,
so he was actually dead

08:18.431 --> 08:19.766
for almost an hour.

08:19.766 --> 08:20.767
And now
he doesn't walk,

08:20.767 --> 08:22.736
he doesn't talk.

08:24.104 --> 08:26.072
I know that God
gave my daughter

08:26.072 --> 08:27.741
a gift to dance,
and...

08:27.741 --> 08:30.010
it would be different
if she was just

08:30.010 --> 08:32.579
an average dancer,
I wouldn't do all this.

08:32.579 --> 08:33.980
But it makes me happy.

08:33.980 --> 08:35.949
I need something
that helps me to be happy, too.

08:35.949 --> 08:37.650
(choked up):
Right.

08:37.650 --> 08:41.421
Let's tell a beautiful story
that's Jordan's.

08:41.421 --> 08:43.356
Okay?

08:43.356 --> 08:45.692
SARI:
<i>I've made a lot of sacrifices</i>
<i>to have Ari here.</i>

08:45.692 --> 08:47.827
It's not easy when you have
a child at home

08:47.827 --> 08:49.496
that needs 24‐hour day care,

08:49.496 --> 08:51.264

17:06.459 --> 17:08.127
Make this nice and low.

17:08.127 --> 17:11.797
Boom, boom... boom.

17:11.797 --> 17:13.799
Pow, pow.

17:13.799 --> 17:15.568
Maddie and Kenzie's last number,
Abby's not even teaching it.

17:15.568 --> 17:17.136
She doesn't care.

17:17.136 --> 17:18.671
ASHLEE:
Aren't you kind of glad

17:18.671 --> 17:21.707
that you're not gonna have
to deal with <i>that</i> anymore?

17:21.707 --> 17:23.709
JESSALYNN:
Yeah, you know you are.

17:23.709 --> 17:25.678
We'll have to hear of it,
you won't have to hear of it.

17:25.678 --> 17:27.680
I think that Abby
should be involved

17:27.680 --> 17:30.016
in choreographing
this week's group dance.

17:30.016 --> 17:32.985
<i>This is the last group dance</i>
<i>with Maddie and Mackenzie.</i>

17:32.985 --> 17:35.454
<i>Why isn't she doing it?</i>

17:35.454 --> 17:36.756
And most importantly,

17:36.756 --> 17:38.624
why isn't Melissa saying
anything to Abby about this?

17:38.624 --> 17:42.962
But Melissa has chosen
to not address the situation

17:42.962 --> 17:44.363
and pretend that
it doesn't exist.

17:44.363 --> 17:46.032
<i>It's just a matter of time.</i>

17:46.032 --> 17:48.401
<i>Something's gonna happen</i>
<i>that's gonna make Melissa snap.</i>

17:48.401 --> 17:49.902
<i>It's inevitable.</i>

17:49.902 --> 17:53.573
ABBY LEE: All right, now,
you are doing a lyrical solo.

17:53.573 --> 17:54.640
"For My Brother."

17:54.640 --> 17:57.443
It has to be amazing.

17:57.443 --> 17:59.111
Can't go out there and do
a dance for your brother

17:59.111 --> 18:01.447
and not win. Yes?

18:01.447 --> 18:03.849
<i>This is gonna be</i>
<i>a really emotional solo</i>

18:03.849 --> 18:05.084
<i>that you have to portray.</i>

18:05.084 --> 18:06.552
You have to do it
with your emotion.

18:06.552 --> 18:08.521
<i>Make it your own. All right?</i>

18:08.521 --> 18:11.490
So when you step out onstage,
you need to set the tone.

18:11.490 --> 18:12.825
You need to tell the judges,

18:12.825 --> 18:14.860
"This is serious,
pay attention to me,"

18:14.860 --> 18:17.530
<i>and really your inside story</i>
<i>about your brother</i>

18:17.530 --> 18:19.999
<i>and how it feels at home,</i>
<i>all right?</i>

18:19.999 --> 18:21.334
Yes? Okay.

18:21.334 --> 18:23.269
So let's get working.

18:23.269 --> 18:24.804
<i>Ari, she's only ten,</i>

18:24.804 --> 18:28.140
<i>but she dances older,</i>
<i>she acts older,</i>

18:28.140 --> 18:31.143
<i>she speaks older,</i>
<i>and she has to be,</i>

18:31.143 --> 18:35.581
<i>because there's always</i>
<i>going to be somebody</i>

18:35.581 --> 18:38.117
that needs more care than her,

18:38.117 --> 18:41.454
<i>her big brother, someone that</i>
<i>you're supposed to look up to.</i>

18:41.454 --> 18:45.891
<i>What is it like when you have</i>
<i>to care for that person?</i>

18:45.891 --> 18:48.227
And I think that's
why she dances maturely,

18:48.227 --> 18:50.229
and I wanted to give her
the opportunity

18:50.229 --> 18:53.566
<i>to tell this story and let</i>
<i>other people into her world.</i>

18:53.566 --> 18:55.968
ABBY LEE:
Better.

18:55.968 --> 18:58.904
That's really neat that you got
the solo this week for your son.

18:58.904 --> 19:00.339

19:05.077 --> 19:07.446

19:07.446 --> 19:08.948
Ari was nervous,
but I think that... I think

19:08.948 --> 19:11.217
that this is definitely
something that she can...

19:11.217 --> 19:12.918

19:12.918 --> 19:15.221

Sari, you were talking

19:20.826 --> 19:22.862

your disabled son was,

19:22.862 --> 19:24.664
coming down here to watch

This is a big order

26:12.137 --> 26:13.605
Areana?

26:13.605 --> 26:15.140
When you're out on that stage,

26:15.140 --> 26:17.643
people are gonna
look at you and think

26:17.643 --> 26:19.845
are you as good as Mackenzie
when she was that age?

26:19.845 --> 26:21.013

26:21.013 --> 26:22.714
Now remember,
when you do something

26:22.714 --> 26:25.017
that's epic and it's a story,
it takes a lot more thought

26:25.017 --> 26:28.053
than doing a hip and a hip
and a leg and a kick.

26:30.122 --> 26:32.491

26:37.729 --> 26:39.998
in dance and acting

55:25.789 --> 55:27.124
(quietly):
No.

55:27.124 --> 55:31.562
RAK: And these girls have been
glorious role models.

55:31.562 --> 55:33.497
All of them. All of them.

55:38.335 --> 55:40.003
I want to say one thing.

55:40.003 --> 55:44.308
Abby always said that everyone
is replaceable, right?

55:44.308 --> 55:46.677
And she always said that.

55:46.677 --> 55:48.412
I've heard her say it for years,

55:48.412 --> 55:51.915
and I'm gonna say
I completely disagree,

55:51.915 --> 55:54.818
because these girls
are irreplaceable.

55:54.818 --> 55:57.154
And they are wonderful.

55:57.154 --> 55:59.690
And we celebrate you.

55:59.690 --> 56:01.458
Melissa, I'd like you
to come up here, please.

56:01.458 --> 56:03.627
So make your way
to the stage.

56:05.295 --> 56:06.730
Come here.

56:06.730 --> 56:08.298
How are you, Melissa?

56:08.298 --> 56:09.633
Struggling a little bit.

56:09.633 --> 56:10.801
RAK:
Struggling a little bit.

56:10.801 --> 56:12.669
Anything you want
to say from your heart,

56:12.669 --> 56:13.904
having these two
wonderful girls?

56:13.904 --> 56:15.839
MELISSA (voice breaking):
I'll try.

56:18.208 --> 56:20.210
I just want to thank...
(sniffles)

56:21.845 --> 56:23.347
Breathe.

56:23.347 --> 56:24.848
...Abby,

56:24.848 --> 56:28.452
for everything you've done
for my kids through the years,

56:28.452 --> 56:30.787
and Gia, I adore you
like a daughter.

56:36.126 --> 56:37.961
I'm sorry, I just...

56:37.961 --> 56:39.963
Maddie's gonna
take it from there.
Maddie can take it.

56:39.963 --> 56:44.001
I just want to thank Abby, Gia
and all of my other dance moms,

56:44.001 --> 56:46.003
and all the girls.

56:46.003 --> 56:47.938
RAK:
Very good.

56:47.938 --> 56:49.940
Mackenzie.

56:49.940 --> 56:53.510
Well, I also want
to thank them too,

56:53.510 --> 56:56.113
but it's just really hard
to leave but...

56:56.113 --> 56:57.781
(sniffles)
I can't.

56:57.781 --> 56:59.783
Thank you.

56:59.783 --> 57:01.551
Well, we just want
you to know

57:01.551 --> 57:03.220
that your life has
been shared with us,

57:03.220 --> 57:04.621

our lives forever.

57:04.621 --> 57:06.623

MACKENZIE: <i>I'm really choked up</i>

57:13.830 --> 57:15.332
what I really wanted to say

57:15.332 --> 57:17.968
was I wanted to thank all

57:17.968 --> 57:19.403
<i>my best friends and sisters,</i>

57:19.403 --> 57:23.140

This is a festive time.

59:04.708 --> 59:07.544
And, uh, I'm glad you got
to dance with this team.

59:07.544 --> 59:09.146
All right, so, hey.

59:09.146 --> 59:10.814
We didn't do...

59:10.814 --> 59:12.482
One, two, three.

ABBY LEE: <i>These kids will be</i>
<i>official members of the ALDC.</i>

59:17.888 --> 59:19.389
<i>Absolutely. But...</i>

59:19.389 --> 59:21.191
<i>no way</i>
<i>are they a finished product.</i>

59:21.191 --> 59:24.428
<i>I expect these kids</i>
<i>to train, train, train,</i>

59:24.428 --> 59:27.097
<i>so that they can</i>
<i>start out next season</i>

59:27.097 --> 59:30.067
<i>looking like</i>
<i>the ALDC should look.</i>

59:30.067 --> 59:32.702
Like I say, getting
to the top is one thing,

59:32.702 --> 59:34.771
but staying there is another.

59:34.771 --> 59:36.640
Do you want to

59:36.640 --> 59:38.041
before they walk

59:38.041 --> 59:39.743
I don't really have

59:39.743 --> 59:40.777
final words, because...

59:40.777 --> 59:42.179
KENDALL:
There's nothing final.

59:42.179 --> 59:45.582
...there's no...
there's no finale, let's say.

59:45.582 --> 59:48.418
What about words
for the next chapter?

59:50.887 --> 59:52.823
ABBY LEE:
We're gonna have a little break.

59:52.823 --> 59:54.624
You need to practice.

59:54.624 --> 59:55.992
You need to continue
to work hard.

59:55.992 --> 59:57.461
What I expect of you

59:57.461 --> 1:00:00.297
is... legs straight,

1:00:00.297 --> 1:00:04.234
feet pointed, hyperextended,
shoulders down, ribs closed.

1:00:04.234 --> 1:00:07.237
Everybody's gonna grow
a little taller.

1:00:07.237 --> 1:00:08.738
A little leaner.

1:00:08.738 --> 1:00:11.141
I think what I'm looking
forward to is...

1:00:11.141 --> 1:00:12.242
<i>a break.</i>

1:00:12.242 --> 1:00:13.910
<i>It's a time to regroup,</i>

1:00:13.910 --> 1:00:17.948
<i>it's a time to be</i>
<i>rejuvenated, if you will,</i>

1:00:17.948 --> 1:00:20.817
to reconsider my options

1:00:20.817 --> 1:00:22.886
<i>and what the future</i>
<i>holds for me.</i>

1:00:22.886 --> 1:00:26.656
<i>I think it's a time</i>
<i>for all of that.</i>

1:00:26.656 --> 1:00:28.325
You know, what do they say?

1:00:28.325 --> 1:00:31.027
"There's a time to laugh
and a time to dance."

1:00:31.027 --> 1:00:35.031
Uh, Maddie, Mackenzie,
you did solos for the ALDC.

1:00:35.031 --> 1:00:37.634
As your teacher...

1:00:37.634 --> 1:00:38.935
I saw mistakes.

1:00:38.935 --> 1:00:40.203
Really?

1:00:40.203 --> 1:00:42.372
Maddie, when you stepped
out on stage,

1:00:42.372 --> 1:00:45.308
I feel like you weren't sure
if your head was down,

1:00:45.308 --> 1:00:47.978
or you were looking straight
where you were walking,

1:00:47.978 --> 1:00:49.980
or you were supposed
to turn front

1:00:49.980 --> 1:00:52.649
and really play it up.

1:00:52.649 --> 1:00:55.018
Mackenzie...

1:00:55.018 --> 1:00:58.021
on this, uh, gyrating,
pulsing section,

1:00:58.021 --> 1:01:00.490
that is your moment
to really strut out there.

1:01:00.490 --> 1:01:03.493
Uh, I really didn't see that.

1:01:03.493 --> 1:01:05.929
JESSALYNN:
They did very well today.

1:01:05.929 --> 1:01:07.297
HOLLY: They did.
Did great.

1:01:10.367 --> 1:01:11.701
Where are you going?

1:01:11.701 --> 1:01:14.804
HOLLY: Why? Is there
something you want to say?

1:01:14.804 --> 1:01:17.307
As their last time they're
walking out the door?

1:01:17.307 --> 1:01:19.075
That was it.

1:01:22.812 --> 1:01:24.648
JILL:
Melissa, how are you feeling?

1:01:24.648 --> 1:01:26.249
MELISSA:
Oh, you know what,

1:01:26.249 --> 1:01:29.286
I'm not... uh, I don't know what
you're talking about, but...

1:01:31.188 --> 1:01:33.123
JILL:
I think you need

1:01:33.123 --> 1:01:34.858
some more communication
between the two of you.

1:01:34.858 --> 1:01:36.526
JESSALYNN:
You need a lot more...

1:01:36.526 --> 1:01:37.427
What? What are you saying?

1:01:37.427 --> 1:01:38.428
Talk to your friend.

1:01:38.428 --> 1:01:40.063
I'm saying talk to your friend!

1:01:40.063 --> 1:01:41.631
Talk to your friend!

1:01:41.631 --> 1:01:44.000
She should be grateful.

1:01:44.000 --> 1:01:46.736
What, this was supposed
to be a happy thing.

1:01:46.736 --> 1:01:48.405
What's going on?
Just wrap it up!

1:01:48.405 --> 1:01:49.573

1:01:51.575 --> 1:01:53.276
<i>Overall...</i>

1:01:53.276 --> 1:01:58.515

1:01:58.515 --> 1:02:00.517
<i>exciting, adventurous.</i>

1:02:00.517 --> 1:02:03.320
More good times

1:02:06.289 --> 1:02:07.624
Nope.

1:02:07.624 --> 1:02:08.625
I don't want to say anything.

1:02:08.625 --> 1:02:09.626
I'm good.

1:02:11.528 --> 1:02:13.196
I'm great.

1:02:16.199 --> 1:02:17.834
Just sayin'.

1:02:17.834 --> 1:02:19.803
She's mad.

1:02:19.803 --> 1:02:21.438
Yeah, she needs
to talk with Abby.

1:02:21.438 --> 1:02:23.106
HOLLY: That's what she...
that's what I keep telling her.

1:02:23.106 --> 1:02:25.108
She needs to talk to her.
They really needed
to sit down and talk,

1:02:25.108 --> 1:02:27.043
and that's what we were saying,
but she doesn't want to hear it.

1:02:27.043 --> 1:02:29.379
She really doesn't
want to hear it.
HOLLY:
She started to tear up.

1:02:29.379 --> 1:02:31.748
HOLLY: You saw that.
JILL: She doesn't
want to hear it.

1:02:31.748 --> 1:02:34.317
They were Abby's favorites, and
Abby never wanted to show up,

1:02:34.317 --> 1:02:35.885
<i>so I can only imagine what</i>

1:02:35.885 --> 1:02:37.587
<i>the future holds</i>
<i>for this team, you know?</i>

1:02:37.587 --> 1:02:41.591
But... we have
to stand strong.

1:02:41.591 --> 1:02:43.293
These kids have worked too hard

1:02:43.293 --> 1:02:45.962
<i>and come too far</i>
<i>to let it all crumble.</i>

1:02:45.962 --> 1:02:48.064
<i>To the best of my ability,</i>

1:02:48.064 --> 1:02:49.633
I'm not gonna let that happen.

1:02:49.633 --> 1:02:51.935
We pretend like
everything's okay,

1:02:51.935 --> 1:02:53.436
and everything's not okay.

1:02:53.436 --> 1:02:55.071
Do you know what?

1:02:55.071 --> 1:02:57.107
This is where it leaves us.

1:02:57.107 --> 1:02:59.776
JESSALYNN:
Well, she made it all the way
to the end without being direct.

1:02:59.776 --> 1:03:01.544

the Zieglers were leaving

1:03:17.594 --> 1:03:20.030
They would not have
