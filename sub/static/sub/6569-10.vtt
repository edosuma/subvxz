No, you weren't. None of that is
true. What are you talking about?

04:20.406 --> 04:23.741

- You told me you'd midwife me through this campaign.

04:23.792 --> 04:25.576

- Yeah.

08:21.074 --> 08:22.658
- I haven't decided.
- Oh, all right.

08:22.692 --> 08:24.160
Well, it's just 'cause,
you know, we happen to have

08:24.194 --> 08:25.611
a position for you on our team.

08:25.613 --> 08:29.782
No fucking way! What? Oh, God.

08:29.833 --> 08:31.033
We just need you to deny to the press

08:31.084 --> 08:32.784
that the Chung torture
rumor came from our office.

08:32.787 --> 08:34.620
So, you want me to lie?

08:34.621 --> 08:35.955
Yeah.

08:35.957 --> 08:37.423
But, Dan...

08:37.457 --> 08:40.626
I've never told a lie in my life.

08:40.628 --> 08:43.294
That was a lie. Try to keep up, Egan.

08:43.297 --> 08:45.464
The rumor is the rumor
came from us, all right?

08:45.466 --> 08:48.300
So you just say that you got it from
the Web and the Web can't be trusted.

08:48.302 --> 08:50.553
- I can't do that. The Web made me.
- (Phone ringing)

08:50.604 --> 08:53.305
I can't denounce it. That's like
Peter denouncing Christ or worse.

08:53.307 --> 08:56.692
Hold on a sec. Hello? Dan Egan. West Wing.

08:57.978 --> 09:00.229
What's up, Rachel? How are you?

09:01.281 --> 09:02.898
I would love to go for margaritas.

09:02.949 --> 09:05.818
Just to warn you, though...
I do like to lick the rim.

09:05.869 --> 09:07.403
Okay, bye.

09:07.454 --> 09:10.406
- Who was that?
- Oh, uh, do you know Rachel Marsh?

09:10.457 --> 09:13.242
Red-hot Rachel from the Speaker's Office?

09:13.293 --> 09:14.743
"Three-pack-of-Kleenex"
Rachel?

09:14.795 --> 09:16.328
Yeah, I know Rachel.

09:16.330 --> 09:19.331
What can I say? West Wing
perks, buddy. So you in?

09:19.382 --> 09:21.383
- How much time do I have to think about it?
- Two seconds.

09:21.418 --> 09:23.085
- I'm in.
- Great.

09:27.924 --> 09:29.175
Sir, what are you doing in here?

09:29.226 --> 09:31.977
- This is not your manhole.
- I'm moving in.

09:32.012 --> 09:35.314
No, you're not. You need a
bigger office... that's far away.

09:35.348 --> 09:37.183
This is prime real estate.
I couldn't be any closer

09:37.185 --> 09:41.187
to the Oval Office if I had...
by some triumph of common sense...

09:41.189 --> 09:44.356
- a desk actually in it.
- I don't want your office next to mine.

09:44.358 --> 09:46.659
I do not want you on top of me.

09:46.693 --> 09:48.244
Well, I'm going to be. So, work with it.

09:48.278 --> 09:49.829
Wait a second. What are you doing in here?

09:49.863 --> 09:52.865
This is my office. See? My
calculator's on the desk.

09:52.916 --> 09:54.500
No, Selina said this is gonna be my office.

09:54.534 --> 09:56.785
You don't need an office. You have a bag.

09:56.837 --> 09:59.788
<i>- Okay, that's bullying.
- Well, why don't you take it up with the president?</i>

09:59.840 --> 10:01.624
- Guys...
- Kent: Why don't you call the Chief Justice

10:01.675 --> 10:04.627
- and get them both in?
- And so it begins.

10:04.678 --> 10:07.046
Actually, it really does. We've gotta go.

10:07.097 --> 10:08.430
Gary: She's about to ascend.

10:09.933 --> 10:11.550
<i>Female reporter: It will
be a low-key swearing-in...</i>

10:11.601 --> 10:14.019

10:21.395 --> 10:23.112
(camera shutters clicking)

10:23.146 --> 10:26.899
- I'm so proud of you, Mom.
- Oh, honey bunny. Thank you so much.

10:26.901 --> 10:30.035
Couldn't have done it without ya.

10:30.070 --> 10:31.820
What have I done to help?

10:31.872 --> 10:34.740
Oh, you... a million
things. Are you kidding me?

10:34.742 --> 10:38.160
You know, just being there,
and... and being you...

10:38.211 --> 10:39.578
(stammering)
there... and all...

10:39.629 --> 10:42.081
- Ma'am, are we ready?
- Er, yes.

10:42.083 --> 10:44.583
Would you place your left hand on
the Bible and raise your right hand?

10:44.585 --> 10:47.086
"I, Selina Catherine
Meyer, do solemnly swear..."

10:47.137 --> 10:50.422
I, Selina Catherine
Meyer, do solemnly swear...

10:50.473 --> 10:51.974
"...that I will faithfully execute..."

10:52.008 --> 10:54.510

10:54.561 --> 10:55.844
"...the office of President
of the United States..."

10:55.896 --> 10:58.898
the office of President
of the United States...

10:58.932 --> 11:00.316
<i>Chief Justice: "...and will

11:00.350 --> 11:01.934

11:16.783 --> 11:18.834
Congratulations, Madam President.

11:18.868 --> 11:20.953
Thank you very much, Mr. Chief Justice.

11:20.955 --> 11:23.122
- (applause, cheering)
- Thank you.

11:30.180 --> 11:31.797
Ma'am...?

11:31.848 --> 11:34.133
Dan! What the fuck is this?

11:34.135 --> 11:35.301
What are you talking about?

11:35.303 --> 11:37.469
You've got me buried so
far into the West Wing,

11:37.471 --> 11:39.221
I'm practically in Pyongyang.

11:39.272 --> 11:41.523
Jonah, you have a job in the White House,

11:41.558 --> 11:43.309
all right? That was the deal.

11:43.311 --> 11:45.644
I publically denounced the Internet, Dan.

11:45.646 --> 11:47.646
Okay? Those are my people!

11:47.648 --> 11:49.481
I'm getting so much online hate.

11:49.483 --> 11:51.483
There are memes of me being burned alive.

11:51.534 --> 11:53.736
- Ooh, wow.
- There's one of me fuckin' a chicken

11:53.787 --> 11:55.321
while dressed as bin Laden.

11:55.323 --> 11:57.406
The chicken is dressed as bin Laden
or you're dressed as bin Laden?

11:57.457 --> 11:58.958
<i>No, I'm dressed as bin Laden, Dan!</i>

11:58.992 --> 12:00.709
- (ching)
- And it's really well done.

12:00.744 --> 12:03.329
So it legitimately looks like
I am engaging in bestiality

12:03.331 --> 12:05.080
while insulting 9/11 victims.

12:05.131 --> 12:06.498
Oh, wow. That
is... that is tough.

12:06.549 --> 12:08.000
I want a new deal.

12:08.002 --> 12:09.835
I wanna get closer to the action.

12:09.837 --> 12:11.837
I'm like a boom op on
a porn shoot right now.

12:11.888 --> 12:13.922
I'm sorry, man. But, you know...

12:13.974 --> 12:17.059
I can't have a terrorist
chicken-fucker next to the president.

12:17.093 --> 12:19.311
Security risk.

12:19.346 --> 12:21.013
<i>- Gary: Hey, ma'am?
- Selina: Yes?</i>

12:21.015 --> 12:22.731
<i>Gary: Do you remember that
time in New York when you said</i>

12:22.766 --> 12:24.817
that if this day ever came,
you'd wear those special shoes?

12:24.851 --> 12:27.436
<i>- (cameras clicking)
- Well, I've had them ever since.</i>

12:27.487 --> 12:31.023

- Uh...

12:31.074 --> 12:33.025
(cameras clicking)

12:33.027 --> 12:35.661
- Oh, uh... of course. Yes.
- (Laughing)

12:35.695 --> 12:38.497
- Selina: That's so touching.
- Isn't that cool?

12:38.531 --> 12:41.784
Oh, you're like Prince
Charming. (chuckles)

12:41.835 --> 12:46.755
- (cameras clicking)
- Perfect shoe for the perfect moment

12:46.790 --> 12:50.426
in the perfect life of a perfect woman.

12:50.460 --> 12:52.177
This is like Kathy Bates in "Misery."

12:53.213 --> 12:54.546
Beautiful shoe
for a beautiful...

12:54.548 --> 12:56.181
- Okay, that's enough, though.
- Okay.

12:56.216 --> 12:58.217
- Take it in. Enjoy the speech.
- I will.

12:58.219 --> 13:00.302
You're gonna be great.

13:00.353 --> 13:03.522
This is so exciting. It's
like a wedding or something.

13:03.556 --> 13:05.691
Yeah, except there's
no bridesmaids to fuck.

13:06.559 --> 13:09.395
(squeaking)

13:12.232 --> 13:14.400
(squeaking)

13:16.703 --> 13:20.406

- It's like she's walking on a carpet of mice.

13:20.408 --> 13:23.075
<i>Dan: Jesus Christ, Gary.
Are those real shoes</i>

13:23.126 --> 13:24.660
or are those fucking dog toys?

13:24.711 --> 13:26.245
Sounds like the theme from "Psycho."

13:26.247 --> 13:29.548
<i>(squeaking slows, stops)</i>

13:30.583 --> 13:32.501
My fellow Americans.

13:32.552 --> 13:36.255

- Excuse me, excuse me.

13:36.257 --> 13:37.723
<i>I stand before you, and before God...</i>

13:37.757 --> 13:40.476
Ahem...

13:40.510 --> 13:42.895
(whining) Oh, my God,
you know better than that.

13:42.929 --> 13:45.731
You know better than that. (sobbing)

13:49.569 --> 13:51.437
Ahem.

13:52.939 --> 13:56.408
You have not elected me as
your president by your votes,

13:56.443 --> 13:58.410
<i>- but I ask that you accept me...
- (Sighs)</i>

13:58.445 --> 14:00.446
<i>- Are you seeing this on Twitter?
- ...as your president...</i>

14:00.448 --> 14:02.698
<i>- Yup. "President squeaks to the nation."
- ...in your hearts.</i>

14:02.749 --> 14:06.335

14:31.144 --> 14:32.978
- Take these fucking shoes...
- Yup.

14:32.980 --> 14:35.731
- ...and shoot 'em in the fucking head.
- Yeah, I'm so sorry.

14:35.782 --> 14:39.318
Okay? Now... I am the most
powerful person in the world.

14:39.369 --> 14:40.986
<i>- Is that correct?
- Yes, ma'am.</i>

14:41.037 --> 14:44.072
Any fuckup from now on
is not just a fuckup.

14:44.124 --> 14:45.991
It's my legacy.

14:46.042 --> 14:48.994
Got it? No fuckups.

14:49.078 --> 14:52.631
Ma'am? Uh, taking Leslie
Kerr away from State

14:52.665 --> 14:55.334
has freaked the Iranians
out. They trust him.

14:55.385 --> 14:58.337
No, wait a minute. Hold on. I didn't...
I didn't let anyone go from State.

14:58.421 --> 15:00.422
Madam President. You asked me to swap out

15:00.473 --> 15:01.807
Leslie Kerr.

15:01.841 --> 15:04.343
<i>No! Leslie Carr!</i>

C-A-R-R.

That bitch from Energy.
Remember I made that joke

15:09.016 --> 15:10.933
about she didn't have energy?

15:11.017 --> 15:14.319
<i>Yeah, but her name is Leanne Carr, ma'am.</i>

15:15.188 --> 15:16.772
Oh, fuck, it is.

15:16.823 --> 15:18.824
Oh, my God. Oh, shit!

15:18.858 --> 15:20.609
Oh, my God. What have you done to me, Kent?

15:20.660 --> 15:23.445
- I'm sorry?
- You should have questioned the name.

15:23.496 --> 15:26.532
I... should have. Yes. I
apologize, Madam President.

15:26.583 --> 15:28.917
Can... can we say that
it was just an error?

15:28.952 --> 15:31.036
No, ma'am. The entire
world would notice that.

15:31.087 --> 15:34.206
Yeah, it's terrible PR. You might
as well drive a suicide clown car

15:34.257 --> 15:35.674
into the fucking Lincoln Memorial.

15:35.708 --> 15:37.426
Yes, I am still here.

15:37.460 --> 15:39.294
Oh, my God. Is this gonna
hurt us in the polls?

15:39.345 --> 15:41.180
I can't see how it won't.

15:41.214 --> 15:42.881
What does that mean? Is that a yes?

15:42.932 --> 15:45.300
If you mean to say yes, then say
yes. You're the fucking yes-man.

15:45.351 --> 15:48.720
- Yes.
- Okay, here's what you're gonna do.

you attach some electrodes

15:57.397 --> 16:01.733
Okay, whatever the fuck. What man
is named "Leslie," for fuck's sakes?

16:01.784 --> 16:04.820
Leslie Nielsen. Leslie Moonves.

16:04.871 --> 16:07.039
- Leslie Frazier, the coach for the Vikings... 
- Huh?

16:07.073 --> 16:09.208
Doesn't matter.
You're... good speech.

16:09.242 --> 16:10.959
Ma'am? Secretary Maddox

16:10.994 --> 16:14.580

- No. Stat.

He could bring in the senior citizens.

17:43.337 --> 17:45.470
They only got one vote
left in 'em, we need it.

17:45.505 --> 17:47.673
Do we really wanna push
the Jonah's-uncle alarm?

17:47.675 --> 17:49.474
We have to. We just need bodies now, Amy.

17:49.509 --> 17:53.011
Warm, upright bodies that can
still punch a hole in a card.

17:53.062 --> 17:56.014
Kent, your rhetoric,
as always, is inspiring.

17:56.065 --> 17:57.516
I am calling Dan.

17:57.567 --> 17:59.651
<i>Dan: Okay, Amy, yes. I'll find him.</i>

17:59.686 --> 18:02.854
<i>I mean, how hard can it be?</i>

18:03.823 --> 18:05.824
Hey, Jonah.

18:05.858 --> 18:08.694
You know, buddy, I have
been mean and I'm sorry.

18:08.696 --> 18:10.278
What kind of idiot do you think I am?

18:10.330 --> 18:13.031
- Is there a choice?
- I only have one asset

18:13.082 --> 18:14.366
that you would be interested in

18:14.368 --> 18:16.034
and that's my Uncle Jeff's bucket of votes.

18:16.036 --> 18:17.953
Great! So you'll get us Uncle Jeff?

18:18.004 --> 18:20.706
Oh... no, I'm just gettin' started.

18:20.757 --> 18:22.924
I want West Exec parking for the Cube,

18:22.959 --> 18:24.209
and I want mess hall privileges.

18:24.260 --> 18:26.044
No. That's...
that's impossible.

18:26.095 --> 18:28.380
Well, then you better
"possible-ize" it, Dan.

18:28.431 --> 18:30.349
And I want somebody that works for me.

18:30.383 --> 18:33.218
I want an assistant, a gopher, a servant.

18:33.269 --> 18:35.020
- Oh, you want a Jonah?
- Yeah! I want a Jonah.

18:35.054 --> 18:37.055
- Mmhmm.
- And henceforth they will no longer

18:37.057 --> 18:39.558
be known as "Jonahs."
They'll be known as...

18:39.609 --> 18:41.977
Jimmys or Pepes or Sarahs
or whatever the fuck

18:42.028 --> 18:44.029
that person's name turns out to be.

18:44.063 --> 18:46.314
And you can't hire anyone named Jonah.

18:46.366 --> 18:48.567
Okay? See, I'm on to you already.

18:48.618 --> 18:50.869
Shit! I gotta go.

18:50.903 --> 18:52.788
You know what? They
should be called "Dans."

18:52.822 --> 18:55.207
Well, that was an awkward Cabinet meeting.

18:55.241 --> 18:57.459
Leanne Carr knows I
definitely tried to fire her.

18:57.493 --> 18:59.044
She found some fucking energy now.

18:59.078 --> 19:00.579
<i>How we doing with the office move, Sue?</i>

19:00.630 --> 19:02.497
- Two more days, ma'am.
- Oh, okay.

19:02.548 --> 19:04.049
Uh, ma'am? More shit just in.

19:04.083 --> 19:06.668
- What?
- Maddox and Pierce just publicly endorsed Chung.

19:06.719 --> 19:08.253
This means you could come in third.

19:08.304 --> 19:10.756
- Ma'am, shit just in...
- God damn it, I know.

19:10.807 --> 19:12.591
I can't be president and come in third.

19:12.593 --> 19:14.893
- We're gonna have to go to New Hampshire now.
- Excellent idea.

19:14.927 --> 19:17.145
- I'll pack you up.
- Maybe pack a squeaky coat.

19:17.180 --> 19:20.515
All right, call Amy right now and tell
her I need a photo op or something.

19:20.566 --> 19:23.268
We need, like, a hospital
or a school or a factory.

19:23.319 --> 19:25.103
- Okay.
- Okay? Just not a hospice.

19:25.154 --> 19:27.773
I can't risk some fucker
flatlining right next to me.

19:27.775 --> 19:30.108
<i>(sirens wailing)</i>

19:31.444 --> 19:33.111
<i>Dan: Maybe Chung didn't torture that guy,</i>

19:33.162 --> 19:35.447
<i>but he sure is waterboarding
the fuck out of us in the polls.</i>

19:35.498 --> 19:37.699
<i>Selina: Jesus. If I come
in third, this could be</i>

19:37.750 --> 19:39.618
<i>the shortest administration in history.</i>

19:39.620 --> 19:42.587
<i>Mike: Yeah, like a Snapchat presidency.</i>

19:42.622 --> 19:44.456
<i>No, that won't happen.</i>

19:44.458 --> 19:46.124
<i>Isn't this plane amazing?</i>

19:46.175 --> 19:48.427
<i>Ben: Yeah, can we fly
it into Danny Chung?</i>

19:52.682 --> 19:55.767
Selina: Okay, so what does
Jonah's uncle want exactly?

19:55.802 --> 19:58.303
Long term? Medicaid task force
and Social Security reform.

19:58.354 --> 20:00.439
But for now we can give
him a private 10 minutes,

20:00.473 --> 20:02.057
and, of course, a picture
with the president.

20:02.108 --> 20:03.475
Oh, will he agree to that?

20:03.477 --> 20:07.145
- You're the president, ma'am.
- Oh, my God. Right.

20:07.196 --> 20:09.614
All right, so as long
as he can guarantee us

20:09.649 --> 20:10.982
the blue hair ballots, right?

20:10.984 --> 20:12.984
No, ma'am, he's an AARP
lobbyist, all right?

20:12.986 --> 20:14.319
He's got old people coming out of his ass.

20:14.370 --> 20:16.404
Haiku version, Jeff Kane
will buy us some bodies.

20:16.456 --> 20:17.956
I want that polling place to look like

20:17.990 --> 20:20.208
an assisted living facility, okay?

20:20.243 --> 20:21.576
So we'll do the photo op.

20:21.627 --> 20:24.212
Gary? Hey, where is this photo op, Ame?

20:24.247 --> 20:26.381
It's at a factory that makes
protective gear for firefighters.

20:26.415 --> 20:28.834
I think that's great, ma'am.
Everybody loves firefighters.

20:28.836 --> 20:30.051
Everybody wants to keep them safe.

20:30.086 --> 20:31.586
Yeah, everybody wants to fuck 'em, too.

20:31.637 --> 20:33.638
God, I would love to fuck a firefighter.

20:33.673 --> 20:36.141
Hey, I'm the president. I can
fuck anybody I want now, right?

20:36.175 --> 20:37.642
All the other ones have.

20:38.978 --> 20:40.929
I hope I can count on
your vote. Can I? Yeah!

20:40.980 --> 20:42.180
(cheering, applause)

20:42.231 --> 20:44.149
I can tell you're gonna vote for me.

20:44.183 --> 20:46.735
And you got a good beanie on, too.

20:46.769 --> 20:48.153
Now tell me what this is all about.

20:48.187 --> 20:50.856
Now obviously the most
important aspect of the suit

20:50.858 --> 20:54.025
- is the fact that it's...
- Fireproof? Is that right?

20:54.027 --> 20:55.744
- (all laughing)
- I got an "A," good.

20:55.778 --> 20:58.997
She is so good at making people
believe she is good with people.

20:59.031 --> 21:01.416
<i>- Yeah, she's doing great. She's on fire.
- (Faint chiming)</i>

21:01.450 --> 21:03.752
A great advantage that she
has over the other candidates

21:03.786 --> 21:06.204
in this race is that she's the president.

21:08.040 --> 21:09.374
<i>- She's not the president.
- Selina: obviously gotta be fireproof.</i>

21:09.376 --> 21:11.126
Can't be made of tissue paper.

21:11.177 --> 21:12.711
- Can't be made of cashmere...
- My apologies, ma'am.

21:12.713 --> 21:13.879
- Which... 
- My apologies...

21:13.881 --> 21:15.263
- Yes?
- This is very urgent.

21:15.298 --> 21:17.432
Oh, would you excuse
me? I'll be right back.

21:17.466 --> 21:18.717
Just a second.

21:18.768 --> 21:21.436
- What?
- We've gotta go back to DC.

21:21.470 --> 21:23.555
- Why?
- You got the oath wrong, ma'am.

21:23.606 --> 21:25.557
You didn't say "preserve."

21:25.608 --> 21:27.359
- Yes, I did.
- No, not really.

21:27.393 --> 21:30.529
You said "pre" and then
Mike fell into the lamp.

21:30.563 --> 21:33.615
The Speaker insists that you take it again

21:33.649 --> 21:36.284
and that the oath isn't legal
and that you're not the president.

21:36.319 --> 21:37.619
<i>(hisses) I am the president!</i>

21:37.653 --> 21:39.070
I know, I know.

21:39.072 --> 21:40.822
I'm not going back to DC.
I'm staying in New Hampshire.

21:40.873 --> 21:43.158
<i>Get the Chief Justice
to come here and do it.</i>

21:43.209 --> 21:45.794
No! I got a better idea.
Get a local judge to do it.

21:45.828 --> 21:48.614
Wait, wait, wait. Isn't that
gonna look just a little bit tacky?

21:51.436 --> 21:52.636
- I don't think about it. 
- No, no, no.

21:52.638 --> 21:54.438
That could be really great for us.

21:54.472 --> 21:57.641
Play up to New Hampshire's already
inflated sense of self-importance.

21:57.643 --> 21:59.059
Exactly. I got it. I'm on it, yeah.

21:59.110 --> 22:00.811
And get Catherine, okay?
'Cause I gotta... you know...

22:00.862 --> 22:02.613
- have her hold the thing.
- All: The Bible.

22:02.647 --> 22:04.064
The Bible... yeah.

22:04.115 --> 22:05.866
Okay, God
damn... ahem.

22:05.901 --> 22:08.118
Hi, sorry about that. (chuckles)

22:08.153 --> 22:10.621
That's all right. Let's move on
to the detachable inner portion

22:10.655 --> 22:12.990
- of the suit, which is water-resistant... 
- Okay.

22:12.992 --> 22:14.708
Oh, because you're holding a fire hose.

22:14.743 --> 22:16.210
<i>- Yes, I get it.
- Ben: Madam President.</i>

22:16.244 --> 22:17.578
- Yes?
- I'm so sorry to interrupt again.

22:17.629 --> 22:20.164
- Sorry.
- I'm so sorry.

22:20.166 --> 22:22.833
Gotta put out another
fire over here, I guess.

22:22.835 --> 22:24.635
(laughing)

22:24.669 --> 22:27.504
Shit. What is it?

22:27.506 --> 22:31.725
Iran is officially pissed
that you fired Leslie Kerr.

22:31.760 --> 22:33.477
Apparently they liked the
guy. It must be the beard.

22:33.511 --> 22:35.012
What does "officially pissed" mean?

22:35.063 --> 22:36.313
Well, they made an official statement

22:36.348 --> 22:37.898
that could spook the markets.

22:37.933 --> 22:40.100
You know, spike gas prices.

22:40.151 --> 22:42.353
You've gotta reinstate Leslie Kerr, period.

22:42.404 --> 22:43.904
No, we agreed that would be a PR disaster.

22:43.939 --> 22:45.856
So you'd rather piss off
blue-collar truck drivers

22:45.907 --> 22:47.858
- and their chicken-frying wives? 
- Shh.

22:47.909 --> 22:49.777
We're surrounded by these people.

22:49.828 --> 22:51.495
Keep your voice down.

22:51.529 --> 22:54.081
Get him on the phone.

22:55.667 --> 22:58.535
Hi. Now I am all yours.

22:58.537 --> 23:01.338
Ma'am, I'm so sorry. I'm
so sorry to interrupt.

23:01.373 --> 23:03.340
- Yes?
- Diane Appleby, a local federal judge,

23:03.375 --> 23:06.594
- is gonna be here in 15 minutes. 
- Okay, um...

23:06.628 --> 23:09.213
Sir, do you have a private room
that we could use very briefly

23:09.264 --> 23:10.631
for some official White House business?

23:10.682 --> 23:13.267
- Well, I don't know. I... 
- Perhaps your office?

23:13.301 --> 23:15.469
Madam President? Leslie Kerr.

23:15.520 --> 23:17.471
Excuse me. Leslie...?

23:17.522 --> 23:20.274
My office is being treated for black mold.

23:20.358 --> 23:22.643
You'd all have to wear protective masks.

23:22.694 --> 23:25.613
- Would that be a problem?
- Yeah, it would.

23:26.781 --> 23:28.782
<i>Selina: Mr. Kane.</i>

23:28.817 --> 23:31.952
I just want you to know that the
AARP is very close to my heart.

23:31.987 --> 23:33.570
That's good to hear.

23:33.572 --> 23:36.240
I am so pleased that we
can count on your support.

23:36.242 --> 23:38.709
- Happy to help, ma'am.
- And you know what I want to do?

23:38.743 --> 23:40.411
I want to do a photo with you

23:40.413 --> 23:42.830
after I'm done with this
swearing-in business.

23:42.881 --> 23:46.383
And could young Jonah
also be in the photograph?

23:46.418 --> 23:48.585
- Sure.
- Ma'am, can I say

23:48.637 --> 23:50.721
that I am just honored
to be a part of your team?

23:50.755 --> 23:52.256
And that I will serve you faithfully

23:52.307 --> 23:54.141
as long as you happen to be president.

23:54.175 --> 23:56.753
- That's lovely.
- Ma'am, the room's clear.

23:58.353 --> 24:00.754
- And Catherine's here? 
- I don't know. I think she must be stuck in traffic.

24:00.758 --> 24:02.959
Well, I need her. She's
gotta hold the Bible.

24:02.961 --> 24:04.961
(stammers) Oh,
I... I can do that.

24:05.012 --> 24:07.096
- No.
- No?

24:07.131 --> 24:09.883
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- Oh, my baby is here.

24:09.934 --> 24:11.467
My baby.

24:11.518 --> 24:12.852
(chuckling) Gonna take this girl

24:12.887 --> 24:14.971
and get this oath all sworn up. Come on.

24:15.022 --> 24:16.472
I can't thank you enough for coming

24:16.523 --> 24:19.108
<i>- this last minute.
- Judge: I was happy to oblige.</i>

24:19.143 --> 24:20.393
Thank you very much.

24:20.444 --> 24:22.145
- Sorry to interrupt. Your Honor.
- Yes.

24:22.196 --> 24:24.530
I'm just going to make
the shot a little better.

24:24.565 --> 24:25.982
- Okay.
- So...

24:26.033 --> 24:27.817
maybe here is good.

24:27.819 --> 24:30.153
Okay...
oh. Uh-huh.

24:30.204 --> 24:32.121
I, Selina Catherine Meyer...

24:32.156 --> 24:34.624
This is an historic moment.

24:34.658 --> 24:37.410
I mean, I like this one
better than the first one.

24:39.413 --> 24:40.997
Selina: the Constitution
of the United States...

24:41.048 --> 24:43.383
It's good, you know? She's
the people's president.

24:43.417 --> 24:45.134
This looks ordinary, it looks relatable.

24:45.169 --> 24:48.054
It looks horrible. She looks
like she's in "Flashdance."

24:48.088 --> 24:50.673
They're gonna have a field
day with that haircut.

24:50.675 --> 24:53.009
"Thai lady-boy made head of sweatshop."

24:53.011 --> 24:56.229
<i>Male reporter: Second time lucky
for Selina as President Meyer...</i>

24:56.263 --> 24:58.982
<i>Female reporter: Things are not
looking good for Selina Meyer</i>

24:59.016 --> 25:01.100
<i>as New Hampshire makes its voice heard...</i>

25:01.151 --> 25:02.936
<i>Female reporter ♪2: with victory
now confirmed for Governor Danny Chung,</i>

25:02.987 --> 25:04.854
<i>it's a race for second place
here in New Hampshire...</i>

25:04.905 --> 25:08.241
I think that there were fundamental
issues with the New Hampshire campaign

25:08.275 --> 25:10.693
and I just wish I'd have been
here earlier to advise you.

25:10.744 --> 25:13.079
<i>Mike: Campaigns are a lot more difficult</i>

25:13.113 --> 25:15.198
than experimental dance troupes, Catherine.

25:15.249 --> 25:17.033
(sighs)

25:17.035 --> 25:19.953
It's good we won Dixville Notch.

25:20.004 --> 25:22.038
It's got a population of 12, Mike.

25:22.040 --> 25:24.207
I know, Dan, but it's famous.

25:24.209 --> 25:26.042
Our Lord Jesus started with 12.

25:26.044 --> 25:27.877
He didn't win New Hampshire, either.

25:31.181 --> 25:33.016
Look, Bedford hasn't come
in yet. That's a big one.

25:33.050 --> 25:35.101
We take Bedford, we got a shot.

25:35.185 --> 25:37.553
- We lost Bedford.
- Shit. Just now?

25:37.555 --> 25:39.138
No, while you were sleeping, Mike.

25:39.189 --> 25:40.556
I wasn't sleeping.

25:40.607 --> 25:42.058
- What about Durham?
- The numbers are the same

25:42.060 --> 25:44.944
as the last time you
asked me two minutes ago.

25:46.480 --> 25:48.147
What's going on? What are we
hearing? Is there any news?

25:48.198 --> 25:50.149
Chung won. Right now
we're just waiting to see...

25:50.200 --> 25:51.901
Oh, wait. Greg at CNN is calling it.

25:51.903 --> 25:54.570
- Oh. Did I come in second?
