15:05.920 --> 15:07.520
But your fates are now entwined.

15:08.800 --> 15:11.120
We must work together
to protect you and the Fey.

15:11.200 --> 15:13.400
And when were you ever a friend
of the Fey?

15:14.080 --> 15:15.280
[Merlin] For 700 years,

15:15.360 --> 15:18.000
I've stood in the breach
between men and the Fey,

15:18.080 --> 15:19.600
giving all my blood and toil

15:19.680 --> 15:22.440
to keep them from tearing out
each other's throats.

15:22.520 --> 15:25.200
-I have failed more than I have won.
-What do you want?

15:26.600 --> 15:29.280
I have bargained for your life
with Cumber the Ice King.

15:31.880 --> 15:33.480
I did not ask you to do this.

15:34.040 --> 15:36.320
I presented him with a priceless gift

15:37.320 --> 15:39.760
that weakens Uther's claim
to the throne and...

15:40.320 --> 15:41.320
strengthens his own.

15:43.480 --> 15:46.920
In return, you are invited to his court
as his prisoner.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.920
And you're expected
to present him with the sword.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.200
But your life will be spared.

15:50.280 --> 15:53.480
-[Morgana] Hardly the offer of a friend.
-No, it's the offer of a rival!

15:54.440 --> 15:57.000
For that is all that surrounds her now.
Enemies and rivals.

15:57.080 --> 15:59.880
[Morgana] Then we shall fight and prove
to them who the rightful heir is.

15:59.960 --> 16:01.840
To fight is to die.

16:04.680 --> 16:05.920
What of the Fey?

16:07.680 --> 16:10.240
If I'm to accept this offer,
what happens to them?

16:14.520 --> 16:16.640
Journey with me to the Beggar's Coast

16:17.320 --> 16:19.040
and take an audience with Cumber.

16:20.600 --> 16:23.080
The raiders are closer to the Fey
than the Church.

16:23.520 --> 16:26.400
Together we can plead their case
and attempt to turn his mind.

16:31.880 --> 16:33.160
You know my thoughts.

16:36.480 --> 16:37.400
Arthur?

16:42.040 --> 16:43.840
If you give this Ice King the sword,

16:44.200 --> 16:46.400
you become his bargaining chip.

16:47.120 --> 16:49.920
He's an invader and will seek alliances
against Uther Pendragon.

16:50.280 --> 16:51.920
And you become his leverage.

16:56.480 --> 16:58.400
It appears my advisers agree.

16:58.760 --> 16:59.760
For once.

I'm sorry.

17:12.320 --> 17:15.720
We have friends who are still missing.
We must resume our search efforts.

-[Arthur] What?

18:01.400 --> 18:03.280
-Were you spying on me?
-Are you mad?

18:04.120 --> 18:05.560
What do you want, Arthur?

18:07.520 --> 18:08.880
I want us to talk for once.

18:09.760 --> 18:11.920
We're blood.
And we're the only family we've got.

18:12.000 --> 18:15.080
So if you have something to say to me...
here I am.

18:19.800 --> 18:21.000
Seeing Uncle...

18:22.120 --> 18:23.120

18:27.800 --> 18:29.320
And that you went to him.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.120
To beg his blessing.

18:32.240 --> 18:34.480
Even after everything he did to us.

18:35.040 --> 18:36.400
Arthur, you brought him the sword,

18:36.480 --> 18:38.080
-of all things.
-That's not what happened.

18:38.160 --> 18:39.800
-There was a tournament.
-Oh, a tournament!

-Oh well!
-Yes, a tournament.

and I never stopped him.

18:53.520 --> 18:54.640
But wh... what was I?

18:55.920 --> 18:58.000
I was 12 years old. With debts.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.040
Debts that...

19:00.120 --> 19:03.200
They weigh onto me like bloody chains
to this very day.

19:03.680 --> 19:05.080
It's 'cause of our father.

some daddy's boy from his horse

19:18.960 --> 19:21.680
can give me a shred of honor,
then so be it.

You're better than him, brother.

19:23.600 --> 19:25.360
That's not what this castle says.

Is that how you judge a man's worth?

-By land.

You are not common.

Yes. But you have been removed

I won't allow her
to give up that sword, Arthur.

The way it looks, she won't have a choice.

20:21.920 --> 20:23.200
There's always a choice.

20:23.280 --> 20:25.200
You'd rather see her dead than give it up?

20:25.280 --> 20:28.400
I'd rather see her die
with the sword in her hand, fighting.

Should the Fey Queen
surrender herself peacefully,

King Uther is willing to show lenience

29:06.480 --> 29:09.560
by allowing you to live out
your natural years in his dungeons,

29:09.640 --> 29:12.120
provided you relinquish to his possession

29:12.680 --> 29:13.840
the Sword of Power.

29:16.640 --> 29:17.760
And what of the Fey?

29:18.800 --> 29:19.880
What happens to them?

29:20.880 --> 29:22.720
If they abandon this city
and their weapons,

29:22.800 --> 29:24.520
then they may return to their homes.

29:24.600 --> 29:27.480
What homes?
Father Carden burned them all.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.760
Well, then they can go somewhere else.

29:30.360 --> 29:33.040
To the roads?
To be slaughtered by the Red Paladins?

-Oh no. I am.

[rousing music plays]

29:40.080 --> 29:43.120
A Viking king made a very appealing offer
to acquire my sword

29:43.200 --> 29:46.040
in return
for some very favorable protections.

29:47.760 --> 29:49.720
This is all I am prepared to offer.

29:54.920 --> 29:57.080
This is the Sword of the First Kings.

worthy of it, let him prove it.

Were King Uther to guarantee protection
for your kind,

you would, in return,
surrender yourself and the sword?

you could have told them.
But you didn't. Why?

The difference is,
your life may be spared.

I'll work hard.
I'll take food for payment.

I can check for you though.

45:25.840 --> 45:28.480
We understand
there was communication with the witch.

45:30.040 --> 45:32.600
We had hoped, in fact, agreed,

45:33.240 --> 45:38.040
that any negotiation
would be coordinated by the Church.

Coordinated?

45:40.880 --> 45:46.000
Is this the same way you coordinated
your attacks on the Fey villages with us?

45:46.080 --> 45:48.360
[Carden] With all due respect,
Your Majesty,

45:48.440 --> 45:50.160
the cleansing of the Fey is...

45:51.000 --> 45:52.280
an act of charity,

45:52.640 --> 45:53.760
the act of a friend,

45:54.440 --> 45:56.280
missions for which we seek no reward.

45:56.360 --> 45:58.400
And you have stolen our lands,

45:58.880 --> 46:00.600
terrorized our people,

46:00.680 --> 46:02.880
turned many of them against the Crown

46:02.960 --> 46:05.160
and into the arms of a Fey peasant girl.

46:05.240 --> 46:08.320
And you have the audacity

46:08.400 --> 46:10.840
to call this the act of a friend?

46:10.920 --> 46:14.000
Father Carden is no politician,
Your Majesty,

46:14.400 --> 46:15.640
but a soldier of God.

46:16.480 --> 46:18.280
No offense was intended.

46:19.520 --> 46:22.480
His Majesty desires the Sword of Power,
of course.

46:23.760 --> 46:26.120
The Church, too, desires the sword.

46:26.840 --> 46:29.560
Acquiring such an important Fey relic

46:29.640 --> 46:32.520
would strike them a spiritual death blow,
so to speak.

46:33.160 --> 46:34.000
But...

46:34.880 --> 46:36.200
as friends,

46:36.920 --> 46:39.520
we understand His Majesty's needs,

46:39.600 --> 46:42.520

Therefore, I propose a swap.

No.

47:01.960 --> 47:02.800
No?

47:02.880 --> 47:05.000
The Fey girl has aroused the passions
of the mob.

47:05.080 --> 47:07.920
Burning her now
would only arouse them further.

47:08.000 --> 47:12.200
We shall keep her as our prize
until those passions subside.

47:13.600 --> 47:18.040
Only then will we consider whether or not
to hand her over to the Church.

Let them fall off the face of the Earth

47:27.760 --> 47:30.880
This will be seen as a victory for the Fey
over the Church!

Well, if the Church takes exception,

to answer your grievance.

47:40.680 --> 47:42.480
This is an outrage!
