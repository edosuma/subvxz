Hey. I'm good, I'm good. How are you'?

03:05.085 --> 03:06.337
I'm okay.

03:06.420 --> 03:08.718
So, when are you coming home?

03:09.715 --> 03:13.686
I had in mind to maybe train
for an hour, or something.

03:13.802 --> 03:14.974
I can skip it, too, baby.

03:15.053 --> 03:18.774
No, if you really need to be Karate
Kid tonight, you can, you know...

03:19.224 --> 03:23.320
If you wanna lay... I don't know.
Separate a few bricks, I don't know.

03:24.521 --> 03:27.695
No, I can skip it. But actually
my brother called me.

03:27.899 --> 03:29.116
Oh really, he did?

03:29.192 --> 03:33.322
Yeah, yeah. He wants to do a
try-out session. Yes. Nice!

03:33.488 --> 03:36.742
He wants to train with me. He
want's to train martial arts now.

03:37.242 --> 03:40.041
Good, I'm glad. That
sounds really, really good.

03:40.537 --> 03:44.667
Well, don't stay out to long,
cause I have some exciting news.

03:45.626 --> 03:46.843
What'? What is it?

03:48.211 --> 03:50.509
I'll tell you, when I see you.

03:50.589 --> 03:52.216
Oh, come on.

03:52.966 --> 03:53.808
What is it'?

03:53.925 --> 03:57.771

08:00.463 --> 08:05.185
Yeah, was good. Was good. I think
Alex is gonna be the next Bruce Lee.

08:07.345 --> 08:11.691
Baby, with your training I'm totally
positive he'll be good. He'll be great.

08:11.766 --> 08:12.766
Yeah!

08:13.143 --> 08:16.568
No, it was good, it was great.
I was happy, that he was...

08:16.646 --> 08:19.208
Maybe the fighting can be something,
you and your brother bond over.

08:19.232 --> 08:20.232
You think?

08:20.275 --> 08:23.495
Definitely, definitely. So you're

09:23.129 --> 09:23.755
What happened?

09:23.838 --> 09:27.513
They stabbed me, man,

10:22.981 --> 10:25.154
Baby, I come home now.

10:25.233 --> 10:27.827
Don't worry. It's okay. I brought
him near Alexander Plalz.

10:27.902 --> 10:29.745
I'm so relieved. Good. Okay, Joe'?

10:29.821 --> 10:32.119

10:35.243 --> 10:37.086

10:37.412 --> 10:40.256

You see this'? You're almost

10:42.751 --> 10:45.004
You almost did it, okay?
It's just a few meters!

10:45.086 --> 10:47.088
- Joe, please. Joe, listen.
- Okay, okay.

10:47.172 --> 10:48.515
Do not get involved.

10:48.631 --> 10:49.382
You see?

10:49.466 --> 10:51.719
- Just go, around that house.
- Do not gel involved!

10:51.843 --> 10:53.095
You stand?

10:53.887 --> 10:55.013

10:55.263 --> 10:56.640
Okay baby, I'm coming.

11:02.228 --> 11:02.979
Joe?

11:03.063 --> 11:03.689
<i>Okay-</i>

11:03.772 --> 11:06.335
You need to leave him.
You have to leave him now.

11:06.360 --> 11:07.360
I'm sorry.

11:09.194 --> 11:11.117
Okay baby, I'm coming.

Just gel into the car.

11:17.619 --> 11:18.619
Joe?

11:19.954 --> 11:20.954
Joe?

11:23.541 --> 11:24.667
Slop the car.

11:29.297 --> 11:30.594
Hello Mister Suit.

11:33.885 --> 11:35.387
Please let him go, please.

11:35.470 --> 11:36.470
Please let him go.

11:37.722 --> 11:38.769
Who are you'?

11:38.848 --> 11:41.772
- They dress up casual and than they gel the credits.
- He's done, okay?

11:41.893 --> 11:43.145
He's working in a bank.

11:44.354 --> 11:45.697
Yes, Mister Volksbank.

11:45.772 --> 11:47.399
Mister Volksbank.

11:47.482 --> 11:48.108
Hello.

11:48.191 --> 11:50.836
- He's dying. It's okay. You got him. You got him already, okay?
- Do we look, like we care?

11:50.860 --> 11:51.702
Bu! he's not a Hunter.

11:51.820 --> 11:53.788
Do you have muscles? Can you show me'?

11:56.074 --> 11:57.074
How much?

11:57.242 --> 11:58.835
- Hundred Euro.
- I want your phone.

11:58.910 --> 12:00.833
We found him first, right?

12:00.912 --> 12:02.289
We want our price.

12:02.372 --> 12:04.420
Come on, try it again in
English. You can do it.

12:04.499 --> 12:07.127
- Not ten, thousand!
- We believe in you, Mister Volksbank.

12:13.258 --> 12:15.977
He's no Hunter. Just a civilian.

12:20.598 --> 12:22.771
So boring, come on let's do something.

12:24.102 --> 12:25.228
Hey, hey!

12:26.896 --> 12:28.739
What's up, old spank?

12:29.482 --> 12:31.610
- "Chick-a-boom“, I like this game.
- Haut ab.

12:31.693 --> 12:32.819
Oh man!

12:41.327 --> 12:43.671
Come on. come on. Okay guys, I got this.

13:00.763 --> 13:02.310
Pinky, my man. Come on.

13:02.599 --> 13:04.317
Yeah, come on, leach him how to play.

13:06.769 --> 13:07.520
Here we go.

13:07.687 --> 13:09.189
Here we go, come on.

13:16.112 --> 13:17.739
Oh, Jack, bam, ham, ham.

13:18.531 --> 13:19.531
Get lost already!

13:22.785 --> 13:24.207
Let's go, let's go.

13:25.872 --> 13:27.169
Let's go.

14:25.431 --> 14:26.728
Fucking wanker.

14:34.649 --> 14:37.372
Eight-forty-nine in sector eight.
Confirm elimination.

14:37.397 --> 14:38.303
Stop it!

14:38.361 --> 14:39.838
- Bring him in for assessment.
- Stop it!

14:39.862 --> 14:41.614
Fuck, man. Oh shit!

14:43.408 --> 14:44.408
You know the rules.

14:44.826 --> 14:45.827
Fucker!

15:14.522 --> 15:15.569
I'll kill you, ah'?

15:32.290 --> 15:34.384
Dispatch to Transport twenty-four.

15:34.834 --> 15:36.381
Transport twenty-four here.

15:36.669 --> 15:38.296
Pick up body in sector B.

15:38.379 --> 15:41.428
Runner Number seven, four,
seven. Confirmed elimination.

15:42.175 --> 15:45.349
We're way down in C.
Isn't there someone else?

16:18.336 --> 16:20.759
Mobile phone. Keys.

16:21.381 --> 16:22.633
Mobile phone.

16:27.595 --> 16:28.642
Jacket.

16:35.978 --> 16:36.978
Sit down.

17:51.220 --> 17:54.520
No, the phone is turned off. No, you
can't call him, because I can't...

17:54.640 --> 17:56.438
The phone is just simply
fucking turned off.

17:56.517 --> 17:57.143
Damn it.

17:57.226 --> 18:01.823
And I just watched the fucking
game on TV and I don't know...

18:02.106 --> 18:05.610
Please Alex, there has to be a
way. There has lo be another way.

18:05.693 --> 18:08.525
Come on, he's a German citizen,
he's just a good person.

18:08.550 --> 18:10.188
He just wanted to help someone.

18:11.449 --> 18:12.621
I don't understand.

18:12.700 --> 18:16.250
I don't know if what they're
showing is what's happening right now

18:16.329 --> 18:19.128
this second or if this happened
an hour ago. I don't know.

18:19.457 --> 18:25.009
About his path of redemption. Will he
go to prison, or will he join the Game?

18:25.505 --> 18:29.100
In cases like this, our
statistic shows, that...

19:52.216 --> 19:55.015
It's our rules. Listen up!

19:56.053 --> 20:01.105
You and the other runners will be abandoned in
a place about thirty kilometres from Berlin.

20:01.225 --> 20:05.025
From there you will have to make your way
lo the television tower to Alexander Platz.

20:05.187 --> 20:07.235
If you accomplish your
mission alive you will be

20:07.356 --> 20:11.827
set free and receive an unlimited
residence permit in Germany, unless...

20:12.278 --> 20:15.578
like yourself, you already
are an German citizen.

20:15.781 --> 20:18.125
Every German citizen may attack you...

20:19.452 --> 20:20.624
Sorry...

20:27.251 --> 20:31.552
Alright, every German citizen may attack
you. The attacker may also be attacked...

20:31.631 --> 20:36.603
This only applies, when they have actually
carried out attacks with the desire to kill.

20:36.677 --> 20:39.806
German citizens, who do not meddle
into play, may no! be attacked...

20:39.889 --> 20:41.729
you may accept the
help of German citizens,

20:41.766 --> 20:44.986
but these citizens may then in turn be also
attacked by the Hunters.

20:45.144 --> 20:48.023
Timeout to achieve the
goal is twenty-four hours.

20:48.105 --> 20:50.334
Continuously transmitted via
drones and hidden cameras,

20:50.358 --> 20:52.201
it's recommended not to
stay in one place...

20:52.276 --> 20:54.654
Do not break any laws or steal things.

20:54.862 --> 20:57.456
And it's recommended not to use public
transportation because

20:57.531 --> 21:00.910
there are just too many
passengers that could betray or attack you,

21:00.993 --> 21:03.667
and there wouldn't be any
way to escape anyhow.

21:09.460 --> 21:11.758
All right. Let's start.

21:14.965 --> 21:16.308
Can I see Karin now?

21:18.552 --> 21:22.022
Not too sure about that. Perhaps you
could give her a call later or something.

21:23.224 --> 21:29.527
I'd strongly recommend you to just join in the
Game since otherwise you'd be sentenced to jail...

21:30.231 --> 21:32.199
for at least twenty years.

21:37.655 --> 21:38.907
Come on, buddy.

21:46.997 --> 21:48.169
We're waiting, Joe.

21:49.083 --> 21:52.007
Joe, that's quite an unusual
name for a German boy, isn't it?

21:53.003 --> 21:54.220
Are you called Joseph'?

21:54.588 --> 21:55.680
Johannes.

21:56.632 --> 21:58.726
Have you been on telly before, Johannes?

22:00.094 --> 22:00.720
Sorry'?

22:00.803 --> 22:02.646
Very first time on television?

22:03.139 --> 22:04.265
Are you excited?

22:05.266 --> 22:07.327
- Listen, can I make a phone call? Just before we go" do you have a...
- Looking forward?

22:07.351 --> 22:11.106
Okay, just do me a favour Joe. You just
stand in front of the green screen please.

22:11.439 --> 22:12.986
Position yourself on the mark.

22:13.816 --> 22:16.410
- There you go. This is Joe,
one of our new contestants.

22:16.485 --> 22:18.658
He is going lo be featured as a Runner.
- Hey Joe.

22:19.155 --> 22:21.123
- As a runner, fantastic!
- Yes, indeed.

22:22.158 --> 22:23.158
Is he an immigrant?

22:23.826 --> 22:25.578
No, he's one of the good Germans.

22:25.953 --> 22:29.127
Can you show me your hands
please? Just higher, higher. Yes.

22:29.290 --> 22:30.416
Show me your profile please.

22:31.417 --> 22:32.417
Turn around.

22:32.501 --> 22:35.397
- Very good, not as much, not as much.
- No, no, no. Just like this. Just like this, Joe.

22:35.421 --> 22:37.640
Are you excited? You're
perfect for the Game.

22:37.715 --> 22:39.693
- Look at his arms, look at his arms.
- Yeah, yeah.

22:39.717 --> 22:40.717
It's gonna be amazing.

22:40.760 --> 22:42.696
- Come on ya, a little bit excitement.
- Higher, higher. Like He-Man.

22:42.720 --> 22:43.516
Yeah, I don't wanna...

22:43.596 --> 22:45.018
Do you remember He-Man'?

22:45.222 --> 22:47.020
He looks like He-Man, doesn't he?

22:47.767 --> 22:48.939
- Smaller version.
- Come on.

22:49.059 --> 22:50.219
I don't wanna do this, I'm...

22:50.269 --> 22:51.705
- We're working here. You're excited,
cause it's amazing,

22:51.729 --> 22:53.665
you're perfect.
- Can I make a phone call please?

22:53.689 --> 22:55.250
Just position yourself
on the Mark please.

22:55.274 --> 22:58.003
Just a second. We're working here. Then
you can do everything you want, okay.

22:58.027 --> 22:59.747
Can you just give me
a lighter pose, please.

22:59.820 --> 23:00.900
I don't wanna fight... I...

23:01.113 --> 23:03.473
No, no, no... you're not gonna
fight, you're just gonna run!

23:03.824 --> 23:05.302
Don't worry about anything.
I know you're shy,

23:05.326 --> 23:07.579
maybe a little bit nervous,
bu! this is gonna be good.

23:07.703 --> 23:10.297
You look good, you're perfect.
You have a very good body.

23:10.372 --> 23:13.092
It looks like you're in form. Trust
me, it's gonna be fantastic, man.

23:19.715 --> 23:20.932
Three eighteen come in.

23:21.425 --> 23:22.927
This is three eighteen.

23:23.719 --> 23:27.098
It looks like the location of
today's drop point leaked again.

23:27.973 --> 23:30.852
Oh, come on guys. Who's
the whistleblower?

23:31.268 --> 23:32.268
Sorry'?

23:32.812 --> 23:35.986
We know it's one of
you guys. Just admit it.

23:37.733 --> 23:40.031
If we find him, you'll
be the first to know.

23:41.070 --> 23:42.287
That would be a first.

23:42.530 --> 23:44.328
So, we're still going'?

23:45.533 --> 23:49.083
Yes, proceed with caution.
Release the runners at arrival.

23:50.412 --> 23:53.712
The board likes to lake
risks, eh? Roger and out.

23:59.839 --> 24:03.469
Do you know what's gonna happen
next? What's gonna happen now?

24:12.184 --> 24:13.356
Nobody told you'?

24:15.271 --> 24:18.241
Don't worry my friend.
I'll take care of you.

24:19.650 --> 24:21.197
We must slay together.

24:22.778 --> 24:25.201
If you all stay together
we can make this.

24:26.699 --> 24:29.543
We will gel out of
this alive. I promise.

24:30.119 --> 24:32.622
We will make it. Trust me.

25:05.863 --> 25:08.036
They will be waiting for us outside.

25:10.743 --> 25:11.743
My friend...

25:12.620 --> 25:13.746
You go first.

25:14.455 --> 25:17.379
It's our best chance.
I'll be right behind you.

25:22.046 --> 25:23.639
Get ready everyone.

25:24.131 --> 25:30.730
Opening doors in five,
four, three, two, one.

28:09.671 --> 28:11.048
What you gonna do with her'?

28:11.423 --> 28:12.845
We take care of her.

28:16.428 --> 28:19.102
Give it to him. Now.

28:28.982 --> 28:30.825
Sorry, can I make a phone call please?

28:30.901 --> 28:31.697
No phone calls.

28:31.777 --> 28:32.403
Please.

28:32.486 --> 28:33.486
No.

30:25.098 --> 30:26.098
Sorry.

30:44.868 --> 30:45.915
Joe.

30:46.286 --> 30:47.583
Hey sweetie, it's me.

30:48.163 --> 30:50.291
Hey, how are you?

30:50.374 --> 30:52.001
How is your arm'? I saw everything.

30:52.334 --> 30:54.428
Okay, okay. I'm fine.

30:54.920 --> 30:56.388
I'm good sweetie, how are you?

30:56.463 --> 30:59.467
- I love you! I miss you, what the fuck?
- I love you, too.

30:59.549 --> 31:00.391
I miss you, too.

31:00.509 --> 31:02.637
What the fuck!'? What the tuck!

31:02.761 --> 31:06.106
Okay, how is your arm? Did you put
bandages around, do you have a sweater?

31:06.181 --> 31:09.202
You know you need to put something around,
to stop the bleeding, you understand me?

31:09.226 --> 31:12.196
It's okay, it's okay. It's
not so deep. It's okay.

31:12.271 --> 31:15.241
Really, It's okay. I'm on...
I'm on the edge of the city.

31:15.315 --> 31:18.569
I just have to make my way through the
city to Alexander Platz.

31:18.652 --> 31:20.588
- Just leave the game. Just
leave the fucking game

31:20.612 --> 31:22.757
and come back to me.
- Don't... Don't worry, babe. Babe. Hey!

31:22.781 --> 31:25.785
Hey! They put me in prison for
twenty years, if I don't do this.

31:25.867 --> 31:28.541
You don't know that. Are you sure'?

31:28.620 --> 31:31.043
Oh yeah, I'm sure. I'm sure.

31:31.164 --> 31:32.416
No.

31:34.793 --> 31:35.919
No.

31:36.253 --> 31:39.883
I love you. I love you so much.

31:40.841 --> 31:43.194
Could you maybe call into work
and tell them, that I'm sick?

31:43.218 --> 31:44.435
Of course!

31:44.511 --> 31:45.683
I don't wanna involve anyone.

31:45.762 --> 31:48.686
But it's... it's too late. People
are already calling me. They...

31:48.765 --> 31:51.119
They saw what happened and
they are willing to help you.

31:51.144 --> 31:52.589
You're not alone in this.
Please.

31:52.644 --> 31:54.897
Tell them, I'm gonna be back.
Everything is fine.

31:54.922 --> 31:57.174
And don't... And don't gel
anyone involved, okay?

31:57.482 --> 32:00.156
No it's too late for that, everybody
has already seen you on TV.

32:00.319 --> 32:01.821
Please, listen Joe, listen.

32:01.903 --> 32:03.798
Professor Wagner called me
and he is super impressed

32:03.822 --> 32:05.800
by what you did for the runner and he's
willing to help you.

32:05.824 --> 32:08.720
He's willing to meet you on the way to
Alexander Platz and help you with your arm.

32:08.744 --> 32:10.041
Please, this is important.

32:10.120 --> 32:12.418
So he's willing to meet you.
He said just "Cookies".

32:13.582 --> 32:15.084
How appropriate, Baby.

32:15.167 --> 32:17.145
So I think that's a good
sign. Listen, listen, listen.

32:17.169 --> 32:20.440
He's gonna meet you there and he's gonna take
care of it and everything is gonna be okay.

32:20.464 --> 32:23.058
- Thank you baby, thank you baby.
I love you so much. -Okay?

- Okay.

32:32.893 --> 32:34.895
Baby, bye.

33:38.166 --> 33:39.338
So that's it?

34:58.288 --> 34:59.665
Hey, here he is!

35:00.081 --> 35:01.674
You're lucky day, Buddy!

35:02.876 --> 35:03.876

36:16.157 --> 36:17.625
We got to get to the train station.

37:01.620 --> 37:02.837
Are you okay?

37:02.912 --> 37:04.038
Yeah, it's fine.

37:05.624 --> 37:07.342
I know a place, where we can go.

37:08.126 --> 37:09.126
A contact.

37:09.461 --> 37:10.758
A friend of mine.

37:11.338 --> 37:12.214
He's a doctor.

37:12.297 --> 37:12.968
No.

37:13.048 --> 37:14.048
He can help us.

37:15.008 --> 37:16.134
Why should anybody help?

37:16.843 --> 37:18.311
He's a friend.

37:19.554 --> 37:21.181
Enough, you idiots.

37:22.140 --> 37:23.437
Let's go.

Hey... hey.

56:13.145 --> 56:15.443
Now I continue to fight, to live.

things to each other.

56:38.378 --> 56:39.800
Why are you in this game'?

56:42.007 --> 56:43.475
Because I helped a runner.

56:44.343 --> 56:45.463
I killed one of the Hunters.

56:50.432 --> 56:51.558
Was an accident.

57:04.947 --> 57:06.665
Joe, we have lo leave her somewhere.

57:10.118 --> 57:11.961

01:00:05.377 --> 01:00:07.630
Joe, they will gel us. I'm going now.

01:00:59.056 --> 01:01:00.729
Joe, Joe, hey!

01:01:00.807 --> 01:01:03.060
It's Karin. Okay, come on. let's go.

01:01:08.982 --> 01:01:10.108
Joe!

01:01:17.532 --> 01:01:19.500
Are you crazy, are you crazy?

01:01:19.576 --> 01:01:21.544
- You can't come here!
- Are you okay?

01:01:22.162 --> 01:01:23.162
Are you alright?

01:01:23.914 --> 01:01:25.086
It's okay.

01:01:25.749 --> 01:01:27.001
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

01:01:27.084 --> 01:01:29.086
- Where you taking us?
- Go!

01:01:29.419 --> 01:01:30.841
You're in the game now!

01:01:31.463 --> 01:01:32.510
Go. go!

01:01:40.180 --> 01:01:41.180
Go.

01:01:45.227 --> 01:01:47.696
- I told you, not to come.
I told you, no! to come.

01:01:47.813 --> 01:01:50.500
You're gonna be pan of the Game. I could
not leave you, I could not leave you.

01:01:50.524 --> 01:01:52.071
I don't care, I don't care.

01:01:52.484 --> 01:01:53.484
Who's this?

01:01:53.652 --> 01:01:55.838
- It's family, it's okay. It's okay.
- I wanna go home, please.

01:01:55.862 --> 01:01:57.205
Push this down.

01:01:58.532 --> 01:02:00.000
It's not stopping.

01:02:00.325 --> 01:02:01.668
Push hard, you gotta push hard.

01:02:01.743 --> 01:02:02.995
<i>Okay-</i>

01:02:03.328 --> 01:02:05.706
- Okay, okay. Focus!
- It's okay.

01:02:18.426 --> 01:02:19.518
I'm not gonna leave you!

01:02:20.971 --> 01:02:22.824
I think they gonna hunt
you, they gonna kill you.

01:02:22.848 --> 01:02:25.159
- I don't care. I'm not gonna leave you.
- You know what they're gonna do to you?

01:02:25.183 --> 01:02:25.900
You don't know, baby.

01:02:25.976 --> 01:02:26.898
I'm not gonna leave you.

01:02:26.977 --> 01:02:27.773
You don't know, baby.

01:02:27.853 --> 01:02:29.321
I'm not gonna leave you.

01:02:30.605 --> 01:02:31.605
So what's our option?

01:02:31.857 --> 01:02:33.074
We go lo the shelter.

01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:34.993
Okay. We have to go there.

01:02:35.443 --> 01:02:39.118
Gel armed. And than.
Maybe we can survive.

01:02:39.447 --> 01:02:40.073
Okay'?

01:02:40.157 --> 01:02:41.843
- No, it's the same as the doctor.
We have to go the other way.

01:02:41.867 --> 01:02:43.845
He knows the place. It's okay, it's
okay. It's a shelter. It's a shelter.

01:02:43.869 --> 01:02:44.540
- We were so close.

01:02:44.619 --> 01:02:47.998
The shelter is for the... It's in the
Game. It's in the Game. It's okay.

01:02:51.793 --> 01:02:53.215
We'll be there soon.

01:02:57.132 --> 01:02:58.805
I love you.

01:03:44.471 --> 01:03:45.097
Get out.

01:03:45.180 --> 01:03:46.180
Okay, go!

01:03:51.102 --> 01:03:52.102
Joe.

01:04:00.862 --> 01:04:01.862
Are you okay?

01:04:03.657 --> 01:04:05.034
What the fuck?

01:04:06.076 --> 01:04:07.077
He was on the bus.

01:04:09.204 --> 01:04:10.204
Where's your friend?

01:04:10.580 --> 01:04:11.580
He's dead.

01:04:12.999 --> 01:04:13.999
I'm sorry.

01:04:18.755 --> 01:04:19.755
The doors.

01:04:23.176 --> 01:04:25.178
Hey, stay with me, slay with me.

01:04:30.058 --> 01:04:33.312
I know that it was you, who
saved him. I know that.

01:04:35.563 --> 01:04:36.735
Anything you need'?

01:04:36.815 --> 01:04:39.364
Yeah, get some water, gel some
water. She needs lo drink up.

01:04:39.484 --> 01:04:42.296
Just a second, just press down, okay.
You're gonna be fine. You're gonna be fine.

01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:44.920
Slay with me, look at me, look at
me, look a! men. Sit up, sit up!

01:04:59.713 --> 01:05:00.713
<i>Okay-</i>

01:05:01.548 --> 01:05:02.549
What now?

01:05:02.882 --> 01:05:05.180
We have to find a way, to
make it through the Hunters.

01:05:06.094 --> 01:05:07.471
And then we have to split up.

01:05:07.679 --> 01:05:09.977
I'm gonna... I'm gonna go
with her. And with him.

01:05:10.390 --> 01:05:11.437
And you'll go.

01:05:11.683 --> 01:05:13.226
And go where, and go where.
I thought that's...

01:05:13.251 --> 01:05:14.704
I thought we came here for what?
-You can go.

01:05:14.728 --> 01:05:16.150
- You two will go.
- No.

01:05:16.229 --> 01:05:17.105
Yes, of course.

01:05:17.188 --> 01:05:19.041
- I'm not gonna leave you.
- He has to make it lo the finish line.

01:05:19.065 --> 01:05:21.945
You didn't kill anyone, they can attack
you, but you're free to go, baby.

01:05:22.068 --> 01:05:25.993
Maybe we can split up. I take care of
you. And you make it lo the finish line.

01:05:26.072 --> 01:05:28.050
- I'm gonna go now. I'm gonna go now.
- No, no. - Karin!

01:05:28.074 --> 01:05:29.927
- No, no! - Yeah, we have to split up.
- We have lo.

01:05:29.951 --> 01:05:32.124
No, no. Are you fucking kidding me'?

01:05:32.329 --> 01:05:33.329
No, I'm not leaving you.

01:05:33.371 --> 01:05:34.998
- I might die tonight.
- No, no.

01:05:35.290 --> 01:05:37.463
No, I'm not gonna
fucking raise a kid alone.

01:05:51.181 --> 01:05:54.105
I'm not gonna leave you, I'm not gonna
leave you, I'm not gonna leave you.

01:05:55.393 --> 01:05:56.144
You have to go.

01:05:56.394 --> 01:05:59.648
- No, I'm slaying. No, no.
- Please.

01:06:00.315 --> 01:06:01.362
No, I'm slaying.

01:06:10.075 --> 01:06:11.075
Man...

01:06:17.248 --> 01:06:18.248
Okay, okay.

01:06:18.708 --> 01:06:20.381
We need weapons.

01:06:20.460 --> 01:06:21.803
Baby, you slay by my side, okay?

01:06:22.837 --> 01:06:24.760
You just slay close to us, or behind us.

01:06:24.923 --> 01:06:27.096
- You take a slick.
- I check, I check the other boxes.

01:06:27.425 --> 01:06:29.803
And baby, you go for the head. Okay?

01:06:42.732 --> 01:06:43.733
He's one of the killers.

01:06:43.817 --> 01:06:45.319
Here are knifes. Knifes.

01:06:45.527 --> 01:06:46.449
It's okay, he's my brother.

01:06:46.528 --> 01:06:48.451
I saw him, he's one of the killers.

01:06:49.239 --> 01:06:51.458
No, it's okay. He saved us.

01:06:51.533 --> 01:06:53.969
Who drove him here, who brought him
here? How he know the save place.

01:06:53.993 --> 01:06:56.087
He was driving. It's okay.

01:06:56.329 --> 01:06:58.081
He's one of the killers. I saw him.

01:06:59.249 --> 01:07:00.876
I don't even trust you, man.

01:07:08.049 --> 01:07:09.972
Alex, Alex!

01:08:20.747 --> 01:08:24.091
Joe, Joe please. Joel

01:08:24.876 --> 01:08:25.502
Joe.

01:08:25.585 --> 01:08:29.680
Slop, stop, stop, stop.

01:08:30.673 --> 01:08:34.098
Stop. Stop you two, stop!

01:08:36.679 --> 01:08:37.895
Stop!

01:08:40.140 --> 01:08:41.939
If you're one of them, you can help us.

01:08:45.438 --> 01:08:48.783
Just tell them, there are enough other
people to hunt, they don't have to hunt us.

01:08:56.616 --> 01:08:58.710
What are you saying. Go outside!

01:09:05.332 --> 01:09:08.051
It's not gonna work. We have
to... We will have to fight.

01:09:08.377 --> 01:09:09.675
You get your weapons?

01:09:10.004 --> 01:09:12.756
Here, all the time here,
like I showed you, okay?

01:09:13.466 --> 01:09:14.786
You go for the head all the time.

01:09:14.841 --> 01:09:17.015
And you'll stay with ma. All the time.

01:09:25.937 --> 01:09:29.908
You focus and you slay behind him.
He will protect you, but focus, okay?

01:09:30.649 --> 01:09:31.526
We'll take the front, okay?

01:09:31.609 --> 01:09:32.609
Yeah.

01:09:33.987 --> 01:09:34.987
You're ready?

01:09:35.697 --> 01:09:36.697
Yeah.

01:09:47.332 --> 01:09:48.332
<i>Okay-</i>

01:09:53.673 --> 01:09:54.673
Lex...

01:10:40.345 --> 01:10:45.977
Who's not for me is against me. And
who's against me is my fucking enemy.

01:11:00.823 --> 01:11:01.823
You're ready?

01:11:26.808 --> 01:11:27.980
Hey, let's go to run.

01:11:28.601 --> 01:11:29.601
No, stay!

01:11:55.044 --> 01:11:56.044
Go back!

01:12:43.009 --> 01:12:44.009
Joe!

01:13:19.754 --> 01:13:20.846
Help!

01:13:37.104 --> 01:13:38.104
No.

01:14:15.977 --> 01:14:19.197
Come on, gel up! Get up,
get up, get up, get up!

01:14:49.552 --> 01:14:51.600
I heard about what you did to the doc.

01:14:52.555 --> 01:14:54.557
It's all over the news.

01:14:55.516 --> 01:14:57.063
Couldn't have done it better myself.

01:14:57.143 --> 01:14:58.360
Let's kill him.

01:14:59.061 --> 01:15:01.484
He deserved it, you know?

01:15:19.498 --> 01:15:21.000
I told you, we meet again.

01:15:21.959 --> 01:15:23.256
There's no point in running.

01:15:24.045 --> 01:15:25.422
No, no, no, no. Alex.

01:15:26.380 --> 01:15:27.677
You can't save them.

01:15:28.716 --> 01:15:30.184
You can't even save yourself.

01:15:31.594 --> 01:15:35.189
Face what you did, and
what you'll become.

01:15:36.390 --> 01:15:37.390
Are you ready?

01:16:55.594 --> 01:16:56.811
Good fig ht.

01:16:57.805 --> 01:16:59.148
Bu! you won't make it lo the end.

01:17:00.808 --> 01:17:03.152
You have to take pleasure in violence.

01:17:06.272 --> 01:17:08.695
That's the way I won the last game.

01:17:11.986 --> 01:17:13.704
I scared them to death.

01:17:19.326 --> 01:17:21.954
Bu! we're different, you and I.

01:17:22.830 --> 01:17:25.333
See, I had nothing to lose.

01:17:27.334 --> 01:17:29.928
Bu! you... your family...

01:17:31.630 --> 01:17:32.630
is your weakness.

01:17:34.550 --> 01:17:36.769
Go on, do it!

01:17:37.928 --> 01:17:39.180
You can't do it.

01:17:41.140 --> 01:17:42.140
You can't do it.

01:17:43.642 --> 01:17:44.894
You gonna lose your life.

01:17:46.312 --> 01:17:47.564
They gonna kill you.

01:20:50.246 --> 01:20:52.499
I saw you on TV. You
were the bomb, for real!

01:20:58.420 --> 01:20:59.420
You wanker!

01:21:00.839 --> 01:21:01.839
Joe!

01:21:04.635 --> 01:21:05.635
Joe!

01:21:06.428 --> 01:21:07.428
Kari n?

01:21:09.390 --> 01:21:10.390
Joe!

01:21:15.062 --> 01:21:15.688
Fuck you!

01:21:15.813 --> 01:21:18.236
Joe, Joe, Joe!

01:21:18.315 --> 01:21:19.315
Joe!

01:22:37.019 --> 01:22:38.566
We have to go, Joe.

01:23:23.649 --> 01:23:27.028
They are on top of this months
ranking, because you put them there.

01:23:27.111 --> 01:23:30.536
You love them, and I love them. They
are our new Hunter dream team.

01:23:30.614 --> 01:23:34.039
I'm so glad, they're here tonight.
Faizah and Joe. Welcome to the show.

01:23:34.118 --> 01:23:35.244
How are you guys'?

01:23:35.494 --> 01:23:37.462
Hello Marty. I'm great, thank you.

01:23:37.704 --> 01:23:38.704
Hi.

01:23:39.039 --> 01:23:40.256
Thanks for having us here.

01:23:40.666 --> 01:23:41.667
Good to have you.

01:23:42.042 --> 01:23:48.641
I mean Joe, the return to the show brought us
the most violent, the most fun hunts ever.

01:23:49.049 --> 01:23:51.177
Everyone who saw your
epic run six month ago

01:23:51.260 --> 01:23:53.433
wanted you back on the show,
so my question to you...

01:23:53.512 --> 01:23:58.359
I think, everyone is asking themselves,
what made you decide to become a Hunter?

01:24:02.938 --> 01:24:03.938
You know...

01:24:05.149 --> 01:24:06.901
There are many reasons,
to become a Hunter.

01:24:08.569 --> 01:24:10.492
The excitement, the money...

01:24:10.571 --> 01:24:11.571
Yeah.

01:24:12.239 --> 01:24:14.617
But you know for me it
was a personal decision.

01:24:15.659 --> 01:24:17.582
And that's what it always
comes down to, eh?

01:24:17.786 --> 01:24:19.584
Personal decisions.

01:24:20.289 --> 01:24:22.166
Exactly. I had to learn it the hard way.

01:24:22.249 --> 01:24:24.843
You know, before I sold insurances.

01:24:25.961 --> 01:24:28.805
I remember that, but an
insurance can't protect

01:24:28.881 --> 01:24:31.976
you from a life lesson, god has
in store for you, am I right?

01:24:32.718 --> 01:24:35.062
You're right Marty, you're right.

01:24:36.680 --> 01:24:39.854
You can't buy happiness,
you can't buy security.

01:24:40.601 --> 01:24:44.356
You only can do what you're best at,
right? What you're really good at.

01:24:45.772 --> 01:24:48.275
And I'm a fighter. And
I'm really good at it.

01:24:49.401 --> 01:24:53.577
Oh you were good at it, Joe. Wasn't he
good at it? I mean, he was so good at it.

01:24:54.156 --> 01:24:56.500
Let's have a look at Joes highlights.

01:25:01.538 --> 01:25:04.007
Right there, that was just incredible.

01:25:10.047 --> 01:25:14.348
I've got one word to say to
you, Joe: Wow! Just wow.

01:25:14.635 --> 01:25:15.635
Thanks Marty.

01:25:16.094 --> 01:25:21.396
And Faizah, what made you decide
to save Joe in the first place?

01:25:21.475 --> 01:25:22.772
I mean he's a good-looking guy.

01:25:23.769 --> 01:25:27.364
My mother taught me, that the
strong have lo protect the weak.

01:25:28.941 --> 01:25:31.069
Well, that's admirable, but...

01:25:32.152 --> 01:25:37.033
Being a Hunter now you now have
to kill in order lo protect society.

01:25:37.366 --> 01:25:39.118
How does that affect you personally?

01:25:42.246 --> 01:25:44.374
It's never easy to take a life.

01:25:45.749 --> 01:25:49.253
Some critics recently
called the show inhumane.

01:25:49.628 --> 01:25:53.007
Some of them even said, it's a fascist
fantasy, and I'm quoting this here.

01:25:53.090 --> 01:25:58.347
A fascist fantasy of a Darwinian world of
survival, to separate the strong from the weak.

01:25:58.971 --> 01:26:02.350
Now that is quite a strong statement.
How do you feel about that?

01:26:03.725 --> 01:26:04.977
I don't think that's true.

01:26:06.144 --> 01:26:09.068
Now they have to understand,
this game is about democracy.

01:26:10.232 --> 01:26:11.449
And why is that'?

01:26:12.442 --> 01:26:14.945
Cause democracy is
about participation, right?

01:26:15.445 --> 01:26:17.994
Only through the act oi
participation of the people...

01:26:18.782 --> 01:26:20.876
we're able to remain democratic.

01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:27.382
So... being a Hunter, to get
this right, is a democratic act?

01:26:28.750 --> 01:26:30.093
No, no, no...

01:26:31.420 --> 01:26:33.047
It's not about being a Hunter, it's...

01:26:33.922 --> 01:26:38.974
See if you wanna be pan of this society you
have to show your willingness to participate.

01:26:40.220 --> 01:26:42.643
And this game, as hard, as it is...

01:26:44.433 --> 01:26:46.106
ls a test of this will.

01:26:49.396 --> 01:26:53.742
Surviving the game made me
an active part of society, and...

01:26:54.860 --> 01:26:56.453
and everyone can do this.

01:26:59.323 --> 01:27:02.076
Everyone can. So can you!

01:27:03.327 --> 01:27:04.453
I do it every day.

01:27:07.664 --> 01:27:11.294
Joe, your brave intervention
didn't save the Runners life.

01:27:11.501 --> 01:27:15.506
Instead it brought you into the
Game, and changed your life forever.

01:27:15.631 --> 01:27:17.804
So in hindsight, how
do you feel about that?

01:27:21.219 --> 01:27:22.345
'Nan

01:27:23.889 --> 01:27:26.984
You know I was... kind
of living a false life.

01:27:29.227 --> 01:27:31.480
I didn't recognize what
was happening around me.

01:27:34.024 --> 01:27:38.325
To inter... to intervene was
my first step to participation.

01:27:41.031 --> 01:27:43.125
That was, what I learned
about myself, and...

01:27:45.327 --> 01:27:48.376
I will never forget that.
I'm thankful for that.

01:27:50.457 --> 01:27:53.961
And... how about the two of you?

01:27:55.212 --> 01:27:58.056
Are you... just a team'?

01:28:04.429 --> 01:28:08.024
We found each other in
a time of personal crisis.

01:28:10.769 --> 01:28:12.897
Very diplomatic of you to say.

01:28:13.271 --> 01:28:14.944
But, ah... well.

01:28:15.023 --> 01:28:20.996
I'm sure the audience, you at home and me as
well, we will all remember Joes darkest moments.

01:28:23.907 --> 01:28:28.538
You know, sometimes you need a human being
to lead you through the darkness, right?

01:28:28.745 --> 01:28:31.624
Oh I feel you. I'm right there with you.

01:28:33.166 --> 01:28:35.669
So what are your
plans... for the future?

01:28:36.336 --> 01:28:38.964
If it's true what they say, it's
gonna be a cold and long winter

01:28:39.047 --> 01:28:43.427
and there won't be many refugees
taking part in the Game.

01:28:44.553 --> 01:28:48.603
So yeah, maybe we take a break.
Go on holiday somewhere.

01:28:49.433 --> 01:28:50.980
Or on honeymoon?

01:28:53.186 --> 01:28:55.689
I'm just messing with
you guys. No, really.

01:28:55.772 --> 01:28:57.866
It was great having
you on the show and...

01:28:58.108 --> 01:29:03.080
I mean I don't know about you, but I know that
I will be sleeping save and soundly at night

01:29:03.155 --> 01:29:07.251
because I know these two guys will
be protecting my life of small dreams.

01:29:07.409 --> 01:29:10.003
So, Faizah and Joe, thank you
for being my guest tonight.

01:29:10.078 --> 01:29:12.957
I see you brought your gear.
Maybe you can put it on?

01:29:13.665 --> 01:29:16.635
So the audience can see you in
full glory, the way they love you?

01:29:17.836 --> 01:29:23.343
And you stay tuned for the upcoming live-feed
of tonight's episode of "Immigration Game".

01:29:23.425 --> 01:29:24.551
Thank you for watching.

01:29:29.097 --> 01:29:30.565
Alright, thank you so much.

01:29:31.141 --> 01:29:32.233
Thank you so much.

01:29:38.356 --> 01:29:39.824
All right. It's a wrap.

01:29:40.525 --> 01:29:42.198
This way, someone will help you.

01:29:42.611 --> 01:29:44.113
Bye, bye.
