00:18.018 --> 00:19.812
<i>Previously on </i> Bad Blood.

00:19.895 --> 00:21.188
Running things all alone

00:21.272 --> 00:23.273
comes with problems
you can't even imagine.

00:23.357 --> 00:24.692
I don't work for anyone.

00:24.775 --> 00:27.615
They want us to move to fentanyl.
A few grains of this can kill someone.

00:27.695 --> 00:29.530
<i>You're married to the one capo</i>

00:29.613 --> 00:31.742
<i>who wants to share
his feelings with his wife.</i>

00:31.825 --> 00:33.702
- What do you have for me?
- Nothing.

00:33.785 --> 00:37.663
We are now in possession
of Declan's entire shipment.

00:37.747 --> 00:38.873
Good work.

00:38.957 --> 00:42.127
- I need you to find two people for me.
- Let me guess, twins?

00:42.210 --> 00:44.670
We took your drugs.
We're gonna take your city.

00:45.630 --> 00:48.090
We have heard of your little problems.

00:48.173 --> 00:50.635
Our payment deadline
is still the same date.

00:50.718 --> 00:51.970
Understood.

00:52.053 --> 00:55.765
If you reconsider our offer,
we will return your shipment.

00:55.848 --> 00:57.100
You've read me all wrong.

00:59.018 --> 01:00.103
Get down!

01:00.687 --> 01:02.897
I'm suddenly needing
a place to stay, Rose.

01:02.980 --> 01:05.150
No one's gonna look for me here.

01:05.233 --> 01:07.193
We need to find Declan. I want him dead.

01:07.277 --> 01:08.360
<i>We need to end this.</i>

01:18.538 --> 01:20.248
Where's Declan?

01:21.207 --> 01:23.752
I don't know.

01:31.425 --> 01:33.218
Where is he?

01:34.387 --> 01:35.597
I don't know.

01:35.680 --> 01:37.432
Tell us where he is,

01:37.515 --> 01:39.808
and all this can be over.

01:43.813 --> 01:45.148
I don't know.

01:57.910 --> 02:01.832
Declan doesn't leave much of a footprint,
as you can imagine.

02:03.082 --> 02:05.460
So we have people
who locate others for us,

02:05.543 --> 02:09.255
and all they could find
was that this year, out of nowhere,

02:10.130 --> 02:13.593
he starts visiting you in prison,
every week.

02:13.677 --> 02:17.472
And then he arranges for you
to live with him during your parole.

02:23.770 --> 02:26.857
That is quite a lot for a nephew, hmm?

02:39.952 --> 02:41.662
Where is Declan?

02:44.623 --> 02:46.208
Where is he?

02:46.833 --> 02:49.295
Stop. Stop! Stop!

02:49.378 --> 02:51.505
Stop! I don't know!

02:51.588 --> 02:54.300
He just told me that he's moving around.

02:54.383 --> 02:57.762
I don't know where he is! I don't know!

03:33.255 --> 03:35.842
- This is the only time I've seen them.
- You lost them.

03:35.925 --> 03:37.135
- Declan, I...
- You lost them.

03:37.218 --> 03:40.263
I followed them after the meeting.
They each had their own car and a decoy.

03:40.347 --> 03:43.307
It was like an eggshell game.
I wasn't expecting that at all.

03:43.390 --> 03:44.683
I'll find them. Don't worry.

03:44.767 --> 03:46.602
Not that I've ever seen you worry.

03:46.685 --> 03:48.605
- Or blink or sleep.
- What else you got?

03:48.688 --> 03:51.523
Domenic and Enzo meet daily,
usual mobster stuff,

03:51.607 --> 03:54.110
a lot of food and coffee.

03:54.193 --> 03:57.655
And Luca, he works out, and he gets laid.

03:57.738 --> 03:59.323
The single life.

03:59.407 --> 04:02.160
And Nats, he stays home
to watch their baby,

04:02.243 --> 04:04.537
so his wife can go to yoga
or get a manicure.

04:04.620 --> 04:06.830
Next time I have eyes on them,
I'll find them.

04:06.913 --> 04:08.373
- That's for you.
- Alright.

04:08.457 --> 04:10.960
I'll upload new stuff
to my private server when I have it.

04:11.043 --> 04:12.087
Alright.

04:12.878 --> 04:14.130
How's Reggie?

04:14.963 --> 04:17.466
He's good.
Thanks for doing that.

04:18.550 --> 04:19.968
Saw the meds he's taking.

04:21.053 --> 04:23.555
Had a girlfriend
who was on a lot of that stuff too.

04:23.640 --> 04:25.098
It's hard to deal with.

04:25.182 --> 04:26.850
You can't take that all on yourself.

04:26.933 --> 04:28.310
Thanks, Mum.

04:45.370 --> 04:48.122
<i>It's a touching story,
your nephew just told us.</i>

04:48.957 --> 04:52.793
Your sister dies at 18, overdose.
You have no one left.

04:53.753 --> 04:56.880
<i>Then years later,
Reggie contacts you from prison.</i>

04:56.963 --> 05:00.885
He didn't know her,
and you didn't know he existed.

05:00.968 --> 05:02.387
But he found you.

05:02.470 --> 05:05.598
<i>And just like that,
you're no longer alone.</i>

05:05.682 --> 05:07.975
I've rarely been apart from my brother

05:08.058 --> 05:10.227
for more than a few weeks.

05:11.312 --> 05:13.647
I can't imagine what
that must have felt like.

05:14.607 --> 05:16.233
What do you want?

05:16.317 --> 05:18.695
<i>I want this mess between us
to be over with.</i>

05:18.778 --> 05:20.655
I promise,

05:20.738 --> 05:23.157
our bond, our word, he will live.

05:23.742 --> 05:25.493
<i>Our family reputation</i>

05:25.577 --> 05:27.412
<i>is built upon the honour
of our agreements.</i>

05:27.495 --> 05:28.747
Shut up.

05:28.830 --> 05:31.373
I don't, I don't give a crap about that.

05:31.457 --> 05:32.917
I'm gonna, I'm gonna kill you,

05:33.000 --> 05:34.752
then I'm gonna kill your brother,

05:34.835 --> 05:36.795
then I'm gonna take everything you've got.

05:36.878 --> 05:38.338
No, you won't.

05:38.422 --> 05:39.923
<i>Andiamo.</i>

05:40.007 --> 05:43.260
<i>You will be receiving coordinates shortly.</i>

05:43.343 --> 05:44.553
If you want him to live,

05:44.637 --> 05:46.388
you have three hours to present yourself.

05:46.472 --> 05:48.725
Until then, the torture continues.

05:51.185 --> 05:53.478
Oh man, oh man, oh man...

05:53.562 --> 05:55.188
What is it?

06:04.282 --> 06:05.617
Declan, what is it?

06:05.700 --> 06:08.493
I've got three hours to save Reggie.

06:09.578 --> 06:11.747
Declan, what's going on?

06:18.212 --> 06:20.172
How old is Nats' baby?

06:20.255 --> 06:22.425
Uh, about a year old? Why?

06:24.593 --> 06:25.970
You trust me?

06:26.053 --> 06:28.055
Of course, whatever you need.

06:28.138 --> 06:29.807
I need your car.

06:31.933 --> 06:33.268
The car seat.

06:43.780 --> 06:45.782
There are lines
no one should cross.

06:45.865 --> 06:47.408
Yeah, and they crossed it.

06:47.492 --> 06:49.160
It's almost been three hours.

06:49.243 --> 06:50.995
If you're gonna do this, you gotta go.

07:30.702 --> 07:32.912
You listen to me now, OK? I'm talking.

07:38.792 --> 07:41.545
Yeah, three months ago,
you promised me it was gonna stop

07:41.628 --> 07:43.505
when I spoke to your manager on the phone.

07:43.588 --> 07:46.717
Well, two months ago,
I was in your location, OK,

07:46.800 --> 07:49.512
and I spoke to a Brianna
or something like that.

07:57.312 --> 07:59.813
Hey. Hey. Can you hear me?

08:00.815 --> 08:02.942
Nod your head if you can hear me.

08:08.363 --> 08:10.198
You know who I am?

08:12.535 --> 08:14.995
Do ya?

08:17.415 --> 08:18.958
Listen to me.

08:19.667 --> 08:21.668
Teresa and Christian...

08:22.837 --> 08:24.547
they kidnapped someone

08:24.630 --> 08:26.757
very important to me.

08:29.885 --> 08:31.178
Reggie.

08:32.847 --> 08:34.182
Did you know about this?

08:35.683 --> 08:37.309
- Did you?
- No.

08:38.143 --> 08:40.062
You know what? I believe you.

08:41.230 --> 08:44.858
Now, if this is just about the drugs
that they stole from me,

08:44.942 --> 08:46.318
I wouldn't be here, Nats.

08:47.528 --> 08:49.030
But they went too far.

08:49.113 --> 08:51.323
Domenic and your papa,

08:51.407 --> 08:54.035
would they do something like this? No.

08:54.118 --> 08:56.953
No, they wouldn't.
And now I have to stop them.

08:57.830 --> 09:01.167
And there's only one way
your family is gonna listen.

09:02.252 --> 09:04.212
So, here's what I want.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.257
I want Reggie back alive.

09:07.340 --> 09:11.010
I want five million
for the drugs you stole.

09:11.093 --> 09:13.930
Do as I say,
and this will be over fast and easy.

09:16.807 --> 09:18.517
Nats...

09:20.060 --> 09:22.103
I do not wanna be here right now.

09:22.187 --> 09:23.313
I don't.

09:23.397 --> 09:26.025
I don't wanna do what I'm about to do.

09:26.108 --> 09:28.027
This is gonna be tough on me,

09:28.110 --> 09:31.447
but nowhere near as tough
as it's gonna be on you.

09:36.285 --> 09:38.828
Pop. Let's call him.

09:44.252 --> 09:46.170
<i>Hello, my son. I was just thinking...</i>

09:46.253 --> 09:48.547
Enzo, don't talk. This is Declan.

09:49.632 --> 09:51.925
- You listen to me very carefully, Enzo.
- <i>Where's my son?</i>

09:52.008 --> 09:54.970
Those twins, they kidnaped my nephew.

09:55.053 --> 09:57.180
<i>- What are you saying?</i>
- And they're torturing him.

09:57.263 --> 09:59.826
<i>- What are you talking about?</i>
- You call them and tell them to stop.

09:59.850 --> 10:02.090
- I want him back.
<i>- It has nothing to do with any of us!</i>

10:02.143 --> 10:05.732
<i>- What's happening, Declan? Please...</i>
- Or you'll never ever...

10:05.815 --> 10:08.150
gonna see your grandson alive again.

10:08.233 --> 10:10.318
Don't touch him! You son of a bitch!

10:10.402 --> 10:12.988
<i>- What are you doing?</i>
- Don't touch him! Pop!

10:13.072 --> 10:14.990
Pop, he's taking Adamo.

10:15.073 --> 10:17.368
- Stop! Stop!
<i>- Get back on the phone!</i>

10:17.452 --> 10:18.827
Stop!

10:18.910 --> 10:22.122
No! No!

10:22.205 --> 10:23.915
No!

10:42.643 --> 10:45.980
Diapers, formula and food.

10:47.565 --> 10:50.567
Ah, he's still calm. That's good.

10:52.235 --> 10:54.530
OK, so, what's the plan?

10:55.655 --> 10:57.658
You can't just drive around with a baby.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.703
There's a crappy motel five miles east.

11:00.787 --> 11:02.328
Mainly truckers and hookers, but...

11:02.413 --> 11:04.498
No. No, even crappy hotels
have security cameras.

11:04.582 --> 11:06.792
I'm staying at Bobby's reserve.
I can hole out there.

11:07.543 --> 11:09.378
This is gonna go down fast
when it goes down.

11:09.462 --> 11:12.798
Shelley, I need that car seat,
and I could use your car.

11:12.882 --> 11:15.008
I'll get them both back to you, I promise.

11:15.092 --> 11:16.718
Declan, it's a two-hour drive.

11:16.802 --> 11:19.055
He's gonna need to eat.
He's gonna need to be changed.

11:19.138 --> 11:21.432
- Well, I...
- You're a badass gangster

11:21.515 --> 11:23.892
who I totally trust with my life,
but you're not a mother.

11:25.060 --> 11:27.103
Let's go.

11:34.612 --> 11:37.407
Why are we still here?
Why are we even still talking?

11:37.490 --> 11:39.783
We'll give him what he wants,
and that's that.

11:39.867 --> 11:42.828
So please tell me where this ass is
so we can get this over with, please.

11:42.912 --> 11:46.123
Ignazio,
we cannot let Declan dictate the terms.

11:46.207 --> 11:48.667
Yes, we can.
No, he's dictating the terms, OK?

11:48.750 --> 11:51.837
He's got my son, and he wants what?
His nephew and his money.

11:51.920 --> 11:53.672
So, guess what,
we're gonna give it to him.

11:53.755 --> 11:55.423
This is a negotiation, OK?

11:55.507 --> 11:58.343
We made an offer, he countered,
and now it's our turn.

11:58.427 --> 12:01.097
It's not negotiation. It's a war.

12:01.180 --> 12:02.305
And you started it, OK?

12:02.388 --> 12:04.767
We told you not to, and you did anyway.

12:04.850 --> 12:07.143
Now Declan has hit back,
and he hit back hard.

12:07.227 --> 12:09.355
So now you're gonna tell me
where Reggie is.

12:09.438 --> 12:11.482
- Wait. Wait.
- Where is he?

12:12.315 --> 12:14.985
Dom, we can get two mil
from the sportsbook.

12:15.068 --> 12:17.668
- I got a mil in the safe.
- I got your back. I'll cover the rest.

12:17.697 --> 12:20.157
- OK. That's done.
- Spend your money however you wish.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.785
But you have nothing to negotiate
without the nephew.

12:22.868 --> 12:25.412
You son of a bitch! You son of a bitch!

12:25.495 --> 12:27.372
Nothing to negotiate? Nothing?

12:27.457 --> 12:29.500
Hey. This isn't your decision, OK?

12:29.583 --> 12:32.127
Declan is not going to harm your son.

12:32.210 --> 12:34.338
- How can you say that?
- Because I met the man.

12:34.422 --> 12:36.548
I looked into his eyes.
He doesn't have it in him.

12:36.632 --> 12:38.383
I don't care what you have to say anymore.

12:38.467 --> 12:41.803
I don't wanna hear anything out
of your mouth except for where Reggie is.

12:41.887 --> 12:44.807
You are not thinking rationally right now,
OK?

12:44.890 --> 12:46.808
And that is why we,

12:46.892 --> 12:48.935
we will be handling this negotiation.

12:49.018 --> 12:50.270
We are impartial.

12:50.353 --> 12:53.898
Oh, what did do you say? You're impar...

12:55.400 --> 12:56.860
Impartial? Impartial, yeah?

12:56.943 --> 12:59.028
- Are you impartial now?
- Nats, calm down!

12:59.112 --> 13:01.073
You still impartial now?
Cos now you're in it.

13:01.157 --> 13:03.700
- You take that gun out of my son's face.
- Where's Reggie?

13:06.745 --> 13:08.497
Where is Reggie?

13:09.540 --> 13:11.208
Now you're looking in my eyes.

13:11.917 --> 13:13.877
Do I have it in me?

13:17.507 --> 13:19.132
Enzo, Enzo, Enzo.

13:19.967 --> 13:21.760
Under any other circumstance,

13:21.843 --> 13:24.972
your son would already be dead.

13:25.055 --> 13:26.723
You don't talk to me like that.

13:26.807 --> 13:28.850
Nats, please don't make things worse.

13:28.933 --> 13:30.435
Put that goddamn gun down.

13:30.518 --> 13:32.437
Not until he tells me where Reggie is,
Pop.

13:32.522 --> 13:35.482
I'm not putting this gun down
until you tell me where Reggie is.

13:37.108 --> 13:39.862
Good for you, Nats. Good for you, bravo.

13:41.113 --> 13:42.823
Do what you think is right.

13:54.918 --> 13:56.170
Stop.

13:59.673 --> 14:02.175
What are we gonna do right now?
We're gonna shoot each other?

14:02.258 --> 14:04.762
Do you see what this animal
is doing to us?

14:04.845 --> 14:07.138
This is not what family does.
Do you understand that?

14:07.222 --> 14:09.558
Now, both of you, listen to me.

14:09.642 --> 14:11.185
You take a goddamn breath.

14:16.815 --> 14:19.150
Lower your gun, please, Siro.

14:22.362 --> 14:23.988
We will try this your way.

14:25.198 --> 14:26.325
Down.

14:26.950 --> 14:28.660
Come on.

14:28.743 --> 14:30.453
Save your son. Save your son.

14:37.628 --> 14:38.712
Finally.

14:39.755 --> 14:41.840
I was pleasantly surprised
when I got your text.

14:42.758 --> 14:45.385
Did you just feel like
having some girl time or...

14:46.428 --> 14:47.847
do you have something to tell me?

14:51.100 --> 14:53.643
The family was being asked
to move into fentanyl.

14:54.770 --> 14:56.188
What do you mean, "being asked?"

14:56.272 --> 14:58.565
This didn't come from Domenic?

14:58.648 --> 15:00.692
He said Dom and his father
don't wanna do it.

15:00.775 --> 15:02.612
So, who's telling them?

15:02.695 --> 15:04.363
Teresa and Christian?

15:04.447 --> 15:05.863
Yeah.

15:05.948 --> 15:07.407
So they're giving the orders now?

15:07.490 --> 15:09.242
I think so. I don't know. Maybe.

15:09.327 --> 15:11.787
- What else did Nats say?
- Nothing. That was it.

15:11.870 --> 15:14.080
I tried to get more,
but he didn't wanna talk about.

15:14.163 --> 15:16.042
Look, he doesn't wanna do it, alright?

15:16.125 --> 15:17.835
He is totally against this.

15:18.418 --> 15:19.920
This is good work, Val.

15:21.255 --> 15:22.297
But I need more.

15:22.380 --> 15:25.133
Get it out of him.
Act curious, ask about the twins,

15:25.217 --> 15:27.593
what they wanna do, where they are,
what their plans are.

15:27.678 --> 15:29.430
I know how to ask a f...

15:29.513 --> 15:32.098
I know how to ask a question, alright?
That's all I got for you.

15:33.183 --> 15:34.685
Well, this is good.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.187
I'm proud of you.

15:37.270 --> 15:39.105
There's just one more thing.

15:43.693 --> 15:45.862
For Adamo. I know his birthday is coming,

15:45.945 --> 15:48.240
and it was my favourite growing up.

15:54.287 --> 15:55.830
Are you sick?

15:57.708 --> 15:59.335
What, do you think we're friends?

16:00.543 --> 16:03.213
Honey, I wouldn't let my son
take a dump on that book

16:03.297 --> 16:05.132
if it came from you.

16:13.807 --> 16:17.310
You know,
he's never gonna forgive himself.

16:17.393 --> 16:18.895
Oh, give him a beat.

16:18.978 --> 16:21.440
Relax, alright?
He just, he needs to calm down.

16:21.523 --> 16:25.027
Yeah. You'd calm down
if someone kidnapped Luca?

16:25.110 --> 16:28.197
Enzo, he pulled a gun on 'em.

16:28.280 --> 16:29.490
He was hot.

16:30.698 --> 16:32.658
It was... It was a mistake.

16:32.743 --> 16:35.453
I know, he crossed a line.
There's blood in the water.

17:09.863 --> 17:11.198
Um, here.

17:11.281 --> 17:12.950
Yeah, that's good.

17:17.078 --> 17:18.247
Oh.

17:20.165 --> 17:23.042
This, my friend, is a very good baby.

17:23.127 --> 17:25.377
- Can I use the washroom? OK.
- Yeah.

17:33.553 --> 17:34.805
Hi.

17:36.723 --> 17:38.267
Hey, hey.

17:43.772 --> 17:45.398
It's gonna be OK.

17:45.482 --> 17:47.025
Yeah.

18:33.655 --> 18:35.365
- Declan.
- <i>Do we have a deal?</i>

18:35.448 --> 18:36.575
I wanna see him.

18:39.202 --> 18:42.413
Nats, focus. Do we have a deal?

18:42.497 --> 18:44.207
I wanna see my son.

18:45.875 --> 18:47.168
Put it on speakerphone.

18:49.547 --> 18:51.965
<i>See, he's doing just fine.</i>

18:53.175 --> 18:54.425
<i>Listen to me.</i>

18:54.510 --> 18:56.220
<i>In three hours,</i>

18:56.303 --> 18:57.847
<i>I'll pick up Reggie and the money</i>

18:57.930 --> 19:00.265
at the location I just texted you.
Do you see it?

19:00.348 --> 19:02.893
Now, if I see one cop

19:02.977 --> 19:04.812
or any of your men,

19:04.895 --> 19:06.188
if I get a whiff of an ambush,

19:06.272 --> 19:09.692
if I so much as think
the colour of the sky is wrong,

19:09.775 --> 19:13.362
<i>your baby is gone, am I clear?</i>

19:14.237 --> 19:15.322
Yes.

19:15.905 --> 19:17.365
<i>Once I have Reggie and the money,</i>

19:17.448 --> 19:19.702
<i>I'll tell you where you can get your son.</i>

19:19.785 --> 19:22.537
He's just a baby.
You can't leave him some place, OK?

19:22.620 --> 19:24.288
He'll be safe, Nats.

19:24.372 --> 19:26.250
<i>You have to trust me.</i>

19:26.333 --> 19:28.335
We don't agree to your conditions.

19:28.418 --> 19:30.337
What the hell did you just do?

19:30.420 --> 19:32.547
This is not going to work your way.

19:34.382 --> 19:37.510
If you answer that,
I will never tell you where the nephew is.

19:37.593 --> 19:41.223
We will call him in one hour,
make him wait.

19:41.890 --> 19:45.185
We are not just going to give him
everything he wants.

19:45.268 --> 19:46.978
You could've just killed my grandson.

19:47.062 --> 19:49.230
Declan needs something. This isn't over.

19:49.313 --> 19:51.107
It's not your call to make.

19:51.190 --> 19:53.110
It's exactly our call to make.

19:53.193 --> 19:54.737
You must be crazy

19:54.820 --> 19:57.738
if you think I'm gonna let you
decide the fate of my grandson!

19:57.822 --> 19:59.992
We told you to find Declan,
and you haven't!

20:00.075 --> 20:01.577
So we did something.

20:01.660 --> 20:03.495
Now, if you let us do this our way,

20:03.578 --> 20:05.663
I guarantee you would have your son,

20:05.747 --> 20:08.500
you would have your money,
and we would be rid of this man!

20:11.878 --> 20:14.005
This is a process.

20:15.173 --> 20:18.135
And right now,
everyone needs a little break.

20:19.637 --> 20:21.638
To calm down and clear their minds.

20:22.597 --> 20:25.350
Calm down and clear my mind?
Are you crazy?

20:25.433 --> 20:26.893
- Nats!
- Clear my mind?

20:26.977 --> 20:29.062
- Come on. Come on.
- Nats, let's go outside.

20:29.145 --> 20:30.313
Hey, hey. Let's go outside.

20:30.397 --> 20:31.523
Come on.

20:36.820 --> 20:38.488
Just got him changed.

20:39.782 --> 20:41.367
They agree to it?

21:16.360 --> 21:17.735
Hey.

21:17.818 --> 21:18.862
Who's this?

21:18.945 --> 21:20.322
That's Shelley.

21:20.405 --> 21:21.907
- Is this your baby?
- Uh, no.

21:21.990 --> 21:23.533
Is this your baby?

21:23.617 --> 21:25.535
We'll be out of here soon, OK?

21:25.618 --> 21:27.912
Why aren't you answering
a very easy question?

21:27.997 --> 21:29.288
Should I leave you alone?

21:29.372 --> 21:30.957
- Oh no.
- What the hell is going on?

21:31.040 --> 21:32.583
Rose, let's take it outside.

21:32.667 --> 21:35.462
- I don't wanna disturb this.
- I can't believe you brought someone.

21:35.545 --> 21:37.172
I know. I'll tell you.

21:40.008 --> 21:41.427
Hey, hey.

21:43.095 --> 21:45.638
The Italians, they kidnapped
my nephew, Reggie.

21:45.722 --> 21:47.140
Whose baby is that?

21:47.223 --> 21:48.725
Nats Cosoleto.

21:49.977 --> 21:52.103
- Nats Cosoleto?
- I know, I know, I know...

21:52.187 --> 21:54.355
Shit, Declan.
This is not what I signed up for.

21:54.438 --> 21:56.692
You gotta leave, and you gotta
take that baby with you.

21:56.775 --> 21:58.485
- Soon. Can't.
- Now.

21:58.568 --> 22:01.738
"Can't" is what people say
when someone suggests kidnapping a baby.

22:01.822 --> 22:03.407
"Sorry, I can't do that."

22:03.490 --> 22:05.825
Hey, look at that. It's my nephew.

22:05.908 --> 22:07.452
He's completely innocent.

22:07.535 --> 22:09.913
They're holding him somewhere.
They're torturing him.

22:09.997 --> 22:11.163
I had to do something.

22:11.873 --> 22:13.417
- What do they want?
- They want me.

22:16.628 --> 22:18.963
This is not what I signed up for.

22:19.047 --> 22:21.090
I know. I know.

22:22.842 --> 22:24.887
OK, truth be told,

22:24.970 --> 22:26.763
I'm not gonna harm that baby.

22:26.847 --> 22:28.932
If they call my bluff, I lose.

22:31.017 --> 22:33.853
I had to do something, Rose.
I, I had to stop it.

22:34.980 --> 22:36.815
I had nowhere else safe to go.

22:36.898 --> 22:38.983
It's a shitty position
to put you in, I know.

22:39.067 --> 22:40.318
Yeah, it is.

22:41.277 --> 22:42.695
What would you have done?

22:43.655 --> 22:47.533
Tell me, what would you have done
if someone kidnapped Bobby or Twix or Wes?

22:50.662 --> 22:52.080
It's gonna be OK.

22:52.955 --> 22:54.750
I'm gonna get Reggie back.

22:54.833 --> 22:56.752
I'm gonna get it all back.

22:59.503 --> 23:01.673
We should just kill Reggie
and be done with it.

23:01.757 --> 23:03.717
If we do that, we lose them completely.

23:05.427 --> 23:07.637
It's not like you to be so compromising.

23:09.097 --> 23:10.807
We have a lot to get done here.

23:10.890 --> 23:12.725
We can replace them later, not now.

23:14.185 --> 23:15.478
They're unreliable.

23:15.562 --> 23:17.230
They're predictable.

23:18.148 --> 23:20.608
Declan knew exactly what to do.

23:20.692 --> 23:22.610
He didn't kidnap Nats or Luca.

23:22.693 --> 23:24.528
He took a baby.

23:25.822 --> 23:27.823
Everyone goes soft for a baby.

23:34.455 --> 23:37.208
Here, the church.

23:37.292 --> 23:39.710
Good. Get some men over there.

23:39.795 --> 23:40.920
Got it.

23:41.003 --> 23:42.797
Declan is finished.

23:47.260 --> 23:48.553
Hey, babe.

23:53.475 --> 23:55.060
Nats?

24:01.942 --> 24:03.527
I don't trust them.

24:04.443 --> 24:06.530
They don't give a damn about us.

24:06.613 --> 24:08.198
They don't give a damn about Adamo.

24:09.073 --> 24:10.742
- I'm calling.
- No.

24:10.825 --> 24:13.370
- I'm calling Declan.
- Don't. Don't. Don't.

24:13.453 --> 24:15.497
Give me my phone.

24:16.330 --> 24:18.167
It's Val.

24:20.002 --> 24:21.962
What do I tell her?

24:22.045 --> 24:24.255
Don't answer it.
You wait until we know something.

24:24.338 --> 24:26.508
I gotta tell Val. It's been hours.

24:26.592 --> 24:27.842
It's been hours.

24:27.925 --> 24:30.720
We have no deal, no plan. We got no clue.

24:32.222 --> 24:34.765
If she finds out now,
she's gonna completely lose her shit,

24:34.850 --> 24:36.100
so I'm keeping this.

24:36.183 --> 24:38.060
Here. Smoke.

24:41.773 --> 24:42.940
Breathe.

24:43.023 --> 24:44.692
- Yeah.
- Breathe.

24:48.488 --> 24:52.158
It sounds crass
cos we're talking about Adamo, OK?

24:55.245 --> 24:58.080
But it is a negotiation, OK,

24:58.163 --> 25:01.208
and not only between us and Declan,
but between us and them.

25:03.628 --> 25:04.795
Look...

25:07.757 --> 25:09.300
I swear to you,

25:09.383 --> 25:11.762
I'll put a bullet in their heads
if that boy gets hurt.

25:13.930 --> 25:15.182
He took him.

25:16.933 --> 25:18.727
He took him right in front of me.

25:19.602 --> 25:21.938
I watched him walk out
the door holding him.

25:23.357 --> 25:25.275
It's the first time in his life
I'm worried.

25:26.067 --> 25:27.693
You don't think...

25:27.777 --> 25:30.530
You don't think Declan
would hurt him or nothing, eh?

25:30.613 --> 25:33.325
- No, we're gonna get him back.
- He won't hurt him or nothing, eh?

25:33.408 --> 25:36.077
We're gonna get him back, OK?
I promise you.

25:36.160 --> 25:38.497
Everything's gonna be fine, OK?

25:39.413 --> 25:41.332
OK? Everything's gonna be fine.

25:42.750 --> 25:44.543
OK. OK.

25:45.503 --> 25:47.005
Everything's gonna be fine, OK?

25:47.088 --> 25:49.048
I'm gonna kill him.

25:53.803 --> 25:55.638
I'm gonna kill him.

25:56.848 --> 25:58.600
Yeah, I'm gonna kill him.

25:58.683 --> 26:00.352
Hey, hey, hey...

26:00.435 --> 26:02.520
I'm gonna kill him.

26:12.322 --> 26:13.948
Do you think he's hungry?

26:14.032 --> 26:17.160
He's OK. Maybe take him outside
and get some fresh air.

26:17.243 --> 26:18.412
It's a little cool.

26:18.495 --> 26:20.205
I have a kid's blanket at the house.

26:20.288 --> 26:21.623
Is it wool though? Is it itchy?

26:21.707 --> 26:23.542
No, fine. You guys are cute.

26:24.750 --> 26:26.753
It's like a sitcom in here somewhere,

26:26.837 --> 26:28.713
you know, two gangsters and a baby.

26:32.883 --> 26:34.218
Yeah?

26:34.302 --> 26:36.178
We are going to do the exchange

26:36.262 --> 26:38.390
face to face in public.

26:38.473 --> 26:41.225
You bring the child.
We bring your nephew and the money.

26:41.935 --> 26:43.395
Fair for you, fair for us.

26:43.478 --> 26:45.022
- Where?
<i>- A church.</i>

26:45.105 --> 26:47.732
There will be enough civilians
to keep everybody calm,

26:47.815 --> 26:50.277
and the eyes of God to keep you honest.

26:50.360 --> 26:52.987
<i>I want Domenic to bring Reggie
and the money alone.</i>

26:53.070 --> 26:55.240
<i>If I see anyone else, the deal is off.</i>

26:55.323 --> 26:58.410
The family has made it clear
that they want this matter settled.

26:58.493 --> 27:01.620
But it will not be Domenic.
It will be Nats.

27:02.413 --> 27:03.998
It is his son after all.

27:04.082 --> 27:05.500
<i>Alone.</i>

27:07.168 --> 27:08.670
I'll be alone.

27:08.753 --> 27:12.007
Outside on the steps. Alone, Nats.

27:13.007 --> 27:16.385
No. My son is not gonna do this.

27:16.468 --> 27:18.137
I'm going, Pop.

27:19.388 --> 27:22.475
You know I understand,
but you don't gotta do this.

27:22.558 --> 27:23.643
Not like this.

27:23.727 --> 27:25.937
You said you wanted
to do things his way.

27:26.020 --> 27:27.605
This is his way.

27:27.688 --> 27:30.067
No, you can't do this alone.
I'm going with you.

27:31.025 --> 27:33.152
Everybody stop telling me what to do.

27:34.737 --> 27:37.448
Zio, I'm gonna go get my son back.

27:39.908 --> 27:40.993
OK.

27:43.955 --> 27:45.332
Text me Reggie's location.

27:50.795 --> 27:52.672
I've known Declan a long time.

27:52.755 --> 27:54.673
I'm not going to give you
a dead kitten story,

27:54.757 --> 27:56.760
but he's helped me out a lot.

27:56.843 --> 27:58.887
And I just want you to know
he is a tough mother

27:58.970 --> 28:00.722
but he's got a code.

28:00.805 --> 28:04.433
You know, you do right by him,
and he'll be your cavalry.

28:05.435 --> 28:07.478
Yeah, well,
let's hope he doesn't need it today.

28:08.353 --> 28:10.190
Keys for the truck?

28:10.857 --> 28:12.192
Um...

28:13.275 --> 28:14.735
Here, I'll put the seat in.

28:18.280 --> 28:19.823
I'm sure Nats will play along.

28:19.907 --> 28:21.533
He's not gonna risk his child.

28:22.202 --> 28:24.620
Thanks for everything, Rose.

28:26.622 --> 28:29.250
I look forward to meeting your nephew
when you come back.

28:38.718 --> 28:40.387
<i>- Val.
- Where's Adamo?</i>

28:40.470 --> 28:42.597
<i>Val, just don't say anything.
Let me finish.</i>

28:42.680 --> 28:44.515
<i>Stop talking.
Just tell me where he is!</i>

28:44.598 --> 28:46.558
<i>Someone took him.</i>

28:46.642 --> 28:49.645
<i>He had a gun, and he tied me up,
and he took, he took Adamo.</i>

28:52.190 --> 28:53.357
I'm sorry.

29:00.198 --> 29:02.075
I'll... I can, I can...

29:02.158 --> 29:05.245
You let someone take your son?
What kind of man are you?

29:07.330 --> 29:09.415
- He had a gun, OK?
- Where is he?

29:09.498 --> 29:11.625
It was retribution because the twins

29:11.708 --> 29:13.545
took this guy's nephew.

29:13.628 --> 29:15.380
Who? Who? Who took him?

29:15.463 --> 29:17.298
His name's Declan.
It doesn't matter what...

29:17.382 --> 29:19.508
You hid this from me all day
while I'm here by myself?

29:19.592 --> 29:22.053
No, I had to make arrangements,
but it's taken care of now.

29:22.137 --> 29:23.137
I'm gonna go get him.

29:23.220 --> 29:24.847
Where are you going? Stop.

29:24.930 --> 29:26.307
I'm going to get our son.

29:27.767 --> 29:29.185
Where?

29:30.770 --> 29:32.897
An Anglican church outside of Odessa.

29:33.815 --> 29:34.982
OK, I'm calling the police.

29:35.065 --> 29:36.943
Are you crazy? You're not calling the...

29:37.027 --> 29:38.487
What are you doing?

29:38.570 --> 29:39.987
Why you calling the police, huh?

29:40.070 --> 29:42.865
What are you gonna say to 'em?
"My family kidnapped this guy.

29:42.948 --> 29:44.867
Then they took my son. I need help."

29:45.868 --> 29:47.995
Look, look, look. It's OK. It's OK, OK?

29:48.078 --> 29:50.748
I'm gonna go get him.
I will call you the second I have him.

29:50.832 --> 29:52.833
I promise you. I promise you, OK?

29:52.917 --> 29:54.877
No. Wait. Stop. I'm going with you.

29:54.960 --> 29:57.088
You're not coming with me.
You are not going with me.

29:57.797 --> 30:01.008
OK?
You need to listen to me for once, please.

30:01.092 --> 30:03.762
- He told me to come alone, so I'm going.
- He has my son!

30:06.263 --> 30:08.098
You don't call me all day.

30:08.182 --> 30:11.477
I'm losing my shit,
and you think I'm not gonna go with you?

30:12.353 --> 30:15.063
I'm not just gonna sit here.
I'm going to get my son.

30:17.900 --> 30:19.318
I'll wait for you in the car.

30:42.467 --> 30:43.802
- Hey.
<i>- </i> I have 30 seconds.

30:43.885 --> 30:45.762
You gotta help me.
My son's been kidnapped.

30:45.845 --> 30:47.013
What?

30:47.097 --> 30:48.682
This guy Declan took my son

30:48.765 --> 30:50.725
cos those twins
kidnapped someone from him.

30:50.808 --> 30:53.435
We're making the exchange
at some Anglican church in Odessa.

30:55.563 --> 30:57.148
- Who you talking to?
- My mother.

30:57.232 --> 30:59.275
Got her all worried
cos I couldn't reach you,

30:59.358 --> 31:01.235
so I called to tell her
everything's fine now.

31:01.318 --> 31:03.237
No, nothing's fine.

31:09.535 --> 31:11.620
What's going on?

31:11.703 --> 31:14.207
Val just called.
Declan kidnapped their son.

31:14.290 --> 31:16.960
She and Nats are on their way
to an exchange.

31:17.043 --> 31:18.670
Whoa. Why?

31:18.753 --> 31:21.588
She only had a few seconds to talk.

31:21.672 --> 31:23.758
I think the twins
took someone from Declan.

31:23.842 --> 31:26.802
She said they're doing the exchange
at an Anglican Church in Odessa.

31:26.885 --> 31:28.888
Call local PD, get them over there.

31:59.835 --> 32:01.295
Hi.

32:16.978 --> 32:18.312
<i>Yeah?</i>

32:18.395 --> 32:19.688
This is a no-go.

32:19.772 --> 32:22.275
I see at least three different cars.
Two cops, one not.

32:22.358 --> 32:23.652
Thanks, Shelley.

32:23.735 --> 32:25.778
<i>Sorry, I gotta get off the train here.</i>

32:25.862 --> 32:27.702
Have to think about my family
at this juncture.

32:27.738 --> 32:29.990
You did more than enough. See ya.

32:52.180 --> 32:54.140
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

32:55.015 --> 32:57.268
Declan takes our son
for a piece of shit like you?

32:57.352 --> 32:59.603
In what universe
is that a fair trade, huh?

32:59.687 --> 33:01.355
- It isn't.
- Not even close.

33:01.438 --> 33:03.148
- I completely agree...
- Shut up. Shut up.

33:03.232 --> 33:04.233
OK.

33:06.152 --> 33:07.695
<i>Yeah, hello?</i>

33:07.778 --> 33:09.905
Hey, Nats. You on the road?

33:09.988 --> 33:10.990
<i>Yeah.</i>

33:11.073 --> 33:12.283
I wanna talk to Reggie.

33:12.367 --> 33:13.952
You're on speaker.

33:15.035 --> 33:16.245
Hey.

33:16.328 --> 33:18.247
Hey. You OK?

33:18.330 --> 33:19.998
I, I've been worse...

33:20.082 --> 33:21.458
<i>Do you have the cartel's money?</i>

33:22.543 --> 33:23.878
It's beside me, yeah.

33:23.962 --> 33:26.463
<i>Reggie, I want you to look out the window
right now.</i>

33:26.547 --> 33:28.842
Try and find a road sign
so I know where you are.

33:28.925 --> 33:30.342
<i>Anyone else in the car with you?</i>

33:30.427 --> 33:32.010
Yeah, his wife.

33:33.512 --> 33:36.723
Nats, Nats. I told you to go alone.

33:36.807 --> 33:39.435
I'm his mother.
You think I'm not gonna get my child?

33:39.518 --> 33:41.020
- Val.
- I tell you what,

33:41.103 --> 33:42.938
if you hurt him, if you touch my boy,

33:43.022 --> 33:44.315
I am gonna rip your heart out.

33:44.398 --> 33:46.442
Mrs. Cosoleto, I can appreciate that.

33:46.525 --> 33:48.027
Nats, I won't hold that against you.

33:48.110 --> 33:49.230
<i>- Go to hell.</i>
- Are you done?

33:49.278 --> 33:51.197
I'll be done when I get my boy back.

33:52.657 --> 33:56.285
We're on Highway two,
and we just passed Exit 43.

34:01.040 --> 34:04.043
OK, Nats, take the next exit. Get off.

34:04.127 --> 34:06.545
No, we make the exchange face to face.

34:06.628 --> 34:08.757
- That was the deal.
- <i>It still is.</i>

34:08.840 --> 34:10.297
How do we know you have him?

34:10.382 --> 34:12.552
Oh, I have him. He's just fine.

34:12.635 --> 34:14.303
<i>He's with an animal, he's not fine.</i>

34:15.972 --> 34:17.764
Look at your phone. I just sent you a pic.

34:19.391 --> 34:22.395
<i>See, he's fine.
You're gonna get him back soon.</i>

34:22.478 --> 34:25.648
Adamo, Mama's coming.
Papa's coming, honey, OK?

34:25.732 --> 34:28.400
OK. OK, we're getting off the highway now.

34:29.860 --> 34:31.945
OK, Reggie, look out the rear window.

34:32.027 --> 34:33.487
How many cars do you see?

34:33.572 --> 34:35.407
Declan, no one is following me.

34:35.492 --> 34:36.992
Three cars.

34:37.074 --> 34:39.078
OK, keep watching, see if they follow.

34:39.161 --> 34:40.580
<i>OK.</i>

34:40.663 --> 34:43.415
Nats, turn left.
You should be on Lewis Street.

34:46.585 --> 34:48.087
Reggie, anything?

34:48.170 --> 34:50.380
<i>There's two cars now,
a red one and a black one.</i>

34:51.340 --> 34:52.842
Turn left again, Nats.

35:02.185 --> 35:03.227
Reg?

35:03.310 --> 35:04.687
<i>The black one is still there.</i>

35:05.270 --> 35:06.730
Pull over, Nats.

35:06.813 --> 35:08.773
Declan, this is ridiculous. We came alone.

35:08.858 --> 35:11.360
We didn't do anything.
We did whatever you said to do.

35:11.443 --> 35:13.320
That would be a lie. Pull over.

35:22.163 --> 35:23.580
Who is that?

35:23.663 --> 35:25.708
Declan, he stopped.

35:25.792 --> 35:29.670
Declan, I, I got no idea who that is.
I promise you we came alone.

35:29.753 --> 35:31.630
Say goodbye, Nats.
Say goodbye to your boy.

35:31.713 --> 35:33.048
No, wait. Wait. No.

35:33.132 --> 35:35.677
Please, I don't know who that is!
You gotta believe me!

35:36.385 --> 35:37.595
You broke our agreement.

35:37.678 --> 35:38.972
- No, he didn't!
- Wait! Wait!

35:39.055 --> 35:40.765
I'll get him to go!
I'll get him to go, OK?

35:40.848 --> 35:42.225
I don't know who that is.

35:42.308 --> 35:43.725
<i>I'll get him to go.</i>

35:43.808 --> 35:45.812
<i>Declan.</i>

35:45.895 --> 35:47.272
What?

35:47.355 --> 35:48.730
I believe him.

35:50.858 --> 35:53.777
<i>Alright, Nats. Get out of your car.</i>

35:53.862 --> 35:56.113
<i>Go back and tell that car to turn around.</i>

35:56.197 --> 35:57.948
Yeah, OK. OK.

35:58.032 --> 36:00.367
Don't hang up, OK? Don't hang up.

36:20.972 --> 36:22.848
Hey! What are you doing here?

36:22.932 --> 36:24.683
You think I was gonna
let you do this alone?

36:24.767 --> 36:27.687
He knows you're following us.
Reggie's on the phone with him,

36:27.770 --> 36:30.522
- telling him everything.
- I'll lay further back. He won't see me.

36:30.607 --> 36:32.775
If you don't go,
I don't know what he'll do to Adamo.

36:32.858 --> 36:34.110
You gotta turn around.

36:34.193 --> 36:36.653
I know you wanna help,
but you gotta turn around right now.

36:36.737 --> 36:38.572
You don't know
what's waiting for you there.

36:38.655 --> 36:40.867
Listen to me. Turn around right now.

36:40.950 --> 36:42.243
Get this through your head.

36:42.327 --> 36:44.412
He will not give me Adamo
if I'm not alone!

37:05.725 --> 37:07.310
Declan, it was my cousin, Luca.

37:07.393 --> 37:09.895
I promise you I didn't say nothing to him,
and he's gone now.

37:09.978 --> 37:12.105
- Reggie?
- <i>Yeah, he's taking off.</i>

37:12.188 --> 37:14.067
OK, Nats.

37:14.150 --> 37:15.483
Start your car.

37:15.567 --> 37:18.028
Go straight ahead.
Turn right at the next street.

37:18.112 --> 37:20.072
That'll be Brookdale Avenue.
You stay on that.

37:20.155 --> 37:22.367
It's gonna seem like forever,
but you're almost there.

37:22.450 --> 37:24.785
Wait, why aren't we going to the church?

37:24.868 --> 37:27.037
<i>Because those freak twins
sent people there, Nats,</i>

37:27.120 --> 37:30.207
<i>which means they have </i> zero,
<i>zero regard for your beautiful baby boy.</i>

37:30.290 --> 37:32.752
<i>I'm making this safer for us.</i>

37:32.835 --> 37:35.587
Mind the speed limit. I'll call you back.

37:41.927 --> 37:44.097
I'm telling my mum
we're going out for a late dinner,

37:44.180 --> 37:45.682
in case she passes by.

37:50.393 --> 37:52.228
OK, this is where they must be.

37:53.605 --> 37:55.148
Call off the others.

37:55.232 --> 37:57.318
Get local black and whites over there.

37:58.735 --> 37:59.945
OK.

38:08.203 --> 38:09.913
It's almost over.

38:12.458 --> 38:13.500
And then what?

38:14.877 --> 38:17.170
What about the next guy
your family pisses off?

38:18.338 --> 38:20.548
Can we just be a team for, like,
five minutes?

38:20.632 --> 38:23.260
Try and imagine if I had been
the reason Adamo was taken.

38:24.928 --> 38:27.890
You think you'd be talking about team,
then?

38:30.852 --> 38:33.937
- I just wanna tell you I'm sorry...
- Shut up. Shut up.

38:37.107 --> 38:38.983
Yeah?

38:39.068 --> 38:41.278
<i>You're gonna be
coming up to Taylor Street.</i>

38:41.362 --> 38:44.407
<i>Make a right, keep driving,
then turn left onto Daly.</i>

38:48.243 --> 38:49.537
Daly Street.

38:49.620 --> 38:51.455
Is there any other information?

38:51.538 --> 38:53.082
No, that's it.

39:16.105 --> 39:18.315
Big day. You wanna see him?

39:22.360 --> 39:23.653
Adamo. Adamo.

39:23.737 --> 39:25.363
Your mama and your papa are here, buddy.

39:25.447 --> 39:28.658
Get your hands on the wheel.
Nats, don't move 'em.

39:28.742 --> 39:30.787
I know you want to, but don't move 'em.

39:30.870 --> 39:32.872
Reggie, let's go. Bring the money.

39:32.955 --> 39:34.498
Sit by me.

39:37.960 --> 39:39.253
Come on.

39:40.712 --> 39:41.797
Come on.

39:45.050 --> 39:47.470
You tied him up? Gimme your hands.

39:51.057 --> 39:52.767
Open up the bag.

39:52.850 --> 39:54.560
Look through the top of the bills.

39:55.727 --> 39:58.230
See if there's any stuffing
and filling or tracers.

39:58.313 --> 40:00.817
There's nothing in there, Declan.
Let me come get him.

40:01.567 --> 40:03.277
How's it look?

40:03.360 --> 40:04.862
It just looks like money. It's OK.

40:04.945 --> 40:06.447
Come get your boy.

40:06.530 --> 40:07.698
Not you. Her.

40:07.782 --> 40:09.492
No! No! No!

40:09.575 --> 40:10.952
- Val!
- It's fine!

40:15.790 --> 40:18.125
- You think I'm gonna forget this?
- You should.

40:18.208 --> 40:22.003
This was me and you,
fixing their mess, your family.

40:22.087 --> 40:24.005
Bye-bye.

40:43.358 --> 40:44.652
Oh, my God.

40:44.735 --> 40:46.237
Nats.

40:52.868 --> 40:54.578
Come here. Come here.

40:54.662 --> 40:56.163
Come here, come here.

41:02.460 --> 41:04.672
It's OK. It's OK, sweet boy.

41:04.755 --> 41:06.340
It's OK. It's OK.

41:06.423 --> 41:08.175
It's OK.

41:08.258 --> 41:10.385
It's OK. I'm sorry.

41:10.468 --> 41:11.970
I'm so sorry.

41:16.183 --> 41:17.935
They didn't want to listen.
