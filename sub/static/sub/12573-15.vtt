00:03.860 --> 00:09.090
Why have you been unable
to locate the third Box of Orden

00:10.560 --> 00:12.949
or the Wizard Zeddicus?

00:12.950 --> 00:18.179
The tracer cloud our sorcerers sent out
has been unsuccessful in finding either, My Lord.

00:18.180 --> 00:20.239
But we are redoubling our efforts.

00:20.240 --> 00:22.820
The Wizard will not evade us much longer.

00:24.450 --> 00:29.779
Lord Rahl, think of what you've accomplished
even without all three boxes.

00:29.780 --> 00:31.329
You've conquered two territories

00:31.330 --> 00:34.040
and the resistance will soon be crushed.

00:35.210 --> 00:38.920
I don't want to crush them, Egremont.

00:42.260 --> 00:46.510
The Seeker has poisoned the minds of the people

00:46.510 --> 00:49.860
with this misguided notion
that I want to do them harm,

00:50.020 --> 00:53.670
when all I want to do is bring them peace.

00:53.890 --> 00:56.239
At least My Lord can take comfort in the news

00:56.240 --> 00:59.550
that the Seeker no longer stands in our way.

01:05.670 --> 01:07.600
Tell me, Egremont,

01:08.480 --> 01:11.720
do you really believe the Seeker is dead?

01:11.720 --> 01:13.369
<i>You're alive.</i>

01:13.370 --> 01:14.800
Thank the Spirits.

01:14.970 --> 01:16.839
Darken Rahl's messengers have been spreading word

01:16.840 --> 01:18.529
that you abandoned your quest,

01:18.530 --> 01:20.650
fled back across the Boundary, and di there.

01:21.150 --> 01:23.069
We want him to believe that,

01:23.070 --> 01:24.089
so he'll let his guard down, 

01:24.089 --> 01:26.249
stop hunting me,at least for a while.

01:26.250 --> 01:27.659
We knew we could trust you.

01:27.660 --> 01:30.270
Of course. Anything for the Seeker.

01:30.450 --> 01:32.290
We're heading for the Keep of Edraan.

01:32.730 --> 01:34.210
Can you take us there?

01:34.400 --> 01:35.770
The Keep of Edraan?

01:35.960 --> 01:38.599
That's a place most people would do anything to avoid.

01:38.600 --> 01:40.640
We don't have that luxury.

01:42.650 --> 01:44.719
My family was abducted in Hartland,

01:44.720 --> 01:46.450
sent there as prisoners.

01:47.180 --> 01:48.480
I'm sorry to hear that.

01:48.680 --> 01:50.590
They won't be prisoners much longer.

01:55.540 --> 01:57.229
It won't be easy getting in.

01:57.230 --> 02:00.500
It won't be easy for those D'Haran bastards to keep me out.

02:01.050 --> 02:03.629
We could take that patrol, storm this place.

02:03.630 --> 02:04.929
Easy, Chase.

02:04.930 --> 02:05.929
We don't wanna rattle the hive

02:05.930 --> 02:07.930
until we deal with the hornets inside.

02:09.259 --> 02:11.150
What exactly goes on in there?

02:11.500 --> 02:13.978
No one really knows.

02:15.000 --> 02:21.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:30.947 --> 02:35.528
spell

02:47.680 --> 02:50.149
That's why I had you assigned here, Bram.

02:50.150 --> 02:53.659
So you could witness Giller's twist alchemy for yourself

02:53.660 --> 02:57.010
I'd hoped your accounts of what went on here
were exaggerated, Uncle.

02:57.700 --> 02:58.769
But that woman--

02:58.770 --> 03:00.819
That woman was one of the lucky ones.

03:00.820 --> 03:02.370
At least she died.

03:02.680 --> 03:05.169
d the more Rahl pushes Giller for results,

03:05.170 --> 03:08.040
the more sadistic his experiments become.

03:13.090 --> 03:18.560
For too long, I've sat idly by while Rahl has waged his war in the name of peace.

03:18.680 --> 03:20.562
And now I'm supposed to watch as he has his Wizard

03:20.562 --> 03:23.122
butcher defenseless women and children?

03:24.500 --> 03:26.960
Lord Rahl must have his reasons.

03:27.520 --> 03:29.329
If Giller succeeds,

03:29.330 --> 03:33.320
Rahl will no longer need the Boxes of Orden
to control us all.

03:33.480 --> 03:36.560
We'll all be enslaved to his will.

03:37.170 --> 03:38.930
Captain Ericon.

03:43.220 --> 03:47.449
Inform Lord Rahl that we are making progress

03:47.450 --> 03:50.970
despite today's, uh, disappointment.

03:51.400 --> 03:53.260
Yes, Wizard.

03:54.731 --> 03:58.930
We're running out of places to bury Giller's disappointmes.

04:00.610 --> 04:01.870
You're right.

04:02.160 --> 04:03.690
This is madness.

04:03.950 --> 04:06.653
But defying Rahl is just as insane.

04:06.653 --> 04:10.700
If we don't act soon,
defying Rahl will no longer be an option.

04:17.209 --> 04:20.329
Lord Rahl, word from Edraan.

04:31.340 --> 04:34.539
It appears Wizard Giller mighhave more success

04:34.540 --> 04:36.790
if he had the proper motivation.

04:37.390 --> 04:38.920
Send a reply.

04:40.230 --> 04:42.720
My dear Giller...

04:46.920 --> 04:48.149
What is it?

04:48.150 --> 04:51.159
When the Constellation of Pirion aligns,

04:51.160 --> 04:53.810
Lord Rahl will arrive at the Keep.

04:53.910 --> 04:58.640
He's coming to oversee Giller's work personally.

05:02.060 --> 05:03.760
And when he gets here,

05:04.900 --> 05:06.850
we're going to kill him.

05:35.480 --> 05:37.650
Command me, Confessor.

05:38.240 --> 05:41.110
The prisons are kept in a dungeon just below the Keep.

05:41.490 --> 05:43.090
Is my family among them?

05:43.200 --> 05:44.319
Are they all right?

05:44.320 --> 05:45.570
I don't know.

05:45.570 --> 05:47.699
There are many women and children held inside.

05:47.700 --> 05:52.180
The only time I've seen the prisoners
is when their bodies are taken out to be buried.

05:56.230 --> 05:57.609
If anything's happened to them--

05:57.610 --> 06:00.580
They're alive, and we're going to get them out.

06:02.630 --> 06:07.140
Some of my men in the resistance intercepted a shipment
of Dragon's Breath last week.

06:07.170 --> 06:09.009
You think we could blast our way into the Keep?

06:09.010 --> 06:11.850
There's enough to blast it back to D'Hara.

06:11.990 --> 06:13.719
We might end up killing the prisoners.

06:13.720 --> 06:14.579
Then how?

06:14.580 --> 06:16.950
The Keep doesn't even have windows.

06:17.600 --> 06:19.589
Without windows, how is it lit?

06:19.590 --> 06:22.740
Oil lamps fed through pipes from a cistern.

06:23.330 --> 06:26.240
tting off the flow of oil would plunge the Keep into darkness.

06:27.320 --> 06:30.420
Can't stop us freeing the prisoners
if they can't see us doing it.

06:37.140 --> 06:40.250
Some of my men are ready to act. But we need you.

06:40.260 --> 06:42.469
You grew up with Rahl. You're his oldest friend.

06:42.470 --> 06:45.369
The abuses inflicted upon me were not acts of friendship.

06:45.370 --> 06:46.849
Rahl trusts you.

06:46.850 --> 06:49.479
And when he arrives, he'll grant you a private audience.

06:49.480 --> 06:52.289
He clearly has a special place in his heart for you.

06:52.290 --> 06:54.469
- Rahl has no heart. 
- Of course he does.

06:54.470 --> 06:57.479
And when he embraces you, you'll plunge your dagger into it.

06:57.480 --> 06:58.840
That's suicide.

06:59.140 --> 07:01.169
Rahl's guards will be just outside the door.

07:01.170 --> 07:04.439
My men and I will kill the guards while you're inside.

07:04.440 --> 07:05.329
What about Giller?

07:05.330 --> 07:06.519
We'll kill the Wizard,

07:06.520 --> 07:08.039
blame him for the assassination.

07:08.040 --> 07:09.959
No one will question it.

07:09.960 --> 07:13.170
Remember, Giller once swore allegiance to thConfessors.

07:31.920 --> 07:34.750
And now.

07:37.570 --> 07:39.460
Keep the entrance cored.

07:47.440 --> 07:49.360
Think of your son.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.729
When he comes of age,

07:51.730 --> 07:53.849
he will be conscripted.

07:53.850 --> 07:57.920
Are you willing to sacrifice him 
for this pointless, brutal war?

08:00.850 --> 08:04.300
No, I'm not.

08:06.570 --> 08:08.320
I'm with you, Uncle.

08:31.270 --> 08:33.600
Emma? Laa?

08:33.940 --> 08:35.220
Who's there?

08:42.200 --> 08:44.359
Oh, thank the Spirits, I've found you.

08:44.360 --> 08:47.620
Chase? I don't believe it.

08:47.690 --> 08:49.050
ther.

08:53.290 --> 08:56.039
We're going to get you out of here. All of you.

08:56.040 --> 08:58.940
But you have to follow our footsteps and stay very quiet.

09:00.070 --> 09:02.260
<i>I want that leak repaired.</i>

09:05.010 --> 09:07.650
We're trying to relight the lamps.

09:07.750 --> 09:09.330
Check the dungeon.

09:16.610 --> 09:18.500
They've gone. All of them.

09:20.610 --> 09:23.612
Rahl arrive tomorrow,

09:25.181 --> 09:27.707
I can try to delay his visit,

09:27.780 --> 09:29.299
but if we have nothing to show him,

09:29.300 --> 09:32.370
our blood will be used as ink for his Journey Book.

09:32.370 --> 09:34.340
The prisers can't veone far.

09:36.210 --> 09:37.840
Then find them.

09:46.950 --> 09:48.740
We can rest here for a moment.

09:49.170 --> 09:52.050
Oh. I missed you all so much.

09:53.280 --> 09:56.170
Every day I prayed to see you again.

10:16.590 --> 10:19.420
I was afraid I'd never see you again.

10:20.010 --> 10:22.930
Nothing could stop me from finding you.

10:40.300 --> 10:41.680
Chase?

10:42.460 --> 10:43.960
Chase!

10:45.450 --> 10:46.209
Chase?

10:46.210 --> 10:47.959
Father, what's wrong?

10:47.960 --> 10:49.049
Chase?

10:49.050 --> 10:51.320
Chase?

10:54.060 --> 10:55.990
His heartbeat's weak.

10:57.350 --> 10:58.890
And he's burning up.

10:59.400 --> 11:00.860
But he's still alive.

11:01.980 --> 11:03.910
It's the Wizard's doing.

11:04.470 --> 11:08.909
He performed dark magic on my mother
and many of the others.

11:08.910 --> 11:11.100
Did I do this to Chase?

11:11.850 --> 11:13.120
I don't know.

11:14.170 --> 11:16.300
All I did was kiss him.

11:16.670 --> 11:18.379
This Wizard, do you know his name?

11:18.380 --> 11:19.880
They call him Giller.

11:22.600 --> 11:24.170
You've heard of him?

11:24.230 --> 11:25.619
He used to serve the Confessors,

11:25.620 --> 11:27.900
until he sold his services to Rahl.

11:27.970 --> 11:30.080
Emma, what did he do to you?

11:39.200 --> 11:40.800
Kahlan, what is that?

11:40.810 --> 11:43.450
Some kind of magic. I've never seen it before.

11:46.530 --> 11:47.980
Oh, please.

11:48.220 --> 11:50.619
You've got to help my husband.

11:50.620 --> 11:54.730
There's a healer half a day's ride to the east.

11:54.750 --> 11:57.509
That's heading right back towards the D'Harans.

11:57.510 --> 11:59.060
We have to risk it.

12:01.100 --> 12:03.130
Chase could die without help.

12:21.070 --> 12:22.849
Track close to the river.

12:22.850 --> 12:25.410
The prisoners will need a water source.

12:31.020 --> 12:32.859
If you're opposed to Giller's experiments,

12:32.860 --> 12:35.340
shouldn't we let the prisoners remain free?

12:35.580 --> 12:37.099
Without those prisoners,

12:37.100 --> 12:40.090
Rahl will have no reason to journey to Edraan.

12:40.500 --> 12:43.410
Our plan depends on their recapture.

12:48.350 --> 12:50.350
Maybe you shouldn't touch him...

12:52.860 --> 12:56.329
at least until we know exactly what Giller did to you.

12:56.330 --> 12:59.939
I prayed to the Spirits every day
that I'd see Cse again

12:59.940 --> 13:02.590
and now I can't even comfort him?

13:02.750 --> 13:05.230
i know how hard this is,emma

13:06.810 --> 13:09.000
Is there anything we can do?

13:10.740 --> 13:14.059
Hopefully this healer will be able to help Cse.

13:14.060 --> 13:16.960
And will he be able to do anything for me?

13:18.030 --> 13:20.379
Will be able to hold the man that I love again?

13:20.380 --> 13:22.590
To kiss him again?

13:25.450 --> 13:27.690
- Stop. 
- What is it?

13:28.490 --> 13:29.920
We're not alone.

13:31.250 --> 13:32.449
Are you sure?

13:32.450 --> 13:34.869
Yeah. Get them out of here.

13:34.870 --> 13:36.450
The D'Harans are close.

13:48.920 --> 13:50.870
Get them!

14:07.960 --> 14:10.060
No!

14:22.620 --> 14:24.090
The Seeker.

14:24.300 --> 14:25.920
We're on your side!

14:34.110 --> 14:35.475
You fools. 

14:35.676 --> 14:39.265
You just killed the man
who was gonna kill Darken Rahl.

14:42.090 --> 14:45.589
<i>Lord Rahl, we've received word from the Wizard Giller.</i>

14:45.590 --> 14:48.539
He wishes you to delay your journey to the Keep.

14:48.540 --> 14:49.960
He would like more time.

14:50.280 --> 14:52.140
He's had enough time.

14:53.690 --> 14:56.540
Tell him I'll be arriving as planned.

14:58.090 --> 14:59.989
<i>Rahl's coming here?</i>

14:59.990 --> 15:01.140
Tonight.

15:01.140 --> 15:03.739
When the Constellation of Pirion reaches full alignment,

15:03.740 --> 15:05.509
Rahl will arrive at the Keep.

15:05.510 --> 15:10.270
with a dagger to his che.

15:10.620 --> 15:12.950
I believe he's telling the truth.

15:14.010 --> 15:16.479
What's so important that would cause Rahl to come?

15:16.480 --> 15:18.879
Rahl thinks Giller is on the verge of succeeding.

15:18.880 --> 15:20.009
At what?

15:20.010 --> 15:21.760
Making a Confessor.

15:23.760 --> 15:25.960
That's what he was trying to do with Emma.

15:26.320 --> 15:28.589
A Confessor's power comes fr love.

15:28.590 --> 15:31.419
When Emma kissed Chase, she unleashed it.

15:31.420 --> 15:33.949
But she didn't Confess Chase. She nearly killed him.

15:33.950 --> 15:38.670
Giller hasn't succeeded in creating a Confessor, only aberrations.

15:38.870 --> 15:40.300
How is that possible?

15:40.330 --> 15:45.400
Giller's uncovered the ancient magic
that was used to create the first Confessor.

15:45.520 --> 15:47.080
The Shurkia?

15:47.260 --> 15:48.490
Yes.

15:49.930 --> 15:53.739
The Shurkia are magical tools of immense power.

15:53.740 --> 15:56.189
Rahl has grown increasingly impatient.

15:56.190 --> 15:58.109
If he cannot have the three Boxes of Orden,

15:58.110 --> 16:00.309
he wants the power of a Confessor.

16:00.310 --> 16:02.559
And now that Giller has the Shurkia,

16:02.560 --> 16:04.629
Rahl will soon have that power.

16:04.630 --> 16:07.849
He'll be able to bend anyone to his will with a single touch.

16:07.850 --> 16:10.340
And his dominion over this world will be complete.

16:11.970 --> 16:14.519
No, because when Rahl arrives,

16:14.520 --> 16:15.990
I'll be waiting for him.

16:21.410 --> 16:23.360
You can get me inside the Keep.

16:23.460 --> 16:24.750
And I'll kill him.

16:26.240 --> 16:28.390
And you would fulfillthe Prophec

16:28.480 --> 16:30.969
You won't be able to get near him. He's too well-guarded.

16:30.970 --> 16:35.480
The one man who could have gotten close enough to kill him
was my nephew.

16:35.720 --> 16:38.120
And our best chance died with him.

16:41.040 --> 16:43.610
Maybe we don't have to get close to Rahl toill him.

16:45.590 --> 16:49.349
Devlin said the resistance had captured some Dragon's Breath.

16:49.350 --> 16:50.909
Enough tbring down the Keep.

16:50.910 --> 16:53.860
You two can smuggle the Dragon's Breath inside.

16:54.100 --> 16:55.749
And once Rahl arve

16:55.750 --> 16:57.440
we destroy the Keep

16:57.470 --> 17:01.900
along with Rahl,iller and the magic used to create the Confessors.

17:02.420 --> 17:04.349
We need Giller alive.

17:05.069 --> 17:08.529
If he used the Shurkia to put magic into Emma,

17:08.530 --> 17:10.750
he might be the only one who can take it out.

17:11.170 --> 17:12.909
Well, if we can get you inside,

17:12.910 --> 17:14.990
close enough to Confess Giller,

17:15.030 --> 17:17.669
then we can get him out before we turn the Keep into rubble.

17:17.670 --> 17:19.329
There's only one problem:

17:19.430 --> 17:23.390
Giller ordered me not to return without the escaped prisoners.

17:23.569 --> 17:25.108
If Giller wants prisoners,

17:25.109 --> 17:27.150
we'll just have to give him some.

17:40.180 --> 17:42.509
Now, while we're gone,

17:42.510 --> 17:45.840
Devlin will try to find a healer
and come back for Chase.

17:46.080 --> 17:47.590
I'm coming with you.

17:47.680 --> 17:50.389
One prisoner won't fool Giller.

17:50.390 --> 17:52.770
You need a prisoner that he knows.

17:53.398 --> 17:54.750
I'm coming too.

17:55.430 --> 17:59.380
No. You can't go back there.

17:59.470 --> 18:01.090
We have to.

18:03.040 --> 18:04.880
It's the only way.

18:04.970 --> 18:09.820
Richard, y can't trust that D'Haran
with the lives of my family.

18:13.390 --> 18:15.609
Kahlanill be there protect them.

18:15.609 --> 18:17.400
Richard, please.

18:19.630 --> 18:23.070
You risked everything to save this family.

18:24.730 --> 18:26.650
Now it's our turn.

18:31.460 --> 18:32.840
<i>Wizard,</i>

18:32.840 --> 18:34.790
I've brought you your prisoners.

18:37.260 --> 18:39.029
Where are the rest of them?

18:39.030 --> 18:40.429
They scattered like rats.

18:40.430 --> 18:42.090
But my men will find them.

18:44.680 --> 18:46.250
I don't remember this one.

18:49.160 --> 18:50.650
What's your name?

19:05.110 --> 19:09.430
Your powers n't work on me, Confessor.

19:12.510 --> 19:14.460
Wizard, are you all right?

19:15.510 --> 19:16.669
Take him.

19:16.670 --> 19:17.990
I'm sorry.

19:18.020 --> 19:19.929
I didn't know she was a Confessor.

19:19.930 --> 19:22.250
She must have infiltrated the prisoners.

19:22.660 --> 19:24.380
Or she Conssed you.

19:24.600 --> 19:26.299
If I were Confessed,

19:26.300 --> 19:29.190
I'd be defending her life right now.

19:35.930 --> 19:40.040
Your incompetence has provided me
with an unexpected opportunity.

19:40.340 --> 19:41.289
With a living Confessor,

19:41.290 --> 19:43.829
there will be no more failed experiments.

19:43.830 --> 19:47.530
I can finally give Lord Rahl what he truly wants.

20:16.200 --> 20:18.220
You're only gonna hurt yourself.

20:19.660 --> 20:21.949
I couldn't have my creations turning against me,

20:21.950 --> 20:27.900
so, uh, I devised an elixir to protect me from the Confessor's touch.

20:28.280 --> 20:29.659
That's impossible.

20:29.660 --> 20:31.630
Not with the Shurkia.

20:32.490 --> 20:35.290
We'd assumed they'd been lost forever, but...

20:35.550 --> 20:39.359
The shepherd boy chased of one his flock
into the caves of Caddock

20:39.360 --> 20:41.525
and uncovered the secret resting place

20:41.525 --> 20:44.296
of the greatest tools in all of alchemy.

20:45.740 --> 20:48.940
When word reached me of this incredible find, I--

20:49.500 --> 20:51.640
I had to have them for myself.

20:54.600 --> 20:56.230
And with the Shurkia,

20:56.620 --> 21:00.010
I've been able to combine magic in ways I never imagined.

21:00.410 --> 21:03.539
To do things not done for 3000 years.

21:03.540 --> 21:05.400
Wondrous things.

21:06.510 --> 21:09.570
Like creating a protection from your Confessor power.

21:09.790 --> 21:12.119
A power I'll soon be able to harness.

21:12.120 --> 21:16.360
And then, at last, Confessors will be just a memory.

21:17.970 --> 21:22.180
that you don't understand.

21:22.560 --> 21:24.710
I've seen your creations.

21:25.250 --> 21:27.749
Prisoners infected with dark magic.

21:27.750 --> 21:29.570
That will soon change.

21:29.800 --> 21:31.349
Thanks to those D'Haran butchers,

21:31.350 --> 21:34.629
I've only been able study the bodies of dead Confessors.

21:34.630 --> 21:39.900
But now, I can use the Shurkia to harvest your powers

21:40.200 --> 21:43.050
and bestow them on Lord Rahl.

21:49.240 --> 21:50.539
Whe are the others?

21:50.540 --> 21:51.710
Where's Kahlan?

21:51.870 --> 21:53.749
- Giller has them. 
- What?

21:53.750 --> 21:56.729
The Wizard was unaffected by the Confessor's touch.

21:56.730 --> 21:57.659
That's impossible.

21:57.660 --> 21:59.029
I saw it with my own eyes.

21:59.030 --> 22:01.190
It more of Giller's magic.

22:01.210 --> 22:04.629
Your friends e his prisoners now.

22:04.630 --> 22:06.099
We have to get them out of there.

22:06.100 --> 22:07.429
That's suicide.

22:07.430 --> 22:08.949
The constellation has almost aligned.

22:08.950 --> 22:10.730
Rahl will be here at any moment.

22:10.750 --> 22:12.409
Which is why we have to go now.

22:12.410 --> 22:16.059
It's too late for that. The charges are being set.

22:16.060 --> 22:17.220
We have to stop it.

22:18.440 --> 22:20.099
You are the Seeker.

22:20.100 --> 22:23.109
It is your destiny to kill Darken Rahl.

22:23.110 --> 22:26.019
I won't sacrifice my friends to do it.

22:26.020 --> 22:28.059
I already sacrificed my nephew and my men.

22:28.060 --> 22:30.320
Are their lives worth any less?

22:30.490 --> 22:34.949
The confesser would want you to do it
You know she would.

22:34.950 --> 22:36.390
Get out of my way.

22:52.850 --> 22:54.800
It is time, My Lord.

22:59.610 --> 23:04.197
spell

23:33.960 --> 23:36.270
I'm so glad you're here, My Lord.

23:38.440 --> 23:42.010
I have something very special to show you.

24:13.100 --> 24:14.790
The Seeker lives.

24:18.190 --> 24:21.539
A captured Confess is quite a prize, Giller.

24:21.540 --> 24:23.110
Yes, My Lord.

24:23.300 --> 24:25.099
So your elixir works.

24:25.100 --> 24:27.690
Her magic had no effect on me.

24:31.750 --> 24:34.780
You have made more progress than I thought, Giller.

24:36.020 --> 24:39.320
And you're certain the Shurkia
can harvest the Confessor's powers?

24:39.940 --> 24:43.080
Soon her powers will be yours, My Lord.

24:48.180 --> 24:51.560
Lord Rahl, the Seeker is alive

24:51.750 --> 24:53.530
and inside the Keep.

25:04.480 --> 25:06.500
I've lit the fe.
We have to get out of here.

25:12.250 --> 25:14.430
But I was supposed to set off the Dragon's Breath.

25:14.550 --> 25:16.650
Kahlan told me-- Kahlan's been captured.

25:16.870 --> 25:18.090
She's still here.

25:19.110 --> 25:20.540
We just saved her life.

25:24.150 --> 25:25.990
And apparently...

25:27.480 --> 25:29.810
you just savedine.

25:34.310 --> 25:36.120
Rahl.

25:38.860 --> 25:41.370
Twice now I've been told you were dead.

25:41.960 --> 25:43.770
Yet here you are.

25:52.070 --> 25:53.820
This is quite an honor.

25:53.880 --> 25:56.460
It's not every day I get to meet the Seeker.

25:57.530 --> 26:00.840
It's not every day I get to fulfill the Prophecy.

27:47.810 --> 27:51.479
It'll take more than Prophecy to defeat me,

27:51.480 --> 27:53.350
Richard Cypher.

28:05.750 --> 28:07.250
Richard.

28:11.890 --> 28:13.320
Richard.

28:17.670 --> 28:19.350
Richard!

28:33.820 --> 28:35.090
Kahlan.

28:40.010 --> 28:45.840
I know how this must pain you both greatly.

28:49.050 --> 28:50.469
Seeing the one you love

28:50.470 --> 28:51.980
in such misery.

28:53.730 --> 28:56.799
Almost as painful as sharing an undying love

28:56.800 --> 28:59.010
which you can never consummate.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.820
And what would you know about love?

29:06.590 --> 29:11.410
Except that you will never feel it from anyone.

29:22.150 --> 29:26.940
It's such a pity you never had a potion such as this...

29:33.110 --> 29:37.560
...so that you could feel the soft touch of your lover's caress.

29:38.680 --> 29:42.520
Her tender, passionate embrace.

29:51.100 --> 29:54.680
Being unable to express your love for each other.

29:55.380 --> 29:58.650
Such a fate is unimaginable.

30:03.390 --> 30:05.800
But when we're finished...

30:08.430 --> 30:12.520
your touch will no longer be a threat to anyone.

30:47.260 --> 30:51.930
You have carried the burden of your powers for so long, Kahlan.

30:52.550 --> 30:54.960
I'm going to lift that burden...

30:57.380 --> 30:59.380
...and take it upon myself.

30:59.630 --> 31:03.379
I won't need my powers to see through your lies.

31:03.380 --> 31:06.560
Kahlan, if you can really see the truth,

31:06.560 --> 31:10.429
you would know that all I want to do
is end my people's suffering.

31:10.430 --> 31:11.810
No!

31:16.500 --> 31:20.230
And when I have the power of Confession,

31:20.330 --> 31:22.870
there will be no more war, no more strife.

31:26.870 --> 31:32.109
Only harmony and true, lasting peace.

31:32.110 --> 31:34.030
You won't succeed.

31:36.980 --> 31:38.669
The people will rise up.

31:38.670 --> 31:39.713
I may be dead, 

31:39.713 --> 31:42.843
but another Seeker will take my place and destroy you.

31:49.520 --> 31:55.180
Why kill you when I can turn the Seeker into a devoted servant?

32:03.170 --> 32:05.889
You'll be the first one I Coess.

32:05.890 --> 32:07.320
No!

32:15.368 --> 32:20.787
spell

32:31.060 --> 32:32.870
Kahlan.

32:33.870 --> 32:35.680
Kahlan!

32:42.578 --> 32:44.100
Kahlan!

32:44.520 --> 32:46.099
What is it, Giller?

32:46.100 --> 32:47.640
I don't know, My Lord.

33:03.210 --> 33:04.709
The Blood Rage.

33:04.710 --> 33:06.400
Run, My Lord!

33:16.800 --> 33:18.410
Kill her.

33:34.900 --> 33:37.080
Kill him.

33:55.220 --> 33:56.980
Kill him.

33:58.150 --> 34:00.020
Kahlan.

34:04.650 --> 34:06.970
Release the Seeker.

34:30.261 --> 34:34.877
spell

35:10.070 --> 35:11.780
Kahlan.

35:15.200 --> 35:16.690
Kahlan?

35:19.100 --> 35:20.570
Kahlan, it's me.

35:20.750 --> 35:22.090
Richard.

35:22.970 --> 35:24.410
It's me.

35:29.270 --> 35:32.310
Kahlan, it's me, Richard.

35:44.290 --> 35:45.750
Are you all right?

35:46.650 --> 35:48.330
Yeah, I think so.

35:48.430 --> 35:49.880
What was that?

35:56.090 --> 35:58.590
We have to get Emma and Laura out of here.

35:59.390 --> 36:00.650
Yeah.

36:01.290 --> 36:02.620
Come on.

36:20.490 --> 36:21.900
Richard.

36:27.580 --> 36:29.240
It's Giller's potion.

36:31.280 --> 36:33.200
There's only one left.

36:45.290 --> 36:48.120
You realize what we could do with this.

36:56.410 --> 36:57.789
The magic was destroyed,

36:57.790 --> 37:00.239
so we can't undo what was done to Emma.

37:00.240 --> 37:04.450
This potion will allow you to be with her
without fear of her touch.

37:07.500 --> 37:08.930
Thank you.

38:13.680 --> 38:16.090
I can never thank you enough.

38:16.350 --> 38:20.549
Oh, I'm just happy to see you all together as a family again.

38:20.550 --> 38:23.080
I heard what Darken Rahl said.

38:24.670 --> 38:29.270
So I know what you gave up when you gave the potion to Chase.

38:31.790 --> 38:36.570
But maybe someday you'll find a way to be together.

38:46.120 --> 38:48.070
I don't know how to thank you, Riard.

38:48.230 --> 38:50.580
You should know by now you don't have to.

38:50.750 --> 38:53.240
Darken Rahl knows you're alive now.

38:53.450 --> 38:55.190
You're gonna need me with you.

38:58.990 --> 39:00.440
Go with Devlin.

39:00.630 --> 39:02.339
The resistance could use your help.

39:02.340 --> 39:05.590
And this will give you a chance
to be a husband and a father again.

39:05.870 --> 39:08.070
When the time comes, I'll know where to find you.

39:14.640 --> 39:16.919
It was an honor to fightalongs

39:16.920 --> 39:18.379
The honor was all mine.

39:18.380 --> 39:22.289
Some friends of ours passed me a message for you
en I went to get e healer for Cse.

39:22.290 --> 39:23.920
From a Ruben Rybnik.

39:24.290 --> 39:25.630
Zedd.

39:28.330 --> 39:30.600
"The weather has not improved.

39:30.760 --> 39:35.070
"When it does, I'll seek the company of dear friends in the woods tomorrow."

39:40.300 --> 39:42.400
I have news, My Lord.

39:47.980 --> 39:51.019
Our sorcerers have discovered that the Wizard Zeddicus

39:51.020 --> 39:54.830
is using an obscuring spell to mask our tracer cloud.

39:55.690 --> 39:58.890
No more excuses, Egremont.

39:59.310 --> 40:02.270
find the Wizd, and bring me the Box.

40:05.930 --> 40:08.470
<i>"The weather has not improved."</i>

40:08.510 --> 40:12.010
Zedd must not have been able to get away from Rahl's tracer cloud.

40:13.140 --> 40:19.510
"When it does, I'll seekthe comfort of d in the woods tomorrow."

40:20.150 --> 40:23.160
Well, he wants us to meet him in a forest, but where?

40:23.830 --> 40:26.940
And it must be close if he expects us to join him tomorrow.

40:27.940 --> 40:31.340
Maybe it's not about when but where.

40:32.320 --> 40:34.050
The Morrow Woods.

40:34.820 --> 40:36.120
Where's that?

40:36.820 --> 40:38.540
In D'Har

40:38.900 --> 40:41.060
We have a long journey ahead of us.

40:41.500 --> 40:43.370
You know, we can stop if you're tired.

40:43.550 --> 40:46.280
You must be exhausted after what Gill's magic did to you.

40:46.910 --> 40:50.090
I'm not so sure it was just Giller's magic.

40:50.830 --> 40:52.290
What do you mean?

40:56.260 --> 40:58.559
There's a legend of an ancient magic

40:58.560 --> 41:01.750
possessed only by the most powerful Confessors.

41:02.740 --> 41:07.510
It's an uncontrollable force known as Con Dar.

41:08.810 --> 41:10.470
The Blood Rage.

41:11.420 --> 41:13.050
Why did it happen?

41:14.710 --> 41:18.730
Maybe it was because of something at Giller did to me.

41:22.910 --> 41:25.610
Or maybe it was because of you, Richard.

41:28.780 --> 41:33.270
I was so afraid that you would become Rahl's slave

41:33.400 --> 41:35.190
and your mission would fail.

41:36.120 --> 41:37.880
I couldn't let that happen.

41:39.110 --> 41:40.389
Whatever you did,

41:40.390 --> 41:41.549
whatever it was,

41:41.550 --> 41:43.720
you saved us both.

41:44.260 --> 41:46.269
If you hadn't tried to save me,

41:46.270 --> 41:48.420
Darken Rahl would be dead right now.

41:50.540 --> 41:52.969
You had the chance to kill him,

41:52.970 --> 41:56.790
but you risked everything for something that can never be.

41:57.560 --> 42:01.839
Rahl was wrong when he said our fate was unimaginable.

42:01.840 --> 42:06.290
The only unimaginable fate is one without you.

42:13.790 --> 42:16.620
And he was wrong about something else too.

42:18.570 --> 42:21.370
I will fulfill the Prophecy.

42:23.180 --> 42:25.500
I'm going to kill Rahl.

42:29.690 --> 42:32.328
And I'm going to do it with you by my side.

42:33.621 --> 42:39.231
