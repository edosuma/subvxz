00:09.250 --> 00:11.730
<b>Th-Thank you very much...</b>

00:11.730 --> 00:13.240
<b>Why did you not call for help?</b>

00:14.410 --> 00:15.240
<b>Here...</b>

00:15.570 --> 00:16.400
<b>And here...</b>

00:16.800 --> 00:17.990
<b>You're covered in blood!</b>

00:22.030 --> 00:24.640
<b><i>What is this creature?</i></b>

00:27.010 --> 00:28.530
<b><i>What do I want</i></b>

00:30.260 --> 00:31.620
<b><i>to do with her?</i></b>

01:52.000 --> 01:57.090
<b>Taking Stock x And x Taking Action</b>

01:59.750 --> 02:02.990
<b>One day remains before the selection.</b>

02:02.990 --> 02:06.730
<b>The capital city, Peijing, wakes to a quiet morning.</b>

02:16.480 --> 02:17.610
<b>Good morning.</b>

02:18.350 --> 02:20.390
<b>You boys are up early.</b>

02:22.350 --> 02:25.120
<b>We have nineteen hours until 
midnight strikes on selection day.</b>

02:25.590 --> 02:27.160
<b>Tonight, we finally make our move.</b>

02:27.670 --> 02:30.120
<b>Let's do one final check.</b>

02:31.080 --> 02:32.320
<b>Once inside, Gon and I</b>

02:32.320 --> 02:36.020
<b>immediately head up the central stairway, 
toward the throne room.</b>

02:36.690 --> 02:37.440
<b>Yep.</b>

02:37.850 --> 02:38.880
<b>Ikalgo will take</b>

02:38.880 --> 02:42.600
<b>the northeast elevator down to the 
basement, to search for Palm.</b>

02:44.090 --> 02:47.320
<b>If you find her, escape without us.</b>

02:47.320 --> 02:48.140
<b>Right.</b>

02:48.800 --> 02:52.350
<b>If the King and his three Royal Guards 
are in the throne room,</b>

02:52.350 --> 02:54.150
<b>we proceed with the plan.</b>

02:54.770 --> 02:57.530
<b>The problem is, what if they're not there?</b>

02:58.260 --> 03:00.500
<b>You're really hung up on that...</b>

03:01.200 --> 03:04.390
<b>What are the chances of that happening?</b>

03:04.390 --> 03:06.900
<b>Well, it's highly unlikely.</b>

03:07.230 --> 03:09.450
<b>But the unusual happens pretty often.</b>

03:09.450 --> 03:11.540
<b>Aren't you contradicting yourself?</b>

03:12.770 --> 03:17.320
<b>We researched the enemy's behavior extensively 
before deciding on a day for the attack.</b>

03:17.850 --> 03:21.430
<b>When you're waiting for someone to be 
in a certain place, at a certain time,</b>

03:21.930 --> 03:25.800
<b>that's typically when the unexpected happens.</b>

03:26.540 --> 03:28.500
<b>In my old job, I saw this all the time.</b>

03:28.900 --> 03:32.470
<b>The unusual always happens 
on the day you've chosen.</b>

03:33.870 --> 03:37.050
<b>In my old job, I could wait for the next chance,</b>

03:37.050 --> 03:39.570
<b>to ensure my success.</b>

03:40.600 --> 03:42.100
<b>But this time, that isn't an option.</b>

03:42.920 --> 03:44.370
<b>We can't wait.</b>

03:44.370 --> 03:46.330
<b>Once we move, there's no turning back.</b>

03:46.820 --> 03:49.720
<b>A moment's hesitation can mean death!</b>

03:50.830 --> 03:53.080
<b>So we should take time now to decide</b>

03:53.080 --> 03:55.460
<b>how we'll act in different situations.</b>

03:56.650 --> 04:01.070
<b>Even if they aren't in the throne room, 
if they're still in the palace, it's okay.</b>

04:01.640 --> 04:06.790
<b>Pitou's <i>En</i> is enough to cover the palace and 
its surrounding courtyards, and then some.</b>

04:08.260 --> 04:14.100
<b>So if we sense that creepy aura when we enter,</b>

04:14.100 --> 04:16.390
<b>we'll know that they're there.</b>

04:17.450 --> 04:21.510
<b>From there, we just follow that 
sinister aura to where it feels densest,</b>

04:21.510 --> 04:23.470
<b>and they'll be at its center.</b>

04:25.140 --> 04:28.680
<b>The question is what we do if 
we don't sense Pitou's aura.</b>

04:29.080 --> 04:32.360
<b>In other words, what we do 
if they aren't in the palace.</b>

04:32.360 --> 04:36.450
<b>Or if they're in the palace, 
but they aren't using <i>En</i>.</b>

04:36.790 --> 04:38.450
<b>Would they be in the palace,</b>

04:38.450 --> 04:41.120
<b>but not using <i>En</i> to guard the King?</b>

04:41.420 --> 04:45.500
<b>That's what happened when 
Knov-san infiltrated the palace!</b>

04:45.500 --> 04:46.510
<b>Huh?</b>

04:46.990 --> 04:49.390
<b>Yes, that's what I can't make sense of.</b>

04:50.320 --> 04:53.890
<b>According to Colt, Knov saw Pouf's aura.</b>

04:55.260 --> 04:58.070
<b>The Royal Guard never leaves the King's side.</b>

04:58.070 --> 05:02.570
<b>So if Pouf was there, the other two were 
also in the palace with the King.</b>

05:03.680 --> 05:07.220
<b>Then, why did Pitou stop 
using the puppets and <i>En</i>,</b>

05:07.220 --> 05:09.060
<b>leaving Pouf to handle security,</b>

05:09.060 --> 05:11.640
<b>which allowed Knov to infiltrate the palace?</b>

05:12.580 --> 05:15.590
<b>I believe the reason has to do with 
how Pitou's power works...</b>

05:16.910 --> 05:19.600
<b>Then we should ask Colt.</b>

05:19.950 --> 05:20.720
<b>Yeah.</b>

05:23.100 --> 05:26.510
<b>I'd guess that during that time, 
Pitou was healing someone.</b>

05:26.840 --> 05:27.800
<b>Healing?</b>

05:28.380 --> 05:32.060
<b>I told you that Pitou was the 
one who restored Kite, yes?</b>

05:33.100 --> 05:37.060
<b>Thinking back, I don't believe Pitou 
used <i>En</i> during that period.</b>

05:38.170 --> 05:41.120
<b>Thus, healing must require a 
great deal of concentration.</b>

05:41.800 --> 05:44.320
<b>So while healing someone,</b>

05:44.870 --> 05:47.570
<b>Pitou cannot use <i>En</i> or the puppets.</b>

05:48.920 --> 05:50.320
<b>Now it makes sense.</b>

05:51.080 --> 05:52.870
<b>Which means that someone,</b>

05:52.870 --> 05:56.300
<b>most likely the King or one of the 
Royal Guard, was injured and</b>

05:56.300 --> 05:59.200
<b>required healing, so the <i>En</i> 
and puppets disappeared.</b>

05:59.200 --> 06:00.710
<b>But hold on...</b>

06:01.300 --> 06:05.710
<b>Who would have been able to 
injure one of those monsters?</b>

06:06.100 --> 06:07.110
<b>True...</b>

06:07.460 --> 06:08.960
<b>An internal dispute?</b>

06:08.960 --> 06:11.870
<b>Maybe the King injured one of the Royal Guard?</b>

06:11.870 --> 06:14.220
<b>No, that's impossible.</b>

06:14.650 --> 06:17.860
<b>There is no chance that Pitou 
would endanger the King</b>

06:17.860 --> 06:21.590
<b>by removing that <i>En</i> to heal someone else!</b>

06:22.320 --> 06:23.800
<b>I guarantee it.</b>

06:24.240 --> 06:26.320
<b>Which means that the one injured...</b>

06:26.860 --> 06:28.130
<b>...was the King!</b>

06:29.960 --> 06:32.990
<b>I see... What you're saying makes sense.</b>

06:33.420 --> 06:37.500
<b>But then the bigger question 
is who injured the King.</b>

06:38.200 --> 06:40.330
<b>The Royal Guard wouldn't harm him.</b>

06:40.330 --> 06:44.750
<b>But other soldiers could never put 
so much as a scratch on him.</b>

06:45.100 --> 06:48.260
<b>Yep, so our conclusion was...</b>

06:49.640 --> 06:51.240
<b>The King injured himself?!</b>

06:51.770 --> 06:54.320
<b>Under what circumstances 
would that have happened?</b>

06:54.320 --> 06:57.760
<b>We don't know why, but it's the only explanation.</b>

07:01.530 --> 07:06.550
<b><i>I'll admit that I didn't question our 
sudden stroke of luck too much...</i></b>

07:06.950 --> 07:11.610
<b><i>But that chance was only possible 
under abnormal circumstances.</i></b>

07:12.890 --> 07:15.590
<b><i>Are they starting to lose control?</i></b>

07:16.910 --> 07:18.260
<b><i>That isn't good...</i></b>

07:18.640 --> 07:21.760
<b><i>I'm starting to think something's 
going on inside the palace.</i></b>

07:25.660 --> 07:28.170
<b>We will now begin moving to the palace.</b>

07:29.220 --> 07:33.910
<b>Citizens of sector A-1, assemble in 
Diego Plaza at once.</b>

07:36.590 --> 07:40.610
<b>The citizens of the other sectors 
should prepare to move out.</b>

07:46.390 --> 07:48.980
<b>Oh, they're starting to file out.</b>

07:49.340 --> 07:51.630
<b>They've begun their march...</b>

07:52.240 --> 07:55.840
<b>Ten hours until midnight, when the selection starts.</b>

07:57.450 --> 08:00.890
<b>In twenty-five hours, tomorrow afternoon at three,</b>

08:01.480 --> 08:05.060
<b>five million humans will fill the palace grounds.</b>

08:06.710 --> 08:08.520
<b>Has the situation in Peijing changed?</b>

08:08.840 --> 08:13.010
<b>I thought it was only one skilled enemy, 
but now there are a bunch.</b>

08:13.500 --> 08:16.190
<b>So there are reinforcements.</b>

08:17.010 --> 08:21.650
<b>They may try to use the celebration 
as cover to approach us.</b>

08:21.650 --> 08:24.800
<b>Then the danger will be greatest 
during the selection.</b>

08:25.210 --> 08:29.630
<b>Yes, since the King will be 
participating in the selection.</b>

08:31.290 --> 08:34.010
<b>Our greatest concern is</b>

08:34.010 --> 08:37.810
<b>the King somehow being taken beyond our reach.</b>

08:39.000 --> 08:43.650
<b>Assuming that they have a <i>Nen</i> 
user capable of translocation,</b>

08:44.200 --> 08:49.920
<b>and that that person can use the ability 
to isolate the King somewhere else...</b>

08:51.380 --> 08:55.090
<b>That means at least one of us must stay</b>

08:55.090 --> 08:57.720
<b>by the King's side during the selection.</b>

08:58.050 --> 08:59.710
<b>The King won't allow it.</b>

09:00.170 --> 09:04.490
<b>As it is, he's been upset by how 
close we've stayed to him.</b>

09:04.950 --> 09:07.730
<b>Then we guard him secretly, 
without his knowledge.</b>

09:08.690 --> 09:12.780
<b>We need someone to stay just close 
enough to monitor his surroundings</b>

09:12.780 --> 09:16.140
<b>while still carrying out his own role in the selection...</b>

09:17.880 --> 09:20.650
<b><i>Whose size won't attract attention,</i></b>

09:21.620 --> 09:25.000
<b><i>who won't get absorbed in an amusing task...</i></b>

09:25.940 --> 09:29.760
<b>Very well, I am the best choice for this.</b>

09:30.390 --> 09:33.720
<b>Strictly by process of elimination, of course...</b>

09:37.210 --> 09:38.320
<b>What's wrong?</b>

09:38.840 --> 09:42.510
<b>Their presences have completely disappeared.</b>

09:43.820 --> 09:47.380
<b>I can't sense any residual aura.</b>

09:47.900 --> 09:52.050
<b>They must be using <i>Zetsu</i> to hide 
among the marching humans.</b>

09:58.090 --> 09:59.210
<b>Hey.</b>

10:00.810 --> 10:02.580
<b>There are so many people...</b>

10:03.120 --> 10:05.460
<b>Around a hundred per building.</b>

10:06.060 --> 10:07.900
<b>They must have been packed inside.</b>

10:08.550 --> 10:11.470
<b>Then if we conceal our presences,</b>

10:11.470 --> 10:14.500
<b>they can only assume that we're 
hiding among the citizens.</b>

10:14.930 --> 10:18.220
<b>Maybe they'll cancel the march?</b>

10:18.670 --> 10:19.720
<b>No way.</b>

10:20.300 --> 10:23.970
<b>That would mean delaying or 
even canceling the celebration.</b>

10:24.370 --> 10:28.230
<b>Which would imply the King had 
accepted defeat and compromised.</b>

10:28.600 --> 10:31.460
<b>The Royal Guard won't let that happen.</b>

10:32.400 --> 10:35.340
<b>The celebration will begin as scheduled, 
no matter the cost.</b>

10:35.670 --> 10:37.670
<b>Tomorrow morning, at 3 PM!</b>

10:37.670 --> 10:40.500
<b>And that won't change.</b>

10:43.240 --> 10:45.050
<b>Once the humans began to move,</b>

10:45.050 --> 10:48.410
<b>my puppets could no longer tell them apart...</b>

10:49.510 --> 10:52.090
<b>Should I recall them?</b>

10:52.090 --> 10:56.260
<b>No, giving the enemy free 
rein would be dangerous.</b>

10:56.960 --> 11:03.570
<b>Have the puppets join the soldiers that 
are guiding the citizens, as a deterrent.</b>

11:19.870 --> 11:21.070
<b>'Sup?</b>

11:21.530 --> 11:25.820
<b>As expected, the puppets have joined the march.</b>

11:26.250 --> 11:30.520
<b>In another hour, those sectors will be deserted.</b>

11:33.920 --> 11:38.170
<b>There are six entrances to the 
rooms that lead to the palace.</b>

11:39.300 --> 11:43.090
<b>We'll avoid the entrances in front of the 
palace, where security will be tighter,</b>

11:43.710 --> 11:47.320
<b>and wait by entrances A, B, 
and C, behind the palace.</b>

11:48.520 --> 11:51.510
<b>Once we've entered the rooms,</b>

11:51.510 --> 11:55.480
<b>the only exit will lead inside the palace.</b>

11:55.750 --> 11:57.860
<b>What? You scared?</b>

11:57.860 --> 11:59.060
<b>Don't be absurd.</b>

11:59.060 --> 12:01.110
<b>I merely want to be sure we're prepared.</b>

12:01.660 --> 12:05.530
<b>Waiting by the entrances involves 
quite a lot of risk.</b>

12:06.190 --> 12:11.350
<b>But if we enter the rooms too early, 
we won't be able to exit until midnight.</b>

12:12.110 --> 12:13.290
<b>True...</b>

12:13.290 --> 12:15.840
<b>If we receive any useful information,</b>

12:15.840 --> 12:19.130
<b>we want to be free to act on it...</b>

12:19.450 --> 12:22.450
<b>And we can't use cell phones near the palace,</b>

12:22.450 --> 12:25.240
<b>since the Ants will pick up on the signal.</b>

12:25.690 --> 12:29.830
<b>I think it's dangerous to spend hours 
waiting inside the rooms,</b>

12:30.340 --> 12:33.770
<b>not knowing if there have been 
accidents or changes in the situation.</b>

12:34.220 --> 12:38.240
<b>But you're the one who said it was 
risky to wait outside the palace.</b>

12:38.240 --> 12:39.150
<b>Yes...</b>

12:39.460 --> 12:43.340
<b>You shouldn't take their security net lightly.</b>

12:43.340 --> 12:44.680
<b>I'll take care of it.</b>

12:46.840 --> 12:51.910
<b>I'm the only one who can freely 
enter and exit these rooms.</b>

12:52.520 --> 12:54.460
<b>If anything happens, I'll tell you.</b>

12:55.880 --> 12:58.590
<b>For now, you should rest here.</b>

12:58.960 --> 13:00.300
<b>Will you be okay?</b>

13:00.870 --> 13:04.270
<b>I shouldn't have any problem 
investigating the area...</b>

13:04.740 --> 13:09.430
<b>Even if I'm right beside the palace, as long 
as I'm out of range of Pitou's <i>En</i>...</b>

13:12.740 --> 13:15.190
<b>But you should be careful.</b>

13:16.530 --> 13:19.110
<b>Pitou doesn't use a standard circular <i>En</i>.</b>

13:19.360 --> 13:23.030
<b>It changes shape like an amoeba, 
giving it extended range.</b>

13:24.900 --> 13:26.820
<b>That's what Kite came in contact with.</b>

13:27.510 --> 13:29.860
<b>And it was probably deliberate...</b>

13:30.230 --> 13:34.710
<b>It's a fighter's instinct to want to know 
how strong the opponent is.</b>

13:35.130 --> 13:40.850
<b>And his instinct led him to misjudge their strength.</b>

13:42.610 --> 13:45.240
<b>In some areas, that <i>En</i> can 
stretch two kilometers.</b>

13:45.910 --> 13:47.600
<b>Make sure you stay out of range.</b>

13:48.620 --> 13:49.890
<b>Don't worry about it.</b>

13:50.640 --> 13:54.930
<b>In this room, I'm the one who most fears them.</b>

13:55.420 --> 13:57.350
<b>I won't do anything crazy.</b>

13:58.720 --> 14:00.150
<b>I promise you that.</b>

14:04.880 --> 14:07.380
<b>We will now head to the palace.</b>

14:07.380 --> 14:10.950
<b>Any person who leaves their line 
will be shot on the spot.</b>

14:11.520 --> 14:13.450
<b>Move out!</b>

14:25.370 --> 14:26.420
<b>Pitou...</b>

14:27.330 --> 14:31.300
<b>You knew that Komugi was being attacked?</b>

14:31.550 --> 14:34.480
<b>Yes, I was monitoring the area with <i>En</i>.</b>

14:34.830 --> 14:35.560
<b>However,</b>

14:35.830 --> 14:39.570
<b>I determined that there was no threat 
to Your Majesty, so I ignored it.</b>

14:40.460 --> 14:43.440
<b>From now on, monitor Komugi's surroundings,</b>

14:43.440 --> 14:45.780
<b>and deal with any threats at once.</b>

14:47.070 --> 14:49.200
<b>Yes, as you command.</b>

15:06.940 --> 15:09.720
<b><i>Tens of thousands of people are marching</i></b>

15:09.720 --> 15:12.390
<b><i>in a line toward the King.</i></b>

15:13.090 --> 15:16.370
<b><i>Like ants... No, lemmings.</i></b>

15:16.370 --> 15:17.910
<b><i>A march of death.</i></b>

15:19.090 --> 15:22.230
<b><i>It will be dark soon.</i></b>

15:22.690 --> 15:25.180
<b><i>I can tell Morel and the 
others to come out...</i></b>

15:30.160 --> 15:31.550
<b><i>What is</i></b>

15:32.590 --> 15:34.010
<b><i>that?</i></b>

15:39.040 --> 15:40.220
<b><i>Wing scales?</i></b>

15:41.230 --> 15:46.630
<b><i>The wind is carrying the scales of 
his wings toward the citizens...</i></b>

15:47.110 --> 15:48.170
<b><i>That means...</i></b>

15:53.280 --> 15:54.300
<b><i>As I thought...</i></b>

15:55.490 --> 15:59.780
<b><i>They all look completely vacant and dazed.</i></b>

16:00.680 --> 16:03.630
<b><i>Those scales have a hypnotic effect.</i></b>

16:06.320 --> 16:08.690
<b>Stay in line as you advance!</b>

16:09.270 --> 16:10.740
<b>Stay in line!</b>

16:11.460 --> 16:13.810
<b>Once you reach your position, wait for orders.</b>

16:13.810 --> 16:15.370
<b>Do not move!</b>

16:16.280 --> 16:21.370
<b><i>Simple orders delivered repeatedly, 
while tanks roll in the background</i></b>

16:21.790 --> 16:26.030
<b><i>can easily seep into a mind exhausted 
from hours of marching...</i></b>

16:27.200 --> 16:30.380
<b><i>It's the perfect situation for using hypnosis!</i></b>

16:31.670 --> 16:36.150
<b><i>Once the selection begins, 
and blood starts to fly,</i></b>

16:36.150 --> 16:39.470
<b><i>they will continue to quietly stand in place.</i></b>

16:40.070 --> 16:41.710
<b><i>Until it's their turn.</i></b>

16:45.780 --> 16:48.230
<b>Hypnosis? I see...</b>

16:48.990 --> 16:52.180
<b>If they're brainwashed, the citizens won't run.</b>

16:52.590 --> 16:55.110
<b>But this works out for us.</b>

16:55.110 --> 16:56.070
<b>Eh?</b>

16:56.470 --> 16:58.330
<b>If we make a lot of noise,</b>

16:58.330 --> 17:01.600
<b>we won't have to worry about citizens panicking.</b>

17:01.600 --> 17:02.620
<b>Ah!</b>

17:03.290 --> 17:07.830
<b>There won't be any stampede of humans 
falling over each other to escape.</b>

17:08.330 --> 17:09.880
<b>That's a big boon.</b>

17:10.160 --> 17:17.360
<b>Assuming that over half of the people 
will be in place at midnight,</b>

17:17.360 --> 17:22.790
<b>we would have expected a stampede to 
leave tens of thousands of casualties.</b>

17:23.050 --> 17:25.520
<b>Our biggest concern has been addressed.</b>

17:26.220 --> 17:28.270
<b>We can go crazy.</b>

17:28.920 --> 17:30.900
<b>Six hours to go.</b>

17:34.810 --> 17:36.450
<b>Everyone's here.</b>

17:37.020 --> 17:38.830
<b>Have you heard from Palm?</b>

17:39.310 --> 17:40.150
<b>No.</b>

17:42.890 --> 17:43.950
<b>Oh...</b>

17:44.470 --> 17:46.900
<b>We'll keep waiting until half 
an hour before go time.</b>

17:47.260 --> 17:50.960
<b>If we knew what's inside before 
going in, it'd be very different...</b>

17:51.210 --> 17:52.070
<b>Yeah.</b>

17:53.400 --> 17:56.000
<b><i>They both look composed.</i></b>

17:56.800 --> 17:58.780
<b><i>Killua, in particular, shows</i></b>

17:58.780 --> 18:02.220
<b><i>none of the mental weakness he 
displayed when we fought.</i></b>

18:02.460 --> 18:05.320
<b><i>I'd almost say he's brimming with confidence.</i></b>

18:05.710 --> 18:07.830
<b><i>But for some reason,</i></b>

18:08.540 --> 18:12.470
<b><i>he seems on the verge of fading away.</i></b>

18:14.060 --> 18:17.770
<b><i>No, I don't have time to worry about others.</i></b>

18:18.480 --> 18:22.870
<b><i>I'm the one suffering from the most anxiety.</i></b>

18:23.710 --> 18:25.760
<b><i>The fate of humanity rests on me...</i></b>

18:28.400 --> 18:30.380
<b><i>Colt is a good guy...</i></b>

18:31.180 --> 18:34.880
<b><i>Meleoron and Ikalgo both have good hearts.</i></b>

18:35.730 --> 18:40.390
<b><i>It doesn't matter if they're humans or Ants. 
Everyone has a heart.</i></b>

18:40.390 --> 18:41.900
<b><i>That's what I want to believe.</i></b>

18:42.860 --> 18:44.890
<b><i>Hopefully, the King also has one.</i></b>

18:46.200 --> 18:50.520
<b><i>But some of them must be killed...</i></b>

18:51.960 --> 18:53.760
<b><i>If we don't kill them, we'll be killed!</i></b>

18:54.900 --> 18:57.490
<b><i>Kite, it's almost time.</i></b>

18:57.910 --> 19:01.530
<b><i>I promise to turn you back...</i></b>

19:03.370 --> 19:05.320
<b><i>By defeating that Ant.</i></b>

19:07.470 --> 19:09.090
<b><i>He's fired up...</i></b>

19:09.530 --> 19:11.040
<b><i>I'll focus on providing support.</i></b>

19:11.490 --> 19:14.290
<b><i>So no one can interfere in your battle...</i></b>

19:15.550 --> 19:18.510
<b><i>Using my new Kanmuru technique.</i></b>

19:19.980 --> 19:21.500
<b><i>My body feels heavy.</i></b>

19:22.000 --> 19:24.720
<b><i>I'm suffering from days without rest...</i></b>

19:25.120 --> 19:28.180
<b><i>On a scale of 1 to 100, my current 
condition would be 40...</i></b>

19:28.180 --> 19:30.890
<b><i>No, 35...</i></b>

19:31.620 --> 19:34.330
<b><i>But I can't be whining now.</i></b>

19:34.940 --> 19:37.480
<b><i>With Knov out, I'm the only one left.</i></b>

19:38.460 --> 19:40.990
<b><i>I was hoping to fight at full strength,</i></b>

19:40.990 --> 19:44.810
<b><i>but it's easier to accept my fate this way.</i></b>

19:45.490 --> 19:50.750
<b><i>I'll focus on playing the decoy and 
drawing my target from the King.</i></b>

19:53.630 --> 19:56.390
<b><i>I'm sorry, Morel and everyone...</i></b>

19:58.180 --> 20:00.750
<b><i>But I can't bring myself to go.</i></b>

20:02.720 --> 20:04.850
<b>I'll take a look outside.</b>

20:12.150 --> 20:16.030
<b><i>So two minutes is the longest 
I can hold my breath...</i></b>

20:16.320 --> 20:21.240
<b><i>Given how tense I'll be inside, my limit 
will probably be, at most, half that.</i></b>

20:22.020 --> 20:23.270
<b><i>Good enough...</i></b>

20:23.270 --> 20:24.990
<b><i>One minute is more than enough time!</i></b>

20:27.580 --> 20:31.300
<b><i>Tomorrow, at midnight, I will be reborn.</i></b>

20:32.290 --> 20:35.750
<b><i>A few days ago, I couldn't have 
dreamed of such a life.</i></b>

20:36.550 --> 20:38.750
<b><i>Thank you, Killua.</i></b>

20:39.850 --> 20:43.480
<b><i>I promise to carry out my mission for you!</i></b>

20:45.190 --> 20:48.300
<b><i>Tomorrow will be my birthday!</i></b>

21:06.070 --> 21:08.280
<b><i>I am the King.</i></b>

21:10.630 --> 21:13.370
<b><i>But who am I?</i></b>

21:15.880 --> 21:19.840
<b><i>Why was I brought into this world?</i></b>

21:25.330 --> 21:27.430
<b>Time's up... Let's go!</b>

21:44.220 --> 21:45.220
<b><i>Palm...</i></b>

21:56.850 --> 21:59.870
<b>Ten minutes remain until 
they enter the palace.</b>

23:24.880 --> 23:27.140
<b>Next time: Confusion x And x Expectation.</b>

23:27.140 --> 23:29.180
<b>It's so cold, Gon...</b>

23:29.180 --> 23:31.970
<b>They said Admiral Winter is coming!</b>

23:31.970 --> 23:34.260
<b>I think you mean General Winter.</b>
