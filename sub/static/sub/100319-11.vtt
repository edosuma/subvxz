WEBVTT

00:04.655 --> 00:06.255
So you're clear on the plan, Mom?

00:06.280 --> 00:09.114
Yes. Stay aloof, reveal nothing,

00:09.149 --> 00:10.934
keep small talk to a minimum.

00:10.959 --> 00:12.349
Good, and what about eye contact?

00:12.374 --> 00:14.674
You two are being very dramatic.

00:14.699 --> 00:17.100
I have dealt with salespeople
before in my life.

00:17.125 --> 00:19.237
Hm, I guess we'll just forget
about the timeshare in Canada.

00:19.261 --> 00:21.395
Yeah, or the 20-inch rims and
booming sound system

00:21.420 --> 00:23.108
- you said "came with" the Volvo.
- Or adding avocado

00:23.132 --> 00:25.006
every time the waiter offers.

00:25.031 --> 00:28.261
Hey! I'm starting to really regret
asking you guys to come with me.

00:28.286 --> 00:30.250
You're nothing but dollar
signs to these vultures.

00:30.275 --> 00:31.775
They want to prey on your desperation

00:31.800 --> 00:33.360
- and your vulnerability.
- It's true.

00:33.385 --> 00:35.332
I've got this. Come on.

00:43.783 --> 00:45.682
I'd like to start by
just telling you all

00:45.707 --> 00:48.330
how truly and genuinely
sorry I am for your loss.

00:48.355 --> 00:50.574
Thanks, but we haven't lost him yet.

00:50.599 --> 00:52.589
Oh. Well, then,
let me say how lucky he is

00:52.614 --> 00:54.914
to have such a loving and
caring family that has made

00:54.939 --> 00:57.144
the tough-but-wise
decision to plan ahead.

00:57.169 --> 00:59.400
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Listen.
We don't have all day,

00:59.425 --> 01:01.074
so let's just bottom-line it.

01:01.099 --> 01:02.619
What are we talking about here, Dale?

01:02.644 --> 01:04.857
Uh, well, Maggie,
picking an eternal resting spot

01:04.893 --> 01:07.044
is one of the most difficult
things you're ever gonna do.

01:07.068 --> 01:09.205
And here at Birdsong Memorial, our focus

01:09.230 --> 01:11.229
is simplifying this very difficult time

01:11.254 --> 01:13.861
by anticipating any
and all of your needs.

01:13.886 --> 01:16.602
We handle the service,
the casket, the plot,

01:16.638 --> 01:19.005
the headstone, the flowers,
the music, the programs,

01:19.030 --> 01:20.291
the car service and so on.

01:20.316 --> 01:21.465
What is "and so on"?

01:21.490 --> 01:23.760
Are you gonna write
our eulogies for us, too?

01:23.785 --> 01:25.644
Well, actually, we can.
If you take a look

01:25.669 --> 01:28.458
at the Gold Deluxe Package,
we have poets on hand.

01:28.483 --> 01:30.383
There's some that
are very good at haiku,

01:30.408 --> 01:33.509
some dirty limericks,
which certain families enjoy.

01:33.534 --> 01:35.600
We've got painters,
if you like a nice painting.

01:35.625 --> 01:37.925
We could also do a nice
sculpture of your loved one

01:37.950 --> 01:40.018
in any repose you want.
Make him standing,

01:40.043 --> 01:41.520
make him sitting, make him laying down.

01:41.544 --> 01:44.792
Sorry, what is the difference
between the Gold Package

01:44.817 --> 01:47.175
and the Gold Deluxe Package?

01:48.603 --> 01:49.792
I'm sorry, Maggie. You know what?

01:49.816 --> 01:52.364
I'm going a little too fast.
I apologize.

01:52.388 --> 01:54.511
Let's start with something
simpler, okay?

01:54.868 --> 01:56.768
Follow me.

01:58.379 --> 02:00.379
As you can see, we have a wide selection

02:00.404 --> 02:02.204
of caskets to choose from.

02:02.250 --> 02:03.816
Everything from a simple pine box,

02:03.841 --> 02:06.475
all the way up to
museum-grade Carrara marble.

02:06.500 --> 02:08.834
Two tons of eternal bliss.

02:11.549 --> 02:14.261

So, Maggie, is there a particular
model that's speaking to you?

04:21.798 --> 04:25.735
David? We need to leave. Now.

04:25.760 --> 04:28.478
Mom, I am right there with you.

04:28.930 --> 04:31.163
Ooh, feel free to swear if you want.

04:31.188 --> 04:33.080
I'm fine, honey.

04:34.161 --> 04:37.424
Synced & corrected by QueenMaddie
www.addic7ed.com

04:44.207 --> 04:45.454
Morning.

04:45.479 --> 04:47.283
Afternoon, actually.

04:47.308 --> 04:48.697
Oh, wow, you're right.

04:48.987 --> 04:51.556
You wouldn't believe
the day I've had so far.

04:53.502 --> 04:56.198
Which you clearly don't
want to hear anything about.

04:56.223 --> 04:58.346
So Leif, how was your morning?
Any progress on the...

04:58.371 --> 05:00.628
On the bake-off between the
4th floor and the 6th floor?

05:00.653 --> 05:03.112
I think you could say...

05:03.827 --> 05:07.518
- Yes.
- Ohh. Got it.

05:07.543 --> 05:10.628
You can catch me up
to speed when we get off.

05:14.770 --> 05:16.385
Shall we?

05:18.145 --> 05:21.088
All right, uh,
this is a terrible, terrible way

05:21.113 --> 05:24.448
for you to find out,
but Leif's actually on my team now.

05:25.492 --> 05:27.120
What?

05:27.503 --> 05:29.385
You can't steal our best programmer

05:29.410 --> 05:30.768
in the middle of a bake-off.

05:30.793 --> 05:33.338
I didn't steal him. Leif came to me.

05:33.363 --> 05:34.741
It's true, both that I came to him,

05:34.765 --> 05:36.956
and that I am the best programmer.

05:36.981 --> 05:38.924
Are you really that mad at me?

05:38.949 --> 05:40.461
That you would be willing to work with

05:40.485 --> 05:42.417
your least favorite human
being at Sprq Point?

05:42.442 --> 05:44.635
Okay, first of all,
Tobin's my least favorite,

05:44.660 --> 05:47.127
and second, I just want my floor to win.

05:47.152 --> 05:48.451
That's all.

05:48.476 --> 05:49.476
Sure.

05:56.699 --> 06:00.567
Did you actually approve
Leif joining Max on Floor 6?

06:00.592 --> 06:03.604
Oh, that's a lot of heat for
somebody coming in at 12:43 p.m.

06:03.629 --> 06:04.894
Do these things work? I have taken

06:04.918 --> 06:06.351
way more than 65 steps today.

06:06.376 --> 06:07.886
- What about The Chirp?
- What about it?

06:07.910 --> 06:10.479
Leif put in for a transfer
to go to the 6th floor,

06:10.504 --> 06:12.206
and how could I say no after everything

06:12.231 --> 06:13.925
that happened between us?
I'm trying to be sensitive.

06:13.949 --> 06:15.393
He shouldn't be someplace
he doesn't want to be.

06:15.417 --> 06:17.729
Okay, well, now we really
have to take down

06:17.754 --> 06:19.479
Ava and all of them.

06:19.962 --> 06:21.792
Although...

06:22.089 --> 06:24.581
it's incredibly bad
timing for me because of

06:24.606 --> 06:27.151
everything that's going on
with my dad, and I'm not sure

06:27.176 --> 06:29.799
I can fully be on my A game
right now. Sorry.

06:29.824 --> 06:32.432
Hey, don't worry about it.
We'll figure out the 6th floor.

06:32.457 --> 06:34.167
Take all the time you need.

06:34.192 --> 06:35.612
Really?

06:36.171 --> 06:39.120
Zoey... you've been there for me.

06:39.145 --> 06:41.079
I'm gonna be there for you.

06:41.823 --> 06:43.332
Don't smile at me.
I don't want to look at

06:43.356 --> 06:45.756
your sad, appreciative eyes.
Get outta here.

06:46.291 --> 06:48.689
You take a mindful breath.

06:50.530 --> 06:52.479
Can you believe this stuff?

06:52.761 --> 06:56.409
Casket samples and interior swatches,

06:56.441 --> 06:58.495
engraving fonts?

06:58.520 --> 07:00.979
I had no idea there
would be so many choices.

07:01.004 --> 07:02.729
Where do I even begin?

07:02.754 --> 07:05.151
Let's just take it one by one.

07:06.126 --> 07:07.410
Do you want to start
with the headstones?

07:07.434 --> 07:09.001
No.

07:10.197 --> 07:12.229
I don't know. I need
your father for this.

07:12.254 --> 07:14.917
He's the one that would know
how to make all these decisions.

07:14.942 --> 07:17.209
Well, do you want to ask him?

07:26.247 --> 07:28.846
Hey, darling.

07:28.871 --> 07:31.005
Do you need anything?

07:42.575 --> 07:44.475
He's not doing well.

07:44.988 --> 07:46.463
He's not eating anything.

07:46.488 --> 07:49.323
He's sleeping so much of the time,
and half the time

07:49.348 --> 07:52.237
I don't think he's even
following what we're saying.

07:55.455 --> 07:57.388
Can I ask you something?

07:57.620 --> 08:00.167
Why didn't you guys do this sooner?

08:01.762 --> 08:03.862
Well, if you mean,

08:03.887 --> 08:07.784
when we were younger,
probably because we thought

08:07.809 --> 08:09.963
we had all the time in the world.

08:09.988 --> 08:15.901
And I never could have imagined
that it would happen this fast.

08:16.315 --> 08:18.987
No one did. And now I've gotta go back

08:19.012 --> 08:23.167
to that stupid place and
pick out burial plots.

08:23.192 --> 08:27.229
I can't even pick out the
linen for the coffin liner.

08:27.254 --> 08:32.581
I mean, it's just a lot.
It's a lot, Zoey.

08:35.246 --> 08:38.159
Oh, my... hmm.

08:38.746 --> 08:39.847
Would you like a straw?

08:39.871 --> 08:41.878
Would that help you drink
my wine even faster?

08:41.903 --> 08:43.414
I know you're joking,
but that would be great.

08:43.438 --> 08:46.143
When was the last time
you went funeral shopping?

08:46.168 --> 08:47.792
Paper, plastic, or metal?

08:47.817 --> 08:48.973
You know what? I'll get all three.

08:48.997 --> 08:50.253
My mom is so overwhelmed

08:50.278 --> 08:52.167
with all the things
that she has to decide

08:52.192 --> 08:54.644
and I'm just as freaked out as she is.

08:54.669 --> 08:56.417
Which is why I've
already planned my funeral

08:56.442 --> 08:58.933
in elaborate detail. It is much easier

08:58.958 --> 09:00.871
to make these decisions when
you're thinking rationally.

09:00.895 --> 09:02.925
Okay. Hit me. What do you got?

09:02.950 --> 09:05.691
So, there's a dress code.
Nothing teal, cerulean,

09:05.716 --> 09:07.331
or anything with a high neckline.

09:07.356 --> 09:08.707
There's gonna be a sit-down dinner

09:08.731 --> 09:10.478
where dessert's gonna be served first.

09:10.503 --> 09:12.703
And I have prerecorded five
songs that I want played

09:12.728 --> 09:15.066
because who else is gonna
sing it better than me?

09:15.091 --> 09:16.823
♪ Nobody ♪

09:17.253 --> 09:18.621
No.

09:18.992 --> 09:20.120
Oh, and bring tissues,

09:20.145 --> 09:22.167
because I absolutely
demolish "Hallelujah."

09:22.192 --> 09:23.668
- It almost sounds fun.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

09:23.692 --> 09:25.190
It won't be. And if any of my "friends"

09:25.214 --> 09:27.909
are caught not sobbing, they got-tah go.

09:27.934 --> 09:29.870
Will you speak at my funeral?

09:30.021 --> 09:33.257
'Cause I think you're
officially now my best friend.

09:33.282 --> 09:36.595
- Uh-oh. More Max drama?
- Yeah.

09:36.620 --> 09:38.855
I think he pretty much
wants nothing to do with me.

09:39.255 --> 09:40.488
Is somebody coming over?

09:40.512 --> 09:42.099
Oh, I gave Eddie a key.

09:42.124 --> 09:43.847
What? He's hot. I'm weak.

09:43.872 --> 09:45.003
You do the math.

09:45.028 --> 09:46.222
- Hi, Zoey.
- Hi.

09:46.247 --> 09:49.167
Mo, guess who just got a fancy callback?

09:49.192 --> 09:51.948
- The dog food commercial?
- No, I didn't get that one.

09:51.973 --> 09:53.894
But remember that Broadway review show?

09:53.919 --> 09:55.212
On the cruise ship?

09:55.237 --> 09:57.886
It pays more than anything
that I've ever done,

09:57.911 --> 10:00.137
and I'll actually be able to
pay my bills after traveling

10:00.161 --> 10:02.230
and seeing the world for eight months!

10:02.255 --> 10:03.855
That's amazing. I hope you get it.

10:03.880 --> 10:06.614
Oh, eight months.
I don't think that I heard that detail.

10:06.639 --> 10:08.081
Well, it was such a long shot.

10:08.106 --> 10:09.805
- I must've kept it to myself.
- Hmm.

10:09.830 --> 10:11.339
But now that there's a chance,

10:11.364 --> 10:14.120
maybe you can help me get ready for it?

10:14.229 --> 10:17.534
Yeah. Sure. Happy to help.

10:17.902 --> 10:20.769
Great. I'm gonna go take a shower.

10:23.980 --> 10:25.646
Mm-mm.

10:29.682 --> 10:30.807
Yes!

10:30.832 --> 10:33.526
A completed AR interface for The Chirp.

10:33.551 --> 10:35.909
What?! I would like to say
that I'm surprised

10:35.934 --> 10:37.734
we hit the next benchmark, but honestly,

10:37.759 --> 10:39.793
I've come to expect this
level of excellence.

10:39.818 --> 10:41.217
It's actually kind of boring now.

10:41.242 --> 10:44.626
Get on over here, Jeanine.
Jeanine! Ready?

10:44.651 --> 10:48.222
And... milk it, drink it,
toss it, floss it,

10:48.247 --> 10:51.269
sorry, my bad, Carrie Ann Moss it.

10:53.239 --> 10:55.901
Hey, don't be jealous, K Lo.
Jeanine put in the work,

10:55.926 --> 10:57.495
but you will get your handshake, too.

10:57.520 --> 10:59.433
Just give it time.

10:59.838 --> 11:02.206
It's weirding you out me
being up here, huh?

11:02.231 --> 11:03.276
I could tell.

11:03.301 --> 11:05.237
The only thing that's weird is that

11:05.262 --> 11:07.651
you're actually an impressive manager.

11:09.320 --> 11:11.787
- I meant that as a compliment.
- No, I took it as such.

11:11.812 --> 11:13.932
That might be the nicest
thing you've ever said to me.

11:14.394 --> 11:15.784
Oh, what are you drawing?

11:15.809 --> 11:16.832
We could probably hang this up

11:16.856 --> 11:19.029
in the company creativity corner.

11:19.054 --> 11:20.831
That is...

11:21.949 --> 11:23.480
nothing.

11:26.560 --> 11:27.753
Hey, don't worry, man.

11:27.778 --> 11:31.542
Zoey told me about
your "side project" with Joan.

11:31.567 --> 11:36.265
Well, that "project" has been defunded.

11:36.809 --> 11:39.476
So, is that why you wanted

11:39.501 --> 11:41.203
to transfer up here? Because of her?

11:41.228 --> 11:43.094
Just needed a change of scenery.

11:44.657 --> 11:45.957
I can't believe these words

11:45.982 --> 11:48.149
are coming out of my mouth
right now, but...

11:48.174 --> 11:50.890
do you want to get a
beer with me after work?

11:54.771 --> 11:56.257
Well, I hope your mom's all right.

11:56.282 --> 11:58.210
Yeah, it's just a lot to handle, so,

11:58.235 --> 11:59.883
we're doing everything
we can to try to help

11:59.907 --> 12:01.106
make things a little easier.

12:01.131 --> 12:03.974
Hmm. Funny. That's one of
our mottoes here at Birdsong.

12:03.999 --> 12:08.945
Ah. Our memorial chapel,
with seating for up to 300 people.

12:08.970 --> 12:11.046
Now if you're looking for
a multi-media tribute,

12:11.071 --> 12:14.382
we have got a surround
sound 4K projection system.

12:14.407 --> 12:16.179
I mean, this picture is so good,

12:16.204 --> 12:17.649
sometimes I sneak in here after hours

12:17.673 --> 12:19.523
just to binge-watch "The Crown."

12:19.548 --> 12:21.164
- Great show.
- Oh, isn't it the best?

12:21.189 --> 12:23.226
Okay, as, you know...
As good as "The Crown" is,

12:23.251 --> 12:25.597
I think what we'd like to do is
just take a look at the grounds.

12:25.621 --> 12:27.500
Man on a mission.
I like your style, my friend.

12:27.525 --> 12:30.296
Now, if you act today,
I can get you a great deal

12:30.321 --> 12:33.312
on a family plot with
up to six places in it.

12:33.337 --> 12:35.382
Dad, Mom, Zoey, me, Em...

12:35.407 --> 12:36.742
Oh, I'm not going in the ground.

12:36.767 --> 12:39.093
- Well...
- You know I'm claustrophobic.

12:39.118 --> 12:40.429
I'm for sure getting cremated.

12:40.454 --> 12:42.554
Baby, I thought we agreed
to be together forever.

12:42.579 --> 12:44.406
The contract states,
"Till death do us part."

12:44.431 --> 12:45.987
After that, I'm free
to do my own thing again.

12:46.011 --> 12:47.012
- No, I don't...
- You know what?

12:47.036 --> 12:48.248
I got the golf cart all heated up.

12:48.272 --> 12:52.062
Let's continue this discussion
en route, as the French say.

12:52.289 --> 12:53.985
Colman, Foy,
I can't pick my favorite queen.

We just put down a deposit.

14:43.754 --> 14:45.426
It's a very pretty area.

14:45.451 --> 14:47.965
Super quiet,
right near this lovely fountain.

14:47.990 --> 14:50.402
- Well, that's not gonna work.
- Why not?

14:50.927 --> 14:54.051
Well, Zoey, I love you,
but I saw that fountain.

14:54.076 --> 14:56.376
It's hideous. I don't want
to look at that thing.

14:56.401 --> 14:58.582
Great. In that case, Dale did show us

14:58.607 --> 15:01.213
this other area that looked nice,
Main Grove?

15:01.238 --> 15:03.571
Uh-huh, that's right near the highway,

15:03.596 --> 15:05.480
and your dad hates traffic.

15:06.011 --> 15:08.520
Okay, um...

15:09.004 --> 15:13.105
Do you want to look at
pictures of other spots?

15:13.130 --> 15:15.163
We're just trying to make
this easier for you, Mom.

15:15.188 --> 15:17.816
No, I know,
and I really do appreciate that,

15:17.841 --> 15:20.527
but this is not right.
None of that is right.

15:21.573 --> 15:23.949
Then I think this might
be beyond my grasp.

15:23.974 --> 15:27.239
Do you know anyone who's
also gone through...

15:27.264 --> 15:29.531
Nope, none of our friends
have been through this yet.

15:29.556 --> 15:31.207
I'm the first.

15:33.924 --> 15:36.658
Wow, Mom, I didn't know
you were such a pioneer.

15:37.567 --> 15:42.504
Yeah, I am. I'm a true trailblazer.

15:42.992 --> 15:45.129
Tell me what to do. How can I help?

15:45.777 --> 15:47.982
Well, you can start
by getting your deposit back

15:48.007 --> 15:51.395
'cause I'm not gonna be rushed
into a decision like that.

15:52.737 --> 15:54.670
Yep.

15:55.142 --> 15:58.949
I'm sorry I'm late,
or super early for tomorrow.

15:58.974 --> 16:00.374
What day is it again?

16:00.399 --> 16:02.980
Yo! I got you, Z-Money.

16:03.005 --> 16:05.439
I just completed all the
AR interface for The Chirp.

16:05.464 --> 16:07.230
Check it before you wreck it.

16:07.404 --> 16:10.301
This better be worth the trek, Tobin.

16:15.228 --> 16:17.174
I gotta admit, I'm impressed.
That was super fast.

16:17.198 --> 16:19.355
Hmm? Told you I'm not
just another pretty face.

16:20.795 --> 16:22.427
Who's sitting at Max's desk?

16:22.452 --> 16:24.566
What's up, ZZ Top?

16:24.591 --> 16:25.865
We're a little light on manpower, so,

16:25.889 --> 16:28.879
came back to where it all began,
give the troops a hand.

16:28.904 --> 16:31.002
I don't think I've ever
seen you in a hoodie before.

16:31.027 --> 16:34.028
Oh, yeah, well,
this is made with cashmere yarn

16:34.053 --> 16:36.274
spun by Benedictine nuns in Italy.

16:36.299 --> 16:38.177
It cost more than all your
stock options are worth,

16:38.201 --> 16:40.221
but if you want to call it
a hoodie, sure.

16:40.831 --> 16:42.003
No way!

16:42.038 --> 16:45.768
Hey! Toto. The dog, not the band.

16:45.793 --> 16:47.286
Stop Slacking with Leif.

16:47.310 --> 16:49.145
We do not fraternize with the 6th floor.

16:49.170 --> 16:50.630
I just want to know how
Leif's day is going.

16:50.654 --> 16:52.709
What he's doing,
if he's making any new friends.

16:52.734 --> 16:54.626
He isn't, by the way.
I'm happy about it.

16:54.651 --> 16:57.457
Well, can I just say thank you
all for holding down the fort?

16:57.482 --> 17:01.417
I will catch up as soon
as I can. Promise.

17:03.071 --> 17:05.537
Hey, Red. You think
you can take an hour away

17:05.561 --> 17:07.060
from your family tonight?

17:07.086 --> 17:09.270
I could probably sneak away. Why?

17:09.295 --> 17:11.214
Well, you look like you could use it.

Uh, no. I hate karaoke

17:30.699 --> 17:32.932
more than I hate black light bowling.

17:33.231 --> 17:34.796
It's just the closest bar to work.

17:34.821 --> 17:36.167
I know why you want to talk to me.

17:36.191 --> 17:37.816
- Oh.
- I'm not focused.

17:37.841 --> 17:38.873
We're falling behind,

17:38.902 --> 17:41.496
and we have zero chance
of winning this bake-off.

17:41.809 --> 17:45.270
Wrong. I wanted to tell you
about, um, my mom.

17:45.582 --> 17:50.238
Um... my mom looked like Audrey Hepburn,

17:50.263 --> 17:52.941
but talked like a
college football coach.

17:52.966 --> 17:57.080
She was very, very tough,
a stay-at-home mom,

17:57.105 --> 17:59.981
but, um, I think had it
been a different time

18:00.006 --> 18:03.207
and not Bismarck, North Dakota,

18:03.232 --> 18:05.872
she could've ruled the world.

18:06.957 --> 18:11.159
And when she got sick,
I was working my way up

18:11.184 --> 18:15.050
through the ranks at Google,
trying as hard as I could

18:15.075 --> 18:16.397
to get to the next level,

18:16.422 --> 18:20.757
and... on the night she died,

18:20.782 --> 18:23.215
um, I was preparing my presentation

18:23.240 --> 18:25.847
for the Google smart pencils,
you remember that?

18:25.872 --> 18:28.076
Uh, barely?

18:28.101 --> 18:29.999
Exactly.

18:31.381 --> 18:34.206
Work may seem like it's
the most important thing,

18:34.231 --> 18:36.227
but you will never get this time back,

18:36.252 --> 18:38.653
so please stop apologizing.

18:41.391 --> 18:43.439
- Oh, no.
- What?

18:43.464 --> 18:45.497
12 o'clock. 3 o'clock.

18:47.140 --> 18:49.574
Oh, uh, hey, uh, don't look now,

18:49.599 --> 18:51.887
but Zoey and Joan
are right in front of us.

18:51.912 --> 18:53.190
I just told you not to look.

18:53.215 --> 18:54.402
Uh, what do we do?

18:54.437 --> 18:55.715
Do we leave? I think we should leave.

18:55.739 --> 18:56.996
I don't really want to
see Joan right now.

18:57.020 --> 18:59.268
No, we can't leave. That means they won.

18:59.293 --> 19:01.940
You gotta be strong, man.
Show her you're okay.

19:01.965 --> 19:04.457
Right. Well, I don't know if I am okay,

19:04.482 --> 19:07.333
and now we're walking towards them.
Why are we walking towards them?

19:17.029 --> 19:18.403
- Hey.

19:18.428 --> 19:21.058

- Rock solid.

19:21.083 --> 19:22.807

19:24.268 --> 19:26.794
of hardness for minerals.

19:27.372 --> 19:28.486
Okay.

19:28.511 --> 19:30.023
So you and Leif are
drinking buddies now?

19:30.047 --> 19:31.983
We're just grabbing a beer.
I like to connect

19:32.008 --> 19:34.074
with all the members of my
team on a personal level.

19:34.099 --> 19:36.747
Ohh! That's heartwarming.

19:37.113 --> 19:39.482
But Leif will stab you in the
back the first chance he gets.

19:39.507 --> 19:41.293
Well, thanks for the warning.
Now Leif and I have

19:41.317 --> 19:43.669
some serious work matters
to attend to, right, Leif?

19:43.694 --> 19:46.031

Hey, you. How goes it?

23:00.692 --> 23:03.964
Well, I'm heading back to the cemetery

23:03.989 --> 23:05.495
for my third time this week,

23:05.520 --> 23:07.855
so I can't exactly say "awesome."

23:07.880 --> 23:08.918
What's wrong with your doorknob?

23:08.942 --> 23:10.394
It has seen too many keys.

23:10.419 --> 23:12.769
Uh-oh. Something happened with Eddie?

23:12.794 --> 23:13.995
Nothing happened.

23:14.784 --> 23:16.761
Other than him possibly
sailing the open seas

23:16.786 --> 23:18.793
for eight months with a bunch of
bored, wealthy tourists

23:18.817 --> 23:20.051
and handsome chorus boys looking for

23:20.075 --> 23:21.980
a little jalapeño in their cocktail,

23:22.005 --> 23:23.574
so I decided to jump ship before he did.

23:23.598 --> 23:25.870
Okay. Mo, I thought
you really liked each other.

23:25.895 --> 23:27.214
Why not try long-distance?

23:27.239 --> 23:29.339
No, the only long-distance relationship

23:29.364 --> 23:30.870
that I have is with my astrologer,

23:30.895 --> 23:32.590
and if she doesn't stop
charging me by the minute,

23:32.614 --> 23:34.027
I'm-a have to break up with her, too.

23:34.051 --> 23:35.152
So have a good day.

23:37.918 --> 23:39.329
Really appreciate the refund, Dale.

23:39.353 --> 23:41.377
My mom just needs a little bit of time.

23:41.402 --> 23:42.839
Totally understand.

23:42.864 --> 23:45.683
Time, after all,
is our most precious commodity.

23:45.827 --> 23:47.660
Now that said, there is a world in which

23:47.685 --> 23:49.418
I can still get you that 6-plot special,

23:49.443 --> 23:50.917
but you'll have to order today.

23:50.942 --> 23:52.475
Oh, that's all right, Dale.

23:52.500 --> 23:56.492
Oh, please! No one said
there's a right way to grieve.

23:56.517 --> 23:58.548
When Arthur died, I binge-watched

23:58.573 --> 24:01.497
Nordic crime dramas and ate
potato chips for a month.

24:01.522 --> 24:04.011
Who gives a crap? If Barbara wants

24:04.036 --> 24:06.503
to sell the houseboat and move to Japan,

24:06.528 --> 24:09.386
I say, "Mwah! Sayonara, sister."

24:09.613 --> 24:11.901
It's good to see you all again.

24:11.926 --> 24:14.159
Hi. Sorry to interrupt.

24:14.184 --> 24:18.981
I'm Zoey. I saw you yesterday
during my tour with Dale.

24:19.006 --> 24:21.440
Is he giving you the hard sell?
Don't fall for it.

24:21.465 --> 24:23.831
Check out his suits.
The man's doing fine.

24:23.856 --> 24:25.421
I'm Deb, by the way.

24:25.446 --> 24:27.773
You seem to know a lot about this place.

24:27.798 --> 24:28.798
Damn straight.

24:28.823 --> 24:31.417
I should get a commission
for all the referrals I make.

24:31.442 --> 24:35.089
When my husband passed,
the place took good care of me.

24:35.114 --> 24:37.533
So much so I recommended
it to all my friends,

24:37.558 --> 24:40.870
which keeps bringing me back.
Now I'm like the weeds

24:40.895 --> 24:44.329
that won't stop growing all
over the Tower of Tranquility.

24:44.365 --> 24:46.019
They can't get rid of me.

24:46.901 --> 24:50.237
This is gonna sound... strange,

24:50.262 --> 24:53.649
but, um, if you're not going
to any more funerals today,

24:53.674 --> 24:56.034
do you want to hang out?

24:56.912 --> 25:00.073
Why not? You only live once.

25:01.784 --> 25:03.626
♪ Bow chicka wow! ♪

25:03.651 --> 25:05.228
Someone just finished the
pattern-matching function

25:05.252 --> 25:07.761
on the reverse image search. It was me.

25:07.786 --> 25:09.075
It was Tobin!

25:11.145 --> 25:12.635
I am so pumped right now,

25:12.660 --> 25:15.236
I think... I'm gonna take a victory lap.

25:15.261 --> 25:16.896
Please. We all know
your bathroom schedule.

25:16.920 --> 25:18.453
We're not fooled.

25:21.443 --> 25:24.339
Wait, Tobin,
can you send me the pattern file?

25:24.364 --> 25:25.737
Can... Mm.

25:31.098 --> 25:34.378
_

25:44.250 --> 25:45.616
Tobin.

25:45.641 --> 25:47.080
Hey, Tobin.

25:47.105 --> 25:49.895
This would be a great place
to murder someone, huh?

25:50.420 --> 25:52.277
That's not what's happening
here, right? That's...

25:52.301 --> 25:54.704
I know you're funneling
Chirp code to Tobin.

25:54.729 --> 25:56.154
What are you doing?

25:56.179 --> 25:57.964
Don't you want to win the bake-off?

25:58.560 --> 26:00.222
No.

26:00.790 --> 26:02.718
I want you to win the bake-off.

26:02.743 --> 26:04.964
I'm not giving up on us,
Joan, and I wanted to

26:04.989 --> 26:07.401
show you with a big grand gesture.

26:07.426 --> 26:10.294
It's a big stupid gesture that
could get you fired by Ava.

26:10.319 --> 26:12.605
I don't care. You're worth the risk.

26:12.630 --> 26:15.542
I'm really not. Look...

26:15.789 --> 26:18.611
You're brilliant, you're special.

26:18.636 --> 26:21.593
And you're very sweet,
but I let this go way too far.

26:21.618 --> 26:24.418
It's unprofessional. I crossed a line

26:24.443 --> 26:26.855
and I'm sorry, but it's over.

26:30.474 --> 26:32.273
Well, what about The Chirp?

26:32.441 --> 26:33.907
I mean, we hatched that together,

26:33.932 --> 26:36.099
and they're making
some strides upstairs.

26:36.124 --> 26:37.776
I'm gonna figure that out.

26:38.012 --> 26:42.347
But until I do, no more
corporate espionage, promise?

26:45.426 --> 26:46.692
Okay.

26:49.659 --> 26:51.316
Thank you.

26:53.512 --> 26:57.313
It's been a while since we had
a mother-daughter dessert date.

26:57.498 --> 27:00.299
I know. But when I woke up this morning,

27:00.326 --> 27:03.284
it just felt like a
Pie World kind of day.

27:03.309 --> 27:05.253
What can I say?

27:06.422 --> 27:08.956
Zoey! This place, it's aces!

27:08.981 --> 27:10.380
What a good call!

27:10.405 --> 27:12.933
Oh, my gosh, that is my friend Deb.

27:13.105 --> 27:16.276
- You have a friend named Deb?
- Doesn't everyone?

27:16.855 --> 27:18.112
Hey Deb, how you doing?

27:18.137 --> 27:20.596
Well, pre-diabetic, but loving it.

27:20.621 --> 27:22.531
Deb, this is my mom, Maggie.

27:22.556 --> 27:24.089
- Hi.
- Mom, this is my friend Deb.

27:24.114 --> 27:25.722
- Hi.
- Grab a seat.

27:25.747 --> 27:27.823
My home is your home.

27:28.171 --> 27:30.071
Take a seat, Mom.

27:30.096 --> 27:32.691
What is happening right now?

27:33.772 --> 27:35.050
Mom...

27:35.699 --> 27:38.315
I wanted to be the one
to help you through all this,

27:38.339 --> 27:40.191
but you're losing the love of your life

27:40.216 --> 27:42.916
and I don't have any
experience with that.

27:42.941 --> 27:44.507
But Deb does.

27:44.532 --> 27:48.015
And I feel like she
and I met for a reason,

27:48.040 --> 27:51.909
so can you just please talk to her?

27:52.871 --> 27:56.214
How good does this look?

27:57.564 --> 28:01.499
So... who's ready to talk about death?

28:08.191 --> 28:09.800
Mmm! Mmm!

28:09.824 --> 28:11.901
You, um, must really like pie.

28:11.926 --> 28:16.175
Well, no, I just have a really
terrible time making decisions.

28:16.718 --> 28:18.964
So do I, lately.

28:20.371 --> 28:24.268
Hey, um, listen, I hope
this doesn't hurt your feelings,

28:24.293 --> 28:27.795
but opening up to a complete stranger,

28:27.820 --> 28:31.466
that is just not exactly me.

28:31.491 --> 28:34.067
Hey, no pressure here.

28:34.258 --> 28:36.192
No judgment either.

28:36.826 --> 28:38.997
Um... my kids, they say,

28:39.022 --> 28:41.677
I have "analysis paralysis."

28:41.702 --> 28:44.223
Oh, mine called it "compare and despair"

28:44.248 --> 28:46.248
when I couldn't land on a cemetery.

28:46.273 --> 28:50.942
Everything had to be exactly
perfect for my Arthur.

28:51.359 --> 28:53.993
But you want to hear something crazy?

28:54.356 --> 28:56.684
I hardly remember the funeral.

28:56.970 --> 28:59.591
All that choosing the perfect coffin

28:59.616 --> 29:03.098
and the most "peaceful" flowers,

29:03.848 --> 29:08.591
I stared at a random
woman's shoes for 30 minutes

29:08.616 --> 29:10.145
wondering where she bought them,

29:10.170 --> 29:12.552
and also, why she was even there.

29:12.577 --> 29:15.177
To this day, we don't know.

29:16.963 --> 29:20.583
Well, the thing is, Deb, um...

29:22.802 --> 29:27.161
I don't... I don't know
how to do this...

29:27.551 --> 29:31.020
because I've been with Mitch for...

29:31.842 --> 29:34.169
over 40 years.

29:34.475 --> 29:37.098
Yeah. Well, we were 38.

29:37.802 --> 29:39.583
Do you think Mitch really cares

29:39.608 --> 29:42.419
what color peaceful flowers you pick?

29:42.809 --> 29:47.332
Well, we are in the landscape
design business, so...

29:48.592 --> 29:51.114
But I do get your point.

29:51.299 --> 29:54.255
I think that, um, maybe what's happening

29:54.280 --> 29:58.200
is that every single
one of these decisions

29:58.225 --> 30:04.169
just feels like it's moving
me a little closer to, uh...

30:08.322 --> 30:10.628
...to him being gone,

30:12.789 --> 30:15.156
and to it all...

30:16.563 --> 30:18.503
being real.

30:21.119 --> 30:24.699
Well, it is. It's very real, babe.

30:24.724 --> 30:27.855
And... and no one can
take that burden from you.

30:27.880 --> 30:30.449
It's just something
you gotta wear, like a...

30:30.943 --> 30:33.839
A giant cinderblock sweater.

30:33.864 --> 30:35.839
Well, for what it's worth, you...

30:35.864 --> 30:38.480
You seem to be wearing it very well.

30:39.249 --> 30:41.472
Look, I... I... I...

30:41.497 --> 30:43.628
I could give you a...

30:44.677 --> 30:49.074
a big lecture on all the
things you gain from loss...

30:49.555 --> 30:52.980
Empathy, appreciation,

30:53.600 --> 30:57.027
strength, resilience.

30:57.052 --> 31:00.292
But we just gotta get
you through this first.

31:01.364 --> 31:06.042
The thing is I don't really
want to get through it.

31:06.448 --> 31:08.949
Here's the hard part, Miss Maggie.

31:08.974 --> 31:10.761
I'm afraid it's not up to you.

31:10.786 --> 31:15.433
It's an awful train that
doesn't make stops,

31:15.458 --> 31:19.745
and it's going,
whether you want it to or not.

31:20.402 --> 31:22.589
Still...

31:23.278 --> 31:25.714
if it makes you feel any better...

31:27.561 --> 31:29.339
I've been on it for quite a while now,

31:29.371 --> 31:32.378
and you're welcome
to come sit next to me

31:32.403 --> 31:34.222
any time you want.

31:35.267 --> 31:37.000
Thank you.

31:40.779 --> 31:42.503
Sorry.

31:43.776 --> 31:46.894
Oh, it's Zoey.

31:46.919 --> 31:49.511
_

31:49.687 --> 31:52.730
_

32:09.958 --> 32:12.581
Pretty dramatic choice for a
neutral ground here, Joanie.

32:12.606 --> 32:14.394
This would be a great
place to kill someone.

32:14.419 --> 32:16.706
Oh, God. We do think alike.

32:16.731 --> 32:18.128
Uh, we have a problem.

32:18.153 --> 32:20.542
Someone from your team has
been leaking information

32:20.567 --> 32:22.133
down to the 4th floor.

32:23.173 --> 32:25.292
- Is it Max?
- No, it's Leif.

32:25.317 --> 32:27.050
Well, that's a massive ethics violation.

32:27.075 --> 32:28.608
Leif needs to be let go immediately.

32:28.633 --> 32:30.011
Well, what he did was stupid,

32:30.036 --> 32:31.839
but I'd rather not let him go.

32:31.864 --> 32:33.581
He worked on my team for seven years.

32:33.606 --> 32:35.472
I think I can handle it directly.

32:36.520 --> 32:38.820
Why are you telling me this?

32:39.436 --> 32:41.722
Instead of just using
our work against us?

32:41.747 --> 32:45.315
Well, I love a fight, but uh...
I like to fight fair.

32:45.379 --> 32:47.558
Can't do that now.
The bake-off's poisoned.

32:47.583 --> 32:48.942
So what do you want to do about it?

32:48.966 --> 32:52.534
Maybe what Leif did
is partially my fault.

32:52.625 --> 32:54.758
I don't know that we've always

32:54.783 --> 32:57.317
created the healthiest work environment,

32:57.342 --> 33:01.477
so I thought, as the top two
ranking women in this company,

33:01.862 --> 33:04.519
what if we band together for once?

33:04.671 --> 33:08.183
Show them a different
way to get things done?

33:11.811 --> 33:14.042
Thanks for meeting me
on your lunch break.

33:14.067 --> 33:15.933
Note to self... make
sure boyfriend's stuff

33:15.958 --> 33:17.996
is out of the apartment
before you change the locks.

33:18.020 --> 33:20.636
Hey, you really think he's
gonna get into it with you

33:20.661 --> 33:21.887
in the middle of a big audition?

33:21.911 --> 33:23.590
Child, we have no idea
what he's capable of.

33:23.614 --> 33:26.206
So I'm going to calmly give
him back his dance bag,

33:26.231 --> 33:28.965
and then have Eddie out of
my life once and for all.

33:28.990 --> 33:30.723
Hmm. Mm-mm.

33:32.224 --> 33:33.847
Okay, that was pretty rough.

33:33.872 --> 33:36.855
Um, I'm gonna need for
you guys to be cleaner,

33:36.880 --> 33:38.152
- more dynamic...
- There he is.

33:38.177 --> 33:39.957
... keep your heads up.
Uh, these are yesses, please.

33:39.981 --> 33:41.098
So, next group.

33:45.463 --> 33:46.817
I'll be right back. Will you hold this?

33:46.841 --> 33:48.331

34:34.380 --> 34:37.214
but we're actually in the
middle of an audition right now.

34:40.398 --> 34:41.966

It doesn't have to go
down like this, Mo.

35:22.442 --> 35:23.908
But it does.

35:27.567 --> 35:28.933
Mo.

35:29.055 --> 35:30.355
I just heard you sing to Eddie,

35:30.380 --> 35:32.284
and I hate to break it to you,

35:32.309 --> 35:34.769
but it didn't sound like
you were anywhere near ready

35:34.794 --> 35:36.277
to break up with him.

35:36.302 --> 35:38.308
Oh, but I am. Too many issues there.

35:38.333 --> 35:39.628
On whose part?

35:39.653 --> 35:41.980
I just think maybe you should
work through the issues

35:42.005 --> 35:43.450
together and try to push through them.

35:43.474 --> 35:46.144
- Oh? Like you did with Max?
- What? That's...

35:46.169 --> 35:47.973
No, no, not having this conversation.
Bye bye now.

35:47.997 --> 35:49.864
- It's not the same thing.
- Mm-mm.

35:57.588 --> 35:59.002
What is happening right now?

35:59.027 --> 36:00.777
I don't know, but I don't like it.

36:01.800 --> 36:03.464
Hey, Zoey.

36:05.234 --> 36:07.292
You have any idea what this is about?

36:07.450 --> 36:09.644
No, but if Joan and Ava want

36:09.669 --> 36:12.308
to talk to all of us together,
it's either about The Chirp,

36:12.333 --> 36:14.675
or it's the first sign
of the apocalypse.

36:15.672 --> 36:17.808
- Zoey.
- Max.

36:23.030 --> 36:24.694
Could everyone please take a seat?

36:24.719 --> 36:26.886
As most of you know over the years,

36:26.922 --> 36:28.955
the 4th and 6th floor have had

36:28.990 --> 36:30.957
their fair share of heated battles.

36:30.982 --> 36:32.982
But these friendly competitions

36:33.007 --> 36:35.832
have only served to divide us
when the truth is,

36:35.857 --> 36:37.580
we are one big team.

36:37.605 --> 36:40.772
So rather than hiding information,

36:40.797 --> 36:43.050
heightening security between floors,

36:43.075 --> 36:45.410
occasionally slipping viruses
into the other team's server...

36:45.434 --> 36:46.666
I didn't know you did that.

36:46.691 --> 36:48.699
But rather than doing
any of those things,

36:48.724 --> 36:50.238
we're gonna make some changes.

36:50.263 --> 36:53.364
From now on, we're all in this together.

36:54.414 --> 36:59.159
♪ Love is but a song we sing ♪

36:59.184 --> 37:03.487
♪ Fear's the way we die ♪

37:05.946 --> 37:10.082
♪ You can make the mountains ring ♪

37:10.360 --> 37:15.196
♪ Or make the angels cry ♪

37:17.835 --> 37:21.724
♪ Though the bird is on the wing ♪

37:21.749 --> 37:26.618
♪ And you may not know why ♪

37:28.861 --> 37:31.074
♪ Come on people now ♪

37:31.099 --> 37:33.099
♪ Smile on your brother ♪

37:33.124 --> 37:34.970
♪ Everybody get together ♪

37:34.995 --> 37:39.798
♪ Try to love one another right now ♪

37:43.139 --> 37:45.324
♪ Come on people now ♪

37:45.349 --> 37:47.027
♪ Smile on your brother ♪

37:47.052 --> 37:49.472
♪ Everybody get together ♪

37:49.497 --> 37:53.839

37:53.864 --> 37:56.355

37:56.380 --> 38:00.850

38:04.455 --> 38:07.980
It's on a hill, overlooking the city.

38:08.566 --> 38:12.753
And that is the sunset
we'll see whenever we visit.

38:12.778 --> 38:16.747
And I arranged to have
a cedar tree planted

38:16.772 --> 38:19.394
right next to him so
there would always be

38:19.419 --> 38:21.917
- shade for visitors.
- It's amazing.

38:21.942 --> 38:24.606
Mom, I didn't even know the cemetery
would allow something like that.

38:24.630 --> 38:28.632
Well, you've got to know
the right people.

38:29.351 --> 38:32.252
Did you happen to decide how
many plots you're gonna get?

38:32.277 --> 38:34.730
I started with two, but good ol' Dale

38:34.755 --> 38:37.449
told me that we did have
the option to extend

38:37.474 --> 38:41.337
and acquire more at a profound discount.

38:41.362 --> 38:44.277
- Hmm...
- Okay, look.

38:44.302 --> 38:46.183
I didn't realize my post-death plan

38:46.208 --> 38:47.443
was gonna get you so upset,

38:47.468 --> 38:50.511
but since I intend
to love you in this life

38:50.536 --> 38:52.753
and whatever comes next,

38:52.778 --> 38:55.045
I'm more than happy if they
sprinkle part of my body

38:55.070 --> 38:56.621
over you and the rest of me in the bay.

38:56.645 --> 38:58.153
How very sweet of you. You're really...

38:58.177 --> 39:00.155
- You're am amazing wife.
- I know.

39:00.227 --> 39:01.988
Proud of you, Mom.

39:02.571 --> 39:04.714
This is a really tough decision to make.

39:04.739 --> 39:07.417
Yeah. It was time, sweetie.

39:07.442 --> 39:10.988
You can only postpone
the inevitable for so long.

39:20.254 --> 39:21.605
Guess what?

39:21.630 --> 39:23.878
I didn't even need to use an
access card to get up here.

39:23.903 --> 39:25.433
The times, they are a-changin'.

39:25.458 --> 39:27.113
What can I help you with, Zoey?

39:29.370 --> 39:30.901
Do you really want to do this?

39:30.926 --> 39:33.761
I'm not doing anything.
I'm just living my life.

39:33.786 --> 39:35.620
I know, but here's the thing...

39:35.645 --> 39:37.912
If Joan and Ava can make up...

39:39.065 --> 39:41.464
Can you just hear me out
for a minute, please?

39:42.355 --> 39:43.788
Sure.

39:44.246 --> 39:46.214
Thank you.

39:47.098 --> 39:52.541
I have spent the last
several days at a cemetery,

39:53.269 --> 39:56.894
and it's made me acutely aware of time,

39:56.919 --> 40:02.022
and how precious it all is.

40:03.431 --> 40:05.363
A year ago...

40:05.972 --> 40:10.261
I never would've imagined this
is where I'd be right now,

40:10.286 --> 40:14.288
which just goes to show
anything can happen.

40:15.623 --> 40:20.597
And if I had to die tomorrow,
I couldn't stomach

40:20.622 --> 40:22.856
being this far apart from you.

40:28.125 --> 40:29.715
You know, I think
I'm getting pretty good

40:29.739 --> 40:32.363
at finding my strength lately,
but it's very hard

40:32.388 --> 40:34.800
to hold my ground when you
play the both the Joan and Ava

40:34.825 --> 40:36.995
and the cemetery cards?

40:38.533 --> 40:40.120
Hey, moments like these,

40:40.145 --> 40:42.722
sometimes you have
to haul out the big guns.

40:44.412 --> 40:46.462
Look, I'm not saying

40:46.487 --> 40:49.363
I expect us to just go back
to the way things were,

40:49.388 --> 40:51.777
but maybe with time...

40:52.042 --> 40:54.902
Somehow get back to...

40:55.538 --> 40:57.805
Whatever we are.

40:58.661 --> 41:00.441
Yeah.

41:00.835 --> 41:03.449
Max. Can I see you?

41:03.769 --> 41:06.074
A manager's work is never done.

41:06.151 --> 41:08.418
But, uh...

41:08.673 --> 41:10.363
I'll talk to you later.

41:18.396 --> 41:19.996
Hey, why are you still here?

41:20.021 --> 41:22.059
I take a great deal of pride
in shutting this place down,

41:22.083 --> 41:23.565
so beat it, already.

41:23.590 --> 41:26.238
I was waiting to talk to you.

41:26.442 --> 41:28.609
Oh. Okay.

41:29.280 --> 41:31.488
You let a fox into the henhouse.

41:32.222 --> 41:34.425
What does that mean?

41:34.450 --> 41:37.316
Turns out Leif has been sending
our code downstairs all week.

41:37.341 --> 41:39.183
That's why we had to end the bake-off.

41:39.208 --> 41:43.136
Wait, are you... Uh, but, uh, no.

41:43.161 --> 41:44.614
What, you thought you could handle him,

41:44.638 --> 41:47.988
even though you knew he had
a history of insubordination?

41:48.339 --> 41:51.347
I can't let someone with that
kind of judgment lead my team.

41:52.078 --> 41:53.550
I'm sorry to inform you

41:53.575 --> 41:57.511
that your services are no
longer required at Sprq Point.

41:58.374 --> 41:59.644
Wait.

42:00.709 --> 42:03.110
- Are you saying that...
- Yes, Maxwell.

42:03.747 --> 42:05.513
You're fired.
