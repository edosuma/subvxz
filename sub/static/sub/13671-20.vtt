00:01.000 --> 00:02.320
 Previously on St Elsewhere -

00:02.320 --> 00:06.240
 I know it was wrong for me to kill
 Peter. I know how special life is.

00:06.240 --> 00:08.880
 You don't remember me. Robin Baskins?

00:08.880 --> 00:10.920
 I was in your graduating class.

00:10.920 --> 00:12.880
 Everybody has me pegged for a jerk.

00:12.880 --> 00:16.079
 Sure, I booted the
 pooch a couple of times,

00:16.079 --> 00:19.320
 but...what's a guy got to do
 around here to get a second chance?

00:19.320 --> 00:21.000
 You want us to buy a hospital?

00:21.000 --> 00:23.320
 A health maintenance
 organisation like yours

00:23.320 --> 00:25.440
 could operate St Eligius
 very profitably.

00:25.440 --> 00:29.440
 Victor...marry me!

02:00.160 --> 02:02.000
 Transport from Framingham.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.880
 Have a couple of orderlies
 unload the wagon. Doctor in charge?

02:04.880 --> 02:08.880
 In there.

02:12.640 --> 02:15.640
 I'm going to prescribe nitro tabs.

02:15.640 --> 02:17.920
 What do I use for dough,
 deposit bottles?

02:17.920 --> 02:21.480
 You don't look like a doctor.
 I want a specialist.

02:21.480 --> 02:24.920
 I'm not budging until
 I see Mark Craig.

02:24.920 --> 02:26.680
 Dr Craig doesn't do ER.

02:26.680 --> 02:29.280
 He will, for Robin Baskins.

02:29.280 --> 02:32.760
 Old friends.
 Classmates, like this.

02:32.760 --> 02:34.520
 Yeah?

02:34.520 --> 02:36.200
 Dr Morrison.
 State police.

02:36.200 --> 02:39.920
 I've got a convict medical
 situation outside from Framingham.

02:39.920 --> 02:41.200
 The woman's prison?

02:41.200 --> 02:44.640
 Right. Sign her in?

02:44.640 --> 02:46.280
 We called ahead.

02:46.280 --> 02:48.080
 Nobody told me. What's the problem?

02:48.080 --> 02:48.920
 Pelvic.

02:48.920 --> 02:49.960
 Pelvic.
 Can you narrow it down?

02:49.960 --> 02:51.600
 You're the doctor.

02:51.600 --> 02:53.160
 Yes, I am.

02:53.160 --> 02:57.160
 Hi, Jack.

02:58.440 --> 03:00.800
 Same old ER.

03:00.800 --> 03:02.520
 I'm gonna kill him!

03:02.520 --> 03:03.800
 Not if you know your medicine(!)

03:03.800 --> 03:05.880
 Listen.
 "Dissolution of marriage

03:05.880 --> 03:09.360
 "- other and further
 relief not to be less than 50%".

03:09.360 --> 03:12.040
 Robert's suing me for
 half my medical degree.

03:12.040 --> 03:13.960
 Your ex is squeezing
 the Gucci, huh?

03:13.960 --> 03:16.040
 He claims he supported me
 through med school,

03:16.040 --> 03:18.520
 so now he's entitled to half
 my future earnings.

03:18.520 --> 03:20.360
 Know a decent lawyer?

03:20.360 --> 03:21.880
 That's a contradiction in terms.

03:21.880 --> 03:24.920
 I thought the two of us would settle
 this like two civilised adults.

03:24.920 --> 03:26.760
 Don't tell me about
 civilised adults.

03:26.760 --> 03:29.520
 I'm on a renal rotation,
 Westphall's home turf.

03:29.520 --> 03:31.280
 He pops me every chance he gets.

03:31.280 --> 03:32.640
 I feel like the only duck

03:32.640 --> 03:35.320
 in his personal shooting gallery.
 I can't win.

03:35.320 --> 03:38.600
 Well, remember the great thing about
 rotation. Eventually, you rotate.

03:38.600 --> 03:40.600
 If I live that long.

03:40.600 --> 03:42.600
 Are you still staying at the Craigs?

03:42.600 --> 03:45.200
 I found somewhere.
 I move in tomorrow.

03:45.200 --> 03:48.000
 Well, I got to find a lawyer.
 See you.

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
 I don't know any Perry Masons, but
 I know some pretty good restaurants.

03:52.240 --> 03:53.960
 Linguini and clams, bottle of vino

03:53.960 --> 03:56.400
 might loosen the capillaries.
 What do you think?

03:56.400 --> 04:00.320
 Smooth move - wait until
 I'm vulnerable, then pounce.

04:00.320 --> 04:01.880
 I said, no dates.

04:01.880 --> 04:03.000
 It's just dinner.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.200
 Forget it!

04:04.200 --> 04:06.960
 Mr Kagan was admitted last
 night complaining of heartburn,

04:06.960 --> 04:10.960
 epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting and
 diaphoresis. In other words, angina.

04:11.720 --> 04:14.440
 EKG is normal. So are the X-rays.

04:14.440 --> 04:17.920
 I've got him on an IV of nitro,
 but his chest pains persist.

04:17.920 --> 04:20.399
 Problem may not be cardiac.

04:20.399 --> 04:22.760
 What if you're looking
 at the wrong system?

04:22.760 --> 04:24.960
 For instance?

04:24.960 --> 04:26.920
 Gall bladder?

04:26.920 --> 04:29.320
 Cystitis can mimic an MI.

04:29.320 --> 04:30.760
 Explain why he's not responding.

04:30.760 --> 04:33.240
 You wouldn't be second
 guessing Fiscus or Ehrlich.

04:33.240 --> 04:35.400
 I'm not second guessing.
 It's a second opinion.

04:35.400 --> 04:37.840
 I'm your supervisor.
 I gave you my objective take.

04:37.840 --> 04:39.680
 You're not objective
 where I'm concerned.

04:39.680 --> 04:41.360
 Oh! What is that supposed to mean?

04:41.360 --> 04:42.960
 You're still mad about Arthur Tibbit.

04:42.960 --> 04:45.080
 No, although I asked you
 to discharge the man...

04:45.080 --> 04:47.560
 Since I was a med
 student, you've had an attitude.

04:47.560 --> 04:48.080
 You're the one with the problem.

04:48.080 --> 04:49.880
 You're the one with the problem.
 You're so convinced you're right.

04:49.880 --> 04:51.240
 Well, prove me wrong.

04:51.240 --> 04:51.720
 I will.

04:51.720 --> 04:52.800
 I will.
 Fine!

04:52.800 --> 04:55.800
 Dream on.

04:55.800 --> 04:59.520
 So it's finalised, City sold the
 hospital to Magna-Fujiama inc.

04:59.520 --> 05:03.000
 Let's hope they're not
 located down the river.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.080
 Wonder when the new
 owners are gonna show up.

05:05.080 --> 05:09.080
 I'm anxious to meet this mysterious
 health maintenance organisation.

05:09.160 --> 05:12.720
 I have some swampland on marsh
 field I'm trying to unload.

05:12.720 --> 05:15.000
 Mark's the only one that's
 spoken with him, right?

05:15.000 --> 05:17.240
 Yeah. We ought to have a
 blue ribbon ceremony

05:17.240 --> 05:18.760
 when this place changes hands.

05:18.760 --> 05:21.880
 I have some bathtub gin I've
 been saving for a special occasion.

05:21.880 --> 05:25.200
 Speaking of which, Shirley Daniels
 turned up this morning on schedule.

05:25.200 --> 05:26.760
 I know. We agreed to treat her,

05:26.760 --> 05:29.240
 but let's keep this thing
 low profile, in and out.

05:29.240 --> 05:30.680
 Mum's the word.

05:30.680 --> 05:34.320
 No bear claws?
 Call yourself a nursing staff!

05:34.320 --> 05:35.720
 Victor, have you seen my husband?

05:35.720 --> 05:38.360
 No, but Mrs Craig, you're
 looking delicious today.

05:38.360 --> 05:39.760
 We're supposed to have lunch.

05:39.760 --> 05:41.800
 If you do see Dr Craig,
 I'll be in his office.

05:41.800 --> 05:45.800
 I'll tell him.

05:45.960 --> 05:48.440
 Victor! Heard about you and Lucy.
 Congratulations.

05:48.440 --> 05:49.440
 Whatever you heard, it's not true.

05:49.440 --> 05:51.520
 Whatever you heard, it's not true.
 Come on, getting married? Golly.

05:51.520 --> 05:53.200
 Nice colour.
 Did you go scuba-diving?

05:53.200 --> 05:55.720
 We are not husband and wife.
 No esposa.

05:55.720 --> 05:58.480
 Oh, come on.
 Don't you try to stonewall me!

05:58.480 --> 06:02.480
 Know who just got admitted to the
 hospital? You'll never guess.

06:02.560 --> 06:06.560
 Shirley Daniels. Real scoop, Elliot.
 Excuse me.

06:11.480 --> 06:12.600
 Shirley Daniels.

06:12.600 --> 06:12.880
 So?

06:12.880 --> 06:14.920
 So?
 You know, Shirley Daniels.

06:14.920 --> 06:16.800
 She shot Peter White.

06:16.800 --> 06:20.800
 Shirley Daniels...Peter White...

06:20.960 --> 06:23.720
 Never mind.

06:23.720 --> 06:27.600
 It cost us a lot of money to find
 out you have chronic stable angina.

06:27.600 --> 06:29.640
 I told you.

06:29.640 --> 06:33.280
 After I ran the tests.
 Ever since that night,

06:33.280 --> 06:35.840
 I've been half expecting you
 to show up with your hand out.

06:35.840 --> 06:39.840
 You meet such interesting people in
 the city jail. Real cross-section.

06:40.920 --> 06:43.400
 The other doctor already
 gave me a nitro prescription.

06:43.400 --> 06:47.000
 That's for a lice bath and
 a clean set of clothes.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.040
 First floor, delousing.

06:49.040 --> 06:51.760
 Exterminate some of the
 urban wildlife

06:51.760 --> 06:54.240
 who've made you their personal park.

06:54.240 --> 06:57.440
 All you really need is a decent
 diet and a clean place to live.

06:57.440 --> 06:59.680
 Start taking multis with your meals.

06:59.680 --> 07:03.040
 Oh, sure.
 Maybe I'll join a health club(!)

07:03.040 --> 07:05.120
 Everyone goes through hard times.

07:05.120 --> 07:08.360
 Stop sucking on the nipple.
 Pull yourself together.

07:08.360 --> 07:10.400
 You're a disgrace to Sigma Chi.

07:10.400 --> 07:12.000
 Here. Buy yourself some vitamins.

07:12.000 --> 07:12.920
 Thanks, Mark.

07:12.920 --> 07:15.280
 Thanks, Mark.
 Wunderkind, schmunderkind.

07:15.280 --> 07:19.280
 Abdominal pain in the
 right lower quad, temp 100.1.

07:19.320 --> 07:22.320
 White count over 11,000.

07:22.320 --> 07:25.400
 Let's get another CBC.

07:25.400 --> 07:27.200
 And an electrolyte panel.

07:27.200 --> 07:30.960
 You lost your appendix
 two years ago.

07:30.960 --> 07:34.520
 I'd say this has all the
 earmarks of an ectopic pregnancy.

07:34.520 --> 07:38.120
 18 months in prison, nothing
 but female cons for miles.

07:38.120 --> 07:40.520
 Your diagnostic talent
 is a bust, Boomer.

07:40.520 --> 07:41.560
 Right, well,

07:41.560 --> 07:44.400
 we'll get you upstairs and
 find out what the problem is.

07:44.400 --> 07:48.320
 Take your time.

07:48.320 --> 07:52.320
 I'm in no hurry to go back.

07:54.960 --> 07:58.720
 You're in a lot of pain, huh?

07:58.720 --> 08:02.720
 No. I'm home.

08:03.960 --> 08:07.920
 Do you have the results of the scan
 I ordered for Mr Kagan?

08:07.920 --> 08:11.240
 Just came in.

08:11.240 --> 08:15.240
 Let's see...yeah, looks like
 we were on the right track.

08:15.760 --> 08:18.800
 I'm gonna need a liver panel,
 and set up an ultrasound, would you?

08:18.800 --> 08:22.800
 OK. Did you notice how
 tanned Victor and Lucy are?

08:23.240 --> 08:26.160
 Yeah, I figured they'd been basking
 on the neon beach,

08:26.160 --> 08:28.280
 trying to catch
 some artificial rays.

08:28.280 --> 08:30.440
 Those golden tones don't
 come from a sun lamp.

08:30.440 --> 08:32.360
 Remember last
 week when they were gone?

08:32.360 --> 08:35.080
 She said she was in Portsmouth,
 he said he was in Providence,

08:35.080 --> 08:37.080
 and they both came
 back as brown as berries.

08:37.080 --> 08:39.280
 Rumour has it they were in Cozumel.

08:39.280 --> 08:42.039
 Mexico? Why?

08:42.039 --> 08:45.280
 They eloped.

08:45.280 --> 08:48.680
 Tired, sore,
 and I've got to get back to work.

08:48.680 --> 08:50.360
 What do you do, Mr Costa?

08:50.360 --> 08:51.400
 Fisherman.

08:51.400 --> 08:54.200
 Got my own boat, but no health plan.

08:54.200 --> 08:56.760
 I'd appreciate it if you
 don't jack up my bill.

08:56.760 --> 08:57.680
 You sore here?

08:57.680 --> 08:59.640
 You sore here?
 Yeah.

08:59.640 --> 09:02.760
 I fish every day of the year,
 weather permitting.

09:02.760 --> 09:04.520
 Except Good Friday.

09:04.520 --> 09:08.480
 Here?

09:08.480 --> 09:10.680
 What kind of schooner is she?

09:10.680 --> 09:12.760
 45ft, western rig.

09:12.760 --> 09:14.920
 I call her O Novo Mundo.

09:14.920 --> 09:16.960
 The New World.

09:16.960 --> 09:19.400
 Came here from
 Portugal when I was four.

09:19.400 --> 09:21.200
 Worked for my dad.

09:21.200 --> 09:24.800
 He taught me to read the
 sky and look for signs.

09:24.800 --> 09:27.800
 Sounds like what I try to do.
 You may have a kidney infection.

09:27.800 --> 09:31.800
 I'm going to start you on
 gentamicin, an antibiotic.

09:31.920 --> 09:34.480
 You gonna
 order a lot of expensive tests?

09:34.480 --> 09:35.480
 Not if I don't have to.

09:35.480 --> 09:36.960
 Not if I don't have to.
 Good.

09:36.960 --> 09:40.600
 My feeling is we can get this
 cleared up quick and simple.

09:40.600 --> 09:42.880
 I trust a man who
 trusts his instincts.

09:42.880 --> 09:46.000
 You got strong hands too.
 Could have been a fisherman.

09:46.000 --> 09:50.000
 Some days I wish I was.

10:02.280 --> 10:06.280
 Couldn't lie there
 watching her suffer.

10:07.480 --> 10:09.200
 How are you feeling, Shirley?

10:09.200 --> 10:13.160
 Little dopey. Never been on this
 end of a Demerol depth charge before.

10:13.160 --> 10:14.960
 I talked to Dr Turner.

10:14.960 --> 10:16.880
 She told me your ectopic pregnancy

10:16.880 --> 10:20.040
 turned out to be nothing more than a
 ruptured follicle cyst,

10:20.040 --> 10:22.800
 so a little bed rest, you'll
 be back to your old self.

10:22.800 --> 10:25.920
 And my old cell.

10:25.920 --> 10:29.040
 I can't imagine what
 your life is like.

10:29.040 --> 10:33.040
 Prison's not like
 an Ida Lupino movie.

10:33.120 --> 10:35.360
 Most of the women aren't animals.

10:35.360 --> 10:37.080
 It's really not so bad.

10:37.080 --> 10:39.000
 They let me work in the clinic
 sometimes.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.800
 One teenage girl in prison when she
 was seven months pregnant -

10:41.800 --> 10:42.840
 I delivered her baby.

10:42.840 --> 10:45.480
 I was afraid you'd have
 become cynical and hard,

10:45.480 --> 10:47.520
 but you're glowing.

10:47.520 --> 10:49.480
 I'm glad to be back.

10:49.480 --> 10:52.080
 St Eligius's institutional
 brown never looked better.

10:52.080 --> 10:55.080
 There are some regrets?

10:55.080 --> 10:57.120
 My only regret about shooting
 Peter White

10:57.120 --> 11:01.120
 is that he didn't suffer enough.

11:03.160 --> 11:07.160
 She probably never hurt anyone in
 her life, but she's dying slowly,

11:08.000 --> 11:10.160
 and in pain.

11:10.160 --> 11:14.160
 World isn't fair, Helen.

11:15.440 --> 11:18.960
 Someone should put
 her out of her misery.

11:18.960 --> 11:22.800
 Well, if you want anything,
 I'm here all day.

11:22.800 --> 11:26.280
 Thanks, but what I need,
 you can't send through the mail.

11:26.280 --> 11:29.080
 But you can tell
 McIlroy the Magnificent

11:29.080 --> 11:31.000
 I have to use the facilities.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.600
 You should appreciate what a
 privilege it is

11:33.600 --> 11:37.560
 to get up and walk down the hall.

11:37.560 --> 11:40.160
 When's the old gang
 coming by to visit me?

11:40.160 --> 11:44.160
 I'll put the word out.

11:50.200 --> 11:52.280
 Sorry about lunch.

11:52.280 --> 11:53.520
 Just as well, though.

11:53.520 --> 11:57.360
 That stuff on the steam table gets
 pretty crusty at this time of day.

11:57.360 --> 12:01.040
 Don't wait for dinner. I'm expecting
 a call from Magna-Fujiama.

12:01.040 --> 12:05.040
 Fine. See you tonight.

12:07.760 --> 12:11.760
 Ellen? Ellen! >

12:13.360 --> 12:17.360
 Ellen Harper.
 Prettiest girl at Penn.

12:20.400 --> 12:24.400
 Hello, Robin.

12:30.760 --> 12:33.080
 Helen, I'm putting Mr Kagan
 in 3316 down

12:33.080 --> 12:36.680
 for a pyrophosphate scan and an
 angiogram. Would you set me up?

12:36.680 --> 12:40.160
 Yeah, but Dr Chandler has him
 scheduled for sonar at six.

12:40.160 --> 12:41.840
 Yes, I see that.

12:41.840 --> 12:44.160
 Try for me earlier,
 beat him with the punch?

12:44.160 --> 12:48.160
 Do my best.

12:49.840 --> 12:53.720
 Come in. >

12:53.720 --> 12:55.160
 You wanted to see me?

12:55.160 --> 12:59.160
 Mmm. Sit down.

13:02.440 --> 13:04.160
 Joseph Costa.

13:04.160 --> 13:06.520
 You gentamicin dosage is
 too low for a man his size.

13:06.520 --> 13:08.680
 He should be on 80
 milligrams IV every eight hours.

13:08.680 --> 13:10.280
 I know that.
 His blood tests showed

13:10.280 --> 13:13.160
 an abnormal level of creatinine.
 I thought we should dosage down

13:13.160 --> 13:14.960
 for now and avoid risking
 side-effects.

13:14.960 --> 13:17.640
 That's exactly why we have tests.
 Why didn't you order them?

13:17.640 --> 13:20.320
 Mr Costa has no insurance. I don't
 want to increase his bill.

13:20.320 --> 13:23.840
 The patient's physical, not
 fiscal well-being is your concern.

13:23.840 --> 13:26.480
 By not spending the money,
 you're short-changing his care.

13:26.480 --> 13:28.800
 I feel this is
 the right course of treatment.

13:28.800 --> 13:31.440
 Mr Costa has a minor kidney
 infection which we can clear up.

13:31.440 --> 13:33.840
 You're hardly in a
 position to play hunches.

13:33.840 --> 13:36.960
 I want his medication brought
 up to standard levels,

13:36.960 --> 13:38.360
 and do a peak and trough.

13:38.360 --> 13:39.640
 If you say so.

13:39.640 --> 13:43.640
 I say so.

13:48.360 --> 13:52.360
 Oh, my God, I forgot the coffee pot!

13:52.720 --> 13:54.880
 A little distracted, are we?

13:54.880 --> 13:56.240
 Yeah, I guess.

13:56.240 --> 13:59.400
 Heard you had quite a honeymoon.

13:59.400 --> 14:01.560
 Mariachis in the moonlight?

14:01.560 --> 14:03.960
 Still got that dreamy look in
 your eye.

14:03.960 --> 14:07.640
 Don't be ridiculous. I don't know
 how these stories get started.

14:07.640 --> 14:10.640
 OK, OK.
 Where's Kagan's chart?

14:10.640 --> 14:12.640
 Did you check the chart wheel?

14:12.640 --> 14:13.800
 Yeah, couldn't find it.

14:13.800 --> 14:17.800
 It's right here, right under...oh!

14:19.640 --> 14:21.760
 I guess I had it under C
 instead of K for Kagan.

14:21.760 --> 14:24.360
 I heard the snorkelling
 was great down there.

14:24.360 --> 14:27.840
 Phil, we didn't get married!

14:27.840 --> 14:31.200
 No, I'm happy for you, Lucy.
 Really, I am.

14:31.200 --> 14:33.320
 Let's see. Liver panel came up high.

14:33.320 --> 14:35.960
 Probably an obstruction
 of the cystic duct.

14:35.960 --> 14:37.600
 Novino has him down for an angiogram.

14:37.600 --> 14:38.840
 he's not doing real well.

14:38.840 --> 14:40.840
 Give me an ultrasound right away.

14:40.840 --> 14:42.200
 Angiogram later?

14:42.200 --> 14:43.000
 Thank you.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.640
 Thank you.
 Who is this guy anyway?

14:44.640 --> 14:47.200
 Just a patient who needs an
 accurate diagnosis,

14:47.200 --> 14:51.200
 which is what he's not getting
 from Novino.

14:54.240 --> 14:55.280
 It isn't bad.

14:55.280 --> 14:59.280
 I hear the soup kitchen on
 46th Street in New York is tops.

15:01.520 --> 15:04.360
 All the fancy places
 send their leftovers.

15:04.360 --> 15:08.360
 Tough to get a table.
 Desserts might be a trifle rich.

15:08.400 --> 15:10.520
 Robin, how did we end up here?

15:10.520 --> 15:12.400
 Best in Boston.

15:12.400 --> 15:15.560
 No, I mean, what happened to you?

15:15.560 --> 15:19.160
 Oh, that.

15:19.160 --> 15:20.440
 I got greedy.

15:20.440 --> 15:23.040
 You've heard of
 this Busky character?

15:23.040 --> 15:25.120
 On Wall Street?

15:25.120 --> 15:27.760
 Insider trading deal.

15:27.760 --> 15:30.800
 I pulled a stunt
 like he did years ago.

15:30.800 --> 15:33.240
 I had a successful brokerage firm,

15:33.240 --> 15:37.240
 handled hostile takeover bids,
 collected huge commissions.

15:37.760 --> 15:41.760
 Spread a little money around,
 got some inside dope.

15:42.600 --> 15:45.760
 The SEC called it bribery.

15:45.760 --> 15:49.120
 Oh, my God.

15:49.120 --> 15:51.000
 I lost the business.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.880
 My wife left me.

15:52.880 --> 15:55.480
 Couldn't get work, drifted around,
 started to drink.

15:55.480 --> 15:58.280
 Most of the men here
 have the same story.

15:58.280 --> 16:00.520
 But you're an exception
 to fall so far.

16:00.520 --> 16:03.360
 It could happen to anyone.

16:03.360 --> 16:07.040
 I'm proof.

16:07.040 --> 16:10.880
 What about you, prettiest girl?

16:10.880 --> 16:14.880
 After Candace Burgen.

16:16.080 --> 16:18.280
 In my opinion,

16:18.280 --> 16:22.280
 you made Candace look
 like Charlie McCarthy.

16:22.720 --> 16:26.720
 You know I broke up with
 Mark three times that summer.

16:27.280 --> 16:31.280
 He's always been convinced
 that you were the cause.

16:33.240 --> 16:36.440
 Now that I think of it,
 maybe you were.

16:36.440 --> 16:40.440
 Ever wonder what
 might have happened?

16:42.120 --> 16:46.120
 Yes.

16:50.440 --> 16:51.480
 Oh, Dr Kiem.

16:51.480 --> 16:53.200
 Philip, what can I do for you?

16:53.200 --> 16:55.120
 I got this patient, John Kagan.

16:55.120 --> 16:57.240
 Ultrasound shows he's
 got a bagful of stones.

16:57.240 --> 16:59.640
 He's febrile, acute cholecystitis.

16:59.640 --> 17:01.160
 He needs a cholecystectomy.

17:01.160 --> 17:02.720
 Then schedule surgery.

17:02.720 --> 17:05.440
 I want to, but it's short
 notice and no one's available.

17:05.440 --> 17:06.760
 Could you do the honours?

17:06.760 --> 17:08.319
 Of course. How's tomorrow morning?

17:08.319 --> 17:10.359
 Great.

17:10.359 --> 17:11.400
 I can do that.

17:11.400 --> 17:12.480
 It's my job.

17:12.480 --> 17:14.359
 Thank for springing me, Boomer.

17:14.359 --> 17:16.800
 I thought you might
 appreciate a change of scene.

17:16.800 --> 17:17.920
 Hey, how's Pete?

17:17.920 --> 17:19.720
 He's great, he's big.

17:19.720 --> 17:22.119
 He's really grown up.
 Did you know I remarried?

17:22.119 --> 17:23.960
 Yeah? That's wonderful.

17:23.960 --> 17:27.160
 Her name's Joanne.
 We knew each other in Seattle.

17:27.160 --> 17:28.880
 Shirley!

17:28.880 --> 17:29.960
 Hi.

17:29.960 --> 17:31.920
 Oh, a party!
 Jack, I'm touched!

17:31.920 --> 17:32.960
 Elliot!

17:32.960 --> 17:34.000
 Hi.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.040
 Ehrlich!

17:35.040 --> 17:36.360
 Welcome back.

17:36.360 --> 17:37.960
 Glad to see you!

17:37.960 --> 17:40.120
 You look good.
 You dropped some weight?

17:40.120 --> 17:44.120
 Um, yeah. No.

17:44.400 --> 17:46.160
 I...I got to go.

17:46.160 --> 17:49.760
 Hi.

17:49.760 --> 17:53.760
 Hi, Lucy.
 So, you two tied the knot?

17:54.960 --> 17:57.080
 Now, why would I
 want to marry Victor?

17:57.080 --> 17:59.200
 Half the time,
 I want to drop-kick him.

17:59.200 --> 18:03.200
 Watch it, killer!

18:04.280 --> 18:07.240
 What I mean is, Shirley knows
 the real me. We used to date.

18:07.240 --> 18:09.240
 We went out once.

18:09.240 --> 18:11.320
 Not even that.

18:11.320 --> 18:13.480
 We ended up going out
 for dinner, remember?

18:13.480 --> 18:17.480
 Wayne.

18:20.760 --> 18:24.600
 On the cheek?

18:24.600 --> 18:26.040
 Show her your scar.

18:26.040 --> 18:27.160
 What scar?

18:27.160 --> 18:28.240
 No big deal.

18:28.240 --> 18:29.760
  THUNDER CRASHES

18:29.760 --> 18:33.120
 Ix-nay on the ooting-shay.

18:33.120 --> 18:37.080
 Ah, raining, finally.

18:37.080 --> 18:40.000
 Cut the cake.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.360
 Oh, Boston cream.

18:42.360 --> 18:46.360
 My favourite.

18:47.880 --> 18:48.920
 What's this?

18:48.920 --> 18:52.920
 My idea.

18:53.680 --> 18:55.480
 Always in good taste(!)

18:55.480 --> 18:57.120
 That's pretty funny.

18:57.120 --> 18:58.600
 Who's this from?

18:58.600 --> 19:02.600
 Not me.

19:10.760 --> 19:13.240
 Whose idea was this?

19:13.240 --> 19:15.080
 Oh, jeez.

19:15.080 --> 19:16.160
 Oh.

19:16.160 --> 19:20.040
 Let's party(!) I'll do prison tricks.

19:20.040 --> 19:22.920
 That's why you're all here, right?

19:22.920 --> 19:25.280
 To gawk at the jailbird?

19:25.280 --> 19:27.640
 Harry Houdini, slipping shackles.

19:27.640 --> 19:31.640
 Stop.

19:32.400 --> 19:36.400
 I'm a little rusty on
 my escape artist act.

19:38.560 --> 19:41.600
 My friends.

19:41.600 --> 19:43.280
 My good buds.

19:43.280 --> 19:47.280
 Colleagues. Pals.
 Haven't heard word one

19:48.480 --> 19:52.480
 from any of you creeps in 18 months.

20:03.040 --> 20:07.040
 Oh, hi. It's starting
 to come down like pitchforks.

20:08.560 --> 20:10.400
 Did you get my note?

20:10.400 --> 20:14.400
 What on earth were you doing at
 Jesus Light of the World Mission?

20:14.720 --> 20:16.360
 Having dinner.

20:16.360 --> 20:20.360
 I wanted to see how
 the homeless cope,
 especially now that winter's coming.

20:22.160 --> 20:25.640
 I should take you to ER, have your
 stomach pumped, then up to the sixth

20:25.640 --> 20:28.200
 floor for a psych consult.

20:28.200 --> 20:32.200
 I'm going to volunteer one
 day a week at the mission.

20:35.240 --> 20:38.840
 What's all this
 sudden interest in indigence?

20:38.840 --> 20:41.120
 Robin Baskins invited me.

20:41.120 --> 20:44.160
 I thought it was
 something like that!

20:44.160 --> 20:47.080
 We're privileged. We're fortunate.

20:47.080 --> 20:48.640
 We should give.

20:48.640 --> 20:50.520
 There but for the grace of God...

20:50.520 --> 20:52.160
 Oh! Speak for yourself.

20:52.160 --> 20:55.680
 No way I'd ever end up like Baskins.

20:55.680 --> 20:57.520
 Anybody can have bad luck.

20:57.520 --> 21:00.200
 Bad luck doesn't make you a bum!

21:00.200 --> 21:04.000
 That takes a fundamental
 character defect.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.440
 Don't be judgmental.

21:05.440 --> 21:08.320
 I don't know what you
 ever saw in him anyway.

21:08.320 --> 21:12.320
 Mark, he could teach you things
 about kindness and charity...

21:12.680 --> 21:15.640
 Oh, brother, spare me!

21:15.640 --> 21:17.720
 Mark,

21:17.720 --> 21:20.600
 I had a beautiful experience tonight,

21:20.600 --> 21:24.600
 and nothing you can say
 will spoil my mood.

21:27.720 --> 21:30.120
 Oh, great!

21:30.120 --> 21:34.120
 Next, you'll be joining the
 Little Sisters of the Poor!

21:34.960 --> 21:38.960
  KNOCK AT DOOR

21:48.920 --> 21:51.120
 This may be soggy, but
 I'm sure the wine's fine.

21:51.120 --> 21:54.320
 You look like a drowned puppy.

21:54.320 --> 21:57.800
 I planned a spliffier presentation,
 geared more towards

21:57.800 --> 21:59.520
 sweeping you off your feet.

21:59.520 --> 22:01.360
 Conciliatory dinner.

22:01.360 --> 22:03.480
 Even bought a new tie.

22:03.480 --> 22:07.480
 You got a towel?

22:08.280 --> 22:12.280
 Come on in.

22:15.800 --> 22:19.800
 Try to drip in one place.

22:21.960 --> 22:24.200
 Why is this so late?

22:24.200 --> 22:27.440
 Chandler bumped it. You two
 should get your signals straight.

22:27.440 --> 22:29.160
 Lucy, have you a plastic bag?

22:29.160 --> 22:30.080
 It's pouring out there.

22:30.080 --> 22:31.120
 It's pouring out there.
 Yes.

22:31.120 --> 22:34.120
 Dr Kiem, I know you're on
 your way out, but would you

22:34.120 --> 22:38.120
 mind taking a glance at this angio?

22:38.240 --> 22:40.760
 These look like high
 grade obstructions.

22:40.760 --> 22:42.400
 Severe coronary artery disease.

22:42.400 --> 22:45.160
 What are you going to do?

22:45.160 --> 22:48.000
 Well, Mr Kagan is still
 experiencing unstable angina.

22:48.000 --> 22:52.000
 He's probably going to
 need an emergency bypass.

22:53.680 --> 22:55.840
 What's the name of your patient?

22:55.840 --> 22:56.760
 Kagan.

22:56.760 --> 22:57.800
 Kagan.
 John Kagan?

22:57.800 --> 22:59.560
 Yes.

22:59.560 --> 23:03.560
 I'm operating on him tomorrow
 morning for cholecystitis.

23:04.080 --> 23:08.080
 What's going on?

23:41.120 --> 23:45.120
 You're a little late.
 She's a surfboard now.

23:54.280 --> 23:58.280
 All set for another day of renal?

23:58.440 --> 24:01.080
 Westphall's still busting my chops.

24:01.080 --> 24:03.600
 Seth, you slept with his daughter.

24:03.600 --> 24:05.560
 I might act the same way if I knew my

24:05.560 --> 24:08.240
 baby girl had a one-nighter
 with a guy who didn't care.

24:08.240 --> 24:11.200
 That's Westphall's version.
 I like Liz.

24:11.200 --> 24:12.520
 I didn't know who she was.

24:12.520 --> 24:14.840
 I wouldn't have gone to bed
 with her if I'd known.

24:14.840 --> 24:18.840
 You are such a piece of work.

24:19.960 --> 24:22.080
 Yeah, I know.

24:22.080 --> 24:24.520
 But I'm through with first-name sex.

24:24.520 --> 24:28.520
 From now on, only with
 people I care about.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.360
 Still got Robert's picture out, huh?

24:37.360 --> 24:39.320
 I don't want to deny my marriage.

24:39.320 --> 24:43.320
 It's an important part of my life.

24:44.320 --> 24:47.160
 I'll give you a lift to work.

24:47.160 --> 24:49.160
 No, thanks. I'll take my own car.

24:49.160 --> 24:51.280
 I don't want to be dependent
 on you for a ride home.

24:51.280 --> 24:52.320
 It's no problem.

24:52.320 --> 24:56.320
 I'd rather people
 didn't see us show up together,

24:56.400 --> 24:58.360
 and I'd appreciate you not
 telling anyone.

24:58.360 --> 25:00.320
 Come on.

25:00.320 --> 25:04.320
 I don't want to end up on
 your concubine printout.

25:05.120 --> 25:09.000
 Jackie...

25:09.000 --> 25:11.320
 I'm Mr Discretion. I never talk.

25:11.320 --> 25:13.960
 Sure.

25:13.960 --> 25:17.960
 Correct me if I'm wrong, but...I
 thought we synergised last night.

25:19.200 --> 25:20.880
 I didn't sleep well.

25:20.880 --> 25:24.880
 Well, you never do
 with...a new person.

25:26.360 --> 25:28.800
 I was thinking about all
 the women you'd been with,

25:28.800 --> 25:30.440
 and the men they've been with.

25:30.440 --> 25:33.800
 About sex and AIDS,

25:33.800 --> 25:37.800
 how it's not a wonderful
 world to be suddenly single in,

25:37.960 --> 25:41.960
 and how before last night, I
 never slept with anyone but Robert.

25:42.480 --> 25:45.200
 You're kidding?

25:45.200 --> 25:49.200
 I told you.
 We're high-school sweethearts.

25:49.240 --> 25:52.040
 Yeah, I know, but you
 didn't date other people?

25:52.040 --> 25:53.680
 Didn't fool around?

25:53.680 --> 25:57.680
 Nope.   I'm a very faithful person.

26:02.880 --> 26:04.400
 We like that.

26:04.400 --> 26:06.480
 That's good stuff.

26:06.480 --> 26:07.560
  KNOCK AT DOOR

26:07.560 --> 26:11.560
 OK. I'll be right back.

26:15.920 --> 26:17.680
 Robin, good morning.

26:17.680 --> 26:19.640
 Hi. The rain's slowing down.

26:19.640 --> 26:23.640
 Come on in.
 Close the door behind you.

26:26.200 --> 26:30.120
 It's not every day I have
 an employment opportunity.

26:30.120 --> 26:32.280
 That's quite a hike
 from the bus stop.

26:32.280 --> 26:34.040
 Yes.

26:34.040 --> 26:35.800
 So, this is Barbara.

26:35.800 --> 26:36.960
 Yes.

26:36.960 --> 26:38.440
  BABY CRIES

26:38.440 --> 26:42.440
 Oh! Oh-ho-ho-ho.
 Honey, it's OK, Barbara.

26:43.960 --> 26:46.040
 Shh. It's OK.

26:46.040 --> 26:48.480
 I got a way with kids.

26:48.480 --> 26:50.400
 I'm so glad I ran into you yesterday.

26:50.400 --> 26:53.280
 There are all kinds of odds
 and ends around here to do.

26:53.280 --> 26:55.440
 It was no accident.

26:55.440 --> 26:57.360
 I went to St Eligius to find you.

26:57.360 --> 27:00.000
 Why?

27:00.000 --> 27:04.000
 Ever since the night you bailed Mark
 out of jail, you've been on my mind.

27:06.480 --> 27:09.360
 So, now I've made the baby cry,
 what else can I do for you?

27:09.360 --> 27:13.360
 Er...let's see...you can

27:14.200 --> 27:18.200
 start right there.

27:20.720 --> 27:22.040
 Hear about Shirley Daniels?

27:22.040 --> 27:23.440
 Hear about Shirley Daniels?
 She killed her room-mate.

27:23.440 --> 27:24.600
 How did you know?

27:24.600 --> 27:25.800
 I have my sources.

27:25.800 --> 27:27.880
 You're so out of touch,
 by the time you hear,

27:27.880 --> 27:30.960
 it's flashing on the Goodyear blimp.
 Boomer, we're laying odds.

27:30.960 --> 27:32.680
 She didn't do it.

27:32.680 --> 27:34.760
 Smart money's on guilty, 5-1.

27:34.760 --> 27:35.880
 No way.

27:35.880 --> 27:37.960
 We found her standing over the body.

27:37.960 --> 27:39.200
 You did?

27:39.200 --> 27:42.120
 Plus, she told Rosenthal to
 pull the plug on the old lady.

27:42.120 --> 27:45.640
 Where would Shirley get her hands
 on a syringe? Not to mention the...

27:45.640 --> 27:46.720
 somebody help me...the...

27:46.720 --> 27:47.840
 Potassium chloride.

27:47.840 --> 27:49.000
 Right.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.560
 Elementary, my dear Watson.

27:50.560 --> 27:53.320
 Surely Shirley knows her
 way around a medicine cabinet.

27:53.320 --> 27:55.000
 You're missing one clue.

27:55.000 --> 27:56.600
 How so?

27:56.600 --> 28:00.600
 We all know that
 Shirley's forte is a 44.

28:01.240 --> 28:05.160
 Cancelling each other's
 orders, competing for resources.

28:05.160 --> 28:08.320
 This is not the hundred yard dash.

28:08.320 --> 28:10.880
 You don't get a ribbon for
 coming in ahead of the other guy.

28:10.880 --> 28:12.640
 But I was right about
 the cholecystitis.

28:12.640 --> 28:14.280
 But I was right about
 the cholecystitis.
 And I was right about his heart.

28:14.280 --> 28:17.840
 The point is to share
 information, not guard it.

28:17.840 --> 28:21.840
 And by not taking Dr Novino's
 diagnosis seriously, you could have

28:22.200 --> 28:24.440
 jeopardised a patient's life.

28:24.440 --> 28:26.680
 And exposed me to
 a malpractice suit.

28:26.680 --> 28:28.720
 What about Mr Kagan?

28:28.720 --> 28:32.080
 He needs a simple drainage
 as soon as possible.

28:32.080 --> 28:35.080
 What he needs
 is his gall bladder removed.

28:35.080 --> 28:37.560
 Shouldn't we deal
 with his heart first?

28:37.560 --> 28:39.440
 Even a minor procedure is risky for

28:39.440 --> 28:41.560
 a man with his
 acute coronary ischaemia.

28:41.560 --> 28:45.480
 The infection is one of
 the stresses upon his heart.

28:45.480 --> 28:49.480
 Once it's drained,
 his disease will be more manageable.

28:50.560 --> 28:54.560
 We have no choice.

28:54.640 --> 28:57.440
 Last night during the murder,
 you didn't see anything?

28:57.440 --> 28:58.960
 Last night during the murder,
 you didn't see anything?
 No.

28:58.960 --> 29:00.080
 Did you hear anything?

29:00.080 --> 29:01.960
 Detective, I told you. I was asleep.

29:01.960 --> 29:05.200
 I woke up when she coded
 and the alarm went off.

29:05.200 --> 29:08.080
 I got out of bed, went to see
 if there was anything I could do.

29:08.080 --> 29:09.480
 Why?

29:09.480 --> 29:10.920
 Habit. I'm a nurse.

29:10.920 --> 29:14.440
 Were a nurse. What did you do then?

29:14.440 --> 29:16.240
 She was already dead.

29:16.240 --> 29:19.720
 She'd been hanging by a thread
 in the first place. I'm glad for her.

29:19.720 --> 29:20.960
 Anything else?

29:20.960 --> 29:22.400
 Not that I can think of.

29:22.400 --> 29:26.400
 Well, I guess we know
 where to find you.

29:26.960 --> 29:30.960
 Dr Auschlander? Now I know what it
 takes for you to come by and visit.

29:35.120 --> 29:37.920
 Oh, Robin, you're a gem!

29:37.920 --> 29:39.560
 Mark bought that kit

29:39.560 --> 29:42.920
 last summer, and I've been after
 him for weeks to put it together.

29:42.920 --> 29:44.560
 It's a pleasure.

29:44.560 --> 29:48.240
 I used to build
 things for my daughter.

29:48.240 --> 29:50.840
 You didn't tell me you had children.

29:50.840 --> 29:52.800
 Oh, just...Julia.

29:52.800 --> 29:55.440
 My wife took her when the
 house of cards collapsed.

29:55.440 --> 29:56.760
 I haven't seen her since.

29:56.760 --> 30:00.120
 Where are they?

30:00.120 --> 30:01.760
 No idea.

30:01.760 --> 30:04.480
 We don't keep in touch.

30:04.480 --> 30:07.400
 Oh...

30:07.400 --> 30:10.400
 Thanks, Mrs Craig.
 It's been a life-saver bunking here.

30:10.400 --> 30:12.120
 You're certainly welcome.

30:12.120 --> 30:13.840
 I hope your new place works out.

30:13.840 --> 30:15.360
 It should.

30:15.360 --> 30:16.920
 That's gorgeous.

30:16.920 --> 30:18.560
 Nifty joints and grooves.

30:18.560 --> 30:19.960
 Thanks.

30:19.960 --> 30:23.960
 I still got to do the fixtures
 and wiring and put in a jacuzzi,

30:24.440 --> 30:26.560
 but we'll get there.

30:26.560 --> 30:29.160
 I've been daydreaming
 about a place like this.

30:29.160 --> 30:31.640
 Full scale, of course.

30:31.640 --> 30:35.200
 Two storey, porch swing,
 collie, wife, couple of rugrats.

30:35.200 --> 30:38.360
 Come on, you're young yet.

30:38.360 --> 30:41.880
 A bachelor life gets old fast.

30:41.880 --> 30:43.000
 I had one.

30:43.000 --> 30:44.200
 Sorry?

30:44.200 --> 30:46.800
 Nothing.

30:46.800 --> 30:47.880
 Well, back to work.

30:47.880 --> 30:49.440
 I'll get the door for you.

30:49.440 --> 30:53.440
 It's a beautiful day...

31:00.720 --> 31:04.720
 As you can see, I have inserted a
 needle into Mr Kagan's gall bladder,

31:06.800 --> 31:10.080
 which will drain the pus.
 So, you and Lucy...

31:10.080 --> 31:12.000
 No wedding bell blues.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.920
 No shoes, no rice. No groom
 so nervous, he answers twice.

31:14.920 --> 31:16.560
 Just making whoopee as usual.

31:16.560 --> 31:18.480
 You got it. Why involve
 the state this early?

31:18.480 --> 31:20.600
 Now, we flush the catheter...

31:20.600 --> 31:21.640
 Now, we flush the catheter...
  BEEPS

31:21.640 --> 31:22.720
 He's gone into arrest.

31:22.720 --> 31:25.240
 Start CPR.

31:25.240 --> 31:29.240
 Turn up the IC drip one to 1000.

31:33.640 --> 31:37.640
 What do you want?

31:38.520 --> 31:41.360
 I've been thinking all
 day about what you said.

31:41.360 --> 31:43.280
 I was gonna dance in
 with an assortment

31:43.280 --> 31:47.280
 of excuses, you know the rap.
 Too many cases, not enough hours.

31:47.680 --> 31:49.320
 The truth is, Shirl,

31:49.320 --> 31:52.560
 I never came and saw you at the
 prison because I was afraid.

31:52.560 --> 31:56.320
 And now you're not?

31:56.320 --> 31:58.920
 Maybe.

31:58.920 --> 32:01.320
 I got to know.
 Did you off that woman?

32:01.320 --> 32:02.440
 No.

32:02.440 --> 32:04.280
 I saw the whole thing, though.

32:04.280 --> 32:06.320
 From start to finish.

32:06.320 --> 32:07.400
 Seriously?

32:07.400 --> 32:08.840
 Maybe.

32:08.840 --> 32:12.720
 But if I did, I'd never tell.
 Why should I send somebody

32:12.720 --> 32:16.720
 to prison for doing good?
 That's what happened to me.

32:18.400 --> 32:21.200
 I've missed you, Shirl.

32:21.200 --> 32:24.040
 Missed you too.

32:24.040 --> 32:25.960
 But I'll tell you,

32:25.960 --> 32:28.680
 all those women locked up tight,

32:28.680 --> 32:32.440
 playing hot, sweaty field
 hockey in the recreation yard,

32:32.440 --> 32:36.440
 taking showers together,
 gets intense.

32:38.240 --> 32:39.920
 In what sense, intense?

32:39.920 --> 32:43.920
 Well, when you're in prison,

32:43.920 --> 32:46.960
 you get a lot less particular
 about where you cop your cuddles.

32:46.960 --> 32:48.040
 you get a lot less particular
 about where you cop your cuddles.
 What are you doing?

32:48.040 --> 32:50.360
 We used to have a ball, remember?

32:50.360 --> 32:54.000
 I always liked the way you
 could make lemonade out of lemon.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.040
 I want to see your scar.

32:56.040 --> 32:57.200
 This is not a good idea.

32:57.200 --> 32:58.680
 Why not?

32:58.680 --> 33:02.680
 Well, why not?
 I'm a doctor, you're a prisoner.

33:03.880 --> 33:05.120
 You're...

33:05.120 --> 33:08.680
 I'm chained.

33:08.680 --> 33:12.680
 You're chained.

33:25.600 --> 33:29.600
 The HMO is sending someone up
 from Baltimore to take inventory.

33:29.960 --> 33:32.760
 I wonder what they've
 got in store for us.

33:32.760 --> 33:35.960
 Who would want to buy
 a pig in a poke like St Eligius?

33:35.960 --> 33:38.760
 I told you. They think the
 south end will rise again.

33:38.760 --> 33:41.560
 They've crunched the numbers
 and are convinced that we can

33:41.560 --> 33:43.440
 be competitive with Boston General.

33:43.440 --> 33:46.080
 But why would they only talk
 to you and not to Donald and me?

33:46.080 --> 33:50.080
 Because they want clarity, not a
 lot of sentimental teeth gnashing

33:50.400 --> 33:52.440
 and fly-blown philosophy.

33:52.440 --> 33:55.200
 Listen, there's nothing
 sinister about these people.

33:55.200 --> 33:59.200
 They promised to preserve the
 essential character of St Eligius.

34:04.480 --> 34:07.920
 Maybe we shouldn't
 hold them to their word.

34:07.920 --> 34:09.639
 I think she's the same.

34:09.639 --> 34:11.159
 She hasn't changed one iota.

34:11.159 --> 34:13.239
 Her behaviour at the
 party was disgraceful.

34:13.239 --> 34:14.840
 No.

34:14.840 --> 34:16.920
 She's more vulnerable
 than before. More open.

34:16.920 --> 34:18.800
 I wonder if she killed her.

34:18.800 --> 34:19.840
  PHONE RINGS

34:19.840 --> 34:21.040
 Hello?

34:21.040 --> 34:25.040
 Yeah, he's right here.

34:25.120 --> 34:27.159
 You.

34:27.159 --> 34:30.880
 Hello.

34:30.880 --> 34:34.880
 What?

34:35.880 --> 34:39.880
 I'm sorry...who is this?

34:44.760 --> 34:47.120
 Boomer, what's up?

34:47.120 --> 34:48.159
 Nick Moats.

34:48.159 --> 34:49.840
 What about him?

34:49.840 --> 34:52.679
 That was Nick Moats.

34:52.679 --> 34:54.800
 He just threatened me,

34:54.800 --> 34:58.800
 and my family.

35:00.280 --> 35:02.400
 I feel spry and salty.

35:02.400 --> 35:04.960
 Well, your white count is falling.

35:04.960 --> 35:07.200
 Temperature's down.
 You can go home tomorrow.

35:07.200 --> 35:08.600
 Good. Been here too long.

35:08.600 --> 35:11.680
 Well, I wish you fair
 sailing and lots of luck.

35:11.680 --> 35:13.560
 Thanks.

35:13.560 --> 35:17.120
 This boy's a fine doctor.
 Real feel for his work.

35:17.120 --> 35:19.040
 You should be proud of him.

35:19.040 --> 35:21.160
 I'll see you later.

35:21.160 --> 35:25.160
 I'll stop back by before you go.

35:26.400 --> 35:28.720
 You didn't increase
 the gentamicin dosage.

35:28.720 --> 35:29.800
 No, sir.

35:29.800 --> 35:32.440
 Gutsy on your part.
 Also irresponsible.

35:32.440 --> 35:35.480
 You disobeyed my direct instructions.
 Worse, you deceived me.

35:35.480 --> 35:37.280
 You told me you'd do one
 thing, and did something else.

35:37.280 --> 35:38.360
 You told me you'd do one
 thing, and did something else.
 Yes, sir.

35:38.360 --> 35:41.640
 Luckily, this time,
 your instincts were right.

35:41.640 --> 35:44.400
 Dr Griffin, I was wrong in letting

35:44.400 --> 35:47.160
 my personal feelings cloud
 my assessment of your work.

35:47.160 --> 35:48.600
 You're talented.

35:48.600 --> 35:50.880
 I appreciate that, sir.

35:50.880 --> 35:53.080
 I just can't understand how

35:53.080 --> 35:57.080
 such a good doctor can be
 such a lousy human being.

36:06.720 --> 36:08.720
 You heard about Mr Kagan?

36:08.720 --> 36:10.040
 Yep.

36:10.040 --> 36:12.040
 Feel terrible.

36:12.040 --> 36:16.040
 Yeah, me too.
 So busy trying to prove you wrong,
 I forgot about the patie

36:16.520 --> 36:18.560
 The way we went at solving the
 problem

36:18.560 --> 36:21.840
 became a game, an abstraction.

36:21.840 --> 36:23.760
 We didn't actually do him any harm.

36:23.760 --> 36:26.200
 He had a bad heart.
 He needed the procedure.

36:26.200 --> 36:29.560
 He'd have died anyway.

36:29.560 --> 36:32.240
 Competition versus cooperation.

36:32.240 --> 36:34.920
 Which produces the best results?

36:34.920 --> 36:37.560
 How far are you going tonight?

36:37.560 --> 36:40.040
 I thought I'd do five.

36:40.040 --> 36:41.080
 Five?

36:41.080 --> 36:44.120
 Wouldn't even break a sweat.

36:44.120 --> 36:46.440
 What do you have in mind?

36:46.440 --> 36:49.920
 Ten.

36:49.920 --> 36:52.200
 You'll never last ten.

36:52.200 --> 36:56.080
 Bet?

36:56.080 --> 37:00.080
 Absolutely.

37:02.240 --> 37:04.880
 Well, this is where
 it all began, right

37:04.880 --> 37:07.880
 after Grandma's birthday party.
 Changed my life.

37:07.880 --> 37:09.080
 Hey.

37:09.080 --> 37:13.080
 Isn't this where you're supposed to
 carry me across the threshold?

37:13.120 --> 37:16.400
 Thank you for reminding me.

37:16.400 --> 37:20.280
 Ow!

37:20.280 --> 37:22.280
 I bruise easily!

37:22.280 --> 37:26.280
 You're too long. Wait a minute.

37:28.360 --> 37:29.320
 You're drunk!

37:29.320 --> 37:33.320
 There's only one way,
 the fireman's carry.

37:35.160 --> 37:37.160
 Oh, God!

37:37.160 --> 37:40.640
 The way we kept 'em guessing
 at the hospital today was great!

37:40.640 --> 37:44.000
 Are they, aren't they?

37:44.000 --> 37:44.840
 Come on,

37:44.840 --> 37:47.720
 plant one right here.

37:47.720 --> 37:49.840
 Hold it.

37:49.840 --> 37:51.520
 What?

37:51.520 --> 37:54.800
 Let's stop all this teasing around.
 Let's set the date.

37:54.800 --> 37:58.280
 Matrimonialise?
 Why not?

37:58.280 --> 38:02.200
 I love you.

38:02.200 --> 38:03.920
 Victor, what are you doing?

38:03.920 --> 38:06.520
 Proposing. What does it look like?

38:06.520 --> 38:10.520
 Will you?

38:10.680 --> 38:11.840
 Yes!

38:11.840 --> 38:14.480
 Me too!

38:14.480 --> 38:18.480
 Er...Ehrlich, is there
 something I should know about you?

38:18.960 --> 38:22.840
 I just want to see if
 they're getting cold.

38:22.840 --> 38:26.840
 No. They're very, very warm.

38:39.480 --> 38:41.200
 Fan mail from some flounder?

38:41.200 --> 38:43.920
 Phone number. Hotshot divorce lawyer.

38:43.920 --> 38:45.520
 I haven't seen you all day.

38:45.520 --> 38:46.560
 Surgery.

38:46.560 --> 38:47.600
 How did it go?

38:47.600 --> 38:51.240
 We lost him. My hand is killing me.

38:51.240 --> 38:52.320
 You?

38:52.320 --> 38:54.360
 I just said goodbye to this patient,

38:54.360 --> 38:56.640
 a Portuguese fisherman
 from Provincetown.

38:56.640 --> 39:00.640
 Old-fashioned, traditional values,
 like nature and God and work.

39:02.000 --> 39:03.760
 Real solid citizen.

39:03.760 --> 39:06.480
 Got me thinking
 about how superficial

39:06.480 --> 39:08.360
 my relationships have been.

39:08.360 --> 39:09.480
 You're tense.

39:09.480 --> 39:13.440
 I've been thinking of
 strangling Robert all day...oh!

39:13.440 --> 39:14.840
 Right here.

39:14.840 --> 39:17.960
 That's amazing.
 You do have the touch.

39:17.960 --> 39:19.640
 That's what my patients say.

39:19.640 --> 39:23.440
 And your women...what do they say?

39:23.440 --> 39:26.240
 With women, my
 hands are my downfall.

39:26.240 --> 39:29.760
 The first meaning of "manipulate" is
 to work something with your hands.

39:29.760 --> 39:31.160
 So, you are a manipulator?

39:31.160 --> 39:35.160
 Yeah, I'm afraid so,
 in every sense of the word.

39:36.080 --> 39:39.840
 I know you don't trust me.

39:39.840 --> 39:43.160
 And to tell you the truth, I've
 been a player so long, I don't know

39:43.160 --> 39:44.840
 if I'm pulling a number on you now.

39:44.840 --> 39:47.600
 But I want to change.

39:47.600 --> 39:49.920
 Why are you telling me all this?

39:49.920 --> 39:51.000
 I like you.

39:51.000 --> 39:54.200
 A lot.

39:54.200 --> 39:56.040
 We could be...good.

39:56.040 --> 40:00.040
 I wasn't kidding this morning
 about looking for somebody faithful.

40:00.720 --> 40:04.720
 I'm ready to start
 something serious, long-term.

40:05.600 --> 40:09.320
 I'm still grieving for my marriage.

40:09.320 --> 40:12.840
 The lawyer says the
 divorce is going to be bloody.

40:12.840 --> 40:16.840
 I haven't been on my
 own since high school.

40:17.560 --> 40:21.560
 Look, I had a really nice
 time with you last night.

40:24.960 --> 40:28.960
 And I love the idea
 of falling in love.

40:31.880 --> 40:35.880
 I'm just not ready to go steady.

40:41.440 --> 40:44.640
 Beautiful, isn't it?

40:44.640 --> 40:46.520
 What is this?

40:46.520 --> 40:49.360
 It's the dollhouse
 you bought for Barbara.

40:49.360 --> 40:51.760
 I hired Robin to do some odd jobs.

40:51.760 --> 40:53.960
 He spent the whole
 afternoon building it.

40:53.960 --> 40:57.960
 What are we, the WPA?
 Pirelli, Peltrovic, and now Baskins?

40:58.720 --> 41:00.520
 Employment for the downtrodden!

41:00.520 --> 41:02.160
 Didn't he do a lovely job?

41:02.160 --> 41:05.640
 For crying out loud, Ellen,
 I wanted to do this.

41:05.640 --> 41:08.720
 You promise and promise,
 but nothing ever happens.

41:08.720 --> 41:11.280
 I suppose we eat in the kitchen?

41:11.280 --> 41:14.040
 Well, you were so late,
 Robin and I had to go ahead.

41:14.040 --> 41:18.040
 You'll have to fend for yourself.
 Just check the freezer.

41:20.240 --> 41:22.520
 Hello, Mark.

41:22.520 --> 41:24.400
 What are you still doing here?

41:24.400 --> 41:26.720
 I invited him to spend the night.

41:26.720 --> 41:28.600
 No way! This is not halfway house.

41:28.600 --> 41:29.880
 Maybe I should leave.

41:29.880 --> 41:32.160
 Good idea.
 Is that my shirt?

41:32.160 --> 41:35.640
 Relax, Mark, I'm gonna buy him
 some clothes of his own tomorrow.

41:35.640 --> 41:37.080
 Relax, Mark, I'm gonna buy him
 some clothes of his own tomorrow.
 I'm a little down on my luck.

41:37.080 --> 41:40.400
 I know. Boy, do I know.

41:40.400 --> 41:42.720
 The class wiseass was a
 Wall Street bad boy,

41:42.720 --> 41:44.840
 and now you're on
 the Feed Me Express.

41:44.840 --> 41:47.360
 Don't you have
 any place to stay?

41:47.360 --> 41:50.840
 Sure, cardboard condo
 in an alley down town.

41:50.840 --> 41:54.440
 You want him to spend the
 night in a soggy appliance box?

41:54.440 --> 41:56.520
 I give up.

41:56.520 --> 41:59.640
 One night. That's it.

41:59.640 --> 42:02.920
 Registered and understood.

42:02.920 --> 42:04.000
 Where are you going?

42:04.000 --> 42:06.080
 Outside. I'm used to
 sleeping on the sidewalk.

42:06.080 --> 42:07.680
 It's freezing out there.

42:07.680 --> 42:09.480
 I'll curl up under the dryer vent.

42:09.480 --> 42:11.960
 You could run a load during
 the night. I'll be toasty.

42:11.960 --> 42:13.240
 Don't be silly.

42:13.240 --> 42:16.400
 The den is upstairs.
 Go up and make yourself comfortable.

42:16.400 --> 42:20.400
 If you insist.

42:21.960 --> 42:25.960
 Don't ultimatum me, Mark.
 I want him here.

42:32.600 --> 42:34.080
 Shirley?

42:34.080 --> 42:36.680
 Mac, hold it just a sec.

42:36.680 --> 42:39.720
 Boomer, didn't think anyone
 was gonna see me off.

42:39.720 --> 42:42.720
 I wanted to say goodbye.

42:42.720 --> 42:44.280
 It was great to see you.

42:44.280 --> 42:45.560
 Like old times.

42:45.560 --> 42:46.880
 Yeah.

42:46.880 --> 42:49.600
 Absolutely golden.

42:49.600 --> 42:52.560
 Better than a poke in the
 eye with a sharp stick.

42:52.560 --> 42:55.160
 Why are you so bitter?

42:55.160 --> 42:58.240
 I thought I was coming home.

42:58.240 --> 43:02.240
 I thought people would understand,
 forgive me.

43:02.640 --> 43:06.640
 But I'm just an object
 of curiosity, a freak.

43:08.000 --> 43:11.880
 All my friends assume
 I killed that old woman.

43:11.880 --> 43:15.880
 No trial, no testimony, just guilty.

43:16.280 --> 43:18.960
 I'm sorry.

43:18.960 --> 43:20.440
 Come on, the wagon's waiting.

43:20.440 --> 43:22.320
 Wait.

43:22.320 --> 43:25.720
 Hold on.

43:25.720 --> 43:29.720
 Shirley...

43:30.600 --> 43:34.600
 when you're...in prison and
 ...somebody has it in for you,

43:37.520 --> 43:40.600
 they say they're gonna get you, what
 do you...has it happened to you?

43:40.600 --> 43:42.400
 Yeah.

43:42.400 --> 43:45.120
 What do you do?

43:45.120 --> 43:47.280
 You whack them first.

43:47.280 --> 43:51.280
 Take 'em out before they do you.

43:52.920 --> 43:56.400
 Right.

43:56.400 --> 43:58.760
 You know, sometimes, Jack,

43:58.760 --> 44:01.280
 I imagine we're on
 the roof that night.

44:01.280 --> 44:04.320
 You're talking to me.

44:04.320 --> 44:08.320
 But instead of putting the gun down,
 this time I pull the trigger.

44:09.440 --> 44:11.920
 Your brains explode,

44:11.920 --> 44:15.920
 and then I put the gun in my mouth,
 and I pull the trigger again.

44:17.320 --> 44:20.080
 And you and me,

44:20.080 --> 44:24.080
 we're together for all eternity.

44:25.480 --> 44:27.120
 Why do you say things like that?

44:27.120 --> 44:31.120
 I just want you to know how
 much I've always cared about you.

44:32.280 --> 44:34.360
 Let's go.

44:34.360 --> 44:38.360
 You get the scum that
 raped you, Jack.

44:39.160 --> 44:43.160
 I will.

45:51.720 --> 45:55.720
  CONTINUOUS BEEP
