00:16.760 --> 00:18.399
You're late.

00:18.400 --> 00:20.399
On the beach. Lost
track of time.

00:20.400 --> 00:23.279
You want to take a leaf out of
your stepbrother's book.

00:23.280 --> 00:26.799
Labouring all day and then off
to night classes. Proper grafter.

00:26.800 --> 00:28.480
We can't all be perfect.

00:30.440 --> 00:31.759
Congrats, Dad.

00:31.760 --> 00:34.560
Cheers! Did you see the plans?
Yeah, it'll be good.

00:35.960 --> 00:39.039
Blimey, I hope my clientele's
more enthusiastic.

00:39.040 --> 00:41.759
Don't worry, the Look At My Enormous
Yacht brigade will love it.

00:41.760 --> 00:43.759
I just miss the old days.

00:43.760 --> 00:46.439
A lot's changed since you and
your mother lived here, I know,

00:46.440 --> 00:49.159
but there are good times ahead,
trust me.

00:49.160 --> 00:51.119
Here, take these.

00:51.120 --> 00:52.639
Been trying to do DIY again?

00:52.640 --> 00:55.200
Cheeky cow!

00:57.280 --> 00:58.920
Here you go.

01:01.440 --> 01:03.959
To the West Country Pub of the Year!
Cheers!

01:03.960 --> 01:05.239
Cheers!

01:06.600 --> 01:08.599
This award's just the start.

01:08.600 --> 01:10.399
I've got a surprise
for the reopening

01:10.400 --> 01:13.719
that'll get the punters
flocking from all over.

01:13.720 --> 01:17.479
I'm so proud of you, gorgeous!
Mmmmm!

01:17.480 --> 01:19.799
Put him down, Mum!

01:19.800 --> 01:22.799
Don't you worry,
you're still my special little man.

01:22.800 --> 01:25.279
Hm. So, come on,
how are we celebrating?

01:25.280 --> 01:27.159
I vote we keep it simple.

01:27.160 --> 01:30.039
Quiz night at the Black Dog.

01:30.040 --> 01:32.999
Hey, Roz! Where've you been hiding?

01:33.000 --> 01:35.039
I've been busy with work. Ah!

01:35.040 --> 01:39.199
Ah! I hear you've been fraternising
with the enemy.

01:39.200 --> 01:42.359
You want to watch yourself, Brian,
working for Tam. Can't be trusted.

01:42.360 --> 01:45.079
The way business is,
builders can't be choosers.

01:45.080 --> 01:47.959
And it's a high-profile job for us,
what with the award...

01:47.960 --> 01:50.519
Sorry. If The Captain's Pipe

01:50.520 --> 01:53.719
is the best pub in the West Country,
I'm Harry Styles!

01:53.720 --> 01:55.679
You and Tam still not kissed
and made up, then?

01:55.680 --> 01:57.879
No. Not even until hell
freezes over.

01:57.880 --> 02:00.359
Love what you've done
with the place, Mick!

02:00.360 --> 02:02.839
Those damp patches on the walls

02:02.840 --> 02:05.119
give it that authentic
spit 'n' sawdust feel!

02:05.120 --> 02:06.519
What you doing here, Tam?

02:06.520 --> 02:08.399
Can't I drop in on an old friend?

02:08.400 --> 02:10.038
You ain't got no friends here.

02:10.039 --> 02:12.359
Charming! You heard about the award?

02:12.360 --> 02:14.279
I don't like to rest on my laurels,

02:14.280 --> 02:16.919
so I thought we'd come
and check out the competition.

02:16.920 --> 02:19.199
If you can call it that. You can't!

02:19.200 --> 02:23.199
This is a proper pub, unlike
your overpriced gastro garbage.

02:23.200 --> 02:24.679
Ha-ha! Fierce one, isn't she?

02:24.680 --> 02:26.839
You keep talking,
you'll see how fierce.

02:26.840 --> 02:30.199
How'd you pull a woman like her when
you can't even pull a proper pint?

02:30.200 --> 02:33.159
By not being a two-faced,
perma-tanned Judas like you.

02:33.160 --> 02:36.639
Now, get out my pub! So much for the
Black Dog's legendary warm welcome(!)

02:36.640 --> 02:38.279
Want a warm welcome from my fist?

02:38.280 --> 02:39.879
Maybe we should go somewhere else.

02:39.880 --> 02:43.359
Listen to your wife, Tam. Turns out
she's got a brain under all that hair.

02:43.360 --> 02:45.879
Don't you talk to Claire like that.

02:45.880 --> 02:48.799
Just cos you chose
the wrong landlord!

02:48.800 --> 02:50.999
Right, that's it! Get out of my pub!

02:51.000 --> 02:53.479
Calm down, mate! I'm not your mate.

02:53.480 --> 02:57.080
And if you come around here again,
I will smash your head in! Out!

04:11.800 --> 04:14.480
I didn't see you,
you didn't see me, right? Deal.

04:19.120 --> 04:20.719
Morning!

04:20.720 --> 04:23.879
OK, I accidentally fell asleep
on Freya's sofa.

04:23.880 --> 04:25.799
It wasn't my fault.
You're grounded!

04:25.800 --> 04:29.039
Go upstairs, get some sleep and...
But... We'll talk about this later!

04:29.040 --> 04:31.760
Where've you been?
None of your business.

04:48.880 --> 04:51.279
Davey.

04:51.280 --> 04:54.159
Any ID?
They're still digging him out now.

04:54.160 --> 04:56.879
Coastguard called
a couple of hours ago.

04:56.880 --> 04:59.279
Maybe he went for an early-morning
walk, or something.

04:59.280 --> 05:02.119
Can't have been that early. There's
no access to this cove at high tide.

05:02.120 --> 05:03.759
I go surfing all around this coast.

05:03.760 --> 05:05.319
All right, I'll check
the tide times.

05:05.320 --> 05:07.159
At the moment, to get here by foot,

05:07.160 --> 05:11.159
you need to be here before midnight
or after 6:00am, give or take.

05:11.160 --> 05:13.239
I knew you were useful
for something.

05:13.240 --> 05:15.159
Maybe he came by boat.

05:15.160 --> 05:16.759
So, where's the boat?

05:16.760 --> 05:19.399
And if he did get here by boat,
he'd have to swim the last bit.

05:19.400 --> 05:22.119
You see, these rocks, they form
a barrier all around this cove.

05:22.120 --> 05:24.759
Kerry Bliss tried to catch
a wave through them once

05:24.760 --> 05:26.399
and broke her boogie
in three places.

05:26.400 --> 05:27.959
Sounds painful.

05:27.960 --> 05:30.359
Well, the body's too high up
the water line to have washed up.

05:30.360 --> 05:31.879
Something's not right.

05:31.880 --> 05:34.559
Pretty unlucky dude
to be stood underneath a rock fall.

05:34.560 --> 05:38.479
Unlucky's one thing. This whole area
should've been cordoned off.

05:38.480 --> 05:42.519
There's construction work going on
on the pub up on the cliff top.

05:42.520 --> 05:44.959
You're thinking
that's what caused the collapse?

05:44.960 --> 05:47.879
Maybe.
Hence your invitation to the party.

05:47.880 --> 05:50.719
Here's me thinking it's for
my scintillating conversation(!)

05:50.720 --> 05:53.439
We have to prove negligence
for corporate manslaughter.

05:53.440 --> 05:54.839
I'll talk to the owner.

05:54.840 --> 05:56.239
Sarge? Yeah.

05:56.240 --> 05:59.040
I'll go and check those tide times.
Come on, lets have a look.

06:10.600 --> 06:12.840
I don't think the owner's
going to be much help.

06:15.840 --> 06:18.479
I hope you don't mind my colleague,
Jane Kennedy, sitting in.

06:18.480 --> 06:21.639
She's working with us to ascertain
the cause of death. Cause of death?

06:21.640 --> 06:24.559
I thought you said he was buried
under a load of rubble?

06:24.560 --> 06:26.519
Sorry, Mum.

06:26.520 --> 06:28.839
As far as we're aware,
this was a tragic accident,

06:28.840 --> 06:31.599
but we would like to know
if anything triggered the rock fall

06:31.600 --> 06:34.120
and why Tam was on the cove.

06:35.640 --> 06:37.679
So, when was the last time
you saw him?

06:37.680 --> 06:41.119
After the pub.
We walked Lucy to a friend's house.

06:41.120 --> 06:43.399
Lucy, she's your stepsister,
is that right?

06:43.400 --> 06:45.879
Yeah, that's right.
It's Tam's daughter.

06:45.880 --> 06:48.000
And then we came back here.

06:49.040 --> 06:51.199
Tam insisted that we open up
another bottle.

06:51.200 --> 06:53.799
We were up until about 1:00.

06:53.800 --> 06:56.519
And when did you realise
he'd gone missing?

06:56.520 --> 06:58.920
I heard him on the stairs
around 3:00.

07:00.240 --> 07:01.639
He often doesn't sleep well.

07:01.640 --> 07:03.799
Sometimes, he'll go down the bar
to watch telly.

07:03.800 --> 07:05.479
Sorry, 3:00, are you sure?

07:05.480 --> 07:07.399
I checked my phone.

07:07.400 --> 07:10.879
Er... I must've nodded off.

07:10.880 --> 07:14.079
Then I heard a sound, like thunder.

07:14.080 --> 07:15.759
Yeah, I heard it, too.

07:15.760 --> 07:17.439
I guess that was the rock fall.

07:17.440 --> 07:21.439
All right. And then?
Woke up again around 6:00.

07:21.440 --> 07:25.880
Only Tam wasn't back in bed,
so I went downstairs.

07:26.880 --> 07:28.239
But he wasn't there either.

07:28.240 --> 07:31.640
It's all right. Take your time.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.999
We'd only been married a few months.

07:35.000 --> 07:39.520
I know people think I'm some
gold-digger, but I loved him so much!

07:40.920 --> 07:44.439
And when I heard the sirens
and saw you lot on the cove,

07:44.440 --> 07:46.720
I just knew!

07:48.560 --> 07:51.599
Right, I-I think that's us for now.

07:51.600 --> 07:53.719
I'll show you guys out. All right.

07:53.720 --> 07:55.520
OK. Thank you.

07:59.280 --> 08:01.679
Who's doing the extension?
Teddern Construction.

08:01.680 --> 08:04.239
Brian Teddern?
Isn't he going out with...?

08:04.240 --> 08:07.879
Roz and Tam divorced
a long time ago. It's all amicable.

08:07.880 --> 08:10.879
I've been working for Brian
as a labourer.

08:10.880 --> 08:14.199
I'm hoping to build houses of my own
one day. It's all good experience.

08:14.200 --> 08:17.439
Yeah. Any problems onsite? No, none.

08:17.440 --> 08:20.679
Did you get on with Tam? The
stepparent thing isn't always easy.

08:20.680 --> 08:23.959
My real dad scarpered when my mum
was still pregnant.

08:23.960 --> 08:26.799
She was amazing, but it was tough.

08:26.800 --> 08:30.399
The past couple of years, it's been
like I had a proper family, you know.

08:30.400 --> 08:32.080
Oh. One sec.

08:35.080 --> 08:39.479
Bit cosy, getting your ex-wife's
new man to renovate your pub.

08:39.480 --> 08:41.558
Modern families for you, isn't it?

08:41.559 --> 08:43.479
Claire and Scott seem close.

08:43.480 --> 08:46.439
Close or not,
they're either mistaken or lying.

08:46.440 --> 08:48.879
Because if they were together
until 1:00, there's no way.

08:48.880 --> 08:52.759
Tam could've made it to the cove before
the rock fall because of the tide times.

08:52.760 --> 08:55.439
Oh, hello there. This is my
colleague, Jane Kennedy, she's...

08:55.440 --> 08:57.839
Yeah, I know who she is,
Judith's girl.

08:57.840 --> 09:00.039
Let me save you the trouble.

09:00.040 --> 09:04.719
As operations manager, I guarantee
there's no heavy machinery onsite.

09:04.720 --> 09:06.959
Ground disturbance was minimal.

09:06.960 --> 09:09.599
None of us would've been here
when the cliff collapsed.

09:09.600 --> 09:11.199
Jane's just trying to establish...

09:11.200 --> 09:13.239
Whether it was our fault.
Well, it wasn't.

09:13.240 --> 09:16.079
It's still our job to inform
the Health and Safety Executive.

09:16.080 --> 09:17.679
I'll need your risk assessments

09:17.680 --> 09:20.319
and details of any work
undertaken to date.

09:20.320 --> 09:22.999
Paperwork's back at the office.
I'll send it over ASAP.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.479
Great. Thank you.

09:24.480 --> 09:27.599
Look, no-one's here to accuse you
of anything, but a man has died.

09:27.600 --> 09:30.279
I know. He was my dad!

09:30.280 --> 09:31.680
Come on.

09:37.960 --> 09:41.999
Clint. Hi, Jane. Coastguard says rock
falls along this stretch are unusual,

09:42.000 --> 09:43.479
but not unheard of.

09:43.480 --> 09:46.599
Oh, and he confirmed there's only
access to the cove at low tide.

09:46.600 --> 09:50.119
OK. Can you go to the
council planning department?

09:50.120 --> 09:53.159
Get copies of everything they have
on the building application

09:53.160 --> 09:55.319
and then talk to HSE
about Teddern Construction.

09:55.320 --> 09:58.479
See if there's any history of
complaints, or safety problems.

09:58.480 --> 10:00.039
Yeah, yeah, OK.

10:00.040 --> 10:03.040
Great. I'll talk to you later.
Cheers. Bye.

10:04.320 --> 10:06.919
What do you think?
Have they been cutting corners?

10:06.920 --> 10:09.959
Maybe.
Roz seemed pretty confrontational.

10:09.960 --> 10:12.879
Well, you can have that effect
on people.

10:12.880 --> 10:14.880
Excuse me! Ow!

10:25.080 --> 10:26.679
Here you go, love.

10:26.680 --> 10:29.479
To think they used to be
best friends. Who?

10:29.480 --> 10:32.799
Mick and Tam. Really? What happened?

10:32.800 --> 10:36.159
You know men.
Always a woman involved.

10:36.160 --> 10:38.800
Where was Mick last night? Nowhere.

10:40.080 --> 10:42.759
What do you mean?
No, nothing. I just...

10:42.760 --> 10:44.760
Oh, I must've got my wires crossed.

10:51.400 --> 10:53.119
Hey!
Guess what we found up on the cove?

10:53.120 --> 10:54.719
Er... a treasure chest? No.

10:54.720 --> 10:58.239
Giant turtle?
No. A tunnel, or so we think.

10:58.240 --> 11:01.799
The lads found the entrance while
they were digging out Tam's body.

11:01.800 --> 11:05.559
Where does it lead? Don't know yet,
they're still clearing the rocks.

11:05.560 --> 11:08.439
But I have heard talk there was
an old smugglers' tunnel up there.

11:08.440 --> 11:11.719
But if you believe folklore,
every coastal town in Devon has one!

11:11.720 --> 11:14.479
True, but how else did Tam
get on the cove?

11:14.480 --> 11:18.039
And why go snooping around in
tunnels unless you're up to no good?

11:18.040 --> 11:21.040
So...? So maybe it wasn't
an accident after all.

11:27.480 --> 11:31.719
Well, technically speaking,
we're not supposed to be in here.

11:31.720 --> 11:35.439
No-one's made sure
the tunnel's stable yet.

11:35.440 --> 11:37.440
I'm only having a peek.

11:39.280 --> 11:42.399
Oh! There goes that theory.

11:42.400 --> 11:43.960
It's a dead-end.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.440
No, no, no. That earth's fresh.

11:50.960 --> 11:53.639
So if the tunnel collapsed, that
might have caused the rock fall.

11:53.640 --> 11:55.799
And if Tam was on the cove...

11:55.800 --> 11:58.519
So we need to find out
who else knew about this.

11:58.520 --> 12:00.839
Yeah.

12:00.840 --> 12:05.479
If Tam was up to no good,
it's a police inquiry.

12:05.480 --> 12:08.999
You're telling me to butt out? Yeah.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.840
Fine. But I would like to talk
to Claire again.

12:14.800 --> 12:17.120
Yeah, wait for me.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.959
So, you had no idea it was there?

12:21.960 --> 12:23.879
Tam never mentioned it?

12:23.880 --> 12:26.919
A tunnel? No. I've heard stories,
but I didn't believe them.

12:26.920 --> 12:30.280
Not that I'd want to go in it.
I get claustrophobic in a phone box.

12:32.400 --> 12:34.439
I knocked, but, er...

12:34.440 --> 12:36.679
After how you treated him
last night?!

12:36.680 --> 12:39.999
Look, me and Tam, you know, we...
I don't want you here!

12:40.000 --> 12:44.160
Please! You threw him out of your
pub, now I'm throwing you out of his!

12:50.960 --> 12:53.320
This history, do you...?
Before my time.

12:55.360 --> 12:58.680
These stories, did they ever mention
where the tunnel came out?

13:02.800 --> 13:04.719
It could be anywhere.

13:04.720 --> 13:07.759
Well, assuming the tunnel wasn't
built by Isambard Kingdom Brunel,

13:07.760 --> 13:09.439
it can't be that long.

13:09.440 --> 13:11.479
And as it's been kept secret
all this time,

13:11.480 --> 13:14.640
I reckon the entrance
must be somewhere in the grounds.

13:18.760 --> 13:21.119
Ow! That's lethal!

13:21.120 --> 13:22.959
Yeah.

13:22.960 --> 13:24.920
Tam had a cut on his hand, actually.

13:27.840 --> 13:29.480
All right, let's have a look.

13:50.960 --> 13:53.640
Hey, have a look at this.

13:57.400 --> 13:59.280
Old grille, new padlock.

14:01.440 --> 14:04.279
Yeah. I'll see if there was a key
found with the body

14:04.280 --> 14:06.280
and get all this dusted for prints.

14:08.480 --> 14:11.119
If you got someone to build
on your land,

14:11.120 --> 14:13.719
wouldn't you mention there's
a tunnel running underneath it?

14:13.720 --> 14:15.719
Is that your way of trying
to convince me

14:15.720 --> 14:19.120
this is a corporate-manslaughter
case so I don't send you packing?

14:20.320 --> 14:22.040
Did it work? Hm!

14:33.920 --> 14:35.639
Brings back memories, doesn't it?

14:35.640 --> 14:39.599
Our kingdom. You, me and Tam,
the three musketeers.

14:39.600 --> 14:41.599
Three stooges, more like.

14:41.600 --> 14:44.279
Daft kids jumping into rock pools.

14:44.280 --> 14:48.239
Smoking cigarettes
we stole from my mum, snogging.

14:48.240 --> 14:52.039
You and Tam were the ones
doing the mouth-snorkelling.

14:52.040 --> 14:53.959
What went wrong between you two, eh?

14:53.960 --> 14:55.799
I thought you'd last forever.

14:55.800 --> 14:57.639
Tam was a hopeless romantic.

14:57.640 --> 14:59.679
Reality could never live up
to the dream.

14:59.680 --> 15:02.080
Especially after I got pregnant
with Lucy.

15:04.120 --> 15:06.959
And now?
All good between you and Brian?

15:06.960 --> 15:08.000
Course.

15:12.120 --> 15:13.840
Looks like our secret's out.

15:17.120 --> 15:20.239
Tam applied to buy this strip
of land from the council.

15:20.240 --> 15:23.359
Said he wanted to build it into
a new car-park.

15:23.360 --> 15:27.039
And what's this? Oh, a local
surveyor drew it up for me.

15:27.040 --> 15:30.279
Look, it's a bit of a guesstimate,
but it shows the tunnel's

15:30.280 --> 15:33.839
likely path, based on the
underlying rock formations.

15:33.840 --> 15:35.599
The Captain's Pipe.

15:35.600 --> 15:38.159
And are these the plans for the
building work?

15:38.160 --> 15:41.919
Yeah, so you've got this one on the
left. It's the original footprint

15:41.920 --> 15:45.160
for the conservatory and
this one is the revised plan, see.

15:47.040 --> 15:49.039
Why was it moved?

15:49.040 --> 15:51.159
Doesn't really say, sorry.

15:51.160 --> 15:53.119
What about Brian's safety record?

15:53.120 --> 15:54.279
It's clean.

15:54.280 --> 15:57.159
Ideally, he would've cordoned off
this section of the cove,

15:57.160 --> 16:00.239
but the work wasn't happening right
on the cliff-edge

16:00.240 --> 16:01.839
and it's not a busy stretch.

16:01.840 --> 16:07.159
Just a freak accident. It's one
man, wrong place, wrong time.

16:07.160 --> 16:09.559
Maybe not. Who are you calling?

16:09.560 --> 16:12.120
I want to see what Tam
has to say for himself.

16:14.920 --> 16:17.079
Right, according to the pathologist,

16:17.080 --> 16:20.119
he was probably killed by a single
blunt-trauma injury to the skull.

16:20.120 --> 16:24.159
And it looks like all other
injuries were post mortem.

16:24.160 --> 16:26.839
So Tam was dead before
he was covered by the rock fall?

16:26.840 --> 16:31.119
And the grille was locked
from the outside.

16:31.120 --> 16:32.720
So this is a murder inquiry?

16:33.800 --> 16:36.359
Yes, all right, I'll back off.
I promise.

16:36.360 --> 16:38.559
But just keep me in the loop.

16:38.560 --> 16:40.999
I mean, unless you want to
bounce ideas around.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.199
Did you find Tam's keys?

16:43.200 --> 16:44.839
Yeah, in his jacket pocket.

16:44.840 --> 16:48.479
But we're not allowed down the well until
they declare the tunnel safe, so...

16:48.480 --> 16:51.199
Having said that, though, I've done
a bit of digging of my own.

16:51.200 --> 16:52.959
See what you did there?
Erm, yeah.

16:52.960 --> 16:56.159
Now we couldn't find Tam's
mobile phone,

16:56.160 --> 16:57.759
so we pulled his phone records.

16:57.760 --> 16:59.279
He got a call in the early hours.

16:59.280 --> 17:02.039
Who from?
Unregistered pay-as-you-go.

17:02.040 --> 17:04.878
So someone's phoned him, arranged to
meet him, killed him

17:04.880 --> 17:06.319
and left his body on the cove.

17:06.319 --> 17:09.079
Where he was buried under the
rock fall.

17:09.079 --> 17:10.520
So who else knew about the tunnel?

17:12.359 --> 17:14.959
You know, I think the conservatory
was going to be built over

17:14.960 --> 17:16.759
the tunnel,
but the plans were changed,

17:16.760 --> 17:20.479
so, maybe Tam warned Brian
it was there.

17:20.480 --> 17:23.159
Yeah. Could have just as
easily have been Roz.

17:23.160 --> 17:25.559
Maybe their divorce wasn't as
amicable after all.

17:25.560 --> 17:29.319
Or Claire could have lied when she
said Tam never told her about it.

17:29.320 --> 17:32.519
I mean,
she stands to inherit the pub.

17:32.520 --> 17:35.279
There's someone else you
need to talk to.

17:35.280 --> 17:37.280
He's not going to be happy about it.

17:38.920 --> 17:41.319
This a sick joke?
Mick's done nothing wrong.

17:41.320 --> 17:44.159
I'm sure he hasn't, Judith, but I've
also got witnesses saying that

17:44.160 --> 17:46.079
he threatened to
smash Tam's head in.

17:46.080 --> 17:48.759
He was just mouthing off!
This is ridiculous! Tell him.

17:48.760 --> 17:52.399
He also doesn't have an alibi.
Course he does! He was with me.

17:52.400 --> 17:55.159
Oh, you told him? Cheers.
Told him what?

17:55.160 --> 17:56.439
What was I supposed to do?

17:56.440 --> 17:59.559
Stick up for me. Told him what?

17:59.560 --> 18:03.519
I saw Mick sneaking back into the house in
the early hours of the morning. So did Beth.

18:03.520 --> 18:07.119
Mick? I wasn't sneaking anywhere!
I went for a walk. That's it.

18:07.120 --> 18:09.759
And you think that means
he killed Tam?

18:09.760 --> 18:10.919
No, of course not.

18:10.920 --> 18:13.039
Mick, just come with me
down the station.

18:13.040 --> 18:15.599
Can't we do this here?
No, I've got to do this by the book.

18:15.600 --> 18:17.840
That means you making
a formal statement.

18:22.600 --> 18:23.640
Wait here.

18:29.680 --> 18:31.279
You haven't told anyone, have you?

18:31.280 --> 18:34.919
Course not. And if anyone asks,
you didn't see me. Obviously!

18:34.920 --> 18:37.839
I'm not exactly going to shout it
from the rooftops, am I?

18:37.840 --> 18:40.119
Look. I can't do this any more.

18:40.120 --> 18:41.519
Why not?

18:41.520 --> 18:44.399
I don't need the hassle.
What about what I need?

18:44.400 --> 18:46.759
My dad's dead, Scott!

18:46.760 --> 18:48.560
I know. I'm sorry.

18:49.720 --> 18:52.279
My head's all over the place
at the minute.

18:52.280 --> 18:55.559
Have they figured out what Tam was
doing down there yet?

18:55.560 --> 18:58.759
Dunno, but I just saw them carting
off Mick Sturrock.

18:58.760 --> 19:00.359
Mick? Why?

19:00.360 --> 19:01.960
Must think he was involved.

19:04.920 --> 19:07.879
So where did you go?
I told you. I went for a walk.

19:07.880 --> 19:08.999
Where?

19:09.000 --> 19:11.679
Here and there. Nowhere special.

19:11.680 --> 19:13.399
Anyone see you?

19:13.400 --> 19:14.440
I dunno.

19:16.720 --> 19:20.319
Look, you're not helping yourself
here, Mick! I need details.

19:20.320 --> 19:21.599
I was at Judith's.

19:21.600 --> 19:25.119
I woke up early,
I went for a walk, I came back.

19:25.120 --> 19:26.919
End of.

19:26.920 --> 19:29.319
You sure you don't want a solicitor?

19:29.320 --> 19:30.399
I don't need one.

19:30.400 --> 19:33.199
Yeah, you do. You do, Mick.

19:33.200 --> 19:36.519
A word of advice -
not as a copper but as a mate.

19:36.520 --> 19:40.160
This is a murder investigation.
You might want to cooperate.

19:41.440 --> 19:42.480
Can I go now?

19:43.560 --> 19:46.840
Sorry. I'm going to have to
place you under arrest.

19:57.080 --> 19:59.439
Nobody answered the door, so...

19:59.440 --> 20:00.480
Oh. How can I help?

20:02.000 --> 20:04.639
I didn't know whether I should
go to the police.

20:04.640 --> 20:06.639
Is this about Tam?

20:06.640 --> 20:08.879
I heard that Mick Sturrock
got taken in.

20:08.880 --> 20:12.039
Well, the thing is... I saw them.

20:12.040 --> 20:14.039
A few days ago. Mick and Tam.

20:14.040 --> 20:16.439
When will it get through that
cider-addled skull of yours

20:16.440 --> 20:18.599
it was a stupid misunderstanding!

20:18.600 --> 20:21.159
Misunderstanding?!
You tried it on with Judith.

20:21.160 --> 20:22.839
You don't do that to a mate!

20:22.840 --> 20:25.439
I was drunk! It was years ago!

20:25.440 --> 20:28.119
And you know what they say,
Mick: takes two to tango.

20:28.120 --> 20:31.239
You watch your mouth.
And anyway, I'm not here about that.

20:31.240 --> 20:33.199
I want my cut. What cut?

20:33.200 --> 20:34.439
The three of us had a deal.

20:34.440 --> 20:36.719
We said that whatever happened,
that tunnel was ours.

20:36.720 --> 20:40.399
Oh, grow up! That's ancient history.

20:40.400 --> 20:42.040
I don't owe you nothing.

20:43.040 --> 20:44.639
You'll regret this.

20:44.640 --> 20:46.359
Mick knew about the tunnel?

20:46.360 --> 20:48.759
I guess so. I didn't really
understand at the time.

20:48.760 --> 20:51.519
But I just thought that someone
should know.

20:51.520 --> 20:54.319
Yeah, thanks. Leave it with me.

20:54.320 --> 20:57.680
Whatever you say. To be honest,
I'd rather not be involved.

21:06.600 --> 21:08.240
Can I have a minute, please?

21:14.600 --> 21:16.120
Here to stick the knife in?

21:18.480 --> 21:20.159
Did you know about the tunnel?

21:20.160 --> 21:23.519
Why? Do you think I killed him?
No, of course not!

21:23.520 --> 21:25.239
Mick, I shouldn't even be here.

21:25.240 --> 21:28.159
I had to convince the custody
sergeant I was family.

21:28.160 --> 21:29.200
So?

21:30.520 --> 21:33.239
Yes, I knew.
It don't prove anything, does it?

21:33.240 --> 21:35.119
Whoever killed Tam used the tunnel.

21:35.120 --> 21:37.639
Plus there's the threat it poses
to the Black Dog,

21:37.640 --> 21:39.879
the additional trade it would
generate for Tam's pub.

21:39.880 --> 21:42.600
That's motive.
If the police found...

21:44.280 --> 21:46.399
Davey can only protect you
for so long.

21:46.400 --> 21:47.879
Oh, is that what he's doing?

21:47.880 --> 21:51.399
You haven't been charged yet, have you? Cos
there's no evidence I've done anything!

21:51.400 --> 21:53.319
Then help me find out what
really happened.

21:53.320 --> 21:54.520
Or do you like it in here?

21:56.440 --> 22:01.919
I saw the notice saying Tam wanted
the land to extend his car park.

22:01.920 --> 22:04.679
From the moment he bought that pub
and changed the name,

22:04.680 --> 22:06.399
I knew it'd come to this.

22:06.400 --> 22:07.519
Come to what?

22:07.520 --> 22:11.679
He wants to turn our tunnel
into a tourist attraction!

22:11.680 --> 22:12.720
YOUR tunnel?

22:13.840 --> 22:16.319
As kids, Tam, Roz and I were close.

22:16.320 --> 22:18.159
You know, real close.

22:18.160 --> 22:21.199
One day, messing around in the cove,
we discovered the tunnel.

22:21.200 --> 22:22.759
You didn't tell anyone?

22:22.760 --> 22:27.120
Would you? Three teenagers,
got their own private cove.

22:28.280 --> 22:31.759
High-tide, we'd nip across the wall
from the pub,

22:31.760 --> 22:34.559
go down there and it was all ours.

22:34.560 --> 22:36.159
No-one else's.

22:36.160 --> 22:38.519
No-one knew we were there
or what we were up to.

22:38.520 --> 22:40.119
You kept it a secret all this time?

22:40.120 --> 22:42.639
Yeah, and over the years,
we kept it a secret,

22:42.640 --> 22:44.479
even when Tam and Roz split up.

22:44.480 --> 22:48.279
You know, making sure the
entrance was covered up.

22:48.280 --> 22:51.280
And then Tam and I had our
falling out.

22:52.320 --> 22:54.160
What was that about?

22:55.200 --> 22:57.799
Years ago, I...

22:57.800 --> 23:00.119
I told him I liked your mum.

23:00.120 --> 23:02.079
I REALLY liked her.

23:02.080 --> 23:04.839
This was before
he started going out with Claire.

23:04.840 --> 23:05.919
And what did he do?

23:05.920 --> 23:08.319
Went straight over there
and tried it on with Judith.

23:08.320 --> 23:09.880
Unsuccessfully, I might add!

23:11.680 --> 23:14.599
But he and I -
we've barely spoke since then.

23:14.600 --> 23:17.519
Where were you this morning?

23:17.520 --> 23:19.120
Did you go and see Tam?

23:20.680 --> 23:22.640
I can't tell you that. Aw, Mick!

23:24.480 --> 23:27.159
Look, I know we've had our
differences,

23:27.160 --> 23:29.679
but Mum's never been so happy,
and that is down to you.

23:29.680 --> 23:31.439
I want to help you.

23:31.440 --> 23:34.200
OK, I went to see a supplier.

23:35.680 --> 23:38.719
Things have been a bit tricky
recently thanks to Tam's place

23:38.720 --> 23:41.559
and I got offered some cheap booze.

23:41.560 --> 23:46.159
And I didn't want to do it,
but seeing that smug grin on him...

23:46.160 --> 23:47.840
Fell off the back of a ferry?

23:49.440 --> 23:50.480
What's so funny?

23:52.080 --> 23:54.279
Everyone knows you do dodgy deals.

23:54.280 --> 23:56.519
Davey's turned a blind eye before.

23:56.520 --> 24:00.480
It's different. These aren't the
people I normally do business with.

24:01.560 --> 24:05.159
They're a gang.
Really nasty pieces of work.

24:05.160 --> 24:09.039
If they found out that I'd been
blabbing to the cops, well...

24:09.040 --> 24:10.200
they wouldn't be happy.

24:11.760 --> 24:16.479
I see. And then when I let slip who
I was doing the business with,

24:16.480 --> 24:19.039
Judith told me to back out.

24:19.040 --> 24:22.159
And if she thinks I'd... gone
back...

24:22.160 --> 24:25.919
Oh, come on, Mick. She'll understand. So
will Davey, if you give him a chance.

24:25.920 --> 24:29.199
If I tell Davey,
it has to go on record.

24:29.200 --> 24:30.999
I will lose my licence.

24:31.000 --> 24:34.320
The Black Dog is my life.
That and your mum.

24:36.680 --> 24:39.559
I'm scared I'd lose her.

24:39.560 --> 24:41.959
You'd sooner be charged with murder?

24:41.960 --> 24:43.680
I don't know what choice I got.

24:46.800 --> 24:49.159
Brian's already e-mailed the
paperwork.

24:49.160 --> 24:52.879
Actually, I wanted to talk to you
about Tam.

24:52.880 --> 24:54.200
It wasn't an accident.

24:55.800 --> 24:58.599
Is it true you knew about
the tunnel?

24:58.600 --> 25:00.679
You've been talking to Mick?

25:00.680 --> 25:02.439
Yeah, I knew.

25:02.440 --> 25:04.479
And what about Brian?
Did you tell him?

25:04.480 --> 25:05.639
No.

25:05.640 --> 25:07.919
Even though he was building on
the cliff above it?

25:07.920 --> 25:09.879
Why do you think I got Tam to move
the conservatory

25:09.880 --> 25:11.799
to the other side of the pub?

25:11.800 --> 25:13.239
And for your information,

25:13.240 --> 25:16.760
I was at home all night with Brian
and our Lucy was at a party.

25:22.480 --> 25:23.760
Oh. Bad time?

25:24.840 --> 25:26.599
No, it's fine. We're done.

25:26.600 --> 25:27.959
I kept getting your machine.

25:27.960 --> 25:30.919
I wanted to make sure Brian will be
back on-site in the morning.

25:30.920 --> 25:34.239
I thought... We were planning to
take a couple of days off.

25:34.240 --> 25:35.479
Out of respect.

25:35.480 --> 25:39.279
Tam would've wanted his pub finished
and reopened for business.

25:39.280 --> 25:40.440
We'll see you tomorrow.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.119
Why is Da...
Look what you've done!

25:49.120 --> 25:51.399
I've got a DCI breathing
down my neck.

25:51.400 --> 25:53.359
He's got wind that Mick's not
exactly a stranger.

25:53.360 --> 25:55.119
So now they're ransacking my house!

25:55.120 --> 25:57.639
This is where he was last night
Judith. I've got no choice, love!

25:57.640 --> 26:00.519
Well, you won't find anything,
so you might as well bog off.

26:00.520 --> 26:03.479
And don't think of stepping into the
Black Dog, cos you're barred!

26:03.480 --> 26:04.559
Mum, you can't bar him.

26:04.560 --> 26:05.879
I'm in the Black Dog darts team!

26:05.880 --> 26:09.160
You step one foot in Mick's pub and
I'll throw darts at you!

26:11.400 --> 26:12.600
I need to tell you something.

26:17.960 --> 26:20.799
But you've got to promise me you'll
keep this to yourself for now.

26:20.800 --> 26:22.040
All right. What is it?

26:23.080 --> 26:25.439
Mick knew about the tunnel.

26:25.440 --> 26:26.479
Sarge.

26:26.480 --> 26:27.639
Yeah?

26:27.640 --> 26:28.680
Two seconds.

26:39.120 --> 26:41.319
Mum... Don't!

26:41.320 --> 26:42.799
It's your fault Mick's in trouble!

26:42.800 --> 26:44.759
I'm trying to get him out of
trouble, but I need you

26:44.760 --> 26:45.959
to calm down and help me.

26:45.960 --> 26:47.880
How can I calm down when
he's locked up?!

26:53.040 --> 26:55.479
Mum, you've known Tam for years.

26:55.480 --> 26:57.759
Can you think of anyone who
would wish him harm?

26:57.760 --> 26:58.800
I dunno.

27:02.680 --> 27:04.080
Have you spoken to his daughter?

27:06.080 --> 27:07.559
Lucy? I thought they got on.

27:07.560 --> 27:10.679
They did, but I've seen the people
she hangs out with.

27:10.680 --> 27:14.199
If she got into trouble and
Tam got involved...

27:14.200 --> 27:15.920
He'd do anything to protect her.

27:17.200 --> 27:19.279
She was at a party all night.

27:19.280 --> 27:20.320
Lucy?

27:21.400 --> 27:22.440
Not all night.

27:23.800 --> 27:26.479
Well, she was at Freya's, but she
left early to meet some bloke.

27:26.480 --> 27:27.560
What time?

27:28.560 --> 27:29.960
Don't know. About two?

27:32.640 --> 27:34.440
Found this in the bins outside.

27:35.440 --> 27:36.480
It's Tam's.

27:42.760 --> 27:44.919
I can't get hold of your mother.

27:44.920 --> 27:47.719
Let her know what's going on,
and tell her I'm OK.

27:47.720 --> 27:48.840
'Yeah. Of course.'

27:49.880 --> 27:53.079
Listen, Mick, how did Tam's phone
end up in Mum's bin?

27:53.080 --> 27:55.119
I've never touched his phone.

27:55.120 --> 27:56.839
My prints on it? No.

27:56.840 --> 27:58.559
So then why was it in Mum's bin?

27:58.560 --> 28:00.239
I'm being set up!

28:00.240 --> 28:01.999
Then tell Davey the truth.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.639
What, and risk losing your mum
and my pub?

28:04.640 --> 28:06.479
I need you to prove it wasn't me.

28:06.480 --> 28:07.520
Look, I'm trying!

28:09.920 --> 28:11.639
Is there anything
you're not telling me?

28:11.640 --> 28:13.759
You still think I'm guilty.

28:13.760 --> 28:15.399
How long have you known me?

28:15.400 --> 28:16.919
I believe you.

28:16.920 --> 28:18.679
Why am I not convinced?

28:18.680 --> 28:20.800
You're an idiot, but you're not
that much of an idiot.

28:21.840 --> 28:24.119
So, find out who killed Tam and get
me out of here.

28:24.120 --> 28:25.520
Look, I've got to go.

28:27.520 --> 28:29.079
Hey. Hey.

28:29.080 --> 28:31.799
Custody sergeant's keeping Mick in
while we investigate.

28:31.800 --> 28:33.879
Yeah, I know.

28:33.880 --> 28:35.919
I phoned the station earlier.

28:35.920 --> 28:37.679
What you doing out here?

28:37.680 --> 28:38.760
Hiding from Mum.

28:39.720 --> 28:41.479
You want to go and get
a coffee or something?

28:41.480 --> 28:43.879
Actually, there's...
there's something I need to do.

28:43.880 --> 28:45.840
OK, I'll catch you later then.

28:56.520 --> 28:58.839
So, the night your dad died...

28:58.840 --> 29:00.559
I was at the Black Dog with him,

29:00.560 --> 29:03.359
then I went to Freya Taylor's
house for a party.

29:03.360 --> 29:06.359
It was lame,
but most things are around here.

29:06.360 --> 29:07.600
I was there all night.

29:08.680 --> 29:09.919
All night?

29:09.920 --> 29:11.279
Yeah.

29:11.280 --> 29:12.320
Why?

29:13.400 --> 29:14.919
A witness saw you leaving.

29:14.920 --> 29:17.079
Well, they must've made a mistake.

29:17.080 --> 29:18.919
To meet a man.

29:18.920 --> 29:20.759
You mean Beth?

29:20.760 --> 29:23.359
She weren't exactly compos mentis.

29:23.360 --> 29:25.359
I'm aware she'd had a couple
of drinks.

29:25.360 --> 29:26.759
More than a couple.

29:26.760 --> 29:28.199
That's why she stayed over.

29:28.200 --> 29:29.360
Scared you'd notice.

29:32.080 --> 29:33.879
I was hoping we could talk
off-the-record,

29:33.880 --> 29:35.760
but maybe you should talk
to the police.

29:40.440 --> 29:41.480
All right!

29:42.560 --> 29:44.519
I popped out to see someone -

29:44.520 --> 29:46.039
but only for a bit.

29:46.040 --> 29:47.439
Who?

29:47.440 --> 29:49.239
You can't tell anyone.

29:49.240 --> 29:50.599
Scott.

29:50.600 --> 29:52.679
Your stepbrother, Scott Poole?

29:52.680 --> 29:53.720
Yeah.

29:55.120 --> 29:56.679
Not like that!

29:56.680 --> 29:59.799
Scott's labouring all day, then
he's going to his night classes.

29:59.800 --> 30:00.879
He's too tired to go out,

30:00.880 --> 30:03.479
so now he's miserable
cos he's never seeing his mates.

30:03.480 --> 30:04.600
A friend of mine sells...

30:05.920 --> 30:07.719
You know... Drugs?

30:07.720 --> 30:08.880
Legal highs.

30:09.960 --> 30:11.919
Well, they used to be legal.

30:11.920 --> 30:13.239
Something to perk him up a bit.

30:13.240 --> 30:15.119
I dread to think.

30:15.120 --> 30:16.999
You're not going to tell my mum?

30:17.000 --> 30:19.119
I've told Scott I'm not getting it
for him no more.

30:19.120 --> 30:21.839
Do you know, right now,
my priorities are elsewhere.

30:21.840 --> 30:24.239
But I've seen enough dead
drug addicts to last a lifetime,

30:24.240 --> 30:26.239
so if I even suspect you're dealing,

30:26.240 --> 30:28.639
I will get the police to come down
on you like a tonne of bricks.

30:28.640 --> 30:29.800
Is that clear?

30:35.920 --> 30:39.080
Surveyor reckons this tunnel's
showing no further signs of stress.

30:40.120 --> 30:41.160
So...

30:42.280 --> 30:44.520
Don't you have specialist teams for
this sort of thing?

30:45.960 --> 30:48.120
Yeah, we do -
if you want to wait all week.

30:49.480 --> 30:51.720
You're the one who wanted to be kept
in the loop.

30:53.040 --> 30:54.120
Or are you scared?

30:57.800 --> 31:00.439
Any intelligent woman would hesitate
before climbing into

31:00.440 --> 31:01.960
a confined space with you.

31:06.400 --> 31:09.599
Beats going home and facing Mum.
I think.

31:09.600 --> 31:11.760
In that case, ladies first.

31:12.720 --> 31:13.880
You're so kind.

31:24.520 --> 31:27.680
Why are people so obsessed with
secret tunnels anyway?

31:28.960 --> 31:32.479
Must be something kind of Freudian
about the whole thing.

31:32.480 --> 31:33.759
It's like... Sh!

31:33.760 --> 31:35.240
I just meant... No, no, shush!

31:36.400 --> 31:37.640
I think I heard something.

31:40.560 --> 31:41.640
No, maybe not.

31:42.680 --> 31:43.760
Rat!

31:46.880 --> 31:47.920
Idiot!

31:48.920 --> 31:50.520
Whose idea was this anyway?

32:00.840 --> 32:02.519
What do you think you're doing?

32:02.520 --> 32:04.439
We're already behind schedule!

32:04.440 --> 32:07.199
The police have told us to
stop work.

32:07.200 --> 32:08.239
Why?

32:08.240 --> 32:09.480
They're searching the tunnel.

32:11.640 --> 32:13.400
All right, just mind your
step there.

32:16.920 --> 32:18.279
You all right?

32:18.280 --> 32:20.160
Yeah. You just seem a bit quiet.

32:21.200 --> 32:22.760
You got something on your mind?

32:25.200 --> 32:26.599
Come on, I know you.

32:26.600 --> 32:27.679
Spill.

32:27.680 --> 32:28.799
Nothing.

32:28.800 --> 32:30.000
Hey, look!

32:33.040 --> 32:34.120
That's a footprint.

32:35.520 --> 32:39.119
If the surveyors marked that out,
that means that's not one of theirs.

32:39.120 --> 32:40.519
Tam's?

32:40.520 --> 32:42.480
No, he was wearing trainers
when they found him.

32:43.520 --> 32:44.680
That is a boot print.

32:46.840 --> 32:48.720
And a big one, too, by the look
of it.

32:52.400 --> 32:53.600
It wasn't Mick.

33:02.520 --> 33:03.760
End of the line.

33:09.600 --> 33:11.359
Smells like fireworks.

33:11.360 --> 33:12.400
Yeah.

33:13.640 --> 33:14.840
Hey, you don't think...?

33:15.920 --> 33:17.000
Oh, hello.

33:28.560 --> 33:29.759
Fuse wire.

33:29.760 --> 33:31.440
The tunnel didn't collapse
by itself.

33:32.480 --> 33:34.959
It would've taken someone with
expertise,

33:34.960 --> 33:36.599
access to the right materials.

33:36.600 --> 33:38.239
I didn't know the tunnel existed.

33:38.240 --> 33:39.879
Why would I blow it up?!

33:39.880 --> 33:41.479
Cover your tracks.

33:41.480 --> 33:43.119
But it didn't work.

33:43.120 --> 33:46.360
We found a footprint, so, I'm going
to need to examine your work-boots.

33:47.440 --> 33:48.959
I'm not taking the blame for this.

33:48.960 --> 33:50.439
Not after what she did.

33:50.440 --> 33:51.719
By she, you mean?

33:51.720 --> 33:52.759
Roz.

33:52.760 --> 33:55.319
I heard her sneaking out of the
house during the night.

33:55.320 --> 33:58.199
I was worried. She's not been
herself so I followed her.

33:58.200 --> 33:59.719
To the pub?

33:59.720 --> 34:01.999
I saw her climb down into the well.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.520
I had to know what was going on.

34:06.600 --> 34:07.959
You!

34:07.960 --> 34:09.559
Why?

34:09.560 --> 34:11.719
It was a mistake.

34:11.719 --> 34:13.279
I'm sorry.

34:13.280 --> 34:14.360
Look, I love you!

34:16.520 --> 34:17.679
What're you going to do?

34:17.679 --> 34:19.438
It's OK.

34:19.440 --> 34:20.958
You don't need to say anything else.

34:20.960 --> 34:23.279
In fact, we're never going to talk
about this again.

34:23.280 --> 34:24.320
Agreed?

34:29.080 --> 34:30.560
Go home. I'll sort this.

34:36.840 --> 34:38.280
Everything's going to be all right.

34:44.880 --> 34:47.119
So, you blew the tunnel to
cover for her?

34:47.120 --> 34:49.958
With the tunnel sealed off, people'd
think the body washed up there.

34:49.960 --> 34:51.480
Nobody'd link it back to Roz.

34:53.159 --> 34:55.000
Only I didn't count on the rock
fall.

34:56.400 --> 34:58.839
So what was she doing there with Tam
in the first place?

34:58.840 --> 35:01.039
I think we can all take
a stab in the dark.

35:01.040 --> 35:03.679
So you covered for her,
even though she was cheating on you?

35:03.680 --> 35:04.720
I love her.

35:05.680 --> 35:08.840
Not like Tam. He snapped his
fingers and women came running.

35:11.240 --> 35:15.080
I guess she tried to end it, they
argued, he slipped, fell, I dunno.

35:16.400 --> 35:17.800
Hard to be jealous of a dead man.

35:20.080 --> 35:21.160
Where's Roz now?

35:22.160 --> 35:24.119
She went upstairs for a lie down.

35:24.120 --> 35:25.400
Said she wasn't feeling well.

35:41.640 --> 35:42.960
Don't forget your toothbrush.

35:44.480 --> 35:46.479
Your old boyfriend caught you
red-handed!

35:46.480 --> 35:47.720
He's lying!

35:49.640 --> 35:52.879
Hidden in a book in your
bedside table.

35:52.880 --> 35:54.479
Fits a padlock to the tunnel
entrance -

35:54.480 --> 35:56.200
a padlock with your fingerprints
on it.

35:57.160 --> 35:58.480
And we also found this.

35:59.640 --> 36:02.599
It matches the call that you
made to Tam's mobile.

36:02.600 --> 36:04.000
You'd arranged to meet him.

36:05.400 --> 36:06.679
Yes.

36:06.680 --> 36:08.080
Why? Because...

36:09.920 --> 36:13.159
When I walked out on Tam,
I meant it.

36:13.160 --> 36:14.919
I hated him.

36:14.920 --> 36:18.159
Working together behind that bar
all day, all night. I mean, it got

36:18.160 --> 36:20.879
to the point when just the silliest
little thing annoyed each other.

36:20.880 --> 36:21.920
But recently...

36:22.880 --> 36:24.720
..seeing each other every day,
it was...

36:25.840 --> 36:27.519
..it was like we were kids again.

36:27.520 --> 36:29.040
Couldn't keep our eyes off
each other.

36:30.280 --> 36:33.280
Tam was planning to divorce Claire.

36:34.360 --> 36:37.840
Then, when that was sorted, I was
going to move back into the pub.

36:40.480 --> 36:44.120
Only Brian killed him before
we had the chance.

36:45.080 --> 36:46.439
Brian killed him?

36:46.440 --> 36:49.399
Well, he must. He must've found
out about the affair.

36:49.400 --> 36:52.959
Did you see him?
No, but he must have. He was there.

36:52.960 --> 36:54.399
Then why didn't you call the police?

36:54.400 --> 36:56.519
Because I was scared!

36:56.520 --> 37:00.719
Brian freaked out when he saw your
lot heading down the tunnel earlier.

37:00.720 --> 37:02.639
I didn't know what he was planning.

37:02.640 --> 37:04.599
Right, so you're saying that Brian
killed Tam and

37:04.600 --> 37:05.999
he's saying that you did it.

37:06.000 --> 37:07.759
So, who do I believe?

37:07.760 --> 37:10.799
And if you're planning a romantic
liaison, why choose the cove?

37:10.800 --> 37:12.679
Not exactly convenient, is it?

37:12.680 --> 37:13.759
Or comfortable.

37:13.760 --> 37:15.679
It's where we fell in love.

37:15.680 --> 37:16.760
The first time.

37:17.840 --> 37:19.639
On my 18th,

37:19.640 --> 37:23.319
Tam promised that one day he'd
buy me that pub on the clifftop,

37:23.320 --> 37:24.840
so we could have that view forever.

37:26.600 --> 37:28.000
I thought he was joking.

37:31.120 --> 37:33.399
Try to leave everything where
you found it.

37:33.400 --> 37:34.600
I will, of course.

37:45.720 --> 37:47.400
Hey. Got your message.

37:49.000 --> 37:50.640
Have you told
Claire about the affair?

37:52.520 --> 37:53.599
No.

37:53.600 --> 37:55.680
I want evidence that Roz is
telling the truth first.

37:56.760 --> 37:59.759
The lads have picked up Brian,
but he's sticking to his story.

37:59.760 --> 38:02.399
Not exactly the happy ending Tam and
Roz were hoping for.

38:02.400 --> 38:04.359
You know what they say about
relationships.

38:04.360 --> 38:06.200
You can never really go back,
can you?

38:11.480 --> 38:13.839
You know, they're both assuming that
the other one did it,

38:13.840 --> 38:15.800
but what if it was someone else?

38:16.800 --> 38:17.839
Like who?

38:17.840 --> 38:21.919
Well, maybe Tam told Claire
he was divorcing her and

38:21.920 --> 38:23.120
she didn't take it very well?

38:24.200 --> 38:26.199
Claire's got a history of
panic attacks brought on

38:26.200 --> 38:27.759
by claustrophobia.

38:27.760 --> 38:29.279
So, even if she wanted Tam dead,

38:29.280 --> 38:31.280
she wouldn't have followed him down
the tunnel.

38:33.560 --> 38:34.640
Lie on the bed.

38:35.600 --> 38:38.080
Well, I'm very flattered, but...
Lie on the bed!

38:39.960 --> 38:41.120
Seriously?

38:51.840 --> 38:52.879
Hear that?

38:52.880 --> 38:54.080
Er, yeah.

38:57.600 --> 38:58.679
And that?

38:58.680 --> 38:59.720
Yeah, same.

39:02.320 --> 39:04.959
Claire said she heard Tam's
footsteps on the stairs

39:04.960 --> 39:07.479
at three, but, according to Roz,

39:07.480 --> 39:09.159
Tam would've been dead already.

39:09.160 --> 39:12.039
Well, maybe she got the time wrong.
Or it wasn't him leaving.

39:12.040 --> 39:13.440
It was someone else coming back.

39:15.760 --> 39:17.640
But there was only one other
person in the pub.

39:33.000 --> 39:34.879
All by yourself?

39:34.880 --> 39:37.639
Yeah. The rest of the lads have
packed up till they know

39:37.640 --> 39:39.119
what's happening with Roz and Brian.

39:39.120 --> 39:41.559
Oh, right, so you're just taking
the initiative, huh?

39:41.560 --> 39:43.319
Looking out for your mum?

39:43.320 --> 39:45.959
I mean, after all,
all this is hers now, right?

39:45.960 --> 39:47.039
Sorry, what...

39:47.040 --> 39:48.879
You found out about the affair,
didn't you?

39:48.880 --> 39:50.799
Between your stepfather and
his ex-wife.

39:50.800 --> 39:53.039
You were coming home from buying
your little pick-me-up

39:53.040 --> 39:54.719
when you saw Tam sneaking down
the tunnel.

39:54.720 --> 39:55.959
You knew what he was up to...

39:55.960 --> 39:57.559
You've lost me.

39:57.560 --> 39:59.319
We found a footprint.

39:59.320 --> 40:02.079
We thought it might be Brian's, but
his feet are the wrong size.

40:02.080 --> 40:04.599
Yours, however? Perfect fit.

40:04.600 --> 40:06.680
You went to my mum's house to
plant the phone.

40:07.600 --> 40:08.920
Keep the police focused on Mick.

40:10.440 --> 40:12.599
Wow, you must really love
your mother.

40:12.600 --> 40:15.159
Scott Poole, I'm arresting you on
suspicion of the murder

40:15.160 --> 40:16.920
of Tam Bryant. You do...

40:18.320 --> 40:19.759
Davey! Agh, agh.

40:19.760 --> 40:20.880
Yeah, get him.

40:36.920 --> 40:38.159
Whoa! Whoa!

40:38.160 --> 40:39.320
Down! Put it down!

40:41.160 --> 40:43.079
Put that down!
You don't want to hurt anyone.

40:43.080 --> 40:44.279
It was his fault!

40:44.280 --> 40:47.239
What did he do?
My father treated my mum like dirt.

40:47.240 --> 40:50.479
It took her years to get over him,
to trust someone again.

40:50.480 --> 40:52.599
I thought that Tam was different,
but he wasn't.

40:52.600 --> 40:54.480
When I saw him and Roz...

41:07.000 --> 41:08.159
All right, you were angry?

41:08.160 --> 41:10.320
I just wanted to tell him what
a mistake he was making.

41:14.640 --> 41:16.199
What are you doing down here?

41:16.200 --> 41:17.359
How could you do this?

41:17.360 --> 41:20.320
Do what? You swore to me
that you would never hurt her.

41:21.480 --> 41:22.559
You've got this all wrong.

41:22.560 --> 41:24.599
Don't touch me. I saw you!

41:24.600 --> 41:26.680
If you say a word to your mother...

41:48.400 --> 41:49.480
It just happened.

41:52.080 --> 41:54.159
Back off! Scott, you don't want to
do this.

41:54.160 --> 41:55.519
I said stay back!

41:55.520 --> 41:57.519
You're not thinking clearly.
This is the pills.

41:57.520 --> 41:58.600
Scott?

42:01.040 --> 42:02.439
Stay back!

42:02.440 --> 42:03.800
Get off me!

42:06.160 --> 42:07.479
No! Get off!

42:07.480 --> 42:09.759
Scott Poole, I'm arresting you on
suspicion of the murder

42:09.760 --> 42:10.840
of Tam Bryant.

42:19.840 --> 42:21.720
If it's more of that slop,
I'm not interested.

42:25.120 --> 42:26.360
How about a pint then?

42:30.560 --> 42:31.839
Look, Davey, you were right.

42:31.840 --> 42:34.119
I did have something on my mind.

42:34.120 --> 42:36.359
Mick asked me to keep a secret
and... It's fine.

42:36.360 --> 42:38.159
No, I don't want you to
think that I...

42:38.160 --> 42:40.839
Listen, I don't... I trust you.
It's fine. Really?

42:40.840 --> 42:42.479
Yeah. We're good?

42:42.480 --> 42:43.520
We're good.

42:46.920 --> 42:48.479
Ah, Mick.

42:48.480 --> 42:51.039
Only kind of bars you want
to be behind, eh?

42:51.040 --> 42:53.520
Listen, mate, I'm sorry about,
you know...

42:55.160 --> 42:57.280
Oh, yeah. You were only doing
your jobs.

42:58.960 --> 43:00.000
What'll it be?

43:01.240 --> 43:02.919
Oh, well, I can't actually.
Annette...

43:02.920 --> 43:04.639
On the house.

43:04.640 --> 43:06.119
Go on, then, I'll have a pint.

43:06.120 --> 43:07.839
I'll have a white wine, please.

43:07.840 --> 43:10.799
Er, since we're doling out the
forgiveness, can I be off the hook?

43:10.800 --> 43:13.439
Er, when I've decided you're truly
sorry for staying out

43:13.440 --> 43:14.759
all night without permission.

43:14.760 --> 43:16.919
Hey, I remember you sneaking out
once or twice.

43:16.920 --> 43:17.959
Davey!

43:17.960 --> 43:21.400
First, that's gross. And second,
you are such a hypocrite!

43:22.520 --> 43:25.040
Right, yeah. Well, clear those away
and we'll call it quits.

43:27.760 --> 43:29.439
I said you're barred!

43:29.440 --> 43:30.919
I told him... And as for you...

43:30.920 --> 43:32.199
Look, Mum, I'm sorry...

43:32.200 --> 43:35.639
While this lump had his feet up
in that cell,

43:35.640 --> 43:37.079
I had to pull a triple-shift!

43:37.080 --> 43:38.199
Well, never mind all that,

43:38.200 --> 43:42.399
how about my plan about winning next
year's Best West Country Pub of the Year...

43:42.400 --> 43:44.439
Quizaoke?

43:44.440 --> 43:47.039
Teams answer trivia questions and
get points by singing

43:47.040 --> 43:49.199
their favourite songs!

43:49.200 --> 43:50.399
Great! Love it!

43:50.400 --> 43:51.439
Sure.

43:51.440 --> 43:52.479
Yeah!

43:52.480 --> 43:53.720
Right, well...

43:55.880 --> 43:58.439
To Tam,
the shameless old heller.

43:58.440 --> 44:00.759
Every man needs a good enemy.

44:00.760 --> 44:03.040
Tam! Tam! Tam!
