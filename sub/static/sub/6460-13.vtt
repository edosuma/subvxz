10:04.104 --> 10:06.671
I'm running behind,
so you need to order me lunch.

10:06.673 --> 10:09.007
I want a kale salad
with a side of kale

10:09.009 --> 10:11.876
and a kale shake, and tomorrow
better book me a kale-onic.

10:13.779 --> 10:14.980
Caroline,
what are you doing?

10:14.982 --> 10:16.615
You're dressed
all wrong.

10:16.617 --> 10:18.316
Yours is a "riches to rags"
story,

10:18.318 --> 10:20.986
a story we'll never sell
if you go in there wearing that.

10:20.988 --> 10:22.787
I have a huge hole
near the crotch

10:22.789 --> 10:24.089
in my panty hose,
if that helps.

10:24.091 --> 10:26.157
It doesn't.

10:26.159 --> 10:30.695
You need to look broke,
busted, discarded from society.

10:31.731 --> 10:33.264
Put on what she's wearing.

10:33.266 --> 10:35.133
Fine,

10:35.135 --> 10:39.204

that stupid nurse cape.

10:46.647 --> 10:50.181
That dress looks cute on you,
all three of you.

10:50.183 --> 10:52.283
I know.
Ugh, look at this.

10:52.285 --> 10:55.687
It's like my first day
of kindergarten.

10:55.689 --> 10:57.255
Hi.

10:57.257 --> 10:59.858
It's been two hours.
Is he maybe ready yet?

10:59.860 --> 11:02.027
Absolutely.
We're so excited.

11:03.362 --> 11:06.631
Fine, but these
are about to blow.

11:06.633 --> 11:09.934
So don't come crying to me when
you're blinded by boob buttons.

11:09.936 --> 11:13.038
Something in your shirt
is itching me.

11:14.674 --> 11:17.275
Why is there a joint
in your shirt?

11:17.277 --> 11:19.277
I think that's obvious.

11:19.279 --> 11:22.313
It fell down from my hair.

11:22.315 --> 11:26.051
Good thing you found it
and not those TSA party poopers.

11:26.053 --> 11:27.352

11:27.354 --> 11:28.753

Where? Where it it?

11:28.755 --> 11:30.922
Oh, I put it here
in your front pocket.

11:30.924 --> 11:33.058
Oh, cool, there's never
room there when I wear it.

11:33.060 --> 11:35.060
See, Max,
I knew he'd call you.

11:35.062 --> 11:36.895
- Well, he said he would.
- And he will.

11:36.897 --> 11:39.698
But right now,
this is Sophie.

11:39.700 --> 11:40.999
Hi, Sophie.

11:41.001 --> 11:42.801
<i>How's the adoption going?</i>

11:42.803 --> 11:47.005
Did you find a 16-year-old
who really let her parents down?

11:47.007 --> 11:50.241
Hey, Earl,
where is Oleg right now?

11:50.243 --> 11:52.277
He just went to the men's room

11:52.279 --> 11:56.014
with the bra ads
from today's paper.

11:56.016 --> 11:59.417
Okay,
I have 45 minutes.

12:01.320 --> 12:02.887
<i>But the thing is,</i>

12:02.889 --> 12:07.025
I still want the baby
to look like me.

12:07.027 --> 12:11.763
Well you can put hair extensions
on anything.

12:11.765 --> 12:15.133
Are you saying
that I shouldn't adopt

12:15.135 --> 12:18.703
and I should keep trying to have
my own baby?

12:18.705 --> 12:22.240
Ohh, I've got go Sophie,
our 4:00 2:00 meeting is on.

12:22.242 --> 12:23.742
That's a wrap for today,
Quan.

12:23.744 --> 12:25.677
Wait, he's just
gonna leave

12:25.679 --> 12:27.245
and not acknowledge
our existence?

12:27.247 --> 12:28.780
I can't believe this.

12:28.782 --> 12:30.882
They're treating me
like they know who I am.

12:30.884 --> 12:32.117
Mr. Tyler.

12:32.119 --> 12:33.418
Hi, Caroline Channing.

12:33.420 --> 12:34.919
We were supposed to have
a meeting.

12:34.921 --> 12:36.855
Quick refresher:
lost my billions

12:36.857 --> 12:40.792
but not my plucky can-do
attitude against all odds.

12:40.794 --> 12:43.294
I'm Max.
I'm the odds.

12:43.296 --> 12:46.164
Oh, yeah, you're the sad,
dejected, destitute girl.

12:46.166 --> 12:48.833
That's me,
the destitute girl.

12:48.835 --> 12:51.169
So sorry.
Today got away from me.

12:51.171 --> 12:53.905
Ryan Murphy can talk.

12:53.907 --> 12:55.740
I'll have my office
call you tomorrow.

12:55.742 --> 12:56.975
Call her?

12:56.977 --> 12:58.376
Call her?

12:58.378 --> 12:59.944
Why don't you just
tell her the truth,

12:59.946 --> 13:01.479
that she's never gonna
hear from you,

13:01.481 --> 13:03.848
the movie's never gonna happen,
and like every other man

13:03.850 --> 13:06.718
in this town, you're full of
crap and silver jewelry.

13:08.120 --> 13:09.754
Well, okay then.

13:09.756 --> 13:12.123
So sorry to have
kept you waiting.

13:12.125 --> 13:14.325
Quan, set them up with another
appointment tomorrow.

13:17.363 --> 13:19.364
And this is platinum.

13:20.966 --> 13:23.001
He's really gonna
meet with us, right?

13:23.003 --> 13:26.104
Absolutely. Set in stone.
We're so excited.

13:27.139 --> 13:29.440
So never gonna happen.

13:29.442 --> 13:31.176
What do we do now?

13:31.178 --> 13:34.846
Well, as I said on my first day
of kindergarten...

13:34.848 --> 13:36.848
it's recess.

13:41.353 --> 13:42.687
There you are.

13:42.689 --> 13:44.856
Drinking alone at a bar
in the morning.

13:44.858 --> 13:48.193
Did we switch bodies
when we switched clothes?

13:48.195 --> 13:51.129
It's 5:00 somewhere.

13:51.131 --> 13:53.598
Oh, my God.
Maybe we have.

13:53.600 --> 13:56.634
I just needed a few sips
to calm myself down.

13:56.636 --> 13:59.704
Look, I'm really sorry
I lost it on that studio guy.

13:59.706 --> 14:03.308
And I guess running behind
his car and begging didn't work.

14:03.310 --> 14:06.678
Wow, even apologizing in LA
is healthy.

14:06.680 --> 14:09.214
There's still a chance; Nina's
meeting with Perry right now.

14:09.216 --> 14:11.182
Maybe she'll smooth
everything over,

14:11.184 --> 14:14.185
like everybody does here
with their faces.

14:14.187 --> 14:16.421
Oh, Claude, hi,
Caroline Channing.

14:16.423 --> 14:18.289
Lawrence put me on the list
for a table.

14:18.291 --> 14:21.626
And I'm Max Black,
your worst nightmare.

14:21.628 --> 14:24.195
One moment.

14:24.197 --> 14:26.497
So aggressive.
What is the problem?

14:26.499 --> 14:28.900
I'm guessing
low self-esteem.

14:28.902 --> 14:31.636
Not him.
I'm talking about you.

14:31.638 --> 14:34.706
I'm guessing low self-esteem.

14:34.708 --> 14:36.441
Nina, hi.

14:36.443 --> 14:38.443
I didn't realize your meeting
with Perry was here.

14:38.445 --> 14:40.778
God, it's like everyone
in Hollywood is here.

14:40.780 --> 14:42.881
Yes, for about another month.

14:42.883 --> 14:44.515
Then this place
will be as empty

14:44.517 --> 14:46.484
as Keira Knightley's
refrigerator.

14:48.254 --> 14:50.488
So I just talked to Perry,
and looks like

14:50.490 --> 14:52.724
he was really offended
by you yesterday.

14:52.726 --> 14:56.461
Uh, I'm sure people have said
worse things to that man.

14:56.463 --> 14:59.564
I mean, his license plate says,
"Makin' Movies."

15:00.866 --> 15:02.934
Max, you can't have
an attitude like that

15:02.936 --> 15:05.303
and not get buried
in Hollywood.

15:05.305 --> 15:07.238
Nina.

15:07.240 --> 15:08.539
Just ask Claude.

15:08.541 --> 15:10.541
He used to run Paramount.

15:12.745 --> 15:14.412
It's over?

15:14.414 --> 15:16.314
I came all this way
to be disappointed

15:16.316 --> 15:18.349
by a rich guy
in Hollywood?

15:18.351 --> 15:22.186
I could have just seen
a Kevin Hart movie.

15:22.188 --> 15:23.821
I'm sorry.

15:23.823 --> 15:26.824
I better go sign for these
drinks while they're still free.

15:29.728 --> 15:32.697
Claude, Claude, look,

15:32.699 --> 15:34.465
I know you and I
haven't gotten along,

15:34.467 --> 15:35.767
but quick fave.

15:35.769 --> 15:37.535
I need to fix something
for my friend.

15:37.537 --> 15:40.471
Can I just go over there
and talk to that guy, please?

15:40.473 --> 15:42.473
Are you on the list?

15:42.475 --> 15:44.709
I've never been on the list.

15:49.682 --> 15:51.482
I can do this all day,
sweetheart.

15:51.484 --> 15:53.685
I'm a gay rumba champion.

16:04.563 --> 16:06.831
Hi, I'm Max.
I'll be your server.

16:06.833 --> 16:08.666

"please don't ruin

16:08.668 --> 16:11.336
my friend Caroline's chance,
it's all my fault."

16:12.871 --> 16:15.707
And, of course,
it's vegan, no dairy.

16:15.709 --> 16:17.008
What's going on here?

16:17.010 --> 16:18.810
Sir,
I really screwed up,

16:18.812 --> 16:21.713
and as I screamed
into your muffler yesterday,

16:21.715 --> 16:23.815
I am here to beg
your forgiveness.

16:23.817 --> 16:25.350
I wasn't talking about you.

16:25.352 --> 16:28.386
I meant,
why is there bread on my table?

16:28.388 --> 16:29.721
Give her another chance.

16:29.723 --> 16:31.489
This is the first good thing
to happen to her

16:31.491 --> 16:32.991
since she lost all her money,

16:32.993 --> 16:35.793
aside from the time
the Red Cross gave us coffee.

16:37.363 --> 16:38.696
At least meet with her,

16:38.698 --> 16:41.366
so you can hear
how amazing her story is.

16:41.368 --> 16:43.735
It's a story of someone
not being defined

16:43.737 --> 16:46.270
by all the bad things that have
happened to them in the past

16:46.272 --> 16:48.606
and just moving on.

16:48.608 --> 16:50.942
I'd buy a ticket
to that.

16:50.944 --> 16:52.343

16:52.345 --> 16:54.512
Why is there bread
on your table?

to convince me

I haven't seen a waitress
this desperate

her head shot last night.

17:04.890 --> 17:06.491
Well, as your lawyer,

I recommend you give her
exactly what she wants.

and falls off the terrace.

that you didn't call me.

20:18.918 --> 20:21.185
the old-fashioned way.

20:21.187 --> 20:24.689
Well, it turns out
all of these Hollywood actresses

20:24.691 --> 20:28.893
that are having babies over 40,
like Geena Davis,

20:28.895 --> 20:33.831
Jane Seymour,
Neil Patrick Harris,

20:33.833 --> 20:37.802
well, they're all going to this
big-shot healer out here,

20:37.804 --> 20:42.173
so here I am.

20:42.175 --> 20:44.175
It's cool if I stay with you,
right?

20:44.177 --> 20:46.277
- Absolutely.
- Set in stone.

20:46.279 --> 20:49.113
(both)
We're so excited.
