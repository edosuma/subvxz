WEBVTT

00:03.294 --> 00:05.462
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:05.630 --> 00:07.631
Hey.

00:07.799 --> 00:11.427
So, what happened?
Did a forest tick you off?

00:12.303 --> 00:13.345
No.

00:13.513 --> 00:16.473
You know how we're always saying
we need a place for the mail.

00:19.644 --> 00:21.478
Yeah.

00:21.855 --> 00:23.188
Well, I started building one.

00:23.356 --> 00:27.067
But then I decided to take it
to the next step.

00:28.111 --> 00:30.571
You're building a post office?

00:31.489 --> 00:34.700
No, an entertainment unit,
with a mail cubby built right in.

00:34.868 --> 00:38.412
- It's a one-day job, max.
- Okay.

00:39.164 --> 00:42.041
My word, those are snug.

00:43.501 --> 00:46.086
Oh, yeah. These are my old work pants.

00:46.254 --> 00:48.464
Sergio Valente.

00:58.016 --> 01:00.809
Power saw kind of got away
from me there.

01:53.029 --> 01:54.363
- Hey, Pheebs.
- Hey.

01:54.531 --> 01:57.658
- Any sign of your brother?
- No, but he's always late, so...

01:57.826 --> 02:00.244
- I thought you only met him once.
- Yeah, I did.

02:01.871 --> 02:05.332
I think it sounds, you know, big sister-y,
"Frank's always late." So...

02:05.500 --> 02:08.001
Oh. Well, relax. He'll be here.

02:08.169 --> 02:10.753
- Yeah, no, I know. I'm just nervous.
- Oh.

02:10.922 --> 02:14.133
You know, it's just, you know, Mom's dead,
don't talk to my sister...

02:14.300 --> 02:16.844
...Grandma's been sleeping
a lot lately.

02:17.512 --> 02:20.722
It's just the "last desperate chance
to have a family" kind of thing.

02:20.890 --> 02:23.392
- Mm.
- You're so sweet to wait with me.

02:23.560 --> 02:27.479
Well, actually, Gunther sent me.
You're not allowed to have cups out here.

02:30.567 --> 02:33.110
Does anyone else think
David Copperfield's cute?

02:35.238 --> 02:38.448
No, but he told me he thinks you're a fox.

02:40.243 --> 02:41.910
All right. Janice likes him.

02:42.078 --> 02:46.081
In fact, she likes him so much,
she put him on her, uh, freebie list.

02:49.586 --> 02:50.627
Her what?

02:50.795 --> 02:55.799
We have a deal where we each pick five
different celebrities we could sleep with...

02:56.759 --> 02:58.927
...and the other one can't get mad.

02:59.095 --> 03:02.306
Ah, the heart
of every healthy relationship:

03:02.473 --> 03:06.351
Honesty, respect,
and sex with celebrities.

03:06.519 --> 03:08.145
So, Chandler, who's on your list?

03:08.313 --> 03:09.938
Uh, Kim Basinger...

03:10.106 --> 03:12.399
...Cindy Crawford, Halle Berry...

03:12.567 --> 03:14.443
...Yasmine Bleeth...
- Oh.

03:15.361 --> 03:17.571
...and Jessica Rabbit.

03:19.199 --> 03:23.535
Ahem. Now, you do realize that she is
a cartoon and way out of your league?

03:23.703 --> 03:27.748
I know. I just always wondered if I could
get her eyes to pop out of her head.

03:29.334 --> 03:30.959
Hey, Monica, who would yours be?

03:31.127 --> 03:33.879
First I need a boyfriend.
Then I can have a list.

03:34.797 --> 03:36.798
It's just a game, Mon.

03:38.635 --> 03:40.135
Rach, how about you?

03:40.303 --> 03:44.556
Oh, I don't know. I guess Chris O'Donnell,
John F. Kennedy Jr...

03:44.724 --> 03:48.352
...Daniel Day-Lewis, Sting
and Parker Stevenson.

03:50.146 --> 03:51.855
Spider-Man?

03:52.023 --> 03:53.857
Hardy Boy.

03:54.317 --> 03:57.110
- Peter Parker.
- Thank you.

03:57.820 --> 03:59.863
What about you, honey?
Who'd be on your list?

04:00.031 --> 04:04.201
I... Oh, that kind of thing
requires some serious thought.

04:04.369 --> 04:07.704
First, I'll divide my prospective candidates
into categories.

04:07.872 --> 04:09.414
Ahem. What a geek.

04:11.209 --> 04:14.378
Everybody, this is Frank.
This is my half brother, Frank.

04:14.545 --> 04:15.921
- This is everybody.
- Hey.

04:16.089 --> 04:17.880
- This is Ross.
- Hi, how are you?

04:18.048 --> 04:19.132
- Chandler.
- Hi.

04:19.300 --> 04:20.509
- Hi.
- Joey.

04:20.677 --> 04:22.636
- Hey.
- Hi, hi, hi.

04:22.804 --> 04:25.389
- This is Monica.
- Whoa.

04:26.808 --> 04:28.475
- And this is Rachel.
- Hi.

04:28.643 --> 04:30.185
Whoa.

04:32.272 --> 04:33.855
I'm gonna get coffee for us.

04:34.023 --> 04:37.025
Hey, how do you guys
get anything done? Ha, ha.

04:37.193 --> 04:39.069
We don't, really.

04:40.488 --> 04:42.322
Well, so do you guys have big plans?

04:42.490 --> 04:46.410
Oh, yeah. We're gonna, like, connect and,
you know, bond and everything.

04:46.577 --> 04:51.373
I was thinking we could go down to
Times Square and pick up some ninja stars.

04:51.541 --> 04:55.585
Oh, um, my friend Larry,
he wants me to take a picture of a hooker.

04:57.171 --> 05:00.215
You know, we really don't take advantage
of living in the city.

05:14.605 --> 05:16.857
Oh, sorry. Did I get you?

05:18.067 --> 05:19.401
No, you didn't get me.

05:19.569 --> 05:22.904
It's an electric drill.
You get me, you kill me!

05:23.990 --> 05:26.283
Calm down.
Do you want this unit or not?

05:26.701 --> 05:29.036
I do not want this unit.

05:29.203 --> 05:32.205
Well, you should've told me before.
I'm not a mind reader.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.044
And we're out of beer.
Okay, I'm going to Monica's.

05:37.712 --> 05:39.338
Fine.

05:45.261 --> 05:48.972
Hey. Where you heading in those pants?
1982?

05:50.725 --> 05:51.767
Oh, Monica, listen...

05:51.934 --> 05:55.604
...I saw down at the hardware store
they got those designer tiles on sale...

05:55.772 --> 05:57.689
...if you wanna redo your bathroom floor.

05:58.107 --> 06:00.233
What's wrong with my bathroom floor?

06:00.401 --> 06:03.320
Nothing.
It's just old and dingy, that's all.

06:04.197 --> 06:07.491
- I highly doubt that.
- Oh, yeah?

06:07.658 --> 06:12.412
If you move your hamper,
you can see the color the tile used to be.

06:12.580 --> 06:14.748
- Ah!
- Yeah.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.710
I can't live like this.
What are we gonna do?

06:18.878 --> 06:20.504
Relax, relax. Here, hold this.

06:20.671 --> 06:23.632
This old stuff comes right up.
I'll show you.

06:26.094 --> 06:28.470
A little more than I wanted to see.

06:31.391 --> 06:34.393
Look at that.
Every inch of this is glued down.

06:34.560 --> 06:38.146
It'd take forever to pry this up.
You should, uh... You should just leave it.

06:40.024 --> 06:44.778
I can't leave it.
You gouged a hole in my dingy floor.

06:44.946 --> 06:46.238
Uh, oh.

06:53.329 --> 06:55.997
- Ah? There you go.
- Aw.

06:56.165 --> 06:57.416
Yeah, that's nice.

06:57.583 --> 07:01.378
You know, we can put it back there after
the surgeons remove it from your colon.

07:09.637 --> 07:10.679
Ooh, ooh!

07:10.847 --> 07:11.847
- What?
- Yeah.

07:12.014 --> 07:14.433
I know what I wanted to ask you.
Can you roll your tongue?

07:15.393 --> 07:18.186
Because I can and my mom couldn't.

07:18.354 --> 07:22.065
And I thought, you know... I figured that
was something I got from our dad.

07:22.233 --> 07:25.610
- Well, wait, you mean like this?
- Yeah.

07:25.778 --> 07:27.070
Yeah, you can do it too. Yeah.

07:29.240 --> 07:30.532
You're not doing it.

07:30.700 --> 07:34.327
Oh, right, okay.
Yeah, my mom could and I can't.

07:35.538 --> 07:37.998
So we don't have that.

07:43.254 --> 07:46.089
- When's your birthday?
- February 16th.

07:46.507 --> 07:48.758
I know a guy who's the 18th.

07:50.720 --> 07:52.637
That's close.

07:53.890 --> 07:57.184
- When's yours?
- October 25th.

08:01.355 --> 08:03.940
That's the same month as Halloween.

08:04.609 --> 08:06.067
Yeah.

08:08.196 --> 08:11.281
So, what kind of things
do you like to do at home?

08:12.241 --> 08:13.617
Melt stuff.

08:18.039 --> 08:21.666
- Okay, I've got three of my five.
- Three of your five what?

08:22.210 --> 08:25.128
Celebrities I'm allowed to sleep with.

08:25.296 --> 08:27.506
God, you are giving this a lot of thought.

08:27.673 --> 08:30.300
Hey, it's hard, okay?
I only have two spots left.

08:30.468 --> 08:32.135
All right.
Who you got it narrowed down to?

08:32.303 --> 08:34.929
Okay. Ahem. Elizabeth Hurley.

08:35.097 --> 08:37.097
- Ooh, very attractive.
- Yeah.

08:37.265 --> 08:38.933
Forgiving.

08:41.145 --> 08:42.854
Susan Sarandon.

08:44.607 --> 08:46.650
Eh, you know what? She's too political.

08:46.817 --> 08:51.321
She probably wouldn't let you do it
unless you donated four cans of food first.

08:52.865 --> 08:55.116
And Isabella Rossellini.

08:55.284 --> 08:57.077
- Ooh.
- Ooh. Very hot. Very sexy.

08:57.245 --> 09:01.998
But, uh, you know, she's too international.
She's never gonna be around.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.876
- So?
- So you gotta play the odds.

09:05.044 --> 09:08.338
Pick somebody who's gonna be
in the country, like, all the time.

09:08.923 --> 09:12.592
Yeah. Because that's why you won't
get Isabella Rossellini. Geography.

09:23.479 --> 09:26.815
Okay, so by "melting,"
you meant melting.

09:27.650 --> 09:28.817
Yeah.

09:28.985 --> 09:32.195
- So is it, like, art?
- Yeah, you can melt art.

09:34.156 --> 09:36.950
- Hey, can I use your phone?
- Mm.

09:37.118 --> 09:41.538
- Yeah, sure. You wanna call your mom?
- No, I wanna melt it.

09:42.039 --> 09:44.791
Oh. Well, um, not right now.

09:50.756 --> 09:54.884
You know what? I'm just gonna go to bed.
The fumes are giving me a headache. So...

09:55.052 --> 09:58.096
Yeah. Yeah. Ha, ha.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.975
Good night, bro.

10:02.435 --> 10:03.685
Good night.

10:08.107 --> 10:09.774
Here.

10:09.942 --> 10:11.901
Just in case.

10:12.069 --> 10:14.321
Oh, excellent.

10:26.542 --> 10:30.170
- What kind of karate is that?
- No kind.

10:31.380 --> 10:33.715
- He just makes it up.
- Hmm.

10:33.883 --> 10:37.636
- So how's it going with you guys?
- So far it kind of blows.

10:41.724 --> 10:45.185
I don't know, I just thought, you know,
that he'd feel more like a brother.

10:45.353 --> 10:47.812
Like you and Ross.
Just close and connected and...

10:47.980 --> 10:50.482
Oh. We're close now,
but you wouldn't believe the years...

10:50.650 --> 10:55.612
...of noogies and wedgies and
flying wedgies and atomic wedgies and...

10:57.114 --> 10:59.824
That's when the waistband
actually goes over your head.

11:00.660 --> 11:01.910
Ah.

11:02.828 --> 11:05.121
We drove each other crazy
playing the shadow game.

11:05.289 --> 11:08.249
- How do you play the shadow game?
- How do you play the shadow game?

11:08.417 --> 11:10.627
- I just asked you.
- I just asked you.

11:10.795 --> 11:12.921
I don't have time for this.

11:13.089 --> 11:16.758
- No, that is what the game is.
- Well, you just gave up really quickly.

11:19.428 --> 11:21.262
- Have you seen Joey?
- What's the matter?

11:21.430 --> 11:23.932
Oh, just this.

11:28.646 --> 11:33.316
It's my fault, really, because the couch
is where we usually keep the varnish.

11:35.236 --> 11:37.529
Hey, somebody wanna hand me
one of those tiles?

11:39.949 --> 11:42.701
- What's going on?
- He's retiling my floor.

11:43.244 --> 11:45.954
Yo, spackle boy.

11:46.622 --> 11:49.624
- Get up.
- Ah-ah. You started this, you will finish it.

11:49.792 --> 11:51.626
He started mine first.

11:51.794 --> 11:54.754
Build the unit, Cinderellie.
Lay the tile, Cinderellie.

11:58.134 --> 11:59.634
Whoa.

11:59.802 --> 12:02.178
Big octopus.

12:03.889 --> 12:05.598
Yeah.

12:09.061 --> 12:10.353
Hello?

12:10.521 --> 12:13.398
Oh, my God. I totally forgot.

12:13.566 --> 12:15.984
Well, can't someone else do it?

12:16.152 --> 12:18.445
But I have company.

12:21.323 --> 12:24.492
Yeah, no, look, that's all right.
I'll come in. Okay.

12:25.161 --> 12:27.662
Um, I'm really sorry,
but I have to go into work.

12:27.830 --> 12:31.458
It's one of my regulars.
He's insisting that I do him, so...

12:31.625 --> 12:34.002
- Hey, what kind of work do you do?
- Oh.

12:34.503 --> 12:37.881
I'm a masseuse.
I give people massages and stuff.

12:38.048 --> 12:41.968
You work at one of
those massage parlors?

12:43.012 --> 12:46.347
Well, you know, we don't call it that.
But, yeah.

12:49.560 --> 12:51.686
Whoa, that's wild.

12:51.854 --> 12:53.855
No, I had no idea. Ha-ha-ha.

12:54.023 --> 12:55.857
Alrighty. Heh.

12:56.859 --> 13:00.612
I'll be back in a little bit.
Unless you wanna come with me.

13:00.780 --> 13:02.697
You mean, like, watch?

13:03.699 --> 13:07.327
No. No, you can get one yourself.
It'll be on the house.

13:07.495 --> 13:10.038
You know, what are big sisters for?
Ha, ha.

13:10.539 --> 13:13.541
Well, I don't think this. You know?

13:13.709 --> 13:15.835
No, no, no. I wouldn't do you myself.

13:16.003 --> 13:17.837
I mean, that would be weird.

13:19.256 --> 13:21.174
Yeah. I'll get one of the other girls
to do it.

13:21.342 --> 13:25.178
Ooh, this is so much fun. Yay! Ha, ha.

13:25.346 --> 13:27.430
- Are you excited?
- Yeah.

13:29.266 --> 13:32.227
Hey, do Monica and Rachel work there?

13:34.438 --> 13:36.356
It's beautiful.

13:36.524 --> 13:40.235
It's like the first bathroom floor
there ever was.

13:40.402 --> 13:41.736
Whoa.

13:41.904 --> 13:44.239
What are you going in there for?

13:44.406 --> 13:46.407
You want, like, a number?

13:49.912 --> 13:52.539
- Hey.
- Hi. Bye.

13:53.791 --> 13:56.459
Okay. I'm done with my choices.

13:56.627 --> 13:58.920
These are final.

14:00.089 --> 14:03.007
- Well, it's about time.
- Yeah. Very official.

14:03.175 --> 14:07.554
Oh, yeah. Well, you know,
Chandler printed it up on his computer.

14:07.721 --> 14:09.097
And who laminated it?

14:11.100 --> 14:13.184
That was me.

14:13.352 --> 14:15.436
All right, let me see. Ahem.

14:15.604 --> 14:19.482
"Uma Thurman, Winona Ryder,
Elizabeth Hurley...

14:19.650 --> 14:21.025
...Michelle Pfeiffer...

14:22.111 --> 14:23.903
...Dorothy Hamill"?

14:29.535 --> 14:31.703
Hey, it's my list.

14:32.204 --> 14:34.831
Okay, honey, you do realize
she only spins like that on ice?

14:39.461 --> 14:42.005
Ow, ow, ow.

14:42.172 --> 14:44.966
- Oh. What? Whoa.
- Ow, you know? Ow.

14:45.134 --> 14:47.635
- Hey, hey, what's going on?
- She broke my arm.

14:47.803 --> 14:50.471
- He touched my fanny.
- No, she touched mine first.

14:50.639 --> 14:52.223
That's my job.

14:52.391 --> 14:53.683
So wait, what's the deal?

14:53.851 --> 14:56.060
I can have sex with you
but I can't touch you?

14:56.228 --> 14:57.687
Ew.

14:57.855 --> 15:01.232
- You can't have sex with her.
- Did you think I was a hooker?

15:01.400 --> 15:04.903
No, okay. I know. You're a masseuse.
It's cool. I'm not a cop.

15:07.114 --> 15:08.197
Okay.

15:08.365 --> 15:11.326
Can you ask Mr. Wiffler
if he can wait for, like, five minutes?

15:11.493 --> 15:12.994
Fine.

15:13.162 --> 15:15.288
I don't like you.

15:16.582 --> 15:20.460
So that's what you thought I did? God.

15:20.628 --> 15:22.670
That's not what I do.

15:23.047 --> 15:26.090
Wait, that...
Wait, that's not what you do?

15:26.258 --> 15:28.176
No.

15:28.344 --> 15:30.011
Why would you think that?

15:30.179 --> 15:33.556
I don't know. I mean, you know...
This is the city, you know? I just...

15:33.724 --> 15:35.058
I mean, uh...

15:35.225 --> 15:36.684
...I don't know.

15:38.187 --> 15:42.106
Whatever. It's the perfect end
to the perfect weekend anyway.

15:43.484 --> 15:44.734
Oh, wait.

15:44.902 --> 15:48.196
No, you're right. No, it was perfect.

15:48.697 --> 15:51.240
I can't believe
that I screwed it up so bad.

15:53.077 --> 15:54.702
You really thought it was perfect?

15:54.870 --> 15:57.080
Well, no, maybe it wasn't perfect...

15:57.247 --> 15:59.874
...but, you know, it was pretty cool,
you know?

16:00.042 --> 16:02.627
Because we had all those great talks,
you know?

16:06.340 --> 16:07.382
Yeah. Um...

16:07.549 --> 16:10.259
Which ones in particular
were great for you?

16:11.220 --> 16:13.930
Well, you know,
about the tongue thing, you know?

16:14.098 --> 16:17.767
And how I told you about my likes
and my dislikes.

16:17.935 --> 16:19.227
I don't...

16:19.395 --> 16:23.189
How I like to melt stuff
and how I dislike stuff that doesn't melt.

16:25.526 --> 16:27.735
Right. Okay. Mm-hm.

16:27.903 --> 16:30.321
You know,
I feel like I can really talk to you...

16:30.489 --> 16:33.074
...because, you know,
you're my sister, you know?

16:35.577 --> 16:38.246
Yeah. I guess I do. Yeah.

16:38.414 --> 16:41.165
And then I go feel your friend up
and make you mad at me.

16:43.544 --> 16:46.838
Yeah, well, I wasn't hopping mad,
you know?

16:47.548 --> 16:49.716
You hopped a little bit.

16:51.635 --> 16:54.929
Yeah, I'm really sorry.
You know, I'm really...

16:56.015 --> 16:57.056
Okay.

16:59.435 --> 17:03.104
Well, this is my favorite part
of the weekend. Right now. This.

17:03.272 --> 17:05.106
- This?
- Uh-huh.

17:05.273 --> 17:07.650
Oh, come on. We went to Times Square.

17:07.818 --> 17:11.069
We found ninja stars.
I almost get my arm broken by a hooker...

17:11.238 --> 17:12.655
She's not a hooker.

17:13.281 --> 17:16.451
Well, when I tell my friends about her,
she will be.

17:22.124 --> 17:24.000
Okay. On three.

17:24.167 --> 17:25.960
One, two...

17:26.127 --> 17:27.795
Why don't we just go on two?

17:27.963 --> 17:30.631
- Why two?
- Because it's faster.

17:30.799 --> 17:34.135
Yeah, I could've counted to three four times
without all this two talk.

17:34.303 --> 17:38.139
- All right, but in the future...
- Okay. Heavy thing not getting lighter.

17:38.307 --> 17:39.807
Okay.

17:39.975 --> 17:41.517
One, two...

17:41.685 --> 17:43.144
- So we are going with two?
- All right.

17:52.988 --> 17:54.572
Oh, good job, Joe.

17:55.866 --> 17:57.408
Wow.

17:57.576 --> 17:58.618
It's big.

17:59.661 --> 18:03.372
Yeah. Yeah, so big that it actually
makes our doors look smaller.

18:04.333 --> 18:05.666
Maybe my ruler's wrong.

18:05.834 --> 18:08.377
Maybe all the rulers are wrong.

18:09.046 --> 18:10.505
Look, it's not that bad.

18:10.672 --> 18:13.633
So what? It blocks a little of your door,
a little of my door.

18:13.801 --> 18:14.842
I got a better idea.

18:15.010 --> 18:18.679
How about it blocks none of my door
and a lot of your door?

18:21.850 --> 18:25.728
Listen, before I forget,
that side is still wet.

18:29.691 --> 18:31.859
Okay, ahem,
let me just see if I've got this right.

18:32.027 --> 18:35.488
So this is a half-caf, double-tall,
easy-hazelnut...

18:35.656 --> 18:40.701
...nonfat, no foam, with whip,
extra-hot latte, right?

18:40.869 --> 18:42.370
Okay, great.

18:42.538 --> 18:44.956
Ahem. You freak.

18:50.712 --> 18:54.173
- Thank you. Ahem.
- A coffee to go, please.

18:54.883 --> 18:57.718
Oh, my God. Guys.

18:57.886 --> 18:59.387
Isabella Rossellini.

18:59.555 --> 19:02.140
Are you serious? Oh, my God.

19:02.307 --> 19:05.893
Damn. I cannot believe
I took her off my list.

19:06.061 --> 19:08.271
Why? Because otherwise you'd go for it?

19:10.983 --> 19:12.108
Yeah, maybe.

19:12.276 --> 19:15.069
Oh, heh. You lie.

19:15.237 --> 19:17.280
You don't think I'd go up to her?

19:17.447 --> 19:21.242
Ross, it took you 10 years
to finally admit you liked me.

19:23.245 --> 19:28.749
Yeah? Well, missy, you better be glad
that list is laminated. Heh.

19:28.917 --> 19:33.254
You know what, honey? You go ahead.
We'll call her an alternate.

19:34.131 --> 19:38.009
- Okay. Hold my cruller.
- Okay.

19:38.844 --> 19:40.887
Rach, are you really gonna let him
do this?

19:41.054 --> 19:43.431
Honey, he's about to go hit
on Isabella Rossellini.

19:43.599 --> 19:46.309
I'm just sorry we don't got popcorn.

19:49.396 --> 19:51.439
Hi. Hi.

19:51.607 --> 19:53.107
I'm Ross.

19:53.275 --> 19:56.944
Um, you don't know me,
but I'm a big, big fan of yours.

19:57.112 --> 20:00.114
I mean, um, Blue Velvet. Whoo.

20:03.785 --> 20:07.121
I was wondering if I could maybe
buy you a, um, cup of coffee.

20:07.289 --> 20:09.790
Or reimburse you for that one.

20:11.793 --> 20:14.086
Aren't you with that girl over there?

20:18.759 --> 20:20.259
Well, yeah, kind of.

20:20.427 --> 20:23.179
But that's okay.
See, we have an understanding.

20:23.347 --> 20:26.766
See, we each have this list
of five famous people...

20:26.934 --> 20:28.351
...and you were one of mine.

20:28.518 --> 20:30.811
So I'm allowed to sleep with you.

20:31.396 --> 20:34.148
No, no, no. It's flattering.

20:34.858 --> 20:36.484
Whoa. Heh, heh.

20:36.652 --> 20:40.821
- I don't know...
- No, no, no. Wait. Wait, Isabella.

20:40.989 --> 20:42.865
Don't just dismiss this so fast.

20:43.033 --> 20:45.451
I mean,
this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

20:45.619 --> 20:46.661
Yeah, for you.

20:49.081 --> 20:50.248
Is that the list?

20:50.415 --> 20:51.999
- Um, yes.
- Can I see it?

20:52.167 --> 20:53.292
- Um, no.
- Come on.

20:53.460 --> 20:55.086
But... Okay.

20:55.837 --> 20:57.171
I'm not on the list.

20:57.339 --> 20:59.840
Um, see, but that's not the final draft.

21:00.342 --> 21:02.301
It's laminated.

21:03.262 --> 21:04.303
Yeah.

21:04.471 --> 21:07.348
Um, okay, see, you were on my list.

21:07.516 --> 21:09.433
But then my friend Chandler...

21:12.354 --> 21:15.439
...brought up the very good point
that you are international.

21:15.607 --> 21:19.277
So I bumped you for Winona Ryder.
Local.

21:19.444 --> 21:22.905
You know, it's ironic,
because I have a list...

21:23.073 --> 21:26.075
...of five goofy coffeehouse guys...
Uh-huh.

21:26.243 --> 21:30.371
...and yesterday, I just bumped you
for that guy over there.

21:30.539 --> 21:31.998
That?

21:38.380 --> 21:39.964
We're just gonna be friends.

21:45.387 --> 21:47.680
- You know what?
- Hmm?

21:47.848 --> 21:49.348
Betcha I could fit in there.

21:51.935 --> 21:54.562
I got 5 bucks says you can't.

21:55.731 --> 21:58.024
Get out your checkbook, mister.

21:58.692 --> 22:01.319
Oh, I think I have the cash.

22:06.575 --> 22:08.659
You are dog, man.

22:09.369 --> 22:11.495
I totally fit.

22:11.663 --> 22:13.831
Yeah. You got me.

22:13.999 --> 22:17.043
I'm out five big ones.

22:19.921 --> 22:21.172
There you go.

22:21.882 --> 22:23.257
Thank you.

22:23.425 --> 22:25.092
Cha-ching.

22:27.137 --> 22:30.014
Oh, well, hello, Mr. Lincoln.

22:30.599 --> 22:33.142
Better luck next time, buddy.

22:33.310 --> 22:36.687
And the drinks are on me.
