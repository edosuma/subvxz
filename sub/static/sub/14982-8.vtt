11:23.259 --> 11:25.644
Rudy, still unemployed.

11:25.712 --> 11:27.946
I heard you guys
don't speak anymore, huh?

11:29.215 --> 11:31.183
Right.

11:38.258 --> 11:40.459
Kira's dead.

11:41.961 --> 11:45.063
And by the way,
you're an Uncle now.

11:45.114 --> 11:47.966
Oh, really?

11:49.636 --> 11:51.119
What was that?

11:52.539 --> 11:53.805
Nothin'.

11:53.873 --> 11:55.157
No, no, no,
you said something.

11:55.241 --> 11:57.209
What'd you say?
I heard you.

11:58.444 --> 12:02.414
Fine. You want to be
like that, be like that.

12:03.583 --> 12:06.457
I'm telling you,
you don't question suspects

12:06.525 --> 12:09.527
for the same crime in the same room.
It's interrogation 101.

12:09.595 --> 12:12.230
Along with
rubber hoses 101.

12:16.702 --> 12:18.035
What's the matter with you?

12:18.103 --> 12:19.971
Really?
Nothing.

12:20.038 --> 12:21.839
Where's my camera?

12:21.907 --> 12:24.642
I left it in my car.

12:24.710 --> 12:26.110
Why so angry, then?

12:26.178 --> 12:28.412
What are you talking about?
I'm not angry.

12:28.480 --> 12:31.282
My camera's not in the car.

12:31.350 --> 12:34.001
Loker told you.

12:34.086 --> 12:36.787
Did something happen to you
when you was out on the street?

12:36.855 --> 12:38.823
I'll get you
another camera.

12:38.891 --> 12:41.292
You do that.

12:41.360 --> 12:42.960
In the meantime, here.

12:43.011 --> 12:45.530
I want you
to take Foster out.

12:45.597 --> 12:48.399
Have some lunch, you know.
You both deserve it.

12:48.467 --> 12:50.735
Oh.

12:50.802 --> 12:52.069
Right.

12:52.137 --> 12:54.172
You can go now.

12:54.239 --> 12:56.207
[Door opens]

12:57.442 --> 12:58.876
What?

12:59.711 --> 13:01.412
Nothing.

13:03.749 --> 13:04.682
Ready?

13:04.733 --> 13:05.850
Ready.

13:05.918 --> 13:07.518
Good.

13:09.721 --> 13:13.191
Looks like
2 rattlesnakes in a bag.

13:13.258 --> 13:14.825
Time for the scorpion.

13:17.763 --> 13:19.830
I'm sorry. Am I
interrupting something?

13:19.898 --> 13:21.666
Do you want me
to come back later?

13:21.733 --> 13:24.535
You know, when you finish
catching up.

13:24.603 --> 13:25.503
I already told
your cop friend,

13:25.554 --> 13:27.672
I haven't seen Kira
in 4 years.

13:27.739 --> 13:29.590
Me, too.

13:29.675 --> 13:31.475
Do you want to know
what he said about you?

13:31.543 --> 13:33.144
What does this have to do
with my sister's murder?

13:33.212 --> 13:34.979
I'm sorry, what did you say?

13:38.617 --> 13:39.884
That's shame from Rudy.

13:39.952 --> 13:41.385
Over Kira?

13:41.453 --> 13:42.920
He was looking at Marcus.

13:42.988 --> 13:43.854
Whatever he told you
is a lie.

13:43.922 --> 13:45.590
I didn't say anything,
all right?

13:45.657 --> 13:48.726
It was dad. Dad thinks
we killed Kira.

13:48.794 --> 13:49.727
We?

13:49.795 --> 13:52.797
How is your old man,
anyway?

13:52.864 --> 13:54.465
[Shouting]
I said, how is your old man?!

13:54.533 --> 13:56.534
Hey! Why do you
keep doing that?

13:56.602 --> 13:59.086
'Cause you can't hear me
properly, can you?

13:59.171 --> 14:01.289
Just like you couldn't
hear him earlier.

14:01.373 --> 14:02.540
Oh, really?

14:04.243 --> 14:05.943
So, what, you're deaf
in one ear, are you?

14:07.045 --> 14:08.346
How'd that happen?

14:08.413 --> 14:09.981
It wasn't me.

14:10.048 --> 14:10.982
Yeah, right.

14:11.049 --> 14:12.350
All right, well,
let me guess.

14:12.417 --> 14:14.252
Uh...Baseball bat?

14:14.319 --> 14:15.853
Tire iron?

14:15.921 --> 14:17.955
'Cause neither one of you strike me
the kind of bare-knuckle wankers

14:18.023 --> 14:18.842
I grew up with.

14:18.942 --> 14:20.098
Try whiskey bottle.

14:20.198 --> 14:22.414
Yeah. Hit me with
the damn thing right here.

14:23.128 --> 14:24.061
Oh.

14:24.129 --> 14:25.329
It was bourbon.

14:25.397 --> 14:26.831
That's true, right?

14:26.898 --> 14:28.499
Lightman just got us
a baseline.

14:28.567 --> 14:30.801
I'll bet you had it coming,
didn't you?

14:30.869 --> 14:33.704
I wasn't the one who stole stole the
night deposit and got us cut off.

14:33.772 --> 14:36.474
Son of a bitch.
You gonna put this all on me, Marcus?

14:36.541 --> 14:38.042
Why don't you tell him
whose idea it was, huh?

14:38.109 --> 14:40.711
Night deposit.
All of it.

14:40.779 --> 14:43.547
Who put the mirror in front of
me, huh, gave me my first bump?

14:43.615 --> 14:44.615
Who was that?

14:44.683 --> 14:45.983
Hey, if you could
do this to me,

14:46.051 --> 14:48.286
how do I know
you didn't kill Kira?

14:48.353 --> 14:51.322
[Shouting]

14:52.391 --> 14:55.142
Aah!

14:55.227 --> 14:57.094
You better control...
[Indistinct]

14:57.162 --> 14:59.697
[Shouting]

14:59.765 --> 15:02.066
I told you we should
have split them up.

15:02.134 --> 15:04.869
You better tell 'em
the truth.

15:04.936 --> 15:08.439
You better get him
out of here!

15:10.575 --> 15:12.526
You happy?!

15:17.949 --> 15:22.186
So, 4 years since
you've seen Kira, right?

15:22.254 --> 15:24.622
Do me a favor.

15:24.690 --> 15:26.457
I mean, your pain's
too raw, right?

15:26.525 --> 15:27.992
You're an open wound.
Look at you.

15:28.060 --> 15:30.695
So, when did you
last see her?

15:30.762 --> 15:32.363
A month ago?

15:32.431 --> 15:34.732
A week ago?

15:37.102 --> 15:38.803
The night of the murder?

15:43.141 --> 15:45.409
Right.

15:46.695 --> 15:47.695
Right.

15:47.779 --> 15:51.482
I just found out
that Marcus saw Kira

15:51.550 --> 15:53.150
not long before
she was killed.

15:53.218 --> 15:56.153
So much for
interrogation 101, eh?

15:56.221 --> 15:58.055
Yeah, well, while you were
starting your cage fight in there,

15:58.123 --> 15:59.590
my cop friends
made an arrest.

15:59.658 --> 16:01.225
Pissed-off hooker
says her meth head boyfriend

16:01.293 --> 16:03.027
and his pal did the murder.

16:03.095 --> 16:03.928
Oh, good.

16:03.995 --> 16:05.863
'Cause hookers
never lie.

16:05.931 --> 16:07.231
Neither do ballistics.

16:07.299 --> 16:10.801
She gave us the gun,
a match for the bullet in Kira's head.

16:10.869 --> 16:14.939
We got our killers,
and it ain't him or his brother.

16:19.783 --> 16:21.990
Why can't you admit
you were wrong about Jim's sons?

16:22.090 --> 16:23.924
'Cause Marcus lied.
And guns change hands.

16:23.992 --> 16:25.426
You get the fat one.

16:25.494 --> 16:26.894
You mark my words--
sooner or later

16:26.962 --> 16:29.730
you're gonna find out
this is all about that messed-up family.

16:29.798 --> 16:31.365
Yeah, so who are these two,
Jim's nephews?

16:31.433 --> 16:33.517
You only want answers that
Jim will like, don't you?

16:33.602 --> 16:36.137
So what's he got on you, eh?

16:36.204 --> 16:37.905
'Cause that's why
you don't want me near him.

16:37.973 --> 16:40.941
I guess this time we're gonna
keep them separate, huh?

16:41.009 --> 16:42.176
Oh, yeah, right.
Good idea.

16:42.244 --> 16:44.612
[Door slams]

16:47.049 --> 16:49.683
So, where'd you get
that gun?

16:49.751 --> 16:51.852
We found that gun
in a trash can.

16:51.920 --> 16:55.122
Yeah, my grandma
was a virgin.

16:55.190 --> 16:57.258
We didn't kill nobody,
I swear.

16:59.761 --> 17:02.063
You believe in
the Easter bunny?

17:02.130 --> 17:04.698
What the hell
kind of question's that?

17:04.766 --> 17:08.069
The trash can.
Why were you digging in the trash can?

17:08.136 --> 17:10.337
I like leftovers.

17:10.405 --> 17:12.039
How about Santa?
You believe in Santa?

17:12.107 --> 17:14.575
Not since I was, like, 8.

17:14.643 --> 17:17.811
So you don't believe
everything that you're told.

17:17.878 --> 17:21.048
What the hell
are you talking about, man?

17:21.116 --> 17:22.316
You killed that girl.

17:22.384 --> 17:25.519
You know it
and I know it, fat man.

17:25.569 --> 17:27.088
Get me a lawyer.

17:27.155 --> 17:28.422
Tell me you didn't
kill that girl.

17:28.490 --> 17:29.957
We didn't kill anybody.

17:30.025 --> 17:31.659
I swear.

17:31.726 --> 17:33.094
You believe that.

17:33.962 --> 17:36.097
Moron.

17:38.967 --> 17:42.570
All right.
Now tell him the truth.

17:42.637 --> 17:45.139
You killed that girl,
right?

17:45.207 --> 17:48.209
Now...

17:48.276 --> 17:50.444
Did you see...

17:50.512 --> 17:51.912
How his lip

17:51.980 --> 17:52.980
just kind of twitched
like that?

17:53.048 --> 17:54.215
You see that?

17:55.517 --> 17:56.784
He can't help that.

17:56.852 --> 17:58.752
You can't bite back

17:58.820 --> 18:01.188
anger like that.

18:04.259 --> 18:05.726
You know I'm right.

18:05.794 --> 18:07.394
I want that lawyer.

18:08.296 --> 18:10.731
So what happened?
Did you...

18:10.799 --> 18:12.233
Freak out
and hit the crystal?

18:12.300 --> 18:13.400
Shut up, Eddie.

18:13.468 --> 18:15.769
He never said nothing,
numnuts.

18:16.705 --> 18:18.539
We didn't do nothin', man.

18:18.607 --> 18:20.875
Oh, you robbed that
restaurant all right.

18:20.942 --> 18:22.243
You confessed
to that on sight.

18:22.310 --> 18:23.844
But he lied to you
about the rest of it.

18:23.912 --> 18:26.580
And you believed him, 'cause you
wanted to believe him, right?

18:26.648 --> 18:28.649
Because it was easier
than the truth.

18:28.717 --> 18:29.650
He missed.

18:29.718 --> 18:31.152
You said you missed.

18:31.219 --> 18:32.553
Hey!
You son of a bitch!

18:32.621 --> 18:33.821
He didn't miss.

18:33.889 --> 18:36.423
You know he didn't miss.
He didn't miss.

18:36.491 --> 18:37.658
I mean, you saw
what that bullet

18:37.726 --> 18:39.026
did to that girl's
head, right?

18:39.094 --> 18:40.761
Not true. You're lying.

18:40.829 --> 18:42.730
All right.
Take a seat.

18:49.204 --> 18:51.872
Now, look at them,
you punk.

19:05.320 --> 19:07.922
We--we--we just--

19:07.989 --> 19:09.924
we needed money.

19:09.991 --> 19:11.992
There was 1,500 bucks
and change in that till.

19:12.060 --> 19:14.895
Is that all that girl's
life was worth to you?

19:14.963 --> 19:17.031
Is it?

19:19.701 --> 19:21.852
Eh?

19:24.472 --> 19:26.373
Oh, there was more.

19:29.311 --> 19:30.644
Yeah.

19:30.712 --> 19:33.647
So, you were paid
to do it, were you?

19:36.084 --> 19:38.919
We were down in Anacostia
looking to score.

19:38.987 --> 19:42.856
Dude walked up, told Nick
he'd pay us 5 grand.

19:42.924 --> 19:44.158
This the guy?

19:51.866 --> 19:53.300
It was night
and he had a hat on,

19:53.368 --> 19:56.370
and I was pretty lit.

19:57.772 --> 20:00.107
Oh, yeah.

20:05.547 --> 20:08.215
If you ask me one more question
before I get a lawyer,

20:08.283 --> 20:10.451
the fat one walks.

20:11.486 --> 20:13.721
Go ahead.

20:18.526 --> 20:19.960
Oh, yeah?

20:20.028 --> 20:21.862
Don't clock out just yet,
all right?

20:21.930 --> 20:23.297
I wasn't going anywhere.

20:23.365 --> 20:25.566
I was waiting for you.
And Wallowski.

20:25.634 --> 20:28.002
Don't think that lunch
with Torres fooled me.

20:28.069 --> 20:29.637
Where'd you go, then?

20:29.704 --> 20:31.372
Somewhere swanky?

20:31.439 --> 20:34.241
Why do you feel it's necessary
to hide her from me?

20:34.309 --> 20:36.910
How do you know that I'm
not hiding you from her?

20:36.978 --> 20:38.412
I'm so glad
I waited for you.

20:38.480 --> 20:39.897
You don't like her,
do you?

20:39.981 --> 20:42.349
I don't know her,
thanks to you.

20:42.417 --> 20:44.718
Well, look, I had to lie
for her to you

20:44.769 --> 20:46.253
when she was being
investigated.

20:46.321 --> 20:47.821
I don't want to
have to do that again.

20:47.889 --> 20:49.907
You keep trying
to protect me. How sweet.

20:49.991 --> 20:52.793
Oh, so, you're ok
with her, then.

20:52.861 --> 20:55.229
I didn't say that.

20:55.297 --> 20:56.297
Yet.

20:56.364 --> 20:58.265
You know, she's good.

20:58.333 --> 20:59.600
I mean, you know,

20:59.668 --> 21:01.335
she's very good.

21:01.403 --> 21:02.736
At what she does.

21:02.804 --> 21:04.738
I wouldn't know.

21:14.182 --> 21:16.283
Right.

21:16.351 --> 21:18.886
Dinner's on me.
It's a threesome.

21:18.953 --> 21:21.255
You'll have to use another card.
This one was denied.

21:21.323 --> 21:23.023
Oh, yeah?
What you been up to?

21:23.091 --> 21:24.792
Here's the other half.

21:24.859 --> 21:26.493
Nice shoes.

21:34.035 --> 21:36.837
Aunt Abby called, said dad
wanted me to come by.

21:36.905 --> 21:39.807
Aunt Abby's a liar.

21:39.874 --> 21:42.676
Well, I should know.
I put her up to it.

21:42.744 --> 21:44.311
This is harassment.

21:44.379 --> 21:45.846
No, look, no.

21:45.914 --> 21:47.047
You stay, all right?

21:47.115 --> 21:48.132
And we'll leave.

21:48.216 --> 21:49.750
I mean, after all,
it is your place.

21:49.818 --> 21:50.951
Or it will be,

21:51.002 --> 21:53.587
you know, when your dad
kicks the bucket.

21:53.655 --> 21:56.156
I mean, with Kira gone, you
and Rudy get the business.

21:56.224 --> 21:58.092
Jim may have left you
out of his life,

21:58.159 --> 21:59.893
but he didn't
cut you out of his will.

21:59.961 --> 22:01.295
He didn't have
the heart for that.

22:01.363 --> 22:03.130
And don't act like
you don't know.

22:03.198 --> 22:05.132
Actually, I think
his surprise is genuine.

22:05.200 --> 22:06.467
Yeah.
Oh, yeah?

22:06.534 --> 22:09.002
Do you want to see
where your sister got shot?

22:09.070 --> 22:11.038
Why are you doing this?

22:11.106 --> 22:12.673
'Cause someone hired
those killers.

22:12.741 --> 22:14.975
And we're standing right in
the middle of your motive.

22:15.043 --> 22:16.677
Right, so,

22:16.745 --> 22:21.115
the bullet enters here.

22:21.182 --> 22:24.485
All right, all right,
that is enough.

22:24.552 --> 22:27.054
I'm sorry.
I'm Gillian Foster.

22:27.122 --> 22:30.224
I'm his partner,
and I have to put up with him.

22:30.291 --> 22:32.159
I'm sorry about that.

22:32.227 --> 22:34.261
I--I know you miss her.

22:34.329 --> 22:36.163
What do you care?

22:40.034 --> 22:42.102
I lost my brother

22:42.170 --> 22:43.871
in a car accident.

22:43.938 --> 22:46.206
There's still days
I want to call him.

22:46.274 --> 22:48.742
And I even dial, and...

22:48.810 --> 22:51.545
Then I remember.

22:51.613 --> 22:53.547
No, I know
what it's like.

22:54.816 --> 22:56.950
You're alone.

22:57.018 --> 22:58.018
Your...

22:58.086 --> 23:00.854
Your father's
slipping away.

23:00.922 --> 23:02.623
Your brother's
dead to you,

23:02.690 --> 23:04.191
and now Kira.

23:04.259 --> 23:08.462
What happened the last
time you saw Kira?

23:12.333 --> 23:13.867
She came to me.

23:13.935 --> 23:16.069
She missed me.

23:16.137 --> 23:17.371
Wanted to patch things up.

23:17.439 --> 23:19.106
She wanted you to make
peace with your dad

23:19.174 --> 23:20.574
before he died.

23:20.642 --> 23:22.843
You and Rudy.

23:22.911 --> 23:25.746
Hey! How come you didn't say anything
about this last night?

23:25.814 --> 23:27.781
With our family history,

23:27.849 --> 23:31.218
who'd believe Kira and I
didn't have a fight?

23:31.286 --> 23:34.087
Well, that's half true.

23:34.155 --> 23:36.757
What about the rest, eh?

23:36.825 --> 23:38.826
What about
the half that matters?

23:41.196 --> 23:43.864
I didn't want to say
in front of Rudy.

23:43.932 --> 23:45.866
You told her not
to bother with him.

23:45.934 --> 23:49.002
I told Kira
Rudy was a lost cause.

23:51.072 --> 23:53.073
You getting all this,
Rudy?

23:53.141 --> 23:56.910
We invited your baby
brother down here.

23:56.978 --> 24:00.514
Well, rude not to,
really.

24:07.555 --> 24:10.457
He's innocent, too,
by the way.

24:10.525 --> 24:12.960
They caught
the killers, so...

24:13.027 --> 24:15.829
Well, go on, then.
Man up.

24:22.437 --> 24:25.272
So I'm an Uncle now, hey?

24:27.609 --> 24:29.510
They're more interested
in making up

24:29.577 --> 24:31.778
than finding out
who the real killers are.

24:31.846 --> 24:33.947
You know, you scare me
sometimes, you do,

24:34.015 --> 24:36.283
how good a liar
you can be.

24:36.351 --> 24:37.951
I always wanted
a brother.

24:38.002 --> 24:39.486
Dr. Lightman.

24:40.955 --> 24:43.457
I wrapped this up
for you.

24:44.492 --> 24:49.029
Just let Jim know
that it wasn't them.

24:49.097 --> 24:52.533
I wasn't sure.
That's why I didn't want to say.

24:52.600 --> 24:55.636
My cardiologist thanks you.

24:55.703 --> 24:57.804
Hey, by the way,

24:57.872 --> 25:00.541
Detective Wallowski was wondering
if you could look at a lineup.

25:00.608 --> 25:02.659
It's a cop thing.

25:02.744 --> 25:04.745
Sure. Anything I can do.

25:04.812 --> 25:07.180
Just let me know when.

25:07.248 --> 25:08.665
How about now?

25:08.750 --> 25:10.500
Don't rush. Just take
a good long look

25:10.585 --> 25:12.753
and tell us who you saw.

25:21.996 --> 25:25.299
They--they had masks.

25:26.434 --> 25:28.702
I--I can't say.

25:29.871 --> 25:31.638
That's all right, mate.

25:31.706 --> 25:35.008
Always better to be
truthful, don't you think?

25:35.076 --> 25:36.009
Here.

25:36.077 --> 25:38.612
What--what are you--

25:41.516 --> 25:43.450
is this him?

25:51.593 --> 25:53.393
I think we've seen that look
somewhere before,

25:53.461 --> 25:54.561
don't you, Professor?

25:54.629 --> 25:57.297
Recognition.

25:57.365 --> 26:01.101
This junkie recognizes you
from somewhere, Teddy.

26:12.329 --> 26:13.729
So, you recognize the killers

26:13.797 --> 26:15.788
'cause you hired them,
right?

26:16.369 --> 26:17.235
This is crazy.

26:17.303 --> 26:18.903
I--I'm a witness.

26:18.955 --> 26:21.206
No, you paid them
to kill Kira,

26:21.274 --> 26:23.008
and then you tried
to pin it on Marcus and Rudy.

26:23.076 --> 26:26.278
I never said their names.

26:27.413 --> 26:31.850
So, this is from
before the shooting.

26:31.918 --> 26:33.218
This is at the restaurant,
you and Kira arguing

26:33.286 --> 26:35.120
over the sauce, right?
See that?

26:35.188 --> 26:39.591
Sadness. You were grieving before they
even walked through the door, mate.

26:39.659 --> 26:42.227
We were talking about
Jim's dying.

26:42.295 --> 26:43.895
I loved Kira.

26:43.963 --> 26:46.298
I didn't do this.

26:46.366 --> 26:47.933
Please.

26:51.270 --> 26:52.938
Hold that thought.

26:55.041 --> 26:57.909
I can't hold an old man based
on nothing but your science.

26:57.977 --> 27:00.479
I don't expect
you to, darling.

27:00.546 --> 27:03.048
So, what, you think you're
gonna get a confession now?

27:03.116 --> 27:05.951
Did you ever try
to hire a hit man?

27:06.019 --> 27:08.754
Not exactly a buyer's
market out there.

27:08.821 --> 27:10.222
So you're taking
a meth head's word for it,

27:10.289 --> 27:11.256
because meth heads,
they never lie.

27:11.324 --> 27:13.458
Bring 'em in again
if you don't believe me.

27:13.526 --> 27:15.627
After your stunt in the lineup,
they both lawyered up.

27:15.695 --> 27:17.729
We won't see their faces
till trial.

27:17.797 --> 27:19.531
And Jim will be dead
by then.

27:29.609 --> 27:31.309
You think this is funny,
do you?

27:31.377 --> 27:33.478
Do you see me laughing?

27:33.546 --> 27:35.080
[Door closes]
Your ass off.

27:35.148 --> 27:37.649
You certainly don't treat her like
she's as good as you say she is.

27:37.717 --> 27:39.151
Oh, and that's funny
to you, is it?

27:39.218 --> 27:42.220
I know it shouldn't be,
but...I just can't resist.

27:42.288 --> 27:44.656
Got anything useful to say?

27:45.625 --> 27:47.793
Teddy's love for Kira
is real.

27:47.860 --> 27:49.828
And so's his love for Jim.

27:49.896 --> 27:52.998
You're accusing the man of murder, and
all he cares about is his best friend.

27:53.066 --> 27:56.601
There's a profile here,
and Teddy doesn't fit it.

27:56.669 --> 27:59.371
Not yet, he doesn't.

28:46.085 --> 28:48.420
Are you out of
your damn mind?

28:48.488 --> 28:50.789
I feel no pain,
if that's what you mean.

28:50.857 --> 28:55.961
Yesterday it's my sons.
Today it's my best friend.

28:56.028 --> 28:59.464
Yeah, well, your best friend
tried to pin it on your sons.

28:59.532 --> 29:02.300
Teddy wouldn't do that.

29:02.368 --> 29:03.969
We grew up together.

29:04.036 --> 29:05.737
We came here together.

29:05.805 --> 29:08.306
How's Marcus doing?

29:08.374 --> 29:11.510
I mean, gearing up
for his new job.

29:11.577 --> 29:12.978
Him and Rudy, they get
the business, right,

29:13.045 --> 29:14.246
after you're dead?

29:14.313 --> 29:17.215
Or did Teddy ask you
to put him in charge

29:17.283 --> 29:20.218
just until this mess with
the murders has blown over?

29:21.654 --> 29:25.056
You did as he asked,
didn't you?

29:25.124 --> 29:26.591
Get out of my house.

29:26.659 --> 29:29.928
Don't act like
you don't know...

29:29.996 --> 29:31.196
Deep down.

29:31.264 --> 29:33.498
You can't come
into my house

29:33.566 --> 29:38.503
and--and talk about my family
and my friends like that.

29:38.571 --> 29:40.605
[Monitor beeping faster]

29:40.673 --> 29:44.242
So, what's it gonna be,
then, Jim?

29:44.310 --> 29:47.646
You swallow the lies
and go quietly?

29:47.713 --> 29:50.282
Or do you die
with your eyes open?

29:53.886 --> 29:55.954
I'm here, Mr. Weaver.

30:32.091 --> 30:34.593
[Blues playing softly]

30:46.973 --> 30:49.441
I'm here to apologize.

30:49.508 --> 30:52.210
I can't find any evidence
you were involved in this.

30:52.278 --> 30:55.347
Dr. Lightman was wrong.
Scientists...

30:55.414 --> 30:56.681
You know.

30:56.749 --> 30:57.816
Does he know that?

30:57.884 --> 30:59.017
No, what's important

30:59.085 --> 31:01.419
is that you're not
a suspect anymore.

31:01.487 --> 31:03.588
[Cell phone rings]
Excuse me.

31:05.958 --> 31:07.525
Jim, how you doin'?

31:10.263 --> 31:13.031
[Monitor beeping]

31:18.771 --> 31:20.038
You did this to him.

31:20.106 --> 31:21.172
You upset him.

31:21.240 --> 31:22.540
Now, what lies
did you tell him?

31:22.608 --> 31:24.142
Not me, mate.

31:24.210 --> 31:26.945
It's Kira's death
that's killing him.

31:27.013 --> 31:29.231
You of all people
should know that.

31:29.315 --> 31:32.651
[Monitor beeping]

31:44.037 --> 31:46.205
[Dog barking]

31:48.141 --> 31:49.408
Now, what do you want?

31:49.476 --> 31:50.543
The camera.

31:50.610 --> 31:52.945
It wasn't mine,
and it wasn't your to take.

31:53.013 --> 31:55.381
So? I ain't got it.

31:55.449 --> 31:56.916
You sold it.

32:00.921 --> 32:02.555
You know, I grew up here.

32:02.622 --> 32:05.124
Grew. Past tense.

32:05.192 --> 32:07.626
That why you robbed me,
'cause I stuck out?

32:07.694 --> 32:09.628
No, you stuck out
'cause you got out.

32:09.696 --> 32:11.163
You ain't from
around here no more.

32:11.231 --> 32:14.100
Could you tell all that
just by looking at me?

32:15.802 --> 32:17.236
I do that, too.

32:17.304 --> 32:19.238
Pretty good at it.

32:19.306 --> 32:20.773
Normally.

32:21.975 --> 32:24.677
If I had this coat on,
would you have come at me?

32:26.947 --> 32:29.081
What you got
in those pockets?

32:32.185 --> 32:34.186
Exactly.

32:49.269 --> 32:52.405
You robbed those guys,
too, huh?

32:53.707 --> 32:55.408
How much longer
you think you can hide?

32:55.475 --> 32:56.776
As long as I have to.

32:56.843 --> 33:00.112
That's dumber than me
thinking a coat could keep me safe.

33:15.028 --> 33:17.430
[Monitor beeping]

33:22.002 --> 33:24.703
Well...He'll be ok.

33:24.771 --> 33:27.106
The machine's keeping
him alive for now.

33:27.174 --> 33:29.942
Jim was changing his will.

33:30.010 --> 33:32.812
His lawyer says he wanted
you to get everything.

33:32.879 --> 33:36.615
You have power of attorney.

33:42.856 --> 33:44.957
The doctors need to know

33:45.025 --> 33:48.027
if you want to keep him
this way or...

34:04.711 --> 34:09.248
Wallowski says
I was wrong about you.

34:09.315 --> 34:11.417
I was just doing
what I had to do.

34:11.485 --> 34:13.284
I hope you understand that.

34:14.321 --> 34:17.156
You think Kira's death
did this to him?

34:17.224 --> 34:18.757
Well, cancer
played its part.

34:18.824 --> 34:22.661
But, yeah, she was all
he had left.

34:24.364 --> 34:26.132
Jim wouldn't want
to live this way.

34:26.199 --> 34:27.733
That's the big question.

34:27.801 --> 34:30.436
That and picking out
a new car.

34:30.504 --> 34:33.172
I mean, personally,
I'd go for something sporty.

down the middle.

34:36.743 --> 34:37.943
What are you talking about?

34:38.011 --> 34:39.210

34:39.279 --> 34:42.748
Well, no, actually,
your money now, right?

34:42.815 --> 34:45.650
I--I can't talk
about that now.

34:45.719 --> 34:47.186
I know. It does your head in,
doesn't it?

34:47.254 --> 34:50.289
Especially since half of you
is so loyal,

34:50.357 --> 34:51.824
and the other half is jealous.

34:51.891 --> 34:53.826
Ok, you can leave now.

34:53.893 --> 34:55.427
No hard feelings.

34:55.495 --> 34:59.165
You don't hate Kira.

34:59.232 --> 35:00.166
Do you?

35:00.233 --> 35:02.168
Her death is killing you.

35:02.235 --> 35:07.539
Which is why I couldn't
spot your lies, first off.

35:07.591 --> 35:12.444
Until your anger at me
replaced your grief for her.

35:13.446 --> 35:16.148
Do you even have a heart,
Lightman?

if my best friend--

you've already decided, mate.

talking to Marcus and Rudy,

with the doctors.

No.

35:34.935 --> 35:37.469
I mean, just picking up
that pen...

35:37.537 --> 35:39.572
Was an act of betrayal.

35:43.476 --> 35:45.544
It's what Jim wanted.

35:45.612 --> 35:48.414
He always said
no heroics.

He told us to just
let him go.

throw my life away?

Which you are not.

36:20.947 --> 36:24.283
Jim, I didn't--

36:24.351 --> 36:25.884
even though you were with him
every step of the way.

36:25.952 --> 36:28.187
And then what's he gonna do?
He's just gonna hand it off

36:28.255 --> 36:29.288
to some little girl?

36:29.356 --> 36:31.156
I loved Kira.

36:31.224 --> 36:33.359
You took my child.

36:33.426 --> 36:36.695
You took my child.

36:36.763 --> 36:37.830
No.

36:37.897 --> 36:40.699
No, I...

36:40.767 --> 36:43.135
Jim, I...

36:47.474 --> 36:50.142
I loved her
as much as you did.

36:53.680 --> 36:57.049
Well, part of you did,
anyway.

37:02.522 --> 37:04.390
Let's go daddy..

37:23.611 --> 37:26.179
All better, then?

37:26.247 --> 37:27.650
I'll take that
as a "not really."

37:27.889 --> 37:30.390
To what do I owe
this pleasure?

37:30.458 --> 37:34.061
I just wanted to make sure
that Wallowski was telling it straight.

37:34.129 --> 37:35.963
I understand
Teddy's been charged.

37:36.030 --> 37:38.565
The D.A. says
it's a done deal.

37:38.633 --> 37:40.667
But you don't want to stick
around for the verdict?

37:40.735 --> 37:43.303
Thanks for the visit.

37:43.371 --> 37:44.905
So that's it?

37:44.973 --> 37:46.840
Cue the violins?

37:46.908 --> 37:50.544
I'm going out
with my eyes wide open.

37:50.612 --> 37:53.413
Half open, you mean.

37:54.883 --> 37:57.217
It's all your fault.

37:57.285 --> 37:58.452
All of it.

37:58.520 --> 38:01.355
You can't blame me
for what Teddy did.

38:01.422 --> 38:03.690
I'm not blaming you.
You are.

38:03.758 --> 38:06.193
Teddy may not be blood,

38:06.261 --> 38:08.695
but he is family.

38:08.763 --> 38:10.864
Just the same as Kira.

38:10.932 --> 38:12.966
But you treat him
like an employee.

38:13.034 --> 38:15.035
You can't ignore
your brother

38:15.103 --> 38:16.603
any more than
you fire your sons.

38:16.671 --> 38:18.138
Right?

38:20.408 --> 38:24.778
What's that, uh,
you've got Wallowski in?

38:24.846 --> 38:27.047
That goes with me
to my grave.

38:27.115 --> 38:29.917
You know I'll dig it up
sooner or later, don't you?

38:29.984 --> 38:34.087
A couple times
my boys got in trouble.

38:34.155 --> 38:36.023
She got the charges dropped.

38:36.090 --> 38:39.159
For what, free lunch?

38:40.628 --> 38:42.796
Oh, you must be joking.

38:42.864 --> 38:45.799
A free lunch.

38:45.867 --> 38:48.468
That's a girl
after my own heart.

38:53.741 --> 38:55.976
You, uh, sure about this?

38:56.044 --> 38:58.645
Not in the slightest,
mate.

39:28.276 --> 39:29.977
Can I help you?

39:31.346 --> 39:33.380
Yeah, I'm looking
for, uh...

39:33.448 --> 39:35.032
Ria Torres?

39:38.219 --> 39:40.020
Brows up and tense.

39:40.088 --> 39:42.055
Eyelids raised.

39:42.123 --> 39:43.390
Fear.

39:43.458 --> 39:44.825
Concealment.

39:44.892 --> 39:47.861
What do you guys do here?

40:00.008 --> 40:03.443
That's what we do here.

40:11.486 --> 40:13.086
Hey, you got it working.

40:13.154 --> 40:15.756
Yeah. It only took
3 different trips

40:15.823 --> 40:17.658
to 3 different shops.

40:17.725 --> 40:19.926
Why didn't you
just use the Internet?

40:21.496 --> 40:23.096
So, dad...

40:23.164 --> 40:24.665
Yeah.

40:24.732 --> 40:28.402
Is Shazzer short for Sharon
where you come from?

40:28.469 --> 40:29.936
Where I come from?

40:30.004 --> 40:31.838
What, you mean England?

40:31.906 --> 40:35.041
I thought we were Australian.

40:35.093 --> 40:38.478
Look, do you mind?
I'm trying to concentrate here.

40:38.546 --> 40:40.947
Well, I mean,
is she your new...

40:41.015 --> 40:42.349
You know.

40:42.417 --> 40:44.217
Look, leave it at that,
all right?

40:44.268 --> 40:46.486
I don't have a new,
you know.

40:46.554 --> 40:48.488
Meaning she is
your new you know.

40:48.556 --> 40:51.425
Meaning
nothing of the sort.

40:51.492 --> 40:53.560
I don't have
one of those...

40:53.628 --> 40:54.828
You knows.

40:54.896 --> 40:57.331
Don't you think you should
get a new girlfriend?

40:57.398 --> 41:00.901
Look, this is my new
girlfriend right now,

41:00.968 --> 41:02.569
you know,
thanks to you.

41:02.637 --> 41:05.238
At least until I can
bang this bloody book out.

41:05.306 --> 41:08.375
So...Do you mind?

41:08.443 --> 41:11.211
Computer: Next dealer up.

41:13.614 --> 41:15.849
Are you playing poker
on my account?

41:15.917 --> 41:18.485
It's 18 and over.

41:18.553 --> 41:20.587
Oh, look, you're ahead.
How'd you do that?

41:20.655 --> 41:23.090
Luck. And you should quit
while you're ahead.

41:23.157 --> 41:25.726
So, does Gillian approve
of Shazzer?

41:25.793 --> 41:27.260
With a passion.

41:27.328 --> 41:29.663
Yeah, totally.

41:30.832 --> 41:32.265
What?

41:32.333 --> 41:35.535
All right, well, maybe
not completely totally,

41:35.603 --> 41:37.437
but, you know,
she'll come around.

41:37.505 --> 41:38.872
You hope.

41:38.940 --> 41:40.407
Back to work.

41:41.793 --> 41:44.277
Hey.

41:58.292 --> 42:01.228
Little bugger.

42:01.295 --> 42:03.530
You got any wite-out?
