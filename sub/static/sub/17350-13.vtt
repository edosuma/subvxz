KAYO: You've always
treated me like family.

00:13.967 --> 00:16.700
And I hope what I am about to
tell you doesn't change that.

00:16.767 --> 00:19.767
Come on, Kayo, did you dunk
Thunderbird Shadow again?

00:19.833 --> 00:21.000
How bad can it be?

00:21.067 --> 00:22.067
(CHUCKLES)

00:22.133 --> 00:23.400
I'll let you finish.

00:23.467 --> 00:27.200
Something may come to light
about my family.

00:27.267 --> 00:29.400

We're gonna have to mobilize,
every one of us.

00:41.200 --> 00:42.533
-Kayo?
-It can wait.

00:42.600 --> 00:45.267
Thanks. All right,
everyone, let's fly!

00:46.800 --> 00:49.767
-Next time, kid.
-I just hope
I'm not too late.

01:51.867 --> 01:53.600
Okay, everyone listen up.

01:53.667 --> 01:56.433
Thunderbird 1, high winds
have trapped a climber
on Mount Huashan.

01:56.500 --> 01:59.067
He's taken shelter
in a crevasse,
but can't get down.

01:59.067 --> 02:00.900
F-A-B!

02:00.967 --> 02:02.667
JOHN: Thunderbird 2,
you've got a cave collapse
nearby the lead.

02:02.733 --> 02:04.633
They need excavation
and heavy lifting gear.

02:04.700 --> 02:05.633
I'm on my way.

02:05.700 --> 02:07.533
Thunderbird 3,
I'm sending co-ordinates now.

02:07.600 --> 02:10.400
A transport shuttle
with a crew of two
has malfunctioned.

02:10.467 --> 02:12.433
You need to kill the engines
and tow them back to orbit.

02:12.500 --> 02:13.333
Piece of cake!

02:13.400 --> 02:14.800
JOHN: Thunderbird 4,

02:14.867 --> 02:16.967
a deep-sea submersible has
sunk in a trench off Saipan.

02:17.067 --> 02:18.600
Passenger status unknown.

02:18.667 --> 02:21.233
Load up what you need,
Thunderbird 2.
I'll launch from the island.

02:21.300 --> 02:23.100
F-A-B. Good luck.

02:23.167 --> 02:25.867
JOHN: Brains, this satellite
commands the global flood
control network

02:25.933 --> 02:27.500
and it's gone offline.

02:27.567 --> 02:29.233
I'll take a pod
from Thunderbird 5
to have a look,

02:29.300 --> 02:31.133
but I'll need you to walk me
through the repairs.

02:31.200 --> 02:32.900
MAX and I
will be standing by.

02:32.967 --> 02:35.333
And I'll take over
monitor duty.

02:35.400 --> 02:37.633
John, you focus
on your own mission.

02:37.700 --> 02:38.900
JOHN: Thanks, Grandma.

02:38.967 --> 02:40.667
Thunderbird Shadow,

02:40.733 --> 02:42.200
someone thought
they could cross
the Great Victoria desert

02:42.267 --> 02:44.067
on a motorbike.

02:44.133 --> 02:46.433
The distress signal is weak,
but I think we can
pinpoint their location.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.733
-I'm on it.
-We all have our missions.

02:48.800 --> 02:49.800
Any questions?

02:49.867 --> 02:51.633
BRAINS: Everything is R-A-D.

02:51.700 --> 02:52.700
R-A-D?

02:52.767 --> 02:54.067
BRAINS: That's my
new catchphrase.

-SCOTT: Go ahead, Shadow.

04:43.667 --> 04:48.500
There's nothing here. I'm not
seeing any sign of anything.

04:48.567 --> 04:50.867
This should be
the exact location
of the signal.

04:50.933 --> 04:52.500
Keep looking.

04:52.567 --> 04:54.433
Whoever sent
that distress call has to be
down there somewhere.

04:54.500 --> 04:55.867
GORDON:
Kayo's not the only one, bro.

04:55.933 --> 04:58.233
This trench is nothing
but a whole lot of empty.

04:58.300 --> 05:00.500
No visuals, scans are clear.

05:00.567 --> 05:03.333
SCOTT: I can assure you,
the distress signals
were genuine.

05:03.400 --> 05:05.067
Something doesn't add up.

05:19.433 --> 05:21.967
Wait a minute.
I've found the bike.

05:22.067 --> 05:24.900
-No rider.
-SCOTT: Could they
have taken shelter somewhere?

05:24.967 --> 05:26.833
Not without
leaving footprints.

05:26.900 --> 05:28.367
Judging from the impact zone,

05:28.433 --> 05:31.367
it looks like this motorbike
was dropped here.

05:36.333 --> 05:37.933
ALAN: This is Thunderbird 3.

05:38.067 --> 05:41.567
I'm pacing the shuttle now,
but no-one is picking
up the phone.

05:41.633 --> 05:45.267
I may have to go EDA and
shut those engines off myself.

05:51.367 --> 05:54.067
Okay, something is definitely
going on here.

05:54.133 --> 05:55.467
I'm missing
my trapped climber.

05:55.533 --> 05:57.500
KAYO: If feels like
we're being tricked, Scott.

05:57.567 --> 05:59.300
We should return
to Tracy Island.

05:59.367 --> 06:01.067
I'm not ready
to call it quits yet.

06:01.067 --> 06:03.267
Let's just focus
on doing our jobs.

06:03.333 --> 06:05.433
That's exactly
what I'm going to do.

06:06.067 --> 06:07.233
I'm leaving.

06:10.100 --> 06:12.167
SCOTT: Kayo, if someone
really is stuck out there...

06:12.233 --> 06:13.800
I left plenty of water
with the bike.

06:13.867 --> 06:15.233
Thunderbird Shadow out.

06:29.733 --> 06:31.600
Hmm, that's not good.

06:31.667 --> 06:34.533
-Brains, can you hear me?
-BRAINS: Yes, Kayo. I'm here.

06:34.600 --> 06:36.967
KAYO: I need you to pull up
the Tracy Island security log.

06:37.067 --> 06:40.200
It looks like someone
has tampered with the fences
along the western perimeter.

06:40.267 --> 06:42.133
Hmm, I believe
you are correct.

06:42.200 --> 06:43.800

06:43.867 --> 06:46.633
get Grandma Tracy and go
to the emergency bunker
immediately.

How familiar are you
with WASP?

07:00.067 --> 07:01.733
LADY PENELOPE:
Wide Area Safety Protocol.

07:01.800 --> 07:03.667
It was the first thing
Jeff Tracy taught me,

07:03.733 --> 07:05.433
when I joined
International Rescue.

07:05.500 --> 07:08.067
Good, we're activating it
right now.

07:08.100 --> 07:09.867
Understood.
How else can I help?

your comm active

07:14.167 --> 07:17.333
Home, Parker. It seems we have
some rather distressing news.

07:17.400 --> 07:20.400
Right away, m'lady.
And what about him?

07:21.900 --> 07:24.367
We can come back
for those stolen plans later.

-You're not the only one.

of explosive device.

08:04.467 --> 08:06.867
You were right about us
being tricked, Kayo.

08:06.933 --> 08:11.167
That's not our only problem.
Tracy Island has a visitor.

08:12.467 --> 08:13.967
Nice view.

08:14.067 --> 08:15.500
I think I'll take it.

08:18.867 --> 08:22.633
-What do you want?
-Tracy Island, of course.

08:22.700 --> 08:24.933
And the Thunderbirds
along with it.

08:25.067 --> 08:29.133
Unless control of the island
is immediately handed over
to me,

08:29.200 --> 08:34.133
International Rescue
will find itself in a
very unfortunate situation.

08:34.200 --> 08:35.700
You lured every one
of us into a trap.

08:35.767 --> 08:39.233
And yet only you were
able to see through it.

08:39.300 --> 08:41.433
The devices at which
your brothers are looking

08:41.500 --> 08:44.133
have been armed
with motion triggers.

08:44.200 --> 08:48.067
I would strongly advise
against any sudden movements.

08:48.133 --> 08:50.267
Such as returning
to your vehicles.

-KAYO: Scott,
are you getting this?
-Every word.

08:53.167 --> 08:54.267
He could be bluffing.

08:54.333 --> 08:56.933
Negative, Thunderbird 2,
this is the real deal.

08:57.067 --> 08:58.067
Don't do it, Kayo.

08:58.100 --> 08:59.100
I'm sorry, Scott.

08:59.167 --> 09:00.567
I won't let him
hurt any of you.

09:00.633 --> 09:03.100
You're just going to have
to trust me on this one.

09:03.167 --> 09:07.133
If you can promise me
no Tracy will be harmed,
I'll give you the island.

09:07.200 --> 09:10.467
When it comes to family,
I'm a man of my word.

09:10.533 --> 09:13.767
The moment you
hand over the island,
I will release them.

09:13.833 --> 09:16.933
-SCOTT: Kayo, you can't!
-I'm sorry, Scott. Comms off.

09:17.067 --> 09:18.333
Search the island!

09:18.400 --> 09:21.633
I don't want any
hidden surprises
when I take possession.

09:21.700 --> 09:24.067
The transfer has to be done
in the control core.

09:26.167 --> 09:27.500
We're taking a ride.

09:37.967 --> 09:41.067
It's funny how our lives
took such different paths.

to save the world.

09:44.200 --> 09:46.333
-And me...
-Bent on destroying it.

09:46.400 --> 09:49.867
Hardly.
I want to build, create.

09:49.933 --> 09:53.567
Sometimes that means
starting with a clean slate.

They're right outside.

09:58.433 --> 10:02.400

they won't stand a chance!

-You know self-defense?
-I'll make them lunch.

10:05.800 --> 10:06.633
Huh?

10:06.700 --> 10:08.300
I admit it,
I'm a terrible cook.

10:08.367 --> 10:11.833
But that confession stays
between you and me. Got it?

11:53.933 --> 11:55.267
I don't have a ship!

12:00.067 --> 12:02.067
The Hood has control
over the island.

12:02.133 --> 12:04.333
That gives him control
over our ships!

12:04.400 --> 12:07.133
He's put them on autopilot
back to home!

12:09.700 --> 12:11.133
This is so not good.

12:12.367 --> 12:15.967

everything I want.

that did the trick.

12:32.333 --> 12:34.333
Speaking of tricks, m'lady,

12:34.400 --> 12:38.133
any chance you can make
this thing disappear?

12:40.833 --> 12:43.433
Whatever Kayo is doing,
I hope she keeps it up.

12:49.600 --> 12:52.333
-I have control again.
-I can confirm that.

12:54.667 --> 12:56.567
Everyone,
return to Tracy Island.

12:56.633 --> 12:59.533
John, call the GDF.
We may need back-up.

12:59.600 --> 13:01.300
That would give away
the island's location.

13:01.367 --> 13:03.267
We don't have a choice.

13:03.333 --> 13:05.167
Kayo may need all the help

13:26.200 --> 13:29.267
I am not amused, Kayo!
What have you done?

13:29.333 --> 13:31.233
The central computer
has been reset.

13:31.300 --> 13:34.833
You no longer have
control of the island

13:34.900 --> 13:38.133
Well, if I can't have
Tracy Island, no one can!

But as soon as they
arrive home, kaboom!

14:02.900 --> 14:04.700
(BEEPING CONTINUES)

14:04.767 --> 14:06.700
And I wouldn't advise
touching that.

14:06.767 --> 14:10.200
Unless you want the light show
to begin early.

14:10.267 --> 14:12.767
International Rescue,
this is Tracy Island.

14:12.833 --> 14:14.267
The Hood has set a trap.

14:14.333 --> 14:17.100
As soon as you return,
he's going to blow up
the power generator.

14:17.167 --> 14:18.967
It will destroy
the entire island.

14:19.067 --> 14:21.967
-You can't come back.
-SCOTT: We're not going
to leave you there.

14:22.067 --> 14:24.133
Scott, you have to trust me.

14:24.200 --> 14:29.267
Trust? Would he trust you,
knowing the secrets
you've been keeping?

14:29.333 --> 14:30.600
Kayo, what's he talking about?

14:30.667 --> 14:34.700
She's been working for me
the whole time.

14:34.767 --> 14:37.067
-That's a lie.
-Is it?

14:37.100 --> 14:41.567
And would I be lying
when I tell them
I'm your uncle?

14:41.633 --> 14:43.267
Kayo, is this true?

14:44.733 --> 14:46.667
Yes, it's true.

14:48.133 --> 14:49.600
The Hood is my uncle.

15:02.200 --> 15:04.300
The Hood is your uncle?

15:04.367 --> 15:07.867
The same evil mastermind
responsible for us losing Dad?

15:07.933 --> 15:09.900
KAYO: This is what
I was trying to tell you.

15:09.967 --> 15:12.567
But I promise,
I am not working for him.

15:12.633 --> 15:13.467
I would never...

15:13.533 --> 15:16.667
It is rather suspicious,
don't you admit?

15:16.733 --> 15:21.300
You, here, safe and sound,
while the others
walk right into a trap?

15:21.367 --> 15:24.467
-That's not...
-And every time
we've been in contact,

15:24.533 --> 15:26.467
not only have I escaped,

15:26.533 --> 15:28.700
I got exactly what I wanted.

15:28.767 --> 15:32.333
You've been my secret weapon
this whole time.

15:32.400 --> 15:34.933
And you didn't even know it!

15:35.067 --> 15:36.133
(GASPS)

15:36.200 --> 15:38.700
Scott, you have to let me
handle this.

15:38.767 --> 15:41.233
-Don't come back. Comms off.
-(BEEPS OFF)

15:41.300 --> 15:44.067
-It doesn't make any sense!
-Actually, it does.

15:44.133 --> 15:47.233
You're not suggesting
she's actively
helping The Hood?

15:47.300 --> 15:49.800
No, but she does keep
a lot of secrets.

15:49.867 --> 15:51.500
It's Kayo.
We can trust her.

15:51.567 --> 15:53.867
Even if we do,
can she handle this
on her own?

15:53.933 --> 15:56.767
-Yes, she can.
-I don't know, Scott.

15:56.833 --> 15:58.433
It's going to be hard.

15:58.500 --> 16:02.567
There's only one question
we need to be
asking ourselves now.

16:04.300 --> 16:06.133
What would Dad do?

16:06.200 --> 16:08.067
(BEEPING)

16:11.900 --> 16:16.633
Since you're family,
I'll allow you
the favor of escape.

16:17.700 --> 16:19.733
I hope you can
handle the climb.

16:23.933 --> 16:25.600
(BEEPING)

16:31.067 --> 16:32.500
(LAUGHS)

16:34.333 --> 16:36.700
-Huh?
-Your plan to blow up
Tracy Island

16:36.767 --> 16:38.433
has one small problem.

16:38.500 --> 16:40.867
We're not on Tracy Island.

16:40.933 --> 16:44.067
Welcome to Mateo Island.
Right next door.

16:44.100 --> 16:46.267
No, no, no!

16:46.333 --> 16:49.100
Sure, we'll be sad to see
our back-up generator go.

16:49.167 --> 16:52.767
But it won't be the end of
International Rescue
or Tracy Island.

16:52.833 --> 16:54.067
Not by a long shot.

16:54.133 --> 16:55.500
(SCREAMS)

16:55.567 --> 16:59.700
For this, you get
to swim home after all!

16:59.767 --> 17:02.333
Assuming you can
escape the blast!

17:03.933 --> 17:05.133
(BLASTS)

17:13.767 --> 17:14.700
Brains?

17:14.767 --> 17:17.100
Everything is under control
here, Kayo.

17:17.167 --> 17:20.567
You two look hungry.
How about a snack?

17:22.567 --> 17:24.067
(MUMBLING)

17:24.100 --> 17:27.067
Check your monitors.
I could use a hand out here.

17:27.067 --> 17:28.267
R-A-D.

17:51.833 --> 17:54.067
(BEEPING)

17:57.967 --> 17:59.200
Argh!

18:22.567 --> 18:24.300
(PANTS)

18:33.333 --> 18:37.267
No, no! Stop!
What are you doing?

18:53.467 --> 18:55.200
(SCREAMS)

19:06.100 --> 19:09.400
Scott, I thought I told you
it wasn't safe
to come back here.

19:09.467 --> 19:11.867
You also said to trust you
to handle this.

19:11.933 --> 19:14.267
And you did.

19:14.333 --> 19:17.267
You may want to consider
disarming that present
you left us.

19:17.333 --> 19:20.633
Unless you want to be the one
swimming home.

19:21.900 --> 19:24.067
(GROWLS)

19:24.133 --> 19:28.067
The Hood, captured at last.

19:28.067 --> 19:29.967
Well done, Kayo.

19:30.067 --> 19:31.700
(HOOD GROWLS)

19:31.767 --> 19:34.233
It was only a matter of time
before he tried
to capture Tracy Island.

19:34.300 --> 19:37.167
Luring him to Mateo Island
and activating WASP

19:37.233 --> 19:39.400
was always part
of my contingency plan.

19:39.467 --> 19:41.767
You may think
this insincere, Kayo.

19:41.833 --> 19:45.233
But you've made
your dear old uncle
very proud.

19:46.800 --> 19:48.267
Be sure to write!

19:55.167 --> 19:57.367
I think we have
a conversation to finish.

20:06.500 --> 20:09.800
You have to know I would never
knowingly help my uncle.

20:09.867 --> 20:12.767
Every time he got away,
it only made me hate him more.

20:12.833 --> 20:14.733
We wouldn't dream
of thinking otherwise, Kayo.

20:14.800 --> 20:16.900
Keeping it a secret
was your father's idea.

20:16.967 --> 20:20.400
He didn't want
my family history
to be a distraction.

20:20.467 --> 20:22.200
Well, if Dad wanted
this a secret,

20:22.267 --> 20:23.667
that's good enough for me.

20:25.067 --> 20:26.600
It's still hard
to believe he's gone.

20:26.667 --> 20:28.967
Your father may not
be in this room,

20:29.033 --> 20:31.167
but he'll always
be with us, Alan.

20:31.233 --> 20:33.800
International Rescue
was his gift to the world.

20:33.867 --> 20:36.967
Everyone in this room
is keeping that gift alive.

20:37.033 --> 20:41.133
He would be so proud
of each and every one of you.

20:41.200 --> 20:43.400
Now, who wants some dinner?

20:43.467 --> 20:44.600
(GROANING)

20:44.667 --> 20:45.700
I'm kidding!

20:45.767 --> 20:47.733
Kidding or not,
dinner will have to wait.

20:47.800 --> 20:50.467
We've got a situation.
I'm gonna need everyone.

20:50.533 --> 20:54.033
Then it looks like
Thunderbirds are go!

21:11.067 --> 21:12.567
Come to gloat, have you?

21:12.633 --> 21:16.633
You're being transferred
to Parkmoor Scrubs prison.

21:16.700 --> 21:20.933
No one is going to see you
for a long, long time.

21:21.067 --> 21:23.267
And that makes the world safe?

21:23.333 --> 21:26.600
I happen to know
what's coming next, Colonel.

21:26.667 --> 21:31.067
If you and
International Rescue
thought I was bad...

21:31.067 --> 21:33.433
(LAUGHS)

21:33.500 --> 21:36.433
Just you wait!
