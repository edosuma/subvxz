WEBVTT

00:05.005 --> 00:07.872
Oh, man. All right.
Thank you, Heidi.

00:07.941 --> 00:09.499
Thank you. I think it's done.

00:09.576 --> 00:10.941
Well!

00:11.845 --> 00:13.142
I guess that finishes up

00:13.213 --> 00:16.580
our cooking portion of our salute
to a mars Thanksgiving.

00:16.683 --> 00:19.550
A point to ponder when you baste
the turkey in cognac,

00:19.619 --> 00:22.349
you want to keep the bird away
from the open flame.

00:23.089 --> 00:25.956
Otherwise your Butterball
will become a fireball.

00:27.227 --> 00:28.990
Pretty obvious, isn't it?

00:29.062 --> 00:32.930
Now it's time to look at some of the
things we men should be thankful for.

00:34.134 --> 00:37.797
And this, of course,
would be number one: women.

00:37.871 --> 00:41.307
Our mothers, our co-workers,
our family members, our sisters.

00:41.374 --> 00:43.239
They deserve a lot of appreciation.

00:43.309 --> 00:45.243
- Wow. Thank you, Tim.
- You're welcome.

00:45.311 --> 00:47.643
Now, get lost.
It's a mars segment.

00:49.282 --> 00:53.412
OK, Al. Well, you're sort of a man.
What are you thankful for?

00:55.355 --> 00:59.018
Well, Tim, I'm thankful for the tool
I carry with me always.

01:00.393 --> 01:02.953
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Al!
It's a family show!

01:03.029 --> 01:05.930
I'm talking about my Swiss Army knife.

01:05.999 --> 01:07.967
I would feel naked without it.

01:08.501 --> 01:09.968
Ew.

01:11.438 --> 01:14.498
I'm talking about the gizmos
and gadgets and thingamajigs

01:14.574 --> 01:17.543
- that make a mars life won'thwhile.
- I hear you, brother.

01:17.610 --> 01:21.307
How many times have you found yourself
at the beach or a tailgate party

01:21.381 --> 01:24.077
and you're longing for
a zesty blended beverage?

01:24.150 --> 01:27.119
Not a problem anymore
with this model of American ingenuity.

01:27.187 --> 01:30.088
All it takes is one rip...

01:38.398 --> 01:40.958
This next gadget's on the top
of my list of favorites.

01:41.067 --> 01:45.026
You may be thinking I'm wearing
usual coveralls, but you're wrong.

01:45.138 --> 01:49.871
I'm sporting the practical
and very fashionable vacu-suit.

01:51.678 --> 01:54.613
That's right,
from the Binford winter collection.

01:54.681 --> 01:58.378
<i>You've got to say "tr√®s chic"
when you look at Al right now.</i>

01:58.451 --> 02:01.614
The point of this is,
why lug around a heavy vacuum cleaner?

02:01.688 --> 02:04.555
- We can add the vacuum to the man.
- Right.

02:05.558 --> 02:07.389
- Just add a hose to Al...
- Mm-hmm.

02:08.161 --> 02:09.719
Not there, Tim!

02:11.498 --> 02:13.762
He's got a built-in
compressor and motor.

02:13.833 --> 02:15.391
Flip him on and watch Al suck.

02:19.606 --> 02:22.632
Uh, Tim...
Tim, I think we have a problem!

02:22.709 --> 02:24.870
Turn it off!
Turn it off, Tim!

02:24.978 --> 02:26.445
Turn it off, Tim!

02:26.513 --> 02:28.208
Ah!

02:32.552 --> 02:33.917
Tim!

02:35.000 --> 02:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:27.807 --> 03:29.741
Wilson, I thought that you and Willow

03:29.809 --> 03:32.175
were going to Ann Arbor
for Thanksgiving.

03:32.245 --> 03:34.270
We're gonna leave
as soon as I finish

03:34.347 --> 03:37.714
<i>making my feng shui
home protection tool.</i>

03:37.784 --> 03:38.944
How does that work?

03:39.052 --> 03:43.011
Well, Jill, the horizontal flute
is the guardian of hopes and desires.

03:43.089 --> 03:47.355
And the two angled flutes radiate peace
throughout the house and the universe.

03:47.427 --> 03:50.692
- What do the red tassels do?
- They scare away squirrels.

03:51.531 --> 03:54.364
What are the holiday plans
for the Taylors this year?

03:54.434 --> 03:57.164
Well, my mom is gonna be
with my sister in Texas.

03:57.237 --> 04:01.196
Tim's mom is gonna be with his brother,
Jeff, so it's just the five of us.

04:01.274 --> 04:04.607
I thought maybe I'd get up early
and try out some new recipes.

04:04.677 --> 04:07.145
- Why new recipes?
- Everybody hates my cooking,

04:07.213 --> 04:10.376
so I thought I might as well
make it interesting for me.

04:11.517 --> 04:15.453
- Oh, hi. How's it going, Jill?
- Hey, Willow.

04:15.521 --> 04:17.613
Oh, that's a great looking turkey.

04:17.690 --> 04:20.716
Actually, it's 100 percent soybean.

04:20.793 --> 04:23.057
It's called a "soy-key".

04:25.665 --> 04:27.826
I am so looking forward to Thanksgiving.

04:27.934 --> 04:31.870
It's the first time in years that the
whole Wilson clan has all been together.

04:31.938 --> 04:34.372
- Uncle Wilbur.
- Aunt Willemina.

04:34.440 --> 04:36.806
- Cousin Wilford.
- Uncle Willard.

04:36.909 --> 04:39.469
- Grandma Wilma.
- And Bob.

04:39.579 --> 04:41.479
- Bob?
- He's the black sheep.

04:41.547 --> 04:44.641
Ah. Well, every family
has to have a troublemaker.

04:44.717 --> 04:48.653
No, no, no. Bob is a very nice sheep.
He just gets cranky at shearing time.

04:50.757 --> 04:52.987
Hey, Bradley.
I got great news.

04:53.059 --> 04:56.119
You pumped so much air into Al,
he's bigger than his mom.

04:57.730 --> 04:59.823
No, that would be quite impossible.

05:00.533 --> 05:03.900
<i>Get this. Clay Ford, the owner
of the Lions, is a big Tool Time fan.</i>

05:03.970 --> 05:07.428
He's offered us the use of a luxury box
for the Thanksgiving game.

05:07.507 --> 05:09.475
Our own private box?
That is so cool.

05:09.575 --> 05:11.805
Yeah, there's just one annoying detail.

05:11.878 --> 05:13.971
And there she is.

05:15.915 --> 05:17.075
- Hi.
- Hi.

05:17.150 --> 05:19.311
What do you think about a soy turkey?

05:19.385 --> 05:20.875
Hey, I'm up for anything.

05:20.953 --> 05:24.787
You know what I believe, that no matter
what you eat or where you eat it,

05:24.857 --> 05:28.156
Thanksgiving is great
as long as we're all together.

05:31.164 --> 05:33.860
We are not gonna spend Thanksgiving
at a car show.

05:33.933 --> 05:35.833
Don't be ridiculous.
Now, listen.

05:35.902 --> 05:39.201
We've been offered a luxury box
at the Silverdome.

05:39.272 --> 05:43.038
We can enjoy an incredible Thanksgiving
dinner in the privacy of our own room.

05:43.142 --> 05:47.238
You're saying you'd rather spend the day
in a football stadium

05:47.313 --> 05:50.771
being served Thanksgiving meal
by total strangers?

05:50.850 --> 05:53.182
- Yes.
- Hot damn! I'm sleeping in.

05:53.252 --> 05:54.981
All right.

05:59.759 --> 06:01.386
Check out the view.

06:03.429 --> 06:05.363
Wow. This is really beautiful.

06:05.431 --> 06:08.992
- Yeah, if you like disgusting opulence.
- And I do.

06:10.269 --> 06:13.636
I don't believe it.
There is a TV in the bathroom.

06:13.706 --> 06:16.072
So you won't miss a minute
of the excitement.

06:16.175 --> 06:17.870
Or in your case, 45 minutes.

06:20.012 --> 06:23.140
Hello, Taylor family.
Welcome to box 12.

06:29.255 --> 06:33.521
I'm Ted, your personal Silverdome
liaison and I've got hats.

06:33.593 --> 06:36.619
Oh, thank you.
I'm Jill Taylor.

06:36.696 --> 06:40.029
And that's Randy, Mark and Brad
and my husband, Tim Taylor.

06:40.099 --> 06:42.363
Hey, it's "The Tool Man."

06:42.435 --> 06:44.164
"Oh! Oh!"

06:48.107 --> 06:51.076
Good to meet you, Ted.
Um, you look awful familiar.

06:51.144 --> 06:52.372
Have we met before?

06:52.445 --> 06:55.278
No. Perhaps you've met
one of my brothers.

06:55.348 --> 06:57.009
Ned or Fred?

06:57.083 --> 07:00.246
Wait a minute. One brother works
at the airport in Alpena.

07:00.353 --> 07:03.914
And the other brother at a gas station
in the middle of nowhere. I met 'em.

07:04.023 --> 07:07.459
Yes. I hope they didn't
give you any trouble.

07:07.527 --> 07:09.495
They've always been pretty ornery.

07:09.562 --> 07:13.430
One time they held me down
and packed my nose with candy corn.

07:14.700 --> 07:16.793
Kids can be so cruel.

07:16.869 --> 07:18.837
This was last Christmas.

07:20.606 --> 07:22.574
By the way, Tim, I've been authorized

07:22.675 --> 07:25.439
to give you a tour
of the Silverdome's nerve center.

07:26.078 --> 07:29.844
Home of our state-of-the-art
electrical and plumbing system.

07:29.949 --> 07:34.010
- Somebody pinch me!
- You can watch the game on the monitors

07:34.086 --> 07:37.249
and I'll have you back at halftime
for dinner with your family.

07:37.323 --> 07:39.848
- Thank you, Ted.
- I'll be up to get you in a while.

07:39.926 --> 07:41.860
- All right.
- Thank you.

07:41.928 --> 07:43.793
Would you look at all this food?

07:43.863 --> 07:47.594
Do you know how many needy families
it could have fed on Thanksgiving?

07:47.667 --> 07:49.032
Ooh. Crab puffs.

07:50.703 --> 07:55.436
Sorry I'm late. I ran into
Harry Belafonte at the VIP elevator.

07:55.508 --> 07:57.476
What a chatterbox.

08:01.814 --> 08:04.374
- I'm sorry. You would be...?
- Irv Schmayman.

08:04.450 --> 08:06.350
Major television producer.

08:06.419 --> 08:09.684
- And you are...?
- Tim Taylor, major television star.

08:09.755 --> 08:11.382
- Taylor.
- Yeah.

08:11.457 --> 08:12.685
Never heard of you.

08:13.693 --> 08:15.991
Well, maybe you have the wrong booth.

08:16.062 --> 08:19.225
Box 12.
The Lions front office set me up.

08:19.332 --> 08:22.426
Didrt you say this booth
was just gonna be for our family?

08:22.502 --> 08:25.403
Hey, we are all
in the entertainment family.

08:25.471 --> 08:29.237
All part of the business
I like to call, "Show."

08:31.110 --> 08:33.078
Well, Irv, this is my wife, Jill

08:33.179 --> 08:36.239
and these are my boys,
Randy, Brad and Mark.

08:36.315 --> 08:37.839
Irv Schmayman.

08:37.917 --> 08:39.475
Hollywood legend.

08:41.520 --> 08:43.546
Here's my card.
Pass it around, kid.

08:44.657 --> 08:46.921
Well, so much
for our family Thanksgiving.

08:46.993 --> 08:48.824
Honey, it's just one Schmayman.

08:51.297 --> 08:52.525
Girls?

08:55.167 --> 08:58.136
These are my personal assistants,
Jenny and Cindy.

08:58.204 --> 09:01.071
They're going to be joining us
for Thanksgiving.

09:01.140 --> 09:03.370
Now I've got something
to be thankful for.

09:06.546 --> 09:09.413
- All right, Lions won!
- The game just started.

09:09.482 --> 09:11.109
No, they won the coin toss.

09:13.586 --> 09:17.920
The holiday season always reminds me
of my Helen Reddy special,

09:17.990 --> 09:19.958
<i>Reddy or Not, It's Christmas.</i>

09:21.060 --> 09:22.891
It was a ratings volcano.

09:23.863 --> 09:26.559
Are you guys gonna
watch the game or chat?

09:26.632 --> 09:30.762
Whoa, relax, Timski. I've got friends
at the network. I'll get you a tape.

09:30.836 --> 09:33.396
Excuse me. Mr. Taylor?

09:33.506 --> 09:36.669
Are you ready to explore
the bowels of the Silverdome?

09:36.742 --> 09:38.505
Let me loose.

09:39.312 --> 09:42.372
Tim, can I speak to you for a moment?
He'll be right there.

09:44.250 --> 09:47.014
You cannot leave us alone
with the Schmayman,

09:49.121 --> 09:51.055
Jill, Jill, Jill.

09:51.123 --> 09:53.421
Thanksgiving is about compassion.

09:54.026 --> 09:56.085
It's about reaching out to others.

09:56.162 --> 09:58.460
It's about being there for other people.

09:59.465 --> 10:00.796
Gotta go.

10:04.236 --> 10:08.002
These are the transformers
and all the breakers.

10:08.641 --> 10:11.405
I love spending time down here.

10:11.477 --> 10:13.104
Who wouldn't?

10:13.179 --> 10:15.079
The place is so homey.

10:16.349 --> 10:19.216
If you like this,
wait till you see our control room.

10:19.285 --> 10:22.152
That's where we operate
all of the Silverdome's lights

10:22.221 --> 10:24.086
and our 2,000 toilets.

10:24.156 --> 10:26.624
Wait a minute.
Two thousand toilets?

10:27.893 --> 10:31.329
Is there a button you can press
to flush them all at once?

10:31.397 --> 10:34.298
No, but I'll bring it up
at the next board meeting.

10:34.367 --> 10:37.393
You're a thinker.
I like that.

10:37.470 --> 10:41.236
So, finally, I tell the network,
"You've got a great idea.

10:41.340 --> 10:42.705
But the show needs a twist.

10:42.775 --> 10:45.505
You want funny?
Make the nun fly."

10:48.147 --> 10:51.480
If your father doesn't get back soon
I'm gonna have to kill him.

10:51.550 --> 10:53.245
Dad or Schmayman?

10:54.186 --> 10:55.619
Whoever's closest.

11:01.827 --> 11:05.695
I've been so blessed. I have this
superhuman feel for what's funny.

11:05.765 --> 11:09.064
Pants are funny.
Pork is funny.

11:09.135 --> 11:10.500
Fish are funny.

11:10.603 --> 11:12.230
I think I might vomit.

11:12.304 --> 11:13.828
Vomit, big funny.

11:16.442 --> 11:18.410
Ted, I can't thank you enough.

11:19.278 --> 11:23.237
If I can put a smile on "The Tool Mars"
face, my dream has come true.

11:23.315 --> 11:26.580
- You really mean that?
- No, I'm just being a good host.

11:28.054 --> 11:31.285
Before you go back to your family,
I have one more surprise for you.

11:31.357 --> 11:33.621
I don't think my heart can take it.
Let me guess.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.923
An autographed copy
of the building permit.

11:35.995 --> 11:38.555
Hey, I'm a liaison.
I'm not God.

11:40.533 --> 11:44.264
Smile, "Tool Man".
You're on Jumbo Vision.

11:44.336 --> 11:46.099
- No, no. The big screen?
- Yeah.

11:46.172 --> 11:48.265
This is cool.

11:53.245 --> 11:55.338
That is one beautiful turkey.

11:58.350 --> 12:02.309
I pitched a series to CBS
about a talking turkey.

12:02.388 --> 12:04.822
They told me to stuff it.

12:07.359 --> 12:09.657
Hello! Is this thing on?

12:12.698 --> 12:14.529
This is a nightmare.

12:15.101 --> 12:18.434
Hey, look.
Dad's on Jumbo Vision.

12:18.504 --> 12:23.271
<i>On Jumbo Vision,
our special guest, Tim "The Tool Man"...</i>

12:23.375 --> 12:24.933
Look at that.

12:25.010 --> 12:28.070
The contrast on these monitors is bad.
Let me work on this.

12:28.147 --> 12:29.808
No, Tim.
Don't touch anything!

12:29.882 --> 12:33.147
I'm in the business, Ted.
I know how to work these things.

12:35.688 --> 12:38.122
This is specially made
for the Silverdome...

12:38.190 --> 12:40.283
Oh, my God.

12:49.635 --> 12:53.196
Dad just ruined Thanksgiving
for 80,000 people.

12:54.573 --> 12:58.134
- I'm gonna grab a yam.
- That's not a yam, Irv.

13:04.917 --> 13:08.045
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
please remain seated.</i>

13:08.120 --> 13:12.386
<i>The lights should be back on as soon
as someone figures out how to fix them.</i>

13:13.626 --> 13:15.958
How long do you think it'll take
to fix this?

13:16.028 --> 13:21.330
You better hope it's fast, because every
person in this stadium saw what you did.

13:21.400 --> 13:24.130
Some of them were probably
in the bathroom.

13:25.070 --> 13:27.561
Yeah. Those guys will be real happy.

13:31.410 --> 13:34.436
Let "The Tool Man" in there.
I work great under pressure.

13:34.513 --> 13:37.482
Oh, no, you don't.
Sit down and don't touch anything.

13:37.550 --> 13:42.578
The more I think about it,
your toilet flushing button idea stunk.

13:44.490 --> 13:48.358
I think I understand why your brothers
shoved candy corn up your nose.

13:52.631 --> 13:54.895
Boy, this takes me back.

13:54.967 --> 13:59.836
January, 1994, the earthquake hit
and wiped out the power

13:59.905 --> 14:02.465
while Tina Turner was staying
in my guest house.

14:02.541 --> 14:04.475
So, let me guess.

14:04.543 --> 14:07.876
You went next door and borrowed
a flashlight from David Bowie.

14:07.947 --> 14:12.111
You know, Jillsie, we Schmaymans
are pretty perceptive people.

14:12.184 --> 14:16.518
and I am picking up a hint of sarcasm
on my "Schmaydar."

14:22.328 --> 14:23.886
Hey, Schmayman.

14:25.497 --> 14:26.759
Hey.

14:27.333 --> 14:28.891
What can I tell you, huh?

14:32.671 --> 14:35.765
- Hey, Rodney.
- I had a hard time finding you.

14:35.841 --> 14:39.072
After they saw my face
they turned off all the lights.

14:40.479 --> 14:42.572
Rodney starred in my Christmas special.

14:42.648 --> 14:44.479
<i>I Don't Get No Respect: On Ice.</i>

14:44.550 --> 14:46.609
Oh, and I'll tell you, it was cold.

14:46.685 --> 14:50.644
It was so cold, it was colder than
my wife's handshake on our honeymoon.

14:51.657 --> 14:53.215
- Hello.
- How do you do, baby.

14:53.325 --> 14:56.488
I'm Jill Taylor.
I can't believe it's Rodney Dangerfield.

14:56.595 --> 15:00.087
- What are you doing in Detroit?
- Looking for plugs and points.

15:02.501 --> 15:05.470
I was the Grand Marshal
at the Great American Parade.

15:05.537 --> 15:10.474
And if they made me the Grand Marshal,
how great can America be, you know?

15:11.877 --> 15:14.402
Mom? Who's Rodney Dangerfield?

15:15.714 --> 15:18.478
Honey, he's a famous comic.
He's hilarious.

15:18.550 --> 15:23.078
What's with the black outfit?
Devil worshipers are in box 666.

15:25.124 --> 15:27.592
- You are good.
- Thanks, shorty.

15:31.730 --> 15:34.028
When I was a kid, I was short myself.

15:34.099 --> 15:37.227
I was so short I had to blow my nose
through my fly.

15:47.546 --> 15:49.514
Are you this funny at home?

15:49.581 --> 15:51.879
Not since my wife's mother moved in.

15:52.651 --> 15:54.516
What a barracuda.

15:55.354 --> 15:57.481
My husband will be sorry he missed you.

15:57.556 --> 16:01.219
Would you consider staying
and having Thanksgiving dinner with us?

16:01.293 --> 16:03.193
That's very kind of you.
I'd love to.

16:03.262 --> 16:06.288
When I was a kid I had it rough.
We were poor.

16:06.365 --> 16:08.299
How poor were you?

16:09.301 --> 16:13.260
How poor? On Thanksgiving my old man
showed us a picture of a turkey.

16:15.474 --> 16:18.238
I sat there all day
trying to lick the gravy.

16:22.114 --> 16:25.083
Bad news. If we don't
get the lights fixed in 15 minutes,

16:25.150 --> 16:26.811
the game is cancelled.

16:26.885 --> 16:28.978
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

16:29.054 --> 16:33.081
I believe one time I saved some time
by wiring around the circuit breaker.

16:33.158 --> 16:36.059
Couldrt that cause the transformer
to blow up?

16:36.128 --> 16:37.686
If memory serves, yes.

16:38.931 --> 16:40.592
Why don't you go to your family?

16:40.666 --> 16:42.827
I'm not gonna
walk across the Silverdome.

16:42.935 --> 16:45.495
There might be people out there
that want my blood.

16:45.604 --> 16:46.764
I'm aware of that.

16:54.046 --> 16:57.607
Wow. Look at all these people. This is
turning into one heck of a party.

16:57.716 --> 17:00.276
What can I say?
In the face of tragedy, I host.

17:01.520 --> 17:04.284
Mr. Dangerfield,
I hope I'm not speaking out of turn,

17:04.390 --> 17:07.358
but you seem to have
some self-esteem issues.

17:07.425 --> 17:08.983
Oh, you can say that again.

17:09.094 --> 17:11.460
When I was born
the doctor smacked my mother.

17:13.866 --> 17:16.960
Rodney, remember our special?
You were doing your act,

17:17.036 --> 17:19.868
and Aretha Franklin skated out
onto the ice.

17:19.938 --> 17:22.304
And she sang that song to me
all about respect.

17:22.407 --> 17:24.968
Oh, yeah, I taught that song
to you guys.

17:25.077 --> 17:28.740
<i>* R-E-S-P-E-C-T
Find out what it means to me</i>

17:28.814 --> 17:31.647
<i>* Sock it to me, sock it to me
Sock it to me, sock it to me</i>

17:31.717 --> 17:34.242
That's enough "sock it to me", OK?

17:34.319 --> 17:37.777
Reminds me of my neighborhood.
My neighborhood is tough.

17:37.856 --> 17:41.019
They said to a kid in school,
"What comes after a sentence?"

17:41.093 --> 17:42.720
He said, "You make an appeal."

17:48.434 --> 17:52.393
I just wanted to have a nice
Thanksgiving dinner with my family.

17:52.471 --> 17:54.371
Look what happened!

17:58.143 --> 17:59.610
Sorry!

18:00.479 --> 18:02.003
Wait. Do that again.

18:02.081 --> 18:03.446
Sorry!

18:04.950 --> 18:07.282
No, no, hit the console.

18:14.560 --> 18:16.118
What were you worried about?

18:19.198 --> 18:22.361
So long, Charo.
Coochie-coochie.

18:23.836 --> 18:25.701
Hey, the lights are back on!

18:25.771 --> 18:28.433
Yeah, the players
are headed back onto the field.

18:28.507 --> 18:31.442
Hey, listen, I got a massage at my hotel
in ten minutes.

18:31.977 --> 18:34.070
Taylor family, can I be frank?

18:34.146 --> 18:38.310
This has been the most moving,
enjoyable holiday I have ever had.

18:38.383 --> 18:41.147
And that includes Passover
with the Tony Curtises.

18:41.220 --> 18:43.688
Thank you.

18:43.755 --> 18:46.986
- Thank you. Good-bye.
- God bless you. I mean it. Stay well.

18:47.059 --> 18:49.425
OK. Thanks.

18:49.495 --> 18:52.658
Oh. Can you believe
that this actually happened?

18:52.764 --> 18:54.698
Oh, yes, that was unbelievable.

18:54.766 --> 18:57.496
You know, Jenny told me to call her
when I'm 21.

18:59.404 --> 19:02.430
Yeah, and Irv wants first look
at my next screenplay.

19:02.508 --> 19:05.966
I'm reconsidering my distaste
for conspicuous consumption.

19:07.179 --> 19:08.874
Ooh. Dibs on the last truffle.

19:11.416 --> 19:14.783
Hey, I'm sorry I wrecked
your Thanksgiving, OK.

19:14.887 --> 19:16.582
No! You kidding?
It was great.

19:16.655 --> 19:18.680
It was the best Thanksgiving ever.

19:18.757 --> 19:21.726
We got to hang out
with Rodney Dangerfield.

19:21.827 --> 19:25.695
It was wild.
It was like my neighborhood.

19:25.764 --> 19:27.925
You know, my neighborhood was so wild,

19:28.000 --> 19:30.935
when the kids played hopscotch
they used real scotch.

19:33.238 --> 19:36.401
Trying to cheer me up
is getting pathetic here, OK?

19:36.508 --> 19:39.671
Hey, Jill, I forgot to give you
my phone number in L.A.

19:39.745 --> 19:43.112
If you get to L.A., bring the family.
We'll have a barbeque, OK?

19:43.182 --> 19:46.310
And you'll meet my doctor,
Dr. Vinnie Boombach.

19:48.187 --> 19:51.918
I saw him last week and asked him
if my heart was strong enough for sex.

19:51.990 --> 19:53.890
He told me not if I join in.

19:56.895 --> 20:00.058
Rodney Dangerfield, I'm Tim Taylor.
I'm her husband.

20:00.132 --> 20:03.568
Oh, yeah. You're the knucklehead
who screwed up the lights, huh?

20:04.603 --> 20:06.935
If you get to L.A.
just bring the kids, OK?

20:08.840 --> 20:10.774
You take it easy.
I hope I run into you.

20:10.842 --> 20:12.400
When I'm driving!

20:20.252 --> 20:21.879
<i>And welcome back to Tool Time.</i>

20:21.954 --> 20:24.855
Today we're going to restore
antique picture frames.

20:24.923 --> 20:28.791
Because under an ugly exterior
sometimes you can find a true beauty.

20:28.860 --> 20:31.624
That's not the case...
Oh, never mind.

20:31.697 --> 20:35.531
OK, uh... To help us out today
we have a very special guest.

20:36.268 --> 20:39.567
The Grand Marshal of the
Great American Parade doesn't like me,

20:39.638 --> 20:41.367
<i>but evidently, he likes Tool Time.</i>

20:41.440 --> 20:45.274
That's why he's here. Let's give
a warm welcome to Rodney Dangerfield.

20:52.184 --> 20:55.813
Here, honey.
Buy the rest of that dress, will ya?

20:58.056 --> 21:01.355
- Over here, Rodney.
- Ooh, could she break up a happy home.

21:02.327 --> 21:04.887
- Great to have you on the show.
- A pleasure.

21:04.963 --> 21:06.726
What are we working on today, boys?

21:06.832 --> 21:10.063
We're gonna refinish this frame
for a husky picture Al's got.

21:10.135 --> 21:14.003
Speaking of husky, I understand you
were a husky kid. How husky were you?

21:14.072 --> 21:17.235
I'm not here to do jokes.
I'm here to help Al with a project.

21:20.112 --> 21:24.481
I hear that you were poor and lived
in the projects. How poor were you?

21:25.517 --> 21:27.451
None of your business.

21:28.387 --> 21:30.947
What kind of wood are we using
in this frame?

21:31.023 --> 21:33.548
- Distressed maple.
- Speaking of distressed,

21:33.625 --> 21:36.753
I understand your wife is annoying.
How annoying is she?

21:36.828 --> 21:38.796
Not as annoying as you.

21:40.399 --> 21:42.128
How do you work with this guy, huh?

21:42.200 --> 21:44.964
It's tough. I gotta tell ya,
I don't get any respect.

21:46.338 --> 21:48.169
You're talking to the original.

21:48.240 --> 21:50.208
'Cause I don't get no respect at all.

21:50.275 --> 21:53.403
I got no sex life.
My wife cut me down to once a month.

21:53.478 --> 21:56.447
I'm lucky.
Two guys I know she cut out completely.
