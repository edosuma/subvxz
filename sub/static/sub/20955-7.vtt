WEBVTT

00:01.402 --> 00:04.538
TERESA: Previously on
"Queen of the South"...

00:04.572 --> 00:05.573
I deal in nothing less
than metric tons.

00:05.606 --> 00:07.575
We'll take the ton.

00:07.608 --> 00:09.210
EL SANTO: I shall expect the
first payment within the week.

00:09.243 --> 00:10.244
-(giggles)
-This is my wife, Kelly Anne.

00:10.278 --> 00:11.745
Hi.

00:11.779 --> 00:13.214
CAMILA: I need you to do
something for me.

00:13.247 --> 00:15.349
Camila Vargas is
a cold-blooded criminal.

00:15.383 --> 00:16.984
GARRETT: She'll get word soon
that we're here

00:17.017 --> 00:19.253
and now we come for
whatever she's got left.

00:19.287 --> 00:20.754
(gunshot)
Ah.

00:20.788 --> 00:22.490
Where's my mom?

00:22.523 --> 00:24.558
There's something I couldn't
tell you over the phone.

00:24.592 --> 00:27.895
I pray that you remember me
as the man that I aspired to be.

00:27.928 --> 00:30.030
I'm so proud of you.

00:32.633 --> 00:34.335
(intense music)

00:34.368 --> 00:36.204
(moaning)

00:39.540 --> 00:40.574
(grunts)

00:44.545 --> 00:47.681
(panting)

00:47.715 --> 00:49.317
Ah.

00:51.719 --> 00:52.986
(sighs)

01:21.182 --> 01:22.583
(phone buzzing)

01:31.859 --> 01:34.828
(dark music)

01:34.862 --> 01:41.869
*

01:44.672 --> 01:46.039
(sighs)

01:49.877 --> 01:52.646
Do you understand
there's no way

01:52.680 --> 01:55.483
we can distribute this amount?

01:55.516 --> 01:57.318
I do.

01:57.351 --> 01:59.253
And do you understand
that if we don't

01:59.287 --> 02:02.590
get that first payment,
a fleet of El Santo's hit men

02:02.623 --> 02:04.425
are gonna be on
the next flight to Dallas.

02:04.458 --> 02:06.093
El Santo gave us no choice.

02:06.126 --> 02:07.861
I don't remember asking you
a damn thing.

02:07.895 --> 02:10.298
TERESA: He said take
a metric ton or nothing.

02:10.331 --> 02:13.267
I understand
it put us in danger.

02:13.301 --> 02:14.868
So why'd you do it?

02:14.902 --> 02:17.605
Because now you have a choice.

02:17.638 --> 02:20.107
With nothing, you don't.

02:20.140 --> 02:23.143
It was a gamble.
I made it alone.

02:30.384 --> 02:32.019
Well done, Teresa.

02:32.052 --> 02:34.455
Gonna need a word
with you, James.

02:34.488 --> 02:40.794
*

02:40.828 --> 02:44.164
(door opens, closes)

02:44.198 --> 02:45.699
Why is he still alive?

02:45.733 --> 02:47.401
He saved my life
when he didn't have to.

02:48.202 --> 02:50.871
Teresa made a direct connection
with El Santo.

02:50.904 --> 02:53.741
We take out our man, we risk
losing our only supplier.

02:53.774 --> 02:56.043
You're making
judgment calls now?

02:56.076 --> 02:58.145
Teresa makes 'em,
you pat her on the back.

02:58.178 --> 02:59.747
I make 'em, I'm insubordinate.

02:59.780 --> 03:01.749
She did exactly what
I asked her to do and more.

03:01.782 --> 03:04.485
You're defying me.

03:04.518 --> 03:07.355
We're gonna need to prepare this
location for operations quickly.

03:07.388 --> 03:09.557
And you're gonna
set it up properly.

03:09.590 --> 03:12.926
All right, we'll make a start
on the distro.

03:12.960 --> 03:15.896
No, you take care
of your new best friend.

03:15.929 --> 03:18.098
El Guero is
your responsibility now

03:18.131 --> 03:20.033
until I decided
what to do with him.

03:20.067 --> 03:24.238
Teresa is gonna help me
set up distribution.

03:24.272 --> 03:26.440
*

03:26.474 --> 03:28.075
GUERO: I can't stay here.

03:28.108 --> 03:31.078
Not in Dallas.
She wanted me dead, Teresa.

03:31.111 --> 03:32.913
That was before Bolivia.

03:32.946 --> 03:35.549
She's happy with
what we've done.

03:35.583 --> 03:37.351
No, she's happy with you.

03:37.385 --> 03:39.186
(distant train horn blows)

03:39.219 --> 03:41.188
I'm gonna talk to her.

03:41.221 --> 03:42.890
GUERO: No one's safe
with Camila.

03:42.923 --> 03:45.526
Everybody's expendable.
You can't see that?

03:45.559 --> 03:47.661
(gate opens)

03:49.797 --> 03:51.799
Come on.
We got work to do.

03:57.070 --> 03:59.072
(truck door opens)

04:05.913 --> 04:07.415
(engine turns over)

04:09.950 --> 04:12.720
(phone line trilling)

04:12.753 --> 04:14.655
CAMILA: Epifanio.

04:14.688 --> 04:17.558
Isabela received a necklace
with El Santo's logo on it.

04:17.591 --> 04:20.761
Now, she has no clue
what it is, but we do.

04:20.794 --> 04:23.797
Why is El Santo threatening
our daughter, Camila?

04:23.831 --> 04:26.767
El Santo's my new supplier now.

04:26.800 --> 04:29.803
I have a payment
due to him in a week,

04:29.837 --> 04:31.472
so I guess the necklace
is a reminder.

04:31.505 --> 04:33.907
(speaking Spanish)

04:33.941 --> 04:36.176
You went into business
with this religious lunatic?

04:36.209 --> 04:38.446
You destroyed everyone
I did business with

04:38.479 --> 04:40.147
then left me nearly
with nothing.

04:40.180 --> 04:42.182
You really think I was
not going to rebuild?

04:42.215 --> 04:43.984
She's our child, Camila.

04:46.119 --> 04:49.690
Listen, how much
is the payment to this man?

04:49.723 --> 04:52.593
$3 million.

04:52.626 --> 04:53.827
(sighs)

04:53.861 --> 04:57.164
*

04:57.197 --> 04:58.832
Listen, I'm gonna get the cash

04:58.866 --> 05:00.634
to cover your first payment.

05:00.668 --> 05:02.470
Then I'm gonna take
the coke you got from them,

05:02.503 --> 05:06.340
move it myself, and pay off
that psychotic zealot.

05:06.374 --> 05:09.610
And you are finished
in this business forever.

05:09.643 --> 05:13.280
You know by now how well
I respond to threats, mi amore.

05:13.313 --> 05:15.115
You don't get to tell me
how I earn.

05:15.148 --> 05:16.617
EPIFANIO: When your earning

05:16.650 --> 05:18.151
threatens the life
of my daughter,

05:18.185 --> 05:20.354
you're God damn right I do.

05:20.388 --> 05:23.123
And if you think
my threat is empty,

05:23.156 --> 05:26.126
well, you just fucking try me,
mi amore.

05:26.159 --> 05:27.127
(phone beeps)

05:27.160 --> 05:29.162
*

05:30.731 --> 05:33.033
So then you get the guns
and you have to kill

05:33.066 --> 05:35.569
all the alien bad guys
to save the galactic princess.

05:35.603 --> 05:37.971
That sounds violent.

05:38.005 --> 05:40.974
Maybe that wasn't a good game
I gave you.

05:41.008 --> 05:42.710
No way!
It's awesome.

05:42.743 --> 05:44.077
All my friends at my new school
wanna play it.

05:44.111 --> 05:46.980
I'm glad.
Listen, I have to go.

05:47.014 --> 05:48.649
I love you, okay?

05:48.682 --> 05:50.350
Don't let those
bad guys get you.

05:50.384 --> 05:53.821
I won't.
Bye, Teresa.

05:53.854 --> 05:54.955
(phone beeps)

06:14.374 --> 06:16.176
Thank you.

06:16.209 --> 06:17.578
Salud.

06:19.947 --> 06:24.718
*

06:24.752 --> 06:28.288
This is probably the best thing
I've ever tasted in my life.

06:28.321 --> 06:32.025
Well, at $2,000 a bottle,
it should be.

06:32.059 --> 06:33.226
(speaking Spanish)

06:33.260 --> 06:38.432
*

06:38.466 --> 06:41.201
I remember that first time
Epifanio and I

06:41.234 --> 06:44.071
could afford a bottle like this.

06:44.104 --> 06:47.040
You think it's a better drink.

06:47.074 --> 06:50.978
But then you realize,
it's a better life.

06:51.011 --> 06:56.149
*

06:56.183 --> 06:59.386
Epifanio's distributors are ripe
to be lured back in

06:59.419 --> 07:01.989
for two reasons.

07:02.022 --> 07:04.725
First, we have
a superior product.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.994
CAMILA: It's what coke was
in the '80s.

07:07.027 --> 07:10.330
No adulterants,
incredible euphoria,

07:10.363 --> 07:12.766
absolutely no come down.

07:12.800 --> 07:14.434
-And second--
-They can't get product

07:14.468 --> 07:18.739
because we blew up
Epifanio's tunnel.

07:18.772 --> 07:19.840
Good.

07:19.873 --> 07:21.809
*

07:21.842 --> 07:23.477
I've set up a meeting with a man

07:23.511 --> 07:26.446
that controls the largest region
in the Southwest.

07:26.480 --> 07:28.281
Ki-Moon Kim.

07:28.315 --> 07:31.284
He distributes northern Arizona
to Houston.

07:31.318 --> 07:32.953
400 kilos a week.

07:32.986 --> 07:35.088
He looks like
a kindly grandfather,

07:35.122 --> 07:36.924
but don't let that fool you.

07:36.957 --> 07:38.291
*

07:38.325 --> 07:40.460
He came up in the Korean mob,

07:40.494 --> 07:42.530
deadly and ruthless.

07:42.563 --> 07:46.033
*

07:46.066 --> 07:50.037
This is how you turn
$1 million a month

07:50.070 --> 07:52.673
into $5 million a week,

07:52.706 --> 07:54.274
if we succeed.

07:54.307 --> 07:56.944
And Teresa...

07:56.977 --> 07:58.478
we will succeed.

07:58.512 --> 08:01.214
*

08:10.658 --> 08:13.861
EPIFANIO: I need 3 million cash,
and I need it immediately.

08:13.894 --> 08:16.897
(both speaking Spanish)

08:17.898 --> 08:21.735
(phone beeps, line trills)

08:21.769 --> 08:24.071
ISABELA: (speaking Spanish)
(line beeps)

08:24.104 --> 08:27.741
(speaking Spanish)

08:27.775 --> 08:30.544
This is your father.
(lifts, drops receiver)

08:30.578 --> 08:31.979
Does she think that
I don't know she's with

08:32.012 --> 08:33.914
that pinche Kique Jimenez?

08:33.947 --> 08:36.650
You have more pressing
family issues.

08:36.684 --> 08:39.419
We just received word
from our Dallas distributors:

08:39.452 --> 08:42.656
Camila is trying
to steal them back.

08:42.690 --> 08:44.892
She's got meetings
set up already.

08:44.925 --> 08:49.329
One is with our Southwest U.S.
distributors, Ki-Moon.

08:49.362 --> 08:52.365
I offered to pull her
out of the fire with El Santo

08:52.399 --> 08:54.602
with my money,
and she does this.

08:54.635 --> 08:56.069
(chuckles)

08:56.103 --> 08:59.573
(speaking Spanish)

08:59.607 --> 09:02.542
Anyone who meets with her is
declaring their betrayal to me.

09:02.576 --> 09:05.178
It should be
dealt with accordingly.

09:05.212 --> 09:06.914
She's just going
to keep going.

09:06.947 --> 09:10.684
Your wife put your daughter
in danger.

09:10.718 --> 09:14.521
Compa, isn't it time

09:14.554 --> 09:18.892
that we put an end
to her right now?

09:18.926 --> 09:20.360
(dark music)

09:20.393 --> 09:22.195
No.

09:22.229 --> 09:25.098
Do what you gotta do
to stop Camila's business.

09:25.132 --> 09:27.868
But don't touch my wife.

09:27.901 --> 09:29.970
Is that understood?

09:30.003 --> 09:31.772
Claro, compa.

09:31.805 --> 09:34.041
*

09:34.074 --> 09:35.408
Claro.

09:39.613 --> 09:42.049
(speaking Korean)

09:42.082 --> 09:43.651
She is respectful.

09:43.684 --> 09:45.085
She is.

09:47.788 --> 09:51.992
So the merchandise is of
the highest quality, Mr. Kim.

09:52.025 --> 09:54.261
And unlike Epifanio's product,

09:54.294 --> 09:57.731
it can be delivered
to you today.

09:57.765 --> 10:00.300
I was assured that Epifanio's
delivery issue

10:00.333 --> 10:02.102
will resolve itself shortly.

10:02.135 --> 10:04.738
No, his delay's costing you
millions of dollars.

10:04.772 --> 10:08.842
And he's charging you
30,000 a kilo.

10:08.876 --> 10:12.279
You can get ours today
at 25,000.

10:12.312 --> 10:13.981
You'd be getting
a better product

10:14.014 --> 10:16.516
for half a million dollars less.

10:16.549 --> 10:20.688
And at what price does loyalty
become for sale?

10:23.657 --> 10:25.425
All this talk about money.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.594
I apologize profusely.

10:27.627 --> 10:30.764
Teresa's young.
I have high hopes for her.

10:30.798 --> 10:34.301
It's difficult to teach this
business to those whom you love.

10:34.334 --> 10:38.271
My own son, Ki-Wan...
(laughs) (speaks Korean)

10:38.305 --> 10:39.940
My wife and I worry.

10:39.973 --> 10:43.376
Well, you're fortunate to have
the relationship

10:43.410 --> 10:45.979
you have with your son.

10:46.013 --> 10:47.715
I'm ashamed to admit
that Epifanio

10:47.748 --> 10:51.985
is attempting to separate me
from my own daughter.

10:52.019 --> 10:54.154
Sung-Shil will be saddened
to hear.

10:54.187 --> 10:57.725
In the midst of your own
family turmoil,

10:57.758 --> 11:00.127
you invite into your home.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.796
-I am honored.
-And I am honored to know

11:02.830 --> 11:05.465
that even if you came
to say no to me,

11:05.498 --> 11:09.469
you're still open enough
to bring your taster.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.571
His palate is without question.

11:11.604 --> 11:16.143
And I'm sure he'll find
our product unlike anything

11:16.176 --> 11:18.011
you can find available anywhere.

11:27.855 --> 11:34.828
*

11:34.862 --> 11:39.232
For Epifanio,
you're a number on his ledger.

11:39.266 --> 11:42.002
To me, you're family.

11:42.035 --> 11:43.904
And I will protect you and yours

11:43.937 --> 11:46.239
like I protect my own.

11:46.273 --> 11:53.280
*

11:55.749 --> 11:58.752
(all speaking Korean)

12:05.893 --> 12:08.461
(indistinct chatter)

12:08.495 --> 12:10.463
Well, looks like we're in charge
of some high-level shit here.

12:10.497 --> 12:12.332
You get promoted?

12:14.734 --> 12:16.436
You should.

12:16.469 --> 12:19.807
I mean, you did do everything
Camila asked you to.

12:19.840 --> 12:23.743
Almost everything,
anyways.

12:23.777 --> 12:25.212
You trying to make me
regret that?

12:25.245 --> 12:27.280
I don't know, man.
I'm grateful.

12:27.314 --> 12:31.451
I just--I don't know
if Camila feels the same way.

12:31.484 --> 12:33.120
La Paz was one thing.

12:33.153 --> 12:36.156
You're gonna have to
prove yourself in Dallas.

12:36.189 --> 12:37.991
You're gonna meet
a guy--Delaney.

12:38.025 --> 12:40.994
He's gonna sell you
some equipment we need.

12:41.028 --> 12:42.595
Why me?

12:42.629 --> 12:45.065
If Camila knew I let a snitch
watch her stash,

12:45.098 --> 12:46.934
she'd kill us both.

12:46.967 --> 12:49.002
Take the truck out front.

12:51.171 --> 12:53.907
Watch yourself.

12:53.941 --> 12:56.443
Will do.

12:56.476 --> 12:58.912
CAMILA: After the little stunt
Epifanio pulled on us,

12:58.946 --> 13:00.814
I need to send a message.

13:00.848 --> 13:02.582
Well, I'll do what I can,

13:02.615 --> 13:04.918
but I don't usually handle
divorce settlements.

13:04.952 --> 13:08.088
Well, I don't trust anybody else
digging about my business.

13:08.121 --> 13:10.323
Can I count on you
to protect my interests?

13:10.357 --> 13:14.327
That you can.
Absolutely.

13:14.361 --> 13:17.697
(indistinct chatter)

13:17.730 --> 13:19.599
Can we continue this later?

13:19.632 --> 13:22.269
- Same room, same time?
-I'll be there.

13:22.302 --> 13:23.803
Not to talk business, though.

13:23.837 --> 13:30.844
*

13:31.979 --> 13:34.781
Devon, thank you
so much for coming.

13:34.814 --> 13:37.784
(indistinct chatter)

13:37.817 --> 13:42.622
*

13:42.655 --> 13:45.125
From here on out,
you'll be reporting to me.

13:45.158 --> 13:47.627
With his injury sustained
in the raid on the trawler,

13:47.660 --> 13:50.063
it's unclear when
Agent Finnerman will return.

13:50.097 --> 13:51.831
Or if.

13:53.867 --> 14:00.473
*

14:00.507 --> 14:03.643
It is important work
that Garrett was doing.

14:03.676 --> 14:07.680
The best way we can honor him
is to finish that work.

14:07.714 --> 14:10.884
Which is why I'm assigning you
as the head of this task force.

14:12.519 --> 14:14.254
It'd be my honor.

14:14.287 --> 14:16.156
The U.S. Attorney's Office
wants us to focus our efforts

14:16.189 --> 14:18.691
on the trawler company
that transported the cocaine

14:18.725 --> 14:20.593
seized at the docks.

14:20.627 --> 14:23.430
U.S. Attorney Christopher will
be working in-house on the case.

14:23.463 --> 14:27.167
It could be a smoking gun if
we can tie it to Camila Vargas.

14:27.200 --> 14:30.603
Any ideas where you're gonna
focus your efforts?

14:30.637 --> 14:33.406
*

14:33.440 --> 14:35.875
ALONZO: Outside of putting a
bullet in Guero D'Avila's head?

14:35.909 --> 14:37.677
*

14:37.710 --> 14:39.512
Yeah, I think I know
where I'll start.

14:39.546 --> 14:42.515
*

14:42.549 --> 14:44.717
*

14:52.759 --> 14:55.362
My husband's an attorney.

14:55.395 --> 14:57.730
He works will all different
kinds of people.

14:57.764 --> 14:58.932
In the penthouse suite
at a Ritz

14:58.966 --> 15:01.101
while ordering room service?

15:04.004 --> 15:05.973
Camila Vargas runs
a major drug cartel,

15:06.006 --> 15:08.475
with operations in Mexico
and Texas.

15:08.508 --> 15:12.545
They're responsible for the
murder of hundreds of people.

15:12.579 --> 15:15.615
(dark music)

15:15.648 --> 15:17.417
*

15:17.450 --> 15:19.219
Oh, Christ.

15:19.252 --> 15:20.920
*

15:20.954 --> 15:23.123
Including three agents
from this office.

15:23.156 --> 15:24.724
*

15:24.757 --> 15:28.228
Jesus.

15:28.261 --> 15:31.598
Camila orders people killed
like she orders breakfast.

15:31.631 --> 15:33.900
*

15:33.933 --> 15:36.236
Now, like it or not,
your husband's put

15:36.269 --> 15:40.607
your life at risk by choosing
to be involved with her.

15:40.640 --> 15:42.509
We need your help to stop her.

15:42.542 --> 15:45.278
*

15:45.312 --> 15:48.615
My husband doesn't talk to me.

15:48.648 --> 15:51.985
He doesn't tell me anything.
He's a safe.

15:52.019 --> 15:54.321
And when we do talk,
it isn't about work.

15:54.354 --> 15:58.992
*

15:59.026 --> 16:00.793
How about these people?

16:00.827 --> 16:06.766
*

16:06.799 --> 16:08.935
You seen any of them
around Cole?

16:08.968 --> 16:15.942
*

16:15.975 --> 16:17.944
No.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.812
*

16:19.846 --> 16:22.849
No, I've never seen
those people before in my life.

16:22.882 --> 16:26.219
*

16:26.253 --> 16:29.089
(lighter flicking)

16:30.490 --> 16:32.159
Gracias.

16:38.098 --> 16:40.667
You know, family is everything
to Ki-Moon.

16:40.700 --> 16:43.636
I knew you were gonna
use money to lure him in.

16:43.670 --> 16:46.706
And I knew what
his reaction would be.

16:46.739 --> 16:50.043
So when you stepped in,
he saw himself in his son.

16:50.077 --> 16:52.545
Family is his weakness.

16:52.579 --> 16:55.215
He took the bait
and we've got him on board.

16:55.248 --> 16:58.485
But Ki-Moon's distribution
isn't enough.

16:58.518 --> 17:02.255
Now, this is Miguelangelo.
Like the painter,

17:02.289 --> 17:04.991
you know this man has
a passion for art.

17:05.024 --> 17:08.728
And a severe case of
obsessive compulsive disorder.

17:08.761 --> 17:11.531
He is the Howard Hughes
of cocaine.

17:11.564 --> 17:14.534
He doesn't allow any of his men
to touch him

17:14.567 --> 17:15.935
or to shake his hand.

17:15.968 --> 17:18.505
He forbids it

17:18.538 --> 17:21.108
because of the germs.

17:21.141 --> 17:24.344
Not everybody can deal
with his OCD.

17:24.377 --> 17:28.348
Never go into business
with someone

17:28.381 --> 17:32.352
unless you know
what their weakness is.

17:32.385 --> 17:33.786
What's mine?

17:37.324 --> 17:39.559
Guero.

17:39.592 --> 17:42.395
That's why you asked James
to kill him in Bolivia?

17:42.429 --> 17:45.698
*

17:45.732 --> 17:48.535
He's a snitch, Teresa.

17:48.568 --> 17:51.804
It doesn't matter how many times
he bats his blue eyes at you.

17:51.838 --> 17:54.774
He can't be trusted.

17:54.807 --> 17:58.077
I've given you my loyalty.

17:58.111 --> 18:01.148
You don't have to kill him.

18:01.181 --> 18:03.583
I don't have to consult you

18:03.616 --> 18:05.785
or anybody else
on these matters.

18:05.818 --> 18:08.255
*

18:08.288 --> 18:10.557
You know, Guero,
he still sees you

18:10.590 --> 18:14.794
as a morra on his arm.

18:14.827 --> 18:17.797
He doesn't see what I see.

18:17.830 --> 18:21.468
If you want to succeed
as a businesswoman, Teresa,

18:21.501 --> 18:24.904
you have to learn
to control your weaknesses...

18:24.937 --> 18:28.741
before somebody else
exploits them

18:28.775 --> 18:30.743
and it costs you your life.

18:30.777 --> 18:33.079
*

18:33.112 --> 18:34.281
Salud.

18:35.848 --> 18:37.517
Salud.

18:37.550 --> 18:44.524
*

18:44.557 --> 18:47.594
This baby right here is like
your invisibility cloak.

18:47.627 --> 18:48.928
Like in "Harry Potter,"
right?

18:48.961 --> 18:50.463
Now, it connects
to any cell tower

18:50.497 --> 18:51.664
within a mile of the radius.

18:51.698 --> 18:52.865
It makes your cellular and data

18:52.899 --> 18:54.601
web communications untraceable.

18:54.634 --> 18:56.169
So you can talk
all your crazy gangster shit

18:56.203 --> 18:58.037
with your crazy
gangster friends,

18:58.070 --> 18:59.672
and motherfreaking Columbo

18:59.706 --> 19:01.140
could be right outside
your door.

19:01.174 --> 19:02.609
He'd be like,
"Listen to them nice boys

19:02.642 --> 19:04.010
talking about they moms
and shit."

19:04.043 --> 19:05.678
-Nice.
-I also got some

19:05.712 --> 19:07.847
primo police scanners on.

19:07.880 --> 19:09.316
Little bit of everything.

19:09.349 --> 19:10.383
Just depends on what
you're looking for.

19:10.417 --> 19:11.651
All right, yeah, man.

19:11.684 --> 19:13.353
Um, yeah, gimme four of these

19:13.386 --> 19:14.954
-and six of the scanners.
-You a wise man, dude.

19:14.987 --> 19:17.690
You a wise man.
Uh, P.S.,

19:17.724 --> 19:19.526
got a little side hustle
if you hungry.

19:19.559 --> 19:21.127
Got a little white girl
burning a hole in my pocket

19:21.160 --> 19:23.296
looking for a party, man.

19:23.330 --> 19:25.965
(hip-hop music playing)

19:25.998 --> 19:28.735
Thanks, man.
I think we're good on coke.

19:28.768 --> 19:31.771
(police radio chatter)

19:33.740 --> 19:39.379
*

19:39.412 --> 19:40.980
Shit.

19:41.013 --> 19:47.687
*

19:47.720 --> 19:50.723
(beeping)

19:51.758 --> 19:56.229
*

19:56.263 --> 19:57.897
(van engine turns over)

19:57.930 --> 20:00.333
(police radio chatter)

20:00.367 --> 20:02.335
Alpha 33 to five,
I need all additional units

20:02.369 --> 20:03.703
to Hickory and Pearl Stone.

20:03.736 --> 20:05.071
Fugitive fleeing on foot.

20:05.104 --> 20:06.072
(police radio chatter)

20:06.105 --> 20:08.341
(siren wailing)

20:08.375 --> 20:10.377
(cell phone buzzes, beeps)

20:10.410 --> 20:12.078
Hello?

20:12.111 --> 20:14.581
Oh, how's my favorite
executive consultant?

20:14.614 --> 20:16.516
KELLY ANNE: This is
Kelly Anne Van Auken.

20:16.549 --> 20:18.385
We met at the benefit party
a while back.

20:18.418 --> 20:20.086
Yeah, hi.
How are you?

20:20.119 --> 20:23.055
Oh, ha.
Well, I'm just living the dream.

20:23.089 --> 20:25.458
Listen, um, I'm having a few
girls over tomorrow night

20:25.492 --> 20:26.759
for a little wine tasting party.

20:26.793 --> 20:28.227
KELLY ANNE: Could you join us?

20:28.261 --> 20:29.862
I know this is kinda random.

20:29.896 --> 20:33.300
No, thank you for inviting me.

20:33.333 --> 20:36.068
Well, I'll text you the address
just in case you can make it.

20:36.102 --> 20:37.770
And I hope
this wasn't too weird.

20:37.804 --> 20:40.139
Not at all.
I'll see you then.

20:40.172 --> 20:41.708
Okay.
(chuckles)

20:41.741 --> 20:44.076
-Bye, darling.
-Bye.

20:44.110 --> 20:45.912
(phone beeps)

20:45.945 --> 20:48.448
Cole's wife just invited me
to a wine tasting.

20:48.481 --> 20:51.217
I've met her once.
Why would she call me?

20:51.250 --> 20:53.219
She must have a reason.

20:53.252 --> 20:55.154
That woman has a mouth
like a faucet,

20:55.187 --> 20:57.424
but she's married to
our attorney, so just go.

20:57.457 --> 20:59.559
Keep her close.

20:59.592 --> 21:03.430
(cell phone buzzes)

21:03.463 --> 21:05.998
It's her again.

21:06.032 --> 21:07.400
(phone buzzes, beeps)

21:07.434 --> 21:08.335
Yeah?

21:08.368 --> 21:09.336
(siren wailing)

21:09.369 --> 21:11.103
Babe, hey.

21:11.137 --> 21:13.172
I need you, I'm--
I'm a few miles from the house.

21:13.205 --> 21:15.074
GUERO: I'll drop you a pin,
okay?

21:15.107 --> 21:17.977
(sirens wailing)

21:18.010 --> 21:22.749
*

21:22.782 --> 21:25.785
(helicopter whirring)

21:27.654 --> 21:34.527
*

21:40.400 --> 21:41.901
(tires screech)

21:44.637 --> 21:47.006
They didn't see me yet.
Hurry.

21:47.039 --> 21:49.842
(tires screeching)

21:49.876 --> 21:52.545
*

21:52.579 --> 21:53.813
GUERO: How bad is it?
TERESA: There are cops

21:53.846 --> 21:56.148
everywhere.

21:56.182 --> 21:58.385
We're going to get out, okay?

21:58.418 --> 22:00.720
*

22:00.753 --> 22:02.955
(tires screeching)

22:02.989 --> 22:04.991
(siren wailing)
TERESA: Oh, shit.

22:05.024 --> 22:06.993
Get down.
Get down!

22:07.026 --> 22:10.062
(siren wailing)

22:11.698 --> 22:18.705
*

22:24.010 --> 22:25.445
(siren fading)

22:33.620 --> 22:36.389
TERESA:
The police are closing in.

22:36.423 --> 22:38.658
This is exactly what
I was afraid of.

22:38.691 --> 22:41.060
This is bad.

22:41.093 --> 22:43.329
Hey.

22:43.362 --> 22:44.897
(speaking Spanish)

22:44.931 --> 22:47.066
If Camila finds out--
I'm supposed to meet her

22:47.099 --> 22:48.167
at the gallery right now.

22:48.200 --> 22:50.002
We'll deal with it.

22:50.036 --> 22:52.004
There's no dealing
with Camila, you know that.

22:52.038 --> 22:53.840
(distant siren wails)

22:53.873 --> 22:56.008
TERESA: You need to
leave Dallas.

22:56.042 --> 22:57.744
Teresa, listen to me.

22:57.777 --> 22:59.345
We went to Bolivia.
You got her a new supplier

22:59.378 --> 23:00.547
with my connect, all right?

23:00.580 --> 23:02.014
Camila, she might be cruel,

23:02.048 --> 23:04.216
but she's a businesswoman first.

23:04.250 --> 23:06.553
She needs us,
and she knows that.

23:06.586 --> 23:08.788
But the DEA--
you're a fugitive.

23:10.457 --> 23:15.361
Look, anywhere I go, I'm gonna
be in their crosshairs.

23:15.394 --> 23:19.566
So...if it's all gonna
end tonight,

23:19.599 --> 23:22.268
there's no place I'd rather be
than right here with you.

23:25.171 --> 23:26.405
Come here.

23:31.778 --> 23:33.746
(car door opens, closes)

23:33.780 --> 23:36.783
(chickens clucking,
horse neighing)

23:42.489 --> 23:46.058
So, you kidnapped me
to come all the way to el campo.

23:46.092 --> 23:48.060
What are we doing here?

23:48.094 --> 23:50.396
I wanted us to have
a chance to talk.

23:50.429 --> 23:54.433
Here? Why?

23:54.467 --> 23:57.937
No father loves when his
daughter starts dating boys.

23:57.970 --> 24:01.073
But Kique Jimenez
is not any boy.

24:01.107 --> 24:02.642
He's unacceptable.

24:02.675 --> 24:04.977
'Cause he's
a cartel leader's son?

24:05.011 --> 24:06.813
I'm a cartel leader's daughter.

24:06.846 --> 24:10.316
And please, don't le and tell me
you're just Governor now.

24:10.349 --> 24:12.752
I heard that song.

24:12.785 --> 24:15.087
That song doesn't
tell everything.

24:15.121 --> 24:17.356
You never met your grandparents.

24:17.389 --> 24:18.925
They were proud farmers.

24:18.958 --> 24:22.595
And this was their farm.

24:22.629 --> 24:24.263
EPIFANIO:
This is where I grew up.

24:24.296 --> 24:27.266
(light acoustic music)

24:27.299 --> 24:32.204
*

24:32.238 --> 24:33.540
(chuckles)

24:33.573 --> 24:35.808
*

24:35.842 --> 24:38.778
In Culiacán, all the farmers
had to pay protection

24:38.811 --> 24:41.380
from a local gangster.

24:41.413 --> 24:47.286
*

24:47.319 --> 24:50.056
(both speaking Spanish)

24:50.089 --> 24:51.891
*

24:51.924 --> 24:54.627
Epi...
(speaking Spanish)

24:54.661 --> 24:59.498
*

24:59.532 --> 25:02.168
EPIFANIO:
They called him El Crocodilo.

25:02.201 --> 25:08.474
*

25:08.507 --> 25:11.510
(both speaking Spanish)

25:12.679 --> 25:14.914
EPIFANIO:
My father struggled to pay him.

25:15.915 --> 25:18.918
(both speaking Spanish)

25:21.220 --> 25:22.555
No, Epi, no...

25:22.589 --> 25:25.558
(men grunting)

25:25.592 --> 25:27.259
Ah! Ah!

25:27.293 --> 25:28.527
Epi, Epi, no.

25:28.561 --> 25:30.162
When my parents were short one

25:30.196 --> 25:31.564
time too many...

25:31.598 --> 25:38.571
*

25:38.605 --> 25:41.373
He hanged my mother
and my father...

25:41.407 --> 25:44.010
*

25:44.043 --> 25:47.379
From this tree.

25:47.413 --> 25:49.381
I found them like that.

25:49.415 --> 25:51.851
*

25:51.884 --> 25:53.085
Then I grew up.

25:53.119 --> 25:54.754
I married your mother.

25:54.787 --> 25:57.123
And for the first time
since I lost my parents,

25:57.156 --> 25:59.626
I didn't feel alone.

25:59.659 --> 26:01.728
I took over the farm.

26:01.761 --> 26:04.030
And when the Crocodile
came around

26:04.063 --> 26:05.632
to collect his money,

26:05.665 --> 26:08.034
I had to beg for the life
of my family.

26:08.067 --> 26:10.536
The only reason he spared them
was because I agreed

26:10.569 --> 26:13.606
to grow marijuana on our farm.

26:13.640 --> 26:16.609
Whatever happened
to the Crocodile?

26:16.643 --> 26:23.650
*

26:26.418 --> 26:28.688
The Federales ran him
out of the country.

26:33.926 --> 26:36.896
I got into this life

26:36.929 --> 26:38.130
so you wouldn't
have to come home

26:38.164 --> 26:39.598
and see your mother and father

26:39.632 --> 26:42.769
hanging from a tree.

26:42.802 --> 26:44.436
I had no choice.

26:44.470 --> 26:46.105
You do.

26:46.138 --> 26:48.808
So why are you choosing
Kique Jimenez?

26:51.143 --> 26:54.413
Ever since I found out
what you and Mom do,

26:54.446 --> 26:56.448
I'm scared all the time.

26:56.482 --> 26:59.251
Kique's the only one
who understands.

26:59.285 --> 27:02.521
He makes me feel safe.

27:02.554 --> 27:04.256
I'm not gonna stop seeing him.

27:04.290 --> 27:05.557
Isabela...

27:07.960 --> 27:11.397
Your business is my Crocodile.

27:15.067 --> 27:16.736
(car door opens)

27:17.804 --> 27:20.807
(phone buzzing)

27:22.709 --> 27:24.443
(car door shuts)

27:24.476 --> 27:26.779
Forgive the intrusion.
I hope I didn't disturb

27:26.813 --> 27:28.280
your family business.

27:28.314 --> 27:29.782
Is everything in place?

27:29.816 --> 27:30.850
CORTEZ: Si, Governador.

27:30.883 --> 27:34.520
It's being taken care of.

27:34.553 --> 27:37.790
Yes?
We'll speak in the morning.

27:37.824 --> 27:39.158
(phone beeps)

27:39.191 --> 27:41.894
(dark music)

27:41.928 --> 27:44.530
(gunshots)
(men groaning)

27:44.563 --> 27:46.799
(gunshot)

27:46.833 --> 27:48.500
William!

27:48.534 --> 27:51.370
(struggling)

27:51.403 --> 27:54.340
BETO: Camila will not be doing
business with Ki-Moon

27:54.373 --> 27:56.475
or any of
our other distributors.

27:56.508 --> 27:57.744
Excellent.

27:57.777 --> 28:00.713
EPIFANIO:
(speaking Spanish)

28:00.747 --> 28:06.252
*

28:06.285 --> 28:10.556
Camila Vargas. Octavio Rentas,
Miguelangelo's associate.

28:10.589 --> 28:13.425
Please, have a seat.

28:13.459 --> 28:15.928
He's just finishing up
some business

28:15.962 --> 28:18.697
and he apologizes profusely
for being so late.

28:18.731 --> 28:21.667
Well, considering how much
he values punctuality,

28:21.700 --> 28:22.935
I don't doubt it.

28:22.969 --> 28:25.237
(speaking Spanish)

28:25.271 --> 28:29.175
So, a thousand kilos
of Bolivian product.

28:29.208 --> 28:32.178
That has to be refrigerated
to keep its high quality, no?

28:32.211 --> 28:34.580
-Yes, of course--
-I'm sorry to interrupt.

28:34.613 --> 28:38.017
I haven't introduced myself.

28:38.050 --> 28:39.118
Teresa Mendoza.

28:39.151 --> 28:40.252
Octavio.

28:40.286 --> 28:42.354
(both speaking Spanish)

28:42.388 --> 28:44.356
Before we discuss business,

28:44.390 --> 28:48.861
Camila always likes
to make a toast.

28:48.895 --> 28:51.563
Well, I wouldn't want
to get in the way of tradition.

28:51.597 --> 28:53.299
both: Good.

28:56.068 --> 28:58.971
(cell phone ringing)
Excuse me one moment.

28:59.005 --> 29:01.407
*

29:01.440 --> 29:03.542
CAMILA: He shook your hand.

29:03.575 --> 29:04.643
TERESA: I don't know who he is,
but he doesn't

29:04.676 --> 29:05.778
work for Miguelangelo.

29:05.812 --> 29:09.115
(speaking Spanish)

29:13.685 --> 29:16.688
(speaking Spanish)

29:19.758 --> 29:21.560
(suspenseful music)

29:21.593 --> 29:22.561
(phone beeps)

29:22.594 --> 29:28.100
*

29:28.134 --> 29:29.168
Go, now.

29:29.201 --> 29:36.208
*

29:42.348 --> 29:44.750
CAMILA: Devon Finch.

29:44.783 --> 29:47.519
COLE: I thought
we weren't talking work.

29:47.553 --> 29:50.589
All right, fine.
Devon Finch is a businessman.

29:50.622 --> 29:53.826
Right, understatement.
He has diversified holdings

29:53.860 --> 29:55.494
all over the world.

29:55.527 --> 29:58.797
Real estate, stocks and bonds,
boutique hotels.

29:58.831 --> 30:00.166
What, are you looking
to make an investment?

30:00.199 --> 30:02.268
Maybe we should take a tour.
(laughs)

30:02.301 --> 30:04.636
He keeps 10%
of the rooms empty,

30:04.670 --> 30:07.273
even though they appeared
as booked on paper.

30:07.306 --> 30:11.110
10% of 5,000 rooms
that run $100 a night.

30:11.143 --> 30:15.447
365 days in a year.
That's around $18 million.

30:15.481 --> 30:19.118
And he still has his
private-Uber-for-jets business.

30:19.151 --> 30:20.686
(dark music)

30:20.719 --> 30:21.888
No, Cole.

30:24.323 --> 30:28.360
I'm not interested in investing
in Finch's companies.

30:28.394 --> 30:30.029
I'm interested in distribution

30:30.062 --> 30:31.797
and money laundering
through them.

30:31.830 --> 30:35.201
Well, before Devon will
meet anybody new,

30:35.234 --> 30:39.138
he requires a $250,000 donation
to his charity.

30:39.171 --> 30:41.807
And there's absolutely
no guarantee he'll say yes.

30:41.840 --> 30:43.910
$250,000 for a meeting?

30:43.943 --> 30:47.746
Devon Finch gets
a hundred offers a day.

30:47.779 --> 30:49.181
He accepts one.

30:49.215 --> 30:51.483
You willing to gamble
with those odds?

30:51.517 --> 30:55.354
The bet's on me?
Yes.

30:55.387 --> 30:58.824
COLE: Hello. Oh.
(laughs)

30:58.857 --> 31:01.327
EPIFANIO:
Camila destroyed our tunnels.

31:01.360 --> 31:03.996
BETO: That's fine.
Let her hide in the dirt.

31:04.030 --> 31:05.965
We will own the air above it.

31:10.436 --> 31:12.738
Each of these will carry
ten kilos.

31:12.771 --> 31:15.041
We'll jam
the Homeland Security GPS

31:15.074 --> 31:18.210
and then fly ten of them
over the border every day.

31:18.244 --> 31:20.279
*

31:20.312 --> 31:23.315
(speaking Spanish)

31:27.619 --> 31:30.289
CORTEZ: We still have Camila
to deal with.

31:30.322 --> 31:32.224
EPIFANIO: I have a call into
the U.S. Attorney.

31:32.258 --> 31:35.061
We'll let the DEA handle her.

31:35.094 --> 31:37.930
I spoke with General Macintosh--
our Drug Czar--

31:37.964 --> 31:41.100
and, well, he isn't sure
how the U.S. will benefit

31:41.133 --> 31:44.436
from a joint Texas-Sinaloa
task force.

31:44.470 --> 31:46.538
Well, I'm sure he's aware
of the successful strikes

31:46.572 --> 31:49.041
I've ordered against
the cartel in my state.

31:49.075 --> 31:51.077
CHRISTOPHER: He is.
And he's also aware

31:51.110 --> 31:53.045
of the rumors
swirling around you

31:53.079 --> 31:55.081
and your own involvement
in the cartel.

31:55.114 --> 31:57.283
Let's not act as if
the United States

31:57.316 --> 31:59.051
has never worked with
men with a past.

31:59.085 --> 32:01.954
I'm not proud of it,
but as a youth in Sinaloa,

32:01.988 --> 32:04.223
I did what was necessary
to survive.

32:04.256 --> 32:05.724
And now I'm doing
what's necessary

32:05.757 --> 32:07.393
for the survival of my people.

32:07.426 --> 32:09.495
Dallas PD. Five bodies down.
It looks like cartel.

32:09.528 --> 32:10.596
-Go.
EPIFANIO: Your country's been

32:10.629 --> 32:11.998
spared the violence

32:12.031 --> 32:13.465
and the bloodshed
we have endured

32:13.499 --> 32:15.167
as a direct result
of living next to

32:15.201 --> 32:17.403
the world's greatest consumer
of narcotics.

32:17.436 --> 32:20.106
EPIFANIO: Now,
you may build a wall,

32:20.139 --> 32:22.908
but the violence
you see in Mexico,

32:22.941 --> 32:24.043
it's coming.

32:25.944 --> 32:27.846
Is that a threat, Governor?

32:27.879 --> 32:31.750
It's a cautionary warning
from a friend, Mr. Black.

32:31.783 --> 32:33.919
We have a common problem.

32:33.952 --> 32:35.921
And I'm offering you a solution.

32:35.954 --> 32:37.756
EPIFANIO: Think it over.

32:37.789 --> 32:39.158
*

32:39.191 --> 32:40.592
(phone beeps)

32:40.626 --> 32:42.361
(chuckles)

32:42.394 --> 32:44.330
FEMALE ANCHOR: In a series
of gangland killings,

32:44.363 --> 32:46.098
the brutality and carnage of
which authorities are saying

32:46.132 --> 32:48.800
is unprecedented
in the Dallas area.

32:48.834 --> 32:50.336
I must warn you:
the following images

32:50.369 --> 32:52.038
are very graphic.

32:52.071 --> 32:54.940
Ki-Moon Kim--the owner of
the Golden Palace Hotel--

32:54.973 --> 32:57.476
and four of his associates
were found brutally murdered.

32:57.509 --> 32:59.345
Both local--
(TV clicks off)

33:02.314 --> 33:05.384
Epifanio did this.

33:05.417 --> 33:07.653
And then he tried
to have us killed.

33:10.156 --> 33:12.391
I never thought
it would come to this.

33:14.593 --> 33:16.195
You saved my life.

33:19.831 --> 33:22.134
Thank you.

33:22.168 --> 33:23.269
You're welcome.

33:25.003 --> 33:28.774
So...let Guero live.

33:34.546 --> 33:38.317
$3 million, courtesy of
Epifanio Vargas for our payment

33:38.350 --> 33:40.319
to El Santo.

33:40.352 --> 33:42.754
Epifanio's gonna be
contacting you

33:42.788 --> 33:44.723
to arrange the pick-up
of the coke.

33:44.756 --> 33:47.293
That should be
an enjoyable phone call.

33:49.128 --> 33:50.362
I'm gonna need a minute.

33:58.937 --> 34:00.139
Come on.

34:09.115 --> 34:10.749
Denny's contact
at the Dallas P.D.

34:10.782 --> 34:13.385
said he was almost caught today.

34:13.419 --> 34:15.721
JAMES: So the cops know
he's in town.

34:18.224 --> 34:20.426
You were right.

34:20.459 --> 34:22.461
I should've
taken care of it in Bolivia.

34:22.494 --> 34:24.763
JAMES: He can't stay here.

34:24.796 --> 34:27.733
I'm not ready to make
that decision yet.

34:27.766 --> 34:31.270
We first have to
move the product.

34:31.303 --> 34:32.971
You're not giving it
to Epifanio.

34:33.004 --> 34:35.374
JAMES: We have another payment
to El Santo in a week.

34:35.407 --> 34:36.875
(sighs)

34:36.908 --> 34:39.211
(dark music)

34:39.245 --> 34:42.714
He threatened your daughter.

34:42.748 --> 34:47.119
You were right about Guero,
now you're second guessing it.

34:47.153 --> 34:48.554
I don't know where
this is coming from, Camila,

34:48.587 --> 34:50.088
but this isn't like you.

34:50.122 --> 34:51.390
-This is messy.
-Well then I clean it up

34:51.423 --> 34:54.226
like I always do.

34:54.260 --> 34:56.428
Get that filthy money
out of here.

34:56.462 --> 35:01.133
*

35:07.606 --> 35:09.441
Hi.

35:09.475 --> 35:10.909
Your friends are really nice.

35:10.942 --> 35:13.312
Yeah, Deborah pisses
on her husband.

35:13.345 --> 35:15.080
-What?
-Yeah, I know.

35:15.113 --> 35:16.782
Well, Roger wasn't getting
it up anymore,

35:16.815 --> 35:18.450
so they decided to try
a little something new

35:18.484 --> 35:20.652
and it actually worked
for a little while.

35:20.686 --> 35:22.588
The only problem is
now when Debbie goes into

35:22.621 --> 35:25.090
a public restroom, she kinda
gags a little bit.

35:25.123 --> 35:27.092
(laughs)

35:27.125 --> 35:28.960
And you see Misty over there?
She's been having an affair

35:28.994 --> 35:30.729
with her husband's partner
for the last three years.

35:32.398 --> 35:34.466
And then Tina,
she ran up a hundred grand

35:34.500 --> 35:37.436
on her husband's AmEx card
last month.

35:37.469 --> 35:40.138
Doesn't know she's about
to be cut off.

35:40.172 --> 35:42.974
We all kinda gave up our lives
for the fairy tale,

35:43.008 --> 35:45.211
but the thing is,
the fairy tale is bullshit.

35:45.244 --> 35:47.346
Why are you telling me
all of this?

35:47.379 --> 35:49.815
I'm a notorious
over-sharer.

35:49.848 --> 35:51.950
I just wanted you to know
that we ain't perfect.

35:51.983 --> 35:55.321
There's a lot of skeletons
in these walk-in closets.

35:57.489 --> 36:00.125
What's yours?

36:00.158 --> 36:02.294
My skeleton?

36:02.328 --> 36:04.129
How much time do you have?

36:04.162 --> 36:05.764
(laughs)

36:09.501 --> 36:12.003
I think your boss, Camila,
is sleeping with my husband.

36:14.706 --> 36:16.308
So that's why you asked me here?

36:16.342 --> 36:17.743
I know the position
that puts you in.

36:17.776 --> 36:20.212
She's your boss.

36:20.246 --> 36:23.048
But I hope, as a woman,
you understand

36:23.081 --> 36:24.916
the position that puts me in.

36:24.950 --> 36:26.585
Yeah, of course.

36:26.618 --> 36:28.320
(dark music)

36:28.354 --> 36:30.922
Is it true?

36:30.956 --> 36:33.492
Camila's happily married.

36:33.525 --> 36:34.860
She wouldn't do that.

36:34.893 --> 36:36.828
*

36:36.862 --> 36:38.330
(cell phone buzzing)

36:38.364 --> 36:39.831
Right.

36:39.865 --> 36:41.933
I'm sorry.
Excuse me.

36:41.967 --> 36:44.936
*

36:44.970 --> 36:46.938
-Yeah?
-Party's over.

36:46.972 --> 36:48.073
I'm outside with Camila.

36:48.106 --> 36:54.280
*

37:04.556 --> 37:11.563
*

37:12.898 --> 37:15.066
CAMILA: We have a meeting
with a potential distributor.

37:15.100 --> 37:17.269
You need to look presentable.

37:17.303 --> 37:18.770
Here.

37:18.804 --> 37:22.073
*

37:22.107 --> 37:24.042
What did Cole's wife
have to say?

37:24.075 --> 37:27.212
*

37:27.245 --> 37:32.083
Nothing, some boring stuff
about wine and yogurt.

37:32.117 --> 37:34.453
Something wrong?

37:34.486 --> 37:37.789
Guero needs to leave Dallas
as soon as possible.

37:37.823 --> 37:39.558
We're letting him live,

37:39.591 --> 37:42.227
as long as he goes away.

37:42.260 --> 37:45.897
*

37:45.931 --> 37:48.400
I understand.

37:48.434 --> 37:50.336
And I understand you love him,

37:50.369 --> 37:53.572
but I'm not gonna allow
matters of the heart

37:53.605 --> 37:56.675
to risk my business.

37:56.708 --> 37:58.176
(phone buzzing)

38:01.012 --> 38:03.915
Epifanio, hello.
(phone beeps)

38:03.949 --> 38:07.118
I trust you have received the
money I sent for your payment.

38:07.152 --> 38:08.754
EPIFANIO: We need to make
arrangements for me to pick up

38:08.787 --> 38:10.489
El Santo's product.

38:10.522 --> 38:14.259
Yes, thank you so much
for the payment.

38:14.292 --> 38:16.161
But I'm not shutting down.

38:16.194 --> 38:18.930
CAMILA:
If you want your metric ton,

38:18.964 --> 38:22.100
you're welcome to come and pry
it from my cold, dead hands.

38:22.133 --> 38:27.973
*

38:28.006 --> 38:29.675
You'll see what I'm capable of

38:29.708 --> 38:31.877
when the safety of our daughter
is at stake.

38:31.910 --> 38:34.480
EPIFANIO: I know what it's like
for a family to live in fear

38:34.513 --> 38:36.147
of a madman.

38:36.181 --> 38:39.618
I'm not afraid of crocodiles.

38:39.651 --> 38:41.553
And I'm not afraid of you.

38:41.587 --> 38:44.690
CAMILA: I choose war.
Or did you forget that?

38:44.723 --> 38:47.493
(dial tone hums)
(phone beeps)

38:47.526 --> 38:49.795
*

38:49.828 --> 38:52.798
I'm sorry.

38:52.831 --> 38:55.300
I'm sorry El Santo
threatened your daughter.

38:55.333 --> 38:57.636
Don't be.

38:57.669 --> 39:00.972
She was never at any risk.

39:01.006 --> 39:03.475
*

39:03.509 --> 39:06.645
You sent her the charm.

39:06.678 --> 39:09.347
I knew how Epifanio
would react.

39:09.381 --> 39:12.317
I knew he would give us the cash
to pay El Santo.

39:12.350 --> 39:16.021
My daughter was never
in any danger.

39:17.389 --> 39:22.661
*

39:22.694 --> 39:25.363
CAMILA: Since we lost our
first and second distributors,

39:25.397 --> 39:27.265
we're meeting with
a potential new one,

39:27.298 --> 39:29.100
Devon Finch.

39:29.134 --> 39:32.604
If we land him, we'll have
all the distro we need.

39:32.638 --> 39:39.611
*

39:39.645 --> 39:41.547
You can wait for us here.

39:41.580 --> 39:46.952
*

39:46.985 --> 39:48.954
All right, so if you can get me
out of this room

39:48.987 --> 39:50.021
as soon as possible...

39:50.055 --> 39:54.292
*

39:54.325 --> 39:56.194
Good afternoon.

39:56.227 --> 39:57.963
I'm Devon Finch.

39:57.996 --> 40:00.699
Camila Vargas, this is my
associate, Teresa Mendoza.

40:00.732 --> 40:02.367
-Nice to meet you.
-Please forgive the rush.

40:02.400 --> 40:05.704
I'm on a flight to Chicago
in eight minutes.

40:05.737 --> 40:09.274
Bristol dropped by 16, check on
that pharma short with Stu.

40:09.307 --> 40:12.778
$250,000 buy me a hello
but not a meeting.

40:12.811 --> 40:14.145
If you're looking to invest,

40:14.179 --> 40:15.814
I'm afraid my broker days
are over.

40:15.847 --> 40:17.616
But I can refer some people.

40:17.649 --> 40:19.618
CAMILA: Stock is not
a stable commodity.

40:19.651 --> 40:21.987
But I believe
a private jet company is.

40:24.856 --> 40:28.093
My company's not for sale, and
I'm not looking for a partner.

40:28.126 --> 40:31.296
If you're looking to buy in
aviation, I'd suggest Delta.

40:31.329 --> 40:33.465
Does Delta fly to Bolivia?

40:35.200 --> 40:38.670
Because I have about 30 million
reasons why you should.

40:38.704 --> 40:42.774
*

40:42.808 --> 40:46.077
I've never been there,
but I hear La Paz is nice.

40:46.111 --> 40:48.079
It's better than
you can imagine.

40:48.113 --> 40:49.981
*

40:50.015 --> 40:51.917
It's been a sincere pleasure
meeting you both,

40:51.950 --> 40:54.352
and once again, thank you for
your generous donation.

40:54.385 --> 40:59.925
*

40:59.958 --> 41:01.593
Today, we announce the formation

41:01.627 --> 41:04.530
of a joint U.S.-Mexico
drug task force,

41:04.563 --> 41:07.533
headed by Special Agent
in Charge, Alonzo Loya,

41:07.566 --> 41:09.434
of the Drug Enforcement Agency

41:09.467 --> 41:12.470
and Colonel Alberto Cortez
of the Mexican Federales.

41:12.504 --> 41:13.539
CHRISTOPHER:
As we move forward...

41:13.572 --> 41:15.140
Her cold, dead hands.

41:15.173 --> 41:18.109
(speaking Spanish)

41:18.143 --> 41:19.778
CHRISTOPHER: Drug warfare
that has invaded this city.

41:19.811 --> 41:22.213
CHRISTOPHER: And now,
the Governor of Sinaloa,

41:22.247 --> 41:23.949
Epifanio Vargas.

41:23.982 --> 41:26.284
JAMES: Epifanio created
a task force with the feds.

41:26.317 --> 41:27.786
CAMILA:
He's coming after our product.

41:27.819 --> 41:30.121
He's brought the war to us.

41:30.155 --> 41:32.057
EPIFANIO:
Good afternoon, Dallas.

41:32.090 --> 41:35.694
Since becoming governor,
I fought the cartel in Culiacán.

41:35.727 --> 41:38.463
Now, together with the DEA,

41:38.496 --> 41:40.398
I'll bring the battle to Texas.

41:40.431 --> 41:42.568
(indistinct chatter)

41:42.601 --> 41:48.273
*

41:51.042 --> 41:54.012
(dark music)

41:54.045 --> 42:01.052
*

42:06.024 --> 42:08.994
