WEBVTT

00:45.087 --> 00:47.338
-Hello?
-l apologize for the hour.

00:47.423 --> 00:50.091
You instructed me to avoid your offices.

00:50.175 --> 00:51.926
But we have good news.

00:53.971 --> 00:55.430
Thank goodness.

00:55.514 --> 00:59.058
The Hansard procedure negotiations
have concluded as promised.

00:59.143 --> 01:02.812
You need only wire
the full Â£2,900 by Thursday

01:02.896 --> 01:06.232
and your slate will be clear
with the lnland Revenue.

01:06.316 --> 01:07.859
As promised?

01:07.943 --> 01:11.154
Your promise was to extricate me
from this situation altogether.

01:11.238 --> 01:13.364
My promise was to keep you out of prison.

01:14.450 --> 01:15.825
Thursday.

01:15.909 --> 01:18.953
How am l supposed to find
$8,000 in two days?

01:19.037 --> 01:21.038
That's not possible. That's no help at all.

01:21.123 --> 01:24.792
Look, Lane, you gave
Her Majesty's portion to a foreign power,

01:24.877 --> 01:28.212
and the tax man is keen
to make an example of an expatriate.

01:28.672 --> 01:31.924
This is the very best news there could be.

01:32.009 --> 01:33.551
You should get a pencil.

01:33.635 --> 01:35.970
l'll give you the information.

01:43.270 --> 01:44.687
What are you doing out here?

01:44.772 --> 01:47.064
Business. Get back to bed, dear.

01:47.483 --> 01:50.151
-What are you looking for?
-Go back to bed this minute!

01:57.993 --> 02:00.995
Scarlett, hold this and stand here.

02:01.789 --> 02:03.206
No.

02:03.290 --> 02:05.708
Mr. Kinsey called regarding lunch.

02:06.752 --> 02:09.754
-What does he want?
-l think he wants to have lunch.

02:09.838 --> 02:12.590
-What's wrong with him? He's very polite.
-Yeah.

02:12.674 --> 02:14.842
You should have seen him
at Ken's bachelor party.

02:14.927 --> 02:17.970
-l think he was on LSD.
-Really?

02:18.889 --> 02:22.308
He's sort of been threatening to "spot" by.

02:22.392 --> 02:24.227
Scarlett, here you are.

02:24.311 --> 02:26.521
l'm sorry, Mr. Pryce. Do you need me?

02:26.605 --> 02:30.107
Only in that l wanted you
to direct me to Mr. Crane.

02:30.192 --> 02:31.567
Please leave us.

02:31.652 --> 02:33.694
l'll meet him for coffee.

02:36.490 --> 02:40.159
l was hoping we could discuss
the first quarter media projections.

02:40.244 --> 02:41.369
Sure.

02:48.168 --> 02:49.752
These numbers are very positive.

02:49.837 --> 02:51.629
They're projections.

02:51.713 --> 02:54.465
They're derived from reality,
but they're hopes and dreams.

02:54.550 --> 02:56.008
January and February look great.

02:56.093 --> 02:58.594
Heinz, Mohawk, Vicks, all pretty stable.

02:58.679 --> 03:00.346
When will they become commitments?

03:00.430 --> 03:01.806
l can't predict the future, Lane.

03:01.890 --> 03:03.224
l don't know
what the Russians are going to do.

03:03.308 --> 03:05.059
We may be living underground
by Lincoln's birthday.

03:09.231 --> 03:10.523
That's my only copy.

03:16.029 --> 03:19.282
Hope you don't need any actual paperwork
because everything's out by my desk

03:19.366 --> 03:21.492
and my desk is out by Chuck.

03:22.744 --> 03:23.786
How's Rebecca?

03:24.246 --> 03:27.039
About the same, underfed and underpaid.

03:27.124 --> 03:28.165
And Laura?

03:28.250 --> 03:30.835
She calls me during the day
and she's peachy.

03:30.919 --> 03:32.587
But l come home and she's blue.

03:33.755 --> 03:35.590
-To the holidays.
-To gin.

03:36.174 --> 03:40.261
So, Walt, what do you think
about extending our credit by $50,000?

03:42.306 --> 03:45.057
l didn't know we were
going to talk real business.

03:45.851 --> 03:47.602
Should l slow down?

03:50.606 --> 03:52.565
How do things look for '67?

03:52.649 --> 03:55.109
The projections suggest...

03:55.193 --> 03:58.362
No projections.
We're only interested in commitments.

03:58.447 --> 04:00.323
Yes, the commitments are firm,

04:00.407 --> 04:02.950
but no one's been paying their bills on time.

04:04.244 --> 04:05.786
l got it. Done.

04:08.165 --> 04:09.707
Are you going away?

04:09.791 --> 04:12.376
No. l love Christmas in Manhattan.

04:12.461 --> 04:15.922
Can you take care of it today?
l'd like to start writing checks immediately.

04:16.298 --> 04:17.423
Sure.

04:17.507 --> 04:19.383
We're heading to Florida.

04:19.468 --> 04:22.637
l want to fly, but l think we're going to drive.

04:37.653 --> 04:40.279
-Roger, Cooper's office.
-Coming.

04:43.158 --> 04:45.117
What's the hurry, Harry?

04:45.661 --> 04:46.827
Are you drunk?

04:46.912 --> 04:49.538
Pearl Harbor Day. Show some respect.

04:49.623 --> 04:51.165
How are you doing with your bombing?

04:51.249 --> 04:54.085
Remember Lane's fool at Jaguar,
Edwin Baker?

04:54.169 --> 04:55.962
You mean Bazooka Joe?

04:57.631 --> 04:59.882
Three weeks ago,
he was replaced by Hugh Hibbert,

04:59.967 --> 05:01.342
and we are back in the running.

05:01.426 --> 05:04.178
-He called you?
-No, l called him.

05:04.262 --> 05:06.639
ln fact, l've been working
a few prospects over there for months,

05:06.723 --> 05:08.766
waiting for Edwin to self-destruct,

05:08.850 --> 05:10.226
and he did...

05:10.310 --> 05:12.353
Spectacularly, apparently.

05:12.437 --> 05:15.356
He vomited in the lap
of the head of the dealers association.

05:17.859 --> 05:18.901
Who else?

05:19.194 --> 05:23.114
lt sounds like Foote Cone,
Ted Bates, D'Arcy.

05:23.198 --> 05:24.991
Everyone who doesn't have a car.

05:25.075 --> 05:27.326
-What is that, nine of us?
-No, it's five.

05:27.411 --> 05:28.828
And size-wise, we're the smallest,

05:28.912 --> 05:31.122
so let's all start boning up
on the wonders of Jaguar.

05:31.206 --> 05:32.456
We have a meet-and-greet next week

05:32.541 --> 05:35.251
and the presentations
are sometime in mid-January.

05:35.335 --> 05:36.711
That's a lot of work.

05:37.212 --> 05:40.047
Yes. You may have to stay past 5:30.

05:40.465 --> 05:43.426
l'd live here if l thought
it was more than a pipe dream.

05:48.473 --> 05:50.266
We reject the material world

05:50.350 --> 05:53.310
in favor of the recognition
of one's true identity.

05:54.021 --> 05:55.646
l don't understand what you're saying.

05:56.106 --> 05:57.189
Paul?

05:59.401 --> 06:02.236
Harry Crane, as l live and breathe.

06:02.738 --> 06:04.655
What the hell happened to you?

06:04.740 --> 06:06.365
Krishna consciousness.

06:12.873 --> 06:14.123
Don't pretend this isn't strange.

06:14.583 --> 06:16.042
That's why l wanted you to see it.

06:16.334 --> 06:18.669
Consider it seen. l really should be going.

06:18.754 --> 06:21.756
Harry, l've been trying to get you down here.

06:21.840 --> 06:26.177
Remember how anxious, how insecure,
how terrified l was of living life?

06:26.678 --> 06:28.220
lt's gone.

06:28.305 --> 06:30.347
Can you imagine living that way, Harry?

06:30.766 --> 06:32.266
l'm sorry, this is giving me the willies.

06:32.350 --> 06:34.310
Please, keep an open mind.

06:34.394 --> 06:36.187
Can we do this for a few minutes?

06:36.271 --> 06:37.980
Am l allowed to be here?

06:38.065 --> 06:40.983
-Everyone's allowed to be here.
-Hello, there.

06:41.568 --> 06:43.736
Harry, this is Mother Lakshmi.

06:44.196 --> 06:45.946
Hare Krishna, Harry.

06:46.448 --> 06:48.324
-l get it.
-Get what?

07:12.557 --> 07:14.517
-l should go.
-No.

07:14.643 --> 07:15.810
Chant with us.

07:16.436 --> 07:19.188
You'll like it. l promise.

07:53.265 --> 07:56.016
Roger's not coming.
He's on Battleship Row.

07:57.018 --> 07:58.269
But l've already told him.

07:59.146 --> 08:00.688
l called this meeting.

08:01.022 --> 08:02.439
Where's Joan?

08:02.524 --> 08:04.608
lt's best Joan's not here
for my announcement.

08:04.693 --> 08:06.360
l don't know about yours.

08:09.364 --> 08:11.157
-Go ahead.
-Very well.

08:12.033 --> 08:14.869
A recent pass of the books
shows that we have

08:14.953 --> 08:18.372
a surplus of $50,000,

08:18.957 --> 08:22.918
and l believe that enables us
to distribute Christmas bonuses.

08:24.171 --> 08:27.673
Equal shares to full partners,
half shares to juniors,

08:27.757 --> 08:31.468
2% gifts to S.N.C. and 4% E.N.C.

08:31.553 --> 08:33.762
God bless us, everyone.

08:34.973 --> 08:37.558
And l shall see to it that
the checks are distributed immediately.

08:37.642 --> 08:40.227
Actually, let's wait till the Christmas party.

08:41.396 --> 08:44.356
Someone's not going to be happy,
and l'd rather not stare at her for a month.

08:45.400 --> 08:46.442
Approved.

08:46.818 --> 08:48.110
-Don...
-l have to announce

08:48.195 --> 08:51.113
that we're in the running...
l mean, actually this time

08:51.198 --> 08:52.239
for Jaguar.

08:52.657 --> 08:56.160
So it's time we all get some learning
on this fine automobile.

08:56.244 --> 08:58.495
l intend to drive the Mark ll this afternoon.

08:59.039 --> 09:00.122
Don,

09:00.707 --> 09:05.085
don't you think the bonuses would
make more of an impact now?

09:05.921 --> 09:08.130
There's nothing like a surprise for morale.

09:08.423 --> 09:09.548
Not my morale.

09:09.841 --> 09:12.218
The Jaguar announcement
should be good for morale.

09:12.302 --> 09:14.178
And, as much as it affects me personally,

09:14.262 --> 09:16.180
l think we should sit tight on the bonuses.

09:16.264 --> 09:19.350
Jaguar will provide only a little seed
and we'll have to supplement.

09:19.434 --> 09:20.434
Damn it!

09:21.770 --> 09:23.938
We can afford to do both.

09:24.022 --> 09:26.774
-What ghost visited you, Ebenezer?
-Pete.

09:27.234 --> 09:28.984
You asked me to stop this last time.

09:29.069 --> 09:30.319
Yes, other than Roger,

09:30.403 --> 09:33.697
who started drinking
at exactly 7:55 this morning,

09:33.782 --> 09:37.201
no one has given me the reaction l desire

09:37.285 --> 09:39.286
from this blessed event.

09:39.788 --> 09:40.788
Bert.

09:41.248 --> 09:43.624
They're lemons. They never start.

09:44.960 --> 09:46.377
Meeting adjourned.

09:52.259 --> 09:53.342
You like my shirt?

09:55.220 --> 09:56.971
lt's very festive.

09:57.681 --> 09:59.014
You know, it's sacrilege to say this,

09:59.099 --> 10:02.309
but Pearl Harbor was an act of genius.

10:03.687 --> 10:06.146
The only thing they didn't plan for
was success.

10:06.231 --> 10:09.358
The Japs won
and they didn't know what to do with it.

10:10.193 --> 10:11.318
Mr. Sterling,

10:12.696 --> 10:14.405
seeing as you're dressed for fishing,

10:14.489 --> 10:17.283
you'll have more success if you're quiet.

10:20.495 --> 10:21.829
Don't be like that.

10:22.831 --> 10:24.081
l couldn't care less.

10:24.165 --> 10:26.000
l know why you're mad.

10:29.045 --> 10:30.754
But Jane is not going to take everything.

10:30.839 --> 10:32.840
lt never occurred to me.

10:32.924 --> 10:34.591
Because the Army is
taking such good care of you?

10:34.676 --> 10:36.719
-Have l asked?
-No.

10:36.803 --> 10:40.055
And you shouldn't have to and you don't
and you keep sending it back.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.557
Because it's a short-term solution.

10:41.641 --> 10:44.893
-l told you, l'll cover Kevin through college.
-No.

10:45.437 --> 10:46.895
lt's better this way for him.

10:46.980 --> 10:50.357
And if you're not careful,
you won't even be a family friend.

10:50.650 --> 10:53.152
-Joanie, l had an experience.
-l know, Roger.

10:53.236 --> 10:54.945
lt's not about honor.

10:55.030 --> 10:58.824
lt's about the fact that
we created a human life.

11:00.285 --> 11:01.827
We made a baby.

11:02.620 --> 11:03.704
Yes.

11:04.331 --> 11:07.166
And now it's some other lucky girl's turn.

11:10.545 --> 11:11.795
Scarlett.

11:14.632 --> 11:15.841
Hello.

11:35.236 --> 11:39.698
All of us have a very close connection.

11:40.450 --> 11:41.700
Krishna.

11:42.202 --> 11:44.078
My head is humming.

11:44.162 --> 11:46.080
And your mind is clear.

11:47.082 --> 11:48.332
Yeah.

11:48.833 --> 11:50.000
l should be getting back.

11:50.085 --> 11:52.044
Holy shit, how long have l been here?

11:52.796 --> 11:55.756
-Are you hungry?
-l am.

11:56.591 --> 11:58.384
Paramatma, take him for some food.

11:58.468 --> 12:00.594
Yes, Mother Lakshmi.
That's a beautiful idea.

12:00.678 --> 12:03.514
-Harry, will you eat with me?
-Just the two of us?

12:09.145 --> 12:11.355
But when we are

12:12.190 --> 12:14.483
in the material, conditional life,

12:15.485 --> 12:16.985
we forget this.

12:21.825 --> 12:23.492
lt is so good to see you.

12:24.619 --> 12:26.703
lt's good to see you, too.

12:26.788 --> 12:28.539
But l'm not gonna join.

12:28.623 --> 12:30.332
l don't want you to.

12:30.417 --> 12:33.293
But l can tell you really got into that.

12:33.378 --> 12:35.754
l can tell you really got into Lakshmi.

12:35.839 --> 12:38.048
l love her deeply, Harry.

12:38.133 --> 12:40.884
Absolutely. She's my kind of religion.

12:40.969 --> 12:42.594
lt's not like that.

12:42.679 --> 12:44.972
Lakshmi lived most of her life
as a girl named Janet,

12:45.056 --> 12:48.434
whose promiscuity
led her to drugs and prostitution.

12:48.518 --> 12:50.269
The movement saved her life.

12:50.353 --> 12:52.354
So what's your excuse?

12:54.649 --> 12:56.442
l was at rock bottom.

12:56.985 --> 12:58.944
l had really degraded myself.

12:59.028 --> 13:00.988
-At McCann?
-No, damn it.

13:01.364 --> 13:02.364
Listen,

13:02.991 --> 13:05.492
l love what the movement has given me,

13:05.577 --> 13:09.371
but l don't understand
why l have to live like that to love God.

13:10.165 --> 13:11.290
Are they making you stay?

13:12.125 --> 13:13.792
lt's just Lakshmi.

13:14.335 --> 13:17.045
-So you don't wanna share, huh?
-You don't understand.

13:17.130 --> 13:20.174
l want to make a life with her, but not there.

13:20.842 --> 13:22.509
So what does that have to do with me?

13:23.303 --> 13:25.762
She was a runaway, and she won't leave

13:25.847 --> 13:28.390
unless she knows
she won't wind up back on the streets.

13:28.475 --> 13:30.142
You want money. l knew it.

13:30.226 --> 13:31.560
You know what? Go eat by yourself.

13:31.644 --> 13:32.895
Stop, stop.

13:32.979 --> 13:34.688
Money solves today, not tomorrow.

13:34.772 --> 13:36.565
Up here on the right.

13:37.150 --> 13:39.526
And for your information,
Prabhupad is buying.

13:42.155 --> 13:43.947
l'm sorry l said

13:44.032 --> 13:46.492
l couldn't come because of the accident.

13:46.576 --> 13:47.910
l'm sorry.

13:48.536 --> 13:49.870
Excuse me.

13:56.002 --> 13:58.712
"Can you help me, doctor?" l asked him.

14:00.381 --> 14:03.467
"lt started... lt started," l said,

14:04.052 --> 14:06.386
"when l was sitting in front
of the television set

14:06.471 --> 14:08.222
"with my feet on the coffee table.

14:08.306 --> 14:10.974
"Now, l've sat there hundreds of times,

14:11.059 --> 14:14.311
"thousands maybe,
with a can of beer in my hand.

14:14.395 --> 14:18.023
"l like to have a can of beer in my hand
when l watch the beer ads.

14:18.983 --> 14:21.985
"But now, for no reason l could think of,

14:22.070 --> 14:24.780
"the ad was making me sick.

14:24.864 --> 14:28.242
"So l used the remote control
to get to another channel,

14:28.326 --> 14:31.161
"but each channel made me just as sick.

14:31.996 --> 14:33.830
"The television was one thing,

14:33.915 --> 14:36.917
"and l was a person,
and l was going to be sick.

14:37.752 --> 14:39.127
"So l turned it off

14:39.462 --> 14:41.421
"and had a panicky moment.

14:41.506 --> 14:43.674
"l smelled the beer in my hand.

14:43.758 --> 14:46.468
"And as l vomited,
l looked around the living room

14:46.553 --> 14:48.428
"for something to grab onto."

14:50.306 --> 14:52.849
-Do you want something to eat?
-Nope.

14:55.895 --> 14:56.895
Come on.

14:57.230 --> 14:59.022
l didn't have dinner.

15:00.108 --> 15:02.109
-You want a drink?
-Yep.

15:03.653 --> 15:05.070
"Yep. Nope."

15:05.738 --> 15:07.698
Should have been our wedding vows.

15:07.782 --> 15:09.324
l'm just tired.

15:09.993 --> 15:11.368
No, you're not.

15:13.288 --> 15:14.746
l don't understand.

15:14.831 --> 15:17.708
l've heard you say
a lot worse things about advertising.

15:18.710 --> 15:20.919
The mighty theater
punches its audience in the face

15:21.004 --> 15:23.964
with its subtle message.
There's a challenge.

15:24.757 --> 15:27.801
Let me tell you, people buy things
because it makes them feel better.

15:27.885 --> 15:29.928
We could have had dinner with Charles.

15:30.013 --> 15:32.389
He's an understudy.
That may be his only performance.

15:32.473 --> 15:33.890
l don't mind picking up
the check for your friends,

15:33.975 --> 15:36.393
-but not if they insult me first.
-l'm sorry.

15:36.477 --> 15:39.563
People make fun of acting all the time,
and you love it.

15:39.647 --> 15:43.066
And l didn't think it was
such a strong stand against advertising

15:43.151 --> 15:45.235
as much as the emptiness of consumerism.

15:45.653 --> 15:48.864
No one's made a stronger stand
against advertising than you.

15:59.626 --> 16:03.503
You know, l was scared when Bea was born,
but she's such a joy.

16:04.464 --> 16:07.507
l actually saw
her face float by while l was chanting.

16:08.092 --> 16:10.302
Really? You had a vision?

16:11.220 --> 16:12.346
l guess.

16:13.723 --> 16:17.351
And you kind of think
you're tied to this person forever.

16:18.186 --> 16:20.771
Not my little girl. You know, Jennifer.

16:20.855 --> 16:22.230
And now with another one on the way...

16:22.774 --> 16:25.359
l want a family with Lakshmi.

16:25.443 --> 16:27.194
And a farm, maybe outside Frisco.

16:27.737 --> 16:29.529
You're gonna have to do
a little less recruiting

16:29.614 --> 16:31.239
and a little more working.

16:31.824 --> 16:33.116
About that...

16:33.201 --> 16:36.078
l don't have a job for you, Paul.
l've thought about that.

16:36.162 --> 16:37.329
lt's the whole reason l didn't wanna see you.

16:37.413 --> 16:40.540
But you can help me
because l have been working.

16:43.044 --> 16:44.878
You've been writing?

16:45.755 --> 16:48.382
l think this is the most meaningful
work l've ever done in my life.

16:50.885 --> 16:54.262
lt's a speculative episode
of the hit television show Star Trek.

16:56.808 --> 16:57.891
Are you kidding me?

16:58.017 --> 16:59.810
l think it should be
their season opener next year.

17:00.019 --> 17:01.561
lf there is one.

17:01.646 --> 17:03.772
lt's a tough time slot.
My Three Sons, Bewitched,

17:03.856 --> 17:06.066
-that thing's a juggernaut.
-lt'll be there.

17:06.401 --> 17:07.651
Where the hell do you watch it?

17:07.735 --> 17:10.070
Through the window
of a pizza parlor on MacDougal.

17:10.446 --> 17:12.823
-What, do you lip-read?
-l've seen the show,

17:12.907 --> 17:16.118
and l think l've made a good effort
at matching the moral complexities

17:16.202 --> 17:18.078
tinged with adventure that draw people to it.

17:19.831 --> 17:21.331
Just read the first 1 5 pages.

17:21.416 --> 17:23.250
lf you don't think
it's good enough for network television,

17:23.334 --> 17:26.503
then you don't have to
pass it along to the executives at NBC

17:26.587 --> 17:30.090
or even think about trying
to get it to Mr. Roddenberry.

17:30.758 --> 17:32.551
That's kind of a line you don't cross, Paul.

17:32.927 --> 17:34.803
Who do you think you're talking to?

17:34.887 --> 17:37.764
How much do you buy at NBC?
You don't have any leverage?

17:39.016 --> 17:40.100
Okay.

17:42.103 --> 17:44.187
-ls it about Hare Krishna?
-No.

17:44.272 --> 17:47.274
Not literally,
but they don't tell literal stories.

17:49.402 --> 17:52.446
Look, you had a vision your first time.

17:53.656 --> 17:55.991
Not that l wasn't
in a state of bliss for the first few months,

17:56.075 --> 17:58.201
but something happened.

17:58.286 --> 18:00.287
l try to clear my head, but l can't.

18:00.371 --> 18:02.581
lt's too busy in there.

18:02.665 --> 18:04.916
Everybody else looks so happy.

18:06.127 --> 18:08.545
You know, l got there
and l started trying to figure out

18:08.629 --> 18:10.380
who Prabhupad likes best.

18:10.465 --> 18:12.591
lt's the same as everywhere l go.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.885
He doesn't like me.

18:14.969 --> 18:16.219
No one likes me.

18:16.304 --> 18:19.347
Sometimes l think Krishna
doesn't even like me.

18:20.224 --> 18:21.683
No one but Lakshmi.

18:24.896 --> 18:26.897
Will you read the script?

20:19.760 --> 20:20.844
Can l ask you something?

20:20.928 --> 20:23.179
Why didn't you bring in Paul Kinsey
when you hired Ginsberg?

20:23.264 --> 20:24.389
He wasn't submitted.

20:24.724 --> 20:27.684
-You didn't consider him?
-Was l supposed to?

20:27.768 --> 20:29.561
As far as l know, he was at McCann,

20:29.645 --> 20:33.773
and then Y&R, then he rolled
downhill through K&E and B&B.

20:33.858 --> 20:35.775
And last thing l heard,
he was in-house at A.M.P.

20:36.277 --> 20:37.402
Who's A.M.P.?

20:37.653 --> 20:39.571
No, l'm sorry. The A.M.P.

20:41.741 --> 20:44.200
Will you read a script
he wrote for Star Trek?

20:44.702 --> 20:46.161
Harry, if he asked you to pass it along,

20:46.245 --> 20:47.537
l don't think this is what he meant.

20:47.622 --> 20:50.415
l know what he meant,
but l need a second opinion.

20:51.375 --> 20:52.542
Aren't you curious?

20:54.754 --> 20:58.298
ls it going to give me a case
of the "nee-groan complex"?

20:59.258 --> 21:00.467
lt's really bad.

21:00.551 --> 21:03.678
And it's pronounced "neh-grahn"
because it rhymes with "katahn,"

21:03.763 --> 21:06.890
which the negron
pick under slavery to the caucasons.

21:06.974 --> 21:08.433
That's a twist.

21:08.517 --> 21:11.353
No, the twist is that the negron are white.

21:12.647 --> 21:15.482
Great. Now l'm not
gonna get anything done.

21:15.983 --> 21:17.734
He really hopes this will change his life.

21:17.818 --> 21:19.069
What am l gonna do?

21:19.612 --> 21:21.404
You really wanna help him, don't you?

21:21.489 --> 21:24.783
So what?
Really, do you know how lucky we are?

21:25.785 --> 21:27.994
lf you really wanna help,

21:28.079 --> 21:30.914
be honest with him
and tell him he needs to write a better script.

21:31.499 --> 21:32.999
l think it was really hard for him.

21:33.626 --> 21:35.168
Then he shouldn't be doing it.

21:41.509 --> 21:43.510
Mr. Campbell to see you.

21:50.601 --> 21:52.018
Send him in.

21:54.981 --> 21:56.356
So what's your favorite Jaguar?

21:57.358 --> 21:58.775
Did you send over a packet?

21:59.193 --> 22:00.819
No, l drove them.

22:00.903 --> 22:02.529
Someone drove me.

22:02.613 --> 22:04.030
l don't know how to operate a stick shift.

22:04.532 --> 22:05.782
l'll go this afternoon.

22:05.866 --> 22:08.827
See that you do, because your opinion
means a lot more than mine.

22:08.911 --> 22:11.246
Take Megan.
See how they deal with a couple.

22:12.665 --> 22:13.790
We'll see.

22:14.208 --> 22:18.128
You know, if l told you last December that
we'd be in the running for a car,

22:18.212 --> 22:19.921
you would have kissed me on the mouth.

22:20.006 --> 22:22.465
Maybe you and l should go as a couple.

22:30.224 --> 22:32.308
Well, that is good to hear.

22:32.393 --> 22:35.645
Pity having to deplete
the resources this time of year,

22:35.730 --> 22:37.313
but it had to be done.

22:37.398 --> 22:40.650
l've been assured the funds should
be accessible immediately.

22:40.735 --> 22:41.735
Very well.

22:41.819 --> 22:44.070
There is the matter of my fee.

22:45.573 --> 22:47.240
Yes, of course.

22:47.324 --> 22:49.242
After the holidays? Good day.

22:54.999 --> 22:56.666
Joan, you have a guest in reception.

22:56.751 --> 22:58.543
He needs a signature.

23:04.842 --> 23:06.384
Are you Joan Harris?

23:06.927 --> 23:08.303
Yes, that's me.

23:09.555 --> 23:11.639
-You're served.
-What?

23:18.230 --> 23:19.314
Damn it.

23:20.524 --> 23:22.025
Why did you let him in?

23:22.485 --> 23:25.028
-He said he needed to talk to you.
-About what?

23:25.112 --> 23:27.906
l don't remember
everything everybody says.

23:27.990 --> 23:29.824
Because you're an idiot!

23:30.659 --> 23:31.951
Don't talk to me like that.

23:32.036 --> 23:35.455
Do you understand having you out here
is the same as having no one?

23:35.539 --> 23:38.458
He said he knew you.
He said it was a surprise.

23:38.542 --> 23:39.918
A surprise?

23:40.002 --> 23:42.670
Thank you for that. Here's a surprise!

23:43.172 --> 23:44.255
-Joan!
-Surprise!

23:44.340 --> 23:46.174
There's an airplane here to see you!

23:46.509 --> 23:48.301
You're not allowed to do that.

23:48.385 --> 23:50.095
-Come on.
-Stop it.

23:57.728 --> 23:59.479
-What's going on?
-Nothing.

24:00.231 --> 24:02.190
-Come with me.
-l'm fine.

24:05.611 --> 24:06.653
Don.

24:07.488 --> 24:09.030
Come on, let's go.

24:09.115 --> 24:10.615
lt's too early for lunch.

24:10.699 --> 24:14.160
-We're not going to lunch.
-l don't even have my coat.

24:36.350 --> 24:38.059
Look at your watch.

24:39.186 --> 24:40.603
Well, hello.

24:42.523 --> 24:43.690
What brings you in today?

24:44.233 --> 24:46.651
We got tired of waiting for a cab.

24:46.735 --> 24:48.153
Thought we'd buy a car.

24:48.821 --> 24:51.239
Let's see if l can get out of your way.

24:53.367 --> 24:54.951
What's this one?

24:55.286 --> 24:56.536
lt's the Mark ll.

24:56.620 --> 24:58.955
lt's roomy, quiet,
good for a night on the town,

24:59.039 --> 25:01.124
but can also accommodate children.

25:01.208 --> 25:02.250
Do you have any?

25:03.711 --> 25:05.336
Altogether, four.

25:05.421 --> 25:08.298
This is a car for the American road.

25:08.757 --> 25:10.758
lt's too much power for England.

25:10.843 --> 25:12.302
They don't have the space.

25:12.386 --> 25:15.346
Yeah, plus l hear the dampness is
murder on the electrical system.

25:16.056 --> 25:17.223
We've worked that out.

25:18.267 --> 25:20.894
Honey. What's that?

25:21.896 --> 25:24.480
That's the most beautiful car ever made.

25:24.565 --> 25:27.066
The XKE, or the E-Type.

25:28.068 --> 25:29.694
l want one.

25:29.778 --> 25:32.864
l'm thinking about
paying to have you drive around in this.

25:32.948 --> 25:35.867
Go get me the keys.
l'll drive her around for free.

25:35.951 --> 25:38.036
l'll have to take you out one at a time.

25:38.120 --> 25:39.662
There's no room for three.

25:40.331 --> 25:42.165
Why would we want you along?

25:42.249 --> 25:44.667
She really wants me to take it for a ride.

25:45.294 --> 25:46.502
l can't.

25:46.587 --> 25:48.296
She can drive it herself.

25:48.839 --> 25:50.340
So you're going to ride with her?

25:51.383 --> 25:52.550
Can l?

25:53.969 --> 25:55.637
How much is the car?

25:55.721 --> 25:57.013
That one?

25:57.097 --> 25:58.306
$5,600.

26:02.895 --> 26:04.395
Here's $6,000.

26:05.231 --> 26:07.774
lf we don't come back, consider it paid for.

26:15.616 --> 26:18.868
l don't know what it is.
That car does nothing for me.

26:18.953 --> 26:21.955
lt's because you're happy. You don't need it.

26:22.957 --> 26:24.040
Okay.

26:25.000 --> 26:28.795
You do not know
how hard l've tried to ignore this at work.

26:31.006 --> 26:33.925
l know what l'm doing, l have some control,

26:35.636 --> 26:38.471
but then he found a way to ruin that, too.

26:40.391 --> 26:42.267
You're gonna need to define
some of these pronouns

26:42.351 --> 26:43.601
if you want me to keep listening.

26:44.812 --> 26:48.606
Dr. Captain Harris served me
with papers in the office.

26:50.150 --> 26:51.818
He's divorcing me.

26:52.736 --> 26:55.154
Like he has the moral high ground.

26:58.242 --> 26:59.993
lt's hard on a marriage when you're apart.

27:00.077 --> 27:02.328
Really? He loves it.

27:04.164 --> 27:07.041
l'm sorry about that girl, but, you know...

27:08.460 --> 27:10.753
lt used to be
if someone needed to see me in reception,

27:10.838 --> 27:13.214
they were delivering flowers.

27:13.299 --> 27:15.174
Those flowers...

27:16.760 --> 27:19.470
God, my first week here
l thought you were dating Ali Khan.

27:20.139 --> 27:22.557
My mother raised me to be admired.

27:23.058 --> 27:24.434
But no flowers from you.

27:24.893 --> 27:26.769
You scared the shit out of me.

27:27.354 --> 27:29.856
Burt Peterson told me
you were the one person in the agency

27:29.940 --> 27:31.607
l shouldn't cross.

27:31.692 --> 27:35.111
He and Freddy had a standing argument
that you were a lesbian.

27:35.195 --> 27:37.363
You think they never
brought that up with me?

27:40.826 --> 27:42.410
Congratulations.

27:42.536 --> 27:43.828
For what?

27:45.205 --> 27:47.040
For getting divorced.

27:48.834 --> 27:52.337
Nobody realizes how bad it has to get
for that to happen.

27:52.838 --> 27:54.714
Now you get to move on.

27:55.466 --> 27:56.716
To what?

27:58.052 --> 28:00.720
To start over? With a baby?

28:02.931 --> 28:05.475
On what date do you share that news?

28:06.060 --> 28:07.769
Right after you go all the way.

28:10.814 --> 28:12.940
You'll find somebody better.

28:14.818 --> 28:16.486
You did, didn't you?

28:16.570 --> 28:18.821
You found someone perfect.

28:18.906 --> 28:20.073
l did.

28:23.619 --> 28:26.079
l feel like the office misses her.

28:27.915 --> 28:30.750
Maybe l should have kept her at reception.

28:35.047 --> 28:37.965
l don't think you should
have thrown those papers out the window.

28:39.385 --> 28:41.803
Give me some change. l want music.

28:48.143 --> 28:49.185
Hello?

28:49.269 --> 28:51.729
There's a Lakshmi here to see you.

28:52.689 --> 28:54.524
She's got a whole story.

28:56.568 --> 28:57.860
Bring her back.

28:59.154 --> 29:00.571
Scarlett, please hold all my calls.

29:12.084 --> 29:13.876
A pleasure to see you.
l hope you understand,

29:13.961 --> 29:17.171
Jennifer wants to be
very thorough in our search for a nanny.

29:17.256 --> 29:19.006
Thank you, Meredith.

29:22.761 --> 29:25.221
lf this is some kind of shakedown,
let me stop you right now.

29:25.305 --> 29:27.181
l know you're trying to recruit me.

29:28.016 --> 29:29.225
Can l have a drink?

29:30.060 --> 29:31.561
lsn't that verboten?

29:31.645 --> 29:32.812
Listen to me.

29:33.981 --> 29:35.731
l don't know what it is,

29:35.816 --> 29:38.818
but when you were chanting, l felt this...

29:40.696 --> 29:42.488
lntensity, you know?

29:43.907 --> 29:45.867
Everywhere on my body...

29:47.161 --> 29:48.953
Especially one place.

29:51.206 --> 29:52.373
Really?

29:52.458 --> 29:53.833
l was in such a state.

29:58.881 --> 30:01.507
Stop it. l thought you were with Paul.

30:02.676 --> 30:04.552
Nobody's with anybody.

30:05.429 --> 30:08.347
Paramatma does what he wants and so do l.

30:08.432 --> 30:11.767
lt doesn't mean that
we don't love each other.

30:11.852 --> 30:14.061
So there's no reason for you to say no.

30:14.688 --> 30:16.856
What about the fact that l'm married?

30:17.691 --> 30:19.734
l'm burning for you.

30:21.195 --> 30:23.321
Does your wife burn for you?

30:29.369 --> 30:31.621
So this is completely allowed?

30:46.178 --> 30:47.845
Take me like this.

30:55.812 --> 30:57.855
Not even a little Sinatra?

30:58.815 --> 31:00.316
Jimmy Durante.

31:05.280 --> 31:08.241
Look at all these people
dancing to my music.

31:12.246 --> 31:13.829
You wanna dance?

31:14.581 --> 31:16.832
l don't think we should.

31:16.917 --> 31:18.417
You sure look like you wanna dance.

31:18.502 --> 31:20.378
You and me in Midtown?

31:21.380 --> 31:23.714
You with that look on your face?

31:25.884 --> 31:27.468
What look, baby?

31:28.136 --> 31:30.846
God, you're irresistible.

31:32.891 --> 31:35.601
You know what this woman
said to me once?

31:36.478 --> 31:38.104
"l like being bad

31:38.689 --> 31:40.606
"and going home and being good."

31:40.691 --> 31:42.942
l bet that stuck to your ribs.

31:43.860 --> 31:45.528
lt was a disaster.

31:46.446 --> 31:48.948
And you enjoyed every minute of it.

31:50.784 --> 31:54.453
God, l miss that.

31:57.583 --> 32:00.001
There's a gentleman over at seven-thirty

32:00.627 --> 32:02.587
who looks like he wants to dance.

32:06.174 --> 32:08.134
Who do you think he is?

32:08.719 --> 32:10.136
Advertising?

32:11.847 --> 32:13.472
lnsurance?

32:13.557 --> 32:14.974
Lawyer?

32:17.644 --> 32:19.645
And who do you think's waiting at home?

32:21.648 --> 32:23.482
l bet she's not ugly.

32:23.984 --> 32:27.069
The only sin she's committed
is being familiar.

32:28.614 --> 32:30.406
So you think it's all him?

32:30.490 --> 32:32.992
Because she can't give him what he wants.

32:33.827 --> 32:36.495
Because he doesn't know what he wants,

32:38.165 --> 32:39.832
what he's wanting.

32:40.751 --> 32:42.001
He knows.

32:43.503 --> 32:45.463
lt's just the way he is.

32:46.548 --> 32:49.050
And maybe it's just the way she is.

32:59.144 --> 33:00.603
l'm gonna go.

33:02.397 --> 33:05.191
-l can still drive, l think.
-l can drive.

33:06.026 --> 33:07.526
You can stay.

33:08.570 --> 33:11.197
l've been sitting with you
since he walked in.

33:11.698 --> 33:13.532
Poor me, l struck out.

33:13.909 --> 33:15.910
Who's gonna believe that?

33:25.545 --> 33:26.754
Carfare,

33:27.589 --> 33:28.714
in case it doesn't work out.

33:29.549 --> 33:30.883
Mad money.

33:32.594 --> 33:33.719
Thank you.

33:35.681 --> 33:37.306
Good night, sweetheart.

33:38.642 --> 33:40.393
Stand over by the jukebox.

33:41.144 --> 33:43.437
That looked pretty good before.

34:08.588 --> 34:09.672
Are you okay?

34:10.257 --> 34:11.924
l don't know. l...

34:12.843 --> 34:15.261
My heart's beating like a rabbit.

34:15.595 --> 34:17.596
Smoking's not gonna help.

34:18.056 --> 34:20.725
Don't get all strict on me, Mother Lakshmi.

34:21.977 --> 34:24.103
But l am strict.

34:24.187 --> 34:26.313
l did this for the movement.

34:26.982 --> 34:29.442
Good to know, but l ain't joining.

34:29.985 --> 34:34.488
Although your techniques
are more persuasive than...

34:35.532 --> 34:36.657
Paul's.

34:37.200 --> 34:38.451
You're disgusting.

34:39.453 --> 34:42.455
l'm only here because l don't want you
shaking his devotion.

34:42.831 --> 34:44.832
What? How does that work?

34:45.417 --> 34:46.959
You're the worst girlfriend in the world.

34:47.294 --> 34:49.211
And you're the best friend.

34:49.296 --> 34:52.506
That's why you're giving him false hope
for his awful teleplay.

34:55.343 --> 34:57.261
He wants to have a life with you.

34:57.637 --> 35:01.056
And you know that even
if that was possible, that's not the way.

35:01.308 --> 35:02.975
Look, he doesn't know that.

35:03.059 --> 35:04.894
So why don't you just let him go?

35:04.978 --> 35:07.480
Because he's a devotee of the Lord.

35:08.273 --> 35:10.983
You're just a karmi and a sense enjoyer.

35:11.818 --> 35:13.861
You wanna make him
into a gross materialist

35:13.945 --> 35:16.655
when he's living in the spiritual world.

35:18.325 --> 35:20.910
And also he's our best recruiter.

35:20.994 --> 35:23.412
l mean, he really can close.

35:23.497 --> 35:26.332
So l'm confused. Why did we just do that?

35:26.875 --> 35:29.084
Because you're going to stay away from him

35:29.169 --> 35:32.963
and let him be happy
in the light of Krishna consciousness.

35:34.758 --> 35:37.676
You thought l was some confused little girl?

35:38.678 --> 35:41.096
l'm trading the only thing l have.

35:42.682 --> 35:44.517
But you already gave it away.

35:50.649 --> 35:52.358
Stay away from him.

35:57.781 --> 35:59.532
What do l do about the script?

36:00.450 --> 36:02.201
Tell him the truth.

36:04.955 --> 36:06.622
That always works.

36:30.605 --> 36:32.064
You're drunk.

36:32.649 --> 36:34.358
And you left work at lunch.

36:34.442 --> 36:36.819
Where the hell were you?

36:36.903 --> 36:38.529
You wanna get the rolling pin?

36:39.739 --> 36:40.823
What the hell?

36:40.907 --> 36:42.950
l wanna know where you were.

36:43.660 --> 36:45.995
l left work, l test-drove a Jaguar,

36:46.079 --> 36:48.706
had a drink with Joan,
drove around some more and dropped it off.

36:48.790 --> 36:50.666
And you never thought to call me?

36:50.750 --> 36:52.293
Why did you want me to think that?

36:52.377 --> 36:53.711
Calm the hell down.

36:53.795 --> 36:55.588
l put a plate in the oven for you

36:55.672 --> 36:57.715
and sat here like an idiot,
waiting for someone

36:57.799 --> 36:59.925
who doesn't give a shit about anybody.

37:04.055 --> 37:05.848
-You like to get mad.
-No, l don't.

37:05.932 --> 37:08.726
-That's what gets you going.
-That is not what this is.

37:08.810 --> 37:10.436
Now sit down!

37:10.520 --> 37:12.855
You're gonna eat dinner with me.

37:40.175 --> 37:41.717
Do you want any cheese?

37:42.594 --> 37:45.471
-No. Do you want...
-l'll clean it up later.

37:54.648 --> 37:56.482
You used to love your work.

37:57.233 --> 37:59.526
Well, it's different there now.

38:01.154 --> 38:03.697
You loved it before you ever met me.

38:10.330 --> 38:14.333
My mother is not a good nurse
and he hides his symptoms.

38:15.627 --> 38:17.169
He's a rugged chap.

38:17.253 --> 38:20.923
l do think more than ever
we should pay them a visit at Christmas.

38:21.007 --> 38:22.967
Or l could just take Nigel.

38:23.051 --> 38:25.260
Certainly we can afford that.

38:34.854 --> 38:38.232
l shouldn't be sharing this,
but l truly don't want you to go.

38:39.859 --> 38:44.279
You see, Edwin's left Jaguar.

38:44.364 --> 38:46.657
That's why she left in a hurry.

38:47.200 --> 38:49.535
lf he had been sacked,
he'd have lost his visa.

38:49.995 --> 38:53.956
Yes, well, it allowed Jaguar
to come crawling back to me.

38:55.125 --> 38:59.753
The firm can't do it without me
and l shan't spend another Christmas alone.

39:01.881 --> 39:03.298
Darling.

39:03.383 --> 39:06.552
l'm so happy for you, so proud.

39:07.721 --> 39:10.472
Of course we'll be here by your side.

39:10.557 --> 39:13.267
Christmas in New York will do just fine.

39:31.077 --> 39:32.161
Don't get excited.

39:32.537 --> 39:35.414
Well, get excited, but they're not from me.

39:36.666 --> 39:38.125
Thank you for delivering them.

39:38.209 --> 39:41.003
l had to. The girl in reception
is too scared to bring them back.

39:41.087 --> 39:43.422
l also had to sign for them
and tip handsomely.

39:48.011 --> 39:49.428
Do you want a tip, too?

39:52.932 --> 39:56.977
How many times have l left you alone
with a card from another man?

40:14.788 --> 40:16.455
Hare Krishna.

40:17.373 --> 40:19.708
Great to see you. Well?

40:19.793 --> 40:21.877
l've been meditating on the idea
that you have good news,

40:21.961 --> 40:24.171
especially since you called me so fast.

40:24.255 --> 40:28.926
Then l realized it's probably not,
since you wouldn't tell me over the phone.

40:31.638 --> 40:35.099
l have news, but it's complicated.

40:36.309 --> 40:39.394
They loved it. They said it was one
of the best scripts they had ever read.

40:39.979 --> 40:41.146
Who?

40:41.231 --> 40:44.233
The reader at Mike Weinblatt's office.

40:44.317 --> 40:45.651
But he apparently can't give it to Mike

40:45.735 --> 40:48.278
or anyone over there
because of legal reasons.

40:48.363 --> 40:51.073
And you can never call him
because they've had some lawsuits,

40:51.157 --> 40:54.660
but he said you have a future
and l agree with him.

40:55.203 --> 40:57.454
Did you tell him l'll get a lawyer?
l'll sign anything they want.

40:57.539 --> 41:00.999
Yes, but he was firmly discouraging
in every way

41:01.084 --> 41:03.919
except in his unbridled enthusiasm
for the writing.

41:04.003 --> 41:05.712
Really? What did he say?

41:05.797 --> 41:07.256
Can l talk to him?
Does he want to talk to me?

41:07.340 --> 41:08.715
Never.

41:08.842 --> 41:10.008
But...

41:12.846 --> 41:15.764
ln this envelope is your future.

41:16.558 --> 41:18.350
This is your destiny.

41:19.477 --> 41:20.519
ls it a contract?

41:20.645 --> 41:22.521
They're not interested.

41:24.524 --> 41:25.774
But l am.

41:27.902 --> 41:30.696
This is $500 and a ticket to Los Angeles.

41:31.030 --> 41:34.074
l want you to leave the Krishnas
and go out there and try.

41:35.660 --> 41:36.869
l don't think Lakshmi...

41:36.953 --> 41:40.789
l'm not giving you this unless you promise

41:40.874 --> 41:43.083
to leave your things and go from here.

41:43.793 --> 41:45.836
l don't have any things.

41:47.088 --> 41:49.339
Good. This is all you need.

41:52.135 --> 41:54.511
You don't understand
what it's like out there.

41:54.637 --> 41:56.930
This failure, this life...

41:58.558 --> 42:02.269
lt'll all seem
like it happened to someone else.

42:02.353 --> 42:04.730
Harry, you don't understand Lakshmi.

42:06.024 --> 42:10.360
lf you go back there,
you'll never be strong enough to go.

42:10.445 --> 42:13.363
And then she'll try and talk you out of it.
And what does that tell you?

42:13.448 --> 42:17.409
lt's $500. You can call her on the way
from Philly or something.

42:41.893 --> 42:45.687
You know, all these people said
they'd do something for me.

42:45.772 --> 42:47.981
You're the first one who did.

42:51.402 --> 42:52.778
Break a leg.

43:00.703 --> 43:03.288
Everyone's assembling
for the announcement.

43:03.373 --> 43:06.124
Well, there's a little bad news
to go with the good.

43:07.627 --> 43:09.878
Mohawk's machinists are going on strike.

43:09.963 --> 43:11.797
Despite the fact that they're flying,

43:11.965 --> 43:13.757
they're suspending their advertising.

43:14.300 --> 43:17.302
They made so much money all summer
as scabs.

43:18.346 --> 43:20.389
-What's going on?
-Mohawk's on strike.

43:20.473 --> 43:22.099
They're suspending all work.

43:22.183 --> 43:23.225
They're not leaving the agency,

43:23.309 --> 43:24.893
but what they save by cutting the ad budget

43:24.978 --> 43:26.979
goes straight to the bottom line,
and it's the end of the year.

43:27.272 --> 43:29.731
Then there'll be no bonuses.

43:29.816 --> 43:30.899
No!

43:32.485 --> 43:35.487
No Christmas bonuses three years in a row?

43:35.571 --> 43:36.780
l know.

43:37.740 --> 43:40.826
They're going to be working
all through the holidays on Jaguar.

43:40.910 --> 43:43.620
Fine. Just the partners will defer.

43:45.331 --> 43:46.623
Even the junior partners?

43:46.708 --> 43:48.750
Yes, till the end of January.

43:50.253 --> 43:52.254
That's prudent.

43:52.338 --> 43:54.589
Well, here we go.

43:54.674 --> 43:56.717
Don, you up to joining us?

44:07.979 --> 44:09.521
Lane, go ahead.

44:10.356 --> 44:13.442
Well, we have a few announcements,

44:13.526 --> 44:15.235
the first of which is

44:15.320 --> 44:19.781
that we have received some bad news
from Mohawk Airlines

44:19.866 --> 44:23.243
that they will be suspending
their work indefinitely.

44:24.620 --> 44:28.540
This puts significant financial strain
on the company.

44:30.626 --> 44:35.881
lt was our plan to distribute
Christmas bonuses this year,

44:37.884 --> 44:43.722
but quite selflessly the partners
have elected to forego their share

44:43.806 --> 44:48.894
in the interests of rewarding the staff
for a job well done.

44:52.648 --> 44:55.901
You're all getting Christmas bonuses
and we aren't.

45:00.531 --> 45:05.494
Now, understand
that the financial straddling required

45:05.578 --> 45:08.372
is for a very good reason.

45:08.456 --> 45:10.999
We've been included
in an elite group of agencies

45:11.084 --> 45:13.210
invited to pitch Jaguar cars.

45:14.754 --> 45:17.214
So congratulations.

45:21.344 --> 45:22.511
Anything else?

45:22.595 --> 45:24.096
Yes, actually, l'd like to say something.

45:25.014 --> 45:26.348
Would you?

45:28.434 --> 45:31.186
Last year at this time,
whether you knew it or not,

45:31.270 --> 45:34.272
the survival of this company was on the line.

45:34.399 --> 45:36.441
l look at the faces in this room
who have given their all

45:36.526 --> 45:39.528
to this tenuous recovery and l say,

45:41.114 --> 45:44.157
prepare to take a great leap forward.

45:45.034 --> 45:48.995
Prepare to swim the English Channel
and then drown in champagne.

45:51.416 --> 45:54.668
There are six weekends
between now and the pitch.

45:55.670 --> 45:58.380
We are going to spend them all here.

45:58.464 --> 45:59.673
We will celebrate Christmas here.

45:59.757 --> 46:01.216
We will ring in the new year together.

46:01.300 --> 46:05.470
And in the end, we will represent Jaguar,
and it will be worth it.

46:06.264 --> 46:07.556
Every agency on Madison Avenue

46:07.640 --> 46:10.767
is defined by the moment they got their car.

46:11.644 --> 46:15.814
When we land Jaguar,
the world will know we've arrived.

46:24.782 --> 46:26.658
Creative, in my office.
