WEBVTT

00:04.300 --> 00:05.900
It takes about four months
To recover.

00:05.900 --> 00:06.800
Henry: i understand.

00:06.800 --> 00:08.600
Along with the right lobe
Of your liver,

00:08.600 --> 00:12.100
We also remove veins,
The bile duct, and arteries.

00:12.300 --> 00:14.200
We may also
Have to remove part

00:14.200 --> 00:16.900
Of your saphenous vein in your
Leg for connecting the liver.

00:17.100 --> 00:17.900
Right.

00:18.400 --> 00:21.000
Pain is a certainty.
Infections are not uncommon.

00:21.000 --> 00:21.900
Pneumonia is a risk.

00:22.100 --> 00:23.300
Are you trying
To frighten me?

00:23.600 --> 00:24.500
Inform you.

00:26.200 --> 00:28.200
Blood clots in the legs
Can develop.

00:28.200 --> 00:29.900
Injuries to the spleen
Or bowel

00:29.900 --> 00:31.000
Or even death.

00:31.300 --> 00:33.400
You're saying that you don't
Want to do this.

00:36.800 --> 00:39.100
I gave your father
A perfect liver two years ago.

00:39.100 --> 00:40.600
His response was to drink

00:40.600 --> 00:42.600
And to mismanage
His antirejection drugs.

00:42.600 --> 00:43.600
It'll be different
This time.

00:46.400 --> 00:47.300
He'll be different.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
I'm sorry, henry.

00:50.700 --> 00:52.000
I know you want
To do this,

00:52.400 --> 00:54.400
But i can't accept you
As a living donor.

00:59.100 --> 01:00.200
Kate: look at you.

01:03.800 --> 01:05.099
What's the matter?
You don't like it?

01:05.400 --> 01:07.600
Are you kidding me?
Mom, it's butt ugly.

01:10.800 --> 01:12.200
Maybe you just don't
Like the bow.

01:12.400 --> 01:13.900
I just want
To send it back.

01:15.600 --> 01:17.100
So, what are you gonna wear
To the dance?

01:20.000 --> 01:21.300
[ coughs ]
I think i'm getting sick.

01:23.700 --> 01:24.900
Should i take
Your temperature?

01:25.400 --> 01:27.700
Mom, i just don't
Feel good, okay?

01:27.700 --> 01:29.800
Please? Please?
Just...

01:31.300 --> 01:32.300
Okay.

01:38.800 --> 01:40.300
All: thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done

01:40.500 --> 01:41.800
On earth as in heaven.

01:46.900 --> 01:48.200
Give us this day
Our daily bread.

01:48.400 --> 01:51.300
Forgive us our sins
As we will forgive...

01:53.800 --> 01:55.900
Any word
On mrs. Hartog's blood work?

01:57.500 --> 01:59.400
I'll ask dr. Grant
The next time he rounds.

02:00.600 --> 02:02.400
Dr. Griffith,
Nice to see you.

02:02.400 --> 02:04.600
Mrs. Hartog.
Hello.

02:05.400 --> 02:06.300
Come pray with us?

02:07.500 --> 02:08.900
Uh...

02:09.600 --> 02:10.800
Actually, i'm rounding.

02:11.000 --> 02:14.800
But i'll come back later
If you're still up for it then.

02:15.000 --> 02:15.800
Okay.

02:19.500 --> 02:21.200
"if you're still
Up for it"?

02:21.500 --> 02:22.500
What?

02:22.500 --> 02:25.000
They're praying.
They're not playing softball.

02:26.300 --> 02:27.100
Hey, chief.

02:27.100 --> 02:27.800
Mary.

02:29.200 --> 02:31.500
Someone left their minivan
In my parking spot.

02:32.400 --> 02:33.500
I ride a motorcycle.

02:33.500 --> 02:35.800
Good.
Always looking for new donors.

02:36.400 --> 02:37.100
How's gilliam?

02:37.500 --> 02:38.700
Liver function
Is very low.

02:38.700 --> 02:39.600
Mr. Hartog?

02:40.200 --> 02:42.500
Dialysis has stabilized
His kidneys.

02:42.500 --> 02:43.200
Heart function?

02:43.700 --> 02:44.400
Decreasing.

02:44.700 --> 02:45.800
That's because
Of the kidneys.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.100
I know. But once we transplant
Him, he'll recover.

02:48.100 --> 02:50.500
He has the most unusual
Antibodies i've ever seen.

02:51.000 --> 02:51.600
I know.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.600
So i wouldn't get their hopes up
About her blood matching his.

02:55.600 --> 02:56.400
I'm not.

02:56.400 --> 02:58.200
All those transfusions leave
Their mark.

02:58.200 --> 03:00.400
I know, and i explained all this
To mr. Hartog's wife.

03:00.400 --> 03:01.800
She's still certain
She's a match.

03:02.700 --> 03:04.100
How many people
Did you let in here?

03:04.100 --> 03:05.200
It's a prayer circle.

03:05.200 --> 03:06.600
It's not hygienic.

03:12.500 --> 03:13.300
You want this one?

03:14.800 --> 03:15.700
I can do this case?

03:17.000 --> 03:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:27.700 --> 03:28.500
Dr. Grant.

03:28.500 --> 03:29.900
I placed your father
On the list.

03:29.900 --> 03:31.800
He's been on that list
For nearly a year.

03:31.800 --> 03:33.800
If a matching organ comes
In from a brain-dead --

03:33.800 --> 03:34.600
It won't, okay?

03:34.600 --> 03:36.200
He's no longer
A good candidate.

03:38.100 --> 03:40.100
I know you want to help
Your father, henry,

03:40.600 --> 03:42.500
But i can't put your life
At risk for a man

03:42.500 --> 03:45.300
Who might choose to destroy
The very gift that you give him.

03:53.200 --> 03:54.100
Man: eleanora!

03:57.700 --> 03:58.700
Eleanora, you in there?

04:01.600 --> 04:03.400
I don't have it. I'm sorry.
I still don't have it.

04:04.600 --> 04:06.000
I'll get it, i promise.

04:34.200 --> 04:35.600
<i>Man on p.a.:
dr. Hanley, please call...</i>

04:36.100 --> 04:37.300
Why do we have to be here?

04:37.700 --> 04:39.100
I could take you
To school, honey,

04:39.100 --> 04:40.300
If you're feeling
Better now.

04:41.200 --> 04:42.500
You hear about
The jane doe?

04:42.900 --> 04:45.300
She's not a good candidate
For organ donation.

04:45.700 --> 04:47.100
Let me be the judge
Of that.

04:47.100 --> 04:49.400
The coroner's on me
About performing the autopsy.

04:49.400 --> 04:50.800
Have you finished
Brain-death tests yet?

04:50.800 --> 04:52.100
No.
Is her blood work back?

04:52.100 --> 04:52.900
Not yet.

04:52.900 --> 04:55.200
Hold off on the declaration
Till the tests come in.

04:55.200 --> 04:58.200
This is a murder case. There's
No donor card, next of kin --

04:58.200 --> 05:02.500
What if i told you they have
A lead on her husband in iraq?

05:02.900 --> 05:04.400
Is her husband in iraq?

05:04.600 --> 05:06.200
They're still trying
To track down his unit.

05:08.100 --> 05:08.800
Fine.

05:08.800 --> 05:10.100
I'll hold off
For an hour or two

05:10.100 --> 05:11.800
While they find
Mr. Doe's unit.

05:17.400 --> 05:18.400
What?

05:19.200 --> 05:20.700
You lied to that doctor.

05:21.800 --> 05:24.000
I think he knew
I was lying, thea.

05:24.300 --> 05:25.800
But, still, you lied.

05:25.800 --> 05:28.200
Sometimes
In complicated situations,

05:28.200 --> 05:30.000
Adults agree
To stretch the truth.

05:31.600 --> 05:32.400
Thea?

05:34.700 --> 05:36.600
Dad, i'm sick.

05:36.900 --> 05:38.800
I mean,
I'm really, really sick.

05:43.500 --> 05:44.500
It's not swollen.

05:45.200 --> 05:47.400
It feels swollen.

05:47.400 --> 05:48.000
Hmm.

05:48.600 --> 05:49.700
I'm nauseous.

05:51.200 --> 05:52.300
Open your mouth.

05:52.300 --> 05:53.200
Daddy.

05:53.200 --> 05:54.400
Open your mouth.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.200
Your mother tells me your new
Dress is very beautiful.

05:59.800 --> 06:02.300
She also tells me
You're displeased with the fact

06:02.300 --> 06:04.300
That she's going to be
A chaperone at the dance.

06:04.300 --> 06:06.500
I trust you understand

06:06.500 --> 06:08.700
That you even being allowed
To go to the dance

06:08.700 --> 06:10.600
Is us being lenient.

06:12.500 --> 06:13.500
Let me talk to your mom.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.600
She's f-a-k-i-n-g.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.200
She can spell.

06:22.400 --> 06:23.900
Thea:
I'm not faking, daddy.

06:25.200 --> 06:27.200
I thought you were taking
A couple of weeks off.

06:27.200 --> 06:28.900
I have two days left
On my shift.

06:29.100 --> 06:31.100
Oh, so you're just gonna let
Thea fake sick

06:31.100 --> 06:32.100
So she can hang out
With you?

06:32.100 --> 06:33.900
You want to be
Semiformal chaperone?

06:34.200 --> 06:35.000
I'm on call.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.900
So you can't drive car pool
To this week's piano lessons

06:37.900 --> 06:39.600
Or figure out a way to get

06:39.600 --> 06:41.100
To tomorrow's orthodontist
Appointment?

06:41.100 --> 06:42.100
Okay.
Point taken.

06:43.400 --> 06:44.600
She's having a tough week.

06:44.800 --> 06:46.800
I thought mother/daughter time
Would be a good thing.

06:46.800 --> 06:48.300
You're doing a procurement.

06:48.300 --> 06:51.600
It's a jane doe. We'll just be
Sitting around here all day.

06:54.000 --> 06:54.800
Kate...

06:58.700 --> 06:59.500
I hope...

07:01.900 --> 07:04.500
I mean, what happened
A few days ago --

07:04.500 --> 07:07.400
What happened is that
We had sex, nathaniel.

07:10.900 --> 07:11.700
Nothing more than that.

07:25.900 --> 07:26.900
Okay, i'm faking.

07:27.800 --> 07:29.100
Okay.

07:29.700 --> 07:31.900
I do not want you
To take me to the dance.

07:32.100 --> 07:34.300
I swear, i can handle
Going by myself.

07:34.300 --> 07:36.400
Judging by what you did,
Sweetheart, you can't.

07:37.100 --> 07:39.000
Your jane doe was
A prostitute.

07:39.100 --> 07:39.900
Oh.

07:40.200 --> 07:41.900
Might not want to tell
Her husband that.

07:42.500 --> 07:44.600
Well, wait.

07:45.600 --> 07:47.200
If i find another hospital
To take her,

07:47.200 --> 07:48.400
Will you hold off
On the coroner?

07:48.400 --> 07:49.200
We're filling up.

07:49.200 --> 07:51.400
It's hard to leave
A dead patient in a needed bed.

07:51.600 --> 07:54.900
I've seen a coroner move in
Too fast on a jane doe.

07:54.900 --> 07:57.400
When the family learns they
Might have donated her organs --

07:57.400 --> 07:59.100
Given the fact
That we have no consent,

07:59.100 --> 08:01.000
We might be liable
For the lawsuit.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.100
If she's a viable
Organ donor,

08:02.100 --> 08:04.300
It would be such a shame
To hand her over to the coroner.

08:04.600 --> 08:06.900
She's clean.
She's perfectly clean.

08:07.100 --> 08:09.000
Right. Hooker
With a heart of gold.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.900
You got to give me an hour,
All right? Promise me?

08:10.900 --> 08:14.100
I will have her off your hands
In an hour, christopher.

08:42.400 --> 08:43.299
Morning.

08:43.700 --> 08:45.100
Morning.
How did you sleep?

08:45.100 --> 08:46.600
Okay.
Where'd you sleep?

08:48.700 --> 08:50.200
[ sighs ]
I'm so sorry, jessica.

08:50.200 --> 08:52.500
I worked late last night.
I slept in the office.

08:52.700 --> 08:53.600
You slept here?

08:53.600 --> 08:54.200
I did.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.600
Could we just --
Tonight, could we --

08:57.600 --> 08:58.100
Tonight?

08:59.100 --> 08:59.700
Maybe.

09:00.200 --> 09:01.000
I'll let you know.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.300
Tom:
Firemen and matches.

09:21.900 --> 09:23.200
Cops and hookers.

09:25.800 --> 09:26.900
Surgeons and cigarettes.

09:28.900 --> 09:30.700
[ chuckles ] it's been a long
Time, dr. Grant.

09:31.900 --> 09:33.300
You don't remember my name,
Do you?

09:35.200 --> 09:36.500
But you want to call me
Cleveland, right?

09:37.600 --> 09:38.300
No.

09:38.300 --> 09:40.200
12 years ago,
You used to call me that

09:40.800 --> 09:41.800
For 10 months straight.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.100
It's a tradition.

09:44.300 --> 09:46.800
For 10 months, i would look you
Straight in the eye

09:46.800 --> 09:49.400
And i would say,
"my name is..."

09:49.400 --> 09:50.700
Tom.
Tom jonas.

09:51.600 --> 09:54.600
From cleveland, ohio.
Fellow in liver-kidney, 1995.

09:56.200 --> 09:56.900
[ chuckles ]
There you go.

09:58.900 --> 10:00.300
So, you here to learn
A new procedure?

10:00.500 --> 10:01.400
Here to learn what?

10:01.400 --> 10:02.800
Shadow me
On the new german heart pump?

10:02.800 --> 10:04.700
We were using that pump
At stanford

10:04.700 --> 10:06.100
Three months
Before you tried it out here.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.500
We introduced it to you.

10:08.500 --> 10:09.700
Right.
That's right.

10:11.400 --> 10:13.900
Well, i got to tell you,
I have no idea why you're here.

10:14.800 --> 10:18.500
Well, you took bart jacobs' job,
And i took yours.

10:32.100 --> 10:32.900
Hey.

10:32.900 --> 10:34.300
Hey. I could have come
To the house.

10:34.500 --> 10:36.800
Oh, no.
It's good for me to get out.

10:37.200 --> 10:39.700
I'm already starting
To drive janet out of her mind.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.100
Thanks.

10:44.900 --> 10:48.900
So, you made a deal in exchange
For my chairmanship?

10:48.900 --> 10:49.700
Mm-hmm.

10:49.900 --> 10:50.800
Why didn't you tell me?

10:51.300 --> 10:52.300
It wasn't your deal.

10:52.500 --> 10:55.100
Tom jonas didn't last 10 months
With us.

10:55.300 --> 10:59.300
He's smart, dependable,
A great gut guy.

10:59.300 --> 11:00.600
Yeah.

11:00.900 --> 11:02.200
August '95?

11:03.000 --> 11:06.200
Edgar harrison is presented
With biliary atresia and h.i.v.

11:06.200 --> 11:07.500
Jonas refuses to operate.

11:07.900 --> 11:09.400
October '95 --

11:09.800 --> 11:13.200
Tries to turn away a potential
Liver recipient because he's 66.

11:13.200 --> 11:16.600
Nate, the board is afraid
Of the risks you take.

11:16.600 --> 11:18.400
We can't not take risks.

11:18.400 --> 11:21.500
Let's just say the rest of the
Staff started behaving like you.

11:21.500 --> 11:24.700
Let's just say the death rate
Started going up dramatically.

11:24.700 --> 11:26.400
We are the pre-eminent
Transplant hospital

11:26.400 --> 11:27.900
In the country, bart --
In the world.

11:27.900 --> 11:30.200
And we're just as dependent
On federal funding

11:30.200 --> 11:31.500
As the least reputable.

11:32.700 --> 11:33.300
Nope.

11:33.300 --> 11:34.900
You need tom jonas,

11:35.200 --> 11:37.200
And tom jonas needs you.

11:40.000 --> 11:40.800
Well...

11:42.300 --> 11:44.100
You'll figure out
A way to live with him.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
<i>Woman on p.a.:
dr. Garvey...</i>

11:50.000 --> 11:51.300
<i>dr. Garvey...</i>

11:53.400 --> 11:54.700
Ah.

11:54.900 --> 11:56.200
Simon: excuse me.
Yeah?

11:56.700 --> 11:58.200
You must be dr. Jonas.

11:58.400 --> 11:59.600
Yes, i am.

11:59.900 --> 12:01.500
I'm simon griffith,
First-year fellow.

12:01.500 --> 12:02.900
It's nice to meet you.
How you doing?

12:02.900 --> 12:04.100
Good, good.
Hey, you got kids.

12:04.800 --> 12:06.700
Listen, i'm working
With a kidney patient

12:06.700 --> 12:08.000
Who's got congestive
Heart failure.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
I know that's one
Of your specialties,

12:09.000 --> 12:10.600
And i thought maybe
You could do a consult.

12:10.600 --> 12:13.700
Oh, wow. I'm sure dr. Grant
Would love to oversee that one.

12:13.900 --> 12:15.200
Dr. Grant.
Yeah.

12:17.600 --> 12:19.200
Listen, i know how it is.

12:19.400 --> 12:21.100
I used to be
A fellow here, too.

12:21.800 --> 12:23.000
Dr. Grant can be tricky.

12:23.300 --> 12:24.900
Half the time,
I just wanted to quit.

12:24.900 --> 12:26.100
How did you make it through?

12:26.400 --> 12:27.400
I didn't.

12:29.700 --> 12:31.900
Well, it's good to know
I'll be working for somebody

12:31.900 --> 12:33.400
Who calls me something
Other than "vancouver."

12:34.500 --> 12:36.300
If you're vancouver
To dr. Grant,

12:36.300 --> 12:37.500
You're vancouver to me.

12:37.900 --> 12:40.200
I see you've met
Our neighbor to the north.

12:40.200 --> 12:41.300
Oh, vancouver?
Yeah.

12:41.800 --> 12:43.500
Check on mr. Hartog's
Heart functions.

12:43.700 --> 12:45.600
Let me know if you're thinking
About upping his drugs

12:45.600 --> 12:47.000
Or going to mechanical assist.

12:48.100 --> 12:49.700
You gave the new guy
A patient?

12:49.700 --> 12:50.800
They won't find a match.

12:51.200 --> 12:53.900
Hey, is that your minivan
In my parking spot?

12:54.400 --> 12:56.000
Which minivan?
Which parking spot?

12:58.700 --> 13:00.400
I need you to accept
A potential donor.

13:01.700 --> 13:02.600
Kate?

13:05.400 --> 13:06.500
Tom!

13:06.800 --> 13:09.000
Oh, my god. Tom!

13:09.000 --> 13:09.800
Wow.

13:09.800 --> 13:11.500
I heard a rumor.
You heard a rumor?

13:11.800 --> 13:13.600
It's true.
Wow.

13:13.600 --> 13:14.900
Why aren't you
Back in school?

13:14.900 --> 13:15.700
Dad, not now.

13:15.700 --> 13:18.500
You got married, right?
Yeah, yeah.

13:18.500 --> 13:19.700
Kate, your potential donor?

13:20.200 --> 13:23.500
Oh, tom, wow.
They're beautiful.

13:24.100 --> 13:25.200
Yeah.
Thank you.

13:25.400 --> 13:27.400
And if you're thea,
Then i'm really old.

13:27.600 --> 13:28.800
I don't get it.

13:28.800 --> 13:29.800
Kate, i'm rounding.

13:30.300 --> 13:32.200
Jane doe -- county's giving me
A hard time,

13:32.200 --> 13:33.500
And i don't have
Next of kin yet.

13:33.700 --> 13:35.100
The first time
I met your mother,

13:35.100 --> 13:37.000
She was fresh off the bus
From iowa.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.900
Not exactly
Fresh off the bus.

13:39.100 --> 13:42.000
Nate, don't be so --
Just keep her at st. Jude's

13:42.000 --> 13:43.500
Until i can figure out
Who her next of kin is.

13:43.700 --> 13:44.900
Thank you, nathaniel.

13:45.300 --> 13:47.500
Tom, so good to see you.
Good to see you.

13:48.500 --> 13:49.300
Thea: bye, daddy.

13:50.500 --> 13:52.900
It's your turn to pick up thea
Tomorrow, nathaniel.

13:54.400 --> 13:57.500
What?

14:07.400 --> 14:09.600
Kate: lock the doors and wait.
I won't be but a minute.

14:10.500 --> 14:12.200
And don't tell your dad
I brought you here, okay?

14:51.400 --> 14:53.300
Nate: so we're still waiting
On kidneys

14:53.300 --> 14:56.000
For hartog, tayback,
And perkins.

14:56.700 --> 14:58.500
What about mr. Espiotis?

14:58.500 --> 14:59.900
He passed earlier today.

15:00.500 --> 15:01.800
Okay.
Liver candidates.

15:02.200 --> 15:03.900
Arthur gilliam is
Our most acute,

15:03.900 --> 15:06.300
But he's 1b on the list
Due to his past behavior.

15:06.300 --> 15:08.100
Isn't his son
Wanting to donate?

15:08.100 --> 15:09.700
I'm not accepting that.
And why is that?

15:10.400 --> 15:13.900
Heart. We got three adults
And one pediatric in the i.c.u.

15:13.900 --> 15:16.100
We're gonna put mr. Foster on
An echmo later this afternoon.

15:16.100 --> 15:18.100
Vancouver,
You can assist on that.

15:20.500 --> 15:22.300
This guy's son is
A perfect match.

15:22.300 --> 15:24.100
The guy's
A recidivist alcoholic

15:24.100 --> 15:25.900
Who drank
After his last transplant.

15:25.900 --> 15:27.200
Yeah,
But if his son --

15:27.200 --> 15:28.300
If the kid
Has complications --

15:28.300 --> 15:30.200
Donor risk of death these days
Is like what,

15:30.200 --> 15:31.300
0.2%?

15:31.300 --> 15:33.700
Any risk in this case is
Too much risk.

15:40.200 --> 15:42.200
Don't you think if his son
Gave him a second chance

15:42.200 --> 15:44.000
That mr. Gilliam
Might turn around?

15:52.700 --> 15:53.700
Nathaniel?

15:54.900 --> 15:56.200
Nathaniel.

16:03.500 --> 16:06.300
"my name is eleanora.
My mother calls me nor.

16:06.300 --> 16:09.000
"we live above what used to be
My father's tailor store.

16:09.500 --> 16:13.000
"my father makes fine coats
And caps for ladies in our town.

16:13.200 --> 16:15.800
The stores got dusty
Since we had to close it down."

16:17.300 --> 16:19.000
It's kind of stupid.

16:20.100 --> 16:21.400
Well,
It's for younger kids.

16:21.900 --> 16:23.800
But you liked it, right?

16:25.000 --> 16:26.200
It was my favorite book.

16:26.700 --> 16:27.600
Why's that?

16:28.900 --> 16:29.800
Uh...

16:30.700 --> 16:33.600
This fatherless girl has
All this ingenuity.

16:33.600 --> 16:35.700
Basically constructs a life
For herself

16:35.700 --> 16:36.900
Out of what's around her.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.700
If it's your favorite, how come
You never read it to me?

16:40.900 --> 16:41.700
I did.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.800
Well, i don't remember you
Reading it to me.

16:51.700 --> 16:55.100
"but every night i sneak inside
And see what might be left.

16:55.100 --> 16:58.000
And if i find a piece of work,
Size and shape and heft..."

17:01.900 --> 17:03.700
Got mrs. Hartog's
Results back.

17:03.700 --> 17:04.400
And?

17:04.800 --> 17:05.900
You want me
To tell them?

17:06.300 --> 17:07.400
I got it.

17:08.800 --> 17:09.700
How are you gonna
Tell her?

17:11.599 --> 17:12.400
What?

17:17.500 --> 17:19.099
I...

17:19.099 --> 17:21.300
I was just so sure.

17:21.400 --> 17:24.000
I was just --

17:25.700 --> 17:28.600
I was just --

17:30.200 --> 17:32.500
Can i take the test again?

17:32.500 --> 17:33.600
Excuse me?

17:33.600 --> 17:34.600
The test.

17:34.600 --> 17:37.200
Maybe there's been
A mistake.

17:37.300 --> 17:40.100
Mrs. Hartog,
There's been no mistake.

17:40.100 --> 17:42.800
Please.

17:42.900 --> 17:45.600
Just let me please
Take the test again.

17:48.100 --> 17:50.700
Mrs. Hartog,
Take some comfort in the fact

17:50.800 --> 17:53.800
That had your husband not had
So many transfusions,

17:53.900 --> 17:55.400
You'd actually be a match.

17:55.400 --> 17:57.300
Comfort?

17:59.200 --> 18:03.200
The fact is, y-your husband's
Blood type is extremely rare

18:03.300 --> 18:05.700
And the chance of finding
A match is very small.

18:10.500 --> 18:13.500
Well, we are going to increase
His digoxin.

18:13.600 --> 18:16.700
That should -- that should help
Keep us away from...

18:16.800 --> 18:19.600
Hey.

18:19.600 --> 18:22.100
...stenting him.

18:24.100 --> 18:26.000
I'm so sorry.

18:28.400 --> 18:32.600
It's okay.

18:32.600 --> 18:35.400
Kate: okay.

18:35.400 --> 18:37.400
So you were able to get
The address from the librarian?

18:37.500 --> 18:38.800
Good.

18:38.800 --> 18:43.000
So she's catholic. Okay.
Middle-class.

18:45.300 --> 18:48.500
Okay.
And when did the father die?

18:48.500 --> 18:51.100
Okay.

18:51.100 --> 18:54.500
Has anyone mentioned
Organ donation?

18:54.500 --> 18:57.100
Please tell her
I'm on my way.

18:57.200 --> 18:58.400
Thank you.

18:58.400 --> 19:02.400
What's "swingy" mean?

19:02.500 --> 19:04.200
Swingy?

19:04.200 --> 19:06.700
Mm-hmm.

19:06.800 --> 19:10.200
Uh, i don't know.
You know, swingy.

19:10.300 --> 19:14.800
I don't know.
Uh, pretty, unusual.

19:14.800 --> 19:17.700
Pretty and unusual.

19:17.700 --> 19:20.300
Yeah. Like you.

19:33.800 --> 19:38.800
<i>dr. Grant to recovery.</i>

19:57.300 --> 19:59.000
What are you doing?

19:59.000 --> 20:00.800
Nothing.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.900
I'll be fine, mom.
Don't worry about it.

20:12.900 --> 20:15.500
I'll be right back.

20:15.500 --> 20:16.900
Okay.

20:21.700 --> 20:23.400
I brought you
Some information

20:23.400 --> 20:25.400
On organ donation
And transplantation.

20:27.300 --> 20:31.200
Now? You want to ask me
For her organs now?

20:31.200 --> 20:34.100
I'm sorry.
I know how this must seem.

20:34.100 --> 20:36.000
I just found out my daughter
Was murdered.

20:36.100 --> 20:37.200
I don't want to upset you.

20:37.300 --> 20:38.900
That she was
A prostitute.

20:38.900 --> 20:40.900
And you come to me like
Some kind of a vulture,

20:40.900 --> 20:42.400
You come to me?

20:42.400 --> 20:46.600
I'm only here
To inform you of the option.

20:51.500 --> 20:55.900
Mrs. Snow, i know this is
A terrible time.

21:01.100 --> 21:04.600
If there's anything
I can do for you...

21:13.700 --> 21:16.000
It all went by so fast.

21:16.100 --> 21:18.700
What?

21:20.700 --> 21:23.200
She was just --

21:23.200 --> 21:27.100
I mean,
She was just a little girl.

21:39.400 --> 21:41.800
It's such a waste.

21:44.500 --> 21:49.200
Such a waste of --
Of a life.

22:11.000 --> 22:15.100
Hey.
Have you seen mrs. Hartog?

22:15.100 --> 22:16.200
No.

22:16.200 --> 22:18.700
Yeah, she hasn't been around
For hours.

22:18.800 --> 22:20.100
And?

22:20.100 --> 22:22.400
The woman hasn't left
Her husband's side for a month.

22:22.500 --> 22:24.600
Now she hasn't been around
For hours?

22:24.600 --> 22:26.800
Hey, nathaniel.

22:26.900 --> 22:28.600
The kid's biopsy report
Looks great.

22:28.600 --> 22:29.700
So does his arteriogram.

22:29.700 --> 22:32.000
Nate: right.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.300
He's a perfect candidate.
Okay.

22:34.400 --> 22:36.500
Nadine:
Are you dr. Grant?
Yes.

22:36.500 --> 22:40.300
My name's nadine moore.
I'm henry gilliam's mother.

22:41.700 --> 22:44.700
My ex-husband drank.
He slept around.

22:44.700 --> 22:48.100
His cirrhosis,
His hepatitis are his doing.

22:48.100 --> 22:50.200
Well, then if we're in
Agreement, i think we should --

22:50.300 --> 22:52.600
Well, that's the thing.
We're not.

22:52.700 --> 22:54.600
As far as i'm concerned,

22:54.600 --> 22:57.600
I don't really care anymore
Whether arthur lives or dies,

22:57.600 --> 22:59.100
But my son...

22:59.200 --> 23:00.900
Thank you.

23:00.900 --> 23:03.700
...all his life,
More than anything else,

23:03.700 --> 23:05.100
He's wanted his father.

23:05.100 --> 23:06.400
Mrs. Moore --

23:06.400 --> 23:08.300
I've already lost
My husband.

23:08.400 --> 23:11.500
If i lose my son,
I have nothing.

23:11.500 --> 23:13.600
I understand.

23:13.700 --> 23:15.900
Despite that, dr. Grant --
Despite that,

23:16.000 --> 23:18.700
I want you to know
That i support my son's wishes.

23:20.400 --> 23:22.900
I want you to know that.

23:25.600 --> 23:28.200
Oh, mom told me to wait up here
For about an hour.

23:28.200 --> 23:30.400
This is arthur gilliam's
Latest c.t. Scan.

23:30.500 --> 23:32.000
His portal vein is useless.

23:32.100 --> 23:34.300
All the more reason to use
A cadaveric donor.

23:34.300 --> 23:36.500
Get a cadaver vein,
Attach it to the son's liver --

23:36.600 --> 23:37.900
You do it all the time.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.300
Jessica, do me a favor.
What is it?

23:39.300 --> 23:41.700
Would you buy thea a soda,
Please?

24:17.000 --> 24:18.700
I'll sign your forms now.

24:25.700 --> 24:27.600
Can i show you something?

24:27.600 --> 24:29.000
Of course.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.200
This is how she was.

24:37.300 --> 24:39.400
Do you understand?

24:41.900 --> 24:44.000
This is
How my daughter was.

24:45.700 --> 24:48.900
This is
How my daughter was.

24:51.100 --> 24:52.900
This is
How my daughter was.

24:54.800 --> 24:59.900
I don't ever want to...hear
From you again.

25:00.900 --> 25:03.500
I don't ever want to talk
About this again.

25:25.000 --> 25:25.800
I used to have that book --
About the girl

25:26.900 --> 25:29.200
Who makes her own dresses
And then magically travels

25:29.200 --> 25:31.200
To the place
She wants to wear them.

25:41.800 --> 25:43.700
I think it's true.

25:43.800 --> 25:46.400
We put on our uniform
And find our place.

25:46.400 --> 25:48.500
I mean, it was for me,
At least.

25:52.000 --> 25:55.500
Anyway,
We don't have to talk.

25:55.500 --> 25:57.600
It's not about her clothes.

25:57.600 --> 25:59.800
It's about a girl
Who finds her prince.

25:59.900 --> 26:02.300
Well,
That's just how it ends.

26:02.400 --> 26:05.000
Well, if that's how it ends,
Then that's what it's about.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.600
Do you think so?

26:07.700 --> 26:10.100
I do.

26:10.200 --> 26:13.700
I don't think every story
Is about its ending.

26:17.300 --> 26:20.400
Jessica, i'm so sorry.
I didn't expect you to babysit.

26:20.400 --> 26:22.500
She's not babysitting.
No problem.

26:22.600 --> 26:24.700
Thea, i need to get back
To my office.

26:24.700 --> 26:25.700
Okay.

26:34.000 --> 26:37.500
It's just -- i've been
In that room for so long.

26:37.500 --> 26:39.500
It never got to me before.

26:39.500 --> 26:41.800
The chances of your blood
Matching his are so small.

26:41.800 --> 26:45.100
It's not just that.
It's -- i gave up.

26:45.100 --> 26:47.600
I started thinking about
Everything i ever wanted --

26:47.600 --> 26:49.200
Children, travel --

26:49.300 --> 26:51.900
Like i wasn't gonna
Get them.

26:51.900 --> 26:54.500
So you took a break.
It's perfectly natural.

26:54.500 --> 26:57.500
But he can't.
He can't take a break from this.

26:57.500 --> 27:00.300
You know, i'm just
A first-year fellow.

27:00.300 --> 27:02.300
I was assigned
To your husband's case

27:02.400 --> 27:05.500
Because the chances of us
Finding a match aren't great.

27:05.500 --> 27:07.600
They assigned you
Because they --

27:07.600 --> 27:09.200
Because, my guess is,

27:09.200 --> 27:11.300
They didn't think
They'd transplant anytime soon.

27:15.100 --> 27:17.200
So, what does
"first-year fellow" mean?

27:17.200 --> 27:19.000
It means that this is
My trial period.

27:19.100 --> 27:21.100
Right.

27:21.100 --> 27:23.000
That i have a chance
To work here,

27:23.000 --> 27:24.400
But i may not make the cut.

27:24.400 --> 27:26.700
Oh.

27:26.700 --> 27:29.900
It means you didn't lose
Your faith.

27:30.000 --> 27:31.300
It means you had a doctor

27:31.400 --> 27:33.400
That just didn't say
The right thing.

27:33.400 --> 27:36.400
Nate:
I have this patient --

27:36.500 --> 27:41.300
Alcoholic, high-risk -- but
I gave him a new liver anyway.

27:41.300 --> 27:43.800
Yeah?

27:43.900 --> 27:47.600
He drank afterward, went off his
Medications, came back to us.

27:47.600 --> 27:49.500
No way was i gonna
Retransplant him.

27:49.500 --> 27:52.700
Until?

27:52.700 --> 27:56.400
His son showed up,
Wanting to donate.

27:59.500 --> 28:02.200
Man been sober
For six months?

28:02.200 --> 28:03.700
Mm-hmm.

28:03.700 --> 28:06.700
Son seem like
He could handle it?

28:06.800 --> 28:08.500
Yeah, he does.

28:08.500 --> 28:09.600
So, what's the problem?

28:13.500 --> 28:15.300
Do the dead...

28:17.300 --> 28:19.100
What?

28:19.200 --> 28:22.100
Do the dead ever
Just go away?

28:23.500 --> 28:25.200
Sometimes.

28:27.300 --> 28:29.900
The recoveries, never.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.800
When i look back
Over my career,

28:32.800 --> 28:35.700
Over the thousands
Of operations,

28:35.700 --> 28:40.100
What i remember most vividly
Are always the recoveries,

28:40.100 --> 28:45.000
That one moment when you turn
Off the respirator.

28:45.100 --> 28:49.500
Yeah, but this man --
This alcoholic --

28:49.500 --> 28:53.800
Did you recover
The first donor's liver?

28:53.800 --> 28:58.000
Mm-hmm.
Steelers fan. 44 years old.

29:00.100 --> 29:02.900
Up on the roof of his house
Working on game day,

29:02.900 --> 29:05.500
Trying to get
Better reception.

29:05.500 --> 29:09.100
He slips, falls,
Hits his head.

29:09.100 --> 29:10.200
That was that.

29:10.200 --> 29:13.300
Right.

29:13.300 --> 29:14.600
His wife --

29:14.700 --> 29:16.400
Good woman, two kids --

29:16.400 --> 29:20.400
Decides on the way to the
Hospital to donate his organs.

29:20.400 --> 29:22.300
Simple as that.

29:22.300 --> 29:24.600
She made her peace.

29:24.600 --> 29:26.400
She signed the forms.

29:26.400 --> 29:28.300
We performed the recovery

29:28.400 --> 29:31.600
And took his perfect liver
To my patient.

29:31.700 --> 29:36.400
Are we talking
About the dead?

29:38.700 --> 29:40.900
How would his widow feel
If she knew that?

29:40.900 --> 29:42.600
How would
His children feel?

29:42.600 --> 29:45.300
They walk this earth thinking
That a part of him

29:45.400 --> 29:48.700
Still walks this earth
Along with them.

29:48.800 --> 29:52.200
Nate, that donor is dead
And gone.

29:52.200 --> 29:54.200
Your patient is not.

29:54.300 --> 29:57.500
You have to focus
On the living.

29:57.500 --> 29:59.300
That's what we do.

29:59.300 --> 30:03.800
More life.
More life.

30:03.900 --> 30:06.900
Whoever's dead and gone,
That's --

30:06.900 --> 30:10.500
We owe them no debt.

30:46.000 --> 30:50.500
Go ahead.
Give him another chance.

30:54.300 --> 30:58.100
Dr. Grant?

30:58.100 --> 30:59.800
Dr. Grant.

31:53.300 --> 31:56.700
Kate: arthur gilliam...

31:59.800 --> 32:02.700
Jim hartog, there you go.

32:15.000 --> 32:18.100
Okay.
Here's how it's gonna go.

32:18.100 --> 32:20.400
I'll take you both down
To the o.r. Together.

32:20.400 --> 32:22.600
The operation's gonna take
About 10 hours.

32:22.600 --> 32:26.000
If at any time we feel
Your son's life is in danger

32:26.000 --> 32:29.700
Or that his liver won't work,
We're going to stop, okay?

32:29.700 --> 32:32.800
Any questions?

32:35.400 --> 32:37.000
I'll see you
In the operating room.

32:37.000 --> 32:41.200
Last time, i thought...

32:41.200 --> 32:44.300
After the operation,
Life might be different.

32:44.400 --> 32:46.600
I thought when i got home,

32:46.700 --> 32:50.000
Something would be waiting
For me -- someone.

32:50.100 --> 32:54.200
But then i got home --
The apartment.

32:54.200 --> 32:57.200
The bar on the corner.
My friends were still in there.

32:57.200 --> 32:59.000
The ball games were on.

33:03.200 --> 33:04.900
I've been a disappointment.

33:06.900 --> 33:09.800
I've broken promises.

33:12.100 --> 33:14.600
I screwed up as a husband...

33:18.200 --> 33:20.300
...as a father.

33:20.300 --> 33:21.800
Dad.

33:23.600 --> 33:27.200
Walk away from all of this.

33:27.200 --> 33:29.300
You need to walk away.

33:39.300 --> 33:43.200
I can give you another chance,
Mr. Gilliam.

33:46.100 --> 33:50.200
The rest is up to you...

33:50.200 --> 33:54.200
But i can give you
Another chance.

34:02.400 --> 34:04.000
How's it going?

34:04.000 --> 34:07.600
She's perfect.
She's absolutely perfect.

34:09.800 --> 34:11.300
You didn't think an organ

34:11.400 --> 34:13.400
Was gonna come available
For hartog, did you?

34:13.400 --> 34:15.800
Nope.
Do i still get to perform
The procedure?

34:15.800 --> 34:17.600
I gave you my word.
Thank you.

34:17.699 --> 34:20.199
But the minute you start to get
In over your head --

34:20.300 --> 34:22.900
Last i checked, anatomically,
Patients from pittsburgh

34:22.900 --> 34:25.100
Were just the same
As patients from canada.

34:29.900 --> 34:31.800
There you go.

34:43.300 --> 34:47.900
* all of the king's horses

34:47.900 --> 34:52.400
* and all of the king's men

34:52.400 --> 34:56.400
* couldn't put my heart

34:56.400 --> 35:00.400
* back together again

35:02.000 --> 35:06.100
* all of the physicians

35:06.100 --> 35:11.300
* and mathematicians, too

35:11.400 --> 35:14.800
* failed to stop my heart

35:14.900 --> 35:18.000
* from breaking in two

35:18.000 --> 35:21.500
* 'cause all i need is you

35:21.500 --> 35:23.900
It's okay.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.200
* i just need you

35:26.200 --> 35:28.100
You're gonna be great.

35:28.100 --> 35:30.200
* yeah, you've got the glue

35:30.200 --> 35:32.500
Okay.
Let's do this.

35:32.500 --> 35:36.300
* so i'm gonna give
My heart to you *

35:38.900 --> 35:43.100
* i had a premonition

35:43.100 --> 35:48.400
* a movie in my mind

35:48.400 --> 35:52.700
* i'll follow my suspicions

35:52.700 --> 35:57.200
* of what i would find

35:57.200 --> 36:01.200
* all i need is you

36:01.200 --> 36:05.700
* i just need you

36:05.800 --> 36:10.100
* yeah, you've got the glue

36:10.100 --> 36:11.900
* i'm gonna give my heart
To you *

36:12.000 --> 36:13.700
I see you can sew.

36:13.800 --> 36:16.900
Yeah, it went well.

36:16.900 --> 36:20.800
* yeah, you've got the glue

36:20.800 --> 36:23.900
* i'm gonna give my heart
To you *

36:23.900 --> 36:25.100
Thank you...

36:25.100 --> 36:29.000
* yeah, you've got the glue

36:30.700 --> 36:32.900
...for letting me do
The procedure.

36:32.900 --> 36:36.100
We'll see
How he manages the rehab

36:36.100 --> 36:37.900
And the antirejection drugs.

36:38.000 --> 36:42.000
* i'm gonna give my heart
To you *

36:45.700 --> 36:55.300
* oooh, oooh

36:55.300 --> 37:01.100
* oooh, ahhh

37:01.100 --> 37:04.500
I was told
You were moving out.

37:08.400 --> 37:11.900
I'm trying.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.600
Huh.

37:14.600 --> 37:17.400
Bart's office.

37:17.400 --> 37:18.500
What?

37:18.500 --> 37:21.200
It's hard to take
Bart's office, huh?

37:23.900 --> 37:25.900
Good work tonight.

37:25.900 --> 37:29.000
Oh. Thanks.

37:30.300 --> 37:33.900
Tom, you know?
My -- my name is tom.

37:34.000 --> 37:36.800
I know.

37:41.200 --> 37:44.500
Well, i got to get going.
Got to move my minivan.

37:44.500 --> 37:46.100
Some surgeon
Has been bitching

37:46.200 --> 37:47.500
About it being parked
In his spot, so...

38:14.400 --> 38:17.300
It's a very pretty dress,

38:17.400 --> 38:21.400
And you are very pretty
In it.

38:24.100 --> 38:26.100
Why did you let me
Stay home yesterday?

38:26.200 --> 38:28.900
Because you said
You were sick.

38:28.900 --> 38:31.300
Yeah, but you knew
I was lying.

38:33.800 --> 38:35.800
Maybe i miss spending time
With you.

38:35.800 --> 38:40.800
Maybe you thought i was old
Enough to go to work with you

38:40.900 --> 38:42.700
And see what you do?

38:42.800 --> 38:45.300
Maybe.
Maybe.

38:45.400 --> 38:47.000
"maybe."

38:48.300 --> 38:52.300
I can handle going to the dance
By myself.

38:52.300 --> 38:55.500
Well, that is,
If you let me go.

38:55.500 --> 38:57.400
Without me?

38:57.400 --> 38:58.400
Without you.

39:04.100 --> 39:05.200
Hey.

39:05.200 --> 39:06.700
Hey.
What's up?

39:06.700 --> 39:09.700
Sorry to just drop in.

39:09.700 --> 39:11.700
You okay?

39:11.700 --> 39:14.100
Yeah, fine. Fine.

39:20.000 --> 39:24.900
You know, i think we should let
Thea go to the dance alone.

39:24.900 --> 39:27.400
I think she'll be fine.

39:28.800 --> 39:31.900
Sure you're all right?

39:39.500 --> 39:43.100
You've given me more than
A few chances, katie.

39:45.400 --> 39:47.400
Nate --

39:47.500 --> 39:49.900
I needed to tell you that.

39:49.900 --> 39:54.200
You've given me more chances
Than i probably deserve.

39:56.700 --> 40:00.100
You know i would love
For you to come inside.

40:00.200 --> 40:03.600
I miss you
Inside this house.

40:08.200 --> 40:09.300
But?

40:11.700 --> 40:14.200
I think
It's time we move on.

40:16.900 --> 40:19.300
We love each other,
And we'll always be a family --

40:19.300 --> 40:22.800
In our way -- but...

40:39.200 --> 40:40.500
You're right...

40:42.800 --> 40:44.200
...about thea.

40:44.300 --> 40:48.600
It's too late for us
To start laying down new laws.

40:51.600 --> 40:53.300
It's too late for that.

41:03.700 --> 41:06.300
Hey.

41:06.400 --> 41:09.600
How was
That gilliam procedure?

41:09.600 --> 41:10.800
Well.

41:10.800 --> 41:13.200
Good. Good.

41:13.300 --> 41:14.600
Good for you.

41:14.700 --> 41:17.200
Give that man
Another shot.

41:17.200 --> 41:19.200
What about you?

41:19.200 --> 41:20.500
Me?

41:21.600 --> 41:24.100
My guess is
If i had new lungs,

41:24.100 --> 41:26.700
I'd be back
To three packs a day.

41:26.700 --> 41:30.000
Could still do that reduction,
Give you a few more months.

41:30.100 --> 41:31.300
No, no.

41:31.400 --> 41:35.600
I'm gonna take janet
To dublin.

41:37.200 --> 41:38.200
Dublin?

41:38.200 --> 41:39.500
Yeah.

41:39.600 --> 41:42.200
My mother was born there,
And i've never been, so...

41:42.300 --> 41:43.800
Dublin?

41:43.800 --> 41:46.600
[ chuckling ]
Dublin. Yeah.

41:50.100 --> 41:53.600
Oh, um, listen.

41:53.600 --> 41:56.700
I hope you'll keep joyce
On as your secretary.

41:56.700 --> 42:00.500
She was very loyal to me
For decades.

42:00.600 --> 42:04.000
I'd...appreciate it.

42:04.000 --> 42:05.900
Take care.

42:18.200 --> 42:20.800
Is this seat taken?

42:24.200 --> 42:25.600
Kate:
"one special day,

42:25.700 --> 42:28.900
"i find some extra bolts
Of white sateen

42:28.900 --> 42:32.300
And make the beautifulest gown
I've ever seen."

42:34.500 --> 42:38.900
"i make a veil
And long white gloves

42:38.900 --> 42:41.200
"and turn around to see
My handsome groom,

42:41.300 --> 42:43.800
Tuxedo clad,
Smiling back at me."

42:45.800 --> 42:48.500
"the whole cathedral stands
And stares

42:48.500 --> 42:50.300
"and marvels at my train.

42:50.300 --> 42:54.100
But when i reach the altar,
I'm alone again."

42:54.100 --> 42:57.400
