- Oh, so hot.
Oh, so sweaty.

00:51.684 --> 00:54.054
Sweat dripping off
of my 10-year-old Johnson.

00:54.454 --> 00:56.389
This is not worth the $40.

00:56.456 --> 00:58.124
- Oh, Tommy, thank you so much.

00:58.224 --> 01:00.126
Look at you!
You're such a doll.

01:00.226 --> 01:02.429
- Oh, no problem.
That's gonna be 40 bucks.

01:02.529 --> 01:04.764
- Oh my gosh!
I love your industrious spirit,

01:04.864 --> 01:07.133
but here is a plate of brownies
for your trouble.

01:07.233 --> 01:09.235
- What do you mean?
Brownies instead of--

01:09.302 --> 01:10.637
- instead of money?

01:10.737 --> 01:12.605
- I'm just a little short
on cash right now.

01:12.705 --> 01:14.641
- I just mowed the lawn
for two hours.

01:14.741 --> 01:16.543
- Sweetheart, you shouldn't be
helping neighbors

01:16.609 --> 01:18.211
for the money, okay?
You should be helping them

01:18.278 --> 01:22.148
for the exchange of goodwill
and good brownies!

01:22.749 --> 01:24.150
Bye-bye, Tommy!

01:24.250 --> 01:25.652
- I'm saying no.
What's happening?

01:25.752 --> 01:27.754
- Bye sweetheart! B-bye!

01:27.821 --> 01:29.656
- "B-bye"?

01:29.756 --> 01:31.424
Oh, what a day.

01:31.491 --> 01:33.726
This is not a quality lawnmower
at all, is it?

01:33.793 --> 01:34.928
- Excuse me, kid.

01:34.994 --> 01:36.262
- Me?

01:36.329 --> 01:37.664
- What the hell do you think
you're doing?

01:37.764 --> 01:39.165
- I was just walking home.

01:39.265 --> 01:41.835
- No, what you're doing
is stealing clients

01:41.935 --> 01:44.337
by undercutting my prices.

01:44.437 --> 01:46.840
- Stealing clients? I'm 10.
- Oh-ho!

01:46.940 --> 01:51.077
You're one of these kids
who likes to hide behind math!

01:51.144 --> 01:52.445
- What's happening?

01:52.512 --> 01:53.813
- You're stealing food
from my family.

01:53.913 --> 01:55.181
- No.
- That job...

01:55.281 --> 01:56.349
- Stop.

01:56.449 --> 01:58.017
- Could've been
a hot meal...

01:58.118 --> 01:59.986
- Stop.
- On my son's plate.

02:00.086 --> 02:01.488
- Hey, Tom.
- Oh, hey, Randy.

02:01.588 --> 02:02.689
- Yeah, Tom.
Why did you steal my dinner?

02:02.789 --> 02:03.957
- No, you've got it all wrong.

02:04.023 --> 02:05.358
I literally got paid
in brownies.

02:05.458 --> 02:06.993
I didn't even get money.
- Oh!

02:07.093 --> 02:09.696
Great, so you stole my dessert.
That's even worse.

02:09.796 --> 02:11.264
- You steal desserts!

02:11.331 --> 02:15.969
A child's reward
for what he does, you steal!

02:19.205 --> 02:20.874
- What just happened?

02:20.974 --> 02:23.543
<i>- Whoo, Tom,
these are incredible!</i>

02:23.643 --> 02:25.178
This is even better than money.

02:25.278 --> 02:27.280
- I don't know about that.
- Tom, if I've taught you

02:27.347 --> 02:29.649
one thing
as a mother, what is it?

02:29.716 --> 02:31.718
- You can't eat money?
- Exactly.

02:31.818 --> 02:32.986
Keep these brownies coming.

02:33.052 --> 02:34.988
Oh, hang on.

02:35.054 --> 02:36.556
Oh, hi, Denise.
What's up, girl?

02:37.123 --> 02:39.659
Why yes, Tom is mowing lawns
for baked goods.

02:39.726 --> 02:41.060
- Oh, no!
Don't encourage that.

02:41.161 --> 02:42.862
- Will he mow your lawn
for a Bundt cake?

02:42.962 --> 02:44.731
- Give me the phone.
- Of course he will!

02:44.831 --> 02:46.032
We'll put you down
for Saturday.

02:46.132 --> 02:47.233
Take care, Denise.

02:47.333 --> 02:48.735
- Oh my God! Denise!
- Too late.

02:48.835 --> 02:50.470
- Mom, I don't think
you have the authority

02:50.537 --> 02:51.905
to accept jobs on my behalf.
That's against the law.

02:52.005 --> 02:53.473
- Tom, I'm your mom.

02:53.540 --> 02:55.575
I have complete and unchecked
authority over you.

02:55.675 --> 02:57.010
- No, let's call the mayor.

02:57.076 --> 02:58.678
Let's call somebody.
What's going on here?

02:58.745 --> 03:00.180
- Let's call--hey!
Call the mayor.

03:00.246 --> 03:02.148
- Oh, my God.
- Hi, Rick.

03:02.215 --> 03:04.017
It's funny you ask, Rick.
Tom is accepting new clients.

03:04.083 --> 03:05.552
- No, no, no.
- Sure.

03:05.652 --> 03:06.853
Snickerdoodles.
That sounds great.

03:06.920 --> 03:08.087
- Snickerdoodles?

03:08.188 --> 03:09.255
- I'll put you down
for Saturday.

03:09.355 --> 03:10.590
- Rick...

03:10.690 --> 03:12.192
- He's gonna love working
for baked goods.

03:12.258 --> 03:15.929
- Woot, woot!
- Kids, follow your dreams.

03:16.029 --> 03:17.263
Good things will happen.

03:17.363 --> 03:18.665
Aim high.

03:19.933 --> 03:21.100
- That was inspiring.

03:21.201 --> 03:23.536
Wow.
Listen to that stuff, kids!

03:23.603 --> 03:25.772
Next up to tell us

03:25.872 --> 03:29.342
He is a landscaper.
He works with mulch and trees.

03:29.409 --> 03:32.679
- Oh, no.
- Give it up for Mr. Miller.

03:36.382 --> 03:38.918
- Kids, remember this face,

03:39.018 --> 03:42.021
because it is
the face of failure.

03:42.088 --> 03:43.756
Look at it!
All of you!

03:43.856 --> 03:45.391
Don't avert your eyes!

03:45.458 --> 03:49.462
I had a successful business,
and then Tom here...

03:49.562 --> 03:50.930
- Oh, no.
Leave me out of this.

03:51.030 --> 03:55.201
- ...swooped in and stole
all my clients.

03:55.268 --> 03:56.569
- I didn't swoop.

03:56.636 --> 04:00.773
- I can't find work,
and my son can't eat.

04:00.873 --> 04:02.875
- I'm hungry, Dad.
- Randy, please...

04:02.942 --> 04:04.244
- I'm starving, Papa!

04:04.310 --> 04:06.446
- That felt preplanned.
- I know you are.

04:06.546 --> 04:08.982
But I can't provide
for my family

04:09.082 --> 04:10.650
because of Tom, Randy.

04:10.750 --> 04:12.485
- All right, listen, everyone.
I feel terrible.

04:12.585 --> 04:14.721
If there's anything I can do,
just say the word.

04:14.787 --> 04:17.156
- Can we crash at your house?
We're being evicted.

04:17.257 --> 04:19.325
- No, that's a bit much.
Good luck, though.

04:19.425 --> 04:20.793
Hope you guys find something.

04:20.893 --> 04:22.228
If you need anything,
just say the word.

04:22.295 --> 04:23.830
- Can we crash at your house?

04:23.930 --> 04:25.431
- If you need anything
other than shelter,

04:25.498 --> 04:27.066
other than housing...

04:27.133 --> 04:29.168
- Tom, you just said,
"If there's anything I can do."

04:29.269 --> 04:30.503
- No, that's
a figure of speech.

04:30.603 --> 04:31.904
I was just making small talk.

04:31.971 --> 04:34.274
- Small talk?
These people need shelter!

04:34.340 --> 04:36.676
- And isn't your dad in, like,
Myrtle Beach or something,

04:36.776 --> 04:39.646
so you actually have
plenty of room?

04:39.746 --> 04:41.581
- Tom, why do you hate
my dad's business?

04:41.648 --> 04:43.916
Why do you hate our family?
Why did you steal my dinner?

04:43.983 --> 04:45.184
- All right, you know what?

04:45.285 --> 04:46.753
My mom is not big
on houseguests,

04:46.819 --> 04:48.488
but I feel like
she's gonna understand.

04:48.588 --> 04:50.356
Our home is your home.

04:53.626 --> 04:54.694
- You want to have
a belching contest?

04:55.962 --> 04:57.630
- That's good!

04:57.697 --> 04:58.931
I win again!

04:58.998 --> 05:00.933
- How long are you two
staying again?

05:01.000 --> 05:03.770
- There was no end date.

05:03.836 --> 05:04.937
Wake up, Tom!

05:05.004 --> 05:06.172
- What's happening?
Why? What?

05:06.272 --> 05:08.007
- We're playing Jenga!
Come on.

05:08.107 --> 05:09.709
- You woke me up for Jenga?

05:09.809 --> 05:12.045
- What?
"Some pulp"?

05:12.145 --> 05:14.347
Okay, I guess I'm "some happy"
right now.

05:14.447 --> 05:15.815

I'm no singer.

06:20.380 --> 06:22.248

You're great.

06:22.348 --> 06:24.283
- You think I could sing
professionally?

06:24.384 --> 06:27.587
- If it gets you out
of my house, I really do.

06:27.687 --> 06:29.021
- Me too.
I think you can do it.

06:29.088 --> 06:31.290
- Tom will even join you
at the audition

06:31.391 --> 06:32.759
to make sure it goes well.

06:32.859 --> 06:33.793
- Oh no, I'm not joining
anyone.

06:33.893 --> 06:35.061
I don't join things.

06:35.128 --> 06:36.629
- Tom, you bankrupted
my father.

06:36.729 --> 06:38.731
The least you can do
is tag along and clap.

06:44.737 --> 06:46.305
- Yo, Tom!
- Oh, Nelson.

06:46.406 --> 06:48.074
Hey, I didn't know
you were gonna be here.

06:48.141 --> 06:49.409
You guys are all auditioning?

06:49.475 --> 06:51.577

06:51.644 --> 06:52.879
Watch this.
Whoa!

06:52.945 --> 06:53.946
Oh! A quarter?

06:54.046 --> 06:55.214
- Oh, my God, that was amazing.

06:55.281 --> 06:56.649
- Man.
That's magic, brother.

06:56.749 --> 06:58.651
- Principal, what kind of act
do you do?

06:58.751 --> 07:00.153
- It sounds boring, but it's--

07:00.253 --> 07:02.722
I do a tap dance routine
with my dog.

07:02.789 --> 07:04.290
- Wow. Lot of good acts.
Lot of strong acts.

07:04.390 --> 07:05.591
- What are you doing, Tom?

07:05.658 --> 07:07.293
I didn't know
you had any talents.

07:07.393 --> 07:09.162
- Oh, I'm not talented, no.
I'm just here to make sure

07:09.262 --> 07:10.963
the landscaper's audition
goes well.

07:11.063 --> 07:12.331
- What?
- He moved into our house

07:12.432 --> 07:13.666
with his son.
Now I'm helping him...

07:13.766 --> 07:14.834
- What?
- Reinvent his career.

07:14.934 --> 07:16.169
It's a long story.

07:16.269 --> 07:17.470
- If I had a penny
for all your stories,

07:17.570 --> 07:19.238
I would have a--
ah-oh--a quarter!

07:19.305 --> 07:20.573
- That's good.
It gets me every time.

07:20.640 --> 07:21.941
- I think I'm ready.

07:32.118 --> 07:34.187
- Thank you for coming in.
- Thank you.

07:34.287 --> 07:36.789
- Next up, I've got
a Mr. Miller.

07:36.856 --> 07:38.357
- Thanks for seeing me.

07:38.458 --> 07:42.528
My passion is to write
and sing original songs,

07:42.628 --> 07:45.932
mostly about landscaping.
Here we go.

07:47.967 --> 07:53.139

07:53.206 --> 07:54.440

Thank you for coming in.

07:56.609 --> 07:58.277
- Oh, you didn't like it?
- Oh, no, no.

07:58.344 --> 07:59.712
You have a lovely voice.

07:59.812 --> 08:01.948
There's just no market
for landscaping ballads.

08:02.014 --> 08:04.183
Just a tough genre,
if you know what I mean.

08:04.283 --> 08:05.451
- At least let the guy
finish the song.

08:05.518 --> 08:06.719
He waited for hours.

08:06.819 --> 08:08.221
- And who are you?

08:08.321 --> 08:09.722
- I'm Tom.
I'm his landlord.

08:09.822 --> 08:11.023
- That's funny.

08:11.123 --> 08:13.025
Now, this kid
has an interesting look.

08:13.125 --> 08:15.061
And look at his brother.
What a pair.

08:15.161 --> 08:16.729
- Oh, no, we're not brothers.

08:16.829 --> 08:18.965
- No, yeah, we have
an open disdain for each other.

08:19.866 --> 08:22.368
- I love the banter.
What a family.

08:22.468 --> 08:23.669
- We're not a family.

08:23.736 --> 08:25.805
- But we do live
under the same roof, Tom.

08:25.872 --> 08:27.373
- Yeah.
We don't like each other.

08:27.473 --> 08:30.243
There's constant discontent.
We're a family.

08:30.343 --> 08:32.645
- What if you do this act,
but as a boy band?

08:32.712 --> 08:33.913
- What? No.

08:34.013 --> 08:36.349
- A boy band that includes
one of the dads?

08:36.415 --> 08:37.717
I mean, it's never been done.

08:37.817 --> 08:39.919
- Love it. Fresh idea.
- Genius.

08:40.019 --> 08:41.888
- That sounds like
the worst act ever.

08:41.988 --> 08:43.756
- Why don't you not tell me
how to do my business, kid?

08:43.856 --> 08:46.726
Come back in next week, because
you guys are in round one.

08:46.826 --> 08:48.261
- What? No, no, no.
- Yes.

08:48.361 --> 08:50.496
- Son, our problems are over.

08:51.931 --> 08:53.266
All right, here we go.
Ready?

08:53.366 --> 08:54.600
Hit it!

08:54.700 --> 08:57.203
♪ I'm here mowing lawns ♪

08:57.270 --> 09:00.740
♪ And applying mulch ♪
- ♪ Mulch ♪

09:00.840 --> 09:03.209
- ♪ And I'm blowing
people's leaves ♪

09:03.276 --> 09:05.244
- ♪ I'm here ♪
- Blowing leaves.

09:05.344 --> 09:08.881
- ♪ But it's no fun
when you're not here ♪

09:08.948 --> 09:11.117
- Oh, my God.
What am I seeing?

09:11.217 --> 09:13.052
- ♪ I think it's time
to leave ♪

09:13.119 --> 09:14.253
- Blow me from here.

09:14.353 --> 09:16.088
- Okay. Stop the music.
Tom!

09:16.188 --> 09:17.957
- What's wrong?
- You need to sell it.

09:18.057 --> 09:19.525
- I was snapping,
snapping and dancing.

09:19.592 --> 09:22.728
- Big smile.
Snap like you mean it.

09:22.795 --> 09:24.597
- Tom, can I have a word
with you, buddy?

09:24.697 --> 09:26.899
- All right, you guys practice.
I'm gonna go talk to Nelson.

09:26.966 --> 09:29.135
- Here we go. Here we go.
All right, you ready?

09:29.235 --> 09:30.636
- Hey, buddy. What's up?

09:30.736 --> 09:31.971
- Hey, what are you doing?
- What am I doing?

09:32.071 --> 09:33.639
I joined
a family-based boy band

09:33.739 --> 09:35.875
that sings about landscaping.
We made it to round one.

09:35.942 --> 09:38.144
Good shot at
the million dollars, I think.

09:38.244 --> 09:40.112
- Big smile!
- Tom, Tom...

09:40.212 --> 09:41.314
- Randy, what are you doing?

09:41.414 --> 09:42.615
- Tom.
- You okay?

09:42.715 --> 09:44.150
Why are you
rubbing your temples?

09:44.250 --> 09:45.484
- You're not winning anything.
- All right.

09:45.585 --> 09:46.719
Sounds like you're jealous,
so I'm--

09:46.786 --> 09:47.820
- Jealous?
Come on, man.

09:47.920 --> 09:49.155
Haven't you seen those shows?

09:49.255 --> 09:50.590
You guys are
the "token bad act."

09:50.656 --> 09:52.124
- Token bad act?
What does that even mean?

09:52.224 --> 09:53.159
- They bring you on the show

09:53.259 --> 09:54.760
so they can make fun of you.

09:54.827 --> 09:56.629
- That's why we're on the show?
- It's a setup.

09:56.729 --> 09:58.097
- Oh, no.
This is not good at all.

09:58.164 --> 10:00.333
- Randy.
- If you can't snap,

10:00.433 --> 10:02.001
you don't belong
in the business.

10:02.101 --> 10:03.336
- I'm telling you, man.
I'm gonna be honest with you.

10:03.436 --> 10:04.503
You need to bail on this.

10:04.604 --> 10:05.605
I can't be friends with a guy

10:05.671 --> 10:07.006
in a landscaping boy band.

10:07.106 --> 10:09.342
- I appreciate the talk,
but I gotta be honest.

10:09.442 --> 10:11.010
My gut is saying go for it.

10:11.110 --> 10:12.812
- Tom, you're wearing
a jumpsuit,

10:12.912 --> 10:14.447
snapping and dancing.
- Yeah?

10:14.513 --> 10:17.283
- You clearly don't make
good decisions in life.

10:22.121 --> 10:24.490
- Tom, you have
outdone yourself.

10:24.590 --> 10:26.692
I can't believe
they sent a limo!

10:26.792 --> 10:28.594
- They do it
for all on-camera talent.

10:28.661 --> 10:30.496
- What now?
- And it's not a limo.

10:30.596 --> 10:32.198
It's a nasty old town car.

10:32.298 --> 10:34.300
- In my opinion,
if it's got a glass wall,

10:34.367 --> 10:36.202
it's a limo, and please zip it.

10:37.169 --> 10:38.971
- Enjoy.
- I'm proud of you, Tom.

10:39.038 --> 10:40.473
- Thank you.

10:40.539 --> 10:42.041
- 'Cause not only are you
getting these lunatics

10:42.141 --> 10:45.211
out of our house,
you could also win $1 million.

10:45.311 --> 10:46.879
- Mom, don't get your hopes up.

10:46.979 --> 10:48.948
I don't think our act
is that strong, to be honest.

10:49.015 --> 10:50.883
- Hello?

10:50.983 --> 10:54.320
Actually, my son
cannot mow your lawn today.

10:54.387 --> 10:55.888
- Oh, no, I can.
- Go ahead, fire him.

10:55.988 --> 10:58.724
Your Bundt cake sucks anyway.
Bye, bitch.

10:58.824 --> 11:01.327
- You can't do that.
- Millionaires don't mow lawns.

11:01.394 --> 11:03.162
Ya heard?

11:03.229 --> 11:05.631
Hello.
No, Tom can't make it.

11:05.698 --> 11:06.699
- I'll be there.

11:06.799 --> 11:07.967
- He said, and I quote,

11:08.034 --> 11:09.402
"Tell Mrs. Ryan

11:09.502 --> 11:12.571
to shove her weedwhacker
straight up her own crack."

11:13.205 --> 11:14.840
I know, kids these days.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.911
- All right, buddy.
I just need to mic you up.

11:19.011 --> 11:21.681
- Oh, okay. Showbiz.
Very exciting.

11:21.747 --> 11:23.382
- Hey, where are
your dad and brother?

11:23.482 --> 11:24.884
- I have no idea.

11:24.984 --> 11:26.252
- What do you mean?
- We're not a tight family.

11:26.352 --> 11:27.420
- Oh, you've got
to be shitting me!

11:27.520 --> 11:28.688
We need them.
- What?

11:28.754 --> 11:30.089
- You're on in 10 minutes.
- Oh.

11:30.189 --> 11:31.590
- We're gonna have
to call them.

11:31.691 --> 11:32.925
- Okay.
- Here.

11:33.025 --> 11:34.193
<i>- Hello?</i>

11:34.260 --> 11:35.361
- Where are you?
We go on in 10 minutes.

11:35.428 --> 11:36.762
- Can't hear you, Tom.

11:36.862 --> 11:37.997
I'm mowing a lawn.

11:38.064 --> 11:39.498
- You're mowing a lawn?

11:39.565 --> 11:41.567
- I've been flooded
with calls today, Tom.

11:41.667 --> 11:43.703
All my clients want me back.

11:43.769 --> 11:44.837
- No.

11:44.904 --> 11:46.238
- They said you're unreliable

11:46.338 --> 11:48.074
and rude, Tom.

11:48.174 --> 11:49.442
And your mom told them off.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.243
- Oh, no...
<i>- Remember, Tom.</i>

11:51.343 --> 11:54.413
<i>Snap with conviction
and big smiles.</i>

11:54.513 --> 11:56.015
- Thanks, Dad.
See you later.

11:56.082 --> 11:57.450
- Okay, where are they?

11:57.550 --> 11:58.951
- I know this isn't
what you want to hear.

11:59.051 --> 12:00.553
We're gonna have to cancel.
- Wait, sorry.

12:00.619 --> 12:02.054
Cancel?
We don't do that.

12:02.121 --> 12:04.523
You're going out there
right now.

12:07.393 --> 12:09.628
- That was wonderful.
Wasn't that wonderful, folks?

12:09.729 --> 12:10.930
That was fun.

12:11.030 --> 12:12.064
Well, our next act should be

12:12.131 --> 12:13.733
a real crowd-pleaser, too.

12:13.799 --> 12:15.067
His name is Tom.

12:15.134 --> 12:16.135
He's a former member

12:16.235 --> 12:17.737
of a family-based boy band,

12:17.803 --> 12:20.139
but now he's striking out
on his own,

12:20.239 --> 12:23.476
dancing and snapping
to landscaping music.

12:31.317 --> 12:34.487
- I forget the lyrics...
Something about mulch?

12:34.587 --> 12:36.555
Oh, my God.
This is...

12:36.622 --> 12:39.325
- Oh, what's that?
Look, a quarter.

12:39.425 --> 12:40.893
- Can I get off the stage?

12:40.960 --> 12:42.928
What happens now?

12:42.995 --> 12:44.563
- Excuse me.
Is that your son up there?

12:44.630 --> 12:45.998
Because he is very bad.

12:46.098 --> 12:48.234
- No, my son died
in a weed-whacking accident.

12:48.300 --> 12:50.069
I don't know who this kid is.
