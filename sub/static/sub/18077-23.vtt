After all, this is my town...

00:14.195 --> 00:16.425
I mean, I know these people,
I know what makes them tick.

00:16.497 --> 00:19.728
A wonderful painter.
His name is H.M....

00:19.800 --> 00:21.529
Murdock, is an original.

00:21.869 --> 00:24.099
Then switch the originals
for the forgeries.

00:24.238 --> 00:26.229

00:26.340 --> 00:28.831

(male narrator)
In 1972,
a crack commando unit...

00:36.384 --> 00:38.181
was sent to prison
by a military court...

00:38.252 --> 00:39.549
for a crime
they didn't commit.

00:39.620 --> 00:40.917
These men promptly escaped...

00:40.988 --> 00:42.615
from a maximum-security
stockade...

00:42.690 --> 00:44.214
to the Los Angeles
underground.

00:44.292 --> 00:45.987
Today, still wanted
by the government...

00:46.060 --> 00:47.994

as soldiers of fortune.

00:48.062 --> 00:50.394
If you have a problem,
if no one else can help...

00:50.464 --> 00:51.761
and if you can find them...

00:51.832 --> 00:54.027
maybe you can hire
the A-Team.

03:03.998 --> 03:05.761
l did what he wants.

03:06.367 --> 03:07.857
l painted two pictures.

03:07.935 --> 03:09.334
That's all he said
l had to do.

03:09.403 --> 03:11.371
So, he counted wrong.

03:12.406 --> 03:14.306
Just pick up the brush.

03:15.209 --> 03:16.870
lf l do a third...

03:17.111 --> 03:19.671
he'll want a fourth
and then a fifth.

03:21.382 --> 03:23.282
You can't keep me

03:41.402 --> 03:43.734
We got to get him
to a hospital.

03:44.972 --> 03:47.736
Tepper, l was just trying
to scare him.

03:48.809 --> 03:51.300
Hey, you saw it, Tepper,
l didn't touch his hands,
you saw it!

03:51.378 --> 03:52.606
Shut up!

03:52.847 --> 03:56.442
We'll be lucky
if Mr. Shawn doesn't put us
in the hospital with him!

03:56.784 --> 03:58.911
You both deserve a bullet
in your empty heads.

03:58.986 --> 04:01.011
l tell you
to put a little pressure
on the kid...

04:01.088 --> 04:02.680
you wind up putting him
in a coma!

04:02.757 --> 04:04.088
You realize
what that's gonna do?

04:04.158 --> 04:06.149
lt's gonna put
this whole operation
in jeopardy.

04:06.227 --> 04:08.695
Check his hands, Mr. Shawn.
You'll see
l never went near them.

04:08.763 --> 04:10.196
So, what do you want,
a raise?

04:10.264 --> 04:12.596
What good do his hands
do me now?

04:13.467 --> 04:15.332
Go on, get rid of him.

There's still no change.

when Speed'll come out of it.

it's gonna be all right.

05:36.917 --> 05:38.111
l just know it.

05:38.185 --> 05:41.586

l could find those guys
who did that to Speed.

05:47.628 --> 05:49.459
We gotta get an album.
What?

05:49.530 --> 05:52.021
How many more places
are we gonna go to?

05:52.099 --> 05:53.964
As many as it takes.
Okay.

05:54.034 --> 05:55.797
Can l help you folks
today?

05:55.870 --> 05:59.203
Yeah. l'd like a copy
of Jim Nabors'
Greatest Love Songs.

06:00.407 --> 06:01.931
You're joking, right?

06:02.009 --> 06:05.877
No, that's what the note that
Mr. Lee tacked to my laundry
said to ask for.

06:05.946 --> 06:08.938
Well, l know that Mr. Lee's
got his opinion...

06:09.617 --> 06:11.949
but in my opinion...

06:12.152 --> 06:14.643
Madonna might be better
for you.

06:15.189 --> 06:16.679
She's hot now.

06:17.391 --> 06:19.382
l want Jim Nabors.
Thanks.

06:21.428 --> 06:23.623
Well, come over here
a minute.

06:26.333 --> 06:28.995
Now,
why don't you let me
play this for you...

06:29.069 --> 06:31.094
and then you can be sure
that's what you want...

06:31.171 --> 06:32.832
before you lay out
any money?

06:32.907 --> 06:33.999
Okay.

This is ''Howling Mad''
Murdock...

07:10.277 --> 07:12.142
that's Templeton Peck
and B.A. Baracus.
Hi.

07:12.212 --> 07:14.737
''Howling Mad''?
You got a temper problem
or something?

07:14.815 --> 07:18.342
Oh, no. Actually
this is the guy here
with the personality disorder.

07:18.419 --> 07:20.284
l just consider myself
on another plane...

07:20.354 --> 07:21.844
from the mass populace,
that's all.

07:21.922 --> 07:23.514
His plane crashed years ago.

07:23.590 --> 07:25.455
Left him with no brains
in his head.

07:25.526 --> 07:28.927
Peggy, Mr. Lee said
that a friend of yours
was put in the hospital.

07:28.996 --> 07:30.429
And you don't think
the police...

07:30.497 --> 07:32.397
are really interested
in who put him there.

07:32.466 --> 07:34.730
That's right,
Speed has this reputation.

07:34.802 --> 07:36.963
''Speed''?
As in drugs, amphetamines?

07:37.037 --> 07:38.868
No, Speed is clean.
We gave him the name...

07:38.939 --> 07:40.634
because he's so quick
with the brush.

07:40.708 --> 07:42.107
Speed is a free spirit.

07:42.176 --> 07:45.111
ln fact, he was probably born
about 20 years too late.

07:45.179 --> 07:47.841
He has this
real ''peace and love'' attitude,
you know?

07:47.915 --> 07:50.577
And lot of people laugh
at that kind of stuff
nowadays...

07:50.651 --> 07:53.552
but, anyway,
as far as the police
are concerned...

07:53.620 --> 07:55.053
Speed was just considered
a flake.

07:55.122 --> 07:56.953
And there's no way
they were gonna believe...

07:57.024 --> 07:59.219
that some Beverly Hills
rich guy
put him in the hospital.

07:59.293 --> 08:00.487
''Beverly Hills rich guy''?

08:00.561 --> 08:02.654
Don't mind B.A. Last time
he was in Beverly Hills...

08:02.730 --> 08:04.994
he got in trouble
for throwing a waiter
in a dessert tray.

08:05.065 --> 08:07.795
That dude charged me $1 2
for a bowl of potato soup!

08:07.868 --> 08:09.495
Anyway,
we don't have any proof.

08:09.570 --> 08:10.730
But about a month ago...

08:10.804 --> 08:12.999
some guy who runs
a Beverly Hills gallery...

08:13.073 --> 08:15.871
saw some of Speed's stuff
and signed him on the spot.

08:15.943 --> 08:17.342
Speed must be very good.

08:17.411 --> 08:19.242
His work is wonderful.

08:19.313 --> 08:21.281
He trained under
Solange Martine in Paris.

08:21.348 --> 08:22.645
That's where we met, in fact.

08:22.716 --> 08:24.843
So, anyway,
a couple of weeks ago...

08:24.918 --> 08:26.283
we saw these guys in suits...

08:26.353 --> 08:27.615
pushing Speed around.

08:27.688 --> 08:29.747
And Speed wouldn't tell me
what it was all about.

08:29.823 --> 08:31.484
But the guy
was from the gallery.

08:31.558 --> 08:33.025
l did get that much
out of him.

08:33.092 --> 08:34.616
Boy, l find that
hard to believe.

08:34.695 --> 08:37.789
l mean,
most of the gallery owners
l know are fairly respectable.

08:37.865 --> 08:40.332
Which gallery
did Speed sign with?

08:40.400 --> 08:43.029
Well, that's the problem.
l don't know.

08:43.136 --> 08:44.331
We pooled
our money together.

08:44.405 --> 08:46.305
We can pay you
$1 1,000.

08:46.440 --> 08:48.340
Where'd you kids
get money like that from?

08:48.409 --> 08:51.242
l have a small trust
my grandfather left me
for college.

08:51.779 --> 08:52.973
l never went...

08:53.047 --> 08:55.572
so it's just been
sitting in the bank
earning interest.

08:55.649 --> 08:57.640
But l think
this is important enough
to use it for.

08:57.718 --> 09:01.848
Peggy, would you recognize
Speed's work if you saw it
hanging somewhere?

09:01.922 --> 09:03.685
Yeah, l'm sure l could.

09:03.757 --> 09:06.692
Congratulations,
you've just hired
The A-Team.

09:06.860 --> 09:10.057
At last, a case
that doesn't require
mosquito netting.

09:10.130 --> 09:11.688
Oh, l don't know, Face.

09:11.765 --> 09:14.700
lt's still a jungle out there
on Rodeo Drive.

09:55.242 --> 09:57.335
Man! These people
in Beverly Hills...

09:57.411 --> 09:59.276
look at us like
we're from another planet.

09:59.346 --> 10:01.712
Are you suggesting
that your derivation
is from anything...

10:01.782 --> 10:03.147
but another planet,
big guy?

10:03.217 --> 10:04.241
(B.A.)
Oh, shut up, fool!

10:04.318 --> 10:05.910
l don't like nothing
about this town.

10:05.986 --> 10:07.317
Oh, l don't know, B.A.

10:07.387 --> 10:10.447
This city has certain charms
that l appreciate.

10:12.626 --> 10:13.684

10:16.430 --> 10:17.522
That's it!

10:17.598 --> 10:19.725

paintings!

10:19.800 --> 10:22.234
There are his initials,
''S. Miller.''
This could be the place.

10:22.302 --> 10:23.792

gonna do now?

10:32.913 --> 10:34.710
Beautiful piece of work,
don't you think?

10:34.781 --> 10:36.510
lt's very rare.
Shh!

10:36.683 --> 10:38.344
Just listen to it.

10:38.585 --> 10:41.315
You can almost hear
the boldness
of the sculptor's strokes...

10:41.388 --> 10:44.016
the power of the statement
that it makes!

10:44.992 --> 10:47.085
Yes.
l believe you're right.

10:47.895 --> 10:49.055
Are you an artist
as well?

10:49.129 --> 10:52.496
Michael DeLaine,
Fine Art Magazine.

10:53.267 --> 10:55.167
You've heard of us,
of course.

10:55.235 --> 10:56.725
Oh, sure, yeah.

10:56.803 --> 11:00.569
Yes, l'm writing an article...

11:00.641 --> 11:03.474
on the most prestigious
art galleries in the country.

11:03.544 --> 11:06.945
And l'm basically
evaluating your exclusivity...

11:07.781 --> 11:11.945
style, taste, et cetera,
et cetera...

11:12.252 --> 11:13.719
and et cetera.

11:13.921 --> 11:17.220
Well, l'm sure
you'll find our gallery
very exciting.

11:17.291 --> 11:19.851
We'll see. l must say...

11:19.927 --> 11:24.523
l am very, very impressed
with this young artist...

11:24.798 --> 11:27.460
S. Miller.

11:27.601 --> 11:30.001
l don't believe
l've ever seen
his work before.

11:30.070 --> 11:32.561
Oh, that's because
he's exclusive
with the gallery.

11:33.340 --> 11:35.035
He's one of the young
street artists...

11:35.108 --> 11:36.769
that Mr. Shawn
recently discovered.

11:36.843 --> 11:39.812
Yes, one can almost
sense the grittiness
of the pavement...

11:39.880 --> 11:41.142
in his work,
don't you agree?

11:41.215 --> 11:42.204
(Diane)
Absolutely.

11:42.282 --> 11:45.445
Yes, very exceptional.
l'd even.... No.

11:45.686 --> 11:48.553
Yes, l'd even
go out on a limb and
compare him favorably...

11:48.622 --> 11:50.886
with another local artist,
H.M. Murdock.

11:50.958 --> 11:52.448
H.M. Murdock?

11:52.526 --> 11:54.653
Would you mind showing me
something else of his?

11:54.728 --> 11:56.923
But, l'm afraid
this is all we have
at the moment.

11:56.997 --> 11:59.693
We should be receiving
something from him shortly,
though.

11:59.766 --> 12:00.755
Diane?

12:00.834 --> 12:02.665
Could l speak to you
for a minute, please?

12:02.736 --> 12:04.226
Of course, Mr. Shawn.

12:04.304 --> 12:05.965
Excuse me.
Oh, l'm terribly sorry.

12:06.039 --> 12:07.836
l've taken up too much
of your time.

12:07.908 --> 12:09.068
No, that's okay.

12:09.142 --> 12:12.600
Well, then,
perhaps l could
persuade you...

12:12.679 --> 12:14.408
to have dinner with me
tonight?

12:14.481 --> 12:15.607
Well, l don't--

12:15.682 --> 12:17.946
lt would give us a chance
to continue this...

12:18.018 --> 12:21.579
interesting discussion
of today's rising
young artists, and....

12:21.655 --> 12:22.815
Diane?

12:25.659 --> 12:27.820
Dinner? Sounds lovely.

12:34.134 --> 12:35.123
Yes, Mr. Shawn?

12:35.202 --> 12:36.726
Who's that young man
you were talking to?

12:36.803 --> 12:39.636
That was Michael DeLaine.
He's an art critic
for Fine Art Magazine.

12:39.706 --> 12:42.470
They're doing a story
on all the top galleries
across the country.

12:42.542 --> 12:45.238
lsn't that great?
Look, here's his card.

12:46.647 --> 12:49.172
''Michael DeLaine,
Fine Art Magazine.''

12:51.918 --> 12:54.079
See if those two young ladies
need some help, will you?

12:54.154 --> 12:55.416
Yes, sir.

13:00.894 --> 13:02.521
[[[music playing]

13:02.896 --> 13:03.920
Ah!

13:03.997 --> 13:05.521
[clears throat]

13:06.366 --> 13:07.697
Thank you.

13:10.170 --> 13:11.262
Michael.
What?

13:11.338 --> 13:13.169
l'm having a wonderful time.

13:13.240 --> 13:15.265
l'm so glad, Diane,
l'm....

13:15.342 --> 13:16.707
Ah, thanks.

13:17.244 --> 13:19.872
l'm so very, very glad,
l....

13:21.548 --> 13:23.982
The first time l saw you,
l knew....

13:33.827 --> 13:34.885
Oh, my gosh...

13:34.961 --> 13:36.519
l don't know
what came over me.

13:36.596 --> 13:38.689
l'm so embarrassed!

13:38.765 --> 13:39.857
[chuckles]
Don't be.

13:39.933 --> 13:42.231
No. No, will you excuse me?

13:42.636 --> 13:45.867
l just have to go
to the restroom!

13:48.208 --> 13:49.539
[toilet flushing]

13:49.609 --> 13:52.203
Oh! Twenty-five cents!
Twenty-five cents!

13:52.279 --> 13:54.839
Good, l'll use it
as a down payment
on the new house, big shot.

13:54.915 --> 13:56.883
Murdock, let's move.
l only have a minute.

13:56.950 --> 13:58.713
[Murdock exclaiming]

13:59.453 --> 14:01.148
Rush, rush, rush.

14:01.221 --> 14:04.019
l've been standing in here
handing out towels
for over two hours...

14:04.091 --> 14:07.925
and nobody's had the decency
or courtesy to even engage me
in a meaningful conversation.

14:07.994 --> 14:09.188
Really?

14:10.897 --> 14:12.421

Nails, Sir?
Thank you.

14:17.437 --> 14:19.735
(Murdock)
Your hands are lovely.
Just keep them manicured.

14:19.806 --> 14:21.671
Thanks for the advice.

14:23.977 --> 14:25.035
Hey?

14:25.746 --> 14:28.442
Oh, right.
Listen, you got change
for $5?

14:28.548 --> 14:30.175
Yes, l have.

14:32.486 --> 14:35.478
Thanks, Murdock.
l forgot to tip
the parking attendant.

14:35.555 --> 14:37.079
Yeah, but....

14:38.492 --> 14:39.686
[sighs]

14:42.729 --> 14:43.753
[snaps finger]

14:49.636 --> 14:52.799
Wonderful.
You can meet Michael
now before you go.

14:53.707 --> 14:54.969
l'll be happy to.

14:55.041 --> 14:56.167
(Diane)
Michael DeLaine...

14:56.243 --> 14:58.438
this is my boss
at the gallery,
Steffen Shawn.

14:58.512 --> 15:00.480
A pleasure to meet you,
Mr. Shawn.

15:00.547 --> 15:03.573
You know, when Diane told me
you were a critic
for Fine Art Magazine...

15:03.650 --> 15:04.981
l was a little surprised.

15:05.051 --> 15:06.382
Surprised?

15:06.553 --> 15:08.316
That l hadn't heard of you.

15:08.388 --> 15:10.015
So l placed a call
to your office.

15:10.090 --> 15:13.059
Are you always this cautious
about Diane's dinner dates?

15:13.126 --> 15:15.424
lt's a crazy world,
Mr. DeLaine.

15:15.762 --> 15:17.286
You never know
what the next man...

15:17.364 --> 15:19.764
coming through that door
is gonna do.

15:19.833 --> 15:21.824
Happily, however,
they gave you
a glowing report.

15:21.902 --> 15:23.961
They tell me you're quite
an excellent writer.

15:24.037 --> 15:25.061
Well, l just....

15:25.138 --> 15:26.605
lt's a pleasure to meet you.

15:26.673 --> 15:29.073
Please accept
this invitation...

15:29.142 --> 15:31.201
to visit the gallery
at any time.

15:31.278 --> 15:32.870
Well, thank you.

15:54.134 --> 15:56.432
Okay, Hannibal,
the alarm's disengaged.

15:56.503 --> 15:58.869
(Hannibal)
Good. Now, let's see
if we can find the closet...

15:58.939 --> 16:01.237
where Shawn
hides his skeletons.

16:15.288 --> 16:16.482
Guys...

16:16.923 --> 16:20.290
Shawn had Speed signed
to an exclusive contract...

16:20.360 --> 16:22.191
at $50 a painting.

16:22.529 --> 16:23.723
$50?

16:23.797 --> 16:26.357
The one in the window
was selling for $5,000.

16:26.433 --> 16:29.027
Something big
must have gone down
to have him cancel this.

16:29.102 --> 16:31.127
Hannibal,
the transmitter's in place.

16:31.204 --> 16:32.535
Let's go, l've seen enough.

16:57.564 --> 16:59.225
Looks like
we got a little company.

16:59.332 --> 17:01.266
You heard the Colonel?
He said we're leaving.

17:01.334 --> 17:03.894
Yeah. B.A.,
can l get your opinion
about something?

17:03.970 --> 17:06.268
Aren't you
as surprised as l am...

17:06.339 --> 17:09.172
at the choices
of these so-called artists
with their paintings?

17:09.242 --> 17:11.175
l mean, with the full
color spectrum...

17:11.243 --> 17:12.905
right at their fingertips...

17:12.979 --> 17:14.674
l think their works
are bogged down...

17:14.748 --> 17:16.875
with an overabundance
of primary shades.

17:16.950 --> 17:19.544
l mean, there's no
subtlety to the hue.
Don't you agree?

17:23.323 --> 17:24.813
Yes, l agree.

17:24.891 --> 17:28.122
l'm gonna turn your nose
primary red
if you don't knock it off!

17:30.530 --> 17:33.499
Security patrol.
Let's take care of them
fast and get out of here.

[groaning]

17:44.678 --> 17:45.667
[screams]

18:08.435 --> 18:10.699
The first time
l saw Blomquist's work...

18:10.770 --> 18:12.032
l was so overcome...

18:12.105 --> 18:14.300
so affected
by its intensity...

18:14.374 --> 18:17.002
that l had to excuse myself
from the exhibit...

18:17.077 --> 18:19.102
before l passed out
from sheer exhaustion.

18:20.013 --> 18:21.810
The point being, you see....

18:21.881 --> 18:23.143
[sighing]

18:23.383 --> 18:25.010
[[[music playing]

18:26.987 --> 18:28.852
What is it, Mr. Shawn?

18:29.089 --> 18:30.522
My gallery's been broken into.

18:30.590 --> 18:31.648
(Diane)
Broken into?

18:31.725 --> 18:32.919
How utterly revolting!

18:32.993 --> 18:35.723
The thieves apparently
used a key to get past
the alarm and inside.

18:35.795 --> 18:36.784
No!

18:36.863 --> 18:39.263
But you and l
are the only ones
that have keys.

18:41.801 --> 18:43.564
Here's my set.
Where are yours?

18:43.637 --> 18:44.569
Right in my purse.

18:44.638 --> 18:46.572
Here let me help you
with that. Here you go.

18:46.640 --> 18:48.232
l'm sorry. Here.

18:50.410 --> 18:51.809
Here you go.

18:51.945 --> 18:53.139
Thanks.

19:00.620 --> 19:02.110
Here's my set.

19:07.193 --> 19:08.683
[phone ringing]

19:11.197 --> 19:12.926
Brooks? Shawn here.

19:13.667 --> 19:16.329
l assume you've heard
your men spoiled a break-in
at my gallery.

19:16.403 --> 19:17.370
(Brooks)
Yeah, I heard.

19:17.437 --> 19:19.462
(Shawn)
Yeah, lucky they were
making a pickup tonight.

19:19.539 --> 19:22.565
Sounds like
our security friends
were making a scheduled stop.

19:22.642 --> 19:24.109
That's why
they showed up...

19:24.177 --> 19:26.111
even if the alarm
didn't go off.

19:26.179 --> 19:28.238
(Brooks)
How about lunch tomorrow?

19:28.314 --> 19:29.838
No, l can't make
lunch tomorrow.

19:29.916 --> 19:31.679
l'll be at the art show
in Santa Monica.

19:31.751 --> 19:33.810
We've got to find
a replacement
for Speed Miller...

19:33.887 --> 19:35.582
as soon as possible.

19:35.655 --> 19:39.091
(Shawn)
Look, Brooks, don't try
handling my end for me.

19:39.826 --> 19:41.350
l need to find us
another expert...

19:41.428 --> 19:44.727
not some
paint-by-numbers amateur
off the sidewalk.

19:45.432 --> 19:47.491
Okay,
but we still have to talk.

19:47.567 --> 19:49.194
All right then,
another time.

19:49.269 --> 19:51.430
Whoever Brooks is,
he's got Shawn
under the gun...

19:51.504 --> 19:53.472
to find another artist
to replace Miller.

19:53.540 --> 19:55.405
Yeah. Sounds like Shawn
was using Miller...

19:55.475 --> 19:57.966
for something other than
just ripping off paintings.

19:58.044 --> 19:59.306
lt certainly does,
doesn't it?

19:59.379 --> 20:01.609
Yeah. Well, l assume
you have a plan.

20:01.681 --> 20:03.080
Well, l think
the least we can do...

20:03.149 --> 20:06.050
is supply Shawn and Brooks
with another painter.

20:06.119 --> 20:08.212
What do you think, Colonel?

20:08.855 --> 20:11.585
(Murdock)
l call it
The Meaning of Life.

20:13.026 --> 20:14.493
lt's perfect.

Fine Art Magazine,
Tina speaking.

20:20.734 --> 20:22.463
Hello, darling,
it's Templeton.

20:22.702 --> 20:24.966
Hi, sweetheart.
You know, you were right.

20:25.038 --> 20:27.233
Some guy did call
about you yesterday.

20:27.307 --> 20:30.003
l lied. l told him
how wonderful you were.

20:30.110 --> 20:32.840
l know, honey,
and l just wanna thank you.
You were terrific!

20:32.912 --> 20:34.174
Listen...

20:34.581 --> 20:37.345
we'll do St. Martins again
real soon, okay?

20:37.417 --> 20:38.975
And you take care.

20:39.052 --> 20:41.077
l'll be thinking of you.

20:41.154 --> 20:42.644
Okay. Bye-bye.

20:44.557 --> 20:45.649
[sighing]

20:45.725 --> 20:48.660
B.A.? l want you
to take a look at something.

20:49.229 --> 20:52.460
And l want you to tell me
if your nose hairs don't
tingle with excitement...

20:52.532 --> 20:53.692
at my latest inspiration.

20:53.767 --> 20:55.860
But it ain't nothing
but a bunch
of scribbled lines.

20:55.935 --> 20:58.096
Throw stones if you must,
B.A...

20:58.171 --> 21:00.696
but l want you to know
that most great artists...

21:00.774 --> 21:04.073
during their lifetime,
were ridiculed and scoffed at.

21:04.144 --> 21:05.771
lt was not until
they became a part...

21:05.845 --> 21:08.143
of the great, dark earth,
until they were dead...

21:08.214 --> 21:09.841
that their true genius
was discovered.

21:09.916 --> 21:11.281
And perhaps
that fate awaits me.

21:11.351 --> 21:14.514
Be careful, Murdock.
You may get B.A. to test out
your theory...

21:14.587 --> 21:16.077
a little earlier
than you planned.

21:16.156 --> 21:19.284
You know, Murdock,
l do see something
in your painting.

21:19.359 --> 21:22.294
There l am,
standing over your dead body.

21:23.129 --> 21:24.824
lt's just a bunch
of scribbled lines.

21:24.898 --> 21:26.798
Okay, Hannibal,
what next?

21:26.866 --> 21:28.197
That's a good question,
Peggy.

21:28.268 --> 21:30.668
What is the plan du jour,
Colonel?

21:30.737 --> 21:33.171
First, Face, you got to go
to the art show...

21:33.239 --> 21:34.467
and convince Shawn.

21:34.541 --> 21:36.907
Get him to the point
he's chomping at the bit...

21:36.976 --> 21:39.171
to meet a particular painter.

21:39.412 --> 21:42.381
The great artist of the brush,
palette and canvas...

21:42.448 --> 21:44.177
H.M. Murdock.

21:46.085 --> 21:47.677
[birds chirping]

21:47.921 --> 21:49.650
[people chattering]

21:50.256 --> 21:51.655
Mr. DeLaine?

21:51.925 --> 21:52.914
Thank you.

21:52.992 --> 21:54.152
Shawn.

21:54.460 --> 21:55.791
Pleasant surprise.

21:55.862 --> 21:58.262
Yes, isn't it?
You taking the afternoon off?

21:58.331 --> 22:00.925
l always try
to take in these art fairs
whenever l'm able.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.059
There's always the chance
of stumbling across some...

22:03.136 --> 22:05.127
gifted young artist
yet to be discovered.

22:05.205 --> 22:07.332
Oh, l agree
wholeheartedly.

22:08.174 --> 22:12.110
Although l must admit
that most of these artists...

22:12.178 --> 22:14.112
should have
left their work at home.

22:14.180 --> 22:17.308
l've found you have to
sift through a ton of dirt
to find an ounce of gold.

22:17.383 --> 22:18.543
So true.

22:18.618 --> 22:22.247
That's why it galls me
so to see other painters
with so much talent...

22:22.322 --> 22:24.017
who can't ever seem
to get sponsored...

22:24.090 --> 22:26.684
or even get their artwork
placed in a show like this.

22:26.759 --> 22:29.751
lf you have
someone specific in mind,
out with it.

22:29.829 --> 22:33.629
Actually there is someone
who l'm rather high on lately.

22:33.700 --> 22:35.895
A wonderful painter!

22:36.236 --> 22:38.067
He's part of the vibrant
street scene.

22:38.137 --> 22:40.537
His name is H.M. Murdock.

22:41.407 --> 22:43.432
Murdock? Yes, l believe
l've heard of his work.

22:43.509 --> 22:44.498
Really?

22:44.577 --> 22:46.738
Well, he's a perfect example
of a great artist...

22:46.813 --> 22:49.907
being kept from the public
because of a lack of....

22:49.983 --> 22:51.416
How shall l say?

22:51.484 --> 22:53.145
Appropriate connections.

22:53.219 --> 22:54.208
Mr. DeLaine...

22:54.287 --> 22:56.983
if this Murdock
is half the talent
you profess...

22:57.056 --> 22:58.751
l'd like to meet him
immediately.

22:58.825 --> 23:02.022
Well, l think
it's possible l might be
able to arrange something.

23:02.095 --> 23:03.187
Splendid.

23:03.730 --> 23:05.459
My light is fading!

23:05.899 --> 23:07.696
l'm losing the light.

23:09.068 --> 23:10.729
l need more light.

23:10.970 --> 23:12.665
Oh, right.
Mr. Murdock, now...

23:12.739 --> 23:13.763
[clears throat]

23:13.840 --> 23:15.831
as l was saying,
Mr. Shawn here...

23:15.909 --> 23:18.537
owns a very exclusive
art gallery...

23:18.611 --> 23:20.636
and it would be
quite a boost
to your career...

23:20.713 --> 23:22.840
to have your work
shown there.

23:22.916 --> 23:25.248
After seeing your work,
Mr. Murdock,
l'm convinced...

23:25.318 --> 23:28.219
you have what it takes
to be a great artist.

23:29.489 --> 23:31.582
Can you guarantee me...

23:31.658 --> 23:34.718
that in 100 years,
after l'm gone...

23:35.395 --> 23:37.226
the name Murdock...

23:37.297 --> 23:40.460
will be on a par
with Rembrandt, Picasso...

23:40.533 --> 23:42.660
Van Gogh, Willie Mays....

23:42.902 --> 23:44.301
Willie Mays?

23:44.537 --> 23:47.734
Do you deny that Willie Mays
was a great artist
in center field?

23:48.141 --> 23:50.006
With my representation,
Mr. Murdock...

23:50.076 --> 23:52.340
at least l can guarantee
that you'll have a chance.

23:52.412 --> 23:54.277
The rest is up to you.

23:54.614 --> 23:55.876
Then l agree!

23:55.949 --> 23:57.280
Wonderful.

23:59.819 --> 24:02.913
Let us break pizza
to cement the bargain.

24:03.690 --> 24:05.123
Welcome aboard.

24:05.191 --> 24:08.160
Murdock does not shake hands.
Murdock does not play sports.

24:08.227 --> 24:10.855
Murdock does not
open canned food.

24:13.700 --> 24:15.224
Murdock paints.

24:21.207 --> 24:23.903
Mr. Murdock, welcome
to your new studio.

24:28.581 --> 24:30.105
l don't get it.

24:31.084 --> 24:33.109
l've already got a studio.

24:36.556 --> 24:39.252
My studio and l
go back a long way.

24:39.325 --> 24:42.590
Long before home personal
video cassette recorders.

24:42.929 --> 24:45.159
While you're under contract
with the gallery...

24:45.231 --> 24:46.755
this is your studio.

24:46.833 --> 24:49.233
You don't seem to understand!

24:49.602 --> 24:51.968
l need my studio!

24:52.038 --> 24:55.530
l trained inspiration
to meet me at that studio.

24:55.608 --> 24:57.269
Now, how is it
going to find me?

24:57.343 --> 24:59.174
lf you're unhappy
with the arrangement...

24:59.245 --> 25:02.146
maybe you'd like to return
the $3,000 advance?

25:02.215 --> 25:03.239
No.

25:04.584 --> 25:07.178
No, l can't,
l've already used it...

25:07.253 --> 25:09.915
to pay off my
over seven years' due bills.

25:09.989 --> 25:13.447
Then l suggest
you abide by the terms
of the contract...

25:14.560 --> 25:16.027
and sit down.

25:17.230 --> 25:18.492
[sighing]

25:20.033 --> 25:22.024
Now, here's
your first assignment.

25:22.101 --> 25:24.569
l want a reproduction
of this photograph...

25:24.637 --> 25:27.902
a perfect one,
l hasten to add,
as soon as possible.

25:28.074 --> 25:29.769
Say, 24 hours.

25:30.209 --> 25:32.177
No. No reproductions.

25:32.278 --> 25:34.007
Murdock is an original.

25:34.080 --> 25:36.981
All in good time, Mr. Murdock.
l assure you.

25:37.683 --> 25:39.810
All young artists
must start on assignment...

25:39.886 --> 25:42.616
before being commissioned
to do their own originals.

25:42.688 --> 25:45.589
l have great confidence
in you, Mr. Murdock.

25:46.092 --> 25:47.855
Don't disappoint me.

26:28.201 --> 26:29.793
Mayday, mayday!
This is Murdock.

26:29.869 --> 26:30.858
Colonel, are you there?

26:30.937 --> 26:31.995
Go ahead, Murdock.

26:32.071 --> 26:35.165
Listen, Colonel,
Shawn wants me to paint
a perfect reproduction...

26:35.241 --> 26:37.368
of some picture in 24 hours.

26:37.543 --> 26:40.239
But, I'm plumb
out of sea-lily red.

26:40.313 --> 26:42.941
Well, what does it look like?
Can you describe it?

26:45.518 --> 26:47.918
All right,
there are two ladies...

26:47.987 --> 26:51.388
and two children
with rosy cheeks
in a field with red flowers.

26:51.457 --> 26:55.291
And in the background,
there are some trees
and a house and....

26:55.361 --> 26:57.295
You know, if I was this
painter, though...

26:57.363 --> 26:58.887
I'd have painted these flowers
a deeper color.

26:58.965 --> 27:00.626
A crimson,
definitely a crimson.

27:00.700 --> 27:02.861
lt sounds like
Monet's Wild Poppies.

27:02.935 --> 27:06.098
Yeah, l think she's right,
Hannibal. Take a look.

27:06.906 --> 27:11.366
So, Shawn is a specialist
in dealing in art forgeries.

27:12.011 --> 27:13.171
Well, an original Monet...

27:13.246 --> 27:16.238
brought in over a quarter
of a million dollars
in France last summer.

27:16.315 --> 27:19.478
How is Murdock gonna copy
this Monet guy's picture?

27:19.552 --> 27:21.315
He can't even paint!

27:22.255 --> 27:23.483
Peggy...

27:23.723 --> 27:25.122
do you think
you could copy this...

27:25.191 --> 27:28.786
if you had, say,
24 hours straight
to paint in?

27:28.861 --> 27:31.193
Yeah, sure.
But how're you
gonna get it to him?

27:31.264 --> 27:32.959
l've got an idea.

27:34.534 --> 27:37.002
Okay, Uncle Murdock,
help is on the way.

27:46.946 --> 27:48.607
You careless fool!

27:48.714 --> 27:50.705
This statue is worth
over $10,000.

27:50.783 --> 27:52.410
lt goes back
to the Ming Dynasty!

27:52.485 --> 27:54.350
l don't know nothing
about no Chinese food.

27:54.420 --> 27:56.183
All l know is somebody
ordered a pizza...

27:56.255 --> 27:57.552
and somebody
better pay for it.

27:57.623 --> 28:00.114
Tepper, take care
of this gentleman.

28:00.459 --> 28:02.450
Look at the size
of this thing.

28:02.528 --> 28:03.859
You talking to me?

28:03.930 --> 28:04.954
No.

28:05.932 --> 28:07.923
Here's $1
for yourself.

28:09.735 --> 28:11.600
Yeah. Have a nice day.

28:12.972 --> 28:14.997
(Murdock)
lridescent orange.
Another....

28:15.074 --> 28:17.770
Oh, the light!
l'm losing the light!

28:17.843 --> 28:20.334
Murdock? Your pizza's here.

28:27.853 --> 28:30.651
You haven't delayed...

28:30.890 --> 28:32.949
bringing it down to me,
have you?

28:33.025 --> 28:36.961
l need my pizza heated
to 200 degrees Fahrenheit.

28:37.029 --> 28:39.122
ls it 200 degrees?
lt's hot!

28:39.565 --> 28:40.896
lt's hot. lt's hot.
Take it!

28:40.967 --> 28:42.867
lt's hot! lt's hot!
lt's hot!

28:43.202 --> 28:44.999
You'd be a lousy waiter,
you know that?

28:45.071 --> 28:46.538
lt's hot!
Hot! Hot!

28:47.306 --> 28:49.399
Man, that guy was ignorant!

28:50.142 --> 28:52.167
l bet l know what this is.

28:52.745 --> 28:55.839
l bet l know what this is.

28:56.115 --> 28:57.514
[exclaiming]

28:57.850 --> 28:59.215
[[[humming]

29:09.829 --> 29:11.194
Well, well, well.

29:15.401 --> 29:17.835
Boy, l didn't know
l paint so good.

29:18.771 --> 29:22.332
Very nice work, Mr. Murdock,
very nice.

29:22.775 --> 29:24.504
All right, you two,
the van's outside.

29:24.577 --> 29:26.875
Be ready to leave
in 10 minutes.

29:39.492 --> 29:41.016
Omega Security.

29:41.560 --> 29:44.688
Those are the guys
who gave us a hard time
the other night, aren't they?

29:44.764 --> 29:45.924
Right.

29:47.733 --> 29:49.223
Well, they got the painting.

29:49.302 --> 29:50.963
Let's follow them.

30:16.362 --> 30:18.728
(Hannibal)
Looks like
they were expected.

30:39.618 --> 30:42.451
We'll stay put
till they make another move.

30:49.628 --> 30:51.789
(B.A.)
There they go, Hannibal.
We're gonna follow them?

30:51.864 --> 30:53.422
We go
where that painting goes.

30:53.499 --> 30:55.592
That painting ain't moving.

31:00.005 --> 31:02.371
(Face)
Your wires must be crossed.
They're taking off.

31:02.441 --> 31:04.807
l'm telling you, Face,
that painting
ain't going nowhere.

31:04.877 --> 31:06.310
lt must be
still in the house.

31:06.379 --> 31:08.279
Well, lf our copy's
in the house...

31:08.347 --> 31:10.508
that means they must've
switched it
for the original.

31:10.583 --> 31:13.074
l'll bet Brooks
has his guys go around...

31:13.152 --> 31:16.144
and case
rich people's houses
for art objects...

31:16.222 --> 31:18.247
when they're in there
installing the alarm system.

31:18.324 --> 31:21.054
Yeah, and then Shawn has
somebody like Speed Miller...

31:21.127 --> 31:23.391
paint perfect reproductions.

31:23.996 --> 31:27.591
And then they come back
and switch the originals
for the forgeries.

31:27.666 --> 31:29.031
Nice little scam.

31:29.101 --> 31:31.592
l assume you have
something in mind.

31:31.737 --> 31:32.795
Yes.

31:33.172 --> 31:35.902
This calls
for something rich.

31:45.584 --> 31:47.575
Hannibal,
this plan of yours stinks.

31:47.653 --> 31:48.745
Give it a chance, B.A.

31:48.821 --> 31:51.415
Besides, you can use
some new clothes.

31:55.361 --> 31:56.726
Your names?

31:58.063 --> 31:59.428
What do you need
our names for?

31:59.498 --> 32:01.591
That's Templeton Peck.

32:02.101 --> 32:04.126
Yes, Mr. Peck,
we're expecting you.

32:04.203 --> 32:07.434
You see, B.A.,
you can't get in here
without a reservation.

32:08.007 --> 32:09.201
A reservation?

32:09.275 --> 32:11.038
Just to buy clothes?

32:15.014 --> 32:16.242
Hi, Elliot.

32:16.315 --> 32:18.613
Mr. Peck, how marvelous
to see you again!

32:18.684 --> 32:19.673
How are you?

32:19.752 --> 32:21.379
Well, l'm fine,
thank you.

32:21.454 --> 32:23.945
My goodness,
it's been almost six months,
hasn't it?

32:24.023 --> 32:25.547
(Face)
Yes, l'm afraid it has.

32:25.624 --> 32:28.058
Elliot, l'd like you
to meet Mr. B.A. Baracus.

32:30.996 --> 32:33.931
Always a pleasure to meet
friends of Mr. Peck's.

32:33.999 --> 32:35.899
Gentlemen, won't you
step this way?

32:35.968 --> 32:37.162
Surely.

32:41.907 --> 32:44.273
Now, what can l do
for you today?

32:44.343 --> 32:46.174
A new tuxedo, perhaps?

32:46.312 --> 32:47.540
How are those
custom shirts...

32:47.613 --> 32:49.240
we designed for you
holding out?

32:49.315 --> 32:50.782
Well actually,
Elliot...

32:50.850 --> 32:53.375
our friend,
Mr. Baracus here...

32:53.452 --> 32:55.420
is in need
of a new suit.

32:58.624 --> 33:00.489
Yes.
Yes.

33:01.193 --> 33:02.785
Refreshing idea.

33:13.906 --> 33:16.602
Oh dear, l seem to have
run out of tape.

33:21.914 --> 33:24.712
l assume you'll want
to change footwear?

33:24.917 --> 33:28.819
What would you say
to a new ltalian loafer,
Mr. Baracus?

33:28.888 --> 33:30.617
l say you put your hands
on my boots...

33:30.689 --> 33:32.623
and l'm gonna throw you
through that window.

33:32.691 --> 33:34.682
Well, perhaps instead of
an ltalian loafer...

33:34.760 --> 33:36.728
we have some fine
crushed velvet.

33:36.795 --> 33:38.456
l said no shoes.

33:40.933 --> 33:42.400
l warned you.

34:15.668 --> 34:17.158
l said no tie!

34:30.248 --> 34:32.842
(Face)
Very nice, Elliot.
Very nice.

34:33.552 --> 34:35.452
Yes, sir.
You, too, B.A.

34:35.788 --> 34:37.415
l don't think
it goes with my boots.

34:37.489 --> 34:40.322
Oh, you're a sports figure,
B.A. lt'll be fine.

34:40.391 --> 34:44.089
Now, is there anything
you might need
in the way of jewelry?

34:44.630 --> 34:45.790
[chuckles]

34:45.864 --> 34:46.888
No.

34:47.166 --> 34:48.565
l guess not.

34:52.271 --> 34:53.260
[birds chirping]

34:57.109 --> 34:58.508
Well, gentlemen...

34:58.577 --> 35:01.068
Ms. Planson here,
has graciously agreed...

35:01.146 --> 35:03.080
to allow Mr. Baracus...

35:03.148 --> 35:06.242
a trial run of the house,
shall we say, for two days.

35:06.318 --> 35:08.980
What about a tennis court?
l didn't see no tennis court.

35:09.054 --> 35:10.919
l'm afraid
it doesn't have
a tennis court.

35:10.990 --> 35:13.015
Well, we could
put in a tennis court,
couldn't we?

35:13.092 --> 35:14.559
We have to
move a few trees--

35:14.627 --> 35:15.685
What about a stove?

35:15.761 --> 35:16.989
A stove?

35:17.229 --> 35:18.821
ls it gas or electric?

35:18.897 --> 35:19.921
lt's electric.

35:19.999 --> 35:21.364
l like gas.

35:22.101 --> 35:23.295
Well...

35:23.669 --> 35:26.297
l've got electric
and it gets real hot.

35:26.739 --> 35:28.104
Why don't
we give it a try?

35:28.173 --> 35:29.367
Look, Mr. Baracus--

35:29.441 --> 35:31.272
This house
don't have enough windows.

35:31.343 --> 35:32.742
l like more windows.

35:32.811 --> 35:35.609
Listen, maybe this isn't
exactly what you're looking
for after all.

35:35.681 --> 35:38.479
Well, now,
wait a second, Ms. Planson.

35:38.817 --> 35:42.218
Mr. Baracus,
why--why don't you listen
to the advice...

35:42.287 --> 35:45.313
of your manager here,
and give the place a try?

35:45.391 --> 35:46.983
What do you say?

35:50.996 --> 35:52.861
Okay, l'll sign.

35:53.632 --> 35:54.792
Great.

35:55.200 --> 35:56.428
You got a gymnasium?

35:56.502 --> 35:58.026
[clears throat]

35:59.038 --> 36:00.335
Prima donna.

36:02.107 --> 36:04.337
That's very nice, Peggy.
You've got a lot of talent.

36:04.410 --> 36:05.570
Thanks, Face.

36:05.644 --> 36:08.408
This certainly is
different from painting
in my little apartment.

36:08.480 --> 36:10.175
Yeah, well,
when Hannibal has a plan...

36:10.249 --> 36:12.547
l like to see it
go first class.

36:12.985 --> 36:15.977
Listen, l want to
thank you guys for everything
you're doing for Speed.

36:16.055 --> 36:17.647
l know you don't know him
very well...

36:17.723 --> 36:19.418
but he's really
a special person.

36:19.491 --> 36:21.186
He didn't deserve
what happened to him.

36:21.260 --> 36:22.693
Yeah, l can promise you
one thing.

36:22.761 --> 36:25.195
We're going to make
those guys pay
for what they did to him.

36:25.264 --> 36:26.526
[birds chirping]

36:26.598 --> 36:27.587
Peg...

36:27.666 --> 36:29.964
how's my original
Renoir coming?

36:30.135 --> 36:32.968
lncluding drying time,
you should have it
tomorrow morning.

36:33.038 --> 36:34.062
10:00?

36:34.139 --> 36:35.401
Terrific.

36:40.212 --> 36:41.304
Hello...

36:41.380 --> 36:44.076
l'd like to make
an appointment to have
my house inspected...

36:44.149 --> 36:46.743
for the installation
of a security system.

36:46.819 --> 36:48.844
(Brooks)
My assistants will
go through each room...

36:48.921 --> 36:50.286
and take down
the measurements.

36:50.355 --> 36:53.483
They'll take some snapshots
of the views to evaluate
the accessibility...

36:53.559 --> 36:55.083
of the windows.

36:55.194 --> 36:56.855
Then l'll give you
our estimates...

36:56.929 --> 36:58.226
and go over
our various plans...

36:58.297 --> 37:00.128
and see if we can't secure
your home for you.

37:00.199 --> 37:01.166
That'll be fine, sir.

37:01.233 --> 37:04.794
We also stock
supplemental alarm systems
for specific items...

37:04.870 --> 37:06.360
like this painting,
for instance...

37:06.438 --> 37:08.497
if it was worth
an excessive amount.

37:08.574 --> 37:10.838
Well, l see you're not
a connoisseur of art,
Mr. Brooks.

37:10.909 --> 37:11.933
Because if you were...

37:12.010 --> 37:15.446
you'd know that
that painting
is a very valuable piece.

37:16.815 --> 37:17.839
Really?

37:17.916 --> 37:19.747
lt is a lost Renoir.

37:21.086 --> 37:23.020
lt was found
in a villa in France.

37:23.088 --> 37:24.885
lt must have been
hidden for 40 years.

37:24.957 --> 37:26.356
l just acquired it
last month.

37:26.425 --> 37:28.359
Well, then l'd imagine
something that rare...

37:28.427 --> 37:30.224
would be worth
a considerable amount.

37:30.295 --> 37:31.922
That's why you're here.

37:31.997 --> 37:34.727
l want that picture
made theft-proof.

37:34.967 --> 37:36.594
Well, don't worry.

37:36.668 --> 37:40.126
l'm sure we can do something
very special for you here.

37:46.011 --> 37:47.842
(Shawn)
This is Renoir's long lost...

37:47.913 --> 37:49.642
Young Girl
Arranging Earrings.

37:49.715 --> 37:52.240
Hasn't been seen
since the start of
the Second World War.

37:52.317 --> 37:54.376
lt was thought destroyed
all these years.

37:54.453 --> 37:56.250
How much is it worth?

37:56.388 --> 37:59.880
l'd estimate between
$1 million and $1 .5 million.

38:00.893 --> 38:03.919
l'll call my broker in Sweden
and have him arrange a buyer.

38:04.763 --> 38:08.199
Murdock should have
our reproduction ready
in 24 hours.

38:11.103 --> 38:12.365
Hey, hey, hey!

38:13.205 --> 38:14.672
l'll take care of this,
all right?

38:14.740 --> 38:17.436
Well, that'll be
$5.50, without the tip.

38:17.509 --> 38:19.204
Oh, yeah?
Well, here's $7.

38:19.278 --> 38:20.711
Keep the change.

38:20.779 --> 38:21.939
Enjoy.

38:22.848 --> 38:24.008
Enjoy.

38:27.386 --> 38:29.013
So, if you approve,
Mr. Smith...

38:29.087 --> 38:31.351
we can have your painting
wired and secured today...

38:31.423 --> 38:33.254
and finish the rest
of your house tomorrow.

38:33.325 --> 38:35.691
Well, you have
a very fine reputation.

38:35.761 --> 38:36.955
So let's do it.

38:37.029 --> 38:39.463
Good, we'll get started
immediately.

38:39.531 --> 38:42.500
And to show you
our appreciation
of your trust in us...

38:42.568 --> 38:44.058
l'd like to take you
out to lunch.

38:44.136 --> 38:45.569
Well, that's not
at all necessary.

38:45.637 --> 38:47.935
Please, be my guest,
you and your friend.

38:48.006 --> 38:49.337
l know a wonderful spot.

38:49.408 --> 38:53.674
Good food, good music,
and an endless supply
of gorgeous young ladies.

39:00.452 --> 39:01.441
[[[music playing]

39:01.520 --> 39:03.215
How long will it take
your technicians?

39:03.288 --> 39:06.815
Not long. ln fact,
they should be leaving
any minute now.

39:13.398 --> 39:14.990
[birds chirping]

41:46.685 --> 41:48.653
[dogs barking]

42:15.781 --> 42:16.770
Hi, guys.

42:16.848 --> 42:17.837
Hi, Face.

42:17.916 --> 42:20.248
Now, l've got a gun
pointed right at your belly.

42:20.318 --> 42:21.979
Well, l guess
we're covered.

42:22.054 --> 42:23.885
This whole thing was a setup,
wasn't it?

42:23.955 --> 42:26.185
The mansion, the painting.
Murdock, too.

42:26.258 --> 42:27.486
You're pretty quick.

42:27.559 --> 42:29.322
You watch
a lot of game shows, huh?

42:29.394 --> 42:31.453
You know, if l were three feet
in front of a bullet...

42:31.530 --> 42:33.657
l don't think l'd be cracking
so many jokes.

42:34.132 --> 42:36.327
l knew this plan
wouldn't work, Hannibal.

42:36.401 --> 42:37.390
Hannibal?

42:37.469 --> 42:39.266
Yeah. Hannibal Smith.

42:39.771 --> 42:40.829
We're the A-Team.

42:40.906 --> 42:42.100
Maybe
you've heard of us?

42:42.174 --> 42:44.074
Yeah, l've heard of you.

42:44.142 --> 42:45.473
[laughing]

42:45.677 --> 42:47.076
How about that, huh?

42:47.145 --> 42:49.010
l captured the A-Team.

42:50.382 --> 42:52.407
Hey, there's a bounty
on your heads, isn't there?

42:52.484 --> 42:53.917
Yeah, dead or alive,
l think.

42:53.985 --> 42:57.284
Okay, Blair,
here's your chance
to earn some bonus money.

42:57.355 --> 42:59.414
Now you fill these guys
with a couple pounds
of lead...

42:59.491 --> 43:01.425
and you turn them over
to the Military Police.

43:01.493 --> 43:02.926
Then meet me
back at the gallery.

43:02.994 --> 43:04.359
l got a message for Murdock...

43:04.429 --> 43:06.761
and l wanna deliver it
to him personally.

43:06.832 --> 43:08.925
Use my car and...

43:09.201 --> 43:11.101
you be sure
and make it painful, huh?

43:11.169 --> 43:12.568
My pleasure.

43:12.637 --> 43:14.434
Come with me, Tepper.

43:15.307 --> 43:17.400
Come on,
let's move it. Now!

43:18.276 --> 43:20.608
(Blair)
Nice and easy,
pretty boy.

43:22.881 --> 43:24.849
[exclaims]
Hey, watch it!

43:25.183 --> 43:26.514
[exclaims]

43:26.585 --> 43:28.314
[people chattering]

43:30.288 --> 43:31.346
Come on.

43:31.423 --> 43:32.583
You were wonderful.

43:32.657 --> 43:33.919
[sighing]

43:38.296 --> 43:40.287
We'd like
Mr. Brooks' car.

43:40.499 --> 43:41.659
Well, l don't....

43:41.733 --> 43:43.064
Yeah, now!

43:43.168 --> 43:45.136
Yes, sir!
This way, here.

43:50.675 --> 43:53.303
We'll bring it back
as soon as we can.

43:53.378 --> 43:54.902
Take your time.

44:02.187 --> 44:04.451
(Brooks)
By now, your friends
should be just a bad memory.

44:04.523 --> 44:05.581
Now it's your turn.

44:05.657 --> 44:08.626
Not necessarily,
my friends have perfected
the art of escape.

44:08.693 --> 44:09.819
l wouldn't count on it.

44:09.895 --> 44:12.864
Not unless your friends
have perfected coming back
from the dead.

44:25.610 --> 44:27.077
[guns firing]

44:42.093 --> 44:43.321
[groans]

44:51.169 --> 44:53.103
Murdock, it's all right.

44:53.171 --> 44:54.638
[guns firing]

45:19.231 --> 45:21.426
Look on the bright side, pal.

45:21.600 --> 45:23.465
We didn't dent your Mercedes.

45:29.641 --> 45:31.700
(Peggy)
We're glad you guys
hung around long enough...

45:31.776 --> 45:33.004
for us to say thank you.

45:33.078 --> 45:34.067
lt's a pleasure.

45:34.145 --> 45:36.272
Now all those bad guys
are in jail for good.

45:36.348 --> 45:38.248
And all the stolen
masterpieces...

45:38.316 --> 45:40.375
have been returned
to their rightful owners.

45:40.452 --> 45:43.421
And we're happy
to report that we have
a refund. Face.

45:43.488 --> 45:44.887
Right, yeah.

45:45.090 --> 45:47.650
Well, let's see,
we had lunch at the bistro.

45:47.726 --> 45:49.956
That was, $1 23...

45:50.128 --> 45:52.961
B.A.'s suit,
that's $657...

45:53.031 --> 45:55.864
the rental
of the Excalibur,
$1 20 a day for two days...

45:55.934 --> 45:59.700
that's $240 plus gas.

45:59.771 --> 46:03.901
And there's our usual fee,
four men for two days and....

46:03.975 --> 46:05.772
Look, you can just
read it if you like.

46:05.844 --> 46:07.175
The point is...

46:07.245 --> 46:11.272
the balance from all this
comes to $8,000.

46:12.317 --> 46:14.785
Which is still plenty
for you to get that
Harvard education...

46:14.853 --> 46:16.718
if you ever decide to.

46:17.756 --> 46:19.280
[seagulls cawing]

46:19.357 --> 46:22.155
Hey, Murdock,
you crazy fool!
Don't put that in my van!

46:22.227 --> 46:24.354
But l got to!
These are the tools
that l need...

46:24.429 --> 46:25.919
to develop
my artistic self, man.

46:25.997 --> 46:27.862
You're gonna develop
a lump on your head...

46:27.932 --> 46:29.365
if you don't get
rid of that junk!

46:29.434 --> 46:31.664
l can't do that.
l just can't do it.
l can't stand here...

46:31.736 --> 46:35.137
and just watch myself
throw away
my whole new career.

46:35.206 --> 46:36.468
Well, watch me do it then.

46:36.541 --> 46:38.133
Get out of here.

46:41.780 --> 46:43.338
(Face)
Don't take it so hard,
Murdock.

46:43.415 --> 46:44.814
There'll be other careers.

46:44.883 --> 46:47.317
What makes this
such a sad moment for me...

46:47.385 --> 46:49.046
is that the whole time
l was locked...

46:49.120 --> 46:52.749
in that dark, dingy,
dusty, dank dungeon...

46:53.058 --> 46:55.720
there was only one face
that kept popping
into my head.

46:55.794 --> 46:57.523
Yeah? Who was that?

46:57.929 --> 46:58.987
B.A.

46:59.831 --> 47:01.696
Now he's turned on me.

47:02.067 --> 47:03.625
Thank you so much.

47:03.702 --> 47:05.033
Good luck.

47:05.804 --> 47:07.101
Good luck.

47:07.172 --> 47:08.969
Okay, guys, let's go.

47:17.716 --> 47:19.240
No, not my lucky brush!

47:19.317 --> 47:21.808
Not my paintbrush!
That's my lucky paintbrush!

47:21.886 --> 47:22.978
That's it, Murdock!

47:23.054 --> 47:25.352
l don't wanna hear
another word
about your painting...

47:25.423 --> 47:27.721
because you can't
paint nothing.

47:28.626 --> 47:29.854
[grunts]

47:30.895 --> 47:32.658
''Can't paint nothing.''

47:33.164 --> 47:35.291
The man knows
where he's going...

47:35.500 --> 47:37.798
but he hasn't
checked his flanks.
