00:29.129 --> 00:30.892
See you later, honey.

02:46.499 --> 02:48.899
We still need 40 dozens, standard.

02:52.138 --> 02:54.106
No more uncuts. That's enough.

03:17.330 --> 03:18.729
So, Blanca, did you see him?

03:20.500 --> 03:22.434
I waited by the plaza but he never came.

03:25.805 --> 03:27.773
- How long did you wait?
- Don't laugh.

03:27.840 --> 03:29.501
I'm not laughing.

03:29.576 --> 03:31.407
Tell me how long you waited.

03:31.878 --> 03:34.369
I didn't really like him anyway.

03:34.447 --> 03:35.539
In any case...

03:36.716 --> 03:38.684
check out that guy over there.

03:44.857 --> 03:47.121
He looks at me and smiles like that
all the time.

04:20.226 --> 04:21.284
Maria...

04:21.394 --> 04:22.622
you want to go to your house?

04:22.695 --> 04:24.094
No, Juan.

04:24.163 --> 04:25.926
Where do you want to go then?

04:25.999 --> 04:27.296
I don't know. Somewhere else.

04:27.367 --> 04:29.665
Where?

04:30.637 --> 04:32.298
How about up there?

04:35.708 --> 04:37.300
The roof? Why there?

04:37.377 --> 04:38.901
Why not?

04:39.946 --> 04:41.413
Come on.

04:43.783 --> 04:45.546
It's not even that high.

04:46.319 --> 04:47.411
No.

04:47.553 --> 04:50.579
What are you, crazy?

04:51.024 --> 04:54.118
See how you treat me, Juan? You're a drag.

04:54.927 --> 04:56.554
Let's not get started with this, okay?

04:57.630 --> 04:59.120
If I go up, will you follow me?

04:59.499 --> 05:01.160
Then what?

05:01.234 --> 05:02.667
Are we gonna do it up there?

05:12.211 --> 05:15.442
Come down and we'll go to your house.

05:17.116 --> 05:18.276
Come down.

05:32.532 --> 05:34.261
Come on. It's your turn.

05:34.567 --> 05:35.864
No way.

05:37.303 --> 05:39.294
Come up. I have to tell you something.

05:40.807 --> 05:43.605
You know what, I'm gonna take off.

05:43.810 --> 05:46.643
Then go. I'm not moving.

05:47.613 --> 05:51.310
You can come down the way you went up.
Alone. See ya.

06:01.994 --> 06:04.792
I'm really worried. He's constipated.

06:06.032 --> 06:07.329
What are you doing?

06:07.400 --> 06:09.595
He hasn't shit in two days.

06:09.669 --> 06:12.365
Diana, relax. He'll go when he goes.

06:12.438 --> 06:13.735
Don't bother him.

06:13.806 --> 06:16.001
Maria, don't comb your hair
in the dining room.

06:16.075 --> 06:18.942
Diana, he's cranky because
you're kneading his stomach...

06:19.011 --> 06:20.638
like a ball of dough.

06:20.713 --> 06:22.237
Come here, Pachito.

06:25.385 --> 06:28.582
You're scaring him, Maria.

06:28.654 --> 06:30.645
Diana, pass him to me.

06:31.157 --> 06:32.852
Come, sit down.

06:37.930 --> 06:40.592
Mom, will you fix a tea for him?

06:40.666 --> 06:44.898
You know those teas don't do anything.

06:44.971 --> 06:47.098
Take him to the doctor.

06:47.173 --> 06:48.970
No, Grandma, I don't trust that doctor.

06:49.442 --> 06:51.307
You don't have to take him anywhere.

06:51.444 --> 06:53.275
He's fine.

06:55.748 --> 06:57.113
What are you looking for?

06:57.683 --> 07:00.174
I'm not sure, Grandma.
I don't feel like bread.

07:54.040 --> 07:56.338
I said the white ones at 40.
What happened?

07:59.345 --> 08:00.505
Sir.

08:09.055 --> 08:10.079
What's wrong?

08:10.490 --> 08:11.548
Can I go to the bathroom?

08:11.624 --> 08:12.613
Again?

08:12.959 --> 08:14.722
I don't feel well.

08:14.994 --> 08:17.929
You're four bins under this hour,
and three last hour.

08:17.997 --> 08:20.795
How will you catch up
if you're in the bathroom all the time?

08:20.867 --> 08:22.630
Please, I'll be quick.

08:23.035 --> 08:26.436
I have 84 workers in this section...

08:26.706 --> 08:29.641
and everyone else puts their head down
and does their job.

08:29.709 --> 08:32.940
But with you, it's like a
constant tug-of-war.

08:33.479 --> 08:35.037
At this point I don't know what to...

08:35.515 --> 08:38.279
What the hell? What's wrong with you?

08:38.551 --> 08:40.519
Look at this mess. This is disgusting.

08:41.287 --> 08:43.015
What are you going to do with these now?

08:43.289 --> 08:45.018
Tell me. What are you going to do?

08:49.128 --> 08:50.186
Pick them up.

08:51.531 --> 08:52.964
Take them over there.

09:00.039 --> 09:01.267
Hurry up.

09:05.978 --> 09:07.343
Clean them.

09:08.614 --> 09:10.047
Be careful of the buds.

09:10.583 --> 09:11.880
But if they're already ruined.

09:12.418 --> 09:14.352
I don't care. Clean them off.

09:16.222 --> 09:18.656
I want all those roses clean.

09:19.458 --> 09:21.949
And when you're done with that
you can go back...

09:22.028 --> 09:24.019
and make up what you owe me.

09:24.730 --> 09:25.754
Is that clear?

09:25.831 --> 09:27.162
Yes, sir.

09:52.058 --> 09:53.355
Is everything okay?

09:53.626 --> 09:55.992
It's 9,600.

09:56.062 --> 09:57.689
Maria, give me the money.

09:58.130 --> 10:00.928
- And why should I pay?
- It's for Pacho. He started vomiting.

10:01.200 --> 10:02.394
Where's your money?

10:02.668 --> 10:03.726
Maria.

10:03.803 --> 10:07.762
I give up all I make and Diana doesn't
put in anything.

10:07.907 --> 10:10.375
And I have to pay for the kid's medicine?

10:10.576 --> 10:12.134
Don't start with me, Maria.

10:12.278 --> 10:13.745
Just give me the money.

10:21.721 --> 10:24.815
You can keep the money
from your next check.

10:25.257 --> 10:27.987
I don't know why everything
is so difficult with you.

10:32.465 --> 10:34.456
Well, there won't be a next check.

10:36.002 --> 10:37.401
Because I quit my job.

10:37.570 --> 10:38.559
What?

10:39.472 --> 10:40.461
When?

10:40.706 --> 10:41.695
Today.

10:41.774 --> 10:42.900
But why?

10:45.044 --> 10:46.909
They wouldn't let me go to the bathroom.

10:46.979 --> 10:48.708
Not once?

10:48.781 --> 10:51.409
It's not just that.
I don't like how they treat me.

10:51.484 --> 10:53.145
So what are you going to do now?

10:53.219 --> 10:55.278
You are so stupid, Maria.

10:55.354 --> 10:56.412
Why don't you shut up?

10:56.489 --> 10:58.582
Don't tell me to shut up.

10:58.658 --> 11:01.684
- They treated me like shit.
- Why can't you just deal?

11:01.761 --> 11:05.288
- Why should I put up with it?
- Why don't you think of the family?

11:05.364 --> 11:06.854
Quiet! That's enough.

11:06.932 --> 11:10.129
- You have to go and apologize to your boss.
- I'm not going back.

11:10.202 --> 11:12.932
- What are you going to do?
- I'll find another job.

11:13.205 --> 11:15.696
Another job?
There's nothing but flowers here.

11:15.775 --> 11:17.333
At least it's a decent job.

11:17.610 --> 11:19.475
Please, what's decent about it?

11:19.545 --> 11:21.945
Maria, go back and apologize.

11:22.381 --> 11:23.507
Aren't you listening?

11:23.649 --> 11:25.139
I am not going back.

11:25.251 --> 11:27.014
I'm not going back, and that's it.

11:35.828 --> 11:37.819
She quit and left him standing there.

11:37.897 --> 11:39.694
Well done. This deserves a toast.

11:40.166 --> 11:42.134
Bottoms up.

11:42.201 --> 11:44.362
Because she kicks ass.

11:44.737 --> 11:47.331
Come on. Down the hatch.

12:39.225 --> 12:41.921
Blanca, look. Isn't that your boyfriend?

12:44.163 --> 12:45.187
Oh, my God.

12:45.464 --> 12:46.658
Ask him to dance.

12:46.732 --> 12:48.791
No way. You're crazy.

12:48.868 --> 12:50.836
Come on, don't be stupid.

12:54.173 --> 12:55.265
Hi.

12:55.441 --> 12:56.408
Hi.

12:56.475 --> 12:58.204
This is Blanca and I'm Maria.

12:58.544 --> 13:00.512
I'm Felipe and this is my cousin Franklin.

13:00.579 --> 13:01.568
What's up?

13:02.681 --> 13:03.807
She wants to dance with you.

13:05.484 --> 13:06.678
Go for it.

13:07.620 --> 13:08.644
You want to dance?

13:10.756 --> 13:11.882
Sure.

13:12.258 --> 13:13.350
Let's dance, then.

13:30.676 --> 13:31.734
Juan, I want to dance.

13:31.811 --> 13:33.210
Hold on.

13:34.713 --> 13:36.806
Hold this for me.

13:37.183 --> 13:38.707
All right, let's go.

13:40.219 --> 13:41.914
Spin, spin, spin.

13:41.987 --> 13:43.579
What's wrong with you?

13:43.889 --> 13:44.913
What?

13:48.427 --> 13:50.019
Another drink.

14:00.472 --> 14:01.496
Hey.

14:01.974 --> 14:03.339
You want to dance?

14:06.545 --> 14:07.807
What do you say?

14:08.647 --> 14:09.636
Okay.

14:09.715 --> 14:11.012
Let's go.

15:18.250 --> 15:19.342
Juan.

15:19.885 --> 15:21.250
Hold on.

15:21.453 --> 15:23.011
Maria, I'll see you later.

15:23.088 --> 15:24.112
Bye, Blanca.

15:31.997 --> 15:33.396
All right, then.

16:16.709 --> 16:18.540
Juan, I have something to tell you.

16:21.180 --> 16:22.204
What is it?

16:25.617 --> 16:27.050
I think I'm pregnant.

16:32.191 --> 16:33.658
Are you sure?

16:34.326 --> 16:36.521
- You're not fucking with me, right?
- No.

16:37.262 --> 16:39.287
I've missed my last two periods.

16:40.165 --> 16:41.189
What are you going to do?

16:41.266 --> 16:42.324
I don't know.

16:44.670 --> 16:45.864
Who else knows?

16:46.071 --> 16:47.060
Only you.

16:47.139 --> 16:48.128
No one else?

16:48.207 --> 16:49.799
You want everyone to know?

16:49.875 --> 16:52.673
I bet Blanca already knows.

16:52.745 --> 16:54.645
No, Blanca doesn't know.

17:04.823 --> 17:06.050
Maria.

17:07.893 --> 17:09.258
Do you want to get married?

17:14.233 --> 17:16.565
- Are you joking?
- Why?

17:18.270 --> 17:20.704
- Where would we live?
- My house.

17:20.873 --> 17:24.673
There're ten people in your house.
You share a bedroom with your brother.

17:24.742 --> 17:26.438
So where do you want to live?

17:26.512 --> 17:27.877
My house would be better.

17:27.980 --> 17:29.743
Right, a lot better.

17:29.815 --> 17:33.307
A guy living in his girl's house. No way.

17:33.385 --> 17:34.875
You're so fucking stupid.

17:34.953 --> 17:38.354
Stupid? Your family hates me.
Why should I live there?

17:38.424 --> 17:40.858
We're better off in my house.
The more the merrier.

17:41.026 --> 17:44.052
Why don't you want to get married?
I'm stepping up to this.

17:48.400 --> 17:49.424
Juan, do you love me?

17:49.968 --> 17:51.993
Oh, not that again.

17:52.071 --> 17:54.631
Look me in the eye and tell me
you really love me.

17:56.375 --> 17:58.935
What kind of person are you?

17:59.778 --> 18:02.440
You're gonna marry someone
you don't even love?

18:02.514 --> 18:03.913
Someone who doesn't love you?

18:04.750 --> 18:08.846
How many months or days
before you're sleeping with another woman?

18:08.921 --> 18:10.513
That's not gonna happen.

18:10.956 --> 18:14.221
I don't want to end up like my sister.

18:14.293 --> 18:18.525
Sorry, but your sister was an idiot
who screwed the first guy that walked by.

18:18.597 --> 18:21.395
- Shut up.
- It's true. And now she's stuck with a kid.

18:21.467 --> 18:23.196
Don't talk about my sister like that.

18:23.268 --> 18:25.600
Maria, I am not going anywhere
and you know it.

18:25.771 --> 18:27.932
That doesn't matter. I am not marrying you.

18:28.040 --> 18:30.099
Sorry to break it to you,
but you'll have to.

18:30.242 --> 18:31.266
No, Juan.

18:31.477 --> 18:33.035
I don't have to do anything.

18:33.645 --> 18:35.169
That's the way you are, Maria.

18:35.347 --> 18:36.405
You are so stubborn.

18:37.049 --> 18:39.244
You're an idiot, and a loser.

18:39.384 --> 18:42.182
Most guys would've left by now.
I don't know why I stand you.

18:42.254 --> 18:43.687
Then don't.

18:45.457 --> 18:46.981
I'm not in love with you.

18:49.128 --> 18:50.220
Me neither.

18:52.364 --> 18:53.353
Perfect.

19:47.553 --> 19:48.542
What's up?

19:48.687 --> 19:49.676
How are you?

19:50.088 --> 19:51.555
Where are you going?

19:52.291 --> 19:53.553
To Bogota.

19:55.561 --> 19:56.789
Hop on. I'll give you a ride.

19:56.862 --> 19:57.920
To Bogota?

19:57.996 --> 19:59.020
Of course, I'll take you.

20:42.374 --> 20:44.239
I like the way you dance.

20:44.810 --> 20:45.834
Really?

20:45.944 --> 20:47.241
You, too.

20:50.282 --> 20:54.184
I didn't think people could dance around
here. Thought they were all stiff.

20:56.488 --> 20:58.149
Where are you from?

20:59.157 --> 21:00.385
I'm from a little town.

21:02.327 --> 21:04.158
Santa Rosa de Cabal.

21:04.229 --> 21:06.322
About ten minutes from Pereira.

21:07.032 --> 21:08.465
You know it?

21:08.533 --> 21:09.557
No.

21:11.169 --> 21:13.228
There are some great hot springs over there.

21:13.338 --> 21:14.464
Someday I'll take you there.

21:16.875 --> 21:17.864
Yeah?

21:20.612 --> 21:22.409
What are you going to Bogota for?

21:27.786 --> 21:29.651
I'm going because...

21:29.721 --> 21:31.382
I have a friend who works there.

21:32.124 --> 21:35.992
She works for a wealthy family,
in their house. She's going to help me out.

21:37.162 --> 21:39.858
- Don't laugh.
- I'm sorry.

21:40.999 --> 21:42.796
It's just that...

21:43.635 --> 21:46.331
you're way too pretty to be working
as a maid.

21:46.738 --> 21:50.105
Too cute to get dressed up
in that hat and apron.

21:51.543 --> 21:55.343
Anyway, I was just going to check it out.

21:55.414 --> 21:57.041
Nothing was certain.

22:11.463 --> 22:12.691
Listen.

22:16.268 --> 22:19.931
If you're looking for work
I might be able to hook you up.

22:20.806 --> 22:22.103
Hook me up?

22:24.976 --> 22:26.238
It involves traveling.

22:27.245 --> 22:28.303
Traveling?

22:28.747 --> 22:29.907
Tell me.

22:32.617 --> 22:33.709
Working as a mule.

22:38.123 --> 22:40.091
It's a cool job.

22:40.158 --> 22:43.025
You go, hand off the stuff, get your cash
and that's it.

22:43.095 --> 22:44.119
Everything's cool.

22:45.897 --> 22:48.593
What about the people on the news?

22:48.667 --> 22:51.067
The ones in prisons far away.
What about them?

22:52.637 --> 22:54.434
They're the ones who want to be famous.

22:54.506 --> 22:58.306
They get caught, get on TV, everyone sees
them, and they become famous.

22:58.844 --> 23:00.106
I don't want to be famous.

23:01.546 --> 23:03.912
I know a guy who can set it all up.

23:04.216 --> 23:06.810
Takes care of the papers,
makes the arrangements.

23:10.989 --> 23:12.320
Know what? Forget it.

23:14.159 --> 23:15.251
Let's go.

23:16.328 --> 23:17.488
No, hold on.

23:22.667 --> 23:25.067
How much would I get?

24:07.179 --> 24:08.476
You want something to drink?

24:09.748 --> 24:12.717
Give me a beer and a soda for her.

24:13.385 --> 24:15.876
I'm going to talk to this guy.
I'll be right back.

24:16.054 --> 24:18.420
You're all right?

24:39.344 --> 24:40.572
All set.

24:50.188 --> 24:51.212
Let's go.

24:57.996 --> 24:59.520
Come in. Sit down.

25:04.603 --> 25:06.935
So you and Franklin are friends.

25:08.273 --> 25:10.036
How do you two know each other?

25:11.743 --> 25:15.440
She's a friend of the family.
Through my cousin.

25:15.780 --> 25:17.577
Your cousin.

25:19.384 --> 25:20.817
You're looking for work?

25:21.920 --> 25:23.046
Yes, sir.

25:23.622 --> 25:25.146
Where were you working?

25:25.457 --> 25:27.118
In a flower plantation.

25:27.692 --> 25:29.216
And what happened?

25:30.028 --> 25:32.428
I didn't get along with my boss...

25:32.664 --> 25:33.824
so I left.

25:34.566 --> 25:36.932
Rebellious, then.

25:37.769 --> 25:39.396
No.

25:39.571 --> 25:42.631
You don't have a problem
taking directions?

25:43.141 --> 25:44.369
Orders?

25:44.442 --> 25:45.534
No, sir.

25:46.044 --> 25:47.807
Do you get scared easily?

25:49.581 --> 25:50.707
No.

25:52.217 --> 25:53.411
How old are you?

25:53.852 --> 25:55.319
Eighteen.

25:55.453 --> 25:56.613
Boyfriend?

25:59.257 --> 26:00.315
No.

26:02.093 --> 26:03.151
Yes or no?

26:03.862 --> 26:04.886
No.

26:05.230 --> 26:06.458
I don't have a boyfriend.

26:08.800 --> 26:10.028
All right, then.

26:10.735 --> 26:12.202
How's your system?

26:13.772 --> 26:14.739
My system?

26:16.141 --> 26:17.938
I mean, how's your stomach?

26:19.744 --> 26:21.974
Do you have problems with diarrhea?
Constipation?

26:22.047 --> 26:23.981
Digestive problems?

26:24.049 --> 26:26.074
None. No, sir.

26:26.618 --> 26:28.142
Big eater?

26:29.854 --> 26:31.014
Normal.

26:35.527 --> 26:38.018
Okay, then...

26:38.563 --> 26:40.656
we are going to give you several rolls
of film.

26:41.700 --> 26:43.668
We'll send you to New York.

26:43.735 --> 26:47.171
Actually, to New Jersey,
a small town next to New York.

26:47.572 --> 26:49.699
Once you go though customs...

26:49.774 --> 26:52.607
you'll be met by our people.

26:52.777 --> 26:55.075
They will take you to a safe place.

26:55.146 --> 26:56.943
We'll develop the rolls.

26:58.116 --> 27:01.517
And in five or ten days
you'll be back here...

27:01.720 --> 27:04.416
with all your money taking care
of your problems.

27:05.690 --> 27:07.749
How much do I get?

27:09.594 --> 27:13.894
We'll give you $100 per roll.

27:14.766 --> 27:15.733
Keep in mind...

27:15.800 --> 27:18.997
we have to take care of your documents.

27:19.070 --> 27:22.972
Meaning that after we deduct the expenses
for the passport and visa...

27:23.041 --> 27:24.531
and for your papers...

27:24.609 --> 27:26.577
you'll have seven or eight million pesos.

27:32.651 --> 27:34.118
What if I get caught?

27:34.185 --> 27:35.516
And why would that happen?

27:35.920 --> 27:38.787
Unless you step off the plane
shaking like a leaf.

27:38.857 --> 27:41.325
Then they'll catch you.

27:41.459 --> 27:42.517
Obviously.

27:42.761 --> 27:45.321
But no worries.
Those gringos don't know a thing.

27:45.430 --> 27:46.522
Don't worry.

27:46.731 --> 27:47.823
Now...

27:48.266 --> 27:50.029
once your decision is made...

27:50.835 --> 27:52.598
there is no turning back.

27:53.805 --> 27:56.740
You can't tell anyone. Understand?

27:58.243 --> 27:59.301
Yes, sir.

27:59.878 --> 28:02.745
Now, I know you have a lot of problems
weighing on you...

28:02.814 --> 28:05.339
and you're in a difficult situation...

28:06.518 --> 28:08.850
and I don't want you making this decision...

28:09.020 --> 28:12.319
under that kind of pressure.

28:12.490 --> 28:14.685
So I'm going to give you this...

28:14.759 --> 28:16.818
so you can take care of some things.

28:18.463 --> 28:20.863
Actually, it's really not necessary.
Thank you.

28:21.566 --> 28:23.591
No, no, no. Take it. No obligations.

28:25.670 --> 28:27.001
Don't worry about it.

29:36.808 --> 29:38.673
You were in the bar, right?

29:39.944 --> 29:41.468
My name is Maria.

29:50.088 --> 29:51.521
I'm Lucy.

29:57.796 --> 29:59.161
Do you work for Javier?

30:01.766 --> 30:03.666
Is it hard?

30:06.771 --> 30:09.262
It's not easy, but it's not
too difficult either.

30:13.178 --> 30:15.203
How old are you?

30:15.280 --> 30:16.679
Seventeen.

30:17.515 --> 30:19.676
But I said I was eighteen.

30:22.187 --> 30:24.917
You just have to be prepared
and know how to do it right.

30:35.466 --> 30:37.297
Where have you been?

30:40.471 --> 30:41.904
I went to the city...

30:41.973 --> 30:44.806
to ask Jessica for help finding a job.

30:44.876 --> 30:46.241
What did she say?

30:48.079 --> 30:49.512
It's none of your business.

30:50.281 --> 30:51.873
Don't tell me it's not my business.

30:52.083 --> 30:53.482
It's not.

30:53.551 --> 30:56.850
You didn't find anything.
Or you would've said so.

30:56.988 --> 30:59.786
You have to go back to the plantation
and get your job back.

30:59.858 --> 31:00.882
No.

31:00.959 --> 31:03.860
It's not fair to Mom.
You know how hard it is for her.

31:03.928 --> 31:05.589
Now you're making things harder?

31:05.663 --> 31:06.687
Get off my back.

31:06.764 --> 31:09.631
Don't even... Pacho had
a 108 fever this morning.

31:09.701 --> 31:10.725
He's your son.

31:10.802 --> 31:13.794
- I know he's my son. So?
- He's your responsibility.

31:13.872 --> 31:16.466
Who do you think you are?
You have to find a job.

31:16.541 --> 31:17.667
Well, I got one.

31:17.742 --> 31:20.142
Yeah, like what? Cut the shit.

31:36.027 --> 31:37.255
At least I put in my share.

32:27.612 --> 32:28.874
Take this.

32:30.014 --> 32:31.311
Hold it in your mouth.

32:34.619 --> 32:36.314
Let it slide to the back.

32:37.322 --> 32:38.846
All the way.

32:43.628 --> 32:45.255
Open your throat.

32:45.663 --> 32:46.925
Now swallow.

32:52.937 --> 32:54.564
Practice with these.

32:56.841 --> 32:58.240
Can you swallow these?

33:10.722 --> 33:13.486
You can't eat anything for 24 hours
before the flight.

33:13.558 --> 33:16.049
Your stomach has to be totally empty.

33:16.461 --> 33:20.192
They may lie about how many you have
to swallow.

33:22.367 --> 33:23.959
How many will it be?

33:26.337 --> 33:28.805
For your size,
maybe 60 or 70 pellets.

33:30.074 --> 33:31.302
Really?

33:32.610 --> 33:34.271
Be glad you're small.

33:34.345 --> 33:35.437
Big guys have to swallow...

33:35.513 --> 33:37.447
like a hundred.

33:37.515 --> 33:39.449
Make sure they're well wrapped.

33:39.517 --> 33:42.213
If just one opens up you'll die.

33:43.955 --> 33:45.149
Wear nice clothes.

33:45.323 --> 33:49.350
Nothing flashy. You don't want to look like
a peasant showing off.

33:51.062 --> 33:53.656
How many times have you done this?

33:53.998 --> 33:54.987
Two.

33:57.969 --> 33:59.095
How'd it go?

34:04.475 --> 34:05.703
Still here.

34:11.616 --> 34:14.847
The first time I did it I was gonna go see
my older sister.

34:15.686 --> 34:18.746
She lives in New York and I haven't seen her
in four years.

34:20.891 --> 34:23.018
But when I got there I realized...

34:23.094 --> 34:24.891
I didn't know what to tell her.

34:26.464 --> 34:29.024
How was I going to explain why I was there?

34:29.100 --> 34:30.293
And how?

34:32.402 --> 34:33.802
I love her.

34:34.072 --> 34:35.664
But we're really different.

34:36.908 --> 34:40.105
She'd kill me if she found out
I was mixed up in this.

34:42.313 --> 34:44.213
The second time around...

34:44.282 --> 34:46.306
I made it to her house.

34:47.518 --> 34:49.076
But I couldn't knock on her door.

34:56.060 --> 34:57.493
What is America like?

35:00.765 --> 35:01.925
Over there...

35:03.835 --> 35:05.700
it's, like, too perfect.

35:07.872 --> 35:09.362
Everything's straight.

35:57.455 --> 35:58.615
So...

35:59.524 --> 36:00.752
how's that thing going?

36:00.825 --> 36:02.087
What thing?

36:02.827 --> 36:05.455
Your job. Tell me what you have to do.

36:05.530 --> 36:07.760
I told you not to talk about it.

36:21.245 --> 36:22.974
I talked to Franklin.

36:24.448 --> 36:25.813
I'm going to be a mule, too.

36:29.654 --> 36:30.814
You did what?

36:30.888 --> 36:32.788
You heard me. Why not?

36:32.857 --> 36:34.722
Because you can't.

36:34.892 --> 36:35.950
Yes, I can.

36:36.394 --> 36:38.191
What are you thinking?

36:38.863 --> 36:41.058
It's $5,000.

36:41.532 --> 36:43.090
You know how much that is in pesos?

36:44.268 --> 36:45.667
I figured it out.

36:45.903 --> 36:49.339
It's like 10 million pesos.
I can buy my family a house with that.

36:50.508 --> 36:51.907
No, Blanca, you're not going.

36:53.177 --> 36:56.237
You know what? I can do what I want.
I don't need your permission.

36:56.314 --> 36:57.679
Do you know what you're saying?

36:58.583 --> 37:00.414
You have to tell them you're not doing it.

37:00.818 --> 37:01.910
No.

37:03.487 --> 37:05.717
Anyway, I can't now.

37:06.724 --> 37:08.385
I already said yes.

37:19.237 --> 37:21.205
All the way to Chiquinquira?

37:21.405 --> 37:25.102
But you don't know anything about working
in an office.

37:26.043 --> 37:28.238
You don't think I'm smart enough?

37:28.312 --> 37:29.711
That's not what I said.

37:43.894 --> 37:46.590
I don't understand why you have to go
so far away.

38:44.522 --> 38:45.750
What's up?

39:10.981 --> 39:12.073
What's up?

39:12.149 --> 39:13.639
- How are you?
- All good.

39:23.094 --> 39:24.254
And Blanca?

39:25.930 --> 39:28.023
She's in another place.

39:35.172 --> 39:36.332
Don't worry, baby.

39:36.474 --> 39:38.704
Everything's gonna be all right.

39:40.778 --> 39:42.177
Give her a hand.

41:02.726 --> 41:04.660
These will slow your digestion.

41:04.728 --> 41:05.752
Take them.

41:15.606 --> 41:17.267
Open your mouth. Open.

41:35.793 --> 41:37.021
Here.

41:54.011 --> 41:55.808
Don't stick your fingers so far inside.

41:59.183 --> 42:01.845
If you can't do this, we'll stop right now.

42:02.186 --> 42:03.210
No.

42:03.287 --> 42:05.380
I know I can do it.

42:06.090 --> 42:07.079
Let's see.

42:15.699 --> 42:16.961
Relax.

42:20.604 --> 42:22.834
Let it slide down.

42:30.247 --> 42:31.509
Very good.

42:44.929 --> 42:47.454
- How many is it so far?
- Twenty-three.

42:50.868 --> 42:52.836
Come. Lay down.

43:14.525 --> 43:15.992
What are you doing?

43:16.427 --> 43:17.655
Setting them in place.

43:48.292 --> 43:50.157
You want more anesthetic?

44:22.726 --> 44:23.750
Let's see.

44:24.028 --> 44:25.290
This is...

44:25.629 --> 44:26.789
$800.

44:27.064 --> 44:29.055
You saved for the trip.

44:30.601 --> 44:32.125
The ticket.

44:33.937 --> 44:35.905
Round trip, one week.

44:35.973 --> 44:37.440
To New York.

44:37.508 --> 44:39.476
Your passport. With a visa.

44:47.751 --> 44:48.740
Look...

44:49.820 --> 44:52.015
You've got the name and address
of the hotel...

44:52.089 --> 44:54.114
where you say you're staying...

44:54.191 --> 44:56.216
while you're there.

44:56.593 --> 44:57.617
One more thing.

44:58.028 --> 44:59.893
If any of what you're carrying...

45:00.831 --> 45:03.265
gets lost along the way
or doesn't show up...

45:03.434 --> 45:05.698
we'll go and have a little conversation...

45:05.769 --> 45:07.600
with your grandmother, your mother...

45:07.671 --> 45:09.138
your sister...

45:09.206 --> 45:10.605
and little Pachito.

45:10.674 --> 45:11.971
We know exactly...

45:12.376 --> 45:14.674
how much each one of those
62 pellets weighs.

45:15.245 --> 45:16.712
Understood?

47:02.152 --> 47:04.086
I didn't know you were coming again.

47:04.154 --> 47:06.384
Me neither. It just happened.

47:07.090 --> 47:08.580
You know we're not the only ones?

47:08.659 --> 47:09.990
That's how it works.

47:10.060 --> 47:11.425
They send a bunch.

47:11.495 --> 47:14.396
If one gets stopped, it's easier
for the rest to get through.

47:36.186 --> 47:37.210
What are you doing?

47:37.387 --> 47:39.412
I saw you talking to that woman.
Who is she?

47:40.457 --> 47:42.220
She's...

47:42.860 --> 47:44.589
you know.

47:45.696 --> 47:47.994
See that woman with the curly hair
over there?

47:49.867 --> 47:51.300
She is, too.

47:51.368 --> 47:53.427
I met her with Franklin.

47:55.038 --> 47:57.029
I feel like I'm having my period.

47:57.708 --> 47:59.573
I feel like I have to go to the bathroom.

47:59.643 --> 48:00.974
Excuse me.

50:25.822 --> 50:27.449
I don't feel well.

50:29.593 --> 50:30.651
What are you going to do?

50:37.000 --> 50:38.524
Stay calm.

50:38.969 --> 50:41.836
As soon as we land, we'll get a doctor.

50:44.408 --> 50:45.705
I know.

50:47.878 --> 50:49.106
I know.

51:47.871 --> 51:50.271
I lost the hotel address.

51:51.441 --> 51:52.669
Do you know it?

51:53.710 --> 51:56.838
No, I always give them my sister's address.

52:01.418 --> 52:02.783
Do you have a pen?

52:17.400 --> 52:19.891
It's my sister's address in New York.

53:46.156 --> 53:47.088
Excuse me.

53:47.591 --> 53:50.458
May I see your passport,
declaration card, and ticket, please?

53:51.595 --> 53:54.393
Passport, declaration card, and ticket.

54:05.976 --> 54:07.739
Where are you arriving from?

54:08.612 --> 54:10.204
Colombia.

54:10.447 --> 54:12.074
Your destination?

54:12.349 --> 54:13.816
New York.

54:14.718 --> 54:16.413
Are these all your bags?

54:16.653 --> 54:17.745
Yes.

54:19.723 --> 54:21.281
Come with me, please.

54:31.434 --> 54:33.834
Put your hands against the wall please.

54:35.972 --> 54:38.065
Not so close to the wall.

54:38.141 --> 54:39.938
Spread your legs, please.

54:49.052 --> 54:50.542
Maria Alvarez.

54:50.787 --> 54:52.778
- Is that your name?
- Yes.

54:53.323 --> 54:55.757
Is this your first time in this country?

54:55.825 --> 54:56.849
Yes.

54:58.328 --> 55:00.091
Where are you staying?

55:02.465 --> 55:03.557
With my sister.

55:03.800 --> 55:07.793
If we called her, would she confirm
you're coming?

55:10.407 --> 55:13.035
I haven't seen her in four years.

55:13.109 --> 55:14.633
I was planning to surprise her.

55:15.278 --> 55:17.269
And you're going to show up just like that?

55:17.347 --> 55:18.939
What if she's not there?

55:20.016 --> 55:22.007
And if you get there and she's not home?

55:22.085 --> 55:23.677
Where will you go?

55:24.921 --> 55:26.286
I don't know.

55:27.424 --> 55:28.584
In a hotel.

55:29.893 --> 55:31.417
Did you buy this ticket?

55:32.262 --> 55:33.286
Yes.

55:33.463 --> 55:34.691
How much did it cost?

55:37.367 --> 55:38.959
Like $500.

55:39.502 --> 55:40.662
Maria.

55:43.073 --> 55:44.836
What do you do in Colombia?

55:45.642 --> 55:47.234
I work with flowers.

55:47.677 --> 55:49.872
What do you do exactly?

55:49.946 --> 55:51.573
I de-thorn them.

55:51.881 --> 55:54.543
How did you get the money for the ticket...

55:54.617 --> 55:56.244
and the $800 that you have on you?

55:57.520 --> 55:58.885
I saved up.

56:02.826 --> 56:04.157
You know what?

56:05.595 --> 56:07.620
I don't believe you're here on vacation.

56:08.598 --> 56:10.862
Why are you really here?

56:12.402 --> 56:13.869
You want to know what I think?

56:15.004 --> 56:16.767
I think you're bringing drugs...

56:16.840 --> 56:17.829
into the United States.

56:18.675 --> 56:21.576
We've known people who swallow drugs...

56:21.644 --> 56:23.942
and bring them in like that.

56:25.181 --> 56:27.206
Do you have drugs in your stomach?

56:29.352 --> 56:30.376
No.

56:35.959 --> 56:37.722
I want you to prove it.

56:37.794 --> 56:41.355
We would like to submit you to an X-ray.

56:44.033 --> 56:45.057
Please...

56:45.135 --> 56:50.004
sign this document authorizing us
to do the X-ray.

57:58.541 --> 57:59.701
Maria...

58:00.944 --> 58:02.878
you know you're pregnant?

58:05.615 --> 58:06.639
Yes.

58:09.853 --> 58:12.048
Will the X-rays hurt my baby?

58:12.355 --> 58:15.017
We don't X-ray pregnant women.

58:15.225 --> 58:16.886
But we can detain them.

58:23.933 --> 58:26.265
We know you didn't buy this ticket.

58:26.503 --> 58:28.835
We know you couldn't have saved
that much money.

58:29.105 --> 58:30.800
Tell us the truth.

58:31.207 --> 58:32.606
Who paid for this ticket?

58:35.512 --> 58:38.345
A friend bought it for me.

58:39.949 --> 58:41.177
What's his name?

58:44.721 --> 58:45.745
Franklin.

58:47.757 --> 58:48.746
He's my boyfriend.

58:49.826 --> 58:51.589
He's the baby's father.

58:52.395 --> 58:54.386
Does he know you swallowed drugs?

58:56.299 --> 58:58.062
I didn't swallow drugs.

58:59.602 --> 59:01.263
I'm not carrying anything.

59:01.905 --> 59:04.271
I just want to visit my sister. That's it.

59:09.913 --> 59:11.278
I swear.

59:26.162 --> 59:27.356
Girl.

59:31.134 --> 59:33.261
- And the other one?
- They caught her.

59:33.336 --> 59:34.633
Fuck!

59:41.077 --> 59:44.740
Make yourself comfortable.
We'll be here until you shit everything out.

59:49.285 --> 59:50.445
She needs a doctor.

59:50.720 --> 59:52.153
Like I care?

59:52.355 --> 59:53.720
She needs medicine.

59:53.790 --> 59:54.814
Shut up!

59:56.726 --> 59:57.954
Take those.

01:00:00.096 --> 01:00:03.065
- What are they?
- Laxatives. They'll make you shit faster.

01:00:03.333 --> 01:00:04.630
I have to go to the bathroom.

01:00:04.801 --> 01:00:05.859
Hold on.

01:00:08.338 --> 01:00:10.829
Don't use the toilet.
I don't want stuff down the drain.

01:00:10.907 --> 01:00:14.274
And don't forget the toothpaste.
I don't want to be smelling your shit.

01:01:05.528 --> 01:01:06.790
How are you?

01:01:08.197 --> 01:01:09.596
Okay.

01:01:10.867 --> 01:01:11.925
And you?

01:02:01.784 --> 01:02:02.944
Lucy.

01:03:25.868 --> 01:03:28.132
- What are you doing?
- Blanca, we can't stay here.

01:03:28.204 --> 01:03:29.432
What do you mean?

01:03:29.505 --> 01:03:31.029
Don't you get it, Blanca?

01:03:31.107 --> 01:03:33.974
They did something to Lucy.
Everything's totally fucked up.

01:03:34.043 --> 01:03:35.738
We have to go before they come back.

01:03:35.878 --> 01:03:37.937
- Maria!
- Hurry up, Blanca!

01:03:53.362 --> 01:03:54.920
What are we going to do?

01:03:56.098 --> 01:03:58.464
I don't know. Let me think for a minute.

01:04:04.607 --> 01:04:05.835
Excuse me.

01:04:05.908 --> 01:04:07.808
Do you know how I can make a call?

01:04:08.311 --> 01:04:09.403
What?

01:04:09.912 --> 01:04:12.244
I need to call this number.

01:04:12.415 --> 01:04:14.007
Me no speak Spanish.

01:04:14.517 --> 01:04:15.950
<i>No español.</i>

01:04:16.018 --> 01:04:17.007
Get it?

01:04:24.126 --> 01:04:25.320
Please.

01:04:25.394 --> 01:04:26.691
Queens, New York.

01:04:27.330 --> 01:04:28.592
You gotta go into New York.

01:04:29.031 --> 01:04:30.726
You gotta take a bus.

01:04:31.167 --> 01:04:32.725
A bus. You know?

01:04:35.404 --> 01:04:37.599
You trying to get to New York?

01:04:38.841 --> 01:04:40.103
To Queens?

01:04:41.544 --> 01:04:42.568
Queens?

01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:45.411
Queens, yes.

01:04:45.481 --> 01:04:46.641
I take you.

01:04:46.749 --> 01:04:47.807
Taxi.

01:04:48.851 --> 01:04:50.751
Thank you, but I just want to call.

01:04:51.053 --> 01:04:52.350
It's okay, no problem.

01:04:53.689 --> 01:04:56.089
I'll take you. Flat rate. Off the meter.

01:06:01.924 --> 01:06:03.721
Can you wait for a minute?

01:06:05.161 --> 01:06:06.651
One moment.

01:06:14.403 --> 01:06:15.631
There's no answer.

01:06:18.407 --> 01:06:20.204
We have to go back.

01:06:20.343 --> 01:06:21.503
No, Blanca.

01:06:21.777 --> 01:06:25.543
Lucy's sister doesn't even know you.
And you don't really know Lucy.

01:06:25.681 --> 01:06:26.807
What are you going to say?

01:06:26.882 --> 01:06:28.281
I don't know, I'll figure it out.

01:06:28.351 --> 01:06:32.185
All we have to do is return the pellets
and get our money.

01:06:32.254 --> 01:06:34.984
Don't you get it? We can't go back there.

01:06:35.057 --> 01:06:38.288
They're gonna be furious
when they find out we're gone.

01:06:38.361 --> 01:06:39.623
We have to go back.

01:06:39.729 --> 01:06:42.061
Did you see what they did to Lucy?

01:07:12.161 --> 01:07:13.253
Blanca, come on.

01:07:13.329 --> 01:07:14.887
I'm not going in.

01:07:15.131 --> 01:07:16.120
Come on!

01:07:16.232 --> 01:07:17.563
I don't want to go in there.

01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:18.926
Come on already!

01:08:59.969 --> 01:09:01.095
Who is it?

01:09:01.370 --> 01:09:02.564
Hello.

01:09:03.171 --> 01:09:06.107
I'm looking for Mrs. Carla Aristizabal.

01:09:10.578 --> 01:09:11.978
Who's looking for her?

01:09:12.081 --> 01:09:13.742
Maria Alvarez.

01:09:14.416 --> 01:09:16.542
I'm a friend of her sister's.

01:09:16.652 --> 01:09:18.381
Of her sister's?

01:09:20.256 --> 01:09:21.484
Honey.

01:09:21.823 --> 01:09:23.654
She says she's a friend of your sister's.

01:09:24.225 --> 01:09:25.658
I don't know. Come.

01:09:32.167 --> 01:09:33.328
Hello.

01:09:33.736 --> 01:09:35.670
Are you Carla Aristizabal?

01:09:36.272 --> 01:09:37.899
How can I help you?

01:09:38.506 --> 01:09:39.667
I'm a friend of Lucy's.

01:09:40.408 --> 01:09:42.639
I just arrived from Colombia...

01:09:42.778 --> 01:09:45.212
and she asked me to stop by
and say hello for her.

01:09:46.749 --> 01:09:48.046
You're a friend of hers?

01:09:48.317 --> 01:09:49.305
Yes.

01:09:50.653 --> 01:09:52.314
Please, come inside.

01:09:58.327 --> 01:10:00.420
Take a seat.

01:10:01.030 --> 01:10:03.521
Sorry, what was your name?

01:10:04.934 --> 01:10:06.424
Maria Alvarez.

01:10:08.103 --> 01:10:09.661
And how do you know Lucy?

01:10:10.206 --> 01:10:12.071
We live in the same town.

01:10:12.141 --> 01:10:13.540
We're neighbors.

01:10:13.909 --> 01:10:17.436
So tell me, how is she doing?
It's been months since we last spoke.

01:10:19.448 --> 01:10:20.779
She's doing well.

01:10:21.116 --> 01:10:22.879
Is she working?

01:10:23.385 --> 01:10:24.613
Yes.

01:10:26.555 --> 01:10:28.022
In an office in Bogota.

01:10:28.524 --> 01:10:29.889
She's a secretary.

01:10:30.125 --> 01:10:31.990
Lucy? A secretary?

01:10:32.795 --> 01:10:34.786
And you're always talking bad about her.

01:10:37.366 --> 01:10:40.426
She's always talking about the two of you.

01:10:40.502 --> 01:10:42.026
She wants to come and visit.

01:10:42.104 --> 01:10:43.230
Really?

01:10:43.539 --> 01:10:47.270
And she didn't send anything with you?
A letter, a photo or something?

01:10:48.477 --> 01:10:49.466
Actually...

01:10:49.912 --> 01:10:51.641
the truth is...

01:10:54.750 --> 01:10:57.344
Lucy gave me your name and address...

01:10:58.754 --> 01:11:01.655
and she said that you're really nice,
and that...

01:11:03.092 --> 01:11:05.652
if I had any trouble I could come...

01:11:05.728 --> 01:11:07.195
and talk to you.

01:11:10.165 --> 01:11:12.292
I don't have a place to stay.

01:11:14.436 --> 01:11:17.098
How long have you been here?

01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:19.569
Two days.

01:11:20.676 --> 01:11:22.439
Where were you staying these two days?

01:11:23.612 --> 01:11:26.604
Well... I was staying with a friend...

01:11:27.149 --> 01:11:29.242
but we got into a fight and...

01:11:30.452 --> 01:11:31.919
she kicked me out.

01:11:33.055 --> 01:11:35.080
And you don't have anyone else here?

01:11:35.257 --> 01:11:37.384
Family, friends? Nobody?

01:11:38.193 --> 01:11:39.217
No, ma'am.

01:11:40.162 --> 01:11:41.925
Do you have a job yet?

01:11:43.832 --> 01:11:45.493
No, not yet.

01:11:46.068 --> 01:11:47.933
And how did you say you knew Lucy?

01:11:48.003 --> 01:11:49.027
Carla.

01:11:49.104 --> 01:11:51.595
It's not like I'm gonna throw her out
on the street.

01:11:51.674 --> 01:11:54.575
It's just that this apartment is very small.

01:11:54.643 --> 01:11:57.976
We sleep in the bedroom,
and Pablo's cousin here in the living room.

01:11:58.047 --> 01:11:59.708
Honestly...

01:11:59.782 --> 01:12:01.613
I don't need a lot of space.

01:12:02.318 --> 01:12:04.149
Yes, but for how long?

01:12:04.420 --> 01:12:06.388
Only for a few days.

01:12:06.789 --> 01:12:07.915
And then what?

01:12:07.990 --> 01:12:11.255
I'll find something. Don't worry.

01:12:22.604 --> 01:12:25.004
My cousin works in a bakery.

01:12:25.507 --> 01:12:29.341
He gets home in the middle of the night,
so don't get scared.

01:13:05.114 --> 01:13:06.604
For Colombia?

01:13:29.938 --> 01:13:31.132
Lucy's not there.

01:13:34.810 --> 01:13:35.936
Carla.

01:13:38.447 --> 01:13:41.245
I want to call my mom. Can you help me?

01:13:48.724 --> 01:13:50.351
Dial the number.

01:13:57.232 --> 01:13:58.563
Grandma?

01:13:59.101 --> 01:14:01.262
Hi Grandma. It's Maria.

01:14:02.671 --> 01:14:04.104
Fine, and you?

01:14:07.376 --> 01:14:08.468
Yes, I'm fine.

01:14:08.544 --> 01:14:11.069
I'm still in Chiquinquira...

01:14:11.146 --> 01:14:13.671
but I'll see you in a few days.

01:14:14.183 --> 01:14:16.674
How's everyone else doing?

01:14:17.019 --> 01:14:18.281
Diana?

01:14:19.421 --> 01:14:22.549
No, Grandma, I was just calling to say hi.

01:14:22.624 --> 01:14:26.287
I promised Mom I would call.

01:14:26.361 --> 01:14:27.350
Yes.

01:14:40.342 --> 01:14:41.707
Oh, the car.

01:14:41.910 --> 01:14:44.174
I'm a driver for a car service.

01:14:46.448 --> 01:14:47.437
Get in.

01:15:09.104 --> 01:15:10.071
Hi.

01:15:11.507 --> 01:15:13.338
What happened? Where did you go?

01:15:13.408 --> 01:15:15.342
I met a woman who gave me a place...

01:15:15.410 --> 01:15:16.672
You know each other?

01:15:18.413 --> 01:15:19.971
Is that Lucy's sister?

01:15:20.482 --> 01:15:21.915
You know Lucy?

01:15:24.486 --> 01:15:25.510
Yes.

01:15:25.754 --> 01:15:26.778
What do you mean?

01:15:26.855 --> 01:15:28.686
You said you didn't know anyone else here.

01:15:32.261 --> 01:15:35.924
The thing is... I told her about Lucy
on the way here.

01:15:35.998 --> 01:15:37.090
So...

01:15:37.232 --> 01:15:38.824
you're not really a friend of hers.

01:15:39.835 --> 01:15:43.703
It's just that Maria said that she was going
to stay with you and...

01:15:43.772 --> 01:15:45.069
I don't have a place to stay.

01:15:45.707 --> 01:15:47.231
You, too?

01:15:47.643 --> 01:15:49.508
I don't understand.

01:15:50.045 --> 01:15:52.206
Everyone knows someone here.

01:16:04.726 --> 01:16:08.093
Yes, yes. I'll get the receipt.

01:16:08.163 --> 01:16:10.961
I'll come up with something. Don't worry.

01:16:11.700 --> 01:16:15.227
Tell them to fix this, and
not to charge you...

01:16:15.737 --> 01:16:18.365
since they did it wrong the first time.

01:16:19.274 --> 01:16:20.798
- How are you?
- Fine.

01:16:20.976 --> 01:16:22.136
How's the little one?

01:16:22.578 --> 01:16:24.443
Fine, thank you, Don Fernando.

01:16:24.513 --> 01:16:27.573
It seems my sister in Colombia sent me
a little surprise.

01:16:27.649 --> 01:16:28.673
Maria and Blanca.

01:16:28.817 --> 01:16:29.909
Hi.

01:16:29.985 --> 01:16:31.316
When did they arrive?

01:16:31.386 --> 01:16:33.820
They just got here,
but they don't know anyone.

01:16:33.889 --> 01:16:37.120
Maybe you know of an apartment...

01:16:37.192 --> 01:16:38.784
a job or something.

01:16:38.860 --> 01:16:42.728
Don't you worry. I'll make a couple calls
and we'Il...

01:16:43.865 --> 01:16:44.889
Yes, sure...

01:16:45.133 --> 01:16:47.795
He'll help you. I've got to go to work.

01:16:47.903 --> 01:16:49.564
You know how to get back.

01:16:49.638 --> 01:16:51.765
Three blocks down and around the corner.

01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:53.398
I'll be back tonight to let you in.

01:16:53.475 --> 01:16:54.442
Thanks.

01:16:54.509 --> 01:16:56.067
I'm leaving them here. Bye.

01:16:59.181 --> 01:17:03.049
There's a place that usually needs
women to sew.

01:17:03.151 --> 01:17:05.551
They don't check papers...

01:17:05.621 --> 01:17:06.883
and they pay minimum wage.

01:17:06.955 --> 01:17:09.947
Thanks for your help,
but we don't need work.

01:17:12.027 --> 01:17:13.892
What are you doing? We can't go back there.

01:17:13.962 --> 01:17:16.658
I don't care what you do.
I'm sick of following you around.

01:17:16.732 --> 01:17:18.893
Like I asked you to? I told you not to come.

01:17:18.967 --> 01:17:21.765
You're the one that wanted to take off
before we got paid.

01:17:21.837 --> 01:17:23.031
Those guys are dangerous.

01:17:23.105 --> 01:17:24.094
Quiet.

01:17:24.172 --> 01:17:26.402
What's that you've got there?

01:17:26.475 --> 01:17:27.499
Nothing.

01:17:27.576 --> 01:17:28.736
I recognize what those are.

01:17:28.810 --> 01:17:30.209
I've seen that before.

01:17:30.646 --> 01:17:31.772
Tell me.

01:17:33.382 --> 01:17:35.077
Does Carla know about this?

01:17:35.550 --> 01:17:37.313
Are you all right, physically?

01:17:41.823 --> 01:17:44.621
Our friend who was with us got sick.

01:17:46.161 --> 01:17:48.629
I think one of the pellets broke inside her.

01:17:49.665 --> 01:17:52.065
I don't know if they killed
her or if she died.

01:17:54.269 --> 01:17:55.793
I don't know what to do.

01:17:57.572 --> 01:17:59.233
Where was this?

01:18:03.178 --> 01:18:06.079
Don Fernando,
please help us find our friend.

01:18:07.516 --> 01:18:11.748
I'll make some calls to the police
in New Jersey.

01:18:12.087 --> 01:18:14.078
They might know something.

01:18:14.156 --> 01:18:15.714
You can't call the police.

01:18:15.791 --> 01:18:17.486
Don't worry. I know what I'm doing.

01:18:18.093 --> 01:18:20.357
You have to return those drugs.

01:18:20.429 --> 01:18:23.523
Before they hurt your families in Colombia.

01:18:23.965 --> 01:18:25.193
Do you understand?

01:18:33.608 --> 01:18:34.597
Blanca.

01:18:34.810 --> 01:18:37.472
I lost the emergency number.
Do you have it?

01:18:37.546 --> 01:18:40.447
I can't believe what you told him
about Lucy.

01:18:40.515 --> 01:18:42.278
He's calling the cops now.

01:18:42.350 --> 01:18:45.342
Don't fucking start with me.

01:18:45.420 --> 01:18:48.947
You were the one pulling out the pellets
and running your mouth.

01:18:49.057 --> 01:18:50.285
You want to sew shirts?

01:18:50.358 --> 01:18:52.622
- I'm handling this.
- Stupidly.

01:18:52.694 --> 01:18:56.460
Then why are you following me around?
Every time I turn around, there you are.

01:18:56.531 --> 01:18:59.227
I thought you knew what you were doing,
but obviously not.

01:18:59.301 --> 01:19:01.792
I'm not responsible for you.
I'm not your fucking mother.

01:19:01.870 --> 01:19:06.102
I wouldn't want you anyway. I feel sorry for
your baby having such a stupid mother.

01:19:06.174 --> 01:19:07.402
How fucking stupid...

01:19:07.476 --> 01:19:09.103
swallowing drugs when you're pregnant.

01:19:09.177 --> 01:19:10.201
Fuck you.

01:20:35.096 --> 01:20:37.860
- Do you have an appointment?
- No.

01:20:40.368 --> 01:20:42.836
I can give you one for next week.

01:20:42.904 --> 01:20:44.428
No, it has to be today.

01:20:50.512 --> 01:20:53.208
If you don't mind waiting,
I might get you in...

01:20:53.281 --> 01:20:55.044
but I can't promise.

01:20:55.684 --> 01:20:56.673
Thanks.

01:20:57.319 --> 01:20:59.378
Fill this out.

01:21:07.929 --> 01:21:11.023
You have to be very careful
while you're pregnant.

01:21:11.266 --> 01:21:12.563
You can't smoke.

01:21:12.801 --> 01:21:14.200
You can't drink alcohol.

01:21:14.436 --> 01:21:16.199
No beer, no wine.

01:21:16.371 --> 01:21:17.429
Especially not drugs.

01:21:17.973 --> 01:21:21.101
Everything you put in your body
goes straight to the baby.

01:21:21.176 --> 01:21:24.407
If you smoke,
it's like giving a cigarette to your baby.

01:21:24.813 --> 01:21:25.837
Okay?

01:21:27.048 --> 01:21:28.345
Let's see.

01:21:37.492 --> 01:21:41.223
At this stage of the pregnancy
we can see the entire fetus.

01:21:43.498 --> 01:21:44.931
That's the head.

01:21:47.402 --> 01:21:48.426
See?

01:21:50.338 --> 01:21:51.930
That's my baby?

01:21:52.107 --> 01:21:53.768
The arms.

01:21:55.944 --> 01:21:57.912
These are the legs.

01:22:03.351 --> 01:22:04.613
The blood is flowing well.

01:22:05.420 --> 01:22:06.717
I'll take some measurements.

01:22:10.125 --> 01:22:11.592
But everything's okay, right?

01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:13.952
Yes, everything is okay.

01:22:16.364 --> 01:22:17.592
Do you want to listen...

01:22:18.233 --> 01:22:19.325
to the heart?

01:22:45.961 --> 01:22:48.589
Friday, the eleventh of next month.

01:22:56.638 --> 01:22:57.969
That's fine.

01:23:16.691 --> 01:23:19.091
They found the body of a woman yesterday.

01:23:20.161 --> 01:23:23.062
The stomach had been cut open...

01:23:23.431 --> 01:23:25.626
and they think it was a mule.

01:23:27.235 --> 01:23:29.362
They sent this information...

01:23:31.740 --> 01:23:33.537
with a picture of her face.

01:23:42.250 --> 01:23:43.581
I'm sorry.

01:23:46.154 --> 01:23:47.314
Please...

01:23:47.389 --> 01:23:49.914
I need to know your friend's name.

01:23:50.725 --> 01:23:52.852
And an address in Colombia.

01:23:55.063 --> 01:23:57.156
What's her name?

01:24:05.173 --> 01:24:06.504
Lucy Diaz.

01:24:07.542 --> 01:24:09.203
Carla's sister?

01:24:09.577 --> 01:24:10.839
Yes. But Carla doesn't know.

01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:14.141
She was coming to visit.

01:24:14.916 --> 01:24:16.941
She has to know.

01:24:17.652 --> 01:24:19.142
It's her sister.

01:24:24.225 --> 01:24:27.558
I'm sure the baby will sleep with us
in the beginning but...

01:24:27.629 --> 01:24:28.994
the crib was on sale.

01:24:30.365 --> 01:24:31.923
What did Don Fernando tell you?

01:24:41.109 --> 01:24:42.542
He told me that...

01:24:53.922 --> 01:24:55.287
Carla.

01:24:56.191 --> 01:24:59.126
I don't really need a job.

01:25:01.296 --> 01:25:03.025
I'm going back to Colombia.

01:25:06.801 --> 01:25:08.860
Darling, you're not going back.

01:25:09.404 --> 01:25:10.996
I know how you feel.

01:25:11.072 --> 01:25:14.007
I felt the same way when I came here.

01:25:14.909 --> 01:25:18.777
I remember on my grandma's birthday,
I called home...

01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:21.441
and I could hear my whole family...

01:25:21.516 --> 01:25:25.213
laughing and screaming.

01:25:26.254 --> 01:25:30.054
My little sister asking, "How is it
over there? Is it wonderful?

01:25:30.125 --> 01:25:31.615
"How's your job?"

01:25:32.093 --> 01:25:35.551
Telling me how much she wanted to come
and stay with me.

01:25:36.131 --> 01:25:40.625
I just wanted to tell them
how much I missed them.

01:25:41.636 --> 01:25:44.127
But it gets better, trust me.

01:25:45.106 --> 01:25:47.836
I remember when I got my first paycheck.

01:25:48.643 --> 01:25:53.580
I'll never forget going to that office
to send money home for the first time.

01:25:55.216 --> 01:25:58.310
You can't imagine how it feels.

01:25:59.988 --> 01:26:03.446
Your heart feels so big...

01:26:03.525 --> 01:26:06.187
like it won't fit in your chest.

01:26:08.796 --> 01:26:12.061
The real reason I stay here is for my baby.

01:26:13.234 --> 01:26:16.067
He'll have so many more opportunities.

01:26:18.039 --> 01:26:20.803
I can't imagine bringing up my child
in Colombia.

01:26:20.875 --> 01:26:22.433
Not with the situation being what it is.

01:26:24.279 --> 01:26:27.112
It pains me to say it, but it's true.

01:26:34.422 --> 01:26:36.982
- I'll get it.
- That must be your friend.

01:26:53.241 --> 01:26:55.232
They found Lucy's body.

01:26:55.643 --> 01:26:57.543
I saw it in a picture.

01:27:03.651 --> 01:27:07.781
It'll cost $2,500 to send
her body back home.

01:27:14.963 --> 01:27:16.089
Pablo.

01:27:17.599 --> 01:27:18.964
Are you done?

01:27:19.534 --> 01:27:20.865
Yes, love.

01:27:28.643 --> 01:27:29.667
Hello.

01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:33.508
It's for you, Carla.

01:27:33.748 --> 01:27:36.410
How are you, Don Fernando?

01:27:38.586 --> 01:27:40.577
I'm fine, thank you. Why do you ask?

01:27:43.491 --> 01:27:45.015
Arrangements?

01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:47.357
Arrangements for what?

01:27:49.664 --> 01:27:50.653
No.

01:27:52.300 --> 01:27:54.097
She didn't say anything.

01:27:58.306 --> 01:27:59.568
Lucy?

01:28:01.309 --> 01:28:02.674
What do you mean?

01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:06.942
Are you sure?

01:28:08.850 --> 01:28:10.317
Found here?

01:28:11.252 --> 01:28:13.379
I don't understand. What do you mean?

01:28:15.423 --> 01:28:17.891
- They came as what?
- Carla, please, let me explain.

01:28:17.959 --> 01:28:21.759
I tried to tell you,
but I couldn't get the words out.

01:28:21.896 --> 01:28:23.090
What are you saying?

01:28:23.264 --> 01:28:24.856
Lucy got sick.

01:28:25.099 --> 01:28:27.761
I tried to help her. I swear.

01:28:27.835 --> 01:28:28.859
But I didn't know what...

01:28:28.936 --> 01:28:30.426
When were you going to tell me?

01:28:30.705 --> 01:28:32.400
I talked to Don Fernando.

01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:36.139
I arranged everything
to send Lucy back to Colombia.

01:28:36.210 --> 01:28:37.268
Arranged?

01:28:37.378 --> 01:28:38.402
Carla, please.

01:28:38.479 --> 01:28:41.004
Arranged what?
You're not arranging anything.

01:28:41.082 --> 01:28:43.550
- You keep your hands off my sister.
- What's going on?

01:28:43.618 --> 01:28:45.085
You've done enough!

01:28:45.153 --> 01:28:46.450
No, you don't understand.

01:28:46.521 --> 01:28:47.510
What have you done?

01:28:47.588 --> 01:28:49.886
Fucking little bitches.

01:28:49.957 --> 01:28:51.754
Carla, listen to me. Please.

01:28:51.826 --> 01:28:54.056
You were never her friend. Never!

01:28:54.128 --> 01:28:57.063
- Don't say that. I tried to help her.
- Get out now!

01:28:57.131 --> 01:28:59.622
I tried to help her. I swear.

01:28:59.701 --> 01:29:00.668
Get out!

01:29:00.735 --> 01:29:02.430
- Maria, let's go.
- Just go, please.

01:29:02.503 --> 01:29:04.403
- Get them out already!
- Forgive me.

01:29:04.472 --> 01:29:05.461
Get out!

01:29:05.540 --> 01:29:06.564
Please leave.

01:29:06.641 --> 01:29:08.040
Get out! Get out!

01:29:32.734 --> 01:29:34.065
What do you want to do?

01:29:54.122 --> 01:29:55.146
It's ringing.

01:29:57.725 --> 01:29:58.817
Hello.

01:29:59.093 --> 01:30:00.958
This is Maria Alvarez.

01:30:02.330 --> 01:30:03.854
Yes, she's with me.

01:30:03.998 --> 01:30:06.728
Where the fuck did you think you
were going with the stash?

01:30:06.801 --> 01:30:07.790
- Bitches!
- But, we...

01:30:07.869 --> 01:30:10.565
But nothing! Where are the fucking pellets?

01:30:10.638 --> 01:30:12.196
Come on!

01:30:12.273 --> 01:30:13.331
Let her go.

01:30:13.408 --> 01:30:16.002
- What about yours?
- In my purse.

01:30:16.077 --> 01:30:19.342
She should have 50
and the other one 62.

01:30:28.756 --> 01:30:30.690
They're all here.

01:30:31.025 --> 01:30:32.583
All right, it's all good.

01:30:32.794 --> 01:30:34.386
What about our money?

01:30:34.462 --> 01:30:38.262
You think we owe you? After you went
running from the hotel?

01:30:38.499 --> 01:30:40.091
But we called you.

01:30:41.536 --> 01:30:44.027
You got lucky.

01:30:44.105 --> 01:30:47.871
I was about to tell Javier
that you ran off with the goods.

01:30:47.975 --> 01:30:49.704
But you have all the pellets.

01:30:49.777 --> 01:30:53.008
That's right. We have them.
We couldn't give a fuck about you.

01:30:53.080 --> 01:30:55.640
We still need that money.

01:30:55.716 --> 01:30:56.774
Really?

01:30:57.685 --> 01:30:59.710
I see. You need the money?

01:31:01.055 --> 01:31:03.523
You really need the money?

01:31:08.996 --> 01:31:10.020
Know what?

01:31:10.097 --> 01:31:11.189
Give it to them.

01:31:18.105 --> 01:31:19.197
Take it.

01:31:20.508 --> 01:31:21.634
Come on.

01:31:22.510 --> 01:31:23.602
Here.

01:31:31.452 --> 01:31:33.113
Make sure it's all there.

01:31:34.355 --> 01:31:39.349
When you get back to Colombia,
be sure to tell Javier how nice I was.

01:31:40.161 --> 01:31:42.994
You better not fuck around
on your next trip.

01:31:43.097 --> 01:31:44.121
Got it?

01:31:44.532 --> 01:31:46.864
You've been trained now.

01:31:49.937 --> 01:31:51.336
What about Lucy's money?

01:31:52.306 --> 01:31:54.206
What about it?

01:31:54.542 --> 01:31:58.137
- I want to give it to her family.
- You've got nothing to do with that.

01:31:58.212 --> 01:32:00.043
You have her pellets.

01:32:00.114 --> 01:32:01.809
That's none of your business.

01:32:01.883 --> 01:32:03.851
She died doing this.

01:32:03.918 --> 01:32:05.749
They found her body.

01:32:06.020 --> 01:32:09.114
I just want to give her sister the money.

01:32:09.223 --> 01:32:10.383
No fucking way.

01:32:10.458 --> 01:32:12.153
She deserves a proper burial.

01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:14.960
After what you did to her...

01:32:15.029 --> 01:32:16.496
it's your responsibility.

01:32:16.564 --> 01:32:18.259
Fuck that. She knew what she was doing.

01:32:18.332 --> 01:32:20.857
It's not on us.

01:32:20.935 --> 01:32:24.427
- Of course...
- Shut the fuck up, bitch! Get out. Now!

01:32:47.028 --> 01:32:52.022
And this is so Carla can send Lucy
back to Colombia.

01:32:52.099 --> 01:32:53.157
Okay.

01:32:53.234 --> 01:32:54.326
If that's what she wants.

01:33:00.474 --> 01:33:01.668
One minute, please.

01:33:03.110 --> 01:33:06.443
I'll be back in a minute. Excuse me.

01:33:56.197 --> 01:33:57.255
I'm sorry.

01:33:57.331 --> 01:33:59.299
I didn't mean to disturb you.

01:34:00.468 --> 01:34:02.561
I'm going back to Colombia.

01:34:04.138 --> 01:34:07.938
I just wanted to say goodbye to Lucy.

01:34:17.985 --> 01:34:19.475
She looks pretty.

01:34:32.299 --> 01:34:34.824
I don't understand why she never
said anything.

01:34:36.737 --> 01:34:38.637
We grew so far apart.

01:35:51.645 --> 01:35:52.703
Blanca.

01:36:01.645 --> 01:36:32.703
