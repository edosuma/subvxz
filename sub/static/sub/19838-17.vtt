00:01.790 --> 00:06.410
<b>Would you allow us to have names?</b>

00:06.410 --> 00:07.980
<b>What is a name?</b>

00:08.240 --> 00:12.990
<b>It's like a code that can be 
used to identify each of us.</b>

00:14.730 --> 00:18.490
<b><i>Names... Quite amusing.</i></b>

00:20.470 --> 00:23.000
<b><i>The King's three Royal Guards.</i></b>

00:23.000 --> 00:26.370
<b><i>I shall name you myself.</i></b>

01:55.940 --> 01:58.450
<b>Seeking the giant Chimera Ant,</b>

01:57.540 --> 02:01.030
<b>Mitene Union:

Republic of Rokario 
Hass Republic 
Republic of West Gorteau 
Republic of East Gorteau</b>

01:58.450 --> 02:01.560
<b>Kite's group has arrived in the Mitene Union.</b>

02:01.030 --> 02:07.960
<b>NGL Autonomous Region        Republic of Rokario</b>

02:02.050 --> 02:04.790
<b>Now, they travel from the Republic of Rokario</b>

02:04.790 --> 02:07.560
<b>to the neighboring NGL Autonomous Region.</b>

02:10.820 --> 02:13.040
<b>NGL, huh?</b>

02:13.040 --> 02:17.440
<b>They believe living naturally is always better.</b>

02:17.860 --> 02:20.620
<b>They may be weird for living there,</b>

02:20.620 --> 02:23.580
<b>but you guys are weird for coming to visit, too.</b>

02:24.240 --> 02:26.410
<b>No idea what's going on,</b>

02:26.920 --> 02:31.580
<b>but I've already driven in about 
ten similar groups today alone.</b>

02:31.870 --> 02:33.050
<b>Ten groups?!</b>

02:33.550 --> 02:34.490
<b>Yeah.</b>

02:36.310 --> 02:40.380
<b>Then it sounds like we're 
among the last to arrive.</b>

02:43.940 --> 02:46.600
<b>They're probably other pro Hunter teams.</b>

02:46.910 --> 02:49.230
<b>All looking for the giant insects?</b>

02:49.520 --> 02:52.870
<b>Yeah, those veterans are good.</b>

02:52.870 --> 02:55.610
<b>Somehow, they've managed 
to obtain this information.</b>

02:56.130 --> 02:58.610
<b>But are there really bugs</b>

02:58.610 --> 03:01.880
<b>large enough to attack humans?</b>

03:02.870 --> 03:05.110
<b>It defies common sense,</b>

03:05.630 --> 03:09.750
<b>but that voice they heard over the transmitter...</b>

03:10.170 --> 03:11.970
<b><i>M-Monsters...</i></b>

03:11.970 --> 03:13.720
<b><i>Giant bugs!</i></b>

03:16.480 --> 03:19.010
<b>It could be some other kind of organism.</b>

03:20.400 --> 03:23.140
<b>NGL is one big nature reserve,</b>

03:23.140 --> 03:28.240
<b>so it's said to be inhabited by many organisms 
that haven't been reported in academic circles.</b>

03:29.650 --> 03:33.320
<b>It wouldn't be strange if there are 
insects that attack humans.</b>

03:34.700 --> 03:37.350
<b>Even if there aren't any giant bugs,</b>

03:37.350 --> 03:42.030
<b>this trip will be worth it if we can confirm the 
existence of any unidentified organisms.</b>

03:43.120 --> 03:48.410
<b>As a new Magical Beast Hunter, 
I need to produce results.</b>

03:49.180 --> 03:52.580
<b>Now that I'm here, I have 
to accomplish something.</b>

04:08.480 --> 04:12.430
<b>According to the scouts that 
went out first thing this morning,</b>

04:13.040 --> 04:16.100
<b>a new human village has been discovered</b>

04:16.100 --> 04:19.320
<b>in sector MA18, in the southwest.</b>

04:19.870 --> 04:21.340
<b>There are twelve houses,</b>

04:21.340 --> 04:25.320
<b>with anywhere from twenty to sixty residents.</b>

04:25.680 --> 04:28.580
<b>Hey, that's pretty big.</b>

04:28.930 --> 04:31.530
<b>Guess there are still a few large villages left.</b>

04:31.530 --> 04:35.060
<b>I thought we'd already cleaned out that area.</b>

04:35.720 --> 04:40.190
<b>Then I will add this village to our 
list of targets for the day.</b>

04:40.590 --> 04:42.780
<b>Colt, could you make the trip?</b>

04:42.780 --> 04:43.760
<b>Roger.</b>

04:44.090 --> 04:45.510
<b>What's this, Peggy?</b>

04:45.510 --> 04:47.300
<b>You aren't sending me?</b>

04:47.300 --> 04:52.000
<b>Cheetu, I need you to go northwest, 
as originally planned.</b>

04:52.520 --> 04:53.980
<b>Zazan, you accompany him.</b>

04:54.480 --> 04:58.360
<b>There aren't any large villages 
left in the northwest.</b>

04:58.640 --> 05:02.730
<b>Even if there were, there probably 
aren't any strong, young humans.</b>

05:02.730 --> 05:06.110
<b>It's more fun when I get to chase them around.</b>

05:06.110 --> 05:07.110
<b>Cheetu!</b>

05:07.460 --> 05:09.210
<b>We do not hunt for amusement.</b>

05:09.510 --> 05:11.060
<b>We serve the Queen.</b>

05:11.890 --> 05:16.250
<b>We need only capture the 
requested number of humans.</b>

05:16.560 --> 05:18.350
<b>I know that, Colt.</b>

05:18.350 --> 05:20.220
<b>We'll get the job done.</b>

05:20.490 --> 05:21.630
<b>Right, Zazan?</b>

05:21.890 --> 05:24.000
<b>I'll fulfill the quota.</b>

05:24.390 --> 05:27.650
<b>But I don't need you telling 
me how to hunt my prey.</b>

05:28.500 --> 05:30.760
<b>I'll do things my own way.</b>

05:31.190 --> 05:35.000
<b>It's fun to hunt humans when 
they're running around.</b>

05:35.000 --> 05:36.140
<b>What did you say?</b>

05:36.700 --> 05:39.110
<b>Well, there you go.</b>

05:39.470 --> 05:41.020
<b>Let's go, Zazan.</b>

05:41.020 --> 05:43.840
<b>Colt, don't get too worked up.</b>

05:43.840 --> 05:46.400
<b>You'll have an easier time</b>

05:46.400 --> 05:48.280
<b>if you learn to relax.</b>

05:49.990 --> 05:51.760
<b>They dare do things their own way?</b>

05:52.160 --> 05:54.790
<b>At this rate, their squadrons will fall apart!</b>

05:55.310 --> 05:57.690
<b>While the use of names</b>

05:57.690 --> 06:00.690
<b>is convenient for leading the troops,</b>

06:00.690 --> 06:04.180
<b>we don't want to encourage too much individuality.</b>

06:04.180 --> 06:07.760
<b>Their behavior could lead to 
a breakdown in command.</b>

06:08.180 --> 06:09.560
<b>We must take steps.</b>

06:09.920 --> 06:12.700
<b>I agree that something must be done.</b>

06:13.460 --> 06:19.280
<b>Meleoron and Yunju have yet to 
show themselves at a war council.</b>

06:19.700 --> 06:20.790
<b>Meleoron!</b>

06:20.790 --> 06:22.550
<b>Stop hiding, and show yourself!</b>

06:28.850 --> 06:30.650
<b>Just to be clear,</b>

06:30.650 --> 06:34.220
<b>it isn't my fault Yunju is absent.</b>

06:34.220 --> 06:36.830
<b>You were hiding because you 
thought you'd be blamed?</b>

06:37.610 --> 06:40.720
<b>You're supposed to be a squadron leader.</b>

06:41.260 --> 06:44.090
<b>Where is Yunju? Why is he not here?</b>

06:44.750 --> 06:47.180
<b>See? I'm the one getting yelled at.</b>

06:47.180 --> 06:49.230
<b>That's why I didn't want to come out.</b>

06:49.230 --> 06:51.340
<b>It's always my fault.</b>

06:51.790 --> 06:54.090
<b>You're just as guilty for hiding the truth.</b>

06:54.090 --> 06:54.840
<b>And further...</b>

06:54.840 --> 06:56.100
<b>I'll talk!</b>

06:56.100 --> 06:59.730
<b>It isn't like I wanted to cover for him or anything.</b>

07:00.110 --> 07:03.860
<b>He's the one who ran off on 
his own to hunt humans.</b>

07:04.270 --> 07:06.290
<b>What? Toward which sector?</b>

07:06.800 --> 07:08.470
<b>Was a new village discovered?</b>

07:08.470 --> 07:10.470
<b>That's not it!</b>

07:10.470 --> 07:13.960
<b>You remember the humans who fought back?</b>

07:13.960 --> 07:16.170
<b>The ones who were armed with guns.</b>

07:16.930 --> 07:18.500
<b>Yunju was</b>

07:18.820 --> 07:22.940
<b>all worked up about making them his pets.</b>

07:42.200 --> 07:44.910
<b>Come on! What are you doing?</b>

07:44.910 --> 07:46.570
<b>I accidentally stepped on you.</b>

07:47.250 --> 07:50.840
<b>You're supposed to entertain us more!</b>

07:50.840 --> 07:52.320
<b>That's right!</b>

07:55.860 --> 07:58.010
<b>Run for your lives!</b>

08:00.570 --> 08:02.330
<b>Until you're dead.</b>

08:06.790 --> 08:09.710
<b>This is the border with NGL.</b>

08:10.040 --> 08:14.610
<b>Those two huge trees serve as 
the checkpoint and embassy.</b>

08:16.890 --> 08:19.900
<b>What's out here, in the middle of nowhere?</b>

08:20.230 --> 08:23.150
<b>These people are all so weird.</b>

08:30.400 --> 08:32.360
<b>Stay alert.</b>

08:32.820 --> 08:37.640
<b>The Ants are a concern, but the NGL is 
more than a nature-loving organization.</b>

08:38.380 --> 08:39.540
<b>Got it.</b>

08:43.210 --> 08:45.370
<b>What brings you here?</b>

08:46.240 --> 08:47.400
<b>We're on a hunt.</b>

08:47.840 --> 08:51.880
<b>A quarantined organism may 
have invaded this country.</b>

08:56.850 --> 08:59.220
<b>If you are pro Hunters,</b>

08:59.220 --> 09:03.310
<b>then we cannot deny you entry.</b>

09:03.910 --> 09:04.870
<b>Follow me.</b>

09:19.550 --> 09:22.060
<b>You're using computers and machines.</b>

09:22.060 --> 09:26.250
<b>This place isn't within NGL's borders.</b>

09:26.700 --> 09:30.840
<b>This area is used for foreign relations 
and information exchange.</b>

09:31.210 --> 09:34.650
<b>Are there any facilities similar 
to this within the country?</b>

09:34.650 --> 09:36.840
<b>No, not a single one.</b>

09:37.340 --> 09:41.400
<b>No machines of any kind are allowed inside NGL.</b>

09:41.400 --> 09:45.850
<b>Naturally, visitors are also not allowed</b>

09:45.850 --> 09:48.410
<b>to bring any inside.</b>

09:48.410 --> 09:52.650
<b>Which means that you'll need 
to remove all metallic,</b>

09:52.650 --> 09:56.860
<b>petroleum, glass, or other 
such goods on your person.</b>

09:57.370 --> 09:59.600
<b>D-Does that include my glasses?</b>

09:59.910 --> 10:00.620
<b>Yes.</b>

10:01.130 --> 10:05.600
<b>If your clothes, belts, shoes, or 
underwear contain any plastic,</b>

10:05.600 --> 10:08.730
<b>chemicals, or metal, you must remove them.</b>

10:09.750 --> 10:11.210
<b>That isn't funny.</b>

10:11.670 --> 10:13.790
<b>You're telling us to strip naked?</b>

10:13.790 --> 10:15.750
<b>Don't worry.</b>

10:15.750 --> 10:19.220
<b>There is natural clothing for sale upstairs.</b>

10:19.730 --> 10:24.280
<b>Also, if there are any bolts inside 
your body, dental implants,</b>

10:25.130 --> 10:29.220
<b>gold, silver, or silicon enhancements</b>

10:29.220 --> 10:34.610
<b>that cannot be removed,

10:37.360 --> 10:39.610
<b>Shop</b>

10:40.910 --> 10:43.190
<b>Only the five of us are left?</b>

10:46.730 --> 10:49.670
<b>I want you to stand by in the closest town.</b>

10:50.210 --> 10:53.270
<b>We'll return here within two 
weeks and contact you.</b>

10:53.720 --> 10:54.720
<b>Got it.</b>

10:56.240 --> 10:58.290
<b>The checkpoint is over there.</b>

11:01.620 --> 11:05.140
<b>There will be a physical exam and interview,</b>

11:05.750 --> 11:08.560
<b>as well as metal, x-ray,</b>

11:08.560 --> 11:12.290
<b>and ultrasound scanning.</b>

11:14.410 --> 11:16.100
<b>The security is rather strict.</b>

11:17.740 --> 11:23.250
<b>Some people have smuggled in guns by 
hiding the parts inside their bodies.</b>

11:24.100 --> 11:27.770
<b>It's common for people to hide cameras 
or cell phones in their rectums.</b>

11:28.400 --> 11:30.890
<b>Some people even trained animals</b>

11:30.890 --> 11:34.260
<b>to bring them laptops once they were inside.</b>

11:38.610 --> 11:40.710
<b>All of you are clean.</b>

11:42.410 --> 11:44.260
<b>Thank you for your patience.</b>

11:44.260 --> 11:46.530
<b>Please pass through.</b>

11:49.310 --> 11:52.470
<b>Welcome to NGL.</b>

12:06.820 --> 12:10.170
<b>Okay, let's begin the hunt.</b>

12:18.110 --> 12:21.340
<b>Horse Rental

<b><i>I haven't heard anything.</i></b>

<b><i>Even if there were any such creatures,</i></b>

12:33.630 --> 12:37.060
<b><i>the citizens in this country wouldn't

12:37.460 --> 12:40.590
<b><i>If we are attacked and killed by animals,</i></b>

12:40.590 --> 12:45.340
<b><i>that is simply nature taking its course.</i></b>

12:52.090 --> 12:57.050
<b>Anyway, we should follow the 
coast and check the villages.</b>

12:57.050 --> 13:00.610
<b>If we go through all of them 
and nothing turns up,</b>

13:00.610 --> 13:03.340
<b>it probably isn't in this country.</b>

13:03.810 --> 13:08.000
<b>That's assuming those guys 
were telling the truth.</b>

13:08.270 --> 13:09.850
<b>They're still following us,</b>

13:10.190 --> 13:11.110
<b>aren't they?</b>

13:11.970 --> 13:12.850
<b>Yeah...</b>

13:13.610 --> 13:15.460
<b>They claim to be here</b>

13:15.460 --> 13:18.860
<b>in case we encounter unknown tribes and 
require interpreters or intermediaries.</b>

13:19.660 --> 13:21.500
<b>But they're obviously here to watch us.</b>

13:22.910 --> 13:26.470
<b>Well, I never expected the people 
here to be of any help.</b>

13:28.320 --> 13:30.030
<b>My gut</b>

13:31.180 --> 13:33.690
<b>tells me that it's here.</b>

13:49.840 --> 13:51.470
<b>Don't move.</b>

13:52.160 --> 13:54.640
<b>If you die, it won't be my fault.</b>

13:55.010 --> 14:00.150
<b>A-A mere animal shouldn't order 
a superior human around!</b>

14:00.490 --> 14:02.990
<b>Mere animal? Superior human?</b>

14:03.500 --> 14:04.960
<b>I don't understand...</b>

14:07.030 --> 14:10.160
<b>How are you and I different?</b>

14:10.490 --> 14:12.280
<b>Shut up!</b>

14:16.380 --> 14:17.680
<b>Good grief...</b>

14:18.430 --> 14:20.850
<b>Didn't your parents ever teach you</b>

14:21.420 --> 14:23.380
<b>to answer a question when you're asked?</b>

14:26.010 --> 14:28.890
<b>There's no hope for you, old-timer.</b>

14:37.940 --> 14:40.310
<b>Try harder in your next life.</b>

14:44.860 --> 14:46.630
<b>Now you've done it.</b>

14:52.700 --> 14:56.270
<b>If you kill him, we aren't able to store him.</b>

14:57.540 --> 15:02.130
<b>I can make meatballs to serve 
to the Queen within the day.</b>

15:03.060 --> 15:06.010
<b>People like him irritate me.</b>

15:06.970 --> 15:09.010
<b>They don't know their place.</b>

15:12.160 --> 15:16.210
<b>I prefer to see them running around in fear.</b>

15:17.320 --> 15:21.520
<b>Yesterday, you shot one in 
the back when they ran.</b>

15:22.010 --> 15:27.810
<b>If you'd let me handle this, I could secure 
our prey in a smarter fashion.</b>

15:29.250 --> 15:32.530
<b>When you said, "Don't move," 
that was meant for me, right?</b>

15:33.010 --> 15:35.330
<b>Giving your squadron leader an order, huh?</b>

15:42.330 --> 15:45.290
<b>Don't get too cocky.</b>

15:45.290 --> 15:48.920
<b>I'm forgiving, so I'll let it slide.</b>

15:49.680 --> 15:54.220
<b>If you enjoy killing so much, you should 
volunteer for the feeding squad.</b>

16:00.080 --> 16:01.570
<b>No hope...</b>

16:14.390 --> 16:15.960
<b><i>Damn that Yunju.</i></b>

16:22.290 --> 16:23.460
<b>Shut up!</b>

16:24.040 --> 16:26.630

16:33.460 --> 16:35.020
<b>Isn't that obvious?</b>

<b>Be more selective with your prey!</b>

16:37.000 --> 16:38.600
<b>How often do I have to repeat myself?</b>

16:39.300 --> 16:41.690
<b>That human won't serve any purpose.</b>

16:42.100 --> 16:44.440
<b>And we've already met our quota for the day.</b>

16:44.440 --> 16:45.850
<b>You're wasting your time.</b>

16:46.210 --> 16:48.360
<b>Then I'll eat it!</b>

16:48.360 --> 16:48.980
<b>What?</b>

16:49.850 --> 16:52.490
<b>It'll be eaten sooner or later, anyway.</b>

16:59.290 --> 17:02.280
<b>This is an order, Rammot.</b>

17:13.620 --> 17:14.710
<b>Damn.</b>

17:15.310 --> 17:17.340
<b>Too many soldiers trying to do things their way.</b>

17:27.950 --> 17:28.770
<b>Huh?</b>

17:29.680 --> 17:31.050
<b>I don't see any problem.</b>

17:31.430 --> 17:33.030
<b>I enjoy what I do.</b>

17:33.950 --> 17:35.940
<b>You want to take this one?</b>

17:36.360 --> 17:38.280
<b>I guess it's dead, so you can't.</b>

17:39.350 --> 17:41.190
<b>Which squadron are you from?</b>

17:45.730 --> 17:48.290
<b>Oh, Zazan...</b>

17:48.290 --> 17:50.290
<b>That nasty woman.</b>

17:51.000 --> 17:52.420
<b>You have my sympathy.</b>

17:54.950 --> 17:58.430
<b>You could join Yunju's team.</b>

17:58.960 --> 18:02.960
<b>I hear that they're allowed to 
kill any humans they want.</b>

18:03.440 --> 18:05.310
<b>If you take this as a gift,</b>

18:05.870 --> 18:08.190
<b>they'll probably let you join on the spot.</b>

18:14.280 --> 18:16.250
<b>What is this?</b>

18:16.250 --> 18:17.530
<b>It's terrible...</b>

18:18.230 --> 18:19.840
<b>Who did this?</b>

18:22.280 --> 18:23.410
<b>A gun?</b>

18:23.740 --> 18:26.320
<b>People are fighting with guns!</b>

18:26.320 --> 18:27.450
<b>Who could it be?</b>

18:27.450 --> 18:29.960
<b>Guns aren't allowed in NGL!</b>

18:30.690 --> 18:35.590
<b>They're members of the NGL 
underground that manufactures D².</b>

18:35.590 --> 18:36.440
<b>Huh?</b>

18:37.080 --> 18:40.780
<b>I don't think these wounds 
were inflicted by humans.</b>

18:41.850 --> 18:43.520
<b>Does that mean...</b>

18:43.520 --> 18:45.500
<b>I can't be certain yet...</b>

18:48.710 --> 18:51.330
<b><i>But if the monster we seek 
was responsible for this,</i></b>

18:52.820 --> 18:55.590
<b><i>we won't be able to handle it 
with our current members.</i></b>

19:00.280 --> 19:01.740
<b>Th-There they are!</b>

19:01.740 --> 19:03.280
<b>Monsters!</b>

19:05.300 --> 19:07.500
<b>Ponzu! Balda! Pekuba!</b>

19:07.920 --> 19:09.590
<b>Run on my signal.</b>

19:13.510 --> 19:14.580
<b>Got it?</b>

19:21.350 --> 19:23.260
<b><i>Rainbow!</i></b>

19:21.410 --> 19:23.260
<b>Seven Spectrum Array</b>

19:24.720 --> 19:26.810
<b>Red Arrow</b>

19:24.790 --> 19:26.300
<b><i>Red Arrow!</i></b>

19:33.040 --> 19:34.060
<b>Now!</b>

19:45.580 --> 19:47.190
<b>No hope.</b>

20:10.430 --> 20:11.520
<b>Over here!</b>

20:22.380 --> 20:23.420
<b>Are you okay?</b>

20:23.750 --> 20:24.660
<b>Yes...</b>

20:25.950 --> 20:29.260
<b>Anyway, we should contact 
the other pro Hunters.</b>

20:29.930 --> 20:31.120
<b>Can you handle that, Ponzu?</b>

20:31.470 --> 20:32.450
<b>Got it.</b>

20:54.810 --> 20:57.470
<b>What? That's it?</b>

20:58.250 --> 21:01.250
<b>No, there are more.</b>

21:04.430 --> 21:07.450
<b>There sure are!</b>

21:07.450 --> 21:10.040
<b>I can smell living humans!</b>

21:30.560 --> 21:32.180
<b>What do we do, Zaikahal?</b>

21:37.320 --> 21:39.740
<b>As the Chimera Ants continue their rampage,</b>

21:39.740 --> 21:43.190
<b>they have cornered the country's shadowy ruler.</b>

21:44.600 --> 21:47.200
<b>A storm brews in NGL.</b>

21:48.270 --> 21:53.680
<b>And Gon's group is heading straight for it.</b>

23:24.830 --> 23:27.320
<b>Next time: Evil x and x Terrible.</b>

23:28.050 --> 23:29.180
<b>Gon, what's wrong?</b>

23:29.180 --> 23:30.210
<b>Do you have a fever?</b>

23:30.830 --> 23:32.730
<b>What? A crick in your back?</b>

23:32.730 --> 23:34.490
<b>Terrible...</b>
