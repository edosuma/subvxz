WEBVTT

00:00.626 --> 00:02.667
Previously, on "Below Deck"...

00:02.667 --> 00:03.918
They're gonna hook up,
straight up.

00:03.918 --> 00:05.542
I think so.

00:05.542 --> 00:08.501
Oh, Rayna, why did you do this?

00:08.501 --> 00:11.042
We wanna give you the
opportunity to be lead deckhand.

00:11.042 --> 00:12.751
-Thank you.
-Do me well.

00:12.751 --> 00:16.375
-Swear to God, you better.
-Thank you, Captain. Thank you.

00:16.375 --> 00:18.709
The primary charter guest
is Michael Durham,

00:18.709 --> 00:20.918
a Seattle-based
real estate broker.

00:20.918 --> 00:23.709
Joining Michael are
his other broker friends.

00:23.709 --> 00:29.209
And they wanna do a Hawaiian
luau on day number two.

00:29.209 --> 00:33.000
-Cheers.
-Welcome to St. Kitts.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.209
If you wouldn't mind
putting more bourbon in that?

00:35.209 --> 00:37.209
Of course I can.
They don't belong on a yacht.

00:37.209 --> 00:38.667
They probably won this trip.

00:38.667 --> 00:40.876
I'm sorry, how many words
do you use a day?

00:40.876 --> 00:43.584
Usually they start
with [bleep] you.

00:43.584 --> 00:44.792
You can just
go [bleep] yourselves

00:44.792 --> 00:45.918
Justin!

00:45.918 --> 00:47.209
I'm throwing myself
off the boat.

00:47.209 --> 00:48.292
Morons.

00:48.292 --> 00:49.501
And I'll take
my ----ing bourbon

00:49.501 --> 00:51.000
in a ----ing coffee cup,
thank you.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.292
Thank you for dinner.

00:52.292 --> 00:53.501
-Good night.
-Get some rest.

00:53.501 --> 00:54.918
Justin, what are you doing?

00:54.918 --> 00:56.209
Look at me, in the...
in my eyes.

00:56.209 --> 00:58.292
-Go [bleep] yourself.
-Okay.

00:58.292 --> 01:00.042
I'm just nervous
something's gonna happen

01:00.042 --> 01:01.417
that we can't control.

01:01.417 --> 01:03.542
I think it's best we all just...

01:03.542 --> 01:05.334
No, go [bleep] yourself and
throw yourself off the boat.

01:05.334 --> 01:07.459
-Two fingers or one?
-Three, actually.

01:07.459 --> 01:08.959
Hold on...
no, come here.

01:08.959 --> 01:13.292
[sobbing]

01:13.292 --> 01:14.542
What the [bleep]?

01:14.542 --> 01:15.709
Oh sh--.

01:15.709 --> 01:21.667
-Just...
-No, can I stop this?

01:21.667 --> 01:23.709
This is a whole ----ing
circus, isn't it?

01:23.709 --> 01:26.042
There'll be somebody jumping
off this boat tonight.

01:26.042 --> 01:27.292
Maybe it's just best if you
just kind of just, like,

01:27.292 --> 01:28.584
stay away from each
other right now.

01:28.584 --> 01:29.209
Oh sh--.

01:29.209 --> 01:31.542
No, can I stop this right now?

01:31.542 --> 01:32.834
[bleep] my life.

01:32.834 --> 01:34.334
No, seriously, can I stop?

01:34.334 --> 01:36.209
You stop kind of interacting,
then we will stop.

01:36.209 --> 01:38.000
I'm trying, I'm like,
I have...

01:38.000 --> 01:39.626
But we don't...

01:39.626 --> 01:41.250
I know, it's been a long day
for everyone.

01:41.250 --> 01:42.626
Put her in a room and tell
her to shut the [bleep] up.

01:42.626 --> 01:44.250
Let's stay away
from him right now.

01:44.250 --> 01:46.375
It's for everyone's safety,
including yours.

01:46.375 --> 01:48.000
It's not my problem.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.667
Hey, I don't give a [bleep].

01:49.667 --> 01:51.042
-Can I walk you down the stairs?
-Yes.

01:51.042 --> 01:53.000
-This way.
-That'd be good.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
I hope somebody gets
pissed off for real.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.125
All right, I'm going
to sleep, I'm done.

01:56.125 --> 01:57.125
-You're done?
-Yeah.

01:57.125 --> 01:58.292
Cool.

01:58.292 --> 01:59.292
Anything else that
I can get you?

01:59.292 --> 02:00.792
-Yeah. Nope.
-Okay.

02:00.792 --> 02:01.918
-Good, thank you.
-You have a good night.

02:01.918 --> 02:03.459
Hi, how's it going?

02:03.459 --> 02:04.918
We need to get him in his room.

02:04.918 --> 02:06.125
Yep.

02:06.125 --> 02:08.125
What's your problem?

02:08.125 --> 02:10.292
Everybody can go [bleep]
themselves at this point.

02:10.292 --> 02:11.918
Gimme that. Now.

02:11.918 --> 02:13.292
No, you go [bleep] yourself
and throw yourself

02:13.292 --> 02:15.083
off the back of the boat.

02:15.083 --> 02:16.709
What the [bleep] happened
at dinner?

02:16.709 --> 02:19.834
Because what I saw at
the swim platform, bitch...

02:19.834 --> 02:21.042
What happened?

02:21.042 --> 02:22.918
Do me a favor and walk with me.

02:22.918 --> 02:24.334
Well, okay, so, you know what...

02:24.334 --> 02:26.083
You can bring
that with you, just...

02:26.083 --> 02:29.167
Hey, this is some ----ing sh--
that's ----ing sideways.

02:29.167 --> 02:33.042
Shut the [bleep] up.

02:33.042 --> 02:35.125
I can't wait to tell
Captain Lee about this.

02:35.125 --> 02:45.209
I don't know what he's gonna do,
but it's gonna be priceless.

02:45.209 --> 02:46.709
Get your sh-- do what
you gotta do, and go down.

02:46.709 --> 02:48.584
And if there's any issues,
you wake me up.

02:48.584 --> 02:51.584
Thank you for everything,
I appreciate it.

02:51.584 --> 02:55.334
Oh, Lord.

02:55.334 --> 03:08.250
[snoring]

03:08.250 --> 03:10.501
Ooh, da, da, da.

03:10.501 --> 03:11.626
Hey, buddy,
how you doing?

03:11.626 --> 03:13.000
-Good, how are you?
-Good.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.918
It's good to be at
the top of the food chain.

03:14.918 --> 03:15.667
Good morning!

03:15.667 --> 03:17.501
Good morning, love,
how are you?

03:17.501 --> 03:19.584
The white shirt on the counter
is Captain Lee's

03:19.584 --> 03:21.667
so let's get it to him
by 6:00 tonight.

03:21.667 --> 03:25.501
Does it need to
be washed too, yeah?

03:25.501 --> 03:27.918
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Okay.

03:27.918 --> 03:30.876
My last boat was a cakewalk.

03:30.876 --> 03:32.959
They just did the same
routine every day,

03:32.959 --> 03:37.834
and it was nice, because we got
to get off the boat and explore.

03:37.834 --> 03:39.709
I don't really do
much of that here.

03:39.709 --> 03:42.000
When do I get a day off?
When can I go out on a boat?

03:42.000 --> 03:45.167
When can I do something nice?

03:45.167 --> 03:51.792
I hope so.

03:51.792 --> 03:53.959
Hey, hey, hey.

03:53.959 --> 03:55.959
Everything is shiny.

03:55.959 --> 03:58.209
When do you think the rest of
our group will be awake?

03:58.209 --> 04:01.000
I would be surprised
if any of them are up

04:01.000 --> 04:02.125
in the next several hours.

04:02.125 --> 04:04.083
----ing hungry.

04:04.083 --> 04:08.459
This is so ----ing gross, dude.

04:08.459 --> 04:13.125
-Morning, Cap.
-Morning, Eddie.

04:13.125 --> 04:14.709
Did you hear a bunch
of screaming

04:14.709 --> 04:16.918
and slamming doors and
yelling and crying, and...

04:16.918 --> 04:18.167
No.

04:18.167 --> 04:22.501
I'm coming in.

04:22.501 --> 04:27.042
Well, I don't know,
because I went to bed early.

04:27.042 --> 04:28.876
It was Justin and Terri arguing.

04:28.876 --> 04:31.209
I mean, he told Heather
to go [bleep] herself.

04:31.209 --> 04:34.876
Terri was just bawling,
in tears.

04:34.876 --> 04:36.167
Heather can fill you in
on quite a lot about it.

04:36.167 --> 04:37.709
-Good.
-Good morning.

04:37.709 --> 04:39.167
Good morning, so, let's discuss
the elephant in the room.

04:39.167 --> 04:40.459
Sure thing.

04:40.459 --> 04:42.709
Yeah, it just was starting
to get really abrasive.

04:42.709 --> 04:44.167
They crossed
the line hardcore.

04:44.167 --> 04:46.209
I am not going to tolerate this.

04:46.209 --> 04:47.417
I'm livid.

04:47.417 --> 04:49.751
Pissed on chickens
can't compare.

04:49.751 --> 04:52.042
My crew is not here
to be abused.

04:52.042 --> 04:54.375
I can't talk to them right now,
because I'll lose it.

04:54.375 --> 04:56.792
But this will be
a come-to-Jesus meeting.

04:56.792 --> 04:59.167
I'm gonna have a
discussion with them...

04:59.167 --> 05:00.292
Correct.

05:00.292 --> 05:01.292
As soon as we get
to the anchorage.

05:01.292 --> 05:02.542
Okay.

05:02.542 --> 05:04.709
This is not going
to happen again.

05:04.709 --> 05:06.209
Okay.

05:06.209 --> 05:07.542
Good morning.

05:07.542 --> 05:09.250
-[belches]
-Beg your pardon?

05:09.250 --> 05:10.667
-Sorry!
-Good morning.

05:10.667 --> 05:13.542
I just, like, chugged
an entire coffee.

05:13.542 --> 05:15.125
I still wanna know
exactly what happened.

05:15.125 --> 05:17.584
I do, and at
the same time, like...

05:17.584 --> 05:22.209
-Perhaps not.
-Yeah.

05:22.209 --> 05:24.709
Deck meeting, I wanted
to talk about beach setup.

05:24.709 --> 05:27.292
We'll bring a couple
of these plants, tiki torches,

05:27.292 --> 05:29.167
and chairs and tables.

05:29.167 --> 05:32.083
And so what I'm thinking is me
and Wes doing the beach setup.

05:32.083 --> 05:33.417
Okay, nice.

05:33.417 --> 05:35.501
And Rayna can stay on the boat
and just tidying up

05:35.501 --> 05:37.834
on bridge deck aft,
make sure the teak's all nice.

05:37.834 --> 05:40.501
And then we're gonna
change the schedules,

05:40.501 --> 05:41.959
so Wes is on earlies.

05:41.959 --> 05:43.083
Okay.

05:43.083 --> 05:44.876
I'm on days,
which means I can be...

05:44.876 --> 05:46.667
help with the morning setup
and help at the end of the day,

05:46.667 --> 05:48.459
and then you're on lates.

05:48.459 --> 05:49.876
For the rest of this charter

05:49.876 --> 05:51.125
we're gonna stick
to that schedule.

05:51.125 --> 05:52.918
Wait, back it up.

05:52.918 --> 05:55.250
People need, like, switching,
like, you know, like...

05:55.250 --> 05:57.375
We can switch on
different charters.

05:57.375 --> 05:59.584
Imma die if
I'm up every night late.

05:59.584 --> 06:01.167
You're still getting
your eight hours.

06:01.167 --> 06:04.375
The first charter, we had
switched off on our schedules.

06:04.375 --> 06:06.125
But now, Jake wants
us to keep the same shift

06:06.125 --> 06:08.167
for the whole charter.

06:08.167 --> 06:09.417
You're up super-late, and then
the next day, then you're...

06:09.417 --> 06:10.918
-Well, I...
-I want...

06:10.918 --> 06:12.959
-This is how I want it, okay?
-Okay, fine.

06:12.959 --> 06:16.000
Honestly, Rayna is overreacting,
and Jake's being bossy.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.209
And here I am,
caught in the middle.

06:18.209 --> 06:24.083
This is great.

06:24.083 --> 06:25.042
How hungry are we?

06:25.042 --> 06:26.501
Would you to make
a special order?

06:26.501 --> 06:28.709
I hear rumor
there's lobster Benedict.

06:28.709 --> 06:30.083
Beautiful, coming right up.

06:30.083 --> 06:32.125
-Jake, Jake, Lee.
-Go ahead, Lee.

06:32.125 --> 06:33.167
To the bridge, please.

06:33.167 --> 06:36.167
Copy, on my way.

06:36.167 --> 06:40.000
Yes, please,
that would be lovely.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.042
We're gonna be pulling the
anchor here in a few minutes,

06:43.042 --> 06:45.709
so I expect clear,
concise directions.

06:45.709 --> 06:47.501
-Yeah.
-Okay, get your crew together.

06:47.501 --> 06:48.751
-Will do.
-We're leaving soon.

06:48.751 --> 06:49.709
Okay.

06:49.709 --> 06:51.542
And I'm gonna let
you take us outta here,

06:51.542 --> 06:53.042
so we'll see how you do.

06:53.042 --> 06:54.918
Yeah, copy that.

06:54.918 --> 06:57.000
Wes, Rayna, can the two of
you meet me on the bow, please?

06:57.000 --> 07:01.751
Copy that.

07:01.751 --> 07:03.042
Are you checking on the chain?

07:03.042 --> 07:04.083
Yeah.

07:04.083 --> 07:05.584
Are we good to start hoisting?

07:05.584 --> 07:08.417
Yeah, bring her in.

07:08.417 --> 07:11.375
Is that what we can smell?

07:11.375 --> 07:14.083
Short stay, 12:00.

07:14.083 --> 07:15.542
Short stay, 9:00.

07:15.542 --> 07:17.000
Wonderful, thank you.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.918
This is done as a béarnaise,

07:18.918 --> 07:21.125
with tarragon to go
with the lobster.

07:21.125 --> 07:22.250
-Fantastic.
-Please enjoy.

07:22.250 --> 07:24.167
Anchor off the bottom.

07:24.167 --> 07:25.000
What do you need to say?

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
Home, locking off.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.334
Good.

07:27.334 --> 07:31.834
Can you do the
anchor ball, please?

07:31.834 --> 07:33.501
Good morning.

07:33.501 --> 07:34.542
Hey.

07:34.542 --> 07:37.375
Wow, that is the best breakfast
I've ever had.

07:37.375 --> 07:42.709
Good morning, how are you?

07:42.709 --> 07:44.709
-This light has gone off.
-Yep.

07:44.709 --> 07:47.250
So, now you can just
turn that knob.

07:47.250 --> 07:49.000
You have to push
down on it to turn.

07:49.000 --> 07:53.459
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

07:53.459 --> 07:54.792
What does that mean?

07:54.792 --> 07:56.167
Like, you're not
happy about this.

07:56.167 --> 07:57.417
No, but I'm not in charge,

07:57.417 --> 07:59.501
so I'm going with
the flow, you know?

07:59.501 --> 08:01.209
No, you're giving me
sh-- about it.

08:01.209 --> 08:04.209
I haven't said anything.
I'm quiet, I just need to be...

08:04.209 --> 08:07.083
like, when I'm frustrated,
I just need some alone...

08:07.083 --> 08:08.959
There's nothing
to be frustrated about.

08:08.959 --> 08:10.751
It's work.
That's what it is.

08:10.751 --> 08:12.209
It's what we're here to do.

08:12.209 --> 08:13.167
You don't think I know that?

08:13.167 --> 08:14.959
That's a joke, right?

08:14.959 --> 08:17.959
Jake is confusing, but
then again, I don't know Jake.

08:17.959 --> 08:19.626
So, what if he is
just this crazy person

08:19.626 --> 08:21.542
and I just kissed
him too soon?

08:21.542 --> 08:23.751
I most differently
kissed him too soon,

08:23.751 --> 08:25.209
because he's a jackass now.

08:25.209 --> 08:26.959
-I'll be fine, just...
-All right.

08:26.959 --> 08:39.292
Ugh.

08:39.292 --> 08:45.667
Good morning, how are you?

08:45.667 --> 08:48.542
I've never had a guest treat me
like this in my career.

08:48.542 --> 08:50.501
Go [bleep] yourself and
throw yourself off the boat.

08:50.501 --> 08:52.167
This is reminding me
a lot of when

08:52.167 --> 08:53.542
I was bullied in high school.

08:53.542 --> 08:55.834
Growing up in Hawaii,
I had my arm broken,

08:55.834 --> 08:59.042
I've had my face spat in, I've
had lunches thrown at me because

08:59.042 --> 09:02.626
I was just the only white,
blonde girl in my school.

09:02.626 --> 09:05.334
So, it's just bringing up
a lot of trauma

09:05.334 --> 09:10.042
from my childhood
and being bullied.

09:10.042 --> 09:13.000
Last night was a screaming
match between the guests.

09:13.000 --> 09:18.334
This is gonna be
an interesting trip.

09:18.334 --> 09:20.751
Jake, Jake, is
the anchor ready for drop?

09:20.751 --> 09:21.709
Yeah.

09:21.709 --> 09:26.334
All right, go ahead
and drop her, two shots.

09:26.334 --> 09:27.334
You're stuck.

09:27.334 --> 09:28.584
All right, I think we're stuck,

09:28.584 --> 09:29.709
you can go ahead and
lock her in.

09:29.709 --> 09:30.959
-Nice job, Jake.
-Thank you.

09:30.959 --> 09:31.959
Well done, Eddie.

09:31.959 --> 09:33.209
Thank you very much, Captain,
I appreciate it.

09:33.209 --> 09:35.209
I like this anchorage.

09:35.209 --> 09:36.334
There's a little bit of a
roll to it, but it's not bad.

09:36.334 --> 09:42.167
How are we feeling?

09:42.167 --> 09:43.709
Heather, Heather, Lee,

09:43.709 --> 09:46.876
I need Michael and Justin, and
I need them in the wheelhouse.

09:46.876 --> 09:48.375
Copy that.

09:48.375 --> 09:49.834
Oh, God, here we go.

09:49.834 --> 09:52.626
Michael and Justin,
Captain Lee would love

09:52.626 --> 09:53.876
to see you in the wheelhouse.

09:53.876 --> 09:54.751
-Ugh.
-Okay.

09:54.751 --> 09:56.876
Ooh, would not wanna
be them right now.

09:56.876 --> 10:00.209
I'm sure as sh-- not gonna let
some asshole insult my crew.

10:00.209 --> 10:03.292
It makes me wanna take a sh--
in his mother's dinner plate.

10:03.292 --> 10:03.292
-[knocking]
-Come on in.

10:03.292 --> 10:18.667
Previously, on "Below Deck"...

10:18.667 --> 10:34.167
-[knocking]
-Come on in.

10:34.167 --> 10:38.417
Telling Heather to go [bleep]
herself was totally improper.

10:38.417 --> 10:40.834
I don't talk to
my crew that way,

10:40.834 --> 10:45.834
and I will not tolerate
anyone else doing it.

10:45.834 --> 10:48.125
I wish I had context as
to why or how that happened.

10:48.125 --> 10:50.542
-I'm very so...
-I don't want the excuses.

10:50.542 --> 10:54.042
Just get your
sh-- together.

10:54.042 --> 10:57.667
If that behavior happens again,
your charter will be over.

10:57.667 --> 11:00.834
-Yes, sir.
-Make no mistake about it.

11:00.834 --> 11:04.709
Understood.
I really am sorry.

11:04.709 --> 11:05.834
-Thank you.
-Yep.

11:05.834 --> 11:11.042
And I apologize for my friends.

11:11.042 --> 11:13.542
Yes, I think so.

11:13.542 --> 11:15.042
How was that?

11:15.042 --> 11:16.918
I don't think we'll have
a repeat performance.

11:16.918 --> 11:19.459
If we do, the charter will end.

11:19.459 --> 11:21.334
All right, let's see
how the day goes.

11:21.334 --> 11:24.000
Indeed.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.542
For my part in it, as it relates
to you guys, I'm very sorry.

11:27.542 --> 11:30.501
I really am.

11:30.501 --> 11:32.125
I need you to go
start packing up all the gear

11:32.125 --> 11:36.250
for the beach picnic right now.

11:36.250 --> 11:37.459
Ba-ba-bing.

11:37.459 --> 11:42.209
Oh, no... oh, yes.

11:42.209 --> 11:50.292
[bleep] me.

11:50.292 --> 11:52.167
Oh sh--.

11:52.167 --> 11:53.584
Oh, that looks awesome.

11:53.584 --> 11:55.000
We do wanna discuss.

11:55.000 --> 12:00.167
So, we're gonna be cooking
the pig on the beach,

12:00.167 --> 12:03.083
-Yeah.
-Right.

12:03.083 --> 12:09.167
I'm experienced with
cooking the whole hog.

12:09.167 --> 12:10.167
For shizzle.

12:10.167 --> 12:11.000
Okay, cool.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.209
Logistically, it takes way
too long to cook the pig

12:13.209 --> 12:16.042
at the beach, so I precook
it in the oven

12:16.042 --> 12:18.125
and then I'm going
to throw it in the pit

12:18.125 --> 12:20.292
and when the guests
arrive on the beach,

12:20.292 --> 12:22.584
I'm going to pull it out
and be like,

12:22.584 --> 12:27.375
"It's done, fire-roasted
pig on a spit!"

12:27.375 --> 12:30.501
Gotcha, bitch!

12:30.501 --> 12:34.501
I want to apologize sincerely,
I am so sorry.

12:34.501 --> 12:36.167
Get 'em girl.

12:36.167 --> 12:38.000
-I appreciate the apology.
-Thank you.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.459
I really do.
But every day's a new day.

12:40.459 --> 12:42.250
-I appreciate it.
-Enjoy the blank page.

12:42.250 --> 12:43.834
Very good, thank you so much.

12:43.834 --> 12:45.083
Pleasure's all mine.

12:45.083 --> 12:48.459
But really,
go [bleep] yourself.

12:48.459 --> 12:50.209
Wes and Jake,
get into your wet gear

12:50.209 --> 12:56.042
and meet me on the
swim platform in 20 minutes.

12:56.042 --> 12:58.000
I'll pass off
the champagne first.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.042
Thank you, Heather,
appreciate it.

12:59.042 --> 13:07.042
Of course.

13:07.042 --> 13:13.167
Time to go.

13:13.167 --> 13:19.459
All right, your free.

13:19.459 --> 13:22.709
I love these beaches.

13:22.709 --> 13:25.834
I grew up in the Caribbean,
so I love doing beach picnics.

13:25.834 --> 13:28.125
They very much
so remind me of home.

13:28.125 --> 13:32.792
Hope I'm not getting homesick,
but yes, they do, they do.

13:32.792 --> 13:36.083
Ah!

13:36.083 --> 13:38.501
We need paper towel
and trash bags.

13:38.501 --> 13:39.709
Yeah, and toilet paper,
I was thinking.

13:39.709 --> 13:41.209
Where would they...

13:41.209 --> 13:44.042
I'll leave you two
to that conversation.

13:44.042 --> 13:46.334
It is very important to me
that this luau

13:46.334 --> 13:48.083
goes off without a hitch.

13:48.083 --> 13:51.042
So, we just dice up the tuna,
you do Kewpie, Sriracha...

13:51.042 --> 13:52.834
Mm-hmm.

13:52.834 --> 13:54.042
And, like, the tamago eggs,
the orange fish eggs?

13:54.042 --> 13:55.000
Yeah.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.751
I didn't deal with
everything yesterday

13:56.751 --> 13:58.375
to come out of this
getting a sh-- tip.

13:58.375 --> 14:00.000
I guess I can do saimin noodles?

14:00.000 --> 14:04.000
Yeah.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.751
Even if it takes 20 tender rides

14:05.751 --> 14:07.584
to get these guests
what they want,

14:07.584 --> 14:09.792
there's no room for error today.

14:09.792 --> 14:12.167
Gotta make my people proud.

14:12.167 --> 14:14.042
-Good job, guys.
-Okay.

14:14.042 --> 14:16.083
Get that fire going
soon, too, okay?

14:16.083 --> 14:17.792
Durham, you're wearing
different shorts today.

14:17.792 --> 14:19.042
-Ooh, that's good.
-Yeah.

14:19.042 --> 14:21.334
We have a trunk contest,
apparently.

14:21.334 --> 14:24.334
Could we call it a swimsuit
contest and not a trunk contest?

14:24.334 --> 14:26.125
We could call it
a trunk contest,

14:26.125 --> 14:28.125
but it'd be a different kind
of contest, and I'd win.

14:28.125 --> 14:29.709
You know how elephants
have a trunk?

14:29.709 --> 14:31.709
Oh...

14:31.709 --> 14:38.292
All right, fireman,
it's all you, brother.

14:38.292 --> 14:41.334
All right, all right.

14:41.334 --> 14:43.083
I'm take Jess,
we're gonna set up,

14:43.083 --> 14:45.209
and then I'm gonna come back
and trade out with you.

14:45.209 --> 14:49.125
-You'll handle cocktails.
-Take the piggy now.

14:49.125 --> 14:50.209
Can we get you anything
at the moment?

14:50.209 --> 14:51.501
Beautiful.

14:51.501 --> 14:53.209
How long do you think
we might be?

14:53.209 --> 14:54.542
-Just curious, that's all.
-Probably, like, 45 minutes.

14:54.542 --> 14:55.834
-Perfect.
-Whew!

14:55.834 --> 14:58.584
-Thank you.
-Thank you, Jess.

14:58.584 --> 15:00.209
Beautiful.

15:00.209 --> 15:02.000
We have everything, dude.

15:02.000 --> 15:05.209
Hopefully can go get off
here and go play a game.

15:05.209 --> 15:06.792
I wanna swim in.

15:06.792 --> 15:09.167
You better start now.

15:09.167 --> 15:15.876
-Hi!
-How's it going?

15:15.876 --> 15:18.209
Oh, come on, you bastard.

15:18.209 --> 15:20.417
Do not let anything
happen to the pig.

15:20.417 --> 15:22.042
-Eddie, Lee.
-Go for Eddie.

15:22.042 --> 15:24.209
Yeah, so your next run'll
be taking the guests in.

15:24.209 --> 15:25.959
Copy that.

15:25.959 --> 15:27.834
Ugh, so tired.

15:27.834 --> 15:31.167
It's ----ing exhausting,
being a stewardess all day long.

15:31.167 --> 15:32.751
This is, like, so much.

15:32.751 --> 15:34.709
Well, the money makes
it worth it,

15:34.709 --> 15:37.417
but I would much rather be
at home, just driving around,

15:37.417 --> 15:40.125
eating my burrito,
listening to my music.

15:40.125 --> 15:42.000
Of course, and it's
a lot less stressful

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
than what I'm doing right now.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.083
♪ I'm covered in sand
and I love it ♪

15:47.083 --> 15:49.459
You guys can go ahead and
put the pig on the fire.

15:49.459 --> 15:51.542
Oh, have you ever
read "Lord of the Flies?"

15:51.542 --> 15:53.167
I've read it in school.

15:53.167 --> 15:56.667
This reminds me of it.

15:56.667 --> 15:58.542
What time is it?

15:58.542 --> 15:59.959
It's almost 3:00.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.417
Let's go eat this pig.

16:01.417 --> 16:03.000
Yeah, bitch.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.292
All right, Eddie, we're ready
for you to load guests.

16:05.292 --> 16:08.209
Okay, loading guests.
Be there shortly.

16:08.209 --> 16:09.375
You guys ready to
get loaded up?

16:09.375 --> 16:10.417
-Yep.
-Yes, sir.

16:10.417 --> 16:15.459
Absolutely.

16:15.459 --> 16:16.792
No worries.

16:16.792 --> 16:18.042
-Awesome!
-Enjoy, you guys.

16:18.042 --> 16:19.042
-Okay.
-Thank you much.

16:19.042 --> 16:20.042
-Thank you.
-Bye!

16:20.042 --> 16:21.375
Ooh!

16:21.375 --> 16:22.834
No!

16:22.834 --> 16:25.584
[bleep] hell,
Rachel, the pig's on fire!

16:25.584 --> 16:27.584
-Oh, no, no, no!
-[bleep]

16:27.584 --> 16:29.042
Oh, [bleep].

16:29.042 --> 16:30.709
This has the potential
of ruining the meal.

16:30.709 --> 16:33.167
This is not good.
Goddamn it.

16:33.167 --> 16:34.167
Well, I'm hungry.

16:34.167 --> 16:36.083
I'd chew off my arm
if I had barbeque sauce.

16:36.083 --> 16:44.000
Oh, my God.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.626
[bleep]
oh, no...

16:45.626 --> 16:46.959
-Rachel?
-Oh [bleep].

16:46.959 --> 16:48.167
-No, no, no!
-I've got a towel.

16:48.167 --> 16:49.751
-Son of a bitch.
-Enjoy, you guys!

16:49.751 --> 16:51.000
-Okay.
-Thank you much.

16:51.000 --> 16:51.751
Bye!

16:51.751 --> 16:53.167
I'm hungry.

16:53.167 --> 16:54.042
Now, flip it on top of this,
steady.

16:54.042 --> 16:57.250
-Watch your hands.
-Got it.

16:57.250 --> 16:58.584
Pull it up.

16:58.584 --> 17:00.167
Oop, my hands have
gone in there.

17:00.167 --> 17:01.167
Yeah, it needed to
come out a little bit sooner.

17:01.167 --> 17:02.876
Thank God it's only the skin.

17:02.876 --> 17:07.417
Flip it upside-down,
and they'll never know.

17:07.417 --> 17:08.542
Got it?

17:08.542 --> 17:09.709
Cool, thank you.

17:09.709 --> 17:12.792
Welcome, welcome!

17:12.792 --> 17:15.167
Aloha!

17:15.167 --> 17:17.375
Welcome to your beach luau.

17:17.375 --> 17:18.626
-Awesome.
-Thank you!

17:18.626 --> 17:19.751
-Thank you so much.
-Of course.

17:19.751 --> 17:21.709
-Fantastic.
-Wow.

17:21.709 --> 17:22.792
Everything's perfect.

17:22.792 --> 17:24.792
Looks great, guys, nice job.

17:24.792 --> 17:27.000
[phone rings]

17:27.000 --> 17:28.167
Hello?

17:28.167 --> 17:31.042
I'm ready to kill
somebody, literally.

17:31.042 --> 17:33.083
Because Jake's been
lead deckhand

17:33.083 --> 17:36.000
for a whole ----ing day, and he
talked to me so disrespectful.

17:36.000 --> 17:39.417
But I'm not ----ing perfect,
you know what I'm saying.

17:39.417 --> 17:41.626
Like, it's ----ing annoying.

17:41.626 --> 17:44.626
Connecting with new people
on a boat is just difficult.

17:44.626 --> 17:46.709
Then the person that I was
connecting with was Jake,

17:46.709 --> 17:55.501
the person I'm having
the issues with.

17:55.501 --> 17:57.918
Today's just been sh--
for me, you know?

17:57.918 --> 18:00.501
I'm just over it.
Like, absolutely over it.

18:00.501 --> 18:02.000
Mom, let me call you right back.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.083
I wanna go see if the boat's
gonna be back soon.

18:04.083 --> 18:05.334
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

18:05.334 --> 18:07.209
Okay, now we're
at a beach party.

18:07.209 --> 18:13.709
Now we're at a luau.

18:13.709 --> 18:15.000
Oh!

18:15.000 --> 18:17.501
-The wind just knocked it down.
-Yes.

18:17.501 --> 18:20.083
-There you go.
-Get!

18:20.083 --> 18:21.292
I'm gonna have to
get the shotgun out.

18:21.292 --> 18:23.209
That fly's really
starting to annoy me.

18:23.209 --> 18:25.042
We're gonna swap out Jess.
Can you tell Eddie?

18:25.042 --> 18:26.209
Eddie, could you please
pick up Jess?

18:26.209 --> 18:28.125
Copy that, coming
to pick up Jess.

18:28.125 --> 18:29.626
I think the first most
important is just wipe down,

18:29.626 --> 18:31.584
make the welcome towels, and
then clear the crew mess table.

18:31.584 --> 18:33.042
You got it.

18:33.042 --> 18:34.042
Could you kind of
help tidy up a little bit?

18:34.042 --> 18:35.083
Okay, cool.

18:35.083 --> 18:37.209
There's the tun...
uh, the salmon.

18:37.209 --> 18:40.000
So, this is some lomi lomi style
salmon, would you like some?

18:40.000 --> 18:41.667
Yes, please.

18:41.667 --> 18:43.125
Yum!

18:43.125 --> 18:44.167
-Would you like some white rice?
-Yes, please.

18:44.167 --> 18:45.334
Ah!

18:45.334 --> 18:47.209
So, you're gonna take one
of these nori leaves,

18:47.209 --> 18:49.501
your gonna put the Spam,
the white rice on top of this,

18:49.501 --> 18:51.083
and kind of roll
it into a little taco,

18:51.083 --> 18:52.584
and it's to die for.

18:52.584 --> 18:54.042
This is your homeland, isn't it?

18:54.042 --> 18:55.918
As Hawaiians, I'm very thankful,

18:55.918 --> 19:00.000
because for someone who isn't
Hawaiian, Chef Rachel killed it.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.250
Jesus Christ, that's good.

19:01.250 --> 19:03.417
This is the little taste
of home that I need.

19:03.417 --> 19:06.709
We'd always go to our
cousins' houses for luaus.

19:06.709 --> 19:08.083
It brings people together,

19:08.083 --> 19:10.501
it's a lot of fun,
and I mean, look at Justin.

19:10.501 --> 19:14.083
He went from being an asshole to
a chill kitty-cat on the beach.

19:14.083 --> 19:15.083
How you doing, Terri?

19:15.083 --> 19:16.083
-Good.
-Yeah?

19:16.083 --> 19:17.501
Yeah.

19:17.501 --> 19:19.125
Well, we're doing better than
last night, so that's a start.

19:19.125 --> 19:21.083
-Yeah.
-That is the power of a luau.

19:21.083 --> 19:27.125
[humming]

19:27.125 --> 19:29.042
-Thank you so much.
-Of course.

19:29.042 --> 19:30.167
Thank you for the ride.

19:30.167 --> 19:31.209
My pleasure.

19:31.209 --> 19:33.834
-Cheers, brü.
-There, brü.

19:33.834 --> 19:35.209
Thanks, brü.

19:35.209 --> 19:37.042
Eddie, Eddie, Rachel.

19:37.042 --> 19:38.083
Yeah, go for Eddie.

19:38.083 --> 19:39.459
We'd like to go back.

19:39.459 --> 19:41.334
Copy that, I'll be
on my way shortly.

19:41.334 --> 19:42.584
Are we taking
everything down, then?

19:42.584 --> 19:44.250
Yeah.

19:44.250 --> 19:46.209
All right, I'm gonna leave you
in the hands of sweet Fraser.

19:46.209 --> 19:50.459
♪ I love being
by myself at work ♪

19:50.459 --> 19:51.918
-Thank you.
-Is that everybody?

19:51.918 --> 19:53.042
-Yeah.
-Cool.

19:53.042 --> 19:54.083
Cheers, guys, thank you.

19:54.083 --> 19:55.083
-Oh!
-Oh!

19:55.083 --> 19:56.167
Yeah!

19:56.167 --> 19:57.751
I could have done worse,
put it that way.

19:57.751 --> 19:59.042
That was good,
that was really good.

19:59.042 --> 20:00.375
Thank you for
letting me try that.

20:00.375 --> 20:01.709
-Careful, careful, careful.
-Watch out for dust.

20:01.709 --> 20:03.042
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

20:03.042 --> 20:10.876
Welcome, welcome.

20:10.876 --> 20:12.083
Jake, Jake, Eddie.

20:12.083 --> 20:13.501
Hey, is everything going
all right over there?

20:13.501 --> 20:15.125
Yeah, everything's going fine.

20:15.125 --> 20:17.542
The guests would like to come
back in about 10 minutes.

20:17.542 --> 20:18.959
Grab that ladder so the guests

20:18.959 --> 20:20.209
can come aboard
the tender easily.

20:20.209 --> 20:23.542
Copy.

20:23.542 --> 20:25.542
Do you need help?

20:25.542 --> 20:27.209
-Don't fart!
-Yeah, I did it.

20:27.209 --> 20:28.209
-Stay away.
-No!

20:28.209 --> 20:29.667
Come on!

20:29.667 --> 20:30.667
Gimme a second, let
me set the ladder up.

20:30.667 --> 20:31.959
No problem.

20:31.959 --> 20:33.292
I'm glad you guys
had a good time.

20:33.292 --> 20:34.542
-It was amazing, yeah.
-Wonderful time, thank you.

20:34.542 --> 20:36.375
Good, good, good.

20:36.375 --> 20:38.459
-Knock-knock.
-Come on in.

20:38.459 --> 20:39.667
Very successful.

20:39.667 --> 20:42.125
They played a couple
of beach games.

20:42.125 --> 20:43.250
Cool.

20:43.250 --> 20:44.667
How's Justin doing?

20:44.667 --> 20:46.417
-He's doing good.
-Good for him.

20:46.417 --> 20:48.042
He really is,
they're very sweet.

20:48.042 --> 20:49.042
I'm glad to see somebody
make a shot at redemption.

20:49.042 --> 20:50.000
You guys ready?

20:50.000 --> 20:51.459
I'm gonna hand you
the most important part.

20:51.459 --> 20:53.083
I got you, the drink.

20:53.083 --> 20:55.584
The deck team did awesome,
the interior team did great.

20:55.584 --> 20:59.209
-Nicely done.
-Thank you so much.

20:59.209 --> 21:01.667
Okay, and we'll just start
chucking everything there.

21:01.667 --> 21:04.459
-May I indulge you?
-Thank you!

21:04.459 --> 21:06.083
I gotta admit, guys, this is
not a bad way to end the day.

21:06.083 --> 21:07.125
Right.

21:07.125 --> 21:15.125
I have to rinse the salt
off me, I'm so stinky.

21:15.125 --> 21:17.167
Jesus!

21:17.167 --> 21:18.709
Oh, I'm hurting.

21:18.709 --> 21:21.083
Oh, that was a big day,
that was...

21:21.083 --> 21:22.292
Ah.

21:22.292 --> 21:26.626
You guys killed it.

21:26.626 --> 21:28.959
All right, lines across.

21:28.959 --> 21:31.209
Wedgie!

21:31.209 --> 21:33.125
Move in.
We need to get this moved

21:33.125 --> 21:34.542
so we can bring
the NautiBuoys in.

21:34.542 --> 21:35.751
I'll go get my blacks.

21:35.751 --> 21:37.375
-How was it?
-Hard, hard work.

21:37.375 --> 21:39.542
Rayna, we'll just
get all this stuff off the deck

21:39.542 --> 21:43.834
as quick as we can.

21:43.834 --> 21:48.125
God, what a hot mess.

21:48.125 --> 21:49.584
How's your shoulder?

21:49.584 --> 21:51.000
Yeah, it's all right.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.626
Rayna, can you be
a bit quicker, please?

21:53.626 --> 21:55.042
I'm... yeah, I'm trying to...

21:55.042 --> 21:56.250
You're just walking around,
whistling.

21:56.250 --> 21:58.083
-No, I'm not.
-Like, this isn't...

21:58.083 --> 21:59.876
We're not... we're not...
we're not chilling.

21:59.876 --> 22:01.209
I'm bringing all the dishes
to the galley.

22:01.209 --> 22:03.083
No, you're not pulling
you're weight.

22:03.083 --> 22:04.042
That's not...
that's what you're doing.

22:04.042 --> 22:05.834
-That is not true,
-It is true.

22:05.834 --> 22:07.250
That's not true.
Do not talk to me like...

22:07.250 --> 22:08.959
Oh, you've brought five bags,
oh, that's nice.

22:08.959 --> 22:10.709
Rethink the way
you talk to me.

22:10.709 --> 22:12.000
Because I swear to God,
you're...

22:12.000 --> 22:15.042
I'm not the one.
Rethink that.

22:15.042 --> 22:16.542
You need to start
pulling your weight.

22:16.542 --> 22:18.334
Who the [bleep]
are you talking to,

22:18.334 --> 22:30.167
like, you know what I'm saying?
Like, calm down.

22:30.167 --> 22:31.334
Coming up...

22:31.334 --> 22:32.542
Make sure they're ready to go.

22:32.542 --> 22:33.709
I don't need any [bleep] ups.

22:33.709 --> 22:35.209
This sh-- needs to be secured!

22:35.209 --> 22:36.125
[bleep] me.

22:36.125 --> 22:37.375
Seems like something's
going on.

22:37.375 --> 22:37.375
Mother----er.

22:37.375 --> 22:47.501
[bleep]
oh, no...

22:47.501 --> 22:49.751
That luau was cool.

22:49.751 --> 22:51.375
Probably some of the best
eating I've had in a while.

22:51.375 --> 22:54.083
So glad that the guests
are still full from the luau.

22:54.083 --> 22:57.000
Welcome to the newest
trend of 2021...

22:57.000 --> 22:58.167
linner!

22:58.167 --> 22:59.334
Lunch and dinner...

22:59.334 --> 23:01.584
you jam it into one and
you go to bed early.

23:01.584 --> 23:04.626
It's great.

23:04.626 --> 23:06.209
How are you feeling?

23:06.209 --> 23:08.250
I would just be happy if
the boat would stop swaying.

23:08.250 --> 23:09.292
Yeah?

23:09.292 --> 23:12.626
I keep just trying to sing
to myself, you know?

23:12.626 --> 23:14.876
Everyone needs
a coping mechanism.

23:14.876 --> 23:15.959
Ah.

23:15.959 --> 23:17.083
I'm really proud of my team.

23:17.083 --> 23:18.542
They killed it today.

23:18.542 --> 23:21.292
I like the fact that Jake
pays attention and he listens.

23:21.292 --> 23:25.959
So, I'm leaning towards
we made the right call.

23:25.959 --> 23:27.709
Called it.

23:27.709 --> 23:28.709
Boop.

23:28.709 --> 23:30.918
I think so.

23:30.918 --> 23:32.709
I want a shower.
My nose hurts.

23:32.709 --> 23:38.375
-Go for it.
-Aye-aye.

23:38.375 --> 23:39.834
You better.

23:39.834 --> 23:40.834
We good?

23:40.834 --> 23:42.125
Crazy as [bleep].

23:42.125 --> 23:43.792
-It's crazy, huh?
-You are.

23:43.792 --> 23:45.959
It wouldn't be the first time
somebody's called me crazy.

23:45.959 --> 23:47.125
I can't switch off.

23:47.125 --> 23:48.542
I get just get into
that mentality of...

23:48.542 --> 23:50.083
Yeah, you get into...

23:50.083 --> 23:52.000
get the ----ing sh-- done
as quick as you can.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.375
Maybe you're not seeing it,

23:53.375 --> 23:54.751
but today was, like,
really hard for me.

23:54.751 --> 23:56.417
Yeah.

23:56.417 --> 23:58.167
I cried earlier, because it's
like, I don't have an attitude.

23:58.167 --> 24:00.125
Like, I'm just...
I'm not happy all the time.

24:00.125 --> 24:01.834
Well, we got there
in the end, and now...

24:01.834 --> 24:03.125
Thank God.

24:03.125 --> 24:09.792
Now we're all good.

24:09.792 --> 24:11.167
Why don't you knock
off 20 minutes early

24:11.167 --> 24:12.209
and go get some rest?

24:12.209 --> 24:13.792
We can handle it
from here, yeah?

24:13.792 --> 24:16.250
-Thank you.
-Of course, always.

24:16.250 --> 24:17.792
Are you guys staying
up for a while?

24:17.792 --> 24:19.125
-A little bit.
-Good, enjoy it.

24:19.125 --> 24:21.125
We've only been up
since 5:30, so...

24:21.125 --> 24:22.042
I'm sure you can't
relate at all.

24:22.042 --> 24:23.417
I have no idea what that's like.

24:23.417 --> 24:26.792
Yeah.

24:26.792 --> 24:30.959
How does this look for you?

24:30.959 --> 24:36.542
I milk, milk, milkie!

24:36.542 --> 24:38.042
-You good?
-Yeah.

24:38.042 --> 24:39.292
What's wrong?

24:39.292 --> 24:40.167
Nothing.

24:40.167 --> 24:42.292
I'm gonna keep bugging
you about it.

24:42.292 --> 24:43.959
It's nothing, I don't wanna
get anyone in trouble.

24:43.959 --> 24:45.125
You're not gonna get
anyone in trouble.

24:45.125 --> 24:46.417
Jake is just, like...

24:46.417 --> 24:48.042
his just, delivery's
not so good.

24:48.042 --> 24:49.292
Can you give me an example?

24:49.292 --> 24:51.292
He told me, like,
"You just move too slow."

24:51.292 --> 24:53.209
"Like, you don't pull your
weight on this team."

24:53.209 --> 24:55.209
Like, he's just,
like, really going in.

24:55.209 --> 24:57.000
I can understand how
that can be hurtful.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.167
I talked him, like, eventually,
and I was just kinda, like...

24:59.167 --> 25:00.792
-Yeah, and everything's good?
-Yeah, everything's fine.

25:00.792 --> 25:02.125
You're good?

25:02.125 --> 25:03.417
Like, you can, like, speak
respectfully outside

25:03.417 --> 25:05.334
of cussing at me
and yelling at me.

25:05.334 --> 25:07.209
Because, like, I'm not gonna
receive that correctly.

25:07.209 --> 25:10.000
Okay, but at the same time,
you need to remember

25:10.000 --> 25:12.167
that he is
the lead deckhand now,

25:12.167 --> 25:14.459
so you gotta take
that role seriously.

25:14.459 --> 25:18.292
Maybe you should try
to absorb some of it.

25:18.292 --> 25:20.792
Remember, he's just getting
into this role right now.

25:20.792 --> 25:22.209
Yeah.

25:22.209 --> 25:23.584
And he's doing a really,
really good job.

25:23.584 --> 25:26.250
The way Jake acts towards me,
if I told my officer

25:26.250 --> 25:29.125
that on my last boat, he'd be
like, "Tell him to [bleep] off,

25:29.125 --> 25:30.334
and next time,
come talk to me."

25:30.334 --> 25:34.125
It was very, like,
in an aggressive, like...

25:34.125 --> 25:36.959
Yeah, well, this is
kind of aggressive.

25:36.959 --> 25:38.417
Yeah.

25:38.417 --> 25:39.834
This is an aggressive season
that we're in, okay?

25:39.834 --> 25:41.501
-Yeah.
-Okay, cool.

25:41.501 --> 25:42.250
You did a good job today.

25:42.250 --> 25:44.876
-Thank you so much.
-No problem.

25:44.876 --> 25:46.709
[sighs]

25:46.709 --> 25:47.709
I'm off to bed.

25:47.709 --> 25:48.876
-Shall we?
-We shall.

25:48.876 --> 25:50.209
Have a gorgeous evening.

25:50.209 --> 25:53.959
You as well, get some sleep.

25:53.959 --> 25:55.584
Cat person or dog person?

25:55.584 --> 25:57.501
I have a cat, but...

25:57.501 --> 25:58.501
Night, bro.

25:58.501 --> 25:59.292
I like both.

25:59.292 --> 26:02.209
I think I was a cat
in another life,

26:02.209 --> 26:09.000
because I could just lie around.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.417
I don't not like Wes.

26:10.417 --> 26:13.792
Wes is just a good,
down-to-Earth person.

26:13.792 --> 26:17.417
I just... I'm...

26:17.417 --> 26:20.542
I was basically in
quarantine for, like, a year,

26:20.542 --> 26:23.167
where I just, like,
lived in my robe for days.

26:23.167 --> 26:26.209
Yeah, let's go back to that.

26:26.209 --> 26:28.792
During the daytime, I say
I hate my ----ing life.

26:28.792 --> 26:34.292
This is kicking my ass.

26:34.292 --> 26:36.083
You're gonna be on
at 6:30, right?

26:36.083 --> 26:37.042
Abso-tutely.

26:37.042 --> 26:42.626
I'm 6:00, woo!

26:42.626 --> 26:53.918
What's happening now?

26:53.918 --> 26:56.709
[whistling]

26:56.709 --> 26:58.250
Lucy, I'm home.

26:58.250 --> 27:01.209
-Good night.
-See you in the morning.

27:01.209 --> 27:13.459
Jesus, it's cold in here.

27:13.459 --> 27:29.667
Oh [bleep].

27:29.667 --> 27:31.000
Cheers, good morning.

27:31.000 --> 27:32.709
-Oh, morning.
-Thank you so much.

27:32.709 --> 27:34.125
-You are so welcome.
-How are you this morning?

27:34.125 --> 27:35.417
I'm doing very well, thank you.

27:35.417 --> 27:37.584
Just gonna give you
----ing crab.

27:37.584 --> 27:39.751
-Ready to hoist.
-Let's get outta here.

27:39.751 --> 27:41.167
Long stay, 12:00.

27:41.167 --> 27:44.042
All right, I'm plating now.

27:44.042 --> 27:45.709
Anchor's home, locking it in.

27:45.709 --> 27:46.667
We're outta here.

27:46.667 --> 27:47.709
Ready?

27:47.709 --> 27:48.709
This can go.

27:48.709 --> 27:50.167
This is stone crab claws?

27:50.167 --> 27:51.209
Yes, and then after
that is the king crab.

27:51.209 --> 27:52.501
Beautiful.

27:52.501 --> 27:56.083
So, today for breakfast
I've decided to do king crab,

27:56.083 --> 27:58.334
snow crab,
and huevos rancheros.

27:58.334 --> 28:01.042
Here you are, I'm just gonna
keep bringing it up, okay?

28:01.042 --> 28:03.250
It's like, let's bump up,
bump up, bump up the tip,

28:03.250 --> 28:06.000
bump up the tip, just the tip.

28:06.000 --> 28:09.000
I'm gonna garnish, and
these will be ready to rock.

28:09.000 --> 28:10.125
Oh, my... yep.

28:10.125 --> 28:11.792
That's so good.

28:11.792 --> 28:15.000
-Wow, she's so clear here.
-Swear to God.

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
Look at that.

28:16.000 --> 28:17.042
Oh, that's gorg.

28:17.042 --> 28:18.626
Yeah.

28:18.626 --> 28:20.083
You guys ready on deck?

28:20.083 --> 28:21.542
----ing hell.

28:21.542 --> 28:22.918
-Are we ready?
-No, we're not.

28:22.918 --> 28:25.584
-Not yet.
-One minute.

28:25.584 --> 28:29.167
Let's get it done, I'm a
thousand yards from the markers.

28:29.167 --> 28:31.125
-Can you get that fender pumped?
-Yep.

28:31.125 --> 28:33.834
Make sure they're ready to go.
I don't need any [bleep] ups.

28:33.834 --> 28:35.000
Yes, sir.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
All right, let me help you
out quick here.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.042
Chuck that.

28:38.042 --> 28:39.375
What do you guys need to do?

28:39.375 --> 28:40.626
Just get this heaving
line through.

28:40.626 --> 28:42.292
What about fenders?

28:42.292 --> 28:46.751
There needs to be a fender right
here, that big boy, that's it.

28:46.751 --> 28:49.083
This fender will just have
to be tied on the railing.

28:49.083 --> 28:50.334
Yes, yeah, yeah, I know,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:50.334 --> 28:51.834
-Tie it off.
-Thank you, though.

28:51.834 --> 28:53.000
Right here.

28:53.000 --> 28:54.459
Three, two, one.

28:54.459 --> 28:56.417
This sh-- needs to be
secured, seriously.

28:56.417 --> 28:58.876
All right, we can get
fenders over once we go

28:58.876 --> 29:00.083
past over here.

29:00.083 --> 29:02.125
When you tie your fender,
secure it as well,

29:02.125 --> 29:03.501
in case it does blow off.

29:03.501 --> 29:06.876
I need radio silence
from here on out.

29:06.876 --> 29:12.459
Go ahead and drop fenders.

29:12.459 --> 29:16.083
Oh, man, we lost the cover.

29:16.083 --> 29:17.250
Fender cover's lost.

29:17.250 --> 29:19.000
It seems like
something's going on.

29:19.000 --> 29:20.209
What happened to the fender?

29:20.209 --> 29:20.209
-Not secured.
-Jesus Christ.

29:20.209 --> 29:25.501
That luau was cool.

29:25.501 --> 29:30.000
Go ahead and drop fenders.

29:30.000 --> 29:33.209
Oh, man, we lost the cover.

29:33.209 --> 29:34.375
What happened to the fender?

29:34.375 --> 29:36.792
-Fender cover's lost.
-Mother----er.

29:36.792 --> 29:39.000
If you don't see the
fender cover is secured,

29:39.000 --> 29:41.209
well, then secure it first.

29:41.209 --> 29:42.792
Need to be checking these
things, people,

29:42.792 --> 29:44.167
and that means everyone.

29:44.167 --> 29:45.167
Sorry about that, Cap,
won't happen again.

29:45.167 --> 29:46.584
This is frustrating.

29:46.584 --> 29:48.209
It's little things
like that show

29:48.209 --> 29:50.375
Wes's inexperience
on a mega-yacht.

29:50.375 --> 29:52.626
Somewhere, Captain Lee
is cussing up a storm right now.

29:52.626 --> 29:55.417
Can't even get the ----ing
Goddamn fenders out.

29:55.417 --> 29:58.542
Sixty-five feet off flush
bow to stern.

29:58.542 --> 30:00.292
I'm gonna go start
packing, then.

30:00.292 --> 30:02.083
Holding about 15 feet.

30:02.083 --> 30:03.918
Let's get the lines out.

30:03.918 --> 30:07.125
-Lines out.
-Lines.

30:07.125 --> 30:08.083
Let's take up on
these bow lines.

30:08.083 --> 30:09.709
-Copy.
-Tighten it up.

30:09.709 --> 30:10.959
We all locked in?

30:10.959 --> 30:12.209
Locked in!

30:12.209 --> 30:13.083
Okay, that works.

30:13.083 --> 30:14.792
[bleep] me.

30:14.792 --> 30:16.501
One more cocktail?

30:16.501 --> 30:18.417
I'd like to see who's gonna tear
me off of this ----ing thing.

30:18.417 --> 30:20.209
Attention all crew,
attention all crew.

30:20.209 --> 30:26.042
I need everybody in their whites
for guest departure, please.

30:26.042 --> 30:28.375
Ow!
[bleep] my life!

30:28.375 --> 30:31.667
I ----ing put my earring
through the cut in my finger!

30:31.667 --> 30:35.209
Ah!

30:35.209 --> 30:37.626
All good things must come
to an end.

30:37.626 --> 30:39.417
Oh! Yeah, I know.

30:39.417 --> 30:40.417
Thank you so much.

30:40.417 --> 30:42.042
You're welcome, my pleasure.

30:42.042 --> 30:43.375
-The food was incredible.
-See you later.

30:43.375 --> 30:45.083
Thank you again, and I am
sorry for my actions.

30:45.083 --> 30:46.584
-No, that's all right.
-I really appreciate it.

30:46.584 --> 30:49.501
I appreciate everybody
being so patient with us

30:49.501 --> 30:50.959
on the first night.

30:50.959 --> 30:53.000
The pig roast was awesome,

30:53.000 --> 30:57.000
and in our appreciation,
I have this for you all.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.167
Thank you.

30:58.167 --> 31:00.125
-Cheers, you guys.
-Be well.

31:00.125 --> 31:01.626
Let's go, pitter-patter.

31:01.626 --> 31:03.125
We can all say it
together now...

31:03.125 --> 31:04.542
[bleep] off.

31:04.542 --> 31:05.959
Boy, am I glad that's over.

31:05.959 --> 31:07.250
Let's get that garbage.

31:07.250 --> 31:09.083
Jess, if you wanna
strip the beds.

31:09.083 --> 31:10.501
Fraser, if you wanna grab all
the trash from all the rooms.

31:10.501 --> 31:13.209
Yes, ma'am.

31:13.209 --> 31:15.000
♪ I need a drying rag

31:15.000 --> 31:17.292
♪ Because you are a hag

31:17.292 --> 31:19.125
-Hey, you.
-Hey, babe.

31:19.125 --> 31:20.501
Hey, fancy meeting you here.

31:20.501 --> 31:22.459
Yeah.

31:22.459 --> 31:25.125
Eew.

31:25.125 --> 31:26.375
Attention all crew,

31:26.375 --> 31:28.959
I need everyone in the
crew mess immediately.

31:28.959 --> 31:30.125
Deck team copies.

31:30.125 --> 31:38.959
Rachel and Fraser copy.

31:38.959 --> 31:40.626
Mm.

31:40.626 --> 31:44.000
Overall, I think the charter
went pretty good,

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
forgive the first night.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.375
But I think this
morning's docking...

31:48.375 --> 31:52.667
you guys didn't
look really coordinated.

31:52.667 --> 31:55.250
The fenders... we need to
pay more attention to that.

31:55.250 --> 31:57.167
Yeah, we'll work on that.

31:57.167 --> 31:59.000
Remember that everything
needs to be secured.

31:59.000 --> 32:02.083
It is not acceptable to have
things sliding overboard.

32:02.083 --> 32:03.792
It's really embarrassing
to have a crew

32:03.792 --> 32:06.125
that's not really paying
attention to the little details.

32:06.125 --> 32:08.334
The fender covers might
not be expensive,

32:08.334 --> 32:09.959
but this is a mega-yacht,

32:09.959 --> 32:11.667
and they need to get
their sh-- together.

32:11.667 --> 32:16.417
But other than that, I think
everybody performed well.

32:16.417 --> 32:17.918
Nineteen thousand,
eight hundred.

32:17.918 --> 32:19.125
Whoa!

32:19.125 --> 32:21.626
So, that's 1,650 each.

32:21.626 --> 32:22.626
Awesome.

32:22.626 --> 32:24.459
You deserve to go out
and celebrate tonight.

32:24.459 --> 32:26.083
You can tell Heather to
go [bleep] herself any time

32:26.083 --> 32:28.792
if it leads to a $20,000 tip.

32:28.792 --> 32:30.542
-Bye, Captain!
-Thanks, Captain Lee.

32:30.542 --> 32:31.417
Thank you.

32:31.417 --> 32:33.125
See you later,
guys, you're welcome.

32:33.125 --> 32:38.125
Get back to work.

32:38.125 --> 32:42.459
Drying is so mind-numbing.

32:42.459 --> 32:45.209
Okay, it's time for a beer.

32:45.209 --> 32:47.209
Fraser, Jess,
both of you go down.

32:47.209 --> 32:49.209
Eddie, how long have you
worked with Captain Lee?

32:49.209 --> 32:52.000
This is my fifth year
working with Captain Lee.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.584
What's the worst thing you've
done to piss him off?

32:54.584 --> 32:56.167
The worst mistake
I probably ever made

32:56.167 --> 32:59.584
was I slept with a stew
in the laundry room.

32:59.584 --> 33:03.876
Ah!

33:03.876 --> 33:06.626
He wasn't angry with me,
he was just disappointed.

33:06.626 --> 33:08.792
You got your dirty laundry
aired but good.

33:08.792 --> 33:11.834
Don't mind telling you,
I expected more.

33:11.834 --> 33:13.542
And then I had a girlfriend
back home at the time.

33:13.542 --> 33:14.959
No!

33:14.959 --> 33:16.334
Yeah, I ----ed up.

33:16.334 --> 33:17.751
I was embarrassed about myself,

33:17.751 --> 33:19.918
I destroyed a
----ing relationship that,

33:19.918 --> 33:21.042
like, I really cared about.

33:21.042 --> 33:22.042
So, I took five years off.

33:22.042 --> 33:23.000
Really?

33:23.000 --> 33:24.501
Yachting is not
for relationships.

33:24.501 --> 33:26.709
No... well, I mean, it can be.

33:26.709 --> 33:27.417
Yeah.

33:27.417 --> 33:30.250
I'm gonna go pop
in the shower.

33:30.250 --> 33:35.876
I need lotion,
'cause I am dry and ashy,

33:35.876 --> 33:41.959
I do not like that, no.

33:41.959 --> 33:45.042
Party shirt.

33:45.042 --> 33:47.000
Ready to rumble.

33:47.000 --> 33:49.459
Oh, my God,
my face was right there.

33:49.459 --> 33:52.209
Oh, my God.

33:52.209 --> 33:55.167
Do we know how old Heather is?

33:55.167 --> 33:56.167
What do you guys reckon?

33:56.167 --> 33:57.209
Thirty-two.

33:57.209 --> 33:59.542
Thirty-two, 33, 34, 35.

33:59.542 --> 34:00.834
I hope so.

34:00.834 --> 34:02.626
Imagine we find out she's,
like, 10 years younger than us,

34:02.626 --> 34:04.125
and I've just
been bossed around by a child

34:04.125 --> 34:07.042
-for the past two weeks.
-No, she's not.

34:07.042 --> 34:10.292
I'd be ----ing furious.

34:10.292 --> 34:12.000
-Get out!
-I'm going!

34:12.000 --> 34:13.250
Woo!

34:13.250 --> 34:15.000
I'm gonna freeze my tits off.

34:15.000 --> 34:17.209
This place is awesome.

34:17.209 --> 34:18.459
Isn't this beautiful?

34:18.459 --> 34:19.751
This is so nice!

34:19.751 --> 34:21.876
[chattering]

34:21.876 --> 34:24.042
I'm just gonna have
the vegan penne pasta.

34:24.042 --> 34:27.292
The Australian lamb chops.

34:27.292 --> 34:30.042
Mussels and a ribeye...
say no more.

34:30.042 --> 34:31.501
Can I see the Jenga?

34:31.501 --> 34:35.042
Can you pass that to me, please?

34:35.042 --> 34:38.209
[bleep] me,
I'm actually kinda scared.

34:38.209 --> 34:39.501
Truth...

34:39.501 --> 34:42.876
have you ever peed
in a hot tub,

34:42.876 --> 34:45.834
dot, dot, dot, recently.

34:45.834 --> 34:48.125
I have not.

34:48.125 --> 34:49.125
Thank you.

34:49.125 --> 34:50.334
This is delicious.

34:50.334 --> 34:54.417
Jessica, what's in
your bedside drawer?

34:54.417 --> 34:59.834
Oh, God, I do not wanna know.

34:59.834 --> 35:03.000
Candy? Good for you!

35:03.000 --> 35:05.542
This is so sad.

35:05.542 --> 35:09.250
Truth... have you ever made
out with someone here?

35:09.250 --> 35:10.375
I'm gonna say no.

35:10.375 --> 35:11.584
Don't pick another one.

35:11.584 --> 35:12.918
Is that...

35:12.918 --> 35:14.751
Just tell us who you would like
to make out with at the table.

35:14.751 --> 35:17.000
-Oh!
-Woo!

35:17.000 --> 35:18.083
Yes!

35:18.083 --> 35:23.042
If I have to choose...

35:23.042 --> 35:24.626
Just say it!

35:24.626 --> 35:25.667
Jess, Jess, Jess!

35:25.667 --> 35:27.834
-It's Jess!
-It's Jess!

35:27.834 --> 35:30.959
Woo!

35:30.959 --> 35:33.918
I could show him
a thing or two.

35:33.918 --> 35:34.918
What's your dare?

35:34.918 --> 35:36.083
Give someone a lap dance.

35:36.083 --> 35:40.000
Make it happen.

35:40.000 --> 35:41.709
Here we go!

35:41.709 --> 35:44.209
[shouting]

35:44.209 --> 35:45.709
Bring it back here.

35:45.709 --> 35:46.918
Can I touch?

35:46.918 --> 35:48.501
Woo, I'm touching!

35:48.501 --> 35:49.918
Oh, Goddamn!

35:49.918 --> 35:53.959
Ah!

35:53.959 --> 35:54.959
----ing hell!

35:54.959 --> 35:57.083
Too much!
Too much!

35:57.083 --> 35:59.751
I'll be ready for
you next time, Jake.

35:59.751 --> 36:01.083
You just manhandled me.

36:01.083 --> 36:05.083
No wonder
why he's lead deckhand!

36:05.083 --> 36:06.918
Coming up...

36:06.918 --> 36:13.083
-Ah!
-Ah!

36:13.083 --> 36:16.209
No way! No way!

36:16.209 --> 36:18.167
What? Whoa!

36:18.167 --> 36:26.375
Oh!

36:26.375 --> 36:29.083
I saw that!

36:29.083 --> 36:30.209
All right.

36:30.209 --> 36:33.125
Oh, wow.

36:33.125 --> 36:39.209
That'll warm you up.

36:39.209 --> 36:47.292
You're so funny,
and the fact that...

36:47.292 --> 36:50.042
What do you mean,
there's plenty of choice.

36:50.042 --> 36:51.459
There's no choice.

36:51.459 --> 36:52.959
Oh, are you gay, then?

36:52.959 --> 36:57.125
Yeah, just need to find
a guest, I guess.

36:57.125 --> 36:59.459
I'm so shocked that
it's taken Jake this long

36:59.459 --> 37:05.125
to piece that together.

37:05.125 --> 37:07.167
Ah, bless him.

37:07.167 --> 37:08.375
Boys and girls, are you ready?

37:08.375 --> 37:10.834
Skiddly-diddly.

37:10.834 --> 37:13.209
-Ugh!
-Get your ass in this car!

37:13.209 --> 37:14.167
Get the [bleep] in!

37:14.167 --> 37:15.834
Everybody wants a
piece of Fraser.

37:15.834 --> 37:17.417
How does it feel to be wanted?

37:17.417 --> 37:19.918
[American accent] Like, real
good. Like, super good.

37:19.918 --> 37:21.626
-But, like, I don't--
-Super [bleep]...

37:21.626 --> 37:23.209
Hold on, drop the American!

37:23.209 --> 37:24.542
I'm super worried
about the fact that, like,

37:24.542 --> 37:26.792
I've left my friend back
in the car.

37:26.792 --> 37:30.918
That was good.
That was good.

37:30.918 --> 37:32.709
-We're here.
-Hot tub.

37:32.709 --> 37:36.000
We're getting that
mother----in' hot tub.

37:36.000 --> 37:37.417
Ugh.

37:37.417 --> 37:38.834
Get the [bleep] outta here.

37:38.834 --> 37:40.000
Are we going in the hot tub?

37:40.000 --> 37:46.334
-I don't know.
-Don't lie to me.

37:46.334 --> 37:48.334
You like that?

37:48.334 --> 37:51.209
Oh, no, the guests' socks.

37:51.209 --> 37:54.375
Whoops.

37:54.375 --> 37:55.501
This feels great.

37:55.501 --> 37:57.751
-Eddie!
-Oh, my God.

37:57.751 --> 38:01.876
It's a party you heathen
son of a bitches.

38:01.876 --> 38:04.292
Yeah!

38:04.292 --> 38:17.709
Ah!

38:17.709 --> 38:20.209
And that is how
you ----ing exit.

38:20.209 --> 38:22.167
Yeah!

38:22.167 --> 38:26.334
Ah!

38:26.334 --> 38:30.667
Ah!

38:30.667 --> 38:36.584
All right,
good night, everybody.

38:36.584 --> 38:38.083
Where the hell is Eddie going?

38:38.083 --> 38:45.334
Whew.

38:45.334 --> 38:46.918
Oh, my God.

38:46.918 --> 38:50.209
I need a shower and
a glass of champagne,

38:50.209 --> 38:53.000
but I have a feeling that's not
gonna be on offer this evening.

38:53.000 --> 38:54.876
[phone rings]

38:54.876 --> 38:57.125
Hey, sweetheart,
how you doing?

38:57.125 --> 38:58.709
I'm good.

38:58.709 --> 39:22.000
Ah!

39:22.000 --> 39:24.542
I need a girlfriend
that lets you

39:24.542 --> 39:27.626
disappear for
couple months on end.

39:27.626 --> 39:35.334
It's not easy.

39:35.334 --> 39:36.626
So, it's great, yeah.

39:36.626 --> 39:41.876
And she's handling it well also.

39:41.876 --> 39:45.459
----ing lies.

39:45.459 --> 40:00.542
No comment.

40:00.542 --> 40:09.042
Does anybody handle this
sh-- well?

40:09.042 --> 40:11.167
[shouting]

40:11.167 --> 40:13.167
Ah!

40:13.167 --> 40:26.959
Ow!

40:26.959 --> 40:30.250
No way, no way, ah!

40:30.250 --> 40:32.542
What? Whoa!

40:32.542 --> 40:33.792
Oh!

40:33.792 --> 40:36.083
This Rayna-Jake thing
is gonna be, like,

40:36.083 --> 40:38.042
a ----ing roller coaster.

40:38.042 --> 40:39.959
Now Fraser's included.

40:39.959 --> 40:41.375
Ah, this could get messy.

40:41.375 --> 40:43.834
Well, I am going to B-E-D.

40:43.834 --> 40:44.667
Okay.

40:44.667 --> 40:53.292
Good night, guys, I'm out.

40:53.292 --> 40:56.667
Yeah.

40:56.667 --> 41:03.209
-I'm done.
-Catch you on the flip side.

41:03.209 --> 41:10.042
Lord, help me.

41:10.042 --> 41:11.542
Mm.

41:11.542 --> 41:13.042
Rayna, can you put a muffin
in for us, please?

41:13.042 --> 41:14.751
Do I look like
the ----ing muffin man?

41:14.751 --> 41:21.167
No. No!

41:21.167 --> 41:32.209
Up top.

41:32.209 --> 41:36.167
You can stay there.

41:36.167 --> 41:37.626
You're engaged?

41:37.626 --> 41:41.000
-Well, technically.
-You didn't tell me that.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.459
I cannot believe any of this.
You're a ----ing liar.

41:43.459 --> 41:47.209
What the [bleep] do you mean
that you're engaged?

41:47.209 --> 41:49.042
You stuck your tongue
down my throat,

41:49.042 --> 41:50.042
and you don't wanna say nothing?

41:50.042 --> 41:52.083
I feel like a ----ing idiot.

41:52.083 --> 42:05.584
It's complete bullsh--.

42:05.584 --> 42:06.918
I mean, this is
the classic example

42:06.918 --> 42:09.125
of why you don't
do crew romances.

42:09.125 --> 42:20.125
It's just gonna be
an absolute disaster.

42:20.125 --> 42:22.167
Next on "Below Deck"...

42:22.167 --> 42:23.292
Hello!

42:23.292 --> 42:25.918
The kid has a case
handcuffed to his wrist.

42:25.918 --> 42:29.751
Five-star service...
and a nanny.

42:29.751 --> 42:31.918
Hi, my pleasure.

42:31.918 --> 42:32.959
Ugh.

42:32.959 --> 42:35.167
Am I following you to your...
oh, I'm going...

42:35.167 --> 42:37.125
-No, your room's down there.
-Mine's down there?

42:37.125 --> 42:39.000
Okay.

42:39.000 --> 42:40.250
She was gonna follow me in here.

42:40.250 --> 42:41.375
Love that guy.

42:41.375 --> 42:44.000
Laugh it up, funny boy.

42:44.000 --> 42:47.459
Jess, she's just, like, moping
around as if, like, pure misery.

42:47.459 --> 42:49.334
I just don't feel like
she wants to be here,

42:49.334 --> 42:53.709
and I'm not gonna keep
trying to pull her up.

42:53.709 --> 42:54.959
Cushions, cushions, cushions.

42:54.959 --> 42:56.000
[bleep]

42:56.000 --> 42:57.876
I'm just so ----ing frustrated.

42:57.876 --> 43:00.000
I want things covered, I don't
want another ----ing thing

43:00.000 --> 43:02.209
falling off this boat, copy?

43:02.209 --> 43:06.209
That's ----ing bullsh--.
