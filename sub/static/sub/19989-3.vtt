WEBVTT

00:03.100 --> 00:05.830
Sorry to trouble you at home Ma'am, but
we've just picked up a bystander triple-9

00:05.880 --> 00:09.090
on an active abduction of a young
female in the Moss Heath area.

00:09.140 --> 00:12.070
Been looking for him for months.
We'll get this bastard, yeah?

00:13.620 --> 00:16.329
Michael Farmer, I'm arresting
you on suspicion of abduction

00:16.379 --> 00:17.970
and attempted murder.

00:18.020 --> 00:19.290
Is this you, Michael?

00:19.340 --> 00:21.540
The 24-year-old man has been charged.

00:23.540 --> 00:25.050
There's a young boy might go to prison

00:25.100 --> 00:26.530
because of a crime he didn't commit.

00:26.580 --> 00:28.170
Huntley's definitely hiding something

00:28.220 --> 00:30.010
about how the case against
Farmer was handled.

00:30.060 --> 00:31.090
What, I don't know.

00:31.140 --> 00:34.240
No. There's the man you should
be looking for up there.

00:36.620 --> 00:37.770
New gaffer's ready.

00:37.820 --> 00:40.690
For those who don't know
me, I'm DCI Ian Buckells.

00:40.740 --> 00:42.450
I'm now running Operation Trapdoor.

00:42.500 --> 00:45.090
I do not want to pull
my officer off this job.

00:45.140 --> 00:47.900
The world and his wife
would know who's to blame.

00:50.500 --> 00:52.450
That's me, sir, if you're interested.

00:52.500 --> 00:55.060
Don't leave before you
make an appointment.

00:57.580 --> 00:58.610
You all right?

00:58.660 --> 01:00.340
I need to go back to work.

01:06.740 --> 01:08.370
What have you got against Michael Farmer,

01:08.420 --> 01:11.320
except him being retarded
enough for you to frame?!

01:13.000 --> 01:19.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:27.740 --> 01:29.770
Fingertips were amputated postmortem.

01:29.820 --> 01:32.730
So we're surmising that Tim tried
to grab a handful of his assailant.

01:32.780 --> 01:36.700
A swab of worktop blood
spatter. Item Reference KRG-13.

01:45.340 --> 01:49.490
A trace of foreign DNA was found on
Leonie Collersdale's partial torso.

01:49.540 --> 01:51.820
It matches to Tim Ifield.

01:58.740 --> 02:00.340
Team briefing, one minute.

02:05.020 --> 02:06.210
Team briefing.

02:06.260 --> 02:07.490
Office or meeting room, boss?

02:07.540 --> 02:08.970
Incident Room.

02:09.020 --> 02:11.930
I've been thinking we should
appeal for more witnesses

02:11.980 --> 02:13.210
in the Michael Farmer case.

02:13.260 --> 02:14.370
As he's been charged,

02:14.420 --> 02:16.930
perhaps they've decided it's
not necessary coming forward...

02:16.980 --> 02:18.330
Um, sorry...?

02:18.380 --> 02:21.090
Ah, Ian, join us. Joint team briefing.

02:21.140 --> 02:24.010
Operation Trapdoor and
Tim Ifield's murder.

02:24.060 --> 02:25.890
I'm not being funny,
Roz, but what you up to?

02:25.940 --> 02:28.250
I've cleared this with Assistant
Chief Constable Hilton.

02:28.300 --> 02:30.540
- Well, no-one said a word to me.
- Sorry.

02:33.540 --> 02:36.770
Kate. I've promised ACC
Hilton complete discretion.

02:36.820 --> 02:38.170
I don't want him being embarrassed

02:38.220 --> 02:40.520
by any of this getting back to East Mids.

02:46.660 --> 02:50.850
Op Trapdoor -- although
Michael Farmer's been charged,

02:50.900 --> 02:53.570
we're still dealing with
recent developments...

02:53.620 --> 02:54.820
Just there, guys.

02:56.340 --> 02:59.050
.. namely the finding of body parts

02:59.100 --> 03:02.900
that have been matched to our
second victim, Leonie Collersdale.

03:08.620 --> 03:11.320
I cannot emphasise confidentiality enough.

03:13.140 --> 03:15.890
You are not to discuss
outside of this inquiry

03:15.940 --> 03:20.330
that Leonie Collersdale's body parts
bore traces of Tim Ifield's DNA.

03:20.380 --> 03:22.570
We've never found any
connection in the phone records

03:22.620 --> 03:25.090
between Tim Ifield and Leonie Collersdale.

03:25.140 --> 03:28.770
So we're looking for one
between Tim and Michael Farmer.

03:28.820 --> 03:30.170
Maybe they were accomplices.

03:30.220 --> 03:33.090
Or maybe Farmer had nothing to do
with Leonie Collersdale's murder,

03:33.140 --> 03:34.490
despite being charged with it.

03:34.540 --> 03:36.490
Ian, there's mountains of evidence.

03:36.540 --> 03:40.330
Ma'am, I've been running a check
on the tools found in the flat.

03:40.380 --> 03:42.090
May I? Sorry.

03:42.140 --> 03:43.980
No, please. Thank you, Jodie.

03:45.180 --> 03:47.330
They appeared brand-new. The tools.

03:47.380 --> 03:51.170
So I've been looking into recent
purchases in the local area...

03:51.220 --> 03:54.580
and I found this on CCTV...

03:55.900 --> 03:57.800
.. from the night of Tim's murder.

04:06.820 --> 04:08.610
Sir.

04:08.660 --> 04:09.890
God's sake, I'm busting.

04:09.940 --> 04:11.410
Tie a knot in it.

04:11.460 --> 04:12.730
What went on in there?

04:12.780 --> 04:15.170
Since when's it my job to do yours?

04:15.220 --> 04:16.810
If you put the report
on my desk, DS Flynn,

04:16.860 --> 04:18.209
I'll be sure to take a look at it.

04:18.260 --> 04:20.170
Don't do that, sir. You sound like a dick.

04:20.220 --> 04:23.330
Yeah, well, this dick's no
grass for AC-12 -- he's a DCI,

04:23.380 --> 04:25.210
and I didn't get there
by sticking my neck out.

04:25.260 --> 04:27.650
I got there by letting the other buggers.

04:27.700 --> 04:29.700
Maybe that's why you're still a DS.

04:31.820 --> 04:33.250
Well, I wish I could shed more light,

04:33.300 --> 04:34.650
but I'm a bit stuck at the moment.

04:34.700 --> 04:37.050
I don't want to push Huntley too
hard and make her suspicious.

04:37.100 --> 04:39.650
No disrespect to Kate,
sir, it's no fault of hers,

04:39.700 --> 04:41.010
but we can't sit on our hands.

04:41.060 --> 04:43.450
Tim Ifield was police staff,
was implicated in a murder,

04:43.500 --> 04:44.530
and got murdered himself.

04:44.580 --> 04:46.650
Roz Huntley's reinstatement
puts her in the box seat

04:46.700 --> 04:49.210
to manipulate the inquiry just
like she did with Michael Farmer.

04:49.260 --> 04:51.730
- We've got to get in the game.
- Which will put Huntley on her guard.

04:51.780 --> 04:53.730
My undercover's a much
more subtle approach, sir.

04:53.780 --> 04:55.610
I've never disputed I'm
the blunt instrument.

04:55.660 --> 04:58.730
But this is bigger now than
just being about Huntley.

04:58.780 --> 05:00.170
I'm sorry, Kate, but Steve's right.

05:00.220 --> 05:03.170
We can't exist off the
crumbs off Huntley's table.

05:03.220 --> 05:04.570
Our informant has been killed.

05:04.620 --> 05:07.730
I won't rest until I find out
the who, the how and the why.

05:07.780 --> 05:08.890
Sir.

05:08.940 --> 05:10.650
Opening a wider inquiry
will give us access

05:10.700 --> 05:13.570
- to all the evidence Huntley's
team's been gathering. - Right.

05:13.620 --> 05:15.410
Well, back to the coal
face, the pair of you,

05:15.460 --> 05:19.020
- unless you've got more egg-sucking
tips for your granny? - Sir.

05:28.300 --> 05:31.850
Really, Ted, there's no need. As you were.

05:31.900 --> 05:34.210
Thank you, sir. I'll come
straight to the point, if I may.

05:34.260 --> 05:38.130
I'm opening a full-spectrum inquiry
into the murder of Timothy Ifield

05:38.180 --> 05:41.610
and, as per protocol, there
will be no reciprocity

05:41.660 --> 05:44.210
regarding DCI Huntley's investigation.

05:44.260 --> 05:46.530
I also register that my considered counsel

05:46.580 --> 05:51.130
in respect of DCI Roseanne
Huntley has been, er, disregarded.

05:51.180 --> 05:54.570
Now I see why you're upping the ante.

05:54.620 --> 05:58.170
- Challenge AC-12 at your peril.
- What?

05:58.220 --> 06:00.450
You didn't reinstate Huntley
because you were worried

06:00.500 --> 06:03.130
that Michael Farmer's defence
would make capital of the fact

06:03.180 --> 06:05.490
that the Senior Investigating
Officer was replaced?

06:05.540 --> 06:08.250
It was thanks to Roz Huntley's diligence

06:08.300 --> 06:11.290
we detected Ifield's involvement
in one of the prostitute murders.

06:11.340 --> 06:13.490
I'd say she's earned a second chance.

06:13.540 --> 06:16.690
And my team is intent to give
Michael Farmer a second chance.

06:16.740 --> 06:20.330
And we shall see which
one of us is right, sir,

06:20.380 --> 06:23.650
when we have access to all the evidence.

06:23.700 --> 06:24.740
All.

06:30.540 --> 06:32.820
- AC-12. Open the gate.
- Right. Thank you.

07:05.940 --> 07:07.060
Sorry.

07:11.220 --> 07:13.140
- Ma'am...
- It's OK, Jodie.

07:14.260 --> 07:15.660
Keep calm, everyone.

07:20.460 --> 07:23.490
All officers go to your desks.

07:23.540 --> 07:26.530
You'll each be questioned
by an AC-12 case worker.

07:26.580 --> 07:28.090
You'll each be obliged to surrender

07:28.140 --> 07:29.930
all materials relating
to Operation Trapdoor

07:29.980 --> 07:32.570
and the investigation into
the murder of Timothy Ifield.

07:32.620 --> 07:35.370
Failure to comply will be a breach
of your duties and responsibilities

07:35.420 --> 07:39.370
under Police Conduct Regulations
and may lead to a misconduct charge

07:39.420 --> 07:41.020
under said regulations.

07:42.620 --> 07:45.170
If you've got plans, cancel them.

07:45.220 --> 07:47.020
This takes as long as it takes.

07:48.980 --> 07:51.250
File keywords are Trapdoor and Ifield.

07:51.300 --> 07:54.330
Guard the door. No-one goes
in or out without my say-so.

07:54.380 --> 07:56.970
Thank you for your cooperation.

07:57.020 --> 07:58.770
All relevant files are to be surrendered

07:58.820 --> 08:00.700
for copying by AC-12 officers.

08:03.860 --> 08:06.250
- T-10. Cheers.
- OK.

08:06.300 --> 08:09.740
- T-11. On you go.
- Thanks.

08:12.900 --> 08:15.460
Right, you're all
familiar with this image.

08:17.900 --> 08:20.930
This is what Huntley's
team's been keeping from you.

08:20.980 --> 08:24.050
CCTV vidcap of the car
park of a DIY superstore

08:24.100 --> 08:26.730
at 19:33 on the 17th of March.

08:26.780 --> 08:30.380
That's the night before Tim Ifield
sent his final text message.

08:31.060 --> 08:34.130
Inside the store, 19:49 the same evening.

08:34.179 --> 08:37.490
He's got rid of the balaclava
so as not to arouse suspicion

08:37.539 --> 08:40.809
but he keeps his head down at all
times, he's put on a baseball cap.

08:40.860 --> 08:43.850
Unfortunately, this is the
best image they've got.

08:43.900 --> 08:46.530
Crime scene photograph
from Timothy Ifield's flat,

08:46.580 --> 08:48.730
showing tools that resemble
those being purchased

08:48.780 --> 08:50.330
on the evening of 17th of March.

08:50.380 --> 08:53.610
This DIY store's located less
than half a mile from Tim's flat.

08:53.660 --> 08:56.450
So this is Tim Ifield's murderer?

08:56.500 --> 08:59.970
Or... one detail from Tim's
postmortem that was overlooked --

09:00.020 --> 09:02.250
I reckoned at the time it
was an incidental find --

09:02.300 --> 09:06.100
is a number of dark wool fibres
were detected in Tim's hair and nose.

09:06.940 --> 09:08.450
He was wearing the balaclava?

09:08.500 --> 09:10.450
Unfortunately, none of
these items of clothing --

09:10.500 --> 09:11.930
the balaclava, the jacket or gloves --

09:11.980 --> 09:13.530
were found in the search of Tim's flat,

09:13.580 --> 09:15.890
so we can't link them to
Tim with 100% certainty.

09:15.940 --> 09:19.170
What's our level of certainty
regarding this person's ID?

09:19.220 --> 09:20.890
Well, his head's down in all the images,

09:20.940 --> 09:22.290
so facial recognition software

09:22.340 --> 09:24.410
hasn't been able to
provide us with a match,

09:24.460 --> 09:28.370
but body matching gives a 90%
probability it's Tim Ifield.

09:28.420 --> 09:31.010
So Balaclava Man could be Tim Ifield?

09:31.060 --> 09:33.900
Yes, sir. That's what
we now have to consider.

09:36.140 --> 09:39.050
For the DIR, I am showing Michael Farmer

09:39.100 --> 09:41.000
a photograph of Timothy Ifield.

09:42.140 --> 09:44.540
Michael, do you recognise this gentleman?

09:53.260 --> 09:56.020
For the DIR, the interviewee
is not responding.

09:58.500 --> 10:00.060
Michael, are you sure?

10:13.340 --> 10:15.970
Farmer denied any
connection with Tim Ifield.

10:16.020 --> 10:18.410
Also we looked through all
of Farmer's phone records

10:18.460 --> 10:21.250
and there's never been any
contact between the two of them.

10:21.300 --> 10:22.580
Sorry, boss.

10:25.860 --> 10:29.010
I was wondering -- could there be
another explanation, a simpler one?

10:29.060 --> 10:30.490
What could that be?

10:30.540 --> 10:32.740
That Tim was framing Michael Farmer.

10:34.020 --> 10:36.570
It's a valid thought,
Neil, don't get me wrong.

10:36.620 --> 10:38.330
I just think it's a bit much to ask us

10:38.380 --> 10:41.780
to discount the mass of
evidence against Michael Farmer.

10:42.700 --> 10:45.180
- It's mad to think
Farmer's not guilty. - Yes.

10:50.140 --> 10:52.650
There is one thing we can be sure of.

10:52.700 --> 10:54.090
What's that, Neil?

10:54.140 --> 10:57.730
Whoever killed Tim Ifield, it wasn't
Michael Farmer. He was in prison.

10:57.780 --> 11:01.650
We find Tim Ifield's
murderer, we crack this case.

11:01.700 --> 11:03.370
Absolutely.

11:03.420 --> 11:05.820
Thanks, Neil, Jodie.

11:20.140 --> 11:22.530
You're on shift at Polk
Avenue in the morning.

11:22.580 --> 11:24.210
You need to get some kip, mate.

11:24.260 --> 11:26.010
I could say the same.

11:26.060 --> 11:27.650
If Tim's Balaclava Man,

11:27.700 --> 11:30.890
why would he come to us saying
Michael Farmer's not guilty?

11:30.940 --> 11:32.700
He wouldn't.

11:35.420 --> 11:38.250
He'd be content to let Roz
Huntley send down Michael Farmer

11:38.300 --> 11:40.890
for the crimes he was committing.

11:40.940 --> 11:43.450
Instead, he came to us worried
Huntley got the wrong man.

11:43.500 --> 11:44.850
More than that, he accused her

11:44.900 --> 11:47.700
of deliberately protecting
the real offender.

11:49.180 --> 11:50.730
What?

11:50.780 --> 11:53.770
This CCTV gives us Tim's murder timeline.

11:53.820 --> 11:56.730
Tim's alive and kicking, out and
about on the night of the 17th.

11:56.780 --> 11:58.610
The following morning
was when Hana Reznikova

11:58.660 --> 12:02.290
- called round the flat for cleaning
and wasn't let in. - Correct.

12:02.340 --> 12:04.610
Didn't you report Huntley
called in sick one morning?

12:04.660 --> 12:07.010
- That no-one could get
hold of her? - Yeah.

12:07.060 --> 12:08.850
That was the morning of the 18th.

12:08.900 --> 12:11.450
The morning after the last
time Tim was seen alive.

12:11.500 --> 12:13.370
It's a bit of a coincidence
Huntley goes AWOL

12:13.420 --> 12:16.130
- right on the murder timeline.
- What are you saying, exactly?

12:16.180 --> 12:19.290
That it makes no sense for
Tim to be Balaclava Man.

12:19.340 --> 12:22.170
That his accusation that Huntley
was protecting the real offender

12:22.220 --> 12:24.570
could still be true. That
Huntley's conduct was suspicious

12:24.620 --> 12:27.290
around the time of Tim's murder.

12:27.340 --> 12:28.380
- HE SIGHS
- Look...

12:29.820 --> 12:31.770
.. I don't know how it all fits.

12:31.820 --> 12:33.810
But the timing does.

12:33.860 --> 12:36.570
So maybe we should start
thinking the unthinkable.

12:36.620 --> 12:39.730
Roz Huntley isn't just involved
in framing Michael Farmer.

12:39.780 --> 12:42.380
She's also somehow
involved in Tim's murder.

12:44.780 --> 12:46.810
Well, you're right about one thing.

12:46.860 --> 12:48.360
That is the unthinkable.

12:56.420 --> 12:58.850
This is starting to feel
like harassment, DS Arnott.

12:58.900 --> 13:03.210
Harassment, anti-corruption
inquiry. To-may-to, to-mah-to.

13:03.260 --> 13:04.690
PC Bindra.

13:04.740 --> 13:08.010
Ma'am, if we may, we're taking
your mobile phone in evidence.

13:08.060 --> 13:10.810
- You can't do that without
an authority... - Jodie.

13:10.860 --> 13:13.930
It's a police-issue device,
not my own personal property.

13:13.980 --> 13:16.250
They're at liberty to examine
it without authority.

13:16.300 --> 13:17.500
Thank you, ma'am.

13:25.100 --> 13:26.540
I've got nothing to hide.

13:28.740 --> 13:31.090
Thank you very much, ma'am.
You're at liberty to collect

13:31.140 --> 13:33.640
a replacement device at your convenience.

14:03.140 --> 14:04.450
Sorry, ma'am.

14:04.500 --> 14:06.050
No. No problem, Farida.

14:06.100 --> 14:07.970
Someone's come forward.

14:08.020 --> 14:10.010
From the appeal you asked us to put out.

14:10.060 --> 14:12.570
She didn't at the time cos she
didn't realise the significance.

14:12.620 --> 14:14.850
She's got a story that fits
Michael Farmer's offences

14:14.900 --> 14:16.290
for location and date.

14:16.340 --> 14:17.850
Great.

14:17.900 --> 14:19.530
Brilliant. Is Jodie still here?

14:19.580 --> 14:21.890
She's finished for the day,
ma'am. Shall I get Neil?

14:21.940 --> 14:23.690
It needs to be a female detective.

14:23.740 --> 14:25.090
Sorry, ma'am.

14:25.140 --> 14:27.330
Couldn't help overhearing
but I'm PIP level 2

14:27.380 --> 14:30.810
and video interview trained,
re: vulnerable victims of crime.

14:30.860 --> 14:32.780
OK. Let's see what you're made of.

14:38.420 --> 14:41.050
Melanie, my name's Detective
Sergeant Kate Flynn.

14:41.100 --> 14:43.330
I'm one of the detectives
looking into the attacks

14:43.380 --> 14:44.730
on a number of local women.

14:44.780 --> 14:46.890
Farida says you might
have some new information

14:46.940 --> 14:49.010
that can help with our inquiries?

14:49.060 --> 14:51.090
This happened a while ago.

14:51.140 --> 14:53.380
That's OK. What happened?

14:54.780 --> 14:57.780
I was walking home from
college through the estate.

14:58.740 --> 15:01.370
What happened to you, Melanie?

15:01.420 --> 15:03.740
A weird guy started talking to me.

15:05.340 --> 15:06.650
Weird how?

15:06.700 --> 15:09.170
He kept talking even
though I wasn't answering.

15:09.220 --> 15:11.340
I just kept walking faster.

15:13.260 --> 15:14.940
Then he grabbed hold of me.

15:16.060 --> 15:19.530
I'm sorry we have to keep
asking you these questions.

15:19.580 --> 15:21.130
But what else did he do to you?

15:21.180 --> 15:24.730
He said I was pretty and
he wanted to kiss me,

15:24.780 --> 15:27.140
wanted me to come back to his house.

15:29.100 --> 15:30.330
What did you do?

15:30.380 --> 15:33.130
I just ran as fast as I could.

15:33.180 --> 15:36.260
And then when I looked back,
he wasn't there any more.

15:38.540 --> 15:39.900
Did he give a name?

15:41.380 --> 15:42.880
I don't remember any name.

15:44.500 --> 15:46.930
Why didn't you report this at the time?

15:46.980 --> 15:49.810
I suppose I just wanted
to put it all behind me.

15:49.860 --> 15:52.850
I know this has been
really difficult for you.

15:52.900 --> 15:55.090
You've been a big help.

15:55.140 --> 15:59.330
What we need next from you is to
help identify who this man was.

15:59.380 --> 16:02.570
I've told you, I don't know who he is.

16:02.620 --> 16:06.970
We'd set up an identity parade where
we can show you video footage.

16:07.020 --> 16:10.610
We need a positive ID
that can stand up in court.

16:10.660 --> 16:12.140
I'd have to go to court?

16:15.380 --> 16:16.770
No. No way.

16:16.820 --> 16:19.330
I know it's a really big
thing for you to have to do.

16:19.380 --> 16:20.610
No, I'm not doing it. No way.

16:20.660 --> 16:22.770
Listen. We'll start
with an identity parade.

16:22.820 --> 16:24.250
I can't. No way. I can't.

16:24.300 --> 16:26.130
It's all done by video. He can't see you.

16:26.180 --> 16:27.970
I never would have come
in if anyone had told me.

16:28.020 --> 16:29.450
He could do this to someone else.

16:29.500 --> 16:30.850
We... we need your help.

16:30.900 --> 16:32.130
I wasn't expecting all this.

16:32.180 --> 16:34.850
Melanie, he's a very dangerous man.

16:34.900 --> 16:36.410
He has to be stopped.

16:36.460 --> 16:39.460
And the only way is for a
court to put him behind bars.

16:40.580 --> 16:42.860
Please can you help us do that, Melanie?

16:51.860 --> 16:53.180
Brave girl. Well done.

17:00.300 --> 17:02.330
- Maneet.
- Sarge.

17:02.380 --> 17:05.810
There are no suspicious entries
in DCI Huntley's call history

17:05.859 --> 17:09.250
or any suspicious texts or e-mails
during the murder timeline.

17:09.300 --> 17:11.970
All the calls from when she
left Polk Avenue Station

17:12.020 --> 17:14.490
are from family members
in her contact list.

17:14.540 --> 17:16.530
What about GPS data?

17:16.579 --> 17:18.930
Unfortunately, the phone was switched off

17:18.980 --> 17:20.250
for a large chunk of time.

17:20.300 --> 17:24.730
But the last GPS location on
the 17th and first on the 18th

17:24.780 --> 17:26.490
are DCI Huntley's home address,

17:26.540 --> 17:30.010
consistent with her
story of being off sick.

17:30.060 --> 17:31.130
Sorry, Sarge.

17:31.180 --> 17:33.170
Every piece of evidence
that Roz Huntley's got

17:33.220 --> 17:36.210
on Tim Ifield's murder
-- we go through it.

17:36.260 --> 17:38.610
Every piece, no matter how small.

17:38.660 --> 17:41.940
Funnily enough, that's what
we've all been doing, Sarge.

18:10.980 --> 18:15.650
Hi, Melanie. This way, please.
Thanks for coming in again.

18:15.700 --> 18:19.170
PC Nayar's going to take you through
the video identification process.

18:19.220 --> 18:22.370
You'll see nine unrelated men
of a similar age and appearance.

18:22.420 --> 18:23.850
All the videos are pre-recorded

18:23.900 --> 18:25.890
and none of the men are
in the police station.

18:25.940 --> 18:27.930
They can't see you, can't hear you --

18:27.980 --> 18:30.850
none of them know about who's
going to watch the videos.

18:30.900 --> 18:33.850
Any resemble the man that
attacked you, tell PC Nayar.

18:33.900 --> 18:34.930
OK.

18:34.980 --> 18:37.010
- Ready to start?
- Mm-hm.

18:37.060 --> 18:39.330
Melanie, as we explained earlier,

18:39.380 --> 18:41.210
we're not allowed to stay
in the room with you --

18:41.260 --> 18:44.210
it has to be an officer
unfamiliar with the suspect.

18:44.260 --> 18:45.300
OK.

18:49.020 --> 18:52.930
Each suspect is numbered and
you'll be shown each suspect twice.

18:52.980 --> 18:56.410
At the end, I'll ask you if you can
make a positive identification.

18:56.460 --> 18:57.740
Please, take a seat.

19:26.700 --> 19:28.700
This one seems dead nervous.

19:46.580 --> 19:49.690
Melanie was able to make a positive ID.

19:49.740 --> 19:52.370
- That's brilliant, Melanie.
Well done. - Well done.

19:52.420 --> 19:53.900
Ma'am. Melanie.

20:07.140 --> 20:10.460
It's really great work,
Kate. You delivered.

20:11.860 --> 20:15.650
If there's one reason why
we do this job, that is it.

20:15.700 --> 20:17.020
We protect life.

20:24.740 --> 20:27.450
I have to inform you, Michael,
that the witness was able

20:27.500 --> 20:30.210
to positively identify you from the video.

20:30.260 --> 20:32.930
Prior to the video identification,

20:32.980 --> 20:35.260
you denied the witness's allegations.

20:37.580 --> 20:39.100
I didn't mean to upset her.

20:43.020 --> 20:45.300
You're now admitting the allegations?

20:46.860 --> 20:48.770
Michael.

20:48.820 --> 20:50.690
Sorry.

20:50.740 --> 20:52.690
Yes.

20:52.740 --> 20:53.780
I'm sorry.

20:55.100 --> 20:56.700
Will you tell her I'm sorry?

20:58.260 --> 20:59.810
Yes, we can do that, Michael,

20:59.860 --> 21:02.610
but first I need to ask you what
you intended to do to this woman.

21:02.660 --> 21:05.260
Why did you want her to
come back to your house?

21:07.020 --> 21:08.260
I was lonely.

21:13.420 --> 21:16.170
Following a conversation
with the Senior Prosecutor,

21:16.220 --> 21:19.250
I have the authority to charge
you with the following offence --

21:19.300 --> 21:20.770
attempting to cause a person

21:20.820 --> 21:24.450
to engage in sexual
activity without consent.

21:24.500 --> 21:27.410
This charge will be included
in the charges against you

21:27.460 --> 21:31.850
when you appear in court, namely
for the murder of Baswinder Kaur,

21:31.900 --> 21:34.250
the murder of Leonie Collersdale,

21:34.300 --> 21:37.600
the kidnapping and attempted
murder of Hana Reznikova.

21:38.900 --> 21:41.500
Do you understand these
charges against you?

21:43.940 --> 21:45.530
Please answer.

21:47.380 --> 21:48.420
Yes.

21:51.340 --> 21:54.420
Time is now 10:20 and we're
switching off the machine.

21:58.140 --> 22:00.490
I'd like some time alone with my client.

22:00.540 --> 22:03.650
I think we need to discuss
the best way forward.

22:03.700 --> 22:05.060
Yes, of course.

22:08.860 --> 22:10.450
Michael.

22:10.500 --> 22:14.130
The charges against you are
going to be hard to fight.

22:14.180 --> 22:15.850
We can try and fight them.

22:15.900 --> 22:17.530
Or we can consider the best way

22:17.580 --> 22:21.170
to reduce the overall time
you end up serving in prison.

22:21.220 --> 22:24.930
- For Christ's sake! - All right,
everybody. Look, just calm down, OK?

22:24.980 --> 22:28.130
Steve, I get why you're pissed off,
but the ID process was by the book.

22:28.180 --> 22:29.370
Witnesses are eager to please.

22:29.420 --> 22:31.730
Non-verbal cues from the
officers involved led the witness

22:31.780 --> 22:34.250
to identify Michael Farmer,
whether she recognised him or not.

22:34.300 --> 22:35.650
Yeah, well, she did recognise him.

22:35.700 --> 22:37.490
Throw an accusation at
someone like Michael,

22:37.540 --> 22:39.410
the poor bastard starts
to believe he's guilty!

22:39.460 --> 22:40.650
All right, you made your point.

22:40.700 --> 22:42.330
We're supposed to be exonerating Farmer,

22:42.380 --> 22:45.010
- not sending him down for longer!
- No, we're meant to be investigating

22:45.060 --> 22:47.450
Roz Huntley, Operation Trapdoor
and the murder of Tim Ifield.

22:47.500 --> 22:48.490
Huntley shut you out,

22:48.540 --> 22:50.770
- so you played up to her to get
your undercover back. - What?!

22:50.820 --> 22:53.450
- That's not what happened at all!
- All right. Enough, the both of you.

22:53.500 --> 22:54.570
Now look.

22:54.620 --> 22:57.770
If there are concerns regarding the
accuracy of this identification --

22:57.820 --> 23:01.250
legitimate concerns, Kate, I might
add -- then we can take you out,

23:01.300 --> 23:02.770
reveal you as an undercover officer

23:02.820 --> 23:05.090
and we can make them repeat the ID parade.

23:05.140 --> 23:06.650
Sir, what's happened's happened.

23:06.700 --> 23:08.810
The fact is I've finally
gained Huntley's trust.

23:08.860 --> 23:10.810
By colluding in the framing
of an innocent man!

23:10.860 --> 23:13.570
DS Arnott, whether this
undercover continues or not

23:13.620 --> 23:16.170
is a matter entirely between
DS Fleming and myself.

23:16.220 --> 23:18.850
Therefore you are dismissed.

23:18.900 --> 23:19.940
Sir.

23:26.740 --> 23:27.810
Kate...

23:27.860 --> 23:30.370
Sir, I don't know if Michael
Farmer's guilty or innocent --

23:30.420 --> 23:31.410
none of us do.

23:31.460 --> 23:34.530
My job is to find out if Roz Huntley
has committed process corruption,

23:34.580 --> 23:36.690
and I've just had a massive breakthrough.

23:36.740 --> 23:38.540
I was shut out and now I'm in.

23:39.860 --> 23:41.170
All right.

23:41.220 --> 23:43.380
- Very good. Carry on.
- Thank you, sir.

23:54.180 --> 23:55.340
See ya.

24:00.740 --> 24:04.050
How long we reckon before Farmer
changes his plea to guilty?

24:04.100 --> 24:05.770
I've got a tenner says within the week.

24:05.820 --> 24:07.650
Ooh. Don't count your chickens.

24:07.700 --> 24:08.770
- THEY LAUGH
- She's counting.

24:08.820 --> 24:11.650
Hi. I hope you don't mind,
ma'am. I was on the e-mail.

24:11.700 --> 24:14.370
You're very welcome. And
thanks for your contribution.

24:14.420 --> 24:15.930
- Kate.
- Kate.

24:15.980 --> 24:17.330
I'm glad I could help.

24:17.380 --> 24:19.450
And listen, ma'am, I just
want to apologise again

24:19.500 --> 24:20.850
for how things started with us.

24:20.900 --> 24:22.970
I was a bit of a bull in a china shop.

24:23.020 --> 24:24.660
I'm not quite that delicate.

24:29.540 --> 24:31.050
All right?

24:31.100 --> 24:32.850
What have I missed?

24:32.900 --> 24:34.330
Getting a round in.

24:34.380 --> 24:36.170
Oh, great(!) Fancy another?

24:36.220 --> 24:37.330
No, I'm driving.

24:37.380 --> 24:38.370
Oh, shame.

24:38.420 --> 24:39.770
I'll just get mine then.

24:39.820 --> 24:41.210
Give us a shout if anyone wants one.

24:41.260 --> 24:43.050
I would.

24:43.100 --> 24:48.010
Now, Kate, could I ask you
a deeply personal question?

24:48.060 --> 24:49.250
Do you like curry?

24:50.580 --> 24:52.210
Yeah. Of course I like curry.

24:52.260 --> 24:54.090
I'm going to book the Dilshad. Are you in?

24:54.140 --> 24:55.490
Yeah. Definitely.

24:55.540 --> 24:57.890
Unfortunately, this
means you're going back.

24:57.940 --> 24:59.010
Sorry, ma'am?

24:59.060 --> 25:00.490
Despite all the leads we've shared,

25:00.540 --> 25:02.930
there's no link to your
East Mids missing person.

25:02.980 --> 25:05.650
I don't see much point in you
continuing your secondment.

25:05.700 --> 25:06.690
Yeah, but...

25:06.740 --> 25:07.900
Enjoying the party?

25:13.100 --> 25:14.650
How can I help you, DS Arnott?

25:14.700 --> 25:18.130
Tim Ifield's DNA was found
on Leonie Collersdale's body.

25:18.180 --> 25:21.410
You disclosed that to
Farmer's solicitor yet?

25:21.460 --> 25:23.130
As you know, DS Arnott,

25:23.180 --> 25:26.490
we're only obliged to carry out
full disclosure prior to the trial.

25:26.540 --> 25:28.490
Meaning you're counting
on there not being one.

25:28.540 --> 25:30.650
- What, are we doing the
defence's job now? - Kate.

25:30.700 --> 25:32.450
No. Just your own.

25:32.500 --> 25:33.810
Night, ma'am.

25:33.860 --> 25:36.900
You sleeping well while an
innocent man rots in jail?

25:41.500 --> 25:43.850
Wanker. Who does he think he is?

25:43.900 --> 25:45.250
A tosser, that's who.

25:49.540 --> 25:50.700
Night, Sarge.

25:59.060 --> 26:01.050
All right?

26:01.100 --> 26:02.690
All right.

26:02.740 --> 26:05.410
Roz didn't come for the curry
so I did an early swerve.

26:05.460 --> 26:08.060
Got your favourite, though -- lamb madras.

26:09.620 --> 26:10.780
I'll get the plates.

26:20.700 --> 26:23.020
What's the state of Huntley's marriage?

26:24.060 --> 26:26.860
I get the impression she's
a boring suburban mum.

26:31.740 --> 26:34.570
All the calls to Huntley's
phone on the night of the 17th,

26:34.620 --> 26:37.410
morning of the 18th,
were from family members.

26:37.460 --> 26:38.490
Her phone was off,

26:38.540 --> 26:41.250
and they eventually came
through as voicemails.

26:41.300 --> 26:44.170
On the 17th, there's a call
from the home landline at 18:06

26:44.220 --> 26:45.690
to her mobile.

26:45.740 --> 26:48.250
Only lasts a few seconds.
A misdial, maybe?

26:48.300 --> 26:51.170
Yeah, but then they try again
a couple of hours later.

26:51.220 --> 26:54.380
One of her kids, asking if
it's OK to order in a Domino's.

26:55.700 --> 26:56.930
If she's telling the truth,

26:56.980 --> 27:00.570
by then her family should've
known her whereabouts.

27:00.620 --> 27:02.260
The phone's home. She isn't.

27:41.700 --> 27:43.810
- Is everything OK?
- Oh...

27:43.860 --> 27:46.660
I've just got to keep it
protected while it heals.

27:51.860 --> 27:54.160
- Keep reading if you like.
- No, no, it's fine.

27:55.540 --> 27:57.260
I saw the Italian's reopened.

27:58.740 --> 28:00.490
- That's good.
- Yeah.

28:00.540 --> 28:03.930
We could go there on Friday or
Saturday night if you fancied.

28:03.980 --> 28:06.410
I'm working Friday.

28:06.460 --> 28:09.450
I think Soph's got something Saturday.

28:09.500 --> 28:12.740
Saturday, then -- just me and you.

28:14.700 --> 28:16.810
Sounds great.

28:16.860 --> 28:18.500
Haven't been there for ages.

28:22.460 --> 28:23.660
Sorry.

28:24.780 --> 28:25.820
I'm shattered.

28:28.260 --> 28:29.780
No, I'm sorry.

28:33.140 --> 28:35.620
You've been under so
much pressure at work.

28:38.140 --> 28:40.570
Do you want to talk about it?

28:40.620 --> 28:42.570
Thanks. I just want to nod off.

28:42.620 --> 28:43.700
OK.

28:51.580 --> 28:53.260
Yes. DCI Buckells.

29:21.460 --> 29:23.620
'Doors opening.'

29:28.540 --> 29:30.850
Mr Arnold. Nick Huntley.

29:30.900 --> 29:33.290
Come on through. Have you
been offered a tea or a coffee?

29:33.340 --> 29:35.450
I'm fine, thank you.

29:35.500 --> 29:39.130
Excuse the state, we're in
the process of moving floors.

29:39.180 --> 29:40.380
No worries.

29:41.780 --> 29:42.860
Right.

29:43.980 --> 29:45.490
How can I help you?

29:45.540 --> 29:46.530
Legal advice.

29:46.580 --> 29:48.930
Well, you've come to the right place.

29:48.980 --> 29:52.530
Suppose a man was found dead and
a suspect in the murder inquiry

29:52.580 --> 29:56.250
deliberately left their phone
at home to avoid GPS tracking.

29:56.300 --> 29:58.570
What would you advise the suspect?

29:58.620 --> 30:00.850
We practise corporate law.

30:00.900 --> 30:04.090
Hypothetically. What would
you advise the suspect?

30:04.140 --> 30:07.930
I can refer you to a colleague
at a criminal law firm.

30:07.980 --> 30:10.620
It's not me I'm talking
about, it's your wife.

30:12.180 --> 30:13.380
DS Arnott.

30:14.660 --> 30:17.610
Where was your wife on the
night of the 17th through to

30:17.660 --> 30:19.570
the morning of the 18th of March?

30:19.620 --> 30:21.530
- Erm...
- HE CLEARS THROAT

30:21.580 --> 30:22.980
Right.

30:24.780 --> 30:27.490
Presumably you are aware
of the law regarding

30:27.540 --> 30:29.450
the compellability of a spouse?

30:29.500 --> 30:31.770
Normally the spouse is the
one corroborating the alibi,

30:31.820 --> 30:33.970
- not undermining it.
- Right.

30:34.020 --> 30:36.930
- I mean, you are disputing
your wife's alibi? - Wait. No...

30:36.980 --> 30:39.330
Your wife claims she was
home the 17th and 18th

30:39.380 --> 30:41.370
recovering from illness.

30:41.420 --> 30:42.970
Before I talk to you any more

30:43.020 --> 30:45.490
I would like to have a chat with my wife.

30:45.540 --> 30:48.410
Is there anything else I can
help you with today, Officer?

30:48.460 --> 30:52.970
"Mr Huntley unable to confirm wife's
whereabouts on the 17th/18th."

30:53.020 --> 30:54.570
No, I didn't say that.

30:54.620 --> 30:56.370
"Mr Huntley denies the above."

30:56.420 --> 30:58.340
I need to talk to Roz.

31:00.460 --> 31:04.250
I need you to talk to me,
sir. Within 48 hours.

31:04.300 --> 31:07.200
Better it's voluntary than
I have to come looking.

31:35.380 --> 31:36.850
This DS Arnold...

31:36.900 --> 31:38.530
why is he asking these questions?

31:38.580 --> 31:42.330
Arnott. It's a work thing. It's routine.

31:42.380 --> 31:46.530
Well, he said somebody had died.

31:46.580 --> 31:48.890
It didn't seem like routine.

31:48.940 --> 31:50.580
It's my work, Nick.

31:53.220 --> 31:55.570
So we're not discussing
it? Hm, since when?

31:55.620 --> 31:57.810
There are certain sensitive
aspects of my work that are

31:57.860 --> 32:00.570
inappropriate to share outside
the service communication loop.

32:00.620 --> 32:02.450
You know that.

32:02.500 --> 32:05.730
Well, it didn't stop him interviewing me.

32:05.780 --> 32:09.900
They're anti-corruption. They make
a mountain out of every molehill.

32:12.180 --> 32:15.060
Anti-corruption? What have you done?

32:17.540 --> 32:18.980
Nothing.

32:26.220 --> 32:28.330
Why, erm...

32:28.380 --> 32:30.820
Why didn't you let me know where you were?

32:32.820 --> 32:36.970
I told you, I left my phone
at home and I couldn't call.

32:37.020 --> 32:38.660
You were at work?

32:40.380 --> 32:43.820
It was a specialist op, not
many people knew about it.

32:45.140 --> 32:47.980
Well, it seems like no-one knew about it.

32:51.980 --> 32:54.680
He had the impression
that you were at home ill.

33:03.620 --> 33:05.300
Roz, were you with someone?

33:17.740 --> 33:21.570
I love you and I've always trusted you,

33:21.620 --> 33:23.330
but for the sake of our marriage

33:23.380 --> 33:25.570
and for the sake of our kids...

33:25.620 --> 33:27.220
I need the truth.

33:30.820 --> 33:32.500
OK.

33:37.500 --> 33:40.060
AC-12 are investigating one of my cases.

33:41.260 --> 33:43.460
Looking for an angle to discredit me.

33:44.500 --> 33:47.660
Internal politics, 100% total bollocks.

33:49.740 --> 33:53.940
I'm sorry they involved you, but
that is their kind of mind game.

33:55.500 --> 33:57.050
And the bastards get away with it

33:57.100 --> 34:00.540
cos they claim they're enforcing
professional standards.

34:01.540 --> 34:03.860
You still haven't answered my question.

34:06.140 --> 34:10.100
I was working.

34:14.219 --> 34:16.060
And there ends this crappy day.

34:18.860 --> 34:20.380
I need a bath.

34:23.380 --> 34:24.900
I love you.

35:09.620 --> 35:10.930
'Steve.'

35:10.980 --> 35:12.210
I'll call you back.

35:12.260 --> 35:14.370
DS Steve Arnott, DC James Desford.

35:14.420 --> 35:17.370
I'm putting you two together on
the Huntley inquiry. Is that OK?

35:17.420 --> 35:19.820
Any questions? No. Good. Carry on.

35:24.540 --> 35:27.210
Actually, it's Jamie, not James.

35:27.260 --> 35:28.650
Great.

35:28.700 --> 35:31.010
Well, it's good to be
working with you, Steve.

35:31.060 --> 35:33.660
- All right to call you Steve?
- We'll see.

35:44.460 --> 35:45.450
Hi.

35:45.500 --> 35:47.090
KNOCK ON DOOR Yeah.

35:47.140 --> 35:49.690
- I thought me and Kate were doing fine, sir.
- Well, of course you are,

35:49.740 --> 35:51.650
but there's just so much
more ground to cover now.

35:51.700 --> 35:54.370
- And you know, the less Kate is
here, the safer it is for her. - Sir.

35:54.420 --> 35:55.930
Besides, if you're going to step up,

35:55.980 --> 35:58.250
I'm going to need you to
train up a new investigator.

35:58.300 --> 36:00.730
I can't have one of my inspectors
gallivanting all over town

36:00.780 --> 36:03.280
chasing every last lead
that's going. Go on.

36:05.940 --> 36:08.050
- Jamie.
- Hi. Maneet.

36:08.100 --> 36:10.130
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

36:10.180 --> 36:12.290
- My first day.
- Yeah, how you getting on?

36:12.340 --> 36:13.970
Yeah, good.

36:14.020 --> 36:15.500
So when's it due?

36:16.580 --> 36:18.700
What? You're saying I look pregnant?

36:19.700 --> 36:21.970
No, no, I was...

36:22.020 --> 36:24.460
Of course I am. End of June.

36:34.700 --> 36:38.050
Tim's downstairs neighbour, the
nurse, we ought to have another go

36:38.100 --> 36:41.130
at finding out if she
saw anyone suspicious.

36:41.180 --> 36:42.770
What's going on here?

36:42.820 --> 36:44.930
Just getting on with
things while you were out.

36:44.980 --> 36:46.290
Great.

36:46.340 --> 36:49.050
Ma'am, we've looked right back
over all cases Tim was involved in,

36:49.100 --> 36:51.130
convictions that hinged
on forensic evidence

36:51.180 --> 36:52.770
where maybe the offender held a grudge.

36:52.820 --> 36:56.420
- A violent offender, recently
released. - And? - Nothing. - Nothing.

37:00.340 --> 37:01.780
Can you stop that?!

37:04.340 --> 37:07.010
See, there's a lot of
theories kicking around here,

37:07.060 --> 37:08.770
and a lack of basic coppering.

37:08.820 --> 37:12.010
Tim's killer had to get in that
flat and he had to get out.

37:12.060 --> 37:14.700
Who was in the area?
Who was in that street?

37:16.100 --> 37:19.170
Who was hanging around outside that flat?

37:19.220 --> 37:21.420
Find him, and that's the whole case.

37:22.940 --> 37:24.940
It's not bleeding rocket science.

37:26.140 --> 37:27.930
Jez, how are you?

37:29.500 --> 37:30.890
Hilarious, mate.

37:30.940 --> 37:33.530
We already know who was there.

37:33.580 --> 37:34.860
Who?

37:35.900 --> 37:39.410
Hana Reznikova was the last
person known to have had contact

37:39.460 --> 37:42.060
with the victim. We need
to talk to her again.

37:45.940 --> 37:48.660
- Please, do it. - Ma'am. - Boss.

37:58.340 --> 38:00.180
I'll make a note of that.

38:03.380 --> 38:05.570
I hope it's not too much hassle coming in,

38:05.620 --> 38:07.490
- the hours you work.
- Day off.

38:07.540 --> 38:09.690
It's a good job you didn't
come in in your uniform.

38:09.740 --> 38:11.530
(Some of that lot, you know.)

38:11.580 --> 38:12.810
All right.

38:12.860 --> 38:15.210
You all right, Sarge.
Er, did you meet Gemma?

38:15.260 --> 38:16.770
Tim's downstairs neighbour.

38:16.820 --> 38:20.250
- Yeah. Hi, again. - Hi.
- You OK? - I'm fine.

38:20.300 --> 38:22.610
Sir, we're just going over
some details now we've got

38:22.660 --> 38:25.380
- a better handle on
Tim's timeline. - Right.

38:29.900 --> 38:33.210
Polk Avenue interviewed Gemma
immediately after Tim's body

38:33.260 --> 38:36.290
was found, but she said they
haven't been in touch since, so...

38:36.340 --> 38:37.860
OK.

38:40.060 --> 38:43.610
As we were saying, we're
now focusing our inquiry on

38:43.660 --> 38:47.330
- the night of the 17th,
morning of the 18th. - OK.

38:47.380 --> 38:52.330
We're hoping the fact we can be more
precise will help focus your memory.

38:52.380 --> 38:54.610
Erm, the 17th I was on a late,

38:54.660 --> 38:58.610
so I would have got home around
11, if we didn't go on somewhere.

38:58.660 --> 39:02.770
- We do Malibu a couple of times a month.
- That's a cool club.

39:02.820 --> 39:04.970
I got in around 11.

39:05.020 --> 39:07.210
And when did you next leave your flat?

39:07.260 --> 39:08.770
The next day I had a late,

39:08.820 --> 39:12.330
so I would have had a
lie-in maybe till lunchtime.

39:12.380 --> 39:15.130
Did you hear any kind of
disturbance that night?

39:15.180 --> 39:17.250
No.

39:17.300 --> 39:18.650
Right.

39:18.700 --> 39:21.650
Go back to when you got in,
11pm, the night of the 17th.

39:21.700 --> 39:23.210
No, actually, I did go out,

39:23.260 --> 39:26.530
but I came home first because I
forgot to bring a change of clothes.

39:26.580 --> 39:29.130
And I called a taxi and I
thought he was already there,

39:29.180 --> 39:32.850
but they normally send a text, so I
realised that it couldn't be mine.

39:32.900 --> 39:35.050
Great. Great.

39:35.100 --> 39:37.690
So you witnessed a cab
outside the flats around 11pm

39:37.740 --> 39:40.130
- on the night of the 17th?
- I think it was a cab.

39:40.180 --> 39:41.860
Can you describe the driver?

39:45.860 --> 39:48.730
Erm, no. It was dark and I
didn't really look, I'm sorry.

39:48.780 --> 39:51.090
Come on, you kidding? You've been a star.

39:51.140 --> 39:54.130
Look, anything else jogs your
memory, you give me a call, OK?

39:54.180 --> 39:56.090
- Any time.
- Sure.

39:56.140 --> 39:57.580
I'll show you out.

40:00.300 --> 40:01.810
Just down there.

40:01.860 --> 40:03.450
Maybe I'll see you in Malibu.

40:03.500 --> 40:05.610
If this lead pans out,
I'll buy you a drink.

40:05.660 --> 40:07.010
Cheers, Gemma.

40:07.060 --> 40:08.570
(Do you have a second?)

40:08.620 --> 40:10.100
Yeah.

40:12.540 --> 40:15.890
The cab driver, he was white.
That's all I could tell.

40:15.940 --> 40:18.610
I just didn't want to say it
in front of Jamie just in case

40:18.660 --> 40:20.850
it sounded like I thought
all cabbies had to be black.

40:20.900 --> 40:22.660
That's fine. Thank you.

40:28.900 --> 40:32.170
It's a bit crap Huntley's team
never re-interviewed Gemma.

40:32.220 --> 40:35.210
Huntley's deliberately leading the
inquiry in the wrong direction.

40:35.260 --> 40:37.250
If Tim Ifield isn't Balaclava Man,

40:37.300 --> 40:40.010
there's another suspect,
and he's still out there.

40:40.060 --> 40:41.890
So let's be the ones to find him.

40:41.940 --> 40:43.410
Good.

40:43.460 --> 40:45.290
Gemma said the driver was white.

40:45.340 --> 40:48.290
I'll get Maneet to run cab companies
for bookings round that time

40:48.340 --> 40:50.570
and rule out any ME-sounding names.

40:50.620 --> 40:53.010
Here's hoping you'll owe her a drink.

40:53.060 --> 40:56.570
That's an interview technique. I'd
never mess about with a witness.

40:56.620 --> 41:00.330
I know some of the blokes do,
but it's a bit desperate,

41:00.380 --> 41:02.900
do you know what I mean? Cheers, Sarge.

41:04.900 --> 41:06.130
Am I in trouble?

41:06.180 --> 41:08.290
'Thank you for coming in
to talk to us again, Hana.

41:08.340 --> 41:11.850
'This is a voluntary interview,
you're free to leave at any time.'

41:11.900 --> 41:13.770
But I've told you everything I know.

41:13.820 --> 41:15.370
'Since your previous interview,

41:15.420 --> 41:17.810
'we've uncovered some new
evidence we'd like to put to you.'

41:17.860 --> 41:21.570
For the DIR, I'm showing Ms
Reznikova item reference JHF-9,

41:21.620 --> 41:25.210
showing a DIY store car park and
a figure wearing a balaclava.

41:25.260 --> 41:27.730
Yes. He looks like the
man who attacked me.

41:27.780 --> 41:29.370
According to your witness statement,

41:29.420 --> 41:32.010
on the evening of the 9th of
March, you were set upon by

41:32.060 --> 41:35.850
a man wearing a balaclava who forced
you into his vehicle and transported

41:35.900 --> 41:39.450
you to an address on the Borogrove
Estate belonging to Michael Farmer.

41:39.500 --> 41:41.210
Yes, Michael Farmer.

41:41.260 --> 41:43.130
'We know this can't be Michael Farmer.'

41:43.180 --> 41:45.290
He was in custody at the time.

41:45.340 --> 41:47.740
We believe this must be Timothy Ifield.

41:49.100 --> 41:53.090
For the DIR, I'm showing Ms
Reznikova item reference JHF-10,

41:53.140 --> 41:56.770
showing the same man purchasing
a number of power tools.

41:56.820 --> 41:58.970
No, I don't know anything
about this at all.

41:59.020 --> 42:03.690
Hana, we wonder if you have any
idea at all why Timothy Ifield

42:03.740 --> 42:06.090
would be dressed exactly
as you've described the man

42:06.140 --> 42:08.450
who abducted you five nights earlier?

42:08.500 --> 42:10.570
I don't know.

42:10.620 --> 42:13.890
'Tim Ifield was the Police Forensic
Coordinator present on the scene'

42:13.940 --> 42:16.450
when you were rescued from
Michael Farmer's house.

42:16.500 --> 42:19.530
You told us he came into
the cafe where you worked

42:19.580 --> 42:21.210
and asked you to become his cleaner.

42:21.260 --> 42:23.130
Are you certain you didn't recognise him?

42:23.180 --> 42:24.730
I had never seen him before.

42:24.780 --> 42:27.580
He'd seen you. He knew
exactly who you were.

42:28.940 --> 42:30.930
No alarm bells rang?

42:30.980 --> 42:33.610
- No.
- "No."

42:33.660 --> 42:34.930
Come on.

42:34.980 --> 42:36.330
'When you do go into the flat,'

42:36.380 --> 42:39.610
you get a weird text
telling you not to come in.

42:39.660 --> 42:41.930
Still you don't think there's
something funny going on?

42:41.980 --> 42:43.700
- No.
- "No."

42:44.700 --> 42:47.130
I am telling the truth.

42:47.180 --> 42:49.450
'Would you like to take a break, Hana?'

42:49.500 --> 42:51.330
No, I'm not a criminal.

42:51.380 --> 42:54.250
'No-one's saying you are, Hana.'

42:54.300 --> 42:57.690
'A waitress doesn't earn very
much. Neither does a cleaner.

42:57.740 --> 43:01.010
'You needed the job, so maybe
you set your suspicions aside?'

43:01.060 --> 43:02.370
No.

43:02.420 --> 43:04.090
- But you needed the job?
- Yes.

43:04.140 --> 43:07.010
Hana, our inquiries say you
didn't chase him up at all.

43:07.060 --> 43:10.090
Not one call or text from
you to Timothy Ifield's

43:10.140 --> 43:12.410
registered mobile phone after the 18th.

43:12.460 --> 43:14.690
Why were you so happy
to lose his business?

43:14.740 --> 43:16.610
I just didn't know what to do, OK?

43:16.660 --> 43:18.410
I didn't know what was happening.

43:18.460 --> 43:20.730
You were the last person we
know of to visit Tim's flat.

43:20.780 --> 43:22.890
'Maybe that's when you recognised him?'

43:22.940 --> 43:24.610
No.

43:24.660 --> 43:27.450
'Hana, are you sure you
wouldn't prefer to take a break?

43:27.500 --> 43:29.410
'We don't mind.'

43:29.460 --> 43:31.060
We're just confused.

43:35.460 --> 43:38.050
For the DIR, DCI Huntley
has entered the room.

43:38.100 --> 43:40.460
- Farida.
- Ma'am.

43:42.300 --> 43:47.300
For the DIR, DCI Huntley,
I've taken PC Jatri's seat.

43:49.340 --> 43:53.250
The interviewee does not
appear oppressed by my arrival.

43:53.300 --> 43:55.450
- Hana?
- Yes, I'm fine.

43:55.500 --> 43:58.090
Thank you, Hana. Let me explain.

43:58.140 --> 44:00.050
Since we first interviewed you,

44:00.100 --> 44:02.930
certain things have become
part of our working hypothesis

44:02.980 --> 44:06.210
regarding how Timothy
Ifield met his death.

44:06.260 --> 44:09.330
Forensic evidence very strongly
suggests he was wearing

44:09.380 --> 44:12.530
a white forensic oversuit
at the time of his death.

44:12.580 --> 44:16.940
Fibres in his hair and nose suggest
he'd been wearing a balaclava.

44:18.260 --> 44:21.970
He was in possession of not
only a number of power tools,

44:22.020 --> 44:24.140
but also a set of kitchen knives.

44:26.420 --> 44:29.770
As a woman, I can well
imagine the level of terror

44:29.820 --> 44:32.690
if I were to encounter that situation.

44:32.740 --> 44:38.380
I wonder if a woman went to
Tim's flat... she entered...

44:39.780 --> 44:42.610
.. Tim appeared as I've described.

44:42.660 --> 44:46.330
This woman would quite rightly
be in fear for her life.

44:46.380 --> 44:50.290
This man clearly intended to assault her,

44:50.340 --> 44:54.170
kill her, dismember her body.

44:54.220 --> 44:57.570
If she put up a fight, she would
not have committed a crime.

44:57.620 --> 45:02.050
This woman was already
traumatised by a recent abduction.

45:02.100 --> 45:04.650
It was self-defence.

45:04.700 --> 45:06.530
I didn't do what you say.

45:06.580 --> 45:08.410
This woman was terrified.

45:08.460 --> 45:11.170
If she confessed, would
a court believe her?

45:11.220 --> 45:13.690
She didn't have long to make up her mind.

45:13.740 --> 45:16.900
She could lose her job, her family.

45:18.180 --> 45:20.530
She might be deported.

45:20.580 --> 45:22.380
But she knows how to clean.

45:24.260 --> 45:25.930
I didn't do it.

45:25.980 --> 45:28.770
Help us to help you, Hana.

45:28.820 --> 45:31.330
Let us search your home.

45:31.380 --> 45:33.340
Let us rule you out as a suspect.

45:34.340 --> 45:36.250
You want to search my flat?

45:36.300 --> 45:39.290
It's done by a specialist team.
They won't damage anything.

45:39.340 --> 45:43.050
- Anything they need to take away
will be returned to you. - No!

45:43.100 --> 45:45.410
You're refusing to permit
us entry to your flat?

45:45.460 --> 45:47.450
I haven't done anything wrong.

45:47.500 --> 45:50.820
I'm sorry, Hana, we really
need to search your flat.

45:52.540 --> 45:55.570
Jodie, Section 18. Do it.

45:55.620 --> 45:57.890
DCI Huntley leaving the room.

45:57.940 --> 46:00.490
Hana Reznikova, I am arresting
you in connection with the murder

46:00.540 --> 46:02.050
of Timothy Ifield.

46:02.100 --> 46:04.810
This arrest meets the
necessity test under Code G of

46:04.860 --> 46:06.730
the Police and Criminal Evidence Act,

46:06.780 --> 46:09.530
namely the prompt and effective
investigation of an offence,

46:09.580 --> 46:13.380
permitting a lawful search of your
address as part of our inquiry.

46:50.940 --> 46:53.340
Interview them, asked them what they saw.

46:55.860 --> 46:57.380
One sec.

47:17.980 --> 47:20.330
I'm just after some background
info on an item of evidence

47:20.380 --> 47:22.130
from Tim Ifield's flat.

47:22.180 --> 47:26.970
KRG-13. Forensic samples
were taken on the 23rd March.

47:27.020 --> 47:30.820
Stored overnight and then sent
to the lab the following morning.

47:36.500 --> 47:38.400
She went to the Forensic Office.

47:40.180 --> 47:41.370
What's she up to?

47:41.420 --> 47:43.130
I spoke to an FI after she'd gone.

47:43.180 --> 47:47.810
Kate was asking for details
about item reference KRG-13.

47:47.860 --> 47:49.730
You know what that is?

47:49.780 --> 47:52.890
It's the isolated blood spatter
deposit found at Tim's flat.

47:52.940 --> 47:55.930
The FI who had handled it
had mistakenly wrote KRG-30

47:55.980 --> 47:57.860
and then corrected it to KRG-13.

47:59.140 --> 48:00.850
And what did they make of that?

48:00.900 --> 48:03.570
Oh, it was noted, but no
concerns have been raised.

48:03.620 --> 48:05.090
Sounds like a slip of the pen.

48:05.140 --> 48:07.780
Yeah. What do you reckon
she's up to, ma'am?

48:09.580 --> 48:12.290
Ambitious DS, that's all,

48:12.340 --> 48:16.050
wants to impress her
gaffer back at East Mids.

48:16.100 --> 48:19.460
- Not that there's anything
wrong with ambition. - No, ma'am.

48:21.180 --> 48:23.210
We should do a drink soon.

48:23.260 --> 48:25.810
It'd be good to have a natter
about your plans for the future.

48:25.860 --> 48:29.300
I'd really appreciate
that, ma'am, thank you.

48:31.780 --> 48:34.380
- Bye, ma'am.
- Bye, Jodie.

48:46.180 --> 48:48.090
- Kate.
- Ma'am?

48:48.140 --> 48:50.740
Relax, Kate, it's good news, I hope.

48:51.740 --> 48:53.610
I've been reviewing your secondment here.

48:53.660 --> 48:57.010
We need manpower and you're
a fully trained detective.

48:57.060 --> 48:59.610
I think I can make a case for
extending your stay with us.

48:59.660 --> 49:01.170
Assuming that appeals?

49:01.220 --> 49:03.650
Yeah, absolutely, ma'am. Thank you.

49:03.700 --> 49:06.340
- It's great working with you.
- Likewise, ma'am.

49:07.900 --> 49:09.860
- Night.
- Night.

49:17.060 --> 49:20.890
The overwriting was noted at every
stage of the evidence being handled.

49:20.940 --> 49:23.490
It doesn't appear anyone
was trying to cover it up.

49:23.540 --> 49:25.850
Still we should make a
confidential request to examine

49:25.900 --> 49:27.370
the original samples ourselves.

49:27.420 --> 49:29.250
It's a crucial item and
any irregularity...

49:29.300 --> 49:32.530
Is something to throw in Huntley's face?

49:32.580 --> 49:34.810
This isn't personal.

49:34.860 --> 49:36.810
She's at the centre of everything.

49:36.860 --> 49:38.690
I just want to get to the truth.

49:38.740 --> 49:40.260
Me too, mate.

49:41.500 --> 49:43.140
See you soon.

49:52.580 --> 49:54.340
Kate, Roz is asking for you.

49:55.380 --> 49:56.610
What's going on?

49:56.660 --> 50:00.060
Just got the report on the
search of Hana Reznikova's flat.

50:03.780 --> 50:05.930
Item reference AS-9.

50:05.980 --> 50:10.250
The search of your flat detected
banknotes in the sum of £5,900

50:10.300 --> 50:12.810
concealed in a kitchen cupboard.

50:12.860 --> 50:16.570
Item reference MHM-27.

50:16.620 --> 50:20.610
Search of your household waste
detected multiple used condoms

50:20.660 --> 50:23.290
containing semen from multiple males.

50:23.340 --> 50:25.810
'How do you account for these findings?'

50:25.860 --> 50:28.570
(No comment.)

50:28.620 --> 50:30.180
No comment.

50:31.460 --> 50:34.620
'Items referenced JF-3 to JF-7.'

50:36.140 --> 50:40.250
Examination of bed linen and bath
towels detected DNA from multiple

50:40.300 --> 50:45.050
males one of which matched control
samples held in the police database,

50:45.100 --> 50:47.740
said DNA belonged to Timothy Ifield.

50:50.660 --> 50:53.360
What was Timothy Ifield
doing in your bed, Hana?

50:54.260 --> 50:55.770
(No comment.)

50:55.820 --> 50:57.260
No comment.

50:59.220 --> 51:01.210
Item reference AS-24.

51:01.260 --> 51:04.530
The search detected an
unregistered mobile phone.

51:04.580 --> 51:08.610
Unlocking of said phone provided a
call history containing four calls

51:08.660 --> 51:12.290
between you and a number whose
user we've been unable to identify.

51:12.340 --> 51:15.490
The first call occurring on the 16th March

51:15.540 --> 51:18.050
and the last on the 18th March.

51:18.100 --> 51:20.850
What was the nature of these calls?

51:20.900 --> 51:22.050
(No comment.)

51:22.100 --> 51:23.290
No comment.

51:23.340 --> 51:26.490
'Hana, we've got evidence strongly
suggesting that you've been

51:26.540 --> 51:29.330
'engaging in sexual activity
for commercial gain.'

51:29.380 --> 51:32.850
We've got calls on an unregistered
phone that presumably you used

51:32.900 --> 51:35.050
'to arrange these encounters.

51:35.100 --> 51:38.170
'We've got evidence Timothy
Ifield was present in your flat,

51:38.220 --> 51:41.170
'presumably for sexual services.'

51:41.220 --> 51:44.970
Now this unidentified unregistered
phone that you had calls with

51:45.020 --> 51:46.500
on four occasions...

51:47.700 --> 51:50.400
.. were these calls to
and from Timothy Ifield?

51:51.660 --> 51:52.850
(No comment.)

51:52.900 --> 51:55.090
Hana, wake up.

51:55.140 --> 51:58.450
We're carrying out an investigation
into an unsolved murder.

51:58.500 --> 52:00.490
Now if you didn't kill Timothy Ifield,

52:00.540 --> 52:03.250
telling us that this was a phone of
his that we know nothing about yet,

52:03.300 --> 52:05.170
that would really help us.

52:05.220 --> 52:08.120
And it may help prove that
you weren't his murderer.

52:10.460 --> 52:13.500
'Hana, frankly, right now
for you this is a lifeline.'

52:17.060 --> 52:18.460
It was Timothy's phone.

52:22.140 --> 52:23.730
'Brilliant. Thank you.'

52:23.780 --> 52:25.740
'But I wasn't harming anyone.'

52:27.180 --> 52:28.980
You have ruined my life.

52:30.100 --> 52:31.700
'No, we protect life.'

52:39.940 --> 52:41.650
Great.

52:41.700 --> 52:43.690
It's good work, guys.

52:43.740 --> 52:46.130
Just because they had sex
doesn't mean Hana killed Tim.

52:46.180 --> 52:47.850
True.

52:47.900 --> 52:49.890
But he invited her back to his flat.

52:49.940 --> 52:51.250
She hadn't been there before.

52:51.300 --> 52:53.490
We know that because we
didn't detect any of her DNA

52:53.540 --> 52:55.250
or fingerprints in his flat.

52:55.300 --> 52:58.130
He gained her trust, lured
her there to kill her.

52:58.180 --> 53:00.410
She killed him in self-defence.

53:00.460 --> 53:02.490
We're a whisker away
from finding the evidence

53:02.540 --> 53:05.410
we'll need to charge her.
It's all falling into place.

53:05.460 --> 53:09.970
The only hole is proving that
Michael Farmer and Tim Ifield

53:10.020 --> 53:12.410
were accomplices and then we've
cracked the whole damn case.

53:12.460 --> 53:14.130
Yes, ma'am.

53:14.180 --> 53:16.330
We've got this lead now
on Tim's burner phone.

53:16.380 --> 53:18.850
Chances are we're going to open
up a whole new can of worms about

53:18.900 --> 53:22.500
- what he was up to in the time
round his death. - Hopefully. - Yeah.

53:29.540 --> 53:32.290
I'm afraid I've drawn a blank
on taxis picking up from

53:32.340 --> 53:34.170
Tim Ifield's street on
the night of the 17th.

53:34.220 --> 53:36.130
- Right.
- But...

53:36.180 --> 53:39.410
I've been looking at traffic
camera footage from that night.

53:39.460 --> 53:42.730
This is a junction a quarter
of a mile from Tim's flat.

53:42.780 --> 53:46.570
I didn't spot a taxi, but I looked
for vehicles resembling a minicab.

53:46.620 --> 53:50.410
And this dark Mercedes E-class
saloon passes through at 23:31

53:50.460 --> 53:53.610
heading in the direction
away from Tim's flat.

53:53.660 --> 53:58.610
And here it is earlier that evening
at 18.36 heading towards Tim's flat.

53:58.660 --> 54:00.450
Any chance we'll be able to read the reg?

54:00.500 --> 54:02.010
I've sent the images for enhancement.

54:02.060 --> 54:03.810
I'll let you know the moment I hear back.

54:03.860 --> 54:05.740
Cheers, Maneet. Well done.

54:14.860 --> 54:16.090
Holding.

54:16.140 --> 54:18.330
Anyone had further contact
from Huntley's husband?

54:18.380 --> 54:19.850
Not that I know of.

54:19.900 --> 54:22.100
He can't say I didn't give him a chance.

54:30.900 --> 54:34.130
'You've reached Nicholas Huntley
of Webber and Barratt Partners LLP.

54:34.180 --> 54:35.580
'Please leave a message.'

54:37.340 --> 54:41.620
Mr Huntley, DS Arnott.
AC-12. We need to talk.

54:42.660 --> 54:45.050
You've excelled yourself, Roz.

54:45.100 --> 54:46.460
Thank you, sir.

54:48.140 --> 54:51.490
Trapdoor's been the
toughest months of my life.

54:51.540 --> 54:54.370
I appreciate the backing
you've given me, sir.

54:54.420 --> 54:58.850
You were a star in training college,
then you put your family first.

54:58.900 --> 55:02.250
I'm only putting you back where
you belong. What are friends for?

55:02.300 --> 55:04.140
Hm?

55:05.660 --> 55:07.250
Thank you very much, sir.

55:10.140 --> 55:11.940
Sorry.

55:29.540 --> 55:33.180
'Mr Huntley, DS Arnott.
AC-12. We need to talk.'

55:44.980 --> 55:47.130
He's gone to see Huntley's husband.

55:47.180 --> 55:49.170
Anything I can do?

55:49.220 --> 55:53.490
Image enhancement got a reg number
on the vehicle seen near Tim's flat.

55:53.540 --> 55:56.090
I need to tell Steve right away.

55:56.140 --> 55:58.370
Mr Huntley, DS Arnott, again.

55:58.420 --> 56:00.650
'I was hoping you'd have
come back to me by now'

56:00.700 --> 56:02.250
on the matter we discussed.

56:02.300 --> 56:05.890
I've spoken to a colleague
of mine, a criminal solicitor,

56:05.940 --> 56:07.370
called Jimmy Lakewell.

56:07.420 --> 56:09.730
'I think it's best that you
go through him. L-A-K-E...'

56:09.780 --> 56:11.890
Mr Huntley, are you refusing to

56:11.940 --> 56:13.890
'cooperate with a lawful
police investigation?'

56:13.940 --> 56:16.610
'This is DS Arnott,
please leave a message.'

56:16.660 --> 56:19.770
Sarge, we got a reg on the car.

56:19.820 --> 56:24.050
It belongs to a Nicholas
Huntley -- Roz's husband.

56:24.100 --> 56:26.420
Maneet, just call him again.

56:28.740 --> 56:30.930
'This is DS Arnott,
please leave a message.'

56:30.980 --> 56:32.650
I'm outside your office.

56:32.700 --> 56:35.890
'Wouldn't it be better to
discuss all this face-to-face?'

56:35.940 --> 56:39.130
Listen, Mr Huntley, with
respect to the 17th of March,

56:39.180 --> 56:41.850
we've got strong circumstantial
evidence your wife wasn't at home

56:41.900 --> 56:45.650
- 'as she claims.'
- Erm, I've got no comment to make.

56:45.700 --> 56:48.410
I'm giving you the opportunity
to say something now before this

56:48.460 --> 56:50.930
gets extremely serious
not just for your wife,

56:50.980 --> 56:52.980
'but for you too, sir.'

56:55.140 --> 56:56.850
Steve, we need you to call in.

56:56.900 --> 56:58.810
Nick Huntley could be dangerous, OK.

56:58.860 --> 57:01.260
Nick Huntley could be dangerous. Call in.

57:03.420 --> 57:06.850
Please, you should talk to my solicitor.

57:06.900 --> 57:08.410
I'm going up to the 5th floor.

57:08.460 --> 57:11.180
'L-A-K-E-W-E-L-L.'

57:12.260 --> 57:14.210
Where did she claim she was that night?

57:14.260 --> 57:16.530
That night your kids left a
voicemail on your wife's phone

57:16.580 --> 57:18.490
asking permission to order a takeaway.

57:18.540 --> 57:21.050
If they're calling her, where were you?

57:21.100 --> 57:24.170
'I'm thinking you weren't
where you said you were.

57:24.220 --> 57:25.460
'Mr Huntley?'

57:26.660 --> 57:28.010
Think about your answer.

57:28.060 --> 57:30.260
You've got one minute. I'm on my way up.

57:33.220 --> 57:34.970
'Doors closing.

57:37.700 --> 57:42.490
'You have five new messages. Message one.'

57:42.540 --> 57:45.050
'Sarge, we got a reg on the car.

57:45.100 --> 57:47.290
It belongs to a Nicholas Huntley.

57:47.340 --> 57:48.980
'Doors opening.

57:57.780 --> 57:59.140
'Doors closing.
