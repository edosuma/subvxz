01:32.743 --> 01:34.871
After you.

01:40.539 --> 01:44.340
Is this 348?
Yes, it is.

01:44.411 --> 01:47.442
I've got a special delivery
here. That sounds interesting.

01:47.482 --> 01:50.680
It's for Dowd. Dowd's my name. Elwood P.

01:50.753 --> 01:53.550
Here, sir. Let me give you one of my cards.

01:53.590 --> 01:57.619
That won't be necessary.
Just sign right here. Uh-huh.

01:57.696 --> 02:02.191
Beautiful day. Every day's a beautiful day.

02:02.902 --> 02:05.133
Thank you.

02:06.374 --> 02:09.036
He was a nice man.

02:11.614 --> 02:13.583
Come on.

02:24.865 --> 02:27.391
Thank heavens
he's gone!

02:27.469 --> 02:29.831
Oh, Myrtle, it's
a wonderful feeling…

02:29.871 --> 02:33.202
to have your relative out of the
house before the company comes.

02:33.242 --> 02:36.374
You're sure Uncle Elwood won't
come back and spoil everything?

02:36.414 --> 02:39.678
Of course not, dear. Your uncle
always spends the afternoon…

02:39.718 --> 02:43.416
downtown at those filthy bars
and taverns, you know that.

02:43.456 --> 02:45.920
I'll go tell the cateress
to get started.

02:45.960 --> 02:48.690
Why, Miss Johnson, what
are you doing? Leaving.

02:48.730 --> 02:51.628
Miss Johnson, you were hired
to serve as well as cater.

02:51.668 --> 02:54.532
Our guests will be here any
minute. Now, Miss Johnson…

02:54.572 --> 02:57.836
Myrtle, let me handle this,
dear. Miss Johnson, what's wrong?

02:57.876 --> 03:01.174
There was a man here a minute ago
and he stopped and he spoke to me.

03:01.214 --> 03:05.445
You didn't tell him anything about our
party, did you? I didn't tell him nothin'!

03:05.485 --> 03:09.585
He gave me his card. Here. And
then he introduced me to somebody.

03:09.625 --> 03:13.562
To whom? Do you think I'd
stay in this house after that?

03:13.630 --> 03:16.930
Um, well…
Oh!

03:17.001 --> 03:21.534
People get run over by trucks every day.
Why can't that happen to Uncle Elwood?

03:21.574 --> 03:24.148
Myrtle Mae Simmons,
I'm ashamed of you!

03:24.177 --> 03:28.410
Even if people do call your uncle
peculiar, he is still my baby brother…

03:28.450 --> 03:31.421
and this is not his
fault. Whose fault is it?

03:31.487 --> 03:35.118
We'll get the cook to do the
serving. Come and lend me a hand.

03:35.158 --> 03:38.128
We haven't got much time.
Elvira!

03:38.196 --> 03:40.693
If it isn't his fault,
whose fault is it?

03:40.733 --> 03:46.071
I know whose fault it is, but I'm
not telling. You're not telling?

03:46.140 --> 03:48.541
Elvira?

03:48.610 --> 03:52.411
Elvira, you can bring
those things in now.

03:52.482 --> 03:54.912
Mother, why can't we live
like other people?

03:54.952 --> 03:56.914
Do I have
to keep reminding you…

03:56.954 --> 04:00.486
your Uncle Elwood is not living
with us, we're living with him?

04:00.526 --> 04:02.755
Living with him and his pal! You promised!

04:02.795 --> 04:06.756
–His pal Harvey!
–Oh, you said that name.

04:06.834 --> 04:10.531
You promised you wouldn't say
that name and you said it!

04:18.214 --> 04:21.481
Mother, why did grandmother leave
all her property to Uncle Elwood?

04:21.521 --> 04:24.450
I suppose it was because
she died in his arms.

04:24.491 --> 04:27.221
People are sentimental
about things like that.

04:27.261 --> 04:29.457
You always say that
and it doesn't make sense.

04:29.497 --> 04:33.897
She couldn't make out a will after
she died, could she? Don't be didactic.

04:33.937 --> 04:37.602
It's not becoming in a young
girl. Besides, men loathe it.

04:37.642 --> 04:39.634
Men! A fine chance
I've got!

04:39.712 --> 04:43.740
Dear, the whole idea of this
party this afternoon is to…

04:50.659 --> 04:54.992
Is to get you started socially, so
that you can meet some nice young men.

04:55.032 --> 04:57.398
What's the use?
Myrtle Mae Simmons,

04:57.468 --> 05:00.638
her uncle, Elwood P. Dowd,
is the biggest screw…

05:05.812 --> 05:09.112
Screwball in town!
Who'd want me?

05:09.183 --> 05:13.451
Myrtle, dear, you're sweet
and you have so much to offer.

05:13.523 --> 05:18.089
I don't care what anyone says, there's
something sweet about every young girl.

05:18.129 --> 05:21.594
And a man takes that sweetness
and look what he does with it!

05:21.634 --> 05:26.095
Oh, show some poise, dear. I
want you to charm Mrs Chauvenet.

05:26.173 --> 05:28.570
She has a grandson
just about your age.

05:28.610 --> 05:33.677
A lot of good that'll do if Uncle Elwood
comes home. Uncle Elwood won't be home.

05:33.717 --> 05:38.734
Or will he? I'm going to telephone
Judge Gaffney. We can't take any chances.

05:43.997 --> 05:46.626
Mother,
you better hurry!

05:46.700 --> 05:49.631
Mrs Halsey and Miss
Tewksbury are here already.

05:49.671 --> 05:52.402
Oh, dear.
Yes, dear, I am hurrying.

05:52.475 --> 05:55.072
Hurry, Mother. They're
getting out of the car.

05:55.112 --> 05:57.342
Oh…

06:03.089 --> 06:07.289
<i>Judge Gaffney, please.
Mrs Veta Simmons calling.</i>

06:11.366 --> 06:13.130
Yes?

06:13.203 --> 06:16.071
Oh, put her on.

06:16.140 --> 06:18.540
Veta, my girl,
this is a pleasure.

06:18.609 --> 06:20.672
Judge, we haven't got
a moment to lose.

06:20.712 --> 06:25.845
I'm having the Wednesday Forum over
for a program tea for Ethel Chauvenet.

06:25.919 --> 06:29.184
Elwood has just gone out, but
I'm so afraid he may come back.

06:29.224 --> 06:31.352
You can understand why.
Oh!

06:31.427 --> 06:34.363
Hello, Miss Tewksbury,
Mrs Halsey.

06:34.431 --> 06:38.493
Go right into the drawing room.
Myrtle, take their things.

06:38.569 --> 06:40.868
Yes, you've got to help me,
Judge.

06:40.939 --> 06:42.986
You've got to help me.
I can't…

06:43.009 --> 06:45.000
Speak up, Veta!

06:45.078 --> 06:49.847
What? I can't make out…
Is that so?

06:52.355 --> 06:56.690
Oh, yoo-hoo, Mrs Streickelberger.
Hello, Mrs Simmons.

07:02.501 --> 07:05.494
Oh, no, no, no.
Yes, that'll be all right.

07:05.572 --> 07:07.564
You can depend on me.

07:07.642 --> 07:09.873
All right.

07:12.181 --> 07:15.278
Minninger, in a few minutes, a
man will be crossing the square.

07:15.318 --> 07:18.182
He'll be wearing a hat and coat and
carrying another one over his arms.

07:18.222 --> 07:21.921
I want you to follow him. If necessary,
even confront him, quietly, of course.

07:21.961 --> 07:25.125
But at all events, I want you to
prevent him from returning to his house.

07:25.165 --> 07:28.563
His sister is giving a party. He wouldn't
fit in. His name is Elwood P. Dowd.

07:28.603 --> 07:31.400
Elwood Dowd, sir! Couldn't
you get someone else?

07:31.440 --> 07:34.204
Kratke maybe or Beck?
They're bigger than I am.

07:34.244 --> 07:38.442
You'll be able to hide better. Hurry and
stick with him all afternoon. Quickly, boy.

07:38.482 --> 07:41.884
Yes, sir.

07:43.856 --> 07:45.848
Oh, elevator!

07:50.265 --> 07:52.632
<i>Come in.</i>

07:54.737 --> 07:58.106
Yes?
Who is it?

07:59.577 --> 08:04.414
Oh! The doctor
will see you in a minute.

08:06.853 --> 08:09.584
Good afternoon, Mr Dowd. Howdy do?

08:26.013 --> 08:28.881
We must be
more careful.

08:36.592 --> 08:38.528
After you.

08:45.305 --> 08:47.880
How do, Mr Dowd? Afternoon, Mr Cracker.

08:47.941 --> 08:49.876
Excuse me.

08:49.944 --> 08:54.075
<i>How is he? Oh, he's just
fine, fine. How are you?</i>

08:54.150 --> 08:57.450
<i>Oh, can't complain.
That's good.</i>

08:59.424 --> 09:02.019
Is this all right?
You sure, hmm?

09:02.094 --> 09:07.159
Well, all right. Give you a hand
there. Whoop, don't slip! There.

09:07.234 --> 09:10.265
You sure this is all right? You
wouldn't rather sit in a booth?

09:10.305 --> 09:12.334
Well, all right. Would he prefer a booth?

09:12.374 --> 09:15.048
<i>Thank you, Mr Cracker. He
seems to prefer the bar today.</i>

09:15.088 --> 09:18.115
Good afternoon
to you, sir.

09:18.192 --> 09:21.219
Mr Meegles is back. Oh!

09:21.296 --> 09:24.232
Well!

09:24.300 --> 09:26.701
You…
Excuse me a minute.

09:26.770 --> 09:30.707
Mr Meegles, this is a
pleasure! We've missed you.

09:30.775 --> 09:32.710
How are you, Mr Dowd? Fine.

09:32.778 --> 09:35.942
And how is he? Oh, he's
splendid, thank you. Splendid.

09:35.982 --> 09:38.913
He decided he wanted to come over
here this afternoon, so here we are.

09:38.953 --> 09:43.051
Sit down. Oh, thank you. You've been away.

09:43.126 --> 09:47.894
For 90 days. Been doin' a job for
the state. Makin' license plates.

09:47.965 --> 09:50.799
Oh, is that so?
Interesting work?

09:50.869 --> 09:53.466
I can take it or leave it alone. Oh, I see.

09:53.506 --> 09:57.271
I did a job for 'em last year
too. Helpin' 'em build a road.

09:57.311 --> 10:01.477
Oh. Well, Mr Meegles, we'll just
have to do something about your return.

10:01.517 --> 10:04.548
Would you like to come to
my house for dinner tonight?

10:04.588 --> 10:07.552
Oh, thanks, Mr Dowd,
but I couldn't make it tonight.

10:07.592 --> 10:09.921
Ah, tomorrow night?
Would that suit you?

10:09.961 --> 10:13.330
Yes, yes! But you know,
the last time I was there…

10:13.399 --> 10:17.598
I kinda got the impression your sister held
it against me because I did a little time.

10:17.638 --> 10:21.871
Oh, no. My sister loves to
entertain. She's very social.

10:21.943 --> 10:26.882
Yes, I see by the papers. You know
I never miss the society column.

10:26.950 --> 10:30.081
You don't? No. She's giving
a clambake this afternoon.

10:30.121 --> 10:32.454
This afternoon?
Yeah.

10:32.525 --> 10:34.821
“Reception, program and tea,”
it says here,

10:34.861 --> 10:39.227
“for the members of the Wednesday Afternoon
Forum,” for that rich Mrs “Shuvanut.”

10:39.267 --> 10:42.601
Cheva… Yes,
that's Aunt Ethel.

10:42.671 --> 10:44.867
Is this today's paper?

10:44.941 --> 10:48.639
Veta didn't tell me anything about
this. Must've slipped her mind.

10:48.679 --> 10:53.175
Well, I'll see you tomorrow
night at 7:00, Mr Meegles, huh?

10:53.252 --> 10:57.087
Thanks, Mr Dowd. Very glad
to have seen you. Good-bye.

10:57.157 --> 10:59.649
Harvey,
I just found out…

10:59.727 --> 11:03.425
Now, what can I do for you?
What did you have in mind?

11:03.499 --> 11:05.434
What's your order?

11:05.502 --> 11:08.495
Two martinis.
Two martinis.

11:08.573 --> 11:13.808
Harvey, it seems that Veta is
having a party this afternoon.

11:13.880 --> 11:17.874
And I…
Hmm? Oh, you knew?

11:17.952 --> 11:21.016
Well, I just thought she might
be offended if we weren't there.

11:21.056 --> 11:26.018
After all, she's the only sister
I have and I… How's that?

11:26.096 --> 11:29.627
And the only one I'm ever likely to
have. Yes, you're absolutely right.

11:29.667 --> 11:31.898
We'd better hurry, huh?

11:31.971 --> 11:34.270
That'll be
four bits.

11:34.341 --> 11:39.575
The one at the end will pay
for it. Oh, he'd be delighted.

11:39.647 --> 11:42.310
He'd be delighted.

11:43.686 --> 11:47.384
Well…
let's drink up.

11:47.458 --> 11:50.661
My love

11:50.729 --> 11:55.828
Will take me flying
to the sky

11:55.903 --> 12:00.341
On a steed
with golden wings

12:00.408 --> 12:04.904
And then
we'll ride away

12:04.981 --> 12:08.816
<i>Forever high
on the moon</i>

12:08.886 --> 12:11.412
On a star
on a cloud

12:11.490 --> 12:14.858
In his arms

12:14.928 --> 12:18.729
I will stay

12:18.799 --> 12:23.932
<i>Ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh</i>

12:24.006 --> 12:26.441
<i>Ahh</i>

12:26.510 --> 12:30.811
Hop, hop, hop, hop hippity
hop on a golden steed

12:30.882 --> 12:35.082
Hop, hop, hop, hop hippity
hop Love is all I need

12:35.155 --> 12:37.214
<i>Ahh-ah, ahh-ah</i>

12:37.290 --> 12:41.092
Hop, hop, hop, hop hippity
hop on a golden steed

12:41.163 --> 12:47.764
Hop, hop, hop, hop hippity
hop Love is all I need

12:51.910 --> 12:53.902
Mother.
Shh-shh.

12:53.980 --> 12:57.917
Mrs Chauvenet is here.
Mrs Chauvenet is here? Oh.

12:57.985 --> 13:02.481
Aunt Ethel! Veta Louise
Simmons, I thought you were dead.

13:02.558 --> 13:06.188
Oh, no! I'm very much alive, thank you.

13:06.262 --> 13:08.359
And this is my daughter
Myrtle Mae.

13:08.399 --> 13:12.497
My dear, you're your grandmother
all over again. I was at her funeral.

13:12.537 --> 13:16.269
And now, where is Elwood?
Elwood couldn't be home.

13:16.342 --> 13:19.039
That's Miss Tewksbury singing.
She'll be through in a minute.

13:19.079 --> 13:22.712
Oh, shame on him! That was the main
reason I came. I want to see Elwood.

13:22.752 --> 13:25.348
Do you realize, Veta,
I haven't seen Elwood in years?

13:25.388 --> 13:29.884
I was saying to Mr Chauvenet…
What do you want, my dear?

13:29.961 --> 13:33.892
Just the other night, “What on earth
do you think happened to Elwood Dowd?

13:33.932 --> 13:36.629
”He never comes to
the Yale Alumni Dances anymore.

13:36.669 --> 13:39.834
I haven't seen him at the club
or the horse show in years.”

13:39.874 --> 13:42.207
Does Elwood see anybody
these days?

13:42.277 --> 13:46.109
Yes, Aunt Ethel, Elwood sees
somebody. Yes, Aunt Ethel, he does.

13:46.149 --> 13:48.584
Is Elwood happy,
Veta Louise?

13:48.652 --> 13:53.853
Oh, yes, Aunt Ethel, Elwood's
very happy. You mustn't worry.

13:53.926 --> 13:57.021
There's Mrs Cummings.
She's waving at you.

13:57.097 --> 14:01.095
Is that Mrs Frank Cummings? Doesn't
she look ghastly? I thought she was dead.

14:01.135 --> 14:04.230
<i>I must get a closer look.</i>

14:04.306 --> 14:07.333
We can go in now. What did I do with my…

14:07.410 --> 14:09.743
Oh, there it is.

14:11.416 --> 14:12.974
Oh, no!

14:15.922 --> 14:20.918
Elwood! Elwood Dowd!
Bless your heart!

14:20.995 --> 14:23.089
Aunt Ethel.
What a pleasure…

14:23.165 --> 14:27.130
to find a beautiful woman waiting
for me. Elwood, you haven't changed.

14:27.170 --> 14:28.729
Elwood!

14:28.806 --> 14:31.274
Well, you both
look lovely.

14:31.342 --> 14:36.680
Some mail came for you. It looked
important so I put it up in your room.

14:36.749 --> 14:38.846
Did you, Veta?
That was nice of you.

14:38.886 --> 14:41.249
Aunt Ethel, I'd like to have
you meet a very dear…

14:41.289 --> 14:44.487
Aunt Ethel, don't you want some
tea? Not just now, thank you.

14:44.527 --> 14:46.657
There's punch if you don't
like tea. But I do like tea.

14:46.697 --> 14:49.188
Stop pulling me,
you two.

14:49.266 --> 14:53.265
Elwood, what night next week can you come
to dinner? You and Veta and Myrtle Mae?

14:53.305 --> 14:56.036
I'll have Ordway there.
Ordway is my grandson.

14:56.076 --> 14:59.974
Any night at all, I'd be
delighted. I'd like to meet Ordway.

15:00.014 --> 15:03.917
And now, Aunt Ethel,
I'd like you to meet Harvey!

15:03.986 --> 15:07.283
<i>Harvey, you've heard me speak of Aunt
Ethel Chauvenet. One of my dearest friends.</i>

15:07.323 --> 15:10.020
She's the one who…
Hmm?

15:10.094 --> 15:14.760
Th-That's right. Well, this
is the one. No, she's the one!

15:17.171 --> 15:20.471
She… He says he would've
known you anywhere.

15:20.542 --> 15:24.639
Well, now we must go in and
greet the rest of our friends.

15:24.713 --> 15:26.705
Come along, Harvey.

15:26.783 --> 15:30.311
Oh, Aunt Ethel,
will you pardon me?

15:30.388 --> 15:33.290
You're standing
in his way.

15:33.992 --> 15:36.757
There we are.

15:36.829 --> 15:38.798
I'll see you in a minute.

15:38.866 --> 15:43.566
I can see that you're disturbed
about Harvey. Please don't be.

15:43.638 --> 15:46.569
He stares that way at
everybody. It's his way.

15:46.609 --> 15:50.172
But he likes you, I can
tell. He likes you very much.

15:50.248 --> 15:53.082
I'm, I'm coming, Harvey.

15:53.152 --> 15:55.883
Well, I… I think
I'll be running along.

15:55.956 --> 15:58.584
No tea? Or punch? No, no. Thank you.

15:58.658 --> 16:01.255
Perhaps a nice lemon fizz…
I'll be going. Good-bye.

16:01.295 --> 16:04.493
With a turkey wing
and some walnut dressing?

16:06.402 --> 16:08.394
Oh, no!

16:08.472 --> 16:12.207
Elwood.

16:13.044 --> 16:15.980
Oh, no.
Not Mrs Halsey.

16:16.048 --> 16:19.605
She has a nephew. He's a little bit
old, but he would have done in a pinch.

16:19.645 --> 16:23.710
She has a nephew. He's a little bit
old, but he would have done in a pinch.

16:23.750 --> 16:26.480
Oh, Mother, I can't face
those people. I just can't!

16:26.520 --> 16:32.021
Your uncle has disgraced us for the last
time in this house. I'm going to see to that.

16:32.061 --> 16:34.590
You're no match for him.
He always gets the best of you.

16:34.630 --> 16:36.627
Where are you going? Upstairs to pack.

16:36.667 --> 16:40.198
I'm going to lose myself in some strange
city. I'm going to change my name!

16:40.238 --> 16:42.173
Don't do that yet,
dear!

16:42.241 --> 16:45.769
Wait until I telephone
Judge Gaff… Judge Gaffney.

16:45.846 --> 16:49.807
I'm going to do something
I should've done long ago.

16:51.553 --> 16:56.390
I don't understand it, Veta. Mr
Minninger is as trustworthy as the Bible.

16:56.460 --> 16:58.890
I don't know anything about
your Mr Minninger.

16:58.930 --> 17:03.963
But I do know Elwood Dowd when I see
him and he's here. He's here, I tell you.

17:04.002 --> 17:09.534
If you insist he's there, then I must
act on the assumption that he's there.

17:09.611 --> 17:11.978
Minninger!
You failed!

17:12.047 --> 17:14.881
I didn't fail, Judge.
I haven't tried yet.

17:14.951 --> 17:16.646
I've been in
the doctor's office.

17:16.685 --> 17:19.781
Oh, excuse me.
Hold on, Judge.

17:19.858 --> 17:22.320
<i>Mrs Halsey, Mrs Krausmeyer.
You're not leaving, are you?</i>

17:22.361 --> 17:25.191
I just remembered the horse show
is today. Good-bye. It's been jolly.

17:25.231 --> 17:27.595
<i>Won't you join us
tomorrow night?</i>

17:27.635 --> 17:30.966
Harvey and I are having a
few people in for Mr Meegles.

17:31.006 --> 17:34.470
Forgive me, Mrs Simmons. One of my
stupid headaches. Such a lovely party.

17:34.510 --> 17:36.570
Good-bye, good-bye.

17:36.647 --> 17:39.116
Elwood, I'd like to talk…

17:39.184 --> 17:41.153
W-W-W…

17:41.220 --> 17:44.315
There.
There we are.

17:44.391 --> 17:48.122
I'd like to talk to you, Elwood.
I like to talk to you too.

17:48.162 --> 17:51.860
This is very important. Would
you mind coming into the library?

17:51.900 --> 17:54.199
Oh, of course, Veta.

17:54.270 --> 17:58.640
Elwood, I want
to talk to you.

17:58.709 --> 18:01.908
Oh!

18:01.981 --> 18:06.078
I want you to wait here.
Don't move. I'll be right back.

18:06.153 --> 18:09.651
Certainly, sister. I happen
to have a little free time now.

18:09.691 --> 18:12.688
You're welcome to all of it,
Veta. Want Harvey to wait too?

18:12.728 --> 18:16.324
Oh, yes! Yes, Elwood.
I certainly do.

18:16.399 --> 18:18.561
Hello! Speak up, I say.

18:18.636 --> 18:20.599
Did you say something,
Harvey? Who said that?

18:20.639 --> 18:23.536
Veta Louise, are you there?
Are you there, girl?

18:23.576 --> 18:25.806
Hello? Veta?

18:25.879 --> 18:27.848
Hello.
Who is it please?

18:27.915 --> 18:32.513
Oh, Judge, I'm so glad you
called. I was going to call you.

18:32.588 --> 18:35.319
Oh, um… Omar,

18:35.392 --> 18:38.323
we've got to take those steps
we discussed once.

18:38.363 --> 18:41.334
Yes. I want you to make
all the arrangements.

18:41.400 --> 18:44.268
Yes.
By all means, yes.

18:44.337 --> 18:47.401
That was Omar. We've been
neglecting the Judge lately.

18:47.441 --> 18:50.939
Veta, do you know that it's been weeks
since Harvey and I've been up to his office?

18:50.979 --> 18:55.974
Let's go tomorrow, shall we?
Elwood, you and I may take a ride.

18:56.053 --> 19:00.388
Oh, I'd like that! Only
the other day Harvey said,

19:00.458 --> 19:03.523
“It's certainly been a long time
since we've been for a drive.”

19:03.563 --> 19:09.299
You're sweet and thoughtful. Don't
forget to wait for me. I'll be right back.

19:11.005 --> 19:15.467
Make yourself comfortable,
Harvey.

19:15.545 --> 19:18.709
There.
All right?

19:19.784 --> 19:22.015
Veta wants to talk to us.

19:22.087 --> 19:26.321
She, uh,
says it's very important.

19:26.393 --> 19:30.421
I think she wants
to congratulate us…

19:30.498 --> 19:33.366
on the impression we made
at her party.

19:36.073 --> 19:40.977
<i>Jane Austin.
Sense and Sensibility.</i>

19:42.548 --> 19:45.848
Hmm?
Oh…

19:45.919 --> 19:48.514
Random House.

19:48.589 --> 19:52.082
No, deluxe edition.

19:52.160 --> 19:54.186
Usual acknowledgments.

19:55.498 --> 19:58.059
Chapter One.

19:58.135 --> 20:02.233
“The family of Dashwood had
been long settled in Sussex…”

20:22.901 --> 20:25.231
Will you wait here for me,
Elwood, dear?

20:25.271 --> 20:29.676
You want both of us to
wait? Oh, yes, both of you.

20:33.449 --> 20:35.816
I won't be long.

20:35.886 --> 20:39.584
Driver, driver, will you
keep an eye on him, please?

20:39.657 --> 20:42.627
I won't be but a minute.

20:48.436 --> 20:52.931
Charming place, isn't
it, Harvey? Name's Henry.

20:53.008 --> 20:56.707
It's Henry, Harvey.
No, just plain Henry.

20:56.780 --> 21:01.150
Hmm, oh!
My name's Dowd, Elwood P.

21:01.219 --> 21:05.555
Let me give you one
of my cards.

21:05.625 --> 21:09.123
If you should ever want to
call me, call me at this number.

21:09.163 --> 21:13.032
Don't call me at that one.
That's the old one.

21:13.102 --> 21:17.328
If you happen to lose the card,
don't worry, I have plenty more.

21:22.447 --> 21:25.445
Mrs O.R. Simmons. 348
Temple Drive. Is that right?

21:25.485 --> 21:27.886
Yes. We were born
and raised there.

21:27.955 --> 21:30.596
It's old, but we love it.
It's our home.

21:30.658 --> 21:33.489
And you wish to enter your brother
at the sanitarium for treatment?

21:33.529 --> 21:37.296
What is your brother's
name? It's… Oh, dear.

21:37.367 --> 21:40.098
Mrs Simmons,
what is your brother's name?

21:40.171 --> 21:44.542
I'm sorry. Life is
not easy for any of us.

21:44.611 --> 21:47.513
It's Dowd.
Elwood P. Dowd.

21:47.581 --> 21:50.483
Elwood P. Dowd.
His age?

21:50.552 --> 21:53.989
Forty-two
the 24th of last April.

21:54.056 --> 21:56.423
He's Taurus,
Taurus the bull.

21:56.493 --> 22:00.555
I'm Leo, and Myrtle's on the
cusp. You have him with you now?

22:00.632 --> 22:03.659
Oh, yes. He's outside
waiting in a taxi cab.

22:03.736 --> 22:06.466
I told him to wait. He
always does what I tell him.

22:06.506 --> 22:09.504
I see. Is he married?
No, Elwood never married.

22:09.544 --> 22:14.779
He always stayed with
Mother. He loved his home.

22:14.851 --> 22:18.185
Yeah? Wilson, there's a
Mr Dowd outside in a cab.

22:18.255 --> 22:22.988
Will you ask him if he'll be good enough
to step up to room 24 South Wing “G”?

22:23.028 --> 22:26.796
Ask him? Wilson, this is
his sister, Mrs Simmons.

22:26.867 --> 22:28.801
Oh, how do?

22:28.869 --> 22:32.705
Why certainly.
I'll be glad to escort him.

22:32.775 --> 22:35.839
I'll see if Dr Sanderson
can see you, Mrs Simmons.

22:35.879 --> 22:39.577
Dr Sanderson? I want to
see Dr Chumley himself.

22:39.650 --> 22:43.682
Dr Sanderson is the one who sees
everybody. Dr Chumley sees no one.

22:43.722 --> 22:46.385
<i>I'll tell him
you're here.</i>

22:55.042 --> 22:59.309
I-Isn't this wonderful, Veta? Okay, buddy!

23:05.690 --> 23:08.626
Oh, you startled me!

23:08.694 --> 23:11.731
I'm sorry, Mrs Simmons.
I am Dr Sanderson. Oh.

23:11.798 --> 23:16.397
Miss Kelly tells me you're concerned
about your brother, Mister, uh, Mister…

23:16.437 --> 23:18.633
The card, Miss Kelly.

23:18.707 --> 23:22.269
Miss Kelly!
The card, please.

23:22.344 --> 23:25.644
Mr Dowd? Elwood P. Dowd. This way.

23:25.716 --> 23:28.914
I'm sorry if I awakened you,
Miss Kelly.

23:30.889 --> 23:33.484
I'm so…

23:33.560 --> 23:37.827
I do hope you don't think
I'm always as jumpy as this.

23:37.898 --> 23:40.197
This is not easy for me,
Doctor.

23:40.268 --> 23:43.066
These things aren't easy
for the family. I understand.

23:43.106 --> 23:46.042
Won't you sit down,
Miss Simmons? Thank you.

23:46.110 --> 23:50.475
How long has it been since you first noticed
any peculiarity in your brother's actions?

23:50.515 --> 23:53.577
As a baby,
he was perfectly normal.

23:53.653 --> 23:57.152
I know. I was his big sister
and I had to change him.

23:57.225 --> 23:59.717
Babies do need changing,
you know.

23:59.795 --> 24:03.664
I noticed that he seemed
to be different…

24:03.733 --> 24:06.498
after we came back
after Mother had died.

24:06.570 --> 24:09.935
Myrtle Mae and I came back from
Des Moines to live with Elwood.

24:09.975 --> 24:12.843
I could see that he…

24:12.912 --> 24:15.006
That he…
That he what?

24:15.082 --> 24:17.574
Take your time.
Don't strain.

24:17.652 --> 24:20.622
Just, just let it come.
I'll wait for it.

24:20.689 --> 24:25.150
Doctor, everything I say to
you is confidential, isn't it?

24:25.228 --> 24:29.097
I am not a gossip. I am
a psychiatrist. Of course.

24:29.167 --> 24:33.367
For one thing, he
drinks. Mm-hmm. To excess?

24:33.439 --> 24:35.407
To excess?

24:35.475 --> 24:39.371
Don't you call it excess when
a man never lets a day go by…

24:39.414 --> 24:42.145
without stepping
into some cheap tavern,

24:42.218 --> 24:45.616
bringing home a lot of riffraff,
people you never heard of?

24:45.656 --> 24:50.288
If you don't call that excess, Doctor,
I'm sure I don't know what excess is.

24:50.328 --> 24:52.820
I didn't doubt
your statement.

24:52.898 --> 24:55.162
I merely wanted to know
if your brother drinks.

24:55.202 --> 24:58.536
Yes, I say definitely
Elwood drinks. Mm-hmm.

24:58.606 --> 25:01.270
I want him committed
out here permanently…

25:01.310 --> 25:05.077
because I cannot stand
another day of that Harvey!

25:05.148 --> 25:07.711
Don't you think it would have been
a little bit kinder of Mother…

25:07.751 --> 25:11.518
if she'd written us about
him. Now, be honest. Don't you?

25:11.590 --> 25:14.720
I really couldn't answer
that question. I can!

25:14.795 --> 25:17.320
Yes, it certainly
would have.

25:17.397 --> 25:20.390
This person
that you call Harvey,

25:20.468 --> 25:23.563
<i>who is he?
He's a rabbit.</i>

25:23.639 --> 25:27.077
Yes, perhaps.
But just who is he?

25:27.144 --> 25:29.340
<i>Someone your brother picked up
in one of these bars?</i>

25:29.380 --> 25:32.316
I've been telling you,
Harvey is a rabbit!

25:32.384 --> 25:36.817
A big white rabbit six feet high,
or is it six feet, three and a half?

25:36.857 --> 25:40.388
Heaven knows, I ought to know. He's
been around the house long enough!

25:40.428 --> 25:44.327
<i>Mrs Simmons, if I'm not
mistaken… Don't you understand?</i>

25:44.367 --> 25:46.859
<i>The rabbit's name
is Harvey.</i>

25:46.937 --> 25:49.805
Harvey lives
at our house.

25:49.874 --> 25:54.506
Elwood buys theater tickets and
railroad tickets for both of them.

25:54.581 --> 25:56.844
<i>He's lost interest
in everything else.</i>

25:56.884 --> 26:00.787
And here I am trying to get
Myrtle Mae started…

26:00.856 --> 26:04.122
with a nice group
of young people.

26:04.193 --> 26:06.287
<i>That's my daughter.</i>

26:06.363 --> 26:08.354
Doctor,

26:08.432 --> 26:12.988
I'm going to tell you something
I've never told anyone in this world.

26:13.039 --> 26:15.133
Not even Myrtle Mae.

26:15.208 --> 26:20.146
Every once in a while, I see
this big white rabbit myself!

26:20.214 --> 26:22.206
Isn't that terrible!

26:22.284 --> 26:26.182
And what's more, he's every
bit as big as Elwood says he is!

26:26.222 --> 26:31.719
Don't ever tell that to anybody,
Doctor. I'm ashamed of it.

26:31.797 --> 26:35.896
I can see that you've been under
a great nervous strain lately.

26:35.936 --> 26:40.772
You just try living with those two
and see how much of a strain it is.

26:40.842 --> 26:43.272
Your mother's death, it
depressed you considerably.

26:43.312 --> 26:45.440
Nobody knows how much.

26:45.515 --> 26:50.783
Don't you worry. I'm going
to help you. Oh, Doctor!

26:52.691 --> 26:55.126
Miss Kelly. Miss Kelly!

26:55.195 --> 26:58.029
Wilson? Wilson!

26:58.099 --> 27:01.663
Don't you move. You just sit there
and make yourself comfortable.

27:01.703 --> 27:03.968
I'll only be a minute. Yes.

27:04.040 --> 27:07.033
Wilson? Wilson!

27:08.312 --> 27:10.543
Hello?

27:12.752 --> 27:17.884
Lady, you told me to keep an eye on that
fella, but a big guy in a white coat came…

27:17.925 --> 27:20.433
That's quite all right.
You just wait.

27:20.461 --> 27:23.425
Do you want I should do
something about his suitcase?

27:23.465 --> 27:27.426
Oh, Elwood's things. Yes, I
better come get them, I guess.

27:27.505 --> 27:32.341
He might need them. Oh dear, it would
be awful if he should get hurt and…

27:32.411 --> 27:35.408
She picked a fine time to leave her desk
just when I've got a new patient in my office.

27:35.448 --> 27:39.011
Mrs Simmons?
Mrs Simmons!

27:39.087 --> 27:42.351
Sound the gong. That poor woman mustn't
leave the grounds. Made a getaway, huh, Doc?

27:42.391 --> 27:47.672
Her condition is serious. Go after her
and take her to 13 Upper West “R.” Right.

27:50.969 --> 27:54.067
Where is she? That little dame
that just came out, where'd she go?

27:54.107 --> 27:57.204
She's picking some posies. She wants
to bring 'em to somebody inside.

27:57.244 --> 27:59.573
Mac, is it safe for me
to wait around?

27:59.613 --> 28:02.711
I don't see no bars on these
windows. Don't need 'em.

28:02.751 --> 28:08.033
Anybody tries to climb through those
windows will sound like a three-alarm fire.

28:08.792 --> 28:12.389
Hello, sweetheart.
Well, well. Those for me?

28:12.465 --> 28:15.429
For you? I should say not.
They're for my brother Elwood.

28:15.469 --> 28:18.098
He's devoted to ranunculus. Sure.

28:18.172 --> 28:21.370
Wouldn't you like to come inside
and pick some off the wallpaper?

28:21.410 --> 28:23.772
No, thank you. These
will do nicely. Good day.

28:23.812 --> 28:26.805
Lady. Come, lady. Now, really, I…

28:26.883 --> 28:31.219
There's a man inside wants to
talk to you. No, I don't… No!

28:31.289 --> 28:34.817
No! You let me go! Help. Help! Police!

28:34.894 --> 28:37.791
What do we want with the police,
love boat? They're no fun.

28:37.831 --> 28:41.262
You let me go! I'm a respectable
woman! That's for sure.

28:41.302 --> 28:44.767
Come on, lady, be nice or I'll
have to pick you up and carry you.

28:44.807 --> 28:48.540
Help!

28:58.526 --> 29:00.859
Oh, Dr Sanderson!
Judge Gaffney!

29:00.929 --> 29:03.392
How about giving me a hand,
beautiful?

29:03.432 --> 29:05.695
I'll sit on her.
You can strip her clothes off.

29:05.735 --> 29:08.499
You'll have to wait. I've got
to give some guy a bubble bath.

29:08.539 --> 29:10.906
Okay, honey,
but make it snappy.

29:10.975 --> 29:14.537
Somebody help me!

29:27.498 --> 29:32.300
Doc, that Simmons dame's all
set. Yeah, no trouble at all.

29:32.504 --> 29:36.136
That's fine. I'll be right up and
prescribe some preliminary treatment.

29:36.176 --> 29:39.974
Don't you ever stay in your office?
I needed you! I had to give a hypo.

29:40.014 --> 29:43.512
Telephone this Elwood P. Dowd right
away. His sister's condition is serious.

29:43.552 --> 29:46.550
But, Doctor, I… He'll have to
sign these commitment papers for her.

29:46.590 --> 29:49.320
I didn't know the woman needed the
treatment. She said it was her brother.

29:49.360 --> 29:51.490
Of course she did! That's
the oldest dodge in the world.

29:51.530 --> 29:53.592
Always used by
a cunning type of psychopath.

29:53.632 --> 29:56.563
She knew her brother was about to commit
her, so she came here to discredit him.

29:56.603 --> 30:00.034
Get him on the phone, please. I
thought the woman was all right…

30:00.074 --> 30:03.842
so I had Wilson take the
brother up to 24 South Wing “G.”

30:03.913 --> 30:06.777
He's there now. You had
Wilson take the brother in?

30:06.817 --> 30:09.948
Come on, no gags, please.
You're not serious, are you?

30:09.988 --> 30:14.983
I did, Doctor. I did.
Doctor, I'm terribly sorry.

30:15.060 --> 30:18.759
Oh, you're terribly sorry! Well,
that's fine! That fixes everything!

30:18.799 --> 30:20.790
That's just wonderful!

30:20.868 --> 30:25.967
Oh, no! Kelly! Kelly, do
you realize what you've done?

30:26.042 --> 30:29.907
This man Dowd can sue us for false
commitment! He can own the sanitarium!

30:29.947 --> 30:33.541
And I'll be kicked outta here faster than you
can say “stupid, incompetent and inefficient.”

30:33.581 --> 30:36.812
I'll tell Dr Chumley you had nothing
to do with it. It was all my fault.

30:36.852 --> 30:39.883
You're the last person I'd ever
want anything like this to happen to.

30:39.923 --> 30:41.891
You know that,
don't you?

30:41.958 --> 30:45.857
<i>This is hardly the time or place to go into
the balcony scene from Romeo and Juliet.</i>

30:45.897 --> 30:48.294
Lately, Doctor, there's
never any time or place!

30:48.334 --> 30:51.932
Jeepers! They may be putting him in
the hydro room right now. Get him down!

30:51.972 --> 30:54.435
I'll break the news to Dr
Chumley. He may want to handle this.

30:54.475 --> 30:56.504
What shall I say to Mr Dowd?
What'll I do?

30:56.544 --> 30:59.208
He'll probably be so furious
he'll refuse to come down.

30:59.248 --> 31:02.179
He's probably fit to be tied,
but he's a man, isn't he?

31:02.219 --> 31:04.552
I guess so.
His name is “Mister.”

31:04.622 --> 31:08.453
Then go into your routine. You
know, the eyes, the swish, the works!

31:08.493 --> 31:11.324
I'm immune to it, but I've seen it work
on some people. Some of the patients!

31:11.364 --> 31:14.461
You get him down here
if you have to do a striptease.

31:14.501 --> 31:18.029
Dr Chumley, I'm afraid
there's been a serious error.

31:18.106 --> 31:21.942
Dr Sanderson, we don't permit
errors in this institution.

31:30.857 --> 31:32.791
Mr Dowd?

31:34.061 --> 31:37.327
Elwood P. Here, let me
give you one of my cards.

31:37.399 --> 31:40.763
Mr Dowd, I'm Miss Kelly. I'm
at the reception desk downstairs.

31:40.803 --> 31:43.601
I'm happy to know you, Miss
Kelly. Thank you, Mr Dowd.

31:43.641 --> 31:47.339
I was wondering if you would come
downstairs with me to Dr Sanderson's office.

31:47.379 --> 31:51.310
There's something he'd like to
explain to you. Uh-huh. I'd be glad to.

31:51.350 --> 31:56.217
But there was another very charming
girl in here. And she asked me to wait.

31:56.257 --> 31:58.370
She said something
about a bath.

31:58.394 --> 32:02.859
I don't like to disappoint her. She
seemed to have her heart set on it.

32:02.899 --> 32:05.296
That was Miss Dunphy.
It's quite all right, Mr Dowd.

32:05.336 --> 32:07.933
Dr Sanderson will explain everything
in his office. Well, here we are.

32:07.973 --> 32:10.136
Tsk-tsk. Mr Dowd,
you haven't peeled yet.

32:10.176 --> 32:15.240
And I regret this, but Miss Kelly
seems to want me to go with her.

32:15.316 --> 32:18.246
Miss Kelly, you've met
Miss Dunphy? Yes, of course.

32:18.286 --> 32:22.986
I want you to meet a very dear… There's
been a mistake. Just forget everything.

32:23.026 --> 32:28.557
I have a suggestion. Why don't I do
what she wants, and then go with you?

32:28.634 --> 32:32.867
That won't be necessary, Mr
Dowd. All right. Good-bye, my dear.

32:32.939 --> 32:35.602
You could've had
a bath too.

32:35.676 --> 32:40.510
I've already had a bath. Oh, I wasn't
speaking to you. I was speaking to my fr…

32:40.550 --> 32:45.854
Mr Dowd, I take a bath every
morning just before I go on duty.

32:45.924 --> 32:49.520
It's always such a pleasant way
to start the day.

32:50.296 --> 32:52.765
Oh, after you.

33:01.911 --> 33:04.710
Mr Dowd?
Elwood P.

33:04.782 --> 33:07.479
Let me give you one
of my cards.

33:07.552 --> 33:10.616
I am Dr Lyman Sanderson, Dr
Chumley's assistant. And I…

33:10.656 --> 33:13.990
Good for you! Happy to know you. Yes.

33:14.061 --> 33:18.123
I asked Miss Kelly to bring you
down here… Isn't she lovely?

33:18.199 --> 33:20.498
You're very lovely,
my dear.

33:20.569 --> 33:24.837
Why thank you! Some people
don't seem to think so.

33:24.909 --> 33:28.073
Well, some people are blind. That's
very often brought to my attention.

33:28.113 --> 33:31.611
I'd like both of you to meet a very dear
friend of mine… Why can't we sit down?

33:31.651 --> 33:34.952
Won't you have a chair?
Well, thank you very much.

33:34.955 --> 33:37.857
There we are.

33:37.926 --> 33:39.989
Please, sit down.
After Miss Kelly.

33:40.029 --> 33:44.695
No, really, Mr Dowd. I couldn't. I'm
in and out. But you sit down, please.

33:44.735 --> 33:47.500
After you.
Sit down, Kelly!

33:50.843 --> 33:53.974
Anything we can do for you, Mr
Dowd? What did you have in mind?

33:54.014 --> 33:57.780
Is your chair comfortable? Is the
chair quite comfortable, Mr Dowd?

33:57.820 --> 34:01.284
Yes. Care to try it? No, no, no,
thank you. How 'bout a cigarette?

34:01.324 --> 34:04.055
No, thank you.
Yes, a cigarette…

34:05.796 --> 34:08.960
Mr Dowd, you have us
at a disadvantage here.

34:09.034 --> 34:12.532
You know it and we know it, so
let's lay our cards on the table.

34:12.572 --> 34:14.507
That appeals
to me, Doctor.

34:14.574 --> 34:18.741
Best thing in the long run. People
are people no matter where you go.

34:18.781 --> 34:20.873
That is very often
the case.

34:20.949 --> 34:23.943
And being human,
are liable to make mistakes.

34:24.020 --> 34:28.887
Miss Kelly and I, we've made a mistake
this afternoon and we'd like to explain it.

34:28.927 --> 34:32.226
The truth is… You and Miss Kelly here?

34:32.297 --> 34:34.290
Yes.

34:34.368 --> 34:37.338
Out here this afternoon? Yes, Mr Dowd.

34:37.405 --> 34:40.603
We hope you'll understand. Oh, yes, yes.

34:40.676 --> 34:44.574
These things are often the basis
of a very long, warm friendship.

34:44.614 --> 34:47.608
It wasn't Dr Sanderson's
fault. It was mine.

34:47.685 --> 34:50.210
No, the responsibility
is all mine!

34:50.289 --> 34:55.388
Your attitude may be old-fashioned,
but I like it very much.

34:57.398 --> 34:59.795
Of course, If I had seen
your sister first,

34:59.835 --> 35:02.938
this would've been
an entirely different story.

35:03.006 --> 35:04.975
There you surprise me.

35:05.042 --> 35:08.874
I think the world and all of Veta,
but I had supposed she'd seen her day.

35:08.914 --> 35:13.819
You mustn't attach too much blame
to her. She's a very sick woman.

35:13.887 --> 35:18.219
She came in here insisting that you needed
treatment. That's perfectly ridiculous.

35:18.259 --> 35:21.557
Veta shouldn't be upset
about me. I get along fine.

35:21.597 --> 35:25.663
She was extremely upset and plunged right
away into a heated tirade about your drinking.

35:25.703 --> 35:28.468
Ahh!
That was Veta.

35:28.540 --> 35:32.501
I tell Veta not to worry about
that. I'll take care of that.

35:32.545 --> 35:35.709
Exactly! Oh, I suppose that you take a
drink now and then like the rest of us.

35:35.749 --> 35:38.651
M-M-M-M…

35:40.056 --> 35:42.081
Yes, yes I do, Doctor.

35:42.158 --> 35:45.686
As a matter of fact,
I'd like one right now.

35:45.762 --> 35:48.596
As a matter of fact,
so would I.

35:48.666 --> 35:51.865
But her reaction to the whole
matter was entirely too intense.

35:51.905 --> 35:53.873
Does she drink, Mr Dowd?

35:53.940 --> 35:58.572
Oh, no, oh, no. I don't think
Veta's ever taken a drink.

35:58.647 --> 36:01.911
I am going to surprise you. I
think she has and does constantly.

36:01.951 --> 36:05.251
She… Is that…

36:05.322 --> 36:09.657
Well, I certainly
am surprised at that.

36:09.728 --> 36:13.291
Her alcoholism isn't
the basis for my diagnosis.

36:13.367 --> 36:18.305
It was when she became so emotional
about this big white rabbit Harvey.

36:18.373 --> 36:22.311
Yes, I believe she called
him Harvey. Harvey's his name!

36:22.379 --> 36:25.548
Doctor, before we go any
further, I must insist…

36:25.616 --> 36:27.845
that you and Miss Kelly allow me
to introduce you to a friend…

36:27.886 --> 36:30.150
Let me make my point.

36:30.222 --> 36:33.955
I think your sister's condition
stems from trauma.

36:34.028 --> 36:37.556
From what? Trauma.
Spelled T-R-A-U-M-A.

36:37.632 --> 36:40.062
It means shock. There's
nothing unusual about it.

36:40.102 --> 36:42.562
There's the birth trauma,
or the shock of being born.

36:42.602 --> 36:46.472
<i>That's the one
we never get over.</i>

36:46.541 --> 36:50.673
You have a very nice sense of humor.
Hasn't he, Miss Kelly? Oh, he certainly has!

36:50.713 --> 36:53.376
May I say the same
for both of you?

36:53.450 --> 36:57.683
<i>Your sister's condition is
serious, but I can help her.</i>

36:57.755 --> 36:59.985
She must, however, remain
out here temporarily.

37:00.025 --> 37:04.058
Uh-huh. Well, I've always wanted Veta
to have everything she needs. Exactly!

37:04.098 --> 37:07.996
But I wouldn't want her to stay here
unless she likes it and wants to stay here.

37:08.036 --> 37:12.368
If this were an ordinary delusion on the
memory picture, that would be one thing.

37:12.408 --> 37:14.389
But this is
much more serious.

37:14.445 --> 37:18.410
It stands to reason no one has ever
seen a white rabbit six feet high.

37:18.450 --> 37:20.578
Not very often,
Doctor.

37:20.653 --> 37:22.749
So she must be committed
here temporarily.

37:22.789 --> 37:25.486
Under the circumstances, I'd
commit my own grandmother.

37:25.526 --> 37:27.790
Does your grandmother
drink too?

37:27.862 --> 37:31.095
That's just an expression.

37:31.167 --> 37:34.398
Here are the commitment papers for you
to sign, and here's a visitor's pass.

37:34.438 --> 37:36.434
You can come and see her
whenever you like.

37:36.474 --> 37:39.273
I think you better
have Veta do this.

37:39.344 --> 37:43.043
She always does all the signing and
managing for our family. She's good at it.

37:43.083 --> 37:46.248
<i>I'll have your family lawyer
take care of it. Judge Gaffney.</i>

37:46.288 --> 37:48.416
He's already telephoned us in
connection with this matter.

37:48.456 --> 37:50.448
Is that so?
Yes.

37:50.526 --> 37:53.826
I like you, Dowd. Well,
I like you too, Doctor.

37:53.897 --> 37:56.992
And Miss Kelly here.
I certainly do like you.

37:57.068 --> 37:59.833
Why, thank you,
Mr Dowd.

37:59.905 --> 38:04.139
You two have been so pleasant,
why don't we keep on going?

38:04.211 --> 38:06.874
I'd like to invite you
to come downtown with me…

38:06.914 --> 38:10.346
and we'll go to this charming little place
called Charlie's and we'll have a drink.

38:10.386 --> 38:13.447
Oh, I'm sorry,
but we're on duty now.

38:13.524 --> 38:16.321
Give us a rain check. Some
other time, we'd be glad to.

38:16.361 --> 38:20.162
When? Well, I can't say offhand.

38:20.232 --> 38:22.429
Miss Kelly and I are
on duty until 10:00 tonight.

38:22.469 --> 38:25.867
10:00 will be fine. I'll be waiting
for you. It's at Twelfth and Main.

38:25.907 --> 38:28.137
If we can make it.
I'll be waiting.

38:28.177 --> 38:31.574
The four of us will spend a
very pleasant evening together.

38:31.614 --> 38:34.812
I want both of you to become friends
with a very dear friend of mine.

38:34.852 --> 38:36.614
But you said later on,
didn't you? Yes, yes.

38:36.654 --> 38:40.387
Later on it'll be.
Good-bye. Good-bye, Mr Dowd.

38:49.171 --> 38:51.435
Boy, that was
a close shave!

38:51.507 --> 38:54.304
But he seemed like a
reasonable sort of a fellow.

38:54.344 --> 38:57.041
You handled him beautifully,
Doctor. You were wonderful.

38:57.081 --> 39:00.514
Psychology. Specialized
training. Takes years of it.

39:04.792 --> 39:08.786
Good afternoon, Mrs Chumley.
Good afternoon, Herman.

39:11.834 --> 39:15.032
Oh, stop the car
a moment, Wesley.

39:15.105 --> 39:16.801
Yoo-hoo!

39:16.875 --> 39:19.777
<i>Yoo-hoo!</i>

39:24.484 --> 39:28.517
Is there something I can do for
you? What did you have in mind?

39:28.557 --> 39:33.393
You were walking on my husband's
prized dahlias. I'm Dr Chumley's wife.

39:33.463 --> 39:38.300
Oh, Dowd's my name. Elwood
P. Let me give you…

39:38.370 --> 39:42.000
Looking for someone over
there? Yes. My friend Harvey.

39:42.074 --> 39:45.072
I turned my back for an instant
and he seems to have wandered off.

39:45.112 --> 39:48.879
I wish you could meet him,
Mrs Chumley.

39:48.950 --> 39:52.382
I'm sure he'd be quite taken
with you. Oh, thank you!

39:52.422 --> 39:56.689
You're very nice to say so. Oh, not at all.

39:56.761 --> 40:01.861
Mrs Chumley, would you care to come downtown
with me? I'd be happy to buy you a drink.

40:01.901 --> 40:05.895
Oh, I can't. My husband and I
are going to a cocktail party.

40:05.973 --> 40:08.403
Dr McClure is giving a party
for his sister from Wichita.

40:08.443 --> 40:11.541
Oh! I didn't know Dr McClure
had a sister in Wichita.

40:11.581 --> 40:13.675
You know Dr McClure?
No.

40:13.750 --> 40:18.249
But you… But are you sure you wouldn't
have time to come with me and have a drink?

40:18.289 --> 40:21.524
No, I can't. I'll tell
you what I'll do, however.

40:21.527 --> 40:23.990
What will you do, however?
I'm interested.

40:24.030 --> 40:26.994
If I meet your friend inside, I'll
be glad to give him a message for you.

40:27.034 --> 40:29.898
Would you do that for me? I
certainly would appreciate that.

40:29.938 --> 40:33.303
Just tell him to meet me
downtown if he has no other plans.

40:33.343 --> 40:37.509
Any particular place
downtown? No, he knows where.

40:37.582 --> 40:40.913
Harvey knows this town like a book.
How will I recognize your friend?

40:40.953 --> 40:45.323
Oh, you can't miss him,
Mrs Chumley. He's a “pooka.”

40:45.392 --> 40:48.760
A pooka?
Is that something new?

40:48.830 --> 40:52.700
No, no. As I understand it,
that's something very old.

40:52.769 --> 40:56.638
But Harvey's not only a pooka,
he's also my best friend.

40:56.707 --> 41:02.204
Oh, if Harvey's said to me once, I'll
bet he's said probably a million times.

41:02.282 --> 41:06.083
He said, “Mr Dowd,
I would do anything for you.”

41:06.153 --> 41:07.746
How sweet.

41:07.822 --> 41:11.281
Yeah. He's also very fond
of my sister Veta.

41:11.360 --> 41:14.091
But Veta doesn't seem
to care for Harvey.

41:14.164 --> 41:16.561
Don't you think that's rather
too bad, Mrs Chumley?

41:16.601 --> 41:20.633
I don't know. I gave up long ago
expecting my family to like my friends.

41:20.673 --> 41:23.270
It's useless! We must
keep on trying, mustn't we?

41:23.310 --> 41:25.369
Oh, yes.
Well, good-bye.

41:25.446 --> 41:27.277
Good-bye.

41:27.348 --> 41:29.544
Leslie, did he say
“pooka”?

41:29.618 --> 41:33.612
Yes, ma'am.
That's what the man said.

41:47.976 --> 41:50.343
Your pass? Oh! Yes, sir.

41:50.412 --> 41:52.380
There you are.

41:52.449 --> 41:55.213
Dowd.
Elwood P.

42:02.061 --> 42:06.328
Isn't that interesting! Yes,
I constructed this myself.

42:06.400 --> 42:10.064
Is that so? Well, I'll
declare! It's very simple. See?

42:14.645 --> 42:16.637
Closed.

42:18.716 --> 42:20.742
Opened.

42:20.819 --> 42:23.083
You're a very brilliant man. Thank you.

42:23.123 --> 42:27.021
My name is Herman Shimelplatzer,
but everybody calls me Herman.

42:27.061 --> 42:31.158
You're to be congratulated,
Mr Shimelplatzer. Thank you.

42:31.233 --> 42:34.263
Would you care to come over to my
house for dinner tomorrow night?

42:34.303 --> 42:36.567
I'm having a few friends in,
just informally.

42:36.607 --> 42:39.638
I certainly would. That's
very nice of you, Mr Dowd.

42:39.678 --> 42:42.477
Let me give you one
of my cards.

42:42.548 --> 42:44.978
If you should want to call me,
call me at this number.

42:45.018 --> 42:48.887
Don't call me at that one.
That's the old one. Good-bye.

42:54.964 --> 42:57.297
That's remarkable.

43:00.439 --> 43:04.672
I hate to take you away, Willie, but we
did promise Dr McClure we'd be there early.

43:04.712 --> 43:07.374
One moment, angel. My hat and
coat, Miss Kelly. Yes, Dr Chumley.

43:07.414 --> 43:10.412
<i>Dr Sanderson. I'm leaving
for the day. Yes, Doctor?</i>

43:10.452 --> 43:14.785
About the difficulty of this woman with the
big white rabbit. Has it been smoothed over?

43:14.825 --> 43:16.623
Yes, Doctor.
Good.

43:16.694 --> 43:21.160
I've had many patients out here with
animals, but never an animal that large.

43:21.200 --> 43:25.467
Yes, Doctor. She called him
Harvey. Unusual name for an animal.

43:25.538 --> 43:29.271
I want her to have a hypo at
6:00, with another one at 9:00.

43:29.311 --> 43:32.941
Willie… Yes, I'm
coming. My formula 9-7-7.

43:33.015 --> 43:34.916
Listen, Willie…

43:34.985 --> 43:38.583
Somebody's gonna have to give me a hand
with that Simmons dame. She's terrible!

43:38.623 --> 43:41.212
<i>I had to take her corset off
all by myself!</i>

43:41.252 --> 43:43.649
Hiya, Dr Chumley.
How's every little…

43:43.689 --> 43:46.018
Hey, what's with you and that hat? Hat?

43:46.058 --> 43:48.354
Here's your hat.
I'm wearing my hat.

43:48.394 --> 43:51.559
There was something… This
isn't my hat. Must be yours.

43:51.599 --> 43:54.262
No, mine is… Of course it's not yours.

43:54.336 --> 43:57.033
I'd like to say… No, dear,
of course it's not yours.

43:57.073 --> 43:59.036
But whose hat is it?
He won't let me talk.

43:59.076 --> 44:01.044
Look at this!

44:01.111 --> 44:05.743
Two holes cut in the crown.
It's probably some new fad.

44:05.818 --> 44:07.881
Perhaps Mr Dowd left it here, sir. Dowd?

44:07.921 --> 44:11.219
Yes, that's what I was… That's Mrs
Simmons' brother. I gave him a pass.

44:11.259 --> 44:15.991
I've been trying to tell you. I met a
gentleman at the gate. His name was Dowd.

44:16.031 --> 44:18.928
He said he was looking for
a friend of his named Harvey.

44:18.968 --> 44:21.631
Harvey?
Yes! Yes, Harvey.

44:21.705 --> 44:26.072
Holy smoke! I left the water running
on that Simmons dame in a hydro tub!

44:26.112 --> 44:30.577
Why are you looking at me like that,
Willie? He was a nice, polite man.

44:30.617 --> 44:33.715
He said his friend was a
pooka. Whatever that is.

44:33.755 --> 44:35.781
Gimme Upper West “R.”

44:35.858 --> 44:38.987
Where did he go, Mrs
Chumley? He went downtown.

44:39.062 --> 44:42.165
Dunphy, I left that
Simmons dame soakin' in 13.

44:42.166 --> 44:44.263
<i>Do me a favor.
Turn off thejuice.</i>

44:44.303 --> 44:46.498
So you gave him a pass!

44:46.571 --> 44:50.304
Perhaps they neglected to tell you at
medical school that a rabbit has pointed ears!

44:50.344 --> 44:52.278
Do you know what
you've done?

44:52.346 --> 44:56.212
You've allowed a psychopathic case to
roam around with an overgrown white rabbit!

44:56.252 --> 44:58.247
You've laid me open
to a lawsuit!

44:58.287 --> 45:00.784
I shall have to do something
I haven't done for 15 years.

45:00.824 --> 45:03.054
I'll have to go after this
man, Dowd, and bring him back!

45:03.094 --> 45:07.726
But when I do, Dr Sanderson, your connection
with this institution will have ended.

45:07.766 --> 45:11.632
Wilson, get the car. You'll have
to go to the McClure's without me.

45:11.672 --> 45:14.770
Take a cab. You two, get
that woman out of the tub!

45:14.810 --> 45:18.047
Willie? I'm going to call my attorney.

45:18.082 --> 45:18.441
Willie? I'm going to call my attorney.

45:18.481 --> 45:21.474
Wilson, what's a pooka? What's a what?

45:21.552 --> 45:24.113
A pooka.
A pooka?

45:24.189 --> 45:26.715
You could search me,
Mrs Chumley!

45:33.167 --> 45:36.865
“P.” “O.”

45:36.939 --> 45:39.465
Poo… Pooka!

45:39.542 --> 45:42.603
Oh dear, I'm already late
for the McClure's.

45:42.680 --> 45:45.980
I did promise them
I'd be on time.

45:50.357 --> 45:54.488
P-O-O-K-A.

45:55.898 --> 46:01.701
“Pooka.
From old Celtic mythology.

46:01.772 --> 46:05.437
“A fairy spirit
in animal form.

46:05.511 --> 46:08.140
“Always very large.

46:08.214 --> 46:11.651
“The pooka appears
here and there,

46:11.719 --> 46:13.880
“now and then,

46:13.955 --> 46:17.756
“to this one and that one.

46:17.827 --> 46:22.128
“A benign but
mischievous creature.

46:22.199 --> 46:26.501
“Very fond of rumpots,
crackpots…

46:26.572 --> 46:30.134
and “How are you,
Mr Wilson?”

46:43.194 --> 46:45.390
“How are you,
Mr Wilson?”

46:45.464 --> 46:48.059
Who in the encyclopedia
wants to know?

46:48.134 --> 46:51.498
Wilson, let's go. Dr Chumley,
the screwiest thing just hap…

46:51.538 --> 46:55.433
I know, and believe me, heads
will roll. But I was looking…

46:56.946 --> 46:59.814
Quick, downtown.
Step on it.

47:14.136 --> 47:16.364
Oh. Where's your mother? Where is she?

47:16.404 --> 47:19.435
She took Uncle Elwood out to the
sanitarium. I thought you knew.

47:19.475 --> 47:22.172
She just called me on the phone
at the club. She's hysterical.

47:22.212 --> 47:25.643
Where's your phone? In the library.
What was Mother hysterical about?

47:25.683 --> 47:27.880
I don't know. I couldn't make
out what she was talking about.

47:27.920 --> 47:31.084
She was carrying on something fierce.
Where's the number of that sanitarium?

47:31.124 --> 47:33.461
I'll look it up. I don't know
what Mother had to carry on about.

47:33.501 --> 47:36.365
All she had to do was have Uncle
Elwood locked up. Maybe that's it.

47:36.405 --> 47:40.437
I feel bad about havin' Elwood
locked up. I always liked that boy.

47:40.477 --> 47:44.076
He could've done anything, been anything,
made a place for himself in the community.

47:44.116 --> 47:46.645
And all he did was get a
big rabbit. Yeah, I know.

47:46.685 --> 47:50.951
He's had that rabbit in my office many
a time. I'm old, but I don't miss much.

47:50.991 --> 47:54.222
What's the name of this place?
Chumley's what? Chumley's Rest.

47:54.262 --> 47:57.927
Yeah, Elwood had everything.
Brains, personality and friends.

47:57.967 --> 48:00.530
Men liked him. Women
liked him. I liked him!

48:00.570 --> 48:03.665
Women liked him?
Uncle Elwood? Mother!

48:03.741 --> 48:06.768
Myrtle!
Veta Louise!

48:06.845 --> 48:10.343
What's wrong, girl? I thought
I'd never see either of you again.

48:10.383 --> 48:13.547
Take hold of her. She looks like
she's going to faint. Not so fast.

48:13.587 --> 48:17.120
Don't rush her. Ease her in.
Get me where I can sit down.

48:17.160 --> 48:20.056
There you are. Get her some
tea. Let me sit down somewhere.

48:20.096 --> 48:23.932
You want some tea? Oh,
no. I don't want any tea.

48:24.002 --> 48:27.867
The minute their backs were turned,
I ran like a frightened rabbit.

48:27.907 --> 48:32.141
Oh, I didn't mean to say that!
I don't know what I'm saying.

48:32.213 --> 48:35.711
Just let me sit here. Let me get
my breath. Let her get her breath.

48:35.751 --> 48:41.248
Let me get my breath and then let me get
upstairs to my own bed where I can let go.

48:41.325 --> 48:43.486
Mother,
what happened?

48:43.561 --> 48:47.795
I want you to sue them. They
put me in and let Elwood out.

48:47.867 --> 48:52.396
What's this? As I was going to the
taxi cab to get Elwood's things,

48:52.472 --> 48:57.002
this awful man stepped out, he
was a white slaver, I know he was.

48:57.079 --> 49:00.343
He was wearing one of those white
suits. That's how they advertise.

49:00.383 --> 49:05.550
What did he do? He grabbed hold of
me and took me in there, and he…

49:05.624 --> 49:07.751
Oh!

49:07.826 --> 49:12.197
Go on, Veta. Go on,
Mother. Was he a young man?

49:12.266 --> 49:15.330
Myrtle Mae, perhaps you'd better
leave the room. Now? I should say not.

49:15.370 --> 49:17.737
Go on, Mother.
What'd he do, Veta?

49:17.807 --> 49:22.404
He took me upstairs
and tore my clothes off.

49:22.479 --> 49:25.074
Did you hear that?
Go on, Mother.

49:25.149 --> 49:28.449
And then he dumped me
down in a tub of water.

49:28.520 --> 49:31.751
Oh, for heaven's sake! By
Godfrey, I'll sue them for this!

49:31.791 --> 49:34.989
I always thought that what
you were showed in your face.

49:35.029 --> 49:37.626
Don't you believe it, Judge,
Myrtle Mae.

49:37.666 --> 49:41.665
That man grabbed hold of me as
though I was a woman of the streets.

49:41.705 --> 49:45.103
But I fought. I always said that
if a man jumped at me, I'd fight.

49:45.143 --> 49:47.273
Haven't I always said that,
Myrtle Mae?

49:47.313 --> 49:50.310
She's always said that. That's
what Mother's always told me to do.

49:50.350 --> 49:54.782
He hustled me into the sanitarium
and dumped me in that tub of water…

49:54.822 --> 49:57.152
and treated me as though I was a… A what?

49:57.192 --> 50:00.629
A crazy woman. But he
did that just for spite.

50:00.697 --> 50:03.461
<i>Well, I'll be swizzled!
Then one of those doctors…</i>

50:03.501 --> 50:06.538
came upstairs and asked me
a lot of questions.

50:06.605 --> 50:09.973
All about sex urges
and all that filthy stuff.

50:10.043 --> 50:12.339
That place ought to be
cleaned up, Judge.

50:12.379 --> 50:14.976
You ought to get the authorities
to clean it up.

50:15.016 --> 50:17.980
Don't you ever go out there.
You hear me, Myrtle Mae?

50:18.020 --> 50:21.251
This stinks to high heaven.
By Godfrey, it stinks!

50:21.291 --> 50:26.458
Is that all those doctors do in
places like that, think about sex?

50:26.532 --> 50:30.063
I don't know. Because if it is, they
ought to be ashamed of themselves.

50:30.103 --> 50:32.149
It's all
in their heads anyway.

50:32.205 --> 50:36.075
Why don't they take long
walks in the fresh air?

50:36.144 --> 50:39.776
Judge Gaffney walked everywhere
for years, didn't you, Judge?

50:39.816 --> 50:43.878
Did you? I better take some notes on this.

50:43.954 --> 50:47.252
You said one of the doctors
came up to talk to you?

50:47.292 --> 50:51.224
Yes. Dr Sanderson. But don't pay
any attention to anything he says.

50:51.264 --> 50:54.894
He's a liar. Close-set
eyes. They're always liars.

50:54.969 --> 50:59.536
Besides, I told him something in
strictest confidence and he blabbed it.

50:59.576 --> 51:01.601
You can't trust anyone!

51:01.678 --> 51:05.115
What did you tell him? What
difference does it make?

51:05.182 --> 51:10.622
I don't want to think about it.
I don't want to talk about it.

51:10.690 --> 51:13.990
Anything you told Dr Sanderson,
you can tell us.

51:14.061 --> 51:17.660
This is your daughter, and I'm
your lawyer. I know which is which.

51:17.700 --> 51:20.296
I don't want to talk about
it. I want to sue them.

51:20.336 --> 51:24.638
And I want to get upstairs
to my own bed.

51:24.709 --> 51:27.406
I should never have tried
to do anything about Elwood.

51:27.446 --> 51:30.575
Something protects him.
That awful pooka.

51:30.650 --> 51:34.553
Where is Uncle Elwood? How
should I know? They let him go!

51:34.622 --> 51:37.319
They're not interested
in men at places like that.

51:37.359 --> 51:40.723
You ought to know that,
Myrtle Mae. Don't be so naive.

51:40.763 --> 51:44.929
Mother, no matter who jumped at you, we still
have to find Uncle Elwood and lock him up.

51:44.969 --> 51:47.165
The next time,
you take him, Judge.

51:47.205 --> 51:51.571
Oh, wait 'til Elwood hears what they
did to me. He won't stand for it.

51:51.611 --> 51:53.807
You've got to sue them.

51:53.881 --> 51:57.648
Myrtle Mae, I hope that
never, as long as you live,

51:57.719 --> 52:02.350
a man tears the clothes off you
and sets you down in a tub of water.

52:02.425 --> 52:07.364
Oh, there he is now! He's
after me! Stay where you are!

52:07.432 --> 52:10.897
Knock him down, Judge. Kick
him! Don't let him get me!

52:10.937 --> 52:14.067
Veta, please. I want you to
confront this man with your charges.

52:14.107 --> 52:17.439
I don't want no part of that wacky dame.
I'm looking for that other screwball.

52:17.479 --> 52:20.042
<i>He's gotta go back to
Chumley's Rest. Kick him, Judge!</i>

52:20.082 --> 52:22.244
Veta, did you hear that?

52:22.319 --> 52:26.450
Where is he? Where is
this guy, Elwood P. Dowd?

52:26.524 --> 52:29.187
That screwball
with a rabbit.

52:29.261 --> 52:32.392
What's the matter, you goofy too?
You a member of this cockeyed family?

52:32.432 --> 52:35.697
I'm Mrs Simmons' daughter.
Uncle Elwood is my uncle.

52:35.737 --> 52:39.635
Look, kid, I've been to four fires and
14 gin mills lookin' for that crackpot.

52:39.675 --> 52:42.372
A bartender give me a tip he
was here. Came with a bundle.

52:42.412 --> 52:44.809
Now, where is he? What'd you
do with him? You hidin' him?

52:44.849 --> 52:47.579
No…
I'm not hiding him.

52:47.653 --> 52:50.650
Hey, my name's Marvin
Wilson, honey. What's yours?

52:50.690 --> 52:53.688
Myrtle Mae. And I'm not
afraid of you. Myrtle Mae, huh?

52:53.728 --> 52:57.626
If we grab your uncle, you'll be comin'
to the sanitarium on visitin' days.

52:57.666 --> 53:00.463
Really, I don't know.
If you do, I'll be there.

53:00.503 --> 53:05.002
You will? If you don't see me right
away, stick around. I'll show up.

53:05.042 --> 53:07.105
Won't you sit down?
I got no time, kid.

53:07.145 --> 53:10.276
I gotta find that uncle of yours
and be on my way. Now, where is he?

53:10.316 --> 53:12.813
Where'd you put him? I
didn't put him anywhere.

53:12.853 --> 53:15.350
I want you to catch him just as
much as you want to catch him.

53:15.390 --> 53:17.753
I can't even have any callers
when he's around.

53:17.793 --> 53:21.691
You shouldn't have any trouble about
callers, honey. Thank you very much.

53:21.731 --> 53:23.527
I'll tell you something, Myrt. Yeah?

53:23.567 --> 53:26.430
You not only got a nice build,
but you got something else too.

53:26.470 --> 53:28.132
Really? What?

53:28.206 --> 53:31.938
You got the screwiest uncle that ever
stuck his puss inside our nuthouse.

53:31.978 --> 53:34.846
Would you like
a cup of coffee?

53:34.915 --> 53:37.612
I can't, kid. Dr Chumley's
checking all the police stations.

53:37.652 --> 53:42.452
I better catch up with him. You look
awfully hungry. How about a sandwich?

53:42.492 --> 53:45.290
Yeah, but I don't want that crazy dame
on my neck. Don't worry about Mother.

53:45.330 --> 53:47.659
She won't come down.
She's too frightened.

53:47.700 --> 53:51.398
Would you like a ham and rye?
How about an egg and onion?

53:51.438 --> 53:54.869
I'd love to make you one. The eggs
and onions are waiting in the kitchen.

53:54.909 --> 53:58.106
Suppose we go in the kitchen.
You can relax and be yourself.

53:58.146 --> 54:01.051
Do you like your work?
Oh, I do now, Myrtle!

54:35.689 --> 54:38.990
Charlie's Place?
Oh, Mr Cracker.

54:39.061 --> 54:42.725
Mr Cracker, this is
Elwood P. Dowd speaking.

54:42.799 --> 54:46.793
Tell me,
have you seen Harvey?

54:46.871 --> 54:50.069
Uh-huh. Well, don't worry. I'll find him.

54:50.142 --> 54:54.375
Mr Cracker, I'm entertaining some
friends there tonight at 10:00.

54:54.415 --> 54:57.317
May I have
my regular booth?

54:57.386 --> 55:00.356
Oh, fine. Thank you.
Good-bye.

55:36.271 --> 55:38.205
Harvey!

55:39.408 --> 55:41.069
Harvey?

55:43.547 --> 55:45.106
Hello?

55:45.183 --> 55:48.013
Come on. Don't you wanna come back
in the kitchen and get acquainted?

55:48.053 --> 55:51.090
I thought I heard voices.
What kind of voices?

55:51.091 --> 55:55.189
Come on, I wanna talk to you. It
sounded something like “Harvey.”

55:55.229 --> 55:59.094
Harvey? I'd better get goin'. You
haven't finished your egg and onion.

55:59.134 --> 56:02.532
Business before pleasure, even
if it's a pleasure bein' with you.

56:02.572 --> 56:06.006
You make a great egg and
onion. Don't you want more?

56:06.044 --> 56:10.076
I'll see you tomorrow out at the
nuthouse. You didn't finish your sandwich.

56:10.116 --> 56:13.080
Wilson! What happened to
you? He's not here, Doctor.

56:13.120 --> 56:15.183
Then what are you doing
here? I was just having…

56:15.223 --> 56:17.485
What are you eating? An
egg and onion sandwich.

56:17.525 --> 56:20.622
How can you think of food at a time
like this? Get over to Union Station.

56:20.662 --> 56:23.960
I'm told Dowd goes down there to
watch trains. All right, Doctor.

56:24.001 --> 56:27.332
Why did you send him away? Some
people pick the best times…

56:27.372 --> 56:31.637
to keep other people from becoming
acquainted. My, dear… Judge Gaffney!

56:31.677 --> 56:33.474
<i>Chumley, just the man
I want to see.</i>

56:33.514 --> 56:37.011
Mrs Simmons has retained me to file
suit against you. I've been searching…

56:37.051 --> 56:40.182
File suit? I'm on my way to the
office to draw up the necessary papers.

56:40.222 --> 56:43.887
What happened this afternoon was an unfortunate
mistake, but I've dismissed my assistant…

56:43.927 --> 56:46.357
We shall see what we shall
see. There must be some way…

56:46.397 --> 56:50.362
You'll hear from me in the morning.
Good-bye. But surely, Judge…

56:50.402 --> 56:53.065
This is
most unfortunate.

56:53.139 --> 56:56.473
<i>Most unfortunate.
Judge Gaffney?</i>

56:56.544 --> 56:59.713
Judge Gaffney, I want…
You're not Judge Gaffney.

56:59.748 --> 57:02.044
You have much more hair
than he has.

57:02.084 --> 57:04.848
Besides, I never forget
a face. I'm Dr Chumley.

57:04.888 --> 57:08.653
You're Mrs Simmons. Yes, of course.
I'm glad to know you, Dr Chumley.

57:08.693 --> 57:12.791
Would you mind asking Judge
Gaffney to come back? Certainly.

57:12.866 --> 57:18.135
I want to tell him to sue you for $100·000.
I don't think $50·000 is enough.

57:18.207 --> 57:20.836
Mrs Simmons,
can't we talk this matter over?

57:20.876 --> 57:25.109
After what happened to me today in the
bathtub? I don't want to talk it over!

57:25.149 --> 57:27.112
Then will you please
just listen?

57:27.152 --> 57:29.614
I don't want to listen to you.
I'm suing you.

57:29.654 --> 57:32.885
Please listen to me, I beg of
you. I'll listen, all right.

57:32.925 --> 57:36.886
But I'm warning you, it
won't do you any good. Hello.

57:36.965 --> 57:41.733
No, I am not listening to my radio.
I am listening to Dr Chumley.

57:41.804 --> 57:44.774
Mrs Simmons, that picture
over the mantle?

57:44.841 --> 57:49.280
That portrait of my mother happens
to be the pride of this house.

57:49.348 --> 57:52.614
Who painted it? Some
man. I forget his name.

57:52.685 --> 57:55.883
He was around for the sittings.
Then we paid him and he went away.

57:55.923 --> 57:58.920
I suppose if you have the money, you
can persuade people to do anything.

57:58.960 --> 58:03.228
You brought this up. You might
as well learn something quickly.

58:03.300 --> 58:06.698
I took a course in art last winter.
I learned the difference between…

58:06.738 --> 58:11.039
a fine oil painting and a
mechanical thing, like a photograph.

58:11.110 --> 58:13.619
The photograph shows
only the reality.

58:13.647 --> 58:18.814
The painting shows not only the
reality, but the dream behind it.

58:18.887 --> 58:21.823
It's our dreams
that carry us on.

58:21.891 --> 58:24.486
They separate us
from the beasts.

58:24.562 --> 58:28.560
I wouldn't want to go on living if I
thought it was all just eating and sleeping.

58:28.600 --> 58:32.128
And taking my clothes off.
I mean, putting them on.

58:32.204 --> 58:35.333
Ooh, ooh!
Oh, Doctor!

58:35.409 --> 58:38.006
Mrs Simmons, steady now,
steady. Don't upset yourself.

58:38.046 --> 58:41.310
Everything's going to be
all right. What's the matter?

58:41.350 --> 58:44.081
Doctor, that is not
my mother!

58:44.154 --> 58:46.385
I'm very glad
to hear that.

58:46.457 --> 58:50.689
Elwood's been here. He's been here,
Doctor! Now, now, better be quiet.

58:50.729 --> 58:53.597
I'll take it.

58:53.666 --> 58:57.228
Hello? Yes?
Who's calling?

58:57.305 --> 58:59.935
He's here! It's your
brother! Let me talk to him.

58:59.975 --> 59:03.105
Be careful. Don't let him
know that I'm here. Be casual.

59:03.145 --> 59:05.671
Yes, I'll be casual.
Yes.

59:05.749 --> 59:08.617
Hello, Elwood.
Where are you, dear?

59:08.686 --> 59:12.179
I'm here, Veta.
I-Is Harvey there?

59:12.257 --> 59:16.593
He won't say where he is. He
wants to know if Harvey's here.

59:16.664 --> 59:19.259
Tell him Harvey is here. But he isn't!

59:19.334 --> 59:23.829
I know that, but pretend he
is. We've got to humor him.

59:23.906 --> 59:26.842
Hello, Elwood.
Yes, dear, Harvey's here.

59:26.910 --> 59:29.106
Why don't you come home?

59:30.549 --> 59:34.114
It won't work. He wants us
to call Harvey to the telephone.

59:34.154 --> 59:38.653
Well, say Harvey's here but he can't come
to the phone because he's in the bathtub.

59:38.693 --> 59:42.927
Oh, Doctor! You've got
to do it, Mrs Simmons.

59:42.999 --> 59:48.433
Yes, dear, Harvey is here, but he can't
come to the telephone. He's in the bathtub.

59:48.473 --> 59:52.238
I'll send him over as soon as
he's dry. Where are you, dear?

59:52.278 --> 59:54.212
I-I-I'm…

59:54.280 --> 59:58.048
Never mind. Harvey just
walked in the door down here.

59:58.119 --> 01:00:02.250
Oh… Mr Cracker,
two martinis.

01:00:02.324 --> 01:00:04.259
Good-bye, Veta.

01:00:04.327 --> 01:00:08.264
You'd better look in the
bathtub. It must be a stranger.

01:00:08.332 --> 01:00:11.997
He says Harvey just walked through the
door. It must be a stranger in the bathtub.

01:00:12.037 --> 01:00:14.934
But I know where he is.
He's at Charlie's Place.

01:00:14.974 --> 01:00:19.106
That's a bar at 12th and Main.
That's two over and one down.

01:00:19.181 --> 01:00:22.278
Where are you going? I'm going to
get your brother and bring him back,

01:00:22.318 --> 01:00:24.313
take him to the sanitarium
where he belongs.

01:00:24.353 --> 01:00:26.750
I want to observe the expression on
his face when he talks to this rabbit.

01:00:26.790 --> 01:00:29.354
He does talk to the rabbit?
They tell each other everything.

01:00:29.394 --> 01:00:33.024
What? Yes, he talks to
him, but don't go out there.

01:00:33.099 --> 01:00:36.664
You'll regret it if you do.
Nonsense. You underestimate me

01:00:36.704 --> 01:00:40.302
No, you underestimate my brother.
Don't worry. I can handle him.

01:00:40.342 --> 01:00:43.870
You can handle him?
That's what you think.

01:00:43.947 --> 01:00:48.716
Myrtle Mae, see who the
stranger is in the bathtub.

01:00:59.534 --> 01:01:02.129
Sounds funny,
but I'll miss this place.

01:01:02.204 --> 01:01:06.107
I guess I'll miss
a lot of things around here.

01:01:06.176 --> 01:01:08.145
You will?

01:01:08.212 --> 01:01:11.182
You won't laugh?
Of course not.

01:01:11.250 --> 01:01:14.689
You know how it is working around people
day after day. You get attached to them.

01:01:14.729 --> 01:01:18.461
I know, Lyman. It may be
ridiculous, but I'm gonna miss…

01:01:18.535 --> 01:01:22.233
every one of the psychos and
neuros and schizos in the place.

01:01:22.273 --> 01:01:24.235
I guess I'll even miss
Dr Chumley.

01:01:24.275 --> 01:01:27.139
In spite of the fact that he fired me,
I have a genuine admiration for him.

01:01:27.179 --> 01:01:30.009
You can miss your psychos
and schizos, Dr Sanderson!

01:01:30.049 --> 01:01:33.314
You can miss whomever you
please. But after you leave here,

01:01:33.354 --> 01:01:36.251
I won't miss a thing,
not a single, solitary thing!

01:01:36.291 --> 01:01:39.589
Now what's wrong? Nothing. I
came down to say good-bye to you.

01:01:39.629 --> 01:01:41.925
So good-bye, good luck
and good riddance!

01:01:41.965 --> 01:01:44.862
You can't even say good-bye without
putting it on a personal basis.

01:01:44.902 --> 01:01:47.599
Don't flatter yourself. There's
nothing personal about this.

01:01:47.639 --> 01:01:49.903
I think you've been working too
hard. You're getting neurotic.

01:01:49.943 --> 01:01:53.341
Don't start analyzing me. Save
your psychiatry for your next job!

01:01:53.381 --> 01:01:57.346
I'm not using psychiatry. And let
me give you a little friendly advice.

01:01:57.386 --> 01:02:01.352
That chip on your shoulder stems from a
persecution complex that goes back to childhood.

01:02:01.392 --> 01:02:03.722
Thanks so much for
the case history, Doctor.

01:02:03.762 --> 01:02:07.860
Could you tell me what an overinflated
ego stems from? Now, listen here!

01:02:07.900 --> 01:02:10.870
Hiya, Kelly.
Hiya, Doc.

01:02:10.937 --> 01:02:13.134
I'm glad I caught you
before you left.

01:02:13.174 --> 01:02:17.373
I'm sorry you got bounced. We're
all gonna miss ya. Thanks, Wilson.

01:02:17.413 --> 01:02:20.276
Any of the patients been acting
up? Everything's just peachy!

01:02:20.316 --> 01:02:22.847
That's good. When are
you takin' off? Right now.

01:02:22.887 --> 01:02:25.283
I was waiting
for Dr Chumley to get back.

01:02:25.323 --> 01:02:29.188
Wait a second. Didn't Dr Chumley
come back with that pyscho?

01:02:29.228 --> 01:02:32.893
We thought he was with you. No.
I left him with that Simmons dame.

01:02:32.933 --> 01:02:37.800
When I called back later to check with him,
she told me the Doctor went to bring her bro…

01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:40.871
That was four hours ago! Have
you any idea where he went?

01:02:40.911 --> 01:02:42.937
Yeah. No!
Come on, come on.

01:02:43.014 --> 01:02:47.546
I don't know. I can't think. Poor Dr Chumley
may be layin' in an alley in a pool of blood.

01:02:47.586 --> 01:02:49.883
Mr Dowd seemed harmless
this afternoon.

01:02:49.923 --> 01:02:53.087
I've been wrestling these guys for
years, and they're pretty tricky.

01:02:53.127 --> 01:02:55.824
One minute they're sweet, and the
next minute… they give you the knife.

01:02:55.864 --> 01:02:59.295
The name of the place? It was
a barroom and a guy's name.

01:02:59.335 --> 01:03:02.466
Charlie! Charlie's Place.
That's a lead. We'll start there.

01:03:02.506 --> 01:03:05.236
Never mind. I'll go with
Wilson. You needn't bother.

01:03:05.276 --> 01:03:08.107
Until Dr Chumley comes back,
I'm still in charge here!

01:03:08.147 --> 01:03:11.580
Let's get goin'. Let's not
stand and argue about it.

01:03:38.053 --> 01:03:40.215
Yeah,
this is the place.

01:03:46.265 --> 01:03:49.462
What'll it be, folks? We're
looking for someone, two men.

01:03:49.502 --> 01:03:53.868
A tall, short one and a thin, fat one. I'm
so nervous, I don't know what I'm sayin'.

01:03:53.908 --> 01:03:56.638
One man is short and middle-aged.
The other is much taller and younger.

01:03:56.678 --> 01:03:59.509
They might have been here about
four hours ago. No, can't say I have.

01:03:59.549 --> 01:04:01.645
We've been running
medium sizes all evenin'.

01:04:01.685 --> 01:04:04.649
The tall man was soft-spoken and
sort of polite. His name is Dowd.

01:04:04.689 --> 01:04:08.716
Dowd? Why didn't you say so?
He's here now in the back booth.

01:04:11.131 --> 01:04:13.995
Is he alone? Well, there's
two schools of thought, sir.

01:04:14.035 --> 01:04:17.199
If that crackpot did anything to
Dr Chumley, I'll knock his teeth…

01:04:17.239 --> 01:04:19.602
No rough stuff. Psychology.
I'll do the talking.

01:04:19.642 --> 01:04:22.473
Well, I've been expecting
you. Where's the Doctor?

01:04:22.513 --> 01:04:26.678
Wilson! Why don't you
take a look around the place?

01:04:26.751 --> 01:04:31.053
Why don't you do that? Although
I don't believe it's for sale.

01:04:31.124 --> 01:04:34.822
Miss Kelly,
these are for you.

01:04:34.896 --> 01:04:38.264
Why, thank you, Mr
Dowd! A pleasure, my dear.

01:04:38.334 --> 01:04:43.601
You know, after what happened this afternoon,
these flowers really should be from you.

01:04:43.641 --> 01:04:46.972
Now, won't you join me? Mr
Dowd, I'm afraid we can't do that.

01:04:47.012 --> 01:04:50.476
The situation has changed since this
afternoon, but I urge you to have no resentment.

01:04:50.516 --> 01:04:53.981
Dr Chumley is your friend and he only
wants to help you. Isn't that nice!

01:04:54.021 --> 01:04:57.586
I'd be glad to help him. We all must
face reality, Dowd, sooner or later.

01:04:57.626 --> 01:05:02.361
Uh-huh. Well, I wrestled with
reality for 35 years, Doctor.

01:05:02.432 --> 01:05:05.960
And I'm happy to state
I finally won out over it.

01:05:06.037 --> 01:05:08.063
Mr Dowd,
where is Dr Chumley?

01:05:08.140 --> 01:05:11.110
Not knowing, I cannot say. Wish I could.

01:05:11.177 --> 01:05:15.270
Miss Kelly, I don't like to see
you standing. Sit down, Kelly.

01:05:16.985 --> 01:05:20.979
There we are. Now, let's all have a drink.

01:05:21.057 --> 01:05:23.387
Dr Chumley did come in here
to get you earlier this evening?

01:05:23.427 --> 01:05:26.091
Yes, he did. And I was
delighted to see him.

01:05:26.131 --> 01:05:28.726
What'll it be, Mr Dowd? Martinis?

01:05:28.801 --> 01:05:33.671
–But that was four hours ago.
–Where has the evening gone?

01:05:33.740 --> 01:05:38.543
Four… Three martinis, Mr Cracker.

01:05:38.614 --> 01:05:41.144
I've looked all over this joint. There's
no sign of the Doctor. What'd you do to him?

01:05:41.184 --> 01:05:43.214
We're trying to find out.
What happened then?

01:05:43.254 --> 01:05:48.090
I introduced Harvey to the
Doctor, and he sat down with us.

01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:50.186
Harvey was sitting here,

01:05:50.263 --> 01:05:54.428
and the Doctor sat opposite
Harvey so he could look at him.

01:05:54.501 --> 01:05:57.562
Who's Harvey? A white
rabbit, six feet tall.

01:05:57.639 --> 01:06:01.738
–Six feet?
–Six feet, three and a half
inches. Let's stick to facts.

01:06:01.778 --> 01:06:04.275
What happened after you
introduced Dr Chumley to Harvey?

01:06:04.315 --> 01:06:07.114
Harvey suggested that
I buy him a drink.

01:06:07.186 --> 01:06:10.984
Knowing that he doesn't like to drink alone,
I suggested to Dr Chumley we join him.

01:06:11.024 --> 01:06:12.719
We joined him.

01:06:12.792 --> 01:06:14.488
<i>Go on.
Wejoined him again.</i>

01:06:14.528 --> 01:06:18.090
–Then what?
–Then the other matter came up.

01:06:18.166 --> 01:06:20.496
Now we're gettin' somewhere.
What other matter?

01:06:20.536 --> 01:06:24.405
Eh… Mr Wilson, I don't
like to see you standing.

01:06:24.475 --> 01:06:26.705
Wouldn't you join us here? Who, me?

01:06:26.745 --> 01:06:29.681
Sit down, will you, Wilson? Sit right down.

01:06:29.749 --> 01:06:32.112
You say this other matter
came up, Mr Dowd.

01:06:32.152 --> 01:06:36.249
Yes. There was a beautiful blonde
woman name of Mrs Smethills…

01:06:36.324 --> 01:06:40.220
and her escort seated in the
booth directly across from us.

01:06:40.230 --> 01:06:44.327
Dr Chumley went over to sit
next to her, explaining to her…

01:06:44.401 --> 01:06:48.634
that they had once met…
in Chicago.

01:06:48.707 --> 01:06:52.201
Then her escort
escorted Dr Chumley…

01:06:52.279 --> 01:06:54.839
back here
to Harvey and me,

01:06:54.915 --> 01:06:58.079
and tried to point out that it
would be better for Dr Chumley…

01:06:58.120 --> 01:07:00.714
to mind
his own affairs.

01:07:00.790 --> 01:07:02.786
Does he have any? Does he have any what?

01:07:02.826 --> 01:07:05.762
Any affairs? How would I know? Shut up!

01:07:05.830 --> 01:07:10.531
Go on, Mr Dowd. Well…
Thank you, Mr Cracker.

01:07:10.603 --> 01:07:15.970
Mrs Smethills' escort seemed to get more
depressed as he kept looking at Dr Chumley.

01:07:16.010 --> 01:07:19.308
So Harvey and I felt we should
take the Doctor somewhere else.

01:07:19.348 --> 01:07:22.318
Harvey suggested
Blondie's Chicken Inn,

01:07:22.386 --> 01:07:24.748
but the Doctor
wanted to go to Eddie's.

01:07:24.788 --> 01:07:28.865
And while they were arguing about it, I
went up to the bar to order another drink.

01:07:28.905 --> 01:07:31.235
<i>When I came back here,
they were gone.</i>

01:07:31.275 --> 01:07:35.207
You don't believe that story about the
Doctor talking to a big white rabbit, do you?

01:07:35.247 --> 01:07:37.614
Why not?
Harvey was here.

01:07:37.683 --> 01:07:41.176
At first Dr Chumley seemed
frightened of Harvey,

01:07:41.255 --> 01:07:44.886
but that gave way to admiration
as the evening wore on.

01:07:46.662 --> 01:07:48.823
“The evening wore on.”

01:07:48.898 --> 01:07:51.461
That's a very nice expression, isn't it?

01:07:51.501 --> 01:07:55.029
With your permission,
I'll say it again.

01:07:55.106 --> 01:07:57.234
“The evening wore on.”

01:07:57.309 --> 01:08:00.640
And with your permission
I'm gonna knock your brains out.

01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:04.412
Look, you did something to Dr Chumley,
and I'm gonna find out what it is.

01:08:04.452 --> 01:08:08.150
<i>Stop! Lyman! Wilson!
For heaven's sake!</i>

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:17.935
Get outside!
Mr Cracker?

01:08:18.002 --> 01:08:22.031
Sure, Mr Dowd. Mr Cracker,
may I intercede for my friends?

01:08:22.108 --> 01:08:26.408
Youth and high spirits. Time will
take care of that. Sure, Mr Dowd.

01:08:26.448 --> 01:08:28.781
Okay, boys,
let 'em go.

01:08:28.850 --> 01:08:33.283
If Mr Dowd vouches for you, okay. One more
peep out of you and I'll butter your necktie.

01:08:33.323 --> 01:08:35.220
Yeah, fine. Get back to your dancing.

01:08:35.260 --> 01:08:38.558
Stimulating as all this is, I
think we all should have our drinks.

01:08:38.598 --> 01:08:40.395
Here, Miss Kelly,
sit down.

01:08:40.466 --> 01:08:42.867
Here we are.
Dr Sanderson.

01:08:44.772 --> 01:08:48.737
You keep your eye on him. I'm gonna
check in those other two joints.

01:08:48.777 --> 01:08:51.747
And Dr Chumley better
be there, pal… or else!

01:08:51.781 --> 01:08:53.943
Mr Wilson?
Yeah?

01:08:54.018 --> 01:08:58.015
Good-bye, Mr Wilson. My regards to you
and anybody else you happen to run into.

01:08:58.055 --> 01:09:01.493
Ah, you…

01:09:01.562 --> 01:09:06.428
Mr Dowd, can't you think of anything
else that might help us to find the Doctor?

01:09:06.468 --> 01:09:11.032
Miss Kelly, may I
take hold of your hand?

01:09:11.108 --> 01:09:14.203
Yes, Mr Dowd,
if you want to.

01:09:14.278 --> 01:09:18.443
We're all so worried.
Please try to think. Please?

01:09:18.517 --> 01:09:24.116
For you I'd do anything. I'd almost
be willing to live my life over again.

01:09:24.191 --> 01:09:27.491
Almost.
But I've told it all.

01:09:27.562 --> 01:09:30.122
You're sure?
I'm quite sure.

01:09:30.198 --> 01:09:32.196
But ask me again anyway,
won't you?

01:09:32.236 --> 01:09:37.004
I liked that warm tone you
had in your voice just then.

01:09:37.075 --> 01:09:39.600
So did I.

01:09:39.679 --> 01:09:43.645
Maybe we better go someplace else.
Miss Kelly seems to be unhappy.

01:09:43.685 --> 01:09:46.779
No, let's stay here.
Kelly's all right.

01:09:46.854 --> 01:09:49.791
Perhaps you'd like
to dance, Miss Kelly.

01:09:49.859 --> 01:09:53.488
All right, Mr Dowd, if
you'd like to. Oh, not I! No.

01:09:53.564 --> 01:09:56.932
I used to dance.
I haven't danced in years.

01:09:57.002 --> 01:10:01.401
I'm sure Dr Sanderson would love to
dance with somebody as lovely as you.

01:10:01.442 --> 01:10:05.573
Hmm? Would you, Miss Kelly?

01:10:05.647 --> 01:10:08.242
All right.
There we are.

01:10:31.314 --> 01:10:34.752
It's been a long time
since we've danced together.

01:10:34.819 --> 01:10:37.983
Yes, a long time.

01:10:38.057 --> 01:10:40.587
I'd forgotten what
a wonderful dancer you were.

01:10:40.627 --> 01:10:44.826
If we didn't have to humor Mr Dowd,
you wouldn't have remembered at all.

01:10:44.866 --> 01:10:48.325
I'm not dancing with you
to humor Mr Dowd, Ruth.

01:10:58.483 --> 01:11:00.662
We shouldn't
have left him alone!

01:11:03.924 --> 01:11:06.450
Where are you goin',
Mr Dowd?

01:11:06.528 --> 01:11:08.491
I was just looking
for someone.

01:11:08.531 --> 01:11:13.367
Why don't you come back inside?
All right, if you want me to.

01:11:13.436 --> 01:11:16.531
It seemed to be so pleasant
out here.

01:11:16.608 --> 01:11:20.636
You know, you two look
very nice dancing together.

01:11:20.713 --> 01:11:24.775
I used to know
a whole lot of dances.

01:11:24.852 --> 01:11:27.617
The Flea Hop.

01:11:27.689 --> 01:11:30.090
And what's the…

01:11:30.159 --> 01:11:34.689
The Black Bottom.
The Varsity Drag.

01:11:34.766 --> 01:11:40.137
I don't know. I just don't
seem to have any time anymore.

01:11:40.206 --> 01:11:43.301
I have so many things
to do.

01:11:43.376 --> 01:11:46.814
What is it you do,
Mr Dowd?

01:11:46.882 --> 01:11:50.011
Harvey and I
sit in the bars…

01:11:50.086 --> 01:11:55.286
and have a drink or two,
play the jukebox.

01:11:55.359 --> 01:11:59.024
And soon the faces
of all the other people,

01:11:59.098 --> 01:12:03.934
they turn toward mine
and they smile.

01:12:04.004 --> 01:12:09.352
They're saying, “We don't know your name,
mister, but you're a very nice fellow.”

01:12:10.446 --> 01:12:12.438
Harvey and I…

01:12:14.218 --> 01:12:17.950
warm ourselves
in all these golden moments.

01:12:18.023 --> 01:12:22.985
We've entered as strangers.
Soon we have friends.

01:12:23.063 --> 01:12:25.965
And they come over
and they sit with us,

01:12:26.034 --> 01:12:28.559
they drink with us
they talk to us.

01:12:28.637 --> 01:12:32.973
And they tell about the big,
terrible things they've done…

01:12:33.043 --> 01:12:36.107
<i>and the big, wonderful things
they'll do.</i>

01:12:36.147 --> 01:12:40.585
Their hopes
and their regrets,

01:12:40.653 --> 01:12:45.319
and their loves and their
hates, all very large…

01:12:45.393 --> 01:12:49.125
because nobody ever brings
anything small into a bar.

01:12:51.367 --> 01:12:53.393
And then…

01:12:55.005 --> 01:12:56.940
I introduce them
to Harvey.

01:12:57.008 --> 01:13:01.503
And he's bigger and grander
than anything they offer me.

01:13:03.150 --> 01:13:08.021
And…
and when they leave,

01:13:08.090 --> 01:13:10.285
they leave impressed.

01:13:11.594 --> 01:13:15.031
The same people
seldom come back,

01:13:15.099 --> 01:13:18.433
but that's…
that's envy, my dear.

01:13:20.039 --> 01:13:24.443
There's a little bit of envy
in the best of us.

01:13:24.511 --> 01:13:27.538
And that's too bad,
isn't it?

01:13:30.052 --> 01:13:33.250
How did you happen
to call him Harvey?

01:13:33.323 --> 01:13:35.383
Well, Harvey's
his name.

01:13:35.460 --> 01:13:37.485
How do you
know that?

01:13:39.131 --> 01:13:43.159
There was a rather interesting
coincidence on that, Doctor.

01:13:43.236 --> 01:13:48.938
One night several years ago I was walking
early in the evening along Fairfax Street.

01:13:49.011 --> 01:13:53.279
It was between 18th and 19th.
Do you know the block?

01:13:53.350 --> 01:13:56.013
Yes, yes.

01:13:56.054 --> 01:13:58.049
I'd just put Ed Hickey
into a taxi.

01:13:58.089 --> 01:14:02.755
Ed had been mixing his
rye with his gin, and he…

01:14:02.829 --> 01:14:05.321
I just felt that
he needed conveying.

01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:10.395
Anyway, I was walking along the
street and I heard this voice saying,

01:14:10.472 --> 01:14:12.600
“Good evening, Mr Dowd.”

01:14:12.675 --> 01:14:15.577
Well, I turned around…

01:14:15.646 --> 01:14:20.176
and here was this big six-foot
rabbit leaning up against a lamppost.

01:14:20.253 --> 01:14:23.417
I thought nothing of that because
when you've lived in a town…

01:14:23.457 --> 01:14:28.356
as long as I've lived in this one, you get
used to the fact that everybody knows your name.

01:14:28.396 --> 01:14:31.570
Naturally, I went over
to chat with him.

01:14:31.704 --> 01:14:34.971
<i>And he said to me,
he said,</i>

01:14:35.043 --> 01:14:39.375
“Ed Hickey was a little spiffed this
evening. Or could I be mistaken?”

01:14:39.415 --> 01:14:41.543
Of course
he was not mistaken.

01:14:41.618 --> 01:14:46.716
I think the world and all
of Ed, but he was spiffed.

01:14:46.791 --> 01:14:51.890
We talked like that for a
while and then I said to him,

01:14:51.964 --> 01:14:54.365
“You have the advantage
on me.

01:14:54.435 --> 01:14:57.963
You know my name
and I don't know yours.”

01:14:58.039 --> 01:15:01.271
And right back at me
he said,

01:15:01.344 --> 01:15:03.370
“What name do you like?”

01:15:03.447 --> 01:15:07.851
Well, I didn't even have
to think twice about that.

01:15:07.919 --> 01:15:10.480
Harvey's always been
my favorite name.

01:15:10.556 --> 01:15:15.018
So I said to him,
I said, “Harvey.”

01:15:15.096 --> 01:15:18.589
And, uh…

01:15:18.667 --> 01:15:23.834
Th-This is the interesting thing
about the whole thing.

01:15:23.907 --> 01:15:28.311
He said,
“What a coincidence.

01:15:28.380 --> 01:15:31.316
My name happens
to be Harvey.”

01:15:36.090 --> 01:15:38.582
Dowd,

01:15:38.660 --> 01:15:42.222
what was
your father's name?

01:15:45.569 --> 01:15:50.668
John.
John Stuyvesant.

01:15:50.743 --> 01:15:52.836
Tell me, Dowd,

01:15:54.415 --> 01:15:58.546
when you were a child,
didn't you have a playmate?

01:15:58.620 --> 01:16:01.117
Someone with whom
you spent many happy hours?

01:16:01.157 --> 01:16:04.321
Yes. Yes,
I did, Doctor.

01:16:04.394 --> 01:16:06.090
Didn't you?
Yes.

01:16:06.164 --> 01:16:08.793
What was his name?

01:16:11.036 --> 01:16:13.870
Vern.
Vern McElhinney.

01:16:13.940 --> 01:16:16.237
You ever know the McElhinneys, Doctor? No.

01:16:16.277 --> 01:16:19.674
That's too bad. There were a
lot of them and they circulated.

01:16:19.714 --> 01:16:23.846
Very nice people.
Just wonderful people.

01:16:23.921 --> 01:16:26.413
Think carefully,
Dowd.

01:16:26.491 --> 01:16:30.589
Didn't you know somebody sometime,
someplace by the name of Harvey?

01:16:30.629 --> 01:16:33.565
Didn't you ever know anybody
by that name?

01:16:35.736 --> 01:16:39.366
No. No,
not one, Doctor.

01:16:39.441 --> 01:16:42.741
Maybe that's why I always
had such hopes for it.

01:16:44.815 --> 01:16:48.914
We looked in both of those joints, and
Dr Chumley ain't in either one of'em.

01:16:48.954 --> 01:16:52.584
I brought help.
What're you doin' out here?

01:16:52.658 --> 01:16:55.456
Come on. We're going back
to the sanitarium. Wh…

01:16:55.496 --> 01:16:59.092
Come, Elwood. Very well, Lyman.

01:16:59.168 --> 01:17:02.097
I'm afraid I won't be able to
stay very long. I must find Harvey.

01:17:02.137 --> 01:17:05.631
Which one is Dowd? My
name's Dowd, Elwood P.

01:17:05.710 --> 01:17:09.541
Here, let me give you one of
my cards. Never mind the card!

01:17:09.581 --> 01:17:11.982
Wilson,
what did I tell you?

01:17:17.157 --> 01:17:21.027
<i>Coming, coming.</i>

01:17:22.865 --> 01:17:24.962
Who is it? It's me. Open the gates quickly.

01:17:25.002 --> 01:17:27.972
Oh, it's you, Doctor!

01:17:31.544 --> 01:17:34.341
I thought you'd gone for the
night. I thought you'd gone.

01:17:34.381 --> 01:17:37.818
Close them, Herman.
Close the gates.

01:17:37.885 --> 01:17:40.215
Are you all right,
Doctor? I'm being followed.

01:17:40.255 --> 01:17:43.657
Who's following you? None of your business.

01:18:09.695 --> 01:18:12.164
Ahh! Ahh!

01:18:12.231 --> 01:18:14.564
You called me,
Doctor?

01:18:14.635 --> 01:18:18.163
No. No, I didn't.
No.

01:18:18.239 --> 01:18:21.073
Everything's fine.

01:19:07.538 --> 01:19:10.402
What's wrong? What happened,
Herman? What's goin' on?

01:19:10.442 --> 01:19:14.337
The alarm went off. Somebody
must've come through a window.

01:19:23.694 --> 01:19:26.356
Yes, Doctor. Sanderson, he's after me.

01:19:26.431 --> 01:19:28.626
Who's after you, Doctor?
I don't see anyone.

01:19:28.666 --> 01:19:31.430
I saw him. He came through
the window. Who was it?

01:19:31.470 --> 01:19:34.406
Who came through
the window, Doctor?

01:19:34.474 --> 01:19:37.104
I won't tell you. What's he talkin' about?

01:19:37.144 --> 01:19:38.669
Forget it.

01:19:38.747 --> 01:19:42.444
I'm going to my office and
I don't wish to be disturbed.

01:19:51.397 --> 01:19:53.491
Forget it, he says.
Not me.

01:19:53.567 --> 01:19:57.990
I'm takin' a look around this
joint. I'm gonna see what's goin' on.

01:20:13.259 --> 01:20:15.387
It's locked.
Locked?

01:20:15.462 --> 01:20:17.291
Have you any
extra keys, Miss?

01:20:17.331 --> 01:20:19.892
Yes, we have.
I'll get them.

01:20:24.307 --> 01:20:27.171
Dr Chumley, I went around the
house and climbed through the window.

01:20:27.211 --> 01:20:30.642
I didn't see anybody. Thank you,
Wilson. It's quite all right.

01:20:30.682 --> 01:20:34.115
Everything's in order,
thank you. I'll be all right.

01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:36.316
Dr Chumley,
if you need me, I'll…

01:20:36.390 --> 01:20:41.540
Holy smoke! We forgot about that crackpot.
He's probably roamin' around loose.

01:20:41.697 --> 01:20:43.892
Excuse me.

01:20:49.641 --> 01:20:52.202
I got 'im, Doctor.
Let's go upstairs.

01:20:52.278 --> 01:20:55.142
I wanna do your fingernails for
you. That's thoughtful of you.

01:20:55.182 --> 01:20:57.478
Just a second. I'll take
him. Thank you, Doctor.

01:20:57.518 --> 01:21:00.317
Oh, Miss Kelly.

01:21:00.389 --> 01:21:05.191
Perhaps you'd like this flower. I
seem to have misplaced my buttonhole.

01:21:05.261 --> 01:21:07.787
Thank you, Mr Dowd. Okay, let's go.

01:21:07.865 --> 01:21:10.266
<i>One moment, please.</i>

01:21:10.335 --> 01:21:14.204
<i>Ah, Dr Chumley. How nice
to run into you again.</i>

01:21:14.273 --> 01:21:17.707
How are you getting along
with Harvey? Oh, well, uh…

01:21:17.745 --> 01:21:21.010
Mr Dowd, I'd like to speak to
you in my office alone, please.

01:21:21.050 --> 01:21:25.382
I'd like that, too, but I just promised
this gentleman he could give me a manicure.

01:21:25.422 --> 01:21:30.374
Of course, if you wouldn't mind waiting
a few minutes. Not at all, Mr Dowd.

01:21:36.170 --> 01:21:37.967
Oh, excuse me.

01:21:38.038 --> 01:21:40.735
You first. Go ahead. Oh…

01:21:46.250 --> 01:21:50.210
Mr Dowd, won't you have a seat? Thank you.

01:21:52.458 --> 01:21:55.860
Will you have a cigar?
No, thank you, Doctor.

01:21:55.929 --> 01:21:58.330
Is there anything
I can do for you?

01:21:58.399 --> 01:22:00.800
What did you
have in mind?

01:22:00.869 --> 01:22:04.465
Mr Dowd, what kind
of a man are you?

01:22:04.540 --> 01:22:06.566
Where do you
come from?

01:22:06.644 --> 01:22:10.308
Why, didn't I… Didn't
I give you one of my cards?

01:22:10.382 --> 01:22:14.948
And where on the face of this tired
old earth did you find a thing like him?

01:22:14.988 --> 01:22:19.721
You mean, Harvey the Pooka? Yes, it's
true, the things you told me tonight.

01:22:19.761 --> 01:22:22.595
I know it now.
Yes, yes.

01:22:22.665 --> 01:22:26.693
Yes, Harvey has several
very interesting facets.

01:22:26.771 --> 01:22:29.798
Did I tell you about Mrs McElhinney? No.

01:22:29.875 --> 01:22:32.972
She lives right next door
to us. Wonderful woman.

01:22:33.012 --> 01:22:37.586
Harvey told me last night that
Mrs McElhinney's Aunt Rose…

01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:40.617
<i>was going to drop in
on her unexpectedly…</i>

01:22:40.657 --> 01:22:43.721
<i>this morning from Cleveland. And did she?</i>

01:22:43.761 --> 01:22:45.753
Did she what?

01:22:45.831 --> 01:22:50.633
Aunt Rose. Did she come,
just as Harvey said she would?

01:22:50.704 --> 01:22:52.639
Oh, yes, yes.

01:22:52.707 --> 01:22:56.038
These things always work out just
the way Harvey says they will.

01:22:56.078 --> 01:22:58.547
He's very,
very versatile.

01:22:58.614 --> 01:23:00.678
Did I tell you
he could stop clocks?

01:23:00.718 --> 01:23:02.812
To what purpose?

01:23:02.887 --> 01:23:06.419
You've heard the expression,
“His face would stop a clock.”

01:23:06.459 --> 01:23:10.021
Well, Harvey
can look at your clock…

01:23:10.097 --> 01:23:12.225
and stop it.

01:23:12.300 --> 01:23:15.497
And you can go anywhere you
like with anyone you like…

01:23:15.537 --> 01:23:17.562
and stay as long
as you like.

01:23:17.639 --> 01:23:22.578
And when you get back, not
one minute will have ticked by.

01:23:23.915 --> 01:23:25.940
You mean that he…
You see…

01:23:26.017 --> 01:23:30.615
He can… Science has
overcome time and space.

01:23:30.691 --> 01:23:35.527
Well, Harvey has overcome
not only time and space,

01:23:35.597 --> 01:23:38.431
but any objections.

01:23:38.501 --> 01:23:42.234
Flyspecks!
Flyspecks!

01:23:42.306 --> 01:23:44.870
I've been spending my life
among flyspects…

01:23:44.910 --> 01:23:49.109
while miracles have been leaning
on lampposts at 18th and Fairfax.

01:23:49.149 --> 01:23:52.415
Tell me, Mr Dowd,
will he do this for you?

01:23:52.486 --> 01:23:56.321
Oh, he'd be willing
at any time.

01:23:56.391 --> 01:24:01.194
But so far I haven't been able to
think of anyplace I'd rather be.

01:24:01.265 --> 01:24:06.705
I always have a wonderful time
wherever I am, whomever I'm with.

01:24:06.772 --> 01:24:09.302
I'm having a fine time
right here with you, Doctor.

01:24:09.342 --> 01:24:11.503
Oh.

01:24:11.578 --> 01:24:15.914
Oh, I…
I know where I'd go.

01:24:15.984 --> 01:24:18.112
Where?

01:24:18.188 --> 01:24:21.989
I'd go to Akron. Akron! Oh, yes.

01:24:22.059 --> 01:24:25.393
There's a cottage camp
just outside Akron…

01:24:25.464 --> 01:24:29.060
in a grove
of maple trees.

01:24:29.135 --> 01:24:33.665
Green, cool, beautiful.
That's my favorite tree.

01:24:33.741 --> 01:24:36.802
And I'd go there with a pretty woman. Oh.

01:24:36.879 --> 01:24:40.281
A strange woman,
a quiet woman.

01:24:40.350 --> 01:24:44.788
Oh, under a tree. I wouldn't
even want to know her name,

01:24:44.856 --> 01:24:48.954
while I would be just…
Mr Smith.

01:24:49.028 --> 01:24:52.658
Then I would send out
for cold beer.

01:24:52.733 --> 01:24:55.294
No whiskey, huh?
No.

01:24:55.370 --> 01:24:58.169
Then I would
tell her things.

01:24:58.241 --> 01:25:01.837
Things that I've never told
to anyone.

01:25:01.912 --> 01:25:05.405
Things that are locked deep…
in here.

01:25:07.386 --> 01:25:09.878
And as I talked
to her,

01:25:09.956 --> 01:25:14.724
I would want her to hold out
her soft white hand and say,

01:25:14.795 --> 01:25:20.429
“Poor thing.
You poor, poor thing.”

01:25:20.503 --> 01:25:23.837
How long would you want
this to go on, Doctor?

01:25:23.908 --> 01:25:27.107
Two weeks.
Two weeks?

01:25:27.179 --> 01:25:29.609
Wouldn't that get
a little monotonous,

01:25:29.649 --> 01:25:33.281
just Akron, cold beer and
“poor, poor thing” for two weeks?

01:25:33.321 --> 01:25:35.551
No!

01:25:35.623 --> 01:25:38.752
It would be wonderful.

01:25:38.827 --> 01:25:42.458
Well, I can't help feeling,
Doctor,

01:25:42.533 --> 01:25:46.595
that you're making a mistake
not allowing the woman to talk.

01:25:46.672 --> 01:25:51.438
If she'd been around at all, she might've
picked up some interesting news items.

01:25:51.478 --> 01:25:54.376
And I'm sure you're making a mistake
about all that beer and no whiskey,

01:25:54.416 --> 01:25:56.816
but it's
your two weeks.

01:25:56.885 --> 01:26:01.551
Mr Dowd, could he…
Would he do this for me?

01:26:01.625 --> 01:26:03.685
Oh, he could
and might.

01:26:03.761 --> 01:26:07.664
I've never heard Harvey
say a word against Akron.

01:26:07.733 --> 01:26:12.034
By the way, Doctor,
where is Harvey?

01:26:12.105 --> 01:26:14.040
Don't you know?

01:26:14.108 --> 01:26:17.340
The last time I saw him
he was with you.

01:26:17.412 --> 01:26:20.143
He's probably waiting for me
down at Charlie's.

01:26:20.183 --> 01:26:23.213
Yes, that's it. He's
down at Charlie's. Uh-huh.

01:26:23.253 --> 01:26:26.184
In that case, I'll go down
and join him for a nightcap.

01:26:26.224 --> 01:26:29.221
Fortunately, Charlie's
stays open rather late.

01:26:29.261 --> 01:26:32.092
Excuse me, Doctor. I want to say good-bye
to some of my friends before I leave.

01:26:32.132 --> 01:26:34.762
Mr Dowd, none of those people
are your friends.

01:26:34.802 --> 01:26:38.334
But I want you to know that I am
your friend. Thank you. And I'm yours.

01:26:38.374 --> 01:26:40.866
They underestimate you,
as I did.

01:26:40.944 --> 01:26:44.442
This sister of yours is at the
bottom of a conspiracy against you.

01:26:44.482 --> 01:26:47.679
She's trying to persuade me to lock you up.
Today she had commitment papers drawn up.

01:26:47.719 --> 01:26:50.316
She has your power of attorney
and the key to your safety box.

01:26:50.356 --> 01:26:52.291
And she brought
you here!

01:26:52.359 --> 01:26:56.992
My sister did all that in one afternoon?
That Veta certainly is a whirlwind, isn't she?

01:26:57.032 --> 01:27:00.162
Good heavens, man! Haven't
you any righteous indignation?

01:27:00.203 --> 01:27:02.467
Oh, Doctor, I…

01:27:02.539 --> 01:27:06.500
Years ago my mother used
to say to me, she'd say,

01:27:06.578 --> 01:27:09.206
“In this world, Elwood,
you must be…”

01:27:09.282 --> 01:27:11.307
She always
called me Elwood.

01:27:11.384 --> 01:27:15.982
“In this world, Elwood,
you must be oh, so smart…

01:27:16.058 --> 01:27:18.151
or oh, so pleasant.”

01:27:18.226 --> 01:27:20.923
Well, for years
I was smart.

01:27:20.997 --> 01:27:23.330
I recommend pleasant.

01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:26.802
<i>And you may quote me.</i>

01:27:38.620 --> 01:27:41.818
This is it.
Here we are.

01:27:41.891 --> 01:27:44.690
Okay, thank you.
Come on, Myrtle.

01:27:44.762 --> 01:27:46.892
I'll come… You wait
right here, Veta girl.

01:27:46.932 --> 01:27:49.128
I will not wait here.
I'm going in with you.

01:27:49.168 --> 01:27:51.565
You're a very high-strung girl.
This may be an ordeal.

01:27:51.605 --> 01:27:53.869
Then let Myrtle Mae
stay here too.

01:27:53.941 --> 01:27:59.942
Mother, you know it isn't right to put Uncle
Elwood away without some blood relative present.

01:27:59.982 --> 01:28:02.179
Hey, you're not gonna leave
the lady here. I thought…

01:28:02.219 --> 01:28:05.916
See, Omar? Even strangers
think I should go in with you.

01:28:07.092 --> 01:28:09.117
I wish to see
Dr Chumley.

01:28:09.194 --> 01:28:11.725
I'm sorry, sir. He's in
conference. You'll have to wait.

01:28:11.765 --> 01:28:15.764
After dragging me out of bed at this
hour? Tell him Judge Omar Gaffney's here.

01:28:15.804 --> 01:28:19.268
I telephoned you right after we
picked up Mr Dowd. I'm Dr Sanderson.

01:28:19.308 --> 01:28:21.805
I demand that this matter
be settled right now!

01:28:21.845 --> 01:28:24.644
Oh, good, nobody here
but people.

01:28:24.716 --> 01:28:28.314
You promised to wait in the car.
You forgot Elwood's bathrobe.

01:28:28.354 --> 01:28:31.787
Why are you all standing
around? I thought you'd be…

01:28:31.792 --> 01:28:36.093
How do you do, Doctor? Committing
Elwood. Hello, Mrs Simmons.

01:28:36.164 --> 01:28:39.157
He's the one
I told you about.

01:28:39.234 --> 01:28:42.033
Girl. Doctor,
what's your opinion?

01:28:42.105 --> 01:28:44.034
How are you feeling, Mrs
Simmons? Better, thank you.

01:28:44.074 --> 01:28:47.472
In my opinion, Elwood P. Dowd is suffering
from a third-degree hallucination.

01:28:47.512 --> 01:28:49.981
I recommend formula
number 9-7-7.

01:28:50.049 --> 01:28:52.613
That's a powerful serum which
will shock him back to reality.

01:28:52.653 --> 01:28:54.616
Nothing will do that.
Lock him up.

01:28:54.656 --> 01:28:58.521
If this shock formula brings people back
to reality, that's where we want Elwood.

01:28:58.561 --> 01:29:01.925
Yes. If he won't see the
rabbit anymore, give it to him.

01:29:01.965 --> 01:29:04.796
Then when Harvey comes
to the door, I'll deal with him.

01:29:04.836 --> 01:29:08.167
Please stop talking about Harvey
as if there were such a thing!

01:29:08.207 --> 01:29:12.038
Myrtle Mae, you have a lot to
learn, and I hope you never learn it.

01:29:12.078 --> 01:29:16.346
Oh, Mother… Marvin! Myrtle Mae, baby!

01:29:16.418 --> 01:29:20.913
Myrtle Mae, come back here.
The idea of that terrible man…

01:29:20.990 --> 01:29:24.221
Let's get on with this, Doctor. I'm sorry, but
you'll have to take that up with Dr Chumley.

01:29:24.261 --> 01:29:26.730
Then why waste my time?
Young lady,

01:29:26.798 --> 01:29:29.495
will you inform Dr Chumley
of my presence or must I do it?

01:29:29.535 --> 01:29:31.846
I'll attend to it
immediately, sir.

01:29:38.035 --> 01:29:39.663
Oh.
Oh, Miss Kelly.

01:29:39.737 --> 01:29:42.200
Isn't Dr Chumley there?
How nice to see you.

01:29:42.240 --> 01:29:44.573
Where's the Doctor?
What'd you…

01:29:44.643 --> 01:29:48.605
Are you all right, Doctor? Yes,
thanks. I'm quite all right.

01:29:48.683 --> 01:29:51.814
Well, Veta and Myrtle Mae!
What a delightful surprise.

01:29:51.854 --> 01:29:56.315
Good evening, Elwood. I brought
your bathrobe. Thank you, Veta.

01:29:56.392 --> 01:30:00.797
Well, Dr Chumley, are we gonna
settle this matter or are we not?

01:30:00.866 --> 01:30:03.836
I, uh… I've turned
this case over…

01:30:03.903 --> 01:30:08.235
<i>to Dr Sanderson. Oh, no. You forget
I don't work here anymore, Dr Chumley.</i>

01:30:08.275 --> 01:30:10.905
Dr Sanderson, please disregard
what I said this afternoon.

01:30:10.945 --> 01:30:14.343
I want you to head my staff. I think
you're a very capable young man.

01:30:14.383 --> 01:30:17.148
Oh, Lyman,
did you hear that?

01:30:17.220 --> 01:30:20.850
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have some work to do.

01:30:28.569 --> 01:30:30.832
Well, I think this calls
for a celebration.

01:30:30.872 --> 01:30:34.237
Why don't we all go down to
Charlie's Place and have a drink?

01:30:34.277 --> 01:30:37.741
You're not going anywhere,
Elwood. You're staying right there.

01:30:37.781 --> 01:30:40.945
Yes, Uncle Elwood.
Stay here, son.

01:30:41.019 --> 01:30:43.614
I plan to leave,
you want me to stay.

01:30:43.689 --> 01:30:46.419
An element of conflict in any
discussion is a very good thing.

01:30:46.459 --> 01:30:50.794
Shows everybody's taking part,
and nobody left out. I like that.

01:30:50.865 --> 01:30:53.494
Ah, Miss Kelly.

01:30:53.569 --> 01:30:56.299
Miss Kelly, you know,
when you wear my flower…

01:30:56.339 --> 01:30:58.274
you make it beautiful.

01:30:58.342 --> 01:31:02.609
“A diviner grace has never
brightened this enchanting face.”

01:31:02.681 --> 01:31:06.744
Ovid's Fifth Elegy. Ovid's
always been my favorite poet.

01:31:06.820 --> 01:31:09.149
My dear,
you'll never look lovelier.

01:31:09.189 --> 01:31:11.988
I'll never be happier,
Mr Dowd. I know it.

01:31:14.163 --> 01:31:16.804
Hey, this rabbit gag
must be a good one.

01:31:16.833 --> 01:31:21.833
Mr Dowd, I have a formula, 9-7-7, that
will be good for you. Will you take it?

01:31:21.873 --> 01:31:23.932
9-7-7, huh? Yes.
It's a serum.

01:31:24.009 --> 01:31:26.105
Oh. You won't see this rabbit anymore.

01:31:26.145 --> 01:31:30.244
But you will see your responsibilities
and your duties. Uh-huh.

01:31:30.284 --> 01:31:32.845
Well, Doctor,
if you thought of this,

01:31:32.921 --> 01:31:35.318
I'm sure it must be
a very fine thing.

01:31:35.358 --> 01:31:39.656
And if I happen to run into anybody who
needs it, I'd be glad to recommend it.

01:31:39.697 --> 01:31:42.293
But as for myself, I don't
think I'd care for it.

01:31:42.333 --> 01:31:44.530
You hear that, Judge?
You hear that, Doctor?

01:31:44.570 --> 01:31:47.834
That's what we put up with.
Veta, do you want me to take this?

01:31:47.874 --> 01:31:50.571
Oh, Elwood, I'm only
thinking of you.

01:31:50.645 --> 01:31:55.311
You're my brother and I've known you
for years. I'd do anything for you.

01:31:55.351 --> 01:31:59.049
Harvey wouldn't do anything for
you. He's making a fool of you.

01:31:59.089 --> 01:32:02.457
Elwood, don't be a fool. I won't.

01:32:02.527 --> 01:32:05.053
Why, you could amount
to something.

01:32:05.131 --> 01:32:08.662
You could be sitting on the Western
Slope Water Board right now…

01:32:08.702 --> 01:32:11.013
if you'd only go over
and ask them.

01:32:11.039 --> 01:32:14.870
If that's what you want, Harvey and
I'll go over tomorrow and ask them.

01:32:14.910 --> 01:32:18.141
Tomorrow! I wish there might
never be another tomorrow!

01:32:18.181 --> 01:32:21.445
Not if Myrtle Mae and I have to
go on living with that rabbit!

01:32:21.485 --> 01:32:25.818
Our friends never come to see us
anymore. We have no social life whatever!

01:32:25.858 --> 01:32:27.986
We've no life
at all.

01:32:28.062 --> 01:32:31.464
We're both
perfectly miserable.

01:32:31.533 --> 01:32:35.129
But perhaps you don't
care. All right, now, Veta.

01:32:39.476 --> 01:32:42.105
Well, I…

01:32:42.180 --> 01:32:47.449
I've always felt Veta should
have everything she wants, but…

01:32:49.356 --> 01:32:51.290
Veta,
are you sure?

01:32:51.358 --> 01:32:53.486
Yes.

01:32:57.166 --> 01:33:01.332
I-I'll take it. Where do I go,
Doctor? In my office, Mr Dowd.

01:33:01.406 --> 01:33:04.971
This will only take a few
minutes. Why don't you wait?

01:33:07.814 --> 01:33:12.898
Veta, you tell Dr Chumley to say good-bye
to the old fellow for me, will you?

01:33:15.758 --> 01:33:18.125
Dr Sanderson,
couldn't we…

01:33:18.194 --> 01:33:21.096
Yes, Kelly?
Nothing.

01:33:21.165 --> 01:33:24.070
I'll need you
to give me a hand, Miss Kelly.

01:33:27.740 --> 01:33:29.703
Right in here. No, no. After you.

01:33:29.743 --> 01:33:31.712
No, after you.

01:33:33.014 --> 01:33:35.677
Miss Kelly. No, after you. Here we go.

01:33:46.399 --> 01:33:50.393
Dr Sanderson said
it wouldn't take long.

01:33:50.471 --> 01:33:53.498
Ooh, ooh!

01:33:53.575 --> 01:33:57.273
Sit down, girl. Thank you, Judge.

01:33:57.346 --> 01:34:00.805
He said it wouldn't take…
long.

01:34:00.884 --> 01:34:03.547
Relax, girl.
Take it easy.

01:34:03.621 --> 01:34:05.783
Thank you.
I'll try to, but…

01:34:10.798 --> 01:34:15.264
Oh, there you are. Lady jumped out
of my cab, left without payin' me.

01:34:15.304 --> 01:34:18.701
She didn't say anything, and a
fellow gets nervous after a while.

01:34:18.741 --> 01:34:22.770
Well, there's no cause for
concern, man. How much is it?

01:34:22.848 --> 01:34:26.285
All the way out there
from town? $2.75.

01:34:26.352 --> 01:34:29.117
Why, I must've forgotten
my wallet.

01:34:29.189 --> 01:34:34.123
I was dragged out of bed in such a hurry,
it's a wonder I didn't forget my pants.

01:34:34.163 --> 01:34:36.097
Beg your pardon,
Veta.

01:34:36.165 --> 01:34:39.431
Uh, would you take a
check? We don't take checks.

01:34:39.502 --> 01:34:41.766
Yeah, I know, but…
Would you mind, Veta?

01:34:41.806 --> 01:34:45.834
Oh, of course.
Yes, I, uh…

01:34:45.911 --> 01:34:50.475
Well, I could've sworn
I brought my coin purse.

01:34:50.551 --> 01:34:52.884
Where is it?

01:34:52.954 --> 01:34:55.788
Oh, the idea!

01:35:06.605 --> 01:35:09.234
Well, I never!

01:35:12.079 --> 01:35:15.880
Oh, I know. I'll get it
for you from my brother.

01:35:15.951 --> 01:35:19.783
But I can't go in just now. He's
in there getting an injection.

01:35:19.823 --> 01:35:22.387
It won't take long.
You'll have to wait.

01:35:22.427 --> 01:35:24.756
You're gonna get my money from
your brother who's in there…

01:35:24.796 --> 01:35:26.893
getting some of that stuff
they shoot out here?

01:35:26.933 --> 01:35:29.029
Yes. It'll only take
a few minutes.

01:35:29.069 --> 01:35:33.434
Lady, I want my money now. I told
you it'll only take a few minutes.

01:35:33.474 --> 01:35:35.471
We want you to drive us
back to town.

01:35:35.511 --> 01:35:39.709
I told you I want my money now or I'm nosin'
the cab back to town and you can wait for a bus.

01:35:39.749 --> 01:35:43.482
Well, of all the pigheaded,
stubborn things!

01:35:43.555 --> 01:35:46.018
What's the matter with you?
Nothing that $2.75 won't fix.

01:35:46.058 --> 01:35:49.223
You heard me.
Take it or leave it.

01:35:49.296 --> 01:35:53.700
I never heard of anything so
unreasonable in all my life.

01:36:00.744 --> 01:36:03.808
Would you please let my
brother step out here a moment?

01:36:03.848 --> 01:36:07.080
This cab driver won't wait.
Oh, Elwood.

01:36:07.152 --> 01:36:09.587
I'll be right back.

01:36:09.656 --> 01:36:11.852
Elwood, I came off
without my coin purse.

01:36:11.892 --> 01:36:15.226
Would you please give
this man $2.75?

01:36:15.297 --> 01:36:18.361
But don't give him any more.
He's been very rude.

01:36:18.401 --> 01:36:21.462
Howdy do. Dowd's my name, Elwood P.

01:36:21.538 --> 01:36:24.669
Mine's Lofgren, E.J.
Glad to know you, Mr Lofgren.

01:36:24.709 --> 01:36:29.142
This is my sister Mrs Simmons. My
good friend Judge Gaffney, back there.

01:36:29.182 --> 01:36:31.276
Hi. Hi.
Hi.

01:36:31.352 --> 01:36:34.115
Have you lived around
here long? All my life.

01:36:34.155 --> 01:36:36.624
Enjoy your work?
It's okay.

01:36:36.692 --> 01:36:38.888
I've been driving
for Apex Cabs for 15 years.

01:36:38.928 --> 01:36:41.425
My brother Joe's been driving
for Brown Cabs for near 12.

01:36:41.465 --> 01:36:44.596
Is that so? You drive for Apex
and your brother Joe for Brown.

01:36:44.636 --> 01:36:47.277
That's interesting, isn't it, Veta? Yes.

01:36:47.306 --> 01:36:50.435
Mr Lofgren, let me give you
one of my cards.

01:36:50.511 --> 01:36:54.442
My sister and my charming niece
live at that address with me.

01:36:54.482 --> 01:36:57.513
Wouldn't you and your brother like to
come and have dinner with us sometime?

01:36:57.553 --> 01:36:59.647
Sure,
be glad to.

01:36:59.723 --> 01:37:01.885
When? When would you
be glad to?

01:37:01.959 --> 01:37:05.357
I couldn't come any night but tomorrow.
I'm on duty all the rest of the week.

01:37:05.397 --> 01:37:08.561
Tomorrow would be perfect. We'll be
expecting you and delighted to see you.

01:37:08.601 --> 01:37:12.333
Won't we, Veta? Elwood, I'm sure
this man has friends of his own.

01:37:12.373 --> 01:37:14.308
Can't have
too many friends.

01:37:14.376 --> 01:37:17.040
Don't keep the Doctor waiting.
It's rude.

01:37:17.080 --> 01:37:20.511
There you are. Keep the change. I'm
glad to have met you, Mr Lofgren.

01:37:20.551 --> 01:37:25.965
I'll expect you and your brother tomorrow
night. Now, you'll have to excuse me. I…

01:37:28.662 --> 01:37:31.290
A sweet guy.
Certainly.

01:37:31.365 --> 01:37:34.733
You could just as well have waited. Ah, no.

01:37:34.803 --> 01:37:38.001
Lady, I've been drivin'
this route for 15 years.

01:37:38.074 --> 01:37:42.073
I've brought 'em out here to get that stuff,
and I've drove 'em home after they had it.

01:37:42.113 --> 01:37:44.878
It changes them.
I certainly hope so.

01:37:44.950 --> 01:37:47.681
You ain't kiddin'.
On the way out here,

01:37:47.753 --> 01:37:50.684
they sit back and enjoy
the ride, they talk to me.

01:37:50.724 --> 01:37:54.055
Sometimes we stop and watch the
sunsets and look at the birds.

01:37:54.095 --> 01:37:56.892
Sometimes we stop and watch the
birds when there ain't no birds,

01:37:56.932 --> 01:37:59.096
and look at the sunsets
when it's rainin'.

01:37:59.136 --> 01:38:02.800
We have a swell time.
And I always get a big tip.

01:38:02.874 --> 01:38:04.968
But afterwards…
ooh-ooh.

01:38:05.043 --> 01:38:09.109
“Afterwards, ooh-ooh.” What do
you mean, “Afterwards, ooh-ooh”?

01:38:09.149 --> 01:38:11.880
They crab, crab, crab.
They yell at me,

01:38:11.952 --> 01:38:14.616
“Watch the lights! Watch the
breaks! Watch the intersections!”

01:38:14.656 --> 01:38:18.754
They scream at me to hurry. They
got no faith in me and my buggy.

01:38:18.794 --> 01:38:23.094
Yet, it's the same cab, same driver, and
we're going back over the very same road.

01:38:23.134 --> 01:38:25.068
It's no fun.
And, no tips.

01:38:25.136 --> 01:38:28.502
My brother would've tipped
you anyway. He's very generous.

01:38:28.542 --> 01:38:32.172
He always has been. Not
after this he won't be.

01:38:32.246 --> 01:38:35.614
After this he'll be
a perfectly normal human being.

01:38:35.684 --> 01:38:38.313
And you know what stinkers
they are.

01:38:38.388 --> 01:38:40.619
Glad I met ya.
I'll wait.

01:38:43.027 --> 01:38:46.658
Oh, no! No!
Elwood, come out.

01:38:46.732 --> 01:38:50.863
Don't give it to him! Stop
it! Stop it! Elwood, come out.

01:38:50.938 --> 01:38:53.468
Don't do that, girl. Dr
Sanderson's giving the injection.

01:38:53.508 --> 01:38:56.472
I don't want him to have it.
I don't like people like that.

01:38:56.512 --> 01:38:59.576
I don't want my brother
to be like that. Elwood!

01:38:59.616 --> 01:39:03.485
Oh, you haven't given him the
injection already, have you?

01:39:03.554 --> 01:39:07.321
No, but we're all ready,
Mrs Simmons. Oh, Elwood!

01:39:07.392 --> 01:39:09.522
What's the trouble?

01:39:09.656 --> 01:39:11.955
What's goin' on?
What's wrong?

01:39:12.026 --> 01:39:14.356
She wants to stop the
injection. She does, huh?

01:39:14.396 --> 01:39:17.161
Come on, you. Take your hands off me!

01:39:17.233 --> 01:39:19.830
Don't you touch me,
you white slaver, you!

01:39:19.870 --> 01:39:23.329
Marvin, please! All right,
honey. Anything you say.

01:39:23.408 --> 01:39:25.805
You don't know what you want. You
didn't want that rabbit either.

01:39:25.845 --> 01:39:27.779
What's wrong with Harvey?

01:39:27.847 --> 01:39:31.546
If Elwood and Myrtle Mae and I want
to live with Harvey, what is it to you?

01:39:31.586 --> 01:39:35.182
You don't even have to
come around. It's our house.

01:39:35.257 --> 01:39:38.819
Elwood! Oh, Elwood. Veta, that's all right.

01:39:38.895 --> 01:39:41.192
Veta's all tired out.
She's done a lot today.

01:39:41.232 --> 01:39:44.062
Have it your own way, but I'm
gonna take that cab back to town.

01:39:44.102 --> 01:39:47.767
I'm not giving up another night's sleep
again no matter how big the animal is!

01:39:47.807 --> 01:39:50.140
Elwood,
let us go too.

01:39:50.210 --> 01:39:53.442
I hate this place.
I wish I'd never seen it.

01:39:53.515 --> 01:39:56.750
All right, Veta. Wait
'til I get my hat and coat.

01:40:00.157 --> 01:40:04.254
Why…
Why look at that!

01:40:04.329 --> 01:40:07.128
It's my coin purse.

01:40:07.199 --> 01:40:10.067
It must've been in there
all the time.

01:40:10.136 --> 01:40:15.098
I could've paid
that cab driver myself.

01:40:15.177 --> 01:40:17.942
Harvey!

01:40:22.821 --> 01:40:25.016
Thank you, Doctor.

01:40:25.090 --> 01:40:27.150
Ooh!
Myrtle Mae and that man!

01:40:27.226 --> 01:40:29.289
They make a beautiful couple,
don't they?

01:40:29.329 --> 01:40:32.627
Mr Wilson has such a dynamic
personality. That man…

01:40:32.667 --> 01:40:35.569
Myrtle Mae…
Mr Wilson, may we have…

01:40:35.637 --> 01:40:37.867
the pleasure of your company
tomorrow night for dinner?

01:40:37.907 --> 01:40:40.503
We're having a few friends in.
Very informal.

01:40:40.543 --> 01:40:43.742
Certainly, Mr Dowd. I'd
be glad to. Thank you.

01:40:43.815 --> 01:40:45.749
A very nice couple.

01:40:45.817 --> 01:40:49.117
And you make
a very beautiful couple too.

01:40:49.188 --> 01:40:52.090
Well,
I must find Harvey.

01:40:52.159 --> 01:40:55.290
Good-bye, Mrs Simmons.
I'll see you tomorrow night.

01:40:55.330 --> 01:40:59.132
Yes. Good-bye,
Mr Wilson.

01:40:59.202 --> 01:41:02.036
Myrtle Mae!

01:41:04.041 --> 01:41:08.912
Come, Myrtle Mae. Please try to forget
all about that dreadful Mr Wilson.

01:41:11.619 --> 01:41:16.114
Wha… Wha…
Well, there you are!

01:41:17.593 --> 01:41:21.724
I've been looking
all over for you.

01:41:21.799 --> 01:41:25.702
Oh. Wasn't it cold
out here?

01:41:28.007 --> 01:41:32.742
Hmm? I…
I don't mind if I do.

01:41:32.814 --> 01:41:36.182
That'd warm us up,
wouldn't it?

01:41:36.251 --> 01:41:39.619
No, Charlie's would be
fine. Yeah, just fine.

01:41:42.827 --> 01:41:45.228
<i>Here.
Oh, Mr Dowd?</i>

01:41:45.297 --> 01:41:49.632
Mr Dowd, don't take him
away. Let him stay with me.

01:41:49.702 --> 01:41:54.607
Doctor, whatever he wants to do
is perfectly all right with me.

01:41:54.676 --> 01:41:57.168
He knows that.
It's up to you.

01:41:57.246 --> 01:42:00.512
Would you like to stay
with the doctor? Hmm?

01:42:03.287 --> 01:42:07.054
No, I-I don't mind.

01:42:12.900 --> 01:42:15.836
Have you ever been
to Akron?

01:42:15.904 --> 01:42:19.238
Hmm? Akron.

01:42:33.594 --> 01:42:37.759
Now, where is Elwood? Elwood,
we've been waiting for you.

01:42:37.833 --> 01:42:40.763
I'm sorry, Veta. We've lost
the car. The Judge took it.

01:42:40.803 --> 01:42:43.267
We'll have to go to the
corner and wait for a bus.

01:42:43.307 --> 01:42:45.936
Hurry up, dear.

01:42:46.011 --> 01:42:49.106
Good night, Mr Shimelplatzer. Good night.

01:42:55.023 --> 01:42:57.788
Was anything
the matter?

01:42:57.860 --> 01:43:02.094
No, I, I thought you decided
to stay with Dr Chumley.

01:43:02.700 --> 01:43:05.329
You… Huh?

01:43:05.404 --> 01:43:08.203
You…

01:43:08.274 --> 01:43:10.834
Well, thank you,
Harvey.

01:43:10.911 --> 01:43:13.812
I prefer you too.
