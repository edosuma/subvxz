So now aphrodisiacs are part of chicks' night?

00:15.683 --> 00:16.725
That's right. Come on.

00:16.809 --> 00:18.519
I just finished telling someone

00:18.602 --> 00:19.687
that I was the complication.

00:19.770 --> 00:21.480
What someone? Ruby.

00:21.563 --> 00:23.148
Fuck this.

00:24.358 --> 00:26.568
What the hell happened to you?

00:26.652 --> 00:27.611
I've been staying at my brother's place.

00:27.695 --> 00:30.197
Okay, this is unsettling.

00:32.825 --> 00:33.993
Hi.

00:34.075 --> 00:35.828
There's a perfect shit storm brewing.

00:35.911 --> 00:38.580
So, please, I'm asking you to come back with me.

00:38.664 --> 00:41.792
I'm gonna ask you again. Is that what Emma wants?

00:41.876 --> 00:43.210
'Cause I haven't heard from her.

00:43.293 --> 00:45.295
If you and the professor chick had stayed together,

00:45.379 --> 00:46.797
you would have three kids and be the dean

00:46.881 --> 00:48.590
of Hamilton High School right now,

00:48.674 --> 00:50.634
instead of smoking away your hangover with your nephew.

00:50.718 --> 00:51.802
The dean is interested in hearing

00:51.886 --> 00:53.554
your student-services pitch.

00:53.637 --> 00:55.514
Maybe I can thank you for real by

00:55.597 --> 00:57.808
taking you out to dinner tomorrow night.

00:55.597 --> 00:57.808
Are you asking me on a date?

00:57.892 --> 00:58.893
Clomid time.

00:58.976 --> 01:00.686
You must really want a kid.

01:00.769 --> 01:01.854
I must.

01:01.937 --> 01:03.939
Yay. Right?

01:04.023 --> 01:05.649
Were you hoping for something different?

01:05.733 --> 01:07.192
Not when I bought them.

01:07.275 --> 01:10.738
I am more profoundly fucked in the head than I thought.

01:13.574 --> 01:16.869
♪♪

01:24.710 --> 01:26.879
Cool, right? Mm. Yeah, cool.

01:26.962 --> 01:29.548
But, um, in a very specific way,

01:26.962 --> 01:29.548
you know?

01:29.631 --> 01:31.717
Can't -- can't quite put my finger on it.

01:31.800 --> 01:33.052
Mm. Kind of a chick's place.

01:33.134 --> 01:34.553
Is that what you mean? Mm, I'd say more of

01:34.636 --> 01:35.637
a chicks-with-chicks place.

01:35.721 --> 01:36.805
Oh, like you and me.

01:36.889 --> 01:38.640
Yes. Exactly like you and me.

01:38.724 --> 01:39.767
If we were a couple of lesbians

01:39.850 --> 01:41.560
like everyone else in the place.

01:41.643 --> 01:44.354
You think? Eh, I don't know. Maybe.

01:45.689 --> 01:48.067
Probably. So, it's popular with lesbians.

01:48.901 --> 01:50.611
Actually, if you Yelp it --

01:50.694 --> 01:53.822
which, you know, I did, and I bet you did, too --

01:53.906 --> 01:56.617
it doesn't say "Kombucha bar popular with lesbians."

01:56.700 --> 01:58.077
It says "Lesbian kombucha bar."

01:58.159 --> 02:00.829
My review will say, "One Tegan and Sara song away

02:00.913 --> 02:02.748
from being<i> the</i> most lesbian place on Earth."

02:02.831 --> 02:05.834
Like a lesbian epicenter.

02:05.918 --> 02:07.878
Which I guess would be a vagina.

02:07.962 --> 02:10.881
Face it, Carm. This room is a giant vagina.

02:10.965 --> 02:11.924
What are you up to?

02:12.007 --> 02:13.258
Up to? Mm-hmm.

02:13.341 --> 02:14.843
I have no idea what you're talking about.

02:14.927 --> 02:16.929
Carmen. Fine. This is --

02:17.012 --> 02:18.764
this is me being...

02:18.847 --> 02:20.766
You know, cool with it.

02:20.849 --> 02:23.852
Yeah, but this -- this place isn't polyamorous or bisexual.

02:23.936 --> 02:25.938
It's, like, clearly for avowed lesbians.

02:26.021 --> 02:27.648
Well, there weren't any bisexual

02:27.731 --> 02:29.608
or polyamorous lunch places on Yelp.

02:29.691 --> 02:31.068
Cut me some slack. I'm making an effort.

02:32.945 --> 02:35.739
That's true. Thank you.

02:38.993 --> 02:40.786
Izzy's not gay-gay.

02:40.869 --> 02:42.871
I know that for sure.

02:42.955 --> 02:44.665
Wait a second, but you're not for sure about you?

02:44.748 --> 02:46.041
Is that what you're saying?

02:46.125 --> 02:47.668
It took a decade of heteronormative marriage

02:47.751 --> 02:48.836
and one sex fairy to figure out

02:48.919 --> 02:50.838
that you're, like, gay

02:52.756 --> 02:54.925
If I did that to Jack...

02:56.802 --> 02:57.970
He wants a family.

02:58.053 --> 03:00.263
He always has.

03:00.806 --> 03:02.808
So does Izzy, as it turns out.

03:02.891 --> 03:04.726
And you... do...

03:04.810 --> 03:06.227
too?

03:11.066 --> 03:13.944
I'm so fucking scared, Carm.

03:14.028 --> 03:16.864
I feel like...

03:16.947 --> 03:18.740
I feel like I've just been, you know,

03:18.824 --> 03:20.909
drifting along and playing along.

03:20.993 --> 03:22.870
And then this alarm went off,

03:22.953 --> 03:24.872
and I woke up in the middle of my life.

03:24.955 --> 03:28.750
I have no fucking clue who I am or --

03:28.834 --> 03:33.380
or what I want, like, sexually, professionally...

03:34.882 --> 03:36.424
or reproductively.

03:37.843 --> 03:39.720
Damn.

03:39.803 --> 03:41.930
Wow. You're gonna give me a nervous breakdown.

03:42.014 --> 03:43.849
You think I'm having a nervous breakdown?

03:43.932 --> 03:46.935
You think that I'm so confused

03:43.932 --> 03:46.935
and guilt-ridden

03:47.019 --> 03:48.645
that I'm driving myself over the edge?

Ah, you've wedged a lot of zany...

10:33.383 --> 10:34.426
And it's disgusting.

10:34.509 --> 10:36.344
Mm.

10:36.428 --> 10:37.971
That's legally poison.

10:38.054 --> 10:39.389
Told ya. It's good for you.

10:39.473 --> 10:41.391
So, what did Kylie say to give you

10:41.475 --> 10:45.228
the glossy

10:45.312 --> 10:47.147
Apparently, um,

10:47.230 --> 10:49.316
everyone at Pinnacle is "buzzing" about me.

10:49.399 --> 10:51.443
What! I'm buzzworthy.

10:51.526 --> 10:54.195
That's amazing, Em.

10:54.279 --> 10:55.280
Good for you.

10:55.363 --> 10:57.282
It is such a prestigious firm.

10:57.365 --> 10:59.284
They have so many cool projects with real budgets,

10:59.367 --> 11:00.994
do amazing things.

11:01.077 --> 11:03.955
They take shits bigger than Shepherd &amp; Monro.

11:06.416 --> 11:08.126
So...

11:08.209 --> 11:09.377
Just so we're on the same page,

11:09.461 --> 11:12.297
are you still just crazy flattered,

11:12.380 --> 11:16.009
or have you crossed into seriously considering this?

11:18.219 --> 11:19.513
I-I don't know.

11:21.473 --> 11:23.391
Uh...

11:23.475 --> 11:26.353
Have you talked to Jack?

11:26.436 --> 11:28.271
Excuse me?

11:29.481 --> 11:31.483
I'll talk to Jack when he comes back home

11:31.566 --> 11:34.444
and apologizes to both of us.

11:34.902 --> 11:36.530
Remember? Yeah...

11:36.613 --> 11:40.367
Upon deeper reflection, is that really fair?

11:40.450 --> 11:42.536
Is it fair?

11:42.619 --> 11:45.413
Are you fucking kidding me?

11:45.497 --> 11:48.166
He told half the town I'm gay.

11:48.249 --> 11:51.169
He had an emotional affair with his ex-girlfriend.

11:51.252 --> 11:53.254
He left us -- both of us.

11:53.338 --> 11:56.299
Is it fucking fair? Well, I'm pretty sure that

11:56.383 --> 11:59.344
he sees things differently.

12:06.267 --> 12:07.726
You saw him.

12:09.354 --> 12:10.647
No.

12:10.771 --> 12:12.357
Deny it.

12:12.440 --> 12:14.442
I just did.

12:14.526 --> 12:17.362
Well, then, what, do you speculate,

12:17.445 --> 12:19.280
would be his different take on things?

12:19.364 --> 12:21.199
Off the top of my head? Mm-hmm.

12:21.282 --> 12:24.578
Maybe he'd say that we're less a throuple

12:24.661 --> 12:27.372
and more a lesbian couple with a dude hovering

12:27.455 --> 12:30.542
around the perimeter not taking a hint.

12:30.625 --> 12:32.377
Hmm. But that's --

12:32.460 --> 12:34.254
that's pure speculation.

12:34.337 --> 12:36.464
Jesus, just blink already.

12:36.548 --> 12:38.466
It doesn't mean that you lost.

12:38.550 --> 12:40.427
This isn't a fucking game, Emma.

12:40.510 --> 12:42.262
Okay. Izzy, I'm sorry.

12:42.345 --> 12:44.514
At least I care.

12:44.598 --> 12:46.474
Hey, I care.

12:47.308 --> 12:48.851
I care.

12:49.561 --> 12:51.187
I care.

12:58.695 --> 13:00.572
Don't be mad, okay?

13:04.451 --> 13:06.035
I did see Jack.

13:06.119 --> 13:09.414
Well, yeah. You're a terrible liar.

13:09.497 --> 13:11.583
I get that a lot.

13:11.666 --> 13:14.461
I tried to convince him to come back.

13:14.544 --> 13:16.504
Clearly it didn't work, which is humiliating.

13:16.588 --> 13:18.423
And now I'm afraid that you're both gonna leave me alone

13:18.506 --> 13:21.175
with lots of spare time to hate myself.

13:22.677 --> 13:26.805
You went to go get him, bring him home, and he...

13:27.599 --> 13:29.808
He refused?

13:36.608 --> 13:38.359
This one an orange? She's got a real eye.

13:38.443 --> 13:39.653
I'm noticing she likes --

13:39.736 --> 13:41.362
I don't think he's ever coming home, Carm.

13:41.446 --> 13:43.573
Like, ever.

13:43.657 --> 13:46.326
Okay, uh

13:46.409 --> 13:47.868
It's ju-- it's on the counter. Right there.

13:47.952 --> 13:50.371
Hon, why don't you take the kids up

13:47.952 --> 13:50.371
to bed now, okay?

13:50.455 --> 13:51.623
Oh. Hi. Yeah, okay.

13:51.706 --> 13:53.458
They just had a nap a half hour ago,

13:53.541 --> 13:55.627
but, sure, kids are stupid, right?

13:55.710 --> 13:58.296
Yeah.

13:55.710 --> 13:58.296
Let's go.

13:58.379 --> 13:59.798
Come on, baby. Grab your crayons. Come on.

13:59.880 --> 14:01.466
I'll take a book. Oh, she's got a head start.

14:01.549 --> 14:03.343
Here we go. Yeah, she's way ahead of me.

14:03.426 --> 14:04.552
Won that race.

14:04.636 --> 14:05.637
Days of thunder.

14:05.720 --> 14:07.388
Good night. Okay.

14:07.472 --> 14:09.724
He hasn't called or texted, and --

14:09.808 --> 14:11.267
and he wouldn't come home even

14:11.351 --> 14:13.394
when Izzy went to go get him.

14:13.478 --> 14:15.438
I think it's over, Carm. Like -- like for real.

14:15.522 --> 14:17.524
I think we're done. We're done.

14:17.607 --> 14:19.818
Why wasn't it you going to Gabe's house, Em?

14:19.900 --> 14:21.695
Because I wasn't the one who left!

14:21.778 --> 14:23.655
Have you tried calling him? Oh, my God.

14:23.738 --> 14:26.324
You sound like Izzy. Okay.

14:26.407 --> 14:29.577
Once more, I am not the one who had the emotional affair.

14:29.661 --> 14:31.830
I am not the one who -- Hey, I know I'm probably, uh,

14:31.912 --> 14:33.956
risking some serious peril wading in here,

14:34.040 --> 14:36.543
but, um, I just got to ask one question.

14:36.626 --> 14:40.380
What the fuck is wrong with you Trakarskys?

14:40.463 --> 14:41.631
Whoa. Okay. There's the peril.

14:41.715 --> 14:43.383
I see it. I'm out.

14:43.466 --> 14:46.594
Let me put it a little more delicately.

14:46.678 --> 14:48.680
What the fuck is wrong with you Trakarskys?

14:51.725 --> 14:53.476
Izzy and I had a firm agreement

14:53.560 --> 14:55.520
that Jack has to come crawling back on his hands

14:55.603 --> 14:58.439
and knees and grovel for forgiveness.

14:58.523 --> 15:00.400
Is that followed by the ritual castration,

15:00.483 --> 15:03.653
head shaving, and walk of shame?

15:03.737 --> 15:06.406
You might want to consider more reasonable

15:03.737 --> 15:06.406
terms for his surrender.

15:06.489 --> 15:08.366
You know, unless you're crafting

15:08.449 --> 15:09.450
a self-fulfilling prophecy.

15:09.534 --> 15:10.702
You know, to me, it sounds like

15:10.785 --> 15:12.537
the sex fairy is the only one

15:12.620 --> 15:13.996
really trying to keep this whole thing together.

15:14.080 --> 15:16.416
You know what, just back the fuck off, Dave, okay?

15:16.499 --> 15:17.667
Geez.

15:17.751 --> 15:19.627
I'm sorry.

15:19.711 --> 15:21.295
I didn't feel it coming. I just kind of heard it

15:21.379 --> 15:22.547
at the same time as you guys.

15:22.630 --> 15:24.465
Okay. Hey, hon?

15:24.549 --> 15:27.385
How 'bout you go upstairs now, huh

15:27.468 --> 15:28.678
What, are you sending me to my room?

15:28.762 --> 15:31.556
Why don't you call Weird Janis and her lover

15:31.639 --> 15:33.391
and find out the appropriate attire

15:33.474 --> 15:34.601
for this cleansing ceremony?

15:34.684 --> 15:35.769
Or hors d'oeuvres and eagle release.

15:35.852 --> 15:37.562
Whatever it is. Go.

15:37.645 --> 15:39.564
Okay, fine.

15:39.647 --> 15:41.733
Mom. Ugh!

15:41.816 --> 15:43.610
Oh, and if it has anything to do with my butt,

15:43.693 --> 15:44.778
it's a hard pass!

15:44.861 --> 15:47.405
I'll give you a hard pass!

15:47.488 --> 15:49.449
Um... What was I talking about?

15:49.532 --> 15:50.658
Okay, you do realize that you can't

15:50.742 --> 15:52.452
just say "Weird Janis and her lover"

15:52.535 --> 15:53.703
and then jump back in the conversation, right?

15:53.787 --> 15:55.580
Oh, it's some freaky chick at his agency.

15:55.663 --> 15:57.874
She's been trying to get us to go to her place

15:55.663 --> 15:57.874
in the woods for years.

15:57.957 --> 16:00.501
We're finally going tomorrow night, and I have

15:57.957 --> 16:00.501
this irrational fear

16:00.585 --> 16:02.420
we'll spend the rest of our lives as captives

16:02.503 --> 16:03.671
tending to our marijuana and radish gardens.

16:03.755 --> 16:06.674
So, what's the plan with Hal and Rita?

16:06.758 --> 16:08.760
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

16:08.843 --> 16:10.428
My parents tomorrow.

16:10.511 --> 16:12.555
Oh, my God.

16:12.639 --> 16:14.474
Oh, I think I've been suppressing that whole thing

16:14.557 --> 16:17.602
so my head doesn't spontaneously explode.

16:17.685 --> 16:21.439
Oh, fuck. But you do have a plan, right?

16:21.522 --> 16:23.274
Because they may be old, but they're gonna notice

16:23.357 --> 16:25.401
if there's a chick sleeping where Jack's supposed to be.

16:25.485 --> 16:26.986
I tried to go upstairs. I really did.

16:27.069 --> 16:28.655
But your situation is so...

16:28.738 --> 16:29.864
compelling and fucked up,

16:29.948 --> 16:31.908
that I physically couldn't stay away.

16:31.991 --> 16:34.452
You need to call your husband, Mrs. Trakarsky,

16:34.535 --> 16:36.621
and you need to tell him to get his ass back to your house

16:36.704 --> 16:38.998
so he can help you hoodwink your hyper-conservative parents.

16:39.081 --> 16:41.167
And you need to get this sex fairy

16:41.250 --> 16:43.628
the fuck out of Dodge for a few days.

16:43.711 --> 16:45.713
Okay, there is no version of this universe

16:45.797 --> 16:47.715
in which I call Jack and ask for his help.

16:47.799 --> 16:48.842
No fucking way. Okay, fine.

16:48.925 --> 16:50.092
Then Dave will go get him. Yeah.

16:50.176 --> 16:52.136
Then I will just have to go

16:52.219 --> 16:53.596
Don't make me get the fly swatter.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.807
Up. Honey...

16:55.890 --> 16:57.725
Why would you get...?

16:57.809 --> 16:59.769
You know what, I don't even want to know,

16:59.853 --> 17:02.522
'cause there is no room in here.

17:02.605 --> 17:03.815
All right.

17:03.898 --> 17:06.484
So...

17:06.567 --> 17:07.735
This is what we've got to work with.

17:07.819 --> 17:09.529
This is what we have to work with, yes.

17:09.612 --> 17:11.489
You guys are not helping. What's the venue?

17:11.572 --> 17:12.782
It's an Italian place she picked out.

17:12.866 --> 17:14.826
It's called, uh, "Ask For Luigi"?

17:14.909 --> 17:17.370
Ooh! No, that's definitely a date restaurant.

17:17.453 --> 17:19.163
Mm. Pretty much every chick that

17:19.246 --> 17:20.999
goes there comes out with a baby bump and a ring.

17:21.081 --> 17:22.333
That's not what's happening here.

17:22.416 --> 17:23.877
You do know anxiety restricts your blood flow?

17:23.960 --> 17:25.461
I'm sure Gabe here can hook you up with some

17:25.545 --> 17:27.839
of his extra-strength Viagra for chronic impotence.

17:27.922 --> 17:29.674
Oh, please, you waifish preemie.

17:29.757 --> 17:31.634
Everyone knows that the active ingredient in Viagra

17:31.718 --> 17:34.512
is my superhuman testosterone. It's magic.

17:34.595 --> 17:36.472
Did you actually just call your son a "waifish preemie"?

17:36.556 --> 17:38.683
Don't worry, I hear like 4% of what he says.

17:38.766 --> 17:41.853
Everything else just sounds like a dying water buffalo

17:38.766 --> 17:41.853
stuck in a tar pit.

17:41.936 --> 17:43.479
Please tell me that's the reject pile.

17:43.563 --> 17:44.689
Okay, you know what? That's it.

17:44.772 --> 17:46.524
I don't need this. -No, no, no.

17:46.607 --> 17:48.568
I may be a jock, but I knows my clothes.

17:48.651 --> 17:51.195
Okay, Gabriel, I need you to get me that thrift-store

17:48.651 --> 17:51.195
plaid sports jacket.

17:51.278 --> 17:53.698
And, Dad, I need you to get me the only cool tie you own,

17:53.781 --> 17:54.908
the one that you think is too skinny.

17:54.991 --> 17:57.451
Oh, and grab your tie clip. Go!

17:58.870 --> 18:00.663
Jack

18:00.747 --> 18:03.583
You know that rambly fast

18:03.666 --> 18:05.585
Yeah, it's pretty charming -- No, it's annoying as shit.

18:05.668 --> 18:07.503
Don't do it. I don't think that's

18:07.587 --> 18:09.714
the consensus. Both: Uh, yeah, it is.

18:09.797 --> 18:11.591
Yeah, I got to go with the girls on this one.

18:11.674 --> 18:13.718
You just talk sparingly, and you never break eye contact.

18:13.801 --> 18:15.720
Like dragon eyes. Zzzz.

18:15.803 --> 18:18.389
Uh, conversely, that sounds a bit rape-y.

18:18.472 --> 18:20.182
Worked on you.

18:21.893 --> 18:23.394
Uncle Jack, you okay?

18:23.477 --> 18:26.564
You know what, I don't even do

18:26.647 --> 18:28.608
the rambly thing anymore, okay?

18:28.691 --> 18:31.110
And, sorry, but I'm gonna wear whatever the fuck I want.

18:32.904 --> 18:35.865
Is that the jacket? Yeah.

18:35.949 --> 18:37.658
Lovely. Can I...

18:37.742 --> 18:38.826
Yeah.

18:54.968 --> 18:55.885
It's pretty great.

19:03.768 --> 19:05.686
Sketch much?

19:05.770 --> 19:07.063
You stalking me now?

19:08.689 --> 19:10.232
I'm grounded.

19:10.316 --> 19:11.943
If I have to watch one more reality show

19:10.316 --> 19:11.943
about drunk,

19:12.026 --> 19:13.861
40-something rich chicks, I'll will myself

19:13.945 --> 19:15.780
to have a deadly aneurysm.

19:15.863 --> 19:19.408
Aw, that's super sad. Now go the fuck away.

19:20.534 --> 19:22.870
So, why are you hiding out like a teenager to smoke weed?

19:22.954 --> 19:24.998
Well, I was enjoying the solitude.

19:25.081 --> 19:28.751
You're hiding. I'm taking some me time.

19:28.835 --> 19:30.795
In a shed?

19:30.878 --> 19:32.797
Fine.

19:32.880 --> 19:34.841
Emma has me on a torture cleanse.

19:34.924 --> 19:36.634
Says I smoke too much pot,

19:36.717 --> 19:38.970
which, given my thrice-a-day habit,

19:39.053 --> 19:41.973
is... an objective fact.

19:42.056 --> 19:43.808
But at this point,

19:43.891 --> 19:45.726
I don't think I can last another second in suburgatory

19:45.810 --> 19:46.978
without the help of marijuana.

19:47.061 --> 19:49.897
Are you happy now? We have a lot in common.

19:49.981 --> 19:52.650
No.

19:54.777 --> 19:56.320
So?

19:56.946 --> 19:58.656
Let's do this thing.

19:58.739 --> 19:59.949
Ava, I'm not getting you high.

20:00.033 --> 20:01.701
Well, if you don't share, I'll tell Emma

20:01.784 --> 20:03.786
that you were sneaking out back to...

20:06.747 --> 20:07.999
No. Stop.

20:08.082 --> 20:09.917
Don't do that anymore.

20:10.001 --> 20:12.211
I'm not Lori.

20:12.294 --> 20:13.671
Who are you talking to?

20:13.754 --> 20:15.882
Come on. Please.

20:17.925 --> 20:20.053
Just  I swear I won't tell.

20:31.939 --> 20:34.108
Just this once.

20:35.193 --> 20:36.944
Actually, you know what, this feels like one of those sober,

20:37.028 --> 20:38.738
second-thought opportunities

20:38.821 --> 20:41.782
that mark the end of cerebral adolescence, so I...

20:49.123 --> 20:51.250
Let me be excruciatingly clear.

20:51.333 --> 20:53.169
If you tell Lori about this, I will --

20:53.252 --> 20:54.795
You'll break my legs?

20:54.879 --> 20:57.173
Eat my face and puke in my exposed skull?

20:57.256 --> 20:59.926
Yep. Legit would do all those things, and worse.

21:11.604 --> 21:14.774
You know, this'll make you feel better.

21:14.857 --> 21:17.902
Apparently Jack got high with his nephew Gabriel,

21:17.985 --> 21:19.862
and he's just a freshman.

21:19.946 --> 21:21.072
How would you know that?

21:21.155 --> 21:23.783
Well, Gabriel told his sister Marina,

21:23.866 --> 21:25.201
who told Bailey Meyer, who told me,

21:25.284 --> 21:29.080
so I Facebooked Gabriel and he says it's true.

21:29.163 --> 21:30.998
They're, like, best buds now.

21:31.082 --> 21:32.959
Jack tells him everything.

21:33.042 --> 21:35.044
Really?

21:35.128 --> 21:37.004
Like what?

21:37.088 --> 21:38.923
Give me something.

21:39.006 --> 21:41.968
You mean something like...

21:42.051 --> 21:44.762
Jack has a big, romantic dinner

21:44.845 --> 21:46.973
with an ex

21:47.056 --> 21:49.100
Hey! Not the weed!

21:49.183 --> 21:51.060
Just helping you with your cleanse.

21:51.144 --> 21:52.186
Unh!

21:54.981 --> 21:57.024
Hey. Hi.

21:57.108 --> 21:59.110
What were you doing in the backyard?

21:59.193 --> 22:02.989
Um, I was taking a walk in the woods.

22:05.241 --> 22:07.160
Clear my head.

22:07.243 --> 22:08.869
To get high?

22:08.953 --> 22:10.913
Done with the cleanse already?

22:10.997 --> 22:12.748
I don't even have any.

22:12.832 --> 22:15.042
Well, good for you.

22:15.126 --> 22:16.543
Yep.

22:19.922 --> 22:21.966
Are you expecting someone?

22:22.049 --> 22:24.260
Not really.

22:32.685 --> 22:34.145
Oh, hey, Dave. Hey.

22:34.228 --> 22:35.813
Who would never show up at my house unannounced.

22:35.896 --> 22:38.024
Hm. Unless he was on a mission.

22:38.107 --> 22:39.984
Probably under orders from his wife.

22:40.067 --> 22:41.986
It's nothing like that. I was just in the neighborhood.

22:42.069 --> 22:44.947
Oh, yeah. It's gated. That's weird.

22:45.031 --> 22:47.200
Who are you seeing? The Rutherfords.

22:47.283 --> 22:50.828
Todd and... Muffy?

22:50.911 --> 22:52.038
Can I talk to Jack, please?

22:52.121 --> 22:53.831
No.

22:53.914 --> 22:55.582
Excuse me? Yeah, you heard me. No.

22:55.666 --> 22:57.960
Look, I know you're here to stop him

22:55.666 --> 22:57.960
from going on his date

22:58.044 --> 23:00.087
with an actual heterosexual woman, so no.

23:00.171 --> 23:02.089
Jack has a date already? Yeah.

23:02.173 --> 23:05.176
He's not calling it that, but everybody else

23:02.173 --> 23:05.176
knows what it is.

23:05.259 --> 23:06.886
Okay, so you're just actively trying

23:06.969 --> 23:08.470
to break up Jack and Emma's marriage?

23:08.554 --> 23:10.931
Yeah, and you're here to actively delay the inevitable.

23:11.015 --> 23:13.059
I just want to borrow him for a few days

23:13.142 --> 23:15.393
so they can play the happy couple for Emma's parents.

23:15.477 --> 23:17.146
You know, it seems to me that Emma's made her bed.

23:17.230 --> 23:19.523
Now she's got to sleep in it. With a young, hot woman.

23:19.606 --> 23:21.441
In front of her horrified parents.

23:21.525 --> 23:23.944
What is your stake in this? Why won't you just let me

23:21.525 --> 23:23.944
talk to my friend?

23:24.028 --> 23:26.030
'Cause I love my brother, okay? And she broke him.

23:26.113 --> 23:27.240
Dave? Hey.

23:27.323 --> 23:28.991
What's going on

23:29.075 --> 23:30.868
Emma's parents are coming to town.

23:30.951 --> 23:32.203
What Like, tomorrow.

23:32.286 --> 23:33.996
Oh. You know what

23:34.080 --> 23:35.248
you have to do, right?

23:35.331 --> 23:37.041
You're the one who said that she learned

23:37.124 --> 23:39.043
how to re-ride that bike. Is the bike a--

23:39.126 --> 23:41.045
It's a vagina.

23:41.128 --> 23:42.338
Vagina. All right? Listen to me.

23:42.420 --> 23:44.048
If you go on this date tonight

23:44.131 --> 23:46.133
instead of going to help Emma survive the next two days,

23:46.217 --> 23:49.136
when she knows that I came here to get you...

23:49.220 --> 23:51.222
There's no turning back.

23:51.305 --> 23:54.100
That's it. It's over.

24:06.320 --> 24:08.030
Oh, no, no, no. I didn't --

24:08.114 --> 24:09.865
On me.

24:11.033 --> 24:12.993
May I make a suggestion?

24:13.077 --> 24:16.163
Don't show up 10 minutes early like a complete dork?

24:16.247 --> 24:19.250
Knock that back and take a walk around the block.

24:19.333 --> 24:23.003
I'll reset the table. Let him wait a little.

24:26.132 --> 24:28.342
I like the way you think.

24:52.366 --> 24:55.077
I still believe in this.

24:55.161 --> 24:57.288
In the three of us.

24:57.371 --> 25:00.249
I know we've all made mistakes.

25:00.333 --> 25:02.084
A lot.

25:02.168 --> 25:05.963
A lot, a lot, over an insanely short period of time.

25:06.046 --> 25:08.048
But...

25:08.132 --> 25:10.217
We can fix this.

25:10.301 --> 25:13.012
We can put it back together.

25:13.095 --> 25:15.264
Doesn't seem like he wants to.

25:15.348 --> 25:17.975
What do you mean?

25:18.058 --> 25:20.311
Dave went to go get him and bring him back home.

25:20.394 --> 25:23.689
Save me from my parents' scorn.

25:25.149 --> 25:27.318
It's not looking good.

25:33.407 --> 25:35.575
What?

25:39.246 --> 25:41.415
