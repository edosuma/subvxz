WEBVTT

00:04.712 --> 00:05.811
- You got the money?
- No.

00:05.879 --> 00:07.970
Then there's your answer.
But, Maya, come on.

00:07.971 --> 00:10.049
You thought you could skip
school to come ask me this?

00:10.073 --> 00:12.941
I got first period study hall.
I'm not missing anything.

00:13.010 --> 00:14.376
My partner's real by-the-book.

00:14.444 --> 00:16.923
You better get your ass to class
before she give you a summons.

00:16.947 --> 00:17.947
Well, whatever.

00:20.117 --> 00:22.851
Who's that?
Will, my little brother.

00:22.920 --> 00:26.221
Wouldn't buy him tickets
to some concert.

00:26.290 --> 00:27.689
The basketball player?

00:27.758 --> 00:29.357
Smelled like sweaty
gym bags, didn't he?

00:29.426 --> 00:32.794
A little. Looks like -
a good kid, though.

00:32.863 --> 00:34.930
He is.
I mean, they all are.

00:34.998 --> 00:36.531
What is it, three
younger siblings?

00:36.600 --> 00:39.000
And my mom, who's
more work than all of 'em.

00:39.069 --> 00:41.670
That sounds
like a handful.

00:41.738 --> 00:44.973
It's worth it
for the most part.

00:45.042 --> 00:48.910
Do you feel any remorse
for your actions, Dr. Peterson?

00:48.979 --> 00:49.911
None.

00:49.980 --> 00:52.347
None? Your daughter's dead.

00:52.416 --> 00:54.249
And I was trying to save her.

00:54.318 --> 00:57.319
The drugs you gave her caused
her to go into cardiac arrest.

00:57.387 --> 00:59.754
She had an idiopathic
autoimmune disorder.

00:59.823 --> 01:02.290
She was degenerating
and in pain.

01:02.359 --> 01:03.592
Risk was necessary.

01:03.660 --> 01:06.595
And did her actual doctors agree
with your assessment?

01:06.663 --> 01:08.463
Her doctors had been
trying and failing

01:08.532 --> 01:10.131
to diagnose her for years.

01:10.200 --> 01:11.477
They didn't know what
they were doing.

01:11.501 --> 01:14.102
My client doesn't mean to say
her doctors were incapable.

01:14.171 --> 01:15.503
Yes, I do.

01:15.572 --> 01:16.805
Just that with
his extensive

01:16.874 --> 01:18.540
credentials and experience...

01:18.609 --> 01:20.308
What I mean to say is,

01:20.377 --> 01:24.346
if anyone had a shot at saving
Sarah, it was me.

01:24.414 --> 01:26.715
What was I supposed to do?
Sit by and watch?

01:26.783 --> 01:30.285
Your attempt to cure her
led directly to her death.

01:30.354 --> 01:33.521
I feel... no remorse

01:33.590 --> 01:36.258
because I know that I did
everything I could,

01:36.326 --> 01:44.466
down to Sarah's
last minute on this earth.

01:51.575 --> 01:54.009
Looks like Ty's back
on his corner.

01:54.077 --> 01:55.577
Man, this dude
has got to be

01:55.646 --> 01:56.846
the world's worst drug dealer.

02:03.387 --> 02:05.120
Hands where I can see 'em.

02:05.188 --> 02:06.888
Didn't we just arrest
you a month ago?

02:06.957 --> 02:08.323
And between you and me,

02:08.392 --> 02:10.068
you're my favorite
arresting officers ever.

02:10.092 --> 02:11.804
All right, you know the drill.
Do you got any needles

02:11.828 --> 02:13.273
or anything sharp
that's gonna hurt me?

02:13.297 --> 02:14.496
No. I wouldn't hurt a fly.

02:14.564 --> 02:18.566
Ooh... looks like
we're taking a ride.

02:18.635 --> 02:20.235
Okay, okay, wait! Wait!

02:20.304 --> 02:22.070
I got information for you.
Oh, really?

02:22.139 --> 02:23.905
You got a dirty cop
in your precinct.

02:23.974 --> 02:25.373
Dirty how?

02:25.442 --> 02:26.586
Five-O has been arresting
a lot of people

02:26.610 --> 02:27.842
in Elmore's Complex, right?

02:27.911 --> 02:29.244
- Uh-huh.
- Word is,

02:29.313 --> 02:30.712
some cop's been taking
more money

02:30.781 --> 02:32.247
than you've been bragging about.

02:32.316 --> 02:35.450
You're saying a cop is taking
money from crime scenes?

02:35.519 --> 02:37.686
- Exactly.
- Get the hell in the car.

02:57.975 --> 02:58.907
What we got?

02:58.976 --> 03:00.842
Danielle Zora, 22.

03:00.911 --> 03:01.955
Neighbor found
her like this.

03:01.979 --> 03:03.578
OD?
She had a baggie on her.

03:03.647 --> 03:04.647
Looks like cocaine.

03:04.681 --> 03:06.481
Was she with anyone last night?

03:06.550 --> 03:08.461
Not that we've learned, but
we got her roommate downstairs.

03:08.485 --> 03:09.485
Gavin Schlenger.

03:11.588 --> 03:12.687
That him?

03:12.756 --> 03:14.656
Yeah.

03:19.463 --> 03:20.395
Gavin?

03:20.464 --> 03:22.130
Detective Reagan.

03:22.199 --> 03:23.331
My partner Detective Baez.

03:23.400 --> 03:27.502
We understand you live here.
Yes.

03:27.571 --> 03:29.270
Any idea what Danielle
or who she was with?

03:29.339 --> 03:31.006
No, I-I don't have any idea.

03:31.074 --> 03:33.174
Was Danielle a
partier at all?

03:33.243 --> 03:34.642
I mean, she like
to do drugs?

03:34.711 --> 03:36.644
I mean, not more
than the next person,

03:36.713 --> 03:39.014
but it wasn't
uncommon in our crowd.

03:39.082 --> 03:40.315
What do you mean, your crowd?

03:40.384 --> 03:46.888
We're both artists. Um,
or she was an artist, anyways.

03:46.957 --> 03:49.090
she's, like, the last one
I expected to,

03:49.159 --> 03:50.492
to take it to that level.

04:02.439 --> 04:04.305
Two more, Jimmy?

04:07.911 --> 04:10.812
You know how I know
I'm still an optimist?

04:10.881 --> 04:11.980
No, how?

04:12.049 --> 04:15.550
When I get a message
that you're back in town,

04:15.619 --> 04:18.053
I don't go,
"This can't be good."

04:18.120 --> 04:19.154
Uh-huh.

04:19.221 --> 04:22.223
I go, "Oh, good.
Lenny's back."

04:25.395 --> 04:26.706
Well, thanks
for coming out, Frankie.

04:26.730 --> 04:28.730
- Sure.
- How's the family?

04:28.799 --> 04:31.866
All good. Jamie's
getting married.

04:31.935 --> 04:32.935
To a cop.

04:32.969 --> 04:34.169
Sweet. Congratulations.

04:34.984 --> 04:37.572
Okay. What?

04:37.641 --> 04:38.473
What?

04:38.497 --> 04:41.377
The Lenny I know, that's
an opening to bust balls.

04:41.378 --> 04:43.411
No, no, I mean it.
I'm-I'm happy for him.

04:43.480 --> 04:45.680
- Really.
- Thank you.

04:47.884 --> 04:48.817
Thanks, Jimmy.

04:48.885 --> 04:50.318
To family.

04:50.387 --> 04:51.953
To family. Okay.

04:58.562 --> 05:01.830
I was contacted
by a journalist who's, uh,

05:01.898 --> 05:03.932
doing a profile of
Joey "The Elephant" Nocerino

05:04.000 --> 05:05.233
for <i>The New Yorker.</i>

05:05.302 --> 05:08.937
Boy... there's a name I
haven't heard for a while.

05:09.005 --> 05:10.216
Well, that's because
the old dirtbag's

05:10.240 --> 05:12.073
been locked up
for 20 years.

05:12.142 --> 05:14.042
Forgotten but not gone.

05:14.111 --> 05:16.344
What's the story?

05:16.413 --> 05:17.790
Oh, it's another
<i>Goodfellas</i> knockoff

05:17.814 --> 05:19.247
starring Nocerino as Henry Hill.

05:19.316 --> 05:21.116
Says he remembers everything.

05:21.184 --> 05:24.018
"An Elephant Never Forgets,"
that's the title of the piece.

05:24.087 --> 05:25.720
Where's this going?

05:25.789 --> 05:29.791
He says I looked the other way
on some drug shipments

05:29.860 --> 05:32.594
when I was working narcotics
back in the '80s.

05:32.662 --> 05:35.063
Says I let some
of his rats run.

05:35.132 --> 05:38.099
The writer's got to get your
side of the story, right?

05:38.168 --> 05:39.501
Well...
What the hell?

05:39.569 --> 05:41.870
I gave my side
of the story.

05:41.938 --> 05:43.338
Well, then,
what's the problem?

05:45.108 --> 05:49.110
Problem is that what
Nocerino told him is true.

05:50.714 --> 05:52.647
Listen, I never
crossed the line

05:52.716 --> 05:54.249
when we were
partners, Frankie.

05:54.317 --> 05:55.717
I swear to God,
I never did that.

05:55.785 --> 05:56.951
But I just wanted to...

05:57.020 --> 06:00.054
give you a heads-up,
let you get ahead of it.

06:00.123 --> 06:02.357
Protect your house.

06:05.328 --> 06:08.596
And... say goodbye.

06:12.435 --> 06:14.102
I'm really sorry,
Frankie, I'm...

06:16.339 --> 06:20.842
I'm gonna
miss... this.

06:32.856 --> 06:36.856

06:56.595 --> 06:57.861
Well, how about this?

06:58.281 --> 07:01.193
Nocerino is just
a washed-up old gangster

07:01.194 --> 07:04.403
who's taking his last shot
at NYPD from behind bars?

07:04.404 --> 07:06.571
Also true, still not helpful.

07:06.640 --> 07:08.239
The statute of limitations
has expired.

07:08.308 --> 07:09.874
Lenny can't be charged.

07:09.943 --> 07:11.509
That's got to be
a good thing, right?

07:11.578 --> 07:14.446
He can be charged in the court
of public opinion, and so...

07:14.514 --> 07:15.714
And so will I.

07:17.050 --> 07:18.361
You want to start working
on your response?

07:18.385 --> 07:19.951
Yes, as soon
as that last little spark

07:19.987 --> 07:23.054
of optimism in me goes out.

07:23.123 --> 07:24.123
So, what's next?

07:24.191 --> 07:25.591
We find out
who's writing the story.

07:25.659 --> 07:26.791
Jeremy Breen.

07:27.894 --> 07:29.427
Okay.

07:29.496 --> 07:30.562
He's always been fair.

07:31.832 --> 07:33.631
Invite him up.

07:33.700 --> 07:36.868
No. It'll look like you're
trying to strong-arm him,

07:36.937 --> 07:38.147
and that'll become
part of the story.

07:38.171 --> 07:39.671
Hey, I just want to talk to him.

07:39.740 --> 07:40.672
Invite him up.

07:40.741 --> 07:42.140
You know...

07:42.209 --> 07:46.544
I always kind of knew something
might catch up with Lenny--

07:46.613 --> 07:49.314
an old collar where
he tuned somebody up,

07:49.383 --> 07:53.651
an angry husband
who had photographs...

07:53.720 --> 07:57.956
but... I never saw this coming.

07:58.025 --> 08:01.793
"Sometimes we're blindest
to those who are closest to us."

08:05.232 --> 08:06.164
Sorry.

08:06.233 --> 08:08.366
I want you to go over every file

08:08.435 --> 08:11.102
and report from
Lenny's narcotics teams.

08:11.171 --> 08:13.038
- Turn over every stone.
- Yes, boss.

08:13.106 --> 08:14.546
What if you don't like
what he finds?

08:16.910 --> 08:19.310
We'll put the stones back.

08:20.747 --> 08:23.748
We know this is a difficult
time, but we do need you

08:23.817 --> 08:25.483
to answer some questions.

08:25.552 --> 08:27.886
Anything to help you figure out
what happened to Danielle.

08:27.954 --> 08:29.721
Did Danielle have
a history of drug use?

08:29.790 --> 08:32.190
- Not to my knowledge.
- Do you know what she was doing

08:32.259 --> 08:33.658
last night, or who she was with?

08:33.727 --> 08:35.860
She said she was
going out celebrating

08:35.929 --> 08:37.595
with a friend of hers
from the gallery.

08:37.664 --> 08:39.197
Um, Caroline.

08:39.265 --> 08:40.765
And what was she
celebrating?

08:40.833 --> 08:42.567
She told me to
keep it a secret.

08:42.635 --> 08:45.170
With all due respect,
I think the time for secrets

08:45.238 --> 08:46.671
has probably passed.

08:46.740 --> 08:50.041
Mmm.

08:50.110 --> 08:52.077
Uh, she'd always been broke.

08:52.145 --> 08:54.179
She probably got
that gene from me.

08:54.247 --> 08:57.248
But she said she'd just
hit her big break,

08:57.317 --> 08:59.117
and that all of that
was about to change.

08:59.186 --> 09:01.086
Big break, like,
she sold some of her work?

09:01.154 --> 09:02.420
Yes.

09:02.489 --> 09:03.755
Why would that be a secret?

09:03.824 --> 09:06.124
Because the buyer was someone
very high profile.

09:06.193 --> 09:07.358
But you don't know who?

09:07.427 --> 09:09.060
No.

09:12.332 --> 09:14.265
Excuse me a second.

09:18.138 --> 09:20.872
Hey. Thanks for
coming down.

09:20.941 --> 09:23.408
You do realize I have other
cases besides yours, right?

09:23.477 --> 09:25.877
I do, and this will be the
last time I ask, I promise.

09:25.946 --> 09:26.878
No, it won't be.

09:26.947 --> 09:28.646
Probably not,
but what you got?

09:28.715 --> 09:32.083
There was cocaine in her system,
but there was also fentanyl.

09:32.152 --> 09:33.596
- Speedball?
- We've been seeing a lot of cocaine

09:33.620 --> 09:35.553
laced with this stuff,
but this was different.

09:35.622 --> 09:36.554
Different how?

09:36.623 --> 09:37.856
This wasn't
a normal speedball.

09:37.924 --> 09:41.326
There was enough fentanyl
in her to kill an entire block.

09:41.394 --> 09:44.963
That batch was meant to kill
whoever took it.

09:48.368 --> 09:50.502
I have Elaine Peterson.

09:50.570 --> 09:52.170
Great.

09:53.707 --> 09:55.373
Elaine, thank you
for coming in.

09:55.442 --> 09:57.242
As long as I don't
have to see him.

09:57.310 --> 10:00.845
- Good to see you.
- We're just gathering information

10:00.914 --> 10:02.647
so you won't
have to.

10:02.716 --> 10:05.817
Uh, you and Dr. Peterson
have been split

10:05.886 --> 10:07.652
for a while, is that right?

10:07.721 --> 10:11.089
You ever married someone only to
find out they were someone else?

10:11.158 --> 10:12.991
- Yes.
- Yes.

10:13.059 --> 10:16.427
Well, I found out my husband
was a narcissist.

10:16.496 --> 10:19.931
Who only cared about how
brilliant people thought he was.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.633
He was never there
for his family.

10:21.701 --> 10:23.968
He was there for Sarah
after she got sick.

10:24.037 --> 10:26.504
Yes, after she became
another project.

10:26.573 --> 10:30.875
Another emergency where he
could step in and save the day.

10:30.911 --> 10:37.715
Instead of accepting
what fate had given us,

10:37.784 --> 10:40.351
Dr. DiUbaldo didn't think
David's treatments

10:40.420 --> 10:41.886
were experiments.

10:41.955 --> 10:43.755
Dr. DiUbaldo didn't know
a damn thing

10:43.823 --> 10:44.903
about what David was doing.

10:44.958 --> 10:46.157
Are you saying

10:46.226 --> 10:49.394
that your husband didn't
disclose all of his treatments?

10:49.462 --> 10:50.795
Not by half.

10:50.864 --> 10:53.565
And I refused to stay
around and watch

10:53.633 --> 10:56.034
because I knew
how it was all gonna end.

10:56.102 --> 10:57.702
What wasn't he sharing?

10:57.771 --> 11:00.371
God only knows.
God and David.

11:00.440 --> 11:01.973
But what I know

11:02.042 --> 11:04.509
is that that disease

11:04.578 --> 11:06.844
didn't kill my little girl.

11:06.913 --> 11:09.180
David did.

11:09.249 --> 11:11.115
And I want you to prosecute him

11:11.184 --> 11:13.885
to the fullest extent
of the law.

11:21.861 --> 11:23.661
Hey, Sarge,
you got a minute?

11:23.730 --> 11:25.496
Officer Janko, yes.

11:25.565 --> 11:28.533
I was just wondering if you'd
given any more thought

11:28.602 --> 11:31.569
to that information that
my collar gave us yesterday.

11:31.638 --> 11:34.539
Twitter Ty. Yeah, I almost
recommended him for detective.

11:35.976 --> 11:38.142
Well, when I got him
talking in the car,

11:38.211 --> 11:41.179
he seemed to know a lot
about our operations

11:41.248 --> 11:42.180
in those projects.

11:42.249 --> 11:44.015
You don't believe him, do you?

11:44.084 --> 11:46.517
I think it's worth
following up.

11:49.923 --> 11:51.356
So you think
there could be

11:51.424 --> 11:57.462
a dirty cop in our precinct
and you and I haven't noticed?

11:57.530 --> 11:59.731
he's onto something?

11:59.799 --> 12:02.200
I think we should at least stop
by some of those apartments.

12:02.269 --> 12:04.469
<i>We</i> should?

12:04.537 --> 12:06.137
What if it gets back
to the squad

12:06.206 --> 12:07.726
that I'm personally
investigating them?

12:07.774 --> 12:09.641
Well, it's not great, but...

12:09.709 --> 12:11.609
It would violate
the trust that we have.

12:11.678 --> 12:13.511
A trust I've worked hard
to gain.

12:13.580 --> 12:14.612
You want them to trust

12:14.681 --> 12:15.992
that you'll always
look the other way?

12:16.016 --> 12:17.393
Is that the message
that you want to send?

12:17.417 --> 12:19.484
No, of course not.

12:20.787 --> 12:24.289
I made the notification to IAB.

12:24.357 --> 12:25.568
And they're gonna look into it?

12:25.592 --> 12:26.958
I don't know.

12:27.027 --> 12:29.427
Eddie, Ty's not really
a reliable source.

12:29.496 --> 12:31.462
So we're just gonna let it go?

12:31.531 --> 12:34.932
No, we're gonna leave this with
IAB, like we're supposed to.

12:49.015 --> 12:50.481
Hmm.

12:50.550 --> 12:52.617
Fancy.

12:52.686 --> 12:54.118
Can I help you
find anything?

12:54.187 --> 12:56.020
No, we're not in the market,

12:56.089 --> 12:57.822
but are you
Caroline Mason?

12:57.891 --> 12:59.023
Yes.

12:59.092 --> 13:00.736
We're told that you
were with Danielle Zora

13:00.760 --> 13:01.859
the night she died.

13:01.928 --> 13:04.062
So awful. Do you know
what happened?

13:04.130 --> 13:06.097
People are saying she overdosed.

13:06.166 --> 13:08.199
Sounds like you
don't believe the rumors.

13:08.268 --> 13:09.912
It wasn't that kind of night.
We went to a dive

13:09.936 --> 13:11.714
for a couple drinks
and then she went home to paint.

13:11.738 --> 13:15.006
Did her painting sessions
typically involve cocaine use?

13:15.075 --> 13:18.543
Sometimes she'd work all night
and into the next day.

13:18.611 --> 13:21.179
I guess I wouldn't be surprised.

13:21.247 --> 13:23.715
Any idea who she buys
her drugs from?

13:23.783 --> 13:25.650
With all her friends,
it could've been anyone,

13:25.719 --> 13:27.518
but it wasn't me.

13:27.587 --> 13:29.231
Her mother said the two
of you were celebrating

13:29.255 --> 13:30.855
some kind of
big art deal.

13:30.924 --> 13:32.023
Yes.

13:32.092 --> 13:33.524
What can you
tell us about it?

13:33.593 --> 13:35.793
Nothing, legally.

13:35.862 --> 13:38.563
Must be some pretty powerful
people involved.

13:38.631 --> 13:42.166
Yeah, and here I thought
we were powerful people, too.

13:43.436 --> 13:45.603
I could lose my job, Detectives.

13:45.672 --> 13:47.149
You could lose a hell of a lot
more than that,

13:47.173 --> 13:48.239
you don't help us.

13:49.776 --> 13:52.009
The buyer was Milton Vance.

13:53.980 --> 13:55.591
He's the most influential
collector in the city.

13:55.615 --> 13:57.882
After he buys your work,
everybody buys your work.

13:57.951 --> 13:59.462
What kind of money
are we talking here?

13:59.486 --> 14:00.985
Potentially hundreds
of thousands.

14:01.054 --> 14:04.455
And potentially even more than
that now that Danielle's dead.

14:04.524 --> 14:07.592
Now that she's dead,
it'll be a literal fortune.

14:21.382 --> 14:24.346
I have Jeremy Breen.

14:24.347 --> 14:26.747
Forewarned is forearmed.

14:26.816 --> 14:28.015
Oh, stop it.

14:29.018 --> 14:30.524
Good to see you, J.B.

14:30.525 --> 14:32.792
- Hey, Garrett.
- This is Commissioner Reagan.

14:32.861 --> 14:34.460
- Ah, Commissioner.
- Mr. Breen.

14:34.529 --> 14:36.095
Have a seat.

14:40.702 --> 14:42.535
Thanks for coming in.

14:42.604 --> 14:45.838
Happy to. So long as this
meeting is in good faith,

14:45.907 --> 14:47.740
like you promised.
- It is.

14:47.809 --> 14:50.176
Hopefully, good faith
on both sides.

14:50.245 --> 14:51.311
We just want

14:51.379 --> 14:54.514
to know how Lenny Ross
is framed in your piece.

14:54.582 --> 14:58.351
Well... he's in it.

14:58.420 --> 15:00.520
How about specifics?

15:00.588 --> 15:03.323
You can get those in the piece
when it comes out next week.

15:03.391 --> 15:04.691
Jeremy, help us out.

15:04.759 --> 15:07.327
We just want information,
we don't want to undermine you.

15:07.395 --> 15:11.264
I get that, but I reserve
the right to spring my own leaks

15:11.333 --> 15:12.532
if I choose to.

15:12.600 --> 15:15.234
<i>The New Yorker</i> takes
great pride in their

15:15.303 --> 15:17.036
fact-checking,
and rightly so.

15:17.105 --> 15:18.471
He said, baiting the trap.

15:18.540 --> 15:21.407
Look, all I want to know is,
you didn't just take the word

15:21.476 --> 15:23.242
of a convicted criminal

15:23.311 --> 15:25.445
about ancient
and hard-to-check history.

15:25.513 --> 15:27.413
I have it cold.

15:27.482 --> 15:28.915
How?

15:28.984 --> 15:31.250
Lenny Ross himself
confirmed all of it.

15:31.319 --> 15:34.854
And Lenny Ross
gave me most of it.

15:36.491 --> 15:37.651
What do you mean he gave you?

15:37.692 --> 15:39.859
Information he exchanged
with Nocerino.

15:39.928 --> 15:41.227
Tipping off raids,

15:41.296 --> 15:43.896
protecting transports.

15:43.965 --> 15:46.532
Things only the cop on that
narcotics squad could know.

15:46.601 --> 15:48.434
- He gave you all of that?
- Yes.

15:49.771 --> 15:51.282
Nocerino might be called
"The Elephant,"

15:51.306 --> 15:54.540
but his memory isn't as sharp
as it used to be.

15:54.609 --> 15:56.109
He seemed confused

15:56.177 --> 15:59.545
a number of times,
a number of instances

15:59.614 --> 16:02.115
who his cop on the inside was.

16:02.183 --> 16:03.983
I reached out to Lenny, and...

16:04.052 --> 16:07.720
Lenny opened up, he started
telling stories all on his own.

16:07.789 --> 16:09.155
He voluntarily confessed?

16:09.224 --> 16:12.358
He said he was amazed it took
so long for somebody to ask.

16:21.069 --> 16:23.503
Doesn't hurt to come
down for a visit.

16:23.571 --> 16:24.871
Get some fresh air.

16:24.939 --> 16:27.240
I just wish she would
return my calls.

16:27.308 --> 16:29.242
I wish she would
return mine, too.

16:31.846 --> 16:33.246
Doc?

16:33.314 --> 16:36.315
A.D.A. Reagan, I was just
about to return your call.

16:36.384 --> 16:38.451
- I'm sure.
- Detective ABETEMARCO,

16:38.520 --> 16:40.853
nice to see you again.

16:40.922 --> 16:42.488
I'm great, thanks.

16:42.557 --> 16:44.857
We're waiting for that
report on Sarah Peterson.

16:44.926 --> 16:48.061
Sorry, I'm a little behind.

16:48.129 --> 16:50.163
Your brother has me
running around the city.

16:50.231 --> 16:51.764
Make him come down here,

16:51.833 --> 16:53.266
like you make
the rest of us.

16:53.334 --> 16:55.535
Easier said than done.

16:55.603 --> 16:58.404
That's not the only reason why
it's taken me longer than usual.

16:58.473 --> 17:01.340
- I wanted to double-check my results.
- Which were?

17:01.409 --> 17:04.444
The original cause of death was
complication between medications

17:04.512 --> 17:05.778
resulting in a heart attack,

17:05.847 --> 17:07.446
but the more
in-depth screening

17:07.515 --> 17:10.616
you asked for found
traces of aconite.

17:10.685 --> 17:11.951
That a type of rock?

17:12.020 --> 17:14.153
Flower, actually, whose extract

17:14.222 --> 17:16.722
can cause respiratory failure
or cardiac arrest.

17:16.790 --> 17:18.657
Are you saying
someone poisoned her?

17:18.726 --> 17:20.827
Someone who knew
how to avoid any red flags

17:20.895 --> 17:23.214
in a toxicology screening.
- Why didn't you call me sooner?

17:23.263 --> 17:24.997
Like I said,
I was double-checking.

17:25.066 --> 17:26.699
Let's go, Anthony.

17:31.272 --> 17:32.972
Reagans.

17:40.582 --> 17:42.281
I don't get it.

17:42.350 --> 17:44.484
It's art, Reagan.
You're not supposed to get it.

17:44.552 --> 17:48.054
Well, I get,
like, that.

17:48.123 --> 17:50.790
- Do you?
- It's a doughnut.

17:50.859 --> 17:52.592
Yeah, but it's a doughnut
with sprinkles.

17:52.660 --> 17:53.759
Makes it better.

17:55.296 --> 17:57.163
- He's ready for you.
- Mm.

17:59.267 --> 18:01.434
Sorry to keep you waiting,
Detectives,

18:01.503 --> 18:03.569
it's been a busy day.

18:03.638 --> 18:06.606
No worries. We've just been
admiring the wallpaper.

18:06.674 --> 18:08.774
Yes, well, if we could
get on with it.

18:08.843 --> 18:12.478
You recently purchased work from
a young artist, Danielle Zora.

18:12.547 --> 18:14.247
She passed away a few days ago.

18:14.315 --> 18:17.016
It's absolutely tragic.
She was a singular talent.

18:17.085 --> 18:19.952
Now that she's dead, her work
will be in higher demand.

18:20.021 --> 18:22.121
Correct.

18:22.190 --> 18:25.091
And your holdings will
significantly increase in value.

18:25.160 --> 18:28.361
If I understand
what you're implying...

18:28.429 --> 18:30.530
that's absolutely absurd.

18:30.598 --> 18:32.598
- Is it?
- You think I'd kill an artist

18:32.667 --> 18:34.433
to increase the value
of their work?

18:34.502 --> 18:37.136
Uh, who else do you know that
purchased Danielle's work?

18:37.205 --> 18:39.405
Only those involved
in the transaction.

18:39.474 --> 18:42.141
Any of those people purchase
her art since then?

18:42.210 --> 18:43.809
Until the deal is made public,

18:43.878 --> 18:46.212
that would be a form
of insider trading.

18:46.281 --> 18:48.681
Well, somebody put you on
to her work in the first place.

18:48.750 --> 18:50.850
I mean, there's no way
you'd be slumming around

18:50.919 --> 18:52.418
a gallery like that.

18:53.521 --> 18:56.556
My friend's son
is an aspiring artist.

18:56.624 --> 18:58.291
I agreed to look
at his collection

18:58.359 --> 19:00.359
as a favor, but it
was a poor imitation

19:00.428 --> 19:03.829
of the real thing,
but he had some other works.

19:03.898 --> 19:04.931
Danielle's?

19:04.999 --> 19:07.166
Danielle's.

19:07.235 --> 19:09.502
As soon as I saw them, I knew.

19:09.571 --> 19:12.805
This friend of yours,
was their last name Schlenger?

19:12.874 --> 19:13.940
How did you know?

19:14.008 --> 19:16.709
Well, that's a whole
different art form.

19:16.778 --> 19:17.977
Let's go.

19:19.814 --> 19:22.949
I wish I could, but I can't,
okay? I'm sorry.

19:23.017 --> 19:25.885
Everything okay?

19:25.954 --> 19:27.753
Yup.

19:27.822 --> 19:30.923
Maya, you know you can
talk to me, right?

19:32.193 --> 19:34.994
It's Will, he wants to join
this basketball team.

19:35.063 --> 19:36.329
They travel
across the country.

19:36.397 --> 19:38.075
I mean, a lot of kids
get recruited from it.

19:38.099 --> 19:40.032
Problem is it costs
$4,000 to sign up,

19:40.101 --> 19:42.401
and it's $4,000
I don't have.

19:42.470 --> 19:45.638
Mm. Maybe we can organize
a racket at the precinct.

19:45.707 --> 19:46.784
I'm sure people
will want to help.

19:46.808 --> 19:48.407
But I don't want charity.

19:48.476 --> 19:51.310
Janko, just forget
I said anything, okay?

19:51.379 --> 19:52.578
Two-Nine Charlie.

19:52.647 --> 19:54.580
You have a 10-21
at the Elmore Complex.

19:54.649 --> 19:55.748
Be advised, neighbor states

19:55.817 --> 19:57.650
possible past burglary
at the location.

19:57.719 --> 19:58.884
Please check and advise.

19:58.953 --> 20:00.620
Two-Nine Charlie. On it.

20:17.472 --> 20:19.405
Police coming in.

20:31.619 --> 20:33.230
Doesn't look like the perp
took much, did they?

20:33.254 --> 20:36.022
Looks like a drug spot to me.

20:36.090 --> 20:38.024
I'm gonna check the back.

20:53.841 --> 20:55.007
You got something?

20:55.076 --> 20:56.876
You were right to follow
up with us, Sergeant.

20:58.613 --> 20:59.613
What is it?

21:02.684 --> 21:03.684
There.

21:07.488 --> 21:10.256
Marked bills.

21:10.325 --> 21:12.091
Right pocket.

21:23.568 --> 21:24.756
We can't move on her

21:24.757 --> 21:26.991
until she spends the money,
deposits at the bank,

21:27.060 --> 21:29.894
or takes it home, and we have to
show that she has no intentions

21:29.963 --> 21:31.762
of vouchering it
as evidence.

21:31.831 --> 21:33.264
What if she does turn it in?

21:33.333 --> 21:34.498
Then no harm, no foul.

21:34.567 --> 21:37.001
Mm-hmm. I can notify
her partner,

21:37.070 --> 21:38.336
tell her to keep eyes out.

21:38.404 --> 21:41.172
Absolutely not. Look, as I've
stated in the beginning,

21:41.241 --> 21:43.207
no one can know
about this, okay?

21:43.276 --> 21:45.042
We cannot risk having
someone tip her off.

21:45.111 --> 21:46.377
Her partner wouldn't.

21:46.446 --> 21:47.979
You know that for sure?

21:50.350 --> 21:52.617
Sergeant, the only reason
I'm looping you in on this

21:52.685 --> 21:53.896
is because of your
dogged persistence

21:53.920 --> 21:55.553
in getting us to
follow up on that tip.

21:55.622 --> 21:57.989
Now, your instincts were right,

21:58.057 --> 22:01.158
but don't make me regret this.

22:09.636 --> 22:10.735
Everything okay?

22:10.803 --> 22:12.069
Yeah.

22:12.138 --> 22:13.704
Who was that?

22:13.773 --> 22:15.906
Just a friend
from, from the neighborhood.

22:15.975 --> 22:18.409
A friend? Well, you look
like you've seen a ghost.

22:18.478 --> 22:20.155
Yeah, it's just been
a stressful day, I guess.

22:20.179 --> 22:21.290
Thought you were
working on the desk.

22:21.314 --> 22:23.247
Yeah, it's been
endless paperwork.

22:23.316 --> 22:25.583
I better get back to it.

22:35.161 --> 22:37.962
Your daughter was poisoned
with a substance called aconite

22:38.031 --> 22:39.997
that resulted
in cardiac arrest.

22:40.066 --> 22:41.677
Well, my client doesn't know
anything about that.

22:41.701 --> 22:43.200
Yes, I do.

22:44.504 --> 22:46.170
Because I administered it.

22:46.239 --> 22:49.307
And the manslaughter charge
just got bumped up to murder.

22:49.375 --> 22:52.410
I told you, I did everything
I could for Sarah,

22:52.478 --> 22:54.412
down to her last minute
on this earth.

22:54.480 --> 22:55.913
I stand by that.

22:55.982 --> 22:57.548
So you euthanized her?

22:58.651 --> 22:59.717
Yes.

22:59.786 --> 23:01.752
You realize
euthanasia is illegal

23:01.821 --> 23:03.020
in the state of New York?

23:03.089 --> 23:07.024
I did what was right,
not what was legal.

23:07.093 --> 23:08.793
Try to imagine how bad it was

23:08.861 --> 23:10.494
that I was driven
to that choice.

23:10.563 --> 23:12.496
I can't imagine giving up
on my daughter,

23:12.565 --> 23:14.632
no matter how hard it got.

23:14.701 --> 23:16.801
You think I gave up on her?

23:19.872 --> 23:23.908
I fought
with everything I could.

23:25.044 --> 23:28.979
I fought every single
day for Sarah.

23:31.184 --> 23:33.117
But it only got worse.

23:33.186 --> 23:35.686
It didn't give you
the right to kill her.

23:35.755 --> 23:36.854
It wasn't my right,

23:36.923 --> 23:38.823
it was hers.

23:40.727 --> 23:43.327
She begged me to end it.

23:43.396 --> 23:45.629
I've been in medicine
for many years.

23:45.698 --> 23:47.631
And through it all...

23:50.370 --> 23:53.938
I've never seen anyone

23:54.006 --> 23:58.442
suffer... like she did.

23:58.511 --> 24:03.347
And you can't know
what that's like.

24:03.416 --> 24:05.850
No, I can't.

24:05.918 --> 24:08.519
But maybe your wife can.

24:08.588 --> 24:11.822
Elaine is the one who
gave up, who ran away.

24:11.891 --> 24:13.824
She's still her mother.

24:13.893 --> 24:15.893
And she wants you prosecuted.

24:15.962 --> 24:17.561
For murder.

24:17.630 --> 24:19.163
Yes.

24:25.838 --> 24:28.939
I'm done fighting,
A.D.A. Reagan.

24:29.008 --> 24:31.308
I'll plead to whatever
you think is right.

24:31.377 --> 24:33.644
I already have to live with
the weight of my actions.

24:33.713 --> 24:37.782
Whatever sentence you give me

24:37.850 --> 24:41.919
will be nothing by comparison.

24:57.537 --> 24:59.203
Two things.

24:59.272 --> 25:00.638
Fire away.

25:00.706 --> 25:02.873
What are you doing in New York?

25:02.942 --> 25:04.241
That's a thing? I'm from here.

25:04.310 --> 25:06.577
Well, you hardly ever come north
from Florida anymore,

25:06.646 --> 25:08.045
especially in the winter.

25:08.114 --> 25:09.747
I got a cheap airfare,
what can I say?

25:09.816 --> 25:13.551
Or are you making
your last rounds

25:13.619 --> 25:15.820
before that story comes out?

25:15.888 --> 25:19.790
Saying your goodbyes to the
old friends and the joints

25:19.859 --> 25:21.926
so that when that
story comes out

25:21.994 --> 25:27.465
and you're gone, everybody
says, "How about that Lenny?

25:27.533 --> 25:30.434
"He managed to squeeze
in one last party,

25:30.503 --> 25:33.737
"one last poker game,
one last roll in the hay

25:33.806 --> 25:38.909
before we found out
he was a..." what?

25:40.646 --> 25:42.246
You give me
too much credit, Frankie.

25:42.315 --> 25:44.248
No, I think
it's just the opposite.

25:44.317 --> 25:47.751
I... I'm not sure
I give you enough credit.

25:47.820 --> 25:49.687
Uh, now I'm confused.

25:49.755 --> 25:52.690
You timed this so that everybody

25:52.758 --> 25:56.026
who means anything to you,
including me,

25:56.062 --> 25:58.596
would have to conclude
that everything in that story

25:58.664 --> 26:00.097
is all true,

26:00.166 --> 26:03.467
which would be why Lenny
wouldn't show his face anymore.

26:03.536 --> 26:08.873
I talked to Jeremy
Breen, and he said...

26:08.941 --> 26:13.644
Lenny, he said you
confessed voluntarily.

26:15.314 --> 26:17.481
Maybe I realized that my
conscience was bothering me

26:17.550 --> 26:18.816
more than I thought it was.

26:18.885 --> 26:19.984
That ain't it.

26:20.052 --> 26:21.785
Yeah, it is,
so let it go, Frank.

26:23.923 --> 26:26.123
What's this?

26:26.192 --> 26:28.392
The news, May 3, 1988.

26:28.461 --> 26:30.060
You made page four.

26:30.129 --> 26:33.697
You pulled a woman from a
burning building in Queens

26:33.766 --> 26:37.067
at the same time and
in a different borough

26:37.136 --> 26:40.204
from where you said you
were meeting with Nocerino.

26:40.273 --> 26:41.839
So I screwed up a date?
Big deal.

26:41.908 --> 26:43.507
We also found
about a half a dozen

26:43.576 --> 26:46.810
other similar discrepancies.

26:46.879 --> 26:49.146
Are you telling me you remember
the exact time and place,

26:49.215 --> 26:52.149
every move you made
30 years ago? Give me a break.

26:52.218 --> 26:54.818
If I was gonna go on the record
with it, I'd sure want to...

26:54.887 --> 26:57.421
Well, you're not, so let it be.

26:57.490 --> 26:59.089
Cut the crap.

26:59.158 --> 27:00.558
What the hell's going on here?

27:00.626 --> 27:03.060
You know,
only you could make a nice table

27:03.129 --> 27:04.328
in a nice restaurant

27:04.397 --> 27:06.397
feel like the hot seat
in a precinct house.

27:06.465 --> 27:10.334
Lenny, talk to me.

27:11.437 --> 27:14.905
I am talking to you, Frank.

27:14.974 --> 27:16.407
Let it be.

27:17.510 --> 27:20.311
Let it go.

27:20.379 --> 27:22.212
Please.

27:32.658 --> 27:35.292
Is it normal to be in here?

27:35.361 --> 27:37.795
Sorry, our luxury suite
was unavailable.

27:37.863 --> 27:39.508
Can we get you
a cup of coffee or something?

27:39.532 --> 27:40.798
Coffee would be great, thanks.

27:40.866 --> 27:42.399
Actually-- sorry,
do you have, um,

27:42.468 --> 27:43.867
do you have almond milk?

27:43.936 --> 27:46.103
I'll see what I can find.

27:48.040 --> 27:49.640
So why am I here, Detective?

27:49.709 --> 27:51.208
Is everything okay?

27:51.277 --> 27:54.178
Yeah, everything's fine. Look,
I appreciate you volunteering

27:54.246 --> 27:55.646
to come down.

27:55.715 --> 27:58.195
You seem like a nice guy, so I'm
gonna be very honest with you.

27:59.819 --> 28:03.287
We think that the drugs
Danielle had were poisoned.

28:03.356 --> 28:05.255
Poisoned,
like somebody murdered her?

28:05.324 --> 28:07.891
Yeah. Now, we also know that
you were involved in the sale

28:07.960 --> 28:11.595
of Danielle's artwork
to, uh, Milton Vance.

28:11.664 --> 28:12.941
I've known him
since I was a kid.

28:12.965 --> 28:14.643
He and my dad are on the board
of the Met together.

28:14.667 --> 28:18.268
So you should also know, then,
that whoever owns that artwork

28:18.337 --> 28:20.571
stands to make a,
a lot of money,

28:20.640 --> 28:22.272
especially now that she's dead.

28:22.341 --> 28:24.174
Well, I mean,
I-I hate to play this card,

28:24.243 --> 28:26.543
but, like, money's the one thing
I don't need.

28:26.612 --> 28:28.278
Oh, I... trust me, I know that.

28:28.347 --> 28:29.947
I was wondering

28:30.016 --> 28:32.883
if you could help us figure out
who might need the money.

28:32.952 --> 28:34.551
And who might have a motive.

28:37.223 --> 28:39.657
I mean, well,
come to think of it, actually,

28:39.725 --> 28:40.991
we have this friend Caroline.

28:41.060 --> 28:42.960
- Mm-hmm.
- She works at the gallery,

28:43.029 --> 28:44.795
she's an aspiring artist.

28:44.864 --> 28:47.197
She's really been struggling
to get by.

28:47.266 --> 28:49.633
We met Caroline. She, uh...

28:49.702 --> 28:51.502
ironically was partying
with Danielle

28:51.570 --> 28:54.138
the night she was poisoned.

28:54.206 --> 28:57.741
That's interesting. Okay, so
Caroline works at the gallery,

28:57.810 --> 29:00.577
watching all these
artists come and go,

29:00.646 --> 29:03.580
selling their works,
striking it rich.

29:04.884 --> 29:06.884
That's probably
very frustrating.

29:06.952 --> 29:08.686
Mm-hmm. It must be.

29:08.754 --> 29:10.098
Seeing all these other
struggling artists

29:10.122 --> 29:12.122
striking it rich
right in front of her face.

29:12.191 --> 29:14.191
Yeah, becoming celebrities
overnight

29:14.260 --> 29:15.526
'cause of someone like Vance.

29:15.594 --> 29:17.861
Vance, I mean, what the hell
does that guy know?

29:17.897 --> 29:19.263
Well, not as much
as people think.

29:19.365 --> 29:20.497
Exactly.

29:20.566 --> 29:21.732
Especially if he thinks

29:21.801 --> 29:23.701
that Danielle's art
is actually any good.

29:23.769 --> 29:25.302
Because between you
and me, I thought

29:25.371 --> 29:26.870
it was...

29:26.939 --> 29:28.872
Well, I mean, you know,

29:28.941 --> 29:31.375
she stole half of her ideas
from me, anyways.

29:31.444 --> 29:33.644
So you're saying she's not
only a second-rate artist,

29:33.713 --> 29:35.479
she was a fraud?

29:35.548 --> 29:36.992
Yeah, and Vance
couldn't even see that.

29:37.016 --> 29:38.682
So, Caroline,

29:38.751 --> 29:40.551
she was jealous,
she was passed up by Vance,

29:40.619 --> 29:41.919
she desperately needed
the money,

29:41.987 --> 29:45.189
so she goes out to
"party" with Danielle,

29:45.257 --> 29:46.724
and instead of
partying with her,

29:46.792 --> 29:49.193
she actually poisons her
drugs with, what was it?

29:49.261 --> 29:50.421
- Fentanyl.
- Fentanyl, right.

29:52.565 --> 29:54.665
Got to say, I think
it makes sense...

29:54.734 --> 29:56.266
Thank you so much.

29:56.335 --> 30:00.204
...that you are the one
who killed Danielle.

30:00.272 --> 30:02.339
Because I never
told you

30:02.408 --> 30:05.676
that it was fentanyl
that she was poisoned with.

30:05.745 --> 30:08.045
Well, fentanyl was a guess.

30:08.114 --> 30:12.182
Mm. That's interesting,
'cause I have a guess, too.

30:12.251 --> 30:15.185
That you are gonna be spending
the rest of your life in prison.

30:20.192 --> 30:22.259
Uh, I think I want
to have my lawyer here

30:22.328 --> 30:23.594
for the rest of this.

30:23.662 --> 30:26.396
Oh, I think
you're gonna need one.

30:36.483 --> 30:38.312
Maya Thomas.

30:38.313 --> 30:39.212
Here.

30:39.281 --> 30:40.814
Step forward, please.

30:45.654 --> 30:47.921
Present your firearm
for inspection.

30:52.961 --> 30:57.330
Officer Thomas, I'm Lieutenant
McDonnell of IAB.

30:57.399 --> 30:58.810
You're under arrest
for grand larceny,

30:58.834 --> 31:00.667
criminal possession

31:00.736 --> 31:03.503
of stolen property
for stealing cash.

31:03.572 --> 31:04.905
IAB executed a search warrant

31:04.973 --> 31:06.840
at Officer Thomas's apartment
this morning.

31:06.909 --> 31:09.676
There they found marked bills
from a recent crime scene

31:09.745 --> 31:11.678
along with a bank
deposit slip,

31:11.747 --> 31:14.548
indicating her intent
to keep it for personal use.

31:28.764 --> 31:31.698
Officer Thomas's actions
are a stain

31:31.767 --> 31:34.501
on the reputation of every
officer in this department.

31:34.570 --> 31:36.670
And like her, anyone
in this precinct

31:36.738 --> 31:39.773
caught violating the law will be
held to its highest standard.

31:39.841 --> 31:41.474
Without fail

31:41.543 --> 31:43.476
and without exception.

31:46.481 --> 31:49.416
Officer Tedesco, patrol
post six, 1400 meal.

31:53.989 --> 31:56.523
You were investigating
this whole time?

31:56.592 --> 31:58.959
IAB was.

31:59.027 --> 32:01.161
I followed up with them
after we had our conversation,

32:01.230 --> 32:02.662
got 'em to take a closer look.

32:02.731 --> 32:04.431
Then why didn't you tell me?

32:04.499 --> 32:06.366
'Cause I couldn't
tell anyone, Eddie.

32:06.435 --> 32:07.968
She was my partner.

32:12.040 --> 32:13.907
I couldn't risk
you tipping her off,

32:13.976 --> 32:16.042
even unintentionally.
You don't trust me?

32:16.111 --> 32:18.022
- Of course I trust you.
- Well, then I don't understand

32:18.046 --> 32:19.779
why you didn't
just say something.

32:19.848 --> 32:21.359
I have a responsibility
to the job, Eddie.

32:21.383 --> 32:22.482
We have talked about this.

32:22.551 --> 32:24.017
It's separation
of church and state.

32:24.086 --> 32:25.986
I just didn't think
that that meant lying to me.

32:27.322 --> 32:29.222
I'm sorry, Eddie.

32:29.291 --> 32:30.571
I wish there'd been another way.

32:30.626 --> 32:32.359
She was having money problems.

32:32.427 --> 32:34.194
If I had offered
to help her sooner...

32:34.263 --> 32:35.829
That's on her, Eddie, not you.

32:35.897 --> 32:38.832
If I hadn't pushed you
to follow up on that tip...

32:38.900 --> 32:40.834
There'd still be a dirty cop
in our precinct.

32:40.902 --> 32:42.168
You did the right thing.

32:45.340 --> 32:48.308
Has A.D.A. Reagan decided
what she's charging?

32:48.377 --> 32:50.877
I never know what goes on in
that pretty head of hers,

32:50.946 --> 32:53.146
and I prefer
to keep it that way.

32:53.215 --> 32:54.914
What's she doing here?

33:01.590 --> 33:02.622
Elaine.

33:02.691 --> 33:04.624
David.

33:07.095 --> 33:09.863
I thought it would be
beneficial to everyone

33:09.931 --> 33:12.032
if we discuss
the next step together.

33:12.100 --> 33:13.733
You mean
if we discussed

33:13.802 --> 33:15.635
locking me up for murder.

33:15.704 --> 33:16.903
It's what you deserve.

33:18.173 --> 33:20.774
I know you're both
in a lot of pain.

33:20.842 --> 33:22.409
But maybe

33:22.477 --> 33:24.077
you're a little
more angry

33:24.146 --> 33:26.546
at the world
than you are at each other.

33:26.615 --> 33:28.815
He killed our daughter.

33:28.884 --> 33:31.551
Yes... I did.

33:33.455 --> 33:36.723
I tried everything
I could think of, Elaine.

33:36.792 --> 33:38.825
Things were only getting worse.

33:38.894 --> 33:41.061
They were getting worse
because of you!

33:41.129 --> 33:43.930
That god
you started praying to?

33:43.999 --> 33:46.633
He believes in mercy,
doesn't he?

33:46.702 --> 33:48.568
Murder isn't mercy.

33:51.773 --> 33:56.710
She... begged me, Elaine.

34:00.282 --> 34:02.549
It doesn't matter.

34:02.617 --> 34:04.751
I can't forgive you for this.

34:04.820 --> 34:07.387
I'd never ask you to.

34:08.690 --> 34:13.960
It was the most horrible moment
of my life.

34:14.029 --> 34:16.329
I'm glad you didn't
have to share it.

34:16.398 --> 34:17.931
I think it might
be important

34:17.998 --> 34:22.768
to ask:
what would your daughter want?

34:22.838 --> 34:24.704
Would she want

34:24.773 --> 34:28.808
her father to be locked up
for the rest of his life?

34:33.581 --> 34:36.014
No.

34:36.083 --> 34:38.016
No, she wouldn't.

34:40.355 --> 34:42.989
She was too kind a soul.

34:46.527 --> 34:48.928
I can't forgive you.

34:51.132 --> 34:54.067
But God does believe in mercy.

35:09.384 --> 35:11.651
I will be charging you
with manslaughter

35:11.720 --> 35:15.321
and recommending probation
to the judge.

35:15.390 --> 35:17.490
With no jail time.

35:58.467 --> 35:59.899
The hell is this?

35:59.968 --> 36:01.301
Coffee?

36:01.369 --> 36:02.902
No, I don't want coffee.

36:02.971 --> 36:06.473
And, yeah, I know what block
we're on, and, yeah, I knew him.

36:06.541 --> 36:10.810
I know you did.
He was on your narcotics squad.

36:10.879 --> 36:15.482
He also did a little business
on the side for Nocerino.

36:15.550 --> 36:18.084
Well, you know so damn much,
what do you need me here for?

36:18.153 --> 36:19.385
To tell me why.

36:19.454 --> 36:21.421
No. It's better
you're in the dark.

36:21.490 --> 36:23.089
Doesn't work that way.

36:23.158 --> 36:24.524
Not your call.

36:25.627 --> 36:28.061
Who was he to you, Lenny?

36:28.129 --> 36:30.063
Don't do this.
I have to.

36:30.131 --> 36:31.731
Frank, look at me.

36:31.800 --> 36:34.734
There is nothing,
nothing you can do about this.

36:34.803 --> 36:37.270
For once in your life, please
just take some of my advice.

36:37.339 --> 36:40.974
Nah. You know me.
I suck at that.

36:42.077 --> 36:44.043
And I know you.

36:44.112 --> 36:46.746
You were a lot of things to
cover the kids' ears about,

36:46.815 --> 36:50.350
but you were not a dirty cop.

36:50.418 --> 36:53.286
You know what your problem is?

36:54.322 --> 36:56.256
Hmm?

36:56.324 --> 36:58.992
You want to believe
in the good in your people.

36:59.060 --> 37:00.994
That's your blind spot, Frank.

37:01.062 --> 37:03.496
Well, I wasn't blind
about this, was I?

37:04.599 --> 37:06.432
We were friends.

37:07.536 --> 37:10.537
And I was close
to the family as well.

37:10.605 --> 37:13.139
It was tough when he died,
especially for Susan, his widow.

37:13.208 --> 37:15.275
She was left with two boys
to raise.

37:15.343 --> 37:18.778
So I tried to be around,
help out with them,

37:18.847 --> 37:20.480
comfort her.

37:20.549 --> 37:21.614
One thing led to another,

37:21.683 --> 37:23.349
and she and I started
to have, you know.

37:24.953 --> 37:26.953
I know it was wrong--
I knew it back then.

37:27.022 --> 37:29.822
That's, that's why I ended it.

37:29.891 --> 37:33.059
And that's when
you moved to Florida.

37:33.128 --> 37:34.394
Yeah.

37:34.462 --> 37:36.829
And then, when this...

37:36.898 --> 37:39.198
reporter came
to me, I,

37:39.267 --> 37:42.702
I just couldn't bring myself
to rat out Mike.

37:42.771 --> 37:47.006
Not to protect his memory,
but, but to protect Susan.

37:47.075 --> 37:49.976
You cannot take the fall
for this, Lenny.

37:50.045 --> 37:52.845
Frank, there's nothing
you can do about this.

37:54.249 --> 37:56.182
I mean, okay,

37:56.251 --> 37:58.351
you could hold
a second ceremony,

37:58.420 --> 37:59.686
take down that sign up there.

37:59.754 --> 38:02.689
Tell Susan and the boys
that their fallen hero

38:02.757 --> 38:04.924
was just another dirty cop.
You could do that.

38:04.993 --> 38:07.026
It would be the truth.

38:07.095 --> 38:08.761
Yeah, but you still won't do it.

38:08.830 --> 38:11.397
Frank, there's nothing
you can do.

38:11.466 --> 38:15.234
And I'm sorry,
I know you suck at that, too.

38:15.303 --> 38:17.370
Press is gonna hound you,
you know that.

38:18.607 --> 38:22.308
And you will probably
lose your pension.

38:22.377 --> 38:24.477
I know.

38:28.883 --> 38:32.785
And you can't
come around anymore.

38:34.856 --> 38:36.556
I know how it'll be, Frank.

38:43.498 --> 38:45.431
I'll see you, Frankie.

38:51.306 --> 38:52.705
Aw, come on.

38:58.279 --> 39:00.246
Not if I see you first.

39:17.499 --> 39:18.698
I know we just said grace,

39:18.767 --> 39:20.633
but I just want to say
how blessed I feel

39:20.702 --> 39:22.268
to be part of this family.

39:23.672 --> 39:24.837
You feeling okay?

39:24.906 --> 39:25.805
Yeah, will you check
her forehead?

39:25.874 --> 39:27.707
Do it and I fork you.

39:27.776 --> 39:28.941
Let's keep it civil.

39:29.010 --> 39:30.510
Hey, I own that.

39:31.680 --> 39:33.913
Well, we own it.

39:33.982 --> 39:36.449
And you're all warm
and fuzzy, why?

39:36.518 --> 39:39.452
I can't say I'm grateful
just because?

39:39.521 --> 39:41.120
No.

39:41.189 --> 39:42.288
Apparently not.

39:43.391 --> 39:45.224
Fine.

39:45.293 --> 39:49.028
I had a case this week where
the two parents were torn apart

39:49.097 --> 39:51.164
because of their
daughter's illness.

39:51.232 --> 39:52.799
And it just
made me realize

39:52.867 --> 39:54.701
how strong
this family stayed

39:54.769 --> 39:58.671
in spite of all the loss
we endured.

40:00.341 --> 40:01.808
Maybe she does have a heart.

40:01.876 --> 40:03.242
That'd be a stretch.

40:03.311 --> 40:04.944
Will you whack them
for me, please?

40:06.247 --> 40:07.080
Well, thanks for that, Mom.

40:07.148 --> 40:09.315
I feel the same way.

40:09.384 --> 40:10.850
Yeah, and I think
it's a good idea

40:10.919 --> 40:13.352
to say it out loud
once in a while,

40:13.421 --> 40:16.322
kind of like a version of
"stop and smell the roses."

40:16.391 --> 40:17.535
Except our version would be

40:17.559 --> 40:20.860
"stop and count
the survivors."

40:22.130 --> 40:23.963
You take what you can get.

40:24.032 --> 40:27.133
Well, we had
our own loss this week.

40:27.202 --> 40:30.703
Uh, turns out that my partner
was pocketing money

40:30.772 --> 40:32.171
from crime scenes.

40:32.240 --> 40:33.139
No.

40:33.208 --> 40:34.807
IAB arrested her on Friday.

40:34.876 --> 40:37.343
At roll call, from what I heard.
Yes.

40:37.412 --> 40:39.278
In front of all
of her fellow officers?

40:39.347 --> 40:40.246
- Mm-hmm.
- Wow.

40:40.315 --> 40:41.147
Yes.

40:41.216 --> 40:42.415
That's pretty harsh.

40:42.484 --> 40:44.550
I call it necessary roughness.

40:44.619 --> 40:46.552
Sends a message:
one strike, you're out.

40:46.621 --> 40:47.920
Your uncle did

40:47.989 --> 40:49.522
exactly the right thing.

40:49.591 --> 40:50.757
You have any idea

40:50.825 --> 40:52.191
what she was up to?

40:52.260 --> 40:53.826
You mean, was I protecting her?

40:53.895 --> 40:55.094
No, that's not what I meant.

40:55.163 --> 40:57.041
I think I know you
a little bit better than that.

40:57.065 --> 40:58.831
I had no idea.

40:58.900 --> 41:02.935
A-And, I-I mean, I wasn't
looking for it either,

41:03.004 --> 41:05.104
so I probably missed
some of the red flags.

41:05.173 --> 41:08.007
And maybe I could have done
something to...

41:08.076 --> 41:09.776
All right,
Maya's not on you, Eddie.

41:11.546 --> 41:13.146
It's not like you
ratted her out.

41:13.214 --> 41:14.781
Well, when you know
a cop's dirty,

41:14.849 --> 41:16.749
it's technically not called
ratting them out

41:16.818 --> 41:18.084
if you speak up.

41:18.153 --> 41:21.387
It's called protecting
the other 35,000 cops.

41:21.456 --> 41:22.388
Just don't rat

41:22.457 --> 41:23.723
on another Reagan.

41:23.792 --> 41:25.091
That's the only rule.

41:25.126 --> 41:26.626
Even to another Reagan?

41:26.661 --> 41:29.028
Well, that's not ratting, that's
just collective bargaining.

41:29.097 --> 41:30.396
No, that's payback.

41:30.465 --> 41:31.731
Testifying.

41:32.634 --> 41:33.634
Tough love.

41:33.701 --> 41:35.234
Tradition.
