00:05.538 --> 00:09.240
<i>"as I sit down to write this, I'm thinking
about you and me.</i>

00:09.308 --> 00:10.809
<i>"there's one time in particular</i>

00:10.876 --> 00:13.044
<i>"that I can't get out of my head.</i>

00:13.112 --> 00:14.846
<i>"I took our housekeeper's matches</i>

00:14.914 --> 00:17.315
<i>"and I set the leaves in the
backyard on fire.</i>

00:17.383 --> 00:19.617
<i>"then I tried to blame her.</i>

00:19.685 --> 00:22.687
<i>"you knew better, of course.</i>

00:22.755 --> 00:24.823
<i>"and you used it as an opportunity to teach
me</i>

00:24.890 --> 00:28.326
<i>"the difference between lying
and being a liar.</i>

00:28.394 --> 00:32.664

say anything to you,</i>

00:32.732 --> 00:34.332

had to deal with,</i>

00:34.400 --> 00:38.570
<i>"your love for me would
never go away.</i>

00:38.637 --> 00:42.040
<i>"I guess that's why I'm writing this to
you.</i>

00:42.108 --> 00:45.310
<i>"I know you and mom are
worried about me.</i>

00:45.377 --> 00:47.812
<i>"I know you think I'm not handling college
well,</i>

00:47.880 --> 00:49.647
<i>"that I'm adrift.</i>

00:49.715 --> 00:52.784
<i>"and I guess you're both right.</i>

00:52.852 --> 00:55.854
<i>But it's a little more
complicated than that."</i>

01:04.663 --> 01:06.564
Mmm.

01:06.632 --> 01:07.766
You need anything?

01:07.833 --> 01:10.335
Your mom wasn't sure that you would have

01:10.402 --> 01:12.437
Enough money left after buying your books.

01:12.505 --> 01:15.373
No, I'm fine, dad.

01:15.441 --> 01:18.009
<i>"I'm so glad you came all the
way out to see me.</i>

01:18.077 --> 01:19.544
<i>"I know you're busy.</i>

01:19.612 --> 01:24.182
<i>"and I wanted to talk to you,
really talk to you,</i>

01:24.250 --> 01:26.217
<i>"but I just couldn't.</i>

01:27.920 --> 01:30.922
<i>"that's my fault, dad, not yours.</i>

01:32.925 --> 01:35.794
<i>"so I'm going to say everything now.</i>

01:35.861 --> 01:37.462
<i>"I know that's not fair.</i>

01:37.530 --> 01:40.265
<i>"but please don't be too mad at me.</i>

01:40.332 --> 01:43.735
<i>"this is something I've been thinking about
doing</i>

01:43.803 --> 01:46.171
<i>"for a while now.</i>

01:46.238 --> 01:47.505
<i>"and I want you to know</i>

01:47.573 --> 01:50.575
<i>That it would have happened no matter
what."</i>

01:53.646 --> 01:55.280
<i>"I've been so confused.</i>

01:55.347 --> 01:56.948
<i>And this thing, it's..."</i>

01:57.016 --> 01:58.483
Arianna?

01:58.551 --> 02:01.553
<i>"...Like a lighthouse in the middle of all
that.</i>

02:01.620 --> 02:03.288
<i>"it's so easy to steer toward,</i>

02:03.355 --> 02:05.857
<i>"that I feel like it's where I have to
go.</i>

02:05.925 --> 02:09.494
<i>"the first thing I want to say is that I'm
sorry.</i>

02:09.562 --> 02:11.563
<i>"I hope that, since this
is the last time</i>

02:11.630 --> 02:14.299
<i>"I'm going to talk to you,
I can give you what you need</i>

02:14.366 --> 02:17.869
<i>"to come to terms with
what I've done.</i>

02:17.937 --> 02:21.039
<i>"you're my dear dad.</i>

02:21.106 --> 02:23.007
<i>I can say anything to you,
right, dad?"</i>

02:23.075 --> 02:24.075
Hello?

02:27.780 --> 02:29.714
Ari!

02:35.154 --> 02:36.554
Arianna?

03:42.130 --> 03:44.031
Departure time is t-minus five minutes.

03:44.098 --> 03:45.499
If you're not on the train,

03:45.566 --> 03:47.567
You're going to be left at the station.

03:47.635 --> 03:48.568
Can you help?

03:48.636 --> 03:49.970
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Thanks.

03:50.038 --> 03:51.338
Marie, honey, you got five minutes.

03:51.406 --> 03:53.040
I just want to finish this chapter.

03:53.107 --> 03:55.709
Well, you can finish in the car.

03:55.777 --> 03:57.744
Hey, is this a library book?

03:57.812 --> 03:58.879
Where'd you get this?

03:58.946 --> 04:00.447
We haven't been to the library in ages.

04:00.515 --> 04:01.648
It was in my closet.

04:01.716 --> 04:03.417
Well, when was it due?

04:03.484 --> 04:04.985
I don't know. I didn't take it out.

04:05.053 --> 04:06.553
Well, who did?

04:07.121 --> 04:08.621
Who do you think?

04:08.689 --> 04:10.857
Well, somebody must have cleaned the room

04:10.925 --> 04:13.326
And just stuck it in the closet.

04:13.394 --> 04:14.727
Somebody?

04:14.795 --> 04:15.929
Bridge, that isn't your book.

04:15.996 --> 04:17.497
It belongs to the library.

04:17.565 --> 04:19.565
Yeah, well, I guess I
forgot they were in there.

04:19.632 --> 04:20.700
"they?"

04:20.767 --> 04:22.235
How many have you got in there?

04:22.303 --> 04:23.469
I don't know.

04:23.537 --> 04:25.605
I mean, they let you check
out seven at a time.

04:25.673 --> 04:29.642
Bridgette, you have seven
overdue books in your closet?

04:29.710 --> 04:31.644
You're not supposed to
take the library books,

04:31.712 --> 04:33.479
You're supposed to bring them back.

04:34.047 --> 04:35.147
Well, it's too late now.

04:35.215 --> 04:36.716
I mean, if I brought them back,

04:36.783 --> 04:39.118
Then they would send me
to jail or something.

04:39.186 --> 04:40.586
They're not going to send you to jail.

04:40.654 --> 04:41.987
They're going to charge you a fine.

04:42.055 --> 04:44.023
I'm guessing it's going to be big.

04:44.091 --> 04:46.192
My hunch is your allowance
is going straight to

04:46.259 --> 04:47.960
The public library for the next few months.

04:48.028 --> 04:49.862
But library books are supposed to be free.

04:49.930 --> 04:52.098
They are free, as long
as you play by the rules.

04:52.165 --> 04:54.100
After school today,
I want you to walk over there

04:54.167 --> 04:55.101
And return those books.

04:55.168 --> 04:56.369
Fine.

04:58.372 --> 04:59.939
I was reading that!

05:00.006 --> 05:01.307
Well, too bad.

05:01.375 --> 05:02.842
Go check it out at the library.

05:05.746 --> 05:06.679
Hello.

05:06.747 --> 05:07.713
Morning.

05:07.781 --> 05:09.482
Um, sorry to bother you so early.

05:09.549 --> 05:10.616
Oh, no, no, no.

05:10.684 --> 05:12.084
It's no bother, mr. District attorney.

05:12.152 --> 05:13.953
I was wondering if I could ask a favor.

05:14.020 --> 05:16.622
Wondering if there was any way
I could get you to drop by

05:16.690 --> 05:18.524
My house on your way to work this morning,

05:18.592 --> 05:19.525
Say around 9:00?

05:19.593 --> 05:21.394
Course. Is everything all right?

05:21.461 --> 05:24.029
Nothing that can't hold until 9:00.

05:42.249 --> 05:44.083
Nice hair.

05:44.151 --> 05:45.418
Nice glasses.

06:00.967 --> 06:04.236
As you both know, our daughter
arianna took her own life

06:04.304 --> 06:06.305
During her sophomore year of college.

06:06.373 --> 06:09.275
Today is the anniversary
of the day she died,

06:09.342 --> 06:10.643
The day I found her.

06:16.917 --> 06:19.852
Losing a child...

06:19.920 --> 06:22.421
Is always a nightmare for any parent.

06:22.489 --> 06:27.226
For us, I think it's been
especially difficult.

06:27.294 --> 06:29.261
Arianna didn't leave a note.

06:29.329 --> 06:32.498
She never told us why.

06:32.566 --> 06:35.167
Nothing at all?

06:35.235 --> 06:37.403
She never communicated
with either one of you?

06:39.005 --> 06:41.407
Lily went out to get the newspaper,

06:41.475 --> 06:44.743
And saw that the flag was up on the mailbox.

06:44.811 --> 06:46.645
And when she looked inside,

06:46.713 --> 06:48.848
She found this.

06:57.290 --> 06:58.457
Oh, no.

06:58.525 --> 07:02.094
This is terrible.

07:02.162 --> 07:04.330
I'm so sorry.

07:04.397 --> 07:06.665
I certainly made my share
of enemies over the years.

07:06.733 --> 07:09.768
Put plenty of bad people in prison,

07:09.836 --> 07:12.271
Even received death threats,

07:12.339 --> 07:13.606
But never anything like this.

07:13.673 --> 07:16.442
Never anything involving my family.

07:18.478 --> 07:21.847
Would you please excuse me?

07:25.919 --> 07:27.953
You know, this is going to sound crazy.

07:28.021 --> 07:31.056
I think I saw the man who did this.

07:32.592 --> 07:34.593
What are you talking about?

07:34.661 --> 07:36.996
I saw a man putting
something in your mailbox.

07:37.063 --> 07:39.899
I mean, I didn't really see it,
and he wasn't really there,

07:39.966 --> 07:41.800
But I didn't realize that at the time.

07:41.868 --> 07:44.703
I actually got a pretty good look at him.

07:44.771 --> 07:47.573
He was young, maybe 30.

07:47.641 --> 07:51.243
Caucasian, tall, thin.

07:51.311 --> 07:54.380
And he was wearing these glasses.

07:54.447 --> 07:56.715
Kind of... Black, vintage frames.

07:56.783 --> 07:59.184
Ring any bells?

07:59.252 --> 08:01.754
No, I don't think so.

08:01.821 --> 08:03.188
Okay, I'll tell you what--

08:03.256 --> 08:04.523
I'm going to canvass the neighborhood,

08:04.591 --> 08:06.125
See if anyone else saw this guy.

08:06.192 --> 08:08.127
I'm also going to have
someone at the station

08:08.194 --> 08:09.995
Put together a file of all your cases.

08:10.063 --> 08:12.665
A mug-book of everyone you've tried.

08:12.732 --> 08:15.167
If the guy who left this
really is someone you put away,

08:15.235 --> 08:18.504
Then, well, hopefully,
allison will recognize him.

08:20.540 --> 08:22.908
Young lady, these books are very late.

08:22.976 --> 08:25.077
You've had them for more than a year now.

08:25.145 --> 08:27.012
I know.

08:27.080 --> 08:30.049
I, uh, guess I just kind
of lost track of them.

08:30.116 --> 08:31.483
I'm sorry.

08:31.551 --> 08:33.318
But they were really good.

08:33.385 --> 08:34.919
Glad you thought so.

08:34.988 --> 08:38.123
Now maybe some other
children can enjoy them, too.

08:38.191 --> 08:40.993
I'm afraid we've already
forwarded these to collections.

08:41.061 --> 08:43.861
You owe the retail cost of the books.

08:43.929 --> 08:47.866
Which comes out to $92.18.

08:47.934 --> 08:49.735
Ninety-two dollars?!

08:49.803 --> 08:50.836
I'm just a kid!

08:50.904 --> 08:52.504
Where am I supposed to get $92?

08:52.572 --> 08:55.507
Uh, you're not going to
call the police, are you?

08:55.575 --> 08:57.009
Am I going to get arrested?

08:57.077 --> 08:59.111
What about asking your parents?

08:59.179 --> 09:01.880
No. I don't want to do that.

09:01.948 --> 09:03.949
They're already really mad at me.

09:06.987 --> 09:09.355
I might have an idea.

09:09.422 --> 09:10.556
<i>You're working</i>

09:10.624 --> 09:11.957
At the library?

09:12.025 --> 09:13.659
Why are you so surprised?

09:13.727 --> 09:14.660
I don't know.

09:14.728 --> 09:15.794
It just seems odd

09:15.862 --> 09:17.896
That someone would depend
on you to do anything.

09:17.964 --> 09:19.565
Hey, I'm dependable.

09:19.633 --> 09:21.400
And besides, they've got books laying around

09:21.468 --> 09:22.868
All over the place in there.

09:22.936 --> 09:23.936
So this is good.

09:24.004 --> 09:25.504
I'm helping them with their problem,

09:25.572 --> 09:27.673
And instead of paying me,
they're paying off the fines.

09:27.741 --> 09:29.608
It sounds like a pretty good

09:29.676 --> 09:31.477
Solution to me.

09:31.544 --> 09:33.445
Honey, don't eat any ice
cream before dinner.

09:33.513 --> 09:36.048
Well, when are we going to eat?

09:36.116 --> 09:37.049
I'm hungry.

09:37.117 --> 09:38.283
I don't know.

09:38.351 --> 09:39.418
That's a good question. Where's your mom?

09:39.486 --> 09:40.419
She's been in her room

09:40.487 --> 09:41.487
For the past couple hours.

09:46.926 --> 09:48.494
Hey, you hungry?

09:48.561 --> 09:50.095
Should I order some pizzas?

09:50.163 --> 09:52.297
No, no; we have some leftovers in the fridge

09:52.365 --> 09:53.632
I was going to heat up.

09:53.700 --> 09:55.200
I'm sorry, I got so caught up

09:55.268 --> 09:56.235
With these files.

09:56.302 --> 09:57.469
Still no luck?

09:57.537 --> 09:59.638
I've looked through every single person

09:59.706 --> 10:01.974
That devalos ever put away,
and none of them look like

10:02.042 --> 10:04.243
The man I saw leave that awful card.

10:04.310 --> 10:06.545
Well, maybe it's time to
pack it in for the night.

10:06.613 --> 10:07.646
I guess so.

10:07.714 --> 10:09.081
I just wish I could do something.

10:09.149 --> 10:10.416
I wish I could help.

10:10.483 --> 10:11.984
Well, wait a second.

10:12.052 --> 10:14.420
Aren't you actually that psychic woman

10:14.487 --> 10:16.321
Who, uh, gave the police

10:16.389 --> 10:19.091
A description of the guy who did this?

10:19.159 --> 10:20.125
Very funny.

10:20.193 --> 10:22.194
You know what I can't figure out?

10:22.262 --> 10:23.796
The pythagorean theorem?

10:25.165 --> 10:28.867
Last night, I had a dream about
devalos and his daughter.

10:28.935 --> 10:33.672
And in it, I saw him find a suicide note.

10:33.740 --> 10:35.674
I even heard what the note said.

10:35.742 --> 10:37.643
I mean, most of it, anyway.

10:37.711 --> 10:39.912
But then when I went to
his house this morning,

10:39.979 --> 10:42.815
His wife said that arianna
never left anything behind.

10:42.882 --> 10:44.483
Now, why would he do that?

10:44.551 --> 10:46.885
Why would he keep something
like that from her?

10:48.088 --> 10:49.254
I have no idea.

10:50.757 --> 10:53.325
Hey, you want to take the kids out?

10:53.393 --> 10:55.828
I know it's a school night, but, you know,

10:55.895 --> 10:59.031
It might be fun to take the kids out.

10:59.099 --> 11:01.200
<i>Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,</i>

11:01.267 --> 11:03.602
No attorney relishes the prospect

11:03.670 --> 11:05.637
Of taking on a case

11:05.705 --> 11:08.574
That involves the sexual
assault of a young woman.

11:08.641 --> 11:10.776
It forces us to ask uncomfortable questions

11:10.844 --> 11:13.145
About the personal behavior

11:13.213 --> 11:14.813
Of both the alleged assailant

11:14.881 --> 11:17.382
And the alleged victim.

11:17.450 --> 11:20.986
In this case, we will have to
look closely at what happened

11:21.054 --> 11:24.156
On the night that deanna whalen,
by her own admission,

11:24.224 --> 11:27.326
Willingly accompanied the
defendant back to his home.

11:28.995 --> 11:32.131
That they had sex not once, not twice,

11:32.198 --> 11:34.600
But three times over the
course of the evening

11:34.667 --> 11:36.101
Is not in dispute.

11:36.169 --> 11:39.538
And yet, miss whalen maintains
that a crime has been committed.

11:39.606 --> 11:43.509
That she gave him her
phone number the next day

11:43.576 --> 11:46.512
Is also not in dispute.

11:46.579 --> 11:49.548
But still, she claims that she
was not a willing participant

11:49.616 --> 11:51.250
In the previous evening's events.

11:51.317 --> 11:54.286
Miss whalen even concedes
that it took her three days

11:54.354 --> 11:57.790
Before deciding to call the police.

11:57.857 --> 11:59.525
And now she cites her inability

11:59.592 --> 12:02.594
To recall the precise events
of the evening as proof

12:02.662 --> 12:06.498
That mr. Gerwin must have
drugged her and raped her.

12:08.168 --> 12:10.903
Quite a story.

12:10.970 --> 12:12.771
But that's all it is.

12:12.839 --> 12:15.374
A story.

12:15.441 --> 12:17.342
And the district attorney knows it.

12:19.112 --> 12:22.815
Now, the prosecution will
attempt to portray the defendant

12:22.882 --> 12:25.017
As a man of low character, but he is not.

12:25.084 --> 12:28.320
They will paint my argument
as an attack on miss whalen,

12:28.388 --> 12:30.756
But it is not.

12:30.824 --> 12:33.692
Truth be told, my client
is guilty of nothing more

12:33.760 --> 12:35.961
Than participating in consensual sex,

12:36.029 --> 12:38.697
And the irony is,
his accuser is guilty of the same.

12:38.765 --> 12:40.999
And yet, she seeks to use this court

12:41.067 --> 12:45.270
And you, this jury,
as a kind of legal absolution,

12:45.338 --> 12:46.972
As a way to wash away her sins

12:47.040 --> 12:49.308
So she needn't take responsibility for them.

12:49.375 --> 12:52.077
There's only one problem with that.

12:52.145 --> 12:55.848
William gerwin is not a rapist.

12:55.915 --> 12:58.817
William gerwin is an innocent man.

13:05.203 --> 13:07.004
Yep. That's definitely him.

13:07.072 --> 13:10.674
That's definitely william gerwin.

13:10.742 --> 13:13.344
Back when I worked

13:13.411 --> 13:15.379
As a defense attorney at mcclenahan-everett,

13:15.447 --> 13:17.214
Mr. Gerwin was one of my clients.

13:17.282 --> 13:19.450
A rather important one, actually.

13:19.517 --> 13:22.786
He was the son of one of the partners.

13:22.854 --> 13:24.488
He was 22 when he was accused

13:24.556 --> 13:27.625
Of drugging and raping a young
woman that he met at a party.

13:27.692 --> 13:29.660
Her name was deanna whalen.

13:29.728 --> 13:32.830
Gerwin's father personally asked me

13:32.897 --> 13:34.531
To take his son's case as a favor.

13:34.599 --> 13:36.767
And...

13:36.835 --> 13:39.403
I was only too happy to oblige.

13:39.471 --> 13:41.872
The case was very weak.

13:41.940 --> 13:44.141
A classic "he-said, she-said."

13:44.209 --> 13:45.843
Rape kit was never administered.

13:45.910 --> 13:48.078
No drugs were found in the girl's system.

13:48.146 --> 13:49.913
She didn't even file a
report with the police

13:49.981 --> 13:52.716
Until several days after
the alleged incident.

13:52.784 --> 13:55.719
The ada who was handling
gerwin's prosecution

13:55.787 --> 13:57.221
Knew the odds were against him,

13:57.289 --> 13:59.056
And he offered me a deal early on,

13:59.124 --> 14:02.026
But I-I turned it down.

14:02.093 --> 14:05.162
That's how confident I was in the case.

14:05.230 --> 14:06.463
I remember that case.

14:06.531 --> 14:08.532
That kid wound up going to jail, didn't he?

14:10.135 --> 14:12.936
Someone sent a collection of videos

14:13.004 --> 14:14.238
To the district attorney's office

14:14.306 --> 14:15.906
In the middle of the trial.

14:15.974 --> 14:17.741
Never found out who sent them,

14:17.809 --> 14:21.145
But it didn't much matter.

14:21.212 --> 14:23.814
They were videos that
william had made of himself

14:23.882 --> 14:26.450
Having sex with unconscious
and obviously drugged women,

14:26.518 --> 14:28.686
Including deanna whalen.

14:28.753 --> 14:30.654
The deal I'd been offered

14:30.722 --> 14:32.222
Evaporated.

14:32.290 --> 14:34.224
William was given the maximum sentence,

14:34.292 --> 14:36.593
And I left mcclenaha
n-everett shortly after that.

14:36.661 --> 14:38.662
I-I'm sorry, sir.

14:38.730 --> 14:40.397
If he received a maximum sentence,

14:40.465 --> 14:42.833
Then how could he be the
one to leave you that card?

14:42.901 --> 14:46.837
Turns out, he was recently
granted an early parole.

14:46.905 --> 14:48.939
It seems that one of his cell mates

14:49.007 --> 14:50.441
Took him into his confidence one night,

14:50.508 --> 14:53.644
Told him the details of an unsolved murder,

14:53.712 --> 14:56.046
Something to do with organized crime.

14:56.114 --> 14:57.481
It was a federal case,

14:57.549 --> 15:00.150
So gerwin went to the local fbi office.

15:00.218 --> 15:02.286
And in exchange for his sealed testimony,

15:02.354 --> 15:04.388
Time was shaved off his sentence.

15:04.456 --> 15:05.989
As I understand it,

15:06.057 --> 15:08.125
Gerwin never even had to appear

15:08.193 --> 15:09.927
In open court.

15:09.994 --> 15:11.428
The man gerwin sent to jail

15:11.496 --> 15:14.031
Never even knew who offered him up.

15:16.034 --> 15:18.635
And you're absolutely
certain that william gerwin

15:18.703 --> 15:21.372
Is the man you saw put this card in the box?

15:21.439 --> 15:22.873
It was him, sir.

15:22.941 --> 15:24.441
I'm sure of it.

15:24.509 --> 15:26.076
I already reached out to his parole officer.

15:26.144 --> 15:28.712
We're bringing gerwin in for
questioning in a few hours.

15:28.780 --> 15:31.682
If he really was the one who
left that note in your mailbox,

15:31.750 --> 15:35.452
Well, let's just say

15:35.520 --> 15:37.588
I intend to make damn sure
he doesn't leave another.

15:40.358 --> 15:42.359
839.2...

15:53.304 --> 15:55.305
Whoa. Cool.

16:07.786 --> 16:09.586
Miss aiken, who's that guy?

16:09.654 --> 16:12.089
Oh, nobody special.

16:12.157 --> 16:15.726
Just a fellow who comes in
every day to use the computers.

16:32.010 --> 16:34.144
"prince"?

16:39.217 --> 16:41.452
No, I've never seen this card before.

16:43.154 --> 16:46.089
I certainly didn't leave it for mr. Devalos.

16:47.392 --> 16:48.459
So, is that it?

16:48.526 --> 16:50.160
Can I go now?

16:50.228 --> 16:51.328
Not just yet, mr. Gerwin.

16:51.396 --> 16:53.730
Okay.

16:53.798 --> 16:55.232
So what else do you want to talk about?

16:55.300 --> 16:57.968
How is the "man-man" doing, anyway?

16:58.036 --> 16:59.636
That's what my dad used to call him.

16:59.704 --> 17:03.607
Manny didn't like it very much,
but what can you do, right?

17:03.675 --> 17:06.175
Well, you seem to be
having a pretty good time.

17:06.243 --> 17:08.479
What would you say

17:08.546 --> 17:10.681
If I told you that we had an anonymous tip

17:10.748 --> 17:12.648
From someone who says that they saw you

17:12.717 --> 17:14.952
Put that card in devalos's mailbox?

17:15.019 --> 17:18.888
Well, the first thing I'd say is,
"your tipster is mistaken."

17:18.957 --> 17:21.391
But even if he or she weren't,

17:21.459 --> 17:23.126
What's with the hard-ass routine?

17:23.194 --> 17:26.829
I mean, whoever left this card,
did they do something illegal?

17:26.897 --> 17:30.634
Is there a law against mailing
people greeting cards?

17:30.702 --> 17:33.770
There are laws against harassment.

17:33.838 --> 17:35.739
And does this card break that law?

17:35.807 --> 17:37.808
Mr. Gerwin, you're on parole, right?

17:41.946 --> 17:44.448
If we want to, we can make
life very difficult for you.

17:46.150 --> 17:48.318
So why don't you just admit what you did,

17:48.386 --> 17:50.020
And we can get this thing cleared up today?

17:50.088 --> 17:52.489
Because I didn't do it.

17:52.557 --> 17:54.224
I've never been to his house.

17:54.292 --> 17:55.726
I haven't thought about him in years.

17:55.793 --> 17:56.894
You sure about that?

17:56.961 --> 17:59.396
The "man-man" was your lawyer.

17:59.464 --> 18:01.832
You got convicted.

18:01.900 --> 18:03.333
You're not holding a grudge?

18:03.401 --> 18:06.503
Why would I hold a grudge?

18:06.571 --> 18:08.839
I raped that girl.

18:08.907 --> 18:10.440
I went to jail.

18:10.508 --> 18:13.677
Why would I be mad at my attorney?

18:13.745 --> 18:15.412
Rich kid like you

18:15.480 --> 18:17.514
Probably had a pretty
rough go of it in prison.

18:17.582 --> 18:20.684
I wouldn't be surprised
if you got a little taste

18:20.752 --> 18:22.286
Of your own medicine, once or twice.

18:24.422 --> 18:26.924
Once or twice?

18:26.991 --> 18:30.627
I spent years getting "
a taste of my own medicine."

18:30.695 --> 18:32.896
That what you wanted to hear?

18:32.964 --> 18:35.499
That there's a ying for every yang?

18:35.567 --> 18:36.733
That I got what I deserve?

18:36.801 --> 18:39.803
Well... There it is.

18:42.106 --> 18:44.141
Now, if this card upset your boss,

18:44.208 --> 18:47.411
I don't know what to tell you.

18:47.478 --> 18:49.313
But me?

18:49.380 --> 18:51.048
The new me?

18:51.115 --> 18:54.418
I'm a firm believer that if
you get a card like this,

18:54.485 --> 18:55.586
You probably deserved it.

18:55.653 --> 19:00.324
So maybe you should be
sitting your boss down,

19:00.391 --> 19:04.328
Asking him why he thinks he got this.

19:04.395 --> 19:06.396
<i>He was so smug.</i>

19:06.464 --> 19:08.632
He was practically rubbing our noses

19:08.700 --> 19:10.067
In the fact that he did it.

19:10.134 --> 19:11.702
Well you've got to hand it to him.

19:11.769 --> 19:13.604
He figured out a way to get attention.

19:13.671 --> 19:15.872
To work out his anger at your boss.

19:15.940 --> 19:17.808
But he's on parole, right?

19:17.875 --> 19:19.343
He's essentially impotent.

19:19.410 --> 19:21.478
If he does anything,
he goes right back to jail.

19:21.546 --> 19:23.914
So he-he sends that card.

19:23.982 --> 19:25.983
He gets a rise out of a bunch of people.

19:26.050 --> 19:28.151
It's kind of like a child, don't you think?

19:28.219 --> 19:29.786
Like a child?

19:29.854 --> 19:31.355
He raped a teenage girl,

19:31.422 --> 19:33.256
And when he couldn't get away with it,

19:33.324 --> 19:34.424
He blamed his lawyer.

19:34.492 --> 19:36.560
There's nothing childlike about that.

19:36.628 --> 19:40.163
Uh, dad? Can you come look at the computer?

19:40.231 --> 19:42.833
Stay. Stew. Finish your beer.

19:42.900 --> 19:44.301
Finish my beer, if you like.

19:46.371 --> 19:47.704
I mean, look at this.
Suddenly, I have 200 e-mails

19:47.772 --> 19:49.139
That I didn't have this morning.

19:49.207 --> 19:51.775
I mean, I don't want to earn
six figures selling real estate

19:51.843 --> 19:53.377
In my spare time. I don't care

19:53.444 --> 19:55.779
About getting $5,
000 from "cash for clunkers"

19:55.847 --> 19:57.247
Without even turning in my car.

19:57.315 --> 19:59.416
And I don't want to hear from
this "prince abantu" again

19:59.484 --> 20:02.719
About how he can't get at
his $20 million inheritance.

20:02.787 --> 20:06.189
Did you guys say something
about prince abantu?

20:06.257 --> 20:08.659
Did you download the latest
version of spam blocker?

20:08.726 --> 20:11.595
No. You told me not to
download anything, so I didn't.

20:11.663 --> 20:13.363
Okay. Scoot over.

20:13.431 --> 20:14.831
Let me drive for a minute.

20:14.899 --> 20:16.967
Did someone say something
about prince abantu?

20:17.035 --> 20:19.603
Yeah. Why?

20:19.671 --> 20:20.804
I think I know him.

20:20.872 --> 20:24.374
You don't know him. He's not real.

20:24.442 --> 20:26.977
I mean, he's a scammer who
claims to be a nigerian prince

20:27.045 --> 20:30.380
Who needs help recovering
frozen assets from some trust.

20:30.448 --> 20:33.550
I mean, it's like, you give him $10,000,

20:33.618 --> 20:34.918
And he gives you a million.

20:34.986 --> 20:36.253
No. You're wrong.

20:36.320 --> 20:38.021
Prince abantu's a real guy.

20:38.089 --> 20:39.956
He goes to the library where I work.

20:40.024 --> 20:42.292
You can come visit him, if you want.

20:42.360 --> 20:44.461
I mean, he's there all the time.

20:44.529 --> 20:46.229
And I wouldn't delete that if I were you.

20:46.297 --> 20:48.131
All we have to do is
just send him some money,

20:48.199 --> 20:49.866
And then we can move into a bigger house.

20:49.934 --> 20:51.034
Bridgette.

20:51.102 --> 20:52.936
He doesn't look like a scammer to me.

20:53.004 --> 20:55.238
He looks like a prince.
I mean, he wears robes,

20:55.306 --> 20:57.607
And he carries this big stick thing and...

20:57.675 --> 20:59.409
I don't know who you saw, sweetie,

20:59.477 --> 21:01.545
But I got to side with ariel on this one.

21:01.612 --> 21:03.880
This is one of the oldest
tricks in the book.

21:03.948 --> 21:06.016
I've gotten 100 e-mails like this.

21:06.084 --> 21:07.284
People who send them aren't connected

21:07.351 --> 21:08.719
To african royalty

21:08.786 --> 21:10.887
In any way, shape, or form;
they're just criminals.

21:10.955 --> 21:14.825
Okay, but I think you're wrong.

21:14.892 --> 21:16.693
Okay.

21:16.761 --> 21:19.062
They were on a shelf in the bedroom;
hidden in plain sight.

21:19.130 --> 21:21.198
Obviously, the cops never
bothered to actually look

21:21.265 --> 21:23.266
At the tapes when they searched his place.

21:23.334 --> 21:25.869
My people didn't, either,
the first time through.

21:25.937 --> 21:29.239
It's a good thing you sent
me to take a second look.

21:29.307 --> 21:30.741
Look inside.

21:36.447 --> 21:38.515
Is this what I think it is?

21:38.583 --> 21:40.584
Take a look.

21:45.923 --> 21:47.924
Here, have some of this.
Have a little drink.

21:47.992 --> 21:49.893
Um, I don't...

21:52.563 --> 21:53.797
No?

21:53.865 --> 21:54.965
Uh, no. No?

21:55.032 --> 21:56.633
I don't feel so good.

21:56.701 --> 21:57.834
No?

21:57.902 --> 21:59.269
No. No?

21:59.337 --> 22:00.904
No, I don't feel so good.

22:00.972 --> 22:02.506
No?

22:04.075 --> 22:05.542
Oh...

22:06.711 --> 22:08.011
The others are just as bad.

22:08.079 --> 22:10.480
Different girls, same drill.

22:10.548 --> 22:12.349
I know it's not what you were

22:12.416 --> 22:14.518
Hoping I'd find, but at least now you know.

22:14.585 --> 22:16.620
You'll be ready if there are
other copies floating around

22:16.687 --> 22:18.955
For the prosecution to latch onto.

22:22.126 --> 22:23.160
You want me

22:23.227 --> 22:24.161
To accidentally drop these

22:24.228 --> 22:25.395
In an incinerator?

22:25.463 --> 22:28.965
No, that's, uh, that's not necessary.

22:29.033 --> 22:30.300
I'll take care of them.

22:30.368 --> 22:32.102
Thank you, walter.

23:16.198 --> 23:19.994
I'm telling you manuel devalos
torpedoed his own case.

23:20.552 --> 23:23.721
Manuel devalos, the most honest, ethical man

23:23.788 --> 23:25.222
I've ever met.

23:25.290 --> 23:28.125
Not the second-most honest and
ethical man you've ever met?

23:28.193 --> 23:30.127
Oh, come on, joe.

23:30.195 --> 23:32.396
Why would he do that?

23:32.464 --> 23:33.864
I don't know.

23:33.932 --> 23:35.933
Maybe, maybe 'cause he knew

23:36.000 --> 23:38.602
The guy he was representing was guilty?

23:38.670 --> 23:41.338
Maybe he was sick of representing rich scum.

23:41.406 --> 23:44.575
Or maybe he just wanted to give
lawyers everywhere a good name.

23:44.642 --> 23:46.410
No, I'm sorry.

23:46.478 --> 23:48.312
None of that explains it.

23:48.379 --> 23:50.714
If he couldn't represent his
client in good conscience,

23:50.782 --> 23:53.450
Then he should have just
resigned from the case.

23:53.518 --> 23:56.754
What he did was a violation
of attorney-client privilege.

23:56.821 --> 23:58.956
Hell, what he did was illegal.

23:59.023 --> 24:02.726
But don't you kind of admire him for it?

24:02.794 --> 24:06.363
A bad man, a dangerous man,

24:06.431 --> 24:08.966
Who might otherwise have
walked free, went to jail.

24:09.033 --> 24:11.034
Sorry. I'm on team devalos.

24:11.102 --> 24:14.037
Yeah, well, if the truth be told,

24:14.105 --> 24:16.607
So am I.

24:16.674 --> 24:18.609
But why am I dreaming this?

24:18.676 --> 24:20.444
What am I supposed to do with it?

24:20.512 --> 24:23.380
I've been waiting for one
this easy for a long time.

24:23.448 --> 24:25.382
You do nothing.

24:25.450 --> 24:29.119
And you admire your boss
just a little bit more.

24:29.187 --> 24:30.354
I know I do.

24:30.421 --> 24:32.556
And you definitely don't say anything

24:32.624 --> 24:33.857
To anybody about this.

24:33.925 --> 24:36.193
That's what you do.

24:49.007 --> 24:50.007
Hey.

24:50.074 --> 24:51.108
Thanks for coming by.

24:51.176 --> 24:54.111
Everything okay?

24:54.179 --> 24:55.279
Honestly, I'm not sure.

24:55.346 --> 24:57.281
This is a weird one.

24:57.348 --> 24:59.316
A girl named jennifer
ludlow rents this place.

24:59.384 --> 25:00.317
She's a bartender.

25:00.385 --> 25:01.585
Community college student.

25:01.653 --> 25:04.421
Slept at her boyfriend's place last night.

25:04.489 --> 25:05.923
Gets home early this morning,

25:05.990 --> 25:07.257
Finds the door like that.

25:07.325 --> 25:09.526
Someone forced their way into her place.

25:09.594 --> 25:11.428
But she's all right?

25:11.496 --> 25:13.797
Oh, yeah, she's fine; there was no one here.

25:13.865 --> 25:15.065
There's nothing missing, either.

25:15.133 --> 25:16.700
So what are we doing here?

25:20.171 --> 25:21.505
Someone put one of these

25:21.573 --> 25:24.408
In every picture frame in the place.

25:26.177 --> 25:28.478
Okay, I'll ask. What is this?

25:28.546 --> 25:29.847
Can't say for sure.

25:29.914 --> 25:33.183
Seems like someone's trying
to send manny a message.

25:33.251 --> 25:35.619
I know what you're thinking:
Our friend william gerwin.

25:35.687 --> 25:37.654
The problem is the scene's clean.

25:37.722 --> 25:39.857
So far, we haven't found any
physical evidence at all.

25:39.924 --> 25:41.425
None of the neighbors saw anything.

25:41.492 --> 25:42.459
We got bupkis.

25:42.527 --> 25:44.394
Does devalos know about this?

25:44.462 --> 25:45.996
He didn't want to come down.

25:46.064 --> 25:47.431
Just said, "thanks for telling me."

25:47.498 --> 25:48.498
Seemed kind of distracted.

25:48.566 --> 25:51.301
Anyway, feel free to look around.

25:51.369 --> 25:53.237
And holler if you get a bite.

25:53.304 --> 25:55.639
Of course.

25:55.707 --> 25:58.642
You've reached the voicemail
of manuel devalos.

25:58.710 --> 26:00.110
Please leave a message,

26:00.178 --> 26:02.813
And I'll get back to you as
soon as I can. Take this.

26:02.881 --> 26:05.082
Sir, can you give me a
call when you get this?

26:05.149 --> 26:08.118
I'm just leaving that woman
jennifer ludlow's apartment.

26:08.186 --> 26:09.419
Unfortunately, I didn't see anything

26:09.487 --> 26:10.954
That could be of any help,

26:11.022 --> 26:15.158
But I do need to talk to
you about your old client.

26:29.707 --> 26:32.042
We meet again.

26:32.110 --> 26:33.277
You did this.

26:33.344 --> 26:35.646
Sorry? Did what?

26:35.713 --> 26:37.681
Don't play coy.

26:37.749 --> 26:39.950
We both know what you're doing
and why you're doing it.

26:40.018 --> 26:41.184
Really?

26:41.252 --> 26:43.387
You know why?

26:43.454 --> 26:45.789
Well, if that's the case,

26:45.857 --> 26:47.891
If you really know what went on with me

26:47.959 --> 26:49.159
And my legal representation,

26:49.227 --> 26:51.762
Then I'm sure you share my sense of outrage.

26:51.829 --> 26:53.597
See, I think I deserve

26:53.665 --> 26:56.166
What every other accused citizen deserves:

26:56.234 --> 26:57.801
A fair trial.

26:57.869 --> 27:01.004
And that means having a defense
attorney who's not serving me up

27:01.072 --> 27:03.473
On a silver platter to the prosecution.

27:03.541 --> 27:05.375
What do you want?

27:05.443 --> 27:07.511
How is harassing this man
gonna change anything?

27:07.578 --> 27:10.347
Are you aware that after I was convicted,

27:10.415 --> 27:11.581
My family disowned me?

27:11.649 --> 27:15.085
It's true.

27:15.153 --> 27:17.554
So not only did I spend
all those years in prison,

27:17.622 --> 27:19.056
I came out with nothing.

27:19.123 --> 27:22.426
I'm a convicted felon. And I'm penniless.

27:22.493 --> 27:24.995
That man-- your boss--

27:25.063 --> 27:27.464
He destroyed me.

27:27.532 --> 27:30.200
So what do I want?

27:32.003 --> 27:35.038
<i>I guess I'd like to destroy him.</i>

27:35.106 --> 27:38.408
I want him to come forward
and admit what he did.

27:38.476 --> 27:39.876
I want him to lose his job.

27:39.944 --> 27:42.446
And I want him to go to jail.

27:42.513 --> 27:43.647
Well, that's crazy.

27:43.715 --> 27:45.382
That's never gonna happen.

27:45.450 --> 27:50.087
Oh, I think it might.

27:50.154 --> 27:51.922
You know, I was really hoping

27:51.990 --> 27:53.890
That manny was gonna come
down here this morning.

27:53.958 --> 27:56.526
But you seem pretty close to him.

27:56.594 --> 27:58.829
Maybe you could give him a message for me.

27:58.896 --> 28:03.066
There's a reason why all
those articles wound up

28:03.134 --> 28:05.168
In jennifer ludlow's apartment.

28:05.236 --> 28:08.271
She's young, pretty.

28:08.339 --> 28:10.674
Just my type.

28:10.742 --> 28:13.343
I don't understand.

28:13.411 --> 28:14.644
Sometime soon,

28:14.712 --> 28:16.947
If the district attorney
doesn't come forward

28:17.015 --> 28:18.248
And admit what he did,

28:18.316 --> 28:21.118
I'm gonna rape jennifer ludlow.

28:24.956 --> 28:26.923
You should say something.

28:26.991 --> 28:29.292
You really are insane.

28:29.360 --> 28:32.262
You know, the act of just
making that threat is

28:32.330 --> 28:34.264
A violation of your parole?

28:34.332 --> 28:35.599
You're going back to jail.

28:35.666 --> 28:37.634
I don't think so.

28:37.702 --> 28:39.703
Are you wearing a tape recorder?

28:39.771 --> 28:42.372
'cause if anyone asks if I made the threat,

28:42.440 --> 28:43.774
I'll deny it.

28:43.841 --> 28:45.342
You'll never get near that that girl.

28:45.410 --> 28:47.110
We will have people protecting her.

28:47.178 --> 28:48.545
We'll have people following you.

28:48.613 --> 28:50.414
Yeah, okay, but how close can they get?

28:50.481 --> 28:54.051
Can they follow me everywhere?

28:54.118 --> 28:57.020
If someone were following me right now,

28:57.088 --> 29:00.590
Do you really think they
could stop me from, say, uh,

29:00.658 --> 29:02.592
Breaking your neck?

29:05.329 --> 29:08.498
If I didn't care about getting
caught, that is, and...

29:08.566 --> 29:10.567
I don't.

29:12.370 --> 29:13.737
Look, I get it.

29:13.805 --> 29:15.472
You and the people you work with,

29:15.540 --> 29:17.574
You're gonna do what you're gonna do.

29:17.642 --> 29:19.609
You'll be watching pretty little jenny

29:19.677 --> 29:22.145
And you'll be watching pretty little me.

29:22.213 --> 29:23.380
So maybe it'll be her.

29:23.448 --> 29:25.816
Maybe it'll be someone else.

29:25.883 --> 29:28.285
The important thing is is that devalos knows

29:28.352 --> 29:30.654
About all this ahead of time.

29:30.721 --> 29:34.758
That way, if he doesn't step up,

29:34.826 --> 29:37.527
The girl I find...

29:37.595 --> 29:40.530
She won't just be my victim,

29:40.598 --> 29:43.266
She'll be his victim, too.

29:45.837 --> 29:48.505
Pretty good, right?

29:48.573 --> 29:50.173
That'll kill him, won't it?

29:50.241 --> 29:51.942
Good man like devalos.

29:52.009 --> 29:54.010
Respected man.

29:54.078 --> 29:56.513
No way he'll be able to live with himself

29:56.581 --> 29:58.815
If he let's that happen.

30:17.001 --> 30:19.936
I know who you are, you know.

30:20.004 --> 30:21.071
Pardon me?

30:21.139 --> 30:22.339
I know you're a prince.

30:22.406 --> 30:23.740
I know about the problem.

30:23.808 --> 30:26.276
I know about the money,
and I want to help you.

30:26.344 --> 30:29.779
I've got a little more than $38 saved up.

30:29.847 --> 30:33.083
But I know it's not much,
but it's what I've got.

30:33.151 --> 30:34.818
And when you get all that money

30:34.886 --> 30:36.486
That you've been writing to people about,

30:36.554 --> 30:38.622
You can pay me back.

30:38.689 --> 30:39.756
I just want enough

30:39.824 --> 30:42.092
To cover my library debt: $92.18.

30:42.160 --> 30:44.728
I think you are mistaken, little girl.

30:44.795 --> 30:48.031
You've got me mixed up with somebody.

30:48.099 --> 30:49.966
You don't have to pretend with me.

30:50.034 --> 30:52.502
I know you're a prince, okay?

30:52.570 --> 30:53.870
I've read the e-mails.

30:53.938 --> 30:55.739
And I know that you have enemies everywhere,

30:55.806 --> 30:57.974
But I'm not one of them.

30:58.042 --> 31:00.744
And look, even if you don't
get all your money back,

31:00.811 --> 31:02.312
I want you to have this.

31:04.615 --> 31:07.951
I'm sorry, young lady,
but you've got me mixed up.

31:08.019 --> 31:09.052
I must get going.

31:09.120 --> 31:11.321
No, you can't just not take my money

31:11.389 --> 31:13.924
Because I'm a little kid; that's not fair.

31:16.527 --> 31:17.794
Okay, okay, fine.

31:17.862 --> 31:19.529
Okay, give it to me.

31:28.139 --> 31:30.106
Isn't it a little early?

31:32.143 --> 31:35.645
No, what it is, is... A little cowardly.

31:35.713 --> 31:38.582
What it is, is selfish.

31:38.649 --> 31:41.284
Your timing is impeccable.

31:41.352 --> 31:44.621
I was  a minute from making a clean getaway.

31:44.689 --> 31:47.457
Your assistant told me
where I could find you.

31:48.893 --> 31:50.827
Sir...

31:50.895 --> 31:53.563
We really need to talk.

31:55.199 --> 31:57.934
So all I have to do to prevent this lunatic

31:58.002 --> 31:59.703
From keeping his promise is step forward

31:59.770 --> 32:02.806
And declare myself a criminal?

32:02.873 --> 32:05.075
He knows what you did, sir.

32:05.142 --> 32:10.013
I don't know how he knows, but he knows.

32:10.081 --> 32:11.581
And I know it, too.

32:13.851 --> 32:16.953
Look, I would never secon
d-guess what you did.

32:17.021 --> 32:20.590
I might have done the same thing.

32:20.658 --> 32:23.093
And I know how much you stand to lose.

32:23.160 --> 32:26.229
But unless there's something I'm not seeing,

32:26.297 --> 32:30.800
I don't think you can keep
this a secret much longer.

32:30.868 --> 32:35.205
I think you need to start
telling people what you did.

32:35.273 --> 32:37.674
And not to give in to him...

32:37.742 --> 32:40.010
But to keep him from doing something

32:40.077 --> 32:42.712
That you would never recover from.

32:42.780 --> 32:44.781
I mean...

32:44.849 --> 32:47.517
If he hurt some girl...

32:47.585 --> 32:50.320
I don't think you could live with that.

32:52.356 --> 32:55.792
There's a lot you're not seeing, allison.

32:55.860 --> 32:58.795
But I appreciate your concern.

33:04.335 --> 33:05.669
Uh, sir?

33:08.072 --> 33:10.440
Sir, I'm a part of this, too, now.

33:10.508 --> 33:13.643
I don't want to be, but I am.

33:13.711 --> 33:16.680
If you don't come forward...

33:16.747 --> 33:19.516
I don't know, I might have to.

33:21.519 --> 33:25.922
Well, I guess we're each
gonna do what we have to do.

33:31.028 --> 33:34.331
<i>I can say anything to you,
right, dad?</i>

33:34.398 --> 33:37.701
<i>Well, this is the last thing
you need to know,</i>

33:37.768 --> 33:39.402
<i>The thing you're never gonna get</i>

33:39.470 --> 33:41.838
<i>To help me deal with.</i>

33:41.906 --> 33:44.741
<i>This thing that's been
living inside me,</i>

33:44.809 --> 33:47.277
<i>This cloud that I can't get out from
under,</i>

33:47.345 --> 33:50.080
<i>It's always been there,
but it started to get worse</i>

33:50.147 --> 33:51.981
<i>During my senior year of high school.</i>

33:52.049 --> 33:54.984
<i>Kim and I went to this party.</i>

33:55.052 --> 33:58.355
<i>It was mostly college kids home
for their christmas break.</i>

33:58.422 --> 34:00.123
<i>There was a boy there.</i>

34:00.191 --> 34:02.759
<i>His name was william.</i>

34:02.827 --> 34:05.695
<i>He was a little older, cute, funny.</i>

34:05.763 --> 34:08.831
<i>I liked him, so I pretended
to be older.</i>

34:08.899 --> 34:11.134
<i>He kept giving me drinks.</i>

34:11.202 --> 34:12.869
<i>I started to feel funny,</i>

34:12.937 --> 34:16.172
<i>So he asked me if I
needed to lie down.</i>

34:16.239 --> 34:18.942
<i>He helped me upstairs. And the rest?</i>

34:19.009 --> 34:24.514
<i>Well, you're defending him now;
you know what he does.</i>

34:24.581 --> 34:26.882
<i>I was barely awake for any of it.</i>

34:26.951 --> 34:28.685
<i>All I knew the next day</i>

34:28.753 --> 34:32.322
<i>Was that something sick had happened to
me.</i>

34:32.389 --> 34:35.425
<i>When I read about your case in the
papers,</i>

34:35.493 --> 34:38.561
<i>When I realized how many other
girls he'd done it to,</i>

34:38.629 --> 34:41.231
<i>How maybe I could have stopped it all</i>

34:41.297 --> 34:44.266
<i>If I had been braver and
said something,</i>

34:44.335 --> 34:46.902
<i>Well, that's when all this started.</i>

34:46.971 --> 34:48.438
<i>I'm sorry, daddy.</i>

34:48.505 --> 34:50.873
<i>I should have said something to you.</i>

35:13.047 --> 35:13.113
Sir.

35:20.188 --> 35:22.356
I've...

35:22.423 --> 35:24.458
I'm so sorry.

35:25.860 --> 35:28.795
I had a dream last night,

35:28.863 --> 35:30.497
And in it...

35:30.565 --> 35:33.200
: I saw ev-everything.

35:34.369 --> 35:37.204
Now I know why you did what you did.

35:38.840 --> 35:43.076
I'm so sorry if I was
short with you yesterday,

35:43.144 --> 35:46.847
So sorry about what happened to arianna...

35:46.914 --> 35:49.516
To you and lily.

35:49.584 --> 35:51.685
For everything.

35:53.721 --> 35:56.823
Thank you.

35:56.891 --> 35:59.126
It's been quite a burden.

36:00.528 --> 36:04.698
The hardest part has been
keeping my wife in the dark.

36:06.301 --> 36:09.336
Unfortunately, it looks like that's...

36:09.404 --> 36:11.405
No longer an option.

36:15.376 --> 36:17.844
<i>You are gonna come forward?</i>

36:17.912 --> 36:19.880
I don't think I really have a choice.

36:22.283 --> 36:24.718
I should have put it all together sooner.

36:26.954 --> 36:29.589
The obituaries that he
was leaving everywhere...

36:32.193 --> 36:34.161
That's how he figured it all out--

36:34.228 --> 36:36.930
He must have come across one in prison

36:36.998 --> 36:39.599
And when he saw her picture,
imagine his surprise

36:39.667 --> 36:41.268
When he realized that he raped

36:41.336 --> 36:43.203
The daughter of his own defense attorney.

36:44.939 --> 36:46.573
I'm gonna call a press conference

36:46.641 --> 36:47.574
Tomorrow, late afternoon,

36:47.642 --> 36:50.577
Admit what I did.

36:50.645 --> 36:54.114
Lily's away on a trip with some friends.

36:54.182 --> 36:56.450
I want to speak with her first.

36:56.517 --> 36:58.251
After that, I'll speak with the press.

36:58.319 --> 37:00.354
Hopefully, the fact that there's going to be

37:00.421 --> 37:01.888
A press conference will be enough

37:01.956 --> 37:05.425
To keep mr. Gerwin at bay for a day.

37:08.062 --> 37:11.131
I'm gonna miss this place.

37:12.800 --> 37:14.401
Regal man: Excuse me.

37:14.469 --> 37:16.603
This is for you.

37:16.671 --> 37:20.874
Wow. You already have my, uh, $92.18?

37:20.942 --> 37:23.877
No, it's just what you gave me yesterday.

37:23.945 --> 37:25.278
I can't keep it.

37:25.346 --> 37:26.913
I don't care what you say.

37:26.981 --> 37:29.082
You know, uh,

37:29.150 --> 37:31.218
I've only been doing this
for a couple of weeks.

37:31.285 --> 37:32.552
I'm not proud of it.

37:32.620 --> 37:34.688
It's just, uh, I haven't worked in a while,

37:34.756 --> 37:37.758
And I was hoping to get a
little bit of money coming in.

37:37.825 --> 37:41.495
But the truth is, your $38 was all I got,

37:41.562 --> 37:45.432
And, uh, I didn't set out
to swindle little girls.

37:45.500 --> 37:47.100
So you're not a prince?

37:47.168 --> 37:49.102
why are you dressed like that?

37:49.170 --> 37:50.504
Bridgette?

37:50.571 --> 37:53.273
When you're done with those,
would you come help me

37:53.341 --> 37:55.008
In the children's section, please?

37:55.076 --> 37:56.209
Yeah, sure.

37:56.277 --> 37:57.944
Um, miss aiken,

37:58.012 --> 37:59.346
This is prince abantu.

37:59.414 --> 38:00.647
He's from nigeria.

38:00.715 --> 38:02.849
Nice to meet you.

38:02.917 --> 38:04.718
Yeah, you, too.

38:06.254 --> 38:07.421
Bye.

38:07.488 --> 38:08.989
Bye-bye.

38:15.029 --> 38:16.263
Well, at least

38:16.330 --> 38:19.466
One of the dubois women
is happy in her work.

38:19.534 --> 38:21.401
<i>Bridgette loves working
at the library.</i>

38:21.469 --> 38:23.036
She doesn't even mind the fact

38:23.104 --> 38:25.272
That you can't really talk in there.

38:25.339 --> 38:27.207
Will hate to see it end.

38:27.275 --> 38:30.076
Meets all kinds of interesting people.

38:30.144 --> 38:33.180
Even helped a nice young girl
set up an e-mail account.

38:33.247 --> 38:34.581
Hmm?

38:36.417 --> 38:39.753
Come on, bridgette dubois,
librarian at large?

38:39.821 --> 38:42.489
Isn't that good for at least a smile?

38:43.658 --> 38:46.092
Hmm. Well, I guess not.

38:47.295 --> 38:49.763
Hey, come on, I mean...

38:49.831 --> 38:53.700
I just, I can't stand the thought of
this monster getting away with this,

38:53.768 --> 38:56.603
The thought of devalos
losing his job, his license.

38:56.671 --> 38:58.805
Look, I know he made a mistake,

38:58.873 --> 39:01.842
But the truth is, if that had
been one of our daughters,

39:01.909 --> 39:03.944
I would've done the same thing.

39:04.011 --> 39:06.246
I think he showed remarkable restraint

39:06.314 --> 39:09.549
In not murdering the son of a bitch.

39:21.462 --> 39:22.662
See? It's easy.

39:22.730 --> 39:25.265
Now you can write
e-mails to whoever you want.

39:25.333 --> 39:27.434
Wow. Thanks.

39:27.502 --> 39:29.035
You're a very smart kid.

39:29.103 --> 39:31.238
Yeah, well, I get that a lot.

39:32.740 --> 39:35.609
Actually, can you help
me with one more thing?

39:35.676 --> 39:37.777
I'm not a very good typist.

39:37.845 --> 39:40.180
I always feel like I have ten thumbs.

39:40.248 --> 39:43.283
Is there any way you could
type up an e-mail for me?

39:52.493 --> 39:55.929
Don't be upset with me.

39:55.997 --> 39:58.465
Arianna...

39:58.533 --> 40:01.201
Arianna, what are you talking about?

40:01.269 --> 40:03.270
What are you doing here?

40:04.472 --> 40:08.208
That e-mail I had your little girl type...

40:08.276 --> 40:11.378
It went to a crime boss named tom harper.

40:11.445 --> 40:14.481
William gerwin got his
parole by agreeing to testify

40:14.549 --> 40:16.383
In an organized crime case.

40:16.450 --> 40:18.885
He sent away one of tom
harper's top lieutenants.

40:18.953 --> 40:22.255
Harper never knew who the snitch was.

40:22.323 --> 40:24.491
That is, until now.

40:24.559 --> 40:25.959
Oh, my god, you do know

40:26.027 --> 40:28.395
What that man is gonna
do to gerwin, don't you?

40:28.462 --> 40:29.629
Absolutely.

40:29.697 --> 40:31.831
And by the way, he's already done it.

40:31.899 --> 40:35.669
Gerwin is already dead?

40:35.736 --> 40:38.838
It happened about an hour ago.

40:38.906 --> 40:42.642
That man took everything from me.

40:42.710 --> 40:44.978
There's no way I could let him take

40:45.046 --> 40:47.447
Everything from my dad, too.

40:47.515 --> 40:50.750
I want what he did to remain a secret.

40:50.818 --> 40:53.653
Well, I'm sure it will.

40:53.721 --> 40:56.590
Now... Maybe...

40:56.657 --> 41:00.360
Maybe there's no reason
for anyone to know now.

41:00.428 --> 41:02.662
Good.

41:04.098 --> 41:07.734
But there is one person who
deserves to know the truth...

41:07.802 --> 41:10.971
Who needs to know the truth.

41:11.038 --> 41:14.641
Will you do something for me?

41:14.709 --> 41:18.178
Get my father to do something for me?

41:18.245 --> 41:20.213
<i>I love you, dad.</i>

41:20.281 --> 41:21.514
<i>And I love you, mom.</i>

41:21.582 --> 41:23.683
Devalos & arianna:
"you both gave me so much love,

41:23.751 --> 41:27.454
"and I'm taking that with
me wherever I'm going.

41:27.521 --> 41:31.257
Devalos : "now you'll need
to give it to each other.

41:31.325 --> 41:33.760
"goodbye, daddy.

41:33.828 --> 41:36.029
"goodbye, mommy.

41:36.097 --> 41:38.965
I love you. Arianna."
