Put that back !

04:03.002 --> 04:06.509
Hey, I just washed
all this stuff.

04:06.509 --> 04:08.514
It's my gear.
Sorry, man.

04:08.514 --> 04:11.020
It's okay.
What's my mom
screaming about ?

04:11.020 --> 04:14.528
She's bummed 'cause I
snaked your last bagel.

04:14.528 --> 04:19.039
Grab a shovel,
man.
No, I just
wanna munch.

04:19.039 --> 04:21.043
You don't wanna help,
that's just fine.

04:21.043 --> 04:26.055
Uh-huh.
You know, this is a total waste of time.

04:26.055 --> 04:30.064
Dave, be more of a geek.
There's no way
you're going to the prom.

04:30.064 --> 04:32.569
You're a disease.
Ahh.

04:32.569 --> 04:36.078
And no one will ever swim
in this stupid pool.
Hey !

04:36.078 --> 04:37.581
Later.

04:37.581 --> 04:42.092
Look, David,
please do me a favor
and stress less, bro.

04:42.092 --> 04:44.096
High school
is over, buddy.

04:44.096 --> 04:47.103
Get into it.
We're losers.

04:47.103 --> 04:50.110
I've decided something, stoney.
I wanna look back on
my high school career,

04:50.611 --> 04:53.618
and think that I started
slowly but I finished
strong, you know ?

04:54.119 --> 04:56.625
High school's almost over
and I don't have
anything to show for it.

04:57.126 --> 05:00.634
I know, me neither.
You should be stoked
though, buddy,

05:00.634 --> 05:03.641
'cause you got through
the last four years without
the full-on melon tweekage.

05:03.641 --> 05:08.152
It's not enough.
I mean, I want my own
page in the yearbook.

05:08.152 --> 05:13.163
Jump off the gym,
splatter on the street
and go for the co-ver.

05:13.163 --> 05:16.671
It's not funny.
I'm not goin' down as
this geek kid from Encino.

05:16.671 --> 05:21.182
When I finish this pool,
I'm gonna have the
killer party after the prom.

05:21.182 --> 05:25.692
I'm gonna be the prom king !
And I'm gonna graduate a legend.

05:27.195 --> 05:29.701
Well, what about me ?

05:30.202 --> 05:32.708
Oh, well you'll
be there too.

05:32.708 --> 05:38.721
Thanks, but Robyn sweeney,
she's not goin' to
the prom with you, man.

05:38.721 --> 05:42.230
-I wish she would but she's not.
-What are you talkin' about ?

05:42.230 --> 05:44.735
Robyn sweeney
is mine.

05:44.735 --> 05:47.242
She's become a major babe
and she loves me.

05:47.242 --> 05:50.249
She finds you crusty,
Dave.
I'll convince her.

05:50.249 --> 05:53.756
She'll see
the truth.
Truth is...

05:54.258 --> 05:57.265
Life's about greasin'
the do-back, buddy
and weasin' on the buffest.

05:57.765 --> 05:59.770
High school was
interesting, right,

05:59.770 --> 06:02.777
but it was kind of
like a harsh ride.
O-o-o-ow.

06:03.278 --> 06:05.283
We're goin' on to bigger
and better things, buddy.

06:05.283 --> 06:08.791
Stoney, I am on to
bigger and better things.

06:10.795 --> 06:14.304
Count on it !

06:26.832 --> 06:28.837
Oh, wow !
Hey, what's up ?

06:28.837 --> 06:32.345
♪ I'm a stoney crusty dude
♪ Did you know that ?
Get out, dude.

06:32.846 --> 06:35.352
♪ I got a mop on top ♪
Watch out !

06:35.352 --> 06:40.364
Excuse me. Could you move.
Me and my friend, David
are comin' through.

06:40.364 --> 06:43.371
Hey, there's Robyn.
Hey, Robyn.
O-o-o-ow !

06:50.387 --> 06:53.394
Four-wheelin'
over the ferns.

06:53.894 --> 06:57.403
Look, Dave, you're gonna
have to mellow out, bro,
on this whole Robyn thing.

06:57.403 --> 07:00.911
She always shines ya.
You don't understand.
We have history.

07:01.412 --> 07:05.421
You had pre-freshman
history. You could've
had her back then.

07:05.421 --> 07:08.929
She hadn't hit
"babehood" yet.

07:08.929 --> 07:12.438
Milk does a body good.
Check her.

07:12.438 --> 07:14.943
She's clean, buddy,

07:14.943 --> 07:17.950
and he's got her.

07:17.950 --> 07:21.458
Matt Wilson ?
What a jerk.

07:21.458 --> 07:23.463
What does she
see in him anyway ?

07:23.463 --> 07:27.472
He's got the buff spikes
chillin' the top of his melon.

07:27.973 --> 07:30.479
Dude, he's checkin'
her cheeks. Ooh !

07:30.479 --> 07:35.991
He's got the serious beak,
his own personal... oh !
Holding company,

07:35.991 --> 07:37.996
full of fundage, bro,

07:37.996 --> 07:43.509
that he weases off of ma--jor.

07:43.509 --> 07:46.014
Eighteen inch bi's.
Bye-bye.

07:46.014 --> 07:48.019
Mine are only four.

07:48.019 --> 07:50.024
Besides that.

07:50.024 --> 07:52.028
He walks like this,
right ?

07:52.028 --> 07:56.037
Just like this,
the nugs fully loose.

08:07.564 --> 08:10.070
Hi, Matt.

08:11.072 --> 08:13.077
Hi, Matt.

08:13.077 --> 08:15.081
All right, everybody.
Quiet, please.

08:15.081 --> 08:18.590
Settle down, quiet. We're gonna start
this week's class...

08:18.590 --> 08:20.594
Same place we ended
last week's class.

08:20.594 --> 08:23.100
That's talking about prehistoric man
in the what ?

08:23.100 --> 08:25.606
Prehistoric man in the -- ?
Oh, stoney ?

08:26.107 --> 08:30.116
- Ice age.
- Yes, ice age. That's right, the ice age.

08:30.116 --> 08:33.123
Why do we call it the ice age ?
'Cause there was a lot of ice.

08:33.123 --> 08:36.631
What do we call
these big chunks of ice,
those big slabs of ice ?

08:36.631 --> 08:39.135
We called what ?
What do we call them ?
Glaciers.

08:39.135 --> 08:42.645
Right. You are paying
attention. That's good.

08:42.645 --> 08:45.652
These glaciers, as they
moved down our way,

08:45.652 --> 08:49.661
they're so heavy, cold
and thick that they
freeze the ground water...

08:49.661 --> 08:52.668
- And they form underground -- ?
- Glaciers.

08:52.668 --> 08:57.680
Right. Believe it or not, some scientists
believe that there are actual...

08:57.680 --> 09:00.687
Underground glacial movements
still in this part of the world.

09:00.687 --> 09:02.691
You know what I think
that is, class ?

09:03.192 --> 09:06.700
Lame !
Exactly. Bunco, bogus.

09:06.700 --> 09:09.206
Listen,
please remember...

09:09.206 --> 09:12.714
That most of this hemisphere,
including the ground
I'm walking on,

09:12.714 --> 09:14.719
all of this was under ice
at some point, so I guess...

09:15.219 --> 09:17.726
Finding something frozen,
dug up here or there,

09:17.726 --> 09:19.730
wouldn't be that uncommon
when you think about it.

09:20.231 --> 09:23.340
So moving right along
on your journey of knowledge,

09:23.340 --> 09:26.581
- Here, let me show you cro-magnon man.
- Woo !

09:27.249 --> 09:29.754
He's dope.
I'd go out with him.

09:29.754 --> 09:31.759
No, no.

09:32.261 --> 09:36.271
I don't think so, Ella.
Cro-magnon man, even though
he's not bad-lookin',

09:36.271 --> 09:38.776
he's standin' upright and all,
he was extremely brutal.

09:38.776 --> 09:41.282
He just took
whatever he wanted...

09:41.784 --> 09:43.788
And that included
his women.

09:43.788 --> 09:46.795
That's barbaric !
Indeed.

10:03.836 --> 10:06.843
Stone !
Stoney !

10:14.863 --> 10:18.872
Hey ! Come on,
check this out.
That's my lobes.

10:18.872 --> 10:22.882
Feel the ground,
man.

10:22.882 --> 10:25.889
Whoa, buddy,
it's chillin'.

10:25.889 --> 10:28.897
It's not like
chillin', chillin'.

10:28.897 --> 10:32.906
Bro, it is chillin' !
I know.
It's cold !

10:32.906 --> 10:37.417
It's so, uh --
help me.

10:37.918 --> 10:39.423
Check it, buddy.

10:39.423 --> 10:41.628
Oh, buddy !

10:41.628 --> 10:45.437
Dude, I know
what this is, bro.
What is it ?

10:45.437 --> 10:48.945
It's a
mousterian bowl.
No way !

10:48.945 --> 10:51.952
Hey, come on, David.
Be careful with that.

10:51.952 --> 10:53.957
What's a mousterian bowl ?

10:53.957 --> 10:56.965
A mousterian bowl
from the mousterian era.

10:56.965 --> 11:00.974
"Prehistoric artifacts
for five hundred, Alex."

11:01.476 --> 11:04.983
Don't you ever
watch "jeopardy" ?

11:04.983 --> 11:10.497
Buddy, this is kind of like
prehistoric tupperware, bro.

11:10.497 --> 11:14.507
It's still preserved...
Like smuckers !

11:14.507 --> 11:17.514
Oooow !

11:17.514 --> 11:20.521
Earthquake !
Earthquake !

11:20.521 --> 11:23.027
Earthquake !

11:23.528 --> 11:25.534
Ahhhh !

11:25.534 --> 11:29.041
Oh !

11:29.543 --> 11:30.545
Oh God !
Oh God !

11:45.080 --> 11:47.837
Nice save, Davage.

11:58.613 --> 12:01.620
Stone ?
Yeah.

12:01.620 --> 12:05.128
There's a guy
buried in my pool.

12:08.135 --> 12:11.142
Hello, Fred.
I'm glad I caught you.

12:11.142 --> 12:13.650
Are you available
for a meeting
sometime this week ?

12:14.150 --> 12:16.656
Ms. Morgan,
open the door !
Mom !

12:16.656 --> 12:21.668
Mom, there's a guy
buried in our pool !

12:21.668 --> 12:24.174
Mom ! Mom !
Open the door !

12:24.676 --> 12:26.179
I'm working !

12:26.681 --> 12:30.690
Call 9-1-1 !
Call 9-1-1 !

12:38.208 --> 12:40.715
They never found
Jim morrison.

12:40.715 --> 12:43.722
Yeah, or Jimmy hoffa.

12:43.722 --> 12:47.731
Or Jimmy Mahoney.

12:47.731 --> 12:50.237
He was a kid I knew
in cub scouts.

12:50.237 --> 12:52.242
Come on,
let's go.

12:52.242 --> 12:54.748
They never
found him.

13:00.261 --> 13:02.768
David, I know
what this is.
What ?

13:02.768 --> 13:06.275
It's a caveman.
Would you please !

13:06.275 --> 13:09.283
No, I'm serious.

13:11.288 --> 13:13.794
No way !

13:14.295 --> 13:17.301
Whoa.
A caveman !

13:17.803 --> 13:22.816
This is unbelievable !
Do you know what
this could mean for us ?

13:22.816 --> 13:25.823
This could mean --
this could mean fame
or money !

13:25.823 --> 13:27.828
Or popularity !

13:27.828 --> 13:30.333
Far too much
responsibility for me.

13:30.333 --> 13:32.840
Anyways,
I'm already popular.

13:32.840 --> 13:36.347
Yeah, you travel
in large groups
of one, stoney.

13:36.849 --> 13:39.857
Besides, this is
my one chance to make
somethin' out of myself.

13:39.857 --> 13:43.364
You gotta help me dig
him out. You were here.
You're part of it.

13:43.364 --> 13:48.879
I don't wanna be part
of anything, Dave.
I'm happy just to be me.

13:48.879 --> 13:51.885
It could mean money.

13:51.885 --> 13:57.399
You tellin' me you
couldn't use a,
a new scooter ?

13:57.399 --> 13:59.905
Some new Bell-bottoms ?

14:00.406 --> 14:02.912
A little fun-dage ?

14:03.412 --> 14:07.423
Wease some older nugs
with a mansion and a pool ?

14:07.423 --> 14:10.430
Soakin' up the rays,

14:10.931 --> 14:14.439
watchin' all the
"jeop-ardy" you can handle ?

14:14.439 --> 14:17.948
That was the clincher.
Everybody's got a price.
Come on, man.

14:29.977 --> 14:33.987
Steady it !
Give it more gas,
more gas !

14:33.987 --> 14:36.493
Perfect ! Hold !

14:38.497 --> 14:40.502
This thing
weighs a ton.

15:00.550 --> 15:04.059
Ahh !

15:09.572 --> 15:13.582
Hey, there's his pits,
bro.

15:16.088 --> 15:19.095
That's his head.

15:19.095 --> 15:21.101
That's his skull.

15:33.630 --> 15:36.637
Get off me !

15:36.637 --> 15:40.146
What are you
doin' ?
I don't like mornings.

15:40.647 --> 15:43.153
Ow ! Come on,
let's get up.

15:44.156 --> 15:46.661
He's still in here.

15:47.663 --> 15:50.671
No kidding, Dave.
He's an ice cube.

15:50.671 --> 15:54.680
We gotta
thaw him out.
Okay.

15:56.585 --> 15:58.391
This has gotta be
our secret, okay ?

15:58.391 --> 16:00.997
You can't tell anybody...
Nobody !

16:01.098 --> 16:03.604
Can I tell
Steve Kooser ?
No one !

16:03.604 --> 16:07.211
All right ? Nobody !
You understand ?
Yeah, zip...

16:07.211 --> 16:09.035
- Thank you.
- Dee-do-dah.

16:26.660 --> 16:28.767
- Well it's kind of nice.
- Yeah, you're really swell today.

16:28.867 --> 16:31.373
- Hi, Robyn.
- Hi, Dave.

16:31.875 --> 16:34.700
- Guess what I found ?
- A life ?

16:34.884 --> 16:38.044
No. Come here.
Guess what I found ?

16:38.079 --> 16:40.482
- I don't know.
- Guess ? Guess ?
- I have no idea.

16:40.517 --> 16:43.470
I found a caveman.
A caveman ?

16:43.505 --> 16:46.635
Shh. Yeah.
Oh Dave,
you're drowning.

16:46.916 --> 16:49.690
It's cool, right ?
I found a caveman.

16:49.725 --> 16:51.849
All by myself.
I dug him out
of my backyard.

16:51.930 --> 16:55.522
You wanna come check him out
after school ?
Well, uh --

16:55.557 --> 16:58.561
I'm only invitin'
a few people.
I got that
prom thing.

16:58.596 --> 17:01.066
Ten minutes...
Please ?

17:01.455 --> 17:05.922
Dave, I just don't think
I'm ready to handle a --

17:05.957 --> 17:07.507
a caveman.

17:07.541 --> 17:08.770
You're not ?

17:10.480 --> 17:11.986
All right.

17:12.484 --> 17:14.363
I understand.

17:15.492 --> 17:17.553
Bye, David.

17:19.505 --> 17:23.015
I love it when
she calls me David.

17:23.516 --> 17:27.025
Hello, David.
Agh.

17:27.025 --> 17:29.031
Goin' somewhere ?

17:29.031 --> 17:32.040
Yeah, I got a date
with your mom.
That's not nice.

17:32.040 --> 17:35.048
It's a joke.
I'm sorry, just kidding.

17:59.112 --> 18:02.623
You've been a headache
ever since the third grade.
God !

18:02.623 --> 18:07.432
I know about your stupid
prom-king bullshit. Forget it.

18:07.467 --> 18:11.344
Robyn wouldn't piss
on your gums if your
teeth were on fire.

18:11.344 --> 18:13.852
Yes, she would.

18:14.351 --> 18:17.359
Shush ! Hush, please !

18:17.359 --> 18:19.867
Showin' your ignorance
again, Morgan.

18:19.867 --> 18:24.880
Some of us pump
and some of us slump.

18:25.381 --> 18:28.890
You should
try some pump, Morgan.
Might clear up your acne.

18:28.890 --> 18:32.398
You're so --
am I ?

18:34.403 --> 18:36.911
N-no, stop.

18:36.911 --> 18:38.915
Stop it !

18:38.915 --> 18:40.921
Why do you
make me do this ?

18:41.421 --> 18:44.428
What are you writing ?
Hey, what did you write ?

18:45.932 --> 18:47.939
Matt, not the
fire alarm !

18:47.939 --> 18:49.945
Matt ! Matt !

18:49.945 --> 18:54.956
God, help !
Oh God !

18:55.959 --> 18:58.466
Hey, come here.
Oh, ta-ha-ha.

21:53.915 --> 21:55.919
Hmm.

22:38.529 --> 22:41.035

I can't believe it.
He's alive !

24:42.347 --> 24:44.854
He was practically
an ice cube...
Practically.

24:44.854 --> 24:47.360
I say
we just walk.
No, no way !

24:47.360 --> 24:51.872
Oh, please.
He is ours.
We found him.

24:53.375 --> 24:55.882
What ?
Be hospitable ?

25:02.398 --> 25:05.406
- Ooh !
- Ahh ! Ahh !

25:05.406 --> 25:10.419
How ya doin' ?
Hi, my name is Dave.

25:12.926 --> 25:15.433
Come here, come here.
Introduce yourself.

25:15.433 --> 25:19.943
This is stoney.
Stoney, he's my friend.

25:19.943 --> 25:21.949
Uh, this is my room.

25:23.452 --> 25:25.959
It's okay.
It's okay.

25:27.462 --> 25:30.973
Uh, we're
from Encino.

25:30.973 --> 25:33.478
It's a pleasure
to make your acquaintance.

25:33.478 --> 25:35.484
And we hope you don't
gnaw on our beaks.
Shh.

25:35.484 --> 25:38.992
I know what
I'm doing, stone.

25:42.000 --> 25:46.512
We go to high school.
High school ?

25:46.512 --> 25:48.517
He doesn't know
what high school is.

25:48.517 --> 25:50.521
He doesn't know
what anything is.

25:50.521 --> 25:53.029
Just be
calm and easy.

25:53.029 --> 25:58.543
Calm...
And easy.
Hey, hi.

26:08.568 --> 26:12.078
- Get the phone.
- Okay. Okay.

26:27.116 --> 26:29.623
It's okay.
It's okay.

26:29.623 --> 26:31.627
See, I think
he's calming down.

26:31.627 --> 26:35.137
Calming... down.

26:44.661 --> 26:46.665
Ugh ?

26:47.669 --> 26:52.181
Fire.
Flameage.

26:52.681 --> 26:55.187
Buddy's into it.
That was kill,
stone.

26:55.187 --> 26:59.199
Look at his eyes.
He likes the blue part.

26:59.199 --> 27:02.707
He's glossy-eyed.
Look, freak
him out. Ow !

27:02.707 --> 27:04.211
Ow ! Ooh !

27:06.217 --> 27:09.225
- Ugh !
- Okay. Ah, ah !

27:12.733 --> 27:15.240
Give it to him.
No !

27:15.240 --> 27:17.245
Ugh. Ugh.

27:17.245 --> 27:21.255
- Here, here. Look, here.
-You gotta teach him.

27:21.756 --> 27:23.761
Whoa ! Oh.

27:35.291 --> 27:36.294
Hey !

27:36.294 --> 27:39.301
No.
No.

27:39.301 --> 27:41.306
What ?
Did you just --

27:41.306 --> 27:44.814
- I think he just said "no."
- No !

27:44.814 --> 27:47.823
- No ?
- No ! No !

27:47.823 --> 27:50.329
No. No.

27:50.329 --> 27:53.085
Cool, buddy.
He is so greasy !

27:54.143 --> 27:58.154
Greasy ? He's a
prehistoric pyromaniac.

27:58.154 --> 28:01.162
- We gotta teach him stuff.
- We'll teach him how to wease.

28:01.162 --> 28:04.673
No. No.

28:04.673 --> 28:08.183
No !
No ! No !

28:08.183 --> 28:11.693
Oh God. We gotta teach him
how to be normal.

28:11.693 --> 28:14.702
No, uh-uh. We're goin' psycho
with him, bro.

28:14.702 --> 28:16.708
That's boring, dude,
normal !

28:16.708 --> 28:19.214
Stoney, come on, man.
Hang with me.

28:19.716 --> 28:21.221
We gotta play
this thing out.

28:21.723 --> 28:25.232
If we tell anyone,
if anyone sees him, they'll
take him away from us.

28:25.734 --> 28:27.238
They'll cut him up
into little pieces.

28:27.739 --> 28:30.747
They'll take all the credit,
and we'll still be geeks.

28:30.747 --> 28:35.262
I'm not a geek.
I'm a unique weasel, David.

28:35.262 --> 28:38.270
I'm just underrated 'cause
I live here in Encino.

28:41.780 --> 28:44.288

Let's show him
himself.
Okay.

30:14.047 --> 30:16.555
You wanna see your mug, bud ?
Check it.

30:16.555 --> 30:18.261
Ugh !

30:18.261 --> 30:21.068

30:24.579 --> 30:30.094

say "ba...Uff" ?

30:30.595 --> 30:35.610
Ba...Uff ?

30:35.610 --> 30:39.622
I like that.
You know,
you pause too.

30:42.127 --> 30:44.135
We gotta give him
a cool name.

30:44.135 --> 30:46.141
Axl.
Yeah, buddy.

30:46.642 --> 30:49.149
Not axl.
This is serious.
Okay.

30:49.149 --> 30:51.657
We've got the missing link
standing in my bedroom.

30:54.666 --> 30:58.677
Link ! Link !
We'll call him link !

30:58.677 --> 31:02.188
Okay, cool.
Maybe we could call him
stoney number two...

31:02.188 --> 31:04.193
Because he's got
my same 'do...

31:04.695 --> 31:07.201
And he's from
the stone age.

31:07.201 --> 31:10.712
I like link better.
Okay, we'll
call him link.

31:10.712 --> 31:12.717
But can I
call him linkage ?
Cool !

31:13.219 --> 31:16.729
Cool !
Let's see how
smart he is.

31:19.236 --> 31:20.741
No, no.
Come here.

31:21.242 --> 31:24.752
Okay. Okay.
You okay ?
Uh.

31:24.752 --> 31:27.259
Uh, uh, look.

31:29.266 --> 31:33.277
See ?
Ugh.
Ahh ?

31:33.779 --> 31:36.285
Whoa !
Ahh !

31:50.327 --> 31:53.335
You're link.
I'm Dave. Dave !

31:53.335 --> 31:55.340
Dave. Dave.

31:55.340 --> 31:58.852
No, Dave, Dave.
Dave, Dave, Dave.

31:59.353 --> 32:01.358
Dave.
Yes !

32:01.859 --> 32:04.366
Okay,
and that's --

32:04.366 --> 32:07.374
that's stoney.
Mm-hmm.

32:07.374 --> 32:10.384

32:10.384 --> 32:13.392
No, no.
Stoney.
Stoney.

32:13.894 --> 32:16.401
Yes !
Ahh !

32:16.401 --> 32:21.417
Okay, okay.
And now you are ?

32:21.918 --> 32:23.924
Dave !
Ahh !

32:23.924 --> 32:27.435
No, no, I'm Dave.
You are ?

32:33.451 --> 32:35.456
Buff.

32:35.456 --> 32:39.469
No.

32:39.469 --> 32:42.979
It's all right.
You've had a hard day.

32:42.979 --> 32:45.486
- Your parents !
- My parents !

32:47.492 --> 32:51.003
Okay, uh, uh,
take him out back and ring
the doorbell three times.

32:51.003 --> 32:53.508
But, Dave --
no "buts,"
just do it !

32:53.508 --> 32:58.524
Follow the weasel,
linkage, come on.
Quick, quick, quick.

33:03.037 --> 33:06.046
My kitchen !

33:08.051 --> 33:10.559
Busted !

33:10.559 --> 33:14.069
What are you doing ?

33:14.069 --> 33:17.579
What are you doing ?
I'm cooking dinner.

33:17.579 --> 33:19.584
You're what ?
Busted !

33:19.584 --> 33:22.593
I'm cooking dinner.
I thought it might be
a nice surprise.

33:22.593 --> 33:24.599
They're surprised,
all right.

33:27.107 --> 33:29.112
What is
going on here ?

33:29.112 --> 33:31.118
Where's the flour ?
I can't find the flour.

33:31.619 --> 33:35.631
Hello, Stanley.
Who is this strange boy and
why is he ringing my doorbell ?

33:35.631 --> 33:40.646
It got stuck, sir.
Come in.
Meet your new family.

33:40.646 --> 33:43.655
Whose family ?

33:43.655 --> 33:46.664
Boris, get down !
Boris !

33:46.664 --> 33:50.675
- Boris, get out !
- Get down !

33:50.675 --> 33:54.185
-- Get out, get out !

33:55.689 --> 33:57.695
Hey, dad.

33:57.695 --> 33:59.701
David,
who is that ?
Huh ?

34:00.202 --> 34:01.707
That ?
Who's that ?

34:01.707 --> 34:06.220
- That was Linkavitch Chomofsky.
- What ?

34:06.220 --> 34:10.231
Link... Linkav--
doesn't anybody in this house
listen to anything I say ?

34:10.734 --> 34:12.739
What is he
talking about ?

34:12.739 --> 34:14.745
Dad, Linkavitch
Chomofsky.

34:14.745 --> 34:17.753
Our exchange student ?
He's here.

34:18.255 --> 34:20.261
He's gonna help us
dig the pool.

34:21.264 --> 34:22.869
Yeah !

34:23.069 --> 34:25.576
Why does none of this
sound familiar to me ?

34:25.576 --> 34:28.083
I told you about this
months ago, remember ?

34:28.083 --> 34:32.599
About school giving us
extra credit for college
for housing exchange students,

34:33.100 --> 34:36.108
and learning about
their culture and
you said it was okay.

34:36.108 --> 34:38.616
Now you're gonna
take it back ?

34:38.616 --> 34:40.621
No, no, no, I'm not
gonna take it back.

34:40.621 --> 34:43.128
This is important to me.
This is my life.

34:43.128 --> 34:46.638
It's embarrassing.
He travelled here
all the way from --

34:46.638 --> 34:50.652
- I don't know, Estonia ?
- Yeah, Estonia !

34:50.652 --> 34:53.157
Mom, come on.
You're not buying this ?

34:53.157 --> 34:55.164
Well, I --
dad ?

34:55.164 --> 34:59.175
Actually, I, I,
I think now...

34:59.175 --> 35:02.687
That I, I, I do
recall something.

35:02.789 --> 35:05.295
- See ?
- See, it's about focusing.

35:05.797 --> 35:10.310
You're bogus.
Larry, how could I forget
something like this ?

35:10.310 --> 35:13.821
He's an exchange student.
He's going to be staying
in our house.

35:13.821 --> 35:15.828
You forgot me
in the third grade.

35:15.828 --> 35:18.073
I spent the entire night after
the play in the parking lot.

35:18.086 --> 35:20.342
In the sixth grade,
the soccer ?

35:20.342 --> 35:24.355
Okay, where's
he gonna stay ?

35:24.355 --> 35:26.864
And why is he
attacking the dog ?

35:26.864 --> 35:31.376
He's gonna stay in my room.
He's not attacking the dog.
He's bonding.

35:31.376 --> 35:33.382
- As if !
- Shut up !

35:33.382 --> 35:35.891
- You shut up.
- No, everybody shut up.

35:35.891 --> 35:39.402
Larry, it's okay.
I'm tired.
I'm a little hungry.

35:39.402 --> 35:42.410
It's time we decide
what we're gonna make
for dinner.

35:42.912 --> 35:45.420
I assume you'll
be joining us ?
You assume correctly, Mr. M.

35:45.420 --> 35:49.933
We practically feed the
entire neighborhood. Why not
part of Estonia as well, huh ?

35:49.933 --> 35:51.940
I always eat here
and I like your food.

35:52.440 --> 35:55.451
Great.

35:55.451 --> 35:57.959
Stop it ! No.

35:58.459 --> 36:02.472
No, no, no.

36:02.472 --> 36:07.488
I can't believe you told
my parents he's from Estonia.

36:07.488 --> 36:10.998
Cow pajamas ?
Those are kind of flaming.

36:10.998 --> 36:14.008
Ooh !

36:14.510 --> 36:18.521
Some Betty, huh ?
Betty.

36:21.530 --> 36:24.039

36:24.039 --> 36:28.552
Gonzangas ?
Buddy, cones.

36:30.057 --> 36:33.568
I know you've had
a big day, pal.
But tomorrow...

36:33.568 --> 36:36.076
I'm gonna take you
someplace really special.

36:36.577 --> 36:40.087
Taco Bell.
Better.
Get the camera.

Oh God,
he doesn't like that.

37:11.188 --> 37:13.197
That's glass.
That hurts your beak.

37:13.197 --> 37:15.200
Stand up straight.

37:16.205 --> 37:18.211
Poor stone-ager.

37:18.211 --> 37:20.219
He spent a million years
chillin' in a block of ice,

37:20.219 --> 37:23.229
now he's gotta go
to high school ! Agh !

37:23.229 --> 37:25.235
Who's that guy with
the dork squad ?

37:25.235 --> 37:28.748
- Oh my God, he is totally rude.
- Totally.

37:30.253 --> 37:33.262
We have got a
major find here.

37:33.262 --> 37:35.269
This guy's our ticket
to fame and popularity.

37:35.770 --> 37:39.282
All we gotta do is get him
enrolled in school and he'll
help us become popular.

37:39.282 --> 37:43.298
That's harsh.
We'll make him famous.

37:43.298 --> 37:46.309
We'll teach him some
stupid pet tricks and
get him on letterman.

37:46.809 --> 37:48.815
You're weasin' off
his gig.

37:49.319 --> 37:51.323
Oh please !
He's a caveman,
for God sakes.

37:51.824 --> 37:54.835
Look at him.
He's practically
a monkey.

37:56.843 --> 37:59.853
We found him.
We can do whatever
we want with him.

37:59.853 --> 38:02.364
We, we, we? No, no, no.
You, you, you.

38:02.364 --> 38:04.871
I just wanna be
his friend.

38:04.871 --> 38:06.876
Fine.

38:06.876 --> 38:09.886
Hello, Mrs. Mackey.

38:11.392 --> 38:14.403
And what do we
have here ?

38:16.912 --> 38:18.918
Now I'm covered
up to fourth period.

38:19.421 --> 38:22.931
I don't know what to do
with him after that.
I can take him to Spanish.

38:22.931 --> 38:24.939
Will you be careful ?
I'll be cool, man.
I promise.

38:24.939 --> 38:27.447
Okay.

38:27.447 --> 38:29.454
What's he doin' ?

38:29.454 --> 38:32.466
I don't know.

38:32.466 --> 38:34.973

39:01.061 --> 39:04.072
Whoa.

39:04.072 --> 39:06.581

39:07.585 --> 39:10.594
Is this dude
totally fundamental
or what ?

39:10.594 --> 39:13.104
Did you miss me ?
Always.

39:13.104 --> 39:15.611
Who is this ?
This is
my friend, link.

39:15.611 --> 39:19.122
Link.
He's staying with us.
He's from Estonia.

39:19.122 --> 39:22.637
You're kidding ?
This guy is staying with you ?

39:22.637 --> 39:24.643
Uh-huh.

39:26.148 --> 39:28.657
He's thinkin' of
becoming a hairdresser.

39:28.657 --> 39:31.668
Designing crusty mops
for the rich and famous.

39:31.668 --> 39:33.171
Oh.

39:33.171 --> 39:36.183
Ugh. Gonzangas.

39:36.183 --> 39:38.691
No !
Bye, Robyn.
Hey, hey, hey.

39:39.192 --> 39:41.701
I think he was saying
he likes your cones.

39:41.701 --> 39:45.211
I'm thrilled.
Get out of my face !

39:45.211 --> 39:47.219
Robyn,
that import is mine.

39:47.219 --> 39:49.729
This is just
in time for prom.
Yeah ?

39:50.230 --> 39:52.740
Is he fine
or what ?
I'm not sure.

40:03.775 --> 40:09.295
He's a looker !
Link. Link !

40:09.295 --> 40:11.804
Link, please,

40:11.804 --> 40:15.314
Who is this dipshit,
anyway ?

40:15.314 --> 40:17.323
His name's link.

40:17.323 --> 40:20.333
He's from Estonia and
I think he's jive.

40:20.333 --> 40:23.846
Jive, yeah.
You do ?

40:23.846 --> 40:26.856
Hell yeah,
and I'm not the only one.

40:27.356 --> 40:29.363
Hey, link !

40:34.882 --> 40:37.390
I'll see you
next period.

40:37.390 --> 40:39.898
Watch him.
All right, David.

40:39.898 --> 40:43.914
We got Spanish now.
Spanish is like guacamole,
chips and salsa.

40:43.914 --> 40:47.928
LA d?A es mi
en hermanos.

40:47.928 --> 40:50.435
The day is beautiful.

40:50.936 --> 40:54.447
The sun isn't shining
all through the night.

41:05.988 --> 41:09.499
Link, come on.
Sorry, you guys.

41:09.499 --> 41:12.511
Whoa !

41:15.521 --> 41:17.890
Vale, repitan en espanol.

41:18.532 --> 41:21.040
The cheese is
old and moldy.

41:21.040 --> 41:25.055
El queso est?
Viejo y podrido.

41:25.055 --> 41:27.063
Where is the bathroom ?

You're cute.

41:40.611 --> 41:43.623
Meet me
at blades tonight.

41:43.623 --> 41:46.634
Blades tonight.

41:49.141 --> 41:53.659
Yes, what ?
You can drop him off in front
of blades tonight, right ?

41:53.659 --> 41:56.669
Can David and I
go too, please ?

41:56.669 --> 41:59.178
You smell.

41:59.178 --> 42:02.692
Hey, seniorita.
That hurt my lobes.

42:02.692 --> 42:05.702
I didn't do it. They
started the whole thing.

42:11.724 --> 42:14.232
Kashmir ?
Rajneesh, is it ?

42:14.232 --> 42:16.742
- How many minutes for the burrito ?
- Two minutes.

42:16.742 --> 42:20.254
One minute.
Two minutes !

42:20.756 --> 42:23.768
Ah, make up
your melons !

42:23.768 --> 42:26.777
- Is it one or two ?
- One and a half minutes.

42:27.278 --> 42:28.786
Okay.

42:28.786 --> 42:32.375
Okay, my friend.
Try and experience...

42:32.410 --> 42:35.108
What I'm about to chirp
in your lobes, cool ?
Hey.

42:35.611 --> 42:37.617
We're going
to discuss grindage;

42:38.118 --> 42:42.636
how to fill the furnace,
pack the cheeks and
stuff the gills. Okay ?

42:42.636 --> 42:45.646
You're used to
eating twigs, right ?

42:45.646 --> 42:48.159
But here in the U.S. of a-age
we got something called...

42:48.159 --> 42:52.672
The four basic food groups,
and this is not one of 'em.

42:52.672 --> 42:54.179
Oh.

42:54.081 --> 42:56.087
Look at what
we have here.

42:56.087 --> 42:58.598
Dairy group.
Dairy group.

42:58.598 --> 43:02.613
Milk duds. Hide these
under your pillow so
your mom doesn't find them.

43:02.613 --> 43:04.619
If she does,
you're tweaked, buddy.

43:04.619 --> 43:06.629
Keep on cruisin'.

43:06.629 --> 43:09.138
Fruit group.
Sweet tarts.

43:09.138 --> 43:13.155
These are killer.
So citrusy, dude,
you'll freak.

43:13.155 --> 43:15.162
Keep on cruisin'.
Uh-huh.

43:15.663 --> 43:20.006
Right, this is
the vegetable group.

43:20.041 --> 43:22.989
Corn nuts ! Put 'em
on a pedestal, bro.

43:23.024 --> 43:25.438

- Two minutes.

43:51.354 --> 43:53.878

'cause you're a caveman.

43:54.315 --> 43:55.862
Cool, buddy.

43:55.897 --> 43:58.831

this place on the map.

44:01.842 --> 44:04.855
What are you doing,
Mr. stoney ? No, no !

44:04.855 --> 44:08.367
- You can't do this here.
- You must leave now, please.

44:08.367 --> 44:12.685
-Look, kashmir, rajneesh, chill.

46:38.734 --> 46:40.742

You know, Mr. M.,
the way I look at it,
some day...

47:14.871 --> 47:17.381
Your daughter and I
could be married...

47:17.381 --> 47:21.897
And we could
be related.
I count the days.

47:28.924 --> 47:33.441
So, Stanley,
how's your mother ?

47:33.441 --> 47:36.452
She's really bummed.
Can you pass the peas ?

47:36.452 --> 47:39.463

never work out.

52:11.270 --> 52:13.778
Wease some juice !

52:13.778 --> 52:17.794
Hey, you want
a piece of me ?

52:22.314 --> 52:26.334
Oh God !

52:27.338 --> 52:29.346
I don't know you.

52:29.346 --> 52:31.856
I don't like you.

52:31.856 --> 52:35.872
As of now,
I'm all over you.

52:49.934 --> 52:53.450
Did you see that ?
The new kid,
he took it.

52:53.450 --> 52:55.457
Whoa !
Whoa !

52:55.457 --> 52:59.979
Don't just stand there.
Do something.
Stand up for yourself.

52:59.979 --> 53:01.986
Hit him back !

53:01.986 --> 53:03.994
Link, hit him back !
Where you goin' ?

53:03.994 --> 53:07.009
What do you think of your
Bulgarian dork bud, now ?

53:07.009 --> 53:09.020
Hmm ?

53:09.020 --> 53:13.537
That was harsh,
Matt.

53:14.541 --> 53:16.549
Let's get
out of here.

53:16.549 --> 53:20.065
The stench of losers is
doing damage to my sinuses.

53:20.065 --> 53:23.581
Just stop it, Matt.
Don't even come near me.

53:24.083 --> 53:25.588
Hey, watch it.

53:26.090 --> 53:30.109
Why don't you take this,
'cause I don't think
I need it anymore.

53:30.109 --> 53:31.615
Hey !

53:32.117 --> 53:35.292
I can't believe
he got nailed.
He's a pacifist.

53:35.635 --> 53:39.152
A pacifist caveman !
You're mental.

53:39.152 --> 53:41.158
Cavemens aren't like us,
Dave.

53:41.158 --> 53:44.676
They fought for food and
survival. They did not
fight for popularity.

53:45.178 --> 53:48.193
What would he be
fighting for, huh ?
For face.

53:48.193 --> 53:51.710
For us !
To be cool !
Cool, huh ?

53:51.710 --> 53:53.715
He does not know
what cool is.

53:54.219 --> 53:57.234
He doesn't know where he is.
He knows nothin'.

53:58.237 --> 54:01.252
He's gotta learn
how to defend himself.

54:01.252 --> 54:05.771
Against what ?
Against butt holes
like Matt.

54:15.819 --> 54:17.827

Hello, little one.

56:26.569 --> 56:29.070
We took a vote and the computer club
feels your presence...

56:29.070 --> 56:31.072
Will be a valuable asset
to our organization.

Computer club.
Computer club.

56:41.184 --> 56:43.188
Why doesn't that happen
when Matt hits me ?

56:43.188 --> 56:46.690
Give yourself a
few million years, David.

56:58.707 --> 57:01.208
Link. Link.
Link, get down.

57:01.710 --> 57:03.214
All right,
come on.

57:03.713 --> 57:06.216
No, no.
I was just playin'.

57:06.716 --> 57:08.219
All right,
cro-magnon man.

57:08.219 --> 57:11.223
What you're looking at here
is a representation...

57:11.723 --> 57:14.228
Of what cro-magnon man's
everyday life
may have been like.

57:14.728 --> 57:18.733
If he was here today, you could
sit next to him, you would
never know the difference.

57:18.733 --> 57:23.239
Stoney, let's move on.
We're gonna look at
the giant sloth.

58:34.326 --> 58:37.834
Class, this is
saber-toothed cat.

58:37.834 --> 58:40.834
Even though he's
been extinct for
over 10,000 years,

58:40.834 --> 58:43.339
while he was alive
you can imagine that
many a caveman...

58:43.839 --> 58:46.345
Was a tasty meal
to one of these.

58:48.345 --> 58:50.348
There's one now.
Uh-oh.

58:50.348 --> 58:54.354
Let's look at
the mammoth display,
our school mascot.

58:56.357 --> 58:59.361
Look out !
Whoa.

59:18.884 --> 59:21.388
Link ! Link,
get out from there !

59:21.388 --> 59:23.392
Look at him.
He's flipping out.

59:23.392 --> 59:25.393
He knows, Dave.
What ?

59:25.893 --> 59:28.896
He knows.

59:28.896 --> 59:31.899
He knows what
happened to him.

59:31.899 --> 59:36.406
We have
to help him.

59:36.406 --> 59:38.913
Link.

59:40.412 --> 59:42.414
Link. Link.

59:42.414 --> 59:44.918
Ow !

59:45.918 --> 59:47.923
Link.

59:47.923 --> 59:51.929
Hey. Hey,
come on, man.
Stop it.

59:51.929 --> 59:53.929
Look, I understand.

59:54.929 --> 59:57.434
Family.

59:58.932 --> 01:00:00.937
Family.

01:00:03.943 --> 01:00:05.946
Family.
You okay ?

01:00:05.946 --> 01:00:08.448
It's okay.
We're your new family.

01:00:08.448 --> 01:00:10.948
We're your
new family.

01:00:11.450 --> 01:00:12.953
It's okay.

01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:22.465
It's all right.

01:00:25.468 --> 01:00:27.972
He's burnt
from all this.

01:00:27.972 --> 01:00:31.477
Seeing as we started
the school year
as total losers,

01:00:31.977 --> 01:00:33.979
and now everyone
knows who we are,

01:00:33.979 --> 01:00:36.486
I don't think one mistake
is such a big deal.

01:00:36.486 --> 01:00:39.988
But you're doggin' him.
Just promise me,

01:00:39.988 --> 01:00:42.990
just a little more mellow,
not so much ?

01:00:42.990 --> 01:00:46.496
Stoney !
Dave !

01:00:46.496 --> 01:00:48.498
All right.

01:00:48.498 --> 01:00:52.004
If it'll make you
feel better, I'll be
more mellow with him.

01:00:52.004 --> 01:00:54.507
Robyn sweeney ?
Here.

01:00:54.507 --> 01:00:59.515
Again ?
I'm sorry. I can't get
that parallel parking thing.

01:00:59.515 --> 01:01:03.518
Whoa. Parallel parking
is not a thing, understand ?

01:01:03.518 --> 01:01:07.523
It's not a feeling,
not a state of mind,
or one of your disco dances.

01:01:08.024 --> 01:01:11.026
Yeah.
Get in the car and
don't take it personally.

01:01:11.026 --> 01:01:13.028
Okay, Mr. beady.

01:01:13.028 --> 01:01:15.534
- Linkavitch Chomofsky ?
- Ugh, ugh.

01:01:15.534 --> 01:01:18.036
What are you
lookin' at ?

01:01:18.036 --> 01:01:19.538
Ugh.

01:01:19.538 --> 01:01:23.043
Get inside the car...

01:01:23.043 --> 01:01:26.048
And shoot
your barber.

01:01:26.048 --> 01:01:31.055
Contrast this
with Hemingway's
"the sun also rises,"

01:01:31.555 --> 01:01:33.055
where the blood sport
of bullfighting...

01:01:33.554 --> 01:01:36.559
Is used and
perhaps what --
uh-oh.

01:01:39.063 --> 01:01:41.566
Oh God.
Rad mobile !
Rad mobile !

01:01:42.066 --> 01:01:45.070
Boys, will you sit down ?
Class ?

01:01:45.070 --> 01:01:48.575
You promised me mellow.
This isn't mellow.

01:01:49.577 --> 01:01:52.579
Link ! Link !

01:01:54.082 --> 01:01:56.085
Dave.

01:01:56.586 --> 01:01:58.590
Watch the people !
Grab the wheel !

01:01:58.590 --> 01:02:01.088
Okay !

01:02:04.094 --> 01:02:07.099
Stone, tell him to stop !
Okay, stop.

01:02:07.099 --> 01:02:10.099
Didn't phase him, bro.
Oh shit !

01:02:10.099 --> 01:02:13.105
All right, link.
Joke's over. Stop !

01:02:13.105 --> 01:02:16.610
- He-e-e-ey !
- Stop that car, young man !

01:02:16.610 --> 01:02:20.115
I'm your teacher.
Both hands on the wheel !

01:02:24.119 --> 01:02:26.122
Who was that ?

01:02:26.122 --> 01:02:28.624
Crosswalk !
Crosswalk !

01:02:32.633 --> 01:02:34.634
Close call, buddy.

01:02:34.634 --> 01:02:37.135
Hey, buddy !

01:02:37.135 --> 01:02:40.138
Hi, Robyn.
Hi, Dave.

01:02:41.642 --> 01:02:44.148
Red light !
Red light !

01:02:51.657 --> 01:02:53.659
Boom !
Up on two wheels !

01:02:53.659 --> 01:02:56.662
I've never seen
anything like this.
I don't teach that.

01:02:56.662 --> 01:03:02.168
I got the license plate.
It's e684-257.

01:03:02.168 --> 01:03:05.170
You don't have to write
that I left the keys
in the ignition, do you ?

01:03:05.170 --> 01:03:07.674
Ow-o-o-o-o !

01:03:08.175 --> 01:03:10.678
I think he's got
the hang of it.

01:03:15.687 --> 01:03:21.193
That concludes our
parallel parking for today.
Class dismissed.

01:03:21.193 --> 01:03:25.198
Link, I think you
just failed driver's Ed.

01:03:25.198 --> 01:03:27.200

Come on.
We're gonna get busted !

01:09:21.152 --> 01:09:23.654
You are busted.
Get down, man.

01:09:32.667 --> 01:09:35.671
Stoney is the crustiest vato...

01:09:35.671 --> 01:09:38.673
I've ever witnessed.

01:09:38.673 --> 01:09:43.180
So don't hush his gig,
buddy.

01:09:43.678 --> 01:09:45.182
Ow-o-o-o !

01:09:52.189 --> 01:09:54.194
Eh, buddy !

01:09:54.194 --> 01:09:58.197
Bye, guys.
Drive safely.

01:09:58.698 --> 01:10:01.203
Nice element
you're hanging out with.

01:10:01.203 --> 01:10:04.705
Who are your friends
in the low-rider ?
None of your business.

01:10:04.705 --> 01:10:08.210
Go home.
Huh.

01:10:14.218 --> 01:10:17.223
What time do you want me
to pick you up tomorrow night ?

01:10:17.223 --> 01:10:20.726
It's the prom,
remember ?

01:10:20.726 --> 01:10:23.231
You are just like
everyone else.

01:10:23.231 --> 01:10:26.232
All you care about
is what people think.

01:10:26.232 --> 01:10:29.237
It's really pathetic.

01:10:29.237 --> 01:10:32.242
Hey, watch it.

01:10:32.242 --> 01:10:36.747
Matt, I'm not going
to the prom with you.

01:10:37.747 --> 01:10:41.753
I wanna go with somebody
who's really cool,

01:10:41.753 --> 01:10:45.261
who's not afraid of
being himself or having fun.

01:10:49.263 --> 01:10:51.267
Good night.

01:10:53.769 --> 01:10:56.271
Who's cooler than me ?

01:10:57.772 --> 01:11:01.778
Your phone call.
You got one.
Make it quick.

01:11:05.281 --> 01:11:07.288
Thanks.

01:11:11.292 --> 01:11:13.794
Matthew Wilson !

01:11:14.292 --> 01:11:16.297
Hello.

01:11:16.297 --> 01:11:18.300
Robyn ?
Robyn.

01:11:18.300 --> 01:11:20.303
Dave, did you guys
get away okay ?

01:11:20.803 --> 01:11:22.806
We're in prison.

01:11:22.806 --> 01:11:26.810
Look, this is
my one phone call.

01:11:26.810 --> 01:11:29.815
I'm using it to ask you
to go to the prom with me.

01:11:30.314 --> 01:11:31.816
Just say yes,
okay ?

01:11:32.316 --> 01:11:34.321
No.

01:11:34.321 --> 01:11:39.327
Why not ?
I wanna go
with link.

01:11:39.327 --> 01:11:42.330
What ?
Will you ask link
if he'll go with me ?

01:11:42.832 --> 01:11:44.333
You want me to what ?

01:11:44.832 --> 01:11:48.338
Look, I'm sorry.
I'll tell you what.

01:11:48.338 --> 01:11:50.843
We'll all go.
We'll have a great time.

01:11:50.843 --> 01:11:53.845
How about that ?

01:11:53.845 --> 01:11:55.848
Dave ?

01:12:42.909 --> 01:12:44.910
Hey !

01:12:44.910 --> 01:12:47.416
¿¿ C?Mo est? Usted ?
Muy bonita...

01:12:47.416 --> 01:12:49.414
Es LA d?A.

01:12:49.414 --> 01:12:52.418
Hey, wait.
How was jail ?

01:12:52.418 --> 01:12:54.423
Did you meet anyone ?

01:12:54.423 --> 01:12:58.427
Hey, wait !
Wait up.

01:13:22.459 --> 01:13:26.465
Things just didn't
turn out right.
Ugh.

01:13:26.465 --> 01:13:30.470
I mean, I don't
want 'em cuttin' you up
into little pieces.

01:13:30.470 --> 01:13:33.471
This is just what's
best for you.

01:13:33.471 --> 01:13:35.476
It's best for me too,
all right ?

01:13:35.476 --> 01:13:37.477
Here.

01:13:40.981 --> 01:13:43.485
For rad mobile.

01:13:43.986 --> 01:13:45.488
For rad mobile.
Yeah.

01:13:45.987 --> 01:13:47.988
Put 'em
in your pocket.

01:13:52.495 --> 01:13:54.499
Don't look at me
like that.

01:13:54.499 --> 01:13:58.004
This is just the way
it's gotta be.

01:13:58.004 --> 01:14:00.507
Go on,
get out of here.

01:14:00.507 --> 01:14:04.512
Go on.

01:14:04.512 --> 01:14:08.518
Go on, leave.

01:14:08.518 --> 01:14:11.019
Go.

01:14:15.025 --> 01:14:17.027
I'm sorry.

01:14:19.530 --> 01:14:22.536
Hey, hey, hey !

01:14:22.536 --> 01:14:26.035
Talk to me, David.
Let me know what's
going on, man.

01:14:26.035 --> 01:14:29.544
What are you doin' ?
I'm letting him go.

01:14:29.544 --> 01:14:33.047
What ?
I can't handle him
anymore.

01:14:33.047 --> 01:14:36.556
He'll be better off
with somebody else.
No, he's not !

01:14:36.556 --> 01:14:38.555
Listen to me.
Call him back.

01:14:38.555 --> 01:14:41.560
I can't take it anymore.
I'm not kiddin'.
Call him back.

01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:43.309
It's time.
I'm serious.

01:14:43.309 --> 01:14:45.566
Call him back.
That's harsh.

01:14:45.566 --> 01:14:47.568
He's not
my responsibility.

01:14:47.568 --> 01:14:50.069
You're the one who weased
off his gig the whole time...

01:14:50.069 --> 01:14:53.073
'Cause you thought maybe
he'd get you somewhere.

01:14:53.073 --> 01:14:56.078
Now the guy gets a little crusty
and you're gonna bag him.

01:14:56.078 --> 01:15:01.084
It's not happenin', Dave.
That's not how it works
with friends, man.

01:15:01.084 --> 01:15:04.587
You don't bag your friends
'cause they get in the way,
no matter what, dude.

01:15:04.587 --> 01:15:08.593
Like you care ? The only thing
you've cared about is nugs,
chillin' and grindage.

01:15:08.593 --> 01:15:12.095
I happen to care
right now.
That's convenient.

01:15:12.095 --> 01:15:15.102
You came along for
the ride and let me
do the dirty work...

01:15:15.603 --> 01:15:17.605
'Cause you thought it might
work to your advantage.

01:15:17.605 --> 01:15:21.108
Those are desperate words
of a loser.

01:15:21.108 --> 01:15:24.616
Maybe Matt Wilson was right
about you all along.
Take that back.

01:15:24.616 --> 01:15:26.614
No, you take it back.
Take it back !

01:15:34.626 --> 01:15:36.629
You're a loser.

01:15:39.132 --> 01:15:41.636
- Family !
- All right.

01:15:44.638 --> 01:15:48.644
I'm sorry.
Family.

01:15:51.649 --> 01:15:54.149
You can let go,
link.

01:15:56.654 --> 01:16:00.159
I'm sorry, man.
It's okay.

01:16:00.159 --> 01:16:02.660
I don't know
what got into me.

01:16:02.660 --> 01:16:04.665
I'm sorry.

01:16:04.665 --> 01:16:08.170
I didn't mean it,
stoney.

01:16:09.169 --> 01:16:11.675
I'm sorry, bud.

01:16:14.677 --> 01:16:16.680
Ow !

01:16:26.192 --> 01:16:28.694
You look great.

01:16:28.694 --> 01:16:31.199
Have a good time.
You deserve it.

01:16:34.700 --> 01:16:39.208
If you touch her ?
Ugh.

01:16:39.208 --> 01:16:41.711
You think
they're ready ?
I don't know.

01:16:42.212 --> 01:16:43.714
Dave ?

01:16:44.215 --> 01:16:45.716
Dave, hey.

01:16:46.214 --> 01:16:48.221
Hey.

01:16:48.221 --> 01:16:50.723
You're not ready.

01:16:50.723 --> 01:16:52.725
I, I can't go.

01:16:52.725 --> 01:16:57.230
Of course you can.
Just go upstairs,
put something on.

01:16:57.230 --> 01:17:00.737
No, really, I can't.
I'm on probation.

01:17:00.737 --> 01:17:02.738
I'm grounded.

01:17:04.741 --> 01:17:07.744
Hi, link.
You look great.
Hi.

01:17:07.744 --> 01:17:10.748
You guys go.
Have a good time.
Go on.

01:17:10.748 --> 01:17:13.250
No, no, no.
Come on.
Come on, Dave.

01:17:13.250 --> 01:17:15.255
Go.
Are you sure ?

01:17:15.255 --> 01:17:17.257
Go, have a good time.
Go, link.

01:17:17.257 --> 01:17:20.259
Get outta here.
Have a good time.

01:17:20.259 --> 01:17:23.264
Drive safely.

01:17:23.264 --> 01:17:26.265
God, she smells good.

01:17:29.273 --> 01:17:31.774
To Link.

01:17:31.774 --> 01:17:34.778
May he have a cool time
at the prom.

01:17:34.778 --> 01:17:37.279
Totally, bro,
to linkage.

01:17:40.285 --> 01:17:44.291
There's always college.

01:17:44.794 --> 01:17:47.295
Junior college.

01:17:51.300 --> 01:17:54.303
Link, get down here.

01:17:56.305 --> 01:17:58.309
Give me a boost.

01:18:37.858 --> 01:18:39.863
Whoa.

01:18:48.870 --> 01:18:50.878
Gotcha.

01:18:52.879 --> 01:18:55.881
Dave !
Stoney, come on !

01:18:57.380 --> 01:18:59.889
Hey, what are

01:18:59.889 --> 01:19:02.389
Give me back
those pictures.

01:19:02.389 --> 01:19:04.394
No !

01:19:04.394 --> 01:19:07.898
Hey, get back here !
They took the polaroids.
Uh-oh.

01:19:07.898 --> 01:19:11.902
Come on.
Those are

01:19:24.918 --> 01:19:27.922

01:19:31.427 --> 01:19:33.929
What's going on ?
Wait !

01:19:35.934 --> 01:19:37.434
Ugh.

01:19:37.434 --> 01:19:40.940
What are you
trying to do ?
Come on, stop it.

01:19:43.942 --> 01:19:45.946
This is our school,

01:19:45.946 --> 01:19:47.949
Yeah.
Yeah.

01:19:47.949 --> 01:19:52.954
We have a right to know if
somethin' bogus is goin' down...

01:19:52.954 --> 01:19:54.455
In our school,
right ?

01:19:54.957 --> 01:19:56.959
Yeah.
Right.

01:19:56.959 --> 01:20:00.463
This homey right here
has taken you for a ride.

01:20:02.466 --> 01:20:06.470
His name isn't
Linkavitch Chomofsky,
and he's not from Estonia.

01:20:06.971 --> 01:20:10.476
Matt, will you just
stop this already ?

01:20:10.976 --> 01:20:14.482
Shush !
Trust me.

01:20:14.982 --> 01:20:18.487
They've all
been lying to us.

01:20:18.487 --> 01:20:20.992
But I found out.

01:20:20.992 --> 01:20:23.492
I know the truth.

01:20:23.492 --> 01:20:26.999
Do you wanna know
the truth ?
Yeah !

01:20:27.499 --> 01:20:31.002
Do you want to know
what he really is ?

01:20:31.002 --> 01:20:33.005
Yeah.
Yeah.

01:20:33.005 --> 01:20:35.008
Tell us the secret !

01:20:37.009 --> 01:20:39.015
He's a caveman.

01:20:43.521 --> 01:20:46.021
No. No !

01:20:46.021 --> 01:20:48.525
