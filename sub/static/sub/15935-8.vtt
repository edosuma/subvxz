00:13.985 --> 00:15.592
<i>Previously on</i> Masters of Sex...

00:15.630 --> 00:17.737
The grandparents made it clear.
Family only.

00:17.738 --> 00:20.865
You and me get married. I
then will adopt the baby

00:21.057 --> 00:22.898
so she is legally mine,

00:22.905 --> 00:25.323
and then the two of
us will get divorced.

00:25.381 --> 00:27.986
Nancy has struggled to find her
footing here from the start.

00:27.987 --> 00:29.722
Getting the Clavermores
back would go a long way

00:29.723 --> 00:32.261
to making her feel her
work here is valued.

00:32.262 --> 00:34.432
It wouldn't hurt you either, would it?

00:34.433 --> 00:36.937
Being able to bring your
wife a big case like that?

00:36.938 --> 00:38.740
I wanted nothing more than
for you to be my mentor.

00:38.741 --> 00:41.312
But instead, you just don't like me.

00:41.313 --> 00:42.448
I like your husband.

00:42.449 --> 00:44.785
Your lifestyle is hurtful

00:44.786 --> 00:46.489
and unfulfilling to him,

00:46.490 --> 00:47.625
and he doesn't dare say it

00:47.626 --> 00:49.462
for fear that you would leave him.

00:49.463 --> 00:51.099
We should be observing homosexuals

00:51.100 --> 00:53.470
exactly the same way
we did heterosexuals.

00:53.471 --> 00:55.374
Art, how do you feel about
laying the groundwork

00:55.375 --> 00:57.144
to broaden this into a study?

00:57.145 --> 00:58.647
I can start now.

00:58.648 --> 01:00.017
<i>Bill, it's Dody.</i>

01:00.018 --> 01:01.753
Maybe we should get together.

01:01.754 --> 01:02.788
I can come to you.

01:02.789 --> 01:03.658
William Masters?

01:03.659 --> 01:04.893
I'm expecting someone.

01:04.894 --> 01:06.462
My wife. She's not coming.

01:06.463 --> 01:07.765
Has something happened to Dody?

01:07.766 --> 01:09.635
Aside from you breaking her heart?

01:09.636 --> 01:11.339
Therapists are stealing our work.

01:11.340 --> 01:12.341
Put 'em out of business.

01:12.342 --> 01:14.345
We go in as patients.

01:14.346 --> 01:16.182
We go in there? Together?

01:16.183 --> 01:17.518
We each pick a clinic.

01:17.519 --> 01:19.523
<i>I'll take Topeka.</i>

02:02.419 --> 02:06.223

02:06.818 --> 02:09.020
You really need to work
on your penmanship, Guy.

02:09.021 --> 02:12.728
I can't tell... after Terra-Haute,
do I go north or south?

02:12.729 --> 02:15.000
And I forgot to tell
you you have to book

02:15.001 --> 02:16.837
Bill's room in Topeka
and mine in Bloomington

02:16.838 --> 02:19.008
under the same names that you
booked the clinic appointments.

02:19.009 --> 02:20.577
I didn't get that far.

02:20.578 --> 02:22.181
What do you mean? We both
leave in the morning.

02:22.182 --> 02:23.884
I mean I wasn't able
to book those sessions

02:23.885 --> 02:25.420
for you or Dr. Bill.

02:25.421 --> 02:27.725
I'm... I'm so sorry.

02:27.726 --> 02:29.228
It... I mean, it didn't occur to me

02:29.229 --> 02:32.000
when I sent you the letter that, um...

02:32.001 --> 02:35.574
but the last thing I want to
do is cause you any trouble.

02:35.575 --> 02:37.544
Well, I-I'm...

02:37.545 --> 02:40.016
just so happens I'm gonna
be in Topeka tomorrow.

02:40.017 --> 02:42.287
It's a-a last-minute business trip,

02:42.288 --> 02:46.229
and, uh, well, I was... I
was hoping we could meet.

02:46.230 --> 02:47.932
And please bring your husband.

02:47.933 --> 02:51.272
Uh, I want to put his mind
at ease about my intentions.

02:51.273 --> 02:52.575
Great. See you then.

02:54.446 --> 02:56.282
Do you have a minute?

02:56.283 --> 02:57.751
So, it turns out that these clinics

02:57.752 --> 02:59.622
only treat married couples.

02:59.623 --> 03:03.396
Guy tried to book individual
sessions at the Toplin Center

03:03.397 --> 03:05.100
and the Cleveland Sex Institute.

03:05.101 --> 03:06.937
No go.

03:06.938 --> 03:10.677
So, either we keep looking for
places that do treat singles,

03:10.678 --> 03:12.614
or we send Art and Nancy,

03:12.615 --> 03:14.285
which, obviously, is not my preference.

03:14.286 --> 03:17.391
Well, we should go to Topeka together.

03:17.392 --> 03:19.262
That makes the most sense.

03:22.135 --> 03:23.972
Okay, then.

03:27.579 --> 03:29.582
If the Clavermores do prove to be a case

03:29.583 --> 03:31.085
of ejaculatory incompetence,

03:31.086 --> 03:33.089
it won't be sensate that you recommend...

03:33.090 --> 03:34.792
Manual manipulation by the wife.

03:34.793 --> 03:36.930
Don't worry. I've got
the protocol memorized.

03:36.931 --> 03:38.166
Good.

03:38.167 --> 03:39.768
I'm trusting you with them.

03:39.769 --> 03:41.439
Gold-star clients. Potential patrons.

03:41.440 --> 03:43.142
I understand.

03:43.143 --> 03:44.612
You need to make sure you
have the Kinsey sixes paired

03:44.613 --> 03:45.948
with the other sixes,

03:45.949 --> 03:47.117
the fives with the fives, and so on.

03:47.118 --> 03:48.486
Yes. Don't worry.

03:48.487 --> 03:49.788
That's built into the
experimental method.

03:49.789 --> 03:51.659
And you have matched
the heterosexual study

03:51.660 --> 03:52.962
in all other essential points?

03:52.963 --> 03:54.098
I have.

03:54.099 --> 03:55.968
I highlighted the route.

03:55.969 --> 03:57.604
Also a few sight-seeing stops.

03:57.605 --> 03:59.475
Laura Ingalls Wilder's
house is along the way.

03:59.476 --> 04:00.543
Are we ready?

04:00.544 --> 04:02.281
Yes... oh, one more thing, Guy...

04:02.282 --> 04:04.151
Oh, I know. I am typing
up last week's intakes

04:04.152 --> 04:05.287
and bringing a casserole to Betty,

04:05.288 --> 04:06.823
and I will get the copier fixed.

04:06.824 --> 04:08.994
Did you manage to make a
copy of the Clavermore file

04:08.995 --> 04:10.163
before the machine broke?

04:10.164 --> 04:11.332
Yes. It's in my office.

04:11.333 --> 04:12.836
I'll go with you.

04:14.339 --> 04:18.413
Women... keep you waiting.

04:18.414 --> 04:20.017
Or so I'm told.

04:22.455 --> 04:25.293
Nancy, the other day... what
I said about your marriage,

04:25.294 --> 04:29.602
a-about Art's unhappiness
with the arrangement...

04:31.975 --> 04:34.044
I should not have said that.

04:34.045 --> 04:36.549
I crossed a line.

04:36.550 --> 04:39.021
It's fine. There's no need to apologize.

04:39.022 --> 04:43.029
I'm glad to know how Art really feels.

04:46.971 --> 04:48.841
Put on some music.

04:48.842 --> 04:50.911
Let's dance.

04:50.912 --> 04:53.216
We don't have a hi-fi.

04:53.217 --> 04:54.485
Nance...

04:54.486 --> 04:56.555
Nance, what are you doing?

05:00.531 --> 05:01.665
They've only been gone for a second.

05:01.666 --> 05:02.869
They might come back.

05:02.870 --> 05:05.473
A life lived in fear is no life at all.

05:05.474 --> 05:07.377
Oh, this is a comfortable chair.

05:07.378 --> 05:09.048
Let's see.

05:09.049 --> 05:11.285
What would Virginia do?

05:11.286 --> 05:13.122
Oh, I know.

05:13.123 --> 05:14.625
Art, could you bring me

05:14.626 --> 05:17.564
every single one of Nancy's case files?

05:17.565 --> 05:19.836
Well, she doesn't have time for that.

05:19.837 --> 05:22.240
She's too busy plotting
how to make Bill hers.

05:22.241 --> 05:23.743
Oh, she tell you that?

05:23.744 --> 05:26.148
She didn't have to. If I know Virginia,

05:26.149 --> 05:28.352
she'll take full advantage of this trip.

05:28.353 --> 05:30.523
They're posing as a couple, after all.

05:30.524 --> 05:32.227
They're going through treatment.

05:32.228 --> 05:34.731
I think she's hoping the
Masters and Johnson method

05:34.732 --> 05:36.602
will work on Masters and Johnson.

05:36.603 --> 05:38.874
It's unbelievable the
contortions some women will

05:38.875 --> 05:40.878
go through to bend a man to their will.

05:40.879 --> 05:43.183
She's a world-class gymnast.

05:45.254 --> 05:46.756
I could
get used to this.

05:48.694 --> 05:50.296
Mrs. Lavery just sat there

05:50.297 --> 05:52.634
as he took the Irish Setter, both cars,

05:52.635 --> 05:54.538
the house on Long Island... everything.

05:54.539 --> 05:56.041
I was itching to just

05:56.042 --> 05:57.945
dramatically bang on the
table or something.

05:57.946 --> 05:59.748
Why didn't you?

05:59.749 --> 06:01.418
Who wants to hear from
the peanut gallery?

06:01.419 --> 06:03.556
You have good instincts.
If holding out is

06:03.557 --> 06:04.826
in the best interest of the client,

06:04.827 --> 06:06.362
you talk them into it, you fight.

06:06.363 --> 06:08.399
There's no such thing
as an easy divorce.

06:08.400 --> 06:11.205
Hell, I've been working through
split number three since '66.

06:11.206 --> 06:13.209
You're still married?

06:13.210 --> 06:15.881
Only on paper. That remains unsigned.

06:15.882 --> 06:17.717
For three years?

06:17.718 --> 06:19.721
Well, I have an exceptional lawyer,

06:19.722 --> 06:21.358
but he's exceptional
enough to have a case load

06:21.359 --> 06:23.129
that puts my divorce pretty far down

06:23.130 --> 06:24.398
on his list of priorities.

06:24.399 --> 06:26.101
Oh, I see. You are
representing yourself.

06:26.102 --> 06:28.139
I figured I deserved the best.

06:28.140 --> 06:31.045
Hmm. The best probably would've
settled two years ago.

06:31.046 --> 06:32.581
I'll get around...

06:32.582 --> 06:33.550
Oh!

06:33.551 --> 06:35.720
Oh, my God, are you okay?

06:36.624 --> 06:38.627
Oh, open up. Let me see.

06:40.231 --> 06:41.599
Oh, you broke a crown.

06:41.600 --> 06:43.402
Mm-hmm.

06:43.403 --> 06:45.740
You think it's possible my
ex-wife planted this...

06:45.741 --> 06:47.177
walnut shell?

06:47.178 --> 06:49.147
Was that in your food?
God, that is absurd.

06:49.148 --> 06:50.985
Uh, excuse me. Uh, can you send

06:50.986 --> 06:51.854
the manager over here, please?

06:53.257 --> 06:54.859
I got to get to Doc
Sugarman to either fix this

06:54.860 --> 06:56.695
or give me a fistful of Percodan.

06:56.696 --> 06:57.932
You stay and gripe.

06:57.933 --> 06:59.368
- Well, I... okay.
- Ah! Ah!

06:59.369 --> 07:00.503
You're gonna run someone off the road.

07:00.504 --> 07:01.906
I will drive you.

07:01.907 --> 07:03.877
Easy, easy.

07:03.878 --> 07:06.082
I'm gonna take this. For evidence.

07:12.728 --> 07:15.633
Do you think this will still
pick up our conversation

07:15.634 --> 07:18.606
if it's not right at the top of the bag?

07:18.607 --> 07:20.610
Keller says we have to
get these people on tape

07:20.611 --> 07:23.015
if we want to pursue a
patent infringement.

07:23.016 --> 07:24.618
What if we tell them we're
both hard of hearing,

07:24.619 --> 07:26.422
and they have to speak up?

07:26.423 --> 07:27.925
Maybe that's how we met:

07:27.926 --> 07:29.528
at a mixer for the hearing impaired.

07:29.529 --> 07:33.636
We do need a cover story, so...
who do you want to be?

07:33.637 --> 07:35.941
Ooh,

07:35.942 --> 07:37.777
I've always wanted to be an Earl.

07:37.778 --> 07:39.681
Yes, well, I've always
wanted to be a duchess,

07:39.682 --> 07:41.385
but I don't think it's a good idea

07:41.386 --> 07:43.155
to pose as English nobility.

07:43.156 --> 07:46.328
No. I mean I've always
liked the name Earl.

07:46.329 --> 07:48.232
Earls are good guys. Hmm.

07:48.233 --> 07:50.838
Earls can tell your tires need air

07:50.839 --> 07:53.142
just by listening to the engine.

07:53.143 --> 07:54.378
Right.

07:54.379 --> 07:55.881
Maybe something more neutral.

07:55.882 --> 07:57.350
Didn't you just buy me

07:57.351 --> 07:59.020
a moustache and a suede jacket?

07:59.021 --> 08:00.757
I think that makes me an Earl.

08:00.758 --> 08:03.930
And you're... uh, what color
is the wig you bought?

08:03.931 --> 08:05.433
Blonde-ish.

08:05.434 --> 08:06.836
Ingrid. Ingrid Sorenson.

08:06.837 --> 08:08.372
Ingrid Sorenson MacAfee.

08:08.373 --> 08:10.676
Fine. Fine. I will be Ingrid

08:10.677 --> 08:14.151
if you don't talk like you
have a plug of chewin' tobacky

08:14.152 --> 08:15.353
in your cheek.

08:15.354 --> 08:17.023
- Hey.
- What's our issue?

08:17.024 --> 08:19.127
I think you should be frigid.

08:19.128 --> 08:21.732
Don't you think ejaculatory
incompetence would work better?

08:21.733 --> 08:23.302
- Better for whom?
- Better for us.

08:23.303 --> 08:25.039
After all, we have a very
specific methodology

08:25.040 --> 08:28.179
to treat it, so that's one
way that we could see

08:28.180 --> 08:30.716
if these clinicians are
cribbing our protocol.

08:30.717 --> 08:32.754
So, what's our backstory?

08:32.755 --> 08:37.764
Mm, Mr. Clavermore suffers
from ejaculatory incompetence.

08:37.765 --> 08:40.837
I have his file. Why don't
we just use their history?

08:40.839 --> 08:44.880
Filched identity to expose
a purloined therapy.

08:46.783 --> 08:48.252
I guess
two wrongs make a right

08:48.253 --> 08:49.754
in your book, huh, darlin'?

08:49.755 --> 08:51.358
You're not really gonna
talk like that, are you?

08:51.359 --> 08:53.363
- Like what?
- Like a hillbilly.

08:54.599 --> 08:55.901
I'm very good at accents.

08:55.902 --> 08:58.305
No! No, you're not.

08:58.306 --> 09:00.109
You just think that you are.

09:00.110 --> 09:02.146
It's like how everybody thinks
that they have good taste.

09:02.147 --> 09:03.749
That can't be true.

09:03.750 --> 09:07.557
How would that explain lava lamps?

09:07.558 --> 09:12.400
Okay, Clavermores, what is
your inciting incident?

09:12.401 --> 09:16.408
Oh, hi. Dr. Austin Langham
to see Bill or Virginia.

09:16.409 --> 09:19.414
Langham? You're Betty's friend.

09:19.415 --> 09:21.285
Uh, Betty's husband, actually.

09:21.286 --> 09:23.188
So, you two did it. You tied the knot.

09:23.189 --> 09:25.560
- Yep.
- How's Betty doing?

09:25.561 --> 09:27.263
She will be better when we get the baby.

09:27.264 --> 09:29.067
And how soon till that happens?

09:29.068 --> 09:31.605
Uh, I filed for custody.
Hearing's in a few weeks.

09:31.606 --> 09:34.144
Uh, between now and then, I
need to prove that I'm capable

09:34.145 --> 09:35.948
of supporting the baby financially, so...

09:35.949 --> 09:38.118
Oh, so, you came to pick
up Betty's paycheck?

09:38.119 --> 09:39.989
Sure. Yeah, yeah. Every
little bit helps.

09:39.990 --> 09:42.093
But, uh, you know, actually,
I'm-I'm-I'm, uh, here

09:42.094 --> 09:44.464
to see the docs about, uh,
an exciting new product.

09:44.465 --> 09:46.301
It is the, uh, finest men's...

09:46.302 --> 09:47.838
Health appliance on the market.

09:47.839 --> 09:50.276
The Virility Vacuum.

09:50.277 --> 09:51.511
Patent pending.

09:51.512 --> 09:53.116
It's a penis pump.

09:54.518 --> 09:56.154
Hello, Lester.

09:56.155 --> 09:58.425
Uh, and yes, in everyday
usage, that's correct, but...

09:58.426 --> 09:59.996
- May I?
- Sure, sure.

09:59.997 --> 10:01.632
I see you've gone back
to selling snake oil.

10:01.633 --> 10:04.671
Hoping to repeat your
success at Fat-O-Metric?

10:04.672 --> 10:05.874
Cal-O-Metric.

10:05.875 --> 10:07.176
And this isn't snake oil.

10:07.177 --> 10:08.612
This is a life-saving medical product.

10:08.613 --> 10:10.116
It's a cure for impotence

10:10.117 --> 10:12.153
that I have come to offer your patients.

10:12.154 --> 10:14.190
That's not what we do
around here, Austin.

10:14.191 --> 10:16.328
What we do here is rooted in science.

10:16.329 --> 10:17.530
Well, this... this is science.

10:17.531 --> 10:19.401
Yeah, this... this is hard science.

10:19.402 --> 10:23.208
Guy, don't let him talk
you into buying anything.

10:24.146 --> 10:25.513
He's never liked me.

10:25.514 --> 10:27.750
So, uh, if I could speak
to Bill or Virginia...

10:27.751 --> 10:29.521
Neither of them is in today.

10:29.522 --> 10:31.558
Oh, well, uh, in that case, I'd
better leave some pamphlets,

10:31.559 --> 10:33.262
maybe even put up a display.

10:33.263 --> 10:34.731
I got a sandwich board in my car.

10:34.732 --> 10:36.234
- Is that a good idea?
- Well, I wouldn't want

10:36.235 --> 10:37.871
anyone in need to miss
the chance, you know?

10:37.872 --> 10:40.209
And, um, every dollar I make
goes to helping me and Betty

10:40.210 --> 10:41.913
get the baby back, so...

10:41.914 --> 10:43.048
I'll be right back.

10:43.049 --> 10:44.751
Well...

10:44.752 --> 10:47.124
uh... well...

10:52.735 --> 10:54.270
You're the manager here, correct?

10:54.271 --> 10:55.473
Hair in the soup?

10:55.474 --> 10:56.976
What? No.

10:56.977 --> 10:59.748
I should probably stop
guessing in these situations.

10:59.749 --> 11:01.551
I have a dental bill
to discuss with you.

11:01.552 --> 11:04.324
A customer of yours was accosted
by a stray walnut shell.

11:04.325 --> 11:05.760
Accosted?

11:05.761 --> 11:07.497
He broke a crown. I'm sure you heard.

11:07.498 --> 11:08.833
I haven't.

11:08.834 --> 11:10.871
But I have heard that
the eggs are too runny,

11:10.872 --> 11:12.875
the coffee is cold.

11:12.876 --> 11:15.246
Listen. I run a diner.
If I handed out money

11:15.247 --> 11:17.216
every time a customer wasn't satisfied...

11:17.217 --> 11:19.220
He's not dissatisfied. He is disabled.

11:19.221 --> 11:20.523
Oh, yeah, that's rich.

11:20.524 --> 11:22.093
He had to miss half a day in court

11:22.094 --> 11:23.729
in order to have his tooth fixed.

11:23.730 --> 11:26.301
That is what we refer to as lost wages.

11:26.302 --> 11:29.107
Who's "we"? I saw you come in
here twice yesterday 'cause

11:29.108 --> 11:32.146
you didn't get your boss's
ham loaf on rye quite right.

11:32.147 --> 11:34.584
You're a secretary. You're not a lawyer.

11:34.585 --> 11:37.089
So you're as able to take
this to court as I am.

11:37.090 --> 11:40.429
Just leave the lawsuits
to those with a degree.

11:40.430 --> 11:42.969
Come on. I need two navy bean.
Let's go. Step it up.

11:45.440 --> 11:47.343
As you can see, all the
treatment rooms are upstairs.

11:47.344 --> 11:48.579
- Mm-hm.
- I see you've travelled

11:48.580 --> 11:49.614
quite a ways.

11:49.615 --> 11:51.151
Albuquerque.

11:51.152 --> 11:53.957
Have you ever sought out any
treatment closer to home?

11:53.958 --> 11:56.461
Well, Ingrid and I are, uh...

11:56.462 --> 11:59.601
we want to deal with our
situation, uh, aggressively.

11:59.602 --> 12:01.939
- Ah... yeah.
- It's gone on long enough,

12:01.940 --> 12:05.212
and, uh, so when we saw you
offer a-a one-week program...

12:05.213 --> 12:07.083
Is that really enough time?

12:07.084 --> 12:09.587
It is the first question Harvey
and I are usually asked.

12:09.588 --> 12:10.925
Please, sit.

12:12.896 --> 12:15.799
Sounds too good to be
true, doesn't it, Earl?

12:15.800 --> 12:18.907
Go ahead. M-may I call you Earl?

12:18.908 --> 12:20.609
- Yep.
- Ingrid?

12:20.610 --> 12:21.913
We don't like to be too formal.

12:21.914 --> 12:24.484
We've found a truly immersive approach

12:24.485 --> 12:25.954
yields the best results.

12:25.955 --> 12:29.627
By taking time out
from your daily lives,

12:29.628 --> 12:33.937
you're... you're making your
sexual relationship a priority.

12:33.938 --> 12:35.639
- Mm-hm.
- Yeah.

12:35.640 --> 12:38.111
We'd like you to see this
as kind of a holiday...

12:38.112 --> 12:40.516
Mm-hmm.
- an opportunity to relax

12:40.517 --> 12:44.057
and explore and fall in
love all over again.

12:44.058 --> 12:48.332
And-and you treat couples
together, a-as a couple?

12:48.333 --> 12:50.703
Well, there are parts of the process

12:50.704 --> 12:52.406
we find more productive to divide up

12:52.407 --> 12:53.709
- along gender lines.
- Mm-hmm.

12:53.710 --> 12:55.479
People are
often more comfortable

12:55.480 --> 12:57.149
speaking to a therapist of the same sex.

12:57.150 --> 13:00.089
Um, is that something that
y-you discovered yourselves,

13:00.090 --> 13:02.026
or is that standard among therapists?

13:02.027 --> 13:04.030
It's not standard at all.

13:04.031 --> 13:06.534
Years of work with couples
have led us to develop

13:06.535 --> 13:08.973
a very specific technique

13:08.974 --> 13:12.613
that, uh, works more quickly
and effectively than others.

13:12.614 --> 13:14.117
What's also unique
is our intake method.

13:14.118 --> 13:15.686
Mm-hmm.

13:15.687 --> 13:18.125
Questionnaire that covers
your sexual history

13:18.126 --> 13:19.527
that functions as the foundation

13:19.528 --> 13:21.031
- of our treatment.
- Yeah.

13:21.032 --> 13:22.500
Couples learn a
lot about each other

13:22.501 --> 13:24.203
- during our process.
- Hmm.

13:24.204 --> 13:26.876
Often, they discover
things they never knew.

13:26.877 --> 13:29.915
Are you ready to... begin?

13:31.419 --> 13:33.088
Here you go.

13:33.089 --> 13:35.827
Yeah.

13:35.828 --> 13:38.165
We wrote it down
in our questionnaires.

13:38.166 --> 13:40.702
Do we need to go through it again?

13:40.703 --> 13:42.908
It's helpful to hear
things described out loud.

13:42.909 --> 13:44.444
It's part of the therapy.

13:44.445 --> 13:46.514
Why don't you begin with the incident

13:46.515 --> 13:48.218
that occurred around the time you found

13:48.219 --> 13:50.924
you could no longer orgasm
during intercourse?

13:50.925 --> 13:52.961
It was two years ago.

13:52.962 --> 13:55.099
We were in bed, making love.

13:55.100 --> 13:58.705
I felt myself getting
closer, about to orgasm.

13:58.706 --> 13:59.875
But then something happened.

13:59.876 --> 14:02.914
I heard a noise, and the door opened.

14:02.915 --> 14:06.588
And then I saw our daughter
Juliet's youngest...

14:06.589 --> 14:08.225
- Our son...
- Benjamin.

14:08.226 --> 14:10.864
Benjamin standing there
in the... in the doorway

14:10.865 --> 14:12.333
in-in his pajamas.

14:12.334 --> 14:16.674
I knew I should stop.
But I couldn't stop.

14:16.675 --> 14:18.712
I... you know, I was already coming.

14:18.713 --> 14:21.084
And he-he looked scared.

14:21.085 --> 14:24.858
He thought I... that I was
trying to hurt his mother.

14:24.859 --> 14:27.396
And that's how our problem started.

14:27.397 --> 14:29.033
Is that something that can be treated?

14:29.034 --> 14:32.406
It is. Do you masturbate
successfully on your own?

14:32.407 --> 14:33.775
- I do.
- He does.

14:33.776 --> 14:35.479
Good, then we can skip a few steps

14:35.480 --> 14:37.716
and, uh, begin with teaching you how...

14:37.717 --> 14:39.620
to manually
stimulate your husband.

14:39.621 --> 14:41.926
Once Earl is comfortable including you

14:41.927 --> 14:43.428
in his masturbation,

14:43.429 --> 14:45.165
you can move towards the second step...

14:45.166 --> 14:47.603
which involves stimulating
him until he reaches

14:47.604 --> 14:50.509
what we call the first
phase of orgasmic return.

14:50.510 --> 14:52.780
That's when it feels inevitable to you

14:52.781 --> 14:55.752
that you're going to orgasm.

14:55.753 --> 14:59.126
You then move over him into
the female-superior position

14:59.127 --> 15:00.964
and capture his penis...

15:00.965 --> 15:03.101
<i>introducing it
into the vaginal canal.</i>

15:03.102 --> 15:06.809
As he ejaculates, you begin
a series of pelvic thrusts.

15:06.810 --> 15:09.780
It's a process that moves the
two of you towards orgasm

15:09.781 --> 15:13.088
without being stopped by any
memory of the triggering event.

15:13.089 --> 15:15.225
Your story is consistent
with a pattern we find

15:15.226 --> 15:18.732
in many cases of
ejaculatory incompetence.

15:18.733 --> 15:21.972
The presence of a specific
traumatic episode

15:21.973 --> 15:25.779
which blocks a man's ability
to ejaculate introvaginally.

15:25.780 --> 15:28.151
He feels too much shame.

15:28.152 --> 15:29.587
Shame's a powerful inhibitor

15:29.588 --> 15:33.495
not just to sexual health,
but to true intimacy.

15:33.496 --> 15:35.699
Previously in your marriage, Earl,

15:35.700 --> 15:38.339
when have you experienced
that kind of shame?

15:42.781 --> 15:44.684
Never.

15:44.685 --> 15:47.323
Never? Really?

15:47.324 --> 15:48.893
Well, you'll forgive me,

15:48.894 --> 15:51.064
but never is the kind of
word intended to block

15:51.065 --> 15:53.501
further exploration in its tracks.

15:53.502 --> 15:55.672
So let's-let's stay
on this for a moment.

15:55.673 --> 15:57.042
You've never felt shame

15:57.043 --> 16:00.716
at failing to please her?

16:00.717 --> 16:02.586
- You've never come too fast...
- Yeah.

16:02.587 --> 16:04.323
Or on occasion not gotten hard?

16:04.324 --> 16:06.127
Mm-hmm.

16:06.128 --> 16:08.131
Perhaps you've had fantasies
that don't involve her,

16:08.132 --> 16:10.803
or you wanted to engage her in behavior

16:10.804 --> 16:13.608
that you worry she might
consider perverse?

16:13.609 --> 16:15.712
Uh, actually, uh, Marcia,
from the beginning, uh,

16:15.713 --> 16:19.855
my husband and I... we've had
a very satisfying sex life.

16:19.856 --> 16:23.395
Uh, we've always been extremely
open with our desires.

16:23.396 --> 16:26.033
Unafraid to express ourselves.

16:26.034 --> 16:28.171
There's really nothing, uh,
that either of us have wanted

16:28.172 --> 16:29.975
that we've hesitated to ask the other.

16:29.976 --> 16:33.047
- Really?
- So, role playing, positions,

16:33.048 --> 16:36.188
toys, language... none of
it has been off-limits?

16:37.657 --> 16:39.160
- Wow.
- That is wonderful.

16:39.161 --> 16:41.899
I mean, how lucky you are
to have found each other.

16:41.900 --> 16:43.903
We're very lucky.

16:43.904 --> 16:47.676
S-sometimes, sexual
dynamism of this sort

16:47.677 --> 16:50.415
l-launches out of
non-traditional circumstances.

16:50.416 --> 16:51.919
Such as?

16:51.920 --> 16:53.755
- Affairs, for one.
- Yeah.

16:53.756 --> 16:55.592
The clandestine nature
of a couple's beginnings

16:55.593 --> 16:58.298
might serve as erotic tinder.

16:58.299 --> 17:00.569
Yeah. Were either of
you involved with other people

17:00.570 --> 17:01.738
when you met?

17:06.515 --> 17:08.718
Well, that's a very loud silence.

17:14.832 --> 17:18.271
I-I-I was...

17:18.271 --> 17:19.406
married.

17:21.712 --> 17:23.414
Do you want to say more about that?

17:23.415 --> 17:26.922
No. No, Harvey, I don't.

17:26.923 --> 17:28.725
Eh, it might help, Earl.

17:28.726 --> 17:30.863
I don't see how.

17:30.864 --> 17:34.203
Well, perhaps the shock
and disapproval you fear

17:34.204 --> 17:35.639
from your son

17:35.640 --> 17:38.478
is really what you fear
from your former wife

17:38.479 --> 17:41.384
had she walked in on you
and Ingrid making love.

17:41.385 --> 17:46.160
Perhaps, uh, your ejaculatory issues

17:46.161 --> 17:49.600
are a form of penance for
having betrayed her.

17:49.601 --> 17:52.339
No. I-I-I don't think it's that at all.

17:52.340 --> 17:54.610
Maybe the judgment and
condemnation you fear

17:54.611 --> 17:56.949
- is your own, Earl.
- Mm-hmm.

17:56.950 --> 18:01.123
Maybe on some subconscious
level, you've decided

18:01.124 --> 18:03.294
that you're undeserving of pleasure,

18:03.295 --> 18:05.732
of a satisfactory resolution,

18:05.733 --> 18:07.937
- of a happily ever after...
- Mm-hmm.

18:07.938 --> 18:12.279
Literally undeserving of
finishing what you started.

18:12.280 --> 18:16.587
Maybe the boy standing
at that door, watching,

18:16.588 --> 18:18.592
is you.

18:24.104 --> 18:26.140
So, tomorrow when you come in,

18:26.141 --> 18:28.979
you'll have the option of doing
the exercise at your hotel

18:28.980 --> 18:31.250
or here in one of our
treatment bedrooms,

18:31.251 --> 18:32.920
where we can personally instruct you.

18:32.921 --> 18:35.659
We will prefer to do
them alone in our hotel.

18:35.660 --> 18:38.498
Uh, Nina's right.
Privacy is best for us.

18:38.499 --> 18:41.637
But I'd... I would like to see
the rest of the clinic.

18:41.638 --> 18:42.940
Do you have time to give us a tour?

18:42.941 --> 18:43.976
- Charles...
- Well, there's no harm

18:43.977 --> 18:45.211
in having a look.

18:45.212 --> 18:47.516
I would be happy to show you. This way.

18:47.517 --> 18:49.019
How many square feet is this place?

18:49.020 --> 18:50.221
Four thousand? Five?

18:50.222 --> 18:51.691
God, somewhere in between, I think.

18:51.692 --> 18:52.894
Uh, but there's another hallway

18:52.895 --> 18:54.697
with a bedroom studio and exam room.

18:54.698 --> 18:57.035
Yeah, and it's zoned for
the medical arts, huh?

18:57.036 --> 18:59.139
That is a, uh, a
not-for-profit business,

18:59.140 --> 19:02.012
which means a tax deduction
against the market price.

19:02.013 --> 19:04.450
Is that right?

19:04.451 --> 19:05.986
Shall we take a look?

19:05.987 --> 19:08.658
Oh, we'll be doing the
exercises at home.

19:08.659 --> 19:10.462
Your husband seems to be interested.

19:10.463 --> 19:14.536
Uh, Charles is not
interested in the treatment.

19:14.537 --> 19:16.373
He's falling in love.

19:16.374 --> 19:19.012
Oh, don't worry. Not with your wife.

19:19.013 --> 19:21.852
My husband doesn't fall for other women.

19:21.853 --> 19:24.056
He falls for other businesses.

19:24.057 --> 19:25.993
I thought he was in asbestos.

19:25.994 --> 19:27.796
It's his father's business.

19:27.797 --> 19:31.737
For Charles, it's merely a
fund for other businesses.

19:33.041 --> 19:34.409
A couple of weekends ago,

19:34.410 --> 19:36.848
we took our grandson to Coney Island.

19:36.849 --> 19:38.718
By the end of the afternoon,

19:38.719 --> 19:40.990
we owned an ice cream parlor.

19:42.527 --> 19:46.200
Nina, they're seeing
eight couples a day,

19:46.201 --> 19:48.104
and there's still a
three-month waiting list.

19:48.105 --> 19:50.775
Here in-in St. Louis, of all places.

19:50.776 --> 19:53.414
Can you imagine the business you'd do

19:53.415 --> 19:55.718
if this were in New
York or Philadelphia?

19:55.719 --> 19:57.924
I've said the same thing
to Art a dozen times,

19:57.925 --> 19:58.893
haven't I, Art?

19:58.894 --> 20:00.896
Uh, she has.

20:00.897 --> 20:03.301
Do you know that right now, Dr.
Masters and Mrs. Johnson are

20:03.302 --> 20:06.207
on the road investigating a
pair of charlatan therapists

20:06.208 --> 20:07.709
who claim to be using our method?

20:07.710 --> 20:09.479
There are clinics popping up everywhere.

20:09.480 --> 20:10.782
I just... I keep saying to Art,

20:10.783 --> 20:12.786
"Shouldn't it be us opening one?"

20:12.787 --> 20:14.991
After all, we've been
properly trained and endorsed

20:14.992 --> 20:16.928
by Masters and Johnson themselves.

20:16.929 --> 20:18.397
It's a terrific scheme:

20:18.398 --> 20:20.635
you two take the Masters
and Johnson method

20:20.636 --> 20:21.770
to the masses.

20:21.771 --> 20:23.474
Yeah. Why make them come to a town

20:23.475 --> 20:24.844
where there's only one decent hotel?

20:26.681 --> 20:27.950
Well, we weren't even
sure where to make a reservation

20:27.951 --> 20:29.353
for dinner tonight.

20:29.354 --> 20:31.023
I am so sorry. We
should've thought of that

20:31.024 --> 20:32.927
and-and given you some suggestions.

20:32.928 --> 20:35.465
Marmaduke, Le Dauphine
if you want French.

20:35.466 --> 20:37.102
Uh, Alberto's for Italian.

20:37.103 --> 20:38.271
Well, why don't we do one better?

20:38.272 --> 20:39.841
Why don't you two pick a place,

20:39.842 --> 20:41.310
and we'll all have
dinner together tonight?

20:41.311 --> 20:43.681
Lovely.

20:43.682 --> 20:46.053
Did you like how they took
credit for the questionnaire,

20:46.054 --> 20:48.825
75% of which is ours?

20:48.826 --> 20:51.563
Yeah, the protocol
is nearly identical too.

20:51.564 --> 20:54.002
Even the language in the handout:

20:54.003 --> 20:56.073
"Once the man's interest
in sensate focus

20:56.074 --> 20:58.411
has been aroused, the
woman is encouraged

20:58.412 --> 21:01.050
to manipulate the penis with authority,

21:01.051 --> 21:02.954
specifically asking for direction

21:02.955 --> 21:04.523
in stimulative techniques."

21:04.524 --> 21:06.293
"With authority" isn't ours.

21:06.294 --> 21:08.832
Well, no. We say "demandingly,"
but that hardly matters.

21:08.833 --> 21:10.970
Keller says this is
precisely what we need

21:10.971 --> 21:12.672
to pursue a claim against them.

21:12.673 --> 21:15.178
"With authority" is good. It's
better than "demandingly."

21:15.179 --> 21:17.315
I hardly think that anything of theirs

21:17.316 --> 21:18.986
is worth appropriating, Bill.

21:18.987 --> 21:21.290
Well, they may be thieves,
but they're not quacks.

21:21.291 --> 21:22.692
You have to admit

21:22.693 --> 21:25.031
they demonstrated a
certain level of insight.

21:25.032 --> 21:27.068
What, exactly?

21:27.069 --> 21:29.874
To fabricated circumstances?

21:29.875 --> 21:32.379
Do you really think that the
ejaculatory incompetence

21:32.380 --> 21:34.483
that you don't suffer from was caused

21:34.484 --> 21:37.555
by shame from your fictional childhood?

21:37.556 --> 21:39.059
But it's interesting, though...

21:39.060 --> 21:43.100
the suggestion that feeling
undeserving of pleasure

21:43.101 --> 21:45.271
can affect the way a
man perceives himself,

21:45.272 --> 21:47.342
um, choices he makes.

21:47.343 --> 21:49.613
No. There's nothing to
be learned from people

21:49.614 --> 21:52.519
whose entire practice is
founded in dishonesty.

21:52.520 --> 21:55.391
You know, anyway, we should...
we should go over the specifics

21:55.392 --> 21:57.362
of what we're going to tell them
tomorrow, so how many times

21:57.363 --> 21:58.965
shall we say I manipulated
you to orgasm?

21:58.966 --> 22:01.603
What makes the most sense?
What sounds reasonable?

22:01.604 --> 22:04.811
Twice? We should say twice.

22:04.812 --> 22:07.415
I think.

22:07.416 --> 22:08.351
I'm sorry.

22:08.352 --> 22:10.254
I'm starving.

22:10.255 --> 22:11.825
I can't even think straight.

22:11.826 --> 22:14.529
I saw a fried chicken
place across the street.

22:14.530 --> 22:16.835
Should we get some?

22:16.836 --> 22:19.907
I was thinking of calling
it an early night.

22:19.908 --> 22:22.045
Oh. Are you sure?

22:22.046 --> 22:23.714
Well, it's been a long day.

22:23.715 --> 22:26.386
Let's go over our story in
the morning, Virginia, okay?

22:26.387 --> 22:27.590
Okay.

22:29.260 --> 22:31.296
We're gonna take
this to court, right?

22:31.297 --> 22:32.465
And we'll win?

22:32.466 --> 22:35.906
We'll win big. Huge.

22:35.907 --> 22:38.244
Will a judge preside over a $50 suit?

22:38.245 --> 22:41.083
Suit?

22:41.084 --> 22:42.118
I thought we were

22:42.119 --> 22:43.922
in some kind of role play,

22:43.923 --> 22:46.126
which, by the way, is the only reality

22:46.127 --> 22:48.164
where you could actually sue the diner.

22:48.165 --> 22:50.735
But it was gross negligence
for them to be so cavalier

22:50.736 --> 22:52.071
about their food.

22:52.072 --> 22:53.274
It's not their negligence.

22:53.275 --> 22:55.144
It's product liability.

22:55.145 --> 22:57.682
The negligence is
contributory, meaning...

22:57.683 --> 22:59.319
Well, I know what contributory means.

22:59.320 --> 23:01.123
And you can't prove
that what happened was

23:01.124 --> 23:03.060
entirely the cook's fault,
so you've got nothing.

23:03.061 --> 23:05.231
You only pursue legal
action when you know

23:05.232 --> 23:07.135
the tort in question is egregious.

23:07.136 --> 23:08.771
But those cases don't exist.

23:08.772 --> 23:10.308
That is not true.

23:10.309 --> 23:12.980
And I'll give you a perfect example.

23:12.981 --> 23:17.990
A woman who carries on an
affair with husband's intern...

23:17.991 --> 23:19.593
- Mm.
- The fault in the divorce

23:19.594 --> 23:20.963
is clearly hers,

23:20.964 --> 23:23.835
and yet, the ex-wife has
the gall to demand...

23:23.836 --> 23:27.108
Well, she is not your ex.

23:27.109 --> 23:28.311
Not yet.

23:30.082 --> 23:32.953
So, when you said you hadn't
gotten around to the divorce,

23:32.954 --> 23:35.625
what you meant is you're
refusing to negotiate.

23:35.626 --> 23:37.629
She doesn't want to negotiate.

23:37.630 --> 23:39.799
- Uh-huh.
- She knows what she wants.

23:39.800 --> 23:41.838
- The canoe I built, hmm?
- Hmm.

23:41.839 --> 23:45.211
The suit of armor I
bought on our honeymoon,

23:45.212 --> 23:48.952
the jade earrings passed
down by my grandmother.

23:48.953 --> 23:51.556
What are you gonna do
with jade earrings?

23:51.557 --> 23:52.793
Hmm?

23:56.367 --> 23:58.537
What does it matter? You
want a black-and-white case,

23:58.538 --> 23:59.572
this is it.

23:59.573 --> 24:01.911
This is when you take a stand.

24:01.912 --> 24:04.616
Over trinkets?

24:04.617 --> 24:06.620
And you want to bring a
diner to financial ruin

24:06.621 --> 24:09.159
over a $50 dental bill.

24:09.160 --> 24:10.661
It's the principle.

24:10.662 --> 24:13.467
The difference is I have
the law on my side.

24:13.468 --> 24:15.639
I can't say the same about you.

24:31.003 --> 24:32.405
Hello, Billy.

24:32.406 --> 24:34.977
It's you.

24:34.978 --> 24:37.648
Uh, what... just... just you?

24:37.649 --> 24:38.818
Your husband?

24:38.819 --> 24:41.423
Oh, no, N-Nathan's not coming.

24:41.424 --> 24:44.529
He thought it would be
awkward, the three of us.

24:44.530 --> 24:48.504
What, so, he's all right?
Because last week, uh...

24:48.505 --> 24:50.842
I think you asking him to join us

24:50.843 --> 24:54.082
made him feel comfortable declining.

24:54.083 --> 24:56.353
Shall we? I made a reservation

24:56.354 --> 24:58.023
at a very nice Italian restaurant.

24:58.024 --> 25:00.628
At least I think it's nice.
I've never been.

25:00.629 --> 25:03.467
All I know is that it's dark.
I-I wanted someplace dark,

25:03.468 --> 25:07.208
because, well, 30 years is a long time.

25:07.209 --> 25:09.212
Oh, stop it. Come on.

25:09.213 --> 25:13.822
You look... lovely.

25:13.823 --> 25:16.426
Oh, you're gonna need a tie.
It's that kind of place.

25:16.427 --> 25:18.263
Um, hmm, I'm not sure I brought a tie.

25:18.264 --> 25:20.836
Maybe there's one stuffed
away in my suitcase.

25:20.837 --> 25:21.938
Come in, please, won't you?

25:21.939 --> 25:23.541
Oh, okay.

25:33.027 --> 25:34.562
Uh... oh, tie.

25:34.563 --> 25:36.533
Oh, we can go someplace else.

25:36.534 --> 25:38.403
Or we could just stay in.

25:38.404 --> 25:41.944
Oh, there's a-a fried chicken
place across the street.

25:41.945 --> 25:43.948
It doesn't matter to me.

25:43.949 --> 25:48.290
W-well, um, why don't... why don't
we have a-a conversation here?

25:48.291 --> 25:50.094
- Oh.
- Just get some things

25:50.095 --> 25:52.666
- out of the way?
- Okay.

26:07.029 --> 26:09.432
Your husband said

26:09.433 --> 26:13.875
that I-I broke your heart...

26:13.876 --> 26:14.944
all those years ago.

26:14.945 --> 26:18.083
I... honestly, I-I don't...

26:18.084 --> 26:20.554
I don't know what I did.

26:20.555 --> 26:24.495
Unless maybe you saw my note
as-as some kind of joke?

26:24.496 --> 26:26.466
- Your note?
- Yeah, the-the note

26:26.467 --> 26:28.337
I sent you at the
hospital with the roses...

26:28.338 --> 26:32.678
the two dozen long-stemmed roses.

26:32.679 --> 26:36.020
There was no note, no roses.

26:37.623 --> 26:40.160
No, the-the roses I
left at the hospital.

26:40.161 --> 26:42.598
It was after visiting hours,
so I gave them to the nurse,

26:42.599 --> 26:45.805
and told her to prop the note up

26:45.806 --> 26:47.810
where you'd be sure to see it.

26:49.814 --> 26:52.151
Well, she didn't.

26:52.152 --> 26:53.687
I didn't get it.

26:56.694 --> 27:01.136
And I didn't understand what I had done.

27:01.137 --> 27:04.275
Why you pulled away.

27:04.276 --> 27:08.985
Well, I-I was waiting for you to say...

27:08.986 --> 27:12.458
uh, something.

27:12.459 --> 27:14.963
And when you... when you didn't...

27:16.767 --> 27:18.971
Oh.

27:22.145 --> 27:25.784
You should've said something.
Why didn't you?

27:25.785 --> 27:29.792
Well, I thought you were telling
me something with your silence.

27:29.793 --> 27:31.898
But I loved you.

27:33.701 --> 27:36.373
Couldn't you see that?

27:39.379 --> 27:43.921
I guess I'm... I must
have had a hard time

27:43.922 --> 27:47.161
believing that...

27:47.162 --> 27:49.065
believing that a-a girl like you

27:49.066 --> 27:52.339
would ever see something
worthwhile in-in me.

27:55.411 --> 27:57.850
What did the note say?

28:02.392 --> 28:04.395
Well, what does it matter now?

28:04.396 --> 28:07.234
Because I want to know

28:07.235 --> 28:12.244
if I might have had an
entirely different life

28:12.245 --> 28:15.084
with a different man.

28:17.589 --> 28:20.595
Did you ask me a question
in that letter, Billy?

28:26.273 --> 28:28.277
I did.

28:32.719 --> 28:36.727
I would've said yes.

28:57.803 --> 28:59.005
Need a hand?

28:59.006 --> 29:01.175
Oh, uh, do you mind?

29:01.176 --> 29:02.544
Not at all.

29:02.545 --> 29:04.582
Glad for the distraction.

29:04.583 --> 29:06.686
Just waiting for my wife.

29:06.687 --> 29:10.227
Oh. Have a nice stay?

29:10.228 --> 29:13.566
No, we didn't, uh...

29:13.567 --> 29:15.370
yeah, she-she doesn't know I'm here.

29:17.242 --> 29:19.712
I taught her how to drive,
but, uh, she never really got

29:19.713 --> 29:22.618
the hang of the rearview mirror.

29:22.619 --> 29:24.622
You followed her?

29:24.623 --> 29:26.894
Uh, she told me she was going
to Darla Barroli's house

29:26.895 --> 29:28.998
to help organize the book drive.

29:28.999 --> 29:30.935
I mean, before she left
the house tonight,

29:30.936 --> 29:35.143
I saw her try on two dresses
and three shades of lipstick.

29:35.144 --> 29:37.681
Wonder if she did that for Darla,

29:37.682 --> 29:41.122
or if the, uh, book drive
is now headquartered

29:41.123 --> 29:44.529
in the Jojim Arms, room 211.

29:45.765 --> 29:49.438
Two eleven? Are you sure?

29:49.439 --> 29:51.844
It's an old boyfriend of hers.

29:51.845 --> 29:54.048
No, he's more than that.

29:54.049 --> 29:55.384
If she were here, she'd
probably tell you

29:55.385 --> 29:58.156
he's the love of her life.

29:58.157 --> 30:00.494
Hell, I thought we were happy, you know?

30:00.495 --> 30:01.629
I mean, should I have
brought her flowers

30:01.630 --> 30:03.133
more than just on her birthday?

30:03.134 --> 30:05.872
Sure. Do I watch the TV out
of the corner of my eye

30:05.873 --> 30:08.143
while she's going on about
her piano students?

30:08.144 --> 30:09.980
Sometimes. Okay, fine.

30:09.981 --> 30:13.686
But not all the time. I try. I do.

30:13.687 --> 30:16.159
He's, like, this big-shot doctor.

30:16.160 --> 30:18.063
Like a... like a sex doctor.
Can you believe?

30:18.064 --> 30:20.033
Jesus Christ, the guy's
probably doing stuff...

30:20.034 --> 30:22.571
And you're just sitting
here letting it happen?

30:22.572 --> 30:25.043
Why? What would you do?

30:25.044 --> 30:27.214
Kick the door in.

30:27.215 --> 30:29.585
Pull her out of there.
I'd-I'd teach that guy

30:29.586 --> 30:32.758
to keep his hands off my wife.

30:32.759 --> 30:33.861
Maybe I will.

30:33.862 --> 30:35.063
You should.

30:35.064 --> 30:37.402
I would, if I were you.

30:43.280 --> 30:46.452
I wish you would say something.

30:46.453 --> 30:48.457
It would be better
than all this silence.

30:51.797 --> 30:53.299
Just tell me what you're thinking.

30:53.300 --> 30:54.302
Ooh.

30:56.140 --> 30:57.674
All right, you want to
know what I'm thinking?

30:57.675 --> 30:59.178
- Yeah.
- Here's what I'm thinking:

30:59.179 --> 31:01.182
I think by agreeing to
dinner with patients,

31:01.183 --> 31:02.684
you overstepped every boundary

31:02.685 --> 31:04.455
of your professional
relationship with them.

31:04.456 --> 31:07.261
As if that weren't bad enough,
you spent half the meal

31:07.262 --> 31:08.898
talking about the ways that the clinic,

31:08.899 --> 31:10.033
where you are a trusted employee,

31:10.034 --> 31:11.569
could be managed better.

31:11.570 --> 31:13.908
It's... I-I don't know
what the word for it is.

31:13.909 --> 31:17.781
Uh, indecent, maybe? Shameful?

31:17.782 --> 31:19.585
Wh...

31:19.586 --> 31:23.459
First of all, we-we had to
say yes to dinner, Art.

31:23.460 --> 31:25.564
It was clear they were
nervous about the treatment

31:25.565 --> 31:26.967
and seeking a deeper therapeutic bond.

31:26.968 --> 31:28.236
- Oh, come on.
- It would've been

31:28.237 --> 31:31.642
unprofessional and unkind not to go.

31:31.643 --> 31:34.816
You were angling, trying to
impress on a very rich man

31:34.817 --> 31:36.954
that he should invest in
our version of a clinic.

31:36.955 --> 31:38.623
I... that's not what...

31:38.624 --> 31:40.627
Do you remember that
ski vacation we took

31:40.628 --> 31:41.796
at Tremblant?

31:41.797 --> 31:43.600
Second year of med school?

31:43.601 --> 31:45.036
You were about to be evicted

31:45.037 --> 31:46.539
from your apartment... do you remember?

31:46.540 --> 31:48.142
You got on the lift with
that couple from Westmount?

31:48.143 --> 31:49.778
You didn't even know them.

31:49.779 --> 31:52.384
Yeah. They needed a house sitter
and-and I needed a house.

31:52.385 --> 31:53.854
Well, most people do not come away

31:53.855 --> 31:55.490
from a five-minute chairlift ride

31:55.491 --> 31:57.862
with a two-year lease on
a Mount Royal penthouse.

31:57.863 --> 31:59.966
So I'm not most people. So what?

31:59.967 --> 32:02.805
Come on. That was... that
was mutually beneficial,

32:02.806 --> 32:03.974
which this could be too.

32:03.975 --> 32:05.310
So, you admit you were angling?

32:05.311 --> 32:06.479
Yeah. He took the lead, and I followed.

32:06.480 --> 32:08.182
Would've been a fool not to.

32:08.183 --> 32:09.351
Come on. You have to
admit that we have been

32:09.352 --> 32:10.921
treated terribly at this clinic.

32:10.922 --> 32:14.328
Our talents have... have been
overlooked and undermined

32:14.329 --> 32:18.102
by a-a lounge singer
with a degree in typing.

32:18.103 --> 32:21.342
That woman trusted us
with these clients.

32:21.343 --> 32:24.715
And we've been asked to take the
lead on the homosexual study.

32:24.716 --> 32:26.987
That's an exciting piece of research,

32:26.988 --> 32:29.692
which will yield a
paper or two or three.

32:29.693 --> 32:32.130
A year from now, our names will
be beside Masters and Johnson

32:32.131 --> 32:33.533
in respected medical journals.

32:33.534 --> 32:35.036
Why shouldn't our names
stand on their own?

32:35.037 --> 32:37.140
Especially if we are
doing most of the work?

32:37.141 --> 32:39.178
Come on, Art. You-you studied at Kinsey.

32:39.179 --> 32:40.580
You know more about homosexuality

32:40.581 --> 32:41.883
than either of them do.

32:41.884 --> 32:43.987
Why not do the study at our own clinic?

32:43.988 --> 32:47.495
Because we aren't liars or thieves.

32:51.169 --> 32:52.438
I'm not, anyway.

32:55.344 --> 32:56.947
And I'm not ready to leave the clinic

32:56.948 --> 32:59.185
when we've barely begun our tenure.

33:01.858 --> 33:04.729
And I'm not willing to put
up with as much as you are.

33:07.903 --> 33:09.171
Oh, I'm sorry.

33:09.172 --> 33:10.673
How I must look.

33:10.674 --> 33:12.511
Raccoon eyes, huh?

33:13.915 --> 33:18.423
And here I... I wanted to
take your breath away.

33:18.424 --> 33:20.226
As if I still could.

33:20.227 --> 33:22.999
Oh, I'm sure you take your
husband's breath away.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.770
Oh, he-he doesn't look at me.

33:25.771 --> 33:29.411
Or he does. He just...

33:29.412 --> 33:33.186
he doesn't see me, you know?

33:33.187 --> 33:38.196
He goes somewhere, drifts
away when I'm talking to him.

33:38.197 --> 33:41.735
So I've just... stopped.

33:42.738 --> 33:44.541
All that silver in your hair.

33:46.379 --> 33:48.649
What troubles brought that on?

33:49.652 --> 33:51.156
Have you had a happy life?

33:58.237 --> 34:00.340
I'm...

34:00.341 --> 34:04.615
I'm not sure I know how to be happy.

34:04.616 --> 34:07.855
I'm trying.

34:07.856 --> 34:09.259
Trying to learn.

34:12.063 --> 34:14.400
I need
to stop falling in love

34:14.402 --> 34:16.105
with women who don't love me.

34:16.106 --> 34:18.775
But that isn't our story.
You know that now.

34:18.777 --> 34:19.914
Ah.

34:21.449 --> 34:24.755
Is that the story of your marriage?

34:24.755 --> 34:26.159
No.

34:29.599 --> 34:32.670
No. There was someone else.

34:32.672 --> 34:34.275
Another woman.

34:35.812 --> 34:38.750
Well, I thought she didn't love me.

34:41.188 --> 34:43.592
Maybe the problem was I was thinking,

34:43.594 --> 34:45.295
"How could she possibly love me?"

34:45.297 --> 34:47.367
Oh, God.

34:47.368 --> 34:49.605
Did that uncertainty come from me?

34:52.445 --> 34:55.049
Maybe I could...

35:00.060 --> 35:03.799
Would you let me make it up to you?

35:03.800 --> 35:07.007
I'd like to try.

35:07.008 --> 35:10.446
Oh, Dody, no... uh, no.

35:10.447 --> 35:13.453
No, I-I didn't... I didn't
come here for that.

35:15.324 --> 35:16.625
I see.

35:16.626 --> 35:18.329
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

35:18.330 --> 35:20.868
You're sorry?

35:20.869 --> 35:23.305
You're sorry.

35:23.306 --> 35:24.441
Well, I'm embarrassed.

35:24.442 --> 35:25.811
No, don't be.

35:25.812 --> 35:27.447
Rejected again. No
misunderstanding this time.

35:27.448 --> 35:28.716
Don't talk like that.

35:28.717 --> 35:30.353
- I should go.
- No. Dody, please.

35:30.354 --> 35:32.725
It's okay. It's okay.

35:34.729 --> 35:37.500
I'm just a silly woman

35:37.501 --> 35:39.807
who's read too many romance novels.

35:41.743 --> 35:44.414
Good luck to you, Bill.

35:44.415 --> 35:48.689
Maybe the next woman who
wants to love you...

35:48.690 --> 35:52.098
you'll be brave enough to let her.

36:10.000 --> 36:11.069
<i>It's open.</i>

36:14.375 --> 36:17.046
So, I-I made some notes.

36:17.047 --> 36:20.353
Uh, we'll say we had three encounters.

36:20.354 --> 36:22.157
Uh, the first one when we
got back from the session.

36:22.158 --> 36:25.029
Unsuccessful, um,

36:25.030 --> 36:26.498
protracted plateau phase...

36:26.499 --> 36:28.569
although we can't say
"plateau," of course.

36:28.570 --> 36:30.239
You stayed in all night?

36:30.240 --> 36:32.110
Uh, yes.

36:32.111 --> 36:36.084
Uh, then I thought I'd say there
was a sensation of inevitability

36:36.085 --> 36:38.189
that subsided after about two minutes...

36:38.190 --> 36:40.059
I know this all sounds very technical,

36:40.060 --> 36:42.130
but we can, you know,
work on the language.

36:42.131 --> 36:44.368
You weren't alone, though, were you?

36:46.573 --> 36:48.443
You had a visitor.

36:50.380 --> 36:53.253
Uh, yeah, an old friend
dropped by last night.

36:54.388 --> 36:55.891
Dody.

36:55.892 --> 36:57.627
She lives nearby.

36:57.628 --> 37:00.733
Oh, I've never heard you
speak of her before.

37:00.734 --> 37:02.938
Well, we've only just, um,

37:02.939 --> 37:04.741
recently renewed our acquaintance.

37:04.742 --> 37:06.846
So, should we say that we
had another go around...

37:06.847 --> 37:07.781
I don't know, what do you think...

37:07.782 --> 37:09.217
about three hours later?

37:09.218 --> 37:11.288
Uh, using the lotion this time...

37:11.289 --> 37:13.627
Were you lovers?

37:15.932 --> 37:18.202
Uh, we were.

37:18.203 --> 37:20.740
- A long time ago.
- Last night?

37:20.741 --> 37:22.044
No.

37:26.319 --> 37:27.754
I don't believe you.

37:27.755 --> 37:29.157
Well, it's the truth,

37:29.158 --> 37:30.928
whether you choose to believe it or not.

37:30.929 --> 37:32.563
Why would I?

37:32.564 --> 37:36.171
The fact that you hid her
very existence from me...

37:36.172 --> 37:38.742
if it took me asking you
for you to even reveal

37:38.743 --> 37:40.746
that she stopped by...

37:40.747 --> 37:41.983
I'm not an idiot.

37:41.984 --> 37:43.820
But is she the reason why we came here?

37:43.821 --> 37:46.125
To Topeka? Because you
wanted to see her?

37:48.463 --> 37:49.865
Do you have feelings for her, Bill?

37:49.866 --> 37:53.373
Because if you do, I
think that I deserve...

37:58.951 --> 38:01.022
Oh, God.

38:03.593 --> 38:04.627
Look at me. I'm...

38:11.944 --> 38:15.316
Is this what it's like?

38:15.317 --> 38:17.420
Is this how it feels?

38:17.421 --> 38:19.925
How what feels?

38:19.926 --> 38:22.965
I'm j... I'm not...

38:22.966 --> 38:26.004
I've never been this
person before, Bill.

38:26.005 --> 38:28.977
I don't...

38:28.978 --> 38:32.951
I can't sleep, and I
stay up all night...

38:32.952 --> 38:35.623
wondering...

38:35.624 --> 38:38.997
imagining what's going on
on the other side of the wall.

38:38.998 --> 38:42.070
It's...

38:42.071 --> 38:45.310
fucking awful.

38:51.255 --> 38:54.261
How many times did I
make you feel this way?

38:57.000 --> 39:00.172
Once or twice.

39:00.173 --> 39:03.113
Or a thousand times.

39:07.454 --> 39:09.658
I'm so sorry.

39:26.225 --> 39:28.428
Ah, Ms. Masters, attorney at law.

39:28.429 --> 39:30.199
Now, I never called myself that.

39:30.200 --> 39:31.735
She may have made assumptions.

39:31.736 --> 39:34.440
Going to my wife?
Pretending to be my lawyer?

39:34.441 --> 39:36.011
- What made you think...
- That wasn't my intention.

39:36.012 --> 39:38.182
I simply called to see if
her bottom line had changed

39:38.183 --> 39:39.717
after a year of being stonewalled.

39:39.718 --> 39:42.023
I built that stone wall
very intentionally.

39:42.024 --> 39:43.525
It was hard work. You
think it wasn't part

39:43.526 --> 39:44.794
of a long-term strategy?

39:44.795 --> 39:46.131
No, Bram,

39:46.132 --> 39:49.470
I think your strategy is to punish her.

39:49.471 --> 39:52.577
Trust me. I understand.

39:52.578 --> 39:56.986
I spent ten years with a husband
who smelled of another woman.

39:56.987 --> 39:58.255
I have had the moral high ground,

39:58.256 --> 40:00.292
and the truth is knowing
you are right is

40:00.293 --> 40:01.728
the worst weapon that you can have

40:01.729 --> 40:02.797
in an argument.

40:02.798 --> 40:05.636
It makes it impossible to let go.

40:05.637 --> 40:07.506
This is why we hire attorneys...

40:07.507 --> 40:09.444
so that cooler heads will prevail.

40:09.445 --> 40:14.454
Mm? And what assets has your
cooler head secured for me?

40:14.455 --> 40:16.658
Give up the Cadillac...

40:16.659 --> 40:17.693
you never drive it...

40:17.694 --> 40:20.165
and the jade earrings.

40:20.166 --> 40:22.169
You got her to give
up the suit of armor?

40:22.170 --> 40:24.307
Hm, I subtly suggested you
couldn't possibly part

40:24.308 --> 40:26.011
with the car, so, naturally,

40:26.012 --> 40:28.282
it became the only thing
that she cared about.

40:31.222 --> 40:32.657
Screw the cooler head.

40:32.658 --> 40:34.694
You've got actual negotiating skill.

40:34.695 --> 40:36.731
It's a wonder you couldn't
settle something amicably

40:36.732 --> 40:37.733
with the diner.

40:37.734 --> 40:40.239
I don't want to be amicable.

40:40.240 --> 40:43.078
I-I realize that bringing a
$50 dentist bill to court

40:43.079 --> 40:44.314
is ridiculous.

40:44.315 --> 40:48.890
But I couldn't help but fantasize

40:48.891 --> 40:50.693
seeing myself standing in a courtroom.

40:50.694 --> 40:53.265
I mean, I sit at that
desk all day, and...

40:53.266 --> 40:54.835
and I sit in the back of rooms

40:54.836 --> 40:56.671
as wives get taken in their divorces,

40:56.672 --> 41:01.681
and the idea of standing
up in front of a judge,

41:01.682 --> 41:03.318
even in small claims court, is...

41:03.319 --> 41:05.122
Intoxicating.

41:05.123 --> 41:07.829
Completely.

41:11.035 --> 41:12.737
Have you...

41:12.738 --> 41:16.411
have you ever heard of
a woman my age, um,

41:16.412 --> 41:20.686
taking classes or going back to school?

41:20.687 --> 41:23.392
It's not common.

41:23.393 --> 41:27.734
But there's not much about you that is.

41:29.438 --> 41:31.174
Anytime between noon and four.

41:31.175 --> 41:34.680
Yes, the homosexual study
is completely anonymous.

41:34.681 --> 41:37.119
Okay. Happy to help.

41:37.120 --> 41:39.023
Boy, you've been doing a brisk business.

41:39.024 --> 41:40.259
Not a single pamphlet left.

41:40.260 --> 41:42.129
I haven't seen anyone take one.

41:42.130 --> 41:43.632
Well, they must've done it
when you weren't watching.

41:43.633 --> 41:45.804
Yeah, sadly, there's still a stigma

41:45.805 --> 41:47.540
attached to impotence.

41:47.541 --> 41:49.444
Not that I personally
have suffered from it.

41:49.445 --> 41:51.614
Don't even bother
putting those out.

41:51.615 --> 41:53.552
I threw the last batch out.
I'll throw those out too.

41:53.553 --> 41:54.720
Why would you do that?

41:54.721 --> 41:56.458
Were you listening yesterday?

41:56.459 --> 41:59.664
A penis pump is precisely the
kind of nonsense gadget...

41:59.665 --> 42:01.634
the kind of Band-Aid solution

42:01.635 --> 42:03.171
that the foundation does not condone.

42:03.172 --> 42:04.574
Well, that makes no sense.

42:04.575 --> 42:06.044
You got a broken arm,
you don't walk around

42:06.045 --> 42:07.446
with it hanging from your shoulder.

42:07.447 --> 42:09.283
A broken pecker? Why not fix it?

42:09.284 --> 42:10.719
I'm sure Bill and Virginia would agree.

42:10.720 --> 42:12.289
No. They wouldn't.

42:12.290 --> 42:14.093
And if you had any idea about
what we're doing here,

42:14.094 --> 42:15.395
you would know that.

42:15.396 --> 42:16.966
I know exactly what you're doing here.

42:16.967 --> 42:18.735
I was a part of the work before you.

42:18.736 --> 42:21.074
I was patient M0001. Remember...

42:21.075 --> 42:22.811
- I know what that is.
- You were a volunteer?

42:22.812 --> 42:24.213
I was the first volunteer.

42:24.214 --> 42:25.917
And "volunteer" isn't
even the right word.

42:25.918 --> 42:27.653
"Pioneer." That's the word.

42:27.654 --> 42:29.657
Neil Armstrong? Guy's got nothing on me.

42:29.658 --> 42:31.996
You don't think you're being
a little self-aggrandizing?

42:31.997 --> 42:33.465
One small step for man.

42:33.466 --> 42:34.835
I've been thinking about volunteering.

42:34.836 --> 42:36.437
You won't regret it.

42:36.438 --> 42:37.908
It's not just a contribution to science.

42:37.909 --> 42:39.978
It's meeting someone anonymously

42:39.979 --> 42:41.314
and connecting with them physically

42:41.315 --> 42:43.184
to see how your parts fit together,

42:43.185 --> 42:44.453
no strings attached.

42:44.454 --> 42:46.157
Well, okay, there are wires,

42:46.158 --> 42:48.161
but, man, that just heightens
the whole experience.

42:48.162 --> 42:50.465
Honestly, it was the
best sex of my life.

42:50.466 --> 42:52.469
And the first blonde
they paired me with?

42:52.470 --> 42:54.507
Oh, what a bombshell.

42:54.508 --> 42:56.144
She was... she was gorgeous

42:56.145 --> 42:57.780
and she was built, and, like,

42:57.781 --> 43:00.352
oh, God damn it, was she
ready to go, you know?

43:01.555 --> 43:02.891
Oh!

43:02.892 --> 43:05.563
You asshole! That blonde is my wife!

43:13.179 --> 43:15.248
Going over the data?

43:15.249 --> 43:17.286
Well, it's... it's very
preliminary, of course,

43:17.287 --> 43:20.626
but the homosexual couples
take a longer time

43:20.627 --> 43:23.799
in the prelude to sexual
connection, and...

43:25.303 --> 43:26.471
You going somewhere?

43:26.472 --> 43:28.843
I'm leaving early.

43:28.844 --> 43:31.816
I'm, uh, I'm going to meet
Mr. Clavermore.

43:33.653 --> 43:35.622
I turned it off.

43:35.623 --> 43:37.292
Was that a good idea?

43:37.293 --> 43:40.799
If they figure it out, they can fire me.

43:40.800 --> 43:43.038
Or I'll quit.

43:43.039 --> 43:46.644
Mr. Clavermore has found
a building for us.

43:46.645 --> 43:47.981
Since yesterday?

43:47.982 --> 43:49.818
He's had his eye on it for some time,

43:49.819 --> 43:51.889
and now he's brought his lawyer to town

43:51.890 --> 43:55.495
so we can begin to talk about
terms for a partnership.

43:55.496 --> 43:59.270
Before you say anything, let me say

43:59.271 --> 44:02.042
I know that you don't
want to leave this place,

44:02.043 --> 44:05.048
that you feel valued and fulfilled here,

44:05.049 --> 44:07.052
and I'm glad about that,

44:07.053 --> 44:10.058
because, Art, I want you to be happy.

44:10.059 --> 44:13.398
I have always wanted you to be happy.

44:13.399 --> 44:16.371
That sounds ominous.

44:18.509 --> 44:21.080
I'm gonna take this opportunity, Art,

44:21.081 --> 44:23.251
and I know you don't want to,

44:23.252 --> 44:24.653
but maybe that's okay.

44:24.654 --> 44:27.493
Maybe it's time that
we let each other go.

44:27.494 --> 44:31.902
You're... you're talking
about splitting up?

44:31.903 --> 44:33.939
I'm not happy.

44:33.940 --> 44:36.577
I haven't been for a long time.

44:36.578 --> 44:38.381
I'm sorry if this hurts,

44:38.382 --> 44:40.051
but I need to be honest with you.

44:40.052 --> 44:41.754
I'm tired of pretending.

44:41.755 --> 44:44.093
Pretending what?

44:44.094 --> 44:46.965
That I can continue to
stomach our arrangement.

44:46.966 --> 44:49.703
That I still want to be with other men

44:49.704 --> 44:52.878
and that I don't mind you
being with other women.

44:55.082 --> 44:58.154
You don't want me to
be with other women?

44:58.155 --> 44:59.825
I know that before we got married,

44:59.826 --> 45:02.563
I was the one who
insisted on this setup,

45:02.564 --> 45:05.837
but I didn't know that when you wake up

45:05.838 --> 45:07.272
with someone every morning,

45:07.273 --> 45:08.876
pour each other coffee,

45:08.877 --> 45:11.447
split the-the newspaper,

45:11.448 --> 45:14.754
that you want to go to bed with
that person every night too.

45:17.193 --> 45:19.296
You want to be monogamous.

45:19.297 --> 45:21.367
But I know that that would
be constricting for you.

45:21.368 --> 45:24.773
I know how much you love
the openness and variety

45:24.774 --> 45:26.444
that swinging brings.

45:26.445 --> 45:28.916
I love you more, Nancy.

45:28.917 --> 45:30.920
You mean you'd be willing to give up

45:30.921 --> 45:31.955
being with other women?

45:31.956 --> 45:34.059
Yes.

45:34.060 --> 45:37.666
Then this offer from Mr. Clavermore
is like Kismet.

45:37.667 --> 45:39.971
It could not be more perfectly timed.

45:39.972 --> 45:41.274
Don't you see that?

45:41.275 --> 45:43.745
We have the chance to go someplace

45:43.746 --> 45:45.448
where nobody knows us,

45:45.449 --> 45:48.621
where we don't have friends
or colleagues who think of us

45:48.622 --> 45:50.258
as-as swingers.

45:50.259 --> 45:54.099
We can make a fresh start,
the two of us together

45:54.100 --> 45:57.139
at our own clinic.

45:57.140 --> 45:58.642
In New York.

46:02.650 --> 46:04.921
I think the first
time we tried was my fault.

46:04.922 --> 46:07.592
Oh, we don't say "fault," Ingrid.

46:07.593 --> 46:10.098
I was too tentative.

46:10.099 --> 46:11.600
Did you give feedback, Earl?

46:11.601 --> 46:13.237
Tell her what felt good to you?

46:13.238 --> 46:15.775
Sometimes, if you put
your hand over hers,

46:15.776 --> 46:18.581
it allows you to direct the pace
and intensity of her stroking.

46:18.582 --> 46:23.157
Yes. I did that the second time.
And the third.

46:23.158 --> 46:25.462
So, three times?

46:25.463 --> 46:27.165
And you were able to ejaculate...

46:27.166 --> 46:28.969
Twice.

46:28.970 --> 46:31.107
Well, good job, you two.

46:31.108 --> 46:33.011
Outstanding. How do you feel?

46:33.012 --> 46:34.613
We're very encouraged.

46:34.614 --> 46:36.283
And looking forward to what's next.

46:36.284 --> 46:40.558
So, orgasmic inevitability
followed by intromission?

46:40.559 --> 46:42.329
Oh...

46:42.330 --> 46:43.798
Earl's been reading up.

46:43.799 --> 46:45.368
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Yeah.

46:45.369 --> 46:47.907
Just anxious to get
this show on the road,

46:47.908 --> 46:49.410
so to speak.

46:49.411 --> 46:52.850
Well, first things first.
It's not a show.

46:52.851 --> 46:54.720
That's the wrong way to think about it.

46:54.721 --> 46:56.557
You won't be performing for us.

46:56.558 --> 46:59.864
In fact, most couples say
after a few minutes,

46:59.865 --> 47:01.902
they completely forget we're even there.

47:01.903 --> 47:04.139
- Even where?
- In the room with us?

47:04.140 --> 47:05.642
No, no.

47:05.643 --> 47:07.112
- Of course not.
- No, no, no.

47:07.113 --> 47:08.681
- 'Cause it sounded...
- No.

47:08.682 --> 47:11.020
Marcia and I
observe you and Ingrid

47:11.021 --> 47:12.322
from behind a two-way mirror

47:12.323 --> 47:13.892
so that you can derive the benefit

47:13.893 --> 47:15.328
of our step-by-step instruction

47:15.329 --> 47:18.034
without our being too intrusive.

47:18.035 --> 47:21.073
I don't understand. I
thought that you were

47:21.074 --> 47:23.812
going to send us back to
the motel with exercises.

47:23.813 --> 47:26.885
You've made great strides
by your own account.

47:26.886 --> 47:30.058
Let's use that momentum
to take the next step.

47:30.059 --> 47:35.068
Uh, I don't think we're...
well, I'm not ready for that.

47:35.069 --> 47:36.537
I think you are, Earl.

47:36.538 --> 47:38.241
I know you are.

47:38.242 --> 47:39.409
How about you just tell us what to do,

47:39.410 --> 47:41.347
and we'll report back?

47:41.348 --> 47:43.251
But this is how
we've been able to yield

47:43.252 --> 47:45.421
the results we have in so short a time.

47:45.422 --> 47:47.225
- But other therapists...
- Frankly,

47:47.226 --> 47:49.864
they take twice as long
and charge twice as much.

47:49.865 --> 47:52.702
The process doesn't have
to be so drawn-out.

47:52.703 --> 47:55.308
In fact, we've found if
you hold up intercourse

47:55.309 --> 47:57.980
as this big event that
requires weeks of training,

47:57.981 --> 48:01.320
the psychological pressure that
causes can be very destructive.

48:01.321 --> 48:02.891
I'm sorry, but no.

48:05.162 --> 48:07.666
Fine. If it's not for
you, it's not for you.

48:07.667 --> 48:09.336
We certainly won't force you, but...

48:11.274 --> 48:14.046
If you aren't willing to
trust us or our approach,

48:14.047 --> 48:16.918
I think you have to ask yourselves,

48:16.919 --> 48:19.424
"Why did you come here
in the first place?"

48:23.131 --> 48:25.602
Honey, maybe we should discuss this.

48:25.603 --> 48:27.639
Uh, could we have a moment alone?

48:27.640 --> 48:29.543
- Certainly.
- Oh, of course. Absolutely.

48:29.544 --> 48:30.947
Take all the time you need.

48:33.252 --> 48:34.653
- It's out of the question.
- Bill.

48:34.654 --> 48:36.757
I am not going to. They...

48:36.758 --> 48:40.765
they should not be having couples...
coupling

48:40.766 --> 48:41.935
this soon, anyway.

48:41.936 --> 48:43.471
Two days into the treatment?

48:43.472 --> 48:46.277
We are not here to critique
their methodology.

48:46.278 --> 48:48.414
We're here to see what of
ours they have stolen.

48:48.415 --> 48:49.583
- And we've done that.
- So you just want

48:49.584 --> 48:51.587
- to walk away now?
- Yeah.

48:51.588 --> 48:53.457
I guarantee you we will
not be the first patients

48:53.458 --> 48:55.662
to balk at being observed...
we've seen it ourselves.

48:55.663 --> 48:58.935
We don't know if they've
co-opted our entire protocol.

48:58.936 --> 49:01.440
Uh, our questionnaire, yes.
A few exercises.

49:01.441 --> 49:03.979
But we have a very specific
technique for intromission.

49:03.980 --> 49:05.081
If they employ it, we...

49:05.082 --> 49:06.650
I... Virginia, I-I can't.

49:06.651 --> 49:10.558
We've done this countless
times before, Bill,

49:10.559 --> 49:13.664
and for a higher purpose
than our pleasure.

49:13.665 --> 49:17.472
There's nothing different now. Why...

49:17.473 --> 49:20.778
why did we come here if
not to amass enough evidence

49:20.779 --> 49:23.285
to protect our legacy?

49:24.855 --> 49:26.859
What are you afraid is going to happen?

49:29.097 --> 49:30.867
It's just sex, Bill.

49:44.127 --> 49:45.294
All by your lonesome?

49:45.295 --> 49:47.833
Art's staying late at work.

49:47.834 --> 49:49.569
What about, uh, Cissy?

49:49.570 --> 49:51.908
She's in Cincinnati for
a realtor's conference.

49:51.909 --> 49:54.413
I could open up a bottle of wine,

49:54.414 --> 49:57.153
maybe order in some Chinese.

50:14.220 --> 50:15.288
How's your hand?

50:15.289 --> 50:17.225
How's his face?

50:17.226 --> 50:19.362
I got him good, didn't I?

50:19.363 --> 50:21.200
Really felt like I connected.

50:21.201 --> 50:23.905
You did. You-you definitely did.

50:23.906 --> 50:25.741
I'm-I'm sure there's
gonna be some bruising.

50:25.742 --> 50:27.880
Or worse.

50:27.881 --> 50:29.649
I shouldn't have let him off so easy

50:29.650 --> 50:32.589
after what he said about my wife.

50:32.590 --> 50:34.493
Of course, coming from someone
with Langham's intellect,

50:34.494 --> 50:36.631
that was practically poetry.

50:38.101 --> 50:40.438
I hope you're not gonna listen to him

50:40.439 --> 50:42.509
about volunteering for the study.

50:42.510 --> 50:45.615
I just thought I'd fill in the
form, see if they take me.

50:45.616 --> 50:47.519
Oh, they'll take you.

50:47.520 --> 50:50.691
I've watched 877 couples have sex

50:50.692 --> 50:52.963
on the other side of the glass.

50:52.964 --> 50:54.666
Most of them I never saw again,

50:54.667 --> 50:56.670
so I can't say that I know
what happened to them,

50:56.671 --> 51:00.946
but some, like Langham,

51:00.947 --> 51:02.883
I know exactly what came next.

51:02.884 --> 51:05.621
It screwed him up.

51:05.622 --> 51:09.129
His marriage crashed and burned.
He lost his kids.

51:09.130 --> 51:11.935
Langham has other kids
besides the baby with Helen?

51:11.936 --> 51:14.773
Three. Four, actually.

51:14.774 --> 51:17.947
He knocked up one of the
girls in the study.

51:17.948 --> 51:19.249
That's what I'm saying.

51:19.250 --> 51:21.253
But I'm not married.

51:21.254 --> 51:23.290
And I'm definitely not
gonna get anyone pregnant.

51:23.291 --> 51:25.628
No, that... it's not just that.

51:25.629 --> 51:27.599
Ever since Jane was in the study,

51:27.600 --> 51:31.773
she treats sex like it's a performance.

51:31.774 --> 51:36.783
The curtain goes up, and she's
on stage in a starring role.

51:36.784 --> 51:40.291
Why else would she marry the man
on the other side of the glass?

51:40.292 --> 51:42.896
Because she loves you.

51:42.897 --> 51:45.067
No.

51:45.068 --> 51:47.405
Because I'm her audience.

51:47.406 --> 51:49.476
I have front row seats,

51:49.477 --> 51:52.348
a lifetime booking to her drama:

51:52.349 --> 51:56.157
crushes, affairs, breakups.

51:57.526 --> 52:01.199
I'm sorry.

52:01.200 --> 52:03.437
But you've been doing
this work for years.

52:03.438 --> 52:05.207
Y-you're telling me you
don't believe in the work?

52:05.208 --> 52:09.482
I do. I believe in the science.

52:09.483 --> 52:11.553
Just like I'm glad
there's a polio vaccine.

52:11.554 --> 52:13.959
But I wouldn't want to be the
rat that tried it first.

52:16.564 --> 52:19.669
Listen to me. Throw that away.

52:19.670 --> 52:21.573
You don't know what's real
and what's a performance

52:21.574 --> 52:23.011
when there's someone watching.

52:26.084 --> 52:31.093
Doing it behind the
glass... it changes you.

52:38.341 --> 52:40.177
Now, Ingrid, take hold of Earl

52:40.178 --> 52:43.017
and begin to manually stimulate him.

52:46.023 --> 52:49.930
<i>No. Look-look at each other.</i>

52:49.931 --> 52:51.601
Ingrid, connect with him.

52:58.148 --> 53:01.053
<i>Earl, show her
what feels good to you.</i>

53:13.044 --> 53:15.382
<i>Good. Tell her
when you're close.</i>

53:20.392 --> 53:23.097
Now, Ingrid, move over him
into female-superior.

53:31.147 --> 53:32.648
<i>Now keep hold of him,</i>

53:32.649 --> 53:36.556
<i>continuing to stimulate him</i>

53:36.557 --> 53:39.898
<i>while you put him inside you.</i>

54:43.291 --> 54:46.629
I love you.
