WEBVTT

01:16.744 --> 01:18.346
- Sir.
- What is it, Patrick?

01:18.346 --> 01:19.447
- Dispatches.

01:24.452 --> 01:27.288
- Who else has seen this?

01:27.288 --> 01:28.122
- Nobody.

01:48.442 --> 01:50.478
Speak.

01:50.478 --> 01:53.514
- Captain, a word
from the North.

01:53.514 --> 01:54.982
Go on.

01:57.017 --> 01:58.586
- The natives ambushed
William and his men

01:58.586 --> 02:00.388
on their journey home.

02:03.257 --> 02:04.258
- The count?

02:06.860 --> 02:07.695
- 17 dead.

02:10.898 --> 02:12.500
- I meant the pelt count.

02:12.500 --> 02:13.401
Any losses?

02:16.804 --> 02:18.272
- The men were found
naked and scalped.

02:18.272 --> 02:21.275
And there were no
pelts left behind.

02:23.377 --> 02:25.313
- 17 men dead, you say?

02:26.680 --> 02:28.282
- Yes, sir.

02:28.282 --> 02:30.251
When we found them, they were,

02:30.251 --> 02:33.387
animals had already begun
to pick at their flesh.

02:33.387 --> 02:34.222
- Savages.

02:36.957 --> 02:39.760
Very well, have the men
gather their carcasses

02:39.760 --> 02:41.229
and return back to camp

02:41.229 --> 02:44.398
so they can give
them a proper burial.

02:45.533 --> 02:46.934
You're dismissed.

02:49.970 --> 02:52.606
- Levi was with your son when...

02:59.847 --> 03:00.614
- Dead?

03:02.450 --> 03:03.284
- Missing.

03:14.328 --> 03:16.330
- Where did this happen?

03:18.165 --> 03:20.501
- At the foot of
the Buckskin Forest.

03:20.501 --> 03:24.071
I sent a scout team,
but with the rumors...

03:29.343 --> 03:33.146
- There is a man in camp
that cooks for the others.

03:33.146 --> 03:34.915
Wears a wolfskin cap.

03:36.216 --> 03:37.851
Do you know him?

03:37.851 --> 03:38.686
- Porter.

03:38.686 --> 03:40.153
Yes, sir.

03:40.153 --> 03:44.425
- You send word that I
wish to speak to him.

03:44.425 --> 03:45.326
- Yes, sir.

03:59.106 --> 04:00.974
- What's the news?

04:00.974 --> 04:03.844
- Take a small team
of men up North.

04:03.844 --> 04:05.946
Have them bring shovels.

04:05.946 --> 04:08.816
Dig a hole about a
hundred meters from town.

04:08.816 --> 04:12.920
When they're done, have
them show you where it is.

04:12.920 --> 04:15.789
- Baiting fox for the winter?

04:15.789 --> 04:17.725
- Digging a mass grave.

04:38.078 --> 04:38.912
Porter.

04:42.015 --> 04:44.552
- What's the point of
being alone in a church,

04:44.552 --> 04:47.321
you can't be alone in church?

04:47.321 --> 04:48.556
- My apologies.

04:49.690 --> 04:53.694
The captain would like
to speak with you.

04:53.694 --> 04:55.396
- I'll have a word
with my captain,

04:55.396 --> 04:58.298
after I'm done having
a word with my God.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.834
- I'm afraid your God can wait.

05:20.788 --> 05:22.356
- You can leave us.

05:31.599 --> 05:32.433
Sit?

05:40.774 --> 05:42.275
- You sent for me?

05:44.412 --> 05:48.248
- From what I'm told,
the men enjoy your food.

05:50.083 --> 05:53.721
- Well, I'm pleased to
hear you say that, Captain.

05:53.721 --> 05:57.391
- Tell me, how does a
trapper become a cook?

05:58.826 --> 06:01.429
- A plague that takes the
lives of both his children.

06:01.429 --> 06:05.833
And a vow to protect what
little family he got left.

06:07.267 --> 06:11.171
Then, the winters are less
harsh here in the fort.

06:16.510 --> 06:18.178
- I take it that you've heard

06:18.178 --> 06:20.881
about the men coming
home from the North?

06:20.881 --> 06:24.051
- Yeah, I just prayed
for their souls.

06:28.789 --> 06:30.624
I heard about William.

06:32.560 --> 06:33.794
My condolences.

06:36.296 --> 06:40.468
It's always difficult to
accept the loss of a son.

06:42.470 --> 06:46.239
- My son ought to have
been a general by now.

06:47.741 --> 06:52.145
It's far more difficult to
accept failure than death.

06:53.981 --> 06:56.249
- Well he died with his men.

06:56.249 --> 06:58.586
There's honor in that.

06:58.586 --> 07:03.023
- Were you aware that my
grandson, Levi, was with him?

07:12.700 --> 07:14.367
He's gone missing.

07:14.367 --> 07:16.870
And alive, dead, I don't know.

07:21.742 --> 07:23.911
- I'm sorry for your pain.

07:26.346 --> 07:29.917
Levi and my son were,
they were very close.

07:31.318 --> 07:34.822
- Josiah, You were always
loyal to the company,

07:37.891 --> 07:39.727
to the men, and to me.

07:45.198 --> 07:49.036
The others got used to
taking orders from you.

07:50.003 --> 07:52.673
You were as strong as they come.

07:54.708 --> 07:55.543
- Sir?

07:58.846 --> 08:00.714
- The Ree are ruthless.

08:01.782 --> 08:03.016
But when it comes to finding

08:03.016 --> 08:06.353
my grandson my own
resolve meets theirs.

08:08.388 --> 08:09.623
- Yeah.

08:09.623 --> 08:11.091
Perhaps you can
send a team of men

08:11.091 --> 08:12.660
up the north trails before
any winter snow blows

08:12.660 --> 08:14.094
in and covers up those tracks.

08:14.094 --> 08:16.997
- We are 17 men short
of what we were.

08:16.997 --> 08:18.799
Soon to be 18.

08:18.799 --> 08:21.301
Tell me, what men can I spare?

08:27.207 --> 08:30.644
- What is it that you
ask of me, Captain?

08:48.996 --> 08:50.664
- Your mind wanders.

08:54.768 --> 08:56.937
- I'm sorry.
- What is it?

09:03.877 --> 09:07.380
- I am to go up the
north trails tomorrow.

09:08.481 --> 09:10.083
- For what purpose?

09:11.151 --> 09:12.552
The captain's
grandson, Levi,

09:12.552 --> 09:14.688
has gone missing up there.

09:14.688 --> 09:16.256
- And he chose you?

09:17.691 --> 09:18.525
Why?

09:20.560 --> 09:23.797
- This is what he asks of me.

09:23.797 --> 09:25.999
- Why not one of the other men?

09:25.999 --> 09:27.034
Someone younger?

09:27.034 --> 09:29.837
Someone who traps for a living?

09:29.837 --> 09:33.874
- I'm going to need you to cook
for the men until I return.

09:33.874 --> 09:34.708
- Where?

09:37.811 --> 09:39.312
- Where what?

09:39.312 --> 09:41.048
- Where on the trail?

09:45.819 --> 09:47.387
The women here talk.

09:47.387 --> 09:49.156
I know those men were
ambushed at the foot

09:49.156 --> 09:50.557
of the Buckskin Woods.

09:50.557 --> 09:52.626
- They were looking
for a quicker way home.

09:52.626 --> 09:54.795
- A home they never arrived at.

09:54.795 --> 09:57.464
We both know that place is evil.

09:58.966 --> 10:02.035
At least see her before you go.

10:02.035 --> 10:03.370
Her fortune might persuade you

10:03.370 --> 10:06.874
to think twice about
the captain's orders.

10:44.111 --> 10:44.912
- Strong.

10:47.314 --> 10:48.115
Ashamed.

10:50.684 --> 10:51.651
- That was my past.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.821
I'm interested in my future.

10:55.322 --> 10:56.890
- Indeed.

10:56.890 --> 10:59.359
Many men are, but the truth...

11:01.328 --> 11:03.263
- There's a difference?

11:03.263 --> 11:04.564
- One cannot have a future

11:04.564 --> 11:07.400
without first
accepting the truth.

11:08.535 --> 11:10.704
They are one and the same.

11:40.067 --> 11:44.104
You will have a long
journey to a familiar place.

11:47.040 --> 11:50.177
A place with a past
filled with agony.

11:53.446 --> 11:54.915
The same as yours.

12:00.087 --> 12:02.689
And there is death in the trees.

12:06.693 --> 12:08.261
Blood in the water.

12:10.864 --> 12:13.633
You will not
survive the journey.

12:15.702 --> 12:18.338
- You can see my death?

12:18.338 --> 12:22.642
You will not
survive the journey.

12:22.642 --> 12:25.545
- I've survived
those woods before.

12:29.149 --> 12:32.752
- Death never makes
the same mistake twice.

12:55.075 --> 12:56.543
- First things first.

12:56.543 --> 12:57.777
If the pelts are lost,

12:57.777 --> 12:59.179
I won't go up the
trails looking for them.

12:59.179 --> 13:01.181
The deal is for
Levi, and Levi alone.

13:01.181 --> 13:02.916
Anything else is going
to add a week or so

13:02.916 --> 13:05.385
to the trip and
that's with packmules.

13:05.385 --> 13:06.653
- Understood.

13:06.653 --> 13:08.688
- Second, I'm not
winding up scalped

13:08.688 --> 13:11.058
on the edge of the riverbank.

13:11.058 --> 13:12.725
If I spot even one
native tailing me,

13:12.725 --> 13:14.928
I turn and make
back for the fort.

13:14.928 --> 13:15.762
- Agreed.

13:17.330 --> 13:18.498
- There are no
posts that far over

13:18.498 --> 13:20.367
so I'm going to be on foot.

13:20.367 --> 13:21.634
When I make it to
the woods I'm going

13:21.634 --> 13:23.436
to need both of my
hands free anyway.

13:23.436 --> 13:24.271
- All right.

13:24.271 --> 13:25.438
Anything else?

13:29.009 --> 13:31.912
- Is there some kind
of reward for this?

13:31.912 --> 13:33.346
I'd hate to leave my wife, Cora,

13:33.346 --> 13:36.183
in a bind if I wind
up lost or dead.

13:36.183 --> 13:37.184
There's $100 bonus

13:37.184 --> 13:40.053
from the Southwest Fur Company

13:40.053 --> 13:43.756
for the man that brings
my grandson home.

13:43.756 --> 13:46.226
I pray that that man is you.

14:03.977 --> 14:05.545
What news?

14:07.147 --> 14:11.618
- $100 bonus from the
Southwest Fur Company.

14:11.618 --> 14:13.253
- Not him.

14:13.253 --> 14:15.088
What was your fortune?

14:18.725 --> 14:21.361
- I didn't go see her.

14:21.361 --> 14:22.195
- Why not?

14:24.197 --> 14:28.301
- With the amount of
native blood I've spilled?

14:28.301 --> 14:30.938
- Saving that boy will
not bring ours back.

14:35.042 --> 14:36.876
- You'll be all right.

14:37.777 --> 14:39.947
Make sure you feed my men.

14:54.561 --> 14:55.996
Porter.

15:00.367 --> 15:01.634
- Henry.

15:01.634 --> 15:03.470
- You're leaving?

15:03.470 --> 15:05.072
- Yep.

15:05.072 --> 15:08.808
I got to make the best
of whatever decent
light I have left.

15:08.808 --> 15:10.310
What is it, Henry?

15:12.179 --> 15:15.882
- It's just, how
is it that you run

15:15.882 --> 15:20.020
into the forest when
others run away from it?

15:23.590 --> 15:27.127
- When my son passed,
Levi came by and visited,

15:28.795 --> 15:31.798
brought piles of
fresh cut dry wood.

15:33.800 --> 15:35.735
Nobody asked him to do it.

15:35.735 --> 15:38.405
Nobody told him, he just did it.

15:40.673 --> 15:41.574
- Godspeed.

15:43.410 --> 15:44.244
- All right.

15:44.244 --> 15:45.078
Henry?

15:46.746 --> 15:50.417
Would you look after
my wife until I return?

16:02.329 --> 16:03.830
Captain.

16:09.469 --> 16:10.970
- Leave us, Henry.

16:19.712 --> 16:21.648
- You sent word for me?

16:23.616 --> 16:25.552
- Captain.
- Excuse me?

16:27.787 --> 16:30.657
- You sent word for me, Captain.

16:30.657 --> 16:32.859
When you're in this
house you will address me

16:32.859 --> 16:35.662
by my proper name and my rank.

16:35.662 --> 16:38.265
I am positive that
I have earned it.

16:38.265 --> 16:39.099
Sit.

16:42.102 --> 16:42.935
Sit down!

16:50.143 --> 16:53.480
So the cook came to
see you, did he not?

16:55.782 --> 16:57.950
You may speak freely here.

16:59.386 --> 17:00.187
- Yes.

17:01.388 --> 17:02.222
- Captain!

17:05.258 --> 17:07.827
Yes, Captain.

17:07.827 --> 17:10.597
- And you told
him of his future?

17:11.798 --> 17:12.632
- Yes,

17:16.169 --> 17:17.003
Captain.

17:18.938 --> 17:22.709
- And what did you tell
him about his future?

17:26.045 --> 17:27.947
- I told him the truth.

17:29.616 --> 17:31.384
Which is?

17:33.253 --> 17:37.424
- I told him he would not
return from his journey.

17:44.964 --> 17:48.301
- Tell me, witch,
your father was Pawnee

17:49.536 --> 17:51.804
and your mother was white.

17:51.804 --> 17:54.807
How does one come
to do what you do?

17:56.243 --> 17:58.911
- Before my father was murdered,

18:00.580 --> 18:03.216
he taught me the Pawnee rituals.

18:04.617 --> 18:08.421
Many of which allow me
to see into one's future.

18:09.889 --> 18:10.957
- The future?

18:14.961 --> 18:17.964
- Excuse me, but I
do not understand

18:19.065 --> 18:21.634
what you want from me, Captain.

18:29.976 --> 18:34.314
- I want you to tell me
what happens to my grandson.

19:02.742 --> 19:04.977
- Why are you following me?

19:19.726 --> 19:20.560
Hello.

19:23.596 --> 19:24.531
- Howdy.

19:24.531 --> 19:27.267
I didn't mean to frighten you.

19:27.267 --> 19:29.202
- Do I look frightened?

19:29.202 --> 19:30.036
- No.

19:30.870 --> 19:32.038
No, you don't.

19:33.973 --> 19:38.411
Well actually I was just hoping
maybe I could come with you.

19:38.411 --> 19:39.812
- No.

19:39.812 --> 19:41.047
My journey is dangerous

19:41.047 --> 19:43.650
and you being the way you are,

19:43.650 --> 19:45.685
you're just going
to slow me down.

19:45.685 --> 19:48.221
You should make back for
the fort before night falls.

19:48.221 --> 19:50.957
- Well why is it I
can't be a trapper?

19:50.957 --> 19:52.925
- You're weak.

19:52.925 --> 19:55.395
I've seen animals
larger than you kill

19:55.395 --> 19:59.699
and eat other animals that
are also larger than you.

20:01.133 --> 20:02.702
- I have other skills.

20:02.702 --> 20:03.536
- Skills?

20:04.371 --> 20:05.204
Such as?

20:05.204 --> 20:06.539
- I can trap.

20:06.539 --> 20:08.341
Small animals.

20:08.341 --> 20:09.509
I can build fires.

20:09.509 --> 20:11.210
- I don't need a cook.

20:11.210 --> 20:13.480
- I can gather wood.

20:13.480 --> 20:14.314
Kindling.

20:15.448 --> 20:17.149
- I can manage myself.

20:17.149 --> 20:18.551
The answer is no.

20:36.669 --> 20:38.204
- I can't go back this soon.

20:38.204 --> 20:40.707
The men at camp
don't respect me.

20:40.707 --> 20:42.375
Okay?

20:42.375 --> 20:44.844
They just make jokes about me.

20:48.114 --> 20:52.752
They said I wouldn't survive
the night out on the trail.

20:59.292 --> 21:02.228
- I've seen many men
stronger than you go out

21:02.228 --> 21:04.697
and brave that trail and die.

21:04.697 --> 21:06.265
Or wind up missing.

21:08.100 --> 21:08.935
- Not you.

21:10.970 --> 21:14.541
And you could teach me
the art of survival.

21:22.248 --> 21:23.816
- What's your name?

21:26.152 --> 21:26.986
- Myles.

21:28.955 --> 21:32.359
- Well, Myles, why don't
you gather some wood

21:32.359 --> 21:33.593
and make us a fire.

21:33.593 --> 21:35.127
We'll make camp here tonight.

21:35.127 --> 21:37.196
But you'll head back to
the fort in the morning.

21:37.196 --> 21:38.130
All right?

21:38.130 --> 21:40.333
Tell the men I demanded it.

21:40.333 --> 21:45.004
Tell them, tell them that you
saved me from a wild boar.

21:46.739 --> 21:50.877
And when I return I will
tell them it's the truth.

21:51.811 --> 21:52.612
- Really?

21:55.247 --> 21:56.383
You'd do that?

21:57.249 --> 21:58.050
For me?

21:59.352 --> 22:00.319
Why?

22:00.319 --> 22:01.053
- Go on.

22:03.890 --> 22:04.824
- Yes, sir.

22:21.941 --> 22:23.676
So, I did good, yeah?

22:26.713 --> 22:27.547
- Yep.

22:28.748 --> 22:31.551
You keep the flames low
or surrounded with rock.

22:31.551 --> 22:36.556
That will keep the wolves at
bay if they don't see the fire.

22:37.156 --> 22:37.990
Here.

22:45.998 --> 22:49.268
Step one to surviving the trail,

22:49.268 --> 22:52.739
eat your meat without
looking at it first.

23:00.780 --> 23:02.014
So, who is she?

23:06.719 --> 23:07.554
- Huh?

23:08.755 --> 23:11.458
- The girl you're
trying to impress.

23:14.627 --> 23:17.063
- I wish it were that simple.

23:18.898 --> 23:23.736
So you're going after the
captain's grandson, yeah?

23:23.736 --> 23:25.738
That's right.

23:27.206 --> 23:31.410
I heard he might
be hiding in the Buckskin.

23:37.316 --> 23:40.987
- Do you find it hard
being the way you are?

23:43.856 --> 23:44.857
- Sometimes.

23:48.861 --> 23:51.531
Sometimes you can't do what
other young men can do,

23:51.531 --> 23:52.364
but I

23:56.168 --> 23:57.236
find purpose.

23:58.471 --> 23:59.271
- Purpose?

24:00.973 --> 24:02.041
What purpose?

24:07.346 --> 24:10.917
- It's not something easy
for a trapper to understand.

24:10.917 --> 24:13.152
- Well I'm not a
trapper anymore.

24:13.152 --> 24:14.153
Just a cook.

24:15.221 --> 24:16.055
- Yeah.

24:18.257 --> 24:22.261
Our scars only remind us
that the past was real.

24:28.968 --> 24:33.873
Before I came to Kingston, my
brothers and I lived upriver.

24:36.576 --> 24:39.411
One night the
Arikara came through.

24:39.411 --> 24:42.749
Must have been 10 of
them, on horseback.

24:44.283 --> 24:47.119
I offered them my
pelts, you know.

24:50.690 --> 24:54.694
But the Ree wanted something
else, I don't know.

25:04.203 --> 25:07.406
They held each of
us to the flame.

25:07.406 --> 25:08.340
One by one.

25:12.344 --> 25:15.615
The thing I remember
most is the smell.

25:16.683 --> 25:17.850
Burning flesh.

25:24.056 --> 25:26.392
Sometimes when I'm asleep...

25:31.097 --> 25:36.102
Do you ever wake up because
you feel like you're falling?

25:41.440 --> 25:42.274
Yeah.

25:46.278 --> 25:50.549
Sometimes I wake up feeling
like my skin's on fire.

25:56.455 --> 25:59.826
So I try to concentrate
on the things I can do

25:59.826 --> 26:02.528
rather than the
other way around.

26:07.499 --> 26:12.471
- And yet here you are
pretending to come along with me

26:12.471 --> 26:17.343
and win the favor of the other
trappers back at the fort.

26:19.812 --> 26:21.413
- Well, I am human.

26:22.782 --> 26:23.816
Yeah.

26:23.816 --> 26:26.085
- Myles, do you drink?
- Drink?

26:26.085 --> 26:29.088
- Yeah, do you want a drink?

26:30.589 --> 26:31.423
Here.

27:10.196 --> 27:11.864
- We've got company.

27:22.775 --> 27:23.776
- Gentlemen.

27:26.045 --> 27:29.515
- I heard about your
little hunt last night.

27:33.185 --> 27:35.955
- There is a white man
that hides in our trees.

27:35.955 --> 27:37.189
- On the trail?

27:40.026 --> 27:44.130
- We don't want his
stench covering our land.

27:44.130 --> 27:45.765
- Your land?

27:45.765 --> 27:46.598
All right.

27:47.734 --> 27:50.536
I guess we can call
it that for now.

27:55.341 --> 27:56.508
- What's this?

28:03.816 --> 28:07.153
- For the scalp of
the man in the woods.

28:12.558 --> 28:13.392
- Savages.

28:14.460 --> 28:16.362
- Business is business.

30:03.535 --> 30:04.971
- Drop the blade!

30:06.839 --> 30:09.008
- Drop the blade, trapper!

30:11.810 --> 30:12.644
All of it.

30:15.047 --> 30:17.649
Do you know where you're going?

30:17.649 --> 30:19.685
That there is the
Buckskin Woods.

30:19.685 --> 30:22.688
A man would be crazy
to go in there.

30:25.191 --> 30:27.793
- I'm here under Captain
Coleman's orders.

30:27.793 --> 30:28.627
- Who?

30:30.362 --> 30:32.664
- Captain Coleman.

30:32.664 --> 30:35.067
Of the Southwest Fur Company.

30:36.202 --> 30:39.771
That name
don't mean squat to me.

30:39.771 --> 30:41.908
- And who sent you?

30:41.908 --> 30:42.708
Akira?

30:43.642 --> 30:45.111
Or his dog Keokuk?

30:49.181 --> 30:52.251
I thought I smelled
cowards for hire.

30:53.152 --> 30:54.220
- Tie him up.

31:14.840 --> 31:15.674
Come on.

31:32.091 --> 31:32.925
- Water.

31:36.462 --> 31:37.296
Water.

31:39.298 --> 31:40.132
Water.

31:56.248 --> 31:59.218
- So how did you
know Akira sent us?

32:02.421 --> 32:06.658
- The man has been known to
strike deals with men like you.

32:06.658 --> 32:08.127
- Men like us?

32:08.127 --> 32:09.561
- Traitors.

32:09.561 --> 32:11.530
Woodsmen that travel
from fort to fort looking

32:11.530 --> 32:12.698
for easy coin.

32:16.502 --> 32:20.072
Whatever they promised
you, I'll double it.

32:22.408 --> 32:23.675
I'll triple it.

32:24.876 --> 32:26.478
Just get me inside
the Buckskin Woods

32:26.478 --> 32:28.814
and whenever I find
what I'm looking for,

32:28.814 --> 32:30.816
you follow me on
back to Fort Kingston

32:30.816 --> 32:32.918
and there you'll get paid
straight from the safe

32:32.918 --> 32:36.855
of Captain Coleman himself
and the Southwest Fur Company.

32:36.855 --> 32:37.789
- 10 coins?

32:39.158 --> 32:41.327
- Triple makes it 30.

32:41.327 --> 32:44.463
- What do we tell the
Indians about you?

32:44.463 --> 32:46.598
- Tell them you never found me.

32:46.598 --> 32:50.436
- They don't pay us to
come back empty handed.

32:52.404 --> 32:54.140
- This time they did.

33:00.912 --> 33:02.414
- All right.

33:02.414 --> 33:04.216
But first I want to know what
the hell you're doing going

33:04.216 --> 33:05.751
into them woods.

33:05.751 --> 33:08.020
- My business there is
none of your concern.

33:08.020 --> 33:09.888
- The hell it ain't.

33:09.888 --> 33:11.957
You know what people
say about those woods.

33:11.957 --> 33:15.694
What happens if a fellow travels
too deep into that brush.

33:15.694 --> 33:17.696
Do we got a deal or not?

33:18.564 --> 33:20.332
- I've got to piss.

33:20.332 --> 33:21.533
- Well hurry up.

33:21.533 --> 33:24.170
They're going to
be here any minute.

33:26.538 --> 33:29.608
Now what's to say we don't
go back to Fort Kingston

33:29.608 --> 33:32.544
and then you do a
dirty deal on us?

33:34.146 --> 33:36.648
- In my shooting bag
hanging from your saddle,

33:36.648 --> 33:39.218
there's a small book inside
with the terms written

33:39.218 --> 33:41.487
by Captain Coleman himself.

33:42.754 --> 33:43.589
Go on.

33:43.589 --> 33:44.423
Have a look.

33:44.423 --> 33:46.092
- All right, I will.

33:57.069 --> 34:00.206
There ain't no
Goddamned book in here.

34:31.637 --> 34:33.539
- If you're going
to call out to them,

34:33.539 --> 34:36.242
you're going to have
to yell real loud.

34:36.242 --> 34:37.075
- Ellis!

35:45.777 --> 35:46.612
- Knife.

35:52.384 --> 35:53.219
Knees.

36:06.131 --> 36:10.536
- When the blood in your
veins returns to the sea,

36:10.536 --> 36:14.139
and the earth in your bones
becomes one with the ground,

36:14.139 --> 36:16.642
perhaps then you will remember

36:18.477 --> 36:21.647
that this land does
not belong to you.

36:22.714 --> 36:25.551
It is you that
belongs to this land.

36:26.585 --> 36:27.919
- Tell me again.

36:34.125 --> 36:36.161
- The ground on which you
stand does not belong to you!

38:05.651 --> 38:06.485
- Captain.

38:07.586 --> 38:09.921
I think I see Porter coming.

38:18.530 --> 38:19.965
- Where are the others?

38:19.965 --> 38:21.667
Where are the pelts?

38:21.667 --> 38:23.569
I asked you a question.

38:28.239 --> 38:30.509
- The men are dead.

38:30.509 --> 38:34.480
And the pelts are floating
down the river as we speak.

38:34.480 --> 38:37.148
The Ree will have them
in a matter of hours.

38:37.148 --> 38:39.385
- Do you care to elaborate?

38:41.487 --> 38:43.822
- The Ree decimated the men.

38:45.190 --> 38:48.660
The shoreline of the
river's been compromised.

38:50.962 --> 38:52.898
- You have to go back in there.

38:52.898 --> 38:55.133
I need those pelts.

38:55.133 --> 38:56.802
And that's an order.

38:57.803 --> 38:58.704
- An order?

39:03.375 --> 39:06.244
If you want those
God damned pelts,

39:06.244 --> 39:09.047
you can get them yourself.

39:09.047 --> 39:11.450
My wife sent word
for me weeks ago,

39:11.450 --> 39:12.651
and I intend to be home

39:12.651 --> 39:15.721
before the first
snow falls, Captain.

39:21.026 --> 39:24.095
- What about your
fellow company men?

39:27.899 --> 39:31.570
- I made sure they
received a proper burial.

39:36.341 --> 39:39.878
- The fever spread
through the camp.

39:39.878 --> 39:41.980
Your wife fell ill.

39:41.980 --> 39:45.584
The doctors say that
she'll survive though.

39:48.654 --> 39:50.556
- Is she alive?

39:50.556 --> 39:51.389
- Yeah.

39:55.927 --> 39:57.696
- What about my children?

40:10.275 --> 40:11.943
- I'm sorry, Porter.

40:22.454 --> 40:26.357
Wesley, do you understand
what I just told you?

40:28.226 --> 40:32.297
- Captain, you tell me I
no longer have children.

46:44.735 --> 46:46.171
- It's all there.

46:49.640 --> 46:51.542
I'm not a thief.

46:51.542 --> 46:52.377
- Levi?

46:53.945 --> 46:54.779
- You ate the berries.

46:54.779 --> 46:55.613
Yes?

46:57.382 --> 46:59.150
They're hallucinogens.

46:59.150 --> 47:01.386
The Ree lace their
arrowheads with them

47:01.386 --> 47:03.221
so you can't fight back
when they put the blade

47:03.221 --> 47:04.389
to your scalp.

47:05.790 --> 47:06.624
- My map.

47:07.792 --> 47:09.527
- Some men say it
can make it seem

47:09.527 --> 47:13.731
as if entire limbs just
vanish off your body.

47:13.731 --> 47:15.266
It numbs you.

47:15.266 --> 47:18.536
If the savages find you like
that, they scalp you first.

47:18.536 --> 47:20.038
Then they cut off your man parts

47:20.038 --> 47:23.942
and hang them around their
neck as a trophy prize.

47:28.046 --> 47:29.847
- Thank you.

47:29.847 --> 47:31.282
- You're welcome.

47:32.951 --> 47:34.285
Who sent you?

47:34.285 --> 47:36.221
- Your grandfather did.

47:38.556 --> 47:41.826
We should probably
start a course home.

47:43.594 --> 47:44.429
- Home?

47:45.863 --> 47:46.697
Yeah.

47:46.697 --> 47:47.532
Home.

47:47.532 --> 47:49.367
Back to Fort Kingston.

47:51.502 --> 47:53.571
Back to your grandfather.

47:54.772 --> 47:57.375
- I haven't seen another
white man in these woods

47:57.375 --> 47:58.709
since I arrived.

48:00.912 --> 48:05.917
- Levi, whatever happened to
you out here in these woods,

48:06.517 --> 48:07.518
we cannot stay.

48:07.518 --> 48:09.554
We must go home.

48:09.554 --> 48:11.222
- Do you remember...

48:16.627 --> 48:17.862
Home.

48:17.862 --> 48:18.696
Remember?

48:25.636 --> 48:27.872
- The savages have
the river high ground.

48:27.872 --> 48:29.774
The trees to the south.

48:33.144 --> 48:34.879
- I know there's another path.

48:34.879 --> 48:36.281
I've taken it.

48:36.281 --> 48:38.216
- East?
- That's right.

48:39.784 --> 48:41.686
Through the flats.

48:41.686 --> 48:43.188
- Out in the open?

48:44.089 --> 48:45.590
You dream, mister.

48:47.025 --> 48:49.995
- Levi, the longer we stay
here, the more we get lost.

48:49.995 --> 48:52.497
You must trust me,
it's just these woods-

48:52.497 --> 48:53.331
- Expand.

48:54.632 --> 48:55.633
Yes, I know.

48:56.934 --> 49:00.205
I spent a week
walking in a circle.

49:00.205 --> 49:02.140
For someone who's
been here before,

49:02.140 --> 49:03.608
you sure don't understand
the rules the natives

49:03.608 --> 49:05.276
have for this place.

49:06.344 --> 49:07.912
- I know the rules.

49:09.047 --> 49:12.984
- Once you're in,
there's no getting out.

49:12.984 --> 49:13.818
- No.

49:15.020 --> 49:16.421
- This is where you fell ill.

49:16.421 --> 49:18.856
And this is where we are now.

49:19.690 --> 49:21.592
- That cannot be.

49:21.592 --> 49:23.261
That's a day's walk at least.

49:23.261 --> 49:25.863
- Like I said, the woods expand.

49:25.863 --> 49:27.865
They pull you in deeper.

49:33.371 --> 49:36.874
Is that why you stayed
here all this time?

49:38.043 --> 49:40.278
- My grandfather
shouldn't have sent you.

49:40.278 --> 49:41.212
Sleep.

49:41.212 --> 49:43.548
We should move at the sun.

49:43.548 --> 49:45.116
The trees whisper to the Rees.

49:45.116 --> 49:47.185
They should be here soon.

50:19.050 --> 50:20.818
- Levi, we're going
the wrong way.

50:20.818 --> 50:22.687
- Remember what I said
about the high ground?

50:22.687 --> 50:25.223
How do you expect
to go east by traveling west?

50:25.223 --> 50:28.059
- Your compass is useless here.

50:28.059 --> 50:31.262
- The sun's light is my compass.

50:31.262 --> 50:34.565
The woods may play tricks,
but to my knowledge it

50:34.565 --> 50:37.302
cannot change the direction
of the sun's light.

50:37.302 --> 50:40.171
- I don't think you understand.

50:40.171 --> 50:42.373
- No, it's you're the one
who doesn't understand.

50:42.373 --> 50:44.842
Your grandfather hired me to
find you and bring you home,

50:44.842 --> 50:48.079
and that's exactly
what I intend to do.

50:50.948 --> 50:52.617
My map says east.

50:52.617 --> 50:53.418
Not west.

50:55.019 --> 50:56.154
- Who are you?

50:59.624 --> 51:02.960
- I'm the man sent
here to save your ass.

51:04.195 --> 51:06.197
- They slaughtered them.

51:07.632 --> 51:10.568
Even the men who surrendered.

51:10.568 --> 51:13.471
They lifted their hands but
they cut off their fingers.

51:13.471 --> 51:17.242
They begged for mercy, but
they cut out their tongues.

51:17.242 --> 51:18.676
They smiled as they did it.

51:18.676 --> 51:20.178
There was so much
blood it pooled

51:20.178 --> 51:21.846
in the dirt like rainwater.

51:21.846 --> 51:24.582
I watched as they
took my father.

51:28.486 --> 51:32.423
- And you got away?
- I ran into the woods.

51:32.423 --> 51:35.025
The last of the men to
be killed saw me run.

51:35.025 --> 51:38.563
I hid in the brush and watched
as they were disemboweled.

51:38.563 --> 51:39.930
I saw my father's eyes.

51:39.930 --> 51:40.865
I swear it.

51:44.235 --> 51:49.039
He'd rather be torn to pieces
than hide in these woods.

51:49.039 --> 51:50.741
- This place is evil.

51:52.777 --> 51:57.748
These woods don't care about
pelts, furs or your heart.

51:58.516 --> 52:00.351
It wants your soul.

52:00.351 --> 52:02.220
- How do you know this?

52:03.954 --> 52:06.624
- Because it tried to take mine.

52:09.394 --> 52:10.228
Don't move!

52:13.164 --> 52:15.200
I said don't move.

52:15.200 --> 52:16.434
- I can see over the ledge.

52:16.434 --> 52:17.602
I can make it.

52:29.647 --> 52:30.481
Ree.

52:30.481 --> 52:31.649
Maybe a dozen.

52:37.488 --> 52:40.858
- Tell me more about
this path west.

52:40.858 --> 52:42.293
- It's quiet.

52:42.293 --> 52:43.561
I've never seen more
than two or three scouts.

52:43.561 --> 52:46.464
But I'm poking my
head over ledges.

52:49.534 --> 52:52.069
- And this western trail,
it somehow winds around

52:52.069 --> 52:54.004
and goes east again?

52:54.004 --> 52:56.807
- If you're trusting
the sun, yes.

53:03.648 --> 53:04.482
- Show me.

53:20.498 --> 53:21.332
Slow down.

54:02.373 --> 54:03.441
- What is it?

54:05.576 --> 54:07.077
What does it mean?

54:10.748 --> 54:13.351
- You were being hunted.

54:13.351 --> 54:14.885
- How do you know it was for me?

54:14.885 --> 54:16.421
- Who else would it be for?

54:16.421 --> 54:18.523
You said there
were native scouts?

54:18.523 --> 54:20.425
- A few here and there.

54:21.392 --> 54:22.960
- And none of them saw you?

54:22.960 --> 54:24.662
- Not that I know of.

54:24.662 --> 54:26.297
- That's not a no.

54:26.297 --> 54:29.099
And you've taken this
trail west before?

54:29.099 --> 54:30.167
- Well, yeah.

54:31.969 --> 54:33.070
What's wrong?

54:34.705 --> 54:37.408
- You never take the
same trail twice.

54:37.408 --> 54:38.576
- You didn't ask that.

54:38.576 --> 54:40.478
You asked if the western
trail leads east.

54:40.478 --> 54:43.280
- Yes, but I thought you knew
the basic rules of trapping.

54:43.280 --> 54:45.750
Now you're sending us
all over these woods.

54:45.750 --> 54:49.920
- Well we can't circle
back, so what do we do now?

54:51.456 --> 54:53.624
- We make camp for the night.

54:53.624 --> 54:55.159
We're going to lose light
soon and I don't want

54:55.159 --> 54:59.364
to be walking into a Ree
arrow again in the dark.

54:59.364 --> 55:00.164
Find wood.

55:01.466 --> 55:02.299
Go on now.

55:16.814 --> 55:18.716
- I'm starving.
- Yeah.

55:20.351 --> 55:23.421
I've never eaten an animal
this deep in the woods.

55:23.421 --> 55:24.254
- Why not?

55:25.856 --> 55:27.257
- It's forbidden.

55:29.059 --> 55:32.029
- How did you know what
those tree markings meant?

55:32.029 --> 55:34.999
- When I was littler
than you, my father used

55:34.999 --> 55:37.402
to take me up river, long trips.

55:37.402 --> 55:40.671
And I studied their
language to pass the time.

55:40.671 --> 55:42.673
- You were a trapper?

55:42.673 --> 55:46.310
- Alongside your grandfather,
if you can imagine that.

55:46.310 --> 55:49.880
That's why he
sent you to find me.

55:51.081 --> 55:53.250
- You knew my son, Josiah.

55:56.721 --> 55:59.323
You do remember my son, Josiah?

56:03.428 --> 56:05.195
- Of course.

56:05.195 --> 56:07.965
I was sad to hear
of his passing.

56:08.999 --> 56:10.000
- Yeah.

56:10.000 --> 56:12.770
He was very fond of you.

56:12.770 --> 56:15.806
He aspired to be like
you and the older boys.

56:15.806 --> 56:18.676
Almost too much at times.

56:18.676 --> 56:23.681
- Earlier you said these
woods tried to take your soul.

56:26.050 --> 56:30.455
- Levi, why is it that you
never escaped these woods?

56:32.256 --> 56:34.959
- I tried to many times.

56:34.959 --> 56:36.326
- Confusion?

56:36.326 --> 56:37.428
Feeling lost?

56:39.129 --> 56:42.633
Yeah, these woods
intend to keep you here.

56:43.768 --> 56:46.370
Make you feel that way.

56:46.370 --> 56:48.172
They intend to keep your soul.

56:48.172 --> 56:49.006
Forever.

56:50.441 --> 56:52.577
- How do you know this?

56:52.577 --> 56:55.179
- Me and 12 men coming
up the Missouri,

56:55.179 --> 56:59.183
with a large haul
after a brutal winter.

56:59.183 --> 57:01.819
The Ree caught wind of us
somewhere between the riverbank

57:01.819 --> 57:03.621
and the north trail.

57:03.621 --> 57:05.122
And by the time we
saw them coming,

57:05.122 --> 57:07.458
half the men had arrows
sticking out their asses,

57:07.458 --> 57:10.561
and their eyeballs
and their throats.

57:10.561 --> 57:13.063
And I remember looking
up in the trees

57:13.063 --> 57:17.367
and wondering how the Ree
acquired such perfect aim.

57:17.367 --> 57:19.069
The few of us that
dodged their bows

57:19.069 --> 57:21.939
were chased down into the woods.

57:21.939 --> 57:22.940
These woods.

57:24.074 --> 57:25.543
And we didn't think
much of it at the time,

57:25.543 --> 57:29.714
but one by one these
woods drove us mad.

57:29.714 --> 57:31.381
Caused us to turn on each other.

57:31.381 --> 57:36.220
When it was all said and done
I was the last man standing.

57:38.489 --> 57:39.857
Late one night, the Ree came

57:39.857 --> 57:42.927
out of the treeline
riding horses.

57:42.927 --> 57:45.596
And I'd dug a foot deep
trench and laid down in it.

57:45.596 --> 57:48.065
Covered myself in dirt and
stayed there for God knows

57:48.065 --> 57:50.901
how long until the
next day's sun.

57:53.270 --> 57:56.941
I was able to follow their
tracks out of the woods.

57:56.941 --> 58:01.879
And that's how I know these
woods don't want a man's pelt,

58:02.613 --> 58:04.048
they want a man's soul.

58:06.717 --> 58:08.185
- Did you make it home?

58:08.185 --> 58:10.187
- No.
- What did you do?

58:11.822 --> 58:12.657
- I hid.

58:13.858 --> 58:16.026
I watched the Ree closely.

58:17.427 --> 58:19.229
Whenever I could, I'd set
traps on the outskirts

58:19.229 --> 58:20.965
of these woods.

58:20.965 --> 58:22.800
It took me only three
days to round up

58:22.800 --> 58:25.202
that small group of Ree.

58:25.202 --> 58:26.571
The poor bastards were so eager

58:26.571 --> 58:28.773
to escape a few of
them tried sawing off

58:28.773 --> 58:32.076
their foot at the
ankle with sharp rocks.

58:32.076 --> 58:34.645
That's when I know it was time.

58:35.546 --> 58:37.214
- To watch them die?

58:38.849 --> 58:40.651
- I tried waiting them out.

58:40.651 --> 58:42.519
That was taking too long.

58:42.519 --> 58:44.188
So I took out my
tomahawk and began

58:44.188 --> 58:47.524
to hack them up just
as they did my men.

58:49.459 --> 58:50.561
Limb by limb.

58:52.529 --> 58:53.731
I gathered the body parts

58:53.731 --> 58:57.367
and buried them
here in these woods.

58:57.367 --> 59:00.537
This place became my own
personal burial ground

59:00.537 --> 59:04.008
for the mutilated
savages that I murdered.

59:07.411 --> 59:10.080
And when I finally made it home,

59:11.548 --> 59:15.920
both of my children had
been taken by the plague.

59:15.920 --> 59:18.022
My wife nearly
succumbed by the fever.

59:18.022 --> 59:21.291
And I swore I'd never
leave home again.

59:22.627 --> 59:25.529
I went to go see
the fortune teller,

59:25.529 --> 59:28.032
and she told me that the woods

59:29.333 --> 59:32.002
had sent a watcher home with me.

59:33.503 --> 59:35.973
And that one day he
would lead me back here

59:35.973 --> 59:37.474
to face my demise.

59:39.744 --> 59:40.745
Here we are.

59:42.446 --> 59:44.014
The Buckskin Woods.

59:46.116 --> 59:48.986
- Then why did you
agree to come back?

59:48.986 --> 59:52.790
- Because your grandfather
asked me to do so.

59:55.559 --> 59:56.994
- What was that?

59:56.994 --> 59:57.828
- Relax.

59:57.828 --> 59:59.229
- Can you see it?

1:00:00.497 --> 1:00:01.331
An Alpha.

1:00:02.767 --> 1:00:03.701
- An Omega.

1:00:06.436 --> 1:00:07.838
What was that?

1:00:07.838 --> 1:00:11.175
- That's the Alpha
putting down a challenge.

1:00:11.175 --> 1:00:12.509
- How do we know?

1:00:12.509 --> 1:00:13.911
How can we stay here?

1:00:13.911 --> 1:00:15.279
- And what would you have me do?

1:00:15.279 --> 1:00:17.882
Go chasing wolves in the dark?

1:00:17.882 --> 1:00:19.516
- The rifle.

1:00:19.516 --> 1:00:22.687
- Nobody touches
this rifle except me.

1:00:25.823 --> 1:00:27.224
- What are you doing?

1:00:28.058 --> 1:00:28.893
Stop that!

1:00:28.893 --> 1:00:29.727
Are you mad?

1:00:29.727 --> 1:00:31.662
What are you doing?

1:00:31.662 --> 1:00:32.863
- I'm being a wolf.

1:00:32.863 --> 1:00:34.098
Try it.

1:00:34.098 --> 1:00:35.900
Wolves aren't afraid
of other wolves.

1:00:35.900 --> 1:00:36.834
Go on.

1:00:36.834 --> 1:00:38.936
Let them know you're here.

1:00:43.173 --> 1:00:44.041
Yeah.

1:00:44.875 --> 1:00:45.843
Louder!

1:00:48.645 --> 1:00:49.479
See?

1:00:49.479 --> 1:00:50.314
How do you feel?

1:00:50.314 --> 1:00:51.515
Better?

1:00:51.515 --> 1:00:52.649
- Like a wolf.

1:00:53.583 --> 1:00:54.418
- Yeah.

1:00:54.418 --> 1:00:55.686
My son loved wolves.

1:00:55.686 --> 1:00:57.654
Always wanted to be one.

1:01:02.793 --> 1:01:03.728
Come on now.

1:01:03.728 --> 1:01:04.661
That sounds like a chicken.

1:01:04.661 --> 1:01:05.930
Let me hear a wolf!

1:01:21.211 --> 1:01:22.913
What direction is this?

1:01:22.913 --> 1:01:24.548
- West.

1:01:24.548 --> 1:01:25.916
East.

1:01:25.916 --> 1:01:27.084
West, I think.

1:01:28.252 --> 1:01:30.120
- What direction
does the sun set?

1:01:30.120 --> 1:01:31.588
- The west.

1:01:31.588 --> 1:01:34.024
- Then why are we headed north?

1:01:34.024 --> 1:01:34.859
- North?

1:01:36.827 --> 1:01:38.295
- Look.

1:01:38.295 --> 1:01:40.564
That there is the same
tree we passed yesterday.

1:01:40.564 --> 1:01:41.766
- Impossible.

1:01:41.766 --> 1:01:44.468
We've
circled back around!

1:01:45.702 --> 1:01:47.337
- Are you all right?

1:01:48.672 --> 1:01:51.441
- We've lost two days walking.

1:01:51.441 --> 1:01:54.644
Taking this western
trail of yours.

1:01:54.644 --> 1:01:55.479
- No.

1:01:55.479 --> 1:01:56.680
Not that.

1:01:56.680 --> 1:01:58.749
Your eyes, they're watering.

1:02:02.686 --> 1:02:03.520
- Strange.

1:02:07.457 --> 1:02:08.292
- Take it off!

1:02:08.292 --> 1:02:09.126
Your clothes.

1:02:09.126 --> 1:02:10.094
Remove all of it, now!

1:02:16.066 --> 1:02:17.134
- What is it?

1:02:19.469 --> 1:02:22.039
- Remember those berries
I told you about?

1:02:22.039 --> 1:02:23.573
Like I said, you've
been poisoned.

1:02:23.573 --> 1:02:24.408
- What?

1:02:24.408 --> 1:02:25.242
How?

1:02:25.242 --> 1:02:26.676
- I don't know.

1:02:26.676 --> 1:02:28.145
You must have brushed up
against a branch or something.

1:02:28.145 --> 1:02:29.713
- What's happening?

1:02:31.081 --> 1:02:31.916
I need to go get water.

1:02:31.916 --> 1:02:33.150
Stay here.

1:03:35.946 --> 1:03:36.780
Shhh.

1:03:38.715 --> 1:03:39.549
Ree.

1:03:40.918 --> 1:03:41.919
- How many?

1:03:41.919 --> 1:03:44.054
- Less than six.

1:03:46.690 --> 1:03:48.758
- We can't stay here.

1:03:48.758 --> 1:03:49.593
- Don't move.

1:03:49.593 --> 1:03:51.161
It's still healing.

1:03:55.765 --> 1:03:56.833
They're gone.

1:04:03.941 --> 1:04:04.841
- My rifle.

1:04:06.877 --> 1:04:08.212
Where is it?

1:04:08.212 --> 1:04:10.814
- I left it back near the trail.

1:04:10.814 --> 1:04:11.949
- You left it?

1:04:11.949 --> 1:04:13.083
Why?

1:04:13.083 --> 1:04:14.351
- You were burning up.

1:04:14.351 --> 1:04:16.954
I didn't have time
to return for it.

1:04:16.954 --> 1:04:20.024
Just where do you
think you're going?

1:04:22.126 --> 1:04:24.261
- I'm going to get my gun.

1:04:24.261 --> 1:04:25.362
The brush
is full of spies.

1:04:25.362 --> 1:04:27.297
You'll never make it.

1:04:27.297 --> 1:04:30.500
- Just how far do you think
we're going to get without it?

1:04:30.500 --> 1:04:33.337
- Your wound isn't fully healed.

1:04:33.337 --> 1:04:34.571
You're risking your life.

1:04:34.571 --> 1:04:35.405
Our lives.

1:04:37.807 --> 1:04:41.645
- If you don't want to
go, then you stay here.

1:05:04.834 --> 1:05:05.835
Where is it?

1:05:07.337 --> 1:05:09.139
- It was right
here when we left.

1:05:09.139 --> 1:05:10.607
- Without a rifle we
can't fight anyone off

1:05:10.607 --> 1:05:12.576
without getting close.

1:05:12.576 --> 1:05:13.877
- Maybe the Ree took it.

1:05:13.877 --> 1:05:15.545
They're tracking us-

1:05:17.714 --> 1:05:18.615
What is it?

1:05:29.126 --> 1:05:31.228
- How is it that I was stuck,

1:05:31.228 --> 1:05:34.664
yet none of my clothing
has been pierced?

1:05:35.932 --> 1:05:37.634
I asked you a question!

1:05:37.634 --> 1:05:40.370
How is it that I got stuck?

1:05:40.370 --> 1:05:41.605
- I don't know.

1:05:42.572 --> 1:05:43.773
- You don't know?

1:05:43.773 --> 1:05:45.275
Just like you don't
know where my rifle is?

1:05:45.275 --> 1:05:48.845
Just like this path west by
some magic leads east somehow?

1:05:48.845 --> 1:05:51.015
- I saved your life twice.

1:05:54.418 --> 1:05:55.585
- Look at you.

1:05:57.154 --> 1:06:00.024
I've been sent out here to
rescue the prodigal son.

1:06:00.024 --> 1:06:04.361
And all he has to say is
that he saved my life twice.

1:06:05.795 --> 1:06:06.630
- Where are you going?

1:06:06.630 --> 1:06:07.564
- Home.
- Home?

1:06:07.564 --> 1:06:08.398
Yes.

1:06:08.398 --> 1:06:09.666
Back to Fort Kingston.

1:06:09.666 --> 1:06:12.636
- We can still make
for home together.

1:06:12.636 --> 1:06:14.271
- You don't want to go home.

1:06:14.271 --> 1:06:15.739
You belong to these woods now.

1:06:15.739 --> 1:06:16.973
And ever since we've
started you been

1:06:16.973 --> 1:06:19.376
leading me around
in one giant circle.

1:06:19.376 --> 1:06:21.845
And I didn't come out here
against my wife's wishes

1:06:21.845 --> 1:06:23.480
to get lost and die at the hands

1:06:23.480 --> 1:06:25.915
of these savages for nothing.

1:06:32.622 --> 1:06:34.724
Well it looks like I did.

1:06:35.659 --> 1:06:38.428
- We're lost!
- You're lost.

1:07:29.413 --> 1:07:30.314
We made it.

1:07:38.054 --> 1:07:38.955
This is it.

1:07:43.193 --> 1:07:44.094
What is it?

1:07:47.197 --> 1:07:48.132
What is it?

1:07:50.967 --> 1:07:55.972
- I was the one who stuck you
in the woods, while you slept.

1:07:58.208 --> 1:08:00.177
I also buried the rifle.

1:08:02.746 --> 1:08:04.748
- Why would you do that?

1:08:04.748 --> 1:08:07.617
- Because they made me do it.

1:08:07.617 --> 1:08:08.452
- Who?

1:08:08.452 --> 1:08:09.253
The Ree?

1:08:12.722 --> 1:08:14.658
Who talks to you, Levi?

1:08:15.559 --> 1:08:16.960
- I cannot leave.

1:08:18.328 --> 1:08:22.999
- Levi, your father died
trying to escape these woods.

1:08:22.999 --> 1:08:24.434
- I cannot leave.

1:08:30.274 --> 1:08:33.710
- Levi, if you go back in
those woods you are never going

1:08:33.710 --> 1:08:35.945
to come out the same again.

1:08:37.281 --> 1:08:39.716
- Says the man that
made it out alive.

1:08:39.716 --> 1:08:40.550
- Yeah.

1:08:42.085 --> 1:08:43.587
But it changed me.

1:08:44.821 --> 1:08:46.423
Changed me from
the man I once was,

1:08:46.423 --> 1:08:49.493
and you don't want
that for yourself.

1:08:50.694 --> 1:08:51.995
Think of Josiah.

1:08:53.363 --> 1:08:56.099
I lost him because I
was here in these woods

1:08:56.099 --> 1:08:58.702
instead of at home next to him.

1:08:59.969 --> 1:09:03.407
I never got to hold
his hand as he passed.

1:09:07.110 --> 1:09:09.679
You don't remember him, do you?

1:09:13.350 --> 1:09:15.519
Then it's you that's lost.

1:09:16.986 --> 1:09:20.790
- If you'd stayed, he'd
still be alive today.

1:09:20.790 --> 1:09:24.294
You traded your life for
his, don't you see it?

1:09:24.294 --> 1:09:26.563
- I see, believe me, I see!

1:09:30.900 --> 1:09:32.802
- If you loved your son,

1:09:32.802 --> 1:09:35.805
you should have
stayed in the woods.

1:09:38.408 --> 1:09:41.077
- Levi, step out onto the trail.

1:09:46.950 --> 1:09:48.618
- You killed Josiah!

1:09:52.622 --> 1:09:53.890
- Levi, please.

1:09:56.025 --> 1:09:58.428
Just step out of those woods.

1:10:05.435 --> 1:10:06.703
- Stay with me.

1:10:08.738 --> 1:10:11.341
- You're not thinking straight.

1:10:12.542 --> 1:10:15.011
Levi, come out here
where I can see you

1:10:15.011 --> 1:10:18.081
and we can make a
path home together.

1:10:19.683 --> 1:10:20.517
Levi!

1:11:58.281 --> 1:12:00.216
- Stay with me.

1:12:00.216 --> 1:12:01.885
- No chance.

1:12:01.885 --> 1:12:03.920
You made your decision.

1:12:03.920 --> 1:12:05.455
I'll tell Captain
Coleman his grandson

1:12:05.455 --> 1:12:07.791
was dead when I arrived.

1:12:07.791 --> 1:12:09.626
- That would be a lie.

1:12:10.794 --> 1:12:11.695
- So be it.

1:12:13.129 --> 1:12:14.998
- You'll not
survive the journey!

1:12:14.998 --> 1:12:16.199
That's what the fortune teller

1:12:16.199 --> 1:12:19.068
told you before
you left, isn't it?

1:12:20.003 --> 1:12:22.138
- Goodbye, Levi.

1:12:22.138 --> 1:12:23.840
- Fucking coward!

1:12:23.840 --> 1:12:27.711
Last time you left these woods
your son and daughter died.

1:12:27.711 --> 1:12:29.646
Who's the only one left to take?

1:12:29.646 --> 1:12:31.114
Your wife?

1:12:31.114 --> 1:12:32.649
Cora?

1:12:32.649 --> 1:12:36.185
- That isn't you in
there, Levi, I know it.

1:12:36.185 --> 1:12:38.187
- There's a deal on the table.

1:12:38.187 --> 1:12:39.789
Your life for mine.

1:12:43.126 --> 1:12:44.861
- And you trust them?

1:12:45.929 --> 1:12:46.763
The Ree?

1:12:48.131 --> 1:12:49.132
The watcher?

1:12:52.869 --> 1:12:55.338
- Makes sense it's
you they want.

1:12:55.338 --> 1:12:58.174
It's you they've always wanted.

1:12:58.174 --> 1:13:00.744
In a way you created this place.

1:13:05.915 --> 1:13:09.218
- I didn't come out
here to fight you, Levi.

1:13:09.218 --> 1:13:10.954
I came out here to help you.

1:13:10.954 --> 1:13:13.256
- I don't want your help.

1:13:13.256 --> 1:13:15.492
One way or another you're
coming back with me.

1:13:15.492 --> 1:13:18.562
They won't allow
you to escape again.

1:13:20.997 --> 1:13:24.568
- If you want me, then
you come and get me.

1:13:39.282 --> 1:13:41.084
- That's more like it.

1:13:41.084 --> 1:13:43.553
- It doesn't have
to end this way.

1:13:43.553 --> 1:13:45.054
- End?

1:17:00.316 --> 1:17:02.551
- What is it, Henry?

1:17:02.551 --> 1:17:07.456
Sir, they, they found
Porter's body on the trail.

1:17:08.391 --> 1:17:09.225
I'm sorry.

1:17:10.694 --> 1:17:11.527
- Levi?

1:17:16.199 --> 1:17:18.868
- He said the Ree took his life.

1:17:37.120 --> 1:17:39.956
What will you have
me do, Captain?

1:17:47.063 --> 1:17:48.464
- Nothing, Henry.

1:17:50.934 --> 1:17:53.136
I was told of this day.
