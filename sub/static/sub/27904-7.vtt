Old Spice, my secret weapon.

00:18.192 --> 00:19.628
Oh-ho-ho.

00:19.671 --> 00:21.673
She's a lucky lady.

00:21.717 --> 00:26.330
Andi, prepare yourself
for some good old-fashioned...

00:26.374 --> 00:27.462
Teddy.

00:29.507 --> 00:32.293
Surprise, he's
in our bed again.

00:32.336 --> 00:34.512
I see that and I love it.

00:34.556 --> 00:36.993
But, uh...

00:37.037 --> 00:39.430
buddy, you've been sleeping
in here for two weeks.

00:39.474 --> 00:41.258
Made your own little dent
in the mattress.

00:42.607 --> 00:45.001
Well, he can't
sleep on his own

00:45.045 --> 00:47.830
because somebody let him
watch Nightmare on Elm Street.

00:49.310 --> 00:50.963
Okay, look, I know
we talked about this,

00:51.007 --> 00:52.313
but I am still not convinced

00:52.356 --> 00:53.923
that's why he can't
sleep by himself.

00:53.966 --> 00:55.794
Hmm.

00:55.838 --> 00:57.535
What else could have
happened two weeks ago

00:57.579 --> 00:59.146
to scare the bejesus
out of Teddy?

01:00.712 --> 01:05.108
I switched to two percent
milk, that's pretty spooky.

01:05.152 --> 01:06.675
No, it was the movie.

01:06.718 --> 01:09.025
Okay.Honey, don't
worry about it.

01:09.069 --> 01:10.896
Go get your pillow.

01:12.898 --> 01:15.466
I estimate we have
30 seconds, okay?

01:15.510 --> 01:17.294
Unless he brushes his teeth.

01:17.338 --> 01:18.469
Ted-Teddy!

01:18.513 --> 01:20.341
Brush your teeth!

01:20.384 --> 01:22.212
Okay, we have
35 seconds.

01:22.256 --> 01:23.648
It's not a race.

01:23.692 --> 01:25.911
Well, it can be.
It's been two weeks!

01:25.955 --> 01:27.348
Okay, listen.

01:27.391 --> 01:29.698
No, no, no,
listen, listen.

01:29.741 --> 01:31.352
I said he was too
young for that movie

01:31.395 --> 01:32.744
but you went rogue.

01:32.788 --> 01:33.876
Yeah.

01:33.919 --> 01:36.008
You made your bed and now

01:36.052 --> 01:37.880
we all get to lie in it.

01:37.923 --> 01:39.577
With Teddy.

01:40.883 --> 01:43.538
Wait, wait, wait, we
still have ten seconds.

01:43.581 --> 01:45.148
We can make this happen.

01:45.192 --> 01:46.889
If you follow my instructions
very carefully...

01:50.545 --> 01:53.113
What a waste
of Old Spice.

02:00.946 --> 02:04.689
What is wrong with this... bag?

02:04.733 --> 02:07.649
Why won't it open?

02:07.692 --> 02:09.651
Why don't bags open anymore?

02:10.826 --> 02:13.742
This bag is broken.

02:13.785 --> 02:15.047
Adam.

02:18.138 --> 02:20.140
You seem troubled.

02:20.183 --> 02:24.144
I'm fine, it's... it's private.

02:24.187 --> 02:26.320
Yeah, stay out
of the man's business.

02:26.363 --> 02:29.453
He hasn't made love
to his wife in 15 days.

02:29.497 --> 02:32.195
That's not true.
How do you know that?

02:32.239 --> 02:33.979
Marcy told me.

02:34.023 --> 02:36.808
After we made love.

02:38.636 --> 02:41.639
We have a heck
of a streak going.

02:41.683 --> 02:44.816
And I'll tell you,
the sky looks a little bluer.

02:46.209 --> 02:48.124
Well, since
it's public information...

02:48.168 --> 02:50.953
I let Teddy watch
a scary movie

02:50.996 --> 02:53.173
and he's been in
our bed ever since.

02:53.216 --> 02:55.958
Now I'm starring in my own
horror movie and it's rated G.

02:57.612 --> 02:59.570
I haven't had
intimate relations

02:59.614 --> 03:01.442
since Jen and I split up.

03:01.485 --> 03:03.270
But I'm not complaining,
I have new interests.

03:03.313 --> 03:05.620
I'm learning Mandarin.

03:05.663 --> 03:07.752
That means,
"I'm lonely."

03:10.755 --> 03:13.889
Let's just keep our bedroom
problems to ourselves, okay?

03:13.932 --> 03:17.632
I don't need anyone else
knowing my private business.

03:17.675 --> 03:20.156
Your mother tells me
you're in a slump, son.

03:23.028 --> 03:24.595
Mom knows?

03:24.639 --> 03:26.641
Well, my guess is you're
overthinking things.

03:26.684 --> 03:27.990
Just relax, boy.

03:28.033 --> 03:30.514
See the ball,
hit the ball.

03:31.646 --> 03:33.648
It's not a slump.
It's a drought.

03:33.691 --> 03:36.085
My swing is just fine.

03:36.128 --> 03:38.827
You say "tomato," I say
you're not getting any.

03:42.961 --> 03:45.921
Look, the problem's
not me and Andi.

03:45.964 --> 03:48.663
It's all the little people
that live with us.

03:48.706 --> 03:50.969
One of life's cruel jokes:

03:51.013 --> 03:52.797
the more kids you have,
the less time there is

03:52.841 --> 03:54.669
to do the thing
that makes kids.

03:56.061 --> 03:58.325
Well, you know
what you should do?

03:58.368 --> 03:59.587
Take Andi to a hotel.

03:59.630 --> 04:01.502
No kids, a little romance.

04:01.545 --> 04:03.199
That's actually
a great idea.

04:03.243 --> 04:04.679
Andi loves hotels.

04:04.722 --> 04:06.724
It reminds her of our honeymoon,
when she was already

04:06.768 --> 04:08.683
in a good mood,
'cause she got me.

04:08.726 --> 04:11.294
Hey, Dad, can you
watch the kids?
Sure.

04:11.338 --> 04:13.427
I love having my little
beer grabbers around.

04:15.820 --> 04:19.041
How come you never ask me
or Marcy to watch the kids?

04:19.084 --> 04:20.912
Where are your keys right now?

04:22.914 --> 04:24.351
That's why.

04:24.394 --> 04:26.875
Come on, I'm serious.

04:26.918 --> 04:28.224
You never even consider us.

04:28.268 --> 04:29.269
I love those kids.

04:29.312 --> 04:31.619
Well, that's nice
to hear, Don.

04:32.924 --> 04:34.883
And since Dad just called them
"little beer grabbers,"

04:34.926 --> 04:36.101
I guess you win.

04:37.755 --> 04:39.191
That's all right.

04:39.235 --> 04:41.585
I still have your mother,
the original beer grabber.

04:44.849 --> 04:48.592
How would you like
to be whisked... away

04:48.636 --> 04:51.378
by your loving husband
to a hotel room

04:51.421 --> 04:55.382
complete with...
a loving husband?

04:55.425 --> 04:58.385
You're so sweet.Hmm? Yeah.

04:58.428 --> 05:01.257
But we can't.
What? Why?

05:01.301 --> 05:02.911
Well, hotels cost money.

05:02.954 --> 05:05.522
Until we sell that flip house,
we are carrying two mortgages.

05:05.566 --> 05:06.828
I already thought of that.

05:06.871 --> 05:09.483
I have a gift card.

05:11.180 --> 05:12.486
Don't worry, baby.

05:12.529 --> 05:14.488
I won't spend
a dime on you.
Aw.

05:16.577 --> 05:19.275
Wait, this is the hotel
that gave us a free night

05:19.319 --> 05:20.494
'cause they had bedbugs.

05:20.537 --> 05:21.930
Mm.

05:21.973 --> 05:23.366
You saw one,

05:23.410 --> 05:24.976
and freaked out and the
next thing I knew,

05:25.020 --> 05:26.369
you were in the
glass elevator naked,

05:26.413 --> 05:27.588
riding down to the lobby.

05:29.590 --> 05:31.853
I had my underwear.

05:31.896 --> 05:33.942
In your hand.

05:35.030 --> 05:36.988
And I apologized
to that wedding.

05:37.032 --> 05:39.208
But the hotel
just reopened,

05:39.251 --> 05:41.341
so it'll never be cleaner.

05:41.384 --> 05:42.646
Just like when
a restaurant reopens

05:42.690 --> 05:44.213
after a rat problem-- ooh.

05:44.256 --> 05:46.911
By the way, I have a gift card
for dinner, too.

05:59.271 --> 06:01.230
So, your dad and I
have to go away for a night.

06:01.273 --> 06:02.623
Oh, what for?

06:02.666 --> 06:06.148
We got to take care
of a little business.

06:06.191 --> 06:07.410
What kind of business?

06:07.454 --> 06:09.412
None of your
business business.

06:09.456 --> 06:12.110
So, you, Teddy and Emme
are gonna be staying

06:12.154 --> 06:13.373
with Uncle Don
and Aunt Marcy.

06:13.416 --> 06:15.462
Or...

06:15.505 --> 06:16.811
I think I'm old enough now

06:16.854 --> 06:19.161
to stay home by myself
for one night.

06:19.204 --> 06:20.467
What do you say?

06:20.510 --> 06:21.729
Okay.
No.

06:23.557 --> 06:24.862
BOTH:
Pantry.

06:26.995 --> 06:28.997
Okay.

06:29.040 --> 06:30.955
We are not leaving
Katie here by herself;

06:30.999 --> 06:32.304
she can't be trusted.

06:32.348 --> 06:34.002
She's got our DNA.

06:34.045 --> 06:37.440
Our beer-chugging,
mechanical bull-riding DNA.

06:37.484 --> 06:40.487
She gets good grades,
she's responsible,

06:40.530 --> 06:42.140
she's a good girl.

06:42.184 --> 06:44.621
We had a golden retriever
growing up that was a good girl.

06:44.665 --> 06:46.884
You know what she did
every time we left her alone?

06:46.928 --> 06:48.320
Jumped the fence
and got pregnant.

06:48.364 --> 06:51.498
She's having a tough time
at school, all right?

06:51.541 --> 06:53.064
Her best friend moved away.

06:53.108 --> 06:55.327
She hasn't found
a new social circle yet.

06:55.371 --> 06:57.895
Look, she wants this; let's
just do something nice for her.

06:57.939 --> 07:01.246
We give her food and clothes
every single day.

07:02.639 --> 07:05.947
All right, let me ask you this:
what do you want more?

07:05.990 --> 07:09.211
To win this Kate thing,
or hotel sex?

07:09.254 --> 07:12.214
I vote for hotel sex.
I'm a single-issue voter, okay?

07:12.257 --> 07:15.173
Katie, great news.

07:16.653 --> 07:18.307
Okay, so Teddy and Emme
are at Uncle Don's...

07:18.350 --> 07:19.700
Okay, everyone knows
where everyone is.

07:19.743 --> 07:21.528
Blow some kisses.
No time to waste.

07:21.571 --> 07:24.226
Uh, hey.

07:24.269 --> 07:26.489
Would it be okay if I invited
Shelby and Winslow over?

07:26.533 --> 07:29.797
The two old guys
from The Muppets?

07:29.840 --> 07:32.887
No. They're girls
from my Spanish class.

07:32.930 --> 07:34.932
But I'm thinking I might
get to know them better

07:34.976 --> 07:35.977
if we hang out.

07:38.109 --> 07:40.155
You-you can
hang out tomorrow, okay?

07:40.198 --> 07:41.678
Nobody but you here tonight.

07:41.722 --> 07:43.419
You invite someone over,
they invite more people.

07:43.463 --> 07:46.640
Next thing you know, I got
Burning Man in my living room.

07:46.683 --> 07:48.772
You in the house, just you.

07:48.816 --> 07:50.644
Sitting around, doing nothing.

07:50.687 --> 07:52.428
Have fun. I love you.

07:55.083 --> 07:56.345
Honey,

07:56.388 --> 07:57.868
just between you and me,

07:57.912 --> 08:00.001
go ahead and have
those girls over.

08:00.044 --> 08:02.046
But Dad just said...Don't worry about Dad.

08:02.090 --> 08:03.526
He's got other things
on his mind.

08:05.615 --> 08:07.356
Come on.

08:07.399 --> 08:09.619
Would you please come on?
I've got ideas.
Okay.

08:21.631 --> 08:23.459
Howdy, cowboy.

08:23.503 --> 08:26.549
Ooh, Old West prostitute.
I like it.

08:26.593 --> 08:29.030
No, no, I'm a pioneer woman.

08:29.073 --> 08:32.424
Yeah, farming the land
to feed our 12 children.

08:32.468 --> 08:34.557
Let's just be ourselves.

08:34.601 --> 08:36.559
It's been 15 days.
It'll seem new.

08:36.603 --> 08:39.214
Later, we should
raid those minibar snacks.

08:39.257 --> 08:40.432
They're complimentary.

08:40.476 --> 08:42.217
Well, if we do this thing right,

08:42.260 --> 08:44.393
you won't be awake
for minibar snacks.

08:44.436 --> 08:46.047
Mm-hmm.

08:53.184 --> 08:54.403
What is it?

08:56.361 --> 08:57.798
I started thinking about
those bedbugs.Oh...

08:59.016 --> 09:00.757
I think this might be
the same room

09:00.801 --> 09:02.324
that we had last time.

09:02.367 --> 09:04.369
It's got the same floor plan:
bed, window, TV.

09:04.413 --> 09:08.330
It's a hotel room.
They all have that floor plan.

09:08.373 --> 09:10.811
Right. Right.

09:14.597 --> 09:17.861
It-It's like I can
feel bugs on me.

09:19.254 --> 09:20.821
Those things drink blood.

09:20.864 --> 09:23.345
And what if one of 'em
bites me there?

09:23.388 --> 09:24.868
That's where all the blood
will be.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.655
Everything's gonna be fine.
All right?

09:28.698 --> 09:32.310
Now, mosey on over here,
partner.

09:33.790 --> 09:35.444
Come on.

09:39.056 --> 09:41.276
I-I can't do it,
I'm sorry.

09:42.407 --> 09:45.454
Hey, Teddy is at Don
and Marcy's.

09:45.497 --> 09:47.369
That means our bed is empty.

09:47.412 --> 09:48.631
Le-Let's just go home.

09:48.675 --> 09:49.763
You want to go home?

09:49.806 --> 09:51.808
I'll make it just like
a hotel, okay.

09:51.852 --> 09:53.201
I'll put chocolates
on the pillow,

09:53.244 --> 09:56.683
and in the morning, we
can steal our own shampoo.

09:56.726 --> 09:58.380
Okay, yeah, that--

09:58.423 --> 10:01.035
Let me just text Kate
and warn her-- tellher

10:01.078 --> 10:02.558
that we're coming home.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.212
Good, good, great.
I am out of here.

10:04.255 --> 10:05.387
Adam.
Hmm?

10:05.430 --> 10:07.389
Glass elevator.

10:07.432 --> 10:08.999
Right. Pants.

10:18.095 --> 10:19.488
My dad's coming.
Everybody out!

10:19.531 --> 10:20.663
Go, go! Get out!

10:20.707 --> 10:22.752
Out, out, out, out.
Go, go, go, go!

10:37.941 --> 10:39.334
Oh, my...!

10:55.742 --> 10:57.613
Hi.

10:57.657 --> 10:59.441
Hey, Mom.

10:59.484 --> 11:01.269
There's my girl.

11:01.312 --> 11:05.360
All alone, like I knew
you would be.

11:05.403 --> 11:07.275
Okay. Hey, Katie,
we're very tired,

11:07.318 --> 11:09.364
so we're just gonna
go straight up to bed.

11:09.407 --> 11:10.582
Okay.

11:12.846 --> 11:14.717
I never got
my minibar snacks.

11:18.155 --> 11:19.809
This room's taken, bro.

11:30.385 --> 11:33.693
Katie, there were teenagers
canoodling in our pantry.

11:35.738 --> 11:37.261
How did this happen?

11:37.305 --> 11:39.873
It doesn't matter
how it happened.

11:42.353 --> 11:44.094
We don't even need
to know what anybody said

11:44.138 --> 11:45.792
that might've led up to it.

11:46.880 --> 11:48.533
I want to know.

11:48.577 --> 11:50.231
She had a party.

11:50.274 --> 11:52.189
The one thing I
told her not to do.

11:52.233 --> 11:53.625
It wasn't a party.

11:53.669 --> 11:55.366
Oh, it wasn't a party?

11:55.410 --> 11:57.455
Well, then you won't mind

11:57.499 --> 11:59.762
if I check the trash
outside for evidence, huh?

12:00.981 --> 12:03.070
Huh? This house looks
a little too clean.

12:03.113 --> 12:05.289
I've been living with your
mother for a long time...

12:05.333 --> 12:06.682
Hey.

12:14.516 --> 12:16.300
Wait!

12:17.649 --> 12:20.957
Before you do that,
I should tell you.

12:21.001 --> 12:23.351
A neighbor came by...

12:23.394 --> 12:24.961
and he asked if he could

12:25.005 --> 12:28.008
dump his beer cans
into our trash.

12:30.010 --> 12:33.100
And... then he said
he was moving away

12:33.143 --> 12:34.666
so we'll never see him again.

12:38.018 --> 12:40.020
Oh, Katie.

12:41.586 --> 12:43.719
Oh-ho-ho, Katie.

12:46.069 --> 12:48.550
Okay, fine.
There was a party.

12:48.593 --> 12:50.247
But I didn't drink anything.

12:50.291 --> 12:52.554
And I only invited
two girls over.

12:52.597 --> 12:54.382
The others heard about it
and showed up.

12:54.425 --> 12:57.080
Which is exactly what
I told you would happen

12:57.124 --> 13:00.431
and why I said you couldn't
have anybody over.

13:03.086 --> 13:04.609
You're grounded.

13:04.653 --> 13:06.046
Grounded?

13:08.004 --> 13:09.353
Mom said I could!

13:13.531 --> 13:15.272
What? I--

13:18.667 --> 13:20.800
Oh, Andi.

13:28.155 --> 13:29.243
What's up?

13:29.286 --> 13:31.811
That is an excellent
question, Teddy.

13:31.854 --> 13:33.682
What is up?

13:34.683 --> 13:35.858
Teddy's scared.

13:35.902 --> 13:37.294
He wants to sleep
in here with us.

13:37.338 --> 13:39.514
But we have a streak.

13:39.557 --> 13:41.690
Well, I guess
the streak is over, honey.

13:43.387 --> 13:45.172
Teddy, let's go
for a ride.

13:51.526 --> 13:52.701
Hey, munchkins.

13:52.744 --> 13:54.834
What a nice surprise.

13:54.877 --> 13:57.880
I see you, Donny.

13:57.924 --> 13:59.577
You went behind my back

13:59.621 --> 14:01.449
and decided to
parent on your own.

14:01.492 --> 14:03.190
You went rogue.

14:03.233 --> 14:05.148
You went rogue, too,

14:05.192 --> 14:06.846
when you let Teddy
watch a scary movie.

14:06.889 --> 14:09.065
Wh...

14:09.109 --> 14:12.329
This is completely different.

14:12.373 --> 14:15.942
I explicitly said Katie
couldn't have anybody over.

14:15.985 --> 14:19.336
And I explicitly said that Teddy
shouldn't watch that movie.

14:19.380 --> 14:21.861
Yeah, but I wasn't listening.

14:24.037 --> 14:26.866
Plus, Teddy is the only one
in his class who hadn't seen it.

14:26.909 --> 14:28.215
I was right.

14:28.258 --> 14:30.347
Well, I think I was right.But you were wrong.

14:30.391 --> 14:33.655
I never told Kate
to have a party.

14:33.698 --> 14:35.483
I just wanted her
to make some friends.

14:35.526 --> 14:38.529
Oh, people were making
friends, all right.

14:38.573 --> 14:41.184
Some teenager was stealing
second base in our pantry!

14:41.228 --> 14:43.708
Where we keep our food.

14:44.318 --> 14:46.711
Contaminated, Andi!

14:53.109 --> 14:54.502
What's that?

14:54.545 --> 14:56.330
I signed Emme up
for boxing.

14:56.373 --> 14:58.680
You said no, but since
we're going rogue,

14:58.723 --> 15:00.595
I'm doing it anyway.

15:00.638 --> 15:03.728
Oh. Fine with me.
Mm.

15:03.772 --> 15:06.340
I'll sign Teddy up for
rhythmic gymnastics class.

15:06.383 --> 15:07.732
You know that's
the Olympic event

15:07.776 --> 15:09.996
where they dance around
twirling the ribbons.

15:10.039 --> 15:11.388
Great.

15:11.432 --> 15:14.696
Then I'll call the gym
about Emme. Yeah.

15:14.739 --> 15:17.003
I can't wait to watch her
spit a tooth into a bucket.

15:17.046 --> 15:18.700
Terrific.

15:18.743 --> 15:20.006
Good. Yep.

15:20.049 --> 15:22.095
You have your athlete,
I have mine.

15:22.138 --> 15:23.966
See you at the Olympics.

15:25.098 --> 15:28.014
Hey, we just came
to drop off the kids.

15:28.057 --> 15:29.580
Why do you have
Teddy and Emme?

15:29.624 --> 15:32.714
Uncle Don ding-dong-ditched us
on their porch.

15:32.757 --> 15:35.935
It was awesome. We got
Grandpa, like, four beers.

15:38.633 --> 15:40.026
Did we come at a bad time?

15:40.069 --> 15:41.984
I can always tell
when a wife's mad.

15:42.028 --> 15:44.900
If you're fighting,
we'll wait in the driveway.

15:44.944 --> 15:46.467
We-we can hear
everything from there.

15:46.510 --> 15:50.036
We're not fighting,
we're having a disagreement.

15:50.079 --> 15:54.301
Oh, doesn't surprise me.
We know all about your drought.

15:54.344 --> 15:56.433
Ma, that's not
what this is about.

15:56.477 --> 16:00.481
Your daughter-in-law organized
a teenage orgy in our pantry.

16:01.656 --> 16:03.658
Adam's just mad
because I told Kate

16:03.701 --> 16:06.008
it was okay to have friends
over, and a party happened.

16:06.052 --> 16:10.795
Oh, so what? You and Don always
had parties when we left town.

16:10.839 --> 16:12.058
What? No, we didn't.

16:12.101 --> 16:13.973
The hell you didn't!
There were more beers

16:14.016 --> 16:16.236
in the fridge when we
got home than when we left.

16:16.279 --> 16:20.414
That's because
this weird neighbor

16:20.457 --> 16:22.372
would sometimes bring beers over

16:22.416 --> 16:24.592
and we would put them
in the fridge for you.

16:24.635 --> 16:27.551
And then he moved away,
so you can't ask him.

16:27.595 --> 16:31.903
Was it Sal? Or Daryl? That seems
like something he would do.

16:31.947 --> 16:34.080
He's making it up, Bev.

16:34.123 --> 16:35.820
The point is, Andi,

16:35.864 --> 16:38.301
we are supposed to
parent together,

16:38.345 --> 16:41.043
and she went rogue.He went rogue first.

16:41.087 --> 16:43.959
Well, that's a different story.
Nobody likes that.

16:44.003 --> 16:46.440
I had to lay down the law
with your mother in '79

16:46.483 --> 16:48.529
when she took you...Don't you finish
that sentence, Joe.

16:48.572 --> 16:49.747
You took Adam

16:49.791 --> 16:52.359
to get a perm after
I told you not to.

16:52.402 --> 16:53.795
You're darn right I did.

16:53.838 --> 16:56.841
Oh, you looked like
one of The Jackson 5.

16:57.973 --> 17:00.715
His hair was so big,
a bird got stuck in it.

17:00.758 --> 17:02.760
Hold on, hold on,
I have an important question.

17:03.979 --> 17:06.068
You had a perm?

17:06.112 --> 17:07.983
No.

17:08.027 --> 17:11.943
Stop talking. This family
talks too much. Goodbye.

17:11.987 --> 17:14.729
He wanted to express himself,
and I supported him.

17:14.772 --> 17:16.339
No father should
see his son

17:16.383 --> 17:19.212
under a beauty shop hair dryer
reading Good Housekeeping.

17:26.306 --> 17:28.917
Can't believe a word they say.

17:28.960 --> 17:31.746
Well, it makes me feel better

17:31.789 --> 17:35.793
that we're not the first parents
arguing about this stuff.

17:35.837 --> 17:39.406
It probably goes all the way
back to the Old West.

17:40.972 --> 17:43.845
Ain't that right, Sheriff?

17:50.417 --> 17:53.811
Well, I reckon so.

17:55.161 --> 17:56.510
Madam Prostitute.

17:58.512 --> 18:02.777
I'm a pioneer woman.
Sheesh. Let it go.

18:02.820 --> 18:06.389
Fine, fine, fine.

18:06.433 --> 18:07.564
Maybe for our anniversary.

18:09.523 --> 18:13.353
I... I'm sorry for going
behind your back with Teddy.

18:13.396 --> 18:15.833
Me, too, with Kate.

18:15.877 --> 18:18.967
Going rogue is a bad idea.You're right.

18:19.010 --> 18:20.708
So we're not gonna
do that anymore, right?

18:20.751 --> 18:22.797
Right.

18:27.236 --> 18:30.631
Well, there's hundreds
of scary movies,

18:30.674 --> 18:32.807
and I'm too afraid
to watch them alone.

18:34.287 --> 18:36.158
We'll go
case by case.

18:36.202 --> 18:37.986
Fair enough.

18:40.075 --> 18:43.034
Hey, you got any pictures
of you with that perm?

18:43.078 --> 18:44.862
No. No.

18:44.906 --> 18:47.169
No, I burned them all.

18:47.213 --> 18:51.217
That's too bad. You might
get lucky if you did.

18:51.260 --> 18:53.436
I know exactly where one is.

19:00.226 --> 19:02.837
Morning, fellas.

19:05.709 --> 19:08.364
What a day, huh?

19:10.453 --> 19:14.718
Have you ever seen
a sky that blue?

19:17.547 --> 19:20.202
Well, somebody sure
has cheered up.

19:20.246 --> 19:22.204
Yeah, worked
everything out.

19:22.248 --> 19:23.771
Instead of grounding Katie,

19:23.814 --> 19:27.166
her punishment is Teddy
has to sleep in her room.

19:28.384 --> 19:32.171
So in the parents'
room, well,

19:32.214 --> 19:34.085
let's just say

19:34.129 --> 19:36.958
there's a new sheriff in town.

19:39.003 --> 19:40.831
Yeah, well, my streak is over.

19:40.875 --> 19:43.834
Marcy said choosing sex
over family is a turnoff.

19:45.706 --> 19:48.448
And then she started listing
all the other things I do

19:48.491 --> 19:50.624
that are turnoffs.

19:50.667 --> 19:53.017
It was a real bad night.

19:55.150 --> 19:56.673
Well, you have my sympathies.

19:56.717 --> 19:59.415
As a single man, I understand
how hard celibacy can be.

19:59.459 --> 20:00.808
Here.

20:00.851 --> 20:02.113
Let me help you with that.

20:07.162 --> 20:09.295
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

20:09.338 --> 20:10.600
Take it easy, buddy.

20:12.950 --> 20:15.649
Some guys just can't
handle a drought.
