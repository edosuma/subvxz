WEBVTT

00:05.589 --> 00:06.590
Open two.

00:10.469 --> 00:11.637
Move forward.

00:13.931 --> 00:15.224
You want him to come this way?

00:15.307 --> 00:16.808
Yeah. Right there.

00:22.439 --> 00:23.732
I got this one.

00:23.815 --> 00:24.858
Yes, sir.

00:28.570 --> 00:30.864
I got a thing for celebrities.

00:49.383 --> 00:51.760
Kuvney will tell you who this is for.

00:54.721 --> 00:55.722
He's good to go.

01:24.626 --> 01:26.003
You okay?

01:27.921 --> 01:29.298
The code worked.

01:29.965 --> 01:31.967
I translated the diary.

01:35.220 --> 01:38.849
It's not easy to hear.

01:39.266 --> 01:40.267
Why?

01:42.769 --> 01:44.688
Chuck was molesting Lanie.

01:47.357 --> 01:48.442
What?

01:49.776 --> 01:50.944
No.

01:51.028 --> 01:52.446
She never told you?

01:52.529 --> 01:53.530
No.

01:54.406 --> 01:57.409
Did you ever suspect anything like that?

02:01.830 --> 02:03.332
Wait, so you...

02:04.750 --> 02:07.961
think that she killed Chuck because of it?

02:10.380 --> 02:14.218
I think that Erin didto protect her daughter.

02:16.053 --> 02:21.892
And I think that she coached Lanieinto identifying you.

02:26.855 --> 02:28.857
Erin always hated me.

02:30.025 --> 02:31.860
I never knew why.

02:35.364 --> 02:37.699
Rivalry with my mother.

02:39.576 --> 02:45.624
Did she act suspiciously before the partyin the weeks leading up?

02:48.961 --> 02:51.588
She wasn't really around.

02:53.090 --> 02:57.010
She was gone for, like, a monththat September before Halloween.

02:59.721 --> 03:00.722
A month?

03:04.393 --> 03:05.394
Yeah.

04:33.482 --> 04:36.151
<i>Warren, I know you hate my guts.</i>

04:36.818 --> 04:38.695
<i>Maybe you didn't even open this letter.</i>

04:39.821 --> 04:42.908
<i>You probably chucked itas soon as you saw it was from me.</i>

04:45.202 --> 04:46.745
<i>I wouldn't blame you.</i>

04:47.246 --> 04:50.374
<i>Did you see my return address?You know what that means?</i>

04:51.708 --> 04:53.919
<i>I'm locked up just like you.</i>

04:54.002 --> 04:57.047
<i>Sometimes knowing thatis the only thing that keeps me going.</i>

04:57.840 --> 04:59.675
<i>It makes me feel a little better.</i>

05:03.428 --> 05:05.848
<i>I'm not asking you to be my pen pal.</i>

05:05.931 --> 05:07.933
<i>I just want you to know that I'm scared.</i>

05:08.016 --> 05:09.476
<i>That I'm all alone too.</i>

05:10.727 --> 05:14.189
<i>Sometimes I wish I could be locked awayuntil I die just like you.</i>

05:15.482 --> 05:17.526
<i>I don't wanna go backto the real world now.</i>

05:17.609 --> 05:19.695
<i>There's nothing left for me there.</i>

05:19.778 --> 05:21.363
Now you'll never forget me.

05:21.780 --> 05:23.532
<i>I wonder if you feel the same.</i>

05:25.617 --> 05:28.245
<i>I love you. Don't write back.</i>

05:28.328 --> 05:29.955
<i>Love, Lanie.</i>

05:55.856 --> 05:57.649
Don't worry, almost there.

06:02.154 --> 06:03.906
Okay, take it off.

06:14.208 --> 06:15.542
It's our old place.

06:15.626 --> 06:17.044
Remember?

06:17.878 --> 06:21.173
Oh, man, I used to dream about this spotwhen I was in New York.

06:21.882 --> 06:25.511
Which is a little weird 'cause we haven'tbeen here since I was, like, nine.

06:25.594 --> 06:28.388
But... come on! Sit.

06:34.353 --> 06:35.354
Wow.

06:36.939 --> 06:40.192
Well, you have been so supportive

06:40.275 --> 06:43.529
through whatever this is with Caleb,

06:43.612 --> 06:46.365
so I've decided to stay for a bit longer.

06:46.448 --> 06:47.616
You can stay with us.

06:48.367 --> 06:50.744
Really. For as long as you want.We would love to have you.

06:50.827 --> 06:52.079
Thanks.

06:55.374 --> 06:56.583
I'll get it.

07:27.739 --> 07:29.449
Go away, Josie.

07:37.666 --> 07:38.876
<i>Josie!</i>

07:39.459 --> 07:40.919
Josie, are you okay?

07:42.671 --> 07:43.797
Are you okay?

07:47.801 --> 07:51.513
-Hey, hey.-Hey. What's up, my ladies of mayhem?

07:52.389 --> 07:53.932
I come bearing gifts.

07:54.016 --> 07:56.727
And the best kind too:the gift of knowledge.

07:56.810 --> 07:58.812
Erin Buhrman was arrestedfor drunk driving.

07:58.896 --> 07:59.980
Hardly a surprise.

08:00.063 --> 08:01.565
But this is the interesting part.

08:01.648 --> 08:04.318
Went to court-ordered rehabin August of 1999.

08:04.401 --> 08:08.238
She got out in September and was homea month before Chuck was murdered.

08:08.322 --> 08:11.533
Her alibi was that she was drunk andpassed out, slept through the whole thing.

08:11.617 --> 08:13.744
But if she was fresh outta rehab,

08:13.827 --> 08:16.705
she might've been sober that nightand lying to the police.

08:16.788 --> 08:18.165
That's a big "if."

08:18.248 --> 08:21.084
I know a lot of alcoholics that,as soon as they get out of rehab,

08:21.168 --> 08:23.086
the first thing they dois head straight to the liquor store.

08:23.170 --> 08:26.131
So, we visit the rehabto see if that sobriety stuck.

08:27.841 --> 08:31.595
They found you guilty in absentia,which triggered the arrest warrant,

08:31.678 --> 08:33.096
but we took care of it.

08:33.179 --> 08:34.932
-That's it?-That's it.

08:35.515 --> 08:36.850
Well, I owe you one.

08:38.644 --> 08:41.188
Maybe I'll take you shopping,spice you up a little bit.

08:41.980 --> 08:45.692
Can I ask you a questionabout Poppy in foster care?

08:45.776 --> 08:48.445
-With Miss Shirley?-Yes, who was she exactly?

08:48.529 --> 08:50.906
Shirley Maxwell.She's one of those neighborhood aunties.

08:50.989 --> 08:51.990
Poppy stayed with her.

08:52.074 --> 08:53.450
The three of you were separated?

08:53.534 --> 08:56.286
Me and Desiree went to Daddy's cousin.

08:56.370 --> 08:59.915
Poppy was there for a year. She makes itsound like she was breaking rocks for ten.

09:00.332 --> 09:01.458
A year?

09:02.376 --> 09:03.627
Thank you.

09:10.175 --> 09:11.176
Need anything?

09:13.220 --> 09:17.474
Yeah. Get me what you canon a Shirley Maxwell.

09:17.558 --> 09:20.686
Oakland resident. Around 1979, 1980.

09:20.769 --> 09:21.812
No problem.

09:28.110 --> 09:34.199
<i>Trying to figure out clues to a crimethat happened 19 years ago isn't easy.</i>

09:35.701 --> 09:38.704
But you know who the unsung heroes are?You.

09:39.830 --> 09:41.206
<i>The listeners.</i>

09:41.290 --> 09:43.917
<i>The people out there diggingfor the answers,</i>

09:44.001 --> 09:45.502
<i>trying to find out the truth.</i>

09:47.337 --> 09:49.381
<i>So how do you help the people stay sober?</i>

09:49.464 --> 09:53.427
Well, we normally connect themwith a high quality sober coach

09:53.510 --> 09:55.012
and provide outpatient AA meetings.

09:55.095 --> 09:59.600
The New Soul Rehab Center won't discloseinformation about past clients.

09:59.683 --> 10:05.439
Say I'm using Erin Buhrman as an exampleof a type of patient.

10:06.148 --> 10:09.985
Well, for that type of patient,I'd say JoAnna Diaz.

10:10.861 --> 10:15.574
And that type of patientmight have used JoAnna multiple times

10:15.657 --> 10:16.658
throughout the years.

10:16.742 --> 10:20.829
<i>An anonymous source confirmedErin Buhrman stayed at New Soul</i>

10:20.913 --> 10:23.290
<i>and led us to her sober coach.</i>

10:23.373 --> 10:25.042
<i>What can you tell me about Erin Buhrman?</i>

10:25.125 --> 10:27.628
<i>She was stone-cold soberwhen she called me in a rage</i>

10:27.711 --> 10:30.088
<i>about her husband making eyesat some neighbor that night,</i>

10:30.506 --> 10:32.090
<i>but she was on Antabuse.</i>

10:32.174 --> 10:33.634
<i>What's Antabuse?</i>

10:33.717 --> 10:36.011
It's a drug that makes you throw upif you drink alcohol.

10:36.762 --> 10:38.847
Was she on it the night of the murder?

10:38.931 --> 10:42.893
If Erin was sober the night of the murder,why did she lie to the police?

10:43.519 --> 10:44.853
What is Erin hiding?

10:44.937 --> 10:49.316
And is this the reasonWarren was sent to prison?

11:23.308 --> 11:25.811
What the hell are you doing down here?

11:29.439 --> 11:30.649
Hey.

11:34.152 --> 11:36.864
I didn't see anything.I didn't see anything.

11:37.531 --> 11:40.284
Well, what was there to see?

11:42.536 --> 11:43.537
Nothing.

11:49.960 --> 11:54.173
Who are you... without me?

11:58.302 --> 11:59.344
Tell me.

12:00.846 --> 12:01.847
Say it.

12:04.308 --> 12:05.350
Nothing.

12:06.810 --> 12:08.145
I'm nothing.

12:19.281 --> 12:20.616
You took me.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.702
You "protected me."

12:25.162 --> 12:29.833
Whose face do you think I seewhen I go to bed at night?

12:29.917 --> 12:31.835
You motherfucker.

12:34.463 --> 12:37.549
And you call that a "family"?

13:30.519 --> 13:36.525
Ella, honey, why am I the one in hereputting your toys away?

13:37.359 --> 13:38.819
'Cause you're the daddy.

13:39.236 --> 13:42.072
That's right. I'm the daddy. Yeah.

13:45.158 --> 13:47.286
No. Lanie's not here.

13:47.369 --> 13:49.538
This is about your mother-in-law,not Lanie.

13:49.621 --> 13:51.582
I think she's the key to Chuck's murder.

13:53.834 --> 13:56.879
You're an outsider.You've probably noticed some things.

13:56.962 --> 13:58.338
I can't help you.

13:58.422 --> 14:00.257
You want Erin out of your life?

14:00.340 --> 14:02.009
Your life back with Lanie?

14:02.092 --> 14:05.262
Then help me fill in the gaps,get closer to Erin.

14:09.683 --> 14:10.726
Okay.

14:14.271 --> 14:18.192
We had to bail her out of jailthe week she came home.

14:18.275 --> 14:20.903
-What?-She broke into their old house.

14:20.986 --> 14:22.571
The house they grew up in.

14:22.654 --> 14:25.199
And, well, the new owners,they called the police.

14:36.084 --> 14:37.377
-Hey.-Yeah?

14:37.461 --> 14:39.087
-Kuvney?-Ain't see him.

14:40.214 --> 14:41.423
Where's Kuvney?

14:48.013 --> 14:49.348
Cave.

14:54.311 --> 14:55.979
You seen Kuvney around?

14:58.148 --> 14:59.233
No.

15:00.859 --> 15:02.653
When was the last time you saw him?

15:04.404 --> 15:05.405
Yesterday.

15:06.365 --> 15:07.491
Really?

15:09.326 --> 15:10.494
You sure?

15:11.328 --> 15:12.329
Yeah.

15:14.331 --> 15:15.332
Why?

15:25.968 --> 15:27.511
-Here we go.-What the hell?

15:27.594 --> 15:30.514
It's the O.J. effect. Human nature.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.599
All of this because of the podcast.

15:36.937 --> 15:38.522
We bought it four years ago.

15:38.605 --> 15:41.567
We knew the history going in.It was never a problem for us.

15:41.650 --> 15:42.734
Until your podcast.

15:47.656 --> 15:48.949
Chuck's office.

15:53.036 --> 15:55.080
Just show us where you found Erin.

15:58.292 --> 16:01.128
So, we came home from our dinnerand found her down here.

16:02.671 --> 16:06.717
She'd snuck in through a bathroom windowthat wasn't connected to our alarm system.

16:08.385 --> 16:11.138
Yeah. A lot of houses like that.

16:12.598 --> 16:15.017
This is not the first oneshe's broken into.

16:16.935 --> 16:18.020
Where exactly was she?

16:18.103 --> 16:19.396
In here.

16:19.479 --> 16:21.356
So, what did she do when you found her?

16:21.440 --> 16:23.734
She laughed and apologized.

16:23.817 --> 16:27.237
Said that she stopped bybecause she was feeling nostalgic.

16:28.238 --> 16:29.573
It was creepy as shit.

16:29.656 --> 16:32.492
-Was there anything missing? Stolen?-Zero.

16:32.576 --> 16:34.369
Hey, Poppy, check this out.

16:38.832 --> 16:41.335
Hey, was this like thatbefore she got here?

16:42.211 --> 16:43.754
-I don't think so.-No.

16:46.673 --> 16:48.425
She was looking for something.

16:49.384 --> 16:50.552
The murder weapon?

16:50.636 --> 16:51.845
Was never found.

16:51.929 --> 16:55.224
If she was looking for money or jewelry,she would have come after it years ago.

16:55.307 --> 16:57.684
So she kills Chuck,hides the knife before the cops come,

16:57.768 --> 16:59.019
goes about her business,

16:59.102 --> 17:02.314
then comes back for it 'cause she's afraidyou're gonna figure out she did it.

17:02.397 --> 17:04.566
For 20 years nobody's talked about this.

17:04.650 --> 17:08.278
You mention it on your podcastand now she has to come back.

17:08.362 --> 17:09.363
Cover her tracks.

17:09.445 --> 17:12.616
Except she never got it. There was nothingon her when she was arrested.

17:12.699 --> 17:14.034
This is money, Poppy.

17:14.117 --> 17:15.743
You gotta work her hard.

17:17.204 --> 17:20.207
Erin won't give me anything.She's too smart for that.

17:20.874 --> 17:24.252
But she is nervous and impulsive.

17:24.336 --> 17:26.128
So we get her to make a move.

17:26.213 --> 17:27.214
How?

17:28.131 --> 17:29.508
We smoke her out.

17:34.763 --> 17:35.848
Check him.

17:39.601 --> 17:41.812
<i>Lockdown. All prisoners, lockdown.</i>

17:42.312 --> 17:43.313
On the ground.

17:55.409 --> 17:59.705
<i>Erin suspected, but she suspectedany woman that came into Chuck's orbit.</i>

17:59.788 --> 18:01.665
<i>You believed Erin's alibi?</i>

18:14.595 --> 18:16.138
Yeah, hello? Hello?

18:16.221 --> 18:17.472
<i>Ms. Buhrman, this is Tim.</i>

18:17.973 --> 18:20.434
<i>I think we foundwhat you were looking for.</i>

18:20.517 --> 18:22.227
<i>Why don't you come by the house?</i>

18:24.438 --> 18:26.523
Let's go. Yep.

18:28.483 --> 18:29.610
Yo, that's for you, man.

19:06.688 --> 19:09.066
Hey, it's Warren.

19:11.443 --> 19:13.070
I need to see you...

19:15.405 --> 19:17.032
before it's too late.

19:19.117 --> 19:20.452
Please come.

19:37.302 --> 19:38.595
Let's hear it.

19:38.679 --> 19:41.473
We found what you were looking forwhen you broke in here.

19:41.890 --> 19:43.809
Found it deep in the old furnace.

19:44.476 --> 19:45.477
Yeah?

19:45.561 --> 19:48.313
Five grand and it's yoursor we go to the police.

19:49.064 --> 19:50.315
I'd like to see it first.

19:50.399 --> 19:52.192
When we see the cash.

19:52.276 --> 19:53.861
Describe it to me, asshole.

19:55.320 --> 19:56.780
It was a knife.

19:58.448 --> 19:59.658
Nice try.

20:01.535 --> 20:02.578
<i>She just walked away.</i>

20:02.661 --> 20:05.497
-You did exactly what Poppy said to?-Yes.

20:05.581 --> 20:07.666
Thank you, guys. You were perfect.

20:09.710 --> 20:10.711
She didn't bite.

20:11.295 --> 20:15.424
I never expected her to.But the woman is definitely guilty.

20:15.507 --> 20:16.508
Based on what?

20:16.592 --> 20:20.262
She showed up. And now we knowwe're not looking for a knife.

21:10.479 --> 21:11.605
Why'd you call me?

21:12.481 --> 21:14.650
I didn't think you'd actually show.

21:18.654 --> 21:20.239
I needed to see you.

21:23.408 --> 21:24.618
Get rid of it.

21:25.327 --> 21:26.620
Get rid of what?

21:27.454 --> 21:28.789
Hating you.

21:30.749 --> 21:32.501
I'm gonna die in here.

21:42.803 --> 21:44.471
Do you remember this?

21:48.684 --> 21:50.060
I didn't think you got it.

21:50.894 --> 21:52.396
I know it by heart.

21:57.526 --> 22:00.320
Only one thing made me keep it.

22:03.240 --> 22:04.616
Is it true?

22:05.367 --> 22:06.827
Is what true?

22:07.411 --> 22:09.580
You told me you loved me.

22:11.915 --> 22:13.292
Was it true?

22:18.547 --> 22:19.548
Warren...

22:19.631 --> 22:23.677
"I don't want to go backto the real world now.

22:25.971 --> 22:28.265
There's nothing left for me there.

22:33.395 --> 22:36.023
I wonder if you feel the same.

22:37.441 --> 22:40.903
I love you. Don't write back.

22:42.154 --> 22:45.324
Love, Lanie."

22:47.993 --> 22:52.331
Just tell me. Please.

22:55.083 --> 22:56.710
Was it true?

22:57.419 --> 22:59.046
Nothing I say...

23:00.422 --> 23:02.257
can help you.

23:07.554 --> 23:08.722
Warren...

23:09.932 --> 23:11.433
Don't.

23:13.977 --> 23:18.649
"If you live through this with me..."

23:24.029 --> 23:26.532
"...I swear that I would die for you."

23:43.757 --> 23:45.717
You should've told me...

23:47.886 --> 23:49.555
about your father.

23:50.347 --> 23:52.057
What he was doing to you.

23:58.981 --> 24:03.610
So you think you--You think you know everything?

24:05.445 --> 24:08.490
You think you have the missing pieceto the whole mystery now?

24:08.574 --> 24:09.575
Lanie.

24:14.329 --> 24:19.126
If I had known,I would've killed him myself.

24:30.721 --> 24:32.181
Warren.

24:33.849 --> 24:35.184
You know...

24:36.894 --> 24:41.899
you're still the only girlI have ever kissed.

24:49.948 --> 24:51.783
You are still--

24:56.496 --> 24:59.833
You are still the only boy I ever loved.

25:04.129 --> 25:05.130
Okay.

25:08.175 --> 25:10.385
Then why did you lie about me?

25:19.019 --> 25:21.480
Lanie. Lanie, Lanie. Lanie!

26:52.613 --> 26:54.198
Siri, call Desiree.

26:54.281 --> 26:55.574
<i>Calling Desiree.</i>

26:56.325 --> 26:57.701
<i>Hey, Poppy.</i>

26:57.784 --> 27:01.079
Hey. Did I leave Mama's fanafter church on Sunday?

27:01.747 --> 27:03.123
<i>I haven't seen any.</i>

27:04.124 --> 27:06.585
Okay. Thanks.

27:13.884 --> 27:14.885
Don't lecture me.

27:14.968 --> 27:18.639
Honestly, Mom,I just came to check the mail,

27:19.473 --> 27:21.183
and I find you drunk on the floor.

27:21.266 --> 27:26.188
I do really wanna be kind here,so just don't make me regret it.

27:26.271 --> 27:27.523
You sound like your sister.

27:30.192 --> 27:34.696
Lanie told me that Caleb left you.What will you do?

27:34.780 --> 27:36.240
I don't know yet.

27:36.823 --> 27:38.367
I tried to protect you.

28:04.726 --> 28:07.312
I think I'm gonna stay in Menlo Parkfor a while.

28:07.855 --> 28:08.856
Good.

28:10.774 --> 28:12.818
It'll be good for your sister.

28:13.402 --> 28:15.571
Maybe I could come home for Christmas.

28:15.654 --> 28:16.697
You're leaving?

28:18.073 --> 28:19.408
It's time.

28:20.576 --> 28:22.077
Why don't you stay?

28:23.495 --> 28:27.499
You could take the timeto clean yourself up, you know?

28:28.166 --> 28:29.293
Start over.

28:35.424 --> 28:40.512
I left you guys for 17 years 'causeI thought that that would make me better.

28:41.805 --> 28:45.851
You know, that I could escape the wreckageof what happened to our family, but...

28:47.978 --> 28:50.355
No matter how many miles I put between us,

28:50.439 --> 28:55.152
I am still just that scared,stupid teenager.

28:57.905 --> 28:59.406
I'm no different.

29:03.952 --> 29:06.997
None of us ever left that hallwaywhere Dad died.

29:09.166 --> 29:10.167
Josie.

29:15.088 --> 29:17.341
I've said good-byeto enough people in my life.

29:17.424 --> 29:18.842
I can't do it anymore.

29:19.426 --> 29:20.969
Neither can you.

29:21.553 --> 29:22.804
Stay.

29:27.017 --> 29:28.519
Please.

29:36.902 --> 29:38.278
Yeah. What's up?

29:38.362 --> 29:41.532
That woman you asked me to look into,Shirley Maxwell--

29:41.615 --> 29:44.826
-Find anything?-Yeah. She was a seamstress by trade.

29:44.910 --> 29:47.663
Took in foster kids from the neighborhood,sort of, unofficially.

29:47.746 --> 29:48.789
Still have a local address?

29:48.872 --> 29:51.667
She died in 1986. Drowned in the bay.

29:52.292 --> 29:55.170
There's a list of children that werein her care at the time of her death.

29:55.254 --> 29:58.465
And one of them was...

29:58.549 --> 29:59.883
Poppy Scoville.

30:08.433 --> 30:10.435
Come in. Come in.

30:13.397 --> 30:15.691
I'd get up to greet you, but...

30:17.651 --> 30:19.653
like I said on the phone, I'm...

30:22.364 --> 30:23.907
I'm dying.

30:29.788 --> 30:31.415
Is that for me?

30:32.541 --> 30:35.043
Of course it is. I know what you like.

30:50.475 --> 30:53.353
I gotta say, I'm surprised you... called.

30:53.437 --> 31:00.068
Addicts make amendsand dying people clean their slates.

31:08.869 --> 31:11.246
Your stuff looks different in here.

31:11.330 --> 31:13.123
Divorce is great for downsizing.

31:15.501 --> 31:18.045
We used to bethe queens of the neighborhood.

31:19.880 --> 31:21.673
Look at us now.

31:21.757 --> 31:23.342
Yeah. They used to envy us.

31:25.719 --> 31:28.055
Too bad we didn't know how good we had it.

31:29.139 --> 31:32.518
I did... until you fucked my husband.

31:38.690 --> 31:39.775
Yeah.

31:44.071 --> 31:46.156
Cancer is truly a monster.

31:47.115 --> 31:51.203
Being sick forces youto confront everything about yourself.

31:51.286 --> 31:52.538
The good, the bad.

31:52.621 --> 31:56.667
Sleeping with Chuckwas definitely the bad.

31:59.545 --> 32:02.047
Doesn't sound like much of an apology.

32:06.301 --> 32:08.720
That's as close as you're gonna get.

32:12.516 --> 32:14.977
I don't know what the hell I'm doing here.

32:15.060 --> 32:20.232
So, good luckwith the rest of your... amends.

32:20.315 --> 32:23.777
You know, it was very purifying for meto face my demons.

32:23.861 --> 32:25.529
You might wanna do it too.

32:25.612 --> 32:28.448
Coming clean, baring your soul.

32:28.532 --> 32:30.242
Answering a few questions.

32:30.325 --> 32:31.535
What the hell? What the hell--

32:31.618 --> 32:34.705
I know that you lied about my son.

32:34.788 --> 32:37.249
You are the reason he is in prison.

32:37.332 --> 32:39.710
Just tell the goddamn truth!

32:42.629 --> 32:43.630
That's it.

32:50.762 --> 32:52.681
You knew Chuck was abusing Lanie.

32:52.764 --> 32:54.099
-What?-That's motive.

32:54.808 --> 32:56.643
-Who in the world told you that?-Lanie.

32:56.727 --> 32:59.104
She doesn't know what she's talking about.

32:59.188 --> 33:02.608
She's all turned aroundfrom your fucking harassment.

33:02.691 --> 33:03.984
Plus the Antabuse.

33:04.067 --> 33:06.069
You were sober the night of the murder.

33:06.153 --> 33:07.821
That's your alibi blown.

33:07.905 --> 33:10.199
Add in the fact that you were huntingfor the murder weapon,

33:10.282 --> 33:11.700
which you've wielded yourself.

33:11.783 --> 33:13.202
What murder weapon? You got nothing.

33:13.285 --> 33:14.786
Actually, I do.

33:14.870 --> 33:17.497
I know you were in rehaba month before the murder.

33:17.581 --> 33:19.875
See, I think it was toughfor you in there.

33:19.958 --> 33:22.085
Alone and sober with the knowledge

33:22.169 --> 33:24.213
of what your husbandwas doing to your daughter.

33:24.296 --> 33:27.007
Dying over the fact that it all happenedunder your roof

33:27.090 --> 33:28.675
while you were stuck in the bottle.

33:28.759 --> 33:29.676
Fuck you.

33:29.760 --> 33:33.805
I spoke to your sober coach.I know you tried to do the right thing.

33:34.223 --> 33:36.391
I did not kill my husband--

33:36.475 --> 33:38.268
I know you did it, Erin.

33:38.352 --> 33:42.189
I'm finally putting the pieces togetherand the picture looks bad for you.

33:42.272 --> 33:43.440
But I can help.

33:43.524 --> 33:48.111
All those articles I wrote 19 years agogot him tried as an adult.

33:48.529 --> 33:50.197
My words have power.

33:50.280 --> 33:54.034
Now, do you want that powerwielded against you or to help you?

33:54.117 --> 33:55.452
You're insane.

33:55.536 --> 33:58.163
I'm doing the next episodewith or without you.

33:58.247 --> 34:02.501
But I'm the difference between the worldseeing you as a cold-blooded murderer

34:02.584 --> 34:05.796
or a loving mother who would do anythingto protect her daughter.

34:10.759 --> 34:12.177
All right.

34:13.929 --> 34:15.514
All right.

34:16.139 --> 34:17.933
I'll give you your interview.

34:18.725 --> 34:20.643
But I need some time.

34:20.726 --> 34:22.728
I'll meet you at Susan's tomorrow morning.

34:31.655 --> 34:32.697
Shit.

34:49.922 --> 34:50.966
Get outta here, man.

35:02.978 --> 35:06.690
CO Hill had somevery interesting information for me.

35:07.274 --> 35:09.318
It seems he gave you a little present.

35:09.401 --> 35:11.778
Told you to wait for orders from Kuvney.

35:13.071 --> 35:16.033
Then Kuvney's the onefound gutted in the corner.

35:20.245 --> 35:22.831
Look, that doesn't prove anything.

35:22.915 --> 35:25.334
I'm not a court. I don't need proof.

35:27.628 --> 35:29.421
Hey. Hey, hey!

35:30.214 --> 35:32.799
Hill, what are you doing?Get your boys back in.

35:36.011 --> 35:38.180
Hey, horse-fucker.

35:38.263 --> 35:39.264
What?

35:44.269 --> 35:45.479
Come on.

35:45.562 --> 35:48.440
Let's go. Get him in here. Let's go.

36:08.085 --> 36:09.086
Hey, Daddy.

36:10.504 --> 36:11.713
Hey, sweetheart.

36:14.424 --> 36:15.968
Your mother's favorite.

36:16.760 --> 36:19.346
Tulips?I thought daisies were her favorite.

36:19.429 --> 36:21.598
I used to pick themon the way home from school.

36:22.057 --> 36:24.184
That's why she told youthey were her favorite.

36:25.435 --> 36:27.646
Did she ever like them at all?

36:28.397 --> 36:30.274
She liked that you picked them for her.

36:33.485 --> 36:35.195
I'm always surprisedhow much you remember.

36:35.279 --> 36:36.655
You were so little then.

36:37.531 --> 36:39.741
I guess you were storing it all up.

36:41.076 --> 36:43.370
She's been gonelonger than we were together.

36:44.580 --> 36:46.498
I never thought of it that way.

36:48.166 --> 36:50.836
Every time I think I'm forgetting her,

36:51.253 --> 36:54.298
I hear Desiree laugh, and there she is...

36:55.382 --> 36:58.468
or your smile, and I see her.

36:59.928 --> 37:02.848
You know, Cydie doesn't remember her,but she's there too.

37:06.977 --> 37:08.729
That why you asked me up here?

37:11.148 --> 37:12.816
I wanna say no.

37:15.819 --> 37:17.112
Talk to me.

37:25.329 --> 37:26.830
I have CTE.

37:27.331 --> 37:28.665
CTE?

37:30.834 --> 37:32.711
I didn't think the doctors knew.

37:32.794 --> 37:34.379
That's what I told you all.

37:36.465 --> 37:39.843
You knew? When did you find out?Are they sure, Daddy?

37:39.927 --> 37:42.429
Doctors can't know for sureuntil I'm dead.

37:45.140 --> 37:47.559
But with all the boxing,that's what they think.

37:47.643 --> 37:49.978
I haven't told your sisters yetor Lillian.

37:51.647 --> 37:53.982
If it's true what they sayis happening in my head,

37:54.066 --> 37:58.487
I don't know what's gonna happen to meor what I'll be like.

37:59.154 --> 38:00.531
You'll be our father.

38:06.328 --> 38:08.330
When I'm gone and buried up herewith your mother,

38:08.413 --> 38:10.415
-I want you to keep coming back.-Daddy--

38:10.499 --> 38:12.793
No, not for me or her, but for you.

38:14.545 --> 38:15.838
Come and enjoy this view.

38:15.921 --> 38:21.802
This... big, bad, beautiful citythat made you who you are.

38:31.353 --> 38:32.354
Hey.

38:33.689 --> 38:34.773
Come watch the game with me.

38:36.733 --> 38:37.776
Lanie.

38:48.412 --> 38:50.956
What, are you time traveling to the '90s?

38:58.172 --> 39:00.090
-Hello, Erin.<i>-Hi, Alex. Is Lanie there?</i>

39:00.174 --> 39:01.800
Yeah, she's right here.

39:05.679 --> 39:06.847
Yeah, Mom.

39:06.930 --> 39:09.683
Lanie, you told that reporterthat your father was abusing you?

39:09.766 --> 39:12.311
<i>She cornered me at Melanie's.</i>

39:13.812 --> 39:15.397
Wait, why are you at her house?

39:15.480 --> 39:16.773
She set me up.

39:19.693 --> 39:21.403
Okay, listen. Where is it?

39:21.904 --> 39:25.157
<i>It's not in the storage space.It's not in the old home.</i>

39:25.657 --> 39:27.159
I don't know what you're talking about.

39:30.078 --> 39:31.413
<i>You're not gonna tell me.</i>

39:31.496 --> 39:34.374
All right, listen, Lanie. I am done.

39:34.458 --> 39:36.376
I can't take it anymore.

39:36.460 --> 39:39.588
<i>I can't do this anymore.And I am gonna talk.</i>

39:39.671 --> 39:42.633
I'm gonna tell the truth.I'm gonna tell her everything that I know.

39:42.716 --> 39:45.469
<i>And I'm gonna maybe try to fix things,the right way.</i>

39:45.552 --> 39:49.056
Just stay at Aunt Susan's.I will be right there.

39:49.139 --> 39:50.599
We can talk about this.

39:51.183 --> 39:54.228
<i>Protecting a childis a parent's most basic role.</i>

39:54.853 --> 39:59.816
It's hard to thrive, hard to functionwhen we feel threatened.

40:00.609 --> 40:02.736
-When we don't feel safe.-Come on. I said smile.

40:02.819 --> 40:08.200
<i>And when you're a parent,when you're a caretaker of someone else,</i>

40:08.283 --> 40:11.787
safety is an all-consuming concern.

40:12.329 --> 40:16.458
You were entrustedwith the life of this child.

40:16.542 --> 40:18.335
<i>This loved one.</i>

40:18.418 --> 40:22.172
<i>So, you will do anything and everythingto protect them.</i>

40:22.256 --> 40:25.300
-But how far is too far?-Let me go!

40:25.384 --> 40:29.137
