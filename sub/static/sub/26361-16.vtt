WEBVTT

00:04.221 --> 00:06.223
- In the criminal justice
system,

00:06.267 --> 00:07.790
sexually based offenses

00:07.833 --> 00:09.574
are considered
especially heinous.

00:09.618 --> 00:11.663
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:11.707 --> 00:13.491
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:13.535 --> 00:15.145
are members of an elite squad

00:15.189 --> 00:17.060
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:17.104 --> 00:19.802
These are their stories.

00:20.411 --> 00:23.936
- Jason, what did you think
about Meredith's intro

00:23.980 --> 00:25.721
on Avis and Ernest?
Go.

00:25.764 --> 00:27.114
- It was a total spoiler.

00:27.157 --> 00:28.593
- Yeah, but that's
what's cool about it.

00:28.637 --> 00:30.639
- Even though we know
their hopes and dreams

00:30.682 --> 00:32.162
are gonna come
to a crashing end?

00:32.206 --> 00:33.511
- It's so unfair.

00:33.555 --> 00:35.600
- But there's a silver lining.

00:35.644 --> 00:38.951
There is a happy ending
for humanity.

00:38.995 --> 00:40.605
- Yeah, I guess so.

00:40.649 --> 00:44.000
- Okay, Katie just gave me
the bat signal.

00:45.436 --> 00:46.872
All right, guys,
so go out there,

00:46.916 --> 00:48.657
cast your spells on the world.

00:48.700 --> 00:50.746
All right, badasses,
get out of here.

00:50.789 --> 00:52.139
Go!

01:05.761 --> 01:07.545
- Hey, Micah.

01:07.589 --> 01:09.112
Potato!

01:09.156 --> 01:11.549
- There he is, it'll just be
two or three days max.

01:11.593 --> 01:14.987
There's that, and more food
under the sink if you need it.

01:15.031 --> 01:17.555
- Cool. We're gonna have hella
fun, aren't we, Po?

01:17.599 --> 01:20.036
- And Potato likes it
when you scratch him

01:20.080 --> 01:21.951
behind the ears,
don't you, baby?

01:21.994 --> 01:23.779
Yeah.

01:24.693 --> 01:27.609
Bye, buddy.

01:27.652 --> 01:29.176
Okay.

01:39.621 --> 01:42.493
- Come on, Potato,
we have to go out. Come!

01:42.537 --> 01:44.278
Come.

01:44.321 --> 01:47.194
- Po, Micah will be back soon.

01:48.847 --> 01:51.154
- Aw, Po...

01:57.987 --> 01:59.467
- Micah?

02:13.829 --> 02:15.961
Oh, my God.

02:21.619 --> 02:23.143
- I thought Rollins
was on call tonight.

02:23.186 --> 02:24.622
- Jesse has the flu.

02:24.666 --> 02:25.667
- Baby germs, great.

02:25.710 --> 02:26.929
Now we're
all gonna get sick.

02:26.972 --> 02:28.191
- Flu shot,
Carisi.

02:28.235 --> 02:29.714
- What do you got?

02:29.758 --> 02:32.674
- Micah Fuller.
Neighbor found him, called 911.

02:32.717 --> 02:34.197
- Okay, any signs
of forced entry?

02:34.241 --> 02:35.242
- Nope, his door was unlocked.

02:35.285 --> 02:36.808
- What about a struggle?

02:36.852 --> 02:38.941
- No, just a couple of empty
sleeping pill bottles

02:38.984 --> 02:40.464
on the coffee table.

02:40.508 --> 02:42.031
He left his dog with
the neighbor who found him.

02:42.074 --> 02:46.992
- Okay, if this is a suicide,
why did you call us?

02:47.036 --> 02:49.517
- Some pictures on the floor.

02:57.264 --> 02:59.657
- "I'm sorry."

02:59.701 --> 03:03.139
These kids
can't be more than 11 or 12.

03:03.183 --> 03:05.663
Micah Fuller was a--
was a pedophile?

03:05.707 --> 03:07.926
- Looks like it
finally caught up with him.

03:07.970 --> 03:12.453
- Well, he may be dead
but his victims aren't.

04:04.505 --> 04:06.985
- Have we figured out
who these kids are?

04:07.029 --> 04:08.552
- TARU is doing a sweep
of Micah Fuller's devices,

04:08.596 --> 04:10.075
but so far, nothing.
He took Polaroids, so.

04:10.119 --> 04:11.686
- It's a good way to avoid
a digital footprint.

04:11.729 --> 04:13.340
You uploaded these to NCMEC?

04:13.383 --> 04:15.255
- Yeah, I sent the originals
to the lab for analysis.

04:15.298 --> 04:16.299
- Okay, so what do we know
about this guy?

04:16.343 --> 04:17.344
- Well, I mean, the neighbors

04:17.387 --> 04:18.475
say he was quiet, polite.

04:18.519 --> 04:19.781
There was a girlfriend briefly.

04:19.824 --> 04:21.261
His parents are
at the morgue now.

04:21.304 --> 04:22.566
They should be
down here shortly.

04:22.610 --> 04:24.264
- We know what he did
for a living?

04:24.307 --> 04:26.048
- Yeah, he worked at Alastair
Bookstore, it's downtown.

04:26.091 --> 04:28.093
- I don't know it.
Okay, you stay with the photos,

04:28.137 --> 04:29.399
I'll have
Carisi hit the bookstore.

04:29.443 --> 04:30.966
- All right.

04:35.449 --> 04:37.059
- When did this happen?
- Over the weekend.

04:37.102 --> 04:38.626
- Oh, no.

04:38.669 --> 04:41.281
- Did Micah have any contact
with the kids who come in here?

04:41.324 --> 04:42.934
- Most of his time was spent
with books

04:42.978 --> 04:46.024
but he did run our
YA reading group on Saturdays.

04:46.068 --> 04:48.766
- Did the parents have any
involvement in this group?

04:48.810 --> 04:50.725
- Micah didn't want them here.

04:50.768 --> 04:53.423
He seemed more comfortable
with teenagers.

04:53.467 --> 04:56.818
- This reading group,
how old were the kids?

04:56.861 --> 04:58.385
- 11 to 15?

04:58.428 --> 05:00.256
- Okay, were any of the boys
Caucasian?

05:00.300 --> 05:02.345
- Two.

05:02.389 --> 05:04.086
- I'm gonna need their names.

05:06.741 --> 05:09.091
- You're telling us this sicko
from the reading group

05:09.134 --> 05:10.353
took pictures of our son?

05:10.397 --> 05:13.051
- We're not even sure
it is him.

05:20.189 --> 05:22.409
- They're not.

05:22.452 --> 05:25.455
- You're sure?
- No, Jason is chubbier

05:25.499 --> 05:26.935
than these boys and he has

05:26.978 --> 05:28.937
three big freckles
on his right shoulder.

05:28.980 --> 05:31.853
- There's no way any of those
pictures are my son.

05:31.896 --> 05:33.420
Tommy wears boxers
like his dad.

05:33.463 --> 05:34.464
- Thank you for coming in.

05:34.508 --> 05:35.770
- But just because he's not

05:35.813 --> 05:37.641
in any of those pictures
doesn't mean--

05:37.685 --> 05:40.165
He talked about
this Micah kid all the time.

05:40.209 --> 05:41.689
He still could've--
- Listen.

05:41.732 --> 05:44.169
There's no way of knowing,
Mr. Meyers.

05:44.213 --> 05:47.172
So I think the best thing for
you to do is go home,

05:47.216 --> 05:49.871
have a conversation with your
son and get back to us, okay?

05:49.914 --> 05:51.786
- We're the Fullers.
Micah's parents.

05:51.829 --> 05:55.355
- Hey, you better hope that
your son didn't touch my kid.

05:55.398 --> 05:58.270
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Easy, easy.

05:58.314 --> 06:00.272
- Guys, come--come this way.

06:00.316 --> 06:02.927
- What is that man
talking about?

06:02.971 --> 06:04.712
- Come on.

06:04.755 --> 06:07.584
- Micah struggled
with depression.

06:07.628 --> 06:09.847
We really thought he turned
a corner when he met Helen.

06:09.891 --> 06:12.981
- Helen?
Helen is his girlfriend?

06:13.024 --> 06:15.897
- They broke up
about a week ago.

06:15.940 --> 06:18.116
He texted me,
he said he was fine,

06:18.160 --> 06:20.902
but I could tell he was upset.

06:20.945 --> 06:25.428
- So Mr. and Mrs. Fuller,
Micah had some Polaroids.

06:25.472 --> 06:29.650
That were of young,

06:29.693 --> 06:32.827
unclothed boys.

06:34.698 --> 06:36.091
- What do you mean?

06:37.484 --> 06:39.703
Nate.
- I wanna see them.

06:39.747 --> 06:42.750
- I don't see how that would
help anybody, Mr. Fuller,

06:42.793 --> 06:45.709
and those--
those boys are victims.

06:45.753 --> 06:48.103
- Yeah, and so is my son.

07:10.125 --> 07:12.736
- Oh, my God.

07:12.780 --> 07:13.694
- What?

07:13.737 --> 07:16.305
This is Micah.
When he was a kid.

07:16.348 --> 07:18.263
- Which one?

07:18.307 --> 07:20.091
All of them.

07:20.135 --> 07:22.267
Th--this is his bedroom.

07:22.311 --> 07:24.574
This is our bathroom.

07:24.618 --> 07:26.184
We bought him
those outer space jockeys

07:26.228 --> 07:29.274
when he was 11 years old.
- So who the hell took these?

07:29.318 --> 07:31.494
- Does this mean
Micah was molested?

07:31.538 --> 07:32.669
- You're damn right it does.

07:32.713 --> 07:34.062
How else do you explain these?

07:34.105 --> 07:35.716
- Let's--let's not
jump to conclusions.

07:35.759 --> 07:38.196
We don't know.
Um,

07:38.240 --> 07:40.155
I think the best place
to start right now

07:40.198 --> 07:43.550
is if you could give
us Helen's last name.

07:46.335 --> 07:48.511
- He killed himself
because of me?

07:48.555 --> 07:50.513
- No, of course not.

07:50.557 --> 07:52.733
Micah had issues.

07:52.776 --> 07:55.387
- Believe me, I know.

07:55.431 --> 07:57.477
- What do you mean?

07:57.520 --> 07:59.957
- Um, Micah took things slow.

08:00.001 --> 08:03.352
He didn't even kiss me
until our fourth date.

08:03.395 --> 08:06.573
We never actually had sex.

08:06.616 --> 08:08.096
- Did you ask him about that?

08:08.139 --> 08:11.012
- He said he really liked me
and wanted to wait.

08:11.926 --> 08:13.318
I thought it was sweet at first

08:13.362 --> 08:15.190
but then I started to feel
like it was me.

08:15.233 --> 08:17.148
- It wasn't.

08:17.192 --> 08:20.369
- The night we finally decided
to sleep together.

08:20.412 --> 08:23.067
Um, Micah couldn't.

08:23.111 --> 08:27.768
That's when he told me somebody
molested him when he was a kid.

08:27.811 --> 08:29.509
- Did he say by who?

08:29.552 --> 08:31.989
- No.

08:32.033 --> 08:34.644
He did say that the guy
asked him

08:34.688 --> 08:36.167
to take pictures of himself.

08:36.211 --> 08:39.344
I felt like a jerk
for breaking up with him, but

08:39.388 --> 08:43.261
I'm 20 years old I just--
I wanted a normal relationship.

08:45.176 --> 08:48.005
- Do you know of anyone
who would know?

08:48.049 --> 08:50.355
- He did mention this guy,
Billy,

08:50.399 --> 08:52.270
who used to be his best friend.

08:52.314 --> 08:54.229
Billy Ryan.

09:00.409 --> 09:03.368
- How did he...

09:03.412 --> 09:04.979
Sorry, dude.
Don't tell me.

09:05.022 --> 09:08.112
- Micah's girlfriend told us
that you two

09:08.156 --> 09:09.723
were pretty close
in middle school.

09:09.766 --> 09:12.029
- Yeah, grew up down the street
from each other.

09:12.073 --> 09:14.466
- When's the last time
you saw Micah?

09:14.510 --> 09:16.991
- Not for a while.

09:17.034 --> 09:18.035
Damn.

09:18.079 --> 09:19.559
- What is it?

09:19.602 --> 09:22.431
- Micah emailed me,
like, two days ago.

09:22.474 --> 09:23.911
- What'd he say?

09:23.954 --> 09:26.653
- I hadn't opened it yet.
Me and my girl were smurfing

09:26.696 --> 09:28.872
on level six of
"Kill or be Slaughtered."

09:28.916 --> 09:30.047
Hang on.

09:30.091 --> 09:32.267
Okay,
this is from Saturday night.

09:32.310 --> 09:35.009
Hey,
sorry I've been out of touch.

09:35.052 --> 09:37.054
You might be hearing some
things about me

09:37.098 --> 09:40.275
in the near future that will be
hard for you to understand.

09:40.318 --> 09:42.494
All I can bring myself to say
right now is,

09:42.538 --> 09:46.673
if you wanna know why,
ask Gary.

09:46.716 --> 09:48.718
- Who's Gary?

09:48.762 --> 09:49.937
- I don't know.

09:49.980 --> 09:51.503
- Why would he send you that,
then?

09:51.547 --> 09:54.332
- If I would've read this,
maybe I could have...

09:54.376 --> 09:55.899
Ugh.

09:55.943 --> 09:58.989
- Okay, look, man.
Let's go back to the beginning.

09:59.033 --> 10:01.601
What were you and Micah
into when you were,

10:01.644 --> 10:03.907
like, 12, 11 years old?

10:03.951 --> 10:06.518
- We played video games
at our apartments.

10:06.562 --> 10:08.825
Went to the movies, the park.

10:08.869 --> 10:10.784
- Was Micah into anything else?

10:12.133 --> 10:15.963
- Wait a second.
Micah used to do magic tricks.

10:16.006 --> 10:18.226
He made these nerdy
YouTube videos

10:18.269 --> 10:19.662
with a costume and props.

10:19.706 --> 10:22.752
Gary was the guy
who taught him magic.

10:23.884 --> 10:27.061
One day Micah threw away
all of his magic stuff.

10:28.105 --> 10:30.281
Yeah, I remember
that being super weird.

10:30.325 --> 10:33.154
You know, to be so
into something and then,

10:33.197 --> 10:35.765
you know, game over.

10:41.423 --> 10:44.382
- So TARU was able to recover
Micah's YouTube videos.

10:44.426 --> 10:46.776
- And what happens on the
internet stays on the internet.

10:46.820 --> 10:47.951
- I just talked to the Fullers,

10:47.995 --> 10:51.346
they have no idea
who this Gary is.

10:51.389 --> 10:52.782
- Hello, and welcome

10:52.826 --> 10:54.305
to the
Marvelous Micah Magic Show,

10:54.349 --> 10:57.787
starring yours truly,
ta-da!

10:57.831 --> 11:00.660
- He made nine videos.
This was the last one.

11:00.703 --> 11:02.139
June 20th 2009.

11:02.183 --> 11:03.532
- Okay,
he would have been the same age

11:03.575 --> 11:04.838
as he was in the Polaroids.

11:09.625 --> 11:11.801
Ahh, that really hurt.

11:11.845 --> 11:14.064
Abracadabra!

11:15.500 --> 11:16.719
- Hold on, there.
Go back.

11:16.763 --> 11:19.243
Go back a few frames.

11:19.287 --> 11:21.419
There.

11:21.463 --> 11:24.379
Look at that.
The poster on the wall.

11:24.422 --> 11:26.468
The Gray Rabbit Magic Shop.

11:26.511 --> 11:28.426
You guys, go.

11:30.820 --> 11:34.345
- I--I think your boy is gonna
love these vanishing coins.

11:34.389 --> 11:37.131
And if you bring him by,
I'll show him how

11:37.174 --> 11:39.220
to turn a dollar
bill into a C note.

11:40.177 --> 11:42.484
- Gary?
- That's me.

11:42.527 --> 11:44.181
- Are you the owner?

11:44.225 --> 11:47.315
- I oughta be, I've been
working here 15 years.

11:47.358 --> 11:50.535
Is this about the shoplifting
thing last month?

11:50.579 --> 11:55.236
- Not exactly.
I wanna ask you about this boy.

11:55.279 --> 11:57.499
- Micah Fuller.

11:57.542 --> 11:59.806
You recognize him?

11:59.849 --> 12:02.852
- No, I can't say I do.

12:02.896 --> 12:04.288
Excuse me.

12:12.166 --> 12:14.734
- Customer appreciation
snapshots?

12:14.777 --> 12:16.213
- Yeah.
- Mind if I take a look

12:16.257 --> 12:17.954
at your camera?

12:17.998 --> 12:19.739
- Oh, gosh.
That thing broke

12:19.782 --> 12:21.828
a long time ago.

12:23.003 --> 12:25.788
So what'd you say,
his name is Michael?

12:25.832 --> 12:26.789
- Micah.

12:26.833 --> 12:28.573
- Micah.

12:28.617 --> 12:32.969
No, I'm sorry.
I wish I could be more help.

12:33.840 --> 12:36.190
- Well, us too, Gary.
Us too.

12:36.233 --> 12:37.757
- Thanks.

12:45.982 --> 12:47.723
- So Gary Dolan, age 63.

12:47.767 --> 12:49.246
Fin said he looked like
he'd seen a ghost

12:49.290 --> 12:51.161
when they showed
him a photo of Micah.

12:51.205 --> 12:52.467
- If there's any magic
in the world,

12:52.510 --> 12:53.468
let's hope Micah's
haunting him.

12:53.511 --> 12:54.904
- Polaroids at the shop

12:54.948 --> 12:56.514
were just like the ones
at the crime scene.

12:56.558 --> 12:57.733
- Yeah, he's got the perfect
set up there

12:57.777 --> 12:58.952
to groom his victims.

12:58.995 --> 13:00.692
- Be great if there was
any proof of that.

13:00.736 --> 13:02.346
- Yep, well, we'll try to
track down the kids

13:02.390 --> 13:03.783
from the Magic Shop photos.

13:03.826 --> 13:05.219
- It would be great
if you could get us

13:05.262 --> 13:06.960
a warrant for
Dolan's apartment.

13:07.003 --> 13:09.179
- I need to allege a specific
crime to apply for a warrant.

13:09.223 --> 13:11.355
- Micah's Polaroids.
- Were in Micah's possession,

13:11.399 --> 13:12.922
not Dolan's.
Look,

13:12.966 --> 13:14.358
I'd love to go after this guy

13:14.402 --> 13:16.926
but I need something
to hang my hat on.

13:22.062 --> 13:26.718
- I keep replaying the last
time Micah and I spoke.

13:26.762 --> 13:28.198
Why didn't I see it?

13:28.242 --> 13:31.636
- I was so hard on him,
I'll never forgive myself.

13:31.680 --> 13:35.423
- Can't imagine how difficult

13:35.466 --> 13:37.077
this is for both of you.

13:37.120 --> 13:39.383
You know,
there are support groups

13:39.427 --> 13:42.256
that--that can help.

13:43.213 --> 13:45.476
- Thank you.

13:45.520 --> 13:48.392
You said you had
some more questions for us?

13:48.436 --> 13:50.568
- I do.

13:50.612 --> 13:53.571
Did Micah ever display
any behavior

13:53.615 --> 13:56.487
back then that seemed

13:56.531 --> 13:58.838
highly sexualized?

14:00.796 --> 14:02.667
You know, we're--
we're just

14:02.711 --> 14:05.801
trying to pinpoint a time when
something may have happened.

14:05.845 --> 14:08.151
- I wouldn't have overlooked
something like that.

14:08.195 --> 14:09.500
- There was one time.

14:09.544 --> 14:11.894
You were in Boulder
at your college reunion.

14:11.938 --> 14:13.200
I had to take him
to the doctor.

14:13.243 --> 14:15.289
- Why?

14:15.332 --> 14:18.422
He spilled drain cleaner
on his--on his genitals.

14:18.466 --> 14:19.859
- What?
- I knew if I told you

14:19.902 --> 14:21.382
you'd be on
the first plane home.

14:21.425 --> 14:24.472
- Okay, I'm gonna need
the exact date

14:24.515 --> 14:28.215
of your college reunion.

14:28.258 --> 14:29.738
- You're wasting your time.

14:29.781 --> 14:32.828
- No worries, I'm enjoying
trashing your place.

14:36.658 --> 14:38.529
There's nothing
in the bedroom.

14:38.573 --> 14:40.357
- Nothing in there, either.

14:40.401 --> 14:41.663
Look at this,
on top of everything else,

14:41.706 --> 14:43.317
he was a coach
for a youth league?

14:43.360 --> 14:45.797
What, in the 80's?

14:45.841 --> 14:48.365
And how many of those kids...

14:54.763 --> 14:55.590
What, Liv?

14:55.633 --> 14:59.159
- It's nothing,
it just--um,

14:59.202 --> 15:02.902
One of these kids looks like
somebody I used to know.

15:15.479 --> 15:17.481
- Hey, Liv.

15:17.525 --> 15:18.830
Well, I'm flattered
that you recognized me.

15:18.874 --> 15:20.484
Where'd you--
where'd you get this?

15:20.528 --> 15:22.356
- It came up on a case
that we're working on.

15:22.399 --> 15:25.533
- Oh really? What, a deep dive
into the Hudson youth league?

15:25.576 --> 15:27.448
- Pedophile named Gary Dolan.

15:27.491 --> 15:29.319
- Ah, coach Gary.

15:29.363 --> 15:30.755
Really?

15:30.799 --> 15:33.019
- We found this picture
in his apartment.

15:33.062 --> 15:35.891
- Oh, yeah, well.
There's a coincidence for ya.

15:35.935 --> 15:38.720
- We believe that he
molested a kid in 2009.

15:38.763 --> 15:39.851
- Hey,
you want a cup of coffee, Liv?

15:39.895 --> 15:42.506
- No, no, I'm good.
Um,

15:42.550 --> 15:44.291
So Dolan worked
in a magic shop,

15:44.334 --> 15:46.641
that's where he met the victim.

15:46.684 --> 15:49.296
Three days ago the kid
committed suicide.

15:49.339 --> 15:50.906
Jesus.

15:50.950 --> 15:53.735
- Look, I know that it's
a long shot, but

15:53.778 --> 15:57.434
if you remember any instance
where he was inappropriate

15:57.478 --> 15:58.783
with any of the kids?

15:58.827 --> 16:00.916
- No, no, I mean,
it was a long time ago.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.005
I played for him for,
I don't know, one season?

16:03.049 --> 16:04.180
It was nothing.

16:04.224 --> 16:06.052
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:06.095 --> 16:07.967
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:08.010 --> 16:10.578
- Uh, I forgot
the laundry room keycard.

16:10.621 --> 16:13.494
- You know, um, this is, uh,
this is my friend--

16:13.537 --> 16:15.235
this is Olivia,
and this is Madison,

16:15.278 --> 16:17.889
She's my neighbor.

16:17.933 --> 16:20.196
- I'm gonna go.

16:20.240 --> 16:22.068
- Hey, Liv, I'm real sorry
I couldn't help you out.

16:22.111 --> 16:24.157
- Yeah, no worries.
Nice meeting you.

16:24.200 --> 16:26.507
- Yeah.
- Bye.

16:29.727 --> 16:32.034
- Now I can allege a specific
act of sexual abuse.

16:32.078 --> 16:33.514
The day Micah saw the doctor.
It's something.

16:33.557 --> 16:35.037
- So what else do you need?

16:35.081 --> 16:37.039
- Preferably a victim who's
still alive

16:37.083 --> 16:38.780
and willing to press charges.
- Well, we're working on that.

16:38.823 --> 16:42.131
Look, Dolan has probably been
abusing boys since the 80's.

16:42.175 --> 16:43.567
- What makes you say that?

16:43.611 --> 16:45.700
- Because he coached
youth baseball back then.

16:45.743 --> 16:47.093
- Wow. Fertile grounds
for a predator.

16:47.136 --> 16:50.618
- You know, one weird thing,

16:51.532 --> 16:55.710
Brian Cassidy was on
one of Dolan's teams.

16:56.972 --> 16:58.626
- Did you ask Cassidy
about Dolan?

16:58.669 --> 17:02.847
- I did, and he doesn't
remember anything.

17:03.979 --> 17:05.763
I'm gonna check in with
the Youth League office

17:05.807 --> 17:07.591
and I'll let you
know if we find out anything.

17:07.635 --> 17:09.898
- Yeah, okay.

17:16.818 --> 17:18.385
Come on.

17:18.428 --> 17:19.777
Cassidy, it's Peter Stone.

17:19.821 --> 17:21.997
Call me back, it's important.

17:50.025 --> 17:51.722
- Damnit.

17:57.424 --> 17:58.642
- Cassidy!
Hey.

17:58.686 --> 18:00.688
- Stone,
what are you doing here, man?

18:00.731 --> 18:03.125
- That's a colt.
Your service weapon's a Glock.

18:03.169 --> 18:04.953
- You don't wanna
mess with me right now.

18:04.996 --> 18:06.781
- Really, well, I hope you're
ready to shoot me too

18:06.824 --> 18:07.999
'cause
that's what it's gonna take.

18:08.043 --> 18:09.697
- Really?
Whose side are you on, huh?

18:09.740 --> 18:11.133
- Whose side am I on?
- Yeah, whose side?

18:11.177 --> 18:13.657
After what he did to that kid?
What he did to me?

18:13.701 --> 18:15.703
- I'm not gonna let you
ruin your life!

18:15.746 --> 18:17.139
- Yeah, you're too late
for that!

18:17.183 --> 18:18.271
Get your hands off me!

18:18.314 --> 18:20.969
- Stop, stop!
- Get your hands off me!

18:21.012 --> 18:22.884
- Stop!

18:22.927 --> 18:24.712
Stop.

18:26.017 --> 18:27.541
Okay?

18:30.196 --> 18:33.677
Hey, think about
what you're doing.

18:33.721 --> 18:36.202
It's not gonna happen
like this, Brian, okay?

18:49.345 --> 18:50.433
- Here.

18:56.004 --> 18:58.615
- Look,
the last time I checked,

18:58.659 --> 19:00.791
Dolan moved down
to Jacksonville in the 90's.

19:00.835 --> 19:02.489
All right, I had no idea he was
back up here hurting kids.

19:02.532 --> 19:04.143
I swear to God.

19:04.186 --> 19:05.622
I'm the one
who's supposed to stop him.

19:05.666 --> 19:07.842
- And then Liv comes to your
door with this?

19:07.885 --> 19:09.191
That must have been tough.

19:09.235 --> 19:12.238
- Yeah, tough?
No, you have no idea.

19:12.281 --> 19:14.414
- Look, with your testimony,
we're gonna put

19:14.457 --> 19:15.806
this son of a bitch
away for a long time.

19:15.850 --> 19:17.808
- Testimony?
What are you crazy?

19:17.852 --> 19:20.333
I'm not testifying in an open
court and telling

19:20.376 --> 19:22.248
a bunch of strangers what that

19:22.291 --> 19:24.032
sick son of a bitch did to me.

19:24.075 --> 19:26.165
- Hey, this isn't your fault.

19:26.208 --> 19:27.775
- Save your breath.

19:27.818 --> 19:30.081
- You have done the hard part.
The rest is downhill from here.

19:30.125 --> 19:32.954
- The hard part?

19:32.997 --> 19:35.130
Are you crazy?

19:35.174 --> 19:37.263
I'm damaged goods, Stone.

19:37.306 --> 19:40.788
I see it every time
I look in the mirror.

19:44.879 --> 19:47.882
- Maybe you should talk to Liv.

19:47.925 --> 19:50.667
- No.

19:50.711 --> 19:52.278
No man, she--

19:52.321 --> 19:53.801
She can't know
anything about this.

19:53.844 --> 19:55.368
You gotta--
you gotta promise me that.

19:55.411 --> 19:57.021
No, no, no.
She's the only person

19:57.065 --> 19:59.241
who's ever seen any good in me.

19:59.285 --> 20:02.505
And I can't not have that.

20:02.549 --> 20:04.333
I need that.

20:04.377 --> 20:05.291
- Okay.

20:05.334 --> 20:09.120
- You have to find another way.

20:18.565 --> 20:20.828
- I'll be presenting
to a grand jury tomorrow.

20:20.871 --> 20:22.090
Once your client is indicted,

20:22.133 --> 20:23.700
the plea will be top count
only.

20:23.744 --> 20:27.313
- So what is the one time,
super-duper, special offer?

20:27.356 --> 20:29.706
Sexual abuse in the first
degree, three to nine.

20:29.750 --> 20:31.055
- Years?

20:31.099 --> 20:32.709
- Micah committed suicide
because of you.

20:32.753 --> 20:35.059
- You're damn lucky I can't
prosecute you for homicide.

20:35.103 --> 20:39.063
- I had absolutely nothing to
do with this young man's death.

20:39.107 --> 20:41.370
I am a convenient scapegoat.

20:41.414 --> 20:43.242
- You have a thin connection
at best between my client

20:43.285 --> 20:44.895
and Micah Fuller.

20:44.939 --> 20:46.549
- How do you explain the email
that named your client?

20:46.593 --> 20:48.377
- Come on, there must be
a million guys

20:48.421 --> 20:50.161
in this country named Gary.

20:50.205 --> 20:53.164
- Micah Fuller wrote that when
he was high as a space shuttle.

20:53.208 --> 20:55.384
- Micah was a troubled boy.

20:55.428 --> 20:57.386
You know, I tried to foster

20:57.430 --> 21:00.041
his love of magic
ten years ago.

21:00.084 --> 21:02.043
You know, give a troubled boy
a little attention--

21:02.086 --> 21:04.611
- I am gonna bury you, Dolan.

21:06.090 --> 21:09.268
You're a serial predator
and you've been preying on boys

21:09.311 --> 21:11.618
since you coached
youth league baseball.

21:14.621 --> 21:16.405
- Your victim is dead
and your entire case

21:16.449 --> 21:17.624
is smoke and mirrors.

21:17.667 --> 21:20.235
Let's go, Gary.
Waste of time.

21:28.199 --> 21:29.288
- Youth League?

21:29.331 --> 21:30.550
- I was bluffing.

21:30.593 --> 21:32.291
- Oh, 'cause Liv told me that,
um,

21:32.334 --> 21:34.902
Cassidy was in one of
Dolan's team photos.

21:36.338 --> 21:38.035
- She told me
that was a coincidence.

21:38.079 --> 21:40.299
- 'Cause you remember how
Cassidy lost it on the stand

21:40.342 --> 21:42.779
last year testifying against
that pedophile doctor?

21:42.823 --> 21:44.694
- Yeah.

21:44.738 --> 21:46.261
What are you saying?

21:46.305 --> 21:48.568
- I'm not sure.

21:52.006 --> 21:53.964
- Get a green juice?

21:54.008 --> 21:57.011
- A green juice?
What a shock.

21:57.054 --> 21:58.839
And a coffee.

21:58.882 --> 22:01.015
- Black.

22:01.058 --> 22:03.017
- That's great, thanks.

22:03.060 --> 22:04.758
So what's up?

22:04.801 --> 22:06.847
- I've been going through
the social media pages.

22:06.890 --> 22:09.502
Some of these kids I played
Youth League with.

22:09.545 --> 22:12.156
There's a few boys there this
guy Dolan

22:12.200 --> 22:14.333
may have targeted.

22:14.376 --> 22:16.378
Can I ask you a question,
Stone?

22:16.422 --> 22:18.511
If something happened
back then,

22:18.554 --> 22:21.165
it's too late to prosecute now,
right?

22:21.209 --> 22:22.515
- I could still use them

22:22.558 --> 22:25.082
as prior bad acts witnesses
in Micah's case.

22:25.126 --> 22:26.606
Can we reach out to them?

22:26.649 --> 22:30.087
- It's not something you wanna
approach over a telephone.

22:30.131 --> 22:32.176
One of the guys
lives in Connecticut,

22:32.220 --> 22:34.657
one guy lives
in Providence.

22:34.701 --> 22:37.486
You feel like
taking a road trip with me?

22:43.362 --> 22:46.234
- Did this coach
do that to you, Rob?

22:46.277 --> 22:50.281
- So, you just assumed
the gay guy

22:50.325 --> 22:52.022
must have been diddled?
Is that it?

22:52.066 --> 22:55.025
- Look, we're just, uh, we're
just asking questions here.

22:55.069 --> 22:57.680
I mean, I know
this is uncomfortable.

22:57.724 --> 23:00.335
- Why is this even
coming up now?

23:00.379 --> 23:03.382
- This is Gary Dolan's
latest victim.

23:05.166 --> 23:06.515
- Oh, my God.

23:06.559 --> 23:09.518
- Look, Micah Fuller
was 22 years old.

23:09.562 --> 23:11.041
All right?

23:11.085 --> 23:12.695
He committed suicide

23:12.739 --> 23:15.176
because Gary molested him
ten years ago.

23:15.219 --> 23:18.092
- Well, there is nothing that I
can do about that,

23:18.135 --> 23:20.616
now is there?

23:25.360 --> 23:27.014
- Hey, Rob.

23:27.057 --> 23:29.669
Gary paid a lot of attention
to you back then, right?

23:29.712 --> 23:31.714
He gave you rides to the games?

23:31.758 --> 23:33.542
That Wilson A 2000
that he bought you.

23:33.586 --> 23:36.023
I mean, hell,
I would'a done anything

23:36.066 --> 23:38.242
to score a pro mitt
like that.

23:38.286 --> 23:40.854
- How envious were you, Brian?

23:40.897 --> 23:42.421
Hmm?

23:43.509 --> 23:45.728
Did you get into
Gary's station wagon?

23:50.951 --> 23:52.866
- If you testify, Mr. Dennison,
we can--

23:52.909 --> 23:55.346
- Not a chance.

23:56.739 --> 23:58.741
I want you to take
your snapshots

23:58.785 --> 24:01.962
and I want you
to get the hell out.

24:02.005 --> 24:04.443
- Come on, Rob, these problems
we've had, they could--

24:04.486 --> 24:07.620
- Shut up, Ted.

24:09.622 --> 24:11.667
I don't have to listen to this.

24:21.372 --> 24:23.810
- Yo!
Amigo Leo.

24:23.853 --> 24:26.465
- Brian Cassidy.
-  Come here.

24:26.508 --> 24:29.642
What it do, my man?
What's going on, huh?

24:29.685 --> 24:31.600
- How long has it been?
- Been a long time.

24:31.644 --> 24:33.167
- My mom told me
you became a detective.

24:33.210 --> 24:35.038
Just like your old man.
- Can you believe that?

24:35.082 --> 24:36.910
- Well, good for you.
- Thanks, thanks.

24:36.953 --> 24:39.303
Hey, you got somewhere private
that we could talk, maybe?

24:39.347 --> 24:41.741
For a hot second?
- Yeah.

24:41.784 --> 24:43.394
- Yeah? Awesome.
- Sure, man.

24:43.438 --> 24:44.918
- Okay.
- Yeah, right in there.

24:44.961 --> 24:49.879
Coach Gary? Yeah, that guy
was definitely out there.

24:49.923 --> 24:51.707
You know?

24:53.100 --> 24:55.145
But I never had anything
weird with him.

24:55.189 --> 24:56.451
- Yeah, okay.

24:56.495 --> 24:57.800
One day
you're mowing down batters

24:57.844 --> 24:59.628
like it's no one's
business, right?

24:59.672 --> 25:01.500
And all of a sudden you just up
and poof.

25:01.543 --> 25:03.502
You disappear.
What was that?

25:05.025 --> 25:06.069
- I got bored.

25:06.113 --> 25:07.288
- Got bored?
No, no, come on.

25:07.331 --> 25:09.377
I don't buy that.
Not for a second.

25:11.640 --> 25:15.862
- Look, I'm really sorry
about this Micah kid.

25:15.905 --> 25:18.647
But I should really
get back to work.

25:18.691 --> 25:19.866
Good seeing you, Brian.

25:19.909 --> 25:21.128
- Yeah, you too.

25:21.171 --> 25:22.346
Hey, is that your boy
over there on the wall?

25:22.390 --> 25:25.741
- Yeah.
Connor.

25:25.785 --> 25:27.569
His mom and I are divorced.

25:27.613 --> 25:29.179
I don't get to see him
that much.

25:29.223 --> 25:30.920
- He's a good looking kid.

25:32.748 --> 25:36.099
You know,
I read your rap sheet.

25:36.143 --> 25:38.798
On the drive up here.

25:38.841 --> 25:40.321
- Did you?
- Yeah.

25:40.364 --> 25:43.454
And I'll bet you 100 bucks

25:43.498 --> 25:46.719
there's booze
in that thermos over there.

25:48.895 --> 25:51.811
- I always liked you, Cassidy.

25:51.854 --> 25:54.857
But I am not above
knocking your lights out.

25:54.901 --> 25:56.467
- Nobody's judging you,
Mr. Berry.

25:56.511 --> 25:58.948
- Ah, nah, it's okay.
I got this.

25:58.992 --> 26:01.168
Yeah, I recognize that anger.
I see it.

26:01.211 --> 26:04.345
I been there.
I get it.

26:04.388 --> 26:06.608
What'd Gary do to you?

26:08.697 --> 26:10.220
All right,
I'll tell you what, Leo.

26:10.264 --> 26:12.875
We're staying at the Sheraton
if you wanna come by.

26:12.919 --> 26:14.964
Talk, have a drink.

26:15.008 --> 26:16.879
- Yeah.

26:16.923 --> 26:19.621
- All right,
it's good to see you, man.

26:19.665 --> 26:21.754
- Good to see you, Brian.

26:22.972 --> 26:24.757
- Let's go.

26:33.635 --> 26:35.637
- You think I'm a hypocrite?

26:35.681 --> 26:37.813
Trying to get these guys
to testify when I won't even--

26:37.857 --> 26:39.641
- No, I don't think that.

26:39.685 --> 26:41.730
- I do.

26:41.774 --> 26:45.386
- Cards on the table.
What are you afraid of?

26:51.958 --> 26:53.655
- I told one person before you.

26:53.699 --> 26:56.440
This kid in High School,
he was a friend of mine.

26:56.484 --> 26:58.573
I didn't tell him
the whole story,

26:58.617 --> 27:01.620
I just told him Dolan
grabbed my junk, but,

27:01.663 --> 27:06.189
the look in his eyes?
I'll never forget that.

27:06.233 --> 27:09.149
- Cassidy, he was a kid.

27:09.192 --> 27:11.717
- You don't think I saw that
exact same look in your eyes?

27:11.760 --> 27:13.414
Huh?

27:15.503 --> 27:17.418
You're uncomfortable.

27:17.461 --> 27:18.724
- Yeah.

27:18.767 --> 27:20.029
I was new to SVU.

27:20.073 --> 27:21.596
I didn't know
how to handle that.

27:21.640 --> 27:24.120
- Yeah, exactly, just like
all the guys that I work with,

27:24.164 --> 27:26.166
and the guys
that I hang out with.

27:26.209 --> 27:27.471
Look, Rob and Leo, right?

27:27.515 --> 27:29.691
They get to go to New York,
testify,

27:29.735 --> 27:33.608
then they get to go back home
with all their secrets intact.

27:40.484 --> 27:43.270
Hey, Leo.

27:43.313 --> 27:45.054
- Hey.

27:47.448 --> 27:50.103
Guys down at the Sheraton
told me you might be here.

27:52.018 --> 27:57.240
When I got off work I saw
my son's drawing on the fridge.

27:57.284 --> 28:00.983
Just got me thinking,
you know?

28:01.027 --> 28:03.594
If it was Connor
that killed himself,

28:03.638 --> 28:06.119
someone out there
knew the truth,

28:06.162 --> 28:08.687
I'd want that person
to come forward.

28:10.776 --> 28:13.735
So, yeah.

28:13.779 --> 28:16.129
Yeah, Gary molested me.

28:19.785 --> 28:22.657
And I--I'll testify to it.

28:26.792 --> 28:28.445
- All right.

28:31.666 --> 28:34.016
- Hey.

28:34.060 --> 28:35.061
- Peter?
- Hey.

28:35.104 --> 28:36.453
- What's going on?

28:36.497 --> 28:39.848
- Leo Berry,
this is Lieutenant Benson.

28:39.892 --> 28:41.067
- Hi, Mr. Berry,
nice to meet you.

28:41.110 --> 28:42.198
- Nice to meet you.

28:42.242 --> 28:45.114
- Gary Dolan coached Leo
in 1985.

28:45.158 --> 28:50.076
- Um, I'm Detective Rollins.
Why don't you come have a seat?

28:50.119 --> 28:52.034
Do you mind?

28:53.601 --> 28:55.821
- How--
- I made a lot of phone calls.

28:55.864 --> 28:59.041
And with Leo's testimony about
Dolan's prior bad acts,

28:59.085 --> 29:01.783
at least we'll have a shot now.

29:01.827 --> 29:04.960
- Okay.

29:05.004 --> 29:08.311
He made a lot of phone calls?

29:08.355 --> 29:10.574
- That's what he said.

29:10.618 --> 29:13.577
- I called the regional
youth league office myself,

29:13.621 --> 29:15.884
and they told me that the team
rosters

29:15.928 --> 29:17.973
weren't computerized back then,

29:18.017 --> 29:21.281
and that the paper files
were long gone.

29:21.324 --> 29:22.586
- You want me to go
pick up Dolan?

29:22.630 --> 29:25.024
- No.

29:25.067 --> 29:27.200
You stay here with Mr. Berry.

29:34.076 --> 29:35.512
- We're closed.

29:35.556 --> 29:37.166
- Yeah, you been preying
on boys for 30 years.

29:37.210 --> 29:39.516
- Talk to my lawyer.
- Brian Cassidy.

29:39.560 --> 29:41.562
Hudson youth league.
- What about him?

29:41.605 --> 29:44.521
- Takes balls
to molest a cop's son.

29:44.565 --> 29:46.045
- I don't know
what you're talking about.

29:46.088 --> 29:47.263
- Or maybe you're just so sick

29:47.307 --> 29:48.569
that you couldn't help
yourself.

29:48.612 --> 29:50.049
Turn around.

29:51.224 --> 29:53.530
You're under arrest

29:53.574 --> 29:56.446
for sexual assault of Micah
Fuller and you're gonna pay

29:56.490 --> 29:58.144
for what you did
to Brian Cassidy.

29:58.187 --> 30:00.668
- Oh, good luck
making any of that stick.

30:00.711 --> 30:03.149
- You don't know me very well,
Dolan,

30:03.192 --> 30:07.501
but I don't give up ever.

30:07.544 --> 30:10.765
Especially when you hurt
somebody that I care about.

30:21.994 --> 30:24.213
Going somewhere?

30:24.257 --> 30:26.694
- Yeah, I'm going out of town
for a bit.

30:26.737 --> 30:29.523
- All these years
and I didn't see it?

30:29.566 --> 30:31.351
Why didn't you tell me, Brian?

30:31.394 --> 30:32.569
- Take a wild guess.

30:32.613 --> 30:34.397
- Was I that hard to talk to?

30:34.441 --> 30:36.660
- What, you want us to sit
around, and hold hands,

30:36.704 --> 30:38.227
and cry together, Liv?
Come on.

30:38.271 --> 30:39.489
- Brian, you're suffering.
Just talk to me.

30:39.533 --> 30:41.187
- Would you just let it go,
Liv?

30:41.230 --> 30:43.232
- I wanna--I wanna help you.
- Let it go.

30:43.276 --> 30:45.887
I'm not one of your survivors,
okay?

30:45.931 --> 30:47.367
I'm a cop, Liv.

30:47.410 --> 30:49.064
- I know that.
- Yeah, I'm a cop.

30:49.108 --> 30:51.414
Your pep talks,
your support groups,

30:51.458 --> 30:53.329
they're not gonna work
on me, all right?

30:53.373 --> 30:55.505
You know what, the best thing
would have been for us

30:55.549 --> 30:57.377
if you had never looked
at that baseball picture.

30:57.420 --> 30:59.553
- Brian, obviously I'm
saying the wrong thing here,

30:59.596 --> 31:00.902
I just--

31:00.946 --> 31:04.732
I just don't want you
to run away from this.

31:04.775 --> 31:06.429
- I'm not getting involved
in your case, Liv.

31:06.473 --> 31:08.257
- It's not about my case,
Brian.

31:08.301 --> 31:10.607
It's not about my case.

31:10.651 --> 31:12.261
I just--

31:12.305 --> 31:14.176
I care about you and I'm scared

31:14.220 --> 31:15.830
that if you don't deal with
this, Brian,

31:15.874 --> 31:19.442
that I'm gonna get a call one
day that you're the one

31:19.486 --> 31:21.880
who has
a plastic bag over his head.

31:24.143 --> 31:26.145
- I'm dealing with it.

31:31.150 --> 31:32.803
My way.

31:48.732 --> 31:51.039
- Something interesting going
on in that cup of coffee?

31:51.083 --> 31:52.823
- What's up?

31:52.867 --> 31:54.608
- You picked up
Dolan last night?

31:54.651 --> 31:57.132
- Yup.
- How'd that go?

31:57.176 --> 31:58.307
- Fine.

31:58.351 --> 31:59.961
- 'Cause the word from central
booking

32:00.005 --> 32:01.876
is that he was pretty
roughed up.

32:01.920 --> 32:04.139
Did he resist?
- Amanda.

32:07.969 --> 32:10.624
- I know about Cassidy.

32:12.365 --> 32:13.583
Stone let something slip

32:13.627 --> 32:16.499
and I figured it out
from there.

32:16.543 --> 32:19.589
- I lived with him, Amanda.

32:19.633 --> 32:21.765
I considered
having his children.

32:21.809 --> 32:25.073
- Yeah.
Don't beat yourself up.

32:25.117 --> 32:28.033
- He knows Stone for five
minutes and then he just

32:28.076 --> 32:29.817
opens up and tells him
the whole story?

32:29.860 --> 32:31.775
- That's why some people
go to bars.

32:31.819 --> 32:33.429
- I mean, I've told complete
strangers

32:33.473 --> 32:36.084
things I wouldn't even say
out loud to the people I love.

32:36.128 --> 32:38.434
You're a victim here.
You're allowed to hurt.

32:38.478 --> 32:43.352
- I tried to talk to him
and he just shut me down.

32:43.396 --> 32:45.441
- He's too raw.

32:45.485 --> 32:47.574
And I know you're not gonna
like hearing this but,

32:47.617 --> 32:51.186
he may be like a lot of victims
and may never face it.

32:56.148 --> 32:58.802
It's not on you
to take care of him.

33:16.646 --> 33:18.518
- One day after practice,

33:18.561 --> 33:21.042
Gary said
he would drive me home.

33:24.045 --> 33:28.745
My father just moved out so I
guess I was happy

33:28.789 --> 33:30.399
to get some
attention, I guess.

33:30.443 --> 33:32.010
- Then what happened.

33:32.053 --> 33:35.361
- We drove to a spot
near the river.

33:35.404 --> 33:37.667
It was, um,

33:37.711 --> 33:39.147
It was getting dark.

33:39.191 --> 33:43.325
Gary pulled out a bottle
of vodka from the glove box.

33:45.153 --> 33:48.504
He said it was what ball
players do

33:48.548 --> 33:51.681
after a good workout.

33:51.725 --> 33:54.206
So I drank it.

33:54.249 --> 33:57.905
And then he put his hand
on my thigh.

34:03.998 --> 34:06.305
He unzipped my pants.

34:12.702 --> 34:15.749
And he...

34:15.792 --> 34:18.143
Performed oral sex on me.

34:25.889 --> 34:28.762
Is that what ball players do,
Gary?

34:28.805 --> 34:31.025
- Easy, Mr. Berry.

34:32.548 --> 34:35.856
- Was that the only time
he performed a sex act on you?

34:38.598 --> 34:41.862
- The same thing went on

34:41.905 --> 34:44.952
after practice for a month.

34:44.995 --> 34:48.825
And then I--I--I quit the team.

34:48.869 --> 34:50.566
- Was there anything else that
Gary did

34:50.610 --> 34:53.221
during this time period, Leo?

34:53.265 --> 34:55.528
- Like what?

34:55.571 --> 34:58.835
Oh, yeah.

34:58.879 --> 35:00.881
He gave me a camera.

35:02.187 --> 35:06.060
He asked me to take pictures
of myself in my underwear.

35:06.104 --> 35:10.282
- Did you tell anyone
about any of this?

35:13.198 --> 35:14.416
- No.

35:17.202 --> 35:21.510
I wa--I was too ashamed.

35:25.079 --> 35:26.950
- Nothing further.

35:31.825 --> 35:34.697
- A family court in Rhode
Island found you legally unfit

35:34.741 --> 35:36.960
to parent your own child?

35:40.355 --> 35:42.183
- I had some problems in my
past.

35:42.227 --> 35:44.968
- Failed stint in rehab,
three DUIs,

35:45.012 --> 35:46.709
two felony assault arrests.

35:46.753 --> 35:48.363
- I--those were bar fights.

35:48.407 --> 35:51.932
- Did you drink
before coming to court today?

35:57.111 --> 36:00.332
- I had a couple shots
to calm my nerves.

36:00.375 --> 36:03.161
- Judge, this witness
is intoxicated.

36:03.204 --> 36:05.250
- What?
- Your honor, two drinks.

36:05.293 --> 36:07.034
Mr. Berry is perfectly lucid.

36:07.077 --> 36:09.471
- I move to strike
his entire testimony.

36:09.515 --> 36:12.213
- Approach, with respect.

36:12.257 --> 36:13.823
Do you think
this is easy for him?

36:13.867 --> 36:15.260
- No, I do not.

36:15.303 --> 36:16.870
But I'm not about to keep a
breathalyzer

36:16.913 --> 36:18.306
behind the bench

36:18.350 --> 36:20.917
and test every witness's
level of intoxication.

36:20.961 --> 36:23.659
The jury, disregard
Mr. Berry's testimony,

36:23.703 --> 36:26.009
and it's stricken
from the record.

36:37.412 --> 36:39.980
- Hey,
so that's your star witness?

36:40.023 --> 36:43.070
- He's gonna get away with what
he did to our son, isn't he?

36:43.113 --> 36:45.115
- This is far from over.

36:45.159 --> 36:47.857
Why don't the two of you
go and grab a cup of coffee

36:47.901 --> 36:49.555
just down the hallway and
I'll--

36:49.598 --> 36:51.513
I'll join you in a minute.

36:51.557 --> 36:53.385
- That was amazing.

37:01.349 --> 37:03.656
- You know, they're right.
Without this prior

37:03.699 --> 37:06.876
bad acts evidence, the case
never goes to the jury.

37:12.447 --> 37:15.494
- Hey, hey!
- Let's go. Let's go.

37:15.537 --> 37:16.495
- You remember me?

37:16.538 --> 37:17.757
Huh? You remember me?

37:17.800 --> 37:19.237
Back off, Liv!

37:19.280 --> 37:22.196
You know what? How many?
How many, asshole!

37:22.240 --> 37:26.113
Hey! Hey! How many souls
can you ruin in one lifetime?

37:26.156 --> 37:27.549
- Get ahold of yourself.
- Get your hands off me!

37:27.593 --> 37:30.117
- Stop now.

37:30.160 --> 37:33.555
Walk away, now.

37:33.599 --> 37:35.035
Brian.

37:35.078 --> 37:37.255
- Did you set up
this little reunion?

37:43.696 --> 37:46.264
- What are you doing here?

37:46.307 --> 37:49.397
What are you doing here?

37:49.441 --> 37:51.094
- How's Leo?

37:54.794 --> 37:59.364
- The judge just threw out
his testimony.

37:59.407 --> 38:01.104
- What?

38:01.148 --> 38:04.456
- Dolan is gonna walk away.

38:04.499 --> 38:06.153
Listen to me.

38:09.548 --> 38:12.420
You really wanna hurt this guy,
Brian?

38:12.464 --> 38:15.858
You really wanna make him pay
for what he did?

38:15.902 --> 38:19.427
Get on the stand.
Testify.

38:19.471 --> 38:22.517
That's how you can make him pay
for what he did.

38:22.561 --> 38:24.780
- And what happens if they
throw my testimony out--

38:24.824 --> 38:26.869
- It doesn't matter, Brian.

38:26.913 --> 38:28.306
This isn't about Micah,

38:28.349 --> 38:30.177
this isn't about
all the other guys.

38:30.220 --> 38:32.092
This is about you.

38:32.135 --> 38:35.617
Confronting him,
facing your demons.

38:35.661 --> 38:37.227
Brian.

38:39.839 --> 38:41.319
Come here.

38:41.362 --> 38:44.539
It's time to forgive that
little boy in the picture.

38:44.583 --> 38:49.022
The one that just--
just wanted his dad to see him.

38:49.065 --> 38:50.328
- Yeah.

38:50.371 --> 38:51.807
If he was here, right?

38:51.851 --> 38:54.810
- And if he was

38:54.854 --> 38:57.204
he'd be so proud of you.

38:59.032 --> 39:01.034
Like I am.

39:06.039 --> 39:09.869
You've come so far.

39:09.912 --> 39:12.132
I know that you can do this.

39:12.175 --> 39:14.221
I know you can.

39:28.540 --> 39:30.280
- All right.

39:44.033 --> 39:47.167
- Detective Cassidy.

39:47.210 --> 39:49.691
Please tell the jury
why you're here today.

39:54.435 --> 39:58.874
I'm here because I was
a victim of Gary Dolan.

39:58.918 --> 40:00.398
- Detective Cassidy,

40:00.441 --> 40:03.488
please raise your head
and speak up.

40:14.542 --> 40:17.415
I was a victim.

40:20.635 --> 40:25.248
Of Gary Dolan's.
He was, um...

40:25.292 --> 40:27.337
He was my coach.

40:29.296 --> 40:32.560
In Hudson youth league in 1985.

40:41.351 --> 40:48.141
And he sexually assaulted me.

40:48.184 --> 40:50.622
When I was 12 years old.
