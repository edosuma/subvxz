WEBVTT

00:03.719 --> 00:06.120
But I wanna read, too.
It's really off-putting.

00:06.160 --> 00:08.160
So what do I do, then?

00:08.200 --> 00:10.920
You bring your own scroll.
I forgot mine, though.

00:13.000 --> 00:16.680
If it were me, I'd open it up.
Come on, man, be sociable about it.

00:16.720 --> 00:19.760
I don't want to be sociable
when I'm reading... or shitting.

00:19.800 --> 00:22.120
That's the wrong attitude, dude.

00:22.160 --> 00:24.400
This isn't your average
in-and-out shit house.

00:24.440 --> 00:27.880
This is an executive
gentleman's toilet.

00:27.920 --> 00:30.600
What do you reckon, G man?
Does the job, doesn't it?

00:32.720 --> 00:34.440
Grumio, where did you get
that apple?

00:34.480 --> 00:37.560
Found it on the side there.
And now you're eating it, are you?

00:37.600 --> 00:39.600
Clear out one end, top up the other.

00:39.640 --> 00:43.160
That's really unhealthy. You're
always saying fruit's good for you.

00:43.200 --> 00:46.120
Not fruit you find in a toilet.
Bloody hell, I can't win.

00:46.160 --> 00:48.640
You can win. You don't eat
where you shit, famously.

00:48.680 --> 00:50.680
I thought it's don't shit
where you eat.

00:50.720 --> 00:52.720
Well, either way.

00:52.760 --> 00:54.600
Er... Marcus.
What?

00:54.640 --> 00:56.640
I forgot my sponge, too.

00:58.200 --> 01:00.200
Thanks, man.

01:00.521 --> 01:16.060
<font color="#3399CC">Subtitles by </font><font color="ffffff">MemoryOnSmells</font>
<font color="#3399CC">http://UKsubtitles.ru.</font>

01:16.680 --> 01:19.840
You stupid sod, Grumio.
Marcus, please,

01:19.880 --> 01:21.720
you shouldn't speak ill of the ill.

01:21.760 --> 01:24.960
But it's entirely his fault. Didn't
I say not to eat that bog apple?

01:25.000 --> 01:27.440
He did say. It weren't definitely
the bog apple.

01:27.480 --> 01:30.480
Course it was, wasn't it, doctor?
Your slave has all the symptoms

01:30.520 --> 01:33.440
of acute gastric infection.
Huh, and how would he have got that?

01:33.480 --> 01:36.400
Possibly from something he ate.
There we go. The bog apple.

01:36.440 --> 01:38.480
In your face.
It is fairly serious.

01:38.520 --> 01:41.080
Yeah. Yeah, sure. How do I fix him?

01:41.120 --> 01:43.680
With plenty of rest.
Cool. I'm all over that.

01:43.720 --> 01:46.000
And a herbal remedy
made from silphium extract.

01:46.040 --> 01:49.080
It'll bring down his temperature
and stabilise his gut.

01:51.160 --> 01:53.880
OK, and where do we buy that?

01:53.920 --> 01:56.240
Well, actually,
I happen to have some in stock.

01:56.280 --> 01:58.600
Are you all right?

01:58.640 --> 02:01.480
Well, this quack's clearly
trying to fleece us, isn't he?

02:01.520 --> 02:03.600
When it's perfectly obvious
what's happened.

02:03.640 --> 02:06.040
Yes. Grumio's eaten pooey fruit.

02:06.080 --> 02:09.639
Exactly. And offended
Hygeia Goddess of Being Clean.

02:09.680 --> 02:13.560
Right. To be fair, he has been
offending her for quite some time.

02:13.600 --> 02:16.040
Well, there you go.
She's finally snapped.

02:16.080 --> 02:18.960
We need to ask for her forgiveness
and maybe do a vigil.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
Not stuff him with herbs.

02:21.040 --> 02:24.200
Silphium is used by the army
to fight infection.

02:24.240 --> 02:27.880
That's pretty convincing. We need
to pray together by candle light.

02:27.920 --> 02:29.760
Also convincing.

02:29.800 --> 02:31.800
Obviously it's your decision.

02:31.840 --> 02:33.800
I'd rather go with
what the grownup says.

02:33.840 --> 02:36.800
Well, how much is the medicine?
200 dinari.

02:36.840 --> 02:41.120
Yeah. I think we're gonna go with
the prayer and candles, on balance.

02:41.160 --> 02:43.160
Great. Hygeia be praised.

02:43.200 --> 02:45.920
What?
Well, best of luck, then.

02:47.200 --> 02:49.440
Excuse me. Excuse me.

02:49.480 --> 02:51.920
You stingy bastard.
Language, Grumio.

02:51.960 --> 02:54.840
You don't want to offend
any more Gods now, do you?

03:00.720 --> 03:02.640
Salve.

03:04.000 --> 03:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:27.800 --> 03:29.800
Oh, thank you.
Pleasure.

03:31.440 --> 03:33.720
Do you race?
Can do.

03:33.760 --> 03:35.560
I mean, I've been here
for quite a while

03:35.600 --> 03:37.840
so I've got a bit of a head start.
Chariots.

03:37.880 --> 03:39.800
Do you race chariots?
Oh, right.

03:39.840 --> 03:42.080
Er... yeah, sort of, planning to.

03:42.120 --> 03:44.120
This is like an idiot's guide.

03:44.160 --> 03:46.960
Right. Well, you certainly
don't look like an idiot.

03:47.000 --> 03:51.280
Well, I've read most of it now so
maybe I'm three levels above idiot.

03:51.320 --> 03:53.840
Glad to hear it.

03:53.880 --> 03:57.120
I'm Stylax, by the way.
Gaius. Very pleased to meet you.

03:57.160 --> 03:59.000
Ooh.
What?

03:59.040 --> 04:01.800
You've got a great grip, Stylax.
Thank you very much.

04:01.840 --> 04:04.880
Did someone teach you that?
No, that's just the way I do it.

04:04.920 --> 04:08.960
Because that's the secret to
horsemanship, you realise. Grip.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
Well, maybe I'm a natural.

04:11.040 --> 04:13.040
Maybe you are.

04:41.160 --> 04:43.640
I have had the best day ever.

04:43.680 --> 04:45.400
Me, too. Where were you?

04:45.440 --> 04:47.560
You never came back
from your afternoon poo.

04:47.600 --> 04:50.280
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo. That's a bit...
Good, isn't it?

04:50.320 --> 04:53.240
Why do people go to the gym
when you can just get one of these?

04:53.280 --> 04:55.840
Is that how many muscles
I'm meant to have? I guess so.

04:55.880 --> 04:58.960
That's depressing. Where's it from?
It was a gift. I met someone.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.760
That's why I had to skive off work.
Course you did. Who is she?

05:01.800 --> 05:03.960
No, it's a he.
What? A he?

05:04.000 --> 05:06.480
Yeah, it's this cool older guy
called Gaius Maecenas.

05:06.520 --> 05:08.920
He thinks I've got huge potential
as a charioteer.

05:08.960 --> 05:11.280
He bought me the metal muscles
for when I race.

05:11.320 --> 05:13.320
Right. That's very weird.

05:13.360 --> 05:16.520
Er... no it isn't. We just got talking
in the bogs, hit it off.

05:16.560 --> 05:18.840
The bogs? Are you serious?
Yeah, why?

05:18.880 --> 05:21.320
Well, he's clearly gay,
this is a gay thing. As if.

05:21.360 --> 05:24.640
You met an older man in a place
where you had your genitals out.

05:24.680 --> 05:26.600
And he then buys you
homo erotic gifts.

05:26.640 --> 05:28.720
Nah. One, I chose this.

05:28.760 --> 05:32.640
Two, it's not homo erotic,
it's manly. Clearly.

05:32.680 --> 05:35.880
Mm. It's a fine line. I suggest
you avoid him from now on.

05:35.920 --> 05:37.600
No, he wants to be my patron.

05:37.640 --> 05:39.960
He's gonna pay for my chariot
lessons. Right, yeah.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.040
And he will expect
to be repaid thoroughly.

05:42.080 --> 05:44.080
Ha-ha-ha. You're just jealous.

05:44.120 --> 05:47.080
Plus, he gave me some pocket money
to tide me over.

05:47.120 --> 05:49.440
Oh, my Jove.
Yeah, I know.

05:49.480 --> 05:52.280
Marcus, my sick pot's almost full.

05:52.320 --> 05:54.360
So stop being sick, then.

05:54.400 --> 05:56.600
Oh. I could get Grumio his medicine.

05:56.640 --> 05:58.840
Yeah. I'd prefer to hold off
on that, actually.

05:58.880 --> 06:02.200
Me and Cynthia are doing a vigil.
Oh, right. But will that work?

06:02.240 --> 06:04.760
I hope so. There's a real spark
between us at the moment.

06:04.800 --> 06:06.600
I mean will it work for Grumio?

06:06.640 --> 06:08.480
Oh, right, yeah. Dunno. Maybe.

06:08.520 --> 06:11.080
Anyway, he's over the worst of it.

06:13.040 --> 06:15.040
As of now.

06:22.520 --> 06:24.680
Divine Hygeia, you are so great.

06:24.720 --> 06:26.880
Divine Hygeia, you are so great.

06:26.920 --> 06:31.320
Please heal this dirty man
who has turned his back on you.

06:31.360 --> 06:33.400
Slow, steady breaths, Marcus.

06:34.320 --> 06:37.520
Yep. And maybe we should hold hands?

06:37.560 --> 06:40.280
Sort of combine our powers.
Oh, good idea.

06:43.600 --> 06:46.400
Can you feel it working?
Oh, yeah.

07:02.040 --> 07:03.840
Er... I'm still here.

07:03.880 --> 07:06.280
Sorry, the vigil.
We must be vigilant.

07:06.320 --> 07:08.040
Yes, of course.

07:08.080 --> 07:12.280
Divine Hygeia, you are so great.
Divine Hygeia, you are so great.

07:16.760 --> 07:19.400
I knew you'd crack it.
Didn't I tell you not to give up?

07:19.440 --> 07:21.840
You told me I should give up,
as it goes, but cheers.

07:21.880 --> 07:24.120
I presume you drugged her?
You presume wrong.

07:24.160 --> 07:26.320
Turns out religion can be very sexy.

07:26.360 --> 07:29.600
The candle light, the petals.
The stench of Grumio's vom!

07:29.640 --> 07:31.560
Yeah, we managed to block that out.

07:31.600 --> 07:33.560
Our eyes locked
and there was this moment

07:33.600 --> 07:35.440
and I just knew what I had to do.

07:35.480 --> 07:38.360
We'd have kept going if Grumio
hasn't started hacking up bile,

07:38.400 --> 07:41.200
the inconsiderate sod.
'Ey, 'ey, he's seriously ill, dude.

07:41.240 --> 07:43.000
He's milking it.
Where are you going?

07:43.040 --> 07:44.720
I've got to bounce. Cover for me.

07:44.760 --> 07:46.560
You're not meeting
the gaytron again?

07:46.600 --> 07:49.400
Patron. He's my patron.
What? Why have you got a patron?

07:49.440 --> 07:52.640
Because the guy wants to bum him.
Oh, right, well, that's fine, then.

07:52.680 --> 07:55.680
No. No. He thinks I'm gonna
be a great charioteer.

07:55.720 --> 07:57.560
Has he ever seen you race?
Well, no.

07:57.600 --> 07:59.400
But he used to do it
back in the day, so -

07:59.440 --> 08:01.200
So he can tell
just by looking at you?

08:01.240 --> 08:03.000
He can see a bit of himself in me,
yes.

08:03.040 --> 08:05.720
Which bit of himself?
Probably his knob or his fist.

08:05.760 --> 08:08.600
Me and Gaius are just friends.
Or both his fists. Or his head.

08:08.640 --> 08:12.280
Just getting it right up in there
till he's wearing you like a hat.

08:14.440 --> 08:16.440
Take the hat off.
Yes, sorry.

08:16.480 --> 08:18.360
I'm not actually wearing one.

08:18.400 --> 08:20.880
Oh, Shredder, you've decided
to come in today.

08:20.920 --> 08:23.320
What a treat.
Actually, I've just got to nip out.

08:23.360 --> 08:26.920
Nip out? Nip out where?
To a shredding convention.

08:26.960 --> 08:28.800
Well, that's a lie. Water boy?

08:28.840 --> 08:31.360
He's going to see his gay patron.
Gaytron.

08:31.400 --> 08:33.120
Patron.
Water man.

08:33.159 --> 08:36.120
I see. Well, you're not doing that,
obviously.

08:36.159 --> 08:39.200
In fact, I'd like you to nip out
and go to my dermatologist

08:39.240 --> 08:41.240
to pick up my facial mud pack.

08:41.280 --> 08:43.799
That's not in my job description.
Job description?

08:43.840 --> 08:46.080
Let me describe your job to you,
Shredder.

08:46.120 --> 08:50.160
Shut-y mouth, rip-y paper
and do-ey what I say-ey.

08:50.200 --> 08:52.040
No. I won't.

08:52.080 --> 08:54.880
I've met someone who believes in me
and pays me good money,

08:54.920 --> 08:57.600
so you can take your job
and shove it up your arse!

09:03.440 --> 09:06.080
On behalf of the department,
I'd like to apologise.

09:06.120 --> 09:08.840
Oh, you're representing
the department now, are you?

09:08.880 --> 09:11.360
I...yes, I... Oh!

09:11.400 --> 09:13.400
Then that's for you.

09:15.120 --> 09:17.120
Ooh. Oh.

09:24.240 --> 09:26.800
Salve, Grumio.
All right, Landlord.

09:26.840 --> 09:29.440
Phew! It's pretty funky in here,
innit?

09:29.480 --> 09:31.520
I know, I'm funking
out of every hole.

09:31.560 --> 09:33.560
Well, in that case,
it might be a good time

09:33.600 --> 09:35.840
to think about getting
some life insurance.

09:35.880 --> 09:39.320
Cool. How does that work, then?
Easy. You pay me 25 dinari,

09:39.360 --> 09:41.360
then if you die, you get 10,000.

09:41.400 --> 09:43.120
Bloody hell.
I know.

09:43.160 --> 09:46.120
What if I don't die? You get nothing,
but you will be alive,

09:46.160 --> 09:49.160
so, you know, it's a win-win.
Wicked. Can I stick it on the rent?

09:49.200 --> 09:51.200
Consider it done.

09:53.280 --> 09:55.280
Ten grand, here we come.

10:22.840 --> 10:25.200
Why are you out of bed?
Feeling better, aren't I?

10:25.240 --> 10:27.240
Looks like Hygeia
let me off the hook.

10:27.280 --> 10:29.720
Ha-ha-ha. Don't give me that.
What really happened?

10:29.760 --> 10:32.200
Stylax bought me the medicine
with his pocket money.

10:32.240 --> 10:34.560
Turns out someone gives a shit
about me after all.

10:34.600 --> 10:38.160
OK, great. I'm planning another
vigil so I need you back in bed.

10:38.200 --> 10:41.440
I'm not really up for another
one of your grubby threesomes, ta.

10:41.480 --> 10:43.320
I don't get much out of it.

10:43.360 --> 10:46.960
Grumio, don't be selfish, mate.
Me selfish? I could have died.

10:47.000 --> 10:50.440
What?! It was only a dicky tummy.
Not that you'd have noticed.

10:50.480 --> 10:52.920
You'd have happily bummed her
on top of my corpse.

10:52.960 --> 10:55.160
Just get back in bed.
Nah.

10:56.240 --> 10:58.760
Think I'll go for a jog.
Grumio, I could...

10:58.800 --> 11:01.480
Ooh. What's the matter, Marcus?

11:01.520 --> 11:03.520
Nothing. I'm...

11:03.560 --> 11:05.560
Ooh.
Oh, I think I'm gonna...

11:08.960 --> 11:10.960
You little belter.

11:22.920 --> 11:26.360
Well, I feel like a teenage boy.

11:26.400 --> 11:28.400
What, now?
I'm so loose.

11:28.440 --> 11:31.640
Oh, right, yeah, me too.
Oh, it's been a great day, Stylax.

11:31.680 --> 11:33.720
Yeah. Thanks for paying for it.

11:33.760 --> 11:36.680
You're really coming along.
You keep improving like this

11:36.720 --> 11:38.920
and in a few weeks,
I'm gonna enter you.

11:38.960 --> 11:40.720
What, sorry?
In a race.

11:40.760 --> 11:43.720
Oh. In the regions at first,
but soon you'll be ready for Rome.

11:43.760 --> 11:45.600
Oh, wow! You think so?

11:45.640 --> 11:47.760
With me behind you,
you could be huge.

11:48.560 --> 11:51.200
As long as you're prepared
to do what it takes?

11:51.240 --> 11:54.840
I'm giving you my patronage,
but you'll have to go all out.

11:57.040 --> 11:58.840
Do you understand?

12:00.800 --> 12:02.720
What the hell are you doing?

12:02.760 --> 12:04.720
I thought... Sorry.
I'm a married man.

12:04.760 --> 12:06.560
Are you?
And a father of three.

12:06.600 --> 12:09.400
I'm really sorry. No. No,
you've completely misjudged this.

12:09.440 --> 12:11.440
I just care about the racing.
Oh, no, me too.

12:11.480 --> 12:14.160
I'm not gay. I just thought you -
Well, you thought wrong. No.

12:14.200 --> 12:16.320
No, this isn't gonna work.
No, no, no, no.

12:16.360 --> 12:18.840
I've got to get out of here.
I'm really sorry.

12:30.960 --> 12:33.120
That's it, champ.
Better out than in.

12:39.106 --> 12:40.886
Shouldn't you be making that noise?

12:40.908 --> 12:44.068
It's his turn now. And he's being
a right drama queen about it.

12:44.085 --> 12:47.365
I don't understand. I've got nothing
left to give and it just keeps...

12:47.405 --> 12:50.285
Been there, done that,
got it on the tunic.

12:53.402 --> 12:55.522
Whoa. You all right?

12:55.562 --> 12:58.442
I think I just chucked up
an organ.

12:58.482 --> 13:00.682
See what I mean? Bloody diva.

13:00.722 --> 13:03.042
Just when I was getting somewhere
with Cynthia.

13:03.082 --> 13:05.882
Yeah. I wouldn't let her see you
like this, dude. I have to.

13:05.922 --> 13:09.602
I've got to keep the flame alive.
It's taken a year to get this far.

13:09.722 --> 13:12.722
No, but you look really rough
and you stink of death.

13:12.762 --> 13:15.802
Really?
And cabbage.

13:15.842 --> 13:17.962
OK, well, go and get
some more medicine.

13:18.002 --> 13:20.482
Ah. Nay. Spent all the pocket money.

13:20.522 --> 13:23.482
So go and get some more off your
sugar daddy. Can't. It's over.

13:23.522 --> 13:27.362
It's over? Why is it over?
Well, I sort of... lunged.

13:27.402 --> 13:31.162
You lunged? I went at him like
a goose but he didn't like it.

13:31.202 --> 13:33.642
Why did you lunge?
Because of you, because you said.

13:33.682 --> 13:36.602
I didn't say to do that. You kept
saying he was expecting stuff

13:36.642 --> 13:38.882
so I thought I had to.
And there was this moment.

13:38.922 --> 13:40.962
Like your moment,
where our eyes locked.

13:41.002 --> 13:43.762
Brilliant.
Anyway, who needs medicine?

13:43.802 --> 13:46.442
It's only a dicky tummy!
Oh, piss off, Grumio.

13:46.482 --> 13:50.082
This is way worse than what you had.
Go and ask Flavia for an advance.

13:50.122 --> 13:52.002
I can't. I quit, remember.
So un-quit.

13:52.042 --> 13:54.562
If I don't shake this illness,
Cynthia might go off me,

13:54.602 --> 13:56.482
which'll be a disaster.
And I might die.

13:56.522 --> 13:58.802
Also pretty bad. Oh.

13:58.842 --> 14:00.842
Oh, oh, oh, 'ey up.

14:03.522 --> 14:07.242
Don't sweat it, boss. A couple of
vigils and you'll be right as rain.

14:26.922 --> 14:29.002
Hey. Is Cynthia in?

14:29.042 --> 14:31.322
Why does it smell of sick?
Have you been sick?

14:31.362 --> 14:33.482
A bit, but just in my mouth
so it doesn't count.

14:33.522 --> 14:36.842
Oh, have you got the lurgy, as well?
Hmm. Try not to be too upset.

14:36.882 --> 14:38.882
What do you mean, 'as well'?

14:39.762 --> 14:41.642
Oh, no. Have you got it, too?

14:41.682 --> 14:43.922
We must have done something
to offend Hygeia.

14:43.962 --> 14:46.402
Do you think it was when
you kissed me during the vigil?

14:46.442 --> 14:49.162
That does sound offensive.
Will you go away, please, mate?

14:49.202 --> 14:51.562
Gladly.
Definitely wasn't that.

14:51.602 --> 14:54.242
For one thing, Grumio's better,
anyway. It worked!

14:54.282 --> 14:56.842
Hygeia, be praised.
Exactly. Hygeia, be praised.

14:56.882 --> 14:58.922
So what you up to later?

14:58.962 --> 15:01.602
I was planning on spending the day
in bed. Hm, perfect.

15:01.642 --> 15:03.562
I need a vigil, Marcus, not a date.

15:03.602 --> 15:06.282
No, course. Hopefully,
Hygeia will be as kind to us

15:06.322 --> 15:09.362
as she was to Grumio. Well, how
about a joint vigil at my place,

15:09.402 --> 15:12.362
so Hygeia only has to make one
visit. I'm sure she's very busy.

15:12.402 --> 15:16.482
OK. Good idea.
Cool. And later, who knows?

15:17.202 --> 15:19.962
Oh, my hands are very clammy,
Marcus. It's fine, so are mine.

15:20.002 --> 15:21.922
And I've just been sick.
Again, so have I.

15:21.962 --> 15:24.042
And I've got terrible diarrhoea.

15:24.082 --> 15:26.082
Er... yeah, see you later, then.

15:35.202 --> 15:38.842
And he comes crawling back to me.

15:38.882 --> 15:40.922
I'm sorry.
I bet.

15:40.962 --> 15:42.962
I got you the mud pack.

15:45.122 --> 15:47.282
Is that from my dermatologist?

15:47.322 --> 15:50.402
Uh, yeah. So could I have my job
back, then?

15:50.442 --> 15:52.122
I don't know, Shredder, can you?

15:52.162 --> 15:54.802
Cos the last I heard, your job
had been shoved up my arse.

15:54.842 --> 15:59.362
I'm really sorry about that.
Not placed or slid, but shoved.

15:59.402 --> 16:03.282
So is there any way
we could fish it out?

16:03.322 --> 16:06.602
Well, I rather think that depends
on how well you fish, doesn't it?

16:07.402 --> 16:10.042
Sorry, you want me to...?
Fish.

16:10.082 --> 16:12.482
Right.

16:12.522 --> 16:15.602
Firstly, I love working here.

16:16.882 --> 16:20.202
And I think you're great, both as
a boss and as a general person.

16:20.242 --> 16:22.242
What's the magic word, Shredder?

16:22.282 --> 16:24.362
Thin. You're really thin.

16:24.402 --> 16:26.962
Well, that's not what I meant,
but carry on.

16:27.002 --> 16:32.162
And your skin's all soft and tight
like a drum made of peaches.

16:32.202 --> 16:35.122
Mm, I like that.
And if I was 20 years older -

16:35.162 --> 16:37.362
20?!
Ten.

16:37.402 --> 16:39.362
Five. One.

16:39.402 --> 16:41.522
Next year, I'm gonna be all over you.

16:41.562 --> 16:44.762
I'm not gonna be able to stop myself
in the corridor, in the toilets -

16:44.802 --> 16:46.402
All right, that's enough.

16:46.442 --> 16:49.082
Kindly don't threaten me
with sexual assault. Sorry.

16:49.122 --> 16:51.242
So can I have my job back, then,
please?

16:51.282 --> 16:53.082
Fine.

16:53.122 --> 16:55.522
Piss off before I change my mind.
Thank you.

16:56.522 --> 16:59.482
Is there any way I could get
an advance on my salary?

16:59.522 --> 17:01.522
Get out.

17:12.122 --> 17:14.722
Ah, Stylax, thank the Gods
I've found you.

17:14.762 --> 17:16.561
Oh, Gaius. Hi.

17:16.602 --> 17:19.801
I told my wife about our incident
in the spa.

17:19.842 --> 17:22.442
Yeah, look, I'm sorry about that.
Oh, no, don't be.

17:22.482 --> 17:24.402
I've left her.
You've what?

17:24.442 --> 17:28.482
So sorry I rebuffed you,
you brave, beautiful boy.

17:28.521 --> 17:31.002
I was so stupid, I-I couldn't see
what was happening.

17:31.042 --> 17:32.962
I couldn't accept
what I was feeling.

17:33.002 --> 17:34.842
Shit, you've left her?
It wasn't easy.

17:34.882 --> 17:37.682
She was screaming with wild fury
and the kids were crying.

17:37.722 --> 17:39.642
I told them,
'Daddy loves you very much

17:39.682 --> 17:41.562
but he yearns to be with Stylax.'

17:43.442 --> 17:46.002
The thing is... I'm not gay.

17:46.042 --> 17:48.642
Yes, neither am I.

17:49.642 --> 17:51.522
Yeah, but I'm actually not.

17:51.562 --> 17:53.642
Look, we don't need to fight this
any more.

17:53.682 --> 17:57.282
Let's just get out of this town.
I've got a villa we can go to

17:57.322 --> 17:59.362
on Lake Como.
Sorry, Lake where?

17:59.402 --> 18:01.562
Lake Como.
And again?

18:01.602 --> 18:03.922
Lake Como.
I'm still hearing Lake Homo.

18:03.962 --> 18:06.002
Yeah, that's what I said, Lake Como.

18:06.042 --> 18:08.202
We could go tonight.
I believe in you.

18:08.242 --> 18:11.722
I want to drop everything
and back you to the hilt.

18:11.762 --> 18:13.762
What do you say?

18:13.802 --> 18:15.722
You have to go.
Are you mad?

18:15.762 --> 18:18.442
If Flavia won't give you
the advance, then we need him.

18:18.482 --> 18:20.322
He wants to take me to Lake Homo.

18:20.362 --> 18:24.042
It's Como. Como with a C.
He's not saying the C.

18:24.082 --> 18:27.362
I mean, this is serious, man,
he wants to back me to the hilt!

18:27.402 --> 18:29.122
I need that medicine, though.

18:29.162 --> 18:32.762
Knock, knock. Thought I'd drop by
and see the patient.

18:32.802 --> 18:35.202
Are those grapes for me?
Oh, no, no.

18:35.242 --> 18:37.482
OK, well, thanks for your concern.

18:37.522 --> 18:40.402
Oh, no, I'm very concerned.
I've had tenants die on me before

18:40.442 --> 18:43.602
and I don't mind telling you it's
a nightmare getting bills settled.

18:43.642 --> 18:45.642
But I've settled my bills.
Not all of them.

18:45.682 --> 18:48.242
You owe me 25 dinari for Grumio's
life insurance policy.

18:48.282 --> 18:50.562
What? The little turd.
I'm gonna bloody kill him.

18:50.602 --> 18:52.842
Best not, actually,
he's not covered for that.

18:52.882 --> 18:55.842
Pay up before you croak or I'll sell
your corpse to the pig farm.

18:55.882 --> 18:57.922
Tra, then. And be lucky.

18:58.962 --> 19:00.922
Please don't let me croak.

19:00.962 --> 19:02.802
Landlord will feed me to pigs.

19:02.842 --> 19:06.682
Yeah, but you'll be dead,
you won't even notice.

19:06.722 --> 19:10.802
I need that medicine, mate.
Please go to Lake Homo for me.

19:10.842 --> 19:13.362
Just take one for the team.

19:13.402 --> 19:17.722
It'll be more than one.
Please, mate, I'd do it for you.

19:37.402 --> 19:39.402
I'll have this one, ta.

19:40.842 --> 19:43.402
I'm really cold.
Here.

19:44.562 --> 19:46.762
Ooh. You're even colder.

19:46.802 --> 19:48.642
So this is how we warm up.

19:48.682 --> 19:50.722
Not now, Marcus,
seeing as we might die.

19:50.762 --> 19:54.162
Well, exactly. If we're gonna die,
we should really go for it.

19:54.202 --> 19:56.282
Could be our last chance.

19:56.322 --> 19:58.522
I don't think I can go for it.

19:58.562 --> 20:01.842
So maybe just lie there
and let me go for it?

20:01.882 --> 20:04.122
Right.

20:04.162 --> 20:06.162
Who's up for a vigil?

20:06.202 --> 20:08.442
Oh, Grumio,
you've got so much stuff.

20:08.482 --> 20:10.282
Well, it's the least I could do.

20:10.322 --> 20:12.682
You two really went for it over me.

20:12.722 --> 20:15.962
He's so adorable.
Isn't he adorable, Marcus?

20:16.002 --> 20:17.762
Yeah.

20:17.802 --> 20:20.922
Goddess Hygeia,
this is Grumio speaking.

20:20.962 --> 20:22.842
Evening.

20:29.002 --> 20:30.962
How do you play this again?

20:31.002 --> 20:33.322
I don't know, I thought you knew.
No, no idea.

20:33.362 --> 20:36.322
Right, well, let's go do
something else, then.

20:36.362 --> 20:38.362
Please forgive their dirtiness.

20:38.402 --> 20:42.082
This one may look clean, but he's
got muck stuffed in his head.

20:42.122 --> 20:44.842
Like a poo in a shoe.

20:46.202 --> 20:48.402
What?

20:48.442 --> 20:50.762
OK, that's enough.
Let him work, Marcus.

20:50.802 --> 20:53.322
It could be our only hope.
Hygeia, be praised.

20:53.362 --> 20:55.362
Hygeia, be praised.

20:55.402 --> 20:58.762
You not going to splash her face,
as well? No, just yours.

20:58.802 --> 21:00.722
Right, that'll do.

21:00.762 --> 21:03.282
What the hell are you doing?
You can't just burst in here

21:03.322 --> 21:05.922
blowing out candles like it's
your bloody birthday.

21:05.962 --> 21:07.602
I bought the medicine.
What?!

21:07.642 --> 21:10.922
I suggest you just take it before
you do yourselves some real damage.

21:10.962 --> 21:12.922
No way.
Well. Definitely no way?

21:12.962 --> 21:14.962
Of course. We're mid-vigil.

21:15.002 --> 21:17.162
I'm vigil-ing my arse off over here.
Exactly.

21:17.202 --> 21:20.322
If it worked for Grumio, it will
work for us. Right, Marcus?

21:20.362 --> 21:22.242
Is that right, Marcus?

21:22.282 --> 21:24.282
Yes, yes it is.

21:24.322 --> 21:27.162
Hygeia, be praised.
Hygeia, be praised.

21:31.122 --> 21:33.202
What? What are you doing?

21:33.242 --> 21:35.522
It was the medicine.

21:35.562 --> 21:37.482
Grumio took the medicine.

21:37.522 --> 21:39.402
Of course the vigil
doesn't do anything.

21:39.442 --> 21:41.442
How could this possibly do anything?

21:41.482 --> 21:44.002
Apart from make you look like
a stupid prick.

21:45.202 --> 21:47.002
I see.

21:47.042 --> 21:50.002
Ah, no. That said,
you're not a stupid prick.

21:50.042 --> 21:52.762
You're wonderful. Don't go.
Where you going?

21:52.802 --> 21:57.522
I'm going to pray on my own,
away from this den of filth.

21:57.562 --> 21:59.602
So why are you taking that?

22:00.602 --> 22:02.602
I'm going to pour it away.

22:12.282 --> 22:16.082
Ah, well, you know what they say.
At least you've got your health.

22:20.442 --> 22:22.362
You seen Stylax anywhere?

22:22.402 --> 22:25.602
I should probably tell him I don't
need that money any more.

22:36.842 --> 22:39.242
I-I'm sorry, I can't.

22:41.402 --> 22:43.442
Stylax, where you going?!

22:45.242 --> 22:47.322
Stylax!

22:47.362 --> 22:49.362
Stylax!

22:49.959 --> 23:25.013
