WEBVTT

00:01.697 --> 00:04.047
Previously onDynasty...I can't do this anymore.

00:04.091 --> 00:05.266
I love Culhane.

00:05.309 --> 00:07.355
I just had this
very disturbing conversation

00:07.398 --> 00:09.618
with the head of Steven's
foundation. He's missing.

00:09.661 --> 00:10.923
BLAKE:
Cristal?

00:10.967 --> 00:12.360
Now, I know you didn't want

00:12.403 --> 00:13.883
an engagement gift,
but I got you something simple.

00:13.926 --> 00:15.232
You bought a soccer team?

00:15.276 --> 00:18.235
This is all the blackmail
on Fallon and Jeff Colby.

00:18.279 --> 00:19.845
And as a bonus,
$5 million cash.

00:19.889 --> 00:21.151
You can walk away from me
for good.

00:21.195 --> 00:22.152
MICHAEL:
Nico.

00:22.196 --> 00:23.632
You must be Ada's new guy.

00:23.675 --> 00:24.981
Welcome to the fold.

00:25.025 --> 00:26.548
Who the hell is this?
It was all a setup!

00:26.591 --> 00:27.418
Look out, Jeff!

00:28.941 --> 00:30.030
Jeff?

00:30.073 --> 00:31.335
Just stay with me, Jeff.

00:32.554 --> 00:35.861
Blake, I'm gonna need your help.

00:47.351 --> 00:49.005
MONICA:
When is he gonna wake up?

00:49.049 --> 00:51.486
I know it seems
like a long time,

00:51.529 --> 00:53.792
but when dealing
with bullet wounds,

00:53.836 --> 00:55.577
the body needs time
to recover.

00:55.620 --> 00:58.101
What took you so long
to call me in the first place?

00:58.145 --> 01:00.103
Did you have to call
your lawyers first?

01:00.147 --> 01:01.844
I know you're stressed,
but if there's anyone

01:01.887 --> 01:03.324
that can pull through this,
it's Jeff.

01:10.070 --> 01:11.636
Where should we set up
breakfast, Mr. Carrington?

01:11.680 --> 01:15.118
In the dining room,
where it belongs.

01:15.162 --> 01:16.424
And please tell the rest
of the staff this room

01:16.467 --> 01:17.860
is off-limits
until further notice.

01:17.903 --> 01:19.166
SERVANT:
Yes, sir.Did my brother know

01:19.209 --> 01:20.515
you were bringing him
to your guest room

01:20.558 --> 01:21.994
instead of an actual hospital?

01:22.038 --> 01:24.127
Believe me,
there was no other choice.

01:24.171 --> 01:27.696
You, Blake, should never start
a sentence with "believe me."

01:27.739 --> 01:30.394
When your brother wakes, I'll
let him tell you why he's here.

01:30.438 --> 01:32.309
In the meantime, if there's
anything else you need,

01:32.353 --> 01:35.312
please let me know.

01:35.356 --> 01:36.357
Hey.

01:36.400 --> 01:37.836
Hey.

01:40.187 --> 01:42.145
How's he doing?
Who knows?

01:42.189 --> 01:44.452
I can't get a straight answer
out of anyone.

01:44.495 --> 01:45.714
Where the hell is Culhane?

01:45.757 --> 01:48.064
Well, just so you know,
he feels awful.

01:48.108 --> 01:49.718
Of course he does.
This is all his fault.

01:49.761 --> 01:51.763
My brother is still unconscious,
and from what I hear,

01:51.807 --> 01:53.330
Culhane barely has a scratch.

01:53.374 --> 01:55.027
I'm not going to defend him,

01:55.071 --> 01:57.900
but, I mean, I don't think
he'd crash his car on purpose.

01:57.943 --> 02:00.816
Right. Because he always
tells the truth.

02:00.859 --> 02:02.687
And what about you?

02:02.731 --> 02:04.907
You knew all about his secret
life of crime and you didn't say

02:04.950 --> 02:07.214
anything to me.Culhane was supposed to tell you

02:07.257 --> 02:09.085
everything about Ada.

02:09.129 --> 02:11.000
I'm not the one you can't trust.

02:13.785 --> 02:15.309
Fallon, I've told you
a hundred times now.

02:15.352 --> 02:18.616
I had no choice.
Everything that I did was...

02:18.660 --> 02:20.140
To protect me. Yes, I know.

02:20.183 --> 02:21.750
It was.

02:21.793 --> 02:24.144
I did what I had to do to get
that blackmail back from Ada.

02:24.187 --> 02:26.015
The less you knew,
the better.

02:26.058 --> 02:27.451
So you just lied to my face.

02:27.495 --> 02:28.757
This face.

02:28.800 --> 02:30.280
This face that you could still
be lying to now.

02:30.324 --> 02:33.501
Uh, Fallon, I didn't start
any of this.

02:33.544 --> 02:36.460
If it wasn't for your
crazy escort plan

02:36.504 --> 02:39.115
that got Max Van Kirk killed,
none of this would've happened.

02:39.159 --> 02:41.639
And that's it?
That's everything?

02:41.683 --> 02:44.076
Yes.

02:44.120 --> 02:48.124
I promise you, and your perfect
face, that's the whole truth.

02:49.473 --> 02:51.954
But we still have
that Nico problem.

02:51.997 --> 02:54.696
It's the Van Kirk Industries guy
that was at the drug deal.

02:54.739 --> 02:56.959
The FBI has him,
and he can ID me.

02:57.002 --> 02:59.527
If he knows my name, I'm done.

02:59.570 --> 03:02.138
If he knows your name and even
then, he might not do anything.

03:02.182 --> 03:03.574
He has nothing left to lose.

03:03.618 --> 03:04.793
They probably have him
holed up somewhere,

03:04.836 --> 03:06.795
negotiating a plea deal
right now.

03:06.838 --> 03:08.144
I'll take care of it.

03:08.188 --> 03:09.624
Absolutely not.

03:09.667 --> 03:11.713
You can't go anywhere near him.

03:11.756 --> 03:13.976
I'll make some calls,
I'll find out where he is,

03:14.019 --> 03:15.543
and he and I will have
a little chat.

03:15.586 --> 03:17.719
And then you and I can negotiate
our own little plea deal.

03:22.767 --> 03:25.030
Uh-oh. Is this
a family meeting?

03:25.074 --> 03:26.641
Because if it is,
I'll leave.

03:26.684 --> 03:28.208
I was just explaining
to these two

03:28.251 --> 03:30.645
that Jeff Colby is family,
and we take care of our own.

03:30.688 --> 03:32.951
Speaking of family,
I just got news on Steven.

03:32.995 --> 03:34.823
You did?Why didn't you say something?

03:34.866 --> 03:36.477
Can I talk?

03:36.520 --> 03:39.262
I spoke to the foundation head
in Paraguay.

03:39.306 --> 03:41.221
He's fine. Sort of.

03:41.264 --> 03:43.048
He, uh, disappeared
into the jungle

03:43.092 --> 03:45.573
on some sort of
ayahuasca retreat.

03:45.616 --> 03:47.052
He was on a drug binge.

03:47.096 --> 03:49.316
I think it's more
of a spiritual binge.

03:49.359 --> 03:51.492
He's still trying to figure out
who he is.

03:51.535 --> 03:53.189
You know, this all seems shady.

03:53.233 --> 03:55.060
No matter where he is, he
usually reaches out to me.

03:55.104 --> 03:57.280
I'm basically his rock.

03:57.324 --> 03:59.369
"Spiritual binge,"
that sounds like a cult.

03:59.413 --> 04:01.632
I've always said Steven
could be a cult leader.

04:01.676 --> 04:03.765
I can have an extraction team
in the jungle before nightfall.

04:03.808 --> 04:05.593
Easy, Rambo.

04:05.636 --> 04:07.769
Look, this isn't exactly
out of character for Steven.

04:07.812 --> 04:09.292
At least we know he's safe.

04:09.336 --> 04:10.772
Ish.

04:10.815 --> 04:12.774
Of course,
now he'll be MIA

04:12.817 --> 04:14.776
from the charity gala tomorrow
for his own foundation,

04:14.819 --> 04:16.734
but I can pick up the slack.

04:16.778 --> 04:20.477
I guess that's what love is,
doing things you don't want to

04:20.521 --> 04:22.871
for people who don't quite
deserve it.

04:28.572 --> 04:30.444
BLAKE:
Cristal?

04:31.271 --> 04:32.750
JENNINGS:
Yes. Here.

04:32.794 --> 04:34.404
Are you sure you don't want
to go to this meeting with me?

04:34.448 --> 04:37.668
Well, the thought
of talking finances

04:37.712 --> 04:40.932
is so exciting to me,

04:40.976 --> 04:42.543
but I'm gonna let you
have all the fun.

04:42.586 --> 04:43.848
This should be the final meeting

04:43.892 --> 04:45.197
before the soccer league
signs off on our bid.

04:45.241 --> 04:48.070
I have complete faith in you.

04:48.113 --> 04:51.334
Well, that would be
your first mistake.

04:53.118 --> 04:54.729
This is gonna be like
one long honeymoon.

04:54.772 --> 04:55.773
Mm.

04:57.427 --> 04:58.907
Hey.

04:58.950 --> 05:00.996
You okay?

05:01.039 --> 05:03.738
I'm fine.

05:03.781 --> 05:05.348
I'm just tired.

05:05.392 --> 05:07.698
I can think of something
to wake you up.

05:07.742 --> 05:09.221
Talking finance.

05:09.265 --> 05:11.920
You should get going. Go.

05:20.537 --> 05:23.497
How cute are these?

05:23.540 --> 05:26.195
Maybe we should have Steven's
face printed on some of them.

05:26.238 --> 05:28.110
I don't want him on a truffle.
I want him here.

05:28.153 --> 05:29.981
And on a truffle.

05:30.025 --> 05:31.983
He is here, in spirit.

05:32.027 --> 05:34.899
Well, spirit isn't going to help
me plan a gala.

05:34.943 --> 05:36.118
The First Annual

05:36.161 --> 05:38.076
Steven Carrington Foundation
Fund-raiser,

05:38.120 --> 05:39.948
minus Steven Carrington.

05:39.991 --> 05:42.951
If you don't want to throw this
party, I most certainly can.

05:42.994 --> 05:44.953
You most certainly can't. I've
already hired a professional.

05:44.996 --> 05:46.607
And everything,
from the silent auction

05:46.650 --> 05:49.871
to the refreshments,
is being handled.

05:49.914 --> 05:53.004
All you have to think
about is your speech.

05:53.048 --> 05:54.310
What speech?

05:54.354 --> 05:56.051
Just a few words
for the guests.

05:56.094 --> 05:59.315
As Steven's spouse,
you are officially

05:59.359 --> 06:00.621
the host of the gala.

06:00.664 --> 06:02.927
I could give a speech.
I am his mother.

06:02.971 --> 06:04.407
Don't remind me.

06:04.451 --> 06:06.322
Steven owes me so big.

06:06.366 --> 06:07.932
Well, it looks to me
like you've already

06:07.976 --> 06:09.412
rewarded yourself quite well.

06:09.456 --> 06:11.501
Speaking of shopping,

06:11.545 --> 06:14.286
why don't you and I coordinate
our wardrobe?

06:14.330 --> 06:16.854
As Steven's representatives.

06:23.948 --> 06:26.821
Welcome back to the land
of the living.

06:26.864 --> 06:28.866
DOCTOR:
Try not to move around
too much, Mr. Colby.

06:28.910 --> 06:30.172
You're likely to be sore.

06:30.215 --> 06:33.175
Which hospital is this?

06:33.218 --> 06:34.655
It's not.

06:34.698 --> 06:36.221
You're at the manor.

06:36.265 --> 06:38.963
The what?

06:39.007 --> 06:40.791
Oh, hell no.

06:40.835 --> 06:42.576
No, no, no. No, no.Shh. Jeff.

06:42.619 --> 06:44.665
N-N-No. You need
to take it easy.

06:44.708 --> 06:47.407
You were in a car accident, and
then you had a bullet removed.

06:48.799 --> 06:51.802
I can't believe you let them
bring me here.

06:51.846 --> 06:54.588
I didn't "let them" bring you
anywhere. I just found out.

06:56.198 --> 06:58.374
He's awake.

06:58.418 --> 07:00.855
Maybe you can tell us what
the hell is going on here.

07:00.898 --> 07:02.857
All of this is on you.

07:02.900 --> 07:04.902
Ada, the smoke bombs
in the club,

07:04.946 --> 07:06.208
my brother getting shot.

07:06.251 --> 07:07.514
Monica, I'm sorry,

07:07.557 --> 07:08.993
but it is much more
complicated than you...

07:09.037 --> 07:11.213
I don't believe a word
that comes out of your mouth.

07:11.256 --> 07:13.041
You may have fooled Fallon,

07:13.084 --> 07:15.696
but she's gonna figure out
who you are real quick,

07:15.739 --> 07:18.089
and I want to be there
to watch her destroy your ass.

07:18.133 --> 07:20.744
Monica, it's okay.
I'm okay, all right?

07:23.355 --> 07:24.574
Can you give me and him
a second alone?

07:30.406 --> 07:33.322
What am I doing here, man?

07:33.365 --> 07:34.845
You'd be recovering
in a jail cell

07:34.889 --> 07:35.933
if I did everything by the book.

07:35.977 --> 07:37.326
So you called Blake?

07:37.369 --> 07:40.068
That is so messed up, man.

07:40.111 --> 07:41.939
I... I-I got to get out of here.

07:41.983 --> 07:44.246
Look, look, look.
The doctor said you need to rest

07:44.289 --> 07:46.291
until you regain
your strength.

07:46.335 --> 07:48.206
Blake and Fallon
know everything,

07:48.250 --> 07:50.295
so they're cool with you staying
here as long as you need to.

07:50.339 --> 07:53.298
Come here.

07:56.388 --> 07:58.260
You almost killed my sister.

07:58.303 --> 08:00.567
And then you almost killed me.

08:02.525 --> 08:04.919
I'm gonna find a way
to make you pay for this.

08:04.962 --> 08:06.486
And it will hurt.

08:08.052 --> 08:09.314
Now get the hell
out of my sight.

08:22.545 --> 08:23.503
What is it?

08:23.546 --> 08:25.417
I-I'm here to clean?

08:25.461 --> 08:27.550
Uh, no. No, not now.

08:27.594 --> 08:29.378
That's why I put a sign
on the... on the door.

08:29.421 --> 08:30.553
Fresh towels?

08:30.597 --> 08:31.989
Uh, yeah. I guess.

08:32.033 --> 08:34.078
Just, can you make it quick,
please?Mm-hmm.

08:34.122 --> 08:36.080
Yeah. No, sir.
Not you. Sorry.

08:36.124 --> 08:37.821
Yeah. We're just
in a holding pattern

08:37.865 --> 08:40.258
until the lawyers get here.

08:40.302 --> 08:44.045
We should have something in
place by tomorrow at the latest.

08:44.088 --> 08:46.830
No. Excuse me!

08:46.874 --> 08:48.832
Hey! Can you stop that?

08:48.876 --> 08:52.140
No, no, I'm sorry.
I, I can't-- I can't hear you.

08:52.183 --> 08:54.490
No. We have a really aggressive
housekeeper here.

08:54.534 --> 08:57.537
It is-- Hold on.
Hold on a second.

08:57.580 --> 08:59.539
Oh.

09:09.418 --> 09:10.593
Hi there.

09:10.637 --> 09:12.160
Hello, Nico.

09:12.203 --> 09:13.683
Who are you?

09:15.032 --> 09:16.643
Did Ada send you?

09:16.686 --> 09:18.427
Where's-where's Darrell?

09:18.470 --> 09:19.907
Oh, he just stepped out
for a second.

09:19.950 --> 09:22.170
And, no, Ada didn't send me.

09:22.213 --> 09:23.867
Oh, okay.

09:23.911 --> 09:26.566
Well, I could use clean sheets.

09:26.609 --> 09:28.045
First of all, gross.

09:28.089 --> 09:29.438
Second of all, I don't know
the first thing

09:29.481 --> 09:30.700
about changing linens.

09:32.441 --> 09:34.486
I'm here to change your mind.

09:38.708 --> 09:41.363
How 'bout it?

10:07.650 --> 10:09.478
STEVEN:
Hey, this is Steven Carrington.

10:09.521 --> 10:11.567
Please leave a message
and I'll get back to you.

10:11.611 --> 10:14.309
Hey, it's me. Again.

10:14.352 --> 10:16.572
Can you please call me back?

10:16.616 --> 10:18.052
Actually, I'm not asking.

10:18.095 --> 10:19.793
You need to call me back,
damn it.

10:19.836 --> 10:21.533
You...

10:21.577 --> 10:23.753
You actually sent me divorce
papers in the mail, Steven?

10:23.797 --> 10:25.799
What the hell is going on?

10:25.842 --> 10:28.236
WOMAN: If you're satisfied with
your message, please hang up.

10:28.279 --> 10:30.804
No. Of course I'm not satisfied.If not, dial one for...

10:32.719 --> 10:34.808
NICO: What did you say
your name was again?

10:34.851 --> 10:36.287
I didn't.

10:36.331 --> 10:38.681
Then why would I trust you
to help me with anything?

10:38.725 --> 10:40.291
I don't even know who you are.

10:40.335 --> 10:41.902
Or why you're
doing this.

10:41.945 --> 10:43.164
I'm doing this for a friend.

10:43.207 --> 10:44.644
And it's not about who I am.

10:44.687 --> 10:46.297
It's about what
I can do for you.

10:46.341 --> 10:49.649
Anything you can do, I'm pretty
sure my lawyer can do better.

10:49.692 --> 10:51.172
Really? Because
my sources tell me

10:51.215 --> 10:53.870
that you were caught red-handed
with a truck full of heroin.

10:53.914 --> 10:55.263
Yeah.
So...

10:55.306 --> 10:56.699
you don't really have
a ton of options.Maybe not.

10:56.743 --> 10:59.006
But if I tell the
Feds what I know,

10:59.049 --> 11:02.313
I'll be a free man in three and
a half years instead of ten.

11:02.357 --> 11:04.359
And what else do you have?
I mean, the FBI

11:04.402 --> 11:05.752
doesn't knock off
seven years for nothing.

11:05.795 --> 11:09.146
Just the guy that
sold me the drugs.

11:09.190 --> 11:10.321
Michael Culhane.

11:11.540 --> 11:13.368
Well, the money is
just a down payment.

11:13.411 --> 11:14.804
It's a sign of good faith.

11:14.848 --> 11:16.850
This... is
a one-time-only offer.

11:16.893 --> 11:20.854
Shiny new passport,
one-way ticket to the Bahamas,

11:20.897 --> 11:23.030
the deed to a bungalow
on the beach,

11:23.073 --> 11:24.684
and $10 million in cash.

11:24.727 --> 11:27.730
All you need to do is never say
the name Michael Culhane again.

11:29.036 --> 11:30.690
Tempting.

11:30.733 --> 11:33.083
But you can't call off the FBI.

11:33.127 --> 11:35.477
So, even if I took
your offer...

11:35.520 --> 11:38.132
I'd be a fugitive.

11:38.175 --> 11:40.961
And I like Texas barbecue too
much to be on the run forever.

11:41.004 --> 11:42.919
Then you and I
will pick an island

11:42.963 --> 11:44.268
where extradition is impossible,

11:44.312 --> 11:46.401
and we'll fly in a few slabs
from Franklin's

11:46.444 --> 11:48.620
every weekend.

11:48.664 --> 11:50.884
Sorry. No deal.

11:50.927 --> 11:52.712
Now, unless
you're gonna

11:52.755 --> 11:56.280
actually change my linens,
you should leave,

11:56.324 --> 11:58.979
before I tell my FBI
friend what's going on.

12:00.284 --> 12:02.547
I guess you saving my life
was as tough for you

12:02.591 --> 12:04.419
as it was for me, so...

12:04.462 --> 12:06.160
thanks for that.

12:06.203 --> 12:08.162
You should be thanking me
for bringing you here.

12:08.205 --> 12:09.903
We both know how much
you hate hospitals

12:09.946 --> 12:11.992
since you had your
tonsils taken out.

12:12.035 --> 12:15.517
Although that was probably more
about your mother abandoning you

12:15.560 --> 12:17.649
than losing your tonsils.
I remember you, uh,

12:17.693 --> 12:20.565
didn't talk for two months
after that surgery.

12:20.609 --> 12:22.959
I had a sore throat.

12:23.960 --> 12:26.571
And a lot on my mind, okay?

12:26.615 --> 12:28.617
But that's your sister.

12:28.660 --> 12:31.751
Always leaving damage behind
as she disappears.

12:33.187 --> 12:34.797
Half sister.

12:35.842 --> 12:38.235
Which... brings me
to my point.

12:39.541 --> 12:43.197
For better or worse,
we're a family, Jeff.

12:43.240 --> 12:44.676
Family helps each other.

12:46.504 --> 12:47.810
I just need a small favor,

12:47.854 --> 12:49.551
and it's one
that'll benefit both of us.

12:49.594 --> 12:51.074
And to be fair,

12:51.118 --> 12:52.293
you owe me.

12:52.336 --> 12:53.729
I need

12:53.773 --> 12:56.123
a diverse investment partner
to get this soccer team.

12:56.166 --> 12:59.082
All it'll cost you is
$10 million for 20% ownership,

12:59.126 --> 13:01.389
and a phone call
to the Urban Outreach Coalition

13:01.432 --> 13:03.086
pushing our bid.

13:03.130 --> 13:05.523
Then all you have to do
is cash checks and enjoy
your luxury box.

13:05.567 --> 13:06.829
It sounds like
a win-win to me.

13:06.873 --> 13:09.179
No. It sounds like
you're getting $10 million,

13:09.223 --> 13:11.573
and all I'm getting
is tickets to a team

13:11.616 --> 13:13.923
that likely won't win a game
for two years.

13:13.967 --> 13:15.577
You're also getting an uncle

13:15.620 --> 13:17.492
that's willing
to keep your secrets.

13:18.841 --> 13:20.060
You're really
gonna blackmail

13:20.103 --> 13:21.757
a man in a
wheelchair?
Yeah.

13:21.801 --> 13:23.977
You have reached
an all-time low, Blake.

13:24.020 --> 13:25.108
What do you want, Jeff?

13:25.152 --> 13:26.675
I'm trying to make a deal here.

13:26.718 --> 13:27.937
Then let's make one.

13:27.981 --> 13:29.417
I'm listening.

13:29.460 --> 13:31.506
I want Culhane crushed.

13:31.549 --> 13:33.551
He's my future son-in-law.

13:33.595 --> 13:35.031
Which means he's not blood.

13:36.554 --> 13:38.469
You want your soccer team.

13:38.513 --> 13:40.515
I want Culhane to suffer.

13:49.306 --> 13:51.308
Hi. I know you told me

13:51.352 --> 13:54.094
you never wanted to talk
to me again, but...

13:54.137 --> 13:55.443
we need your help.

13:55.486 --> 13:56.879
"We"?

13:56.923 --> 13:58.881
Yeah.

13:58.925 --> 14:00.404
We.

14:06.933 --> 14:10.632
And then the FBI almost busted
Culhane for delivering drugs

14:10.675 --> 14:12.373
to one of Max's
old VKI connects.

14:12.416 --> 14:15.245
Yeah, but you have
no actual evidence that
Uncle Max was involved.

14:15.289 --> 14:17.944
Well, that's why we need
your help, to access the files.

14:17.987 --> 14:20.424
We need to find the paper trail
that leads back to Max.

14:20.468 --> 14:22.122
Even if I had it...

14:22.165 --> 14:25.429
I told you to never
call me again, Fallon.

14:25.473 --> 14:26.996
And it's sort of
a big ask.

14:27.040 --> 14:30.043
You know, me turning on
my favorite uncle, who is dead,

14:30.086 --> 14:32.567
to help my...
sort of ex-wife

14:32.610 --> 14:34.917
and... her new fiancé.

14:34.961 --> 14:36.788
And this would ruin his name.

14:36.832 --> 14:38.094
My name.

14:39.139 --> 14:40.923
Tell him.

14:43.317 --> 14:45.580
When we were in New York...

14:45.623 --> 14:48.975
Max wouldn't sign
for your family to buy C.A.

14:49.018 --> 14:50.933
from my family...

14:50.977 --> 14:52.979
unless I had sex with him.

14:56.983 --> 14:58.462
Wait, wait, wait. What?

14:58.506 --> 14:59.681
I'm sorry.

14:59.724 --> 15:00.943
I should have told you.

15:00.987 --> 15:02.858
I was afraid
it would blow up the deal.

15:02.902 --> 15:04.207
So you...

15:04.251 --> 15:05.426
Did you?

15:05.469 --> 15:06.557
No.

15:06.601 --> 15:08.342
I did what any
normal person would do.

15:08.385 --> 15:10.518
I blindfolded him
and hired a look-alike escort

15:10.561 --> 15:11.954
to pinch-hit for me.

15:11.998 --> 15:14.087
But then her...

15:14.130 --> 15:16.263
expertise...

15:16.306 --> 15:18.091
caused him
to have a heart attack.

15:18.134 --> 15:21.181
MICHAEL:
And in the process
of cleaning allthat up,

15:21.224 --> 15:23.400
I got tied up with Ada.

15:23.444 --> 15:25.185
I'm sorry.

15:25.228 --> 15:28.405
I hate asking you for anything,
especially right now, but...

15:28.449 --> 15:29.711
please.

15:37.632 --> 15:39.286
Mmm.

15:39.329 --> 15:41.592
Sorry,

15:41.636 --> 15:43.203
no animals in the kitchen.

15:43.246 --> 15:45.509
Even if the rest
of your "paint and sip" class

15:45.553 --> 15:46.728
loved yours the best.

15:46.771 --> 15:48.817
Since you have
effectively blackballed me

15:48.860 --> 15:52.473
from helping with this party,
I am contributing in my own way.

15:52.516 --> 15:54.997
And I'm gonna put up
my latest painting,

15:55.041 --> 15:57.957
anonymously, at the
gala's silent auction.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.002
You're joking.
Or inebriated.

16:00.046 --> 16:03.658
I will have you know that
my work has been shown andsold

16:03.701 --> 16:06.008
all over metro Atlanta.

16:06.052 --> 16:08.489
Oh. In which coffee shops?

16:08.532 --> 16:10.143
Well, I'm just trying to help.

16:10.186 --> 16:12.449
Yes, well, it's because
of all your "help" lately

16:12.493 --> 16:14.756
that Steven's not here
to host his own party.

16:14.799 --> 16:17.541
Ah, that's what this is about.

16:17.585 --> 16:19.326
Look, Joseph,

16:19.369 --> 16:21.458
Steven's always been
a leaf in the wind.

16:21.502 --> 16:23.025
And I love that about him.

16:23.069 --> 16:24.853
There's a difference
between being free-spirited

16:24.896 --> 16:26.159
and irresponsible.

16:26.202 --> 16:27.769
I should just thank God

16:27.812 --> 16:30.032
that you're past the age
of bearing children.

16:30.076 --> 16:32.730
Now the only thing you
can ruin is blank canvases.

16:34.167 --> 16:36.038
That's good work.

16:36.082 --> 16:39.172
The divorce
seems real on paper,

16:39.215 --> 16:41.696
but Steven's
never this impulsive.

16:41.739 --> 16:43.567
Is it possible
that he's been unhappy

16:43.611 --> 16:45.047
and just... didn't say it?

16:45.091 --> 16:47.702
He's married to me.
Why would he be unhappy?

16:47.745 --> 16:48.877
It had to be

16:48.920 --> 16:50.879
the ayahuasca talking.

16:50.922 --> 16:53.055
I should just ignore
the whole thing, right?

16:54.622 --> 16:56.624
I came to you for advice.

16:56.667 --> 16:59.061
Don't clam up now.

16:59.105 --> 17:00.367
Okay.

17:00.410 --> 17:03.761
From what I know about
ayahuasca ceremonies,

17:03.805 --> 17:06.329
they work as some
sort of truth serum.

17:06.373 --> 17:08.201
They're supposed
to reveal your...

17:08.244 --> 17:09.550
inner demons...

17:09.593 --> 17:11.117
your feelings.

17:11.160 --> 17:14.207
So you're saying
deep down this is what
Steven really wants?

17:15.382 --> 17:16.731
Well, that'scruel.

17:16.774 --> 17:19.386
I'm just saying there's
no way that you can be

17:19.429 --> 17:22.389
a hundred percent sure what's
going on in someone else's mind.

17:22.432 --> 17:24.217
And Steven's been
through so much trauma

17:24.260 --> 17:25.566
in the past few months.

17:25.609 --> 17:29.004
Maybe... he wants
a fresh start.

17:29.048 --> 17:31.050
You were supposed
to give me a pep talk,

17:31.093 --> 17:32.573
not make me more depressed.

17:32.616 --> 17:33.922
I'm sorry. Maybe I'm wrong.

17:33.965 --> 17:35.967
I'm just trying to
see both sides here.

17:36.011 --> 17:37.621
Let's just talk
about something else.

17:40.189 --> 17:41.538
Okay.

17:42.539 --> 17:44.933
I'm pregnant.

17:46.543 --> 17:48.067
I just found out.

17:48.110 --> 17:49.720
I haven't told Blake.

17:49.764 --> 17:52.419
The timing's terrible,
and it makes me look
like a gold digger.

17:52.462 --> 17:53.942
Okay.

17:53.985 --> 17:56.075
So was not expecting that...

17:56.118 --> 17:57.728
you are expecting.

17:59.252 --> 18:00.340
Are you gonna keep it?

18:00.383 --> 18:01.689
I want to.

18:01.732 --> 18:03.038
But with Adam running off,

18:03.082 --> 18:04.779
Steven gone,
and the baby being kidnapped,

18:04.822 --> 18:08.174
I just don't think Blake is in
a good place for this right now.

18:08.217 --> 18:10.611
And how do you know what he
wants if you haven't asked him?

18:10.654 --> 18:11.742
I know.

18:12.656 --> 18:13.831
I think.

18:13.875 --> 18:14.963
You need to tell him.

18:15.006 --> 18:16.573
Or...

18:16.617 --> 18:19.098
give him some ayahuasca,
see what he reallythinks.

18:24.015 --> 18:27.149
LIAM:
You're really going to the
ends of the earth here.

18:27.193 --> 18:29.325
Are you sure this
is all worth it?

18:29.369 --> 18:32.154
Are you sure you're okay
with all this coming out
about Uncle Max?

18:32.198 --> 18:34.069
If he did what you
said he did, then...

18:34.113 --> 18:35.201
yeah.

18:35.244 --> 18:36.941
Uncle Max deserves this.

18:36.985 --> 18:38.117
So you believe me.

18:38.160 --> 18:39.944
I do.

18:41.555 --> 18:44.645
I know you think
I made the wrong decision...

18:44.688 --> 18:46.821
about who to be with.

18:47.865 --> 18:50.041
You said it, not me.

18:54.698 --> 18:57.658
Well, your uncle did a pretty
good job at covering his tracks.

18:57.701 --> 18:59.312
Yeah. Looks like

18:59.355 --> 19:02.141
all the shipping invoices have
been professionally doctored.

19:02.184 --> 19:03.533
I don't think

19:03.577 --> 19:05.405
we're gonna find
a smoking gun here, Fallon.

19:05.448 --> 19:08.190
Well, maybe we do
some doctoring of our own.

19:17.982 --> 19:19.636
How you feeling?

19:19.680 --> 19:21.334
Man, spare me your concern.
What do you want?

19:21.377 --> 19:23.771
Well, to clear the air
about a few things.

19:23.814 --> 19:25.033
Such as?

19:25.076 --> 19:26.687
Where we stand.

19:26.730 --> 19:29.342
I spoke to Fallon,
told her everything.

19:29.385 --> 19:30.734
She forgave me.

19:30.778 --> 19:33.476
That's great.
You didn't get her shot.

19:33.520 --> 19:35.522
That's fair enough.

19:35.565 --> 19:37.219
But it goes without saying,

19:37.263 --> 19:39.961
we need to keep quiet
about all things Ada-related,

19:40.004 --> 19:41.615
for both our sakes.

19:41.658 --> 19:44.008
Especially if it comes up with
your cousin, the police chief.

19:44.052 --> 19:46.228
Seriously?

19:46.272 --> 19:47.664
You think you can come in here

19:47.708 --> 19:50.493
and tell me what
I'm allowed to talk about

19:50.537 --> 19:52.843
or who I can even talk to?Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa, whoa. Calm down.

19:52.887 --> 19:53.888
You need to go, man.Jeff...

19:53.931 --> 19:55.019
Get the hell out of here!

19:55.063 --> 19:56.282
Don't touch me! All right?Sir! Sir!

19:56.325 --> 19:58.240
Don't...Sir, calm
down, sir.

19:58.284 --> 20:00.242
Jeff!

20:00.286 --> 20:02.853
WOMAN:
His BP's crashing.
Get the code cart now.

20:02.897 --> 20:05.073
Initiate resuscitation.

20:19.479 --> 20:22.133
SMOKEY ROBINSON:
♪ I don't like you

20:22.177 --> 20:25.136
♪ But I love you

20:25.180 --> 20:28.705
♪ Seems that I'm always

20:28.749 --> 20:31.099
♪ Thinking of you

20:31.142 --> 20:33.014
♪ Though, oh, oh

20:33.057 --> 20:36.104
♪ You treat me badly

20:36.147 --> 20:38.324
♪ I love you madly

20:38.367 --> 20:41.370
♪ You really got a hold on me

20:41.414 --> 20:43.590
♪ You really got a...♪

20:43.633 --> 20:45.809
Mom.

20:45.853 --> 20:48.159
WOMAN:
We got him. He's back.

20:58.257 --> 21:00.520
I didn't order turndown service.

21:03.653 --> 21:05.612
What did you do with my guard?

21:05.655 --> 21:07.440
His girlfriend just found out
about his wife.

21:07.483 --> 21:08.571
He'll be a minute.

21:08.615 --> 21:10.312
Now, step aside.

21:10.356 --> 21:12.967
I have some new information
to share.

21:15.404 --> 21:18.189
This is a paper trail

21:18.233 --> 21:20.409
proving that Max Van Kirk
was the mastermind

21:20.453 --> 21:22.019
behind VKI's drug ring.

21:22.063 --> 21:24.021
And this is
the same paper trail,

21:24.065 --> 21:25.936
except it all leads
back to you.

21:25.980 --> 21:27.547
It's fake.

21:27.590 --> 21:29.113
You made it all up.Correct.

21:29.157 --> 21:31.681
You know it's fake,
and I know it's fake.

21:31.725 --> 21:34.118
But with an airtight
online footprint backing it up,

21:34.162 --> 21:35.381
the FBI won't.

21:35.424 --> 21:38.471
So you can keep Culhane's name
out of your mouth

21:38.514 --> 21:40.560
and be home
in 42 months,

21:40.603 --> 21:43.258
or you can have
a very pissed off cellmate

21:43.302 --> 21:44.346
for 20 years.

21:44.390 --> 21:45.565
And no barbecue either.

21:47.741 --> 21:49.177
I'll make sure your lawyers
have the papers

21:49.220 --> 21:51.440
first thing in the morning.

21:54.008 --> 21:56.489
With all you're going through
to save his ass,

21:56.532 --> 21:58.969
I hope this Culhane guy's
worth it.

22:02.756 --> 22:04.018
I can't believe
they cleared you to leave

22:04.061 --> 22:05.802
after you just flatlined.

22:05.846 --> 22:08.675
Well, I didn't just
wake up and walk out.

22:08.718 --> 22:10.372
But once I set up
my own doctors,

22:10.416 --> 22:12.026
they couldn't stop me.

22:12.069 --> 22:14.158
By the way, I told
Dad you had the flu

22:14.202 --> 22:15.377
when he asked
where you'd been,

22:15.421 --> 22:17.248
not that you got shot.

22:17.292 --> 22:19.425
And from now on,
you stay put.

22:19.468 --> 22:20.904
I can't afford
to lose you.

22:20.948 --> 22:22.558
I'm fine, Mon.

22:22.602 --> 22:24.255
More than fine, really.

22:24.299 --> 22:25.518
I'm renewed.

22:25.561 --> 22:27.650
Almost reborn.

22:28.869 --> 22:30.479
Hey.

22:30.523 --> 22:33.177
What was that song Mom used to
sing to us when we were kids?

22:33.221 --> 22:34.222
What are you talking about?

22:34.265 --> 22:35.223
Saturday morning,

22:35.266 --> 22:36.224
when she was cleaning the house,

22:36.267 --> 22:38.226
there was some song she'd sing.

22:38.269 --> 22:39.880
Just calmed everything.

22:39.923 --> 22:41.403
You must be blacking out again,

22:41.447 --> 22:42.970
because that's not
how I remember it.

22:43.013 --> 22:44.058
You're jaded.

22:44.101 --> 22:45.973
And you are literally
on drugs.

22:46.016 --> 22:48.976
Mom didn't sing
nearly as much as she yelled.

22:49.019 --> 22:51.326
The only memory of her I
haven't purposely wiped out

22:51.370 --> 22:53.502
is the one where she left
me on Granny's doorstep

22:53.546 --> 22:55.069
while you were still
in the hospital

22:55.112 --> 22:56.070
and disappeared.

22:56.113 --> 22:57.332
That's the point.

22:57.376 --> 22:59.203
I never got a chance
to say goodbye to her.

22:59.247 --> 23:00.901
And that's my fault.

23:00.944 --> 23:01.902
Are you insane?

23:01.945 --> 23:03.251
She's toxic.

23:03.294 --> 23:04.644
That's why she's
not in our lives.

23:04.687 --> 23:06.602
Maybe it doesn't have
to be that way.

23:06.646 --> 23:09.605
I mean, one near-death
experience and you realize...

23:09.649 --> 23:11.781
you have to make some
changes in your life.

23:11.825 --> 23:13.957
Do those changes
include forgiving Culhane?

23:14.001 --> 23:15.263
Yeah, that's not happening.

23:15.306 --> 23:17.918
According to Fallon,
he didn't have a choice.

23:17.961 --> 23:20.268
Ada was always holding
the blackmail over him.

23:20.311 --> 23:22.488
That's not how I remember it.

23:31.410 --> 23:32.585
BLAKE:
My God.

23:32.628 --> 23:33.977
You look amazing.

23:34.978 --> 23:36.458
Are you okay?

23:36.502 --> 23:38.242
I heard Jeff left
because you asked him

23:38.286 --> 23:39.679
to be co-owner
of the team.

23:39.722 --> 23:41.681
Well, I'm not sure if
that's why he's gone.

23:41.724 --> 23:43.465
But... what's
that got to...

23:43.509 --> 23:45.032
Did you ask him?

23:45.075 --> 23:47.382
I'm trying to come up with a way
to get this team for you.

23:47.426 --> 23:49.471
Well, clearly,

23:49.515 --> 23:51.299
this isn't about me anymore.

23:51.342 --> 23:53.475
It's about you and your ego.

23:53.519 --> 23:55.738
I am not not going
to apologize

23:55.782 --> 23:58.001
for trying to build
a legacy with you.

23:58.045 --> 24:00.874
I don't understand why you're
not more excited about this.

24:00.917 --> 24:02.310
This is the first thing
I've been passionate about

24:02.353 --> 24:03.311
since C.A. dissolved.

24:03.354 --> 24:04.486
The first thing?

24:04.530 --> 24:06.009
Good to know. Okay.You...

24:06.053 --> 24:07.881
That's not what I mean.

24:07.924 --> 24:10.971
Either way, I don't need
an engagement gift.

24:11.014 --> 24:12.799
If anything,

24:12.842 --> 24:14.757
why not put that money into
Steven's charity instead?

24:15.802 --> 24:17.934
Boy's whole life was a charity.

24:17.978 --> 24:20.328
What you don't know about my
son is, he's cost me millions

24:20.371 --> 24:21.764
in his protests,
in his bail,

24:21.808 --> 24:23.200
in his countless
stints in rehab.

24:23.244 --> 24:26.290
And then he skips out on
Christmas to go on a bender?

24:26.334 --> 24:28.423
So, no,

24:28.467 --> 24:29.424
I think I'll pass on that.

24:33.123 --> 24:34.516
Hello.

24:34.560 --> 24:36.126
Just tell me when it's done.

24:41.741 --> 24:43.046
WOMAN:
Good evening.

24:43.090 --> 24:45.832

Yes.

25:04.720 --> 25:06.200
Did you talk to Blake?

25:06.243 --> 25:07.941
No. I was right.

25:07.984 --> 25:09.420
It's not the right time.

25:09.464 --> 25:10.987
It's the last thing
he needs to hear.

25:11.031 --> 25:12.380
What do you mean?

25:14.513 --> 25:15.905
Hey.

25:18.081 --> 25:19.692
Mr. Carrington-Jones.

25:19.735 --> 25:21.650
Or is it Jones-Carrington?

25:21.694 --> 25:22.912
Come here.Colin.

25:22.956 --> 25:24.566
Mm.

25:24.610 --> 25:26.176
Looks like marriage is
treating someone well.

25:26.220 --> 25:29.397
All except the part
about my husband being MIA

25:29.440 --> 25:31.399
in some South American jungle.

25:32.487 --> 25:33.575
How's your better half?

25:33.619 --> 25:35.534
Chad and I broke up.

25:35.577 --> 25:36.447
What?

25:36.491 --> 25:37.405
Yeah.

25:37.448 --> 25:39.059
You guys were perfect together.

25:39.102 --> 25:40.887
Tell that to my tear ducts,
'cause, uh,

25:40.930 --> 25:42.845
it's been brutal.

25:42.889 --> 25:46.109
You know, the worst part is
coming to these events solo.

25:46.153 --> 25:48.459
Sucks not having
your plus-one in life.

25:48.503 --> 25:50.549
I will drink to that.

25:50.592 --> 25:52.072
Bartender.Gentlemen.

25:52.115 --> 25:54.248
Two shots of something
easy on the environment

25:54.291 --> 25:56.598
and hard on the liver.Coming right up.

25:58.469 --> 26:00.167
Shouldn't you
be resting?

26:00.210 --> 26:01.734
You're gonna give yourself
another episode,

26:01.777 --> 26:03.474
running around town like this.

26:03.518 --> 26:04.650
Oh, please.

26:04.693 --> 26:06.695
Don't act like you really care.

26:06.739 --> 26:07.827
By the way,

26:07.870 --> 26:09.437
forget about Culhane.

26:09.480 --> 26:11.265
I'll take care of him myself.

26:11.308 --> 26:13.223
Oh, don't tell me you suddenly
developed a conscience

26:13.267 --> 26:14.660
after your kiss with death.

26:14.703 --> 26:15.922
It's already
in motion.

26:15.965 --> 26:17.793
We have a deal.
I kept up my end.

26:17.837 --> 26:19.012
Now you have to keep up yours.

26:19.055 --> 26:21.623
I do have some thoughts
on the team.

26:21.667 --> 26:22.624
Cool your jets there, pal.

26:22.668 --> 26:23.973
You're a silent partner.

26:24.017 --> 26:25.671
You call Urban Outreach,
put up the money.

26:25.714 --> 26:26.672
That's it.

26:26.715 --> 26:28.630
No, that's not it.

26:29.675 --> 26:30.632
Excuse me?

26:30.676 --> 26:32.286
Once the bid has been finalized,

26:32.329 --> 26:34.767
Blake Carrington
and the new Atlanta soccer team

26:34.810 --> 26:36.464
are gonna fix up
the neighborhood

26:36.507 --> 26:37.770
where the stadium is going,

26:37.813 --> 26:40.076
giving people jobs.
And...

26:40.120 --> 26:41.730
you're also gonna be
a proud sponsor

26:41.774 --> 26:43.297
of the new Colby Music Academy,

26:43.340 --> 26:44.646
right in the heart
of the community.

26:44.690 --> 26:45.995
Or else?

26:46.039 --> 26:48.128
Or else no Urban Outreach call,

26:48.171 --> 26:49.738
no $10 million,

26:49.782 --> 26:52.523
and maybe I'll call my cousin,
the police chief,

26:52.567 --> 26:54.830
and ask some questions
about aiding and abetting.

26:54.874 --> 26:56.615
Hmm.

27:03.709 --> 27:06.799
Anything for the community.

27:18.027 --> 27:20.160
Why don't you come
into the study?

27:20.203 --> 27:22.162
I've got
some champagne chilling,

27:22.205 --> 27:24.120
and I hate to drink alone.

27:24.164 --> 27:26.383
I'm not in a champagne mood.

27:26.427 --> 27:29.691
Well, then...

27:29.735 --> 27:33.521
we'll just have to get you
in one, won't we?

27:35.218 --> 27:37.481
Blake, we need to talk.

27:37.525 --> 27:39.266
I'm trying to end our argument,
not start a new one.

27:42.661 --> 27:43.836
Cristal?

27:46.490 --> 27:47.927
Are you okay?

27:47.970 --> 27:49.842
I'm okay.

27:57.806 --> 27:59.634
Blake, I can explain.

28:00.635 --> 28:01.636
Just...

28:15.302 --> 28:17.130
Hello? Anyone home?

28:17.173 --> 28:18.348
Hi, everyone.

28:18.392 --> 28:19.610
I'm Sam.

28:19.654 --> 28:20.916
Steven's husband.

28:20.960 --> 28:22.613
Steven's in Paraguay.

28:22.657 --> 28:25.312
But, uh, most of you
already know that, so...

28:25.355 --> 28:28.184
Well, I wanted
to thank you guys

28:28.228 --> 28:30.796
for coming out and supporting
Steven's foundation.

28:30.839 --> 28:32.362
Now, I'm...

28:32.406 --> 28:34.713
still not sure
what it does, but...

28:34.756 --> 28:36.802
I know it's for a good cause.

28:38.194 --> 28:39.718
Anyhoo,

28:39.761 --> 28:41.720
Steven loves this charity.

28:41.763 --> 28:43.504
In fact, he, uh--

28:43.547 --> 28:44.940
oh, he loves it so much

28:44.984 --> 28:48.204
that he didn't come home
for Christmas.

28:49.510 --> 28:51.120
Now, that's dedication.

28:52.165 --> 28:53.296
Hi, Fallon.

28:53.340 --> 28:55.124
Now, I see

28:55.168 --> 28:57.518
that we are at, uh, 90%

28:57.561 --> 28:58.954
of our goal.

28:58.998 --> 29:01.522
And I know that Steven
would want me

29:01.565 --> 29:04.525
to donate
the final million dollars

29:04.568 --> 29:06.919
of his own personal money

29:06.962 --> 29:09.182
to reach 100%.

29:09.225 --> 29:10.966
So, consider it done.

29:11.010 --> 29:12.228
Fill 'er up!

29:23.979 --> 29:25.589
Excuse me,
everyone.

29:25.633 --> 29:27.200
I know that this
is not my party,

29:27.243 --> 29:28.810
and you are all having
eco-friendly fun,

29:28.854 --> 29:29.811
so I'll make this quick.

29:29.855 --> 29:31.595
Some of you
probably remember

29:31.639 --> 29:32.901
the last time I was up here,

29:32.945 --> 29:34.381
to announce that

29:34.424 --> 29:35.730
I was taking some time
for myself.

29:35.774 --> 29:37.688
MAN: Blake Time!Exactly.

29:37.732 --> 29:39.342
And I am not gonna lie to you.

29:39.386 --> 29:41.823
Blake Time was a good time.

29:43.216 --> 29:44.521
But...

29:44.565 --> 29:46.828
all good things
must come to an end,

29:46.872 --> 29:48.830
to make room for better things.

29:48.874 --> 29:51.702
Indeed, you may have heard that
I have found a new passion.

29:51.746 --> 29:54.009
I am the owner

29:54.053 --> 29:56.620
of Atlanta's newest
professional soccer team.

29:58.492 --> 30:00.711
But that is not the
most exciting thing

30:00.755 --> 30:02.365
on the horizon.

30:02.409 --> 30:04.150
I'm expanding.

30:04.193 --> 30:05.934
Because my fiancée
Cristal and I

30:05.978 --> 30:08.545
are expecting a new baby.

30:10.852 --> 30:12.332
A new what?

30:12.375 --> 30:14.160
I think he said a new baby.

30:14.203 --> 30:15.726
BLAKE:
So I would like to propose

30:15.770 --> 30:17.032
a toast

30:17.076 --> 30:18.077
to me time

30:18.120 --> 30:20.035
becoming we time...

30:21.515 --> 30:22.995
...becoming three time.

30:24.518 --> 30:25.562
Stay green, people.

30:32.918 --> 30:36.095
This is going to be
an amazing adventure.

30:43.929 --> 30:45.539
Hey.

30:45.582 --> 30:47.062
I've been looking for you.

30:47.106 --> 30:48.324
For someone who almost died,

30:48.368 --> 30:50.370
you really are up and about.

30:50.413 --> 30:51.675
Well, I didn't almost die.

30:51.719 --> 30:52.851
I was dead.

30:52.894 --> 30:54.069
Which is why I'm still
at half-speed.

30:54.113 --> 30:55.418
But I'd like to think

30:55.462 --> 30:56.898
that's better than most
people's full-speed.

30:58.030 --> 30:59.422
Hey, have you seen Culhane?

30:59.466 --> 31:00.989
No.

31:01.033 --> 31:03.905
But, um, I want
to talk to you about that.

31:03.949 --> 31:05.951
Look, I care
about you, Fallon.

31:05.994 --> 31:07.517
And if you're really gonna
marry this dude,

31:07.561 --> 31:09.302
I need to make sure he told you
everything that went down.

31:09.345 --> 31:11.913
Hey, I'm not happy
about what happened,

31:11.957 --> 31:13.219
but he explained it to me.

31:13.262 --> 31:14.611
And it sounded like he did
what he had to do.

31:14.655 --> 31:16.787
So he told you
that he kept working for Ada

31:16.831 --> 31:18.267
even after he got
the blackmail back?

31:18.311 --> 31:20.052
That he chose to stay?

31:20.095 --> 31:22.228
Excuse me?I'm just trying
to look out for you.

31:22.271 --> 31:24.491
Maybe you need
to talk to your fiancé.

31:30.714 --> 31:33.456
What are you hiding out
from down here?

31:33.500 --> 31:35.458
Take your pick.

31:35.502 --> 31:37.025
You were right.

31:37.069 --> 31:38.374
Well, you're gonna have to be
more specific.

31:38.418 --> 31:39.723
I'm right about
a lot of things.

31:39.767 --> 31:42.378
Culhane lied to me. Again.

31:42.422 --> 31:44.598
And now I can forgive him

31:44.641 --> 31:46.948
and save him by putting
my own life in jeopardy,

31:46.992 --> 31:49.559
or I can do nothing

31:49.603 --> 31:52.084
and let him pay for
what he did with Ada.

31:53.433 --> 31:54.956
I'm just not sure
which fate he deserves.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.653
You know exactly what
he deserves.

31:56.697 --> 31:58.917
You just don't want to be
the one to decide it.

32:01.571 --> 32:03.834
MAN: I told you.
Amazing, right? I mean,

32:03.878 --> 32:05.314
just look at the coloring.

32:05.358 --> 32:07.447
It's unbelievable.WOMAN: Stunning.

32:07.490 --> 32:09.797
And the colors really
do pop, don't they?

32:09.840 --> 32:12.974
Oh, well, I wasn't talking
about the actual painting.

32:13.018 --> 32:14.671
It's just this dog,

32:14.715 --> 32:17.631
it looks just like the one
we got our grandchildren.

32:17.674 --> 32:20.112
Oh, then you should bid on it.
I mean, I would,

32:20.155 --> 32:22.853
but I already have
so many pieces by this artist.

32:22.897 --> 32:25.465
MAN:
Well, you know,

32:25.508 --> 32:27.336
maybe if our grandkids did it.

32:27.380 --> 32:30.992
But we're not really into
artwork that's done by children.

32:33.386 --> 32:36.432
You know, it's an interesting
choice of colors.

No. Nothing.

34:45.866 --> 34:47.389
Well, if you do
get to talk to him,

34:47.433 --> 34:48.999
just tell him that I...

34:50.523 --> 34:53.221
...just tell him
that I hope he's doing okay.

35:04.014 --> 35:06.060
I don't understand why you
were afraid to tell me.

With all that's been going on
with your other children...

35:12.153 --> 35:13.328
...I was worried
it wasn't a good time

35:13.372 --> 35:14.503
to talk about a new one.

35:14.547 --> 35:16.505
And now with the soccer team

35:16.549 --> 35:19.726
and all these travel plans...

35:22.337 --> 35:24.600
I don't know
if you're aware of this,

35:24.644 --> 35:27.473
but I happen to be
a billionaire.

35:27.516 --> 35:30.824
Which means wherever we go,
we can take our baby with us.

35:30.867 --> 35:33.174
Are you sure?

35:33.218 --> 35:35.133
Yeah.

35:35.176 --> 35:37.178
I wasn't a very good father
the first time around.

35:37.222 --> 35:40.616
I was busy with work
and trying to prove myself to...

35:40.660 --> 35:42.488
well, everyone.

35:42.531 --> 35:44.185
This is a chance

35:44.229 --> 35:47.014

the right way.

You know what, never mind.

36:42.896 --> 36:44.637
I'm just relieved.

36:44.680 --> 36:47.466
Y-You're sure?Yes.

36:47.509 --> 36:50.425

doesn't include Michael Culhane.

36:56.301 --> 36:59.913
Okay. I know
this has been rough,

36:59.956 --> 37:02.132
but I'm glad
you finally realized the truth.

37:02.176 --> 37:05.614
Nothing like this
will ever happen again.

37:05.658 --> 37:08.400
I know it won't.

37:08.443 --> 37:10.880
Because this is over.

37:12.317 --> 37:14.580
The wedding is off.

37:14.623 --> 37:17.235
You lied to me, Michael.

37:17.278 --> 37:19.237
I know you kept working for Ada.

37:19.280 --> 37:21.761
And I know you kept
misleading me.

37:21.804 --> 37:23.763
And I might be able to
forgive you someday,

37:23.806 --> 37:26.592
but I'll never be able
to trust you again.

37:28.289 --> 37:30.248
I just won't.

actually.

with Culhane, did you?

38:16.381 --> 38:19.340
Not exactly.

38:19.384 --> 38:23.649

and I'm gonna let it go.
