00:36.514 --> 00:37.472
- Ew, gross.

00:39.691 --> 00:41.519
You can go right here.

00:44.392 --> 00:47.612
I'm gonna show you
guys, are you ready?

00:54.184 --> 00:55.055
Take that.

01:02.671 --> 01:03.498
Hopeless.

01:05.717 --> 01:06.805
Not even one.

01:08.807 --> 01:10.505
Today is not my day.

01:17.686 --> 01:20.819
Teresa and Tim.

01:32.396 --> 01:33.615
Yoohoo!

01:35.095 --> 01:35.878
Here we are.

01:35.921 --> 01:37.880
We're here!

01:37.923 --> 01:39.664
Hold on to your ride.

01:42.189 --> 01:44.321
Follow me.

01:45.844 --> 01:48.673
No time to hang around.

01:48.717 --> 01:50.545
Wow!

01:50.588 --> 01:53.504
Time
to get to work.

01:57.117 --> 01:59.162
♪ Oh here we go

01:59.206 --> 02:02.426
♪ We got so much
work to do to go

02:02.470 --> 02:03.427
♪ La la la la la

02:03.471 --> 02:04.776
♪ La la la

02:08.389 --> 02:09.433
- Tim, don't flop.

02:09.477 --> 02:11.783
Why did you stop?

02:11.827 --> 02:13.089
- I wanna have fun Todd.

02:13.133 --> 02:14.264
- No, the other
elves are waiting.

02:14.308 --> 02:15.178
This is so frustrating.

02:16.919 --> 02:17.876
Why did we wait?

02:17.920 --> 02:19.051
Keep on moving.

02:19.095 --> 02:20.705
We don't have all day.

02:31.107 --> 02:32.064
Check it out.
- Cut it down.

02:32.108 --> 02:34.284
Your behaving like a clown.

02:49.647 --> 02:50.866
- Wow!

02:50.909 --> 02:54.478
- With a one and
a two and a three.

02:54.522 --> 02:55.827
Whoa.

02:56.915 --> 02:58.134
- That's amazing.

02:58.178 --> 02:59.309
So cool.

02:59.353 --> 03:00.571
I wanna do that too.

03:00.615 --> 03:01.964
It can't be that difficult.

03:02.007 --> 03:03.879
- Okay, this is gonna be easy.

03:03.922 --> 03:06.447
- Are you sure you
can do it Teresa?

03:07.839 --> 03:09.885
- It's just I
can't stand apples.

03:09.928 --> 03:13.280
- Don't worry dude,
not a problem.

03:13.323 --> 03:14.585
There, that's better.

03:14.629 --> 03:16.370
What do you say Teresa,
up to the challenge?

03:18.067 --> 03:18.850
- Here we go.

03:18.894 --> 03:20.417
Are you ready?

03:21.592 --> 03:22.811
- Nothing.

03:22.854 --> 03:23.812
Teresa thinks
she's William Tell.

03:24.769 --> 03:25.683
Wait!

03:25.727 --> 03:27.598
- Hey, you need to stand still.

03:27.642 --> 03:29.383
- C'mon, let's see
who can get higher.

03:29.426 --> 03:30.297
Hey, that's cheating.

03:30.340 --> 03:31.254
- Cut that out, Tim.

03:31.298 --> 03:32.212
Come down.

03:32.255 --> 03:33.604
Stop playing around.

03:33.648 --> 03:35.650
- For an elf, your
really boring, you know?

03:35.693 --> 03:37.129
Working all day long.

03:38.305 --> 03:40.176
Don't you ever wanna have fun?

03:40.220 --> 03:41.046
C'mon.

03:42.700 --> 03:44.224
What are you doing?

03:46.008 --> 03:46.835
- Got you!

03:46.878 --> 03:48.358
- What a disaster.

03:50.142 --> 03:51.100
- I'm having fun.

03:51.143 --> 03:54.103
- Well, you're the only one.

03:54.146 --> 03:57.019
- C'mon, Teresa,
we're getting far.

03:58.194 --> 03:59.804
- Hey, stand still.

04:01.284 --> 04:03.112
- What a loser.

04:03.155 --> 04:03.982
- No, no ,no.

04:04.026 --> 04:04.853
No need to worry.

04:04.896 --> 04:05.941
You'll get that photo.

04:05.984 --> 04:08.509
I won't let you down.

04:08.552 --> 04:10.467
The biggest magazine
in the whole country

04:10.511 --> 04:12.904
wants one of my photos!

04:15.167 --> 04:16.952
Teresa, I'm going to.

04:17.822 --> 04:19.302
Okay honey, I'm coming.

04:19.346 --> 04:20.260
I'm coming.

04:22.914 --> 04:25.134
Don't cry, sweetie.

04:25.177 --> 04:27.658
Mommy's really happy.

04:27.702 --> 04:30.008
C'mon, let's see what
your sister's doing.

04:30.052 --> 04:31.532
Do you wanna go down
and play and with them?

04:33.664 --> 04:34.883
Are you set?

04:34.926 --> 04:36.406
- No, I'm too scared.

04:36.450 --> 04:37.277
Whoa!

04:37.320 --> 04:38.539
That was close.

04:39.540 --> 04:40.758
The window!

04:40.802 --> 04:41.629
- Oh, no!

04:43.239 --> 04:45.285
Oh man, what have I done!

04:46.764 --> 04:48.157
No!

04:48.200 --> 04:49.854
No Lucas, sit still!

04:51.029 --> 04:52.379
Oh no, mom's camera.

04:52.422 --> 04:53.597
Where's John?

04:53.641 --> 04:54.946
- Teresa.

04:54.990 --> 04:56.774
- Oh, my mother see it.

05:01.126 --> 05:02.519
We were just playing.

05:02.563 --> 05:03.651
- Yeah, yeah, that's right.

05:03.694 --> 05:05.435
Just playing.

05:08.308 --> 05:09.134
Oh wow.

05:12.399 --> 05:14.314
Look at that pretty butterfly.

05:14.357 --> 05:15.489
It's beautiful.

05:15.532 --> 05:17.708
Where's my camera?

05:17.752 --> 05:18.579
Huh, what!

05:20.145 --> 05:22.191
What happened to it?

05:22.234 --> 05:25.368
Oh my goodness, it's broken.

05:25.412 --> 05:27.022
What am I gonna do?

05:27.065 --> 05:28.371
Teresa!

05:29.503 --> 05:30.330
Get off me.

05:30.373 --> 05:31.548
- Teresa.

05:31.592 --> 05:33.811
Teresa, do you realize
what you've done?

05:33.855 --> 05:35.030
- I'm outta here.

05:35.073 --> 05:35.987
- Wait.

05:36.031 --> 05:36.858
- I'm coming with you.

05:36.901 --> 05:38.076
- Me too!

05:38.120 --> 05:38.903
- We have to get
everything around here

05:38.947 --> 05:40.165
ready for spring time.

05:40.209 --> 05:41.645
- Oh, give me a
break, will you bro?

05:41.689 --> 05:43.212
- I hope you wise up soon.

05:43.255 --> 05:46.302
Ever since we got here,
you've been acting like a,

05:46.346 --> 05:47.172
a buffoon.

05:49.653 --> 05:52.221
Not even the oldest elves
use that word anymore, Todd.

05:52.264 --> 05:53.265
- You're wasting my time.

05:53.309 --> 05:54.571
You're so out of line.

05:54.615 --> 05:56.007
- And you're so boring.

05:56.051 --> 05:57.705
You guys are a bunch of robots.

05:57.748 --> 05:59.446
I mean honestly,
it's springtime,

05:59.489 --> 06:00.969
it's springtime.

06:01.012 --> 06:02.579
We have to get everything around
here ready for springtime.

06:02.623 --> 06:03.580
- But that's our mission.

06:03.624 --> 06:04.973
The point of the expedition.

06:05.016 --> 06:07.062
- Alright, let's
create springtime,

06:07.105 --> 06:08.716
but why we can't enjoy it too.

06:08.759 --> 06:10.718
This place is crazy.

06:10.761 --> 06:11.980
- What you mean is charming,

06:12.023 --> 06:14.112
enthralling, astonishing.

06:14.156 --> 06:15.940
- Amazing, crazy, astonishing.

06:15.984 --> 06:17.333
Who cares?

06:17.377 --> 06:19.553
Hey, who lives here anyway?

06:19.596 --> 06:21.424
Elves like you and me?

06:21.468 --> 06:22.686
- Cut that out.

06:22.730 --> 06:25.210
- That is none of your
concern, young Tim.

06:25.254 --> 06:26.168
- Another killjoy.

06:26.211 --> 06:27.604
- Tim, you're embarrassing me.

06:27.648 --> 06:29.780
Some respect for
your elders, please.

06:29.824 --> 06:31.391
- This is the land
of the humans.

06:31.434 --> 06:33.305
Giants who cannot
be trusted at all.

06:33.349 --> 06:34.959
They are bad news
for us the small.

06:36.308 --> 06:37.832
- Close attention
aids comprehension.

06:38.963 --> 06:40.661
- Wow, I love this place!

06:40.704 --> 06:41.792
It's incredible.

06:41.836 --> 06:43.620
- No, you do not understand.

06:43.664 --> 06:45.883
This is not our era
nor is this our land.

06:45.927 --> 06:48.016
Creating springtime is
the only task at hand.

06:51.106 --> 06:53.151
Question time is over.

06:53.195 --> 06:54.675
Anyone who enters
into their world

06:54.718 --> 06:56.546
never comes back, ever.

06:56.590 --> 06:58.026
- Question times over.

06:58.940 --> 07:00.115
I wanna know.

07:00.158 --> 07:01.986
- Try to forget about them.

07:02.030 --> 07:04.119
Our true home is faraway.

07:04.162 --> 07:07.078
I suggest the pair of you
should do some work today.

07:07.122 --> 07:09.559
Come on, come on, get to work.

07:09.603 --> 07:10.604
- Yes, that's right.

07:10.647 --> 07:11.648
Get to work.

07:12.780 --> 07:13.650
- C'mon, Todd.

07:13.694 --> 07:14.912
You're such a coward.

07:14.956 --> 07:17.045
Nothing's gonna happen
if we explore a little.

07:17.088 --> 07:18.394
- What a ridiculous suggestion.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.396
- It's obvious you
paid no attention.

07:20.440 --> 07:23.181
Besides, I'm sure
those humans can't be so bad

07:23.225 --> 07:24.748
if they live in a
place like this.

07:25.793 --> 07:27.229
- You're so stubborn.

07:27.272 --> 07:28.273
Wait for me!

07:30.537 --> 07:31.755
- You're unbelievable.

07:31.799 --> 07:33.104
Do you realized
what you've done?

07:33.148 --> 07:34.889
This camera is how
I earn my living.

07:34.932 --> 07:35.977
Do you understand?

07:36.020 --> 07:37.848
- Yes, it was an accident.

07:37.892 --> 07:39.589
- We'll I hope it
wasn't on purpose.

07:39.633 --> 07:41.504
What can I say to the
people from the magazine?

07:41.548 --> 07:43.071
What were you thinking of?

07:43.114 --> 07:44.289
- It was Lucas's fault.

07:45.203 --> 07:46.640
Yes, it was your fault.

07:46.683 --> 07:47.554
- No more excuses.

07:49.033 --> 07:50.644
Yes, I know you're
hungry for one.

07:50.687 --> 07:52.646
And you go inside and
start doing your homework.

07:52.689 --> 07:53.864
We'll discuss this later.

07:53.908 --> 07:56.127
- I don't have any.
- Homework!

07:58.086 --> 07:59.000
- Forget them.

07:59.043 --> 08:00.305
They can't seriously think.

08:00.349 --> 08:03.265
My only aim in life
is to be like them.

08:03.308 --> 08:04.875
There has to be
more than life than,

08:04.919 --> 08:05.746
I don't know.

08:05.789 --> 08:07.922
There's just gotta be.

08:07.965 --> 08:09.314
Oh!

08:09.358 --> 08:10.577
Music!

08:10.620 --> 08:12.230
Todd, c'mon, hurry up!

08:12.274 --> 08:14.015
- Tim, come back, I say!

08:14.058 --> 08:15.538
You can't go so far away.

08:15.582 --> 08:16.931
- Get off my case bro.

08:16.974 --> 08:18.410
C'mon, come with me.

08:18.454 --> 08:20.108
- Don't me go down to my knees.

08:20.151 --> 08:21.544
Come back here immediately.

08:21.588 --> 08:24.112
- I just wanna where
the music's coming from.

08:25.592 --> 08:26.723
It's the call.

08:26.767 --> 08:27.985
Tim, turn around.

08:28.029 --> 08:29.334
We get in trouble
if we don't go now.

08:29.378 --> 08:30.553
Don't be
such a scaredy cat.

08:31.598 --> 08:33.513
Alright, do what you like.

08:33.556 --> 08:35.602
- I don't think it's a problem
if we take a look around.

08:35.645 --> 08:37.385
No one's ever gonna notice.

08:37.429 --> 08:38.518
Ah, forget him.

08:38.561 --> 08:39.519
He's a wimp.

08:39.562 --> 08:40.607
A total wimp.

08:43.044 --> 08:44.567
What in a world?

08:47.744 --> 08:49.354
- Step right up, step right up.

08:49.398 --> 08:50.530
See the show.

08:52.749 --> 08:55.578
- Wow, get a load
of these humans.

08:55.622 --> 08:56.797
They really are giants

08:56.840 --> 08:59.060
and this seems super fun.

08:59.103 --> 09:00.322
Hey you!

09:00.365 --> 09:01.802
Look where you're
going, will you?

09:01.845 --> 09:03.151
Can't you see me?

09:03.194 --> 09:04.544
Whoa, here I go!

09:06.763 --> 09:07.982
That was a bump.

09:08.025 --> 09:10.593
Whoa, what kind of
human are you anyway?

09:10.637 --> 09:13.074
Man, that's seriously tall.

09:13.117 --> 09:16.468
Those other humans have
gone nothing on you.

09:16.512 --> 09:17.731
Wait, don't go.

09:18.645 --> 09:19.863
Hi there, I'm Tim.

09:19.907 --> 09:21.909
What's your name, buddy?

09:34.399 --> 09:35.575
- I don't know.

09:39.709 --> 09:40.580
- Check it out.

09:40.623 --> 09:42.016
He strangled him.

09:42.059 --> 09:43.583
- What a waste of time.

09:43.626 --> 09:44.888
- I'm sorry.

09:44.932 --> 09:47.282
It's just this poor
guy is a little old.

09:47.325 --> 09:48.152
- Huh, I'm outta here.

09:48.196 --> 09:49.023
- Me too.

09:51.808 --> 09:53.201
- The end.

09:53.244 --> 09:54.637
- Losing money, losing money.

09:54.681 --> 09:55.943
Left, right and center.

09:55.986 --> 09:57.640
This business will
be the ruin of me.

09:57.684 --> 10:00.687
- Sir, maybe if we could
fix up the show a little.

10:00.730 --> 10:02.776
The puppet theater
won't last much longer.

10:02.819 --> 10:04.516
It's old and it's
falling to pieces.

10:04.560 --> 10:06.170
- I hate those plastic puppets.

10:06.214 --> 10:08.390
- Maybe if we gave
it a lick a paint?

10:08.433 --> 10:11.785
- We'd still have the
stupid old ragdoll show.

10:11.828 --> 10:13.787
We could've been the
biggest circus attraction

10:13.830 --> 10:15.832
in the Big Zapata Fair.

10:15.876 --> 10:17.094
If it wasn't for.

10:17.138 --> 10:18.705
- I prefer not to talk about it.

10:18.748 --> 10:21.577
- The great Sam has
an unlucky accident.

10:21.621 --> 10:23.448
And after walking away unharmed,

10:23.492 --> 10:25.668
gives up the trapeze.

10:25.712 --> 10:27.148
You coward.

10:27.191 --> 10:30.064
How could you do a
thing like that to me?

10:30.107 --> 10:32.240
We had the whole
world in our feet.

10:32.283 --> 10:33.807
- I don't know Mr. Vladimir.

10:33.850 --> 10:35.460
I don't know what
happened to me.

10:35.504 --> 10:37.027
- Then I'll tell you.

10:37.071 --> 10:40.552
You have always been a coward
and you always will be.

10:40.596 --> 10:42.119
If it hadn't been for me,

10:42.163 --> 10:44.513
there's no way you would have
managed to become the best.

10:44.556 --> 10:45.514
- I know sir,

10:45.557 --> 10:47.255
and I will always be grateful.

10:47.298 --> 10:48.517
- Look at you now.

10:48.560 --> 10:50.258
Not even the
wimpiest kid in town

10:50.301 --> 10:52.477
is scared of heights as you.

10:52.521 --> 10:53.348
Chicken.

10:53.391 --> 10:54.218
- Please let it go, sir.

10:54.262 --> 10:55.176
- I will not.

10:55.219 --> 10:56.699
I am not prepared to carry on

10:56.743 --> 10:59.484
bankrupting myself with
your pathetic puppets.

10:59.528 --> 11:01.399
Either things look
up around here

11:01.443 --> 11:03.663
or you can find
yourself another job.

11:03.706 --> 11:04.925
- Yes, sir.

11:04.968 --> 11:07.710
I guess I better go
see to the stall.

11:09.538 --> 11:12.584
- Where the giant
elf disappeared to?

11:12.628 --> 11:14.543
Wow, what kind of
elves are they?

11:14.586 --> 11:15.370
Hey, I'm Tim.

11:15.413 --> 11:16.414
Who are you?

11:17.764 --> 11:19.113
What's up with you?

11:19.156 --> 11:20.505
Why so quiet, guys?

11:20.549 --> 11:21.419
Hey!

11:21.463 --> 11:22.769
Yoohoo!

11:22.812 --> 11:23.770
Hey!

11:23.813 --> 11:24.727
Well, that's just rude.

11:24.771 --> 11:26.250
See you.

11:26.294 --> 11:28.035
I can have plenty
of fun on my own.

11:28.078 --> 11:28.905
Woohoo!

11:32.430 --> 11:33.518
- Am I seeing what
I think I'm seeing?

11:33.562 --> 11:34.432
Impossible.

11:35.782 --> 11:37.261
Excuse me.

11:37.305 --> 11:39.263
That trapeze artist stuff
you've got on the display there.

11:41.091 --> 11:45.661
If you like, I think this
one is an expert juggler.

11:45.705 --> 11:46.923
- It's okay, forget it.

I'm sorry.

11:55.323 --> 11:56.106
Got you.

11:56.150 --> 11:57.891
- Hey, wait a second.

12:02.852 --> 12:04.549
- Nothing, they're
not picking up.

12:04.593 --> 12:06.856
- Mom, do you wanna
see a two

12:06.900 --> 12:08.162
- Teresa, please honey,

12:08.205 --> 12:10.512
can't you see I'm trying
to make a phone call?

12:10.555 --> 12:12.601
C'mon, honey, don't cry.

12:12.644 --> 12:13.428
- But look,

12:13.471 --> 12:14.951
I learned it off the TV.

12:14.995 --> 12:16.387
- Nobody's answering
this number either.

12:16.431 --> 12:18.259
- Look mom, here I go!

12:19.390 --> 12:20.478
- Be careful!

12:20.522 --> 12:21.566
What are you doing?

12:21.610 --> 12:22.785
Are you hurt?

12:22.829 --> 12:23.786
I'm fine.

12:23.830 --> 12:25.266
- But what gave you the idea

12:25.309 --> 12:26.571
you could wear your roller
skates in the house?

12:26.615 --> 12:27.834
- But I finished
my homework, mom.

12:32.055 --> 12:32.839
Now listen.

12:32.882 --> 12:34.275
I'm gonna tidy the yard.

12:34.318 --> 12:35.711
You keep John entertained,

12:35.755 --> 12:36.799
and no complaining.

12:36.843 --> 12:38.801
- Oh, so unfair.

12:38.845 --> 12:40.977
And don't you laugh, okay?

I know a game that we can play.

12:55.600 --> 12:56.993
What's all the yelling about?

12:57.037 --> 12:57.951
- Hi, Martin.

12:57.994 --> 12:59.126
I'm think I'm going crazy.

12:59.169 --> 13:00.736
- Well, don't get stressed.

13:00.780 --> 13:02.825
It's nothing that can't be
put right with a little yoga.

13:02.869 --> 13:04.174
Hey, Martin.
What you got there?

13:04.218 --> 13:05.610
- Teresa, don't
touch the vegetable.

13:05.654 --> 13:07.047
- It's okay, Ester.

13:07.090 --> 13:09.092
As long as she's careful,
it's not a problem.

13:09.136 --> 13:11.312
Look, they are all
grown organically.

13:11.355 --> 13:12.879

little carrot.

13:12.922 --> 13:15.533
- They're small but tasty
and most of all, healthy.

13:15.577 --> 13:16.839
Now where should I put 'em?

13:16.883 --> 13:17.666
- Right here.

13:17.709 --> 13:18.928
Sorry about the mess

13:18.972 --> 13:20.495
but today's turning
into a disaster.

13:20.538 --> 13:21.931
I have to take some photos
and my camera's broken.

13:21.975 --> 13:22.976
- Well, it wasn't my fault.

13:23.019 --> 13:24.542
- Not another word out of you.

13:24.586 --> 13:25.805
- It's okay, Ester.

13:25.848 --> 13:27.328
I'm sure we can
work out a solution.

13:27.371 --> 13:29.504
- I'm trying to call the
store but they won't pick up.

13:29.547 --> 13:31.071
I don't know what to do.

13:31.114 --> 13:32.376
- The best thing would be
to go straight to the store.

13:32.420 --> 13:33.638
- Yeah, you think I
have time for that?

13:33.682 --> 13:36.380
- Sure, I can keep
an this feral rascal.

13:37.338 --> 13:38.252
Would you do that?

13:38.295 --> 13:39.383
- Only too happy.

13:39.427 --> 13:40.732
You know Teresa and I

13:40.776 --> 13:42.647
get on like a house on
fire, isn't that right?

13:42.691 --> 13:44.127
And between the two of us,

13:44.171 --> 13:46.129
I'm sure we can handle
that other little munchkin.

13:46.173 --> 13:47.000
- Of course, we can, mom.

13:47.043 --> 13:48.871
You don't have to worry.

13:48.915 --> 13:50.830
- You don't know how much
I appreciate this Martin.

13:50.873 --> 13:53.136
You're the best
neighbor in the world.

13:53.180 --> 13:54.746
- Yeah sure, you're
always saying that

13:54.790 --> 13:56.357
'cause I grow my
own veggies, right?

13:58.533 --> 14:00.143
Teresa, be on your best behavior

14:00.187 --> 14:01.623
and do what Martin say, okay?

14:01.666 --> 14:03.103
- Aren't you going to
say anything to John?

14:03.146 --> 14:04.756
- Take care of him.

14:06.454 --> 14:08.021
- You've got a nerve.

14:08.064 --> 14:13.069
- Like I said, I little yoga
would do you guys a lotta good.

14:13.113 --> 14:13.983
Hey mister, wait.

14:14.027 --> 14:14.897
I wanna balloon.

14:14.941 --> 14:16.116
Mister, hey!

14:16.159 --> 14:17.160
- Sir, sir.

14:17.204 --> 14:18.509
You're not gonna
believe what I--

14:18.553 --> 14:19.597
- Not now, Sam.

14:19.641 --> 14:20.903
Don't bother me.

14:20.947 --> 14:22.470
- But sir, it's
totally incredible.

14:22.513 --> 14:24.559
- Totally incredible would
be a huge crowd of people

14:24.602 --> 14:26.822
handing all their money to me.

14:26.866 --> 14:27.692
- Look!

14:29.607 --> 14:30.870
Is that what I think it is?

14:30.913 --> 14:32.697
- It's an elf, just like
the ones in the fair.

14:32.741 --> 14:34.264
- Get off.
- But this one is real.

14:34.308 --> 14:35.222
- Let me see.

14:35.265 --> 14:36.310
- Hey, watch what you're doing.

14:36.353 --> 14:37.311
You're squashing me.

14:38.878 --> 14:39.922
- Well, stripe me down.

14:39.966 --> 14:41.837
It really is a real elf.

14:41.881 --> 14:43.795
- Isn't it amazing,
Mr. Vladimir?

14:43.839 --> 14:47.016
I had no idea these
things really existed.

14:47.060 --> 14:48.844
- It's going to
save our skins, Sam.

14:48.888 --> 14:49.714
- What is this
guy talking about?

14:49.758 --> 14:50.846
- Rich at last!

14:50.890 --> 14:52.065
Rich!

14:52.108 --> 14:53.675
- I'm glad you're so
happy about this, boss.

14:54.937 --> 14:56.199
- He was in the
fair, playing around.

14:56.243 --> 14:57.897
- It has to be him.

14:57.940 --> 14:59.072
Of course, it is!

15:00.377 --> 15:01.639
- It was many years ago,

15:01.683 --> 15:03.511
I was still just a kid
and an old friend and I

15:03.554 --> 15:05.295
found a critter just like this.

15:05.339 --> 15:06.296
You're the critter.

15:06.340 --> 15:08.037
- I like it!
- Hey, careful!

15:08.081 --> 15:11.954
- It looks like congratulations,
you're in order, Sam.

15:11.998 --> 15:13.086
Let's see, where it is?

15:13.129 --> 15:14.435
It must be somewhere here.

15:14.478 --> 15:15.958
Ah, here it is.

15:16.002 --> 15:17.612
Our little friend is
going to give us the boost

15:17.655 --> 15:19.222
that you and I need.

15:19.266 --> 15:20.571
- He does seem pretty smart.

15:20.615 --> 15:21.964
- You're telling me.

15:22.008 --> 15:24.140
- If he's the elf we
found when we were kids,

15:24.184 --> 15:26.534
my father knew exactly
what to do with him.

15:26.577 --> 15:28.840
He made a lot of money
with that old show of his.

15:28.884 --> 15:31.191
A lot of people
thought it was a scam

15:31.234 --> 15:34.281
but their curiosity
made my dad a rich man.

15:35.891 --> 15:38.415
- Ah, one terrible day, he
disappeared without a trace.

15:38.459 --> 15:41.157
And all he left us was
this ridiculous pot plant.

15:41.201 --> 15:42.593
I don't even know
how it's still alive.

15:42.637 --> 15:44.639
Now, listen very carefully.

15:44.682 --> 15:48.948
From now on, you and I are
going to be very good friends.

15:48.991 --> 15:50.036
- Give me a break, dude.

15:50.079 --> 15:50.993
No way, Jose.

15:52.734 --> 15:55.215
- Still as rebellious
as he used to be.

15:55.258 --> 15:56.433
Yes, indeed, no doubt about it.

15:56.477 --> 15:57.782
- Let me go, let me go.

15:57.826 --> 16:00.481
Let me go!
- You are one and the same.

16:02.178 --> 16:04.006
Welcome to the circus.

16:05.486 --> 16:07.009
- That guy has definitely
got a screw loose.

16:07.053 --> 16:11.927
Don't worry, it's
not such a bad place to live.

16:17.672 --> 16:19.891
- We're getting a long
way from our route.

16:19.935 --> 16:22.198
- Let's carry on, please.

16:22.242 --> 16:23.939
He might be behind those trees.

16:23.983 --> 16:25.201
- I'm not so certain.

16:25.245 --> 16:27.725
I think the humans
must have caught him.

16:27.769 --> 16:29.423
- Hm, if so, it's clear.

16:29.466 --> 16:31.903
Our search must stop right here.

16:31.947 --> 16:34.036
There's nothing
more that we can do.

16:34.080 --> 16:35.603
- But we can't just.

16:35.646 --> 16:39.563
- I'm sorry, we can't out
anyone else in danger.

16:39.607 --> 16:41.957
C'mon, c'mon, we can't
afford to stay here.

16:42.001 --> 16:43.132
- Our brother is right.

16:43.176 --> 16:44.655
Time waits to no one

16:44.699 --> 16:46.570
and there is still so
much work to be done.

16:48.094 --> 16:49.747
- I sorry, we're through.

16:49.791 --> 16:51.967
There's nothing we can do.

16:53.316 --> 16:55.884
- I hope you make it in the end.

16:55.927 --> 16:57.668
Good luck, my friend.

16:59.105 --> 17:01.020
- Yeah, you stay there.

17:02.325 --> 17:04.632
Now, show me what you
can do, little star.

17:05.675 --> 17:07.069
- Cut the chat and get dancing.

17:07.983 --> 17:09.244
You're out of your mind.

17:09.289 --> 17:10.550
- Get dancing, I say!

17:10.594 --> 17:12.596
- Okay, if you're
asking like that,

17:12.640 --> 17:14.337
so nicely and politely.

17:18.689 --> 17:19.864
- Here we go.

17:19.907 --> 17:21.561
A crate of taters.

17:21.605 --> 17:23.825
- And one of many carrots.

17:23.867 --> 17:24.913
What a pain!

17:24.955 --> 17:26.132
Will you please leave me alone?

17:26.175 --> 17:28.395
- C'mon, all he wants
to do is play with you.

17:28.438 --> 17:29.483
- I don't.

17:29.526 --> 17:31.093
I'm really mad at him.

17:32.138 --> 17:33.617
- He's a troublemaker.

17:33.661 --> 17:35.576
And mom always ends up
blaming me for everything.

17:35.619 --> 17:37.491
- Your mom works way too hard.

17:37.534 --> 17:40.233
- She always yells
at me, never at John.

17:40.276 --> 17:41.234
Cut it out!

17:42.583 --> 17:44.106
- C'mon, little monkey.

17:44.150 --> 17:46.500
So you like my carrots , do you?

17:46.543 --> 17:48.719
- Mom just doesn't like me.

17:48.763 --> 17:51.157
- This is the
perfect spot for you.

17:51.200 --> 17:53.333
Now Teresa, listen up.

17:53.376 --> 17:55.335
Your mom loves you
both like crazy.

17:55.378 --> 17:56.597
Not me.

17:56.640 --> 17:58.120
- She wanted to
have you so much,

17:58.164 --> 18:00.122
she went ahead even
though she was on her own.

18:00.166 --> 18:01.558
And you know, to do
something like that,

18:01.602 --> 18:04.083
you have to be a
very brave person.

18:04.126 --> 18:05.519
Okay, pass me that crate.

18:05.562 --> 18:08.565
- I hope sell
taters at the fair.

18:08.609 --> 18:10.393
- Oh, look what have we here.

18:10.437 --> 18:12.700
There's a little caterpillar
on my vegetables.

18:12.743 --> 18:14.658
C'mon, little munchkin.

18:16.399 --> 18:18.880
- Good, good, that's
what I like to see.

18:18.923 --> 18:20.099
Keep it up.

18:20.142 --> 18:23.972
♪ I've got to get out of here

18:25.060 --> 18:26.322
This is my chance.

18:26.366 --> 18:27.758
- Hey you, Sam!

18:27.802 --> 18:30.370
Look out, he's getting away!

18:30.413 --> 18:31.675
Little pest.

18:31.719 --> 18:33.242
- It's better if you
don't make him mad.

18:33.286 --> 18:35.288
If you did that trapeze over
here, he'll be super happy.

18:35.331 --> 18:36.158
Go on, try it.

18:37.681 --> 18:38.769
Leave me alone.

18:38.813 --> 18:39.988
- Dance, I said.

18:40.031 --> 18:40.989
C'mon!

18:41.032 --> 18:42.382
Oh, he'll do it, sir.

18:42.425 --> 18:43.948
- I'll show you.

18:43.992 --> 18:46.168
Be careful.

18:46.212 --> 18:47.300
- Hey there you two.

18:48.214 --> 18:49.171
- Not too well.

18:49.215 --> 18:50.172
I stuck it back together.

18:50.216 --> 18:51.347
Let's see how it holds up.

18:51.391 --> 18:52.305
You guys okay?

18:52.348 --> 18:53.480
- We've had a fantastic time.

18:53.523 --> 18:54.307
- High five!
- Everything's ready

18:54.350 --> 18:55.264
for the fair.

18:55.308 --> 18:56.439
- Thank you os much, Martin.

18:56.483 --> 18:57.658
- Hey, I got an idea.

18:57.701 --> 18:59.312
Why don't you guys
come along to the fair.

18:59.355 --> 19:02.141
While I'm working on the stall,
you can take a look around.

19:02.184 --> 19:03.011
- Yes, yes.

19:03.054 --> 19:03.794
Mom, say yes.

19:03.838 --> 19:04.795
- I don't know.

19:04.839 --> 19:05.753
Don't forget, young lady.

19:05.796 --> 19:07.189
I'm still very annoyed with you.

19:07.233 --> 19:08.930
- See, she doesn't like me.

19:08.973 --> 19:11.933
- C'mon now, Teresa's been
working like a true champion.

19:11.976 --> 19:13.674
She helped me load
everything onto the truck.

19:13.717 --> 19:15.023
- Oh, please.

19:15.066 --> 19:16.590
- Oh, alright.

19:16.633 --> 19:18.548
I guess it would do me good to
take my mind off things too.

19:18.592 --> 19:20.202
- Yey!

19:20.246 --> 19:22.073
- Look out, my camera.

19:24.250 --> 19:25.425
- Wow.

19:25.468 --> 19:26.469
- Teresa, stay
close to me, honey.

19:26.513 --> 19:27.427
- Mom, I want one.

19:27.470 --> 19:28.471
Will you buy me one?

19:28.515 --> 19:30.125
Please, pretty please.

19:30.169 --> 19:32.606
After you've had your lunch.

19:32.649 --> 19:34.390
Oh great, that's all we needed.

19:34.434 --> 19:35.609
What, you too?

19:37.306 --> 19:38.177
C'mon now.

19:42.268 --> 19:43.704
- Wow.

19:43.747 --> 19:45.967
Mom, how about this one?

19:46.968 --> 19:48.448
Don't even and think about it.

19:48.491 --> 19:50.667
What, you want me to have
a heart attack on the spot?

19:50.711 --> 19:51.973
- This one.

19:52.016 --> 19:52.626
Can I have some
money for this one?

19:52.669 --> 19:53.583
I wanna try.

19:53.627 --> 19:54.932
- No way.

19:54.976 --> 19:56.369
First, you have to
eat your sandwich.

19:56.412 --> 20:00.024
- Oh, you won't
let me do anything.

20:00.068 --> 20:01.112
Where are you going?

20:01.156 --> 20:02.853
Teresa, wait.

20:04.594 --> 20:06.205
What?

20:06.248 --> 20:07.293
I don't believe it.

20:07.336 --> 20:09.120
I get nothing John gets it all.

20:09.164 --> 20:10.078
I hate you!

20:10.121 --> 20:11.079
- Teresa, come back here.

20:11.122 --> 20:11.949
- No!

20:15.866 --> 20:17.216
What's going on?

20:17.259 --> 20:18.956
What are they watching?

20:19.000 --> 20:21.524
- Ladies and gentlemen,
girls and boys.

20:21.568 --> 20:23.265
Step up and take a good look

20:23.309 --> 20:25.136
at one of the true
wonders of nature.

20:25.180 --> 20:26.747
There are no string to move him

20:26.790 --> 20:28.836
and he's not a
battery-powered doll.

20:28.879 --> 20:32.056
He's a genuine springtime
elf here to entertain you

20:32.100 --> 20:34.537
with this traditional
elf dances.

20:35.625 --> 20:37.018
I wanna see it.

20:42.371 --> 20:43.242
- C'mon.

20:46.070 --> 20:46.897
Boo!

20:46.941 --> 20:48.551
- C'mon, c'mon, dance

20:48.595 --> 20:50.118
You dance.

20:50.161 --> 20:51.685
- No need to get upset, our
elf is a real is a real artist.

20:51.728 --> 20:53.208
He takes while to warm up.

20:53.252 --> 20:54.514
C'mon, dance.

20:54.557 --> 20:56.080
I said no.

20:58.605 --> 21:00.128
- That miserable
elf won't budge.

21:00.171 --> 21:01.521
You know what you have to do.

21:01.564 --> 21:02.391
- But, sir.

21:02.435 --> 21:03.436
- Do it now!

21:05.351 --> 21:07.091
- If you insist, sir.

21:10.443 --> 21:12.227
I sorry little buddy.

21:13.272 --> 21:14.098
- Aw!

21:14.142 --> 21:15.143
That stings!

21:26.807 --> 21:28.678
- That's so funny.

21:28.722 --> 21:30.767
- Since when is that a
traditional elf dance?

21:32.029 --> 21:33.553
The way it moves, you
think it was real.

21:33.596 --> 21:35.294
Bravo, bravo!

21:35.337 --> 21:37.208
- Thank you, thank you.

21:37.252 --> 21:39.123
I'm so glad you
enjoyed the show.

21:39.167 --> 21:40.690
Thank you.

21:40.734 --> 21:42.431
We'll be back tomorrow
the same time.

21:42.475 --> 21:44.694
Thank you, thank you.

21:44.738 --> 21:46.392
It's a hit, it's a huge hit.

21:46.435 --> 21:48.089
- You can't can't
keep me locked up.

21:48.132 --> 21:49.917
- I think we can,
my little friend.

21:49.960 --> 21:51.527
You belong to me now.

21:51.571 --> 21:53.137
- I'll escape.

21:53.181 --> 21:57.098
- Try that one more time
and I'll fry you to a crisp.

21:58.752 --> 22:00.057
What do you
think you're doing?

22:00.101 --> 22:02.233
- Mom, you really scared me.

22:02.277 --> 22:03.496
- Not as scared as I've been.

22:03.539 --> 22:05.280
I've been looking for
you for 20 minutes.

22:05.324 --> 22:06.934
Never do this to me again.

22:06.977 --> 22:07.978
Why did you ran off?

22:08.022 --> 22:09.458
- Because I'm sick of it.

22:09.502 --> 22:11.460
You bought John a balloon
and I get nothing.

22:11.504 --> 22:13.723
- Teresa, please,
he's just a baby.

22:13.767 --> 22:15.464
He started crying and
it was the only way

22:15.508 --> 22:16.857
I could calm him down.

22:16.900 --> 22:18.554
- I'm small too, you know.

22:18.598 --> 22:20.687
- Teresa honey, you're
eight years old.

22:21.731 --> 22:22.993
I still wanna be small.

22:23.037 --> 22:25.344
- Alright, which ride
do you wanna go on?

22:25.387 --> 22:27.433
- You don't like me, I know it.

22:28.738 --> 22:30.131
You're my special little girl.

22:30.174 --> 22:31.959
- Right, you're
just saying that.

22:32.002 --> 22:33.221
- C'mon, sweetie.

22:33.264 --> 22:35.832
Give me a smile and
let's go have some fun.

22:35.876 --> 22:37.399
- Ladies, ladies.

22:37.443 --> 22:38.661
Would you like to try your luck?

22:38.705 --> 22:39.880
Win a prize, guaranteed.

22:39.923 --> 22:40.707
Give it a try.

22:42.491 --> 22:43.362
- Go on, go ahead.

22:43.405 --> 22:44.580
- Here we go then.

22:44.624 --> 22:45.842
If you knock over the
stack of tin cans,

22:45.886 --> 22:47.453
you win a beautiful
plush elf doll.

22:47.496 --> 22:51.370
- I want the one you
got locked up in there.

22:51.413 --> 22:54.329
- The things kids
come up with, huh.

22:55.896 --> 22:56.853
I'm sorry.

22:56.897 --> 22:57.941
- I'm sorry.

22:57.985 --> 22:59.160
- Oh, I'm fine don't worry.

22:59.203 --> 23:00.683
- You need to be more careful.

23:00.727 --> 23:01.815
This time aim properly.

23:02.946 --> 23:03.904
- Well, of course not.

23:03.947 --> 23:05.035
- Ma'am, it's okay.

23:05.079 --> 23:07.734
We're ready for everything here.

23:08.822 --> 23:09.649
- Right.

23:11.128 --> 23:12.391
- Take that.

23:13.392 --> 23:14.262
- Look out!

23:15.872 --> 23:16.743
Are you okay?

23:16.786 --> 23:17.918
Help!

23:20.007 --> 23:20.964
Now's my chance.

23:23.445 --> 23:24.272
- I'm outta here.

23:24.315 --> 23:25.404
- What a mess.

23:25.447 --> 23:27.449
Mom, mom, I wanna go.

23:27.493 --> 23:29.495
- But Teresa, have you
seen what you've done?

23:29.538 --> 23:31.192
I'm sorry sir.

23:31.235 --> 23:33.368
- I still don't understand
how'd that happened.

23:33.412 --> 23:34.761
Lucky I was wearing the helmet.

23:36.458 --> 23:37.938
Ah, blast!

23:37.981 --> 23:39.156
Find the elf, Sam!

23:40.288 --> 23:41.463
- He's not here.

23:41.507 --> 23:42.725
- That's impossible.

23:42.769 --> 23:43.987
I'm sorry it all
happened so sudden.

23:44.031 --> 23:45.249
- Curses!

23:45.293 --> 23:46.250
If you'd been paying
more attention,

23:46.294 --> 23:47.208
this wouldn't have happened.

23:47.251 --> 23:48.470
You're useless.

23:48.514 --> 23:50.777
- Sir, I--
- You mess things up again.

23:50.820 --> 23:53.649
You're a worthless
little failure.

23:55.172 --> 23:57.436
- Now that wasn't much fun.

23:57.479 --> 24:01.744
- Yeah I know but sometimes
she thinks she does.

24:01.788 --> 24:04.051
We'll thanks anyway,
get some rest.

24:04.094 --> 24:07.489
- You too hon,
tomorrow's another day.

24:07.533 --> 24:10.274
- C'mon, do you realize how
much trouble you caused.

24:10.318 --> 24:12.363
- They were being
mean to a little elf.

24:13.452 --> 24:14.496
Don't make up silly stories.

24:14.540 --> 24:15.410
Get inside.

24:15.454 --> 24:16.716
It's true!

24:16.759 --> 24:18.195
- Hey, hey, no yelling.

24:18.239 --> 24:19.283
I have plenty to yell about too.

24:19.327 --> 24:20.850
- But you never believe me.

24:20.894 --> 24:24.071
Whatever I say, whatever
I do, you always get mad.

24:24.114 --> 24:25.942
- Go up to your room
right this minute.

24:25.986 --> 24:28.336
We'll talk when you've calmed
down and decided to behave.

24:28.379 --> 24:29.380
- Lucas, be quiet!

24:30.991 --> 24:32.035
I said be quiet!

24:32.079 --> 24:34.124
Teresa, please.

24:39.565 --> 24:41.088
- Oh, wow!

24:41.131 --> 24:42.742
You're the,

24:42.785 --> 24:44.047
but you're the.

24:45.092 --> 24:48.008
- The elf from the sideshow.

24:48.051 --> 24:49.749
- And you're real.

24:49.792 --> 24:51.141
- Of course.

24:52.882 --> 24:54.275
- Oh, I knew it.

24:54.318 --> 24:56.582
I was certain that you
weren't just a puppet.

24:56.625 --> 24:58.105
A real life elf.

24:58.148 --> 24:59.498
How'd you get here?

24:59.541 --> 25:00.324
- In there.

25:00.368 --> 25:01.238
- Of course.

25:01.282 --> 25:03.502
You were in my pocket.

25:03.545 --> 25:05.765
Hey, you don't have
to be scared of me.

25:07.201 --> 25:08.898
In the short time I've
been in this world,

25:08.942 --> 25:12.032
I've been chained up,
electrocuted and almost crushed.

25:12.075 --> 25:13.642
I don't know if there's
anyone I can trust.

25:13.686 --> 25:16.602
- It's okay, I'm not
gonna do you any harm.

25:16.645 --> 25:17.646
My name's Teresa.

25:17.690 --> 25:18.560
Who are you?

25:18.604 --> 25:19.518
Do you have a name?

25:19.561 --> 25:20.780
- I'm Tim.

25:20.823 --> 25:21.650
- Tim.

25:21.694 --> 25:23.173
Nice to meet you, Tim.

25:23.217 --> 25:24.392
- Likewise Teresa.

25:24.435 --> 25:25.262
- How amazing.

25:25.306 --> 25:26.481
A real elf.

25:26.525 --> 25:28.875
It's the first time I've
met a real life elf.

25:28.918 --> 25:30.137
Where do you come from?

25:30.180 --> 25:31.704
- I'm from the
world of the elves.

25:31.747 --> 25:34.315
Every spring, we come here
to make your world bloom.

25:35.229 --> 25:36.709
It sounds so magical.

25:36.752 --> 25:38.841
- Of course, this is
the first time for me

25:38.885 --> 25:41.278
and guessing it also be my last.

25:42.976 --> 25:45.500
- Well, that remains to be seen.

25:45.544 --> 25:48.024
But I'm fairly sure the other
elves won't let me come back.

25:48.938 --> 25:50.244
Of course they will.

25:50.287 --> 25:51.680
Introduce them to me
and I'll tell them.

25:51.724 --> 25:54.248
- No, I don't think
that's such a good idea.

25:54.291 --> 25:57.773
Some of them are
really, really annoying.

25:57.817 --> 25:58.948
Yeah, I'm mean they're not bad,

25:58.992 --> 26:00.036
in fact, they're nice guys

26:00.080 --> 26:01.908
but they're so boring.

26:03.213 --> 26:05.781
- I just can't imagine
elves being boring.

26:05.825 --> 26:07.130
- You'd be amazed.

26:07.174 --> 26:09.045
All they think about
is working, working.

26:09.089 --> 26:12.745
Man, I was born to be an
adventurer and explorer,

26:12.788 --> 26:15.182
and all they do is just give
me orders and tell me off.

26:15.225 --> 26:16.575
What a drag.

26:16.618 --> 26:19.621
- Well, I get what
you mean, totally.

26:19.665 --> 26:20.796
- It's like I say to Todd.

26:22.624 --> 26:23.625
- My elf brother.

26:25.148 --> 26:27.629
- Yes, we'll get an elf
brother assigned to us

26:27.673 --> 26:28.891
so we can work together.

26:28.935 --> 26:31.372
- And brothers are
such a pain, right?

26:31.415 --> 26:34.027
- Well, Todd is,
how can I put this?

26:34.070 --> 26:35.594
Todd is a good guy

26:35.637 --> 26:37.204
but he never does anything
except what he's told

26:37.247 --> 26:39.423
and that really
gets on my nerves.

26:39.467 --> 26:41.817
Of course, he's
always going on at me.

26:41.861 --> 26:43.340
Don't do this, don't do that.

26:43.384 --> 26:44.864
- Just like my mom.

26:44.907 --> 26:46.953
From the moment I wake up,
she's bossing me around

26:46.996 --> 26:48.868
and exactly the same at school.

26:48.911 --> 26:51.348
Doing
what you're told is a pain.

26:52.915 --> 26:54.351
- What I like is running.

26:54.395 --> 26:57.137
Running, running
wherever I want.

26:57.180 --> 26:58.834
- Well I like
jumping really high.

26:58.878 --> 26:59.792
Yipee!

26:59.835 --> 27:01.445
- I wanna sing whatever I like.

27:01.489 --> 27:02.838
♪ The fields are full of daisies

27:02.882 --> 27:04.884
♪ They're going crazy

27:04.927 --> 27:07.582
- I wanna get some
roller skates.

27:07.626 --> 27:11.760
Yes, we
love laughing and having fun.

27:13.240 --> 27:14.676
- And don't you think
Todd and the other elves

27:14.720 --> 27:15.982
will be missing you?

27:16.025 --> 27:17.070
- I doubt it.

27:17.113 --> 27:19.507
There's million more like me.

27:22.466 --> 27:23.380
- Tim, Tim!

27:25.600 --> 27:26.427
Tim!

27:28.647 --> 27:30.474
Where are you brother?

27:33.042 --> 27:34.043
A dog?

27:34.087 --> 27:36.002
- Yes, it's our dog, Lucas.

27:36.045 --> 27:37.699
He's super friendly.

27:37.743 --> 27:39.179
You can meet him
tomorrow, you'll see.

27:39.222 --> 27:43.531
- Yeah sure, that
sounds like a monster.

27:43.574 --> 27:44.532
- Of course not.

27:44.575 --> 27:46.229
He's really cuddly.

27:46.273 --> 27:47.709
Bu now, what about you?

27:47.753 --> 27:49.493
What were you doing
the spring fair?

27:49.537 --> 27:50.843
- Looking around and having fun

27:50.886 --> 27:52.714
until those two goons caught me.

27:52.758 --> 27:54.716
- Do you mean they
kidnapped you?

27:54.760 --> 27:56.979
- Yeah, it was a
full scale abduction.

27:57.023 --> 27:58.720
- Whoa, that's horrible.

27:58.764 --> 28:00.548
- They wanted me to dance
for them all the time.

28:00.591 --> 28:02.506
And in fact, I'm a
guy who loves dancing.

28:02.550 --> 28:05.031
- Yeah, but now when
someone tells you to.

28:05.074 --> 28:06.902
- Especially not with
those electric shocks.

28:06.946 --> 28:09.688
They almost singe my
beautiful head of hair.

28:09.731 --> 28:12.429
- Beautiful and colorful.

28:12.473 --> 28:15.041
Wow, I bet you're
really scared, right?

28:15.084 --> 28:16.477
- Well, not so much.

28:16.520 --> 28:17.391
That much.

28:17.434 --> 28:18.740
Only a little bit.

28:18.784 --> 28:20.742
But I'm so glad
that you showed up.

28:20.786 --> 28:22.178
- Yeah, so am I.

28:22.222 --> 28:23.440
- Thanks to your terrible aim,

28:23.484 --> 28:24.964
I managed to escape.

28:25.007 --> 28:26.617
- Hey you, I fired at the
corner post on purpose.

28:26.661 --> 28:29.098
- I know, I'm just joking.

28:29.142 --> 28:31.144
It was actually really cool.

28:31.187 --> 28:33.494
It was super exciting.

28:33.537 --> 28:35.801
- I'm glad I could
I help you out, Tim.

28:35.844 --> 28:37.890
- And I'm glad I met you too.

28:37.933 --> 28:39.892
- We make a good
team, don't you think.

28:39.935 --> 28:41.067
- You're telling me.

28:41.110 --> 28:42.503
You know, I think you're a star.

28:44.853 --> 28:47.247
No one's ever said
that to me before.

28:47.290 --> 28:49.336
- Well, it's true.

28:49.379 --> 28:51.425
If other humans were like
you, I come and live here.

28:51.468 --> 28:52.295
Who's that?

28:52.339 --> 28:53.819
- My mom.

28:53.862 --> 28:55.908
She bugs me as much as your
brother Todd bug to you.

28:55.951 --> 28:57.561
- She looks like a nice person.

28:57.605 --> 28:59.085
- Sometimes she is.

28:59.128 --> 29:01.130
But today for example,
she yelled at me so much.

29:01.174 --> 29:02.653
- Well in that
case, just run away.

29:02.697 --> 29:04.786
- No, I really love my mom.

29:04.830 --> 29:06.701
- I told you she
looked trustworthy.

29:06.745 --> 29:08.007
Not like those other guys.

29:08.877 --> 29:09.748
The ones from the fair?

29:10.749 --> 29:12.098
- No, she's not like them.

29:12.141 --> 29:14.056
Those two really afraid me.

29:14.100 --> 29:16.276
I don't wanna see
them ever again.

29:16.319 --> 29:17.320
- Neither do I.

29:17.364 --> 29:19.192
Never again.

29:19.235 --> 29:20.759
How

29:20.802 --> 29:22.717
Tell me exactly where you
found that retched elf.

29:22.761 --> 29:24.806
- I told you, he was
right here at the fair.

29:24.850 --> 29:28.070
- I will not allow him
to disappear again.

29:28.114 --> 29:30.681
- Wouldn't it be better
to forget about him, sir?

29:30.725 --> 29:31.857
- Out of the question.

29:31.900 --> 29:33.293
You blithering fool.

29:33.336 --> 29:35.425
Find him and bring
him to me now.

29:35.469 --> 29:37.384
Whatever you say sir.

29:37.427 --> 29:38.254
- Teresa.

29:45.000 --> 29:45.827
Teresa.

29:47.002 --> 29:48.264
Are you asleep?

29:52.138 --> 29:55.489
Honey, I'm sorry I
scold you so much.

29:55.532 --> 29:58.013
But sometimes it all
gets too much for me.

29:58.057 --> 30:03.192
And I think I'm so crazy to
try to be mom all in my own.

30:03.236 --> 30:04.672
You're so pretty.

30:06.674 --> 30:08.284
I want you to know
that John and you

30:08.328 --> 30:12.506
are the most beautiful things
that ever happen to me.

30:15.901 --> 30:18.033
Little rascal, I love you.

30:19.426 --> 30:20.427
Sweet dreams honey.

30:20.470 --> 30:21.820
See you tomorrow.

30:28.652 --> 30:30.916
- Hey you, do you know
how lucky you are?

30:32.091 --> 30:33.396
- Your mom really loves you.

30:33.440 --> 30:35.007
- You never talked
about your mom.

30:35.050 --> 30:36.138
- I don't have a mom.

30:36.182 --> 30:37.531
Just tons of brothers.

30:37.574 --> 30:38.837
- And all of you live
in the same house?

30:38.880 --> 30:40.882
- No, look, I'll explain.

30:40.926 --> 30:42.884
In my world, things
aren't like they are here.

30:42.928 --> 30:44.581
There are no houses.

30:52.241 --> 30:53.503
The one and only,

30:53.547 --> 30:56.071
the incomparable,
the great Samuel.

30:56.115 --> 30:58.291
Let's give him a big hand.

31:01.903 --> 31:04.645
- So they kicked out
of gardening class
for the seventh time

31:04.688 --> 31:05.864
and then, huh?

31:07.082 --> 31:07.909
Teresa?

31:09.389 --> 31:13.567
Right, I can see you're not
interested in gardening.

31:13.610 --> 31:17.136
Well, let's see
what we have here.

31:17.179 --> 31:18.528
Ah, what's this?

31:20.269 --> 31:21.096
Perfect.

31:22.271 --> 31:23.098
Goodnight.

31:31.672 --> 31:34.936
It's impossible to
sleep around here.

31:34.980 --> 31:36.851
No use, she can't hear.

31:36.895 --> 31:38.070
She out like a light.

31:38.113 --> 31:39.941
Why she had to snore like that?

31:39.985 --> 31:41.160
What do I do now?

31:41.203 --> 31:42.030
Whoa!

31:44.990 --> 31:46.730
You almost killed me.

31:48.167 --> 31:49.037
It's no use.

31:49.081 --> 31:50.473
What's this?

31:50.517 --> 31:51.910
I've seen better.

31:53.259 --> 31:54.086
I'm tired.

31:56.653 --> 31:59.178
Ooh, let's see what's out here.

32:06.315 --> 32:07.447
- Here we go.

32:19.067 --> 32:20.982
- What do you
think you're doing?

32:21.026 --> 32:24.855
You will never, never
be what you were before.

32:27.162 --> 32:29.773
Now, get out and get searching.

32:43.265 --> 32:46.181
- Okay, what if I
make it brighter?

32:48.053 --> 32:49.924
Oh no, rats!

32:49.968 --> 32:51.317
What have I done?

32:52.927 --> 32:54.276
Today is not your day, Ester.

32:54.320 --> 32:55.147
Go to bed.

32:56.713 --> 32:57.888
I'm exhausted.

32:59.281 --> 33:00.108
- Hello.

33:01.762 --> 33:02.589
Yoohoo!

33:03.633 --> 33:04.460
Hey, wait!

33:07.855 --> 33:08.943
- Goodnight, Lucas.

33:08.987 --> 33:10.031
Sweet dreams.

33:16.081 --> 33:17.996
- Whoa, that was close.

33:19.040 --> 33:19.867
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

33:19.910 --> 33:21.129
Hey, don't fall over.

33:21.173 --> 33:22.217
No, it's slippery,
it's slippery.

33:22.261 --> 33:23.436
Don't fall over,
don't fall over!

33:23.479 --> 33:24.480
I fell over.

33:27.353 --> 33:28.180
Wow.

33:31.922 --> 33:33.707
Well, it's nice
to meet you Lucas.

33:33.750 --> 33:35.143
Listen, I'm Tim.

33:35.187 --> 33:38.712
If you can come down
then I can, help me!

33:39.626 --> 33:42.281
Good doggy, good doggy.

33:42.324 --> 33:44.674
See how you like this one.

33:44.718 --> 33:46.459
Bull's eye!

33:46.502 --> 33:47.503
Outrageous.

33:50.115 --> 33:52.900
Hi there, did you
want something?

33:54.336 --> 33:55.598
Fetch it doggy!

33:57.992 --> 33:58.993
What a bozo!

34:00.951 --> 34:03.128
I take it all back.

34:03.171 --> 34:06.957
Let's see what you're
made of, here we go!

34:07.001 --> 34:09.351
Oh, c'mon, this is getting old.

34:09.395 --> 34:10.744
Have some magic!

34:13.007 --> 34:14.965
Here we go, here we go.

34:15.009 --> 34:15.922
Go on, go on, go on.

34:15.966 --> 34:17.185
Keep on going, keep on going.

34:17.228 --> 34:19.231
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon Tim!

34:20.754 --> 34:22.799
One more jump and you'll
be rid of the pooch.

34:22.842 --> 34:23.670
Here I go!

34:24.757 --> 34:26.411
Emergency landing.

34:26.455 --> 34:27.630
Teresa, Teresa!

34:27.674 --> 34:29.458
Open the window, open up!

34:30.981 --> 34:32.460
- Teresa, open up.

34:32.505 --> 34:33.723
The monster almost killed me?

34:34.637 --> 34:35.856
The guy from the fair?

34:35.899 --> 34:37.422
- No, your crazy mutt.

34:37.466 --> 34:40.208
I just wanted to look around
and suddenly, he was after me.

34:40.252 --> 34:42.688
- Calm down, you
probably scared him.

34:44.081 --> 34:45.605
Have you seen the
size of that mouth?

34:45.648 --> 34:48.347
He chased to that garden
full of enormous objects.

34:48.389 --> 34:49.217
What's going on?

34:49.261 --> 34:50.652
Teresa?

34:50.697 --> 34:52.786
- That's all we needed,
you woke up mom.

34:52.829 --> 34:53.656
- Quick.

34:55.005 --> 34:56.746
- Teresa, what's all
this noise about?

34:56.790 --> 34:57.878
And what happened
in the kitchen?

34:59.184 --> 35:00.750
It was
that mutt of yours.

35:00.794 --> 35:01.969
- It was Lucas, mom.

35:02.012 --> 35:03.666
He was trying to eat my elf.

35:04.711 --> 35:06.016
- Look.

35:09.846 --> 35:11.109
- C'mon, team.

35:11.152 --> 35:12.197
You can tell her.

35:12.240 --> 35:13.546
- Teresa, honey.

35:13.589 --> 35:15.200
This is no time for fairy tales.

35:15.243 --> 35:16.244
- It's true.

35:18.203 --> 35:20.857
Not that mutt again.

35:22.032 --> 35:24.078
- I told you, he
was chasing Tim.

35:24.122 --> 35:25.471
Tim, say something.

35:25.514 --> 35:26.820
- Go to bed and go to sleep.

35:26.863 --> 35:30.128
I'm going down to get
Lucas, is that clear?

35:32.086 --> 35:33.043
- Well that was nice Tim,

35:33.087 --> 35:34.784
you made me look like a liar.

35:36.134 --> 35:37.396
It's better if nobody
knows about me,

35:37.439 --> 35:39.049
not even your mom.

35:39.093 --> 35:40.355
I don't wanna repeat of
what happened to the fair.

35:40.399 --> 35:42.052
- But my mom will
never try to hurt you.

35:42.096 --> 35:43.619
- Yeah, yeah.

35:43.663 --> 35:46.970
But for the time being,
I prefer her not to know.

35:55.544 --> 35:57.720
- My goodness, Martin where
did you get that thing?

35:57.764 --> 36:00.201
- It's organic and humongous!

36:00.245 --> 36:01.768
- It was right there
in the greenhouse

36:01.811 --> 36:03.030
and it's not the only one.

36:03.073 --> 36:04.336
This morning, all my vegetables

36:04.379 --> 36:06.338
are suddenly way
bigger than normal.

36:06.381 --> 36:07.208
- Oh.

36:09.645 --> 36:11.125
It's incredible
how big it's grown.

36:11.169 --> 36:12.866
- It's almost like magic.

36:12.909 --> 36:15.347
- It that case, you
should ask Teresa's elf.

36:15.390 --> 36:16.522
What are you doing honey?

36:16.565 --> 36:17.610
- Sorry mom.
- She said she has one.

36:19.438 --> 36:20.526
- C'mon, Teresa, eat your toast,

36:20.569 --> 36:22.528
you're gonna be late for school.

36:22.571 --> 36:24.530
It was a restless
night for all of us.

36:24.573 --> 36:27.663
Something woke me up and I
found Lucas out in the garden.

36:27.707 --> 36:29.012
And he never does that.

36:29.056 --> 36:30.492
- I finished my toast, mom.

36:30.536 --> 36:32.233
I'll go get my backpack, okay?

36:32.277 --> 36:33.539
- And brush your teeth.

36:33.582 --> 36:36.019
Poor Lucas, didn't
you hear him barking?

36:36.063 --> 36:37.717
- Probably chasing a mole.

36:37.760 --> 36:41.416
They're popping up
everywhere at the moment.

36:44.463 --> 36:45.594
- It's me.

36:45.638 --> 36:47.770
I brought you something
for breakfast.

36:47.814 --> 36:49.424
- Great, I'm starving.

36:49.468 --> 36:50.295
- Here.

36:54.560 --> 36:55.691
- It's disgusting.

36:55.735 --> 36:57.084
- But it's perfectly fine.

36:57.127 --> 36:58.999
- I prefer the mud soup
we have in my world.

36:59.042 --> 37:00.740
- Mud, that's gross.

37:00.783 --> 37:02.742
Hey, wait, try this.

37:03.656 --> 37:05.658
- It's called chocolate.

37:09.052 --> 37:09.879
- Whoohoo!

37:13.361 --> 37:15.755
- That's tastes awesome!

37:15.798 --> 37:16.886
It's delicious!

37:16.930 --> 37:18.323
It's delicious!

37:20.847 --> 37:21.891
- I want more.

37:21.935 --> 37:22.718
More!

37:22.762 --> 37:23.589
Tons more!

37:23.632 --> 37:24.807
- No, stop that.

37:24.851 --> 37:26.331
The chocolate's making
you hyperactive.

37:26.374 --> 37:29.725
- I love to give some of this
to that footy duddy Todd.

37:29.769 --> 37:31.684
It's amazing.

37:31.727 --> 37:33.773
Chocolate!
- Hey stop.

37:33.816 --> 37:35.992
I wanna talk to you.

37:36.036 --> 37:37.167
- Chocolate!

37:37.211 --> 37:38.386
- Tim, please.

37:38.430 --> 37:39.648
- Chocolate.

37:39.692 --> 37:40.693
- No, listen.

37:41.694 --> 37:44.479
- I think that you were right.

37:44.523 --> 37:46.133
- Always am.

37:46.176 --> 37:48.048
- It's better if no
one knows you exist.

37:48.091 --> 37:50.703
Mom almost spilled the beans
to out neighbor, Martin.

37:50.746 --> 37:53.009
- Relax buddy, I got
it all under control.

37:53.053 --> 37:54.576
Nosy neighbors
are not a problem.

37:54.620 --> 37:56.578
I'm a smart elf.

37:56.622 --> 37:58.145
- Well, hope so.

37:58.188 --> 38:01.191
I couldn't stand it if
anybody tried to hurt you.

38:01.235 --> 38:02.671
- Don't worry about it.

38:02.715 --> 38:06.153
Now how about one
more little bite?

38:06.196 --> 38:10.026
- You know, you're my
best and my only friend.

38:11.245 --> 38:12.464
- Thanks.

38:12.507 --> 38:15.162
You know I've never had
a friend, only brothers.

38:15.205 --> 38:16.903
But it's really cool.

38:18.208 --> 38:21.255
- Yeah, you and I
have cool vibes.

38:22.648 --> 38:24.824
- Yes, mom told me
about it one time.

38:24.867 --> 38:27.827
If you have cool vibes, it
means if one of you is happy,

38:27.870 --> 38:29.959
the other one is too.

38:30.003 --> 38:31.613
And if one of you gets hurt,

38:31.657 --> 38:34.007
the other one feels it as well.

38:34.050 --> 38:37.140
- So in that case, if I
start pulling my own ears,

38:37.184 --> 38:40.187
would your ears hurt too?

38:40.230 --> 38:42.842
- No, it's just
like an expression.

38:42.885 --> 38:44.887
- Cool vibes, Teresa.

38:44.931 --> 38:45.801
- Cool vibes.

38:45.845 --> 38:49.065
♪ You and me

38:49.109 --> 38:50.328
♪ We got cool vibes

38:50.371 --> 38:53.026
♪ Me and you

38:53.069 --> 38:56.725
♪ I'm so happy that we met

38:56.769 --> 38:59.032
♪ We're different but it's true

38:59.075 --> 39:01.295
♪ Inside I'm just like you

39:01.339 --> 39:05.255
♪ And we'll be friends forever

39:06.518 --> 39:07.954
- No, no, no ,no!

39:09.172 --> 39:10.913
You're an elf killer.

39:22.621 --> 39:23.926
- Yes, gonna catch you!

39:23.970 --> 39:24.797
Gotcha!

39:27.713 --> 39:28.757
Take that!

39:28.801 --> 39:29.628
And that!

39:30.890 --> 39:31.717
- Hey, no!

39:49.822 --> 39:51.780
Cool vibes.

39:51.824 --> 39:54.217
Teresa, get moving,
you're late for school.

39:54.261 --> 39:55.044
- Time for school.

39:55.088 --> 39:56.959
I'm coming, mom!

39:57.003 --> 39:57.830
You coming?

39:58.744 --> 39:59.745
Sounds cool!

40:06.969 --> 40:08.971
I'm not gonna let you get away.

40:09.015 --> 40:10.320
Miserable imp.

40:10.364 --> 40:11.931
You can't be very far away.

40:11.974 --> 40:14.455
I'll catch you, you'll see.

40:14.499 --> 40:15.761
Have you found him?

40:15.804 --> 40:17.153
- No sign of him sir.

40:19.329 --> 40:20.983
He can't just have disappeared!

40:21.027 --> 40:23.116
- I looked all over
the fair ground, sir.

40:23.159 --> 40:24.160
- He can't.

40:24.204 --> 40:25.031
He can't vanish into thin air.

40:25.074 --> 40:26.336
- He's an elf, sir.

40:26.380 --> 40:30.166
An elf are creatures
that have magic powers.

40:30.210 --> 40:32.038
- Exactly, that's right.

40:32.081 --> 40:33.605
Magic powers.

40:34.693 --> 40:36.085
- To the library.

40:36.129 --> 40:38.871
- When did you take up reading.

40:38.914 --> 40:41.439
- Not just a coward, dumb too!

40:45.878 --> 40:48.315
These tiny little footprints.

41:01.589 --> 41:03.548
In that case, you
should ask Teresa's elf.

41:03.591 --> 41:04.505
- C'mon, Martin.

41:04.549 --> 41:07.247
There's no way that it's true.

41:07.290 --> 41:09.684
She said
she has an elf.

41:09.728 --> 41:11.817
- Well, this one's green.

41:12.992 --> 41:15.255
And this one, and this one.

41:16.648 --> 41:18.388
Tim, what do you
think of my teacher?

41:18.432 --> 41:19.825
- Wow, incredible.

41:20.913 --> 41:22.392
- Todd would be freaking out!

41:23.393 --> 41:24.307
Hey!

41:24.351 --> 41:26.571
I'm talking about my teacher.

41:26.614 --> 41:27.572
- Pain in the neck.

41:27.615 --> 41:29.791
The way she was droning on.

41:29.835 --> 41:31.097
You can keep her.

41:31.140 --> 41:34.404
- If she heard you,
you'd be in trouble.

41:34.448 --> 41:35.667
All done.

41:35.710 --> 41:36.624
- At last, what
are we gonna play?

41:36.668 --> 41:38.321
- I don't know, we could.

41:45.328 --> 41:48.244
- Oh, Martin, quick, Tim.

41:48.288 --> 41:49.855
What are you doing?

41:49.898 --> 41:51.073
Hey, get out of my face.

41:51.117 --> 41:51.944
- Be quiet.

41:51.987 --> 41:52.814
get her off me.

41:52.858 --> 41:53.641
- Leave this to me.

41:53.685 --> 41:55.121
And now.

41:55.164 --> 41:56.557
- Cut that out.

41:56.601 --> 41:59.386
Are you out of your mind?

41:59.429 --> 42:01.562
- Martin, this is serious.

42:08.874 --> 42:11.616
- It should be here somewhere.

42:11.659 --> 42:13.356
D, D, D, E, at last!

42:14.619 --> 42:19.058
- E, E, E, E, E, ah,
elves, a field guide.

42:19.101 --> 42:21.408
That's the one, here it is.

42:22.627 --> 42:24.019
I saw it first.

42:24.063 --> 42:25.717
- That book is mine!

42:26.935 --> 42:27.936
Martin?

42:27.980 --> 42:29.503
- I don't believe it.

42:29.547 --> 42:30.591
Vladimir.

42:30.635 --> 42:32.637
My dear old friend Vladimir.

42:32.680 --> 42:34.900
- The very same,
what a surprise, huh?

42:34.943 --> 42:35.901
- You could say that again.

42:35.944 --> 42:37.816
What are you doing around here?

42:37.859 --> 42:39.295
- I work at the
work at the fair.

42:39.339 --> 42:40.993
- What a coincidence.

42:41.036 --> 42:42.560
I have a vegetable stall.

42:42.603 --> 42:44.126
- Interesting.

42:44.170 --> 42:45.127
That's my book.

42:45.171 --> 42:47.173
- We'll see about that.

42:47.216 --> 42:50.393
- You're not gonna
get your own way.

42:50.437 --> 42:52.831
You melee scoundrel,
give me back my book.

42:52.874 --> 42:55.181
- So nice to see you again.

42:58.619 --> 43:00.534
- C'mon, put that down,
we've got work to do.

43:00.578 --> 43:02.405
- Your telling me, these
guys are on their last legs.

43:02.449 --> 43:03.581
- Miserable rat.

43:03.624 --> 43:04.886
Are you deaf or something?

43:04.930 --> 43:07.193
Go into town while I
look around the fair.

43:07.236 --> 43:08.934
My book was stolen
from my hands.

43:09.935 --> 43:11.458
- The field guide to elves.

43:11.501 --> 43:14.243
We need it we're gonna
catch that little pest.

43:14.287 --> 43:15.505
- And who are we
looking for, sir?

43:15.549 --> 43:17.420
- A guy who sells vegetables.

43:17.464 --> 43:19.118
We knew each other
back in school,

43:19.161 --> 43:20.641
we that elf together.

43:20.685 --> 43:22.861
I'm convinced it
was him who took it

43:22.904 --> 43:25.080
and left that
plant in its place.

43:25.124 --> 43:26.342
- No doubt.

43:26.386 --> 43:27.953
And if he's interested
in that book now.

43:27.996 --> 43:32.174
- It must be because he
found that pestiferous elf.

43:34.394 --> 43:35.264
Get moving!

43:40.705 --> 43:42.315
- No one over here.

43:42.358 --> 43:43.838
No one over there.

43:46.754 --> 43:47.842
Oh, I'm so sorry.

43:47.886 --> 43:49.670
Are you hurt?

43:51.803 --> 43:53.369
- Hey are you the.

43:53.413 --> 43:55.284
- Hey it's the
guy from the fair.

43:55.328 --> 43:56.677
- We have to run.

43:56.721 --> 43:58.636
- Little girl, don't go.

43:58.679 --> 43:59.811
- Leave us alone.

43:59.854 --> 44:01.160
Faster!

44:01.203 --> 44:02.074
He's chasing us.

44:02.117 --> 44:04.163
- Little girl!

44:04.206 --> 44:05.251
Can I borrow that a second?

44:05.294 --> 44:06.295
- No way, dude.

44:07.862 --> 44:09.647
- My bike, mom!

44:09.690 --> 44:10.560
- No need to yell.

44:10.604 --> 44:11.518
I'll bring it back.

44:11.561 --> 44:13.999
- Mommy, that man stole my bike.

44:14.042 --> 44:16.523
Out of the
way, out of the way!

44:16.566 --> 44:17.480
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

44:17.524 --> 44:18.960
- Hey, watch where you're going!

44:19.004 --> 44:21.180
- That little bike's ridiculous.

44:21.223 --> 44:23.486
- It's green, c'mon, c'mon.

44:25.227 --> 44:26.054
No don't change.

44:26.098 --> 44:27.273
No, no, no!

44:27.316 --> 44:28.100
I'm gonna get run over.

44:28.143 --> 44:29.057
What are you doing?

44:29.101 --> 44:30.798
- I'm sorry, I'm in a hurry.

44:30.842 --> 44:33.192
No, no, look out!

44:36.238 --> 44:37.196
Over there.

44:37.239 --> 44:38.676
- Hey look, the skate park.

44:38.719 --> 44:41.026
This is starting
to get interesting.

44:41.069 --> 44:42.723
Give it all you got.

44:45.595 --> 44:46.771
- There he is.

44:46.814 --> 44:48.294
He's persistent,
I'll give him that.

44:48.337 --> 44:50.078
- C'mon, stupid bike.

44:51.340 --> 44:53.473
Little girl, where are you?

44:53.516 --> 44:55.301
Hey, over here, loser!

44:55.344 --> 44:56.258
- Be quiet.

45:03.091 --> 45:04.658
- Please, little girl.

45:04.702 --> 45:07.530
I just wanna have
a word with you.

45:13.275 --> 45:17.236
- There's only one
thing this could mean.

45:17.279 --> 45:19.194
Lucas, is Teresa home?

45:19.238 --> 45:21.153
I need to have a
serious talk to her.

45:21.196 --> 45:23.285
C'mon let's go find her.

45:23.329 --> 45:24.765
C'mon, Lucas.

45:24.809 --> 45:25.679
Let's go.

45:31.816 --> 45:34.993
C'mon,
you're doing great.

45:35.036 --> 45:36.690
- Keep it up, Sam.

45:36.734 --> 45:37.996
You can do this.

45:38.039 --> 45:38.866
That guy is so annoying.

45:38.910 --> 45:40.172
- Oh, no!

45:40.215 --> 45:42.435
Hey, why
are you stopping?

45:42.478 --> 45:44.567
- We can't we're not
allowed to cross.

45:44.611 --> 45:45.438
Look!

45:46.831 --> 45:48.397
- Give me a break, pal.

45:48.441 --> 45:51.052
We either cross right this
second or he'll catch us.

45:51.096 --> 45:51.923
C'mon.

45:52.967 --> 45:54.142
- Little girl.

45:55.970 --> 45:57.406
- Okay, here we go.

45:57.450 --> 45:58.843
one jump.

46:02.847 --> 46:03.935
- That was awesome.

46:03.978 --> 46:05.197
Totally incredible.

46:05.240 --> 46:06.241
Magical.

46:06.285 --> 46:08.069
- As an elf, I agree.

46:11.333 --> 46:12.813
- I can't.

46:12.857 --> 46:15.163
Are you brave
enough to follow us?

46:15.207 --> 46:16.556
Chicken!

46:16.599 --> 46:18.210
Scaredy cat!

46:18.253 --> 46:19.689
C'mon, forget it.

46:19.733 --> 46:21.604
We could get in trouble for that

46:21.648 --> 46:23.084
if mom finds out.

46:28.307 --> 46:30.091
You're
nothing but a coward.

46:30.135 --> 46:32.485
You'll never be what
you we're before.

46:32.528 --> 46:34.879
Get that into your head.

46:34.922 --> 46:37.403
- Are you sure you
haven't new fiends at all

46:37.446 --> 46:39.361
over the last few days?

46:39.405 --> 46:40.667
- I already told you I haven't.

46:40.710 --> 46:41.973
- I have to go do
my homework now.

46:42.016 --> 46:42.843
I'm sorry.

46:42.887 --> 46:44.540
- Hold on a second.

46:44.584 --> 46:47.717
I wanna show you
something before you go.

46:47.761 --> 46:49.981
Have you ever heard of
the springtime elves?

46:50.024 --> 46:52.200
- There's no such
thing as elves.

46:52.244 --> 46:54.637
- That's not what
this book says.

46:54.681 --> 46:56.248
- Oh, okay then.

46:56.291 --> 46:58.293
- You know, I once saw one.

46:58.337 --> 46:59.120
You did.

46:59.164 --> 47:00.556
- But it didn't survive.

47:00.600 --> 47:01.906
Look.

47:01.949 --> 47:04.734
The elves that come
here in the spring

47:04.778 --> 47:09.304
can only remain in this world
for the duration that time.

47:10.305 --> 47:12.046
- Until the end of spring.

47:12.090 --> 47:14.092
Look what it says right here.

47:14.135 --> 47:17.660
It is they who make the
flowers bloom in our world,

47:17.704 --> 47:19.880
but once their work is done,

47:19.924 --> 47:21.969
thy must return to their own

47:22.013 --> 47:25.930
through this ancient holly oak
tree or they run the risk--

47:27.235 --> 47:30.108
- Of turning into
plants forevermore.

47:30.151 --> 47:33.676
- Huh, c'mon, that
just a lot of nonsense.

47:40.770 --> 47:43.121
- You're little friend
is in danger twice over.

47:43.164 --> 47:45.253
Spring time is about
to come to an end

47:45.297 --> 47:47.429
and I'm worried that
an acquaintance of
mine from the fair

47:47.473 --> 47:48.735
is out to get him.

47:48.778 --> 47:50.302
- We'll I don't know
anybody from the fair.

47:50.345 --> 47:53.348
- This guy can do
him a lot of harm.

47:55.263 --> 47:56.699
- Okay, alright then.

47:56.743 --> 47:58.397
- Teresa, dinner.

47:58.440 --> 47:59.920
Hi Martin, everything okay?

47:59.964 --> 48:01.791
- Fine and dandy.

48:01.835 --> 48:03.271
- Coming mom.

48:03.315 --> 48:06.144
I have to go now, I'm sorry.

48:06.187 --> 48:08.755
- Are you telling you
couldn't take that elf

48:08.798 --> 48:10.844
from a puny little girl?

48:10.888 --> 48:13.238
- You see, I was
just about to do it

48:13.281 --> 48:14.587
but, I'm sorry.

48:15.805 --> 48:17.720
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

48:17.764 --> 48:18.591
Excuses!

48:20.071 --> 48:21.289
Scram!

48:21.333 --> 48:22.987
Get out of my sight.

48:25.250 --> 48:29.428
- The girl and the elf seem
to be really good friends.

48:36.957 --> 48:38.872
Teresa,
what Martin said.

48:40.352 --> 48:42.484
It just his own
story, ignore it.

48:43.529 --> 48:44.660
- Well, it's not.

48:44.704 --> 48:46.967
Martin could be wrong.

48:47.011 --> 48:49.056
- Don't enter their world
because all who have done so

48:49.100 --> 48:50.449
have never come back.

48:50.492 --> 48:52.190
That's what my
brother elves told me.

48:52.233 --> 48:53.669
What if i turn into a plant?

48:53.713 --> 48:54.975
- Shut up!

48:55.019 --> 48:57.021
You just wanna go
away, don't you?

48:57.064 --> 48:57.978
- No, but.

48:59.588 --> 49:01.155
You're missing your boring
brother and wanna go see him.

49:01.199 --> 49:02.026
Admit it.

49:03.592 --> 49:04.985
- No, it's not that.

49:05.029 --> 49:06.117
Look at this.

49:08.510 --> 49:10.338
- That's, oh, that's nothing.

49:10.382 --> 49:12.906
Come here, I'll get rid of it.

49:14.342 --> 49:16.127
- That really hurts!

49:16.170 --> 49:17.432
I think I better go.

49:17.476 --> 49:19.608
- No, you can't go away.

49:19.652 --> 49:21.915
I don't wanna be on my own.

49:23.873 --> 49:27.138
- You see, spring will
be over in a few hours.

49:27.181 --> 49:28.704
I don't wanna be a plant.

49:28.748 --> 49:30.837
- But Tim, I can take
care if you, honestly.

49:30.880 --> 49:32.795
I won't let anything
happen to you.

49:32.839 --> 49:34.536
- When one of you gets hurt,

49:34.580 --> 49:36.930
the other feels
it too, remember?

49:39.237 --> 49:42.109
- If I stay, you're
going to suffer too.

49:42.153 --> 49:44.590
- Alright, if you
wanna go, just go!

49:44.633 --> 49:46.113
I don't need you around anyway.

49:46.157 --> 49:47.897
- Don't get mad.

49:47.941 --> 49:48.768
Listen.

49:48.811 --> 49:49.769
- I don't want to.

49:49.812 --> 49:52.119
Go away and never come back.

49:52.163 --> 49:53.338
- There he is.

50:08.266 --> 50:09.093
- Tim.

50:10.137 --> 50:11.617
Tim!

50:11.660 --> 50:13.053
Tim, wait for me!

50:14.968 --> 50:15.751
- Yeah.

50:15.795 --> 50:17.057
- Tim, I'm sorry.

50:17.101 --> 50:18.276
Please forgive me.

50:18.319 --> 50:20.974
What I said isn't true.

50:21.018 --> 50:23.672
Your my best friend
and I love you so much.

50:23.716 --> 50:26.023
- Oh don't be silly, I know.

50:26.066 --> 50:27.981
- Let me help you
look for the oak tree.

50:28.025 --> 50:28.851
Look out!

50:30.331 --> 50:31.376
Tim?

50:31.419 --> 50:32.246
No!

50:36.337 --> 50:38.905
- Let's give it a try.

50:38.948 --> 50:39.819
- Mom, mom!

50:39.862 --> 50:40.776
You have to help me.

50:41.690 --> 50:42.517
- They caught Tim.

50:43.562 --> 50:44.780
- My elf, they took him away.

50:44.824 --> 50:47.000
- Oh honey, you had
me worried there.

50:47.044 --> 50:48.567
- But mom, please, it's true.

50:48.610 --> 50:49.655
He's been kidnapped.

50:49.698 --> 50:50.699
- Listen, Teresa.

50:50.743 --> 50:52.005
I have a photo session booked

50:52.049 --> 50:53.833
and I have to leave John
with your auntie first.

50:53.876 --> 50:55.139
- You have to believe me, mom.

50:55.182 --> 50:56.053
I need you.

50:56.096 --> 50:57.228
- Up we go.

50:57.271 --> 50:58.794
Just calm down, okay?

50:58.838 --> 51:00.448
Why don't you watch TV
and when I get back,

51:00.492 --> 51:01.797
we can discuss this.

51:01.841 --> 51:03.190
- If I don't help him,
he'll turn into a plant,

51:03.234 --> 51:04.322
don't you see?

51:04.365 --> 51:05.584
And I don't want him to.

51:05.627 --> 51:06.498
- Now, look.

51:06.541 --> 51:07.760
As soon as I get back,

51:07.803 --> 51:11.459
I'll help you find
your little elf, okay?

51:11.503 --> 51:13.113
If you need anything,
Martin's at home.

51:13.157 --> 51:14.941
He knows you're here.

51:14.984 --> 51:15.811
- Martin.

51:17.813 --> 51:18.640
Martin.

51:20.816 --> 51:21.643
Martin.

51:22.862 --> 51:24.255
Martin, Martin, you
have to help me.

51:24.298 --> 51:25.821
- What's up, did your
mom leave already?

51:25.865 --> 51:27.693
- You were right, that
man took him away.

51:27.736 --> 51:29.086
He kidnapped him.

51:29.129 --> 51:30.391
- Yes.

51:30.435 --> 51:31.697
- Okay, don't panic.

51:31.740 --> 51:33.133
Have you talked to
your mom about this?

51:33.177 --> 51:35.309
- No, and I don't
want her to know.

51:35.353 --> 51:37.746
I should've have listened to
you right from the beginning.

51:37.790 --> 51:39.139
- Now, don't worry,
we'll go to the fair

51:39.183 --> 51:40.184
and I'll talk to him.

51:40.227 --> 51:42.099
Let's go.
- Yes please.

51:47.365 --> 51:48.279
Here we are.

51:48.322 --> 51:50.281
Let's hope we're in luck.

51:50.324 --> 51:51.586
- Tim, Tim!

51:51.630 --> 51:52.892
Where are you, Tim?

51:52.935 --> 51:54.023
Can you hear me?

51:54.067 --> 51:55.286
- Teresa, hold on.

51:55.329 --> 51:56.983
I think we got
here a little late.

51:57.897 --> 51:59.377
We have to get inside.

51:59.420 --> 52:01.509
- I'm sorry, but until tomorrow,
there's nothing we can do.

52:01.553 --> 52:03.859
- But you work
here, use your keys.

52:03.903 --> 52:05.122
- I only have the stall.

52:05.165 --> 52:06.645
I don't have the keys
for the main gate.

52:06.688 --> 52:11.389
- But we can't leave Tim
stuck in there all night long.

52:11.432 --> 52:12.477
- Teresa, wait.

52:12.520 --> 52:13.652
We can come back tomorrow.

52:13.695 --> 52:14.522
- That's no good.

52:14.566 --> 52:15.654
Tomorrow's too late.

52:15.697 --> 52:16.481
- Listen to me, please.
- By tomorrow,

52:16.524 --> 52:17.482
Tim will be a plant.

52:17.525 --> 52:19.223
Springtime's almost over.

52:24.097 --> 52:24.924
Put me down!

52:26.360 --> 52:27.579
- Sorry, sir.

52:27.622 --> 52:28.884
She's been acting a little wild.

52:28.928 --> 52:30.886
We were just leaving.

52:33.237 --> 52:35.239
Keep it down.

52:41.375 --> 52:43.203
- You're not going
to escape again.

52:43.247 --> 52:45.118
I'll be watching
you day and night.

52:45.162 --> 52:48.382
Oh yeah, just you wait till
my brothers come and get me.

52:48.426 --> 52:50.341
- Brothers, did
you say brothers?

52:53.909 --> 52:55.563
It's even better
than I've imagined.

52:57.913 --> 52:59.654
- Instead of one,
I'm going to have

52:59.698 --> 53:02.396
a whole troop of little elves.

53:02.440 --> 53:04.442
We're going to have to
buy a much bigger wagon

53:04.485 --> 53:05.573
to keep them in

53:05.617 --> 53:06.444
with lots of cage.

53:06.487 --> 53:07.749
- It's crazy.

53:07.793 --> 53:11.231
- And you are going
to help me catch them.

53:13.712 --> 53:14.887
- Tim, higher!

53:21.415 --> 53:22.938
Look.

53:28.422 --> 53:30.163
And another one here.

53:34.515 --> 53:35.429
Hey, c'mon.

53:36.561 --> 53:38.084
Keep it up and go!

53:39.346 --> 53:40.608
Bam!

53:42.828 --> 53:44.177
This is so cool!

53:58.757 --> 53:59.932
- Hey, give that back to me.

53:59.975 --> 54:01.629
- Hey, everyone,
Teresa's got a boyfiend.

54:01.673 --> 54:02.543
She's got a mini boyfriend.

54:02.587 --> 54:03.936
- I'll show you.

54:05.546 --> 54:08.245
- Miss, miss, Teresa
and Marcus are fighting.

54:08.288 --> 54:10.203
- Children, stop that at once.

54:10.247 --> 54:11.465
That will do.

54:11.509 --> 54:12.466
- She was that one
started it, Miss.

54:12.510 --> 54:13.337
- That's not true, it was him.

54:13.380 --> 54:14.468
He took my drawing.

54:14.512 --> 54:15.600
- I did not take it off her.

54:15.643 --> 54:16.470
I just wanted to see it.

54:16.514 --> 54:17.428
She started to hit me.

54:17.471 --> 54:18.385
- You liar!

54:18.429 --> 54:19.908
- That's enough.

54:19.952 --> 54:21.214
I will not tolerate
fighting in my classroom.

54:21.258 --> 54:23.085
Is that clear?

54:23.129 --> 54:26.219
Now, where is that drawing?

54:26.263 --> 54:27.612
I want you to understand

54:27.655 --> 54:28.917
that what you've
done is very serious.

54:28.961 --> 54:30.179
I'm gonna call your parents

54:30.223 --> 54:31.442
to tell them exactly
what happened.

54:32.747 --> 54:34.140
- Did I ask you a
question, Lucia?

54:34.183 --> 54:36.316
Everybody get back
to their seats.

54:36.360 --> 54:39.363
You two will stay behind
till the end of school.

54:39.406 --> 54:41.495
An imaginary friend perhaps.

54:41.539 --> 54:42.366
- Maybe.

54:42.409 --> 54:43.976
Over the last few days,

54:44.019 --> 54:45.194
she's been talking a lot
about her friend, the elf.

54:45.238 --> 54:47.327
- Yeah, that's right.

54:47.371 --> 54:48.546
- The last time she mentioned it

54:48.589 --> 54:50.069
was yesterday afternoon.

54:50.112 --> 54:51.636
She ask me to help
because according to her,

54:51.679 --> 54:53.594
he'd been kidnapped.

54:53.638 --> 54:55.248
She's just a girl.

54:55.292 --> 54:57.206
I didn't wanna make too much
of it but this thing today,

54:57.250 --> 54:59.339
but this does worry me a lot.

54:59.383 --> 55:00.209
- Sure.

55:01.428 --> 55:03.387
Teresa is always been
an intelligent girl.

55:03.430 --> 55:05.214
She's interested in everything

55:05.258 --> 55:07.260
but she's also very imaginative.

55:07.304 --> 55:08.827
- John.

55:08.870 --> 55:09.784
It's true.

55:09.828 --> 55:11.569
- Maybe that's what she wants.

55:11.612 --> 55:13.832
For you to give her a
little bit more attention.

55:13.875 --> 55:15.094
That's all.

55:15.137 --> 55:17.705
- No John, I'm not going
to give you the keys.

55:17.749 --> 55:21.187
Okay then, I'll do my best
to spend more time with her.

55:21.230 --> 55:25.191
As soon as we get back
home, we'll have a talk.

55:26.627 --> 55:28.890
- So your mom gave you
permission to come here?

55:28.934 --> 55:29.761
- Yeah.

55:29.804 --> 55:31.284
C'mon, I hope he's okay.

55:31.328 --> 55:32.546
Those men really scare me.

55:32.590 --> 55:33.808
Especially the big one.

55:33.852 --> 55:37.116
You'll see what I
mean when you see him.

55:40.815 --> 55:43.209
There's no one here.

55:43.252 --> 55:44.602
- Oh, little girl.

55:44.645 --> 55:45.559
What are you doing here?

55:45.603 --> 55:47.213
- Good afternoon, Vladimir.

55:49.476 --> 55:51.130
- You know the reason
why we're here.

55:51.173 --> 55:52.958
- Let Tim go, right this minute.

55:53.001 --> 55:54.263
- Get off, brat!
- Teresa!

55:54.307 --> 55:56.004
Hey, back off you big bully.

55:56.048 --> 55:56.918
Are you alright, Teresa?

55:56.962 --> 55:59.051
- Yeah, he's getting away!

56:00.705 --> 56:04.361
- Teresa, I've been
talking with your teacher.

56:04.404 --> 56:05.274
Hey, Lucas.

56:06.667 --> 56:09.322
Uh-uh Lucas, not
Teresa's drawing.

56:09.366 --> 56:13.413
Teresa, come down here,
I wanna talk to you.

56:13.457 --> 56:14.283
Teresa?

56:16.547 --> 56:18.113
- Out of the way, you fool.

56:18.157 --> 56:19.332
- There he is.

56:21.639 --> 56:22.466
C'mon.

56:25.860 --> 56:27.122
- Hide me.

56:27.166 --> 56:28.341
Get out of my stall.

56:28.385 --> 56:29.342
- Quick!
- He's a thief.

56:30.387 --> 56:32.171
That's all in need to hear.

56:32.214 --> 56:33.215
- Get your hands off me.

56:33.259 --> 56:34.086
You don't know who I am.

56:34.129 --> 56:36.131
- Get out of here!

56:36.175 --> 56:37.611
- Give me that.

56:37.655 --> 56:39.134
Get back!

56:39.178 --> 56:41.310
You're not going to steal
another elf from me.

56:41.354 --> 56:42.573
- You madman.

56:42.616 --> 56:44.879
Put that down and tell
us where to find Tim.

56:44.923 --> 56:46.620
- You won't stop me, Martin.

56:46.664 --> 56:47.578
- Look out!

56:56.500 --> 56:58.893
- How could you have
fallen so low, Sam?

56:58.937 --> 57:01.330
- Hey dude, quit feeling
sorry for yourself

57:01.374 --> 57:02.767
and help me out.

57:02.810 --> 57:05.422
- The great Sam can't do
anything for anyone these days.

57:05.465 --> 57:06.684
I'm so sorry.

57:06.727 --> 57:09.208
- Don't be a cry baby
and help me, please.

57:09.251 --> 57:10.557
- I'm completely useless.

57:10.601 --> 57:11.515
- Here we go again.

57:11.558 --> 57:13.038
- If only I could grow a spine

57:13.081 --> 57:15.170
and stand up to
that horrible man.

57:15.214 --> 57:16.824
- I'm gonna be growing branches

57:16.868 --> 57:19.871
if you don't get me outta here.

57:19.914 --> 57:21.046
Wake up!

57:21.089 --> 57:22.177
Do something!

57:24.397 --> 57:25.746
- What's the
problem, mister elf?

57:25.790 --> 57:27.835
Don't you know
it's rude to shout?

57:27.879 --> 57:29.054
- What do you expect me to do

57:29.097 --> 57:30.577
if you're behaving like a child.

57:30.621 --> 57:31.883
Can't you see me?

57:31.926 --> 57:33.493
Look at me.

57:35.060 --> 57:36.583
I'm turning
into a plant.

57:36.627 --> 57:38.106
- This can't be true.

57:38.150 --> 57:39.238
- Oh yes, it can.

57:39.281 --> 57:40.587
Just get me out of here.

57:40.631 --> 57:43.416
I'm running out of strength.

57:43.460 --> 57:46.071
- Get up, we have
to get outta here.

57:46.114 --> 57:46.985
- Sir.

57:47.028 --> 57:48.552
- Come on, come on.

57:48.595 --> 57:50.945
That vexatious vegetable seller
wants to steal our property.

57:50.989 --> 57:52.947
- I think you should
let the elf go, sir.

57:54.993 --> 57:56.473
Go on, do something.

57:56.516 --> 57:57.735
- I want you to let he elf go.

57:57.778 --> 57:59.693
- That's it, that's
what I'm talking about.

57:59.737 --> 58:00.955
- Please.

58:00.999 --> 58:02.087
- You little traitor.

58:02.130 --> 58:04.785
Who do you think you are anyway?

58:06.483 --> 58:07.919
He's mine, all mine!

58:07.962 --> 58:09.877
Hey, listen, he's
heading to the tent over there.

58:09.921 --> 58:11.531
- Thank you.
- No, you can't trust him.

58:11.575 --> 58:12.663
That's his buddy, I know him.

58:12.706 --> 58:13.968
- It's true.

58:14.012 --> 58:14.665
I can see why you
wouldn't trust me.

58:14.708 --> 58:15.666
- Come on.

58:15.709 --> 58:17.276
- But I want to help you.

58:17.319 --> 58:20.279
I don't want that man to cause
any more harm to anyone else.

58:20.322 --> 58:21.759
- Sounds like he means it.

58:21.802 --> 58:23.674
- That poor little elf
doesn't have much time left.

58:23.717 --> 58:25.719
Please guys, we
have to move fast.

58:25.763 --> 58:27.025
- I know.

58:27.068 --> 58:29.418
- Alright, let's get moving.

58:39.341 --> 58:40.168
Teresa!

58:44.129 --> 58:46.697
A big hand for
the brothers Excel and Harry.

58:46.740 --> 58:48.525
We hoped you enjoyed the show

58:48.568 --> 58:49.917
and we bid you all farewell.

58:49.961 --> 58:53.704
Until our next performance
tomorrow evening!

58:53.747 --> 58:55.140
- He's up there.

58:55.183 --> 58:57.403
- No one's gonna
take what's mine.

58:58.926 --> 59:00.580
One moment,
ladies and gentlemen.

59:00.624 --> 59:02.582
It seems we have one final act.

59:02.626 --> 59:03.757
Be careful,
it's dangerous.

59:03.801 --> 59:06.804
- I'll show you, loudmouth.

59:06.847 --> 59:08.196
Martin,
are you alright?

59:11.504 --> 59:12.331
- Whoa!

59:12.374 --> 59:13.898
- Look out!

59:13.941 --> 59:16.596
A perfect
one, ladies and gentlemen!

59:16.640 --> 59:18.293
- That man's crazy!

59:19.207 --> 59:20.992
And there's more!

59:21.035 --> 59:22.602
- Hey, look up there.

59:22.646 --> 59:23.472
It's Sam!

59:24.996 --> 59:28.173
Oh please, you would
have to help Tim.

59:34.832 --> 59:36.311
- Treacherous rat!

59:36.355 --> 59:37.530
Just you wait!

59:38.923 --> 59:42.143
- Watch out Sam, the cannon.

59:42.187 --> 59:43.667
Whoa!

59:45.277 --> 59:46.191
- Atta boy!

59:47.105 --> 59:48.759
Gotcha!

59:48.802 --> 59:50.021
- The great Samuel,

59:50.064 --> 59:52.371
I expected nothing less
from you, my fiend.

59:53.677 --> 59:54.852
- Bravo!
 My goodness!

59:54.895 --> 59:57.594
That has to be
that great Samuel.

59:57.637 --> 01:00:00.509
One of the greatest
trapeze artist in history.

01:00:00.553 --> 01:00:03.512
- Thank you, thank you everyone.

01:00:03.556 --> 01:00:04.862
Look out!

01:00:04.905 --> 01:00:06.907
Watch and learn.

01:00:10.650 --> 01:00:13.000
- That will do, just surrender!

01:00:13.044 --> 01:00:14.306
- Never!

01:00:14.349 --> 01:00:15.568
- Let's finish this
once and for all.

01:00:15.612 --> 01:00:16.613
- It's okay Martin.

01:00:16.656 --> 01:00:17.614
I've got this.

01:00:17.657 --> 01:00:19.398
- Ow, that hurts!

01:00:19.441 --> 01:00:20.268
- Sorry.

01:00:21.661 --> 01:00:22.880
- Au revoir, my friends.

01:00:22.923 --> 01:00:24.229
- Not a chance.

01:00:24.272 --> 01:00:25.099
Here, little girl.

01:00:25.143 --> 01:00:25.970
- Tim.

01:00:26.013 --> 01:00:27.275
- Sam, I order you to--

01:00:27.319 --> 01:00:28.712
- I'm not taking any
more orders from you.

01:00:30.061 --> 01:00:31.584
After everything
I've done for you.

01:00:31.628 --> 01:00:33.151
- That only thing you ever
did was to ruin my life.

01:00:33.194 --> 01:00:34.848
But that's over now.

01:00:37.982 --> 01:00:40.593
- Tim, say something.

01:00:40.637 --> 01:00:41.681
- Get me out of here!

01:00:41.725 --> 01:00:43.683
- Happy to oblige, sir.

01:00:43.727 --> 01:00:46.120
- No, no, you're not going to.

01:00:46.164 --> 01:00:46.904
Whoa!

01:00:48.296 --> 01:00:50.385
Congratulations my friend.

01:00:50.429 --> 01:00:52.431
A truly original act.

01:00:52.474 --> 01:00:54.738
Quick, let's go.

01:00:54.781 --> 01:00:56.696
- Tim, please, hang
on a little longer.

01:00:56.740 --> 01:00:58.219
Just a little longer, okay?

01:00:58.263 --> 01:00:59.786
- C'mon, we have to act fast.

01:00:59.830 --> 01:01:01.222
- I'm sorry, Tim.

01:01:01.266 --> 01:01:02.528
You were right.

01:01:02.571 --> 01:01:04.835
- C'mon Teresa, we don't
have time to be sad.

01:01:04.878 --> 01:01:06.140
- You guys go ahead.

01:01:06.184 --> 01:01:07.751
There's one more thing
I have to do first.

01:01:07.794 --> 01:01:09.796
- Okay, let's go.

01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:14.018
- Martin isn't around
either and his phone is off.

01:01:14.061 --> 01:01:15.410
What is it boy?

01:01:15.454 --> 01:01:16.934
You know something, right?

01:01:16.977 --> 01:01:18.718
Okay, take us to her.

01:01:25.116 --> 01:01:26.334
Whoa!

01:01:26.378 --> 01:01:28.075
- Faster, faster!

01:01:28.119 --> 01:01:30.469
What's over there, look out!

01:01:34.299 --> 01:01:35.387
- At least I'm in one piece.

01:01:35.430 --> 01:01:36.867
Come on, let's get outta here.

01:01:36.910 --> 01:01:39.347
Tim, are you okay Tim?

01:01:39.391 --> 01:01:40.740
Tim, listen.

01:01:40.784 --> 01:01:43.134
We're gonna make it, okay?

01:01:43.177 --> 01:01:45.092
- Oh no, it's a wreck.

01:01:45.136 --> 01:01:46.311
And
now what do we do?

01:01:46.354 --> 01:01:47.355
- We'll carry on on our foot.

01:01:47.399 --> 01:01:48.792
It can't be too far from here.

01:01:48.835 --> 01:01:49.662
Come on!

01:01:51.751 --> 01:01:52.665
- Let's go.

01:01:57.235 --> 01:01:58.149
There it is!

01:01:58.192 --> 01:01:59.628
That's the holly oak tree.

01:01:59.672 --> 01:02:00.934
- At last, come on.

01:02:00.978 --> 01:02:05.069
Spring is just about
to come to an end.

01:02:08.028 --> 01:02:10.639
Tim, what if we
got here too late?

01:02:10.683 --> 01:02:11.728
Tim, wake up.

01:02:13.468 --> 01:02:14.774
Can you hear me?

01:02:14.818 --> 01:02:16.602
We made it to the holly oak.

01:02:16.645 --> 01:02:17.472
Tim.

01:02:17.516 --> 01:02:18.604
- I'm sorry, Teresa.

01:02:18.647 --> 01:02:21.346
- No, it can't happen.

01:02:21.389 --> 01:02:22.695
Don't die.

01:02:22.739 --> 01:02:24.088
Tim.

01:02:24.131 --> 01:02:25.654
Tim.

01:02:25.698 --> 01:02:26.873
- Teresa, look!

01:02:28.919 --> 01:02:29.746
- Wow.

01:02:30.747 --> 01:02:32.400
- Tim, this can't be true.

01:02:32.444 --> 01:02:34.098
What's the human
world done to you?

01:02:35.055 --> 01:02:35.882
Are you Todd?

01:02:35.926 --> 01:02:37.492
- Yes, yes.

01:02:37.536 --> 01:02:39.538
Now, quick, lay him on the
ground right here, come on!

01:02:39.581 --> 01:02:40.844
- Please help him.

01:02:40.887 --> 01:02:42.236
It was all my fault.

01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:46.545
He wanted to come
back but I, I'm sorry.

01:02:46.588 --> 01:02:48.199
Will that make him better?

01:02:48.242 --> 01:02:49.243
- I hope so.

01:02:50.592 --> 01:02:52.594
Hang in there, brother.

01:02:52.638 --> 01:02:55.249
Without you, everything's
dull and boring.

01:02:55.293 --> 01:02:57.121
If you get better, I
promise to join you

01:02:57.164 --> 01:02:58.992
when you go exploring.

01:03:00.298 --> 01:03:02.213
Oh Tim, don't leave us.

01:03:03.214 --> 01:03:04.258
- I'm sorry.

01:03:04.302 --> 01:03:05.869
I've been so selfish.

01:03:05.912 --> 01:03:08.219
But I promise you,
I've learned my lesson.

01:03:08.262 --> 01:03:10.221
You have to live, Tim.

01:03:10.264 --> 01:03:12.745
Todd needs you and
he love you so much

01:03:12.789 --> 01:03:15.139
and all of your brothers do too.

01:03:15.182 --> 01:03:16.183
And so do I.

01:03:17.706 --> 01:03:20.840
Thank you for being the best
friend in the world, Tim.

01:03:20.884 --> 01:03:22.929
For all those cool vibes.

01:03:24.801 --> 01:03:27.804
When one of you gets hurt, ow!

01:03:27.847 --> 01:03:29.675
This is no time
for jokes, Martin.

01:03:29.718 --> 01:03:31.546
- I didn't do a thing.

01:03:32.983 --> 01:03:33.853
Tim!

01:03:33.897 --> 01:03:35.028
- Tim, my brother.

01:03:35.072 --> 01:03:37.161
You have completely recovered.

01:03:40.686 --> 01:03:43.558
- You don't have leaves
in your hair, Tim.

01:03:43.602 --> 01:03:44.777
- That's a relief.

01:03:44.821 --> 01:03:46.257
Todd, you were totally right.

01:03:46.300 --> 01:03:48.085
I never should have
gone out of sight.

01:03:48.128 --> 01:03:49.782
- Well, if I've come along,

01:03:49.826 --> 01:03:52.263
sure things wouldn't
have gone so wrong.

01:03:52.306 --> 01:03:54.526
- The truth is it's
been really cool

01:03:54.569 --> 01:03:55.832
to get to know the humans.

01:03:55.875 --> 01:03:58.182
- Yes, and now it's
time go home, Tim.

01:03:58.225 --> 01:04:00.837
- Did I ever tell you that
I think you're a real star.

01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:02.577
- Yes and I loved it.

01:04:03.796 --> 01:04:05.145
I will never forget you.

01:04:05.189 --> 01:04:06.103
- For me and you.

01:04:06.146 --> 01:04:07.321
- Hey, over here.

01:04:07.365 --> 01:04:08.192
Teresa.

01:04:08.235 --> 01:04:09.497
Mom.

01:04:12.109 --> 01:04:13.719
- My little girl.

01:04:13.762 --> 01:04:14.589
I love you so much.

01:04:14.633 --> 01:04:15.852
- And I love you, mom.

01:04:15.895 --> 01:04:17.854
Mom, this us Tim.

01:04:17.897 --> 01:04:19.072
- Give me a high five, ma'am.

01:04:19.116 --> 01:04:21.466
- Thank you for being
Teresa's friend.

01:04:21.509 --> 01:04:22.771
- You're welcome.

01:04:22.815 --> 01:04:26.036
Your daughter and
I have cool vibes.

01:04:26.079 --> 01:04:27.385
See you later.

01:04:27.428 --> 01:04:28.777
Bye.

01:04:28.821 --> 01:04:31.519
- I feel so proud of you.

01:04:31.563 --> 01:04:33.130
- Thank you, mom.

01:04:33.173 --> 01:04:35.523
- Let's go home, little bro.

01:04:38.178 --> 01:04:39.179
- You nasty little critters.

01:04:39.223 --> 01:04:40.485
I'm gonna get all of you.

01:04:40.528 --> 01:04:42.617
- Watch out, Todd!

01:04:42.661 --> 01:04:43.792
Here I come.

01:04:43.836 --> 01:04:44.793
- Mom, it's Vlad.

01:04:44.837 --> 01:04:46.491
- The king of the undesirables.

01:04:46.534 --> 01:04:47.666
- Tim, run!

01:04:47.709 --> 01:04:48.841
- Quick, the catapult.

01:04:48.885 --> 01:04:50.016
Fire me at him.

01:04:50.974 --> 01:04:52.497
- Give that to me.

01:04:52.540 --> 01:04:53.237
I'm gonna show that creep
what a catapult can do.

01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:54.238
- Mom!

01:04:54.281 --> 01:04:55.108
- That's the spirit, lady!

01:04:55.152 --> 01:04:55.979
Are we ready?

01:04:56.022 --> 01:04:56.849
Are we set?

01:04:56.893 --> 01:04:57.719
Fire!

01:04:59.983 --> 01:05:00.984
- You miserable micro!

01:05:01.027 --> 01:05:02.899
- Let me at that nose!

01:05:02.942 --> 01:05:03.769
- Aw!

01:05:04.683 --> 01:05:06.337
- C'mon, get away!

01:05:06.380 --> 01:05:07.381
- Right, that's it.

01:05:07.425 --> 01:05:09.383
- Tim, look out!

01:05:09.427 --> 01:05:11.342
- C'mon on, Todd, c'mon.

01:05:11.385 --> 01:05:12.865
It's time to take
everything you've learned

01:05:12.909 --> 01:05:14.823
and put it into action.

01:05:14.867 --> 01:05:16.608
Mystical mistletoe,
sawdust to taint,

01:05:16.651 --> 01:05:18.436
we wish to be fun and
your causing the gate.

01:05:18.479 --> 01:05:19.611
With a one and a
two and a three.

01:05:21.047 --> 01:05:22.353
Bravo Todd.

01:05:22.396 --> 01:05:24.094
- Look at that, I
did pretty good.

01:05:24.137 --> 01:05:26.313
I never thought
I actually could.

01:05:26.357 --> 01:05:27.532
- You bet you did.

01:05:27.575 --> 01:05:29.882
That was an awesome
trick brother.

01:05:29.926 --> 01:05:31.971
- Hey guys, look at that.

01:05:32.015 --> 01:05:33.712
- I want to get out of here.

01:05:33.755 --> 01:05:35.279
Get me out of here!

01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:43.069
- Well that's the
perfect end to the story.

01:05:44.375 --> 01:05:46.899
- Hey, Lucas, where
are you going?

01:05:46.943 --> 01:05:48.118
- You poor little mutt, get off!

01:05:48.161 --> 01:05:48.988
Scram!

01:05:51.948 --> 01:05:52.861
- Goodbye, Tim.

01:05:52.905 --> 01:05:54.341
- Goodbye, Teresa.

01:05:54.385 --> 01:05:56.300
Cool vibes.

01:05:56.343 --> 01:05:57.562
- Goodbye, Tim.

01:06:00.434 --> 01:06:03.437
Mom, didn't you want a
photo for the magazine?

01:06:03.481 --> 01:06:04.656
- Of course, honey.

01:06:04.699 --> 01:06:06.005
It's incredible.

01:06:07.267 --> 01:06:09.313
That's the true
spirit of springtime.

01:06:09.356 --> 01:06:11.402
- Wait, there's one more.

01:06:13.621 --> 01:06:16.189
You can go home, at last.

01:06:16.233 --> 01:06:18.322
- I'm me again, thank you.

01:06:18.365 --> 01:06:20.367
- Goodbye my old friend.

01:06:22.674 --> 01:06:24.850
No mom, they
don't have moms or dads.

01:06:24.893 --> 01:06:26.069
They're all brothers.

01:06:26.112 --> 01:06:28.332
Tim said there's more
that a million of them.

01:06:28.375 --> 01:06:30.943
- Can you imagine having a
million brothers like John.

01:06:30.987 --> 01:06:33.076
- I think one's
enough for Teresa.

01:06:33.119 --> 01:06:34.033
Right sweetie?

01:06:34.077 --> 01:06:35.339
- That's cause he's the best.

01:06:35.382 --> 01:06:37.994
Isn't that right,
little brother?

01:07:03.976 --> 01:07:05.456
- John, over here.

01:07:07.675 --> 01:07:09.764
- Springtime, at last.

01:07:09.808 --> 01:07:11.288
Will he be happy to see me?

01:07:11.331 --> 01:07:13.507
- I think you better
ask him that yourself.

01:07:13.551 --> 01:07:14.421
There he is.

01:07:14.465 --> 01:07:15.292
- Teresa!

01:07:15.335 --> 01:07:16.119
- Tim!

01:07:16.162 --> 01:07:18.034
There you are!

01:07:21.037 --> 01:07:22.255
Go for it, Sam!

01:07:26.912 --> 01:07:29.306

Now watch how a
real star does it.

01:08:38.243 --> 01:08:40.420
