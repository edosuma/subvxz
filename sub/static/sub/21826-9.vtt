WEBVTT

00:04.180 --> 00:07.635
Man, I dread these
chemotherapy mornings.

00:07.641 --> 00:09.880
Especially since you told
me Nurse Chris was gay.

00:09.886 --> 00:12.071
- I thought he was flirting with me.
- Well, you know what?

00:12.077 --> 00:13.849
Why don't we give you
something to look forward to?

00:13.875 --> 00:16.505
After chemo, I'm gonna treat
you to some ice cream-o.

00:16.505 --> 00:18.885
Oh, rum raisin, here I come.

00:18.885 --> 00:20.715
Aw, please get a flavor that I like.

00:20.715 --> 00:23.175
You know I'm gonna end up
eating most of it, anyway.

00:25.116 --> 00:26.553
Traditore.

00:26.946 --> 00:28.456
Danny, what are you doing here?

00:28.456 --> 00:30.532
- Tratidore.
- What does that mean?

00:30.540 --> 00:32.090
It's Italian for traitor.

00:32.090 --> 00:33.800
Mindy, how could you?

00:33.800 --> 00:36.130
Hiding my mother's own
cancer diagnosis from me?

00:36.130 --> 00:38.180
- Are you kidding me?
- Hey, hey, keep it down.

00:38.180 --> 00:40.300
For the record, it is not my fault.

00:40.300 --> 00:41.930
She made me promise not to tell you.

00:41.930 --> 00:44.270
What? Promise not to tell me?

00:44.270 --> 00:45.850
That's nuts. We tell
each other everything.

00:45.850 --> 00:48.650
We're best friends. I write
you a letter every night.

00:48.650 --> 00:51.730
It's a lot. And I appreciate it.

00:51.730 --> 00:54.730
Oh, sweetie, it's just
that I know how you get.

00:54.730 --> 00:57.590
How I get? How I get?
What the hell does that mean?

00:57.596 --> 00:59.950
It means that you go psycho
over the smallest things.

00:59.950 --> 01:02.580
For instance, how long have you
been waiting here to pounce on us?

01:02.580 --> 01:04.364
Not long. A couple hours. I organized

01:04.370 --> 01:06.590
your books. I did my sit-ups. I'm cool.

01:06.596 --> 01:09.040
Oh, sweetheart. Honey, I just didn't

01:09.040 --> 01:10.786
want you to worry.

01:10.792 --> 01:12.926
We're both so sorry.

01:13.179 --> 01:15.170
Ma, you I forgive.

01:15.170 --> 01:17.260
You're being stoic to protect your baby.

01:17.565 --> 01:20.930
You, on the other hand, unforgivablio.

01:20.930 --> 01:23.600
- I don't think that's Italian.
- Ma, from now on,

01:23.600 --> 01:25.430
I'm taking you to chemo. Me and you.

01:25.430 --> 01:27.100
And then we're going to church to pray.

01:27.100 --> 01:28.557
And we're gonna ask the Holy Ghost

01:28.563 --> 01:30.100
to knock some sense into this one.

01:30.247 --> 01:31.707
Let's get the hell out of here.

01:31.771 --> 01:33.651
Hey, Dr. C. How's it going?

01:33.651 --> 01:35.691
- Fine, Tamra.
- Oh, hey, Danny.

01:35.691 --> 01:37.281
- Long time no see.
- Hi, Jody.

01:37.281 --> 01:39.321
How's it going? Danny, what a treat.

01:39.321 --> 01:41.201
Shall I make you a cup
of lapsang souchong?

01:41.201 --> 01:44.831
- No, absolutely not.
- Dr. C., so great to see you.

01:44.831 --> 01:47.041
Okay, you I barely know. Look, everyone,

01:47.041 --> 01:49.331
I don't have time for the
individual pleasantries.

01:49.331 --> 01:51.461
I'm in a bad mood.
Don't take it personally.

01:51.461 --> 01:53.131
It's like at the Oscars,
when you acknowledge

01:53.131 --> 01:54.881
your family and the Academy, goodbye.

01:54.881 --> 01:56.881
- Let's go, Ma.
- Oh, my God.

01:56.881 --> 01:59.221
My favorite man.
Let me see those smackers.

01:59.221 --> 02:01.551
Oh, yeah. We have a lot
of catching up to do.

02:01.551 --> 02:02.927
Uh, Morgan, I don't have time right now.

02:02.933 --> 02:04.391
Uh, I just need 90 minutes.

02:04.391 --> 02:05.721
I'll give you 15 seconds.

02:05.721 --> 02:06.802
- 15 seconds?
- Yeah.

02:06.808 --> 02:09.770
Okay, uh, I'm blanking.
Did you see "Wonder Woman?"

02:09.770 --> 02:12.101
I didn't see it. What
happens? No spoilers.

02:12.101 --> 02:13.901
We're pregnant and getting married.

02:13.901 --> 02:15.271
God bless. Let's go, Ma.

02:15.271 --> 02:17.111
- Salud.
- But that wasn't it.

02:17.111 --> 02:18.691
That wasn't... Damn it.

02:19.358 --> 02:21.028
It's good to see him.

02:38.346 --> 02:40.821
Everyone, I am so excited to announce

02:40.827 --> 02:43.747
that I will be hosting
Tamra's "braby" shower.

02:43.747 --> 02:45.242
♪ Oh ♪

02:45.248 --> 02:47.024
"Braby" is a fun portmanteau

02:47.030 --> 02:48.734
word combining two ideas.

02:48.761 --> 02:50.106
Oh. What?

02:50.112 --> 02:53.157
Guys, it's a bridal and baby shower.

02:53.163 --> 02:55.242
- Isn't that hella sweet?
- Aww.

02:55.242 --> 02:57.362
It is so inspiring to
have a female doctor

02:57.362 --> 02:58.862
- that I can look up to.
- Oh.

02:58.862 --> 03:00.952
Hey, hey. Tamra, what the hell?

03:00.952 --> 03:02.990
I hired you, okay? I was the one that

03:02.996 --> 03:05.633
introduced you to your
probably first husband.

03:05.639 --> 03:07.713
Also, I'm planning your baby shower.

03:07.719 --> 03:10.632
Guys, I have rented a room
in the Rainforest Café.

03:10.632 --> 03:13.632
We're gonna be doing a
screening of "Boss Baby."

03:13.632 --> 03:17.172
If they can hook up a TV.
They have yet to call me back.

03:17.172 --> 03:20.972
Hey, we love you so much.
We're so grateful for you.

03:20.972 --> 03:23.273
But Dr. Z is a little
classier and wealthier.

03:23.279 --> 03:24.450
Oh, oh!

03:24.456 --> 03:26.319
It's settled. Anna will
host the braby shower.

03:26.325 --> 03:27.955
Mindy, you can host something else.

03:27.961 --> 03:29.991
You know, I recently got my citizenship.

03:29.997 --> 03:32.157
What? You're a citizen?
What about our wall?

03:32.163 --> 03:33.180
Oh, no, no, no.

03:33.186 --> 03:34.806
- I have a quick announcement.
- Please.

03:34.812 --> 03:35.900
Pardon me.

03:35.906 --> 03:38.185
I've met a woman, I've fallen in love,

03:38.191 --> 03:39.572
and we're moving to Africa together.

03:39.572 --> 03:40.782
Colette is coming with us.

03:40.782 --> 03:42.049
- It's true.
- Bye.

03:42.055 --> 03:43.162
- Um...
- Huh?

03:43.162 --> 03:44.582
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What?

03:44.582 --> 03:45.952
- Jody?
- Now?

03:47.895 --> 03:49.605
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You're leaving?

03:49.611 --> 03:51.206
This is the single most
irresponsible thing

03:51.212 --> 03:53.382
I've ever heard. And I work here.

03:53.382 --> 03:55.422
- With her.
- Yeah, with me.

03:55.422 --> 03:57.462
What... I thought you'd be happy for me.

03:57.462 --> 03:59.342
I finally met an accomplished,
age-appropriate woman.

03:59.342 --> 04:00.934
She even remembers "Dukes of Hazzard."

04:00.940 --> 04:03.077
You all thought that was some
racist fever dream I had.

04:03.083 --> 04:04.579
Tamra and Morgan are going on

04:04.585 --> 04:06.282
their honeymoon to Essence Fest

04:06.288 --> 04:08.578
and then Tamra is going
on maternity leave.

04:08.584 --> 04:10.444
Without Colette, we'll have no nurses.

04:10.450 --> 04:12.346
Oh, well, these are
just the sorts of small

04:12.352 --> 04:14.562
logistical issues that
you smart Ivy Leaguers

04:14.562 --> 04:16.192
can figure out all by yourselves.

04:16.192 --> 04:18.843
You were fine before we got here.
You'll be fine after we leave.

04:18.849 --> 04:20.639
This is reprehensible.

04:20.707 --> 04:23.207
Okay, the office is under
financial strain as it is.

04:23.402 --> 04:25.112
You know, this is last
year's stethoscope.

04:25.112 --> 04:26.547
Everyone has noticed.

04:26.553 --> 04:28.532
Jeremy, I don't want to
leave on these terms.

04:28.532 --> 04:30.372
What if a hippo snaps me in half,

04:30.372 --> 04:32.162
and my last thought is how
I left things with you?

04:32.162 --> 04:34.002
Well then, that's between
you and your hippo.

04:34.002 --> 04:36.582
I can't believe I once gave
a pint of my own blood

04:36.582 --> 04:38.252
for you to fail a paternity test.

04:38.252 --> 04:39.342
Ladies.

04:43.222 --> 04:44.932
I don't know, Morgan. I'm torn.

04:44.932 --> 04:46.972
Part of me is really happy for Jody.

04:46.972 --> 04:49.562
You know, for maturing
and finally finding someone.

04:49.562 --> 04:51.432
But I'm gonna miss him.

04:51.432 --> 04:53.232
Well, if it makes you
feel any better, Dr. L,

04:53.232 --> 04:55.402
I will never leave this practice.

04:55.402 --> 04:57.402
I don't have a lot of options
'cause of my criminal record

04:57.402 --> 04:59.652
and personality, etcuh etcuh.

04:59.652 --> 05:01.072
That didn't make me feel much better.

05:01.072 --> 05:02.572
Sorry.

05:02.572 --> 05:04.152
Oh, it's from Annette.

05:05.940 --> 05:07.780
Chemo is at 3:00.

05:07.839 --> 05:10.259
Can you bring the next
"Gilmore Girls" DVD?

05:10.259 --> 05:12.701
I hope Rory gets into her study abroad.

05:12.912 --> 05:14.549
Is that a good idea?

05:14.549 --> 05:16.969
Danny seemed pretty
adamant that I stay out of it.

05:16.969 --> 05:18.729
His "Mindy" vein was popping.

05:18.729 --> 05:21.269
The bad one in his forehead,
not the good one.

05:21.269 --> 05:23.769
Gross. But I want you to be there.

05:23.769 --> 05:25.399
He's just gonna have to deal.

05:25.399 --> 05:27.649
Okay, I'll be there.

05:27.649 --> 05:29.739
With Lorelai and Rory and Luke

05:29.739 --> 05:31.779
and all the other quirky white people.

05:33.659 --> 05:36.159
Hey, what's the name of
the country we're going to?

05:36.159 --> 05:37.474
I couldn't find it on a map.

05:37.480 --> 05:39.279
Oh, the names and borders keep changing

05:39.279 --> 05:41.699
because of warlord this and coup that.

05:41.699 --> 05:43.695
I know the flag always has a gun on it.

05:43.701 --> 05:44.805
Boy, the Kimball-Kinneys

05:44.811 --> 05:46.266
- love adventure, don't we?
- Yeah.

05:48.772 --> 05:50.732
Bonjour, everyone.

05:50.732 --> 05:52.314
Welcome to orientation and

05:52.320 --> 05:54.010
to a new chapter in your life.

05:54.016 --> 05:57.436
All brought to you by
Médecins Sur Le Front.

05:57.742 --> 06:01.412
Welcome, mes amis, to
Physicians on the Front.

06:04.995 --> 06:06.073
Hey.

06:06.331 --> 06:08.905
I just wanna say I'm
so sorry about earlier,

06:08.911 --> 06:11.149
and I think it's really
cool that you reconsidered.

06:11.155 --> 06:13.622
I didn't. Ma insisted,
and I didn't want to argue

06:13.628 --> 06:16.336
with a cancer patient, okay?
The focus here is cancer,

06:16.342 --> 06:18.483
not these petty fights.
This is about cancer.

06:18.499 --> 06:20.709
Okay, I think you used that word a lot.

06:20.709 --> 06:23.202
- What word? Cancer?
- Yes, Cancer.

06:23.208 --> 06:25.293
And I just think it might be kind
of a bummer for her to have

06:25.299 --> 06:27.681
- to hear it over and over again.
- It is a bummer. It's cancer.

06:27.687 --> 06:29.669
Now, look, when we get inside,
let me handle things.

06:29.669 --> 06:31.213
My ma, my rules. I don't tell

06:31.219 --> 06:32.969
your ma to make globbity gloop.

06:32.969 --> 06:34.493
- That's pretty offensive.
- I'm sorry,

06:34.499 --> 06:36.329
I can't learn every name of
every food in the world.

06:36.335 --> 06:37.875
My ma has cancer.

06:40.732 --> 06:42.482
And together,

06:42.488 --> 06:45.074
we can tell violence and famine

06:45.436 --> 06:46.973
Au revoir.

06:49.569 --> 06:52.199
After surveying hundreds
of health professionals

06:52.199 --> 06:54.409
on their return from
Physicians on the Front,

06:54.409 --> 06:56.079
we have narrowed their experience

06:56.079 --> 06:58.159
into some pros and cons.

06:58.159 --> 07:01.119
Pro: Helping the less fortunate.

07:01.119 --> 07:02.335
That sounds nice.

07:02.341 --> 07:04.551
Con: Disease.

07:04.749 --> 07:07.499
Con: Kidnapping.

07:07.499 --> 07:10.049
Con: Child soldiers.

07:10.448 --> 07:12.719
Con: No Internet access.

07:12.719 --> 07:16.145
Con: A sense of existential ennui.

07:16.168 --> 07:18.009
Oui, in the front.

07:18.009 --> 07:20.139
Are you going back to the pro list?

07:20.139 --> 07:21.974
Oh, oui, uh...

07:22.475 --> 07:24.120
I think we've covered it.

07:24.283 --> 07:26.440
Con: Deadly bugs.

07:26.519 --> 07:28.954
Con: No Christmas.

07:29.735 --> 07:32.609
Previously on "The Gilmore Girls."

07:32.609 --> 07:35.779
Rory wants to study art
history abroad in Paris.

07:35.779 --> 07:37.829
I hope it happens. She's so talented

07:37.829 --> 07:39.699
- at her water colors.
- No, no, no.

07:39.699 --> 07:42.579
She should stay in Stars
Hollow and do bookkeeping.

07:42.579 --> 07:43.816
That's what I did.

07:43.822 --> 07:45.919
- And I had a good enough life.
- Tell you one thing.

07:45.919 --> 07:47.539
Rory's grandmother agrees with you.

07:47.539 --> 07:49.379
But Lorelai has different ideas.

07:49.379 --> 07:51.626
And we're gonna find out
exactly what they are.

07:52.708 --> 07:55.389
Sir, if you stand any closer,
you're gonna have to buy me dinner.

07:55.389 --> 07:56.969
Are you sure you got
the proportions right?

07:56.969 --> 07:58.509
- You went awfully fast.
- No, sir.

07:58.509 --> 07:59.929
I've only been doing this for ten years.

07:59.929 --> 08:01.230
Five in the military.

08:01.236 --> 08:03.326
Well, thank you for your service.

08:03.332 --> 08:05.492
But I don't like your attitude.
I don't like your tone at all.

08:05.498 --> 08:07.458
Danny, don't bother him.
He knows what he's doing.

08:07.464 --> 08:09.359
I don't know this guy.
He could be a serial killer.

08:09.359 --> 08:12.109
He's not a serial killer,
Danny. It's Nurse Chris.

08:12.109 --> 08:13.546
But where's the oncologist? I mean,

08:13.552 --> 08:16.109
does Dr. Richlin ever show up?
Or do the three of you decide

08:16.109 --> 08:18.286
what the treatment's gonna be
over junk food and chick flicks?

08:18.292 --> 08:19.656
Danny, settle down.

08:19.662 --> 08:21.783
Danny, everything's fine, okay?

08:21.789 --> 08:23.499
And I frankly don't think it's helpful

08:23.499 --> 08:25.289
for you to tell people
how to do their jobs.

08:25.289 --> 08:26.959
Everything's not fine here. Okay, Mindy?

08:26.959 --> 08:28.919
Why are you even
here in the first place?

08:33.799 --> 08:36.207
Okay, look. You're upset.

08:36.481 --> 08:38.299
Your mom's sick, I understand.

08:38.299 --> 08:40.506
So, I... I'm just gonna go.

08:40.513 --> 08:41.525
I'm gonna go.

08:46.769 --> 08:48.309
Nice going.

08:48.309 --> 08:50.399
Now you put a damper on "Gilmore Girls."

08:54.463 --> 08:55.888
I mean, can you believe that

08:55.894 --> 08:57.364
Danny would say that to me?

08:57.370 --> 09:00.226
Words cannot express...
No, reaction GIFs...

09:00.232 --> 09:02.232
Cannot express how hurtful it was.

09:02.232 --> 09:04.442
I'm sorry, can I have my
coffee cake back now?

09:04.442 --> 09:05.812
No, Anna, no.

09:05.812 --> 09:07.362
Ooh, just who I wanted to see.

09:07.362 --> 09:08.942
Morgan and Tamra are
stuck at the hospital.

09:08.942 --> 09:10.692
It's on lockdown. Something about a body

09:10.692 --> 09:12.202
walking out of the morgue. Anyway,

09:12.202 --> 09:13.662
I thought us three could discuss

09:13.662 --> 09:15.072
a joint wedding gift for them.

09:15.072 --> 09:16.622
A group gift? That's great.

09:16.622 --> 09:18.332
The easiest way to cheap out.

09:18.332 --> 09:20.148
Are we talking Tamra-
Morgan wedding gifts?

09:20.154 --> 09:22.332
I thought we could all go in
on something they really need.

09:22.332 --> 09:24.332
Like a buffalo head for the nursery.

09:24.332 --> 09:26.177
Did someone hear something? It's like

09:26.183 --> 09:28.172
the brittle squeak of a former friend.

09:28.172 --> 09:29.592
Oh, I see.

09:29.592 --> 09:30.866
You're pretending not to hear me.

09:30.872 --> 09:32.842
- Very mature.
- No, it's... lt's still there.

09:32.842 --> 09:34.222
Oh, we'll get an exterminator.

09:34.222 --> 09:35.682
Anyway, anyway, um,

09:35.682 --> 09:37.392
I thought us three loyal doctors

09:37.392 --> 09:39.597
could split a gift together.

09:39.603 --> 09:42.738
I do like the idea of going in on a gift

09:42.744 --> 09:44.392
without the taint of betrayal.

09:44.392 --> 09:45.982
If you guys feel really strongly,

09:45.982 --> 09:47.692
then I think that's what we should do.

09:47.692 --> 09:49.442
And Jody can just figure
out his own gift.

09:49.442 --> 09:51.532
Great, it's settled.
The three of us will split

09:51.532 --> 09:53.891
a vintage chaise longue from
the home of Wallis Simpson.

09:53.897 --> 09:56.112
I already ordered it.
It didn't fit in our apartment.

09:56.112 --> 09:58.452
Fine, I'll buy the buffalo head myself.

09:58.452 --> 10:00.122
Probably have to be a smaller animal,

10:00.122 --> 10:02.633
but that mounted muskrat
will come from the heart.

10:06.502 --> 10:07.792
I mean, he hates it when we commandeer

10:07.792 --> 10:09.422
two tables during rush hour.

10:09.422 --> 10:11.302
No, he only hated it that one time...

10:11.302 --> 10:13.722
I don't get this show.
Why do they gotta talk so fast?

10:13.722 --> 10:15.946
Any time anything happens,
someone's got a little remark.

10:15.952 --> 10:17.822
That's called good writing.

10:17.828 --> 10:19.295
You want good writing?

10:19.301 --> 10:21.176
Let me show you "JAG" sometime.

10:21.182 --> 10:23.142
You are not much fun to watch this with.

10:23.142 --> 10:24.732
No, you're not.

10:24.732 --> 10:26.392
Yeah, I'm glad you turned it off.

10:26.392 --> 10:28.192
Now we can focus on why we're here.

10:28.192 --> 10:29.280
Cancer.

10:30.030 --> 10:31.272
Breast cancer.

10:31.272 --> 10:33.532
Ma, I can't believe the
breast that gave me life

10:33.532 --> 10:34.992
is now trying to take yours.

10:34.992 --> 10:36.532
Danny, you gotta pull it together.

10:36.532 --> 10:38.322
You're really bumming everybody out.

10:38.322 --> 10:40.532
Hey, Ma, you wanna see
some pictures on my phone?

10:40.532 --> 10:41.952
- Yes.
- I was in Miami.

10:41.952 --> 10:43.582
- Yeah?
- It was leather week.

10:43.582 --> 10:44.952
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Don't show her that.

10:44.952 --> 10:46.332
Come on, those guys are too hot.

10:46.332 --> 10:48.770
She needs to stay calm, okay?
And we need to focus.

10:48.776 --> 10:50.916
Okay, Ma, you can't win a battle

10:50.922 --> 10:52.382
without a good battle plan.

10:52.382 --> 10:53.922
Any good general will tell you that.

10:53.922 --> 10:55.302
Okay, fine.

10:55.302 --> 10:57.552
What's the battle plan, Custer?

10:58.011 --> 10:59.392
A book called

10:59.392 --> 11:02.062
"Curing Cancer Through
Prayer and Healthy Eating."

11:02.062 --> 11:04.602
Now, I thought I'd read aloud from it

11:04.602 --> 11:06.001
during each of these sessions

11:06.007 --> 11:07.352
to soothe and inspire you.

11:07.800 --> 11:10.732
"Introduction. The Lord is our savior.

11:10.732 --> 11:12.692
"Could he also be our nutritionist?

11:12.692 --> 11:14.862
"Over the next 500 pages,

11:14.862 --> 11:17.174
"I'll attempt to answer that question."

11:17.822 --> 11:19.662
Just do it, Morgan.

11:22.622 --> 11:25.292
I'm sorry, you want me to
shoot you in the foot?

11:25.292 --> 11:27.904
I have terrible aim. Think
about our bathroom floor.

11:27.910 --> 11:30.172
Look, if you don't shoot
me, I'm gonna have to go

11:30.172 --> 11:32.042
to the dysentery capital of the world.

11:32.042 --> 11:35.422
And they don't have
cable, WNBA, or lesbians.

11:35.422 --> 11:37.472
Why can't you just tell your
brother you don't wanna go?

11:37.472 --> 11:39.132
Jody won't understand.

11:39.132 --> 11:41.432
We have never been
apart in our entire life.

11:41.432 --> 11:42.972
This way I can stay here

11:42.972 --> 11:44.642
and neither one of us have to get hurt.

11:44.642 --> 11:46.102
Well, except for my foot.

11:46.102 --> 11:47.562
Okay, look, I love the easy way out.

11:47.562 --> 11:49.312
I cut holes in all my underwear,

11:49.312 --> 11:51.442
front and back. But you
need to talk to your...

11:51.442 --> 11:52.772
Morgan, what...

11:52.772 --> 11:54.072
Oh, oh, oh!

11:54.072 --> 11:55.862
Oh, my God! Ah, ah, ah!

11:56.290 --> 11:59.072
The next smoothie recipe
is blueberry blast.

11:59.072 --> 12:01.202
Blueberries, almond butter...

12:01.202 --> 12:02.872
A-gave?

12:04.332 --> 12:06.702
- Kale, banana, fresh yogurt...
- All right, stop.

12:06.702 --> 12:09.542
Please, stop reading me these recipes.

12:09.542 --> 12:10.872
Okay, that's fair enough. All right,

12:10.872 --> 12:12.332
what do you guys wanna talk about

12:12.332 --> 12:13.978
to get your mind off cancer?

12:13.984 --> 12:16.746
Well, Mindy always
brought fun stuff to read.

12:16.752 --> 12:19.922
Like celebrity gossip magazines
or her neighbor's mail.

12:19.922 --> 12:21.429
You got any fun things?

12:21.435 --> 12:23.592
You know any celebrity gossip?

12:23.981 --> 12:27.153
Oh. Uh, Sinatra supposedly had

12:27.159 --> 12:28.660
a thing with Nancy Reagan.

12:28.666 --> 12:31.250
- I don't believe it.
- That stunk.

12:31.256 --> 12:33.314
You know what? Why don't
we let Richie talk?

12:33.322 --> 12:35.282
So Richie, how are things in LA?

12:35.282 --> 12:37.282
Um, they're not that great, Ma.

12:37.282 --> 12:40.119
Uh, I didn't get cast on "Survivor."

12:40.412 --> 12:43.292
Again. And that was...
That was really plan A.

12:43.292 --> 12:44.593
Uh, I was hoping maybe I

12:44.599 --> 12:46.002
could get $20, $25 grand

12:46.002 --> 12:47.375
just to hold me over until next

12:47.687 --> 12:49.098
year's castings of "Survivor."

12:49.104 --> 12:50.542
Let's talk about that later.

12:50.542 --> 12:52.802
You know what I'd like?
I would love one of those

12:52.802 --> 12:55.672
- cupcakes that Mindy made.
- I threw those out.

12:55.672 --> 12:57.512
But I got you something
better than cupcakes.

12:57.598 --> 12:59.084
Jicama.

12:59.090 --> 13:01.130
All the crunch of apple
with the taste of air.

13:01.302 --> 13:02.834
- Okay, out.
- What?

13:02.840 --> 13:04.722
Out. Look, I love you.

13:04.722 --> 13:06.642
And I can't believe I'm saying this,

13:06.642 --> 13:09.442
but you're the worst part of chemo.

13:09.442 --> 13:11.232
- Me?
- Yeah, you. Go.

13:13.156 --> 13:15.036
Richie, let me see the Miami pictures.

13:15.042 --> 13:17.082
- Come on.
- This is Rudy.

13:17.082 --> 13:18.712
That's Raul. That's the, uh...

13:18.712 --> 13:20.380
That's the belt you
gave me for Christmas.

13:20.386 --> 13:21.917
I didn't know you could
do that with a belt.

13:21.923 --> 13:23.426
- They're twins.
- Oh, aren't they... they're...

13:23.432 --> 13:24.432
Oh, my.

13:29.472 --> 13:31.142
Hola, señor.

13:31.142 --> 13:33.632
Dr. Lahiri?

13:33.638 --> 13:35.638
Uh, I'm Dr. Lahiri.

13:35.953 --> 13:37.653
Wait, did you just think I

13:37.659 --> 13:39.925
was a male Hispanic janitor?

13:40.205 --> 13:42.649
Yes, but only because of your build

13:42.655 --> 13:44.008
and the fact that you were rooting

13:44.014 --> 13:45.422
around in that trash bin.

13:45.428 --> 13:46.755
Okay, earlier, I threw out a

13:46.761 --> 13:48.129
donut to prove that I could

13:48.135 --> 13:50.425
take a bite and leave it.
And now that I've done that,

13:50.425 --> 13:51.965
I want the donut.

13:51.965 --> 13:54.225
Mary Hernandez. Jody's girlfriend.

13:54.613 --> 13:57.685
Wow, I'm so excited to meet you.

13:57.685 --> 13:59.435
Jody usually only dates jailbait.

13:59.435 --> 14:01.815
We're talking super young, super tight,

14:01.815 --> 14:03.605
legal, but barely. And like...

14:03.605 --> 14:05.235
You know what? I think that's...

14:05.235 --> 14:06.945
That's probably all I needed to hear.

14:06.945 --> 14:08.865
I actually came to talk to you.

14:08.865 --> 14:10.995
I hear that you and the
other doctors are giving

14:11.001 --> 14:12.865
Jody a hard time about
leaving for Africa.

14:12.865 --> 14:14.575
Yeah, Mary. We are.

14:14.575 --> 14:16.615
To be honest, he's
really screwing us over.

14:16.615 --> 14:18.245
And aren't you moving kinda fast?

14:18.245 --> 14:20.285
Jody took longer to
pick a new haberdasher.

14:20.285 --> 14:22.335
Well, I think that our relationship

14:22.335 --> 14:24.965
has been really good
for Jody. He's evolving.

14:24.965 --> 14:27.175
He hardly ever calls me Colette
when he tells me he loves me.

14:27.175 --> 14:29.215
We... We... We just bought
a mosquito net for two.

14:29.215 --> 14:30.710
He keeps a locket of my

14:30.716 --> 14:32.465
hair in his pocket watch.

14:32.465 --> 14:34.805
So, you guys are pretty serious, huh?

14:34.805 --> 14:36.182
Yeah, I mean...

14:37.135 --> 14:38.550
We're in love.

14:38.722 --> 14:40.895
Well, I thought that I could
come here and convince you.

14:40.895 --> 14:42.225
Obviously, I can't.

14:42.225 --> 14:43.725
But, uh, I tried.

14:44.100 --> 14:45.645
Nice meeting you.

14:49.065 --> 14:50.825
There you are.

14:55.195 --> 14:57.365
An automatic dog feeder?

14:57.365 --> 15:00.495
Oh, yes! Thank you, guys. Thank you.

15:00.495 --> 15:02.665
Babe, you have really outdone yourself.

15:02.665 --> 15:04.295
I mean, this truly is the perfect blend

15:04.295 --> 15:06.005
of a baby and a bridal shower.

15:06.005 --> 15:08.335
And the baby bottles filled with rosé

15:08.335 --> 15:10.339
were a sparkling touch.

15:10.755 --> 15:13.555
Oh, Jody came. The gall.

15:13.555 --> 15:15.975
Hello, Jeremy. Where do we put gifts?

15:15.975 --> 15:17.685
I wonder if anyone will "ferret" out

15:17.685 --> 15:19.345
what I got the happy couple.

15:19.345 --> 15:21.225
Anna, keep a lookout for party crashers.

15:21.225 --> 15:24.315
I believe the Ghost of
Friendships Past is in the area.

15:24.315 --> 15:25.985
Look, I brought Dr. Montpellier,

15:25.985 --> 15:27.485
the head of our program,
to explain to you

15:27.485 --> 15:29.105
how important our work is.

15:29.105 --> 15:31.525
Thank you for having me. Where I work,

15:31.525 --> 15:34.575
there is such high infant
and bridal mortality

15:34.575 --> 15:37.655
that such a party would be impossible.

15:37.655 --> 15:39.705
Now I hear two ghosts.

15:39.705 --> 15:41.455
Maybe we should call a Ghostbuster.

15:41.455 --> 15:42.777
- Jeremy...
- Jeremy.

15:42.783 --> 15:44.453
- Oh, Anna...
- Thank you for coming.

15:44.459 --> 15:46.375
Oh, my... Colette. My darling.

15:46.375 --> 15:47.864
What happened to your perfect foot?

15:47.870 --> 15:49.593
Oh, bad news.

15:49.599 --> 15:51.329
I lost a toe in an accident.

15:51.335 --> 15:53.175
Dropped a hockey skate
right on top of it.

15:53.175 --> 15:54.845
- Oh.
- Clean cut.

15:54.845 --> 15:57.425
Well, I guess I'm not
gonna be able to go

15:57.425 --> 15:59.685
- to Physicians on the Front.
- Oh, no.

15:59.685 --> 16:01.475
And you were so excited too.

16:01.475 --> 16:03.562
No, I have great news
for you, ma chérie.

16:03.568 --> 16:05.103
It is not a problem. Many of our

16:05.109 --> 16:06.975
physicians and nurses suffer injuries

16:06.975 --> 16:09.605
and continue to be a valuable
part of our program.

16:09.605 --> 16:11.775
- There you go.
- Well, hah, that's...

16:11.775 --> 16:13.775
That's great news.

16:13.775 --> 16:15.924
But how many toes would it take

16:15.930 --> 16:17.865
to get out of the program?

16:17.865 --> 16:20.705
We have a doctor who is just
a torso in a wheelbarrow.

16:20.705 --> 16:21.955
Oh, my God.

16:21.955 --> 16:23.915
Oh, all right. That's it.

16:23.915 --> 16:25.915
I ain't going on this trip.

16:33.908 --> 16:35.051
Colette, I am shocked.

16:35.057 --> 16:36.245
Why wouldn't you want

16:36.251 --> 16:37.458
to accompany your older brother

16:37.464 --> 16:38.548
on a perilous medical trip

16:38.554 --> 16:40.054
to be with the woman he loves?

16:40.054 --> 16:41.604
Well, at least one Kimball-Kinney

16:41.604 --> 16:43.125
has a sense of loyalty to Shulman's.

16:43.131 --> 16:45.268
Nah, it's more like hatred of travel

16:45.274 --> 16:47.354
mixed with mild xenophobia.

16:47.354 --> 16:49.024
How does it feel, Jody?

16:49.024 --> 16:51.508
Enjoying the salty
aftertaste of betrayal?

16:51.672 --> 16:52.940
No, I am not.

16:52.946 --> 16:54.786
It seems everyone I know
is against me going,

16:54.786 --> 16:57.616
and now even my own sister
thinks it's a bad idea.

16:57.616 --> 17:00.206
I suppose Dr. Hernandez
and I can just part ways.

17:00.206 --> 17:02.418
It's only three years
and half a world away.

17:02.424 --> 17:05.003
- We can survive that.
- Oh no, she will be mine by then.

17:05.003 --> 17:07.054
- God.
- Dr. K...

17:07.054 --> 17:09.304
I know you value my opinion
above everyone else's.

17:09.304 --> 17:11.223
And I am glad you're staying.

17:11.223 --> 17:13.223
But just so we're clear, we
already gave up your seat

17:13.223 --> 17:15.013
at the wedding. But
you're welcome to come

17:15.013 --> 17:16.854
- to the endless church part.
- But not the food part.

17:16.854 --> 17:18.367
Excuse me.

17:18.373 --> 17:20.953
You know it's a big deal if
I'm willing to step away

17:20.959 --> 17:22.521
from the fondue station
to say something.

17:22.528 --> 17:25.204
- Yeah, you finished it. It's all gone.
- It's not pouring out,

17:25.210 --> 17:26.938
but you can still scrape at it.

17:26.944 --> 17:28.249
- Sorry.
- The point is,

17:28.257 --> 17:29.777
yes, it's really annoying

17:29.783 --> 17:31.297
that Jody is leaving us

17:31.297 --> 17:33.177
right when he stopped
being a huge sexist

17:33.177 --> 17:35.717
and he got his drinking
relatively under control.

17:35.717 --> 17:38.017
Well, that's about to end. Thank you.

17:38.017 --> 17:40.597
But I don't think there is a
single person in our office

17:40.597 --> 17:43.907
who hasn't sacrificed
everything for true love.

17:44.687 --> 17:47.487
There's Morgan and Tamra,
or Jeremy and Anna.

17:47.487 --> 17:49.657
Or Beverly and the Green River Killer.

17:49.657 --> 17:51.697
Hell, what about me? I moved to Haiti,

17:51.697 --> 17:53.987
I chopped off all my hair,
there was that one time

17:53.987 --> 17:56.094
- I married a nurse.
- What's wrong with that?

17:56.100 --> 17:58.957
And let's face it, guys.
We're all sappy romantics.

17:58.957 --> 18:00.827
And we turned Jody into one too.

18:00.827 --> 18:03.337
So I don't think we can
stop him from going.

18:03.337 --> 18:05.547
Mindy's right. People
told me I was crazy

18:05.547 --> 18:07.834
when I moved in with a straight
man who owns espadrilles,

18:07.840 --> 18:09.817
but it was the best
decision I've ever made.

18:10.087 --> 18:12.387
Thank you, Mindy. I'm
always shocked when

18:12.387 --> 18:14.597
you make a coherent point
without a mouth full of food.

18:14.597 --> 18:16.517
You're welcome.

18:16.517 --> 18:18.206
What do you say, Jeremy?

18:18.212 --> 18:20.387
Can we part ways as friends?

18:20.977 --> 18:22.571
I cannot.

18:23.260 --> 18:24.980
Enjoy the pregnancy stretch

18:24.986 --> 18:26.317
mark creams, Tamra.

18:26.317 --> 18:28.005
They've worked wonders for my thighs.

18:28.011 --> 18:29.551
Jeremy. Jeremy.

18:31.237 --> 18:34.407
Remember, this is the
happiest you will be

18:34.407 --> 18:37.037
- for quite some time.
- Oh, my God.

18:37.530 --> 18:39.957
Danny, you haven't
said a word all night.

18:39.957 --> 18:41.957
Ma, do you know how embarrassing it was

18:41.957 --> 18:43.707
to be thrown out of my old hospital?

18:43.707 --> 18:45.167
You know who gets
thrown out of hospitals?

18:45.167 --> 18:47.047
Baby kidnappers. Drug addicts.

18:47.047 --> 18:49.627
The occasional Make-A-Wish
celebrity who's too drunk.

18:49.627 --> 18:52.377
- Look, I love you.
- Mm-hmm.

18:52.377 --> 18:54.082
All right, and I don't want you

18:54.088 --> 18:55.677
to take this the wrong way.

18:55.677 --> 18:57.913
But you are not good in a crisis.

18:57.919 --> 18:59.517
Not good in a crisis?
What are you talking about?

18:59.517 --> 19:01.057
I deliver babies every day.

19:01.057 --> 19:02.937
I Heimlich'd a pilot on an airplane.

19:02.937 --> 19:04.557
Everyone clapped.
They gave me a pin, Ma.

19:04.557 --> 19:06.517
Yeah, well, you're a wonderful doctor.

19:06.517 --> 19:08.357
When the patient isn't your mother.

19:08.357 --> 19:10.687
With me, you're a bit too intense.

19:10.687 --> 19:12.397
Too intense? My ma is sick.

19:12.397 --> 19:14.407
I would never forgive
myself if I didn't spend

19:14.407 --> 19:16.367
every waking hour worrying about it,

19:16.367 --> 19:18.577
making sure everybody else
was worrying about it too.

19:18.577 --> 19:21.327
You see, that was very intense.

19:21.327 --> 19:23.667
- Who are you shouting at?
- I don't know.

19:23.667 --> 19:26.587
I don't know, Ma. The cancer, I guess.

19:30.087 --> 19:31.917
The fact that you worked
hard your whole life

19:31.917 --> 19:33.377
and this is what you get?

19:35.797 --> 19:38.257
That I can't do anything to stop it.

19:38.257 --> 19:39.887
I don't know. It's just...

19:42.047 --> 19:43.405
It's unfair.

19:44.187 --> 19:46.109
It's unfair. It is.

19:46.281 --> 19:48.631
But, look.

19:49.937 --> 19:52.607
We don't need to make
our own storm clouds.

19:53.123 --> 19:54.782
God does that.

19:54.947 --> 19:57.527
I need more rays of light.

20:04.067 --> 20:06.077
So, you really shot off your toe

20:06.077 --> 20:08.167
to get out of going with me?

20:08.167 --> 20:10.457
Well, Daddy would have been proud.

20:10.621 --> 20:12.603
That's how he got out of Vietnam.

20:12.908 --> 20:15.127
Oh, oh, good.

20:15.127 --> 20:17.637
I was so worried you were gonna be mad.

20:17.637 --> 20:19.297
I was.

20:19.297 --> 20:20.927
But now I'm more sad than anything.

20:20.927 --> 20:22.557
I'm sad that we're gonna be apart.

20:22.557 --> 20:24.427
I remember from the
moment you were born,

20:24.427 --> 20:26.477
I thought, "This little baby's
gonna be my best friend."

20:26.477 --> 20:28.227
And that got weird sometimes.

20:28.227 --> 20:29.931
Like when I came back from college

20:29.937 --> 20:32.527
every time you lost a tooth so
I could be the tooth fairy.

20:32.817 --> 20:34.817
- That was you?
- Yeah.

20:35.495 --> 20:37.567
I still have the teeth, too.

20:37.567 --> 20:40.027
I'm gonna miss you too.

20:40.027 --> 20:42.867
But I'm really proud
of what you're doing.

20:42.867 --> 20:44.596
Well, that means a lot.

20:45.122 --> 20:46.733
Say, now that Morgan's getting married,

20:46.739 --> 20:48.377
you're gonna need a place to live.

20:48.377 --> 20:51.167
Dr. L said I could sleep on
the floor of her kitchen

20:51.167 --> 20:53.417
if I cook and clean for her.

20:53.417 --> 20:55.217
Like Cinderella, she said.

20:55.383 --> 20:57.343
Why don't you just live here?

20:57.349 --> 20:59.427
I didn't renovate a 17-room townhouse

20:59.427 --> 21:02.137
so some Russian billionaire's
daughter can live in it

21:02.137 --> 21:04.286
while she interns at "The Daily Show."

21:05.288 --> 21:08.517
Oh, my God. Me?

21:08.517 --> 21:11.017
Living here?

21:11.017 --> 21:14.527
I'll be, like, the only lesbian
on the Upper East Side.

21:14.527 --> 21:16.447
I am going to clean up.

21:16.447 --> 21:18.237
I expect you will, Colette.

21:27.207 --> 21:30.207
Well, apart from Jody's emotional detour

21:30.207 --> 21:32.587
and Mindy burning her
breasts in the fondue pot,

21:32.754 --> 21:35.214
I thought that was a pretty
successful braby shower.

21:35.220 --> 21:37.174
Huh. Oh, really?

21:37.712 --> 21:40.140
I don't. I think you ruined my party.

21:40.140 --> 21:42.877
I assumed it was going to
get ruined, but not by you.

21:43.350 --> 21:45.060
When I first left for America,

21:45.060 --> 21:47.650
Father didn't talk to me for 20 years.

21:47.650 --> 21:49.900
The Reed family holds
grudges for generations.

21:49.900 --> 21:51.270
I'm just getting started.

21:51.270 --> 21:53.650
You need to calm down, Jeremy.

21:53.650 --> 21:55.990
- We can find another doctor.
- Yeah, fine.

21:55.990 --> 21:58.116
But how am I gonna find another...

21:58.990 --> 22:00.620
Oh, my God.

22:02.120 --> 22:03.625
I've been a fool.

22:05.483 --> 22:07.580
Thank you.

22:33.369 --> 22:34.702
- Jeremy?
- Jody.

22:35.053 --> 22:36.615
I want to apologize.

22:36.678 --> 22:38.598
I guess I thought it would be easier

22:38.598 --> 22:41.148
to stay mad at you than say goodbye.

22:41.148 --> 22:43.688
But there's something I've
always wanted to confess.

22:43.688 --> 22:45.818
Oh, are you sure?

22:45.818 --> 22:48.198
Some genies you can't
go back in the bottle.

22:48.198 --> 22:49.385
Jody.

22:49.805 --> 22:51.358
You're my best friend.

22:51.608 --> 22:53.554
- Is that it?
- Yeah, that's it.

22:53.560 --> 22:55.940
Oh, well, you're my best friend too.

22:55.946 --> 22:57.591
I didn't want you to go.

22:57.599 --> 22:59.849
I didn't want to live in a
world where male friendship

22:59.849 --> 23:02.979
was less important than
work or... or romantic love.

23:03.161 --> 23:04.675
It is important.

23:04.681 --> 23:06.561
I don't think I would have
been able to leave without

23:06.567 --> 23:08.302
knowing you had someone
here to take care of you.

23:08.308 --> 23:11.058
Roger? No, Roger's got a girlfriend now.

23:11.064 --> 23:12.802
- We barely talk.
- No, Anna.

23:12.808 --> 23:13.944
- Oh.
- You two are perfect

23:13.950 --> 23:15.444
for each other, and it made me feel

23:15.450 --> 23:16.725
like you were in good hands.

23:16.731 --> 23:18.321
In good, cold hands.

23:18.327 --> 23:20.577
I bet she's home waiting
for you right now.

23:20.583 --> 23:22.427
Yeah. I suppose you're right.

23:23.796 --> 23:26.308
Well, goodbye, Jody. Be safe.

23:27.227 --> 23:28.681
Jambo.

23:33.448 --> 23:36.408
Best friends? What about me?

23:36.501 --> 23:38.950
Well, as a good friend
of mine once said,

23:38.956 --> 23:41.326
"Best friend isn't
a person. It's a tier."

23:41.639 --> 23:43.102
Get in here.

23:50.891 --> 23:52.431
- Hey.
- Hey.

23:52.437 --> 23:54.147
You just missed Leo. I put him to bed.

23:54.369 --> 23:55.869
We just read our nightly chapter

23:55.869 --> 23:57.329
from Holly Madison's autobiography.

23:57.329 --> 23:58.612
Holly Madison?

23:58.618 --> 24:00.538
What happened to "The
Red Badge of Courage?"

24:00.544 --> 24:02.932
I threw it at a neighbor who
was playing the trumpet.

24:05.009 --> 24:06.920
Uh, do you... Would you mind

24:06.926 --> 24:08.479
if I came in and had a beer?

24:08.969 --> 24:11.719
Sure, yeah. Come on in.

24:11.719 --> 24:13.429
Thanks.

24:13.429 --> 24:16.599
I think I have a
SkinnyBitch IPA in there.

24:16.599 --> 24:18.849
Oh, this Dr. Dan's will do.

24:18.849 --> 24:22.269
Oktoberfest, now this was a good batch.

24:26.439 --> 24:28.939
Mmm. Good stuff.

24:29.449 --> 24:32.829
Oh, you got, uh, new kitchen towels.

24:32.829 --> 24:34.406
Stop stalling.

24:34.412 --> 24:35.914
What do you wanna tell me?

24:37.040 --> 24:39.420
Yeah, I talked to, uh, Dr. Richlin.

24:39.426 --> 24:42.266
And, uh, he said the chemo's going okay,

24:42.339 --> 24:44.084
but he wants to do a double

24:44.090 --> 24:45.959
mastectomy just to be safe.

24:45.959 --> 24:47.379
And Ma said yes.

24:49.129 --> 24:50.926
Well, I think that's a good idea.

24:50.932 --> 24:52.762
Look, I know you think I'm annoying

24:52.768 --> 24:54.318
and I'm not taking your
mom's treatment seriously,

24:54.324 --> 24:55.784
but I really care about her.

24:56.019 --> 24:57.693
And after her surgery,

24:57.699 --> 24:59.253
I would love to give her a care

24:59.259 --> 25:01.249
package or send her something.

25:02.019 --> 25:04.609
- I want you to be there.
- What?

25:05.622 --> 25:07.412
You have a good effect on Ma.

25:09.653 --> 25:10.983
And on me.

25:12.819 --> 25:14.975
I have a good effect on you?

25:15.409 --> 25:16.739
You heard what I said.

25:23.858 --> 25:25.689
Hello, Mindy. Listen,
I wanted to thank you

25:25.695 --> 25:27.568
for defending my honor last night.

25:27.568 --> 25:28.859
I think you have the makings

25:28.865 --> 25:30.288
of a fine southern gentleman.

25:30.294 --> 25:31.554
Well, that's very nice.

25:31.662 --> 25:33.780
- I actually do own a spittoon.
- Ooh.

25:34.563 --> 25:37.247
I just wanted to say that
I'm really gonna miss you.

25:37.253 --> 25:38.828
It's been really nice

25:38.828 --> 25:41.078
starting a business with
you and being your friend.

25:41.078 --> 25:43.628
Well, I am touched that
you think that, Mindy.

25:43.628 --> 25:45.668
And on the subject of our business,

25:45.668 --> 25:47.758
since I won't be drawing salary
at Physicians on the Front,

25:47.758 --> 25:49.548
I'll need to pull my equity
out of "Later, Baby"

25:49.548 --> 25:52.758
- as soon as possible.
- What? Pull your equity?

25:52.758 --> 25:54.348
That's a ton of money, Jody.

25:54.348 --> 25:56.705
We need that to survive as a business.

25:56.711 --> 25:58.642
Why don't you sell your giant apartment?

25:58.648 --> 26:01.226
I already gave it to Colette.
I had to leave her something.

26:01.232 --> 26:03.282
But I have faith that
you'll figure this out.

26:03.282 --> 26:05.822
New York has taught me that
women can do anything.

26:05.822 --> 26:08.532
So, good luck, fellow feminist.
