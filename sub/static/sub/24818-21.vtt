09:26.033 --> 09:29.067
- Alright, we do have some
time for fan questions.

09:29.169 --> 09:31.369
This is from @HaisleyLanley.

09:31.471 --> 09:34.539
"How frustrating is that people
constantly forget that you are

09:34.641 --> 09:37.709
real people with real lives
and real problems?"

09:37.811 --> 09:40.045
- The thing that annoys me the
most is they're always like

09:40.147 --> 09:41.479
making comments
like, "You're so negative,

09:41.582 --> 09:42.914
you're so this,
you're so that."

09:43.016 --> 09:44.816
I'm like those five minutes
you saw or five seconds

09:44.918 --> 09:47.085
that you saw me shouldn't
dictate what you think

09:47.187 --> 09:48.587
how my actual life is.

09:48.689 --> 09:52.691
And that goes for everybody on
the show like...they forget.

09:52.793 --> 09:56.394
- Like a lot of this season
showed me not being with my kids

09:56.496 --> 09:59.197
and, literally, just going
on trips with my friends.

09:59.299 --> 10:00.765
But they didn't show me
changing diapers,

10:00.867 --> 10:02.300
didn't show me getting
them ready for school.

10:02.402 --> 10:03.535
It didn't show any of that.

10:03.637 --> 10:05.537
And you know, people don't
get to see everything.

10:05.639 --> 10:07.606
- What you have to say
about me shouldn't affect me,

10:07.708 --> 10:09.941
so the block button
is my favorite.

10:10.043 --> 10:11.176
- Hello.

10:11.278 --> 10:13.878
- Like block, block,
block, block, I don't care.

10:13.981 --> 10:15.780
If you think that I'm
hiding from it, I'm not.

10:15.882 --> 10:18.316
I just rather not--
- Oh, I hate when they say that.

10:18.418 --> 10:20.619
- I'd just rather not
see your negativity. For what?

10:20.721 --> 10:23.421
I'm trying to preserve wrinkles.
Did you see me on that live?

10:23.523 --> 10:25.223
Did you see me on that live?
No wrinkles.

10:25.325 --> 10:27.125
You know why? Because I don't
let your negativity come

10:27.227 --> 10:28.493
and affect me, so that's it.

10:28.595 --> 10:30.462
- Keep the glow up.
I like the glow up.

10:30.564 --> 10:32.464
We have another
question from Facebook.

10:32.566 --> 10:37.402
TonyHun, "Is Barbara single
and ready to mingle?"

10:37.504 --> 10:38.603
- Sis.

10:38.705 --> 10:41.206
- Yes, I'm single,
and I'm never mingling.

10:41.308 --> 10:43.008
- ALL: [laughing]

10:43.110 --> 10:44.909
- I'm never dating again.

10:45.012 --> 10:47.746
- Did you try any
Internet dating, dating apps?

10:47.848 --> 10:50.515
- I don't wanna date.
I--I'm at 66 now.

10:50.617 --> 10:54.619
I do not want a man around me.
- What about a woman?

10:54.721 --> 10:57.255
- BARBARA: No!
- [audience laughing]

10:57.357 --> 10:59.591
- And we have some questions
from the audience.

10:59.693 --> 11:02.661
Step on up, tell us your name,
where you're from,

11:02.763 --> 11:03.828
and give us your question.

11:03.930 --> 11:06.331
- Hi, my name is Lorave,
and I'm from New Jersey.

11:06.433 --> 11:08.066
My question is for Jenelle.

11:08.168 --> 11:11.036
So, Kail said that she should
write you a check for burning

11:11.138 --> 11:13.304
her haircare products
on social media.

11:13.407 --> 11:15.273
Do you regret posting that
because it helped her

11:15.375 --> 11:17.208
more than it hurt her?

11:17.310 --> 11:21.613
- No, I mean, honestly, I have
my own little projects going on.

11:21.715 --> 11:24.949
I don't just take my name and
slap it on a product either.

11:25.052 --> 11:28.286
I take my time to, you
know--take a year to come out

11:28.388 --> 11:33.058
with my plan and my kit, but you
know, she--she said that she

11:33.160 --> 11:35.960
sent it to all the girls, and
she didn't send it to Briana.

11:36.063 --> 11:40.432
So, I mean, it's kinda talking
out of her ass in that scene.

11:40.534 --> 11:41.966
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

11:42.069 --> 11:44.502
- DR. DREW: Jenelle, again,
thank you for coming back out.

11:44.604 --> 11:45.904
Barb will be sticking around.

11:46.006 --> 11:47.872
And after the break,
we will get Nathan's take

11:47.974 --> 11:49.441
on the custody battle
for Kaiser.

11:49.543 --> 11:51.309
Plus, long last, we will speak

11:51.411 --> 11:54.946
with Jace's estranged father,
Andrew. Don't go away.

11:55.048 --> 12:00.385
- [audience applause]

12:00.487 --> 12:03.088
- You can't just show
up one day and say,

12:03.190 --> 12:04.556
"Hi, I'm your father."

12:04.658 --> 12:06.958
And then not see him
again for two years.

12:07.060 --> 12:08.993
- ♪

12:13.500 --> 12:16.568
- [audience applause]

12:16.670 --> 12:19.170
- Welcome back to
"The Teen Mom 2 Finale Special."

12:19.272 --> 12:22.373
Dr. Drew and I are now here
with Barb and Nathan.

12:22.476 --> 12:25.477
- [audience applause]

12:25.579 --> 12:26.511
- Nathan, how's Kaiser doing?

12:26.613 --> 12:27.612
- Awesome.

12:27.714 --> 12:28.947
Enjoy life.

12:29.049 --> 12:31.316
- You said you'd be better
off having primary custody.

12:31.418 --> 12:32.617
- I believe so.
- Why?

12:32.719 --> 12:35.386
- Because I think I have
a lot more one-on-one attention.

12:35.489 --> 12:38.690
I mean, over there, you know,
there's four kids...

12:38.792 --> 12:40.525
over there constantly.
- Three.

12:40.627 --> 12:41.893
- Three.

12:41.995 --> 12:44.529
I just think there's a lot of
things I disagree with that

12:44.631 --> 12:46.865
Kaiser deals with over there.

12:46.967 --> 12:48.767
- Is some of that due
to concern about David?

12:48.869 --> 12:50.368
- Yes, 100%.

12:50.470 --> 12:52.070
- Barbara, you concern?

12:52.172 --> 12:54.706
- I think everything's
going alright over there.

12:54.808 --> 12:57.709
He's just a rough and tumble
boy, oh my god, he's like,

12:57.811 --> 13:00.178
you know--he seems
to be doing fine.

13:00.280 --> 13:03.615
- What about Nathan's
desire to be more involved?

13:03.717 --> 13:05.383
- Well, Nathan lives--he
should be more involved,

13:05.485 --> 13:06.885
but you live so far away.

13:06.987 --> 13:08.286
He lives in Florida.

13:08.388 --> 13:11.322
- And you've said you might
rethink living in Florida?

13:11.424 --> 13:14.559
- Oh, 100%, I mean, like I'm
not gonna pull a child

13:14.661 --> 13:16.027
away from his mother.

13:16.129 --> 13:19.030
Like I still would want Jenelle
to be 100% involved in his life.

13:19.132 --> 13:22.333
And like but--even when
it comes to phone calls,

13:22.435 --> 13:25.036
like there are sometimes I just
wanna pick up the phone

13:25.138 --> 13:27.338
and call and make sure
Kaiser's doing okay.

13:27.440 --> 13:30.508
And she has severed that tie.
I can't communicate.

13:30.610 --> 13:32.043
I don't know if
it's because of her.

13:32.145 --> 13:33.545
I don't know if it's
because of David.

13:33.647 --> 13:35.613
I don't know, but I have no
communication with my son,

13:35.715 --> 13:36.948
only on the weekends.

13:37.050 --> 13:39.417
- Are you having a problem
with David? You personally?

13:39.519 --> 13:41.719
I mean, has something got worse?

13:41.822 --> 13:44.522
- I can't hold a civil
conversation with that guy

13:44.624 --> 13:46.257
acting like a banshee.

13:46.359 --> 13:48.793
Like he is just a crazy animal.

13:48.895 --> 13:51.196
- Okay, well, this season
a familiar face made

13:51.298 --> 13:53.865
an unexpected return
to Jenelle's life.

13:53.967 --> 13:56.568
That is Jace's dad, Andrew.

13:56.670 --> 13:57.802
He is here tonight.

13:57.904 --> 13:59.504
You've never met him,
is that right, Nathan?

13:59.606 --> 14:00.538
- I haven't.

14:00.640 --> 14:02.273
- And here he is.
Let's welcome Andrew.

14:02.375 --> 14:04.075
- [audience applause]

14:09.983 --> 14:12.083
- What's up, bud? Doing good?

14:12.185 --> 14:13.518
- How are you?
- Pleasure.

14:13.620 --> 14:17.088
- Hi, Andrew. Hi.
- Hi, Andrew.

14:17.190 --> 14:18.990
- When was
the last time I saw you?

14:19.092 --> 14:21.226
- Reunion--first
reunion, I think.

14:21.328 --> 14:24.028
- That's what I think
it was, like way back.

14:24.130 --> 14:26.130
So, you've not really been
involved with Jace

14:26.233 --> 14:28.967
all this time?
- I have tried, you know?

14:29.069 --> 14:31.269
Nathan, you know--there's
been times whenever they were

14:31.371 --> 14:33.271
together, I would text.
He knows.

14:33.373 --> 14:35.840
I would text Jenelle, and she
would just say

14:35.942 --> 14:37.342
"leave me alone" and stuff.

14:37.444 --> 14:38.943
I just wanna call
and see about Jace.

14:39.045 --> 14:42.580
It's come to the point now
where I want--it's my son, man,

14:42.682 --> 14:44.215
come on, you know?

14:44.317 --> 14:46.084
- Well, you can go
through lawyers, man.

14:46.186 --> 14:47.785
I'm not trying to throw you
under the bus,

14:47.888 --> 14:49.587
but if this has to do
with my kids,

14:49.689 --> 14:52.891
I'll fight for hell and high
water to even see them one day

14:52.993 --> 14:54.125
a month if I have to.

14:54.227 --> 14:55.894
If I have to take
supervised visitation,

14:55.996 --> 14:57.762
as long as I have that
one-on-one connection

14:57.864 --> 15:00.932
with my children--like I
couldn't do that.

15:01.034 --> 15:02.667
- Jace doesn't even know him.

15:02.769 --> 15:07.138
You can't just show up one day
and say, "Hi, I'm your father."

15:07.240 --> 15:09.440
And then not see him
again for two years.

15:09.542 --> 15:11.876
I mean, you just can't do that.
- I do agree with that.

15:11.978 --> 15:13.711
- You need to be consistent.

15:13.813 --> 15:15.613
- Have you ever
reached out to Barb?

15:15.715 --> 15:18.750
- Briefly, yes.
I never had her number.

15:18.852 --> 15:21.786
- I've had the same phone
number since Jace has been born.

15:21.888 --> 15:26.257
Jace has never got one card,
one gift,

15:26.359 --> 15:29.193
one phone call, nothing.

15:29.296 --> 15:30.795
- What do you
think's happening?

15:30.897 --> 15:33.965
- I just think that he thinks
about Jace once in a while,

15:34.067 --> 15:36.534
and then he'll go on a whim
and he'll text or whatever,

15:36.636 --> 15:38.002
and then that's that.

15:38.104 --> 15:42.073
If this guy was, you know,
an upstanding citizen, you know,

15:42.175 --> 15:46.177
somebody I could depend on,
it'd be a different story.

15:46.279 --> 15:48.413
- What's been going on for
the last eight years that

15:48.515 --> 15:50.748
it took eight years to
get to this point?

15:50.850 --> 15:51.849
- To this point?

15:51.952 --> 15:54.152
Busting my ass, getting
myself straight.

15:54.254 --> 15:55.420
- What does that mean?

15:55.522 --> 15:57.622
- I--okay, well, I moved
to Los Angeles, California.

15:57.724 --> 15:59.123
Okay, I was modeling
a long time ago.

15:59.225 --> 16:01.559
I said, okay, there's
something--my contract was up,

16:01.661 --> 16:02.961
so I left from there.

16:03.063 --> 16:04.662
And so, I said, "You
know, screw it."

16:04.764 --> 16:07.966
I had a friend
in Los Angeles, California,

16:08.068 --> 16:10.768
so I went to Los Angeles
Community College.

16:10.870 --> 16:12.737
And I transferred, and I got
accepted into the University

16:12.839 --> 16:14.672
of Southern California,
got a bachelor's degree

16:14.774 --> 16:16.107
in cinematic arts.

16:16.209 --> 16:19.978
I said, "I gotta do something."
I--I help feed the homeless.

16:20.080 --> 16:22.313
Here, I even go there
in Christmastime.

16:22.415 --> 16:25.083
- Where'd you go in Los Angeles?
- What do you mean?

16:25.185 --> 16:27.185
- Where did you go to do this
in Los Angeles?

16:27.287 --> 16:29.854
- Just hospitals, random ones.
- No, they won't let you.

16:29.956 --> 16:31.122
- What do you mean?

16:31.224 --> 16:32.957
- It's--it's
the HIPPA violation.

16:33.059 --> 16:35.393
They don't feed the
homeless in hospitals.

16:35.495 --> 16:37.195
- No, no, homeless here--I fed--

16:37.297 --> 16:39.464
- You said you fed the
homeless in Los Angeles.

16:39.566 --> 16:40.598
Where did you go?

16:40.700 --> 16:42.500
- On the streets
and everything.

16:42.602 --> 16:44.936
I walked--literally,
I would walk,

16:45.038 --> 16:46.637
and if somebody was
there that was homeless,

16:46.740 --> 16:49.574
I would literally give them
something to eat, sir.

16:49.676 --> 16:52.710
- Last time we spoke to you,
you were having trouble actually

16:52.812 --> 16:55.146
even traveling to--I
think it was New York.

16:55.248 --> 16:57.849
You were forbidden from
coming to New York State.

16:57.951 --> 16:59.550
Or was it--North Carolina.

16:59.652 --> 17:02.920
- Yeah, yeah, because I was
behind on child support

17:03.023 --> 17:04.389
and everything.

17:04.491 --> 17:08.726
And they said if I come to North
Carolina, I would get arrested.

17:08.828 --> 17:11.062
- Because you were behind--
- All that's cleared up now.

17:11.164 --> 17:13.464
- Were you pressing that
issue, or was Jenelle?

17:13.566 --> 17:16.401
- I pressed--I did,
because--and you know what?

17:16.503 --> 17:19.871
I solely support Jace.

17:19.973 --> 17:21.873
I don't get child support
from any--well,

17:21.975 --> 17:23.741
I get a little child support
from him.

17:23.843 --> 17:26.144
- They take it out of
my check, $100 a week.

17:26.246 --> 17:27.412
Every single check--

17:27.514 --> 17:29.380
- Is that trying to pay
back that original debt?

17:29.482 --> 17:32.617
- No, that's giving
her--well, paying about--

17:32.719 --> 17:33.751
- It's the minimum.

17:33.853 --> 17:35.119
- Well, it's alright,
it's something.

17:35.221 --> 17:38.189
- Well, I know that. I mean,
for years, it was nothing.

17:38.291 --> 17:40.258
- So what's going on
with the alcohol now?

17:40.360 --> 17:42.293
- I don't drink anymore.
I don't mess with that.

17:42.395 --> 17:43.728
I'll tell you straight up.

17:43.830 --> 17:45.430
I had my fun when
I was young man.

17:45.532 --> 17:47.165
I had my fun,
a lot of people have

17:47.267 --> 17:48.433
their fun when they're young.

17:48.535 --> 17:50.201
I wasn't deadly addicted,
but I did drink.

17:50.303 --> 17:51.536
But I wasn't deadly addicted.

17:51.638 --> 17:53.738
- How old are you now?
- I'm 33 years old.

17:53.840 --> 17:54.906
- Are you using drugs now?

17:55.008 --> 17:56.974
- No. You wanna give me
a drug test right now,

17:57.077 --> 17:59.110
I'll pass it with flying colors.
I swear to God.

17:59.212 --> 18:00.511
- Wow.

18:00.613 --> 18:04.649
- The one thing I have a concern
with is that--there seems to

18:04.751 --> 18:07.385
be a pattern, because every
person Jenelle has dated--

18:07.487 --> 18:11.189
this person has an alcohol, now
David supposedly has alcohol.

18:11.291 --> 18:12.356
Keifer was an addict.

18:12.459 --> 18:14.425
Whether he was or not,
I don't care, okay?

18:14.527 --> 18:15.626
- It's not my problem.

18:15.728 --> 18:17.795
- So shouldn't she
be a concern, too,

18:17.897 --> 18:19.564
around these children?

18:19.666 --> 18:20.865
That's my only concern.

18:20.967 --> 18:24.001
- My thing is with
Jace--and Jenelle said,

18:24.104 --> 18:26.571
you know--we
discuss it together.

18:26.673 --> 18:28.072
Me and Jenelle
discuss it together,

18:28.174 --> 18:31.642
but it's mainly my decision
is I do have custody over him.

18:31.744 --> 18:35.546
But you know, the thing is,
I have to see consistency.

18:35.648 --> 18:37.715
- Consistency of what?
Give me exactly what?

18:37.817 --> 18:40.485
- Consistency of
him calling me--

18:40.587 --> 18:41.752
- On a daily basis?

18:41.855 --> 18:44.355
- Not a daily--oh no.
- ALL: [laughs]

18:44.457 --> 18:45.490
- DR. DREW: A weekly basis?

18:45.592 --> 18:47.391
- Maybe a weekly basis,
or every two weeks,

18:47.494 --> 18:48.826
just calling me up.

18:48.928 --> 18:51.796
You know what grade he's in?
Do you know what grade he's in?

18:51.898 --> 18:52.997
- No, that's the thing.

18:53.099 --> 18:55.099
- No, so he doesn't know
he's in fourth grade.

18:55.201 --> 18:58.069
And do you know Jace
has--takes Latin in school,

18:58.171 --> 18:59.437
and he's acing it.

18:59.539 --> 19:00.605
- DR. DREW: Good for him.

19:00.707 --> 19:03.641
- BARBARA: He's acing
Latin in fourth grade.

19:03.743 --> 19:05.042
I'm so proud of him.

19:05.145 --> 19:08.146
I just don't understand why
we all can't just get along.

19:08.248 --> 19:09.614
- [audience laughs]

19:09.716 --> 19:10.581

19:10.683 --> 19:12.383
- Who's "they all"?
- It's a lot.

19:12.485 --> 19:13.784
- BARBARA: They all, like--

19:13.887 --> 19:16.120
- All the people that Jenelle
have brought into their life?

19:16.222 --> 19:19.123
- BARBARA: All the
baby daddies, right?

19:19.225 --> 19:21.325
- One day, one day, one day.

19:21.427 --> 19:22.393
One day.

19:22.495 --> 19:23.828
- All the families
just get along.

19:23.930 --> 19:24.962
- Wouldn't that be nice?

19:25.064 --> 19:28.266
Okay, we thank you all for
letting us

19:28.368 --> 19:30.334
try to dissect these things.

19:30.436 --> 19:32.036
I'm grateful to have been
a part of it,

19:32.138 --> 19:33.204
so hopefully it goes somewhere.

Nessa, 15 minutes of asking me

in an intimate way, how long do
you wait before you tell them

21:28.388 --> 21:29.920
that you have three kids?

21:30.023 --> 21:32.723
- I think that's something I
should tell them right away.

- Right, right.
- Taking on three kids is a lot.

21:35.395 --> 21:37.795
It's a lot of responsibility,
so I think it's something

21:37.897 --> 21:39.797
you should definitely
tell them upfront.

21:39.899 --> 21:42.199
- Straight away.
- Yeah, straight up.

21:42.302 --> 21:43.901
- Are you guys ready
for some fan questions?

21:44.003 --> 21:45.069

- Yeah.

21:45.171 --> 21:46.570
- This question's from...

21:53.346 --> 21:55.479
- I never really
dated, actually.

21:55.581 --> 21:57.181
I've never been on a real date.

21:57.283 --> 21:58.349

21:58.451 --> 22:00.217
- Weren't you on a dating show?

22:00.320 --> 22:02.787
- It's not the same
as dating, Nessa.

22:02.889 --> 22:05.556
Fifteen minutes and asking me if
I've ever had a threesome does

22:05.658 --> 22:09.660
not constitute [bleep] if
I've been on--as a date.

been--I'm kidding.

22:11.698 --> 22:12.830

22:12.932 --> 22:15.633
- I have never been
texted and like--okay,

22:15.735 --> 22:18.803
the whole process of dating
where it's like, okay, "Hey, um,

22:18.905 --> 22:21.005
"I wanna take you out to dinner.
Let's--I'll pick you up

22:21.107 --> 22:22.540

in a relationship.

never been courted?

- No.
- DR. DREW: Do you wish?

22:28.014 --> 22:30.815
- Yeah. Now I'm 27, I wanna
be [bleep] courted.

22:30.917 --> 22:33.484
- Well, you deserve that.
- You deserve it.

22:33.586 --> 22:34.985

- Yeah.

22:37.357 --> 22:38.923

had you been on dates?

talk for a little while,

22:42.962 --> 22:44.161
and then I expect them.

22:44.263 --> 22:46.497
Like I know what I
want, so I want a date.

22:46.599 --> 22:50.000
I wanna be courted, I wanted to
be treat--treated right, so yes.

22:50.103 --> 22:51.736
- Okay, Kail,
look, it's alright.

22:51.838 --> 22:52.937
Learn from it.

22:53.039 --> 22:55.106
Get these dates get courted.
- Okay.

22:55.208 --> 22:56.874
- Leah can coach you up.
- That's right.

22:56.976 --> 22:58.576
- Great.
- NESSA: [laughs]

22:58.678 --> 23:00.277

questions from the audience.

23:00.380 --> 23:01.846
What is your name?
Where are you from?

23:01.948 --> 23:03.781
- Hi, my name is Katie
from New Jersey.

23:03.883 --> 23:06.183
I wanted to know if you
think it would easier to date

23:06.285 --> 23:09.620
someone who has kids
of their own or not.

23:09.722 --> 23:11.255
- Kail, what do you think?

23:11.357 --> 23:15.159
- Based on my experience of
going back to the baby mom

23:15.261 --> 23:18.896
and--no, I'm not gonna put
myself in a situation.

23:18.998 --> 23:21.365
I know it sounds hypocritical,
and I know I sound crazy,

23:21.467 --> 23:25.603
but no, I wouldn't date someone
that has kids, I don't think.

23:25.705 --> 23:27.505
- Next question
come on down here.

23:27.607 --> 23:28.906
- Hi, my name is Kiara.

23:29.008 --> 23:30.374
I'm from Connecticut.

23:30.476 --> 23:34.612
And my question is: Is there a
way you can tell a guy would be

23:34.714 --> 23:37.815
a good dad when you first meet?
- Mm.

23:37.917 --> 23:39.850
- I think stability,
number one.

23:39.952 --> 23:42.119
Like does he have a house and
things like that--or a job?

23:42.221 --> 23:44.288
- BOTH: [laughs]

23:44.390 --> 23:47.591
- Listen, don't count--don't
count them out just

23:47.693 --> 23:51.395
'cause they don't have a job.
- No, Kail.

23:51.497 --> 23:53.664
- How are they gonna take care
of us if they don't--

23:53.766 --> 23:55.633
- But maybe they're
a stay-at-home dad.

23:55.735 --> 23:57.768
- What?
- No, no, no, no.

23:57.870 --> 23:59.503
- Okay, so it
that--okay, let me ask--

23:59.605 --> 24:00.871
- I'm open to a
stay-at-home dad.

24:00.973 --> 24:03.941
- So you're--okay.
This is good, we're learning.

24:04.043 --> 24:06.710
- I have an alpha personality,
so...it's fine if I'm

24:06.813 --> 24:08.078
the breadwinner, and I'm
paying the bills.

24:08.181 --> 24:09.613
It's fine, then you can
cook and clean

24:09.715 --> 24:10.915
and take care of the kids.

24:12.585 --> 24:14.518
- Alright, let's get
our next question in here.

24:14.620 --> 24:17.755
- Hello, my name is Jessica.
And I'm from The Bronx.

24:17.857 --> 24:21.959
Because you are on TV, do you
think about or worry that people

24:22.061 --> 24:23.828
might date you
because of your fame?

24:23.930 --> 24:25.396
- BOTH: Oh for sure.

24:25.498 --> 24:26.797
- Javi definitely did.

24:26.899 --> 24:28.332
- ALL: [laughing]

24:28.434 --> 24:30.968
- Because he got picked for a
different show on MTV

24:31.070 --> 24:33.871
before he met me,
and the girl said no.

24:33.973 --> 24:36.040
So, it was like so convenient
that all the sudden you're

24:36.142 --> 24:37.975
running into my job at the mall.

24:38.077 --> 24:39.410
- Who's the other girl?

24:39.512 --> 24:41.312
- I don't know if
I could say her name,

24:41.414 --> 24:44.415
but it was for a true life show
about getting back with your ex,

24:44.517 --> 24:47.751
and she didn't want any parts.
- Interesting.

24:49.255 --> 24:51.422
It's rough out here.
Struggle's real.

24:51.524 --> 24:53.424
The struggle is real.

24:53.526 --> 24:55.793
Listen, ladies, thank you
so much for being here today.

sat out here, and you said,

25:34.867 --> 25:37.201
we need to get some
cognitive behavioral therapy."

25:37.303 --> 25:38.802
Did you get some CBT?

25:38.905 --> 25:40.504
- Hell no, I don't got
no health insurance,

what I did was wrong.

- But?

- --that's my sister.

25:47.213 --> 25:48.812
- Let's just stay
with it for a second.

25:48.915 --> 25:51.815
So I have noticed a little
bit of an attitude change.

25:51.918 --> 25:53.450
I wondered if you'd gotten CBT.

25:53.553 --> 25:55.185
You're saying you have not.
- No.

25:55.288 --> 25:56.587
- Growth.
- DR. DREW: Growth.

25:56.689 --> 25:58.856
- It's called watching myself
yank somebody on national TV,

25:58.958 --> 26:00.958
and me being like, "I'm not
trying to get arrested."

26:01.060 --> 26:03.460
- But there was another piece
here, too, that I got on Briana

26:03.563 --> 26:05.262
about that I think is a little
bit unforgivable,

26:05.364 --> 26:07.164
which is a pregnant woman
was on this stage--

26:07.266 --> 26:09.466
- Dr. Drew, I know
I'm on this show.

26:09.569 --> 26:12.069
But I don't watch the show.
- But now you do know.

26:12.171 --> 26:13.771
- Yeah, now I do know, but
I didn't--

26:13.873 --> 26:15.539
- Did you make
an apology to her?

26:15.641 --> 26:17.841
- I told my sister, I was
like, "Oh damn, I'm sorry."

26:17.944 --> 26:21.779
But I don't talk to them, like--
- Maybe you should, just saying.

26:21.881 --> 26:23.681
- Maybe, but I have
nothing against any of 'em.

26:23.783 --> 26:25.482
Yes, I pulled Kail's
hair, I'm sorry.

26:25.585 --> 26:28.419
But at the same time, it's like
I'm an older sister

26:28.521 --> 26:32.022
who the screw got loose
when she saw someone

26:32.124 --> 26:33.991
disrespecting
her little baby sister.

I don't condone that.

- DR. DREW: I'm sure.
- Oh, she was pissed.

26:38.230 --> 26:39.096
She was pissed.

26:39.198 --> 26:40.431
We went back
to my aunt's house--

26:40.533 --> 26:42.132
- They're lucky I wasn't here,
because I would've

26:42.234 --> 26:43.734
yanked both their hairs.

the answer either.

was complaining about something
that happened at a pool party.

what it was that she was
feeling, but it was wrong.

27:19.271 --> 27:21.071
She saw--I saw
disappointment in her,

27:21.173 --> 27:23.507
but she couldn't say alcohol.

27:23.609 --> 27:25.843
She couldn't identify what
it was that she witnessed.

But I'm gonna have
to tell you,

27:27.313 --> 27:29.079
thank God that Briana
came when she came.

27:29.181 --> 27:32.850
Had Briana waited 20 minutes for
Nova to have really seen you

like--and she did see
you like that in the car.

27:36.555 --> 27:37.488
That's sad.

27:37.590 --> 27:40.624
But most importantly,
you, your health.

drinking to that extent.

27:44.597 --> 27:48.032
When you black out,
those are warning signs.

27:48.134 --> 27:49.733
And you need to
identify with that,

27:49.835 --> 27:52.069
and figure out where you
wanna go in your life,

27:52.171 --> 27:53.971

you go down that route.

event in his life has been

around substances.

- It's--it's
telling me something.

28:05.317 --> 28:07.051
And, Devoin, I've seen
you come a long way.

28:07.153 --> 28:10.120
And Briana's right,
you can do more.

28:10.222 --> 28:12.589
But I'm happy to have seen you

28:12.692 --> 28:14.024
do the things
that you are doing.

And I'm not gonna take
that away from you.

And I'll say this, it took us
seven years to get where

28:18.531 --> 28:21.632
we're at, there's more
work to be done.

28:24.704 --> 28:26.804
- Can we talk about
something else?

28:28.974 --> 28:30.641
to stick by my sister's side.

The proof is in the pudding.

I'm just here to tell you what
I'm gonna do going forward.

28:45.624 --> 28:48.625
That's all I can do, literally--
- --feel he's genuinely sorry.

28:48.728 --> 28:51.095
- Oh.
- I don't think so.

28:51.197 --> 28:53.363

know is if he--if he's--

- It's all about actions,
I guess, so we'll see.

through all the bull [bleep],

28:58.304 --> 29:00.904
I know they know I'm
a genuine person.

29:01.006 --> 29:04.808

would not be able to sit here

was just as drunk as hell

Whether she's gonna show it to
you guys or not--and I know they

I need you to do a lot more than
just pay $65.

29:21.560 --> 29:24.495
I need you to step up a lot.

29:24.597 --> 29:30.167
But I just need 100% of Devoin,
and I feel like sometimes

29:30.269 --> 29:33.337
I'll get 80, sometimes I'll 50,
sometimes I'll get 20,

29:33.439 --> 29:34.705

I didn't--you know, I was very
down and hard on myself until

I'm here with Lindsie on the set
of Coffee Convos Podcast with

35:23.989 --> 35:26.256
our friends Catelynn and Tyler
from "Teen Mom OG"

35:26.358 --> 35:29.759
and the newest member
of "Teen Mom 2"...

35:29.862 --> 35:31.194
Jade from "Young & Pregnant."

35:31.296 --> 35:34.731
- [audience cheering]

35:34.833 --> 35:36.399
- Yeah, this is
a huge surprise.

35:36.502 --> 35:38.768
We're happy to have you.
- Yeah, I'm happy to be here.

35:38.871 --> 35:40.303
I'm excited. I am nervous.

35:40.405 --> 35:42.906
I had like a little mini
panic attack before I came.

35:43.008 --> 35:45.175
- Were you nervous when they
told you you were gonna be

35:45.277 --> 35:46.977
a part of "Teen Mom 2"?
Did you know--

35:47.079 --> 35:50.113
- [indistinct chatter]

35:50.215 --> 35:52.616
- I didn't know--okay,
I'm at school.

35:52.718 --> 35:54.484
I'm like out on break,
and they're like, "Hey,

35:54.586 --> 35:56.553
we have someone that
we want you to meet."

35:56.655 --> 35:58.188
I was like, "I'm
gonna poop, I'm scared."

35:58.290 --> 35:59.856
- That's me, too,
I'm the same way.

35:59.958 --> 36:02.626
- Kristen came out, and
Jamie--who's my new producer

36:02.728 --> 36:04.861
now--they come out, and they're
like--she was like, "Hi,

36:04.963 --> 36:06.530
I'm Kristen on 'Teen Mom 2.'"

36:06.632 --> 36:08.365
She was like,
"Yeah, so we love you.

36:08.467 --> 36:10.133
"We love your story so much.

36:10.235 --> 36:12.102
Would you like to
be on the show?"

36:12.204 --> 36:15.672
And I was like, "Okay."

36:15.774 --> 36:18.441
I was like--'cause it's so--the
show'd been on so long that I

36:18.544 --> 36:20.944
can't believe that they would
want me on a show that's been on

36:21.046 --> 36:22.479
for like ten years with
these same people--

36:22.581 --> 36:23.813
- I had the same thoughts.

36:23.916 --> 36:27.984
Not you--against you, but I
was like--it's not broken,

36:28.086 --> 36:30.287
so don't fix it.
- See, that was my same thought.

36:30.389 --> 36:32.789
I don't wanna step on people's
toes. I don't like that.

36:32.891 --> 36:34.591
And she was like,
"No, we want you here.

36:34.693 --> 36:35.859
"We're asking you to be here.

36:35.961 --> 36:37.761
"We're giving you this
opportunity, we love your story.

36:37.863 --> 36:40.564
We would like you to do this."

36:40.666 --> 36:42.866
- We have talked about it on
other podcasts about my mom

36:42.968 --> 36:44.301
struggling with addiction.

36:44.403 --> 36:49.105
And I know that there is news
that your mom has been arrested.

36:49.208 --> 36:51.675
This is still kinda new to you,
and probably to her, too.

36:51.777 --> 36:55.879
So, having that type of like
sensitive stuff going on

36:55.981 --> 36:57.581
in the media is really hard.

36:57.683 --> 37:00.317
- In my new season, uh,
actually both of my parents

37:00.419 --> 37:02.652
were just incarcerated.

37:02.754 --> 37:04.487
They've been strung
out for like so long,

37:04.590 --> 37:07.791
and they're like binge addicts
to where like they'll binge,

37:07.893 --> 37:09.125
and then they'll be okay--

37:09.228 --> 37:11.728
- That's how--exactly.
- Then it's like a fairytale for

37:11.830 --> 37:14.331
like a month, like I have my mom
back, I had my mommy.

37:14.433 --> 37:17.100
- --the last time that I--well,
the first time I met you,

37:17.202 --> 37:19.536
I had seen you in the elevator,
you were in a good place

37:19.638 --> 37:20.804
with her, and things were great.

37:20.906 --> 37:24.241
- It's how it always is,
and it's like it hurts,

37:24.343 --> 37:26.543
because I'm like I've grown up,
and I don't have like--I haven't

37:26.645 --> 37:28.545
had my mom there.
- It's horrible.

37:28.647 --> 37:32.882
- Like my heart was hurting,
because my real dad--I'm sorry.

37:32.985 --> 37:36.519
My real dad committed suicide
when I was six months old.

37:36.622 --> 37:38.822
And that was the only
death I've ever known.

37:38.924 --> 37:40.257
I'm so sorry.

37:40.359 --> 37:42.626
I feel like my real dad never
loved me enough to stay.

37:42.728 --> 37:45.528
And now I feel like even I have
a second chance at a father,

37:45.631 --> 37:48.999
and I feel like he never loved
me enough to stay clean.

37:49.101 --> 37:51.568
- But I think that even
through all of that, it speaks

37:51.670 --> 37:54.504
volumes that you didn't go down
that path as well.

37:54.606 --> 37:57.007
You should really commend
yourself for that and know that

37:57.109 --> 37:59.609
you're doing everything that you
can to be the total opposite

37:59.711 --> 38:00.777
of what you were given.

38:00.879 --> 38:03.747
- My mom isn't even the
woman--like the strong,

38:03.849 --> 38:06.082
beautiful woman that raised me.

38:06.184 --> 38:08.885
It's like I look at this hollow
shell of like a monster

38:08.987 --> 38:11.388
that the drugs created.

38:11.490 --> 38:13.690
And they're filming me,
and I sat on the phone,

38:13.792 --> 38:14.824
I broke down in the car.

38:14.926 --> 38:17.060
And I was like I just
want my mom back.

38:17.162 --> 38:19.095
I want my mommy.

38:19.197 --> 38:20.530
I never had her there.

38:20.632 --> 38:22.766
- One thing me and Cate
have learned is that boundaries

38:22.868 --> 38:24.567
are the most important things,
especially with parents

38:24.670 --> 38:27.203
who have addicts--
- They have no boundaries.

38:27.306 --> 38:29.673
- They don't know 'em,
so we have to force them.

38:29.775 --> 38:31.341
- They can be so hard.

38:31.443 --> 38:33.310
- This is something
Catelyn and Tyler and I and

38:33.412 --> 38:35.312
Lindsie have all talked
about on the podcast before.

38:35.414 --> 38:36.880
It's like I struggle
with that, too.

38:36.982 --> 38:42.619
Like do I have my mom in
my life and set boundaries?

38:42.721 --> 38:44.354
Or do I just
completely cut her off?

38:44.456 --> 38:48.058
- Every year, I'm like do I cut
her [bleep] off and say bye, do

38:48.160 --> 38:52.329
I keep trying to make this
work, and keep hurting myself?

38:52.431 --> 38:55.732
- --really do, if you can cut
'em off and feel really peaceful

38:55.834 --> 38:58.735
and whole and honest about that
situation and that decision and

38:58.837 --> 39:03.106
feel really good about it,
then that--that's great.

39:03.208 --> 39:06.042
I wish I had that power to do
that. I don't, so--

39:06.144 --> 39:09.245
- I wish I had the power to do
what y'all do, because I don't.

39:09.348 --> 39:11.614
To me, it's almost like what
I don't know doesn't hurt me.

39:11.717 --> 39:14.451
- If I didn't go through all
of this [bleep] growing up,

39:14.553 --> 39:18.588
all of this pain and misery
as a child and like hurting

39:18.690 --> 39:20.824
over like addiction and all
the stuff I went through,

39:20.926 --> 39:23.293
it wouldn't have made me
who I am today, so, I mean,

39:23.395 --> 39:27.197
I could come out like the
strong person I am, so--

39:27.299 --> 39:28.331
- You're doing
the right thing.

39:28.433 --> 39:30.066
And we're all happy to have you.

39:30.168 --> 39:33.770
- Well, I wanna give you a very
warm welcome from Coffee Convos.

39:33.872 --> 39:34.904
And I'm sure that--

39:35.006 --> 39:37.841
- And "Teen Mom 2,"
"Teen Mom OG." Welcome.

39:37.943 --> 39:40.577
- So excited to watch your
story and watch you flourish,

39:40.679 --> 39:43.346
because you are a
special young lady.

39:43.448 --> 39:44.147
- Thank you.

39:44.249 --> 39:45.348
[laughs]

39:45.450 --> 39:47.751
- You guys, so your new
season airs next week.

39:47.853 --> 39:50.120
And it's been ten years.

39:50.222 --> 39:53.022
- Yeah, and it's actually
a two-hour premiere.

39:53.125 --> 39:54.090
- That's exciting.

39:54.192 --> 39:55.725
You guys should be
proud of yourselves.

39:55.827 --> 40:01.197
- [indistinct chatter]

40:01.299 --> 40:05.034
- And are you pregnant or have
you had the baby yet or what--

40:05.137 --> 40:08.271
- The first couple of episodes,
yeah, I'll be pregnant still.

40:08.373 --> 40:10.407
- Yeah, I think Beta comes
in a couple episodes in.

40:10.509 --> 40:11.508
- Cool.

40:11.610 --> 40:13.676
- We are so excited to see it.

40:13.779 --> 40:15.779
- Awesome. I think that's all
we have time for.

40:15.881 --> 40:17.614
Thank you, Tyler,
Catelyn, and Jade.

40:17.716 --> 40:19.883
And a huge thank you

and we'll see you next time.
