<i>You are what you are
when you are who you are</i>

01:47.173 --> 01:49.664
<i>You are what you are</i>

01:50.610 --> 01:53.602
<i>You know what you are
when you are who you are</i>

01:53.680 --> 01:55.113
<i>where you are</i>

01:56.216 --> 01:58.616
<i>lt's al about you</i>

02:00.987 --> 02:02.545
Oh, motherfucker.

02:06.126 --> 02:07.115
Wow. Hey.

02:08.794 --> 02:10.262
Look who's here.

02:11.998 --> 02:13.226
Finally.

02:13.299 --> 02:15.733
Look at her. Her own business now.

02:16.302 --> 02:19.328
I've got some radio ties
to help with our Mondays and Tuesdays...

02:19.405 --> 02:22.374
plus I'm thinking about
adding some contests later on.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.610
Glenlivet, right, Ton'?

02:25.612 --> 02:27.273
Just seltzer, dear.

02:27.947 --> 02:29.346
Christopher here?

02:30.550 --> 02:32.074
Is he supposed to be?

02:33.520 --> 02:36.546
- You want me to call him?
- We're gonna sit down there.

02:41.361 --> 02:43.022
VIP table's better!

02:58.044 --> 02:59.033
Hello?

03:01.080 --> 03:02.707
An FBI informant?

03:05.318 --> 03:07.479
I must've been out of cell phone range.

03:07.554 --> 03:09.021
Your accountant didn't reach you?

03:09.088 --> 03:11.283
A.J. said he talked to you four hours ago.

03:11.791 --> 03:14.021
Well, Ginsberg didn't call me.

03:16.763 --> 03:19.254
I'm gonna fuck her face up before I kill her.

03:20.133 --> 03:22.795
Look, I said I'll talk to him,
so I'll talk to him.

03:22.869 --> 03:25.599
Cousin Brian is dropping
those estate papers off tomorrow.

03:25.972 --> 03:28.497
Good, I'm anxious to look them over.

03:47.527 --> 03:50.018
<i>Let's give it up for No Soap Radio.</i>

03:54.801 --> 03:57.201
<i>Was that a steamroler of a set?</i>

03:58.204 --> 04:01.139
<i>Pick up one of the new CDs for sale
up at the front.</i>

04:17.390 --> 04:19.051
Come on, Giovanni.

04:19.591 --> 04:22.186
Jesus Christ, he's pissing his pants.

04:51.557 --> 04:53.184
You want me to do it again?

05:13.046 --> 05:15.708
<i>There you go. Looks pretty good!</i>

05:19.352 --> 05:21.252
<i>Okay, that's great.</i>

05:26.359 --> 05:27.587
<i>Let's bring out your lover.</i>

05:28.227 --> 05:31.719
The weight she put on in rehab...
How could she do that to herself?

05:31.798 --> 05:34.494
She always had a bad can. It's genetic.

05:37.904 --> 05:38.893
Hello?

05:39.572 --> 05:40.903
Hey, Ma, what's up?

05:41.174 --> 05:43.506
Adriana? You got a call.

05:46.245 --> 05:47.940
Ma, hang on a sec.

05:49.482 --> 05:51.507
<i>- Hello?
- Adriana, it's me.</i>

05:52.352 --> 05:54.047
Why the fuck are you calling me here?

05:54.120 --> 05:56.281
Don't hang up, because I'll just call back.

05:56.356 --> 05:58.017
Ma, I'll call you later.

05:58.257 --> 06:01.715
I know, Ma. Goddamn it,
I'll pick up the Sensodyne.

06:01.794 --> 06:05.059
- Norman, I got to take this.
- Ade, I got a boliage at 11:00.

06:05.732 --> 06:07.097
Are you following me?

06:07.166 --> 06:09.794
We wanna talk to you. A&B Bakery...

06:09.869 --> 06:11.530
<i>route 10, East Hanover.</i>

06:11.604 --> 06:13.265
I got to drive all the way up there?

06:13.339 --> 06:15.967
You don't want us talking to you
in your neighborhood.

06:16.042 --> 06:19.034
<i>And don't go anywhere.
We got a unit watching the beauty shop.</i>

06:24.283 --> 06:26.911
- I'm getting lights and a wax.
- We'll wait.

06:32.158 --> 06:33.455
Janice, hi.

06:34.594 --> 06:36.323
Listen, I can't stay.

06:36.396 --> 06:39.490
I just brought Bobby Junior
a couple of Xbox games...

06:39.632 --> 06:41.395
a friend of mine burned for him.

06:41.467 --> 06:42.456
JoJo.

06:42.935 --> 06:45.301
Hi. What are you doing here?

06:45.371 --> 06:47.168
Janice, look at you.

06:48.841 --> 06:52.208
I made Bobby and the kids
some of my chicken marsala.

06:52.645 --> 06:55.273
It's times like this,
I remember when I lost Mikey.

06:55.348 --> 06:57.077
It's impossible to think about food...

06:57.150 --> 06:59.380
but like the President says:

06:59.452 --> 07:01.283
"We have to keep going. "

07:01.354 --> 07:03.117
The family's got to eat.

07:03.189 --> 07:06.181
I'm picking up the kids
after schooI, Bobby. No argument.

07:07.293 --> 07:10.126
He's hanging in, though, aren't you, Bobby?

07:10.596 --> 07:12.587
Leave those. The girI's coming today.

07:12.665 --> 07:14.292
Then I better do these pots at least.

07:14.367 --> 07:17.063
I've seen Rigoberta
with those copper tuffies.

07:17.136 --> 07:19.229
What she's done to this Teflon.

07:20.006 --> 07:23.669
Any time you want to drop Sophia
and little Bobby off, don't be shy.

07:23.743 --> 07:26.678
I mean it. My kids would love it.

07:26.746 --> 07:29.772
How is MichaeI Junior doing on the Ritalin?

07:30.550 --> 07:32.518
The way they medicate kids today...

07:32.585 --> 07:34.348
It's the answer for everything.

07:34.420 --> 07:37.048
Then they wonder
why teenagers get hooked on drugs.

07:37.123 --> 07:39.785
If a child had diabetes,
you'd give him insulin.

07:39.859 --> 07:41.349
I didn't mean it like that.

07:41.427 --> 07:43.190
Bobby's got to come home anyway.

07:43.262 --> 07:45.890
Karen always made him
do his homework before dinner...

07:45.965 --> 07:47.830
or it didn't get done.

08:02.415 --> 08:04.440
The chicken, Bobby...

08:04.884 --> 08:08.285
put it in a 350 oven for 20 minutes.
You just want to heat it.

08:08.688 --> 08:10.781
And if you have some egg noodles...

08:10.857 --> 08:12.722
It's better the first night.

08:13.960 --> 08:16.087
- Enjoy.
- Thank you, JoJo.

08:29.108 --> 08:31.372
Everybody's been so nice.

08:31.711 --> 08:32.871
I'll bet.

08:36.716 --> 08:39.378
Look at all these casseroles people brought.

08:40.820 --> 08:42.515
Stuffed shells.

08:43.054 --> 08:44.283
Gabriella.

08:46.259 --> 08:47.590
Ziti.

08:47.827 --> 08:49.454
Karen made that.

08:52.131 --> 08:55.100
- I'm sorry.
- That's her last ziti before she died.

08:55.201 --> 08:56.691
I didn't know.

08:59.071 --> 09:01.301
I loved her so much.

09:03.042 --> 09:05.442
I thank God for every day we had together.

09:07.046 --> 09:10.538
- She was an angeI.
- I know. She was speciaI.

09:20.493 --> 09:21.983
Miss La Cerva.

09:23.663 --> 09:25.528
Agent Harris. We met.

09:26.065 --> 09:27.692
This is agent Sanseverino.

09:28.501 --> 09:29.763
Hi, Adriana.

09:30.303 --> 09:31.702
Eat shit, Danielle.

09:32.071 --> 09:34.266
Or whatever the fuck your name is.

09:35.074 --> 09:37.008
Get you a latte? Scone?

09:37.877 --> 09:41.540
I just want you people to leave me alone.
How many times I have to tell you?

09:41.614 --> 09:42.979
I don't know anything.

09:43.883 --> 09:47.614
You people are just trying to scare me.
Nobody's trying to hurt Christopher.

09:47.687 --> 09:50.485
What was he doing in Yonkers last night?

09:51.691 --> 09:52.783
What?

09:53.359 --> 09:55.793
- I don't know.
- Somebody saw him having drinks...

09:55.861 --> 09:59.160
at the Renaissance Inn
with an individuaI named Chip Zoto.

09:59.231 --> 10:02.689
Christopher ever mention a Chip Zoto,
or just plain Chip?

10:03.569 --> 10:04.558
No.

10:05.071 --> 10:06.595
Here's what's problematic.

10:06.672 --> 10:08.606
You don't even know
where your boyfriend is.

10:08.674 --> 10:10.539
How do you know if he's in trouble?

10:10.610 --> 10:12.237
He's into heroin, organized crime.

10:12.311 --> 10:14.973
He's associating
with some very dangerous people...

10:15.047 --> 10:17.345
not to mention Tony Soprano himself.

10:17.416 --> 10:19.213
See, that's where you're wrong.

10:19.285 --> 10:21.776
Tony would never let
anything happen to Christopher.

10:21.854 --> 10:23.515
They're cousins, he loves him.

10:23.589 --> 10:26.217
He loved Pussy Bonpensiero.
What happened to him?

10:26.292 --> 10:28.453
He went in the Witness Protection program.

10:28.527 --> 10:30.893
Dwight? He went into the program?

10:30.963 --> 10:33.158
You know anything about that?

10:33.566 --> 10:35.898
- No.
- I think we would've heard.

10:35.968 --> 10:39.301
And your uncle Richie,
I suppose he's in the program, too.

10:40.539 --> 10:41.665
He is.

10:45.578 --> 10:46.567
Isn't he?

10:52.918 --> 10:56.854
This is a way out for you.
You have your whole life in front of you.

10:56.922 --> 10:59.322
We'd like to see you two have a chance.

10:59.859 --> 11:00.848
Okay.

11:02.128 --> 11:03.857
I'm gonna get back.

11:04.230 --> 11:05.822
Where are you going?

11:05.898 --> 11:08.594
You're gonna be working
with agent Sanseverino here.

11:08.668 --> 11:09.657
What?

11:10.703 --> 11:11.795
Why?

11:11.871 --> 11:13.532
It's for your own safety.

11:13.606 --> 11:15.437
And you know what we were talking about?

11:15.508 --> 11:17.442
About the little creatures?

11:17.510 --> 11:19.808
Good luck with that. I mean it.

11:19.879 --> 11:20.971
Fuck you.

11:35.494 --> 11:39.225
The more you can tell us,
the more we can help you and Christopher.

11:40.132 --> 11:42.692
He doesn't need your help.

11:42.902 --> 11:44.870
He can take care of himself.

11:47.339 --> 11:49.136
You want some water?

11:49.875 --> 11:51.365
How's Tony been lately?

11:51.444 --> 11:54.311
I have no fucking idea. I told you already.

11:54.380 --> 11:55.870
Been over to the house?

11:56.315 --> 11:58.146
I don't go over there.

12:00.586 --> 12:01.780
Hardly ever.

12:02.354 --> 12:05.016
That should be your area of focus,
if possible.

12:05.091 --> 12:06.922
I don't feeI so good.

12:21.640 --> 12:23.369
A little more salt?

12:24.110 --> 12:25.839
No, it's delicious.

12:27.613 --> 12:31.572
- Listen, I was talking to cousin Brian-
- I'm seeing Ginsberg tomorrow.

12:31.650 --> 12:32.742
No, not that.

12:32.818 --> 12:35.946
He gave me a free tip on a medicaI stock
that's gonna move soon.

12:36.021 --> 12:38.216
He said we should put $10,000 in it.

12:38.290 --> 12:39.621
$10,000?

12:39.892 --> 12:41.052
It's not that much.

12:41.127 --> 12:43.493
Right. It's not a meaningfuI investment.

12:43.929 --> 12:47.888
That much of Dell Computer bought in 1989
is worth $5 million today.

12:51.070 --> 12:53.698
We don't have
that kind of money on hand right now.

12:53.773 --> 12:55.172
Things are tight.

12:55.641 --> 12:58.269
Don't you read the papers? The economy?

12:59.779 --> 13:02.213
It sounded like a wonderfuI opportunity.

13:03.916 --> 13:05.781
What are you gonna do?

13:42.621 --> 13:44.885
Waldorf-Astoria for horses back here.

13:44.957 --> 13:47.391
Groom, trainer, three meals a day.

13:48.060 --> 13:50.893
No, watch out for the goat, it butts.

13:51.030 --> 13:52.657
My Nina Lento cooked goat.

13:52.731 --> 13:54.221
What's it doing here?

13:54.300 --> 13:55.528
Horses like company.

13:55.601 --> 13:57.501
Seabiscuit had a horse he traveled with.

13:57.570 --> 14:00.004
How do you like that?
You own a horse, Tony?

14:00.072 --> 14:02.199
Please, as his accountant...

14:02.274 --> 14:04.538
I thought about it a couple times...

14:04.877 --> 14:07.175
but it's an animaI, it's a commitment.

14:07.913 --> 14:09.813
Don't tell me with the buck shins again?

14:09.882 --> 14:12.680
No, she's fine. We had a great morning.

14:12.885 --> 14:14.716
Jesus, that's a beautifuI horse.

14:14.787 --> 14:17.551
She'll be a bottle of LePage
if she don't win this race.

14:17.623 --> 14:19.989
Bubbala, you want a sure thing? Buy bonds.

14:20.059 --> 14:22.027
Lois is the best trainer here.

14:22.094 --> 14:24.688
<i>This ciuccio, he sells me a horse.</i>

14:24.763 --> 14:26.560
The next week it starts losing.

14:26.632 --> 14:28.293
I don't know what got into her.

14:28.367 --> 14:30.392
She ran the whole race ahead
by two lengths...

14:30.469 --> 14:32.528
and then she just stopped
in the backstretch.

14:32.605 --> 14:34.800
- Stopped?
- Slowed down, finished fourth.

14:34.874 --> 14:37.866
- As in out of the money.
- Maybe you should try holding her back.

14:37.943 --> 14:39.342
Keep something for the finish.

14:39.411 --> 14:42.380
Horse is a front runner.
She likes running up front.

14:42.448 --> 14:43.881
So, what if she don't win?

14:43.949 --> 14:47.885
I have to agree with Lois here.
A horse has style, you don't fuck with it.

14:47.953 --> 14:50.353
It's her kind of track today. Fast.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.152
She did draw the one hole.

14:52.224 --> 14:53.691
Done, said, finished.

14:53.759 --> 14:57.661
Tony, all due respect,
I'm inclined to defer to the experts.

14:57.963 --> 14:59.021
Me, too.

14:59.098 --> 15:00.190
All right.

15:01.200 --> 15:02.667
Wire to wire.

15:03.636 --> 15:06.503
And tell that midget
not to be shy with the whip.

15:08.707 --> 15:10.971
If only his mother had taken that advice.

15:12.645 --> 15:14.806
That's what you're wearing to court?

15:17.516 --> 15:19.848
- I'll get it.
- Now what?

15:22.488 --> 15:24.080
It's your niece.

15:25.557 --> 15:27.320
Morning, Uncle Jun'.

15:28.327 --> 15:31.296
- Great tie.
- What's that?

15:31.931 --> 15:34.923
Dinner tonight.
It's some delicious chicken marsala.

15:35.401 --> 15:39.633
Murf, 350 oven for 20 minutes,
just so it's hot.

15:39.705 --> 15:43.300
- And if you have some egg noodles-
- Go bring the car around.

15:44.944 --> 15:46.070
Where you going?

15:46.145 --> 15:48.477
- I'm getting my jacket.
- I'll bring it.

15:48.547 --> 15:50.640
Go get the car, we're late.

15:50.716 --> 15:53.617
I got to go upstairs,
get some change for the parking.

15:54.720 --> 15:57.883
I've been meaning to get down to the court
to show my solidarity.

15:58.123 --> 16:00.057
But this thing with Bobby...

16:00.125 --> 16:03.060
- He needs help with those kids.
- He needs help?

16:03.395 --> 16:06.330
- I'm on triaI for my life.
- He's gonna get through this.

16:06.398 --> 16:09.060
When? I'm waiting
like patience on a monument.

16:15.641 --> 16:17.768
You really depend on him, don't you?

16:18.077 --> 16:20.568
This one, he drives like a little old lady.

16:20.646 --> 16:22.910
Gas, brake, gas, brake.

16:23.148 --> 16:25.673
You know, I remember Daddy said...

16:25.751 --> 16:28.549
that someday Bobby
would be your linchpin.

16:29.722 --> 16:31.314
My brother said that?

16:33.325 --> 16:35.793
Bobby was still a head waiter
when Johnny died.

16:35.861 --> 16:37.658
Bobby's doing better.

16:37.997 --> 16:40.522
We had a very healing day yesterday.

16:40.899 --> 16:44.562
I helped him go through Karen's things
for Saint Vincent de PauI.

16:45.037 --> 16:47.665
- Psychologically, that's enormous.
- Yesterday?

16:48.674 --> 16:49.868
Bobby was home?

16:50.175 --> 16:51.164
Why?

16:52.344 --> 16:54.869
He had to take care
of something for me, that's why.

16:54.947 --> 16:56.346
What was it?

16:56.415 --> 16:57.507
Goddamn it.

16:58.384 --> 17:01.353
Each of us is alone in the fucking universe.

17:07.559 --> 17:09.823
So this estate planning shit...

17:09.895 --> 17:12.989
Carmela wants it, and I got
nothing against getting well set up.

17:13.065 --> 17:15.693
<i>Half of these cidrules
live one day to the next.</i>

17:15.768 --> 17:18.566
The blue chip portfolio
like your cousin's suggesting...

17:18.637 --> 17:20.537
to keep pace with inflation?

17:20.606 --> 17:23.439
If it makes your wife happy, go with God.

17:27.413 --> 17:30.211
I'm supposed to make the money,
she takes care of the house.

17:30.282 --> 17:32.375
That's the way it should be.

17:32.651 --> 17:35.586
Carmela's a smart woman.
If we start winning in the market...

17:35.654 --> 17:38.555
it's gonna be InteI this
and Coca-Cola that. It'll never end.

17:42.694 --> 17:44.821
This other thing your cousin advised...

17:45.330 --> 17:47.127
the life insurance trust?

17:47.466 --> 17:48.933
Big red flag.

17:49.635 --> 17:52.570
What? The kid said
there was tremendous tax advantages.

17:52.638 --> 17:54.868
To Carmela, when you die.

17:55.240 --> 17:58.471
But present day,
if something unforeseen should arise...

17:58.744 --> 18:00.234
divorce, say...

18:00.312 --> 18:02.439
that type of trust is irrevocable.

18:02.714 --> 18:06.377
It can't be changed. You have to
petition the court, and even then...

18:09.121 --> 18:10.349
Don't get me wrong.

18:10.622 --> 18:12.715
A trust, per se, is a good thing.

18:13.192 --> 18:15.626
Avoids probate, prying eyes...

18:16.061 --> 18:17.824
but there's other ways to go.

18:17.896 --> 18:20.694
Such as an inter vivos, a living trust.

18:24.536 --> 18:25.560
Here they go.

18:25.637 --> 18:27.969
<i>They're in the gate, and they're off.</i>

18:28.240 --> 18:30.105
- Come on, baby!
- Here we go.

18:30.442 --> 18:34.071
<i>Out of the gate, it's Vision Be Mine,
Miss Rae Rae and Zucker's Mother...</i>

18:34.146 --> 18:37.081
<i>going for the lead.
Yeah Boy right there on the outside...</i>

18:37.149 --> 18:39.140
<i>Pie-O-My settling into fifth.</i>

18:39.318 --> 18:41.047
Go, goddamn it, go!

18:41.687 --> 18:44.679
- Come on, move up!
- Come on, baby, come on!

18:45.757 --> 18:47.987
I hate this fucking pygmy.

18:48.060 --> 18:50.620
What's he doing? Get her out of there!

18:50.696 --> 18:51.685
Move her up!

18:51.763 --> 18:55.028
<i>Vision Be Mine folowing by a length,
Pie-O-My back two lengths...</i>

18:55.100 --> 18:56.624
No! I got $5,000 on her.

18:56.702 --> 18:58.329
She's gonna make it, here we go!

18:58.403 --> 19:00.598
Come on, baby! Come on, girI!

19:00.672 --> 19:03.664
<i>Zucker's Mother, Miss Rae Rae,
Vision Be Mine, and Pie-O-My...</i>

19:03.742 --> 19:05.232
<i>joins the front runners.</i>

19:05.310 --> 19:06.902
She's coming around!

19:06.979 --> 19:09.504
<i>- Jesus, look at her go!
- Making a move on the outside...</i>

19:09.581 --> 19:12.812
<i>it's Pie-O-My, with a tremendous push,
with tremendous speed.</i>

19:12.885 --> 19:14.216
Come on, girI!

19:14.286 --> 19:16.584
<i>At the top of the stretch it's Pie-O-My...</i>

19:16.655 --> 19:18.646
<i>chalenging Zucker's Mother for the lead.</i>

19:18.724 --> 19:20.316
<i>Pie-O-My and Zucker's Mother!</i>

19:20.392 --> 19:23.384
<i>Pie-O-My and Zucker's Mother
as we head for home!</i>

19:23.762 --> 19:25.730
<i>Pie-O-My puling ahead...</i>

19:26.098 --> 19:29.499
<i>Pie-O-My with speed to burn,
and it's Pie-O-My!</i>

19:29.935 --> 19:31.926
<i>Pie-O-My coming from behind to win it!</i>

19:32.004 --> 19:33.938
<i>Pie-O-My hits the wire first!</i>

19:35.407 --> 19:36.931
Son of a bitch!

19:38.677 --> 19:40.474
I won! I'm rich!

19:42.080 --> 19:44.014
$5,000 at eight-to-one!

19:44.082 --> 19:47.813
<i>Heading for the winner's circle
is Pie-O-My, owned by lnez Munoz.</i>

19:53.192 --> 19:54.659
Who is that?

19:54.760 --> 19:56.091
That's his girlfriend.

19:56.161 --> 19:59.153
I'll give you a shot in the fucking head.
"My girlfriend. "

19:59.665 --> 20:00.893
It's his maid.

20:01.400 --> 20:03.459
Right, the racing license.

20:06.205 --> 20:08.400
Miss Munoz,
as the owner of the winning horse...

20:08.473 --> 20:11.772
you'll receive an 8 x 10 glossy
in two to four weeks.

20:14.880 --> 20:16.279
You, Anthony.

20:20.085 --> 20:22.383
What did you say? "Hold her back. "

20:23.422 --> 20:25.515
You are not going unthanked.

20:25.591 --> 20:26.615
You...

20:26.692 --> 20:28.956
I'm giving a taste of my win.

20:31.330 --> 20:32.661
Hey, Inez!

20:33.632 --> 20:35.065
Come here, have some champagne.

20:35.133 --> 20:37.499
Mr. Ralph, I don't know...

20:41.039 --> 20:42.506
There he is.

20:43.342 --> 20:45.139
I wanna congratulate you.

20:45.244 --> 20:47.007
I asked, and she was there.

20:47.112 --> 20:48.977
You know, not for nothing.

20:49.314 --> 20:52.545
The horse won, but that was not
the agreed upon strategy.

20:52.618 --> 20:54.017
Nicky didn't sit on it.

20:54.086 --> 20:56.919
She was bumped out of the gate
and got stuck in a speed trap.

20:56.989 --> 20:59.719
So this coming behind, this was a fluke?

21:00.092 --> 21:02.322
This man here, he knew.

21:02.928 --> 21:04.122
We all get lucky.

21:04.196 --> 21:06.027
No, right is right, Anthony.

21:06.265 --> 21:08.995
Fluke, escolar, whatever the fuck...

21:09.134 --> 21:10.567
I'm giving you your taste.

21:10.636 --> 21:12.968
- Your money's no good.
- I insist.

21:13.338 --> 21:15.033
She ran your race.

21:15.841 --> 21:17.274
You called it.

21:17.709 --> 21:19.074
End of story.

21:19.144 --> 21:21.544
$300, $400, $500, $600.

21:22.180 --> 21:25.877
And I need $150 more this week
for A.J.'s football cleats.

21:26.618 --> 21:29.212
- In my day, they were $50.
- $50?

21:29.288 --> 21:32.485
That's what I pay to get your suits
out of the cleaners.

21:34.760 --> 21:37.285
So you got those papers for me to sign?

21:37.863 --> 21:40.661
- Brian's?
- I told you I'd talk to Ginsberg.

21:40.832 --> 21:41.821
Got a pen?

21:41.900 --> 21:44.391
Anthony Soprano, that is wonderfuI.

21:47.839 --> 21:50.330
That's so great, I am so impressed.

21:53.945 --> 21:55.913
"Authorization to open an account. "

21:55.981 --> 21:58.415
It's wherever there's a little red arrow.

22:00.118 --> 22:01.449
And there.

22:02.154 --> 22:04.213
You need to sign
the agency papers here, too.

22:04.289 --> 22:06.883
It gives Brian authorization
to buy stocks on our behalf.

22:06.958 --> 22:09.449
Where the little circles are here, initials?

22:09.528 --> 22:11.519
You will not regret this, Tony, truly.

22:11.596 --> 22:15.623
This is the best thing for all of us.
It'll give us such peace of mind.

22:18.470 --> 22:20.370
Wait, there's one more.

22:22.941 --> 22:24.966
I'm not gonna sign that one.

22:25.110 --> 22:26.168
Why not?

22:26.978 --> 22:28.639
I don't think it's a good idea.

22:28.714 --> 22:32.172
But this is the trust.
It's in case something happens to you.

22:32.651 --> 22:34.710
- I'm not gonna sign it.
- You have to.

22:34.786 --> 22:38.449
Remember your children, your wife?
So they don't end up out on the street?

22:38.623 --> 22:40.523
Yeah, well, there's better ones.

22:40.592 --> 22:42.287
- "In vitro" something.
- What?

22:42.361 --> 22:45.262
- What's wrong with this one?
- It's irrevocable.

22:45.364 --> 22:47.958
- We don't wanna get locked in.
- To what?

22:48.934 --> 22:51.129
"Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee. "

22:51.203 --> 22:52.227
Excuse me?

22:52.304 --> 22:54.795
It's the government, Carm.
You've got to be flexible.

22:54.873 --> 22:57.171
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

22:58.443 --> 23:00.343
Come on, Carm, be fair.

23:00.912 --> 23:02.937
I gave you two out of three.

23:03.949 --> 23:05.348
You gave me?

23:20.532 --> 23:21.999
In here, hon.

23:29.441 --> 23:32.569
What're you doing in bed?
We got dinner with Tony and Carmela.

23:32.644 --> 23:34.043
I can't go.

23:34.212 --> 23:35.440
I'm sick.

23:35.714 --> 23:38.945
- What do you mean?
- I don't know, I got chills and a fever.

23:40.185 --> 23:43.211
I think I'm getting the flu.
I shouldn't go up there.

23:43.321 --> 23:46.381
Come on, get dressed.
Couple of drinks, it'll kill the germs.

23:46.458 --> 23:48.688
- You'll forget it all.
- You better go without me.

23:48.760 --> 23:50.125
But you have to go.

23:50.195 --> 23:53.358
This is the inner sanctum, here.
I'm not just a relative anymore.

23:53.432 --> 23:57.129
<i>You think Paulie and his cumares
ever get invited to dinner with them?</i>

23:57.202 --> 23:58.567
I'm sorry.

23:59.604 --> 24:01.595
Maybe if I just sleep...

24:09.948 --> 24:11.916
Nothing ever goes my way.

24:22.127 --> 24:23.594
Is that sausage?

24:23.662 --> 24:25.755
My mom made it with hamburger.

24:25.831 --> 24:26.820
See?

24:28.366 --> 24:31.335
Just a spoonfuI, Jan. That's enough, thanks.

24:34.105 --> 24:38.701
Why don't you kids tell Daddy what we saw
on the way home from schooI today?

24:41.012 --> 24:43.446
The Fuji blimp over Willowbrook Mall?

24:44.783 --> 24:45.772
So?

24:46.151 --> 24:49.382
You kids seemed to like it when you saw it.

24:49.788 --> 24:51.813
You begged me to follow it.

24:52.724 --> 24:55.158
It was nice of you to pick them up for me.

24:55.227 --> 24:57.752
- And making dinner.
- Enjoy, everybody.

25:00.232 --> 25:02.530
It does smell good, doesn't it?

25:03.768 --> 25:06.430
- Did you eat yet?
- I'll get something at home.

25:07.239 --> 25:09.730
No, it's all right, isn't it, kids?

25:13.478 --> 25:15.810
Can we eat in front of the TV?

25:16.481 --> 25:18.847
- That's rude.
- No, kids.

25:18.917 --> 25:20.976
I'm the one barging in.

25:21.052 --> 25:23.111
You go right in there.

25:23.421 --> 25:26.948
You know how to set up the TV trays.
You want a little more?

25:27.492 --> 25:30.689
- Okay. It's pretty good, actually.
- Thank you, Bobby.

25:34.633 --> 25:38.262
I told you I don't want them to be spoiled
because they lost their mother.

25:42.207 --> 25:43.970
I saw my uncle today.

25:46.578 --> 25:48.375
- Jesus.
- That's right.

25:51.016 --> 25:52.040
Is he mad?

25:52.117 --> 25:55.484
What's going on, Bobby?
What were you supposed to do?

25:56.154 --> 25:58.315
- Union business.
- What's going on?

25:58.857 --> 26:01.018
This election coming up, that's all.

26:02.394 --> 26:05.158
I'm the one that should've been in that car...

26:05.230 --> 26:06.527
not Karen.

26:07.933 --> 26:11.164
And Junior's been so good to me,
and I'm letting him down.

26:12.571 --> 26:13.902
Fuck him!

26:14.039 --> 26:16.633
He only thinks of himself, selfish old fuck.

26:16.741 --> 26:18.368
Now listen to me.

26:18.543 --> 26:21.137
I know my uncle, he's a patient man.

26:21.580 --> 26:23.844
But he's at the point,
if you don't do your job...

26:23.915 --> 26:27.373
he'll find somebody who will,
you know what I'm talking about?

26:27.719 --> 26:32.122
All your effort, all the years you put in
getting your ticket punched...

26:32.791 --> 26:34.258
you'll be a nobody.

26:34.626 --> 26:37.424
I don't care anymore. That's the problem.

26:38.029 --> 26:39.963
I don't care if I live or die.

26:41.399 --> 26:43.890
We lose that luxury when we have children.

26:45.437 --> 26:48.702
I remember my son Harpo,
when my husband left us...

26:49.407 --> 26:52.035
I had both barrels of a shotgun
in my mouth...

26:52.577 --> 26:55.171
but then just one thought of Harpo...

26:56.448 --> 26:58.541
my little boy without his mother...

27:01.853 --> 27:03.946
Every day is worse than the last.

27:05.857 --> 27:07.586
My uncle loves you.

27:08.226 --> 27:09.523
He needs you.

27:10.395 --> 27:12.920
So you're going to get up
tomorrow morning...

27:12.998 --> 27:16.399
and you're going to get dressed,
and you're going to get in that car...

27:16.468 --> 27:20.268
and you're going to do
what needs to be done, aren't you?

27:30.382 --> 27:33.317
Okay, then. Now will you eat something?

27:38.990 --> 27:41.982
Show me one of those trusts,
the living ones.

27:42.060 --> 27:45.086
Okay, I can see
where you'd want more mutability, Ton'.

27:45.163 --> 27:47.996
Mutability mean money?
Because that's what I want.

27:50.935 --> 27:54.200
Carmela's cousin, Brian Cammarata.
Ralphie Cifaretto.

27:54.272 --> 27:56.365
- This is the life.
- What life's that?

27:57.375 --> 27:58.501
I didn't mean-

27:58.576 --> 28:01.136
I'm kidding, just kidding.
Any cousin of Tony's...

28:01.846 --> 28:03.507
Lois, how's she look today?

28:03.581 --> 28:06.311
Been clocking her best fractions yet, 21.45.

28:06.384 --> 28:09.547
She's in some rich company, though.
Zucker's Mother again.

28:09.621 --> 28:12.146
And this other one,
frigging Kentucky thoroughbred.

28:12.223 --> 28:15.056
You wanted a stakes horse,
this is a stakes race.

28:15.160 --> 28:16.923
I think she's ready.

28:17.062 --> 28:19.394
So, Dr. Dolittle, any thoughts?

28:19.464 --> 28:21.989
Only six furlongs.
She should run it head-to-head.

28:22.067 --> 28:25.264
Excuse me, señor,
if I'd listened to you last time...

28:25.770 --> 28:26.930
She's right.

28:27.205 --> 28:30.072
Short race like this, let her blow them away.

28:31.609 --> 28:33.634
Foolish that I am...

28:33.978 --> 28:35.878
I'm going to place some bets.

28:36.114 --> 28:39.174
<i>They're al in line, and they're off.</i>

28:40.318 --> 28:43.253
Look. The five horse bumped her.
You see that, piece of shit!

28:43.321 --> 28:44.379
Come on, baby!

28:44.456 --> 28:47.687
<i>lt's Zucker's Mother with Tenant's Harbor
to the inside in the lead.</i>

28:47.759 --> 28:51.718
<i>Zucker's Mother, Lil' Camile, Pie-O-My
and Tenant's Harbor sprint for the lead.</i>

28:51.796 --> 28:53.957
- Run, goddamn it!
- Go!

28:54.032 --> 28:56.660
<i>Coming to the top,
Pie-O-My has the rail in the lead...</i>

28:56.735 --> 28:58.703
<i>Pie-O-My ahead by two lengths as they-</i>

28:58.770 --> 29:00.670
Run, you fucking nag!

29:00.739 --> 29:03.003
- Come on, Pie!
- Come on, baby, go!

29:03.074 --> 29:04.234
She's pulling ahead!

29:04.309 --> 29:06.140
<i>Here comes Lil' Camile from the outside.</i>

29:06.211 --> 29:07.906
- Come on, Pie!
- Go!

29:07.979 --> 29:09.344
He can't get you!

29:09.681 --> 29:11.876
<i>- She just can't beat Pie-O-My.
- Yeah, baby!</i>

29:11.950 --> 29:16.512
<i>Pie-O-My hits the wire first, Lil' Camile
was second and Tenant's Harbor, third.</i>

29:18.356 --> 29:19.687
BeautifuI!

29:20.291 --> 29:21.849
Damn it, I bet to show.

29:24.229 --> 29:27.164
What'd you win, $5? My financiaI advisor.

29:27.232 --> 29:28.859
This is it. This is happiness.

29:28.933 --> 29:31.993
Winning is one thing,
but when it's your horse, right?

29:32.070 --> 29:33.162
Yeah.

29:37.876 --> 29:42.210
Once again, your horse wisdom
is not going unappreciated.

29:51.556 --> 29:55.219
<i>Heading to the winner's circle is Pie-O-My.</i>

29:56.194 --> 29:59.254
<i>Pie-O-My is owned by lnez Munoz...</i>

29:59.330 --> 30:01.798
<i>and trained by Lois Pettit.</i>

30:54.652 --> 30:56.745
I see the flowers got here.

31:00.992 --> 31:03.688
Which you like better,
the lilies or the roses?

31:21.579 --> 31:23.171
I came into some cash.

31:25.183 --> 31:27.811
Sold a property
down on Frelinghuysen Avenue.

31:29.621 --> 31:31.646
It's okay, let's buy that stock.

31:31.890 --> 31:34.518
It split. It's too late, we missed it.

32:55.506 --> 32:57.371
You're Teddy Genaretti, aren't you?

32:57.442 --> 32:59.433
The shop steward for locaI 184?

32:59.877 --> 33:02.141
Guilty. You a joint fitter?

33:03.414 --> 33:05.143
What can I get you?

33:05.616 --> 33:08.346
Wild Turkey, neat.
I saw your Caravan in the lot.

33:08.987 --> 33:10.716
It's a nice car for a family.

33:10.788 --> 33:12.847
- Do I know you?
- Jim Blake.

33:13.691 --> 33:15.090
What locaI you in?

33:15.693 --> 33:16.955
Bad back.

33:17.595 --> 33:20.758
I follow these things,
you know, with this election coming up.

33:20.898 --> 33:22.991
Dick Hoffman for President?

33:23.101 --> 33:26.070
I heard he's got 184's vote.
I think it's a mistake.

33:26.170 --> 33:28.900
Pension's been ripped off
for the last 25 years.

33:28.973 --> 33:31.840
I'm sure you guys got grievances,
but Dick Hoffman?

33:32.110 --> 33:33.600
What do you owe this guy?

33:33.678 --> 33:36.579
It's all talk.
He's out of touch with reality, Dick.

33:36.981 --> 33:40.246
You think if push came to shove
he'd give a fuck about you?

33:40.818 --> 33:44.185
- I know what you're trying to do.
- You look like a smart guy.

33:44.255 --> 33:47.713
I can see why your locaI
puts their faith in you to do the right thing.

33:47.792 --> 33:50.022
I'm just saying, if it was me...

33:50.194 --> 33:53.220
I got kids that depend on me, like yourself.

33:53.398 --> 33:56.299
And to waste my votes
on somebody like Dick Hoffman?

33:56.534 --> 33:59.435
I might as well put a bullet in my head, here.

34:21.159 --> 34:24.424
<i>Affordable solutions
to al your fitness chalenges.</i>

34:24.495 --> 34:29.262
<i>Now, the Body by Jake design team
has used a remarkable new technology...</i>

34:29.333 --> 34:33.167
<i>to attack three of the biggest problem areas
below the waistline...</i>

34:33.371 --> 34:35.668
<i>with the Body by Jake

34:35.739 --> 34:38.264
<i>the three minute hip,

<i>So now you can quickly and easily
trim and tone the hips and thighs.</i>

34:43.147 --> 34:46.081
- What are you, up?
- Cosette, go to your basket.

34:51.422 --> 34:54.322
- What's the matter with you?
- Because I'm glad to see you.

34:54.391 --> 34:56.757
I worry about you staying out so late.

34:56.828 --> 34:58.887
- Since when?
- You hungry?

34:58.963 --> 35:01.488
- Want some scrambled eggs?
- Yeah, all right.

35:30.862 --> 35:32.386
I'm thinking...

35:32.730 --> 35:35.062
maybe we should try someplace else.

35:35.133 --> 35:38.625
I saw this thing on TV,
a tour of this house in Santa Barbara...

35:39.203 --> 35:41.694
you should've seen the flowers they had,
the ocean.

35:41.772 --> 35:43.763
I was in California, I didn't like it.

35:43.841 --> 35:47.607
I'm just saying, we're young.
We got our whole life in front of us.

35:47.778 --> 35:50.212
Looks really nice out there. No snow.

35:50.348 --> 35:52.077
You're burning the butter.

35:57.922 --> 35:59.514
Let's be honest.

35:59.991 --> 36:01.618
What's our future here?

36:01.993 --> 36:05.053
You could end up in jaiI,
or something horrible could happen.

36:05.129 --> 36:07.859
Fucking negative shit. Stop with that.

36:08.032 --> 36:10.023
Somebody could have it in for you.

36:10.101 --> 36:11.762
- Who?
- I don't know.

36:12.036 --> 36:14.561
What kind of shit is this?
Who told you that?

36:14.639 --> 36:15.628
Nobody.

36:15.740 --> 36:18.231
Fucking negative shit
coming out of your mouth!

36:18.309 --> 36:20.903
I had that fucking bird watching me
when I got made.

36:20.978 --> 36:23.503
I'm already under
a what-do-you-call-it, possibly.

36:23.581 --> 36:25.105
So stop with that.

36:28.186 --> 36:30.416
I worry about you, that's all.

36:31.189 --> 36:32.656
I love you so much.

36:32.890 --> 36:35.290
So if you love me, stir my eggs, okay?

36:42.500 --> 36:43.831
Excuse me.

36:46.604 --> 36:48.071
Is Tony here?

36:49.607 --> 36:51.404
All right, we'll wait in the office.

36:51.475 --> 36:52.601
What can I get you?

36:52.677 --> 36:54.508
Can I see a bar menu?

36:54.745 --> 36:56.770
I'll take a CC-and-7.

36:57.215 --> 36:59.581
Nachos Grande and a Diet Coke.

37:03.321 --> 37:05.414
Where's your office, in the back?

37:08.326 --> 37:10.021
You should play Skynyrd.

37:16.634 --> 37:18.158
Smells in here.

37:18.536 --> 37:19.525
Mold.

37:20.004 --> 37:21.562
Stuff can kill you, I read.

37:21.973 --> 37:23.201
Fuck that.

37:23.574 --> 37:26.042
What the fuck you think cheese is? Mold.

37:31.382 --> 37:32.371
Holy!

37:32.450 --> 37:33.439
You okay?

37:50.801 --> 37:53.599
It's a beautifuI day in the neighborhood.

37:59.644 --> 38:02.078
And I gotta rot in that courtroom.

38:03.447 --> 38:05.642
I'll put the heat on under the gravy.

38:05.716 --> 38:09.277
My daughter's coming over
to the house for dinner, so I gotta go.

38:09.720 --> 38:12.553
<i>The three men were arrested
in Germany last month.</i>

38:14.792 --> 38:16.760
Did we miss it, goddamn it?

38:17.061 --> 38:20.963
<i>ln other news, in the Federal courthouse
in Newark, there were few surprises...</i>

38:21.032 --> 38:24.468
<i>in the racketeering trial

38:25.169 --> 38:28.696
<i>The 72-year-old defendant listened

<i>The prosecution outlined how accounting...</i>

38:34.111 --> 38:35.669
- What the fuck?
- What?

38:35.746 --> 38:37.976
What kind of likeness is that?

38:38.082 --> 38:41.279
If they were great artists,
they'd be in a museum.

38:42.320 --> 38:45.221
I'm fucking fodder for cartoonists now?

38:50.861 --> 38:53.921
You know, a little support
in the courtroom would be nice...

38:53.998 --> 38:55.795
or are you still hanging crepe?

38:55.866 --> 38:58.198
I took care of the thing, last night.

38:58.402 --> 39:01.462
- The guy, you saw him?
- Him and 184 won't be a problem.

39:02.740 --> 39:03.729
Good.

39:04.175 --> 39:07.576
Hand me that weight over there.
The one in the middle.

39:13.184 --> 39:15.550
Glad to see you're back
in the swing of things.

39:15.619 --> 39:19.248
That moping around, you gotta
put it behind you, get on with your life.

39:19.323 --> 39:21.018
That's what Janice said.

39:22.059 --> 39:23.890
She's been wonderfuI through all this.

39:23.961 --> 39:27.761
Looking after Bobby Junior and Sophia,
bringing dinner over the house.

39:28.666 --> 39:30.566
- She's a pretty good cook.
- Since when?

39:30.634 --> 39:32.795
Everybody steers clear of her food.

39:33.204 --> 39:36.367
She made lasagna the other night, delicious.

39:36.807 --> 39:39.173
With sweet sausage along with the beef.

39:39.377 --> 39:42.574
- I thought Karen's was good, but-
- Sweet sausage?

39:42.913 --> 39:44.540
In little pieces?

39:44.815 --> 39:47.409
A layer of basiI leaves
right underneath the cheese?

39:47.485 --> 39:49.885
- That's right.
- That's Carmela's lasagna.

39:50.454 --> 39:52.445
What the fuck are you talking about?

39:52.523 --> 39:54.684
You always think the worst of everybody.

39:54.759 --> 39:55.748
Fine.

39:56.394 --> 39:59.591
Enjoy your lasagna.
Just don't come running to me.

40:01.298 --> 40:02.287
Shit!

40:04.702 --> 40:06.431
Go see if he's all right.

40:09.206 --> 40:12.539
They were here untiI 1:00.
I couldn't even get into my office.

40:12.610 --> 40:15.135
- This is a good thing, Adriana.
- Why?

40:16.080 --> 40:18.981
They don't pay for nothing.
They ran up a $200 bar bill.

40:19.049 --> 40:21.882
Overcharge some of those college students.

40:24.722 --> 40:28.214
Ralph and them wanted to know
if Tony was here. Why, is he going to be?

40:28.292 --> 40:30.385
You don't know what this guy did for me.

40:30.461 --> 40:31.325
I do.

40:32.129 --> 40:35.724
Not getting my stripes.
Something I can't talk about.

40:36.066 --> 40:39.399
Something that was ruining my whole life,
and he made it right.

40:39.470 --> 40:42.030
What I owe him,
I would follow that man into hell.

40:42.106 --> 40:45.166
But why do they have to come here?
I don't understand.

40:45.242 --> 40:47.142
This place isn't bugged.

40:47.211 --> 40:51.671
The cops and the feds don't know about it.
Probably in time they will, untiI then-

40:55.352 --> 40:56.683
Oh, shit.

41:00.758 --> 41:02.658
They broke my fucking chair!

41:03.994 --> 41:06.986
We're having Sunday dinner at Tony's,
and you're coming.

41:07.064 --> 41:09.259
I don't care if your mother's dying.

41:10.835 --> 41:14.669
Your honor, I introduce as evidence
government exhibit 27-B...

41:14.872 --> 41:18.706
which is a stipulation between the parties
that, if called as a witness...

41:18.776 --> 41:22.007
Koren W. Jonic,
supervisor of the US Post Office...

41:22.313 --> 41:25.908
located at 8721 Wayland Avenue
in Paramus...

41:26.217 --> 41:29.345
would testify
that post office box, number 206...

41:29.553 --> 41:31.851
was registered to and paid for...

41:32.056 --> 41:36.083
by one Ira E. Barad, who resides
at 43 Bellingham Boulevard...

41:36.160 --> 41:39.027
apartment 4-B, Paramus, New Jersey...

41:39.630 --> 41:42.121
and was initially rented by Ira E. Barad...

41:42.199 --> 41:45.225
on September 16, 1998 with a payment of...

41:45.503 --> 41:47.937
I don't care what your psychic said.

41:48.005 --> 41:51.805
If a guy don't call back
within the first 48 hours... No, don't!

41:51.876 --> 41:53.207
Don't call him, Ma.

41:53.277 --> 41:55.905
Because I don't want to hear about it.

41:57.848 --> 42:00.442
Fuck. Nothing, Ma, I gotta go.

42:01.218 --> 42:02.708
I'll call you later, bye.

42:04.255 --> 42:06.723
I can't stay. Christopher's waiting for me.

42:06.790 --> 42:09.190
Just checking in, seeing how you're doing.

42:09.260 --> 42:12.354
How I'm doing?
I can't even get my dog clipped anymore?

42:12.463 --> 42:14.658
- Anything interesting going on?
- No.

42:15.032 --> 42:17.432
Ralph Cifaretto was in your club.

42:18.836 --> 42:22.033
Vito Spatafore, Gene Pontecorvo,
and Patsy Parisi.

42:24.375 --> 42:27.503
It's the law. If they got shirts and shoes on,
I gotta serve them.

42:27.578 --> 42:30.741
Ralph Cifaretto drove down to Philadelphia
last Thursday.

42:31.081 --> 42:33.311
Had a couple of guys with him.

42:33.417 --> 42:35.851
- You know who was in the car?
- No.

42:44.328 --> 42:47.024
You ever heard the name Cogo...

42:47.998 --> 42:49.260
Giovanni?

42:54.772 --> 42:55.830
No.

43:17.127 --> 43:18.594
Okay, look...

43:18.996 --> 43:22.295
Patsy Parisi goes to White Plains
all the time. He gets these suits.

43:22.366 --> 43:24.027
- Suits?
- Yeah, suits.

43:24.535 --> 43:27.902
Some guy came in, and Patsy went out
and got him a bunch of suits.

43:27.972 --> 43:31.169
Boss and stuff, half dozen, dozen.

43:34.244 --> 43:35.711
From his car.

43:39.450 --> 43:41.748
See? How hard was that?

43:49.660 --> 43:52.288
Finally, the woman finds the Easy Off.

43:53.263 --> 43:56.323
- Thanks for picking the kids up.
- No prob.

43:57.635 --> 44:00.160
So, how about you, how was your day?

44:00.504 --> 44:01.493
Good.

44:03.607 --> 44:06.804
I knew it. See, I knew you would feeI better.

44:07.044 --> 44:09.604
- Did you make sure that my uncle knows?
- Yeah.

44:09.680 --> 44:12.308
We should celebrate.
I'll make something nice for dinner.

44:12.383 --> 44:14.613
No. I mean, we should go out.

44:15.586 --> 44:18.111
- Vesuvio?
- Takes too long for them.

44:18.355 --> 44:19.754
Kids like Chinese.

44:20.491 --> 44:21.480
MSG.

44:22.026 --> 44:25.325
I collapsed one time at the Hunan Palace,
complete blackout.

44:25.496 --> 44:27.293
I'll just open a can of soup.

44:27.364 --> 44:30.060
That's crazy.
There must be something I can heat up.

44:30.134 --> 44:32.534
Really, Janice, you do too much already.

44:35.072 --> 44:36.437
What about this?

44:38.142 --> 44:39.370
Karen's ziti?

44:42.546 --> 44:44.537
I'm not ready to eat that yet.

44:46.083 --> 44:47.550
I understand.

44:57.494 --> 44:59.086
Hold on a minute, hon.

45:00.330 --> 45:01.490
Sorry.

45:05.903 --> 45:07.700
What does that mean, "basically"?

45:11.709 --> 45:14.143
He's laying out that kind of cash
to us every week.

45:14.211 --> 45:17.374
He'll write a check to our shell companies,
we'll take the tax hit.

45:17.448 --> 45:18.608
You got it.

45:25.022 --> 45:26.546
How's our girI?

45:28.459 --> 45:31.087
- Our girI?
- Yeah, she had a hot tendon.

45:31.428 --> 45:34.158
You know, it's always something with her.

45:34.231 --> 45:37.359
You should see the veterinarian bills.
Fucking racket.

45:37.434 --> 45:40.403
Know what I think we should do,
if you don't mind my saying?

45:40.471 --> 45:44.237
Switch her shoes to those titanium ones
that Heshie was telling me about.

45:44.308 --> 45:47.675
They don't weigh anything.
So they're good for a tender hoof.

45:48.078 --> 45:49.875
Sure. Why not?

46:02.960 --> 46:04.587
Here you are, baby.

46:09.032 --> 46:10.863
You don't have to answer it.

46:11.068 --> 46:12.330
See who it is.

46:12.503 --> 46:14.232
You want me to answer it?

46:14.705 --> 46:17.139
Will you answer the fucking phone?

46:19.610 --> 46:22.306
<i>Helo, l need to speak with Mr. Ralph.</i>

46:22.846 --> 46:24.143
It's your maid.

46:24.982 --> 46:27.610
What? She's gotta go to the clinic
again tomorrow?

46:27.684 --> 46:30.482
You talk to her,
tell her to get her ass in here.

46:31.021 --> 46:32.352
He isn't in.

46:32.422 --> 46:36.256
<i>Because the horse is very sick,
and he put the horse in my name...</i>

46:36.326 --> 46:38.453
<i>and he say l won't get in no trouble.</i>

46:38.529 --> 46:40.497
<i>The horse doctor won't do nothing...</i>

46:40.564 --> 46:43.761
<i>because Mr. Ralph
don't pay the money he owes to him...</i>

46:43.834 --> 46:47.770
<i>and the horse may to die,
and l don't know what is to do!</i>

46:47.838 --> 46:49.203
All right, wait.

46:50.007 --> 46:51.235
Hold on.

46:53.277 --> 46:56.269
Your horse is sick and the vet
won't do nothing till he's paid.

46:56.346 --> 47:00.442
These guys, no compassion
for the fucking animals whatsoever.

47:00.517 --> 47:02.508
Maybe you better go down there.

47:06.223 --> 47:09.090
Tell her to call 555-0157.

47:25.909 --> 47:28.969
<i>At the outbreak
of the second great war in 1939...</i>

47:29.046 --> 47:33.676
<i>Sir Winston again answered his country's
cal as the First Lord of the Admiralty.</i>

47:33.750 --> 47:35.115
Churchill.

47:35.185 --> 47:38.052
Remember you saw
that TV movie you liked about him?

47:49.433 --> 47:51.731
Carmela, can you shut the door?

47:55.973 --> 47:59.204
Carmela, can you please shut the door?

48:10.520 --> 48:13.819
<i>- The horse is sick. The lady, she-
- Who's this?</i>

48:14.057 --> 48:15.922
<i>Mr. Ralph's housekeeper.</i>

48:15.993 --> 48:19.326
<i>The horse is very sick, and she said to cal,
because they needed-</i>

48:19.396 --> 48:20.727
Slow down.

48:20.831 --> 48:22.890
<i>The horse is sick, the Pie-O-My.</i>

48:23.600 --> 48:26.091
<i>- How bad is it?
- They said she may to die.</i>

48:26.169 --> 48:28.831
<i>The doctor,
he won't do nothing until he gets-</i>

48:28.906 --> 48:32.273
All right. Tell him I'll take care of it.

48:37.981 --> 48:39.243
Son of a bitch.

48:39.616 --> 48:42.608
<i>l am now nearing the end of my journey.</i>

48:43.687 --> 48:47.145
<i>l hope l stil have some services to render.</i>

48:49.059 --> 48:51.084
<i>But in 1955, the advance of time...</i>

48:51.161 --> 48:54.824
<i>did to Churchil what dictators,
armies and war planes had failed to do.</i>

48:54.932 --> 48:56.263
<i>He chose to surrender.</i>

48:56.333 --> 48:58.767
<i>The Queen and husband
attended a formal dinner...</i>

48:58.835 --> 49:01.599
<i>at the venerable statesman's residence
at 10 Downing Street.</i>

49:01.672 --> 49:03.867
<i>Sir Winston had announced...</i>

49:06.543 --> 49:08.773
- Where are you going?
- I gotta go out.

49:08.879 --> 49:10.107
It's raining.

49:10.180 --> 49:13.911
Ralphie Cifaretto's horse is sick,
and they can't find him.

49:13.984 --> 49:16.384
Somebody's gotta go down there
and pay the vet.

49:16.453 --> 49:19.183
- Down where?
- The racetrack.

49:19.256 --> 49:20.621
It's a racehorse?

49:21.692 --> 49:23.421
So why do you have to go?

49:24.494 --> 49:26.792
You bought a racehorse?

49:26.863 --> 49:28.831
No, I didn't buy it.

49:28.966 --> 49:31.935
- It followed you home?
- The horse is sick.

50:26.690 --> 50:29.181
I told him you were coming with the money.

50:29.826 --> 50:33.887
He finally gave her something
to settle her down, so I don't know.

50:34.231 --> 50:37.166
- Will she be all right?
- At least she stopped thrashing.

50:37.234 --> 50:40.863
That's where the danger is. The intestines
get twisted, and you have to cut.

50:40.937 --> 50:43.269
They're finished as racers then.

50:44.741 --> 50:46.140
You the vet?

50:46.410 --> 50:49.038
I gave her a shot, she's quieted down.

50:52.582 --> 50:54.914
Here. Here's your fucking money.

50:55.786 --> 50:58.584
You better hope she's going to be all right.

51:07.164 --> 51:08.495
Good girI.

51:10.801 --> 51:12.530
That's a good girI.

51:15.572 --> 51:16.834
Trust me.

51:18.809 --> 51:20.140
Trust me. It's okay.

51:24.481 --> 51:25.846
Good girI.

52:18.034 --> 52:19.023
It's okay.

52:20.270 --> 52:21.669
It's okay, I know.
