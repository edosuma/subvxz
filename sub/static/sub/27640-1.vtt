00:01.266 --> 00:04.483
(Cell phone rings)

00:04.508 --> 00:06.873
Johnny: Kids! Your
mother's on the phone,

00:06.898 --> 00:08.365
and it's her first day on set,

00:08.393 --> 00:10.660
so let's all make sure we
keep her spirits high, okay?

00:10.696 --> 00:11.728
Alexis, come on.

00:11.763 --> 00:13.430
Mr. Rose, I think you should answer it.

00:13.465 --> 00:14.809
Yeah, she's over there all by herself,

00:14.833 --> 00:16.165
so it's gotta be stressful, right?

00:16.200 --> 00:18.144
- I mean, the jet lag, and...
- Oh my God, answer the phone!

00:18.169 --> 00:19.747
- That's why-that's why...
- Answer the phone, please!

00:19.771 --> 00:21.515
Put her on speaker, how
do you put her on speaker?

00:21.540 --> 00:22.882
- Arghhh!
- Speaker, speaker.

00:22.906 --> 00:24.773
Yeah, hello? Moira?

00:24.808 --> 00:27.109
- _
- Moira: John? Hello? Hello?

00:27.144 --> 00:30.212
<i>Moira? David, I don't
think she can hear me!</i>

00:30.248 --> 00:31.880
John, are you there?

00:31.915 --> 00:33.949
<i>Yeah, I'm here, everybody's here.</i>

00:33.984 --> 00:36.285
<i>I expected to hear from you yesterday.</i>

00:36.320 --> 00:38.186
Kids, say hi to your mother.

00:38.222 --> 00:39.455
- Hey.
- Hi...

00:39.490 --> 00:42.124
- She-she's not my mother.
- Who are those voices?

00:42.159 --> 00:43.648
Uh, your children!

00:43.673 --> 00:46.262
<i>Oh Alexis, do you have strep again?</i>

00:46.297 --> 00:48.497
- That was David!
- Is that Stevie?

00:48.532 --> 00:49.632
Hi.

00:49.667 --> 00:51.400
David! Oh, David, how's the store?

00:51.435 --> 00:54.403
Any new customers, or
is it still friendless?

00:54.438 --> 00:55.704
Okay, thank you.

00:55.740 --> 00:58.574
And John, I know disoriented
you get in my absence.

00:58.609 --> 01:00.842
Don't forget I left
you that Sudoku book.

01:00.878 --> 01:02.623
Yeah, well, I haven't
needed it sweetheart,

01:02.647 --> 01:04.245
because I've been up since 5:00am,

01:04.281 --> 01:06.581
there's so much to do here at the motel.

01:06.616 --> 01:08.483
But listen, how are you doing?

01:08.518 --> 01:10.718
I mean, how does it feel
to be back in the saddle?

01:10.754 --> 01:13.188
<i>Oh John, there's a sweetness in the air,</i>

01:13.223 --> 01:14.389
<i>and I'm not just saying that</i>

01:14.424 --> 01:17.458
because we shoot next
to a baklava factory.

01:17.494 --> 01:18.693
(Snapping) Kids!

01:18.728 --> 01:21.629
Do you wanna put those
magazines back, please?!

01:21.665 --> 01:23.265
No. (Knock on door)

01:23.300 --> 01:25.867
Excellent, Hamza!
Darlings, I must sign off.

01:25.903 --> 01:28.003
I'm finally getting my
tete-a-tete with the director.

01:28.038 --> 01:31.306
He's some up-and-coming pretty
young thing out of New York.

01:31.341 --> 01:32.908
Well, sounds like your kind of people.

01:32.943 --> 01:34.609
Yes! You come up with some real money,

01:34.644 --> 01:36.344
you can attract the best.

01:36.379 --> 01:37.779
Well, zbogom, John!

01:37.815 --> 01:39.380
That's goodbye in the mother tongue!

01:39.416 --> 01:41.249
Okay, well, I'll sign
off too, sweetheart.

01:41.285 --> 01:43.518
Lots to do, but wishing
you an exciting...

01:43.553 --> 01:45.687
(Call beeps off)

01:45.722 --> 01:47.955
Okay, yep. Miss you, too.

01:47.990 --> 01:49.324
She already hung up.

01:49.359 --> 01:50.925
Oh! Burn, Dad!

01:50.960 --> 01:52.104
Oh my God that's so embarrassing,

01:52.128 --> 01:54.195
you must feel ridiculous.

01:54.230 --> 01:55.963
You better remember
which nails you pulled

01:55.998 --> 01:58.433
those wigs from, because your
mother keeps a spreadsheet.

01:58.662 --> 02:03.662
-- Synced and corrected by ChrisKe --

02:05.041 --> 02:08.908
- David? Come here, please.
- (Gasps)

02:08.945 --> 02:11.346
- I have a concern.
- Oh! Um, no.

02:11.381 --> 02:13.548
Your natural deodorant isn't working.

02:13.583 --> 02:15.416
Stop, David! No, come here.

02:15.452 --> 02:16.951
- Sit!
- What?

02:18.722 --> 02:21.333
- Um...
- What?!

02:21.358 --> 02:23.101
I just wanted to make sure
that everything was okay

02:23.125 --> 02:24.640
between you and Patrick.

02:26.302 --> 02:29.503
Yeah! Why? Why? What did...
what did he say to you?

02:29.531 --> 02:31.365
No, nothing. I just got...

02:31.400 --> 02:33.834
scared when I saw your score
on this relationship quiz.

02:33.869 --> 02:35.134
Oh my God!

02:35.170 --> 02:36.481
Because according to M'Lady Magazine,

02:36.505 --> 02:38.049
"How Electric is your Relationship" quiz

02:38.073 --> 02:40.640
from summer 1991, you and Patrick

02:40.676 --> 02:43.577
are "In Need of a
Generator!" Poor thing!

02:43.612 --> 02:46.913
Okay, first of all,
it's Major Lady Magazine,

02:46.948 --> 02:49.483
and second of all, that quiz is garbage.

02:49.518 --> 02:50.917
Mm, totally, David.

02:50.952 --> 02:53.520
This garbage quiz that it looks
like you took more than once.

02:53.555 --> 02:56.590
Yeah, because it's rigged.
You could take it 1000 times

02:56.625 --> 02:57.902
you'd still get the same outcome.

02:57.926 --> 02:59.459
Oh, it's okay, David.

02:59.495 --> 03:01.138
You and Patrick have
settled in to that like,

03:01.162 --> 03:03.530
nine to five life, so
things are probably starting

03:03.565 --> 03:05.599
to feel a little snooze-town.

03:05.634 --> 03:09.168
You're dating a vet who
irons his polo shirts.

03:09.204 --> 03:12.138
Um, Ted and I got
"Electrical Storm." So.

03:13.275 --> 03:16.075
That's impossible. What
did you do to get that?

03:16.111 --> 03:18.611
Did you plug your hairdryer
in with wet hands again?

03:18.646 --> 03:21.680
Hey, that happened
twice David, let it go.

03:21.716 --> 03:24.517
Sorry that we work hard
to keep the sparks flying.

03:24.552 --> 03:25.919
That's disgusting.

03:25.954 --> 03:27.965
We've actually started taking
every Friday afternoon off

03:27.989 --> 03:29.672
to go on "adventure dates."

03:31.359 --> 03:34.493
"Adventure dates" sound like
something a marriage counselor

03:34.529 --> 03:36.495
would proscribe as a last resort.

03:36.531 --> 03:38.431
Okay, fine... I was gonna see

03:38.466 --> 03:40.011
if you guys wanted to
join us this afternoon,

03:40.035 --> 03:42.201
but you probably have
more exciting things to do,

03:42.237 --> 03:45.338
like put price tags on things, and...

03:45.373 --> 03:47.506
It's merchandising day, actually.

03:47.531 --> 03:49.398
Oh!

03:49.444 --> 03:51.410
Where are you going, anyway?

03:51.445 --> 03:53.578
Ted booked a tour of Elm Falls Park,

03:53.613 --> 03:55.613
which is like, a super cute look for us.

03:55.649 --> 03:56.729
Sounds dumb.

03:58.455 --> 04:00.052
Fine, text me the information,

04:00.087 --> 04:01.886
and I'll see if we're interested.

04:01.922 --> 04:04.256
Oh! David? It could be worse.

04:04.291 --> 04:06.955
You guys could be a
"Total Power Failure."

04:07.194 --> 04:08.971
Mm! Eat glass.

04:10.664 --> 04:11.997
(Door slams)

04:12.032 --> 04:14.566
Caw! Caw! My teamster brethren!

04:14.601 --> 04:17.202
Yes, it's me, if you can believe it!

04:18.416 --> 04:20.213
<i>(Dog barks)</i>

04:21.041 --> 04:23.141
<i>(Woman laughs)</i>

04:23.177 --> 04:25.243
(Low hum of chatter)

04:28.524 --> 04:29.690
(Knocks)

04:31.587 --> 04:33.186
(Door latch clicks)

04:34.651 --> 04:36.705
Okay, I told the producers

04:36.730 --> 04:39.331
I would approve background on set.

04:39.356 --> 04:42.691
Oh! And I shall tell them the same.

04:42.929 --> 04:46.197
You must be Blaire. No last name.

04:46.232 --> 04:48.900
Doctor Clara Beatrice
Mandrake at your service.

04:48.935 --> 04:51.870
Middle name wasn't scripted,
but I've done my homework.

04:51.905 --> 04:54.768
Okay. So, you're Rose, then?

04:55.074 --> 04:58.370
Moira Rose. And I see
what's happening here.

04:58.612 --> 05:02.357
Break me down just to build me up again!

05:02.382 --> 05:04.581
Like Stan Kubrick did to Shelley.

05:05.585 --> 05:07.385
Okay, I'm not really into games,

05:07.420 --> 05:09.721
and I'm due on set in an hour,

05:09.756 --> 05:12.023
so can whatever this
is can wait 'til then?

05:12.058 --> 05:15.059
I imagine script revisions
might be something

05:15.094 --> 05:16.327
you'd like to sign off on

05:16.362 --> 05:18.262
before the first clap of the boards.

05:18.297 --> 05:20.245
There's a problem with the script?

05:20.833 --> 05:23.401
Well, just a few character adjustments.

05:23.436 --> 05:25.369
(Laughs) I'm kidding.

05:25.405 --> 05:27.745
The script's a total
dumpster fire, of course.

05:28.174 --> 05:30.441
Hah! If the script were garbage,

05:30.476 --> 05:32.343
I don't believe we'd have signed on.

05:32.378 --> 05:35.112
It's an apocalyptic
fantasy about mutant crows.

05:35.148 --> 05:36.914
I think we all know
what we're making here.

05:36.949 --> 05:39.350
A timely allegory about prejudice.

05:39.385 --> 05:42.053
- Okay, Maura, is it?
- Moira.

05:42.088 --> 05:45.022
My last picture was a $50
million dollar studio project.

05:45.058 --> 05:48.417
I think it's safe to say
that this is not that.

05:48.894 --> 05:51.028
And what exactly is this to you, then?

05:51.064 --> 05:52.784
A trip to Bora Bora.

05:53.533 --> 05:55.854
I see. Bora Bora.

05:56.269 --> 05:58.568
Caroline Kennedy once
called it the Atlantic City

05:58.603 --> 06:00.417
of French Polynesia.

06:00.442 --> 06:02.949
Okay, let's just cash our paychecks,

06:02.974 --> 06:05.557
and pray no one ever sees this, yeah?

06:06.297 --> 06:07.763
(Door slams)

06:08.080 --> 06:09.379
<i>(Dog barks)</i>

06:09.404 --> 06:12.112
(Door opens)
- Morning, Stevie.

06:12.850 --> 06:15.618
I'm just here to submit
my letter of resignation.

06:15.653 --> 06:17.853
Okay, you can just leave
it right here on the desk.

06:17.889 --> 06:19.655
Well, I haven't actually written it yet.

06:19.691 --> 06:22.559
But I guess I can just
dictate it to you right now.

06:22.594 --> 06:24.427
Um, "To whom it may concern."

06:24.463 --> 06:27.197
Sorry Roland, why
exactly are you quitting?

06:27.232 --> 06:29.210
Well, I would rather quit
than come in here every day

06:29.234 --> 06:30.694
and be humiliated!

06:30.719 --> 06:32.547
I mean, I come to work,
and Johnny's out there

06:32.571 --> 06:34.204
doing all my jobs!

06:34.239 --> 06:35.938
Yeah, he's been... buzzing around

06:35.981 --> 06:38.248
- ever since Mrs. Rose left.
- Yeah, exactly!

06:38.276 --> 06:39.642
I mean, come on, what's next?

06:39.677 --> 06:42.544
I go home and he's playing
strip backgammon with my wife?

06:42.580 --> 06:44.013
(Laughs) Come on!

06:44.048 --> 06:46.348
- No, don't talk to me.
- Yeah.

06:46.383 --> 06:47.683
I-I mean, I look in the mirror

06:47.719 --> 06:49.551
and it's Johnny's face
staring back at me?

06:49.587 --> 06:51.220
Got it, Roland. I'll talk to him.

06:51.255 --> 06:53.030
Okay, well, I'll go with you.

06:54.492 --> 06:56.592
Oh, look! This guy's
wearing a work shirt.

06:56.628 --> 06:58.327
He's even copping my look now!

06:58.362 --> 06:59.895
(Scoffs)

06:59.931 --> 07:01.038
Uh...

07:01.966 --> 07:03.699
What ya doin' there, Mr. Rose?

07:03.735 --> 07:06.535
Oh, I noticed there was a bit
of blockage in the gutters.

07:06.570 --> 07:08.437
But um...

07:08.472 --> 07:10.506
Roland's in charge of doing the gutters.

07:10.541 --> 07:12.441
Yeah, I'm the gutter guy, Johnny.

07:12.476 --> 07:14.209
Everybody knows I'm the gutter guy!

07:14.245 --> 07:16.045
Well, it was on the
to-do list for today.

07:16.080 --> 07:17.980
Yeah, it was on my to-do list!

07:18.016 --> 07:19.626
What are you gonna do
next, the bathrooms?!

07:19.650 --> 07:20.927
No, I haven't done the bathrooms.

07:20.951 --> 07:23.317
Jeez, I wouldn't mind
if he did the bathrooms.

07:23.353 --> 07:26.121
Uh, is everything okay, Mr. Rose?

07:26.156 --> 07:28.835
Yeah, never felt better.
I feel invigorated!

07:29.059 --> 07:31.137
Well, maybe you can move
on to cleaning the windows,

07:31.161 --> 07:32.761
and give Roland his job back?

07:32.796 --> 07:34.896
Well, I've already done the windows.

07:34.931 --> 07:37.231
It looks like Roland might
have to find some other work.

07:37.267 --> 07:40.001
Oh jeez. Find some other
work, do you hear him?

07:40.037 --> 07:42.103
What's gonna happen next?
I go to my dermatologist,

07:42.139 --> 07:44.305
and Johnny's there
getting my moles checked?

07:44.340 --> 07:46.641
Stevie: Point made Roland, thank you.

07:46.677 --> 07:48.009
(Bell on door jingles)

07:48.045 --> 07:50.611
(Soft Jazz music plays)

07:51.542 --> 07:53.375
- Oh hi.
- Hi.

07:59.189 --> 08:02.623
Have I ever told you how
sexy it is to walk in here

08:02.659 --> 08:05.459
and see you doing um...

08:05.495 --> 08:07.562
inventory?

08:07.597 --> 08:11.546
And wearing those little
rubber thimbles on your fingers?

08:12.032 --> 08:13.999
They help me flip the pages easier.

08:14.214 --> 08:17.155
Hot. Hot sex.

08:17.907 --> 08:20.249
You know what else is hot and sexy?

08:20.757 --> 08:23.477
Doing something
spontaneous this afternoon.

08:23.513 --> 08:25.346
Ooh, like what?

08:25.381 --> 08:27.429
You helping me with the inventory?

08:27.893 --> 08:30.132
Yes. Or...

08:30.886 --> 08:32.687
taking the afternoon off.

08:32.722 --> 08:34.577
Mixing up the nine to five.

08:35.421 --> 08:36.490
Okay...

08:36.525 --> 08:38.326
well, nine to five are our store hours.

08:38.361 --> 08:41.159
So it's kinda hard to
build customer loyalty

08:41.196 --> 08:43.763
when your store is just like,
spontaneously open or closed.

08:43.798 --> 08:46.633
Yeah. Anyway, it turns out

08:46.668 --> 08:49.202
Alexis's relationship is in trouble.

08:49.238 --> 08:50.903
- What?
- Yeah, I know.

08:50.939 --> 08:53.607
Struggling. She practically
begged us to join them

08:53.642 --> 08:55.475
at the park this afternoon,

08:55.510 --> 08:57.009
probably for emotional support.

08:57.045 --> 08:58.823
Wow, we just saw them,
they seemed totally fine.

08:58.847 --> 09:00.313
I know. Yeah.

09:00.349 --> 09:02.514
Well, they're in need of a generator,

09:02.550 --> 09:04.065
if you know what I mean.

09:04.552 --> 09:06.151
Well, I don't, but uh...

09:06.186 --> 09:07.631
if you think it'll help a bad situation,

09:07.655 --> 09:09.755
I guess we could duck
out a little early today.

09:09.790 --> 09:11.602
It will just mean we'll
have to start early tomorrow.

09:11.626 --> 09:12.893
Mhmm.

09:13.594 --> 09:17.062
You know, it's that unshakable
sense of responsibility

09:17.097 --> 09:19.643
that... makes me wanna just...

09:20.401 --> 09:23.135
rip those little rubber things,

09:23.170 --> 09:25.704
and... burn 'em in a fire.

09:25.740 --> 09:27.005
(Laughs)

09:28.771 --> 09:29.870
(Groans)

09:31.612 --> 09:34.747
Johnny: Twyla, can I get a
lunch special to go, please?

09:34.772 --> 09:36.573
- Sure.
- Okay.

09:36.950 --> 09:39.752
Oh! So no one thought to tell me

09:39.787 --> 09:41.552
about the team lunch today?

09:41.588 --> 09:42.920
Oh, we tried.

09:42.955 --> 09:45.856
You just couldn't hear us over
the sound of the lawnmower.

09:45.892 --> 09:48.559
Yeah, lawnmower, as in mowing the lawn,

09:48.595 --> 09:50.561
which is also my job.

09:50.597 --> 09:53.464
Am I supposed to be reading
between the lines here?

09:53.500 --> 09:57.001
Well, I think we were just
wondering if maybe the fact

09:57.036 --> 10:01.015
that you're so
invigorated to work lately

10:01.040 --> 10:03.508
is because Mrs. Rose is gone,

10:03.543 --> 10:05.075
and you're trying to fill a...

10:05.111 --> 10:07.812
Fill a big, black
empty hole in your life.

10:07.847 --> 10:10.348
Is that pretty much what you
were trying to say there, Stevie?

10:10.383 --> 10:11.982
Maybe not quite like that, but...

10:12.018 --> 10:14.985
Okay, if you're suggesting...
that my work ethic

10:15.032 --> 10:17.265
has anything to do
with... Oh, it's Moira!

10:17.290 --> 10:18.721
I gotta to take this.

10:18.746 --> 10:20.724
Moira, what's the good word?

10:20.759 --> 10:24.295
Oh John, I'm afraid I've made
a grave error in judgment.

10:24.330 --> 10:27.264
Oh sweetheart, I told you
not to drink the tap water.

10:27.300 --> 10:30.534
If only! At this moment
an intestinal bacteria

10:30.569 --> 10:32.736
would wreak less havoc on my career!

10:32.771 --> 10:33.938
Well, I don't understand.

10:33.973 --> 10:35.840
Everything was fine two hours ago.

10:35.875 --> 10:38.542
John, you know me, I'm
never one to complain.

10:38.577 --> 10:41.078
I didn't bat an eye when I
found out my accommodation

10:41.113 --> 10:44.748
here was in actuality a
small "Bed or Breakfast."

10:44.783 --> 10:46.616
They feed me at work, I'll take the bed.

10:46.652 --> 10:47.952
So then what's the problem?

10:47.987 --> 10:51.155
Our director appears to
be on a kamikaze mission

10:51.190 --> 10:52.289
to sink this ship,

10:52.325 --> 10:54.958
and I refuse to be the
goddess on its prow!

10:54.993 --> 10:57.927
Well, if you're not enjoying
yourself anymore sweetheart,

10:57.963 --> 10:59.663
<i>then coming home is always an option.</i>

10:59.698 --> 11:01.598
I mean, you must be missing your family.

11:01.633 --> 11:05.235
Oh, thank you, John, but that's not it.

11:05.270 --> 11:08.605
This was supposed to
be my comeback vehicle,

11:08.640 --> 11:10.407
and opportunities like this

11:10.442 --> 11:12.843
come along ever so infrequently.

11:17.148 --> 11:18.682
Well, Moira,

11:18.717 --> 11:20.831
I feel the answer is
right in front of you.

11:21.387 --> 11:24.220
This isn't some rinky-dink
made-for-TV movie,

11:24.256 --> 11:27.723
or a voice gig for an X-rated
Japanese video game.

11:27.759 --> 11:29.958
That-that was rated
"M" for "Mature," John.

11:29.994 --> 11:33.362
All I'm saying is you
have an opportunity here.

11:33.398 --> 11:36.503
And if you want it bad enough,
you've gotta fight for it.

11:37.862 --> 11:39.751
You're right. You're right!

11:39.776 --> 11:41.370
If Sandy Bullock hadn't fought

11:41.406 --> 11:43.372
to keep the Speed Franchise alive,

11:43.408 --> 11:45.508
we never would've had "Cruise Control".

11:45.543 --> 11:46.876
<i>John, thank you.</i>

11:46.911 --> 11:49.111
I would be lost without you.

11:49.146 --> 11:51.079
(Kiss sound, beeps call off)

11:51.955 --> 11:53.289
Me too.

11:56.993 --> 11:58.387
Everything okay?

11:58.423 --> 11:59.988
Yeah, everything's good, Stevie.

12:00.024 --> 12:02.968
Everything's good. So
I'm gonna head back,

12:02.993 --> 12:06.694
uh, but you can brainstorm
some things for Roland to do.

12:06.730 --> 12:08.563
And if not, I have a window later,

12:08.598 --> 12:11.069
so I can take the job on if you like.

12:11.094 --> 12:12.667
Just so you're aware, Mr. Rose,

12:12.702 --> 12:14.836
the special is cream of mushroom soup.

12:14.871 --> 12:16.749
We don't actually have
to-go containers for that,

12:16.773 --> 12:18.446
so I've just double-bagged it.

12:18.471 --> 12:20.404
Would you like a spoon, or a straw?

12:26.664 --> 12:28.798
(Birds chirp)

12:30.837 --> 12:32.381
I have to say, David,
I'm a little shocked

12:32.405 --> 12:33.504
that you agreed to do this,

12:33.539 --> 12:35.106
I know how fearful you are of heights.

12:35.141 --> 12:36.940
Hmm. Well, "fearful" makes me

12:36.976 --> 12:39.710
sound like some Dickensian
orphan with a chronic illness.

12:39.745 --> 12:41.345
It's more an aversion.

12:41.380 --> 12:44.582
Yeah, do I wish that Alexis
was a little more specific

12:44.617 --> 12:46.683
when she said we were coming to a park?

12:46.729 --> 12:50.631
Uh maybe, but this, this is
gonna be fun, I think for us.

12:50.656 --> 12:52.256
- You know?
- Yeah.

12:52.291 --> 12:54.625
David, you look so cute under there!

12:54.668 --> 12:56.701
Like a tiny toadstool man,

12:56.729 --> 12:59.096
or a little acorn person, or something.

12:59.132 --> 13:01.464
Hey! So glad you guys could make it!

13:01.500 --> 13:02.798
I hope you didn't have to like,

13:02.834 --> 13:05.135
rearrange your daily
schedule, or anything, hm?

13:05.170 --> 13:06.680
Oh, no, no, no, we just agreed to finish

13:06.704 --> 13:08.338
doing the inventory tomorrow.

13:08.373 --> 13:10.640
Mm, that's a sensible decision.

13:10.675 --> 13:11.680
Yeah.

13:13.711 --> 13:15.689
They look like they're really
enjoying each other's company.

13:15.713 --> 13:17.847
Yeah, they fake it well.

13:17.882 --> 13:20.583
I actually did one of
these at summer camp.

13:20.619 --> 13:22.796
Yeah, and I couldn't imagine
who wouldn't want to dangle

13:22.820 --> 13:25.121
20 feet in the air on
a series of shaky logs.

13:25.157 --> 13:27.563
It's actually closer to 30 feet, bud.

13:27.992 --> 13:29.403
David's never done
anything like this before.

13:29.427 --> 13:33.072
- Uh oh, we've got a virgin!
- Okay,

13:33.097 --> 13:36.565
you might wanna talk to half
my birthright trip about that.

13:36.600 --> 13:37.962
All right, do you wanna go first, babe?

13:37.987 --> 13:41.610
- Hundred, babe.
- Oh okay, there we go!

13:41.639 --> 13:43.472
Hey. Mm!

13:44.776 --> 13:46.542
All right.

13:47.611 --> 13:48.944
You feeling okay, David?

13:48.980 --> 13:50.646
You're looking a little flushed.

13:50.682 --> 13:53.415
No, just using a new tinted
moisturizer, that's all.

13:53.450 --> 13:55.151
It's all right.

13:55.186 --> 13:56.852
- I guess I'll go.
- (Laughs) All right!

13:56.888 --> 13:58.298
This will be a fun adventure for us.

13:58.322 --> 13:59.421
Yes...

13:59.456 --> 14:01.724
Get the clip off, and
you're ready to go.

14:01.759 --> 14:05.040
- Babe!
- Whoa, great job, babe!

14:05.462 --> 14:06.929
David!

14:08.822 --> 14:10.989
David!
- Stop!

14:11.014 --> 14:12.681
(David whimpers)

14:12.836 --> 14:15.136
None of my phone chargers are working!

14:15.172 --> 14:16.871
I ask for a pressed juice,

14:16.907 --> 14:18.773
and all I get are blank stares.

14:18.809 --> 14:20.508
Look, I just find it hard to believe

14:20.543 --> 14:22.877
that this was the best
gig you could've gotten me.

14:22.913 --> 14:25.554
Get my days down! Yeah. Hi.

14:25.579 --> 14:26.581
- Hello, again.
- Hi.

14:26.616 --> 14:28.516
I was hoping this might
be an opportune moment

14:28.551 --> 14:29.918
to discuss the quagmire

14:29.953 --> 14:32.721
in which you fancy yourself ensnared?

14:32.756 --> 14:34.089
The what to the what now?

14:34.114 --> 14:37.348
I suspect you're viewing
this enterprise as a barrier

14:37.393 --> 14:39.694
rather than a gateway to
the future of your career.

14:39.730 --> 14:41.262
Yeah, you really don't have to worry

14:41.297 --> 14:43.664
- about the future of my career.
- Is that so?

14:43.700 --> 14:45.365
Because I did a little "Ask Jeeves-ing,"

14:45.400 --> 14:47.334
and you, Sir, were recently cut loose

14:47.369 --> 14:49.970
from a high-profile blockbuster.

14:50.005 --> 14:52.072
We had artistic differences.

14:52.108 --> 14:54.610
You were the artist, and
they were indifferent!

14:54.922 --> 14:56.944
Yes, well, nothing is a
sure thing in this business.

14:56.979 --> 14:58.742
Nothing is a sure thing.

14:58.767 --> 15:00.934
Which is why you should
look at every opportunity

15:00.961 --> 15:03.079
as a pearl in an un-shucked oyster.

15:03.104 --> 15:06.297
I would hardly call this an opportunity!

15:06.455 --> 15:08.955
I-I worked in soaps.

15:09.181 --> 15:10.914
They had me play my own father,

15:10.949 --> 15:13.907
who then became pregnant
despite the vasectomy.

15:14.368 --> 15:16.359
I still hold the record
for the longest-running

15:16.388 --> 15:18.621
demonic possession
on daytime television.

15:18.656 --> 15:19.856
Okay, what's your point?

15:19.892 --> 15:21.516
We were number one.

15:21.993 --> 15:24.194
Every project has potential.

15:24.229 --> 15:26.096
If you allow yourself to see it,

15:26.131 --> 15:27.998
and give it the respect it deserves,

15:28.033 --> 15:30.133
others just may follow suit.

15:32.349 --> 15:34.883
Yeah, I really wouldn't know
where to start with this one.

15:34.908 --> 15:38.180
Hmm, well, here are my revisions.

15:38.883 --> 15:40.343
If you care to discuss them,

15:40.379 --> 15:42.545
I'll be running lines in the nest.

15:45.250 --> 15:46.949
(Blaire sighs heavily)

15:46.974 --> 15:48.974
Hey Stevie, don't mind me.

15:48.999 --> 15:52.333
Just coming in for a
quick cup of rocket fuel.

15:52.601 --> 15:55.302
Nobody drinks that
rocket fuel, Mr. Rose.

15:55.327 --> 15:57.136
I know it tastes like something I found

15:57.161 --> 15:59.261
in that gutter out there, but uh...

15:59.297 --> 16:02.231
it's the pick-me-up I need to
finish reorganizing the shed.

16:02.266 --> 16:03.799
(Exasperated sigh)

16:05.285 --> 16:07.952
You're reorganizing the shed?

16:07.977 --> 16:10.411
That's not on the
calendar 'til next week.

16:10.574 --> 16:12.674
Yeah well, with my evenings free,

16:12.709 --> 16:14.043
I mean, normally at this time

16:14.078 --> 16:17.313
Moira and I are deciding
on dinner plans, but uh...

16:17.348 --> 16:18.580
Okay, Mr. Rose,

16:18.615 --> 16:21.834
I know I might be overstepping here,

16:21.859 --> 16:24.853
but I... just wanted you to know

16:24.888 --> 16:27.077
that it's okay to miss your wife.

16:28.630 --> 16:31.697
No, it's just an adjustment, that's all.

16:31.722 --> 16:34.329
I mean, we're making
adjustments all the time.

16:34.364 --> 16:37.468
Yesterday I couldn't drink
this coffee, and now...

16:42.038 --> 16:45.280
we've been serving this
to guests the whole time?

16:45.376 --> 16:46.609
Mr. Rose,

16:46.634 --> 16:49.511
I-I hope that someday I find someone

16:49.546 --> 16:51.379
who I can stand long enough

16:51.414 --> 16:54.101
to feel a little lost
when they're not around.

16:55.381 --> 16:57.214
(Sighs heavily)

16:57.476 --> 16:59.008
I'm exhausted.

16:59.986 --> 17:02.154
Eight days, Stevie.

17:03.508 --> 17:07.452
That's the longest we've gone
without seeing each other.

17:08.731 --> 17:09.964
No matter where we were,

17:09.999 --> 17:13.066
and... yeah, we've managed to keep it up

17:13.102 --> 17:15.866
for almost 40 years.

17:16.171 --> 17:18.022
Well, see?

17:18.840 --> 17:21.074
It makes sense that you're a little

17:21.109 --> 17:23.116
out of sorts without her.

17:23.141 --> 17:25.123
I'll tell you what's
not out of sorts anymore,

17:25.146 --> 17:27.214
that shed! (Chuckles)

17:27.249 --> 17:29.917
Yeah well, now that
you're done with the shed,

17:29.952 --> 17:34.515
maybe you could start sharing
the jobs with Roland again?

17:35.031 --> 17:38.135
Yeah well, you're right, Stevie,

17:38.160 --> 17:40.249
and I will call Roland.

17:40.562 --> 17:43.607
It's just I'm so tired

17:43.632 --> 17:45.165
From all the work I've been doing,

17:45.200 --> 17:46.702
so I'm thinking...

17:47.102 --> 17:48.868
maybe you could...

17:48.904 --> 17:51.155
No, it's just not my job.

17:53.242 --> 17:54.841
Right.

17:55.817 --> 17:57.450
Patrick: You can do this, David!

17:57.579 --> 17:59.446
Just one step at a time!

17:59.471 --> 18:01.338
You're looking pretty
shaky there, David.

18:01.363 --> 18:04.202
I really hope we didn't
"rope" you into something here.

18:04.554 --> 18:06.797
Alexis: Hey David, just
pretend you're in like,

18:06.821 --> 18:09.088
a super dangerous
walk-and-turn sobriety test.

18:09.123 --> 18:10.489
Okay, I don't like this!

18:10.525 --> 18:11.891
Okay well then, just turn around!

18:11.927 --> 18:14.093
Why would he agree do this
when he's afraid of heights?

18:14.128 --> 18:15.428
He's not afraid of heights,

18:15.463 --> 18:16.807
He's afraid of moths and butterflies.

18:16.831 --> 18:18.230
And businesswomen in sneakers.

18:18.266 --> 18:19.699
Okay, I can hear you!

18:19.734 --> 18:21.100
And also heights,

18:21.135 --> 18:23.180
something to do with him being
broken up with while he was...

18:23.204 --> 18:25.335
Parasailing in the Seychelles!

18:26.274 --> 18:28.085
He and Anderson Cooper were
stuck up there for like,

18:28.109 --> 18:29.841
three hours, until the wind died down.

18:29.877 --> 18:32.343
I totally forgot! Argh!

18:32.390 --> 18:34.523
- I'm sorry, David!
- Aah!

18:34.548 --> 18:36.915
I'm sorry, you were
right, the quiz was rigged.

18:37.757 --> 18:40.185
- What?!
- What quiz?

18:40.220 --> 18:42.788
Okay, David took this relationship quiz,

18:42.823 --> 18:44.823
and it said that his
relationship was like,

18:44.858 --> 18:46.524
in need of some excitement.

18:46.560 --> 18:49.304
- What?!
- David, I lied!

18:49.329 --> 18:51.429
I took the quiz like, 15 times.

18:51.465 --> 18:52.742
"In Need of a Generator" is like,

18:52.766 --> 18:53.932
the only answer you can get.

18:53.968 --> 18:55.433
Oh my God!

18:55.469 --> 18:56.813
Okay, I don't know what this is about,

18:56.837 --> 18:58.870
but this generator is running smoothly.

18:58.906 --> 19:01.206
So we're doing all of
this so that you can prove

19:01.241 --> 19:02.740
our relationship is exciting?

19:02.775 --> 19:04.141
I failed the stupid quiz,

19:04.176 --> 19:06.477
and Alexis made me feel bad about it.

19:06.512 --> 19:07.957
David, you're basically 40 years old,

19:07.981 --> 19:10.581
I shouldn't be able to make
you feel bad about anything.

19:10.617 --> 19:12.049
I love our relationship.

19:12.085 --> 19:13.951
I love it when you order me pizza.

19:13.987 --> 19:16.353
I love when you use
words like inventory!

19:16.388 --> 19:17.866
I even love those stupid rubber things

19:17.890 --> 19:19.356
you put on your fingers,

19:19.391 --> 19:21.558
'cause you think they
flip the pages faster.

19:21.594 --> 19:23.494
They don't flip the pages faster.

19:23.529 --> 19:25.295
They don't flip the pages faster!

19:25.331 --> 19:27.765
- Okay...
- I'm so sorry!

19:28.801 --> 19:30.412
We're gonna talk about
the fact that we missed

19:30.436 --> 19:32.369
half a day of work to make this happen,

19:32.404 --> 19:35.539
But you did just do a tree
walk 30 feet in the air for us.

19:35.574 --> 19:37.608
- Yes, I did.
- Both: Muah!

19:37.643 --> 19:39.443
- (Tired exhale)
- All right, guys,

19:39.478 --> 19:41.978
that's one rope down,
seven courses to go.

19:42.014 --> 19:44.014
- Hey.
- Don't touch me.

19:44.049 --> 19:45.649
No.

19:49.380 --> 19:51.380
***

19:51.773 --> 19:55.775
Soon we will walk once more
walk amongst the humans.

19:55.811 --> 19:58.778
But until that day
comes, we must remember,

19:58.814 --> 20:01.514
the crows don't just have eyes...

20:02.517 --> 20:04.593
we also have wings!

20:04.618 --> 20:07.698
Caaaaw! Awk! Caw! Caw!

20:07.723 --> 20:09.155
- Cut! Cut.
- (Buzzer sounds)

20:09.932 --> 20:12.933
Let me guess, he didn't
like the rewrites,

20:16.130 --> 20:17.726
I don't know why,

20:17.751 --> 20:19.960
or really, even how,

20:19.985 --> 20:23.286
but something about this actually works.

20:25.606 --> 20:27.907
Oh. All right then, then um...

20:27.942 --> 20:31.177
might I ask why did
we interrupt that take?

20:31.212 --> 20:32.422
Right, so at this point Moira,

20:32.446 --> 20:34.213
I'm gonna have a bunch of digital birds

20:34.249 --> 20:35.948
sort of circling around you,

20:35.984 --> 20:37.884
so if you can just be aware of them.

20:37.919 --> 20:40.853
Yes. Aye, Captain. Note taken.

20:40.889 --> 20:42.221
Let's pick it up from there.

20:42.257 --> 20:43.890
In terms of my eye-line,

20:43.925 --> 20:45.999
how many birds am I clocking?

20:46.727 --> 20:49.116
And of them, how many are mutants?

20:50.023 --> 20:51.329
Okay, winging it.

20:51.354 --> 20:53.087
Action!

20:54.735 --> 20:57.069
(Gravelly and shrill)
Listen to me... aaawk!

20:57.094 --> 21:01.507
The day will come when we
are no longer social outcasts!

21:01.532 --> 21:05.703
I am but a tail-feather
away from finding the cure.

21:07.068 --> 21:08.593
So please...

21:09.816 --> 21:11.449
quiet your caws

21:11.484 --> 21:14.151
so that we may take up our cause...

21:14.186 --> 21:15.887
redemption!

21:15.922 --> 21:17.622
Redemption!

21:17.657 --> 21:20.593
Awk! Awk! Ahaaa!

21:20.617 --> 21:25.617
