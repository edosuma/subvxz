00:03.836 --> 00:05.673
Previously on ER:

00:05.705 --> 00:07.308
I was thinking

00:07.341 --> 00:10.344
that maybe we shouldn't
be quite so together here.

00:10.378 --> 00:11.679
Uh, I thought
everybody already knows.

00:11.712 --> 00:13.081
I didn't tell anybody.

00:13.114 --> 00:14.615
Dad's taking me
to Florida.

00:14.648 --> 00:16.417
You can take whatever
you want, I don't care.

00:16.450 --> 00:18.086
He's not going
anywhere with you.

00:18.119 --> 00:19.187
We'll catch the whales
in the Fall, kiddo.

00:19.220 --> 00:20.121
I'm going
the other direction.

00:20.154 --> 00:21.055
What?

00:21.089 --> 00:22.090
( sobbing )

00:23.357 --> 00:25.793
I know what you want
me to say and...

00:25.826 --> 00:27.495
and I can't say it, okay?

00:27.528 --> 00:29.830
But things with Wendall
didn't work out.

00:29.863 --> 00:31.365
Oh. I'm sorry.

00:31.399 --> 00:33.201
Yeah, it's weird.

00:33.234 --> 00:35.103
She's actually
not really even
speaking to me.

00:35.136 --> 00:36.104
( chuckles )

01:04.831 --> 01:05.799
Oh, my God!

01:05.833 --> 01:07.201
What? What?

01:07.235 --> 01:08.736
You have to get up!
Get up! Get up!

01:08.769 --> 01:09.837
What, what, what?

01:09.870 --> 01:11.472
7:32.
Yeah?

01:11.505 --> 01:13.841
Rounds are at 8:00.

01:13.874 --> 01:15.176
I hit the snooze.

01:15.209 --> 01:18.246
No, you shut
the alarm off.

01:18.279 --> 01:20.448
Sorry.

01:20.481 --> 01:21.715
What are you doing?

01:21.749 --> 01:23.184
I thought you were
going to go home

01:23.217 --> 01:24.218
and change into
some other clothes.

01:24.252 --> 01:25.686
No, it's okay.

01:25.719 --> 01:26.854
No, it's going
to look weird.
No, it won't.

01:26.887 --> 01:27.821
Yes, you're back
in the ER now.

01:27.855 --> 01:28.856
People will think that...

01:28.889 --> 01:30.758
What are they
going to think?

01:30.791 --> 01:32.493
That I don't do
my laundry?

01:32.526 --> 01:34.628
That I sleep
in the park?

01:34.662 --> 01:36.630
PRATT:
Donde esta Abby?

01:36.664 --> 01:38.899
What?
Abby needs to take
a few pass-ons.

01:38.932 --> 01:40.868
Ella esta tarde--
"she's late."

01:40.901 --> 01:42.903
Brushing up on
your Spanish, huh?

01:42.936 --> 01:45.239
Helps me relate
to the community better.

01:45.273 --> 01:46.540
Oh, yeah?
What's her name?

01:46.574 --> 01:47.841
Okay, one left.

01:47.875 --> 01:49.277
Asthma going to the ICU.
Needs an art line.

01:49.310 --> 01:50.278
I got it.

01:50.311 --> 01:51.245
Meaning that...?

01:51.279 --> 01:52.646
I'll take care of it.

01:52.680 --> 01:53.847
So you'll teach
the residents how to do it?

01:53.881 --> 01:54.848
Absolutely.

01:54.882 --> 01:56.417
That's the board.

01:56.450 --> 01:57.785
Alex has soccer
after school.

01:57.818 --> 01:59.353
I thought maybe you
could drop him off.

01:59.387 --> 02:00.621
Isn't the carpool
picking him up?

02:00.654 --> 02:01.889
Yeah, but you know,

02:01.922 --> 02:03.291
he needs to work
on his corner kick.

02:03.324 --> 02:04.558
He's still
pretty mad at me.

02:04.592 --> 02:07.228
Well, think of it
as an ice-breaker.

02:07.261 --> 02:09.562
Maybe we should
give it a little
more time, huh?

02:09.597 --> 02:10.764
I'll see you tonight.

02:10.798 --> 02:13.634
All right. Have a good nap.

02:13.667 --> 02:14.668
Morris!

02:14.702 --> 02:16.237
Sorry!

02:16.270 --> 02:19.240
I came in to work
on our manuscript revisions.

02:19.273 --> 02:20.908
Yeah, we'll see
if I have the time.

02:20.941 --> 02:22.643
They're due by 5:00 P.M.

02:22.676 --> 02:23.944
Today?

02:23.977 --> 02:25.279
Yeah. We don't want
to miss the deadline.

02:25.313 --> 02:26.480
You two are
publishing?

02:26.514 --> 02:28.616
"Oligoanalgesia
in Long Bone Fractures:

02:28.649 --> 02:30.384
A Retrospective Review."

02:30.418 --> 02:31.919
Accepted in
the Annals next month

02:31.952 --> 02:33.387
if we can make a few changes.

02:33.421 --> 02:35.223
Some substantial changes.

02:35.256 --> 02:36.690
Why don't you go to the
Doctor's Lounge and get started?

02:36.724 --> 02:37.691
I'll be right in.

02:37.725 --> 02:40.228
Consider it done.

02:40.261 --> 02:41.895
( quietly ):
You're working
with Morris?

02:41.929 --> 02:43.564
Yeah, you know,
he's thorough,

02:43.597 --> 02:45.366
good with statistics...

02:45.399 --> 02:47.568
And the only resident
desperate enough
to write it up?

02:47.601 --> 02:49.403
You got it.

02:49.437 --> 02:50.838
Doctor Lewis,
I was wondering
how you'd feel

02:50.871 --> 02:52.406
about letting me run
a trauma today.

02:52.440 --> 02:53.941
Do you think
you're ready for that?

02:53.974 --> 02:55.443
Well, in a couple
of months I'll be an R-2

02:55.476 --> 02:57.678
supervising the interns.

02:57.711 --> 02:59.380
I thought it might be good
to get some practice.

02:59.413 --> 03:00.248
ZADRO:
Hypothermia and syncope.

03:00.281 --> 03:02.250
All yours.

03:03.251 --> 03:04.452
Elena Tobajas, 39,

03:04.485 --> 03:06.387
passed out at
the Immigration Building.

03:06.420 --> 03:07.555
Tachy at 120.
She's cold.

03:07.588 --> 03:08.989
Some kind
of a protest.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.724
You need to call Benjamin Coe.
He's my lawyer.

03:10.758 --> 03:12.260
What?

03:12.293 --> 03:14.262
Don't do anything
until he's here.

03:14.295 --> 03:16.430
CBC, chem panel, EKG,
a liter of warm saline,

03:16.464 --> 03:17.898
O2 at two liters
and get a rectal temp.

03:17.931 --> 03:19.600
What are you doing?

03:19.633 --> 03:20.668
We're going to give you
some warm I.V. fluid.

03:20.701 --> 03:22.270
Don't do that.

03:22.270 --> 03:24.272
It will help.
No.

03:24.272 --> 03:25.439
What?

03:25.473 --> 03:26.940
I'm on a hunger strike.

03:26.974 --> 03:28.676
They want to deport my son.

03:28.709 --> 03:29.810
Elena, you're cold

03:29.843 --> 03:31.379
and dehydrated.

03:31.412 --> 03:32.846
Maybe now the INS will give us
a new hearing.

03:32.880 --> 03:36.450
Do you know the risks
of refusing our care?

03:36.484 --> 03:39.320
Do you know
that you could go
into a coma and die?

03:39.353 --> 03:42.923
I don't want to lose my son.

03:45.459 --> 03:47.461
Okay, cancel all the orders.

03:47.495 --> 03:49.697
No fluid bolus?

03:49.730 --> 03:50.731
No labs, no EKG?

03:50.764 --> 03:53.801
You heard her.
Nothing.

03:55.936 --> 03:58.439
JAKE:
No one is going to remember
what I was wearing yesterday.

03:58.472 --> 03:59.440
People notice.

03:59.473 --> 04:00.474
Watch out.

04:00.508 --> 04:02.476
( laughs )

04:02.510 --> 04:03.544
Are you all right?

04:03.577 --> 04:04.745
Yep.

04:04.778 --> 04:05.479
Morning, Jake.

04:05.513 --> 04:06.480
Hey, Liza.

04:06.514 --> 04:07.781
How's the ER?

04:07.815 --> 04:09.817
Good. This is Abby,
my girlfriend.

04:09.850 --> 04:11.552
Liza's the night clerk
on surgery.

04:11.585 --> 04:12.653
Hi.
Hi.

04:12.686 --> 04:13.654
We're kind of late.

04:13.687 --> 04:14.755
Oh, me, too.

04:14.788 --> 04:17.024
Hey, stop by sometime.

04:18.392 --> 04:19.660
Did you say,
"girlfriend?"

04:19.692 --> 04:21.394
What?

04:21.428 --> 04:25.366
Nothing. Takes me
right back to
junior high.

04:25.399 --> 04:26.800
( chuckles )

04:26.834 --> 04:28.502
What do you want
me to call you?

04:28.536 --> 04:30.438
How about introducing me
as "Abby?"

04:30.471 --> 04:32.640
You don't want
people to know
we're going out?

04:32.673 --> 04:33.674
We're late.

04:33.707 --> 04:36.610
Look, this is important.

04:36.644 --> 04:38.779
Well, let's just talk
about it later?

04:44.585 --> 04:47.054
Yeah. Yeah, I guess
it can wait.

05:38.071 --> 05:39.106
You look ridiculous.

05:39.139 --> 05:40.674
What was I supposed
to do?

05:40.708 --> 05:42.576
They only had small
and extra large.

05:42.610 --> 05:43.911
What's up, homie?

05:43.944 --> 05:45.413
Buenos tardes.

05:45.446 --> 05:46.414
Sorry about being late.

05:46.447 --> 05:47.147
Nice scrubs.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.682
You know, you two

05:48.716 --> 05:49.983
should coordinate your outfits
every day.

05:50.017 --> 05:51.585
Yeah, it's cute.

05:51.619 --> 05:53.921
Maybe we can find you
matching stethoscopes.

05:53.954 --> 05:56.457
Victim of assault for Abby,

05:56.490 --> 05:58.492
and low blood sugar
for your boy toy.

05:58.526 --> 06:00.694
Okay, all right,
all right.

06:00.728 --> 06:02.896
It's rough when everyone knows
you're an item.

06:02.930 --> 06:04.164
That could work.
What?

06:04.197 --> 06:07.067
"This is Abby.
She's my item."

06:07.100 --> 06:08.101
96.1.

06:08.135 --> 06:09.737
Do you want a warm blanket?

06:09.770 --> 06:12.540
Please. I'm thirsty.

06:12.573 --> 06:13.741
Some orange juice?

06:13.774 --> 06:15.075
Only water.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.746
Elena?

06:18.779 --> 06:20.514
Amigo.

06:20.548 --> 06:22.650
I'm Benjamin Coe,
from Legal Aid.

06:22.683 --> 06:23.717
I'm Dr. Lewis.

06:23.751 --> 06:25.786
How's she doing?

06:25.819 --> 06:27.788
Malnourished and dehydrated.
Heading for a coma.

06:27.821 --> 06:30.691
Maybe we'll see
some movement now.

06:30.724 --> 06:33.461
This should finally
get the INS to grant
us a new hearing.

06:33.494 --> 06:34.595
Her son's an illegal alien?

06:34.628 --> 06:35.829
"Undocumented immigrant."

06:35.863 --> 06:36.830
They can just send
the kids back

06:36.864 --> 06:38.566
without their parents?

06:38.599 --> 06:40.734
Elena has her green card.
She came here in '89.

06:40.768 --> 06:43.003
Her brother brought
Santiago up through
Mexico seven years ago.

06:43.036 --> 06:44.204
How'd the INS get involved?

06:44.237 --> 06:45.873
Santiago got into trouble--

06:45.906 --> 06:47.475
attempted robbery.

06:47.475 --> 06:49.577
They locked him up
for two years in Juvie.

06:49.610 --> 06:50.811
Once he did his time,

06:50.844 --> 06:53.113
they transferred him
to Immigration.

06:53.146 --> 06:55.483
He won't last in El Salvador.

06:55.516 --> 06:57.551
The police there
round up gang members.

06:57.585 --> 06:58.886
Sometimes they get beaten
to death,

06:58.919 --> 06:59.953
sometimes they just disappear.

07:01.622 --> 07:03.156
If he goes home,
they'll kill him.

07:03.190 --> 07:04.625
I brought her
durable power.

07:04.658 --> 07:06.494
What's that?

07:06.494 --> 07:09.530
It says that she's competent
to start a hunger strike

07:09.563 --> 07:11.599
and refused nutrition
even if she's unconscious.

07:11.632 --> 07:13.667
We can't even give her an I.V.?

07:13.701 --> 07:15.869
That would be
felony assault.

07:15.903 --> 07:17.204
If you try to treat her,
I'll call the police.

07:17.237 --> 07:19.507
CARTER:
We need a kitchen.

07:19.540 --> 07:20.741
Well, the staff break room

07:20.774 --> 07:22.142
can accommodate
a refrigerator and...

07:22.175 --> 07:23.844
No. I mean a
commercial kitchen.

07:23.877 --> 07:26.213
The HIV daycare program
should be able

07:26.246 --> 07:27.915
to provide a hot lunch.

07:27.948 --> 07:30.951
I'll mention that
to the architect.

07:30.984 --> 07:33.887
So, John, if you're okay,
we're ready

07:33.921 --> 07:36.590
to go to contractors for bid.

07:38.592 --> 07:42.195
I'm thinking $150 million
is in the ballpark.

07:42.229 --> 07:46.066
That's a nice ballpark.

07:46.099 --> 07:48.869
A leadership gift
from the Carter Foundation

07:48.902 --> 07:50.771
would help to get
the ball rolling,

07:50.804 --> 07:53.841
and we've drawn up a list
of potential corporate donors.

07:53.874 --> 07:56.176
We were hoping
that you could make
some calls

07:56.209 --> 07:57.878
on the hospital's behalf.

07:57.911 --> 07:59.980
No, thanks.

08:00.013 --> 08:01.949
Your personal involvement

08:01.982 --> 08:04.217
would be very useful
in contacting...

08:04.251 --> 08:07.588
We weren't happy with the idea
of corporate sponsorship,

08:07.621 --> 08:08.989
so we would be

08:09.022 --> 08:12.826
interested in covering
the construction cost.

08:12.860 --> 08:14.061
The entire thing?

08:15.863 --> 08:17.665
Plus an endowment

08:17.698 --> 08:19.600
to supply the Center's
annual budget

08:19.633 --> 08:22.269
to treat uninsured patients.

08:22.302 --> 08:25.305
This is an incredibly
generous offer.

08:25.338 --> 08:27.708
We would appreciate
a naming opportunity.

08:27.741 --> 08:31.144
Of course.
Do you have some suggestions?

08:31.178 --> 08:33.145
I do, actually.

08:33.179 --> 08:35.182
But I would like
to discuss it further

08:35.215 --> 08:37.851
with a few family members first.

08:37.885 --> 08:39.019
To the side...

08:39.052 --> 08:41.020
up and down.

08:41.054 --> 08:42.856
How many times
did you get punched?

08:42.890 --> 08:43.890
Just once.

08:43.924 --> 08:45.258
Then he grabbed
her purse.

08:45.292 --> 08:46.860
Where did this happen?

08:46.894 --> 08:48.596
Wabash.
23rd.

08:48.629 --> 08:51.064
It wa-wa-was near the corner.

08:52.199 --> 08:54.267
Did you file a police report?

08:54.301 --> 08:55.703
What's the point?

08:55.736 --> 08:57.805
They might catch
the guy.

08:57.838 --> 09:00.207
We didn't get a
good look at him.

09:00.240 --> 09:02.743
Okay, I'm going
to take you to X ray.

09:02.776 --> 09:04.111
Want to look
this way?

09:07.347 --> 09:09.316
Can-can I stay with her?

09:09.349 --> 09:11.151
Uh, no, I'm sorry.

09:11.184 --> 09:13.320
Chuny, maybe Rebecca
would like some coffee.

09:13.353 --> 09:14.622
Can I have tea?

09:14.655 --> 09:16.356
Sure. You want
to come with me?

09:16.389 --> 09:19.026
Stay out
of trouble, sweetie.

09:19.059 --> 09:20.694
Okay, Roberta,
I just have

09:20.728 --> 09:22.630
a couple more questions
for you.

09:22.663 --> 09:26.066
Birdy. Everybody
calls me Birdy.

09:26.099 --> 09:28.301
Um, who do you live with?

09:28.335 --> 09:30.003
Just my sister and me.

09:30.037 --> 09:32.005
Been that way
for 50 years.

09:32.039 --> 09:34.374
Is there anything
you want to tell me?

09:34.407 --> 09:37.210
Like what?

09:37.244 --> 09:42.315
Like, sometimes people are
injured by their friends

09:42.349 --> 09:43.717
or their family members.

09:43.751 --> 09:47.154
It was a kid. Just some punk.

09:47.187 --> 09:50.758
Are you sure?

09:50.791 --> 09:52.159
You feel safe
at home?

09:52.192 --> 09:54.194
Of course.

09:55.996 --> 10:00.834
Okay, I'm going
to order your X rays.

10:04.404 --> 10:06.874
I left a voicemail
for the caseworker at the INS.

10:06.907 --> 10:08.809
When she calls back,
can you talk to her?

10:08.842 --> 10:10.010
And say what?

10:10.043 --> 10:11.111
Hey, Frank?
Hold on.

10:11.144 --> 10:12.880
Just tell them
how sick she is.

10:12.913 --> 10:14.782
Doctor Lewis, I converted
the tables to a TIFF file.

10:14.815 --> 10:15.783
You removed
the P-values?

10:15.816 --> 10:17.818
Oh, crap.

10:17.851 --> 10:19.219
Morris, they want the
differences expressed
as relative risk.

10:19.252 --> 10:20.320
I'll be back.

10:20.353 --> 10:21.689
Well, page Social Work again.

10:21.722 --> 10:23.791
I need a facial series in 4-B.

10:23.824 --> 10:25.192
For Birdy?
You know her?

10:25.225 --> 10:27.294
She and her
sister panhandle
out on Wabash.

10:27.327 --> 10:29.162
I give them a buck
once in a while.

10:29.196 --> 10:31.799
It's a travesty
what we let happen
to the elderly.

10:31.832 --> 10:34.301
Hey, Wendall, I have
a consult for you.

10:34.334 --> 10:36.103
The hunger-strike lady?

10:36.136 --> 10:37.370
Oh, yeah,
that's mine. Sorry.
Elena Tobajas?

10:37.404 --> 10:39.006
Yeah, I read about her.
You did?

10:39.039 --> 10:40.674
She was in the newspaper
a few weeks ago.

10:40.708 --> 10:42.175
Something about trying
to get asylum for her son.

10:42.209 --> 10:43.310
A few weeks?

10:43.343 --> 10:44.712
I had pancakes
for breakfast.

10:44.745 --> 10:45.946
I'm starving already.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.314
I don't know
what to say, John.

10:47.347 --> 10:49.382
Well, I've been looking
for some time

10:49.416 --> 10:51.318
for the right thing
to donate to.

10:51.351 --> 10:52.686
Seemed only fitting.

10:52.720 --> 10:54.955
Have you thought
about any future role

10:54.988 --> 10:56.256
in the Outpatient Center?

10:56.289 --> 10:58.325
Yeah, I'd like
to sit on the board,

10:58.358 --> 11:00.794
and I suppose I might
see a few patients.

11:00.828 --> 11:02.262
But you'd agree
it'd be better

11:02.295 --> 11:05.098
to recruit someone
with more experience
as director?

11:05.132 --> 11:07.367
Definitely.

11:07.400 --> 11:10.103
Yeah, I don't want
to run the place, Kerry.

11:10.137 --> 11:11.204
Too much paperwork.

11:11.238 --> 11:13.040
Good. I've identified

11:13.073 --> 11:14.975
four outstanding
candidates.

11:15.008 --> 11:17.978
Oh. Well, I'd be happy
to look over their C.V.'s,

11:18.011 --> 11:19.747
but I've actually
been talking

11:19.747 --> 11:20.914
to Todd Becker.

11:20.948 --> 11:22.015
Todd Becker
from Stanford?

11:22.049 --> 11:23.784
Well, he's at Columbia now

11:23.817 --> 11:25.385
and he's set up a network
of clinics in Harlem

11:25.418 --> 11:26.453
and the South Bronx.

11:26.486 --> 11:28.188
He'd be perfect.

11:28.221 --> 11:29.489
Why are you are doing this?

11:29.522 --> 11:31.291
He'd be a great director.

11:31.324 --> 11:33.093
No, I mean
the whole thing,

11:33.126 --> 11:35.162
the center,
the $150 million.

11:35.195 --> 11:36.930
What's going on?

11:36.964 --> 11:38.365
The city needs it.

11:38.398 --> 11:40.100
There's no prevention,
there's no primary care.

11:40.133 --> 11:41.935
The whole system's broken.

11:41.969 --> 11:45.873
Well, that's not new.
Why now?

11:45.906 --> 11:47.941
Because for 11 years
I've been here

11:47.975 --> 11:49.910
patching up these people
who fall through the cracks

11:49.943 --> 11:51.779
and it hasn't been enough.

11:51.779 --> 11:52.913
I want to do more.

11:52.946 --> 11:53.981
Doctor Carter,

11:54.014 --> 11:55.415
tier two trauma.
MVC?

11:55.448 --> 11:56.784
Fell down a flight
of stairs.

11:56.784 --> 11:58.786
Chest and hip pain.
Good vitals.

11:58.786 --> 12:00.020
Okay, why don't you guys
get started?

12:00.053 --> 12:01.288
I'll be right there.

12:01.321 --> 12:02.322
So you'll send me
that file?

12:02.355 --> 12:03.356
What's that?

12:03.390 --> 12:04.024
The guy from Columbia?

12:04.057 --> 12:05.425
Todd Becker.

12:05.458 --> 12:06.994
You're going to love him,
Kerry, I promise.

12:07.027 --> 12:08.028
Hey.
Hi.

12:08.061 --> 12:09.496
How are you?

12:09.529 --> 12:10.864
I'm okay.

12:10.898 --> 12:11.865
I'm going to
finish an eval

12:11.899 --> 12:14.067
before Psych gets here.

12:16.236 --> 12:18.538
RAY:
Trauma panel, C-spine,
chest and pelvis.

12:18.571 --> 12:21.041
Type and cross for two.

12:21.074 --> 12:23.043
PRATT:
You fell down the whole
flight of stairs?

12:23.076 --> 12:25.412
From the very top.

12:25.445 --> 12:27.014
Was there carpeting?

12:27.047 --> 12:28.381
Cement.

12:28.415 --> 12:30.017
I slipped while I was mopping.

12:30.050 --> 12:31.118
Pulse ox 92.

12:31.151 --> 12:32.419
Decreased
breath sounds here.

12:32.452 --> 12:34.354
What's this going to cost?

12:34.387 --> 12:36.556
That's what
insurance is for.

12:36.589 --> 12:37.925
I don't have any.

12:37.958 --> 12:39.526
Worker's comp will cover it.

12:39.559 --> 12:41.361
I'm a temp.

12:41.394 --> 12:44.965
Once a month, they pay me
$50 to clean the warehouse.

12:44.998 --> 12:46.399
Well, you're at County,
we'll take care of you.

12:46.433 --> 12:48.401
Could you put your
right leg down, please?

12:48.435 --> 12:50.904
I-I can't.

12:50.938 --> 12:52.840
Looks like
posterior hip.

12:54.541 --> 12:56.476
I should go home and rest.

12:56.509 --> 12:58.411
It just feels like a bruise.

12:58.445 --> 13:00.213
Mrs. Graham,
you have a collapsed lung,

13:00.247 --> 13:01.514
your hip is out of joint

13:01.548 --> 13:02.883
and you could be
bleeding internally.

13:02.916 --> 13:04.517
I'm okay.

13:04.551 --> 13:06.186
Jake, chest tube
on the left.
Got it.

13:06.219 --> 13:07.187
Ray, you take
the hip.

13:07.220 --> 13:08.956
Ten of etomidate.

13:08.989 --> 13:12.559
Please, just-just-just
take all this stuff off of me.

13:12.592 --> 13:14.061
Ma'am, ma'am...

13:14.094 --> 13:15.562
Listen, there's been

13:15.595 --> 13:17.364
a head trauma, she's
not thinking clearly.

13:17.397 --> 13:18.465
Yes, I am.
No, you're not.

13:18.498 --> 13:20.133
Keep going.

13:20.167 --> 13:22.402
You'll thank us later for this,
ma'am.

13:22.435 --> 13:24.504
WENDALL:
I spoke to Psychiatry.

13:24.537 --> 13:27.274
They support her competency
to refuse nutrition.

13:27.307 --> 13:28.541
Even if she's unconscious?

13:28.575 --> 13:29.576
Even then.

13:29.609 --> 13:30.878
So we're all in agreement?

13:30.911 --> 13:32.212
No treatment, right?

13:32.245 --> 13:33.513
Dr. Lewis,
she's seizing!

13:33.546 --> 13:35.548
RASGOTRA:
Probably hyponatremia.

13:35.582 --> 13:37.250
You need to let
this happen.

13:37.284 --> 13:38.585
Her only intake has been water.

13:38.618 --> 13:40.087
Her serum sodium is too low.

13:40.120 --> 13:41.488
Got a good vein here.

13:41.521 --> 13:42.890
What are you doing?
Keeping her alive.

13:42.890 --> 13:44.291
She doesn't want to be treated.

13:44.324 --> 13:45.292
Sam...

13:45.325 --> 13:46.526
A patient takes
an overdose,

13:46.559 --> 13:47.995
we tie them down
against their will

13:48.028 --> 13:49.229
and pump their stomach.

13:49.262 --> 13:50.330
But we're gonna let
this woman die?

13:50.363 --> 13:51.965
Yeah, what's
the difference?

13:51.999 --> 13:53.466
She isn't suicidal,
she wasn't depressed.

13:53.500 --> 13:54.935
She's motivated by her desire

13:54.968 --> 13:56.136
to achieve an end,

13:56.169 --> 13:57.637
not by a desire
to kill herself.

13:57.670 --> 13:59.339
Same outcome.
We have to respect
her autonomy.

13:59.372 --> 14:01.508
We have a duty to act
in her best interest.

14:01.541 --> 14:03.476
Heart rate's up,
poor air exchange,

14:03.510 --> 14:06.013
and she's getting dusky.
Dr. Lewis?

14:06.046 --> 14:08.315
What do you want to do?

14:08.348 --> 14:09.649
How about oxygen?
Nothing.

14:09.682 --> 14:10.918
Five liters.

14:10.918 --> 14:12.352
Dr. Lewis...

14:12.385 --> 14:14.087
It's a comfort measure,
it won't save her life.

14:14.121 --> 14:15.923
Go ahead.
We may not like
what she's doing

14:15.923 --> 14:18.158
but she has
the right to do it.

14:18.191 --> 14:19.359
How long can this
go on for?

14:19.392 --> 14:20.627
RASGOTRA:
After 30 minutes

14:20.660 --> 14:22.595
there's a very high risk
of brain damage.

14:22.629 --> 14:23.663
Ah, she's bleeding.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.198
Oh, God.

14:25.232 --> 14:27.500
Can somebody find out
if the INS has called?

14:27.534 --> 14:29.236
She bit her tongue.
Yankauer.

14:29.269 --> 14:31.171
What is that? Stop!

14:31.204 --> 14:32.973
Ativan, two milligrams.

14:33.006 --> 14:34.241
Neela!

14:34.274 --> 14:35.342
We have a legal document

14:35.375 --> 14:37.077
stating that
she did not want

14:37.110 --> 14:39.146
to be treated for
the consequences of her fast.

14:39.179 --> 14:40.613
Neela, out of the room.

14:40.647 --> 14:42.082
It could've saved
her life.

14:42.115 --> 14:44.051
Thank you.
You're off the case.

14:51.691 --> 14:52.392
Your sedative's going to wear
off in about two minutes.

14:52.425 --> 14:53.493
32 French.

14:53.526 --> 14:54.527
It won't budge.

14:54.561 --> 14:55.595
Keep going.

14:55.628 --> 14:56.997
( groans )

14:57.030 --> 14:58.131
I can't get this.

14:58.165 --> 14:59.432
Try the Whistler technique.

14:59.466 --> 15:01.969
I, uh, don't
know that one.

15:05.305 --> 15:09.977
All right, your arm goes under
the bad knee, over the good one.

15:10.010 --> 15:11.544
You stabilize the ankle
with your right hand.

15:11.578 --> 15:13.013
Okay to pass
the chest tube?

15:13.046 --> 15:14.447
Check the tract and wait.

15:14.481 --> 15:16.083
Chuny, would you come over
here and help me with this?

15:16.116 --> 15:17.484
Matter of fact...

15:17.517 --> 15:18.718
I'll stabilize the pelvis.

15:18.751 --> 15:20.620
Ray, get in the position
I was just in.

15:20.653 --> 15:22.455
Okay.

15:22.489 --> 15:24.391
I can feel lung tissue.
She's starting
to wake up.

15:24.424 --> 15:25.993
( groans )
Okay. Listen...

15:26.026 --> 15:27.194
Your arm's a lever.

15:27.227 --> 15:28.628
Stand up straight
and the femoral head

15:28.661 --> 15:30.463
will slip over
the acetabular rim.

15:33.066 --> 15:34.134
Was that it?

15:34.167 --> 15:36.003
I heard a pop.

15:36.036 --> 15:37.070
You got it.

15:37.104 --> 15:38.338
Good job, Pratt. Ray.

15:38.371 --> 15:40.040
All right,
let's fix her lung.

15:41.341 --> 15:42.475
There's some resistance.

15:42.509 --> 15:43.676
Give it a little
more muscle.

15:45.045 --> 15:46.279
Hey, man.

15:46.313 --> 15:47.280
Nice.

15:47.314 --> 15:48.481
What are you doing?

15:48.515 --> 15:49.416
Pull your pants up.

15:49.449 --> 15:50.450
Sterile gloves.

15:50.483 --> 15:51.751
That's a bummer.

15:51.784 --> 15:52.719
Dr. Pratt, do you think
you could, uh...?

15:52.752 --> 15:55.188
Hell no.

15:55.222 --> 15:56.556
Ray?

15:56.589 --> 16:00.393
No, I need to do
a post reduction exam.

16:00.427 --> 16:01.461
Chuny?

16:01.494 --> 16:04.031
That would be sexual harassment.

16:04.064 --> 16:06.433
Okay, all right,
thank you very much,
everybody.

16:06.466 --> 16:08.035
Oh-silk, please.

16:08.035 --> 16:09.469
LOCKHART:
Yes, Roberta and Rebecca

16:09.502 --> 16:11.638
Chaddock, all in-patient...

16:11.671 --> 16:14.574
records and ER visits
for the past year.

16:14.607 --> 16:16.743
Thanks.

16:16.776 --> 16:18.511
Anybody to present?

16:18.545 --> 16:19.779
Uh... yes.

16:19.812 --> 16:21.514
Elder assault,
possible abuse.

16:21.548 --> 16:23.450
Social services on it?

16:23.483 --> 16:27.054
Um... yes, and I'm reviewing
all the old charts.

16:27.054 --> 16:28.521
Abby, I'm all yours.

16:28.555 --> 16:31.091
I was just filling
in Dr. Carter.

16:31.124 --> 16:32.292
I can come back.

16:32.325 --> 16:34.261
No, that's okay.

16:34.294 --> 16:36.229
Um, why don't you two
go see the patient,

16:36.263 --> 16:38.065
and you can bring me
up to speed later.

16:40.100 --> 16:41.068
Okay.

16:42.835 --> 16:44.437
My head hurts.

16:44.471 --> 16:45.738
Yeah, that's from
the seizure.

16:45.772 --> 16:47.440
Elena, I don't know
how much longer

16:47.474 --> 16:49.176
your body can take this.

16:49.209 --> 16:51.078
Do you have to do that again?

16:52.512 --> 16:55.582
We're trying to respect
your wishes...

16:55.615 --> 16:59.119
But I would hate for you
to do this unnecessarily.

16:59.152 --> 17:03.290
It's not unnecessary
if it helps save Santiago.

17:03.323 --> 17:05.291
What if they don't
give you a hearing?

17:05.325 --> 17:07.359
You really want your son
to have to live with your death

17:07.394 --> 17:10.230
on his conscience?

17:10.262 --> 17:13.133
I wasn't there
when he was little.

17:13.165 --> 17:17.404
My husband was killed
in the war, so I came here.

17:17.436 --> 17:20.473
I sent Santiago money
for seven years.

17:20.507 --> 17:23.276
When he was 12,
I got tired

17:23.310 --> 17:27.114
of waiting for the papers
to come through.

17:27.146 --> 17:28.615
He was old enough,

17:28.648 --> 17:34.121
so my brother Alfonso
snuck him in.

17:34.121 --> 17:36.456
You've done everything
you could.

17:36.489 --> 17:40.360
You don't have to do this,
let us treat you.

17:40.393 --> 17:42.629
I'm so tired.

17:45.398 --> 17:46.833
We'll let you rest.

17:54.907 --> 17:57.177
I can't believe she has
to go through with this.

17:57.210 --> 17:59.379
She's a mother trying
to save her son.

17:59.412 --> 18:01.748
I'd throw myself in front
of a train for Cosmo.

18:04.151 --> 18:06.353
Ella esta en el coche
afuera.

18:06.386 --> 18:08.755
Y... ella esta embarazada
y ya, ya viene!

18:08.788 --> 18:10.257
Where's Chuny?

18:10.290 --> 18:12.192
Ahorita, señorita, ahorita,
por favor.

18:12.225 --> 18:14.594
Que me ayude.
Mi esposa...
esta afuera en el coche.

18:14.627 --> 18:15.828
Ella esta en trabajo.

18:15.862 --> 18:17.464
Okay, all right.
We need a BOA kit.

18:17.497 --> 18:19.432
His wife's having a baby?

18:26.573 --> 18:28.441
( cries )

18:28.475 --> 18:29.609
Habla ingles, senora?

18:29.642 --> 18:31.478
Ai...!

18:31.511 --> 18:32.812
Voy a examinar, okay?

18:32.845 --> 18:33.913
Should I get a gurney?

18:33.946 --> 18:35.415
She's crowning.

18:35.448 --> 18:37.450
We need a bulb syringe
and some towels.

18:37.484 --> 18:39.419
( groans )
Okay, now push it
for me, mama.

18:39.452 --> 18:40.920
Okay? Come on, push it.

18:40.953 --> 18:42.522
Push...

18:42.555 --> 18:43.890
Uh... puta.

18:43.923 --> 18:45.258
Come on, puta.

18:45.292 --> 18:46.526
Puta.

18:46.559 --> 18:47.727
( cries )
Come on, puta.

18:47.760 --> 18:48.761
Eh?

18:48.795 --> 18:49.896
Que llamo mi esposa?!

18:49.929 --> 18:52.499
What?
Que llamo mi esposa?!

18:52.532 --> 18:54.767
Esta mi esposa... puta!
What the hell
you doing, man?!

18:54.801 --> 18:56.536
You crazy?!
Get off me!
Llamaste mi esposa puta!

18:56.569 --> 18:57.937
Respire.

18:57.970 --> 19:01.274
Va a empujar...
( men yelling )

19:01.308 --> 19:02.909
What the hell is the
matter with this dude?

19:02.942 --> 19:04.444
"Puje" means push.

19:04.477 --> 19:05.578
You said "puta."

19:05.612 --> 19:06.713
What's that mean?

19:06.746 --> 19:08.215
You called his wife a whore.

19:09.616 --> 19:10.783
Okay, here we go, honey.

19:10.817 --> 19:12.652
Calmate.

19:12.685 --> 19:13.653
Hey, Dr. Lewis.

19:13.686 --> 19:15.422
I'm just getting coffee.

19:15.455 --> 19:17.424
Chuck's on line two.
Sounds like Cosmo's sick.

19:17.457 --> 19:18.558
With what?

19:18.591 --> 19:20.227
No, I'm at
the hospital now.

19:20.260 --> 19:21.494
Okay, I'll take it
in the lounge.

19:21.528 --> 19:22.929
I've got the doctor
right here.

19:22.962 --> 19:24.664
Wait, wait, I prepared
the new bar graphs.

19:24.697 --> 19:26.233
Morris, this is
not a good time.

19:26.233 --> 19:27.867
We got four hours before
we have to turn it in.

19:27.900 --> 19:30.737
Did you include the 95%
confidence intervals?

19:30.770 --> 19:32.672
Catch me later.

19:37.944 --> 19:39.312
Hey, Chuck.

19:39.346 --> 19:40.613
She'll be right
with you.

19:40.647 --> 19:42.515
Any vomiting?

19:42.549 --> 19:45.418
He's alert,
good eye contact?

19:45.452 --> 19:47.787
Okay, okay, well, just call me
when his fever comes down.

19:47.820 --> 19:48.855
Okay, listen, I gotta go.

19:48.888 --> 19:51.458
All right, bye.
Bye, bye, Chuck.

19:51.491 --> 19:53.360
I've got the INS.

19:54.494 --> 19:56.629
This is Dr. Lewis.

19:56.663 --> 19:57.964
Yes, I am.

19:57.997 --> 19:59.699
She's dying.

19:59.732 --> 20:01.568
No, but there's something
you can do--

20:01.601 --> 20:02.869
you can give her son
a new hearing.

20:02.902 --> 20:05.438
She may not make it
another day.

20:05.472 --> 20:07.340
Thank you.

20:07.374 --> 20:08.508
Sure.

20:11.278 --> 20:12.779
I know she didn't want
to be force fed,

20:12.812 --> 20:14.481
but I gave her Ativan.

20:14.514 --> 20:16.483
Ativan doesn't have
any calories.

20:16.516 --> 20:20.553
Would you shock an end-stage
cancer patient with a DNR?

20:20.587 --> 20:21.888
What you did was
every bit as wrong.

20:21.921 --> 20:23.290
She was suffering.

20:23.323 --> 20:24.491
She was unconscious.

20:24.524 --> 20:26.326
I couldn't just
watch her die.

20:26.359 --> 20:27.794
Then you should have
left the room.

20:27.827 --> 20:29.696
It doesn't seem right.

20:31.998 --> 20:33.900
It's not.

20:33.933 --> 20:35.735
It's just the rules.

20:38.638 --> 20:40.373
Pre- and post-reduction hip.

20:40.407 --> 20:41.941
No fracture.

20:41.974 --> 20:43.476
And the lung's
expanded nicely.

20:43.510 --> 20:44.511
Good.

20:44.544 --> 20:45.578
What happened to you?

20:45.612 --> 20:46.646
Had a rough delivery.

20:46.679 --> 20:48.448
Hip lady's labs.

20:48.481 --> 20:49.616
Crit's okay?

20:49.649 --> 20:51.418
Yeah, but
calcium's 12.4.

20:51.451 --> 20:52.685
What caused the bump?

20:52.719 --> 20:53.820
It's a long
differential.

20:53.853 --> 20:55.622
But the top
two causes are...

20:55.655 --> 20:57.056
Hyperparathyroidism.

20:57.089 --> 20:58.758
And cancer.

21:00.593 --> 21:01.928
Yeah, you see these
rib fractures here.

21:01.961 --> 21:03.430
There's lesions underneath

21:03.463 --> 21:04.464
that may have
weakened the bone.

21:04.497 --> 21:05.932
Metastases.

21:05.965 --> 21:07.667
But that isn't where
the malignancy started.

21:07.700 --> 21:08.935
No. You have go to back

21:08.968 --> 21:11.504
and find the site
of the primary tumor.

21:11.538 --> 21:12.605
( sighs )
Damn.

21:12.639 --> 21:14.974
That sucks.
She's a nice lady.

21:15.007 --> 21:17.610
Yeah. I hear that's a
risk factor for cancer.

21:19.912 --> 21:21.581
Looks like the nose
is slightly cracked.

21:21.614 --> 21:23.683
And the knee is bruised.
Nothing serious.

21:23.716 --> 21:25.652
Oh, she's a tough one.

21:25.685 --> 21:29.622
You two have been mugged
several times in the past year.

21:29.656 --> 21:32.959
Occupational hazard.

21:32.992 --> 21:34.627
How come you have
to panhandle?

21:34.661 --> 21:36.829
Because they aren't
hiring at Hooters.

21:36.863 --> 21:38.365
( chuckles )

21:38.365 --> 21:40.099
I'm serious.
It's dangerous.

21:40.132 --> 21:43.370
Don't tell me you haven't
been smacked in here.

21:44.771 --> 21:46.873
What about Social Security?

21:46.906 --> 21:48.975
We have rent
and heating bills,

21:49.008 --> 21:51.077
electric, medications...

21:51.110 --> 21:53.446
Maybe we should
have Adult Services
make a home visit.

21:53.480 --> 21:54.581
Again?

21:54.614 --> 21:56.883
They went out
last summer.

21:56.916 --> 21:58.685
The place was
pretty messy.

21:58.718 --> 22:00.019
Well, we would've
cleaned it up

22:00.052 --> 22:01.721
if we knew they was coming.

22:01.754 --> 22:04.090
You didn't have much
food in the cabinets.

22:04.123 --> 22:07.727
We like to eat out.

22:10.463 --> 22:12.031
Is there anything
we can do to help you?

22:12.064 --> 22:15.468
We do just fine.

22:17.570 --> 22:19.639
I could request
another home visit.

22:19.672 --> 22:20.707
Suit yourself.

22:22.642 --> 22:24.744
I'll be back with your
discharge instructions.

22:24.777 --> 22:26.679
Yes, ma'am.

22:33.520 --> 22:35.455
TAGGART:
Still tachy at 120

22:35.488 --> 22:36.989
She can have
some more water.

22:37.023 --> 22:38.425
Dr. Lewis,

22:38.425 --> 22:40.627
navicular fracture
has his thumb spica.

22:40.660 --> 22:41.928
That the hunger
strike lady?

22:41.961 --> 22:43.162
Yeah.

22:43.195 --> 22:44.797
There's got to be
a better way.

22:44.831 --> 22:46.666
She's got no money,
no political influence.

22:46.699 --> 22:47.934
This is it.

22:47.967 --> 22:48.968
Ortho clinic in a week.

22:49.001 --> 22:50.770
You got it.

22:50.803 --> 22:53.940
She should at least
get to see her son.

22:53.973 --> 22:56.809
They know she's dying,
maybe they'd let him visit.

22:56.843 --> 22:58.645
Maybe he can
get her to eat.

22:58.678 --> 22:59.846
It's worth a shot.

22:59.879 --> 23:01.448
He'd better
get here fast.

23:02.982 --> 23:06.085
Thyroid feels good.

23:06.118 --> 23:08.955
You say I've got
holes in my bones?

23:08.988 --> 23:11.824
In two of the ribs.

23:11.858 --> 23:13.760
I should drink
more milk.

23:15.828 --> 23:17.564
I need to do
a breast exam next.

23:17.597 --> 23:19.499
What for?

23:19.532 --> 23:25.104
The bone lesions could've been
caused by spread of a tumor.

23:25.137 --> 23:27.206
You mean cancer?

23:27.239 --> 23:28.941
Possibly.

23:45.558 --> 23:47.026
Have you felt this before?

23:48.761 --> 23:50.062
A mass?

23:50.096 --> 23:51.698
Upper outer quadrant.
Five centimeters.

23:51.731 --> 23:52.799
Five?

23:52.832 --> 23:56.168
When did you
first notice it?

23:56.202 --> 23:58.137
Couple years ago.

23:58.170 --> 24:00.239
Why didn't you see a doctor?

24:00.272 --> 24:01.841
I've been fine.

24:01.874 --> 24:03.776
They could've caught this
before it spread.

24:03.810 --> 24:05.678
Surgery might not
be as effective

24:05.712 --> 24:07.113
at this advanced stage.

24:07.146 --> 24:08.681
You want to cut me?

24:08.715 --> 24:10.149
I don't think so.

24:10.182 --> 24:13.152
An operation might be part
of the treatment plan.

24:15.054 --> 24:16.222
Where are my clothes?

24:16.255 --> 24:17.657
Whoa. Okay, take it easy,
take it easy.

24:17.690 --> 24:19.258
You're all hooked up.

24:19.291 --> 24:20.727
I never should
have come here.
You have to stay.

24:20.760 --> 24:22.762
I don't want you
cutting into me.

24:22.795 --> 24:24.731
Okay. Relax.
Relax, please.
No!

24:24.764 --> 24:25.932
No!
It's okay.

24:25.965 --> 24:27.834
You don't cut into cancer.

24:27.867 --> 24:29.702
We're not going to.
I know what happens.

24:29.736 --> 24:31.971
Settle down.
You cut cancer, it spreads.

24:32.004 --> 24:34.707
Mrs. Graham.
It spreads...

24:34.741 --> 24:36.809
and you die.

24:36.843 --> 24:39.712
( cries )
Okay.

24:49.856 --> 24:51.290
Okay, wound check
in two days.

24:51.323 --> 24:53.225
We'll see you then.

24:53.259 --> 24:54.293
Thank you, Doctor.

24:54.326 --> 24:56.095
Bye-bye.

24:56.128 --> 24:58.998
Hey, hold on.

24:59.031 --> 25:03.169
Um, why don't you guys try
to have a nice dinner tonight.

25:03.202 --> 25:06.806
You are so sweet.

25:12.679 --> 25:15.314
Was that a 20?

25:15.347 --> 25:19.586
No wonder your patient
satisfaction scores
are so high.

25:19.619 --> 25:21.053
Are you waiting
on a run?

25:21.087 --> 25:22.254
Sort of.

25:22.288 --> 25:24.791
Later.
Yeah.

25:39.972 --> 25:41.307
Boxers would
stick out more.

25:41.340 --> 25:42.642
It could be
tighty-whities.

25:42.675 --> 25:43.643
Thong.

25:43.676 --> 25:44.977
Maybe Abby
can settle this.

25:45.011 --> 25:46.012
Settle what?

25:46.045 --> 25:47.313
Boxers or briefs?

25:49.248 --> 25:51.818
Actually goes commando.

25:51.851 --> 25:53.252
( chuckling )

25:53.285 --> 25:54.654
A hunger strike?

25:54.687 --> 25:56.022
It's been
41 days.

25:56.055 --> 25:58.090
Damn. All I heard was
she was protesting.

25:58.124 --> 26:00.126
She's weak--
lost a lot of weight.

26:00.159 --> 26:01.193
Can't you make her eat?

26:01.227 --> 26:02.695
That's why you're here.

26:02.729 --> 26:04.697
Do you want
to go in?

26:09.669 --> 26:11.938
Elena...

26:11.971 --> 26:13.673
Elena?

26:13.706 --> 26:15.775
Someone's
here to see you.

26:19.245 --> 26:20.647
Mami. Que tal?

26:20.647 --> 26:23.783
Santi. Mijo.
Mi vida.

26:23.816 --> 26:26.285
Take a step back.

26:26.318 --> 26:27.820
Is that necessary?

26:27.854 --> 26:29.188
He's still in custody.

26:29.221 --> 26:30.823
TAGGART:
Can you give
them a minute?

26:30.857 --> 26:32.291
Long as he keeps
his distance.

26:33.926 --> 26:35.795
¿Como estas, mijo?

26:35.828 --> 26:39.365
I'm okay.

26:39.398 --> 26:43.069
I haven't seen him
in six months.

26:43.102 --> 26:44.704
How long can she last?

26:44.737 --> 26:45.838
It's hard to know.

26:45.872 --> 26:47.073
A few days at most.

26:47.106 --> 26:47.907
You should be
helping her.

26:47.940 --> 26:49.075
We're trying.

26:49.108 --> 26:50.677
No, you're not doing anything.

26:50.710 --> 26:52.378
You're doctors.
You're supposed to help.

26:52.411 --> 26:55.381
Mami...

26:55.414 --> 26:58.150
please let these people
help you.

26:58.184 --> 27:00.119
People still think
that about cancer?

27:00.152 --> 27:01.387
It's an urban myth.

27:01.420 --> 27:03.289
No, not to her.
To her, it's a reality.

27:03.322 --> 27:04.691
It's superstition.

27:04.724 --> 27:05.825
Yeah, well,
there's no screening,

27:05.858 --> 27:07.393
no early detection
in her community.

27:07.426 --> 27:10.062
She only sees friends who are
diagnosed late in the disease.

27:10.096 --> 27:12.799
All right, look, check this out:
a guy with colon cancer--

27:12.832 --> 27:14.834
he comes in, he presents
with bowel obstruction.

27:14.867 --> 27:16.703
Gets surgery,
mets are everywhere.

27:16.703 --> 27:18.270
They do a colostomy,
they close him back up...

27:18.304 --> 27:19.438
He's dead in six months.

27:19.471 --> 27:21.307
Exactly.

27:21.340 --> 27:24.410
And all his friends say,
"he was fine until he
got the surgery."

27:24.443 --> 27:26.846
How are you doing,
Mrs. Graham?

27:26.879 --> 27:28.981
Have you had the chance to think
about what we discussed?

27:29.015 --> 27:31.083
I don't want no surgery.

27:31.117 --> 27:33.185
They just put a thin needle
into the lump

27:33.219 --> 27:34.754
and pull out some cells.

27:34.787 --> 27:36.022
What happens then?

27:36.055 --> 27:37.824
Well, based on the findings,

27:37.857 --> 27:40.326
we can recommend
the appropriate treatment.

27:40.359 --> 27:41.928
Like what?

27:41.961 --> 27:46.065
You know, that really depends
on the tumor.

27:46.098 --> 27:48.200
Could be radiation,
could be chemotherapy...

27:48.234 --> 27:50.770
No, I don't want that.

27:50.803 --> 27:52.271
Look, I'm
sorry, ma'am,

27:52.304 --> 27:53.439
but is this about money?

27:53.472 --> 27:55.174
You know, because with cancer,

27:55.207 --> 27:57.076
you qualify for state aid.

27:57.109 --> 28:00.179
It's not about money.

28:00.212 --> 28:03.249
Look, if the biopsy shows
a certain kind of tumor

28:03.282 --> 28:05.451
your options are very good.

28:05.484 --> 28:08.120
You could take medication
once a day

28:08.154 --> 28:09.789
and survive for years.

28:09.822 --> 28:12.925
You're telling me
I got cancer in my bones

28:12.959 --> 28:14.426
and all I got to do is
take a pill?

28:14.460 --> 28:16.462
If it's the right kind of tumor.

28:16.495 --> 28:18.130
I'll take the pill then.

28:18.164 --> 28:21.333
Okay, good, but first we
have to do the biopsy

28:21.367 --> 28:23.102
and make sure it'll work.

28:23.135 --> 28:24.303
No. No needles.
No surgery.

28:24.336 --> 28:25.371
I've had it for
two years

28:25.404 --> 28:27.306
and I've been
doing fine.

28:27.339 --> 28:30.076
We can't help you
if you don't let us.

28:30.109 --> 28:34.013
Who's going to help me get
to the doctor all the time?

28:34.046 --> 28:37.349
Going to stay with me when
I'm spitting up all night?

28:37.383 --> 28:39.786
Who's going to help me
up the stairs

28:39.819 --> 28:41.420
when I'm too weak to walk?

28:41.453 --> 28:44.323
Who's going to do that? You?

28:47.393 --> 28:49.161
Why do you want
to kill yourself?
To save you.

28:49.195 --> 28:50.196
She needs food.

28:50.229 --> 28:51.397
We know that.
Then feed her.

28:51.430 --> 28:52.431
Give her a sandwich
or something.

28:52.464 --> 28:53.499
She wouldn't eat it.

28:53.532 --> 28:55.034
You can force it
down her throat.

28:55.067 --> 28:56.535
Santi, please.

28:56.568 --> 28:58.304
I don't need your help.
I can take care of myself!

28:58.337 --> 28:59.806
Where can
we put him?

28:59.839 --> 29:01.373
TAGGART:
Family room.
Bring the van around.

29:01.407 --> 29:02.875
You say you want to help

29:02.909 --> 29:03.876
and all you do
is mess up everything.

29:03.910 --> 29:05.177
Don't talk like that.

29:05.211 --> 29:06.445
You should have just forgot
about me!

29:06.478 --> 29:08.314
I was better off in El Salvador!

29:08.347 --> 29:09.816
TAGGART:
I'm sorry.

29:09.816 --> 29:11.483
Hey... Hey!

29:11.517 --> 29:12.852
What is your problem?!

29:12.885 --> 29:14.020
She's the one with the problem.

29:14.053 --> 29:15.321
She's doing this for you!

29:15.354 --> 29:17.289
Well, I never asked her to.

29:17.323 --> 29:18.991
Come here.

29:21.060 --> 29:22.995
You know what?
Maybe we will
force-feed her.

29:23.029 --> 29:24.463
Because your getting
deported sounds

29:24.496 --> 29:26.232
like a pretty good
idea right now.

29:26.265 --> 29:27.433
I'll go back home.
I don't care.

29:27.466 --> 29:29.201
So you want to die?

29:29.235 --> 29:31.437
Look, it's not like she says,
I had a good life there.

29:31.470 --> 29:32.839
She ruined everything.

29:32.839 --> 29:34.406
She wanted you to be together.

29:34.440 --> 29:36.408
Right, yeah,
she worked two jobs.

29:36.442 --> 29:37.844
I hardly know her.

29:37.877 --> 29:40.312
She wanted
a better life for you.

29:40.346 --> 29:44.350
Oh yeah?
You think it worked out?

29:44.383 --> 29:46.552
She loves you.

29:46.585 --> 29:48.420
She isn't doing this for me.

29:48.454 --> 29:51.190
She's doing this because
she feels guilty.

29:51.223 --> 29:53.893
Just let her go if that's
what she wants.

29:53.926 --> 29:55.327
No. You don't mean that.

29:55.361 --> 29:58.130
Sure I do.

29:58.164 --> 30:00.032
Just let her die.

30:06.472 --> 30:08.040
( knocking )

30:10.476 --> 30:12.444
You have Mueller's chart?

30:12.478 --> 30:14.213
Oh, yeah.

30:14.246 --> 30:15.915
Sorry, I'm doing
three consults....

30:15.948 --> 30:18.317
That's all right.
I just need to co-sign it.

30:18.350 --> 30:20.552
You want to grab some lunch?

30:20.586 --> 30:22.454
I, uh...

30:22.488 --> 30:25.091
I have to get
up to the unit.

30:25.124 --> 30:26.592
Dinner?

30:26.625 --> 30:28.427
I don't know.

30:28.460 --> 30:30.462
Look, I feel bad
about everything.

30:32.431 --> 30:34.266
Me, too.

30:34.300 --> 30:35.968
I'm sorry.

30:39.405 --> 30:40.907
You know, I'm really good

30:40.940 --> 30:43.409
at getting in
my patient's heads.

30:43.442 --> 30:45.277
I wish I'd been able
to figure out

30:45.311 --> 30:46.612
what was going on in yours.

30:51.050 --> 30:53.319
I have to get up
to the ICU.

30:53.352 --> 30:54.653
There's a family waiting.

30:54.686 --> 30:56.322
You left some stuff
at my place.

30:56.355 --> 30:58.090
I could bring it
by sometime.

30:58.124 --> 30:59.658
I can come by tonight
and pick it up.

30:59.691 --> 31:01.293
Okay.

31:01.327 --> 31:03.129
Just leave 'em bag
on the front steps.

31:03.162 --> 31:07.066
Sure.
If that's what you want.

31:07.099 --> 31:08.534
Thanks.

31:16.442 --> 31:18.110
Doc, think she'll
eat now?

31:18.144 --> 31:19.345
Probably not.

31:19.378 --> 31:21.013
Too bad.
She'll die,

31:21.047 --> 31:22.548
and the kid will probably
still get deported.

31:22.581 --> 31:24.016
What about
the hearing?

31:24.050 --> 31:25.451
Not sure if it
will change anything.

31:25.484 --> 31:28.354
We'll see what
my boss says.

31:28.387 --> 31:30.256
Thanks for your help.

31:30.289 --> 31:32.324
Can't say we
didn't try.

31:32.358 --> 31:34.526
Dr. Lewis, Elena's
unresponsive.

31:34.560 --> 31:35.962
I checked the Internet.

31:35.962 --> 31:37.263
45 days.

31:37.296 --> 31:38.364
For what?

31:38.397 --> 31:40.299
IRA prisoners
in Belfast.

31:40.332 --> 31:42.134
They started dying
45 days after fasting.

31:42.168 --> 31:43.369
How long she
been going?

31:43.402 --> 31:45.237
Forty-one.

31:45.271 --> 31:47.439
Oh, Sam, a paramedic's
on the MICN.

31:50.009 --> 31:51.277
Hey, okay.

31:51.310 --> 31:53.179
I made all the revisions,
rewrote the abstract

31:53.212 --> 31:54.480
and conclusion.

31:54.513 --> 31:55.381
Morris, I can't deal
with this right now.

31:55.414 --> 31:57.083
We got an hour, okay?

31:57.116 --> 31:58.617
If you just look it over, I can
e-mail right away.

31:58.650 --> 32:00.219
We'll make the deadline.

32:00.252 --> 32:02.188
Look, it's important
to me, too. I'm sorry.

32:02.221 --> 32:03.255
Dr. Lewis, wait...
May I call you Susan?

32:03.289 --> 32:05.091
No.

32:05.124 --> 32:08.094
I need this publication for
my chief resident application.

32:08.127 --> 32:09.495
Trust me, Morris,
it's going to take

32:09.528 --> 32:11.130
a hell of a lot more than that.

32:21.173 --> 32:22.608
Convert the chest tube
to a Heimlich valve.

32:22.641 --> 32:24.176
Call for an ambulance

32:24.210 --> 32:25.577
and have a visiting nurse
drop in on her tomorrow.

32:25.611 --> 32:27.279
You're sending her home?

32:27.313 --> 32:28.647
We need to put a little bit
more pressure on her.

32:28.680 --> 32:30.016
I just tried.

32:30.049 --> 32:31.117
Not very hard.

32:31.150 --> 32:32.484
Well, we can't force her.

32:32.518 --> 32:34.153
Yeah, but we can help her.

32:34.186 --> 32:35.387
Maybe in a couple days

32:35.421 --> 32:37.289
she'll change her mind
and reconsider it.

32:37.323 --> 32:39.091
If she goes home,
she's not coming back.

32:39.125 --> 32:40.726
We're respecting her wishes.
That's the first step.

32:40.759 --> 32:42.228
Then maybe She'll get
into oncology.

32:42.261 --> 32:43.562
Or she's lost
to follow up.

32:43.595 --> 32:46.165
This lady doesn't have
a primary care doctor.

32:46.198 --> 32:49.168
She doesn't feel comfortable
with the medical system.

32:49.201 --> 32:51.370
That's what's
making it tough.

32:53.472 --> 32:54.473
I'm feeling a lot better.

32:54.506 --> 32:55.641
The beta-blockers
kicked in,

32:55.674 --> 32:56.642
so your heart rate's down.

32:56.675 --> 32:58.510
Cool.

32:58.544 --> 33:00.479
Overactive thyroid
can cause glaucoma.

33:00.512 --> 33:02.514
So I need to check
your eye pressures.

33:02.548 --> 33:04.316
Go for it.

33:04.350 --> 33:06.052
First a drop.

33:11.423 --> 33:14.560
Now this might feel
a little weird.

33:14.593 --> 33:17.363
Excuse me.
Need a Heimlich valve.

33:17.396 --> 33:18.430
( coughing )

33:18.464 --> 33:19.765
It's okay. It's okay.

33:19.798 --> 33:20.799
Did you use proparacaine?

33:20.832 --> 33:22.568
Yes.

33:22.601 --> 33:23.569
( yells )

33:23.602 --> 33:24.636
( screams )

33:24.670 --> 33:25.737
Did my eyeball come out?!

33:25.771 --> 33:27.173
Oh, my God!

33:27.206 --> 33:28.540
Chuny, ten of morphine
right away.

33:28.574 --> 33:30.342
Jake, dribble the local.

33:30.376 --> 33:32.178
Adrian, what's happening to you
is called a subluxed globe.

33:32.211 --> 33:33.479
Get me an attending right away.

33:33.512 --> 33:34.480
I think Kovac just got here.

33:34.513 --> 33:35.747
Everything's blurry.

33:35.781 --> 33:37.549
That's normal.
You're going to be okay.

33:37.583 --> 33:38.717
Adrian, Adrian,

33:38.750 --> 33:40.352
We need you to stay still.
I can't!

33:40.386 --> 33:42.388
You have to.

33:42.421 --> 33:43.789
Is that legal aid
lawyer still here?

33:43.822 --> 33:45.524
No. He had
to go to class.

33:45.557 --> 33:47.593
Turns out he's
a third year
law student.

33:47.626 --> 33:49.595
Cocky little bugger.

33:49.628 --> 33:51.663
Hey.

33:51.697 --> 33:55.534
Five more minutes
and I'd have given
him the Ativan myself.

33:55.567 --> 33:57.569
Hey, Sam, your hunger strike
lady's asking for you.

33:57.603 --> 33:58.437
In there?

33:58.470 --> 34:02.174
She's coming around.

34:02.208 --> 34:03.742
Elena, what do you need?

34:03.775 --> 34:07.813
The bathroom.
The bathroom.

34:07.846 --> 34:09.315
Where did this
come from?

34:09.348 --> 34:11.449
I don't know.

34:11.483 --> 34:14.152
I didn't have an order
for an I.V.

34:14.186 --> 34:16.222
With an amp of multivites?

34:16.255 --> 34:17.188
Did you do this?

34:17.223 --> 34:19.291
No.

34:19.324 --> 34:20.826
What's going on?

34:20.859 --> 34:22.494
Uh, well, Elena's
awake

34:22.527 --> 34:24.396
with an I.V.

34:24.429 --> 34:25.697
Yeah, I can see that.

34:25.731 --> 34:26.732
What is this?

34:26.764 --> 34:27.866
We just
came in.

34:27.899 --> 34:29.268
Could you two
step outside.

34:29.301 --> 34:30.469
I need to talk
to Elena alone.

34:33.371 --> 34:35.774
What happened?

34:35.806 --> 34:37.476
It's okay.

34:37.509 --> 34:40.446
Elena, it's okay.

34:40.478 --> 34:41.580
Wow.

34:41.612 --> 34:43.449
What?

34:43.482 --> 34:46.652
Who knew Lewis
could start an I.V.
all by herself.

34:52.858 --> 34:54.493
All right,
I'll stop by. Thanks.

34:54.525 --> 34:58.230
Hey, Pratt. We'll run the board
as soon as I help Abby.

34:58.264 --> 34:59.665
Okay. Need to go to Oncology

34:59.698 --> 35:00.666
for a bit.
Okay.

35:02.468 --> 35:04.336
Okay, Adrian,
keep looking down.

35:04.370 --> 35:05.571
Heard you needed
an attending.

35:05.604 --> 35:06.905
Welcome to your
night shift.

35:06.938 --> 35:08.440
Subluxed globe.
Scleral pressure's

35:08.474 --> 35:09.908
not doing it.
Okay, we need

35:09.941 --> 35:11.243
a Desmarres
retractor.

35:11.277 --> 35:12.278
We don't have one.

35:12.311 --> 35:13.912
Uh... do we have
a paper clip?

35:13.945 --> 35:15.814
A paper clip?
Yeah.

35:17.683 --> 35:19.685
You're sticking a
paper clip in my eye?

35:19.718 --> 35:21.320
Don't worry,
won't feel a thing.

35:21.353 --> 35:22.654
Oh, God.

35:22.688 --> 35:25.291
Okay, okay, okay. How
about some versed?

35:25.324 --> 35:27.726
Don't you have like an eye
specialist here or something?

35:31.763 --> 35:33.699
KOVAC:
Okay, insert between
the upper lid

35:33.732 --> 35:35.567
and the
superior rectus.

35:38.837 --> 35:40.206
It's tough.

35:40.239 --> 35:41.640
Jake, retract
the lid superior.

35:43.409 --> 35:44.676
Got it.

35:45.477 --> 35:46.778
Little bit more.

35:46.812 --> 35:48.214
Good. Cover the end

35:48.247 --> 35:50.482
and depress
with your ring finger.

35:58.557 --> 35:59.758
Okay.

35:59.791 --> 36:03.295
The eyelid... is
past the equator.

36:03.329 --> 36:04.630
Okay.

36:04.663 --> 36:05.897
Look up, Adrian.

36:08.934 --> 36:10.569
Oh, my God.

36:10.602 --> 36:11.770
I can see.

36:11.803 --> 36:13.539
JAKE:
Nice.

36:15.874 --> 36:18.244
I'm cold.

36:18.277 --> 36:19.678
They're getting you
some warm blankets.

36:21.347 --> 36:22.748
Did you do this?

36:25.351 --> 36:26.518
It's just one bag.

36:26.552 --> 36:28.454
After that,
it's up to you.

36:28.487 --> 36:30.489
I thought it was
up to me already.

36:30.522 --> 36:32.491
You know,
I talked to some reporters.

36:32.524 --> 36:33.925
You're getting
a lot of attention.

36:33.959 --> 36:34.926
Mmm.

36:34.960 --> 36:36.462
Because I'm dying.

36:36.495 --> 36:39.365
Here you go.

36:39.398 --> 36:41.500
The INS is taking
your demand

36:41.533 --> 36:43.469
for a hearing
very seriously.

36:43.502 --> 36:45.637
They don't want
the bad press.

36:49.608 --> 36:50.909
You have done

36:50.942 --> 36:52.344
all you can.

36:52.378 --> 36:54.546
It's okay to eat now.

36:54.580 --> 36:56.782
Not until
they let him stay.

36:56.815 --> 36:59.551
He wasn't always
like this.

36:59.585 --> 37:01.420
He was a good boy.

37:01.453 --> 37:03.689
He did a stupid thing
and then in jail,

37:03.722 --> 37:06.558
he joined the gang.

37:06.592 --> 37:08.394
You try so hard,
but never know

37:08.427 --> 37:09.528
how they'll turn out.

37:11.463 --> 37:15.301
All he has now
is anger and hate.

37:15.301 --> 37:17.303
But you want
to keep going?

37:17.303 --> 37:19.905
He's still my son...

37:19.938 --> 37:22.641
even though he doesn't
care about me.

37:22.674 --> 37:25.311
I think he does.

37:25.344 --> 37:28.046
He just doesn't know
how to show it.

37:28.079 --> 37:30.516
The last thing he said
on his way out

37:30.549 --> 37:33.685
was, "Please,
don't let her die."

37:40.091 --> 37:42.728
What time is the ambulance
coming to take me home?

37:42.761 --> 37:44.696
Should be in
about an hour.

37:44.730 --> 37:47.499
There's someone
I'd like you
to meet before you go.

37:48.600 --> 37:50.802
Long as it's
no surgeon.

37:50.836 --> 37:52.371
She's not even a doctor.

37:55.507 --> 37:56.708
Debra Graham,
I'd like you

37:56.742 --> 37:57.743
to meet May Crawford.

37:57.776 --> 37:58.744
Hello.

37:58.777 --> 38:00.546
What are you?

38:00.579 --> 38:02.013
A social worker?

38:02.047 --> 38:03.849
No.

38:03.882 --> 38:05.884
A psychologist.

38:05.917 --> 38:07.886
I'm a secretary
at an ad agency.

38:07.919 --> 38:10.389
And a breast-
cancer survivor.

38:10.422 --> 38:12.624
It's been
three years now.

38:12.658 --> 38:14.593
We'll let you two talk.

38:17.363 --> 38:18.964
I had some spots
on my bones.

38:18.997 --> 38:20.566
That's how they found it.

38:20.599 --> 38:21.933
Really?
They broke
my leg.

38:21.967 --> 38:23.369
They put
a rod inside.

38:23.402 --> 38:24.603
There's a cancer
support group

38:24.636 --> 38:25.771
upstairs and they

38:25.804 --> 38:26.972
have patient
navigators to help

38:27.005 --> 38:28.574
people get
through the system.

38:28.607 --> 38:30.876
Think it'll work?

38:30.909 --> 38:32.110
Maybe she'll
listen to her

38:32.143 --> 38:33.912
more than she'll
listen to us.

38:39.485 --> 38:40.586
CARTER:
Hey.

38:43.955 --> 38:46.792
I thought you were going
to leave it on the steps.

38:46.825 --> 38:50.496
Yeah, I got stuck doing
an L.P. on a 300-pound guy.

38:52.998 --> 38:54.500
It's cold, huh?

38:54.533 --> 38:57.636
Yeah. Springtime in Chicago.

38:57.669 --> 39:00.105
Want to come in for a
second and get warm?

39:00.138 --> 39:02.474
I don't think so.

39:02.508 --> 39:03.609
You have my stuff?

39:03.642 --> 39:04.810
Yeah.

39:04.843 --> 39:05.911
Hang on a second.

39:07.145 --> 39:09.448
( phone ringing )

39:11.983 --> 39:13.485
Thanks.

39:13.519 --> 39:14.586
( phone still ringing )

39:14.620 --> 39:15.821
You need to get that?

39:15.854 --> 39:17.989
No, the machine
will pick it up.

39:19.658 --> 39:21.460
Sure you don't
want to come in?

39:21.493 --> 39:24.463
I can make some coffee.
Or some tea.

39:25.664 --> 39:27.132
No, I should get going.

39:29.568 --> 39:30.836
Yeah.

39:32.538 --> 39:34.440
Good night, John.

39:34.473 --> 39:35.607
Good night.

39:43.148 --> 39:44.950
Thought we did
a pretty good job

39:44.983 --> 39:46.585
getting that kid's
eyeball back in.

39:46.618 --> 39:48.454
Yes, we're
a pretty good team.

39:48.487 --> 39:50.121
Yeah, this is Abby,
she's my....

39:50.155 --> 39:51.590
teammate.

39:51.623 --> 39:53.492
This is Abby,
she's my...

39:53.525 --> 39:54.493
partner?

39:54.526 --> 39:55.627
No.

39:55.661 --> 39:57.696
Sounds like we work
at a law firm.

39:57.729 --> 39:59.465
How about...

39:59.498 --> 40:01.467
"my special friend"?

40:01.500 --> 40:03.602
What are you afraid
that people will think?

40:03.635 --> 40:04.936
What?

40:04.970 --> 40:06.572
This morning,
that's what you said.

40:10.642 --> 40:12.878
I just don't want
us to go too fast

40:12.911 --> 40:15.481
and get ahead
of ourselves.

40:15.514 --> 40:16.948
You have two
weeks to decide.

40:16.982 --> 40:18.617
Decide what?

40:18.650 --> 40:20.151
How fast you
want to go.

40:20.185 --> 40:22.488
How you'd like
to be referred to.

40:22.521 --> 40:23.822
What happens
in two weeks?

40:23.855 --> 40:25.123
Big family thing.
Oh, yeah?

40:25.156 --> 40:27.058
Yeah. It's like
a Saturday brunch.

40:27.092 --> 40:28.126
Okay.

40:28.159 --> 40:29.495
And before that,

40:29.528 --> 40:31.463
we're gonna have
to go to church.

40:32.731 --> 40:33.965
Church?

40:33.999 --> 40:35.734
Yeah. My niece is
getting baptized.

40:35.767 --> 40:36.968
I have to hold her.

40:37.002 --> 40:38.537
Oh, you're
the godfather.

40:38.570 --> 40:40.171
Yeah. If something
happens to the parents,

40:40.205 --> 40:41.807
I'm responsible.

40:41.840 --> 40:42.974
That sort of thing.

40:43.008 --> 40:45.644
Mm-hmm. So I'm
going to a baptism

40:45.677 --> 40:47.479
as the godfather's...?

40:48.680 --> 40:49.948
Fill in the blank.

40:52.918 --> 40:54.820
Doctor Carter, Ed Miyamoto.

40:54.853 --> 40:56.121
The revised architect's
plans'll be

40:56.154 --> 40:57.956
in my office Friday.
Stop on by.

40:57.989 --> 40:59.525
( beeps )

40:59.558 --> 41:02.661
Hello. If your current
mortgage rate is...

41:02.694 --> 41:03.662
( beeps )

41:03.695 --> 41:04.696
KEM:
Hi, John.

41:04.730 --> 41:06.698
About 6:00 in the morning here.

41:06.732 --> 41:08.700
Just wanted to say hello.

41:08.734 --> 41:13.539
You can call, but I'm leaving
for work in an hour. Bye.

41:26.585 --> 41:27.686
Hey. Hi.

41:27.719 --> 41:29.688
It's me.

41:29.721 --> 41:32.891
I wasn't sure
I was gonna catch you.

41:32.924 --> 41:35.894
Well, I just
got home from work.

41:35.927 --> 41:37.763
It was good.

41:37.796 --> 41:40.031
I looked at the plans today.

41:40.065 --> 41:44.235
Yeah, and I've been thinking
about a name for the building.

41:44.269 --> 41:46.772
Well, how would you
feel about...

41:46.805 --> 41:48.674
The Joshua Carter Center?

41:51.610 --> 41:52.678
Yeah, after the baby.

41:57.816 --> 42:01.052
For the first two days,
it's pretty much all I.V.,

42:01.086 --> 42:03.855
but we can try a small
amount of clear liquids.

42:05.356 --> 42:07.092
That's it?

42:07.125 --> 42:10.095
Just a few spoonfuls
until your stomach
gets used to it.

42:12.163 --> 42:15.100
I swore I wouldn't stop
until he was safe.

42:18.770 --> 42:21.740
( praying in Spanish )

42:21.773 --> 42:23.609
Amen.

42:23.609 --> 42:25.644
Bless us, O Lord,
and these Thy gifts

42:25.677 --> 42:27.012
which we are
about to receive

42:27.045 --> 42:30.949
from Thy bounty
through Christ our Lord.

42:30.982 --> 42:33.018
Keep my son away from harm.

42:33.051 --> 42:35.621
Amen.

42:35.654 --> 42:36.755
Amen.
Amen.

42:36.788 --> 42:40.058
( phone ringing )

42:42.127 --> 42:43.629
Hello.

42:43.662 --> 42:45.196
Uh, yeah. Hey.

42:45.230 --> 42:47.098
Okay, hold on.

42:47.132 --> 42:48.934
Dr. Lewis, it's
Chuck on line four.

42:48.967 --> 42:50.736
Oh. I'll take it
in the hallway.

43:04.883 --> 43:05.851
Okay.

43:05.884 --> 43:07.853
Okay, put him on.

43:07.886 --> 43:10.789
Hi, baby. It's Mommy.

43:10.822 --> 43:13.992
Yeah, you need
to go to bed for Daddy, okay?

43:14.025 --> 43:16.795
I'll be home soon.

43:16.828 --> 43:21.132
No, I'm sorry,
I can't do that right now.

43:21.166 --> 43:22.133
Yeah.

43:22.167 --> 43:23.134
All right.

43:23.168 --> 43:26.805
All right, I'll try.

43:26.838 --> 43:29.808
"One hippo, all alone,

43:29.841 --> 43:33.879
"Calls two hippos on the phone.

43:33.912 --> 43:36.815
"Three hippos at the door.

43:36.848 --> 43:39.685
"Bring along another four.

43:39.718 --> 43:43.154
"Five hippos come over-dressed.

43:43.188 --> 43:46.825
"Six hippos show up
with a guest.

43:46.858 --> 43:49.828
"Seven hippos arrive in a sack.

43:49.861 --> 43:53.164
"Eight hippos sneak in the back.

43:53.198 --> 43:56.902
"Nine hippos come to work.

43:56.935 --> 44:01.372
All the hippos go berserk."
